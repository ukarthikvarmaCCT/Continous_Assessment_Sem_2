 The Delhi government has said to take over 449 schools
 sarkaar ne ye baat dilli hoicourt ko die apane halafname main kahi he
 Actually, this case is related to non-refund of increased fees to parents by private schools
 kejariwal sarkaar ne kaha he ki agar skool fees waapas nahi karenge to 449 nijee skulon kaa prabandhan apane haathon main le legi
 The government said in the High Court that the process of issuing a 'show cause' notice to take over the management of all these non-refundable private schools has been completed and it has been sent to the Lieutenant Governor for approval

 In fact, in 2011, the Anil Dev Committee was constituted by the High Court to investigate about one thousand private schools charging arbitrary fees of 32 months from 2006-2009
 pichley 6 saal main anil dev cameti 11 report court ko saunp chuki he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki kareeb 544 skulon ne zarurat naa hone par bhi apane skool main fees badhaai
 The court had instructed the schools to return these 32 months (up to 2006-2009) fees to parents with 9% interest
 lekin ab tak 15-20 skulon ne hi ye fees court main jamaa karaayi he
 However, the High Court has also questioned the government's intention to take over private schools
 court ne sarkaar se poocha he ki jab sarkari skulon ko hi thik se chalaane ke liye aapke paas staff nahi he to itani bady sankhya main privet skulon ko aap tech over karke kaise chalaaoge
 Now the next hearing of this matter will be held on September 6 and on the same day the Delhi government will have to tell what government resources they have at the grassroots level regarding their take over plan

 Amitabh Ghosh had expressed his displeasure over his 2016 book The Great Derangement and said that literary novelists have failed to combat climate change

 In this, Ghosh is raising questions about human uncertainty, prudence, reasoning, empiricism, and everything we think we know

 romance kii talash main vah khud ko kalakatta main paata he, jahaan america kii apni sant sareekhee jindagi ke bilkul ulat vah khud ko tamaam saamaajik sthitiyon main jhonk detaa he
 At a party, she meets a "smooth-talking, hollow, prematurely old and all-you-know" relative (who the readers know from Ghosh's Sunderbans novel The Hungry Tide), and he finds her in guns

 Deenanath finds the gun trader somewhat alien and mysterious enough to spend his life exploring the seemingly impossible places in Sunderbans, Venice and Los Angeles, among others
 aisa karte hue vah tark or vivek par apni puri pakad takreeban kho baithta he
 He tells his friend and famous professor, Giacinta Schiavone, "it's a strange feeling, as if i didn't live in amity

 khud apane bheetar hi gaayab ho jane ke jokhim se guzar rahaa yah aadmi deenanath baahar kii duniya se takaraane ke liye majaboor kar diya jaataa he
 It has to find connections between snakes, the elemental soil of the Sundarbans, the supernatural merits of folklore and the current ecological and human disasters where migrants are forced to leave their homes in such a large number and in such circumstances that the home The idea itself has become old and useless
 gan island hameshaa bahut yakini nahin he, magar yah hamen sawaal poochne par majaboor kar detaa he ki vah kya he jise ham yakini maanate hai

 It is generally believed that government schools do not have good education than private schools

 This is the case of a government school in Bariatu area of ranchi, where children are taught in a unique way

 mumbai kii sabase badi auto rickshaw union dwaara somvaar ko aahut ek din kii hadtaal ke kaaran lakhon yatriyon va vidhyaarthiyon ko baari asuvidha kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The strike took effect only in the suburbs of Mumbai, as there is a ban on entry of auto rickshaws in the Mumbai part after Bandra
 sharad raav ke netritv vaale mumbai autoricshamens union (emeyu) ne nunatam kiraye main ek rupee kii vruddhi karne ke baavjood yah hadtaal kii he
 The Regional Transport Authority (RTA) had last week raised the minimum fare for an auto rickshaw from Rs 11 to Rs 12
 emeyu se sambhddha 20,000 se adhik autoricshaw aadhi raat se hi sadakon se hat gaye
 While auto rickshaw organizations affiliated to Congress, Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena have opposed the strike and are trying to deal with the situation created by the strike, their efforts are proving to be inadequate due to the low numbers
 is hadtaal ke kaaran best bason kii intjaar karne vaale yatriyon kii lambii kataren lagi raheen, jabaki pariksha dene vaale vidhyaarthiyon ne samay par pariksha kendron tak pahunchane ke liye padhai ke moolyawaan samay ko tilanjali dekar pehle hi ghar se nikalnaa behatar samajha
 Due to this strike, the load on the buses increased and despite arranging additional buses, there was a huge rush in the buses
 tippaniyan Haresh Shah, standing in the queue of Best Bus for over an hour, said that all types of public transport should be brought under essential service
 shah ne kaha, "ek chota sa samooh shahar ke puure yatri samudaay ko kaise bandhak bana saktaa he?" andheri main ek nijee company main kaam karne vaali priya ghanekar ne kaha ki is tarah ke auto rickshaw hadtaal ke dauraan texiyon ko upnagaron main vishesh parichaalan kii anumati di jaani chahie
 Last week, Rao of MAU announced a statewide indefinite strike, which was expected to involve about 1 million auto rickshaws
 lekin anya sanghathanon ke asahyog or artie dwaara nunatam kiraye main ek rupee kii vruddhi kii anumati dene ke baad raav apane rukh se peeche hat gaye or unhone vyapak va anischitkaaleen hadtaal ko ek din ke sankethik hadtaal main badal diya
 The strike has been carried out by Sharad Rao-led Mumbai autorecisions Union (MAU) despite raising the minimum fare by one rupee
 kshetreey parivahan praadhikaran (artie) ne pichley saptaah auto rickshaw kaa nunatam kiraaya 11 rupee se badhaakar 12 rupee kar diya tha
 More than 20,000 autorickshaws affiliated with MAU took off from the streets since midnight
 jabaki congress, shivasena or maharashtra navnirmaan sena se sambhddha auto rickshaw sanghathanon ne is hadtaal kaa virodh kiya he or hadtaal se utpann sthiti se nipatane kii koshish main lage hue hai, lekin kam sankhya ke kaaran unki yah koshish naakaafi sabit ho rahi he
 This strike led to long queues of passengers waiting for the best buses, while the students who took the exam thought it was better to leave the house before leaving the valuable time of study to reach the examination centers on time
 is hadtaal ke kaaran bason par bhaar bad gaya or atirikt bason kii vyavastha karne ke baavjood bason main baari bheed rahi
 The comments ek ghante se best bas kii qatari main khadey haresh shah ne kaha ki har tarah ke saarvajanik parivahan ko aavashyak seva ke tahat laayaa janaa chahie
 Shah said, "how can a small group hold the entire passenger community of the city hostage?" Priya Ghanekar, who works in a private company in Andheri, said that during such auto rickshaw strike, taxis should be allowed special operations in the suburbs
 pichley saptaah emeyu ke raav ne rajyavyapee anischitkaaleen hadtaal kii ghoshnaa kii thi, jisamen lagbhag 10 lakh auto rickshon ke shaamil hone kii sambhaavna thi
 But after non-cooperation of other organizations and the RTA allowing an increase in the minimum fare by one rupee, Rao retreated from his stand and turned the broad and indefinite strike into a one-day token strike
 is hadtaal ke kaaran best bason kii intjaar karne vaale yatriyon kii lambii kataren lagi raheen, jabaki pariksha dene vaale vidhyaarthiyon ne samay par pariksha kendron tak pahunchane ke liye padhai ke moolyawaan samay ko tilanjali dekar pehle hi ghar se nikalnaa behatar samajha

 It has been 15 years since there were fights while working together

 Arun Jaitley and BJPK are now surrounded by the opposition leaders who have been vocal on the rising prices of petrol and diesel and they have also been pressurized by a cut of five rupees

 After the reduction of Rs 5 in BJP ruled states, pressure has been increased in states where the opposition is in power

 No Congress-ruled state has cut oil prices after Jaitley's challenge
 karnataka ne eendhan keemton main or katautee karne se manaa kar diya he
 In such a situation, it is bound to increase the pressure on Congress President Shahul Gandhi, who is vocal about the increased prices of petrol and diesel
 jabaki punjab ne shuukravaar ko is par nirnay lene kii baat kahi he
 Similarly, TMC chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has not cut VAT

 That is why it is not easy for them to cut back now

 So far they have not cut the state tax on fuel prices

 The cost of medicine in India is increasing and one of the reasons is that many pharmaceutical and equipment companies are charging huge amount from patients
 in marijon kii sud lene vaala koi nahin he kyonki is field main koi regulator nahin he
 According to an English newspaper, medical equipment companies are charging between Rs 60,000 and Rs 1 lakh for stents (DEC) for heart patients
 kuch to isse bhi zyada vasuulati hai jabaki dil main lagaae jane vaale stant kii keemat europe or euke ke viksit deshon main bhi 28 se 48 hajaar rupee tak hi hoti he
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the Maharashtra government conducted a detailed investigation into the exorbitant price of such devices, including stents, and reported to the National Pharma Pricing Authority (NPPA)
 uskaa kahana tha ki stant sahati is tarah ke medical upkarnon ko price control ke tahat laayaa jaae
 He said that more than 100 percent of the price is being charged from patients for such devices
 is report main udhaaharan diya gaya ki kaise mumbai kii ek company ne drug-iluiting stant 40,710 rupee main emport kiya
 He then gave it to the distributor for Rs 73,440
 usne stant ko mubai ke ek nami aspataal ko 1
 1 lakh for Rs
 aspataal ne marij ko uske liye 1
 Rs 2 lakhs recovered
 matlab hua ki marij se lagbhag teen guna charge kiya gaya
 The reason for this loot is that such devices are not covered under drug price control and hence their arbitrary prices are being charged
 multi neshnal companiyaan unka emport karti hai or un par manamaana daam likhakar bechati hai

 Jai said that the direct benefit of the riots in Bengal is reaching Mamta
 jai ne kaha ki marks ne kaha relijan ij opium for maces, mamata ne kaha ki relijan ij vot bank politics and modi ne kaha ki relijan samaaj kaa vot bank he
 This is the difference of thinking
 mamata sarkaar ne durga puja par pratibandh lagaaya lekin hoicourt ne kaha ki sarkaar galat he
 Malini Bhattacharya said that Jai claims to be my student
 lekin unhone kuch bhi siikhaa nahin
 Malini said that the left has not been recorded in history

 "srilekha said," i encourage them, stand with them

 Things have changed, at least in Kolkata
 " mujhe lav seen yaa kising seen main dikkat nahin
 But there is a problem in speaking the dialogues of double meaning

 The dream of making Delhi a city of dreams is currently stuck
 modi sarkaar ne rajdhani ko duniya ke behtareen shaharon main shumaar karne kaa jo vaada kiya tha, philhal vah puraa nahin hoga
 Because, the Modi government has put the plan of polishing Delhi in abeyance
 modi sarkaar chaahati he ki wo rajdhani ko world class city kaa darja de sake
 But the Kejriwal government of Delhi wants the infrastructure to be strengthened before the world class
 sawaal ye he ki piem modi or siem kejariwal ke bich dilli kii surat aakhirkaar kisi hogi?dilli ko sanvaarane ke liye modi sarkaar or kejariwal sarkaar ke vijan or planning donon kaaphi alag hai
 Both the governments have prepared the plans for the capital on paper, there is a difference of ground-sky
 dilli ko world class banane kii planning ko lekar oktober-november 2014 main modi sarkaar ne 6 hai level meeting kii
 It included 19 Ministries including Railways, Road Transport, Ministry of Defense
 dilli sarkaar ke kai vibhaag bhi meeting kaa hissaa bane
 The Modi government created a 9-point agenda
 inamen nai parking ke liye 10 karod rupee dene kaa bajet bana
 a plan of Rs 2,670 crore for metro, railway, bus connectivity
 cycle trek or usase judi suvidhaon ke liye 2500 karod kaa plan
 800 crore budget for new types of roads and footpaths
 behtareen bas suvidha ke liye 2000 karod or birarti ke liye 1860 karod rupee kaa bajet banaaya
 a budget of Rs
30, 000 crores was prepared for the flyover and bypass
 intellegent transport system ke liye 1200 karod, planning or monitering ke liye 10 karod rupee kaa bajet
 41,000 crore rupees planned to make Delhi a world class city
 modi sarkaar ne dilli ko sanvaarane ke liye vidhansabha chunaav se pehle hi taiyaariyaan shuru kar di thim
 However, after the aap's victory in the election results, everything went in cold storage
 modi sarkaar ke sapane or 41 hajaar karod rupee kii planning ko kejariwal sarkaar ne bemaani qaraar diya he
 The Delhi government says that the Center only made the plan, but did not give the money
 41 hajaar karod rupee kii yojanaon ke naam par sirf 300 karod rupee jari kiye gaye hai
 In such a situation, how will the dream of world class Delhi be fulfilled? The Kejriwal government claims that it is not concerned about Modi's dreams but about providing basic amenities to the people of Delhi
 isiilie, kaamkaaj ke ek maheene kaa report card pesh karte hue kejariwal sarkaar ne modi ke sapanom kii dilli kaa koi zikr nahin kiya tha
 It is clear from the stand of the Delhi Government that work has not even started towards making the capital a world class city
 kyonki, kejariwal sarkaar aam aadmi ko achche dinon kaa ehsaas karana chaahati he
 Therefore, under its planning, all the basic things will be converted into reality
 yani modi sarkaar ke liye dilli ko apane tareeke se sanvaarane kaa sapana puraa kar paanaa aasaan nahin hoga
 This is the planning of the Modi government; Delhi is so far ahead of the rest of the cities in many cases
 metro samet tamaam aisi suvidhaayen hai, jo desh kii rajdhani ko tarakkee kii raah main badhata hua dikhaa rahi hai
 The central government has made some special plans to increase the speed and speed of trains in Delhi
 modi sarkaar ne dilli ko world class city banane ke liye fliover or alivated road kaa jaal bichaane kii planning kii he
 There is a plan to construct Najafgarh elevated road for about 30 km
 ye road 2018 tak puri hogi, jisamen 400 karod rupee kii laagat aegi
 There are plans to take Mehrauli Badarpur Road to Noida
 iske liye 2750 karod rupee or 2018 tak kaam puraa karne kaa target he
 There are plans to build the East West Corridor
 iske tahat anand vihaar se nai dilli or punjabi baag tak 2500 karod rupee kharch karke special coridor banane kii planning he
 According to the plan of the Center, there is a plan to build one and a half kilometer tunnel road from Lodhi Road to Mathura Road
 tunnel road banane main kareeb 600 karod rupee kaa kharch aayega
 Apart from this, there is a plan to build a better road from Mahipalpur bypass to NH 8 by spending Rs 630 crore
 barapula phej 4 ke tahat dhaulakuan se asaf ali road tak 1000 karod rupee kharch karke 6 kilometre road banane kii planning he
 The Modi government has made plans for about 15 projects related to road and flyovers
 ye he kejariwal sarkaar kii planningkejariwal sarkaar ke kaamkaaj kaa tarika modi sarkaar se kai myanon main alag he
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is promising to provide basic facilities in Delhi
 unka jor bhi tamaam buniyadi muddon par hi he
 He has already announced to give direct relief to the public on issues like electricity and water
 ab unka focus dilli ke kuch aise buniyadi muddon par he, jin par kai saal se koi dhyaan nahin diya gaya
 The Kejriwal government plans to open 500 new government schools in Delhi
 secondry or senior secondry ajukeshan ko behatar banane par jor diya jayega
 Delhi government will launch Higher Education Guarantee Scheme
 iske tahat barahavin ke baad chaatr yaa chaatra ko sarkaar kii guarantee par lone milegaa

 assam ke chirang jile ke ek bazaar main shuukravaar ko ugravadi samooh endiefabi (songbeijit) ke sashastr ugravadi khaane or garm kapadon kii kharidari karne ke liye pahunche jisase vyapaaree or log bhaybheet ho gaye lekin ugravadi police ke pahunchane se pehle hi vahaan se nikal gaye
 Locals and businessmen said that around 15 militants arrived at Amteka Bazar at 11
20 am and then returned to their camps in the foothills of the northern Himalayas near the indo-bhutan border
 unhone kaha ki bazaar main khadey log or vyapaaree ugravadiyon ko dekhakar vahaan se bhaag gaye
 District Superintendent of Police Sanjit Krishna said that after getting the information he reached the market along with police, army and CRPF personnel and started a search operation to apprehend the militants
 aam aadmi party main machaa ghamaasan ab puri tarah saarvajanik ho chaku he
 Two groups have started appearing directly inside the party
 pehle arvind kejariwal gut ke netaaon ne prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav par gambhir aarope lagaae, jiske jawaab main donon ne kaaryakartaaon ke naam ek aath pannon kii chitthee likhi he
 In the letter, Yogendra and Prashant have made serious allegations against Kejriwal
 unhone likhaa he ki party ne sampradayik poster lagane vaale ko ummidavaar banaaya or loksabhaa kii haar ke baad kejariwal congress ke saath sarkaar bananaa chaahate the
 Making the copy of the letter public, Yogendra Yadav said, 'there has been a lot of discussion in the party for the last several days
 kal subah hamaare chaar saathiyon ne bayaan diya tha
 After that Prashant and i said that we welcome it and will respond to it in writing
 isliye maine or prashanth ji ne violentier ke naam ek chitthee likhi he
 An attempt has been made in the letter to convey all the issues to the workers
 taaki swasthy samvaad ho sake
 We have decided that for now we will not say anything else on this issue
 'padhein, kaaryakartaaon ke naam yogendra-prashanth kii chitthee-11 march 2015pyaare doston,hamen pataa he ki pichley kuch dinon kii ghatnaon se desh or duniya bhar ke aap sabhi kaaryakartaaon ke dil ko bahut thes pahaunchi he
 The enthusiasm created by the historic victory of Delhi elections is getting colder
 aap hi kii tarah har walantier ke man main yah sawaal uth rahaa he ki abhootpurv lahar ko sametane or aage badhane kii is ghadi main yah gatirodh kyon? kaaryakarta yahi chaahate hai ki sheersh par foot na ho, koi tut na ho
 An ordinary volunteer feels helpless and insulted when reports of differences between top party leaders come on TV and on newspaper, accusations and counter-accusations
 is sthiti se ham bhi gahari pidaa main hai
 Keeping in mind the party's interest and the sentiments of all you activists, both of us have not added anything to this link of allegation in the last ten days
 kuch zaruri sawaalon ke jawaab die, lekin apni taraf se sawaal nahin puche
 We repeatedly appealed to activists and supporters to maintain faith in the party
 vyaktigat rup se ham sabaki simaaen hoti hai lekin sanghathan main ham ek-duusare kii kami ko puraa kar lete hai
 That is why the organization is bigger and more important than any of us
 isi soch ke saath hamane aaj tak party main kaam kiya he or aage bhi kaam karte rahenge
 But yesterday after the public statement of four comrades (shri Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, Gopal Rai and Pankaj Gupta), we are forced to break our silence with a heavy heart
 rashtriya kaaryakarini main bahumat kii raay mukherit karne vaale is bayaan ko party ke media cell kii ore se prasaarit kiya gaya, or party ke aadhikarik fasebuk, twitor or website par chalaaya gaya
 In such a situation, if we remain silent then it will be understood that there is some truth in the allegations made in this statement
 isliye ham aap ke saamne puraa sach rakhana chaahate hai
 Please make one thing clear before proceeding
 uparokt bayaan main ham donon ke saath shanti bhushan ji ko bhi jod kar kuch aarope lagaaye gaye hai
 As is well known, before the Delhi elections, Shanti Bhushan ji made many statements that could damage the party's image and the party's electoral preparedness
 unke in bayanon se party ke kaaryakartaaon main niraashaa or asantosh paidaa hua
 On such occasions both of us publicly disagreed with the statements of Shanti Bhushan
 chunki in muddon par ham donon kii raay shanti bhushan ji se nahin milti he, isliye behatar hoga ki unase jude prashnon ke uttar unase hi puche jaye
 Read further, the post of convenor is nothing else, it is necessary to refute another false belief related to the issue of differences
 pichley do hafte main baar-baar yah prachaar kiya gaya he ki yah sara matbhed rashtriya sanyojak ke pad ko lekar he
 It was said that there was a conspiracy going on to replace Arvind Bhai and make Yogendra Yadav the convenor
 sach ye he ki ham donon ne aaj tak kisi bhi aupchaarik yaa anaupchaarik baithak main aisa koi zikr nahin kiya
 When the proposal for Arvind Bhai's resignation came in the meeting on 26 February, we both voted to reject his resignation
 or kuch bhi mudda ho, rashtriya sanyojak kaa pad na to mudda tha, na he
 After knowing this truth, all volunteers ask, "if there was no dispute over the post of national convenor, then what was the dispute? How did such deep differences begin? " We kept silence on this question as much as possible, so that the matter does not go out of the walls of the house
 lekin ab hamen mahasoos hota he ki jab tak aapako yah pataa nahin lagegaa tab tak aapke man main bhi andeh or anishchay paidaa ho saktaa he
 Therefore, we are mentioning the main things below, due to which our differences with Arvind Bhai and some other colleagues have arisen in the last ten months
 aap hi bataaen, kya hamen yah mudde uthaane chahie the yaa nahin?1
 As soon as the results of the Lok Sabha elections came, Arvind Bhai proposed that we now form the government again in Delhi with support from the Congress
 samajhane-bujhane kii tamaam koshishon ke baavjood ve or kuch anya sahyogi is baat par ade rahe
 Most of the mlas of Delhi supported him
 lekin dilli or desh bhar ke jis-jis kaaryakarta or netaa ko pataa laga, adhikansh ne iskaa virodh kiya, or party chhodane tak kii dhamkee di
 The party had demanded dissolution of the assembly in the High Court
 yun bhi congress party lok sabha chunaav main janata dwaara khaarij kii ja chuki thi
 In such a situation, a coalition with the Congress could end the party's credibility
 hamane party ke bheetar yah awaz uthaai
 It also urged that any such decision be p
 e
 C
 and be done according to the opinion of the National Executive
 lekin leftinent governor ko chitthee likhi gayi or sarkaar banane kii koshish hui
 This effort continued till the month of November, just before the dissolution of the Legislative Assembly
 (yahan va is chitthee main kai or jagah ham party hit main kuch gopneey baaten saarvajanik nahin kar rahe hai) ham donon ne sanghathan ke bheetar har manch par iskaa virodh kiya
 The deepest differences lay on this question
 yah faisla ham aap par chhodte hai ki yah virodh karnaa uchit tha yaa nahin
 Had the party formed a government with the Congress at that time, would we have won the trust of the people of Delhi again? 2

 a
 si
 The resignation offer was related to this incident
) If we did not oppose such unconstitutional moves then what difference would have been made between our party and the party like Congress or BSP? 3
 maharashtra, haryana, jharkhand or jammu-kashmir main party ke chunaav ladane ke sawaal par party kii june maah kii rashtriya kaaryakarini main party kaaryakartaaon kaa mat jaanane kaa nirdesh diya gaya tha
 After knowing the opinion of the activists, it was the opinion of the majority of us and the national executive that the decision to contest elections in the states should be left to the discretion of the state unit
 yah aravind bhai ko manzur naa tha
 He said that if the party contested elections anywhere, they would not go to campaign
 unke aagrah ko sweekaar karte hue rashtriya kaaryakarini ko apana faisla palatnaa padaa, or rajyon main chunaav na ladane kaa faisla hua
 Today this decision seems right, the party has benefited from it
 lekin sawaal yah he ki bhavishya main aise kisi faisle ko kaise liya jaay? kya swaraj ke siddhant main nishtha rakhane vaali hamaari party main rajyon kii swaayatata kaa sawaal uthaanaa galat he?4
 In July, when some Muslim mlas of the Congress were rumored to have joined the BJP, an anonymous communal and inflammatory poster was put up in Muslim areas in Delhi
 police ne aarope lagaaya ki yah poster party ne lagavaaya tha
 Arrested Mr
 Dilip Pandey and two other volunteers as accused in this case
 is poster kii jimmedaari party ke ek kaaryakarta shri amanatullah ne lee, or aravind bhai ne unki giriftaari kii maang kii (baad main unhen okhla kaa prabharee or phir party kaa ummidavaar banaaya gaya) yogendra ne saarvajanik bayaan diya ki aise poster aam aadmi party kii vichaardhaara ke khilaaf hai
 Also expressed confidence that the arrested fellows in this case have no connection with this incident
 party ne ek ore to kaha ki in posters se hamaara koi lenaa dena nahin he, lekin duusari ore yogendra ke is bayaan ko party virdohi bataakar unke khilaaf kaaryakartaaon main kaaphi vish-vaman kiya gaya
 You tell me, should we have kept quiet on such an issue? 5
 avam naamak sanghathan banane ke aarope main jab party ke kaaryakarta karan singh ko dilli ikai ne nishkashit kiya, to karan singh ne is nirnay ke viruddh rashtriya anushaasan samiti ke saamne apil kii, jiske adhyaksh prashanth bhushan hai
 One evidence of anti-party activities against Karan Singh was that he gave party volunteers a s
s
 em
 Had sent a call to join the BJP
 karan singh kii daleel thi ki yah es
 m es farji he, jise ki party padaadhikariyon ne use badnaam karne ke liye bhijwaya tha
 Prashant Bhushan, being the chairman of the disciplinary committee, insisted on a rigorous inquiry into the matter, but party officials kept on trolling
 antat karan singh ke anurodh par police ne jaanch kii or es
 M
 es vaaki farzi paaya gaya
 It turned out that this s
 em
 a volunteer named S
 Deepak Chaudhary sent
 jaanch ko nishpaksh tareeke se karwaane kii vajah se ulte prashanth bhushan par awam kii tarafdaari kaa aarope lagaaya gaya
 There is no doubt that later the Awam was involved in many anti-party activities, but tell me, if a worker appeals to the Disciplinary Committee, should he have a fair hearing or not? 6
 jab dilli chunaav main ummidavaaron kaa chayan hone laga tab ham donon ke paas party kaaryakarta kuch ummidavaaron kii gambhir shikaayat lekar aane lage
 The complaint was that under pressure to win the election, tickets were being given to people who had serious allegations against them, whose character was not different from the leaders of the other parties
 shikaayat yah bhi thi kii puraane walantier ko darkinar kiya ja rahaa tha or tikat ke bare main sthaneey kaaryakartaaon kii baithak main dhaandhlee ho rahi thi
 In such a situation, both of us urged that complete information about all the candidates was first p
 e
 c and then be given to the public, such candidates should be thoroughly investigated and the final decision p
 e
 To be taken after due discussion in C, as written in our Constitution
 kya aisa kahana hamaara farz nahin tha? aise main hamaare aagrah kaa sammaan karne kii bajaay hampar chunaav main adnga daalane kaa aarope lagaaya gaya
 Ultimately our persistent request led to a committee to investigate complaints about the candidates
 phir baarah ummidavaaron kii lokapal dwaara jaanch hui, do ke tikat radd hue, chaar ko nirdosh paaya gaya or baaki chah ko shart sahit namakan daakhil karne diya gaya
 You tell me, would you call it an attempt to preserve the dignity and prestige of the party or an anti-party activity? Repeatedly raised the principles of Swaraj about which our party was formed
 hamane in sawaalon ko party kii charadivari ke bheetar or upyukt manch par uthaaya
 There is no loss to the party in all of this, that is why we waited till the Delhi elections are over and made some proposals through a note at the national executive meeting on 26 February
 hamaare mukhya prastaav ye the-1
 To safeguard the moral values in the party, there should be a review, which will examine in depth the cases like two crore checks and the allegations of liquor by our candidate so that our party's response to such serious allegations does not look like other parties
 2
 The political decisions of the states, at least the local body elections, should be taken by the state unit itself

 3

 4
 party ke nirnyon main walantirs kii awaz sunne or uskaa sammaan karne kii paryaapt vyavastha ho
 We raised these institutional issues and in return we got fabricated allegations
 hamane party kii ekta or uski aatma donon ko bachaane kaa har sambhav prayaas kiya or ham hi par party ko nuksaan panhuchane kaa aarope laga
 The allegation was that both of us were conspiring to defeat the party, that we were propagating against the party, that we were conspiring to take the position of convener
 aarope itane haasyaaspad hai ki inkaa jawaab dene kii ichha bhi nahin hoti
 It also seems that by answering them somewhere, they will not get dignity
 phir bhi, kyunki inhen baar-baar doharaaya gaya he isliye kuch tathyon kii safai kar dena upyogi rahegaa taaki aapke ke man main andeh kii gunjaaish naa bache
 (the letter does not become long, so we are not giving evidence here
 kuch dastavej yogendra kii fasebuk https: / / www
 facebook
 com / aapyogendra par uplabdh hai)ek aarope yah tha kii prashanth bhushan ne dilli chunaav main party ko harwane kii koshish kii
 Prashant Bhushan was very upset about the truth about the selection of candidates in Delhi elections
 prashanth katai nahin chaahate the kii party apane usulon ke saath samjhauta karke chunaav jite
 He said that winning the election on the wrong path would eventually ruin and end the party
 usase behatar ye hoga ki party apane siddhanton par tiki rahe, chaahe use alpamat main rahanaa pade
 He also feared that if the party came down to two or three seats with a majority, it could be a victim of manipulation, some suspicious candidates of the party might try to blackmail the party
 aisi bhavanaaen vyakt karnaa or party ko haraane kii dua yaa koshish karnaa, ye do bilkul alag-alag baaten hai
 How Yogendra damaged the party has not been disclosed in the allegation
 jaisaa ki har koi jaanata he, is chunaav main yogendra ne 80 se 100 ke bich jansabhaayen kin, har rose media ko sambodhit kiya, chunavi survey kiye or bhavishyavaanee kii or kaaryakartaaon ko phone or google hangout kiye
 Another allegation is that Prashant Bhushan threatened to hold press conferences against the party
 sach yah he ki ummidavaaron ke chayan se khinn prashanth ne kaha tha ki yadi party ummidavaaron ke charitra ke jaanch kii santoshjanak vyavastha nahin karti he to unhen majabuuran is maamle ko saarvajanik karnaa padegaa
 As such, fifteen senior party colleagues including Yogendra Yadav held a three-day meeting at Prashant's house
 faisla hua ki sandehgrast ummidavaaron kii lokapal dwaara jaanch kii jaayegi or lokapal kaa nirnay antim hoga
 This happened and when the decision of Lokpal came, we both accepted it completely
 party ko to fakhr hona chahie ki desh main pehali baar kisi party ne ek swatantra vyavastha bana kar apane ummidavaaron kii jaanch kii
 Another allegation is that Yogendra informed "the Hindu" newspaper at a breakfast meeting with journalists in Chandigarh that the decision of the National Executive was not respected while deciding Haryana elections
 yah aarope ek mahila patrkaar ne telephone vaarta main lagaaya, jise gupt rup se record bhi kiya gaya
 But after this statement was made public, another senior journalist present in the same meeting, Shri SP Singh, wrote an article and revealed that Yogendra had not told any such thing in that meeting
 unhone poocha he ki agar aisi koi bhi baat bataai hoti, to baaki ke teen patrkaar jo us naashte par maujuud the unhone yah khabar kyon nahin chhaapi? unke lekh kaa link http: / / www
 caravanmagazine
 in / vantage / indian-express-yogendra-yadav-indian-journalism he
 It is also alleged that during the Delhi elections, Yogendra told some other editors anti-party
 yadi aisa he to un sampadakon ke naam saarvajanik kyon nahin kiye jate?phir ek aarope yah bhi he ki prashanth or yogendra ne awam group ko samarthan diya
 It has been said above that Prashant, as the chairman of the disciplinary committee, urged a fair inquiry in the case of Karan Singh of Awam
 ek jaj ke kaam ko anushaasanheenata kaise kaha ja saktaa he? yogendra ke khilaaf is vishay main koi pramaan pesh nahin kiya gaya
 On the contrary, the people of Awam wrote to Yogendra by writing an email to which Yogendra publicly responded
 jab awam ne chunaav se ek haftaa pehle party par jhuthe aarope lagaaye to in aaropon ke khandan main sabase aham bhoomika yogendra ne nibhaai
 However, since these allegations have been made, they must be investigated
 party kaa vidhaan kahata he ki rashtriya kaaryakarini ke sadasyon ke khilaaf kisi bhi aarope kii jaanch party ke rashtriya lokapal kar sakate hai
 Lokpal himself has written a letter saying that he is ready to do any such investigation
 ham donon lokapal se anurodh kar rahe hai ki ve in chaaron saathiyon ke aaropon kii jaanch karen
 If the Lokpal finds us guilty, we will accept any punishment set by him
 lekin hamen yah samaj nahin aata ki party vidhaan ke tahat jaanch karwaane kii bajaay ye aarope media main kyon lagaaye ja rahe hai?saathiyon, yah ghadi party ke liye ek sankat bhi he or ek avasar bhi
 After such a big win, this is an opportunity to do some big things with a big heart
 yah chote chote vivaadon or tu-tu main-main main ulajhane kaa vaqt nahin he
 The dispute over the last few days has benefited some vested interests and caused damage to the party
 usase ubarne kaa yahi tarika he ki saare tathy sabhi kaaryakartaaon ke saamne rakh die jaaen
 This party is made up of the blood and sweat of the workers
 antat aap walantier hi ye tay karenge ki kya sach he kya jhooth
 We all walked in politics with the dream of truth and honesty
 aap hi faisla kijiye ki kya hamane sachai, sadachaar or swaraj ke aadarshon ke saath kahin samjhauta kiya? aapkaa faisla hamaare sar-maathe par hoga
 We are giving this letter to the media to reach you all
 hamaari ummid he ki party alpamat kaa sammaan karte hue is chitthee ko bhi usee tarah prasaarit karegi jaise kal anya chaar saathiyon ke bayaan ko prasaarit kiya tha
 But we do not want to escalate this controversy going on in the media
 ham nahin chaahate ki media main party kii chhichhaledar ho
 So after releasing this letter, we want to remain silent for the time being
 ham apil karte hai ki party ke sabhi saathi agle kuch din is maamle main maun rakhen taaki jakhm bharne kaa mauka mili, kuch sarthak sochane kaa avkaash mili
 Friends, Arvind Bhai is in Bangalore for health benefits
 sabaki tarah hamen bhi unke swasthy kii chintaa he
 Today, Arvind Bhai is not only the undisputed leader of the party, but also the symbol of clean politics in the country
 party ke sabhi kaaryakarta chaahate hai kii ve puri tarah swasth hokar dilli or desh ke prati apni jimmevaariyon ko nibhaa saken
 We are confident that Arvind Bhai will come back to the party to find a solution to this deadlock so that both the unity and soul of the party remain
 ham donon aap sab ko vishwaas dilaanaa chaahate hai ki ham siddhanton se samjhauta kiye bina party ko bachane kii kisi bhi koshish main har sambhav sahyog denge, hamane ab tak apni taraf se bich bachaav kii har koshish kii he, or aisi har koshish kaa swaagat kiya he
 Whatever it is, we will not allow the ahem to come in the way
 ham donon kisi pad par rahe yaa naa rahe ye mudda hi nahin he
 Just the party remained attached to its principles and the dreams of millions of workers, this is the only issue
 ham donon party anushaasan ke bheetar rahakar party ke liye kaam karte rahenge
 Your Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav maharashtra main jalgaanv se takreeban 10 kilometre dur bhadali gaanv main ek hi parivaar ke chaar logon kii hatya kar di gai
 Sharp weapons and hammers or stones are estimated to have been used in the murder
 marane waalon main pati - patni or unke do bachche hai
 The special thing is that the family had recently planned to sell their land and start a hotel
 hotel kaa udghaatan hone ke thik ek din pehle raat main un sabaki hatya kar di gai
 The area's SP Jalinder Supekar told NDTV that a total of five teams have been formed to nab the accused and all will be nabbed soon

 Police suspect that property disputes may also be a reason
 ilaake ke espi jalinder supekar ne enditivi ko bataaya ki aropiyon ko pakadaney ke liye kul paanch timen banaai gai hai or jald hi sabhi ko pakad liya jayega
 But he refused to divulge anything on what could have led to the murder
 tippaniyan According to the police, the financial condition of Pradip Bhole, who lives in Bhadli, was not very good
 kuch din pehle hi unhone apni ek jameen takreeban paanch lakh rupee main bechi thi or us paise se ek chota hotel banaaya tha
 The hotel was scheduled to be inaugurated on Monday 20 March

 On August 25, the day of the twelfth session, Virbhadra Singh told Prem Kumar Dhumal, "I will not come in these elections but wish you all the best
" " party kii ore se mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa ghoshit karne main deree se apamaanit mahasoos kar rahe virbhadra singh ne tab bhaajapa ke purv mukhyamantri se kaha tha ki ''agle vidhansabha main mere hone kii ummid nahin he

 The BJP made a strong comeback by winning 44 seats out of the total 68 seats in the state, while the Congress had to settle for only 21 seats
 bhaajapa kii shandaar jeet kii ummid to lagbhag sabhi kar rahe the or pehali baar eczit pole vaale bhi kuch sahi sabit hue
 But the victory was overshadowed by the defeat of the leader whom the party's national president Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised to make as chief minister
 shah ne rajgad kii chunavi sabha main ghoshnaa kii thi, ''dhumal ji purv mukhyamantri or vipaksh ke netaa rahe hai lekin 18 disambar ke baad ve phir aapke mukhyamantri honge
 "this late announcement was made just 9 days before polling but this announcement made BJP supporters happy and they started shouting slogans," Jai Shri Ram to Modiji, Jai Shri Ram to Dhumal Ji
 "bhaajapa ke andar yah baat sweekaar kii ja rahi he ki dhumal kii haar unke apane hi shishy rah chuke rajinder rana ke haathon hona usee tarah tay thi, jis tarah bhaajapa kii jeet tay maani ja rahi thi
 Traditionally, the Chief Minister was completely preoccupied with Hamirpur leaving its secure stronghold before he had to contest elections from Sujanpur
 sujanpur seat se bhaajapa aaj tak kabhi bhi nahin jeet pai
 This was an unfamiliar area for Dhumal, he had to face a grassroots mass leader like Rajinder Rana, who won here as an independent candidate in 2012 and this time was a Congress candidate
 kuch rajnatik jaankaron kaa to yahaan tak maananaa he ki bhaajapa jis tarah se mukhyamantri ke chehre kii ghoshnaa karne main anakani kar rahi thi or kai anya naamon par charchaa chal rahi thi, jinamein mukhya rup se kendriya swasthya mantri jagat prasad nadda kaa naam liya ja rahaa tha, usase to yahi lagata he ki bahut soche-samajhe tareeke se dhumal kii rajnatik hatya kii gai he
 However, this speculation seems far-fetched
 lekin itnaa to spasht he ki kai duusare netaa mukhyamantri pad kii daud main shaamil the
 On November 29, two days before Amit Shah announced Dhumal's name, Nadda said in a conversation with India Today, "the public has to decide (who she wants to be the chief minister)
" "chunaav najadik aane ke samay himachal main bhaajapa ke sarvaadhik lokapriy netaa maane jane vaale dhumal ke naam kii ghoshnaa se party main nai jaan aa gai thi
 This brought excitement among the BJP workers, while the voters also came to know who would be the leader

 Not only this, Navjot Sidhu, a former cricketer who drew a crowd and a minister in Punjab, was not even asked! Just think about this: Virbhadra Singh went to his new constituency Araki for filing papers only one day

 aarthik survey main likhaa he ki shahari vikaas mantralay kii ek hailavel cameti ne hisaab lagaaya he ki agle 20 saal main shahari dhaanche ko behatar karne ke liye 39 lakh karod kii zarurat hogi
 This calculation is based on 2009-10 prices
 pani, bijli, sadak or parivahan par itane kharch ke baad inke rakrakhaav or sanchaalan ke liye alag se 20 lakh karod kii or zarurat hogi
 The 14th Finance Commission has made a provision of giving 87,000 crores for 2015 to 20 to all the municipalities and corporations of the country
 zarurat ke hisaab se yah raashi kuch bhi nahin he magar pichhali sarkaron se tulana karen to 227 pratishat adhik di gai he
 The bulk of this will have to be mobilized by the local bodies at their own level
 aarthik survey se pataa chalata he ki kanpur or lakhanu main 50 fisadi rajasav sampatti kar se aata he
 Kolkata Municipal Corporation lags behind Kanpur and Lucknow in this case
 bhopal or ranchi ke rajasav main sampatti kar kii bhagidaari 15 fisadi se bhi kam he
 In Jaipur and Bangalore, only 5 to 20 per cent of the taxable property is taxed
 36 shahar 4400 karod kaa sampatti kar vasuulate hai jise agar wo chahen to badhaakar 22,000 karod kiya ja saktaa he
 This means that if the municipalities or corporations run in a professional manner and the scope of corruption is less, then they will have more money for the convenience of common citizens
 aarthik survey main bataaya gaya he jin nagarpalikaon ne zyada rajasav vasule hai unhone behatar suvidhaayen bhi di hai
 Now look at another figure
 mumbai main ek lakh kii aabaadi par 895 karmchaaree hai
 Delhi has 1260 employees on a population of one lakh
 neuyork main ek lakh kii aabaadi par 5,338 karmchaaree hai
 London has 2,961 employees at a population of one million
 isse yah pataa chalata he ki jab tak rajasav nahin hoga, karmchaaree nahin honge, nagarikon ko buniyadi suvidhaayen nahin milengi or unka rakrakhaav thik nahin hoga
 The condition of employees of most municipalities is not good
 samay se vetan nahin miltaa he or theke par kaam karne waalon ko bina hadtaal ke wo bhi nahin miltaa he
 Why this aspect has not been given prominence in the economic survey is not understood
 tamaam akhabaaron main mumbai kii samasyaon par chhapi khabaron se aapke liye kuch suchi banaai he
 The Midday newspaper has written that 1200 auto taxi stands have disappeared from Mumbai

 i am putting some part of it here

 If there is no water in the tap, whom will you call? zaahir he parshad ko hi phone karenge
 The councilor of your area will call the bmc's local engineer as to why the water is not coming
 50 se 60 pratishat aabaadi slam main rahati he
 To catch the local you go to catch the bus of the best but the bus arrives quite late and is also full
 sthaneey parshad hi biemasi main dabaav banayega ki aapke ilaake main bas kii zarurat he
 4 million people travel with the best buses

 The same will apply before the committee of the municipality and will pressurize it to pass the proposal

 It is possible that many educated people do not know what they should vote for the councilor

 mumbai mirar kii tanvi deshpandey ne ek acchhee report banaai he ki hamen parshad kyon chahie
 Tanvi Deshpande has made this list according to your busy time between six in the morning and nine in the night, when you will need a councilor and how a better councilor can improve the atmosphere from your home to office
 main uskaa kuch hissaa yahaan rakh rahaa hum
 BMC is responsible for water supply
 nalke main pani nahin aayaa to aap kise phone karenge
 Obviously, we will call the councilor
 aapke ilaake kaa parshad hi biemasi ke sthaneey ejeeniyar ko phone karegaa ki pani kyon nahin aa rahaa he
 50 to 60 percent of the population lives in slums
 local pakadan ke liye aap best kii bas pakadaney jate hai magar bas kaaphi der se aati he or bhari hui bhi hoti he
 The local councilor will put pressure on the BMC that a bus is needed in your area
 40 lakh log best kii bason se safar karte hai
 If there is an encroachment on the pavement, then by taking a picture, you can send it to the councilor to improve
 agar aapako lagata he ki kisi imaarat main fire sefti ke niyamon kaa paalan nahin hua he to aapke kehane par parshad us imaarat kii jaanch karvaa saktaa he
 If the road in your area is bad then it is the responsibility of the councilor to arrange for a good road
 vahi nagarpalika kii cameti ke saamne arji degaa or prastaav paas karaane kaa dabaav banayega
 It was a good newspaper effort
 mumkin he bahut se padhe likhe logon ko pataa hi na ho ki ve kis liye parshad ko vot karen
 But they will be troubled by the troubled Mumbai in the coming days, so why not vote again
 akhbaar kaa yah prayaas acha laga
 It is possible that many educated people do not know what they should vote for the councilor
 magar aae din pareshaan mumbai se ve bhi pareshaan rahete honge to phir vot kyon nahin dete hai

 No criminal will be punished, nor will any trial be completed
 aap jo kah rahe hai, uskaa matlab yah he ki apradhi ko sir maathe par baithaana chahie or uskaa sammaan karnaa chahie

 Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal was in his full color, shoring up the muffler that had become his identity for the shining Basanti turban during the Maghi fair on 14 January in Muktsar, Punjab
 "I want to say to the clouds" i am so that your tauji, sitting above, could not scare me, then what is the value of these clouds! ”if it is to be guessed from the applause of the ever increasing crowd, it was clear that She was liking it
 in tarifon se (jo shiromani akali dal or congress kii bulaai gai samanaantar reliyon kii tulana main kahin joardaar thim) utsahit hokar aam aadmi party ke rashtriya sanyojak ne punjab ke sattarudh kheme par khulaa hamalaa bol diya
 Neither did he respect the Badal family nor spared PM Modi nor the re-election of Punjab Congress Captain Amarinder Singh
 bheed taaliyon kii gadgadahat se unka swaagat kar rahi thi or jis vajah se kejariwal ko bich-bich main ruknaa bhi pad rahaa tha
 The interior of Punjab is known for shaking political waves such as the "charisma of Modi" of 2014
 is baar phir se vahaan khaasi chatapataahat he
 Just a year before the state's 15th assembly elections in early 2017, the people of Punjab are really weighing its prospects with seriousness, calling Dalit farmer Rampal "teeja Panth" of Balad Kalan village in Sangrur
 aap ne punjab kii 13 loksabhaa siton main se chaar-patiala, sangrur, fatehgarh sahib or faridakot jitkar zyaadaatar chunavi panditon or yahaan tak ki khud apane netaaon ko bhi chaunkaa diya tha
 Now it is ready to bring the political atmosphere of the province to turmoil again
 usne pichley saal rajdhani dilli main apni baari jeet ke turant baad hi rajya ke liye apane abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kar di thi or muktsar kii raily kaa najaara darasal usase pehle aath maheene kii tabadatod taiyaari kaa nateeja tha
 The victory of four seats in the Lok Sabha elections held in May 2014 was purely a result of the atmosphere that AAP had as a part of Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement and won 28 seats in the Delhi Assembly elections in December 2013
 Successfully stood in his favor
 aap netaa maanate hai ki party ke paas punjab main jamini str par lagbhag koi santhnik dhaancha nahin tha
 AAP national spokesperson and observer for Punjab, 43-year-old Sanjay Singh, says, “the biggest challenge for us was to create the organization at the lowest level in Punjab
 ”use bade hi kaabil tareeke se samanvit kiya elahabaad ke 27 varshiya yuva durgesh pathak ne, jinhone iees afasar banane ke apane sapane ko chhodkar 2013 main party kii sadsyta lee thi (or dilli kii un sabhi 35 siton par jeet bhi hasil kii jinaki jimmedaari unhen saunpi gai thi)
 In a short span of time, AAP has created such an organizational structure in Punjab which can also defeat mainstream political parties like Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Congress
 jab aap ne varisht sansthaapak sadasyon yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan ke saath-saath punjab ke apane saansadon main se do-dharminder gandhi or ech
 s
 khalsa or acchhee sankhya main deshbhar ke party kaaryakartaaon ko khud se alag karne kaa faisla kiya, to is sankat kii sthiti main party ne punjab ikai main baghawat ke sanketon ko kam se kam taatkaalik taur par to dabaa hi diya
 Sharing responsibilities, he made the party's most popular face in Punjab, Bhagwant Mann, MP from Sangrur, the head of the election campaign committee and made Sucha Singh Chhotepur, formerly associated with the pro-khalistan Akali dal-amritsar, the state convenor
 kuch-kuch aresas kii style main kaam karte hue uske baad aap ne 13 sansadeey jone kaayam kiye, jinamein se harek kaa netritv sanyukt rup se dilli se ek prabharee or ek sthaneey samanvayak ko diya gaya
 Each zone is divided into nine sectors according to the assembly segments and then each sector into a cluster or cluster of 20-20 polling booths
 or thik bijepi ke matra-sanghathan kii hi tarah har booth ke liye pehle hi ek prabharee kaaryakarta niyukt he
 Punjab party spokesperson Himmat Shergill says, “about ten thousand Punjabis participated as activists in the AAP campaign in Delhi
 ab lautakar un sabhi ke paas hamaari party ke bare main antaheen kathaayen hai ki ham kin muddon ke liye khadey hai
 "now let's look at a hallmark: Pathak claims that the party membership in Punjab is '24 lakh', of which 14 lakh are those who have themselves signed and filled the forms and 10 lakh are those who have added the mobile phone application 'punjab Add'" Visited and subscribed
 isse pehle may-june 2015 ke dauraan beyimaan bhagaao, punjab bachaao kaa naaraa dekar kai jagah par road-sho kiye gaye or phir sitambar main punjab ke sabhi 117 vidhansabha kshetron main matadaataaon tak pahunch banaate hue 32 jansabhaayen yojit kii gayi
 Your campaign in October was also absolutely marque
 pehle to usne milavati kitnashkon kii aapurti kii vajah se kapaas kii fasalon ko hue nuksaan ke liye muaavje kii maang ko lekar kisaanon or khetihar shramikon ke behad kaamyaab andolan kaa hissaa khud ko banaaya
 Then he also associated himself immensely with the Sikhs who were opposing some incidents of insult to the Guru Granth Sahib
 saaf tha ki maukey ko bhaanpate hue kejariwal ne kotkapura ke behal kalam gaanv ke baahar police firing main maare gaye do sikh pradarshnakariyon ke pariwaron se bhi jaakar mulaakaat kii
 Keeping this atmosphere intact, on December 6, a large squad of aap's youth unit made an arrest outside Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal's government residence
 ve logon kaa dhyaan uski ore kheenchna chaahate the jise shergill “bharat kaa sabase bada pastisids ghotaalaa” bataate hai jisamen unke anusaar sarkaar ke mantri or rajya ke kai adhikari shaamil hai
 While there is no way to substantiate this, AAP leaders claim that people from each of the more than 12,000 villages of Punjab attended the rally on 14 January in Muktsar
 ek or daawa jisaki pushti rajya main ghoomane vaala koi bhi kar saktaa he, vah yah ki punjab ke har shahar, kasbe or gaanv main kejariwal or aap ke anya netaaon-maan, chhotepur, sadhu singh or shergill- kii tasveeron vaale poster mil jaaenge
 For example, in Lahra Gagga (sangrur), the constituency of former Congress Chief Minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, no real discussion is complete without AAP
 aatmahatya karne vaale kisaanon ke bacchon ko praathamikta ke aadhaar par padhaane vaale ek chote se nijee skool ko chalaane vaale kanwaljeet dhindsa kehete hai, “maine aisa kuch ghatate pehle kabhi nahin dekha
 You are pulling people who want to do something for the party, not those who are only looking for easy opportunities
 ” ve aise kai logon or guton kaa udhaaharan dete hai jinhone artiai or shiksha kaa adhikaar kanoon ke tahat saarvajanik camp lagane kii peshkash kii he
 Interestingly, the ruling Shiromani Akali dal-bjp alliance and the Congress re-energized by the appointment of Amarinder Singh as head, both are a bit shocked by the support received by Kejriwal at the Maghi fair
 donon hi kheme maan rahe hai ki aap unke liye badi chunauti he or ve isliye apane bhaashanon main zyaadaatar samay “topiwalon” ko khari-khoti sunaane main lagaate hai
 Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal and his father made fun of Kejriwal by saying that he did not even know the difference between the different crops that grow in Punjab
 ve logon se kah rahe hai ki anna hajaare ko dhokhaa dene vaale is gaddaar ko khaarij kar den
 Seeing the SAD-BJP alliance being suppressed under the anti-incumbency wave of his ten-year rule, Amarinder Singh says, "in 2017, there will be a direct contest between Congress and AAP
 ” yah badal parivaar ko kinare karne kii congress kii ranneeti he, aap ke ubhaar ko dekhte hue amarinder ke yah shabd sach sabit ho sakate hai
 So has your path become easier in Punjab already? Despite the generally known tendency of Punjabis to try new things, analysts believe that the situation may change in the coming 12 months
 aap ne to pehle hi apana haath dikhaa diya he or jaisaa ki sanjay singh kehete hai, “use ab janchetana main apni dirghakaalin pahchaan or maujuudagi kaayam karne par dhyaan kendrit karnaa chahie
 “the people of Punjab have fond memories of the five-year tenure of the Congress under the leadership of Captain Amarinder Singh
 unhen ve akele aise netaa ke taur par maanate hai jo badal parivaar ke aadhipaty ko chunauti de saktaa he
 He is the only one who can dare to disobey the instructions of the central high command of his own party as he did in the case of the repeal of the inter-state Water Treaty in 2005
 phir manpreet badal kaa haal hi main congress main shaamil hona bhi congress kii sthiti ko thodaa or majboot kar saktaa he
 In the end, many people still hesitate to see the miracle that Sukhbir Badal had done in February 2012 to win a second consecutive election
 sukhbir damdaar pratidwandvi hai or 2012 ne unhen sikhaa diya he ki nitant naammumkin sthitiyon main bhi jeetna mumkin he
 a few months ago, a lamp manufacturing company was trying to market new high-tech products

 After the PAC, Aam Aadmi Party Prashant Bhushan and Jogendra Yadav are now preparing to be removed from the National Executive
 iske saath hi party ab khule taur par yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan ko gaddaar bataa rahi he
 The party has issued a complete statement accusing both of them that they were trying to defeat the party

 The Aam Aadmi Party issued a statement saying, 'the party did not make public the reasons for the removal of Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav from the PAC, thinking that it would adversely affect the personality of both of them, but after the meeting, by giving constant statements in the media, the atmosphere It is being made, as if the national executive took this decision in an undemocratic and irresponsible manner

 These three leaders are Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav and Shanti Bhushan
 'aam aadmi party ne yogendra-prashanth par party ko haraane kii koshishon ke kuch udhaaharan bhi die hai
 1
 inhone, khaskar prashanth bhushan ne, duusare pradeshon ke kaaryakartaaon ko phone karke dilli main chunaav prachaar karne aane se roka

 ' is baat kii pushti anjali damania bhi kar chuki hai ki unke saamne prashanth ne mysore ke kaaryakartaaon ko aisa kaha
 2
 jo log party ko chanda dena chaahate the, prashanth ne un logon ko bhi chanda dene se roka
 3

 unhen pataa tha ki aam aadmi party or bijepi ke bich kaante kii takkar he
 And if only a senior leader of any party speaks against the party, then the winning bet will also turn into defeat
 5

 aise vaqt jab hamaare netaaon ko prachaar karnaa chahie tha, wo log in teenon ko manaane main lage hue the
 6
 duusari taraf party ke paas tamaam saboot hai, jo dikhaate he ki kaise arvind kii chhavi ko kharaab karne ke liye yogendra yadav ne akhabaaron main negative khabaren chhapavai
 The biggest example of this is the news published in The Hindu newspaper in August 2014, which presented a negative picture of Arvind and the party
 jis patrkaar ne ye khabar chhaapi thi, usne pichley dinon iskaa khulaasa kiya ki kaise yadav ne ye khabar plant kii thi
 Some more prominent editors have also told in private conversations that Yadav used to meet him during the Delhi elections and used to say off the record to tarnish Arvind's image
