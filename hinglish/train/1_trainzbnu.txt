 flixi fere system lagu karne baad lagaataar aalochana kaa saamana kar rahe railway board ne apane kadam ko tarksangat bataate hue kaha ki is system ke baavjood railway se safar karnaa yatriyon ke liye bahut mahangaa nahin he
 According to the Railway Board, despite the flexi fare system implemented two days ago in Rajdhani, Duronto and Shatabdi Express trains, railways are still a cheaper transport service than rail, road and air traffic
 'vimaan or baso ke kiraye se kam fere'yatriyon kii naaraazgi or raajnneetik dabaav ke bicharelveboard ke member trephic mohammad jamshed ne ravivaar hone ke baavjood rail bhawan main apane adhikariyon ke saath samvaadadaata sammelan kii script taiyaar kar rahe the
 At the press conference convened on Sunday afternoon, Mohammad Jamshed came with full preparation and with a power point presentation, he tried to tell the country how the increased fares of the railways are needed
 unhone bataaya ki dilli se jaipur, chandigarh, chennai se bangaleru or mysore tak shatabdi express or dilli se tiruvanantpuram, patna or mumbai ke bich rajdhani express ke asi tu shrenee kaa flixi kiraaya vimaan ke kiraye se kam he
 The fare of Shatabdi Express is also less than the fare of Volvo buses
 railway kii kamai main hoga ijafounhone bataaya flixi fere system lagu hone ke baad 9 or 10 sitambar ko tikat booking hui he
 21000 and 29000 tickets were booked in Shatabdi, Rajdhani and Duronto on 9 and 10 respectively, while 2700 and 3000 passengers respectively paid the maximum fare under the Flexi Fair system on both days
 unhone bataaya ki 9 or 10 sitambar ko ausatan 80 lakh rupee pratidin kii kamai badi he
 In this way, Railways will have an additional income of about 1000 crores in the next one year
 unhone yah bhi spasht kiya ki flixi kiraaya pranali main bhi yatriyon ko riyaayaton kaa laabh pehle jaise hi usee anupaat main miltaa rahegaa
 Senior citizens, men, women, sportspersons and patients etc
 will continue to get pre-fixed percentage discount
 member trephic mohammad jamshed ne kaha ki flixi fere system se aam aadmi par koi asar nahin padegaa
 According to him, out of around 3200 Mail Express trains running every day, only 144 (44 Rajdhani, 54 Durant and 46 Shatabdi Express) have been brought under the Flexi Fair system
 in trainon main pratidin kareeb dedh lakh yatri safar karte hai
 This number is less than 10 percent of the total reserved passengers
 unhone flixi kiraaya pranali ko dynamik vimaan kiraaya pranali se behatar bataate hue kaha ki isamen logon ko pataa hota he ki kiraaya kis seemaa tak bad saktaa he or kab kitna kiraaya hoga
 This has nothing to do with increasing demand, there are only limits on booking of seats, on the same basis the fare increases
 'railway de rahi behatar suvidhaayen'mohammad jamshed ne bade hue kiraye ke evaj main milane vaali suvidhaon ke bare main puche gaye sawaal kaa jawaab dete hae kaha ki railway kuch samay se yatri suvidhaon ke liye kai kadam uthaa rahi he
 Railways is striving for better catering facility, wi-fi internet service
 iske alaava railway airlinon kii tarj par frequent traveler incentive dene kii yojana par kaam kar rahi he
 Asked about apprehensions that ticket agents would benefit from the halftaxi fare system and the possibility of passengers getting caught in the clutches of the agents, Mohammad Jamshed said that the railway is constantly vigilant to rein in the agents and take steps to stop it Raises
 agar pataa chalata he ki flixi kiraaya pranali ke kaaran aisi samasya or bad rahi he, to railway samuchit kadam uthaaegi

 narayansami ko 11 november ko jab bahusadasyeey mahalekha pareekshak or niyantrak (sieji) kaa nayaa vichaar kaundha, to yah saaf taur par vinod raay ko lekar upie sarkaar kii badhati hataasha kii taakid kar rahaa tha
 This also exposed the fear of the government that in the next few months, there may be some more shocking reports
 ye sambhavit report sarkaar kii saamaajik pariyojnaon, nitiyon or kaaryakramon se judi hai, jinhen 2008 main raay ke is pad par aane se pehle tak sieji ke daayre se baahar rakhaa gaya tha
 Rai reaffirmed the Charter citing his jurisdiction as written in the Charter of the Institute and took these into his purview as soon as he assumed office
 raay is baar bhi sarkaar ko aade haathon le sakate hai kyonki ve agle saal may main sevanivrutt hone ko lekar aashwast hai jab ve 65 saal ke ho jaaenge
 Since the CAG is a constitutional body, any tampering of its rules will require the approval of Parliament and any such amendment can be passed by a two-thirds majority of the House only when both the Houses have at least a minimum of the total members
 -less half are present and vote
 upie ke liye yah bada mushkil hoga
 The CAG report of the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Scheme (JNNURM) has already been sent to President Pranab Mukherjee and will be tabled in the winter session of Parliament
 iske alaava taiyaar reporton main manaregaa, 2008 kii kisaan karj maafee yojana kii samiksha or urvarak sabsidi kii report he
 a top CAG official said, "all these will put the government in trouble
" jeenenyuarem kii report to satr kii shuruyaat main hi rakhi jaaegi jabaki baaki teen aakhri dinon main rakhi jaaengi or bahut der hui to agle saal ke bajet satr tak inhen pesh kar hi diya jayega
 '' According to sources, one lakh crore rupees
 kii jeenenyuarem pariyojna ke audit main centre dwaara anudaan ke aavanton main gadbaditaan pai gai hai
 The CAG has found that the Center released funds to some states whose urban units did not meet the required guidelines
 yah paaya gaya ki kai maamalon main koi kaam hi nahin hua he jabaki centre apni bajtiy aavanton ko kharch karne main laga rahaa
 In some cases, the CAG has also claimed damages due to violation of the tender guidelines
 yah anudaan rajyon main shahari dhaanche main sudhaar sambandhi parionaon ke liye diya gaya tha
 The seven-year mission began in 2005-06 and ends in December 2012 with the 11th five-year Plan
 apni vistrut samiksha main sieji ne sarkaar ko kathghare main khadaa kiya he
 upa's one lakh crore rupees
 kii ek or yojana manaregaa bhi ladkadaa rahi he
 The CAG has found heavy corruption in the release of grants and serious irregularities at various levels and misuse of money, including in gram panchayats
 yah vidambnaa he ki tatkaaleen gramin vikaas mantri jairam ramesh ne is yojana kii sieji dwaara jaanch karwaae jane ko aktubar, 2011 main manjuuri de di kyonki sarkaar ne isse pehle sieji ke charter kaa hawala dete hue is par roak laga di thi
 The CAG has found irregularities in the implementation of MNREGA, irregularities in the name of fake workers, money grab, delay in payment, getting the work done without payment and irregular maintenance of records
 yah bhi paaya gaya he ki kai rajyon main ise lagu karwaane ke liye jimmedaar adhikariyon ne hi yojana ko hadap liya he or karadaataaon ke paise kii khuli bandarbaant hui he
 This report may increase the problems of the government
 sieji ne 65,000 karod ru
 The Kisan Debt Waiver Scheme has also found a serious flaw, which was supposed to be a scheme for the benefit of four crore farmers
 ek muyna report ke masaude main sieji ne sanket die hai ki iske labhaarthiyon ko bina kisi niyam ke chun liya gaya or ve kuchhek jagahon se hi chun liye gaye, or jinhen vastav main raahat chahie thi ve chhod die gaye
 Ajay Vir Jakhar, president of the Bharat Krishak Samaj, has observed the scheme closely
 unhone india today ko bataaya ki yah yojana puri tarah se gadabad thi
 Investigation of the loan given found that more than half of the beneficiaries were businessmen and others who owned their own agricultural land
 unke mutabik, 2009-10 ke dauraan adhiktar labhaarthi dilli or chandigarh se the na ki chhattisgarh, pashchim bengal, uttar pradesh, punjab yaa bihar se
 He also pointed out that governments were motivating public sector banks to give loans instead of encouraging cooperative banks
 yah pehali audit he jab sieji ne is maamle se jude bainkon kaa bahi-khaataa bhi jaancha he
 According to sources, the draft report talks about the mess related to identification of beneficiaries
 masauda report kahati he ki ‘‘ayogy kisaanon’’ ne ‘chote or seemaant’ shrenee ke yogya kisaanon kii keemat par baari laabh apni jeb main kar liye hai
 The CAG found that the farmers who repaid loans on time did not get any benefit while those whose loans were sinking for a long time got the benefit of loan waiver
 urvarkon kii sabsidi par bhi sieji kii report upie sarkaar ko sharminda kar sakati he
 The draft report says that between 2007-08 and 2009-10, the Department of Fertilizers paid Rs 50,000 crore as subsidy
 se zyada de die, jisamen fermon dwaara kiye gaye farji daavon kii satyata jaanch prakriya ko nahin apanaaya gaya
 Jakhar says that this policy itself is wrong
 unke mutabik, ‘‘sarkaar ko kisaanon kii mitti jaanchane par dhyaan dena chahie or phir unhen bataanaa chahie ki kisi fasal ugaani he or kis urvarak kaa istemaal karnaa he
 Instead, fertilizers are used arbitrarily without any calculation
 ’’ pichley kuch sansad satron main 2ji spectrum aavanton or koyala block aavanton par sieji kii report ne jis kadar hangaamaa barapa kiya he, usee tarj par sheetakaaleen satr ke or bajet satr bhi hangamakhez rahane ke asaar hai
 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is very angry with the ordinance brought in to amend the Land Acquisition Act
 mamata banerjee ne is adhyadesh ko 'kaala adhyadesh' qaraar dete hue kaha he ki centre sarkaar jo adhyadesh lekar ai he, usase logon kii jameen bandook kii nok par lee jaaegi or jab tak vah jinda hai tab tak kisi kii jameen is adhyadesh main bataae gaye tareekon se nahin lee ja sakegi
 Mamta said that through the new ordinance, land can be acquired from above her corpse
 saath hi mamata banerjee ne yah bhi kaha ki desh main modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad se halaat immergency ke daur se bhi badtar ho gaye hai or modi sarkaar loktantr ke khilaaf kaam kar rahi he

 He scored his first century in October 2009 against Australia and his second century in December 2009 against Sri Lanka

 That was the failure of the England batsmen, due to which India did not get the gift of the first defeat

 Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Sunday stressed that it is the responsibility of the Congress party to protect secularism
 saath hi unhone kaha ki hindi pattee main party ke sankat kaa samaadhaan ‘bahusankhyak tushtikaran’ main yaa ‘coke lite’ kii tarj par kisi tarah ke ‘lite hindutv’ kii peshkash main nahin he or is raah par chalane se ‘congress jiro’ ho jaaegi
 He alleged that the claim by the BJP and its allies to be Hindu is no different from the loyalty of 'rogue supporters of British football' to their team
 apni kitaab 'di hindu ve: en introdection tu hinduism' ke locarpan se pehle pitiai ko die ek intervyuu main tharur ne daawa kiya ki sattarudh logon dwaara jo prachaar kiya ja rahaa he wo sahi myanon main hindutv nahin he, balki vah ek mahaan mat ko ‘vikrut karnaa’ he, jise unhone vishuddh raajnneetik or chunavi laabh ke liye ek sankeern raajnneetik hathiyaar main badal diya he
 Tharoor said that as a cautious optimist, he would like to say that there are a large number of Indians who are committed to opposing the recent 'conservative trends' and will constantly ensure that 'distorted views on India' succeed
 Don't tharur ne kaha, ‘congress party ke sadsy ke rup main meraa maananaa he ki bharat main dharmanipekshata kii raksha karne main party kii ek buniyadi bhoomika he
 It is his duty to lead it
 ’unhone kaha, ‘jo log yah suzav de rahe hai ki hindi pattee main party ke sankat kaa samaadhaan bhaajapa kii tarah ‘bahusankhyak tushtikaran’ main he, ve ek badi galati kar rahe hai
 If the voter has the choice of choosing one between the real thing and his copy, he will choose the real one every time
 ’ tharur ne kaha ki bhaajapa kii safalataa se bhaybheet hone ke bajaay congress ke liye behatar hoga ki vah un siddhanton ke liye khadi ho, jin par usne hameshaa vishwaas kiya he or desh ko unke anusaran ke liye prerit kare
 The Congress leader said, 'the loyal people will respect a party that shows the courage of our beliefs, not offering some kind of' light Hindutva 'on the lines of' Coke Light 'and' Pepsi Zero ',' Light Hindutva 'will end only as' Zero Congress'
 ’ haal main hue loksabhaa chunaav main puri hindi pattee se congress party kaa safaya ho gaya
 After this, some people inside and outside the party suggested that the Congress needs to respond to the bjp's story of 'minority appeasement' and take a soft stance on its secular identity
 ‘coke lite’ or ‘pepsy jiro’ mul soft drink brands ke chini rahit or calories rahit sanskaran hai
 Tharoor said, 'the beauty of Hindutva is that we have no pope to make laws, no imam issues fatwa and tells what is true, there is no holy scripture alone
 hindu mat main aisi koi baat nahin he
 ' ek taraf bharat main raashtragan gane par bahes chhidi hui he

 This amendment states that the use of the national anthem as funerals, improper private occasions, adverts or in public places as background music would be inappropriate

 Remembering the 2001 tour, the Australian team, playing a 3-test series in India in 2001, was at its peak at the time
 vah lagaataar 15 test jeet kar ai thi or aate hi mumbai main bharat ko 10 wicket se rond kar 16waan test jeeta tha
 But in the second Test match played at Eden Gordon, Kolkata, India's team showed a tremendous game and despite follow-on, Team India beat the kangaroos
 bharat ne yah test 171 ranon se jeeta tha
 The second Test of Harbhajan, Dravid and Laxmandad will always be remembered for the hat-trick of Turbanator Harbhajan Singh taken in the first innings, this was the first hat-trick from any Indian in Test cricket
 hetric ke baavjood australiane 445 kaa bada score khadaa kiya or jawaab main bharat 171 par hi ludhak gaya

 trinmul congress ke saansad derek o bryan ne sadan main charchaa ke dauraan modi sarkaar par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 He said that the government has insulted Parliament
 derek o bryan ne kaha ki ek subah ek vyakti ko dilli main sapana aayaa ki samvidhan badalte hai to ye bill le aae
 Today, if you see the open poll of Lok Sabha, then NDA is stopping at 150-160, but this bill is a deception for young and poor people
 is dauraan unhone sarkaar par tikhaa hamalaa karte hue kaha ki ham koi gymkhana club, ahmedabad ke sadsy nahin hai jiskaa aap apmaan kar rahe hai
 The previous governments sent about 65 percent of the bills to the committees but this government (gymkhana Club) sent only 20 percent of the bills
 derek ke sarkaar ko gymkhana club bulaane par kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ne virodh jataayaa
 To which the TMC MP immediately said that he has come by checking, there should be no objection in the House with this word
 tiemasi saansad ne kaha ki sarkari aankadon ke anusaar abhi tak 32 rupee tak kamaane vaala garib tha, lekin is bill kii maane to 2100 rupee tak kamaane vaala garib mana jayega
 Today's youth is asking where are the jobs, then this government is teaching Pakodanomics
 unhone daawa kiya ki pashchim bengal main mamata banerjee kii sarkaar ne 2011 main hi kisaanon kii aay doguna karne kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin is sarkaar ne 2016 main aakar ye baat kahi
 He said that our government has so far tripled the income of the farmers of the state

 Targeting the government, the party's leader Naresh Gujral said, "the central government is not taking along its allies
 ' unhone kaha, 'modi sarkaar ko vaajapeyi sarkaar se sikh leni chahie
 Naresh Gujral has questioned the way the Modi government functions
 unhone kaha ki modi sarkaar ne bhoomi adhigrahan bill par apane saathi dalon kii ek baar bhi baithak nahin bulaai he
 Quoting the Vajpayee government, the Akali leader said that if the alliance was like the previous NDA era, there would be no problem today
 'gauratlab he ki isse pehle bijepi ke varisht netaa or purv kendriya mantri arun shouri ne narendra modi sarkaar koaarthik morche par felkaraar diya he
 He said, 'modi's economic policy is directionless
 unhen pariyojnaon kii bajaay nitiyon par zyada focus karnaa chahie
 Shourie said that there is a confusion about the tax system in the government
 sarkaar ke faislon se niveshak chhitak rahe hai
 He claimed that the government had failed to allay fears among minorities
 arun shouri ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya he ki narendra modi, amit shah or arun jetali kii tikdi hi sarkaar chalaa rahi he

 The monsoon session of Parliament is going to start on Wednesday and many important bills are pending in this session
 satr ke dauraan 40 bill to aise hai jinhen modi sarkaar 2014 main satta main aane ke turant baad lekar ai thi lekin abhi bhi unke sansad se paarit hone kaa intjaar he
 In the current environment, when the opposition is preparing to surround the government in the House on various issues, it is difficult to get these bills passed
 centre main sarkaar sanbhaalane ke baad endie sarkaar ne lambit bilon main se 12 bill bahumat vaale sadan loksabhaa main paarit kara liye hai lekin rajyasabha main abtak yah atake hi hue hai
 In view of the forthcoming elections, the monsoon session of Parliament is expected to be very rude
 pichley dinon puraabajet satr hangaameki bhent chadh gaya tha saath hi kaamkaaj ke lihaaj se 16veen loksabhaa kaa record kaaphi kharaab hi rahaa he
 Three divorce bill to be passed? In Parliament, this time the bill related to Lokpal, land acquisition, whistle blower protection, transgender rights, triple talaq, fugitive economic offender, river dispute brought by Modi government are pending
 inamen se sarkaar teen talaak or bhoomi adhigrahan bill ko pramukhataa se paarit karaane kii koshish main juty he
 a political struggle has also been spread across the country on this bill related to Muslim women
 sarkaar ke liye rajyasabha main lambit vidheyakon ko paarit karana kisi chunauti se kam nahin he
 The NDA has limited numbers here and there was a lot of uproar in the Upper House in the past
 ab sarkaar jald se jald bhoomi adhigrahan bill ko paarit karana chaahegi jise lekar sanyukt vipaksh lagaataar kadaa rukh apanaae hue he
 The BJP has suffered a setback due to Congress President Rahul Gandhi's 'suit-boot government' and may withdraw the proposed amendments to the bill by coming out of the image of being 'close to businessmen'
 ahm he naagarikta bilanaagarikta se judaa sansodhan bill bhi sarkaar kii top list main he
 The bill seeks to give citizenship to people living in India illegally as refugees
 hindu, sikh, buddha, jain, parsi or isai samudaay ke kai log padosi mulk afghanistan, bangladesh, pakistan se aakar bharat main sharnaarthi ke taur par bas gaye hai
 While the issue of Bangladeshi refugees is also important
 assam or pashchim bengal jaise rajyon main inhen bharat se nikaale jane kaa virodh bhi ho rahaa he
 In this case, the Opposition is accusing the BJP of imposing Hindutva agenda
 rashtriya pichhadaa varg ayog ko sanvaidhanik darja dene se judaa bill bhi is monsoon satr main lambit he
 Apart from this, all eyes are on the Muslim Women Protection Act, which makes triple talaq illegal
 yah bill loksabhaa se paarit ho chukaa he lekin rajyasabha main atka padaa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already said that the government is committed to protecting the rights of Muslim women
 lekin congress isamen saath dene ko taiyaar nahin he jaisaa ki shahbaano ke maamle se judaa congress kaa itihaas he
 The PM has even accused the Congress of being a party of Muslim men

 " The rapidly growing population in Pakistan is 'ticking time bomb'
 ye ham nahin kah rahe balki pakistan kii sabase badi adaalat yani supreme court ke chif justise ne kaha he
 Pakistan's highest court, the world's fifth-largest population, has warned that if the growing population is not controlled, Pakistan will be completely submerged under debt
 pakistan main philhal alam ye he ki yahaan paidaa hone vaala har baccha apane sir par dedh lakh lakh rupye kaa karj lekar paidaa hota he
 That is why in Pakistan too, the demand for two of us and our two has started picking up
 pakistani supreme court kii chetavanisupreme court ne kaha ki pakistan main paidaa hone vaala har baccha ‘tictac karata time bam’ he
 The Supreme Court has instructed to control the growing population
 saath hi mulk main badhati berojgaare ko dekhte hue aabaadi par ankush lagane kii hidaayat bhi di
 After this, the demand of two of us is also gaining momentum in Pakistan
 har navjaat deb lakh kaa karzdaarpuri duniya main jab bhi ye kilkaari goonjati he to chehre khushiyon se jhum uthte hai
 But Pakistan is the only country in the world where even this kilkari rings like a bell of danger
 jaanate hai kyon
 Because every child coming out of the mother's womb owes about one and a half lakh rupees as soon as it is born
 aankade kehete hai ki pakistani aabaadi ke 21 main se saat karod log garibi rekha se neeche hai
 That is, four out of every ten Pakistanis are poor
 us par sitam ye ki mulk par kareeb 30 hazaar arab kaa qarja he
 So now whenever a child is born here, understand that it is a 'ticking time bomb'
 aisa ham nahin kah rahe balki ye pakistani supreme court ke chif justise kaa kahana he

 We need to run a nationwide awareness movement
 ab samay aa gaya he ki jansankhya niyantran ke liye desh ekajute ho
 Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar lashed out at the country's Health Secretary, Captain Zahid Saeed, for not giving the progress report so much because Saeed had said that the Health Department can neither formulate nor implement population control measures
 
 court ne ab sambandhit vibhaag ko har teen maheene main progress report pesh karne kaa aadesh bhi diya he

 Chidambaram said on Saturday that in order to make the Rajiv Gandhi Equity Savings Scheme more attractive to investors, it will be improved in the coming budget
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki mantralay isamen diye jane vaale kar protsaahan upayon kii phir se samiksha karegaa or niveshkon kii chintaaon kaa niraakaran karne kaa prayaas karegaa
 Inaugurating the Rajiv Gandhi Equity Savings Scheme, he said, 'I have assured the regulator that we will make necessary changes in this scheme, taking advantage of the opportunity in the next Budget and the next Finance Bill
 yojana ko taiyaar karte samay jo anubhav hamen mila he uske anusaar ham isamen jaruri badlaav karenge or ise khudara niveshkon ke liye aakshark banaayenge
 Chidambaram admitted that some concerns had been raised about the plan
 aam niveshak ke lihaaj se yojana jatil he or use samajhane main kathinaayee ho rahi he
 Now it will be simplified and investors will not have difficulty in participating in it
 yojana kii ghoshnaa 2012-13 ke bajet main tatkaaleen vitt mantri pranab mukherjee ne kii thi
 The scheme was launched with a view to encourage new investors to invest in the capital market
 vitt mantri ne kaha, ‘kuch logon kahana he ki yojana main jis tarah ke protsaahan kii baat kii gai he use samajhnaa aam niveshkon kii samaj se baahar kii baat he
 Some say that giving a benefit of 50 percent reduction on investments up to Rs 50,000 is not an appropriate incentive
 ’ chidambaram ne kaha ki sarkaar ne rajeev gandhi equity bachat yojana main muchuval fund ko bhi shaamil hone kii anumati de di he
 It was initially kept for new investors only
 chidambaram ne ‘apane graahak ko jaaniye- kevaisi’ niyamon ke maamle main bhi ekikaran par jor diya
 He said, 'there cannot be separate KYC rules for business partners, intermediaries working under the same regulator
 isse bhi kharaab sthiti tab hogi jab vibhinn niamakon ke liye hamen kevaisi ke alag-alag set banane honge
 Due to this, the investors will get away from getting upset
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘yadi niveshak hi bazaar or nivesh kaarobaar se dur ho gayi to phir itane saare niamak or itane madhyast evam bhagidaaron kii kya aavashyaktaa he
 Our aim should ultimately be to attract investors
 yadi aap niveshkon se kai sawaal karenge to koun sa niveshak khaataa kholegaa or koun isamen bhagidaari karegaa, aise main to vah dur hoga
 Chidambaram wondered why if someone has a bank account, why can't he open a depository account directly
 ‘aap yadi khaataa kholane se pehle kai tarah kii jaanch padtaal main lage rahenge to mujhe isamen koi shankaa nahin ki das main se paanch sambhavit niveshak dur ho jaayenge
 He would say why waste his time
 ’ unhone kaha ki in kaaryon ko saral banane kii aavashyaktaa he
 'we have to assure investors that investing in financial products and investing in the capital market is better for the whole economy and the country and it is going to provide long term benefits for the investor
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki sarkaar chaahati he ki chote niveshak aage aayen or puunji bazaar main nivesh karen
 'we want to support the stock market for this so that small investors can be encouraged to invest in the market
 ’ rajeev gandhi equity bachat yojana ke tahat sheyaron main pehali baar nivesh karne vaale chote niveshak ko 50,000 rupee tak ke nivesh par 50 pratishat iskar main katautee kaa laabh milegaa
 This facility is for those earning less than Rs 10 lakh per annum
 adhikaron kii jang ke bich grih mantralay dilli police ayukta ko court main chal rahe maamalon main dilli sarkaar se manjuuri liye bina apil daayar karne or sarkari vakeelon kii niyukti karne kaa adhikaar dene par vichaar kar rahi he
 If this happens, some of the rights of the Delhi government will be taken away
 aadhikarik sutron ne bataaya kiagar aisa hua tohai court main chal rahe kisi maamle main apil daayar karne yaa na karne or sarkari vakil kii niyukti karne sambandhi faisle lene main dilli sarkaar kii bhoomika puri tarah samaapt ho jaaegi
 Interestingly, on 27 May, the Delhi government appointed eight advocates as additional permanent lawyers (criminal) in the Delhi High Court for prosecution, appeal or other proceedings
 ye aath adhivaktaa avanindra singh, kaamana vohara, rajesh mahajan, sanjay lao, ashish agarwal, richaa kapur, ranbir singh kundu or nandita raav hai
 The permission has to be taken from the Delhi government
 Currently, the Delhi Police has to file an appeal or if the government attorney is appointed, then he has to consult the Delhi government's home department
 grih vibhaag maamle kii gunvattta par vichaar karne ke baad yah nirnay karata he ki apil daayar kii jaani he yaa nahin or phir aage kii karrwai ke liye vah ise up rajyapal ke paas bhejtaa he
 The reasoning behind this move is that since the Delhi Police reports to the Home Ministry, it should have the same powers as the CBI and NIA in two cases
 sibiai or enie sarkari vakeelon ke naamon kaa prastaav karte hai or centre sarkaar antim nirnay karti he
 Sources said that the police and the law system do not come under the government, so there should be no reason to send the issues related to these two subjects to the Delhi government
 yojana ke anusaar, up rajyapal ko grih mantralay kii ore se aadesh dene ke liye antim praadhikari banaaya ja saktaa he
 - input language balaatkaar par sakht kanoon kii maang abhi thami nahin he
 The protesters did not trust the verbal assurance from the government
 is masale par pradhanmantri ne bhi apni chuppi todi he
 He called the use of force against the protesters wrong and assured them to accept their demands soon
 chalati bas main hue gang rape ke baad uthe andolan ko shant karne kii koshishen sonia gandhi se lekar shila dikshit tak ne kii, lekin kaamyaab nahin hue
 Now Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has taken the front to persuade the protesters
 pehle andolankariyon kii maang ko jaij tehraate hue sahanubhuti jataayi phir shanti baratane kii apil kii
 The Prime Minister tweeted and told the protesters that the current situation is very regrettable, people's anger is also justified
 lekin phir bhi main tamaam logon se apil karata hum ki wo shanti banaae rakhen
 We have constantly monitored the health of the victim
 hamen bhagwaan se uski salaamati kii hua maangani chahie
 The clash between the police and the students is also very regrettable
 ritred justise jees verma kii adhyakshata main banaai cametijanta ke aakrosh ko dekh sarkaar ke kaamkaaj main bhi teji aa gayi he
 The decisions are being made in jokes
 desh ke grahamantri ne yon utpeedan ke maamalon se jude kanoonon kii samiksha ke liye ek cameti banane kaa elaan kiya he
 The chairman of this committee will be former Chief Justice of Supreme Court JS Verma
 ritred justise verma ke alaava cameti main do or sadsy honge
 This committee will give its suggestions in a month, what kind of change is required in the existing law
 centre sarkaar ne cameti ke liye notification bhi jari kar diya he
 BJP demanded to call an all-party meeting, however, on behalf of the BJP, the opposition in the Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj attacked the police action
 unhone twit kiya he ki anyaayi maare bhi or rone bhi na de
 He has accused the government that at first the government cannot protect women and that power is used against those who voice their failure
 sushamaa ne ye bhi kaha ki unhone grih mantri se is mudde par sarvadaleey baithak bulaakar is masale kaa jald se jald hal nikaalane ko kaha he
 The father of the gang rape victim appealed to the people to exercise restraint, while the gang rape victim's father also appealed to the people to exercise restraint
 unhone kaha he ki hamen police kii madad kerani chahie taaki wo jald se jald aropiyon ko sajaa dilaa saken
 The government is restless, wants the protest to end at the earliest
 bihi vajah he ki balaatkaar ke maamle main kuch ahm faisle badi teji se liye jane kaa bhorasa dilaayaa gaya he
 But still the big question is whether the victims will get justice without having to fix the system

 The Bihar government has announced a three-day state mourning on his death
 vah antim samay main congress kaa haath chhodkar sattadhari janata dal united main shaamil ho gaye the
 Mishra, a professor of economics at the University of Bihar, emerged in politics after the death of Lalit Narayan Mishra, who lost his life in a bomb blast at a government event while his brother and railway minister, became such that the Bihar Congress and Jagannath Mishra became complementary to each other
 
 bhai kii viraasat par apane siyaasi kad ko bulandi dene vaale mishra kaa rasookh kam hua, pakad dhili hui to pradesh kii raajnneeti main congress kii haalat bhi patali ho gai
 After the implementation of the report of the Mandal Commission, the changed stream of politics
 jagannatha mishra kaa siyaasi vajood jaateey raajnneeti ke daur main lagbhag nishprabhavi ho gaya or chaara ghotaalaa, golghar or gandhi maidan ko girvee rakhane ke aaropon ne ek tarah se unhen nepathy main dhakel diya
 Born in Balua Bazar in Supaul district of Bihar, Dr
 Mishra was the last Congress Chief Minister of the state
 bhai lalit narayan mishra kii hatya ke baad unki raajnneetik viraasat ko majbootee se aage badhaane vaale jagannatha mishra kii ginati bihar ke kaddavar congressiyon main hoti thi
 He was Chief Minister of United Bihar (then Jharkhand was also a part of Bihar) three times between 1975 and 1990
 bihar kii siyasat ne vah daur bhi dekha, jab pradesh main congress or jagannatha mishra ek-duusare ke poorak se ban gaye the
 With the end of the Jagannath Mishra era, the stars of Congress in Bihar's politics also fell into disrepair
 congress uske baad kabhi nahin ubhar saki
 Raised at a distance of a few steps from Jagannath Mishra's house in Muzaffarpur, senior Bihar journalist Anil Gupta cited leadership vacancy as the main reason for the plight of the Congress after Jagannath Mishra's departure
 unhone kaha ki congress ke tatkaaleen sheersh netritv ne pradesh ke kisi netaa ko ubharne hi nahin diya
 Factionalism was granted gupta ne kaha ki 1975 se 1990 ke bich 16 saal main congress ne kai mukhyamantri badale
 Some other leaders, including Bhagwat Jha Azad, were also made Chief Ministers, who were Bhup of their own region but did not have acceptance in the whole of Bihar and none of them had the support of Mishra
 mandal kamishan kii chhaanv main shuru hui jaateey raajnneeti or lalu yadav ke ubhaar se congress ke saamne rajya main majboot netritv kaa sankat utpann ho gaya
 The party has not been able to overcome the leadership crisis in Bihar politics even after almost three decades
 madhya pradesh ke chambal ilaake main israel kii madad se bharat sena ke liye duniya ke sabase khatarnaak hathiyaar taiyaar kiye ja rahe hai
 For the Indian Army, this work is being done in the Malanpur Industrial Area of bhind area
 khaas baat ye he ki in hathiyaaron kaa istemaal sena ne sargical strike ke vakt bhi kiya tha
 According to the report, last year when the Indian Army carried out a surgical strike in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, the Army used only weapons made with Israel
 ab vahi aadhunik hathiyaaron kaa jakhira bharat ke chambal ke bhind ilaake main punj loyad factory main taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Punj Lloyd has entered into an agreement with the Israeli Vaapan company, whose production has begun in May
 sutron ke mutabik, malanpur ilaake kii is factory main kai alag-alag kism kehthiyaarataiyaar kiye jaaenge, jinamein taiwor-21 asoult lite mashin gans, galeel sniper raifal or eks-95 jaise behad umdaa or khatarnaak hathiyaar shaamil honge
 All these weapons are being prepared not only for the special forces of the Army but also according to the need of the Air Force and Navy
 in hathiyaaron ko banane ke liye malanpur kii factory thik isroyal kii rajdhani tel abeeb main maujuud factory kii tarah banaai gai he
 All these dangerous weapons will also be tested in this factory itself
 yahaan par firing range bhi taiyaar kii gai he
 All these weapons will be kept far away from the reach of common people
 is ilaake ke aas-paas kii suraksha bhi kadi kar di gai he
 This is the specialty of these weapons - Taivor-21, its specialty is its 550 long target and it can fire 650 rounds a minute continuously
 gaalil asalt riflis gan se 750 meter tak nishaanaa bade aaraam se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 This gun is considered very dangerous
 negev lite mashin ganis gan kii khaasiyat he isaki 1 kilometre tak kii maarak kshamta or yah ek minute main 1000 round fire kar sakati he
 The X-95 is a small but capable gun of up to 1 km in size
 jo ek minute main 950 round fire kar sakati he
 The background of Madhu Kankaria's novel 'here We Were' can be understood from this one sentence of Deepshikha that 'jungle Kumar! Success-failure is nothing
 asli cheez hoti he aapke jivan kaa taap kitnon tak pahunchaa
 Life means leaving some marks behind you
 ' is upanyaas main lekhika ne bade hi sahaj or aasaan bhashaa main ek saamaanya stri ke jivan sangharsh ko shabdon main piroyaa he
 Written on the background of Kolkata, this novel describes the social, cultural and economic conditions of this metropolis
 upanyaas ke do mukhya charitra hai - deepashikha or jangal kumaar
 Both came from different backgrounds and different cities but the commonality of goals makes them integral on the path of life
 yah upanyaas deepashikha ke sangharsh se shuru hota he
 a victim of domestic violence, Deepshikha leaves her husband's house and comes to the maternal home with her younger son Sonu
 yahaan apane vajood ko talashti deepashikha computer kaa course jwine karti he or ek jagah programmer kii naukari bhi paa leti he
 While Deepshikha was an open-minded girl, on the other hand, her mother believed in orthodox and orthodox thinking
 donon kii soch main jameen-aasmaan ke antar ke chalate ghar main rose klesh hota he
 In such a hot sun, as the dense tree gives relief, in the same way, Deepshikha's elder brother Atul works as a bridge between the two
 '
 
 
 Think, both of us were very educated, both of us had thought that what happened in our life at Sanvar Gaya, the boy had to be found in this same and anti-women society for marriage
 shaadi ke ghere se nikal jaaen to premi bhi to isi samaaj se milenge
 Today i am able to understand that in order to get the highest life value, it is necessary that the infrastructure to accept these values is ready
 'lekhika is prasang main jis tarah se mahilaon ke jivan sangharsh ke anchhue kisse or pahaluon kaa zikr karti he vah pathak ko sochane par majaboor kar detaa he ki ek stri bhale hi duniya ke kisi bhi kone main ho uskaa jivan kabhi na khatm hone vaali ek jang he
 Madhu Kankaria also looks at the high and low roots spread in the society in the twenty-first century and makes a sharp attack on them
 lekhika aise logon kii maansikta par tikhaa waar karti he, jinako oonche kul main janm lene kaa ghamand hota he,'sudama ne bhi eemaandaaree se apni bhaavana prakat karte hue tagada jawaab diya- 'maa ji itnaa dharm aap karti hai or itnaa nahin jaanati ki sabaki maati ek he
 The color of blood is one
 ham logon ko choti jati kaa bolti hai par aap hamaara kaam nahin sirf cham dekhati hai
 Now you tell me who is the small caste? God took revenge on you
 sari, bathroom kii baltiyaan, pani kii tank tak ko aap mujhase dur rakhti ki kahin chuaa na jaae
 
 
 'A day in the life of Deepshikha, which is cut between home and office, suddenly fills a color
 ek sanstha, deepashikha ko adivasee samskruti or jivan se avgat karaane ke liye teen dinon kii vanayatra yojit karti he, jisamen deepashikha jaati he
 The life and struggle of the tribals changes Deepshikha
 adivaasiyon ke bich jaakar unke sangharsh main sahabhaagi banakar deepashikha apane jivan ko disha detii he
 Madhu Kankaria has amazingly given words to tribal identity and struggle
 prakruti kii manushyon dwaara hui behaal vyavastha padhakar man vichlit ho uthta he
 It is not possible to blindly look at the future by ignoring the danger to which the writer points at the indiscriminate cutting of forests and seeing wild animals homeless
 maanav man ke gahare staron ko chooti yah kahani jivan ke dard or saundarya, prem or udaasi ko adbhut dhang se rachati he
 'we were here' is a research of compassion, resistance, struggle, dreams, resolve and dedication pervading life
 kisi ne kaha tha ki lakshyaheen jivan bhrasht or dayaneey hota he
 This life truth gradually takes shape within the novel's heroine or central identity Deepshikha, to whom Madhu Kankaria has adopted the craft of a diary to give an account of the account
 'ham yahaan the' ek aisa upanyaas he jo jivan ke kathor satya ko vartmaan ke tikhe prakaash main paribhaashit karata he
 Madhu Kankaria's novel, which ruled the hearts of Hindi readers with novels such as Khulla Gagan Ke Lal Sita, Salaam Aakhri, Patta Khor, Sage on Sage and Drying Chinar, will undoubtedly leave a distinct imprint on the hearts and minds of readers

 There are widespread misconceptions about the location of Hindi in India's linguistic landscape
 yah desh kii 22 adhishuchet bhashaaon main se ek he
 According to each census data, it is also the most spoken language in the country
 haalanki hakeekat yah bhi he ki yah bhartiya rajyon main se zyaadaatar kii swaabhaavik bhashaa nahin he, jaise ki dakshin main kerala, tamilnadu, andhra pradesh, telugana, karnataka va puducheri; pashchim main goa, maharashtra or gujarat; uttar-pashchim main punjab va jammu-kashmir; purv main odisha va pashchim bengal or purvottar main sikkim, arunachal pradesh, mizoram, tripura, nagaland, manipur, meghalaya va assam
 These together make up 21 of the 30 states of the country
 mana jaataa he ki hindi himachal pradesh, uttarakhand, rajasthan, bihar, jharkhand va chhattisgarh jaise rajyon kii akeli yaa pramukh bhashaa he lekin in rajyon kii bhashaayi sanrachana ko bhi dhyaan se dekha jaae to un sabaki bhi apni mul kshetreey bhashaa he or unamem hindi ek sajhi antar-raji bhashaa ke taur par kaam karti he
 Hindi is often used as the second language of dialogue for people living in or passing through these states, then it seems to get a strong sense that it is the primary language of these states
 lekin yah baat tathyaatmak rup se sahi nahin he
 After the independence of the country in 1947, the question of conceptualizing any one language as our 'national language' has been repeatedly raised
 rajnatik partiyaan to swaabhaavik taur par rajnatik phaayde ke liye ise uthaati rahi hai
 But if a logical framework for this status is compared to the claim of Hindi against other languages, then it does not completely qualify
 viraasat ke mulya ke lihaaj se dekha jaae to tamil, kannada, telegu, malayalam, marathi, gujarati, sindhi, kashmiri, odissa, bangla, nepali va asamiya kii viraasat hindi se kahin zyada lambii he
 And if seen in terms of rapid growth, then Bhojpuri and even the tribal language Bhili has overtaken Hindi
 bhashaa ke sawaal main ulajhane par saamne aane vaali jatiltaaon kaa zyada spasht najariya hamaare samvidhan nirmaataaon ke paas tha
 In his hypothesis, India was a multilingual country in every sense, not a monolithic nation
 yah tathy, ki samvidhan kii aathvin anusuchee main 14 bhashaaon ko shaamil karne kaa faisla kiya gaya tha, is baat kii ore ingit karata he ki bharat ko kisi ek bhashaa ke saath baandhne kii koi ichha nahin thi
 However, there is no need to use all these factors to underestimate the growing role of Hindi in our mixed national life
 is samay, badhate antar-raji pravaas ko ek prabhavi bhashaayi sampark kii jarurat he
 Hindi fulfills this need with great efficiency because the grammar features of Hindi leave a lot of flexibility in terms of configuration
 aisa is vajah se bhi he ki hindi or telegu va kannada jaisi baaki bhashaaon main shabd bhandar kaa kaaphi bada saajha strot he
 Then, in terms of other countries, Hindi is being seen as the main language of India
 iske alaava shahari kshetron ke samajashaastra main hindi kii kaamkaaji upyogita zyada hone lagi he
 Due to all these functional and structural features, one may be forced to propose Hindi as India's number one language, but it would be more practical to declare it as 'second national language', and there are many reasons
 takneekee taur par 'duusari bhashaa' vah hoti he jise koi shaks ghar par nahin balki bazaar main, kaamkaaj kii jagah par or mahanagareey saamaajik daayaron main istemaal karata he, lekin na to ghar par or na hi apane saanskrithik aadan-pradaan ke kareebi daayre main
 Currently, there are about 800 living languages and dialects in India
 vyavhaar main to nahin lekin saidhantik rup se 799 bhashaaon ke log hindi kaa istemaal alag-alag str kii kushalta ke saath karte hai
 In this way, Hindi is the primary language of those who consider it as their mother tongue and the second language of those who consider another language as their mother tongue
 aise main agar 800 main se 799 bhashaa samudaay hindi ko duusari bhashaa maanate hon to bhi zyada se zyada vah hamaari duusari rashtriya bhashaa ho sakati he, isse zyada kuch bhi nahin
 Trying to do anything beyond this will be fundamentally undemocratic and will harm India's deep multilingual past and present

 The fifth week of Bigg Boss 13 has started, the show is in its thrilling turn
 sho main drame kaa hai dose badhata hi ja rahaa he
 But in all of these, there is a contestant who has been the talk of the town since the beginning of the show and this contestant is Siddharth Shukla
 soshal media par siddharth ko yun to mixd riection mil rahe hai, lekin sho main sabase zyada charchaa unheen kii ho rahi he
 TJ Sidhu, wife of TV actor Karanvir Bohra, feels the same
 tijebig boski badi fain hai or wo har baar kii tarah sijan 13 ko bhi achche se follow kar rahi hai
 TJ believes that all contestants in Bigg Boss house somehow revolve around Siddharth Shukla, so that he can get the footage
 You can like / dislike # siddarthshuklabut truth is, he's the centre of the # bb13universe
 & everyone trying 2be a part of his orbit
 
 Evn if it means drawing attention to their past dating history w / him
 # biggboss13@colorstv@justvoot— Teejay Sidhu (@bombaysunshine)october 31, 2019tije ne siddharth shukla ke saport main apane twitor handle par ek post share kiya he
 TJ wrote in the post- You can like or dislike Siddharth Shukla
 lekin sach to ye he ki siddharth bibi 13 ke univers ke centre hai or har koi unke orbit kaa hissaa bane rahanaa chahta he
 Even if they want to have a relationship that was in their past
 bataa den ki tije se pehle big bos kii eks contestants or tivi actress kamya punjabi or kishwar marchent siddharth shukla ke saport main saamne aa chuki hai
 Both of them were very appreciative of Siddharth's game on the show
 kamya or kishwar ke mutabik big bos 13 main sirf siddharth hi akele aise contestant hai, jo sho main anterten kar rahe hai
 If Siddharth was not part of Bigg Boss 13 the show would have been quite boring

 Ideally those weapons should be dismantled, but this did not happen
 purushottam ne inhen bekaar padi eke 47 riflon ko repering kar bechney kaa plan banaaya tha
 Now who else could be a better place to sell weapons than Munger? The illegal arms market is already operating in Munger
 yahaan hathiyaaron ke saudagar khud chal kar aate hai
 Here both the seller and the seller are easily found
 purushottam ne hathiyaaron ko surakshit pahunchane ke liye apni patni chandravati devi ko bhi saath liya, taaki kisi ko shaq na ho
 Both these husband and wife used to transport these items of death to Munger via train

 This business was going on since 2012
 is dauraan kareeb 60-70 eke 47 riflein donon pati-patni ne munger pahunchaai, jinamein se 20 riflein baraamad ho chuki hai or baaki kii khoj jari he
 Jabalpur police reached Munger in case of AK-47 investigation

 At the same time, SP President Akhilesh Yadav has also welcomed Priyanka's entry into politics

 But it seems that BSP supremo Mayawati is not in the mood to spare Rahul Gandhi
 isaki ek vajah yah bhi ho sakati he ki indira gandhi ke samay congress kaa kor votbank essi / asti or savarnon main brahman hi hua karte the
 In the current politics, Mayawati's vote bank is SC / ST and she has also wooed the Brahmin

 lakhon mandiron main karodon log sankalp le rahe hai ki sansad main kanoon banaakar mandir banaaya jaae
 In order to keep the dignity of democracy, it is necessary that a temple should be made by making laws in Parliament in view of public opinion
 lekin is masale ke phir se raajnneetikaran kaa khatra nahin he?dekhie, yah kaarykram santon ne tay kiya he
 It is not a matter of vote
 yah rashtriya vishay he
 One should not take political mileage into it
 yah rajnatik milage kaa vishay nahin he
 Building a temple on the Ram Janmabhoomi is necessary for world peace
 kanoon banaakar janmasthan par mandir banavaane kii yah maang kabhi palampur main bhaajapa ne uthaai thi
 But he came back when he came into government
 is samay aapaki is maang main vah saath he?unako yah nahin karnaa chahie tha
 They have to accept this mistake, i believe
 bhul sweekaar kerani padegi kyonki ram ko satta kaa vishay bananaa
 
 
 Make the subject of vote
 
 
 or janmabhumi ke liye kuch nahin karnaa
 
 
 They ask their conscience whether it is okay? If such a mistake has happened to them, then they should accept this mistake, it is believed
 kya puraa sangh parivaar is ladaai main aapke saath he?keval sangh parivaar hi nahin, sara sant samaaj he
 All the great saints and saints have been supporting our movement from the beginning
 ve hamaare andolan main hai, aisa nahin kah sakate, lekin jo kaarykram hamane liye hai, unamem sab sant, saare hindu sanghathan hamaare saath hai
 The Sangh Parivar is there
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh to is puure prakaran main shuru se hi judaa hua he
 We first collected 11 crore signatures
 vah sirf hastakshar nahin, ek sankalp he
 And the BJP is also with you? i believe that the BJP will also join it as a Hindu
 rajnatik dal ke naate nahin, ek hindu ke naate vah jarur shaamil hogi
 There are a large number of such people in the BJP
 hanuman ko sabhi maanate hai
 i say that not only BJP, whether in BSP, SP, Congress or anywhere else, everyone should support
 sansad main kanoon banane kii maang se lagata he ki hycourt ke faisle kii yaa to aapako parvaah nahin he yaa phir faisla apane khilaaf aane kaa dar he
 The High Court will decide
 paksh main aayega to log anand manaayenge
 If you come against, people should not stand for the struggle on the streets
 hindu samaaj ke jo sanskaar hai usko dekhte hue ve ek maryaada main rahakar hi anand manaayenge or pratikul aata he to bhi sanyat rahete hue kaarykram chalaane chahie
 Do you think the government will consider the demand for land by making laws? See, if the issue of Ram Sethu is solved, it is also settled on the basis of manpower
 supreme court main maamla gaya to nyaayadhishon ko laga ki yah bada gambhir vishay he or isliye unhone uskaa rasta nikaalane kii koshish kii or rasta niklaa
 Breaking Ram Setu can no longer be given to water transporters in future
 amarnath kaa shrin board kaa jo masalaa aayaa vahaan bhi janashakti ke dabaav main hi 100 acre jameen waapas kerani padi
 We do not believe in violent conflict
 musalmaan shantipriy he
 As Muslim as it is, everyone is peace loving
 lekin unka apharan kar liya he jihadiyon ne
 This crisis is in front of Muslims
 jihadiyon ke dar se hi koi udaaravaadi musalmaan bhi yah nahin kah saktaa ki teen mandir hinduon ko de do
 Because of the Crusaders, God is sitting in the temple of clothes
 koi udaaravaadi musalmaan bole to turant hi hitalist main aa jayega
 Everyone should consider that the time has come for mutual relations
 agar hycourt ne aapke pratikul faisla diya to kya supreme court jaaenge?jaaenge
 Will definitely go
 ramsetu kii tarah or shrin board masale kii tarah aapke jan dabaav ke saamne sarkaar is maamle main bhi jhukne vaali he?ise jan dabaav mat kahie, janashakti kahie
 Ram is in the conscience of every general MP
 ek bhavy mandir bananaa chahie, har koi chahega, aisa meraa maananaa he
 The temple should be built by consensus
 lekin samajhaite se nahin ho saktaa
 There is no scope for compromise
 badi koshish kii ham logon ne, nahin ho paaya
 So the matter is at a decisive point? The only way is to make laws in Parliament
 yah hoga
 i believe that in a year, all things will be decided and the temple will be built
 aapane pradhanmantri se milakar aisa anurodh kiya he?maine ganga ke bare main chitthee likhi thi, unhone nirnay bhi kiya he
 i am very happy
 unako ek chitthee likhi he, uttar bhi aayaa he
 i have also written to him about the temple that such a decision has been made by us
 unka jawaab aayaa he ki chitthee mil gai he
 If Manmohan Singh ji has done all this about the Ganges, then i believe that he will definitely do the Ram Janmabhoomi

 People who came out of the mild earthquake in Bikaner have felt the tremors in Rajasthan
 rajya ke bikaner jile or uske aasapaas ke ilaakon main ravivaar subah bukamp ke jabadast jatke mahasoos kiye gaye hai
 Due to this, people came out of their homes
 bikaner main aae is bukamp kii tivrata richter scale par 4
 5 is pegged
 jatke kaa ehsaas hote hi log ghar se baahar nikal aae
 On seeing the crowd crowded on the streets
 thodi hi der main vahaan afra-tafari kaa maahaul paidaa ho gaya
 The earthquake was 10 KM below, according to government sources, the earthquake came at 10
36 am, its center was 10 km below the ground
 bukamp se abtak kisi tarah ke nuksaan kii khabar nahin he
 The administration has appealed to the people to ignore the rumors and stay in a safe place
 bataa den ki pichley maheene hi rajasthan ke jhunjhunuun jile main bukamp ke halke jatke mahasoos kiye gaye the
 3 on the Richter scale of this earthquake
 8 maapi gai thi
 These tremors were felt in Bikaner city, including Khajuwala, Sattasar, Chhattisgarh, Kalasar and Nursar in about half a dozen villages
 bukamp ke jatke kaa daur guzar jane ke baad logon ne aas-paas ke ilaakon main phone karnaa shuru kar diya or apane sage-sambandhiyon kaa haal-chaal poocha
 But in spite of all this, the Jat community does not see any option other than BJP
 jaaton ne kabhi bhi daliton ke saath vot nahin diya, na hi mayawati kii bispi kaa samarthan kiya
 The Jat is also not very enthusiastic about the sp-congress alliance as more Muslim votes are being given importance there
 haalanki unhen lagata he ki ajit singh kisaanon kii samasya par gaur kar sakate hai lekin kaiyon ko 77 saal ke areldi pramukh main ab wo baat nahin rahi
 Not only this, Ajit Singh's party has also fielded many Muslim candidates in this area - seeing all this, some Jats feel that they have no option but to support the BJP
 haalanki jaaton ke is ilaake main ek baat jo baar baar sunne ko mil rahi he wo yah ki - iskaa matlab ye nahin he ki ham sab sampradayik hai yaa ham centre main bijepi sarkaar ke kaam se khush hai
 But no party is thinking ahead of us
 ' After a long wait and several rounds of meetings, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) finally released the first list of its 185 candidates for the Lok Sabha elections on Holi and played a key role in raising the party to power from this list
 Veteran leader LK Advani was dropped and the party's current president Amit Shah was replaced
 haalanki adwani kaa tikat kaatane ke peeche bijepi kii sochi samajhi ranneeti maani ja rahi he
 The BJP has cut the ticket of MP LK Advani from Gandhinagar and replaced President Amit Shah as its candidate
 gandhinagar se shah ko ummidavaar banaae jane ke saath hi aisa mana ja rahaa he ki adwani kaa raajnneetik kariyar ab khatm ho gaya he
 Advani is one of the few leaders who, on the strength of his untiring efforts, once led the Bharatiya Janata Party with 2 mps to power
 bijepi main halchal badhigandhinagar se chah baar ke saansad adwani ab 91 saal ke ho chuke hai
 There has been a stir in the BJP after his ticket was cut
 haalanki bijepi kii taraf se yah sanket milane lage the ki 75 kii umr ke paar netaaon ko is baar tikat nahin diya jayega
 Gandhinagar has been extremely special for Advani's political career
 vah pehali baar 1991 main yahaan se chunaav jite the
 After this, since 1998, he has won 5 consecutive elections
 bijepi ke sthaneey netaa pradeep singh baghel kaa kahana he ki faisla party ke sansadeey board kaa he or ab yahaan se party ke adhyaksh amit shah chunaav lard rahe hai
 Workers and people are very happy about this decision
 gandhinagar se shah ke chunaav ladane se party ko joardaar urja mili he or is faisle ke baad party gujarat kii 26 kii 26 loksabhaa seat jeetegi
 BJP is scared: On the other side, local Congress leader Lalji Bhai Desai from Gandhinagar said about Shah's contesting from here that we will win this time
 amit shah ko kadi takkar dene ke liye congress ke paas is seat se kaabil ummidavaar hone ke sawaal par lalji bhai desai ne kaha ki hamaare paas kai ummidavaar hai
 The party has to decide which candidate to contest from
 is baar gujarat ke andar bijepi baukhalaai hui he
 They feel that the BJP is scared and upset due to the failure of the strategy to win 26 seats in 26 seats
 unhone aage kaha ki bijepi ko gujarat main apni haar kaa dar he kyonki agar aisa nahin hota to vah raturaat hamaare kuch vidhayakon ko mantri nahin banaate
 BJP is scared that its performance will not be special this time
 adwani kaa tikat kaate jane par desai ne kaha ki bijepi ne apane sansthaapak or mukhiya ko tikat na dekar unhen apamaanit kiya he
 He is an elderly fellow and should have been respected
 vah ek sammanjanak vidaai ke hakdaar the
 Local strategy Sudhir Rawal said that there is a big strategy behind cutting Advani's ticket and giving tickets to Shah
 yah damege control karne kii koshish bhi he kyonki yahaan par patidaar samaaj narendra modi se naaraaz chal rahaa he
 Shah will win easily if Shah contests from here due to his large seat
 agar vah yahaan chunaav prachaar ke liye bhi nahin aate hai to bhi aasaani se chunaav jeet jaaenge
 On Advani's decision to cut the ticket to Amit Shah from Gandhinagar, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari says that this decision belongs to the party and after this the Parliamentary Board has also agreed on it, so no more has been said on this decision
 should go
 adwani hamaare maardarshak the, maardarshak hai or aage bhi maargdarshan denge
 He is the senior leader of our party and the party respects him
 gadakari ne aage kaha ki unki umr 90 saal kii ho gai he
 In such a situation, the party has given opportunity to other people and now our president Amit Shah will contest from Gandhinagar
 party main atal-adwani yug kii samaapti par nitin gadakari kaa kahana he ki yug kii samaapti kii baat nahin he
 The party keeps moving forward, but there is always respect for senior leaders in the party
 sthaneey str par mana ja rahaa he ki ab amit shah gandhinagar se chunaav ladane ja rahe hai to bina kisi khaas sangharsh ke vah chunaav to jeet jaaenge hi, saath hi unke gujarat main loksabhaa chunaav ladane kaa phayda rajya kii anya sansadeey siton par hoga
