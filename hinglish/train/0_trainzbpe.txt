 input- PTI The decision of the Indian team management to give preference to Shikhar Dhawan as Gautam Gambhir as an opener in the Kolkata Test is under question
 test cricket main bure form se guzar rahe dhawan pehali pari ke baad ravivaar ko bhi naakaam rahe
 Dhawan looked in good touch during India's second innings
 newjiland kii tej gendbaaj jodi trent bolt or mat henry ko unhone do-do chauke lagaae lekin badi pari nahin khel paae
 Bolt made him LBW for 17 runs (32 runs, four fours)
 gauratlab he ki pehali pari main bhi dhawan ek ran hi bana paae the
 Actually, the in-form KL Rahul's injury before the second Test match between India and New Zealand was a shock for Team India
 rahul kii jagah gautam gambhir ko team main sthaan diya gaya jabaki ek anya openar shikhar dhawan pehle hi team main maujuud the
 In such a situation, it was not easy for the team management to choose between Dhawan and Gambhir as Vijay's partner
 dhawan or gambhir, donon ke apane 'plus' or 'mines' point the
 Gautam Gambhir did well with the bat in the Duleep Trophy recently
 test cricket main unka ausat bhi behtareen (42
 58)
 vahiin agast 2014 ke baad koi test nahin khelnaa tathaa 35 varsh kii umr hona unke khilaaf ja rahaa tha
 Talking about Dhawan, being younger than Gautam and gaining confidence of captain Kohli went in his favor
 yahi kaaran rahaa ki dhawan ko unke haal ke kamjor pradarshan ke baavjood gambhir par tarjeeh di gai
 The comments westeindies ke khilaaf, carabian maidaanon par hui siries ke pehle test main unhone 84 ran banaakar acchhee shuruyaat kii thi lekin iske baad agali teen pariyon main ve 54 ran hi bana paae the
 More than the failure to score runs, the way Dhawan was dismissed was causing concern for the management
 unhone zyaadaatar baar set hone ke baad wicket ganvaaya
 Anyway, after playing a blistering 187-run knock against Australia in the first Test of his career, Dhawan has lacked consistency
 unka ballebaaji pradarshan 'kabhi achche or kabhi kamjor' ke bich jhulata rahaa he
 In 2015, Dhawan could not score a big score in the series against South Africa and he missed the loss of wickets after being set
 mohali main hue siries ke pehle test main to ve donon pariyon main 0 par out hue the
 However, Shikhar had a good chance to 'seal' his place after getting a place in the playing XI in Kolkata but he missed it
 
 
 darasal, bharat or newjiland ke bich duusare test match ke pehle 'in form' keel rahul kaa chongrast hona team india ke liye jatke kii tarah rahaa
 Gautam Gambhir was replaced in the squad in place of Rahul while another opener Shikhar Dhawan was already in the squad
 aise main vijay ke jodidar ke rup main dhawan or gambhir main se kisi ek ko chunanaa team management ke liye aasaan nahin tha
 Both Dhawan and Gambhir had their 'plus' and 'minus' points
 gautam gambhir ne dalip trophy main haal hi main balle se acha pradarshan kiya tha
 His average in Test cricket is also excellent (42
 58) he
 At the same time, not playing any test after August 2014 and being 35 years old was going against him
 dhawan ke lihaaj se baat karen to gautam ke mukaable kam umr kaa hona or captain kohli kaa bharosa hasil hona unke paksh main gaya
 That is why Dhawan was preferred over Gambhir despite his recent poor performance
 tippaniyan In the first test of the series on the Caribbean grounds, he started well by scoring 84 runs against West Indies but after that he was able to score 54 runs in the next three innings
 ran banane main naakaami se kahin adhik dhawan ke out hone kaa tarika prabandhan ke liye chintaa kaa kaaran ban rahaa tha
 He lost the wicket after being set more often
 vaise bhi apane kariyar ke pehle test main australia ke khilaaf 187 ranon kii dhamaakedaar pari khilne ke baad dhawan ke pradarshan main sthirataa kaa abhaav rahaa he
 His batting performance has been swinging between 'sometimes good and sometimes weak'
 2015 main dakshin africa ke khilaaf siries main bhi dhawan bada score nahin bana paae the or set hone ke baad wicket ganvaane kii chook unhen baari padi thi
 In the first test of the series in Mohali, he was dismissed at 0 in both innings
 baharhaal, kolkata main plaing ilevan main jagah milane ke baad shikhar ke paas apana sthaan 'sil' karne kaa acha mauka tha lekin ve ise chook gaye

 vivaadaaspad australian alrounder andrew symonds kosharab se judi ghatnake baad isisi vishwa twanti 20championships se baahar kar, unhen swadesh bhej diya gaya
 This information has been given in media reports
 cricket austrailia ke mukhya kaaryakari james sadarland ne kaha ki 33 varshiya symonds ne pichley 24 se 48 ghanteke bich kai niyamon kaa ulanghan kiya or sie ab unhen waapas austrailia bhejne kii aupchaariktaayen puri kar rahaa he
 Sutherland told journalists that the rule i am talking about is not serious, but given their antics and history, they are enough to take a final decision
 unhone kaha ki symonds kaa sie se anubandh par bhi samiksha kii jaaegi
 Symonds' contract was renewed only last month
 symonds ke puraane vivadasymonds iske baad bhi nahin sudhare
 He met a rugby player at a nightclub during a South African tour of Australia in March 2006 and was then rescued by Michael Clarke from the controversy
 symonds ke karier kaa sabase bada vivaad pichley saal bhartiya team ke austrailian daure ke dauraan sidney test main hua
 The Indian players were the target of Symonds and in this case they accused Harbhajan Singh that the off-spinner called him (monkey)
 match referi mike practor ne jab harbhajan par pratibandh lagaaya to yah maamla tool pakad gaya or cricket jagat do faad hone kii sthiti main pahunch gaya
 Harbhajan appealed against the ban in which he won, which made Symonds feel that Cricket Australia let him down
 iske baad jab bangladesh kii team agast 2008 main austrailian daure par gayi to symonds darwin ekadivasiy match se pehle anivaary team baithak main bhaag lene ke bajaay machhlee pakadaney chale gayi
 He was then dropped from the series and asked to participate in the rehabilitation program
 unhen bharat daure par aayi team main bhi nahin chunaa gaya
 Symonds was selected in the squad against New Zealand but in November 2008 he clashed with a man at a hotel in Brisbane
 iske baad jab newjiland ke wicketiper ballebaaj brandan maikulam ne new south wales ke saath anubandh kiya to symonds ne radio intervyuu main unako bhaddi gaaliyaan dekar apni pareshaani badha di
 Symonds publicly apologized for this and Cricket Australia fined him 4000 Australian dollars
 cricket austrailia ke mukhya kaaryakari james sadarland ne haal main is alrounder ko saaf aagaah kar diya tha ki aage unki galat harkaton ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya jayega
 He said that his (symonds) future is in his own hands
 maidan ke andar or baahar uskaa vyavhaar kaise rahata he yah vahi jaanata he
 The South African team, which has lost three consecutive odis to Team India, has made a big plan to stop India's victory in the fourth ODI
 africa harfanmaulaa khilaadi kris morris kaa maananaa he ki bhartiya captain viraat kohli ko saste main out kar unki team maujuuda siries main bharat ke achche pradarshan ko roak sakati he
 Will India have a chance to create history, will sa's fortunes change in pink odis? After a 3-0 unbeatable lead in the series, India now need just one more win to win the first ODI series on South African soil
 morris ne chauthe match se pehle kaha, ‘aap hameshaa virdohi team ke mukhya khilaadi ko out karnaa chaahate hai
 Kohli is a big player in the team and is currently scoring runs for the team
 ’aakhir kyon pink vanade main team india par kahar banakar tootenge divilliarsunhen lagata he ki kohli ko saste main niptaana unki team ke liye safalataa kii kunjee ho sakati he,kyonki duusare bhartiya ballebaajon ne kuch khaas nahin kiya he
 Morris said, '34 ODI centuries themselves speak of his ability
 unhone har desh (jis desh main bhi khelaa he) main shatak banaaya he
 He is currently in amazing form
 agar hamane unhen saste main out kar diya, to bharat par dabaav bana sakate hai
 'for us,' said Morris, it is a 'do or die' situation, it is natural pressure
 agar chauthaa vanade haare, to siries ganvaa baithenge
 We will compete on every ball, also for every run
 isliye kaaphi dawaab hoga, lekin bina dabaav kaa kaisaa cricket? bahut ubaau
 ' gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki shaharikaran ko chunauti ke taur par dekhne ke bajaay ise avasar main badla janaa chahie
 Modi said that we continue to express concerns about the villagers moving towards the cities
 lekin agar ham pehle din se sach sweekaar karte to kya hota? ise chunauti ke taur par nahin dekha janaa chahie
 Why is it not considered as coercion? Once you see it as an opportunity, the work can be done effectively and will have good results
 modi ne kaha ki puraani maansikta kuch badal nahin sakati kyonki teji se ho rahaa shaharikaran vaastaviktaa he
 Modi said that to transform our cities, there is a need to innovate our approach with things like modern initiatives like solid waste management and new technology
 modi ‘sampurna shahari vikaas’ vishay par rashtriya sammelan ke udghaatan satr main bol rahe the jisamen 26 rajyon, 411 jilon ke pratinidhiyon, mahagauron, upmahapuron or vibhinn shaharon ke anya adhikariyon ne bhaag liya
 Modi said that people should concentrate on the year 2022 when India will celebrate 75th Independence Day
 modi ne logon se kaha ki ve sochen ki ve varsh 2022 main apane shahar ko kaisaa banane kaa sapana dekhte hai or iske anusaar pariyojna taiyaar kiijie
 Modi said that we are criticized everywhere in the world that we keep our cities dirty
 anya baat jise dimag main rakhaa janaa chahie ki apane jeevankaal main swatchta ko kaaphi mahatv dene vaale yug purush mahatma gandhi kii 150veen jainti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue shaharon ko saaf rakhane kaa kaam kiya jaae
 Modi recalled his meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh a few years ago where he gave the Prime Minister the idea of choosing 500 cities in India and focusing on solid waste management and waste water treatment in these cities
 modi ne kaha ki unhone pradhanmantri se jeenenyuarem ke agali peedhee ke kaarykram par gaur karne kaa anurodh kiya tha
 Though the Prime Minister praised the idea but nothing was done
 modi ne kaha ki gujarat ne payalat pariyojna ke taur par pareekshan kiya lekin kendra kii ore se koi pratikriya nahin mili jisase gujarat sarkaar in shaharon main in pahalon ko shuru karne ke liye majaboor hui taaki ise aagaamee samay main asardaar banaaya ja sake

 Due to sticking wood in the throat of the student, his breathing tube and food pipe have been cut
 parijanon ko chaatr ke saath hui barbarta kaa pataa tab chalaa, jab chaatr ne ghar pahunchakar ultiyaan kerani shuru kar deen or uske munh se khun aane laga
 The family immediately admitted the student to the nearest hospital

 Justice Markandeyakatju, President of the Press Council of India (PCI), wrote a letter to President Pranab Mukherjee seeking pardon for Devender Pal Singh Bhullar, who was sentenced to death in the 1993 Delhi bomb blast case
 katju ne yah patr ucchtam nyaayalay ke do nyaayadhishon vaali ek peeth dwaara sajaa-e-maut ke khilaaf khalistaan aatankwaadi bhullar kii yachika ke khaarij kiye jane ke kuch dinon baad likhaa he
 That court decision cleared the way for Bhullar to be hanged
 katju ne kaha ki bhullar janvari 1995 main bharat aane ke baad se hi jail main band he
 He has been in jail for the last 18 years
 use apni faansee ke liye kaaphi lambey samay tak intjaar karnaa padaa jisase use kaaphi lambey samay maansik pidaa jhelni padi is dauraan kyonki uske sir par khatre kii talwaar latakati rahi
 Giving reasons for his appeal, he said that the Supreme Court had rejected his appeal against Bhullar's execution by two to one, a decision not unanimous
 unhone kaha ki peeth ke varishthatam nyaayamurti em bi shah bhullar ko bari kar chuke the
 Katju said that he read the judgment of Justice Shah who pointed out that the only evidence against Bhullar was his alleged confession which he had given to the investigating office
 nyaayamurti shah ne kaha tha ki ‘jab ikbaalia bayaan main namit anya aropiyon ko naa to doshi tehraaya gaya or naa hi mukadmaa chalaaya gaya tha to yah apilkarta ko keval us tathakthith ikbaalia bayaan ke aadhaar par doshi tehraane ke liye feet maamla nahin he jo ki police adhikari dwaara darj kiya gaya tha
 Katju said that Justice Shah in his judgment had pointed out that there is nothing in the record to corroborate the above alleged confession
 unhone kaha ki adaalat kii peeth ke bahumat ke faisle ko sweekaar karnaa padaa tha lekin kaha ki samvidhan ke anuchhed 72

 Moin Ali had earlier picked up Pujara's wicket

 After which Yogi Adityanath had said that the UP government is ready to provide all possible help on this issue
 aap maane yaa naa maane lekin ye hakeekat ki upi ke sarkari skulon me bacchon kii padhai bina kitabon ke ho rahi he
 More than 1
5 crore children from class one to class eight get free government books with the opening of school in the first week of July, but this year due to the controversies of the tender process and government hijabali these books are now Haven't even been able to go for printing
 philhal upi ke lagbhag do lakhprimaryor middle skulon me bina kitabon ke yaa phir puraani kitabon ke sahare padhai chal rahi he
 Although the government says that all the disputes have been resolved and books will start distribution after the next fifteen days, the government is not in a position to say anything about the loss of children's education due to this delay
 gauratlab he ki sarkaar ko aane vaale dinon bacchon me lagbhag teraa karod kitaaben chhapakar baantni hai
 The old publishers who have worked with the UP government believe that it will take about three months more time for the government to complete this work
 puraani kitabon se kaam chalaa rahe bachche'sab padhein-sab badhen' kaa naaraa dene vaale uttar pradesh ke sarkari parishadiy skulon kaa nayaa satr to do july se shuru ho gaya he, lekin vibhaag abhi tak skool ke bacchon ko milane vaali kitaaben muhaiyaa nahin kara paaya he
 Millions of students studying in up's council schools, from class one to class eight, are working with those torn old books of their seniors, which have been provided to them by teachers after passing out
 har saal june main chap jaati hai kitabendrasal har saal farvari me kitabon kii chapai kaa tender jari ho jaataa tha or june tak kitaaben chhapakar july me bant jaati thi
 But this time due to an order from top government officials, the whole process has been delayed
 is baar shiksha vibhaag ne ye sarkari aadesh jari kar diya ki kitaaben paryaavaran ke anukool (ENVIRNMENT FRIENDLY) kaagajon par hi chhapegin, jabaki isse pehle paramparaagat kaagajon (RECYCLE PAPERS) kitabon kii chapai ho jaati thi
 However, top officials of basic education say that this was done under an order of the High Court
 lekin iske chalate na keval tender prakriya me deree hui balki chapai kii laagat bhi bad gai
 Last year, the tender rate was one rupee nine paise per form (eight pages), while this year the rate was one rupee thirty-eight paise, last year the total printing contract was 200 crores, while this year this contract increased to 260 crores
 is
 adhikariyon kii manamaani ke chalate hui deribasic shiksha ke saath pichley kai saalon se kaam kar rahe puraane prakashkon kaa aarope he ki basic shiksha vibhaag main aalaa adhikariyon kii manamaani chal rahi he or jaanboojhkar gajiabad kii ek form ko phayda pahuchane ke liye unke aavedan (tender) ko disqualifi (radd) kar diya gaya, jiske virodh me wo hai court chale gaye
 Due to this, the tender process got caught in controversies and the printing of books got stuck in the balance and the government is also having to bear an additional burden of sixty crore
 udhar sarkaar kaa kahana he ki paryaavaran kii suraksha ke liye ye faisla kiya gaya or tender prakriya ko puri tarah se paardarshee rakhaa gaya he, tender ho chuke hai kitaaben chhapane ke liye ja chuki hai or agle pandrah dinon me ise baantne kaa kaam shuru kar diya jayega
 The books will be distributed first in the flood affected areas and later in other places
 sachiv basic shiksha adhikari ajay pratap singh ne kaha ki tender main kuch legal ishyus aa gaye the
 And now all of them are shutout
 or agreement bhi ho gaye hai
 Books will start being received within 15 days

 RIP Bravo journalist kya aapane raat main kabhi kaali billi dekhi he? andhere main kaali billi kaa sharir to dikhaai nahin detaa he lekin uski jugnu-si chamakati hui ankhon ko dekhakar har koi pehali baar main to dar hi jaataa he
 Like the cat, the eyes of many other animals including lion, cheetah, leopard glow in the night
 kya aap jaanate hai ki aisa kyon hota he?jin jaanwaron kii ankhen chamakati he, unki ankhon main ek vishesh prakaar ke manibhiya padaarth (crystalline Sbstance) kii patali parat hoti he
 This thin layer reflects the light falling on the eyes
 yah thik usee tarah kii kriya he, jaise kisi darpan par surya kii kiran padate hi chamakane lagati he
 At the same time, an experiment done on the eyes of the cat shows that behind the curtain of his eyes there is a layer of luminous substance called Luminous tepetum
 yah padaarth prakaash ko paravartit karata he
 Due to this layer the cat can easily see things even in very low light
 ve sabhi jaanavar jinaki ankhen raat main chamakati he, ve andhere main bhaleebhanti dekh sakate hai
 Apart from this, another thing is worth noting that the animals whose eyes glow in the night, do not all have the same color of brightness
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki jin jaanwaron kii ankhon main khun kii nasen adhik hoti hai, unki ankhon kii chamak laal rang kii hoti he
 At the same time, animals whose eyes have low blood veins, their eyes glow white or light yellow

 In some form, it is engaged in imposing on the people of the country
 unhone kaha, "taaja vivaad main muslim personal lau va teen talaak ke sharia se sambandhit mudde tathaa atyant hi samvedansheel kaaman civil code (ek samaan naagarik samhita) ke masale ko ched diya gaya he
 Earlier, Aligarh Muslim University and Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University snatched away the status of a minority educational institution and created a controversy by restarting a settled case

 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Mayawati has issued a statement here today, stating that ever since the BJP has formed an absolute majority government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Center, the BJP has not received any narrow, communal and fundamentalist agenda of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)
 In some form, it is engaged in imposing on the people of the country

 Sitting on the chairs there, our leaders make various laws for our prosperity, progress and protection
 par zaraa sochen
 Those who are considered enemies of law in the record of law, while people sit on these chairs, then what will be the shape of law in the country? But this time the musclemen have changed their game slightly to enter the Parliament House
 kanoonee roak ke chalate is baar chunavi maidan main bahut se bahubaliyon ne apni-apni shrimati ko utaar diya he
 Terror is another name
 These mafia are many faces who have trampled under the law of the world king of crime in Donbihar, who have traded fear and terror for a long time on the land of Bihar
 aisa hi kai naam he
 Shahabuddin, the don of Siwan
 mokama kaa sabase bada mafia surajbhaan
 Munna Shukla, the don of Vaishali
 iske alaava anand mohan, satish doobe, pappu yadav or anant singh
 There are many names that once come on the road together, then think about the chaos
 patniyon ke sahare kursi paane kii lalakainamein se kuch pehle hi apni dehshat ke bal par sansad bhawan kii saiyr kar chuke hai
 Everyone wanted to reach this time too
 par apane-apane karnaamon kii vajah se inamen se kuch jail main band hai or inke chunaav ladane par kanuunan roak he
 What did the law stop them? These people created a unique conspiracy to break into political corridors this time
 saazish apni-apni shrimati ke boote sansad kii kursi hathiyaane kii
 Every third MP in 2014 was Dagibat from 2014
 chunavi nataji aayaa to log hairat main the
 The public had given mandates to more Bahubali Surmas or tainted candidates in 2014 than in 2009
 parliament kii 543 jimmedaar kursiyon par tab aapraadhik chhavi ke kul 186 gaiyr-jimmedaar apni tasharif kaa tokara rakh rahe the
 That is, every third MP who reached the Parliament was tainted
 chaahe bihar ho yaa upi
 West Bengal or Maharashtra
 janata ne tab har jagah takat or baahubal ke bal par sansad tak pahunchane kii hasarat paalane vaale zyaadaatar bahubaliyon ko jeet dilaai thi
 Such tainted leaders had reached Parliament, however in 2009 150 mps of total criminal image had reached Parliament
 jabaki 2014 main ye taadaad bad kar 186 ho gai thi
 Of these 112 were those who were facing trial in serious cases
 inamen hatya or hatya kii koshish jaise sangeen gunaah tak shaamil hai
 How much will tainted parliamentarians say now 2019? What will be the picture of the coming Lok Sabha? kanoon ke kitne dushman kanoon banane vaali loksabhaa kii kursiyon par tasharif rakhenge? puraane jurm, adalati roak or chunaav ayog kii bandishon ne kuch aisa kiya he ki apane bahut se bahubali is baar chunavi maidan se gaayab ho gaye hai
 These include names like Shahabuddin, Suryabhan Singh, Prabhunath Singh, Anant Singh, Munna Shukla, Rajan Tiwari, Satish Chandra Dubey, Rama Singh, Manmoranjan Singh
 daagi netaaon kii patniyaan maidan menlekin ye log sirf chunaav se gaayab hue hai
 But this is the real face in the changed face
 kyonki khel ye hua he ki in logon ne khud kii jagah apni patni or rishtedaaron ko chunavi maidan main utaar diya he
 Amazing that all political parties have embraced them with equal love
 siwan kii chunavi jangbihar ke siwan main kareeb 9 lakh votaron ke saamne loksabhaa chunaav main apana saansad chunane ke liye mukhya rup se sirf do vikalp hai
 The first is to choose Hina Shahab, the wife of Bahubali Shahabuddin and RJD candidate
 yaa phir hindu yuva vahini ke pradesh adhyaksh or bahubali ajay singh kii patni kavita singh ko
 Those who have been given tickets by JDU
 do gangsters kii patniyaan aamane-samnepatniyaan bhale bedaag hon magar jin patiyon kii vajah se in patniyon ko siyaasi partiyon ne tikat diya he
 He faces dozens of lawsuits such as murder, extortion and extortion
 hatya ke saat alag-alag maamalon main syed shahabuddin jail main hai
 At the same time, Ajay Singh, the face of gangster and Hinduist politics, is out of jail
 lekin unki ummidavaar par jediu ko nuksaan hone kii report thi, lihaaza unki patni ko ummidavaari di gai he
 Omprakash Yadav defeated Hina 2 times, after Laloo Yadav became the CM of Bihar, Mohammad Shahabuddin ruled this seat
 1992 se shuru hui unki jeet kaa silsilaa 2004 tak chalaa
 Notorious for his Bahubali image, Shahabuddin took charge when his wife Hina Shahab took charge
 haalanki shahabuddin kii ilaake par jabardast pakad hone ke baavjood hina shahaab ko kabhi jeet hasil nahin hui
 Om Prakash Yadav defeated Hina in both the 2009 and 2014 elections
 magar is baar jediu ne unki jagah gangster ajay singh kii patni ko kavita singh ko hina ke saamne utaara he
 The situation has made the politician old saying
 jis tarah loha lohe ko katata he
 Similarly, JDU has fielded this candidate in the cut of this RJD candidate
 naam he kavita singh
 Baahubali is the wife of Ajay Singh, accused in 30 serious cases like Madam kidnapping and extortion
 or darunda se vidhayak bhi
 These two women were domestic women but the situation brought them to the political arena
 patniyaan bani hai moharaye donon mahilaayein beshak siyaasi maidan main pehali baar nahin utari hai lekin ye bhi sach he ki ye donon mohara bhar hai
 The real electoral battle has been fought between their husbands
 ittefaq se donon ke patiyon ko chunaav ladane ke liye ayogy paaya gaya he
 In Siwan, the ground is again set up for the battle of supremacy between the two musclemen
 izzat se pesh aati hai hinagrejuation kii padhai ke dauraan apane college main burka pahanakar jane vaali hina kii shaadi college se nikalate hi shahabuddin se hui
 Hina, a mother of two daughters and a son, and despite being shy by nature, arrives in her territory wearing a burqa
 magar shahabuddin kii tarah dabangai nahin dikhaati hai
 Rather, i respect the opponents
 chunaav prachaar main jhonki taqatgel main jane ke baad siwan main shahabuddin kaa khauf ghatana shuru ho gaya tha
 It seemed that now the rule of Bahubalis in Siwan has been talked about in the past
 lihaaza is baar shahabuddin ne siwan main apni khoi zamin hasil karne ke liye puraa jor laga diya he
 Hina is also campaigning vigorously in the parliamentary constituency
 udhar, kavita singh ne bhi morcha sambhaal rakhaa he
 Overall, one thing is certain, whether Kavita Singh wins or Hina Shahab from here in 2019
 sansad main siwan kaa pratinidhitiv koi baahubal hi karegaa
 After putting out half the team of the West Indies, the rain put a break on India's progress in the second Test cricket match
 tej gendbaaj ishanth sharma ne match ke duusare din subah do wicket jaldi nikaalkar bharat kii sthiti majboot kar di thi, lekin barish ke kaaran buudhvaar ko keval 25
 Only 3 overs were played
 jab ampiron ne barish nahin thamane ke kaaran din kaa khel samaapt ghoshit kiya, tab westeindies kaa score paanch wicket par 98 ran tha
 India scored 201 runs in their first innings and thus they are still 103 runs ahead of the Caribbean team
 westeindies ke anbhavi ballebaaj shivnarayan chandrapal (naabad 20) haalanki abhi krij par date hue hai
 With him at the other end is the talented Malren Samuels playing 21 runs
 westeindies kii aadhi team 57 ran tak pavilion laut gai thi, jiske baad in donon ne ab tak chathe wicket ke liye 41 ran jod liye hai
 If Ishant's name was given in the morning session on the second day of the match, then the rest of the two seasons saw rain and the players spent most of their time in the dressing room
 ishanth ne pehle satr main bharat ko do safaltaaen dilaain
 He has taken three wickets for 31 runs so far, while Praveen Kumar and Abhimanyu Mithun have got one wicket each
 westeindies ne duusare din teen wicket par 30 ran se aage khelnaa shuru kiya
 Ishant then dismissed the two first-day unbeaten batsmen, Knightwatchman Debendra Bishu (13) and veteran Ramnaresh Sarwan (18), sending the Caribbean team to the backfoot
 ishanth ne din ke chathe over main pehle bishu ko pavilion bheja, jo teji se uthati gend ko nahin samaj paae or gali main viraat kohli ko aasaan kaich de baithe
 He then lbw out Sarwan on the last ball of the over
 sarwan phulalength gend par apane footwork kaa istemaal nahin kar paae or wicket ke thik aage gend unke pad se takaraa gai
 Chanderpaul also had trouble facing Ishant and Praveen's impressive bowling, but he, along with Samuels, did not allow the team to take any further blows
 sampuls ko khaataa kholane ke liye intjaar karnaa padaa, lekin iske baad unhone puure vishwaas ke saath gendbaajon kaa saamana kiya
 India are leading 1-0 in a three-match series by winning the first Test match played at Kingston by 63 runs
 aapako bataa den, jiskaa naam is register main shaamil hota he use kisi bhi park main jane kii aazaadee nahin hoti or na hi kisi skool, college yaa kisi bhi aisi jagah jahaan zyada log hote hai vahaan jane kii ijaajat nahin hoti he
 Not only this, he will also be placed under house arrest from 9 am to 7 am for 3 months
 dekha jaae to britain main lau kaaphi sakht hai
 But this time the boy was sentenced to a small sentence, not sending him to jail
 aapako ek or baat bataa den ki bhale hi film ke nirmaataa nirdeshak yaa iske star hindi film industry ke hon, lekin film hindi main nahin, punjabi main he
 More than 90% of the dialogues in it are in Punjabi and hence English sub titles have been added to the film
 phir bhi aap is film ko ek baar dekhiye kyonki 'udata punjab' kam se kam ek baat to sikhaati he ki drugs ke daldal main jaan-boojhkar ghuso yaa anjaane main, anjaam bahut hi bura hota he
 So my rating for 'udta Punjab' is 3
 5 star

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is in a dilemma over the option of a fourth bowler in the World Cup final against Sri Lanka on Saturday
 unhone kaha ki team prabandhan abhi tay nahin kar paaya he ki spinner ko lenaa he yaa tej gendbaaj ko
 Swing bowler Ashish Nehra will not be able to play Friday's match due to a finger fracture
 aise main tej gendbaaj es srisanth or of spinner aar aswin ke bich main se chayan hona he
 Dhoni said, Ashish has multiple fractures in his finger, so he will not be able to play
 unhone kaha, mumbai kii wicket par tej gendbaajon ko shuruuaat main oochaal or gati milti he or baad main reverse swing bhi
 In such a situation, the third fast bowler can prove useful
 dhoni ne kaha, yadi main spinner ko chunata hum to aniyamit dhime gendbaajon ke rahete hue team main adhik badlaav kii gunjaaish nahin rahati
 However, whatever chance Ashwin got, he did well
 hamen us par bharosa he lekin abhi yah tay nahin hua he ki kal teen tej gendbaaj khelenge yaa ek atirikt spinner
 Sreesanth has not played any match since the first match against Bangladesh on 19 February
 aise main lambey brake ke baad lay kaise hasil karenge, yah poochne par dhoni ne kaha ki yadi final ko ek saamaanya match kii tarah hi mana jaye to koi mushkil nahin hogi
 Dhoni said, it should not be seen as a common match but a final
 srisanth ne adhikansh maichon main acha pradarshan kiya he
 He gets swing as well as early wickets
 ek khilaadi ko duusare par tarjeeh dena mushkil hota he lekin ummid karte hai ki jise bhi chunaa jayega, vah apana sarvshereshth pradarshan karegaa
 He said, we could not give him much opportunity
 pehle match main bhi usne kharaab gendbaaji nahin kii
 After that we gave opportunities to others
 yah dekhnaa hota he ki halaat kiske anukool hai
 Asked about Sreesanth's attitude on the field, he said, only Sreesanth can control Sreesanth
 yah mere bas kii baat nahin
 He gets thrilled in big matches
 dhoni ne sweekaar kiya ki pakistan ke khilaaf semifinal ke baad team thakee hui he lekin unhone kaha ki final or semifinal main adhik antar nahin hone kii unhen khushi he
 Dhoni said, it was a big match
 bharat or pakistan ke mukaable bade hi hote hai kyonki isamen tiimon par kaaphi dabaav hota he
 We are tired after the semi-finals but have made full use of the next two days
 ummid he ki final main sarvshereshth pradarshan kar sakenge
 He said, the good thing is that there is not much difference between the finals and the semi-finals
 kal ham yatra kar rahe the or aaj hamane abhyaas kiya
 We are ready for the finals

 Senior BJP leader LK Advani and Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat met today in Nagpur
 adwani ne unhen apni rathyatra ke bare main jaankaree di
 On reaching Nagpur, Advani said that he had come to discuss many issues including his visit
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main pradhanmantri ke res se baahar hone ke sawaal kaa unhone sidhaa jawaab nahin diya
 He said that this is not a question based on fact
 sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki sangh adwani kii rathyatra se khush nahin he, kyonki isse pradhanmantri pad kii unki daavedaari ko lekar party ke bheetar phir se charchaa shuru ho jaaegi, jabaki sangh kisi yuva netaa ko project karnaa chahta he
 Therefore, it is believed that Advani should announce before his visit that he is not in the race for the post of Prime Minister, starting on October 11

 tippaniyan Recalling Prime Minister Modi's statement that 70 years after the independence of the country, the era of poverty eradication has passed and now is the time to eradicate poverty, Akbar said that we have a big challenge to eradicate poverty from the country

 Do you want to be Miss Universe? Why? Because i like modeling a lot
 main bharat kaa naam roshan karnaa chaahati hum or desh ke liye kuch karnaa chaahati hum
 How did the girl become mentally prepared to become a bride? i knew what the bride and groom were? i had read the script carefully and knew what i had to do
 nirdeshkon ne samaj bhi diya tha
 Papa also helped a lot and people liked my work
 ji haa, bal vivaah ke bare main pehle pataa nahin tha
 Had read about this in the fifth class when it was known that all this still goes on
 lekin meraa maananaa he ki bal vivaah nahin hona chahielagta he, jaise aapkaa bachapan khatm ho gaya? kitne ghante kaam karti hai?aisa nahin lagata kyonki shooting karnaa meri hobbi he
 Working hours depend on how much scene to do? By the way, big scenes are on saturday-sunday
 parade par sabase zyada ronaa kis drishy main aayaa?jab mujhe or jagaya ko alag kar diya tha, tab sabase zyada roi thi
 i shed a lot of tears
 vaise zyada fark nahin padaa kyonki jagaya yani avinaash mere hi skool main he
 i also get real tears when i think what she would have done if all this was really happening to Avika
 vaise asal jivan main kabhi nahin roti
 What did you learn from the role of a girl bride? My father teaches that every moment should live freely, make its own way and learn better from the past and make the future even better
 aisa to nahin ki anandi ko ghamand aa jayega?nahin, aisa kabhi nahin hoga
 What is your dream? Becoming Miss Universe, becoming a successful actress in Bollywood and doing studies in the field of education which is related to the film industry

 The deadline to declare the team for the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 is today i
e
 April 25
 isisi ne champions trophy main shirkat kar rahe sabhi deshon ko nirdesh die the ki wo aaj tak apni-apni team kii ghoshnaa kar den
 Almost all the countries have already selected the team
 lekin bisisiai ne na to ab tak bhartiya team kaa chayan kiya he, na hi philhal do din tak aisa karne ke mood main he
 The reason for this is the new financial model of ICC
 kya he puraa maamla ?darasal bisisiai,isisi ke nae vittiya model se sahamat nahin he
 The BCCI has also threatened to boycott the Champions Trophy in protest against this model
 is model ko lagu karne yaa na karne ko lekar antim faisla isisi kii dubai main jari baithak main hoga, jo 27 april ko khatm ho rahi he
 On the basis of the decision that will come after the end of this meeting, the BCCI will decide whether or not to select the team
 isisi kaa nae vittiya model par kyon naakhush he bisisiai?cricket kii duniya main teen deshon kaa raaj chalata he
 India, England and Australia
 in teenon desh ko cricket kaa ‘big thri’ kaha jaataa he
 Based on the icc's previous financial model, the percentage of revenue received to the Big Three was higher than the revenue percentage received to the rest of the countries
 in teen cricket board ke paas betahasha paisa hone kaa bhi yahi kaaran tha
 But now the ICC has changed this model to create a mood to equalize the revenue of each member country
 bisisiai iske virodh main he
 He argues that these three countries give cricket the highest profits, the highest popularity and the most benefits from other items, so the ICC should not be harmed in giving them some additional benefits
 kashmir se dhara 370 hataae jane ko lekar desh bhar main raajnneetik maahaul lagaataar garm bana hua he
 The Kashmir Reorganization Bill brought by Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Parliament was strongly opposed by all opposition parties including Congress, RJD
 ab dhara 370 ko lekar bihar main bhi bayaanbaji shuru ho gai he, jisaki vajah bihar ke up-mukhyamantri susheel modi kaa twit he
 Sushil Modi tweeted, "dr
 ambedkar ne jammu-kashmir main dhara 370 lagane kaa virodh kiya tha or is dhara ke chalate us simavarti rajya main na mandal ayog kii report lagu ho paayi, na daliton-pichhadon ko rigerveshan kaa laabh mil paaya
 Why is the party of Lalu Prasad, who became the Messiah of the Reservation, opposing the decision of the government, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi cleared the way for reservation by ending a temporary stream that stained Kashmir
 argedy ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh shivanand tiwari ne susheel modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki lagata he susheel modi ne pragna thakur ke skool main daakhila le liya he or vahiin se pard kar wo kah rahe hai ki babasahab ambedkar kashmir ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene vaale samvidhan ke anuchhed 370 ke virodh main the
 He said that the overall writing, speeches, interviews, letter-sheets etc
 of Babasaheb have been published by the Government of Maharashtra in 17 sections, there is no opposition to Article 370 anywhere
 shivanand tiwari ne bijepi par tikhaa hamalaa karte hue kaha, "sardaar patel ko lekar bhi susheel modi kii party hallaa machaati he
 It is rumored that Sardar Patel was opposed to Article 370 and it was only because of former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru that this Article was included in the Constitution that nothing could be a bigger lie than this
 tathy yah he ki 15 or 16 may, 1949 ko is silsile kii pehali baithak sardaar patel ke hi ghar par hui thi
 Apart from Sardar Patel, Nehruji, Sheikh Abdullah and Kashmir Minister Mr
 Iyengar were also present in that meeting and Article 370 was agreed to in this meeting ”
 argedy ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh shivanand tiwari ne dhara 370 ke bachaav main kaha ki "purv pradhanmantri jawahar-laal nehru kii gaiyrhaaziri main sardaar patel ke hi netritv main samvidhan sabha se anuchhed 370 paarit hua tha
 Article 370 was the bridge through which Kashmir was connected with us
 sabakaa saath or sabko vishwaas main lekar sarkaar chalaane kaa daawa karne vaali modi sarkaar dwaara kashmir ko jailkhana main tabdeel kar 370 ko hataaya gaya he
 There is no news coming out, lies are being spread in the country about Kashmir
 " Exactly a week later Panneerselvam returned to Jayalalithaa's tomb again on Tuesday night
 is dauraan unke saath jayalalita kii bhatiji deepa jayakumar bhi saath thim
 Deepa is the daughter of Jayalalithaa's brother
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki shashikala kii vajah se hi unka parivaar jayalalita se alag rahaa
 Sasikala was with Jayalalithaa for many years
 jayalalita kaa disambar main nidhan ho gaya tha
 Today, the Supreme Court has sentenced Sasikala to 4 years in the case of disproportionate assets
 haalanki unhone abhi tak sarender nahin kiya he
 Seven days ago Panneerselvam reached the tomb of Jayalalithaa, located in Marine Beach
 vahaan akele main kuch der tak dhyaan kiya tha
 Stayed there for about 40 minutes
 is dauraan badi taadaad main annadramuk kaaryakarta or anya log unhen dekhne ke liye jamaa ho gaye the
 Later, while talking to the media, it was because of the spirit that the soul was suffering, so came here
 unhone kaha tha ki unki aatma ne unhen mukhyamantri bane rahane ke liye kaha he
 The comments jayalalita kii maut ke baad se tamilnadu main siyaasi ghamaasan machaa hua he
 While Panneerselvam has resigned, his party mlas are angry at Sasikala's capture of the party
 haalanki deepa abhi eidiemke kii sadsy nahin hai lekin unhone ghoshnaa kii thi ki vah apni buaa jayalalita kii rajviraasat sanbhaalengi
 On the other hand, after being convicted by the Supreme Court in a disproportionate assets case, Sasikala has claimed to make her confidant Palaniswami the leader of the AIADMK legislature party
 yani paroksh rup se shashikala ediemke kii bagdor apane haath main rakhengi
 Not only this, Sasikala camp has shown Panneeselvam the way out of the party
 aaj shaam donon pakshon ne governor se milakar sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya he

 Since Jayalalithaa's death, there has been a political uproar in Tamil Nadu
 ek ore jahaan panniraselvam ne istipha de diya he, vahiin unki party ke vidhayak shashikala dwaara party par kabja jamaaye jane se naaraaz hai
 Though Deepa is not yet a member of the AIDMK, she had announced that she would take over the legacy of her aunt Jayalalithaa

 Chidambaram was concerned about whether he would be able to get political support to take the necessary reformist steps necessary for economic revival
 vidambnaa yah ki unhen sonia gandhi kaa samarthan hasil kar lene kaa to puraa bharosa tha, lekin ve is baat par aashwast nahin the ki pradhanmantri iske liye unka samarthan karenge
 "chidambaram's concern was whether the prime minister had the political hunger to take risks during the last slack phase of his tenure, as in the days of the nuclear deal," a senior official said
 ’’ 1 agast ko pad grahan karne ke baad chidambaram ne vitt mantralay ke adhikariyon se kaha tha ki kaam karne ke liye unke paas ek maheene kaa honeymoon (khushnuma) daur he
 According to the sources, the worried Chidambaram had told the officials, "I will have to bear the penalty for the mess that has been inherited after this, whether it is inflation or financial loss
" ’’kendriya vitt mantri ke rup main apni duusari pari ke do maah puure hone ke baad 8 aktubar ko jab chidambaram nai dilli main sarkaar ke vaarshik aarthik sampadakon ke vaarshik sammelan ko sambodhit karne baithe to aatmavishvaas se labarej dikh rahe the
 There was nothing to hesitate for him
 vitt mantri ne apane chote honeymoon daur ke liye jo kuch bhi tay kiya tha, vah sab hasil kar liya tha
 "several steps have been taken in the last few weeks to get rid of the feeling of inactivity and to achieve the target of high growth rate again
" ’’unke kaarybhaar grahan karne ke pehle aath hafton main hi sarkaar ne kai bade sudhaarwadi upayon kii ghoshnaa kii he: multi-brands retail or aviation main epadi dijal-alpiji sabsidi ko tarksangat bananaa
 It could not stop even the political blackmail of Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee
 upie se unke baahar nikalne se sarkaar ko apana yah iraadaa jaahir karne kii himmat mil gai ki arase se lambit beemaa kshetra main epadi seemaa badhaane or pension main epadi kii ijaajat dene jaise anya sudhaarwadi upayon ko bhi sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main aage badhaayaa jayega
 Eventually the government was freed from the state of policy paralysis of 18 months
 pradhanmantri ke daahine haatchidambaram ne sudhaar kii jarurat ko congress ke saamne uthayapradhanmantri kii rajnatik ichhashakti sambandhi chidambaram kii chintaa niraadhaar sabit hui
 Some officials say that preparations for gradual reformist announcements were made on June 27, when Pranab Mukherjee resigned from the post of finance minister and stepped down for the presidential election
 manmohan singh fouran chidambaram ko vitt mantri bananaa chaahate the, lekin congress ke ranneetikaron ne unhen salaah di ki ve raashtrapati chunaav khatm hone tak intjaar karen
 It is not hidden that Manmohan Singh and Pranab Mukherjee had differences over economic policies
 jab aarthik vruddhi kii dar kam hokar varsh 2011-12 main 6
 4 per cent and 5 in the first quarter of 2012-13
 5 fisadi par aa gai to manmohan ko sudhaar karnaa jaruri lagane laga
 According to officials, Manmohan agreed to the reforms, but he was not satisfied that the Congress party would support him in this matter
 sudhaaron kii jarurat par party ko manaane ke liye unhen chidambaram jaise vitt mantri kii jarurat thi
 "chidambaram and the Prime Minister have a kind of economic thinking, but unlike the Prime Minister, Chidambaram is articulate in this matter and is ready to confront the party's old known leaders," said an official
 ’’chidambaram kii ek or khubi congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se unki kareebi he
 a source said, "chidambaram has become closer to Mrs Gandhi even more than the tenure of his home minister
 ’’ chidambaram ne sudhaarwadi upayon par congress or gandhi parivaar kaa puri tarah se or kaaphi khulkar samarthan hasil kar liya
 This cannot be called a small achievement
 ek adhikari kehete hai, ‘‘general to pradhanmantri hi hai, lekin sena kaa netritv chidambaram ne hi kiya he
 "one of the things that Chidambaram wants to keep away from in his new innings as a recognized minister, Chidambaram in his old form, is a humble finance minister who recognizes the challenges
 His noted intellectual arrogance
" 8 aktubar ko aarthik sampadakon ke sammelan main ve behad chaturaai se bhavishya main badhat yaa mahangaai ke liye kisi nishchit aankade kaa anumaan jari karne ke jaal main nahin fanse

C
 rangarajan is maamle main apni kaaphi saakh ganvaa chuke hai
 Chidambaram knows that the goal of bringing economic growth back into a fast phase is difficult and dramatic measures will not work
 unhone jis din sampadakon ke sammelan ko sambodhit kiya, uske agle hi din iemef ne 2012 ke liye bharat ke vikaas anumaan ko ghataakar 4

 agle chah maheene main mahangaai ghatane kii sambhaavnaaon ko lekar bhi vitt mantri kaaphi sachet hai
 They understand very patiently that inflation can increase due to two reasons: first, the demand is very high and supply is low compared to it (this is the main reason for the sharp rise in prices of agricultural commodities) and second, the government than the revenue Excess expenditure, which forces the government to borrow, thus adds more money to the economy, which leads to inflation
 unhone sweekaar kiya ki in donon sthitiyon se nibatane ke liye koi taatkaalik samaadhaan nahin he
 When a journalist insisted on a hike in prices, Chidambaram said, "if you have an immediate solution, i would be happy to talk to you about it
" ’’chidambaram dhire-dhire retrospective (puraani tithi se lagu hone vaale) tex sudhaar se hue nuksaan kii bharpai karne main lage hai
 Mukherjee brought this tax system in the budget presented in February
 unhone upie1 ke daur ke apane salaahkaar parthasarathi som kii sevaayen leen or unhen retrospective tex ke maamle main suzav dene ke liye bani ek samiti kaa pramukh banaaya
 The committee has suggested that the retrospective tax regime should be scrapped
 lekin iske liye sansad se manjuuri lenaa jaruri he
 Chidambaram wants to avoid it
 ek adhikari ne bataaya, ‘‘chidambaram aisa rasta nikaalane kii koshish kar rahe hai jiske liye sansad se manjuuri kii jarurat na pade
 The Som Committee has also suggested that no penalty or interest should be levied in retrospective tax cases
 isse vodaphone ko bhi nunatam jurmaana lekar raahat di ja sakati he
 The future prime minister Chidambaram can be a top contender with the help of his friends
 The next task in Chidambaram's agenda is to help allies and the opposition to get the bills passed
 sudhaar kii gati banaae rakhane ke liye unhen beemaa, pension or nae company bill ko sansad ke sheet satr main paarit karana hoga jo november ke antim hafte se shuru ho saktaa he
 According to officials, Chidambaram has met Arun Jaitley to gain support on these bills
 jetali se chidambaram kii ghanishthata ke bare main sabko pataa he
 But the question is whether Jaitley himself has the ability to convince various BJP leaders in terms of economic reforms
 isamen chidambaram kii pariksha ho jaaegi
 Unlike Pranab Mukherjee, Chidambaram does not have a close relationship with the leaders of the opposition or allies
 unhen jetali ke alaava or duusare dost bhi banane honge
 Chidambaram has said that he will soon talk to allies in this matter
 lekin diemke netaa em
 Apart from Karunanidhi and ncp's Sharad Pawar, he has no close ties with regional leaders
 udhaaharan ke liye raashtrapati ke namakan main pranab mukherjee ke samarthan par upie ke sahyogi dalon ko dhanyavad dene ke liye jab july main sonia gandhi ne unhen dopaher bhoj diya to chidambaram sapa netaa mulaayam singh kii bagal main hi baithe hue the
 But there was hardly any talk other than the usual formality
 chidambaram ke liye ab sirf arthvyavastha ko ubaarana hi nahin balki kaaphi kuch daanv par laga hua he
 After Pranab Mukherjee, Chidambaram's sense in Congress and government has suddenly increased
 aadhikarik rup se antni number do ho sakate hai, lekin vyaavhaarik rup se is jagah par chidambaram hi hai
 As the head of the gom, he appears in the media as the chief troubleshooter of the government
 ab yah saaf he ki manmohan ko agle aam chunaav main congress pradhanmantri ke chehre kii tarah nahin pesh karne vaali he
 If Rahul Gandhi refuses to replace Manmohan, Chidambaram may appear as the prime ministerial contender with Antony
 ve yadi sudhaar ke bhimkaay rath ko khinchne main safal rahete hai to unki sambhaavna or majboot ho jaaegi
 The need for running on top gear is too short for a real change
 At the Economic Editors' Conference, Chidambaram has promised to tell the people of India the truth
 abhi tak unhone kaaphi had tak aisa nahin kiya he
 Like their predecessors, they too are blaming the adverse situation in the global economy for the difficulty of the Indian economy
 unhone yah sweekaar karne kaa saahas nahin kiya he ki kaaphi had tak yah durdasha unki apni sarkaar kii vajah se hi he
 Chidambaram is also well aware that according to the recommendations of the committee headed by his trusted economist Vijay Kelkar, reducing the fiscal deficit is not an easy task
 vitt mantri ne garibon ke liye khaadya, urvarak or eendhan par sabsidi kaa bachaav kiya he
 Overall they are simply promising that the government will reduce leakage by giving cash through the Aadhaar network
 nandan nilekani ke netritv vaale aadhaar project ke gunon ke bare main chidambaram kaa yah taatkaalik bayaan vilakshan hi kaha ja saktaa he, yah dekhte hue ki grih mantri ke apane kaarykaal ke dauraan unhone zyaadaatar samay iskaa virodh kiya tha
 It seems that he is willing to cooperate with an organization that can be very helpful in his work as finance minister, keeping his ego aside
 chidambaram ke liye asli chintaa kii baat yah he ki kya asal main badlaav laane ke liye unke paas paryaapt samay bachaa he
 Even if the government completes its term, they will get only 19 months
 ek adhikari kehete hai, ‘‘is baat kii aadhi sambhaavna hi he ki bache hue samay main oonchi vruddhi dar, zyada naukariyon ke srijan or mahangaai ghataane ke maamle main asal badlaav laayaa ja sake
 "what is even more worrying is that Chidambaram may not get even a full 19 months
 ve charchaa ke vishay ko bhrashtachar se hataakar sudhaar kii taraf le jane ke liye apana ji-jaan laga hi rahe the ki 5 aktubar ko arvind kejariwal ne robert wadra ke khilaaf aniyamitata kaa aarope lagaakar unke is prayaas ko jabardast jhatka de diya
 The government has had to remove its feet from the paddle of reforms because now all its energy has been spent in saving the prestige of the first family of Congress
 ek afasarshah kehete hai, ‘‘wadra ke bare main khulaasa haal main aage badaye gaye sudhaaron ke liye avrodh jaisaa he
 Nevertheless, the determined Chidambaram will do his best to step forward
 lekin shaayad vah congress ko lagaataar teesri baar satta main laane ke liye kaaphi na ho
 -with Priya Sehgal jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay (jeenyu) main desh virdohi naare lagane ke aaropee kanhaiya kumaar, umr khalid or anirbaan samet anya ke maamle main dilli police kii chargeshit par apana paksh rakhane ke liye kejariwal sarkaar ne court se 2 maheene kaa vakt maanga he
 During the hearing on Monday in the Patiala House Court, the Delhi Government presented its stand
 dilli sarkaar ke vakeelon ne court ko bataaya ki unhen 2 maheene kaa vakt yah tay karne ke liye chahie ki dilli police kii chargeshit par vah apana apruval de yaa phir use riject kare
 However, the court is unhappy with the attitude of Delhi Police and the government
 is maamle main dilli police kii taraf se 3 saal ke baad janvari main chargeshit daakhil kii gai thi
 But even 2 months after the filing of the charge sheet, the court has not been able to take cognizance of it
 kyonki dilli sarkaar kii taraf se isko hari jhandi nahin mili he
 For this reason, despite the filing of charge sheet in this case, neither the charges have been framed nor the trial of the case has started
 court ne dilli police se kaha he ki maamle se jude tamaam video court ko supurd kiye jaaen taaki unhen dekh kar mukadmaa shuru karne kii prakriya shuru ho
 The court will now hold its next hearing on 27 March
 dilli police ne patiala house court main jo chargeshit daakhil kii he, usamen kanhaiya kumaar, umr khalid, anirbaan ke alaava 7 kashmiri chaatro ko aaropee banaaya gaya he
 The Delhi Police has stated in the charge sheet that either these people shouted seditious slogans in JNU or they were supporting those who shouted slogans
 police ne court ko 56 aise chaatro kii suchi bhi di thi jinke khilaaf sidhe aarope to nahin hai lekin police ko shaq he ki vah desh virdohi naare lagane main apratyaksh rup se shaamil the
 After taking almost 2 months time from the Delhi government and from the court, it is clear that the trial in this case may take some more time
 haalanki dilli police ne court main sarkaar par aarope lagaaya he ki vah lagaataar maamle ko or lanbaa khinchne ke liye samay le rahi he
 In such a situation, it is possible that on the next hearing, by watching the video recording of the incident in JNU, the court should take a decision for early hearing of the case

 (input bhashaa se) The sale of rose flowers in Khanderarao Market in Vadodara, Gujarat was suddenly stopped by the Municipal Corporation
 isse gussaye kisaanon ne sadak par gulab ke phool phenk apana virodh jataayaa
 Actually, the farmers of the village located near Vadodara have been living in the market here for years and making a living
 haalanki vadodara nagar nigam ne achaanak hi bina koi vajah bataae, yahaan par phool bechney par roak laga di
 Annoyed with this kind of hardship on their livelihood, the farmers protested and threw more than 500 kg of rose on the road
 bataa den kigulab kii fasalmen kisaan sirf raat ke vakt phool ko kheton se todane kaa kaam karata he or soobah jaldi in phulon ko bazaar laakar bechate hai, taaki logon ke gharon tak taaja phool pahunch jaae
 But with this ban imposed by the corporation, these rose farmers are seeing their business collapse
 kisaanon kaa kahana he ki vah saalon se sirf isi jagah par baith kar apana vyapaar chalaa rahe hai
 In such a situation, he cannot change his place and cause his loss

 america ke nav-nirvaachit raashtrapati donald trump apane cabinet ke saathiyon kii list banane main jute gaye hai
 Trump has chosen James Mattis as defense minister
 is bare main aupchaarik elaan agle hafte hone kii ummid he
 Trump met Mattis two weeks ago, and the next day, Trump praised him
 trump ne nae raksha mantri ke naam kaa khulaasa karte hue twit kiya ki raksha mantri ke pad ke liye general james 'mad dog' ke naam par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Trump's tweet used a term that produces curiosity
 aakhir trump ne mattis ke liye 'mad dog' kaa istemaal kyon kiya?66 saal ke janaralgems mattis kaa namaunaki peedi ke sabase zyada sammanit afasaron main shumaar he
 Mattis retired from the US Army in 2013 after nearly four decades of service in the Marine Corps
 iske baad se wo stenford ke pratishthit hover santhaan main think-tanks scollar or kai privet companiyon main bataur board member kaam kar rahe hai
 Language is aggressive Mattis has been a strategic thinker, due to his aggressive language, he has been in controversies many times
 2005 main san diyaago main ek panel discusan ke dauraan mattis ne kaha tha, 'kuch logon ko goli maarna mjedaar lagata he' or 'main kalah pasand karata hum'
 These words of Mattis raised the eyebrows of the then Marine Commandant General Michael Heiji
 mattis ne kabhi kaha tha, 'vinamr bano, profeshnal bano, lekin us har shaks ko maarane kaa plan bhi dimag main rakho jisase tum milte ho
 Like Trump, Mattis is also a tough-witted figure towards America's enemies, especially Iran
 mattis kaa kahana he ki obama prashasan kii ore se parmaanu samjhaute par dastakhat karne se parmaanu hathiyaar hasil karne kii iran kii laalasaa kam to hogi lekin ham use aisa karne se roak nahin paaenge
 In the destruction of the enemy, surety is also called 'warrior Monk' in addition to 'mad Dog'
 beete 20 varshon ke dauraan general mattis ne america sena ke behad ahm oparations kii aguwai kii
 In November 2001, Mattis led commandos of US Marines as One Star General
 in commando ne afghanistan ke qandahar praant main helicopteron se hamalaakar aatankwaadiyon ke thikaane tabah kar die the
 It was America's first biggest success against the Taliban after the 9 / 11 attacks
 2003 main mattis ne iraq par america hamale ke dauraan marine forcej kii ek tukdi kii aguwai kii thi
 The same year, under the leadership of Mattis, the US Marines fought fiercely in the city of Fazulla
 
 
 
 But even this legal screw, however, the appointment of Mattis to the post of Defense Minister is not so easy
 america kanoon ke mutabik pichley saat varshon ke dauraan military main rahe kisi shaks ko civilayan post par nahin rakhaa ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, the US Congress will not seal the name of Mattis unless the law is amended
 aisa pehali baar nahin ho rahaa he jab kisi ritred military afasar ko saat saal ke bheetar itani badi jimmedaari di ja rahi he
 In 1950, General George C
 Marshall was also made the Defense Minister of the United States
