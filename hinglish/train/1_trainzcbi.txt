 bhartiya janata party ke kaddavar netaaon main kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh kaa bhi naam aata he
 At present, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah, he is considered the most powerful and powerful leader in the party
 unke raajnneetik kad kaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki atal bihari vaajapeyi or laal krishnu adwani ke baad aise netaa hai jo party kii kaman do baar sambhaal chuke hai
 In such a situation, people will also have an eye on Rajnath Singh in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 banaras ke paas chandauli jile main janme rajnath singh ek kushal prashaasak ke rup main jane jate rahe hai
 Rajnath has been a professor in the college of Mirzapur before stepping into politics
 lekin bachapan se sangh ke angan main paley bade hai
 Rajnath's close association with the RSS, known as the bjp's mother organization, is well known
 aresas ke saath unke behatar rishte kaa anumaan is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki adwani ke jinna prakaran ke baad sangh ne rajnath ko hi party ke adhyaksh ke rup main jimmedaari saunpi thi
 After this, for the second time, the command of BJP was taken over by Rajnath Singh when Nitin Gadkari's name appeared in the Purti case
 dilachasp baat ye he ki rajnath singh ne adhyakshakaal main hi 2013 main pradhanmantri pad ke liye narendra modi ke naam par muhar lagi thi
 Although many party leaders did not agree on this, Rajnath Singh has come forward and extended his name
 10 july 1951 ko janme rajnath ne gorakhpur vishvavidhyalay se bhautikee vishay main prost grajuation kii degree hasil kii he
 He was then appointed Professor at KB Degree College in 1971
 immergency ke dauraan kai maheenon tak jail main band rahane vaale rajnath singh ko 1975 main jan sangh ne mirzapur jile kaa adhyaksh banaaya
 Rajnath Singh's decision even today is worthy of praise for the work done as Education Minister in Uttar Pradesh
 1991 main unhone bataur shiksha mantri anti-coping act lagu karavaaya tha
 Also, the credit for including Vedic Mathematics in the curriculum also goes to them
 rajnath singh 20 oktober 2000 main rajya ke mukhyamantri bane
 However his tenure lasted less than 2 years
 centre main jab vaajapeyi kii aguwai vaali endie kii sarkaar bani tab rajnath singh ko krishi mantri banaaya gaya tha
 After this, in 2014, when Narendra Modi's government was formed, he became the Home Minister of the country

 aaj sabase tej gati se railway kaa vikaas kaary ho rahaa he
 Today we are building houses for the poor at the fastest speed
 aaj desh main sabase tej gati se mobile manufeccharing unit lagane kaa kaary hua he
 Today, the work of laying the optical fiber network is going on at the fastest speed in the country
 aaj desh main sabase tej gati se epadiai aa rahi he
 Today, the scope of cleanliness is increasing at the fastest pace in the country

 He said, 'you must have seen the condition of the Food Security Act in the previous government
 khub ho-hallaa machaakar ise laayaa gaya
 When my government came, i was stunned to see that this Act has been implemented in only 11 states
 hamaari sarkaar ne desh ke sabhi rajyon or centre shasit pradeshon main is kanoon ko lagu kiya
 2014 to 2019 was the time to fulfill the requirements, while from 2019 onwards there is an opportunity to fulfill the aspirations
 2014 se 2019 buniyadi jaruraton ko har ghar tak pahunchane kaa samay tha, jabaki 2019 se aage tej unnati ke liye udaan bharne kaa avasar he
 ' kendriya grih mantri susheel kumaar scindia ne spasht kiya ki vivaadaaspad ensitisi (rashtriya aatankwaad rodhi kendra) un mukhyamantriyon se bhaleebhanti charchaa ke baad hi banaaya jayega, jo iskaa virodh kar rahe hai
 Shinde said, 'I am looking into this issue in detail
 main rajyon, mukhyamantriyon se baat karnaa chaahunga
 It is a good move but we will have to talk to the Chief Ministers
 ’pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee, odisha ke naveen patnayak, tamilnadu kii mukhyamantri je jayalalita ke kade virodh ke kaaran grih mantralay ne ensitisi kii yojana main sanshodhan kiya
 NCTC was the favorite project of former Home Minister p Chidambaram
 nayi yojana ke tahat ensitisi ko khufia beuro ke daayre main rakhaa jayega or yah swatantra agency hogi, jo sidhe grih mantralay ko report karegi
 Apart from the Anti Terrorism Unit, it will also take action on its own in some cases, but where there is an urgent need or emergency

 bhartiya antariksh anusandhan sanghathan (ISRO) ne jab 22 july ko safaltaapurvak apane duusare moon mishan chandrayan-2 ko launch kiya to puri duniya ke vibhinn virgon se badhai mili
 Shankaracharya Nischalananda Saraswati of Govardhan Math located at Puri also welcomed ISRO scientists
 media main khabaren chal rahi hai ki isro vaigyanikon ne chandrayan-2 ke launch main ho rahi dikkaton ko dur karne ke liye shankaracharya nishchalanand saraswati se salaah lee
 On the advice of Shankaracharya Nischalananda Saraswati, the scientists solved their problem with Vedic mathematics
 media main chal rahi khabaron kii maane to isro vaigyanikon ne chandrayan-2 ke laanch se pehle july maheene main swami nishchalanand saraswati se paraamarsh liya tha
 This was done to clear some doubts which scientists did not even have solution at that time
 shankaracharya ke anusaar, vishnu puraana (vishnu Puran) or shrimad bhagavat gita (shrimad Bhagwat Geeta) main chandramaa se jal or prithvi kaa mahatvapurn sambandh he
 According to the Mahabharata (the sixth of the eighteen books) Bhishma Parva, the diameter of the moon is 11,000 yojana (1 yojana = about 12
 2 kimi) he
 It has a perimeter of 33,000 plans
 is hisaab se chandramaa kaa vyas ho jaataa he - 134,200 kimi or paridhi he 402,600 kimi
 While you search the diameter of the moon on the Internet, the answer will be 3,474
 2 kimi or paridhi 10,921 kimi
 Mathematics is difficult to understand here
 lekin aap yah jaan len ki aakhir kya sach main isro vaigyanik swami nishchalanand ke paas samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye gaye the
 No
 
 
 isro vaigyanik swami nishchalanand ke paas nahin gaye thejab AAJTAK
 The truth was revealed when the IN asked the highly placed sources of Govardhan Math in Puri about this
 sutron ne bataaya ki vaigyanik maharaj se milane aate hai
 However, no scientists came from ISRO regarding Chandrayaan-2
 ye baat alag he ki do saal pehle isro ke ahmedabad centre main shankaracharya nishchalanand saraswati ji kaa lacture tha
 In this, he explained the importance of Vedic mathematics
 swami ji ne bataaya tha ki kaise sanathan vaidic arya siddhant hi aaj ke vigyaan ko or aage le ja saktaa he
 Vedic mathematics is necessary for this
 vaidic ganit kii madad se isro ke vaigyanik desh, kaal or vastu kaa aankalan karke apane mishan ko safal bana sakate hai
 Here Swami Nischalananda ji said that today we are making a lot of instruments, but the most excellent machine is the one which has Medha Shakti, Pragya Shakti, Prana Shakti
 lekin ab tak aisa yantra maanav nahin bana paaya he
 The best tool will be the copy of human life
 lekin iske liye jaruri he ki vigyaan main vedon kii madad lee jaae
 Science is incomplete without Vedic mathematics
 veda viheen vigyaan daridrata kaa strot hota he
 But today scientists across the world are describing this science as prosperity
 shankaracharya nishchalanand saraswati vaidic ganit ke prakand vidwaan hai
 He has also written 11 books on Vedic mathematics
 iske alaava wo bark, iaiti or isro jaise sansthaanon main vaidic ganit ke mahatv par lacture dene bhi jate hai
 The NIA court on Monday ruled in the 2007 Hyderabad Mecca Masjid blast case
 court ne paryaapt saboot naa hone par aseemanand samet sabhi paanch aropiyon ko bari kar diya
 But the judge who pronounced the judgment in this case
 rabindra reddy ne kuch hi der baad apana istipha de diya
 Which shocked everyone
 lekin ab is maamle main ek or chaunkaane vaala sach saamne aayaa he
 It is being told that Krishna Reddy, a resident of Hyderabad Banjara Hills, had made a complaint against Judge Ravindra Reddy before the Chief Justice of Hyderabad High Court
 unhone aarope lagaaya tha ki jaj reddy ne jaldbaaji main jameen kabje ke maamle main ek aaropee ko bel di thi
 The petitioner had made allegations of corruption in this case
 is maamle main yachikakarta tii
 Sriranga Rao told India Today that the complaint was filed about 3 months ago, after which the Chief Justice of the High Court ordered a vigilance inquiry against Justice Reddy
 ye jaanch abhi bhi jari he
 He told that if the judge had any reason for resigning, he could have taken voluntary retirement and availed all the facilities
 lekin unhone istipha diya he to unhen ritairement ke baad kii koi suvidha nahin milegi
 According to Krishna Reddy, a man was looting him 150 crore rupees in the name of a property in Banjara Hills
 jiske baad us vyakti nejaj rabindra reddike saamne agrim jamaanat kii apil kii thi
 According to the complaint made by Krishna Reddy, during that time, Judge Reddy was incharge in court number 9 during two days 4 and 5 December
 shikaayat main unhone bataaya ki is cese kii sunwaayee 5 disambar ko kii gai or usee din bel de di gai
 According to the complaint, according to me, the Metropolitan session can give its verdict on the very next day of hearing
 lekin jaj ne usee din faisla sunaaya
 On the basis of which i said that this matter is very serious
 unhone shikaayat main kaha ki aisa lag rahaa tha ki ve bel kaa faisla dene main kaaphi jaldbaaji main the
 It was on this basis that he complained, and demanded an investigation
 aapako bataa den ki pichley kuch maheene main hi hyderabad main loar court ke teen jajon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 Currently, these judges are in judicial custody after allegations of corruption
 gauratlab he ki is faisle ke baad jaj ne jis tarah istipha diya uske baad lagaataar raajnneetik tippaniyan aa rahi thim

 They hang from the tree in Badaun

 Actually, it is also a punishment to prove what they are being given - but it is the dreaded hardship of a lagging society that wants to scare the girl

 The administration claimed to move the cattle towards Barwani through a less deep route but reached the fields outside the submergence
 gaanv waalon ko pataa laga to hangaamaa khadaa ho gaya
 Another view of the historic Rajghat, Sardar Sarovar's backwater is growing rapidly, currently there are about 30 families living in the village
 lekin ghar, ped paudhon ke saath logon ke armaan bhi narmada main dub gaye

 12 meter tak bhar diya

 Something similar happened in Indore, where three vicious persons, in the name of GST, started making illegal collection of trucks by becoming fake officers
 bataa den ki GST yani guds and sarvice tex shuukravaar raat 12 baje se puure desh main lagu hone ja rahaa he
 By taking the name of this GST, three fraudsters in Indore started recovering from cargo trucks
 manish, aditya or rakesh naam ke ye teenon shaatir maruti car se tej nagar chauraahey par petrol pump ke paas pahunche
 While there, he stopped a truck carrying plywood by parking the car
 trek indore se khandwa ja rahaa tha
 It is alleged that these three started bullying truck driver Hameed Khan, calling himself a GST officer
 pehle unhone gaadi ke kaagaj or bilti maangi
 According to Hameed Khan, he showed all the papers
 phir teenon shaatiron ne hamid khan se GST paper dikhaane ko kaha
 Hameed Khan heard about such a paper for the first time
 hamid ne kaha ki wo kya hota he? to teenon shaatir bole ki tumhen pataa nahin ki aaj raat se GST lagu ho rahaa he, uske paper kahaan hai
 When Hameed Khan said that those papers are not with him
 is par hamid khan se 1000 rupee kii maang kii jane lagi
 When Hameed Khan said that he had so much money or else he started asking for 500 rupees
 hamid khan ke mutabik teenon shaatir sharaab ke nashe main lag rahe the
 When all this was going on, a person passing by gave this information to the police
 police ke maukey par pahunchate hi teenon bhaagane lage
 One was caught by the police but two fled in a car
 police ne peechha kiya or kareeb 5 kilometre tak res lagane ke baad donon ko pakad liya
 a lawsuit was filed against the trio based on the statement of truck driver Hameed Khan

 Rajasthan Congress President Sachin Pilot arrived in Jhalawar, a stronghold of Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, on a 100-kilometer walk and held a huge Kisan Sabha
 congress kaa aarope he ki vasundhara raaje ke bete saansad dushyant singh ke loksabhaa kshetra baaraa-jhalawad main ek saal main18 kisaanon ne aatmahatyaayein keehain
 The reason for these suicides was the debt on farmers, non-availability of crops and drought
 lekin rajasthan sarkaar apni chhavi bachaane ke liye in kisaanon kii mauton ko aatmahatya maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 And they have not been given any compensation
 pradesh congress adhyaksh sachin payalat baaraa ke krishi mandi se 3 oktober ko padayatra shuru kii thi or 6 oktober ko jhalawad main 100 kilometre kii yatra puri kii
 During this padyatra, the pilots used to sleep in the village on the way and were carrying goods on bullock carts
 jhalawad main raily ke dauraan sachin payalat ne rajya main kisaanon kii purna karjamaafee kii maang ko lekar rajyabar main pradarshan jari rakhane kaa elaan kiya he
 a large number of Congress workers participated in this pilgrimage
 is maukey par sachin payalat ne aatmahatya karne vaale 18 kisaanon kii suchi bhi jari kii or inke parivaar waalon se mulaakaat bhi kii
 There is uneasiness in the BJP due to Sachin Pilot's padyatra and rally in Vasundhara Raje's stronghold
 mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje bhi teen din ke liye payalat ke loksabhaa chunaav kshetra ajmer pahunch gai hai
 On the other hand, responding to the allegations of the pilot, Agriculture Minister Prabhulal Saini said that the Congress is doing politics on the death of farmers, the farmer of Rajasthan is self-respecting and cannot die

 Emperor Salamat liked to listen to them but Zouk had a different status as a royal poet
 kaha jaataa he ki isi vajah se zuk or gaalib main 36 kaa aankada tha
 One day while Ghalib was playing gambling sitting in the market, then the convoy of Zouk came out from him
 gaalib ne tanj kasate hue kaha, 'bana he shah kaa musahib, phire he itaraata
 On this, there was a fierce fire, but he did not think it right to get down from his palanquin and face Ghalib
 unhone badshaah salaamat se unki shikaayat kar di
 The emperor asked Ghalib to appear in the court
 kair, gaalib haazir hue
 All the royal courts were present in the court
 badshaah ne gaalib se poocha ki kya miyaan zuk kii shikaayat jaays he ? gaalib ne badi chaalaaki se kaha ki jo zuk ne suna wo unki nai ghazal kaa maqta he
 On this, Emperor Salamat ordered Ghalib to present the entire ghazal at the hands
 phir kya tha
 Ghalib took out a piece of paper from his pocket, stared at it for a few moments, and then came out this classic ghazal: Every thing you say what you are you just say what is this speculation, this charisma in Han Sholay, no Tell someone in Burke that what he has seen in the video, see Najeeb Jung while talking on Ghalib aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ne kaha ki unhone varisht bijepi netaa laalkrishna adwani ke saath haal kii mulaakaat main unhen loksabhaa main vipaksh ke netaa pad se hatane kaa koi ‘‘nirdesh ’’ nahin diya
 No instructions given: Advani has already denied media reports that Bhagwat asked him to nominate his successor during the meeting
 unke spashtikaran ke baad bhagwat kii yah pehali tippanee he
 Bhagwat said, "I met Advani
" hamane kai chizon par charchaa kii, lekin maine us din koi nirdesh jari nahin kiya
 The RSS chief said that the RSS has nothing to do with the BJP

 vahiin mukhya vipakshi dal samaajawaadee party ne bhi vidhansabha main apana netaa chun liya
 However, the Congress, which won only 7 seats, has not been able to choose its leader in UP so far
 darasal, upi main congress ke 7 vidhayakon main 2 aise vidhayak hai jo duusari baar vidhansabha pahunche hai
 One of them is Ajay Singh Lallu from Kushinagar and the other is Aradhana Tiwari, daughter of Rajya Sabha MP Pramod Tiwari

 Screw is trapped here
 rahulsabhi vidhayakon se ek round mulaakaat kar bhi chuke hai or sabakaa man tatol chuke hai
 But they have not been able to decide yet
 sutara ye bhi bataate hai ki, rahul agar apni pasand thopate hai or sankhyabal ko nazarandaaj karte hai to dar ye he ki, bache-khuche vidhayak kahin party naa chhod jaaen
 After all, there is a long list of leaders leaving the party in UP and Uttarakhand
 aise main senior netaaon kii salaah par rahul koi jaldbaaji nahin karnaa chaahate
 In fact, a section of party leaders has always accused Pramod Tiwari that, for a long time, Pramod, being the leader of the Congress Legislature Party, kept close to the ruling party and not only strengthened the party
 haalanki, lagaataar chunaav jeetne kaa record banane vaale pramod tiwarisonia gandhiko baar-baar isaki safai de chuke hai, tabhi unako rajyasabha saansad banane ke liye party kaa nishaan mila tha
 Now, the anti-pramod leader is trying to convince Rahul that, making Aradhana a leader will be like putting the command in the hands of Pramod once again
 haalanki, pramod samarthakon kaa tark he ki, unki beti kaa alag vyaktitv he, wo padhi-likhi tej-tarraar or acchhee vaktaa hai or ek ko chhod sabhi vidhayak bhi unke saath hai
 On the other hand, Pramod Tiwari now wants to do politics at the Center as a Rajya Sabha MP and is in a mood to distance himself from the electoral politics of the state

 Since the matter is in the high court's court, at the moment no one wants to talk openly on this issue

 jab yah kahawat koi kahata he to uske peeche utsahit karne vaala vaakya kam sharmasaar ho jane vaali khabar zyada milti he
 One such embarrassing news happened in Chhatarpur district of Madhya Pradesh
 jahaan rape kii peedit aurat ke pati ne jab exiaar likhaanaa chaha to police ne kaaphi naa-nukur ke baad gumshudagi kii report likhi
 Although the police caught the accused but did not take any action
 jab maamla maanavadhikaar ayog pahunchaa to yahaan bhi chhatarpur range ke diaiji ne apane khaaki vaale sahyogiyon kaa hi saath dete hue unpar keval 500 rupee kaa jurmaana lagaaya
 Describing the rape case as serious, the Human Rights Commission has recommended a severe penalty to the DIG Chhatarpur range, with a fine of five hundred rupees imposed on the then police station in-charge DN Raj
 ayog ne shashan se kaha he ki aavedika ke maanavadhikaar hanan ke liye nireekshak di en raaj ko jimmedaar tehraate hue unpar jurmaana lagane kii jagah vibhageeya kaarywahi kar kathortam dand diya jaae
 He has also instructed that the applicant be given fifty thousand rupees as interim compensation
 anushansa main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki shashan chaahe to yah raashi nireekshak di en raaj se vasuul saktaa he
 Following the recommendations, instructions have been given to send the report to the Commission in two months
 chhatarpur jile kii nivasee aavedika ne ayog ko shikaayat kii thi ki shankar or ajuddhi patel ne bandook ke dam par use baradwaha or koden gaanv ke haar le jaakar uske saath balaatkaar kiya
 The commission sought a report from the Chhatarpur Superintendent of Police
 police adheekshak ne shikaayat ko sahi paaya or bameetha ke thana prabharee di en raaj ko laaparvaahee ke liye chhatarpur range ke police up mahanireekshak dwaara paanch sau rupye kaa jurmaana lagaaya gaya
 The Commission wrote in its remarks that it was clear from the facts that the crime was highly serious, despite DN Raj possibly causing unnecessary delay in registering the offense for the benefit of the opposition
 ghatana 20 oktober 2010 kii thi or aparaadh 4 janvari 2011 ko darj kiya gaya
 The result was that the applicant could neither be saved from crime in time nor could immediate help be provided
 aparaadh der se darj karne ke kaaran donon abhiyukt faraar ho gaye or baad main ek abhiyukt pakadaa ja sakaa or mukhya apradhi nahin pakadaa ja sakaa
 It is clear from the facts that Inspector DN Raj violated human rights
 ayog ne likhaa he ki ek mahila ke saath itnaa gambhir aparaadh hua or jis asamvedansheeltaa kaa parichay police nireekshak ne diya, usase spasht ho jaataa he ki vah mahilaon ke prati kitni samvednaa rakhata he
 He waives the offense for several days
 jis gambhir maamle main abhiyukt giraftaar kiye jane chahie, usamen purnat: samvedanheenata dikhaata he
 Even then, he does not want to give his explanation in the commission
 aise samvedanheen pulicekarmi ko is gambhir laaparvaahee ke liye maatr paanch sau rupye kaa arthdand die jane ko ascharyajanak bataate hue ayog ne kaha ki police adhikariyon ko aise pulicekarmi ke viruddh kathortam karrwai kerani chahie thi, jisase anya pulicekarmiyon ko is sambandh main sabak miltaa

 If Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is not in support of demonetisation then he is not in opposition but he believes that the Prime Minister should reveal all the advantages and disadvantages to the country about the consequences of demonetisation

 One of the gom's various task forces on defense management — a former close aide of the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi led by Arun Singh — recommended the creation of the post of CDS
 singh ko sena kii gahari samaj thi, jo rajeev gandhi ke mantrimandal main raksha rajyamantri bhi rah chuke the
 According to him, the four-star CDS would be the first among all army chiefs to achieve equal status and increase 'coordination' between the three armies, take administrative control over nuclear forces and oversee 'decentralization of the decision-making process'

 The recommendations not only caused concern among the three military services, but also the Ministry of Defense was afraid of it

 The Ministry of Defense accepted only the less controversial sections of the report

 The COSC did not recommend theater command — where the Army, Air and Navy would be led by a single military commander

 This was done to allay the fears of the Air Force

 agar bajet or sansadhano kaa aavanton uske haathon main de die jaataa he, to vah kisi bhi anya sainya pramukh se bahut zyada taqatvar hoga
 An important and controversial issue will be whether the CDS will command the military units on the ground, that is, whether it will have the theater command, as recommended by the Shekatkar committee
 sena kaa dabadabaa hone ke dar se nausena or vaayu sena aisi ekikrut kaman kaa virodh kar rahi hai

 Instead of leaving the implementation of this decision completely in the hands of the army, one has to be more proactive about the framework of defense policy
 ÓÓ2001 ke mantri-samooh ne sidies ko kharid or pariyojnaon ke maamle main teenon sena kii andruni or aapasi praathamiktaayen tay karne ke jariye yojana banane kii prakriya kii dakshata or prabhaav badhaane kaa kaam saunpa tha
 In 2017, then Minister of State for Defense Subhash Bhamre conducted a study, which found that in the three years preceding it, barely 10 per cent of the 144 plans of the defense equipment were awarded for 18-25 months
 The fix was completed in time
 inamen se 133 yojanaon ne jo ausat samay liya tha 52 maheene, vah tay samay se dogune se bhi zyada tha
 The study found that some of the reasons for this delay were lack of coordination between the three forces
 isane paaya ki alag-alag sena ne apni jaruraton ko saral or kargar banane ke liye utana nahin kiya, jitna jaruri tha
 The Army's future plans were made isolated and the mutual involvement among them was not as much as it should have been

 For example, the IDS could have decided what was more important and important — a third aircraft carrier for the Navy or 110 fighter aircraft for the Air Force
 isi ke hisaab se vah bajet aavantit kar saktaa tha
 a key recommendation of the 2001 gom for CDS was that it would ensure 'jointness' or engagement
 teenon sena ke ekikaran ke alaava sidies ko asainya afasarshahi ke saath sashastr balon ke ekikaran ko badhaava dena hoga
 Shekatkar says that bringing or linking the headquarters of the armed forces to the Ministry of Defense should be a major priority
 ve kehete hai, ''shuruyaat main leftinent generalon ko adishnal secretary or major generalon ko joint secretary ke samakaksh ke taur par niyukt karnaa hoga

" is pad kii sweekaaryata or vikaas main vakt lagegaa, sankraman kii ek avadhi hogi
 Senior defense officials say the next logical step is to convert the command into a theater to make CDS more effective
 sainya vishleshak brigadier jarkeyes adrianvaala (sevanivrutt) kehete hai, ''ekikrut pranali or sidies ke bagaiyr alag-alag senaaon kii ladaai kii takat main badhotaree alahada jaagiren hi bani rahati hai or unamem jang ladgaye kii ekajute mashin ke taur par apni gajab kii takat kaa istemaal karne kshamta nahin hoti
 "but the process of unifying the three forces into a common war theater will take many years
" iske liye maujuuda kaman dhaanche main baari badlaav karne honge
 All three forces are present in the southern command in good numbers and can be converted into theater first
 iske liye ek sanyukt mukhyalay bananaa hoga jisamen saajha khufia, sanchaar, jasusi, nigaraanee tathaa vaayu raksha pranaliyaan hongi

 India's voice monarch 'lata Mangeshkar' turned 88 on 28 September
 apni aawaaj ke jaadu se lakhon dilon par raaj karne vaali lata ko sabhi swar kokila ke naam se bhi jaanate hai
 Lata Mangeshkar is the name of a magical voice that has dominated the world of Hindi songs for over seven decades
 1929 ko indore main janmin lata ne lagbhag 30 hajaar se zyada gane gaae hai
 Let us know some untold things related to the life of the queen of tunes
 
 
 lata mangeshkar ke pita pandit deenanath mangeshkar ek clasical singer or theatre artist the
 Lata was the eldest of her three sisters Meena, Asha, Usha and one brother, Hridaynath
 lata mangeshkar kaa janm ke vakt naam 'hema' rakhaa gaya tha, lekin kuch saal baad apane theatre ke ek paatr 'latikaa' ke naam par, deenanath ji ne unka naam 'lata' rakhaa
 At the age of five, Lata started taking music lessons from her father and used to act in theater
 saal 1942 main jab lata ji maatr 13 saal kii thi to unke pita kaa nidhan ho gaya phir puure parivaar kii dekhbhaal karne ke liye lata nikal padi
 He acted in the Marathi film Pehli Mangla Gaur

 Then in the year 1946 he sang the song 'paa Impl Kar Jori' in Hindi film 'aapka Seva Mein'
 produsar sashdhar mukherjee ne lata mangeshkar kii aawaaj ko 'patali aawaaj' kahkar apni film 'shahid' main gane se manaa kar diya tha
 Then music director Ghulam Haider asked Lata Mangeshkar to sing the song 'dil Mera Toda, Kahin Ka Na Chhota' in the film 'majda' which was well appreciated
 lata mangeshkar ne ek intervyuu main gulam haidar ko apana 'godfadar' kaha tha
 Perhaps the story of Lata's life can shock you
 saal 1962 main jab lata 32 saal kii thi tab unhen slo poijan diya gaya tha
 Padma Sachdev, a close confidant of Lata, has mentioned this in his book Aisa Kaun Se Laun
 haalanki, unhen maarane kii koshish kisne kii, iskaa khulaasa aaj tak nahin ho paaya
 Lata Mangeshkar has sung songs in more than 1000 Hindi films and more than 36 languages since 1942, in almost 7 decades
 lata mangeshkar ko saal 2001 main 'bharat ratna' se bhi nawaja ja chukaa he
 Lata ji has also been awarded the Padma Bhushan (1969), Padma Dada Saheb Phalke Award (1989), and Padma Vibhushan (1999)

 Presenting here excerpts from Varma's book 'adi Shankaracharya - Great Thinker of Hinduism'
 is pustak kaa prakaashan hindi or angreji main westland publications ne kiya he
 Originally written in English, the book has been translated by Dheeraj Kumar
 pawan ke verma is pustak kii bhoomika main likhte hai- "hindu dharm, iske adhiktar anuyaayiyon ke liye, jivan jeene kaa ek tarika he
 It has no one pope, no single scripture, no rigidly prescribed customs, no compulsory group, nor one main temple
 shaayad is vajah se yah anant kaal se faltaa-phulataa aa rahaa he; yah sanathan or anant he kyonki jo sarvyaapee he lekin kshanbhangur rup tak simit nahin he, wo avinashi he
 But perhaps it is for this reason that while most Hindus follow faith in their own way, on the other hand, they are unaware of the importance of philosophical bases of their religion
 "hindutv, ek dharm ke rup main, hindutv darshan se alag nahin he
 If Hindus are away from the philosophical basis of their religion, they are deliberately choosing to cover it, leaving the treasure inside
 jab dharm bade paimaane par reeti-rivaajon tak simit ho jaataa he, to is baat kaa khatra bad jaataa he ki bahari rang-rup ko saar kii tulana main adhik mahatv milegaa
 i believe it will be a loss to Hindutva, and to its great saints, ascetics and thinkers - to whom i humbly dedicate this book - who have given some of the world's most profound philosophical insights to this eternal religion
 isi kaaran maine ye kitaab likhi
 "jagad Guru Adi Shankaracharya was undoubtedly one of the greatest scholars who contributed to Hinduism's relentless pursuit of the ultimate truth
 battis varshon kaa unka chota sa jivan utana hi adbhut he jitna wo advait darshan jise unhone kushalta se gadha he
 My aim was to discover this great personality and his life, and in this quest, i traveled from Kaladi in Kerala to his birthplace, his Samadhi site to Kedarnath - and most of the places i went to related to his life Huh

 To tell the truth, the most important aspect during my entire research was my research of the synergy between their philosophical theories, and the inventions of modern science, especially cosmology, quantum physics and neuroscience
 "iske baad lekhak ne apni kitaab ko likhane main sahaayta ke liye main kai logon kii kritagyata vyakt karte hue vistaar se unke sahyog kaa zikr kiya he, jinamein mani shankar dvivedi, vidwaan-rajaneta dow

 It does not look different from other cities in India - shops, dust, cars, motorcycles, scooters, concrete and noise - except in the sense that this is where a millennium and two hundred years ago, the birth of a child It was that which changed the course of Hinduism and raised the level of philosophy and metaphysics so high that no one has been able to match it till date

 He states that Kaladi was forgotten for many centuries, until in the last years of the nineteenth century, the thirty-third monastery of the Sringeri Peeth (the first monastery founded by Shankaracharya), Sachchidananda Shivabhinav Bharati, began to search for the birthplace of the great saint-philosopher
 Had

 However, there was only one Kaladi on the banks of Poorna and this was an important sign, as all the traditional biographies of Shankaracharya were unanimously told that their family home was on the banks of Poorna

 When the research team arrived at the house which was believed to be that of Shankar, they found lamps burning lamps on a stone pillar in the corner of the house

 The couple lived a holy life according to the religious customs and teachings described in the scriptures
 unke jivan kaa khalipan tha unki koi santan nahin hona
 Legend has it that one night, their patriarch, Shiva, came to Aryamba's dream and accepted her prayer for a child
 dilachasp he ki shiv ne aryamba ko do vikalp die the ki wo yaa to ek murkh ko janm dengi jiskaa jivan lanbaa hoga yaa phir ek vidwaan ko janm dengi jisaki mrityu yuvavastha main ho jaaegi
 According to Kivdanti, Aryamba chose the second option

 It is based on Shankara's description of Kumaril Bhatt, who dated to around 700 AD, and also rejected the theories of Asanga, Nagarjuna and Ashwaghosh, whose lifespan was not earlier than the 3rd century AD, as well as Shankar
 They came after Bhartrihari whose life according to Yijing is around 600 AD

 The truth is that there is no existence of direct evidence about Shankar's date of birth, and modern historians who based on the findings of his writings and references to his contemporary or first-born celebrities say that he was born in 778 AD, They also have to accept other traditions, which are based not on historiography but on faith (and the arguments associated with it)
 unki janmatithi par vivaad ke baavjood, unke jivan ke duusare vivaranon kaa mail unki vidyaman jivaniyon or inase jude pramaanon se karaayaa ja saktaa he
 We know that Bal Shankar started showing his miraculous talent from an early age
 kaha jaataa he ki teen varsh kii aayu puri karne ke pehle hi unhen veda or moolbhoot sanskrit granth kanthsth ho gaye the, unki asaadhaaran samaran shakti ke kaaran wo jis cheez ko ek baar sunate the, wo unhen yaad ho jaati thi
 Ekta Shruti Dhara
 yah lagbhag nishchit he ki prarambh se hi wo sanyas kaa jivan jeene kii pravriti dikhaane lage the, or un paaramparik sukhon kaa tyaag karne lage the jo unki saamaajik prishthbhumi ke pratibhavan bacchon ko aasaani se milte the
 Naturally, this was a concern for his mother
 ek ore jahaan wo apane putr kii bauddhik paripakvata par garv karti thim, jisaki charchaa puure gaanv or uske baahar bhi hoti thi, vahiin wo ye nahin chaahati thim ki unka putr sadhu-sanyasi bane
 Like any other mother, she wanted her son to marry, have children and live with them, especially because her husband, Sivaguru, died when Shankar was very young and lived the life of a widow
 Were
 haalanki, shankar sansaarik jivan kaa tyaag karne or ek sanyasi kaa jivan bitaane ke apane nirnay se nahin dig rahe the
 There must have been a lot of tension between the mother and the son, but the subject was decided after an incident which showed some imagination and some facts
 kaha jaataa he ki ek baar jab shankar nadi main snaan kar rahe the, ek magaramchh ne unka pair pakad liya
 He called his mother and said: 'mother! save me! a crocodile has caught me and i cannot escape unless you allow me to become a monk
 maa, der mat karo, anyathaa bahut der ho jaaegi!’ aryamba pal bhar ke liye hichkichain, lekin unke putr ko magaramchh khinchakar gahare pani main le ja rahaa tha, or unke paas hami bharne ke atirikt koi vikalp nahin tha
 As soon as he gave his permission, it is said that the crocodile freed Shankar and disappeared
 kya vastav main aisi koi ghatana hui thi, yaa ye kisi jeevani lekhak kii kalpana kii udaan thi? iskaa koi spasht uttar dena kathin he
 There is every possibility that some dramatic event would have forced Aryamba to say yes, because under normal circumstances, a widowed mother would never allow her son to sacrifice himself
 ye bhi ho saktaa he ki apni mata kii sahmati praapt karne ke liye shankar ne koi chaal chali ho
 On the other hand, crocodiles may be a metaphor of worldly life from which Shankar had attained emancipation, an imaginative historian has devised symbolism
 aisi kahaniyon main tathy, kivdanti, aakhyaan or pratikatmakataa aapas main ghul-mil jaati hai, lekin itnaa to sach he ki aaj bhi, shankar ke ghar ke bilkul najadik, ek magaramchh ghat he jahaan is nirnaayak kshan ko yaad kiya jaataa he, or ek vaarshik utsav yojit kiya jaataa he
 Aryamba had given her consent under pressure, but she was also worried about being alone
 unhen ek paaramparik chintaa bhi thi ki unka antim sanskaar koun karegaa
 Shankar assured her that whenever his mother, whether awake or unconscious, would need him, he would return
 unhone ye vachan bhi diya ki unki mrityu ke baad vahi antim sanskaar karenge, bhale hi ye sanyasi jivan vyateet karne waalon ke liye paaramparik rup se varjit tha
 With this pledge, he took leave of his mother and left home in his childhood in search of a suitable guru
 ye talash unhen dakkan pathaar or satpura shreniyon ke paar narmada nadi ke tat par omkareshwar le ai, jo vindhyas main or indore se thodaa dakshin kii ore he
 The hills of the city resemble the shape of a camel, and the Narmada flowing along the side of the city also looks like an oon
 darasal, omkareshwar ek dweep he, ek taraf wo narmada se ghira he or duusari taraf narmada kii sahaayak nadi reva se
 The two rivers, separated just before Omkareshwar, merge after crossing the city
 shankar ke aagaman ke sadiyon pehle se, omkareshwar ko ek pavitra shahar ke rup main janaa jaataa tha, jahaan shiv ke pratik baarah jyotirlingon main se ek sthit he
 But this temple was not the main reason that Shankar came to Omkareshwar after crossing dense forests hundreds of miles away
 unki talash sachche guru ke liye thi, or wo jaanate the ki is shahar main vedant ke vidwaan govindpad rahete the, jo prasiddh goudpad ke shishy or putr the
 Gaudapada composed Karika, the primary interpretation on the Mandukya Upanishad
 adhiktar logon kii manyata he, or sthaneey log bhi yahi maanate hai ki jab shankar goudpad se milane aae to wo ek gupha ke andar dhyanamgn the
 Shankar waited outside the cave, and when Gaudapada came out of the meditative state, he asked the little boy: 'who are you?' According to legend, in response to this, Shankar read a verse: 'I am neither earth , Neither water, nor fire, nor air, nor sky, nor any other substance
 main indriya bhi nahin hum or naa hi man
 i am Shiva, the inseparable essence of consciousness
 ’itnaa sargarbhit uttar sunakar, goudpad ne shankar ko apane sangrakshan main le liya
 In many places it is described that to express his acceptance, Gaudapada stretched out one of his feet outside the cave and Shankar bowed reverently and touched it
 yah nishchit nahin he ki shankar kitne samay tak goudpad ke ashram main rahe
 We can assume that he must have been there for eighteen months to three years, during which he must have mastered Advaita philosophy
 aap kalpana kar sakate hai ki aaj se baarah sau varsh purv omkareshwar kaisaa rahaa hoga: ek dwavipiya pahari, chaaron taraf hariyaali, narmada or reva ke svachh pani se ghira hua, pahari kii dhaal par ek pracheen mandir, or isse laga hua govindpad kaa ashram
 How much has it changed today? And what is left, how many of these things confirm the facts of Shankar's visit and his stay here? *** i flew from Delhi to Indore to find out

 He had no doubt that Shankar stayed at Govindapada's ashram in Omkareshwar and in support of this he recounted several episodes of his life
 unke varnan main puranic aakhyaan or tathy gunthe hue the
 He said that the cave where Shankar met Govindapada is still there
 saath hi narmada ke paar, mamaleshwar par wo mandir bhi he, jo shankar ne un tirthayatriyon ke liye banwaaya tha jo monsoon ke dauraan narmada ke ufaan par rahane ke kaaran omkareshwar ke mukhya shiv mandir ke darshan nahin kar pate the
 The temple of Mamaleshwar is similar to the temple built on the island

 We need to know the scholar Dr
 mishra se kuch bahut nayaa jaanane ko nahin mila, sivaay iske ki shankar ke omkareshwar ke saath sambandh main unki vyaktigat aasthaa thi
 While we were taking leave, he placed in my hands a small stone of the shape of Shivling, and said that every such stone found in the Narmada symbolizes the joint blessings of both Shiva and Shankaracharya
 hamaara aglaa padaav tha mithilesh prasad treepathi kaa ghar, jo vinamr mishraji kii tulana main bilkul alag prakruti ke the
 He had a red tilak on his forehead; His spherical figure gave the impression that he hoped to be taken seriously; He has no pleasure in talking to fools; He was proud to study Sanskrit throughout his life, he directly rejected fake scholars; He made it clear that he did not tolerate traditional thinking, and was displeased with the pundits who followed him without knowing the meaning behind the practices
 treepathiji ne jor dekar kaha ki sabhi pramaan is ore sanket dete hai ki shankar omkareshwar aae the, or govindpad ke ashram main rahe the
 He said that Shankar had imbibed Advaita's teachings at Omkareshwar from Govindapada, and his father Gaudapada, and its influence on his young brain lasted long
 yahaan apane padaav ke dauraan, shankar ko ek vidhyaarthee kii tarah dekha janaa chahie, jo vedant kii baarikiyon ko jaanane kaa icchhuk tha
 His penchant for learning was beyond doubt, and Govindapada's gurukula provided the ideal environment to do so, where teachers teach students according to a rigorous schedule of study, investigation and thinking
 khulkar ho rahi hamaari baatcheet ke dauraan idhar-udhar kii bahut sari baaten huin, kyonki treepathiji, jo apni choti si baithak ke dewan par palathi markar baithe the, baar-baar mukhya vishay se bhatakkar sanskrit adhyayan ke kshetra main apane kuch samakakshon kii aalochana karne lagate the
 But, there was one important point to which he pointed my attention
 unhone mujhe kaha ki sirf shankar ke darshan or unke bauddhik paridrishy par kendrit mat raho
 Of course, that is important, but equally important is to know what Sankara learned in terms of public service in the monastery of Gaudapada, and the creation of centers where Advaita philosophy can be taught and preserved
 haalanki shankar mimasaa karmkand (vaidic nirdeshon ke anusaar prathaon kaa paalan) ke viruddh the, unhone is prakaar kii niswaarth seva kaa samarthan kiya tha, or is bare main unki soch kii neenv omkareshwar main padi thi
 Despite all his haughtiness, Tripathi was quite engrossed with us till we left, and came to our car to say goodbye to us
 jab ham ja rahe the, unhone kaha ki wo akele rahanaa pasand karte the
 He reports that his wife has gone to America with her children, and his nephew takes care of them
 wo kaaphi kuch ekantavasi the, jo sanskrit or hindu darshan ke apane adhyayan main duba he, or apane hajaaron pustakon ke bich akelaa rahakar santusht he, lekin agar koi uske vichaaron ko chunauti detaa he to wo tark-vitark karne par uddhat ho jaataa he
 During our journey up to Omkareshwar we passed through the Vindhya Range
 sadaken ghumaavdaar thim, bhu-bhaag pahari or sagwan ke pedo se bharaa hua, jo tej dhoop main kumhala rahe the, or unki kaagaj kii tarah sukhi pattiyaan har taraf bikhri hui thim
 It took us two hours to reach Gajanan Maharaj Ashram in Omkareshwar, where our stay was arranged
 ashram, jo narmada se bilkul najadik tha, shanti or hariyaali ke marudyan ke samaan tha, jiske parisar ke bichobich pattharon se bana ek shant mandir tha
 Ashram's administrator Joshiji welcomed us with tea and biscuits and showed us our rooms, which were plain but clean, air-conditioned, and with modern toilets

 a few steps away from the temple is the cave where Shankar met Govindapada
 haalanki pravesh dwaar ke baahar eenton kii bani susajjit rachana he, gupha ko saaf taur par usase alag rakhaa gaya he
 There is a statue of Shankar in black stone inside the cave
 isamen unhen ek oonche asana par palathi markar baithe dikhaaya gaya he, or unke baayen haath main chirparichit yaachak dand he
 Above them is a stone mural depicting a popular legend about Shankar's divine powers
 ek baar, jab narmada puure ufaan par thi, iskaa pani gupha main ghusane kaa khatra tha jahaan govindpad gahare dhyaan main the
 To prevent his master from disturbing his peace, Shankar raised his hand and the river water receded
 is dantakatha ke ek or varnan main bataaya jaataa he ki unhone apana kalash yaa bhikshapaatr uthaaya, or nadi kaa sara pani usamen samaa gaya
 The stone frescoes show Govindapada meditating inside the cave, and Shankar, whose feet are in the swollen river, controlling the river
 gupha ke andar ek or behad dilachasp pratimaa he
 It is a statue of Kali, the Mother Goddess, but its depiction is tantric, with a red sari on the body, the face is not clear but the red tilak on the forehead
 is chithran kii sarvaadhik sammohak visheshta he devi kii ankhen, kaali or bhedane vaali drushti, jo daraavne tareeke se aapkaa har disha main peechha karti hai
 The chief priest of the temple tells me that this statue was built and placed in the cave after Shankar's visit to Bengal
 vahaan wo kai tantrikon se mili the, or unhen shastrarth yaa vaad-vivaad main haraane main asamarth rahe the kyonki tantravaad main unki jaankaree paryaapt nahin thi
 Therefore, he returned to Omkareshwar and learned Tantra in the form of Kali Siddhi
 devi kii ye pratimaa us samay hi sthapit kii gai thi
 It is believed that after mastering himself in Tantrism, Shankar again went to Bengal and defeated his Tantric rivals
 ***narmada ek khubasurat nadi he
 Although its stream in Omkareshwar is thin now because many dams have been built upwards, it is still an attractive river and completely different for many reasons
 ye bharat kii ekmaatr badi nadi he jo purv se pashchim kii ore bahati he; saath hi ekmaatr nadi he jiske donon kinaaron par mandir bane hai, jis kaaran ise ubhay tat tirth bhi kaha jaataa he
 The name Narmada also has special significance
 nar kaa arth he purush, or maadaa kaa arth he stri: nadi donon kii shaktiyon kaa pratik he, yaa donon kii shaktiyon kaa sammilan he jaisaa ardhnarishwar kii avadharana main chitrit kiya gaya he, ardhnarishwar hindu puranic kathaon main ubhayalingi devtaa hai
 The next morning, as we were leaving from Omkareshwar after taking a morning dip in the Narmada, i was thinking about Shankar's connection with the city
 wo kaise ghaney jangalon se hote hue sudur kerala ke kaladi se yahaan tak pahunche honge? kya is pavitra shahar tak aane kaa koi gyaat rasta tha, yaa phir unhone nauparivahan kii paaramparik vidhiyon kii madad lee thi? aise yug main jab sanchaar aarambhik daur main tha, unhen govindpad, or unke pita, goudpad ke bare main jaankaree kaise mili thi? is samay tak koi chhapaakhana nahin tha
 Then how did he know about Gaudapada's original work on Advaita philosophy? Did they get information about the karika or the Mandukya Upanishad through oral text that was transmitted from one disciple to another, and how did it reach Kaladi so far? What informal web of reading was available at the time that made this flow of information possible? The extraordinary connection between philosophies and the rites of religious practices also shocked me
 kaha jaataa he ki govindpad or shankaracharya apane din kii shuruyaat paas ke jyotirling ke darshan se karte the
 In the cave where Govindapada lived, there was intellectual research about Advaita, Gunatetam Brahma, which was beyond human formulation, beyond human worship, was formless and was beyond all religious rites
 lekin jab ek baar wo mandir main pravesh karte the, wo shiv or parvati ko dandavat pranaam karte the, ek vyakturup devtaa kii puja ke liye sabhi dharmik sanskaron kaa paalan karte the, jinamein shiv or parvati ke liye daanpaty anand ke saath raatri vyateet karne kii taiyaari hoti thi or manoranjan ke liye chapad-pasa kaa khel bhi sammilit hota tha
 The extraordinary humanization of divinity, and the contemplation and research behind the rhetoric of ritualism and worship, both of which coexisted
 omkareshwar main kuch saal thaharne ke baad, or jab unhone govindpad ke saannnidhya main advait siddhant kii gudhata main maharath hasil kar lee, shankaracharya ne apane guru se varanasi jane kii ajna maangi
 They must have taken many months to complete this long journey on foot, through dense forests, and through unknown areas, and also have to contend with the dangers of robbers and bandits
 varanasi main, wo kai varshon tak rahe, or yaheen unhone apane kai mahatvapurn lekhan kaary kiye, jinamein shankar bhashya, brahm sutara kii unki vyakhya, bhagavad gita par unki vyakhya, or mukhya upanishad shaamil hai
 Why did Shankar decide to go to Varanasi? It is quite clear that, even then, the city was the capital of Hindu faith, where saints and philosophers lived on the banks of the Ganges, and extensively communicated many aspects of Hindu philosophy
 hindu vichaardhaara ke kisi vidwaan ke liye, duusare darshanik vidwaanon ke saath charchaa, vaad-vivaad or baatcheet dwaara, apni pratishtha pramanit karne ke liye ye bilkul upyukt manch tha
 Therefore, it was natural that Shankar, whose reputation as a philosophical scholar had spread far and wide, thought of residing in Varanasi
 ***maine varanasi main shankar ke padaav ke bare main adhik jaankaree jutaney kii koshish ke liye vahaan kii yatra kii
 My old friend, Ashok Kapoor came to pick me up at the airport
 wo varanasi ke pratishthit samskruthikarmi hai, or philhal shahar main intake ke sanyojak hai, unki gahari ruchi duniya ke sabase pracheen shaharon main ek is shahar ke jeern-sheern or upekshit aitihaasik sthalon ke punaroddhar main he
 Varanasi, also known as Banaras and Kashi, is a vast labyrinth of narrow streets and temples on the western bank of the Ganges
 inhen galiyon main, itani ghani aabaadi rahati he jo maanav kalpana ke pare he
 Sometimes, you may wonder how people, temples, motorcycles, scooters, dogs, cows, dirt and noise live together in a situation where the ratio of location and population is incredibly impaired
 lekin, varanasi ne anadi kaal se hi avishwasaneey chizon ko chunauti di he
 The association of this ancient city with modernity, as a city which has now gone far beyond the ghats and streets, can be said to be extremely confused
 hawaii adde se hamaare safar main jarurat se kaaphi zyada samay laga kyonki ek fliover, jiskaa kaam kaaphi pehle khatm ho janaa chahie tha, abhi bhi nirmaanadhin tha
 The new city is full of traffic, noise, pollution and filth, in short, a nightmare for the municipality that has no easy solution
 haalanki, adbhut baat ye he ki varanasi ke log in sabhi ko bade shant bhav se sweekaar karte hai, shaayad isliye kyonki wo janmajaat vairaagi hai, yani nashwar jagat ke kashton se beparwaah hai, jo galat he uske liye bahut zyada chintaa nahin karte, kyonki, aakhirkaar, samay anant he, or sahasrabdiyon puraani ganga ke samaan, wo samay ke anant chitrafalak par ek kan bhar hai
 i first stopped at Sampoornanand Sanskrit University in Varanasi
 vahaan darshanashastra kii faikalti ke pramukh professor hari prasad adhikari ne, jo tulanaatmak dharmadarshan padhaate hai, mere liye shankar or hindu darshan ke vidwaanon ke saath mulaakaat kaa prabandh kiya tha
 There are no tables and chairs
 ham farsh par ek safed chadar par baithte hai or peeth ko sahaara dene ke liye masanad hai
 The session begins with Mangalacharya, the worship of religious mantras or hymns written by Shankaracharya
 aisa lag rahaa tha ki jaise wo samay doharaaya ja rahaa ho jab shankar ke dinon main shastrarth hota hoga
 Many professors of various aspects of Hindu philosophy exist
 unamem se har koi apane drushtikon or vyakhya kaa kattar samarthak he
 They all accept the superiority of the Advaita doctrine developed by Shankar, but they all have different views on it, and evaluate it from their philosophical point of view
 ek jabardast vaad-vivaad shuru ho jaataa he, or sanskrit shlokon kii barish hone lagati he, kyonki har vaktaa shabd gyaan, pratyaksh gyaan, shruti kii vaidhata, shankar ke vichaaron par buddhatv kaa prabhaav, advaitvaad kii simaaon or ramanuj jaise baad ke hindu darshanikon dwaara viksit vishisht advait jaise gudh vishyon par alag-alag drushtikon prastut karne lagata he
 Excitement increases and thoughts collide
 jab koi kisi vaktaa ko bich main toktaa he, to wo kadaa virodh karata he ki ye shastrarth ke niyamon ke viruddh he, jahaan aapattiyaan darj hone ke pehle har dhurandhar ko uskaa drushtikon purna rup se prastut karne kii anumati milani hi chahie
 Professor officers try their best to balance the discussion, but often they go unheard
 aisa ek ghante se zyada samay tak chalata he, jab tak ki adhikari up-shringaar, jo saransh or dhanyavad gyaapan kaa rup he, ke dwaara baithak ko samaapt nahin kar dete
 By this time everyone's mercury has come down, and i am told that such an ideological confrontation on esoteric points of Hindu spiritual science is very common in this small group of philosophy teachers, who have spent their entire lives studying Sanskrit texts Have spent kuch varshon pehle ek shastrarth main, ek professor, jinaki vidwata kaa bada sammaan tha, apane ek pratidwandvi kii shankar ke siddhanton kii vyakhya se itane krodhit ho gaye the ki uskaa khandan karne ke dauraan hi hridayaghat se unki mrityu ho gai
 It seemed a bit unrealistic that i had seen
 yahaan, vishvavidhyalay ke ek saadhaaran se upekshit kamare main, mutthi bhar log is tarah charchaa kar rahe the jaise ki unka jivan is par nirbhar ho, un muddon par jinke bare main adhiktar hinduon ko kuch nahin pataa! kya maine abhi-abhi jo dekha tha, wo usee cheez kaa punarotthana tha, jo shankar ke samay main ganga ke tat par hota rahaa hoga? shaayad haa, lekin antar ye he ki tab saadhaaran log bhi paricharchaa ke vishyon se puri tarah anjaan nahin rahete the, or vastav main dharanaon or tarkon ke hindu darshanik anubhav ko jite the
 Sampurnanand Sanskrit University is one of the oldest educational institutions in India
 isaki sthapana 1791 main hui thi, ek angrej, jonathan dancan ke dwaara, jinhone governor general lord cornwalis ko ek sanskrit mahavidhyalay kii jarurat bataai thi taaki mahatvapurn granthon kaa anuwaad kiya ja sake, jinamein prashasnic jaruraton ke granth bhi shaamil the
 An annual budget of 20,000 rupees was approved, and John Muir was appointed the first principal of the college
 1857 main, college ne postagraduate kii padhai shuru kii, or 1974 main ise vishvavidhyalay kaa darja diya gaya
 But this university is withering away as most Indians do not have time for the knowledge contained in Sanskrit and its texts
 isliye, kai myanon main hindu darshanashastra kii gudhataaon par charchaa ke liye sanskrit shloke uddhrit karte hue uttejnapurvak bahes karne vaale professor apane hi desh main avshesh jaise ho gaye hai
 The college's Saraswati Library, established in 1894, has the most valuable collection of Sanskrit manuscripts, but most of them have not been read
 vishvavidhyalay kaa suutaravakya he shrutam me gopaay-- meraa gyaan surakshit rahe
 Unfortunately, it seems that the British - even for certain reasons - were more concerned about it than we are today
 koi bhi professor mujhe varanasi main shankar ke padaav ke bare main aitihaasik vivaran nahin de sakaa
 He argued that in that era, scholarly attention was more on ideas and concepts, rather than on chronological order and workplace, and therefore left no account for future generations
 jab shankar yahaan rahete the to banaras kaisaa dikhataa tha? wo kahaan rahete the? or wo kitne samay tak yahaan rahe the? aisa lagata tha ki kisi ko nahin pataa
 Certainly, the city would have been quite small, restricted to stairs on the ghats or river banks, and settlements built along the banks of the Ganges
 sankeern galiyon kii bhulbhulaiya, jo nadi ke kinare tak le jaati he, rahi to hogi, lekin kaaphi kam jansankhya ke saath; tulanaatmak rup se shahar saaf rahaa hoga, nadi saaf rahi hogi, or tat par adhik sthaan hoga, jahaan sadhu or vidwaan apane parichaarkon ke saath thahar sakate the
 i went to Kedar Ghat where a branch of Sringeri Monastery was established, probably in the fourteenth century
 maine ye nishkarsh ‘shri jagadguru shankaracharya math’ ke bheetar lagi ek pattee se nikaala jis par likhaa tha: “is pracheen chandramaulishwar lingam kii sthapana or puja poojaneey shri vidyaarany mahaswamiji shri shringery sharada peethadhipati ne 1346 isvi main kii thi
 There is a temple inside the monastery that worships Ganesh and Goddess Sharada, along with the same idol of Adi Shankaracharya installed between them, as in Kalady
 kya shringery math ne is sthaan ko chunaa kyonki shankar yahaan yaa iske paas kahin rahete the? is kshetra main dakshin bharat ke nivaasiyon kii upasthiti bahut adhik he
 How old is this regional connection, and did travelers from the south come here thousands of years ago to settle here? If this is the case, it is likely that Shankar, who hails from Kerala, may have decided to stay here
 lekin, kisi ke paas ye uttar hai nahin
 The Sringeri Math looked deserted, where i could not see any movement of any research or study
 aisa lagata tha ki ye baahar se aane waalon ke liye sirf ek dharmashala kaa kaam karata tha, or manageron ko iske alaava kisi cheez main dilchaspee nahin thi
 The city also has an ashram of the monastery, and also an ashram of the Kanchi Math, which is adjacent to the Banaras Hindu University campus
 ise ‘shri jagat guru shankaracharya ashram’ kaha jaataa he
 a large notice board has been placed at its door, which says that smoking and gutkha is prohibited in the premises, but the people who run it also do not know of any historical details related to Jagadguru's residence in Varanasi
 main manikarnika ghat par bhi gaya, kyonki kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki shankar yaheen rahe the
 Here, everyone was engaged in giving chitagni to the dead
 jab main ghat kii taraf sankari galiyon se ja rahaa tha, mritkon ko kandhaa dene vaale log ‘ram naam satya he’ kaa jaap karte hue guzar rahe the, or mritkon ke sharir kaa antim sanskaar karne ke saaj-saamaan jutaney main lage the
 It seems a mismatch in itself that how lively is the place to cremate the dead
 kisi ooshnakaribandheey jangal main phalne-phoolne vaale jhaad-jhankhaad kii tarah, ghat ke har kone se jivan faltaa-phulataa dikhataa he, or dhwani, sparsh, gandh or drushti kaa prabhaav itnaa ghanaa he ki wo ab niskriy or indriyabodh se rahit in shariron ko mukt karne ke prayaason par haaavee ho jaataa he

 His simple behavior does not tell you that he is a world-renowned expert to investigate scientific reasons as to why a place is chosen to be a holy site
 dow
 Singh has surveyed Kashi's 'sacred geography' and 'space geometry', and for this he has studied magnetic forces around many of its temples and sacred sites, as well as matching the findings of global positioning satellites with sacred texts and Done with the city's traditions
 wo mujhe bataate hai ki kaashi shabd kaa arth he ‘jahaan antariksh se aane vaala prakaash vrittakar rup main sankendrit ho’
 He says that the city has a well-organized pilgrimage system with four known 'inner holy journeys' and they all authentically end at the same point
 ye bindu, jise wo ‘exis mundi’ kehete hai, gyaan vaapi he
 If this is true then it opens the way to an interesting possibility for my search
 gyaan vaapi, jiskaa arth he gyaan kaa kuan, usee sthaan par he jahaan shahar kaa sabase prasiddh shiv mandir, kaashi vishwanath mandir hua karata tha
 The Shivalinga enshrined in the temple is one of the twelve such lingas across India, and is extremely ancient, as described in the Skanda Purana and other ancient Hindu texts
 1194 isvi main, mandir ko qutubuddin aibak ne nasht kar diya tha, lekin terahavin sadi main ek gujarati vyapaaree ne iskaa punarnirmaan karaayaa tha
 It was again destroyed in the fifteenth century by Hussain Shah or Alexander Lodhi, but was rebuilt by King Mansingh during the reign of Emperor Akbar
 haalanki1669 isvi main, aurangzeb ne nirnaayak rup se mandir ko tod diya or uske avshesh par gyaan vaapi masjid banavaa di
 (the information about the new mosque on the remains of the temple comes from the sketch of James Prinsep of 1834
 ) ant main 1780, isvi main, holkar rani, ahilya bai ne paas kii jagah par ek nayaa mandir banwaaya
 Whatever the history, the original Vishwanath temple must have been at its original place, Gyan Vapi, when Shankar traveled to Varanasi
 ab, shankar kaa shiv se lagaav to gyaat he, or wo chaahate honge ki apana nivas apane priy devtaa, or kaashi ke sarvaadhik shraddhey mandir ke paas rahe
 But this possibility has another aspect
 gyaan vaapi lalita ghat par sthit he
 Lalitha, a symbol of welfare, is synonymous with Shiva's wife Parvati
 lalita sahasranama, brahmad puraana main ek granth he or shakti pujakon ke liye mahatvapurn pustak he
 Shankar's inclination towards the Shakti sect and the concept of 'mother Goddess' is attested by the fact that the four monasteries established by him are called Shaktipeeth
 saath hi, manikarnika ghat yahaan se bas kuch hi duuri par he
 It is one of the oldest of the eighty Ghats in Kashi and is described in a Gupta period inscription of the fifth century
 manikarnika kaa arth he kaan main pahanane vaale kundal
 According to mythological belief, when Sati committed self-immolation after her father Daksha's rude behavior towards herself and her husband, Shiva, filled with grief, picked up her dead body and, in a fit of rage, began to meditate on the Himalayas
 aakhirkaar, unke dukh ko khatm hota naa dekhakar, vishnu ne sudarshan chakra kii madad se sati ke sharir ko ikyavan tukdon main baant diya jo bhoomi par gir gaye
 Wherever a piece of his body or garment fell, he became a Shaktipeeth
 puranic manyata ke anusaar, sati kaa kundal manikarnika main gira or tab se is ghat kaa naam manikarnika ghat padaa
 Therefore, Manikarnika Ghat is an important place of worship for the Shakti sect and was called Ekanya Shaktipeeth
 professor singh bataate hai ki manikarnika ghat ko vishesh taur par shmashaan sthal ke rup main dekha janaa sirf atharahavin sadi ke ant main shuru hua he
 Therefore, to say that during his stay in Varanasi, Shankar lived near the most important temple of Shiva, Vishwanath Temple, and also with the important sites of Shakti Sampraday (towards which Shankar's inclination is proved by later evidences) Lalita and Manikarnika Ghat
 Would like, is not baseless
 lekin, ye sirf ek anumaan he, kyonki is baat kaa koi thos pramaan (sivaay chidavilas kii jeevani main ek baar varnan ko chhodkar) uplabdh nahin he
 This is evidence that traditionally historiography has been neglected, in recent times, academic research and curiosity have also been neglected
 kaashi main shankar ke awaas kii bilkul sahi jagah jo bhi ho, vahaan unke jivan se judi kuch ghatnaon kaa varnan unke jeevanikaron ne kiya he
 He has many biographies by the name of Shankar Digvijayam, but the most popular is a biography written by Madhwacharya, who later assumed the name Sri Vidyaranya and became the 12th chief (1380–1386) of Sringeri Sarada Peetham
 in paaramparik vivaranon main, shankar ke dwaara kiye gaye chamatkaaron main khub atishyokti dikhti he
 Even if we consider these to be the imaginations of biographers, we still see some phenomena which are similar in all the details and, therefore, there must be some basis in them
 is baat par sabhi ekamat hai ki kaashi main, shankar ko apane sabase adhik samarpit bhakton main ek, sanandan mila tha
 Legend has it that one day when Sanandan was on the other side of the river, Shankar asked him to cross the river while walking
 bina kuch soche wo shishy, puri aasthaa ke saath, ajnapaalan karne laga
 When he did so, Ganga produced a lotus to help him, and then Sanandan actually walked and crossed the river
 iske baad se, shankar ne uskaa nayaa naam padmapad (jiske pairon main camel ho) rakh diya
 But legends aside, there are three incidents in Varanasi, which are important to present a picture of Shankar's thinking and the social structure of that period
 pehali ghatana he unki ek chandal se mulaakaat, jo paaramparik rup se samaaj ke sabase nichle paaydaan se aane vaala mana jaataa he
 This meeting took place in the narrow streets of the embankment
 darasal, shankar ganga main snaan ke liye ja rahe the jab unhone chandal ko aate dekha
 In those days, Brahmins were believed to be defiled by the mere presence of people of this caste, and so Shankar's disciples asked Chandal to move out of the way
 lekin, chandal ne iskaa pratikaar karte hue prashn poocha: ‘advait siddhant main aisa antar kaise aa gaya ki “ye ek chandal he or ye ek brahman he”? aakhirkaar, sabhi shariron main ek jaisi aatma he, chaahe unki jati koi bhi ho?’shankar ye sunakar bhuchakke rah gaye, or turant hi kaha ki jo bhi brahm ko ekmaatr vaastaviktaa maanata he or sabhi atmaaon ko ek samaan dekhtaa he, wo aadarneey he
 All other variations are untrue, and Chandal, who has experienced the oneness of the Supreme Consciousness, is like my Guru
 yahi vichaar shankar kii paanch chhandon kii rachana, manisha panchakam main pratisthapit kiya gaya he, jisamen se ek chand kaa arth kuch is prakaar he:main hi brahm hum
 And, this entire world is transmitted with pure consciousness
 yah sab, bina kisi avshisht ke, avidya ke madhyam se mere dwaara aropit he jiske teen gun hai (satv, raj or tam)
 Therefore, the one who possesses the eternal, immaculate and true knowledge of the supreme authority that provides unique happiness i
e
 Brahma, is a Guru, be it a Chandal or a Brahmin
 ye meraa antim drushtikon he
 Shankar's views on caste system are discussed in detail in his chapter on philosophy
 yahaan ye bataane kii jarurat he ki kuch jeevanikaron ne kattar or pakshpaati saamaajik tantra kii vaidhata ko sahi sabit karne ke liye chandal kii vidwata ko kam mahatv diya he
 According to his description, as Shankar put forth his views - revolutionary for those who rejected socio-religious bigotry - Chandal disappeared and was replaced by Shiva and the four Vedas
 yahaan koshish ye he ki samanta ke liye chandal ke asaadhaaran kathan ko naganya kar diya jaae, or puri ghatana ko, shiv or vedon ke rup main, ek pavitra aavaran pahanaaya jaae
 The scholars of Sanskrit University whom i met also did the same thing when they told that the Chandal incident is nothing but a way to demonstrate that philosophicalism was infused in Kashi from the lowest to the lowest
 haalanki, sach yahi lagata he ki shankar ke liye chandal se unki mulaakaat, maanav-nirmit sansthaanon dwaara viksit saamaajik bahishkaar ko spashtatya asweekaar karne kaa tarika tha, or jo unke apane darshanik tarkon se mail khaataa he
 The second incident is Shankar's response to a man enthusiastically engaged in learning Sanskrit grammar
 mana jaataa he ki use vyakaran ke niyam jor-jor se bolkar or ratakar yaad karne kii koshish karte hue dekhne ke baad, shankar ne usee pal apane sarvaadhik lokapriy mantron main se ek, bhaj govindam, kii rachana kii, jisamen har chand kii antim pankti main kaha gaya he: ‘govind kii puja karo, govind kii puja karo, govind kii puja karo, he mohagrast! kyonki mrityu ke samay vyakaran ke niyam tumhaari koi sahaayta nahin kar sakate!’bhakthi mantron ke udhaaharan ke rup main, bhaj govindam kaa sthaan kaaphi upar he, or ye aaj bhi bharat bhar main gaaya jaataa he
 This shows that Shankar did not believe in machine knowledge, and he emphasized the need to use the path of knowledge
 wo is baat par bal dete the ki aisa gyaan arjeet kiya jaae jo nashwar jagat, jise ham jarurat se zyada mahatv dete hai, kii kshanbhangurta ko samajhaae or moksh prapti kaa rasta dikhaae
 The third incident is about a debate that took place with an older person over the interpretation of the Brahma Sutra
 tark-vitark lagbhag ek saptaah tak chalate rahe, or donon hi pratibhaagiyon main se koi haar maanane ko taiyaar nahin tha, or, jaisaa maine sanskrit vishvavidhyalay main sankshipt shastrarth main dekha tha, is bahes main nishchit rup se krodh, vyangyokti or katutaa kaa put rahaa hoga
 According to the story, in the end, Shankara's disciple Padmapada urged Vishnu to end the debate
 aakhirkaar ye baat saamne ai, jaisaa paaramparik jivaniyon main daawa kiya gaya he, ki vruddh vyakti brahm sutara ke lekhak vyas kaa avatar tha
 This incident probably reflects the fact that the Vedanta Sutra was heavily debated over Shankar's interpretation, and perhaps he sometimes had to renounce his old view and accept the rival's point
 yahaan vruddh vyakti aisa hi koi pratidwandvi ho saktaa he, jise santusht karnaa shankar ko aasaan naa laga ho or vedant darshan ke sahitya kaa uskaa gyaan itnaa vishaal ho ki use vyas ke ek avatar ke rup main dekha jane laga ho

 e
 Natesan and Company, Chennai, date unknown, p
 28-29] After spending many years in Kashi, during which he would occasionally visit Badrinath, Shankar went to Prayag (today's Allahabad)
 ye kaha jaataa he ki banaras ke tatkaaleen shaasha ratan singh ne unhen yaheen thaharne ke liye manaane kii koshish kii, lekin shankar ne unhen kaha ki unka lakshya ek pathik shikshak banane or apane darshanik drushtikon ko bharat ke sabhi hisson main prasaarit karne kaa he
 In Prayag, he took a bath in the Sangam, which is a sacred combination of Ganga, Yamuna and the mythological Saraswati
 lekin, prayag kii unki yatra sabase adhik yaad kii jaati he assam ke durjey brahman, or hindu darshanashastra kii purv mimasaa ke mahaan pratipaadakon main ek, kumaril bhatta se mulaakaat ke liye
 Followers of this philosophy believed that the main goal of life is ritual
 shankar, jo gyaan maarg kii vaidhata main vishwaas karte the, prathaon par is tarah jor dene se asahmat the, or is matbhinnata par bhatta ke saath vaad-vivaad karne ke icchhuk the
 He could not get this opportunity due to dramatic reasons
 jab wo kumaril bhatta se mili, to ye poojya vidwaan aatmadah karne kii prakriya ke dauraan chaaval kii bhusi ke jalte hue dher par leta hua tha
 He took these terrible steps to atone for the two sins he had committed according to him
 pehla, buddha dharm ke kuch siddhanton ko dhwast karne ke liye unhone ek buddha math main shishy ke chhadam rup main shiksha lee thi taaki wo un siddhanton main maharath hasil kar saken jinhen wo kaatna chaahate the
 Later, he became the most influential critic of Buddhist philosophy, propounded by its later theorists
 lekin is prakriya ke dauraan, unhen apane guru ko ‘dhokhaa dene’ ke aparadhbodh ke saath rahanaa pad rahaa tha, jinke charnon main unhone shiksha lee thi
 This fraud required atonement
 doosraa, karmkand darshan ko pratipaadit karne ke liye unhone ishwar ke astitv ko bhi nakaar diya tha
 He believed that his philosophy was going to an unacceptable extreme
 ye kaha jaataa he ki shankar ne bhatta ko aatmadah karne kaa sankalp chhodane ke liye manaane kii koshish kii thi, lekin wo jid par ade the
 With a half-burnt body, he was not in a position to debate with Shankar
 lekin jab wo praan tyaag rahe the, unhone shankar ko kaha ki unhen unke shishy mandan mishra ke saath shastrarth karnaa chahie, jo mahishmati main rahete hai
 Many historians believe that Shankar's dramatic encounter with Bhatt is more fiction than truth
 anumaanit rup se, bhatta kaa jivan kaal saatvin sadi isvi kaa doosraa ardhansh tha, or isliye wo shankar ke samakaleen nahin the
 Nevertheless, this offering has been traditionally established in such a way, that its purpose will surely be to bring out the fact that the practices and knowledge-based variations of knowledge prescribed in earlier epistemologies had spread far and wide
 But there were fierce debates
 purv mimasaa ke sarvaadhik mahatvapurn pratipadak kumaril bhatta the or advait ke shankar, isliye un donon kii bhent karai jaani jaruri thi
 It is also true that both of them were almost contemporary, so later biographers covered historical fact with imaginary symbolism, without worrying about chronology or correct dates
 mandan mishra ke saath shastrarth, kumaril bhatta kii salaah ke baad jinase milane ke liye shankar mahishmati gaye the, unke jivan ke sabhi vrutanton main mahatvapurn sthaan rakhata he
 Opinions are quite divided about where Mahishmati is
 kai vrutanton ke anusaar, jinamein madhavacharya kaa shankar digvijaym bhi shaamil he, mandan mishra bihar ke aaj ke saharsa jile main kosi ke tat par based mahishi gaanv ke the
 There are still families in this village who claim that they are descendants of Mandan Mishra
 yahaan ke nivaasiyon kii manyata ke anusaar, mandan mishra ne kumaril bhatta kii bahan, sharada bharti se vivaah kiya tha, jo bihar ke mithila kshetra main bhattapura gaanv kii thim
 On the contrary, there are equally staunch supporters of the view that present-day Maheshwar had an empire on the banks of the Mahishmati Narmada
 or, is kshetra main yatra karte hue, mujhe kam se kam aise teen sthaan mili jo daawa karte hai ki isi jagah par shankar or mandan mishra kaa prasiddh shastrarth hua tha
 The most prominent among these is a temple in Mandleshwar (which is believed to be the new name of Mahishmati), which is very close to the town of Maheshwar
 bade-bade aksharon main ek vishalkay dwaar par ankit haih ‘shri gupteshwar mahadev (gupha) mandir’
 To the right of this gate is a three-dimensional mural on a wall showing statues of Shankar, Mandan Mishra and Bharti Devi, along with a board on which it is here that the famous debate between the two scholars took place
 mandir or uskaa parisar bilkul sunsaan lag rahaa tha
 There was no visible man, not even the priest of the temple
 mandir ke chaaron taraf ek avyavasthit sa bagichaa tha jisamen koi baad nahin thi
 There was another notice board on the wall of the temple which wrote: 1200 years ago, with the Shiva Avatar Adi Shankara and Digvijay Maha Pandit Brahma Avatar Mandan Mishra for the Sanatan Dharma Foundation and World Welfare, 100 yards from the Sri Gupteshwar Temple
 Took place at a distant place
 mandir se kareeb 100 gaj dur sach main ek khuli jagah thi jahaan gooler or bargad ke pedo kii chaaya thi, lekin mandir prabandhan kis aadhaar par itane bharose ke saath kah saktaa tha ki vahi shastrarth kaa vaastavik sthaan tha, ye saaf nahin he
 When we were struggling with this question, the priest of the temple finally showed us
 uske anusaar, kolkata maha milan math ne is vishay par shodh kiya tha
 In 1984, the then head of the monastery, Premanand Kishore, came to Mandaleshwar and built the temple at the place where he believed the debate took place
 pujari is shodh ke samarthan main pramaan dene main asamarth tha, naa hi ham ise math se praapt kar sake
 However, the priest clarified that this place used to be on the banks of Narmada earlier, and today the river has gone a little far, but its water reaches this place during the monsoon
 is kshetra main kam se kam do or sthaan hai jo daawa karte hai ki wo prasiddh shastrarth vahiin hua tha
 One is in Maheshwar, and not far from the luxurious fort built by the Holkar rulers on the banks of the Narmada
 yahaan keval ek chota chabutara he jis par shivlinga or paduka bani he
 The second place is also in Maheshwar, but is more impressive at a short distance from the fort
 ise kadamb van kaha jaataa he, haalanki kele ko chhodkar vahaan mujhe kadamb kaa koi vriksh nahin dikhaa
 There is a plaque in the temple which is claimed to have been debated in this area
 pattica ke upree hisse par shankaracharya, mandan mishra, or sharada bharti ke chitra lage hai
 On the walls of the temple are also large pictures showing the debate
 inamen sabase bade chitra main, shankaracharya or mandan mishra ek-duusare ke saamne vaad-vivaad kii mudra main choti machia par baithe hai, sharada bharti unhen dekh rahi hai or prishthbhumi main badi sankhya main darshak upasthit hai
 Whatever the validity of the mutual claims of these sites, it is true in itself that they are all in the area of the city of Maheshwar and its suburb Mandleshwar a few kilometers away
 is baat par bhi andeh nahin he ki mahishmati madhya bharat, jo ab madhya pradesh he, main ek mahatvapurn pracheen shahar tha
 Historical books state that it was the most important city of the ancient Avanti and Anup kingdoms, and remained a flourishing urban center even during the reign of the Parmar dynasty until it was defeated by Alauddin Khilji in 1305 AD
 kuch jagahon par iske pramaan hai ki mahishmati narmada ke tat par sthit thi, iske dakshin main ujjayini or uttar main pratishthan tha
 This is the place where Maheshwar and Mandleshwar are located today
 isliye, aisa lagata he ki shankaracharya or mandan mishra ke shastrarth vaali jagah, mahishmati, vahiin ho sakati he jahaan aaj maheshwar or mandaleshwar hai
 At least, the people who live here have full faith in this
 haalanki, ham un drushtikon ko bhi puri tarah nakaar nahin sakate jo mahishi ko bihar ke saharsa jile main bataate hai
 Residents here also claim Mandan Mishra with full vigor
 hamaara kaam itihaas ke do vipareet daavon ke sahi yaa galat hone kaa faisla karnaa nahin he, jin donon ke hi samarthan main koi pukhta saboot nahin he
 From the perspective of history, the middle ground may have been that Mandan Mishra came from Bihar, and was born there in the Mahishi village, and later settled in the Mahishmati city of central India
 is baat par vishwaas kiya ja saktaa he kyonki mahishmati ek bada or prasiddh shahar tha, vahaan rajdurbar tha, or darbar ke mukhya pandit kii haisiyat se unke samaan pratishthit vidwaan ko upyukt manch pradaan kar saktaa tha
 Importantly, the eighth chapter of Madhav's Shankar Digvijayam states that the Shastartha took place on the banks of the Reva River, which is another name for the Narmada
 haalanki shankar digvijaym kii sari baton ko aitihaasik rup se bilkul sahi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Whatever be the location, there is considerable dramatization between these two scholars in the fundamental accounts of the great debate, owing to the passionate and ornate narration made by devout biographers
 mana jaataa he ki shankar ke is prashn par ki wo mahishmati main mandan mishra ko kahaan dhundhenge, chita par jalte hue kumaril bhatta ne ye uttar diya tha: ‘tumhen ek aisa ghar milegaa jiske daravaajon par tange pinjaron main tote aise gudh vishyon par charchaa kar rahe honge, “kya veda swamaanya hai yaa wo iske liye kisi bahari prabhaav par nirbhar hai? kya karmon kaa fal sidhaa miltaa he yaa phir uske liye ishwar ko hastkshep karnaa padataa he? kya jagat shaashvat he yaa maatr ek mithyaa he?” jahaan tumhen tote aise jatil darshanik vishyon par charchaa karte milen, tum samaj janaa ki yahi mandan kaa ghar he’
 When Shankar entered Mandan's house, he was not pleased to see Shankar
 wo apane pita kii punya tithi kii prathaon, shraadh main vyast the or ek brahmacharee sanyasi kaa dikhaai padana unki manyataon ke anusaar ashubh tha
 He believed that the right way is to live a householder life and follow the prescribed Vedic practices
 yahi nahin, unka vyavhaar shankar ke prati ruukhaa tha, haalanki shankar isse vichlit nahin hue, or ant main tay hua ki donon vidwaanon ke bich shastrarth agle din prarambh hoga
 Mandan Mishra asks Shankar to choose an intermediary, but is surprised when he says that Mandan's wife, Ubhaya Bharti (sharda Devi) may be the arbitrator
 [kai vidwaanon main is baat par matbhed he ki kya bharti mandan mishra kii patni thim, lekin adhiktar vidwaanon or lok manyataon ke anusaar wo mandan mishra kii patni thim, isliye ham is vivaad ko yaheen chhodte hai
 ] The student agreed to this, and put a garland of flowers around the neck of both contestants, as well as announcing that the one whose garland would wither first would be considered defeated
 ye bhi tay hua ki jo bhi haaregaa, wo apane pratidwandvi kaa anuyaayi banegaa, or uske jivan ke niyamon ko apnayega
 According to different accounts of the incident, the debate between the two lasted for a period of seventeen days to six months
 ant main, mandan mishra ke gale kii maala murajhaane lagi, or ye spasht tha ki shankar ne shastrarth main vijay praapt kar lee thi
 But Ubhaya Bharti was not ready to accept defeat
 unhone kaha ki mishra kii patni ke rup main, wo unki ardhangini hai, or ise hindu dharm main ubhayalingi ardhnarishwar ke rup main manyata bhi mili he
 Therefore, she also wanted to do a debate with Shankar
 shankar aisa nahin karnaa chaahate the, kyonki ek sanyasi ke liye stri se shastrarth karne kii anumati nahin thi
 But Ubhaya Bharti had caught her stubbornness, and Shankar had no choice but to agree
 yahaan par hamen is kahani kaa sabase dilachasp mode pataa chalata he
 Ubhaya Bharti asked Shankar questions on Kama Shastra which were related to sex and pleasure, and which she was familiar with as a married woman, but her rival was completely unaware of being a monk
 phir shankar ne is ‘vigyaan’ ke bare main seekhney ke liye ek maheene kii mohalat maangi, or phir shastrarth main vaapasi ke liye kaha, jis par ubhaya bharti maan gayi
 According to the story, Shankar, by his compound powers, left his body in a cave on the banks of the Narmada, and entered the dead body of King Amaruk, who was being taken for the last rites
 vaise, ye gupha jise gupteshwar gupha ke naam se janaa jaataa tha, abhi bhi mandaleshwar main gupteshwar mandir main pai jaati he
 It is under the temple, and can be reached by stairs
 gupha behad tang he, isaki chattani deevaaron par koi sajaavat nahin he, or farsh par safed tilein lagi hai
 The only statue inside is a stone vagina with a large copper snake in the middle
 raja ke punerjeevit hone ko ek chamatkaar mana gaya, or mrit shaasha ke sharir main shankar mahal main chal die
 There, in the company of the dead king's wives, he learned the arts of rātikriya, and became proficient in Kama Shastra
 or jaisaa unke jeevanikar kehete hai, shankar apane is nae jivan or mahal kii vilasita main itane ram gaye ki wo ye bhi bhul gaye ki unhen ek maheene ke andar gupha main rakhe apane sharir ko punardhaaran karnaa he
 This made his disciples very worried, and sang some philosophical songs in front of him to remind who he really was
 tab shankar apni vishayakt murchha se jage, or jaldi se apane sharir main dobaaraa pravesh kiya, or bilkul ain maukey par unhone aisa kar liya, kyonki gupha main ek maheene tak rakhe rahane ke baad sharir ko raja ke anucharon ne dhundh liya tha or uskaa dah-sanskaar karne vaale the
 Having mastered Kama Shastra, he returned to Mahishmati and successfully answered the questions of Ubhaya Bharati
 shastrarth main wo jeet gaye
 Mandan Mishra wore sanyas and became a disciple of Shankar
 shankar ke manaane par ubhaya bharti ne bhi aisa hi kiya
 This important story needs to be evaluated beyond the colorful details later added by sporadic biographers
 shastrarth vastav main is cheez kaa pratik tha ki reeti-rivaajon se adhik mahatvapurn hai vichaar, or wo aise samay main hua jab iskaa vipareet hi hinduon ke liye jivan style kaa sweekaarya maarg banataa ja rahaa tha
 That is why this story is told as such an important part of Shankar's life
 chhathi or saatvin shatabdi main hindutv kaa punarotthana hua or isaki tulana main buddha dharm kaa patan
 However, this revival was heavily focused on mythology, blind devotion, and more than that, following the Vedic practices established by the believers like Kumaril Bhatt
 kahin naa kahin, in sabamein, vichaaron ke mahatv ko peeche choda ja rahaa tha jo hindu drushti kaa moulik aadhaar tha
 The glorious spiritual insights of the Upanishads were being forgotten in order to follow the exact practices according to the Vedic rules
 mandir fal-phool rahe the, lekin puja ke taur-tareekon or iske peeche kii darshanik soch main asambandhata thi
 Once again there was a need to emphasize the path of enlightenment for salvation, to re-connect Hindutva with its spiritual insights, and to bring back the importance of contemplation
 shankar kaa yahi pratyaksh lakshya tha, or ise prachaarit karne ke liye mandan mishra ko shastrarth main parajeet karne se behatar or koi upama nahin ho sakati thi
 This eminent Pandit of Mahishi was a formidable rival, and his supporters considered him an incarnation of Brahma himself
 nihsandeh wo kumaril bhatta ke sarvaadhik prasiddh shishy the, or mimasaa par kai moulik rachanaaon ke lekhak the jaise mimasaanukramanika, bhaavana-vivek or vidhi-vivek
 Apart from this, he wrote an important work on the philosopher of language, Sphot Siddhi, and wrote a book on the principles of illusion
 isliye shastrarth main shankar se unki paraajay ne bharat bhar main hindutv kii aasthaaon or paramparaon par gaharaa prabhaav daalaa
 Even without modern means of communication, thousands of people saw the progress of the debate and the specifics of the arguments, and then reached thousands more across the country through dialogue with each other
 jab ham is shastrarth ko hindutv ke vikaas ke aitihaasik pariprekshya main dekhte hai to isaki mahatta or bad jaati he, or yahi kaaran he ki shankar ke jivan ke har varnan main ise pramukh sthaan diya gaya he
 The incident of Shankar's work gaining knowledge of scripture is interesting
 kya ye vastav main hui thi, yaa ise hindutv ke vyapak darshan ko saamne laane ke liye joda gaya tha? tarkwaadi is daawey ko nahin maanenge ki shankar ne apana sharir chhodkar yogic shaktiyon ke madhyam se kisi duusare ke sharir main pravesh kiya tha
 Others will say that those who practice Yogic Siddhis are not ignorant of such powers
 haalanki, mul prashn ye he ki ubhaya bharti ne shankar kii pariksha kaam-vaasana ke vishyon par kyon lee, or shankar ne is chunauti ko sweekaar kyon kiya?ek sanyasi ke liye, kaamuktha ishaninda ke samaan thi, or jivan bhar ke liye kii gai pratigyaaon kaa ulanghan bhi
 Even more interesting is that Shankar's biographers have admitted that, along with the queens of the dead king and in the palatial life of the palace, Shankar became so enamored that he had forgotten even his vows of renunciation and the work of literature Wrote a manual by the name of century
 wo aisa kyon karte, or kya isse unke shaareerik sukhon se pare ucch shrenee ke vyaktitv kaa hraas nahin hota he?mere anusaar, iskaa uttar ye he ki is ghatana kaa makasad hindu darshan main chaar purushaarthon kii vaidhata siddh karnaa tha: dharm, arth, kaam or moksh
 Vatsyayana, the author of the Kama Sutra, told centuries before Shankar that following the first three efforts in the right proportion automatically opens the way to the fourth effort, the salvation
 duusare shabdon main, kaam ko ek santulit jivan ke dhaanche main darshanik vaidhata mili hui he
 Shankar may have chosen the life of a monk, where there was no place of meaning and work, but for this reason his relevance to the common people could not be denied
 isliye, is baat kii jarurat thi ki brahmacharya or sansaarik sukhon kaa tyaag karne kii shankar kii vyaktigat ichha ko vyapak hindu darshan main in donon purushaarthon ko mili manyata ke virodh main prastut nahin kiya jaae
 By living the life of a householder, Shankar did not diminish his image of a monk, but broadened his philosophy's charm and reach by removing it from the limited scope of brahmachari ascetics
 mandan mishra shankaracharya ke chaar sarvaadhik mahatvapurn shishyon main ek hue, or (haalanki kuch vidwaan is bindu par sahamat nahin hai) nayaa naam grahan kiya sureshwarachaarya
 He became an eminent scholar of Advaita Siddhanta, and is also credited with being the author of Brahmasiddhi, a book with a sharp eye on the subject
 ye mana jaataa he ki shankar ne unhen shringery math kaa pehla pramukh banaaya, haalanki kanchi math bhi aisa hi daawa karata he
 Ubhaya Bharti, who was believed to be an incarnation of Goddess Saraswati, went to Sringeri with Shankar and her husband, where she died
 shankar ne unki pratishtha main shahar main ek mandir banwaaya, jo aaj bhi maujuud he
 In a sense, she represented the central role of Shakti Siddhanta in Shankar's philosophy

 The news came out soon after Pranab and Chidambaram met the Prime Minister
 gauratlab he ki sonia gandhi ne ultimatum diya tha ki aaj kisi bhi haalat main ye vivaad khatm hona chahie
 After this, Sonia Gandhi met Pranab Mukherjee, AK Antony and Ahmed Patel
 to duusari taraf chidambaram se salmaan khurshid or narayaan sami mili
 Read: Sonia Gandhi's instructions, solve the 2G documents soon
 When Salman Khurshid came out with Chidambaram, he said that all is well
 or isi ke baad congress ne pisi karke kah diya ki vittamantralay ke note main koi nayi baat nahin he or vaise bhi is note se chidambaram par koi aapraadhik aarope sabit nahin hota he
 After this, four party ministers, including Pranab Mukherjee, gave a clean chit to Chidambaram on behalf of the party and the government by holding a joint press conference
 kaha gaya ki chidambaram par hamalaa nahin kiya gaya tha or chidambaram kii bhoomika maamle main andeh ke ghere main nahin he
 By the way, let us tell you that the whole process got entrenched when Chidambaram on Thursday morning indicated to the high command that he should be given a chance to clear his side by holding press talks or else his resignation was accepted
 padhen: pi
 Chidambaram had threatened to resign, the party asked Chidambaram to remain calm and on the other hand, an order was issued to intensify the effort to allay his concerns
 nateeja shaam hote hote vivaad khatm
 By the way, it is also necessary to mention here that the CBI was also seen standing with Chidambaram in the Supreme Court
 sibiai ne adaalat main kaha ki keval chidambaram par aarope lagane ke peeche sidhe taur par raajnneetik makasad lagata he
 The BJP has reacted strongly to the issue of giving a clean chit to Chidambaram in a joint statement of four ministers on the 2G spectrum issue
 bijepi ne kaha he ki pranab mukherjee vitt mantri ko clin chit dene vaale hote koun hai
 BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said that if action had been taken in time, the spectrum scam could have stopped
 unhone kaha, ‘chidambaram ko mantriparishad main rahane kaa koi adhikaar nahin he
 a criminal case should be tried against him
 ’ saath hi bijepi ne 2ji spectrum aavanton masale main pi
 It has also demanded an inquiry into the role of Chidambaram
 bijepi ne is puure masale main chidambaram kii bhoomika kii jaanch sibiai se karaane kii maang kii he
 The BJP has also demanded a criminal case against Chidambaram
 padhen 2ji ghotaale main ab dayaanidhi maaran ke khilaaf hoga exiargauratlab he ki is puure prakaran main vitt mantralay ke ek note ne sara khel bigaadkar rakh diya tha
 It was written in the Finance Ministry's note that if the then Finance Minister p Chidambaram had wanted, the 2G spectrum allocation scam would not have happened
 vitt mantri pranav mukherjee ne bhi sweekaar kiya ki unke mantralai ne piemo ko aisa note bheja tha
 After that, differences between two senior ministers of the government, P
 Chidambaram and Pranab Mukherjee, and the infighting within the Congress came to the fore
 kya he vivaad?2ji spectrum maamle ko lekar vitt mantralay kii ore se 15 march 2011 ko ek note taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 It said that the then Finance Minister (now Home Minister) P
W
 chidambaram chaahate to 2ji spectrum kii nilaamee roak sakate the
 This note was sent to the Prime Minister's Office
 is maamle ke saamne aane ke baad se vipaksh chidambaram ke istife kii maang kar rahaa he
 Janata Party President Subramaniam Swamy has presented this note of the Finance Ministry in the Supreme Court as proof and demanded that if a Raja is guilty then Chidambaram is equally guilty
 vivaad ke baad se chidambaram ab tak 3 baar istipha dene kii peshkash kar chuke hai
 Why increased talk? The main reason for the infighting in the Congress in the 2G case is the finance ministry note which said that if Chidambaram had insisted, this scam would not have happened and the government exchequer would not have suffered so much
 chidambaram kaa kahana he ki unhen yah note kyon nahin dikhaaya gaya jabaki duusari ore pranab mukherjee apane rukh par kaayam hai
 On Wednesday, Mukherjee sent a second note to the PMO, clearly stating that after consulting the PMO and several ministries, the finance ministry had prepared the note in which Chidambaram's role in the 2G scam was pointed out
 padhein: sushamaa swaraj ne kaha, raja jitne hi doshi hai chidambaramakya hai halaat?2ji maamle main congress ke andar jari kalah ke bich maujuuda halaat ye hai ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh or congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi jaldi se jaldi is vivaad kaa samaadhaan chaahate hai
 In this connection, the round of meetings continues continuously
 mukherjee bhi chindbaram ko mahatvapurn sahyogi bataa chuke hai
 However, Chidambaram is very angry and has offered a resignation
 vipaksh kaa rukh2ji maamle par vipaksh grahamantri pi chidambaram ke istife kii lagaataar maang kar rahaa he
 However, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has defended Chidambaram, saying that the opposition is eager to hold elections soon, so it is trying to destabilize the government
 bijepi ne kaha he ki maamle main chidambaram utane hi doshi hai jitne e raja
 The BJP has even said that we do not need to topple the government, but the government will reach its end by its own actions

 beete somvaar ko patrakaron se baatcheet ke dauraan nitish kumaar ne tejasvi ko baccha kahkar kya sambodhit kiya uske baad se hi tejasvi yadav nitish par lagaataar aakraamak bane hue hai
 Nitish Kumar asked for Tejashwi that he has the nature of his father Lalu Prasad Yadav, while replying to this, Tejashwi Yadav said that he is proud that he has the nature of his father and the shadow is visible but Tejashwi gave Nitish Asked Kumar, can Nitish keep his hand on his heart and say that his son has his nature? Speaking via Twitter, Nitish Kumar said that while talking about family, he said Politics also do not want to take the low level of negativity like Nitish Kumar, but very familiar Nitish Kumar truth and give them to rule the kingdom! Esteemed Nitish ji, i am proud that i have tempered my father
 lekin aap dil par haath rakhkar bataayen kya aapke bete main aapkaa swabhaav he? sidhi baat no bakawaas
 Like you, you do not want to take politics to a low level but you are well aware of the truth
 raaj ko raaj hi rahane do
 - Tejashwi Yadav (@yadavtejashwi) November 15, 2017 Attacking Nitish Kumar, Tejashwi Yadav said that nowadays there is an undeclared war between Nitish and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi about who is going to a low level and how much personal comment of Lalu Prasad Will do against the family
 tejasvi ne kaha ki nitish kumaar susheel modi kii tarah nimna str kii baaten karke unki jagah lenaa chaahate hai
 Tejashwi said that Nitish Kumar cannot oppose him on a political and ideological level as he has no left of his own thoughts, policy, principles and principles, hence he has come down to some personal remarks against Lalu and his family
 tejasvi ne kaha ki nitish kumaar ne bihar main koi ek aisi party nahin bachi jisase gathbandhan nahin kiya ho
 Tejashwi said that till date Nitish Kumar has not been able to form a government on his own
 tejasvi ne kaha kirashtriya janata dal kaa janadharato angad ke paanv he, is par jitna jor lagegaa utana majboot hoga par tus se mas nahin hoga

 All the booth in-charge have been asked to maintain a front at their booth before 7 am on the day of polling
 bijepi alaakaman ne matdaan kendron ko ‘shakti centre’ kaa naam diya he
 a polling station has at least three booths
 adhik aabaadi vaale kshetron main ek matdaan centre main aath se das booth bhi ho sakate hai
 The party has created an incharge of every 'shakti Kendra', above which there is a responsibility of coordination among all the booths coming to the polling station

 This is the reason why Prime Minister Modi and BJP President in their home state of Gujarat, who never cared for the displeasure of veteran leaders like Keshubhai Patel, Kanshi Ram Rana, Vallabhbhai Kathiria, Suresh Mehta and Govardhan Jhadapia, now left the Congress to win the election

 This includes declaring the crop to be spoiled when it is not actually spoiled and smuggled instead of burning the husk

 ) Melbourne Cricket Stadium must have seen many historical and memorable moments of cricket history
 lekin 30 disambar to yahaan ke jarre-jarre main bas gaya
 This was not a normal cricket match
 lekin isaki bhanak naa to team india ke kisi khilaadi ko thi or mejabaan team ko
 Except for Mahendra Singh Dhoni, captain of Team India
 captain number van dhoni ne safed jersey ko kaha alavidajab melbern ke is maidan main aakhri ball khelkar dhoni waapas pavilion laut rahe the to wo behad saamaanya the
 However, by then Dhoni held many records
 sabase zyada stamping karne vaale wicketiper ban gaye
 Tests, odis and T20s together became the captain to score more than ten thousand runs in all three formats
 lekin jis dhoni ko world cap jeetne ke baad jamaane ne bilkul shant dekha, wo bhala in kamyaabiyon par kya jashn manaata
 The truth is that something else was going on in Dhoni's mind
 kuch aisa, jo team india ke cricket itihaas main sabase bada bhuuchaal laane vaala tha
 No one realized that Dhoni had now taken off the white jersey and this stadium in Melbourne was recorded in history in such a way that the most successful captain of India left the Test bat right here
 team india to is baat se raahat kii saans le rahi thi ki chalo haar se to batch gaye
 But there was a lot of upheaval in Dhoni's heartbreak
 haalanki wo upar se bilkul saamaanya dikh rahe the
 At the same time, in the dressing room, Dhoni called BCCI secretary Sanjay Patel
 dhoni-sanjay, main dhoni bol rahaa hum
 
 
 How are you? 
 
 sanjay-main acha hum
 
 
 Why did you call suddenly? 
 Dhoni - i have made up my mind to leave the Test captaincy
 
 
 sanjay-are
 
 
 What happened, which you took such a big decision
 
 
 dhoni-yahi nahin, main to test se sanyas bhi lene ja rahaa hum
 
 
 Sanjay - what happened Dhoni
 
 
 kya aap chotil hai yaa koi or baat he
 
 
 Dhoni - No, i have decided and done something thoughtfully
 
 
 sanjay-acha
