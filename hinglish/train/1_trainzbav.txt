 One arrest falls all over Mumbai Police arrests 43-year-old Shyam Manohar Rai

 In the same case, when the police interrogates him, suddenly Sudden opinion suggests that he has committed many crimes in the past

 Rai was the person who reveals for the first time that after killing, he burnt and buried the corpse in the jungles of Raigad

 Finally, the police arrested Indrani Mukherjee from her house in Mumbai on Tuesday evening as soon as the revelations and preliminary evidence of confession of confession came to hand
 sutron ke mutabik pehle to indrani na sirf raay ke iljaamon se inkaar karti raheen balki yahi kahati raheen ki shina unki bahan he or teen saal se america main rah rahi he
 But when Rai and her face were made, she finally broke down and confessed to the murder
 beti ke saath achche nahin the rishtepulice sutron ke mutabik indrani ne mana ki shina ke saath uske rishte achche nahin the
 One day in 2012, Indrani called Sheena to meet her in Bandra on the pretext of resolving the ongoing dispute between the two, and then put her in a car

 After this, Sheena was strangled to death in the car itself

 According to Peter Mukherjee, he had become famous with Peter, and till now he was unaware of this truth and now that the story of Sheena's murder has come to light, he too has come to know this truth

 President Pranab Mukherjee said on Tuesday that we need another struggle for independence
 is baar yah sunishchit karne ke liye doosraa swatantraaa sangram ladanaa hoga ki bharat bhukh, beemaari or garibi se hameshaa ke liye mukt ho jaae
 Mukherjee quoted former President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan as saying that economic progress is one of the tests of democracy
 raashtrapati ne aagaah kiya ki yadi loktantric sansthaaon par prahaar hua to desh main avyavashtha fail jaaegi
 Without directly mentioning the protests against the corruption of Anna Hazare and Ramdev, the President underlined the dangers of undermining institutions like Parliament
 desh ke 66wein swatantraaa diwas kii purvasandhya par raashtra ke naam apane sandesh main mukherjee ne kaha ki bhrashtachar kii mahamari ke khilaaf gussa or andolan jaays he kyonki yah mahamari hamaare desh kii kshamta kaa hraas kar rahi he
 He said that sometimes the public loses its patience but it cannot be used as an excuse to attack our democratic institutions
 raashtrapati ne kaha ki ye sansthaaen samvidhan ke darshneey stambh hai or yadi in stambhon main daraar aayi to samvidhan kaa adarshavaad nahin rah saktaa
 He said that these institutions act as a 'meeting point' between the principles and the public
 ho saktaa he ki hamaari sansthaaen samay kii susti kaa shikaar hon lekin iskaa jawaab yah nahin he ki jo nirmit kiya gaya he, use dhwast kiya jaae
 Rather, they should be remodeled so that they become stronger than before
 sansthaaen hamaari aazaadee kii abhibhavak hai
 Mukherjee said that the work of legislating cannot be taken away from the legislature
 janata ko apana asantosh vyakt karne kaa adhikaar he
 He said that when officers become authoritarian, democracy is affected, but when there are agitations on the matter, chaos spreads

 We win or lose together

 Parliament will run with its calendar and rhythm
 unhone kaha ki kabhi kabhaar yah lay bina taan kii lag sakati he lekin loktantr main hameshaa faisle kaa din aata he or vah hota he chunaav
 Parliament is the soul of the people and India
 ham iske adhikaron or kartavyon ko apane jokhim par chunauti dete hai
 Mukherjee said that he is not saying this in the spirit of preaching but instead he is appealing for a better understanding of the existential issues which remain hidden behind the worldly façade
 unhone kaha ki loktantr ko javabdehi kii mahaan sanstha 'swatantra chunaavon' ke jariye shikayaton ke samaadhaan ke liye behtareen avasar kaa vardaan praapt he
 Mukherjee said that there is a need for vigilance at the borders and it should be consistent with internal vigilance
 hamen apane rajtantr, nyaaypalika, karypalika or vidhayika ke un kshetron main vishwasaneeyata barkaraar rakhni chahie jahaan shaayad santosh, thakaan yaa janasevak ke galat aacharan ke kaaran kaam rukaa hua ho
 Referring to the economy, he said that the growth rate has reached eight percent in the last seven years at an annual average rate of one percent in 1947
 desh main sookhe or baadh kii maujuuda sthiti kii charchaa karte hue unhone kaha ki mudrasphiti visheshkar khaadya mudrasphiti chintaa kii vajah bani hui he
 The President said that food availability is good but we cannot forget the condition of those people, who made it possible even in a year of dull conditions i
e

 The country should also stand with them in their crisis
 unhone apane bhaashan main dakshin asian kshetreey sahyog sangh (dakshes) ke mahatv kaa ullekh karte hue kaha ki 27 saal pehle bana yah manch aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf ladai kaa upyukt jawaab he
 Mukherjee said that the SAARC should gain enthusiasm to fulfill its mandate
 aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf saajha ladaai main ise ek bade hathiyaar ke rup main kaam karnaa chahie
 The Assam Accord needs to be re-discussed: Emphasizing that the Pranabhinam-infested Assam will start the process of healing the wounds of the people, President Pranab Mukherjee said that the historic Assam Accord needs to be rethought and it should be given a sense of justice and national interest Should be adapted to the existing conditions
 swatantraaa diwas kii purvasandhya par raashtra ke naam apane pehle sambodhan main mukherjee ne kaha ki assam ke jakhmon ko bharne ke liye thos prayaas kiye gayi, jinamein assam samjhauta bhi shaamil he, jo hamaare yuva evam priy purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi kaa vichaar tha
 We should discuss it again and it should be adapted to the prevailing circumstances in the spirit of justice and national interest
 jaateey samoohon ke bich tanaav par chintaa vyakt karte hue unhone kaha ki hamaare desh kii sthirataa ke liye khatra banane vaali puraani aag puri tarah buji nahin he
 Smoke still continues from that
 mukherjee ne kaha ki hamaare alpsankhyakon ko aghat se suraksha, tasalli or samaj kii jarurat he
 Violence is not an option, but violence invites violence far greater than itself
 unhone kaha ki nayi aarthik behatari ke liye kshetra main shanti jaruri he jo hinsa kii pratispardhi vajahon ko shant kar sakati he
 Clashes between Bodo and Bangladeshi immigrants in lower Assam districts killed at least 77 people and left nearly four lakh people homeless
 olympic main behtareen pradarshan ke liye raashtrapati ne di khiladiyon ko badhailandan olympic main bharat ke ricard pradarshan ke liye khiladiyon ko badhai dete hue raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne ummid jataayi ki rio di jenro main hone vaale agle olympic main desh ke khilaadi or adhik padak jeetenge

 Australia may have an unbeatable lead in the four Test matches but captain Michael Clarke said it would be disappointing if his team failed to achieve a 4–0 whitewash result against India
 australian team pehle hi is shrinkhalaa main 3-0 se ajey badhat bana chuki he or donon timen ab 24 janvari se edilade ovel main shuru hone vaale antim test main ek duusare ke saamne hongi
 Clarke wrote in his column in 'the Telegraph', 'we are thinking of only one thing in the final Test against India
 
 Whitewash
 is majboot bhartiya team ke khilaaf agar ham 4-0 se jeet darj nahin kar paye to yah ham sabhi ke liye niraashajanak hoga
 The Australian captain admitted that it was satisfying to capture the series in Perth itself, especially against a team that holds the world number two ranking
 unhone likhaa, ‘perth main shrinkhalaa apane naam karnaa santoshjanak tha
 It was a great achievement against the world number two team (before the series started)
 ’clark ko lagata he ki abhi unki team kaa kaam puraa nahin hua he or vah or unki team ke khilaadi shrinkhalaa 4-0 se jeetne main koi chook nahin karnaa chaahate
 He said, 'all the players take pride in it
 lekin abhi kaam khatm nahin hua he
 We have done well after a disappointing defeat to New Zealand in Hobart about a month ago and now we do not want to falter again
 ’captain ko lagata he ki edilade main bharat kaa saamana karnaa ‘kathin’ hoga
 He said, 'I expect the Adelaide Test to be the toughest
 edilade ovel aamtaur par ballebaaji wicket he or is par desh kii anya pichon ko dekhte hue oochaal kii kami he
 To be fair, it is suited to India's domestic conditions, which will cause a lot of difficulty for our bowlers
 ’ clark ne apane kalam main yah bhi likhaa ki australian team is stadium main 1999-00 shrinkhalaa ke baad se bharat ko nahin haraa saki he
 Let me tell you that the United States had declared to be out of the United Nations Human Rights
 maanavadhikaar parishad main sudhaar na hone kii vajah se america lambey samay se baahar hone kii dhamkee detaa aayaa he
 The US alleges that this 47-member council is anti-israel
 america ke videsh mantri mike pompiyo or sanyukt raashtra ke liye america kii doot niki heli ne ek saajha press conference kar is baat kii ghoshnaa kii
 Nikki Haley said that the US is pulling out of the UN Human Rights Council
 america teen saal se sanyukt raashtra maanavadhikaar parishad kaa sadsy tha
 America had just completed a year and a half in this council
 beete dinon yah khabar ai thi ki parishad main sudhaaron par sahmati nahin bani thi or america kii maangon ko nahin mana gaya tha
 Since then it was reported that the US would withdraw from the United Nations Human Rights Council
 (input-bhashaa) Dhruv Tyagi was killed on 11 th in Basidera Pur, Delhi for protesting against the molestation of his daughter
 jabaki unka betaa anmol tyaagi gambhir haalat main aspataal main bhartee he
 The people of Basidera Pur village held a panchayat in protest against Dhruv Tyagi's murder and passed a proposal not to rent houses to a particular community in the village
 dhruv tyaagi ko shradhanjali dene ke liye basaidara poor gaanv main dilli or aasapaas ke rahane vaale hajaaron log pahunche
 In this, people from many outside states and Hinduist organizations started giving inflammatory speeches on the pretext of giving praise
 haalanki dhruv tyaagi ke bujurg pita ne kai baar unhen rokane kii koshish kii
 Many people also appealed to the people associated with the organization not to do politics
 lekin uske baavjood shradhanjali dene ke liye bulaai panchayat main ek samudaay vishesh ke logon ko basaidara poor gaanv main kiraye par makaan na dene kaa prastaav paas kar diya gaya
 All India Tyagi Mahasabha general secretary Ambarish Tyagi said, "we have decided in the panchayat that people of a particular community will neither be given a house nor a shop
" dhruv tyaagi kii hatya ke virodh main pehle panchayat phir hajaaron logon ne motinagar chauraahey par jam laga diya, jahaan ghanton log pareshaan rahe
 Although Delhi Police has arrested six people associated with this murder, the largest market for making and selling fans in Delhi is Basidera Pur village
 yahaan kareeb paanch se chah hajaar upi or bihar kaa majdoor kaam karte hai
 This decision of the panchayat will have an impact on the livelihood of thousands of laborers of the hired minority community who have nothing to do with this dreadful incident
 sansad hamalaa maamle ke doshi aatanki afjal guru ke samarthan main jawahar laal uniwarsity (jeenyu) main kaarykram yojit karne vaala 28 varshiya chaatr umr khalid ghatana ke ek saptaah baad bhi faraar he
 Meanwhile, Omar's father said on Friday, 'if the atmosphere is fine, i will appeal to him to surrender
 ' afjal ke pita simi ke purv sadsy rahe hai or is samay raajnneeti main sakriy hai
 Significantly, anti-india slogans were raised at the event held at the JNU campus
 ghatana se sambandhit chah chaatro par police ne aarope lagaaya he, jisamen se keval ek-kanhaiya kumaar ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 Police have conducted raids in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh in search of these students, but so far they have failed
 khalid kii bahan ne NDTV se baatcheet main kaha, 'mujhe kaha gaya he ki bharat mata ke naam par ham tumhaare ghar aakar tumhen maar denge, tumhaare saath rape karenge
 His face was covered for not revealing identity

 BJP and its supporters say that people like Kanhaiya and Omar Khalid should not be spared for sloganeering and rhetoric related to the partition of the country and for supporting Afzal Guru
 gauratlab he afjal ko varsh 2001 main sansad par hue hamale ke maamle main doshi maanate hue teen saal pehle faansee di gai thi
 In the video clip related to the JNU incident, Khalid is seen targeting the government for hanging Afzal while shouting slogans for the independence of Kashmir
 umr ke pita saiyad kasim eliyas ne NDTV se baatcheet main kaha, 'umr ne jo naare lagaae, usamen se kuch kaa main samarthan nahin karata lekin kya afjal guru kii prashansa karnaa deshadroh mana ja saktaa he?' eliyas ke anusaar, unhone stadent islamic movement of india (simi) ise aatanki sanghathan ke rup main pratibandhit kiye jane ke pehle hi chhod diya tha

 Shobha Mohanparyatan only means temporary and there is little more tourism in the beauty
 aisi koi jagah nahin, jahaan dher sara dijal-petrol na phunken
 Add to this all the amenities that are served in the name of luxury, and then you will not be surprised at all that our every journey, stay and walk - all are carbon negative
 haalanki ghoomana-phirana apane aap main ek lagjri he, phir bhi ham paryaton ke sakaaratmak paksh ko nakaar nahin sakate
 Efforts should be made on how to balance the ill effects of tourism
 ab aise logon kii taadaad bad rahi he jo jaanane-samajhane, man ko ekagra karne or nai urja ke saath lautne ke liye yatraaen kar rahe hai
 Therefore, if we present luxury in a new trend, then every tourism can become a great sight to see and roam our beautiful earth
 jo baat sabase pehle dimag main aati he, vah he dhime chalanaa
 Easy food and slow travel can be a cultural shift in the direction of slowing down the pace of everything, so that our aim is not to travel around the world to touch specific places and eat only food that is posted on Instagram are
 ham kam jagahon kii yatra karen or tab lagjri yah hogi ki ham tasalli se jaaen or har jagah aaraam se ghumen or ve saare kaam karen jo ghisi-pity li par na hon
 Let us enjoy every aspect of the place to the fullest — food, heritage, culture, people — and then a long stay at some place is considered luxury
 teji se vyavsaayik hoti duniya main hamen jin chizon se samjhauta karnaa pad rahaa he, vah he samay, swasthya or apane aasapaas ke logon se hamaare rishte
 Luxury tourism of the new trend should be aimed towards returning all these things and professionalism should also mold itself towards focusing on all these issues
 nunatam dizin, paryaavaran-anukool vaastushilp ho yaa heritage imaaraton ko nae makasad se dhaala jaae, mehmaanon ko vyaktigat sevaayen milen, jinhen unke cameraa number kii jagah naamon se sambodhit kiya jaae
 In this way you can return to a more connected world
 bageeche is tarah se phir se sangrakshit kiye jaaen ki unamem titliyon, pakshiyon or anya jeev-jantuon kaa prakritik sthaan bane
 This symbiosis should be a lesson in living in harmony
 aise paryaton main khaasiyat yah ho ki aap aisi jagah rahen jahaan apane aap hi aapkaa digital sampark tut jaae kyonki vahaan na internet ho or na mobile connactivity taaki parivaar aapas main milakar samay or sthaneey kheton or kichan garden main organic utpaadon se taiyaar bhojan kaa lutf uthaaen
 This will increase the trend of food from farm to table in place of the food waste wastage
 jalwaayu parivartan hamaare daravaajon par dastak de chukaa he, aise main har vyavsaay ko tamaam udyogon main ho rahi jyadatiyon kii chunautiyon kaa saamana karne ke liye khud ko taiyaar karnaa hoga
 In luxury tourism of the new trend, the responsibility should also be put on the tourists to choose the brand which is aware of this crisis and is also taking steps in this direction, such as not using plastic, especially single-use plastic
 Work towards water harvesting, be active in recycling of waste and its disposal in a safe manner and use the responsibility of land and other resources In La
 vah din dur nahin jab sailaani in maanakon ke aadhaar par apane thaharne kaa intjaam karenge
 Actually, the time has come to do this! It is a hypocrisy that big companies should talk about responsible luxury, but open new hotels in areas where there are already plenty of hotels
 kehane kaa matlab yah ki nae chalan ke lagjri travel ko mukhyadhara kaa hissaa bananaa hoga or use sarkaar ke paryaton ghoshnaptr main shaamil karnaa hoga
 To increase the trend of luxury travel of the new trend, it is necessary that industry should adopt it and people will find it attractive
 aatithy-satkar udyog sthaneey samudaayon ke prati javabdehi se bhaag nahin saktaa
 First of all, it should be tied that the local people have the right over local resources and they are given to the tourists on rent for use only
 viraasat or prakruti kaa sangrakshan, gaiyr-motor gatividhiyaan, samudaay se meljol va unke jeevanyaapan par sakaaratmak prabhaav, amoort saanskrithik viraasat ko rekhaankit karnaa, bhoomi va sansaadhan ke istemaal ko lekar samvedansheel hona—ye sab nae chalan ke lagjri saiyr-sapata ke maanak ho sakate hai
 The trends of urban migration regarding all these tourism will also be reduced
 mujhe yakeen he ki jaagrukta bad jaae to har sailaani apane hisaab se apni har yatra main tareeke se is tarah ke vikalp chun saktaa he jinase antat: uskaa carbon footprint kam ho jaae
 Change from climate change now becomes a compulsion and we should move towards the new trend of tourism before the next generations pressurize us, that is the way left

 Nikita says that whatever we want to do, we should do it with all our heart

 Nikita's mother is not educated at all, but she always understood the importance of reading to her daughter
 skool ke dinon main jab nikita ke pita nahin rahe tab bhi maa ne beti ko bete se kam nahin samajha
 When Nikita was to go to Indore to study, the elder brother had natural concerns about his sister

 After surveying the city for a week, she chose two sites for the blast, the famous Dagdu Halwai Seth Temple and the German Bakery

 Controversial Australian umpire Daryl Harper has accused Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni of trying to threaten him during the first Test against the West Indies
 bharatiyon ne pehle test main unki kharaab ampiring kii aalochana kii thi
 Harper decided to withdraw from the third Test after criticism from Indian players
 unhone kaha ki dhoni ko kharaab ampiring kii tippanee karne ke liye sajaa milani chahie thi
 Also Harper said that he was forced to break his silence due to the ICC not taking any action against Dhoni
 harper ne kaha ki tej gendbaaj praveen kumaar ko lagaataar pich par daudane ke kaaran jab gendbaaji se hataa diya gaya to dhoni ne unhen daraane kii koshish kii thi
 According to Cricinfo, Harper said that Dhoni came to him and said that Daryl has had problems with you in the past, which this umpire has taken as an attempt to bully him
 harper ne kaha, maine baad main sochaa ki uskaa matlab kya tha ki main aisa ampire tha jise koi bhi khilaadi yaa team yaa board prabhavit nahin kar paaya tha
 He also could not scare me
 harper ne yah bhi kaha ki dhoni ko match ke baad hui conferes main kii gai tippanee ke liye sajaa milani chahie thi
 Dhoni had said, if the right decisions had been taken in the match, then the match would have been over already and i would have reached the hotel by now
 harper ne kaha, yah meri raay he ki use sajaa milani chahie thi
 Her comments were inappropriate
 mujhe lagata he ki yah tippanee nishchit rup se anuchit thi
 ICC Cricket General Manager David Richardson also termed the criticism made by Dhoni unfair but neither he nor match referee Jeff Crowe accused the Indian captain of violating the code of conduct
 harper ne isisi ko latada kyonki vah bharat ke khilaadiyon or media ke dabaav main aisa nahin kar saki or isi ke kaaran unhen carabian shrinkhalaa main ek match pehle hi sanyas lenaa padaa
 "I am very disappointed with the ICC management, which allowed this to happen," he said
 aamir khan kii sarfarosh ke sikval kaa hissaa nahin rahe jon abraham
 Confirmed by director John Matthew Maithon
 aksar bollywood main aise kisse sunne ko milte hai jab diarector or actor ke matbhedon ke kaaran actor ko film chhodani padati he
 One such news has surfaced once again
 aamir khan kii film sarfarosh ke sikval se jon abraham ne apana haath peeche khinch liya he
 Confirming John's exit from the film, film director John Matthews stated that things were not sitting properly between John Abraham and him
 jon abraham film main ek abhinayta ke saath saath ko-produsar bhi the
 Let me tell you that only last year John Abraham agreed to this film
 pitiai ko die ek intervyuu main jon ne kaha, "jon mathew mathan or main film ko-produs kar rahe hai
 Our work on scripting is still in progress
 film kii shooting agle saal tak shuru kar di jaaegi
 John also told that, after watching Sarfarosh, John Mathew is the only director whose house John had praised him for directing the film and said 'yaar kya hai film hai'
 mid-de ke saath baatcheet ke mutabik nirdeshak jon mathew mathan ke bayaan ne sabko chaunkaa diya
 He said that 'I had never confirmed that John is doing my film, nor have i yet mentioned any other actor's name in the media
 aage diarector jon mathew ne ye bhi kaha ki unhen is baat kii jaankaree nahin ki jon abraham ne kya kaha tha
 Director John Mathew told that talks were going on between him and John Abraham about the film, but this conversation could not reach any conclusion
 philhal diarector mathew scrypting ko phinishing dene main jute hue hai
 According to director Matthew, he would not comment on casting until he signed someone
 ek report ke mutabik, pichley 7 maheenon se jon or diarector mathew ke bich film kii scrypting ko lekar baat jari thi par koi safalataa haath nahin lag saki
 a spokesman for John Abraham has also confirmed that, "we were in discussions with John Maithon for Sarfarosh 2
 lekin kuch baat nahin ban pai
 We wish the best for this project "
 philhal jon abraham aage badhate hue apni baaki kii filmon kii taiyaari main lag gaye hai
 He is currently shooting for Anees Bazmee's 'pagalpanti'
 saath hi jon film bottla house main bhi vyast hai
 Last year John shot for the film in Lucknow and Jamia Nagar, Delhi
 bottla house kii kahani kathith taur par disipi sanjeev kumaar yadav ke kirdaar par aadhaarit he, jinhone dilli main police adhikariyon or aatankwaadi samooh, indian mujahidin ke sadasyon ke bich hui muthbhed ke dauraan batla house encounter ko anjaam diya tha
 The film is scheduled to release on August 15, 2019
 july se vah rencil di silva ke antitald drama par kaam karnaa shuru kar denge, jisaki kahani bike racing ke ird-gird gumti he
 Hi
 
 i am Ravish Kumar
 unhone sahi kaha ki ye kya he
 Do i have to understand its definition first? defnishan mane paribhaasha
 In the above line, he is Home Minister Rajnath Singh and in Yeh Hai Hai Yeh Hai Love Jihad
 jab 12 sitambar ko yani uttar pradesh main matdaan se 24 ghante pehle dilli main samvaadadaata ne grahamantri se poocha ki rashtriya swanyasevak sangh ke mukhpatr panchajnya ne iske upar puri story chhaapi he
 There is a campaign going on all over the country, you do not believe so
 to isi ke jawaab main rajnath singh ne kaha ki ye kya he
 While the issue of Love Jihad was not only made on behalf of BJP, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Sangh, but it also gave unauthorized and self-judicial figures of credibility in its favor
 to kya rajnath singh matdaan se 24 ghante pehle bhaanp gaye the ki nafrat failaa kar vot maangane kii ranneeti fail ho gai he
 After all, why did BJP put forward Mahant Adityanath, who remained confined to his constituency till the Lok Sabha elections, with big ministers like Rajnath Singh, VK Singh, Uma Bharti
 13 agast ko loksabhaa main jab congress kii maang par sampradayik hinsa par bahes hui, to bijepi ne jawaab dene ke liye sabase pehle mahant adityanath ko utaara
 That speech was quite aggressive
 bijepi ne upi ke liye chunaav abhiyaan samiti main teenon logon ko rakhaa
 Kalraj Mishra, Lakshminarayan Mishra and Mahant Adityanath
 mahant adityanath ko star prachaarak kii suchi main rakhaa gaya
 To make the campaign aggressive, the jihad of Love Jihad was raised and it was also addressed in the Mathura Executive, but could not be a part of the proposal
 mahant adityanath lav jihad par bolte rahe
 The Election Commission ordered an FIR to be filed against Adityanath for inciting religious sentiments in Noida seeking votes
 bijepi yaheen nahin ruki
 Along with Adityanath, Unnao MP Sakshi Maharaj was launched, who started targeting the madrasas saying that the tricolor is not hoisted on August 15
 to kai logon ne soshal media par aisi tasviren laga deen ki dekhiye ke bachche madrase main tirangaa fahraa rahe hai
 Look at the newspapers on 6 and 7 September
 lodh netaa banakar maidan main utre sakshi maharaj kehane lage ki madrason main lav jihad kaa shadyantra chal rahaa he, vah baqayda iske rate rakhte hai ki agar sardaar kii ladki ho to 9 lakh, agar jain kii ladki ho to, 8 lakh or agar hindu kii ladki ho to saat lakh rupee die jaaenge, unhen pyaar main fansaa kar shaadi karne ke liye
 This money is coming from Arab countries
 in baton kaa koi pramaan nahin he, magar whats ap or soshal media ke zariye yah zehar failaa diya gaya ki aisa ho rahaa he
 Perhaps Home Minister Rajnath Singh would have known this truth better, which also showed in his answer what love jihad is
 lekin rajnath singh ne samay par ise roka kyon nahin? kahin vah anjaan banakar ise jari rahane kii chhot to nahin de rahe the
 Is this sub-mandate against the politics of love jihad i
e
 naftar
 agar nahin to ve koun se kaaran hai jinke aadhaar par bijepi ke kharaab pradasharn ko samajha jaae
 In Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP won 73 seats in the Lok Sabha four months ago, it will lose 8 of its 11 seats in the assembly and have to be content with only 3
 inamen se ek seat rohaniya pradhanmantri ke kshetra varanasi kii he, jahaan bijepi 7805 voton se haar gai
 It was from Rohania that Narendra Modi started electoral campaigning in Benaras
 vahaan anupriya patel kii maa haari hai
 Charkhari, who has been vacated by Uma Bharti, has BJP number three and lost by 50,805 votes
 sapa sarkaar ke khilaaf muslim tushtikaran se lekar kanoon vyavastha kaa mudda banaaya gaya, lekin samaajawaadee party 8 siton par jiti or mainpuri loksabhaa upachunaav main bhi bijepi ko haraa diya
 With this, the SP family has 5 members in the Lok Sabha
 parivaarwaad bhi chal hi gaya
 At the same time, the difference of bjp's victory in Saharanpur, Lucknow East and Noida varies from 18 thousand to 50 thousand
 yogi adityanath ab mahant adityanath ho gaye hai or upi main chaar maheene pehle mahant bani bijepi gaddi se kuch neeche utar gai he
 In the name of love jihad, BJP could not get public love
 bijepi kii haar kii is laghugaatha main pashchim bengal se bhi ek khabar he
 Fifteen years later, there is a BJP MLA there
 bashirhaat dakshin seat par bijepi ne 1500 maton se jeet hasil kii he
 The Trinamool won the Chowringhee seat, but the CPM did not get a single seat
 khaas baat ye he ki isse pehle 1999 main ashokanagar vidhansabha seat se bijepi ke badal bhattacharya vidhayak chune gaye the, vah bhi tab jab bijepi or trinmul ne saath chunaav ladaa tha
 But in Gujarat, the Congress has won three seats with its occupation and in Rajasthan, Sachin Pilot has made his comeback in front of Vasundhara by taking three of the four seats
 uttarakhand main congress se teen or bihar main congress rajd or jediu gathbandhan ke saamne 6 siten haar jane ke baad use laga ki upi se jawaab mil jayega
 Therefore, the BJP put great emphasis in UP
 aakhir aisa hua kyon? sarkaar or party ke bich behatar talmail rahe iske liye amit shah ko party kaa adhyaksh banaaya gaya
 Amidst all this, the Jan Dhan Yojana, the successful visit to Japan, the agreement to make Kashi Kyoto, the controversial master stroke of Teachers' Day, the improvement of GDP, the rise of the SENSEX, everything was going well
 phir bhi in up chunaavon main bijepi ke achche din kyon nahin aae? akhilesh yadav or sachin payalat ke kaise aa gaye? Special moment: bjp's prime ministerial candidate Bannamodi wave - 2 million people connect every week on his Facebook page
 yahi nahin, unki pasandida dress ko modi kurta naam diya gaya he
 - 60 lakh people have attended their rallies across the country
 agar koi ek aisa shaks he, jisane 2013 main raajnneeti kii disha badali he, to ve hai 63 varshiya narendra damodar das modi
 As the prime ministerial candidate of the BJP and its chief campaigner in the 2014 elections, Modi has done more than completely overthink the thinking of the world's most vocal democracy
 yah shaks sandesh or sandeshvahak donon ban gaya he
 Modi's call to awaken the new consciousness in the country has shocked those who feel betrayed by the present rulers sitting in Delhi
 vikaas kii unki pukaar ne un logon ko ummid dilaai he, jo thahari hui arthvyavastha se niraash hai
 The messenger is equally dominating
 modi apni party se upar uth gaye hai or rock star kii tarah kaam kar rahe hai
 They are playing fiercely with the public mind
 unka karishma, unke jujharupan, unke aakrosh or prashaasak ke rup main unki uplabdhiyaan, unki mahatvakanksha se mail khaati hai
 Modi's path was not so easy
 sabase pehle june main party kii prachaar samiti kaa adhyaksh ghoshit hone ke liye unhen party ke bheetar virodh ko kuchalanaa padaa
 Senior leader LK Advani boycotted the executive in protest
 phir bhi party adhyaksh rajnath singh ko kaaryakartaaon ke dabaav ke aage jhukna padaa
 When Modi was announced as the prime ministerial candidate before the assembly elections in September, the situation had changed and Advani could not resist
 modi ab party ke baahar virodhiyon ko jeetne kii koshish main hai, chaahe ve musalmaan hon yaa unhen baantne vaala netaa maanane vaale log
 They are busy winning the hearts of the poor by reminding them of their days of selling tea
 soshal media par badhate samarthan se modi kaa prabhaav jaahir hota he
 Not only are the right-wing cyber-hindus generally pro-rss and BJP, but there are also new supporters of Modi who feel that they have solutions to every problem and they cannot do anything wrong
 modi ne jo aandhi paidaa kii he or upie kaa jitna vyapak virodh he, uskaa saboot vidhansabha chunaav main mila, jab bijepi ne baari bahumat se rajasthan jeeta or chhattisgarh tathaa madhya pradesh main teesri baar sarkaar banaai
 The three winning chief ministers acknowledged that Modi's campaign in their states gave an edge
 2014 kii garmiyon main modi pradhanmantri bane yaa na bane, unhone bhartiya raajnneeti kii chaal badal di he
 They often speak, speak loudly and force even those who disagree with them to listen
 29 aktubar ko kanpur kii raily main modi ne kaha tha ki 125 karod kaa desh duniya kii sabase yuva aabaadi ke bal par jo chaahe hasil kar saktaa he
 All that is needed is strong intentions to achieve
 modi itane sayaane hai ki apni kamiyon ko pahachaanate hai or isiilie videsh niti or rashtriya suraksha kii baarikiyon ko samajhane main lage hai
 They are constantly attacking the first family of Congress by mocking Sonia Gandhi and 'shahzada' Rahul
 lekin bahut-se log maanane lage hai ki unhen ab har baar sirf congress par chaabuk bhaanjane kii bajaae samaadhaanon kii baat zyada kerani chahie
 In 2013, anti-congress wave increased Modi's strength
 2014 kii jang modi ke jivan kii sabase mahatvapurn jang hogi

 If the global export scenario is seen in a bad global context, the growth of Indian exports does not look so bad
 UNCTAD dwaara jari vaishvik aankadon ke mutabik bhartiya vastuon ke niryaat main badhat ek saamaanya trend ke tahat ho rahi he, jisase lagata he ki iskaa vaishvik arthvyavastha ke saath gaharaai se judaav he
 India's export growth in dollar terms 8 in FY 2017-18
 8 fisadi kii badhat hai, jabaki vaishvik niryaat main 9
 There was an increase of 8 percent
 pehle kii baat karen to saal 2017 main bhartiya niryaat main 13
 There was a growth of 3 per cent, compared to 10 in global exports that year
 6 fisadi kii badhat hui thi
 Vishwajit Nag, professor at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT), cited the reason for the decline
 unhone kaha ki asal main bharat kaa niryaat zyaadaatar viksit deshon ko hota he
 Now most of the big countries like USA, Japan, China, EU economy are slowing down, due to which their import requirements are decreasing and due to this, Indian exports are not increasing as expected
 vaishvik niryaat main aazaadee ke samay kaa aankada bhi hasil nahin!bharat vaishvik niryaat main apni hissedari ko badhaakar 2 fisadi karne ke aazaadee ke baad vaale daur main bhi nahin le ja paa rahaa
 India's share in global exports in the year 1948
 2 fisadi tak pahunch gaya tha
 Since then, India's share has been consistently below 2 per cent and it stood at 1 between FY 2010 and 2018
 5 se 1
 Has been 7 percent
 duusari taraf, china kaa vaishvik maal niryaat main hissaa saal 2010 ab tak 10
 3 to 13
 8 fisadi ke bich rahaa he
 There has been a considerable increase in exports since the 1980s
 professor naag ke mutabik china ke niryaat main badhat hui he, kyonki usne aisi industry ko khub badhaava diya he jinamein niryaat kii sambhaavna zyada hoti he
 China has laid emphasis on the development of sezs and other related infrastructure such as ports, logistics and single window clearing systems, etc
 iske alaava china ne apane shramikon ko kushal banane ke liye dirghakaalik ranneeti apanaai he, jisase ve vietnam or indonesia jaise sasti mazdooree vaale deshon se muqabla kar sake hai, lekin bharat aisa kuch nahin kar paaya he
 Worrying signs in high value exports Engineering goods, gems and jewelery, readymade garments (clothing) are the top three sectors by value in India's exports
 inkaa desh main mulya ke hisaab se niryaat main sabase zyada yogadan he or shram gahanta vaale kshetra hone kii vajah se inamen badi sankhya main rojgaar bhi miltaa he
 But the RBI figures are disturbing
 ejineering vastuon ke niryaat (jinka kul camodity niryaat main 25 fisadi hissaa hota he) main varsh 2018-19 main sirf 6
 There was an increase of 3 percent, while in the year 2017-18, it had increased by 17 percent
 isi tarah ke aankade ratna-aabhushan or radimaid kapadon ke bhi hai
 Both of these have seen a decline in exports in the last two financial years
 professor naag ke mutabik aayaat laagat bad jane kii vajah se ratna or aabhushan ke niryaat par vipareet asar padaa he
 Apart from this, the global recession has also affected the consumption of such luxury products
 isi tarah, redimaid kapadon ke niryaat main giravat kii kai vajahe hai, jaise-kachche maal ke aayaat par nirbharta, delivery time zyada hona or vietnam, bangladesh, srilanka jaise deshon ke saste shram se mushkil muqabla
 The world is now adopting blending of fabrics such as cotton and synthetic, but India has not yet been ready for this in terms of technology
 bhartiya kaarkaane gharelu khapat par zyada nirbhar hai or niryaat ke liye apni kshamta vikaas par jor nahin de paa rahe
 According to Sanjay Budhia, chairman of the National Committee on Examinations of CII, the cost of raw materials for engineering goods has increased in recent years and steel prices have gone up by 20 per cent in a year
 kya ho aage kaa rastabudhiya ne kaha ki america-china trade war vastav main bharat ke liye ek bada avasar he ki apane niryaat main teji laa sake
 Indian products are of good quality, but they are unable to compete with global competition
 unke mutabik teen vajahon se bharat kaa niryaat peeche ja rahaa he
 First, debt is very expensive for Indian exporters
 bhartiya niryaatkon ko 6 se 7 fisadi kii byaaj dar par karj miltaa he, jabaki china evam vietnam main to byaaj dar lagbhag shunya he
 MSME gets interest subsidy of up to 5 per cent on exports, which needs to be increased for all exporters
 doosraa, steel jaise kachche maal ko usee tarah se pratispardhi keemat par uplabdh karana hoga jaise ki steel companiyaan international byrs ko detii hai
 Thirdly, there is no system of refunding duty, duty on electricity and tax on products like petroleum etc
 to exporters through GST mechanism
 is tarah ke karon se niryaatkon kii jo laagat bad ja rahi he, uski sarkaar ko bharpai kerani chahie
 In addition, according to Professor Nag, effective skill development programs should foster innovation and promote value chain efficiencies for products and processes

 mukhyamantri pad ke liye kamalnath or jyotiraditya sindhiya ke naam kii sabase zyada charchaa thi
 Kamal Nath's name was stamped by Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 indira gandhi kaa teesraa betaa bana siemakamalnath ko aath maheene pehle hi madhya pradesh congress kaa adhyaksh banaaya gaya tha
 When he was made the state president, it again came up in the discussion that former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi considered him his 'third son'
 darasal, ek baar indira gandhi chhindwara loksabhaa seat se lard rahe kamalnath ke liye chunaav prachaar karne ai thim
 Indira then told people at the election rally, 'kamal Nath is like a third son to me
 kripaya unhen vot dijie'saal 1979 main kamalnath ne morarji desai kii sarkaar se muqabla karne main congress kii madad kii thi
 Kamal Nath was Sanjay Gandhi's hostelmate and also went to jail for him in Morarji Desai's government after the Emergency
 39 saal baad 72 saal ke kamalnath ne ab indira gandhi ke pote congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke liye bhi madhya pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main damdaar bhoomika nibhaai he
 Kamal Nath's journey Kamal Nath is counted among the leading politicians of the country
 madhya pradesh ne desh ko jitne bhi nami rajaneta die hai unamem se ek kamalnath bhi hai
 Born on 18 November 1946 in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, Kamal Nath did his schooling from the famous Doon School
 doon skool main unki jaan pahchaan congress ke diggaj netaa rahe sanjay gandhi se hui
 After studying from the Doon School, Kamal Nath earned a b from St
 Xavier's College, Kolkata
 com main snaatak kiya
 On 27 January 1973, Kamal Nath tied the knot with Alka Nath
 kamalnath ke do bete hai
 His elder son Nakulnath is active in politics
 34 saal kii umr main jeeta pehla chunaavkamalnath 9 baar loksabhaa ke liye chune ja chuke hai
 He won elections for the first time from Chhindwara in 1980 at the age of 34 which continues till now
 kamalnath 1985, 1989, 1991 main lagaataar chunaav jite
 From 1991 to 1995 he held the Ministry of Environment in the Narasimha Rao government
 vahiin 1995 se 1996 tak ve kapadaa mantri rahe
 Kamal Nath also won the 1998 and 1999 elections
 lagaataar jeet hasil karne se kamalnath kaa congress main kad badhata gaya or 2001 main unhen mahasachiv banaaya gaya
 He remained the General Secretary of the party till 2004
 chhindwara main to jeet kaa doosraa naam kamalnath ho gaye or 2004 main unhone ek baar phir jeet hasil kii
 This was his 7th consecutive win

 He held this important ministry for the entire 5 years in the UPA-I government
 iske baad 2009 main chunaav hua or ek baar phir congress kaa yah diggaj netaa loksabhaa ke liye chunaa gaya
 This 'lotus' of the Congress continued to bloom in Chhindwara and this time under the Manmohan Singh government, he got the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways
 saal 2012 main kamalnath sansadeey kaarymantri bane
 The important responsibility that was given in Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath is counted among those Congress leaders who are always with the party even in times of crisis
 chaahe wo rajeev gandhi kaa nidhan ho, 1996 se lekar 2004 tak jis sankat se congress guzar rahi thi, is dauraan bhi vah party ke saath rahe wo bhi tab jab sharad pavaar jaise diggaj netaaon ne party kaa saath chhod diya tha
 He became the President of Madhya Pradesh Congress on 26 April 2018
 unhen arun yadav kii jagah adhyaksh banaaya gaya
 How came into politics Kamal Nath was born in Kanpur, studied in Dehradun and West Bengal, but what happened was that Kamal Nath had to do politics from Madhya Pradesh
 darasal desh ke sabase bade raajnneetik parivaar se aane vaale sanjay gandhi kii dosti doon skool main pashchim bengal se aane vaale kamalnath se hui
 The friendship started from Doon School gradually became family
 doon skool se padhai karne ke baad kamalnath kolkata ke saint jevier college pahunche
 Though the city changed, the friendship of the two did not last long
 kamalnath purv piem indira gandhi ke daur se hi gandhi parivaar ke kareebi rahe hai
 Kamal Nath wanted to grow his business
 aise main ek baar phir doon skool ke ye donon dost phir kareeb aa gaye
 It is said that during the Emergency period, when the company of Kamal Nath was running in crisis, Sanjay Gandhi played an important role in removing it from it
 sanjay gandhi kii chhavi ek tej tarraar netaa ke taur par hoti thi
 Kamal Nath lived with this young son of Indira Gandhi all the time
 bade bete rajeev gandhi ko raajnneeti main aane kii ichha nahin thi
 In such a situation, Sanjay Gandhi needed to be together and he was Kamal Nath
 1975 main immergency ke baad se congress kharaab daur se guzar rahi thi
 Sanjay Gandhi had died prematurely during this period, Indira Gandhi's age was also not supporting her now
 congress lagaataar kamjor hoti gai
 Kamal Nath had come close to the Gandhi family, he was also working hard
 vah lagaataar party ke saath khadey hue the
 Indira Gandhi rewarded him when he was given a ticket from Chhindwara seat and cast in politics
 bas phir kya iske baad chhindwara kamalnath kaa ho gaya or kamalnath chhindwara ke
 He has been continuously winning elections from this seat ever since
 sirf ek baar unako is seat par haar mili he
 This area has become the stronghold of Kamal Nath
 vah is seat par tab bhi jite jab 2014 main congress ne ab tak kaa apana sabase kharaab pradarshan kiya
 Chhindwara voters have disappointed Kamal Nath only once when they lost in 1997 to former CM Sundar Lal Patwa
 1996 main kamalnath kii jagah unki patni chunaav ladi thim or jeet mili thi

 yah kadam uthaane se pehle sthiti kaa akalan kiya jaayegaa
 "army is not yet deployed in the city," he said
 vah keval bahari kshetron main he or use bhi do din pehle hi tainaat kiya gaya tha
 Omar admitted that it was the most difficult decision to seek military assistance from the Center
 unhone kaha ki vah apane kaarykaal main is tarah ke nirnay ko phir nahin lenaa chahenge
 Asked when his government would consider withdrawing the army, Omar said it would be possible only after the government was confident of that level
 ghati main hinsa bad jane ke baad mangalvaar raat ko sena bulaayi gayi thi
 He said, "the situation is being monitored on a daily basis
 ham 13 july ke baad us vikalp par vichaar karenge or nirnay karenge
 "on July 13, Martyr's Day is celebrated in memory of those who were killed while fighting against the Dogra regime
" umr ne pad tyaagane kii sambhaavna se inkaar kar diya
 He also dismissed speculation that his father and Union Minister Farooq Abdullah would take over his post
 yah puche jane par ki kya unhone kisi samay hatane ke bare main sochaa tha, ‘kai log chaahate hai ki main hat jaaun lekin main is nirnay ke bare main vichaar nahin kar rahaa
 On the news that his father was interested in coming to the city amidst the current situation and assuming his chief minister, Omar said that there was criticism even when his father was not in Kashmir
 mukhyamantri ne kaha, ‘‘or ab jabaki vah meri maa kii punyatithi par aa rahe hai to mere virdohi atakalein laga rahe hai
 He refused to comment on the suggestion that he and his father should change their responsibilities
 unhone is sawaal par bhi chuppi saadhe rakhi ki kya unhen unki party kaa samarthan hasil he
 Omar painstakingly pointed out that on the first and second day the army was stationed near the airport and was not kept elsewhere
 unhone kaha, ‘‘hamane madad maangi thi lekin ham is baat ko lekar drudh the ki sena kaa pradarshnakariyon se sidhe aamanaa saamana na ho
 So we asked them for the flag march
 vah sthiti ko dekhte hue jaruri tha
 Appealing to the political parties to stop the break-down role, the Chief Minister said that the decision to seek the help of the army was made after extensive discussions with coalition partners, cabinet ministers and officials as part of efforts to prevent the loss of innocent lives
 sena ko bulaane ke nirnay kii aalochanaon ke bare main puche gayi sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha, ‘‘maine hameshaa swasthy aalochana kaa swaagat kiya lekin main aisi aalochana nahin chahta jisamen vibhaajankaree raajnneeti kii bu aati ho
 i do not want trouble on the roads but on Tuesday the situation was tense
 ’’umr ne kaha, ‘‘mere paas police bal or ardhsainik bal he jis par maujuuda amarnath yatra ke kaaran kaaphi boj he
 i also cannot remove the force from the campaign against insurgent activities as it will give the terrorists a chance to enter the valley
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘lihaaja meri sarkaar ne rajya evam kendriya netaaon se vichaar vimarsh ke baad kanoon evam vyavastha kii sthiti barkaraar rakhane ke liye sena kii madad maangane kaa nirnay kiya
 "the Chief Minister said," Only the wearer can know where the shoe is cutting
 ’’ umr ne kaha ki unhone sthiti or sena kii tainaati ke bare main kendriya grih mantri pi chidambaram or raksha mantri e ke antni se vichaar vimarsh kiya tha
 When asked about the Hurriyat leaders holding talks and talking about the death of some innocent people in it, the Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister said, "right now i want peace in the state
" in muddon par baad main vichaar ho saktaa he
 On the opposition pdp's allegation that the state government was unable to deal with the situation, Omar said, "the facts and figures say something else
" ’’unhone kaha, ‘‘us samay pareshaaniyaan or aam nagarikon kii zyada maut hui

 Regarding the pits on the roads, CM Kejriwal said that under his government, the responsibility of PWD is on some roads which have the highest traffic
 kejariwal ne kaha ki unke 50 vidhayak in sadakon kaa 20-25 kilometre tak in sadakon kaa muyna karenge or unke saath ejeeniyar bhi honge
 All the mlas will take photos of these pits and put their photo on the app

 In the assembly elections held in the year 015, the Aam Aadmi Party won 67 out of 70 seats, eliminating BJP and Congress
 jisamen bijepi ko 3 or congress ko ek bhi seat nahin ai thi
 The Aam Aadmi Party government has fulfilled the promise of cutting electricity rates and giving free water as promised
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne phir sabhi saaton siten jeet lee
 Now the preparations for assembly elections are going on in Delhi from once and the rhetoric among the leaders has also started fiercely
 isi kadi main jab arvind kejariwal ne twit kar kaha, 'dilli main kuch sadakon jimmaa dilli sarkaar ke peedbludi ke adheen he or in par har din lakhon vaahan chalate hai
 a campaign is being launched to overcome the problems during the rainy season
 pehali baar itani bade paimaane par sadakon kaa muyna kiya ja rahaa he'
 So an hour later Gautam Gambhir also said, 'it seems that the roads which are under the supervision of PWD department of Delhi Government are not good, please walk safely
 kai gaddhen hai
 We know the reality of Delhi
 lekin khud ko khush rakhen
 
 yah ek acchhee soch he
 
 
 'let me tell you that Gautam Gambhir is currently an MP from East Delhi
 'bin pani sab sun' to aapane suna hi hoga, lekin lagata he is baar dilliwaalon ko purvanchal kaa mahaparv chhath bhi bina pani ke hi maananaa padegaa
 They are saying this because the condition of Chhat Ghats in Delhi is not very special
 chhath puja ke liye jis pavitra jal kii sabase zyaada zarurat padati he, vratiyon ko is saal usee pavitra jal ke liye jaddojahad kerani padegi
 Mahaparva Chhath of Purvanchal is commencing on 24th October with Nahai Khay
 lekin agar dilli sarkaar ke ghaaton main chal rahi taiyaariyon kii baat karen to dilli ke zyaadaatar ghat chhath puja ke mahaparv ke liye taiyaar nazar nahin aate
 The people of Chhath Committee are unhappy with the preparations of the Delhi Government at the Wazirabad Ghat in Delhi
 samiti kii shikaayat he ki yamuna main pani kaa str bhi kaaphi kam he or saaf safai bhi sahi tareeke se nahin kii gai he
 Six vows will face trouble with this
 darasal wazirabad ghat yamuna paar nivaasiyon ke liye ek pramukh ghat he, lekin taiyaariyon ke naam par is ghat main beshak dilli sarkaar ne ghat taiyaar karne kii koshish kii ho, stage or pandal saj rahe hon, lekin jis yamuna nadi main hazaron vratiyon ko chhath puja ke liye surya bhagwaan ko arghya dena he
 The water level in the same Yamuna is less than the knees
 jabaki manyata he ki surya bhagwaan kiarghy detewaqt vrati ko qamar se upar tak pani main duubakar khadey hona hota he
 The problem is not just about the water level but also the problem of water quality
 ghat ke kinare kaai jamaa he, jisase vratiyon ko phisalkar girane kaa bhi khatra he
 According to the people of Chhath Samiti, water was released in Yamuna every year 2-3 days before Chhath Puja
 jisase pani ke bahaav ke saath ghat kii gandagi bah jaati thi or pani kii gunvattta bhi behatar ho jaati thi
 But so far this year, no water has been released in the Yamuna, which concerns the Chhath Committee
 aapako bataa den ki pichhali baar dilli ke andar 268 ghaaton paranth puja kaayojan hua tha jabaki is baar kul 564 ghat par chhath puja kaa aayojan ho rahaa he
 There are a total of 11 hundred ghats in Delhi, of which around two hundred ghats are inside the NGT
 kareeb 50 ghaaton par pakkikaran ke liye tender chal rahaa he
 According to Delhi government's development minister Gopal Rai, in the wake of Chhath festival, he spoke to the Haryana government and said that sufficient water should be released in the Yamuna
 jisase shraddhaluon ko koi pareshaani na ho
 The Sultanpuri Ghat did not even appear at the Sultanpuri Ghat of Paniyandilli
 naa hi yahaan ke ghaaton ke liye sarkaar ne koi vyavastha kii he
 People here are cleaning the ghats themselves
 logon kaa kahana he ki ham khud hi yahaan jhaadu lagaate hai
 We have not received any help from the government yet
 hamane kai baar kaha he ki hamaara ghat bahut chota he yahaan 10 hazaar log aate hai
 In such a situation, there is a lack of space here

 The Dhoot family had a 50 per cent stake in the company and the rest was held by Deepak Kochhar and his family owned by Pacific Capital
 ek saal baad hi janvari 2009 main dhoot ne NRPL ke diarector pad se istipha de diya or apane kareeb 25,000 share deepak kochar ko hastantarit kar die
 In addition, in March 2010, Supreme Energy Private Limited, a company owned by Dhoot, gave a secured loan of Rs 64 crore to NRPL
 lekin phir march 2010 tak supreme energy ne NRPL kaa bahul swaamitv apane haath main le liya or deepak kochar ke paas sirf 5 fisadi swaamitv bachaa
 The game does not end here, about eight months after this, Dhoot transferred his entire stake of Supreme Energy to one of his associates Mahesh Chandra Panglia
 phir iske kareeb do saal baad pangalia ne company kii apni puri hissedari sirf 9 lakh rupee main deepak kochar kii company pinakal energy ko transfar kar di
 To answer these questions, many serious questions arise about the business partnership of Besikhoot and Deepak Kochhar and the loan given by ICICI to a sinking company
 ism maamle main shikaayat karne vaale videokon ke invester arvind gupta ne india today ko bataaya, 'ham yah jaananaa chaahate hai ki deepak kochar or dhoot ne sanyukt udhyam kyon banaaya or dhoot isse baahar kyon hue

 'gupta ke andeh kaa kaaran NRPL ko usee samayvideshi fundka bahutayat main milanaa he, jab ICICI bank ne dhoot kii company ko lone die the
 The bank gave loans of about Rs 4000 crore to Videocon Group between 2010 and 2012 and DH Renewables added 325 crore and 66 crore rupees to NRPL in the same period

 Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot may deny the irregularity, but many questions have not been answered
 videokon ne isiaisiai ko lone ke badale kya guarantee di? bank ne jab lone manjuur kiya to company kaa credit score kya tha? or sabase mahatvapurn sawaal yah he ki kya chanda kochar ne bank board ko apane pati ke saath dhoot ke kaarobaari rishton kii jaankaree di thi?videokon samooh ne ye lone apni paanch sabsidiari companiyon ke khate main ICICI kii canada or euke kii shakhaon se hasil kiye

 sarkaar ne haal main MTNL or BSNL ke vilay kaa liya he nirnayalaparvaahee va nijee kshetra kii pratispardhaa kii vajah se barbaad huin ye companiyandonon companiyaan ghate main chal rahi hai or inhen sarkari package diya jayegine package se inkaa kitna bhala hoga, is par abhi sanshay kaayam haisarkaar ne mahanagar telephone nigam limited (MTNL) or bharat sanchaar nigam limited (BSNL) ke vilay kaa nirnay liya he
 However, this step has been taken at a time when the water has passed above the head
 ho saktaa he ki isse nijee companiyon ko kuch pratispardhaa mil jaae or unhen kol rate yaa package main kami karnaa pade lekin vilay ke baad bani nai sarkari company kitne samay tak tik paaegi? isse donon companiyon or uske karmchaariyon kaa kitna bhala hoga? yah abhi bhavishya ke garbh main he
 Too late, the designers say that this work should have been done much earlier
 donon companiyaan oparational laagat ke morche par kaaphi nuksaan uthaa rahi hai
 The merger of the two companies and the proposed Voluntary Retirement Plan (VRS) package can help curb some of this cost
 lekin yah galakat pratispardhaa ke daur main is company ko phir se mukaable main khadaa karne ke liye kaaphi nahin hoga
 The government announced a revival package with the merger of MTNL and BSNL on Wednesday, with plans to raise Rs 15,000 crore from sovereign bonds
 iske alaava agle chaar saal main inke real estate jaise asset kii bikri or viares se kareeb 38,000 karod rupee bachaae ja sakenge
 BSNL has assets of around Rs 70,746 crore
 kabhi telecom jagat main tha dabadabaakabhi beasenel ek navratna saarvajanik company thi or emtnael kaa bhi do metro shaharon ke telecom seva par ekadhikaar tha
 But now it has lost more than Rs 90,000 crore
 reliance jeeyo or airtel jaise sakasham diggaj nijee khilaadiyon ke saamne sust sarkari company beasenel kahin tik nahin pai
 Now BSNL, with about 1,76,000 employees, proved to be the white elephant and it was difficult for private companies to survive
 beasenel kaa gathan 1 oktober, 2000 ko hua tha or yah metro shaharon ke alaava puure desh main telecom sevaayen or network management sevaayen pradaan kar rahi he
 It is the oldest telecom service provider in the country
 kai jaankaar yah kehete hai ki ek samay aisa tha ki saal 2007-08 main sarkaar beasenel ko kareeb 7 lakh karod rupee kii baari rakam main bechakar telecom kaarobaar se baahar nikal sakati thi, lekin aaj haalat yah he ki beasenel ke liye sarkaar ko raahat package dena pad rahaa he
 Why BSNL and MTNL have had a monopoly in the communications world in the country before this and due to this the mindset of its employees has remained in the same way, whereas in the telecom world, the atmosphere has become fiercely competitive and Jio has So has shook the private sector giants like Airtel, Vodafone, where are these psus going to stand? ipo taalane ke baad agle paanch saal main hi raajnneetik dakhal, samay ke saath badalane kii naakaami, sarkari niskriy tantra kii vajah se ek majboot telecom company kii haalat itani khasta ho gai ki use raahat package maangana pad gaya
 Given the kind of competition in the telecom world, the same company is able to survive whose network is upgraded
 badhiya network kii vajah se jeeyo ne hi baaki companiyon kaaphi graahakon ko hathiyaa liya he
 In the year 2006-07, the total income of BSNL was around Rs 40,000 crore and net profit was Rs 8,000 crore
 2007-08 ke baad se hi company mushkil main aa gai or agle kuch hi varshon main yah ghate main chali gai
 The company incurred a loss of Rs 9,000 crore in FY 2012
 company kii aamadani bhi ghatakar 28,000 karod rupee se kam ho gaya, jo 2006-07 ke mukaable 30 fisadi kam thi
 Not only this, five years ago 23% of the income of BSNL was being given on the salary of the employees, but now it has increased to 48%
 company ko cash kaa ek bada hissaa beasenel ko 3ji or broadband wireles spectrum kii kharid main lagaana padaa
 This is a great example of mismanagement, policy delays and government interference
 beasenel kii bazaar hissedari ghatakar mahaj 11
 It has been reduced to 5 percent and it has reached the fifth position in terms of mobile subscribers
 badhati maang kii vajah se company apni kshamta kaa vistaar nahin kar pai
 It is also alleged that private companies used their political clout to formulate policies which caused heavy losses to BSNL
 isamen sabase pramukh udhaaharan tha 4ji technology kaaphi der se milanaa
 The company's failure to upgrade technology made it difficult to stay profitable and maintain its high ARPU (average Revenue Per User)
 galakat pratispardhaa or free wais main jeeyo ke aane ke saath-saath data kii keemat sasti hone se bharat ke doorsanchaar kshetra main kai choti-choti doorsanchaar companiyon kii dukaane band ho gayi or maujuuda daur main sirf jeeyo, airtel ke saath-saath vilay kar chukin vodaphone or idia rah gai hai
 MTNL was formed on 1 April 1986, when the government came up with the idea of expanding the telecom network in two major metro cities of the country, Delhi and Mumbai, to start new services and gain revenue
 emtnael ne sanyukt udhyam united telecom limited (UTL) ke dwaara nepal main bhi kaarobaar karti he
 Apart from this, the company is also doing business in Mauritius under the name Mahanagar Telephone Mauritius Limited (MTML) with 100 per cent subsidiaries
 1992 tak mumbai or nai dilli main telecom sevaaon main mahanagar telephone nigam limited (MTNL) kaa ekadhikaar tha
 The reasons for mtnl's plight were the same as that of BSNL
 sarkaar ne mauka ganvaaya!jab beasenel or emtnael apane shikhar par thim, tab sarkaar ke paas yah mauka tha ki kuch hissedari bechakar isaki kaarykushalta ko badhaane kii koshish kii jaae, lekin tatkaaleen sarkaar aisa karne main naakaam rahi
 During the last stock market boom of 2007-08, when BSNL was preparing to launch an IPO, its valuation was estimated to be around $ 100 billion (about Rs 7 lakh crore today)
 tab vodaphone ne tatkaaleen diggj company hach essar ko kharida tha or hach essar kaa vailution sirf 21 arab dollar kiya gaya tha, yani beasenel kaa vailuation isse 5 se 6 guna zyada tha
 However, the IPO was postponed due to several reasons
 ab kya he sarkaar kii yojanab sarkaar MTNL or BSNL ke vilay ke saath hi, 4ji sevaaon ke liye spectrum aavanton, karj kaa punargathan, viaras ke dwaara karmchaaree kii laagat kam karne or asset bechakar dhan jutaney jaisi yojana bana rahi he
 The central government cleared their merger on Wednesday to revive Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) and allowed them to raise Rs 1,5000 crore through sovereign bonds
 saath hi, saarvajanik kshetra kii in companiyon ko 2016 ke mulya par 4ji spectrum kaa aavanton kiya jayega
 Financing for the said spectrum will be done by the Government of India by infusing capital worth Rs 20,140 crore in these psus, apart from this, the amount of Rs 3,674 crore will be borne by the Government of India through budgetary resources for this spectrum value
 
 is spectrum aavanton kaa upyog karte hue, beasenel or emtnael 4ji sevaayen uplabdh karaane, bazaar main pratispardhaa karne tathaa apane vishaal network kaa upyog karte hue gramin kshetron sahit desh bhar main hai speed data uplabdh karaane main samarth ho sakenge
 But this plan is just looking good on paper
 lalaphitaashahee, niskriyata or yojanaon ko lagu karne main aakshamata ke puraane itihaas ko dekhte hue sarkaar ke is kadam ko bhi andeh ke saath dekha ja rahaa he ki yah donon companiyon ke punaruddhar main kitna kaamyaab hoga
 What is the option to stop? Nearly five years after the launch of 4G services, the government realized that BSNL and MTNL also needed it
 ab jab desh main 5ji kaa daur aa rahaa he, beasenel or emtianal abhi 4ji bhi nahin apana paae hai
 Therefore, there is doubt about how much competition she will be able to give to private companies
 kai jaankaar to yahaan tak kah rahe hai ki sarkaar is tarah se karmchaariyon ko sammanjanak tareeke se baahar nikalne kaa rasta de rahi he or antat: iskaa zyaadaatar kaamkaaj band kar diya jayega
 Large-scale employees are a major problem for both BSNL and MTNL, as both have more employees
 beasenel main karmchaariyon kii selary kaa hissaa kul aay kaa 75 fisadi tak ho gaya he, jabaki nijee companiyon main yah mahaj 3 se 5 fisadi he
 Once upon a time there used to be 4 lakh employees in BSNL, which is now reduced to just 1
 76 lakh hai
 Many experts believe that the government's exercise to save BSNL and MTNL will prove to be a waste of money
 kai jaankaar isliye in donon companiyon ko band karne kaa samarthan kar rahe hai, jiske liye sarkaar ko bas ek baar kul 1
 Expenditure of Rs 2 lakh crore (for VRS and other things) has to be got rid of
 lekin sarkaar ne agar kuch kadam uthaae hai to iske kintu-parantu kaaphi sochakar kiye gaye honge
 Overall, BSNL-MTNL have become the backbone of the government
 isliye ab dua hi kii ja sakati he ki beasenel or emtnael is coma se baahar aaen

 kabhi maharashtra main baari rajnatik or aarthik rasookh rakhane vaala yah samudaay apane ghatate prabhutv se behad vichlit he
 These rallies and demonstrations of solidarity were the immediate reasons for the rape and murder of a teenage Maratha girl in Kopardi village in Ahmednagar district in July
 is silsile main teen dalit kishoron ko giraftaar bhi kar liya gaya tha lekin pehle se hi visphotak jatigat rishte ke liye yah ghatana chinagaari sabit hui
 Then, on 7 October, an attempted rape in Talegaon, near Nashik, triggered sharp flames
 paanch saal kii ek maratha bacchee ke saath balaatkaar kii koshish ke liye police ne ek kishoravay dalit ladke ko giraftaar kiya
 But in the fire of Maratha resentment, many trucks burnt to dust and the nashik-mumbai highway remained blocked for six hours
 maharashtra main prabhutvshaalee maane jane vaale marathaon kaa ab kahana he ki lambey samay tak mutthibhar pariwaron kii kamyaabi ko samooche samudaay kii kamyaabi ke taur par prachaarit kiya jaataa rahaa
 Two years ago, a committee headed by Congress leader and former Shiv Sena Chief Minister Narayan Rane submitted a report on the problems of Marathas
 rajya kii aabaadi main maratha 34 fisadi hai lekin sarkari karmchaariyon main unki hissedari sirf 15 fisadi he
 Their enrollment in higher education and technical institutions is only 12 per cent, while in Maharashtra, 36 per cent of the farmers who commit suicide are from this community
 rane khud bhi maratha hai
 He says, "I found that Marathas are mostly farmers or laborers working under the Employment Guarantee Scheme
" unki aarthik sthiti dayaneey he
 Maratha students are quite poor and often do not have money to complete their studies
 acchhee padhai na ho paane se unhen acchhee naukari bhi bamushkil hi mil paati he
 The Rane committee recommended that Marathas be given 16 per cent reservation in education and government jobs
 july 2014 main congress-ensipi kii tatkaaleen sarkaar ne is bare main ek aarakshan niti lagu bhi kar di thi lekin usee november main bombai hycourt ne us par roak laga di
 The court said that Maratha is a socially advanced and prestigious community, it does not need reservation
 bijepi ke devendra fadavis ne us samay rajya main mukhyamantri ke rup main satta sanbhali hi thi
 The Maratha reservation issue then became his headache
 court ne apni tippanee ke liye 1990 se 2008 ke bich ai teen aayogon kii report ko aadhaar banaaya tha
 It was said that Marathas cannot be considered backward
 disambar 2014 main fadavis sarkaar ne bhi maratha logon ko aarakshan ke liye ek vidheyak paarit kar diya lekin april 2015 main hycourt ne us par phir se is aadhaar par roak laga di ki rajya sarkaar supreme court dwaara nirdhaarit 50 fisadi aarakshan kii seemaa se zyada aarakshan nahin de sakati
 This decision of the Supreme Court is 1992, which many states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra themselves have refused to accept more than half of the jobs in various reservations
 is maamle main philhal yachikaaon par sunwaayeeyaan chal rahi hai or hycourt ne rajya sarkaar ko aankade jutaney ke liye aakhri mauka diya he
 Many people in the Maratha community also suspect the Chief Minister's intentions
 kuch log to yah bhi aarope lagaate hai ki fadavis brahman hai, lihaaja apni jatigat bhedbhaav vaali maansikta dikhalaa rahe hai
 Rane says that by amending the Constitution, Maharashtra should be allowed to cross the 50 per cent reservation limit
 ve poochhate hai, ''jab tamilnadu main 68 fisadi tak aarakshan ho saktaa he to maharashtra main kyon nahin?'' unke lihaaj se iskaa jawaab rajnatik ichhashakti main nihit he, ''hycourt ne aadesh par isliye roak laga di kyonki sarkaar ne meri samiti ke nishkarshon ko court ke saamne nahin rakhaa
 The government does not really want reservation for the Marathas
 ''haalanki maratha aarakshan samiti kii aguai karne vaale rajya ke ucch shiksha mantri vinod taavade kehete hai ki rane ko iske liye (unki apni) tatkaaleen congress-ensipi sarkaar ko dosha dena chahie, jisane court ke saamne siforeeshon ko nahin rakhaa
 Tawde asserted, "our government is doing its best to prove that the Marathas are socially and economically backward
" '' lekin taavade or rane jaise netaa ab maratha samudaay ke virodh pradarshnon kii takat ke saamne boune sabit ho gaye hai
 The huge crowd attending the rallies is largely followed by no leader
 tamaam badi partiyaan usase jude rahane kii koshish kar rahi hai
 Recently, Shiv Sena chief and editor of party mouthpiece Saamna Uddhav Thackeray apologized for a cartoon printed in the newspaper that mocked these protests
 is tarah maafee maangana pehle kabhi nahin hua or yah maratha kranti morcha ke naam se chal rahe is andolan kii takat kaa bhi sanket detaa he
 Even some of his Maratha leaders of the Shiv Sena had made up their mind to resign in protest
 saamana ke press or daftaron par patharav kii ikkaa-dukka ghatnaayen bhi huin
 Reservations are not just included in the demands of the Maratha movement
 kai log kathith 'utpeeda kanoon' yani anusuchit jati-janajati (utpeeda nirodhak) kanoon, 1989 ko bhi radd karne kii maang kar rahe hai
 It is being said that Dalits and obcs are using this law to implicate Marathas in fake cases
 maratha seva sangh jaise sanghathanon ke sansthaapak purushottam khedekar kaa daawa he ki ''is kanoon ke tahat jin logon ke khilaaf maamle darj kiye gaye hai, unamem 90 fisadi maratha hai
 It has become a tool for revenge
 '' bhandara-gondia se bijepi saansad naanaa patole kehete hai ki unke paas ''kendriya grih mantralay ke aankade hai jo bataate hai ki utpeeda kanoon ke 95 fisadi maamle badaniyati se darj kiye gaye hai
 "if these claims seem a little bizarre, it is only because they have put the basis of the data which states that the Dalit and OBC community constitutes 27 percent of the population, whereas the total FIR registered is only One percent of the people of these communities register
 iske alaava unamem se bhi sirf 40 fisad hi utpeeda kanoon ke tahat darj karai jaati hai
 The proportion of convictions in cases is very low, so the more guilty false claims can be held for it, the more the apathy of the investigators
 kendriya saamaajik nyaay rajyamantri ramdaas athawale samet tamaam dalit netaaon ne is kanoon main kisi sanshodhan ke prastaav kaa kadaa virodh kiya he
 This opposition from the Marathas will also inspire the Dalit and OBC community to unite themselves
 haal hi main nasik main mani-londrig ke aaropon par march se jail main band obisi netaa chagan bhujabal ke chaar lakh samarthakon ne unhen bina jamaanat die jail main band rakhane ke virodh main pradarshan kiya
 It was also a demonstration of the power of Bhujbal's popularity and, according to experts, an indication from the OBC community that they too were ready to defend their interests in response to the Maratha demand
 phir bhi, rajya sarkaar maratha logon kii shikaayatein to sun rahi he
 The Maharashtra government has offered several changes in its procedure after a case has been registered under the Atrocities Act
 is samay, is kanoon ke tahat chhedkhani jaise aparaadhon ke liye aaropee ko jamaanat lene ke liye hycourt janaa hota he
 This process often takes up to two months
 rajya sarkaar chaahati he ki jamaanat par sunwaayee jila court main ho taaki prakriya jald nipat sake or halke str ke aparaadhon ke liye sarkaar kaa suzav he ki ek hafte ke bheetar jamaanat kii karrwai puri ho jaae
 Many within the government believe that reducing the time people spend in jail for the first time under the atrocities law under the Atrocities Act will add some water to Maratha anger
 utpeeda kanoon yaa oonchi jatiyon ke netaaon ke prati jo gussa he, usase vah vitrushna nahin chhip sakati jo maratha logon main apane hi netaaon ke prati he
 This community traditionally controls cooperative sugar mills, rural banks and mandis, thereby holding on to the rural economy of Maharashtra
 yahi is samudaay ke aarthik aatmavishvaas kaa bada aadhaar he
 But the rural economy has been in crisis for the past decade
 sahakaari kshetra dhah rahaa he or kai milen ghate main chal rahi hai
 Rural banks are also unable to compete with private banks opening their branches far and wide
 ek aam shikaayat yah he ki maratha netaaon ne khud kaa khyaal to rakhaa lekin samudaay kii taraf koi dhyaan nahin diya
 In Latur, for instance, when an unprecedented water crisis had arisen in front of the city, it seemed as if the powerful Deshmukh family was interested in providing more water for the common people to run their sugar mills rather than providing adequate drinking water
 Was only in use
 bhoojal kaa jo str pehle hi kam ho rahaa tha, vah usase or neeche chalaa gaya
 Dilip Deshmukh, brother of former Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, argues that sugar mills keep the economy alive here
 "they create an economy worth Rs 1,700 crore in the district in a year
 isse keval udyog-dhandhon ko hi nahin, balki kisaanon ko bhi phayda hota he
 '' Dalit leader and Dr
 bhimrao ambedkar ke pautra purv saansad prakaash ambedkar bhi maratha netaaon ko jimmedaar tehraate hai
 "there is no share in the benefits of power," he says
 lagbhag 169 pariwaron kaa sahakaari kshetra par niyantran rahaa, lihaaja ve to sampann ho gaye jabaki baaki sabhi log sankat se jujhate rahe
 "that's what Prakash Pawar, professor of political science at Kolhapur University says," It is true that the high number of people attending rallies only indicates how his own people disappointed him
 ''maratha diggaj or ensipi ke mukhiya sharad pavaar khud kai shikayaton ke centre main hai
 Farmer suicides were at the peak of a decade when Pawar was the Union Agriculture Minister
 varsh 2004 se 2013 ke bich ausatan har saal rajya main 3,600 kisaanon ne apni jaan de di
 70,000 crores of NCP leader farmers for Rs
 ke karj maaf karne ke liye pavaar kii tarif karte nahin thakte, lekin hakeekat yah he ki sirf badi jot vaale kisaanon ko hi usase phayda hua
 MNS chief Raj Thackeray says, "pawar has answers to everything
" tab bhala us samay unhone koi upyukt kadam kyon nahin uthaaya jab kisaan khud kii jaan le rahe the?''maratha andolan, daliton or obisi par padane vaale uske prabhaav or lambey samay se chali aa rahi brahman-virdohi bhaawanaaon se ek bade jatigat takaraav kii jameen taiyaar ho sakati he
 The obcs are concerned that the government may dent their part to fulfill the Maratha demand
 aabaadi main mahaj teen fisadi hissaa rakhane vaale brahman pehle hi ashankit hai
 Maratha organizations have always been accused of promoting anti-brahmin sentiments
 pichley saal vayovruddh brahman lekhak babasaheb purandare ko rajya ke sarvocch naagarik puraskaar maharashtra bhushan se sammanit kiya gaya
 Maratha organizations opposed this and some even alleged that they were responsible for the book written by American writer James Lane on Shivaji, which was severely disturbed in the state and was eventually banned in the state
 was
 congress netaa or maratha seva sangh ke sansthaapak sadsy sudhir dhone kaa kahana tha, ''purandare ko maharashtra bhushan dena hamaare jakhmon par namak ghisne jaisaa tha
 We are not against Brahmins
 pichley pandrah saal main saat brahmanon ko yah award mil chukaa he
 But we are against giving this award to the wrong man
 '' haalanki khedekar logon ko bhadakaane ke liye jane jate rahe hai
 He argued in his book Shivarayanchaya Badnamichi Kendre (a center defaming Shivaji) that Brahmins are the biggest enemies of non-brahmins
 unhone likhaa tha ki desh tabhi tarakkee kar saktaa he jab saare brahmanon ko khatm kar diya jaae
 Seeing Khedekar's role in the movement, the Brahmins consider themselves very insecure, so much so that in November they have called a separate conference
 fadavis kaa bhavishya is par nirbhar karata he ki ve is andolan se kaise nibatate hai
 That is why they are struggling to recover losses

 If Fadnavis fails to pacify Maratha anger, then Maharashtra may get trapped in a new vortex

 An institute in Surat, taking a tough stand against ragging, suspended six students for a year and punished 28 others

 Earlier this week, about 15 first-year students reported ragging against their superiors to the authorities and this was investigated by the anti-ragging Committee
 to aakhir akhushi or hemraj kaa katl kyon hua? us raat ghar ke andar aisa kya hua ki ek doctor ne apane haath do-do khun se rang liye? wo koun si awaz thi, jise sunate hi doctor talwaar bekaabu ho gaye
 And what was the scene which he lost his senses on seeing
 pesh he 15-16 may 2008 kii us raat kii aakhri chah ghante kii puri kahani
 Aarushi was dead but Hemraj's breath was still going on
 aise main talwaar dampatti ko laga ki agar aarushi kii maut kaa asli jimmedaar hemraj hi zindaa rah gaya, to phir unka sara raaj khul jayega
 So, the decision he made now was deliberate
 gusse main doctor talwaar aarushi or hemraj par waar to kar chuke the
 But when they realize that Aarushi is dead, both of them get nervous for the first time
 ghabrahat kii vajah ye bhi thi ki hemraj ab tak behosh to tha par jinda tha
 And he could tell the whole story to everyone
 lihaaza tab pehali baar doctor talwaar or noopur talwaar ne ye faisla kiya ki ab hemraj ko bhi maar diya jaae taaki koi saboot hi naa bache
 After killing Hemraj, he had also planned to hide his corpse and then take a hideout after getting a chance
 isi yojana ke tahat doctor talwaar or noopur talwaar ne hemraj ko ek chadar main lapeta or phir behosh hemraj ko ghasitate hue seedhi ke raste chat par le gaye
 After being taken to the roof, Doctor Talwar cut the throat of Hemraj with a surgical blade
 iske baad jab unhen uski maut kaa yakeen ho gaya tab unhone chat par hi pade cooler kaa panel hemraj kii laash par daal diya taaki laash kisi ko dikhaai naa de
 After this, the sheet in which the corpse was taken up, came back down with the sheet and weapon
 phir aarushi ke kamare se dabl bed kaa chadar uthaaya or chat kii taala-chaabi lekar waapas upar gaye
 After this, the sheet was hidden in the empty area between the two roofs
 phir chat ke daravaaje par taala lagaaya or waapas aarushi ke kamare main aa gaye
 Now it was the turn to clean Aarushi's room
 par isse pehle doctor talwaar ne murda aarushi kaa galaa usee sargical blade se thik vaise hi kaata jaise hemraj kaa galaa kaata tha
 So that both their wounds look alike
 iske baad bistar par bikhare samaam ko thik kiya
 Layed a new sheet
 cameraa thik karne ke baad doctor noopur talwaar ne aarushi kii laash kii safai kii or uske kapade badale
 During this time both of them also tampered with the internet router
 cameraa saaf karne ke baad ab doctor talwaar ne khun se sane apane or noopur talwaar ke kapade, chadar, sargical blade ikattha kiye or der raat ko hi flats se baahar jaakar use thikaane laga diya
 While washing the golf stick, he hid it in the lanyard in front of Aarushi's room
 sab kuch nipataane ke baad donon ne flats ke main get par andar se taala laga diya
 While the middle iron gate was locked from outside
 taala lagane ke baad donon hemraj ke kamare se hote hue flats ke andar aa gaye
 Now both were waiting for six o'clock in the morning

 Abdul Rahim Qureshi, a spokesman for the board, said that since Islam only provides for the worship of Allah
 aise mensurya namaskara, gita paath or yoga ko lekar muslim samaaj kii apni jaij aapattiyaan hai
 Since Muslim children also study in schools, it is not right to impose these things on all children

 If you also take this care about marriage, then this recent study can change your thinking
 haal hi main ek khoj kii gai he jisamen single logon ke bare kai tarah kii baton ko galat tehra diya he
 There are many things associated with being single, such as stress and not living a meaningful and fulfilling life, being eager to find a partner etc
 kai saalon se single log, logon kii isvichaardhaara ko badalaneki koshish karne main lage hue hai lekin duniya saboot maangani he or science ne is baat ko apni study main pruf kar diya he
 According to this study, the enjoyment of married life is limited to honeymoon only
 swaabhaavik taur se nae shaadishuda jode shaadi se pehle kii tulana main adhik khush hone kaa daawa karte hai lekin jab ek-duusare ke prati achche hone kii baat aati he to log khushi yaa gam ke usee str par pahunch jate hai jahaan ve shaadi se pehle the
 On the other hand, Singles are more friends than married people
 ye saamaajik sambandhon se acchhee tarah jude hote hai or apane mitron, parivaar or sahakarmiyon ke upar kharch bhi karte hai
 Till now the belief was that single people are selfish and they are afraid to take any responsibility
 shodh se pataa chalaa he ki single log samaaj main sarthak yogadan dete hai or ye log aisi gatividhiyon main biji rahete hai jisase bahut saare logon ko laabh pahunchataa he
 Another thinking about single people is spread among people that they are always trying to find the support of the other
 khaskar akeli ladki yaa mahila ke liye to ye baat paryaay banane lagati he
 Perhaps you would not believe that there are actually many people who are single of their own volition
 ji haa, aise logon kii sankhya main vruddhi ho rahi he
 The decision to get married should be based on your skills and personality and not on the idea that being single is better than getting married

 kehete hai ki mahashivaratri main kisi bhi prahar agar bhole baba kii aradhana kii jaae, to maa parvati or bhole tripurari dil kholkar kar bhakton kii kamanaayen puri karte hai
 Worship Shiva with all your heart on Mahashivratri and fulfill all your wishes
 mahashivaratri hinduon kaa ek pramukh tyohaar he
 It is also the biggest festival of worship of Lord Shiva
 phalgun krishna chaturdashi ko mahashivaratri parv manaaya jaataa he
 It is believed that Lord Shankar was descended from Brahma as Rudra at midnight on the same day in the beginning of creation
 pralay kii bela main isi din pradosh ke samay bhagwaan shiv tandav karte hue brahmad ko tisare netra kii jwaala se samaapt kar dete hai, isiilie ise mahashivaratri athwa kaalaratri kaha gaya
 It is believed that Shiva, who makes the immense beauty of all the three worlds and Sheelwati Gauri an ardhangini, is surrounded by demons and vampires
 unka rup bada ajeeb he
 Consumption of masanas on the body, necklace of snakes in the neck, venom in the throat, jagat-tarini holy ganga in jata and the flame of flame in the forehead are his identity
 bail ko vaahan ke rup main sweekaar karne vaale shiv amangal rup hone par bhi bhakton kaa mangal karte hai or shri-sampatti pradaan karte hai
 This day is also a day for achieving great achievement for mere living
 bataaya jaataa he ki jo log is din param siddhidaayak us mahaan swaroop kii upasna karata he, vah param bhaagyashaalee hota he
 Saint Shiromani Goswami Tulsidas ji has spoken about it through the mouth of Maryada Purushottam Lord Rama, 'shivdrohi Mama Das Kahava'
 so nar sapanehu mohi nahin bhava
 'yan who wants to get me by insulting Shiva, he cannot get me even in a dream
 isiilie shravan maas main shiv aradhana ke saath shriramcharitamanas paath kaa bahut mahatv hota he
 The importance of Shiva can be seen in more detail in 'sivasagar'
 shivsagar main bataaya gaya he ki vividh shaktiyaan, vishnu va brahma, jiske kaaran devi or devtaa ke rup main virajman hai, jiske kaaran jagat kaa astitv he, jo yantra hai, mantra hai, aise tantra ke rup main virajman bhagwaan shiv ko namaskara he
 The famous book 'natarajam' of South India presents the entire light of Lord Shiva
 isamen likhaa gaya he ki madhumaas yani caitra maah ke purv arthath phalgun maas kii trayodashi ko prapujit bhagwaan shiv kuch bhi dena shesh nahin rakhte hai
 It states that 'tripathgamini' Ganga, who finds refuge and rest in Jata, Trilok - the trikala of the heavens, hell and mortals, whose past, future and present make trinetra trinitarian
 jinke teenon netron se utsarjit hone vaali teen agni jeev maatr kaa sharir poshan karti hai, jinke trairashik tatwon se jagat ko trirup yani aakaar, prakaar or vikaar praapt hota he, jinka trivigrah trilok ko trividh rup se nasht karata he, aise trived rupi bhagwaan shiv madhumaas purva pradoshpara trayodashi tithi ko prasann hon
 Shiva devotees worship Shiva with great pomp on the day of Kathamhashivratri associated with Mahashivaratri
 bhakt mandiron main jaakar shivlinga par bel-patr aadi chadhaakar pujan karte hai
 Also, people fast and do night awakening
 shivlinga par bel-patr chadhaanaa, upwas tathaa raatri jaagran karnaa ek vishesh karm kii ore ishaara karata he
 It is believed that Shiva was married on this day, so Shiva's procession is taken out at night
 vastav main shivaratri kaa param parv swayan paramatma ke sristi par avatarit hone kii yaad dilaataa he
 Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras, men and women, children, young and old people can all observe this fast
 is vrath ke vidhaan main savere snanadi se nivrutt hokar upwas rakhaa jaataa he
 The true fast on Shivaratri is that we remained close to God by applying Buddhist yoga to Shiva
 upwas kaa arth hi he sameep rahanaa
 The true meaning of Jagran is also to protect yourself from falling asleep in the sleep of Kumbhakaran in the form of ignorance by being influenced by five vices like work, anger etc
 shivaratri ke parv par jaagran kaa vishesh mahatv he
 Legend has it that once Parvati ji asked Lord Shivshankar, 'which is the best and simple fast-worship, from which the beings of the dead land get your grace easily?' In the north, Shiva told Parvati the remedy for 'shivaratri' fast
 chaturdashi tithi ke swami shiv hai
 Therefore, it has been called the supreme auspicious in astrological scriptures
 vaise to shivaratri har maheene main aati he
 But only Falgun Krishna Chaturdashi has been called Maha Shivaratri
 jyotishiya gananaa ke anusaar surya dev bhi is samay tak uttarayan main aa chuke hote hai tathaa ritu parivartan kaa yah samay atyant shubh kaha gaya he
 Shiva means welfare
 shiv sabakaa kalyaan karne vaale hai
 Therefore, by taking simple measures on Mahashivaratri, only the desired happiness is attained
 jyotishiya ganit ke anusaar chaturdashi tithi ko chandramaa apni kshinsth avasthaa main pahunch jate hai, jis kaaran balhin chandramaa sristi ko urja dene main asamarth ho jate hai
 The direct connection of the Moon has been said to the mind
 ab man kamjor hone par bhautik santaap praani ko gher lete hai tathaa vishaad kii sthiti utpann hoti he, jisase kashton kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Moon is adorned on Shiva's forehead
 isliye chandradev kii krupa praapt karne ke liye bhagwaan shiv kaa aashray liya jaataa he
 a legend also tells that Mahashivaratri is the favorite date of Shiva, so often astrologers suggest Shivaratri to worship Shiva and get rid of sufferings
 shiv aadi-anadi he
 There is a link between the destruction and restoration of the universe
 jyotish main shiv ko sukhon kaa aadhaar maan kar mahashivaratri par anek prakaar ke anushthan karne kii mahatta kahi gai he
 How to worship in Mahashivaratri
 
 
 ham aapako bataate hai ki is din shiv kii puja kis tarah se kii jaati he
 First of all, fill water in an earthen pot, put bell pepper, dhatura flowers, rice, etc
 on the Shivling
 haa ek upaay or bataata hum, agar ghar ke aas-paas main shivalay na ho, to shuddh geeli mitti se hi shivlinga banaakar bhi use puja ja saktaa he
 It is believed that the recitation of Shivpuran should be heard on this day
 raatri ko jaagran kar shivpurana kaa paath sunanaa harek vrati kaa dharm mana gaya he
 After this, the fast is concluded by doing havan of barley, sesame, kheer and belpatra in the next morning
 mana jaataa he ki yah din bhagwaan shankar kaa sabase pavitra din he
 This is the penance through which one can purify one's soul
 is vrath ko karne se sab paapon kaa naash ho jaataa he
 Violent tendencies change
 nirih jeevon ke prati aapke man main dayaa bhav upajataa he
 On Mahashivaratri there is a law of day and night worship chaar pahar din main shivalayon main jaakar shivlinga par jalabhishek kar belptr chadhaane se shiv kii anant krupa praapt hoti he
 Also, at four o'clock at night, Vedamantra Samhita, Rudrashta Dhyayi text should be heard from the mouth of Brahmins
 suryoday se pehle hi uttar-purv main pujan-aarti kii taiyaari kar leni chahie
 At sunrise, worship of Mahashiva night is performed with wreaths and praise kirtan
 uske baad din main brahmabhoj bhandara ke dwaara prasad vitaran kar vrath sampann hota he
 According to the scriptures, Shiva is called Mahadev because he is the god, demon, man, serpent, eunuch, gandharva, animal, bird and lord of all the vegetative world
 shiv kaa ek arth kalyankari bhi he
 Worshiping Shiva leads to discipline, coordination and devotion to the entire creation
 isiilie, stuti gaan kahata he- main aapaki anant shakti ko bhala kya samaj saktaa hum
 Therefore, o Shiva, i bow to you in whatever form you are
 shiv or shakti kaa sammilit swaroop hamaari samskruti ke vibhinn ayaamon kaa pradarshak he
 Most of our festivals are dedicated to shiva-parvati
 shiv aughaddani hai or dusron par sahaj krupa karnaa unka sahaj swabhaav he
 The word 'shiva' means 'well-being'
 shiv hi shankar hai
 Shiva's 'shan' means welfare and 'kar' means the doer
 shiv, advait, kalyaan- ye saare shabd ek hi arth ke bodhak hai
 Shiva is Brahma, Brahma is Shiva
 brahma jagat ke janmadi ke kaaran hai
 The description of Mahashivaratri is found in Garuda, Skanda, Agni, Shiva and Padma Puranas
 yadhyapi sarvatra ek hi prakaar kii katha nahin he, parantu sabhi kathaon kii ruparekha lagbhag ek samaan he
 The importance of this festival has been underlined everywhere and it has been told that on this day, fasting and worshiping Shiva with Belpatra should be done
 vrath se kya miltaa he fal
 
 
 Everyone wants them to worship God, keep fast
 saath hi vah bhagwaan se apano ke dukhon ko dur karne kaa bhi vardaan maangata he or jivan main tarakkee kii kaamana karata he
 We tell you what are the results of worshiping Shiva and fasting
 mana jaataa he ki mahashivaratri ke siddh muhoort main shivlinga ko praan pratishthit karwaakar sthapit karne se vyavsaay main vruddhi or naukari main tarakkee milti he
 In the Pradosh period of Shivratri, bathing the crystal shivalinga with pure Ganga water, milk, curd, ghee, honey and sugar and burning incense and lamps and chanting the mantra, all obstacles are eliminated
 beemaari se pareshaan hone par or praanon kii raksha ke liye mahamrityunjay mantra kaa jaap karen
 Remember, chant the Mahamrityunjaya Mantra only with the rosary of Rudraksha
 mantra dikhne main jarur chota dikhaai detaa he, kintu prabhaav main atyant chamatkaari he
 On the day of Shivaratri, install a Mukhi Rudraksha by bathing with Ganga water and showing incense and lamps and laying a clean cloth on the planks
 shiv rup rudraksh ke saamne baith kar sava lakh mantra jap kaa sankalp lekar jaap aarambh karen
 Chanting can continue even after Shivaratri
 mantra is prakaar he- nam: shivaay
 The worship of exterminator Sadashiva from the universe to the universe is possible for the availability of both cosmic and otherworldly fruits
 tamogun kii adhikta din kii tulana main raatri main adhik hone se bhagwaan shiv ne apane ling ke pradurbhaav ke liye madhyaraatri ko sweekaar kiya

 One should visit the pagoda
 koi vishesh kaamana ho to shivaji ko raatri main samaan antar kaal se paanch baar shivarchan or abhishek karnaa chahie
 While chanting any kind of stream, one should chant the Shivpanchakra mantra
 mahashivaratri par kya karen bhojan?bhakt is baat kaa khyaal rakhen ki bhagwaan shankar par chadhaaya gaya naivedhy khaanaa nishiddh he
 It is believed that the one who eats this naiveya suffers from the miseries of hell
 is ksht ke nivaaran ke liye shiv kii murti ke paas shaaligram kii murti kaa rahanaa anivaary he
 If there is a Shaligram near the idol of Shiva, there is no fault of eating Naivedya
 vrath ke vyanjanon main saamaanya namak ke sthaan par sendha namak kaa prayog karte hai or laal mirch kii jagah kaali mirch kaa prayog karte hai
 Some people do not even use peanuts in the fast
 aisi sthiti main aap moongfalee ko saamagree main se hataa sakate hai
 If you want to eat something salty during fast, you can make Singhara or Kuttu flour pakoras
 is vrath main aap aalu singhada, dahi bada bhi kha sakate hai

 There are two types of sago, one large and one common size

 upi sarkaar ne petrol chori pakadaney ke liye pradesh ke sabhi 6,600 petrol panpon par red karne kaa faisla kiya he

 People of the district administration are going everywhere
 petrol panpon par rassi lagaakar unako band kiya ja rahaa he
 They are being investigated, because the government says that all the 6,600 petrol pumps are there, all will be investigated
 yah karrwai isliye shuru kii gai he, kyonki jo shaks chip lagane vaala tha, usne yah kaha he ki upi ke 90 fisadi petrol papon par petrol kii chori hoti he
 Not only this, he says that petrol is being stolen at petrol pumps in Delhi and other areas of the country
 lakhanu main red shuru hui to pehle petrol panpon par hi do mashiinon main chip lagi mili
 So far there have been raids at 15 petrol pumps, in which petrol theft was found in all 15 pumps
 lakhanu ke asiem (dwitiya) deepi mishra ne bataaya ki inke paas chaar mashine hai, jinamein se do main divaais lagi pai gai
 Due to which Ghatauli was done through remote and no such system has been found in the machines
 jin do mashiinon main chip lagi pai gai, unhen sil kar diya gaya he
 The comments upi estf ne pehali red 27 april ko kii thi
 a petrol pump has several petrol dispensing nozzles, some of which have a chip attached, some have not
 lekin milane par puraa pump sil ho rahaa he
 If the chip comes out of most of the petrol pumps in UP and all are sealed, then the state will go to a halt, so now only the machine is getting the chip
 deepi mishra ne bataaya ki yah janata kii suvidha ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kiya gaya he, kyonki jaisi soochna he ki zyaadaatar petrol panpon main divaais lagi hui he to agar ekadam se saare band ho gaye to janata ko bahut badi asuvidha ho sakati he
 So, on Wednesday, red started in every district on all the petrol pumps of UP simultaneously
 jila prashasan ke log har jagah par ja rahe hai
 Petrol pumps are being closed with ropes
 unki jaanch ho rahi he, kyonki sarkaar kaa kahana he ki jitne bhi 6,600 petrol pump hai, sabhi kii jaanch hogi
 This action has been taken because the person who was going to install the chip has said that 90 percent of UP petrol pumps are stolen
 yahi nahin, uskaa kahana he ki dilli or desh ke duusare ilaakon main bhi petrol panpon par petrol kii chori ho rahi he
 When Red started in Lucknow, the first petrol pumps were found to have a chip in two machines
 yahaan ab tak 15 petrol panpon par red hui he, jisamen sabhi 15 panpon main petrol chori pai gai

 jisase ghatatauli remote ke madhyam se kii jaati thi or mashiinon main aisi koi vyavastha nahin pai gai he

 tippaniyan The first raid was done by UP STF on 27 April
 ek petrol pump par kai petrol dispencing nozal hote hai, jinamein se kuch main chip lagi mili he, kuch main nahin
 But the whole pump is sealed when found
 is andeshe se agar upi ke zyaadaatar petrol panpon par chip nikal aae or sabhi sil kar die jaaen to pradesh thapp par jayega, isliye ab sirf us mashin ko sil ja rahaa he, jisamen chip milti he
 DP Mishra said that this has been done keeping in mind the convenience of the public, because as the information is that most of the petrol pumps have devices installed, the public can be very inconvenienced if all of them are completely closed

 Principal of Government College, Mungaoli in Madhya Pradesh district
 el
 Ahirwar was suspended simply because he called regional MP Jyotiraditya Scindia in the college program
 kshetreey saansad ko kshetra ke collejon main jane kaa puraa haq he or collejon ke kaarykram main bataur vishisht yaa mukhya atithi bulaae jane kaa hameshaa se rivaaj rahaa he, lekin pradesh kii bhaajapa sarkaar ko sindhiya kaa college ke kaarykram main janaa pasand nahin he, kyonki vah saansad to hai, lekin congress ke netaa hai
 The order of suspension of Principal Ahirwar, who called the regional MP in the program, clearly stated that 'this action has been taken against them by Congress leaders
 'ahirwar ne guuruuvaar ko kaha, 'sindhiya mahavidhyalay ke chaatro se samvaad karnaa chaahate the
 They are regional mps, they could have been called according to the rules, so called
 unhone mangalvaar ko chaatro se samvaad kiya
 The very next day my order for suspension arrived
 'ahirwar ne aage kaha, 'mujhe jo nilamban aadesh diya gaya he, usamen sindhiya kaa naam nahin liya gaya he, balki 'congress netaaon' ke aane kii baat kahi gai he
 Scindia may have come with some Congressmen, so what could i do? Neither party had flags nor banners during the event
 main to yahaan chal rahi raajnneeti ke ghamaasan kaa shikaar bevajaah ban gaya
 Scindia has condemned the action taken against the principal
 unhone twit kiya, 'mungawali degree college ke dalit praachaarya dow ahirwar ko bina kisi notice yaa thos vajah, sarkaar ne nilambit kar apni dalit virdohi maansikta ujagar kar di
 This is a dictatorial order of an insensitive government, a prejudiced and grossly reprehensible act
 'unhone ek anya twit main likhaa, 'kya ek saansad ko apane sansadeey kshetra ke mahavidhyalay main bulaanaa itnaa bada aparaadh he ki us mahavidhyalay ke praachaarya ko nilambit kar diya jaae?'vahiin vidhansabha main congress ke netaa pratipaksh ajay singh ne praachaarya ke nilamban par kaha ki aaj madhyapradesh shashan-prashasan kaa jo raajnneetikaran bhaajapa kar rahi he, vah pradesh ke itihaas main kabhi nahin hua
 The Chief Minister should immediately cancel the principal's suspension
 netaa pratipaksh ne aarope lagaaya ki bhaajapa or uske mantri raajnneeti main vyaktigat durbhaavna se kaam kar rahe hai
 a shameful example of this is the incident, on the other hand, a program was organized by the bjp's parent organization RSS at the Rajiv Gandhi Technological University and Jawaharlal Nehru Agricultural University in Bhopal

 a senior home ministry official told NDTV that investigations have so far revealed that the Hizbul Mujahideen is behind all these attacks
 jammu-kashmir police kaa kahana he ki abhi tak yah lag rahaa tha ki lashkar islam naam kaa sanghathan in hamalon ke peeche he
 Actually, there is no organization with this name

 On pulling, she noticed that she was connected to something like a wireless set
 vah us wireles set ko ghar le gaya or baad main use police ne jabt kar liya
 The investigation revealed that the device is a "repeater"
 iske jariye hijbul mujahidin ke sargana apane cader se radio frequency ke zariye baat kar rahe the
 An IB officer told NDTV India that many of his colleagues were caught by security forces after talking to mobiles in the last few days
 isliye unhone yah nayaa tarika izaad kiya, lekin jab vah pakadaa gaya to ve baukhala gaye isiilie ye hamale ho rahe hai

 chitthee main likhaa he kii kai karmchaaree retaillers or dukaane dar se band ho gai hai
 Jammu and Kashmir police say that till now it seemed that an organization named Lashkar Islam was behind these attacks
 darasal, is naam kaa koi sanghathan nahin he
 Deliberately, this confusion was being spread, but now it has become clear
 hamane un logon ko jiro down bhi kar liya he
 There are currently around 250 militants active in the valley
 unamem se 30-40 fisadi hijbul ke hai or mana ja rahaa he ki hamalon ke peeche inkaa haath he
 In fact, the whole affair came to light when one of the shaks went to a shop in Sopore to get his recharge done and saw a hanging wire with a mobile tower
 khinchne par dekha ki vah ek wireles set jaisi cheez se judy thi
 He took the wireless set home and was later confiscated by the police
 tafteesh main pataa chalaa ki ye divaais "ripeter" he
 Through this, Hizbul Mujahideen kingpin was talking to his cadre through radio frequency
 ibi ke ek afasar ne enditivi india ko bataaya ki kyonki pichley kuch dinon main mobile se baat karne par unke kai saathi surakshabalon kii giraft main aa gaye the
 So he devised this new method, but when he was caught, he was shocked, hence these attacks are happening

 These operations took place only with the help of successful communications

 The election of Gujarat Legislative Assembly seems to be different from the elections till now
 is baar kaa gujarat vidhansabha chunaav kaa ran mahaj gujarat ke liye nahin ladaa ja rahaa he, balki desh kii siyasat ke liye bhi ek litmus test mana ja rahaa he
 The reputation of Narendra Modi, who has established the 'gujarat model' as an ideal in the country's politics, is at stake here
 yahi vajah he ki narendra modi gujarat main bijepi kii siyaasi bisaat khud bun rahe hai
 Gujarat is the home state of PM Narendra Modi
 modi 13 saal tak gujarat ke satta ke singhaasana par CM ke rup main virajman rahe hai
 This is the reason that the election results will directly test his political stature
 yah chunaav jiesti or notebandi par bhi modi sarkaar kii sabase badi agniparikshaw he
 In such a situation, if Modi wins the BJP for the sixth time in the battle of Gujarat, then he and his government will be strong
 bijepi gujarat kii siyaasi jang fatah karaati he, to narendra modi ko ye 7 bade siyaasi phaayde honge
 Brand Modi will grow in trust Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani is but Narendra Modi is the face of BJP in the political battle of the state assembly
 pichley kuch saalon main gujarat main bijepi ke khilaaf patidaar, dalit sahit kisaan or vyapaaree sadak par utarkar apni naaraazgi jaahir kar chuke hai
 Due to this the BJP was seen on the backfoot and the opposition has come up with these issues
 bijepi narendra modi ke chehre ke sahare hi jeet kii ummid lagaae hue he
 In such a situation, if the results of the state assembly elections are in favor of the BJP, then this will increase the trust of the people towards the brand Modi
 2019 kaa raah aasaan hogigujrat vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon kaa asar 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav par bhi padegaa
 Both the bjp-congress parties are trying to address the 2019 Lok Sabha elections through Gujarat
 aise main narendra modi gujarat main bijepi ko achche margin se fatah karne main kaamyaab ho gaye, to 2019 main unki raah aasaan hogi
 Scatter in opposition will increase: bjp's victory in Gujarat assembly elections will give a shock to the opposition
 gujarat kii haar se congress hi nahin balki bijepi virdohi dalon main hataasha paidaa hogi
 Not only this, the defeat in Gujarat will increase the unity of the opposition parties
 gujarat main congress kii haar se uske kai sahyogi dal saath chhod bhi sakate hai
 With this, where the Congress party is weak, then the BJP camp will be strong
 2018 ke vidhansabha chunaavon par asargujrat vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon kaa prabhaav agle saal hone vaale rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav main padegaa
 Elections are to be held in many important states next year
 inamen madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh, rajasthan, karnataka or odisha jaise rajya shaamil hai
 The BJP will bring the results of the Gujarat assembly election victory to the BJP in these state elections
 BJP main modi-shah kaa varchasv badhegagujrat vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi kii jeet milti he, to party main pradhanmantri narendra modi or amit shah kaa raajnneetik varchasv main ijapha hoga
 Party leaders will refrain from questioning any move in the party against modi-shah
 haalanki maujuuda samay main bhi party par modi-shah kaa dabadabaa kaayam he, lekin gujarat kii jeet or takat degi
 Critics of the Gujarat model have been fiercely questioned by opposition parties on the Gujarat development model
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke bigul bajane se pehle hi congress ne 'vikaas pagal ho gaya' kaa naaraa diya tha, jo sidhe-sidhe hamalaa gujarat ke vikaas model par tha
 Not only this, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is questioning the Gujarat Development Model to surround the BJP
 in sab ke bich gujarat main bijepi jitati he, to gujarat ke vikaas model par sawaal uthaane waalon ke liye karaara jawaab hoga
 Steps towards economic reforms: Gujarat is also considered as an economic state
 notebandi or jiesti jaise kade kadam narendra modi ne uthaae hai
 The traders of Gujarat took to the road and also demonstrated against GST
 iske alaava congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi modi sarkaar ko gherne ke liye jiesti ko mudda bhi banaaya he
 Despite this, if the BJP manages to win Gujarat's political rival Narendra Modi, then the government will take even more stringent steps towards economic reforms

 Speaking to India Today, Chief Minister Lalthanhawla said, 'we always paid attention to development
 mizoram kii prati vyakti aay or sakshartaa dar sabase zyada he, isliye vipaksh ke paas koi mudda nahin he
 There is no anti-incumbency wave in Mizoram
 lekin hakeekat main das saal lagaataar raaj karne vaali congress ko lekar naa sirf janata main naaraazgi he balki carch bhi sarkaar dwaara sharaab se pratibandh hataane ke faisle se naaraaz he
 Leader of the Opposition and former Chief Minister Zoramthanga said, 'the public is desperate for change, the pace of development in Mizoram has come to a halt during the ten years of Congress rule

 Thousands of people have lost their lives due to this
 yadi ham satta main aate hai to sharaab par phir se pratibandh lagaayenge
 In the political battle of two big leaders of Mizoram, the aggressive BJP is working as fuel in the fire
 purvottar ke saat rajyon main se 6 rajyon main jeet kaa paracham laharaa chuki bijepi 'congress mukt purvottar' ke abhiyaan ko satya main tabdeel karne ke liye edi chotii kaa jor lagaae hue he
 The BJP hopes that if a fractured mandate comes in the assembly elections, the party will play a role in balancing the power in the state
 purvottar ke rajyon main bijepi kii jeet main ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaale north east democratic alliance (NEDA) ke sanyojak himant vishwa sharma kaa daawa he ki bijepi itani site jeetegi ki uske bina koi sarkaar nahin ban sakati
 Hindutva vs Christianity However, for a party like BJP that advocates beef ban, this task will be difficult
 joramthanga kaa kahana he ki hindutv or isai dharm kii vichaardhaara ekadam alag he
 That is why the church is also against the BJP
 lihaaja unke ek bhi seat jeetne kii koi ummid nahin he
 Let me tell you that the Church is not angry, so despite being part of the North East Democratic Alliance formed by BJP, Mizo National Front is keeping distance from BJP
 himant vishwa sharma kaa kahana he ki bijepi kii isai virdohi chhavi ab dhwast ho chuki he
 Three of the four Christian-majority states in the Northeast have a BJP government and are at liberty to follow their religion
 akele ladate hue bijepi ne 40 siton par 39 ummidavaar utaare hai
 The party, which is yet to open an account in the state, is seeing itself as a kingmaker
 aise main sawaal uthta he kya bijepi ke armaan puure honge?congress ke mukhyamantri ko ofrabijepi ne apane saare vikalp khole hue hai
 Hemant Vishwa Sharma says that the government of any party cannot be formed without BJP, whether Chief Minister Lalthanwala or Mizo National Front or Zoram People's Movement
 sharma ne aage yah bhi kaha ki yadi mukhyamantri lalthanhavaala vyaktigat str par sarkaar bananaa chahen to kuch bhi sambhav he
 In such a situation, BJP is also looking for an option to bring Congress Chief Minister after the elections
 pehle wicket ke liye jab 101 ran kii saajhedaari ho or puri team 207 par out ho jaae to iske peeche kuch karishmai gendbaazi jarur hogi
 Yes, it was Karisma and it was shown by leg-spinner and current India coach Anil Kumble
 7 farvari 1999 ko dilli ke firozshah kotla maidan par bharat or pakistan ke bich test match main kumble vah karnama kiya tha jo aaj tak duniya main sirf do bowler kar paae hai
 In the match, Kumble set a record by taking all ten wickets of Pakistan's second innings and became the second bowler in the world to do so after England's Jim Laker
 baharhaal, anil kumble ke 10 wicket ke is maamle main pakistan ke do purv tej gendbaajon wasim akram or vakaar younus ke bich than gai he
 According to a newspaper report, Akram said that Waqar intentionally wanted to be run out in order to deprive Kumble of the perfect 10 record
 vakaar ne apni pratikriya main akram kii is baat ko jhooth bataaya he

 Apparently, Kumble had to dismiss either of these two to take ten wickets
 aakhirkaar unke antim shikaar wasim akram bane the
 On 7 February 1999, Kumble held this record in his name
 kumble kii is shandaar gendbaazi ko yaad karte hue virendra sahvaag ne angrezi akhbaar kii ek puraani khabar nikaali or ise apane twitor pej par tag karte hue likhaa tha 'kismat ke aage, sari sajeesh fail

 vakaar kii manshaa kumble ko das wicket lene se dur rakhane kii thi
 According to Wasim Akram, he explained to Waqar that if Kumble had 10 wickets in his luck, he would definitely win
 lekin ve khud (wasim akram) apana wicket kumble ko nahin dene vaale
 However, Akram was later dismissed by Kumble
 sahvaag ke is twit ke baad purv pakistani tej gendbaaj vakaar unuus ne ek twit kar akram kii baat ko galat bataaya he
 After this tweet, Waqar tagged Wasim Akram and wrote, 'this never happened

 On 23 August, Sitharaman announced a financial package aimed at increasing market sentiment and demand and making loans more freely available for it
 It was announced the recapitalization and reopening of the NBFC fund channel which could open new doors for re-lending management and increase the demand for homes for the government
 It also decided to link home loans directly to the repo rate to better extend the benefits of rbi's multiple rate cuts to customers
 Is this enough? The $ 120 billion Indian real estate sector has been running for over a decade The scale is in the middle of a slowdown

 Although the launch of new homes in these cities increased by 21 percent to 1,11,155 units, there was only a 4 percent increase in sales compared to 2018
 isliye, is kshetra ke punaruddhar ke liye kuch kathor kadamon kii aavashyaktaa he
 The budget's emphasis on affordable homes has helped a bit; Of the newly commissioned projects, 85 per cent of the households with less than 60 m of coppet area are estimated to be in the affordable category

 40 km from Hazaribagh before you enter the Karnapura valley, you go through a very beautiful path, but at first glance do not realize the danger hidden behind the beauty of the forests and lush green fields, which in this quiet area Has passed
 
 
 aaj karnpura main 30 se adhik mining or power companiyaan ghusna chaahati hai
 
 
 Apart from Reliance with the state government, companies like Mittal, Jindal, DVC, Abhijeet Group, Essar, Rungta Mines and Nico Jaiswal have signed mous, and the state-owned company intends to take over 8000 acres of land from farmers in the NTPC area
 
 
 lekin yah karnpura ke logon kii takat he ki ve dhai darjan se adhik mining companiyon kaa pratirodh kar rahe hai or koi bhi company ab tak yahaan par zamin nahin le pai he
 
 
 Today, some 260 million tons of coal is pressed into the Karnpura valley, spread over 90,000 acres of land in Hazaribagh and Chatra districts, and every possible effort is being made to capture it
 
 
 lekin isi zamin ke upar lahalhati fasal or ghaney jangalon kii sampada he, jiske bare main na nijee companiyaan baat karnaa chaahati hai, na hi yah sarkaar ko dikhaai de rahaa he
 
 
 Ironically, Jairam Ramesh, the previous environment minister, did not allow mining in the area of north Karnapura due to being a forest area, but the mining and power companies are leaving no stone unturned to enter here
 
 
 badakagaam, aazadnagar, baadam, gondalpura, baboopada or harli jaise gaanvon main ghumkar yahi mahasoos hota he ki yahaan kaa kisaan vidarbha, andhra pradesh yaa malwa kii tarah pareshaan yaa karz main duba nahin he
 
 
 While the obcs and tribals are happy with their farming and forest produce, Dalits feel strong in the society by owning land
 
 
 isiilie karnpura ke tamaam gaanvon main sangathit hokar 1
 More than 5 lakh people have decided not to give land
 
 
 unka kahana he ki kai saalon se yahaan kii bahufasali khetihar zamin kisaanon ko jitna paisa de rahi he, us anupaat main koi bhi company muawza nahin degi
 
 
 But it is not just about displacing or snatching up agricultural land, but also of environment
 
 
 puure desh main aaj 500 million ton koyale kaa utpaadan hota he or rilanyas kaa iraadaa akele is ilaake se hi koi 100 million ton koyala khodne kaa he
 
 
 It should be remembered that this part of Jharkhand is like a lung of India
 
 
 agar is tarah yahaan vikaas kaa bulldozer chalaa, to na jangal bachenge, na yahaan kii jeevandaayini damodar nadi
 
 
 But the people of Karnpura have no James Cameron, who showed their struggle through 3-D animation
 
 
 unhen apana hero apane bich se hi talashna hoga or is bich jab tak star movies par dobaaraa 'avatar' nahin aati, kya hamamen se koi karnpura jayega

 Former Minister in Delhi Government Kapil Mishra has written a blog about Gandhi and Godse, on which questions are now being raised
 ajtak ne jab kapil mishra se is bare main baat kii to unhone kaha jis tarah se mahatma gandhi kii hatya hui, agar us tarah se hatya nahin hui hoti to bahut sari baton par sawaal-jawaab or charchaa ho rahi hoti
 After Gandhi's assassination, fake Gandhi continued to rule with his surname
 kapil mishra ne kaha ki hatya ke kaaran aisi bahut sari baton par bolnaa hi gunaah ho gaya kyonki jab kisi vyakti kii hatya ho jaati he to phir aap uske bare main galat baat nahin karte hai
 Because talking about him becomes a crime
 purv mantri ne mana ki ve khud jab koi kaam shuru karte hai to rajghat par jarur jate hai
 He has this loyalty in his own Gandhi
 asli gandhivadi vah hoga jo khud godse ko padhegaa
 The one who did not read Godse, what would be the real Gandhian? Kapil Mishra said that after independence, India gave money to Pakistan due to Gandhiji's hunger strike, this was not good among many people at that time
 agar gandhi jinda hote to unki pakistan ke prati unke stand jaise tamaam muddon par charchaa hoti, lekin hatya ke chalate yah mudda puri tarah khatm ho gaya
 He further said that i have written 'gandhi is not considered as Father of the Nation' in my blog, because Jinnah was being considered everything in Pakistan and Bapu was also questioned due to the activities of Partition
 aise main donon taraf se baapu se sawaal puche jate magar hatya ke baad yah saare sawaal band ho gaye
 The former minister said that Godse murdered so people do not read his thoughts
 agar godse vichaarak hote to unhen zyada padhaa jaataa
 According to Kapil Mishra, i believe that if there was a fight of ideas, it would have been more powerful
 uske jariye baapu ko bhi katghare main khadaa kiya jaataa
 People of the country would ask, there would be dialogue in democracy, but if the murder took place, all possibilities including questions and answers and dialogue were gone
 jivan ke antim dinon main baapu kii pahchaan pakistan ke prati samarpan kii banane lagi thi
 Bapu's last memory would probably have been the memory of Pakistan rather than non-violence, satyagraha, if Bapu had been alive for 5-10 years, he would have been alive with this memory
 unhone aage kaha ki shaayad godse bhi yah sochate honge ki kaash unhone hinsa kaa rasta apnaane kii jagah vichaaron kii ladaai ladi hoti or baapu bhi sochate honge ki sirf ahimsa se kuch nahin hota
 On Sadhvi Pragya Thakur's statement on Godse, Kapil Mishra said that he completely disagreed with Kamal Haasan's statement of Hindu terrorist
 godse ek hatyare the or ek hatyare ko hatyara bolnaa chahie naa ki hindu aatankwaadi
 There have been people like terrorist Babur, Timur, Hindu has never been a terrorist
 ab vaicharik aatankwaadi ho rahe hai jinamein aap camel hasan kaa naam bhi daal sakate hai
 Kapil Mishra said that the biggest mistake of Godse is that he did not stop the idea and tried to finish the bullet
 iske chalate bahut saare farji gandhivadi aa gaye jiske chalate 70 saal tak desh kaa itihaas kuch or hota
 In the Nestlé controversy, where many states of the country are banning Maggi noodles one after the other, the Food and Drug Administration Department of Rajasthan also collected 185 samples from all over the state to get Maggi tested

 3

 4
 rajya sarkaar kii tathakthith chaalu haalat main 5 lab main se kisi main bhi packaged food kaa pareekshan karne ke liye jaruri upkaran nahin hai
 5
 rajya sarkaar kii kisi lab main khaane kii saamagree main metal content ko parakhane ke liye koi technolji nahin he
 While stating these facts revealed in TV Today's investigation in front of the state health director BR Meena, he said that he had never thought that any such case like Maggi could come up for investigation, so the state labs of international level such tests Not designed for haalanki central health lab ke nideshak naveen maheshwari ne kaha ki unki 8 lab mashinari or menpavar kii dikkaton ke chalate band padi hai or isaki soochna kai jeene pehle rajya sarkaar ke sambandhit vibhaagon ko di ja chuki he

 The Bihar BJP suffered a major setback when the party's Bhishma Pitamah and Mithilanchal's eldest leader Tarakant Jha joined Nitish Kumar
 lekin wo aresas se puraane rishte ko nahin tod sake, naa hi narendra modi ke prati apni deewangi ko chupa sake
 In a press conference held on the occasion of joining JDU, Tarakant Jha said that he is still associated with the ideology of RSS and he had no complaint with Modi's leadership
 unhen sirf susheel modi se shikaayat thi or isiilie unhone jediu kaa daaman thama he
 The entire JDU office was packed to the brim while witnessing this joining, but as soon as Tarakant Jha reiterated his loyalty to the Sangh, all the JDU leaders became uneasy, someone started advising them in their ears and someone hurried to handle the press conference
 Gone
 aanan-fanan main ye press conference khatm hui lekin saaf ho gaya ki jediu ne bhale hi badi machhlee par daanv lagaaya par ain vakt par daanv ulta pad gaya
 Tarakant Jha has been a strong pillar of the BJP since the Jana Sangh and till recently he was the Chairman of Bihar Legislative Council
 susheel modi se unki anban kisi se chhipi nahin thi or ummid kii ja rahi he ki wo phir ekbar jediu ke cote se vidhaan parishad jaaenge
 BJP leader Sushil Modi said that after the departure of Tarakant Jha, now it may be that Nitish ji should be named after Modi, as Tarakantji is not only associated with the Sangh but also considers Modi as his leader
 aise main ummid he ki jald hi nitishji ko manaane main tarakant jha safal honge
 On the other hand, JDU said that Tarakant Jha's statement has been distorted
 jis vichaardhaara se tarakant jha bhaage hai, uske saath wo jude nahin rah sakate

 pehali najar main sunil singh bhartiya janata party ke hi koi netaa lagate hai
 Rudraksh garland and saffron flower in the neck
 baatcheet karne main bhi sunil singh yogi adityanath kaa naam bahut aadar se lete hai
 But the reality is that in many seats, including Gorakhpur, where Yogi Adityanath is campaigning in a helicopter, Sunil Singh is applying full strength to many BJP candidates in the election
 parade ke peeche ho rahaa he bijepi ko haraane kaa khel!sunil singh raajnneeti ke maidan main nae khilaadi hai lekin yogi adityanath se unka rishta 25 saal purana he
 Until recently, Sunil Singh was the state president of Yogi Adityanath's organization Hindu Yuva Vahini and was among the most trusted people of Yogi
 unhen bharosa tha ki gorakhpur ke saansad yogi adityanath unhen seva kaa inaam denge or vidhansabha chunaav main tikat dilava denge
 But when the ticket could not be found, Sunil Singh rebelled in the name of fighting a battle for the honor of Yogi Adityanath
 ab gorakhpur or aasapaas kii 14 siton par hindu yuva vahini ne apane ummidavaar maidan main utaar die hai
 It is not being told that Sunil Singh's people are working behind the scenes to defeat BJP candidates in many seats
 bijepi main lagaataar adityanath kaa apmaan ho rahaabagi rukh ke chalate yogi adityanath ne sunil singh ko hindu yuva vahini ke adhyaksh pad se hataa diya he lekin sunil singh kaa daawa he ki adityanath kaa aashirwad unke saath he
 He says that Adityanath is constantly being insulted in the BJP
 naa to unhen centre main mantri banaaya gaya or naa hi lokapriy netaa hone ke baavjood uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri ke taur par pesh kiya gaya
 Sunil Singh says that Yogi Adityanath was not even placed in the Election Steering Committee and his picture is missing in BJP posters
 yogi nahin jate prachaar karne!agar yogi adityanath kaa bijepi main itnaa hi tiraskaar ho rahaa he to vah bijepi ke star prachaarak kyon bane hue hai? is sawaal ke jawaab main sunil singh kehete hai ki bijepi ke netaaon ne adityanath par shaayad kaala jaadu kar diya he
 To prove that Yogi's blessing is with him, Sunil Singh says that Yogi Adityanath himself is not going to campaign for the places where he has fielded candidates
 yah seat jeetna naak kaa sawaalguru se baghawat kar ke maidan main utarane vaale sunil singh akele shishy nahin hai
 The Gorakhpur Rural Assembly begins immediately next to the Gorakhnath temple, which is headed by Yogi Adityanath
 jaahir he gorakhnath sthaan ke thik bagal main hone kii vajah se yah seat jitvaana yogi adityanath ke liye naak kaa sawaal he
 The sitting MLA from this seat Vijay Bahadur Yadav was also one of his close disciples at one time
 unako tikat dilaane se lekar chunaav jitawane main bhi yogi adityanath kii mahatvapurn bhoomika thi
 But later, Vijay Bahadur Yadav had differences with Yogi Adityanath and now he is contesting from this seat on Samajwadi Party ticket
 "yogi hataa do to takat kuch bhi nahin"vijay bahadur yadav ab bhi yogi adityanath ke khilaaf sidhe-sidhe bolne se bachate hai
 But some go so far as to say so much that if Yogi is removed from the name of Adityanath, then his strength is nothing
 unke kehane kaa matlab yah he ki yogi adityanath gorakhnath mandir ke peethadhishwar hai isiilie log unki izzat karte hai
 Can he win the election by rebelling against Yogi? On this question, Vijay Bahadur Singh says that people want an MLA who is present with them in every sorrow and pain and who can hold them by the arm when needed
 adityanath or unke logon main yah khaasiyat nahin he 
 When asked about leaders like Hindu Yuva Vahini, a cultural institution, Sunil Singh, Adityanath says that the Hindu Yuva Vahini is a cultural institution and no one can contest elections in his name
 kai logon kaa maananaa he ki adityanath khud is baat se naaraaz hai ki bijepi main unhen vah mahatv nahin mil rahaa he jiske vah hakdaar hai
 That is why he truly sympathizes with leaders like Sunil Singh
 9 main 3 seat bijepi ke pasgorakhpur or uske aasapaas ke ilaakon main yogi adityanath kii pahchaan ek kaddavar hinduvaadi netaa ke taur par he
 But it is also true that even if he himself wins the Lok Sabha elections comfortably, he would not have won the BJP candidates in the assembly elections that way
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main bhi gorakhpur kii 9 siton main se bijepi sirf 3 seat jeet pai thi
 How successful the BJP is for the BJP in trying to form a government in Uttar Pradesh, it depends a lot on whether the coin of Yogi Adityanath is run in his area this time

 (input language) narsinghpur colector sibi chakravarti ke fasebuk post se empi ke grahamantri bhupendra singh khaase naaraaz hai
 The reason for this resentment is the post of CB Chakraborty that he wrote on Facebook
 darasal haal hi main sampann hui RSS-BJP kii samanvay samiti kii baithak main afasarshahi par lagaam lagane kii baat hui
 The very next day many IAS were transferred and one of them was Narsinghpur Collector CB Chakraborty
 unhone fasebuk post main likhaa 'agar kathith buddhijiviyon ne bhrashtachar se ghrinaa kii hoti, iees ke prati ghrinaa ke bajaae to ab tak bhrashtachar kam ho chukaa hota'
 From this post, the Home Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Bhupendra Singh, was so angry that he advised CB Chakraborty to leave the collection and take up leadership
 grahamantri ne kaha ki is tarah se bayaanbaji karnaa seva sharton kaa ulanghan he or karrwai kii shrenee main aata he
 If they still have a passion for social service, then they should join politics
 grahamantri ne to baqayda ye tak kah diya ki wo unako bijepi kaa tikat bhi dilaa denge
 Earlier, the people of Narsinghpur, angry with the transfer of CB Chakraborty, took to the road and took out an outrage rally and angered the system

 He urged the Central Government to take this issue seriously and requested the Forest Department to make a forest safari there
 hema ne sansad main kaha ki unke ilaake main log bandaron ke aatank se trast hai
 Earlier there used to be forests, now trees are also few
 is vajah se bhukhe bandar logon ke gharon main khaane kii talash main ghus rahe hai
 Hema Malini said that animals have the right to live as we have the right to live on this earth
 hamen bandaron ko bhi hifaazat se rakhana chahie
 He said that a 'monkey safari' should be made for monkeys in Mathura so that the monkeys could get natural fruits to eat
 hema malini ne kaha ki bandar samosa khaanaa or fruiti pinaa sikh gaye hai, unhen ab fal pasand nahin aa rahe hai, jo acchhee baat nahin he
 After hearing Hema's words, people on Twitter started trolling her fiercely
 trobers kaa kahana he ki desh main pradooshan, bhrashtachar, garibi or kai anya samasyaayein hai, lekin hema ko to bandaron kii padi he
 Not only this, he also made fun of Hema in the name of the film Sholay
 kuch logon ne hema ke naam par kai mims bhi share kiye
 One user said, 'I felt that while talking about monkeys, they would also speak about pollution, corruption and our economy but it did not happen

 Pawar, along with his daughter and MP Supriya Sule, former Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, along with his family members and party general secretary DP Tripathi cleaned a road between cameras in his hometown of Baramati
 pavaar kaa yah kadam pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar ke 'svachh bharat' abhiyaan ke prati unki sweekruti mana ja rahaa he
 However, in an effort to leave a distinct identity of NCP in this campaign, Pawar held a press conference a few days ago
 us sammelan main unhone yah ghoshnaa kii thi ki unke party ke kaaryakarta maharashtra main dengue ke badhate maamalon ko dekhte hue swatchta abhiyaan chalaayenge

 bjp's Himachal unit president Suresh Bhardwaj participated in the challenge of the crucial session election of Panchayat Aaj Tak Himachal Pradesh
 is satr kaa sanchaalan punya prasoon vaajapeyi ne kiya
 Bhardwaj said that the party put forward Prem Kumar Dhumal for the post of Chief Minister
 party ke is elaan se pehle bhi dhumal rajya main party kaa netritv kar rahe the
 Bhardwaj said that Virbhadra Singh's Congress government in Himachal Pradesh could not fulfill the promises during his tenure
 lihaaja, puure rajya main unke khilaaf antiinkambency kaa maahaul he lihaaja rajya main is baar bijepi kii sarkaar bananaa tay he
 Job promise not fulfilled
 Bharadwaj said that the Congress had promised to provide jobs to 10 lakh people in the state, but the figure did not reach one lakh in five years
 iske chalate rajya ke maujuuda chunaavon main berogari bada mudda he
 Bhardwaj said that the general public makes him sit in power on which he trusts
 isi ke chalate rajya main 6 baar congress sarkaar rahane ke baavjood vah kabhi bhi lagaataar do baar chunaav jeetne main naakaamayaab rahe hai
 Where does the candidate come from? Election Funds: In the state, an assembly costs crores of rupees based on the limit of Rs 28 lakh per candidate for election expenses
 lihaaja, kaise rajyon ke chunaavon main itnaa fund aata he? kya ek aam aadmi isiilie chunaav prakriya ke baahar rahata he?ise bhi padhein: panchayat ajtak: himachal chunaav main ladaai bijepi banaam virbhadrasuresh bharadwaj ne kaha ki maujuuda chunaavon main maidan main kudane ke liye paisa ahm kadi he
 Therefore, there is a great need for electoral reforms in the country, so that no person can be a candidate on the basis of money
 haalanki bharadwaj ne kaha ki maujuuda samay main chunaavon main kuch achchhai dekhne ko milti he
 Now paper posters are no longer used in elections
 isse na sirf chunavi kharch par dabaav kam hua he balki kaagaj ke istemaal par bhi roak lagi he or shaharon kii diwaaren bhi saaf rahati he
 Bhardwaj said that politics is also responsible for corruption
 raajnneeti main bada netaa banane ke baad vidhayakon or saansadon par alge chunaav kaa kharch kamaane kaa bhi dabaav dekhne ko miltaa he
 The victims' families have appreciated the efforts made by the government

 com / bfy23qxmvk — Tiger Shroff (@itigershroff) September 3, 2017 It is being said that Tiger is doing a double role in the film
 darasal is videomen tiger dabl role main najar aa rahe hai
 He has also given the caption to the video something that seems to be a matter of double role
 phir video main kaming sun likhaa aata he, to sochane par majaboor hona hi padataa he ki ho na ho ye masalaa baghi-2 se hi judaa he
 By the way, if Tiger does a double role in this film, it will be a double blast for the film and the audience
 is film kii shooting beete maheene shuru ho chuki he
 The film mentor's girlfriend Disha Patanihi is his opposite
 bataaya jaataa he ki film main is role ko karne ke liye shraddha kaaphi utsuk thi
 By the way, she was also associated with Baaghi, so it is obvious to be curious
 haalanki filmmekars ye conform kar chuke hai ki isamen tiger kii jodi disha pataani ke saath hi banegi
 This is good news for those fans and will be icing on the cake for Tiger
 aakhir is bahaane donon ko saath zyada vakt bitaane kaa mauka jo milegaa

 haal hi main unhone baghi-2 ke liye ek dance sikvence bhi shoot kiya he
 Meanwhile, Disha was also hurt
 unhen do hafte tak aaraam karne kii salaah di gai thi
 Due to this, the shoot was also delayed
 lekin ab wo thik ho chuki hai or film kii shooting dobaaraa shuru ho chuki he
 The dance sequence of this film is choreographed by Ahmed Khan
 indian premier lig yani ipel kaa chatha sijan bas khatm hone vaala he
 The final match is on 26 May
 magar indian anderworld lig kaa asli muqabla ab shuru hone ja rahaa he
 d-company and Chhota Rajan, two of the most feared teams in the Hindustani underworld, have now come face-to-face for the sake of Rs 40 thousand crore scattered on a 22-yard pitch
 ipel main maujuuda phixing ke liye donon khud kaa daaman paak-saaf bataate hue ek-duusare ko jimmedaar tehra rahe hai
 Compared to the IPL in the eyes and in the eyes of 40 thousand crores
 jaahir taur par hindustan ke do sabase khooni khoonkhaar gang is rakam par ab tak kaa sabase bada daav khel rahe hai
 On one side, India's Most Wanted is Dawood Ibrahim's d Company, on the other side is the dreadful gang of Chhota Rajan and between them is a 22-yard pitch where every ball is worth crores, and on both ends are the bookies of these two enemies
 rajasthan royles ke star khilaadi shrishanth ke police giraft main aate hi jab phixing kaa sabase bada khulaasa hua to ungali sidhe daaud ibrahim kii di company par uthi
 According to the police investigation, the whole game was made on the instigation of Dawood's brother Anees Ibrahim
 anis or shakeel mil kar hi daaud kii di-company karachi se chalaate hai, lekin ajtak se exclusive baatcheet main chota shakeel ne phixing kaa iljaam apane jaani dushman chota rajan ke par madh diya
 The truth is that this charge of Chhota Shakeel is once again the beginning of gang war, which is taking place on the cricket pitch instead of drugs and real estate
 par chota shakeel kaa yah bayaan jaise hi ajtak par aayaa chota rajan ke giroh main hadakamp much gaya
 Shortly, the answer came from Chhota Rajan that the d Company is blaming the fixing on others to avoid the accusations
 rajan kaa kahana he ki chota shakeel police ko gumraah kar rahaa he
 Chhota Rajan has nothing to do with the fixing, the plot of fixing has been hatched by Dawood's brother Anees Ibrahim
 do jaani dushman jab ek saath ek-duusare ke khilaaf saamne aakar bolen to yah bhi maamuli baat nahin he
 The gesture is clear that this is the new beginning of the gang war
 bas fark ye he hindustan ke do sabase khoonkhaar gang ne gangvaar ke liye pehali baar cricket ke pich ko chunaa he, kyonki us pich par bicha he 40 hajaar karod rupee, jis par donon kii nazren gadi hai
 Actually, the syndicate of Dawood and Rajan have been playing a bloody game of supremacy for years and this bloody game started in 2000
 jab sharad shetty ko dubai main goliyon se bhun diya gaya
 Betting godfather Sharad Shetty was shot to death by Chhota Rajan's shooters at the India Club in Dubai to establish a paragon of cricket betting in South Asia
 sharad shetty ke katl ke baad rajan kii taraf se vinod chembur cricket betting kaa betaj badshaah ban gaya
 But the secret of Chhota Rajan was not written for a long time
 In a few days, d Company retaliated against a small conspiracy in Bangkok and executed a sensational shootout in which Rajan narrowly escaped but his henchmen died
 
 is shootout ke baad rajan ne khaas intervyuu main di company se intekaam lene kaa elaan kiya
 The battle between Rajan and Dawood, which has been under fire for years, has now added ghee to this new fixing fix, the reason is not just gang-wise but also the speculation of 40 thousand crore rupees of cricket

 He said that wearing women's clothes to save his life is not a crime

 The expansion in the Modi cabinet on Tuesday has once again created a stir in MP politics
 bamushkil chaar din pehle hue shivaraj cabinut ke vistaar ke dauraan rajya ke do kaddavar netaaon babulal gaur or sartaaj singh se unki umr kaa hawala dete hue mantri pad se istipha maang liya gaya tha
 But on Tuesday, when the Najma Heptulla and Kalraj Mishra were not discharged in the Modi cabinet, the statements of these two MP leaders went up
 umr kaa hawala dekar maanga tha istifadarasal, 30 june ko bhopal menshivaraj cabinetka vistaar hua tha
 But even before the swearing in, Madhya Pradesh BJP President Nandkumar Singh Chauhan himself had reached the house of Babulal Gaur and Sartaj Singh and had given a decree of resignation
 istife ke peeche alaakaman kii wo niti bataai gai jiske mutabik 75 saal se upar ke umr waalon ko mantri pad nahin diya jayega
 However, bjp's sweat was lost in taking resignation from these two ministers
 aakhirkaar donon ko party ke farmaan ke saamne jhukna hi padaa tha
 But looking at our age leaders in Modi cabinet, the former state minister Sartaj Singh started feeling cheated
 sartaaj singh ko ab party kaa faisla jyaadati lagane laga he
 At the same time, Sartaj made it clear that he would not sit silent on this issue and would ask the party high command whether the decision to remove him was taken from the Center or Madhya Pradesh
 phone par baat karne par sartaaj faisle se kaaphi aahat lage
 He called it a fraud with the party's hardworking worker
 baat yadi babulal gaur kii karen to wo is maamle par zyada kuch bolne se bachate dikhe
 On Tuesday evening, when we spoke to former MP of Babulal Gaur, he refused to react to it, but the way Gaur is meeting Congress leaders at his house these days is a sure sign Gaur is angry with him
 aapako bataa den ki gaur 10 baar vidhansabha kaa chunaav jeet chuke hai or empi ke sabase kaddavar netaaon main se ek maane jate hai
 The Congress took a pinch
 On the expansion of the Modi cabinet, the Madhya Pradesh Congress quipped that why did the Center not adopt the formula that Babulal Gaur and Sartaj Singh were removed from the Shivraj cabinet as they were aged? State Congress spokesperson KK Mishra has alleged that CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan has taken recourse to age to remove the two ministers of the state, but CM Shivraj Singh has given Babulal Gaur and Sartaj Singh a personal frustration and a sense of political insecurity
 That is removed because of aging
 congress ne bujurg netaa kaa kiya sammanbijepi ne bhale hi apane do mantriyon ko umr kaa hawala dekar mantrimandal se nikaal diya ho lekin congress ne mangalvaar ko uske purv vidhayak or varisht netaa hajarilal raghuvanshi ko unke ghar jaakar 87wein janmdin kii badhai di or sammaan kiya
 Producer-director Vishal Bhardwaj says that as a filmmaker, he is in search of creative success, as it stays with the person longer than success
 'makabool' or 'omkara' jaisi filmon ke nirdeshak vishaal ab apni aane vaali film 'dedh ishkia' ke saath vyast hai
 The film is the next version of 2010's Ishqiya
 abhinetri maadhuri dikshit film main nae avatar main najar aaengi
 Based on the small town story, the film also stars Naseeruddin Shah, Arshad Warsi and Huma Qureshi
 film 10 janvari ko cinemagharon main utregi
 Bhardwaj told reporters in a collective interview, "I never see success, i want creative satisfaction
 safalataa aati he or jaati he, lekin rachanaatmak santushti aap ke saath bani rahati he
 It is better that i want him
 box offis kii safalataa kaa mere liye koi arth nahin he
 " vishaal ne 'dedh ishkia' ke liye sahalekhan kiya he or ek baar phir unhone 'ishkia' ke nirdeshak abhishek choube ke saath milakar kaam kiya he
 When asked why he did not direct the film himself? Bhardwaj replied, "I was very attracted to 'maha Kaminey' because i directed the film 'kaminey'"
 maine yah film likhi he, lekin yah abhishek kii film zyada he
 If he refuses, we do not make the next version
 " Tesla is going to start manufacturing its electric vehicle in Shanghai, China
 vahiin desh main modi sarkaar beete ek saal se testla or appal jaisi companiyon ko bharat main manuphaccharing karne kii manjuuri dene par vichaar kar rahi he
 Will we continue to recognize companies that have met the Make in India conditions and multinational companies will continue to set up factories in other countries? Elon Musk, head of Tesla Inc
 and choosing Shanghai City to set up a new factory in the Chinese government But an agreement has been reached
 yah daawa wal streel jarnal ne kiya he
 This will be Tesla's first factory outside the US to manufacture emission-free vehicles for the future
 is sahmati ke liye china sarkaar ne mek in china kii kai sharton ko darkinar karte hue shanghai ke free trade jone main testla kii is ikai ko manjuuri di hogi
 Now this Tesla factory set up in China will not only fulfill China's efforts to make electric cars but will also show how despite a flagship program like Make in India, we are lagging behind in the race to become the manufacturing haw of the world
 lihaaja sawaal he ki aakhir galati kahaan ho rahi he? kyon 2015 main pradhanmantri modi ke saamne bharat main company lagane kii peshkash karne vaali testla ab china main factory lagane ja rahi he? 2015 main yah peshkash karne ke liye ilon musk ne piem modi se mulaakaat kii thi
 Despite this, why did it happen that India fell behind in this race
 ilon musk ke kuch twit ko dekhe to jawaab miltaa he ki bharat ek sust desh he or vah unke saath kaarobaar karne vaali multinational companiyon kii vaastavik zaruraton ko samajhane kii koshish bhi nahin karata
 Also read: Elon Musk's promise, Tesla 'supercharging car' to come to India this year, India wants to run electric cars on its roads
 uski koshish he ki 2030 tak vah desh main electric kaaron ke zyaadaatar vairient ko beche
 Despite this, he made no effort to encourage companies like Tesla to set up factories in the country
 lekin sawaal yah nahin ki china main testla kii factory lagane kaa faisla ho jane ke baad ab bharat main testla kii duusari ikai nahin lag sakati
 But the problem here is that India is adamant on the condition of Make in India that if any foreign company has to produce in India under the Make in India program, it will have to take at least 30% of its parts from India
 lihaaja, abhi jab bharat main electric kaaron kaa na to naamo nishaan he or na hi uske kal purje koi bana rahaa he to mek in india kaarykram chahta he ki desh main aakar electric car banane vaali company pehle ek-tihaai kal-purje banane kii encelliari unit bharat main lagaae or tab jaakar use mek in india ke tahat desh main manuphaccharing karne kii manjuuri mili
 Tesla is not alone troubled by this condition of Apple's iphone factorymake in India stuck in this condition
 thik aisa hi america smartphone company appal ke saath ho rahaa he
 For the past one year Apple is trying to manufacture other products including its smartphone in India
 lekin uske saamne bhi musiibat ek tihaai kal-purjon ko bharat se praapt karne kii he
 Apple believes that its components have developed with the utmost micro technology and are being manufactured at select locations in the world
 lihaaja, bharat main appal ke utpaada banane ke liye appal ke liye jaruri he ki vah apane inhen saplir se kal-purjon ko praapt kare kyonki bharat main aise product ke liye purje taiyaar karne kii kshamta abhi nahin he
 Therefore, Apple and Government of India are currently negotiating on this condition and it is expected that it should not reach any conclusion of the negotiations
 ab china main bhi kisi videshi company ko manuphaccharing karne kii manjuuri dene ke liye behad kade niyam hai
 In some cases, China's rules are so stringent that no multinational companies take the initiative to turn to China
 iske baavjood use appal or testla jaisi companiyon ke pahal par faisla lene main vakt nahin lagata or na hi in companiyon ko kisi tarah kii riyaayat dene main vah deree karti he kyonki vah jaanati he ki kahaan sharton ko thopane se sirf nuksaan hoga or kahaan phayda lene ke liye vah sharton ko hataa sakati he
 The same understanding is not available in India at the moment, and the result is that even after a program like Make in India has been in place for the last three years, the draft of the advantages and disadvantages in the country is not being decided
 team india ke captain viraat kohli cricket ke kisi bhi formet ke liye maidan par jab bhi utarate hai, to koi naa koi record unka intjaar kar rahaa hota he
 In the first Test match against Sri Lanka starting on Wednesday, Kohli can create history by owning some records
 aise main viraat kohli kii ballebaaji par har kisi kii dhyaan hoga
 Kohli can make this record captain Virat Kohli in excellent form
 wo test cricket main ek captain ke taur 101 ran dur he 2500 ran banane se
 Apart from this, Kohli is just 53 runs away from scoring 1000 runs as a captain on foreign soil
 itnaa hi nahin agar kohli pehle test match kii pehali pari main wo 53 yaa 103 bana lete hai, to cricket ke tino formet main unki ballebaaji kaa ausat 50 kaa ho jayega
 Bhuvneshwar and Jadeja can also make records, apart from Virat Kohli, Team India's swing bowlers Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Ravindra Jadeja can also make some records
 bhubaneshwar test cricket main 50 wicket lene se mahaj 5 wicket dur hai
 Apart from this, Ravindra Jadeja needs eight wickets to complete 150 runs in Test cricket
 aswin par bhi hogi najartest match main aswin ne 32
 Has scored 1903 runs at an average of 25
 vah sirf 97 ran peeche hai 2000 ran banane se
 In addition he 2
 88 kii iconmi se 49 test match main 275 wicket jhatak chuke hai
 In such a situation, he can cross the 300 mark with 25 wickets
 haalanki yah kaam thodaa mushkil dikhaai de rahaa he
 But anything can happen watching Sri Lanka's spin friendly wicket
 agar wo aisa karne main kaamyaab rahe to aswin newjiland ke purv mahaan ol rounder richard hadlee ke record ko tod denge
 Hadley completed this feat by playing 54 Test matches

 Pervez Musharraf, who once ruled Pakistan, was confronted in the capital of his own country on Friday when the police arrested him as per the court order and then took him to the police headquarters
 siyasat main apan sikaa jamaane kaa armaan sahejkar kareeb chaar saal ke baad pakistan laute 69 varshiya musharraf ko islamabad ke bahari ilaake main sthit unke aaleeshaan farmahouse se police ne giraftaar kiya
 a day earlier, when the court canceled his anticipatory bail, he escaped from the court premises in a dramatic manner to avoid arrest
 pakistan main 2007 main apatkaal lagane ke maamle ko lekar giraftaar karne ke baad purv raashtrapati musharraf ko shuukravaar ko transit remand kii sharton ko puraa karne ke liye unke farmahouse se police mukhyalay le jaaya gaya
 Musharraf (69) was taken from his farmhouse to the Police Headquarters at Sector F-11 here at 2 pm local time
 adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki yah kadam jaruri tha kyonki ek nyaayik adhikari ne subah giraftaar ke baad musharraf ko transit remand par bheja tha
 According to the laws, transit remand means transferring the accused from one court to another and it is necessary to keep the accused in the police station till they are produced in the court
 police adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki musharraf ke jivan ko khatre ke maddenjar unhen kisi thane main rakhana surakshit nahin he
 The magistrate sent Musharraf on a two-day transit remand and ordered the police to approach the anti-terrorism Court for judicial custody
 islamabad se sabase najadik aatankwaad nirodhi adaalat rawalpindi main he or police shuukravaar ko vahaan sampark nahin kar saki
 Musharraf is believed to be produced in an anti-terrorism court on Saturday
