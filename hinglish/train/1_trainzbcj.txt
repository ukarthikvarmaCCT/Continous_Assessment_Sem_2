 ' The decision to give reservation to people of general category is an easy political decision
 1991 main pi
 V
 narsingh raav ne bhi rajnatik nihitarthon ke saath aisi hi ek yojana kaa prastaav diya tha jise ucchtam nyaayalay ne nahin mana or isiilie aarthik rup se pichde saamaanya varg ke logon ko 10 pratishat aarakshan dene ke bhaajapa ke naveenatam prastaav ko vipaksh ke un netaaon kaa bhi samarthan mila jo aamtaur aakraamak rahete hai
 Some doubts are being raised over the timing of the proposal and its implementation, but no party or its leader will risk stopping efforts to bring the people of the general category under the ambit of reservation
 iske liye samvidhan main sanshodhan karke aarakshan par sarvocch nyaayalay ke nirdhaarit 50 pratishat kii seemaa ko badhaakar 60 pratishat karne kii aavashyaktaa hogi, lekin sarkaar aam chunaav se purv kam se kam yah sandesh to dena hi chaahegi ki vah apane mukhya samarthakon kii behatari ke liye gambhirtha se nitigat rup se kuch karne kii manshaa rakhti he
 Whether or not it is electorally convenient, this amazing proposal to increase reservation has given some energy to the BJP which has seen some faltering in recent times
 haal ke vidhansabha chunaavon main party kii ajeyata kii hawa nikal gai thi, khaskar madhya pradesh or rajasthan main jahaan jeet kaa antar thodaa hi kam rahaa isane sanket diya ki log badlaav kaa mood bhi banane lage hai
 Sources in the BJP enthusiastically termed this proposal of reservation as 'game changing'
 haal ke chunaavon kii haar kii vajah aanshik rup se, ucch jati ke matadaataaon kii naaraazgi ko bataaya gaya jo ki khud ko bhaajapa se isliye chalaa hua mahasoos kar rahaa tha kyonki usne anusuchit jati-janajati adhinium ke tahat tatkaal giraftaar ke praavdhaan ko supreme court se khatm kiye jane ke faisle ko palat diya
 The Act provides for immediate arrest for offenses against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, and the court ordered arrest after investigation
 savarnon kii naaraazgi bhaajapa ko kitni mahangi padi ise is baat se samajha ja saktaa he ki madhya pradesh main 11 siton par nota ke liye pade voton kii sankhya bhaajapa ummidavaaron kii haar ke antar se zyada thi
 It is believed that some of his traditional voters who were angry with BJP registered their anger by voting for NOTA instead of angrily voting for Congress
 un 11 siton ko jitkar bhaajapa madhya pradesh main phir se sarkaar bana sakati thi
 The perceived electoral benefits of the reservation explain why the government is so enthusiastic and active in bringing out the old proposal which previous attempts to implement have failed
 jo prastaav abhi tak kaagaj par darj ek vichaar bhar he use kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh ne 'aitihaasik kadam' bataaya
 He said that many people promised or tried it but we have 'done it'
 lekin sawaal yah he ki kya bhaajapa ne vastav main aisa kar dikhaaya he? iskaa faisla to philhal sambhawatah adaalat main hi hoga
 In 1992, the apex court ruled that poverty alone could not be the only compulsory condition for reservation, with poverty being given the benefit of reservation only if there was 'backwardness' at the social and educational levels
 iske alaava, sarkaar ne is nae prastaavit aarakshan shrenee ke liye 'aarthik rup se kamjor' ko jis rup main paribhaashit kiya he us par logon kii bhauhen tani hai
 According to available data, most Indians (more than 90 percent) earn less than the Rs 8 lakh required to be counted in the 'creamy layer'
 ek anya cat of paanch acre se kam jameen tay kii gai he
 Most of the farmers (more than 85%) will come under its purview
 adhikansh bhartiya shahari yaa gramin 1,000 varg foot se kam ke ghar main rahete hai or sarkaar ne aarakshan ke liye jo prastaav diya he usamen ullekh he ki 1,000 foot se zyada kshetrafal ke ghar main rahane vaale shahari logon aarakshan ke rup main sahaayta kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 This means that a large number of people belonging to the general category will now be eligible for reservation
 aarakshan kaa jo dayera tay kiya gaya he or yadi aap usamen upyukt nahin he to aise samaj sakate hai ki aap vastav main desh ke sheersh paanch pratishat kamai vaale logon main aate hai
 If practically everyone in the country becomes eligible for that reservation, can the government still claim that it is really trying to help the economically weaker Hindus, Christians and Muslims? But if we look at the other side of this, this equation involving everyone will give BJP the most electoral advantage
 koi bhi aisa mahasoos nahin kar saktaa ki vah aarakshan ke laabh se vanchit rah gaya or isse gujarat main hardik patel or unke jaise duusare logon ke haath se mudda nikal jayega jo aise samudaayon ke liye aarakshan kii maang karte hai jo aamtaur par iske paatr nahin honge
 Most critics accept that the toughest challenge to this government proposal is coming from the court
 yah vah jagah he jahaan is tarah ke duusare prastaav dhwast ho gaye hai
 That question stands again: What is reservation and whose help is it? The government is also aware of these facts and how strong its arguments are, it will be known in the court

 Many excellent books have been written on the life of Mahatma Gandhi
 isi kadi main nayaa naam 'gandhi bharat se pehle' kaa jud gaya he
 'before Gandhi India' is a Hindi translation of the book 'gandhi before India' by historian Ramachandra Guha
 english main likhi is kitaab kaa behtareen or saral hindi anuwaad sushant jha ne kiya he
 Read further an excerpt from the book, through which you will be able to know about some unknown friends of Gandhiji
 mahatma gandhi jo sambandh viksit kiye wo nijee to the hi, upyogi bhi the
 He had great affection for his sons, nephews and his Indian and European friends
 lekin unke liye zyada mahatvapurn tha ki ye log unke saamaajik or raajnneetik kaamkaaj main madad karte the
 He used to support his newspaper and his advocacy work
 wo saamudayik kalyaan ke kaam ke liye samarthan jutate the
 When he had the means, he would provide financial help for his public and social activities and he was also ready to go to jail with him
 ye ‘sahaayak’ charitra apane aap main mahatvapurn hastiyaan thim
 These were scholars and dedicated people and through these we know Gandhi's personality and historical character better
 henry polak, thambi naidu, eem kechelia, sonjashlegin or parsi rustamaji ke saath unke rishton ke jariye hi ham gandhi ke raajnneetik abhiyaan kaa sahi moolyankan kar sakate hai
 His experiments with Hermann Kallenbach reveal to us his debate with Tolstoy and his followers and his desire for self-improvement
 rychand bhai, joseph doke or sief andrews ke saath unke vaartalap ke jariye ham yah samaj pate hai ki kis tarahagandhi dharmik bahulata ko lekar apni samajhadaari viksit kii
 Through his friendship and correspondence with Pranjeevan Mehta, we get to understand his big goals for his own motherland
 kasturba, harilal or manilal ke saath unke rishton ke jariye ham us gandhi ko behatar tareeke se samaj pate hai, jisaki paariwarik sambandhon main asafalataa uske saamaajik or aadhyatmiksafalataa ke saath-saath khadi dikhti he
 Opponents also have an important role as is clear, we get to know Gandhi better through his opponents in South Africa
 sankeern soch vaale montford chemani, ahamkaari general smats, east rand ke unmaadi sadsy or nataal ke unmaadi shwet logon ne gandhi kii duniya or duniya ke bare main unki soch ko aakaar diya tha
 It was also contributed by fiery Pathans and jealous editor PS Dyer of Durban
 doston or prashansakon kii hi tarah aalochakon or shatruon ne 1893 main durban main aane vaale ek gambhir or nishkapat vakil ko san 1914 main uske capatoun se bharat lautate vakt tak ek tikshn, chatur or jaagruk chintak andolankaaree main tabdeel kar diya tha
 The two most powerful of his opponents were Alfred Milner, an administrator (pro-counsel) of the empire in South Africa, and the scholar and warrior Yann Christian Smuts
 itihaas ne gandhi ko smats se kahin ooncha or milanar se to kaaphi oonchadarja pradaan kar diya he
 But during Gandhi's days in South Africa, these two were far more important figures than him
 haisiyat kii isi asamanta kii vajah ye donon gandhi kii maamuli maangon ko bhi upeksha or apmaan kii nigaah se dekhte the
 If any of these were a bit soft and cared about the Indian point of view, then who knows what the history of Gandhi would have decided If Milner had agreed to give legal status to the erstwhile rights of Indian businessmen in the Transvaal in 1904, Gandhi would not have had the idea of civil disobedience until his return
 yadi teen saal baad smats ne aciatic act waapas le liya hota or kareeb ek hajaar bharatiyon ke boar yuddh purv kshadhikaron par raji ho jaataa to vatan vaapasi ke baad tak gandhi ko kabhi ye pataa nahin chal paata ki ve apane samarthakon kaa manobal kab tak kaayam rakh sakate hai!saal 1903 main daily telegraph ke johannesburg samvaadadaata ne lord milanar ke pratibandh (usne bharatiyon ke rahane ke liye khaas-khaas 'loketions' tay kar die the) ke bare main kaha ki ‘isse utpann vivaad sirf transwaal tak simit nahin rahegaa, balki yah england or bharat tak fail jayega’
 In 1907, Natal Mercury wrote of General Smuts' insistence that this would have unintended consequences both here and in India
 donon hi bayaan bhavishya ko batalaane vaale the
 If Milner or Smuts had made a pact with Gandhi in the beginning, they would never have had the opportunity to develop the technique of satyagraha, nor believed that it could work even in a large and divided country like India
 is
 is maamle main british samrajyavaadiyon or boar naslavaadiyon ne gandhi ko dakshin africa main or baad main unki mathrubhumi main bhi ek jananetaa ke taur par ubharne kaa bharpoor mauka de diya
 Gandhi was a simple speaker, Gandhi mastered South Africa as a writer and editor
 unki shuruyaat hui thi england main, jahaan unke sahyogiyon ne unhen ek patrikanikaalane kii khuli chhot di thi
 In his early days in Natal, he wrote letters to newspapers and a lot of applications to the government
 san 1903 main unhone apana patr shuru kar diya
 Its purpose was documentary and political
 yah patrika gandhi ke hiton ko aage badhaane ke liye nahin balki nataal or transwaal main bharatiyon ke hiton ke liye nikaali gai thi
 Gandhi wrote several articles for this in Gujarati and English
 wo hafte dar hafte isaki chapai par najar rakhte or iske liye paise jutaney kii mukhya jimmedaari bhi unheen kii thi
 Gandhi's skill as an author and editor was excellent
 lekin jahaan tak bhaashan dene kii baat he to vah ek bahut kharaab nahin to ek sapaat vaktaa jarur the
 His friend and admirer Joseph Doak wrote that 'there were many Indians in Johannesburg who were far better, natural and unaffected than Gandhi as speakers'
 gandhi dhime swar main bolte the or unka bhaashan neeras hota tha
 Dok wrote that he never performed hand gestures or waved his hands while giving a speech and 'seldom waved his fingers'
 lekin iske baavjood bhartiya unhen dhyaan se sunate the kyonki bhale hi bolne kaa tarika neeras ho, unke shabdon main dridhtaa hoti thi
 Gandhi did not produce as many dedicated activists from his articles and speeches as he did with his lifestyle and behavior
 unka sanyam, unka parishram, unka saahas alag-alag prishthbhumi ke logon ko aakarshith karne ke liye kaaphi tha
 Whether they are Muslims or Jews, Christians or Tamils, traders or hawkers and priests or bonded laborers
 alag-alag prishthbhumi ke logon ko prabhavit kar unhone ek naitik or phir raajnneetik samudaay taiyaar kar liya, jiske sadsy unke netritv or disha-nirdeshon ke tahat garibi bharaa jivan jeene or jail jane ke liye saharsha prastut rahete the
 His friends' commitment to Gandhi was truly amazing
 eldblyoo rich ke liye wo hameshaa hi ‘bade sardaar’ the
 Pollock preferred to travel with him in an unknown place for months, away from his wife and children because of his respect for Gandhi
 thambi naidu baar-baar giraftaar dene or gandhi kii jindagi bachaane ke liye apni jindagi ko daanv par lagane main bhi khushi mahasoos karte the
 PK Naidu used to like to meet Gandhi whenever he came out of captivity
 urjavan sonja shlegin sara din gandhi ke daftar main kaam karti thim or iske baad bhi tamil mahilaon kii madad karne or unke patiyon ko jail main khaanaa pahunchane ke liye samay or urja nikaal leti thim or harman kalenbakh kii nishtha to in sabase badhkar thi

 Molesting 17-year-old Munna Das at Dolatlala bus stop, 40 km north of Kolkata, has left two people quite hopeful and hope they will not forget this lesson in their lifetime
 pashchim bengal ke madhyagram kii rahane vaali das ravivaar shaam apane ghar se baraasat sthit karate class ke liye nikali, tabhi cycle savaar do log uske peeche lag gaye
 Meanwhile one held her hand
 is harakat se das jaraa bhi nahin ghabaraai or usne us shaks ko dhakka diya, giri, phir waapas apane kadamon par khadi hokar un donon ko majaa chakhaaya
 Earlier this year, Das received two gold medals in state level competition for karate
 haalanki ve log isse anjaan the or unase ulajhane kii galati kar baithe
 Recalling the incident, Das says, 'I caught the neck of one of them
 jaise hi uskaa dam ghutane laga, maine uske chehre par ek panch jad diya
 Then some kicks hit his throat and thighs, causing him to fall
 is maar se ghabaraakar jab ve bhaagane lage to maine unke peeth par kuch or kik jad die
 Falling again escaped there
 ' tippaniyan Das, who left school after class VIII due to family compulsions, is sad that the people present there did not come forward to help him
 haalanki use ummid he ki usase chhedhkhani karne vaale log jald hi pakade jaaenge
 Das, who has been learning karate for the past one and a half years, will give a test of black belt next month
 kaagazon main unka naam munmun das he, haalanki yah karate girl apana naam munna hi pasand karti hai
 Das, a resident of Madhyamgram in West Bengal, left his home for a karate class in Barasat on Sunday evening, when two people riding a bicycle followed him
 is bich ek ne uskaa haath pakad liya
 Due to this action, the slave did not panic at all and he pushed the man, fell, then stood back on his feet and tasted them both
 isi saal kii shuruyaat main das ko karate ke liye rajyastareey pratiyogita main do gold medal mili the
 However, they were unaware of this and made the mistake of getting involved with them
 ghatana ko yaad karte hue das bataati hai, 'main unamem se ek vyakti kii gardan pakad lee
 As soon as he suffocated, i put a punch on his face
 phir kuch kik uske gale or jaanghon ke paas maare, jisase vah gir pade
 Fearing this attack, when he started running, i landed a few more kicks on his back
 phir se girte- padate vahaan bhaag nikle
 Comments paariwarik majaburiyon kii vajah se aathvin class ke baad skool chhod chuki das ko is baat kaa dukh he ki vahaan maujuud log uski madad ko aage nahin aae
 However, he hopes that those who seduce him will be caught soon

 vankhede stadium main sachin tendulkar kaa antim sambodhan puri tarah bhaawanaaon se otprot rahaa
 In his address, Sachin did not forget to thank any person or organization, including his family, who has been associated with his career in some way or the other
 sachin apane sambodhan ke dauraan khud bhi bhaawanaaon main bahe or khud ko sun rahe logon ko bhi baha diya
 In fact, it was the love of Sachin to the countrymen, which instilled in him feelings
 24 saal or ek din tak antarrashtriya cricket ko har pal jeene vaale is khilaadi kii aage kii jindagi kya hogi, abhi nahin kaha ja saktaa, lekin unki patni anjali ne saaf kar diya ki cricket ke bagaiyr sachin ke jivan kii sambhaavna talashna bemaani he
 According to Anjali, Sachin was born for cricket
 anjali kii yah baat us samay bilkul sahi lagi, jab sachin ne apane sambodhan kii shuruyaat main kaha ki 22 gaj ke bich 24 saal kii unki jindagi aaj khatm ho rahi he, lekin vah un sabhi logon ko aaj ke din yaad karnaa chaahate hai, jinhone kisi na kisi rup main unhen yahaan tak pahunchane main yogadan diya he
 Sachin said, my father was my biggest source of inspiration
 vah mujhe ek acha insaan bananaa chaahate the or maine hameshaa koshish kii ki ek acha insaan bana rahun
 Today i am missing my father
 meri maa ne kabhi nahin janaa ki cricket kya cheez he
 As far as i understand, they must have had enough papad to raise a child like me, but the mother has been with me in every way
 maa ne ek khilaadi hone ke naate mere swasthya or khanpan kaa puraa dhyaan rakhaa
 Thanks mother sachin ne kaha ki unki badi bahan savita ne hi unhen sabase pehla bat gift kiya tha
 He would like to thank his sister, his family, his eldest brothers Nitin and Ajith
 sachin ke mutabik unhone ajit ke saath hi ek cricket khilaadi banane kaa sapana paala tha or isamen ajit ne ahm yogadan diya
 After this, Sachin thanked his wife and children
 aisa karte hue sachin apana bhaawanaaon par kaabo nahin rakh sake or unhen chupaane ke liye pani kaa sahaara liya
 Anjali also could not stop the tears from her eyes
 sachin ne kaha, mere jivan kaa sabase haseen pal us vakt aayaa, jab maine anjali se shaadi kii
 Anjali took the responsibility of family on her shoulders and freed me to roam around the country and the world to play cricket
 main samajhataa hum ki agar anjali nahin hotin, to meraa kariyar aisa nahin hota
 Thank you Anjali
 sachin bole, meraa betaa arjuna 16 or beti sara 14 saal kii he
 Both of them have got very little support from me at this stage of age
 main jab kabhi skool main parents meeting main nahin jaataa yaa phir homework karaane main inaki madad nahin kar paata, to inhone kabhi isaki shikaayat nahin kii
 Thanks Sara and Arjun
 main aaj aapse vaada karata hum ki aane vaale 16 or 14 saal tak main har vakt aapke saath rahoonga
 Sachin then thanked the Mumbai Cricket Association, the Board of Control for Cricket in India, the media (print electronics and photographers), selectors, physios, trainers and all team colleagues
 isi dauraan stadium kii badi screen par rahul dravid, vivies lakshmana or saurav ganguli ko dikhaaya gaya, tab sachin ne kaha ki aaj kii unki team or in teenon ke bagaiyr vah apane kariyar ko is rup main nahin soch sakate the
 Sachin said, Rahul, Sourav and Laxman have been my long-time companions
 aaj anil (kumble) yahaan nahin hai, lekin maine in sabake saath shandaar vakt bitaayaa he
 i want to say that we all got a chance to play for India and we should thank God for this, because God has chosen us for this special work
 sachin kaa itnaa kahana tha ki rahul apni bhaawanaaon ko chupa nahin sake
 He looked quite pale
 ganguli or lakshmana kaa bhi yahi haal tha
 After this, Sachin sat on the shoulder of Virat Kohli with his teammates in the tricolor and circled the field and then walked away from active cricket forever
 yah ek yug ke avsaan kaa samay tha
 An era in which Sachin kept every record as his slave and billions of people around the world as his slaves

 abhi 1 june kii subah china ne apane badhate vaishvik aarthik prabhaav ko or badhaane ke lihaaj se ek bada kadam uthaaya
 He announced direct trade with the Japanese currency yen of his currency, the yuan
 isi din mumbai main bhartiya rigerv bank ne duubate rupye ko thaamne kaa apana aashaheen prayaas jari rakhaa, lekin use maamuli kamyaabi hi mili
 56 of Rupee 31 May
 10 rupye prati dollar ke bhav se girakar 1 june ko 55
 Reached 60 rupees per dollar
 yahaan tak ki china ab yuan ko bharosemand antarrashtriya mudra banane ke apane lakshya ke kareeb pahunch gaya he, lekin ek aarthik mahashakti banane kaa bharat kaa khwab abhi dur kii kaudi hi he
 sino-japanese trade will only be settled in yuan and yen and will not require the US dollar
 is kadam se donon deshon kii mudra ko dollar main badalane kii len-dein kii laagat batch jaaegi
 Earlier, 60 percent of sino-japanese trade was in US dollars of 300 billion dollars annually
 isse donon deshon ke bich vyapaar or nivesh ko bhi badhaava milegaa
 According to China's news agency Xinhua, "a step has been taken to increase the international role of the yuan"
 ''america agency bloomberg ne ise ''china ke apni mudra ke vaishvik istemaal ko badhaane ke prayaas or dollar par nirbharta ko kam karne kii disha main ek or kadam'' bataaya
 China has taken this step at the right time
 euro jone gahare sankat main he or japan pichley do dashakon se tehra hua he, aise main america dollar duniya bhar main vaastavik rup main ekmaatr sweekaarya mudra he
 This is where a choice is made
 bharat ke mukaable china calf behtareen sthiti main he
 The strength of a country's currency is ultimately determined by the strength of its economy
 china duniya kii duusari sabase badi arthvyavastha he jiskaa jidipi 7
 2 lakh crores (trillion) dollars, 1 of India
 7 lakh karod dollar ke mukaable lagbhag chaar guna
 It is also the world's fastest growing economy with a growth rate of around 8 per cent, much faster than India's growth rate of less than 6 per cent
 china kaa chaalu khaataa sarplus main he kyonki vah aayaat se zyada niryaat karata he
 This gives Yuan the strength
 duusari taraf , bharat chaalu khate ke morche par baari ghate kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 This makes the condition of the rupee more fragile
 arthshaastri bibek debaroy bataate hai, ''dollar sirf vyapaar main apane istemaal kii vajah se hi duniya kii bhandar mudra nahin bana hua he, isaki vajah yah bhi he ki log dollar main prachlit vittiya parisampattiyon jaise band evam tregeri bills jaisi pratibhutiyon main nivesh karte hai
 China has not yet opened up its financial markets, thus limiting the yuan only for trading needs
 '' debaroy ko lagata he ki ab se kam se kam 20 saal ke baad hi yuan vaishvik mudra ban paaegaa
 For now, China probably has limited ambitions to make it a regionally acceptable currency
 duusari taraf , rupaya to kshetreey mudra kaa darja hasil karne kii bhi nahin soch saktaa
 Saugata Bhattacharya, chief economist and senior vice president of Axis Bank, says: "I can't imagine that Japan could use anything other than sending the rupee back to India as a help
" ''pichley saal se rupye ke mulya main 20 fisadi kii giravat aa chuki he
 Given this record, no one would want to keep money in their foreign exchange reserves
 debaroy kehete hai, ''rupye ko vaishvik mudra kaa darja hasil karne main kam se kam 40 saal lag sakate hai
 If the UPA government remains in power for a long time, it may take more time
 ''pichley ek saal main rupye main ai giravat sarkaar ke kharaab aarthik prabandhan ko hi pradarshit karti he
 Foreign investors have indicated that they do not currently have confidence in the Indian economy
 rupye ne unka gussa or badha diya he
 In July 2010, the government accepted a logo for the rupee
 tab ise rupye ke antarrashtriyakaran kii disha main pehle kadam ke rup main dekha ja rahaa tha
 The rupee has since fallen 20 per cent to 46
 50 ru
 From about 55
 60 ru
 Per dollar
 saal 2010 main sarkaar ke paas saj-sanvar kar taiyaar khadaa rupaya tha, lekin ab yah kahin jaataa nahin dikh rahaa
 Obviously, there are many benefits of drinking lemonade

 Space means space
 par antariksh he kya? kahaan par he? prithvi yaa dharti se kitni dur
 Whose space is familiar? Why did humans reach space? What do satellites roam in space? Can there be war on occupation of space like the world? If not what is the need to send missiles to space? All these questions today because India has killed a satellite with an anti-satellite missile at an altitude of about 300 km from Earth on March 27
 haalanki jise maar giraaya gaya wo satellite bhi apana hi tha
 So today, in the incident, you are taken to space at 100 km altitude from Earth
 to ab zamin or aasmaan ke baad antariksh main bhi bharat surakshit he
 Now no nefarious satellite will enter the country
 ab antariksh main bhi bharat ne 'sargical strike' kar di he
 All the big countries in the world have protected their countries in space apart from water, land and air
 ab bharat bhi un chuninda mahashaktiyon main shaamil ho gaya he
 Which have ASAT anti-satellite missile system
 bhartiya spes agency diardio ne antariksh main ASAT system kaa safal pareekshan karte hue antariksh main 300 kilometre ghus kar ek live satellite ko maar giraaya he
 However, whatever the name of the nation ahead of this, PM Modi said
 sachai ye he ki wo zyaadaatar logon ke palle nahin padaa
 But the bottom line of the Prime Minister's talk was that now there is no threat to the country even from space
 lihaaza baat aage badhaane se pehle ye samaj lenaa zaruri he ki piem modi jis anti satellite masile kii baat kar rahe hai wo aakhir he kya
 Anti-satellite missiles are used to destroy satellites in space, especially for military purposes
 is takanic ko A-SAT system kehete hai
 It is a missile that can easily target any satellite moving in the air
 ek tarah se ye antariksh main johar dikhaane vaala hathiyaar he
 Till now only such technology was with the US, China and Russia
 lekin ab bharat bhi e-sat missile se las desh ban chukaa he
 A-sat missile can destroy any enemy satellite in a war-like situation
 haalanki abhi tak duniya ke saamne aise halaat nahin bane hai
 When this particular weapon is used
 alag alag deshon ne isamen apni kuwvat dikhaane ke liye apane khud ke satellite ko hi maar giraaya he
 These countries include America, Russia and China before India
 bharat ne bhi is pareekshan ke liye apane hi puraane satellite ko maar giraaya he
 It took Indian scientists only 3 minutes to do this
 jis satellite ko maar giraaya gaya wo lo-arth orbit main thi
 Now the question is arising in your mind that what is this 'low-earth orbit'
 ye aapako bataaenge magar usase pehle ye samaj lijie ki duniya ke alag alag desh alag alag maqasad ke liye antariksh main apane satellite bhejte hai
 Through which mobile, radio and TV signals are sent and received
 ise duusare deshon par nigaraanee ke liye bhi istemaal kiya jaataa he
 These satellites are usually present in the low-earth orbit
 lo-arth orbit yani prithvi kii nichali kaksha
 Think of it as such that it is an area of elevation between 100 km to 2 thousand km from the earth
 or jab yahaan koi satellite sthapit kii jaati he, jo use lo-arth orbit aria kaha jaataa he
 The satellite that India targeted with the missile was about 300 km away from the missile
 sabase dilachasp baat ye he ki ye satellite orbit main gumti hui avasthaa main maari gai
 The initial attempt was made by the US and Russia to achieve such a unique force in space
 kyonki usase pehle zamin se launch hone vaali mixilon ke zarie upgrahon ko nishaanaa banaaya jaataa tha
 But Russia first demonstrated the power to kill the satellite in space
 jiske baad america ne bhi ye karnama kar dikhaaya
 The A-SAT system is actually a two-stage missile
 jiske upar emechavi yani miniechar homing viical laga hota he
 After detachment from the missile, it collides directly with the MHV satellite and destroys it
 saathi hi iskaa doosraa phayda ye hoga ki desh kii taraf aani vaali kisi bhi missile ko bharat pehle hi bhaanp kar use desh kii vaadu seemaa main ghusane se pehle hi maar gira saktaa he
 Overall, the threat of missile attack to India from its neighboring countries
 uskaa bhi tod desh ke vaigyanikon ne nikaal liya he
 So now India has become safe in space too

 isamen kami hoti he to swaabhaavik taur par samasyaayein upajati hai
 So it is important that older people also solve it
 ' He further said, 'it is also the job of the rest of the ideology family (ie RSS) to intervene if the matter is not resolved from inside

 Govindacharya said, 'any organization, especially a party with ideology, is not run only by discipline, but by dialogue and trust
 main itnaa kahuunga ki kisi sanghathan ke acha chalane ke liye jaruri he ki bade chhoton ko sneh den or chote bado kaa aadar karen
 If it is deficient, then problems naturally arise
 isliye jaruri he ki bade log bhi iskaa samaadhaan karen
 ' unhone aage kaha, 'vichaardhaara parivaar (yani aresas) ke baaki logon kaa bhi yah kaam he ki agar baat andar se nahin sulajh paa rahi to ve hastkshep karen

 The strength of this ideology has been teamwork
 ' Also, on the subject of increasing intolerance in the country, he said that there are two aspects of intolerance
 iskaa doosraa pahalu samvedansheeltaa bhi he
 He also criticized the attitude of Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah for his beef eating statement, and said that there will be a lot of damage to the society, whether or not there is any harm to the parties who roast the political loophole on the issue

 Akshay Kumar's film 'toilet' a few weeks ago; a love story was shown to the people of Govindasar village in the border district of Kathua
 ye kadam isliye uthaaya gaya kyonki sarkaar ko vahaan toilet banane kii koshishon main gaanv waalon ke virodh kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa tha
 On Monday 1 October, the government declared the area as 'open Defecation Free (ODF)' area, just like Kathua district

 In 2014, villagers demanded immediate availability of fabricated toilets as the border area faced Pakistani firing and shelling
 ye maang mahilaon or bacchon kii suraksha ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kii gai thi
 Nearly two and a half years after this demand, bio-toilets started appearing in some villages of the area
 gaanv waalon ke liye ye acchhee khabar honi chahie thi lekin jinke liye ye toilet banaae gaye unhone hi virodh karnaa shuru kar diya

 Rakesh Sharma, sarpanch of Chakra village, says- “some toilets have been built
 jahaan bhi ye banaae gaye hai log inkaa istemaal kar rahe hai

 This was revealed by the Central Government in response to a written question in the Lok Sabha on Monday
 bijepi ke saansad aswani kumaar ne poocha tha ki kya sarkaar kashmir se dhara 370 hataane ke prastaav par vichaar kar rahi he
 In his question, Ashwani Kumar, MP from Karnal, Haryana, wanted to know from the government what is the process of removing Article 370 from Kashmir and whether the government is moving in this direction
 is sawaal ke jawaab main grih rajya mantri hansraj ahir ne chota sa ek line kaa jawaab diya
 He said that at present no such proposal is under consideration with the government
 raajnneetik taur par bhartiya janata party hameshaa se kashmir ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene vaali samvidhan kii dhara 370 ko khatm karne kii baat karti rahi he

 Both the PDP and Farooq Abdullah's National Conference in Jammu and Kashmir have been strongly opposed to the proposal to abolish Article 370
 farrukh abdulla ne to is bare main haal main yah bhi kaha tha ki wo jaan de denge lekin kashmir se dhara 370 khatm nahin hone denge
 Answering another question about Kashmir itself, Hansraj Ahir said that the government is doing everything possible to restore peace in Kashmir and end violence by mixing every section of society with the mainstream

 He said that melting of Himalayan glaciers is a matter of grave concern but the environment minister did not agree with the warning given in the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that if these glaciers continue to melt at the current rate, by 2035 or earlier They will be eliminated
 report main kaha gaya he ki himalayan glacier duniya ke kisi bhi anya hisse ke glaciaron ke mukaable teji se pigal rahe hai or yahi haal rahaa to ashanka he ki 2035 tak in glacier kaa namonishaan mit jayega
 Ramesh said that Indian scientists do not agree with this report and only science can answer it

 ' akhbaar main prakashit patr ke anusaar, 'modi kii ore se naitik charitra or raajnneetik nitishastra kii aisi asafalataa bharat ke dharmanirpeksh samvidhan ke saath bemail he
 It is also a constitution that is superior to the various constitutions of the world and is based on a pluralistic principle that speaks of free and full representation for minorities
 ' The letter reads, 'if he is elected Prime Minister, it will be bad for India's future to follow the ideals of inclusion and security for all its people and communities
 ' Chetan Bhatt, who signed the letter and a professor of sociology at the London School of Economics, says, "modi is completely the epitome of a ruthless, dangerous and dictatorial ideology that is exactly what the founding ideas of modern India are of general liberalism, democratic and secular principles
" Is the opposite

 kya aap yojana ayog jaisi baari bharkam sanstha ke vikalp ke bare main koi idia rakhte hai
 That how much money the Center and States should spend together on such schemes? What is the scale of the need of a state, what kind of people should be in it, what is the scale of evaluation of development works? agar aap in sab baton par raay rakhte hai to aap ke liye hi pradhanmantri narendra modi ne mangalvaar subah twit kiya he, yojana ayog kii jagah nai sanstha kii shakl kya ho is par aapaki raay maang rahaa hum
 We want to give a shape to the proposed institution that can fulfill the aspirations of 21st century India and strengthen the participation of the states
 iske liye sarkaar ne www
 mygov
 nic
 Have asked for suggestions on
 jab ham maai gavanarment kii site par gaye to vahaan sanstha kii rup rekha se sambandhit raay dene ke liye kollam nazar nahin aayaa
 It may not have been made, but there you have been asked the name of the new organization, the logo, the logo and the tagline
 pandrah agast ko laal kile kii pracheer se pradhanmantri ne kaha tha ki yojana ayog ab 21veen sadi ke bharat kii zaruuraton ko puraa karne main sakasham nahin he
 It may have contributed well to the needs of its time and has respect for it, but it is no longer needed because the federal structure of India is more important today than it was in the last sixty years
 hamaare sangheey dhaanche ko majboot bananaa he
 Formation of a team of Chief Minister and Prime Minister, this work will now have to be thinking in a new color of Planning Commission
 kabhi-kabhi puraane ghar kii repering main kharchaa zyada hota he, lekin santosh nahin hota
 Then he wants to build a new house
 isliye bahut hi kam samay ke bheetar yojana ayog ke sthaan par ek creative thinking ke saath raashtra ko aage le jane kii disha, public-privet partnership kii disha sansadhano prakritik sansadhano kaa optimum utilizeshan, rajya sarkaron ko taqatvar bananaa, sangheey dhaanche ko taqatvar bananaa, nae sharir nai aatma ke saath ek nae institushan kaa ham nirmaan karenge
 After drawing a thick blueprint, after four days, PM has asked for your opinion about this new organization
 yah koi shikaayat kar saktaa he ki yojana ayog samaapt kiya jaae is par to raay nahin maangi gai, lekin aise log philhal santosh kar sakate hai ki nayaa kya ho is par raay maangi gai he
 Now the question is whether the Planning Commission is not able to fulfill the objectives which the Prime Minister is counting on
 kya ayog centre rajya sambandhon main aadchan tha
 Even before Prime Minister Narendra Modi, many thinkers have been advocating for changes in the Plan Commission from abolition to Planning Commission
 aaj ke da hindu akhbaar main puvar rajyapal gopal gandhi ne ek lekh likhaa he yah dharna sahi nahin he ki yojana ayog kii kalpana jawahar laal nehru ne kii thi
 The Planning Commission's vision is the creation of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and mathematician Meghnad Saha
 1938 ke haripura congress main subhash chandra bose ne apane adhyakshiya bhaashan main kaha ki garibi se ladane ke liye azaad bharat main pehla kaam yah ho ki rashtriya yojana ayog bane
 Experts had said that the Prime Minister wanted to be free from Nehru's legacy
 magar pradhanmantri ne jo zarurat bataai he nai sanstha kaa focus usee par rahanaa chahie
 The federal structure refers to the relationship between the central and state governments
 gopal gandhi ne aage bhi likhaa he ki yojana ayog ne sangheey dhaanche kii aatma ko banaae rakhaa he
 The Planning Commission acts as a bridge between weak and strong states, small and large states, in planning and sharing the center funds
 yah kaam 60 ke dashak tak swatantraaa se to hua, magar ek samay aisa bhi aayaa jab congress sarkaar main isaki swatantraaa nahin rahi
 Amidst all this, on many occasions many people strengthened the Center and State relations by running the Planning Commission better
 nae−nae formule bhi nikaale
 States would be removed from federal sentiment by abolishing the Planning Commission
 ab vah koun si sanstha hogi jo yojanaon kii samiksha karegi aatm aalochana karegi
 It should have been that the Planning Commission should have moved towards its original objectives, but was hanged
 gopal gandhi ne yojana ayog kii swaittata behaal na hone dene ke liye upie sarkaron kii bhi aalochana kii, lekin aaj congress pravaktaa anand sharma ne kaha ki pi chidambaram bhi iske dhaanche main badlaav kii baat karte rahe
 Why did not apply it
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan ne kaha yojana ayog ko samaapt kar dene se desh ko nuksaan hoga
 It would be dangerous to hand over financial matters to the free economy
 ummid he sabhi dashark mukt arthvyavastha kii khoobiyon or khataron se avgat honge hi
 Senior journalist Ashok Malik has written in the Economic Times that Modi's dream will be fulfilled only when the states follow Modi's agenda
 agar rajya bhi fail ho gaye to modi safal nahin honge
 Malik argues in favor of the new institution that Rajiv Gandhi devised an idea to give money directly to the panchayats, which weakened the institution of the Chief Minister
 congress ne kshetreey dalon ko rokane ke liye rajyon ko sirf kendriya bajet kaa das pratishat hi kharch karne kaa adhikaar diya
 non-congress states were persecuted under the pretext of Planning Commission and Ministry of Environment
 mukhyamantriyon ko yojana ayog ke afasaron ke paas janaa padataa thalekchar sunanaa padataa tha
 Now, won't all this happen? panchayaton ko sidhe paise nahin milenge mukhyamantri ko das pratishat se zyada kharch karne ke adhikaar honge
 What will be the consultation process in the new organization? Whether the Chief Minister will not have to meet any officer in the Finance Ministry or a new institution are all questions
 phir nai sanstha kyon na bane yah bhi ek sawaal he
 Many people are writing in favor of the Planning Commission and against the Planning Commission
 aap in lekhon ko dhyaan se padhiye
 Many times it seems that to oppose Modi, that is why there is opposition or to support Modi, that is why it is welcome
 kuch hi lekh hai jo peshewar tareeke se paksh vipaksh main likhe gaye hai
 a senior DRDO official said on Thursday that the brahmos supersonic missile will be inducted into the Air Force by 2012

 Kumaraswamy said that if he fails to do so, he will resign
 haalanki, unhone logon se kaha ki unki party ko purna bahumat nahin mila he, jiskaa matlab he ki matadaataaon ne unhen or unki party ko khaarij kar diya he
 Kumaraswamy said, 'people of the state rejected me and my party
 maine purna bahumat dene kaa aagrah kiya tha
 i also heard the statements of farmer leaders and how much support they gave me
 ’ kumaraswami ne kaha ki netaa ke taur par unki bhi kuch majaburiyaan he
 Despite this, he said that his stance on farm loan waiver is quite clear
 bataa den ki karnataka main haar ke baad sattadhari congress ne tisare number kii party jedies ko samarthan dene ke saath-saath kumaraswami ko mukhyamantri banane kaa faisla kiya tha
 In the elections, BJP has emerged as the largest party with 104 seats, while Congress has won 78 and JDS has won 38 seats
 modi se karenge mulakatkumaraswami somvaar ko dilli main pradhanmantri narendra modi se bhi mulaakaat karenge
 This will be Chief Minister Kumaraswamy's first meeting with PM Modi after assuming power
 mukhyamantri ne bataaya ki hamaari sangheey vyavastha main yah parampara he ki kisi rajya ke naye mukhyamantri pad sanbhaalane ke baad pradhanmantri se milte hai
 After reaching Delhi on Monday morning, Kumaraswamy will visit Rajghat to pay homage at the tomb of Mahatma Gandhi

 In a shocking decision, the government postponed the proposed auction for allocation of radio frequency for 3G wireless phone services with fast internet access
 sarkaar ne chaalu vittiya varsh main hi 3ji spectrum aavanton kii yojana banaai thi or iske jariye bajet main 35,000 karod rupye jutaney kaa praavdhaan kiya tha

 Addressing a press conference in New Delhi, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said that the name of humanity is Hindutva and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is an organization of volunteers
 unhone kaha ki sangh kaa uddeshy hindu samaaj ko sangathit karnaa he
 Bhagwat said that the aim of the Sangh is to create the right environment in society
 bijepi main chal rahe ghamaasan par mohan bhagwat koi tippanee karne se bachate rahe lekin unhone kaha ki yah bijepi kaa andruni maamla he na ki sangh kaa
 On the matter of bringing forth the youth in BJP, he said that the age of the leader in the party should be decided by the party and not the Sangh
 unhone ummid jataai ki bijepi maujuuda sankat se jaldi hi nikal jaaegi
 Political parties should decide their own policy
 He said that the Sangh does not interfere in any party's policy and political parties should decide their own policy
 bijepi ko kya karnaa chahie or kya nahin is par bhagwat ne kaha ki sangh salaah dene kaa kaam nahin karata lekin jarurat pade to sangh iske liye taiyaar he
 On the non-union issue, Bhagwat said that distinguishing someone is not taught in the Sangh
 gauratlab he ki bijepi se nikaale gaye jaswant singh ne aarope lagaaya tha ki chunki vah sangh se jud nahin rahe isliye unke saath aisa vyahaar kiya gaya
 There were no two sections in the Sangh when he was asked that the Sangh had deviated from its old ideology, he said that there is no two streams in the Sangh, there cannot be change through power, power can only be the means
 bhagwat ne yah bhi kaha ki sangh kisi varg vishesh ke liye kaary nahin karata, sabhi varg ke log sangh se judate hai
 He also said that the Sangh also has Muslim activists
 jis jinna ke mudde ne bijepi main ghamaasan machaaya hua he uske bare main bhagwat ne kaha ki itihaas main jinna kii bhoomika saaf he
 He said that after the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP has definitely suffered a setback but the BJP will not collapse
 desh kii duusari sabase badi software company infosis ne kaha ki uske board ne aar sheshasi ko gaiyr-kaaryakari chairman niyukt kiya he
 Seshasayee will replace KV Kamat on this post and he has been appointed with immediate effect
 tippaniyan It is noteworthy that Kamat is stepping down from the position of chairman and independent director of Infosys board
 bharat sarkaar kii ore se unhen bricks bank kaa pehla adhyaksh namankit kiya gaya he
 The company said in a statement that Seshasayee has been an independent director on the board since January 2011 and is also the chairman of the audit committee
 sheshasi is pad par kevi kaamat kii jagah lenge or unki niyukti tatkaal prabhaav se kii gai he
 The comments ullekhneey he ki kaamat infosis board ke chairman va swatantra nideshak pad se hat rahe hai
 He has been named the first Chairman of BRICS Bank on behalf of the Government of India
 company ne ek bayaan main kaha he ki sheshasi janvari 2011 se hi board main swatantra nideshak hai or ve audit samiti ke cheirperson bhi hanium It is noteworthy that Kamat is stepping down from the position of chairman and independent director of Infosys board

 The company said in a statement that Seshasayee has been an independent director on the board since January 2011 and is also the chairman of the audit committee
 company ne ek bayaan main kaha he ki sheshasi janvari 2011 se hi board main swatantra nideshak hai or ve audit samiti ke cheirperson bhi hanium Party spokesperson MJ Akbar said that Jaitley's name is not even in the file of Kejriwal who targeted Jaitley for the CBI raid on the pretext of DDCA file
 akbar ne kaha, jetali par kisi bhi kism kii ungali uthaaenge to bahut badi galati hogi, kyonki sachai unke saath he
 Those who are accusing them, they are either misleading or lying
 unhone kaha, sachai saamne aa gai he
 Jaitley is not named in the report
 unke khilaaf koi aarope nahin he, koi sanket nahin he (galat karne kaa)
 The Chief Minister of Delhi should apologize to Jaitley for his allegations
 
 
 unhen saarvajanik taur par maafee maangani chahie
 He said at a press conference, he (kejriwal) must admit his mistake in the court (where Jaitley has filed a defamation suit against the Chief Minister and other AAP members)
 unhone daawa kiya ki tatkaaleen congress sarkaar ke 'shadyantra' ke baad gambhir dhokhadhadi jaanch karyaalay ne jaanch kii thi or jetali ke khilaaf kuch nahin paaya tha, jo didisie ke purv pramukh bhi hai, jabaki tab 'congress kii sarkaar thi
 ' unhone kaha ki kejariwal ne apane samvaadadaata sammelan main jetali par yah aarope lagaate hue hamalaa kiya tha ki sibiai ne didisie file ke liye chhapemari kii thi
 Akbar said, now the Chief Minister got himself trapped
 
 
 unki apni team ne jetali ke khilaaf aarope nahin paaya he
 The BJP spokesperson said that after the November 15 report was made public, AAP (kejriwal) is trying to get out of the situation by saying that the purpose of the investigation is not to name anyone
 unhone kaha, lekin report main naam he
 
 
 You cannot run a government with spectacle
 vipaksh ne dilli or jila cricket association (didisie) main bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaakar sheetakaaleen satr ke dauraan sansad kii kaarywahi baadhit kii thi or kejariwal ne vivaad ko lekar centre sarkaar par joardaar prahaar kiya tha
 Jaitley was the head of the DDCA for nearly 13 years until 2013, while he was not involved in the day-to-day activities as found by SFIO and gave him a clean chit in the UPA regime
 akbar ne kaha, jetali ne koi galati nahin kii
 But i believe that Kejriwal made a big mistake
 samvaadadaata sammelan main maujuud bijepi ke rashtriya pravaktaa shrikant sharma ne congress par prahaar karte hue kaha ki party bhaajapa or narendra modi sarkaar ko is tarah ke aarope lagaakar nahin 'daraa' sakati
 On the other hand, the Aam Aadmi Party hit back, saying if the BJP is so confident that he (jaitley) is clean then why is he running away from the investigation
 'aap' netaa ashutosh ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ne bhi kaha he ki jetali ko laalkrishna adwani kaa udhaaharan apnaanaa chahie, jinhone clinit milane tak hawala maamle main aaropon ke baad pad chhod diya tha
 Ashutosh said that Jaitley should go ahead and set an example before the country
 isse pehle unhone samiti kii report ko khaarij kar diya tha, lekin ab ve ise pavitra pustak kii tarah maan rahe hai
 The comments ashutosh ne daawa kiya, report main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki maamle main jaanch ayog kaa gathan hona chahie
 a busted person had already alerted the Delhi government that the formation of the commission through the Lt
 Governor would be stopped
 dilli ke mukhyamantri kejariwal ne twit karte hue kaha, yah dekhnaa dilachasp he ki kis tarah media gharaane jetali ji ko nirdosh sabit karne ke liye vyagr dikh rahe hai
 Why is Jaitley afraid to face investigation? This is the difference between BJP and 'AAP'
 'aap' thos saakshyon par kade or twarit kadam uthaati he
 The BJP defends and runs away from the investigation
 unhone ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, unhen (kejariwal ko) adaalat main apni galati sweekaar kerani chahie (jahaan jetali ne mukhyamantri or aap ke anya sadasyon ke khilaaf manahani kaa mukadmaa darj karaayaa he)
 He claimed that after the 'conspiracy' of the then Congress government, the Serious Fraud Investigation Office had investigated and found nothing against Jaitley, who is also the former head of the DDCA, when the 'congress' government was then
 ' He said that Kejriwal had attacked Jaitley in his press conference alleging that the CBI had raided the DDCA file
 akbar ne kaha, ab mukhyamantri khud hi funs gaye
 
 
 His own team has not received charges against Jaitley
 bijepi pravaktaa ne kaha ki 15 november kii report saarvajanik hone ke baad aap (kejariwal) yah kahkar sthiti se baahar nikalne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai ki jaanch kaa makasad kisi kaa naam lene kaa nahin he
 He said, but the report has a name
 
 
 aap tamaasha kar sarkaar nahin chalaa sakate
 The Opposition had disrupted Parliament proceedings during the winter session by accusing them of corruption in Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) and Kejriwal strongly attacked the central government over the controversy
 jetali 2013 tak kareeb 13 saalon tak didisie ke pramukh rahe, jabaki vah rojaanaa ke kaaryakalapon main shaamil nahin rahe the jaisaa ki esephaio ne paaya or upie shashan main unhen clinit di thi
 Akbar said, Jaitley made no mistake
 lekin meraa maananaa he ki kejariwal ne bahut badi galati kii
 BJP national spokesperson Shrikant Sharma, who was present at the press conference, attacked the Congress and said that the party cannot 'intimidate' the BJP and the Narendra Modi government by making such allegations
 udhar, aam aadmi party ne palatwaar karte hue kaha, agar bijepi ko itnaa hi vishwaas he ki vah (jetali) saaf hai to phir jaanch se kyon bhaag rahe hai
 AAP leader Ashutosh said that the Prime Minister has also said that Jaitley should follow the example of LK Advani, who left the post after allegations in the hawala case till he got a clean chit
 ashutosh ne kaha ki jetali ko aage badhkar desh ke samaksh udhaaharan pesh karnaa chahie
 Earlier, they rejected the committee's report, but now they consider it as a holy book

 agar aap android phone yujar hai to aapane mahasoos kiya hoga ki phone kharidne ke kuch maheenon baad hi aapkaa phone pehle ke mukaable thodaa slo ho gaya he
 This means that when you want to move from one app to another on the phone or return to the home screen after doing something, it takes a little longer than before
 or to or sambhav he ki kai baar aapkaa phone hang bhi ho jaataa ho
 However, if this is the case then your problem is not going to last any longer, because by using these 5 tips you can make your smartphone 'smart' as before - 1
 jin apps kaa istemaal nahin karte hai unhen Uninstall yaa disable karenhar phone main internal memory niyat hoti he
 One thing is to tie the knot, the more space in the internal memory of your phone, the better your phone will work
 sambhav he ki aapke phone ke bahut saare photos, music yaa apps hon, jis kaaran aapkaa phone slo kaam kar rahaa he
 If you want, you can store your photos, music and data from the phone by removing it from Dropbox or Google Drive cloud storage service
 iske saath hi vaise apps jinka istemaal aap nahin yaa kam karte hai unhen uninstall kar internal memory ko khaali kar sakate hai
 To uninstall apps: Go to the Settings of the phone and click on the Apps menu
 jis app ko uninstall karnaa chaahate hai use select karen or uninstall par clic karen
 However, there are many such apps in the phone from the company that cannot be uninstalled
 aise apps ko disable kar phone ko slo hone se bachaaya ja saktaa he
 Save apps to external memory
 If you need all apps and don't want to uninstall them, you can also save apps to external memory
 aisa karke bhi phone ke internal memory ko khaali kiya ja saktaa he
 To save apps to external memory, go to Settings and click on the Apps menu
 jis app ko move karnaa chaahate hai use select kar move to SD card par clic karen
 2
 app cache clear karanjab kabhi aap phone par app yaa internet istemaal karte hai to phone ke memory main app or broujar text ke rup main kaam or website kaa byoraa store kar detaa he
 This is because the next time you open the same website or use the same app, then it can quickly get the website or that work based on the information already saved
 lekin yah ek samasya bhi he, kyonki adhik text data store hone ke baad yah phone ko slo kar detaa he
 In such a situation it is necessary to remove it regularly
 kaise karen:vaise to cache clear karne ke liye phone ke settings main jaakar Apps menu main har app ko silect kar ek-ek kar cache clear kiya ja saktaa he, lekin yah ek jhamele kii tarah he
 It would be better if you download the free app like App Cache Cleaner, Clean Master or AVG tune up on Google Play and easily clear the cache in just one click
 ab smartphone kaa istemaal kar rahe hai to thodaa 'smart' to bananaa hi hoga
 3
 kam widgets kaa istemaal karen or live wallpapers ko naa kahenbahut se log yah tark de sakate hai ki widgets smartphone par kaam ko aasaan banaate hai, kyonki iske liye app ko kholane kii bajaay homescreen par uske widgets ko kholkar hi kaam ban jaataa he
 This is also true, but they do not say that widgets especially widgets like facebook affect your phone's battery backup as well as making your phone slow
 isliye behatar hoga agar aap widgets kaa istemaal kam hi karen
 To remove unnecessary widgets, press it on the home screen for 3-5 seconds and then drag it to the remove section at the top of the phone screen
 phone ko slo karne main live wallpapers kaa bhi bada yogadan rahata he
 Like widgets, they also have a negative effect on battery backup, so not saying live wallpaper would be better for your phone's health
 4
 Disable animation
 Further information is about advanced settings of the phone
 isaki jaankaree dene se pehle yah bataanaa jaruri he ki iske saath chhedchhad tabhi karen jab aap yah bakhubi jaan rahe hon ki aap kya kar rahe hai
 Currently, one change that you can do comfortably under this is that under this you can make the phone's processing fast by disabling the animation
 kaise karen:phone ke Settings main jaakar Developer options par clic karen phir neeche Drawing option main jaaen
 Turn off the Window animation scale, Transition animation scale and Animator duration scale here
 5
 Keep updating software Many of us believe that once you have bought the phone, there is no need to do any updates now
 lekin kai baar yah aapke liye jaruri he, kyonki samay-samay par phone yaa app company apane apadats bhejti he jo puraani samasyaon kaa hal hota he
 For example, if you are using an app and you are facing an issue, then it is possible that the company has solved the problem in the updated version of that app
 yah naa sirf aapaki samasya kaa hal hoga, balki isse webjah slo ho rahi phone kii processing ko bhi laabh milegaa

 The most powerful Bahubali rocket GSLV-MK3 was to be launched at 51 but 56
 24 minute pehle countdown roak diya gaya
 Immediately ISRO scientists started trying to find out where this technical shortage came just before the launch
 isro pravaktaa biaar guruprasad ne isro kii taraf se bayaan dete hue kaha ki jieselvi-emke3 launch whical (rocket) main khami aane kii vajah se lonching roak di gai he
 The next launch date will be announced soon

 24 minutes ago ISRO stopped the live screening at the Media Center and the Visitor Gallery
 takneekee khami dekhte hi launch kii prakriya roak di gai
 Because of this hindrance, the hard work of 11 years of ISRO scientists has received a small setback
 haalanki isro vaigyanikon ke dwaara antim kshanon main yah takneekee kami khoj lenaa bada kadam he
 If the rocket were left with this deficiency, a big accident could have happened
 yah vaigyanikon kii maharath he ki unhone galati khoj lee he
 a technical snag was observed in launch vehicle system at 1 hour before the launch
 As a measure of abundant precaution, # Chandrayaan2launch has been called off for today
 Revised launch date will be announced later
 — ISRO (@isro)july 14, 2019ye kaisaa inaam? Chandrayaan-2 se pehle sarkaar ne kaati ISRO vaigyanikon kii tankhwaahaye he chandrayan-2 kii lonching ko 56 minute pehle rokane kaa karanisro ke vishwast sutron ke mutabik jis samay lonching roki gai, us samay countdown kaa aakhri charan main tha
 a few minutes ago liquid hydrogen was loaded into the cryogenic engine
 cryogenic ingine or chandrayan-2 ko jodne vaale hisse ko launch whical kehete hai
 ISRO sources said that there was pressure leakage in this part only
 yah tay seemaa par sthir nahin ho rahaa tha
 The pressure needed for the launch was not there
 lagaataar ghatata ja rahaa tha
 Hence the launch of isro's moon mission Chandrayaan-2 was postponed
 kya chand par maanav basti ban paaegi? Chandrayaan-2 se kya he ummidpichley saal jisat-11 or 2013 main jieselvi-di5 kii lonching bhi taali gai theisse pehle pichley saal jisat-11 ko march-april main bheja janaa tha lekin jisat-6e mishan ke naakaam hone ke baad ise taal diya gaya
 The signal loss from GSAT-6A departing on 29 March caused a disturbance in the electrical circuit
 aisi ashanka thi ki jisat-11 main yahi dikkat saamne aa sakati he, isliye isaki lonching ko roak diya gaya tha
 After this several tests were done and it was found that all the systems are fine
 phir isaki lonching 5 disambar 2018 ko kii gai
 Even at that time, ISRO took a long time to complete the entire investigation process
 isro ne 2013 main jieselvi di-5 rocket kaa prakshepan bhi eendhan risaav ke chalate sthagit kar diya tha
 The announcement was made by the then ISRO chairman k Radhakrishnan
 unhone kaha tha ki eendhan risaav ke chalate ham jieselvi di-5 kaa prakshepan sthagit kar rahe hai
 Now we will take the rocket to the assembly building
 data kaa akalan karenge
 Detect the cause of fuel leakage
 tab bhi lonching tay samay se 74 minute pehle roak di gai thi
 Find out in 2 minutes - how Chandrayaan 2's Bahubali rocket was added, see why Chandrayaan-2 mission is important for VIDEO ISRO, five big reasons 1
 vaigyanik kshamta dikhaanaa - jab rus ne manaa kiya to ISRO vaigyanikon ne khud banaaya lander-rovernovember 2007 main roosi antariksh agency roscosmos ne kaha tha ki vah is project main saath kaam karegaa
 He will give Lander to ISRO
 2008 main is mishan ko sarkaar se anumati mili
 The design of Chandrayaan-2 was completed in 2009
 janvari 2013 main lonching tay thi, lekin roosi antariksh agency roscosmos lander nahin de pai
 ISRO fixed the launch of Chandrayaan-2 in March 2018
 lekin kuch test ke liye lonching ko april 2018 or phir oktober 2018 tak taala gaya
 Meanwhile, in June 2018, ISRO decided that Chandrayaan-2 will be launched in January 2019 by making some changes
 phir launch date badhaakar farvari 2019 kiya gaya
 The launch news was also reported in April 2019

 So, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi will stand to deliver the last speech of Modi government from Red Fort, will he say anything on the achievements and challenges of NITI Aayog?

 With a view to curbing black money and promoting cashless transactions across the country, on 8 November 2016, the Modi government announced demonetisation and banned the most driven currency of 500 and 1000 rupees in the economy
 kendra sarkaar ne cashles arthvyavastha ko badhaava dene ke liye bhim aadhaar placeform laanch kiya jiskaa makasad desh main chote kaarobaariyon ko cashles tranjaction ke liye protsaahit karnaa tha
 Due to these efforts, by April 2017, the Central Government identified 75 cities for low cash usage
 ise padhein: ye hai aam aadmi ke mudde, kya modi kii independence de spich main milegi jagah?desh or duniya ke zyaadaatar arthshaastriyon ne notebandi se lambii avadhi main phayda milane kaa daawa kiya
 But at present, if the communication and operation of cash is seen in the economy, it is clear that once again the dominance of the currency continues in the market
 notebandi se pehle aam aadmi ko jis dainik kaam ke liye cash tranjaction sarvaadhik sahuuliyat vaala tha ab ek baar phir cash usee bhoomika main pahunch chukaa he

 kendra sarkaar ne jiesti ke mudde par puure desh main aam sahmati banane main safalataa pai or july 2017 main puure desh main is nai kar vyavastha ko lagu kar diya gaya
 The NITI Aayog credited this success to Cooperative Federalism in the country and claimed that the central government has created an environment through which the center-state relationship is functioning in its best form
 lihaaja, yah daawa bhi kiya gaya ki jiesti se desh kii arthvyavastha ko tej gati se badhane kaa mauka milegaa
 At the same time as states have more resources, they will be able to grow at a faster pace
 sarkaar or gaiyrsarkari aarthik jaankaron ne bhi daawa kiya ki puure desh main jiesti purna rup se prabhavi hone ke baad desh ko dabl disit kii vikaas dar par le jane kaa kaam aasaan ho jayega vahiin kai rajya is shrenee main jiesti lagu hone ke ek-do saal main pahunch jaaenge
 Read this: Will PM Modi's speech from Red Fort this time focus on elections? Therefore, will the Modi government from Red Fort also tell that to what extent the target of NITI Aayog has been proved correct in a year after the implementation of GST and coming Will it be seen to be completely true in the coming days? 3

 Raghuvansh Prasad Singh raised the question as to why he avoided campaigning against BJP
 unhone nitish kumaar par tanj karte hue kaha ki wo kehete the sanghmukt bharat or ab upi main hi parhez kar rahe hai
 JDU recently decided that they will not contest elections in Uttar Pradesh nor will Nitish Kumar go there to campaign in favor of anyone
 jabaki samaajawaadee party or congress gathbandhan main chunaav lard rahi he

 Modi has now returned to Patna to meet some of the victims of the serial bomb blasts in Patna
 madad ke bahaane siyasat ke aaropon ke bich modi ne kaha ki ve peediton kaa dard baantne aae hai
 Earlier, Narendra Modi's convoy reached Kaimur during the day
 camoor ke vikaas naam ke ek noujvaan kii patna raily main maut ho gai thi
 Modi met the relatives of Vikas and consoled them
 modi ko isse aage gopalganj bhi janaa tha, lekin kharaab mausam ke kaaran vahaan unka helicopter nahin utar sakaa
 After this he returned to Patna
 camoor se pehle narendra modi gaurichak pahunche the
 There Modi met the families of the deceased Rajnarayan and handed over a check of five lakh rupees
 bijepi patna blast ke mritkon ke parijanon ko madad ke taur par 5-5 lakh rupee de rahi he
 According to the pre-decided schedule, Modi will be able to heal the wounds of the suffering families in Supaul, Begusarai and then Nalanda
 patna main 5 dinon pehle narendra modi bhaashan de rahe the or dhamaake ho rahe the
 But Modi came to know after 5 days of meeting the relatives of the victims of the blasts
 darasal, jab siyasat garmai, sawaal khadey hue, to modi ne patna kaa rukh kiya or pahunch gaye maramah lagane
 Narendra Modi arrived in Bihar for the second time in a week
 pehali baar kii tarah is baar kaa daura bhi siyaasi he
 But the method of politics is slightly different
 raily ke dauraan hue the dhamaakevo taarikh thi 27 oktober
 Seven blasts preceded Modi's rally and one after another during the rally
 raily kii jagah gandhi maidan ke chaaron ore chah dhamaake hue
 But neither Modi's rally stopped, nor did his speech stop
 siriyal dhamaakon main 6 logon kii maut ho gai
 But Modi did not express condolences during the rally
 haalanki raily ke baad twitor par modi ne dhamaake kaa shikaar hue logon ke prati sahanubhuti jataai
 By then, the opponents had got a chance to target
 jab modi par chautarafa hamale shuru hue, sawaal khadey kiye gaye ki dhamaake main maare gaye logon ke liye patna raily ke dauraan unhone chuppi kyon sadhi, tab aanan-fanan main bijepi ne modi ke maraham daure kaa elaan kiya
 However, Modi is once again in Bihar under Nitish Kumar's rule
 makasad ek tir se kai nishaanaa saadhane kaa he
 There is a politics of vote bank
 modi shaayad nitish ko yah sandesh bhi dena chaahate hai ki bihar unke agenda main sabase upar he
 Help for Modi is a matter of surprise that the affected families are also waiting for help from Modi
 peedit pariwaron kaa kahana he ki wo modi se apni madad or doshiyon ko kadi se kadi sajaa kii maang karenge
 The question is that the pain and sorrow the family members of those killed in the blasts have received, will Modi's ointment be effective on that? congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi( Rahul Gandhi)ne ravivaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi (PM Modi)par nishaanaa sadhate hue daawa kiya ki 2019 ke wibrant gujarat shikhar sammelan ke ‘‘naaraaz'' praayojak ab pradhanmantri kii adhyakshata vaale is kaarykram se jude nahin rahanaa chaahate

 unki teji se andar aati inaswinger par hafeez kaa wicket girane ke baad pakistani ballebaaj unki agali 16 gendon par koi ran nahin bana paae
 Bhubaneswar's havoc can also be understood from this bowling figure of his first six overs - 6 overs, 3 maiden, 11 runs, 2 wickets
 alam yah tha ki unki swing gendbaaji ne match main pakistani ballebaajon ko baandhe rakhaa
 In this match, his bowling figure was 9 overs, 3 maiden and 2 wickets for 27 runs
 vaise bhubaneshwar ne ab tak 44 vanade main keval 45 wicket liye hai or 2013 main unka pradarshan bhi koi bahut acha nahin rahaa
 At the same time, he is also troubled by the injury
 lekin agar wo australian condishan kaa phayda uthaane main kaamyaab rahe to team india ke liye bahut upyogi gendbaaj sabit ho sakate hai

 Premium charges apply !! There is such a buzz that Azam Khan is behind the red light that came out of Jaya Prada's car in Rampur
 pramukh samvaadadaata piyush babele ne ajam khan se is sambandh main baatcheet kii
 Here are the key parts of the conversation
 jab se jaya pradaa kii gaadi se laal batti utaar lee gai, tab se log kah rahe hai ki ajam sahab itane bade mantri ban gaye phir bhi maamuli adaavaton ko bhul nahin paa rahe?is ishyu se hamaara kuch lenaa-dena nahin he
 And on the day of this day, i went to find furniture for the university in the streets of Bareilly
 raat 1 baje rampur pahunchaa to meri ittila main aayaa ki ye vakya hokar nibat gaya he
 But about Rampur, the experience says that here you have a silent consent in every work? Neither this silence was of consent or of consent
 haa, mujhe waapas aakar pataa chalaa ki supreme court ke chif justise sahab ne koi faisla diya he laal battiyon ke istemaal par
 i myself do not use red light
 main mantri rahaa, rajyasabha main rahaa, lekin maine khud kabhi laal batti nahin lagaai
 Have you asked the rest of your mps to remove the red light? i have no concern with this
 koi aadmi apni gaadi kii chat par 50 laal battiyaan laga le
 What to do privipurs khatm hone ke baad bhi log apane ko raja or nawab likhte hai
 The presence of a red light, its size, its quality, its bright light does not determine the stature of a leader
 baapu kii gaadi par to kabhi laal batti nahin lagati thi, lekin baapu aaj tak baapu hai
 Well leave it, tell me what is your reaction to this whole matter? My case is that i am such a curious man about these power that even if done well, it is bad and do not insult, do anything bad or do anything bad
 Don't know what nahin karne par to koun-si gaali he jo mujhe nahin pad rahi he
 What would happen if something interfered with us? So i kept myself away from the reaction

 At one time Lord Vishnu was coming to visit the dead land, Lakshmi ji also requested to walk along
 vishnu ji bole- 'yadi main jo baat kahuun, vaise hi maano, to chalo
 'lakshmi ji accepted and Lord Vishnu, Lakshmi came on the earth including Jesus
 kuch der baad ek sthaan parabhagwan vishnu lakshmise bole- 'jab tak main na aauun, tum yahaan tehro
 i am going towards south, don't look there
 'vishnujike jane paralakshmi jiko kauthuk utpann hua ki aakhir dakshin disha main kya he jo mujhe manaa kiya gaya he or bhagwaan swayan dakshin main kyon gaye, koi rahasy jarur he
 Laxmi ji could not keep up, as soon as God caught the way, so did mother Lakshmi also followed
 kuch hi dur par sarson kaa khet dikhaai diya
 He was very blossoming and blooming
 ve udhar hi chalin
 She was enchanted by the beauty of the mustard and plucked her flowers and adorned her and went ahead
 aage ganne (eekh) kaa khet khadaa tha
 Lakshmi took four cane and started sucking juice
 usee kshan vishnu ji aae or yah dekh lakshmi ji par naaraaz hokar shaap diya- 'maine tumhen idhar aane ko manaa kiya tha, par tum na maanin or yah kisaan kii chori kaa aparaadh kar baithi
 Now you serve that farmer for 12 years as a punishment for this crime
 'aisa kahkar bhagwaan unhen chhodkarakshirsagarchale gaye
 Lakshmi started staying at the farmer's house
 vah kisaan ati daridr tha
 Laxmiji said to the wife of the farmer that after bathing you first worship this Goddess Lakshmi, then build the kitchen, you will get what you ask for
 kisaan kii patni ne lakshmi ke aadeshaanusaar hi kiya
 Due to the effect of worship and the blessings of Lakshmi, the farmer's house was filled with food, money, gems, gold etc
 from the very next day and began to glow with Lakshmi
 lakshmi ne kisaan ko dhan-dhaany se purna kar diya
 The farmer's 12 years were cut with great joy
 12 varsh ke baad lakshmi jane ke liye taiyaar huin
 When Vishnu came to take Lakshmijiko, the farmer refused to send him
 lakshmi bhi bina kisaan kii marji vahaan se jane ko taiyaar na thim
 Then Vishnuji made a clever move
 vishnuji jis din lakshmi ko lene aethe, us din vaaruni parv tha
 Therefore, while explaining the importance of Varuni festival to the farmer, God said that you, along with your family, go and bathe in the Ganges and leave these cowrie in the water too
 jab tak tum nahin lautoge, tab tak mailakshmiko nahin le jaaoongaa
 Laxmiji gave the farmer four cowries of Ganga
 kisaan ne vaisaa hi kiya
 He went to the family to take a bath in the Ganges
 jaise hi usne ganga main kodiyaan daaleen, vaise hi chaar haath ganga main se nikle or ve kodiyaan le leen
 The farmer then wondered whether she was a goddess
 tab kisaan ne gangaji se poocha 'he mata! ye chaar bhujaaen kiski hai?' gangaji boleen 'he kisaan! ve chaaron haath mere hi the
 Whose shells you have given, whose are they given? ”the farmer said -“ The woman who has come to my house, she has given
 ' is par gangaji boleen ki tumhaare ghar jo stri ai he vah saakshaat lakshmi hai or purush vishnu bhagwaan hai
 Don't let Lakshmi go, otherwise you will become poor again
 yah sun kisaan ghar laut aayaa
 Lord Lakshmi and Vishnu were sitting there ready to go
 kisaan ne lakshmi kaa anchal pakadaa or bolaa ki main tumhen jane nahin duungaa
 Then God told the farmer who let them go, but they are fickle
 kahin thaharti hi nahin, inako bade-bade nahin roak sake
 He was cursed by me, who was serving you for 12 years
 tumhaari 12 varsh seva kaa samay puraa ho chukaa he
 The farmer stubbornly said that no, i will not let Laxmiji go
 tum koi duusari stri yahaan se le jaao
 Then Laxmiji said - o farmer! If you want to stop me then do what i say
 kal teras he, main tumhaare liye dhanteras manaauungi
 Tomorrow you clean the house with a leap-vessel
 raatri main ghi kaa deepak jalaakar rakhana or sanykaal meraa pujan karnaa or ek tambe ke kalash main rupaya bharkar mere nimitt rakhana, main us kalash main nivas karuungi
 But i will not show you at the time of worship
 main is din kii puja karne se varsh bhar tumhaare ghar se nahin jaaoongi
 If i want to keep worshiping me every year like this
 yah kahkar ve dipakon ke prakaash ke saath dason dishaao main fail gayi or bhagwaan dekhte hi rah gaye
 The next day the farmer worshiped according to the story of Nelakshmiji
 uskaa ghar dhan-dhaany se purna ho gaya
 Similarly, he started worshiping Lakshmiji every year on the thirteenth day
 hindu yuva vahini sena ke sarvesarva yogi adityanath hai jo ab puure soobe ke senapati ban gaye hai
 The courage of this army is on the seventh sky on the Yogi's Raja Yoga
 lekin sawaal ye he ki khud yogi ke liye is sena kii ab kya ahmiyat bachi, tab jabaki wo upi kii sarvocch siyaasi pad par virajman ho chuke hai
 The question is what is the future of the Hindu Yuva Vahini? Yogi Adityanath's stature has steadily increased in Gokhpur due to the political devotion of supporters and the strength of this organization and he remained unbeatable for five elections
 yogi ko kamyaabi ke shikhar par bithaane main is sanghathan kaa kitna haath rahaa jaraa ye jaan lijie:-- yogi adityanath ne 2002 ke april main ramanavami ke din hindu yuva vahini sena kaa gathan kiya tha
 - Yogi Adityanath formed it under the Society Registration Act
 - gathan ke vakt yogi ne ise ek vishuddh rup se saanskrithik sanghathan bataaya tha jiskaa makasad hindusvirohi, rashtravirohi gatividhiyon ko rokna bataaya gaya
 Before the formation of the Hindu Yuva Vahini, Yogi was able to win the Lok Sabha elections by losing two elections
 - 1998 kaa chunaav yogi ne 26 hajaar maton se jeeta tha or 1999 kaa chunaav sirf 7322 maton se
 - As the formation of the Hindu Yuva Vahini, the distance of Yogi's victory increased, the 2014 Lok Sabha election Yogi Adityanath won by more than 3 lakh votes
 - yogi adityanath ne hindu yuva vahini ko gorakhpur ke daayre se baahar nikaalkar puure purvanchal main isaki majboot netwarking kii
 - The strength of the Hindu Yuva Vahini increased so much that at its foundation, Yogi Adityanath continued to pressurize the BJP and keep his word
 -2002 ke chunaav main gorakhpur shahar se yogi ne hindu yuva vahini kaa ummidavaar utarkar bijepi ke adhikrut ummidavaar ko harva diya

 It is said that on this night, who chants his name while meditating on Sri Krishna, all his wishes are fulfilled, but this year due to the inferiority of both the planet Venus associated with Lord Krishna and the planet Mars associated with Radha and the Rohini constellation of Moon

 Not only this, by worshiping on this day, children like Sri Krishna also get merits
 lekin ye din unke liye khaas taur par khushiyaan lekar aata he jo vansh kii chintaa main ghule ja rahe hai
 Religious experts say that God does not forget to give blessings to his descendants on Janmashtami
 bas unhen khaas mantron kaa jaap karnaa hota he
 The importance of Janmashtami can be gauged from the fact that its fast is called Vratraj
 ye manyata he ki is ek din vrath rakhane se kai vraton kaa fal mil jaataa he or agar bhakt paalane main bhagwaan ko jhula den to unki sari manokamanaayen puri ho jaati hai

 Recently, the geographical identity of Rasgulla was added with West Bengal
 india tudene is par do saal pehle ek vishad report prakashit kii thi
 We are republishing it for readers
 rasagulla kaa naam lete hi munh main mithaas si ghul jaati he
 Most people know that Rasgulla is from West Bengal while some believe that it is originally from Odisha
 lekin is rasagulle ne donon rajyon ke bich ek kadavaahat kii lakeer khinch di thi
 In order to assert its authority over Rasgulla, Odisha and West Bengal had even formed government committees to stake their claim
 katak or bhubaneshwar ke bich sthit pahaal main hive ke donon kinare varshon se lagane vaala rasagulle kaa thok bazaar apane kaarobaar main mashgool he
 Unaware of their claim to Odisha and West Bengal regarding the discovery of Rasgulla
 pahaal rasagulle ke liye bahut mashhoor he
 Hundreds of decorated shops are crowded with customers
 taaja rasagulle kii vibhinn variety khilaane or dur-daraaj ke ilaakon main supplai ke liye unki packaging main lage kaarobaari donon rajyon kii is daavedaari se bakhbar hai ki aakhir donon rajyon main is mishthan kaa nirmaan pehle kahaan hua
 Is Rasgulla from Odisha or West Bengal? On hearing this question, the shopkeeper Mukesh Nayak flares up, "are you new?" By someone's claim, the place of construction of Rasgulla will be changed slightly
 yah mithai odisha kii he
 It was first built here
 jaao madlaapanji (shrijagannatha ji ke itihaas main darj tathy sambandhi pustak) dekho jaakar
 "in it it has been called Chhena Ladoo, Rasgola and Rasgulla

 Ramkishore Vajpayee, who came here from Kanpur, says, "what we need from this, sweetness is dissolving in the mouth, that's a lot
" donon hi pradesh desh ke hisse hai
 No foreigner is claiming it
 "odisha or pashchim bengal kii yah raar ab nirnaayak mode par pahunchati dikh rahi he
 West Bengal is agreeing that its GI tag (geographical identification) tag on Rasgulla will be confined to the state only
 lekin mamata banerjee sarkaar ke khaadya mantri jyotipriy mallik iskaa daawa chhodane ko bilkul taiyaar nahin dikhte
 He said that Saada Rasgulla is completely different from Rasgulla in Odisha
 pashchim bengal sarkaar tathy juta rahi he
 Rasgulla's Bangla accent Rosogulla may have brought Kolkata to mind, to dissolve the sweetness in the mouth, but to look at the facts, the pan of Odisha looks heavy
 vahiin apni ek sarkari samiti kii report ke aadhaar par bhi odisha ne rasagulla par apana daawa sahi tehraaya or apni peeth thapthapa lee he
 He is trying to get the GI tag of Rasgulla

 It is called the day of Niladri Vijay
 15veen shatabdi main likhit dandi ramayana main rasagulla kaa ullekh miltaa he
 Odisha poet Balaramdas has described Rasgulla in his poetic Dandi Ramayana in the Ayodhya episode as an offering to God
 odisha sarkaar ke daawey kaa aadhaar aise hi pramaan hai
 In fact, the controversy started when the Odisha government tried to get a GI tag last year regarding the rasgullas found in the hill

 In this respect, the claim of Bengal is strong
 vaise, ab tak log yahi samajhate the ki rasagulla vishuddh bengali mithai he
 And if more history is explored, in many places it will also be mentioned that Rasgulla is an evolved form of any Portuguese dish

 However, there is a sweet war between the two states
