 dengue chikangunia ke badhate maamle or machharon ke aatank se juujhati rajdhani dilli main har koi is baat se pareshaan he ki machharon se nipta kaise jaae
 a recent research by the International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology has revealed that the MCD exercise to combat dengue chikungunya mosquitoes has been delayed
 vector born dijijij kii head dow
 According to Sujata Sunil, the work of fogging and spraying should start in pre-monsoon so that the breeding of mosquitoes can be stopped only
 dow
 Sujata said that if the work of fogging, spraying and breeding checking is done before the monsoon in only those areas of Delhi where there is scarcity of water and people store water, then these mosquitoes should be destroyed before they can flourish
 Can
 monsoon se pehle breeding behad kam hoti he or isiilie us samay machharon ko khatm karnaa or panpane se rokna aasaan hota hai
 As soon as the monsoon starts, their breeding becomes many times faster and the number of these mosquitoes turns into millions of crores
 aise main ab phoging or spranying se machharon ko maarna behad mushkil ho jaataa he
 It has also been proved in research that these mosquitoes can complete their life cycle without a human body
 isliye kisi bhi pani vaali jagah par inkaa panapana behad aasaan he
 MCD is doing fogging and sprinkling in different areas day and night but mosquitoes seem impossible to control
 lekin shaayad yahi kavayad pre monsoon kar di jaati to aise halaat hi paidaa nahin hote
 Using these chemicals, MCD has four different stages of dengue, chikungunya mosquitoes, which MCD have different chemical and equipment to thrive or kill
 jinka istemaal karke ye machharon ko khatm karne kii koshish karte hai
 Use of Temifos granules in cooler or tank water is very effective to prevent mosquitoes from growing
 nagar nigam ke malaria inspector dinesh sharma kaa bhi kahana he ki in grenules ko daalane ke baad aap cooler or tank ko 15 din baad bhi saaf karenge to iskaa asar bana rahegaa
 Used to mix kerosene, the bactericide is used to kill mosquitoes at the Chemical Larva stage, which is put into a pitcher pump and sprayed into drains and other watery areas
 jisase machharon ko panpane se roka ja saktaa hai
 In addition, fogging is more effective than wall spraying, using alphasiper methane, which is made by mixing with kerosene and sprayed on the walls of homes
 iskaa asar teen maheene tak rahata he or machhar diwaar par baithte hi uske kaantect main aakar mar jaataa he

 While on the one hand the Bihar government is focusing on promoting tourism as well as developing tourist places, on the other hand, the ministers of the government are seen making controversial statements about tourists
 bihar sarkaar ke madh nishedh evam utpaada mantri abdul jaleel mastaan ne kaha ki bihar ko paryatakon se kuch nahin miltaa, balki paryatak sirf bihar kii dharti ko ganda karte hai
 Drinking will not be allowed in Bihar
 After the cancellation of Purna Sharabbandikanun from Patna High Court, alcohol prohibition and excise minister Abdul Jalil Mustan said that no one will be allowed to drink alcohol on the soil of Bihar
 mantri ne kaha ki chaahe wo bihar kii janata ho yaa phir sena ke jawan yaa phir paryatak, bihar main kisi bhi keemat par sharaab pine kii ijaajat nahin di jaaegi
 Going a step ahead about the tourists, Minister Abdul Jalil Mustan said that tourists will not be allowed to drink liquor in Bihar and tourists do not get anything from Bihar but they go to pollute the soil of Bihar
 'supreme court main di jaaegi chunauti'patna hai court ke faislaper bolte hue mantri ne kaha ki hai court ke faisle ko supreme court main chunauti di jaaegi
 He said that complete prohibition is in force in Bihar and will remain in force
 bihar main sharaab par pratibandh ko lekar bihar sarkaar patibaddh he
 'the public is saddened by the hc's decision', said that the High Court verdict would remain the verdict as the new liquor prohibition law, which came into force in Bihar from October 2, was passed by both houses of the Bihar Legislature
 mantri ne kaha ki hai court ke faisle se bihar kii janata dukhi he
 He said that the people of Bihar had wholeheartedly welcomed the government's decision to ban total liquor in the state
 kathor kanoon ko saraahaamantri ne kaha ki kathor kanoon se hi bihar main purna sharabbandi ko safal banaaya ja saktaa he, kamjor kanoon se yah abhiyaan safal nahin ho saktaa
 The minister said in a threatening tone that neither drinking liquor from other states will be allowed to come to Bihar at any cost, nor will smuggling liquor from other states be brought to Bihar
 unhone kaha ki jo bhi aisa karte pakade jaaenge unako bakhsha nahin jayega
 Till now, you must have seen the terrorists caught in India under the grip of the police and have only heard the exploits
 lekin ham aapako bataaenge ki mumbai hamale main aatanki ajmal aamir kasaab ko hindi sikhaane vaale teacher abu jundaal ko kaise hindustan main mili aatankwaadi banane kii trainig
 Now this secret has been revealed how not only in Pakistan, but just 200 km from Mumbai for 26 / 11 attack of Mumbai
 dur chali aatank kii paathshaala
 How the terrorists who were prepared in that school of terror are still shaking India
 ajtak kaa 'oparation naag' desh ke un dushmano ke chehron ko benakaab karegaa, jiskaa jehar dhamaakon kii shakl main hindustan ko dans rahaa he
 For the first time we are going to show you four pictures of terror
 tasviren main dikh rahe chehre jitani ahm he, usase kahin zyada sansanikhej he wo ilaaka, jahaan in tasveeron ko kaid kiya gaya, wo bhi 26 / 11 hamale se thik do saal pehle
 So far, the plot of 26 / 11 terror attack is seen to be linked with Pakistan, but the photos reveal that the school of terror was running 200 km away from Mumbai
 aatanki kii ye tasviren aurangabad shahar ke ek gupt thikaane kii he
 The destination of terror, where the 26 / 11 attacks are linked
 wo thikaana, jahaan aatanki aamir ajmal kasaab kaa teacher 26 / 11 hamale kii taiyaari kar rahaa tha
 One of the terrorists is Jabuddin Ansari alias Abu Jundal
 iske thik bagal main baitha he aantkiyon kaa guru faiyaz kagaji
 These photos are exactly two years before the 26 / 11 attack
 yani do saal pehle se hi pakistan main hi nahin, balki mubai par hamale kii sajeesh mumbai se behad kareeb aurangabad ke ek gupt thikaane par banaai ja rahi thi
 In the photos, Fayaz Kagji is simultaneously giving a class of jihad to many boys
 faiyaz logon ko is class ke jariye gumraah karne kii koshish main juta he
 Two more boys are also seen in the pictures, about which the investigative agencies have not yet received any specific information
 lekin sutron ke mutabik ye donon ladke aurangabad hathiyaar cese main shaamil hai or philhal faraar hai
 In one photo, Fayaz Kagji is trying to show Himayat Baig some books in the terrorist's library
 aapako bataa den ki himaayat beg ko saal 2010 main mumbai aties ne pune ke german bekri bam blast main pakadaa tha, jise faansee kii sajaa sunai ja chuki he
 There is a picture of some religious program, where all the boys are being tried to motivate them completely to become terrorists
 is aatank kii paathshaala main talim lene ke baad class ke ladakon ne jo kiya, usne hindustan ko kabhi naa bhuulane vaala dard diya
 After learning of terror in this class, Abu Jundal became so dreaded that he went to Pakistan and joined the preparations for the Mumbai attack and trained 10 Pakistani attackers coming to share death not only in Hindi but also in the control room of Karachi
 He sat and gave instructions on the phone to all the terrorists including Kasab for the attack
 ye aatank kii sabase khaufnak class mumbai se behad kareeb chal rahi thi, lekin desh kii kisi bhi jaanch agency ko koi bhanak nahin lag pai
 The result is in the face of Mumbai attack

 During the proceedings in Lok Sabha on Tuesday, the uproar of the opposition mps increased so much that they threw paper on the speaker while shouting slogans
 isse sumitra mahajan behad dukhi huin
 He expressed unhappiness, "I am deeply saddened by the way the Chair behaved
" spikar ne dukhi man se kaha, 'yah koi tarika nahin he
 Today i am deeply saddened by the way the Chair was treated
 aapke virodh kaa tarika uchit nahin he
 Throwing paper is not right at all

 ' sumitra mahajan isse pehle hi sansad main vipaksh ke hangaame ke chalate lagaataar baadhit kaamkaaj se behad naaraaz thim
 Angered by the opposition's blockade in Parliament, Spiker criticized the mps who were protesting in bitter words
 darasal, loksabhaa kaarywahi ke dauraan aaj bhi kuch vipakshi saansad wel main aa gaye or unhone sadan kii kaarywahi ko baadhit kiya
 Subsequently, Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan said that 'there are only 40-50 people who are not letting the house run
 ' spikar ne kaha ki 'in logon kii tasviren tivi par dikhaai jaani chahie taaki desh ke logon ko pataa chale ki ye 40-50 log 440 saansadon ko kaam nahin karne de rahe hai
 It is a murder of democracy and democracy
 yah sab tivi par puure hindustan ko jarur dikhaanaa janaa chahie ki hamaare saansad kaisaa vyavhaar kar rahe hai
 After this, the proceedings of the Lok Sabha were adjourned till 2
15 pm
 isse pehle sadan kii kaarywahi na chalane dene par loksabhaa adhyaksh ne congress ke 25 saansadon ko nilambit tak kar diya tha, lekin iskaa bhi koi khaas asar nahin dikhaa
 The comments haalanki congress ko sadan main virodh ke chalate samaajawaadee party ke mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav kaa virodh bhi jhelana padaa tha
 Mulayam Singh Yadav had said in a warning tone, 'it has become too much, if you people keep opposing in this way, then we will not be able to support you
 ' It is noteworthy that since the start of the monsoon session, the attitude of the Congress is tough
 congress sushamaa swaraj, shivaraj singh chouhan or vasundhara raaje ke istife kii maang kar rahi he
 Therefore, due to the opposition of Congress and Opposition in the session started on 21 July, not a single day has been completed
 congress party ne saaf kiya he ki jab tak sarkaar sabhi daagi mantriyon ko unke pad se nahin hataati he tab tak ve sansad kii kaarywahi chalane nahin denge
 Specker said sadly, 'this is not the way
 jis tarah chair ke saath vyavhaar kiya gaya, usase aaj main bahut dukhi hum
 Your method of protest is not appropriate
 kaagaj phenkna katai sahi nahin he
 Behave Your Self

 sansad main vipaksh ke avrodh se naaraaz spikar ne behad talkh lafjon main virodh kar rahe saansadon kii aalochana kii thi
 In fact, during the Lok Sabha proceedings even today some opposition mps came to Vail and they disrupted the proceedings of the House
 iske baad loksabhaa spikar sumitra mahajan ne kaha ki 'sirf 40-50 log hai jo house ko chalane nahin de rahe hai

 # 'gudadi ke laal' vaali kahawat jharkhand ke bedo ilaake main rahane vaali munnavati par bilkul feet baithti he
 Munnavati Devi, who belongs to a very poor family, has such a passion to read that poverty did not come in her way
 jab parivaaravale uski padhai kaa kharch nahin uthaa paae, to vah kharch uthaane ke liye dihadi mazdooree karne lagi
 Wages by day and then studying at night
 aap yah jaankaar dang rah jaaenge ki is bala ne aise vishay main eme, emphil kii, jisase achche-achche dur bhaagate hai
 Yes, Sanskrit


 a subject that chews a lot
 itnaa hi nahin, munnavati ne gold medal bhi hasil kiya he
 At the convocation organized by Ranchi University, the Union Home Minister honored Munnavati by giving her a gold medal
 ranchi uniwarsity ke kanvocation program main kaale goun or laal scorf main desh ke grahamantri susheel kumaar scindia ke haathon gold medal paakar munnavati khushi se chahak rahi thi
 It was also thought that his destiny is to work as a daily wage laborer in the village
 ranchi ke ek sudur naksal prabhavit bedo gaanv kii rahane vaali munnavati kii mazdooree se lekar medal hasil karne tak kii kahani apane-aap main ek misaal he
 Whoever listened to it, had tears in his eyes
 ek behad hi garib parivaar se taalluk rakhane vaali munnavati ne lakh adchanon ke hote hue bhi kabhi padhai kaa daaman nahin choda
 As a child, the shadow of the father was removed from his head
 ek bhai he, jo berozegaar he
 Kidney disease to the mother on the other hand
 aise main jab ghar main khaane ke laale pade hon, to padhai to dur kii baat thi
 But Munnavati did not give up
 usne mazdooree shuru kii, jisamen use dinabhar haadtod mehnat ke paanch rupee milte the
 Worked during the day and continued to study at night
 phir aisa din bhi aayaa, jab satr 2010-12 main unhone kul 1600 ank main se 1046 yani 65
 Topped the Ranchi University in Sanskrit with 35 per cent marks and captured the gold medal
 bakaul munnavati, ghar main bhojan-pani kii sthiti bahut hi najuk he
 One has to think of evening meal after dinner
 haalanki aaj wo gold medal paakar nihaal he
 At the same time, Munnavati's mother wishes to serve the village
 munnavati kumari shuru se hi meghavi chaatra rahi he
 Everywhere from elementary education to higher education, he has achieved the feat of his success
 ekikrut bihar ke samay 1998 main usne bihar vidhyalay pariksha board se pratham shrenee main matriculation kiya tha
 Then she started teaching matriculation students in a school with wages
 garibi ke kaaran paanch saal baad bedo se inter or grajuation kii degree hasil kii
 After that she reached Ranchi to do MA
 lekin jab bhi chuttee milti, vah mazdooree kar aarthik jaruratein puri karti
 Hard work paid off and he topped the university and became a gold medalist
 munnavati misaal he unke liye, jo garibi se ghabaraakar shiksha se dur ho jate hai
 However, even after taking the gold medal, his struggle will still continue
 munnavati aage jaakar professor bananaa chaahati he or un logon ko shikshit karnaa chaahati he, jo paise ke abhaav main padhai nahin kar pate

 The Foreign Exchange Regulations Act (FERA) was enacted during the government of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
 jiske tahat bharat main udyog lagane vaali koi bhi videshi company desh main 40 fisadi se zyada hissedari nahin rakh sakati thi
 Hence, foreign companies had to sell majority stake in their Indian subsidiaries
 furnandis chaahate the ki coca cola na sirf apni hissedari kaa sthanantaran kare, balki iskaa formula bhi shairdharakon ko de
 coca-cola agreed to the transfer of the stake, but refused to give the formula citing business secrecy
 lihaaja sarkaar ne coca cola ko bharat main peya padaarth aayaat karne kaa license dene se manaa kar diya
 Due to which the company had to leave India
 jorge ne iske baad desi drink-77 launch kiya
 However, the Congress under PV Narasimha Rao's government underwent a period of liberalization and coca-cola once again became a part of the Indian market

 After this, there was a change of power at the center, the Congress government lasted for 10 years, but no decision was taken on it

 ab isi hafte is group kii baithak bulaai jaaegi
 Apart from former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha in the group Ghulam Nabi Azad, former Home Minister P
P
 chidambaram, varisht netaa karn singh, pradesh congress adhyaksh ghulaam ahamed mir, pradesh kii prabharee mahasachiv ambika soni shaamil hai
 Two leaders from Jammu region have also been included in this group
 is group main sanyojak kii bhoomika main ambika soni hai
 Currently has gone to Kolkata for the meeting of the Defense Committee
 ambika soni ne 'ajtak' se kaha ki, "satta ke laalach main rajya main do alag vichaardhaaraon ke bich hua gathjod hi samasya kii jad he
 The promises made by the PM during the floods have not been fulfilled yet
 vikaas kaa vaada bhi dharaa kaa dharaa rah gaya
 On the contrary, the situation in Kashmir has become worse today
 modi sarkaar kii kashmir niti saaf nahin he
 "with this, Congress leader Ambika Soni said," The important group that Sonia Gandhi has formed on the Kashmir issue, returning from Kolkata, i will take the time to fix the meeting of that group
 jiske baad congress party samasya ke hal ke liye apana paksh or raay jaahir karegi
 But, for the moment i can only say that the Modi government is failing on the Kashmir issue
 "sutron ke mutabik,congressko lagata he ki kashmir mudde par modi sarkaar fail rahi he
 But this is a sensitive issue, so instead of just encircling the Modi government, the Congress should come out with its views to solve the problem in the role of a positive opposition
 isiilie manmohan singh, karn singh, aaazaad or chidambaram sareekhe netaaon ke jariye congress apane paksh ke saath janata ke saamne aana chaahati he
 As it is, the Congress believes that the Manmohan government was running on the Vajpayee government whose policies are being advocated today, which was criticized by the then BJP and Narendra Modi for the policies being weak
 vahiin satta main aane ke baad modi sarkaar kii kashmir ko lekar spasht niti nahin rahi ulte pidipi se bemail gathjod kar liya, jisase ghati ke halaat or bighad gaye
 In Madhya Pradesh, the politics of trained dogs posted in the police department has intensified
 46 kutton ke tabadale par vipaksh hamalavar he, vahiin baikfoot par najar aati rahi sarkaar bhi ab gear badalati najar aa rahi he
 On Monday, a minister of the state's Congress government described the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party as a dog-like party
 vahiin ab shivaraj sarkaar ke dauraan kiye gaye kutton ke tabadale kii suchi bhi saamne ai he
 Narendra Saluja, media advisor to Chief Minister Kamal Nath, has released a list of dog transfers in 2018 during the BJP government
 saluja ne kaha he ki vah yah suchi purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko bhejenge
 Saluja said that transfer of dogs is a common practice
 march 2018 main jab shivaraj singh chouhan mukhyamantri the or bhaajapa kii sarkaar thi
 Even then the dogs were transferred
 shivaraj singh chouhan kii sarkaar main hue kutton ke tabadalaa aadesh kii prati (photoh raveesh paal singh)saluja ne kaha he ki kutton kaa tabadalaa koi pehali baar nahin kiya gaya he
 This has been happening before also
 gauratlab he ki pichley dinon kamalnath sarkaar ne adhikariyon or karmchaariyon ko idhar se udhar karne ke baad 46 kutton ke tabadale kaa aadesh jari kiya tha
 Along with the dogs, their handlers were also transferred
 shivaraj singh chouhan kii sarkaar main hue kutton ke tabadalaa aadesh kii prati (photoh raveesh paal singh)mukhyamantri kamalnath ke grih janapad chhindwara se ek snifer dog sarkaar ke is aadesh ke baad pradesh main siyasat garm ho gai thi
 The opposition BJP had opened a front against the government
 jisase sattadhari baikfoot par aa gai thi

 Let me tell you that Sajjan Singh Verma, a minister in Kamal Nath government, criticized the BJP for giving political color to the transfer of dogs

 chaahe vah keshubhai patel rahe hon, chaahe anandiben patel yaa phir nitin patel hi kyon nahin bhaajapa ne inhe doum darje par hi rakhaa
 Took the chair of Anandiben Patel
 nitin patel ko aakhri vakt main siem nahin banane diya gaya
 The BJP is facing difficulty with such allegations
 sutron kaa kahana he ki in paristhitiyon kii samiksha karne ke baad bhaajapa main yah soch ban rahi he ki patel voter jo bhaajapa ke saath hai unamem utsahvardhan ke liye or jo patel voter jo bhaajapa se chhitakane kii kagaar par hai unhe ekajute karne ke liye yah sanket diya jaae ki chunaav ke baad satta kii kaman patelon ke haathon main hi rahegi
 For this, it is necessary that a Patel candidate is declared as the CM candidate before the first phase of voting
 iske liye nitin patel pehali pasand maane ja rahe he
 Significantly, the BJP has implemented this strategy in Himachal Pradesh when Prem Kumar Dhumal was declared as the CM candidate from the election rally and an attempt was made to help the Rajput voters
 goa chunaav main haalanki manohar parrikar ko pratyaashee to ghoshit nahin kiya gaya tha lekin press brifing or aam sabhaaon ke jariye paroksh rup se parrikar ko siem pratyaashee bataaya ja rahaa tha
 After the Goa election, the BJP in its review had found that if Parrikar had already been declared the CM candidate of Goa, the party could have got a majority on its own

 Sources said that Geelani, already facing a confrontation with Pak Army Chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, is unlikely to apologize to the court
 paak raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke maamalon ko phir se kholane main vifal rahane par adaalat ne unke khilaaf avmaananaa notice jari kiya tha or unase vyaktigat rup se pesh hone ko kaha tha
 Sources in the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) and its legal team reported that a consensus among the party's top leadership over not writing letters to Swiss authorities not apologizing to the judiciary or reopening alleged money laundering cases against Zardari is
 raashtrapati ke ek kareebi sahyogi ne bataaya, ‘guuruuvaar ko jab pradhanmantri gilaani avmaananaa maamle main adalati kaarywahi main pesh honge to na to vah maafee maangenge or na hi swiss adhikariyon ko patr likhane kaa supreme court ko koi aashwaasan denge
 The aide said, "we believe the court will be satisfied with the Prime Minister's appearance
" meraa maananaa he ki pradhanmantri ke rukh se sambandhit logon kii bhavanaaen shant hongi
 Although Gilani's lawyer Etjaz Ahsan noted that the prime minister is not guilty of contempt, he should bow to pressure and ask Swiss authorities to reopen corruption cases
 ahsaan ne kaha ki raashtrapati jaradaari ko aapraadhik maamalon main pakistan or videsh main puri chhot praapt he or unhen mili sanvaidhanik chhot adhishuchet kii gai he
 Therefore, the Prime Minister is not guilty of contempt
 pakistan ke sheersh nyaayalay ne aadesh kaa paalan nahin karne ke maamle main somvaar ko pradhanmantri gilaani ke khilaaf avmaananaa kaa notice jari kiya
 The notice has been issued by the court on the direction of the court for not restarting the corruption case against President Zardari and disobeying orders in two other cases about two years ago
 adaalat ne gilaani se guuruuvaar ko vyaktigat taur par adaalat main upasthit hone ko kaha he
 a lawyer for the ppp's legal team says that the Prime Minister will refer to constitutional provisions regarding the reasons for not writing letters to the Swiss authorities
 rashtriya sulah adhyadesh (enarao) radd karne ke baad varsh 2009 se hi sheersh nyaayalay pipipi netritv vaali sarkaar se bhrashtachar ke maamle ko dobaaraa shuru karne ko kah rahaa he
 The NRO was issued by former military ruler Pervez Musharraf under which corruption cases cannot be pursued against certain people
 sarkaar ne yah kehete hue adaalat kaa aadesh maanane se inkaar kar diya ki raashtrapati ko samvidhan ke antargat chhot hasil he
 Gilani also has the support of Parliament on this issue
 sansad ne haal hi main ek loktantr samarthak sankalp paarit kiya he
 In his speech at the National Assembly, Geelani asked the judiciary and the army to protect democracy, despite differences with his government

 But on the evening of Vijayadashami last October 3, soon after the burning of Ravana at the Gandhi Maidan in Patna, the stampede took away their support

 33 people have been killed in this accident
 aitvarpur ke ajay mistre ne bhi apane 11 varshiya iklaute bete ko ganvaa diya
 These heartbreaking incidents are of the Gandhi Maidan where Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi himself was presiding over the Ravana Dahan program
 maanjhi shaam 6 baje vahaan se gaya jile ke apane gaanv mahakaar ke liye ravaanaa hue to patna ke varisht police adheekshak (esaspi) manu maharaj logon kii phikr chhod mukhyamantri ko vidaa karne shahar ke aakhri chor tak gaye
 Here, District Collector Manish Kumar Verma also quietly moved from there to attend his child's birthday party organized in a prominent hotel in the city
 (haadase se pehle gandhi maidan main ravan dahan ke maukey par juty apaar bheed)or phir ho gaya haadasaapane aakaaon ke jate hi maatahat afasaron or karindon ne bhi ise apane kartavya kii itishree samaj liya or apane tay kaam se chuttee paa lee
 Only two gates were left open for the huge crowd of about four lakh people who were gathered to attend this prom
 bhagdad kii sabase jaahir vajah thi-kaarykram ke khatm hone ke baad bhi geton ko band rakhaa janaa
 Eyewitnesses claim that only the southern gate was open to the public, while two gates on the west side were reserved for vips
 gandhi maidan ke baahar bane coukachar (maweshiyon ke pinjade) ko bhagdad kii vajah mana ja rahaa he
 People were still frantic to get out that cattle cages, open drains and poor light system created more problems for them
 dekhte hi dekhte aadhe ghante ke bheetar aisi bhagdad machi ki 32 log to maukey par hi kuchalakar maare gaye or buree tarah ghayal ek vyakti ne baad main patna medical college or aspataal (piemasiech) main dam tod diya
 The system of sending information in the capital Patna was so sluggish that it took more than an hour to convey the information of the accident to Manjhi
 bich raste main shaam 7
 Manjhi received this news at 30 pm, but in his speeches, the Chief Minister, who called for a poor family, did not consider it appropriate to return
 gaanv pahunchakar maanjhi ne apane parivaar ke saath ratribhoj main paalak ke saag kaa swaad liya
 They have been playing this ritual of Dussehra day for years
 haalanki raat 10
 At 30, they returned to Patna, but could reach the PMCH only after midnight to meet the victims
 rakt par baari maanjhi kii rasmmanjhi kii praathamiktaaon ko dekhakar kai logon kii bhaunhen tan gayi- aakhir jab unase haadase se vilaap karti rajdhani main fouran lautne kii ummid thi, unhone ek paariwarik rasm puri karnaa jaruri samaj
 However, returning to Patna, 70-year-old Manjhi took swift steps and removed the DM and SSP of Patna besides the Commissioner and DIG
 haalanki ise ab bhi itani viraat traasadee kii evaj main 'bahut kam' sajaa mana ja rahaa he
 But this drastic action against senior bureaucrats has increased Manjhi by a few inches
 maanjhi kii tatkaal faisle lene kii yah kaaryastylee unke purvavarti nitish kumaar se bilkul juda he
 Nitish's favorite action was on any incident or controversy, the inquiry committee announced
 november 2012 main jab patna main chhath kaa tyohaar manaane ke dauraan aisi hi bhagdad main 19 log maare gaye the, to nitish ne ek jaanch samiti kaa gathan kiya tha
 The committee later acquitted all government officials
 july 2013 main mid-de mile se hui maut or aktubar 2013 main gandhi maidan main hue bam dhamaakon ke baad bhi unhone aisi hi jaanch samitiyaan banaai thim
 But no senior officer ever got any punishment
 jedy (you) ke varisht mantri vijay choudhary kehete hai, ''maanjhi sarkaar ne sahi samay par karrwai kii
 The Chief Minister not only conducted the investigation but also removed senior officers
 ab ve afasar jaanch ko prabhavit karne kii haalat main nahin hai
 We will take it to the logical end
 ''maanjhi ne patna ke jila magistrate manish kumaar verma, esaspi manu maharaj, patna diviginal kamishnar en
 The orders for the transfer of Vijayalakshmi and DIG Ajitabh Kumar were issued
 par nai tainaati ke liye chaaron adhikariyon ko pratiksha suchi main rakh diya gaya he
 On October 7, Manjhi called the Superintendent of PMCH, Dr
 lakhindra prasad ko bhi kartavya main kotahi baratane ke aarope main nilambit kar diya
 On the evening of October 5, when Manjhi went to PMCH to meet the victims for the second time after the accident, Prasad was not present there
 maanjhi ne usee samay unki gaiyr-maujuudagi par kadi aapatti darj kii or unhen nilambit kar diya
 Prasad was severely criticized for his delayed arrival at the hospital on the day of the accident
 us badakismat shaam ghayal log 7 baje se hi piemasiech pahunchane lage the
 But Dr
 prasad saadhe teen ghante baad raat 10
 Arrived at 30
 haadase ke do din baad piemasiech kaa daura karne par maanjhi ko or bhi kai gambhir gadbaditaan najar ain
 The Chief Minister found that some more doctors were also not on duty
 vibhinn vaardon ke unit incharge aise chaar doctoron kaa tabadalaa kar diya gaya he, jabaki teen doctoron ko unki galatiyon ke kaaran bataane ko kaha gaya he
 Independent thinker Shaibal Gupta also considers the government's decision to remove the officers as 'very prompt action' after 'tremendous failure of district administration'
 unhone india today se kaha, ''itani vishaal bheed ko ekatra hone kii ijaajat dene se pehle nirdhaarit upayon kaa prashikshan diya jaataa he ki kya karnaa he or kya nahin karnaa he
 Obviously, the necessary steps were not taken
 '' rajya sarkaar ne haadase kii jaanch ke liye ek team kaa gathan kiya he jisamen grih vibhaag ke pramukh sachiv amir subhaani or atirikt mahanideshak (mukhyalay) gupteshwar pandeya ko rakhaa gaya he
 There is no doubt about Manjhi's intentions
 ek varisht iees kehete hai, ''naukarshah ab bhi purv mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii nirvivaad satta or prabhutv ke abhyast hai, na ki maanjhi ke
 Manjhi is still considered a caretaker Chief Minister
 '' vahiin bijepi netaa susheel kumaar modi kehete hai, ''june, 2013 main nitish kumaar ke bijepi se naata todate hi bihar kaa patan shuru ho gaya tha
 With the removal of the majority's security, Nitish got the support of the independent members and all his attention shifted from good governance till his government was retained in some way or the other
 ''loksabhaa chunaav main nitish kii paraajay ke baad halaat or bighad gaye
 After resigning himself from the post of Chief Minister and making Manjhi his successor, it is understood that Nitish would have been expected to run the JD (U) from the back
 lekin party main aantarik vidroh ke chalate ve majdhaar main funs gaye
 Nitish kept distance from RJD chief Lalu Yadav despite JD (U) leader Sharad Yadav's constant emphasis on the unity of secular forces
 lekin maanjhi sarkaar kaa astitv surakshit karne ke liye ve aakhirkaar lalu se haath milaane ko taiyaar ho gaye
 Although RJD helped him overcome the crisis of majority, but Nitish's position has become weak today
 aise main tajubb kya ki nitish se apni takat hasil karne vaale maanjhi bhi ekadam bhurabhuri jameen par khadey hai
 "there is no official remote control," says an IAS officer
 lalu or nitish donon ek duusare ke sampark main hai
 It is believed that both the bureaucrat and the minister keep in touch with Lalu and Nitish and seek guidance from both of them
 kyon na ho? aakhir donon ko super chif ministar ke taur par project kiya jaataa he
 In such a situation, ministers and officers have also stopped taking Manjhi seriously
 ''verma or anya varisht adhikariyon ko boria-bistar sametane kaa hukum sunaakar maanjhi ne apni satta kaa durlabh ehsaas karavaaya he
 But even though Manjhi has some scope to decide about the bureaucrats, the matter of ministers does not seem to have any weight
 june main unhen mahachandra prasad singh ko apane mantrimandal main shaamil karnaa padaa tha
 a charge sheet has been filed against Mahachandra in a murder case and he is facing trial in Saran court
 isi tarah agast main jab samastipur police ne pashu or machhlee paalan mantri baidhnath sahani ke khilaaf exiar darj kii to maanjhi ne unke khilaaf 'kadi karrwai' kaa vaada kiya tha
 While Sahani was allegedly trying to occupy a disputed land with his supporters, he had a confrontation with the villagers
 ve nitish kumaar ke aashirwad se maanjhi ke mantrimandal kii shobhaa badha rahe hai
 The view of October 5 after the shameless bureaucratic tragedy was also amazing
 dekhe bagaiyr is par vishwaas kar paanaa mushkil tha
 DM Manish Kumar Verma's face was glowing with a brilliant smile
 jis bhagdad main 33 log apni jaan se haath dho baithe, usamen khud ko sambhalakar ek nanhe bachche kii jaan bachaane vaali mahila kiran devi ko 25,000 ru
 Varma's face was spreading like a laugh while handing over a check

 jabaki do din pehle hi haadase ke din verma par apni praathmik jimmedaari ko taak par dhar apane bachche kii janmdin party main shaamil hone kaa aarope laga tha
 And after the accident, when he came in front of the media for a while, he claimed in a very militant manner that he had done all that is expected of him as a District Magistrate
 haalanki unhone na to is baat se inkaar kiya or na hi isaki tasdik kii ki haadase kii shaam 6
 Whether the stampede was present at 30 pm or not
 verma ne baar-baar 'dam ghutane' ko haadase kii vajah bataate hue uske mahatv ko 'kam karke bataane' kii bhi koshish kii
 According to him, the accident happened because huge crowds gathered to watch Ravana slaughter, which was much higher than last year

 He is facing all-round criticism for 'tackling the situation in a rude manner' at Gandhi Maidan

 When Interpol issued a Red Corner notice, he says that Interpol has become a political toy
 pesh hadolkan isaase khaas baatcheet kaa pehla bhaag
 
 
 Question- India canceled after giving you the visa
 isaki kya vajah bataai gai
 Have you tried again? Dokkan Isa - It is unfortunate that the Indian government canceled my visa without giving any specific reason
 iske baad maine dobaaraa applai nahin kiya he
 India is a democratic country
 duniya kaa sabase bada loktantr he
 Therefore, it is the responsibility of India to speak clearly on the oppression of people like Uygar and Tibetan
 bharat ko asia main loktantr kaa model bananaa chahie
 Question- Was the visa canceled under pressure from China? If so, what kind of pressure can be put on India? Dokkan Isa - certainly under pressure from China, India refused to grant visas to me and other activists like me on suspicion
 ham jaanate hai ki china bharat ke pados main ek pramukh aarthik shakti he
 But for India to maintain peace with China, it is necessary to maintain a balance between the two positions while supporting the rights of other social and human rights activists
 bharat ko china jaise deshon ke dabaav main jhuke bina uigar or tibeti samudaay kii madad kerani chahie
 Question- What do you think about India? How do you see it as a country? What are your expectations from India? Dolcan Isa - We all know that India is the largest democratic country on the planet by population
 haalanki, bharat ko kuch kshetron main garibi jaise vyapak muddon se saamana karnaa pad rahaa he, lekin dhire-dhire sthiti main badlaav bhi ho rahaa he
 India has emerged as a big nation, capable of making changes for democracy
 yahi baat china ke bare main bhi kahi ja sakati he
 i wanted to come to India, but could not come due to the cancellation of the visa
 main ummid karata hum ki main bhavishya membharat kii yatrajrur karuunga
 i hope that the people of Uygar will be able to maintain good relations with the Government of India and the people here
 sawaal- aapaki tulana aatanki ajahar masood se kii gai
 What is the reaction to this? Do you consider him a terrorist? Dolcan Isa - i have worked mainly for human rights
 lekin mere dwaara uigar samudaay kaa samarthan karne kii vajah se chini sarkaar ne mujhe aatankwaadi tehra diya
 China often tries to peacefully engage human rights activists with terrorists
 9 / 11 kii ghatana ke baad se china 'aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang' ke naam par purvi turkistan main nirdosho kaa daman kar rahaa he
 Along with this, the Uygar is trying to show the community violently in front of the international community
 main pakistani aatanki masood ajahar ke saath kisi tarah kii tulana ko khaarij karata hum, jiske liye china ne sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main apana vito lagaaya

 The army's attack on terrorists in pok has now taken political color
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne narendra modi sarkaar se sargical hamale ke saboot mangakar puure maamle ko nayaa mode de diya
 Kejriwal's support and opposition on social media sparked fierce debate and government minister Ravi Shankar Prasad targeted Kejriwal from the BJP platform
 ravi shankar ne kaha ki saboot kii baat kahkar kejariwal ne sena ke manobal ko thes pahunchaai he or iske liye pakistan main unhen surkhiyaan mili he
 Kejriwal should have spoken on this issue in one voice rather than politics
 bijepi ke jawaab par aam aadmi party ne ye kahkar palatwaar kiya ki sarkaar or party sargical strike kaa istemaal vot ke liye kar rahi he poster chhapavakar publicity kar rahi he or raksha mantri desh bhar main jaakar vaahvahee lut rahe hai jo sawaal khadey karata he
 The government advised the ministers to remain silent, after the operation in the army's pok, many ministers at the center had made a strong statement against Pakistan and in favor of Modi
 lekin jaise hi mudde par raajnneeti garmaane lagi in mantriyon ko chup rahane kii hidaayat de di gai
 Now only that minister comes forward and puts forward the government or party whose duty is being officially imposed
 kejariwal or congress ke aaropo kaa jawaab dene ke liye mangalvaar ko ravi shankar prasad ko adhikrut kiya gaya or unke alaava kisi or mantri ne muh nahin kholaa
 It is clear that the restraint of big ministers has been tightened on sensitive issues

 kendriya satarkta ayog (CVC) ke gambhir aaropon ke baad se vivaadon main ghire alok verma ko aakhirkaar kendriya jaanch beuro ke diarector pad se hataa diya gaya he
 The CVC in its report has made serious allegations of corruption on Alok Verma
 saath hi sibiai ke record nikaalkar alok verma ke khilaaf fouran jaanch karne kii bhi baat kahi
 The CVC alleged in its report that Satish Babu Sana bribed Alok Verma of Rs 2 crore to stop the investigation into the case of Moin Qureshi and others
 alok verma ne sibiai kii jaanch se IRCTC maamle ke mukhya aaropee rakesh saxena ko bachaane kii koshish kii
 Apart from this, while holding the post of CBI Director, Alok Verma had also issued a directive not to carry out search operations at the bases of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav
 sivisi ne maamalon ko gambhir maanate hue alok verma ko teen baar notice bheja or dastavejon ko pesh karne ko kaha
 However, the CBI appealed to extend the date for presenting the documents
 iske baad sivisi ne maamle kii taarikh 14 sitambar 2018 se taalkar 18 sitambar 2018 kar di thi
 Let us know what the CVC said in its 23 point report
 1
 Alok Verma was accused of taking a bribe of Rs 2 crore from Satish Babu Sana in the Moin Qureshi case
 2
 Alok Verma was accused in the IRCTC case of issuing instructions to the CBI joint director not to conduct searches in Lalu Prasad Yadav's premises
 sibiai nideshak par sibiai ko chalaane main aise hi kuch or gambhir aaropon kii baat kahi gai thi
 3
 nideshak ko in aaropon ke sambandh main 14 sitambar 2018 ko kamishan ke saamne jaruri file or dastavej pesh karne ko 3 notice jari kiye gaye the
 4
 sibiai kii ore se is maamle main or samay dene kaa anurodh kiya gaya, jisase sunwaayee ko 18 sitambar 2018 tak ke liye taal diya gaya
 5
 sibiai ne 18 sitambar ko rakesh asthana ke sambandh main kamishan ko likhi chitthee main kaha tha ki sambandhit adhikari par cese main lage aarope sach prathit hote hai
 Evidence of criminal misconduct was found in more than half a dozen cases against him
 adhikari ko sibiai ke paas apane khilaaf saboot hone kii bhi jaankaree thi
 The CBI had said that Rakesh Asthana's complaint should not be taken seriously as it is an attempt by a tainted officer to threaten other officers of the CBI
 sibiai ne kaha tha ki vah kamishan ko jaruri file uplabdh karaane ko bhi taiyaar hai
 Also, the identity of the complainant was also asked by the CBI
 6
 In the context of cbi's September 18 letter, the commission refused to reveal the identity of the complainant
 iske baad kamishan ne sibiai diarector ko apane teen puraane notice ko doharaaya or sabhi dastavej or file 20 sitambar tak pesh karne ko kaha
 7
 sibiai ne 19 sitambar ko chitthee likhakar kamishan se kaha ki moin kuraishi cese ke dastavej vibhinn shakhaon se jamaa kiye ja rahe hai
 The commission asked the CBI to submit an original notch file and record of the case by 24 September
 8
 The CBI wrote in its letter on September 24 that the records are in thousands of pages, the files are in places like Malkhana, Court etc
 inhen pesh karne ke liye teen hafte chahie
 The commission said that these should be introduced as early as possible
 haalanki, sibiai headquarter main maujuud noteshit file ko 28 sitambar tak pesh karne ko kaha
 09
 kamishan ne 9 oktober ko sibiai kii chitthee ke aadhaar par kaha ki sibiai se shikaayat ke sambandh main filein maange hue ek maheene kaa samay ho gaya he
 The commission admitted that the CBI file was not a public property, but it could be viewed by the competent authority
 kamishan ne phir se sibiai nideshak ko jaruri jaanch main madad dene kii salaah di or 22 oktober tak dastavej dikhaane ko kaha, lekin 23 oktober tak na to dastavej die gaye or na hi samay seemaa badhaane kaa anurodh kiya gaya
 10
 is dauraan sibiai ke vishesh nideshak rakesh asthana ne kai baar alok verma par maukhik or likhit aarope lagaae or kaha ki unke dwaara lagaae gaye 6 aaropon kii jaanch se alok verma or eke sharma ko alag kiya jaae
 The commission then stated on September 25 that the commission had not found evidence against any CBI officer, but should maintain impartiality in the investigation
 11
 On September 25, another letter was sent to the CBI director and it was said that several reminders were sent about the information sought by the commission, but even after 10 months no action has been taken
 is bare main hui aatanrik report kaa nateeja 3 oktober tak bataane ko kaha gaya
 12
 3 oktober tak koi jawaab nahin milane par sibiai nideshak se sivisi se 4 oktober ko rakesh asthana ke pratinidhitiv ke sandarbh main mulaakaat karne ko kaha gaya
 The CBI Director did not attend it
 13
 On 15 October, another letter was sent to the CBI Director
 isamen sibiai ke kisi bhi adhikari ke khilaaf jaanch se pehle aavashyak anumati lene ko kaha gaya
 The CBI director was again asked to provide the necessary documents
 14
 During this, it was learned that on 15 October CBI registered a case on the complaint of Hyderabad's Satish Babu Sana, who is an accused in the case being investigated by the Special Director of CBI
 is bare main vishesh nideshak kaa daawa he ki unhone isaki giraftaar kii ijaajat maangi thi, jo ki sibiai nideshak se nahin mili
 Rakesh appeared before the Asthana Commission on October 12, 18, 19 and 20
 20 oktober ko nideshak ko sibiai ke dspi devinder kumaar ne chitthee likhi ki satish babu se unke sampark ke jhuthe aaropon main unke ghar kii talaashi lee ja rahi he, jabaki unhone pehle hi satish kii giraftaar or poochtacha karne kii apil kii thi, jise aaj tak manjuuri nahin mili
 He said that he is being made a scapegoat
 kamishan ko yah chitthee 22 oktober ko mili
 15
 22 oktober ko sibiai kii SIT ke sanyukt nideshak sai manohar ne kamishan ko rakesh asthana ke record ke hawaale se chitthee likhi ki moin kuraishi cese main sutron ke hawaale se pataa chalaa he ki sibiai nideshak ko 2 karod rupee kii ghoose di gai
 16
 kamishan ne mana ki sibiai nideshak jaanch main madad nahin kar rahe hai or koi file uplabdh nahin karai
 No records were submitted even after asking for three weeks
 17
 The CVC alleged that it had noticed that the CBI did not present records in other cases as well
 18
 The CVC said that the CBI did not cooperate in the investigation of the case
 sivisi ke kaam main jaanboojhkar roda atakaya gaya
 19
 report main kaha gaya ki CVC act ke section 8 (1) (a) sivisi ko sibiai ke kaaryon kii nigaraanee karne kaa adhikaar he
 As far as these allegations of corruption are concerned, the CVC is committed to investigate this under the corruption law
 20
 The CVC said in its report that it was given a complaint by the Cabinet Secretary on 24 August 2018, after which it used its powers to ask the CBI to present a record in the case, but 40 days passed and the record was not presented
 jab sibiai ne record pesh nahin kiya or sahyog nahin kiya, jiske chalate sivisi in gambhir aaropon ke maamalon apane kartavya kaa nirvahan nahin kar paa rahi he
 21
 sibiaike andar jhagada kaaphi bad gaya he, jisase jaanch agency kii garima ko bhi nuksaan hua he
 Reports of corruption by a senior CBI officer against another top official were also widely reported in the media, which also worsened the working environment inside the investigating agency
 iskaa asar sibiai ke duusare adhikariyon par padaa
 22
 dilli special police esteblishment act (DSPE Act) kaa section- 4 (1) sivisi kosibiaiki nigaraanee karne kaa adhikaar detaa he
 Apart from this, section 8 (1) (a) and (b) of the CVC Act also empowers the CVC to superintendence the functions of the CBI
 isko alaava supreme court ne bhi superintendence kii vyakhya kii he
 Cases are registered against Alok Verma under the corruption law and many cases are yet to be investigated
 aise main unako diarector pad kii shaktiyon kaa istemaal nahin karnaa chahie
 23
 sivisine kaha ki sibiai main apatkaal jaise halaat paidaa hone ke kaaran yah report di gai he
 However, before taking a decision based on this report, the principle of natural justice should be followed
 jiesti ko lagu hone main ab 20 din se bhi kam vaqt bachaa he
 In such a situation, the biggest challenge is to connect the traders with the new system
 20 lakh se upar vaali salanaa aamadani vaale vyapaariyon kaa jiesti se judana anivaary he lekin nae tex system kii jaankaree or computer sakshartaa ke abhaav main chote-bade sabhi vyapaaree pareshaan hai
 There are about 60 million small traders in the country
 desh ke baaki rajyon ko agar chhod bhi den to dilli main hi kai chote-bade bazaaron main aise lakhon vyapaaree hai jinako jiesti kii puri jaankaree nahin he
 In such a situation, businessmen believe that before implementing GST, the government should have campaigned to make everyone aware so that all can voluntarily join this step in the right way
 vyapaaree sangh ke adhyaksh praveen khandelwal kaa maananaa he ki chote vyapaariyon ko jodne ke liye unako jaagruk karnaa bahut jaruri he
 These troubles in front of the traders 1
 nae tex system se judi choti-badi jaankaree kaa abhaav
 2
 jiesti ke kaaran sabhi bahi khaaton kaa computarikaran, jise zyaadaatar vyapaaree chalaanaa hi nahin jaanate hai
 3
 60 fisadi vyapaariyon ko computer kii jaankaree nahin he
 4
 maheene main 3 baar iskar ritern fil karnaa hoga jo ki pehle 3 maheene main ek baar tha
 5
 local hole cell vyapaario ke liye sabhi product kii jaankaree computer par daalana mumkin nahin he
 6
 jiesti ke tahat lagane vaale tex kii sahi jaankaree nahin he
 7
 bazaar abhi se hua manda, kharidaar nahin aa rahe hai
 8
 sabhi saamaanon par alag-alag tex bhi pareshaani badha rahaa he
 9
 transction fil karte samay hui galati ke chalate unako jurmaana bharna hoga
 10
 jiesti lagu hote hi bazaaro par padane vaale asar se vyapaaree dare hue hai
 Keeping in mind the long-term consequences of GST, it is essential that all join it
 jiske liye yah bhi jaruri he ki shuruyaat main sabhi chote-bade vyapaario ko vaqt diya jaae taaki vah is nai tex pranali ko samaj kar iskaa hissaa ban saken

 This time, where the Congress is trying to return to its old stronghold with the help of CM Virbhadra Singh, the challenge before BJP is to retain its seat

 It should also be investigated whether they were kept in jail or kept open after the day was over
 agar jail main band kar diya gaya tha, to phir log kaise baahar nikle or bhaagane main kaamyaab hue
 The big question is why these terrorists were kept in the same cell

 jiske tahat kareeb ek chauthai hissaa yani takreeban 25 lakh rupee sirf jiesti ke tahat chalaa jaataa he or isi mudde ko lekar parshado main jabardast rosh he

 unka kahana he ki ye fund he jo vikaas kaaryon ke liye miltaa he lekin is parjiastilgane se parshadon ko milane vaale fund main kareeb ek chauthai kii katautee ho gai he
 The councilors have demanded that after GST, they should now get a quarter increase in their funds so that it does not affect the fund for development work

 ) (this news has not been edited by the NDTV team
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) bajet2018 yakeenan modi kaa khaas avasar tha
 There is no scope for any doubt in this
 unhone vah sab sirf kiya hi nahin, balki aashwast kiya ki yah sabhi jaan len
 Immediately after the Union Budget was presented in Parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached the TV with a pen in one hand and a notepad in the other and kept counting his key points for a good 25 minutes with great fervor
 modi ke jehan main yah baat thi ki unki sarkaar kaa yah aakhri purna bajet he
 Every word of his is giving this message to the voters of the country, i am your chief servant, i care about you, i care about the country, i have come to remove your problem, i am thinking of the next generation, not the next general election
 
 modi ne kaha ki bajet main pesh yojanaon se desh main rojgaar kii apaar sambhaavnaaen banengi
 Narendra Modi has already demonstrated the ability to give big thinking, big slogans
 unka ab sabase nayaa naaraa he 2022 tak ''new india", ''saamaajik or aarthik loktantr" kii bahaali or ''jivan kii sahuuliyat" main ijapha
 They also have great potential to take risks
 chaahe pakistan ke khilaaf sargical strike karnaa ho, yaa kaale dhan ke khilaaf notebandi kii muhim, yaa maal or seva kar (jiesti) par amal, har maamle main modi ne dikhaaya he ki chaahe jo keemat adaa kerani pade, ve acshan chaahate hai
 They will not hesitate to move forward
 notebandi siyaasi kamyaabi to lekar ai magar arthvyavastha ko gud-gobar kar gai
 GST economy was needed but also due to political crisis
 ek ke baad ek in do aarthik jhatkon se desh kii vruddhi ghota lagane lagi to narendra modi kii aparaajey chhavi bhi darkane lagi
 But the Prime Minister showed that he is always ready to stand on the front, learning from mistakes and ready to improve immediately
 phir, bajet 2018 ne to saaf taur par jaahir bhi kar diya ki arthvyavastha or raajnneeti kii visangatiyon or virodhabhaason ko sambhalate hue bhi unamem bade jokhim uthaane kaa madda barkaraar he
 The economic imperatives for the budget were clear: there is a need to create jobs and jobs for the youth and growing unemployed people of the country
 krishi kshetra ko baari badahaali se ubaarane or paidaavaar badhaane tathaa sambhaavnaaen jagaane kii jarurat he
 Prominent reforms were needed in key social sectors such as health and education to create a healthy and healthy workforce
 agar modi satta dilaane vaale ''achche din" ke vaade ko nibhaana chaahate hon to nijee kshetra ke nivesh or niryaat ko badhaava dekar aarthik vruddhi kii dar tej karne ke upaay apnaane the
 And all this had to be done so that no one would say what one consultant described as "yarana Socialism" or "stained Capitalism"
 siyaasi majaburiyaan to or bhi joardaar or fori thim
 India Today and other recent opinion polls showed that Modi's personal popularity is high, but his government's image has started to dive slowly, especially on the economic front
 agar bhartiya janata party ko agle aam chunaav main apana bahumat banaae rakhana he to aabaadi ke bade tabake kaa dil jeetna hi hoga
 Especially angry peasants and agricultural laborers have to be appeased, which is the largest workforce and the electorate
 modi ko aabaadi ke duusare tabakon yuva, mahila, adivasee, dalit or chote kaarobaariyon ke bich bhi apane prati sahanubhuti jagaae rakhane kii darkaar thi, jinka vot sankhya main ahm yogadan hota he
 While doing all this, he also had to prove that he has the ability to make Hindutva India come true for the Sangh Parivar
 modi ke paas koi aadhe-adhure upaay nahin hai
 They want to appear brave, fearless and uninterested in everything they do but it can also be annoying for a lot of people
 isliye bajet 2018 saahasik he kyonki modi ne vibhinn fasalon ke nunatam samarthan mulya main dedh guna ijaphe kaa vaada karke kisaanon ko lubhaane main koi kasar nahin chodi he
 His team has left a lot of money to make much-needed agricultural reforms possible by increasing infrastructure especially for food processing and horticulture
 yah isliye bhi dussahan kaa kaam tha kyonki in kadamon se mahangaai bad sakati he jisase paidaa hone vaale jaakhim ko pradhanmantri uthaane ko taiyaar hai
 Also because they are willing to face the displeasure of big industrial houses by not reducing the corporate tax and bringing capital gains tax for long term investment
 saath hi unhone prabhavi madhyavarg ke liye bhi kisi tarah kii koi riyaayat nahin di
 The budget is realistic because the world's largest health insurance scheme "ayushman Bharat" was introduced in it
 is yojana ke tahat sarkaar kareeb 10 karod jaruratmand pariwaron ke liye 5 lakh ru
 Will bear annual medical expenses of up to Rs
 10 karod pariwaron ko raahat dene ke peeche sarkaar kaa makasad un pariwaron ke 50 karod sadasyon tak pahunchane kaa he
 Not taking very popular decisions for the middle class, the central government has made it clear that its focus is on a large section of the electorate, which is slightly less than half of the country's population
 magar yah chintajanak bhi he kyonki isse modi kii chhavi ke loklubhaavan sudhaarak kii banane kaa khatra he
 The untoward that is expected is the rise in the prices of petroleum products
 modi sarkaar ke shuruaati teen saal ke dauraan kachche tel kii girti keemton ne unhen kai infrastracchar or kalyaan yojanaon main rakam lagane or rajkoshiya santulan banaae rakhane kii mohalat di
 But if oil prices continue to rise, their plans to bail out the poor and farmers may not be affected by the lack of revenue, but there is also the danger of inflation being uncontrollable with interest rates rising
 philhal kachche tel kii keemten ek str par tiki hui hai
 Modi is relying on his government's heavy investment in infrastructure, especially in the transport and housing sectors, to accelerate economic growth by increasing employment and private investment
 magar dohari balance-shit jaisi kai chunautiyaan aade aa sakati hai
 This means that many corporate houses are heavily in debt and banks are heavily burdened with bad debts or non-performing assets (npas)
 in par tavajjo di gai he lekin halaat sahaj hone main kuch vakt lag saktaa he
 Along with this, the additional risk is that even the big schemes announced in this budget can be difficult for the government
 lihaaja, baari naaraazgi uth khadi ho sakati he or unke dobaaraa chunaav jeetne kii sambhaavnaaon main send lag sakati he
 The risk is therefore enormous and its rewards too vigorous, but, as it is said, the future favors the brave
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki bajet 2018 main modi ne vah kaabiliyat bekhauf dikhaai he
 *** balbrahmcharee hanuman shaadi kaa vardaan dete hai, lekin lekin iske liye bhakton ko 5 mangalvaar kii aradhana kerani hoti he
 Devotees worshiping Mudrika Hanuman present in Jhansi gets the boon of early marriage
 anya mandiron kii tarah yahaan bhi dhol, manjiron se hanuman ji kaa gungan hota he or bajrangbali kii aarti utarkar maangi jaati he manokamana
 With both hands folded, the devotees close their eyes and remember their meaning, and then they automatically bow down at the feet of Bajrangbali
 ye mahima hai jhaansi ke kuch hi duuri bar based baba hanuman kii, jahaan dharti par surya kii pehali kiran padati nahin he ki bhakton kii baari bheed umad padati he
 Although anyone can come here to see Lord, but the number of women and girls is the highest among the devotees who come here
 aisa mana jaataa he ki hanuman ji apane mandir main aanevaali har mahila bhakt ko apni maa ke rup main dekhte hai
 After all, the story of Mudrika Dhari Hanuman is also related to mother Sita
 yahaan par haath main mudrika dhaaran kiye hanuman ji kii murti us samay kii yaad dilaati he, jab bhagwaan ram ke aadesh par wo mudrika lekar mata-sita kii khoj karne nikle or apane prabhu se nishaani ke rup main unki mudrika lee
 When Hanuman ji reached Mata Sita's Ashoka Vatika in search of Mother Sita, after seeing his suffering there, his body was shivering, his hand went to his chest on his own and a sigh came out of his mouth
 kehete hai ki jhaansi kaa ye mandir hanuman ji ke usee rup ko darshata he
 No one is allowed to touch the idol of Hanuman here
 mandir ke chaaron ore aath khidki or chaar daravaaje hai, jinase hanuman ji ke darshan kiye ja sakate hai
 Therefore they are also called distant babas
 bhale hi bhakton ko hanuman ji ke charan chune kaa sukh nahin miltaa ho, lekin sachche man se kii gai aradhana unhen bajrangbali kaa vardaan jarur dilaati he
 Pawanputra definitely blesses happiness as well as life partner and children
 jo bhi bhakt mahila is mandir main aati he bhagwaan unki manokamana jarur puri karte hai
 Devotees get the blessing of life partner by coming here on Tuesday
 tabhi to bhakt kam se kam paanch mangalvaar yahaan jarur aate hai
 Devotees here worship God with full devotion and devotion by offering gram, cardamom seeds and never forget to come here when the wish is fulfilled
 khaane main agar namak kii maatra zyada ho jaae to khaane kaa puraa swaad kharaab ho jaataa he
 In the same way, if excessive amount of salt starts going into the body, it can harm health in many ways
 adhik maatra main namak kaa seven karne se sharir main calories badhati hai jo cancer ke jokhim ko badhaane kaa kaam karti hai
 Apart from this, these four disadvantages to health are due to eating more salt

 If there is less salt in the food at any time, then put it in the food separately and avoid consuming it
 3
 Dehydration problem: Excess salt content in the body can cause sedimentation problem

 4

 This condition is called water retention or fluid retention

 Yes
 
 
 
 # Metoo
 
 
 
 
 Sharing a post like this and joining the global awareness on sexual assaults on women all over the world and showing solidarity to each and every woman who sailed on the same boat , shows the magnitude of the problem
 m surprised that some 'good' men are shocked to see the number of women who have come out and shared their # metoo experiences
 NO DON'T BE
 This is happening in your own backyard, in your own house, with your own sister, daughter, mother, wife or even your maid
 
 
 Gain their trusts and ask them
 You will be surprised at their answers
 
 You will be surprised with their stories
 
 Writing something like this brings me to tears reliving those memories as a little girl when i was scared of the neighborhood uncle and his prying eyes who at any given opportunity would grope me and threaten me not to speak about this to anyone
 
 
 
 
 OR my much older cousins who would eye me differently than their own daughters 
 
 
 
 OR the man who saw me at the hospital when i was born and 13 years later he thought it's appropriate for him to touch my body because i was a growing teenager and my body had changed
 
 
 
 OR my tuition teacher who had his hands in my underpants 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 OR this another teacher, whom i tied Rakhi to, would scold the female students in the class by pulling their bra straps and slapping on their breasts
 
 
 
 
 OR that man in the train station who gropes u 
 
 
 Why ?? Because you're too young and scared to speak up
 So scared that you can feel your stomach getting twisted inside and throat getting choked up 
 
 
 you don't know how are you going to explain it to your parents or you're too shy to utter a word to anyone
 
 
 
 And then you start developing that deep rooted hatred towards men
 
 
 Because you know they're the culprit who made you feel this way
 
 That disgusting, twisted feeling inside which takes years to overcome 
 
 
 
 m happy to be another voice joining this movement and make people realise that i was not spared either
 But TODAY i will rip apart any man who even remotely tries anything on me
 i AM PROUD OF WHO i AM

 com a woman was attacked by two men on Sunday night near Dhaula Kuan in Delhi
 mahila kaa aarope he ki us par badmaashon ne paanch roundgolichalaai
 The police are involved in the investigation of the matter
 mahila ke anusaar ravivaar ke din wo gurudwara gai thi or raat main apni car se akele hi waapas laut rahi thi
 When she reached Berar Square near Dhaula Kuan, a man sitting on the scooty signaled her to stop
 mahila kaa kahana he ki use laga ki uski car pankchar ho gai he, ye dikhne ke liye usne gaadi kinare laga lee
 Then Scooty also stopped there and the person sitting behind came near his car and started abusing him loudly
 jiske baad mahila ghabara gai or car le jane kii koshish kii
 He targeted the woman and opened fire
 lekin usne car peeche kar lee is vajah se batch gai
 Even after that, the man fired four more bullets at the woman's car, meanwhile, when the people ran towards the spot after hearing the sound of bullets, the miscreant immediately escaped from Scooty
 haalanki dono badmaashon ne helmet pahan rakhaa tha lihaaja unki pahchaan nahin kar pai
 But the woman claims that the person who fired at them can recognize her when she comes in front
 peedit mahila ne bataaya ki pichley 4 april ko unhone ek shaks par rape, dhokhadhadi or blakemeling kaa cese darj karaayaa tha
 They suspect that those people may be involved in this attack
 mahila ne bataaya ki badmaash jab gaali de rahaa tha, to wo lagaataar kah rahaa tha cese waapas le lo
 Police has registered a complaint in this case and is investigating the case
 police kaa kahana he mahila ke aaropon kii jaanch kii ja rahi he
 In 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping had planned to include India with the idea of one Belt One Road project
 lihaaja china ne tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh par is pariyojna main shaamil hone ke liye kai baar dabaav banaaya tha
 However, India has been against the china-pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) being built under the One Belt One Road (OBOR) i
e
 New Silk Road project
 tatkaaleen upie sarkaar ne bhi pakistan adhikrut kashmir (pok) se guzarane vaale CPEC pariyojna kaa virodh kiya tha, lekin modi sarkaar ke mukaable manmohan sarkaar kaa rukh naram tha
 This was the reason that China's concern about the OBOR project increased as soon as Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power
 bharat pok main china kii CPEC pariyojna ko apni samprabhutaa kaa ulanghan maanata he
 In February 2014, during Manmohan Singh's tenure as Prime Minister, China said that India is ready to join the One Belt One Road project
 haalanki upie sarkaar kii ore se is par koi pratikriya nahin ai or tatkaaleen piem manmohan singh ne chuppi saadh lee thi
 The biggest reason for this was that Manmohan Singh also saw the strategy of China from the message
 iske baad satta main ai modi sarkaar ne CPEC ko lekar apnakda rukh akhriyaar kar liyaor van belt van road pariona main shaamil hone se inkaar kar diya tha
 On this, China accused Prime Minister Modi of reversing the decision of his predecessor government
 china ke sarkari akhbaar global times ne teen agast 2016 ko prakashit ek lekh main kaha ki jab saal 2013 main china ne van belt van road pariyojna kaa vichaar rakhaa tha, tab tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh or unke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar shivashankar menon ne iskaa samarthan kiya tha
 At the same time there was an interest in this project, but the current PM Modi changed India's position on this issue
 chini akhbaar ne yah bhi aarope madha tha ki modi sarkaar europea deshon ke bhadakaane or apane raajnneetik uddeshy ke liye is aarthik vikaas ke agenda se duuri bana rahi he
 He says that European countries are describing the One Belt One Road project as the Chinese plot to encircle India by the sea of string, which is making India look at China with suspicion
 kya PAK ko alag-thalag ke chakkar main bharat ne nahin liya hissaa?china ke dabaav ke baavjood bharat ne van belt van road summit main hissaa nahin liya, jiske chalate ab yah sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya bharat kaa yah faisla sahi he? kuch visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki bharat ne pakistan ko alag-thalag karne ke chakkar main is summit se duuri bana lee
 They say that India should have sent its diplomats to this summit while learning from Japan, so that India would be able to understand its intention and interest in the economic agenda of China
 inkaa kahana he ki china kii technology kaaphi advance hai
 In such a situation, if India adopts Chinese technology and advances in the field of development, then there is no harm in it
 inkaa kahana he ki is summit main nepal, pakistan, srilanka or myanmar samet bharat ke anya padosi desh hissaa le rahe hai
 In such a situation, India should not cut it off
 bharat ke bina nahin safal hogachinkuch visheshgy yah bhi kah rahe hai ki china bharat ko shaamil kiye bina apni is pariyojna ko anjaam tak nahin pahunchaa paaegaa
 Apart from this, it is also being said that the purpose of this project of China is to increase Chinese dominance
 is pariyojna ke jariye china apane utpaadon kii supplai kar sakegaa, jisasse uski arthvyavastha main teji aegi
 China is also not in the mood to allocate tenders to companies of other countries in this project
 agar ise dabaav main aakar tender dena bhi padaa, to zyaadaatar hissaa chini companiyon ke khate main hi jayega
 European countries participating in the OBOR summit have also raised doubts about this
 iske alaava china bhi is baat ko maanata he ki bharat ko shaamil kiye bina is pariyojna ko anjaam tak pahunchaana mushkil kaam he
 This was the reason why India's absence in the Kivan Belt One Roadsmith was a matter of discussion
 haalanki china yah bhi kah rahaa he ki bharat ke nahin shaamil hone uski pariyojna par koi asar nahin padegaa
 Therefore, he will not pressurize India for this
 sansad ke monsoon satr main pichley do hafte se jari gatirodh ke liye kendriya paryaavaran mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne ravivaar ko congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or party ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ko sidhe taur par jimmedaar tehraaya
 He said that Parliament was unable to run due to the 'obstinate attitude' of the Congress, ruining crores of rupees of taxpayers
 jaavdekar ne indore main bijepi ke pradeshstareey prashikshan kaarykram main hissaa lene ke baad samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'sansad baadhit karne ke liye sonia or rahul gandhi jimmedaar hai
 Disrupting Parliament in this way is a contempt of democracy
 sansad ke na chalane se karadaataaon ke karodon rupee barbaad ho rahe hai
 ' unhone kaha, 'aisa lagata he ki congress pichley loksabhaa chunaavon kii haar se ab tak nahin ubar saki he
 Therefore, it is disrupting Parliament without any reason, while the government is ready to discuss every issue in the House
 ' Javadekar said, 'even when the Congress was in power, she used to run away from the discussion in Parliament and because of that the Parliament was disrupted
 ab congress vipaksh main he
 But still the Parliament is not running because of its obstinate attitude
 yah sthiti desh ke liye ghaatak he
 Comments kendriya mantri ne kaha, 'main ummid karata hum ki sansad ke gatirodh ko khatm karne ke liye somvaar ko bulaai gai sarvadaleey baithak main congress or anya vipakshi dalon kaa samuhik vivek jaagrit hoga or ve shesh monsoon satr main sansad chalane denge
 ' iske alaava, jaavdekar ne bataaya ki bijepi ne rakshabandhan ke aagaamee tyohaar par desh ke har vidhansabha kshetra main 11,000 bhaaiyon kii ore se unki bahanon ko uphaar ke rup main durghatana beemaa policy dilwane kii yojana banaai he
 He said, 'with this scheme of BJP, a large number of women will be brought under the ambit of accident insurance
 ' Javadekar told reporters after taking part in bjp's state-level training program in Indore, 'sonia and Rahul Gandhi are responsible for disrupting Parliament
 is tarah sansad baadhit karnaa loktantr kii avmaananaa he
 Millions of rupees of taxpayers are being wasted due to the absence of Parliament
 ' He said, 'it seems that the Congress has not yet recovered from the defeat of the last Lok Sabha elections
 isliye vah bagaiyr kisi kaaran ke sansad baadhit kar rahi he, jabaki sarkaar sadan main har mudde par charchaa ke liye taiyaar he
 ' jaavdekar ne kaha, 'congress jab satta main thi, tab bhi vah sansad main charchaa se bhaagti thi or uski vajah se sansad baadhit hoti thi
 Now Congress is in opposition
 lekin ab bhi usee ke adiyal ravaiye kii vajah se sansad nahin chal paa rahi he
 This situation is fatal for the country
 'tippaniyan The Union Minister said, "I hope that in the all-party meeting convened on Monday to end the deadlock of Parliament, the collective conscience of Congress and other opposition parties will be awakened and they will allow Parliament to run for the rest of the monsoon session
" ' Apart from this, Javadekar said that the BJP has planned to get accident insurance policy on behalf of 11,000 brothers in every assembly constituency of the country as a gift to their sisters on the upcoming festival of Rakshabandhan
 unhone kaha, 'bijepi kii is yojana se mahilaon ko badi sankhya main durghatana beemaa kii suvidha ke daayre main laayaa ja sakegaa
 ' unhone kaha, 'aisa lagata he ki congress pichley loksabhaa chunaavon kii haar se ab tak nahin ubar saki he
