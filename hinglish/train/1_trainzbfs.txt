 pichley saal ghazal samraat jagajeet singh kii maut sangeet kii duniya kaa ek behad ahm konaa khaali kar gai
 a year later, Sony Music is going to release a new album of eight ghazals of 'master and His Magic' by Jagjit Singh in association with Chitra Singh
 in gajalon ko jagajeet ne assi ke dashak ke dauraan apane live sho main gaaya tha, lekin ye ab tak relies nahin kii gai thim
 Since they were picked up from the recording of live shows, they needed some grooming and fixing
 lihaaja, elbum ke rup main inhen pesh karne se pehle chitra ne jaruri binduon ko dhyaan main rakhkar aawaaj or sur-taal ko sanvaar kar in gajalon ko ek khubasurat rup diya he
 Senior Editor S
 sahay ranjit ko die saakshaatkaar main chitra ne sangeet ke prati jagajeet ke purna samarpan se lekar aaj ke gayakon tak, tamaam vishyon par apni raay rakhi
 You also know: Are the songs that you have chosen from Jagjit Singh's live show something special? a few months ago a friend and fan of ours from Ahmedabad told me that he has a collection of ghazals of Jagjit Singh's live show which is now Has not been released till then and then the collection of songs were handed over to me
 maine suna
 None of them were capable of recording studios
 maine unhen sanvarkar elbum ke kaabil banaaya
 This album is a tribute to Jagjit from me and a gift to his millions of fans
 kya in geeton main jagajeet singh ke saath aap bhi hai?nahin, main is elbum kaa hissaa nahin
 Still you will be able to hear me
 philhal main iske bare main or kuch nahin bataaungi
 You will feel better after listening to this album
 in gaanon ko wasim barelvi, faraaq ruhavi or nnagalib jaise desh ke tamaam bade gajalgo ne kalambaddh kiya or ye nnagajalein aapako jagajeet singh kii jindagi ke alag-alag padaavon se rou-ba-rou karaati hai
 Jagjit Singh passed away for the whole year
 kya aapane is bich kabhi sochaa ki ve kahin upar baithkar bhi ga rahe hai?beshak, mere liye yah behad mushkil samay rahaa he
 I'm not with them
 mujhe kuch jimmedaariyaan nibhaani hai, jinhone mujhe baandh rakhaa he
 i am probably living for this reason
 jagajeet singh ke vyaktitv kii koun-si baat aapako sabase zyada yaad aati he?sangeet ke maamle main ve purnataavaadi the
 He himself inspected each piece, closely inspecting the seating and microphone space
 concert se pehle kabhi reharsal nahin karte the
 But he had expertise in capturing the pulse of the audience
 aap unke geet / ghazal roj sunati hai?unki gajalen meri ragon main basii hai
 Of course i don't listen to them every day but they are with me
 mujhe aaj bhi vah din yaad he jab pehali baar unki aawaaj suni thi
 Then i was a fan of Talat Mehmood
 lihaaja, jagajeet kii aawaaj mujhe acchhee nahin lagi
 But when i started listening to them, i realized that their voice slowly compliments the heart
 shuru main shaayad mere kaanon ko unka sangeet sunne-samajhane kii kaabiliyat nahin thi
 Ghazal has come a long way
 kya aapako lagata he ki aaj ghazal ke naam par jo kuch bhi gaaya ja rahaa he, vah shuddh ghazal kii bajaae gitnuma zyada he?bharat main kai sangeet vishaarad hai jinhone mujic main piechdi kii he, lekin ve ek sur bhi sahi nahin laga sakate
 Do you think Ghazal style has been affected due to the young singers of today? The style of Ghazal singing has changed
 jagajeet ne ghazal ko us mukaam tak pahunchaa diya he ki aaj duniya main har koi ghazal gaanaa chahta he
 People believe that Ghazal singing can give such a great status to Jagjit ji, then they too can do something amazing like this
 jagajeet singh ne duniya ko bataaya ki geet ko kaise kalambaddh karte hai, kaise use aawaaj main dhaalte hai or kaise geet ke bolon main arth bharte hai
 Who understands these nuances today? Jagjit Singh's singing had a unique combination of Riyaz, sobriety and passion, which is not present in today's generation

 Congratulations to captain @chetri_sunil11 & Sonam Chhetri! a post shared by Football Xperts (@footballxperts) on Nov 20, 2017 at 8:51am pstto the love of my life, a friend, critic and my guide
 Thank you so much for 13 years of memories made and heres to many more to come! a post shared by chetri_sunil11 (@ chetri_sunil11) on Jun 11, 2017 at 4:13 am PDT china ke raashtrapati shi jinping kii pakistan yatra shaayad isliye tal rahi thi kyonki donon mulk jis karavat kii taiyaari kar rahe the, vah yakeenan bahut badi hone vaali thi
 Before handing over its economic future to Pakistan, China had to muster up the courage to distance itself from the US, while China had to overcome the strategy of meddling in the world's most risky country
 sab kuch yojana ke mutabik hua or jinping or navaj sharif ke bich samjhaute ke saath hi dakshin asia kii kootnithik bisaat sire se badal gai
 India could not stop wanting this change
 america ne rokane main ruchi nahin lee jabaki haashiye par simate rus ko zyada matlab nahin tha
 With the sino-pak agreement, not only will a new Pakistan confront India but the government of Delhi will have to be ready for a blast of Chinese companies from Kashgar to Gwadar including Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, a few hundred kilometers from the country's border
 46 arab dollar kitne hote hai? agar yah sawaal pakistan se sambandhit ho to jawaab he ki yah aankada pakistan ke jidipi ke 20 fisadi hisse ke baraabar he
 This is the investment whose agreement has been signed by Jinping and Nawaz Sharif
 samajhnaa mushkil nahin he ki china ne pakistan kii dub chuki arthvyavastha ko na keval god main uthaa liya he balki yah nivesh jis project main ho rahaa he, uske tahat lagbhag puraa pakistan china ke prabhaav main hoga
 Their noise will be knocked on to Delhi when the Chinese state-run Three Gorges Corporation, the world's largest hydropower project maker and the one with $ 60 billion in assets, starts a major economic and construction project in the history of Pakistan
 china-pakistan aarthik coridor apane tarah kii pehali pariyojna he jisamen do mulk apni aarthik samprabhutaa ko saajha kar rahe hai
 The 3,000-kilometer corridor connecting the northwestern Chinese city of Kashgar on the Karakoram highway to Pakistan's southern port of Gwadar will form a network of roads, railways, oil-gas pipelines, industrial parks, including Pakistan-occupied Kashmir
 guadar ko honkong kii tarj par free trade jone main badla jayega
 The metros are also part of the corridor in Lahore, Multan, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi and Karachi
 china ne apni paanch diggaj sarkari companiyon, thri gorges, china power international, huaneng group, isibisi corp, jonerjee corp ko pakistan main utaar diya he
 Behind them will be the strength of the resources of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China
 iran-pakistan ke bich banane vaali gas pipeline ko bhi china kii saraparasti mil gai he
 Its 560-mile-long Iranian side (from Asaluya in the Persian Gulf to the Baluchistan border) is ready, now Pakistan has to lay a 485-mile pipeline to Gwadar
 kareeb do arab dollar kii is pariyojna kii 85 fisad laagat china uthayega
 This pipeline will provide 4,500 MW of power capacity to Pakistan which will eliminate the power shortage of the entire country
 desh ke aarthik va ranneetik bhavishya ko china ko saunpane kaa faisla yakeenan bada tha lekin sharif ko isamen bahut mushkil nahin hui hogi kyonki america ne 60 varsh ke rishton main pakistan kii arthvyavastha ko itani badi saugat nahin di jo china ne ek baar main de di
 Sharif has achieved a lot by combining the fortunes of Pakistan with China
 pakistani arthvyavastha lagbhag dub chuki he
 Investment is absent and foreign aid is also gone
 china pariyojnaon ke tej kriyanvayan ke liye mashhoor he
 The entire corridor is to be ready in the next 15 years, while the china-iran pipeline will start functioning from 2017
 agar sab kuch thik chalaa to agle kuch maheenon main pakistan main tej nirmaan shuru ho jayega jo arthvyavastha ko gati dene ke saath sharif kii siyaasi musiibat kam karegaa
 Friendship with China can also help Sharif reduce military dominance and limit terrorist activities
 china ke yuan agle paanch saal main pakistan kaa cheharaa badal sakate hai
 China could only afford to invest such a huge investment in a factory of terror, a risky country with unstable governments and military secrets, and Jinping was keen to do so, according to experts
 afghanistan, iran va pashchim asia ke khanij samrudh ilaake china kii aarthik mahatvakankshaon kaa nayaa lakshya hai or jahaan america va rus kii ruchi khatm ho rahi he
 This investment in Pakistan will limit India's strategy in South Asia and will allow China free flight from Afghanistan to West Asia
 iske alaava pakistan china ke liye saste utpaadan kaa centre banegaa or iran ke gas va tel china tak laane kaa rasta bhi taiyaar karegaa
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's diplomatic resolve is commendable, but even before the results of his global flights came out, China and Pakistan have changed the diplomatic equations of the Indian subcontinent
 bharat ke liye dakshin asia kii kootneeti main sharten tay karne ke zyada vikalp nahin bache hai
 After cherishing the economic interests of Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Bangladesh, China has also taken Pakistan into the palm
 modi ko agle maah beijing jane se pehle yah tay karnaa hoga ki bharat is nae chinis dream ke saath kaise saamanjasy sthapit karegaa
 Xi Jinping's idiomatic language is not new in the world of diplomacy, yet this time when he called Pakistan the future Asian tiger (his article featured in Pakistan's Daily Times), it was no less surprising because no superpower in the world Never seen this possibility
 china kii dosti main pakistan sher banegaa yaa nahin, yah kahana mushkil he lekin is baat se ittefaq karnaa hoga ki chini diene ke saath pakistan kii gurraahat or chaal jarur badal jaaegi

 The electoral complexion on BJP has increased
 lekin dilli kii taraf teji se kadam badhaate modi par thodaa brake bhi laga he
 In such a situation, there was no consensus on Modi's campaign committee, but it became clear that now about a dozen committees will be formed which will look at all aspects related to election campaign
 sansadeey board kii baithak to hui lekin ye bhi saaf ho gaya ki modi ko ab sabko saath lekar chalanaa hoga
 About a dozen committees will be announced, which will be formally announced on Friday
 is sansadeey board main baithne kii jagah to badal gayi he lekin is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki yug badal gaya he
 Nobody is listening to Advani and the Delhi quartet is forced to bow down to Modi
 lekin sachai to ye bhi he ki sangh ne modi ko saaf kar diya tha ki sabko saath lekar chalanaa he taaki ladaai bijepi banaam congress rahe na ki modi banaam congress
 Apparently in the meeting of the Parliamentary Board in the midst of this meeting, it was decided that under the publicity committee
 
 
 - kareeb ek darjan upasmitiyaan bane jisamen chunavi ghoshnaptr, prachaar or chunaav sanchaalan jesi samitiyaan bane
 - Party general secretaries and senior leaders will be given responsibility
 - bijepi ko lagata he ki congress modi par hallaa bole yaa phir nazarandaaj kare, phayda modi ko hi hoga
 - Advani, Sushma, Rajnath will not be members of any committee
 baithak kareeb do ghante chali
 Now that the core group has been abolished, only the parliamentary board has started functioning as a core group
 isliye baithken bhi ab lagaataar hoti rahengi
 In the meeting, along with the electoral agenda, the agenda of the Parliament session was also discussed
 sansad main uttarkhand, khastahal arthvyavastha ke saath-saath bhrashtachar par bhi sarkaar ko nishane par lene par sahmati bani
 It is said that the in-charge of these committees was not announced on Thursday because Modi and Rajnath Singh want to consult the concerned people as well as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh before finalizing it
 board kii pichhali baithak ne varisht netaaon ke vichaaron ko dhyaan main rakhte hue modi or rajnath singh ko ye samitiyaan gathit karne kaa adhikaar diya tha
 It is said that former president Nitin Gadkari has refused to take charge of the committee on election campaign in Delhi
 dilli chunaavon main bijepi ke kharaab pradarshan kii aanshaka ke chalate shaayad unhone isse inkaar kiya he
 Also, being a former party president, he considers it a minor role for himself
 khabaron ke anusaar vah rajasthan vidhansabha chunaav kaa prabharee banaae jane ke icchhuk hai
 Topics raised by the party were also discussed during the monsoon session of Parliament starting from 5 August in the board meeting
 sarkaar kii ore se pesh hone vaale vidheyakon par bijepi kii ore se apanaai jane vaali ranneeti par vichaar vimarsh hua
 Party sources said that the BJP would support the Food Security Bill but would insist on some amendments
 board ne haalanki beemaa kshetra main epadiai ko 26 se 49 pratishat kiye jane ke sarkaar ke haal ke faisle kaa virodh karne kaa nirnay kiya he
 In the monsoon session, the party will also raise issues related to alleged laxity in the rescue and relief operations of the government in Uttarakhand due to rains, security situation of the country, differences between IB and CBI and corruption

 Today, big things are being done through the social networking site Facebook
 kabhi koi murder mistry sulajh jaati he to kabhi barason ke bichade log aapas main mil jate hai
 a case related to Facebook has also come up in Betul, Madhya Pradesh, where the police shared its photo to remove the encroachment on the road
 is par itane caments aane shuru hue ki dukaan maalik ne atikaraman hataa liya
 This makes the people as well as the police happy
 yah bhi mana jane laga he ki fasebuk kaa upyog samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Large machines were placed in front of the shop located in the police station area of betul
 dukaan maalik ne eent, ret, gitti bhi sadak ke kinare main daal rakhi thi
 The encroachment could not be removed despite the police convincing
 kotwali tii ai ne is dukaan ke saamne kii photo khinchakar fasebuk par daal di or logon se suzav bhi maange the
 Someone wrote that if the encroachment is removed along with the municipality, then someone wrote that if the police run the stick, the encroachment will be removed
 post daalane ke baad ise dukaan maalik ne bhi dekha or logon ke suzav padhakar use apni galati kaa ahsaas ho gaya
 He felt that in this way he was also going to be socially infamous, so the encroachment was removed quietly without any controversy
 baad main dukaan maalik kotwali pahunchaa or tii ai se haath jodakar maafee bhi maangi or police ne bhi tatkaal is post ko fasebuk se hataa diya
 This police effort has sent a better message to the police in general public as well
 fasebuk kaa sahaara lene ke baad atikaramankarta ko apni galati samaj main ai or jo kaam mushkil najar aa rahaa tha vah bina kisi vivaad ke sulajhaa liya gaya
 Businessmen say that they have learned from this effort of the police that the common people may have to grapple with the misrule by not encroaching on the road

 When it comes to taking Irfan Khan seriously, this saying fits on the Hindi film industry
 videshi filmon main khud ko sametate ja rahe irfankhan kii film piku unke prashansakon or aalochakon donon ke liye myne rakhti he
 But how irresponsible does Irfan take this industry and what is his opinion on Hindi films? Well, in a special discussion with us, he answered all these questions
 aapane film 'piku' ke liye haa kyon kaha?shoojit sarkaar or lekhak juhi chaturvedi ke kaam karne kaa tarika maine dekha he
 The presence of both in the film was enough to say yes to this film
 aap kis tarah kii filmein dekhte hai ?aisi film jo baar baar aapako dekhne ke liye vivash kare
 Like i had recently seen 'birdman', it was fun seeing Keaton's best acting
 hindi filmein nahin dekhte aap?hindi filmein kabhi kabhi dekhtaa hum
 i see the film in which it seems that time will not be wasted, there will be no annoyance
 film 'finding pheni' maine dekhi thi or abhi 'dam lagaake haisha ' dekhni he, suna he kaaphi acchhee film he
 How was the chemistry with Deepika Padukone? i always see as a co-star what the front actor's attitude, story and character are for
 ye script aisi thi kii aapako bagaiyr kahe sabakuch kahana he
 When i first shot with Deepika, i thought she was very keen to play the character
 haalanki wo number 1 adaakara hai
 But the way she was eager to play the role of Piku was a compliment
 vaise bhi is film kii story hi star he
 Is 'piku' a sequel to your own film 'namesake'? No, it is not
 film 'nemsek' main main ek pita kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahaa tha
 This is a different film
 kya aap bhi bengali kirdaar nibhaa rahe hai film main ?nahin nahin,main bengali kirdaar main nahin hum, mujhe darasal film main bengaaliyon se problem hoti he 
 Just Deepika is in Bengali character
 aapako lagata he ki film 'piku' ke baad bengali log aapke kirdaar se nafrat karne lagenge?(hansate hue) mujhe lagata he ku bengali logon ko unke bare main pataa chal jayega

 The political rivalry of Bhupesh Baghel and Ajit Jogi, the two big centers of Chhattisgarh politics till the assembly elections, is evident

 Actually, Bhupesh Baghel has become the biggest face of the state's politics after becoming the Chief Minister
 jogi or bhupesh ke bich pichley do saalon se jamkar talkhi bhare na keval bayaan media main surkiyon main rahe, balki bhupesh ko chaaron khaane chitt karne ke liye jogi kheme ne sam, daam, dand, bhed kaa bharpoor upyog kiya
 The situation changed after the election that Ajit Jogi and his leaders had to take the path of Bhupesh Baghel

 jogi khemaa is mulaakaat ko saamaanya shishtachar qaraar de rahe hai jabaki raajnneetik vishleshak kah rahe hai ki mukhyamantri bhupesh baghel se milane ke liye jogi parivaar ko chhattisgarh bhawan main ek ghante tak intjaar karnaa padaa
 Jogis do not usually wait for anyone
 unke is vyavhaar se rajnatik galiyara garmaya hua
 Politicians also say that the winter session of the Legislative Assembly is to begin after two or three days
 jogi chaahate to unki mulaakaat vidhansabha ke andar baahar acchhee tarah se ho sakati thi lekin unka achaanak bilaspur ja kar bhupesh baghel se mulaakaat karnaa kisi na kisi ghatana ko jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 However, many things are being extracted from this meeting
 hakeekat kya hai, iskaa patato samay batayega lekin ajit jogi or bhupesh baghel kii is mulaakaat se donon netaaon ke rishton main jami barf pighalegi yah kah paanaa mushkil he

 kahaan to upi ke purv mukhyamantri apane kaarykaal main noida aane ke naam se hi khauf khate the ki kahin apshagun ke kaaran kursi naa chali jaae, vahiin upi ke maujuuda mukhyamantri yogi adityanath 15 din ke antaraal main hi teen baar noida kaa daura kar chuke hai
 Yogi arrived at the Youth Festival in Greater Noida on Friday
 yogi se pehleuttar pradesh ke mukhyamantreerah chuke akhilesh yadav apane kaarykaal ke dauraan ek baar bhi noida nahin aae
 It was believed that whatever happens on the Chief Minister's chair in UP, if he goes to Noida, he has to lose his chair due to bad omen
 iske liye kuch mukhyamantriyon kii kursi jane ke udhaaharan bhi die jate the, lekinkhilesh yadavake mukhyamantri rahete hue noida naa aane ke peeche yogi sarkaar ke ek mantri ne kuch or hi vajah bataai he
 UP Industries Minister Satish Mahana says that Akhilesh was afraid of coming to Noida not because of any superstition but because he should not face the anger of flat investors
 bataa den ki noida main hajaaron niveshak aise hai jo bilders ko puraa paisa dene ke baavjood kai varshon se apane flats milane kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 The Yogi government is preparing for an investment conference in Lucknow on 21-22 February
 iskaa udghaatan pradhanmantri narendra modi ko karnaa he
 Industry Minister Mahana is camping in Delhi in this regard
 mahana ne ‘aaj tak’ se baatcheet main kaha ki pehle logon ko noida aane main dar lagata tha
 Not because you will win again or not, but because people may not come before anyone
 hamaare mukhyamantri yahaan aate bhi hai or logon kii samasya sunakar samaadhaan nikalne kii koshish bhi kar rahe hai
 Mahana said that this problem related to flat investors has been created by the previous governments, who made no effort to solve it
 kharidaaron ne 2006 se 2008 main apane flats book karaae the or bilders ne unako 5-6 saal main flats kaa kabja dene ke liye kaha tha
 The flat, booked in 2006, should have been found in 2012 but not in 2017
 ye samasya unki khadi kii hui he
 The Industries Minister claimed that after handling the work of Group of Ministers formed to deal with the problem of incomplete flats, so far, 32 thousand flats have been given the completion certificates
 mahana ke mutabik pehle kisi builder ko project puraa karne ke baad noida praadhikaran se pramaan patr lene ke liye chakkar lagane padate the, ab ulta he, hamaare adhikari builder ko bula kar kehete hai ki agar project puraa he to kampalishan certificate le jaao
 Mahana accused the previous governments that everyone knows how much money they took to give the plot
 mahana ke mutabik is sarkaar kii sahanubhuti un logon ke saath he jinaki gadhi kamai bilders ne hadap lee he
 The government and the Chief Minister are trying to get people to get their flats by putting pressure on such builders in a legal way
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanathflatt niveshkonse do teen baar mil chuke hai
 On the demand of sending investors to jail for cheating the builders, he said that there are some builders who are also in jail, when their investors bring the problem, the question arises who should we talk to
 mahana ke mutabik sarkaar kii pehali koshish he ki kisi tarah bilders se logon ke flats banavaaen, agar nahin maane to jail jaaenge
 Mahana said that the government is conducting survey of the builders, it will know the status of how much work has been done, how much it will cost to complete the project
 ham ye bhi pataa laga rahe hai ki bilders ne niveshkon kaa kitna paisa duusari jagah lagaaya he taaki difolter builder kii sampatti jabt karne kii karrwai kaa vikalp bhi rahe

 gahalot ke saath unke cabinet ke kai mantri bhi the
 When several cabinet ministers along with Gehlot arrived at the famous Sahu Tea Stall of Jaipur-wide Rasta, there was an uproar
 mangalvaar subah 8 baje gahalot ke saath parivahan mantri pratap singh khachariyavaas, urja mantri bidi kalla, khel mantri ashok chandana, mahesh joshi or krishna punia bhi shaamil the
 All these people took a taste of Sahu Tea Stall's famous Kulhad tea and also enjoyed Mathri and Ban Maska
 isi bich aaj tak kii team ne unase mulaakaat kii
 Anil Sahu and his brother, who were watching the work at Sahu Tea Stall, told Aaj Tak that everyone stayed for 40 minutes and enjoyed tea, mathri and bun maska
 ajtak ne anil sahu se sawaal poocha ki kul kitne log gahalot or unki team main the
 Anil said that the Chief Minister himself had arrived with his cabinet ministers and that 30 to 35 people had come and many people were also standing outside
 doosraa sawaal tha ki un logon kaa charchaa kaa vishay kya tha?anil ne kaha, 'kai muddon par vichaar-vimarsh hua or aksar gahalot pehle bhi sahu tii stall par aate rahe hai or wo hi nahin, rajasthan kii purv mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje bhi kai baar sahu tii stall par aa chuki hai or vahaan aana kai rajaneta apane liye shubh maanate hai
 The question then arose that all those who had come, did they eat tea, banana mascara and matri? So the answer was, yes everyone enjoyed them
 aglaa sawaal tha ki khaane-pine ke baad kharchaa kisne uthaaya to jawaab mila ki gahalot sarkaar main urja mantri bidi kalla ne 500 rupee die the
 Let me tell you that the price of one Kuld tea at this shop is 20 rupees, one Mathri 10 rupees, Ban Maska 30 rupees
 aise main ek vyakti kaa kharchaa 60 rupee baithta he
 If the calculation is made from 50 rupees, then the cost of 30 people is Rs 1500 but the minister kept running with only 500 rupees

 is wyk main vailemtine de se 2 din pehle yani 12 farvari ko hag de celibratt kiya jaataa he
 What could be more beautiful than realizing your crush or your partner's hag
 jin bhaawanaaon ko shabdon ke jariye bayaan nahin kiya ja saktaa he, un jazbaat ko pyaar se kisi ko gale lagaakar kar sakate hai
 This day is not just for lovers, but this day can be celebrated with anyone
 to is hag de apane partner ke saath apane parents, bhai, bahan, doston ko bhi ek pyaar bharaa hag jarur karen, kyonki kisi ko gale lagane se ek khubasurat ehsaas to hota hi he, saath hi sehat ko bhi kai phaayde hote hai
 This has been confirmed in many studies
 ye hai hag karne ke phaayde-1
 Beneficial for the heart - a study report has reported that doing hag increases the levels of the love hormone oxytocin in the body
 isse dil sehatmand rahata he
 2
 blad pressure kam hota he-vaigyanikon ke mutabik, hag karne se blad pressure bhi kam hota he
 This is due to release of oxytocin hormone in the body
 59 logon par hui ek study main bataaya gaya he ki jo log aksar apane partner ko hag karte hai, unka blad pressure control main rahata he
 3
 tanaav kam hota he-kai study main bataaya gaya he ki kisi special vyakti ko hag karne se stress hormone cortisol kaa str kam hota he
 By doing hag, the tension is reduced as well as the memory of the person also intensifies
 4
 Mood is fresh - Researchers believe that a person's mood is also fresh by doing hag
 darasal, jab aap kisi ko hag karte hai to aapke dimag main serotonin hormone adhik maatra main produs hota he, jo aapkaa mood fresh rakhane main madad karata he
 Hag also increases a person's ability to work
 5
 The risk of illnesses is low - in a study conducted on more than 400 people, researchers found that a person is less likely to get sick by doing hag
 jin logon ko partner kaa saport miltaa he wo kam biimaar padate hai
 a sign board on the bandra-worli Sea Link welcomes the drivers, which reads, 'south Mumbai
 ' dilachasp baat yah he ki is par bana tir asal main uttar kii ore ishaara karata he
 In this way, the trains move in the wrong direction for about 150 meters and then take a u turn from a traffic circle and then move in that direction, where they have to go
 2009 main jab se yah pul aam logon ke liye chaalu hua he, mumbai ke ek khaas tabake or mizaaj ke log ise shahar kii sambhaavnaaon kaa pratik maanate rahe hai
 But this sea link has proved to be more of a decorative idiom for Mumbai
 is pul kii laagat anumaan se paanch guna zyada rahi he or ise banane main bhi 10 saal kaa samay lag gaya-anumaan se paanch saal zyada
 This bridge is not a symbol of the administrative inefficiency of the city just because it took much time and money to build it
 mumbai main rahane vaale 1
 Out of the 25 crore people, 72 lakh people travel on daily crowded local trains
 mahaj 40,000 vaahan hi har kaamkaaji din si link se hokar guzarate hai
 The emphasis on infrastructure for private vehicles rather than public traffic is both reflective of wrong urban policy and undemocratic politics
 beshak is pul ke liye tamaam utsaah dikhaane ke baavjood mumbaivasi iske istemaal ke liye apni jeb dhili karne ke liye katai taiyaar nahin hai
 When sealink was opened, traffic was so low that the administration was forced to reduce the toll tax
 isse beparwaah prashasan ab bhi is si link ko badhaakar ise shahar ke dakshin chor nariman point tak le jane kii yojana bana rahaa he
 Although the sign board at the Bandra end of the bridge is more correct, the socio-economic indicators of those living around it do not give reason to be very happy
 vaise to ek survey bataata he ki is ilaake main rahane vaale kareeb 40 fisadi pariwaron kii aay 10 lakh ru
 More than that, but the shocking figure is that 78 per cent of the people of h (west) Municipal Ward live in the slum
 bandra isi ward main he
 Advocates in Mumbai often argue that such a culmination is found in all major cities
 agar paribhaashik rup se dekhen to sabase amir or sabase garib kii khai yahaan behad gahari he
 According to the 2001 census, 54 percent of Mumbai's people live in slums
 bharat kii vanijyik rajdhani main haashie kaa jivan vastav main sabase zyada numaayan he
 But the situation was not always like this
 pichhali sadi ke zyaadaatar varshon main mumbai aisa shahar tha jo bharat kii kalpanaaon main sabase zyada hiloren bharta tha
 For decades, the city's population continued to grow due to the influx of migrants who came from other parts of Maharashtra or from different parts of India
 myth rachane waalon ke shabdon main kahen to pravaasiyon kii bheed mumbai main amir banane ke khwab sanjoe aa rahi thi
 But in reality they were more pragmatic, wishing to work permanently in one of the city's various factories or their associated enterprises
 1951 main sangathit kshetra main mumbai ke 72 fisadi shramikon ko rojgaar mila hua tha
 But after liberalization, it started changing rapidly
 1981 se 2007 ke bich aupchaarik kshetra ke rojgaar main 0
 83 percent decline every year
 iskaa nateeja yah niklaa ki pravaas kii yah dhara-shahar ke aakarshan kaa prabal sankawt-kam ho gai
 Natural growth is now the biggest factor in Mumbai's growth
 anaupchaarik kshetra kaa ab bhi shahar ke rojgaar main kareeb do-tihaai yogadan he
 The pressure of 'flexibility of labor rules' that came with liberalization has led to a huge increase in sub-contracts, contract jobs and casual employment
 kaam ke kshetra ke is tarah se anaupchaarik hote jane ne shahar ke bhautik paridrishy par bhi asar daalaa he
 One Mumbai is gleaming with steel and curtain glass, the other is parts of Mumbai, tarpaulin and tin thatch
 yah shahar nav-udaaravaadi asamantaaon kaa pratik he
 In Mumbai's pain, the scandal in the deals related to the city's scarce resource land has increased manifold
 pichley do dashakon ke permit raaj ne niyam banane vaale netaaon, unhen lagu karne vaale afasarshahon or unhen todane-marodane kii chahat rakhane vaale bilderon ke aapasi gathjod ko badhaava diya he
 Rarely do they get busted, as happened in the Adarsh apartment complex in Colaba
 yah imaarat 'raksha sevaaon ke sevarat or ritred karmiyon ke kalyaan ke liye' manjuur kii gai thi, lekin kai netaaon or afasarshahon ke parivaar waalon ne isamen apartment hasil kar liye
 It is alleged that the apartments were given to them at a much lower price than the market price
 is ghotaale kii vajah se ek mukhyamantri ko apni kursi ganvaani padi he or do anya ke khilaaf jaanch chal rahi he, or teen iees adhikariyon purv nagarpalika ayukta jayraj pathak, purv shahari vikaas sachiv ramanand tiwari or shahar kii jameen ke record ke prabharee purv jila colector pradeep vyas ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 But many such violations of the rules have not come in the eyes of the investigating agencies or public
 inamen se kuch shahar ke slam rihabilitation skim ke tahat chal rahi kai nirmaan pariyojnaayen hai
 Under this scheme, developers are given heartfelt facilities to build free houses for the slum dwellers
 lekin aisi kai pariyojnaon ke labhaarthiyon ne shikaayat kii he ki unase rajamandi lene ke jo patr dikhaae ja rahe hai, ve farji hai
 The developers have been given very large plots, while very small parts of these have been given houses to the slum dwellers and with the intention of building more houses than the sanction, the developers have increased the number of slum dwellers in many plots
 pichley saal, neshnal alliance of piples movement kii netaa medha patkar ne golibaar kii ek jhoparpatti punarvaas basti main niyamon ke kathith ulanghan ko lekar anshan kiya tha
 Golibar Khar is a slum settlement spread over 140 acres in the east
 unhone yah dharna tab khatm kiya jab rajya sarkaar ne unke aaropon kii jaanch ke liye do sadasyeey samiti banane par apni sahmati jataai thi
 But only a few weeks later, the Chief Minister dissolved the panel
 jab 1995 main slam rihebilitation athurity (esare) manjuur hui thi, tab maharashtra sarkaar ne anumaan lagaaya tha ki punarvaas ke liye kareeb aath lakh makaan banane kii jarurat he
 More than 15 years later, in April this year, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) informed that in reality only 1
 27 lakh makaan hi banaae gaye hai, jabaki is bich jhuggi-jhopadi main rahane waalon kii sankhya teji se badi he
 Apart from this, the slum organizations also insist that the idea of giving free houses to more than half of the city's population is bad economics, which has completely destroyed Mumbai's property market

 rape ke maamle main doshi gurmeet ram rahim ko sibiai court rohtak jail main aaj sajaa sunayegi
 a sadhvi from the ashram had accused her of rape 15 years ago
 rape ke alaava bhi us par kai duusare sangeen aapraadhik maamle hai
 The life of Ram Rahim, who came out of a modest village, is nothing less than a mystery
 haal hi main usne apana 50waan janmdin manaaya tha
 Leaving two children and a wife, Ram Rahim retired to the dera at the age of 23
 ajtak ke saath ek khaas baatcheet main ram rahim ne apane jivan se judi jaankariyaan saajha kii thi
 During this time, he told an interesting story of his birth and retirement
 ram rahim kii zubaani is tarah hua tha janmaram rahim apane mata-pita kii iklauti santan he
 Now how much truth is there in this thing is not confirmed, but he claimed that despite many years of marriage, his parents were not having children
 uskaa parivaar deraa sachcha sauda se judaa hua tha
 Parents placed the problem of not having children in front of Derasant Triveni Das
 tab deraa mukhiya ne kaha ki uske bachche honge, par isaki ek shart he
 The child will remain with them for only 23 years
 iske baad vah jis kaam ke liye aayaa he vah karegaa
 Ram Rahim claims that he was born a few months after the parents agreed
 pita ko maaloom tha main le luungaa sanyasaisi intervyuu main usne daawa kiya ki uske pita ko maaloom tha ki main 23 kii umr ke baad sanyas le luungaa
 According to Ram Rahim, this is why his father got married at the age of just 17
 jald hi ram rahim ek bete or do beti kaa pita bana
 He left home following the orders of the dera chief on completion of 23 years
 haalanki kuch reports ke mutabiq aaj bhi uski patni deraa main hi rahati he
 She is not seen much in public and remains active in social work related to the dera
 jabaki uske betaa-beti kii shaadi ho chuki he
 Her son is a business man and Bahu is the daughter of a Congress leader
 ram rahim ne haniprit ko bhi god liya he
 What else did Ram Rahim say in the interview Ram Rahim gave funny answers to many questions beyond logic
 apni bahumukhi pratibha ko usne ishwariya anubhutiyon se joda
 What is the God who created the world, how he got his name Ram Rahim, how and when did Insa join at the end of the name, how he became a actor and rock star from satsang Baba and gave a funny answer to all these questions
 or is tarah baba ban gaya rock staraisi intervyuu main ram rahim ne bataaya ki vahayuvaaon ko prerana dene ke liye abhinayta or rock starbana
 According to him, he used to inspire the youth through satsang against social evils like drug addiction
 ek karmyogi kii prerana ko vyapak str par pahunchane kii koshish main vah satsang main pravachan dene vaale baba se rock star, abhinayta ban gaya, filmon kaa nirmaan kiya

 ' The next hearing in the Nirbhaya case will be held on December 13, the 2 convicts in this case are filing the petition
 court ne apane aadesh main kaha ki sabhi bataaen ki wo koi arji lagaana chaahate hai yaa nahin
 The court will now hold the next hearing in the case on 13 December
 court main aaj hui sunwaayee mentihaad prashasanne nirbhaya cese ke chaaron doshiyon par states report patiala house court main daakhil kar diya
 The Tihar Jail Administration told the court that the guilty plea has filed a mercy petition before the President on 4 December
 jabaki mukesh or pawan is maamle main curative pitishan daakhil karne vaale hai
 However, the status of Akshay, the fourth convict in the case, is not clear at present whether he wants to have a curative petition or mercy petition in this case
 nyaay ke liye kitna intjarnirbhaya ke mata-pita kii taraf se pesh vakil ne kaha ki hamen aakhir nyaay ke liye kitna intjaar karnaa hoga? court ne emicas curi se kaha ki is tarah ke maamalon main samay seemaa kaa dhyaan rakhte hue court ke adeshon kaa paalan kiya janaa chahie
 The court questioned how the court can issue a death warrant while the mercy petition is pending
 emicas curi ne kaha ki is maamle main court ek taarikh tay kar de ki wo is taarikh tak curative pitishan yaa dayaa yachika daakhil karne ja rahe hai
 The government's work parents said that the counsel for the parents of Kianirbhaya said that all the culprits are deliberately wasting time in this case, so that the execution of the sentence is prolonged
 court ne kaha ki is maamle main kanoon or niyam ke hisaab se hi court aadesh kar saktaa he lekin dayaa yachika par niptaare ke bina court deth warrant jari nahin kar saktaa
 Counsel for Nirbhaya's parents said that curative petitions are the remedies for the culprits, not their rights
 court ke kaha ki lekin doshiyon ke paas jo bhi remedi he, court isse unhen vanchit nahin kar saktaa
 In this case, Amicus Curiae said that even after the Supreme Court rejected the appeal of all the convicts last year, the state government did not come to issue the death warrant, Nirbhaya's parents have come, that is, the work they did for the government, they did

 is world cap main abhi tak team india ajey he or isi kram ko vah windies ke khilaaf bhi barkaraar rakhana chaahegi
 At the same time, West Indies is struggling with lack of confidence after many defeats

 shami-bumrah will be responsible Shami, who came into the team after Bhuvneshwar's injury, is also expected to play against the West Indies because the situation is not clear yet about Bhubaneswar's injury
 haalanki unhone mangalvaar ko fijio kii dekharekh main kareeb aadhe ghante tak abhyaas jarur kiya tha, lekin team prabandhan bhubaneshwar ko lekar kisi tarah kaa jokhim nahin lenaa chahega
 So Shami and Jasprit Bumrah will have the responsibility to stop the stormy batting order of the West Indies

 India's middle-order needs to be in rhythm Against Afghanistan, India's middle-order concern was once again revealed

 The same was seen against Afghanistan

 7wein vetan ayog (7th Pay Commission) ko lekar na sarkaar ke paas zyada kuch kehane ko he na hi karmchaariyon netaaon ko paas
 It is a big irony in itself that the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission were implemented by the government in the last week of June
 vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko lagu karne kii taarikh 1 janvari 2016 thi
 As usual, the coalition objected on behalf of some of the recommendations of the Pay Commission and the government formed committees and invited representatives of the employees to discuss every issue
 vaise saatven vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ke lagu hone ke saath karmchaariyon main itnaa gussa tha ki unhone hadtaal par jane kii dhamkee de di
 The government formed committees under pressure
 samitiyon ko apni report chaar maheene main hi deni thi
 But eight months have passed and no issue has been completed in the Allowance Committee on issues other than HRA
 echaare ko lekar bhi kuch bhi baat nahin ho paa rahi he
 This committee, headed by the Finance Secretary, has given its report
 echaare ke ek alaava baaki do darjan se zyada alounces ko lekar samiti ke saath karmchaaree netaaon ne baat kii he
 It is reported from the sources that the government's stance on some allowances is somewhat soft and the government can either resume some allowances or increase the rate of some allowances being given
 (7waan vetan ayog : alouns samiti ne echaare (HRA) par di apni report, milegi khushi or gam bhi) Eight months have passed for the decision to implement the recommendations of the Pay Commission, but the snow has yet to be seen between the staff leaders and government representatives
 (7waan vetan ayog : echaare (HRA) par faisla ab sarkaar ke haath main, karmchaaree netaaon ne yah kaha) According to information received from the sources, what seems to be resolved in the negotiations, is the minimum pay scale, some allowance and HRA
 yani in baton par karmchaariyon ko kuch acchhee khabar mil sakati he
 (good news for central employees: Center may increase dearness allowance by 2 percent from January 1) Comments vahiin, enpies or baaki kai alouns par sarkaar apane rukh par kaayam bataai ja rahi he
 That is, according to the news of the employees on these issues so far, disappointment has gone hand
 karmchaaree netaa shivagopal mishra ne enditivi ko bataaya ki enpies ke mudde par 17 march ko baatcheet hogi
 Apart from this, some other allowances will also be discussed
 hameshaa kii tarah vetan ayog kii kuch siforeeshon ko lekar karmchaariyon kii ore se gathbandhan ne aapatti jataai or sarkaar ne samitiyon kaa gathan kar har mudde par baatcheet ke liye karmchaariyon ke pratinidhiyon ko aamantrit kiya
 However, with the implementation of the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission, the employees were so angry that they threatened to go on strike
 dawaab main sarkaar ne samitiyon kaa gathan kiya tha
 The committees were to submit their report within four months
 lekin aath maheene biit gaye hai or alouns samiti main echaare ko chhodkar baaki muddon par koi baat puri nahin hui he
 There is no talk about HRA either
 vitt sachiv ke netritv main bani is samiti ne apni report de di he
 Apart from the HRA, staff leaders have spoken with the committee on more than two dozen allowances
 sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki kuch alounces ko lekar sarkaar kaa rukh kuch naram he or sarkaar kuch alounces ko yaa to phir se shuru kar sakati he yaa phir die ja rahe kuch alouns kii dar ko badha sakati he
 (7th Pay Commission: Allowance committee gave its report on HRA, Khushi and sorrow too) vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko lagu karne ke nirnay liye aath maheene biit gaye hai lekin abhi tak karmchaaree netaaon or sarkaar ke pratinidhiyon ke bich kii barf pighalati dikh nahin rahi he
 (7th Pay Commission: Decision on HRA) now in government's hands, employee leaders said) sutron se mili jaankaree ke anusaar jo kuch thodaa bahut baatcheet main maamla sulajhata dikh rahaa he, vah nunatam vetanman, kuch alouns or echaare he
 That is, employees can get some good news on these things
 (kendriya karmchaariyon ke liye khushkhabari : 1 janvari se mahangaai bhatta 2 pratishat badha saktaa he centre)tippaniyan At the same time, the government is being said to maintain its stand on NPS and many other allowances
 yani in muddon par karmchaariyon ke haath abhi tak kii khabar ke mutabik niraashaa hi haath lagi he
 Staff leader Shivgopal Mishra told NDTV that the NPS issue would be discussed on March 17
 iske alaava baaki kuch alouns par bhi baatcheet hogi
 Apart from the HRA, staff leaders have spoken with the committee on more than two dozen allowances

 In a meeting held on Thursday under the chairmanship of Noida DM BN Singh, it was decided that if no one intentionally jumps red light in Noida, then the driving license should be canceled by not challaning it
 iske tahat noida ketraphicapulice adheekshak report banaakar noida parivahan karyaalay ko bhejenge or vahaan se license ko nirast kar diya jayega
 Till now the DL was canceled for a maximum of 3 months, till now the driving license was broken and driving license was suspended for a maximum period of 3 months
 dilli main bhi yahi niyam lagu he, lekin ab noida main isse ek kadam aage badhkar niyam lagu kiya ja rahaa he
 Rules begin to break as soon as Noida crosses the border, as Delhi and Noida borders are close
 aise main adhiktar yah dekha gaya he ki jaise hi dilli kii seemaa se noida main pravesh karte hai to log niyam todna shuru kar dete hai
 In view of all this, the administration of Noida has now decided to take strict action
 kareeb 14 saal baad long turm capital gen (altisiji)taxwapas aayaa he
 With effect from April 1, 2018, those investing in equity mutual funds will get Rs 1 lakh annually
 se adhik kii aay par 10 pratishat altisiji tex bharna hoga
 However thank its Grandfather provision, which can save you from paying tax for the financial year 2017-18
 haalanki altisiji tex kam karne ke kuch tareeke hai
 
 
 Invest in the names of relatives
 Gifts from certain relatives (father, wife, children) are not taxed
 isliye visheshgy suzav dete hai ki aap apane nivesh kaa portpholio parijanon ke bich baant len
 Brajesh Dalmia, founder of Dalmia Advisory Service, explains, “every person gets a lakh
 tak kii chhot milti he
 You can make the tax very low or negligible due to dividing the portfolio among the family
 '' bacchon ke naam se nivesh main chhot tabhi milegi agar unki umr 18 saal yaa usase zyada he
 This is because according to the tax rules, children 18 years or older have their rights and are counted as individual
 long turm capital los ko darshaakar laabh lenshare yaa equity aadhaarit mutual fund main nivesh par hue long turm capital los ko darshaakar equity aadhaarit mutual fund par die jane vaale altisiji tex kii bachat kii ja sakati he
 For instance, a person invests Rs 2 lakh on investment in the mutual fund scheme "A"
 kaa altisiji banataa he or use equity mutual fund skim "bi'' par 1
 There is a long term capital loss of 2
5 million
 aise main vah skim "bi'' par hue nuksaan ko skim "e'' par hue phaayde ke saath darshaakar tex ko edjust kar saktaa he
 If the investor has incurred any long-term capital loss in direct equity shares, he can save tax by showing it as well
 upar bataae maamle main shuddh altisiji 75,000 ru
 Of Rs
 2 lakhs
 ke phaayde main se sava lakh ru
 Loss of Rs
 1 lakh)
 kii chhot seemaa se neeche he
 On this the investor can save LTCG
 phir se nivesh kar dentax ko nunatam karne kaa ek or tarika he
 You churn the portfolio because LTCG is calculated at the actual cost of acquisition
 portpholio main thodaa badlaav karke aap adhigrahan kii laagat ko badal sakate hai
 Suppose on April 20, 2018, Rs 180
 ke net asset vailu (enevi) par aapane kisi mutual fund skim kii 1,000 units kharidin
 As of April 2019 his NAV is Rs 260
 ho gaya
 So your 80,000 rupees
 kaa long turm capital gen hua
 If you sell all the units on 27 April 2019 and buy it again, your purchase price is now Rs 260
 or kharid taarikh 27 april 2019 ho jaaegi
 Now if the NAV is increased to Rs 345 next year
 ho jaataa he to aapaki aamadani85,000 ru
 Which will be one lakh rupees
 kii tex seemaa se kam he or aapako tex nahin dena hoga
 However, many people do not suggest adopting this strategy
 —kundan kishor*** The Indian women's hockey team had a 1–1 draw against South Korea on Sunday
 baraabar rahe mukaable ke saath bharat ne paanch maichon kii siries par 3-1 se kabja kar liya
 In the fifth and final match played against Korea, Vandana Kataria (48th minute) scored the only goal for the Indian team, while Bomi Kim (in the 50th minute) scored for the hosts
 pehle teen quarter main donon hi tiimon ne gol karne kii har sambhav koshish kii, lekin kisi ko safalataa haath nahin lagi
 The fourth quarter saw a further rise in the game
 vandana ne captain rani se mili paas ko korea ke gol post tak pahunchaaya or bharat ko 1-0 kii badhat dilaa di
 But, the guest team remained happy for a short time
 dakshin korea kii bomi kim (50 minute) ne do minute baad barabari gol daag diya
 In the final 10 minutes, both teams raced to the winning goal, but to no avail
 match barabari par samaapt ho gaya
 Team Rahul is under attack from within the Congress for the defeat of the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections
 kai congressi netaaon ne ek sur main kaha he ki sirf unheen logon ko netritv vaale pad diye jane chahie jinhen jamini kaaryon kaa anubhav ho or kathorta se aatm nirikshan hona chahie taaki party ko apana khoyaa hua aadhaar waapas paane main madad mil sake
 First Union Minister Milind Deora blamed the defeat on Rahul's advisors
 Now, many Congress veterans have started attacking the party leadership unabashedly and demanding a big change in the tone
 is puure masale kii shuruyaat congress ke purv kendriya mantri milind devda ne kii jab unhone rahul ke salaahkaaron ko haar ke liye jimmedaar tehraate hue kaha tha ki congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke salaahkaaron ko jamini hakeekat kii jaankaree nahin thi or jinhen koi chunavi anubhav nahin tha, ve nirnay le rahe the
 After this, several mps reacted to this one by one and bluntly spoke of a major change in the organization further, blaming the top leadership for the electoral defeat
 tharur bole- milind kii baat main sens hamilind devda ke hamale ke baad shashi tharur ne bhi apni pratikriya kuch is tarah di
 Tharoor said, 'milind is a good friend and good MP too and like him, many mps have put their views before the Congress President and they will act on it
 milind jo baat kar rahe hai usamen sens he
 But Rahul's advisors have only technical experts
 unke paas raajnneetik salaahkaaron main yuva saansad jitendra singh, arpyen singh, sachin payalat or murali devda hai
 They have political understanding, so we have to consider it very seriously
 tharur ne kaha, ‘rahul gandhi ke saath samvaad kii kami ne bhi ek bada role nibhaayaa
 We cannot meet them every day
 lekin yah bhi sach he ki rahul keval ek hi hai or ham main se har koi unase har hameshaa nahin mil saktaa
 He further said, "there should be open view in the party
 party ke bheetar is haar par khulkar samvaad hona chahie
 'pilots also want change, about 1 from Ajmer
 7 lakh voton se haare congress ke rajasthan unit ke adhyaksh sachin payalat ne rajasthan main sabhi siton par haar kii jimmedaari lete hue kaha ki wo aage kii ranneeti par ab kaam karenge
 Although the pilot is not sure of his defeat, he says, "I have opened an airport in Ajmer, 43 new trains, a central university and a women's college
 Even after that the defeat is not sure
" ’payalat ne haalanki sonia gandhi, rahul gandhi or manmohan singh ke netritv par koi sidhaa sawaal nahin uthaaya lekin sanghathanaatmak dhaanche main badlaav kii baat kar di
 Pilot said, "right now i can only say that we have to repair the organizational structure completely
 party main prayek pad ke liye chunaav hoga
 We must immediately remove unnecessary people from the party
 aam logon tak pahunchane waalon ko party main sheersh padon tak pahunchnaa hi hoga
 "knowledge of ground reality is not important to a large degree" RPN Singh said, "rahul Gandhi should have talked more with his voters
 wo party or congress varking cameti main puri tarah badlaav ke paksh main the jabaki ajay maakan or shashi tharur jaise netaa jinhen apni baaten matadaataaon tak pahunchane main maharath hasil he unhen bada kirdaar diya janaa chahie
 a political party cannot be an NGO
 bade collejon se degree hasil karnaa acchhee baat he lekin agar jamini hakeekat se waakif na hon to wo nirnay nahin le sakenge
 We should get rid of them
 ’‘devda kii baat bahut had tak sahi’udhar congress ke varisht netaa satyavrath chaturvedi bhi milind devda ke vichaaron se sahamat hote najar aaye
 He hoped that honest and rigorous self-inspection would be done to remove the problems
 unhone kaha ki ho saktaa he ki devda ne jo kuch kaha he vah puri tarah se sahi na na ho lekin jo unhone kaha he uskaa bada hissaa sahi he
 These comments are considered important in view of this growing perception in the party that many such people who had neither experience of elections nor understanding of the finer points of politics were important in shaping the leadership decisions on issues like campaigning and coalitions
 Role given
 janata se dur ho gaye hai congressi netaa: priya datjkhil bhartiya congress cameti kii sachiv priya dutt ne congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kii
 After this meeting, Priya Dutt also talked about the distance of the party leaders with the public
 unka kahana tha ki hamen is duuri ko paatna hoga
 In the last ten years, we have to consider where we went wrong
 haal ke loksabhaa chunaav main milind devda or priya dutt donon ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 Senior Congress leader Amarinder Singh, however, said that the party should take collective responsibility for the defeat
 devda ne foonka tha bigulpurv kendriya mantri milind devda ne rahul ke salaahkaaron ko haar ke liye jimmedaar tehraate hue kaha tha ki congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke salaahkaaron ko jamini hakeekat kii jaankaree nahin thi or jinhen koi chunavi anubhav nahin tha, ve nirnay le rahe the
 Milind Deora, a former MP from South Mumbai and a minister at the Center, again said his remarks stemmed from his deep loyalty to the party and the anguish caused by its poor performance in elections
 devda ne twitor par kaha, meri tippanee party ke prati gahari nishtha kii bhaawanaaon, chunaavon main hamaare pradarshan ko lekar pidaa or party kii punarvaapasi dekhne kii ek eemaandaar ichha se upji he
 Nothing more than this
 unhone twitor par ek anya tippanee main kaha, jamini party kaary or chunavi sangharsh jamini vaastaviktaaon ko samajhane ke liye mahatvapurn he
 This should become the basis for leadership positions in Congress
 dekhen devda ne kya twit kiya:my comments are out of emotions of deep loyalty to the party, pain of our performance & a sincere desire to see us bounce back
 Nothing more — Milind Deora (@milinddeora) May 22, 2014field party work & electoral battles are key to comprehend ground realities
 This should form the basis for leadership posts in Congress— Milind Deora (@milinddeora)may 22, 2014 The pair of Bhojpuri actress Amrapali Dubey and Nirahua has always done wonders in Bhojpuri cinema
 jald hi donon kii superhit jodi kai filmon main najar aegi

 a post shared by Aamrapali (@ aamrapali1101) on Apr 13, 2019 at 10:29 am PDT Amrapali Dubey (amrapali Dubey) was originally born in Chanhar village in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh
 unhone bhawan college, mumbai se snaatak kii oopaadhi praapt kii

 abhi tak unhone kul 25 filmein kii hai jo zyaadaatar hit rahi hai
 noida-greater Noida, adjacent to Delhi, is constantly encountering police with miscreants
 beete 10 dinon main ab tak 12 encounter kar gautamabuddha nagar police ne lagbhag do darjan badmaashon ko ghayal kiya he
 While more than a dozen criminals have been arrested
 haalanki police kii karrwai kaa badmaashon par koi asar nahin dikh rahaa he
 The orgy of miscreants continues in the area
 shuukravaar ko shaam dhalate hi sirf aadhe ghante main noida or greater noida main do encounter hue
 Police arrested three miscreants including two injured
 pehali muthbhed noida main hui
 Police recovered a bike, Rs 1,05,000 in cash, illegal weapons and some cartridges from here
 police ke mutabik shaam dhalate hi noida kii sector-20 police ne sector-8 main mubir kii soochna ke aadhaar par checking abhiyaan chalaaya
 Meanwhile, when the police made a gesture to stop the suspects riding two bikes, both the accused started fleeing while firing on the police
 police ne peechha kar kuch hi duuri par cross firing kii jisamen mushir naam ke badmaash ke pair main goli lagi or wo ghayal ho gaya, jabaki is badmaash ke duusare saathi harsh ko police ne aise hi giraftaar kar liya
 The police have admitted the injured to the district hospital for treatment
 shuruaati jaanch main saamne aayaa he ki mushir dilli ke nandangari kaa nivasee he or usapar lagbhag do darjan lut, hatya ke maamle darj hai
 This man was also wanted in a robbery incident in Noida
 noida main police badmaashon ko dabochne kii koshish kar hi rahi thi ki greater noida se khabar ai ki daaga gol chakkar ke paas checking ke dauraan do badmaashon ke saath police kii muthbhed hui he
 In this encounter, the crook Mustakim was shot in the leg while one of his companions escaped by taking advantage of the darkness
 philhal police ne ghayal ko ilaaj ke liye jila aspataal main bhartee kara diya he
 While the combing continues for the arrest of the absconding crook
 maukey se police ne ek bike, ek pistal sahit kuch kaartoos baraamad kiye hai
 Initial investigations have revealed that the injured crook is a resident of Tronica City Loni Ghaziabad
 police ke mutabik is shaks par lagbhag dedh darjan se mukademe darj hai
 a day before, a fierce group of women from the majority community pelted stones, the media is afraid of entering the village
 gaanv ke bahusankhyak samudaay ke zyaadaatar yuva gaayab hai or kathith police utpeeda yaa giraftaar ke dar se ve duusari jagahon par chale gaye hai
 The aggrieved minority family has expressed their intention to leave the village
 asli apradhi pravriti ko sab jaan rahe hai, lekin apradhi vyakti koun he, daawey se koi nahin jaanata
 The leaders are calculating political losses and losses
 vaise to yah gautamabuddha nagar ke bisaheda gaanv main sampradayik hinsa ke baad sitambar-aktubar 2015 ke halaat kii sapatabayani he, lekin agar isaki jagah mujffarnagar ke kutwa-kutvi, phugana, hasanpur yaa lisaad jaise gaanvon kaa naam daal diya jaae or taarikh sitambar 2013 kar di jaae to bhi donon ghatnakram kii aprihaary pariniti milti-julati hi dikhaai degi
 In fact, two years ago, the process of communalism started to vandalize in villages of western Uttar Pradesh, it seems to spread to Bihar and West Bengal, crossing eastern Uttar Pradesh along the Ganges
 is saal janvari main bihar ke mujffarpur ke ajitpur bahilwaara main “lav jehad” ke naam par paanch logon kii hatya kar di gai or 50 se zyada musalamaanon ke ghar jala die gaye
 This is not the only incident of communal tension in Bihar, though other incidents could not catch on
 isi saal may main pashchim bengal ke nadiya main bhayankar sampradayik sangharsh hua
 Both sides hurled shells at each other
 ilaake ke zyaadaatar ghar tabah kar die gaye
 Four people of the Hindu community were killed, while eight people were injured
 ise vahaan haal main hui hinsa main sabase khatarnaak mana ja rahaa he
 Moreover, in a relatively quiet state like Uttarakhand, on September 29, a tractor collided with a pile of stones in front of a shop and the matter turned into a communal feud
 ghatana main chaar log ghayal ho gaye or ilaake main dhara 144 lagaani padi
 Through these incidents, the poison of communalism is erupted from time to time, which is being poured into the society in a planned manner
 jaahir he, ilaake or pradesh ke rajnatik-saamaajik taane-bane ke lihaaj se vivaad kii shakl to badal jaati he, lekin fitrat vahi rahati he
 The reasons behind the controversy include rumor of cow slaughter, loudspeaker of temple or mosque, tampering with girls or slavery jehadya and sometimes even a collision in two vehicles on the road is enough to ignite the fire
 yah bhi sanyog nahin he ki pashchim upi main do saal pehle shuru hui hinsa kii rajnatik manzil loksabhaa chunaav the, to taaja hinsa ke saamne bhi maujuuda bihar chunaav, agle saal pashchim bengal chunaav or uske agle saal hone vaale uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav ke mile ke pathar khadey hai
 The figures of the Union Home Ministry also show increasing violence
 desh main varsh 2014 ke pehle chah maheene main sampradayik hinsa kii jahaan 252 ghatnaayen huin, vahiin 2015 main ye ghatnaayen badhkar 330 ho gayi
 The first six months of 2014 largely fall under the tenure of the Manmohan Singh government, while the figures for 2015 are those of the Modi government
 lekin pradhanmantri narendra modi ne sampradayik dangon yaa tanaav par aaj tak kuch nahin bolaa
 Neither did he say anything when communal riots took place in Faridabad, adjacent to Delhi, and neither are he speaking now, when the air of his parliamentary constituency Varanasi itself is getting worse
 unki chuppi tudwane ke liye nayantara sahagal or ashok vaajapeyi jaise lekhakon ne apane sahitya academy sakvamaan bhi lautaa die hai
 On the other hand, Uttar Pradesh Minority Affairs Minister Azam Khan told India Today, “modiji tell me what will be the condition of Muslims in his Hindu nation
 agar ve hamen jawaab de dete to yuan ko chitthee likhane kii jarurat hi nahin padati
 “uttar Pradesh has emerged as the most needed land of communalism
 agar pashchimi uttar pradesh kaa hi udhaaharan len to bisaheda gaanv ke baad muradabad se bhi isi tarah kii hinsa kii khabaren hai
 On the other hand, communal tension has already been seen in Shikohabad, Agra in early September
 purvi uttar pradesh kaa rukh karen to khud pradhanmantri ke sansadeey kshetra varanasi main ganesh visarjan ko lekar sadhu-mahanton or prashasan ke bich tikhi jhadap ho gai
 The view of Varanasi was such that the streets on which devotees carried flowers in their hands, there were stones in each hand in these narrow streets at 4:30 pm on 5th October
 yah varanasi kaa sabase prasidgh goduliya chairaha tha or yahaan hajaaron kii bheed police prashasan par apana aakrosh jaahir karne ke liye jeep, motor cycilen, pikat har kisi ko aag ke hawaale karne par amada thi
 In a short period of fire, fumes and black smoke rising from it covered Godoulia, the heart of Varanasi
 ek darjan gadipoon ko aag ke hawaale kar diya gaya
 In the fear of an outbreak, the administration imposed curcruity in four police station areas
 apni naakaami chhipaane ke liye police ne swami avimukteshwaranand, satua baba, patalpuri math ke mahant baba balak das samet 50 logon par danga bhadakaane kaa mukadmaa darj kar liya
 Since then, the SP government has once again given the opportunity to the Hindutva forces to unite in the entire state, which in the coming days may further increase the incidents of communal tension in the state
 isi ashanka ko bhaanpate hue mukhya sachiv alok ranjan ne kisi bhi jile main apriy ghatana hone par vahaan ke adhikariyon par kadi karrwai kii chetavanee jari kii he
 Former Director General of Police
 el
 Gupta explains, “the incidents of large-scale communal tension in UP also show that the SP government has no intention of stopping them
 ” unki baat par tab kyon na yakeen kiya jaae jab sarkaar ke mantri ajam khan khud id se do din pehle dijipi ko patr likhakar pashuvadh ke naam par musalamaanon par hinsa kii ashanka jataa chuke the, uske baavjood bisaheda main hinsa ho gai
 Another thing to note here is that if BJP leader Sangeet Som, local MP and Union Minister Mahesh Sharma are being accused of spreading communal tension in Bishera, then Congress MLA Ajay Rai in Varanasi is exactly the same
 yani bijepi ke ugr hindutv ke saamne haashie par aa gai congress bhi loklaj chhodkar dhire se hi sahi hindutv ke agenda se baahar dikhnaa nahin chaahati
 In such a situation, the question arises that if both the ruling party and the opposition instead of overcoming the communal frenzy, either promote it or get swept away, then how will the social fabric of democratic India be saved? On this question, the letter written by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru to the Chief Ministers of the states on June 4, 1949 becomes relevant
 panditji ne likhaa tha, “sampradayikta nishchit taur par adarshavaadiyon or saath hi avasarwaadiyon ko apni taraf khinchati he
 But the way it works is such that it goes away from any standard of morality and any kind of goodness of India
 isaki soch alag he
 But it has a bit of idealism that draws young people to themselves
 jin logon kii kisi uddeshy main aasthaa hoti he, unhen bal prayog se haraaya nahin ja saktaa
 They can only be defeated by a higher ideal, vision and ability to work for a noble cause
 ”(saath main akhilesh pandey) Patidar leader Hardik Patel has written an open letter to Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel
 isamen 14 sitambar kii baithak kaa zikr karte hue is mulaakaat main dhamkiyaan dene, baatcheet ke vakt gambhir na hone kii baat kahi gai he
 It is also written in the letter that 'do not consider Patidar's sons so weak
 ham shahadat se nahin hichakate
 In all cases, one cannot get favorite and desired results like Sanjay Joshi or Haren Pandya
 'hardik patidaar samaaj ko obisi kaa darjadilane ke liye andolan chalaa rahe hai
 He has written in the letter that 'if you want to suppress us, then that is acceptable to us
 hamen aashaa he ki aap isamen nahin hongi
 The warning you have given to us does not really translate into your administrative work, hence informing you
 baaki, hamaari jindagi ram bharose hai, ye jaan lijie
 The reason for writing the letter is to mock the attacks on us and the fake police cases being made against us and our allies
 yadi aap jaanate na hon
 'the letter also talks about being threatened and implemented

 ) The Delhi government has been continuously accused of publicizing its party on the pretext of advertising, in view of this, on Thursday, many Congress leaders, led by State Congress President Ajay Maken, have complained to the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi Najeeb Jung about the Aam Aadmi Party
 congress party ne uparajyapal se guzarish kii ke 864 karod rupaye aam aadmi party se liye jaaen or use aam aadmi party apane acount se dilli sarkaar ke fund main jamaa karen or is 864 crores rupye kaa istemaal sarkari kaary main kiya jaae uparajyapal najeeb jang ne congressi netaaon ko aashwaasan diya he ki wo jald is maamle ko dekhenge
 Ajay Maken has accused the Kejriwal government of propagating the Aam Aadmi Party with public money
 congress kaa aarope he ki tex peyar ke paise se aam aadmi party desh ke tamaam rajyon main apni party kaa prachaar kar rahi he or vigyaapan kaa yah bajet dilli sarkaar ke fund se chukaaya ja rahaa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Saharanpur on Friday

 Modi said, 'even Mulayam Singh wants the Parliament to run but those people (congress) do not want the country to benefit
 ' unhone kaha ki mulaayam singh hamaare virdohi hai lekin phir bhi sansad chalaane ko taiyaar hai, lekin aajcongressdesh ke liye khatra he
 Congress should do positive politics
 He said that if the Congress wants to remain in mainstream politics, it will have to do positive politics

 ' Delhi's political mercury has climbed after Kejriwal's cabinet minister Sandeep Kumar got caught in a sex scandal
 bijepi, congress ke alaava kabhi kejariwal ke saathi rahe prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav ne bhi aam aadmi party par hamalaa bol diya he
 About a year and a half ago, when Kejriwal's government was formed in Delhi, there were seven ministers in the cabinet
 lekin sandip kumaar kii barkhaastagi ke baad ab tak kul teen mantriyon kii chuttee ho gai he
 On 14 February 2015, when Kejriwal was sworn in as CM, he claimed that his party was a party of activists of honest and impeccable character
 unhone shaayad us vakt kalpana bhi nahin kii hogi ki unki cabinet ke logon kii vajah unki sarkaar kii itani fajihat hogi
 In such a situation, getting caught up in Sandeep Kumarka sex scandal is a big blow to Kejriwal government
 wo bhi aise samay main jab punjab or goa menvidhansabha chunaavake liye party taiyaariyaan kar rahi he or is dauraan ek ke baad ek museebataan aati ja rahi hai
 The strategy to save face before the election is the news that Kejriwal got the CD of the sex scandal 15 days ago, but when he felt that it has now come to the media too, he hurriedly sacked Sandeep Kumar
 virdohi is karrwai ko lekar bhi sawaal uthaa rahe hai ki sidi milane ke baad 15 dinon tak aakhir kejariwal ise dabaae kyon rakhe
 Apart from the three cabinet ministers of the Kejriwal government, many mlas of the Aam Aadmi Party have been accused of all kinds
 isse bhi party kii fajihat to hui he lekin kejariwal ne na to in vidhayakon or na hi daagi mantriyon ko party ne nikaala
 The action taken against political critic Sandeep Kumar is seen as Kejriwal's strategy to save the face of the Aam Aadmi Party government before the assembly elections in Punjab and Goa
 punjab main ab siddhu hi saharaam aadmi party ke liye punjab chunaav naak kaa sawaal ban gaya he
 The party has been preparing for this for quite some time
 lekin haal hi main punjab main aam aadmi party ke sanyojak rahe succha singh chhotepur sting oparation kaa shikaar hue or unhen party se nikaalnaa padaa
 AAP MP Bhagwant Mann is also in controversy over his misdeeds
 aise main punjab main aam aadmi party ko kisi bade chehre ko aage rakhana hoga jo damege control kar sake or chunaav main party kii naiya paar laga sake
 In the current environment, the party may not have a bigger face than Navjot Singh Sidhu, but the screw is still stuck on some issues
 goa main maukey par chaukaa maarane kaa vactagoa main sattarudh bijepi is vakt siyaasi sankat ke daur se guzar rahi he
 Sangh workers have threatened to defeat the BJP in the assembly elections after the removal of the state's RSS chief Subhash Welingkar
 aise main aam aadmi party ko is 'political gap' main ghusane kaa mauka mil saktaa he
 He also has an opportunity to capitalize on his clean image in the upcoming election
 video massej se damege control kii koshishasandip kumaar ke khilaaf karrwai ke baad siem kejariwal ne apane kaaryakartaaon ke liye video sandesh jari kiya
 In this, he not only expressed grief on the misdeeds of Sandeep Kumar, but also raised his hand about the character of his workers
 unhone kaha ki kisi ke maathe par nahin likhaa hota ki uskaa charitra kaisaa hota he
 However, during this time he also retaliated against his political opponents that Congress and BJP do not take action against their tainted leaders
 jabaki aam aadmi party 'jiro tolerance' kii niti par kaam kar rahi he
 In addition to Punjab leaders Amarinder Singh and Majithia, the CM also named the names of MP CM Shivraj Singh, Rajasthan CM Vasundhara Raje, Chhattisgarh CM Raman Singh and former Gujarat CM Anandiben Patel
 kejariwal se pehle jab dipti siem manish sisodiya bhi media ke saamne aae to unhone party kii 'jiro tolerance policy' kaa zikr kiya tha
 The tainted minister played the role of Sandeep Kumar, who was looking after the work of three ministries including women and child development in the Dalit Kardeshwar government, when the whole world saw the reality, he tried to cover up his misdeeds
 sex sidi aane ke kareeb 12 ghante baad media ke saamne aae sandip kumaar ne kaha ki dalit hone kii vajah se unpar aise aarope lagaae ja rahe hai
 The dismissed minister even said that the person appearing in the CD is not that
 keechad oochhaalane kii siyasat tejek ke baad ek apane cabinet mantriyon or vidhayakon par lag rahe aaropon or unki karatootein saamne aane se baukhalaai aam aadmi party ne virodhiyon par tikhaa palatwaar kiya he
 Party leader Sanjay Singh did not spare the former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, while retaliating on the BJP
 unhone kaha, 'bijepi yah bataae ki vaajapeyi ji ne apana kunvaaraapan kahaan-kahaan ganvaaya he
 Accused BJP President Amit Shah of spying on a woman
 unhone yogendra yadav tak ko nahin choda
 However, in spite of the vigorous publicity campaign in the beginning, the Kejriwal government took a very deliberate decision to save the slippery political ground in Punjab and gave a message to stick to its promise of following purity and morality in politics
 baavjood iske kuch sawaal aise hai jinke jawaab milane baaki hai
 For example, who is behind this sting operation? Was it all planned in advance and was it done by someone within the party? The big question is also: under which law does this act of Sandeep Kumar come under the purview of crime? tiktok Top 10: tiktaoc (tiktok) par roj kii tarah aaj bhi kai video viral (viral Video) ho rahe hai

 gujarat daure par aae bijepi ke varisht netaa or purv vitt mantri yashavanth sinha ne ahmedabad main modi sarkaar ko hitalarshahi qaraar diya
 Taking a dig at PM Modi, Sinha said that when it is said that nothing has happened for 70 years, then nothing happened in the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 ye to puri hitalarshahi he
 When this country had a monarchy, it was still a democracy
 lokshahi kaa matlab sahmati he, jisamen vipaksh or janata kii bhi sahmati honi chahie
 When the PM started talking about his style of speaking, Sinha quipped on the manner of speaking of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 sinha ne sabase pehle kaha, 'deviyon or bhaaiyon, jaanboojhkar mitron nahin bol rahaa hum
 Sinha, who is angry about demonetisation and GST, has reached Gujarat on a three-day tour
 ve ahmedabad ke baad rajkot or surat jaaenge
 In Gol and demonetisation, Sinha in Sinha's Bolahmadabad strongly attacked GST and notbandi
 sinha ne kaha ki agar jiesti aazaadee ke baad itnaa hi bada sudhaar he, to isamen lagaataar parivartan kyon karnaa padaa rahaa he
 On the claim that Kashmir stonewalling would reduce after demonetisation, Sinha vowed that if a woman is to have a child in the next Kashmir, shall we give a reason for demonetisation
 'bijepi ke kaaran kam nahin hue kachche telon ke daam'yashavanth sinha ne kachche tel ke daamon par kaha ki 2014 main bijepi ke satta main aate hi antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii keemat main giravat aa gai
 This decline was not due to us, but the price of crude oil rose to $ 29 per barrel
 notebandi ko lekar piem par nishananotbandi par sinha ne kaha ki is mulk main ek shahenshaah hua karata tha, jiskaa naam mohammad tughlaq tha, usne puraane paise band kiye the
 Sinha said that the ban on old notes was considered so important that PM Modi himself had declared black money and terrorism while announcing it, the pm's speech did not mention digital economy and cashless anywhere
 notebandi se patharbaji kam hone ke daawey par tanjapiem modi kii ore ishaara karte hue sinha ne kaha ki wo kehete hai notebandi kii vajah se kashmir main patharbaji khatm ho gai, lekin notebandi se pehle bhi patharbaji khatm ho gai thi
 If a child will be born to a woman in Kashmir, shall we say that it has happened due to demonetisation
 apni baat sahi tehraane ke liye kisi bhi had jaaenge kya
 GST Parsinha, 'thoughtlessly brought GST', said that it was described as the biggest economic reform since independence, if it is such a big reform, then why so many changes have to be made
 bina soche-samajhe jiesti laa diya gaya, iske liye jo form laayaa gaya he, wo itnaa mushkil he ki aam vyapaaree wo farm bhar bhi nahin saktaa
 Even after continuous improvement, they are not accepting their mistake
 vitt mantri badalane kii de chuke hai naseehatabataa den ki yashavanth sinha ne jiesti or usamen lagaataar ho rahe badlaav par kaha tha ki jiesti lagu karte vakt vitt mantri jetali ne apana dimag istemaal nahin kiya
 The way in which changes are being made on GST every day, the Prime Minister should change the Finance Minister for this

 The Aam Aadmi Party has not gained an edge in any of the 70 legislative assemblies, which is a proof that people have given priority to development
 kya vidhansabha chunaav main vah mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar honge, is sawaal par harshavardhan ne kaha ki 25 saal se 7 baar chunaav ladane or jeetne ke baad unako kya jimmedaari di jaaegi, yah har baar party ne hi tay kiya he
 Will try to live up to the responsibility that will be given in the future also
 harshavardhan kaha ki khud janata modi ji ko apana netaa maanate hue chunaav jitaana chaahati thi
 Confidence in Modiji was unwavering and the same result has been seen
 is baar ke chunaav main sabase khaas baat yahi thi

 unhone chunaav prachaar ke liye 12-12 ghante padayatra karne kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki kai-kai maheene tak aaraam karne kaa samay nahin miltaa

 loksabhaa chunaavon main 'modi kii tsunami' ne congress ko tabah kar diya he
 Just before the Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh, Priyanka Gandhi and Jyotiraditya Scindia, who came out of the Congress to cross the boat, failed completely
 chunaav main karaari haar ke baad rahul gandhi ne congress adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya he or abhi bhi apane faisle par adig hai
 Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said during the meeting with the leaders of the Youth Congress that he is sad that even after his resignation as the party president, some chief ministers, general secretaries, in-charge and senior leaders of the Congress-ruled states are being held accountable
 Did not realize it
 rahul kii is tippanee ke baad sawaal uthne lage hai ki uttar pradesh main congress kii karaari haar kii jimmedaari kya priyanka gandhi or jyotiraditya sindhiya lenge
 In fact, Priyanka Gandhi was made the General Secretary to strengthen the Congress at the ground level in Uttar Pradesh before the Lok Sabha elections
 saath hi purvi uttar pradesh prabharee kii jimmedaari bhi saunpi gai thi
 While Jyotiraditya Scindia was made in charge of West UP
 soobe kii 80 loksabhaa siton vaale uttar pradesh main congress 67 siton par chunaav ladi
 Some of the remaining 13 seats were where the party supported the other
 rahul gandhi kii adhyakshata main chunaav main utari congress rahul ke saath hi priyanka or jyotiraditya sindhiya ke sahare behatar parinaamon kii ummid kar rahi thi
 But the fact remains that the veterans had to face defeat and Rahul Gandhi lost the traditional seat to Amethi
 upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne raibareli main jeet hasil kar party kaa khaataa kholaa
 Only 4 Congress candidates were able to save their deposits in UP
 sonia gandhi ne jahaan raibareli se jeet hasil kii thi
 At the same time, Rahul Gandhi Amethi, Imran Masood Saharanpur and Sriprakash Jaiswal were the candidates from Kanpur who could save their bail
 uttar pradesh congress adhyaksh raaj babbar, purv videsh mantri salmaan khurshid, purv kendriya mantri arpyen singh, jitin prasad ke alaava nirmal khatri, nasimuddin siddiki or ajay raay jaise diggaj netaa bhi apni jamaanat bachaane main naakaam rahe
 In 10 places, there were Congress candidates who got less than 2 percent of the total votes cast
 uttar pradesh main congress kii itani buree haalat apatkaal ke daur main hui thi, jab 1977 main party kaa soobe main khaataa tak nahin khulaa tha
 This time the results in the Lok Sabha elections were not less than the Emergency

 mana ja rahaa he ki ye mulaakaat raashtrapati chunaavon se pehle vipakshi kheme ko ekajute karne kii nitish kii koshishon kaa hissaa he
 According to sources, Nitish spoke to Sonia on the possibility of fielding a common opposition candidate in the presidential election and cautioned her to avoid getting caught in the bjp's agenda for the 2019 election
 2019 se pehle mahagathbandhan kaa dry ran?is mulaakaat ke baad atakalein lagane lagi hai ki kya vipaksh raashtrapati chunaav main apana ummidavaar utaaregaa? or ye bhi ki kya ye prayaas vipaksh kii ore se 2019 chunaav ke liye mahagathbandhan kaa dry ran hoga? haalanki, isamen chunautiyaan bhi kai hai
 akhilesh-maya also said that after the defeat of UP, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati also talked about coming together and forming a grand alliance against Modi
 nitish kumaar bihar kii tarj par mahagathbandhan banane kii baat kehete rahe hai
 But here the question also arises that who will be the leader of the grand alliance? Will Congress lead Nitish in place of Rahul Gandhi? yaa phir jediu congress kii aguwai main mahagathbandhan main shaamil hogi
 What is the equation of the presidential election? 771 mps of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have a total of 5 lakh 45 thousand 868 votes
 jabaki puure desh main 4120 vidhayakon ke 5 lakh 47 hajaar 786 vot
 In this way, the total votes are 10 lakh 93 thousand 654 and for winning, one half more means 5 lakh 46 thousand 828 votes
 NDA kii kya he sthiti?loksabhaa main abhi endie ke paas 339 saansad hai or rajyasabha main 74 saansad hai
 Since the nominated mps do not vote in the presidential election, 337 mps of Lok Sabha and 70 mps of Rajya Sabha will vote
 ek saansad ke vot kaa mulya 708 hota he is hisaab se loksabhaa main endie ke 2 lakh 38 hajaar 596 vot hai or rajyasabha main endie ke 49 hajaar 560 vot hai
 That is 2 lakh 88 thousand 156 votes of NDA mps
 iske alaava vidhansabha se vot padenge
 Obviously the Modi government will have to garner this much support
 vipaksh yahi chot karnaa chahta he
 It is fine to talk about the Grand Alliance but these 5 big obstacles are also in its path

 rajyon main aapas main bhidin partiyon kaa kya hoga? bengal main congress-trinmul congress-left kis had tak saath aaenge
 Will DMK-AIADMK come together in South? Will the sp-bsp-congress-rld come together in UP? 4
 Apart from Modi opposition, what will be the factors? The concept of grand alliance is fine, but will this grand alliance only go against the Modi factor among the public
 5
 How will the equation of the alliance be decided at the ground level? In the name of the grand alliance, if more than two dozen parties become one, then how much their workers will come together, this factor will also be important
