 bhartiya rajdoot sharat sabharwal ne pakistan ke grih mantri rahamaan malik se mulaakaat kii or mumbai hamale ke jaanch kii sthiti par unase charchaa kii
 Indian Ambassador to Pakistan Sabharwal took the latest report from Malik on Pakistan's probe in connection with the terrorist attack in Mumbai on 26 November last year
 hamale main 180 se adhik log maare gayi the
 The meeting comes against the backdrop of release from the detention of Hafiz Mohammad Sayeed, the founder of Lashkar and head of jamaat-ul-dawa and a suspected conspirator of the Mumbai attack
 gauratlab he ki malik or sabharwal kii yah mulaakaat rus main ek sammelan ke itar pradhanmantri manmohan singh or pakistan ke raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari ke bich hone vaali mulaakaat se sirf teen din pehle hui he
 Immediately after Saeed's release, India expressed deep displeasure over this and said that this raises serious doubts on Pakistan's intention to take serious action against terrorist groups operating from Pakistani soil
 sarkaar kii ore se kul 217 karod din manzur kiye gaye he or is hisaab se kul kharch (217x238) 51646 karod rupee baithta he
 If we add the last year's outstanding of Rs 12000 crore to this expenditure, then the government needs a total of Rs 63,646 crore for the whole year, but its total allocated budget is only Rs 38,500 crore
 yani sarkaar ko jinata paisa manaregaa skim ko abhi kii manzuri ke hisaab se chalaane ke liye chahie hoga, usase (63, 646- 38, 500) 25146 karod rupee kii kami he

 olerounder kii samasya kaa samaadhaan hardik pandya kii tabadatod ballebaazi ke baad ho chukaa he
 At number 9, Ashwin reflects the team's batting prowess
 spin gendbaaji main aswin-jadeja ke saath raina, yuvaraj ke vikalp maujuud hai or finisher kaa role dhoni-raina jaise ballebaaz nibhaayenge, lekin ek sawaal jo ab bhi barkaraar he, wo yuvaraj kii ballebaaji ko lekar he, jis par khud captain dhoni ne kaha he ki wo sidhaa aate hi chakke-chauke nahin laga sakate
 He is a batsman who can hit long hits, but it takes him some time to settle down
 tippaniyan Also, Dhoni also said that Yuvraj does not fit in the top four at this time
 salaami ballebaajon ke baad viraat hai, phir raina or wo shandaar form main hai
 In such a situation, Yuvraj will have to bat only after him
 matlab saaf he, captain dhoni ne vishwa cap kii plaing ilevan tay kar lee he or maujuuda team main viraat ke aane par rahane ko baahar janaa hoga
 In such a situation, if you send Yuvraj up the batting order in place of captain Rahane, then there will be no surprise
 vishakhapatnam main siries kaa nateeja tay hoga or captain dhoni jo zyada badlaav karne ke liye nahin jane jate wo kya vishwacap ke maddenjar negi jaise khilaadi ko mauka denge, ye dekhnaa dilachasp hoga
 In spin bowling, there are options for Raina, Yuvraj with ashwin-jadeja and Finisher's role will play batsmen like dhoni-raina, but one question that still remains is about the batting of Yuvraj, to which Captain Dhoni himself said Is that they cannot hit sixes and fours as soon as they come straight
 wo aise ballebaaj hai, jo lambey hit laga sakate hai, lekin settle hone main unhen kuch samay lagata he
 The comments saath hi dhoni ne ye bhi kaha ki yuvaraj is samay top four main feet nahin hote
 After the openers are Virat, then Raina and they are in excellent form
 aise main yuvaraj ko unke baad hi ballebaaji kerani hogi
 Meaning clearly, captain Dhoni has decided the playing eleven of the World Cup and Rahane will have to go out if Virat comes in the current team
 aise main agle match main agar captain rahane kii jagah yuvaraj ko ballebaaji kram main upar bhej den, to koi chaunkane vaali baat nahin hogi
 The result of the series will be decided in Visakhapatnam and it will be interesting to see if captain Dhoni, who is not known to make much changes, will give a chance to a player like Negi in view of the World Cup

 jo main logon ko dikhaa sakati hum

 smriti ne bataaya, meri jindagi kaa sabase yaadgaar pal wo he, jab amethi raily main modi ji ne mujhe apni choti bahan kaha tha
 Smriti expressed her confidence in Modi and said, "the day Modi asks me to step down as minister, i will happily resign from the post the same day
" lekin modi kii shubhakamanaayen hameshaa mere saath rahengi
 Smriti said that i had become emotional after Modi's sister address during rallies, i had no idea of modi being emotional
 smriti ne summit ke dauraan kaha, modi ji mujhe choti bahan bulaate hai, par main kabhi bhi modi ji ko nijee taur par nahin jaanati thi
 i always met him only with projects
 lekin modi ji ke saarvajanik taur par mujhe bahan maanane ke baad aksar main us pal ko yaad kar bhavuk ho jaati hum
 Praising Modi, Smriti said, Modi knows who works in his government and who only tries to keep him happy
 modi hamaare bolne ke dhang kii bajaay hamaare kaam ko dekhte hai

 When we used lathi in our rallies, it was the support of Mahatma Gandhi to walk like sticks

 ”yah bayaan argedy ke kisi manje hue rajaneta kaa nahin, balki us yuva kaa tha jo pita kii rajnatik viraasat sanbhaalane ke liye qamar kas chukaa he
 During the rjd's reign, the media was not allowed to ask uncomfortable questions to Lalu Prasad Yadav, but now the media dared to ask such questions which were quite annoying to the RJD leaders
 aisa hi ek sawaal tha—kya raily main aane vaale is baar bhi lathi lekar aaenge, jaisaa unhone april 2003 main lalu kii lathi raily main kiya tha
 The big leaders of RJD could not think of any answer to this sarcastic question
 lekin tabhi lalu ke chote bete tejasvi yadav ne dakhal dete hue jo jawaab diya, usase vahaan khadey netaaon kaa bhi hairaan hona lajimi tha
 24-year-old Tejashwi, wearing a light beard, short hair and now a kurta-pajama with a collar just like his father, gave full details of lathicharge on people in Nitish Raj
 ganwai andaaj or chutile bayanon ke liye charchit rahane vaale lalu ke bete ke is peshewar andaaj ne puraane dharre par raajnneeti karne vaale netaaon ko bhaunchak kar diya
 Tejashwi Lalu, who studied in Delhi Public School in the country's capital, has eight children - seven daughters and two sons
 ve maanate hai ki unhone rajnatik samaj hasil karne ke liye kadi mehnat kii he
 He says that he has matured only with the help of senior leaders
 blueberi handset istemaal karne vaale tejasvi apana mobile number dete hue kehete hai, ''main sabaki baat sunata hum

 ”aaj tejasvi congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke bahut bade prashansak hai or chaara ghotaale main lalu ko sajaa hone ke baavjood unhone party ke anya netaaon ke saath hi khud ko niyantrit rakhaa he, jabaki argedy netaa congress par hamalaa karne ke liye betaab ho rahe the
 They defend the rjd's support to the Congress, although the Congress is supporting the Nitish government in Bihar
 umr ke lihaaj se ve abhi loksabhaa yaa vidhansabha chunaav ladgaye ke yogya nahin hai, lekin tejasvi ko andaja he ki lalu ke jail main hone se congress par hamalaa karnaa nuksaandeh sabit ho saktaa he
 Tejashwi was only eight years old when Lalu first went to jail in July 1997, leaving the post of Chief Minister of Bihar
 ve yaad karte hue kehete hai, ''bahut kathin daur tha
 My parents sent me to Delhi to study to keep me out of trouble
 ” lekin is baar lalu jab jail gaye to tejasvi majbootee se unke peeche khadey rahe, maano puraane dinon kii bharpai kar rahe hon
 Lalu trusts Tejashwi more than his elder son Tej Pratap
 lalu 30 sitambar ko sibiai adaalat ke faisle se ek din pehle jab ranchi gaye to tejasvi ko hi apane saath le gaye the
 He was the only member of the stunning family in Ranchi
 lalu jaanate the ki tejasvi hi unki bhaawanaaon ko kaabo main kar sakate hai
 On the day of the verdict, Tejashwi quickly came out of the court and informed mother Rabri Devi about the decision on the phone
 phir waapas aae or pita ke kandhe par haath rakhkar unhen dhankos bandhaaya
 When Lalu was taken to jail, Tejashwi responded nap-tula, the court's decision would be challenged in the upper court
 haalanki rajyasabha saansad ram kripal yadav jaise netaaon kii ankhon main aansu the, lekin tejasvi ne apni bhaawanaaon par puraa niyantran rakhaa
 RJD has come a long way in the last three years after Tejashwi's entry into politics
 argedy ke puraane dinon main lalu computer or information technology kaa majaak udaaya karte the, lekin ab unki party kii website ban chuki he, jise niyamit rup se apadet kiya jaataa he
 Tejaswi has some computer-savvy friends who help him to schedule visits, update rjd's Facebook profile and send messages
 raajnneeti main kadam rakhane se pehle tejasvi ne cricket kii pich par kismat aajamaai thi
 For Delhi, he played many matches for the Under-19s
 lekin ipiel main dairedevills kii ore se chune jane ke baad bhi unhen kabhi balla aajamaane kaa mauka nahin mila
 On this, Lalu had strongly cursed DDCA President and BJP leader Arun Jaitley, "my son got a chance to feed the players on the field only once, he was not allowed to play
" ” khud tejasvi is berukhi se khafa the
 But now his challenge is to prove himself on the pitch of caste-ridden Bihar politics, where he has got an exciting opportunity because of his father's legacy
 haalanki raajnneeti main tejasvi kii shuruyaat bahut niraashajanak rahi he
 In September 2010, Lalu took him for the first time in one of his press conferences
 raajnneeti main unka yah pehla kadam tha
 Tejashwi campaigned for Ma Rabri Devi and some other leaders in the 2010 assembly elections, but the party suffered a crushing defeat in that election and reduced its seats from 54 to just 22 in the 243-member assembly
 rabari ne do siton par chunaav ladaa tha, lekin donon par haar gayi

 ”apane bade bhai 26 varshiya tej pratap ke vipareet tejasvi jamini str ke kaaryakramon main dilchaspee lete rahe hai
 Tej sometimes participates in student politics
 party ke ek senior netaa kehete hai, ''laluji ko apane chote bete main apni chhavi dikhaai detii he
 Tejaswi also looks after the work of the youth wing of the party
 pehle hi 20 jilon main sakriy rahane ke baad ab jaldi hi ve apni yatra kaa aglaa charan shuru karenge
 "he is emerging as Lalu's successor at a time when Nitish Sarkar's popularity is at stake
 argedy kii virdohi bijepi or jedy-you main chhattis kaa aankada ho gaya he or voton ke is bantwaare se argedy ko sabase zyada phayda ho saktaa he
 Apart from this, due to sympathy with Lalu's punishment, his supporters may unite
 baharhaal, is samay tejasvi ke saamne sabase badi chunauti pita kii gairmaujuudagi main apni party ko sakriy rakhana he
 They can attract young voters from Bihar
 in yuva votaron main bahut badi sankhya pehali baar vot dene waalon kii he
 Although Lalu Yadav's voters wholeheartedly consider Tejashwi as his successor, but senior party leaders do not want that
 tejasvi baar-baar kah rahe hai ki lalu hi party ke sarvesarva bane rahenge
 On the other hand, Rabri too has backed down from the claim of taking over the leadership of the party
 loksabhaa main argedy ke teen saansad—raghuvansh prasad singh, prabhunath singh or jagadanand singh—bahut senior hai, jo shaayad hi tejasvi ko party pramukh kii bhoomika main sweekaar karenge
 Tejashwi also understands this, so for the moment he has confined himself to the youth wing
 lekin ve dirghakaalin yojana par kaam kar rahe hai
 Tejashwi also wants to assure that there is no rift in the family regarding succession
 ve kehete hai, ''lalu ji hamaare netaa hai
 However, there is a buzz in political circles that Lalu's beloved daughter Misa can also contest the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 tejasvi apane pita kii tarah chutile jawaab dene main bhale maahir na hon, lekin ve svachh raajnneeti ke pakshdhar hai

 In response to the question, Scindia first said that he does not react to anyone's statement

 The situation of the party should be improved by taking stock and it is the need of the hour

 kargil jang ne us sari badhat par pani pher diya, jo vaajapeyi kii lahore bas yatra kootneeti se hasil hui thi
 Despite his commitment to a lasting peace with Pakistan, despite Pakistan unexpectedly expressing his aggressive intent to occupy the Indian border, he did not stand in the way of war with Pakistan, but the invasion of Pakistan in Kargil in 1999
 , That too soon after Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's visit to Lahore and the signing of the Lahore Manifesto, surprising everyone Shri
 par sabase zyada khud vaajapeyi isse hairaan rah gaye the
 He was trying to understand the motives of Nawaz Sharif and Pakistan while consulting the proposals that took us to war

 After my briefing them and after the start of Operation Vijay on 23 May 1999 led by the three armies, they were convinced that Pakistan had betrayed them
 unhone elaan kiya ki "yah nai sthiti ghuspaith nahin thi balki bhartiya jameen par kabja karne kii pahal he
 All steps will be taken to liberate the area of kargil
 '' unhone sharif ko phone kiya or kaha ki "ham koi ghuspaith nahin hone denge
 
 
 Will get their land vacated by force
 ''june ke pehle hafte main vaajapeyi ne ek saarvajanik bayaan (duusari baar) diya ki bharat antarrashtriya seemaa yaa niyantran rekha (elosi) ko paar nahin karegaa; yahi sandarbh shart hamen di gai thi
 The statement also meant that our military strategy was tied up
 maine pradhanmantri ke saamne yah mudda uthaaya or guzarish kii ki yah baat saarvajanik taur par na kahen
 i said that the instructions of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) are being followed
 alabatta agar ham ghuspaithiyon ko baahar nahin nikaal pate hai, to sena ke paas niyantran rekha ko paar karne ke alaava koi chaara nahin hoga
 i asked that if we bring this request then, what will be your answer? Vajpayee did not respond then but in the evening, National Security Advisor Brajesh Mishra arranged for his interview with a TV channel
 isamen unhone kaha, "sarhad or niyantran rekha paar nahin karne kii baat aaj ke liye to thik he
 But we do not know what will happen tomorrow
 ''8 july, 1999 kaa din khaasaa ghatnapradhan tha
 The Prime Minister called me to his residence
 unhone mujhe bataaya ki pakistan apni senaaon ko niyantran rekha ke us paar apane hisse main waapas bulaane ke liye raji ho gaya he or is par ve meri pratikriya jaananaa chaahate the
 My immediate reaction was that this could not be accepted
 maine kaha ki sashastr balon ko kai jaane ganvaani padi hai
 Now that things have changed in our favor, why give the enemy a way to escape? a few hours later, i called again and i was called
 is baar unhone mujhase poocha ki baaki pakistani ghuspaithiyon ko khadedgaye main or kitna vakt lagegaa
 i said it could take two to three weeks
 phir unhone is baat kaa zikr kiya ki ham pehle hi kai jaane ganvaa chuke hai, kya hamen or jaane ganvaani chahie? maine unase kaha ki ham kisi or kii chhedi jang lard rahe hai
 The possibility of a few more deaths cannot be ruled out
 jo bhi ho, mujhe is mudde par apane sioessi (chif of stoff cameti) ke saathiyon se mashvira karnaa hoga
 Vajpayee also told me that according to the constitutional requirement, the country has to get the elections of Parliament also
 is bich maine sioessi ke saathiyon, vaais chif of di army staff or diarector general of military oparations (dijiemo) ko fouran baithak ke liye bulaayaa
 We talked about all the possible results and at the same time the DGMO spoke to the commander of the Northern Command over the phone
 kai sawaal uthaae gaye—kya hamen pakistani phujon kaa waapas lautne kaa prastaav maan lenaa chahie? agar haa, to iske siyaasi or sainya nattejey kya honge? vaapasi ke dauraan pakistani fujen kis tarah pesh aaengi? hamen achaanak kisi ghatnaon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he or unase nibatane ke liye hamen khud ko kaise taiyaar karnaa chahie?tab tak siyaasi halaat badal chake the
 Had we continued the war, he could have lost the international and domestic support that we had gained
 jang main jab siyaasi makasad hasil kar liye jate hai to use jari rakhane kaa matlab nahin rah jaataa
 We deeply suspected that the Pakistani army would withdraw
 un par bharosa kiya nahin ja saktaa tha
 After a long conversation we agreed that we could accept the phased withdrawal of Pakistani forces according to our time and priority
 us shaam jab mujhe piem awaas par teesri baar bulaayaa gaya, to maine apni siforishein or sharten unhen bataa deen
 They accepted this status quo

 (with IANS and ANI input) TRAI kaa nayaa niyam lagu ho chukaa he or soshal media par kuch yugers ab bhi apni pareshaaniyaan bataa rahe hai
 trai's new rule regarding DTH has been implemented with the aim that users will be able to control TV channels
 iske saath hi isse saste hone kii ummid jaagi
 But for many people this rule seems to be going backwards
 TRAI kaa maananaa he ki isse customers kaa bill kam ho jayega, kyonki customers sirf unheen channels ke liye paise denge jise wo dekhnaa chahenge
 Although not for many such people
 global analitics or reating company Crisil ke anumaan ke mutabik telecom athurity of india (TRAI) dwaara lagu kiye gaye is DTH niyam se customers ko ab pehle se zyada paise dene pad sakate hai
 By adding the base pack, add ons, network capacity fee and taxes, the customers' bill can come more than before
 aisa is reating agency kaa anumaan he or bataaya ja rahaa he ki TRAI ke vaade se ulti sthiti ban sakati he or customers kaa bill bad saktaa he
 Under the new regulation of TRAI, broadcasters have priced with a lot of strategy
 zyada popular or rich vaale channels kii keemat zyada hai
 Some popular channels cost 19 rupees and if you choose 10 channels like this, your bill may come more than the earlier pack
 Cirsil ke senior diarector sachin gupta ne kaha he, ‘is regaullation ke prabhaav ko lekar hamaari analisis ye dikhaati he ki manthali tivi bill par asar pad saktaa he
 Monthly bill may increase up to 25 per cent depending on the current pricing
 pehle 230-340 rupee tha to ab 300 rupee prati maheene ho saktaa he jo vyler 10 channel opt karte hai
 However, if you take 5 channels, the price will be reduced '
 is nae niyam kii vajah se customers ko zyada paise dene ke baad bhi kam channel mil rahe hai
 Niche Cart Basis definitely gives you a discount on which channels you want to watch and for whom
 lekin duusari tarah dekhen to number or channel kaaphi kam ho jaaenge or chwwis kam ho jaaegi opshans bhi kam honge

 At an event, Asaduddin Owaisi said, "tell me how many of the Bharat Ratna awards have been given to Dalits, tribals, Muslims, poor, upper castes and Brahmins?" He said that Baba Saheb was given Bharat Ratna
 It was also given not in the heart but in a condition of helplessness

 Let us know that on the eve of Republic Day, on behalf of the Government of India, former President Pranab Mukherjee, Dr
 bhupen hajarika or nanaaji deshmukh ko bharat ratna dene kaa elaan kiya gaya tha
 This award of Bharat Ratna is the highest civilian honor of the country, which is given for unshared national service
 
 
 
 And who raised the question is that the Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge had also questioned the Bharat Ratna earlier
 unka kahana tha ki ek gayak or ek shaks jo RSS kii vichaardhaara kaa prachaar karata tha use bharat ratna diya gaya he, yadi aap inaki tulana karen, to sivakumar swami ji ko aword milanaa chahie tha
 Ramdev asked - Why did the saints not receive the honor, besides Mallikarjun Kharge, Yogguru Baba Ramdev also said why no Hindu saint was given Bharat Ratna in the last 70 years
 unhone kaha ki agar madar terresa ko bharat ratna se sammanit kiya ja saktaa he to maharishi dayanand or swami vivekanand ko ye puraskaar kyon nahin milanaa chahie
 Aam Aadmi Party leader Sanjay Singh had said that Bharat Ratna was given to Pranab Mukherjee that once go to the Sangh branch and become Bharat Ratna
 sanjay singh kaa kahana tha ki bijepi ne bharat ratna kaa majaak bana diya he

 rajdhani dilli main sam or visham sankhya ke number plate vaale vaahanon ko lekar shuru hui bahes ke bich ye yaad karnaa ahm rahegaa ki aisi kabhi koshish mahanagari mumbai main bhi hui thi, jo ki safal na ho saki
 Due to this, the traffic of Mumbai kept improving
 ek janhit yachika kii sunwaayee karte hue bombai hoicourt ke aadesh par tatkaaleen parivahan sachiv vinay mohan laal kii adhyakshata main san 2000 main bani kamity ne kaha tha ki mumbai main somvaar se shuukravaar tak number plate ke aadhaar par trephic niyantrit ho
 Cars 1 and 2 on Monday, 3 and 4 on Tuesday, cars whose numbers are finally on the carts will not be able to walk on the roads
 is tarah se 1 se 0 number aakhir main hone vaali gadiyon kaa hafte ke paanch dinon main vibhaajan hoga
 This rule will not be applicable on Saturdays and Sundays and public holidays
 niyam sarkari chhod sabhi nijee or dupahiyaa vaahanon par bhi lagu hoga
 Apart from this, more money will have to be paid for taking the car in peak time in crowded areas
 lekin, isamen se ek bhi suzav amal main aa na sakaa
 Retired IPS Dr
 PS Pasricha has been a member of the Lal Committee
 ve khud trephic ke masale par phd kar chuke hai
 He told NDTV India that the committee made its recommendations before the High Court
 jis par court ne tatkaaleen sarkaar se poocha or sarkaar ne laal samiti kii sifarish nahin maani
 Due to this, changes in Mumbai's traffic could not be possible
 tippaniyan There was then a congress-ncp government in Maharashtra, which could not muster the courage to implement these recommendations
 agar yah suzav lagu hota mumbai mumbai jaise dakshin se uttar disha main faile shahar main 20% trephic kam ho jaataa
 Experts say that now such an expectation has survived only by strictly implementing some changes
 yatayaat maamle ke jaankaar ashok daataar kaa kahana he ki, behatar public transport aap de bhi den to basen chalaane ko sadak kahaan bachi he? aabaadi se zyada tezi se parking ke liye sadak par jagah-jagah kabza ho rahaa he
 Therefore, it is necessary to control the number of private trains
 lekin is baat ko kehane kii himmat kisi sarkaar main nahin
 Leave it to do daataar kaa daawa he ki, mumbai main aabaadi na ke baraabar bad rahi he, lekin 13 fisadi kii dar se badhate nijee vaahan parking kii jagah 30 fisadi kii gati se khatm kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, while waiting for change, nitrogen in Mumbai's climate has doubled in the last decade
 maharashtra pradooshan niyantran mandal kii report yah bataa chuki he
 While hearing a PIL, on the order of Bombay High Court, the committee headed by the then Transport Secretary Vinay Mohan Lal in 2000 had said that traffic should be controlled in Mumbai from Monday to Friday on the basis of number plate
 somvaar ko 1 or 2 to, mangalvaar ko 3 or 4 number jin kaaron ke numberplate par aakhir main hai, wo gaadiyaan sadakon par nahin chal sakengi
 In this way, the number 1 to 0 will be split at the end of five days a week
 shanivaar or ravivaar or saarvajanik chhuttiyon ke din ye niyam lagu nahin hoga
 The rule will also apply to all private and two-wheelers except government
 iske alaava bheed bhare ilaakon main peak time main gaadi le jane par zyada paise dene honge
 However, not a single suggestion could materialize
 ritred ipies dow pies pasrichaa laal kamity ke sadsy rah chuke hai
 He himself has done phd on traffic issues
 unhone NDTV india se baatcheet main kaha ki samiti ne apni siforishein hoicourt ke saamne rakhin
 On which the court asked the then government and the government did not accept the recommendation of the Lal Committee
 isse mumbai kii trephic main badlaav mumkin nahin ho sake
 The comments maharashtra main tab congress-ensipi kii sarkaar thi, jo in siforeeshon ko lagu karne kii himmat nahin juta saki
 If this suggestion were implemented, a city like Mumbai, which is spread from south to north, would have reduced the traffic by 20%
 jaankaar kehete hai ki ab aisi ummid keval kuch badlaav sakhti se lagu karne se hi bachi he
 Traffic expert Ashok Datar says that even if you give better public transport, where is the road left to run buses? Roads are being occupied for parking faster than the population
 isliye nijee gadiyon kii sankhya par niyantran jaruri he
 But no government has the courage to say this
 karnaa to chhod hi dijie
 Datar claims that while the population in Mumbai is growing at a negligible rate, private vehicles growing at the rate of 13 per cent are phasing out parking space at 30 per cent
 aise main badlaav kaa intjaar karte-karte mumbai kii aabhohawaa main nitrogen kii maatra pichley dashak main dugani ho chuki he

 desh ke 29wein rajya ke rup main telugana do june ko astitv main aayega or usee din se nae rajya ke rup main kaamkaaj shuru kar degaa
 The Home Ministry spokesman said here on Tuesday night that the establishment day of this new state will be June 2
 us din telugana astitv main aa jayega or pruthak rajya ke rup main kaam karnaa shuru kar degaa
 The central government has already issued a gazette notification on the formation of this 29th state of the country
 sansad ne andhrapradesh kaa vibhaajan kar nae telugana rajya banane ko 20 farvari ko manjuuri de di thi
 The declaration of the foundation day has come at a time when the Election Commission can announce the schedule of general election after just one day
 chunaav ayog telugana or baaki andhrapradesh ke vidhansabha chunaav ke liye pruthak kaarykram kii bhi ghoshnaa kar saktaa he
 Hyderabad will be the joint capital of the two states for ten years
 ravivaar ko kendriya mantrimandal ne simandhra ke liye paanch saal ke liye vishesh rajya kaa darja dene par apni sahmati di thi
 The Central Government's proposal for Seemandhra includes a six-point development package which includes tax concessions etc
 centre mukhyamantri en kiran kumaar reddy ke istife ke baad andhrapradesh main raashtrapati shashan bhi laga chukaa he
 Regardless of whether the mlas were inside the jail or outside, during the Rajya Sabha election on 30 March, they were in secret contact with the candidates and the power broker
 aisi kya vajah ho sakati he ki rajyasabha chunaav se dedh hafte pehle farji dastavej ke aadhaar par unhone darjanabhar se zyada emtis mobile ke sim card kharide or istemaal ke baad turant saboot mitaane ke liye unhen todakar phenk diya
 During the Rajya Sabha held on March 30, independent candidate builder Pawan Kumar Dhoot, who allegedly figured out a vicious way to approach the mlas and settle deals for votes, is enough to surprise the CBI officials
 pradesh main rajyasabha ke chunaav kharid-farokht ke aarope ke kaaran radd kar die gaye
 During the investigation, CBI got the important number (9135846806), which helped to reach many other numbers
 ise farji tareeke se hasil kiya gaya tha
 All these numbers were taken in the name of Yakub Ali, a hawkish doctor of the mandar
 lihaaja sibiai ne dhoot ke ek kareebi ramkumar bangar se poochtacha kii jiske bare main andeh kiya jaataa he ki usne hi yah sim dilwaaye the
 CBI has traced dozens of numbers taken on fake basis and along with call and SMS details, it helped CBI to understand which mlas and their associates were contacts of Dhoot
 sab kuch kaaphi saavdhaanee se kiya gaya taaki kisi ko isaki bhanak na lag sake
 The legislators also took care
 unhone in numberon se baatcheet karne ke liye apane number kii jagah apane rishtedaaron yaa apni patni ke number kaa istemaal kiya
 One of them includes Chamra Linda, an independent MLA from Visunpur who allegedly interacted and exchanged messages from three suspected MTS numbers 24 times between March 27 and 29 from his wife's mobile number
 ''ab jab baatcheet ho gaihai, nishcint rahen
 "this small SMS points to many facts
" pichley hafte sibiai ne linda ke ghar samet jharkhand, orissa, dilli or kolkata main 18 sthanon par chhapemari kii
 CBI also seized four mobile phones of Linda, whose call details are being extracted
 intelligence vibhaag ke ek adhikari bataate hai, ''ve daawa kar sakate hai ki phone par aadhyatm kii baaten kar rahe the
 But obtaining the number on the basis of fake documents, then breaking it and throwing it, talking to the secret number gives rise to suspicion of criminal conspiracy
 ''27 march ko savere saat baje se dopaher do baje ke bheetar linda ne apni patni ke number se emtis ke do numberon (jisaki aakhri do sankhya 69 or 87 he) par chah baar lambii baatcheet kii
 On March 28, at number 69, Linda spoke 15 times
 29 march ko linda ne emtis ke teen alag-alag number se tadake 3
 Called three times from 47 am to 12 noon
 linda isse inkaar karte hai ki unhone kabhi bhi dhoot yaa unke kisi sahyogi se baat bhi kii thi
 He says, "these things of conversation on wife's number are concocted
 main public life main hum
 i talk to a lot of people
 main aisi kisi sajeesh kaa hissaa nahin tha
 "linda's claims do not stand up to the evidence
" agar yah lalita linda koi or hai to yah sanyog bhi ho saktaa he ki vidhayak kii patni kaa naam bhi lalita he
 It cannot be a coincidence that the address given in the affidavit filed by Chamra Linda during the 2005 assembly election and Lalita Linda's address for mobile connection are the same: Doria Toli, Naya Sarai, Ranchi
 in numberon ke madhyam se takreeban ek darjan vidhayak dhoot ke sampark main rahe the
 Dhoot was voted first preference by more than a dozen mlas
 bataaya jaataa he ki chunaav lard rahe kuch pratyaashiyon ne vot kii kharid-farokht ke liye itani suniyojit vyavastha kii thi ki ve jail main band vidhayakon se bhi phone par lagaataar sampark main the
 An MLA from Jharkhand Mukti Morcha called another MLA in Ranchi's Birsa Munda Central Jail during the election while mobile jammers are in this Ranchi Central Jail

 choudhary kehete hai, ''ham kisi nattejey par pahunchen iske liye ham saare sutron or sabooton ko baariki se dekh rahe hai
 We will soon get to the bottom of the matter

 Justice Katju left the NDTV interview incomplete when asked why he took up the case after 10 years
 justise katju kaa daawa he ki upie sarkaar ko girane se bachaane ke liye ek bhrasht jaj kaa pramotion kiya gaya tha
 According to Justice Katju, when he was a District Judge, many Madras High Court judges had made adverse comments about his functioning, but the then Chief Justice of the Madras High Court removed all the adverse remarks in one stroke with the power of his pen
 And these judges became additional judges in the High Court

 This judge had the support of a prominent leader of Tamil Nadu, as this judge never granted him bail

 justise katju kaa kahana he ki unhen hairaani tab hui jab us par karrwai kii bajaay adishnal jaj ke taur par unke kaarykaal ko ek saal ke liye or badha diya gaya
 Justice Katju says that the Supreme Court's collegium had sent a recommendation to not appoint that judge further on the basis of the IB report, but a Tamil Nadu party supporting the government strongly opposed the recommendation
 And ministers of that party also threatened Manmohan Singh to topple his government
 bharat ke purv chif justise or ab rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog ke chairman justise keji baalkrishnan ne is maamle par pratikriya di he
 He says that i made the judge permanent after the recommendation of the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court

 lekin upie shasankaal main kanoonmantri rah chuke hansraj bharadwaj ne katju ke bayaan par sahmati jataate hue kaha ki gathbandhan main dabaav hota he
 At the same time, sources were quoted saying that the central government does not want to react to Justice Katju's statement

 At the same time, the government has also questioned the timing of raising this issue

 Varun Gandhi and his team pass through a pit-paved road in the rural area of sultanpur, while the signboard of the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana looks like a mockery of the scheme
 34 varshiya bijepi mahasachiv kaa kareeb aadha darjan esayuvi or jipon kaa kafila sultanpur kasbe se palia gaanv kii ore ja rahaa he, kyonki aaj varun kii duusari chunavi sabha hone ja rahi he
 This is the fourth day of a five-day electoral tour in his new constituency
 yahaan 7 may ko chunaav hona he
 By the end of the day, they would have held election meetings in 16 villages
 pilibhit ke is maujuuda saansad ne rajnatik rup se sabase mahatvapurn rajya uttar pradesh kii rajdhani lakhanu ke kareeb or nehru-gandhi parivaar ke garh raibareli or amethi se sate sultanpur ko apana nayaa thikaana banaaya he
 Their convoy passes through the narrow streets of Palia and stops at a place where a platform has been built
 varun driver ke bagal vaali seat se haath jode hue utarate hai or kuch yuvaaon ke bich se aage badhate hai, jo 'varun gandhi jindabad’ or 'bhartiya janata party jindabad’ ke naare laga rahe hai
 He has put saffron Gandhi caps on which are written the slogans of "modi for PM"
 modi ke naare vaali kesaria gandhi topi apane aap main virodhabhasi lagati he
 But the same is true because he is the grandson of Indira Gandhi on the one hand and the leader of the BJP on the other
 ve utsahit bheed ko sambodhit karte hue kehete hai, ''main yahaan sirf chunaav jeetne ke liye nahin aayaa hum, balki aapako ek nai tarah kii raajnneeti dene aayaa hum
 i do not say that i will make the road of gold, but i am young and hardworking
 main aapke liye apni taraf se puri koshish karuunga
 "here he gives a speech of only four minutes
 ve somanaabhaar gaanv kii sabha main kehete hai, ''meraa naaraa he, “mujhe samarthan do or apana sahi adhikaar lo
 'india has gained nothing from hindu-muslim and caste politics
 ” gaanv-gaanv chunavi sabhaayen karte hue varun is baat kaa koi ullekh nahin karte ki unki party ke netritv vaali yaa pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi kii sarkaar unke liye kya karegi
 It would be ironic that while the BJP is hoping to become the largest party in the state riding on the Modi wave, Varun appears to be trying to swim opposite the stream and is playing bets in the name of his family
 unke pita sanjay gandhi ne 1980 main amethi se apana pehla chunaav jeeta tha
 Amethi was a part of Sultanpur district at that time
 puche jane par ve kehete hai, ''main shahar kii chunavi sabhaaon main modi or bijepi ke bare main bolta hum
 People in villages want a lasting relationship with their MP
 ” sultanpur se maujuuda saansad sanjay singh ne sansad main pahunchane ke liye rajyasabha kaa rasta le liya he or apni bivi amita singh ke liye congress kaa tikat hasil kar liya he
 When Varun leaves for the next election meeting, the local BJP officials tell him the caste equation of that village
 ve har gaanv main jane se pehle unhen aisi jaankaree dete hai
 "60 percent of Pal and 40 percent of Muslims are here," he says
 ”varun pilibhit se yahaan aane kii vajah bataate hai, ''main aisa loksabhaa kshetra chahta tha, jahaan se meraa bhaavnaatmak judaav ho
 Pilibhit is my mother's seat
 ” 2009 ke chunaavon main varun ne sampradayik shortkat apanaaya tha or march 2009 main kathith rup se nafrat failaane vaale apane bhaashan se voton ke dhruvikaran ke baad aaraam se chunaav jeet gaye the
 a case was also registered against him for that speech, but was later dropped
 ve uttar pradesh se chunaav jeetne vaale party ke kuch gine-chune ummidavaaron main se the
 At that time BJP had got only 10 out of 80 seats here
 haalanki ve is baat se inkaar karte hai ki unhone kabhi nafrat failaane vaala bhaashan diya tha, lekin ve maanate hai, ''jab maine apana pehla chunaav ladaa tha to mujhe kuch log chadha rahe the, to kuch log khinch rahe the
 i was probably trying to please everyone
 ”ab ve apni chhavi banane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 He says, "for the first two years in Parliament i remained silent and busy in many cases to prove myself innocent
" aaj main mahasoos karata hum ki main har keemat par apane nijee vichaaron ke saath koi samajhaita nahin karuunga
 At the age of 20, Varun joined BJP like his mother Maneka Gandhi
 ve kehete hai, ''main apni maa ke liye vahaan janaa chahta tha
 “the new generation of the nehru-gandhi family was nothing short of a big gift to the BJP
 party haalanki unhen ek ke baad ek kai pad detii rahi, lekin un par kabhi puri tarah se bharosa nahin kiya gaya
 Recently, when Varun praised his cousin Rahul's self-help groups in Amethi, this mistrust was evident
 bijepi ne un par yah spasht karne ke liye dabaav daalaa ki ve rahul yaa congress kii tarif nahin kar rahe the
 But he did not criticize both
 sonia gandhi 2 april ko jis din raibareli se apana parchaa bhar rahi thim, usee din amethi kii tarif karke varun akhabaaron kii surkhiyon main aa gaye the
 If he was in Congress, it was not news
 nehru-gandhi viraasat or sangh parivaar ke bich fanse varun ko ab isi vaastaviktaa ke saath rahanaa he
 Election results are coming up in Karnataka and in such a situation BJP has reached near absolute majority

 What happened after that he had to commit suicide? - Did he have an official problem? Or was he struggling with domestic confusion? - Who was the last time he spoke before he died? - After all, why did no one hear his voice despite Rajesh Sahni being shot in the next room in the ATS office? Rajesh shot in the room, there are two doors in that room

 After all, why did the ATS colleagues not take him to the hospital immediately after he came to know about Rajesh Sahni's shooting? - Why was the doctor called from the private hospital for examination after being shot, while Lohia Hospital is nearby ? - Why was Rajesh Sawhney's deadbody lying in the ATS office for four hours? - Why are the officials stopping the driver who brought him a revolver from coming forward? - After such a mature person who committed suicide there Susait Note Why did not before? According to information, Rajesh Sawhney daughter recently was Admishn on the popularly Tata Institute in Mumbai

 ) eemaandaaree jis aam aadmi party kaa moolmantra he, agar us party main sadsy banane ke naam par farjeevada ho jaae, to kya kahenge
 In Bihar, fraud cases are coming up in the name of being made a member of the Aam Aadmi Party
 kai logon ko bina numberon kii raseed di gai, to kai logon ko ek hi number kii raseeden di gayi
 All this happened when a receipt of Rs 10 was given to make a member
 AAP eemaandaaree ke chaahe jitne daawey kar le, par inke bich hi maujuud logon ne mauka milte hi paison ke vaare-nyaare kar die
 Regarding this, AAP Bihar in-charge Somnath Tripathi said, "the mistake that was made was caught in the beginning
 chunki galat karne vaala apane hi bich kaa hoga, usne sochaa ki saadi raseed ja rahi he, to kyon na saadi raseeden ham hi na chhapava len
 
 
 Hearing these words from the mouth of Bihar in-charge of AAP, it seems that the party which wants to be synonymous with honesty, is being fake
 bihar main sadsyta hasil karne main jab 10 rupee kaa shulk lagata tha, tab farjivada hua
 There is no number on the receipt of Bisheshwar Rai, just the code of 014, which is for the whole of Bihar
 ek sadsyta raseed par naam sunil kaa he, number bhi he, par isi number kaa ek puraa bandal hi tha
 Hundreds of members were made from the same number
 jo sunil imaanadaaree dekhakar AAP kaa sadsy bana, vah khud ko thaga hua mahasoos kar rahaa he
 Actually, this forgery was operational since the campaign to create AAP members in every districts of Bihar with 10 rupees started
 dilli ke AAP daftar ne sirf 5 hajaar raseeden bhejin, par bihar main lakhon kii taadaat main ye raseeden chap gayi
 After the formation of the government, reports of AAP becoming members in number of thousands daily came from every district
 AAP bhi maan rahi he ki kai logon ne farji raseeden chhapavakar sadsyta abhiyaan chalaaya
 Two big leaders of the AAP believe that there was a mess in the name of running a membership campaign and people collected money as soon as they got the chance, which could not be accounted for
 duusari ore sadsyta abhiyaan chalaane vaale kah rahe hai ki ek paise kii bhi gadabadi nahin hui or sara paisa kahin-kahin rakhaa he
 When the Delhi authorities open the account, the entire money will be put into it
 patna main party ke magadh range ke secretary suryadev yadav ne kaha, 'dekhie ek pai bhi idhar se udhar nahin hua he
 People have started membership campaigns by printing receipts in different places and the same people have money
 jaise hi acount kii vyavastha ho jaaegi, usamen paise daal die jaaenge
 'actually many groups of AAP are working in Bihar
 sabhi gut khud ko asli aam aadmi party bataate hai
 In such a situation, how many receipts were printed and how many members were made, it is not known
 aise main kai jilon se farjivade kii khabaren ai hai
 Now let's see how the AAP deals with this fraud in Bihar

 Pakistan was already opposing the removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, now has come out in protest against another decision
 imran khan ne twit kar modi sarkaar or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Imran alleged that the bill is against the agreement between the two countries
 pakistani pradhanmantri imran khan ne twit kar likhaa, ‘bharat kii loksabhaa dwaara jo naagarikta bill paas kiya gaya he, uskaa ham virodh karte hai
 This law violates bilateral agreements and human rights law with Pakistan
 ye rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke hindu raashtra kaa agenda he jise ab modi sarkaar lagu kar rahi he
 'we strongly condemn Indian Lok Sabha citizenship legislation which violates all norms of int human rights law & bilateral agreements with Pak

 Union Home Minister Amit Shah has said that he is an Islamic country under the law of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, so there is no Muslim minority
 isliye unhen is bill main shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 It was also the first time that opposition to Article 370 is not the first time that such an objection has been made on any decision of India by Pakistan
 naagarikta sanshodhan bill se pehle bharat kii sansad ne anuchhed 370 ko hataane kaa faisla kiya tha, tab bhi pakistan ko aapatti hui thi
 Pakistan had raised the issue of Article 370 to the United States of America, although Pakistan was defeated everywhere on the diplomatic front

 Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin expressed disappointment over his bowlers scoring too many runs but at the same time expressed confidence that India's batsmen would also be able to score big in the third Test cricket match against Australia
 melbern test: duusare din kaa khel khatm, bharat- 108 / 1bharat ne shuukravaar ko australia kaa score paanch wicket par 259 ran kar diya tha lekin shanivaar ko uske gendbaaj acha pradarshan nahin kar paae
 The host team managed to score 530 runs
 iske jawaab main bharat ne duusare din kaa khel samaapt hone tak apni pehali pari main ek wicket par 108 ran banaae hai
 "we wanted to get him out as soon as possible," Ashwin said after the second day's play was over
 yah hamaari ranneeti thi
 Unfortunately Steven Smith batted very well
 unhone kaha, ve kaaphi ran banane main safal rahe lekin yadi aap puure match par dhyaan do to yah is pich par bahut bada score nahin he
 The wicket seems to have become slow and flat
 ham ek wicket par 108 ran se pari aage badhayenge or ham ravivaar ko bada score khadaa karne kii koshish karenge
 The Australian innings ended just before the tea break
 uski taraf se smith ne 192 ran banaae jabaki bread hadine ne 55 or reyaan haris ne 74 ran kaa yogadan diya
 Ashwin said of the Indian bowlers consistently bowling short pitches, "actually we believe that Haddin has that weakness
 ham ab bhi maanate hai ki yah uski kamajori he
 We will target him in the next innings and the next match too
 vah hamaare saamne bahut adhik sahaj najar nahin aata

 17 baar grand slam jeet chuke federr pichley saal french open nahin khel sake or lagaataar 65 grand slam khilne kaa record tham gaya
 He has not played in any tournament since Wimbledon's semi-final loss in July last year

 On his return, Federer said, "I wanted to play a little more in court, it was nice to come back

 Although the 35-year-old Federer is excited about his comeback, he is taking small steps

" ' a passenger plane of Egypt Airlines, carrying a total of 66 people, including 56 passengers, flies from Paris to Cairo, the Egyptian capital, on Wednesday night
 chaar ghante kii udaan main se 3 ghante 40 minute kaa safar puraa bhi ho jaataa he
 The floor is now just 20 minutes away
 par tabhi achaanak plane hawa main gum ho jaataa he
 Is this an accident? Hijacking? The act of a suicide terrorist on the plane or any other conspiracy from the ground to the sky? Egypt Airlines passenger plane Airbus-320 flies from the world's state-of-the-art airport to the city of Cairo, Egypt
 hawaii jahaaj main 2 payalat or 5 kru member samet kul66 musafir savaar the
 Egypt Airlines aircraft MS 804 had completed three hours and forty minutes by now
 is dauraan wo kai mulkon kii sarhadon or bumadhya sagar ke upar se udata hua misr kii hawaii seemaa main daakhil ho jaataa he or is tarah 3 ghante 40 minute kaa vakt guzar jaataa he
 Now this plane has only 20 minutes left to reach Egypt's land
 lekin tabhi bich aasmaan main kuch aisa hota he ki achaanak hi is airbas kaa misr ke air trephic control se sampark tut jaataa he or agle chand seconds main ye hawaii jahaaj raat ke andhere main samandar ke upar hawa main gum ho jaataa he
 Suddenly off the radar, how can a plane suddenly disappear over the sea in the sky? Is this any terrorist action? If yes, was there a bomb in this plane or did someone shoot it down? Is the airplane jacked high and made the victim of the accident? How many such questionable questions arise with the disappearance of this airplane in the air
 pehle cairo or phir paris ke charles di goule airport par hadakamp much jaataa he
 In air traffic control, there are situations of chaos
 logon ko samaj main nahin aata ki aakhir aisa kaise ho saktaa he
 How can a plane that was flying in the air a few seconds from now be suddenly off the radar? ab tamaam exparts kisi tarah plane se dobaaraa sampark sthapit karne kii koshish karte hai
 But all efforts go in vain
 barkaraar rahaa rahasyadonon mulkon ke airport par is hawaii jahaaj kii gumshudagi ko lekar maathapai hoti he ki kuch hi der main france ke raashtrapati francwa olande kaa ek bayaan saamne aa jaataa he
 When the President fights that there is no hope of getting the missing Airbus safe, he says that no theory can be dismissed about this disappearance
 matlab saaf he
 This can also be the result of an accident caused by technical fault and also of any terrorist action
 lekin raat ke andhere main hawa main gum is airbas kaa rahasy barkaar rahata he or har guzarate lamhe ke saath lagaataar gaharaa rahaa he
 The biggest question is, where did the entire plane suddenly go missing? The weather was clear at the place where the last contact of the airplane was broken by air traffic control
 yani haadase kii koi gunjaaish hi nahin thi
 There were also no technical defects in the plane till then
 kyonki payalat ne aisa koi sandesh nahin diya tha
 What happened then? Guessing to crash: Several teams are sent one by one to find the missing plane in the air from Egypt
 isamen egyptian armd force, si-130 or varning air craft bhi shaamil hai
 
 udhar, kai helicopter or duusare aircraft bhi rescue oparation ke liye taiyaar kar liye jate hai
 In view of the exaggeration of the occasion, search operation is also started by Egypt's neighboring country of Greece
 lekin iskaa koi phayda nahin hota
 However, an investigation team definitely finds some sailors who claim to see mysterious light over the midnight sea
 or isi ke saath misr ke naagarik uddyan daftar kii ore se ye ashanka jataai jaati he ki shaayad hawaii jahaaj bumadhya sagar main hi kahin krash ho chukaa he
 And with this, the hope of saving 66 people on the plane also ends

 This is the second accident of its kind this year with Egypt Air
 isse pehle isi airlines ke hawaii jahaaj ko march ke maheene main hijank kar cyprus tak le jaaya gaya tha
 After this, the security arrangements of the airlines were tightened
 jabaki isse pehle ek rusi hawaii jahaaj ko sinai penisula ke aasmaan par iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ne maar giraaya tha
 a total of 224 people were killed in that accident on 31 October 2015
 baad main chaanbin ke dauraan ye saaf hua ki us hawaii jahaaj ko aatmghaatee hamalaavaron ne ken bam ke jariye us hawaii jahaaj ko krash karavaaya tha

 Just a short while ago saw a very powerpack video of Bollywood actress and Tamil films superstar Shruti Haasan
 aap sabko lagegaa kuch phir hot-sexi tip rahaa hoga tabhi to powerpake kaha maine
 No! There was nothing like that but yes there was a lot that would definitely add you somewhere
 kuch dinon pehle kii baat he apane boyfriend se ek bahes ke dauraan maine khud ko Bitch shabd se sambodhit kar diya tha
 He was shocked when he heard these words because he felt how his girlfriend could say that
 ye to ek gaali he
 In a way, it is because these words are used for those who are bold, bold, cool
 ek shabd main kaha jaae to purushon ke paimaane par khari nahin utarane vaali auraten yaa ladkiyaan hoti hai
 Does that really happen? Of course it is all the more and this is how Shruti Haasan has told in a very bold way how Bitch actually means different in the eyes of a man and a woman
 agar ladki ne apakeprapojal ko na kahadia to wo Bitch he
 Someday if the boss reprimands you for any mistake, then it is Bitch
 is ke alaava agar koi actress kisi scanlad main fansi to bhi wo aapaki najaron main Bitch he
 This happened because all these women showed you the mirror of truth
 unki power aapse zyada thi or aap ise hajam nahin kar paae
 Girls should adopt this word now because neither it is abusive nor insult
 ye to ek powerful shabd he jo aapaki blodness,courage or Confidenceko duniya ke saamne laata he
 Hence Be a bitch and show your power to the World

 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee called up CPI (M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury on Sunday and a day after expressing her desire to work with her arch rival CPI-M on the Centre's move to clear big notes
 Urged to 'fight unitedly'

 'he said,' Those who are running their party through corruption in West Bengal should not talk too much about black money
 ' Mamata Banerjee on Sunday spoke to President Pranab Mukherjee on the Centre's move to stop the circulation of big old notes and said that representatives of political parties will meet them on the issue next week
 mamata banerjee ne twit kiya, 'mananeey raashtrapati meraa phone uthaane main paryaapt dayaalu rahe

 ' unhone twitor par likhaa, 'maine unhen raajnneetik dalon ke pratinidhiyon se 16 yaa 17 november ko milane ke liye raji hone par dhanyavad diya, jab ham unhen bhayankar sthiti se avgat karaayenge

 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Mohammad Salim, a member of the CPI (M) Polit Bureau, said, "yes, Mamata Banerjee talked to Sitaram Yechury and told him that all opposition parties should unite and stand against the BJP
" yechuri ne jawaab diya ki chunki vah yatra kar rahe hai, isliye vah party main is par charchaa karne ke baad hi maamle par tippanee kar sakenge
 ' saleem ne kaha, 'yah kol sharada or naarad ghotaalon main kathith taur par lipt trinmul ke netaaon ko bachaane kaa ek prayaas he

 There has been a rift in the Grand Alliance before the Bihar elections
 aaj samaajawaadee party ne khud ko is mahagathbandhan se alag kar liya
 Senior SP leader Ram Gopal Yadav, who has been called a 'think tank' of the SP, said that the leaders and workers of Bihar were feeling humiliated by the seats we were being given
 ham ek sammanjanak tareeke se apane balboote chunaav ladenge
 He said that "when the Janata Parivar has been united and i did not sign the party's death warrant at that time, neither the name of the party nor the sign was saved
" ' It will be remembered that in March this year, 6 political parties came together under the grand alliance
 haalanki aaj der shaam ise bachaane kii koshish hui, jab jediu ke varisht netaa sharad yadav mulaayam singh yadav ke yahaan, unase milane panhuche
 The SP is unhappy about getting 5 seats
 sampradayik takaton ke khilaaf jo yah kathith gathbandhan tha anjaam tak pahunchane se pehle hi charmara gaya
 Obviously, questions are arising as to why there is no coordination between these theoretically coming together politicians
 ramgopal bole 'koi dabaav nahin tha
 What we fear is a probe on Yadav Singh
 vah kiske kareeb rahaa he, aap bhi jaanate hai, ham bhi jaanate hai
 ' baharhaal pichley hafte hi mulaayam singh yadav kii pradhanmantri narendra modi se mulaakaat hui thi
 Today Ram Gopal Yadav refused to meet Amit Shah in a meeting
 lekin jaankaro kaa kahana he ki yah mulaakaat hui
 There is a discussion that Samajwadi Party was seeking 27 seats in Bihar, later the matter reached 17
 atakalein hai ki ab sapa bihar main 50 siton par apane ummidavaar utaar sakati he
 
 
 
 to iskaa phayda kisko hoga? jaankaron ke anusaar samaajawaadee party ke is kadam se bijepi ko phayda hoga or yah pehali baar nahin ho rahaa
 In the last Bihar elections, SP contested 146 out of 240
 sapa ne ek bhi seat nahin jiti thi, lekin usne bijepi virdohi vot ko bikher diya tha
 The effect was that the non-bjp parties had lost those seats
 samaajawaadee party ne yah ranneeti kuch or rajya chunaavon main bhi apanaai
 She contested in 22 in Maharashtra, 67 in Gujarat and 164 in Madhya Pradesh, where she won no seats
 haalanki bijepi ke ummidavaaron ko jeet mili mushkil se
 The comments ab sawaal uth rahaa he ki mulaayam singh yadav bijepi ke kareeb kyon aa rahe hai
 There are many reasons behind this
 2017 main uttarapradesh main vidhansabha chunaav he or rajya main kanoon vyavastha kii haalat dagamagaa rahi he
 There is growing discontent among the general public
 rajya main agar road haive banane hai to kendra ke saath samanvay kii jarurat he
 The Akhilesh government's Governor Ram Naik remains tense
 teen saal main 180 dange ho chuke hai, lekin sabase ahm mana ja rahaa he ki yadav sih par sibiai jaanch kaa maamla

 Or they want to come closer to power
 vah 2017 or 2019 ke chunaavon ke jariye kend main apane liye jagah talash rahe hai

 This will be clear in the coming days, but before the Bihar elections, Nitish Kumar has suffered a big blow today
 garmaate ja rahe hai bihar chunaav
 The communal forces against which this alleged coalition collapsed before reaching its end
 jaahir he sawaal uth rahe hai ki saidhantik rup se saath aa rahe in raajnneetigyon main kyon samanvay nahin ho paaya
 Ramgopal said, 'there was no pressure
 hamen kya dar he yadav singh par jaanch ho
 Who has he been close to, you know, we know too
 ' However, last week, Mulayam Singh Yadav met Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 aaj ramgopal yadav ne amit shah se mulaakaat se bhari sabha main inkaar kiya
 But experts say that this meeting took place
 charchaa he ki bihar main samaajawaadee party 27 siten maang rahi thi, baad main baat 17 par panhuch gai thi
 There is speculation that the SP may field its candidates in 50 seats in Bihar
 
 
 
 So who will benefit? According to experts, this step of Samajwadi Party will benefit BJP and this is not happening for the first time
 pichhali baar ke bihar chunaavon main sapa ne 240 main se 146 par chunaav ladaa tha
 The SP had not won a single seat, but had scattered the anti-bjp vote
 iskaa asar yah hua tha ki naan bijepi partiyaan vah siten haar gai thim
 The Samajwadi Party adopted this strategy in some other state elections as well
 maharashtra main 22, gujarat main 67 or madhyapradesh main 164 main vah chunaav ladi, jahaan usne koi seat nahin jiti
 However, the BJP candidates have barely won
 tippaniyan Now the question arises why Mulayam Singh Yadav is getting close to BJP
 iske peeche kai kaaran maane ja rahe hai
 Uttar Pradesh has assembly elections in 2017 and the law and order situation in the state is staggering
 aam janata main asantosh bad rahaa he
 If road highways are to be built in the state, then coordination with the center is needed
 akhilesh sarkaar ke rajyapal ram nik se tanatani bani hui he
 There have been 180 riots in three years, but the most important is believed to be the case of CBI investigation on Yadav Singh
 yadav singh noida atharity ke pramukh rahaa he
 Akhilesh government also promoted it
 1995 main project ejeeniyar banaaya, baavjood iske ki vah ejeeniyar nahin tha
 But the Allahabad High Court has ordered a CBI inquiry against him
 gauratlab he ki yadav singh ne 6 mukhyamantriyon or teen alag-alag sarkaron ke tahat apni ahmiyat banaae rakhi he
 So will Mulayam Singh Yadav agree with a big heart
 
 
 
 The top post of the Grand Alliance will be liked by them
 
 
 yaa phir satta ke kareeb ve aana chaah rahe hai
 He is looking for a place in the center through the 2017 and 2019 elections
 yah aane vaale dinon main saaf hoga, lekin bihar chunaavon se pehle nitish kumaar ko aaj tagada jhatka jarur lag gaya he
 Bihar elections are going hot baharhaal pichley hafte hi mulaayam singh yadav kii pradhanmantri narendra modi se mulaakaat hui thi

 garmaate ja rahe hai bihar chunaav
 In the last Bihar elections, SP contested 146 out of 240
 sapa ne ek bhi seat nahin jiti thi, lekin usne bijepi virdohi vot ko bikher diya tha
 The effect was that the non-bjp parties had lost those seats
 samaajawaadee party ne yah ranneeti kuch or rajya chunaavon main bhi apanaai
 She contested in 22 in Maharashtra, 67 in Gujarat and 164 in Madhya Pradesh, where she won no seats
 haalanki bijepi ke ummidavaaron ko jeet mili mushkil se
 The comments ab sawaal uth rahaa he ki mulaayam singh yadav bijepi ke kareeb kyon aa rahe hai
 There are many reasons behind this
 2017 main uttarapradesh main vidhansabha chunaav he or rajya main kanoon vyavastha kii haalat dagamagaa rahi he
 There is growing discontent among the general public
 rajya main agar road haive banane hai to kendra ke saath samanvay kii jarurat he
 The Akhilesh government's Governor Ram Naik remains tense
 teen saal main 180 dange ho chuke hai, lekin sabase ahm mana ja rahaa he ki yadav sih par sibiai jaanch kaa maamla
 Yadav Singh has been the head of the Noida Authority

 Now the question arises why Mulayam Singh Yadav is getting close to BJP
 iske peeche kai kaaran maane ja rahe hai
 Uttar Pradesh has assembly elections in 2017 and the law and order situation in the state is staggering
 aam janata main asantosh bad rahaa he
 If road highways are to be built in the state, then coordination with the center is needed
 akhilesh sarkaar ke rajyapal ram nik se tanatani bani hui he
 There have been 180 riots in three years, but the most important is believed to be the case of CBI investigation on Yadav Singh
 yadav singh noida atharity ke pramukh rahaa he
 Akhilesh government also promoted it
 1995 main project ejeeniyar banaaya, baavjood iske ki vah ejeeniyar nahin tha
 But the Allahabad High Court has ordered a CBI inquiry against him
 gauratlab he ki yadav singh ne 6 mukhyamantriyon or teen alag-alag sarkaron ke tahat apni ahmiyat banaae rakhi he
 So will Mulayam Singh Yadav agree with a big heart
 
 
 
 The top post of the Grand Alliance will be liked by them
 
 
 yaa phir satta ke kareeb ve aana chaah rahe hai
 He is looking for a place in the center through the 2017 and 2019 elections
 yah aane vaale dinon main saaf hoga, lekin bihar chunaavon se pehle nitish kumaar ko aaj tagada jhatka jarur lag gaya he

 Troubled by rising competition, declining stock prices and the lack of well-known Ambani dominance in the corridors of power, the two brothers are now trying for a secret deal to send a strong message to revive the market

 As of June 2005 and then May 2010, the bridge is produced this time by Kulmata Kokilaben Ambani, who has clearly stated to her sons that the time has come to reunite
 may 2010 main bhi kokilaben ne 'sari dushmani khatm karne' kaa aahvaan kiya tha
 At that time the two brothers agreed to cancel the agreement not to compete with each other, which was part of the agreement reached in 2005
 uske baad se ve ek-duusare ke vyavsaay ke daayre main pravesh karne ke liye swatantra the
 Now, within the boundary of their family residence, Sea Wind, in the Colaba area of mumbai, Kokilaben is asking them to take their relationship to the next level, in which both will be able to retain their independent corporate companies, but they are given one- It will be compulsory to cooperate with another

 Mukesh, who has been on a cash pile of $ 12 billion since the May 2010 deal with not competing, has unveiled aggressive plans to expand into the telecom, retail and financial services sectors - where Anil has traditionally been dragged on

 The rupee has continued to fall against the dollar in the international currency market
 guuruuvaar subah dollar ke mukaable rupaya 72 ke str ke paar pahunch gaya
 Experts claim that this fall in rupee is being seen due to global reasons
 kyon gir rahaa rupaya?america or china ke bich jari trade war or iske chalate vaishvik str par logon kaa dollar par badhata bharosa rupee kii is giravat ke liye sabase bade kaaran bataae ja rahe hai
 Globally, due to this trade war, the world's confidence in the dollar is constantly increasing and the dollar is going to be fiercely bought
 vahiin duniyabar main ubharate bazaaron kii mudraon ko nuksaan uthaanaa padaa rahaa he
 Experts also say that while the continued decline in Turkish currency lira has created a crisis for the currencies of the whole of Europe, the decline in the currencies of Europe has created a crisis for the emerging economies
 iske alaava vaishvik str par kachche tel kii keemton main jari teji bhi in arthvyavasthaaon kii mudraon ke liye gambhir chunauti pesh kar rahi he
 What harm to the common man? In the global market of rupee, the direct impact of the common man
 behad saral shabdon main is asar ko kaha jaae to bazaar main sab kuch mahangaa hone lagata he
 The fall in the price of rupee makes it expensive for the common man to spend holidays abroad, buy foreign cars, buy smartphones and study abroad
 iske chalate desh main mahangaai dastak dene lagati he
 Products of everyday need begin to be expensive
 aap kah sakate hai ki dollar ke mukaable rupee kaa lagaataar kamjor hone aam aadmi ke liye roti, kapadaa or makaan ko mahangaa kar detaa he
 Read this: The answer to these 5 questions will show that demonetisation has passed or failed? On the other hand, due to the depreciation of the rupee, home loan also becomes expensive for the common man
 lihaaja, saaf he ki jab dollar ke mukaable rupee main lagaataar giravat kaa daur jari he to yah vakt nae home lone lene kaa nahin he
 In addition, the country's imports become expensive due to the weak rupee
 aise vakt main jab kachche tel kii keemten pehle se hi sheersh str par chal rahi hai, kamjor rupaya sarkari khajaane par adhik boj daalata he or sarkaar kaa chaalu khaataa ghaataa bad jaataa he
 RBI has no option? The general perception is that Reserve Bank has an important role in the printing of rupee as well as trading the rupee in the global money market
 dollar ke mukaable rupee kii maujuuda giravat ko dekhte hue india today hindi ke sampadak anshuman tiwari kaa kahana he ki rigerv bank ke paas rupee kii chaal ko sanbhaalane ke liye ab koi vikalp nahin bachaa he
 Anshuman said that the present situation is also complicated because now even if the Reserve Bank takes some steps to save the rupee, it will not succeed because the rupee is completely dependent on the global situation, over which we have no control of the RBI or the government

 Economic experts believe that the government of that country has the biggest responsibility to operate the currency
 vahiin bhartiya rupee main jari giravat par bijness today ke sampadak rajeev dube kaa kahana he ki rupee ko aisi sthiti se bachaane ke liye kendra sarkaar ko desh main export ko badhaane ke saath-saath epadiai or epapiai main ijapha karana hoga
 According to Dubey, this work is not done in the current situation but during a long period
 yadi desh main aarthik susti kaa maahaul nahin hota ko rupaya dollar ke mukaable is sthiti main nahin fansaa hota
 Hence, to remove the rupee from the current situation, there is a need for large foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investment in the country along with a big increase in exports
 rajeev kaa maananaa he ki yadi in teenon front par sarkaar ne beete kuch varshon ko dauraan behatar kaam kiya hota to rupye maujuuda sthiti main nahin pahunchaa hota

 The son of a laborer has received an offer of nearly five crore from the world's renowned IT company Microsoft

 Resident doctors have returned to work in the state
 jodhpur ke atirikt sambhageeya ayukta gobind singh chaaran ne yah jaankaree di
 He said that the resident doctors went on strike in protest against the lathijarchs conducted by the police on resident doctors in Mathura Das Mathur Hospital of Jodhpur on Saturday night after a fight between resident doctors and the injured patient's family members
 jodhpur ke resident chikitsakon kii hadtaal ke samarthan main jaipur bikaner, udaipur, kota or ajmer medical kalege ke resident chikitsakon ke hadtaal par chale gayi the
 According to Charan, after the government issued orders to remove Jodhpur's Additional District Collector Sneh Lata Panwar and Additional Superintendent of Police Rajesh Singh from the present post and wait for posting, the Chairman of the Clash Committee of Resident Doctor of Jodhpur, Dr
 Ajay Malviya, called the strike
 Announced the withdrawal

 bharat ne antariksh kii duniya main badi uplabdhi hasil kii he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing the country on Wednesday afternoon at around 12
30 pm said that India has killed a satellite in space shortly before
 bharat aisa karne vaala duniya kaa chauthaa desh ban gaya he
 This mission in space was similar to the nuclear test conducted in Pokhran
 is pareekshan ke baad bharat ne ek baar phir duniya main apana loha manvaaya he
 Why this mission special? If scientists believe this successful operation of India is very important
 ajtak se baat karte hue vaigyanik arapy tandon ne bataaya ki ab bharat jal, nabh or thal ke alaava antariksh main bhi dushman kii harkaton par nazar rakh saktaa he
 That is, if an enemy country is tracking or spying on India through satellite in space, then India can destroy its own missile
 ye mishan puri tarah se mek in india he, yani is mishan ko isro or DRDO kii sahaayta se hi puraa kiya gaya he
 When the world was shaken by the Pokhran test
 
 
 is lihaaj se bharat kii ye uplabdhi utani hi badi he jitna purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kii aguwai main hua parmaanu pareekshan
 Even then, no country in the world was aware that India is preparing so much or even has done it
 or aaj bhi bilkul aisa hi hua he
 On 11 May 1998, 3 atomic bombs were successfully tested in Pokhran, Rajasthan, at the same time India became a nuclear nation
 newclear test kaa kaam parde ke peeche kiya gaya tha, taaki kisi ko khabar naa lag sake
 Even the US intelligence satellites were not aware of it
 ‘oparation shakti’ ke baad 'mishan shakti'tab pradhanmantri vaajapeyi ne isi tarah press conference kar isaki jaankaree di thi, jisase duniya chaunk gai thi
 Then many countries of the world had imposed restrictions on India
 haalanki, iske baavjood bharat sarkaar peeche nahin hati thi
 The special thing is that the name of that mission was 'operation Shakti'
 us mishan main ahm bhoomika nibhaane waalon main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ke alaava tatkaaleen raksha mantri jorge furnandis or raksha mantralay main salaahkaar vaigyanik apije abdul kalam bhi shaamil the
 What is the similarity between the two operations? - The name of this operation is 'mission Shakti', while the nuclear test mission in Pokhran was named 'operation Shakti'
 - tab bhi mishan puri tarah chupchaap kiya gaya tha or pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ne isaki ghoshnaa kii thi
 Even today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself announced this while addressing the country
 - bharat indira gandhi ke jamaane main hi parmaanu shakti ke taur par ubhara tha, lekin uske baad kisi sarkaar ne dobaaraa parmaanu pareekshan nahin kiya tha
 But the then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee expressed political will and decided to leave behind the opposition of the world
 - antariksh main hue mishan shakti main bhi aisa hi hua he, ise puraa karne main bharat 2012 main hi sakasham tha, lekin tab se ab tak koi nirnay nahin hua tha, lekin ab jaakar mishan puraa hua he
