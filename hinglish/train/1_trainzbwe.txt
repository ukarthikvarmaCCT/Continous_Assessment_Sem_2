 But the Delhi High Court has rejected the order of the Central Information Commission, believing that EVM is outside the purview of information

 com / c9octeskeh — Madhur Bhandarkar (@imbhandarkar) September 22, 2019 pichley mukaable main haar jhelane ke baad deccan chargers team indian premier lig (ipel) ke chauthe sanskaran ke antargat mangalvaar ko rajeev gandhi antarrashtriya stadium main kolkata nite rides ke saath khele jane vaale lig mukaable ko jitkar ek baar phir se jeet kii patari par lautnaa chaahegi vahiin nite rides kii koshish lagaataar teesri jeet darj karne par hogi
 In the IPL-4, the two teams have clashed once so far, in which the hands of the Knight Riders have won
 nite rides ne apane gharelu maidan par deccan ko nau wicket se haraa chukaa he
 In this sense, Deccan now have a golden opportunity to defeat the Knight Riders on their home ground
 nite rides ne is pratiyogita main ab tak aath mukaable khele hai jisamen paanch maichon main use jeet mili he jabaki teen muqablon main use haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 With 10 points, the Knight Riders team is in second place in the points table, while Deccan have also played eight matches but have won three matches and have lost five matches
 chah ankon ke saath deccan kii team ank talika main chathe sthaan par he
 In the previous match, after the defeat of Kings XI Punjab by eight wickets, the Knight Riders are strong
 captain gautam gambheer or manoj tiwari behtareen form main hai jabaki jacks kallis, eon morgan or yusuf pathan ke rup main nite rides ke paas teen harfanmaulaa khilaadi hai jo kabhi bhi apni gendbaaji or ballebaaji ke dam par match kaa rukh apni ore modane main sakasham hai
 The fast bowling will be on the shoulders of experienced Brett Lee and Laxmipathy Balaji, while Iqbal Abdullah will be responsible for the spin
 duusari ore, chennai ke khilaaf ravivaar 19 ranon se haar jhelane ke baad deccan kii koshish is mukaable ko jeetne kii hogi
 Deccan's biggest weakness is the inability of its batsmen and bowlers to walk together
 sani sohal, bharat chipli or captain kumaar sangakaara ke kandhon par par deccan kii ballebaaji kaa daaromadar rahegaa vahiin shikhar dhawan, camran white, jyaan paul dumini or danniel christian ko bhi ballebaaji main apni takat dikhaani hogi
 The manner in which fast bowler Ishant Sharma bowled poorly in the last match against Chennai has shown that he needs to improve his bowling while Deccan have two world class spin bowlers in the form of Amit Mishra and Pragyan Ojha

 But the first day of Bigg Boss house, the audience found the entertainment less boring
 pehla episod oner hone ke baad se sho ko trol kiya ja rahaa he
 The reason for this is the content of the show, which makes Bigg Boss season 13 away from the category of family shows
 darasal, somvaar ke episod main gharavaalon ko rashan baanta gaya
 Amisha Patel, the mistress of Bigg Boss house, came to give ration to the family
 lekin ye itnaa aasaan nahin tha
 The householders had to do a sloppy task for rationing
 jahaan sabhi contestants ko apane BFF ke saath line se baithna tha or rashan ko munh se ek-duusare ko paas karnaa tha
 All was right until the first rations passed large items
 baad main andey, pyaaj, tamaato jaise chote item contestants ko munh se paas karne the
 Such sinister tasks in viewers like Splitsvilla and Roadies digest the audience

 These include Amar Saxena (ritesh Deshmukh), Meet Mehta (vivek Oberoi) and Prem Chawla (aftab Shivdasani)

 aakhirkaar kya hota he, ye aapako film dekhakar hi pataa chalegaa
 Script: The story of the film is very weak, where the first half is quite loose, the latter part of the interval is shaken even more, although the dialogues of Sanjay Mishra and Ritesh make you laugh at some places but according to the name the film has many shortcomings
 
 abhinay:ritesh deshmukh kaa abhinay kaaphi acha lagata he vahiin sanjay mishra or ritesh kii saasu maa kaa kirdaar nibhaati huin ushaa nadakrini ji ne kaaphi acha kaam kiya he
 Vivek Oberoi, Aftab Shivdasani, Urvashi Rautela, Pooja Bose, Mishti, Shraddha Das and others have also acted well
 haalanki casting or bhi behatar ho sakati thi
 The film also has cameos by Shradesh Talpade as well as Sudesh Lahiri and Sonali Raut
 kamjor kadi:film kii kamjor kadi isaki script or kamjor casting he, jise or bhi behatar kiya ja saktaa tha
 Music: The music of the film is fine but more songs are heard than the story, which if reduced, would make the film even more crisp
 kyon dekhen:kabhi tivi par aegi to dekh lijiega, is weekend paise ko bachaana hi behatar he

 kya un channelon par bhi girish karnad ko shradhanjali di ja rahi hogi jinke urban naksal ke propeganda ke virodh main girish karnad beemaari ke baad bhi urban naksal kii takhti lekar khadey ho gaye the? jin logon ko urban naksal bataakar jail bheja gaya tha, wo aaj bhi jail main hai
 Sudha Bhardwaj is still in jail
 gauri lankesh kii hatya kii jaanch ek mukaam par pahunchi to he magar anjaam se ab bhi dur he
 When a political deal is reached and the files of the investigation are changed, nothing can be said
 google main girish karnad tip karenge to ‘main bhi urban naksal' kii takhti liye unki tasviir chaaron taraf se aa jaaegi
 It would seem that this is the only legacy of Girish Karnad's life
 sitambar 2018 kii ghatana thi
 Girish Karnad came out with this plank on the occasion of the first anniversary of Gauri Lankesh's murder
 bataane ke liye asahmati ke swaron ko tivi channelon or twitor par trend karakar nahin dabaaya ja saktaa he
 They cannot be intimidated by being called anti national and urban naxalites
 girish karnad biimaar the
 There was a tube in his nose but came to protest
 anti neshnal, urban naksal, anti modi, tukade tukade gang, khan market gang
 They were traded in public every day and it was assured that the remaining group of people who question the government are Urban Naxals
 desh or pradhanmantri ke liye khatara he
 Then the same terminology was passed through whatsapp to those ordinary houses who did not even know what is Naxal and what is Urban Naxal
 gauri lankesh kii hatya hui to unhen bhi urban naksal kaha jane laga
 There was a debate day and night on the news channels regarding the Urban Naxalite
 chaar-paanch chehre dikhaae gaye, unke aage urban naksal likhaa gaya
 On saying Rahul Gandhi's watchman is a thief, the Prime Minister's watchman campaign is also called master stroke
 girish karnad kaa main bhi urban naksal kahana, deshadroh ho jaataa he
 That is why a case is filed against them in the police station
 ''bhayaavah yah nahin ki naksal yaa aatankwaadi kya kar rahe hai, jo police kah rahi he wo bhayaavah he
 Unbridled allegations are being made against rationalists
 yah taarkik tarika nahin he
 It's scary because they think they can do whatever they want
 pune main koi cese kii jaanch kar rahaa he or dilli main baithkar unhen koi nirdesh de rahaa he
 This is sad
 agar bolne kaa matlab naksal hona he to main urban naksal hum
 i am proud that my name is on this list
 ''girish karnad ne media se yahi kaha tha
 Urban Naxal is the same chapter of the national syllabus of national media after 2014 that starts only on the first page and ends on that
 ek panne ke is silebus main jab urban naksal kehane se man bhar jaataa he to kisi ko anti neshnal kaha jane lagata he, jab anti neshnal kehane se man bhar jaataa he to thode samay ke liye hindi main deshadrohi kaha jane lagata he, jab deshadrohi se man bhar jaataa he to anti hindu kaha jane lagata he, jab anti hindu se man bhar jaataa he to use anti modi kaha jane lagata he
 And when the Urban Naxal moved out of the book of political propaganda and sat in the mind of the people, then the word comes on the Prime Minister's tongue
 november 2018
 Chhattisgarh Assembly Election
 jagadalpur main bhaashan dete hue pradhanmantri modi kehete hai ki ''jo urban maovadi hai wo shahro main asi gharon main rahete hai, saaf suthere dikhte hai, achche khaase logon main baithne uthne kaa rutaba banaate hai, unke bachche videshon main padhate hai, acchhee acchhee gadiyon main ghoomte hai, lekin vahaan baithe baithe remote system se adivasee bacchon kii jindagi tabah karne kaa kaam karte hai
 Also note that Prime Minister Modi has paid tribute to the death of an urban Naxal
 unke yogadanon ko yaad kiya he
 Girish Karnad came to India studying abroad and composed while living here
 asi kamare main bhi baithkar rachaa or non asi kamare main bhi
 How easily governments have handed over their failures to a new, unknown fabric
 aaj bastar main pachaas hazaar adivasee apni zamin bachaane ke liye sangharsh kar rahe hai
 According to the media reports, fifty thousand tribals have come out of their homes to protest against the sale of 13 mines of Bailadila to Adani
 kya koi ankar in adivaasiyon ke liye apane channel par chilla rahaa he? adani kaa maamla he isliye koi congress sarkaar se bhi nahin poochhega
 BJP also will not agitate for the rights of tribals
 paanchavi anusoochi ke kshetra main pehle bhi adivaasiyon ke haq or zamin luute gaye
 Even before, his voice was not represented
 ab to or bhi nahin hoga
 Our writing on the legacy of Girish Karnad will be too short
 unki viraasat us bharat kii saanskrithik viraasat he jise hameshaa apni vividhta par garv rahaa he
 Somebody wanted to kill Girish Karnad who watered this variety
 kisi ne unki hatya kii baat sochi
 How they are being paid tribute to that society and media, i do not know
 main news channel nahin dekhtaa
 i believe that news channels are killing the diversity of India's democracy
 aap channel dekhte samay note kiijie ki aaj wo girish karnad ke bare main kya kya baaten kar rahe hai, kis film ke footage dikhaa rahe hai
 What interviews do they have, what visuals do they have to tell you about this great man
 in sawaalon se dekhie, aapako yakeen ho jayega ki channelon kii na to aapmen dilchaspee he or na hi girish karnad main thi
 Despite this, many people are remembering Girish Karnad
 unhone kisi news channel or uske lophar ankaron ke zarie girish karnad ko nahin janaa tha
 He continued to read his plays for several decades, watching the plays, staging them, watching his films
 tab jaakar unhone janaa ki girish karnad ke hone kaa kya matlab he
 Those who remember him are the biggest reason for trust at this time
 ab bhi channelon ke kaaran sabakuch nahin mitaa he
 Girish Karnad's memories are different even after the intrigues of Urban Naxal Propaganda
 jahaan unki moulikta, pratibha or rachanaatmakataa raaj karti he
 Before the departure of a great man, recall the controversies that took place on his last day and the background of those controversies

 Before the film on Yakub Memon, the board was adamant about passing Anurag Kashyap's film 'udta Punjab' with 22 cuts, but Kashyap approached the Supreme Court and passed the film with just one cut
 The order was heard

 The Government of India is unaware that around 40,000 Rohingyas are living in camps in different parts here
 bihar kii siyasat main nai ibaarat likhane ke liye 30 oktober 2003 ko nitish kumaar ko sharad yadav ke rup main jo siyaasi sarathi mila tha
 Today, time and circumstances have brought him to such a political point that the same charioteer was separated from him
 jabaki in 13 saalon main nitish ke liye sharad hameshaa dhaal kii tarah rahe, chaahe lalu satta kaa singhaasana chhinane kii baat rahi ho yaa phir modi ke naam par endie se alag raah chalane kii
 How JD was formed: Sharad Yadav, Nitish Kumar and Ram Vilas Paswan came together to oust Lalu Prasad Yadav from the power of Chief Minister Bihar
 nitish kumaar kii samta party, jiske adhyaksh george fernadies the or paswan kii lokshakti party ne sharad yadav kii janata dal ke saath mili or phir bana janata janata dal (united)
 In this, the election mark of Samata Party arrow was taken and ZU was named after the party and flag Sharad Yadav's Janata Dal
 jabaki kuch din ke baad paswan alag hokar apni party algepi alag bana lee, lekin sharad yadav nitish kaa saath nahin choda
 Nitish had found Sharad for Sahara to hold the throne of Bihar's power, Nitish Kumar resorted to the strong shoulders of Sharad Yadav
 iske baad bijepi se bhi haath milaayaa or 24 oktober 2005 main lalu prasad yadav ke siyaasi tilism ko todakar soobe kii satta kii chaabi apane haath main lee
 Sharad remained Sharad Yadav, at every step of Sharad stood with him, supported him by becoming his political charioteer
 nitish kumaar bihar kii siyasat sambhalate rahe to sharad dilli ke siyaasi galiyaaron or media ke jariye unki chhavi main chaar chand lagane kaa kaam karte
 Not only this, through Sharad, Nitish Kumar has managed to combine Muslim votes and Yadav votes
 jabaki pehle ye donon samudaay ke vot bank ke saath hua karte the
 Despite ZU being with the BJP, a large section of Muslims and Yadavs joined them
 jisase lalu kii argedy soobe main aakhri saanse lene lagi thi
 In September 2013, the politics of Bihar took a new turn in the name of Modi
 ye vahi samay tha jab bijepi ne pradhanmantri pad ke liye narendra modi ke naam kaa elaan kiya to nitish kumaar ne apana naata hi tod liya
 Nitish Kumar has been with NDA for the last 13 years
 atal sarkaar main ve mantri the
 In such a difficult time, Sharad Yadav was forced to step forward
 sharad dilli main siyaasi bisaat bichhaakar nitish kumaar kii dhaal bane
 Sharad Yadav made it clear that our party line is secular
 If Modi comes, we cannot follow this line of BJP
 jabaki sharad or modi ke bich kisi tarah raajnneetik varchasv kii baat nahin thi
 At the same time, there was definitely a war of political supremacy between Nitish and Modi
 baavjood iske sharad ne nitish ke bachaav main khadey hue
 He kept supporting as a true charioteer
 ab modi ke kaaran hi tuuti dostiloksabhaa 2014 chunaav main bihar main endie ne 40 main se 33 siten jiti thi
 Nitish's party was reduced to just two seats
 aise main nitish ke saamne apane vajood ko bachaae rakhane kaa sankat khadaa hua to sharad yadav phir unke sarathi bane
 Sharad then formed a grand alliance in Bihar through Lalu Prasad Yadav
 2015 ke soobe ke chunaav main bijepi ko shikast dekar nitish satta barkaraar rakhi
 But in July 2017, there was a rift between Lalu and Nitish, then he left Lalu and joined hands with the BJP, alleging a corruption case
 centre kii endie kaa hissaa bhi banane ja rahe hai
 Sharad was unaware of this news
 isi vajah se sharad ne nitish ke khilaaf baghawat kaa jhanda uthaa liya
 In such a situation, Nitish's 13-year-old charioteer parted
 yani nitish 13 saal kii dosti jahaan bijepi se todi thi to vahiin 13 saal puraane saathi ko bhi ab chhod diya he

 Disputed statement of UP Governor Ram Naik has emerged amid the conversion controversy
 ram nik ne kaha he ki ayodhya main ram mandir jald bananaa chahie
 On the conversion issue of Agra, the governor said that the state government will have to investigate it

 This is the wish of the people and this wish must be fulfilled

 aaj phir garma sakati he sansaddharmantaran ke masale par sansad aaj phir garma sakati he
 Yesterday, the Opposition walked out after a debate in the Lok Sabha
 sansadeey kaarymantri venkaiya naidu ke jawaab se vipaksh naaraaz tha
 Venkaiah praised RSS and described RSS as a great organization
 unhone sangh se jude hone par gaurav jaahir bhi kiya
 Jyotiraditya Scindia took the front on behalf of the Congress
 unhone pradhanmantri se puure maamle par safai maangi
 At the same time, SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav expressed surprise over the uproar over the conversion
 unhone kaha ki jab agra main hangaamaa nahin to yahaan (sansad) main kyon ho rahaa he? It was not even 48 hours after the Bharatiya Janata Party-led front's landslide victory in the Assam assembly elections on May 19 that party president Amit Shah was holding a meeting at his office at party headquarters 11, Ashok Road
 jeet se unka mood behad utsahit tha, yah kahana unke bhav ko kam karke aankna hoga kyonki assam kii taaja jeet pichley november main bihar main khaae jakhmon par bijepi ke liye darasal ek maraham thi
 In his first address as party president on August 9, 2014, Shah promised to put Assam in the BJP fold
 yah jeet shah ke liye badi raahat lekar ai thi
 Despite this, Shah and his colleagues did not discuss Assam in this meeting, but rather they were looking beyond the horizon — they were working to devise strategy for next year's Uttar Pradesh and Punjab assembly elections and in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections Narendra was talking on ensuring a second term for Modi
 assam fatah kii khuraaq itani utsahvarddhak he ki in ranneetiyon ko lekar kisi ko koi shaq nahin hona chahie
 After the defeat of Bihar, Amit Shah had softened slightly
 un tak pahunchnaa bhi aasaan ho gaya tha
 His second innings as BJP President was seen hanging in the balance
 unki aakraamakata ab laut ai he
 Shah, who created a "congress-free India" in 2014, once again on May 19 on the day of counting, made a statement in the media, "this country is just two steps from the dream of Congress-free India"
 is far
 ’’ isamen koi shaq nahin ki congress kii khaali ho rahi jagah ko koun-si party bharegi
 He told India Today, "the BJP has now become an All India Party
 aaj ham kuccha se kamrup or kashmir se kanyakumari tak maujuud hai
 "the whispers over the imminent change in party and government after the new machine election of the electoral battle have now come to the fore
" assam ke janadesh ke fouran baad pradhanmantri narendra modi, kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali or shah ke bich mana ja rahaa he ki ek ahm baithak hui he jisamen endie ke do saal pehle satta main aane ke baad pehali baar gaharaai se pherbadal kaa ek khaakaa bana he
 a team of independent researchers working for Shah has evaluated the working of cabinet ministers
 nattejey na dikhaane vaale mantriyon ko shaayad rajyapal banaakar bhej diya jayega, rajyamantriyon ke bhi badalane kii gunjaaish he or sambhav he ki pradesh ikaayiyon ko nae prabharee die jaaen
 This blueprint will be finalized in the coming weeks when Shah will form the new team
 is punargathan se chunavi jang ke liye bijepi or sarkaar kaa ek nayaa aakaar ubharkar saamne aayega jo bahut sambhav he ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon tak aparivartit hi rahe
 On 12 and 13 June, the party's executive meeting is going to be held in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh for the first time in five years
 is kaaryakarini main agle saal uttar pradesh or punjab ke chunaavon kii ranneeti ko antim rup diya jayega
 On May 26, the party will launch a month-long campaign
 yah endie ke do saal puure hone kaa jashn utana nahin hoga jitna ki uske chunaav prachaar abhiyaan kaa aagaaj hoga
 Party workers will communicate with various sections of the society at 200 places across the country
 in sthanon kaa chunaav adhiktam siyaasi asar ke hisaab se kiya gaya he
 The activists have been asked to inform the public about the schemes of the government, including youth, women and economically weaker sections
 party kaaryakartaaon kii teen sadasyeey ek team sabhi 200 sthanon par kaaryakartaaon kii pahunch par nigaraanee rakhegi
 The driving force behind this new strategy will remain the old pair of modi-shah, even though there is a slight difference of opinion between the two
 masalan, shah kattar hindutv ke samarthak hai jabaki modi is maamle main thodaa maheen ravaiya apanaate hai
 Shah is a strategist within the party who relies on information from the general secretaries
 modi mukhyamantri badalane jaise samvedansheel masalon par hi apni antim raay rakhte hai
 For example, the recipe for reaching 200 places was given by Shah to Modi, who stamped it
 shah kii dincharya ab bhi kaaphi vyast he—ve janvari tak rojaanaa 465 kilometre kii ausat yatra kar chuke the or bharat ke sabhi 31 rajyon main ja chuke the
 Bihar's lesson Last November's loss to Bihar was a warning to the BJP
 dilli main use jitani maar jhelni padi thi, usase kahin zyada bihar ne party kii kamajoriyon ko sataha par laane kaa kaam kiya jab party kaa saamana ekajute vipaksh ke saath hua
 The defeat also raised apprehension on the party's star campaigner Narendra Modi, who addressed around 40 public meetings in the state last October
 apni haar se sabak lete hue party ne ek ranneeti banaai jise usne ‘‘assam model’’ kaa naam diya
 Here the party did not campaign vigorously on the lines of Delhi and Bihar and tried to avoid personal attacks
 isi yojana ko ab anya rajyon main lagu karne kaa prastaav he jahaan saavdhaneepurvak chunavi jang main utarate hue pehle hi pani naap liya jayega
 In Assam, for example, the BJP did not raise the issue of illegal infiltrators beyond a threshold
 haal ke chunaavon main pehali baar usne ek sthaneey chehre ko saamne rakhaa or sarbanand sonoval ko pehle hi mukhyamantri pad kaa pratyaashee ghoshit kar daalaa
 The nitish-lalu pair tossed out the Bihar vs Bahoor, also gave a lesson to the BJP
 vah yah ki chunavi rajya main baahar se star prachaarkon ko laana nuksandeh sabit ho saktaa he
 This creates a wrong kind of confusion and enthusiasm among the grassroots activists, who start believing that one public meeting is enough to win the election
 is baar modi or shah ne prachaar ke dauraan assam kii sirf teen yatraaen kin, rajnath do baar vahaan gaye or arun jetali tathaa sushamaa swaraj ne sirf ek yatra kii
 The grassroots activists were freed for extensive programs of contact with the public
 party ne yah bhi tay kiya he ki vah modi ko jarurat se zyada saamne nahin laaegi
 This will save them for the big battle of 2019
 party ko duusare dalon se netaa apane yahaan laane main koi sankoch nahin he, jaisaa ki usne assam congress se hemanth biswa sarama ko laakar dikhaaya
 a top party leader says, "winning elections is more a matter of practicality than ideology
" ’’isi vyaavhaarikta kaa ek durlabh mujahiraa tab hua jab party netritv ne aresas kii assam ikai ke hastkshep ko darkinar kar diya
 It is a different matter that the party will use the RSS in elections to further the success of 2014
 shah philhal aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat or modi ke bich achche rishton ko bhunaa rahe hai jiske chalate sangh or sarkaar ke bich matbhed sataha par aane se rah ja rahe hai
 The BJP has formulated a five-point strategy for all the upcoming elections — economic empowerment through schemes like corruption-free administration, Jan Dhan, economic growth through schemes like Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Stand-up India and Start-up India, less Financial security through two installment life insurance and accident insurance schemes and finally, MNREGA national asset creation Combined with sustainable economic growth
 2019 ke liye 100 siton kii yojanashaah kaa maananaa he ki vindhyas ke uttari rajyon main bijepi kii tarakkee kii gunjaaish samaapt ho chuki he jahaan usne loksabhaa kii 282 main se 220 siten jiti thim
 Of these, 71 seats out of 80 in Uttar Pradesh, 26 seats in Gujarat, 25 seats in Rajasthan and 27 out of 29 seats in Madhya Pradesh came to BJP
 sirf inhen rajyon par 2019 kii jeet ke liye bharosa kaayam rakhana kuch zyada ashaavadi najariya hoga
 That's why Amit Shah has devised a recipe: It is a 100-seat plan
 unke nishane par ab ek nayaa kshetra haih assam kii brahmaputra ghati se lekar kerala ke malabar tat tak kii pattee jisamen pashchim bengal, kerala, tamilnadu, odisha, telugana or andhra pradesh aate hai
 All these together constitute a total of 205 seats in the Lok Sabha, but the bjp's base in these states is weak
 yahaan use sirf 9 siten haath lagi thim—assam main saat or 2014 main pashchim bengal main do
 Shah believes that if the party works unitedly, then in these states, it can have a gold mine
 inhen rajyon main party agle do saal main chunaav kendrit kaaryakramon or ek shashakt netritv kaa sammishran istemaal karke apane aadhaar ko vyapak banaaegi
 The party's general secretary in Assam, Ram Madhav, is excited about the party's prospects
 haalia vidhansabha chunaavon main ve bade hue vot pratishat kii ore ishaara karte hai
 He says, "if we go from 11 per cent to 43 per cent of 2011 elections in states and 4 together with coalition partners in West Bengal
 1 fisadi se 15 fisadi tak vot pratishat badha sake hai, to hamaare paas aatmavishvaas kii har vajah maujuud he
 "up's challenge Next year, Shah is very cautious about the elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab and is working on a two-pronged policy of attack and defense
" punjab main unhen kisi aise tareeke kii talash he jisase dashak bhar main bane satta virdohi maahaul ko ve apane paale main kar saken
 Apart from this, in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, there is a possibility that the BJP will suffer some loss in the 2018 elections as it has been ruling here for 13 years
 uttar pradesh haalanki is maamle main bhinn he ki party yahaan 2002 ke baad se hi satta se baahar he or yaheen unki chunavi ranneeti kaa sabase tagada imtihaan hona he
 In the Lok Sabha elections, Shah had taken 71 out of 80 seats with the help of Modi's wave and deliberate ticket distribution
 upi main agar ve haarate hai, to 2019 main jeet ke sapane par sawalia nishaan lag jayega
 That is why they seem ready to do anything here
 party kaa mishan upi 1 may ko shuru hua tha jab modi ne apni sarkaar kii mahatvakankshi pradhanmantri ujjwala yojana kaa shubharambh yahaan se kiya tha
 It is Rs 800 crore
 kii laagat vaali yojana he jisamen garibi rekha se neeche jeevanyaapan kar rahe paanch karod pariwaron ko alpiji ke conection die jaaenge
 Relying on the strength of backward caste leaders, the party has appointed Keshav Prasad Maurya as state president here
 pradesh ikai ko pichhadi jati aadhaarit sanghathan ke rup main shakl de di gai he
 Of the 90 newly appointed district presidents in the state, 44 are leaders from backward castes and four are Dalits
 pichhadaa card khelte vakt haalanki shah or maathur ko yah dhyaan main rakhana hoga ki ve brahmanon ko na bhul jaaen jin par mayawati dobaaraa dore daal rahi hai
 There is also a plan to raise the clean governance and good governance of the Modi government against the alleged misconduct of Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party
 yuvaaon or mahilaon ko lakshith karne kii yojana ke antargat bijepi kii pradesh ikai ne rajya ke kul 1

 Manipulation of marginal votes in up's all-round war can also prove to be effective

 BJP is considering Mayawati as its biggest challenge, so it is trying to turn BSP leaders towards itself

 jiske baad pisibi ne afridi ko notice bheja
 Afridi, while speaking to the media at the airport, said that Pakistan did not take an aggressive stand against the West Indies, which led to the team dropping out of the tournament before the semi-finals
 afridi ne yah bhi kaha tha ki agar unhen captaini kii peshkash kii gai to vah desh or team ke liye is chunauti ko sanbhaalane ke liye taiyaar hai
 According to sources, Afridi has been asked to explain why he spoke to the media

 The JNU Students' Union election process is completely different from Delhi University

 Ishita said that after considering this student's application, we have decided that if any opinion poll occurs before the code of conduct is implemented and the names of the candidates are announced, it is appropriate and its effect does not affect the voters in the election

 Secularism has very strong roots in India
 agar narendra modi pradhanmantri ban bhi jate hai to ve ise nahin badal sakenge

 If Madni ji has such information then no political party should do so
 sabase pehle mujhe nahin lagata ki modi kabhi is desh ke piem ban sakate hai
 i think this is impossible and most Muslims of the country think so too
 kisi bhi dharmanirpeksh party ko modi kii chhavi kaa phayda nahin uthaanaa chahie or na hi iskaa istemaal musalamaanon ko daraane ke liye hona chahie
 The Muslim community is completely free to think about its vote

 upi main sattarudh samaajawaadee party main philhal sangram thama hua bhale hi dikh rahaa ho lekin taaja poster war ne phir ise saamne laa diya he
 On the one hand, preparations are being made for the grand event in Janeshwar Mishra Park on the completion of 25 years of Samajwadi Party, the master of which is Dhar Shivpal Yadav
 to duusari taraf mukhyamantri awaas ke thik saamne laa martenior skool ke ground main akhilesh yadav kii team ji jaan se rath yatra ko bhavy or shandaar aayojan banane ke liye juty hui he
 On the 3rd, Akhilesh Yadav will start his Rath Yatra from here and will travel up to Unnao on the first day and return to Lucknow
 lekin rathyatra or rajat jayanti se pehle lakhanu main poster waar shuru ho gaya he
 Most of the roads in Lucknow are covered with posters and banners of Akhilesh Yadav
 mukhyamantri awaas or uske aasapaas ke ilaake main to har inch par hording lag chuki he
 There is a competition among the leaders to increase their numbers by getting more and more banner posters printed
 agar shivpal or akhilesh ke ghamaasan ke bich main poster or hording ko hathiyaar maane to yah kaha ja saktaa he ki philhal akhilesh yadav kaaphi aage najar aate hai
 Compared to Akhilesh Yadav's hoardings, there are only a few poster banners of Shivpal Yadav
 zyaadaatar logon ne akhilesh ke saath sirf mulaayam singh kii photo lagaai he
 Most hoardings and poster banners have been installed by the supporters of the leaders, including their names and photographs themselves
 akhilesh yadav ke binar poster lagane vaale zyaadaatar logon ne shivpal yadav se kinaaraa kar liya he- baavjood iske ki vah party ke pradesh adhyaksh hai
 There are few ministers like Gayatri Prajapati who have tried to get both sides in the midst of this boast and have installed hoardings for both
 khaas baat yah he ki shivpal yadav ne jin tamaam yuva netaaon ko party virdohi gatividhiyon ke aarope main samaajawaadee party se baahar nikaal diya tha un logon ne bhi akhilesh yadav ke samarthan main binar poster lagaae hai
 It is also worth noting that the hoardings that have been put on by all the people, describing Akhilesh Yadav's Rath Yatra as a journey from development to victory, have not been done by the Samajwadi Party but by the Janeshwar Mishra Trust
 akhilesh yadav kii team aajkal janeshwar mishra trust main hi baithkar vahiin se kaamkaaj kar rahi he
 On the 3rd, Akhilesh Yadav will start his rath yatra from La Martiniere Ground in front of the Chief Minister's residence, which will be flagged by Mulayam Singh Yadav
 abhi tak kii khabaron ke hisaab se vahaan par shivpal yadav bhi maujuud rahenge taaki yah sandesh diya ja sake ki matbhed ke baavjood samaajawaadee party ek he
 Similarly, Akhilesh Yadav will stop the Rath Yatra in the middle and will participate in the party's Silver Jubilee celebrations on 5th

 It seems that the countries of the world are not able to solve complex issues like climate change and equality
 kritrim buddhivaala raajnneetijna fasebuk massenger ke jariye logon ko pratikriya dena lagaataar sikh rahaa he
 Gerritsen believes that human biases in algorithms can have an impact, but in his view biases are not a challenge in technology-related solutions

 Both these accused had fired at the hospital to recover the ransom
 gurugram estf kii team pichley kai dinon se aropiyon kii talash kar rahi thi
 Police received information that two accused are present in the village
 uske baad ek team maukey par pahunchi or kaaphi jaddojahad ke baad kaushal gang ke do sadasyon ko kaabo kar liya
 Both the accused named Saurav and Gaurav are real brothers

 Gangster Kaushal used to call people and ask for ransom and after that both these brothers used to go there and bring ransom money
 estf ke pakade gaye donon aropiyon kii pahchaan gurugram ke gaanv gadauli khurd nivasee saurabh or gaurav ke rup main kii gai he

 namvar singh aspataal main hai
 At the age of 92, he suffered a head injury
 agar prarthana jaisi koi chiz hoti he to hindi ke sansar ko unke liye prarthana kerani chahie
 It is a misfortune of our generation that we saw him in his later years - at an age when the sun of his glory was on the slope
 meri pehali mulaakaat unase tab hui, jab ve sattar paar kar chuke the
 Of course, he had the opportunity to listen to some of his speeches earlier
 bas yah kalpana kii ja sakati he ki apane banate hue dinon main unka taap kaisaa rahaa hoga, unki tikshnata kitni gahari rahi hogi
 i did not live among the fortunate students who got the opportunity to study with them
 na hindi meraa vishay tha na jeenyu yaa dilli main maine padhai kii
 Therefore, i did not live in his powerful Bhima Arjuna
 ye bhim-arjuna desh bhar main faile hue hai or apane dron ke prati kritagyata ke boj se dabe hue hai
 But in the Hindi world, more than these bhima-arjunas, there were a large number of singles who gained their knowledge by meditating on the idol of Namvar
 main bhi aisa hi eklavya tha jo ranchi main baith kar namvar singh kii sakriyata ko kareeb se dekhtaa-padhata tha or hindi kii duniya ke bare main ek raay banaaya karata tha
 This is the real value of being famous
 unhone hindi ke kheton ko sinchaa he
 He traveled in remote areas, meeting people and writers, explaining the value of composition and criticism
 locarpan-vimochan karte rahe, seminar-sangoshtiyon ke lagbhag sthaayee mukhya atithi or adhyaksh banate rahe
 Of course, many people have been obliged and many others have also criticized, but Namvar ji, despite being Kabir's city, probably does not believe in Chadariya's status quo
 ve duniya kii dhul-mitti main bane or sane aalochak hai
 There is no such thing as solitude in his life style or thought style, he is a consistently communicative critic who earned fame by speaking more than writing
 yah pehle bhi maine ekaadhik baar likhaa he ki dow
 Ramvilas Sharma was like a mountain - stable, unwavering, unmoved, away from the cacophony of contemporaryism
 ve kitabon kaa pahaad khadaa karte rahe
 But reaching them, going to them was not an easy task
 yah kalpana or bhi dushwaar thi ki ve aapke paas aaenge
 But the river named Namvar comes to you - flowing in the plains of Hindi, making the soil of Hindi fertile and incorporating a lot of garbage inside it
 dilli aakar yah nadi bahut saare logon ko yamuna jaisi lagane lagi thi to usamen nadi kaa kam, us paryaavaran kaa dosha zyada tha jo apana kachra behichak nadi main undelata rahaa
 Of course, this river did not raise its cool banks so high that the soil outside could not get inside
 namvar singh vidwaan hai, lekin vidwata ke aatank ko pare rakhte aae hai
 Their intellectual activism keeps them constantly contemporary and they keenly read young people
 hindi ke bahut saare yuva lekhakon kaa anubhav yah hoga ki unke lekh pard kar, unki kavita pard kar, namvar singh ne unhen phone kiya
 My personal experience is also there
 jab 1996 main maine jansatta main kuch tippaniyan likhin to unhone mere bare main poochtacha shuru kii
 When they first met, they knew everything
 us pehali mulaakaat ke baad ve jab mili, hameshaa usee utfullata se mili, hameshaa kisi likhe hue kii charchaa karte rahe, kuch nayaa likhane ke liye prerit karte rahe
 Namwar Singh was one of the scholars who got Hindi out of its dhoti-kurta, Janeu
 hindi waalon ko marxvad sikhaaya, marxvaadi aalochana sikhaai
 They made a lot of attacks and suffered heavy attacks
 yah hamaare samay kii hi baat he jab ek hi goshtee main ve rajendra yadav par or rajendra yadav un par taana kasne main koi kasar nahin chhodte
 Whatever the literary competition behind it, but friendly Chuhal overshadowed it
 lekin hamane namvar singh par aise hamale bhi dekhe jinke peeche unako pratishthaut karne kii manshaa dikhti rahi
 Those who criticized him very 'prejudicially' at the time of publication of 'criticism' could not extract the same points of 'criticism' when the opportunity arose later
 baharhaal, philhal namvar singh ke swasth hone kii kaamana karen
 His presence in Hindi's constantly obscure world still serves as a lighthouse
 haal ke dinon main kai baar smriti unka saath chhodti dikhi he, unka samvedan tantra kamazor padataa dikhaa he, lekin unke vivek kii chamak ab bhi apni kaundh se prabhavit karti he
 They are like a river of sweet water in the society of Hindi - they have watered us, they have some water inside us

 On its decision to change the names of six areas of Arunachal Pradesh, China has said that it is its 'legal right' to do so
 china kaa daawa he ki vah naam badal saktaa he kyonki is rajya kaa ek hissaa 'dakshini tibet' he
 However, India has been denying this claim of the neighboring country for years
 gauratlab he ki is maheene dalai lamas ke arunachal pradesh daure par aapatti jataate hue china ke nagirak maamalon ke mantralay ne is kshetra ke chah ilaakon ke chini naam rakhane kaa elaan kiya
 On this, Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday reiterated clearly that Arunachal is an integral part of India and China does not have the right to change the name of Indian areas
 unhone poocha ki kya koi padosi aapkaa naam badalane kaa adhikaar rakhata he
 The comments isse pehle china ne bharat ko chetaya tha ki arunachal main dalai lamas kaa aana donon deshon ke bich rishton ko nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 China has called the 81-year-old Tibetan leader a dangerous separatist who wants to drive Tibet away from China
 vahiin bharat doharaata aayaa he ki dalai lamas ke is daure kaa makasad dharmik ekta ke maddenzar tha or iskaa koi raajnneetik matlab na nikaala jaae
 India also stressed that China has no right to interfere in India's internal affairs

 Due to the harsh cold, the demand for electricity in Uttar Pradesh has increased
 udhar pradesh sarkaar ne logon ko aashwast kiya he ki vidyut aapurti main kami nahin hone di jaaegi
 The demand for electricity has increased from 10,500 to 11,000 MW due to increasing winter and average demand is around 9,000 to 9,500 MW while the total availability of power from all sources including the state's thermal and hydro power stations is around 8,500 MW
 bijli vibhaag ke adhikariyon ke mutabik sheetalhar chalane par log blower, gijar or heater jaise bijli se chalane vaale upkarnon kaa prayog shuru kar dete hai
 Due to this, the demand for electricity increases
 uttar pradesh power korporation nigam limited (upipisiel) ke adhyaksh navaneet sahagal ne kaha ki pradesh sarkaar upabhoktaaon ko zyada se zyada bijli uplabdh karaane ke liye harasambhav prayaas kar rahi he
 There is no such situation as power shortage
 unhone kaha ki saal ke ant tak kareeb 500 megawatt bijli kaa atirikt utpaadan shuru ho jayega, jisase bijli kii uplabdhta main or ijapha ho jayega
 Demanding that black money will be curbed, questions are being raised on the exercise that has been going on for the last 48 days
 desh main kaledhan kaa ambara he to iskaa shrot sarkari mahakama, sarkaar karmchaaree or desh ke chote-bade kaarobaari hai
 The link connecting all this is the country's politicians and their political parties
 lihaaja kaledhan par lagaam lagane ke liye he jaruri he ki pehle raajnneetik dalon kii kamai ko nazarandaaj karne vaale kanoonee praavdhaanon ko rokna hoga
 The ED, meanwhile, has started an investigation into the deposition of Rs 104 crore in an account of the Bahujan Samaj Party and the benami property of Mayawati's brother
 - desh main notebandi ke jariekaledhan par lagaamalgane kii kavayad ke bich chunaav ayog ne sarkaar se maang kii he ki raajnneetik dalon ko chande main milane vaali rakam par se pardaa uthaane kii jarurat he
 All attempts to eliminate black money from the country without this exercise will fail
 - desh kaa kanoon raajnneetik dalon kii ho rahi kamai par inakam tex se puri tarah se chhot detaa he
 This exemption given to political parties is behind section 13A of the Income Tax Act 1961
 is kanoon ke mutabik raajnneetik dalon ko makaan or sampatti, dhan-laabh athwa ghoshit or gumnaam chande se hui kamai par tex nahin lagaaya jayega
 - Section 29C of the Representation of People Act 1951, a law made for political parties, only imposes partial restrictions on the amount of donations received by political parties
 yah kanoon kahata he ki kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ko 20,000 rupee se adhik praapt gumnaam chande kaa vivaran chunaav ayog ko dena hoga
 The donations received less than this amount will remain only other income for political parties
 - ab chunaav ayog ne raajnneetik dalon dwaara kaledhan ke istemaal par lagaam lagane kii niyat se apil kiya he ki kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ko 2,000 rupee se adhik gumnaam chanda praapt karne kii ijaajat nahin honi chahie
 This offer of the Election Commission came after the Central Government informed the Lok Sabha that after demonetisation, no political party will have to check the currency of 500 and 1000 rupees deposited in the bank
 - ab maujuuda kanoon auranotbandike baad pratibandhit 500 or 1000 rupee kii karency ko jamaa karaane ke liye aae nirdeshon ke mutabik koi bhi registerd raajnneetik dal aasaani se kitna bhi paisa chaahe bank main jamaa kara sakate he
 - If the restricted currency deposited by political parties is less than Rs 20,000, then they do not need to give the details to the Election Commission
 vahiin vah karodon rupee kii rakam ko bhi yadi bataur chanda jamaa karaate hai to unpar tex nahin lagegaa
 Income tax law has taxed his entire income
 yaheen raajnneetik dalon kaa kaledhan se sidhaa conection hota he
 After the announcement of demonetisation, for those who cannot get black money in the country, it is the best option to give secret money to political parties
 vah chahen to is chande ke evaj main sattarudh raajnneetik dalon se apane hit main faisla kara le yaa phir chande main di gai rakam ke badale kuch paise nai karency main waapas le len
 - Section 13A of the Income Tax Act 1961 is behind this exemption given to political parties
 is kanoon ke mutabik raajnneetik dalon ko makaan or sampatti, dhan laabh athwa chande se hui kamai par tex nahin lagaaya jaataa
 It is clear from the exercise of demonetisation of the last 48 days that it has not caused any harm to political parties
 vah aaj bhi desh main kaledhan ke shrot ko chhipaane or use aage badhaane ke liye swatantra hai
 Now the Election Commission also believes that there is a need to bring transparency in this exemption given to political parties
 kya yah modi sarkaar kii chook nahin ki use notebandi kii kavayad shuru karne se pehle apane ghar (raajnneetik dalon) ko durust karne kii jarurat thi? kya notebandi se pehle raajnneetik dalon dwaara kaledhan ko sanchit karne ke raasto ko band karne kii jarurat nahin thi?

 It is alleged that Salman scrapped some offensive words on Shiva's SUV car, after which the accused got angry

 He participated in the Agenda Aaj Tak program on December 7, 2012, in which he promised that if his government is formed, terrorism will be eliminated from Pakistan within 90 days
 nae pakistan main dehshatgardi ke liye koi jagah nahin hogi
 Pakistan's land will not be allowed to be used for terrorism against India
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone yah bhi kaha, 'bharat aurapakistanmilakar kashmir samet sabhi aapasi vivaadit mudde sulajhaa sakate hai
 However, where India and Pakistan stand today
 isko dekhte hue yah kahana ki ham apane masale aasaani se hal kar lenge, yah bhi galat he, lekin itnaa jarur kaha ja saktaa he ki agar meri party kii sarkaar aati he, to ham in masalon ko hal kar lenge
 He also claimed, quoting three former foreign ministers, that the Kashmir issue had come close to resolving through the back channel, but could not for any reason
 unhone kaha ki ham samajhate hai ki yah masalaa hal ho saktaa he
 During this time he also promised that Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the Mumbai attack, would not be allowed to spew venom against India after his government was formed
 donon deshon ke bich vishwaas bahaali ke liye kadam uthaaya jayega
 When Imran Khan was asked how you would end terrorism from Pakistan within 90 days, he said that he would first of all end the US interference in Pakistan and take people into confidence, so that the terrorists do not provoke them by saying that the Pakistani army will fight the US Is fighting unhone kaha ki pakistan main 30 hajaar se zyada aatanki nahin hai, jinako aasaani se khatm kiya ja saktaa he

 The resentment of SC, ST and OBC before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections may outweigh the government
 ise dekhte hue sarkaar main manthan shuru ho gaya he or ucch shikshan sansthaaon main essi / asti or obisi ke aarakshan vyavastha main sudhaar ke liye adhyadesh laayaa ja saktaa he
 It is worth noting that on Tuesday, today many organizations have organized Bharat Bandh in protest against the new system of reservation with 13 point roster in higher education institutions
 kal yani 6 march, buudhvaar ko cabinet kii antim baithak he, kyonki iske baad loksabhaa chunaav kii ghoshnaa honi he
 Before this, PM Modi will have to decide on the issue whether to bring the ordinance overturning the Supreme Court's order of 22 January 2019
 sutron ke mutabik is bare main sarkaar ek adhyadesh laa sakati he ki vishvavidyaalaon main vibhagavar kii jagah santhaan waar aarakshan lagu kiya jaae
 The government may take a number of important decisions in the final cabinet meeting
 is baithak main hi sarkaar ucch shikshan sansthaaon main saamaanya varg ke garibon ko aarakshan pradaan karne ke liye 10 fisadi aarakshan ko lagu karne ke liye 4,000 karod rupee kaa atirikti fund aavantit kar sakati he
 In fact, Allahabad High Court had ordered to apply the institute-wise reservation with 13 point roster to fill the vacant SC / ST posts in educational institutions, whereas earlier this reservation was decided departmentally
 elahabaad hai court ke centre sarkaar ne supreme court main chunauti di thi, lekin supreme court ne bhi apane aadesh main is chunauti ko khaarij kar diya tha
 According to the order of the Allahabad High Court, the UGC issued a circular and ordered to apply institute-wise reservation in all higher educational institutions instead of department-wise
 is circular se esaysi / asti or obisi varg main gussa badhane laga
 In view of the anger, the central government asked the Union Social Justice Minister Thawarchand Gehlot to prepare a bill in this regard and by December he also prepared the 'central Educational Institution Direct Recruitment Bill'
 lekin yah bill thande baste main hi rahaa
 In view of the resentment of the upper castes on the issue of reservation, the government also passed a 10 percent reservation bill for the poor of the general class in January this year
 dalit or pichde varg main aarakshan kii nai vyavastha ko lekar kaaphi gussa he or ve sarkaar se is maamle main tatkaal ection chaahate hai
 He says that in the new system, there has been a decline of up to 50 percent in the recruitment of Dalit-backward
 duvidhagrast bijepi banaaegi santulanbijepi is maamle main kaaphi duvidha main he
 On the one hand, he has to remove the resentment of the Dalit-backward on the crucial occasion of the election, on the other hand, it is to be seen that the upper castes also do not get angry with it
 bijepi ke ek varisht netaa ne kaha, 'agar daliton-pichhadon ke aarakshan ke liye sarkaar bill lekar ai to saamaanya varg ke garibon ko jo 10 fisadi aarakshan diya gaya he, uskaa phayda bekaar ho jayega
 'therefore the government can take steps to balance
 yani ek taraf, dalit-pichhadon ke aarakshan vyavastha main sudhaar ke liye adhyadesh laayaa jayega or duusari taraf saamaanya varg ke 10 fisadi aarakshan ko lagu karne ke liye 4,000 karod rupee kii vyavastha kii jaaegi
 Human Resource Development Minister (HRD) Prakash Javadekar had said that 10 per cent reservation in educational institutions will be implemented from July 2019 session and for this the seats will be increased by about 25 per cent

 It is interesting to see that those who have till now seen reservation on social grounds like the antonym of talent and continue to consider it as a canker of the Indian system, they are appealing that this economic reservation should be accepted for the benefit of the poor - without it Describe under which criterion people who earn 65,000 rupees per month will be called poor
 ve bas 10 fisadi aarthik aarakshan ko garibon kaa jaays haq maanakar ise naukariyon or shiksha main jald se jald lagu karne ke haq main hai
 Even though no social reservation has been implemented so far in private sector jobs and educational institutions, now there is a rush of giving economic reservation there too
 kuch rajya sarkaron ne aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan kaa kanoon paas hote hi ise amal main laane kaa faisalaa bhi kar liya he
 And now HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar has said that economic reservation will be implemented in 900 government universities and 40,000 colleges in the country from this year itself
 yahi nahin, kareeb 350 nijee vishvavidhyalayon or 25,000 se zyaada collejon main bhi isi saal se aarakshan kii vyavastha lagu karne ke liye kanoon laayaa jayega
 Prakash Javadekar did not stop here, he made two more announcements
 unhone kaha ki in tamaam jagahon par 25 fisadi siten badhaai jaaengi, taaki pehle se chale aa rahe aarakshan par koi asar na pade
 The capacity of these institutions will also be increased for this
 ek-ek kar in sari ghoshnaaon ke peeche kaa sach dekhen
 Is the infrastructure of the government institutions in which 10 percent reservation is proposed to be increased to 25 percent seats, is it worth it to bear this additional burden? So far, almost all the reports show that in most educational institutions of this country, there is no provision to provide proper education to the existing students only
 videshon ke bade vishvavidhyalayon ke mukaable hamaare yahaan chaatr-shikshak anupaat bilkul dayaneey he - kahin-kahin to haasyaaspad
 The government is unable to fill this existing quota of teachers
 yahi nahin, shikshakon kii niyukti main jis saamaajik cote kaa dhyaan rakhaa janaa he, vah bhi kisi ko hasil nahin ho rahaa
 Then how will the magic of suddenly raising money for 25 percent additional seats in six months happen? Suddenly, how many appointments will the government make, how many new class rooms will be created, how many additional staff will be there? The situation here is that it is taking years to fill the posts that are being removed in the routine for government appointments
 lekin phir sarkaar 25 fisadi siten badhanaa hi kyon chaahati he? vah maujuuda chaatro main hi aarakshan kyon nahin dena chaahati? uski daleel he ki maujuuda cote par asar na pade, lekin aarthik aarakshan kaa jo samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak paarit kiya gaya he, usamen yah bahut spasht ullikhit he ki yah aarakshan maujuuda saamaajik aarakshan se alag hoga
 Obviously, the government is not bothered about the existing quota of those forwards, whose so-called poor forwards will fly
 zaahir he, sarkaar kaa yah hadabadaaya, aadha-adhuraa dabil pehle se pastahaal or sadhanvanchit sarkari collejon or vishvavidhyalayon ko kuch or badahaal karke chhod degaa, vahaan digriyaan bhale hi bantni shuru ho jaaen, lekin shiksha kaa kuch or tamaasha ban jayega
 It is not just about government educational institutions
 ab tak sarkaar ne is baat kii parvaah nahin kii ki nijee kshetra ke shikshan sansthaanon main saamaajik aadhaar par - essi-asti yaa pichde virgon ko - aarakshan kii baadhyataa kyon nahin he
 There is no reservation anywhere in these private institutions, but now that the law for the provision of 10 percent economic reservation has been made here, it is necessary that social reservation is applicable here too
 iske liye sarkaar bajet satr main bill laane kii baat kar rahi he
 It is really concerned about the economic reservation, not the social reservation
 kyonki use maaloom he ki in nijee sansthaanon main shiksha kii fis itani zyaada he ki zyaadaatar piaade tabakon ke log uskaa vahan hi nahin kar sakate
 But then how will the weak on economic grounds do it? The government will give them reservation, but will their fees be paid? Or request private institutions to pardon their fees? And will private institutions consider it? The decision of reservation in educational institutions is still entangled in court cases
 to sarkaar akhir chaahati kya he? kya uski hadabadai hui koshishen chizon ko or nahin bigaadengi? or kya nijee kshetron ke shikshan santhaan siten badhayenge, to apane yahaan niyuktiyaan bhi badhayenge? yaa ve pehle kii tarah hi apane shikshakon ko maanya kasautiyon se kam paise par niyukt karenge or jab chahenge, unhen nikaal denge?darasal bharat main puri shiksha ke saath-saath ucch shiksha kii vidmbanaaen bahut gahari hai
 Just as the government is not ready to increase its investment in primary education and is handing everything over to the private sector, the same work is also seen in higher education
 ham lagaataar ek rugn shiksha-vyavastha kii ore bad rahe hai, jisamen ek taraf to sadhano se laachaar sarkari santhaan hai or duusari taraf sarokaaron se vanchit nijee santhaan, jinhone shiksha ko dukandaaree main badal daalaa he
 Education does not appear in the government's priority list from anywhere
 shiksha uske liye naukariyon kii tarah hi bas ek zariyaa he, jisase vah alag-alag virgon ko lubhaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 His latest decisions will only increase these irony of education, but it is not meaningless

 Fights and disputes with neighbors are the biggest obstacles in its path

 padosiyon se rishte achche hone se maahaul behatar hoga or videshi niveshak bharat main nivesh karne ke liye aage aaenge, lekin agar halaat thik nahin honge to niveshak thithak jaaenge

 Regarding the growing trend of youth towards the dreaded terrorist organization ISIS, the religious leader said that this sequence is not right at all
 ise rokane ke liye alpakaalik or dirghakaalik yojana banaayi jaani chaiye
 On the question of the Uttar Pradesh government not allowing All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi to hold a public meeting, Madani said he did not agree with Owaisi's tone and thinking
 ovaisi desh or musalamaanon ke liye bhi achche nahin hai, lekin rajya sarkaar se ek sawaal he ki ovaisi kii hi tarah bolne vaale anya netaaon par pabandi kyon nahin lagaayi gayi he
 Former Rajya Sabha member Madani said in a conversation with reporters, "we all hope that India leads the whole world
" padosiyon ke saath jhagade or manmutav iske raste main sabase badi rukaawat hai
 We should support any effort to eliminate these obstacles
 ’ He said, 'prime Minister Modi's sudden visit to Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is a commendable effort in every respect
 agar ise jari rakhaa jaae to isse mulk kaa hi phayda hoga
 Due to good relations with neighbors, the atmosphere will be better and foreign investors will come forward to invest in India, but if the situation is not good then the investors will be stunned
 ’tippaniyan Asked if the Modi government at the Center is doing a good job, Madani said, "if pulses prices and inflation come down, then something can be said

 By the way, the Modi government has failed on more fronts
 ’ khoonkhaar aatankwaadi sanghathan iesas ke prati yuvaaon ke badhate rujhaan ke bare main dharmaguru ne kaha ki yah silsilaa katai thik nahin he

 Owaisi is also not good for the country and Muslims, but there is a question from the state government that why other leaders who speak like Owaisi have not been banned
 unhone kaha, ‘pradhanmantri modi kaa pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif se achaanak mulaakaat karne janaa har lihaaj se saraahneey koshish he

 The comments is vishwa cap main bharat ke saath aisa duusari baar hua
 In the first match, if such a pitch against the Kiwi team became the reason for the defeat, then this time Team India took advantage of Pakistan's lapse

 In the remaining matches, big scores are being made and they are being chased successfully
 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne bhi pich ke bartaav par aashcharya jataayaa unhone kaha, 'shuruyaat main mujhe nahin laga ki wicket itnaa turn legi

 (link in bio) a post shared by Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) on Jul 27, 2017 at 5:01 am PDT saalon se captain kool ke rup main jane ja rahe mahendra singh dhoni ko bangladesh main aakhir gussa kyon aayaa? kisi ko bharosa hi nahin ho rahaa tha ki ye vahi dhoni hai jinhen unke thande dimag ke liye janaa jaataa he
 What was supposed to be MSD from 'captain Cool', 'dhokbaaz Dhoni' has been done, Dhoni has now become 'dhokbaaz Dhoni' from Captain Cool and has lost 75% of his match fee in return
 lekin aakhir aisi naubat ai hi kyon, kyon aayaa captain kool ko gussa? darasal agar ham dhoni ke pichley kuch maichon ke score card par najar daalen to saaf ho jaataa he ki captain kaa balla unase ruthaa hua he
 That is why Dhoni, who has been playing captaincy innings with a cold mind like snow for the last seven years, boiled over Mustafizur Rahman and pushed him
 agar aankadon kii maane to dhoni ke test cricket se sanyas lene ke peeche bhi unki kharaab form hi jimmedaar he
 Does Dhoni remember his last match-winning innings? Dhoni's last memorable one-day innings was played against Zimbabwe at the start of the World Cup when he teamed up with Raina to win Team India by playing 85 not out innings
 world cap main hi dhoni ne westeindies ke khilaaf 45 ranon kii pari khelkar team ko jeet dilaai thi
 Apart from these two innings, it has been a long time for Dhoni to have played any match-winning innings, no one knows this better than him for one of the best finishers in ODI cricket
 ipel main bhi nahin chale dhoniyaha tak ki ipel main bhi dhoni 17 pariyon main sirf 372 ran hi bana paae jisamen unka sarvshereshth score 53 ran tha
 For a player of such height, it can be a matter of concern as well as anger on himself
 or dhoni kaa yahi gussa guruuvar ko maidan par dekhne ko mila jab unhone bangladesh kii taraf se padaarpan kar rahe tej gendbaaj mustafijur rahamaan ko dhakka de diya
 In Madhya Pradesh, the case of names of former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan's brother and other family members has caught fire in the list of farmers loan waiver scheme
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or mukhyamantri kamalnath ne ek raily main chouhan ke bhai ke aavedan kii prati laharaai or un sabake karj maaf hone kaa daawa kiya
 While Chauhan is claiming that his brother has not applied for loan waiver, his brother Rohit Singh Chauhan has declared the application as fake
 rahul gandhi ne buudhvaar ko gwalior main karjamaafee vaali suchi main shivaraj singh chouhan ke bhai rohit or chachaa ke ladke kaa naam hone kaa daawa kiya tha
 Chauhan was also accused of lying
 rahul gandhi ke aarope kaa jawaab dene chouhan guuruuvaar ko patrakaron ke saamne aae or kaha ki unke bhai rohit singh ne karjamaafee kaa aavedan hi nahin kiya tha, phir bhi karj maaf kar diya gaya, yah sajeesh he
 Why should Chief Minister Kamal Nath show such kindness to his (chauhan) family? Chauhan said while showing the government papers, it is clearly written that Rohit has not applied for loan waiver, as well as he is an income tax payer
 chouhan ne congress par aarope lagaaya ki vachan patr main kisaanon kaa do lakh rupee tak kaa karj maaf kiye jane kii baat kahi thi, ab congress apane vaade se mukar gai he or sirf fasal karjamaafee kii baat karne lagi he
 Chauhan's statement was overturned by Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Chief Minister Kamal Nath
 donon netaaon ne sagar sansadeey kshetra ke binaa main jansabha main chouhan ke bhai rohit singh chouhan va chachaa ke ladke ke karjamaafee aavedan kii prati ko saarvajanik taur par laharaaya
 Rahul Gandhi said that like Prime Minister Narendra Modi, former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Shivraj Singh Chauhan is also doing politics of lying
 rajya main congress kii sarkaar ne kisaanon kaa karj maaf kiya he, yah sach he
 The debt of Shivraj's family is also forgiven
 shivaraj ke parijanon kaa aavedan dikhaate hue rahul ne kaha, "ye unke parijanon ke aavedan hai, jisamen unke naam hai
 He was forgiven the debt and your former chief minister says that the debt has not been forgiven
 ab to jhooth bolnaa band kar dijie shivaraj singh chouhan"
 He went on to say, "when the Congress promised to waive farmers' loans in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, it was being said from where the money would come for it
 chouhan ke unke parivaar ke karjamaafee aavedan kii pratiyaan bheji jaaengi"
 Between the claims of Chauhan and Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Kamal Nath, Rohit Singh Chauhan came forward and said, "no loan waiver has been applied on my behalf, i am the income tax payer
 jo aavedan bataae ja rahe hai, vah farji he"congress ke varisht netaa suresh pachori kii aguwai main congress ke netaa purv mukhyamantri chouhan ke awaas par 21 lakh kisaanon kii suchi lekar pahunche the
 In this list, the names of those farmers whose debts have been forgiven
 is suchi main chouhan ke bhai va parijan kaa naam hone kaa sarkaar kii ore se daawa kiya gaya he
 It may be known that the state government had asked for three different applications for farmers' loan waiver from the farmers
 kisaanon ne panchayaton main apane aavedan jamaa kiye the
 On the basis of this, the government had claimed that there are debts of 55 lakh farmers in the state
 inamen se 21 lakh kisaanon kaa do lakh rupee tak kaa karj maaf kiya ja chukaa he
 Due to the implementation of the model code of conduct for the Lok Sabha elections, the process of debt waiver has stalled
 chunaav hote hi shesh kisaanon kaa karj maaf kiya jayega
 Great batsman Rahul Dravid has expressed his desire to become the coach of Team India
 unhone yah baat dilip saradesai smriti lacture dene ke baad kahi
 He also spoke on the issue of chucking and ODI cricket
 jab rahul dravid se team india ko coach karne ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, 'mere hisaab se har cheez kaa sahi vakt hota he
 i enjoyed my role as a commentator
 saath hi rajasthan royles ke menter kaa role nibhaana aanandadaayak rahaa
 Talking about the future, why would i want to become the coach of Rajasthan team in Ranji Trophy? 'mushkil main vandeis maukey par rahul dravid ne kaha ki khel ke teen praroopon main philhal ekadivasiy cricket sabase adhik apraasangik he or apana astitv bachaae rakhane ke liye jujh rahaa he
 He said more tournaments like the Champions Trophy or World Cup would have to be organized to make it relevant

 Why did former Punjab Chief Minister and senior Congress leader Captain Amarinder Singh want to contest against Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal? Why has the Congress changed its strategy all of a sudden in Punjab? It will be interesting to mention here the allegations of Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal
 kejariwal ye rat lagaate rahe hai ki congress or akali dal ke bich ranneetik samajhadaari he or ateet main bhi donon ek duusare kii madad karte rahe hai
 Kejriwal has alleged in his latest tweet that the captain is getting the expenses of the election campaign from Bikramjit Singh Majithia, who is also a relative of the captain
 kejariwal ne ye aarope bhi lagaaya kicaptanne teen saal pehle majithia ko sibiai jaanch se bachaaya tha
 Kejriwal has asked the captain in the tweet- 'sir, Badal had closed corruption cases against you a few months back
 kyon? punjab jaananaa chahta he ki kya deal hui thi
 'kejriwal has also claimed that the Akali Dal and Congress are contesting elections to benefit each other
 haalanki captain amarinder singh ne kejariwal ke aaropon ko khaarij kiya he
 But it is believed that it was because of Kejriwal's allegations that the captain decided to contest against Prakash Singh Badal
 darasal, aam aadmi party ke aaropon kii congress hawa nikaalnaa chaahati he, isiilie captain ko badal ke khilaaf khadaa karne kaa faisla kiya
 Standing against Badal will bolster the Captain's candidacy
 ye pehali baar he jabprakash singh badal ko amarinderki ore se unheen ke garh main chunauti di ja rahi he
 With this decision, where the allegations of the Aam Aadmi Party will be severely cut, Amarinder will emerge as a stronger Congress leader than before
 haalanki ye pehali baar nahin he ki captain kisi diggaj netaa ke khilaaf maidan main utre hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha election, the Captain won 1 out of Amritsar seat to senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley
 65 lakh voton se maat di thi
 Captain is going to challenge Prakash Singh Badal from the long assembly seat which has been the traditional seat of Senior Badal
 captain ne ravivaar ko kaha, main bujurg vyakti (prakaash singh badal) ko bataaungaa ki raajnneeti kya hoti he
 i am a warrior and do not like to lose
 main lambii or patiala se chunaav laduunga
 Badal is not the only politician challenged by the Captain
 captain ne AAP ke pramukh arvind kejariwal ko bhi chunaav main sidhe do-do haath karne kaa nyotaa diya tha lekin captain phir khud hi peeche hat gaye
 Kejriwal described Captain as coward in the tweet-war
 kejariwal ne kaha ki agar captain do jagah se chunaav ladate hai to ye kyrana kadam hoga
 Kejriwal said that the captain should only fight from a long seat and not from a safe seat like Patiala
 kejariwal ne amarinder par nishaanaa sadhate hue ek or twit kiya- 'sar, kya aap do siton se chunaav lard rahe hai yaa sirf lambii seat se
 People will call you coward if you decided to contest from both seats
 'sutron ke mutabik congress punjab main apni ranneeti badalte hue diggajon ke khilaaf diggaj ummidavaar kaa daanv khelnaa chaahati he
 The party had earlier decided to field Navjot Singh Sidhu against Sukhbir Singh Badal in Jalalabad and Ravneet Singh Bittu against Parkash Singh Badal in Lambi but Sidhu refused to fight Jalalabad
 aise main ab bittu ko jalalabad main sukhbir singh badal ke khilaaf utaara ja saktaa he
 Prakash Singh Badal will face a triangular contest in Lambi
 congress ke captain amarinder singh ke alaava is seat par aam aadmi party ke jaranel singh bhi taal thok rahe hai
 Congress can declare Captain from here in a day or two
 congress or aam aadmi party donon hi satta virdohi voton ko apni ore khinchne ke liye purajor koshish kar rahi hai
 The struggle will be intense, in such a situation that there is a possibility that the anti-incumbency votes can be split between the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party and this should be benefited by Senior Badal, who has won four consecutive elections from 1997 to 2012
 2012 main prakaash singh badal ko 55
 71 percent of the votes were received
 jabaki unke khilaaf utre congress ummidavaar ko 35
 Only 44 percent of the votes were received
 lambi ko badal kaa garh mana jaataa rahaa he
 These are the constituencies which have been given the highest priority in Punjab
 badal pita-putr ko apane apane nirvachan kshetron par fund kii barsaat karne ke saath anya phaayde dene ke liye bhi janaa jaataa he
 In other words, it will not be easy for the opposition parties to win the elections from the stronghold of the Akali Dal
 lambi main senior badal congress or aam aadmi party, donon ko hi kadi chunauti denge
 On the decision of Captain Amarinder to contest against himself, Prakash Singh Badal said that this is Rahul Gandhi's trick to get rid of Captain because he does not like Captain
 akali dal kaa maananaa he ki amarinder singh auservind kejarivalsirf gidad-bhabhakiyaan dene kii koshish karenge or party inkaa acchhee tarah jawaab dena jaanati he
 Badal said, 'captain Amarinder Singh is welcomed with both arms and i will enjoy his presence
 lekin main ummid karata hum ki wo apni suraksha main bina koi badlaav waapas ja sakenge
 On the other hand, Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal will also face a triangular fight
 unke khilaaf aam aadmi party ne sangrur se apane saansad bhagwant maan ko utaara he
 The Congress may soon field strong candidates against Sukhbir Singh Badal and Bikramjit Singh Majithia

 ham aapako kuch tips bataa rahe hai, taaki aap shaadi ke alag-alag functionon main alag-alag or aakarshith dhang se dressop ho saken
 
 
 
 1
 Mehndi - It is better to wear classic kurtapayajama of black or mehndi color or yellow colored kurta with white colored churidar in mehndi program
 zyada paaramparik functionon main pyjama ke saath kurta pahananaa hameshaa clasik luk detaa he
 However, this selection is for men who do not want to experiment too much with their looks and do not want to take the risk
 - agar aap bold lekin paarampariklukachahte hai to kurte ke saath nehru jacket aapako hatakar luk degaa
 Saif Ali Khan was first seen in it
 is luk main yakeenan aap shaadi ke function main chaa jaaenge
 - It would be appropriate to wear shirt and pants at work place and not in your best friend's mehndi
 isliye offis viyarkapadeis tarah ke functionon main pahanane se bachein
 2
 cocktail / sangeet- is kaarykram main shart or pant ke saath nehru jacket pahana ja saktaa he, lekin cocktail party main thodaa dark rang kaa paridhaan pahananaa upyukt hoga
 - If you wish, you can have embroidered shawls with kurtas
 3
 Wedding ceremony- For a long time men in India have been wearing sherwani with churidar as wedding dress
 duulhe kaa sabase acha dost hone ke naate aapke liye sherwani-chudeedaar shandaar vikalp ho saktaa he
 - Whether it is matching suit or wearing jacket and trousers, it is better to pay attention to fitness as well as being sensitive to style
 vahiin, zyada smart luk ke liye pocket square, lepal pins yaa bo taai yaa khubasurat broach laga sakate hai
 - Wearing jeans at the wedding would not be appropriate at all and neither should wearing a leather jacket
 is tarah ke paridhaan paaramparik functionon main pahanane se bachein

 raashtragan jan gana man par sawaal uthaane vaale elahabaad ke us nijee skool em
 a
 convent main taala latak chukaa he, jiske sanchaalak ne islam kii duhai dekar raashtragan kaa virodh kiya tha
 It has allegedly never sung a national anthem for the last 12 years
 sanchaalak jiyaul haq kaa samarthan kar rahe ek sthaneey parshad samet 7 logon ko police ne hiraasat main liya he
 School director Jiyul Haq has been sent to jail, a case of treason has been filed against him
 kahin tanaav na fail jaae isliye saydabad kii tang galiyon main piesi kii 2 or rapid ection force kii do dukadiyaan bhi tainaat kar di gai hai
 After the operator goes to jail, the future of 300 children is in limbo until the district administration makes a final decision on this school
 saydabad kii tang gali ke ek chote se skool main ek sanchaalak kii siraphiri soch ne puure ilaake main ek ankaha, ansuna tanaav bhi paidaa kar diya he
 Why did you listen to the words of the manager? By raising a question on a line of national anthem, 'bharat Bhagya Vidhata', Ziaul Haq has also put the Muslims living there in the dock
 'aaj tak' samvaadadaata ne jab gali ke is skool ko jaakar dekha to do chintaae logon ke chehron par saaf padhi ja saktin thi
 Every person, whether Hindu or Muslim, was angry to hear Jiyul Haq's talk, but the other anger was also on the fact that the talk of the operator of a small school in the street was so blamed
 sataane lagi bacchon kii chintaskul ke paas rahane vaale jubair ahamed kehete he ki raashtragan kaa apmaan hamen bhi bardaasht nahin he
 Ziaul Haq has embarrassed us, but the thinking of the operator is being punished by the children
 jubair ke bachche isi skool main padhate hai
 The fees for the next two months are also deposited, so now they have started worrying about the children
 skool ke thik saamne rahane vaale arshad kehete he ki yahaan har saal 15 agast or 26 janvari ko jhanda laharaaya gaya or raashtragan bhi hua he
 But we are also surprised at the thought of Director Ziaul Haq
 haalanki ilaake ke kai log isamen bhi siyasat kii sajeesh dekh rahe hai
 Why such a thinking is flourishing? The tension on the insult of the national anthem does not take another color, so the administration has deployed several companies of security forces throughout the region
 jile ke basic shiksha adhikari ne skool ko band karaane ke nirdesh jari kar die hai
 Alternative arrangements are being searched for all 300 children
 baharhaal bachche gharon main he, skool main taale latake he or gali main tanaav ko mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he

 Last time we missed a bit

 He also promised to take full care of Rajan's companions
 rajan ke sahyogi ne jald hi munh khol diya or bataa diya ki rajan australia ke newcastle main he
 Rajan survived after several attacks, after which Shakeel immediately sent the shooters from a country in the Middle East to Australia
 shakeel ko bharosa tha ki is baar rajan ko kisi bhi keemat par khatm kar diya jayega
 But this time also luck has betrayed Shakeel, because even one of Rajan's well wishers was informing Rajan about Shakeel's plan
 khabar milte hi rajan underground ho gaya
 In a few hours, Chhota Rajan left Australia and went to a place about which the 'piercing' who gave information to Shakeel was not known
