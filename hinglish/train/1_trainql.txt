 website 'da san dot ko dot euke' ke mutabik jab unke vivaah ke vishay main poocha gaya to stacy ne kaha, 'meraa jorge se vivaah karne kaa koi iraadaa nahin he

 ' chhattisgarh main ek raajnneetik uthapatak ke chalate purvamukhyamantriajit jogi kii saakh par sawalia nishaan lag gaya he
 Ajit Jogi has made a new announcement that now he will not contest against Chief Minister Raman Singh
 iske pehle jogi ne mukhyamantri raman singh ko chalange karte hue vaada kiya tha ki wo jahaan se bhi chunaav lade, unke khilaaf wo bhi chunaav ladenge
 Ajit Jogi became famous in the media after this statement
 unhone rajya ke lagbhag sabhi samachar patron main bhi surkhiyaan batori thim lekin achaanak shanivaar ko ajit jogi ne apane vaade se pallaa jhaad liya
 The official statement came from the Jogi Congress office that he would not contest the election but would campaign in all the assembly seats
 is bayaan ke baad jogi kii saakh or ranneeti ko lekar unke virdohi hamalavar ho gaye hai
 Ajit Jogi's new move in Chhattisgarh has not only raised questions on the credibility of the Janata Congress Chhattisgarh, but it has become common that the Chhattisgarh Janata Party is playing more than one stake in the state just to get a majority for the BJP
 
 raajnneeti ke pandit ab yahi maan kar chal rahe hai
 An authorized statement has come from the Jogi Party that they will no longer contest elections, but will campaign for candidates in all 90 seats
 is bayaan ke baad congress ne andeshaa jaahir kiya he ki bijepi or ajit jogi kii party ke bich gupt chunavi gathbandhan ho gaya he
 Ajit Jogiye has retracted his promises earlier, this is not the first time that Ajit Jogi has retracted his statement
 iske pehle bhi varsh 2013 ke vidhaan sabha chunaav main aisa hi bayaan dekar unhone raajnneeti garma di thi
 BJP has expressed fresh reaction to this decision of Jogi, saying that he could not muster the courage to enter the electoral arena against Chief Minister Raman Singh
 bijepi pravaktaa shrichand sundarani ne kaha ki apni saakh bachaane ke liye jogi ne mukhyamantri ke khilaaf maidan main na utarane kaa faisla liya he
 Once again, Jogi has played the same bet on the lines of the 2013 assembly elections
 unke achaanak pintara badalane se congress ne pratikriya jaahir karte hue jogi congress ko bijepi kii 'bi' team qaraar dete hue tikhaa hamalaa bolaa he
 Congress President Bhupesh Baghel has said that Ajit Jogi is in the electoral fray as the main ally of the BJP
 bijepi kii raah aasaan karne ke liye hi unhone bispi se gathbandhan kiya he
 Bhupesh Baghel further said that the decision not to enter the electoral fray against Chief Minister Raman Singh has been taken not by Jogi but on the bjp's instruction
 baghel ne kaha ki jogi congress, phase seaving ke tahat ise mahagathbandhan kaa faisla bataakar chhattisgarh kii bholi-bhali janata kii ankhon main dhul jhonk rahi he
 Congress leader Charandas Mahant also reacted to Ajit Jogi's decision not to contest from Rajnandgaon, saying that earlier he used to benefit the BJP by staying within the Congress, but is now openly benefiting
 unhone kaha ki bispi ke saath unka jagajaahir gathbandhan he , jabaki bijepi ke saath gopneey gathbandhan kar wo chauthi baar bijepi kii sarkaar banane main jute hai
 Charandas Mahant claims that Jogi will now play any tactic but Congress will form the government in the state
 udhar janata congress ke pravaktaa nitin bhansaali ne kaha he ki ajit jogi ne jab mukhyamantri raman singh ke khilaaf chunaav ladane kaa elaan kiya tha tab or abaki rajnatik paristithiyaan alag- alag hai
 According to him, at first the Janata Congress was in the fray for 90 seats alone
 lekin bispi ke saath gathbandhan ho jane ke baad paristhiti badal gai
 Chhattisgarh Congress President Bhupesh Baghel has allegedly created a political ruckus in the province on the call of Naxalite leader Ganapathi
 bhupesh baghel ne is phone ke peeche sattadhari bhaajapa va purv mukhyamantri ajit jogi kii party dwaara unhen naksali trep main fansaane kaa shadyantr qaraar diya he
 Bhupesh Baghel has expressed apprehension that there may be no third person in this conspiracy other than the BJP and Ajit Jogi's party
 isse pehle congress ke pradesh prabharee piel puniya ne jheram ghati cond ko lekar bayaan diya tha ki congressi netaaon par hue naksali hamale ke peeche ajit jogi kaa haath he
 According to Bhupesh Baghel, after this statement of PL Punia, a call in the name of a Naxalite leader gives rise to many doubts
 jisamen kisi badi sajeesh se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Baghel says that even before this there was a conspiracy to implicate him in the obscene CD scandal of the minister of state
 lekin vah or congress aisi sajishon se na darenge, na jhukenge or na hi rukenge
 On this statement of Bhupesh Baghel, BJP spokesperson Srichand Sundrani retorted saying that Baghel is flaunting the matter to remain in the headlines
 unke mutabik baghel ne ghatana kii likhit shikaayat pehle police main nahin kii
 But the media resorted to sensationalizing the case
 jab akhbaaron or media main surkhiyaan bator lee, phir police main likhit shikaayat darj karai
 Let us know that on Tuesday late evening, a person called Chhattisgarh Pradesh Congress President Bhupesh Baghel and introduced himself as Naxalite leader Ganapati
 lagbhag do minute kii is baatcheet me ganpati ne baghel se raajnneetik samikarnon par charchaa karte hue yah bhi kaha ki naksali congress kaa samarthan karnaa chaahate he
 And they are able to change the result of 37 assembly seats
 jiske baad baghel ne kisi badi sajeesh kaa andeshaa jataate hue is kathith naksali netaa ke saath hui baatcheet kaa puraa byora police ko diya tha
 Those who are fond of knowing and hearing about wild life will be excited to hear this news
 ham aapako bataa rahe hai ek aise jiraph ke bare main jo aam jiraph se bhi 4 guna lanbaa he
 This giraffe is Julu, which is 19 feet in length
 euke ke pembrowsher ke folli farmachidyagharamen rah rahe 18 saal ke julu ko philhal duniyabar kaa sabase lanbaa jiraph bataaya ja rahaa he
 In this zoo, there are three more matching giraffes with it, but its length is much more than all these
 haalanki iske rakrakhaav main jute logon ke paas isaki sahi lambaai naapane kaa koi tarika nahin he lekin jab vah 20 feet oonche daravaaje se bamushkil nikal paata he to isi se andaja lagaaya he ki vah 19 feet se kuch lanbaa he
 'julu' was brought to the Foley Farm from the Netherlands 5 years ago
 jo company ise yahaan lekar ai thi, use aise jaanwaron ko laane-lejaane kaa acha anubhav he
 But they too were surprised to see this tall giraffe
 folli farm se jude tim ne bataaya ki unhone ab se pehle itnaa lambaajirafanhin dekha tha
 Weight of julu 1
 3 ton he or is vajah se use uski marji ke bina hilaa paanaa aasaan nahin he
 Because of this, those who care for him are facing difficulty in measuring his actual length
 folli farm main aane vaale aksar julu ko dekhakar hairaan ho jate hai
 If he is the center of their surprise, Julu also has a friendly attitude towards them
 vah ek plateform par munh tikaakar aane-jane waalon ko dekhtaa he or jab ve use haath lagaate hai to usko yah acha lagata he
 Tim, who oversees Julu, says that despite being larger in size than a common giraffe, Julu's behavior is quite restrained and he lives in harmony with other giraffes
 jahaan tak khaane kii baat he to julu ko 20 kilo ghaas rojaanaa di jaati he
 However, apart from this regular diet, he also needs to eat 2-3 kg extra
 mashware kii shakl main farmaan aayaa he
 Reminding that such suggestions have been given from time to time
 usee kii parampara main 1995 main cabel act kii yaad dilaai gai he or kaha gaya he ki sabhi tivi channel aisi saamagree dikhaane se bache jisase hinsa bhadak sakati he
 Violence can be provoked
 jo rashtravirohi nazariye ko protsaahit karata he
 Which affects the integrity of the country
 sabhi channelon se aagrah kiya jaataa he ki in dishanirdeshon kaa sakhti se paalan karen
 It does not say that this order is about the Hindu Muslim debate on the channels for five years or Assam
 When the order came, the people of Assam were on the streets
 naagarikta kanoon paas hone ke pehle se assam kii uniwarsity main jabardast virodh ho rahaa tha
 Apart from Assam, this law is also being opposed in other areas of the Northeast
 soochna mantralay saaf saaf likh detaa he ki vaise to sara godi media assam ke pradarshnon ko nahin dikhaa kar rashtrabhakti kaa pradarshan kar hi rahaa he, ham chaahate hai to ki do chaar channel jo kabhi kabhi dikhaa rahe hai wo bhi rashtrahit kaa naam lekar assam kii reporting na karen
 Do not discuss
 kya assam ke logon kaa pradarshan jaays nahin he? kya unka pradarshan raashtra virdohi he? to sarkaar pehle assam ke pradarshnon ko rashtravirohi ghoshit kar de? channelon ke dikhaane se assam main hinsa nahin ho rahi he
 Their anger has been fueled by the non-availability of channels
 agar unhen lagata ki unki baaten desh ko bataayin ja rahi hai to itani naaraazgi na hoti
 All the protests in Assam remain peaceful till the Rajya Sabha passes
 tair jalaakar pradarshan karnaa or raat main mashaalen lekar juluus nikaalnaa na to hinsa he or na hi rashtravirohi pradarshan
 If Assam protesters make the mistake of committing violence, it is the responsibility of the government that it did not talk to these people
 abhi jab pradarshan ho rahe hai tab bhi inase koi baat nahin kar rahaa he
 Are these orders not to show the movements of Assam? No one will say yes, but you can now understand the silence about Assam coverage on the channels
 rahi baat aap janata kii
 Whichever you want
 agar aapako lagata he ki yah aadesh sahi he to aap apane maujuuda or bhavishya main hone vaale sabhi pradarshnon ko rashtravirohi ghoshit kar sthagit kar den
 Declare yourself as anti-national too
 ganna kisaanon ko kaan pakad kar khet main baith janaa chahie ki unase raashtra virdohi galati hui he ki unhone daam na milane par andolan karne ko sochaa or media se aagrah kiya ki dikhaa dijie
 There are so many civilian groups who will be on the road to take their troubles
 utre hi honge
 What is the meaning of such orders? Godse is said to be great within Parliament
 kya wo raashtra virdohi gatividhi nahin he?naagarikta kanoon kaa virodh vaid he
 Happened in Parliament
 sadak par bhi ho rahaa he
 The Indian Express has written in its editorial that the law is poisonous
 ise sadan main hi roak diya janaa chahie tha
 Now the judiciary will have to show its faith in the defense of the Constitution
 hindi akhbaaron ne phir se hindi pathakon ko morrkhtaa ke andhere main dhakele rakhane kii zimmedaari nibhaai he
 How long will you remain locked in a room of hatred and ignorance
 insaan kii fitrat mohabbat hoti he
 His passion is knowledge
 vah zyaada din hindi akhbaaron ke qaid main nahin rah saktaa he
 See this editorial of AAP Express
 hindi akhbaar dainik bhaskar kii khabar kii hedline dekhie
 Loved ones and Assam is different
 bich main ek or nahin he kya wo apana nahin he? aap yah khel samaj paa rahe hai ?yah kanoon sanvaidhanik mulyon or naitiktaaon par khara nahin utarataa he
 The majority does not have the right to say this
 sirf assam virodh nahin kar rahaa he
 Protests are taking place in many parts of the country
 kai sanghathan or vyakti virodh kar rahe hai
 Many political parties are protesting
 kya ve sabake sab rashtravirohi qaraar de die jaaenge?soochna prasaaran mantralay ko apana naam angrezi main information blocade ministry rakh lenaa chahie
 Ministry of Information dissemination in Hindi
 yaa phir jorge orvel kii kitaab 1984 se sidhe uthaakar ministry of truth rakh lenaa chahie
 Channels should be switched off and put telescopes in place, under which it should be written - Big Brother is watching you
 orvel ke 1984 main jo mantralay yatnaa detaa tha uskaa naam ministry of hepiness he
 The Ministry of Truth is the one who spreads lies
 orvel kii kalpana bharat main saakaar hoti dikh rahi he
 The reference to the 1984 Ministry of Truth in Hindi means that you will be enslaved or have been made
 aap vahi sochenge or utana hi sochenge jitna sarkaar aapako bataaegi
 Thinking more than that, the government will keep an eye on it
 zyaada jaananaa or zyaada sochna gunaah hoga
 Don't you see this happening almost the same way? godi media kuch or nahin
 Are part of the Ministry of Truth
 aap hi bataaen ki in channelon par soochna kahaan hai, aapke hi virodh pradarshnon yaa sawaalon kii koi soochna he? jab media sarkaar kaa ang ban jaae, uske adeshon par jhukne lage tab logon ko sochna chahie ki aap is media ko apana vakt or paisa kyon de rahe hai?ek naagarik ke taur par aapaki kya zimmedaari he? kya aap yah manzur kar rahe hai ki kisi chiz kaa virodh na dikhaaya jaae? kya aap manzur kar rahe hai ki virodh pradarshan na hon? kya aap manzur kar rahe hai ki sarkaar jo kahegi vahi sahi hoga? aap apni naagarikta ko hi khatm karne kii manzuri de rahe hai
 Which will be heavy on you
 aapaki chuppiyaan ghaav ban jaaengi
 One day pus will come out
 aap dard sahan nahin kar paaenge
 Use discretion kuch sochie
 What has happened is not right
 in daraaron se kya milegaa?kashmir par aap chup rahe hai
 You are silent on Assam
 jis hindu musalmaan ko gar hane main gaate rahe ye dikhaane ke liye aap nafaraton se upar hai, us musalmaan ko is kanoon main chhod die jane se aap chup hai
 Your song was just a show
 kal kisi or rajya yaa samudaay ko lekar chup rahenge
 If you spend one day on your own, the bid will not come out
 isliye loktantr main bolne ko hameshaa protsaahit kiijie
 Support the speakers
 coment baks main gaali dene waalon ko dekhakar darane kii zarurat nahin he
 These are the soldiers of Happiness in the ministry

 Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has once again defended the government over GST
 saath hi unhone congress ke un aaropon ko bhi sire se khaarij kiya, jinamein chunaav ke maddenjar tex rate main raahat dene ke daawey kiye gaye hai
 Jaitley also said that linking this decision to elections is 'childish' politics
 arun jetali ne ye tippanee aise vakt main kii he, jab congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi gujarat main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan lagaataar jiesti par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 On the recent Gujarat tour of Rahul Gandhi, where he said that under pressure from the people of Gujarat, the Modi government had to change the GST rates
 vahiin ye bhi maang uthaa rahe hai ki unhen 5 nahin, balki ek tex slab chahie
 Jaitley's replyjetli said, "those who are seeking a single GST rate are not aware of the tax rate structure
 khaadya utpaadon par tex shunya hoga
 Goods consumed by the general public will have to be placed in the lowest tax slab of five per cent
 ' jetali ne kisi kaa naam liye bina kaha ki jo single tex slab kii baat kar rahe hai unhen 'jiesti kii praathmik jaankaree' bhi nahin he
 Jaitley gave this clarification Congress may be looking at Modi government's decision related to Gujarat elections, but Jaitley has denied it
 unhone kaha he ki sarkaar jiesti main raahat ke liye teen-chaar maheene se kaam kar rahi thi
 In such a situation, linking the decision of relief in GST to any election or political demand is 'childish politics'
 itnaa hi nahin jetali ne jiesti ko lekar congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke ek slab vaale formule ko khaarij kar diya
 He said that there is scope to further improve the tax rate but any decision regarding this will depend on the revenue coming from GST
 bataa den ki jetali kii adhyakshata vaali jiesti parishad ne pichley saptaah 178 vastuon par tex rate ko 28 pratishat se ghataakar 18 pratishat kar diya he
 Some other products have been kept in the lower tax rate range
 sarkaar ke is faisle ke baad congress ise gujarat chunaav ke dabaav main liya gaya faisla qaraar de rahi he
 Soon after this decision, senior Congress leader and former Union Minister P
W
 chidambaram ne nirnay ke turant baad hi thankyuu gujarat kahkar faisle ko gujarat chunaav se jod diya tha

 'jaaniye kalam ke bare main 10 khaas baaten:1
 APJ Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 in Rameswaram in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu
 2
 Kalam, a sailor by profession, was not well educated
 ye machuaaron ko naav kiraaye par diya karte the
 To run a family of five brothers and five sisters, the father's money was scarce, so to continue his early education, Kalam also had to sell newspapers
 4
 From the age of eight, Kalam used to get up at 4 in the morning and take a bath and go to study mathematics
 subah naha kar jane ke peeche kaaran yah tha ki prayek saal paanch bacchon ko muft main ganit padhaane vaale unke teacher bina nahaye aae bacchon ko nahin padhaate the
 After coming from tuition, he used to offer Namaz and after that he used to distribute news papers at Rameswaram railway station and bus stand till eight in the morning
 5
 Kalam tells Subrahmanyam Iyer, his fifth class teacher, to get into 'aerospace technology'
 wo kehete hai, ‘wo hamaare achche teachers main se the
 Once he asked in class how the bird flies? If no student of the class answered it, the next day they took all the children to the beach
 vahaan kai pakshi ud rahe the
 Some were coming down to the sea and some were sitting
 vahaan unhone hamen pakshi ke udne ke peeche ke kaaran ko samajhaayaa saath hi pakshiyon ke sharir kii banaavat ko bhi vistaar purvak bataaya jo udne main sahaayak hota he
 These things explained by him were so ingrained in me that i always felt that i am on the beach of Rameswaram and the incident that day inspired me to set the goal of life
 baad main maine tay kiya ki udaan kii disha main hi apana kariyar banaau
 i later studied physics and studied aeronautical engineering from Madras Engineering College

 Missiles named Prithvi, Trishul, Akash, Nag were made

 The picture you are seeing above is the Sangam Park area of model Town Assembly Constituency
 
 
 vaise to sangam kaa matlab hota he do nadiyon kaa milan, lekin yahaan nadiyaan nahin, ghar ke neeche gandi naaliyon kaa milan zarur dekhne ko mil jaataa he
 
 
 Sangam Park, which looks clean from outside, is made of hell by 'naughty' drains from within
 
 
 ilaake main teen block hai, or 1,600 makaanon main lagbhag 15,000 log rahete hai
 
 
 Near the staircase outside almost every house you see dirty drains from which dirty water reaches the houses, but forced people cannot go anywhere, and despite many complaints, the situation has not changed
 
 
 logon kii kai or samasyaayein bhi hai
 
 
 Drinking water is getting dirty here for the last few months, and there is so much dirt in that water that you become ill as soon as you drink
 
 
 upar di hui tasviir aap dekh sakate hai
 
 
 The water that is visible in the bucket is the water supplied for drinking, and the residents here first have to throw about 10 buckets of water, then some clean water, which is visible in the bottle
 
 
 lekin yah bottle vaala pani bhi pine laayak nahin he
 
 
 It is dirty, it smells bad too
 
 
 log ise nahaane or kapade dhone main istemaal karte hai, or pine ke liye pani khareednaa padataa he
 
 
 The picture you are seeing is of the area around the railway track originating near Sangam Park
 
 
 trek ke aasapaas kareeb 1,000 log rahete hai
 
 
 These people are not native here, but have been living here for the last 15 years
 
 
 voter card bhi bane hue hai or vot dete bhi hai, lekin inaki samasya ko lekar koi gambhir nahin he
 
 
 There is so much dirt spread in these places that if the health of the people worsens every day, then one has to even go to the hospital
 
 
 kai baar paisa nahin hone kii vajah se yahaan ke log desi dawaaiyon se bhi kaam chalaa lete hai
 
 
 You will feel as soon as you see such a picture of the Model Town Assembly Constituency of Delhi, perhaps our leaders will not be aware of this problem and hence there is no solution, but the truth is not
 
 
 logon kaa kahana tha ki samasya kaaphi puraani he
 
 
 No matter what the government is, the problems remain the same
 
 
 har chunaav se pehle rajaneta ilaake main aate hai or bade-bade vaade karke chale jate hai, lekin chunaav jeet jane ke baad in logon ko bhul jate hai
 
 
 But still the people here win these leaders with a new hope in every election, but their problem is not solved
 
 
 is baar dilli vidhansabha chunaav se pehle har party kaa ummidavaar yahaan aayaa tha or inaki samasya ke samaadhaan kaa vaada kar gaya tha
 
 
 Before the election, candidates of every party were coming here about three to four times every week, but after the election, the arrival of anyone here has almost stopped
 
 
 is ilaake ke vidhayak akhileshpati treepathi ke paas yahaan ke log kai baar samasyaayein lekar gaye hai, lekin koi samaadhaan nahin mila
 
 
 Even if the MLA comes here, hoisting the flag or attending any function
 
 
 bijepi ke madhavaprasad yahaan pichley nau saal se nigam parshad hai, lekin unhone bhi koi hal nahin nikaala
 
 
 People used to say that when people go to Madhavaprasad with a problem, they get the answer, that you have not voted us, go to those who have voted
 
 
 kai baar yah jawaab tak diya gaya he ki hamen aapke vot kii zarurat hi nahin, ham uske bina bhi jeet sakate hai
 
 
 This time, candidates of every party had come here before the Delhi Assembly elections and promised to solve their problems
 
 
 chunaav se pehle har hafte lagbhag teen-chaar baar har party ke ummidavaar yahaan aa rahe the, lekin chunaav ke baad yahaan kisi kaa bhi aana lagbhag band ho gaya he
 
 
 The MLA of this area, Akhileshapati Tripathi, has taken many problems with people here, but no solution was found
 
 
 agar vidhayak yahaan aate bhi hai to jhanda fahraane yaa kisi function main shirkat karne
 
 
 Madhavprasad of BJP has been a corporator from here for the last nine years, but he too did not find any solution
 
 
 logon kaa kahana tha ki jab log samasya lekar madhavaprasad ke paas jate hai to jawaab miltaa he, ki aapane hamen vot nahin diya he, jinhen vot diya he, unheen ke paas jaaie
 
 
 Many times it has even been answered that we do not need your vote, we can win without it

 Now it will be cheaper to take room in small and budget hotels in Delhi because the Delhi government has changed the luxury tax limit
 iske baad ab dedh hajaar rupee pratidin ke kiraye vaale kamaron par lagjri tex nahin lagegaa
 Earlier, this rule was applicable to rooms rented up to Rs 750
 somvaar kodillividhansabha ke vishesh satr ke pehle din lagjri tex sanshodhan bill pesh kiya gaya
 Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodiany introduced this bill in the House
 is vidheyak main sansodhan kar dilli sarkaar ne lagjri tex slab main badlaav kiya he
 According to the new Delhi government proposal, the slab of tax has been increased from Rs 750 to Rs 1500
 yani ab hotalon main 1500 rupee tak ke kamare lene par koi tex nahin dena hoga
 Small and budget hotel operators have long demanded that the tax slab be changed because the imposition of luxury tax on small and low-cost hotels would increase tariffs and affect hotel business
 is badlaav se hotel maalik or graahak donon ko phayda hoga

 After the 2014 assembly election results, Mufti Mohammed Saeed showed no haste to sit at the helm of power and now, after his death, daughter Mehbooba Mufti is also following in her father's footsteps
 siyaasi dalon se lekar rajbhavan tak milane-milaane or baithkon kaa daur jari he, jabaki sarkaar kaa cheharaa kya hoga isko lekar koi khaakaa saaf-saaf khinchaa nahin gaya he
 Recall that even after the election results on 25 December 2014, the situation regarding the formation of the government was not clear and then Governor Vohra announced the Governor's Rule in the state on 9 January 2015 amidst the political outcry
 tamaam raajnneetik napha-nuksaan kii padtaal ke baad pidipi-bijepi main gathbandhan hua to mufti mohammad ne 01 march 2015 ko bataur mukhyamantri shapath grahan kiya tha
 Nearly a year later, on 9 January 2016, Governor Rule is in force in the state and nothing is clear from the alliance to the government's appearance
 samajha ja rahaa he ki pidipi kaa ek dhadabijepi se gathbandhan ke khilaafahai
 While Mehbooba Mufti's stance on BJP has never been particularly good
 vahiin, bijepi netaa ram madhav ne ravivaar ko media se rubaru hote hue kaha, 'is samay pidipi netritv aage kii sarkaar kii vyuharachna banane ke liye milane vaali he
 i will be able to say something only after knowing what their strategy is
 ' bijepi netaa ne aage kaha, 'hamen puraa vishwaas he ki jo mufti sahab kaa vijan tha, ham use puraa karenge or sarkaar chalaayenge
 "is Mehbooba Mufti angry? Sources are reported that Mehbooba Mufti, who took over the reins of PDP after the father's death, is angry with BJP
 khabaren to yahaan tak aa rahi hai ki unhone sarkaar nirmaan ko lekar bijepi ke saamne kuch sharten bhi rakhi hai
 These include everything from the share of large portfolio PDP in the state to bypassing sensitive issues
 duusari ore, bijepi se jude sutron kaa kahana he ki rajya main nae sarkaar ke nirmaan ko lekar pehle bijepi ne apni ore 'roteshnal siem' kii maang rakhi, lekin dabaav kii ranneeti main uljhi party ab yathasthiti banaae rakhane ko bhi taiyaar he
 However, BJP MLA K
 rabindra raina ne donon dalon ke bich kisi bhi tarah kii naaraazgi kii khabaron ko khaarij kiya he

 com / kghq4ca1no— ANI (@ani_news)january 10, 2016isse pehle, ravivaar din main srinagar main congress upaadhyaksh sonia gandhi or kendriya mantri nitin gadakari mahabuuba mufti se milane pahunche
 Although both leaders said that Vemufti had come to meet Mohammed's death as a condolence, the political meaning of the meeting is also being extracted
 saaf sanket hai ki pidipi ek saal pehle kii tarah hi gathbandhan kii sarkaar banane se pehle har formule or har vikalp ko acchhee tarah parakh lenaa chaahati he
 The equation of seats in the state is also something where a new relationship can be written if there are scattered relations
 chaar din ke shok ke baad saaf hogi surat!gauratlab he ki sarkaar banane main ho rahi deree ke kaaran pradesh main shanivaar se governor rule laga diya gaya he
 Governor NN Vohra wrote a letter to both PDP and BJP parties last Friday to clarify the situation about forming the government
 pidipi ne kaha tha ki mahabuuba pita ke choharam (chaar dinon ke shok) ke baad sarkaar sanbhaalanaa chaahati hai or isliye philhal mukhyamantri pad kii shapath nahin lenaa chaahatin
 What the BJP says according to the gazette sources, after the fourth of Saeed, the governor can hand over the letter to the governor to support the new government
 jammu-kashmir vidhansabha kii baat karen to yahaan 87 sadasyon vaale sadan main pidipi ke 28, jabakibijepike 25 vidhayak hai
 44 seats are needed to form a government
 baaki partiyon main congress ke paas 12, neshnal conference ke paas 15, sipiai (em) ke paas 1, jammu-kashmir pipuls conference (jeckepisi) ke paas 2, jammu-kashmir pipul dremocratic (secular) ke paas 1 seat he, jabaki 3 siten swatantra hai

 For the first time, a person came forward to say that these four companies, in whose name the Aam Aadmi Party has received a donation of 2 crore rupees in April 2014, are not fake, but all four companies are his own
 uttar purvi dilli ke ganga vihaar main rahane vaale mukesh sharma ne enditivi india se kaha he ki ye chaaron companiyaan meri hai

 Mukesh Sharma said that he did not want to get into political trouble, so when the matter came up two years ago, the media did not come forward

 i donated because i felt that he had come to do something good in politics
 tippaniyan NDTV India asked the question that when the matter was raised two years ago, when reporters were going to the address of these companies, no one was getting it, so Mukesh Sharma said that for the first time this company was suspected of being fake
 If there was any kind of dispute, we did not want to fall into it, so we had said in those places that no one came and refused, so no one got anything, but now 3 out of 4 companies in Karaval Nagar Not registered in the Alipore Narela

 The new leader of China's Communist Party, Xi Jinping, said that the only way to progress the country is Chinese-specific socialism
 saath hi unhone party ke adhikariyon ko maao-tse-tung ke mushkil daur kii yaad dilaai
 At the workshop of the new Central Committee members, Xi said, "we will look for the truth in the facts and tell what is important and what is not
" ’teng shiyaomping dwaara chini vishistataa vaala samaajwaad hi ek rasta he jise har lihaaj se sampann samaaj taiyaar karne or samaajawaadee aadhunikeekaran badhaane ke liye apanaaya ja saktaa he

 maao ke baad satta sanbhaalane vaale teng ne 31 saal pehle chini vishistataa vaale samaajwaad kii pariklpana aage badhaai thi
 Xi said the reform turned out to be a historic decision and said that the progress made by China in the past decade made it the second largest economy in the world
 shi philhal up raashtrapati hai or vah hu jintaon kii jagah party ke nae mahasachiv chune gaye

 Especially the Congress party has started to question whether the budget will be presented or not
 congress ne kejariwal sarkaar kii is deree par use aade haathon lete hue kaha he ki arvind kejariwal ko shashan chalaane kaa hi anubhav nahin he
 Due to this constitutional crisis has arisen in Delhi
 dilli vidhansabha kaa satr aagaamee shuukravaar se hone ja rahaa he, lekin ab tak sarkaar or naa hi adhikari bajet seshan ko lekar jaagruk dikhaai de rahe hai
 In such a situation, opposition parties are getting an opportunity to question the timing of Kejriwal government

 continental ne jari bayaan main kaha tha ki america ke liye flite chalaane vaali sabhi america airlines duniya ke zyaadaatar deshon main iskaa paalan karti he, isamen kisi bhi tarah kii dheel sambhav nahin he
 Officials of the Independent Human Rights Commission in Kandahar and Kabul have also confirmed the incident
 tippaniyan (input from AFP) (input ffp se) (input from AFP) aisi kai media reports saamne aa chuki hai ki pradhanmantri karyaalay (PMO) ko punjab neshnal bank (PNB) ghotaale ke 31 janvari 2018 ko khulaasa hone se pehle hi hira kaarobaari mehul chokasee kii vittiya gadabadiyon kii kathith taur par jaankaree thi
 Reports said that the PMO also made a list of complaints received from the people and these were sent to the ministries and related agencies
 jaanch agenciyon ke alaava vitt or grih mantralay se ye pataa lagane ke liye kaha gaya ki mehul chokasee ke khilaaf koi jaanch lambit he yaa uske khilaaf kabhi koi karrwai kii gai
 These reports said that all this was happening in 2017 when Mehul Choksi's application for citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda was under investigation
 PMO kii ore se bheji gai chitthiyon kaa pataa lagane ke liye 'india today' ne soochna ke adhikaar (RTI) act ke tahat PMO ko hi yachika bheji
 We asked 'did the PMO send a letter to the Ministry of Home Affairs to find out whether an investigation is pending against Choksi in 2017 or any action taken against him? If the answer is yes, a copy of the letter and a copy of the reply sent to the PMO by the Ministry of Home Affairs should be provided
 ’pehle sawaal par piemo se ye jawaab mila-‘aavedak kaa sawaal khaas inputs maangane kii jagah chalate-phirte (rowing) poochtacha he
 The information sought is not clear
 “isliye artiai act 2005 ke section 6 (1) or section 2 (f) ke praavdhaanon ke tahat aavedak ne jo jaankaree maangi he wo soochna kii paribhaasha ke tahat nahin aati
 "," And answering the second question is also 'not appropriate' in the context of the answer to the first question
 oxford dictionari ke mutabik rowing kaa matlab lagaataar yatra karnaa hota he bina kisi jauntavya (manzil) ko tay kiye hue
 Roving can also be replaced with a stroller
 cambridge dictionari main rowing kaa matlab ek jagah se duusari jagah kii yatra karnaa he
 It is beyond comprehension why PMO used the word roving? And it is not clear how to ask that the PMO had written a letter to the Ministry of Home Affairs asking if any investigation was pending against Mehul Choksi in 2017 or any action was taken against him? Due to dissatisfaction with the answer, the PMO again Appeal was filed in is apil kaa ‘es ech rizvi, diarector and apillet athurity’ se jo jawaab mila wo is prakaar he
 “I checked the records related to this case
 ye paaya gaya ki aapke sawaal is tarah taiyaar kiye gaye jo ki prashnawali kii prakruti ke hai jisamen maamle main PMO ke rukh ke sandarbh main karrwai kaa stats jaananaa chaha gaya he
 It has been clarified that the information sought is roving (on-the-go inquiry) and not specific (specific)
 isliye CPIO, PMO kaa stand yahi he ki jaankaree maangana artiai act, 2005 ke tahat soochna kii paribhaasha main nahin aata or is sambandh main diya gaya jawaab sahi he
 "it seems the PMO has used the 'roving inquiry' (on-the-go inquiry) jumle to cover up or ignore the issue
 vipaksh kii ore se modi sarkaar par neerav modi or mehul chokasee ke desh se bhaag jane ko lekar lagaataar prahaar kiye ja rahe hai
 The Congress alleges that the PMO ignored complaints against Mehul Choksi and 'made it easy' for him to flee the country
 is prishthbhumi main chitthee ko saarvajanik karne se sarkaar ko or sharmindagi kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa tha
 It seems that the right to take information of the citizen has been given 'roving'
 artiai ke tahat soochna lenaa lagata he ki is baat par nirbhar karata he ki jisase sawaal poocha ja rahaa he, uski asuvidha kaa str kitna ooncha hoga
 When questioned by the PMO, the right to information has been roving from its scale
 bijepi pravaktaa mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne kaha he kinarendra modi ji yamraj hai,pehali baar congress ne sahi baat boli he

 (gaia Mother) (@sofiahayat) on Mar 2, 2017 at 2:09am PST The Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission selected 48 engineers for the state's rural development department 32 years ago
 inhen assistant ejeeniyar ke pad par tainaati mili
 The first 20 years of the job were cut very comfortably
 lekin 2001 main jab in ejiniyaron kii varishthata suchi banane kii baari ai to inamen se kaiyon kii janmatithi main gadabadi pai gai
 When the original documents were searched for investigation, only the files related to his appointment were found missing
 adhikari sakate main aa gaye
 Files were searched everywhere, but the result was cipher
 vibhaag ne filein khojane main chaudaa saal lagaae
 Finally, on February 13, the special secretary of the department, Chhotalal Pasi, lodged a report against unknown people in connection with the missing files at Hazratganj police station in Lucknow
 yahaan ejiniyaron kii niyukti se judi filein gum huin to kanpur nagar nigam main ve 400 filein nahin mil raheen jinke aadhaar par ek lakh ru
 House tax was to be levied or more
 afasaron ne house tex main golmaal kar na keval nagar nigam ko rajasav kshati pahunchaai balki filein bhi chipa deen
 This was revealed when Municipal Commissioner Umesh Pratap Singh issued an order on 21 January calling for all such files, including Rs 1 lakh
 se adhik ke house tex kii demand kii gai thi
 The municipal corporation is now preparing to go to the police shelter, but the force of the police is lying on the ground for some other reason
 uttar pradesh rajya audyogic vikaas nigam (upiaceidisi) ke daagi chif ejeeniyar arun mishra kii niyukti sambandhi file hisicurity vaale sachivalay se gaayab ho gai he
 Following the High Court's strictness, the police also arrested Harendra Tiwari, Assistant Review Officer of the Secretariat, on 28 December, but the file is still missing
 darasal, uttar pradesh kaa koi bhi sarkari vibhaag aisa nahin he, jahaan se kam-se-kam darjan bhar jaruri filein gaayab na hui hon
 Maintenance of files still remains a challenge in the high-tech region
 shashan str par upi ke sabhi vibhaagon main har din 100 se zyada nai filein banati hai, lekin puraani filon kii nigaraanee kii koi vyavastha nahin he
 That is why the game of missing files is going on in government departments
 dedh dashak main bigade halatvarsh 1999 tak pradesh sachivalay ke sabhi 369 anubhaagon main kam-se-kam ek sandarbh daata yaa reference clerk tainaat tha
 Their job was to list, monitor and file all the files in the concerned section and if any matter comes up, file it to the concerned officer
 1999 main sabhi sandarbh daataaon ko pramotion dekar samiksha adhikari bana diya gaya
 Since then, the system of monitoring files collapsed
 krishi utpaadan ayukta karyaalay main tainaat ek upasachiv bataate hai, '' sachivalay ke daftaron main filon ke rakrakhaav kii koi durust vyavastha nahin he
 Some conscious review officers are doing the work of referrers
 pichley maheene krishi utpaadan ayukta ke saath baithak main adhikariyon ne sandarbhadaata kii vyavastha dobaaraa behaal karne kaa prastaav rakhaa he
 "to monitor the files disappearing from the secretariat, the government has started bar coding of files in sections of the irrigation department
 baar code scinar se code ko scan karne par puri file kii soft copy computer ke saamne aa jaati he
 Prabhat Mittal, Secretary, Secretariat Administration, says, "all sections of the government are being modernized, which has improved the system of monitoring files
" ''dupliket file kaa khellokayukta or satarkta vibhaag ne shashan ko karrwai ke liye kai filein bheji thim, lekin ye sambandhit vibhaag se gaayab milin
 If strictness was done, the departments made a duplicate file, but the Chief Secretary, Alok Ranjan, ordered an inquiry and stopped their plans from climbing
 bispi shasankaal ke dauraan sachivalay main tainaat ek sachiv str ke adhikari ke paas ek aisi file ai jo pratikul tippaniyon se rangi padi thi
 To avoid taking any decision on this, the officer closed the original file in the cupboard and decided by writing a comment on the duplicate
 vastav main kisi bhi gaayab file kii keval 50 se 60 fisadi hi dupliket (riconstitute) file banaai ja sakati he
 The Chief Secretary's Office has prohibited the opening of duplicate files i

 Keep in mind that this was Australia's first win on England soil, no one in England was able to digest this defeat, perhaps that's why a satirical obituary was published in 'the Sporting Times' newspaper in line with public sentiments
 isamen bataaya gaya ki english cricket kii maut ho gai he, uskaa antim sanskaar kiya jayega or raakh (ashes) ko australia le jaaya jayega
 Then in 1882–83, when England went to Australia to play the Test series, it was said that the English team was going to bring back the same Ashes under the captaincy of Ivo Bligh, the English media gave that tour to the Ashes Defined as regaining seizures
 iseaustralian cricketki raakh kaha gaya
 This was a personal gift for Bligh, so it was never made the official Ashes trophy

 Telugu Desam Party (TDP) President n Chandrababu Naidu is trying to unite opposition parties to form a 'national Front' to defeat the Narendra Modi-led NDA in the Lok Sabha elections 2019
 naidu vipakshi dalon ke saath 10 disambar ko dilli main baithak karne ja rahe hai
 However, earlier TMC chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and TRS President and Telangana CM KCR have also taken initiative to form National Front
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki aakhir naidu kii koshish mamata-kesiar se kitni alag he?endie se naata todakar alag hue naidu ne congress ke saath gaiyr-bijepi dalon ko lekar neshnal front banane kii pahal kii he
 Not only this, his party is contesting elections along with Congress in Telangana assembly elections
 naidu ne vipakshi dalon ke netaaon ke saath mulaakaat kaa silsilaa bhi congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi se milakar shuru kar chuke hai
 Naidu said in an event on Thursday that the Congress-led UPA would be part of the proposed National Front
 itnaa hi nahin, unhone kaha ki endie ke kuch dalon ko bhi neshnal front main shaamil karaane ke liye aamantrit karenge
 Naidu said that the National Front would be a consortium of political parties, in which the parties associated with the UPA would also be a part
 iske alaava kai aisi partiyaan hai, jo na to upie or na hi endie kaa hissaa hai
 It is our attempt to connect them with this front too
 jabaki, tiemasi pramukh mamata banerjee or kesiar jo neshnal front banane kii kavayad shuru kii thi, usamen congress ko hissaa nahin banaaya gaya tha
 Mamta met Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi in the last, after meeting leaders of opposition parties
 wo chaahati thi ki unke front ko congress samarthan karen or saath hi saath jo dal jis rajya main majboot hai, vahaan par uske netritv main chunaav ladaa jaae
 At the same time, KCR had started the exercise to form a coalition of non-congress and non-bjp parties
 isi maddenjar unhone aise hi dalon ke netaaon ke saath mulaakaat kar saath aane kaa nyotaa diya tha
 In any case, KCR did not want to make Congress a part of his alliance
 isse saaf jaahir he ki mamata jahaan congress se samarthan chaahati thi
 At the same time, KCR was engaged in forming alliances without Congress
 jabaki in donon netaaon se alag chandrababu naidu congress ko lekar vipakshi dalon ko ekajute karne main lage hai
 In such a situation, the question arises that how successful Naidu is in his efforts? punjab main rahul gandhi kii raily ko lekar akali dal ke netaaon kaa gussa rahul gandhi or congress ke prati lagaataar badhata hi ja rahaa he
 It is worth mentioning that on 10 October, a cancer satellite hospital was inaugurated by Rahul Gandhi and Union Health Minister in Sangrur, Punjab
 is udghaatan main punjab ke mukhyamantri samet akali dal ke kisi bhi netaa ko nahin bulaayaa gaya tha
 Unhappy with this, Chief Minister Badal wrote a letter to the Prime Minister, calling it a wrong tradition and against the relations between the Center and the states
 lekin akali dal kaa gussa isse bhi shant nahin hua he
 So now the Akali Dal has announced that the Akali Dal leader will hold a bigger rally than the rally of Rahul Gandhi in Sangrur, exactly where Rahul Gandhi did the rally
 saath hi is raily main hospital ke liye inishiative lene ke liye sukhbir badal or prakaash singh badal ko gold medal dekar sammanit bhi kiya jaayegaa
 Akali Dal's public servant Prem Singh Chandumajra has said that all the work has been done by Badal Saheb for the construction of this hospital
 rajya sarkaar ne muft main jameen bhi di he or health rajya sarkaar kaa masalaa he, lekin congress ke logon ne yahaan galat parampara daali he
 Badal sahib was not even called, so now the Akali Dal will hold a big rally from the Congress at the same place and will also give Prakash Singh Badal a gold medal
 dilli ke vidhansabha chunaav main jeet se utsahit aam aadmi party ne narendra modi ke vikaas ke daavon ke khilaaf morcha khol diya he
 The party has started a 'bhadu Yatra' from Ahmedabad on Sunday to highlight corruption in Modi's rule in Gujarat
 yah yatra ganatantr diwas ke maukey par desh kii aazaadee main aam aadmi ke taur par adarsh ban hissaa lene vaale indu chachaa kii pratimaa sthal se shuru kii gai
 The 'broom journey' started in Ahmedabad by journalist-turned-party spokesperson Ashutosh
 yah yatra 30 janvari ko gandhinagar ke mahatma mandir par khatm hogi
 Party workers from different cities of Gujarat will participate in this trip
 yatra kii shuruyaat karte hue ashutosh ne kaha, 'modi gujarat main vikaas kii baat kar rahe hai, lekin ye vikaas kisi ek insaan kaa nahin he
 The Congress is yet to declare its candidate in front of Narendra Modi, but will field a strong candidate who will give an equal contest to Modi
 
 
 
 And the tricolor stuck in the door, Ashutosh and party workers who came to unfurl the tricolor in Ahmedabad came at a time when the tricolor got stuck in the door

 Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, one of the country's senior Dalit leaders, says the atrocities on Dalits in Una were a 'minor incident'
 lok janashakti party ke pramukh paswan gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ke liye ghar-ghar jaakar prachaar ke liye utre he
 According to the Times of India, here he said in a conversation with media persons, i want to say that small incidents keep happening
 hamaare bihar main bhi aisi ghatnaayen hoti he
 a small incident happened in Gujarat
 
 
 una (ghatana) hui
 There was a lot of uproar in Gujarat
 
 
 lekin sarkaar kaa kaam he karrwai karnaa
 Whenever such an incident occurs, what steps are taken after that is important
 paswan ne kaha kigujaratbharat kaa centre bindu he or use garv hona chahie ki desh ke sabase lokapriy pradhanmantri is rajya se he
 Paswan's statement about the Una incident has been criticized by Jignesh Mevani, the convener of the Rashtriya Dalit Adhikar Manch and emerging as a Dalit face in the state
 unhone ise 'sharmnaak bayaan' qaraar dete hue paswan ke istife kii maang kii he
 Mevaneine said, "paswan's statement that the atrocities on Dalits in Una is a small incident is shameful and like sprinkling salt on the wounds of Dalits who were beaten up and driven into the city
 is ghatana ko lekar rajya bhar main hue virodh pradarshan ke dauraan kareeb 30 daliton ne jehar kha liya, sadaken or rail line thap raheen
 This was a ruthless incident
 ham yah maang karte hai ki is tarah kaa sharmnaak bayaan dene vaale paswan ji kaa bijepi istipha le
 However, when Paswan was asked to try to justify the beating of Dalits in Una in July 2015 as a 'minor incident', he clarified that 'atrocities on Dalits cannot be justified
 meraa kahana he ki piem modi pehle hi saarvajanik manch par kah chuke hai ki gorakshakon kii kisi bhi samaaj virdohi gatividhi ko bardaasht nahin kiya jayega
 ' garbhvatee hone ke saath hi garbhvatee mahila ko salaah or nuskhe bataane waalon kii bheed jute jaati he, jinamein se kuch salaah or nuskhe vaaki kaam ke hote hai, lekin unamem se zyaadaatar andhvishwaas or suni-sunai baton par aadhaarit hote hai
 Pregnant women, undergoing physical and mental changes at such times, always have an inner fear and this fear forces them to accept these misconceptions
 myth-1
 a child born to a beautiful woman in front of a pregnant woman is also born beautiful
 vaastaviktaa-darasal, aisa kuch bhi nahin he
 The nanoparticles of the fetus in the womb depend on the gene
 haa, jahaan tak sundar bachche kii tasviir ankhon ke saamne lagane kii baat he, wo is lihaaj se acha he ki acchhee tasviir dekhakar garbhvatee mahila ko acha mahasoos hota he or aisi sthiti main khush rahanaa kaaphi ahm hota he
 Myth-2
 saatven maheene ke baad nariyal pani pine se bachche kaa dimag bhi nariyal jitna bada ho jaataa he
 Reality - This is completely wrong
 aashcharya to is baat kaa he ki ye baat ai kahaan se
 Actually, coconut water is rich in potassium, but in no way is it responsible for the size of the brain
 myth-3
 White should eat first morsel in the morning
 isse bachche kaa rang gora hota he
 Reality - This is also a very big myth in itself
 jaisaa ki ham pehle hi bataa chuke hai ki garbh main palane vaale bachche kaa rang-rup jin par nirbhar karata he, aise main aap chaahe safed khaaen yaa phir kaala bacch ke rang par koi asar nahin padataa he
 Myth-4
 grahan ke dauraan garbhvatee mahila ko chhip janaa chahie or kisi bhi prakaar kii gatividhi se bachanaa chahie
 During pregnancy, women are advised to sit quietly in the room during eclipse
 par sochane vaali baat ye he kii grahan ek nishchit prakriya he or iskaa bachche ke janm par koi bhi prabhaav nahin padataa he
 However, this does not mean that the eclipse should be viewed nonchalantly but with the naked eye, this applies not only to pregnant women but to everyone
 myth-5
 The size of the womb reveals the sex of the baby
 vaastaviktaa-ye bhi apane aap main ek bada hi dilachasp myth he
 The size of the womb tells about the baby's position in the womb
 garbh ke aakaar kaa bachche ke ling se koi conection nahin he
 Myth-6
 maa kii rangath se bachche ke ling kaa pataa chal jaataa he
 Reality - Actually, the color of a pregnant depends entirely on her hormones
 garbhavastha ke dauraan mahilaon ke harmens main kaaphi badlaav aate hai, jisaki vajah se jahaan kuch mahilaon kii rangath nikhar jaati he to kuch saawali ho jaati hai or kuch aisi bhi hoti hai, jinke chehre par dhabbe ban jate hai
 It is really a myth to tell the child's gender
 myth-7
 Excessive consumption of ghee, butter and oil makes a child comfortable
 vaastaviktaa-aisa kuch bhi nahin he
 Ghee is not helpful in making baby's child comfortable
 balki inke ati seven se sharir main calories kii maatra kaaphi adhik ho jaati he or ek baar bachche kaa janm ho jane ke baad use kam karnaa kaaphi mushkil ho jaataa he
 Myth-8
 garbhvatee mahila ko apane niyamit aahaar se doguna khaanaa chahie kyonki use sirf apane liye nahin bachche ke liye bhi khaanaa hota he
 Reality - This is probably the most common myth, but not entirely true
 mana ki aapke bachche ko aapse hi poshan miltaa he, lekin iskaa matlab ye nahin ki aap apane aahaar se doguna aahaar len
 Pregnant women should increase their daily diet by 300 calories and should try to eat more nutritious food than oily food

 It is to be seen now how much Raina's performance on the field improves with this philosophy of temples

 vahiin, sabhi ke man main ek ajeeb sa utsaah hilore letaa hua gaanv-gaanv, gali-gali bhojpuri lokgeeton ko gaaya jaataa he
 On Nag Panchami, which falls in the month of Savan, a special enthusiasm prevails over the entire Purvanchal, and especially the young girls and newly married girls sing a Bhojpuri folk song with their friends, taking high strings of swings on the trees
 sawan ke jhule ke saath gaaye jane vaale geeton main sanyog or viyog ras ke geeton kii bharmaar rahati he or saath hi radha krishna ke prasangon kaa zikr bhi in geeton main bharpoor paaya jaataa he
 In this month, Suhagan wants her loved one around her and she does not like the month of Sawan without her dear
 
 "hum na na bhave ho saavan bina sajnava ho nandi"
 
 
 to kahin jhulon par jhulati saji sanwari yuvatiyaan ‘‘radha sang main jhula jhule banavaari he goia’’ or ‘‘gheri gheri aayi gata kaari kaari sakhiya’’ ke geet kaanon main amrit ras gholte he
 These ancient traditions are diminishing in today's modernist, bhagaur and urban culture, but even today it has special significance in the villages of Purvanchal

 bharat samet duniyabar main aarthik susti kaa daur chal rahaa he
 In this environment, the price of gold is also increasing worldwide
 agar bharat ke sandarbh main baat karen to sone kaa bhav 39 hajaar rupee prati das gram ke kareeb he
 On Thursday, gold prices rose by Rs 150 to reach a new high of Rs 38,970 in Delhi Bullion Market
 yah ab tak kaa sabase mahangaa bhav he
 Similarly, the price of silver has also crossed the price of 45 thousand per kg
 aise main sawaal he ki aarthik susti kii haalat main sone kii demand kyon bad rahi he
 Let's know the whole matter
 
 Why the price rises Actually, gold is considered the best means of safe investment
 aise main jab bhi niveshkon ko aarthik halaat thik nahin lagate tab vah sone ke nivesh ko praathamikta dete hai
 The result is that the demand for gold increases
 sone kii demand badhane kii vajah se keemat main ijapha hota he
 Apart from this, there is more buying in the domestic market, even then the price of gold rises
 khaastaur par tyohaari sijan main sone kii kharidari bad jaati he
 At the same time, the policies and decisions of the government also have an impact on the price of gold
 bharat main kyon mahangaa ho rahaa sona1
 There are many reasons for the rise in gold prices in India
 pehla sabase bada kaaran aam bajet main sone par sarkaar kaa faisla he
 In fact, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while presenting the general budget last July, increased the import duty on gold from 10 percent to 12
 5 fisadi kar diya he
 Gold trade has declined sharply due to increase in import duty
 bataa den ki bharat gold kaa bahut bada ayatak he
 It imports more of its needs

 The second biggest reason for the rise in the price of gold is the continuous repo rate reduction by the RBI
 vaise repo rate main katautee kaa aam logon ko sidhaa phayda to miltaa he lekin apratyaksh rup se sone ke bhav main badhotaree bhi isi vajah se hoti he
 Actually, a cut in the repo rate means that banks will now be able to take loans more easily than RBI
 iske baad bainkon main paison kaa pravaah badhegaa
 Then the bank will give a loan in the market
 is puri prakriya main paison kaa pravaah badhegaa
 The result will be that institutions and common people will invest their money to buy gold
 isse sone kii demand or keemat donon badhegi

 agar do-chaar dinon ko chhod den to aam bajet ke baad se bhartiya share bazaar kii sehat bigadati ja rahi he
 In the last May, after the results of Lok Sabha elections, the Sensex, which has crossed the figure of 40 thousand, is currently trading below 37 thousand
 isi tarah nifti bhi 12 hajaar se ludhak kar 10 hajaar 700 ke str tak aa gaya he
 Not only this, in the month of July, the Indian market has performed the worst in 17 years
 bazaar ke jaankaron ke mutabik aam bajet main vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne videshi nivesh par sarcharge lagane kaa elaan kiya tha
 Since then, the stock market has become worse
 is susti kii vajah se niveshak apane share bechak sone main nivesh par jor de rahe hai
 Obviously, the price has also increased due to increasing demand

 a major reason for the rise in the price of gold in the country is the global political crisis
 darasal, vaishvik str par america or china ke bich tanaav barkaraar he
 Recently, the US has imposed import duty on Chinese goods
 vahiin china par apni karency yuan ke saath chhedchhad ke aarope lage hai
 In these circumstances, there are indications of harsh response from China
 in sabhi halaaton ne bhi niveshkon main bhay kaa maahaul banaaya he
 In addition, concerns about the global economy have also scared investors
 bataa den ki antarrashtriya mudra kosh (IMF) ne global economic growth rate kaa anumaan 3
 5 minus 3
 3% kar diya he
 Will the price increase? Experts say that the price of gold may increase in the coming days
 darasal, desh main tyohaari sijan aa rahaa he
 Gold demand is expected to increase this season
 agar aisa hota he to sone kii keemton main ijapha hoga or yah 40 hajaar ke aankade ko paar kar saktaa he

 upi ke noida main police ke haath ek aisa gang laga he, jo pichley 17 varshon se lagjri gadiyon par haath saaf kar rahaa tha
 This Girog used to sell stolen vehicles in the northeastern states of India
 yahi vajah thi ki is giroh ke shaatir chor itane varshon main kabhi police ke haath nahin lag paae

 Police have found out in the investigation that there are dozens of cases against these thieves in NCR
 yah gang dilli main hi sakriya tha
 The people of this gang are so vicious that they used to keep fake Icards of government departments to avoid any kind of trouble
 police ne kul milakar 6 shaatir chor giraftaar kiye hai
 The gang used to steal only luxury cars and then sell them in the northeastern states

 Just like the budget, the common citizen keeps expectations every year, but along with the common people, high profile celebs are also going to be on the budget
 pichley kuch samay main narendra modi sarkaar or cinema ke kai rasukhdaar logon ko saath dekha gaya he
 In South Mumbai too, Narendra Modi inaugurated the film museum at the Film Division property and many Bollywood stars were seen photographing with PM Modi
 modi ne apane pehle kaarykaal main cinema udyog ke liye kuch ghoshnaaen kii thim
 The cinema industry is also expecting some relief from the Modi government this year
 bataane kii jarurat nahin ki film industry rojgaar dene ke maamle main kaaphi agrani kshetra rahaa he
 According to Consultancy Deloitte, in 2017, the Indian film industry employed 2,50,000 people, whereas four years ago the number was just 160,800
 yahi vajah he ki sarkaar bhi is industry kii growth se utsahit he
 To eliminate piracy, the Modi government has also introduced an anti camcording provision in the Cinematograph Act
 bharat har saal 2
 5 billion dollars is lost due to online piracy
 bhartiya rupee main ye rakam bahut badi he
 Every year the earnings of many filmmakers of the country are affected due to piracy
 anti camecording ke sahare piresi par lagaam lagane kii koshish hogi
 Although how effective this step will be, it will tell the time to come
 Nirahua@jadoozhara tehsil main ek cinemapiche
 twitter
 com / yf1qpgki0q— Nirahua Hindustani (@nirahua1)june 27, 2019modi sarkaar ne apane pehle kaarykaal main ek or mahatvapurn concept bhartiya filmkaaron ke liye shuru kiya tha
 Announcing the single window clearance in the interim budget in February, Piyush Goyal had said that single window clearance was previously available only to foreign filmmakers
 lekin ab ye bhartiya filmkaaron ke liye bhi uplabdh hoga
 With this, filmmakers will not have to take permission from place to place for shooting all over the country and shooting can be started after all the paperwork is approved by a final authority
 isse filmmekars kaa kaaphi samay or energy bachegi or filmein banane main kam adchane aaengi
 Since the arrival of multiplex culture, the prices of middle class and lower middle class tickets have been questioned every time
 sarkaar ne 100 rupee se adhik kii tikat par 18 pratishat jiesti ghataakar 12 pratishat kar diya tha
 At the same time, 28 percent GST was imposed on less than 100 tickets to 18 percent
 haalanki film industry se jude log isse bhi khaas khush nahin he
 The industry is expecting further concessions from the government
 pichley kuch saalon main multiplex culture ke panpane or single screen theatres ke khatm hone kagaar tak pahunchne ke baad se kshetreey filmon ko kaaphi nuksaan ho rahaa he
 Not only Bollywood but also many small cinema markets of Bhojpuri, Punjabi and other Indian languages are facing the shortage of theaters
 aise main single screen theatres par focus jaisi kuch chizein hai jiske chalate kshetreey cinema ko gro karne main madad mil sakati he
 Bhojpuri actor Nirahua, who contested the elections from Azamgarh, has also started initiatives in this regard
 ve haal hi main lakhanu main ek program main shaamil hue the jiskaa focus tha har tehsil main ek cinema
 Nirhua is trying to launch single screen cinema in every tehsil in his state for Bhojpuri films with the help of this program
 party kii sarkaar hone se unke prayaas ke achche nattejey mil sakate hai
 The lack of theaters in every region can lead to a good business in film production and distribution
 sarkaar ko bhi is bare main pahal kerani chahie
 So that the monopoly of big budget films on screens ends
 agar screens kii suvidha hogi to chote bajet or kshetreey bhashaa kii filmon ko bazaar milegaa
 It is obvious that the production of films will accelerate and a cinema will reach a wider audience
 bharat main iskaa phayda sabko milegaa

 madar tak to baat thik thi
 Even the law had no objection to her becoming Mother India, but when she read the book of enemies of the law to her eight children instead of the law, she became God Mother herself, then the eyes of the law were twisted
 iske baad tajirt-e-hind kii sari dfaayen jab ek-ek kar wo todane lagi to uske aage baaki chate hue badmaash bhi boune hote chale gaye
 This story is of a mother or god that God Mother kept Dillipulis for a long time

 What is the name and address, they will tell later, first of all, know why it is under the police's custody
 is mahila ke khilaaf hatya, lutpaat, supaari, rangadari, kidnaping, phiroti, chori, dakaiti or naa jane kya kya maamle darj hai
 Counting fingers will get tired but the acts of its crime will not be reduced
 kul milakar isladi donke khilaaf 113 maamle darj hai
 For this reason, this woman is a Delhi Police chemist wanted officer
 puure ilaake menladi donka aatankainake naam ke aage jo urf lagata he

 thodaa jhuk kar chalati he
 You will be shocked if you know the reality of this elderly woman
 supaari lekar logon ko maut ke ghat utaarna iske liye chutkiyon kaa kaam he
 There is no such crime in the list of the world of crime which is not recorded in their names
 or ye mahila mashhoor hai ye mummy ke naam se

 police record main basheeran kaa naam kuch aise hi darj he
 Basheran has serious cases like murder and recovery

 Their names are Sameer alias Gumba (42 cases), Shakeel (15 cases), Advocate (13 cases), Rahul Khan (3 cases), Faizal alias Khadka (9 cases), Sunny (9 cases), Salman (2 cases)
 And he has a son, a minor

 Her arrest also came when she was trying to get the house sealed
 don kii giraftaar se khush hai logbashiran kii giraftaar ke baad ilaake ke log raahat kii saans to le rahe hai
 But still people are not opening their mouth against him
 yahaan tak ki pados main rahane vaale log bhi uske bare main ek lafz bhi bolne ko taiyaar nahin
 The crackdown on Basheran started when in January this year, he kidnapped a boy and placed him in the forest near the house
 uski hatya karwaane kii koshish
 But the police reached in time and rescued the boy
 apharan ke baad kii thi hatya kii koshishtab pataa chalaa ki naa sirf is vaardaat ke peeche balki pichley saal miraj naam ke ek ladke kii hatya karwaane or use vahiin dafan karwaane ke peeche bhi basheeran thi

 Actually, Basheran entered the world of crime in 2002
 gang banane ke liye use kiraye ke gundon kii jarurat hi nahin padi
 Because there were eight sons in the house
 apane aathon beton ke saath usne dekhte hi dekhte puure ilaake main dehshat failaa di
 Alam was that Basheeran had captured the water pipeline of the water department in his area
 haalanki police kii karrwai ke baad basheeran kaa sindicket khatm hone laga he

 The dispute started between the two top officials and reached the Supreme Court

 The select committee consisted of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the leader of the largest opposition party in the Lok Sabha, Congress Mallikarjun Kharge, and Supreme Court Justice AK Sikri (nominated by the CJI)
 is cameti main pradhanmantri narendra modi or supreme court ke justise eke sikri ne alok verma ko hataane ke paksh main faisla diya tha, jabaki mallikarjun khadge unhen pad par barkaraar rakhane ke paksh main the

 Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta presented his case on behalf of the Enforcement Directorate (ED)
 tushaar ne court kaha ki agency ke paas saamagree thi, aaropon ke khilaaf or chidambaram se poochtacha bhi hui
 He then filed an anticipatory bail petition in the High Court
 tushaar mehta ne kaha jo tathy agency ke paas hai vah paryaapt hai
 He enumerated the names of Vijay Mallya, Mehul Choksi and Zakir Nayak, who had escaped from the country and the scandal under the PMLA over the years
 tushaar mehta ne aage kaha ki piemele yaa anya main koi aisa praavdhaan nahin
 Along with giving the material collected in connection with the charges to the court, the accused parties should also be provided
 idi kii taraf se mehta ne yah bhi kaha ki chidambaram kanoon se bachakar faraar bhi ho gaye the
 He was avoiding investigation, but now he wants relief from Chidambaram court
 tushaar ne kaha ki idi ko chidambaram se poochtacha kerani he
 Evidence has to be verified and witnesses have to be confronted
 ye koi tivi intervyuu yaa sawaal jawaab kaa satr nahin hota he
 It is an investigation of scam and conspiracy
 kanoon isaki ijazat nahin detaa ki jaanch ke is daur main chidambaram ke saath dastauez yaa jaankariyaan saajha kii jaaen
 Tushar said that the money trail of 15 payments deposited abroad is with the agency
 ye jaankaree agar vah aaropee se saajha kar le or aaropee ke agar 30 trail hon to vah paisa thikaane lagane or sakshya mitaane main jute jayega
 The truth can be revealed only when the accused is confronted with the facts
 tushaar ne kaha ki saakshyon ko aaropee paksh ke saath kis had tak saajha kiya jaae yah purna adhikaar agency ke paas hota he
 Providing documents related to evidence during the demand for anticipatory bail can spoil the case
 hamane aaropee ko vishesh adaalat ke saamne pesh kiya, agar hamane aaropee ke saath bura vyavhaar kiya hota to wo adaalat main apni baat rakh saktaa tha
 If Chidambaram's plea is accepted, other matters will be affected

 isse pehle 2007 ke chunaavon main congress 16 siten jitkar sabase badi party bani or sarkaar banane main safal rahi

 lagata he ki 2015 main bihar ke mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ne nayaa avatar le liya he
 He is trying to establish himself as a person who is self-reliant and combative
 maanjhi ne 6 janvari ko ek jatke main rajya ke 18 iees adhikariyon kaa tabadalaa kar diya or purv mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke chahete maane jane vaale kareeb sabhi naukarshahon ko darkinar karte hue dalit afasaron ko nirnaayak padon par baitha diya
 With this decision, it seemed that Manjhi had taken some administrative lessons from Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati
 mayawati jab bhi uttar pradesh kii satta main ain, unhone dalit afasaron ko ahm padon par baitaane kaa kaam kiya
 This administrative reshuffle, however, was only a small beginning to Manjhi's comprehensive plan
 ab tak nitish kumaar ke bharosemand maane jate rahe maanjhi ne 7 janvari ko aae patna hycourt ke us faisle kaa bhi swaagat kar daalaa jisamen nitish ke khilaaf khadey hue jedy (you) ke chaar baagi vidhayakon kii sadsyta khatm karne ke vidhansabha adhyaksh ke faisle ko khaarij kar diya tha
 This decision is considered to be counter to Nitish in political circles and by welcoming it, Manjhi has not only broken the official line of his party but by doing so he has also won the trust of some anti-nitish mlas in the party
 jabaki isse pehle tak maanjhi ko ek aagyaakaari pyaadaa yaa kathputli tak mana ja rahaa tha
 After the JD (U) shock in the Lok Sabha elections, Nitish Kumar had to bear the brunt of martyrdom and as a result, in May 2014 Manjhi was put on the chair of the Chief Minister
 tab se lekar pichhlaa saal khatm hone tak nae mukhyamantri maanjhi ko mote taur par ek aagyaakaari sevak kii bhoomika main hi dekha ja rahaa tha
 Working towards the administrative goals set by Nitish Kumar, Manjhi felt no harm in working with Nitish's bureaucrats in 2014 and looked quite satisfied
 jedy (you) ke ek bade netaa kehete hai, “maanjhi ne kabhi bhi saarvajanik taur par nitish kumaar ke khilaaf ek shabd bhi nahin kaha he
 But his decision on this decision clearly shows that he is in the fight to take over the Chief Minister's crown forever
 ” maanjhi aaj ek aise netaa ke taur par ubhar kar saamne aae hai jo apni bhoomika ko sirf bihar vidhansabha chunaav tak simit nahin maan rahaa, balki ve to apni vyapak bhoomika par nigaah banaae hue hai
 Even though many people within JD (U) expect them to be limited
 sawaal uthta he ki maanjhi ne achaanak pintara kyon badla he? isaki vajah jahiraa taur se vakt ke takaaje main dekhi ja sakati he
 There is strong speculation that Manjhi will be removed from the post of chief minister after the mutual merger of the old Janata Parivar parties as both Nitish Kumar and RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav agree that Manjhi will stop the BJP in the state
 Neither politically strong nor administratively reliable
 chah partiyon ke janata parivaar kaa vilay takreeban tay dikh rahaa he haalanki ab bhi kuch prakriyaagat aupchaariktaayen baaki hai
 As such, the election symbol of the new party has not yet been agreed
 bhale hi isamen kuch or vakt lag jaae lekin bihar main jedy (you) or argedy ne kaarygat ekta kaayam kar lee he or donon vidhansabha chunaav ke liye milakar jute gaye hai
 With less than a year left in the state assembly elections, both Lalu Yadav and Nitish are brainstorming on the leadership of the government after the merger
 is bare main vichaar kiya ja rahaa he ki maanjhi ko hataane se zyada vot aaenge yaa unhen banaae rakhane se
 Both leaders also agree that to defeat the BJP they have to put forward their best policy
 is baat par sahmati banati dikh rahi he ki donon dalon ke vilay ke baad banane vaali sarkaar main nitish kumaar mukhyamantri ke pad par waapas aa jaaen or lalu yadav kii beti misa bharti ko varisht mantri pad de diya jaae
 Party sources say that Lalu Yadav has advised Nitish to take the command of the state from Manjhi, though Nitish Kumar is cautious about the idea
 unhen lagata he ki is kadam par bijepi kaaphi ho-hallaa machayegi
 It may also be that the BJP accuses Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar of removing a Mahadalit to woo Manjhi
 kaha ja rahaa he ki nitish ne is bare main sankoch jataayaa he, haalanki unhone is vichaar ko puri tarah khaarij bhi nahin kiya he
 Manjhi, who has a political experience of 35 years, is sensing new winds
 ab dalit card ko aakraamakata se khelkar ve khud ko mahfuj rakhane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 a JD (U) leader says, "the removal of Manjhi is a matter of minutes
" yah nitish kumaar ke upar he ki kis din ve yah faisla lete hai, lekin maanjhi kaa ravaiya dikhaata he ki unhen hataane ke kram main lalu yadav or nitish kumaar ko kuch rajnatik keemat to chukaani hi hogi
 It is a situation of great unease
 maanjhi jitne lambey samay tak kursi par rahenge, nitish kumaar bihar kii satta main utane hi haashie par hote chale jaaenge
 But if Manjhi is removed, it will be equally difficult for the JD (U) to ensure that he is not seen as an anti-dalit
 ”bholaa paswan shastri or ram sundar das ke baad maanjhi bihar ke tisare dalit mukhyamantri hai or unki nigaah saaf taur par rajya kii 22 fisadi dalit aabaadi par he
 There are 22 Dalit castes in Bihar and all except the Paswan caste have been put in the category of Mahadalit
 paswan rajya kii aabaadi ke kareeb paanch fisadi hai or inhen lok janashakti party ke netaa ramvilas paswan kaa vafaadaar mana jaataa he
 Therefore, Manjhi is eyeing the remaining 17 per cent Dalits
 dalit afasaron ko ahm pad dene ke alaava maanjhi ne iees str tak ke 300 se zyada anusuchit jati / janajati ke adhikariyon kii ek baithak ko bhi sambodhit kiya he
 This was a very clever move because the government officials from which the community comes from, they also affect their attitudes in a big way
 kaha ja rahaa he ki maanjhi 250 se zyada anusuchit jati / janajati ke un karmchaariyon kii barkhaastagi or nilamban kii samiksha karne vaale hai jin par nitish kumaar ke kaarykaal main faisla liya gaya tha
 These include employees ranging from clerk to additional district magistrate level
 maanjhi maanate hai ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad jab rajya main siyaasi sailaab aayaa tha tab kii kathin paristhiti main unhone hi jedy(you) sarkaar kii naav paar lagaai thi
 Recently he said, "after all, only a manjhi can save a ship from sinking in the middle ocean
 ”maanjhi ne kai asantusht vidhayakon kii shikaayatein dur kar ke unhen bhi apane paale main kar liya he jo kaam nitish kumaar bhi nahin kar paae the
 The Chief Minister directed the Chief Secretary and DGP of the state to write a letter to all the District Magistrates and Superintendents of Police asking them to give due respect to the mlas when they reach their offices and stand to welcome them
 duusari ore, nitish kumaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan vidhayakon or vidhaan parishad ke sadasyon kii ek aam shikaayat thi ki naukarshahi ko khuli chhot de di gai he or jiladhikari or police adheekshak vidhayakon kii upeksha kar rahe hai
 Manjhi, on the contrary, has proved to be sufficiently inclusive in the case of mlas
 haalanki maanjhi ke saamne ek badi baadha or he
 The coming together of Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar, who have been wielding political swords against each other for the last 20 years, is a sign of a historic change in the political landscape of the state
 ye donon netaa nirvivaad rup se jepi andolan ke do aise chehre hai jo siyasat ke shikhar par pahunche hai
 Today, if the arrogant but intensely political-minded Lalu and the shrewd and eloquent Nitish Kumar are only joining hands to stop the bjp's storm and save their existence, then obviously the possibility of someone else coming into the leadership would be gone
 is
 aise main maanjhi ko aaj nahin to kal janaa hi hoga
 Nitish is already disappointed with the Manjhi who was chosen by Nitish Kumar to sit in his chair after the JD (U) 's debacle in the Lok Sabha elections
 unki yah niraashaa tab bilkul spasht dikhaai di jab patrakaron ne unase poocha ki kya ve maanate hai ki november tak maanjhi mukhyamantri bane rahenge? nitish kumaar ne iskaa jawaab ek sawaal se diya, “main koun hota hum (is par tippanee karne vaala)?”yah sawaal hi maanjhi kii kismat kaa sabase sateek jawaab he
