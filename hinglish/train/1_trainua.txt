aam logon ke bajet (kharch) ko banane yaa bigaadpee vaala bajet ab sansad ke baahar jiesti council main banataa he
 Actually, if anyone needs to be worried about the budget, it is the Parliament itself
 loktantr kii sarvocch sanstha ko is baat kii gahari phikrhoni chahie ki bharat kii aarthik-vittiya nitiyon ke nirdhaaran main uski bhoomika kis tarah simat rahi he ?america main sarkaar kaa thap hona abhi-abhi tala he
 The entire nation's breath hung in the balance as the Congress did not approve government spending
 loktantr ke donon sanskarnon (sansadeey or adhyakshiya) main sarkaar ke vittiya or aarthik kaamkaaj par janpratinidhiyon kii sarvocch sansthaaon (sansad-vidhansabhaon) ke niyantran ke niyam paryaapt spasht hai
 The control of parliament-legislatures on the financial behavior of the Government is based on two principles: One - no tax without representation and second - Government's wallet i
e
 control of public representatives over expenditure
 isliye bharat main sarkarein (centre va rajya) sansad kii manjuuri ke bina na koi tex laga sakati hai or na kharch kii chhot he
 The Budget (revenue and Expenditure) is taken from Parliament through the appropriation bill, Demands for Grants, Finance Bill, Consolidated Fund (consolidated Fund)
 bharat main sarkaar sansad kii manjuuri ke bina keval 500 karod ru
 And that too from the Contingency Fund, whose size in 2005 was Rs 50 crore
 se badhaakar 500 karod ru
 it was done
 pichley ek dashak main sarkaar ke kharch or rajasav kaa dhaancha badalane se sarkari vitt par sansad or vidhansabhaon kaa niyantran kam hota gaya he
 GST is the latest sample
 jiesti se pehle tak apratyaksh kar vitt vidheyak kaa hissaa hote the, sansad main bahes ke baad inamen badlaav ko manjuuri milti thi
 The entire process of tax on consumption is now out of the control of Parliament-legislatures
 jiesti kanoon ko manjuuri dene ke baad janata ke chune hue numaayindon ne indirect tex par niyantran ganvaa diya
 The GST Council is not a Parliament
 yahaan do darjan mantri milakar har maheene tex kii daren badal dete hai
 What is the logic of these changes? Who benefits from this? Why is the discussion in the GST Council not public? How much does the GST Council stand for representation to impose tax? What will be the role of Parliament and CAG in relation to GST? Parliament and legislatures should discuss these questions
 bharat main sarkaron kii kharch bahaduree bejod he
 Increased dependence on debt makes interest payments a new record every year
 karj par byaaj kii adaayagi bajet kharch kaa 18 fisadi he, jis par sansad kii manjuuri nahin (chajrd expendichar) lee jaati
 Grants from state governments, panchayati raj institutions and other agencies account for 28 per cent of the budget expenditure
 sieji kii pichhali kai report bataati rahi hai ki kareeb 20 fisadi anudaanon par sansad main matdaan nahin hota yani ki lagbhag 38 fisadi (byaaj or anudaan) kharch sansad ke niyantran se baahar he
 The merger of the Railway Budget into the General Budget (2017) did not do any good to the Railways, but Parliament's direct control over the Railway Budget was over
 rail kaa kharch or rajasav kisi duusare vibhaag kii tarah bajet kaa hissaa he
 In the last three years, on the financial decisions, money bill (lok Sabha only) has been used a lot to cut off Kanni from Rajya Sabha
 gambhir vittiya faislon main ab puri sansad bhi shaamil nahin hoti
 After liberalization, the role of Parliament should be increased for transparency in economic decisions but
 
 
 swadeshi ko lekar aasmaan sir par uthaane vaale kya kabhi poochna chahenge ki videshi nivesh ke udaarikaran ke faislon main sansad kii kya bhoomika he, in faislon ko sansad kabhi parakhti kyon nahin he
 International investment, trade and tax concession treaties do not even see the face of Parliament
 vishwa ke kai deshon main in par sansad kii manjuuri lee jaati he
 When this is the condition of the role of Parliament in economic decisions, what will be the position of legislatures? When the government does not need to ask the Parliament for spending more than one-third of the Union budget, and one-third of the revenue to be taxed or changed outside the Parliament, then they should worry which in the democracy Vows to be omnipotent

 For the third time, China has put a hindrance in trying to declare Masood Azhar as a global terrorist

 In this episode, on Monday, 50 to 60 number of CBI officers formed into separate teams and raided 16 locations in the areas of Durgapur, Asansol, Arambagh, besides the capital of West Bengal

 Rahul's election rallies will begin in Haryana

 However, on the one hand, it is rumored that Rahul cannot campaign as he has left for the foreign country last night
 bijepi netaa or haryana houseing board ke purv adhyaksh jawahar yadav ne twitor par daawa kiya tha ki chunaav se thik 10 din pehle rahul gandhi bangkok ke liye ravaanaa ho gaye hai
 According to the claim, Rahul Gandhi left for Bangkok on Saturday evening
 haalanki, bijepi ke is aarope par congress kii ore se koi aadhikarik pratikriya nahin ai he
 In the list of star campaigners, Rahul Gandhi has left the post of party president
 iske baavjood vah congress ke star prachaarak kii list main shaamil hai
 The party believes that it will be able to attract more and more voters and will be able to spread the ideology of Congress among the people
 congress uthaaegi ye muddis bich khabar he ki maharashtra or haryana main congress berogari or khasta aarthik sthiti kaa mudda uthaaegi
 Congress will not raise the issue of purchase of Rafale planes
 aarthik sankat kaa mudda uthaane ke saath hi congress modi sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhane ke liye purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko bhi chunaav abhiyaan main utaarne kaa man bana rahi he
 a party leader close to the Congress vice-president has said that Rahul Gandhi faced an undesirable target in the Lok Sabha elections
 kyonki upie-2 'acha product nahin tha' jisaki marketing matadaataaon ke saath kii ja sake
 Some people within the party are criticizing 'team Rahul'
 unka kahana he ki ye team ummiido par khari utarane main vifal rahi or isane congress kii chunavi sambhanaon ko dhoomil kiya, lekin party netaa ne kaha ki team rahul par kiye gaye hamale galat dharanaon or pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke netritv vaale upie-2 sarkaar ke doshapurn aankalan par aadhaarit the
 On the condition of anonymity, the leader said that the UPA-2 government got caught up in controversies one after another due to several reasons
 kuch varisht cabinet mantriyon ke bich bair or unki jaise ko taisa vaali tarj par kii gai karrwai saarvajanik hui

 Incidentally Pranab Mukherjee, who was then senior minister and had served as the chairman of the UPA subcommittee on small states, was not in Delhi when the decision was taken
 gandhi ke salaahkaaron par kuch netaaon ke hamale ko nakaarte hue is netaa ne kaha ki iskaa makasad pramukh padon se kuch logon ko badalanaa he, taaki pehle jo netaa kinare ho gaye the, ve nirnay lene vaale padon par aa saken
 He said that the way Anna Hazare and his supporters campaigned on the Lokpal issue, the matter got out of the government's hands
 baad main yoga guru ramdev ke mudde se thik se nahin nipta gaya
 Similarly, the Lokpal Bill which could have been introduced in 2011 remained hanging till December 2013
 unhone kaha ki ye kahana galat he ki rahul gandhi ne upie-2 kaa agenda banaaya
 If that were the case, he would not come abruptly during a press conference at the press club and would not tear the government's controversial ordinance on tainted mps and mlas

 bachche kai baar pichakaari main pani bharne ke liye tanks main jhukate hai or usee main gir jate hai
 Therefore, you should fill the children with water in the pitcher so that they do not have to go to the water tank themselves
 herbal rang kaa prayog karenaap bacchon ko ek duusare ko rang lagane se to nahin roak sakate, bazaar ke ragon main khatarnaak chemical hote hai, isliye hameshaa herbal rang kaa prayog karen
 By doing this, there will be no side effects on your children's skin and the colors will be easily missed
 bataa den, aap vibhinn phool or subjiyon ke madhyam se ghar par khud herbal rang bana sakate hai
 Use the atomizer carefully, the peeler is a very simple toy, but if water is thrown directly at someone's mouth, anything can happen
 aisa karne se hameshaa bachanaa chahie
 Explain to children not to do this
 agar aap bhi bachche ke saath holi khel rahe hai to iskaa dhyaan rakhen
 Do not throw water balloons
 Water balloons are very common on Holi, but due to this, many accidents occur every year
 pani bharte hi gubaare kaa vajan kaaphi bad jaataa he or jab ye kisi par phenkaa jaataa he to isse chot pahunch sakati he
 Never throw balloons at a person riding a bike as it can damage the control of the vehicle
 kisi bhi tarah munh main na jaae rangakai bacchon main har cheez munh main daalane kii buree aadat hoti he
 If a child puts the color of Holi in his mouth, then the risk of poisoning will increase significantly
 darasal holi ke rangon main khatarnaak chemical mili hote hai jo agar munh main chale jaaen to tabiyat kharaab hone main der nahin lagati
 Wear full-sleeved clothes: The enthusiasm with which children play Holi is necessary to wear full-sleeved clothes because by not doing so their skin gets directly exposed to the colors
 agar bacchon ko puri baaju ke kapade pahanaaenge, to unki skin par rangon kaa said effect kam hoga or wo aasaani se chhot bhi jaaenge
 Honor the decision of another
 It is true that on Holi we say 'bad na mano holi hai', but it does not mean that you should paint someone or force them to play Holi even in opposition to someone
 apane bacchon ko duusare logon ke nirnay kaa sammaan karnaa sikhaaen
 Apart from this, never use soil or eggs while playing Holi

 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath in dinon trend main hai
 The kind of saffron kurta he wears is in great demand in Lucknow shops
 yogi adityanath ke mureed sirf uttar pradesh hi nahin balki rajya kii seemaa paar bihar main bhi dekhne ko mil rahe hai
 a person influenced by Yogi Adityanath has adopted a very backward village for development and named it 'yogi Adityanath Village'
 khud ko samajasevi bataane vaale is shaks kaa daawa he ki gaanv waalon kii sahmati lekar gaanv kaa namakaran kiya gaya he
 However, some people also appeared to disagree on changing the traditional name of the village
 purniya ke kelaabari gaanv ke log suvidhaon ke abhaav main badahaali kaa jivan jeene ko abhishpt hai
 The village has a population of about 350 people
 aise main samajasevi rajeev kumaar shrivastav kaa daawa he ki unhone dinadayal upaadhyaay keantyoday mishnaur yogi adityanath ke logon ko swaavlambee banane ke liye uthaae gaye kadamon se prerit hokar is gaanv ko god lene kaa faisla kiya
 Rajiv Kumar Srivastava says that by keeping the name of the village as Adityanathgram, people here will be inspired by the personality and work of Yogi Ji
 gaanv ke hi ek yuvak shiv shankar kumaar ne mandir nirmaan ke liye apni jameen daan di he
 He says that the men here go to delhi-punjab for wages
 agar gaanv main hi vikaas hoga to wo yaheen ruk kar kaam karenge or khushhaali main bhagidaar banenge
 It has to be seen whether Kiyogi Adityanathka's name changes its fate by joining the village

 The difficulties of life in Purnia's 'fakartakiya' village were engraved in a very lively manner by the 'third Kasam'
 ye baat duusari he ki paanch dashak baad bhi purniya ke kai ilaake vikaas kii baat joh rahe he
 Now it will be interesting to see what magic happens there by changing the name of Kelabadi village to Yogi Adityanath village

 kai logon ke liye yah hairaani kaa vishay tha, jab smriti irani ko cabinet mantri banaaya gaya
 Ever since Narendra Modi became Prime Minister and BJP came to power, there have been many contradictions, but at this time Smriti Irani's education remains a debate on social media
 virodh karne vaale or paksh main kehane vaale donon hi apni baton main kutarkon kaa sahaara le rahe hai
 Is it enough to argue that some great people were not educated but did great things? And if they did great things, that is why even if you are not educated, it will work
 saare sakshartaa abhiyaan khatm kar dijie, is tark par
 Accordingly, you should not submit the affidavit related to your education anywhere, what is the need, even for taking admission in the college? But this is done because it acts like a filter
 hindustan kii shiksha paddati kii khami hi yahi he ki aap kisi ke bauddhik str ko, uski samaj ko, uski degree se, uske numberon se nahin aank sakate
 Let us see what difference Smriti Irani will be able to make in this system
 smriti irani ko janata ne kabhi saansad banane laayak nahin samajha, lekin pradhanmantri ne unhen puure bharat ke maanav sansaadhan mantri ke taur par chunaa he
 But i do not hear the voices of people citing the verdict of majority, of democracy anywhere
 yah mujhe mere mitra nitin kii kahi hui baat yaad dilaa rahaa he ki yah loktantr nahin, loktantrnuma system he, kyonki hamane manmohan singh ko nahin chunaa tha, unhen sonia gandhi ne chunaa tha
 We also did not choose Sonia Gandhi as the President of the Congress, which kept the government's decisions
 yahi silsilaa jari he, badali hui sarkaar main bhi
 Why is Smriti Irani being surrounded on the issue of education
 kya bharat kii raajnneeti main aise udhaaharan or nahin hai? kitne hi saansad hai, jinhe janata ne chunaa he, unki shiksha or yahaan tak kii tameez kaa str dekhe bina
 Is it because she is a woman? This may be because her background is that of a model, and that is why this stance has been taken to avoid the outright anti-women statement
 ateet main congress ke netaa sanjay nirupam ek chanelle dibet ke dauraan smriti irani kii prishthbhumi ko lekar chhichhli tippanee kar chuke hai
 BJP leader Subramanian Swamy has also been questioning Congress President Sonia Gandhi about her degree
 yahaan tak ki unki prishthbhumi or vah kya kaam karti thim, is masale ko bhi vakt-bevakt uchhaala jaataa rahaa he
 But is it the issue of people's arguments? If you search the data of Lok Sabha Elections 2004 on the website of ADR institution, you will find that Smriti Irani is a graduate
 unhone yahi halafanama diya he
 But according to the 2014 election affidavit, Smriti Irani is not a graduate
 bachaler of commers part-1 unhone padhaa he, jo koi degree nahin he or ise vahaan likhe jane kii bhi zarurat nahin thi
 Isn't this fake? Will you not see the policy election of a minister taking cognizance of this? ek samay tha, jab smriti irani dharne par baithi thim or modi ji kaa istipha maang rahi thim, lekin baad main party dabaav ke kaaran uth gayi
 Till then no decision of the court had come
 jitna footage chahie tha, vah le liya tha, lekin phir rajanithik bhavishya bachaae rakhane ke liye palati maar di thi
 In today's time it is called 'drama', then it was called 'dharna'
 rajanithik bhavishya ke liye, party ke dabaav main aane vaale mantri ke policy chunaav ko aap is baat kaa sangyaan lekar nahin dekhenge? The middle class has been raising the issue of why illiterate people, less educated people are running our country
 mujhe janata kii soch par ab zyaada bharosa rahaa nahin, kyonki agar modi ji sachin tendulkar ko mantri bana dete to unki shiksha ke bare main nahin poocha jaataa
 Which ministry is worth it or not is not even asked
 najariye ko achche or bure kii shrenee main mat bantie, kyonki nazariyaa sirf acha yaa bura nahin hota, yah kisi ke liye acha, or kisi ke liye bura hota he
 You must be watching this mumbai main ban rahe ek fli over kaa ek hissaa gir gaya he
 The accident took place in Shantinagar area of wadala in Mumbai

 Sunil Gavaskar told 'aaj Tak' that the Indian team should not forget the first T20 match
 is match se team ko siikhnaa chahie
 i think there was more dot ball in the first match
 is par dhyaan dene kii jarurat he
 While batting first, the dot ball was played more by the Indian team
 mere hisaab 120 gedon main 55 genden dot thim, jo thik nahin he
 i noticed that in the first match, the opening batsmen were not able to do anything special in 6 overs
 yaheen sthiti gendbaajon ke saath bhi rahi
 We need to focus on the initial 6 overs
 saath hi shuruaati overon main wicket nikaalane honge

 If Shikhar Dhawan or anyone makes 45 runs off 25 balls, then it will be done, but questions will be raised on scoring 45 runs in 40 balls in T20

 At the same time, Gavaskar said that he might get a chance on the West Indies tour when Sanju Samson got an opportunity
 agar agle do maichon main pant kuch nahin kar paae yaa shikhar flop rahe to sanju samson ko bataur wicketiper team main jagah mil sakati he

 We must develop # uttarpradesh # leadership of @narendramodi@amitshah@bjp4india It is being told that the name of Lok Sabha MP from Gorakhpur Yogi Adityanath was chosen when the RSS did not agree with Manoj Sinha's name
 aisi khabar thi ki piem modi or bijepi pramukh amit shah ne junior telecom mantri manoj sinha ke naam kaa samarthan kiya tha
 The question is not about eating gourd kofta in a new shining plate in a Dalit's house
 sawaal yah bhi nahin he ki kabhi rahul gandhi ne aise hi khaaya tha to pradhanmantri narendra modi ne paryaton kahkar mazaaq udaaya tha or aaj jab amit shah kisi atipichade girijabind ke ghar kha rahe hai to congress mazaaq uda rahi he
 The Congress should ask itself a question
 kya bijepi ke is hamale se rahul gandhi ne gaanv gharon main janaa rahanaa or khaanaa chhod diya he? bijepi ko khud se ek sawaal karnaa chahie ki vah rahul gandhi ke ek asafal idia kii nakal kyon karnaa chaahati he? lekin yah sawaal to tab poocha jayega jab yah sabit ho jaae ki dalit pichhadon ke ghar khaane kaa andelan kya rahul gandhi or amit shah ne shuru kiya he
 However, in the invitation letter sent to the media by the BJP, Girijabind has been described as Dalit while Bind is very backward
 banaras se hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ne bataaya ki bind or rajbhar kai saal se anusuchit jati main shaamil kiye jane kii maang kar rahe hai
 Binds are associated with fisheries and are carnivorous in catering
 patrika dot com ke dow ajay krishna chaturvedi ne jab pradesh adhyaksh maurya ji se poocha to unhone bhi sweekaar kiya ki girijabind dalit nahin he
 Our colleague Ajay Singh told that Girijabind was earlier in the Apna Dal
 phir samaajawaadee party se jude or ab bhaajapa se jude hai lekin bhaajapa ke netaa kehete hai ki ve party ke samarthak hai
 Cohabitation and inter-caste marriage is an established program of the Indian social movement
 bhartiya swatantraaa andolan main doctor ambedkar or samaaj sudhaarkon kaa prabhaav badhane laga to is tarah ke kaarykram hone lage
 Dr Ambedkar laid the foundation for the right to drinking water and the movement of temple entry
 baad main shuruaati samaajawaadee andolanon ne janeu todane se lekar singh sharma hataa kar kumaar rakhane kaa bhi daur dikhaa
 All these may have had some effect but there was no major rift in the caste structure
 kyonki khaane or naam badalane kaa rasta sabase aasaan tha
 Actually eating does not matter because it is eaten under a schedule
 daliton ke ghar khaanaa tab khaanaa mana jaae jab us gaanv ke log bina rahul gandhi or amit shah ke khaane lage
 Both of them along with some people went to a house in that village and ate
 kya gaanv ke logon ne unke ghar in sabake jane ke baad khaaya? unhen shaayad nahin maaloom ho ki unki party kaa chota netaa rose ye kaam karata he
 Some mps and mlas also do
 shaadi baraat main janaa padataa he or khaanaa padataa he
 The media should have asked the upper castes of Jogiyapur whether the process of mutual catering has started, do they not eat at all, would they like to eat Girijabind's house after Amit Shah's departure
 magar patrkaar or camera bade netaaon kii parikrama karke chalaa aayaa
 There is no mistake of big leaders in this
 gujarat ke ek dalit sarpanch ne kaha he ki panchayat main unke liye alag cap or glass he
 People of other caste do not drink in them
 amit shah gujarat main aisi chhooaachhut ke bare main bolte hon, mujhe vaaqai jaankaree nahin he lekin rahul gandhi or amit shah donon ko gujarat ke gaanvon main bhi janaa chahie or vahaan sabhi savarnon ko line se khadaa kar kahana chahie ki falaan dalit sarpanch apane ghar ke puraane glass se pani de rahe hai or aap sab pani pi lo or unhen khud bhi sabake saamne pani pi lenaa chahie
 Despite this, the issue of catering is not as big now
 log kahin bhi kha lete hai
 Watch these two games to enter the temple and eat food for the Dalit
 mandir main pujari daliton ke aane par roak lagaataa he to dalit mandir pravesh kar is parampara ko todate hai
 Like recently BJP MP Tarun Vijay took a risk
 daliton ne to kisi ko khilaane se manaa nahin kiya phir unke ghar main ye rasoi pravesh andolan kyon chal rahaa he? yah ghatiya sanskaar savarnon ne tay kiye the
 Therefore, Amit Shah and Rahul Gandhi should say that now the Savarnas are bringing Dalits in their daily plate (not a separate plate)
 magar ho rahaa ulta he
 What is the goal of harmony food? Just eating food or taking risks for social change
 jin logon ne apane gharon main chhooaachhut kii bandish lagaai he unke ghar samarasata bhojan hona chahie yaa jin par ye bandish lagi he unke ghar jaakar
 It is a simple matter
 apradhi agar bandish lagane vaala he to uske ghar jaakar ye parampara todani chahie
 Yes or no? mujhe hairaani hoti he ki chunavi saal main samaaj sudhaarak ban jane vaale netaa antarjaatiy vivaah kii vakaalat kyon nahin karte hai? kya ve aisa kar sakate hai? jati todane ko lekar rahul gandhi, amit shah or mayawati kii kya raay he? kya ve jati ko samaapt karne ke liye antarjaatiy vivaah kii saarvajanik vakaalat kar sakate hai? phir lav jihad kaa kya hoga? lav jihad to antarjaatiy vivaah ke kilaaf he
 This campaign of political parties is to establish practical synergy between castes on a few issues or to end this exploited social system
 isliye aise kaaryakramon kaa koi mahatv nahin he
 The comments badlaav thali main nahin raajnneeti main karne kii zarurat he
 The time has come for the Dalit to become the defense minister, finance minister and education minister
 mantrimandal ke agle vistaar main bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ko in padon par kisi dalit saansad ko bithaana chahie
 The Ministry of Social Welfare has been declared as the Ministry of Reserve for unannounced dalit mps
 ise badalanaa chahie
 Some non-dalit ministers became there
 rajasav adhikari rahe udit raaj jaise log udyog mantri yaa rajasav mantri kyon nahin ban sakate hai? ab to udit raaj ne dalit sangharsh kaa apana rasta chhod bhaajapa ke hindutv kaa rasta chun liya he phir bhi ve qaabil to he hin
 BJP MP Arjun Meghwal elected from Bikaner reserved seat has been an IAS officer
 philippinos vishvavidhyalay se emb kiya he
 Both these Dalit leaders speak English Hindi well
 inhen kyon nahin carmik mantralay saunpa jaataa he
 Why do such leaders always become social welfare ministers
 raajnneetik dalon ke aise pratibhavan dalit netaa apni taraf se daavedaari kyon nahin karte hai? Harmony and cohabitation should be seen in these places
 hamaare desh ke loktantr main abhi wo din nahin aayaa he ki koi raajnneetik dal kisi musalmaan yaa dalit ko general seat se khadaa kar de
 So everyone is looking for indicative questions, nobody wants to do revolution
 koi pichde main ati pichhadaa bana rahaa he, koi ati pichde main kuch ko dalit bana rahaa he to koi daliton main mahadalit
 The politics of vote demands new equations
 hameshaa saamaajik badlaav nahin laati he
 Power changes but society does not change
 vaise bhaajapa kii taraf se media ko bheje gaye aamantran patr main girijabind ko dalit bataaya gaya he jabaki bind ati pichde hai
 Our colleague Ajay Singh from Banaras told that Bind and Rajbhar have been demanding inclusion in the Scheduled Castes for many years
 bind matsay paalan se jude hote hai or khanpan main maansaahaari hote hai
 When Dr
 Ajay Krishna Chaturvedi of Patrika
com asked the state president Maurya ji, he also admitted that Girijabind is not a Dalit
 hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ne bataaya ki girijabind pehle apana dal main the
 Then joined Samajwadi Party and now with BJP but BJP leaders say they are supporters of the party
 sahabhojita or antarjaatiy vivaah bhartiya saamaajik andolan kaa sthapit kaarykram he
 In the Indian independence movement, the influence of Dr
 Ambedkar and social reformers started increasing, then such programs started happening
 pine ke pani kaa adhikaar or mandir pravesh ke andolan kii buniyaad doctor ambedkar ne hi daali
 Later, the early socialist movements also saw a phase of breaking up Janeu and removing Singh Sharma and keeping Kumar
 in sabakaa kuch to prabhaav rahaa hoga lekin jatigat dhaanche main inase koi bahut badi daraar nahin padi
 Because the way to eat and change the name was the easiest
 darasal khaane se koi fark nahin padataa kyonki ise ek kaarykram ke tahat khaaya jaataa he
 The food of Dalits should be considered food when the people of that village started eating without Rahul Gandhi and Amit Shah
 donon kuch logon ke saath baahar se us gaanv ke ek ghar main gaye or khaae
 Did the people of the village eat their house after all this? He may not know that the younger leader of his party does this job every day
 kuch saansad or vidhayak bhi karte hai
 One has to go to the wedding procession and have to eat
 media ko jogiyapur ke savarnon se poochna chahie tha ki kya aapasi khanpan kaa silsilaa shuru hua he, kya ve bilkul nahin khate, kya ve amit shah ke jane ko baad girijabind ke ghar khaanaa pasand karenge
 But the journalist and the camera walked around the big leaders
 isamen bade netaaon kii koi galati nahin he
 a Dalit sarpanch from Gujarat has said that there is a separate cup and glass for him in the panchayat
 duusari jati ke log unamem nahin pite
 Amit Shah speaking about such untouchability in Gujarat, i really have no idea but both Rahul Gandhi and Amit Shah should also go to the villages of Gujarat and all the upper castes should line up and say that such and such Dalit Sarpanch of their home Giving water from old glass and you should drink all the water and they themselves should also drink water in front of everyone
 iske baavjood ab khanpan kaa masalaa utana bada nahin he
 People eat anywhere
 mandir pravesh or dalit ke ghar khaanaa khaanaa in donon kaa khel dekhiye
 If the priest prohibits the arrival of Dalits in the temple, the Dalits enter the temple and break this tradition
 jaise haal hi main bhaajapa saansad tarun vijay ne jokhim uthaaya
 Dalits did not refuse to feed anyone, then why is this kitchen entry movement going on in their house? These poor rites were decided by the Savarnas
 lihaaza amit shah or rahul gandhi ko yah kahana chahie ki daliton ko lekar aa rahe hai ab savarna ji apni rozmarra kii thali main (alag vaali thali nahin) pilav rasiyaav khilaaiye
 But the opposite is happening
 samarasata bhojan kaa maqasad kya he? sirf khaanaa khaanaa yaa saamaajik badlaav ke liye jokhim uthaanaa
 Those who have banned untouchability in their homes should have homogeneous food or go to the homes of those who are banned
 simpal baat he
 If the criminal is going to ban, then this tradition should be broken by going to his house
 he ki nahin
 i wonder why leaders who become social reformers in an election year do not advocate inter-caste marriages? Can they do that? What is the opinion of Rahul Gandhi, Amit Shah and Mayawati on breaking caste? Can they publicly advocate interracial marriage to end caste? Then what will happen to love jihad? Love jihad is against inter-caste marriage
 raajnneetik dalon kaa yah abhiyaan jatiyon ke bich chand masalon par vyaavhaarik talmail bithaane ke liye he yaa is shoshit saamaajik vyavastha ko samaapt karne ke liye
 Therefore, such programs have no importance
 tippaniyan Change needs to be done in politics, not on the plate
 vakt aa gaya he ki dalit raksha mantri, vitt mantri or shiksha mantri bane
 In the next expansion of the cabinet, BJP President Amit Shah should seat any Dalit MP in these positions
 samaaj kalyaan mantralay ko ghoshit aghoshit rup se dalit saansadon ke liye reserve mantralay maan liya gaya he
 It should be changed
 vahaan koi gair dalit mantri bane
 Why can't people like Udit Raj, who are revenue officials, become the minister of industries or the revenue minister? Now Udit Raj has left his path of Dalit struggle and has chosen the path of Hindutva of BJP, yet he is still capable
 bikaner arakshit seat se chune gaye bhaajapa saansad arjuna meghavaal iees afasar rahe hai
 He has an MBA from Philippines University
 ye donon dalit netaa angreji hindi acha bolte hai
 Why are they not assigned to the Ministry of Personnel? aise netaa hameshaa samaaj kalyaan mantri hi kyon banate hai
 Why do not such talented Dalit leaders of political parties contest on their behalf? samarasata or sahabhojita in jagahon par dikhni chahie
 The day has not yet come in the democracy of our country that any political party should put a Muslim or Dalit from the General seat
 isliye har koi sankethik sawaalon kii talash main he, kranti koi nahin karnaa chahta
 Some are making the most backward in the backward, some in the backward, making some a Dalit, and some making the Dalits a great Dalit

 gujarat vidhansabha main samaajawaadee party pradesh ke paanch vidhansabha siton par chunaav ladegi jabaki baaki siton par vah congress kaa samarthan karegi
 SP President Akhilesh Yadav told reporters, "we will fight five seats in Gujarat, where our organization is strong
" baaki siton par sapa congress kaa samarthan karegi
 In the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, the SP and the Congress had formed an alliance
 yah poochne par ki kya vah swayan chunaav prachaar karenge, akhilesh ne kaha ki jahaan sapa ummidavaar ladenge, un siton par vah prachaar ke liye jaaenge
 Gujarat has 182 assembly seats
 philhal rajya main bijepi kii sarkaar he, or vahaan party kareeb teen dashak se satta main he
 Explain that the Election Commission had said that the counting of Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat assembly elections is to be held simultaneously on December 18
 ayog ne himachal pradesh ke chunaav kii taarikh 9 november ghoshit kar di thi, lekin gujarat vidhansabha chunaav kii taarikh ghoshit nahin kii thi
 While announcing the election schedule of Himachal Pradesh, Chief Election Commissioner AK Joti had said that the date of Gujarat elections will also be announced soon
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main deree par uthaae sawaalgujrat main chunaav tarikhon ke elaan main deree ko lekarcongress party supreme court pahunch gaihai
 The Congress party has raised questions in its petition as to why the Gujarat election notification was not issued
 saath hi VVPAT slip kii samaysima 8 second se badhaakar 15 second karne kii maang bhi kii he
 The Chief Ministers' movement is coming in new colors for their demand
 kejariwal ne apni maang ke liye sadak par raat guzari, kiran reddy ne dilli main dharna diya, ab baari nitish kumaar kii he jinhone nayab tareeke se apane aandolan kaa aagaaj kiya
 On Saturday night, Nitish Kumar shouted slogans for special state status, first with a plate, then with his colleagues and now on Sunday, he will also march on foot to sit on the Gandhi statue
 apni maangon ke liye kisi mukhyamantri ko thali peetate kisi ne shaayad hi dekha ho, lekin shanivaar shaam bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar apane saathiyon ke saath lagaataar 5 minute tak thali peetate rahe taaki unke thali kii gunj dilli tak sunai de sake
 In the run-up to the election, Delhi may not hear this echo, but the effort is to reach the plate of their voters
 thali petakar nitish ne kaha ki unki is thali kii gunj dilli tak jarur sunai degi or kendra sarkaar ko unke vishesh rajya ke darje kii maang ko sunanaa hoga
 After beating the plate, Nitish said that its purpose is that its echo goes to Delhi, if the plate is beaten from everywhere, its echo will be heard and its effect should be produced
 immergency ke dauraan jepi ke anuyaayiyon ne thali petakar indira ke khilaaf alakh jagaaya tha, so nitish usee hit formule ko ekbar phir apana rahe hai
 As such, the movement had cooled down on the demand for special state status
 lekin seemandhra ko mili darje ke baad nitish kumaar ko to jaise oxigen mil gaya
 Nitish Kumar raised the question, when Seemandhra can get it in 24 hours, then why not Bihar
 narebaaji ke baad nitish kumaar ne kendra par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said, 'when you can give in 24 hours, you can also give it to us in the next 24 hours
 seemandhra ko aapane 24 ghante main de diya, hame koi etraj nahin he par hamaari itani puraani maang he to ye anyaay aap nahin kar sakate
 You give it to someone in 24 hours, in spite of long struggle to keep our demand in a logical manner and you put it in cold storage
 'abtak vishesh rajya ke darje ko congress ke saath chunavi ganthbandhan se jodakar dekha ja rahaa tha
 Although ready to join hands with the Congress even after getting special state status till yesterday, Nitish Kumar made it clear that now the political alliances are closed, but the central government will have to listen to them on special state status
 nitish kumaar is mudde par ravivaar subah apane bangale se 4 kilometre paidal march kar gandhi maidan jaaenge jahaan shaam tak gandhi murti ke neeche dharne par baithenge taaki unki vishesh rajya ke darje kii maang par bihar me ek maahaul ban sake
 The BJP has registered a landslide victory in the Uttar Pradesh civic elections, but more than the victory of the BJP, it is a defeat of the Congress, as the BJP candidates have won in those areas which were the strongholds of the Congress
 nikaay chunaav main jeet ke baad se bijepi jashn main dubi he, jabaki congress main maayusi chai hui he
 Even more interesting is that there is a discussion of Congress defeat more than bjp's victory, because this time the Congress strongholds have collapsed in the body elections
 vahiin, bijepi daawa kar rahi he ki upi nagar nikaay chunaav main haar ke baad ab gujarat main bhi congress ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 However, this time will tell whether the Congress will be able to win its glory in Gujarat? In Amethi, Rahul Gandhi's parliamentary constituency, the Congress candidate in Amethi Nagar Panchayat, Chandra Devi has won
 inhone congress pratyaashee ko 1,035 maton se maat di he
 There is a chance as well as a custom
 isliye yogi adityanath rahul par kataaksh kar rahe hai, kyonki nikaay chunaav main bijepi ne har us ilaake main jeet kaa paracham laharaya he, jo congress kaa garh tha
 BJP candidate Mahesh Sonkar has won the post of President of Jais Municipality
 unhone congress pratyaashee haji ishrat hossain ko 632 maton se haraaya
 Apart from this, bjp's Babita Jaiswal won the Sultanpur municipal council
 lucky drow main bhi analki rahi congreshkahawat he ki jab samay saath na ho, to kismat bhi saath nahin detii he
 This was seen in a fierce battle between candidates of Congress and BJP on ward number 56 of Mathura
 yahaan donon pratyaashiyon ko baraabar mat mili
 It was decided by a lucky draw
 isamen congress analki rahi or jeet bijepi kii hui
 BJP is celebrating the victory, because after the assembly elections, the Congress sweep in the civic elections is clear and the BJP is considering this victory as the streak of Gujarat
 use lagata he ki aisi hi jeet gujarat main bhi milegi
 Starting from Ganesh Chaturthi every year, the 10-day Ganeshotsav started by Shri Bal Gangadhar Tilak more than 100 years ago
 is tyohaar ko maanane ke peeche kaa mukhya uddeshay angrejon ke khilaaf bharatiyon ko ekajute karnaa tha jo dhire-dhire puure raashtra main manaaya jane laga he
 According to the immersion story of the Ganesha idol, Shri Ved Vyas narrated Mahabharata Katha to Shri Ganesh from Ganesh Chaturthi for 10 consecutive days, which was written by Shri Ganesh ji literally
 10 din baad jab veda vyas ji ne ankhen kholi to paaya ki 10 din kii athak mehnat ke badaganesh ji kaa tapamanabahut bad gaya he
 Immediately Ved Vyas ji took Ganesh ji to a nearby lake and bathed it with cold water
 isliye ganesh sthapana kar chaturdashi ko unako sheethal kiya jaataa he
 It is also mentioned in the same story that the temperature of Shri Ganapati ji's body does not increase, so Ved Vyas ji applied a fragrant aromatic pot on his body
 yah lep sookhne par ganesh ji ke sharir main akadan aa gai
 Mati also started fountains
 tab unhen sheethal sarovar main le jaakar pani main utaara
 In the meantime, Ved Vyas ji offered favorite food to Shri Ganesha for 10 days, since then symbolically the installation and immersion of Shri Ganesh idol is done and it is also customary to offer them a tasty diet for 10 days
 duusari manyata ke anusaarmanyata he ki ganpati utsav ke dauraan log apni jis ichha kii purti karnaa chaahate hai, ve bhagwaan ganpati ke kaanon main kah dete hai
 For 10 days since the establishment of Ganesha, Lord Ganpati becomes so hot after listening to the wishes of the people that Chaturdashi is immersed in the flowing water and they are cooled
 ganpati bappa se jude morya naam ke peeche ganpati ji kaa mayureshwar swaroop mana jaataa he
 According to the ganesh-purana, the gods called Ganapati to avoid the tyranny of a demon named Sindhu
 sindhu kaa sanhaar karne ke liye ganesh ji ne mayur ko vaahan chunaa or chah bhujaaon kaa avatar dhaaran kiya
 Devotees worship this incarnation along with Ganapati Bappa Morya's Jayakare

 desh main notebandi ke aadesh ke baad pehali baar purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne modi sarkaar ko aade haathon liya
 Manmohan Singh said that the government has taken this step without any preparation, which has increased the problems of the common man
 singh ke mutabik is kadam ke doorgaami parinaam arthvyavastha par padana tay or aane vaale dinon main iske asar se desh kii aay main 2 fisadi tak ijapha darj hona tay he
 Let us know what the former Prime Minister said on demonetisation
 saath hi desh main notebandi se upje halaat par arthshaastri kii bhi daleel sunne ke baad aam aadmi kya puch rahaa he?1
 Modi's historical mistake? Manmohan Singh: Modi government did not agree on demonetization move citing terrorism and black money
 kaha ki notebandi kii prakriya lagu karne se badi afra-tafari paidaa hui
 The former Prime Minister termed the government's move as a historic mistake
 kaha ki is kadam se rashtriya aay main 2 fisadi kii giravat dekhne ko mil sakati he lihaaja pradhanmantri ko ek rachanaatmak masauda dene kii jarurat he
 Manmohan Singh claimed that we are going into the trough in the long interval
 export or aam aadmiis baat main koi do raay nahin he ki deshbhar main is faisle ke baad se afra-tafari kaa maahaul he
 Global rating agency Moody's claims that the demonetization decision will put pressure on GDP in the early days
 shuru ke kuch varshon main sarkaar kii kamai main giravat dekhne ko mil sakati he
 But Moody's has claimed that this move is possible in the long run by a large increase in government revenue
 kuch jaankaar yah bhi ummid jataa rahe hai ki sarkaar kii badi hui kamai kaa sidhaa asar desh main vikaas kaaryon main teji ke rup main dikhaai degi
 On the other hand, many economists estimate GDP
 5 fisadi se lekar 0
 The decline is down to 3 percent
 haalanki mudies ne notebandi ke asar se aisi giravat kii baat se inkaar kiya he
 2
 aam aadmi kii maut tay?manmohan singh: notebandi par desh main aaj do raay he
 The common man needed to take special care of the problems faced
 notebandi kaa kya asar padegaa yah koi nahin jaanata
 Waiting for Modi for 50 days is not a big deal, but how can the common man be told to wait for 50 days because more than 65 people have died in the first 15 days
 export or aam admiam aadmi kii sabase badi pareshaani he ki vah beete varshon main apni puri jamaapunji ko bank ke hawaale karata rahaa
 He was hoping that he could withdraw his money whenever he needed
 lekin hakeekat kah rahi he ki aaj sarkaar ke faisle ke baad aam aadmi bank main rakhe apane paise ko nikaal paane main asamarth he
 On the other hand, economists argue that this decision of demonetisation will be maintained till the Reserve Bank does not bring sufficient amount of new currency in communication
 is faisle kaa sidhaa asar parivaar ke kharch or chote kaarobaariyon par pad rahaa he
 Till now, he was completely dependent on cash and today the cash he had was made useless and it is taking time to reach the new cash
 desh main khapat puri tarah se cash par nirbhar he
 Hence, the work of digital payment to the common man and to reduce the dependence on cash will gradually move forward
 baharhaal global financial agenciyaan daawa kar rahi hai ki sarkaar ke is kadam se legal kamai karne vaali jansankhya ko sirf shuruaati mushkil kaa saamana karnaa padegaa or lambey antaraal main unhen iskaa phayda milegaa
 At the same time, the argument is that this step is bad news for the illegal earners
 pariwaron ke paas gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se arjeet kii hui sampatti dub sakati he
 But contrary to these claims, every common man who had guaranteed security for 500 and 1000 notes is feeling insecure
 ab bhale aspataalon main 65 kii jagah sirf 45 log hi karency kii dikkat ke chalate mar chuke hai, lekin yah 45 bhi vahi hai jinke paas 500 or 1000 kii karency main ilaaj karaane kaa paisa rakhaa tha
 3
 bainkon par vishwaas kii maut?manmohan singh: notebandi ke is faisle se logon kaa bhartiya rupee or bankig vyavastha par vishwaas hameshaa ke liye uth jayega
 Can the Prime Minister cite a single country where a man can deposit his money but cannot withdraw it
 export or aam aadminotebandi ke faisle ke baad pement ke digital madhyamon kii ai baadh se bainko ko bada phayda pahunchnaa tay he
 All these mediums work in the mediation of the bank
 vittiya jaankaron kaa daawa he ki notebandi ke baad se bainkon main diposit 1-2 fisadi bad jayega
 This increase will give banks an opportunity to reduce the interest rate, which is expected to increase their earnings
 vahiin kuch agenciyaan jaise standard and pier (es and pi) maanati hai ki is kadam se bainkon kaa enpie badhane kaa khatra bad gaya he
 But the question is to know the side of the man who till now kept his money in the bank so that he would be safe
 sarkaar ke is kadam ke baad uskaa sabase bada dar yahi he ki ab bainkon main uski kamai surakshit nahin he
 Today this decision has created a fear in the mind of the common man towards the bank
 desh main adhikansh tranjaction (86 fisadi) cash ke madhyam se hota tha or ab sarkaar cash ke bajaae cashles ko tarjeeh de rahi he
 Now the common man is forced to prepare himself according to the new rules
 bhale hi vah anpadh ho use ab us takniki ke bharose baithna hoga jisase vah abhitak achoota he

 kam hui rigerv bank kii garimamanmohan singh: is kadam se rigerv bank ne kadi aalochanaon kaa rasta khol diya he jo ki puri tarah se jaij he
 At the same time, new instructions for banks will be considered as intervention of the Prime Minister's Office and the question will also be raised on its role
 export or aam aadmiglobal financial sansthaaen maan rahi hai ki is kadam ke baad bainko ko apane puraanehome lone or car lonaki recovery main dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 This increased NPA will be the result of demonetisation
 is enpie ke liye rigerv bank ko hi jimmedaar tehraaya jayega
 However, this step of the Reserve Bank will prove to be better in the long run
 arthvyavastha main kam karency kaa sanchaar hoga
 Most transactions will be virtual and fake currency will be controlled
 isse kendriya bank kaa kaam aasaan ho jayega or desh main gharelu or videshi bainkon ko sanchalit karne main sahuuliyat hogi
 But what the Reserve Bank and the Government do for the common man
 uske liye sabase bada sawaal to yahi he ki uske apane bank kii praasangikta khatm ho chuki he or uski vittiya suraksha ke saath raajnneeti ho rahi he
 This mother is the one who does not have even a fraction of black money
 jab arthvyavastha main kaledhan kaa adhik sanchaar tha tab bhi vah pis rahaa tha or aaj jab is sanchaar ko khatm karne kii koshish kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he to pis vahi rahaa he
 On this step of the government, no economist of the country and the world is guaranteeing that black money will be eliminated from the country and new black money will not be able to take its place
 uskaa to bas ek hi sawaal he ki kya is kadam se desh main rakhaa sara kalaadhan baahar aa gaya or nahin to kyon use is musiibat se guzarana pad rahaa he? Rail passengers traveling to Kerala will now have to pay a higher fare on ticket purchase
 1 july se kerala aane-jane vaali or kerala main chalane vaali sabhi trainon ke asi tikaton par 1 fisadi kaa kerala flud ses liya jayega
 Similarly, 0 on goods to be carried in goods trains to and from Kerala

 The Railway Ministry has issued a circular in this regard
 rail mantralay ke circular ke mutabik, kerala ke liye asi ke tikaton main ek fisadi kaa kerala flud ses tikat cancil karaane kii sthiti main waapas nahin kiya jayega
 The Kerala Flood Cess (KFC) will be printed separately on the ticket
 railway ne keeffsi vasuulne ke tareeke ko bhi udhaaharan dekar samajhaayaa he
 According to the railway, if the basic value of a ticket is thousand rupees, then by applying 1% KFC on it, the amount becomes Rs 1010

 britain ko itihaas bhuulane kii beemaari he - aisa kahana he congress netaa shashi tharur kaa jinka sawaal he ki britain ke skulon main upniveshwaad (colonialism) se judaa itihaas kyon nahin padhaayaa jaataa
 Talking to the British channel, Channel 4, Shashi Tharoor said that when it comes to British imperialism, Britain gets amnesia and forgets how the British Empire has grown
 tharur ne kaha ki britain ke bacchon ko skulon main upniveshwaad ke bare main ek line bhi nahin padhai jaati
 They have no idea what kind of atrocities Britain has carried out in other areas
 congress netaa ne kaha ki yah baat kahin padhai nahin jaati ki britain ne audyogic kranti ko angrez samrajya dwaara kii gai lut khasot se khadaa kiya he
 Shashi Tharoor did not stop here, he also said that the students here hardly knew that in the 18th century the British came to the richest country in the world and after 200 years of plunder, they were pushed into the pit of poverty
 tippaniyan Shashi Tharoor, who came to talk on his new book 'inglorious Empire', asked anchor John if all these things should make a difference on the existing relationship between the two countries
 is par tharur ne kaha ki yah sab baaten vartmaan ke do baraabar deshon ke maujuuda rishton ke bare main nahin he
 But at the same time he also said that it is very important to know about history because 'if you do not know where you came from, how will you be able to understand and appreciate in which direction you are moving

 lekin saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki itihaas ke bare main jaananaa bahut jaruri he kyonki 'agar aapako nahin pataa ki aap kahaan se aae hai to aap kaise is baat ko samaj or kadra kar paaenge ki aap kis disha main aage bad rahe hai

 The single bench of the Delhi High Court has refused to hear a petition filed to stop the promo of Anupam Kher's film The Accidental Prime Minister, which was mired in controversies before its release
 hai court ne yachikakarta ko kaha ki aapkaa is maamle main locas nahin banataa he, lihaaja is maamle main aap yachika ko janhit yachika main tabdeel karke dabl bench ke saamne lagaae
 At the moment we cannot hear this petition nor will we stop the promo of the film
 court ne kaha ki agar purv pradhanmantri kii image karaab hone ko lekar yachika he to phir ye janhit yachika ke taur par hi sunwaayee ke yogya hogi
 Now the petitioner will have to apply PIL in this case
 yachikakarta ne kaha ki wo aaj hi is maamle main janhit yachika daakhil karenge
 Please tell that this film is releasing on January 11
 yachika main kaha gaya he kepradhanmantrica pad sanvaidhanik pad he or yahaan par purv pradhanmantri kii image ko kharaab karne ke liye dikhaae ja rahe promo par turant roak lagaai jaae
 Before this, the image of the country along with that of the Prime Minister will also be bad
 yachika main ye bhi kaha gaya he trailor main jo kuch dikhaaya ja rahaa he vah bhramit karne vaala he or sanjay baru kii kitaab se alag hatakar he
 This is completely wrong and bogus
 yachikakarta kaa daawa he ki sanjay baru ne khud yah sweekaar kiya he ki unka film ke saath kisi tarah kaa koi sambandh nahi he
 The petitioner has said that in order to make the promo disputed and flirtatious, all those things have been shown to be directly violative of the rules and no permission has been taken from CBFC for the same
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki trailor main naa sirf cinemetography act ke rule 38 kaa ulanghan kiya gaya he balki sonia gandhi, rahul gandhi, manmohan singh jo jivit paatr hai, unase bina ijaajat liye yah film banaai gai he
 The petitioner's lawyer Arun Maitri told Aaj Tak, now in the PIL, he will not only ask the court to stop the promo but also ban the film
 yachikakarta ne kaha ki janhit yachika menutyub, google,centre sarkaar or sibiefasi ko party bana rahe he
 The PIL can be heard by the Delhi High Court on Wednesday

 How railway officials make fourth class employees (trackmen) work in their homes
 jabaki ye saraasar niyamon ke khilaaf hai
 Major action has been taken by the Railways after the news was shown on India Today
 uttar railway ne trecomainon ko apane gharon main gharelu naukaron ke rup main rakhane ke aaropee adhikariyon ko nilambit kar diya he
 Northern Railway spokesperson Nitin Chaudhary said that such cases will not be tolerated at all
 railway board ne turant nirnay lete hue aaropee afasaron ko nilambit kar diya he
 He said that it was said on behalf of the Ministry of Railways that the railways keep taking cognizance of such matters on its own
 or doshiyon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai kii jaati he, kyonki ye sidhaa-sidhaa railway ke niyamon kaa ulanghan he
 Reacting to the India Today report, Ashwani Lohani, chairman of the Railway Board, said that the railway is fully committed to ensuring that its machinery is not misused
 gauratlab he ki india today channel par prasaarit khabar par sangyaan lete hue uttar railway ke mahaprabandhak vishvesh choube ne sambandhit adhikariyon ko tatkaal nilambit karne kaa nirdesh diya tha
 EXCLUSIVE: There is safety of the tracks, which they place on the house of 'sahabas'
 In fact, in the past, such incidents of railways have come up, which once again raised questions on safety
 odisha ke titlagarh stesan par 22 dibbon vaali ek paisanger train 7 april kii raat ko bina ingine 13 kilometre tak chalati gai
 The train was somehow stopped by placing large stones on the track
 jis vakt ye hua us par train par ek hajaar ke kareeb yatri savaar the
 The passengers of the ahmedabad-puri Express were in good luck and survived safely
 lekin mangal seth kaa bhagya aisa nahin tha jisaki ek hafte baad bihar ke lakhisarai jile main 10 meter patari kaa tukdaa hatiya-gorakhpur maury express ke coach main ghus jane se maut ho gai
 This track piece was placed on the side of the rail line

 Human lapses are often cited for such accidents
 lekinindia today kii special investegative timki jaanch se jo saamne aayaa he wo hairaan karne vaala he
 Investigation has revealed that feudal thinking is responsible for such accidents which have held the lower management system of the Railways
 kai rajyon main india today ke under cover reporters ne ek maheene tak jaanch kii
 The investigation found major flaws in the last level of safety of the railway system itself
 ye khami thi ki surakshakarmi jinhen trecoman kaha jaataa he, wo vahiin hi nahin paae gaye jahaan unka hona bahut jaruri mana jaataa he
 The trackman's main job is to monitor the track, safety and repair the worn out rail lines
 iske liye unke haathon main crobars, hathode, chimate or anya jaruri saamaan dikhnaa chahie
 But during the India Today investigation, several trackmen were seen carrying brooms, buckets, kitchen knives
 ye sab isliye ki wo apane ‘saahabon’ (varisht adhikari) ke sarkari awaason kii saaf-safai kar saken, kichan main khaanaa bana saken
 Investigations revealed that many of the top officials in the railway's regional zones are removing trackmen from the field and taking up work as personal servants in their homes

 It is clear from the pictures that have been captured in the first sleeping Vijay Kumar Singh camera that Vijay Kumar Singh had already kneeled in front of sleep, but his ministerial wife was seen with sleeping two or two hands
 susheel kumaar modi bolte rahe or renu kushvaha kabhi soti rahi, to kabhi jamhai leti rahi
 Renu Kushwaha was a minister in the Nitish government
 Renu Kushwaha was elected an MLA from Janata Dal United in 2010, after which he was made the Minister of Industry and Disaster Management in the Nitish Kumar government
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan renu kushvaha ke pati vijay kumaar singh ne bhaajapa kaa daaman tham liya tha, jisaki vajah se renu kushvaha ko bhi janata dal united chhodkar bhaajapa main shaamil hona padaa
 Renu Kushwaha has contested from Samastipur on a BJP ticket in the 2015 assembly elections
 vijay kumaar singh bhi 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav madhepura se bhaajapa ke tikat par lard chuke hai or haar chuke hai

 After the results, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said the reason for this was overconfidence
 haalanki ab unhen is karaari haar kii vajah se amit shah ko bhi rubaru karwaanaa hoga
 It is reported from sources that the BJP high command has invited Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to Delhi
 shanivaar shaam ko bijepi adhyaksh amit shah unase mulaakaat kar sakate hai
 In this meeting, the opposite results of Gorakhpur and Phulpur by-elections can also be discussed
 shanivaar shaam 5 baje amit shah or yogi adityanath ke bich yah baithak hogi
 Let us tell you that earlier, Yogi Adityanath had canceled many of his programs after the defeat
 upi siem ne guuruuvaar ko hone vaale apane sareraajnneetik kaarykramaradd kar die the
 According to the earlier schedule, Yogi Adityanath was to go to Gonda, where Yogi was to participate in the 4-day folk art festival

 Yogi was to unveil the statue of Nanaji Deshmukh in the program

 bijepi ummidavaar ko gorakhpur sansadeey seat se sirf nahin haar hi nahin mili balki jis gorakhnath math ke yogi adityanath mahant hai, us par bhi 2014 loksabhaa chunaav se kam vot mili hai
 BJP candidate Upendra Shukla received only 182 votes at the Gorakhnath Math booth (booth number 250)
 jabaki 2014 ke chunaav main yogi adityanath ko 233 vot mila tha
 However, Gorakhnath Math is the biggest center of the politics of Yogi and Gorakhpur for the last three decades
 vahiin haar par yogi adityanath ne kaha tha ki ham is (basapa-sapa) gathbandhan ko samajhane main fail rahe, jiskaa ek kaaran atiaatmavishvaas bhi he

 yogi ne kaha ki is faisle ko sweekaar karte hai
 The UP CM said that the SP-BSP came together at the last moment, the two parties came together because of the Rajya Sabha elections
 ham is gathbandhan ko samajhane main fail rahe, jiskaa ek kaaran atiaatmavishvaas bhi he
 He said, 'we will try our best to overcome our shortcomings, we will work on a better plan for the future

 Hridayesh Joshi was the first journalist to reach Kedarnath after the devastation on 16 and 17 June last year

 In the book, there is a description of the orgy of death and destruction on the mountain at that time
 misaal ke taur par is kitaab se yah pataa chalata he ki gaurikund main kis tarah ek manager ne sabhi tirthayatriyon ko kamare main band kar hotel main baahar se taala laga diya
 The pilgrims stranded in death were imprisoned in the hotel and Mandakini swept the entire seven-story hotel

 a senior IPS officer involved in disaster relief work told Hridayesh in this book, “we worked very slowly in such a bad environment
 
 
 nahin, sach to yah he ki kai jagah ham sust hi nahin, bahut bekaar kaam bhi kar rahe the
 Nobody knew what to do in this situation
 vinashlila 15 june ko shuru ho gai thi or ham 19 june tak haath par haath rakhkar baithe rahe

 Many of his people did not even know what his purpose was
 kai jagah ko 3-4 din deree se aae or jab pahunche, to unke paas rassi or laathiyon ke alaava kuch nahin tha
 Most of them seemed weak and malnourished and had no training in their work
 " According to official figures, around 4,000 people died in this disaster, but Hridayesh had said in his reports last year that hundreds of dead bodies are still on the high hills
 aisi kai tasviren or khulaase is kitaab main hai

 The title of Hridayesh's book, 'tum chupke rahe kedar' is inspired by the spirit of the people of Uttarakhand, which he felt in the heart of every human being in Garhwal
 har kisi ko lagata tha ki unhen roji-roti or jivan dene vaala unka bhagwaan kedaar itani badi aapadaa ke vakt kyon chup rahaa
 In his book, Hridayesh also talks about the destruction of the environment in Uttarakhand and the vandalism being done by the real state lobby
 is kitaab main paryaavaran ko lekar uttarakhand ke logon main hameshaa se rahi chetana kaa zikr he or sangharsh ke ek lambey itihaas kaa varnan bhi he
 This book also sparks a debate about journalism as to why the news of saving our water and the source of life, the Himalayas, called political and market news, did not make a suitable place in the media

 As captain, i have nothing to think about DRS

 If they say that they should appeal then i will
 ’viraat ne aage kaha, ‘dhoni kaa ek shabd hi kaaphi or sabase bharosemand hoga
 He will be in the best position to take this decision

 However, during the last Test series played on Indian soil under the captaincy of Virat, India tried DRS as an experiment and now it will be seen in odis for the first time

 jiesti se kaarobaari or graahakon main badha vishwaas: On Tuesday evening, i went to Patparganj assembly constituency to cover a public meeting of Aam Aadmi Party's CM candidate Arvind Kejriwal
 yahaan se pichhali baar aap ke bade netaa manish sisodiya ne chunaav jeeta tha or is baar bhi yahaan se chunaav maidan main he
 But Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia arrived late in this public meeting and after their arrival there was some chaos
 darasal ye avyavashtha thi bheed ke management kii jisaki vajah se dhakka-mukki ho rahi thi or mujhe lag rahaa tha ki kisi bhi pal tambu gir sakate hai or bhagdad bhi much sakati he
 But then i turned around and realized what is really happening
 
 
 kejariwal kii jansabha main pehali baar ye sthiti aa gai thi bheed ko kaabo karnaa mushkil tha
 Well somehow everything went well, but then i am writing all this to tell you what has come in my mind
 main vaise to aam aadmi party kii pehle bhi bahut si jansabhaayen cover kar chukaa hum, lekin is baar main disambar maheene se kejariwal kii jansabha cover kar rahaa hum
 Looking at any one public meeting or seeing the number of people present in it, i do not want to make any assumption and sit down with nothing, but after covering the propaganda of Kejriwal in two months, i am telling what i feel
 kejariwal kii jansabha main bheed naa sirf lagaataar barkaraar he, balki badhati hui dekhi ja rahi he
 Not only in the lower class area, but also in the middle and upper middle class areas, the numbers are looking good
 lekin jab jansabha dehaat or loar class ke ilaake main hoti he to sankhya bahut bad jaati he
 The special thing is that the crowd not only listens but also shouts slogans when Kejriwal speaks
 ek badi sankhya aise logon kii dikhti he, jo keval kejariwal ko dekhne aate hai, jisase kejariwal kii lokapriyata kii tasdik jamini str par hoti he
 Let me give an example
 beete shuukravaar 23 janvari kii baat he
 i was sent to cover the public meeting of Arvind Kejriwal in Bhati Mines area inside the Chhatarpur Assembly
 main tay vakt se kuch pehle pahunch gaya
 Seeing what i saw there, i needed to call the organizers and party people to ask whether the public meeting is really happening or will it happen? i got the answer that it will
 main soch main pad gaya
 In fact, the whole mud was mud, because there had been a lot of rain the day before that and when i saw the sky, it seemed that clouds could just rain anytime
 vahaan sabha ke liye intazaam ho hi nahin paae the or mujhe dar tha ki kahin meraa itnaa dur aana vyarth naa ho jaae, kyonki jab aae hai to kam se kuch dekhakar hi jaaen
 If you come like this and run like this, then the loss of time will hurt the heart a lot
 khayr phir maine sochaa ki thik he jo hona hoga ho jayega
 But at my sight, all arrangements were made there and at a time where it was difficult to have a meeting, the meeting also took place and look at the pictures and guess
 
 
 
 
 (vahaan itnaa keechad tha ki aaj ye likhte hue bhi vah keechad puri tarah se mere juuton se gaya nahin) But should we directly assume that the Aam Aadmi Party will win the election from these pictures or from the growing crowd in public meetings? mujhe yaad aata he ki loksabhaa chunaav ke samay main bhi kejariwal ko sunne bahut bheed aayaa karti thi, khaastaur se dilli kii sabhaaon main
 In the Lok Sabha elections, the party got more votes than the assembly elections but the party was second in all seats in Delhi as compared to BJP
 lekin phir vahiin loksabhaa chunaav ke samay piem modi kii raily main hone vaali bheed yaad aati he
 There was also a crowd, and for the first time after 30 years, one party won a majority on its own
 yani bheed kaa sidhaa matlab chunaav jeetna to nahin mana ja saktaa lekin haa maahaul kaa ek motaa andaaza zarur hota he
 Today in Delhi, everyone is saying that there is a fight between the BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party, but a few months ago everyone was saying that if elections are to be held tomorrow, BJP will take 50-60 seats in the 70-seat assembly Will come, it is clear that in the perception and in the public meeting, this trade is visible from the crowd that the Aam Aadmi Party is continuously moving forward
 yahi nahin jamini str hone vaale prachaar main bhi aam aadmi party abhi tak bijepi se aage dikh rahi he, jabaki chunaav ko ab ginati ke din baaki rah gaye hai
 This feeling is probably also with the BJP now, so in the next few days, the BJP is going to bring the entire cabinet in Delhi
 pradhanmantri chaar reliyaan karenge, 13 mantri alag-alag vidhansabhaayen dekhenge, 70 saansad alag-alag zimmaa sanbhaalenge, sangh se prachaarak aaenge or madhya pradesh se mantri aaenge
 Obviously, Kejriwal's very strong challenge is scaring the BJP
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha he ki desh kaa samvidhan badalane kii koi soch nahin saktaa
 He said that even thinking of changing the constitution would be like committing suicide
 loksabhaa main samvidhan par charchaa ke dauraan piem modi ne kaha ki yah desh anek shakhsiyaton or sarkaron kii badaulat aage badha he
 He said that no one can say that no government did anything
 'samvidhan main sabko baandhne kii takat'piem modi ne kaha ki desh ke samvidhan main ham sabko baandhne kii takat he
 He said that it is through the Constitution that the way for everyone's progress opens
 '26 november aitihaasik taarikh'26 november, 1949 kaa zikr karte hue piem modi ne kaha ki yah itihaas kii ek ahm taarikh he
 Modi said that the importance of the Constitution was placed in the House quite effectively
 unhone kaha ki saansadon ne ekamat se charchaa kaa samarthan kiya
 It must have been difficult to form a Constitution for a nation as diverse as India, says PM in LS
