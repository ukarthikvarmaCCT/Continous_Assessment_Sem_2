 Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) scheduled the launch of its Moon mission on July 15
 51 baje se 56
 Stopped 24 minutes ago
 isro kii taraf se bataaya gaya ki takneekee khami kii vajah se lonching ko roka ja rahaa he
 What would happen if this technical flaw was not known? What would happen if the Bahubali rocket flew with GSLV-MK3 Chandrayaan? Could the rocket fly in such a situation? How far would it be to fly? Let's know the answers to many such questions
 
 
 lonching taalane kaa kaaran tha helium likecryogenic stage or chandrayan-2 ke bich sthit hota he launch whical
 There is a command gas bottle in it
 iske andar helium licage kii vajah se mishan ko rokna padaa
 The pressure level of helium was not being formed in the bottle
 yah 330 point se ghatakar 300, phir 280 or ant main 160 tak pahunch gaya tha
 Hence the launch had to be stopped
 22 june ko ground test ke dauraan oxigen tanks main licage kii dikkat ai thi
 But he was reformed
 chaar din main nahin ho pai lonching, to 3 maheene ke liye tal jayega Chandrayaan-2agar khami par dhyaan na dete or rocket launch ho jaataa to aage kya hota1
 When the Chandrayaan-2 deviates from the Earth's fixed orbit, the GSLV-MK3 rocket cryogenic stage would stop at about 15 minutes 97 seconds
 yaheen par launch whical chandrayan-2 ko lekar cryogenic stage se alag hota
 Then its height is about 176
 38 kimi hoti
 The Chandrayaan-2 would have detached from the launch vehicle at an altitude of 182 km in the next 25 seconds
 lekin chandrayan-2 176 kimi se lekar 182 kimi kii oonchai ke bich prithvi kii kisi kaksha main bhatak jaataa
 It took a lot of hard work to get him to his scheduled class
 isamen chandrayan-2 kaa kaaphi eendhan khatm ho jaataa
 2
 chand kii trejectory bighad jatisamanya sthiti main chandrayan-2 ko prithvi ke chaaron taraf andakaar kaksha main paanch chakkar lagane the
 After wandering in the earth's orbit, he was brought back to the fixed orbit, even then he would have to take five rounds but in the midst of all this, the fixed path to the moon would have changed
 chandrayan-2 ko chand kii yatra ke liye sahi raste par laane ke liye kaaphi sangharsh karnaa padataa
 This would have increased the distance during the moon's journey
 chand abhi dur he
 
 
 This is the reason behind postponing the launch of Chandrayaan-2 at the last minute
 agar chand tak pahunch jaataa chandrayan-2, tab kya hotengar isro vaigyanik chandrayan-2 ko chand tak pahunchane main safal ho bhi jate to chandrayan-2 main itnaa eendhan nahin bachataa ki vah chand ke chaaron taraf tay paanch chakkar puraa kar paata
 If after completing the round, Vikram Lander and Pragyan Rover would have landed on the lunar surface, they would not have completed the mission by the scheduled time
 ye kaisaa inaam? Chandrayaan-2 se pehle sarkaar ne kaati ISRO vaigyanikon kii tankhwaah4
 After reaching the moon, Chandrayaan-2's lifeline would have reduced on the surface of the moon, Vikram Lander and Pragyan Rover would have landed on the moon's surface, but their lifeline would have been reduced
 sabase zyada dikkat aati orbitor main kam eendhan kii vajah se
 He could not travel to the moon for a year
 saath hi vikram lander or pragyan rover se praapt data ko prithvi tak pahunchane main dikkat aati
 When the pressure of helium kept decreasing, the cryogenic engine would explode, the helium being leaked, it kept the liquid oxygen and hydrogen present in the cryogenic engine cool after launch
 agar helium li ho jaataa to launch ke baad cryogenic ingine main maujuud liquid oxigen or hydrogen ko launch ke baad thanda nahin rakhaa ja saktaa tha
 In such a situation, the cryogenic engine would have heated and exploded
 is sthiti main do parasthitiyaan banati
 Chandrayaan-2 would have been overshooted by the impact of the first explosion
 yani tej gati se antariksh main chalaa jaataa
 In such a situation, ISRO is unable to contact him and loses control
 doosraa ye hota ki visphot kii chapet main aakar chandrayan-2 bhi khatm ho jaataa
 Biggest loss
 
 
 tut jaataa vaigyanikon kaa hausalaagar yah mishan sahi samay par nahin roka jaataa to chandrayan-2 ke orbitor, rover or lander ko viksit karne main isro vaigyanikon kii 11 saal kii mehnat bekaar chali jaati
 It would also include five years in which the day and night effort was wasted by scientists of the centers including the Space Application Center Ahmedabad, who made all the payloads of Chandrayaan-2
 saath hi saath 1000 karod rupye kaa nuksaan hota wo alag
 11 big occasions when ISRO surprised the world with its strength Xiaomi ne haal hi main bhartiya market main Redmi Note 7 or Redmi Note 7 Pro launch kiye hai
 As expected, the company has reduced the price of Redmi Note 6

 The price of Redmi Note 6 will now start from Rs 10,999
 is model main 4GB ram ke saath 64GB kii internal memory di gai he
 However, this discount is for limited time only
 company ne kaha he ki yah cell limited period ke liye he
 Under this offer, these smartphones can be purchased from Xiaomi's website and Amazon
 Redmi Note 6 ke do verients hai – 4GB ram ke saath 64GB memory or 6GB ram ke saath 64GB memory
 The base variant will now be available for Rs 10,999, while the 6GB RAM variant will be available for Rs 13,999
 ye cell 8 march ko khatm ho rahi he to aapako agar ye smartphone chahie to isse pehle hi khareednaa hoga
 Not only Redmi Note 6, but other products of Xiaomi Redmi Note 5, Redmi 6, Redmi Y2 and Mi TV are also getting cheap
 haalanki aap shaayad is baat ko lekar thode kanphyus hon ki Redmi Note 6 Pro khariden yaa phir Redmi Note 7
 There is a difference of processor between these two smartphones
 Redmi Note 6 Pro main Snapdragon 636 procesar diya gaya he, jabaki Note 7 main Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 procesar he
 However, in the base model of Note 7, you are given 3GB of RAM and only 32 GB of memory
 isliye agar aapako zyada memory or ram chahie to Redmi Note 6 Pro ko discount main aap le sakate hai

 bharat or zimbabwe ke bich aaj haraare main do tii20 maichon kii series shuru honi he
 Zimbabwe's record playing at home is quite poor
 bharat ke khilaaf to team ko abhi bhi apni pehali jeet kaa intazaar he
 Let's take a look at the five things that suggest that the wait for the first win against India may be longer for Zimbabwe
 1
 Till date India has won both T20 matches played against Zimbabwe at Harare ground
 12
 6
 2010 ko bharat ne zimbabwe ko 6 wicket se haraaya tha or 13

 bharat ke khilaaf usne do tii20 match khele hai or donon main hi use haar mili he haalanki zimbabwe kii team australia or westeindies jaisi tiimon ko tii20 main haraa chuki hai
 The comments 4
 Playing at home is often the strength of teams, but playing at home, Zimbabwe has played 10 T20 matches at home, winning only 1
 5
 Hamilton Masakadza has played every T20 in the team and played seven half-century innings for Zimbabwe
 vahiin bharat kii ore se maujuuda series main kai aise khilaadi hai, jinhone ipel main shandaar pradarshan kiya he or isiilie is formet kaa kaaphi anubhav he

 lekin varsh 2014 ke pehle hi din cricket kaa vah record tutaa he, jo pichley 17 saal se kaayam tha
 
 
 In 1996, 16-year-old Shahid Afridi scored a century against Pakistan in Sri Lanka, facing just 37 balls, which was the fastest century in all formats of international cricket
 
 
 ab 1 janvari, 2014 ko queenstown main newzealand ke kori anderson ne sirf 36 gendon main saikadaa thokkar antarrashtriya cricket kaa sabase tej shatak apane naam kar liya he
 
 
 Also know why Corey Anderson's century is the fastest century of all formats of international cricket despite being scored in one-day International cricket

 By the way, Vivian Richards was unbeaten on 110 off 58 balls in that innings
 
 
 tinti-20 ko bhale hi khel kaa sabase tej format mana jaataa ho, lekin tii-20 antarrashtriya cricket main ab tak sabase tej shatak 45 gendon main banaaya gaya he, jo dakshin africa ballebaaj richard levi ne 19 farvari, 2012 ko newzealand ke viruddh hamiltan main banaaya tha
 
 
 Richard Levy had faced a total of 51 balls in that innings, and was unbeaten on 117 runs
 
 
 haalanki agar antarrashtriya cricket se alag hatakar dekha jaae to yah shatak tisare sabase tej shatak ke rup main gina ja saktaa he, kyonki gharelu tii-20 toornamenton main west indies ke tufaani ballebaaj kris gail ne 23 april, 2013 ko bangalore main royal chalangers bangalore kii ore se khelte hue pune warirs india ke khilaaf kul 30 gendon main shatak thoka tha, or pari ke ant tak 66 gendon main 175 ran banaakar naabad rahe the

 There are so many examples in the world, when the cartons bought paintings worth crores of rupees, but when one of his admirers reached the office of the courier company to get a painting of almost 4 crores brought from abroad in Delhi, there were already policemen waiting for him
 
 jaanate hai kyon? kyonki is painting main maut chupa kar rakhi gai thi
 The person who bought the painting arrived in Delhi to receive a painting from England
 lekin jaise hi painting uske haath main aayi achaanak usne khud ko pulisavaalon se ghira paaya
 Actually it was not a minor painting
 balki isaki keemat thi puure chaar karod rupye
 Actually, smugglers of drugs in the world have devised many ways to throw dust in the eyes of the law and in the coming days, many new ways are going to come, but in this episode, the smugglers of security agencies are now the most The new and most shocking way is felt, the more dangerous it is in itself, the more strange it is
 cargo plane ke jariye bheji gai paintingaduniya ke sabase vyast hawaii addon main se ek yani england ke heathrow airport par ek cargo plane hindustan ke liye udaan bharti he
 a small but dangerous thing is hidden in this plane full of goods, which is also waiting for the police of Hindustan
 plane takreeban 9 ghante kaa safar tay kar hindustan kii sarajameen yani dilli ke indira gandhi international airport par pahunchaa
 Intelligence agencies were eyeing the flight but what they were looking for was not easy to achieve
 agle kuch ghanton wo cheez flite se nikaal kar ek courier company ke daftar main pahunchaa di jaati he, lekin isse pehle ki courier company ke log uski delivery aage kar pate, narcotics control beuro yani enasibi ke officer bich main aa jate hai
 After raiding, they recover that item and then capture the person who came to take delivery of it
 painting kaa cover tutaa to khul gai polaupar se dekhne par ye kuch or nahin, balki ek khaas kism kii flex pating lagati he
 One can only assume that it is a decorative item, but when NCB officers break the upper cover of the wooden border with this flex painting, the reality is revealed, which the police are looking for from London i have been eyeing the efflex painting till Delhi and this is dangerous drug cocaine
 cocaine kii is khep kii keemat international market main takreeban 4 karod rupye se bhi zyaada he
 The narcotics control bureau (NCB), chasing the drug traffickers on an intelligence report, also reached the consulate in which the drug was secretly sent from England and even the person who was to receive the consignment in India
 duusare lafzon main kahen, to ab tak kii karrwai main ye oparation bilkul apane nishane par baitha lag rahaa tha
 But the real success of this operation was decided only on how much and what drug consignment is recovered from the recovered consignment
 andaja lagaana bhi tha mushkilpainting main kaale rang kaa border itnaa majboot or khoobasarat he ki use dekh kar andaja lagaana bhi mushkil tha ki iske andar kuch chipaaya bhi ja saktaa he lekin jaise hi ek scru driver ore hathode kii madad se is panel ko todaa jaataa he, andar tepe main chipki ek safed rang kii wo khaas chiz dikhaai de jaati he
 a glimpse of this white thing makes the values of NCB officials double
 ummid ke mutabik har panel ke andar se safed powder kii khep baraamad hoti he
 This white powder is nothing but a consignment of super fine cocaine, which has been sent from Trinidad and Tobago to England
 aise saamaanon kii rahati he talashenasibi kii maane to ab tamaam international airports par aisi chizon kii jaanch padtaal behad sakhti se kii jaati he, drugs ke dhandhebaaj khud hi apane saath drug kii khep le jane ke bajaay use courier ke raste ek jagah se duusare jagah tak bhijwa dena hi zyaada mufeed samajhate hai kyonki aise main haathon-haath pakade jane kaa khatra bhi nahin hota he or maal ek jagah se duusari jagah tak aasaani se pahunch bhi jaataa he
 According to experts, businessmen are always on the lookout for cavities, in which hidden drugs are easily sent from one place to another

 Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anant Kumar says that the Congress party under the chairmanship of Rahul Gandhi has shown duplicity in Mosul and inside and outside the Parliament
 iraq ke mosul menmari gaye 39 bharatiyonke bare main rajyasabha main sushamaa swaraj ne dukhad hatyaon ke bare main baat rakhin, lekin congress party rahul gandhi ke ishaare par loksabhaa main gatirodh paidaa kiya gaya or unhone jamkar shor sharaaba kiya jis kaaran wo apni baat yahaan nahin rakh sakin
 He has shown his insensitivity about such a sensitive subject
 anant kumaar kaa kahana he ki agar kisi ko maafee maangani chahie to vah he congress, jisane is tarah kii samvedanheenata dikhaai
 He said that 39 of our citizens were there under severe circumstances
 mosulmen unki hifaazat or suraksha ko lekar puraa desh chintit tha
 We could not say anything until the country had concrete evidence before the government
 lekin congress apane lakshya se bhatak gai he
 Rahul Gandhi and Congress should apologize on this matter
 duusari ore, lingayat ko alpsankhyak kaa darja dene ke mudde par anant kumaar kaa kahana he ki congress ne karnataka sarkaar ne samaaj ko baantne kii koshish kii he
 In 2013, Manmohan Singh refused to give minority status to Lingayat as a separate religion
 tab us prastaav ko nakaar diya gaya, lekin aaj ke din siddharmaiya or rahul gandhi puri tarah se palat gaye
 He targeted the Congress and said that in order to bake their political bread, they are also doing politics of dividing the country and society among castes, but these people will not succeed
 unako ulta padegaa
 The Congress and Rahul Gandhi will have to bear the brunt of this election
 lingayat samaaj vishaal hindu samaaj kaa abhinn ang he
 Congress is trying to break Hindu society
 vot bank politics rahul gandhi ke ishaare par siddharmaiya kar rahe hai
 The Central Government has got the support of Farooq Abdullah, the former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, over the Indians killed in Mosul
 is par abdulla kaa kahana he ki maare gaye bharatiyon par sushamaa swaraj ne jo bayaan diya us par raajnneeti nahin honi chahie
 Abdullah says that Sushma Swaraj has said that she could not make a statement unless she has evidence
 aisa unhone thik kaha
 Farooq Abdullah says that we are sorry for the Indians killed but their families have to work for them
 jo hona tha ho gaya, isamen kisi par aarope lagaaein to uskaa phayda nahin hoga
 The country has to move forward
 desh ko aisi takaton ke khilaaf ladanaa he jisane yah ghinauni harakat kii he

 rajd ke hi kuch vidhayakon kaa kahana he ki istipha to dur tejasvi yadav chunaav main haar ke baad ab party kii puri bagdor apane haath main chaahate hai
 Their effort is that if Lalu Yadav is not the national president of the party, then at least the executive chairman should make him
 lekin nishchit rup se wo chaay party ke varisht netaa hon yaa vidhayak jis prakaar se tejasvi yadav party kii gatividhiyon or vidhansabha satr main anupasthit rahe hai uske baad vipaksh ke hamale ke saamne rajd ke netaa bhi nihathe dikhte hai
 Former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf did not appear before the anti-terrorism Court hearing the suspects involved in the 2007 murder of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
 iske baad unhen 23 april ko hone vaali agali sunwaayee main pesh hone ke liye saman bheja gaya he
 During a closed-door hearing at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, Judge Chaudhary Habib ur Rehman summoned all the accused, including Musharraf, for the next hearing
 musharraf ko adaalat ne do baar saman bheja he, lekin ve shanivaar kii sunwaayee main pesh nahin hue
 Earlier, the same court had declared Musharraf absconding and issued an arrest warrant against him for not cooperating with the investigators investigating the murder
 aropiyon ke khilaaf saman jari karne ke baad nyaayadhish ne maamle kii sunwaayee 23 april tak ke liye sthagit kar di
 Significantly, Benazir Bhutto was assassinated on 27 December 2007 in an election meeting
 duniya ke siyaasi manch par kai desh adaavat bhale hi nibhaaen lekin is dushmani ke bhi kuch usul hote hai
 Especially where the question is of human life
 lekin sena or jihadiyon kii jakad vaale pakistan par ye baat lagu nahin hoti
 This is the reason that without general evidence of Kulbhushan Jadhav, the army generals behind closed doors heard the death decree
 haalanki pradhanmantri modi ne videsh mantralay or grih mantralay ko nirdesh diya he ki pakistan kii is harakat kaa kadaa jawaab diya jaae
 The Ministry of External Affairs has also said that if Jadhav is hanged, India will consider it thoughtful killing
 lekin ye sawaal barkaraar he ki kya aisa koi rasta he jisase jadhav kii jaan batch sake?ek najar aise hi kuch vikalpon par:antarrashtriya adaalat main guhaar?sabhi antarrashtriya rivaayaton ko darkinar karte hue kulbhushan jadhav ko bhartiya duutavas adhikariyon se milane kii ijaajat nahin di gai
 However, in the last one year, India has requested Pakistan for this dozens of times
 pradhanmantri navaj sharif ke videshi maamalon ke salaahkaar sartaaj ajij ne pichley saal pakistani seenet ko bataaya tha ki jadhav ke khilaaf pukhta saboot nahin hai, isliye sarkaar is masale par dogier ko puraa nahin kar paa rahi he
 Not only this, Iran's ambassador to Pakistan has given 100% falsehood to the claim that Jadhav was a spy of RAW
 ye kuch aise nukte hai jinhen lekar bharat hegg kii antarrashtriya aparaadh adaalat main is masale ko le ja saktaa he
 But this will not match the Indian policy of keeping mutual relations with Pakistan away from international interference
 lihaaja is baat kii sambhaavna kam he
 Prisoner swap: Soviet Russia and the United States have been exchanging spies with no eye-catching eye at the peak of the Cold War
 bharat or pakistan bhi isi tarj par kaidiyon ko reeha karte rahe hai
 Through Track-to Diplomacy, Delhi and Islamabad can reach such a consensus
 lekin navaj sharif sarkaar agar is baat ke liye raji ho bhi jaae to pakistani sena use is baat kii ijaajat degi, aisa nahin lagata
 Support for lengthy legal process? According to Pakistani law, through court martial, convicted convicts can appeal for reconsideration of the verdict in the civil court
 unke paas aakhri vikalp raashtrapati ke paas guhaar lagane kaa hota he
 Kulbhushan Jadhav has this option open to him
 bharat bhi iske liye vakil muhaiyaa karvaa saktaa he
 Will international pressure work? The Pakistani military may not listen to its government, but pressure from Middle East countries such as the US and Saudi Arabia often works on Pak generals
 bharat ke sambandh in deshon ke saath majboot hai
 The government also has an option to force the Pakistani army to reverse this decision through these governments

 Prashant Bhushan said that why Reliance was chosen for this deal? He did not even have land, Reliance was part of the formula
 17 din ke andar hi reliance ko jameen, dephence manufeccharing kaa license diya gaya
 He said that the agreement between the two governments happens in the event of an emergency, but there is no such situation right now

 However later the relationship probably ended at a bad turn
 em je akbar ne kaha ki jo log mere saath kaam kar chuke hai or mujhe jaanate hai wo is baat kii tasdik kar sakate hai
 Those people can also tell whether there was any pressure on Pallavi when she worked with me

 Pallavi said that instead of complaining to the police, i was feeling more irritated
 maine is bare main kisi ko bhi nahin bataaya, kya koi meri baat par bharosa karata? maine khud ko hi doshi maan liya, main hotel ke kamare main gai hi kyon thi?isse pehle saal 1994 kii ek anya ghatana kaa zikr karte hue pallavi ne kaha, 'main unke offis gai thi or kamare kaa darwaja band tha

 Therefore, they are not just illegal migrants, but they should be protected according to many international treaties signed by the Government of India
 unke waapas bhejne par roak lagaai jaani chahie

 Rajendra Shahu of Jalgaon, Maharashtra, went on a pilgrimage with great enthusiasm, but all his enthusiasm came to Uttarakhand
 darasal, rajya main in dinon sadakon par jagah-jagah bhayanak jam lag rahaa he or buniyadi suvidhaon kii baari kami ho gai he
 Rajendra says, "here neither the jam left us, nor the long lines in the temples
 '' madhya pradesh ke indore se uttarakhand aae praveen kaa chaar dham yatra kaa anubhav aisa hi rahaa
 Bhannai, Rajendra and Praveen left their mid-day tour to Mussoorie, Nainital and Haridwar
 uttarakhand hi nahin, himachal pradesh main bhi kamobesh aise hi halaat hai
 In the pilgrimage and tourism season, whether Haridwar or Nainital, or Chardham Yatra, every route jam in Uttarakhand is relieved
 kai sthanon par sailaaniyon kii baari bheed kii vajah se swasthya chikitsa, peyajal, parivahan, awaas or shauchalay jaisi buniyadi vyavasthaaen charmara gai hai
 The tourists are suffering from this
 is baar umad rahi bheed se joshimath or uttarkashi main dijal-petrol kii aapurti ladkadaa gai
 About 10-10,000 pilgrims are reaching Yamunotri and Gangotri Dham daily
 chardhaam yatra ke do pramukh dham ke uttarkashi jile main maujuud hone ke kaaran yatri vaahanon kaa sarvaadhik tehraav uttarkashi main hi he
 At nine petrol pumps in and around Rudraprayag, a main city of Badrinath Marg, on an average, 10,000 liters of petrol and 30,000 liters of diesel are consumed on normal days, but these days the demand for petrol has reached 30,000 and diesel demand of 80,000 liters
 
 vahiin, joshimath main yatra maarg par adhiktar bainkon ke atm main yatriyon ko dhanrashi uplabdh nahin ho paa rahi he
 There are 69 atms in the district Chamoli, which has about five crore rupees per day

 The problem of parking in the state has also become huge
 yahi nahin, paryatakon kii bheed umadaye se hotel sanchaalkon ne bhi kamaron ke kiraye main manamaani badhotaree kerani shuru kar di
 In the first weekend of June, tourists were forced to spend the night under the open sky, as the hotel, guest house, Dharamsala were packed in Mussoorie
 uttarakhand ke vibhinn dhaamon main is saal 12 june tak 18,56, 490 tirthayatri pahunch chuke the
 According to Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, more devotees and tourists have come to the state this year than anticipated
 sarkaar paryatakon kii badhati sankhya ko ek achche avasar ke taur par dekhati he, lekin iske anuroop infrastracchar tathaa anya paryaton suvidhaayen viksit karne kii jarurat he
 The Chief Secretary of Uttarakhand has instructed the District Magistrates to remove the deficiencies
 lekin jaahir he, sarkaar isko lekar bahut gambhir najar nahin aa rahi
 In Himachal Pradesh too, the crowd of tourists is growing so much that the roads to the tourist places are also reduced
 shimla, manali or dharmashala main na sirf rahane ke liye hotel kam pad gaye hai, balki yahaan aane vaale sailaaniyon kii gadibhan bamushkil apane gantavy kii ore bad paa rahi hai
 Barring the capital Shimla, the traffic problem in Kullu, Manali, Dharamshala and mcleodganj is disturbing not only the tourists but also the local residents
 gadipoon kaa boj chote shahar bhi sambhaal nahin paa rahe hai
 Shimla has more than three times the number of vehicles in may-june, whereas there is no parking space here
 sthaneey log sadak kinare gadibhan khadi karte hai or baahar ke vaahanon ke liye jagah nahin he
 There is also no alternative route in the city, so the entire pressure is on the circular road
 kalka se shimla tak forlan kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 Due to this, the sweat of the Solan Police is being released
 haalanki, shimla kii sthiti se nibatane ke liye upayukta shimla amit kashyap ne khud morcha sambhala he
 Keeping in view the tourist traffic, he has deployed 100 policemen to handle the traffic arrangements
 shoghi se shimla tak puraa din trephic rider petroling kar rahe hai
 The pickup entry has been closed from 8 am to 10 pm
 ve khud skulon kaa daura kar sthiti kaa muyna kar rahe hai
 Apart from this, Deputy Commissioner Shimla has also instructed that vehicles parked on the roadside should be challaned immediately
 jo intjaam shimla main hue hai, ve kullu, manali or maclodganj main nahin hai
 Tourists are upset there and trains are crawling for 3 to 4 hours
 rohtang main sthiti or bhi badtar he
 The NGT has banned construction at tourist sites like Shimla, Dharamshala and Manali
 isliye koi ab koi nae hotel nahin bana saktaa or aise main thaharne ke liye kamare bhi kam pad gaye hai
 At the same time, the helitaxi that was run, also proved to be a smokescreen
 helitaxi abhi kaam nahin kar rahi, isliye sara dabaav gadipoon or sadakon par he
 At the same time, many tons of garbage scattered in Shimla are revealing the functioning of the corporation
 kul milakar 50,000 kii aabaadi ke liye bana shimla 3,00,000 logon kaa boj nahin dho paa rahaa
 During the summer days, there was a water problem in Shimla last year
 haalanki, is baar mukhyamantri jairam thakur ne lagaam kasi he, lekin ve philhal europe ke daure par hai
 Due to their absence, some at the lower level are seen to be affected, as if they too are disturbed by the heat
 khaskar paryaton vibhaag kii ore se sailaaniyon ke liye koi vishesh prayaas nahin kiya gaya he
 Be it Barog or Peterhoff or Shimla; Private hoteliers are offering better services from these tourist places instead of the department
 jaahir he, ek ore jahaan garmi se raahat paane yaa phir tirthayatra ke liye log badi sankhya main in pahari rajyon kii ore rukh kar rahe hai, vahiin yahaan kii sarkaar unke liye samuchit vyavastha nahin kar pai he
 As a result, the situation in both the states has deteriorated and not only the outside tourists but also the local residents are distressed by this
 *** At the same time, in a letter sent to AIIMS director Randeep Guleria, the student alleged that the supervisor under whom he was registered in August 2013 is mentally harassing him

 maharashtra ke dipti siem or ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ke bhattije ajit pavaar ek or vivaad main funsate najar aa rahe hai
 He has been accused of threatening voters
 ajit pavaar kaa ek video saamne aayaa he jisamen unhen baraamati sansadeey kshetra main apni bahan supriya sule ke liye vot maangate dekha ja saktaa he
 During this time, he threatens the villagers that if they do not vote for Supriya, water supply will be stopped in the area
 yah khabar ek angreji akhbaar main chhapi he
 Aam Aadmi Party candidate Suresh Khopde of Baramati has filed a complaint in Vadgaon police station regarding this video
 haalanki, police ne abhi tak shikaayat darj nahin kii he
 The video is of the evening or night time
 jise kisi gaanv vaale ne mobile se record kiya he
 The face is not clear due to the darkness
 haalanki audio saaf he
 In this video, Ajit Pawar says, 'voting is going to happen tomorrow
 agar is gaanv se kisi ne badmaashi kii to main ilaake main pani kii supplai band karuunga
 Supriya is getting tremendous votes in Baramati, so your votes do not matter
 tumhaare vot ke kaaran na meri bahan jeetne vaali he or na hi haarane vaali

 bhartiya khaadya nigam ke charmarane kii khabaren aane lagi hai
 Through this, the Government of India purchases food grains from farmers
 sarkaar uske badale main nigam ko paise detii he jise ham sabsidi bill ke rup main jaanate hai
 Till 2016, Food Corporation of India used to get subsidy in surplus
 jitna chahie hota tha usase adhik
 But in 2016-17, when he needed one lakh 10 thousand crores, then he got 78000 crores
 baaki kaa 32,000 karod neshnal small sevings fund (NSSF) se karz liya
 Just as the Government of India has started taking money from the savings of the Reserve Bank, the corporation was already doing this work
 jaise-jaise zaroorat padi NSSF karz lene laga
 As a result, at the end of the financial year 2016-17, the loan taken from NSSF was 70,000 crores
 saal 2017-18 main bhi yahi hua
 The corporation wanted one lakh 17 thousand crores and the government gave 62,000 crores
 phir NSSF se 55000 karod lone liya gaya
 Thus by the end of 2017-18, one lakh 21 thousand crores have been loaned
 varsh 2018-19 ke ant tak yah badhkar ek lakh 91 hajaar karod ho gaya
 One unit of the Government of India has a debt of about two lakh crores
 iske alaava bhi nigam ne kai jagahon se lone liye hai
 Altogether two lakh and 40 thousand crores are loaned
 2019-20 se nigam ko mul raashi deni hogi
 This means that 46000 crore loan will have to be repaid
 is kaaran NSSF kaa kya haal hoga, kyonki vahaan bhi to janata kaa hi paisa he, iskaa vishleshan abhi padhane ko nahin mila he
 The major reason was stated that the government does not increase the prices of rice and wheat under subsidy
 chaaval teen rupaya prati kilo or gehun do rupaya prati kilo detii he
 If one rupee per kg is also increased, then the income of 5000 crores can be made in a year
 lekin jis scale kaa lone he uske saamne yah 5000 karod to kuch bhi nahin he
 Government 30 rupees on one kg of rice and 22 on wheat
 45 rupee kii sabsidi detii he
 During 2016 to 2018, the government was able to give more than half of the money announced in the budget for food subsidy
 jaahir he notebandi ke baar sarkaar kii aarthik sthiti charmarane lagi thi
 To hide this, the money declared in the budget was not given and the corporation would have been asked to repay it by taking loans from NSSF or elsewhere
 ab nigam par teen lakh karod se adhik kaa bakaayaa ho gaya he
 In which there is only loan of two lakh 40 thousand crores
 kya iskaa asar kisaanon par padegaa? jo sarkaar apane parfarmens kaa daawa karti he uski ek badi sanstha kaa yah haal he
 Soon the opposition will be blamed

 At the same time, Ajay Rai also wants to compete with Modi with the help of Muslim and Bhumihar votes

 As soon as Narendra Modi waved his 'hat-trick' victory in Gujarat, the demand for him to be projected as Prime Minister in the NDA increased, while the Congress has also started preparing for 2014
 congress ke kuch netaa rahul gandhi ko pradhanmantri ke taur par project karne kii pehle hi maang kar chuke hai
 If this happens then in 2014, Modi vs Rahul 'maha war' can be seen
 gujarat kii jeet ke baad modi kaa aatmavishvaas gajab kaa badha hua he, udhar congress ke khemen main khalabali ke baad ajeeb si khamoshi he
 By the way, the discussion of Modi's arrival in Delhi has been frequent from within the BJP, obviously this noise will increase further after this victory
 modi ke samarthakon kii ye gunj ho saktaa he dilli ke galiyaaron main sunai dene lage
 If the two biggest parties clash in the country in the 2014 general election, then it may be a contest between Narendra Modi vs Rahul Gandhi
 abhi gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main dono kaa aamanaa-saamana bhi ho chukaa he
 When Rahul Gandhi came for the Congress campaign in Gujarat, he said, 'it is the hard work of the people of Gujarat that Modi is taking credit for
 vikaas kii shuruyaat yahaan congress ne kii thi
 'modi then retaliated and said,' It will be good if Rahul Gandhi does his homework
 ' jaahir he agar 2014 main dono aamane-saamne hue to muqabla kaante kaa hoga
 It is different that Congress leaders also consider this comparison wrong
 salmaan khurshid is mudde par kah chuke hai, 'puraa desh jaanata he ki rahul gandhi koun hai, lekin modi ke bare main baat nahin kahi ja sakati
 'the thing to note is that these two leaders are preparing for 2014 in their own way
 modi ne gujarat main hetric maar kar apana loha manvaaya he, vahiin rahul gandhi tamaam koshishon ke baad bhi abhi tak khud ko sabit nahin kar sake hai
 In Gujarat, Modi has created his image as a man of development, Rahul Gandhi also talks about development in his own way
 narendra modi bade raajnneeti ranneetikaar he
 He does politics in a bold style
 party ke baahar hi nahin party ke bheetar bhi wo apane virodhiyon ko sir nahin uthaane dete
 Just before the Gujarat elections, he showed Sanjay Joshi the way out
 ye unki raajnneeti kaa ek tarika he
 He has designed his module of development
 baat wibrant gujarat kii ho yaa phir naino plant ko singoor se dilli laane kii baat ho, narendra modi maukey par chaukaa maarna jaanate hai
 The biggest thing is that they have their own support base
 vahiin rahul gandhi lagaataar apane sanghathan ke liye kaam kar rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi also works under a long strategy
 sarkaar main koi bhi bada pad lene ke badale wo sanghathan ko seenchne kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 He has organized the Congress organization to a great extent
 abhi party ke chunaav samiti kii jimmedaari un par he rahul gandhi lagaataar yatra karte hai
 Go between people
 wo bheed khinchne main maahir hai, lekin sawaal ye he ki unhe dekhne or sunne ke liye ikatthi hone vaali bheed vot main kitna tabdeel hoti he
 Before moving to the politics of the Center, Modi has many obstacles in his way from his party, yet it has not been decided whether the Congress will present Rahul Gandhi as PM in 2014, but if so If it happens, the competition will be very interesting
 desh ke sabase 'khantee' rajanetaaon main se ek hai sharad pavaar
 
 
 It is impossible to find his mind
 
 
 har taraf se congress ke liye aa rahi buree khabaron ke baavjood sharad pavaar congress ke saath bane hue hai
 
 
 Despite all the ups and downs, his Nationalist Congress Party, or NCP, has split the seats for the Lok Sabha elections 2014 with the Congress in Maharashtra
 
 
 lekin congress ke ranneetikaar ab bhi sharad pavaar ke saarvajanik bayanon ke matlab dhundte rahete hai, kyonki kabhi vah congress ke prati garam hote hai to kabhi naram pad jate hai
 
 
 Now in an interview to NDTV, Sharad Pawar has said that the Chief Minister of Gujarat and the Prime Ministerial candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Narendra Modi cannot be held responsible for the 2002 riots
 
 
 pavaar ne kaha ki jab adaalat ne kuch kaha he to hamen sweekaar karnaa chahie
 
 
 Why this issue is being raised again and again
 
 
 mahatvapurn baat yah he ki gujarat dangon par sharad pavaar kaa bayaan congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke pitiai ko die intervyuu ke baad aayaa he, jisamen rahul ne kaha tha ki esaiti (special investigeshan team) kii report par jaankaron dwaara kai sawaal uthaae gaye hai or nichali adaalat ke faisle par abhi badi adaalaton kii muhar lagani baaki he
 
 
 However, Pawar has also said that as Chief Minister, Modi has responsibility for the riots and he should take responsibility for it
 
 
 narendra modi or dangon ko lekar sharad pavaar isse milti-julati baat kuch samay pehle bhi kah chuke hai, lekin baad main party ke alpsankhyak morche kii baithak main unhone gujarat dangon ko lekar modi par tikhaa hamalaa kiya tha
 
 
 Whereas after the results of the four state assembly elections on December 8, 2013, Pawar questioned the functioning of the Congress high command
 
 
 tab pavaar ne aarope lagaaya tha ki gaiyrsarkari sanghathan haaavee hote ja rahe hai
 
 
 He was believed to have targeted the National Advisory Council led by Sonia Gandhi
 
 
 vaise is sabake baavjood pavaar yah spasht karte hai ki vah sanyukt janatantric gathbandhan (upie) ke saath hi rahenge
 
 
 Even before the election and after the election
 
 
 lekin raajnneetik galiyaaron main modi ke prati narmi baratane vaale pavaar ke bayanon ko lekar sawaal uth rahe hai
 
 
 It is being asked why Sharad Pawar is sometimes hot on Congress and Modi and sometimes soft
 
 
 jahaan tak pradhanmantri banane kii sharad pavaar kii mahatvakanksha kaa sawaal he, abhi tak unki ore se is par purnaviram nahin lagaaya gaya he
 
 
 However, Pawar says that his party does not have the strength, due to which he can become the Prime Minister
 
 
 yah zarur he ki pavaar is baar loksabhaa chunaav nahin ladenge or vah rajyasabha ke jariye sansad main pahunch gaye hai
 
 
 It is famous about the politicians of Maharashtra that they may be in any party, but there is strong friendship among themselves
 
 
 maharashtra bijepi ke kuch netaaon ke bare main halke andaaj main yahaan tak kaha jaataa he ki pradhanmantri pad ke liye unke ummidavaar narendra modi nahin, sharad pavaar hai
 
 
 It could also be a measure of Pawar's personality and his popularity among political opponents
 
 
 baharhaal, pavaar ke kabhi garam, kabhi naram rukh kaa raaj yahi lagata he ki bhavishya ke liye apane daravaaje sabake liye khule rakho
 
 
 If you are married then you must have seen your husband shaving and if you have not been married yet, you must have seen your brother or father shaving
 aamtaur par shaving ko sirf best shaving kriim or rager se hi jodakar dekha jaataa he
 But is it enough to use the best razor and shaving cream? You may say that after shaving it is necessary to use after shave, but it is not so
 sirf achche utpaadon kaa istemaal karnaa hi paryaapt nahin he
 Most of the men make some mistakes while shaving which have negative effect on the skin
 ye kuch aisi galtiyaan hoti hai jiskaa pataa bhi nahin chalata he par inkaa prabhaav saaf najar aata he
 1
 shaving ke dauraan thande pani kaa istemaal karnaa khatarnaak ho saktaa he
 Pores are closed when shaving with cold water, so that the shaving is not uniform
 aise main garm yaa gunagune pani kaa istemaal karnaa sahi rahegaa
 2
 shev karne kaa bhi ek sunishchit vakt hota he
 a better option is to shave the night before
 subah uthakar hadabadi main shev karnaa khatarnaak ho saktaa he
 Shaving before sleeping is a better option
 3
 Nowadays there are many such razors in the market which can be used more than once
 aise main rager ko ek se duusari baar istemaal karne se pehle use acchhee tarah dho len
 Make sure that there is no dust in it
 gande rager ke istemaal se sankraman hone kaa khatra bana rahata he
 4
 twachaa par bahut adhik dabaav daalkar shev karnaa sahi nahin he
 This may cut the hair inside, but it causes great damage to the skin
 isse tavchaa main jalan ho sakati he
 5
 shev karne ke baad after shev istemaal karnaa na bhoolen
 If there is no after shave, then you can use a moisturizer instead
 varanaa jalan ho sakati he
 The skin becomes dry after shaving
 aise main moishcharizer yaa after shev kaa istemaal karnaa bahut jaruri he

 At the same time, according to a vendor who failed the trial, the Army changed the Level 4 details of the United States National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and used a 'strange practice' in the trial process
