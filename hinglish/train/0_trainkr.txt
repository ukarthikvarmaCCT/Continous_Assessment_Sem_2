 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne vidhansabha main vishwaas mat hasil kar liya he
 The BJP-JDU government had 131 votes in favor and 108 votes in opposition
 vishwaas mat ke baad tejasvi yadav ne nitish kumaar par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 Tejashwi said that RJD and Congress voted against the trust vote
 2015 main bijepi ke khilaaf vot mila tha, mahagathbandhan ko vot mila tha
 Nitish has insulted Bihar
 agar bijepi ke saath hi janaa tha to chaar saal main chaar sarkarein kyon banaai he
 In four years, four governments were formed for one person
 hamanen rajyapal se milane kaa samay maanga tha, lekin hamen samay nahin diya gaya
 Even today we had a demand for secret ballot, but the speaker did not listen to us
 bijepi waalon ne sabhi vidhayakon ko bandi bana liya tha
 Tejashwi said that the 28-year-old youth did not bow down in front of anyone but even though he was a seasoned player, he bowed before the RSS-BJP
 unhone kaha ki nitish kumaar ne gandhi ke hatyaron or godse ke vanshajon ke saath haath mila liya he
 Tejashwi said that some time ago Nitish Kumar had recited a poem for PM Modi
 wo main aaj unako yaad dilaanaa chahta hum
 He was like a flowing wind, he had come from Gujarat, he was going to bring money, where did he go, he is worried about the country, he just seems to be traveling abroad, he is suffering from rising inflation, all the time he takes his selfie, he was going to bring Dawood, Finding where he went, former Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav said that i stand in opposition to this proposal
 hamen bijepi ke khilaaf vot mila tha, ye sab priplan tha
 This is a kind of murder of democracy
 bijepi ke bhi kai mantri hai jinpar aarope hai, nitish kumaar or susheel modi par bhi aarope hai
 Tejashwi said that Congress and RJD together saved Nitish Kumar's existence, Nitish betrayed the people of Bihar
 bihar main vigat 4 saal main 4 sarkarein bani he
 The reason for all is only one person

 Pic stays on principle twitter
 com / zz9lkvwvpd — Tejashwi Yadav (@yadavtejashwi) July 28, 2017 Tejashwi took the attack stating that Lalu ji is already accused and then why Nitish Kumar aligned
 nitish kumaar motihaari gaye, gandhi ji ke saamne baithe us samay inkaa asli cheharaa saamne nahin aayaa tha, aaj asli cheharaa saamne aa gaya
 Left with BJP, Nathuram went along with Godse's supporters
 ham akele kaaphi hai
 Nitish Kumar got scared, bowed down, ran away
 laluji ko putrmoh nahin chote bhai kaa moh tha
 If Laluji were selfish, we would be our CM as a big party
 ham siddhant va vichaar par adig havepiche

 com / vo4nylzwoh— Tejashwi Yadav (@yadavtejashwi)july 28, 2017unhone kaha ki ab janata nitish kumaar par vishwaas nahin karegi
 After turning from o Ram, Jai went to Shri Ram
 nitish kumaar par hatya kaa mukaadama chal rahaa he
 Sushil Modi is also facing a case of 104 then why i was targeted
 sabase badi party hone ke baad bhi rajyapal ne hamen mauka nahin diya
 The Governor comes to meet Nitish and then goes to the hospital
 unhone aage kaha nitish kumaar ko diene kaa gaali diya gaya phir kis munh se bijepi ke paas chale gaye
 We personally respect Nitish Kumar but politically Nitish Kumar has done wrong, sitting with BJP
 hamen dukh he
 It is wrong to go with the BJP by implicating an innocent, defaming the family
 nitish kumaar bol dete
 If you had asked for resignation, our party and i would have definitely thought about it
 agar lalu ji ko putrmoh rahata to lalu ji hamen mukhyamantri banaate lekin unhen bhai moh tha isiilie nitish ko mukhyamantri banaae
 Now Nitish Kumar will demand the resignation of all the chief ministers of BJP
 giriraaj ke ghar par karodon rupaye mili kya nitish kumaar unka istipha maangenge
 Will Nitish Kumar now oppose BJP on anti national issue in the country
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha he ki vishwa str par pratispardhi banane ke liye bharat ko ab karadhaan ke nichle str par jane kii jarurat he
 Jaitley's statement before the budget indicates that the government can give tax rebate to the people
 jetali kaha ki ab hamen nichle dar ke karadhaan kii jarurat he, taaki ham sevaaon ko adhik pratispardhi ban saken
 Competition is not domestic, but global

 The Finance Minister also said that with regard to tax evasion, now that phase is going when stealing tax from the government was not a serious matter
 jo tex banataa he usko adaa karnaa har naagarik kii jimmedaari he or aisa nahin karne vaale logon ko behad gambhir nattejey bhugatne pade hai
 He said that for the last 70 years we have lived in the belief that there is no harm in stealing tax from the government
 ise commercial smartnas ke taur dekha jaataa tha
 He said that the government is going to create such a system and structure so that people will be able to pay taxes themselves

 In reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech at a Mumbai event, Jaitley said that the media's interpretation of Modi's speech was not correct
 unhone spasht kiya, media ke ek halake ne us bhaashan kii galat vyakhya kii he or usne yah arth nikaalnaa shuru kiya ki isamen paroksh rup se pratibhutiyon ke kaarobaar main dirghakaalin puunjigat laabh par kar aropit kiye ja sakane kaa sanket he
 This interpretation is absolutely wrong
 unhone kaha, pradhanmantri ne pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup se aisa koi bayaan nahin diya, isliye main yah bilkul spasht karnaa chahta hum ki kisi ke liye is nishkarsh par pahunchane kaa koi aadhaar nahin he kyonki pradhanmantri ne aisa kuch nahin kaha he or naa hi sarkaar kii aisi koi manshaa he jaisaa ki media main kaha gaya he

 kashmir kya chahta he, kya is faisle main uski raay he? ladakh or jammu kii kya pratikriya he? pichley kai ghanton se kashmir kaise saans le rahaa he, kisi ko khabar nahin rahi
 No one knows what is the opinion of Kashmir now
 saare sampark or network niyantrit kar liye gaye hai
 Mehbooba Mufti has been arrested
 umr abdulla ko bhi giraftaar kiya gaya he
 Was first detained
 loksabhaa main neshnal conference ke teen saansad hai
 The PDP has two mps in the Rajya Sabha
 ye to algaavvaadi nahin the phir inaki raay kyon nahin lee gai
 It was said that PDP and National Conference are a matter of some families, they have their own interests in Article 370, due to 370 corruption has increased there, poverty has increased and terrorism has increased
 yah samasyaayein to duusare rajyon main bhi hai to kya vahaan bhi rajya kaa darja gata diya jaae or uske kai hisson ko kend shasit pradesh main badal diya jaae
 After all, why were the political parties not made part of this process? aktubar 1947 main jab pakistan kii sena ne kashmir par hamalaa kiya tha tab neshnal conference ke saikadon kaaryakarta muqabla karte hue maare gaye the
 Before reaching the Indian Army, the general population of Kashmir had faced Pakistan, had given their lives
 1947 ke vibhaajan ke bhayanak hinsa ke bich kashmir shant rahaa
 There were no riots there
 gandhi ne kaha tha ki kashmir kaa yah bhaichara bharat kii ummid he
 You will not be told that the terrorists killed hundreds of National Conference activists because they were with the Indian Constitution
 aapako yah nahin bataaya jayega ki aatankwaadiyon ne congress ke kaaryakartaaon ko bhi maaraa
 You will not be told that till a few days ago the BJP had a shared government with the PDP
 neshnal conference ko aatankwaadi nishaanaa banaate rahe
 Is there any kind of opinion taken from all of them, if you ask this question, then everyone will stand with the separatists
 dilli jammu or anya jagahon main rahane vaale kashmiri panditon kii pratikriya aa gai he or unke bich ise lekar kaaphi utsaah he
 The question remains of Kashmiri Pandits
 unke saath jo hua wo sari bahes ko niruttar kar detaa he
 That is why Kashmiri Pandits are seeing it as their victory today
 kya ab ve waapas jaaenge, yaa jane ke halaat honge, is kaa zikr bhaashan main nahin aayaa
 At least Amit Shah did not say anything about it in the House
 phir bhi kashmiri panditon ne is faisle kaa swaagat kiya or aitihaasik bataaya
 The media will not tell you that 6000 Kashmiri Pandits still live in the valley
 ve kis bhaichaare ke maahaul main rahete hai, unka anubhav kya he, ghati main kai hazaar sikh bhi rahete hai, kashmiri bolte hai
 Sikhs were also targeted by the terrorists in Chittisinghpur but we are not told how Sikh families live in the villages of the same terror affected Kashmir
 us bhaichaare kii kahani shaayad raajnneetik munaafe ke liye nahin he
 On their return, the stand of all the parties of the state is that they are welcome but the fact is not returned
 kashmiri panditon ke saath jo bhi hua wo ek gaharaa zakhm he
 Political rights have also been affected by this decision
 jammu kashmir or ladakh ke matadaata purna rajya ke liye matdaan karte the ab ve centre shasit pradesh ke liye matdaan karenge yani unki raajnneetik pahchaan aadhi rah gai he or adhikaar bhi aadha ho gaya he
 The army was deployed in Kashmir for a few days
 sampark samaapt kiye ja rahe the
 The Governor was making a statement that he does not know, what does not happen tomorrow
 satyapal malik kehete rahe ki 35-e hataane kii koi yojana nahin he
 Nor is there a plan to divide the state into three parts
 satyapal malik ne 12 june ko bhi kaha tha ki dhara 370 nahin hataaya ja rahaa he, do din pehle bhi unka indian express main bayaan chapa ki dhara 370 se chhedchhad nahin hogi
 Such a big decision was being made, the Governor neither knew it two days ago nor knew it two months ago and the President's order says that the Governor's approval has been taken
 ab satyapal malik kaa sanvaidhanik naitik bodh hi bataa saktaa he ki kya ve sahi bol rahe the
 Now here the lawyer Gautam Bhatia has raised the question
 is sawaal par gaur kiijie
 The Governor is the representative of the Center since when has he become the voice of the state
 isiilie hamane kaha ki is faisle kii prakriya kya he
 The bill passed in the Rajya Sabha with a two-thirds majority, but why did it happen that political parties were oblivious to everything from the governor
 yahaan tak ki sahyogi janata dal united ne bhi kaha ki unhen bhanak tak nahin thi
 Satyapal Malik belongs to the socialist camp
 usee dhara se janata dal united bhi he
 However, other socialists like Samajwadi Party have supported this decision
 amit shah ne baar baar kaha ki ham kashmir ko swarg banaaenge
 Be confident yah bhi sochna hoga ki dhara 370 ke rahane se kashmir ko kya mila, dhara 370 ke hat jane se kya mil jayega
 It is being said that employment opportunities will increase, but can anyone's political rights be reduced for this
 jaise kya upi ko centre shasit pradesh banaaya ja saktaa he ki vahaan rojgaar ke avasar badhenge
 There is also the fact that section 370 was hollowed out
 khud amit shah ne kaha he ki congress ne bhi 1952 or 1967 main congress ne dhara 370 ko amend kiya he
 The constitution expert Gautam Bhatia has said one thing here
 abhi tak dhara 370 kaa istamaal hota tha duusare praavdhaanon ko badalane main
 This is the first time that Article 370 has been used, only to remove 370
 amit shah kah rahe hai ki jammu kashmir main bhrashtachar tha
 This is correct too
 lekin kya is aadhaar par kisi rajya kaa darja kam kiya ja saktaa he, uskaa bantwaaraa kiya ja saktaa he
 This too is amazing
 arthvyavastha sankat main he
 Factories are closing
 rojgaar ja rahe hai lekin jammu kashmir or ladakh kaa darja badal diya gaya taaki vahaan rojgaar aae, factriyaan chalem
 The question about Ayushman is also in the rest of India
 sarkari aspataal kahaan hai, doctor kahaan hai
 The figures that Amit Shah is reading, not only Kashmir, can be said about other states, can their partition also be done in this way
 to ab jammu kashmir centre shasit pradesh main hindu musmalaan or sikh ko aarakshan milegaa
 Did not get before
 kashmir kaa itihaas behad jatil he or ye faisla bhi
 When then the governments were sacked and elections were held like that
 khud amit shah ne loksabhaa main iske pehle ke bhaashan main bataaya tha ki rajya ke chunaav main kis tarah kaa farjivada hota tha
 If someone else says this thing today, it should be called a traitor, but the Home Minister of the country had told what was happening in the name of elections in Kashmir
 yahi nahin ab kendriya rajya mantri jitendra singh ke bayaan ko bhi suniye jo unhone loksabhaa main kaha he
 They were telling the elected representatives of Kashmir to be the beneficiaries of 8-10 percent of the vote
 ab sawaal poochne kaa phayda bhi nahin ki kya baaki kashmir ne is faisle par hami bhari thi
 The government tried to explain in every way that the reorganization of the state of Jammu and Kashmir was very important
 bhale jashn man rahaa ho lekin samvidhan visheshgy kehete rahe ki dhara 370 nahin hataa he
 Two of its provisions have ended
 notebandi ke samay kaha gaya tha ki ghati main aatankwaad khatm ho jayega
 Not done
 ab kaha ja rahaa he ki aatankwaad kii jad main dhara 370 he
 Amit Shah not only removed Article 370 but also changed history
 unhone kaha ki yah galat kaha jaataa he ki sardaar patel pakistan ko kashmir de dena chaahate the
 It should not be kept in the record of the House
 unhone kaha ki kashmir ko nehru handle kar rahe the
 They said that the house should not be on record
 amit shah aaj itihaas bhi badalanaa chaahate the
 It is said about Sardar Patel that he wanted to give Kashmir to Pakistan
 aisa ho hi nahi saktaa he, ise record par laane kii zarurat hi nahin he
 History books have different claims than what Amit Shah claimed about Sardar Patel
 rajmohan gandhi ne sardaar patel kii jeevani main 439 main likhaa he ki sardaar patel ne 13 sitambar 1947 ko baldev singh ko patr likhaa ki agar kashmir agar pakistan main shaamil hota he to ve sweekaar kar lenge
 Patel's outlook later changed when it was revealed that Pakistan had accepted the merger of Junagadh
 26 june 2018 ko da print main shrinath raghavan kaa lekh he
 They write that the meeting of Section 370 started at Patel's residence on 15-16 May 1949
 uske baad patel ne nehru ko likhaa tha ki maine congress ko taiyaar kar liya he ki dhara 370 ko sweekaar kar len
 Nehru was not handling the issue of Kashmir alone, nor was Sardar Patel the issue of Hyderabad and Junagadh
 baar baar sawaal uthaa ki rajya kaa darja kyon kam kiya gaya
 The rule of the Center is going on there anyway
 sena maujuud he
 Amit Shah responded to this and said that when the situation is normal, he will return from the union territory to the state
 to ek asthaayee praavdhaan hataakar doosraa asthaayee praavdhaan le aayaa gaya
 There was no clear answer to how we can better fight terror in paying taxes from the state to the union territory
 shaayad zarurat bhi nahin he
 What is the definition of normalcy of the situation, it will be decided by the government
 amit shah ne yuvaaon se kaha he ki ve modi sarkaar par bharosa karen, 5 saal main parivartan aayega
 If they do nothing, is the Union Territory made for the next five years
 aath dalon ne virodh kiya he
 BSP, BJD and Aam Aadmi Party, YSR, AIDMK are supported
 congress, neshnal conference, pidipi, rajd, trinmul congress, janata dal united sahit aath dalon ne virodh kiya he
 This entire development should also be viewed from the international point of view
 kuch din pehle america ke raashtrapati kashmir kii samasya main bharat kii madhyasthata kii baat kar rahe the
 India immediately denied it
 aaj jo bharat ne kiya he usase america ko bhi messej gaya hoga
 But is this message the diplomacy of the message also about Afghanistan where India once had an edge and now America is giving importance to Pakistan
 ham ek baar phir se bataa den ki jammu-kashmir se judaa anuchhed 370 nahin hataaya gaya he
 Article 370 is part of Part 21 of the Constitution and cannot be removed without amending the Constitution
 samvidhan kaa bhaag 21 teen tarah ke praavdhaanon kii baat karata he
 Transitional i
e
 immediate, temporary, special provision
 jammu-kashmir se judaa anuchhed 370 samvidhan ke asthaayee praavdhaan main aata he
 There are three points under Article 370
 370 (1) kahata he ki jammu-kashmir sarkaar ke saath vichaar vimarsh se raashtrapati ke aadesh dwaara samvidhan ke vibhinn anuchhedon ko jammu-kashmir par lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 Whereas Articles 370 (2) and 370 (3) give many special rights to Jammu and Kashmir
 370(1) ke istemaal se jammu-kashmir ko kai vishesh adhikaar dene vaale praavdhaanon 370 (2) or 370 (3) ko hataa diya gaya he or desh ke samvidhan ke baaki praavdhaan jammu-kashmir par lagu kar diye gaye hai
 35A was also imposed under these provisions which was removed
 popular tivi game sho koun banegaa karodpati 11 main nayaa episod chal rahaa he

 From Pakistan's reality, rs-roshtish vermadiamond Books, Okhla Industrial Area, New Delhi-20 Price: Rs 150
 ek lambey arase se jammu-kashmir vivaad ko duniya bhar main keval kashmir ghati main chalane vaali ashaanti tak simit rakhkar dekha jaataa rahaa he, jo puure rajya ke bhugolic kshetra ke 9 fisadi se bhi kam ilaake ko prabhavit karti he
 Journalist Satish Verma's book brings out a lot of truth from the reality of Pakistan by taking it in a big scope
 arase tak jammu main tainaat rahe or rajya kii raajnneeti ko najadik se dekhne vaale verma do baar pakistan yatra kar chuke hai
 Based on the experience of these visits, Verma has captured the political situation of Lahore, Rawalpindi and Islamabad, as well as several major cities and areas in Pakistani-occupied Kashmir and Northern Areas that were part of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir before partition
 inamen mirpur, kotli, mujaffarabad, baltistan or gilgit bhi shaamil hai jinhen dekhne kaa bhartiya patrakaron ko virale hi mauka miltaa he
 By dividing the book with a total of 204 pages into 44 small chapters, he has presented a good analysis of the internal condition of Pakistan and many aspects of anti-india fever in the style of a news reporter
 pakistan main chalane vaale aatanki shiviron, kashmir andolan ke vibhinn roopon, pakistani patrakaron or netaaon kii maansikta, kashmir se aae visthapiton kii buree haalat, pioke or nodarn aria par pakistani upniveshvaadi pakad or uske khilaaf sthaneey janata kii naaraazgi, karakoram kii yatra tathaa pakistani janata main faili hataasha jaise kai tamaam vishay unke byore main shaamil hai
 One aspect of Verma's typical journalist style is that while opening the complicated politics of Pakistan in easy language, he also makes such comments that make the reader aware of many interesting aspects of Pakistan
 kuch udhaahranh ''jamhuriyat kii vakaalat karne vaale pakistan main pichley 62 varshon main vahaan ke awam ne lagbhag 48 varsh tak faujee hukumat ko jhela he
 The essence of our discussion of these meetings (in Mirpur) was that Pakistan would undoubtedly be making such claims in international forums that the people of 'azad Kashmir' wanted the merger of undivided Jammu and Kashmir into Pakistan, but The truth is quite the opposite
 darasal yahaan ke log pakistan se bhi nijaat chaahate hai
 While referring to his talks with the local leaders of Mirpur in Pakistan-controlled 'azad Kashmir' where there is independence, he writes in the chapter, "they allege that if there is an occupation of India in Kashmir, then Pakistan also has We have been forcibly captured
 kehane ke liye yahaan par chunaav hote hai, lekin rasm adaayagi bhar
 Rather, if we go to vote, then we have to sign a ballot which reads, 'we accept the merger of independent Jammu and Kashmir into Pakistan', which has been continuously opposed by most of the people here
 ''pustak kaa, badahaal visthapiton ke camp vaala adhyay bhartiya pathakon ke liye vishesh ruchi vaala he
 In it, the author has given a description of a refugee camp run by the Government of Pakistan in Muzaffarabad in which the Kashmiris who had fled from Jammu and Kashmir live in India
 pioke main aise 15 shiviron main bhartiya sena kii 'jyadatiyon' se tang aae hue yaa pakistan main 'aazaadee' kii chaah main aae lagbhag 35,000 kashmiri muhajir rahete hai
 The Pakistan government was told that every refugee received 750 Pakistani rupees every month
 (bhartiya 600 ru
 ) Gives
 camp kii fatehaal haalat par lekhak kii tippanee he, ''fouran hi hamaari samaj main aa gaya ki gilaani chowk par muhajir pariwaron ke bachche bheekh kyon maangate hai?''***pustak ansh (1): ek anjaani ummid ke sahare main sangam hotel (mujaffarabad), jahaan hamen tehraaya gaya tha, vahaan se nikalakar chaay kii talab se dukaan dhundhane niklaa or phir sthaneey mashhoor gilaani chowk tak nikal aayaa
 
 
 i was surprised to see that many children and girls were begging here
 ek saath itane bacchon ko bheekh maangate dekh mere man main utsukata hui ki aakhirkaar ye bachche koun ho sakate hai
 
 
 To a girl who is a little older and smarter in age
 jar aati thi, use apane paas bulaayaa
 She introduces herself as Salma, stating that she is the daughter of a Muhajir (refugee) family who migrated from Kashmir, a part of India
 chand minute ke sawaal-jawaab ke baad usne bataaya ki aazaadee or khushhaali kii ummid main unka parivaar sarhad paar kar yahaan chalaa aayaa tha or ab yah puraa parivaar mujaffarabad ke ek skool main bane muhajir camp main rahata he
 
 
 All the begging children belonged to some idiomatic family
 ***pustak ansh (2): meraa man ek baar to yah kahata tha ki nahin, abdul sattaar (ek muhajir sharnaarthi) jarur aayega, phir meraa dimag kahata tha ki yadi kisi ne mujhe abdul se baat karte dekh liya ho or vah khufia agency kaa aadmi ho to yah bhi ho saktaa tha ki abhi tak use giraftaar kar liya gaya hoga
 My luck was probably strong
 
 
 maine dur se hi dekha ki abdul sattaar ek anya vyakti ke saath hotel kii ore aa rahaa tha
 
 
 When (he) tried to enter the hotel, some people there wanted to stop him outside
 main samaj gaya ki ye agency (iesai) vaale hai
 My patience was answered
 mujhe daudkar hotel ke mukhya dwaar par janaa padaa
 i told him that this man had come to see me
 aakhirkaar kuch der kii kahasuni or bahes ke baad main abdul sattaar or uske saathi ko andar hotel laane main safal ho gaya
 
 
 Sattar and his accompanying partner told me that he was from Baramulla in Jammu and Kashmir, India
 aazaadee kii chaah main sarhad paar karke jab se vah yahaan aayaa he, tabhi se yah soch-sochakar pareshaan he ki aakhirkaar wo koun-si manas ghadi thi, jab usne yahaan aane kaa faisla liya tha
 *** The helplessness of most refugees is that they themselves do not understand what they should do
 Quoting an idiom from Baramulla, the author states that "many idiots are lodged in jails here on false charges
" ye ve muhajir hai jinhone iesai ke agenton or mukhabiron se virodh karne kii himmat jutai thi
 The easiest charge is of espionage, whichever one you want, stop it by accusing you of espionage
 ''is pustak kaa ek anya mahatvapurn or rochak hissaa naadarn aria main gilgit, balatistan or karakoram kii yatra he
 The author got an opportunity to interact with some local leaders who are deeply saddened by the Pakistani occupation despite the isi's control there
 1947 se pehle yah ilaaka bharat kii jammu-kashmir riyasat kaa hissaa tha
 Later, Pakistan captured it and imposed its administration there
 'baltistan neshnal movement' ke netaa shujaat ali khan ke saath apni baatcheet main lekhak ne paaya ki vahaan ke log pakistani niyantran kaa virodh karte hai or aaazaad baltistan ganraajya kii maang kar rahe hai
 The last chapter, once again in Lahore, the author has exposed the twopence of the Pakistani system
 aam pakistani naagarik ke liye lagu islamic mulyon par adhaarit kanoonon main pakistan main sharaab kii ekadam pabandi he
 But the last night in the name of the hospitality of Indian guests, the last of the mujra and alcoholism, presented another interesting aspect of the Bhadralok fraternity of Pakistan

 vidhansabha chunaav ke pehle madhya pradesh main farji voter list ko lekar bada bavaal machaa he
 The Election Commission is taking this work seriously after the Congress complained about 60 lakh fake voters

 According to the report of Hindi newspaper Dainik Bhaskar, the Election Commission had sent an investigation team in four assembly constituencies Narela, Bhojpur, Hoshangabad and Seoni Malwa
 maaloom ho ki is team kii report par congress ne aapatti jataate hue chunaav ayog se unki shikaayat kii door-tu-door jaanch karaane ke liye 13 june ko kaha tha
 2 lakh 37 thousand photos are being messed up, that the disturbance of the photos in the voter list is not already there but it has been going on since before 2012

 According to the same photojournal officers put before many names, photo-voter list was prepared about a decade ago
 us vakt matadaataaon ke photo uplabdh na hone ke kaaran bielo ne ek hi photo ko kai naamon ke saamne chaspa kar diya tha
 a similar case came to light in the Bhojpur assembly some time ago, in which a photo of a woman was placed in front of the names of 36 voters
 vahiin, silvani vidhansabha main bhi ek photo 12 se zyada naamon ke saamne laga tha
 Apart from this, 13 thousand voters have got the same name, whose addresses are recorded in different places in Govindpura, Narela and Berasia

 The special thing is that all this is in the desire to come in front of the camera
 kya thappad, kya danda, kya laat-ghusaa or kya gaali-galoch
 Just understand that every piece in this story is punished with slap, kick, lathi, punches and abuses and it is directly showing defamation of the law
 har harakat sidhe-sidhe chunauti de rahi he hamaare insaaf kii parampara ko
 This story of policeman crime repeats the same question again and again, which court of India gives the right to the police to punish someone like this publicly
 camere ke saamne aane kii chaahatadrasal, haal ke vakt main indore police kii aisi jitani bhi tasviren saamne ai hai unamem se zyaadaatar tasviren sirf ek local channel ke cameraman ne hi utaari hai
 The Indore police summons the cameraman and reporter of the local channel whenever it is in the mood to become 'singham'
 phir sara tamaasha unke camere ke hisaab se hi arange kiya jaataa he
 Now the latest and the latest pictures have come from the same camera, it has been called as the new campaign of Indore police started in Gunda campaign in Indore

 52 karodapashchimi railway ne ek artiai aavedan ke jawaab main bataaya he ki usne apane parisar main paste control (chuha maarane kii dawa) ke chhidkaav ke liye teen saal main 1,52,41,689 rupee kharch kiye
 The Western Railway is the smallest zone of the Indian Railways which mainly operates rails connecting North India to Western India
 railway ne is artiai ke jawaab main kaha he ki usne teen saal main 1,52,41,689 rupee kharch kiye or is kharch se 5,457 chuuhe maare gaye
 If the average is taken, then the Railways spent Rs 14,000 per day on spraying paste control in the yard and rail coaches
 is baari bharkam kharch ke baad pratidin sirf 5 chuuhe maare gaye
 However, Ravinder Bhakar, the chief public relations officer of Western Railway, said that it is unfair to draw such a conclusion
 unhone kaha, "kul kharch kii maare gaechuhonse tulana karnaa anuchit he
 This figure cannot be determined if we look at what we have achieved in total
 in sabhi phaaydon main se ek yah bhi he ki pichley do saalon main pehle ke mukaable chuhon ke taar kaat dene kii vajah se signal fail hone kii ghatnaon main kami ai he
 "the railway employs the services of specialist agencies to control the danger of pests and munching animals such as rats in coaches and yards
 ye agenciyaan railway rolling stock, stesan parisar or aasapaas ke yard main paste chhidkaav karke kiton or chuhon kii samasya par niyantran rakhti hai
 Various techniques are used to ensure effective control over the problem of pests and mice, such as bats, glue boards, some unfrozen chemicals and traps etc
 are used
 kitnashak chhidkaav ke uddeshy se prayek train ke liye ek shedul taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Before spraying pesticide, dry sweeping is first done in every coach of the train
 prabhaav badhaane ke liye tay samay par chemical badal diya jaataa he
 In the case of a pantry car, the entire coach on the platform is evacuated, cleaned thoroughly, smoked in the coach and then the pantry car is sealed for 48 hours
 yah sab nishchit samay ke antaraal par kiya jaataa he
 The railways feel that it has benefited a lot so far due to this control process of pests and mice
 railveka kahana he ki haal ke varshon main kiton or chuhon kii samasya kii vajah se aane vaali yatri shikayaton main lagaataar kami ai he
 Apart from this, it has also been successful in protecting property from damage, such as rolling stock, signaling installations, passengers' luggage etc
 railway ko yah safalataa paste control ke jariye mili he
 The railways also believe that due to the paste control spraying in place, rats and insects have not entered the premises, hence the exact number of mice killed near the railway is not available
 yatriyon ko ab jo aasaani ho rahi he, uski tulana karne ke liye railway ke paas maare gaye chuhon ke sahi aankade nahin hai

 uttar pradesh ke kanpur se kareeb ek hafte pehle agava kiye gaye bank manager ke iklaute bachche ko agava kar uski hatya kar di gai

 is kaam ko anjaam dene vaala or koi nahin balki bachche ke rishtedaar hi the
 The case is of Kanpur city
 jahaan dharmpal singh ek bank ke manager hai or apni patni or bete ke saath rahete hai
 On June 8, Dharmapal Singh Kabeta Ashutosh went to the tutoring house of a teacher in the locality with his sister Tanya at around 4
30 pm
 bahan use teacher ke ghar chhodkar aa gai thi
 After some time Ashutosh also left but he did not return home
 isse pehle ki ghar vaale uski talash karte dharmpal singh ke ghar par ek phone aayaa
 The callers described themselves as kidnappers, saying their son Ashutosh was in their possession
 badmaashon ne phone par hi uski jaan ke badale 25 lakh rupee kii maang kii or phone kaat diya
 The kidnappers did not even tell when and where to send the money
 iske baad 8 din tak police idhar udhar haath paanv maarthi rahi lekin bachche kaa kuch pataa nahin chalaa
 Eventually the records of the surrounding tower were extracted through phone call services
 tab jaakar pataa chalaa kii is puri sajeesh main or koi nahin balki bachche ke rishtedaar hi shaamil hai
 Actually, this conspiracy of kidnapping and murder was not hatched by anyone else but Ashutosh's wart's brother Prakash and his wife Raunak
 jisamen unka dene waalon main vishaal, shera or sandhya naam kii mahila bhi shaamil thi
 According to police, all have confessed their crime after being caught

 Priyanka said that BJP is an anti-women party and there are many such examples from Kathua to Unnao when this has been proved
 priyanka ke is bayaan par sho main maujuud bijepi pravaktaa sudhanshu trivedi ne kadi aapatti jataai
 Sudhanshu said that this is a contempt for Nirmala Sitharaman and Sushma Swaraj

 Speaker of Lok Sabha Sumitra Mahajan is also from MP
 sudhanshu ne kaha ki jin logon ne khud piem ko 10 saal sajaavati banaakar rakhaa unki maansikta aisi hi hogi
 Is it not a fact that today 50% women are in the Cabinet Committee on Security
 pehle aisa hua kya?sudhanshu ne kaha ki jab indira ji ko piem banaaya gaya tha tab ve goongi gudiya thim, baad main jaakar wo taqatvar baniin
 When Soniaji was made the President of the Congress, how strong was she? That coronation was also decorative
 congress kii yahi maansikta he jo baar-baar uske netaaon ke bayaan main bhi jhalkati he
 On Sudhanshu's objection, Priyanka said that my words are being misinterpreted
 maine kaha he ki sushamaa ji or nirmala ji sakasham or kaabil hai lekin unki kaabiliyat kaa istemaal nahin kiya ja rahaa kyonki unhen adhikaar hi nahin die gaye, unka mantralay koi or chalaa rahaa he

 During this, Maken has given a big statement saying that if the Delhi government does not reduce the rent in the coming few days, then the Congress will knock the court to take a stay on the increased rent
 mangalvaar ko ajay maakan ne bataaya ki kendra or dilli kii kejariwal sarkaar ke paas yah report pichley 15 maheenon se padi hui he, kyonki 8 sitambar 2016 ko yah report taiyaar ho gai thi or 26 navambar 2017 ko isko saarvajanik kiya gaya
 Maken said that Kejriwal started making noise after the increase in Metro fare, but did not respond to that when the Delhi government officer
 ke
 Sharma was a member of the fourth Fair Fixation Committee, so why did he never oppose the fare hike during the committee meetings
 maakan ne is dauraan power point pressentation dete hue bataaya ki july 2015 main mumbai metro kii fere phikseshan cameti ne 40 rupee ke adhiktam kiraye ko 110 rupee karne kaa tay kiya, lekin mumbai metro ne isame sirf 5 rupee kii badhotaree kii he or vahaan badha hua kiraaya 2 saal baad bhi lagu nahin hua, kyonki maharashtra sarkaar is samale par court kaa ste le ai
 Maken asked Arvind Kejriwal that when the Maharashtra government took a stay from the court to increase the Metro fare, then why did the Delhi government not go? Ajay Maken said that the Delhi government talks about giving 1500 crore to DMRC, while the subsidy of only Rs 755 crore for it and increasing the fare by 7% every year can only prevent the metro if it is in deficit
 ajay maakan ne saaf kiya he ki dilli sarkaar yadi agle hafte bade kiraye ko waapas nahin legi, to congress bade kiraye waapas lene ke liye court jaaegi or bade kiraye par ste laaegi

 On 28th day of hearing in Ayodhya Ram Janmabhoomi case in Supreme Court, the Muslim side said - the purpose of deliberately toppling the demolished mosque in 1992 'babri Masjid' is trying to erase the reality
 The hearing will continue till noon on the 28th day of hearing in the Ayodhya Ram Janmabhoomi case in the Supreme Court, on behalf of the Muslim side, Rajiv Dhawan said that the Hindu party is the victim of the gazetteer Zala is giving as per his convenience, but the Gazetteer was released from different perspective at many different times
 lihaaja sidhe taur par yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki babar ne mandir todakar masjid banaai
 It also said that the mosque was deliberately demolished in 1992
 muslim paksh kii ore se court main rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki babarnama main is baat kaa bhi zikr he ki babar ne kai duusari jagahon par mandir kaa bhi nirmaan karaayaa tha
 He does not agree with this view of Justice Agrawal, who is accepting many reports
 saath hi dhawan ne 3 shilalekhon kaa hawala dekar kaha ki inamen kaha gaya he ki babar ke commander mir baaki ne vahaan babari masjid banaai thi
 The Hindu side has raised objections to these inscriptions, but this is not correct as these inscriptions are mentioned in descriptions and gadgets of foreign travelers
 'HC ne maamuli aadhaaron par shilalekhon ko nakaara'rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki hindu paksh bhi jab yatriyon ke varnan or gajetir par baat karte hai to in chizon ko kaise nakaar sakate hai
 The High Court rejected these inscriptions on minor grounds, which is not correct
 hai court kaa kahana tha ki inamen antar he, lekin bahut maamuli he is aadhaar par ise khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Meanwhile, Zafaryab Jilani said that no claims prior to 1855 can be trusted

 Consciously demolished mosque Sunni's lawyer Rajiv Dhawan said that the objective of demolishing the Babri Masjid in 1992 was to erase reality
 iske baad court main daawey kiye ja rahe hai
 He said that it was clear with the intention of demolishing everything that it was done to justify the claim in court
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki 1985 main shoot daakhil kiya gaya
 Since 1989, VHP started moving around the country with Ramshila

 In fact, the Jharkhand High Court has directed the CBI to file an affidavit on the charges against Nitish Kumar and Shivanand Tiwari for taking money in the fodder scam case as to why the investigation should not take place against them
 chaara ghotaale main 30 sitambar kaa din kaaphi ahm he jab is par faisla aayega

 According to RJD, when Lalu Yadav can be made accused in the fodder scam without any concrete evidence, why not Nitish, while the same person has accused both of taking money in the fodder scam
 bihar vidhansabha main argedy ke mukhya sachetak kehete hai, 'saaf taur par ye court kaa maamla he lekin jis tarah kaa halafanama patna hycourt main us samay ke sibiai espi ne daakhil kiya tha usase to saaf he ki nitish kumaar hon yaa phir shivanand tiwari sabake khilaaf jaanch honi chahie
 We had done the same demand inside the Assembly and the Chief Minister said that you will give a neat cast to the people
 lekin sibiai ko ab saaf karnaa chahie ki unhone nitish kumaar ko clin chit kaise diya

 Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said this on Wednesday
 unki is tippanee se shivasena khush nahin he or yah donon dalon ke bich satta main saajheedaari ko lekar chal rahe matbhed ko darshata he
 Asked if Shiv Sena ministers would be included in his government before winning the confidence vote in the assembly on November 12, Fadnavis said, "first the faith then expand
" ' Fadnavis said that talks are going on at the 'appropriate level' for Shiv Sena's participation in the government and an announcement will be made in Delhi in this regard
 party sutron ne kaha ki kendriya mantri arun jetali or dharmendra pradhan shivasena ke vaartakaron se baatcheet kar rahe hai
 The Shiv Sena has expressed displeasure over Fadnavis' statement and a party MP has said that the BJP does not want to include him in the government with respect and until Saturday there is no 'respectable solution' about joining the government, the Shiv Sena opposition Will sit in unhone naam ujagar nahin karne kii shart par bataaya, 'fadanvis kii baat sunne ke baad hamamen yahi bhaavana majboot hui he ki ve (bhaajapa) sammaan ke saath hamen sarkaar main shaamil nahin karnaa chaahate
 But if they do not show a respectable solution by Saturday, then we will have to sit in the opposition
 ' Rahul Gandhi becoming the President of the Congress Party just before the Gujarat elections is both positive and challenging for him
 sakaaratmak isliye kyonki rahul kii badalati chhavi main gujarat chunaav ke dauraan kii unki sakriyata kaa bada yogadan he
 The preparations and attitude with which Rahul landed in Gujarat elections before becoming the president is unprecedented
 or unka aatmavishvaas badha hua saaf nazar aa rahaa he
 This new avatar also reinforces his new responsibility as Congress President
 lekin kuch chunautiyaan bhi hai
 And in view of these challenges, it is very important for Rahul to win in Gujarat or perform well
 darasal, adhyaksh ke rup main unke naam kii ghoshnaa ke ek saptaah baad hi gujarat or himachal ke vidhansabha chunaav parinaam aa rahe hai or in nateezon ke aadhaar par rahul ko yaa to vaahvahee mil rahi hogi or yaa phir unhen kuch tikhe sawaalon ke jawaab dene honge
 Let's take a look at some such important reasons - winning the losing game, we have critics of Harul say that only and only defeat has been lost in his political career
 wo jahaan bhi prachaar karne gaye, party harati rahi
 But due to his mother Sonia Gandhi holding the post of Congress president, the defeat of Rahul in the presence of the Congress party was also considered defeat
 ab, jabaki wo party adhyaksh ban gaye hai or ek bahari chehre ke bajaay gujarat main logon ke bich rache-based nazar aa rahe hai, is chunaav main congress kaa haarana sidhe taur par unki haar maani jaaegi
 Critics will say that even if you give the command, party and all rights to Rahul, he is destined to lose luck
 gujarat main jeet hi rahul kii is chhavi ko badal sakati he
 LIVE: Three Patrahaul of Gujarat's second phase voting coverage Dhaka is undoubtedly appearing in a new avatar
 unke bare main logon ke bich dharna tezi se badalati mahasoos ho rahi he
 Rahul's confidence seems to be better and his speaking, answering things, his appearance is also improving
 pehali baar rahul ek paripakv netaa kii tarah dikhaai de rahe hai
 Even the opposition cannot forget to consider them as mrigachauna
 lekin gujarat kii ek haar unpar haas-parihaas ke tikhe hamale phir se karne kaa mauka khol degi
 The improvement in Rahul's image needs a clear proof at the moment and it will be determined by the Gujarat election results
 nae senapati main yakinrahul ke liye gujarat jeetna isliye bhi zaruri he kyonki unki apni party main unhen gambhirtha se liya jaae, iske liye aavashyak he ki wo khud ko sabit kar paaen
 Even if Rahul is not able to cross the Congress' lead in Gujarat, on what basis will he promise to guarantee victory from his party's faces in other states
 aane vaale dinon main rajasthan, madhyapradesh jaise rajyon main chunaav honge
 New party leaders are emerging there too
 rahul unase jeet kii guarantee tabhi maang sakate hai jab wo khud aisa karke dikhaaen
 Fear of fratricide has a large number of leaders in the Congress party who will be gradually marginalized and less relevant in Rahul style politics
 aise main agar rahul gujarat haar jate hai to yahi netaa party ke andar asantosh ko hawa denge
 Slogans such as factionalism and Sonia Lao, Save Congress can also be given
 yahaan tak ki party main neeche ke str par kaaryakarta kaa hatotsahit hona sanghathan ko bachaane or phir se khadaa karne kii drushti se bahut baari pad saktaa he

 ayurveda ke saath bada hua hum main
 My father Vaidya Chandra Prakash used to run his own dispensary and with the active support of my mother Shashi Mukhi used to make Ayurvedic medicines based on metals at home

 My favorite friends were the Shastras of Ayurveda
 main bhav prakaash par mohit tha, jisane manushya ke swasthya ke liye bhojan kii ore ishaara kiya tha
 i came to know about alcohol or alcohol that it can be beneficial if it is taken in limited quantity, on time, according to age and season
 main un pracheen guruon ko naman karata hum, jinhone apane gyaan ko sankalit kiya
 But upon reaching college, i found that hardly anyone was interested in Ayurveda
 chaatro or shikshakon kaa dhyaan puri tarah pashchimi dawaaiyon par tha
 Since i had seen miraculous treatment of incurable diseases many times in my father's clinic, after graduating in science, i moved to Ayurveda
 meraa lakshya ayurveda ko mukhyadhara kii dawaaiyon ke saath jodna tha
 It must be said that it was a difficult and lonely journey
 hamaara pracheen chikitsa vigyaan ayurveda teen moolbhoot siddhanton par jor detaa he-aahaar yaa khuraaq, vihaar yaa lifestil or aushadh yaa dawaai
 You should avoid taking food that is inconsistent or against
 atah bhojan desh viruddh yaa kshetra ke vipareet ho saktaa he
 If you live in a dry area, do not eat dry or spicy food, or if you live in a marsh area, do not eat greasy food
 kaal yaa mausam ke vipareet na jaaen
 If the apples of the Himalayan foothills are eaten in the south or central India during the peak days of summer, then there will be no benefit
 adhed or bujurg avasthaa main vasa or protein se bharpoor aahaar lenaa aayu viruddh hoga
 The amount of food is also important
 aapke bhojan kaa 25 fisadi thos, 25 fisadi jal or shesh vaayu honi chahie
 If there is a food with more calories, it should be one-third of each
 ayurveda kahata he ki maatra viruddh bhojan ke vipareet prabhaav ho sakate hai
 Do not eat mismatched or accidental food
 jaise muuli, namak, dahi or doodh ke saath machhlee ke sanyog se sharir ko nuksaan hone kii sambhaavna hoti he
 Similarly, do not take food against nature, which can cause allergic reactions
 jaise aanwala bhojan or dawaaiyon main vyapak taur par prayukt hota he, lekin usase kuch logon ko allergy ho sakati he
 Ayurveda warns against the free and careless food now adopted by modern India
 asamay bhojan kii aadat, jaise do baar ke bhojan ke bich kaaphi lanbaa antaraal hona anshan kehalaata he, lagaataar khate jane ko adhyashan kehete hai
 Anything, anytime, and mismatched food with anyone, deep-fried and repeatedly heated food — which disturbs the balance of acid and alkali in the body and causes illnesses — is called a false diet
 duniyabar main samskruti or dharmik vishwaas bhojan ke tareekon ko prabhavit karte hai or vibhinn prakaar ke aahaaron ke viksit hone main madadgaar hote hai
 Going beyond the food systems that have been in place for centuries, people are facing dangerous lifestyle problems
 paramparaagat paddatiyon ko apnaanaa kathin ho saktaa he, lekin apni bhojan sambandhi viraasat ko bhul jane se koi laabh nahin ho saktaa he
 We need to change our lifestyle and food habits by following the Indian culture of food that we have inherited

 Giving details of keeping the repo rate unchanged, RBI Governor Urjit Patel told reporters, "the proposal of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has said that if the loan of farmers on a large scale is waived, then the risk of increasing the fiscal deficit is
 'unhone kaha ki jab tak rajyon ke bajet main vittiya ghaataa sahane kii kshamta nahin aa jaati, tab tak kisaanon ke rin maaf karne se bachanaa chahie
 He said that it can reduce the financial gains made in the last 2-3 years

 haal hi main vivaadon se dur rahane vaali ye actress anjaane main hi ek vivaad main fansati najar ain
 In fact, Sunny gave her number during a scene in the film, which some people understood as Sunny's number
 jab logon ne is number par kol kiya to ye number asal main dilli main rahane vaale ek shaks punit agarwal kaa niklaa
 Puneet started getting many calls and people even abused him on the phone

 pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan kuch hi dinon baad america main raashtrapati donald trump se mulaakaat karenge
 But there is no good news for Pakistan before this meeting
 america congress kii ek report ke mutabik, jab tak pakistan aatankwaadi sanghathanon ke khilaaf koi thos karrwai nahin kar letaa he tabatak america kii ore se milane vaali aarthik madad suspend hi rahegi
 In January 2018, US President Donald Trump banned Pakistan's aid
 aise main pakistan ko ummid thi ki imran khan ke saath mulaakaat ke dauraan aarthik madad par lagi pabandi hat sakati halmerica congress research sarvice (CRS) kii report ke mutabik, ‘pakistan abhi bhi aatanki sanghathanon ke liye jananath kii tarah hi he, pakistani sarkaar lagaataar inako samarthan karti rahi he
 Because of this, Pakistan also has a quarrel with its neighbors
 ’aapako bataa den ki CRS america congress kii ek research wing he, jo lagaataar duniya ke masalon ko maddenjar rakhte hue report taiyaar karti he
 However, this is only a report prepared by an expert, it cannot be called a Congress stance
 apni is report main export ne al-kaayda pramukh osama bin laden kaa bhi zikr kiya he
 The report said that Osama spent time in Pakistan for a long time, but the government there remained silent
 yahi kaaran rahaa he ki trump sarkaar lagaataar pakistan par sakht rukh apanaati rahi he or kai baar america aarthik madad main katautee karata rahaa he
 On the one hand there is a danger of Pakistan getting financial aid from the US, on the other hand the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is also tough on Pakistan
 FATF kaa kahana he ki agar pakistan aatankiyon ke khilaaf karrwai nahin karata he to use blike list main daal diya jayega
 The pension of MISA detainees imprisoned during the Emergency is in danger
 madhyapradesh main sarkaar badalte hi misabandi pension par congress ne ankhen tareri hai
 Congress says that this is a waste of government money
 vahiin bijepi kaa kahana he ki aisa hone par sadan se sadak tak purajor virodh hoga
 Currently, more than 2000 MISABANDI are taking a monthly pension of 25 thousand rupees in Madhya Pradesh
 saal 2008 main shivaraj sarkaar ne misa bandiyon ko 3000 or 6000 pension dene kaa praavdhaan kiya
 Later the pension amount was increased to Rs 10,000
 saal 2017 main misa bandiyon kii pension raashi badhaakar 25000 rupee kii gai
 It costs about 75 crores annually
 congress kaa aarope he ki bijepi sarkaar ne apano ko revadi baantne ke liye aisi karodon kii phijulkharchi kii he
 Congress in-charge of Congress Shobha Ojha said that the BJP government has distributed 25000 rupees per month to the people of Misabandi
 swatantraaa senaniyon ko pension nahin mil rahi thi lekin misa bandiyon ko pension de daali
 The government was robbing Rs 75 crore annually, it should be stopped immediately
 bijepi ke varisht netaa kailash joshi immergency ke dauraan ek maheene tak bhumigat rahe the or iske baad unhen vidhansabha ke daravaaje par giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 Many of his comrades in the state, who remained under detention for 19 months, get MISABANDI pension
 inamen purv mukhyamantri babulal gaur, shivaraj singh chouhan, purv kendriya mantri sartaaj singh jaise log shaamil hai
 Kailash Joshi believes that the pension should not be withdrawn in view of the hardships caused during the Emergency
 jin kaarnon se diya gaya tha ve uchit the
 The party will oppose him
 us samay jo misabandi the, bahut kathinaayee uthaai thi
 It was decided to return it
 vaise duusare dal or nirdaliyon ke sahyog se 121 ke aankade par pahunchi congress sarkaar ke liye pension khatm karnaa aasaan nahin hoga kyonki 2008 main bane lokanayak jaiprakash narayan sammaan nidhi niyam ko 2018 main bijepi ne vidhansabha main adhinium banaakar paarit karvaa liya tha
 The police are also being accused of not taking immediate action on this attack on the girl
 vahiin motihari ke ek duusare hisse main 17 saal kii ladki ke saath bandook kii nok par kathith taur par shaareerik shoshan kiya gaya he
 The family alleges that their daughter has been tortured with a wooden stick but police say the victim has not been raped

 jayanti natarajan ne pradhanmantri ko chitti likhakar chidambaram ke neshnal investment board (enaibi) banane ke prastaav kaa virodh kiya he
 The comments natarajan ne likhaa he ki agar neshnal investment board bana, to yah unke mantralay kii takat ko dabaane jaisaa hoga
 According to the proposal of the Finance Minister, NIB will be given the power to pass projects with investment of more than 1,000 crores
 prastaavit board bade nivesh prastaavon ko manjuuri dene vaale antim nikaay ke rup main kaam karegaa
 After this, no ministry will have the right to object
 natarajan ne apane patr main kaha he ki chunki paryaavarniya manjuuri jaise faisle unka mantralay karata he, to enaibi kii bhoomika kyon honi chahie
 Natarajan has written that if a National Investment Board is formed, it will be like suppressing the strength of his ministry
 vittamantri ke prastaav ke mutabik enaibi ko 1,000 karod se adhik nivesh vaale project paas karne kii takat di jaaegi
 The proposed board will serve as the final body to approve large investment proposals
 iske baad kisi bhi mantralay ko aapatti karne kaa adhikaar nahin hoga
 Natarajan has said in his letter that since his ministry makes decisions like environmental clearances, why should the role of NIB be there
 prastaavit board bade nivesh prastaavon ko manjuuri dene vaale antim nikaay ke rup main kaam karegaa
 After this, no ministry will have the right to object

 a sensational letter written by the Lt
 Governor of Delhi, Anil Baijal, to the Union Home Secretary regarding committees of Delhi Legislative Assembly has come out
 chitthee isi saal 23 july ko likhi gai he jisamen yah aarope tak lagaae gaye hai ki dilli vidhansabha kii athurity kaa beja istemaal kar adhikariyon kii chhavi kharaab kii ja rahi he
 Anil Baijal has also written in a letter to the Union Home Secretary about how the officers are being shown fear of breach of privilege of the committees of the assembly and contempt of the assembly
 unhone likhaa ki is tarah se dilli main sarkari kaam kaaj thap ho jayega
 Actually this letter has been written in view of the proposals in the second report of the Committee on Rules of Delhi Legislative Assembly
 jisamen vibhaagon se sambadhit sthai samitiyon (drscs) ko kai atirikt adhikaar dene kaa zikr he
 The report of the Rules Committee proposes to bring service, vigilance, home, land and building which are reserve subjects within the drscs
 anil baijal ke mutabik ye samvidhan kii dhara 239AA ke khilaaf he
 Anil Baijal also writes in his letter that it is proposed to give powers to the Standing Committees of Delhi Legislative Assembly which are not even with such committees of Parliament
 jaise, dilli vidhansabha main paas masalon par kya kadam sarkaar ne uthaae us par jaanch or report tak ye cameti bana sakati he
 Apart from this, the right to prepare reports by examining, interrogating and even investigating issues related to different departments is also proposed
 uparajyapal ke kendriya grih sachiv ko patr main is baat kaa bhi zikr he ki sansadeey sthai samitiyon ke paas bhi mantralay ke routine kaamon main dakhal kaa adhikaar nahin he or sansadeey cametiyon kaa adhikaar bhi mahaj salaah dena bhar hota he
 The proposed change is therefore against section 18 (3) of the GNCTD Act, 1991
 alji baijal ne apni chitthee main yah bhi likhaa he ki GNCTD Act, 1991 kii dhara 33 ke mutabik inshaktiyon ko dene kaa adhikarbhi vidhansabha ke paas nahin he
 Referring to the prevailing atmosphere in Delhi, the Lieutenant Governor has said that this initiative of giving powers to the committees is an attempt to control and pressurize the officers
 isko pramanit karne ke liye baijal ne dilli jal board ke CEO or swasthya sachiv kii likhit shikaayat kii copy bhi lagaai he
 In view of these facts, the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi Anil Baijal has suggested to the Union Home Secretary to issue necessary instructions under Section 49 of the GNCTD Act, 1991
 jisamen vidhansabha ke naam dhara 9(2) ke andar yah sandesh bheja jaae or yah kaha jaae ki sthai samitiyon ke adhikaar sansadeey samitiyon ke hi anuroop hon or in samitiyon ke daayre main reserve vishay na aate hon
 Baijal has also urged the Union Ministry of Law and Justice to take immediate action on this matter

 hamaari shoharaton kii maut benaamo-nishaan hogi,naa koi tazakira hoga, na koi dastaan hogi
 The news of Jia Khan's suicide has shaken the colorful world of glamor once
 ek baar phir ye sawaal kachotane laga he ki kya tadak-bhadak kii jindagi kaa anjaam tanhai or akelepan ke taur par hi saamne aata he or kya naakaami or gumnami hi aksar maut kii vajah ban jaati he
 Due to such death of fame, Bollywood has not once but two-four times
 2007 se 2010 tak teen badi filmein, 'nishabd', 'gazani' or 'housephul', teenon hit
 Even after this, Jiya could not beat the silver screen on the biggest hero of the three
 teen-teen hit filmon kaa hissaa banane ke baavjood agle teen saal tak jiya ko koi kaam nahin mila
 As soon as Jiya got off the screen, Jiya got down from the Bollywood producers' producers and it was such that even Bollywood South Bollywood people refused to give her work and this is where Jiya's short story ends
 is chamakati duniya kii chakachaundh ne jitanon ko shoharat kii bulandi par pahunchaaya he, usase kahin zyada logon ko gumnami or barbaadi ke andhe kuen main dhakela he
 What to do, this is the way of the world of dreams
 yahaan kaamyaab logon ko log sir ankhon par bithaate hai or naakaam logon ko apane bich se uthaa kar aisa phenkate hai ki phir naa wo sapanom kii is duniya main ji pate hai or naa hamaari or aapaki duniya main
 Even in the midst of a glamorous world of glamor, the darkness of loneliness was swallowed up by Jia Khan
 shoharat kii bulandi se zamin par aa girane ke dar or naakaami or gumnami ke khauf main dubi 25 saal kii jiya ne khud hi apni dhadakanen chhod deen
 Jaya Khan, who came from London to Mumbai to shine on the silver screen, was found dead on Monday night in the same Sagar Tarang apartment flat number 102 in Juhu's apartment
 maut se kuch ghante pehle jiya ne khidki se guladasta baahar kyon phenkaa? aakhri 29 minute tak jiya apane premi se kyon lard rahi thi? jiya ko ye shaq kyon tha ki uskaa premi kisi or ladki se pyaar karata he?maut achaanak hui he, maut kii khabar se har koi sann, sabhi sakate main
 Jia did not leave any suicide note before she died
 jaahir he aise main police sidhe-sidhe cese band karne se pehle har shaq or sawaal ko tatolegi or tatol bhi rahi he or is shaq or sawaal ke bich main sabase aage khadaa he actor aditya pancholi kaa betaa suraj pancholi
 That is, the same lover of Jia Khan with whom Jia had talked and fought for the last time before she died
 jiya duubate filmi kariyar se pareshaan thi, hataash thi
 So just this failure pushed him to death? Or is there some other reason behind this? According to Jia's postmortem report, she had consumed a lot of syrup before she died and had a fight with her boyfriend on the phone till the last moment
 to kya filmon ke saath-saath mohabbat main naakaami bhi jiya kii maut kii vajah bani?taarikh: 03 may 2013jagah: flats number 102, sagar sangeet apartement, mumbaivakt: raat kareeb 11
 00 pm a sudden voice comes out of Bollywood's charming actress Zia Khan's flat
 awaz kisi cheez ke girane kii he
 Meanwhile, neighbors look at a bouquet, which was probably thrown out of Jia's flat
 chunki baat maamuli thi lihaaza koi is par zyada dhyaan nahin detaa
 Jia lived in the flat with her mother and sister
 somvaar raat donon ek party main gaye hue the
 She returns after returning from there but Jia does not open the door
 baad main ghar main daakhil hone ke baad donon ke munh se chikh nikal jaati he
 Here Jia hangs from the fan
 fouran police ko soochna di jaati he or iske baad jo kuch hota he, wo sabko pataa he
 Of course, at first glance the case seems to be a suicide and the way Jia's mother has said that she is in depression, it gets further confirmed but the biggest question is whether Jia lives behind this depression
 Is it a sinking film career or love? postmortem report ko mutabik marane se pehle jiya ne kaaphi maatra main sharba pi thi or uski phone par apane premi suraj pancholi se ladaai bhi hui thi
 Jiya was talking to her boyfriend and actor Aditya Pancholi's son Sooraj Pancholi on mobile, about an hour before the suicide
 kol detail se pataa chalaa he ki jiya or suraj raat 10
 53 to 11
 22 tak phone par baat karte rahe
 After about half an hour, Jia's mother and sister returned home and she was weeping on the fan
 yani maut se pehle jiya ne aakhri baar suraj se hi baat kii thi
 Not only this, it has also been found by checking the SMS box of Jiya's mobile that on Monday night, both of them had also sent many smses to each other
 jiya ne suraj pancholi ko esemes kar uski jindagi main ai ek duusari ladki ke bare main poocha tha
 To which Suraj replied that no other such girl is in his life and he is misunderstanding her
 ab chunki maut se pehle aakhri baatcheet or esemes suraj pancholi se hi hui thi lihaaja police ne suraj se poochtacha kii
 Suraj came with Aditya Pancholi and his mother when he was called for questioning at the Juhu police station
 police ne kai ghante kii poochtacha ke baad haalanki suraj ko chhod diya lekin police sutron ke mutabik suraj ko afi clin chit nahin mili he
 Apparently, by interrogating Suraj, the police wants to know the truth of the last moments of Jiah's life, but there is also a truth that Jiya was upset about her career for the last three years and the people of her own house talked about this Doing evidence gharavaalon kii maane to jiya pichley hafte hi telugu film kii audishan ke liye hairdaabad gai thi lekin baat bani nahin
 It is said that the director had advised Jia to increase her weight for this role but Jia did not agree to it
 haalanki police kaa maananaa he ki agar audishan kii vajah se jiya depressant main thi to wo mumbai lautate hi khudakushi kar leti, itane din intjaar nahin karti
 Police suspect that the case may be not only about career but also of drowning love
 vaise aditya pancholi kaa kahana he ki donon parivaar ke bich kaaphi achche rishte the
 They are also agreeing about Suraj and Jia's affair, but Aditya Pancholi says that the two had a breakup about two months ago

 loksabhaa chunaav main mili karaari haar ke baad vipakshi dalon main samiksha kaa daur jari he
 In such a situation, to stop the chariot of Narendra Modi's Ashwamedha in the Lok Sabha elections and regain his political existence, BSP President Mayawati joined hands with forgetting all the enmity with the SP
 iske baavjood narendra modi kii prachand lahar main sapa-basapa gathbandhan puri tarah dharashayi ho gaya
 After this bitter defeat, now the BSP is going to meet on Monday, June 3 to review the defeat
 basapa adhyaksh mayawati ne 3 june ko dilli main baithak bulaai he
 This is the bsp's first review meeting after the Lok Sabha elections, in which Mayawati has summoned all her newly elected mps, Lok Sabha candidates, zonal incharge and district heads

 Let us tell you that out of 80 Lok Sabha seats of Uttar Pradesh, BJP alliance has won 64 seats
 bijepi 62 or uski sahyogi apana dal 2 seat jeetne main kaamyaab rahi
 The SP-BSP alliance won only 15 seats
 isamen basapa ko 10 or sapa ko 5 siten mili hai
 Whereas, both the mayawati-akhilesh leaders had decided to win more than 50 seats
 lekin chunavi nattejey unki soch ke vipareet aae hai
 In such a situation, both parties have suffered a major setback
 lekin 2019 chunaav main basapa ke saansadon kii sankhya shunya se 10 par pahunch gai he
 BSP supremo Mayawati held a meeting with all the 10 mps on Sunday to discuss their strategy
 loksabhaa chunaavon main pradesh main basapa ne 38 siton par chunaav ladaa tha
 Whereas SP had contested 37 seats
 darasal 2012 ke uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaav se lagaataar basapa kaa graph girtaa ja rahaa tha
 The situation was such that the BSP could not even open an account in the 2014 Lok Sabha
 iske baad 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main basapa mahaj 19 siten hi jeet saki thi
 In this way, the 2019 Lok Sabha elections brought new hope for the BSP, but the alliance of bicycle and elephants got frustrated

 The results of the Kairana and Nurpur by-elections in Uttar Pradesh came on Thursday
 donon siton par bijepi ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa he
 Earlier, in Gorakhpur and Phulpur, the party had to be defeated
 upachunaav main bijepi ko ek ke baad ek mil rahi haar upi kii yogi sarkaar or khaskar pradhanmantri narendra modi ke liye bahut bada jhatka he
 The BJP, which had got bumper seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha and the 2017 assembly elections a year ago, is now stuck in the BJP in the same state
 bataa den ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav or pichley saal 2017 ke upi vidhansabha bijepi ko jo prachand vot mila tha ab usamen send lagani shuru ho gai he
 Whereas in the 2017 election, the BJP ended 14 years of power exile in UP and recorded a historic victory with 325 seats
 ye bhi padhein
 
 4 loksabhaa, 10 vidhansabha siton ke upachunaavon kaa FINAL resultbijepi ke liye ye karishma piem narendra modi ke chehre kii vajah se hua tha
 No one was declared CM candidate from BJP in the assembly elections, but after the results came, PM Modi and party president Amit Shah handed over the reins of power to Yogi Adityanath
 jaateey santulan bikharabijepi jis jaateey santulan ko sadhakar satta main ai thi, yogi adityanath use saath lekar chalane main safal nahin ho sake hai
 The most important role in the bjp's victory was the OBC and the Dalit community
 lekin shashan or satta main unhen uchit bhagidaari nahin di gai
 Apart from this, violent incidents like Saharanpur also occurred between Rajputs and Dalits in Yogi Raj
 iske alaava siem par ek jati vishesh ko hi badhaava dene kaa bhi aarope lage
 This is the reason why many ministers of the Yogi government have also questioned it
 jabaki vipaksh ne iskaa phayda uthaate hue obisi or dalit samudaay ko saadhane kaa prayaas kiya, jisamen ve kaamyaab hote dikh rahe hai
 Felmodi, the engine of development, is an MP from Varanasi in UP
 aise main avam ko ummid thi ki jis prakaar gujarat main vikaas karke dikhaaya he, usee tarj par upi main bhi vikaas hoga
 The Prime Minister of UP had announced to be the engine of development
 unhone kaha tha ki 2019 se pehle soobe ko desh main vikaas ke ingine ke taur par sthapit karenge
 More than a year has passed since the BJP government was formed in the state, but the government has nothing special to count on the name of development
 sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav kehete hai, ' upi kaa vikaas yogi se nahin hoga, wo sirf puja paath acha kar sakate hai
 'adityanath Yatri Yogi of lucknow-gorakhpur is the CM as well as the Mahant of Gorakhnath Math
 paanch baar ve gorakhpur loksabhaa se saansad rahe hai
 This is the reason that they are not able to get themselves out of Gorakhpur
 maheene main do se teen daura unka sirf gorakhpur kaa ho rahaa he
 Due to this, the opposition is constantly raising questions that they are going to worship at Gorakhnath temple every week
 hindutv kaa agenda pichheyogi adityanath kai varshon tak khud ko ek kattar hindutvvaadi raajnneeti chehre the
 After becoming CM, Yogi took a new avatar, so his slogan was, 'no discrimination from anyone and no pleading
 ' lekin ab ve apni chhavi se vipareet najar aa rahe hai, jo bijepi ke kattar samarthakon ko raas nahin aa rahaa he
 Yogis are sweeping outside the Taj Mahal, talking about going to the mosque, and making madrasas modern
 yogi kii badali chhavi se hindutv kaa agenda peeche chhutata ja rahaa he
 The Ram temple was the core issue of the BJP in Khamoshi Ayodhya
 centre or rajya main bijepi kii sarkarein hone ke baad bhi party ramamandir maamle par khamoshi akhriyaar kiye hue he
 While in opposition, Yogi Adityanath Ram Mandir has been taking up the matter fiercely
 ab jab satta main hai to maamle ko aapasi baatcheet se sulajhane yaa phir court se jariye hal karne kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 Kairana did not become a laboratory The Rashtriya Lok Dal and sp's victory over Nurpur assembly seat on the Kairana Lok Sabha seat has strengthened the foundation of the opposition parties
 bijepi tamaam koshishon ke baavjood in siton par dhruvikaran karaane main naakaam rahi
 Social equations like Kairana are in many districts of West UP
 yah vahi ilaaka he jahaan 2013 ke dangon ke baad bijepi ke paksh main 2014 ke loksabhaa or 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main sampradayik aadhaar par maton kaa dhruvikaran hua tha
 As a result, the BJP had a unilateral victory in western UP
 kairana se sate bagpat main choudhary ajit singh ko bhi apni sansadeey seat ganvaani padi
 In the last two elections, there was a gap between Jats and Muslims
 kairana main muslim pratyaashee utarkar voton kaa dhruvikaran rokna ralod ke liye kisi pariksha se kam nahin tha
 Ralod passed in it
 usne kairana ko dhruvikaran kii prayogshaala banane se roak diya
 More than a year has passed for the Yogi government, but the BJP is continuously suffering losses rather than gains
 mukhyamantri or upmukhyamantri ko apni sansadeey seat ganvaani pad chuki he
 After this, BJP was also seen in Kairana and Nurpur
 wo bhi us samay jab loksabhaa chunaav nazadik he, ye bijepi ke liye khatre kii ghanti he
 In such a situation, questions are now being raised whether making Yogi the CM of UP was PM Modi's biggest political mistake? manesar main maaruti kii factory main 21 agast se kaam phir shuru ho jayega

 When so many people are standing, why are rumors being spread about two or four names like us? taaki koi sarkaar se sawaal na kare? koi pradhanmantri modi se yah na puche ki shok ke samay aap kisi sarkari kaarykram main apane liye vot kaise maang sakate hai
 You should listen to his speech given in Jhansi
 pradhanmantri ko raajnneeti karne kii chhot he magar baaki sabko nahin
 The right information is not being allowed to reach the people through the dock media
 ardh sainik balon ko pataa he ki unki baat karne vaala is godi media main hameen hai
 We have supported them in their demands ranging from pension to salary
 siarpief or biguef kaa commandent jivan laga detaa he magar apane hi force kaa netritv use nahin miltaa
 We have discussed this
 kya bijepi kaa adhyaksh koi congress kaa ho saktaa he? to kis hisaab se yuddhrat sthiti main tainaat siarpief or biesaf kaa netritv ipies karata he? saansad or vidhayak ko pension milti he, magar hamaare javaanon ko pension kyon nahin milti he? yah sawaal main pehle se karata rahaa hum or is vakt bhi karuunga
 In July 2016, a 6000-page inquiry report was reported by Sir John Chilcott in Brittany
 12 khandon main 26 lakh shabdon se yah report bani thi
 When the report came after seven years of investigation, it was named The Iraq Inquiry
 sar chilcott ko zimmedaari di gai thi ki kya 2003 main iraq par hamalaa karnaa sahi or zaruri tha? yah us desh kii ghatana he jisane kai yuddh dekhe hai
 The modern kind of morality and sentiment about war has developed from these European countries
 us vakt britain main iraq yuddh ke khilaaf das lakh log sadakon par utre the
 He was then called a supporter of terrorism
 britain dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad pehali baar kisi yuddh main shaamil hua tha
 Saddam Hussein was said to have chemical weapons that destroy humanity
 jise angrezi main vepan of maas distroction kaha jaataa he
 Chilkat wrote in his report that Iraq had no justification for the claims made on the dangers of possessing chemical weapons
 sar chilkat kii report is nattejey par pahunchi he ki britain ne yuddh main shaamil hone kaa faisla karne se pehle shantipurna vikalpon kaa chunaav nahin kiya
 At that time military action was not the last option
 jab yuddh hua tha tab tony blair ko hero kii tarah media ne cover pej par chapa tha
 Tony Blair's image was also strong and honest
 chilkat cameti ne likhaa ki blair ne ek mulk ke lakhon logon ko maravane ke khel main shaamil hone ke liye apane mantrimandal se jhooth bolaa
 Lied to his parliament
 jab yah report ai tab lebar party ke netaa jermi corbin ne iraq or britain kii janata or un sainikon ke pariwaron se maafee maangi jo iraq yuddh main maare gaye yaa jinke ang cat gaye
 The Sun is the first newspaper in London
 uski hedline thi ‘san baks blair'
 Blair has flax in his hand and the Sun newspaper is in support of Blair
 jab chilkat cameti kii report ai tab isi san akhbaar ne hedline chhaapi ‘vepan of maas disepshan'
 In Hindi means weapon of mass deception
 daily mirar akhbaar ne tab jo kaha tha wo das saal baad sahi niklaa
 Printed on the first page of the newspaper on 29 January 2003, both of Blair's palms are blood-soaked
 likhaa tha blad on hiz hands- tony blair
 Every country has its own situation
 bas aap is kahani se yah jaan sakate hai ki kai baar kisi agyaat maksadon ke liye rashtradhyaksh mulk ko yuddh main dhakel dete hai
 So do not panic with any kind of question
 sawaal desh virdohi nahin hote hai
 This gives the right information to come out and increases public confidence
 janata bheed nahin banati he
 War should not be decided by crowds but between strategists
 yuddh ek vyarth upkram he
 This does not lead to any result
 kai jagahon par kashmiri chaatro ko maaraa jane laga he
 Is it true? The terrorist who had left Masood Azhar may have left the ship, you know who left, but you are killing those who have nothing to do
 siarpief ne kashmiri chaatro kii madad ke liye helpline number jari kiya he
 Go to crpf's tweeter handle and it says that wherever you are, contact us
 kya aapmen himmat he ki siarpief par ungali uthaane kii? salaam he siarpief ko
 So there is no benefit from calling me
 pradhanmantri se puuchhie
 They have all the answers
 aapas main zehar mat bantie
 Be united sari bahes tark ke aadhaar par kiijie
 Pakistan should definitely learn a lesson
 har haal main sikhaana chahie magar pehle naagarik hone kaa sabak sikh len to behrat hoga
 We are in mourning
 thik he ki sara jivan purvavat chal rahaa he
 But when the idea comes, the mind is depressed
 sanyam banaae rakhen
 Beware of sly leaders
 jhaansi main ek aspataal kii laaparvaahee kaa ek or maamla saamne aayaa he
 Where a 15-year-old boy was thrown on the garbage dump by the hospital administration
 kuch din pehle is ladke ko jhaansi ke lakshmibai medical college main ek ilaaj ke liye bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 But no relatives of his came to see the boy
 parijanon kii jaankaree nahin milane ke baad aspataal ke kamarchaariyon ne biimaar ladke ko aspataal se baahar phenk diya
 The boy is in critical condition right now

 notebandi kaa asar kheti-kisaani par bhi padaa he
 When the 'aajtak' team reached Durjanpur in Haryana, on the farmyard and the fair price of the crop, the farmers told their problems
 lekin ve sabhi deshhit main notebandi kaa samarthan kar rahe the
 Farmer Mahendra Mewar says that Modi's decision benefits a lot in farming
 jo thodi samasya aa rahi thi, vah card pement se dur kii ja rahi hai
 Paying by card or check is also in the market
 lekin, kai baar fasalon kii bikri main kam rate lagaaya jaataa he
 This reduces profits
 kisaan kaa to yah kahana he ki jo ratenotbandise pehle milte the wo ab pehle se kaaphi kam rate par bechnaa pad rahaa he, jisase unki kaaphi mushkil ho gai he
 On the other hand, businessmen also believe that their business has been greatly affected
 jis vajah se vah kisaan ko utani rate nahin de paa rahe
 Therefore, he has to pay by check
 bainkon se lambii lambii linon ke baad bhi vyapaar ke liye utraa paisa nahin mil paa rahaa he or cashles abhi shuru nahin hua he
 The farmers who came to sell the crop in the grain market of Hisar said that they are still struggling with problems
