 The police did not take long to understand that the case could be of murder, based on the evidence found on the occasion
 lihaaja murder ke angel se maamle kii tafteesh shuru kii gai
 The deceased was identified as Sukhdev Singh, a resident of village Vander Jatana
 iske baad railway police ne maamle kii jaankaree thana sadar kotkapura police ko di
 While proceeding with the investigation of the case, the police station questioned some villagers, including Jasvir Kaur, wife of the deceased Sukhdev, in custody
 isi dauraan mritak kii patni jasvir cor par police ko shaq hua
 When the police strictly questioned him, the whole matter was opened
 police ko pataa chalaa ki mritak sukhdev kii patni jasvir cor ne katl kii puri sajeesh rachi thi, jisaki vajah thi uske avaidh sambandh
 Jasvir had a love affair with a young man named Harmanpreet Singh, in which Sukhdev Roda was made

 Jasvir Kaur and Harmanpreet, who used to wear a jama, took Sukhdev to a field on the pretext and killed him with a sharp weapon

 tisare test main jis tarah se kohli ke dhurandharon ne khel dikhaakar match jeeta, vah kaabiletarif tha or har kisi ko laga ki chauthe test main maamla barabari par pahunch saktaa he
 In the entire series, Captain Virat Kohli came to stand like a rock and many other players remained like those who were just a burden on the team
 sabhi khilaadiyon se ummid thi, lekin vah kuch nahin kar sake
 These five players proved to be a weak link for the team
 1
 Murali Vijaybataur Test opener Murali Vijay has confirmed his place in the team in the recent past
 gharelu series main unhone lagaataar acha pradarshan bhi kiya, lekin jab is baar team ko unase ummid thi to bilkul fail sabit hue
 Vijay was able to score a total of 32 runs in the first two Tests, after which he had to sit out
 test main opening kaaphi mahatvapurn hoti he lekin bhartiya team is morche par fail hi rahi
 2
 shikhar dhawanmurali vijay kii tarah hi unke jodidar shikhar dhawan ne apane pradarshan se har kisi ko naaraaz kiya
 When Shikhar Dhawan stepped into Test cricket, his technique and enthusiasm were tremendous, everyone hoped that he would prove to be Gabbar even on foreign ground
 lekin is daure par shikhar dhawan koi badi pari nahin khel paae
 He got a chance in three Tests but could not cross the score of 50 in any innings
 3
 KL Rahul, who came into the Test team after performing brilliantly in the Indian Premier League and ODI T20, also disappointed on this tour
 captain viraat kohli ne bure pradarshan ke baad bhi rahul kaa saath diya lekin vah is par khare nahin utre
 In the entire Test series, Rahul did not play any big innings and only managed 113 runs
 4
 When Hardik Pandyakoi young cricketer performs well in the beginning, his expectations are doubled
 hardik pandya ke saath bhi aisa hua, cricket ke chote formet main unhone shandaar pradarshan kiya auki logon ne unhen nayaa kapil dev bana diya
 But he could not fill an all-rounder's place in Test cricket
 shaayad, england ourbharatamen ek bada antar ye bhi rahaa
 In many places, it seemed that perhaps Ravindra Jadeja could be the best choice in place of Hardik
 5
 Dinesh Karthikinesh Karthik was brought into the team due to injury to Riddhiman Saha
 lekin acchhee form or anubhav hone ke baavjood karthik ne niraash kiya
 Karthik was given a chance in the first two matches, in which he scored very few runs
 jiske baad yuva rishabh pant ko team main laayaa gaya, unhone bataur wicketiper to acha role nibhaayaa
 But he also failed as a batsman
 australian ballebajphil hujeske ek bounsar se buree tarah se ghayal hone ke baad bounsaron par phir se charchaa ho rahi he
 a cricket ball whose maximum weight is a quarter to six ounces, when it is thrown at a bar of 22 miles at a speed of 100 miles, reaches the batsman before the blink of an eye and becomes fatal when it suddenly arises
 
 kai nami-giraami ballebaajon ko yah aspataal pahunchaa chuki he inamen riki ponting, mike gaiting jaise bade khilaadi to shaamil hi hai, bharat ke purv captain nari contractor bhi hai
 Thirty years ago, helmets started trending in cricket but before that batsmen used to come batting without that armor
 unamem se kai khilaadi tej raftaar bounsaron se ghayal hokar aspataal ja pahunchate the
 Among them was India's captain Nari Contractor, who was a bouncer for storm bowler Charlie Griffith while batting in the 1961–62 series in the West Indies
 unki khopadi kii haddi tut gai thi or doctoron ko unki jaan bachaane ke liye unka oparation tak karnaa padaa
 After that, his cricket life came to an end
 agar puraane maamle yaad kiye jaaen to cricket itihaas kii sabase buree ghatana england main hui jab 1870 main english lig cricket main yuva tej gendbaaj jon plats kii tufaani gend kaa shikaar jorge samars naam kaa ballebaaj hua
 The rising ball on Lord's pitch hit Summers head
 use ghar le jaaya gaya jahaan chaar dinon ke baad uski maut ho gai
 England's tempestuous bowler Harold Larwood injured the most players
 darasal body line gendbaaji unki hi khoj thi jisane cricket khilne kaa tarika hi badal diya
 In the 1932–33 series, a fast ball from Larwood made Australia's batsman Burt Oldfield all four
 newjiland ke evan chatfield kaa kissa to kaaphi mashhoor he
 In the 1974–75 England and New Zealand series, the England team was heading towards victory, but Chatfield bravely kept the team from defeat
 is par england ke tej gendbaaj peter liver ko gussa aa gaya or unhone ek dandanaata hua bounsar pataka
 The ball hit Chatfield's forehead and he fell unconscious on the pitch
 england team ke physio ne unhen saans dekar phir se jinda kar diya
 Seeing him unconscious, Lever started crying
 lekin helmet yug aane ke baad halaat kuch badale or ballebaajon ko kaaphi raahat mili phir bhi kai bade khilaadi bounsaron ke shikaar hote rahe
 They also included Justin Langer
 australia ke is ballebaaj ko to do baar bounsaron se ghayal kiya
 In 1992–93 Ian Bishop, the West Indian storm bowler, was hit on his head and had to leave the tour and return home
 aisa laga ki vah cricket se ritairement le lenge
 He was seconded by South African fast bowler Makhaya Antini in the 2005–06 series
 antini kii bounsar unke sir par lagi or unhen aspataal le jaaya gaya
 He could not play any further matches
 australia ke shandaar ballebaaj riki ponting bhi bounsar kaa shikaar ho chuke hai
 Ponting got Steve Hermison's bouncer in 2005 at Lord's
 pehle to unhen kuch pataa hi nahin chalaa lekin baad main dekha gaya to unke sir se khun bah rahaa tha
 Most batsmen were alarmed by West Indies storm bowler Malcolm Marshall
 taqatvar marshall apni short pich gendon ke liye mashhoor the
 In the 1985–86 series, he hit a great ball to England captain Mike Gatting
 vah gaiting kii naak par lagi or khun kii dhar bah nikali or unhen baahar le janaa padaa
 Marshall then scared the batsmen so much that no one was able to stand in front of them on the bouncy pitches of the West Indies in that series
 zyaadaatar ballebaaj jaldi se jaldi out ho janaa chaahate the
 They were courageous players but there were many batsmen who came back to play even after being injured by fast balls
 inamen se ek khilaadi kaa kissa yahaan bataanaa jaruri he
 Most people do not know his name
 vah the sultan jaraavai jo karodpati the or shaukia cricket khelte the
 He was also the captain of the UAE team
 unka muqabla 1996 main rawalpindi main dakshin africa ke khatarnaak gendbaaj ellen donald se hua
 He wore a hat instead of a helmet
 donald kii pehali hi gend uthati hui bounsar thi
 The ball hit Zaravai's head and bounced
 lekin kuch hi second baad unhone apana hat uthaaya or phir ballebaaji karne chale aae
 He was dismissed after six balls but left an impression of his bravery
 england ke mahaan ballebaaj denis crompton ko 1948 main re lindwall ne apane bounsar se buree tarah jakhmi kar diya
 He had two stitches on his head but did not panic and returned from the hospital to bat
 unhone us match main shandaar 145 naabad ran banaae
 Raman Lamba's tragic end: Delhi's finest batsman Raman Lamba went to Bangladesh to play in the league there
 1998 main dhaka main jab vah fielding kar rahe the to ek ballebaaj ne gend ko jor se unki ore maaraa
 Before Lamba could take any action, the ball hit his forehead and he died after three days in the hospital
 unki umr mahaj 38 saal thi
 Lamba also played 32 One Day and 4 Tests for India

 In the eyes of the people, Rae Bareli is Priyanka's legacy because it is their natural inheritance on this family seat
 lekin wadra ne yah bayaan dekar sara ganit bigaad diya
 It is said that even Vadra is eyeing the Prime Minister's chair and he has started giving voice to this ambition

 Kalyan told India Today, "that's why i organized a bike rally for him in Salon, the reserved seat of Rae Bareli
 bike par chadhane se pehle wadra ji ne do reliyon ko sambodhit kiya
 The rally was in support of local Congress candidate Shiva Balak Pasi, who was seen sitting on a bike behind Vadra, though the truth was that the event was held to bring Vadra behind the scenes

 In March 2011, a business newspaper wrote in detail on his "silent and unhindered entry" into the real estate business, including a partnership and his partnership and dealings with DLF, the country's largest realty firm

 i wanted to invest in real estate and this relationship helped me
 '' haalanki yah sabit karne main puraa jor lagaaya ki apana kaarobaar ve khud apane dam par chalaa rahe hai

" congress kaa kendriya netritv bhi tay nahin kar paa rahaa ki wadra se kaise nibata jaae; jaahir he shaadi-byaah ke rishte hote hi najuk hai
 The questions are many, for example, has Vadra got permission from Sonia Gandhi? Is he putting pressure on his wife? The party's official line was put forward by General Secretary Janardan Dwivedi and spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi on this issue
 singhvi ne kaha, ''logon ne wadra ke bayaan ko alag sandarbh main le liya he
 i have nothing to say after Priyanka Gandhi's statement on her husband's political ambitions
 '' priyanka kii safai ke baad wadra ke bayaan par unhone kuch nahin kaha

 The Supreme Court has issued a notice to the accused students on the plea of the victim and sought an answer

 The trio had sought release on bail as the appeal was pending with the High Court
 unki arji ko manjuur karte hue hoicourt ne unki sazaa nilambit kar di ore shart laga di ki is dauraan teenon desh chhodkar nahin jaaenge
 i will not try to contact the student in any way and will consult a psychiatrist till his voyeuristic tendencies persist
 teenon ke abhibhavakon ko nirdesh diya gaya he ki is mudde par wo chah maheene baad court main report daakhil karenge
 The High Court, while giving the verdict, said that they want to strike a balance between the concern of the victim, the demand of society and law and corrective and rehabilitation justice
 ye ek majaak hoga ki yuva man ko lambey vakt tak jail main kaid rakhaa jaae jo unhen shiksha, khud ke mukt hone ke maukey or saamaanya tareeke se samaaj hissaa banane se vanchit karegaa
 The comments bench ne kaha ki lambey vakt tak kaid main rakhana unke liye apoorniy kshati ho sakati he kyonki apil kuch samay tak lambit rahegi
 In our opinion, as long as this appeal is pending, in the possibility of another crime, they fear that if the appeal fails, they will be imprisoned for a long time
 itnaa hi nahin bench ne ye tak kaha ki ye peedit kaa hinsa ke prati ‘ cajual’ vyavhaar he jo sajaa nilamban ke badhyakaari kaaran hai
 Nowhere in the victim's statements did any other aspect of normal behavior, adventurousness and experimentation with acquaintances in sexual offenses come to pass and these facts are the compelling reasons for suspending the conviction, even then the accused are young and the victim has made unpleasant behavior towards violence
 She did not show up and kept up with the events in the usual way
 bench ne ye bhi kaha ki ye ghatana yuva man kii drugs, sharaab or saamaanya yon dussahas ke khatarnaak soch kii pratibimb he or ye ek bhramit va drishyratik duniya he
 The order said on the basis of the victim's statements that the youth need to go and peep into the immature but nefarious world where the youth do not realize the value of the relationship based on respect and mutual understanding
 teenon ne hoicourt se apil lambit hone kii vajah se jamaanat par reeha karne kii maang kii thi
 Approving his plea, the High Court suspended his conviction and bet that the three countries would not leave during this time
 chaatra se kisi bhi tarah sampark karne kii koshish nahin karenge or apana drishyratik pravritiyon ke bane rahane tak manochikitsak se counselling karaayenge
 The parents of the three have been instructed to file a report in the court after six months on this issue
 hai court ne faisla sunaate hue kaha ki wo peedit kii chintaa, samaaj kii maang or kanoon or sudharatmak evam punarvaas nyaay ke bich balance bananaa chaahate hai
 It would be a joke to keep the young minds imprisoned for a long time which would deprive them of education, opportunities to free themselves and to be a part of society in a normal way
 tippaniyan The Bench held that incarceration for a long period of time could cause irreparable damage to them as the appeal would be pending for some time

 The bench also said that this incident is a reflection of the young minds' dangerous thinking of drugs, alcohol and general sexual adventurism and is a confused and voyeuristic world
 aadesh main peedit ke bayanon ke aadhaar par kaha gaya he ki yuvaaon kii aparipakv lekin napak duniya main jane or jhaankne kii jarurat he jahaan yuvaaon ko sammaan or aapasi samaj par aadhaarit rishtein kii keemat kaa ahsaas nahin he

 Panoon Kashmir (PK) President Ashwini Kumar Shrungu said that whatever views the interlocutors put forth, they are different from the feelings of the entire country in Kashmir
 unhone kaha ki vaartakaron main se ek, dilip padaganvkar ne kashmir maamle ko ‘vivaad’ kii sangya di, jo kisi bhi tarah se sweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Regarding a recent conference in Delhi, the PK leader said that all the faces present in the seminar were those who 'openly symbolize separatism and terrorism in India'

 The conference, being organized at the initiative of Obama, will focus on the dangers posed by the spread of stolen nuclear, illegal trafficking of nuclear substances and the possibility of nuclear materials coming into the hands of terrorists

 chhattisgarh ke samikarnapako bataa den ki chhattisgarh main kul 90 vidhansabha siten hai
 The state currently has a total of 11 Lok Sabha and 5 Rajya Sabha seats
 chhattisgarh main kul 27 jile hai
 a total of 51 seats in the state are reserved for general, 10 seats for SC and 29 seats for ST
 2013 main raman singh hetric2013 main vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey 8 disambar ko ghoshit kiye gaye the
 Among these, BJP formed the government for the third time in the state by defeating the Congress
 raman singh kii aguwai main bijepi ko 2013 main kul 49 vidhansabha siton par jeet mili thi
 While the Congress was able to win only 39 seats
 jabaki 2 siten anya ke naam gai thim
 Despite the BJP getting three seats less than in 2008, they formed their government with an absolute majority
 raman singh 2003 se rajya ke mukhyamantri hai
 The amendment bill introduced in the Constitution to provide 10 per cent reservation to the poor citizens of all religions, has passed in the Lok Sabha
 loksabhaa main bill par kul 326 saansadon ne matdaan kiya, jinamein se 323 ne sanshodhan kaa samarthan kiya, jabaki 3 saansadon ne bill kaa virodh kiya
 That is, the amendment bill giving reservation to upper castes was passed by a majority of more than two-thirds of the members present in the Lok Sabha
 ab yah bill rajyasabha main pesh kiya jayega
 The government believes that amending the Constitution will not make it easy to challenge this decision in the Supreme Court
 kuch vipakshi dal jahaan yah aadesh supreme court main khaarij hone kaa daawa kar rahe hai, vahiin sarkaar ko ummid he ki is kanoon ke khilaaf jane waalon ko court nakaar degi
 But political decisions are also being taken out of this decision of Modi government
 is tarah ke sawaal bhi uth rahe hai ki aakhir sansad ke aakhri satr ke aakhri dinon main hi yah kyon laayaa gaya?savarna aarakshan or siyaasi sameekaran2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko mili 282 siton main 256 siten 14 rajyon se mili thim
 There are 341 Lok Sabha seats in these 14 states, out of which the upper caste voters are decisive in about 180 seats
 maharashtra main kareeb 25 seat, haryana, dilli or uttarakhand kii 5-5 seat, himachal kii 4 seat par savarna voter nirnaayak hai
 Talking about Gujarat, it affects 12 here, 14 of MP, 14 in Rajasthan, about 20 seats in Bihar and 6 seats in Jharkhand
 akele upi main 35 se 40 siten aisi hai, jahaan savarna voter kisi kii jeet yaa haar tay karte hai
 In such a situation, this masterstroke of the Modi government just before the 2019 general elections can also prove to be detrimental to the opposition's solidarity and the bjp's winning chariot may be re-routed
 kise, kitna aarakshanis sab ke bich yah samaj lete hai ki desh main ab tak aarakshan paane waalon kii sthiti kya he or nai aarakshan niti lagu hone par kitne logon ko iskaa laabh mil paaegaa
 16 in the country
 6 fisadi anusuchit jati (SC) aabaadi he, jise 15% aarakshan miltaa he
 While 8
 6 fisadi anusuchit janajati (ST) aabaadi he jise 7
 5% reservation is available
 desh main kareeb 41% anya pichhadaa varg (OBC) aabaadi he, jise 27% aarakshan miltaa he
 Apart from these, about 34 per cent of the people are those who fall in the general category and are currently out of the reservation system and the Modi government is bringing 10 per cent reservation for such general category poor, who are yet to get any benefit
 yani modi sarkaar kaa yah faisla agar lagu ho jaataa he, iskaa laabh paane vaala desh kaa ek bada varg hoga
 Interestingly, the Modi government decided to benefit by breaking the boundaries of religion and caste, which could prove to be a milestone from the electoral point of view
 aarthik rup se pichhadon kii pahchaan ke liye bana tha kamishandesh main aarakshan kii vyavastha aazaadee ke baad se hi chali aa rahi he
 Other backward classes were given reservation in 1990 after arranging reservation for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes
 iske baad aarthik taur par pichde samaaj kii pahchaan or use aarakshan kaa laabh dene kii koshish shuru hui
 Under this, the EBC commission was created in July 2006 under the chairmanship of Major General Retired SR Sinha
 iskaa kaam EBC yani aarthik taur par pichde varg kii pahchaan karne or unki dasha dekhakar sifarish karne kaa tha
 The SR Sinha Commission in its 2010 report gave information about the economically weaker section
 sinha kamishan kii report
 
 
 
 -tex bharne tak kii kamai naa kar paane vaale savarnon ko OBC kii tarah se dekhnaa chahie
 There are 5 to 6 crore people who should get reservation like SC-ST
 -ayog ne apni report main is varg ko aarakshan sahit 14 siforishein kii thi
 In particular, there was a recommendation for reservation in jobs and colleges for upper castes
 -aarakshan na paane vaale aarthik rup se kamazor varg kii aabaadi kareeb 17% he
 Among the economic backward, 18 percent are below the poverty line
 -savarna jatiyon main kareeb 6 fisadi aise log hai, jinke paas koi zamin tak nahin he
 - There are about 65 percent people who have less than one hectare of land
 report ke mutabik, dalit or adivasee ke baraabar aisi savarna aabaadi he, jo garibi rekha se neeche he
 In such a situation, if seen according to these figures, this decision of the Modi government can help in the development of a large section of the country, which is considered to be very important in view of the 2019 elections

 sunil kumaar ne iske baavjood praathmik jaanch kaa aadesh nahin diya or kunjuman kaa bayaan darj nahin kiya
 When he insisted, the officer arrested him and charged him with killing an elephant child
 vidambnaa yah thi ki isi hatya kii vajah se kunjuman ne taskaron kaa saath chhod diya tha
 Kunjuman insisted on recording his statement and after that a news became public that the local forest officials were trying to suppress a smuggling case

 From the sting operation, it seems that these artists take a large part of their wages as black money and illegally send it to abroad

 Agents and managers of all these Pakistani artists have been imprisoned on intelligence cameras demanding their fees in black
 kuch ne to yahaan tak kaha ki unhen ye rakam cash main di jaae or wo ise le jane kaa intjaam khud kar lenge
 At the same time, some even demanded that it be deposited in the bank accounts of Australia or Dubai
 pakistani kalakaar videsh mantralay kii ore se jari work permit par bharat aate hai
 This permit is given to them to work in India, so to demand black money is to directly break Indian laws

 buudhvaar ko sumit or bhagyashri kisi kaam se baahar ja rahe the
 Suddenly, Bhagyashree's brother Balaji Landage came there in the car after a shower
 uske saath uske dost bhi the
 Before this, Bhagyashree could understand something
 uske bhai ne apane saathiyon ke saath milakar sumit pardhardaar hathiyaarase hamalaa kar diya
 He made several blows to Sumit's stomach and chest one after the other
 sumit lahooluhaan hokar sadak par gir gaye
 The people present there did not come to save Sumit after seeing the weapon in the hands of the attackers
 is dauraan bhagyashri madad ke liye guhaar lagaati rahi
 The brother kept praying but he had blood on his head
 vaardaat ko anjaam dekar wo vahaan se bhaag niklaa
 Bhagyashree took Sumit to the district hospital with the help of people
 lekin khun zyada bah jane ke kaaran uskimautaho gai
 On receiving the information, the police also reached the hospital and took Sumit's body in possession and sent it for postmortem
 is sambandh main police ne bhagyashri kii taharir par uske bhai balaji landge samet anyaaropiyonke khilaaf ipisi kii dhara 302 ke tahat maamla darj kar liya he
 Now the police has started searching for the accused
 haal ke varshon main netritv ke maamle main hamane agar koi cheez sikhi he to vah yah ki bauddhikta ko jarurat se zyada or sankalpaikti ko kam ahmiyat di gai he
 While choosing leaders, we naturally tend to be more inclined towards their views than their work, whereas history has taught us that great leaders are those who did good things, not those who were good thinkers
 shreshth netaaon main hameshaa hi sankalp, uddeshy or dridhtaa ke gun paae jate hai, inase duniya ko badalane main madad mili he
 Our previous Prime Minister was possibly the most intellectual and academic achiever with a phd from Oxford
 lekin ve asafal rahe
 He neither had the effective will nor the ability to put his thoughts into action to stop the events happening in the country
 haal hi vidaa hui sust chaal or lakwagrast sarkaar se bhannaae bhartiya voter ne ab ek bilkul alag tarah ke netaa ko chunaa he
 Narendra Modi has an understanding of purpose, it is his ability to pay attention to the remaining details of work
 upar se jabardast damakham or sankalpaikti
 a person who can make things work has these essential qualifications
 aisa shaks jaanata he ki chizon ko sahi raste par kaise laayaa jaataa he
 During his election campaign these qualities were fully demonstrated and if he ran the country in the same way as the election campaign, then we have every good reason to hope
 bharat kii samasyaon ke hal ke liye nae vichaaron or nae kanoonon kii nahin balki puraane vichaar or puraane kanoon behatar dhang se lagu karne kii jarurat he
 Modi reminded us of this truth many times last year
 unhen jo log acchhee tarah se jaanate hai, unka bhi yahi kahana he ki modi kii takat chizon ko kriyanvit karne main he
 This time we have got such an executive charge for the country which is able to bring results
 is vajah se hi mujh jaise udaaravaadi, dharmanirpeksh vyakti ko jise hindutv yaa bijepi main koi aakarshan nahin, usne bhi modi ko vot diya tha
 Reputed management consulting firm mckinsey & Co, in the Hindustani strategy, behind implementing it, in its famous global study of the 1990s found that well-performing companies have excelled because of implementation
 bharat ke bare main iske aankadon se is baat kii pushti hui ki yahaan karrwai kaa maamla lachar he
 a sample of 35 major Indian companies after interviews with more than 600 top executives came to the conclusion: "the performance of many Indian companies is good in formulating strategy, but they lag behind in implementing it
" ’’akasar videshi hamen yah yaad dilaate hai ki bhartiya log pratibhavan hai, lekin kaaphi vinamrata se yah bhi jod dete hai ki ‘‘ve jarurat se zyada hoshiyaar’’ lagate hai
 Indians think and argue a lot, look at many aspects, but do not work
 is vajah se tallenced logon kii bhartee mushkil ho jaati he kyonki ham achche intervyuu to kar lete hai, lekin yah kaise tay karenge ki inamen se kaam karke dikhaane vaale kitne hai or sirf baat karne vaale kitne? bhartiya jivan main bas chintan karne or kaam karne ke bich kii yah khai itani gahari he ki kai baar main maayoos hokar sochataa hum ki kamjor kriyanvayan hamaari charitragat khami he
 From my own experiences working as a manager and later as a board member or consultant, i can confirm that most managers usually have a good strategy, but they are weak to implement
 main privet equity fund se bhi judaa hum, jisane pichley 10 saal main kai bhartiya companiyon main invest kiya he or is anubhav se meri yah dharna phir se pusht hui haih sarvshereshth form vah nahin hoti jiske paas behtareen kaarobaari model ho, balki vah he jiske paas kriyanvayan kii sarvshereshth kshamta ho
 From selling tea on a railway platform in a small town in Gujarat to reaching 7, Race Course Road, Narendra Modi's story reflects his style of leadership as well as many more
 aresas main or baad main gujarat sarkaar main badhati jimmedaariyon ke saath unke jivan main aage badaae kii kahani ko dekhen to modi sirf vyapak nitiyaan banane se hi santusht nahin rahete the
 Like the previous Prime Ministers, they are not going to be satisfied by delegating the responsibility of implementation to the people below them
 ve apane saath aise logon ko rakhte hai jinke andar unki tarah hi kriyanvayan kii kshamta ho, saaf or tay karne laayak lakshya tay karte hai or ‘‘kriyanvayan’’ kii choti-si team taiyaar karte hai
 Instead of announcing the strategy, they get the full details of a project, monitor its day-to-day performance, remove the roadblocks of the people who are executing it, stand by them
 And inspire them
 ve aise logon ko ahmiyat dete hai jo pahal karte hai, jokhim lete hai or un logon ko dandit karte hai jo surakshit rahakar kaam karnaa chaahate hai or afasarshahon kii tarah vyavhaar karte hai
 Also, they do all of this in such a way that from nowhere it seems that they are interfering in things or are very fine-tuned
 isliye ve ek saadhaaran gujarati se bhi bahut asaadhaaran chijen karvaa paae hai
 i first heard Narendra Modi's speech at Shri Ram College of Commerce in Delhi in February 2013 and it came to know about his capabilities
 pradhanmantri pad ke lambey abhiyaan ke tahat yah unka pehla bhaashan tha or isamen unhone apni mahatvakanksha ko sahi tareeke se ghoshit kiya tha
 Unlike Sanchi Rahul Gandhi and the Congress Party, Modi clearly gave the message that he is eager to get this position
 uddeshy ko lekar unki spashtataa bhartiya matadaataaon ke liye nai cheez thi
 Modi was also very clear about his special goal that the BJP has to win an absolute majority
 har baar jab ve isaki baat karte to soshal media main log unki hansi udaate, kai log samajhate the ki ve pagal hai
 They did not know that impossible ambitions led to many successful leaderships
 manager ise ‘‘failaa hua’’ lakshya maanate hai or unka uddeshy hota he ki sainikon ko mushkil lakshya ke aas-paas hi lagaae rakhaa jaae
 Impossible goals are a way to motivate soldiers who have forgotten their different quality
 unhen lagata he ki unke paas ‘‘apana’’ lakshya or ladaai he
 Thus charismatic leaders are known for achieving astonishing sharing of purpose among their colleagues — what the business manager calls an "alignment"
 mahaan netaa bhale log nahin hotemaine narendra modi ke prachaar abhiyaan main ek or visheshta par gaur kiya-ekajute team kii ahmiyat
 Great leaders are not "good" people who have gained popularity and are certainly not the kind of people you can call to a gentle dinner party
 narendra modi ko yah sunishchit karnaa tha ki kaman ekikrut ho or unhen virodhiyon tathaa sanshaywaadee logon se chhutkaaraa paanaa tha
 This can explain why he had to be marginalized by LK Advani, Jaswant Singh and many other leaders
 aakhir kyon unhone apane sabase bharosemand sipahasaalar amit shah ko uttar pradesh main tasviir badalane kaa chamatkaar karne ke liye bheja or kyon party ke bheetar se virodh hone ke baavjood ve bi
 s
 yeddiurppa or ramvilas paswan jaise naapsand, daagi netaaon ko apane saath jode rahe
 The term executive means "one who executes" means executing work
 kisi prabhavi agxcutive kii pahchaan yah hoti he ki vah acchhee planning karata ho or vivaran par dhyaan detaa ho
 i learned this important lesson in Procter & Gamble
 (doosraa sabak yah ki aap ek panne kaa sankshipt memo kaise likhen kyonki likhane ke liye doosraa panna nahin milegaa)
 As i have said earlier, Modi is going to execute things, so he gets the planning and details automatically
 hamane tivi par dekha he ki ve ek shandaar vaktaa hai, lekin parade ke peeche un darjanon kaaryakartaaon kii maheenon kii planning rang laai he jo anushaasan ke saath kaam karte hue ek-ek minute kii taiyaari karte the
 Finally, it can be said that Modi is the same person as all of us who have shortcomings
 unki jagah main hota to 2002 kii ghatnaon ke liye kam se kam ek darjan baar afsos jataa chukaa hota, beshak apane ko jokhim main daale bina
 i would have a powerful think tank with me which would provide me with data especially on economic and foreign policy issues
 main unki or kai kamiyaan gina saktaa hum, par unke sakaaratmak gun nishchit rup se khaamiyon par baari padate hai
 One truth i would like to tell is that Narendra Modi is unknowingly following the advice of British scientist Jacob Bronowski
 unka yah maananaa tha ki duniya ko apekshaaon se nahin balki kaaryon se samajhnaa chahie
 "you do what you think," says Bronowski
 ’’gurcharan das lekhak, tippaneekar or procter and gambal india ke purv siio hai Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi reached Surat on the occasion of completion of one year of demonetisation
 rahul ne yahaan vyapaariyon se mulaakaat kii or notebandi tathaa jiesti ko lekar unki shikaayatein sunin
 During this, talking to the media, he said that five slabs of GST cannot work

 'rahul attacked the BJP, while Union Minister Piyush Goyal has lashed out at this statement of the Congress Vice President regarding GST
 unhone sawalia lahaze main kaha, 'kya rahul chaahate he aam janata par adhik tex kaa boj pade? rahul ko arthvyavastha kii samaj kam he
 Their sensitivity is more towards the rich
 amiron ke liye mahangi chizon par jo tex lagaaya he, usase rahul vyathit hai
 Before Twitter attacked Modi, Rahul Gandhi attacked the Modi government on the anniversary of demonetisation on Wednesday morning
 rahul ne notebandi ko ek traasadee bataaya or twit kiya
 'demonetisation is a tragedy
 ham un lakhon eemaandaar bharatiyon ke saath hai, jinka jivan or jeevika piem ke vichaarheen kadam se barbaad ho gaya
 She also tweeted Shayrana war, along with her tweeted a picture that went viral during demonetisation
 unhone likhaa, 'ek aansu bhi hukumat ke liye khatra he, tumne dekha nahin ankhon kaa samundar hona
 Modi thanked the people Prime Minister Modi also thanked the people by tweeting on the occasion of the note ban anniversary
 unhone 'kaala dhan virodh diwas' ke hashtag ke buudhvaar subah twit kiya, 'kaale dhan or bhrashtachar mitaane ke liye sarkaar kii taraf se uthaae sakht kadamon kaa bad chadhakar samarthan ke liye bharatvasiyon ko main naman karata hum'rahul se pehle hi mil liye amit shahgujrat chunaav se pehle shah or maat kaa khel chal rahaa he

 Its ally, the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), threatened on Tuesday that the Left Front will split if it allies with the Congress

 Considering the discipline, we were silent till now, but it is creating differences among the workers associated with the land in our party
 is gathbandhan kii jarurat unhen samajhane main ham aksham hai
 He did not take any opinion on the alliance with the Congress, he said, not only was Rai not taken from the RSP on this issue, but he was also discouraged for his opinion
 unhone kaha ki hamase is mudde par kabhi bhi paraamarsh nahin liya gaya
 In reality, raising our voice, we were also unable to hear the scolding

 diggaj sunil gavaskar ab un cricketron main shaamil ho jaaenge, jinke naam par cricket stadium hoga
 He will inaugurate this stadium himself
 ab tak sirf mumbai kaa vankhede stadium hi he, jiskaa stand unke naam par rakhaa gaya he
 Talking about the stadium in the name of cricketers, there are only three such stadiums before and all of them are in the West Indies
 viv richards stadium (norkh sound, antiga), bryan lara stadium (taruba, trinidad), derren saimi stadium (saint loosia) ke baad ab sunil gavaskar field hoga
 However, all these stadiums in the West Indies are connected to the cricketers' home town, but Gavaskar's name will not be in his home town, but in Louisville, Kentucky, USA
 times of india se baatcheet main gavaskar ne khushi jataate hue kaha, 'ye bade sammaan kii baat he ki aapke naam waisi jagah cricket stadium hoga, jo us desh kaa pramukh khel nahin he
 The idea of naming the stadium after Gavaskar is that of Jay Boke, a resident of Kentucky, who was associated with the sports marketing company Professional Management Group

 bollywood filmon main to ve ab kam hi najar aate hai magar south filmon main ve kaaphi active rahete hai
 Recently he talked about his career and has shared his experiences about doing stunts in films
 sunil ne ek fire sefti products brands ke launch ke maukey par bataaya, ''main ye soch bhi nahin saktaa tha ki main filmon main itane khatarnaak stants karuunga
 i did this because even after the success of my first film, there were some critics who were quite powerful at that time and they used to call me wooden material
 ve kehete the ki mujhe apane family restraan bijness main waapas chale janaa chahie
 i realized this and i took it as a challenge
 mujhe kuch aisa karne kii jarurat thi jisase main auron se alag dikhuun
 Talking about the stunts done in his first film, the actor said, "I still remember when i did a fire stunt when my first film was released when i was on a bike close to the swimming pool Was sitting on main daraa hua tha kyonki ye sef nahin tha
 But i had to prove myself
 bataa den ki sunil shetty ne kai sari ection films main kaam kiya he
 These include films like Mohra, Border, Dus, Main Hoon Na
 unhone kamedi main bhi haath aajamaaya or saxesphul rahe
 Sunil Shetty's son Ahaan Shetty is also going to debut

 There will be some time in life when you will get success, then there will be some time when you will fail

 As much as the winter of Delhi is famous, as much as summer, but this year in the summer season, Matka Man is also becoming very famous in Delhi
 south dilli kii sadakon par apane mataka vine main 700 litre pani lekar pyaason ke gale ko tar karne vaale is mataka main kii kahani behad dilachasp he
 In Delhi, in order to quench thirst in the hot summer, people have to buy and drink water, in the same Delhi Matka Man works to provide free water to people
 mataka main ke mutabik ye kaam sirf soshal work nahin he balki maanavtaa ke prati unki jimmedaari bhi he
 The 68-year-old 'alag Natarajan', who lives in the magnificent Kothi of Panchsheel Park, a posh colony in South Delhi, is now known as Matkaman
 inke ghar ke baahar bhi nazaaraa auron se alag he
 Not just home, but also the routine of Matka Man is completely different from the people living in the plush chambers
 rojaanaa subah kareeb 5 baje uthakar apni mataka vine gaadi main lagi pani kii tank ko bharna or phir nikal padana south dilli ke kareeb 70 matakon ko bharne
 The purpose of Matka Man's life is now human service
 iaiti profeshnal natarajan kaise bane 'mataka main'?jaruratmand logon ke liye unka maseehaa ban chuke mataka main ne landan main kareeb 32 saal tak ejeeniyar kaa kaam kiya
 In 2004, he was diagnosed with rectal cancer
 cancer ke bare vakt rahete pataa chal gaya tha or vakt par ilaaj bhi ho gaya lekin is ghatana ne soch ko puri tarah se badal diya or mataka main apane parivaar ke saath 2005 main bharat laut aae
 After retiring, Natarajan also worked with several ngos, but her thinking was different from ngo's and then she got the idea to keep water pots in places like IIT, Green Park, Panchsheel and Chirag Delhi and for this Natarajan Modified the van using his engineer mind
 mataka main vine main kareeb 700 litre pani store karte hai
 There is also a separate faucet in the van for people to fill with the bottle to prevent water waste
 pehle natarajan apane ghar se pani bharte the lekin matakon kii sankhya badhane lagi or pani kam padane to unke ek padosi ne madad kaa haath aage badhaayaa
 Now two nearby schools also supply water to Natarajan
 natarajan ko jo roj matakon main pani bharte dekhte hai wo unhen sirhate hai jo nahin jaanate wo bhi khub duaen dete hai
 Matka men who quench thirst also help the needy, saying that drinking water is a work of virtue, but Matka Man does not just drink water but also tries to meet the needs of people
 natarajan sirf pyaason ko pani hi nahin pilaate balki jahaan unhone pani ke matake rakhe vahiin saikil ke tair main hawa bharne vaala pump bhi laga diya he jisase cycle savaar yaa rickshaw chaalak pareshaan na hon
 Natarajan works with his van every day in the morning to fill the masks at 7 places in South Delhi, but the place where Natarajan enjoys the most service is the flyover of Masjid Moth, under which not only water near the police booth Rather, the team of Natarajan, who do not have bells in their cycles, put bells on their bicycles, which reduces the accident and this service is also free
 garmi main jab pyaas se galaa chatak rahaa ho or matake kaa thanda pani mil jaae to wo kisi amrit se kam nahin hota lekin natarajan kii vine se sirf pani nahin balki lassi bhi nikalataa he
 If people agree, sometimes cucumbers, sometimes watermelon and sometimes lemonade are distributed among the matka men for free
 alag natarajan ke is nek kaam main unka saath dene ke liye chaar or log hai jo lassi banane- baantne kaa kaam, ghanti lagane kaa kaam karte hai
 Natarajan gets full support from his wife in this work
 natarajan ke seva bhav ko saraahne waalon kii kami nahin he
 People who see Matka Man helping people every day also hope with prayers that some other people like Natarajan also came forward for humanity

 Input: PTI punjab congress ke netaaon ke liye chandigarh loksabhaa seat (chandigarh Lok Sabha constituency) is samay hot seat ban gai he, jis par chunaav ladane ke liye apni-apni daavedaari thokane kaa silsilaa badhata hi chalaa ja rahaa he
 First of all, Navjot Kaur Sidhu, senior Punjab Congress leader and wife of Punjab cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, has staked her claim to contest from Chandigarh Lok Sabha seat, which has created a stir in the politics of Punjab and Chandigarh
 navjot cor ne shuukravaar shaam ko chandigarh ke congress bhawan pahunchakar chandigarh se loksabhaa chunaav ladane ko congress tikat ke liye chandigarh congress ke adhyaksh pradeep chhabda ko likhit main aavedan diya
 It is to be noted that the area of navjot Kaur and Navjot Sidhu is in Amritsar, from where Navjot Sidhu was a Lok Sabha MP from 2004 to 2014
 yahi nahin unki patni navjot cor lambey samay tak amritsar purv vidhansabha seat se vidhayak bhi rahi
 But currently Amritsar Lok Sabha seat is held by Gurjit Singh Aujla of Congress
 navjot cor kaa kahana he ki 'maine mahila cote se chandigarh ke liye aavedan diya he
 i have come to Chandigarh because of group politics in Punjab
 punjab main captain amarinder, jakhad or bajva group hai
 However i have no problem with them
 siddhu ji punjab main kaam kar hi rahe hai, isliye maine chandigarh se daawa thok diya he
 'former Union Minister Manish Tiwari is the next name among the leaders who have filed a claim for Chandigarh
 manish tiwari 2009 main ludhiana loksabhaa seat se sansad pahunche the
 But he did not contest the Lok Sabha elections in 2014 after which Ravneet Singh Bittu of Congress contested and currently he is a Member of Parliament from Ludhiana
 ravivaar subah manish tiwari chandigarh congress adhyaksh pradeep chhabda se mili or chandigarh loksabhaa seat ke liye apana daawa thok diya
 But the most important thing is that Union Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal has been winning elections from Chandigarh Lok Sabha seat for a long time
 haalanki 2014 main vah yahaan se chunaav haar gaye the lekin is baar phir unhone apni daavedaari pesh kii he
 Pawan Kumar Bansal says that 'anyone can apply to contest elections, but the final decision will be of high command only
 maine chalis saal kaam kiya he
 Water splashes have occurred in the protest landscape
 party dekhegi ki logon se nijee sampark kiskaa acha he' 
 Chandigarh is the shared capital of Punjab and Haryana
 centre shasit pradesh he
 a large number of Congress leaders have entered the fray to contest from Chandigarh Lok Sabha seat, but the thing to note is that this seat is currently with Kiran Kher of BJP
 lekin congress netaaon ko lagata he ki is baar punjab main maahaul unke paksh main he lihaaja chandigarh bhi unke liye anukool hi rahegaa isliye chandigarh loksabhaa seat congress netaaon ke liye hot seat ban gai he

 The incident took place at Chandannagar police station area on Wednesday night
 sabhi hatyaropee faraar bataae gaye hai
 According to police, Sameer was having a love affair with his neighbor Jeevan's sister
 vah saat janvari ko use bhaga le gaya tha
 Life's relatives had filed its report at Chandannagar police station
 agle hi din police ne samir ko giraftaar kar liya tha
 a case was registered under Section 376 of the girl for being a minor
 samir ko 15 din pehle hi jamaanat mili thi
 Additional Superintendent of Police Vinay Pal said on Thursday that Sameer, who was behind the Madina Mosque, was taken by Jeevan and his two friends with excuses
 unhone ganga nagar ke paas chaaku se galaa retkar uski hatya kar di

 On 9 July, when Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president Amit Shah met the party's in-charge of the party's superpower center and Shakti Kendra in Chennai, he was told that "opposition parties are ridiculing the party by saying that in Tamil Nadu Even finding BJP does not help
 ''halki si muskaan ke saath shah ne uttar diya, "yadi vipaksh ko tamilnadu main bhaajapa ko dhundhna he to 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main iviem main dhund le
 There is no doubt that the BJP is going to emerge as a major force in Tamil Nadu in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 ''unhone yah bhi elaan kar diya, "agaami loksabhaa chunaav se pehle ham uchit samay par tamilnadu main gathbandhan kii ghoshnaa karenge
 Whichever alliance it will be with, it will ensure that the state is free from corruption and is on the path of development
 ''shah kaa yah bayaan anayas nahin he
 In fact, he has prepared a blueprint for the future plan by taking full details of the last two Lok Sabha and Assembly elections from Tamil Nadu as well as those states where the party's presence is nominal
 aise rajyon main apane chunavi pradarshan ko prabhavi banane ke liye bhaajapa chote-chote dalon (panjikrut lekin gaiyr manyata praapt) ke saath gathjod kii raah talash rahi he
 The process of contacting such parties has also started
 bhaajapa kii yah ranneeti shah ke us lakshya ke lihaaj se bhi makul he jisamen unhone 2019 main bhaajapa kaa vot pratishat 50 fisadi karne kii baat kii he
 In informal conversations, BJP leaders believe that the ruling party or chief ministers of states like Odisha, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and West Bengal are so strong that it is difficult for the party to succeed in these states in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 vahiin pichley loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ne trikoniya yaa bahukoniya mukaable vaale jin rajyon main shandaar pradarshan kiya tha vahaan bhaajapa virdohi dal lamaband ho rahe hai
 These include the states of Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, Jharkhand Delhi, Haryana and the Northeast
 bhale hi in rajyon ke prabhaavshaalee dal aapas main ek-duusare ke virdohi hai lekin apana astitv bachaane ke liye or pradhanmantri narendra modi ko rokane ke naam par sabhi aapasi matbhed bhulaakar ekajute ho rahe hai
 The brunt of this has been suffered by the BJP in the by-elections held during the last few months
 jin rajyon main bhaajapa kaa sidhaa muqabla congress se he vahaan bhi bhaajapa kii raah 2014 kii tarah aasaan nahin dikh rahi
 For example, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa
 in rajyon main bhaajapa ko bhi sattavirohi rujhaan kaa ehsaas he
 Amit Shah has reiterated this many times, "in states where the party had great success in 2014, there may be a loss of some seats
 is kami kii bharpai ham duusare rajyon se karenge
 In Coromandel State and coastal states, BJP will get good success in 2019
 '' pichley do saal se unhone apni team ko aise 150 siton par kaam karne ke liye lagaaya bhi he, jahaan bhaajapa kii upasthiti nammaatr he
 a senior BJP leader says, "it is true that in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal or Telangana, the party is a force but is not in a position to win the seat alone
 par yah sikke kaa ek pahalu maatr he
 The second aspect of the coin is that the BJP will be in a position to compete with the larger party in these states by joining small allies with them
 '' unka tark he ki tripura main bhaajapa ne aisa hi kiya tha
 By joining the small parties there, the BJP gained majority on its own in the state
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main uttar pradesh main apana dal or phir 2017 ke uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main om prakaash rajbhar kii party ke saath samjhauta karke badi safalataa hasil kii
 BJP strategists believe that there are more than 70 such small parties in the whole country who may not win the elections on their own, but these parties have between 50 thousand and 10 lakh votes
 ye vot loksabhaa chunaav ke lihaaj se dekhne main bhale kam dikhte hon lekin agar bhaajapa ke saath ye dal judate hai to un rajyon main bhi use badi safalataa hasil ho sakati he, jahaan philhal vah kamjor maani jaati he
 Many of these small parties hold good among the farmers
 kuch dalon kii majdoor sanghathanon main to kuch kii aadhyatmik jagat ke logon main apni pahchaan he
 For example, the Peasant and Workers Party of India is a political party associated with the trade union
 iskaa prabhaav maharashtra ke ramgarh, sholapur, nagpur, nanded, nasik ke alaava andhra pradesh ke kuch hisson main bhi he
 This team also has a good work among the students and its student organization called Purogami Yuva Sangathan is also effective
 yah dal vidhansabha main ek-do seat jitati he, lekin loksabhaa chunaav main badi safalataa hasil nahin kar paati
 According to the BJP strategists, if the votes of these parties are transferred to the BJP, then its candidates can win the seats where the BJP loses by 50 thousand to 1 lakh votes
 misaal ke taur par, tamilnadu main tenkasi main bhaajapa ke sahyogi emdmake ne 1,89,386 vot hasil kiya tha or pitipi ne 2,61,757 vot
 If the votes of both are added then it is 26,557 votes more than the 4,24,586 votes won by the victorious AIADMK
 jaahir he, chote dal kai siton par ahm sabit ho sakate hai
 Shah has made it clear that in 2019 the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) will have a bigger clan than the opposition parties
 isliye endie kaa kunba badhaane ke liye anaam odisha party, bahujan mukti party, bahujan vikaas aghadi, bharip bahujan mahasang, gondvanaa ganatantr party, jaibharat samanta party, jai samyak andhra party, loksatta party, manithaneya makkaal kaachi (memke), puthia tamilagam (piti), pyramid party of india, rashtriya samaaj paksh, visike, welfare party of india jaise kai chote-chote dal hai jinhen bhaajapa apane saath jodgaye ke liye kaam kar rahi he
 For this, the Organization Minister of States has been given the responsibility
 har booth par tainaat booth padaadhikariyon ko likhit nirdesh diya gaya he ki ve pichley do loksabhaa or do vidhansabha chunaav ke aankade sanghathan mantri se hasil kar dekhen ki jin boothon par 1,000 se 5,000 voton se party pichad gai thi, us margin ko puraa karne ke liye kis chote dal se talmail karne kii jarurat he
 Why are there small parties Parbhajpa formed an alliance with only a few big parties in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 anya jagahon par chote-chote dal hi endie ke kunbe main shaamil the
 The Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in Andhra Pradesh were with the BJP
 anaupchaarik baatcheet main bhaajapa netaa yah kehete hai ki bade dal par nirbharta adhik rahati he
 It is also more likely to deteriorate
 bhaajapa ke saath yah kai baar ho chukaa he
 For example, the TDP left the BJP recently
 shivasena bhi ghudki de rahi he
 This creates an uncomfortable situation for the BJP
 bhaajapa 2014 se lekar ab tak akele itani majboot ho chuki he ki vah apane dam par bahumat hasil kar chuki he or abhi bhi us sthiti main he
 But smaller parties abound because in the seats where they win and lose by a small margin, the bjp's position will be better by joining with these parties and there will be a possibility of victory
 bihar main pichley chunaav main ram vilaas paswan kii lok janashakti party or upendra kushvaha kii rashtriya lok samta party, uttar pradesh main apana dal, maharashtra main shetakari sanghathan or ramdaas athavle kii arpiai se gathjod kargar sabati hua
 In such a situation, smaller parties can prove to be better allies for the BJP
 bhaajapa ke ek netaa tamilnadu kaa udhaaharan dete hue kehete hai ki pichley loksabhaa chunaav main 39 main se bhaajapa yahaan sirf ek seat hi jeet saki thi
 If this time in the state, the BJP makes alliances with smaller parties like PT, VCK of the state and relatively state parties like MDMK or PMK, then both the major parties in the 10 Lok Sabha seats including Theruvallur, Chennai South, Sriperembudur, Kanchipuram, Arakkonam, The DMK and AIADMK can be bumped up
 bhaajapa ke rajyasabha saansad or media vibhaag ke pramukh anil baluni kehete hai, "pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv main desh ne pichley chaar saal main prabhavi vikaas kiya he
 Given the work and intentions of the Prime Minister, many parties wish to join the NDA
 itnaa tay he ki 2019 main endie kaa kunba 2014 se bhi bada hoga
 Whether the party is small or big, all have their own importance
 bhaajapa sabhi dalon ko baraabar sakvamaan detii he
 "sadhana is not easy
 It is not easy for the BJP to take small parties together
" chote dal is baar apni ahmiyat acchhee tarah se samaj rahe hai
 These parties feel that going with the BJP may get one or two seats, but even after winning the elections, the BJP will benefit
 ek yaa do saansadon ko lekar bhaajapa par dabaav banane kii sthiti main nahin rahenge
 Raju Shetty of the Shetkari organization says, "the things the BJP asks for support later retract
 2014 main ham bhaajapa ke saath kisaanon ke hiton ko lekar gaye the lekin sarkaar banane ke baad kisaanon kii samasya ko lekar hamaari baat ko usne nazarandaaj kar diya or hamen bhaajapa se dur janaa padaa
 At the same time, Dr
 K
 K
, the leader of the PT Party of Tamil Nadu
 krishnasami kaa kahana he, "jo bhi dal hamase gathjod kii baat karne aate hai unhen hamaari ahmiyat kaa pataa he
 But our job is not just to win one or two mps, but it is important to know how much importance they give to our ideology
 yadi sirf sansad main pahunchane kii baat hoti to ham apni alag party kyon banaate, ham congress yaa bhaajapa main hi shaamil ho jate
 Similarly, Prakash Ambedkar, the leader of Maharashtra's Bharip Bahujan Mahasangh, has also been strongly critical of the BJP
 andhra pradesh main adhik sakriy pyramid party ke ek padaadhikari kehete hai, "ham acchhee tarah jaanate hai ki kuch badi partiyaan hamaare sahyog se apana hit sadhana chaahati hai, lekin ve yah baat acchhee tarah se samaj len ki ham kya chaahate hai
 Since vegetarianism, performing arts and spirituality are our core ideologies, we can consider the issue of going with whoever talks about them
 ''congress kii bhi najarchhote dalon kii ahmiyat kaa andaja isi baat se jaahir he ki un par sirf bhaajapa nahin, congress kii bhi najar he
 Randeep Surjewala, the head of the Congress's media department, says, "in the kind of environment in the country, whether a big party or a small one, everyone's rights are being oppressed
 yah baat sabhi mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Therefore, the Congress expects cooperation from all those parties which believe in the plurality of this country
 congress ke liye koi bhi party achhut nahin he
 As far as the alliance and seat sharing is concerned, A
 ke
 The Antony Committee is authorized for this
 vahi is vishay main vichaar karegi
 To protect democracy, it is necessary that all parties, big and small come together
 '' congress ke ek netaa kehete hai, "kai chote dal vaicharik rup se congress ke najadik hai
 Be it the MMK of Tamil Nadu or the Kaumi Ekta Dal of the Hindi belt or the National Samaj Paksha of Maharashtra
 ''vahiin surajevaala bhaajapa par kataaksh karte hue kehete hai, "jis tarah bhaajapa ab har rajya main chote-chote dalon ko saadhane kii jugat main he, usase saaf he ki vah yah maanakar chal rahi he ki kisi bhi rajya main koi bhi badi party uske saath jane ko taiyaar nahin he
 Those who were together have left and are ready to leave some
 ''philhal 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bade dal ek-duusare ko haraane ke liye jis tarah chote dalon ko saadhane main jute hai, usase chote dalon kii ahmiyat badhegi tathaa kai siton par jeet- haar tay karne main bhi inaki bhoomika ahm ho sakati he
 Obviously, local and small issues may not affect the Lok Sabha elections very much, but in the seats where there will be a contest of thorns, their issues with smaller parties can also play a decisive role

 You must have heard this song a lot, but if someone wants to represent lakhs of people and even the curtain is not lifted from his face, what will you say? It is a surprise but in Pakistan's electoral fray a surprise is exactly what he says
 She has been yakeen na ho to is chunavi poster ko dekh lijie
 The neighboring country is currently witnessing a general election stir
 isi chunavi sargarmi ke dauraan chunavi poster-binar se puraa pakistan pata hua he
 But a poster is such that people get confused by seeing it
 kisi bhi raajnneetik party kaa mahila yaa purush ummidavaar kaa reliyon main prachaar karnaa yaa unka cheharaa poster binar main kitna mahatvapurn hota he
 Everyone knows this but have you ever seen that no political party should put the face of its female candidate in the electoral fray? One such picture is going viral on social media nowadays, in which an election poster has a picture of the big male leaders of his political party
 lekin usee poster main unke mahila ummidavaar ke chehre ke badale "bina chehre kii tasviir" lagi hui he
 Just below is his name and a number NA 125 inscribed in Urdu

 Mostly it is being viral on social media by the people of Pakistan
 jaisaa ki agle hafte hi 25 july 2018 ko pakistan main hone vaale aam chunaav ke liye matdaan hone hai
 There are a total of 107 registered political parties in Pakistan
 in partiyon ke kul 3765 ummidavaar neshnal assembly ke in chunaavon main apni kismat aazamaa rahe hai
 Now, when we searched through a picture printed on one of the posters and a number, we came to know that this poster is from tehreek-e-labbaik Pakistan Party's candidate Lahore's candidate Maimuna Hamid
 Women are already invisible in development in Pakistan
 She should not be used as a tool

 Among those 5 women candidates, former Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif's daughter Maryam Nawaz also filed the candidature
 taharik-e-labbac pakistan party ne desh ke kul 278 siton par 180 ummedaaron ko chunavi maidan main utaara he
 But no woman candidate of the party is allowed to campaign in rallies

 Looks just like "picture without face"

 On social media, the people of Pakistan are protesting fiercely about the lack of a woman candidate in this poster

 But this time some fundamentalist and religious organizations are also happening in the country this time, have jumped in the general election
 usee main se yah ek party he "taharik-e-labbac pakistan party"
 It is headed by Khalid Hussain Rizvi, who describes himself as a great scholar on Twitter and maintains a staunch mindset
 pakistan kii news website don ke anusaar, kalid hossain rizvi pehle pakistan ke punjab sarkaar ke rilijiyas afaire department main adhikari rah chuke hai
 As an officer, he used to give his intrusive thoughts and provocative speeches, for which he was dismissed from his job
 (taharik-e-labbac pakistan party ke mukhiya he kalid hossain rizvi )2018 kaa pakistan aam chunaav is baar kai myanon main alag hone vaala he
 But many more political parties with such radical thinking are also in the Chanawi Maidan, one of which is the main party terrorist Hafiz Saeed, who first got his party registered under the banner of "milli Muslim League"
 lekin jab pakistan chunaav ne is par roak laga di to "allaah ho akbar taharik" naamak party ke binar tale saare aatankwaadiyon ko chunaav ke maidan main utaar diya
 With this thinking, such extremist groups are desperate to come to power in Pakistan
 pakistan main duusare raajnneetik dalon ke pramukh mahila netaaon ko star prachaarkon ke rup main bhi rakhaa he
 At the same time, women candidates are also busy campaigning vigorously
 vahiin "taharik-e-labbac pakistan party" ne mahila ummidavaaron kaa cheharaa hi gaayab kar diya he
 Even women candidates cannot participate in the election campaign through rallies
 unke badale taharik-e-labbac pakistan party ke mukhiya hai
 Khalid Hussain Rizvi and other male leaders have taken charge of the election campaign
 ( neshnal assembly 125 se hi pitiai party kii ummidavaar dow

 jahaan duniya itnaa aage nikal gai he
 There in Pakistan, women are used only to fill in the blanks

 a wild elephant was killed in a rail collision in Jalpaiguri, West Bengal
 yah hathi chaparamaari ke jangal se railway trek par aa gaya tha
 After the accident, the injured elephant went down the railway track for about a hundred meter tour and after that it died
 hathi ke sharir par gambhir chot ke nishaan he, lekin railway kisi bhi haadase se inkaar kar rahaa he
 No train driver has given any information about this accident
 is ilaake main junglee haathiyon kii sankhya kaaphi he or aksar unke trek par aa jane kaa khatra rahata he
 For this reason, warning boards have also been installed near the track, but people say that the railway drivers never keep the speed of the train low, due to which such accidents happen
 loksabhaa chunaav hone main kuch hi maheene hi baaki hai
 In such a situation, all political parties have started expanding their respective alliances
 sawaal uthta he ki kya modi sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ke aadhaar par bijepi ko ek baar phir 2014 vaala bahumat milegaa yaa congress 5 saal kaa sookhaa khatm kar satta par kabiz hogi, yaa phir desh kii janata kisi tisare vikalp ko chunegi? in sabhi sawaalon kaa jawaab to chunaav ke baad milegaa
 But before that, Aaj Tak tried to know the mood of the country
 ajtak or karvi incits ke survey main jo aankade saamne aa rahe hai usase bijepi ke liye chintaa bad sakati he
 The results of the survey show that if the PDP, TMC, BSP and Samajwadi Party join the UPA, then the NDA is seeing its loss
 vahiin agar AIADMK or YSRCP endie main shaamil hoti hai to bhi endie ko iskaa phayda nahin milegaa
 With the PDP, TMC, BSP and Samajwadi Party joining the UPA, the UPA is expected to get 44 per cent of the vote
 vahiin endie ko 40 fisadi vot mil saktaa he, jabaki anya ko 16 fisadi vot miltaa dikh rahaa he
 In such a situation, the seats of NDA will also be reduced in this way
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 336 seat hasil karne vaale endie ko 102 siton kaa nuksaan hota dikh rahaa he or vah 234 siton tak simit rah saktaa he
 At the same time, UPA seems to get a bumper advantage
 upie ke khate main 272 siten aane kaa anumaan he to anya ke khate main 37 siten milti dikh rahi hai
 Explain that the parties included in NDA here are BJP, All India n Rangaswamy Congress, Apna Dal, Bodo People's Front, DMDA, JD (U), LJP, Naga People's Front, PMK, National People's Party, RPI (A), Shiromani Akali Dal, Sikkim Democratic Front, Shiv Sena

 Looking at the assembly and Lok Sabha elections, the politics of Congress has come down

 The Congress conspiracy, he said, revealed that during the tenure of the UPA government, the Congress used to act as a fringe of Hindu terrorism and also tried to prove it in court, which was rejected by the court
