 The copy of the Lokpal bill was torn in Rajya Sabha by rjd's Rajnathi Prasad
 lekin ab to bahut kuch badal gaya
 The noise that was once heard in the assemblies has become the stigma of the biggest panchayat of democracy
 13 farvari ko loksabhaa kii kaarywahi shuru hote hi hangaamaa ho gaya
 As soon as the House sat at 11, the issue of Telangana came to dominate the Question Hour
 lihaaja sadan ko baarah baje tak ke liye sthagit kar diya gaya
 As soon as Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde introduced a separate Telangana state bill in the Lok Sabha on Thursday, all mps belonging to Andhra Pradesh became enraged
 tabhi congress se nishkasit saansad el rajagopal ne saansadon ke upar kaali mirch kaa spray chhidak diya
 Now the matter is about to win, so Telugu Desam Party MP Venugopal also joined the sabotage
 venugopal par aarope laga ki ye janaab to chaaku lekar aa gaye the, lekin venugopal ne iskaa khandan kiya
 The ruckus increased so much that at the same time a member started snatching papers on the chair of Speaker Meira Kumar

 At the same time the house was also vacated
 do baje sadan phir se baitha
 But two hours ago, the tension had dissolved into the atmosphere

 It is not known whether TDP MP Venugopal took out the knife or not, but the knife of abuse has been stabbed in the chest of Parliament

 At a time when grains meant rice and wheat, it is a forgotten grain
 yakeen maniye, gahare rang kaa yah motaa anaaj hamaare liye behad phydemand he
 Used in abundance in many states of the country, including Uttarakhand, especially Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and the southern states of India, an alluvial cereal is a whole grain, in which many types of nutrients are found in large quantities
 uttarakhand or bihar ke mithila ilaake samet samooche uttar bharat main iske aate se roti pakaakar daal-sabji ke saath parosa jaataa he
 In South India, it is mostly cooked by making round balls from its flour which is called Ragi Madde or Ragi Sankti in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh
 raagi madde ko sabji sambar yaa daal ke saath khaaya jaataa he
 It is the staple food of the remote countryside of South India
 iske swasthyavardhak gunon ko dekhakar shahari kshetron main bhi ise bade paimaane par log istemaal karne lage hai
 In particular, due to its ruffled properties, people concerned about health are becoming attracted towards it
 madue ko angreji main finger milate bhi kehete hai
 It does not require much water for cultivation
 madua ke phydabacchon main haddiyon kii majbootee ke liye madua samuchit khadyann he
 It contains sufficient amount of calcium and is therefore very beneficial for adults
 madua ke niyamit istemaal se haddiyon main fracture hone kii ashanka kam ho jaati he
 Also, according to experts, it also contains sufficient amount of iron
 isko niyamit khaane waalon ko anemia kii shikaayat bhi nahin hoti
 Due to the low glycemic index in diabetes and marrow's diabetes, the marrow is considered the best food for diabetic patients
 chaaval or gehun kii apeksha isamen ucch str ke fibre tatv paae jate hai
 This makes the starch digestible
 ucch fibrayukt hone ke kaaran iske roti ko namak, sarson tel, hari mirch, achaar, tamaato, kakadi, pyaaj, muuli aadi ke salad saath khaaya janaa chahie or is tarah se yah achaanak badhane vaale blad sugar ko roktaa he
 a slow process of digestion causes the marrow to flow glucose slowly into the blood
 cholesterol or maduamdue main amino acid bhi hota he
 Understand in simple language that there is protein in the marrow
 isse yah anaaj rakt main cholesterol ke str ko ghataata he
 Amino acids are also essential for normal functioning of the body and for the repair of tissues
 madua main aise amino acid bhi paae jate hai jo duusare anaajon main nahin paae jate
 These amino acids are helpful in eliminating excess fat from the body and increase the amount of sulfur in the body
 sulfur sharir main glutathion ke utpaadan main bhi madad karata he jo sharir ke liye prakritik anti-oxident hota he
 Anti-oxidants do not cause wrinkles on the skin and old age does not come quickly
 raktchaap or maduamdue main sodium nahin hota
 For this reason, people suffering from high blood pressure are better than other food grains
 yah sharir ko kudarti taur par aaraam pahunchaata or sharir ko thanda rakhata he
 For high blood pressure, liver problems, cardiac weakness, asthmatic patients and lactating women, roasted peas are the best food
 madue main calcium bhi bharpoor hota he
 So instead of swallowing a tablet of calcium, you should regularly take a marrow key
 yah kanji ek glass pani main ek chammach madue ke aate ko milaane ke baad thodi der ubalkar banaaya jaataa he
 It can be drunk by adding salt and butter
 motaape se pareshaan logon ke liye bhi iskaa seven phydemand hota he

 Was to avoid being disqualified

" rajd kii ore se koun aaenge, yah us party ko tay karnaa he, lekin kisi kaa sonia gandhi yarahul gandhi ke saath koi mudda nahinhai
 Tyagi said, 'nobody has any objection to anyone joining the rally
 champaran raily sabit karegi ki mahagathbandhan ‘barkaraar or kaamyaab’ he

 maharashtra ke kaaryvahak mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis (devendra Fadnavis) par nishaanaa sadhate hue shivasena saansad sanjay raut (sanjay Raut) ne ravivaar ko ek hindi kavita kaa sahaara lekar bhaajapa netaa par nishaanaa saadhaa or unhen raajnneeti ke bade khel main nausikhia bataaya
 There is a fierce confrontation between the BJP and Shiv Sena on the issue of sharing the Chief Minister's post, which has created a deadlock over the formation of government in the state
 49 varshiya fadanvis par nishaanaa sadhate hue raut ne twit kiya, ‘‘jo khandaani rais hai wo mizaaj rakhte hai naram apana, tumhaara lahaza bataa rahaa he, tumhaari daulat nayi nayi he
 Rajya Sabha member Raut had posted a Hindi poem on his Twitter handle last week to target the BJP
 fadanvis ne shuukravaar ko mukhyamantri pad se istipha de diya or haalia vidhansabha chunaav ke baad sarkaar gathan main gatirodh ko lekar sahyogi shivasena ko jimmedaar tehraaya tha
 After resigning, Fadnavis said it was shocking for the BJP that Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray announced soon after the results that "all options are open for the Shiv Sena to form the government"
 ''fadanvis ne 1990 ke dashak main apane raajnneetik kariyar kii shuruyaat kii thi
 He has been representing nagpur-southwest Legislative Assembly since 1999 and has also been the youngest Mayor
 shivasena ne daleel di ki donon partiyon ne loksabhaa chunaav se pehle yah faisla kiya tha ki mukhyamantri pad dhai-dhai saal ke liye saajha hogi
 Fadnavis said that no such decision was taken in his presence
 baad main thakare ne fadanvis ke daawey kaa majbootee se virodh kiya or kaha ki jab tak bhaajapa yah sweekaar nahin karti ki mukhyamantri pad donon sahyogi partiyon main saajha hoga tab tak uske saath koi baatcheet nahin hogi
 Thackeray said that he had promised his father the late Bal Thackeray to become the Shiv Sena Chief Minister in the state which he will fulfill
 rajya main 21 oktober ko hue vidhansabha chunaavon main bhaajapa ne 105 siten, shivasena ne 56, rakanpa ne 54 or congress ne 44 siten jiti hai
 After declaring victory over Syria, US President Donald Trump has also taken a big decision regarding Afghanistan
 america ne afghanistan main maujuud apane kareeb 7000 sainikon ko waapas bulaane kaa aadesh diya he, pentagon jald is faisle ko lagu kar saktaa he
 Let me tell you that Donald Trump had announced a change in Afghanistan policy some time ago and now this decision is kind of surprising
 america sarkaar kaa ye faisla us din aayaa he jab raksha mantri gym mattis ne apane pad se istipha de diya he
 Significantly, the US military has been present in Afghanistan for the last nearly 17 years
 ab america ne faisla kiya he ki vahaan maujuud sabhi 14,000 sainikon ko dhire-dhire bulaane kaa faisla kiya he
 This process will be completed in the next few months
 aapako bataa den ki afghanistan main maujuud ye 14000 sainik vahaan par sthaneey army ko training dene ke alaava ISIS or alqaida ke khilaaf sainya oparation chalaane kaa kaam karte hai
 Significantly, only after assuming the presidency, Donald Trump made a major change in Afghanistan policy
 is dauraan trump ne afgaan niti main bharat ke role ko ahm bataaya tha
 India has been insisting on extending economic cooperation and enhancing relations there beyond the war in Afghanistan
 abhi ek din pehle hi america raashtrapati donald trump ne syria se bhi apane kareeb 2000 sainikon ko bulaane kaa aadesh jari kiya he
 According to the US President, he has won the IS there, which is why the US Army will slowly return from there
 isi faisle se khafa hokar gym mattis ne america raksha mantri pad se istipha diya he
 Afghanistan has been battling the problem of terrorism for a long time, first Al Qaeda, then lashkar-e-taiba and now ISIS are spreading terrorism there
 aapako bataa den ki purv raashtrapati baraak obama ke kaarykaal ke dauraan hi afghanistan se charan dar charan sena ko hataane kaa faisla kiya gaya tha

 After a clip of a telephone conversation between two Aam Aadmi Party mps Bhagwant Mann and Dharamvir Gandhi was leaked, the party alleged that the Narendra Modi government was spying on its mps
 is clip main in donon netaaon ne party netritv se naaraazgi jataai he
 Mann is heard saying to Gandhi in the course of the conversation that he won the election because of his popularity and not because of aap's 'broom' and those who were working against him have been made in charge of the state unit
 
 maan ko kehete suna ja saktaa he, ‘jin logon ne hamaare khilaaf kaam kiya
 Those who regret our victory have been put in charge of us
 ’ baatcheet ko sweekaar karte hue gandhi ne kaha ki maan apane dil se baat kar rahe the
 He said the conversation took place a day before Arvind Kejriwal was sworn in as Chief Minister Path in February
 gandhi ne clip ke li hone main kisi bhoomika se inkaar karte hue kaha, ‘maan ne jo kuch kaha he, vah sahi he
 He has spoken his heart
 ’ gandhi ko pichley maheene party virdohi gatividhiyon ke chalate aap se nilambit kar diya gaya tha
 He said that my phone does not have record facilities
 maan ne sadhi hui pratikriya vyakt karte hue kaha ki unhen kejariwal ke netritv main koi andeh nahin he or vah aap ke nishthavan sipaahi hai
 He told reporters, 'this is the result of dirty politics and is being done to prevent the rise of AAP in Punjab
 ham mul rup se yah kah rahe hai ki agar party kii punjab ikai main gutbaji he to hamen dilli ko suchit karnaa chahie
 The party, however, attacked the Center saying that it had asked its mps to write a letter to the Lok Sabha Speaker about their phone being tapped
 party ne kaha ki baatcheet main maan dwaara uthaae gaye mudde kisi mahatv ke nahin hai
 AAP spokesperson Deepak Bajpai said that the content of the conversation was of no importance
 yah maamuli baaten hai
 But the big thing is how the moves are going against the Center mps
 ayodhya main ram mandir kii pahal na karne se naaraaz rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ne ab centre kii modi sarkaar par sidhe taur par nishaanaa sadhana shuru kar diya he
 The RSS feels that if the Modi government comes to power again, it will not take any initiative to build the temple
 is bare main aresas main number do maane jane vaale sarkarywah bhaiyaji joshi ne guuruuvaar ko prayagraj ke kumbh meley main yojit ek kaarykram main centre kii modi sarkaar par ishaaron-ishaaron main nishaanaa saadhaa or vyangy karte hue kaha ki ram mandir saal 2025 main banegaa
 Bhaiya Ji Joshi said that when the construction of Ram temple starts, the country will start developing rapidly
 is kaarykram main unhone saaf taur par kaha ki ram mandir nirmaan ko lekar ab bhi bahut si chunautiyaan hai, jinase nipatane kii jarurat he
 According to him, Ram temple in Ayodhya is not just the construction of a temple, but it is also associated with the faith and honor of crores of Hindus
 kumbh meley main haridwar kii sanstha divya prem seva mishan dwaara yojit seminar main sangh ke sar kaarywah bhaiya ji joshi ne sirf mandir hi nahin balki vikaas ke mudde par bhi modi sarkaar par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 After the construction of Ram temple, Vikasbhaiya Ji Joshi said that development will gain momentum when Ram temple will be constructed in Ayodhya in 2025
 unhone kaha ki bharat usee tarah teji se aage badhegaa jis tarah 1952 main somnath mandir ke nirmaan ke baad hua tha or jawahar laal nehru piem the
 Bhaiya Ji Joshi also ignored the claims of India walking on the path of becoming a world guru again under Modi rule and satirically said that India will become a world guru after about 150 years
 bhaashan ke baad jab bhaiya ji joshi se is bare main baat kerani chaahi to unhone camere par kuch bhi bolne se manaa kar diya
 In the separate conversation with the camera, he definitely said that everyone on the temple is speaking on his own free will, so he has spoken about his desire to build the temple in 2025
 bhaiya ji joshi ne is kaarykram main hindu samaaj ko jatiyon main bantane par bhi afsos jataayaa or ekajutata par jor diya
 Keeping in mind the sentiments of Hindus, it is worth mentioning that some Sangh leaders have been of the opinion that if BJP has got power then it should have taken the initiative to build the temple
 kyonki logon ne modi sarkaar ko isliye bhi chunaa tha ki unka maananaa tha ki sarkaar hinduon kii bhaawanaaon kaa dhyaan rakhegi
 But the government's priorities changed after coming to power
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apane haalia intervyuu main kaha tha ki court ke faisle ke baad hi sarkaar mandir nirmaan ke bare main koi faisla legi
 After this, the voices of those who raised their voices in favor of the Ram temple have been raised

 Input: from language a post shared by Sapna Choudhary (@sapna_dance_lovers) on Mar 17, 2018 at 1:43am PDTA post shared by Sapna Choudhary (@sapna_dance_lovers) on Apr 16, 2018 at 11:24pm PDT Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to China last year took many years of tense bilateral relations to a new height and President Xi Jinping broke the protocol and received Modi
 lekin daure ke ek maah se bhi kam vakt ke bheetar bhartiya kootneetikon ne china or sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke 14 anya sadasyon ke saamne ek aavedan pesh kiya
 In fact, Pakistani terrorist zaki-ur-rehman Lakhvi was released from Rawalpindi jail, ignoring the restrictions of the Security Council
 iske liye usne baari muchalaka raashi jamaa kii thi
 India's request was to the 1267 Sanctions Committee of the Security Council which lists terrorists and groups belonging to Al Qaeda, the Taliban and now the IS
 anurodh is baat kii jaanch karne ke liye tha ki lakhvi par lage pratibandhon kaa ulanghan kaise hua or pakistan se yah sawaal karne ke liye bhi ki uski rihaai ke liye itani raashi kisne adaa kii
 India has been trying to bring terrorists settled in Pakistan into this list so that their weapons are banned, their movement is banned and most importantly their financial assets are frozen
 ye koshishen pehle bhi chini diwaar se takaraati rahi hai
 According to the old rules of the Security Council, any of its 15 members can put it on a "technical hold" if there is a problem with an application
 aisa na sirf suraksha parishad se baahar ke deshon ko yah soochna die bina kiya ja saktaa tha ki asal main kis desh ne aavedan main adnga lagaaya balki adnga lagane vaale desh ko uski vajah spasht karnaa bhi jaruri nahin tha
 But this was a thing of the past
 yakeenan, bhartiya kootneetikon ne sochaa hoga ki shi ne modi kii abhootpurv agavaani kii thi, uski chamak main sthitiyaan kuch badali hongi
 But it was not so
 antar bas itnaa tha ki china ne aavedan main adnge kii vajah de rakhi thi-unhen or jaankaree chahie
 So, on March 31, 2016, Indian diplomats were not surprised when Beijing put another application listing jaish-e-mohammed chief Masood Azhar on technical hold
 antar is baar bhartiya kheme kii pratikriya main tha
 Within three days, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval & all raised the issue of Azhar in front of Chinese counterparts in meetings in Moscow and Beijing
 khaas taur par dobhaal ne 20 april ko beijing main seemaa vaarta ke 19wein charan ke dauraan china ke sheersh kootnithik yang jhechi ke saamne khare andaaj main baat rakhih beijing ko achche aatankwaadiyon or kharaab aatankwaadiyon ke bich antar karnaa rokna hoga
 Perhaps to prove his point, India first issued an electronic visa to Uygur leader Dolkun Isa so that he could attend the first of its kind meeting of Chinese dissidents and activists in Dharamshala on 28 April
 dolkun 2006 main china ke jhinjiyang kshetra se bhagkar german naagarik ban gaye the
 Beijing says it is the "terrorist" responsible for the 1990 bombings
 par dolkun in aaropon ko khaarij karte hai
 But the visa was rejected on 25 April and the Home Ministry cited Interpol's Red Corner notice as the reason for it which was issued against Issa at the behest of China
 bharat sarkaar par yah aarope laga ki vah china ke dabaav main aakar jhuk gai, par adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki unke saamne or koi vikalp nahin tha kyonki ve red corner notice kii andekhi nahin kar sakate the-taaki kahin baaki desh bhi bharat ke sarvaadhik vaanchit aparaadhiyon ke maamle main isi tarah kaa javaabi kadam uthaane ke liye prerit na hon
 Officials are not ready to publicly confirm whether the visa was issued to ISA with the intention of warning Beijing, but many former diplomats see this as a strong indication that India Has allowed China's dissidents and deportees to gather for the first time
 majboot sathibharat is ummid main he ki vah beijing ko apni niti par punarvichaar karne ko majaboor kar saktaa he, par maujuuda or purv chini adhikariyon tathaa beijing ke samrik visheshgyon ke mutabik isaki gunjaaish bahut kam he
 First, it has close ties with Pakistan, the biggest catalyst for China's move to the United Nations
 uttari korea se rishton main haalia samasyaon ke baad chini samrik visheshgy pakistan ko ab apane desh kaa akelaa asal sahyogi bataate hai
 china-pakistan relations have deepened under Xi's rule
 unhone pakistani kabje vaale kashmir ke raste jhinjiyang se lekar pakistan tak 46 arab dollar ke aarthik coridor kii shuruyaat kii he
 There is a perception in Beijing that Pakistan should be placed at the center of the plan to deal with the growing Islamic threat that China is facing in the western Xinjiang region
 peking vishvavidhyalay main dakshin asia kshetra ke visheshgy haan hua ke mutabik, donon deshon ke bich sahyog acchhee tarah kaam kar rahaa he
 So far, China has a two-pronged approach: in the short term it has been seeking the help of the Pakistan Army and the ISI to attack the Uygur terrorist camps along the pak-afghan border, and in the long run plans to build an economic corridor worth tens of billions of dollars
 use ummid he ki usase jhinjiyang kshetra khulegaa or uigur yuvaaon ko rojgaar milegaa
 While Pakistan has pulled back in tackling the terrorist groups targeting India, China is confident that its military has taken swift and effective steps to crush the anti-china factions and nurtured the camps of the banned East Turk Menistan Islamic Movement

 11 sitambar, 2001 ke hamalon ke turant baad pakistan main niyukt rahe chini rajdoot jhang chunashiyang beijing kii dharna ko pratibimbit karte hai
 They describe the two countries as "iron brothers" and get agitated when they suspect any differences
 jhang kehete hai, “pakistan hi akelaa desh he jisase hamaare majboot rishte rahe hai
 "at a conversation with the media in Beijing late last year when he was asked about terrorist ties between Uygur factions and Pakistani organizations and was asked whether Pakistani agencies were taking adequate steps to control terrorist groups?" So they got angry, "has America put an end to terrorism? And India? This is impossible
 phir kyon aap log sirf pakistan ke bare main sawaal karte ho?” bhartiya khufia agenciyon par pakistan main chini nivesh main adnga lagane kii koshish karne ke pakistani sainya pramukh raahil sharif ke haal ke bayanon ko pratidhwanit karte hue jhang ne aarope lagaaya ki unke kaarykaal main bhi china kii madad se ban rahe guadar bandargah par hamalaa pakistani aatankwaadiyon ne nahin balki ek “videshi takat” ne kiya tha, jiskaa ve naam nahin lenge par uske bare main “har koi jaanata he
 “cooperation for my terrorist vs
 Tumachina also means protecting my partner from international criticism
 2008 tak beijing ne jamaat-ud-daawa ko aatankwaadi suchi main shaamil karne kii bharat kii kam se kam teen koshishon ko roak diya tha
 He changed his decision after going through the anger that spread around the world as a result of the Mumbai attacks
 usee saal beijing ne iesai ke chaar afasaron ko soochibaddh karne ke washington ke prayaas ko bhi roak diya tha
 Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying insists that the technical hold on Azhar is consistent with the "facts" and the "rules and procedures" of the Security Council's sanctions committee
 unka sanket tha ki ye niyam or prakriyaayein, “un donon deshon ke bich samvaad ko protsaahit karte hai jo ek to suchi main shaamil kiye jane kaa anurodh karata he or doosraa, jahaan ve log yaa samooh rahete hai jo suchi ke daayre main rakhe gaye hai
 "in other words, China's message is that it expects India to resolve its issues with Pakistan in a bilateral manner rather than bringing it to the Security Council
 ek purv varisht chini kootnithik ke mutabik suraksha parishad kii paabandiyaan jamini str par kisi bhi samooh par kade kadam uthaane main nishprabhavi hai or beijing ke nazariye main ye keval siyaasi pantarebaaji hai
 According to Indian officials, this argument has no merit
 ve ateet kii un misaalon kii ore ishaara karte hai jahaan antarrashtriya pratibandhon ne kai aditol deshon par karrwai ke liye dabaav daalaa he
 He said that freezing assets also curbs the antics of terrorist groups and their capabilities
 phir bhi, jahaan tak pakistani sanghathanon kii baat he, hakeekat yahi he ki unhen suchi main shaamil kiye jane kaa unke jehadi mansoobon par fark nahin padaa he
 Even after joining the list, the activities of Lashkar and Jaish have continued without any problems
 bharat aatankwaad par prahaar karne ke liye pakistan ko dwipaksheeya samvaad main shaamil kar rahaa he, par antarrashtriya dabaav jutaney main suraksha parishad ek upyogi rasta to dikhaati hi he

 a
 rangachari kehete hai, “iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki aisa anivaary rup se hoga par bharat ke liye ummid yahi he ki antarrashtriya janamat kaa dabaav pakistan ko harakat main aane ke liye majaboor karegaa or isliye yah koshish to hamen kerani hi hogi
 "they say that India needs to adopt a dual strategy
" use lagaataar china ke saath samvaad karke iske liye raji karnaa hoga
 At the same time, to put their point above, they will have to realize that if other countries started playing the same game about who is a terrorist and who is not, and everyone just started working according to their interests then fight terrorism
 The whole world will fail
 kuch rajanyikon ke mutabik, bharat ke liye sabase ahm baat yahi he ki vah suraksha parishad ke un puraane niyamon ko badalane ke liye atake pade sudhaaron ko aage badhaane kii koshish karen jo deshon ko gumnaam vito or manamaane takneekee hold ke peeche chhipane kii gunjaaish dete hai
 Syed Akbaruddin, the permanent Indian representative to the United Nations, argued the same on 15 April
 unhone suraksha parishad kii khuli bahes main kaha, “al kaayda, taliban or iageies par pratibandh samiti kii sarvasammatata tathaa gopneeyata kii prakriya par punarvichaar hona chahie
 "but the authorities believe that until this happens, many terrorists like Azhar will remain beyond the reach of all of us across the Chinese wall

 The BJP executive meeting was held in Meerut for two days for the 2019 Lok Sabha election strategy
 isamen rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah or siem yogi adityanath sahit pradesh ke saare diggaj netaaon ne dastak kii
 But three big faces of BJP did not attend this meeting, which have started raising questions
 kendriya mahila evam bal vikaas mantri menka gandhi, sultanpur se saansad varun gandhi or baharich se saansad savitri bai foole ke nadaarad rahane par siyaasi galiyaaron main sugabugahat tej ho gai
 The political significance of the absence of these leaders is being taken out
 meerut main bijepi pradesh kaaryakarini kii marathon baithak main pradesh ke sabhi vidhayakon or saansadon ne bhaag liya
 The absence of mps from Pilibhit and Minister Maneka Gandhi and his son Varun Gandhi in the Modi government is giving rise to many political speculations
 jabaki baharich kii dalit saansad savitri bai foole ne lagbhag apane bagawati rukh ko saaf kar diya he
 It is believed that Keevarun Gandhi is angry
 isi ke chalate bijepi kii pichhali kai meeting main wo shaamil nahin hue hai
 Varun Gandhi also did not attend the programs of Amit Shah of Rae Bareli and Sultanpur
 bijepi kii baithkon se lagaataar ve khud ko dur rakh rahe hai
 At the same time, Maneka Gandhi's refusal to participate in the state executive of Meerut is pointing towards a new politics
 meerut main hui rajya kaaryakarini ke aakhri din bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne upi ke sabhi vidhayak or saansadon kii baithak ravivaar ko bulaai thi
 All the sitting mps and mlas of the state attended it but Maneka and Varun did not become part of this meeting
 gauratlab he ki ek taraf varun gandhi lagaataar party ke sheersh netritv se naaraaz chal rahe hai
 Before up's 2017 Assembly elections, Maneka Gandhi created political uproar by calling Varun Gandhi a contender for the post of Chief Minister
 isi ke baad party ke kendriya sanghathan ke vistaar ke dauraan varun gandhi ko mahasachiv pad se hataa diya gaya tha
 After this, Varun is running angry
 jabaki duusari ore party bhi varun gandhi se naaraaz hai
 However, despite the resentment, any rhetoric from both sides has been avoided
 vidhansabha chunaav main bhi varun ne khud ko party ke prachaar se alag rakhaa tha
 The BJP also did not pay much attention to him
 iske baad se hi varun gandhi upi main bijepi ke kisi manch par dikhaai nahin die
 Along with Varun Gandhi, is his mother Maneka Gandhi also angry with the party? In such a situation, many questions are being raised due to Maneka Gandhi not joining the state executive of Meerut
 varun ko party main sidline kiye jane ke chalate unke andar bhi naaraazgi he yaa phir koi or vajah?baharich se bijepisansad savitri bai foolebhi party ke bheetar dalit mudde ko lekar bagawati rukh akhriyaar kiye hue hai
 In such a situation, questions are being raised for not attending the Meerut meeting
 haalanki bispi kii ore ve pinge badha bhi rahi hai
 The resentment of these three leaders is not there to take a different route in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 bataa den ki bijepi ne shuru se gandhi parivaar ko gherkar apni siyasat ko aage badhaayaa he
 After the death of Sanjay Gandhi in 1980, Maneka Gandhi became estranged from Indira Gandhi
 aise main menka ne congress se alag apni raah pakadi
 Contested against Rajiv Gandhi from Amethi but could not win
 menka 1988 main wo veepi singh ke janata dal main shaamil ho gayi
 She contested from Pilibhit in 1989 on a Janata Dal ticket and won the Lok Sabha
 1999 main bataur nirdaleey ummidavaar pilibhit se saansad baniin
 Maneka Gandhi then supported Atal Bihari Vajpayee at the center and was also made a minister at the center
 bijepi najaakat ko dekhte hue party ne sateek daanv chalaa
 Maneka Gandhi officially joined the BJP in 2004
 menka 2004, 2009 or 2014 main bijepi ke tikat par saansad pahunchi or mantri bani
 Varun Gandhi also joined the BJP on the lines of Maneka
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main apni maa kii sansadeey seat pilibhit se maidan main utre or jeet hasil karke saansad bane
 After this, in 2014, Varun opted for Sultanpur seat, leaving Pilibhit and became MP for the second time by winning by record votes
 haalanki varun pichley chaar saalon main apane andaaj main kai maukon par modi sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhakar party ko asahaj karte rahe hai
 Investigations started since the Aaj Tak sting of funding from Pakistan to maintain unrest in Jammu and Kashmir

 The picture of the formation of the government in Maharashtra is not clear yet
 The Shiv Sena has already done this in Maharashtra
 Supporting the Congress is a political struggle in Maharashtra for the post of Chief Minister
 shivasena or bijepi apane-apane jid par kaayam he, isi kaa nateeja he ki abhi tak sarkaar gathan nahin ho sakaa
 congress-ncp is trying to understand the political gravity of the occasion and is not opening its cards
 iske baavjood shivasena sharad pavaar kii ensipi or congress ke dam par sarkaar banane kaa dam dikhaa rahi he
 In such a situation, ideologically opposed to each other, the Congress and the Shiv Sena come together, so it should come as no surprise that Balasaheb Thackeray once supported Indira Gandhi
 haalanki ab gend congress ke paale main he
 Please tell that Shiv Sena was founded in 1966 by Balasaheb Thackeray in Mumbai
 shivasena kii chhavi ek kattar congress virdohi dal kii thi
 Balasaheb Thackeray used to target Indira Gandhi a lot in his cartoons
 iske baad bhi shivasena ne congress se haath milaayaa tha
 In 1975, Balasaheb surprised everyone by supporting the Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi
 1977 ke chunaav main bhi balasaheb thakare ne congress ko samarthan kiya tha, lekin shivasena ko ye saport kaaphi baari padaa tha
 The Shiv Sena lost its face in the 1978 assembly elections and the BMC elections
 shivasena ko itnaa bada dhakka laga ki balasaheb ne shivaji park kii ek raily main apana istipha tak ofer kar diya tha
 However, he withdrew his resignation after opposition from Shiv Sainiks
 1975 main apatkaal lagane ke baad vipakshi netaaon ko jail bheja ja rahaa tha
 It is said that the then Chief Minister of Maharashtra Shankarrao Chavan put two options before Balasaheb, either to be arrested like other opposition leaders or to declare his support for the Emergency
 bala sahib ne jail janaa munasib nahin samajha or apatkaal ke paksh main ho gaye
 Even earlier in 1971, Balasaheb had joined with another faction of Congress
 1969 main congress kaa bantwaaraa ho gaya tha
 Indira Gandhi, who was sitting on the post of PM, was expelled from the party by the old Congress leaders
 indira gandhi ke khilaaf khadey in netaaon ke varg ko 'congress ke sindicket' ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 In 1971, Balasaheb shook hands with Congress (O) and fielded three candidates for the Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki ye teenon hi haar gaye
 By the way, it is said that the Congress helped the Shiv Sena to stand up to fight against the communists
 shuruaati dinon main us samay ke mukhyamantri vasantrao nike ke naam par shivasena ko virdohi, vasant sena kehete the
 In 1980, Shiv Sena supported the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections
 balasaheb ne congress ke khilaaf shivasena ke pratyaashee nahin utaare the
 The main reason cited was Balasaheb's personal relationship with the then Chief Minister AR Antulay
 yahi nahin balasaheb ne pratibha patil or pranav mukherjee do congressi ummidavaaron kaa raashtrapati chunaav ke liye samarthan kiya tha
 In the 1984 election, Balasaheb had fielded two candidates of his party on the bjp's election trail
 1989 main bijepi-shivasena ne apana gathbandhan final kiya isamen pramod mahajan kaa bada yogadan tha
 Shiv Sena always played the role of elder brother in this alliance
 1990 ke chunaav main shivasena 288 main se 183 siton par ladi
 The younger allies were given seats by the Shiv Sena from their quota
 1995 main bhi yahi formula kaayam rahaa, jab bijepi-shivasena satta main aae
 This formula was slightly changed in 1999 and 2004
 vajah sunne main ai balasaheb kaa lucky number 9 he
 Shiv Sena contested for 171 seats and BJP 117 seats
 is number main ek maamuli badlaav 2009 ke vidhansabha chunaav main hua, jiske baad shivasena 169 or bijepi 119 seat par ladi
 But the power of Maharashtra remained in the hands of congress-ncp for 15 years
 narendra modi or amit shah ke bijepi main ubhaar ke baad bhagava dalon kaa sameekaran badal gaya
 The Shiv sena-bjp alliance broke up in the 2014 assembly elections, both contested separately
 shivasena ko sirf 63 or bijepi ko 122 siten milin
 However, after the election, Shiv Sena and BJP formed a government together
 2019 main bijepi 164 or shivasena 124 siton par chunaav ladi
 During this time it was said that a formula has been fixed for equal sharing of power
 par ye sikret formula he kya, naa to bijepi or naa hi shivasena ne iskaa khulaasa kiya
 Now the Shiv Sena is saying that there has been talk of two-and-a-half-year division of the Chief Minister's post, while the BJP is denying it
 maharashtra main jo is samay ho rahaa he wo shaayad bharat main pehle kabhi nahin hua
 When there is no majority, political parties somehow try to form a government by manipulating other parties, no matter how different they are from each other in the level of ideology, there have been many big opponents of each other, but here the allies fought each other
 Has happened

 The spiritual guru Asaram Bapu, who is accused of raping a minor in the ashram, is beginning to tighten the law

 The statement of the victim's brother has also been recorded

 In Chhindwara, the police questioned the staff of the ashram and students studying there
 vahiin peedit se poochtacha main ye sachai saamne ai he ki peedit ladki asaram ke paas nahin janaa chaahati thi lekin uske mata-pita ne asaram kii andhbhakti main jabaran use ashram bheja tha
 On the other hand, Asaram Bapu has once again said that he is innocent and he is being falsely accused under the conspiracy
 indore main asaram ne media par jamkar apni bhadaas nikaali
 Asaram, however, admitted that he knew the victim and that he was like his granddaughter
 asaram ne kaha ki jab un jaise hasti par jhuthe aarope lagate hai to samajha ja saktaa he ki samaaj main kitne logon par jhuthe cese chalate honge
 On the other hand, in Chhindwara, Dharma Sena workers burnt Bapu's effigy in front of Asaram's ashram, the same Bharatiya Gondwana Party submitted a memorandum to close the ashram
 jabaki indore main asaram kii tulana sikh guru gurunanak dev se kiye jane par sikh samaaj aag babula ho gaya
 The Sikh community fiercely shouted slogans against the ashram in Indore, and blamed the abuses on Asaram's poster

 mayawati ne apane aadhikarik twitor acount par twit karte hue congress par nishaanaa saadhaa or likhaa, ''congress party ne pehle rajasthan main bispi vidhayakon ko todaa or ab movement ko aghaat pahunchane ke liye vahaan varisht logon par hamalaa karvaa rahi he jo ati-nindaneey va sharmnaak he
 The Congress is throwing a very wrong tradition against the Ambedkarite movement, to which people can give titular answers
 ''2
 Therefore, the Congress Party should desist from such disgusting antics
 mayawati ne apane duusare twit main congress ko chetavanee dete hue likhaa, ''atah congress party ko apni aisi ghinauni harkaton se baaj aa janaa chahie
 Last month too, he warned the Congress through his tweet
 unhone twit kiya tha ki congress party kii doshali niti kii vajah se hi desh main sampradayik takatein majboot ho rahi he kyonki congress party sampradayik takaton ko kamjor karne ke bajaay, iske viruddh aawaaj uthaane vaali takaton ko hi kamjor karne main lagi he
 The public should be careful
 gauratlab he ki pichley maheene sitambar ke madhya main rajasthan main bahujan samaajawaadee party ke sabhi chah vidhayak congress main shaamil ho gaye the

 Let me tell you, the BSP supremo Mayawati had reacted sharply when the mlas joined the Congress, terming the Congress as trustworthy and fraudulent

 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne jab duniya ke saamne rakhaa ki bharat main bhi jika virus ke cese saamne aae hai to swaabhaavik rup se sansani fail gai
 But this information was already in front of the state administration and according to the administration, now its danger has been eliminated
 aadhikarik jaankaree ke mutabik sabase pehle pichley saal navambar main 34 saal kii ek garbhvatee mahila civil aspataal main daakhil kii gai thi
 When he got fever, samples were naturally sent to check his blood
 lekin uskaa sample chikangunia or dengue ke liye negative paaya gaya
 On further investigation, the first report came on January 4, confirming that he had the zika virus
 gujarat ke ahmedabad main teen jika virus ke conform cese saamne aae the
 All these cases came up in January this year
 positive paae gaye marizon main do garbhvatee mahilaayein bhi thim
 About 1 in the Bapunagar area of ahmedabad after the Zika virus cases were revealed
 25 lakh logon kaa survey karke unka swasthya parikshan kiya gaya tha lekin anya kisi main bhi jika virus nahin paaya gaya tha
 The administration says that there is no fear anymore
 sabhi log rogamukt ho gayi hai or saamaanya zindagi ji rahe hai
 Gujarat Chief Secretary JN Singh said that he did not want to spread fear and that he had good doctors for treatment and adequate machinery for examination so it was investigated and the diseased people were treated
 tippaniyan Generally, the woman with Zika virus is likely to have an impact on the child's health
 lekin in donon hi maamalon main bachche saamaanya rup se swasth rahe the
 The zika virus is spread by the mosquito and its symptoms are similar to those of dengue and chikungunya
 jisamen bukhaar aana, jodon main dard, ankhen laal ho janaa auki sharir par laal nishaan ho janaa vagairah hote hai
 So far the disease has been seen in 67 countries of the world, although these are the first cases in India
 doctorl ke vyavsaay se jude log kah rahe hai ki agar rajya sarkaar ne samay rahete aagaah kiya hota to doctoron or logon main bachaav ko lekar zyada satarkta rahati
 Former President of Ahmedabad Medical Association, Dr

 By the way, there are old issues and all these have become healthy, now there is no danger
 lekin aas-paas machharon kii utpatti rokkar ilaaj se bachaav hi acha he kii niti aam logon auki prashasan donon ko hi apnaani chahie
 The state government should also not hide, but it is also important to increase vigilance among the people

 aam taur par jika virus se grast mahila ke bachche ke swasthya par asar hone kii sambhaavna hoti he
 But in both these cases the children were generally healthy
 jika virus machhar se failata he or iske lakshan dengue or chikangunia kii tarah hi hote hai
 Which include fever, joint pain, red eyes and red marks on the body, etc
 ab tak duniya ke 67 deshon main ye rog dekha gaya he, bharat main haalanki ye pehle maamle hai
 People associated with the medical profession are saying that if the state government had warned in time, doctors and people would have been more vigilant about rescue
 ahmedabad medical association ke purv adhyaksh dow
 Pragnesh Vachrajani says that if the state government had made its information public, it would have been better and doctors would have been more alert and more careful
 vaise to puraane maamle hai auki ye sabhi swasth ho gayi hai ab koi khatra bhi nahin he
 But it is good to avoid the treatment of mosquitoes around the origin and that both the common people and the administration should adopt the policy
 rajya sarkaar bhi chupaaye nahin lekin logon main satarkta badhaaye ye bhi jaruri he

 prashnkaal main congress netaa anand sharma ne is masale ko uthaate hue kaha ki congress party ko iske bare main pataa hi nahin tha or chunaav ayog ne notification ke dauraan aisi koi zikr nahin kiya
 This led to the adjournment of the house twice

 There is indirect voting, there is no direct voting, in this you will give your preference

 If the Election Commission has decided, then it must have been thoughtful

 Explain that the Supreme Court had said in the election of PUCL that you should be given notice in direct voting
 yah to ellection kamishan kaa apana faisla he
 The Election Commission did not take it through the Supreme Court

 Virat Kohli, the captain of the Indian cricket team, looked a little disappointed after the loss in the match

 If their disappointment is seen, the score is cleared from the card itself
 bhartiya team england ke kilaaf test series ke lords main khele gaye duusare match main chauthe din hi ghutane tech baithi
 After the match, Virat admitted that due to the circumstances, there was a huge mistake in the selection of the last 11 players

 Captain Kohli said, 'it was not possible to guess the weather

 We have a chance to rectify this mistake in the next match
 'match main bhartiya team ke pradarshan ko lekar niraashaa jaahir karte hue kohli ne kaha ki unhone aisa pradarshan nahin kiya jis par garv kiya ja sake
 He praised the hard work of the England team and said that with hard work, England took the right decisions during the match and showed commitment which led them to victory
 match khatm hone ke baad kohli ne kaha, 'hamane khel main jo pradarshan kiya us par garv nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 For the first time in the last five Test matches, we have not played better

 However, Kohli also said that poor batting cannot be held responsible for the defeat
 unhone kaha, 'jab aap khel khel rahe hon to vastav main sthitiyon ke bare main nahin soch sakate hai
 You cannot sit and follow about these things
 kai baar gend aapaki man chaahi disha main nahin jaati he
 "I will be fine in five days"
 However, let me tell you that Kohli batted with back pain in the second Test match played against England on Sunday, but he has expressed confidence that he will complete before the next match in Nottingham from 18 August
 Will fit like this
 kohli ne duusari pari main 29 gendon main maatr 17 ran banaae
 Shortly before tea break, Stuart Broad got Kohli caught by Oliver Pope at short leg with a bouncing ball

 This has happened due to more workload and more matches played by me
 ' unhone kaha, 'abhi paanch din hai
 i am sure i will be fine in five days
 'gauratlab he ki england ne team india ko lords main khele gaye duusare test match main pari or 159 ranon se maat de di he

 During the election rhetoric Kalyan Singh had said that if his party got less than one seat in Uttar Pradesh from 221 (then it had the same number of seats), then it would be a sign of denial of the temple movement
 babari masjid giraae jane ke baad 1993 main hue chunaav main rajya main unki party ko ek nahin balki 44 siten kam milin
 Finally, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) got 176 seats, which was just one less than the BJP
 lekin uske baad se desh or khaskar pradesh kii raajnneeti hameshaa ke liye badal gai
 The movement of "kamandal", which unites "hindu society" as a division of Mandal, has completed its life like other movements
 mandir andolan kii ridh banane vaale samudaay apane-apane siyaasi phaayde ke liye usase katate chale gaye
 Political awareness has made Mayawati of BSP the only leader in the state who can transfer votes of Dalits to anyone
 tiraskrit ‘‘mullah’’ mulaayam singh yadav apni jati ke saath hi puure haq ke saath musalamaanon ke netaa ban gaye
 With the change of the largest communities of the state, the forward castes joined the BJP for their political existence
 nateezaah chaar dashak tak rajya main dalit, musalmaan or brahmanon kaa netritv karne vaali congress 1989 ke baad se ab tak satta se dur he
 The BJP, which sparked politics through the temple movement, could not rule for a total of five years in the state twice after the mosque demolition but reached the center
 ab rajya main ek dashak se zyada samay se satta se dur is party ko lagata he ki dilli ke takht kaa rasta ayodhya se hi hokar jaataa he
 On 31 January this year, when senior bjp-sangh-vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leaders gathered at the house of MP Shripad Yesso Naik in Delhi, it was decided that the BJP would take forward the issue of development and good governance, then the VHP Ram Mandir movement was again Will create polarization outlines
 vahiin tay hua tha ki viechpi sadhu-santon ko lekar andolan karegi or bijepi-sangh use rajnatik samarthan degaa
 But considering the possibility of a Third Front, Mulayam also does not want to miss a chance
 ‘‘netaji’’ ne 17 agast ko dopaher viechpi ke netaaon se mulaakaat ke dauraan unki 84 kosi parikrama kii baat ko narmi se suna
 He called the convenor of Babri Masjid Action Committee and Additional advocate-general of the state Zafaryab Jilani on the same evening to discuss the bungalow at 5, Vikramaditya Marg
 jilani ne 84 kosi parikrama shuru karne kii muhim ke sandarbh main apni baat teen binduon main rakhih jo yatra bijepi or congress ke shasankaal main nahin hui use achaanak sapa kii sarkaar ke samay karne kaa auchity kya he? yatra kaa matlab siyaasi he or yah supreme court ke adeshon kaa sidhaa ulanghan hoga
 In the end, Jilani argued that if Mulayam allowed the visit, he would be responsible for its results too
 agle din jab sapa sarkaar ke cabinet mantri ajam khan ne viechpi netaaon khilaaf apana morcha kholaa to mulaayam ne apni party kii sarkaar ko viechpi kii prastaavit parikrama par pratibandh lagane kaa ishaara kar diya
 In this way, Krishna and Hanuman Bhakta "netaji", while taking a soft stand in front of the VHP leaders, tried to keep Muslim supporters honest and introduced practical politics
 mandir-masjid mudde ko bijepi or sapa ke bich baantkar mulaayam ne philhal ek hi jatke main congress ko pradesh kii raajnneeti ke hashie par pahunchaa diya
 Recently, the government, which suspended SDM Durga Shakti Nagpal, accused of "demolishing" the mosque wall in Kadalpur village in Noida, has left no stone unturned to woo traditional Muslim voters
 lekin mulaayam jaanate hai ki ab sirf masjid bachaane ke naam par hi musalamaanon kaa vot hasil nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Hence, within 24 hours of the ban on 84 Kosi Parikrama of saints starting from Ayodhya on 25 August, the SP government in 85 welfare schemes of 30 government departments of the state included minorities - Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Parsis and Jain communities
 - By determining the 20 percent stake, before the Lok Sabha elections, another big bet was made to woo the Muslims
 rajya main alpsankhyakon kii 19
 Muslims constitute 18% of the population of 18
 5 fisadi he
 The mobilization of SP among Muslims has also given an opportunity for the BJP to take back its lost land in UP during the last one and a half decades
 is avasar ko puri tarah bhunaane ke liye sabase pehle bijepi ne ram mandir andolan ke nayak banakar ubhare purv mukhyamantri kalyaan singh ko party main waapas laakar hindutv ke agenda main dhar dene kii koshish kii
 Not only this, in the next Lok Sabha elections, the BJP along with three Fire Brand leaders Uma Bharti, Varun Gandhi and Yogi Adityanath have prepared to move secretly on the agenda of Hindutva across the state
 itnaa hi nahin, adityanath kii sangrakshakatv vaali hindu yuva vahini pehali baar pashchimi jilon main apana vistaar kar rahi he
 Adityanath's plan to make the abridged Shiva temple built in the Muslim-dominated area in Jhansi and to get the Muslims out of the premises worked to a great extent
 21 june ko meerut or do maheene baad 21 agast ko gajiabad main baithak kar adityanath ne in jilon main hindu yuva vahini ke sanghathan ko antim rup diya
 State President of Yuva Vahini Raghavendra Pratap Singh says, "our organization is reactionary
 jis tarah se pradesh kii sapa sarkaar muslim tushtikaran or voton ke dhravikaran kaa prayaas kar rahi he usase nipatane ke liye yuva vahini kaa vistaar pashchimi jilon or bundelkhand main karnaa aavashyak ho gaya tha
 But both Congress and BSP consider the 84 Kosi Parikrama issue as a connivance with the SP and the BJP
 pradesh congress ke adhyaksh or faijabad se saansad nirmal khatri poochhate hai, ‘‘jab sapa kii sarkaar aati he tabhi viechpi aise andolanon kii ghoshnaa kyon karti he?’’ bispi ne gaanv se lekar block str tak choti goshtiyon kaa aayojan kar sapa or bijepi kii mileebhagat ke bare main janata ko jaagruk karne kii ranneeti banaai he
 BSP national general secretary Nasimuddin Siddiqui says, "muslims have suffered the most since the formation of the SP government in the state
" dangon kaa bhay dikhaakar sapa ek baar phir musalamaanon ko gumraah karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 "SP may have started giving economic incentives in view of this, but BJP is still engaged only in heating up the Hindutva issue in the state
" bhale hi ‘‘jidipi 5 fisadi pahunne, bisisiai main daalamia, infosis main murti, pakistan main navaj sharif, bollywood main maadhuri dikshit or jail main sanjay dutt kii vaapasi se ’90 ke dashak kii vaapasi kaa abhas ho rahaa ho’’ lekin is dauraan sarayu main kaaphi pani bah chukaa he

 Rajeev Dhawan said that Nirmohi Akhade says that he is Shebet and deprived of the right to manage
 agar koi nayaa mandir ban jaataa he to nirmohi akhaada uskaa shebet rahegaa
 Dhawan said that the trial of Mahant Raghubar Das in 1885 was first rejected by the Nirmohi Akhara but later accepted the Mahanta of Nirmohi Akhara
 pehle nirmohi akhaada ne janmasthan shabd ko nakaar diya tha lekin baad main isko jeudicial intry main mana
 Rajiv Dhawan, on the question of the place being called a juristic person, said that the Hindu side has argued that prayers are offered for rivers, mountains, wells

 As far as the Vedas are concerned, they worship it, but not in this form
 aap surya se prarthana karte hai, lekin ise apana adhikaar kshetra nahin kehete
 Dhawan said that the concept of a self-proclaimed being is that God reflects himself, like a mountain or a Manasarovar, this does not prove that such a self-proclaimed God forms the juristic personality
