 com / Consumers in India are going to get big power soon
 buudhvaar kii shaam cabinet ne nae kanjumar protection bill ko manjuuri de di
 The bill contains stringent measures to deal with consumer complaints as well as to combat misleading publicity
 kaaphi samay se sansad main lataka tha bilanaya kanjumar protection bill kaaphi samay se sansad main lataka hua tha or ise agast 2015 main hi centre sarkaar ne loksabhaa main pesh kiya tha
 After that the bill went to Standingkamitke
 standing kamity ne pichley saal april main hi apni report de di thi
 But the Standing Committee had suggested in its report to make so many changes in the bill that the ministry thought it better to bring the bill afresh
 upabhaktaaon ke hiton kaa rakhaa gaya dhyanbuudhvaar ko cabinet main nae bill ko manjuuri de di gai he
 Therefore, the government will now withdraw the bill introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2015 and present this new bill in its place in the same session
 nae bill main is baat ke intjaam kiye gaye hai ki upabhoktaaon ko apni shikayaton ke niptaare ke liye idhar se udhar dhakka naa khaanaa pade
 The bill provides for the creation of a Central Consumer Protection Authority that will work to protect the interests of consumers
 bhraamak prachaar karne vaale bhi napengehi nahin kanjumar protection bill main bhraamak prachaar se nipatane kaa bhi praavdhaan kiya gaya he or jo celibrity log bina dekhe samajhe kisi saamaan ke bare main jhootha daawa karenge unke khilaaf bhi karrwai kaa intjaam he
 The new consumer protection bill also provides for better handling of customer fraud and purchase complaints in the case of online shopping
 sheetakaaleen satr main bill paas karaane kii koshishhal main hipradhanmantri narendra modi ne ek sammelan menkaha tha ki upabhoktaaon ke hiton kii raksha ke liye nayaa kanoon laana is sarkaar kii praathamikta he
 It is believed that the government will pass this bill in this winter session and try to give it a legal form
 hindu panchang ke anusaar karthik maas kii teras yani ki 13wein din dhanteras (dhanteras) manaaya jaataa he
 It is from Dhanteras that the Diwali festival begins
 is din yani ki dhanteras ko bhagwaan dhanvantari (dhanvantri) ke saath hi dhan kii devi maa lakshmi (maa Lakshmi) kii puja kaa bhi vidhaan he
 It is believed that on the day of Dhanteras, Lakshmi Puja is removed from poverty and the house becomes full of wealth
 dhanteras ke din yatha shakti deepawali (deepawali) kii khariddaari kii jaati he or isi saamaan ke saath lakshmi-ganesh kii pratimaa laana shubh mana jaataa he
 It is believed that on the day of Dhanteras, not only the idol of lakshmi-ganesh should be brought, but it should also be accompanied by sweets
 saath hi khil-bataashe bhi kharidne chahie
 Lakshmi could not keep up with her and as the Lord moved forward, Lakshmi too followed
 kuch hi aage jane par unhen sarson kaa ek khet dikhaai diya jisamen khub phool lage the
 Seeing the beauty of mustard, she was enchanted and went ahead after plucking flowers and doing her makeup
 aage jane par ek ganne ke khet se lakshmi ji ganne todakar ras chusane lageen
 At that moment, Vishnu came and seeing this, angry at Lakshmi ji, cursing him, said, 'I did not forbid you to come here, but you did not listen and committed the crime of theft in the farmer's field
 ab tum is aparaadh ke jurm main is kisaan kii 12 varsh tak seva karo
 Saying this, God left them and went to Kshirsagar
 tab lakshmi ji us garib kisaan ke ghar rahane lageen
 One day Lakshmiji said to the wife of that farmer, 'you bathe and worship this Goddess Lakshmi made by me, then cook the kitchen, then you will get what you ask for
 ' kisaan kii patni ne aisa hi kiya
 Due to the effects of worship and the blessings of Lakshmi, the farmer's house was filled with food, money, gems, gold etc
 from the second day itself
 lakshmi ne kisaan ko dhan-dhaany se purna kar diya
 The farmer's 12 years were blissfully cut
 phir 12 varsh ke baad lakshmi jane ke liye taiyaar huin
 When Vishnu came to take Laxmiji, the farmer refused to send him
 tab bhagwaan ne kisaan se kaha, 'inhen koun jane detaa he ,yah to chanchala hai, kahin nahin thaharatin
 Could not stop them very big
 inako meraa shaap tha isliye 12 varsh se tumhaari seva kar rahi thim
 Your 12 years of service have been completed
 ' kisaan hathpurvak bolaa, 'nahin! ab main lakshmi ko nahin jane duungaa
 Then Laxmiji said, 'O farmer! If you want to stop me then do what i say
 kal teras he
 You must clean the house tomorrow by leaping
 raatri main ghi kaa deepak jalaakar rakhana or siankal meraa pujan karnaa or ek tambe ke kalash main rupee bharkar mere liye rakhana, main us kalash main nivas karongi
 But i will not show you at the time of worship
 'lakshmi ji ne aage kaha, 'is ek din kii puja se varsh bhar main tumhaare ghar se nahin jaaoongi
 Saying this she spread in ten directions with the light of lamps

 Sanjay Singh has said in his tweet that also take care of the sentiments of activists who demanded the removal of Kejriwal from the post of Convenor
 udhar, prashanth bhushan ne apni chitthee main kejariwal par hamalaa bolaa he
 He has questioned the way the party functions and said that the party is becoming one-man centric
 isse pehle ravivaar kii dopaharaam aadmi partiki rashtriya kaaryakarini main yogendra yadav ko party se hataane kii maang uthi
 Five evidence has been kept against him in the party forum demanding the removal of Yogendra Yadav from the party
 rashtriya kaaryakarini ko likhi apni chitthee main prashanth bhushan ne kaha he ki party main aatanrik loktantr to he, lekin swaraj nahin he
 He has also called for an Ethics Committee to examine the party fund, questioning the way the party functions
 bhushan ne apane patr main rashtriya kaaryakarini or piesi kii baithken niyamit taur par naa hone kaa aarope lagaaya he
 It is worth mentioning that earlier, the internal Lokpal of the party, Admiral Ramdas, wrote a letter to the High Command, describing the lack of internal democracy in the Aam Aadmi Party
 iske saath hi admiral ne kai mahatvapurn sawaal uthaae he
 The Admiral has raised the question in his letter that why is the Chief Minister of Delhi and the convener of the party the same person? The party's Lokpal in its letter has also talked about restructuring of committees like PAC and NAC
 admiral ne kaha ki party netaaon main aapasi vishwaas kii kami he
 On the absence of a single woman in the Delhi cabinet, Admiral Ramdas said that the party has become a boys club
 gauratlab he ki shanivaar ko aam aadmi party sanghathan main bade badlaav ke sanket mili the
 In these signs, there was also news of the removal of Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan from the PAC
 sutron ke mutabik party ke kai netaa yogendra yadav ke taur tareekon se naaraaz he
 The meeting of the party's executive meeting held on 26 February had also brought the news of the heat
 haalanki party ne in khabaron ko niraadhaar bataaya he
 It has not been even a month since the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi, but before that the party has started to feel the pain of some old wounds
 jeet ke jashn main jo sawaal dafan ho jane chahie, wo surasa kii tarah saamne khadey ho gaye hai
 The fire of the internal quarrel of the Aam Aadmi Party has provoked how the VP House room number-544, on Sunday afternoon, when the whole of Delhi was getting wet due to unseasonal rains and the Delhiites were confined in their houses
 Aam Aadmi Party's damage control was going on inside these closed doors
 pro
 Anand Kumar, Prashant Bhushan and Pankaj Gupta were facing many questions
 bada sawaal yahi tha ki party ke bheetar asantosh se kaise nipta jaae
 Delhi's power has come into its hands, but various doubts and concerns have started coming up regarding the functioning of AAP as a political party
 sawaalon kii ek badi si fehrist party ke lokapal admiral ramdos kii ore se bhi jari ho chuki he
 Prashant Bhushan came out of the middle meeting on Sunday and called the meeting informal, but the news is that among the leaders who have created a panic in the party, one is Prashant Bhushan and the other party's intellectual face Yogendra Yadav
 is vakt aam aadmi partimen bhadke jhagade kaa ye alam he ki yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan donon kii piessi kii sadsyta zyaadaatar sadasyon ko khatakane lagi he
 In the presence of Yogendra Yadav at the National Executive meeting on 26 February, sharp questions were raised on him
 sarkaar banane ke baad party ke zyaadaatar netaaon ko yogendra yadav ke ateet ke kai kadam khatakane lage hai
 These leaders allege that Yogendra Yadav harassed the Haryana unit
 doosraa kejariwal ke khilaaf galat khabaren chalavaain or teesraa yah ki dilli chunaav se pehle kejariwal ko dhamkee di
 Fourth, by threatening to leave the party, they kept getting their terms, and fifthly, they continued to work to demoralize the party workers
 ye mahaj aarope hai, kitna sach or kitna thos hai, ye tay karnaa mushkil he, lekin jahaan tak piesi main badlaav kaa sawaal he, to is par party netaa camere ke saamne alag-alag raay de rahe hai
 However, the resentment is not just about Yogendra Yadav or Prashant Bhushan
 party ke lokapal admiral ramdaas ne party par kejariwal ke varchasv par bhi sawaal uthaa diya he
 Significantly, after the historic victory in Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal gave such a statement that many leaders of the party got into trouble
 un netaaon main se ek yogendra yadav bhi hai kyonki dilli ke daayre se ek nai-naveli party ko baahar le jane kii mahatvakankshi yojana ke samarthak wo bhi the
 Now Yogendra Yadav is the target within the party, so the question is also arising that what Arvind Kejriwal himself wants
 sawaal sirf yogendra yadavaya prashanth bhushan par hi nahin uth rahe
 The entire party is in the question, its way of functioning
 party ke lokapal ke sadsy admiral ramdos ne kejariwal ko lambii-chaudee chitthee likhakar ek tarah se aainaa dikhaa diya he
 Admiral Ramdas has raised a few serious and disturbing questions
 ramdaas ne jo sawaal ve hai -1
 Why not the party's national convener? 2
 party main kyon nahin sah-sanyojak banaaya jaae?3
 Why not internal democracy in the party? 4
 kaaryakartaaon ko nazarandaaj kyon kiya ja rahaa?5
 Why not a single woman in the cabinet? 6
 party ke bheetar avishvaas kaa maahaul kyon?7
 Why not the restructuring of the pac-executive? The dissatisfaction within the Aam Aadmi Party has been there for a long time, but the reality has also come to light as Ramdoss's letter went public
 aam aadmi party ke bade chehron par chintaa kii lakeeren saaf-saaf dikhne lagi hai
 By the way, it is also news that Kejriwal himself has sought freedom from the responsibility of the post of convener
 ye kaha he ki wo mukhyamantri kii bhoomika par hi puri takat or puraa tajurba lagaana chaahate
 But the party is not ready
 kyonki ye sach, to sabko maaloom he ki aam aadmi party kaa matlab sirf or sirf kejariwal he

 During the first royal bath of Mahakumbh, these adornments of Naga sadhus were indeed seen beating women
 pehle shahi snaan ke dauraan vibhinn akhaadon ke naga saadhuon ke vibhinn rup dekhne ko mili
 Shravan, a Naga saint associated with Juna Akhara, said during the Baitichat, “we adorn more than women

 " akhaadon main naga sadhu bhi alag-alag tarah ke hote hai
 Some are soft-hearted, some are rude

 Even after five years in Chhattisgarh, the reality of the Jhiram Valley massacre has not been revealed, the Congress government of the state has strongly objected
 chhattisgarh sarkaar ko is maamle main NIA kii puri report kaa intjaar he
 For this, the government has written a letter to the NIA demanding full details of the incident and the return of the case so that the SIT investigation can begin soon
 bataa den ki 25 may 2013 ko bastar ke jheram ghati main naksaliyon ne congress kii parivartan yatra par tabadatod hamalaa kar 35 netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya tha
 The Naxalites targeted the then state Congress president Nandkumar Patel, former Union minister Vidyacharan Shukla, former minister Mahendra Karma, former MLA Uday Mudaliar in this attack
 SIT jaanch karaayegi congresis ghatana ke teen din baad rajya kii tatkaaleen bijepi sarkaar ne ek nyaayik ayog kaa gathan kiya tha
 But even after five years, when the report did not come up, the Congress government called it a political conspiracy and decided to conduct an investigation of the entire incident with SIT
 chhattisgarh sarkaarake mantralay main NIA kii vistrut jaanch report kaa intjaar ho rahaa he
 The state's Congress government has written a letter to the NIA asking for full details of the Jhiram scandal
 chhattisgarh main paanch saal pehle hue jheram ghati hamale kii jaanch ab special investigeshan team se karai jaaegi
 The NIA has demanded the return of the case in addition to the conclusion of the investigation and the final report, before this investigation can begin
 rajya ke police mahanideshak ne NIA ko is bare main patr likhaa he
 The NIA questioned neither the then SP and IG of Bastar nor other responsible police and administration officials in the investigation of such a major attack

 But the then government did not take any of his objections seriously

 Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel has sought full details of the incident from the NIA at the earliest, so that the SIT investigation can be started at the earliest
 chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri bhupesh baghel kaa kahana he ki yah rajnatik sajeesh kaa hissaa he
 His party workers and select leaders were killed under a conspiracy

 State DGP DM Awasthi says that the entire case has been sought back from the NIA
 unhone iske liye chitthee bhi NIA ko bheji he
 He refused to disclose the names of the members of the SIT
 is ghatana se peedit rajya ke cabinet mantri umesh patel ne ummid jaahir kii ki unki sarkaar is rajnatik shadyantr kaa sach sabake saamne laaegi or gunaahagaaron ko sajaa bhi milegi
 The investigation was not completed even after five years, apart from the NIA investigation, the then BJP government of the state had constituted a judicial commission on 28 May 2013 to investigate the Jhiram Valley massacre
 hoicourt ke nyaayadhish prashanth kumaar mishra kii adhyakshata main gathit is nyaayik ayog ko teen maah ke bheetar apni jaanch report sarkaar ko saunpny thi, lekin aaj paanch saal baad bhi yah ayog jheram ghati hatyakand kii jaanch puri nahin kar paaya he

 But the CBI did not consider the matter suitable for investigation, citing the nia's investigation and the formation of a judicial commission

 Whereas under the protocol, the responsibility of the security of all its big leaders was with the Chhattisgarh Police and the State Government
 bastar main parivartan yatra ke dauraan road opening party ko achaanak hataa liya gaya tha
 The Congress also argues that such a large mob of Naxalites was present in the Jhiram Valley, but why the police and intelligence department was not aware of this, it is conceivable

 Not only this, cds of Naxalites and some suspiciously influential persons regarding Jheeram Ghatikand had also come out in these years, but the state government also scrutinized it

 ( input bhashaa se ) (from input language) saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 'modi lahar' ke sahare bijepi ne camel khilaakar puure desh ko bhagava rang main rang diya tha
 Narendra Modi ascended to power with 282 Lok Sabha seats
 1984 ke baad ke 30 saalon main bijepi aisi pehali party bani, jisane apane dam par bahumat hasil kiya
 But this color has faded in four years of Modi Raj
 kam se kam loksabhaa upachunaav ke nattejey to yahi kehete hai jahaan vipaksh se modi sarkaar ko jatke par jatke sahane pade hai
 As a result, the BJP has come down from 282 seats to 270 in the Lok Sabha
 2014 ke baad se desh main loksabhaa kii 21 siton ke liye upachunaav hue hai
 Of these, 11 seats were in the possession of BJP, but now only four of these seats have been retained by BJP
 21 main se 17 siten vipaksh ke naam raheen
 That is, BJP lost 7 seats, three are currently running for by-elections, while two have resigned their leaders in Karnataka
 270 siton ke baavjood bijepi centre kii satta main ab bhi majboot he, lekin uski nirbharta apane endie gathbandhan ke sahyogi dalon par badi he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi contested two Lok Sabha seats in the 2014 elections
 inamen gujarat kii vadodara or upi kii varanasi seat shaamil thi
 He resigned from Vadodara seat after winning both the seats by a huge vote
 modi kii tarah hi mulaayam singh yadav bhi mainpuri or azamgarh seat se jite the
 He had left the Mainpuri seat
 iske alaava kendriya mantri rahe gopinath munde ke nidhan ke chalate khaali hui bid loksabhaa seat par bhi upachunaav hue
 Of these, BJP managed to save Vadodara and Beed seats, while SP also saved Mainpuri seats
 madhya pradesh ke ratlam-jhabua loksabhaa seat upachunaav se bijepi kii haar kaa silsilaa shuru hua
 Ratlam seat became a hindrance in the way of 'modi wave' in 2015 and BJP lost this seat to Congress
 saal 2014 se ab tak hue upachunaav main bijepi apni sirf 4 siten bachaa pai he
 In the Lok Sabha by-elections held in 2017 and 2018, the Modi wave slowed down
 bijepi ne gurdaspur, alvar, ajmer, gorakhpur, phulpur siten ganvaa deen
 In 2017, the Gurudaspur Lok Sabha seat of Punjab was vacated due to the demise of Vinod Khanna, which was won by Sunil Jakhar of Congress
 isi saal march main upi ke gorakhpur or phulpur main hue upachunaav main bijepi ko karaari shikast mili thi
 The UP BJP also failed to save the seat of its Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Maurya
 bijepi ke in seat par haar ke myne kuch alag the, kyonki donon siton par saalon tak dushman rahi espi-bispi ne milakar bijepi ke saath muqabla kiya tha
 In the by-elections in Kairana, gondia-bhandara, Palghar, the BJP has a challenge to save its seats in Kairana in UP, gondia-bhandara in Maharashtra and Palghar
 bataa den ki bijepi saansad hukum singh ke nidhan ke baad se kairana loksabhaa kii seat khaali he
 bjp's Nana Patole resigned from bhandara-gondia seat last year and joined the Congress
 vahiin bijepi saansad chintamani vanagaa ke nidhan ke baad palghar seat khaali hui he
 BJP will have to face tough competition from the opposition in these three seats

 ' ek achche or safal rishte ke liye jaruri he ki pati-patni ek-duusare kaa sammaan karen
 Respect should not be just for saying or narrating
 aise main donon ko hi ye koshish kerani chahie ki ve apane baat-vyavhaar main aisi baaten na karen jisase duusare ko dukh pahunche
 To keep the relationship happy, both husband and wife should never do these three things to each other: 1
 meri najaron main ab tumhaari koi izzat nahinshaadi ke kuch saalon baad pati-patni donon ko hi aisa lagata he ki unhen wo izzat nahin mil rahi he jiske wo hakdaar hai
 In such a situation, they start degrading each other on everything
 baat is kadar aage bad jaati he ki wo khuleam ye kehane se bhi nahin chookte hai ki ab unki najaron main apane saathi ke liye koi izzat nahin rah gai he
 It should be tried that the matter should be handled before it can move forward and the relationship should be carried forward with understanding

 Can't you do anything right? Often husbands complain to wives and wives to husbands complain that they don't do anything right

 kisi duusare ke saath tulana karnakisi duusare ke saath apanepartneraki tulana karnaa bilkul galat he
 By doing this, your partner feels that you are no longer interested in him
 aapkaa partner is baat ko lekar aap par shaq bhi kar saktaa he ki aap kisi or ke prati aakarshith hai or usase alag hona chaahate hai

 Now the US investigative agencies are saying the same thing
 'pro publica' akhbaar ne ek report main khulaasa kiya he ki aatankwaadi david hedli kaa iesai se sidhaa rishta or vah pakistan kaa jasoos tha
 ISI chief Shuja Pasha was also aware that he was about to attack Mumbai
 america court ke kagajaton or intelligence afasaron ke intervyuu par aadhaarit he pro publica main chhapi investegative report
 Journalist Sebastian Rotella wrote that according to American and Indian investigative officials, Headley was a spy of Pakistan, not just a terrorist
 yah baat pehle bharat ne kaha or ab america bhi ise maan rahaa he ki pakistan kii iesai kaa 26 / 11 ke hamalo se sidhaa rishta he
 India's Home Secretary GK Pillai had already said that the ISI had complete control over the Mumbai attacks and was operating it
 report ke mutabik jaanch se ab pehali baar saaf hua he iesai kaa dabl game
 America's biggest partner in the fight against terrorism, but the backing of many Pakistani terrorist groups
 
 
 iske kai saboot hai
 From the investigation documents that Pro Publica has, it is clear that the ISI officers have helped Lashkar in the attack on Mumbai
 pro publica ke dastavejon ke mutabik bharat or america donon ke jaanch adhikari bataate hai ki iesai ne hedli ko jasusi ke tareekon kii training di or thikaanon kii reki ke liye paise bhi
 Headley also said in his inquiry that Major Iqbal gave 25 thousand dollars to build a company in Mumbai
 apni poochtacha main hedli ne khud bataaya ki pakistan kii nausena nen samandar ke raste mumbai hamale kaa plan banaaya
 a frogman from the Navy helped plan the attack
 hedli ke iesai sutron ne ek danish akhbaar par hamalaa karne ke lashkar ke plan main bhi hissaa liya
 Headley also said that ISI top officials approved every operation of Lashkar
 iesai kii bhavishya main bhi hamale kii yojana he
 Answering questions from Indian officials in the presence of the US intelligence agency FBI, Headley said that when he reached Pakistan after gathering information before the Mumbai attack, he met Major Iqbal
 ikbaal se hi hedli ko aadesh milte the or vah unki maangi jaankariyaan jutata tha
 According to Headley, he would record pictures and videos in two memory sticks, one for lashkar-e-taiba and the other for ISI
 mumbai hamalon ke baad pakistan ne lashkar ke military chif ko giraftaar kar jail main daalaa, par ye sirf dikhaava tha
 Headley has also told that ISI Chief Shuja Pasha went to jail to meet Lakhvi
 obama prashasan aatank par roak lagane main pakistan kii naakaami se pareshaan he yaa ye kahen ki aatank ko rokane kii pakistan kii niyat hi nahin he, tabhi to in tamaam sabooton ke baavjood aaropee khule gum rahe hai
 The relationship between Washington and Islamabad recently got tense when the CIA officer was recalled by the US after the cia's station chief was named in a civil suit
 america ise iesai kii hi karatuut bataa rahaa he
 Despite all the evidence that Pakistan has not taken any action so far, on the contrary, India has been accused of ending indo-pak talks

 mumbai hamalon main shaamil hone ke aarope se chicago kii ek adaalat dwaara bari tahawwur rana ko 26 / 11 hamalon ke bare main pehle se jaankaree thi or vah iske andruni jaankaron main tha
 According to US prosecutors, Pasha of lashkar-e-taiba briefed him about the impending attacks during a meeting in Dubai
 sahaayak atorni victoria peters ne chicago kii adaalat main rana kii sunwaayee se pehle nyayadhishon ko ek band kamare main sunwaayee ke dauraan bataaya, mumbai shahar par hamalaa rana ke liye anpekshit nahin tha
 He was aware of the attacks
 vah pehle se hi is bare main jaanata tha
 Peters said, he was told about the attacks by David Headley and he also knew about it because Pasha had informed him in Dubai
 unhone kaha ki 2008 kii garmiyon main rana ko uske bachapan ke dost hedli ne hamale kii puri sajeesh ke bare main bataaya tha
 Headley has admitted to being involved in the Mumbai attacks
 unhone kaha, vah jaanata tha ki lashkar ladaake mumbai par hamale kii yojana ko antim rup de rahe hai
 Assistant Attorney told, Rana was told about the attacks by Headley but Pasha also informed him about this
 hedli ne pasha se kaha tha ki vah america waapas lautate hue rana ko mumbai main nahin rukne ke kahe
 Pasha did the same in Dubai
 usne rana ko is bare main chetaya
 You know from the statements given by Rana that he was already aware of the Mumbai attacks
 peters ne is silsile main rana or hedli ke bich hui baatcheet kaa likhit byora adaalat main pesh kiya
 According to the details, Headley asked, did not Pasha say so? Rana: Yes Headley: When did he mention it? Rana: What, Headley: Pasha had said that in Dubai like this
 
 And Rana said, and he told me so
 The US attorney told that Pasha had warned Rana
 unhone kaha, jeuri ke sadasyon, hedli or rana ke bich yah baatcheet ahm he
 This shows that Pasha warned him that we were near
 This conversation, he said, suggests that Pasha knew that Rana was an insider
 pasha rana par bharosa kar saktaa tha
 Pasha knows that Rana knows
 kya ho agar rana andruni jaankaron main nahin tha? kya ho agar rana ko bilkul jaankaree nahin thi ki mumbai par hamalaa hone ja rahaa he? sahaayak atorni ne kaha, is bare main sochie
 Don't you expect that if he was aware that the attacks were imminent, don't you expect him to go to the FBI, the police or anyone else when the attacks took place and when these armed attackers held Mumbai hostage for three days and Say, see, there is a person named Pasha whom i met in Dubai and he informed me before the attacks that i should not go to Mumbai
 unhone kaha, agar rana usee dal kaa sadsy nahin tha to pasha ne use jaankaree kyon di? pasha ko rana par vishwaas tha
 He knows that Rana is Headley's trusted friend, so there is no risk
 yah chetavanee dene main koi jokhim nahin he

 kuch logon ke liye vah rashtravaadi senaanee hai to kuch unhen angrejon se maafee maangane vaala avasarwaadi kehete hai
 After all, how should Savarkar be seen, how is Savarkar related to Hindutva, what should be his rightful place in history? Regarding this, the forum of Sahitya Aaj Tak 2019 was hotly debated among many intellectuals
 sahitya ajtak ke duusare din is bahes main itihaaskaar irfan habib, raajnneetik vishleshak ashutosh, rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ke jaankaar evam chintak deshratn nigam, lekhak nilanjan mukhopadhyaay or patrkaar vaibhav purandare shaamil hue

 ve jail se baahar aakar desh kii aazaadee ke liye kaam karnaa chaahate the
 But Bhagat Singh did not apologize, on this question, the corporation said that no one can be compared
 unhone kaha, 'kya gandhi kii shahid krantikariyon se tulana kar sakate yah kah sakate hai ki ve kaayar the, jab ve ahimsa kii baat karte the? sabaki ranneeti alag thi, lekin gol ek tha- bharat kii aazaadee
 Ashutosh said that Savarkar was not alone in the Andaman jail, there were 500 other prisoners as well, so why did he not apologize
 iske jawaab main vaibhav purandare ne kaha ki aurbindo ghosh ne bhi marsi petishan likhi thi
 What did he want to do by apologizing, Ashutosh said that the real question is what Savarkar ultimately wanted to do by apologizing
 irfan habib ne kaha ki tulana unke bich kerani chahie jo cellular jail main the
 If this was a strategy, what did he do after coming out of jail? nigam ne kaha ki jail se baahar aakar saavarkar isliye swatantraaa sangram ke liye kaam nahin kar paae kyonki un par kai tarah ke pratibandh laga die gaye
 Neelanjan Mukhopadhyay said that after coming out of jail, he worked for Hindutva and not for the independence of the country
 sahitya ajtak kii puri kawarej yahaan dekhenmaphi se bhi bade ye hai saavarkar ke aparaadh!ashutosh ne kaha ki saavarkar ko isliye zyada kathghare main khadaa karnaa hoga ki unhone 1942 main bharat chodo andolan ke dauraan unhone british logon kaa saath diya
 The Hindu Mahasabha supported it by a resolution
 shyama prasad mukherjee ne hindu mahasabha ke pratinidhi ke rup main muslim lig ke saath gathjod kiya
 Savarkar recruited the army for the British, Savarkar was arrested in the Gandhi assassination
 nigam ne iske jawaab main kaha ki 95 fisadi congressiyon ne bhi quit india kaa virodh kiya tha
 Gandhiji's opinion was dominant
 yah record main he ki congress ke kai netaaon ne kaha tha ki yah upyukt samay nahin he

 vaibhav purandare ne kaha ki ve shaayad muslimon se mukaable ke liye hinduon kii sena main bhartee karana chaahate the, us samay british army main muslim zyada the
 If Savarkar supported Hitler, then Subhash Chandra Bose also took help
 Why did Savarkar support Nazism, Fascism and Hitler? On this Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay said that Hedgewar and Munje were also supporters of Hitler
 lekin iske jawaab main sangh ke samarthak nigam ne kaha ki subhash chandra bose ne bhi hitler or japan kaa sahyog liya tha
 Savarkar wanted to seek help under similar thinking
 unke saamne ek ranneeti thi
 The big goal was India's independence
 nilanjan ne is par kaha ki subhash chandra bose bhi sawaalon se pare nahin hai
 Purandare said that it is not right to compare Savarkar with anyone else
 saavarkar ke kaam ko do phej main dekhnaa hoga
 The punishment he was receiving was very strict, so many fighters, including Savarkar, demanded relief in it
 saavarkar kii rihaai par subhash chandra bose ne bhi khushi jaahir kii thi
 Was Savarkar's contribution in the Gandhi assassination Ashutosh said that the court acquitted Savarkar in the Gandhi assassination if there was no evidence
 kapur kamishan ne unhen doshi mana tha
 In response, Desharatna Nigam said that when the court says that there is no evidence that can connect Savarkar in this murder, then how will you treat him
 kapur kamishan koi court nahin tha, yah congress dwaara raajnneetik uddeshy se gathit kiya gaya tha
 Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay said that it was formed by Lal Bahadur Shastri, then how will you see which people you know better Prime Minister
 neelanjan ne kaha ki nathuram us akhbaar kaa editor tha jisaki saavarkar ne sthapana kii thi
 Savarkar's name was on the masthead of this newspaper
 jawaab main nigam ne kaha ki saavarkar kii nathuram ke saath antim baithak main kya charchaa hui, koi nahin jaanata
 There are only speculations about this
 ise koi sabit nahin kar saktaa ki usamen mahatma gandhi kii hatya ke bare main baat hui
 Purandare said that there is no legal evidence that Savarkar was involved in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, but he supported Godse and Company, which was wrong
 saavarkar or sangh main kya tha rishtalekhak irfan habib ne kaha ki areesus ke kareeb the saavarkar or aresas ne unke hindutv kii soch ko apanaaya
 He said that the people of the RSS who talk about their ideal heroes, about whom they said they took part in the freedom struggle, why are they not named in the National Archive
 vaibhav purandare ne kaha ki isaki do vajah ho sakati he
 Hedgewar was actually inspired by Savarkar's Hindutva
 yah aresas ke liye holi text tha
 Savarkar was a freedom fighter for the RSS
 hindutv kaa unka concept bhi aresas ke vichaar se miltaa tha
 Both Hindus believed in aggression
 unhone kaha ki bahut saal tak congress ne galat kiya hoga, lekin dakshinpanthi log unki galatiyon ke peeche nahin chhip sakate
 If we write a book, if not on the power of a government, we have written books in personal capacity, then what prevented right-wing writers from writing their history
 ashutosh ne kaha ki aresas kii vichaardhaara ke log hameshaa yah kehete rahe hai ki itihaas vamapanthiyon dwaara likhaa gaya
 This thinking is actually due to his infrastructure complex and politics of revenge
 saavarkar ke khud ke jivan ke do hisson kii tulana karen to kaaphi virodhabhas he
 There are different types of Savarkar after visiting Andaman
 vah aresas ke vaicharik foundation head he

 Ashutosh said, 'when Modi ji came after Atal Bihari's lack of charisma, first he talked about walking with everyone, but could not walk, then he came back to charisma
 atal bihari ke 6 saal main kya saavarkar ko uchit sammaan nahin mila? subhash chandra bose ke upar bhi tamaam tarah ke pratibandh lagaae gaye or ve japan chale gaye
 Established Azad Hind Fauj
 saavarkar ko aisa karne se kisne roka tha? golwalkar ne kaha tha ki aresas swatantraaa sangram main hissaa nahin legaa, iskaa aitihaasik pramaan he
 Golwalkar said that our youth has become confused
 'is par nilanjan mukhopadhyaay ne kaha ki vaajapeyi ne bhi bharat ratna dene kaa prayaas kiya tha, lekin raashtrapati ne khaarij kiya, loksabhaa main unka portate lagane kii koshish kii gai
 Savarkar went to jail after Gandhi's assassination, RSS leader went to jail
 aazaadee ke baad to saavarkar kaa koi naam lene vaala nahin tha, lekin indira gandhi ne unki tarif kii, un par documentry banaai gai
 The truth is that Savarkar and the RSS did not have good relations
 saavarkar ke jivan ke teen charan dikhte hai
 He was a freedom fighter before 1911 when he wrote a book describing the first freedom struggle in 1857, followed by his Guru of Hindutva phase, which lasted until 1921
 iske baad jab andaman jail se vah reeha hue to uske baad ek alag tarah kaa phej aayaa
 Desharatna Nigam said, 'the membership of the RSS is quite informal, whichever branch has gone, it can be a member of the RSS
 ham bahut se logon ko sangh main shaamil hone kaa ofer dete he, kuch shaamil hote hai or kuch baahar se hi saport karte hai
 He said that the RSS believes that whoever lives in this country is a Hindu, while Savarkar excludes Muslims from Christianity
 unhone swatantraaa sangram kaa aadhaar taiyaar kiya
 There can be no one or two ideals for Indians
 kareeb 70 saal tak saavarkar ko nazarandaaj kiya gaya
 Hedgewar, Golwalkar were also ignored
 kya freedom stregal main shunya he sangh kaa yogadanakya freedom stregal main aresas kaa yogadan shunya he,is sawaal par nigam ne kaha, 'aazaadee se pehle sabhi log congress main shaamil hokar swatantraaa sangram se judate the
 The founder of the union itself, Dr
 headgavar congress main the, unka vaicharik matbhed hua to ve do baar jail gaye
 The volunteers of the Sangh worked during the non-cooperation movement, the invasion of the tribesmen on Kashmir
 itane vivaad ke baad aakhir saavarkar ko bharat ratna kyon milinigam ne kaha ki congress ne indira gandhi ke bete rajeev gandhi ko bharat ratna diya to saavarkar to unase 100 guna zyada behatar hai
 Bharat Ratna should be given to a person who participated in the freedom struggle, whose release was also supported by Subhash Chandra Bose
 loktantr main yah janata kaa chwis he ki kise bharat ratna diya jaae yaa nahin
 On the question of Hedgewar, Golwalkar getting Bharat Ratna, the corporation said that Dr
 himself
 headgavar, golwalkar kisi bhi tarah kaa puraskaar lene ke khilaaf the, yah unke darshan kaa hissaa he
 The RSS does not operate under the guise of getting any kind of award

 Aaj Tak had a special conversation with Mayank in Jaipur
 mayank ne bataaya ki unhen arjees pariksha kii taiyaari main kitni mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 He talked about his interest in becoming a good judge
 mayank ne kaha ki jaahir he bahut khushi ho rahi he
 i had expected that the selection would be done but i did not expect such a good result
 mere or mere parivaar ke liye ye bahut khushi kii baat he
 There is an atmosphere of happiness since the result has come in the house
 ye mere liye bahut kathin tha
 i was in the final year after completing my college studies
 uske baad maine taiyaari kerani shuru kii, jisase mujhe zyada padhai main dhyaan dena padaa
 i studied for 11-12 hours diligently
 lakshya ye tha ki pariksha shuru hone se pehle main apana silebus khatm kar sakuun or exam main acha kar paaun
 21-year-old Mayank also said that reducing the minimum age limit from 23 to 21 by the Rajasthan High Court proved very helpful for him
 pehali baar jab rikt padon ke liye notification aayaa tha, tab main pariksha dene ke liye yogya nahin tha
 But later he reduced his age and i qualified
 main apane aap ko kismat vaala samajhataa hum
 i feel great that i achieved this rank
 mayank ne kaha ki unhone isi saal rajasthan uniwarsity se 5 saal kaa belelbi kiya he
 Talking about his inspiration, he said that when i was in the 12th standard, i used to think how important role of judicial in society is
 nyaayalayon main pending maamle bahut zyada hai
 i wanted to contribute so that people could be given justice
 shaayad mere liye vahi prerana bani jisaki vajah se ye kiya
 Asked what should be the criterion for him to become a good judge, Mayank said that honesty is necessary first of all
 eemaandaaree kisi bhi public sarvent ke liye bahut mahatvapurn he kyonki eemaandaaree se hi nyaaypalika main logon kaa vishwaas bana rahata he
 i think sensitivity is very important towards social issues
 mahilaon yaa bacchon se sambandhit faisle dene ke maamle main meraa maananaa he ki jaj ke liye bhedbhaavarahit hona bahut jaruri he kyonki faisle ke liye unhen objectiveli saare tathyon ko dekhnaa padataa he, uske baad faisla dena hota he
 i think it is very important to have these qualities in a judge
 aaj samaaj main kai aise factors hai jo public sarvent ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 Your responsibility is on muscle power and money power to stay away from all those influences
 jajment dete samay dhyaan rakhen ki wo sirf jaj hai
 They are limited to their courtrooms
 usamen jo tathy uske saamne aaenge unako dekhakar use nirnay dena hoga naa ki dusron kii baaten sunakar
 Asked what he thinks about his career by becoming a judge at the age of 21, Mayank said that i think i will prove to be better for Rajasthan Judicial
 kam umr main chaynit hone kaa yahi phayda hoga ki mere paas sevaayen dene ke liye lanbaa samay hoga
 i feel that i will get more time to serve people and i will be able to contribute more
 apane shauk ke bare main wo bataate hai ki mujhe kitaaben padhanaa bahut pasand he
 i read a lot of novels, etc
 iske alaava soshal work karnaa bahut acha lagata he
 Whenever i get free time, i attach to him

 thailand main baadh se prabhavit ek gupha main fanse 12 bachche samet 13 logon ko sakushal baahar nikaal liya gaya, lekin bachaav abhiyaan ke dauraan bacchon ko trengkvalizer (shaamak aushadhi dekar shant karnaa) die jane kii khabar aane ke baad puure mishan par vivaad badhata ja rahaa he, haalanki thai pradhanmantri ne aisi anaesthesia jaisi koi dawa die jane se inkaar kiya he
 However, a British diver (diver) involved in the expedition to get a safe exit from the cave claimed that the children were drugged with ketamine before being taken out of the cave
 dar se bachaane ke liye di gai dawadaily mail ne british gotaakhor ke hawaale se likhaa he ki use bataaya gaya ki bacchon ko ketamine diya gaya he jise horse yaa cat trengkvalizer kaha jaataa he, amuman iskaa istemaal sadak par chalane vaale jaanwaron ko dimagi taur par shant rahane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Many other divers have also spoken of giving such medicines to children
 rescue mishanse jude gotakhoron kaa kahana he ki yah dawa die jane ke baad bachche puri tarah se shant ho gaye or apane bas main nahin rahe
 He went into unconsciousness in a way
 trengkvalizer jaisi dawa die jane ke peeche yah tark diya ja rahaa he ki bacchon ko pani main utaarne ke dauraan ve dar or saham sakate hai jisase abhiyaan par asar pad jaataa
 Why ketamineketamine is usually light yellow in color
 yah dawa us sthiti main di jaati he jab kisi ko dard se raahat dena ho, achetavastha main le janaa ho yaa phir dimagi tanaav ko hataanaa ho
 However, it is being said that the children trapped in the cave were given stunned medication before being evacuated so that they do not get scared and terrorized by going through the dark, narrow and underwater paths and the people involved in the rescue team should be given additional problems
 Do not face it
 ketamine die jane ke baad insaan ke dil kaa kaam karnaa or dhadkna saamaanya rahata he
 After injecting the drug, its effect starts appearing in 5 minutes and it becomes fully effective in 25 minutes
 kitna nuksaandeh he ketaminahaalanki iskaa vipareet asar bhi pad saktaa he, is kaaran unhen ghabrahat, vyakulata or matibhram ke saath-saath blad pressure or dil kii dhadakanen badhane kaa dar rahata he
 Breathing may occur in the event of falling blood pressure
 aise main gupha main saans lene kii dikkat badhati jo gupha main fanse bacchon kii jaan par aa jaati
 The Prime Minister of Thailand has denied any such harmful medication, but admitted that the children were given a medicine that is usually given to soldiers, which reduces fear
 philhal bachche ab vahaan se nikal chuke hai or aspataal main ilaaj kara rahe hai, unke parijanon ko abhi unase milane nahin diya ja rahaa
 The family can see them from behind the glass wall
 2 hafte se zyada samay tak gupha main rahane ke baad baahar nikaale gaye bacchon ko parijanon se isliye dur rakhaa ja rahaa he taaki unhen kisi tarah kaa infction na ho

 ' On Thursday, the issue of selling the drug 'divya Putrajivak' to be born in the dispensaries of Yogguru Swami Ramdev was raised in Rajya Sabha on Thursday
 is mudde par jamkar hangaamaa hua
 As soon as the proceedings of the House began, the issue was raised by Janata dal-united (JD-U) member KC Tyagi and demanded an inquiry
 tyaagi ne divya farmesi (haryana) kaa utpaada 'divya putrajeevak' dikhaate hue kaha, pradhanmantri ne beti bachaao, beti padhaao kaa aahvaan kiya he or baba ramdev beti nahin, betaa paidaa karne par jor de rahe hai, iske liye dawa banaakar bech rahe hai, yah kaisaa virodhabhas he
 He said, i bought it to show you and i have brought the receipt
 koi ise purana maal nahin kah saktaa
 Tyagi said, has the Indian government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved Baba Ramdev to sell such things? isi bich, unase dawa kaa packet samaajawaadee party (sapa) kii sadsy jaya bachchan ne le liya or sadan main maujuud kendriya swasthya mantri jepi nadda ke haath main rakh diya

 We will look into the matter and take action
 jaya bachchan ne kaha ki sarkaar yah aashwaasan de ki vah aisi dawaaon ko bazaar se hataayegi or iskaa nirmaan karne waalon ke khilaaf karrwai karegi

 It is worth mentioning that the price of this drug which produces a son is 10 on the website of Divya Pharmacy
 99 dollar likhaa he
 It has been said that 'putrajivak' is a unique herbal product, which is aphrodisiac, abortionist and helps in eradicating infertility

 If there is an attempt to determine sex through a drug or to know the prenatal sex, then it is against the law and if it is encouraged by a state government, it is against the constitution, but in this case the Speaker of the House Or the vice president cannot do anything

 This will be Narendra Modi's first visit to Varanasi after becoming Prime Minister
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki pradhanmantri kaa ye daura do divasiy hoga
 Modi will arrive in Varanasi on 7 November and will leave for Delhi on 8 November
 is dauraan pradhanmantri biechayu ke troma centre kaa uddhatan karenge saath hi saath ek gaanv ko god lene kii prakiya ko puraa karenge
 According to sources, a fax has also been sent to the District Magistrate Office of Varanasi regarding the arrival of the Prime Minister
 pradhanmantri kaa ye daura oktober maheene main hone vaala tha
 But due to the possibility of heavy rains in eastern Uttar Pradesh due to Hudhud storm, the Prime Minister had to postpone his visit

 Over the years, the number of migrants from Bihar has increased significantly in Delhi and surrounding areas
 abhi bhi ye lagaataar bad rahi he
 But in proportion, the number of berths in the train going to Bihar does not match anywhere
 yahaan tak ki jab peak rash sijan nahin bhi hota tab bhi bihar ke liye tikat hasil karnaa aasaan nahin hota
 In such a situation, there are only two options left for those going to the home state in Emergency - either to get a recommendation from leaders or government officials for the quota seats or to pay a hefty ticket to the agents

 In 2004, there was a huge crowd of passengers at the New Delhi railway station on their way to Bihar on Chhath
 tab stesan par bhagdad machane se paanch logon kii maut ho gai thi
 In the year 2010 also, two people died in the incident of stampede at New Delhi railway station
 vahiin 2014 main bhi tyohaari sijan main hi isi stesan par ek vyakti kii maut hui thi
 The past governments' record in addressing the shortage of tickets compared to the passengers of trains going from Delhi to Bihar has also been disappointing, but did the current government do much to run adequate trains between Delhi and Bihar? Lok Sabha 2014 elections In Bihar, people of Bihar had voted overwhelmingly for Narendra Modi both in Bihar and Delhi
 bihar main NDA ne 40 loksabhaa siton main se 31 par jeet hasil kii thi, vahiin dilli main sabhi 7 seat par kamyaabi pai thi
 It is natural that the people of Bihar had high expectations from the present government
 soochna ke adhikaar (RTI) ke tahat india today ne yachika daakhil kar railway se ye jaananaa chaha ki maujuuda sarkaar ne dilli or patna ke bich kitni nai train chalaayin?railway kii ore se ye jawaab mila-1
 a total of 23 pairs of mail / express trains were running between Delhi and Patna in 2014
 2
 There are a total of 27 pairs of mail / express trains running between Delhi and Patna
 iskaa matlab he ki modi sarkaar ne is root par beete chaar saal main sirf 4 nai train shuru kii hai
 This increase is similar to cumin in the camel's mouth, given the number of passengers
 maang or aapurti ke asantulan ko chhodie, nai trainon kii sankhya dilli main lagaataar bad rahi pravaasiyon kii sankhya se bhi kahin mail nahin khaati he
 The squeeze is that whenever a person from Bihar thinks of going home on festivals, then the problems faced by him can be gauged by himself
 or in dikkaton ke nikat bhavishya main dur hone kii koi sambhaavna bhi najar nahin aati
 Veteran Pak fast bowler Umar Gul believes that Pakistan needs to make a radical change in its domestic structure by following the path of India to make the top-ranked team in all formats and improve the financial condition of players who are not able to make it to the national team

 The BJP is forming the government for the sixth consecutive time in the state
 lekin satorie bhaajapa par daanv lagaakar bhi karodon rupye haar gaye hai
 Exit poll results on 14 December
 jinamein sabhi agency or channels ne bhaajapa ko spasht bahumat bataaya
 After this, the prices of the BJP in the Satta Bazaar decreased and the Congress increased
 satta bazaar main jis party kii haarane kii ashanka hoti he, uske bhav zyada hote hai
 The BJP was fixed at 35
 bhaajapa kii 103 seat se upar aane par ek lakh rupye lagane vaale ko 1 lakh 35 hajaar rupye milte
 Whereas the Congress, which had invested 1 lakh rupees on getting 76 to 78 seats, would have got one lakh 35 thousand rupees
 hardik kaa bahaanaa- paise ke jor or EVM se hui BJP jisib bhaajapa kii siten 100 yaa 100 se kam aati dikh rahi hai
 In such a situation, those who bet on the BJP will lose their money
 jabaki congress kii seat 80 ke kareeb aati dikh rahi hai
 That means those who bet on the Congress are different
 yani congress bhale hi haar gai ho, lekin us par daanv lagane vaale jeet gaye hai or bhaajapa kii jeet ke baavjood us par daanv lagane vaale haar gaye
 Let us know that the election results have been fiercely speculated
 akele karnataka rajya main gujarat chunaav par 50 karod rupye kaa satta laga tha
 Before the exit poll on Thursday, the price of speculative market was running for BJP 92-94, while the price of Congress was going around 90-92

 Hence, there is no monotony in the entire show and due to participation it remains fun

 The journey of Kapil and his team has been tremendous so far

 akshay kumaar ne kaha ki vah beti ke janm se bahut khush hai or bacchee apni maa (tvinkal khanna) jaisi dikhti he
 The comments abhinayta ke kareebi sutron ne kaha, tvinkal ne aaj subah dakshin mumbai ke brich candi aspataal main beti ko janm diya
 The baby was born normally
 maa-beti donon swasth hai
 This is the second child of Akshay and Twinkle
 unka ek betaa he aarav 10 saal kaa he
 By the way, Akshay Kumar is very busy these days in his upcoming film Oh My God
 udhar, tvinkal ke liye pichley kuch din kaaphi baari rahe hai
 Because her father Rajesh Khanna passed away after a long illness, and pregnant Twinkle could not attend her father's last visit
 nanhee pari donon kii jindagi main khushiyon kii bahaar lekar ai he
 Sources close to the actor said, Twinkle gave birth to the daughter at Brich Candy Hospital in South Mumbai this morning
 bacchee kaa janm saamaanya rup se hua
 Both mother and daughter are healthy
 akshay or tvinkal kii yah duusari santan he
 They have a son Aarav who is 10 years old
 vaise, akshay kumaar in dinon apni aane vaali film 'oh maai god' main kaaphi vyast hai
 On the other hand, the last few days have been very heavy for Twinkle
 kyonki pichley dinon unke pita rajesh khanna kaa lambii beemaari ke baad nidhan ho gaya or garbhvatee tvinkal pita kii antim yatra main bhaag nahin le pai thim

 fast trek court se lekar supreme court ke jajon ko apane court room main taala lagaakar shimla chale janaa chahie or vahaan baadaam chhuhaada khaanaa chahie
 Because their work is finished
 kyonki soshal media se lekar samvidhan kii shapath lekar saasand bane or tivi par aane vaale saamaajik kaaryakartaaon ne telugana police kii ek asaamaajik karatuut ko sahi tehra diya he
 Apart from men, many women are also engaged in making that public opinion and are justifying this encounter under the guise of their own opinion
 yah vahi public opinian he jo akhlaaq or inspector subodh kumaar singh ko saream maarthe samay ek tarah se sochataa he, bheed ke saath khadaa ho jaataa he or yah vahi public opinian he jo telugana police kii encounter ko lekar bheed ban jaataa he
 Is Public Openion now a court? Then the courts should go on Twitter to see what the trend is today before the verdict
 sabhi ko pataa he ki is ghatana ko lekar gussa he
 If there is anger among women, then women mps are also telling the encounter right to make room for that anger
 pradhanmantri modi ne haal hi main jharkhand main shashibhushan mehta ke liye vot maanga tha jin par ek mahila teacher kii hatya kaa aarope he or is maamle main shashibhushan mehta zamaanat par hai
 Will Smriti Irani's anger be the same as it was in the Telangana case? Will she resign knowing this from Parliament? Knowing this, his associate MP Sakshi Maharaj is wishing the MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar on his birthday on rape and murder
 bangaramau se vidhayak kuldeep ko badhai dene ke liye mantroccharan kar rahe hai
 So what will Smriti Irani do then and now? An MP justifies the encounter of rape and murder accused and an MP wishes a birthday to a rape accused
 ediaar kii report ke anusaar 19 saansadon par mahilaon ke prati hinsa ke aarope hai or teen par balaatkaar ke aarope hai
 Will women mps demand an encounter within the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha for them? Did Smriti Irani and Jaya Bachchan Bhaduri get so angry even when Swami Chinmayananda, a former Minister of State for Home Affairs and former BJP MP, was accused of rape and sexual exploitation? Giving air
 ek vicitra tark diya ja rahaa he ki telugana encounter ko lekar sisaayat band ho
 Do not question meaning
 encounter par sawaal karnaa siyasat he to kya har encounter ke saath yah baat lagu hogi ki ham sawaal nahin karenge
 The Telangana police, who were being questioned, did nothing for two hours when the victim's family went to the police
 kaha ki kisi dost se milane bhaag gai hogi
 Three policemen were also suspended in this case
 jis police ne uske pehle ek or ghatana hone par ilaake main suraksha tej nahin kii, yah bhi ho saktaa he ki uske paas jaanch or suraksha ke paryaapt sansaadhan hi na hon, ab in saare sawaalon ko dhakelte hue is maamle ko encounter ke jashn par khatm kiya ja rahaa he
 Police is made great
 telugana police par jo phool barasaaye ja rahe hai yah tasviir bataa rahi he ki aam janata main nyaay vyavastha ko lekar samaj or bharosa kitna kamazor ho gaya he
 The law of the encounter has been changed to a scandal without trial, in the name of the law system that takes a long time or does not work
 kanoon par bharosa bhi nahin or sakht kanoon kii maang bhi
 There is a strict law
 nirbhaya cond ke baad justise verma kii cameti ne kitne upaay bataae
 Nirbhaya became a fund whose money could not be spent
 in sab sawaalon ko hataa kar ek bheed banaai gai he jo is encounter kaa swaagat kar rahi he
 Is anyone really believing in this story that when the police started collecting evidence about these criminals, then these people attacked the police with stones
 hathiyaar chin liye or sarender nahin kiya to goli maar di
 Have people really stopped thinking that flowers are raining on this fake story? When the police caught them on the basis of the evidence, why was there no attempt to prove the charges against them
 kya isliye encounter kiya gaya ki public opinian swaagat karegi
 People will also welcome mps
 police kii har theory par sawaal uth rahe hai
 Police say the culprits were experienced and snatched weapons from them and started driving
 anbhavi the phir bhi kisi police vaale ko goli nahin lagi
 Four of the four accused died of police firing
 aropiyon ne pathar se bhi police par hamalaa kiya
 The medical bulletin of both the injured cops says that some scratches have come on the forehead of a jawan
 duusare ke haath or kandhe par gaharaa zakhm he
 Even now, such a story is not made in films
 darshak ko pataa chal jaataa he
 They start laughing
 kamishnar sajjanar sahab jo kahani bataa rahe hai jo sunne main kahani hi lagati he
 After several hours of the encounter, the dead bodies were left there so that people would come and watch
 ek public opinian encounter ke fevar main bane
 What was the police waiting for? You search the internet police kii banaai aisi kahaniyon se aap sochane ke liye majaboor honge
 There are many cases in which the police created such a story, killed innocent people and called them criminals
 2009 main ghaziabad ke emb ke chaatr ranbir singh ko dehradur ke jangalon main le jaakar uttarakhand kii police ne 29 goliyaan maarin
 It is said that Ranbir Singh used to work as a ransom
 9 saal baad dilli hai court ne 2018 main is maamle main 7 police waalon ko aaajeevan sazaa sunai thi
 In 1992, the Punjab Police encounters a 15-year-old boy
 kahani banaai ki bacchon ne 20 minute tak police par firing kii thi
 In 2018, a CBI court found the encounter to be fake and sentenced two Punjab Police soldiers to life imprisonment
 november 1996 main upi police ne jilaluddin, jasbir, ashok or pravesh ko uthaakar encounter kar diya
 Told that they were criminals
 2017 tak parivaar waalon ne cese ladaa
 CBI court convicted four policemen for murder
 encounter farji niklaa
 Whenever the story of a police encounter is made, one should always doubt it and question it
 encounter ke mukademon ke itihaas yahi kehete hai
 The families have fought the case in court for 20-20 years
 ladakon kii jaan bhi gai or un par apradhi hone kaa jhootha daag bhi laga
 Recently, Justice Agarwal, a retired Justice of Chhattisgarh, reported that in 2012, 17 people were killed in Bastar by the CRPF and the police by falsely claiming them as Naxalites
 isamen chah bachche bhi the
 The way Naklasi is made public open, in the same way, this murder would also be justified
 kya farji encounter ke liye police ke saath encounter kaa insaaf tay kar diya jaae?thik se sochie ki telugana police ke encounter ko lekar bahut se log kyon khush hai? agar encounter sahi he to phir justise system kyon he? to phir kya aap taiyaar hai ki police jo kahegi use sahi maanenge, uske saamne kabuule gaye aparaadh ko hi nyaayalay antim nahin maanati he? kya aap bheed ke saath hone ke liye is encounter ke saath hai, to phir 2017 main balaatkaar ke 32 hazaar se adhik maamle darj hue the
 Should we arrange for an encounter at all? It was heard in many discussions that the police security was not sufficient near the toll in Hyderabad
 vahaan sisitivi kyon nahin tha
 This question arises and is lost in the middle
 balki isi sawaal ko thodi jagah dene kii zarurat thi
 There have been many such researches in the world which suggest that the designs of modern city also create an environment of insecurity for women or the weak
 hyderabad ke jis jagah par peedita ke saath balaatkaar kii ghatana hui or use jalaayaa gaya wo jagah bhi sunsaan thi
 There was less movement
 raushnee kam thi
 Now, at many levels, the study suggests that the design should be done in such a way that people do not appear far away
 vahaan footpath par vendor na ho
 There is only one way so that automobiles are super fast routes for cars
 jine jacob ne ek kitaab likhi he the Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961) inkaa kahana he ki shaharon ko logon ke hisaab se nahin banaaya gaya he
 Designed in such a way that people do not show far away
 sari jagahen automobil ke hisaab se banaai ja rahi hai
 Automobil devastated cities
 is kaaran asurakshit kone banane lag jate hai
 In this sense, you should see and understand the site of the incident
 yahaan keval gadiyon ke raste hai
 There is no facility for man to come and go
 is tarah se dizine hi hote hai ki dur dur tak ilaaka nirjan nazar aane lage
 Now when people see so many people here after the encounter, then people were seen
 logon ke nazar aane kii sambhaavna kya har vakt hogi? pataa kiijie jawaab naa main milegaa
 If roads were made with people, then crime would have reduced
 lekin is sawaal kaa jawaab aasaani se nahin milegaa
 If you get it, you will not believe that it will also be implemented
 ek street lite laga dene se aparaadh main fark pad jaataa he lekin kitne aise shahar hai jahaan street lite lagi hoti he
 So you start demanding the death penalty, knowing that death is not a punishment
 ab faansee kii sazaa maangate maangate encounter par tali baja rahe hai jaanate hue ki zyaadaatar encounter farji hote hai
 If you gave this exemption to the state government, then tomorrow someone will pick up and do a police encounter, then which society and institute will you go to for justice
 2014 main supreme court ne encounter ko lekar guideline jari kii thi
 There are 16 point guidelines
 kuch is prakaar hai
 
 
 After the encounter, the FIR of the case will be registered and the court related to the area will be sent
 - espi rank ke adhikari jaanch karenge or jaanch scientfic hogi - Encounter will be investigated by magistrate - do doctoron kii team maare gaye logon kaa postmortem karegi Till the investigation is completed, the police team involved in the encounter will not get advance before the turn
 kai baar encounter isliye bhi ho jate hai taaki pramotion mil jaae
 The rape victim was going to court in Unnao
 raste main use jala diya gaya
 The police will not give protection to such victims, but many times it seems to be standing in favor of the accused of rape, there should be a system for how that police should work or you should think properly about the encounter
 agar ye routine ban gaya to koun maaraa jayega yah bhi soch lijie
 The poor will be killed kuldeep singh senger jaise log paise dekar chhutate jaaenge
 You can go to Twitter and see only the tweets of those people who are supporting the encounter of Telangana Police
 bina tathyon ko jane subah se hi whatsap uniwarsity main massej chalane laga ki kya aap encounter ke saport main hai agar nahin to aap balaatkaariyon ke saport main he
 Calling the encounter wrong does not at all mean that someone is in support of rapists
 aakhir police apane jaanch ke dam par, kyon nahin sabit kar sakati he? haal hi main supreme court ne aadesh diya tha ki har zile main forencik lab bane
 All questions of building the system went backward
 encounter par jayakaare lagavaaye ja rahe hai taaki logon main sandesh jaae ki bada baari kaam hua he
 In the month of August, Arunabh Kaul analyzed The Fast Track Court in The Hindu newspaper
 smriti irani ne rajyasabha main kaha tha ki 2250 karod kharch kar desh bhar main 1023 fast trek court banaaya jayega taaki bacchon ke saath yon hinsa ke cese ke maamalon kii sunwaayee jaldi ho sake
 The Supreme Court had also ordered at the same time that wherever more than 100 cases of Poxo are pending, there should be a special court and a forensic lab should be established in every district
 2000 se lekar ab tak desh bhar main 581 fast trek court khole ja chuke hai jahaan 5 lakh 90 hazaar cese lambit hai

 Ravi Shankar Prasad has told in Parliament that more than half of the states like Karnataka, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh do not have fast track courts
 dilli ke neshnal laa uniwarsity ne fast trek court ne ek survey kiya tha
 In many courts, there was no arrangement for audio video recording of the victim, while none of them even had regular staff
 ye da hindi kii report he
 Neither the police system is good nor the court, but this poor system has given many such decisions in which criminals are punished after investigation
 mumkin he court ne logon ko fail kiya he
 The police failed the people but even then the mob violence and encounter are not the solution
 phir bhi bheed kii tarah sochna band kiijie
 Think like a citizen
 yah aadhaar bilkul nahin ho saktaa he ki sabhi raajnneetik dal ke saansad samarthan kar rahe hai? aap khud bhi sochie aap police ko license de rahe hai ki vah aapke gharon main ghuse or maar kar chali jaae
 You saw in Chhattisgarh that even children were killed as naxalites in a fake way

 To stand in support of the encounter, not only the police, but also to give license to the mob that can kill anyone in the name of such charges

 Sonia Gandhi arrived on a two-day visit to her constituency Rae Bareli on Tuesday after almost two years
 june 2016 ke baad sonia kaa apane sansadeey kshetra raibareli main naa aana kshetra ke logon ke liye dhire-dhire chintaa kaa vishay banataa ja rahaa tha
 In such a situation, Sonia's distance was forcing her to explore her option
 itnaa hi nahin bijepi sonia ke durg main sendhamari karne kii jugat main bhi he
 At such a time, Sonia's knock in Rae Bareli will give relief to the Congressmen
 bataa den ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress kii karaari haar ke bich sonia gandhi apana kila bachaane main safal rahi thim
 After this, the process of Sonia coming to Rae Bareli gradually started to decrease
 iske peeche ek badi vajah sonia kii sehat bhi rahi, jisaki vajah se wo pehle kii tarah raibareli kaa daura nahin kar paa rahi thim
 After the coronation of Rahul Gandhi as Congress President, Sonia Gandhi has turned to her constituency

 While he is an MLC himself, he has a brother from Harchandrapur MLA and a brother is the District Panchayat President

 That MLA is also Aditi Singh, daughter of that Bahubali Akhilesh Singh, who is more known as Akhilesh's daughter than Congress
 akhilesh singh bhi congress se vidhayak rahe hai, lekin rakesh pandeya kii hatya ke baad unhen party se nikaal diya gaya tha
 Despite this, they have won on their own, in the 2017 assembly elections, Akhilesh Singh's daughter Aditi Singh joined the Congress and won by a record number of votes
 iske baad raibareli nagar palika main bhi akhilesh ke kareebi ko tikat diya gaya or congress jeetne main safal rahi

 In such a situation, the Congressman of Rae Bareli was waiting for Sonia to come

 They will definitely be less

 Is India now able to compete with China? In fact, ever since China has warned India that the Indian Army should learn from the lessons learned from history, ie the defeat in the 1962 war, there has been a debate once again whether India can now compete with China Able to get Or now he has left her and gone ahead
 is bich raksha mantri arun jetali ne china kii dhamkee ke pratyuttar main yah kahkar tanaav ko or bhi hawa de di he ki 1962 ke bharat or 2017 ke bharat main fark he
 There were different circumstances then and now the circumstances are different
 'global times' main raksha visheshgyon kii raay par gaur kiya jaae to lagata he ki yadi maujuuda halaat nahin sulajhe to china apane bhubhag kii raksha ke liye kuch bhi kar saktaa he or yahaan tak ki yuddh kii had tak bhi ja saktaa he
 Here, the Indian government says that India is not at all responsible for the current tension, rather the dispute has been going on originally between China and Bhutan for three decades
 is kshetra main china kii dakhlandaji se bharat kii samprabhutaa par bhi khatra mandara saktaa he, isliye bhi bharat ko apni bhoomika nibhaani padi
 By the way, we should not forget here that if we have become very strong compared to 1962 and our country has made a lot of progress, then the speed of China is more than that
 aaj kaa china bhi 1962 vaala china nahin he balki tab kii tulana main vah kaaphi aage nikal chukaa he
 It is well known that India suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of China in the 1962 war
 us jang main bharat ke kareeb 1300 sainik maare gaye the or ek hajaar sainik ghayal hue the
 One and a half thousand soldiers had gone missing and about four thousand soldiers were taken captive
 vahiin china ke kareeb 700 sainik maare gaye the or dedh hajaar se zyada ghayal hue the
 Keeping this in mind, China has warned India to take a lesson from history
 ab jaraa yah samaj len ki aakhir kyon ek baar phir se bharat or china ke bich seemaa ko lekar khatpat ho rahi he? vivaad kaa kaaran bana doka-laa ilaaka bharat ke sikkim or bhutan ke bich chumbi ghati kshetra main sthit he
 In China it is known as Danglang and in Bhutan as Doklam
 isko lekar china or bhutan ke bich lambey samay se vivaad chalaa aa rahaa he, jise sulajhane ke liye 1984 se lekar ab tak 24 vaartaayen ho chuki hai
 India is concerned that this area of bhutan, where China is trying to build a road, is just below it
 'chiken nek' vah ilaaka he jo uttar-purv bharat ko baaki desh se jodta he
 If a road is built here, it will fall directly into the range of Chinese cannons
 philhal is ilaake main bharat majboot sthiti main he
 All our posts are at a height while China is down here
 pahari ilaakon main yah ranneetik taur par kaaphi phydemand hota he
 Here, China will have to take a lot of energy to uproot India
 is bare main jab maine kai aise visheshgyon se baat kii jo bharat-china sambadhon par gahari najar rakhte hai to sab is bare main ekamat dikhe ki 1962 se aaj ke halaat kaaphi badal chuke hai
 Of course, China has gone ahead of us strategically in many respects and if the circumstances of the battle arise due to any reason, then our chances of winning will be very low, but even for China this battle will not be as easy now

 Especially if we look at the border, our infrastructure is still weak compared to the way China has strengthened its infrastructure

 During the salute cricket program till date, former India captain Sourav Ganguly will be shocked to hear what he said about the explosive opener Virender Sehwag's batting
 ganguli ne kaha, ‘main mahaan salaami ballebaaj sunil gavaskar ke saath kabhi nahin khel sakaa lekin aakraamak, majboot or ran banane kii akut kshamta kii badaulat main sahvaag ko bharat kaa sarvshereshth salaami ballebaaj kah saktaa hum
 Ever since he started playing, for many years to come, i do not think that a bold batsman like him will be seen in the field
 ’saurav gangulise poocha gaya tha ki world tii20 main bharat kii kya sambhaavna he
 Ganguly said, 'the team is good but it is not easy to say who will become the champion
 ’chauke, chakke kii sochataa tha veerujab unhen yah bataaya gaya ki virendra sahvaag ne kaha he ki 99 fisadi bharat to ganguli bole, ‘veeru kii baaten unki ballebaaji jaisi hi he
 They only think of fours, sixes and sixes
 jab wo cricket khelte the tab agar wo out ho gaye or aapke bagal main baithe hai, aapaki ballebaaji he to aap unki camentry sun kar yah sochane lagate the ki maidan main cricket bahut hi aasaan he
 Batting is going on and Viru is speaking here
 
 
 maar cat chaar ran milegaa
 Sometimes you used to get up and go away
 ye bol kar ki tera cricket alag he meraa alag, mujhe to khilne de meraa game
 Veeru is such a cricketer, so he must have said that 99 percent of India will win
 ’jab injamaam ul haq se poocha gaya ki unki captaini ke daur main sahvaag apane charam par the to unhone kaha, ‘test match main pehle din kaa pehla ghanta chal rahaa he or maine paanch fielder boundry par khadey kar rakhe hai
 i doubt my captaincy myself
 jab sahvaag wicket par khadaa ho jaataa to iske liye fielding set karnaa bahut mushkil hota tha
 i used to say that neither it has its own respect nor does it respect anyone
 bahut khatarnaak cricketer tha
 Its quality was that there was a double century against us
 is kii ballebaaji par fielding set karnaa or captaini karnaa badi mushkil cheez thi
 "no bigger opener than Sehwag" Ganguly said, "I have never seen Gavaskar live but i have not seen a bigger opener than Virender Sehwag in Indian cricket
 shaayad agle 10-15 saal is tarah kii ballebaaji karne vaala openar nahin dekhne ko milegaa
 Ganguly shared a few things during the match
 unhone kaha, ‘unako aapako bolnaa padataa tha ki veeru thodaa sa roak le
 i never told him that Veeru has to win the match and play a little early
 unako kahana padataa tha ki veeru thodaa sa roak le
 
 
 And i used to say in ODI cricket
