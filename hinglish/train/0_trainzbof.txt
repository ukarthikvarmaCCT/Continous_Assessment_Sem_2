 He took his first life on the third question
 iske baad ve aage bade or 40 hajaar rupee ke sawaal par pahunche
 Arun Kumar Mishra stuck on which question? The question asked for 40 thousand rupees was - which classical dance is this person seen in the picture? Arun Kumar Mishra was shown pictures of Birju Maharaja and given options
 opshans tha- odissi, kathakali, bharatnatyam or kathak
 When Arun did not know the answer to the question, he flipped the question from his second life line
 unhone apane vishyon main relijan, culture and mithology ko chunaa tha isliye nayaa sawaal guru nanak dev ke bare main poocha gaya
 The question was - Which of these events in the life of Guru Nanak is related to Kartapur? Its options were - birth, education, marriage or death
 Arun did not know the correct answer to this question and so he took his third life line 50-50 
 do galat opshan mitane ke baad bhi jawaab naa soch paane par unhone apni aakhri life line lenaa sahi samajha
 With only 2 seconds left for Arun to answer, he asked for the last life line Ask the Expert Life Line

 Taking a strong attack on his former ally BJP announcing that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold rallies in Maharashtra, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has said that if the BJP was so confident of its victory with the 'modi wave', then the Prime Minister would get public Is not called upon to address
 unhone kaha, unki (bijepi) ore se kai bayaan aae hai jo aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav se pehle kai reliyon ko sambodhit karne kii modi kii yojana kaa khulaasa karte hai

 Actress Kriti Sanon told India Today Conclave what changed in Bollywood due to the Meat Movement
 maaloom ho industry main pichley saal mitu movement ne tab jor pakadaa jab tanushri datta ne actor naanaa patekar par gambhir aarope lagaae
 After this, many big stars were charged under the Meetu movement
 kriti senon ne is abhiyaan par kaha- mujhe khushi he ki iske bare main baat hui
 It takes great courage to put these things in front of the world
 ab log bol rahe hai ye acchhee baat he
 i do not know if the industry is safe now or not, but it is so sure that fear has arisen in the people
 koi bhi industry ho, logon main ye dar he ki kuch galat karenge to naukari se ja sakate hai
 That fear born in people was very important
 ye movement bahut jaruri tha
 What did Kriti bid on pay parity in Bollywood? Kriti said, "sometimes there is a big difference in the feel of mail-female actors
 kabhi ye antar 2 or 8 kaa hota he
 Sometimes 10 and 15 also differ
 lekin kabhi ye gap 2 se 200 tak pahunch jaataa he
 i do not understand this gap
 lekin abhi bhi fees gap main itnaa badwaal nahin hua he
 Women have to raise their voice
 mail actors paisa badaye to kisi ko dikkat nahin hoti
 But if an actress increases her fees, then different things happen

 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently urged the US to set a 'boundary line' on Tehran's nuclear program, beyond which the US would be forced to act
 iran kaa kahana he ki vah urja utpaadan ke liye uranium sanvardhan kaa kaam kar rahaa he, vahiin pashchimi deshon ko ashanka he ki vah parmaanu hathiyaaron ke vaaste aisa kar rahaa he
 Israel is insisting on taking drastic measures, including military action, while the US is trying to prevent Iran from making bombs by imposing diplomacy and sanctions
 obama ne ‘sibies’ samachar channel ko die ek saakshaatkaar main kaha ki vah netanyahu ke is baat se sahamat hai ki iran ko parmaanu hathiyaar nahin banane dena chahie, kyonki isse donon deshon or puure vishwa ke liye khatra utpann ho jayega or hathiyaaron ke liye daud shuru ho jaaegi

 pradhanmantri narendra modi saamaanya varg ke garibon ko aarakshan die jane kaa khub bakhaan kar rahe hai
 During a rally in Agra today, he said that our government has given reservation to the upper castes without stealing from dalit-adivasis or backward, but earlier the governments wanted to steal and appease
 lekin ek aisa video saamne aayaa he jiske mutabik gujarat kaa mukhyamantri rahete hue vah aarakshan ko vakt kii barbaadi maanate the
 He can be heard in the video available with Aaj Tak's youtube channel 'newstalk'
 isamen vah aarakshan ko vakt kii barbaadi bataa rahe hai
 In an interview, he is saying, 'if there is an education facility for everyone
 
 
 tab aarakshan ke liye koun poochhega? agar sabhi ke liye naukari ke liye mauka ho
 
 
 Then who will ask for reservation? Therefore we must create an era of prosperity
 ek baar ham samruddhi ke yug kaa nirmaan kar lenge to koi aarakshan kii baat nahin karegaa
 This is a waste of time
 isliye kyonki hamaara puraa arthtantr ek abhaav tantra he
 We have to convert less to more, and Gujarat is a model of prosperity
 lekin agra main aarakshan par bolte hue piem modi ne kaha, savarna garib pariwaron ko shaikshanik sansthaanon or sarkari sansthaanon main aarakshan ke liye ek mahatvapurn kadam uthaaya gaya he
 Earlier too, there was a lot of sloganeering during the election, i used to say that the government dishonestly says reservation above 50 per cent
 50 fisadi ke upar janaa he to samvidhan main sanshodhan ke bina nahin ja sakate
 Earlier, they used to steal the right of Dalit and Adivasi and wanted to fill the bag, so that their vote bank is filled
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki centre sarkaar rigerveshan dene ke liye samvidhan main sanshodhan laai or iske liye unhone sabhi saansadon kaa shukriya adaa kiya
 Poverty does not become a hindrance in anyone's development, so this reservation has been arranged
 sirf aarakshan hi nahin, uske saath ucch shiksha kii siten 10 fisadi badhaane kaa bhi nirnay liya gaya he
 However, let us know that this video available with newstalk was uploaded in 2013
 sarkari naukari or ucch shiksha sansthaanon main savarno ko 10 fisadi aarakshan dene ke liye samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak somvaar ko loksabhaa main paarit ho gaya
 The bill providing for 10% reservation has been supported by almost all parties

 According to the best traditions of democracy that day, both the opposing camps won
 ek ore jahaan anna hajaare ne apane urjapurna utsaah or spasht patibaddhta se raashtra ke dil par kabja kar liya, vahiin sansad ne bhi ek sahaspurn pradarshan se ise prerit kiya jisase yah phir se tay ho gaya ki agar uske sadasyon ko gadabad karne waalon kii bajaae uskaa sadsy hone kaa avasar diya jaataa to vah kis tarah kii sanstha ho sakati thi
 Team Anna and Parliament entered into a heated debate that promised an ombudsman, which could begin the huge task of cleaning up the stables of India's rotten power establishment
 lekin raat dhalane or subah hone ke baad ranbhumi par anischitata kaa ek lanbaa saaya padane laga
 Although it was understandable, people did not move from the ground
 in sabake bich ek visphotak sawaal haih kya us roj baaji maarane ke liye utaaru rajnatik partiyaan is shanti kaa istemaal prastaavit vidheyak ko bhulane, or badi chaturaai ke saath us sanstha ko khokhla banane ke liye kar sakati hai jise anna hajaare ne ekadam trutirahit banane kaa sochaa tha?27 agast ko sadan kii bhaavana kaa prastaav mej thapthapaakar paarit kar diya gaya, iske liye dhwani mat nahin karaayaa gaya jaisaa ki rivaaj he
 It has a built-in alternative to the government and Parliament's escape which could easily cause a furore with Team Anna's Lokpal Bill version
 prastaav main kaha gaya haih ''yah sadan nimna muddon par siddhanthata sahamat haih citigens charter, uchit vyavastha ke jariye nichle str kii naukarshahi ko bhi lokapal ke andar rakhaa jaae or rajyon main lokayukta bananaa
 The first "screw in details" is to "theoretically" insert the word
 iskaa matlab yah he ki sansad team anna kii teen maangon ko amali jama pehanaane ke maamle main patibaddh nahin he
 The second small screw is 'through proper system', which has been put in place before bringing the lower level bureaucracy under the purview of Lokpal
 duusare bindu bhi hai jinase team anna kaa vidheyak najuk ho saktaa he
 There is still no consensus in terms of bringing the Prime Minister under the Lokpal's purview, even though Team Anna believes, perhaps prematurely, that he has won this battle
 iske alaava yah vivaadaaspad mudda bhi he ki lokapal kii niyukti koun karegaa
 The question has not been answered as to whether the actions of mps within the House will be the subject of the Lokpal's inquiry - Hazare wants to hold them accountable, but the mps are not interested
 team anna chaahati he ki sibiai kaa bhrashtachar virdohi hissaa lokapal ke adheen ho
 Parliament may not allow this, but may give a separate team to the Lokpal and make the need of its employees the subject of government approval
 kya saansad raashtra se kiye gaye anna hajaare ke vaade ke saath bhitarghaat kar sakate hai? ab is vidheyak kaa bhagya congress saansad abhishek manu singhvi kii adhyakshata vaali kanoon evam nyaay par sansad kii sthaayee samiti ke hawaale he
 The Congress tried to show its honesty to Hazare's demands at a time when Manish Tiwari himself got out of this committee
 ludhiana se congress ke saansad tiwari ne pehle anna hajaare ko ''sir se paanv'' tak bhrasht bataaya or phir baad main iske liye khed jataate hue maafee maangi
 Another member of the committee, Amar Singh, against whom a charge sheet is to be filed in the vote-for-vote case, will also not participate in deliberations on the bill
 iske baavjood rajd pramukh lalu prasad yadav samet 31 sadasyon main kai log team anna ke sanskaran ko kamjor karne kaa prayaas karenge
 While civil society emerged as the winner after Hazare's fast, the civilized behavior of the mps also won

 The 2010 winter session came to an end as the government refused to succumb to the demand to form a joint parliamentary committee on the 2G scam
 sansad kii haisiyat gart main chali gai thi lekin lokapal par bahes ne uski chhavi sudhaar di
 There was an interesting debate in Parliament that day and mps from various parties intervened tremendously, giving a rude reply to the vulgar satire of actor Om Puri and activist Kiran Bedi
 puri or bedi ne ramlila maidan main saansadon ko ganvaar or anpadh bataate hue unka majaak udaaya tha
 Two mps who are proud of their rustic origins delivered a brilliant speech
 jad (you) saansad or rajg ke sanyojak sharad yadav ne kaha, ''ambedkar or mahatma gandhi jaise logon kii doordarshita ke bina mujh jaise logon ko apane jaanwaron ko bhi charaane ke liye dilli aane kii ijaajat nahin milti
 "but he gave advice to elderly Congress mps who seem to have been cut off from reality
" unhone siyasat ko viraasat main hasil karne kii bajaae jameen se judakar siyasat seekhney ke liye kaha
 Yadav asked, "just because someone's father is a leader, what is the idea of this generational change?" Lalu Prasad Yadav sternly warned Team Anna, "parliament is supreme and its authority cannot be understood 
 '' duusare saansadon ne zyada melmilaap vaala ravaiya apanaaya
 bjp's young MP, Varun Gandhi, tried to show seriousness by saying, "our duty is to express public opinion, not to give a verdict or abrogate it"
 ''congress saansad jyotiraditya sindhiya marathi main ek vaakya se hajaare kii ore bade
 Arun Jaitley maintained his fine form in Parliament and strengthened his identity as the bjp's strongest MP, saying, "one of the great strengths of Indian democracy is that we protest, we face crises, We struggle, but we have a tremendous sense of flexibility
 ham har sankat kaa samaadhaan nikaalane main asaadhaaran paripakvata dikhaate hai
 "team Anna should also be concerned with the interference of future Congress chief Rahul Gandhi in Parliament on 26 August
 rahul 27 agast ko mukhya bahes main shaamil nahin ho sake kyonki ve apni biimaar maa se milane chale gaye the
 Rahul's intervention was against the parliamentary tradition, which prohibited written speech during zero hour
 unke hastkshep kaa mukhya bindu thah ''bhartiya chunaav ayog kii tarah lokapal ko sansad ke prati javabdeh banaakar is bahes kaa darja kyon na uthaaya jaae or lokapal ko kyon na majboot banaaya jaae?'' rahul ke suzav ko der karne kii chaal mana ja rahaa he jabaki unhone ise khel badalane vaala bataaya tha
 Constitutional amendment is a long-running process as it requires the approval of Parliament and state legislatures, most of the time it is a difficult task
 unhone yah kehete hue team anna ke khilaaf sakhti dikhaai, ''nirvaachit sarkaar kii vyavastha se alag aisa nitigat hastkshep loktantr ke liye khatarnaak paripati banaata he jo sansad kii sarvocchata kii raksha ke liye bane upayon ko khatm karne kaa prayaas karata he
 This was in sharp contrast to the Prime Minister's eager urge to Hazare a day earlier
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne yah kehete hue unase anshan khatm karne kaa aagrah kiya tha, ''aapaki jindagi bahut keemtee he
 Sushma Swaraj, who supported the Prime Minister's appeal, criticized Rahul's speech

 The Prime Minister and Rahul's differences over the Lokpal were revealed in the House

 His lighter version was also aggressive for Team Anna

 He cautioned that the government should not make any promise which it could not fulfill

 The proposal was approved by Team Anna and the opposition before it was tabled in Parliament

 a Congress minister later admitted that he did not want to risk a voice vote as parties like JD (U), BSP and DMK did not support the Jan Lokpal Bill

 Politics and Parliament have come to the main stage at a time when there is increasing division in civil society about which version of Lokpal Bill is the best
 lokapal vidheyak ke vibhinn sanskarnon kii khoobiyon ke bare main 29 agast ko india today main ek golmes paricharchaa ke dauraan aruna raay ke netritv vaale neshnal campan for piples rhite tu information (ensipiarai), jiske sadsy arvind kejariwal bhi hai, ke pramukh sadsy nikhil de ne daleel di ki jan lokapal vidheyak kaa citigens charter, jise sansad vidheyak main shaamil karne ke liye raji hui, itnaa pechida he ki iklauta lokapal use sambhaal nahin saktaa
 Dey argues that grievance redress is separate from corruption and includes employment, food grains, health and education and delivery systems, among other government programs
 ensipiarai or team anna ke bich matbhed april main hajaare ke pehle anshan ke baad se hi bane hue hai
 Before that everyone was working together, debating the Jan Lokpal Bill together
 ensipiarai ke hi shekhar singh ne india today ke saamne isaki pushti kii
 "until April 4, we were discussing the Bill together," he said
 arvind kejariwal or prashanth bhushan, donon ensipiarai kii kaaryakari samiti ke sadsy hai
 According to Shekhar, differences arose over Hazare's decision to fast
 shekhar kehete hai, ''ham chaahate the ki jab tak ham baatcheet karke kuch matbhedon ko hal nahin kar lete tab tak anna hajaare anshan na karen
 When the fast came to an end on 9 April, Aruna Roy was not included in the drafting committee representing civil society
 india today ne kejariwal se aruna raay ko shaamil nahin kiye jane kaa kaaran poocha to unhone bataaya, ''sarkaar ko apni ore se arunaji kaa naam lenaa chahie tha, ve rashtriya salaahkaar parishad (enesi) kii sadsy hai
 Shekhar insists that not including Roy in the drafting committee is not a problem
 unka kahana he, ''samasya tab shuru hui jab unhone yah ravaiya apana liya ki jo jan lokapal vidheyak kaa samarthan nahin karte ve yaa to bhrasht hai yaa phir bhrashtachar ke samarthak hai
 His insistence that his version was correct and should be presented in Parliament was a problem for us
 ''ek varisht naagarik adhikaar kaaryakarta bataate hai, ''un sabaki apni chhavi, kshetra or daanv he, jisaki unhen raksha kerani he
 They are all vying to grab people's attention through media
 kabhi-kabhi is tarah ke halaat main mul mudda gaun ho jaataa he
 "some other members of civil society are questioning Team Anna's credibility
" arundhati raay, jo april main pehali baar lokapal kaa mudda uthne ke baad se hi aswabhaavik rup se khamosh hai, is andolan main ''vishwa bank kaa janaa-pahachaanaa agenda'' dekhati hai
 Rai is considered close to Bhushan
 ab ve kejariwal or kiran bedi par aise swayamsevi sanghathan chalaane kaa aarope laga rahi hai jinhen ford or rockfilor foundation se videshi funding milti he or is tarah ve in antarrashtriya swayamsevi sanghathanon kaa agenda chalaa rahe hai
 Harsh Mander, a member of the NAC led by Sonia Gandhi, has called the Jan Lokpal Bill a human made monster (frankenstein)
 mandar kehete hai, ''ve chaahate hai ki lokapal jaanchakarta, mukadmaa chalaane vaala or nyaayadhish ho
 it's very dangerous
 ''civil socity ke duusare tabakon se team anna ke jabardast virodh ko dekhte hue vah aasaani se vichlit ho sakati he
 But Kejriwal is determined not to let this happen
 ''ham arunaji (raay) kaa bahut sammaan karte hai
 There is hardly any difference between the Jan Lokpal Bill and the NCPRI version
 baatcheet se iskaa samaadhaan nikaala ja saktaa he
 "then he says with some desperation," all our attempts to start a conversation with him failed
 ''sansad kii sthaayee samiti team anna or civil socity kii duusari bemail awaajon ko sunegi
 It does not appear that the final version of the Lokpal Bill will be prepared according to the demands of Team Anna
 lekin agar unki maangon se zyada alag hatakar vidheyak banegaa to team anna ke bare main mana jayega ki unhone bharat ke logon se kiya gaya vaada tod diya

 is shaks ne aisa sirf isliye kiya kyonki diwaali kaa sijan he or uske paas order zyada tha, isliye uske paas patni ke antim sanskaar ke liye vakt nahin tha
 The wife lay on the bed of Keelash and this man continued to do his work

 The police reached the spot after being informed

 During interrogation, Rajaram told that his wife had died three days before but he was making the goods with the advance of Diwali
 isaki vajah se uske paas patni ke antim sanskaar ke liye vakt nahin tha
 According to Rajaram, he would perform the last rites of his wife only after the supply of the order was fully supplied
 hairaani kii baat he ki rajaraam teen din tak usee kamare main sota rahaa jahaan bistar par patni kaa shav padaa tha
 According to SP (yamunapar) Ashok Kumar, the way Rajaram behaved, it seems that he is mentally ill
 lekin sawaal ye bhi he ki wo patni kii maut ke baad bhi bataashe banane kaa apana kaam karata rahaa
 In the materialist era, man has become so insensitive that the craze of business happened for him even before the death of his wife

 On the issue of corruption, the government will bow down to Anna in such a way that it will not be proud of the government itself and the reason is Team Anna
 ji haa civil sosayadi se ek or shaks judaa he jo media kii nabz ko achche se jaanata he or uskaa naam he manish sitaudiya
 Sisodia also has an important role in Anna's decisions
 aaj anna kaa andolan media main chaaya hua he to shaayad uski vajah manish sisodiya hi hai kyonki manish sitaudiya ek tivi patrkaar rah chuke hai or tivi par chhaae rahane ke gur unase behatar anna ko koun bataa saktaa he?manish sitaudiya artiai, yani rhite tu information se jude hue hai

 Manish Sisodia is also associated with Kejriwal with Parivartan Sanstha, ie when to do what is to be done to root out corruption, and especially how to remain in the media, these Sisodia is well aware and how Anna and the movement should remain in such Sisodia's advice behind this in the headlines cannot be ignored

 unhone kai baar apni yah jimmedaari bakhubi nibhaai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, calling him a veteran politician and said that he was an outspoken leader, who had expertise in intellectual and legal fields
 vahiin party adhyaksh or grahamantri amit shah ne kaha ki arun jetali ke nidhan se hue nuksaan kii bharpai jaldi nahin ho sakati
 Amit Shah also described the death of Arun Jaitley as a personal loss
 jetali ke nidhan ko bijepi ke kai netaa party hi nahin apni nijee kshati ke taur par bataate hai
 The reason is that Jaitley was ahead in helping the leaders personally during the time of crisis
 apane raajnneetik kariyar ke dauraan arun jetali bijepi main kai bhoomikaaon main rahe
 Instead of being confined to the posts, he continued to carry out all kinds of responsibilities
 kaha ja rahaa he ki bijepi ke liye arun jetali kaa vikalp dhundhna naammumkin to nahin magar mushkil jarur he
 1-who will set the party's narrator like Jaitley Arun Jaitley always set the bjp's narrator
 khud bijepi netaa or kendriya mantri nitin gadakari bhi is baat ko maanate hai
 Nitin Gadkari says that Arun Jaitley played an important role in setting the bjp's narrative among intellectuals

 2- The true crisis is the matter of the BJP or of the party leaders, whenever the crisis comes, Arun Jaitley used to stand in front of him to overcome it

 Bijpi was once considered a politically untouchable party in the 90s
 vajah ki congress kii tulana main bijepi se duusare raajnneetik dal dooriyaan banaakar chalate the
 But Vajpayee broke this notion by bringing together several parties under the umbrella of NDA
 bijepi ko sweekaaryata dilaai
 Arun Jaitley is said to have been one of the craftsmen of the NDA
 apane udaaravaadi chehre or jepi andolan se judaav hone kii vajah se duusare dalon ke netaaon se achche sambandhon ke chalate vah endie ke gathan main ahm bhoomika nibhaane main safal rahe
 At times, Arun Jaitley continued to help BJP in coordinating with the opposition on important issues
 5-kushal ranneetikaar, chunaav managerayah alag baat he ki arun jetali hameshaa rajyasabha ke jariye sansad jate rahe
 He fought the Lok Sabha elections from Amritsar in 2014 for the first time in life

 He played an important role in preparing the manifesto of BJP in every election
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main prachaar campan kii unhone kaman sanbhali
 It was he who decided in 2014 that the slogan of Modi government and not BJP would be given in the election posters

 Because in the internal survey conducted by BJP, Modi's immense popularity was revealed among the public

 The train accident near Muzaffarnagar on Saturday evening has raised many important questions related to railway safety in a single blow
 haadase ke baad get main kaa jo audio tepe saamne aayaa he, usamen wo bataa rahaa he ki patari railway karmchaariyon ne hi kaati thi lekin vakt rahete, use jod nahin sake, isiilie itnaa bada haadasa hua
 Similar to this claim of the Gate Man, people who have trained about five hundred railway apprentices sitting on a dharna at Jantar Mantar in Delhi for the last ten days are also saying

 With this demand, these boys have been protesting at Jantar Mantar for the last ten days
 bina training ke kaam kar rahe karmcharibatcheet ke dauraan kai ladakon ne yah daawa kiya ki yah haadasa trek par bina training ke kaam kar rahe karmchaariyon kii vajah se hua he
 He told that the contractors bring in the workers and get them done, who are not fully aware of the safety to be adopted while working on the train track
 agar vahaan prashikshit log hote to patari kholane se pehle wo usase kuch duuri par, donon taraf ek board lagaate jis par ‘saavdhaan’ likhaa hota
 Put a red flag so that even if a train comes, the driver knows that he has to reduce or stop the speed of the train

 These boys say that instead of getting cheap work done, the railways should worry about the safety of the passengers and should employ only trained people like them

 abaki baar gaanv main mahila-purush donon kii seat ai
 Durgavati was about to contest again, but backed out
 unki jagah unke devar narayan singh patel ne chunaav ladaa or jeet bhi gaye

 narayan bole- chunaav nahin ladanaa chaahati thongreji akhbaar indian express ne sutron ke hawaale se daawa kiya he ki durgavati par chunaav na ladane ke liye paariwarik dabaav tha
 When asked about this, Narayan said - My sister-in-law Kidilchaspi is no longer in politics

 Narayan, 56, won by only 18 votes on Sunday
 ab tak vah durgavati ke pratinidhi ke taur par kaam kar rahe the or pradhani kaa kaam bhi dekh rahe the
 People said - Durgavati had filled the nomination
 Local people say that Durgavati was contesting the election
 unhone nomination paper tak bhar diya tha, lekin paariwarik dabaav ke kaaran file nahin kar pain
 But Narayan states that there are two reasons for this
 'ek- yah sahi he ki chunaav ladane main unki bahut dilchaspee nahin rah gai thi
 Secondly, he was afraid that some people will oppose him on some issues of local politics and he is not even well-written
 aisi sthiti main unhone mujhe chunaav ladane ko kaha
 'but Durgavati could not be talked about
 Akhbar has claimed that he tried hard to talk to Durgavati about the matter of pressure, but could not talk to him

 View this post on Instagram CULTURAL APPROPRIATION? 
 
 
 According to our basic birthright source, Wikipedia, the wearing & displaying of such headdresses, and other ‘indigenous traditional arts and sacred objects’ by those who have not earned them — especially by non-natives as fashion or costume — is considered extremely offensive by traditional Native people
 The 'controversy' is part of a wider effort by Native American activists to highlight the ongoing cultural genocide against indigenous peoples (especially in the United States and Canada)
 The stupid trend of musicians and festival-goers wearing warbonnets across festivals has led to criticism by Native Americans, apologies by non-natives, and the banning of headdresses as costumes by several big-league music festivals
 We thought this was common knowledge
 Yet, we are here, talking about it being appropriated by a celebrity calendar

 Do you know when the first selfie stick was invented? Even though it has been in trend for the last few years, Hiroshi Ueda invented it only in 1980

 " wain dwaara viksit selfi stick ko khub kharida gaya, lekin usee dizin se saste stick banaakar duusari companiyaan bhi khub kamai karne lagi hai

section 144 has been implemented in jodhpur main 31 april tak ke liye dhara 144 lagu kar di gai he
 Due to this, the court will be put in jail
 As soon as the court's decision came on 7 April, the Vasundhara Raje government of Rajasthan, without delay, appealed to the High Court in the Rajasthan High Court that the decision on the Asaram case should be pronounced by putting a court inside the jail
 darasal vasundhara sarkaar ko dar he ki asaram ke khilaaf faisla aane kii sthiti main asaram ke samarthak rajya main arajak sthiti na khadi kar den
 Also, if Asaram is convicted and sentenced, a violent situation like Panchkula can occur in Jodhpur
 apni apil ke peeche vasundhara sarkaar ne hoicourt ke saamne intelligence report pesh kii
 This apprehension has been received in the Intelligence report, in fact, intelligence agencies have received such information that if a decision against Asaram comes, then thousands of his supporters can create a ruckus
 intelligence report ke mutabik, is baat kii puri ashanka he ki jodhpur main aam jan-jivan buree tarah prabhavit ho saktaa he evam shanti vyavastha bighad sakati he tathaa asaram ke samarthak hinsa kar sakate hai or kanoon vyavastha ke saamne chunauti khadi kar sakate hai
 This can cause major damage to public property and there is a possibility of loss of life and property
 bari ho gaye phir bhi jail main hi rahenge asaramvasundhara sarkaar kii apil or intelligence report ko dhyaan main rakhte hue rajasthan hoicourt ne jodhpur essi / asti court ko nirdesh diya ki asaram maamle main faisla jodhpur central jail ke andar hi court banaakar sunaaya jaae, jahaan asaram band he
 If you want to visit Baba Barfani this year, you will have to stay away from alcohol for at least one month and exercise continuously
 amarnath shrin board ne yatra ko lekar yah adwijuri kii he
 It says that since the cave of Amarnath is at a very high altitude, the visitors should make a habit of walking five kilometers every day for a month
 adwijuri main likhaa gaya he ki tahalne kii aadat ke saath-saath shwasan prakriya par bhi dhyaan dene kii jarurat he, isiilie darshan ke icchhuk sabhi logon ko shwasan sambandhi vyaayaam bhi karnaa chahie
 The comments is saal amarnath yatra 29 june se shuru hokar 7 agast tak chalegi
 The holy cave is situated at an altitude of 14000 feet, due to which the travelers can face difficulty in breathing
 isliye unhen isliye unhen oxigen kaa chota silinder saath main rakhana chahie
 Due to altitude problem, due to lack of timely treatment, there is a fear of paralysis, loss of eyesight and in a few hours it can prove to be fatal
 yatra ke dauraan sharaab, dhumrapaan or caffeinayus peya padaarth nahin pine kii bhi hidaayat di gai he
 The registration process for the journey has started
 amarnath yatra kii suraksha is saal agenciyon ke liye ek badi chunauti hogi
 Last year, despite all the promises, vehicles of Amarnath pilgrims were pelted in the valley
 saath hi ghati main jaruri saamaan le jane vaale trek chaalkon par bhi hamale kiye
 The yatra was halted for two days after the terrorist Burhan Wani was killed last year
 iske baad yatra behaal to jarur hui, lekin yatra par iskaa nirantar asar dikhaa
 This was the reason that the yatra was reduced to a figure of 2 lakh 20 thousand devotees
 is saal baba barphani kaa aakaar bada hone kii ummid he
 This year, the Amarnath Yatra will start from June 29 to August 7
 pavitra gupha 14000 foot kii oonchai par sthit he, jiske chalate yatriyon ko saans lene main kathinaayee kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 So they should therefore keep them together with a small cylinder of oxygen
 oonchai sambandhi dikkat hone par samay se ilaaj na milane se lakva maarane, ankhon kii roshni jane kaa dar hota he or kuch hi ghante main yah jaanaleva sabit ho saktaa he
 Alcohol, smoking and caffeinated beverages are also advised not to drink during the trip
 yatra ke liye registration kii prakriya shuru ho chuki he
 The security of the Amarnath Yatra will be a major challenge for the agencies this year
 pichley saal tamaam vaadon ke baavjood ghati main amarnath yatriyon ke vaahanon par patharav kiya gaya tha
 Also attacked truck drivers carrying essential goods in the valley
 pichley saal aatanki burhan vaani ke maare jane ke baad do din tak yatra ko roak diya gaya tha
 After this, the journey was definitely restored, but it showed a continuous impact on the journey
 yahi kaaran tha ki yatra 2 lakh 20 hajaar shraddhaluon ke aankade tak simat gai
 This year Baba Barfani is expected to grow in size

 The first case was filed by Gopal Singh Visharad in 1950, demanding a permanent ban on the removal of idols from the birthplace
 ye cese faijabad kii jila adaalat main daakhil hue or phir hycourt main chale
 The appeal was made to the Supreme Court directly after the Allahabad High Court's decision in the Janmabhoomi case
 1959 main nirmohi akhaade ne prabandhan or puja kaa adhikaar maangate hue cese kiya
 The Sunni Waqf Board in its case in 1961 sought ownership and possession
 1989 main ramalala virajman kii taraf se cese daakhil hua
 3 parts: High Court verdict On September 30, 2010, a three-judge bench of the Allahabad High Court gave its verdict
 bahumat se die faisle main ram janmabhumi ko teen baraabar hisson me baantne kaa aadesh tha
 Where Ramlala sits, he gave that part to Ramlala
 doosraa hissaa nirmohi akhaade ko or teesraa hissaa musalamaanon ko diya gaya
 a judge gave the entire land to Ramlala and dismissed the remaining cases

 Siddiq-lawyer Rajeev Dhawan, Meenakshi Arora, Jiraha at birthplace-zafaryab Jilani, Nizamuddin Pashaham on Islamic beliefs The important link in the ASI Reporterram Janmabhoomi case is the excavation report of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI)
 ees ne hycourt ke aadesh par khudaai kii thi
 According to the report, just below the disputed structure, a large structure was found which resembles the temples of North India
 yahaan 10veen shatabdi se lekar dhaancha banaae jane tak lagaataar nirmaan hua
 The remains of statues and other things dating back to the 10th Vedic period have been found before the 10th century
 supreme court ne kaha ki ees kii report koi saadhaaran raay nahin he
 The excavation took place at the behest of the High Court judge
 supreme court main hindu pakshabhagwan naaballig maane jate hai or naaballig kii sampatti chhini nahin ja sakati
 Rama's birthplace is the deity itself, it cannot be transferred
 6 disambar, 1992 ko jo dhaancha dhahaaya gaya, use islamic kanoon ke mutabik masjid nahin mana ja saktaa
 The essential condition for the mosque is that it should be the owner of the land, while Babur was not the owner
 vah kabhi ayodhya nahin gaya
 The mosque does not contain any type of idol, picture or living thing or animals, flowers, leaf idols etc
 whereas the birthplace had idols of the gods
 ees kii khudaai main mili avshesh bhi vahaan mandir hone kii pushti karte hai
 a huge temple-like structure is found beneath the disputed structure
 khudaai main kalash, camel or devi-devataaon kii murtiyon thim jisase sabit hota he ki vahaan pehle mandir tha jise todakar masjid banaai gai or mandir kii saamagree kaa prayog masjid banane me hua
 Hindus worship trees, mountains, sun, river, all and consider them gods
 duniya main khoje gaye sabase chote kan ko bhi god partical kaha gaya he
 Lord Rama was born there, so the place itself is a deity and should be considered as a judicial person
 bhagwaan ram ne ayodhya main hi janm liya tha or usee jagah ram janmasthan he yah sabit karne ke liye aitihaasik, dastaveji or puratathvik saboot pesh kiye gaye
 For the first time in the 19th century, seven foreigners were called Babri Masjid
 isse pehle babari masjid kahe jane ke dastaveji saboot nahin hai
 The Muslim side is saying that if there was Idgah, then the mosque was built by breaking the Idgah
 ayodhya me bahut-si masjiden hai, janmasthan badla nahin ja saktaa
 The Supreme Court did not have a huge temple under the Muslim structure
 babar ne mandir todakar masjid nahin banaai thi
 Hindus attacked the mosque in 1934, they forcibly entered in 1949, demolished the mosque in 1992 and now they are pleading with the court to protect the rights
 bhagwaan ram kii ore se pehali baar cese 1989 main daayar hua, jisamen puri jameen par malikana haq maanga gaya
 The deity is a judicial person but cannot contest the case himself
 jab nirmohi akhaada sevadaar kii haisiyat se maujuud he to phir alag cese kaa koi matlab nahin
 Panchkosi and fourteen Kosi parikrama in Ayodhya cannot be considered evidence
 videshi yatriyon or itihaaskaaron ke dbrayore suni-sunai baton par aadhaarit
 Several layers have been found in ASI excavations
 alag-alag avasheshon ko ek saath mila kar nahin dekha ja saktaa
 Mixing the remains together cannot be said that there was a massive structure under the structure
 ees ne apaaramparik takanic se khudaai kii
 It is wrong to call ruins as temples
 vahaan idgah thi
 This report is expert opinion and not evidence
 camel kaa phool or anya chitra sajaavat ke liye hai
 It cannot be called against Islam
 hindu paksh sabit kare ki 22-23 disambar, 1949 (jab andar murtiyon rakhi gayi thi) ke pehle unka vahaan kya adhikaar tha
 Nirmohi Akhara used to worship on the platform outside, not inside
 andar musalamaanon kaa adhikaar
 It is unfair to make the birthplace a deity and a judicial person
 aisa hoga to baaki pakshon or dharmik vishwaas rakhane waalon ke adhikaar khatm ho jaaenge
 In favor of the claim of Babri Masjid, the papers of the Imam's salary and the repair and compensation of some broken parts of the mosque in the 1934 riots were kept in the court
 babar samprabhu shaasha tha or court uske kaam kaa vishleshan nahin kar saktaa
 The sovereign ruler is the owner of the land and his work cannot be called illegal
 hycourt ke faisle ke khilaaf apil or daleelhindu pakshaucch nyaayalay ne ye to mana ki vivaadit bhoomi main vah hissaa shaamil he jise ram janmasthan mana jaataa he lekin puja kaa adhikaar nahin diya
 This is contradictory
 murti hataane par sthai roak lagaae bagaiyr puja kaa adhikaar bemaani
 It violated the right to religious freedom
 hindu puri bhoomi ko devtaa maanate hai or devtaa par bantwaare kaa niyam nahin lagu hoga
 The majority decision of the High Court to distribute the land is against the concept of the deity given in various decisions of the Supreme Court
 muslim pakshailahabaad hycourt ne mukhya gumbad ke neeche bhagwaan ram kaa janmasthan kaha he jabaki iskaa koi subut nahin tha
 It is incorrect to say that since the first decades of 1949, there was a joint occupation of both Hindus and Muslims in the mosque complex
 ees report main kahin yah nahin kaha gaya ki mandir dhahaakar masjidbanai gai
 The High Court failed to understand that Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution gave equal protection to the faith and faith of all people
 malikana haq aasthaa or vishwaas ke aadhaar par tay nahin ho saktaa
 Shia Waqf Board in support of Hindus The Uttar Pradesh Shia Central Waqf Board openly supported the trial of Hindus in the Supreme Court
 board ne kaha ki hindu devtaa kanoon kii nigaah main kanoonee vyakti hote hai lekin allaah kanoonee vyakti nahin hote
 How can the Sunni Waqf Board claim adverse possession when Allah is not a judicial person

 In one of the chapters of the book Tumultuous Times: India in Australia, November 1999 – January 2000, Sachin wrote, i had high expectations from Kapil Dev

 The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was beginning to appear comfortable in Bihar since the announcement of Lok Sabha elections dates after Nitish Kumar returned in 2017
 40 loksabhaa siton vaale is rajya main 2019 main kuchhek siton ko chhodkar sabhi par dotarafa muqabla hua
 This was the reverse of 2014 when Nitish kumar-cpi, congress-rashtriya Janata dal-ncp and bjp-led NDA contested separately and against each other
 rajd-congress ko 2014 main milakar 29 fisadi vot mili the
 In this context, the two-way contest was not easy for the NDA
 lekin rajya main 39 siten jitkar endie ne rajd kii aguai vaale gathbandhan ko karaari haar di he
 What struck this coalition was the popularity of its main leaders — Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar — and the ability of Ram Vilas Paswan to maintain his 7-8 per cent vote bank
 up-mukhyamantri susheel modi kehete hai, ''hamane is dauraan jabardast badhat banaae rakhi
 In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the NDA had an 11 percent lead over the rjd-congress alliance
 2019 main nitish ji ke endie main hone kii vajah se hamaari badhat main ijapha hona tay tha
 Nitish contested the 2014 Lok Sabha elections against the NDA and except for that one election, he has won the election in whatever coalition he has been in
 yahaan tak ki 2014 main bhi jab jad(you) keval do siten jeet sakaa tha, usne apni 16 fisadi vot hissedari banaae rakhi thi
 The party's vote share rose to 21 this time, despite the Banbastan contesting on fewer seats (17 in 2019 compared to 37 in 2017)
 58 fisadi par pahunch gai
 The results will show that the Chief Minister has managed to get his votes to the coalition candidates
 votaron kaa shukriya adaa karte hue nitish ne kaha, ''hamane jan samarthan kii apil kii thi or modi ji ne jis tarah centre main kaam kiya he or hamane jis tarah pichley 13 saal main bihar main kaam kiya he, us par vichaar karte hue unase vot maange the
 People have given us the mandate
 ab hamaari jimmedaari or bhi bad gai he
 On the other hand, the Grand Alliance was left with its wounds
 congress ne nau siton par chunaav ladaa or gathbandhan ke liye mahaj ek seat jeet saki
 The RJD could not even open its account
 mahagathbandhan kii is haalat ke pich kai vajahen hai
 The most prominent among them is the absence of Lalu Prasad, who could not campaign because of his jail sentence
 mahagathbandhan main jithan ram maanjhi kii hindustan avam party, upendra kushvaha kii rashtriya lok samta party or mukesh sahani kii vikasshil insaan party bhi thi
 The strategy of social expansion was behind bringing these leaders into the coalition, but in two-way competition it could not be equal to the NDA

 This decision of the court will provide great relief to those farmers who were unable to use the vehicles which had been stopped after the ban for farming

 In this two-day meeting, an important decision may be taken to reduce the repo rate
 haalanki monetry policy kamity kii taraf isamen kami karne kii gunjaaish kam hi dikhti he
 This is because of the challenges faced by the economy in the past
 kamity ke saamne maujuuda samay main 3 ahm chunautiyaan hai, jinase nipatakar uske liye repo rate main kami karne kaa faisla lenaa mushkil ho saktaa he
 Inflation The first challenge facing RBI Monetary Policy is inflation

 aise main arabiai ke saamne mahangaai badhane kii chunauti he

 In such a situation, if the RBI cuts the rate, then the attitude of foreign investors can prove to be worse for the stock market

 Rise in crude oil prices: The Reserve Bank of India will have to take a decision to reduce the repo rate keeping crude oil prices in mind
 pichley kuch dinon se kachche tel kii keemten badi hai
 Rising crude oil prices have an effect on inflation
 aise main monetry policy kamity koi bhi faisla lene se pehle, is par jarur gaur karegi
 The possibility of a repo rate cut is unlikely due to a rise in inflation and a lack of favorable environment for the economy
 aise main dekhnaa hoga ki do din chalane vaali is baithak main kya faisla saamne aata he

 In the midst of China's Dadagiri on the Sikkim border, the 'aaj Tak' team has taken stock of the situation along the border of China adjacent to Tibet in Uttarakhand
 seemaant chamoli jile kaa mana sarhad kaa aakhri gaanv he
 There are 3 passes to reach Tibet from Chamoli district, next to Neeti, Mana and Barahoti
 1962 kii jang se pehle ye bharat or tibet ke bich kaa kaarobaar kaa rasta tha
 Mana has units of Army and ITBP while ITBP has a forward post 40 to 50 km ahead of Mana
 haalanki pichley kai saalon se mana ke ilaake main china kii taraf se ghuspaith kii koi koshish nahin hui lekin itibipi or sena koi mauka nahin dena chaahati
 ITBP personnel are stationed on high mountains ranging from 8,000 to 18,000 feet in Leh to Mana, Sikkim and Arunachal
 aise main itibipi ke himaviron ko mountain warfere ke liye hameshaa taiyaar rahanaa hota he
 On this occasion, we have to know how the jawans remain alert at the border in adverse conditions
 mana main itibipi ke javaanon kii petroling or khaas mountain warfare training karai jaati he
 This special training is provided in the itbp's Mountaineering and Sking Institute located in Joshimath near Mana
 70 fit oonchi sidhi khadi chattan par chadhakar dushman ke khilaaf kisi karrwai ko anjaam dena itibipi ke jawan ke baayen haath kaa khel he
 With the help of a knot ropeway, the youngsters climb on a high rock
 is khaas training ke shaareerik or maansik taur par majboot hona bahut jaruri he
 ITBP personnel are stationed at dozens of forward posts in Mana, Niti, Malari and Barahoti in Chamoli district
 kai post tak pahunchane ke liye 6 se 8 kilometre paidal janaa hota he
 However, over the years, the work of constructing a strategic road in these areas has increased
 itibipi ke jawan pahaado par petroling karke china kii har harakat par najar rakhte hai
 a contingent of 10 soldiers, armed with weapons and necessary equipment, proceed through the high rocks
 chamoli jile ke badahoti main isi saal 3 june 2017 ko china ke 2 helicopter ghusane ke baad hadakamp much gaya tha
 This Chamoli area is located near the india-china border

 According to officials, both helicopters remained in the Indian border for about 5 minutes
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki unhone bhartiya ilaakon kii photography bhi kii he, aise main ho saktaa he ki vah bhartiya post kii nigaraanee karne aae hon
 Barahoti is a sloping meadow on the Tibet border on the Malari valley in Chamoli district

 a motorway has now been built up to Somna
 somna se badahoti lagbhag 6 kilometre he, is maidan se ek kilometre peeche rimakhim main bharat-tibet seemaa police tainaat he
 When we reached Tibet via Niyal Valley via Gyaldhung, it was found that here too, a road has been constructed up to 6 km back from the border
 mana or niti ke raste tibet pahunchnaa kathin he
 But it is easiest to go to Tibet and Kailash Mansarovar via tun-jhin-la via Barahoti
 1962 ke bharat-china yuddh se pehle sabase adhik vyapaaree badahoti hote hue tibet jate the
 This route is not only out of the 3 passes of Chamoli but is the nearest way to reach Mansarovar from any pass in the country
 haal main china ne sikkim ke raste maansarovar kii yatra ko bhi roak diya tha
 The route to Barahoti near Mana is the nearest and simplest route to Mansarovar
 lekin vivaadit hone se tun-jhin-laa se na to vyapaar or na hi maansarovar yatra maarg khul rahaa he
 By this route, Kailash Mansarovar can be reached in one day while from Pithoragarh it takes 6 days

 Rakshabandhan is a festival of brotherly affection
 rakshabandhan ke maukey par jahaan bahanen apane bhai kii kalai par raksha sutara baandhakar unase apni raksha karne kaa vachan le rahi hai
 At the same time, in Munger, Bihar, the police is doing Gandhigiri by tying the defense thread on the hands of the two wheelers
 rakshabandhan ke din munger kii sadakon kaa najaara hi kuch alag rahaa
 Police has gathered everywhere
 do pahiyaa vaahan chalaane waalon ko roka ja rahaa he or police ke adhikari unke haathon menraksha sutarabaandh dete hai
 At first glance, the drivers of the vehicle are afraid that there is no checking at all, but after the defense thread is tied on the wrist, it is known that it is becoming Gandhigiri
 police gandhigiri isliye kar rahi he ki do pahiyaa vaahan chalaate vakt helmet kaa prayog avashya karen
 Munger's Defense Superintendent Ashish Bharti and Jamalpur Rail SP Swapna Meshram jointly carried out the program on the streets of Munger
 munger or jamalpur main binahelmetvahan chalaane waalon kii sankhya main kami nahin aane ke kaaran gandhigiri ko in donon police ke adhikariyon ne apnaane kaa nirnay liya
 The thinking of both of them was that the work that cannot be done on the basis of rules and law can be carried out by explaining it with the help of Gandhigiri
 polisake is kadam kii vaahan chaalkon ne bhi saraahna kii or aage se helmet pahanakar hi vaahan chalaane kii kasame khai
 Railway Minister Piyush Goyal said in an interview given to Business Standard on 18 June 2018 last year that the GDP rate will be 10 percent in the last quarter of 2019
 uske baad isi saal 5 farvari ko iconomic times se piyush goyal ne kaha tha ki vitt varsh 20 main 7
 It is expected to be 5 percent GDP
 ek saal main piyush goyal ne khud hi jidipi main 2
 Reduced by 5 percent
 asli jidipi to or 2
 Reduced by 5 percent
 yani jitna ek saal pehle kaha uskaa aadha ho gaya
 Anyone seen 10 percent GDP in the last quarter of 2019? 5 in the first quarter of 2020
 jidipi aaj 5 he to kal 7 ho sakati he lekin bayanon se kaise logon ko bandar banaaya ja rahaa he aap khud dekh sakate hai
 Similarly, look at the statements given about GDP at the time of demonetisation
 us samay doorgaami parinaam ke naam par jo bhi kaha gaya puraa nahin hua
 What happened a little for a short time could have happened without demonetisation
 puri koshish hi yahi hoti he ki aaj kii hedline manage karo
 Talk big so that people are constantly in false hope
 ummid ke naam par apane karnaamon par pardaa daalo
 Now no one will ask what are the chances of 10 percent GDP coming in
 Earlier, Goyal Saheb was drawing graphics charts
 paanch pratishat ko lekar bhi chart bana dete
 Now that his team will not make or make any chart then how to prove that we are ahead of China
 china ke fel karne se bharat ko topper bataa rahe hai
 You all forget zaahir si baat he
 But go back a little and see what they say
 maine yahaan par pradhanmantri or piyush goyal ke puraane twit ke kuch screen shats lagaae hai

 The 80-year-old Murdoch, who stepped onto British soil with his own unique approach to dealing with the crisis, changed his entire outlook after the controversy spread beyond Britain and threatened to spread to the global media empire
 murdoch ne prarambh main rebeka brooks kaa samarthan kiya jo unke britain kii parichaalan pramukh or ab band ho chuke news of da world teblide kii purv sampadak thi
 The phone of murdered teenager Millie Dowler was hacked while she was his editor
 lekin murdoch ne apana najariya badalte hue kal rebeka brooks ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 Les Minton, another top associate of Murdoch and chief executive of the Dow Jones Group, has resigned
 vah 1995 se 2007 news international ke pramukh rahe or unhone rupert murdoch ke saath paanch dashak se zyada samay tak kaam kiya tha
 Hinton is the most senior officer to leave this media empire
 unhone apane bayaan main kaha ki jo kuch bhi hua uski unhen jaankaree nahin thi lekin vah mahasoos karte hai ki istipha dena uchit hoga
 In an advertisement published today, Murdoch said, "we apologize for the grave mistake that happened
" 
 
 
 i feel that simply apologizing is not enough
 hamaara vyavsaay is vichaar par aadhaarit he ki swatantra or mukt press samaaj main ek sakaaratmak shakti hona chahie
 We need to complete it

 John Presscott, a former deputy prime minister and a staunch critic of Murdoch's business methods, said nothing has changed with his apology and that it has been sought because lawmakers will ask questions about his record next week
