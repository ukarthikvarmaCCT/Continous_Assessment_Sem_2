 "our country, my dress, my fruits", Irene continued to cook coffee
 main cigarette peetaa-peetaa muskaraata rahaa
 i did not answer
 uttar dene kii jarurat bhi nahin thi
 i kept trying to understand Irene
 maan-baap kya itane rupye chhod gaye hai ki irine itani shandaaree se teen bahanon or ek bhai or beyaron or naukaraaniyon ko paal rahi he? kamare ke furniture behad khubasurat or letest dizin kii in khidakiyon main jhulate hue parde keemtee japani hand print ke hai
 There are original paintings on the walls, and the paintings reveal Irene's tastefulness
 farsh par parsian carpet he
 There is a piano-set in one corner
 duusare kone main radiogram
 There is a drawingroom and is beautiful and adorned like a European princess returning from church after marriage
 "ye paintings aapako achche lage? saamne vaali to study maitisi kii he

 Things came to sculpture from painting

 Irene said- "suddenly i had a conversation with you on the phone, and how close we have come to this very first meeting
 "maine anubhav kiya, ham donon vaaki najadik aa gaye hai
 She had sat on my own couch, sipping coffee, and plunged into philosophy
 mujhe auraton ke munh se philasphi acchhee nahin lagati he, kavita acchhee lagati he
 i said- "elliott wrote, We don't know each other, But let's pretend, But let's pretend
" ""or, ejra pound ne likhaa he, dont pritend, and lats bilive it, lats dissive ich adar, and dont dissive it
 "irene stopped and said to me in soft, silk-like, and instantly open cloud-like virgin accents, and looked down at her half-finished cup of coffee
 pyaalaa khaali ho gaya
 Not only once, slowly the cup became empty, and my fear started increasing
 meraa bhay badhane laga, or cameraa baari hota gaya
 The weight of everything in the room started increasing
 chaandi kii nangi ladki or gulab se surkh-surkh phool or japani print ke parde or deevaaron par faili cubic tasviren
 Then, i said that i do not like meditation, i like cleanliness and cleanliness
 saadagi mujhe bahut pyaari he
 i hate lipstick and 'kick'-makeup
 main buddhi or bauddhikta se lagaav rakhata hoon
 i like Brahms more than Beethoven and Mozart
 mujhe byran nahin chahie, milton chahie
 i don't want Milton either, want Rabindranath
 tumi je tumii ogo, sei tav rin
 Ami peacock pyar diya shudhi forever or, irine ne kaha ki use rabindra sangeet se pyaari or koi chiz nahin lagati he, or khaas avasaron ke alaava vah lipistic nahin lagaati
 Does not make up bas, juude main motiyaa yaa bela yaa gulab yaa champa ke chaar phool daal leti he
 And put a small sapphire or diamond or emerald in the neck
 silk se use nafrat he, zyaadaatar khaadi yaa handloom pahenti he
 And, his own poets are Goethe and Dante
 ‘abndon aal hopes, ye hu anter hiyar’, aisa dante ke indernon ke daravaaje par likhaa he
 And, Irene said that the example of Shakuntala's dance cannot be found
 ramgopal or udaishankar jaise log tarif karte nahin thakte
 But Shakuntala says, will not become professional
 shauk he, bas! or lilian? sangeet main uske praan basate hai
 Tired of writing radio addresses, Lillian does not go to deliver programs

 There will never be an airplane, or maybe, Shilu will keep flying in the sky day and night
 sirf main hi koi shauk nahin paalati
 Just, i keep reading books day and night and keep wondering why the people of my country are breaking their culture
 "beyara waapas aayaa or trey uthaakar chalaa gaya
 Irene snatched a rose from the silver girl's hand, and kept fingering it on the petals
 ek-do pattey tut gaye
 i lit the last cigarette of my packet
 maine kaha, "phir aapane itani maamuli si naukari ke liye aplication kyon diya he? aapako pataa he, aap ko kul teen sau rupye maas milenge? aapane mujhe bekaar apane yahaan bulaayaa, bekaar mujhase parichay kiya

 mujhe vishwaas he, aap khud bhi itani sasti naukari sweekaar nahin karengi
 i am sorry
 "miss irine ne apni baari or badi-badi palken uthaakar meri ore dekha
 Then, the eyelids fell
 phir, ve gulab ke phool ko dekhati raheen, jisaki pankhudiyaan farsh par bikhar chuki thim
 Then, they kept looking at the silver girl due to not being polished, whose body was stained everywhere
 phir, ve muskaraayi
 This smile was not the smile of the hotel receptionist
 yah muskuraahat mere liye aparichit thi
 It was a very clean, very naked, and very sharp smile
 irine kaa juda khul gaya tha, or lambey bal chehre ke donon taraf fail aae the, ceiling fain kii tej hawa main sihar rahe the
 All the fear of my mind, all the terror was gone, and i had remembered that i am the editor-in-chief of my newspaper magazine section, and Irene has requested to work under me
 "dekhie, dayanand sahab aapane itane saaf lafjon main nahin poocha hota, to main yahi kahati ki main rupayon ke liye nahin, shauk ke liye, jarnalism ke apane shauk ke liye aapke newspaper main kaam karnaa chaahati hoon
 But, i will not say so now
 aap bahut eemaandaar aadmi hai, aapse koi baat chhipaane se meraa laabh nahin he, nuksaan he
 Let me show you my house
 " irine ne kaha, or uth khadi hui
 Grabbing my hand, almost pulling me in, led me into the opening door
 pardaa hataakar ham donon bheetar gaye
 There was nothing inside, a very small kitchen room
 kamare main ek ore chuulhe par chaaval pak rahaa tha, khaane ke bartan bikhare the, do-teen bade-bade trunk rakkhe the, bistaron ke bandal pade the, ghar-gruhasthi kaa puraa saamaan padaa tha
 And on the other side, three sisters were sitting on the ground laying the carpet
 shakuntla film fere kaa koi purana ank palat rahi thi
 Lilu was choosing pebbles and stones from rice
 shilu adleti padi thi or tad ke pattey kaa pankhaa khud ko or apni badi bahinon ko jhal rahi thi
 The brother was sitting on a fold and was reading a book of physics
 or kamare main kahin jagah nahin batch rahi thi jahaan main or irine ek saath khadey ho sakate
 The sisters and brother did not see me because i was hiding behind half the curtain and half behind Irene
 shakuntla ne bahut utsuk or chintit swar main poocha- "didi, tumhen naukari mil jaaegi na? ve kya kah rahe the?"main waapas aakar sofe par baith gaya
 Irene came back, standing near the door and said- "dayanand sir, everything in this room has been rented and the rent has not been paid for the last five-seven months
 or, nepali beyara or naukaraani mere nahin hai bagal ke bade flats waalon ke hai
 Those people are kind, sometimes letting their servants take us to work
 "maine irine ko koi uttar nahin diya, buji hui nigahon se dringroom kii har chiz dekhtaa rahaa
 Kept looking at Irene
 irine ko fishan se or mechap se or aisho-ishrat se vaaki nafrat he

 inputah bhashaa Today, we are living in a world in which serious, metabolic and metabolic diseases are increasing rapidly
 swasthya kii aisi samasyaon se jujhate yuva varg kii sankhya main teji se vruddhi isliye or bhi chintaa paidaa karti he kyonki unki yah umr jindagi kaa bharpoor majaa lene kii hoti he
 Appearance of patients suffering from heart attack or cancer in the third decade of age is now common
 kam umr main haai bladpressure, diabetes or duusare gambhir rog hone se jindagi kii chunautiyon kaa saamana karne kii kshamta kam hoti he or man avsaad se bhar jaataa he
 There are several reasons for the rise in severe and metabolic diseases
 in vikrutiyon main diabetes, ucch raktchaap, hriday dhamniyon ke rog, aanton kii bimaariyaan, osteoporosis or thyroid kii vikrutiyaan shaamil hai
 One out of every three people in India is suffering from diabetes or high blood pressure and around 12% of the population is suffering from diabetes ie India is the highest in the world
 isi tarah har aayu varg main or stri or purushon main samaan rup se cancer kaa failaav hua he
 Almost one in three women above the age of forty may suffer from breast cancer, uterine cancer, or osteoporosis
 isi tarah purushon main prostate cancer, fefde kaa cancer, amashay kaa cancer, or hriday rog jaisi samasyaayein bad rahi hai
 Genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors are responsible for increasing the number of victims of many of these diseases
 genetic kaarnon par to hamaara koi niyantran nahin he lekin apni jivan style or maahaul main badlaav laakar ham inamen se anek vikrutiyon se bachane yaa unhen taalane kii koshish to kar hi sakate hai
 As a precaution for your protection, a health check is necessary to know what the situation is and where there is a possibility of danger
 hamen yaad rakhana chahie ki zyaadaatar maamalon main jaldi nidaan ho jaae to samaadhaan ho saktaa he
 People generally question that at what age should health checkup begin? As a precautionary health check should not be done because we are unwell, but the aim is to be healthy
 isliye yah kaam jaldi se jaldi yani koi rog hone se pehle shuru kar dena chahie
 Health checkup may not be the same for everyone
 har stri yaa purush ko apni aayu, swasthya or rogon kii sthiti, jokhim vaale karkon kii upasthiti ke anuroop jaanch karwaani chahie
 a basic test to identify symptoms of diabetes, high blood pressure or heart disease can also work for a healthy thirty-year-old man, but at the age of forty, a healthy woman has diseases like breast and uterine cancer and a healthy man with prostate cancer
 And it may also be necessary to check the symptoms of conditions like heart artery disease
 iske alaava rahan-sahan, parivaar ke duusare logon main rogon kii sthiti or vyakti ke apane swasthya ko dekhte hue jokhim ke duusare lakshanon kii jaanch kii aavashyaktaa bhi ho sakati he
 Osteoporosis, breast cancer, uterine or cervical cancer and metabolic pathologies must be investigated for women above 40 years of age in India
 kuch saamaanya test to hote hi hai, unke alaava kuch vishesh or vyakti athwa rog vishesh se sambhddha jaanch karana bhi jaruri ho saktaa he
 In this era of constantly modern technology, there are also many laboratory signs i
e
 clinical lab biomarkers that show the symptoms of every disease
 isi tarah se 40 saal se zyada ke purushon ke liye hriday or nason ke rog, prostate or fefde kaa cancer, diabetes hone par gurde kii sthiti, metabolic vikrutiyon or antrashoth sambandhi vikrutiyon kii jaanch aavashyak he
 Comprehensive cardiovascular investigations include treadmill tests, echocardiography and definitive indicators such as homocysteine and lipoprotein-a
 isamen koi andeh nahin ki vyakti vishesh ke liye jokhim paidaa karne vaale karkon, medical history par charchaa karne or aavashyak swasthya sambandhi jaanch ke bare main faisla lene ke liye doctor se paraamarsh bhi aavashyak he
 Often people are reluctant to get a health checkup so that there is no disturbance
 par yaad rakhen agar vaaki chintaa kaa koi kaaran he to jitani jaldi aap ko maaloom hoga, utani jaldi aap ilaaj karvaa sakenge or swasth rahane ke liye apane rahan-sahan or maahaul main badlaav laa sakenge

 In fact, just before Diwali, the Supreme Court has banned the sale of firecrackers in Delhi, after which the problem arose in front of the traders, what to do with the stock of crackers worth millions of rupees
 aise main kuch vyapaariyon ne online companiyon se baat kii or unhen apana stock de diya
 Since then the company was selling online firecrackers in delhi-ncr
 pataakhon ke shaukeenlog bhi in websiton se pataakhe kharid rahe the lekin ab online bhi pataakhe milanaa band ho gaye hai

 Online companies are giving crackers, but not in delhi-ncr

 Initially, some online companies were giving a bank account to people wanting to buy crackers, on which people buying crackers could transfer money
 iske alaava kuch websiten cash on delivery kaa vikalp bhi de rahi thim, lekin iske liye kam se kam 5000 rupye kii khariddaari jaruri thi
 However, after the sale of firecrackers from earlier shops and now from online shopping sites, Delhiites have no choice but to celebrate Diwali without firecrackers

 Every parent wants to get their child enrolled in a good school in the capital, but the confusion of the point system's mind-boggling and changing guidelines has left parents stressed
 nursery admician: dilli main 298 privet skulon main khatm hua management kotashiksha nideshaalay ke nae circular se didie kii jameen par bane privet skool to naakhush hai hi saath hi nebarhud kaa nayaa formula abhibhavakon ko bhi raas nahin aa rahaa he
 In such a situation, the concern of parents who do not have good schools within one kilometer radius has increased
 halaat ye he ki ab abhibhavakon ko oxford uniwarsity main daakhile kii prakriya dilli ke skulon se aasaan lag rahi he
 Nursery Admission: To be released soon Guidelines for 298 schools Prashant Gupta, who lives in Trilokpuri, wants to enroll his little ones in the nursery but it is not so easy to enroll their children in the capital schools
 prashanth gupta ke mutabik trilokapuri ke aas-paas koi bhi acha skool nahin he, mayur vihaar phej van ke jin skulon main wo apane bachche daakhila karana chaahate hai, wo unke ghar se kareeb 2 kilometre kii duuri par he
 But with the aim of providing relief to the parents, the Neighborhood formula of 0-1 km has been made compulsory for schools built on dda's land by the Delhi government
 Have become
 haalanki aise bhi abhibhavak hai jo skool ke ird-gird rahete hai or najadik ke bacchon ko daakhila dene ke anivaaryta ke faisle se khush hai, lekin aise abhibhavak jo skool se thodi duuri par rahete hai unki chintaa bad gai he
 According to Nidhi Khanna, who lives in Preet Vihar, admission at Oxford University is easier than enrolling in nursery schools in Delhi
 samasya ye he ki sarkaar har saal daakhile ke niyam badalati he
 There were more rules last year, some more this year
 sarkaar ko agar niyam badalane hi he to phir skulon se baatcheet tak 3-4 maheene pehle se hi isaki taiyaari kyon nahin kar leti
 There should be a clear guideline at least during admission, which is easy for parents to understand
 ham do janvari se agal alag skulon main form bhar rahe hai, sabake alag alag point system he, ab didie kii jameen vaale skulon ke alag niyam aa gaye hai
 Can't understand what's going on JNU: jiescash kamity ke liye nahin hua chunaavdarasal ye pehali baar he ki rajdhani ke privet skulon main nursery daakhile ke liye ek nahin, do nahin balki teen tarah ke niyam lagu he
 The first guideline for schools on private land in which the admission process has started from January 2
 duusari, sarkari jameen par bane skulon ke liye najadik ke bacchon ko anivaary daakhila dene kaa niyam, jise lekar asamanjas kii sthiti bani hui he
 Third, a guideline for the 25 per cent EWS / DG category that has not yet been released
 lihaaja EWS ketegory vaale abhibhavak bhi guideline ke abhaav main skool-dar-skool bhatak rahe hai
 Most of these are such parents who are unaware that till now the government has not issued any guidelines for the EWS / DG category
 isliye wo rojaanaa skulon ke chakkar laga rahe hai, taaki daakhile kii res main unka baccha peeche naa rah jaae
 There is a lot of special problems in the Book Fair for the preparation of competitive exams
 The problem was not just with this new formula, but after the release of the new guidelines, there was no information from schools on Monday
 aise main skulon main daakhila kab se shuru hoga, prakriya online hogi yaa ofline jaise kai sawaalon ne abhibhavakon ko skool ke chakkar lagane par majaboor kar diya tha
 Distressed by the different rules made for admission, the parents are blaming the Delhi government for this screw of admission
 to vahiin didie kii jameen par bane skool bhi dilli sarkaar ke nae formule se naakhush hai
 Explain that private schools are preparing to take the legal path by denying it autonomy

 During the Bihar elections, the war of words was already going on, but now the fight has gone far ahead
 darasal, RJD supremeo lalu prasad par shuukravaar ko raily ke dauraan pankhaa gira, to ab unhone ise ek alag rang dene kii koshish kii he
 Lalu Prasad alleged that 'tantra-mantra' is behind the falling of the fan and the game is being played by BJP and RSS
 unhone siyasat ke sadhe khilaadi kii tarah ise bijepi or aresas kii sajeesh qaraar diya
 It is said that everything is justified in politics and war
 motihaari kii raily ke jisahadase main lalu bal-bal batch gaye, use argedy pramukh ne minuton main vot jutaney kaa hathiyaar bana diya
 He started talking about the 'lucky Lockett' worn around his neck to save his life
 bijepi ne turant kiya palatwabhi lalu ne aarope lagaaya hi tha ki bijepi kii ore se turant palatwaar bhi aa gaya
 Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad termed Lalu's allegation as 'the pinnacle of desperation'
 unhone kaha ki lalu apane kaaryakartaaon kii galati bijepi par madh rahe hai
 BJP leader Sushil Modi tweeted about the incidents happening on stage with Sushil Modi, Tanjalalu
 susheel modi ne kaha ki lalu ko unke paapon par jaldi hi sajaa milane vaali he
 Sometimes Lalu Prasad's stage breaks, sometimes a fan falls on him
 phir bhi ve nahin samaj paa rahe hai ki unhen 15 saal ke jangalraj, gomance khaane 1 / 1

 jab chunavi ladaai ko 'mandal' or 'kamandal' kaa doosraa adhyay bataaya ja rahaa ho, to navaratri main maa durga ke 'lucky locket' kaa daanv khilne se kaisaa gurej? Congress leader is not taking the name of Shashi Tharoor to stop
 dilli kii ek adaalat ne unke khilaaf manahani maamle main faisla surakshit rakh liya he
 a defamation case was filed by BJP leader Rajib Babbar against him for allegedly comparing Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a scorpion
 is maamle par dilli kii rouse avenue court 27 agast ko faisla sunayega
 Shashi Tharoor faced criticism for the statement 'scorpion sitting on Shivling'
 is maamle main kai sunwaayee ho chuki hai or siarpisi ke section 251 ke tahat maamla darj karaayaa gaya tha
 At the Bangalore Literature Festival last year, Tharoor said that an unknown RSS source had told a journalist
 jiskaa main hawala detaa hum
 In which the RSS leader expressed disappointment over not being able to control Modi
 tharur ne sutara ke hawaale se kaha, 'modi shivlinga par baithe us bichchhu kii tarah hai, jise na to aap chappal maar sakate hai or na hi haath se hataa sakate hai
 After this, Delhi BJP Vice President Rajiv Babbar filed a lawsuit against Shashi Tharoor for hurting religious sentiments
 haalanki tharur ne in aaropon ko bebuniyaad or bhraamak bataaya or 5 karod muaavja maanga
 In his complaint, Rajiv Babbar said, 'I am a devotee of Lord Shiva
 aaropee (tharur) ne karodon shivbhakton kii aasthaa ko thes pahunchaaya
 Tharoor, while defying this defamation case, said that this is an attempt to crush his freedom of expression
 hindu dharm main rishi panchami (rishi Panchami) kaa kaaphi mahatv he
 Sapta Rishi is worshiped on this Panchami
 bataa den, is panchami kaa naata mahilaon ke periods sehai
 Actually, there is a belief in Hinduism that no woman should do religious work during menstruation
 yadikisi mahila se periods ke dauraan dharmik kaary ho jaae to vah rishi panchami kaa vrath kar apni bhul sudhaar sakati he
 According to the Puranas, Brahma, the creator of the universe, has described the fast of Rishi Panchami as the one to remove sins
 manyata he ki is vrath ko karne se mahilaayein dosha mukt hoti hai
 This is the ninth month of the Hindu calendar
 ise agrahan yaa aghan kaa maheenaa bhi kehete hai
 It is considered the most sacred month in Hindu scriptures
 yah itnaa pavitra he ki bhagwaan gita main kehete hai ki - maheenon main, manmargshirshahun
 The beginning of the Satyuga is considered from this month
 kashyap rishi ne isi maheene main kashmir kii rachana kii thi
 This month is considered best for chanting and meditation
 is maheene main pavitra nadiyon main snaan karnaa vishesh faldaayi hota he
 This time the month of Margashirsha will be from 24 November to 22 December
 margshirsh maheene main kis-kis tarah ke laabh hote hai?- is maheene main mangalakaarya vishesh faldaayi hote hai
 In this month, worship of Shri Krishna and bathing in holy rivers is auspicious
 - is maheene main santan ke liye vardaan bahut saralata se miltaa he
 - At the same time there is also the attainment of the nectar element from the moon
 - is maheene main kirthan karne kaa fal amogh hota he
 What should be kept in mind during the month of Margashirsha? - Massage of oil is very good in this month
 - is maheene se snigdh chizon kaa seven armbh kar dena chahie
 Cumin should not be consumed in this month
 - is maheene se mote vastron kaa upyog armbh kar dena chahie
 - One must worship evening from this month
 margshirsh ke maheene se kaise chamakaaen kismat?- is maheene main nity gita kaa paath karen
 As far as possible worship Lord Krishna
 - tulsi ke patton kabhogalagaayein or useprasadki tarah grahan karen
 - Chant "om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya" for the whole month
 - agar is maheene kisi pavitrandimen snaan kaa avasar mili to avashya karen
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Prahlad Joshi said that "on Monday, Azam Khan will be asked to apologize unconditionally in the House
" agar ve maafee nahin maangate hai to unke khilaaf karrwai karne ke liye spikar ko adhikrut kiya gaya he
 Earlier on Friday, all parties including BJP, Congress, Trinamool Congress, NCP in the Lok Sabha strongly condemned Azam Khan's remarks about Presiding Chairman Rama Devi off the party line and demanded the speaker to take stern action in the matter
 
 is maamle par shoonyakaal main nichle sadan main vibhinn dalon kii mahila saansadon samet dalon ke netaaon ne apni baat rakhi
 The women mps demanded the speaker to take action that could become 'nazir'
 vidhi mantri ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki yaa to ajam khan iske liye maafee maangen yaa unhen nilambit kar diya jaae
 Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla decided after hearing the issue of leaders and members of various parties that they would take a meeting with the leaders of all parties and decide about it
 dilli main 17 or 18 march ko yojit congress ke purna adhiveshan main party adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha tha, ''is manch ko dekho
 i have cleared this forum for you
 is manch par main pratibhavan yuvaaon ko khinchakar laaungaa
 "about 15,000 Congress workers present at the session expressed their happiness with applause
 yuvaaon par kitna jor diya gaya tha, yah manch ko dekhne se hi pataa chal rahaa tha or puraani parampara kii ravaanagi kii pratikatmak gavaahi de rahaa tha—congress ke bade netaa manch ke saamne kursiyon par baithe hue the, na ki manch par bichhi kaaleen par
 Four months later, when Rahul formed the Congress Working Committee (CWC) — the party's largest decision-making body — the Congress president proved utterly unsuccessful in keeping his promise
 46-sadasyeey seedblusi ke sadasyon—paden sadasyon ko chhodkar—kii ausat umr 63 saal he or unamem se 12 sadsy 70 varsh se zyada kii umr ke hai
 But what was even more disappointing was that Rahul backed away from his repeated promises to bring internal democracy to the young leaders in the party to come forward
 digvijay singh or janardan dvivedi jaise apwaadon ko chhod den to congress adhyaksh ne apni maa sonia gandhi ke netritv main kaam karne vaale adhikansh netaaon ko banaae rakhaa he
 Nine of the so-called 'young Turks' are either inherited leaders or belong to a royal family
 seedblusi main jagah banane vaale ek maatr yuva netaa, jisaki koi rajnatik viraasat nahin rahi he, 43 varshiya rajeev saatav hai
 The appearance and structure of the CWC once again proves that senior Congress leaders still continue to dominate the party
 8 march ko mumbai main india today ke conklev main party kii purv adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne bhi sweekaar kiya tha ki rahul gandhi hameshaa se hi yuva netaaon ko tarjeeh dena chaahate the lekin varisht netaaon ne unhen aisa nahin karne diya
 On 16 July, Rahul wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting the passage of the Women's Reservation Bill in the monsoon session of Parliament
 is vidheyak main loksabhaa or sabhi vidhansabhaon main mahilaon ke liye 33 pratishat siton ke aarakshan kii baat kahi gai he

 Bollywood actress Rakhi Sawant also agreed with Uddhav Thackeray's statement that she (rakhi Sawant) could be a better administrator than Arvind Kejriwal

 uddhav ne jo bhi likhaa he, sahi he
 i am Marathi and Uddhav cannot speak anything against any Marathi
 wo acha kaam kar rahe hai, logon kii seva kar rahe hai

 The District Education Superintendent has directed action against 11 teachers in the case of demonstrations by contract-working teachers in Darbhanga district during Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's Adhikar Yatra Sammelan

 mushkilen to har kisi ke jivan main aati rahati he
 When we end a problem, we think that now life will be cut off by then any other problem starts knocking at our door
 jab kabhi ham kisi safal vyakti ko dekhte hai to sochate hai kaash, aisi safalataa hamen naseeb hui hoti yaa yah sochate hai ki kitni aasaani se inhen sab kuch mil gaya lekin aisa nahin he
 These people also faced the same difficulties and difficulties which one has to face to get success, but the way of dealing with these problems was different
 jaaniye aisi paanch pareshaaniyon jiske bare main safal logon ne nahin sochaa:1
 What people will think: Most of the people in this world work not by their own will but by looking at or influencing others
 yahi nahin, jab kuch nayaa karne kaa prayaas karte hai to ye sochane lagate hai ki is bare main log kya sochenge
 Before thinking about people, know that those people never talk about your reality
 ve yaa to aapako bahut acha kahenge yaa bahut kharaab
 Therefore it is useless to care about them
 2
 Fear: If we talk about fear then it is nothing more than our imagination
 safal vyakti ko pataa hota he ki agar ve risk nahin lenge or darate rahenge to safalataa kabhi nahin milegi
 3
 beetaa hua kal yaa bhavishya:hamamen se zyaadaatar logon kaa jivan to yahi sochate hue biit jaataa he ki bhavishya kaisaa hoga
 Thinking about the future, always cursing our past
 iske kaaran hameshaa vartmaan kharaab ho jaataa he
 The successful person always moves forward using every minute of his present
 4
 Negativity: This is the one thing that can ruin our every dream
 ham jab bhi kuch karnaa chaahate hai sabase pehle yahi sochate hai 'nahin ham nahin kar paaenge, hamaare andar ise karne kii kshamta nahin he
 'it also spoils the work of having negative thoughts, so negativity should be avoided as far as possible
 5
 Age: You don't think age is just a number name
 safal vyakti kabhi bhi apane umr se nahin jataata he ki vah kya he or koun he? choti se choti umr main logon ne badikamyaabiyanhasil kii hai
 At the same time, despite their age, people have proved themselves with their hard work

 sibiai ne ghotaale ke mukhya aaropee neerav modi ko pakadaney ke liye interpol kii madad maangi he
 For this, notice has been given to airports around the world, so that Indian agencies can know if Nirav tries to go somewhere
 PNB mahaghotaalaa: 3 aropiyon ko remand, neerav faraar, kaise vasuul honge 11400 karod?isse pehle bhi interpol ke jariye ye notice jari kiya ja chukaa tha, lekin wo kuch hi deshon ke liye tha
 Now this notice is for the world

 After the resentment on the streets of the students, the Ministry of Human Resource Development has set up a three-member high power committee to resolve the matter, but before the report of the High Power Committee, the JNU administration created a high-level committee and gave recommendations on the hostel manual
 isamen nae hostel manual main utility or sarvice charge ko 2000 ru se ghataakar 1000 ru karne kaa praavdhaan he

 JNU Students Union President Aishi Ghosh has made it clear that this strike will continue

 khabar he ki ab rajnath singh bijepi ke nae adhyaksh banenge
 According to reports, the name of Rajnath Singh has been stamped in the BJP
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki gadakari par lag rahe aaropon kii vajah se sangh ne apana haath peeche khinch liya jisase unka adhyaksh bananaa mushkil ho gaya he
 BJP President Nitin Gadkari then resigned
 hamaare sahyogi channel ajtak ke saath baatcheet main gadakari ne kaha ki ve dobaaraa bijepi ke adhyaksh nahin banenge
 Gadkari says that he is resigning after being fed up with the allegations
 haalanki unka ye bhi kahana he ki jaanch main ve bedaag sabit honge or vaapasi karenge
 According to reports, there will be a meeting of the BJP Parliamentary Party on Wednesday morning, in which the name of Rajnath Singh will be formalized
 buudhvaar subah saadhe nau (9
 30) There will be a meeting of BJP Parliamentary Board, in which Rajnath's name will be formally stamped
 parliamentry board kii meeting ke baad hi rajnath adhyaksh pad ke chunaav kaa parchaa bharenge
 Significantly, the bjp's big leaders were trying to build consensus throughout the day
 mumbai main laalkrishna adwani, nitin gadakari or sangh ke netaa bhaiyya ji joshi ek manch par dikhe
 There was some talk among them as well, but Advani's mood was uprooted
 raat 8 baje dilli main bijepi netaaon kii baithak hui, jisamen rajnath ke naam par sahmati bani
 Rajnath Singh has also been the President of BJP for four years earlier
 disambar 2005 main unhone laalkrishna adwani ke istife ke baad party kii kaman sanbhali thi
 The BJP contested the 2009 general elections under the leadership of Rajnath
 lekin aam chunaav main UPA ke haathon NDA kii haar ke baad rajnath kii jagah nitin gadakari ko bijepi adhyaksh bana diya gaya tha
 Rajnath, who was the Chief Minister of UP, is currently a Ghaziabad MP
 udhar bijepi netaa or purv videsh mantri yashavanth sinha ne kaha he ki wo adhyaksh pad kaa chunaav nahin ladenge
 Yashwant Sinha had called for the nomination form for the election for the post of president on Tuesday
 nomination form lene ke liye unhone party kaa phulatime kaaryakarta hone kaa saboot bhi pesh kiya tha
 Yashwant Sinha's move made it clear that there is no consensus in the BJP in the name of Gadkari
 gauratlab he ki gadakari ke iraadon par pehla vajrapaat ram jethmalani ke bete ne kiya tha
 Mahesh Jethmalani had earlier accused Gadkari of corruption
 unhone sidhe party ke aantarik loktantr par sawaal uthaaya or kaha unhen bhi adhyaksh kaa chunaav ladane ke liye namakan patr chahie lekin mil nahin rahe he
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, it seems difficult for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to repeat the results like 2014
 khaskar uttar bharat ke un rajyon main jahaan bijepi ne pichley loksabhaa chunaav main vipakshi dalon kaa safaya kar diya tha
 In the current era, the bjp's equation seems to be messing around in these states, in such a situation, the party has joined the 'mission South Alliance' to compensate for this loss
 bataa den ki dakshin bharat ke andhra pradesh, telugana, karnataka, tamilnadu or kerala aise paanch rajya hai jinamein kareeb 130 loksabhaa siten hai
 In the 2014 parliamentary elections, BJP could win only 20 seats from these states
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi ne dakshin ke in rajyon kii loksabhaa siton par khaas focus kiya he
 For this, she wants to strengthen her roots by tying up with the satraps
 bijepi dakshin bharatki raajnneetik dalon ke saath gathbandhan kii kavayad shuru kii he
 a senior BJP leader told that party president Amit Shah is trying for an alliance in Tamil Nadu
 haalanki party kii koshish he ki gathbandhan vyavaaharik taur hona chahie
 In Andhra Pradesh, the TDP is seen forming along with the Congress
 aise main bijepi chunaav se pehle chote dalon ke saath haath milaane kii koshishon main juty hai
 The English newspaper Indian Express quoted the BJP leader as saying, 'weakness of the Congress is our only possibility in these five states
 ham sahyogiyon ko saath lekar chalane main congress se aage hai
 The BJP is in a very good position and sits on the table with allies and gives special consideration to their talk
 'bijepi telugana main tiares ko apane sahyogi ke taur par maanakar chal rahi he
 Actually, Congress and TRS are face to face in Telangana
 aise main bijepi ko tiares se ummid najar aa rahi he
 While the floods in Kerala have reduced the bjp's prospects
 darasal dakshini bharat main bijepi ke ek maatr sahyogi rahitidipi ab saath chhodchuki he
 Apart from this, there is not much better relationship with Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and Akali Dal in Punjab
 jabaki bihar main araspi ne to mahagathbandhan ke saath jane ke sanket die hai
 The BJP has governments in many states in North India, where it is facing an anti-incumbency wave
 iske alaava kai rajyon main vipakshi dalon ke ekajute hone se bijepi kaa sameekaran bigadataa najar aa rahaa he
 In such a situation, BJP is seeing some expectations from the states of South India
 bijepi isi ranneeti ke tahat tamilnadu main ek sahyogi dal kii talash main he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to see DMK chief Karunanidhi during his illness and attended Chennai's funeral on his death
 diemke ne karunanidhi ke liye smarak baithak main bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko aamantrit karke sabhi ko aashcharyachakit kar diya
 Apart from this, DMK working president MK Stalin, MP Kanimozhi reached Delhi in a tribute meeting of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 jiske baad raajnneetik kayaas lagaae jane lage hai
 The senior leader said that such a sign should not be seen as a preparation to form an alliance with the BJP
 haalanki unhone kaha ki tamilnadu main ediemke vaicharik rup se bijepi virdohi nahin he
 While DMK is with the anti-bjp camp
 tamilnadu kii 39 siton main se bijepi 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mahaj ek seat hi jiti he
 The state has a socio-political structure
 bijepi netaaon ne kaha ki maujuuda samay main tamilnadu ek aisi sthiti kaa saamana kar rahaa he jisamen ek pramukh kshetreey party kamjor ho gai he or duusare ke netritv ko abhi tak samarthan nahin mila he
 The BJP leader said that in such a name we will get the benefit of Modi and people will join us
 iske alaava unhone kaha ki kerala main bijepi ne apana vot share badhaane main kaamyaab rahi he
 However, no electoral victory has been won yet
 odisha main party kii majboot hoti sthiti ke baad bijepi ke satta main lautne ke uddeshy se dakshini rajyon kii seat adhik mahatvapurn ho gai he
 After their initial attack against the BJD, the matter between the two parties is quiet during the monsoon session
 bijedy ke rajyasabha up-sabhapati pad ke chunaav main endie ke saath matdaan karne ke kadam ne drushtikon main badlaav ke sanket die hai
 Many in the BJP think that the old practice of regional parties focusing on assembly elections and leaving national parties to contest parliamentary elections may return
 jabaki tisare morche ke liye bahut zyada sambhaavnaaen nahin rah gai hai
 In such a situation, TRS and Naveen Patnaik may come with the NDA
 babari masjid-ramamandir vivaad maamle kii sunwaayee supreme court main chal rahi he, lekiyodhyakesadhu-santmandir nirmaan ko lekar ab intjaar ke mood main nahin hai
 To pressurize Modi and the Yogi government of UP, saints and saints are starting fast on Monday
 ramamandir nirmaan ke liye tapasvi chhavnee mandir ke mahant ram paramhans das aamaran anshan karenge
 In Ramnagari, he will sit on a hunger strike under the Ashoka tree
 paramhans das ne bataaya ki ye anshan tab tak jari rahegaa jab tak ramamandir nirmaan kaa maarg prashast nahin ho jaataa
 Paramahansa Das said that all Muslims want the Ram temple to be built in Ayodhya
 hamaari ladaai muslimon se nahin he
 He said that all we need is Ram temple, Ram Janmabhoomi cannot be anywhere else in the world
 isliye muslim bhai ramamandir nirmaan main sahyog karen
 Its message will go worldwide
 sadhu santo ne kaha ki hinduvaadi sanghathanon ne milakar bijepi ko satta saunpi he
 Despite this, the BJP has not yet taken any step towards temple construction
 unhone kaha ki modi sarkaar jab anya kanoon laa sakati he to ramamandir ke liye kanoon kyon nahin laati
 Paramahansa Das said that Modi's term is nearing completion, but our aspirations are still unfulfilled, so now we will do the manhood for the Ram temple itself, why not die for it
 unhone kaha ki anshan kii soochna raashtrapati, pradhanmantri, mukhyamantri se lekar jila prashasan bhej di gai he
 Paramahansa Das said that the program of shilapujan in the temple is also being started from Monday
 yah shilapujan bhi mandir nirmaan hone tak anwarat jari rahegaa
 He said that in addition to saints and saints daily, Rambhaktas will also be present in Shilapujan
 cashles tranjaction jaise jaise bad rahaa he vaise vaise sibar frod bhi bad rahe hai
 This has happened not only in India but wherever the cashless economy started
 lekin un deshon ke mukaable bharat main sibar security ke maamle main lachar maamla he
 Especially for those who have started using smartphones, computers and internet
 iske jariye jaahir he wo banking bhi kar rahe hai
 Banking means entering sensitive information
 lekin kai baar havers nae yugers ko torget badi aasaani se kar lete hai, iske liye unhen zyada mushkil bhi nahin hoti
 For example, there have been many cases where new users are fooled by cloning a backing app or website
 isaki rokthaam ke liye rigerv bank of india ne bainkon ko kuch nirdesh die hai jo yugers ke suraksha kaa intjaam karengi
 Although we tell you some ways to stay safe
 agar aapane haal hi main mobile yaa internet banking kii shuruyaat kii he to aap in baton kaa dhyaan rakhen
 - Do not click any pop-up in the smartphone in which information about banking is being sought
 - online tranjaction karte samay website ke pehle dekhen ki HTTPS laga he yaa nahin
 If not, then stop
 - kisi bhi haalat main apana yujaranem or password kahin likhakar na rakhen or nahi kisi kesath share karen
 - Many times you get mails about the offer in the email which states that you can avail the offer by entering your account information
 aise bilkul na karen
 - Register your mobile number from your account and read the message carefully after every transaction
 - apane computer main premium anti virus install karke rakhen or samay samay par scan karte rahen
 The Reserve Bank of India has asked banks to strengthen the security system
 sabhi bank or digital pement sansthaaen in adeshon kaa sahi dhang se paalan kar rahe hai yaa nahin yah sunishchit karne ke liye rigerv bank ne unhen 21 disambar tak department of pement and setelment ko apana vistrut plan saunpane ke liye kaha he
 In this, they will also have to give the name and time of the auditor to get their network audited
 rigerv bank ke mutabik 500 rupee or 1000 rupee kii karency ko band karne ke baad se desh main online pement or cashles tranjaction kaa chalan teji se bad rahaa he
 In such a situation, if cyber attack or fraud on banks or other digital payment platform can stop our move towards cashless economy
 kya hoga is audit membank or digital pement placeform kaa audit karne vaali companiyaan unke hardware dhaanche, oparating system or critical programs kaa baariki se adhyayan karengi
 Audit companies will also ensure that the bank's online payment gateway, the communication platform of ATM machines, the security of point of sale machines are maintained and updated
 iske saath hi is audit main yah bhi tay hoga ki kya bainkon ne suraksha ke liye sabhi jaruri kadam uthaae hai yaa nahin
 It also includes their recovery in the event of an accident or cyber attack and training the staff to deal with any situation
 kya he cert-in ?cert-in ek rashtriya nodel agency he jo computer suraksha sambandhit kisi ghatana se nipatane ke liye sabhi ehtiyathan kadam uthaati he
 IT Act (amendment) 2008 - This agency is capable of taking the following necessary steps for cyber security- bijepi ne apane teen varisht netaaon laal krishna adwani, murali manohar joshi or atal bihari vaajapeyi ko party ke sansadeey board main shaamil nahin kiya he
 He has been given a place in the guide board
 bijepi ke is faisle par chutki lete hue congress ne kaha ki in netaaon ko vriddhashram (old age home) main daal diya gaya he or unka maardarshak mandal sirf mookadarshak mandal rahegaa
 The Congress said that this development is a sign of the process of handing over complete power in the hands of one person
 party kaa ishaara pradhanmantri narendra modi kii taraf tha
 Congress leader Rashid Alvi said, 'this is a silent audience
 yah vriddhashram jaisaa he jahaan adwani or joshi mook abhinayta kii tarah bijepi ke kaamkaaj ko dekhenge
 We all know that they are being planted
 'purv soochna evam prasaaran mantri manish tiwari ne kaha ki yah ghatnakram ek haath main satta ke kendrikaran kii prakriya kii nishaani he
 NCP leader DP Tripathi termed it as an internal matter of the BJP and said that the new faces that have emerged in place of BJP veterans are also important for the party
 bijepi ke varisht netaa seepi thakur ne kaha ki yah badlaav kii prakriya ho sakati he
 He said it was the party's decision on which he would not comment
 bijepi main nirnay karne vaale sheersh nikaay sansadeey board main party ke sansthaapak rahe atal bihari vaajapeyi, laalkrishna adwani or murali manohar joshi ko sthaan nahin diya gaya
 Vajpayee, Advani and Joshi have been ranked in the five-member newly formed Guide Board

 film ke trailor ko mix rivyuu mili hai
 However, Hrithik's acting is being liked

 somvaar ko ayodhya main ram janmabhumi-babari masjid par supreme court main hui sunwaayee maatr 3 minute main hi tal gai
 The bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi has now fixed January 2019 for the case
 yani ab ye maamla kareeb 3 maheene baad hi court main uthegaa
 This issue of land connected with Ram Janmabhoomi has been very complicated
 2010 main elahabaad hai court ne vivaadit bhoomi ko teen hisson main baantne kaa aadesh diya tha, lekin us faisle ko supreme court main chunauti di gai, jiske tahat ayodhya vivaad ketital suut(jameen ke malikana haq se judaa cese) par sunwaayee hogi
 The Supreme Court hearing on this decades-old issue, which shakes the foundations of social fabric, is directly related to the ground
 kya he ayodhya kaa tital suut?-1950 main gopal singh vishaarad ne elahabaad hai court main ayodhya masale par yachika daayar kii
 This petition sought to allow worship at the disputed site in Hindu customs
 -1959 main nirmohi akhaada ne vivaadit bhoomi par niyantran kii maang kii
 On the lines of the Nirmohi Akhara, the Muslim Central Waqf Board also staked its claim on the disputed land in the court
 -2010 main elahabaad hai court ne vivaadit jameen ko teen hisson main baant diya
 The court ordered Ramlala Virajaman, Nirmohi Akhara and Sunni Waqf Board to hand over portions of the land
 -elahabaad hai court ke is faisle par koi bhi paksh raji nahin hua or supreme court main ise chunauti di gai
 On 9 May 2011, the Supreme Court stayed the Allahabad High Court verdict
 ab supreme court main isi masale par phir se sunwaayee hone ja rahi he
 The court has already made it clear in this case that this hearing will be done only on the land dispute, it has nothing to do with any other issue
 dilli main loksabhaa kii sabhi saat siton par karaari haar ke baad ab arvind kejariwal sarkaar ne puraa dhyaan vidhansabha chunaav par focus kar liya he
 The party is trying to expand its base so that the Lok Sabha elections do not happen in next year's assembly elections
 isi kadi main ek nayaa 'mahila vot bank' taiyaar karne kaa makasad he
 In Delhi Metro and DTC buses, the gift of free travel to women is being linked to this
 chunaav ayog ke aankade bataate hai ki kul 1
 There are over 64 lakh women out of 43 crore voters
 jaahir si baat he ki mahilaon kii aabaadi acchhee-khaasi he
 In this case, success can be achieved in the assembly elections by making women happy
 mana ja rahaa he ki isi 64 lakh mahila voters ko target kar hi arvind kejariwal kii aam aadmi party sarkaar ne mahilaon ko muft safar kii saugat dene kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Announcing the scheme on Monday afternoon, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that the facility will be started within two to three months
 vibhaagon se prajentation maanga gaya he
 However, he said that the subsidy will not be imposed
 jo mahilaayein sakasham hai, ve tikat lekar yatra kar saktin hai
 This scheme involving millions of women is being described as the masterstroke of the Aam Aadmi Party government
 dilli metro kii baat karen to vibhinn root par har din ausatan 26 lakh se adhik yatri safar karte hai
 There are about 30 to 33 percent women in it
 is prakaar dekhen to kejariwal sarkaar ke free ride faisle se dilli main har din aath lakh se adhik mahilaayein muft safar kii suvidha kaa laabh uthaa sakengi
 It is also not that only common people travel by metro in Delhi
 suvidhasampann parivaar bhi metro se safar pasand karte hai
 The reason is that the metro is the only resort in Delhi that suffers from the jam, which reaches the destination in time
 metro se safar main dhan kii bhi bachat hoti he
 Also beneficial for Delhi's climate in the winter season when Delhi is vulnerable to pollution
 chaaron ore fog hi fog najar aata he
 Then there is a demand to encourage people to use them by reducing the fare of public transport means like Metro, DTC buses etc
 muft safar kii suvidha lagu hone par un mahilaon main bhi metro se safar karne kii ruchi jaagegi, jo ab tak ghar yaa daftar tak aane-jane ke liye nijee vaahanon kaa istemaal karti hai
 Reduction in use of private vehicles will reduce pollution
 mahilaon ko free yatra dene main dmarsi ko hone vaale nuksaan kii bharpai dilli sarkaar karegi
 According to one figure, the implementation of this scheme in Delhi Metro and DTC buses will cost the government about Rs 1200 crore every year
 sasti bijli or muft pani kii saugat pehle sedilli main 70 main se 67 siten jitkar 2015 main sarkaar banane ke baad hi kejariwal sarkaar ne do badi ghoshnaaen kar janata ko lubhaane kii koshish kii thi
 The Aam Aadmi Party government had announced to reduce the rates of 20 thousand liters of free water and 400 units electricity bill every month to Delhiites
 us vakt kaha gaya tha ki bijli daron main katautee se 36 lakh or pani free kiye jane se 18 lakh pariwaron ko sidhaa phayda hoga
 Talking about the present time, new electricity rates are set from the year 2018
 pichley saal sarkaar ne prati unit ek se dedh rupee kii charge main katautee kii thi, haalaaki phixd charge kai guna bade the
 According to the March 2018 decision, at present, the rate of Rs 3 per unit instead of Rs 4 is applicable for electricity usage up to 200 units, while 5 from 201 to 400 units
 95 rupee kii bajaay 4
 The rate of Rs 50 per unit is applicable
 iske alaava 401 se lekar 800 unit tak ke bijli ke bill kaa bhugtan 7
 6 instead of 30 rupees
 50 rupee prati unit, 801 se lekar 1200 unit tak kaa bhugtan 8
 8 per unit of electricity instead of 10 and payment of electricity bill up to 1200 units 8
 75 rupee kii bajaay 7
 There is a provision of Rs 75 per unit
 sarkaar kaa daawa he ki usne bijli kii daren badhane se roak rakhin hai

 shuruyatbharat ke liye 1980 kaa dashak krantikari daur rahaa he
 Then we were rapidly adopting computer technology
 main isse sammohit tha or ICT ke kshetra ke deveopment par najar rakhe hue tha
 Soon i realized that everyone, from the government to corporates, is focusing their efforts on promoting metro and mini metro cities to promote ICT
 jila, block or panchayat str ke ilaake, jahaan desh kii 70 fisadi se zyada aabaadi rahati he, is krantikari concept se bekhbar the
 In view of this, i joined hands with like-minded people and founded AISECT, which was aimed at reducing ICT gap in semi-urban and rural India
 shahari-gramin vibhaajanalith ko hamane gramin bharat ke pahalu se dekha, use yah kyon chahie or IT literysi hasil kar vah kya karegaa
 So we built our model on demand

 We led IT training in Hindi and many other regional languages
 nishchit rup se aisa aasaan hota gaya kyonki assi ke dashak ke mukaable nabbe ke dashak ke log IT ke bare main zyada jaagruk ho gaye the
 In working at the ground level, we still have to face two challenges like electricity and connectivity
 panchayat str par yadi lagaataar bijli or broadband connactivity kii uplabdhta ho to vokational training main technology kii bhoomika ko or krantikari banaaya ja saktaa he
 My daily inspiration has been the biggest source of motivation for people around me

 These people believe in our ideology and want to help fulfill our goal of creating a strong rural India

 bijepi ne 'congress netritv kii samprag sarkaar ke das varshon kaa kaala yug' naamak aarope patr jari karte hue yah aarope lagaaya
 The chargesheet states that Sonia and Rahul are equal partners in destroying the dignity of the Prime Minister's Office

 On many occasions, huge mistakes and irregularities have occurred with the acceptance and approval of both of them
 bijepi netaa ravi shankar prasad kii ore se jari is aaropapatr main kaha gaya ki manmohan singh ne apni kursi bachaane ke liye har prakaar kaa samjhauta kiya
 On no occasion did the Prime Minister show activeness in stopping the constant scams and loot of public money
 inhen kaarnon se is sarkaar ko aazaadee ke baad sabase bhrasht sarkaar kaha gaya
 It has been alleged that the Prime Minister's own role in several cases of scams is under serious scope of doubt
 pradhanmantri par bijepi ne aarope lagaaya ki unhone sonia kii adhyakshata vaale board ke siio ke bataur kaary kiya, jahaan rahul unke dipti the
 The chargesheet said that the Prime Minister's post was devalued under the UPA rule, its dignity was compromised and the economy of the poor governance system suffered and the feeling of insecurity severely hit the national and international image of the country
 arthvyavastha kar di chaupatisamen ye aarope bhi lagaaya gaya ki upie ke 10 saal ke shashan main bhartiya arthvyavastha kaa vinaash kar diya gaya
 It said that when the UPA took power in 2004, it inherited 8 from the NDA

 The charge sheet said that at the same time the Congress Party is constantly trying to communalize the entire debate by portraying Muslims as victims of barbaric police action in the name of fighting against terrorism
 nirdosho kii giraftaar galatisamen kaha gaya ki nirdosh vyaktiyon kii galat tareeke se kii gai giraftaar ko katai uchit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa phir bhi aatankwaad ke khilaaf kii gai police karrwai ko jaan boojhkar musalamaanon ke khilaaf lakshith pratadna ke rup main chitrit karne kii pravriti ke peeche behad khatarnaak or sampradayik makasad chhipe hai
 Accusing the UPA government of succumbing to China's threats, the BJP said that due to this, the UPA government withdrew from the work of oil exploration in the South China Sea
 party ne kaha ki china par dabaav banane ke liye ye sarkaar purvi asian deshon visheshkar japan or vietnam ke saath parsparik rup se laabhprad sambandh sthapit karne main bhi vifal rahi
 Referring to Pakistan's dabepakistan due to weak leadership, BJP said that terrorists are carrying out continuous activities against India through cross-border infiltration and suicide attacks at sensitive security points in Jammu and Kashmir
 paak seemaa par bhartiya javaanon ke sir kaate jane kii ghatana se puraa desh acroshit tha
 We could not give the expected response to Pakistan due to weak leadership

 The country's credibility was tarnished, criticizing the foreign policy of the UPA, the charge sheet said that India's political clout with neighboring countries has declined, due to which neither our foreign policy nor confidence has been seen during the last five years
 Keeping security issues in view, prevent our neighbors from sitting in China's lap
 prayek padosi desh ke saath hamaari saakh dhoomil hui he
 It said that the civil nuclear agreement with the US, the relationship with that country was described as a golden age, but today with the passing of this government, our relations with America have come down to the lowest level ever

 congress ke majboot durg maane jane vaali raibareli kii siyasat nai karavat leti hui najar aa rahi he
 The battle for political supremacy has intensified only after 8 days of voting in Rae Bareli parliamentary seat
 congress kii purv adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke khilaaf chunavi maidan main bijepi se taal thokane vaale dinesh pratap singh ke khilaaf raibareli main saare virdohi ekajute ho gaye hai
 He has stepped up the exercise to oust Dinesh Pratap Singh's brother Awadhesh Singh from the chair of the District Panchayat President
 bataa den ki raibareli main jila panchayat adhyaksh avadhesh singh ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav par matdaan se pehle jile main jamkar bavaal hua
 Congress MLA from Rae Bareli Sadar, Aditi Singh was reaching the Zilla Panchayat elections for Rae Bareli from Lucknow
 aditi singh ke saath jila panchayat sadsy rakesh avasthi samet kareeb 28 jila panchayat sadsy the
 It is alleged that the District Panchayati of Awadhesh Singh survived, so Dinesh Singh's men were engaged on the whole route from Lucknow to Rae Bareli
 wo sunishchit karnaa chaahate the kisi bhi tarah aditi singh jila panchayat sadasyon ko lekar raibareli na pahunche paaen
 Despite this, Aditi Singh's convoy continued to move towards Rae Bareli
 isi bich, dabangon ne bachhraavaan-lakhanu maarg ke toll plaza par vidhayak or jila panchayat sadasyon ke vaahan par takkar maari or firing shuru kar di
 Only after firing on the members did the bullies chase the car of Sadar MLA Aditi Singh
 aarope he ki aditi singh gaadi jab gangaganj ke paas pahunchi to raibareli ke jila panchayat adhyaksh avadhesh singh rong said se aditi singh ke kafile ke saamne aa gaye
 There were about 15 vehicles with Awadhesh Singh and all had Ashahadhari
 dabangon ne congress vidhayak aditi singh ke kafile main shaamil gadiyon ko palatnaa shuru kar diya
 After this, the District Panchayat members present in the trains got down from the trains and fled
 aditi singh bhi is hamale main ghayal ho gayi
 The Dabangas kidnapped Rakesh Awasthi, a member of the District Panchayat, and assaulted him
 haalanki baad main unhen chhudaa liya gaya
 Dinesh Pratap Singh and District Panchayat President Awadhesh Singh are being blamed for all these matters
 in saare maamalon ke bich oonchaahar se sapa vidhayak manoj pandeya shahid smarak par dharne par baith gaye hai
 Actually, this war is taking place over the political dominance of Rae Bareli
 raibareli kii raajnneeti ke betaj badshaah rahe akhilesh singh in dinon biimaar chal rahe hai or unki raajnneetik viraasat aditi singh sambhaal rahi hai
 She became an MLA by winning assembly elections in 2017 with record votes
 iske baad raibareli ke nagar palika chunaav main aditi singh apane chahete ko jitaane main kaamyaab rahi hai
 The political graph of Aditi Singh is continuously increasing in the politics of Rae Bareli
 haal hi main sonia gandhi ke chunaav main bhi aditi singh ne kaaphi mehnat kii he
 The growing political influence of Aditi Singh in the politics of Rae Bareli forced Dinesh Pratap Singh to leave the Congress

 Due to this, he contested the election of Zilla Panchayat member to his brother, but he could not win
 unke bhai kii haar ke peeche dinesh pratap singh kii ahm bhoomika rahi he
 The pain of this defeat is still in Manoj Pandey's heart
 isliye manoj pandeya ne apni varshon puraani dushmani or bhai kii maut ko bhulaakar akhilesh singh se dosti kar lee he
 While Manoj Pandey's brother Rakesh Pandey was accused of murdering Akhilesh Singh
 raibareli kii siyasat se dinesh pratap singh ke varchasv ko khatm karne ke liye manoj pandeya or aditi singh ek saath khadey najar aa rahe hai
 During the Lok Sabha elections, Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi had said in a public meeting that after the election, neither Dinesh Pratap Singh nor MLC nor District Panchayat President would be able to stay

 He became the in-charge of the most favored human resource development and telecommunications ministries and his colleagues like Anand Sharma, Salman Khurshid and Jairam Ramesh were stunned

 He was also among the few who supported that agreement
 ve 1998 se hi chunaav vaale rajyon ke party pravaktaa rahe hai or chaar aam chunaav main media se mukhaatib hote rahe hai
 When Sibal started attacking the NDA by issuing a press release every day, the press conference held at his house became more popular than the press conference at the party headquarters 24 Akbar Road
 usee dauraan unhone ''paathatmak or sandarbhik'' jaise vaakyanshon kaa prayog kiya, jo patrakarita ke shabdkosh main shaamil kar liye gaye
 They have a tendency to provoke and because of this they sometimes get into trouble
 bharat-america parmaanu samajhaite kii pairvi karte samay unhen vamapanthiyon ke khilaaf hamale ko kam karne ke liye kaha gaya kyonki us samay tak ve upie ke saajheedaar the
 Recently, he introduced such subtraction in the allocation of 2G spectrum that there was no scam
 unhen fouran ehsaas ho gaya ki kuch galatfahami ho gai he or unhone fouran jaise-taise khud ko is musiibat se baahar kar liya
 His colleagues within the party and government, who are already jealous of his rise, left it to Sibal to understand the account
 sibbal kaa kahana he, ''sansad main jo maine kaha tha use dobaaraa bataa detaa hum
 You have either a 'first come first serve' policy or an auction policy
 rajg sarkaar ke samay se hi hamaare paas 'pehle aao-pehle paao' niti thi
 So, if there was a 'first come first serve' policy then the question of auction does not arise
 agar nilaamee kaa sawaal nahin uthta to ghate kaa sawaal bhi nahin uthta he
 Therefore, there was no loss
 maine yah nahin kaha ki spectrum kii nilaamee kii gai hoti to usase paisa nahin miltaa
 i never said that
 ''ve yah sweekaar karte hai ki ''meri ab tak kii sabase badi chunauti 2ji spectrum ke sambandh main dher saare uljhaav vaale muddon se nibatna rahi he
 That has definitely been my toughest challenge and it is not over yet
 '' ve un chand mantriyon main se hai jinhone na keval apane vibhinn press conferencon ke dauraan balki media kii najaron se pare apane mantralay main kaam karke dikhaaya he
 In the second term of the UPA, he has given his most important law 'right to Education Bill'
 unhone sara kaam akele karne kii apni chahat ke chalate kai aalochak bana liye hai
 He announced a proposal to finish the 10th class board examination without consulting his colleagues
 unka kahana he, ''is mudde ko cabinet ke samaksh nahin laayaa janaa tha
 It was recommended by every committee constituted since 1994 to oversee the matter
 lekin ise lagu karne ke liye koi taiyaar nahin tha
 All i did was implement those recommendations
 maine yahi jokhim mol liya
 "then they say," But until you decide and implement them, there is no change in life
 ''ab unke agenda main dak vibhaag main sudhaar karnaa shaamil he
 He says, "I am trying to bring revolution in the Department of Posts
 yah surkhiyon main nahin he kyonki yah koi aakarshak vibhaag nahin he
 "then he spreads his familiar smile, as if he has all the answers
" ''meraa maananaa he ki har mantralay bahut romaanchak he kyonki vahaan kaaphi kuch karne ko he
 Thrill is a very personal feeling, and it is felt only by your work
 vichaar yah he ki apane kaam se romaanch paidaa kiya jaae or use sankramak bana diya jaae
 "he speaks of his experience in various ministries," said the Ministry of Science and Technology needed to be brainwashed but that was very exciting
 uskaa sarokaar vichaaron se tha, bhavishya se tha
 Human resource development is basically a ministry that forces you to understand the present day reality, while the telecom ministry is the link between reality and the future
 main in teenon ko isi tarah dekhtaa hum
 As the Minister of Science and Technology, Sibal became the first MP to visit Antarctica at temperatures below zero in 2005
 lekin desh laut kar ve siyaasi maahaul ko garmane main safal ho gaye
 During the January cabinet reshuffle, many Congressmen who were eyeing the Ministry of Human Resource Development became disillusioned and Sibal got the Human Resource Development as well as the Telecom Ministry
 ab manmohan singh ek baar phir pherbadal kii yojana bana rahe hai or kisi ko nahin maaloom ki sibbal ko kya milane vaala he

 TV actor Raja Chaudhary has been arrested for allegedly acquiring a SIM card using fake documents
 oshivara thane ke nireekshak yudi kaadala ne kaha ki mehul consaaria (34) kii shikaayat par oshivara ke kaisal tower se choudhary ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 According to the police, Kansaria received two mobile phone bills for January and February, in which Raja Chaudhary's name was registered as a customer
 police ne kaha ki consaaria thane aae jahaan unhone bill dikhaate hue bataaya ki choudhary unke ghar main nahin rahete
 a case was then registered against the actor
 kisi bhi riyasat main raja ke guzarane ke baad rajkumaar ke rajtilak kii ravaayat puraani rahi he
 But if a prince has to take bail from the court for the same royalty and attend his own palace, what would you call it? This is the story of one such prince
 jise gaddi ke saath-saath uskeriyasat bhi zamaanat main mili
 Do you know what the reason was? In fact, the prince was absconding for three months for the charge of murder on his head and the coronation could not be in the absconding
 ek raja kii maut or yuvaraj ke rajtilak kii ye ek aisi ajeeb kahani he
 As before, no one has ever heard nor may anyone ever get to hear it
 kaise aayaa rajtilak main jamaanat kaa chakkar?kyonki yahaan ek raja kii maut se pehle rajkumaar baqayada court se agrim zamaanat le kar apane pita se aakiri baar milane pahunchataa he
 The father breathes his last as soon as the son arrives
 or pita ke duniya chhodte hi thik agle rose rajkumaar riyasat kii kaman sambhaal letaa he
 But the question is, why does a prince have to take advance bail to see his father for the last time and take over the throne as a king? Why does a son constantly run away from police and law despite the father lying on his bed? And why does the prince crown the crown on his head as soon as he closes his father's eyes? So, you have to return three months to find out the truth of a prince's treason and this strange coronation
 kuch kisaanon se jhagade se shuru hua kissamadhya pradesh ke devas rajgaraane main jurm kii is kahani kii shuruyaat hui 18 march ko, jab rajkumaar vikram singh apane kuch sipahasalaron ke saath mahal se takreeban 40 kilometre dur gaanv raghogarh pahunche
 Vikram Singh was claiming a piece of land here
 haalanki is zamin par in dinon raghogarh ke hi kuch kisaanon kaa kabza he or unhone baqayada is par kheti kar gehun kii fasal uga rakhi thi
 But it is said that as soon as he reached there with a team force, Kunwar saheb attacked the Lodhi family, who are harvesting wheat
 or ye hamalaa khooni jhadap main tabdeel ho gaya
 In this attack, a farmer named Pratap Lodhi and several people from his house were injured, while some people were also injured by Prince Vikram Singh
 phir faraar ho gaye rajkumaraiske baad donon taraf se ek-duusare ke khilaaf mukadmaa bhi likhvaya gaya, lekin kunwar sahab kii musiibat tab bad gai, jab jhadap ke thik do din baad aspataal main pade zakhmi kisaan pratap lodhi kii maut ho gai
 Now the case of attempt to murder registered against the prince was changed in the case of murder
 police kii dabish badi, lekin khud ko kaanoon ke hawaale karne ke bajaay rajkumaar bhaag chute
 In this connection, one by one the police arrested 11 Rajkumar's of the Rajkumar, but it was Rajkumar Vikram Singh that after the incident, there were such absconders that they could not be seen again
 yaa phir yun kahen ki police unhen nahin dekh pai
 Then the plea for anticipatory bail was given that the investigation of the case was completed
 or is silsile main 16 june ko chargeshit bhi daakhil kar di gai, lekin police ko in rajkumaar sahab kaa koi pataa nahin chalaa
 He even called Rajkumar Vikram Singh an absconder in the charge sheet
 lekin maamle tab ek nayaa mode aa gaya, jab chargeshit daakhil hone ke thik ek din baad rajkumaar to nahin, alabatta rajkumaar vikram singh ke vakil apane muvakkil or kaanoon ke is mulazim ke haq main agrim zamaanat kii fariyaad lekar adaalat kii choukhat par haazir hue
 Yes, took the plea of the advance surety of the same prince, who had been running away for the last three months with the charge of a murder-like crime on his head
 mil gai 15 din kii jamaaneb zaahir he, jab maamla ajeeb tha, to adaalat main isapar garma-garm bahes bhi lazimi thi
 So while pleading for bail, while the defense lawyers requested for bail keeping in mind the human aspects, the public prosecutor called Rajkumar as an absconder and feared his escape
 haalanki donon pakshon ko sunne ke baad adaalat ne rajkumaar ke naam 15 dinon kii agrim zamaanat kii fariyaad kubul kar lee
 After this, the princes who were not looking for the police for the last three months, also reached the hospital
 pita ke antim sanskaar main bhi shaamil hue or pita kii maut ke agle hi din rajtilak ke baad rajkaaj bhi sambhaal liya
 Although sources are to be believed, Rajkumar Vikram Singh was undoubtedly absconding in the eyes of police and law, but the fact is that he spent most of these days in his palace of Dewas and also in that hospital in Indore, where his father, BJP MLA and Raja Tukoji Rao Pawar of Dewas was admitted till now after a complaint by Brem Haemrage
 kehane kaa matlab ye ki puri duniya ne rajkumaar vikram singh ko dekha, lekin police or shashan nahin dekh pai
 The question about the role of the police in this case is also because the prince-turned-king Vikram Singh was such that no one could get any clue about him
 wo bhi aaj ke din jab mukhabiron ke jaal ke saath-saath police ke paas technical servilans kii suvidha bhi ho or har shaks mobile phone kaa istemaal bhi karata ho
 Anyway, after the passing of Raja Saheb, who had reached the last rites of the state like Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Home Minister Babulal Gaur, Congress veteran Digvijay Singh, how could his son finally reach without funeral? Therefore, it was necessary for the son to get bail

 He is kicking the mother
 uski chaati par chadh baitha he
 Can a son do so dearly to his mother
 kya koi betaa apni maa kaa munh baandhakar farsh par ghaseet-ghaseet kar maar saktaa he
 May try to strangle
 jameen par patake maa ko maraamumbai ke andheri west se aisa hi ek maamla saamne aayaa he
 The 82-year-old woman is threatened by putting a knife in her stomach

 The helpless elderly woman screams
 virodh karnaa chaahati he
 But none of its bus works
 is haivaaniyat ko ek samajasevi ne video main utaar liya
 Social activist Sundari Thakur took this video to the police with an elderly mother
 unka kahana he ki bujurg mahila ke saath ye sab teen saal se ho rahaa tha
 After getting the video, he talked to every member of the family, but the son-daughter-in-law hid the real thing
 video dekhne se pehle shaayad koi kalpana bhi nahin kar saktaa ki apana hi betaa maa ke saath itnaa krur ho saktaa he
 The eyes of the policemen were dampened after seeing the video
 lekin teen saal se maa ko buree tarah peetane vaale bete ko jaraa si bhi dayaa nahin aati
 It does not seem that there is even a little humanity left in him
 police ko shaq he ki is puri ghatana ke peeche sampatti vivaad bhi ho saktaa he
 Seeing the bestiality of the son, his mental condition also raises questions

 You must have often heard that the protest against the police is always against the police
 lekin kanpur main yah ghatana thodi alag he
 Some pro-women women also came forward to stop the women protesting against the police station here
 iske baad pradarshan karne vaali mahilaon se unki marpet ho gai
 It is not yet known whether the women who supported the police were called by the police themselves or they themselves became police advocates
 vaise badalte daur main koi bagaiyr matlab kisi ko gaali bhi nahin detaa he yah bhi dhyaan karne vaali baat he
 The women created a ruckus over the police action in a popular murder case

 is maamle main police ne pehle lalit ke naukar anil soni ko hatyara banaakar jail bheja tha

 omprakash ke parijanon kaa aarope he ki police ne lalit kii hatya main hamaare parijanon ko jail bhejnaa galat he, jabaki unki hatya khud lalit ke bete ne karai he
 The women said that the police is trapping people by taking money
 pehle police ne anil ko jail bheja tha, guuruuvaar ko uske bahanoi omprakash ko bhi jail bhej diya
 These women were protesting against the arrest at the station gate at eight o'clock at night, when some women came there and started supporting the police
 bas phir kya tha thane ke get par hi pradarshan kar rahi mahilaon ne police kaa samarthan karne waalon kii pitayee kar di
 It is worth seeing at this time that even the police on the spot did not save their supporting women from being beaten
 thane ke get par yah marpet kaa hangaamaa lagbhag teen ghante tak chalata rahaa, aakhir jab kai thanon kii police lekar espi city prabhakar choudhary maukey par aae or mahilaon ko jaanch kaa aashwaasan diya tab jaakar mahilaayein shant hui
 Shivani, who was among the women who performed, said, 'the police have sent our husband and brother to jail in a fake manner and kept them in the police station for four days
 police ne apni mahilaon ko bulaakar bulaakar ham logon se marpet karaayaa
 While the slaughter is done by the owner's boy himself
 'omprakash kii maa shanti ne kaha, 'police ne hamase bees hajaar rupaya bhi liya or kaha ki chhod denge, lekin jail bhej diya

 audio ko sunne se lagata he ki apane grih kshetra bharwari main kuch karibiyon ke khilaaf bijli adhikariyon kii karrwai ko lekar wo naaraaz the or adhishasi abhiyantaa avinaash singh ko phone par hi jamkar hadakaana shuru kar diya
 At the beginning of the audio, the voice of Executive Engineer Avinash is heard
 jisamen wo kehete hai- ‘dow
 No action has been taken against Om Prakash's hospital, his bus meter has been changed
 ’ phiravidhayak guptapoochhate hai ki exiaar kiske khilaaf hui he, is par avinaash kii ore se kaha jaataa he ki narendra kumaar ke khilaaf exiaar hui he
 Then the MLA asks who is Narendra Kumar? Avinash replies that he is the brother of Dr
 Omprakash and the meter he was using did not have a cable connected, he was using direct
 audio main vidhayak phir adhishasi abhiyantaa ko hadakaate hue kehete hai ki rajasav badhaane ke liye sirf sudharatmak karrwai kii jaae, damanaatmak nahin
 Then, using the term indecent for the electricity department and its officials, they also threaten to face the consequences
 audio main vidhayak ko abhiyantaa se ye kehete bhi suna ja saktaa he, “kabhi muslim basti main gaye hai, pehle muslim basti me jaaie abhi se, 90 fisadi bijli ve chori karte hai
 Go and check first
 ”vidhayak kaa gussa yahi shant nahin hota
 They are heard saying in the audio that 'only Hindus are being persecuted, i will go to Lucknow and talk about this
 ’ vidhayak ne ejeeniyar se ye bhi kaha ki samudaay vishesh ke logon ke khilaaf kitni exiaar darj karwaai gayi, uskaa puraa data unhen tatkaal uplabdh karaayaa jaae
 On Thursday, when Sanjay Gupta reached the office of the electricity department to collect the data, the power workers also mobilized against him
 jis vakt kaa ye audio he, usamen sanjay gupta khud kehete sunai dete hai ki wo rameswaram se aae hue hai, or unhen kshetra se logon ke bijli vibhaag ko lekar bahut phone aa rahe hai, jisase unki yatra main bhang pad gaya
 When contacted MLA Sanjay Gupta in this regard, he said that the officials of the Electricity Department have made the business of recovery
 is sandarbh main unhone bijli vibhaag ke do abhiyantaaon- tarik jameel or avinaash singh kaa naam liya
 Sanjay Gupta alleged that these officers deal in the name of action against power theft, if the money is found then it is left or else the FIR is lodged
 sanjay gupta ne ye aarope bhi lagaaya ki ek dharm vishesh ke logon se unhen paise mil rahe hai, isliye unke khilaaf karrwai nahin kii jaati
 It is being told that Sanjay Gupta threatened to restore electricity to those whose homes have been cut off and firs have been made, as well as firs to be withdrawn
 bataa den ki in dinon upi main avaidh bijli ke khilaaf bijli vibhaag kaa abhiyaan chal rahaa he
 After granting deferment for a particular time, the Yogi government is not only cutting all illegal connections but also collecting fines
 FIR bhi darj ho rahi hai
 Not only Hindus but many Muslim-dominated areas have also run such campaigns
 pashchimi uttar pradesh ke kai jilon main kai musalamaanon ke ghar lage avaidh bijli ke conection or katiyaa kaate gaye hai
 firs have also been registered in many places
 baharhaal aapattijanak video ke saamne aane ke baad bhi vidhayak sanjay gupta ko apane kahe par koi pachhtaawaa nahin
 On the contrary, he is adamant that some people in the electricity department only harass Hindus while they do not take action against people belonging to a particular community
 vidhayak ke mutabik yahi soch unke kshetra ke logon kii he
 The MLA alleged that these engineers of the electricity department are doing this to tarnish the image of him and the government
 vidhayak sanjay gupta ke aaropon ko adhishasi abhiyantaa avinaash singh ne khaarij kiya
 Avinash described himself as hurt by the threat of the MLA and expressed his desire to be transferred from the region
 unhone kaha ki shashan ke aadesh par hi bijli ke avaidh conection waalon ke khilaaf karrwai kii ja rahi he
 If action is taken against some such people, an attempt is being made to pressurize the MLA
 uttar pradesh keupamukhyamantrikeshav prasad maury ke kareebi maane jane vaale vidhayak gupta guuruuvaar ko bijli vibhaag ke daftar ke get par pahunchakar vahaan par karrwai kaa data maangane lage to daftar main koharaam much gaya
 The employees of the electricity department sat on the dharna and raised slogans in protest against the behavior of the MLA and the threat given to the officers of the department
 bijli karmchaariyon kaa kahana he ki unke khilaaf kisi tarah kaa ection liya gaya to vah samuhik avkaash par chale jaaenge

 tamaam virodh or maang ke bich aakhirkaar karnataka kii siddharamaiya sarkaar nedhiash dike raviki maut kaa maamla sibiai ko saunpane kaa nirnay kiya
 After recommendation from the Center on Monday, the state government has submitted the investigation report so far in the High Court
 isamen postmortem report ke saath hi iees kii bachmet kaa bayaan bhi shaamil he
 In the report, the government has clarified that there were more 'relations' between Ravi and his female batchmate than the common friendship and this includes financial transactions
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle court ne siddharamaiya sarkaar se sadan main is report pesh karne par roak laga di thi
 In a sealed cover to the CID report from the government, Advocate General Pro
 ravi verma kumaar ne court ko saunpa
 a writ petition was filed by Sudhir Reddy, husband of Ravi's female batchmate Rohini Sindhuri, under which the report was submitted
 maamle main sudhir ne court se antarim aadesh liya tha, jiske baad vidhansabha main report kii peshi par roak lag gai thi
 The government on its part appealed to the High Court to allow it to present the report in the House
 sarkaar ne daleel di ki ravi kii bachmet maut maamle kii ahm kadi he
 Advocate General said that the government has not taken the name of the woman officer in the report and considered it a case of privacy
 sarkaar ne report main likhaa he ki ravi mahila bachmet ke saath apane rishton ko dosti se aage badhanaa chahta tha
 Advocate General Kumar also referred to Ravi's call details and messages in the court, in which Ravi had called 44 times on the woman's phone on the day of death
 postmortem report kaa zikr karte hue unhone bataaya ki teen doctoron ne is ore jaanch ke baad pushti kii he ki ravi kii maut faansee lagane se hui he
 Kumar said that the government should be empowered to present the report in the House, because the government is not able to clarify the allegations being made by the media due to this ban
 kumaar ne kaha, 'report ko pesh karne par roak ne sarkaar ke haath baandh die hai
 'it is worth mentioning that earlier in this regard, the woman batchmate also told the investigating officer that Ravi used to talk to her repeatedly to leave her husband

 This comment was made about the state where according to official sources, more than five lakh posts ranging from Gram Sevika Asha to Group "C" are vacant
 inter collejon main ek lakh se adhik pad khaali hai
 70% of the posts of Principal are vacant in these colleges and the condition of high schools is that in many districts the same headmaster is taking charge of four-four schools

 The result is that appointments from the High Court or Supreme Court are prohibited
 jaraa dekhie, 2011 main shuru hui 70,000 se adhik primary shikshakon kii bhartee kaa maamla supreme court main atka he
 The case of rigging in PCS-2011 was first raised by India Today from the news published in June 2014 titled "yadavraj in PCS-2011" and now the Commission is reprimanding the High Court for this
 2011 main 4,000 daaroga kii bhartee main niyukti patr baantne par hycourt ne 7 agast, 2015 ko roak laga di
 Avneesh Pandey, Coordinator of Student Conflict Committee, challenging the recruitments in the court, says, "in a state with a population of 20 crores, a whole generation of crores of unemployed are getting overexposed waiting for the preparation and success of the government job and Akhilesh government is corrupting the corrupt Is working to give protection ”unki baat jachati bhi he, kyonki pichley maheene elahabaad hycourt ne madhyamik shiksha seva chayan board kii adhyaksh anitha yadav or ucchtar shiksha seva chayan board ke adhyaksh ramvir singh yadav ke kaam karne par roak laga di
 Later, both the presidents had to be appointed in a hurry
 vahiin, upipiessi adhyaksh kii niyukti kii file dekhne ke baad hycourt ne poocha ki aakhir anil yadav main aisi koun-si yogyata thi jo baaki 82 daavedaaron ko darkinar kar unhen is pad par baithaaya gaya? yahi nahin, mainpuri ke dm ne ek din ke bheetar, vah bhi ravivaar ko lekhpal, tehseeldaar, esadm sabase report lekar unhen charitra pramaan patr bhi de diya
 The High Court has asked the government whether it has any process to appoint the chairman or not
 This is the first shameful coincidence in the history of the state when the High Court has taken such a strict stand on the chairman of the three major commissions giving government jobs
 uttar pradesh ke ritred iees adhikari badal chatarji sawaal karte hai, “aise maamalon main dm espi ke madhyam se report mangaata he

 "in such a situation, these tainted recruitments can pose much bigger problems for the" youthful vigor "government than the problems faced by Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan in Madhya Pradesh's infamous Vocational Examination Board (vyapam) scam

 As it is, the case in Vyapam is of rigging in small-scale jobs, while there are direct allegations of rigging in the three major commissions and other types of top government jobs
 in aaropon ke baad lazim tha ki prakriya ko paardarshee banane kii koshish kii jaati, lekin uttar pradesh ulti disha main ja rahaa he
 After being accused of rigging recruitment in PCS-2011, the commission did the first thing that the names of successful candidates in PCS stopped making public

 When the students alleged that the numbers in the copies of the main examination were being given incorrectly, the commission made arrangements to burn the copies of the main examination within a year
 dhyaan rahe ki ghotaale ko sangrakshan dene ke liye madhya pradesh main bhi kapiyaan teen maheene ke bheetar jalaane kaa intjaam kar diya gaya tha
 The situation is that no one knows whether the PCS-2012 copies are now or have been destroyed
 ek artiai ke jawaab main ayog ne kaha ki kapiyaan nasht kar di gai hai, jabaki duusari artiai par kaha ki chaatr aakar apni copy dekh sakate hai
 When India Today asked the Secretary of the Commission, Rizwan Ur Rehman, what is the status of the copies of PCS-2012, he said, “I have no information about this
 ” yahi nahin, ayog kii karypranali par uth rahe sawaalon ko unhone puri tarah managasaint or bebuniyaad bataakar khaarij kar diya

 Yesterday Shiv Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray had beaten up former Maharashtra Chief Minister and Speaker Manohar Joshi, while today Manohar Joshi retorted that his protest at Dussehra rally was pre-planned

 You can say it if you want
 lekin phir thakare par nishaanaa sadhate hue vah bole ki agar party netritv chahta, to in chizon se behatar dhang se nipat saktaa tha
 Manohar Joshi said that i have written a letter to Uddhav Thackeray about this

 lekin ye sach he ki us din shiv sainikon ne galati kii
 Then to demonstrate his humility, Joshi also said that he is a party worker like Shiv Sainik
 mujhe pehle hi pataa tha, beijjati hogimanohar joshi ne kaha ki mujhe bura lag rahaa he
 It shouldn't have happened

 a special CBI court in Ghaziabad rejected Rajesh Talwar's application in which he had asked the investigating agency to submit the documents submitted along with the filing report regarding the closure of the murder of his daughter Aarushi
 adaalat ne kaha ki unhen maamle ko band karne ke sambandh main agency kii report saunpi ja chuki he
 The court will further hear the matter on 25 January
 adaalat ne apane aadesh main kaha, siarpisi kii dhara 207 ke tahat praavdhaan he ki abhiyukt ko ve saare dastavej die jane chahie jiske aadhaar par uske khilaaf aaropapatr daayar kiya gaya he taaki adaalat main vah apana bachaav kar sake
 The court said, but in the present case, the CBI has filed a report to close the case
 aisi sthiti main aavedak (rajesh talwaar) ko abhiyukt kii shrenee main nahin rakhaa ja saktaa he jaisaa adaalat ne apane pichley aadesh main kaha tha
 Also, a copy of the documents cannot be given to the first informer
 adaalat ne kaha, jab tak maamle ko band karne se sambandhit report par faisla nahin kar liya jaataa tab tak shikayatakarta yaa kisi anya yachikakarta ko prati nahin di ja sakati
 Therefore the application is rejected

 Oil companies say that we lose 6 rupees 43 paise on a liter of petrol
 agar bikri kar jod den to ghate se bachane ke liye keemat 7 rupye 72 paise prati litre tak badhaane honge
 Obviously, if the oil companies just run, then they should put the entire burden on you, but there are some situations and some have to show that despite the losses, these oil companies are also concerned about the common people
 isliye ehsaan ye karenge ki har litre par bas 3-4 rupye tak hi keemat badhayenge
 a meeting of the country's oil companies is scheduled to take place later this afternoon
 isi main faisla honevaala he ki keemat kitni badhaai jaae
