 lekin vidhayakon ke vetan badhaane ke prastaav kii congress or bijepi ne aalochana kii he
 Congress leader Ajay Maken has said that this party is no longer the common man, in five months their mlas have started talking about increasing salary
 dilli vidhaan sabha main netaa vipaksh vijendra gupta ne kaha he ki agar sarkaar ek rupee maheenaa vetan kaa prastaav laae to teen vidhayakon kaa unka vidhayak dal samarthan karegaa
 While respecting the spirit of Vijendra Gupta, it should be asked how he can live in this inflation for one rupee a month
 unki aay kaa zariyaa kya he
 Do they have enough money to live without earning? agar he to ve yah tarika mujhe bhi bataa den to yakeen jaaniye ye meraa aakhri prime time hoga
 i will not come to work from Monday
 balki vijendra gupta ji ko tatkaal prabhaav se centre main vitt mantri banaaya jaae
 Don't just make them in charge of the ex-servicemen sitting on hunger strike for one rank one pension, else Gupta will mess up
 ummid he gupta ji meri baat kaa bura nahin maanenge lekin ek rupee main jeene kaa yah tarika mil jaae to aap darshakon kaa bhi bahut bhala hoga
 If the BJP obeyed them and paid the salary of their mlas in all the states for one rupee, then a mini revolution has happened

 There is a proposal to increase 100 percent
 bataaiye dilli main vidhayak ek rupaya or saansad ek lakh kamaaye mujhase to nahin dekha jayega
 My heart is being torn
 aap apane is ankar ko sambhaaliye
 Leave the Aam Aadmi Party, get a Nobel Prize on this formula of one rupee salary
 aap darshakon ko bhi ek rupee vetan ke vijendra formula ko apana lenaa chahie, yakeen kiijie yoga kii bhi zarurat nahin padegi
 Recalling the ex-servicemen sitting on the demand for One Rank One Pension, apologizing to them, i now ask you whether you also believe that the salary of Delhi mlas is very high
 badhaane kii zarurat nahin he
 Leader of Opposition in Delhi Legislative Assembly Vijendra Gupta has said that his MLA party will support three mlas if the government brings a proposal for one rupee per month salary
 vijendra gupta ji kii bhaavana kaa sammaan karte hue yah poocha janaa chahie ki ve is mahangaai main ek rupee maheene par kaise ji sakate hai
 What is their source of income
 kya unke paas itnaa paisa he ki bina kamaaye ji sakate hai
 If they tell me this method too, then know for sure that this will be my last prime time
 main somvaar se kaam par nahin aauungaa
 Rather, Vijendra Gupta should be made Finance Minister at the Center with immediate effect
 sirf inhen van rank van pension ke liye bhukh hadtaal par baithe purv sainikon ke maamle kaa prabharee na banaaya jaae varna gupta ji or gadabad kar denge
 Hopefully, Gupta will not mind my words, but if you get this way of living in one rupee, then you audience will also be very good
 agar bijepi ne unki baat maan kar sabhi rajyon main apane vidhayakon kii selary ek rupee kar di to ek mini kranti to ho hi gai samajhiye
 The comments yahi nahin dilli bijepi vidhayak dal ko apana prastaav centre sarkaar ko bhi bhejnaa chahie ki saansadon kaa vetan bhi ek rupaya kar diya jaae
 According to reports, the committee of his party MP Yogi Adityanath has suggested to increase the salary of mps because the work of mps is not going on in three and a half lakh rupees a month
 100 pratishat badhaane kaa prastaav hota he
 Tell me that the MLA in Delhi earns one rupee and MP one lakh, i will not be seen
 meraa kalejaa fata ja rahaa he
 You hold this anchor of your own
 chhodiye aam aadmi party ko, ek rupee ke vetan ke is formule par nobel puraskaar dilavaaiye
 You viewers should also adopt the Vijendra formula of one rupee salary, believe that yoga will not be needed
 van rank van pension kii maang par baithe purv sainikon ko yaad karte hue, unase kshamaa maangate hue ab aapse sawaal karata hum ki kya aap bhi maanate hai ki dilli ke vidhayakon kii selary bahut zyaada he
 No need to increase
 balki vijendra gupta ji ko tatkaal prabhaav se centre main vitt mantri banaaya jaae
 Don't just make them in charge of the ex-servicemen sitting on hunger strike for one rank one pension, else Gupta will mess up

 8, front- 8mpbetri:3,000mah Bollywood movies show dozens of ways to impress a girl, with inspiration, boys often try to adopt them in real life too
 par reel life or real life donon ek-duusare se bilkul alag hai
 Whatever is easily done on the screen has to be very difficult to do in reality
 khaastaur par agar aap kisi bhartiya ladki koimpress karne kii koshish kar rahe hanto ye baat jahan main bitha len ki ye ek bahut mushkil kaam he
 Indian girls are the most difficult to impress but with these measures you can easily impress an Indian girl: 1
 bhartiya ladakiyon ko ve ladke bahut impress karte hai jo techno-friendli hote hai
 The girls guess their smartness by this
 unhen lagata he ki agarsamne vaala ladakaatechnolji se judaa hua he to wo samay ke saath chalane waalon main se he
 He is not backward
 kam shabdon main kahen to bhartiya ladakiyon ko 'gik' kism ke ladke bahut bhaate hai
 Especially those who complete their numerous requests online without going anywhere
 2
 You might not believe it but Indian girls notice everything in the boy
 ve ladke ke dressing sens se bhi unhen jaj karti hai
 Notice how your clothes are, what kind of shoes you are wearing and what kind of accessories you are wearing
 wo juuton par bhi puraa dhyaan detii hai
 If you are wearing sports shoes with formal wear, then your impression may get worse and if you have worn casual flip-flops, do not forget to clean your nails
 3
 If you are a magician of words, then it can be of benefit to you
 par aisa bhi nahin he ki ladki se milte hi aap use baari-baari shabdon kaa dose dene lagen lekin agar aap sahaj shabdon main apni baat kah sakate hai to ye aapke liye plus point ho saktaa he
 4
 agar aap physicli feet hai or aapaki persenality ataractive he to ladkiya jaldi impress hoti hai
 Boys are particularly fond of running girls in the morning
 par iskaa matlab ye bilkul nahin he ki aapkaa sharir body-builder ke jaisaa ho, ladakiyon ko body-builder se zyada feet ladke suhate hai
 5
 ladki ko ye ehsaas karana bahut jaruri he ki aap use bahut adhik pasand karte hai
 For this, you can also assure him by holding his hand
 haath par chumkar bhi pyaar kaa izhaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Girls want physically fit, mind-smart and loving boys for themselves
 agar aapmen ye sabhi gun he to unhen sahi tareeke se pesh karke aap ladki ko impress kar sakate hai

 mannaton kii chhath aa gai he
 This day is also celebrated as the day of worship of Maa Shashthi and Surya
 yah parv ugte surya ke saath hi duubate surya kii puja kar unase vardaan paane kaa he
 On this day, the nectar will be scattered on the pier with the rays of the sun
 har arghya ke saath dukh katataa chalaa jayega or puri aapaki sabhi kamanaayen ho jaaengi
 Chhath means the day of worship, to ask for vows and to thank the blessings given by God
 surya kii upasna or mata shashti kii bhakthi karne kaa ye iklauta aisa parv he jisamen na keval ugte suraj balki duubate suraj kii bhi upasna kii jaati he
 Devotees start preparing for this biggest festival of Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh only after Diwali
 aisa jaruri bhi he, kehete hai is puja main hui ek choti si chook unki puri mehnat par pani pher detii he
 In such a situation, the devotees leave no stone unturned to please the Goddess on their behalf
 karthik shukla kii chhathi ke din aane vaala ye parv chaar din kaa hota he
 For self purification on the first day i
e
 Chaturthi, devotees eat only Arva i
e
 take a pure diet
 iske baad panchami ko bhakt snaan ke baad puja paath karte hai
 After that, in the evening, make pudding of jaggery and new rice and worship the sixth mother with fruits and sweets
 iske baad kunvaari kanyaon or brahmanon ko khaanaa khilaakar bhakt is khil ko prasad ke taur par grahan karte hai
 After this comes the most important day i
e
 Shashti, on which the sun is worshiped
 is din bhakt puure din upwas rakhte hai
 For the worship of mother, every kind of dish is made and seven kinds of fruits are filled in bamboo branches and go to the banks of river or pond
 yahaan ganne kaa ghar banaakar diya jalaate hai or duubate suraj ko arghya dete hain
 This arghya is given by standing in water up to the waist
 suraj dhalane ke baad bhakt ghar aate hai or phir jaagran hota he
 On the day of Saptami, people again gather on the banks of a river or pond in the Brahma Muhurta and then arghya is offered to the rising sun
 bhakt ankurit chane haath main lekar shashthee vrath kii katha kehete or sunate hai
 Prasad is distributed after the narrative and then everyone returns to their respective homes
 vrath karne vaale is din parayan karte hai
 Chhath is also known as the Festival of Mannat
 iske mahatv kaa isi baat se andaaza lagaaya ja saktaa he ki isamen kisi galati ke liye koi jagah nahin hoti
 Therefore, with purity and cleanliness, tremendous purity is taken care of in this festival with body and mind
 is tyohaar ko jitne man se mahilaayein rakhti hai purush bhi puure josho-kharosh se is tyohaar ko manaate hai auki vrath rakhte hai
 The history of this mahaparva, which lasts for four days for the worship of Surya worship and the sixth maiya, is also very old
 puraanon main aisi kai kathaayen hai jisamen maa shashthee sang suryadev kii puja kii baat rahi gayi he, phir chaahe wo tretayug main bhagwaan ram hon yaa phir surya ke samaan putr karn kii mata kunti
 There are many stories in the tradition about Chhath Puja
 ram kii suryapujakahate hai surya or shashthi maa kii upasna kaa ye parv treta yug main shuru hua tha
 When Lord Rama conquered Lanka and returned to Ayodhya after killing Ravana, he worshiped Suryadev on Kartik Shukla's Shashthi and sought his blessings
 jab khud bhagwaan suryadev kii upasna karen to bhala unki praja kaise peeche rah sakati thi
 Seeing Rama, everyone started fasting and worshiping Shashthi
 kehete hai usee din se bhakt shashti yani chhath kaa parv manaate hai
 Another belief associated with the story of King Priyavrata is that once a king Priyavrata and his wife performed a son-sage sacrifice for getting children
 lekin unki santan paidaa hote hi is duniya ko chhodkar chali gai
 Unhappy with the death of the child, Priyabrata went to commit suicide, then Shashti Devi appeared and told him that if you worship me, you will get children
 raja ne shashti devi kii puja kii jisase unhen putr kii prapti hui
 It is said that since then Chhath Puja is done
 kunti karn kathakhte hai ki kunti jab kunvaari thim tab unhone rishi durvasa ke vardaan kaa satya jaanane ke liye surya kaa aahvaan kiya or putr kii ichha jataai
 Surya gave Karni the mighty and danveer son like Karna to the virgin Kunti
 ek manyata ye bhi he ki karn kii tarah hi parakramee putr ke liye surya kii aradhana kaa naam he chhath parv
 The fast starts with nahai-khay
 pujan saamagree kisi kaaran se juthi na ho, is kaaran pujan saamagree ko rakhane ke liye gharon kii safai kii jaati he
 If the worship material becomes stubborn or unholy, then the festival becomes fragmented and is considered inauspicious
 nahaay-khaay ke din se hi vratadhari jameen par sote hai
 Satvik food is made for everyone in the house
 duusare din puure din vrath kar chandramaa nikalne ke baad vratadhari gud kii kheer kaa prasad khate hai
 Pumpkin vegetable is eaten exclusively on this day
 sthaneey bolchaal main ise kaddu-bhaat kehete hai
 With the pumpkin-bhaat, a 36-hour fast for the fast begins
 is dauraan vratadhari ann or jal grahan nahin karte hai
 On the third day, after fasting, the sun is standing in the river and the pond, offering prayers
 chauthe din subah ugte surya ko kand-mul va gaay ke doodh se arghya dene ke saath hi yah vrath sampann hota he
 After the end of the fast, the first person takes the form of prasad and then takes food
 surya upasna kaa mahaparv chhath mukhya rup se pati or putr kii lambii umr ke saath-saath sukh-samruddhi ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Sun is worshiped in this festival
 chhath puja ke niyam itane kade hai ki is vrath ko karne se pehle tan-man se mahilaon ko shuddh hona padataa he or ghar kii tamaam chizon kii saaf-safai kii jaati he
 Those who are unable to buy the contents of Chhath Puja, they buy donations from others and buy the worship material
 vibhinn pradeshon or yahaan tak ki duusare deshon main rahane vaale log bhi harshollas se is parv ko manaate hai
 Now this festival is gradually becoming popular in other states as well, but no matter where the devotees are, they do not forget to follow the rules of Chhath Puja

 Rick Capaldi, who has written several books on parenting, gave a model in his latest book, 21st Century Parenting
 
 
 'thri aar' kaa
 He says, "the world is getting faster
 kariyar se lekar vyaktigat jindagi tak kathinaaiyaan pehle ke mukaable lagaataar bad rahi hai
 
 
 And faster, and faster
 
 
 
 The race is fierce
 maa-baap bhi daud rahe hai
 Children too
 kahaan gayi ve daadi-nani kii kahaniyaan? buaa-chachaa ke saath ghanton khelnaa ab to khwab hi he
 When the father scolded, the mother saved him
 maa bigadi to daadi ne or daadi bhi naaraaz hui to chachaa ne bachche ko dulra diya
 Aunt, aunt-aunt don't know how many relationships
 
 
 par ab kahaan?''capaldi kii yah baat bhartiya parivesh main bhi galat to nahin
 No royal children can be seen
 kisase bataaen ki unke man main kya chal rahaa he? shaadi yaa kariyar jaise faisle jindagi ko badalane vaale hote hai
 It is not that every time children are wrong, it is not that only parents are wrong
 galat he to ek duusare ko na samajhnaa
 Capladi's magical 'three r'-reed means understanding the environment around your child, understanding his challenges, and the impact of who and how much
 uske swabhaav main kya badlaav aa rahe hai
 Regulate and develop emotional control means how a child resolves his emotional issues
 badali paristhiyon ke prati kaise pratikriya karata he
 Is he considering himself as a prisoner? khud ko peedit to nahin samaj rahaa, in sabakaa asar uske vyaktitv par to nahin pad rahaa
 He does not feel that you are imposing your decisions on him

 bacchon ko unke vajood se waakif karana, unke bheetar jindagi ke prati aashaa bharna, sahi or galat ke bich fark karnaa, kai baar lagaataar ignorance kii vajah se bachche vidhvansak ho jate hai
 Actually the process of 3R is to make the child aware of his 'existence'
 yah ladaai bahut bachapan main shuru hoti he
 Seeking your own survival at home among your siblings
 maa-baap se sweekruti paane kii jaddojahad or phir doston ke bich pahchaan banane kii kashmakash or phir duniya main
 This search for existence goes on continuously
 aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki ghar main ‘vajood’ kii talash main niraash baccha baahar ise talaashe, talash us bharose kii door kii bhi hoti he jiskaa zikr hamane upar kiya he
 Many times from far away, Marichika looks like waves of water

 And then gets frustrated

 Now here comes your 'intention'
 kya bachche kaa hit aapke liye sarvopari he? yaa kathith taur par aapaki samaajik pratishtha?agar aap maa-baap hai to khud se puuchhie kya in thri main kis aar ko apane ‘miss’ kiya
 The basic mantra is that do not let the child lose trust between you

 The verdict may be wrong as well

 To deal with such a situation, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar held an important meeting at his residence on Sunday

 In these important decisions taken, the amount of diesel subsidy for farmers has been increased by Rs 50
 pehle ek litre dijal par 40 rupee kaa anudaan tha
 Right now the price of one liter diesel is around 73 rupees
 kisaanon ko 50 rupee sarkaar degi to unhen ek litre par 23 rupee hi kharch karne honge

 76 saal kii umr main barmer se chunaav ladane ke icchhuk jaswant singh achaanak behad bhavuk ho gaye
 While talking to the media, his eyes were deceived
 jaswant singh kehane lage ki 'abhi jo kuch ho rahaa he, vastav main yahi antar he asli or nakli bijepi main
 There has been a kind of encroachment on the BJP
 to ye atikaraman kyon hone diya gaya he
 This is an ideological violation
 ' jaswant singh ne yah bayaan jaipur pahunch kar diya
 He has not got a BJP ticket from Barmer
 19 agast, 2009 ko shimla ke ek paanch sitara hotel main bhi jaswant singh kii ankhen isi tarah bhar ai thim
 On that day too, he had said similar things about the BJP
 us din unhen bijepi se nikaal diya gaya tha
 The reason was that he had pointed fingers at Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel for the partition of the country in a book written on the founder of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Jinnah
 2009 kii haar ke baad laalkrishna adwani ke ghar hui baithak main jaswant singh ne haar ke liye jimmedaar logon par karrwai kii maang kii thi
 He suggested a link between the result and the award
 mana gaya ki unka ishaara arun jetali kii ore tha, jo 2009 ke prachaar ke prabharee the, magar haar ke baad unhen rajyasabha main vipaksh kaa netaa bana diya gaya tha
 The question arises as to why Jaswant Singh asks questions about BJP only when things are not as per his mind
 1996 or 1998 se lekar 2004 tak jaswant singh atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar main vaajapeyi, adwani ke baad tisare number par rahe
 He played a big role in all the big decisions
 lekin sarkaar par pakad bana kar rakhane vaale jaswant singh 2004 main haar ke baad se party par pakad nahin bana paae
 He had a confrontation with Vasundhara Raje in his home state of Rajasthan
 vaajapeyi ke kareebi maane jane vaale jaswant, adwani ke najadik ho gaye
 He supported Advani in the Jinnah controversy
 sangh ne unhen kabhi pasand nahin kiya
 This time Vasundhara has become more powerful
 rajasthan main bijepi ko aitihaasik bahumat mila he
 Vasundhara is one of the few leaders of the party who has come forward openly in support of Narendra Modi
 madhya pradesh kii tulana main vasundhara ne rajasthan chunaav main modi se khub prachaar karavaaya or jab jeetin, to modi ko shrey dene main kanjusee bhi nahin barti
 For the Lok Sabha elections, there was only one scale to decide candidates for each seat - win
 jab jaswant singh kii baat ai, to unhen barmer ke bajaae jodhpur se ummidavaar banane kaa prastaav diya
 But obviously Jaswant could not stand from there due to his relationship with the Jodhpur royal family
 jab party ne jaswant ko barmer se khadaa karne par jor diya to unki ore se saaf kiya gaya ki party soch le use rajasthan main ek seat chahie yaa choubees
 Rajasthan BJP believes that giving tickets to Jat leader Colonel Sonaram Chaudhary is more important
 mujffarnagar dangon ke baad jat bijepi kii ore aane lage the
 But as soon as the UPA government has talked about Jat reservation, their attitude once again seems to be towards Congress and Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal
 ek taqatvar jat netaa ko maidan main utaarne se sirf rajasthan hi nahin, balki haryana or pashchimi uttar pradesh main bhi sandesh jaataa he
 The RSS had made it clear that new blood should be given a chance in this election instead of aged leaders
 rahi baat jaswant singh kii, to unke bete maanavendra ek baar loksabhaa saansad rah chuke hai
 Currently, there are party mlas from Barmer district
 party netaa jaswant singh ko unke saathi yashavanth sinha kii yaad bhi dilaa rahe hai, jo is baar apane bete ko jharkhand kii hazaribagh seat se tikat dilaa kar chunavi raajnneeti se dur ho gaye hai
 So, is that why Jaswant Singh suddenly started seeing the real BJP and fake BJP
 party par vaicharik atikaraman dikhne laga he
 His supporters have started erasing Narendra Modi's photo printed between Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani
 ain chunaavon ke vakt bagawati tevar dikhaane ke peeche ek ummid yah bhi he ki bijepi ke andruni jhagadon ke saamne aane se party ke paksh main bana maahaul bigade
 Some people in the BJP are asking questions that even if Jaswant Singh had got a ticket from Barmer, he would have talked about the real-fake BJP
 shimla chintan baithak ke samay jab unhen bijepi se nikaala gaya or jab adwani ke kehane par unki vaapasi hui, tab vah asli bijepi thi yaa phir nakli? or party par ho rahe vaicharik atikaraman ke bare main unka munh tabhi kyon khulaa jab unka tikat cat gaya?

 Marriage brings a big change in life
 shaadi ke baad insaan ke swabhaav main kai saare parivartan dekhne ko milte hai
 His gesture and way of life suddenly change
 ham bataa rahe hai wo 8 badlaav jo ek purush main shaadi ke baad dekhne ko milte hai
 It is a feeling of responsibility - It is a responsibility to fulfill a relationship
 shaadi ke baad ladke zyada jimmedaar ho jate hai
 Their childishness decreases and they look very mature
 ve apni jimmedaariyon se waakif hone lagate hai or unhen rishton kii pehle se zyada phikr hone lagati he
 Aloe vera is a treatment for obesity, this is how it is used
 Being divided - being alone sometimes gives a pleasant feeling
 is dauraan aap jivan ke sukhad palon ke akele maalik hote hai or usamen kisi ke hastkshep kii dur-dur tak koi sambhaavna nahin hoti
 After marriage, your personal space is not left as before
 ab aapako har choti-badi cheez apni patni or parivaar ke saath baantni padati he
 Even you have to share the bathroom
 shaadi ke baad pehle apni patni ke saath or phir bacchon ke saath aapako apana vakt baantnaa padataa he
 Have to be socially active - marriage is not only the meeting of two people, but the meeting of two families
 shaadi ke baad kai rishte-naate hamase jud jate hai jinke prati hamen javabdeh hona padataa he
 Relationships are very fragile, so after marriage they have to take special care
 haalanki kuch logon ko ekant pasand hota he or ve zyada soshali active nahin rahete hai
 For such people, it is a big challenge after marriage
 sikh jaataa he care karnaa-shaadi se pehle aadmi ko khud kii sud nahin rahati he
 He does not even take proper care of his things
 shaadi ke baad is laaparvaahee or beficri kii jagah jimmedaari le leti he or wo apane jeevanasathi kii bhi dekh-rekh karne lag jaataa he
 After marriage, he has to give equal time to every relationship
 patni ke aane ke baad use apane maa-baap, bhai-bahan ke saath-saath baaki sage-sambandhiyon ke liye samay nikaalnaa hota he
 With this, he learns to make rapport between relationships
 chhot jaati hai mastiyaan-bachalers aksar nitout pe janaa pasand karte hai
 They roam freely and have fun with their friends
 shaadi ke baad unako apane is sukh kaa tyaag karnaa padataa he
 For him, giving time to his life partner gets added to his priorities
 apane shauk se karnaa padataa he samjhauta-shaadi ke baad jimmedaariyaan badhane kii vajah se insaan ko apane shauk ko peeche chhodana padataa he
 Along with the job, he also has to give time to his family, after which he does not have time to complete his hobby-e-sukun
 bhavishya ko lekar satark-jivan main nae humsafar ke aate hi insaan ke upar use santusht rakhane kii phikr bhi janm lene lagati he
 He becomes alert about his health, his desires, his safety

 karthik maheene kii devuthni ekadshi ko puure chaar maheene tak sone ke baad jab bhagwaan vishnu jaagate hai to sabase pehle tulsi se vivaah karte hai
 Tulsi is very dear to Lord Vishnu and Srihari can be pleased only by offering Tulsi Dal
 jo log tulsi vivaah sampann karaate hai, unako vaivaahik sukh miltaa he
 According to a blessing given to the demon girl Vrinda, Lord Vishnu was born in an incarnation of Shaligram to marry Vrinda
 prabodhini ekadshi ke din bhagwaan vishnu ne shaligram ke avatar main tulsi se vivaah kiya tha
 That is why Tulsi is worshiped every year on Prabodhini Ekadashi
 aage jaaniye, vrinda naam kii rakshas kanya kaise bani tulsi or kaise hua vishnu ke saath tulsi kaa vivaah
 
 
 According to Hindu scriptures, there was a girl named Vrinda
 vrinda kaa vivaah samudr manthan se utpann hue jalandhar naam ke rakshas se kar diya gaya
 Vrinda was a loving woman with a devotee of Lord Vishnu, due to which her husband Jalandhar became even more powerful
 yahaan tak ki devon ke dev mahadev bhi jalandhar ko parajeet nahin kar paa rahe the
 The gods, including Lord Shiva, prayed to Lord Vishnu to destroy Jalandhar
 bhagwaan vishnu ne jalandhar kaa bhesh dhaaran kiya or pativrata stri vrinda kii pavitrataa nasht kar di
 When the sanctity of Vrinda was over, the power of Jalandhar came to an end and Lord Shiva killed Jalandhar
 vrinda ko jab bhagwaan vishnu kii maaya kaa pataa chalaa to vah cruddh ho gai or unhen bhagwaan vishnu ko kaala pathar banane (shaligram pathar) shraap de diya
 Vrinda cursed Lord Vishnu that he would separate from his wife
 ram ke avatar main bhagwaan sita mata se alag hote hai
 Seeing God as stone, all the gods and goddesses became angry, then Goddess Lakshmi prayed to Vrinda, then Vrinda withdrew her curse for the welfare of the world and herself became sati with Jalandhar
 phir unki raakh se ek paudha niklaa jise bhagwaan vishnu ne tulsi naam diya or khud ke ek rup ko pathar main samahit karte hue kaha ki aaj se tulsi ke bina main prasad sweekaar nahin karunga
 This stone will be worshiped along with Tulsi in the name of Shaligram
 karthik maheene main tulsi ji kaa shaligram ke saath vivaah bhi kiya jaataa he
 Those who conduct Tulsi marriages get marital happiness
 devotthana ekadshi par keval tulsi vivaah hi nahin hota he
 Due to the auspicious effects of this fast, all the obstacles in the marriage begin to be removed and the sum of auspicious marriage is soon formed

 The state government on Thursday got the new Sports Bill passed in the assembly amid heavy uproar by the BJP
 iske saath hi echpisie samet pradesh ke 42 khel sanghon par sarkari niyantran kaa rasta saafe ho gaya he
 The BJP alleges that the new law has been brought with the intention of seizing the HPCA
 philhal hamirpur se bijepi saansad or purv mukhyamantri prem kumaar dhumal ke bete anuraag thakur echpisie ke adhyaksh hai
 Under the new law, all sports associations will have to change their rules so that elections can be held every four years in a democratic manner
 ab sarkaar khel samitiyon ke chunaav se lekar bahi-khaaton par nazar rakh sakegi
 However, to avoid government control, it has already been made a company by changing the rules of HPCA
 lekin congress sarkaar kaa kahana he ki dharmashala main stadium or sports retreat ke liye echpisie ko riyayati daron par zamin bataur samiti di gai thi
 So now either HPCA returns the land or get it registered as a committee
 vipaksh ke netaa prem kumaar dhumal ne kaha ki nayaa kanoon olympic bhaavana ke khilaaf he
 He said that the BJP was demanding that the bill be sent to the Select Committee, which the government did not accept
 vahiin mukhyamantri virbhadra singh kaa kahana he ki ab tak khel sanghon par ek hi parivaar kaa kabza rahaa he, nae kanoon se ekadhikaar khatm hoga or karypranali paardarshee ho paaegi
 But HPCA President Anurag Thakur has termed the Sports Bill as anti-sports and called it a black law
 unhone kaha ki bisisiai pehle hi saafe kar chuke he ki agar koi pradesh agar aisa kanoon paas karata he to us kanoon ke tahat koi khel sangh banataa he to use manyata nahin di jaaegi
 The special thing is that the Congress has also tried to remove Anurag Thakur from the HPCA in 2005

 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad jin rajyon main bhi vidhansabha chunaav hue hai, unamem zyaadaatar rajyon main satta virdohi lahar dekhne ko mili he
 Siddaramaiah's defeat in the Karnataka Assembly elections is also a result of this trend
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle jin rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai, vahaan bhi aisi satta virdohi lahar dekhne ko mil sakati he
 Let us tell you that in the last Lok Sabha elections, there was a strong anti-incumbency against the UPA government led by Manmohan Singh
 2ji spectrum, koyala block aavanton or rashtramandal khel sahit kai ghotaalon ke chalate logon ne manmohan singh ke khilaaf vot kiya or narendra modi ke netritv main bijepi ko spasht bahumat dekar desh kii satta saunpi thi
 The first assembly election after the Lok Sabha elections was held in Delhi
 rajya kii 70 vidhansabha siton main se aam aadmi party ko 67 siten mili
 Delhi's mandate went against both BJP and Congress
 congress dilli chunaav main khaataa bhi nahin khol saki
 In the states against which the mandate went against the ruling party, the Congress was in power in most of the states
 aise main grand old party ko satta virdohi lahar kaa samaanaa karnaa padaa he
 Due to this, the Congress has lost its power in many states
 vahiin bijepi ko bhi aisi ashanka kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 Assembly elections have been held in Maharashtra, Haryana, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh
 in sabhi rajyon main congress kii sarkarein thim or use satta virdohi lahar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The same happened in the Karnataka elections
 ek ke baad ek rajya kii satta congress ke haathon se khisakati gai
 In Andhra Pradesh, TDP gained power by defeating Congress and YSR Congress
 baaki anya sabhi rajyon main bijepi vijeta banakar ai
 The BJP has no real base in Andhra Pradesh, until two months ago she was with the TDP, but now both have different paths
 odisha main naveen patnayak ke netritv vaali bijedy or pashchim bengal main mamata banerjee trinmul ne is pravriti ko kam kar diya
 However, this is an exception
 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main nitish kumaar, lalu kii party argedy ke saath gathjod karke bihar main apni satta ko bachaae rakhane main kaamyaab rahe
 If this is the trend, then the BJP will have to face the anti-incumbency in Rajasthan
 gujarat main bijepi ko 22 saalon tak satta main rahane kii vajah se asantosh kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 Although the BJP was successful in defending its power, for the first time the BJP came down to 100 and got just seven seats more than the majority
 madhyapradesh or chhattisgarh main bijepico bhi kathin chunauti kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he, donon rajyon main congress saamne hogi
 There will be a direct contest between the two parties in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
 isi tarah se jharkhand main congress-jeemem gathbandhan agle vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi ke liye mushkilen khadi kar saktaa he
 Although BJP is the strongest party at the national level and Narendra Modi is considered the most popular leader
 aise main satta virdohi lahar kii pravriti jari, to 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sattarudh dal ke liye jeet aasaan nahin hogi
 Provided that the opposition came into the fray jointly
 itnaa hi nahin agar vipakshi partiyaan aapasi matbhed dur karke vyaavhaarik ravaiya apanaatin hai, to phir sattadhari bijepi ke liye mushkil paidaa ho sakati he
 The opposition hopes that the BJP is in power in 20 states and in 2019 there will be an anti-incumbency wave in many states, which can help the opposition in the Lok Sabha elections

 nimonia ke kaaran varsh 2018 main paanch varsh se kam umr ke bacchon kii maut ke maamle main bharat duusare sthaan par he
 The disease is now benign and it is possible to prevent it, despite its global death, one child dies every 39 seconds
 sanyukt raashtra kii ek nai report main yah baat saamne ai he
 The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said that over 800,000 children under the age of five died of pneumonia globally last year, or say one child died every 39 seconds
 nimonia ke kaaran jin bacchon kii maut hui unamem se adhiktar kii umr do varsh se kam thi or 1,53,000 bacchon kii maut janm ke pehle maheene main hi ho gai
 Most children died in Nigeria due to pneumonia
 yahaan yah aankada 1,62,000 rahaa
 It is followed by India with a figure of 1,27,000, Pakistan with a figure of 58,000, Congo with a figure of 40,000, and Ethiopia with a figure of 32,000
 sanra kii agency ne kaha ki paanch varsh ke kam umr ke bacchon main maut ke kul maamalon main 15 fisadi kii vajah nimonia he
 Despite this, only three percent of the global infectious disease research expenditure is spent on this disease
 nimonia ke kaaran hone vaali maut or garibi ke bich bhi majboot sambandh he
 Access to drinking water, lack of adequate health care and lack of nutrition and indoor air pollution increases the risk of the disease
 nimonia ke kaaran hone vaali kul maut main se aadhi kii vajah vaayu pradooshan he
 It is almost forgotten that pneumonia is also an epidemic

 In this, the then telecom minister a Raja has been blamed for all the disturbances
 ye jaankariyaan us draft report se nikali hai, jo ki congress netaa pisi chaako kii adhyakshata vaali jepisi kii taraf se apane sadasyon ko banti gai he
 Politics is hot on this
 bijepi or left ne iske khilaaf asahmati prastaav laane kaa faisla kiya he
 Actually, the BJP is angry at the Prime Minister being given a clean chit
 bijepi netaa or samiti ke sadsy yashavanth sinha ne cameti ke adhyaksh pisi chaako par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki piem or chidambaram ko bachaane ke liye chaako ne naitikta taak par rakh di
 On the other hand, the Left has questioned why PM and Raja were not invited to JPC
 sipiai netaa gurudas das gupta ne kaha ki yah report lipapoti he or ab is par cameti ke adhyaksh pisi chaako ko kai sawaalon kaa jawaab dena hoga
 Both the BJP and the Left are preparing to raise the issue vigorously in Parliament
 dasgupta ne kaha, ham ise khaarij karenge
 We will give our views
 yah maamle par pardaa daalane kii koshish he
 This is a story made at the behest of the Congress party
 jepisi ke sadsy dasgupta ne kaha ki yah saamne aae tathyon ke virodhabhasi he 
 BJP spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi said, since we were part of the JPC, we will keep our views so that it comes on record for the future
 isse itihaas kaayam hoga, kyonki report bhavi peedi ke liye hoti he
 Lekhi, while demanding the JPC, justified the party's stance by saying, as a party that believes in the system of administration, we cannot ignore the systems that have been established
 bhaajapa pravaktaa ne kaha, hamane sochaa tha ki ve desh ke liye kaam karne vaale log honge, ek raajnneetik dal ke sadsy kii tarah na dekhakar ek rajaneta kii tarah kii drushti rakhenge
 But this has not happened
 bhakpa netaa di raja ne kaha, yah ek congress report banakar rah gai he
 My party will give a dissent letter because we do not agree with it
 raja ne report ke li hone kii bhi yah kehete hue aalochana kii, yah hamen bilkul sweekaarya nahin he
 It is still a draft report
 jepisi kii aupchaarik baithak ab bhi honi he
 The report is yet to be formally accepted
 bhakpa netaa ne yah bhi kaha ki yah ‘‘pradhanmantri or tatkaaleen vitt mantri ko bachaane’’ kaa spasht prayaas he
 On the other hand, the DMK again raised its demand to allow A
 Raja to present his case before the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) in the 2G case, saying that the report of the committee in the event of Raja not being allowed to clarify on these allegations
 Will remain 'useless'
 dramuk ne kaha ki unke netaa ke khilaaf ‘‘galat aarope’’ lagaaye gaye hai
 Party MP TKS Elengovan said that without calling Raja, these were false allegations, which made no sense
 tippaniyan By the way, the government will have to make a lot of effort to get this report passed in the House
 jepisi main adhyaksh ko milakar 30 sadsy hote hai, jisamen 20 loksabhaa or 10 rajyasabha ke sadsy hote hai
 If the government gets the support of the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party on the report, then the committee will have 14 members against the government while there will be 16 members against the government
 sadan main report ko manjuur karaane ke liye sarkaar ko kuch or sadasyon kii jarurat hogi, jiske liye centre sarkaar ko trinmul congress yaa phir janata dal united jaisi partiyon ko manaanaa hoga
 If members of any of these parties are absent, then the government's work will be done, that is, the managers of the government will have to manage their figures cleverly in this number game
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki jepisi report kaa bhi vahi haal hoga, jo piesi report kaa hua tha
 The BJP and the Left have decided to bring a dissent motion against it
 darasal, bijepi pradhanmantri ko clin chit die jane se naaraaz he

 duusari taraf left ne sawaal uthaaya he ki piem or raja ko jepisi main kyon nahin bulaayaa gaya
 CPI leader Gurudas Das Gupta said that the report was a surprise and now the committee chairman PC Chacko will have to answer many questions on it
 bijepi or left donon is mudde ko sansad main jorshor se uthaane kii taiyaari main hai
 Dasgupta said, we will dismiss it
 ham apane vichaar denge
 This is an attempt to cover the matter
 yah congress party ke ishaare par gadhi gai kahani he
 JPC member Dasgupta said that this is contradictory to the facts revealed
 bhaajapa pravaktaa minakshi lekhi ne kaha, chunki ham jepisi kaa hissaa the, ham apane vichaar rakhenge taaki yah bhavishya ke liye on record aa jaae
 This will preserve history, as the report is for future generations
 lekhi ne jepisi kii maang karte samay party ke rukh ko yah kehete hue sahi tehraaya, prashasan kii vyavastha main yakeen rakhane vaali ek party ke taur par ham un pranaaliyon kii andekhi nahin kar sakate jinhen sthapit kiya gaya he
 The BJP spokesperson said, "we thought that they would be people working for the country, not looking like a member of a political party and keeping a vision like a politician
" lekin aisa nahin hua he
 CPI leader d Raja said, it has remained as a Congress report
 meri party ek asantosh patr degi, kyonki ham isse sahamat nahin hai
 Raja also criticized the leaking of the report, saying it is not acceptable to us at all
 yah ab bhi ek masauda report he
 jpc's formal meeting is still to be held
 report ko aupchaarik taur par sweekaar kiya janaa baaki he
 The CPI leader also said that this was a clear attempt to "save the Prime Minister and the then Finance Minister"

 The DMK said that "wrong allegations" have been leveled against their leader
 party ke saansad tii ke es ellengoan ne kaha ki raja ko bulaaye bina yah galat aarope hai, jinka koi matlab nahin he
 The comments vaise, is report ko sadan main paas karwaane ke liye bhi sarkaar ko bahut mashkkat kerani hogi
 The JPC consists of 30 members including the Speaker, of which 20 are members of the Lok Sabha and 10 of the Rajya Sabha
 agar sarkaar ko report par samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party kaa samarthan miltaa he to sarkaar ke saath cameti ke 14 sadsy honge jabaki sarkaar ke khilaaf 16 sadsy honge
 The government will need some more members to get the report approved in the House, for which the central government will have to convince parties like Trinamool Congress or Janata Dal United
 agar inamen se kisi party ke sadsy gaiyr-maujuud rahe to sarkaar kaa kaam ho jayega yani sarkaar ke managers ko is number game main apane aankadon ko chaturaai se manage karnaa hoga
 Experts believe that the JPC report will have the same condition as the PAC report

 dasgupta ne kaha, ham ise khaarij karenge
 We will give our views

 This is a story made at the behest of the Congress party
 jepisi ke sadsy dasgupta ne kaha ki yah saamne aae tathyon ke virodhabhasi he 
 BJP spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi said, since we were part of the JPC, we will keep our views so that it comes on record for the future
 isse itihaas kaayam hoga, kyonki report bhavi peedi ke liye hoti he
 Lekhi, while demanding the JPC, justified the party's stance by saying, as a party that believes in the system of administration, we cannot ignore the systems that have been established
 bhaajapa pravaktaa ne kaha, hamane sochaa tha ki ve desh ke liye kaam karne vaale log honge, ek raajnneetik dal ke sadsy kii tarah na dekhakar ek rajaneta kii tarah kii drushti rakhenge
 But this has not happened

 My party will give a dissent letter because we do not agree with it
 raja ne report ke li hone kii bhi yah kehete hue aalochana kii, yah hamen bilkul sweekaarya nahin he
 It is still a draft report
 jepisi kii aupchaarik baithak ab bhi honi he
 The report is yet to be formally accepted
 bhakpa netaa ne yah bhi kaha ki yah ‘‘pradhanmantri or tatkaaleen vitt mantri ko bachaane’’ kaa spasht prayaas he
 On the other hand, the DMK again raised its demand to allow A
 Raja to present his case before the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) in the 2G case, saying that the report of the committee in the event of Raja not being allowed to clarify on these allegations
 Will remain 'useless'
 dramuk ne kaha ki unke netaa ke khilaaf ‘‘galat aarope’’ lagaaye gaye hai
 Party MP TKS Elengovan said that without calling Raja, these were false allegations, which made no sense
 tippaniyan By the way, the government will have to make a lot of effort to get this report passed in the House
 jepisi main adhyaksh ko milakar 30 sadsy hote hai, jisamen 20 loksabhaa or 10 rajyasabha ke sadsy hote hai
 If the government gets the support of the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party on the report, then the committee will have 14 members against the government while there will be 16 members against the government
 sadan main report ko manjuur karaane ke liye sarkaar ko kuch or sadasyon kii jarurat hogi, jiske liye centre sarkaar ko trinmul congress yaa phir janata dal united jaisi partiyon ko manaanaa hoga
 If members of any of these parties are absent, then the government's work will be done, that is, the managers of the government will have to manage their figures cleverly in this number game

 47 cr [thu+fri+sat]— taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh)july 9, 2016 Angry at not getting Lok Sabha ticket from Pataliputra, Ramkripal Yadav, close to Lalu Yadav, will now join BJP
 bijepi ke sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki ramkripal mangalvaar ko party jwoin kar lenge
 Amidst all this, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav has made it clear that he has not asked Ramkripal to leave the party
 par ve janaa chaahate hai to unhen nahin roka jayega
 Lalu Yadav said, 'I never asked Ramkripal to leave the party
 magar koi party chhodkar jane ko utaaru he to use roka nahin ja saktaa
 The candidates whose names were announced will not be changed
 ' gauratlab he ki ramkripal yadav ne 8 march ko argedy ke sabhi padon se istipha de diya tha
 Although he did not leave the party
 jiske baad argedy ne unki rajyasabha sadsyta ko radd karne kii sifarish na karne kii baat kahi thi
 What is the whole story: Laloo Yadav announced the party's Lok Sabha candidates on 6 March
 is suchi main unki patni rabari devi or beti misa bharti kaa naam tha par ramkripal yadav kaa naam nadaarad tha
 Misa was given a ticket from Pataliputra seat, where Ramkripal himself wanted to contest
 ve naaraaz ho gaye or bagawati tevar apana liye
 The next day, Misa Bharti herself arrived to convince 'uncle' Ramkripal
 unhone kaha ki ve party ke varisht netaa ke liye patliputra seat chhodane ko taiyaar hai
 Then by evening news came that Ramkripal Yadav had agreed
 laga ki maamla sulajh gaya par twist tab aayaa ki jab lalu yadav ne ye bayaan de diya ki bich res main ghode nahin badale jate
 After this, on March 8, Ramkripal Yadav announced his resignation from all party posts
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki argedy or misa bharti ne unke saath imotional atyaachaar kiya
 Misa's arrival at his home was merely a political gimmick
 jis par misa bharti ne palatwaar karte hue ki agar koi bhatiji apane chachaa ko manaane jaae, vah bhi imotional atyaachaar he, to main kya kahuun? Salman Khan's film 'bajrangi Bhaijaan', breaking records one after the other, has now reached number two among Bollywood's highest-grossing films of all time
 'bhaijan' ne duusare number par pahunchane ke liye 'mistar parfectionist' or apane dost aamir khan kii 'dhooma-3' ko pahada he
 Now there is only one film left which has earned more than 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' and that too is Aamir Khan's film 'PK'
 bollywood or khaskar box offis kii nabj pahchaanane vaale taran adarsh ne 'bajrangi bhaijan' ke liye 'anstopable' shabd kaa istemaal karte hue twit kiya he ki film kii jeet kaa safar jari he
 Along with this, he has also told the film's earnings in the third week

 suraksha balon ke badhate dabaav ke chalate bagdadi ne 2 april, 2017 ko mosul chhod diya tha or vah syrian simavarti ilaakon kii taraf aa gaya tha
 The media office of DESI indicated that it may take some time to get the exact details of the operation details and to confirm this information
 media karyaalay ne bataaya ki maamla khufia ikaayiyon kii ekta se judaa hua he
 As a result, information was received on the use of the hair airport and chemicals in Khan Shaykhun, but no Syrian team has participated in it
 yah maamla america, rus or sanyukt raashtra ke pratinidhi tak hi simit he
 According to DESI news, Russian President Vladimir Putin may discuss a political deal about ISIS chief al-baghdadi, which could undermine America's credibility
 isse antarrashtriya manchon par rus apane daavon ke saath vishwasaneeyata paa saktaa he, praasangik ho saktaa he
 DESI expressed great satisfaction over al-baghdadi's arrest after contacting the head of the department, Luciano Consterty, and the Executive Council

 lekin mulaayam santusht nahin hai, kamare ke duusari taraf baithe netaaon ko ishaara kiya gaya to ek-ek karke sabhi mulaayam ko dange kaa feedback dene lagate hai
 Most leaders express their displeasure with the attitude of the officials
 netaaon kii raay par mulaayam singh bhi sahmati jataate hai
 They order Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav to identify the guilty officers and take strict action against them

 Mulayam Singh Yadav, in the presence of the Chief Minister during a program organized at sp's state headquarters on Vikramaditya Marg on June 4, three months ago, said about the law and order situation in the state, "if i was the Chief Minister, within 15 days the state Would have made law and order right
 ”mujffarnagar main faile sampradayik dange se nipatane ke liye aakhirkaar mulaayam ko mukhyamantri kii bhoomika main aana hi padaa
 This was the first time since the formation of sp's government last year that Netaji held a meeting with the Chief Minister and top administrative officials at his residence
 prashasnic kaary main mulaayam kii dakhlandaji ne yah saaf kar diya ki unhone jin ummiido ke saath apane bete akhilesh ko desh ke sabase bade rajya ke takht par bithaaya tha, ve kuch dhoomil hui hai
 Initially it was being said that Akhilesh was still new and should be given a chance but the constantly deteriorating law and order and one after another riots have raised questions over Akhilesh Yadav's administrative ability as Chief Minister
 sapa ke bheetar akhilesh virdohi swardilli se purvottar disha main rashtriya rajmarg 58, uttar pradesh main mujffarnagar ko do bhugolic or vidambnaapurna ardhanshon main vibhajit karata he—bain taraf muslim or dayee taraf hindu bastiyaan hai

 Amidst this situation, Muslim leaders of the party voiced their anguish in front of Mulayam Singh on the first day of sp's two-day national executive, which started on September 11 in Agra, about 350 km from Muzaffarnagar
 netaaon ne guhaar lagaai, ''aap hamen laptaap tablet bhale hi na den lekin hamaari jaano-maal kii hifaazat kar den

 For this reason, they have not been able to get hold of the administrative machinery
 sivaach bataate hai, ''sapa sarkaar ke sheersh par mulaayam singh ke kareebi prashasnic adhikari kabiz hai
 The responsibility of these officers is with Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav but these officials still hold their accountability towards Mulayam Singh
 yahi vajah he ki akhilesh in adhikariyon ke bich apana ikbaal nahin kaayam kar paae hai
 "because of this, officers do not show any kind of activism on any issue, as is expected of them in front of a chief minister
 mujffarnagar main hue dange par kaabo na paae jane kaa ek bada kaaran adhikariyon ke sust or gairjimmedaarana ravaiya he
 The administration's short-sighted move: After killing three people at Kawal in Janasath in Muzaffarnagar on August 27, the government took a short-sighted step and immediately removed DM Surendra Singh and SSP Manzil Saini, but the new DM Kaushalraj Sharma and SSP Subhash Chandra Dubey suddenly took the whole case
 Could not understand it properly
 7 sitambar ko nangla mandaud ilaake main panchayat kii ghoshnaa se paidaa halaat ko kaabo karne ke liye police mahanideshak (dijipi) devraj nagar ek din pehle mujffarnagar pahunch gaye
 On the same day, Nagar, in a meeting with the officials and the enlightened people of the area, admitted that communal tension was spreading in the villages
 police ne nangla mandaud kii panchayat ko sanbhaalane main hi puri takat jhonk di lekin dijipi ne ashanka jataane ke baavjood dehaton main sulag rahi sampradayik tanaav kii chinagaari ko sholaa banane se rokane kaa koi bhi pukhta intjaam nahin kiya
 Not only this, the Intelligence Department also completely failed to fathom the violence that took place after the Panchayat
 mujffarnagar jila nyaayalay main vakil chandrabhan singh kehete hai ki dijipi ke kehane ke baad bhi sthaneey intelligence panchayat ke virodh main gaanvon main sulag rahi chinagaari ko bhaanp paane main asafal rahaa
 Singh says, "all the attention of the police was on the site of the panchayat
" ”panchayat se laut rahe logon par jab hamale hone lage to gaanvon main pulicekarmi the hi nahin
 In fact, despite the presence of all the top officials of the police department, no plan was made to stop the riots in the villages
 jaise hi gaanvon main hinsa faili vah dawanal kii tarah failati gai or police mahaj tamashbin kii bhoomika main rahi
 Additional Director General of Police (law and Order) Arun Kumar admits that there was some omission from the new administrative officers which worsened the situation
 afvaahon ne khaas taur par gaanvon main sampradayik tanaav ko hinsa main badal daalaa
 An IG level officer at the police headquarters says that a sudden riot erupted after the September 7 panchayat due to intelligence and local administration failure
 yah chinagaari shamali tak pahunch gai to 24 ghante ke bheetar sarkaar ke paas sena bulaane ke alaava koi chaara nahin rah gaya tha
 Even after summoning Maya officers, the riots in Muzaffarnagar, Shamli and Barot were not extinguished, Chief Minister Akhilesh placed bets on officers who did not allow riots anywhere in the state during Mayawati's tenure
 unhone 2008 main gajiabad main sampradayik tanaav ko samay rahete niyantrit karne vaale pichhali mayawati sarkaar ke khaas ipies afasar vijay bhushan ko mujffarnagar bhejkar dangagrast ilaake main unke anubhav ko aajamaane kaa nirnay liya

 pichhali sarkaar main estf ke diiji rahe rajeev sabbarwal ko dangaiyon se nipatane main technology kaa upyog karne kaa export mana jaataa he
 He was also included in the team of officers who controlled communal riots in Muzaffarnagar and adjoining districts
 Another special officer of Mayawati, Chandraprakash was the IG of Meerut during the BSP government
 unke kaarykaal ke dauraan meerut main ek bhi sampradayik tanaav nahin hua
 It was also decided to take advantage of Chandraprakash's experience in riot control

 Each of these riots has been instigated by some minor thing
 yah dukhad ghatana khandaani ladaai yaa muhalle ke bich ladaai kaa rup le sakati thi
 But the leaders on both sides sought the opportunity to strengthen their base through the politics of hate and at their behest the incident took the form of communal riots
 mujffarnagar main hui hinsa ne pashchimi jilon main jat-muslim gathjod ko puri tarah se jhakzor kar rakh diya he
 The special thing is that the Jats and Muslim settlements in the rural areas of these districts have been so interlinked that it was not possible for any political party to draw the line of division between the two
 isi ne upi ke pashchimi jilon main jat-muslim kaa ek jitau sameekaran taiyaar kiya
 This alliance provided political manure water to the founder and former Prime Minister of Lok Dal (RLD) Chaudhary Charan Singh

 This is the first time that Jats and Muslims stand face-to-face after the Muzaffarnagar riots
 jaaton or muslimon ke bich shuru hue bantwaare ne sabase zyada in ilaakon main pakad rakhane vaale areldi ke saamne sankat khadaa kar diya he
 This split has opened the doors for political possibility of polarization between Jats and Muslims, in which BJP is visible at the moment in maximum benefit

 There are such things in them which can make your heart sick
 siesai yani centre for science and enwyrnment ye sansanikhej khulaasa kiya he
 According to CSE, the studies conducted on junk food such as chips, burgers, potato bhujia and French fries, were extremely shocking revelations
 khulaasa ye ki bazaar main maujuud sari companiyon ke junk food main trans fat kii maatra zarurat se zyada he
 Not only this, in addition to trans fat, the quantity of sugar and salt in junk food is also more than necessary
 siesai kaa daawa he ki junk food ko lekar sari companiyaan galat jaankaree de rahi hai
 Companies write zero transat on their wrappers, while trans fat is present
 siesai ke daawey ke mutabik agar vaaki junk food main maujuud trans fat kii maatra zarurat se zyada he to ye hamaare or aapke liye acchhee khabar nahin he kyonki trans fat hamaari sehat ke liye behad khatarnaak he
 According to CSE, the claims of almost all food companies making junkfood were found to be false
 companiyaan kahati kuch or hai or khaadya padaarthon main mila kuch or hota he
 The claims of zero transfeat are completely false
 duusari taraf junk food ko lekar niyam sakht hone kii jagah behad deele hai
 According to the study of CSE, all the well-known companies in the market have high amount of trans fat and salt in the junk food
 lihaaja ye kai tarah kii bimariyon ko dastak de rahi hai
 It is important to be careful with junk food, because if the claims of CSE are true, then there is such a thing that is making us sick slowly and also disease that can be directly put to death
 siesai ke daawey ke mutabik bazaar main maujuud sari nami giraami companiyon main maujuud he zarurat se zyada trans fat
 a special type of fat is trans fat which is not found naturally, but is made artificially
 vegetable oil main hydrogen milakar jab thos kiya jaataa he to wo trans fat ban jaataa he
 Making trans fat would be cheaper, so companies use it indiscriminately
 saath hi iske istemaal se utpaada ko khaas swaad diya ja saktaa he
 Trans fat increases cholesterol in our body due to which there is an increased risk of coronary heart disease
 itnaa hi nahin trans fat ke zyada istemaal se hiptension jaisi bimaariyaan bhi hoti he
 Trans fat also affects our liver and slowly makes the liver sick
 baat yaheen khatm nahin hoti trans fat napunsak bhi bana saktaa he
 If the claims of CSE are strong and indeed the amount of trans fat in the junk food being sold in the market is more than necessary, then it is a danger for us and you, it is very dangerous for our new generation
