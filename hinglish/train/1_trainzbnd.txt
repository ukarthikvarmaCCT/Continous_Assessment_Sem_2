 The three parties claimed to have paraded 162 legislators at Hotel Hyatt in Mumbai
 haul main 'amhi 162' or 'we Are 162' likhe poster bhi lagaae gaye the
 158 mlas were present in the hotel? When the debate started on social media on the same day, Shiv Sena leader Priyanka Chaturvedi tweeted in this case and claimed that only 158 mlas were present there
 priyanka chaturvedi ne twit kiya tha, 'jo vahaan par ginati main icchhuk hai unke liye ye aankade hai
 
 
 a total of 158 mlas were present at the Hyatt Hotel
 ' apane hi twit main priyanka ne 4 anupasthit vidhayakon kii detail bhi di thi or likhaa tha ki ve log bhi sampark main hai
 BJP had asked- whether there were 145 mlas or not? These claims of congress-shiv Sena were targeted by Bharatiya Janata Party
 bijepi ke ashish shellar ne vipaksh par nishaanaa sadhate hue poocha tha ki wo 162 vidhayakon kaa daawa karte hai lekin vahaan kya 145 vidhayak bhi maujuud the yaa nahin?bahumat pareekshan se pehle congress ne fansaaya pechabahumat pareekshan ke pehle congress ne pech fansaa diya he

 par hai ri kismat
 Where our leaders themselves are engaged in polishing each other like this, how can the fortunes of the country shine? Seeing the pictures of MP spraying the chilli of democracy, we regret our decision on who and how we all got people off the road and made them sit in this temple of democracy
 13 saal pehle sasand kii dahleez tak aatank ja pahunchaa tha tab bhi itnaa dard nahin hua tha
 Because they were strangers
 padosi mulk se aae the
 But these are all their own
 apano ke bich se uth kar yahaan aae hai
 He is our leader
 sarvshereshth netaa
 Because they sit on the highest rungs of democracy
 par inaki harakatein sadak chhap mawaaliyon se jaraa bhi kam nahin
 Peppers are attacking their own people with powder
 mike ko hathiyaar banaakar tut padana chaahate hai
 It is a privilege that he did not take up arms
 shame aati he, lekin kya karen
 Seeing what is happening from Delhi to the states, it is just a thought that there will be such a situation of politics in the hands of politics, never thought
 par ab sochane kii jarurat he
 In the largest temple of democracy, there is noisy, shouting, tearing of bills, scolding, intimidation, but in the entire Lok Sabha, thinking of using pepper spray or using it as a weapon, uprooting the mic, see it for the first time Got to lokapal bill kii copy ko rajyasabha main argedy ke raajnneeti prasad ne fadkar phenk diya tha
 But a lot has changed now
 jis anhoni kii aahat kabhi vidhansabhaon main sunai padati thi, wo loktantr kii sabase badi panchayat kaa kalank ban gai
 There was uproar as soon as the Lok Sabha proceedings started on 13 February
 sadan 11 baje jaise hi baitha, telugana kaa mudda prashnkaal par haaavee ho gaya
 Hence, the house was adjourned till twelve o'clock
 guuruuvaar ko jaise hi grih mantri susheel kumaar scindia ne loksabhaa main alag telugana rajya kaa bill pesh kiya, andhra pradesh se sambandhit tamaam saansad agbabula ho gaye
 Then expelled Congress MP l Rajagopal sprayed pepper spray on the mps
 ab maamla baaji maarane kaa ho gaya, lihaaja telugu desham party ke saansad venugopal bhi todphod main shaamil ho gaye
 Venugopal was accused that he had brought a knife, but Venugopal denied it
 hangaamaa itnaa badha ki usee dauraan ek sadsy ne spikar mira kumaar ke asana par rakhe kaagajon ko chhinana shuru kar diya
 The house was adjourned till two o'clock in view of the commotion and chaos
 saath hi sadan bhi khaali kara diya gaya
 The house re-sat at two o'clock
 lekin do ghante pehle kii tanatani maahaul main ghuli hui thi
 At the same time, the health of MP Narayan Rao deteriorated, after which he was taken to the hospital, but the big question among them is that how will Parliament be treated for the disease of chaos? Pepper spray was done by mps but an honorable MP , But its democracy is felt in the eyes of India
 pataa nahin tidipi saansad venugopal ne chaaku nikaala yaa nahin lekin sansad ke seene main durvyavhaar kaa chaaku chubh gaya he
 The division of a separate state would create such a huge rift in Parliament, who thought this
 magar ye ho gaya
 Action was taken in this matter immediately
 andhra pradesh ke 17 saansadon ko suspend kar diya gaya
 These mps will remain suspended for as long as the remaining time of the five sittings or sessions of the House

 Taking a dig at Maharashtra's caretaker Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday attacked the BJP leader by resorting to a Hindi poem and described him as a novice in the big game of politics
 mukhyamantri pad saajha karne ke mudde par bhaajapa or shivasena ke bich jabardast takaraav chal rahaa he jisase rajya main sarkaar gathan ko lekar gatirodh paidaa ho gaya he
 Targeting the 49-year-old Fadnavis, Raut tweeted, "those who are rich nobles keep mood soft, are telling your tone, your wealth is new
 ''rajyasabha sadsy raut ne pichley saptaah bhaajapa par nishaanaa saadhane ke liye apane twitor handle par ek hindi kavita post kii thi
 Fadnavis resigned as Chief Minister on Friday and had blamed the ally Shiv Sena for the deadlock in government formation following the recent assembly elections
 istipha dene ke baad fadanvis ne kaha ki bhaajapa ke liye yah hairaan karne vaala he ki shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne nattejey aane ke turant baad hi yah ghoshnaa kar di ki ‘‘sarkaar banane ke liye shivasena ke liye saare vikalp khule hai
 Fadnavis started his political career in the 1990s
 vah varsh 1999 se nagpur-dakshin pashchim vidhansabha kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahe hai or sabase yuva mahayor bhi rahe hai
 The Shiv Sena argued that before the Lok Sabha elections, the two parties had decided that the chief minister's post would be shared for two-and-a-half years
 fadanvis ne kaha ki unki maujuudagi main aisa koi nirnay nahin liya gaya
 Later, Thackeray strongly opposed Fadnavis' claim and said that until the BJP accepts that the Chief Minister's post will be shared between the two allies, there will be no dialogue with him
 thakare ne kaha ki unhone apane pita divangat bal thakare se rajya main shivasena kaa mukhyamantri banane kaa vaada kiya tha jise vah puraa karenge
 In the state assembly elections held on October 21, BJP won 105 seats, Shiv Sena 56, NCP 54 and Congress 44 seats

 aam aadmi party ke do saansadon bhagwant maan or dharmaveer gandhi ke bich telephone baatcheet kaa ek clip li hone ke baad party ne aarope lagaaya ki narendra modi sarkaar uske saansadon kii jasusi kara rahi he
 In this clip, both these leaders have expressed their displeasure with the party leadership
 maan baatcheet ke kram main gandhi se kehete sunai de rahe hai ki unhen unki lokapriyata ke kaaran chunaav main vijay mili aap kii ‘jhaadu’ kii vajah se nahin or jo log unke khilaaf kaam kar rahe the, unhen rajya ikai kaa prabharee bana diya gaya he
 Mann can be heard saying, 'those who worked against us
 jinhone hamaari jeet par afsos kiya, unhen hamaara prabharee bana diya gaya he
 Accepting the conversation, Gandhi said Maan was speaking from his heart
 unhone kaha ki yah baatcheet farvari main aravind kejariwal ke mukhyamantri path kii shapath lene ke ek din pehle hui thi
 Gandhi denied any role in the leaking of the clip, saying, "whatever Mann has said is correct
" unhone apane dil kii baat kii he
 Gandhi was suspended from AAP last month for anti-party activities
 unhone kaha ki mere phone main ricard kii suvidha nahin he
 Mann reacted cautiously, stating that he had no doubt in Kejriwal's leadership and that he was a loyal soldier of AAP
 unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘yah gandi raajnneeti kaa nateeja he or punjab main aap ke udai ko rokane ke liye aisa kiya ja rahaa he
 We are basically saying that if there is factionalism in the Punjab unit of the party then we should inform Delhi
 ’ party ne haalanki centre par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki usne apane saansadon se unke phone tap hone ke bare main loksabhaadhyaksh ko patr likhane ke liye kaha tha
 The party said that the issues raised by Mann in the talks are of no importance
 aap pravaktaa deepak bajpeyi ne kaha ki baatcheet kii saamagree kaa koi mahatv nahin he
 These are minor things
 lekin badi baat yah he ki centre saansadon ke khilaaf kisi chaalen chal rahaa he
 Angry at not taking initiative of Ram temple in Ayodhya, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has now started directly targeting the Modi government at the Center
 aresas ko aisa lagata he ki agar modi sarkaar phir se satta main aa bhi gai to mandir nirmaan ko lekar koi pahal nahin karegi
 In this regard, Sarkaryavah Bhaiyyaji Joshi, considered number two in the RSS, targeted the Modi government at the Center in a gesture and satirized at an event held at the Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj on Thursday that the Ram temple will be built in the year 2025
 bhaiya ji joshi ne kaha ki jab ram mandir kaa nirmaan shuru ho jayega to desh teji se vikaas karne lagegaa
 In this program, he clearly stated that there are still many challenges regarding the construction of Ram temple, which needs to be addressed
 unke mutabik ayodhya main ram mandir sirf ek mandir kaa nirmaan nahin he, balki yah karodon hinduon kii aasthaa or sammaan se bhi judaa hua he
 In the seminar organized by Haridwar's organization Divya Prem Seva Mission at Kumbh Mela, the head of the Sangh, Bhaiyya Joshi, attacked the Modi government not only on the temple but also on the issue of development
 ram mandir banane ke baad hoga vikasbhaiya ji joshi ne kaha ki vikaas ko gati tab milegi, jab saal 2025 main ayodhya main ram mandir kaa nirmaan hoga
 He said that India will move ahead in the same way as after the construction of Somnath Temple in 1952 and Jawaharlal Nehru was the PM
 bhaiya ji joshi ne modi raaj main bharat ke phir se vishwaguru banane kii raah par chalane ke daavon ko bhi nazarandaaj kiya or vyangy karte hue kaha ki bharat takreeban 150 saal baad vishwaguru ban jayega
 After the speech, when Bhaiyaji wanted to talk to Joshi about this, he refused to speak anything on camera
 unhone camere se alag hui baatcheet main itnaa jarur kaha ki mandir par har koi apni marji se bol rahaa he to 2025 main mandir banane kii baat unhone apni ichha se bol di he
 Bhaiyya joshi also regretted dividing Hindu society into castes in this program and emphasized solidarity
 hinduon kii bhaawanaaon kaa dhyaan rakhegauratlab he ki sangh ke kuch netaaon kaa maananaa rahaa he ki agar bijepi ko satta mili he to use mandir nirmaan kii pahal kerani chahie thi
 Because people also chose Modi government because they believed that the government would take care of the feelings of Hindus
 lekin satta main aane ke baad sarkaar kii praathamiktaayen badal gayi
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said in his recent interview that the government will take a decision on the construction of the temple only after the court's decision
 iske baad ram mandir ke paksh main aawaaj uthaane waalon kii tyoriyaan chadhi hui hai
 On the JNU dispute, Congress President Sonia Gandhi launched a major attack on the Central Government on Monday
 unhone modi sarkaar par hosh khone kaa iljaam lagaate hue kaha ki adaalatein akhaada ban rahi hai or desh kaa maahaul bahut bura hone laga he
 He accused the Center of undermining democratic methods
 sonia gandhi ne kaha ki mangalvaar se shuru ho rahe sansad ke bajet satr main samaan vichaardhaara vaale dalon ke saath milakar congress is mudde ko joardaar tareeke se uthaaegi
 Apparently, the Congress President has indicated with this that the budget session of Parliament is going to be uproar like the last two sessions
 har taraf hue modi sarkaar ke hamalecongress kaarysmiti kii baithkko sambodhit karte hue sonia ne kaha ki sattarudh tantra puri tarah santulan kho chukaa he
 He seems intent on weakening all democratic methods
 vah jaanch kii bhaavana, poochtacha kii bhaavana, bahes or asahmati kii bhaavana ko nasht karne par utaaru he
 He said that first he suppressed our voice in the Lok Sabha
 phir civil sosayadi kaaryakartaaon or sanghathanon ko chup kiya
 Now it is the turn of universities

 The 'patriotism is being concocted' The top policy making unit of the Congress said that this is a planned attack on freedom of expression and freedom of differences

 The CWC said that when the Parliament session starts, the Congress will raise these issues and other issues with the cooperation of like-minded parties
 isamen kaha gaya, ‘sansad kaa kartavya charchaa karnaa or kanoon bananaa he

 But less than a month after the visit, Indian diplomats submitted an application to China and 14 other members of the UN Security Council
 darasal, suraksha parishad kii paabandiyon ko darkinar karte hue pakistani aatankwaadi zaki-ur-rahamaan lakhvi ko rawalpindi kii jail se reeha kar diya gaya tha
 For this, he had deposited a huge bond
 bharat kaa anurodh suraksha parishad kii 1267 pratibandh samiti se tha jo al kaayda, taliban or ab ies se sambandh rakhane vaale aatankwaadiyon tathaa samoohon kii suchi banaati he
 The request was to investigate how the sanctions imposed on Lakhvi were violated and also to question Pakistan who paid such an amount for his release
 bharat pakistan main based aatankwaadiyon ko is suchi main laane kii koshishen karata rahaa he taaki unke hathiyaar hasil karne par roak lage, unke aane-jane par pabandi rahe or sabase ahm ki unki vittiya parisampattiyon ko fries kar diya jaae
 These efforts have been hitting the sugar wall even before
 suraksha parishad ke puraane niyamon ke mutabik, uske 15 sadasyon main se koi bhi kisi aavedan main dikkat paae jane par use “takneekee hold” par rakh saktaa he
 This could be done not only without informing the countries outside the Security Council as to which country actually imposed a hurdle in the application but it was not necessary to explain its reason to the imposing country
 lekin yah ateet kii baat thi
 Of course, Indian diplomats would have thought that Xi had received Modi's unprecedented, the conditions would have changed a bit in his glow
 par aisa nahin tha
 The only difference was that China had given a reason for the hurdle in the application - they needed more information
 lihaaja, jab 31 march, 2016 ko beijing ne jaish-e-mohammad ke mukhiya masood ajahar ko soochibaddh karne ke ek anya aavedan ko takneekee hold par daal diya to bhartiya kootneetikon ko koi hairaani nahin hui
 The difference was in response to the Indian camp this time
 teen din ke bheetar videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj, raksha mantri manohar parrikar or rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal&sabhi ne moscow or beijing main baithkon main chini samakakshon ke saamne ajahar ke masale ko uthaaya
 In particular, Doval spoke in front of China's top diplomat Yang Zhechi during the 19th phase of border talks in Beijing on April 20: Beijing needs to stop distinguishing between good terrorists and bad terrorists
 shaayad apni baat ko sabit karne ke liye bharat ne pehali baar uigur netaa dolkun isa ko electronic vija jari kar diya taaki ve 28 april ko dharmashala main chini asantushton tathaa kaaryakartaaon kii apni tarah kii pehali baithak main hissaa le saken
 Dolkun fled the Xinjiang region of China in 2006 to become a German citizen
 beijing kaa kahana he ki vah “aatankwaadi” he jo 1990 main bambaari kii ghatnaon ke liye jimmedaar he
 But Dolkun refutes these allegations
 lekin vija 25 april ko khaarij kar diya gaya or grih mantralay ne isaki vajah ke taur par interpol ke us red corner notice ko bataaya jo china ke kehane par isa ke khilaaf jari kiya gaya tha
 The Indian government was accused of bowing under pressure from China, but officials say they had no other option because they could not ignore the Red Corner notice - so that the rest of the country is also India's most wanted Do not be motivated to take similar response in case of criminals
 adhikari saarvajanik taur par is baat kii pushti karne ke liye to taiyaar nahin hai ki kya isa ko vija beijing ko chetavanee dene ke iraade se jari kiya gaya tha, par kai purv kootnithik is baat ko ek pukhta sanket ke taur par hi dekhte hai ki bharat ne pehali baar china ke asantushton or nirvasiton ko ikattha hone kii ijaajat di he
 a strong partner, India is hopeful that it may force Beijing to rethink its policy, but according to current and former Chinese officials and Beijing's strategic experts, the scope is slim
 pehali baat, sanyukt raashtra main china ke kadamon ke liye sabase bade utprerak pakistan ke saath uske najdiki rishte hai
 After recent problems in relations with North Korea, Chinese strategic experts now call Pakistan the only real ally of their country
 china-pakistan rishte shi ke shashan main or gahare hue hai
 He has started a $ 46 billion economic corridor from Xinjiang to Pakistan via Pakistan-occupied Kashmir
 beijing main dharna he ki pashchimi jhinjiyang kshetra main china ko jis badhate islamic khatre kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he, usase nibatane kii yojana ke centre main pakistan ko rakhaa janaa chahie
 According to Han Hua, an expert in the South Asia region at Peking University, cooperation between the two countries is working well
 ab tak china kaa najariya do-aiami rahaa haih alpavadhi main vah paak-afgaan seemaa par uigur aatankwaadi campon par prahaar karne ke liye paak sena or iesai kii madad letaa rahaa he or dirghakaal main uski yojana dasiyon arab dollar laga aarthik coridor banane kii he
 It hopes that it will open Xinjiang region and provide employment to Uygur youth
 pakistan ne jahaan bharat ko nishane par lene vaale aatankwaadi guton se nibatane main paanv peeche khinche hai, china ko yakeen he ki uski sena ne tej or prabhavi kadam uthaakar china-virdohi guton ko kuchlaa he or pratibandhit purv turk menistan islamic movement ke shiviron ko nest-naabud kiya he
 Chinese Ambassador Zhang Chunshiang, who was appointed to Pakistan immediately after the September 11, 2001 attacks, reflects Beijing's belief
 ve donon deshon ko “louh bhai” bataate hai or unamem kisi tarah kii matbhed kii shankaa jaahir karne par uttejit ho jate hai
 Zhang says, "pakistan is the only country with which we have a strong relationship
" ”pichley saal ke ant main beijing main media se ek baatcheet main jab unase uigur guton or pakistani sanghathanon main aatanki rishton ke bare main poocha gaya or sawaal kiya gaya ki kya pakistani agenciyaan aatankwaadi guton par kaabo paane ke liye paryaapt kadam uthaa rahi hai? to ve naaraaz ho uthe, “kya america ne aatankwaad khatm kar diya he? or bharat ne? yah naammumkin he
 Then why do you only question about Pakistan? " Echoing the recent statements of Pakistani military chief Raheel Sharif on Indian intelligence agencies trying to impede Chinese investment in Pakistan, Zhang alleged that during his tenure, Pakistani terrorists attacked the Gwadar port being built with the help of China
 But a "foreign power" did not name them, but "everyone knows" about it
 ”mere aatankwaadi banaam tumharachin ke liye sahyog kaa matlab apane saathi ko antarrashtriya aalochana se bachaana bhi he
 By 2008, Beijing had blocked at least three attempts by India to include jamaat-ud-dawa in the terrorist list
 mumbai hamalon ke parinamswaroop duniyabar main jo gussa failaa, usee ke baad jaakar usne apana faisla badla tha
 That same year, Beijing also stopped Washington's attempt to list four ISI officers
 chini videsh mantralay kii pravaktaa hua chunaying kaa jor is baat par he ki ajahar par liya gaya takneekee hold “tathyon” or suraksha parishad kii pratibandh samiti ke “niyamon tathaa prakriyaaon” ke anuroop he
 These rules and procedures, he indicated, "encourage dialogue between the two countries that request to be included in the list, and where those people or groups reside within the list
" 
 ”duusare shabdon main kaha jaae to china kaa sandesh yah he ki vah bharat se yah apeksha karata he ki vah pakistan ke saath apane masalon ko suraksha parishad main laane kii bajaae dwipaksheeya tareeke se sulajhaaye
 According to a former senior Chinese diplomat, the sanctions of the Security Council have been ineffective in taking stern measures against any group at the grassroots level and in Beijing's view these are only political maneuvers
 china kii divarbhartiya adhikariyon ke anusaar is daleel main koi dam nahin he
 They point to examples from the past where international sanctions have put pressure on many hard-core countries to act
 unka kahana tha ki sampattiyon ko fries kar dene se aatankwaadi guton kii harkaton or unki kshamtaaon par bhi roak lagati he
 Nevertheless, as far as Pakistani organizations are concerned, the fact that their inclusion in the list has not affected their jihadist intentions
 suchi main shaamil hone ke baad bhi lashkar or jaish kii gatividhiyaan bagaiyr dikkat ke chalati rahi hai
 India is engaging Pakistan in bilateral dialogue to attack terrorism, but the Security Council shows a useful way to raise international pressure
 islamabad or beijing main kaam kar chuke or france tathaa germany main purv bhartiya rajdoot tii

 Rangachari says, "this does not mean that it will inevitably happen, but the hope for India is that the pressure of international public opinion will force Pakistan to come into action and therefore we will have to try it
" ”ve kehete hai ki bharat ko dohari ranneeti apnaani hogi
 He has to constantly communicate with China and persuade it
 saath hi apni baat ko upar rakh unhen is baat kaa ehsaas karana hoga ki agar baaki deshon ne bhi yahi khel khelnaa shuru kar diya ki koun aatankwaadi he or koun nahin, or har koi sirf apane hiton ke anuroop kaam karne laga to aatankwaad se milakar ladgaye kii puri duniya kii koshish naakaam ho jaaegi
 According to some diplomats, the most important thing for India is to try to push the reforms stuck to change the old rules of the Security Council that allow countries to hide behind anonymous veto and arbitrary technical hold
 
 sanyukt raashtra main sthaayee bhartiya pratinidhi saiyad akbaruddin ne 15 april ko yahi daleel di
 He said in an open debate by the Security Council, "the unanimous sanctions and secrecy of the sanctions committee on al Qaeda, the Taliban and ISIS should be reconsidered
 ” par adhikariyon kaa maananaa he ki jab tak yah nahin hota, ajahar sareekhe kai aatankwaadi chini diwaar ke paar ham sabaki pahunch se pare bane rahenge

 kai baar phone pani main gir jane kii vajah se kharaab ho jaataa he
 In such a situation, many people adopt unique methods to dry the phone
 jaise oven main phone ko rakh kar sukhaana or heater ke upar rakhana aadi
 But all these methods can damage your phone
 agar aapkaa bhi mobile barish main bhig gaya he yaa phir pani main gir gaya he to ghabaraane kii zarurat nahin he
 Here we tell you 5 easy ways to save a mobile phone soaked in water
 1
 If the mobile phone is soaked in rain or has fallen in water, immediately remove the battery and switch off the mobile
 phone ko of karne ke baad sim card, memory card jaisi sabhi accessories ko alag kar den
 Separating all these accessories will reduce the risk of short circuits
 2
 After separating the accessories of the phone, it is necessary to dry all the ports of the phone
 iske liye tishyu paper kaa istemaal karen
 In addition, soft towels can also be used to wipe the phone
 3
 Place the soaked phone in a bowl filled with dried rice
 phir is boul kosuraj kii roshnimen yaa kisi garm jagah par kam se kam do dinon ke liye chhod den
 The longer you keep the bowl in a warm place, the higher the expectation that your mobile will work again
 4
 If you do not want to keep the phone in the rice vessel, you can also use silica gel packs
 ye jail packs juuton ke dabbon main rakhe jate hai
 They have the ability to absorb moisture faster than rice
 5
 Dry the mobile phone with a vacuum cleaner for 20-30 minutes as it drains the water thoroughly from the internal parts
 dhyaan rahe ki phone ko on karne main jaldi na karen
 Avoid doing this: Wet mobile phones should never be dried with a hairdryer
 dryer bahut zyada garm hawa phenkata he aise main phone ke circuits pigal sakate hai
 Apart from this, instead of drying the water entering the phone, it transfers it to the internal parts, which can damage the mobile phone

 1659 main adilshaah ne apane senapati ko shivaji ko maarane ke liye bheja
 There was a war between the two at Pratapgad Fort
 is yuddh main ve vijayi hue
 Seeing the growing power of Shivaji, the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb sent Jai Singh and Dilip Khan to stop Shivaji
 unhone ek samjhaute par shivaji se hastakshar karne ko kaha
 According to the agreement, they have to give 24 fortresses to the Mughal ruler
 tippaniyan After the agreement, Shivaji went to the court of Agra to meet Aurangzeb
 vah 9 may, 1666 i ko apane putr shambhaji evam 4000 maratha sainikon ke saath mogul darbar main upasthit hue, parantu aurangzeb dwaara uchit sammaan na praapt karne par shivaji ne bhare hue darbar main aurangzeb ko vishwasghaatee kaha
 With this Aurangzeb imprisoned him and his son in 'jaipur Bhavan'
 shivaji 13 agast, 1666 i ko falon kii tokari main chhipakar faraar ho gaye or ko raigarh pahunche
 By 1674, Shivaji had captured all the territories which had to be given to the Mughals under the Treaty of Purandar
 unhone marathaon kii ek vishaal sena taiyaar kar lee thi
 During his reign, the use of guerrilla warfare also started
 unhone nausena bhi taiyaar kii thi
 He is considered the father of the Indian Navy
 april 1680 ko biimaar hone par unki mrityu ho gai thi
 In 1659, Adilshah sent his commander to kill Shivaji
 donon ke bich pratapgarh kile par yuddh hua
 He was victorious in this war
 shivaji kii badhati takat ko dekhte hue mughal samraat aurangzeb ne jai singh or dilip khan ko shivaji ko rokane ke liye bheja
 He asked Shivaji to sign an agreement
 samjhaute ke mutabik unhen mughal shaasha ko 24 kile dene honge
 The comments samjhaute ke baad shivaji agra ke darbar main aurangzeb se milane ke liye gaye
 He appeared in the Mughal court on May 9, 1666 AD, with his son Shambhaji and 4000 Maratha soldiers, but Shivaji called Aurangzeb unfaithful in the filled court after Aurangzeb did not receive due respect
 isse aurangzeb ne unhen evam unke putr ko 'jaipur bhawan' main qaid kar diya
 Shivaji escaped hiding on August 13, 1666, hiding in a fruit basket and reached Ko Raigad
 san 1674 tak shivaji ne un saare pradeshon par adhikaar kar liya tha, jo purandar kii sandhi ke antargat unhen mughalon ko dene pade the

 The explosion was reported in Moreh area of chandel district of Manipur
 yah dhamaakaa rajya police commando camp or nauveen assam rifl batalian ke headquarter se thodi duuri par hua
 No casualties have been reported so far
 gauratlab he ki chandel jile main hi ugravadiyon ne4 june ko ghaat laga hamalaa kiya tha, jisamen 18 javaanon kii maut ho gai thi
 After this, the army on Tuesday carried out the cross-border operation of the Myanmar border and killed 38 militants
 aise hua tha hamalaiidi visphot ke baad aatankiyon ne arpiji or swachaalit hathiyaaron se sena ke chaar vaahanon ke kafile par baari golibari shuru kar di
 Army spokesman Colonel Rohan Anand said in Delhi, '20 military personnel were martyred and 11 were injured in the attack
 ’ police ne bataaya ki ek sandigdh aatanki bhi maaraa gaya he
 The attack occurred around nine o'clock in the morning when the patrol team reached a location between Paralong and the four villages
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii ranneeti ke liye meerut main do dinon tak bijepi kaaryakarini kii baithak chali
 In this, all the veteran leaders of the state including National President Amit Shah and CM Yogi Adityanath knocked
 lekin bijepi ke teen bade chehre is baithak main shaamil nahin hue, jinhen lekar sawaal uthne lage hai
 Sugabhug in political corridors intensified after the absence of Union Minister for Women and Child Development Maneka Gandhi, Sultanpur MP Varun Gandhi and Bahraich MP Savitri Bai Phule
 in netaaon ke shaamil na hone ke raajnneetik myne nikaale jane lage hai
 All the mlas and mps of the state participated in the marathon meeting of the BJP State Executive in Meerut
 pilibhit se saansad or modi sarkaar main mantri menka gandhi or unke bete varun gandhi kaa shaamil na hona kai raajnneetik kayaason ko janm de rahaa he
 While Bahraich's Dalit MP Savitri Bai Phule has almost cleared her rebellious stance
 mana ja rahaa he kivarun gandhi naarazchal rahe hai
 Due to this, he has not attended many previous meetings of BJP
 raibareli or sultanpur ke amit shah ke kaarykram main bhi varun gandhi shaamil nahin hue
 They are constantly keeping themselves away from BJP meetings
 vahiin, menka gandhi kaa meerut ke rajya kaaryakarini main hissaa nahin lenaa nai siyasat kii ore ishaara kar rahi he
 On the last day of the State Executive held in Meerut, BJP President Amit Shah called a meeting of all the mlas and mps of UP on Sunday
 isamen pradesh ke maujuuda sabhi saansad or vidhayak aae lekin menka or varun is meeting kaa hissaa nahin bane
 Significantly, on one hand, Varun Gandhi is constantly angry with the top leadership of the party
 upi ke 2017 vidhansabha chunaav se pehle menka gandhi ne varun gandhi ko mukhyamantri pad kaa daavedaar bataakar raajnneetik halchal paidaa kar di thi
 After this, Varun Gandhi was removed from the post of general secretary during the expansion of the party's central organization
 isi ke baad varun naaraaz chal rahe hai
 On the other hand, the party is also angry with Varun Gandhi
 haalanki naaraazgi ke baavjood donon ore se kisi bhi tarah kii bayaanbaji se parhez hota rahaa he
 Even in the assembly elections, Varun kept himself away from the party's campaign
 bijepi ne bhi unhen zyada tavajjo nahin di thi
 Since then, Varun Gandhi has not appeared on any BJP platform in UP
 varun gandhi ke saath-saath kya unki maa menka gandhi bhi party se naaraaz he? aise main menka gandhi meerut kii pradesh kaaryakarini main shaamil na hone se kai sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 Is there resentment in Varun due to the sideline in the party or is there some other reason? BJP MP from Bahraich, Savitri Bai Phule is also taking an insurgent stand on the Dalit issue within the party
 aise main meerut kii baithak main shaamil na hone se sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 However, she is also increasing her drinking towards BSP
 in teenon netaaon kii naaraazgi 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main alag rasta akhriyaar karne ke liye to nahin he
 Let us know that the BJP has taken forward its politics by encircling the Gandhi family from the beginning
 1980 main sanjay gandhi kii maut ke baad menka gandhi kii indira gandhi se anban ho gai
 In such a situation, Maneka found her way away from the Congress
 rajeev gandhi ke khilaaf amethi se chunaav ladiin lekin jeet nahin sakin
 Maneka joined VP Singh's Janata Dal in 1988
 1989 main janata dal ke tikat par pilibhit se chunaav ladaa or jitkar loksabhaa pahunchin
 In 1999, she became an MP from Pilibhit as an independent candidate
 menka gandhi ne us vakt atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa centre main samarthan kiya or unhen centre main mantri bhi banaaya gaya
 Given the bjp's disenchantment, the party made the right move
 2004 main aadhikarik taur par menka gandhi bijepi main shaamil ho gayi
 Maneka reached MP on BJP ticket in 2004, 2009 and 2014 and became a minister
 menka kii tarj par varun gandhi ne bhi bijepi kaa daaman thama
 In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, he contested from his mother's parliamentary seat Pilibhit and won the MP
 iske baad 2014 main varun ne pilibhit ko chhodkar sultanpur seat ko chunaa or duusari baar record maton se jitkar saansad bane
 However, Varun has been uncomfortable in his style by targeting the Modi government on several occasions in the last four years
 jammu-kashmir main ashaanti banaae rakhane ke liye pakistan se funding ko lekar 'aaj tak' ke sting ke baad se shuru hui jaanch-padtaal chal rahi he
 In this connection, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has again called six more persons for question-answer, including traders and separatists
 in logon se NIA kii poochtacha jari he
 Documents already seized are also being investigated
 NIA srinagar menmohammad sultan, altaaf funtoosh, pir safulla, bitta karate, jahur vatali, tarik khan, jahur khan se poochtacha kar rahi he
 The NIA investigation against the separatists has revealed a lot
 NIA sutron se jaankaree mili he ki jab NIA kii team hurriyat netaaon ke yahaan chhap maarane ke liye ravivaar ke din gai thi, to pataa chalaa ki ek bag bhar ke kai dastavej hurriyat ke netaaon ne jala die the
 According to NIA sources, on Saturday, many important documents were seized from the NIA Nehurriyat leaders
 teror funding ke maamle kashmir main teror funding par shikanja kasne ke liye rashtriya jaanch agency kii jaanch chal rahi he
 The NIA raided the hideouts of the separatist leaders and seized objectionable documents including foreign exchange from there
 maharashtra main sarkaar gathan ko lekar abhi tak tasviir saaf nahinmaharashtra main shivasena pehle bhi kar chuki he congress ko samarthanmaharashtra main mukhyamantri pad ko lekar siyaasi sangram machaa hua he
 The Shiv Sena and the BJP are steadfast in their insistence, as a result of which the government has not been formed yet
 congress-ensipi maukey kii siyaasi najaakat ko bhaanpane main jute hai or apane pattey nahin khol rahe hai
 Despite this, the Shiv Sena is showing the power to form a government on the strength of Sharad Pawar's NCP and Congress
 aise main vaicharik rup se ek duusare ke virdohi congress or shivasena saath aate hai to koi aashcharya nahin hona chahie, kyonki kabhi baalsaheb thakare ne indira gandhi ko samarthan diya tha
 However, now the ball is in the court of Congress
 bataa den ki shivasena kii sthapana 1966 main balasaheb thakare ne mumbai main kii thi
 Shiv Sena's image was that of a staunch anti-congress party
 balasaheb thakare apane cartoonon main indira gandhi ko khub nishaanaa banaaya karte the
 Even after this, Shiv Sena shook hands with Congress
 1975 main balasaheb ne indira gandhi dwaara lagaae gaye apatkaal kaa saport karke sabko chaunkaa diya tha
 Even in the 1977 elections, Balasaheb Thackeray supported the Congress, but the Shiv Sena found this support very heavy
 1978 ke vidhansabha chunaav or biemasi chunaav main shivasena ko munh kii khaani padi
 The Shiv Sena received such a big shock that Balasaheb even offered his resignation at a rally at Shivaji Park
 halaki shivasainikon ke virodh ke baad ye istipha unhone waapas le liya
 After the Emergency was imposed in 1975, opposition leaders were being jailed
 kaha ye jaataa he ki maharashtra ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri shankarrav chavaan ne balasaheb ke saamne do vikalp rakhe yaa to duusare vipakshi netaaon kii tarah giraftaar ho jaaen yaa phir apatkaal ke samarthan kaa elaan kar den
 Balasaheb did not think it appropriate to go to jail and became in favor of emergency
 isse pehle bhi 1971 main balasaheb ne congress ke duusare dhade ke saath milaayaa tha
 In 1969, the Congress was divided
 piem pad par baithi indira gandhi ko congress ke puraane netaaon ne party se nikaal diya
 The class of these leaders standing against Indira Gandhi was known as the 'congress Syndicate'
 1971 main balasaheb ne congress (O) se haath milaayaa loksabhaa chunaav ke liye teen ummidavaar khadey kiye the
 However, all three were defeated
 vaise kaha ye jaataa he ki congress ne hi communiston ke khilaaf ladane ke liye shivasena ko khadaa karne main madad kii thi
 In the early days, Shiv Sena was called anti-vasant Sena after the then Chief Minister Vasantrao Naik
 1980 main shivasena ne congress ko loksabhaa chunaav main samarthan kiya tha
 Balasaheb did not field Shiv Sena candidates against the Congress
 isaki badi vajah bataai gai tatkaaleen mukhyamantri eaar antule ke saath balasaheb ke nijee rishte
 Not only this, Balasaheb supported two Congress candidates, Pratibha Patil and Pranab Mukherjee, for the presidential election
 1984 ke chunaav main balasaheb ne apni party ke do ummidavaar bijepi ke chunaav nishaan par khadey kiye the
 In 1989, the bjp-shiv Sena finalized its alliance, with Pramod Mahajan contributing heavily
 is gathbandhan main shivasena hameshaa bade bhai kii bhoomika main rahi
 Shiv Sena contested 183 seats out of 288 in the 1990 elections
 chote sahyogiyon ko shivasena ne apane cote se seat deen thi
 The same formula continued in 1995, when the bjp-shiv Sena came to power
 is fomurle main thodaa badlaav 1999 or 2004 main kiya gaya
 Balasaheb's lucky number is 9 due to hearing
 shivasena171 or bijepi 117 siton par chunaav ladi
 a slight change in this number occurred in the 2009 assembly elections, after which Shiv Sena contested for 169 and BJP 119 seats
 lekin maharashtra kii satta 15 saal congress-ensipi ke haathon main rahi
 The equation of saffron parties changed after Narendra Modi and Amit Shah emerged in BJP
 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main shivasena or bijepi kaa gathbandhan tut gaya, donon alag alag chunaav lade
 Shiv Sena got only 63 seats and BJP got 122 seats
 haalanki chunaav ke baad shivasena or bijepi ne milakar sarkaar banaai
 In 2019, BJP contested 164 seats and Shiv Sena 124 seats
 is dauraan kaha gaya ki satta ke samaan bantwaare ke liye ek formula tay hua he
 But what is this secret formula, neither BJP nor Shiv Sena disclosed this
 ab shivasena kah rahi he ki mukhyamantri pad ke dhai-dhai saal ke bantwaare kii baat hui he jabaki bijepi isse inkaar kar rahi he
 What is happening in Maharashtra at this time has probably never happened in India before
 bahumat nahin hone par rajnatik dal kisi tarah duusare dalon se jodtod karke sarkaar banane kii koshish karte hai bhale hi wo vichaardhaara ke str main ek duusare se kitne bhi alag hon ek duusare ke kitne bhi bade virdohi rahe hon lekin yahaan to sahyogi hi aapas main bhide hue hai
 The deadline is till 9 November to form the government in Maharashtra

 Asaram took out his anger on the media in Indore
 haalanki asaram ne ye mana ki wo peedit ko jaanate hai or wo unki potee ke samaan he
 Asaram said that when a person like him is accused of false allegations, then it can be understood that how many people in the society will have to run false cases

 The Congress party has created a ruckus in the Upper House over the inclusion of NOTA option by the Election Commission in the Rajya Sabha elections
 unhone is par kai sawaal khadey kar die
 In the Question Hour, Congress leader Anand Sharma raised the issue saying that the Congress party was not aware of it and the Election Commission made no such mention during the notification
 iske chalate sadan kii kaarywahi do baar sthagit karnaa padaa
 Responding to this, Rajya Sabha leader Arun Jaitley dismissed the issue saying that this is a special right of the Election Commission
 jaahir he raaj sabha chunaav main gujarat ko lekar congress or bijepi ke bich talavaarein khinchi hui he
 From the third seat of the Rajya Sabha, the Congress is strongly trying to return Ahmed Patel, the political advisor of Sonia Gandhi, to the Rajya Sabha
 vahi bhaajapa is seat par sendhamari main juty he
 The Congress party is not feeling everything on the option of NOTA
 is par ahamed patel ne ko twit karte hue kaha ki pehle to rajyasabha ke chunaav kii taarikh aage badha di gai or uske baad notification ke baad nota laane kii vajah kya he, yah chunaav ayog ko hi maaloom he
 The decision of the Election Commission was not true in the book of law, Congress Rajya Sabha MP Kapil Sibal also questioned the timing of the Election Commission
 unka maananaa he ki yah faisla kanoon kii kitaab main khara nahin baithta
 It is noting that POTA is happening
 unhone kaha ki jo faisla chunaav ayog ne liya he mujhe lagata he kahin naa kahin masalaa gujarat kaa he
 Because the Trinamool has the number in Bengal at the moment
 chunaav ayog ne kyon aisa faisla liya he? agar aap kanoon kii kitaab ko dekho yaa koi rule dekho koi aisi prakriya rule main nahin he naa hi riprogentation of pipal act main he
 He said that this is open voting
 indiarect voting he, isamen koi diarect voting nahin he isamen to aap apni prefrence denge
 So where did this decision come from? He also said that i do not want to make any allegations
 agar chunaav ayog ne faislalia to zarur soch-samaj kar liya he
 But its timing is not right
 bataa den ki supreme court ne piusiel ke ellection main kaha tha kidiarect voting main aapako notadena chahie
 This is the Election Commission's own decision
 ise chunaav ayog ne supreme court ke jariye nahin liya

 lekin 1993 main paanch rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan ‘‘aaj paanch pradesh, kal puraa desh’’ kaa naaraa lagane vaale bijepi netaa selective dementia (smriti lop) ke shikaar hai
 On December 6, 1992, the then BJP president LK Advani and Kalyan Singh, who were considered heroes of the Babri Masjid demolition, kept saying that the people's court would justify the demolition in the election
 chunavi bayaanbani ke daur main kalyaan singh ne kaha tha ki agar uttar pradesh main unki party ko 221 (tab uske paas itani hi siten thim) se ek seat bhi kam mili to yah mandir andolan ke nakaare jane kaa sanket hoga
 In the 1993 elections after the demolition of Babri Masjid, his party won not one but 44 seats in the state
 antat samaajawaadee party (sapa) or bahujan samaaj party (bispi) ko 176 siten milin jo bijepi se mahaj ek kam thim
 But since then the politics of the country and especially the state has changed forever
 mandal kii kaat ke taur par ‘‘hindu samaaj ko ekajute’’ karne vaala ‘‘kamandal’’ kaa andolan duusare andolanon kii tarah apni miyaad puri kar gaya
 The communities that became the backbone of the temple movement went on to cut it off for their political gains
 rajnatik jaagrukta ne bispi kii mayawati ko pradesh kii aisi iklauti netaa bana diya jo daliton kaa vot kisi ko bhi transfar kar sakati hai
 The despised "mullah" Mulayam Singh Yadav, along with his caste, became the leader of Muslims with full rights
 rajya ke sabase bade samudaayon ke paale badalane ke saath hi agadi jatiyon ne apane siyaasi vajood ke liye bijepi kaa daaman tham liya
 The result: The Congress, which has led Dalits, Muslims and Brahmins in the state for four decades, has been away from power since 1989
 mandir andolan ke jariye raajnneeti chamakaane vaali bijepi haalanki masjid vidhwans ke baad rajya main do baar ke kaarykaal main kul paanch saal bhi shashan nahin kar pai par centre main pahunch gai
 Now away from power in the state for more than a decade, this party feels that the path to the throne of Delhi goes through Ayodhya itself
 is saal 31 janvari ko jab bijepi-sangh-vishwa hindu parishad (viechpi) ke varisht netaa dilli main saansad shripad yeso nik ke ghar jamaa hue to tay ho gaya ki bijepi vikaas or sushasan ke mudde ko aage badhayegi to viechpi ram mandir andolan ko phir se khadaa kar dhruvikaran kii ruparekha banaaegi
 At the same time, it was decided that the VHP would agitate on the saints and the bjp-sangh would give political support to it
 lekin tisare morche kii sambhaavna ke maddenjar mulaayam bhi koi mauka nahin ganvaana chaahate
 "netaji" listened softly to his 84 Kosi parikrama during a meeting with VHP leaders on 17 August afternoon
 unhone usee din shaam ko babari masjid acshan cameti ke sanyojak or pradesh ke atirikt mahadhivaktaa jafarayab jilani ko 5, vikramaditya maarg vaale bangle par mashvire ke liye bulaayaa
 In the context of the campaign to launch 84 Kosi Parikrama, Jilani made his point in three points: What is the rationale for the journey that did not take place during the BJP and Congress rule during the SP government? The yatra means political and it will be a direct violation of the orders of the Supreme Court
 ant main jilani kaa tark tha ki agar mulaayam is yatra kii anumati dete hai to iske nateezon ke liye bhi vahi jimmedaar honge
 The next day when the cabinet minister of SP government arrived Jam Khan opened his front against VHP leaders, Mulayam hinted to his party's government to ban the proposed revision of VHP
 is tarah krishna or hanumanbhakt ‘‘netaji’’ ne viechpi netaaon ke saamne naram rukh apanaate hue muslim samarthakon ko saadhe rakhane kaa prayaas kar vyaavhaarik raajnneeti kaa parichay diya
 By dividing the temple-mosque issue between the BJP and the SP, Mulayam took the Congress to the margins of state politics in one stroke
 haal main noida ke kadalpur gaanv main masjid kii diwaar ‘‘dhahaane’’ ke iljaam main esadm durga shakti nagpal ko nilambit karne vaali sarkaar ne paramparaagat musalmaan matadaataaon ko rijhaane kii koi kasar nahin chodi he
 But Mulayam knows that now only in the name of saving the mosque, Muslim votes cannot be obtained
 lihaaja, 25 agast ko ayodhya se shuru hone vaali santon kii 84 kosi parikrama par pratibandh lagane ke 24 ghante ke bheetar sapa sarkaar ne soobe ke 30 sarkari vibhaagon kii 85 kalyankari yojanaon main alpsankhyakon-musalmaan, sikh, isai, baudgh, parsi or jain samudaay-ke liye 20 fisadi hissedari kaa nirdhaaran kar loksabhaa chunaav se pehle musalamaanon ko rijhaane kaa ek or bada daanv chal diya
 19 of minorities in the state
 33 fisadi aabaadi he jisamen musalamaanon kii aabaadi 18
 5 percent
 musalamaanon ke bich sapa kii lamabandi ne bijepi ke liye bhi pichley dedh dashakon ke dauraan upi main apni khoi jameen ko waapas lene kaa avasar de diya he
 To fully capitalize on the occasion, the BJP first tried to bring in the Hindutva agenda by bringing back the former Chief Minister Kalyan Singh who had emerged as a hero of the Ram Mandir movement
 yahi nahin, agle loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne teen fire brands netaaon uma bharti, varun gandhi or yogi adityanath ke saath puure pradesh main gupachup tareeke se hindutv ke agenda ke sahare aage badaae kii taiyaari kii he
 Not only this, for the first time Adityanath's guardian Hindu Yuva Vahini is expanding into the western districts
 jhaansi main muslim bahut ilaake main bane acharchit shiv mandir ko achaanak mudda banane or parisar se musalamaanon ko baahar karwaane kii adityanath kii yojana kaaphi had tak kargar rahi
 Adityanath finalized the organization of the Hindu Yuva Vahini in these districts by meeting in Meerut on 21 June and two months later on 21 August in Ghaziabad
 yuva vahini ke pradesh adhyaksh raghavendra pratap singh bataate hai, ‘‘hamaara sanghathan pratikriyaavaadi he
 In order to deal with the manner in which the SP government of the state is trying to appease Muslim appeasement and polarization of votes, it was necessary to expand the youth corps into western districts and Bundelkhand
 ’’lekin congress or bispi, donon 84 kosi parikrama mudde ko sapa or bijepi kii mileebhagat maanati hai
 Nirmal Khatri, president of the state Congress and MP from Faizabad, asks, "why does the VHP announce such movements when the SP government comes?" The BSP has organized small seminars from the village to the block level of the SP and BJP
 a strategy has been made to make the public aware of collusion
 bispi ke rashtriya mahasachiv nasimuddin siddiki bataate hai, ‘‘pradesh main sapa sarkaar banane ke baad se musalmaan sabase zyada peedit he
 SP is once again trying to mislead Muslims by showing fear of riots
 ’’sapa ne sambhawatah isi ke maddenjar aarthik pralobhan dena shuru kar diya he, lekin bijepi ab bhi rajya main keval hindutv ke mudde ko garmaane main lagi he
 Even though "the return of 5 per cent GDP, Dalmia in BCCI, Murthy in Infosys, Nawaz Sharif in Pakistan, Madhuri Dixit in Bollywood and Sanjay Dutt's return to jail are showing the return of '90s" but in the meantime a lot of water has flowed in Saryu

 a post shared by Mandira Bedi (@mandirabedi) on Feb 8, 2018 at 8:41pm PST Zafaryab Jilani referred to the statement of Hafiz, who taught Taraweeh prayers in Babri Masjid in 1945–46
 jilani ne ek gavaah kaa bayaan padhate hue kaha ki usne 1939 main magarib kii namaaz babari masjid main padhi thi
 Zafaryab Jilani is trying to prove on the statement of the witnesses of the Muslim side that even after 1934 the Namaz was read at the disputed site
 hindu paksh kii taraf se supreme court main jirah ke dauraan yah daleel di gai ki 1934 ke baad vivaadit sthal par namaaj nahin padhi gai thi
 After lunch, senior advocate Rajiv Dhawan started the debate on behalf of the Muslim side
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki nirmohi akhaada ne sirf prabhaar or prabandhan ke liye andar ke ahaate ke adhikaar ke liye yachika daakhil kii
 Dhawan said that earlier Hindus used to worship in the outside yard but on 22-23 December 1949 the idol was wrongly shifted inside the mosque
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki nirmohi akhde kaa kahana he ki vah shebet he or prabandhan ke adhikaar se vanchit he
 If a new temple is built then the Nirmohi Arena will be its Shebet
 dhawan ne kaha ki 1885 main mahant raghubar das ke mukademe ko pehle nirmohi akhaade ne nakaar diya tha lekin baad main nirmohi akhdaa kaa mahant maan liya tha
 Earlier, the term Nirmohi Akhara had rejected the word birthplace but later it was considered in the judicial entry
 rajeev dhawan ne sthaan ko juristic person kahe jane kii daleel par uthaae gaye sawaal par kaha ki hindu paksh ne tark diya he ki nadiyon, pahaado, kuon ke liye prarthana kii jaati he
 i argue that this is a Vedic practice
 jahaan tak vedon kaa sawaal he, ve ise puujate hai, lekin is rup main nahin
 You pray to the Sun, but do not call it your jurisdiction
 dhawan ne kaha ki swayambhu kaa concept yah hota he ki ishwar khud ko parilakshith karata he, jaise koi parvat yaa maansarovar, isse yah sabit nahin hota ki is tarah ke swayambhu ishwar swaroopon kii juristic personality hi ho
 The hearing of the Ayodhya Ramjanmabhoomi case will continue on Monday
 muslim paksh kii taraf se rajeev dhawan paksh rakhenge

 ' Supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav, who is serving a three-and-a-half year jail term in the fodder scam case, has restructured his party's national executive
 buudhvaar ko 83 sadsy rashtriya kaaryakarini kii suchi jari kii gai
 According to the new list, while Lalu Prasad Yadav will continue to be the chairman of the rjd's national executive, he has been made the party's vice-president, giving important responsibilities to his wife and former Chief Minister Rabri Devi
 rabari devi pehali baar rashtriya kaaryakarini kii upaadhyaksh bani he
 Apart from Rabri, senior party leaders Raghuvansh Prasad Singh and Shivanand Tiwari have also been retained as party vice-presidents
 rashtriya kaaryakarini main rabari ko ek taraf jahaan badi jimmedaari di gai he, vahiin duusari taraf argedy ke purv saansad or mafia don shahabuddin ko rashtriya kaaryakarini se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya gaya he
 Significantly, during the last reorganization of the national executive, Lalu made Shahabuddin a member of the executive, after which he was accused of giving protection to criminals
 shahabuddin kii jagah unki patni hina shahaab ko rashtriya kaaryakarini kaa sadsy banaaya gaya he
 But the most interesting thing is that Lalu's family dominates the national executive
 rashtriya kaaryakarini main sadsy ke rup menlaluke donon bete tej pratap yadav or tejasvi yadav samet badi beti misa bharti kii bhi entry ho gai he
 Somewhere in the rjd's national executive, the grip of Lalu Kunbe can be clearly seen
 argedy kii rashtriya kaaryakarini ke punargathan ko lekar jadyu ne argedy par hamalaa bolaa he or kaha he ki bhartiya loktantr ke itihaas main aisa pehali baar hua he, jab kisi raajnneetik dal ke sajayaftaa rashtriya adhyaksh ne jail se hi rashtriya kaaryakarini kaa elaan kar diya he
 Regarding showing Shahabuddin out of the national executive, the JDU said that despite being a convict, Lalu Prasad Yadav will continue to be the president of the national executive, but the convict Shahabuddin has been removed from the executive
 jadyu ne kaha ki lalu ke is kadam se unka alpsankhyak prem kaa paakhand saaf najar aata he
 The whole country is crazy
 garmi sar par, or chunaav sar se utar hi nahin rahaa
 Quickly arrive on 16 May and relieve us of this nine-phase election
 abhi tak thik-thaak nipat gaya he, baaki bhi shanti se nipat jaave to chaiyn aave
 The man will not wait so much for God in today's age, as much as the election is ending
 achche din aane vaale hai kaa gaanaa baj rahaa he
 There are many who do not like it at all
 par sab kii ichha he ki bura he yaa acha he, aa jaae bas
 They come, they will come, they will be coming, by saying this, we have passed away shab-e-gum
 shab-e-gam guzar gai yaa aa rahi he, ye koun jane par shaam kaa rang kabhi sinduri to kabhi dhoosar
 With the changing color, the world is unable to understand what the morning of this night will be like

 Modi himself is Modi-like and the colors are changing as the weather changes

 This means that the people there are racist

 abhi to janata hi prabhu he
 This poem has become very famous that Ram Lala, we will come, will build the temple there, but will not tell the date

 Then people do not even hum it to Ayodhya
 modi ji faijabad gaye to ramalala kii tasviir thi manch par lekin munh se mandir nahin niklaa
 Because there was no need
 mandir se vot nahin milte
 In one time, the temple had increased from two seats to 80 seats
 ab utane kaam kaa nahin rahaa, isliye ghoshnaptr ke aakhri panne par do vaakyon main nipta diya
 Caste is from religion only
 modiji kaa jati prem netaji kaa jati prem nahin, janataji kaa jati prem he
 Khap is also the father when needed
 haryana main har party khap panchayaton ko jarurat bataati hai apni jarurat ke hisaab se
 Who should fight with those who decide the vote of the tribe? What is the reason that some areas of the country have lagged behind? Resources and opportunities were reduced
 jatvaad kamobesh puure desh main he
 Casteism has deep roots, but always takes roots down
 jin ilaakon main log pattee-tahaniyon par dhyaan dene lage, vah fale-foole
 If needed, gave water, but instead of keeping the root alive, woke the fruits from insects and thieves
 jo jadon par garv karte rahe, vah jameen main gadate gaye
 This is the difference between root and conscious
 jad adhogati kaa pratik he
 Consciousness is there in consciousness
 is maamle main modi chetan chouhan hai, chuknaa nahin chaahate
 Modi came from need, not from racist thinking
 vah to vikaas kaa jhunjhuna vahiin bajaate hai, jahaan log vikaas se bahal jate hai
 Where bread and rice are served, serve bread and pulses, and who should take power
 jaisaa des vaisaa bhes
 Water changes here at kos-kos
 janata badal jaati he, to netaa bhi badal jate hai
 These leaders tell the public their status
 laluji muslim yadav kaa maai sameekaran banaate hai kyonki logon ko sameekaran bana rahanaa acha lagata he
 Laluji will not need to do all this, if Muslims and Yadav will say that we are not going to get away with it
 halaat badaliye nahin to haath maliye
 How much has the situation changed for the tribals of Jharkhand in the last 14 years with tribal chief ministers
 jab tak vah khush hai kisi netaa ko kute ne kaata he ki vah halaat badalenge
 The public is racist
 netaa sirf votwadi hai

 The Supreme Court has reprimanded the state government for the suicide of farmers in Tamil Nadu
 court ne kaha ki kisaanon kii haalat vaaki behad chintajanak he or rajya sarkaar is maanviya traasadee par shant nahi baith sakati
 The Supreme Court said that in such situations it is the responsibility of the government to take care of its citizens
 court nerajya sarkaarko notice jari kar do hafte ke bheetar jawaab maanga he
 With this, the court has directed that the state government should show seriousness in response to this petition and should not take it like any other ordinary petitions

 Perhaps this is the reason why the Hon'ble Supreme Court has taken a cognizance of this case and reprimanded the State Government and said that it should discharge its responsibilities

 yachika par sunwaayee ke dauraan hi sarkaar ne us niyam ko radd kar diya tha jisamen trakon se 1 meter baahar tak sarie baahar rakhane kii ijaajat di gai thi
 Because of this, there was no need to hear this issue
 haalanki, isi yachika main sadak kinare khadey trakon or duusari gadiyon kaa bhi masalaa uthaaya gaya tha jo haadase kii vajah banate hai
 Thousands are injured by a car parked on the road
according to official figures, more than 9 thousand people die every year only due to accidents on the road or on roadside vehicles and thousands of people are injured
 yachika main aisi gadiyon se hone vaali durghatnaon ke bare main bataaya gaya tha
 The government had to answer for making guidelines regarding these
 lekin ye jawaab abhi tak nahin aayaa he
 3-week time to reply The court has given the central government 3 weeks to file the reply
 court ne ye bhi kaha kii sarkaar ke paas aakhri mauka he jawaab dene ke liye
 Significantly, the government and the judiciary are face to face to form a new mop of the collegium for the appointment of judges
 abhi kuch din pehle bhi kanoon mantri ravi shankar prasad ne kaha tha kii sarkaar ye koshish kar rahi he kii jajon kii niyukti kii prakriya ko paardarshee banaaya jaae or jajon ke khilaaf aane vaali shikaayat ko lekar ek alag vyavastha ho or jajon kii jimmedaari tay honi chahie
