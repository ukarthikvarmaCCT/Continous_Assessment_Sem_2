 Mehul Bhai is sitting here, Mehul Bhai may not be in Davos but he is in a government program
 davos main neerav modi kii tasviir he, jinke bare main ravishankar prasad kaa kahana he ki siaiai lekar gai
 Anyway, when the Prime Minister knows that no matter how big a jeweler is, people buy gold from their village goldsmith, then should the Prime Minister not have done the same check before taking photographs in Davos
 yah bhi ek tathy he ki photo khinchaa lene se neerav modi ko chhot nahin mili
 An FIR was lodged against him on 29 January and 5 February

 The Congress stated that the FIR stated that between 9 February 2017 and 14 February 2017, eight fake letters of understanding were issued
 kya ravishankar prasad ne iskaa jawaab diya? Ravi Shankar Prasad said that if he is abroad, then action has also been taken abroad
 exiaar yahaan hui he to vahaan kya carrawai ho rahi he
 Is the opening of the show room after the FIR also action? They should have told if a lookout notice has been issued against Nirav Modi? Punjab National Bank shares have fallen by 11 per cent
 iske niveshkon ko 3000 karod kaa nuksaan ho chukaa he
 All this will not come back, but do not go over the pictures of this feat of banking sector and diamond trade

 Who is whose tenant, these are all mild questions, the only question is how the scam of 11,300 crores was fraudulent? Keep an eye on the banking sector, whose condition is already bad

 Did Ravi Shankar Prasad answer this? ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki agar ve videsh main he to videsh main bhi karrwai hui he
 If the FIR is done here then what action is being done there

 "according to PDP activists like Amin, a major part of this problem is in fact the chief minister's own failure as she has not been able to involve the party in whatever sporadic work of governance and development between the current situation
 amin hataasha main kehete hai, ''kaaryakartaaon ko katkar rakhaa gaya
 "they cite the pardon scheme for young stone-pelters, including Ladli launched for daughters and two social welfare schemes called Asra for poor families, in which there was no attempt to involve the grassroots workers of the party
 
 ve poochhate hai, ''hamen to bemaani bana diya gaya he
 Then why would anyone listen to us? ”A lower-caste leader of the party, who was active in the historic victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections against former Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah, says that the pdp's defeat in the April 9 by-election in the valley has been a declining support for the party Is a sign of anantnag main chaahe jab bhi chunaav hon, ve kehete hai ki party ke garh dakshini kashmir main ''pidipi kii dikkatein usase or badhengi" jahaan party kaa majboot janaadhar teji se sikuda he
 a top police officer familiar with the electoral trends in Kashmir seems to agree, "the PDP defeat in Srinagar is a strong message to the party leadership
" " ve bataate hai ki kangan jaise ilaakon main bhi, jahaan 2016 ke asantosh ke dauraan na koi hinsa hui or na hi hatya, vahaan bhi 2014 ke mukaable ek-tihaai se kam matadaata vot dene nikle
 When Habuba and his colleagues were not even aware of this, in 2016, a security dossier was sent to the Union Home Ministry in Delhi, which spoke of increasing segregation among PDP voters
 yah 8 july ko hui burhan vaani kii hatya se kuch hakrate pehle kii baat he

 inamen jamaat or algaavvaadi samoohon ke badi sankhya main yuva shaamil hai jo is ashanka ko bal de rahe hai ki bhaajapa / aresas unki muslim or kashmiri hone kii pahchaan ko nasht kar denge
 These elements are constantly on the lookout for provocations so that people can get out on the streets
 " yah akalan hakeekat ke kitna kareeb tha, kehane vaali baat nahin he
 Apart from his desperate activists, Mehbooba is also facing problems with senior party colleagues like old leader Muzaffar Baig
 mufti kii pehali sarkaar main up-mukhyamantri rah chuke beg ne kaha he ki bhaajapa ke saath gathbandhan karke pidipi ne apni rajnatik jameen kaa ek bada hissaa ganvaa diya he
 They are even suggesting that Mehbooba should break this relationship and go back to the "public" and try to win her trust
 "mufti said ke chaar bacchon main sabase badi or unki uttaradhikari mahabuuba ne apana pehla chunaav 1996 main congress ke tikat par bijabehara se us vakt ladaa tha jab chah saal ke raashtrapati shashan ke baad party kaa cheharaa banane ke liye log taiyaar nahin ho rahe the
 In 1999, when Mufti decided to break ties with the Congress, she was standing firmly behind her father and was again leading a new party
 saath kaam karte hue mufti ne srinagar main kashmir-kendrit ek ranneeti taiyaar kii jabaki mahabuuba jamini str par use utaarne ke kaam main athak rup se lagi raheen, jisase ve pidipi kaa cheharaa banakar ubharin
 The party won 16 seats in 2002 and formed a government in association with the Congress, with arrangements to make Mufti the chief minister for three years
 mahabuuba ne 2008 main apni siton kii sankhya 21 tak pahunchaa di or agle chah saal neshnal conference-congress gathbandhan ke khilaaf lagaataar sakriy raheen
 The decisive opportunity for the party came in 2014 when the PDP won all the three Lok Sabha seats in the Valley and seven months later formed a government with the BJP with 28 seats
 mahabuuba ne jab 4 april, 2016 ko mukhyamantri kaa kaarybhaar sambhala, tab unke saamne chunautiyon kii bharmaar thi
 Apart from balancing the ropes between Srinagar and Delhi, Kashmir and Jammu, and the Muslim-dominated PDP and Hindu nationalist BJP, he also had a challenge from the government, which he had virtually no experience with
 yah baat unke takreeban har kaam main turant jhalak kar saamne aa gai, phir chaahe vah 2016 ke aarambh main prashasnic pherbadal kaa masalaa ho yaa burhan vaani kii maut ke baad skulon ko dobaaraa kholane kaa kaam
 Some people say that Mehbooba is under the counsel of advisors
 inamen kuch naukarshah or netaa hai, jaise sartaaj madani jo unke mamaa hai or pidipi ke mahasachiv bhi hai
 The list includes Public Works Minister Naeem Akhtar, former MLA Pirzada Mansoor Hussain, his newly appointed Chief Secretary Bharat Bhushan Vyas and Mufti's old confidant and eminent academic Amitabh Mattoo
 aaj pidipi ke kader bhaajapa ke saath gathjod karne kii samajhadaari par pehle se kahin zyada mukhar hokar sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 Apparently, Mufti Saeed's dream of bridging the widening religious and political gap between Srinagar and Jammu has been feticide
 donon ilaake or donon kii janata kaaphi dur chale gaye hai
 Last year, some members of an all-party delegation headed by Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh made a failed attempt to negotiate with the Hurriyat separatists
 agar is iklaute vaakye ko chhod den, to pidipi or bhaajapa ke bich paraspar sahmati se nirmit agenda—''sabhi aantarik hitdharakon ke saath tikaoo or sarthak samvaad" kaa vaada-samjhaute kii mej se gaayab ho chukaa he
 On April 28, the country's Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, while replying on a petition filed in the Supreme Court on behalf of the Bar Association of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court, made Delhi's position quite clear on the issue of dialogue with separatists
 unhone adaalat se kaha tha ki centre kii ''algaavvaadiyon se or un logon se jo bharat ke prati vafaadaar nahin hai, baatcheet karne kii koi yojana nahin he
 "if there is any doubt left on this side of Delhi, one should see the reaction of bjp's Ram Madhav, who drafted the Rajkaja's agenda with the PDP — he praised this aspect of the Center
 aresas se aae bhaajapa ke mahasachiv madhav ne srinagar ke liye dilli kaa nayaa mantra padhate hue kaha tha, ''aatankiyon or unke praayojakon ke saath adhiktam kathorta se bartaav kiya jaae
 The stubborn youth who took to the streets with stones in their hands should be treated efficiently so that violence can be ended, but keep in mind that lives are lost in it
 "dilachasp baat yah he ki kashmiri algaavvaadiyon ke saath samvaad bahaali ke masale par badale hue rukh or natijatan pidipi ke bheetar machi halchal ke baavjood ram madhav or bhaajapa main jammu-kashmir ke prabharee avinaash raay khanna, donon kaa kahana he ki gathbandhan ke saamne koi khatra nahin he
 Mehbooba, however, tells India Today in a cautious speech, "the alliance is as strong as the agenda of the alliance
" "pradhanmantri narendra modi se 24 april ko dilli main hui mulaakaat ke dauraan mahabuuba ne algaavvaadiyon ke saath samvaad kii prakriya ko dobaaraa shuru karne par bal diya tha
 They are not going to give up so soon
 mukhyamantri ne srinagar main party ke netaaon ko sambodhit karte hue yah sweekaar kiya ki kisi bhi kism kii baatcheet ke aage badaae ke liye jaruri he ki halaat kam se kam saamaanya jaise dikhaai dena shuru hon
 He said, "dialogue is the only way to get Kashmir out of the gark it is in today
 " unhone sujhaayaa ki baatcheet ko us sire se aage badhaayaa jaae, jahaan madhyasthon kii report, paanch kaarysamoohon kii report or gathbandhan ke agenda main vah chhot gai thi
 He emphasized that "it should not be impossible to find ten such things which can be worked upon without compromising the national interest"
 kashmir par samvaad ke liye mahabuuba dilli ko kisi tarah manaa len, usase pehle unhen gharelu str par punap chuke ugravad se nibatane kii chunauti kaa saamana karnaa hoga, algaav main pade yuvaaon se sampark kaayam karnaa hoga or in sab ke bich tehre hue rajkaaj or vikaas ke kaam ko bhi nae sire se shuru karnaa hoga
 Waheedurrahman Para, the head of the pdp's youth unit, has a different view on the issue
 unka maananaa he ki yah baatcheet bahupaksheeya honi chahie or khud pradhanmantri ko ''bhaavnaatmak" tareeke se isaki aguai kerani chahie
 Para says that dealing with terrorists is not a problem, "the next challenge is to negotiate with the entire generation of young Kashmiris who are being made part of the violence
 " ghati main rahane waalon main 60 fisadi yuva hai jinamein kareeb 20 lakh chaatr hai jinaki umr 38 saal se kam he
 Obviously, this task will not be as easy
 rajya ke ek police afasar kehete hai ki kashmiri yuvaaon main vyaapt algaav ko baaki desh main ghat rahi ghatnaon se paidaa hua bhay or zyada hawa de rahaa he
 He has spent a lot of time talking to young stone-pelters, especially the youths brought to the police station on this charge
 unka maananaa he ki uttar pradesh ke dadri main mohammad akhlaaq kii hatya se lekar gorakshakon kii lagaataar kii ja rahi vaaradaaten, rajasthan main kashmiri yuvaaon kii pitayee or surakshabalon par pathar phenk rahe yuvaaon ke khilaaf swayambhu senaayen khadi karne kii dakshinpanthi hindu girohon kii dhamkee vagairah ghati main asuraksha ke maahaul ko badha rahi hai
 This is further exacerbating the extremist sentiments within the Kashmiri youth, who are already in the grip of the jihadi propaganda on the internet and listening to the ravages of around 3,000 new Wahhabi mosques that have grown in the Valley during the last 15 years 
 paara maanate hai ki gathbandhan ke agenda par chizon ko aage badha paane main pidipi ko jo naakaami haath lagi he, usase khaali hui rajnatik jameen par ab algaavvaadiyon or ugravadiyon kaa kabja ho rahaa he
 They particularly cite the example of southern Kashmir — Anantnag, Pulwama, Kulgam and Shopian — where the PDP had no opposition in the form of National Conference or Congress
 iske alaava ghati main tehre hue vikaas ko behaal karke aage badhanaa bhi ek ahm kaam he
 Mehbooba and her government have lost a full year due to all the focus on the challenges of law and order
 is dauraan sadakon ko durust karne, unke nirmaan, srinagar ko jam se raahat dilaane ke liye banaae jane vaale fliowaron or bhavishya kii baadh se bachane ke liye jhelum ke pravaah ko dur karne jaise kaam thande baste main daal die gaye hai
 On the one hand, Mehbooba's administration has been sluggish, on the other hand Delhi has been lagging behind in terms of fund release
 dilli main 27 april ko rajnath singh kii adhyakshata main yojit mantristareey baithak main yah baat saamne ai ki pradhanmantri modi kii ore se rajya ke liye ghoshit 80,000 karod ru

 He says, "the insurgency then continued lightly but the roads were quiet
 "paara kehete hai ki haal ke dinon main bhi jo pahal hui hai, jaise makapa ke netaa seetaram yechuri kii aguai main pichhali garmiyon main yahaan aae saansad samooh ke prayaas yaa purv vitt mantri yashavanth sinha kii koshishen, unase kaaphi ummid jaagi he

" "bhaajapa kaa dilli or jammu main baitha netritv chaahe jo sochataa ho lekin kashmir main party ke pravaktaa khalid jahangir khud samvaad ke himachati hai
 They are, however, not entitled to any specific agreement with the separatists, which has repeatedly proved to be fruitless
 " isaki bajaae jahangir kaa maananaa he ki pradhanmantri modi ko kashmiriyon ke har tabake ke saath ek golmes sammelan rakhana chahie
 He says, "the Hurriyat leaders may not attend this meeting, as they did in 2006
" manmohan singh se milane se inkaar kar diya tha! aisa karke ve hameshaa ke liye khud kaa pardaafash kar denge
 "lahal center is not thinking of any dialogue
 suraksha sutara kehete hai ki ''jameen par or zyada surakshabal utaarne kii yojana he
 "sources believe that this will undoubtedly help in stopping terrorist violence but its broad objective, according to them, is to capture the entire area so that the stone-pelting protesters can be thwarted
 mahabuuba kii cabinet main shaamil bhaajapa ke ek varisht mantri bhi kuch aisa hi kehete hai, ''bakt aa gaya he ki dilli har kism kaa tushtikaran band kare or kashmir ke logon ko vastav main is baat kaa ehsaas karwaae ki ek sangharsh ke kshetra main jeena kaisaa ho saktaa he
 "according to the security officials, the revelation behind the change in the policy of the Center on Kashmir is also working that Pakistan wants to keep the situation boiling there by" venting people's dissatisfaction "
 ek adhikari kehete hai ki jammu-kashmir main 250 se bhi kam ugravadi hai jinamein 214 kii pahchaan police record main darj he; inamen 60 fisadi sthaneey noujvaan hai jinamein takreeban sabhi hijbul mujahidin se hai or dakshini kashmir main sakriy hai
 There is strong evidence that these militants are working closely with over 3,000 such ogws (overground activists) who help mobilize the youth in isolation
 rajya ke ek police adhikari kehete hai, ''or isamen zyaadaatar hissaa niyantran rekha ke paar se prabandhit kiya ja rahaa he
 "police officials have recently come to know that around 60 whatsapp groups are being managed from Pakistan and its occupied Kashmir, each of which has 250 young members of the Valley

 Says a police officer, "it is tremendously organized
 "in chunautiyon ke alaava mahabuuba ke saamne ek or dikkat yah he ki unki tulana unke marhoom pita ke saath kii jaati he jis par unka akhriyaar nahin he
 Although he has been credited with standing PDP on its own since 1999, most people consider Mehbooba as raw in terms of coordination with the government and the Center
 pidipi ke shuruaati kaarykaal main 2002 se 2006 ke bich mukhyamantri kii suraksha main tainaat rahe ek aalaa police afasar kehete hai, ''mufti said kahin zyada chatur rajaneta the jinhen logonki baaten chupchaap sunakar use samajhnaa or lagu karnaa aata tha
 "they say that Mehbooba" gets entangled in minor things, is biased and is skeptical of trusting her colleagues
 " unki sabase badi takat logon se judye kii kshamta he lekin mukhyamantri banane ke baad ve jis tareeke se mukhyamantri karyaalay tak mahadood ho gai hai, bahut mumkin he ki yah kaushal bhi unke haath se jaataa rahe
 Abdul Ghani Bhat, a moderate leader of the Hurriyat and a classmate and ally of Mufti Saeed, who was in his eighth decade of age, is more liberal in the matter of Mehbooba
 ve kehete hai, ''yah tulana hi bemaani he
 Mehbooba has inherited a controversy that began in 1947 and lasted for generations
 " bhat kehete hai ki unke pita kaa is str par chizon se saamana hi nahin hua tha
 He may be different from his father, but Mehbooba Mufti's intention is to pass what he thought would happen if his father were alive at this point

 They put everything at stake to bring Jammu and Kashmir closer and did not give up until they were convinced that the end had arrived
 "mukhyamantri ek kissa sunaanaa nahin bhuulati hai jab 1990 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ne unke pita par gusse kaa izhaar kiya tha ki unase shriganr main ek bhi kashmiri milane nahin aayaa

 On April 30 at his residence in Srinagar, the Chief Minister told India Today, "my point is that Kashmir is with us and we also have land, but we should not get to the point where we have to ask ourselves:" Are we losing Kashmir? ”that is why the BJP may have withdrawn from the 16-page shared agenda of the alliance formed in March 2015, but continued to speak to the allies of the Mehbooba Party
 She is saying that she will not give up trying

 He is confident that the former finance minister, who has gained some degree of credibility among the residents of the valley, will be the best medium to move forward

 He has conveyed this to Delhi and said that his party and government are ready to play the role of "mediator" and will do the necessary ground work to make the dialogue possible

 CM Yogi ate food at the house of Dalit family Dayaram Saroj in Madhupur village of Pratapgarh on Monday, which was discussed a lot
 lekin isi khaane ke dauraan yogi kii mantri swati singh kaa roti banaae jane kaa mudde ko bispi ne pakad liya he or hawa deni shuru kar di he
 Describing it as a drama, BSP supremo Mayawati said that even though Yogi Adityanath may have eaten food at the house of a Dalit, he ate bread made by Swati Singh
 yogi ke liye swati singh ne banaai rotibta den ki swati singh thakur jati se aati hai or dalit parivaar dayaram saroj ke rasoi main baithkar yogi adityanath ke liye roti banaai thi
 Swati Singh is the minister in charge of Pratapgarh
 aise main unke roti banane kii photo saarvajinak hui, jise bispi ne alag rang dene main juty he
 The BSP has started calling it a drama for the bjp's Dalit love on the pretext of the issue
 'dalit ke ghar khaanaa khaaen or banaaenge'bijepi pravaktaa dow chandramohan kehete hai ki bijepi ke daliton ke choukhat or chuulhe tak panhuchane se bispi baukhala gai hai
 He says that Dalit society is the most important part of our development
 isliye unki soch unhen mubarak hamaare netaa naa sirf daliton ke ghar khaanaa khaaenge balki hamaare netaa unke rasoi main jaakar khaanaa bhi banaaenge
 Swati Singh had come in such a discussion that Swati Singh is a minister in the Yogi government
 2016 main swati singh tab charchaa main ai thi jab apane pati dayashankar singh ke bigade bol par tatkaaleen basapa netaa nasimuddin siddiki ke dwaara vivaadit bayaan ke khilaaf unhone morcha khol diya tha
 The nature of a movement against BSP was found and then Swati Singh was also discussed
 bijepi ne isi ke baad hi swati singh ko party ke mahila morcha kaa pradesh adhyaksh banaaya
 In the 2017 assembly elections, when BJP gave a ticket, Swati Singh won the election and became an MLA

 Interestingly, in the election, there has been a controversy in the BJP itself to make PM Narendra Modi the face in front of Nitish Kumar
 is babat kendriya mantri anant kumaar ke bayaan kaa susheel modi ne khandan kiya he
 Sumo said that the promotion of Modi vs Nitish is misleading
 gauratlab he ki mangalvaar subahabihar chunaav prabharianant kumaar ne kaha ki bijepi bihar main bhi pradhanmantri narendra modi ke chehre ke bharose chunaav ladegi
 This means there will be a political fight between Nitish versus Narendra Modi in Bihar
 lekin din chadhate-chadhate pradesh ke purv upmukhyamantri or bijepi netaa susheel modi ne kumaar ke bayaan kaa khandan kar diya
 Sushil Modi said that the Chief Minister in Bihar will be from BJP, but there is no official seal on who will be the CM or whose face will be in the elections
 yah puraa vakya is myne main bhi khaas he ki jis samay anant kumaar 'nitish banaam modi' vaala tir chalaa rahe the, us vakt susheel modi bhi unke saath the, lekin tabhi sumo ne is ore koi tippanee nahin kii thi
 In such a situation, the question also arises that what happened during the last day, that 'chhoti Modi' took care of his quiver
 duusari ore, is puure maamle membijapi kii majaburico bhaanpakar vipaksh ne ise mudda bananaa shuru kar diya he
 The JDU-RJD alliance has already stamped the name of Nitish Kumar
 kejariwal kii tarj par nitish pehle hi apane chehre ko sabase pehle aage rakhkar bhunaa rahe hai
 In July, the decision will be taken by BJP leader Sushil Modi, refuting the statement of Anant Kumar, and also said that the party will take a decision on the CM candidate or something in July after the Legislative Council elections
 haalanki, ise bijepi kii majaburi kahen yaa phir party or gathbandhan main kalah par lagaam lagane kii koshish, saaf jaahir he kibijepike paas philvakt siem pad ke liye koi damdaar cheharaa nahin he
 In such a situation, the statement of Anant Kumar and the refutation of Sushil Modi on it has also warmed the internal politics of the BJP
 lalu prasad ne bataaya tha nirvanshyah bhi mahaj sanyog he ki bijepi main yah puraa masalaa aise samay main aayaa he jab somvaar ko hi kaaryakarta sammelan ke dauraan argedy pramukh lalu prasad ne bijepi ko nirvansh qaraar diya tha
 Lalu had clearly stated that the BJP has become dynastic and no longer has any face left that can stand in front of Nitish
 haalanki, vanshaheen ke mudde par susheel modi ne lalu prasad ko ko gheraa or kaha ki lalu ke liesattahi vansh or vansh hi satta he
 According to Sushil Modi, after the use of Jitan Ram Manjhi, dynasty has become stronger for Lalu Prasad, while BJP always prepares its future generations

 'ajtak' se khaas baatcheet main amit shah ne kaha ki PMC bank main jo kuch hua uski jaanch chal rahi he, or graahakon ko puraa paisa waapas kiya jayega
 In response to a question by the government active TV Today Network news director Rahul Kanwal about PMC Bank, the Home Minister said that PMC Bank has 80 percent depositors up to Rs 1 lakh
 jinke paise dipositor insurance skim act ke tahat waapas kiye jaaenge
 At the same time, more than 20 per cent of the depositors are more than Rs 1 lakh, the assets of the embezzlement accused have been seized by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to return their money
 isliye piemasi bank ke graahakon ko paise lautaane main kisi tarah tarah kii koi dikkat nahin aegi
 He said that under the legal process, people will get money in one to two months
 amit shah ne kaha ki jaise hi piemasi bank kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 The investigation was handed over to the Enforcement Directorate by the government

 The JDU has once again reacted to the political fragrance of the BJP and JDU alliance in Bihar
 jediu ke pravaktaa kasee tyaagi se sari atakalon par viraam lagaate hue saaf saaf kaha ki centre kii sarkaar ko hamaara baahar se samarthan he or aage bhi ye jari rahegaa
 He said that Amit Shah had told Nitish Kumar that we have a majority but we want all the constituent parties of NDA to be given a chance in the Modi government
 unhone kaha ki hamaari taraf se nato kisi naam ko bheja gaya tha or na hi kisi naam par charchaa kii gai thi lekin kai jagahon aisi charchaaen kii ja raheen thi ki jediu kii taraf se naam bheje gaye the
 The JDU spokesperson said that these Saafi rumors are false
 bataate chalem ki isse pehle nitish kumaar ne bhi bijepi jediu ke bich tanaav par apni safai pesh kii thi
 In the press conference, KC Tyagi stated that in the general elections, Nitish Kumar held 171 meetings for Narendra Modi and it was done only as a constituent of the alliance
 kasee tyaagi ne bataaya ki bihar main bhi aisa hi formula apanaaya gaya he
 We have taken care of everyone according to the number of mlas
 kasee tyaagi ke mutabikshapath grahan samaaroh ke din bhi amit shah ji ne phone kiya tha or shaamil hone ke liye kaha tha
 Earlier on Saturday, Nitish Kumar also made it clear that he will be together even further
 chaahe mantri bane yaa na bane
 He said that it is wrong to raise questions about the relationship between BJP and JDU
 nitish kumaar ne bataaya tha ki sankethik pratinidhitiv ke aadhaar par ek mantri ko shaamil kiye jane kaa ofer tha lekin isaki koi jarurat nahin thi
 The public has given them the order to run the government, so there is no need of allies in this gauratlab he ki kuch din pehle nitish kumaar ne jab kendriya mantri giriraaj singh ke bayaan par tippanee karte hue kaha tha ki vah surkhiyon ke liye kuch bhi bol dete hai
 After this it was speculated that day-to-day relations between the BJP-JDU have started deteriorating
 us unhone (nitish Kumar) kaha tha ki aise log jo gaiyr-jaruri tippanee karne vaale logon kaa koi dharm nahin hota he
 BJP President and the country's Home Minister Amit Shah reacted strongly after Giriraj Singh's statement
 unhone giriraaj singh ko is tarah ke bayaan dobaaraa na dene kii hidaayat bhi di thi

 phir himalay kaa to kahana hi kya? purv or apaar samudr - mahodadhi or ratnavkar - donon ko donon bhujaaon se thahata hua himalay 'prithvi kaa maandand' kaha jaay to galat kyon he? kalidas ne aisa hi kaha tha
 This chain which is lying far in its foot country, people call it 'shivalik' series
 'shivalik' kaa kya arth he? 'shivalak' yaa shiv ke jatajut kaa nichalaa hissaa to nahin he? lagata to aisa hi he
 Shiva's pottery can be so dry, dry and hard
 vaise, alaknanda kaa strot yahan se kaaphi duuri par hai, lekin shiv kaa alak to dur-dur tak chhitaraya hi rahata hoga
 By looking at the entire Himalayas, the idol of Samadhisya Mahadev must have become clear in one's mind
 usee samadhisya mahodav ke alak-jaal ke nichle hisse kaa pratinidhitiv yah giri shrinkhalaa kar rahi hogi
 Somewhere the unknown name-gotra tree-tree and tree-tree are seen standing, but there is no greenery
 doob tak suukh gai he
 a bloodstained sandbar expressing power under black-black rocks and intermittent dryness
 ras kahan he? ye jo thingne-se lekin shandaar darkhtat garmi bhi bhayankar maar kha-khaakar or bhukh-pyaas kii nirantar chot sah-sahakar bhi ji rahe hai, inhen kya kahoon? sirf ji hi nahin rahe hai, hans bhi rahe hai
 Are you sad? Or are you cool? Sometimes people who look unconscious from above have deep roots
 ye bhi pashaan kii chaati fadkar na jane kis atal gahvar se apana bhogy khinch laate hai
 Smiling on the dry monotonous hills of Shivalik, these trees are dualityless, almighty
 main kisi kaa naam nahin jaanata, kuch nahin jaanata, sheel nahin jaanata, par lagata he, ye jaise mujhe anadi kaal se jaanate hai
 There is a very small tree in them, the leaves are also wide, they are big
 phulon se to aisa ladaa hai ki kuch puuchhie nahin
 It is amazing muskarata jaan padataa he
 Seems to ask, don't you even recognize me? i know, i definitely do
 lagata he, bahut baar dekh chukaa hoon
 i recognize the companions of the desolate, i recognize you well
 naam bhul rahaa hoon
 i go often rup dekhakar praayah pahchaan jaataa hoon, naam nahin yaad aata
 But the name is such that until the form is already present, the identity of the form remains incomplete
 bhartiya panditon kaa saikadon baar kaa kachara-nichoda prashn saamne aa gaya, rup mukhya he yaa naam? naam bada he yaa rup? pad pehle he yaa padaarth? padaarth saamne he, pad nahin sujh rahaa he
 The mind became distraught, peeping into the corners of distant past with wings of memories spread
 sochataa hoon, isamen vyakul hone kii kya baat he? naam se kya rakhaa he - hwatus dir in e nem
 Hundreds can be given if name is required
 susmita, girikanta, vanaprabha, shubhrakiritini, madoddhata, vijitatpa, alakabtansa, bahut-se naam hai
 Or may also be given the masculine-expressive names - Akutobhaya, Girigaurava, Kutollas, Aparajitha, Dharti Dhakel, pahar-phod, Patalabhed
 par man nahin maanata
 The name is not large because it is a name
 vah isliye bada hota he ki use saamaajik sweekruti mili hoti he
 Roop person is Satyak, Naam Samaj Satyak
 naam us pad ko kehete hai jis par samaaj kii muhar lagi hoti he, aadhunik shikshit log jise 'soshal sanksen' kaha karte hai
 My mind is distraught for the name, accepted by the society, certified by history, the mind of the whole human race in the Ganges
 is girikut-bihari kaa naam kya he? man dur-dur tak ud rahaa he - desh main or kaal main
 
 
 Manorathanamagatinavidyate
 achaanak yaad aayaa - are, yah to kutj he
 Very familiar with Sanskrit literature, but disregarded by poets, this small magnificent tree is 'kootaj'
 'kutaj' kaha gaya hota to kadaachit zyada acha hota
 But regardless of its name, the world will undoubtedly be 'kootaj'
 girikut par utpann honevaale is vriksh ko 'kutaj' kehane main vishesh anand miltaa he
 However, it is kutj-kutj, Manohar Kusum is shaken by stalwarts, Ullamus lol Charusmit Kutj
 ji bhar aayaa
 When Kalidas employed Yaksha to pray for 'meghdha' on 'ashadhasya, the first day' Ramgiri, the fucking had to be content with offering fresh kutz flowers - not Champak, not Bakul, not Neelotpal, not Mallika, not Arvind - Fakat Kutz flowers yah or baat he ki aaj asadha kaa nahin, july kaa pehla din he
 But there is also a difference
 baar-baar man vishwaas karne ko utaaru ho jaataa he ki yaksha bahaanaa maatr he, kalidas hi kabhi 'shapenastansgamitamahima' hokar ramagiri pahunche the, apane hi haathon is kutj pushp kaa ardhy dekar unhone megh kii abhyarthna kii thi
 Like this untouched mountain range of Shivalik, no other flowers would have been found at Ramgiri at that time
 kutj ne unke santapt chitt ko sahaara diya tha - badbhaagi phool he yah
 Blessed are you kutj, you are 'fellow of the thick' uttar kii ore sir uthaakar dekhtaa hoon, sudur tak unchi kaali parvat-shrinkhalaa chhaayi hui he or ekaadh safed badal ke bachche usase lipte khel rahe hai
 Should i also offer these flowers to them? But for what? But what is worse? These beautiful flowers of kutz are not so bad
 jo kalidas ke kaam aayaa ho use zyada izzat milani chahie
 Milli is less
 par izzat to naseeb kii baat he
 i remember Rahim with great respect
 dariyadil aadmi the, paaya so lutaaya
 But in the world that means meaning, the juice sucks, peels and throws the kernels
 suna he, ras chus lene ke baad rahim ko bhi phenk diya gaya tha
 One emperor called with reverence, the other threw up
 hua hi karata he
 This does not reduce the value of Rahim
 unki fakkadana masteen kahin gai nahin
 There were good good grandsons
 lekin bade logon par bhi kabhi-kabhi aisi vitrushna savaar hoti he ki galati kar baithte hai
 The mind must have been spoiled, it would have been derailed by the disinterested and indecent kind of people - in such a situation, he also gave a bite to the middle-aged kutz
 jhunjhalaae the, kah diya:ye rahim kab birch kanh, jinakar chhaanh gambheer,bagan bich-bich dekhiyat, senhud kutj kareer
 Goya kutaj adna-sa 'birch'
 'chhaanh' hi kya badi baat he, phool kya kuch bhi nahin? chaaya ke liye na sahi, phool ke liye to kuch sammaan hona chahie
 But sometimes the 'mood' of poets also gets spoiled
 ve bhi galat-bayani ke shikaar ho jaaya karte hai
 Then what is the meaning of girikoot-bihari kutz from gardens? Kutaj means one who is born from a kut
 'kut' ghade ko bhi kehete hai, ghar ko bhi kehete hai
 Kut means aristocratic Agastya Muni is also known as 'kutj'
 ghade se to kya utpann hue honge
 Anything else will happen
 sanskrit main 'kutaharika' or 'kutkarika' daasi ko kehete hai
 Why say The words 'kutiya' or 'cottage' are also probably associated with this word
 kya
 Does this word mean at home? The maid working at home can be called Kutkarika and Kutharika
 ek jaraa galat dhang kii daasi 'kutni' bhi kahi jaati he
 In Sanskrit, to make his mistakes a bit more vocal, he has been called 'kuttani'
 agastya muni bhi naradji kii tarah daasi ke putr the kya? ghade main paidaa hone kaa to koi tuk nahin he, na muni kutj ke silsile main, na phool kutj ke
 Flowers are definitely in flower pot, but kutj is a tourist of the forest
 use ghade yaa gamale se kya lenaa-dena? shabd vicharottejak avashya he
 Where did you come from? i doubt whether it is a word of Aryan languages or not
 ek bhashashasthri kisi sanskrit shabd ko ek se adhik rup main prachlit pate the to turant uski kuleenata par shaq kar baithte the
 The form ‘kutj’ is also found in Sanskrit and also ‘kutcha’
 milane ko to 'kutj' bhi mil jaataa he
 So which caste is this word from? The Aryans do not know the caste
 silvaan tevi kah gaye hai ki sanskrit bhashaa main phulon, vrikshon or kheti bagwani ke adhikansh shabdh aagney bhashaa-parivaar ke hai
 Is this also there? There was a time when the continents of Australia and Asia were mixed, then there was a terrible natural eruption and the two separated
 unnisvin shatabdi ke bhashaa-vigyaani panditon ko yah dekhakar aashcharya hua ki austrailia ke sudur jangalon main basii jatiyon kii bhashaa asia main basii hui kuch jatiyon kii bhashaa se sambhddha he
 Many castes of India speak the language which includes Santhal, Munda etc
 shuru-shuru main is bhashaa kaa naam austro-aciatic diya gaya tha
 Due to being the language of the South East or Agnogna, it has also been called the Agnayya family
 ab ham log bhartiya janata ke varg-vishesh ko dhyaan main rakhkar or puraane sahitya kaa samaran karke ise kol-parivaar kii bhashaa kehane lage hai
 Pundits have stated that many words of Sanskrit language, which have now become an indescribable part of Indian culture, belong to this category of language
 camel, kudmal, kambu, kambal, tambul aadi shabd aise hi bataae jate hai
 The names of trees, plants, farming tools and tools are also similar
 'kutj' bhi ho to kya aashcharya? sanskrit bhashaa ne shabdon ke sangrah main kabhi chhot nahin maani
 Do not know how many words of each race have become their own
 pandit log uski chaan-been karke hairaan hote hai
 Sanskrit is the universal language
 yah jo mere saamne kutj kaa laharaata paudha khadaa he vah naam or rup donon main apni aparaajey jeevani-shakti kii ghoshnaa kar rahaa he
 That is why it is so attractive
 naam he ki hajaaron varsh se jeeta chalaa aa rahaa he
 How many names have come and gone
 duniya unako bhul gai, ve duniya ko bhul gaye
 But it is misleading that in Sanskrit's continuous spherical word zodiac, which is sitting idle
 or rup kii to baat hi kya he
 Balihari is this intoxicating beauty
 chaaron ore kupit yamraj ke darun nirishwaas ke samaan dadhakati lu main yah haraa he or bharaa bhi he, durjan ke chitt se bhi adhik kathor pashaan kii kaara main ruddha agyaat jalstrot se barabas ras khinchakar saras bana hua he or murkh ke mastishk se bhi adhik suune giri kantar main bhi aisa mast bana he ki irshyaa hoti he
 What a difficult biographical power
 praan hi praan ko pulakit karata he, jeevani-shakti hi jeevani shakti ko prerana detii he
 The distant mountain is the snowy peaks of the Himalayas, somewhere where Lord Mahadev will be seated in a tomb, below is a plain of flat rocky ground, sometimes the mountain ranges are looking for a way forward - in the middle it is a rugged rocky rock - dry , Monotonous, harsh
 yaheen asana markar baithe hai mere chirparichit dost kutj
 Once shaking his shrubby idol, Samadhinistha presents the gift of Pushpastastabaka to Mahadev and once by pressing down his infernal piercing roots, he tells Girinandini Sarutas a hint of where the source of the juice is
 jeena chaahate ho? kathor pashaan ko bhedakar, pataal kii chaati chirakar apana bhogy sangrah karo, vayumandal ko chuskar, jhanjha-tufaan ko ragadkar, apana prapya vasuul lo, akaash ko chumkar, avkaash kii lahari main jhumkar, ullas khinch lo
 This is the sermon of Kutaj: Bhitva pashanpitharan chitvar prabhanjinin vyathampitva patalpaniyam kutjashumbarte nabh:
 durant jivan shakti he
 It is difficult teaching
 jeena bhi ek kala he
 But not only art, it is austerity
 jeeyo to praan dhaal do jindagi main, man dhaal do jivan ras ke upkarnon main
 Okay
 lekin kyon ? kya jeene ke liye jeena hi badi baat he? sara sansar apane matlab ke liye hi to ji rahaa he
 Yajnavalkya was a very great brahmanic sage
 unhone apni patni ko vicitra bhav se samajhane kii koshish kii ki sab kuch swaarth ke liye he
 For a son the son is not dear, for the wife the wife is not dear - all are dear to their meaning - 'atmanastu kamay sarvya bhavanti
 ' vicitra nahin he yah tark? sansar main jahaan kahin prem he, sab matlab ke liye
 It is heard that thinkers like Hobbes and Helvetius of the West have said the same thing
 sun ke hairaani hoti he
 There is no renunciation in the world, no love, no altruism, no altruism - only great selfishness
 bheetar kii jijeevishaa - jite rahane kii prachand ichha - hi agar badi baat ho to phir yah sari badi-badi boliyaan, jinke bal par dal banaae jate hai, shatrumardan kaa abhinay kiya jaataa he, deshoddhar kaa naaraa lagaaya jaataa he, sahitya or kala kii mahima gaai jaati he, jhooth hai
 Through this, some one proves his great selfishness
 lekin antartar se koi kah rahaa he, aisa sochna galat dhang se sochna he
 There is definitely something greater than selfishness, there is a need of some or the other power that is stronger than life
 kya he?yajyavlky ne jo baat dhakka maar dhang se kah di thi vah antim nahin thi
 They wanted to make the meaning of 'atman -' something greater
 vyakti kaa 'aatma' keval vyakti tak simit nahin he, vah vyapak he
 Everyone in you and everyone in you - until such a collective wisdom does not come, you do not even enjoy complete happiness
 apane-aapako dalit draksha kii bhanti nichodkar jab tak 'sarv' ke liye nichhaavar nahin kar diya jaataa tab tak 'swaarth' khand satya he, vah moh ko badhaava detaa he, trishna ko utpann karata he or manushya ko dayaneey-kripan-bana detaa he
 Whose temperament has been affected by carpal dosha, his eyesight dissolves
 vah spasht nahin dekh paata
 He does not even understand selfishness; Paramartha is far away
 kutj kya keval ji rahaa he? vah duusare ke dwaar par bheekh maangane nahin jaataa, koi nikat aa gaya to bhay ke maare adhamra nahin ho jaataa, niti or dharm kaa upadesh nahin detaa phirata, apni unnati ke liye afasaron kaa juuta nahin chatata phirata, dusron ko avamaanit karne ke liye grahon kii khushaamad nahin karata, atmonnati ke hetu neelam nahin dhaaran karata, anguthiyon kii ladi nahin pahentaa, daant nahin niporata, baglein nahin jhaankata
 Live and live gracefully - for what purpose, for what purpose? nobody knows
 magar kuch badi baat he
 It is beyond the scope of selfishness
 bhishma pitamah kii bhanti avadhoot kii bhashaa main kah rahaa he : 'chaahe sukh ho yaa dukh, priy ho yaa apriy, jo mil jaay use shaan ke saath, hriday se bilkul aparajit hokar, sollas grahan karo
 Do not give up
 'sukhan vaa yadi vaa dukhan priyan vaa yadi vapriyam
 Received Received (shantiparv, 25 / 26)hridayenaparajitah
 What a huge heart that will not be distracted by happiness, sadness, beloved, unpleasant
 kutj ko dekhakar romaanch ho aata he
 Where did you get this incredible attitude, undefeated nature, uninterrupted life-vision
 jo samajhataa he ki vah dusron kaa upkaar kar rahaa he vah abodh he, jo samajhataa he ki duusare uskaa apkaar kar rahe hai vah bhi buddhiheen he
 Who treats whom, who rejects whom? Man is living, living only, not according to his will, according to the plan of the historian
 kisi ko usase sukh mil jaay, bahut acchhee baat he, nahin mil sakaa, koi baat nahin, parantu use abhimaan nahin hona chahie
 If the pride to bring happiness is wrong, then the pride to cause pain is absolutely wrong
 dukh or sukh to man ke vikalp hai
 Happy is one whose mind is subdued, unhappy is one whose mind is dependent
 paravash hone kaa arth he khushaamad karnaa, daant niporna, chatukaarita, haan-hajuri
 The one whose mind is not in his control, the other man's mind quells, creates false pretenses to hide himself, sets a trap to trap others
 kutj in sab mithyaacharon se mukt he
 She is a bride
 vah vairaagi he
 Like Raja Janak, being in the world, having enjoyed all the pleasures, is also free from them
 janak kii hi bhanti vah ghoshnaa karata he: ''main swaarth ke liye apane man ko sadaa duusare ke man main ghusaata nahin phirata, isliye main man ko jeet sakaa hoon use vash main kar sakaa hoon' :nahamatmarthmicchaami manonityam manontare
 Tasmati vashishtha vishvatha always relented
 kutj apane man par sawari karata he, man ko apane par savaar nahin hone detaa
 Happy friend, you are blessed

 ek bayaan main nasa ne kaha ki is paratdaar parvat kaa ek cretar main hona shodhakartaaon ke liye ek chunauteepurn sawaal bana hua he
 "we are working to solve the mystery of Mount Sharp," said John Grootzinger, project scientist at Curiosity and professor at the California Institute of Technology

 Kundalika is the only river in the country where white water rafting can be enjoyed throughout the year
 mumbai or pune se lagbhag 122 kilometre kii duuri par raigarh jile ke kolad main kundalika nadi he
 The initial point of water rafting is near Ravalje village
 water rafting do ghante main 12 kilometre puraa karnaa padataa he
 120 tourists do water rafting here every day
 kundalika river main water rafting sabase surakshit he or 14 saal kaa kishor bhi water rafting nidar hokar kar saktaa he
 There is Bhira Dam in Kolad where hydroelectric plant is
 isi dam se rojaanaa subah pani choda jaataa he
 Water rafting is done in this water
 yah pani arab sagar ke roha creek main chalaa jaataa he
 Tourists will have to stay for a day at the Nature Trails Resort of Sterling Holidays to experience water rafting
 isaki vajah yah he ki water rafting subah saadhe aath baje se shuru hota he
 Nature Trails Resort is the only place to change clothes and rest a little after the water rafting starts at the starting point and the last floor
 haalanki, water rafting ke liye 650 se 1200 rupe prati vyakti fees he
 But with other facilities in the package of the resort is also cheaper
 monsoon main to water rafting kaa apana hi majaa he
 It is also very exciting before and after monsoon
 yahaan water rafting 2006 main shuru kiya gaya or ab tak lagbhag 40 hajaar paryatakon ne water rafting kii he
 Foreign tourists also come for water rafting
 kundalika river main river rafting mercury himalayan exploration (emechai) kii dekharekh main hoti he
 River rafting is also done by MHE in other areas of the country
 yahaan prashikshit instractor rishikesh se bhi laae jate hai
 There are more than 12 rubber tires on which tourists do water rafting
 emechai kii taraf se harek sadsy ko life jacket, helmet or pedal die jate hai or unhen water rafting ke tareeke bhi bataae jate hai
 Instructor Dharamvir is a resident of Rishikesh who lives in Kundalika for six months and later goes to Rishikesh and Ladakh to work as an instructor
 dharamvir ke mutabik kundalika river main repids ke alag-alag naam hai
 They also mention dangerous rapids with the name
 river rafting kii shuruyaat good morning buddha se hoti he
 After this, the rapids gradually become fast and exciting
 isamen mahatvapurn wave repids hai jaise bush on band rapid or morning hedek rapid
 Morning Haddock Rapid is followed by Dangerous Rapid, John Carrie Rapid and Johnny Walker Rapid
 jon kairi ke paas rox zyada hai jisase pani main karant or oonchi lehren hoti hai
 Dharamvir says that no accident has happened in this water rafting so far
 pani ke andar koi khatarnaak jaanavar bhi nahin he
 Therefore, when reaching the last edge of rafting, the rafters are stripped of water wearing a life jacket just one kilometer before that
 log tairne kaa anand lete hai
 Even if no one knows how to swim, they are left to enjoy the water
 jo jacket pahanaaya jaataa he use pahane rahane se koi nahin duubataa he
 People are told that if someone falls into the boat during rafting, how to catch it on the boat
 kundalika river main water rafting kaa majaa to ek baar jarur lenaa chahie

 Haripal Tyagi was 85 years old, but his association with art was not completely missed
 khaas baat yah ki pichley dinon hi unka janmdin beetaa tha
 Haripal Tyagi was born on April 20, 1934 in village Mahuva in Bijnor district
 pita kaa naam sher singh tyaagi tathaa mata kaa naam dayavati devi tha
 In 2014, when he was eighty years old, the writer Bhola Nath Tyagi had revealed many things about the life and childhood of Haripal Tyagi
 unhone likhaa tha mahuwa gaanv ke naam main ek nashili mahak he
 The same smell is also in the life of the people of the village
 chota kisaan parivaar, ghar main garibi, or usase bhi kahin zyada kanjusee thi
 This yearning created a deep urge for things in Haripal's mind
 isane chizon ko sahaj dhang se paane main jo ras he, usase kahin zyada ras ghol diya
 Haripal Tyagi's tau's son Ravindranath Tyagi was a few years ahead in studies
 kamare main teen tasviren thim- swami dayanand, gramophone or taala
 Seeing them, Haripal Tyagi used to be ardent in the mind that if he gets color from somewhere, he too should add color to his pictures

 ' tisare din, kamalabai munshiram ke saath gaadi main baithkar chali gai
 In 1948, when communal riots broke out in the village, Haripal Tyagi's father also suffered serious injuries

 There he bought four buffaloes and started the business of selling milk

 Haripal Tyagi received one rupee for drawing for a magazine in the 50s

 He started working as a cartoonist in a newspaper
 saal 2013 main lalit kala academy main jab unke chitron kii pradarshnee lagi, jiskaa udghaatan ashok vaajapeyi ne kiya tha
 Then in conversation with Mahesh Darpan, he had said, "my first exhibition was held at Sridharani Gallery New Delhi
 iskaa udghaatan 13 farvari, 1969 ko mohan rakesh ne kiya tha
 But the painting had started long before that

 haripal tyaagi ke vyaktitv kaa khaas pahalu unki inasaaniyat or sahitya kii gahari ruchi or samaj thi
 He was not only a celebrated painter, but also a vigilant poet, satirist and storyteller
 aatmakatha ke rup main haripal tyaagi ne 'mahanagar kii adhuri ibaarat' sheershak se pathakon ko chamatkrit kiya
 In the story 'khushi', 'dining table' and poetry 'hoon toh' and 'passing day', creativity of Tyagi is made by seeing
 unki kavitaayen unke chitron ke kareeb thim or ebstrect hoti thim
 He wrote a novel 'nanku Ka Pajama'
 bal sahitya kii kitaaben 'subah kaa gayak', 'chamkila moti', 'spatakis kaa roopantaran' or 'amarfal' naam se chhapi thim, to aatmakatha kaa naam tha 'adhuri ibaarat'
 He also had a keen grip on satire

 In his book Mahapurusha, published by Rajpal and Sons, he wrote, "the satirical form of literature has been taken lightly for a long time
" iske liye adhik jimmedaar ve vyangy-lekhak hai jo ise halkaa-phulka maanakar likhte rahe
 Leave aside the matter of language, interested in the contradictions of life and various societies around you, and peep into the hearts, how subtly the language picked up from the written books and taken out of them Rob might shed some time with 'creativity', but how many days will someone run the rainbow of stale Kadhi? It would be good to earn your own bread and also make others aware of its taste and smell

 In Hindi literature, from poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan to Kamleshwar, Mohan Rakesh, Rajendra Yadav, Namvar Singh, Manu Bhandari, Himanshu Joshi and Manglesh Dabral, his paintings would have been taken care of

 That is why there was a deep mourning in the literature on his death

 But due to his love of literature, he kept away from the world of art and tips to succeed in it

 He was also a rare critic of art

 His satire was also very sharp with his prose and poems

 It is said that the fortunate and auspicious results of Akshaya Tritiya never fail

 It is believed that Mata Lakshmi always stays at home by buying gold on this day

 In such a situation, it is very important to be aware of the customer
 unhen yah pataa hona chahie ki ve jo sona kharid rahe hai wo asli he yaa nakli

 But Baghdadi, lost by repeated defeats, takes the life of its terrorists
 yadi syria-iraq kii fouj ke aage bagdadi ke aatanki tik nahin pate or wo maidan chhodkar bhaagate hai, to vah unhen bahut badi sajaa detaa he
 Such a punishment that burns them in fire and then kills them alive
 mosul main yahi hua, jahaan bagdadi ne 20 aatankiyon ko maar daalaa
 These include four Indians
 bagdadi apane aatank ke raste kaa pathar maanata he, unako maar daalata he
 Those who refuse to consider him as Khalifa also kill him
 vah un aatankiyon ko bhi aise hi maar daalata he, jo uske liye ladate hai, lekin bich main waapas lautnaa chaahate hai
 He is not familiar with the business of terror, even for those terrorists who give their lives for that devil
 usne bees aatankiyon ko haivaaniyat kii had tak jaakar maar daalaa
 Four Indians are expected to be among the twenty terrorists killed by Baghdadi
 khufia agenciyon ko khabar mili he ki ye aatanki mosul main bagdadi ke liye lard rahe the
 Baghdadi bases in Syria and Iraq have been attacked by Russia, America and European countries
 kai jagahon par uske tel ke kuon se lekar hathiyaaron ke uske jakhire bhasma ho chuke hai
 He is so devastated that he has reduced the salary of his terrorists
 maut dekh kaanp aatankiyon kaa kalejasiria or iraq ke baad libya main usne apana garh bananaa chaha lekin america ne vahaan uski jameen taiyaar hone se pehle hi ukhaad diya he
 That is why, in order to save his sinful world, he sent terrorists to compete with the missiles of Western countries
 lekin aasmaan se barasati maut ko dekhakar aatankiyon kaa kalejaa kaanp gaya
 He came back to ISIS camp
 lekin yahaan unhen or bhi buree maut mili
 Baghdadi's cross-border reports of the Hadengriya Ministry suggest that 6 out of the 23 Indian youth fighting for Baghdadi have died
 bagdadi ke aatanki bane wo ladke bemaut maare gaye
 This report and the latest story of the barbarity of Baghdadi indicate how it has crossed all limits of humility
 vahaan sabase bura haal to un hindustani yuvakon kaa hota he, jo bagdadi ke aatanki brigade main shaamil hone ke liye jate hai
 Hindustani terrorists are considered second-rate
 dharm ke naam par bargalaata he bagdadibeete 2 saalon main iesas ne iraq main lagbhag 19 hajaar logon kii hatya kii he

 The religion in whose name they are called to fight
 usee dharm ko bhuulakar syria jate hi unke saath nasl or sampradaay ke aadhaar par bhedbhaav kiya jaataa he
 Especially with the youth of India, Bangladesh and Pakistan
 bhartiya upmahadweep ke yuvaaon se bhedbhaavbhartiya grahamantralay ko intelligence share se mili jaankaree bataati he ki bharat, bangladesh or pakistan se gaye yuvaaon ko nichle darje kaa kaam miltaa he
 Arab and Syrian terrorists hold senior positions
 unhen behatar hathiyaar, surakshit kaam or badhiya vetan miltaa he
 Terrorists of Indian subcontinent and African origin treat sheep like goats
 ladaai ke maidan main unhen aage rakhaa jaataa he
 So that the death of Arab terrorists is reduced
 dhokhe se yuvaaon ko banaaya aatmghaateein yuvaaon ko aatmghaatee hamale ke liye dhokhe se istemaal kiya jaataa he
 They are told to go to a particular place and dial a special number from their mobile by giving them ammo filled car
 phir unhen target bataa diya jayega
 There, he can return to the vehicle by driving the fidayeen
 lekin jaise hi train aatanki kol karte hai
 The ammo kept in the car is detonated and blasted
 yuvaaon ko jinn kaa hawala dekar daraaya jaataa he
 The two girls created poster girlapril in 2014, Samara Kesinovich and Sabina Selimovich of Austria were admitted to ISIS
 bagdadi ne inhenposter garlbana diya gaya
 Sabina died after being shot
 lekin samaara ne atyaacharon se tang aakar rakka se bhaagane kii koshish kii to aatankiyon ne use itnaa peeta ki uski maut ho gai
 Not only this, the photographs of these two were promoted by Baghdadi as sex slaves
 taaki ayyashi kaa laalach dekar yuvaaon ko joda ja sake
 17 Hindustanis are fighting in Syria; It has come to the exclusive knowledge that 17 Hindustani who became terrorists of Baghdadi are still in Syria
 khufia agenciyon ko lagata he ki jin bees aatankiyon kobagdadine maaraa he, unamem chaar hindustani bhi the
 Although the number of young people wandering from India is small, the way Baghdadi treats them is enough to open everyone's eyes

 - Bhayyaji Joshi, Sarkaryavah - RSS (@rssorg) October 18, 2019 Bhaiyyaji Joshi said these things while answering the questions of journalists in Odisha on Friday
 ve sangh kii teen divasiy akhil bhartiya kaaryakarini kii baithak ke antim din bhubaneshwar main patrakaron se baatcheet kar rahe the
 On the uniform code of conduct, he said that this demand is very old
 samvidhannirmaan ke samay hi iskaa faisla ho janaa chahie tha
 It is in everyone's interest and in any country there should be a uniform law for its citizens
 bhairav laal das kii kitaab ‘champaran main gandhi kii srijanayatra’ gandhi ke champaran lan andolan kii graphical detail detii he
 Much has been read about the Champaran movement
 lekin is kitaab main kai aisi baaten darj hai jo pehle kisi ne nahin bataayin
 In the book, you can read ball to ball reporting of that important movement about a hundred years ago, where you will know that the British did not forcibly cultivate indigo from the farmers in Champaran, but used to take dozens of such taxes, which makes them tremble
 
 hamen pataa nahin ki bharat main kabhi maa -baap ke marane par shaskaon ne janata se tex liya tha yaa nahin, lekin ye kitaab bataati he ki angrej aisi sthiti main ‘bapahi-putahi’ tex lete the
 Separate tax on buying a motor vehicle or elephant
 aise lut kii ek lambii fehrist he
 If modern history of Bihar was ever written, this book is an important reference book
 is kitaab main ham aise-aise paatro ko pate hai jo aamtaur par logon kii yaaddaasht main nahin hai-masalan ramanavami prasad, dharnidhar prasad, poornendu narayan sinha, ramadayalu sinha, hasan imam, saiyad ali imam, ramaraksha brahmacharee maharaj rameshwar singh ityadi
 There is a long list of people who joined the Champaran movement to the fullest with Gandhi
 tatkaaleen bihar kii raajnneeti main or alag bihar rajya ke andolan main bhi kaaysthon or musalamaanon (khaskar vakeelon kii) kitni badi bhoomika thi, iskaa bhi ek andaaj is kitaab main miltaa he
 Gandhi was not just a political activist in Champaran, but he was also a social reformer, or rather a large part of his personality belonged to a social reformer
 dakshin africa kii hi tarah gandhi ne champaran main anubhav kar liya tha ki jab tak samaaj main vyapak sudhaar kaary nahin kiya jayega, logon main aatmavishvaas nahin aa paaegaa
 He started education, health, sanitation, mass food and campaign against untouchability in Champaran on a large scale
 lekin ye bihar ke samaaj kaa durbhaagya he ki unke vahaan se jane ke baad yaa to ve vidhyalay or samaaj sudhaar ke abhiyaan band ho gaye yaa aniyamittaaon kii bhent chadh gaye
 It is said that after taking inspiration from Gandhi's programs, many national schools opened in other districts of Bihar like Darbhanga, Bhagalpur and elsewhere but later either they were closed or stuck in the clutches of the land mafia
 aise skulon kii kitni sankhya he or unka kya haal he yah ek alag shodh or pustak-lekhan kaa vishay ho saktaa he
 This book has a vivid description of the feudal mood of the then Bihar - whose impression is still intact, reluctance to change, revenue, traffic system, history of indigo cultivation in India and its global context
 sabase badi baat ye ki do vyavasthaaon ke bich ek pul yaa sandhikarta ke rup main gandhi ke vyaktitv ko jis tarah dekha gaya he wo adbhut he
 Gandhi was also like this
 dakshin africa main unka jo kaam tha wo isi tarah kaa tha
 The truth and non-violence weapon he had invented was not based on hatred of others but spoke of his rights and love
 ramchandra guha jinhone gandhi bifor india (hindi anuwaad- gandhi bharat se pehle: shuruaati jivan or raajnneetik safar) likhi he vahaan bhi gandhi isi bhoomika main najar aate hai
 Although one of the interpreters has mentioned at least 'sixteen roles' of Gandhi in South Africa, but notice that Gandhi was mainly a bridge between civilizations where he used truth and non-violence or satyagraha as pillars
 is kitaab main na sirf champaran andolan main bihar ke unke saathiyon kaa zikr he balki gujarat, maharashtra, urisa aadi praaton ke swayamsevakon kaa bhi zikr he
 Here, Gandhi's personality also gives a glimpse of the wonderful diplomatist, how he took the kind of work from which volunteers
 gandhi us andolan ke purna niyantrak ke rup main najar aate hai jahaan unhone tatkaaleen congress yaa desh ke anya netaaon ko ek seemaa se zyada vahaan hastkshep nahin karne diya! kehete hai ki koi badi rachana kai bhavi rachanaaon kii prishthbhumi hoti he
 Gandhi's life is an epic in itself, with Champaran being one of the important chapters
 lekin adhyay champaran us samay mahakavy ban jaataa he jab usamen se kai up-kathaayen nikalati hai or kai sambhaavnaaen bhi
 The author notes the association of 'pratap' Ganesh Shankar Vidyathi, Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar with Champaran, the plight of the schools established by Gandhi, the use of the word 'mahatma' by Rajkumar Shukla for the first time and the land abandoned by Neel's Kothi
 Like, many such angles have been left at which separate writing can be done
 gauratlab he ki lekhak ko is kitaab ko likhane kii prerana tab mili thi jab ve kathi lipi par kaam kar rahe the or raaj kumaar shukla kii kathi lipi main likhi diary kaa devanagari main lipyantaran kar rahe the
 The value of the book has been kept high which makes it away from the general public
 iskaa paperbaque sanskaran aana chahie or saath hi yah online marketing cites par bhi uplabdh nahin he
 This book should have been written in detail on Bettiah Raj, which lacks
 pustak main tasveeron kii sankhya bhi apekshaakrit kam hai or unka aakaar chota rakhaa gaya he
 But the biggest thing is that there are so many references in this book that it is a painstaking task to read the references completely
 bhairav laal das ne saikadon pustakon or dastabejon ke biabaan se champaran rupi jis durlabh aushadhi ko nikaal kar logon ke saamne rakhaa he, wo stuty he

 The continuing political turmoil about Hanuman's caste and religion has intensified
 hanuman ko dalit, jat, chinis or musalmaan bataane par congress ne bhartiya janata party (BJP) par poster waar kiya he
 Posters have been posted on the streets of Patna, the capital of Bihar, in which the Congress said that first the BJP leaders called Hanuman a Dalit, then a Jat and then a Chinese, and now a BJP MLA has declared him a Muslim, which is a bigamy
 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main jo bhi vyakti bijepi ko vot degaa, wo bhi paap main bhagidaar hoga
 This poster reads - 'BJP leaders have done a great sin! After telling Dalits, Jats and Chinese, they told Lord Hanuman a Muslim
 bhaajapa ko vot dene waal honge paap ke bhagidaar
 In the poster, Hanuman Chalisa's footstep is also written - "inaccessible kaja jetay, sugam grace grace tumhare tate
" ram duaare tum rakhware, hot na ajna bin paisare
 'lord Ram with Hanuman in this poster, Congress President Rahul Gandhi, Congress leader E
 venkatesh raman, bihar congress ke purv sachiv siddharth kshatriya kii bhi tasviir lagi he
 This poster also shows a map of India, showing Rahul Gandhi folded in front of Hanuman
 isamen hanuman dwaara rahul gandhi ko aashirwad dete darshaya gaya he or kaha gaya he ki ab vahi bijepi ke netaaon ke ahankaar ko nasht karenge
 In this poster, mother Ganga is shown saying that the BJP leaders have used all the gods and goddesses to vote and Hanuman avenge this insult from the BJP leaders
 aapako bataa den ki rajasthan vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne hanuman ko dalit bataaya tha, jisko lekar jamkar congress samet kai vipakshi partiyon or sadhu-santon ne hamalaa bolaa tha
 At the same time, despite opposition from the opposition, there was a competition among BJP leaders to tell Hanuman's caste and religion
 kisi ne hanuman ko adivasee bataaya, to kisi ne musalmaan
 Who told what Hanuman was, after Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, BJP MLA Bukkal Nawab Nehuman was called Muslim
 iske alaava bijepi saansad hariom pandey ne hanuman ko brahman, bijepi saansad udit raaj ne adivasee, bijepi saansad kirti aaazaad ne chini, acharya nirbhay sagar maharaj ne jain or uttar pradesh ke mantri choudhary lakshmi narayan ne jat bataaya he

 When the party's national president Mulayam Singh Yadav and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav camp reached the Election Commission after taking their claims on the Samajwadi Party and the cycle, it was believed that the sp's name and election symbol would freeze and the Election Commission separated the two camps
 Will ask to contest elections with name and symbol
 yahi vajah he ki somvaar kii shaam jab ayog kii ore se akhilesh yadav ko hi samaajawaadee party kaa asli kartadharta qaraar diya gaya to sab hairaan rah gaye lekin ayog ke 40 se zyada pannon vaale faisle par najar daalen to saaf he ki akhilesh ko cycle kii sawari yun hi nahin mili he
 These are the 5 reasons why Mulayam was defeated by his own son in the commission's arena
 adhiveshan ko avaidh sabit nahin kar paae mulimmulaayam kheme kii daleel thi ki samaajawaadee party ke samvidhan ke mutabik uskaa adhyaksh hi party kaa adhiveshan bula saktaa he isliye mahasachiv ramgopal dwaara bulaayaa gaya adhiveshan avaidh he
 In such a situation, the decisions taken in that session are also illegal, but the Akhilesh camp argued that Mulayam himself never followed the sp's constitution
 ramgopal yadav or khud akhilesh yadav ko jis tarah party se nikaala gaya or phir waapas liya gaya wo katai samvidhan ke mutabik nahin tha
 Under the constitution, the system of convening the party's session at regular intervals was also not being followed
 5731 main se 4716 padaadhikari akhilesh samarthalakhilesh kheme kii ore se ramgopal yadav ne apane daavon ke samarthan main 228 main se 205 vidhayakon, 68 main se 56 vidhanparishad sadasyon, 24 main se 15 loksabhaa-rajyasabha saansadon, rashtriya kaaryakarini ke 46 main se 28 sadasyon or rashtriya adhiveshan main shaamil 4400 sadasyon ke halafname saunpe, mulaayam singh yadav ke kheme kii ore se aisa koi samarthak yaa uskaa koi halafanama pesh nahin hua
 Overall, 4716 out of 5731 supporters of the party were with the Akhilesh camp
 adhiveshan ko avaidh sabit nahin kar paae mulimmulaayam kheme kii ore se daleelein pesh karne ke liye 11 vakeelon kii team ayog main utari jabaki akhilesh kheme ne desh ke jane maane vakil kapil sibbal ko apane cese kii pairvi ke liye utaara
 The Mulayam camp continued to reject Ram Gopal's summoned session, but he had no answer to the question that when almost all the public representatives and officials of the party have accepted Akhilesh as the president, then why did Mulayam get the command and cycle mark? Mullayam Singh Yadav, who had been refusing to revolt in the party, argued that there was no rebellion or breakdown in the party because Ram Gopal Mulayam Singh Yadav was also made the guide in Yadav's session
 unhen party se nikaala nahin gaya tha isliye yahaan ye kahana ki party main yadav ke khilaaf koi baghawat he, thik nahin hoga
 Akhilesh Yadav himself did not fill any nomination papers to become national president in place of Mulayam
 lekin ramgopal kheme ne jis tarah akhilesh ke samarthan main 90 fisadi sadasyon ke halafname pesh kar diya usase mulaayam kheme kaa kalah na hone kaa tark kamjor pad gaya
 The mps-mlas were not found together
 In the Election Commission, the Mulayam camp was not ready to believe that there were any differences or rebellion in the party, whereas Kapil Sibal's clear argument from Ram Gopal Yadav was that the party has split into two camps
 And in a democracy, the group that has the most elected representatives has the right to the election symbol and the party
 ayog ke faisle ke baad bhi sibbal ne apni pratikriya dete hue kaha ki chunaav ayog ne kai najariyon se jaanch padtaal ke baad ye faisla sunaaya he
 While all the documents were kept by Akhilesh, the Mulayam camp ignored the instructions of the Election Commission, which showed that they had no documents to support their argument
 dilli kii ek adaalat ne kal mohalla assi film kii relies par roak laga di
 Reports said that the film was to release on 3 July

 If the dubbing is not completed, how will it be released? 'mohalla Assi' is a Hindi film based on the famous Hindi story writer Kashinath Singh's famous novel Kashi Ka Assi
 kishton main chapa yah upanyaas saahitiyik or saanskrithik halkon main charchaa kaa vishay ban gaya tha
 The dubbing of this film based on the same has not been completed yet, but on the basis of a leaked promo last month, people started reaching courts against it
 shikaayat? yahi ki yah banaras, hindu samskruti or devi-devataaon kii galat chhavi pesh kar rahi he
 The film will be shown to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well, saying, "people were coming to spoil the culture of Banaras, we made this film to warn them and now people are creating an atmosphere against it without even seeing it
" abhi to hamsensor boardbhi nahin gaye hai
 Once we are ready for release, we will also try to show this to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 hamen puraa vishwaas he ki ek baar agar unhone film dekh lee to iske vishay ko dekhte hue pakke taur par ise ve tex free karvaa denge
 Director Dwivedi also says that the film was made four years ago
 ise nae sire se sampadit bhi kiya jayega or abhi thodi dabing bhi baaki he
 It is unfortunate to stop filming before this
 sunne main aa rahaa he ki li promo ke baad film ko lekar bane maahaul se iske mukya abhinaytasani deolbhi nae sire se isamen ruchi lene lage hai

 After becoming the Home Minister, Amit Shah is in full form, there is a rumor to abolish article 370 and 35A in Kashmir, there is news from sources that the Central Government can also limit delimitation in Jammu and Kashmir
 jis rose amit shah ne grahamantri kaa kaam sambhala tha, usee rose unhone jammu kashmir ke rajyapal satyapal malik ke saath baithak kii thi, or isi baithak ne bataa diya tha ki nae navaniyukt grahamantri kii pehali chunauti mishan kashmir he
 It is now reported from sources that Home Minister Amit Shah is considering delimitation in Jammu and Kashmir
 parisemen ke liye ayog kaa gathan ho saktaa he
 BJP leaders in Jammu and Kashmir want that delimitation should be done soon
 jammu kashmir bijepi ke adhyaksh kavindra gupta kaa kahana he vah rajyapal ko likh chuke hai ki rajya main parisemen karaayaa jaae
 This will bring justice to the three regions of the state, Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh region
 baharhaal, ab is parisemen kii siyasat ko salike se samajhnaa hoga
 The Jammu and Kashmir Assembly has a total of 111 seats
 magar jammu kashmir main sirf 87 siton par hi chunaav hote hai
 According to Section 47 of the Constitution of Jammu Kashmir, 24 seats are kept vacant
 khaali kii gayi 24 siten paak adhikrut kashmir ke liye khaali chodi gayi thim
 According to experts, BJP will directly benefit from this math
 bijepi ko kaise hoga phaaydajammu kshetra main 37 vidhansabha siten hai
 In the 2014 assembly elections, BJP won 25 seats here
 jammu kshetra main bijepi kaa dabadabaa he
 If there is delimitation, then 24 seats lying vacant will join the Jammu region
 bijepi ko lagata he ki parisemen se use phayda hoga
 Now consider the next chapter in the politics of delimitation
 jammu kashmir main 1995 main parisemen kiya gaya tha
 According to the state constitution, Jammu and Kashmir was to be delimited after every 10 years
 magar tatkaaleen faruk abdulla sarkaar ne 2002 main is par 2026 tak ke liye roak laga di thi, or ab bijepi dobaaraa parisemen chaahati he
 Distressed to hear about gois plan to redraw assembly constituencies in J&K
 Forced delimitation is an obvious attempt to inflict another emotional partition of the state on communal lines
 Instead of allowing old wounds to heal, goi is inflicting pain on Kashmiris — Mehbooba Mufti (@mehboobamufti) June 4, 2019, but former Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti sees delimitation as dividing the state on communal basis
 unhone twit kiya, 'jammu-kashmir main vidhansabha kshetron ko phir se taiyaar karne kii bharat sarkaar kii yojana ke bare main sunakar pareshaan hum
 The needless delimitation is a clear attempt to incite another emotional division of the state on communal grounds

 kuch logon ke khilaaf anushaasanamak karrwai hui he or jo bhi party kaa anushaasan nahin maanegaa uske khilaaf karrwai hogi, yah sabhi party or santhaan main hota he
 AAP came up with a new model against traditional politics, but people have been disappointed with some developments
 yah prachaar zyada ho rahaa he
 Since we have come into the government, there is no acceptance of any kind of corruption in the government regarding transfer-posting, so there is a panic in the bureaucracy and also in the bjp-congress
 is par roak lagane se sabhi pareshaan hai
 But recently AAP issued a circular against the media, which has been banned by the Supreme Court
 circular main ek bhi shabd aisa nahin he jo pehle se kanoon main uplabdh nahin he
 We have just repeated that
 media kaa ek tabaka aaj modi or amit shah ke ishaare par aap kii chhavi kharaab karne kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 If we fight against corruption in judiciary, executive and if we do not fight against corruption prevailing in journalism, then this fight will be incomplete

 ' Hello Darling '
 prabhas ne apane ab tak ke sabhi 35 instagram post main apane tees lakh foloar ko isi tarah sambodhit kiya he
 He came to this photo and video-sharing platform only after the massive success of two Bahubali films, which made his image from a Telugu superstar to a composite India
 vaise, anya abhinaytaon ke vipareet soshal media prabhas ke liye bas unke kaam se judaa rahata he
 He blushes a bit, "i'm better than before
" '' ve ek paanch sitara hotel ke banquet haul main baithe hai, jahaan unke paanch angrakshakon ne baahar apni nazren gada rakhi hai
 He is busy promoting his latest film Saaho
 30 agast ko relies ho rahi acshan thriller saaho teen bhashaaon—hindi, tamil or telegu—main shoot kii gai he
 Shooting for an estimated budget of Rs 350 crore, the film lasted for two years
 yah prabhas kii pichhali film par lagaae samay se teen saal kam he
 Shobu Yarlagadda, one of the two producers of the films, praised the commitment of Prabhas, saying that without it Bahubali could not have been made into a film
 ve kehete hai, ''jab ve 32 saal ke the or apane kariyar ke sheersh par the tab ve hamaare saath aae or itnaa lanbaa samay diya
 This shows his passion for his work and his hunger to do something different from others
 '' 2002 main apni pehali film ke baad se 2015 main bahubali: da bigining or 2017 main bahubali: da kanklusen ke relies hone ke bich prabhas kii koi film theatre main nahin ai
 Says Yarlagadda, "after the first film, Bahubali's character was printed in everyone's mind and they did not want the perception of the audience to change
 ''ek ore jahaan bahubali mahatvakankshi project tha, jiskaa nirdesan jane-maane nirdeshak es
 s
 rajamouli ne kiya, vahiin, saaho puri tarah se prabhas ke kandhon par tiki he
 Of course, this star's shoulders can be very strong and wide, but given the scale with which the film is releasing — an estimated 4,500 simultaneous releases are reported, its producers UV Creations and t-series have given the actor Has played huge bets on the popularity of
 prabhas kehete hai, ''haa, mujh par dabaav he kyonki har koi mujhe bahubali ke rup main jaanata he
 The challenge, he said, was to find a bigger project that would help him capitalize on his widespread popularity in Hindi-speaking areas, especially after the second part of Bahubali was dubbed in Hindi
 510 karod rupye kii kamai ke saath bahubali 2 hindi main ab tak kii sabase adhik kamai karne vaali film bani hui he
 Encouraged by the number, the makers decided to make Saaho in Hindi as well
 yah pehali baar he jab prabhas ne khud hindi kii linon ko dab kiya he
 "the performance changed because of Hindi," he says
 yah zyada darshakon tak pahunchane ke liye kiya gaya tha
 Tamil film stars like Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan had a strong hold and fan following in Bollywood but the Telugu film industry had not really tasted such success
 keval chiranjeevi hi kuch had tak aisa kar sake the
 But in such a short time, the hold of Prabhas has become much more
 telegu film industry main prabhas ko chhatrapati (2005) or mirchi (2013) jaisi filmon ke liye janaa jaataa he, jisane unhen acshan star ke rup main lokapriy banaaya, or romantic kamedi mistar parfect (2011) se unhone sabit kiya ki ve keval acshan star nahin hai, balki unamem isse kahin adhik or vividhtapurna kshamtaayen hai
 In Prabhas in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, people have the same craze as seen in Tamil Nadu regarding Rajinikanth
 iskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki haal hi main jab hyderabad ke ek theatre main saaho kaa trailor chalaa to log bade parade ke saamne naachne lage
 Prabhas co-star Shraddha Kapoor says, "they deserve it
" ve niraale vyakti hai or behad eemaandaar or bhavuk abhinayta
 "yarlagadda also has similar views about Prabhas
 nirmaataa you
 Prabhas, the son of Suryanarayana Raju, had little desire to act in films
 yah ichha tab tak nahin paidaa hui jab tak unhone apane chachaa krishnam raju ko bhakt kanppa film main ek aise naastik kaa kirdaar nibhaate hue nahin dekha, jo dhire-dhire bhagwaan shiv kaa param bhakt ban gaya
 Prabhas recalls, "it created something in me
 kyon na main bhi abhinayta ban jaaun? tab mere man main khyaal aayaa 'nahin, nahin, yah mere liye nahin he
 He eventually joined the family business and in 2002 knocked on the film screen from the film Ishwar
 abhinay kaa nirnay unke liye sahi sabit hua he, lekin ve nishchay kar chuke hai ki raajnneeti main nahin aaenge
 Prabhas's uncle contested and won the Lok Sabha election from Kakinanda seat in Andhra Pradesh in 1998
 prabhas ne chunaav abhiyaan main unke saath yatraaen kin or prachaar kiya
 He says that he did not enjoy anything at all: "it has been 17 years in the film industry and i still have not been comfortable
" raajnneeti to puri tarah se ek alag game he
 "saaho may be a big-budget contemporary film, but basically Prabhas is doing what his fans love the most - the bad guys being smacked in a special way
" ve kehete hai ki bahubali kii tarah saaho main bhi acshan sikvence film ko gati denge
 Interestingly, Prabhas filmmaker Mani Ratnam is called the king of modern romance
 ve chennai main ek lounj main bahubali se bahut pehle ratnam ke saath apni pehali or ekmaatr mulaakaat ko jis prakaar yaad karte hai, usase jhalkata he ki yah superstar ek nirdeshak kaa kitna bada prashansak he
 Prabhas says, "I shook hands with him and said, Sir, i am a big fan of yours
" '' gharelu box offis par unki pichhali film ne 1,000 karod rupye kii kamai kii, iske baavjood unke vyavhaar main koi antar nahin aayaa he
 This humility, which made his characters Amarendra and Mahendra Bahubali on screen the king of people's hearts, made Prabhas the star of the masses
 ththchhatrapati (2005)es
 s
 rajamouli ke saath unki pehali film jisase unki pahchaan ek acshan hero kii banibillaa (2009)ek hit tamil thriller kii rimek thi, jisamen unhone nayak or khalanaayak, donon kii bhoomikaayen nibhaai hanmi
 Perfect (2011) He stunned the audience in the romantic film character of a confused lover Mirchi (2013) in another action film and his most successful film Baahubali before Bahubali: The Beginning (2015) and Baahubali: The Conclusion (2017)
 a national star emerged as Prabhas after playing the role of a brave king

 The central government has decided that the proposed anti-black money bill will be passed in the Lok Sabha in the first week of May to curb black money stashed abroad
 is kanoon kaa elaan vitt mantri arun jetali ne apane bajet bhaashan main kiya tha
 The Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets (imposition of Tax) Bill 2015 was introduced in Lok Sabha on 20 March
 lekin ab saansadon main is vidheyak ke kai praavdhaanon ko lekar ashanka he or wo chaahate hai ki ise sthai samiti ko bheja jaae
 According to sources, mps of opposition parties are constantly contacting the government and their appeal is that the government should not use its majority in the Lok Sabha to pass this bill
 wo chaahate hai ki is bill ko sthai samiti main bheja jaae taaki vahaan praavdhaanon par silsilewar dhang se vichaar ho sake or jarurat padane par vipakshi dal kuch sanshodhan bhi suza saken
 Some ministers say that this attitude of opposition mps is in stark contrast to their stance within Parliament regarding black money as the opposition continued to create a ruckus in the last session seeking to bring back and curb black money
 modi sarkaar vipaksh kaa hamalaa is baat par bhi jhel rahi he ki usne chunaav se pehle kaala dhan ko waapas laa kar har bhartiya ke bank khate main 15 lakh rupye jamaa karaane ke vaade ko puraa nahin kiya he
 The comments udhar, vipakshi saansadon kaa kahana he ki prastaavit kanoon main kai kade praavdhaan kiye ja rahe hai jinaki aad main aam logon ko pareshaan kiya ja saktaa he
 He says that it is necessary to mention the PAN number in transactions of more than one lakh rupees, it can also harm the economy
 prastaavit kanoon main videshon main jamaa aghoshit rakam par 30 fisadi tex or teen guna jurmaane or teen se lekar das saal tak kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan he
 While this amount can be refunded by paying 30% tax and same penalty for a fixed time
 lekin sarkaar is vidheyak ko standig samiti ko bhejne kii vipaksh kii maang ko maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 He says that such strict laws need to be enacted at the earliest to curb black money
 sarkaar kaa ye bhi aarope he ki kuch aise saansad bhi hai jo shaayad dabaav main kaam rahe hai
 On the other hand, the government is also taking steps to make more and more PAN cards
 vitt mantralay kaa kahana he ki jaldi hi har jile main pan card banavaane ke liye vishesh shivi lagaae jaaenge
 Also, the facility to create a PAN card will also be made online and within 48 hours of applying on it, the PAN card will be available
 uskaa kahana he ki ye kadam kaale dhan par ankush lagane kii uski yojana kaa ek ahm hissaa he
 This law was announced by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his budget speech
 andisclosed fahrren inakam and asets (impojishan of tex) bill 2015 ko 20 march ko loksabhaa main rakhaa gaya tha
 But now mps are apprehensive about many provisions of this bill and they want it to be sent to the standing committee
 sutron ke mutabik vipakshi dalon ke saansad lagaataar sarkaar se sampark kar rahe hai or unki apil he ki sarkaar loksabhaa main apane bahumat kaa istemaal is bill ko paas karaane main na kare
 They want this bill to be sent to a standing committee so that the provisions can be discussed in a systematic manner and if necessary, the opposition parties can also suggest some amendments
 kuch mantriyon kaa kahana he ki vipakshi saansadon kaa ye ravaiya kaale dhan ko lekar sansad ke bheetar unke rukh ke bilkul ulat he kyonki pichley satr main kaale dhan ko waapas laane or is par ankush lagane kii maang ko lekar vipaksh lagaataar hangaamaa karata rahaa
 The Modi government is also facing the attack on the opposition that it has not fulfilled the promise of depositing Rs 15 lakh in every Indian bank account by bringing back black money before the election
 tippaniyan On the other hand, opposition mps say that many stringent provisions are being made in the proposed law, under the guise of which the common people can be harassed
 unka kahana he ki ek lakh rupye se adhik ke len-dein main pan number bataanaa jaruri karnaa bhi arthvyavastha ko nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 The proposed law provides for 30 per cent tax on unaccounted money deposited abroad and a three-fold penalty and punishment ranging from three to ten years
 jabaki ek tay samay tak 30 fisadi tex or itnaa hi jurmaana dekar ye rakam waapas laai ja sakati he
 But the government is not ready to accept the opposition's demand to send this bill to the Standing Committee
 uskaa kahana he ki kaale dhan par ankush lagane ke liye is tarah kaa sakht kanoon jald se jald banane kii jarurat he
 The government also alleges that there are some mps who may be working under pressure

 He says that this step is an important part of his plan to curb black money

 Aam Aadmi Party mlas have now come up to win public confidence in the assembly elections
 aap vidhayak pichley saadhe 4 saal ke kaamkaaj kaa report card taiyaar karne main jute gaye hai
 Through the report card, AAP is engaged in collecting accounts of Kejriwal government's development works in Delhi
 iske alaava pichhali sarkaron main virdohi raajnneetik dalon ke vidhayakon ke bakaayaa kaam kii ek kitaab banane main vyast he
 The biggest question is whether this report card will help AAP mlas to get tickets again? Aaj Tak spoke to Aam Aadmi Party mlas about this
 report card aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main prachaar kaa hissaaam aadmi party vidhayakon dwaara taiyaar kiya ja rahaa report card aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main prachaar kaa hissaa bhi hoga
 On the election strategy and report card, 'aaj Tak' first spoke to Sanjeev Jha, MLA from Burari assembly constituency
 'aap' vidhayak sanjeev jha ne kaha ki, 'aam aadmi party ne jo vaade kiye the use jald se jald puure karne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 Also, they are preparing a complete report of the work done in the last five years
 is report main logon ko ham bataaenge ki aam aadmi party ne kitne kaam kiye or puraane baaki vidhayakon ne kya kaam nahin kiya he
 Will present the report card to the public before the election
 'iske baad 'ajtak' ne aam aadmi party ke mahrauli vidhansabha kshetra se vidhayak naresh yadav se baatcheet kii
 'AAP' MLA Naresh Yadav said that he prepares a report of work done in his area every year
 chunaav se pehle report card ke bare main bataate hue unhone kaha ki, 'agle kuch maheenon main chunaav hone hai, isliye pichley saadhe 4 saal ke kaamkaaj kii ek report taiyaar kar rahe hai
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal keeps giving annual reports of his work
 hamaari sarkaar ne aisa system banaaya he, jisamen vidhayakon ke har kaam kii jaankaree hoti he
 'pankaj Pushkar, MLA from Timarpur assembly constituency of Aam Aadmi Party is also preparing to make a report card
 report card ke bare main puche jane par 'aap' vidhayak pankaj pushkar ne kaha, 'mere khyaal se har vidhayak apane tareeke se apane kaam kaa moolyankan kar rahaa he or janata ke bich ja rahaa he
 We are preparing a report card based on our functioning
 jaise pariksha main jane se pehle taiyaari kerani hoti he vaise hi vidhansabha chunaav kii taiyaariyaan kar rahe hai
 i will also put the report card in front of the party leadership
 'haalanki kya vidhayakon ke liye ek report card, sirf janata kaa bharosa jeetne ke liye bada hathiyaar sabit hoga? yaa phir party netritv yaa mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal bhi aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main vidhayak ke kaamkaaj ke aadhaar par ummidavaar kaa chayan karenge? in sawaalon ko jab 'ajtak' ne aam aadmi party vidhayakon se poocha to dilachasp jawaab saamne aae
 What says on the report card MLA from Burari assembly constituency Sanjeev Jha says, 'report card is for telling the public
 jabaki tikat dene kaa kaam upar ke logon kaa he vahi tikat tay karenge
 On the question of ticket being given on the basis of report card, 'AAP' MLA from Timarpur Assembly constituency Pankaj Pushkar replied that, 'I think tickets should be given only after looking at the report card
 kyonki ham vanshavaadi parampara se nahin aate hai, ham ek gaiyr raajnneetik vansh se aate hai or ham sab ko mauka mila he ki nae tareeke se nae idia ke saath sarkaar main kaam kar saken
 Therefore, after checking the report card, the party leadership must decide
 'to vahiin mahrauli se aam aadmi party ke vidhayak naresh yadav kaa kahana he ki vidhayakon ke kaamkaaj par survey ke aadhaar par hi chunaav kaa tikat milanaa chahie
 'AAP' MLA Naresh Yadav said, 'there is no basis to cut the ticket
 ye, jaruri he ki vidhayak kii janata ke bich kya chhavi he? kya aap janata ke bich jeetne vaale vidhayak banenge? har party ko sochna chahie ki ek vidhayak apane saadhe 4 saal ke kaam ke aadhaar par jeet saktaa he yaa nahin
 There should be a survey based on which tickets are available
 'saal 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main 70 main se 67 siten jitkar satta main aane vaali aam aadmi party ke liye aagaamee chunaav ek badi chunauti ho saktaa he
 The Aam Aadmi Party mlas are working fast to give an account of how much the party's 70 point agenda has met on the ground
 aam aadmi party ne aagaamee chunaav ke liye 'aapkaa vidhayak aapke dwaar' jaise kaaryakramon kii shuruyaat bhi kar di he
 However, whether the party leadership will change the elected mlas, or give them a chance again, it will be clear in the coming days
 lekin yahaan ye bhi dekhnaa hoga ki janata kaa bharosa jeetne ke liye vidhayakon dwaara taiyaar kiya ja rahaa report card, khud in vidhayakon ko tikat ke najadik pahunchane main kitna madadgaar sabit hota he

 guuruuvaar ko unhone bijepi se kaha tha ki vah unhen daraane yaa dhamkaane kii koshish na karen or shivasena ko apana raajnneetik rasta chunane de
 Raut had said that we are ready to die and fight

 Despite the attacks on Kargil, Kandahar and Parliament, whatever positivity was seen in Kashmir between 1999 and 2004 was all due to this genius
 vaajapeyi ke inasaaniyat ke nazariye or unke dilaae bharose ke kaaran kashmiriyon ne aatankwaad ko khaarij kar diya
 For Vajpayee, Kashmiris had an extraordinary love and respect in their hearts
 ek dafe kii baat he, suraksha balon ko kashmir ke oonche ilaakon main chupe aatankwaadiyon ko khoj nikaalane main baari dikkatein aa rahi thim to kisi ne mashvira diya ki helicopter par lage gan kaa istemaal karnaa chahie lekin vaajapeyi ne iske liye saaf manaa kar diya
 He was absolutely against the use of wild power against "his own people"
 isaki bajaae jab 2000 main hijbul mujahidin ke saath chalaa aa rahaa sangharsh viraam khatm ho gaya tab bhi vaajapeyi ne ramajaan ke dauraan bina shart sangharsh viraam kii peshkash kii
 The result was the 2003 ceasefire, which was designed by the heads of the ISI and RAW
 tab donon deshon kii khufia agenciyon ke bich samanvay aisa tha ki iesai ne ro se mili khufia jaankaree ke aadhaar par musharraf kii jaan bachaai thi
 General Musharraf also thanked for this
 agar 2002 kaa chunaav safal rahaa, to yah vaajapeyi kii adhiktam bhagidaari kii soch kaa nateeja tha
 Vajpayee was very fond of Omar Abdullah
 vaajapeyi unhen bhavishya ke mukhyamantri ke rup main dekh rahe the par umr chunaav haar gaye
 The National Conference was undoubtedly the largest party but did not have the numbers to form a government
 lekin pehali baar algaavvaadiyon ne chunaavon main hissaa liya tha or pidipi sarkaar main piples conference ke ek mantri bhi bane
 This was also the beginning of Sajjad Lone coming into the mainstream
 unke pita abdul gani lone, algaavvaadi netaaon main sabase kaddavar netaa maane jate the or unka kahana tha ki kashmir kaa masalaa keval vaajapeyi hi sulajhaa sakate hai
 As Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said, "vajpayee was a rare leader who believed in finding the path of Kashmir's troubles, with humanness
 ''unhone hurriyat ke saath bina shart baatcheet kii peshkash karke kashmir masale ko sulajhane kii eemaandaar koshish kii
 When the Hurriyat leaders came to the Prime Minister's residence for talks in 2004, Vajpayee was quite happy with the warmth he showed in the talks
 april 2003 main srinagar main ek jalse main vaajapeyi ne kaha ki unhone do baar pakistan kii taraf dosti kaa haath badhaayaa lekin usne donon baar haath jhatak diya; phir bhi ve haar nahin maanenge or dosti kii ek or peshkash karenge
 The Kashmiris were jubilant upon hearing this
 aaj hamane kashmiriyon ko sunanaa band kar diya he, hamen jarurat he ki ham vaajapeyi ko apana adarsh banaaen
 When it reached Srinagar that Atalji was in poor health and admitted to the Aquas, he was prayed in mosques and homes for his well-being
 vaajapeyi ke intkaal ke baad jab maine hurriyat netaa pro
 Abdul Ghani Bhatt got a call, he was inconsolable
 unhone kaha, "aaj atalji ke alaava ham or kya baat kar sakate hai?ve aman baantne vaale shaks the
 He had the ability to find a suitable way out of every difficulty
 '' bhatta kaa maananaa tha ki "agar vaajapeyi ko or mauka mila hota, to aaj bharat or pakistan, donon saath-saath chalate tarakkee kar rahe hote
 "my friend and co-author of Spy Chronicles, General Asad Durrani once remarked," Pakistan is in dire need of Vajpayee
 '' kya abhi bhi hamen shaq he ki kashmir masalaa atalji ke raste chalakar hi hal ho saktaa he?lekhak research and analysis wing (ro) ke purv pramukh hai*** India's mobile company Micromax and indigenous e-commerce company Flipkart will jointly launch the smartphone

 opinian pols bataate hai ki yun to yahaan kathin ladaai he, magar janata dal secular or congress par bijepi badhat hasil kar sakati he
 After the assembly elections last year, the two parties joined hands to keep the BJP out of power
 maujuuda loksabhaa chunaav main donon dal saath-saath chunaav lard rahe hai
 According to opinion polls, a coalition of Congress and JDS can win 13 out of 28 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 haalanki, yah 2014 se keval do seat hi adhik hoga, jab donon dalon ne alag-alag chunaav ladaa tha
 At that time, Congress had won nine seats and JDS two
 bijepi ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 17 siten jiti thim
 Due to the jds-congress alliance, the BJP may come down by two seats
 pichley chunaavon ke aankade bataate hai ki paanch pratishat voton kaa swing bhi chunaav main bada parivartan laa saktaa he
 If this swing happens on the BJP, it can get 20 seats, while if the 5 percent swing is on the jds-congress alliance then the alliance may get 19 seats
 dilachasp baat he ki karnataka main hue ateet ke chunaavon main kisi dal ko baari jeet milti rahi he
 Which can be called Landslide Victory or Massive Victory
 Landslide victory us jeet ko kaha jaataa he jab jeetne vaali party ko duusari party kii tulana main doguni siten milteen hai
 However, the trend has seen a decline in the last few elections
 pichley chunaavon ke aankadon se pataa chalata he ki 1952 se 2002 ke bich, rajya main 88 pratishat jeet 'baari bahumat' vaali raheen hai, jabaki 2002 se 2014 ke bich yah margin ghatakar 67 fisad rah gaya
 Since the BJP became a major player in Karnataka politics, the series of heavy victories in the bipartisan contest was reduced, as the politics of Karnataka became triangular

 ) Journalist Atish Ali Taseer authored by OCI cancellation- The Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card of journalist Atish Ali Taseer has been punished for what i wrote in the magazine
 britain main janme lekhak aatish ali taasir par pita ke pakistani mul ke hone kii jaankaree chupaane kaa aarope he
 Let us tell you that Taseer, writing an article on Prime Minister Narendra Modi in TIME magazine, called him a 'divider in chief'
 osiai radd hone ke baad taasir ne TIME ke jariye hi apana paksh saamne rakhaa he
 Know what he said
 bharat ke grih mantralay kaa letters sitambar 2019 main aayaa
 My mother sent a letter from whatsapp stating that the Indian government is canceling my Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI), because India does not recognize dual nationality and OCI (one for persons of Indian origin) Permanent Visa) is roughly the status around dual citizenship
 mere paas jawaab dene or in par daawa karne ke liye 21 din the, lekin jab mujhe letters mila to wo 20waan din tha
 If i do not respond, it is assumed that i have nothing to say and then my OCI will be canceled
 lekin letters milane ke baad maine unke daawey par turant email se jawaab diya, jo neuyok ke bhartiya rajdoot ke paas pahunchaa
 After that its hard copy was submitted to the Ministry of Home Affairs
 7 november kod printne bataaya ki mere daawey par samiksha kii ja rahi he
 Now the government announced via Twitter that it has canceled my overseas citizenship of India, which i heard for the first time
 'mujhe congress kaa piaar prabandhak bataaya gaya'jab may 2019 main bharat main loksabhaa chunaav charam par tha, tabhi maine TIME ke liye lekh likhaa tha, jo pradhanmantri narendra modi ke liye aalochanatmak tha
 Time magazine described PM Narendra Modi as "india's Divider in Chief" i
e
 "india's leading divisive"
 modi kii is chhavi se unke samarthakon main khaasaa rosh dikhaa
 After this, in a week, people put wrong information about me on Wikipedia and i was accused of working as a PR manager for the Congress party
 soshal media par log mere peeche pade rahe, kai log maarane kii dhamkiyaan de rahe the or soshal media par pakistani paband ke rup main meraa mim banaakar failaayaa ja rahaa tha
 Suddenly i was also portrayed as a Western agent
 main paashchaatya rang main ranga hum, main agreji bolne vaala hum, main ucch varg kaa hissaa hum, lekin iske alaava bhi mujh par hamale ke liye ek or vajah thi jo mujhe samvedansheel bana diya
 My father was born in British India to a British parent
 baad main desh vibhajit hone ke baad ve pakistani ho gaye
 Time Story Pakistani has written: Within 24 hours of my article being published in Patratime magazine, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra attacked
 ek press conference ko sambodhit karte hue paatra ne kaha ki time story ek pakistani ne likhi he or pakistan se kuch bhi behatar kii ummid nahin kii ja sakati he
 This was a dangerous and inaccurate statement
 paatra ne kaha tha lekhak pakistan ke ek raajnneetik gharaane se taalluk rakhata he, jo vishwasaneeyata ke liye paryaapt he
 i was born outside and i was not in touch with my father until i was 21 years old
 2 saal kii umr se bharat main rahaamen british shashan main paidaa hua or mere paas britain kii naagarikta he
 i lived in India with my mother since i was 2 and grew up there
 meri bhartiya maa jo ek jaani-maani patrkaar hai
 She raised me in Delhi and she was the sole legal guardian for me
 main jivan ke zyaadaatar samay main abhibhavak ke rup main apni maa ko hi jaanata tha
 That is why i was always seen as an Indian in India and that is why i was given OCI
 mere mata-pita ke bhavuk sambandh kii kahani meri pehali kitaab 'stranger tu history' kaa bhi vishay bhi rahaa, jise 2009 main prakashit kiya gaya tha or bharat main isaki vyapak str par samiksha kii gai thi
 i was living in India at that time
 us samay se lekar sitambar tak kabhi bhi sarkaar ne poochtacha nahin kii or na koi chunauti di gai thi
 i expected anger and vengeance, but not seriously
 haalanki, sarkaar ne shuru main is karrwai ke peeche ke kaaran ko prakat nahin kiya tha
 Now go and explain my reasons for canceling my OCI, that i hid the fact that my father was of Pakistani origin, but it is not difficult to understand that i was punished for what i wrote in Time magazine

 And after this, she saw her husband dying before her eyes

 So everyone was depressed and sad

 Despite this, both were not ready to accept this truth
