 Only then did the high command replace senior leader Kamal Nath Shakeel Ahmed

 The question arose that, either they were not made and they were made, they were not removed
 pehle se ye sari baaten kyon nahin sochi gayi
 Kamal Nath was named after Asha Kumari after several names, after which the high command did several rounds, but the result did not come

 US President Donald Trump has imposed tariff duty on steel and aluminum, ignoring the apprehensions raised about the world's trade war
 unhone guuruuvaar ko is sambandh main hui ghoshnaa par hastakshar kar die hai
 According to the announcement, they have imposed 25 percent duty on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports
 ye emport tarriff 15 dinon ke bheetar prabhavi ho jaaenge
 US President Donald Trump indicated on March 1 that he would impose tariff duties on steel and aluminum imports
 apane daawey ke mutabik hi unhone yah duty lagaai he
 However, Canada and Mexico are excluded from this duty
 iske saath hi trump ne rashtriya suraksha ke aadhaar par anya deshon ke liye bhi daravaaje khule rakhe hai
 On the occasion, 'I am doing security of the nation', Trump said that i am working to improve the national security of America by imposing duties on steel and aluminum coming from abroad
 unhone kaha ki vah aane vaale samay main or bhi duty laga sakate hai
 Trump said that in countries where higher tariffs are levied on the products of American companies, then we will also levy more tax on the products coming from there

 This has increased the possibility of trade war
 china ne iskaa purajor virodh kiya he
 China has already said that trade war is never beneficial
 france ne bhi isko lekar naaraazgi jataai he
 In such a situation, it is feared that an atmosphere of trade war may arise
 china par kya hoga asarchin duniya kaa sabase bada steel niryaatak desh he
 In such a situation, he can also retaliate
 jawaab main vah bhi america companiyon par tarriff badhanaa shuru kar saktaa he
 This can worsen the atmosphere
 bharat par iskaa kya asar?bharat par iskaa zyada asar nahin hoga
 In fact, the US accounts for only 2% of India's total exports
 haalanki is faisle ke baad bharat main steel kii supplai bad sakati he
 Experts have expressed concern that the steel that was going to America before Trump took such a step could be sent to India
 aise main bharat anti-damping duty par gaur karnaa hoga
 What is trade war trade ie trade war is the result of protectionism between two countries
 yah sthiti tab paidaa hoti he, jab koi desh kisi desh se aane vaale saamaan par tarriff duty badhaata he
 In response to this, the front country also starts increasing duty
 zyaadaatar samay par duniya kaa koi bhi desh yah kadam tab uthaata he, jab vah apni gharelu industry or companiyon kaa sangrakshan karne ke liye kadam uthaata he
 The effect of this trade war is gradually visible on the whole world
 isaki vajah se vaishvik str par kaarobaar ko lekar chintaa kaa maahaul taiyaar ho jaataa he

 sheersh court ne kaha tha ki jab laudspikar or deje nahin the, tab maanav sabhyataa viksit hui or logon ne alag alag dharm apanaaya
 Great religious texts were also written at the same time
 court ne kaha tha ki koi bhi dharm kisi duusare vyakti ko uski ichha ke viruddh apni baat sunne ke liye majaboor nahin karata he
 No one can be compelled to listen to bhajans or ajans
 During the hearing of this case, the court also said that in the Gita, Lord Krishna, while teaching Arjuna, said that if a person does not want to listen to the teachings of the Gita, then This sermon should not be recited
 iske alaava quran main kaha gaya he ki 'lakum deenakum walia deen' yani tumhaara majahab va vishwaas tumhaara he or meraa majahab va vishwaas meraa he
 All are happy in their religion
 iskaa matlab yah he ki koi bhi laudspikar yaa deje ke jariye kisi duusare ko apane dharm ke upadesh yaa pravachan yaa bhajan yaa ajaan ko sunne ke liye majaboor nahin kar saktaa he
 Playing loudspeakers and djs can be jailed
 Apart from this, playing loud loudspeakers or djs in any public place including temple, mosque, church, gurudwara is a public nuisance under Section 268 of Indian Penal Code i
e
 IPC
 agar aam logon ko inase dikkat hoti he, to kanoon karrwai kii kaa sakati he
 For this, provision of jail and fine has been made in sections 290 and 291 of IPC
 is sambandh main edwocket markendeya pant kaa kahana he ki agar koi vyakti saarvajanik sthaan par tej laudspikar or deje bajaakar public newsence paidaa karata he, to uske khilaaf shikaayat kii ja sakati he
 Upon receiving such a complaint, a magistrate-level officer investigates the case and if he believes that playing a loudspeaker or DJ creates a public nuisance, he can order his removal

 The party has now decided to go to court in this matter so that the country can be protected from such frauds in future and to protect democracy

 agar ve anya rajyon main bhi aisa hi karte to janata kii ore se uthne vaale sawaalon kaa uchit jawaab dene kii sthiti main nahin hote or aasaani se pakad main aa jate
 The BJP did not tamper with evms in smaller states as they also needed something to protect themselves
 mayawati ne kaha ki uttar pradesh main bhaajapa ne aisa isliye kiya kyonki vah kahati thi ki kendra kaa rasta uttar pradesh se hokar jaataa he isliye bhaajapa ne isi par dhyaan kendrit kiya
 "he (BJP) won by manipulating evms and this victory was achieved by dishonesty, fraud and murder of democracy
" ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘party ke log kah rahe hai ki unhone basapa ke liye vot kiya lekin hamaare vot camel main kaise jud gayi 
 
 unhen hairat he ki aisa kaise ho saktaa he
 Mayawati said that BJP got votes in Muslim and Dalit dominated areas too
 bhaajapa kahati he ki teen talaak mudde par use musalmaan mahilaon kaa vot mila he jabaki sachai ye he ki bhaajapa ne ek bhi musalmaan ko tikat nahin diya
 If the BJP was a well wisher of Muslim women, it would have given at least 20 to 25 tickets to Muslims
 tippaniyan He said that if the BJP has any basis for denying tampering of evms and if it is truly honest and loyal to democracy, then it should not run away from the allegations of BSP and immediately conduct elections through 'ballot paper' afresh

 basapa netaa ne 11 march ko vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey ghoshit hone ke turant baad yojit ek samvaadadaata sammelan main iviem se chhedchhad kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 He says that to hide the dishonest victory, BJP is now saying that if EVM were wrong, they would have done the same in Punjab, Goa and Manipur
 mayawati ne kaha ki bhaajapa ko janata ko itnaa bholaa nahin samajhnaa chahie
 If they had done the same in other states, they would not have been in a position to answer the questions arising from the public and would have been easily caught
 bhaajapa ne chote rajyon main iviem se chhedchhad nahin kii kyonki unhen apane bachaav ke liye bhi kuch chahie tha
 Mayawati said that the BJP did this in Uttar Pradesh because she used to say that the way to the center goes through Uttar Pradesh, so the BJP focused on it
 ‘‘unhone (bhaajapa) iviem main gadabadi karke jeet hasil kii or yah jeet beyimaani, dhokhadhadi or loktantr kii hatya kar hasil kii gayi he
 "he said," People of the party are saying that they voted for the BSP but how our votes got added to the lotus
 
 They wonder how this can happen
 ’’ mayawati ne kaha ki muslim or dalit bahul ilaakon main bhi bhaajapa ko vot mili
 BJP says that it has got Muslim women vote on triple talaq issue whereas the truth is that BJP did not give ticket to a single Muslim
 agar bhaajapa muslim mahilaon kii shubhachintak hoti to vah kam se kam 20 se 25 tikat musalamaanon ko detii
 The comments unhone kaha ki bhaajapa kaa agar iviem se chhedchhad se inkaar karne kaa koi aadhaar he or agar vah vaaki eemaandaar or loktantr ke prati nishthavan he to use basapa ke aaropon se bhaagna nahin chahie or tatkaal naye sire se ‘ballat paper’ ke jariye chunaav karaane chahie

 Regarding the Supreme Court's decision on Delhi, Union Minister Vijay Goel says that there is nothing new in the decision given by the Supreme Court
 unhone kaha ki samvidhan main jiske jo bhi adhikaar likhe hai court ne uski samiksha kii he
 He has clearly stated that Delhi is a union territory and does not have all his rights
 unhone kaha ki alji ko baat-baat par file nahin rokani chahie, adnga nahin lagaana chahie
 He said that the elected government should be heard, so i understand that there is nothing new or special in this
 kejariwal ke paas nahin hoga kaam na karne kaa bahanakejariwal dwaara ise badi jeet maane jane par vijay goyal kaa kahana he ki agar wo isko badi jeet maan rahe hai to yah acchhee baat he
 Now at least they have no excuse not to work
 unke vidhayak yaa mantri bhrashtachar main lipt the unase alji kaa koi matlab nahin he, pani kii samasya itani badi thi usapar alji ne kabhi kuch nahin bolaa, bijli kii samasya khadi hui,bijli ke ratebadha die gaye to usamen alji kaa koi role nahin tha
 The High Court commented on the education of schools that there was no infrastructure inside the schools in which LG had no role
 vijay goyal ne kaha ki agar kejariwal ise badi jeet maanate hai to ab unke paas kaam nahin karne kaa koi bahaanaa nahin hoga
 There is pollution in Delhi, there is a water problem, there is a problem of electricity, electricity rates have increased, there is a problem of traffic, now Kejriwal will help people get rid of these problems
 agar aapako badi jeet mil gai he to ab kaam karke dikhaaiye
 Constitution of Delhi is constitution Vijay Goel on Delhi's boss says that the boss is the constitution
 abhi bhi samvidhan ne jo bhi faisla diya ho nirnay to vahi hoga jo samvidhan main likhaa hoga
 Or will be based on the rules that remain for the capital of the country
 sarvocch nyaayalay ne jo baat kahi he uske anusaar chuni hui sarkaar kaa jo vichaar he unke mat kaa bhi dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie
 If a new law is made, the law has to go to the President or go to the LG, then it has to go
 alji centre sarkaar kaa pratinidhi he
 On the issue of aap's full state quarrel with politics, Vijay Goel says that not only full state status, things cannot be done which are not in the constitution
 agar centre purna rajya kaa darja de to vah samvidhan main aa jayega
 The Aam Aadmi Party has completely eliminated the hope of getting full statehood by spreading chaos
 araajaktaa failaakar aap har samvidhanik sanstha se panga lenge, jhagada karenge or dharne par baithenge to aap dilli ke liye kaam nahin kar paaenge
 The politics of the common man party is to fight
 vijay goyal kaa kahana he ki dilli or centre sarkaar kaam karne ke liye pehle bhi talmail ke saath kaam karte the
 The Supreme Court has said that while honoring the elected government, the work that they are doing, increase the work as much as they can
 kejariwal ke bolne se kya he unki to kisi bhi alji se nahin bani
 i think now he will learn and not go to court all the time

 kumaar vishwaas bole ki yuddh kaa ek niyam hota he, shaheedon ke shav se chhedchhad nahin kii jaati he
 Without your (arvind Kejriwal) wish nothing happens there, it is quite difficult to survive in the party by disagreeing with you
 kumaar ne iske saath hi ek twit bhi kiya

 There is a lot of debate in the Lok Sabha about 33 percent reservation for women, but till date this bill has not been passed in Parliament
 bijepi or congress donon ne is baar apane menifesto main kaha tha ki agar wo satta main aati he to mahilaon ke liye 33 pratishat siten arakshit rakhegi
 This time the NDA has got a majority and the BJP has a chance to fulfill its promise
 mahilaon ke liye loksabhaa main 33 pratishat seat aarakshan ko lekar sabhi partiyaan baat to karti hai lekin asaliyat main is aarakshan ko lekar gambhir nazar nahin aati hai
 BJP and Congress could have given tickets to 33 percent women candidates in this Lok Sabha election but it did not happen
 mahilaon ko tikat dene ke liye koi niyam nahin he
 It depends on the intention and decision of any party
 ek aisi party jisane 33 pratishat tikat mahilaon ko diya tha wo he biju janata dal
 Parliament has the highest number of women in the 17th Lok Sabha
 inamen se saat saansad odisha se bhi hai
 Out of which 5 are from Biju Janata Dal (BJD) and two are from BJP
 bijedy kii in saansadon main ab tak kii sabase kam umr kii adivasee mahila saansad chandrani murmu bhi shaamil hai
 Murmu is only 25 years old and he is an engineer
 murmu ne odisha kii kenjhar loksabhaa seat se jeet darj kii he
 Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said before the election that his party will give 33 percent seats to women in this time's Lok Sabha elections
 naveen ne apana vaada nibhaayaa or 21 siton main se 7 siton par mahila ummidavaaron ko ladaaya
 Five of these seven candidates also won
 odisha se bijepi kii bhi do mahila ummidavaar is baar sansad pahunch rahi hai
 The BJP fielded six women candidates
 rajya se is baar kul milakar saat mahila saansad loksabhaa main baithengi
 Winning mps include Pramila Bisoyi (asaka, BJD), Manjulata Mandal (bhadrak, BJD), Rajshree Malik (jagatsinghpur, BJD), Sharmishtha Sethi (jajpur, BJD) Chandrani Murmu (keonjhar, BJD), Aparajita Sadangi (bhubaneswar, BJP) ) And Sangeeta Kumari Singhdev (balangiri, BJP)
 in chunaavon main puure desh se sirf 14 pratishat ke kareeb mahila ummidavaar jitkar sansad pahunch rahi hai, vahiin odisha se 33 pratishat mahilaon ne jeet hasil kii he
 This is the first time in the history of Odisha when such a large number of women are simultaneously reaching the Lok Sabha
 jiti saansadon main keval pramila bisoyi ko chhodkar sabhi padhi likhi hai
 If someone is a graduate, then a post graduate
 iske alaava kisi bhi saansad ke khilaaf koi criminal cese nahin he
 The popular young tribal woman MP Murmu is currently 25 years 11 months old
 kenjhar se jiti murmu odisha kii sabase kam umr kii saansad hone ke saath-saath desh kii bhi sabase kamr umr kii saansad hai
 Chandrani does not have much experience in politics
 2017 main chandrani ne bhubaneshwar se apni ejineering kii degree puri kii
 After getting the degree, Chandrani was offered a ticket from BJD when she was looking for a job
 chandrani is maukey ko ganvaana nahin chaahati thim
 She accepted the party's proposal and went to the polls
 unhone jeet hasil kii or sabase kam umr kii saansad ban gayi
 No one from Chandrani's family is in politics
 chandrani ke mata-pita sarkari naukari karte hai
 Chandrani defeated BJP candidate Anant Nayak by a margin of around 66200 votes in the election
 anant nayak bijepi ke tikat se kyonjhar se do baar saansad rahe chuke hai
 He first won in 1999
 phir 2004 main bhi jeet hasil kar vah loksabhaa pahunche the
 After this, he had to face defeat in the elections of 2009 and 2014
 chandrani ke paas na khud kii gaadi he, na ghar or na hi zyada bank balance
 Talking to NDTV, Chandrani said about his election campaign, 'during this campaign people got a lot of love
 jeet ke baad ab main apane kshetra ke logon ke liye khub kaam karongi
 i will try my best to solve their problems
 'chunavi halafanaame main bataai sampatti ke anusaar chandrani murmu ke paas sirf 2 xxrep 4 0 cash he
 He has two bank accounts

 a post shared by Virat Kohli (@virat
 kohli) on Oct 8, 2017 at 4:20 am PDT isse pehle bollywood actor anupam kher mangalvaar ko dhoni or unke pita ke saath apni tasviir twitor account par share kii thi
 In his tweet, he also praised Jeeva
 west indies ke khilaaf kochi main khele gaye shrunkhlaa ke pehle ek-divasiy antarrashtriya match viraat kohli jis tarah out hue, usase laga ki vah england ke daure se akele lautakar nahin aae, balki apane saath apni ballebaazi kii khaamiyon ko bhi laae hai
 Seeing his game in Kochi, he did not feel that he had learned anything from the mistakes made in England
 of stump se baahar jaati gend par balla lagaana or phir gend kaa slip main chale janaa maano ab viraat kohli kii pari kii khaasiyat ho gai he
 The statistics of the decline of his form in the last six months clearly shows that the speed with which Virat Kohli reached the top, he is coming down as fast as possible
 aankadon main dekhen to viraat ne pichley chah maheenon main saat van-de international match khele hai, jinamein unhone kul 61 ran banaae, or unka ausat rahaa maatr 12
 Of 20
 is dauraan test maichon kii 10 pariyon main bhi unhone sirf 134 ran banaae
 Experts believe that if Virat Kohli stays away from the game for a few days before the Cricket World Cup 2015, then he can work towards correcting his mistakes, but the player on whom the market has crores of rupees at stake, which Team India Who can dare to be considered the 'captain of the future'? vaise bhi, jis team ke diarector ravi shastri ko bhi viraat kohli ke form kii koi chintaa na dikhaai detii ho, us team main kohli par acha pradarshan karne kaa dabaav kitna hoga, yah samajhnaa katai mushkil nahin
 On the other hand, the impact of Virat Kohli's poor form is very evident on Team India's figures
 agar team india ko cricket worldcup kaa taj bachaana he to uske liye kohli kaa form main aana kitna zaruri he, yah in aankadon se samajhane kii koshish karte hai
 
 
 So, everything is clean like a mirror
 cricket worldcup 2015 kii taiyaariyon ke liye viraat kohli ke paas bahut kam vakt bachaa he, so, hamaare vichaar se kuch vakt cricket se dur rahakar apni takanic par kaam karnaa hi shaayad viraat kohli ke liye sabase sahi upaay he

 Former Congress president Sonia Gandhi is in the fray for the fifth time from Rae Bareli

 Sonia Gandhi was first elected from Rae Bareli seat in 2004

 There is a tough fight between Rahul Gandhi and bjp's Smriti Irani

 Varun Gandhi continues to maintain his lead

 Among the star campaigners of the BJP in this state are UP CM Yogi Adityanath
 unke karnataka main prachaar karne ko lekar siem siddharmaiya samet kai congressi netaaon ne sawaal bhi uthaae the
 But his campaign benefited the BJP
 yogi ne jin ilaakon main raily kii vah matadaataaon ko bijepi ke paksh main booth tak khinchne main safal rahe
 In the first week of Dauramai, after the storm in UP, in several states of North India, the storm caused havoc, while former UP CM Akhilesh Yadav, including Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah questioned many of the Yogi's stay in Karnataka
 is tufaan ne sabase zyada tabaahi upi main hi machaai thi
 In view of this, Yogi Adityanath shortened his tour to Karnataka
 haalanki, baad main vah phir se karnataka main laute or chunaav prachaar ke aakhri daur main phir se maidan main utre
 Wherever Yogi went, Huaya Party is among the beneficial BJP campaigners, whose campaigning was also seen in the election results
 yogi ne karnataka ke jin ilaakon main party ummidavaaron ke paksh main prachaar, reliyaan, sabhaayen kin, unamem bijepi ummidavaaron ko jeet naseeb hui
 Yogi campaigned for the party in 33 seats or areas adjacent to it
 reliyon vaale ilaakon main jeet dilaane ke maamle main yogi adityanath modi se bhi aage rahe
 The Yogi Yogi comes from the Adityanath Nath sect, with the slogan of organized Hindutva, and was introduced by the BJP as a star campaigner to woo the voters of this sect
 dakshin karnataka or udupi main nath sampradaay ke log acchhee sankhya main maujuud hai
 Apart from this, in response to the Congress's Lingayat card, BJP was giving the slogan of organized Hindutva, which Yogi Adityanath raised prominently in his rallies
 in siton par kiya prachaaryogi ne apane prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan sirsi, sagar, balehonru, belur, honahali, haliyaala, moodebihala, mudhol, terdaal, dharwar, bhalki, humanabad, gokak, khanpur, yamakanamradi, gramin belgaum kaa daura kiya
 Apart from this he had public meetings, roadshows and meetings in Bindur, Bhatkal, Moodbindre, Virajpet, Sulia, Hirekeruru, Haspet, Atibele, Sahkaranagar, Indi, Chadchan and Bantwal

 rahul bajaj ne kaha tha ki kaarobaariyon main bhay kaa maahaul haiek kaarykram main grih mantri amit shah ke saamne unhone yah baat kahi thirahul bajaj ke bayaan ko unke bete rajeev ne 'asaadhaaran saahasik' bataaya heprakhyat udyogpati rahul bajaj dwaara modi sarkaar kii aalochana vaale bayaan ko unke bete or bajaj auto ke emdi rajeev bajaj ne 'asaadhaaran saahasik' bataaya he
 He also said that no one in the industry wants to stand with his father, instead he sits and claps as per his' convenience
 'gauratlab he ki shanivaar ko ek akhbaar ke kaarykram main rahul bajaj ne grih mantri amit shah se kaha tha ki jab upie sarkaar satta main thi, to ham kisi kii bhi aalochana kar sakate the
 Now if we openly criticize the BJP government, there is not so much confidence that you will like it
 unhone kaha tha ki kaarobaariyon main 'dar kaa maahaul' he
 Since his statement, there has been continuous political backlash
 congress jahaan unke samarthan main utar ai he, vahiin vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne bajaj ke bayaan ko rashtrahit par chot bataaya he
 Nirmala Sitharaman, while replying to industrialist Rahul Bajaj, wrote that there are better ways to get answers than to spread your perception
 aisi baton se rashtriya hit par chot lag sakati he
 At the same time, Home Minister Amit Shah responded to Rahul Bajaj's talk from the same forum
 amit shah ne kaha ki is baat ko khaarij kiya ki desh main dar kaa mouhaal he
 He said, 'no one needs to be afraid of anybody, the Narendra Modi government is constantly criticized in the media, but if you are saying that such a situation has arisen, then we need to fix it need work
 'sach baalane se hichakate nahin mere pita: rajiviconomic times ko die ek intervyuu rajeev bajaj ne kaha ki sach kitna bhi kadava kyon na ho, unke pita kabhi bhi bolne se hichakate nahin hai
 However, he also said that he is not sure whether his father should have raised such a sensitive issue at such a stage
 kya aise maukey par bolnaa thik tha ?rajeev ne kaha, 'unke (rahul bajaj) liye koi darbar aise hi he, jaise kisi bail ke liye laal kaaleen! vah aise maukey ko chhodte nahin, haalanki vyaktigat rup se main ise lekar aashwast nahin hum ki corporate excilence ko celibratt kar rahe kisi saarvajanik kaarykram main aise samvedansheel vishay kaa uthaanaa chahie yaa nahin
 Rahul Bajaj had said that he does not talk much to the ministers or senior officials of the government
 iske pehle farvari 2017 main rahul bajaj ne modi sarkaar kii notebandi kii aalochana kii thi jiske baad bajaj khud virodhiyon ke nishane par aa gaye the
 Rajiv Bajaj said that many people in the industry were expressing concern over his father's statements at the time, but soon after, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari and NITI Aayog Vice Chairman had approved the car of the Bajaj Auto, which was allowed for 8 years
 Was stopped by
 aaj tak ne ek bada khulaasa kiya he
 One such revelation that anyone should be surprised to see
 ham aapako jaraayam kii duniya ke us betaj badshaah ke 'mananeey' banane kii wo kahani bataane ja rahe hai, jise usne jhooth kii buniyaad par taiyaar kii
 But after the revelation till date, now the curtain has been lifted from the lie
 is par chunaav ayog kaa shikanja kas saktaa he
 Aaj Tak has found the order letter and some important documents of the Uttar Pradesh Governor sent by the 42-year-old government
 ab is chunavi bayaar main is netaji ke liye nayaa sankat khadaa ho gaya he
 Mitrasen Yadav is currently a SP MLA from Bikapur assembly seat in Faizabad
 ye faijabad loksabhaa seat se sapa ke ummidavaar bhi hai
 Bahubali is known as the leader in the region
 aparaadh se inkaa purana naata he
 In the recent affidavit filed while filing the nomination, he has admitted that there are 35 criminal cases like murder, attempt to murder, robbery, rebellion, kidnapping
 kshetra main inkaa khaasaa dabadabaa he
 Perhaps this is the reason that he has also been a 6-time MLA and 3 times MP
 mitrasen yadav ek sajayaftaa mujrim hai
 The court sentenced them to life imprisonment, but even after getting life imprisonment, they became mlas and mps and no one raised a finger
 apradhi ke 'mananeey' banane kii kahaniapake jehan main yah sawaal kaundh rahaa hoga ki aakhir phir ye mananeey kaise ban gaye? yah bhi jaan lijie
 In 1966, in a murder case, the court of Faizabad sentenced Mitrasen Yadav to life imprisonment
 mitrasen yadav ko hoicourt se bhi koi raahat nahin mili
 Mitrasen was sentenced to 6 years in Faizabad jail, but in 1972 an order issued by the government freed the detainee Mitrasen from prison
 mitrasen yadav par hatya kaa yah pehla mukadmaa tha
 But after getting relief, Mitrasen's criminal graph started growing
 ek ke baad ek kai mukademe darj hue
 Gradually, he became the king of the world of crime
 iske baad inhone raajnneeti main kadam rakhaa or rajaypal dwaara kshamaadaan kaa hawala dekar chunaav lade, phir 6 baar vidhayak or 3 baar saansad bhi chune gaye
 The fact that the governor did not forgive his crime, he is not exonerated
 ye sashart jamaanat par reeha hue the or aaj bhi sajayaftaa mujrim hai
 These are still 'gilt hold'
 haa, inaki sajaa ko thodaa kam karke raahat dete hue sashart jamaanat par reeha kiya tha, jabaki ye lagaataar chunaav ayog ko gumraah karte rahe
 He continued to cite the Governor's pardon
 ek baar phir ye chunaav maidan main hai or chunaav ayog ko hi naakaabil sanstha bataate hue kah rahe hai ki ise to sara desh gumraah kar rahaa he
 Even in rhetoric, it is not behind
 
 
 mitrasen yadav ne kaha, 'chunaav ayog ko puraa desh gumraah kar rahaa he
 This is not a worthy institution
 niyam-kanoon se daksh he, desh main bhaashan dene waalon par bhi pratibandh laga de rahaa he
 Why does it not do anything against us, it is all useless
 
 
 'aakhir kya he sach?1972 main shashan dwaara uttar pradesh rajyapal kaa faijabad jail adheekshak ko bheja gaya aadesh patr he, jise aaj tak ne khoj niklaa he
 It refers to Section 401 of the crpc, under which the jail superintendent has been ordered conditionally released to the detainee Mitrasen
 isamen saaf-saaf likhaa gaya he ki mitrasen yadav ke 'dandadesh ke apshisht bhaag kaa parihaar' karte hai or aadesh dete hai ki use avilamb mukt kiya jaae
 But the first condition to release is that the captive will remain at peace for 7 years from the date of his liberation
 use paanch hajaar kii jamaanat deni hogi
 Now Mitrasen continued to become 'honorable' by calling this order as 'pardon'
 rajyapal kaa vah aadesh, jis par mitrasen hue the rihtub yah aadesh patr aaj tak ke haath lag gaya he
 Nowhere is it written in this order letter that they have been absolved
 ye aaj bhi sajayaftaa hai or jamaanat par reeha hai
 But now this letter can put them in trouble
 sawaal yah he ki kya chunaav ayog kisi aise shaks ko chunaav ladane kii anumati de saktaa he, jo sajayaftaa ho
 If not, then how did it keep dust in the eye for so many years? What is its legal aspect
 
 
 abhi iske gunahon se or bhi parade uthaane baaki hai
 In the order letter issued by the Governor, he was released on conditional bail and it was clearly written that he should live peacefully for 7 years from the date of liberation
 iske liye inhone jamaanat bhi di thi, lekin reeha hone ke teen saal baad hi 1975 main inke khilaaf hatya kaa mukadmaa darj ho gaya
 In 2000, the then magistrate Navneet Sehgal complained to the government
 dm ne agrim kaarywahi ke liye nirdesh maanga, lekin shashan ko bheja gaya wo patr bhi satta main oonchi pahunch ke chalate dabaa diya gaya
 Aaj Tak has also found that letter
 isamen jila magistrate, faijabad ne likhaa he ki mitrasen ko saat varshon tak shantipurna dhang se rahanaa tha
 But a case has been filed against them in the police station Inayatnagar
 dm ne shashan se nirdesh maanga tha
 In such a situation, according to law experts, there is a provision to arrest such a person immediately, it is a distant thing to contest elections
 varisht adhivaktaa said khan ke mutabik, siarpisi main 1973 kii pehali dhara 401 main praavdhaan tha ki sarkaar ko kisi bhi apradhi kii sajaa main chhot dene kaa adhikaar he
 Later sections of the law changed
 dhara 432 main kaha gaya ki yadi rajya sarkaar kisi doshasiddh bandi kii sajaaon main chhot dena chaahe, to kuch sharton ke aadhaar par chhot de sakati he
 But the condition of conviction will remain as before, only punishment will be waived
 jo doshasiddh kaa aadesh he, vah barkaraar rahegaa
 If someone does not comply with the conditions, he will be arrested without warrant and will have to be punished for the remaining sentence
 dm kaa patr, jisamen unhone shashan se maanga tha nirdeshmitrasen yadav kii umrakaid kii sajaa to barkaraar he, lekin sajaa main kami karte hue jamaanat par choda gaya he
 In such a case the punishment is waived and the person is kept out on bail, not kept in jail
 sajaa ko simit kiya jaataa he, lekin sajaa ke aadesh ko barkaraar rakhaa jaataa he
 The person will not stay in jail, will be out with some conditions
 chunki rajya sarkaar main rajyapal bhi aate hai, isliye kshamaadaan ke baad bhi doshasiddh kaa aadesh barkaraar rahata he
 Now, in the new CRP, who has been sentenced to life imprisonment under 433A, he can not be released before 14 years, can not get exemption
 climet change ko lekar bharat main log jaagruk to hai lekin wo jaagane ke baad bhi ruke hue hai
 BBC Media Action found this in their survey on Climate Change
 climet change par kiya gaya ye survey asia ke saat deshon main kiya gaya he, or isamen 35,000 logon se raay lee gai he
 This survey has been done to get public opinion on climate change
 is survey main logon ne vaataavaran main aa rahe mahatvapurn badlaavon masalan taapmaana main ijapha, pani kii killat or khaane kii kami jaise muddon ko mahatvapurn mana he
 More than half of the people surveyed in India in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand and Mumbai believe that it is impossible to take any action to deal with climate change
 logon kaa maananaa he ki is climet change kii samasya he to mahatvapurn lekin iskaa samaadhaan uplabdh nahin he lihaaja ham log kuch nahin kar rahe hai
 In BBC Media Action's Climate Asia Survey, 44 per cent of Indians in rural areas believe that farm productivity has declined in the last 10 years and attributed the uncertainty in rainfall
 garib or gramin logon sabase zyada chintaa pani kii killat or duusare tamaam prakritik sansadhano kaa ghatana he
 But there is a complete lack of information about this
 survey main shaamil madhya pradesh ke 17 fisadi logon ko lagata he ki climet change ko lekar unke paas mukammal jaankaree he or khaas baat ye he ki in logon ko aisa nahin lagata he ki vyaktigat rup se unki is maamle main koi jimmedaari banati he
 On the other hand, 74% of the people of Mumbai surveyed are fully aware of climate change and there people are recognizing the need for energy saving and disaster management
 survey main shaamil 90 fisadi logon kaa maananaa he ki climet change kii vajah se unki inakam par asar pad rahaa he
 Despite this, only 30 per cent of the people are talking about a change in their living
 survey main shaamil pachaas fisadi se zyada logon kaa maananaa he ki climet change ke liye kadam uthaane kii jimmedaari unki apni nahin he
 At the same time people want the government to take steps regarding climate change but they are not confident on this
 bibisi media ection kii country diarector priyanka dutt ke mutabik bharat main climet change kii vajah se prabhavit hone vaale logon ko madad pahunchane or jaagruk karne main kaaphi peeche hai
 According to him, civil society, government and media together in India should make people aware of climate change and also tell them what to do for it
 bibisi media ection ke climet asia survey kii lead research prerana kumaar ke mutabik is adhyayan se hamen ye pataa chalata ki bharat main logon kii climet change ko lekar dilchaspee kitni he or wo isko lekar kitne gambhir hai
 According to him, after the survey, it would not be wrong to say that right now we have to do a lot of work about the right information about climate change and all steps to stop it
 soshal media par ek video teji se viral ho rahaa he
 Everyone is surprised to see that

 The entire incident has been captured in CCTV

 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 This is published directly from Syndicate Feed) (NDTV team has not edited this news
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) The level of bitterness between Team India captain Virat Kohli and Anil Kumble had reached so high that if Kumble had got an extension to the post of coach, Kohli would have left the captaincy
 telegraph ne sutron ke hawaale se ye daawa kiya he
 How angry Kohli is about Kumble, it is known from this that he has deleted the tweet from his Twitter handle, which he did as a welcome to Anil Kumble when he became the coach
 kumble ke kaaran captaini chhod dete viraongreji akhbaar da telegraph main sutron ke hawaale se daawa kiya gaya he ki agar kumble ko coach barkaraar rakhaa jaataa, to viraat captaini chhod dete
 With Pakistan's victory at the Oval ground in England on the evening of 18 June, not only India's dream was broken, but also every hope of reconciliation between Kumble and Kohli was shattered
 viraat ke vyavhaar se siesi bhi hairaanyun to kumble or kohli ke sambandhon main beete kuch maheenon se kaaphi khatas chal rahi tha lekin iske baavjood halaat utane kharaab nahin hue ki kohli, kumble ko coach banaae jane par captaini chhodane kii dhamkee de dete
 But it happened
 aisa hua champions trophy ke final mukaable ke agle din yani somvaar ko
 In this meeting held on Monday, Kohli told the CAC members i
e
 Sachin, Sourav and Laxman in clear terms that if Kumble remains the coach, then Kohli will not be able to captain
 kohli ke in tewaron se siesi ke sadsy bhi hairaan the
 There was talk of a rift between the coach and the captain for a long time
 champions trophy kii haar ne aag main 'ghi' kaa kaam kiyasabhi ko ummid thi ki maamla sulajh jayega
 In the hope that the board had also booked tickets for Kumble and his wife with Team India for the tour of the West Indies
 somvaar ko siesi ke saath hui kohli kii jis meeting ne bhartiya cricket main bhuuchaal laa diya uski patakatha ek din pehle yani champions trophy main haar ke baad hi likh gai thi
 According to reports, Kumble reprimanded the entire team in the dressing room of the team after the defeat in the final
 apane puure kariyar main anushaasan ke saath cricket khilne vaale kumble ke liye yah team ke liye ek jaruri sabak ho saktaa tha lekin super star kaa darja paa chuke team india ke cricketron ke liye yah daant aisi thi jaise koi skool master apane chaatro ko lagaataa ho
 Contrary to Kumble's advice after the toss, Sunday evening proved to be the last nail in the coffin of the already running relationship between the captain and coach
 mana ja rahaa he ki kumble bharat pakistan ke final mukaable main toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji kaa faisla chaahate the lekin kohli ne maidan par iske ulat faisla kiya
 Kohli said to the CAC 'I will give up the captaincy'
 Kohli's meeting with the CAC made it clear that Kumble was violating the boundary line of the rights of the coach and the captain and did not want to become the captain without authority
 yani saaf tha ki agar kumble coach rahenge to kohli captaini chhod denge
 If you feel that this is some kind of joke, then tell it is not like that at all

 Voting for the Jokihat Assembly by-election has started at 7 am on Monday
 subah se hi vot daalane ke liye matdaan kendron par logon kii lambii line dekhne ko mil rahi hai
 The main reason for this is that Jokihat has a Muslim population of more than 70 percent and because of the month of Ramadan, voters want to exercise their right to vote in the morning
 jokihat vidhansabha upachunaavake raajnneetik myne kii baat karen to yah seat 2005 se lagaataar chaar baar jadyu ke paas rahaa he
 In such a situation, winning the Jokihat election remains a nose question for Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 jadyu ne is baar jokihat se murshid alam ko tikat diya he, lekin unke upar balaatkaar, hatya or lut ke kai aaropon ne unke khilaaf ilaake main maahaul banaaya he jiskaa phayda argedy uthaanaa chaah rahi he
 RJD has given ticket to Shahnawaz Alam, the younger son of RJD MP Taslimuddin, for snatching this seat from JDU
 party kii ummid he ki 70 phisadi muslim matadaataaon kaa phayda unhen milegaa or saath hi taslimuddin ke naam par unhen sahanbhuti vot bhi milenge
 More than JDU vs RJD, this battle has become more about Abneetish vs Tejaswiyadava
 jokihat jeetna nitish ke liye jitna jaruri he utana hi jaruri tejasvi yadav ke liye bhi jaruri he
 Nitish Kumar's defeat at Jokihat will further emphasize that the Muslim voters who once joined Nitish Kumar are against him now
 isaki mukhya vajah yah he ki muslim matadaataaon main is baat ko lekar behad naaraazgi he ki nitish ne pichley saal argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav ko dhokhaa dekar bhaajapa ke saath sarkaar bana lee
 On the other hand, the victory in Jokihat will once again prove that the Muslim voters are together even though they are with the BJP
 tejasvi yadav ke liye jokihat main jeet kaa matlab hoga party main naa keval unka kad badhanaa balki yah sandesh bhi jayega ki tejasvi yadav nitish kumaar ko takkar de sakate hai, jiskaa phayda unhen 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main mil saktaa he
 The election victory will bring Tejashwi Yadav to a standstill equivalent to Nitish Kumar
 chunavi jeet se yah bhi sabit hoga ki tejasvi yadav apane dam par jadyu ke seat ko chin sakate hai
 Arvind Kejriwal is the second Chanakya of Team Anna

 The whole country stands united against corruption, yes, this anger arising in the general public was understood by Arvind Kejriwal, a member of Team Anna

 Let us tell you that Arvind Kejriwal got the post of Income Tax Joint Commissioner by becoming IRS by qualifying Civil Services in 1992 and realized the extent to which corruption has spread and he decided to launch a movement against corruption
 kejariwal ne janvari 2000 main bhrashtachar ko mitaane ke liye parivartan naam kii ek sanstha kaayam kii
 In 2006, Kejriwal quit the job and became completely involved with the change
 ab kejariwal kaa naam kisi ke liye anjaan nahin he, or anna hazaare ke saath unka naam anna ke mukhya salaahkaar ke taur par judaa he
 Anna and Kejriwal along with the core members of civil society were arrested and sent to Tihar Jail before taking the fast on August 16
 anna ke kisi bhi faisle main kejariwal sabase aage rahete hai
 Kejriwal's specialty is that he understands policy corruption very well
 saath hi kejariwal bhrashtachar ke khilaaf bane adhiniim artiai yani rhite tu information se bhi jude hai
 It is said about Arvind Kejriwal that he first wanted to do social service by becoming a doctor but some of his friends said that the seats in medical are less
 ejineering main zyaada hoti hai to unhone iaiti ko chunaa
 After engineering from IIT Kharagpur, Kejriwal qualified UPSC for the first time but his destination was not because his life was the aim of social service
 ab koi bhi andaaza laga saktaa he ki aaj civil sosayadi yani team anna kyon is kadar majboot he
 Why Anna's movement against corruption is becoming a people's movement

 Also, children do not make any mistake when asked questions, so they were also crammed like parrots
 ain maukey par mukhyamantri kaa skool aane kaa kaarykram radd ho gaya
 As soon as the students of the school got a glimpse of it, the new bags distributed to the children were snatched away from them
 ab bacchon ko phir puraane khastahal baston ko lekar hi skool janaa pad rahaa he
 The interesting thing is that these old settlements can be seen written with the photo of former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav - 'read a lot, read a lot'

 The second match of the four-match Test series between the cricket teams of India and England will be played from Friday at Trent Bridge ground in Nottingham
 is match ke jariye bhartiya team joardaar vaapasi karnaa chaahegi kyonki ek or haar se uski aage kii raah bahut mushkil ho jaaegi
 There is no doubt that when captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team takes the field at Trent Bridge, then its main goal will be to make a spectacular comeback by forgetting the Lord's crushing defeat as it will lose the crown of the highest seeded Test team
 ek varsh se bhi adhik samay se is taj par apana haq banaae rakhane vaali bhartiya team se ise hasil karne ke liye english team ko is siries main kam se kam 2-0 se jeet kii darkaar he
 She has done half of her work with a 196-run win at Lord's and will intend to repeat the Lord's performance at Trent Bridge
 lords kii haar bhartiya team ke liye ek sabak kii tarah he lekin team ke andar ke halaat bahut adhik nahin badale hai
 Zaheer Khan is still injured
 captain dhoni saaf kar chuke hai ki vah kisi ek match ke liye jahir kii fitness se samjhauta karnaa nahin chahenge
 Shantakumaran Sreesanth gets a chance in Zaheer's absence
 spin vibhaag main harbhajan singh kii 'nishkriyata' mejabaanon ko raas aa rahi he lekin dhoni isse pareshaan hai
 Bhajji has been an important player for a long time and due to this Dhoni would not like to risk trying Amit Mishra in a hurry
 gautam gambhir fisenheen hai
 They are also not playing in this match
 abhinav mukund ke paas anubhav kii kami he, lihaaja bhartiya salaami ballebaajon se acchhee shuruyaat kii ummid bemaani hogi
 Rahul Dravid will start the innings
 vaise suresh raina ne kaaphi had tak apni bhoomika ke saath nyaay kiya tha lekin sachin isamen naakaam rahe
 There is no longer any specific discussion about his 100th century
 aise main sachin ke paas bina dabaav ke khelte hue yah mukaam hasil karne kaa acha mauka he
 Sachin, Dravid and Laxman have performed better than the first match in the second Test match of any series
 kul milakar bharat kaa record bhi is lihaaj se behatar rahaa he
 India made a strong comeback through the second Test match in the overseas tours and also won the series on several occasions
 2002 ke england daure main bharat saurav ganguli kii captaini main khelte hue lords main khelaa gaya pehla test match haar gaya tha
 He then held the English team at Trent Bridge to equalize and then won at Headingley to level the three-match series
 lords kii haar ke baad bhartiya team ko abhyaas ke liye sirf teen dinon kaa vakt mila lekin jitna bhi vakt mila, usne uskaa bharpoor phayda uthaaya
 So while Indian players know that Zaheer as well as Virender Sehwag will return to the team for the third Test and their arrival will increase the strength of the team many times, obviously the players are very strong in Trent Bridge regarding their strong aspects
 Would like to try duusare test main galatiyon ke liye koi jagah nahin kyonki ek or haar bharat ke haath se na sirf sarvocch variyata praapt team kaa taj chin legi balki iske baad us par siries main haar bachaane kaa dabaav aa jayega kyonki do maichon ke shesh rahete jeet kii koi ummid nahin rah jaaegi

 "it said," The decision on Perth was probably due to uneven bounce, which twice hurt batsmen
 ’ isisi ne is saal kii shuruyaat main maidan or pich kii gunvattta main sudhaar karne ke liye bahut acha, acha, ausat, ausat se kam or kharaab reating dena shuru kiya he
 The website claimed that the Adelaide Oval pitch, which hosted the first Test, received a 'very good' rating
 johnson ne twitor par likhaa ,‘pich main koi kharabi nahin thi
 It was nice seeing the battle between the bat and the ball
 aam taur par bejaan sapaat pichen dekhne ko milti hai
 i want to know what is a good pitch
 ummid he ki emsiji par bhi test romaanchak hoga
 'nothing wrong with it
 It was exciting to watch a contest between bat and ball for a change and not these dull flat tracks being served up constantly
 I'd actually be interested in knowing what a good pitch is? Hope for another exciting test at the MCG 🏏https: / / t

 dilli vishvavidhyalay main angreji bhashaa ke shikshakon ne 2
 Changing the subject with 5 per cent points has raised questions
 ve chaahate hai ki ise kam se kam angreji ke liye jarur sudhaar liya janaa chahie
 The rules adopted by Delhi University for English (hons) course in the year 2015 have been changed
 jisaki vajah se skool main manviki kii padhai karne vaale chaatro ko darkinar kiye jane kii ashanka he
 Last year, DU applied for English (hons) 2 in the four-best subjects for candidates
 5 fisad uniform point kaa maanak tay kiya tha
 Because of this, students of all streams could apply in these courses
 isamen ummidavaar bina kisi penalty va baraabar cat of par applai kar sakate the
 Rudrashish Chakraborty, a teacher of English at Kirori Mal College, says that to apply for the Humanities stream in English (hons) subjects, either have to score or more than commerce-science candidates
 is puure maamle par dilli vishvavidhyalay main angreji shikshika sanam khanna kahati hai ki is policy kii vajah se claces kaa maahaul, baatcheet karne kaa andaaj or asinaments sabamit karne kii style bhi badali he, haalanki vah iske liye semester system ko bhi jimmevaar tehraati hai
 Apart from this, she says that students coming to English from Science and Commerce have no idea what they are going to face
 unhen lambey-lambey uttar likhane kii aadat nahin hoti, ve tathyon par aadhaarit padhai ke aadi hote hai or ve kadam-dar-kadam nirdesh kii apeksha rakhte hai
 At the same time, she says that this policy gives an advantage to students studying elective English but their number is very less and that is why they are sidelined
 kapil sharma ke aaropon ke baadaam aadmi partiaravind kejariwal ke paksh main khadi najar aa rahi he
 Party MLA Som Bharti in the case says that no one can believe the manner in which Kapil Mishra has made allegations
 is babat unke paas koi saboot bhi nahin hai
 Another such incident occurred in the same country
 karnan kii tarah kapil mishra bhi party ke andar harakat kar rahe hai
 it's not a big deal
 unhone kaha ki is desh ke andar ek alternetr politics kii shuruaservind kejarivalane kii he
 Opponents also do not believe in corruption charges against him
 kapil ke aaropon par bijepi ho yaa phir congress koi bhi yakeen nahin kar paa rahaa he
 Everything is fine and more charges can be leveled, but these allegations are no reality
 kapil mishra ke mantri pad se hataane ke sawaal par somnath bharti kaa kahana he ki pani ko lekar samasyaayein aa rahi thim
 The party also had to bear the brunt of this in the elections
 isko lekar shikaayatein aa rahi thim
 There was a water problem in my area too
 bharti ne kaha, 'maine kai barkejariwal or kapilse kaha ki mujhe pani ko lekar shikaayatein mil rahi hai
 Problems have to be raised, but it is also true that the ministry of which Kapil was a minister has done many historical works
 chunaav vaale maheene main pani ko lekar kaaphi takalif hui thi
 The legislators also had to face these troubles at the ground level
 iske chalate chunaav buree tarah prabhavit hua
 He said that the party suffered heavily due to mismanagement of the water ministry
 somnath bharti kaa kahana he ki mantralay se hataa diya, to koi badi baat nahin he
 What is kept in the ministry? Such ministries can be done for the country, but they have taken it to heart
 unako kya hua he? kiske haath main vah khel rahe hai? samaj main nahin aa rahaa he? ab BJP ko haath dhone kaa mauka mil rahaa he
 This is unfortunate and painful
 jaanch ke sawaal par somnath bharti kaa kahana he ki jitani bhi jaanch agenciyaan he, sabhi centre sarkaar ke niyantran main hai
 Be it CBI, Delhi Police or ED or Income Tax or Delhi Anti Corruption Branch
 aise main kejariwal ke khilaaf jaanch se koun roak rahaa he
 He said that ACB has also said that Kapil Mishra has no evidence

 US President Donald Trump has announced his withdrawal from the nuclear deal with Iran
 2015 main iran or chah vaishvik shaktiyon ke bich hue is parmaanu samjhaute se america kaa nikalnaa bharat ke liye bhi musiibat khadi kar saktaa he
 Especially on the prices front of petrol and diesel
 dikhne laga he asalmerica ke raashtrapati donald trump ke iran parmaanu samjhaute se alag hone kaa asar dikhne bhi laga he
 Brent crude prices have reached close to $ 77 internationally after this decision
 trump ke faisle ke baad isamen 2
 There has been an increase of 5 percent
 2014 ke baad brent crude pehali baar itane oonche str par pahunchaa he
 At the same time, when it comes to WPI crude, it has also crossed $ 75 per barrel
 yah bhi 2014 ke baad apane sabase oonche str par he
 What will be the impact on India? After Donald Trump's decision, the increase in crude oil prices is believed to be certain
 haalanki tel company ke ek adhikari kaa maananaa he ki america ke is kadam kaa turant asar bharat par nahin padegaa
 According to him, crude oil imported from Iran to India will not be affected until European countries also stand with the US
 turant nahin hoga koi prabhavasamachar agency pitiai se baat karte hue indian oil corporation (IOC) ke nideshak (vitt) eke sharma ne bataaya ki bharat apni tel aapurti ke liye bhugtan euro main karata he
 For this he uses the European banking channel
 unka kahana he ki jab tak ye raste band nahin hote, tab tak yues ke is kadam ke asar se bharat achoota rah saktaa he
 But due to this, the troublemaker said that we have to keep an eye on the situation
 agar europea desh pehle kii sthiti banaae rakhte hai, to iran se bharat ko hone vaali tel kii aapurti pehle kii tarah hoti rahegi
 But if European countries also stand with America
 ye desh banking channel ko band kar sakate hai or iran ke saath vittiya len dein par pratibandh laga sakate hai
 In such a situation, it will be difficult for India to pay Iran for the purchase of oil
 kachche tel kii badhegi keemteniraq or saudi arab ke baad iran bharat kaa teesraa sabase bada oil saplir he
 In the first 10 months of fiscal year 2017-18, Iran gave India 1
 84 karod ton kaccha tel diya tha
 This figure is between April 2017 to January 2018
 lekin agar europea desh bhi america kii raah chalate hai, to kachche tel ko lekar bharat kaa ganit gadabada saktaa he
 On the other hand, the situation will worsen further due to reduced supply of crude oil from Iran
 pehle hi venezuela main paidaa hue aarthik sankat ke chalate kachche tel kii keemton main badhottaree jari he
 Petrol and diesel prices will increase Due to increase in crude oil prices, the prices of petrol and diesel have already reached the sky

 It is believed that no changes are being made due to the Karnataka elections
 haalanki kachche tel kii badhati keemton kii vajah se sarkaar ke saamne nayaa aarthik sankat paidaa ho saktaa he
 Its impact on the rupee is clearly visible

 With this, they will get a chance to bathe in the Marich Kund located in the temple
 aisi manyata he ki mukteshwar mandir ke paas sthit marich kunda se snaan karne par nisantan logon ko santan kii prapti hoti he
 With this belief, a childless couple spent 41 thousand rupees for taking the first bath after midnight
 is snaan kii baqayda boli lagi
 The biggest bidders were Mugdha Mohanty and Shailendu Mohanty of Khurd district in Odisha
 darasal is kunda se pehla snaan dharmik prayojanon ke liye hota he
 After this, the second bath is spoken
 duusari sabase badi boli ranjita or vishwanath naam ke jode ne lagaai
 They bid for Rs 11,500
 sutron kii maane to is saal boli lagane kii nunatam rakam 14,500 rupee tay kai gai thi
 The entire bidding process took place in the presence of policemen and members of the temple administration
 boli kii prakriya jeetne vaali mahila ne usee raat kunda main snaan kiya
 She hoped that she would hear the good news of getting pregnant the same night
 mahila ne kaha, 'har saal yahaan hajaaron nisantan log aate hai
 Everyone benefits, i hope my lap will also be filled
 ' The finger is being pointed at the closure of the Chief Minister Health Insurance Scheme after the death of a woman in Uttarakhand
 is mahila ko hariddhar road sthit jagdamba troma centre main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 Shortly before this trauma center was inaugurated by CM Trivendra Singh Rawat
 parijanon kaa aarope he ki agar hospital prashasan mukhyamantri swasthya beemaa yojana emesbiwai card ko samay se panch kar letaa, to unke marij kii jaan batch jaati
 After the death of the patient, seeing the uproar of the family members, DM Dehradun, ACMO Dr
 keke singh ko maamle kii jaanch soup di he
 Along with this, the family has also given a complaint against the hospital management in Nehru Colony police station
 gauratlab he ki swasthya vibhaag khud mukhyamantri trivand singh ravat sambhaal rahe hai
 Therefore, due to the closure of such a big scheme in which lakhs of poor people of the state are directly connected, the functioning of the government is getting a finger on it
 abhi bhi hazaron kii sankhya main is yojana se jude mariz puure pradesh main apana ilaaj karwaane ke liye bhartee hai, par yojana band hone ke baad ab sabakaa jivan ram bharose hi he, kyonki paisa unke paas he nahin or mukhyamantri swasthya beemaa yojana band ho chuki he
 CM is talking about providing better health care to the remote areas of the state, but the death of a patient due to lack of money in the state capital Dehradun is not a good sign at all
 mukhyamantri swasthya beemaa yojana ke tahat ilaaj na milane ke kaaran patelnagar ilaake main sthit brahmpuri ward nivasee 60 varshiya kamala devi ne apni jaan ganvaa di
 Ambulance was not given to go to the dead body
 In fact, 60-year-old Kamla Devi was admitted to the Jagdamba Trauma Center on Haridhar Road on November 9 with the help of Ambulance 108
 mahila ke paas emesbiwai card hone ke baavjood jagdamba troma centre marij ko bhartee karaane se anakani karne laga
 The woman died at around 8 am on Saturday
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki hospital prashasan maut kaa kaaran horntac bataa rahaa he, jabaki ilaaj kar rahe doctor ko pataa hi nahin he ki maut kis vajah se hui
 After death, neither the ambulance hospital nor the Uttarakhand government's service provided it to carry the body
 lihaaja ek tempo main hi laash ko parijan apane ghar le gaye
 Congress protested, after the incident came to the fore, Uttarakhand Congress got an issue sitting
 asal main yah yojana harish ravat sarkaar ke dauraan shuru hui thi or ise trivendra sarkaar main band kar diya gaya
 Uttarakhand vice-president Suryakant Dhasmana, who reached the spot, blamed the Trivend government solely for the incident
 is yojana ke band hone kii vajah se ye maut pehali jarur he, lekin aage aisi ghatnaon se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki beemaa karne vaali company ne ab haath khadey kar die hai or sarkaar ke paas aashwaasan dene ke alaava abhi kuch nahin
 Shiv Sena accepted the accusation of former BJP leader Sudhindra Kulkarni as a grandson of black ink
 saath hi ise deshbhakti se bhi jod diya
 Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP and party spokesman Sanjay Raut said that it is the blood of the people, not the ink
 raut ne raut ne kaha ki 'ye log buddhijivi kasaab hai
 It was a mild reaction
 shivasainikon ne jo kiya he wo deshbhakti ke liye unki pratikriya he
 If we show a reaction against the people of Pakistan, the message will go in Pakistan
 hamane kisi ko aadesh nahin diya he
 This is all natural reaction
 'tab bhi kii thi aisi hi batenisase pehle pakistani ghazal gayak gulam ali kaa sho radd hone ke baad bhi party ne kaha tha ki pakistan ke gupt or kyrana hamalon main shahid hue bhartiya javaanon ko shivasena ne shradhanjali di he

 The Shiv Sena had threatened to cancel the event
 lekin kulkarni ne is kaarykram ko radd karne se manaa kar diya tha
 After this, on Monday morning, some people surrounded him and surrounded him and gave him a black ink vessel
 unhone ise bina saaf kiye hi press conference bhi kii
 At a press conference with Kasukulkarni, Kasuri said after the release of the book that neither i was a minister during the Kargil war nor during the 26 / 11 attacks
 pakistan ke log bharat ke saath achche rishte chaahate hai

 cobra vaise to kai sanpon ko nigalane kii kshamta rakhata he
 But what happens when he encounters a dragon
 singapore main aisi ek ladaai dekhne ko mili he
 a person has shared the video of both of them on social media
 isamen saaf dikh rahaa he ki ek baari-bharkam cobra ajgar kii ore dhire-dhire sarak rahaa he lekin khatre kii aahat sunate hi ajgar bhi hamale ke liye taiyaar ho jaataa he
 The cobra thinks that the creature in front will be a small creature and he bites the teeth in the tail of the dragon as soon as he sees the opportunity
 lekin ajgar bhi bachaav main hamalaa kar detaa he
 At this point, the cobra also feels that it is not empty of danger to confront the front
 uskaa saamana usee ke takkar vaale saanp se ho gaya he
 The cobra runs away from there, looking at the opportunity
 tippaniyan At the same time you can see in a second video how a cobra swallows another snake and spews when it cannot digest it
 is video ko record karne vaale utyub yujar christopher renolds likhte hai, 'main or meri patni apni maa ke yahaan se nikle the ki tabhi meri najar is saanp par padi
 Then i parked my car and so that i can draw some pictures of it
 or jo unhone record kiya wo shaayad ab tak kaa sabase vahiyaat lekin phir bhi dilachasp footage he
 This video was uploaded on 28 April
 isamen dikh rahaa he ki kaale rang kaa ek vishaal saanp khud se chote ek saanp ko ugal rahaa he
 The more surprising thing in this is that this snake that came out of his mouth is still alive
 vahiin aap ek duusare video main dekh sakate hai ki ek cobra kaise ek duusare saanp ko nigal letaa he or jab use pachaa nahin paata he to ugal detaa he
 youtube user Christopher Reynolds, who recorded the video, writes, "I and my wife came out of my mother's place when i got my eye on this snake
" tab maine apni gaadi peeche kii or taaki isaki kuch tasviren khinch sakuun
 And what he recorded is probably the most epic yet interesting footage
 yah video 28 april ko aplod kiya gaya he
 It is seen that a huge black snake is spewing a snake smaller than itself
 isamen zyada chakit karne vaali jo baat he vah yah ki uske munh se niklaa yah saanp ab bhi jinda he

 # khiljia post shared by Ranveer Singh (@ranveersingh) on Nov 4, 2017 at 3:44am PDT a heartbreaking incident has surfaced in Hoskote, about 45 kilometers from Bangalore
 eent banane vaali ek factory kii car shed main guuruuvaar shaam 8 saal kii ek bacchee kii laash mili
 Polythene was punched in his mouth so that he could not scream
 police ke mutabik bacchee ke saath rape ke baad hatya kii vaardaat ko anjaam diya gaya
 a shop in front of the mauka-e-varadat had a CCTV camera installed
 police ne jab sisitivi footage khangala, to puri vaardaat footage main silsilewar dhang se maujuud mili
 Footage shows that a 40-year-old man takes a girl playing nearby to a car shed
 kuch der baad vah apana kapadaa thik karte hue baahar nikalataa dikhataa he
 In addition to Hoskote, SP Abdul Ahad claimed that the accused would be arrested soon with the help of CCTV footage
 bacchee ke mata-pita uttari karnataka ke rahane vaale hai or hoscote main lagi factory main pichley ek saal se majdoor ke taur par kaam kar rahe hai
 Article 370 caused corruption in Kashmir, 40 thousand people were killed: Devendra Fadnavis will be the bjp's victory in Shahmaharashtra elections Chief Minister: Shahghar Minister Shah: Janta will respect sc's decision on Ram temple issue after Article 370 is removed from Jammu and Kashmir Central Home Minister Amit Shah, in his first interview to India Today, gave an unimpressed opinion on various issues
 anuchhed 370 ke itihaas main banane ke baad apane pehle saakshaatkaar main amit shah ne kashmir main hinsa kii khabaron ko khaarij kar diya or kaha ki jammu-kashmir bahut shantipurna he
 Incidentally, Shah's statement came on the day that postpaid mobile services were restored in the valley after 70 days of lockdown
 grih mantri ne 40,000 logon kii hatyaon ke liye anuchhed 370 ko bhi jimmedaar tehraaya
 Amit Shah said, “after the end of Article 370 there is no curfew anywhere
 keval chah police stesan kshetron main dhara 144 lagaai gai he
 The apple business is running smoothly
 sadakon par yatayaat he or bazaar bhi dhire-dhire phir se khul rahe hai
 Overall condition is good
 log shuukravaar kii namaaj adaa karne ke liye masjid ja rahe hai
 There is peace in both the Jammu and Kashmir division
 mobile sevaayen or wais kol bhi phir se shuru ho gai hai
 "leaders are in preventive custody
 When they were asked that if everything is fine in Kashmir, then why were former Chief Ministers Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti kept in lockup?" On this, the Home Minister said, when an incident is fresh, the act of provocation is not right
 370 hataae jane ke baad 4 hajaar logon ko ehtiyaat ke taur par hiraasat main liya gaya
 Of that, less than 1 thousand are in jail today
 inamen se 800 patharbaj hai
 On Farooq Abdullah, Amit Shah said that there is no restriction on him
 na to chif secretary, thanedaar or na hi kisi or kii ore se
 He was not under house arrest
 jab poocha gaya ki umr abdulla or mahabuuba mufti par bhi roak he to grih mantri ne mana ki vah philhal public sefti act (piese) ke tahat house arest main hai
 Drawing the road map of Kashmir, Amit Shah said, the Congress which is making a stir in two and a half months, kept Sheikh Abdullah in captivity for 11 years
 kashmir par vikaas ke aage ke road map par amit shah ne kaha, 370 ke kaaran jammu-kashmir main vikaas nahin ho paaya tha, bhrashtachar kaaphi hua
 No one was responsible for this
 370 hatane ke baad ab vahaan neeche tak vikaas pahonchega
 When Amit Shah was asked if 370 was removed, it was said that there would be stonewalling, there would be tremendous opposition and terrorist attack but there were difficulties but not much opposition was seen
 is par unhone kaha, sansad main kaha gaya tha ki dange nahin raktapaat hoga
 The people of Jammu and Kashmir had nothing to do with 370
 kuch netaaon kaa hi swaarth isse judaa tha
 He said that the world was in favor of India for the removal of 370 and believed that this is India's internal issue
 unhone ise narendra modi sarkaar kii badi kootnithik jeet bataaya
 Devendra Fadnavis will become Chief Minister During the interview, Amit Shah said that the next Chief Minister of Maharashtra will be Devendra Fadnavis
 darasal unase poocha gaya tha ki bijepi apana alag prachaar karti he or shivasena apana
 The Shiv Sena says that the next chief minister will be his party
 is par shah ne ashankaon ke tamaam badal hataate hue log pehle kehete the ki shivasena hamaare saath nahin aegi, aa gai
 We contested, won
 phir se hamaara gathbandhan ho gaya or devendra fadanvis hi siem honge
 NRC will be implemented across the country Amid the ongoing debate over the National Citizenship Register (NRC) in the country, Home Minister Amit Shah has said that it will be implemented across the country
 assam main NRC lagu kiye jane ke baad pehali baar kisi channel ko die apane saakshaatkaar main shah ne kaha ki narendra modi kii sarkaar kaa ek charitra he
 He said that we definitely do what we say
 uchit samay aane par ham deshbhar main enarasi lagu karenge
 We will also bring Citizen Bill
 ayodhya par faisle ko janata sweekaar karegiram mandir ko lekar supreme court ke faisle par amit shah ne kaha ki is desh kii janata ram mandir ke maamle par sarvocch adaalat ke faisle ko sammaan ke saath sweekaar karegi
 i am confident that both communities will accept this decision and there will be a peaceful solution to the problem
 kya pati-patni kii soch milani chahieh shahvitt mantrinirmala sitaramanake pati ke bhartiya arthvyavastha kii kharaab haalat ko lekar aalochana kiye jane par amit shah ne kaha ki kya aap chaahate hai ki pati kii soch patni kii soch se milanaa hi chahie
 This is a bad idea
 vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ke pati or andhra pradesh sarkaar ke purv sanchaar salaahkaar parakala prabhakar ne ek angreji akhbaar main lekh likhakar kaha tha ki bhartiya arthvyavastha kii haalat kharaab he or ise sudhaarney ke liye sarkaar ko jaruri kadam uthaane chahie
 The government has not been able to present any roadmap to deal with this crisis
 'mujh par encounter kaa cese farji'daagi netaaon ke liye sharansthali ban gai he bijepi, ke sawaal par amit shah ne kaha ki agar koi party badalata he to uskaa main swaagat karata hum
 But if people choose then we welcome them
 unhone kaha ki chunaav ke vakt dal-badal karnaa itnaa bhi bura nahin hota
 i do not consider the pre-mandate change as wrong
 hindi pattee ke teen pramukh rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi kii haar ke peeche ek vajah essi-asti act par janata kii naaraazgi ko bhi mana ja rahaa he
 In this case, it can be said that the BJP did not get Maya Ram, because on one hand the upper caste got angry with him, on the other hand, it did not get much support from the SC-ST class as well
 gauratlab he ki essi-asti act par centre sarkaar ke adhyadesh laane se madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh ke savarna voter kaaphi naaraaz the
 The Supreme Court, while making changes in the SC-ST Act, said that no arrest would be made immediately in its cases, but the Central Government overturned it by bringing an ordinance
 empi main to jagah-jagah iske khilaaf pradarshan bhi hua jo kaaphi hinsak rup le gaya
 The situation became so bad that slippers were thrown at Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 jan aashirwad yatra ke dauraan unke upar pathar phenke gaye the or kaale jhande dikhaae gaye the
 The slippers were opposed to the SC / ST Act
 yah ghatana madhya pradesh ke sidhi jile kii thi
 To calm this anger, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan said that no one will be arrested in Madhya Pradesh without investigation under the SC-ST Act
 apni jan aashirwad yatra ke dauraan chouhan ne yah bhi kaha ki vah madhya pradesh main essi-asti act kaa durupyog nahin hone denge
 But it was of little use
 apano kaa nishanisaki vajah se bijepi vipakshi dalon ke nishane par to he hi, party ke bheetar bhi uske khilaaf awaajen uthati dikhaai de rahi hai
 BJP MLA Surendra Singh from up's Bairia assembly constituency has blamed the SC-ST Act for the party's poor performance in the 5 state assembly elections
 unhone kaha he ki bijepi ko yah haar essi-asti act kii vajah se mili he
 He said that amendment of SC-ST Act was suicidal decision of the government
 ek anumaan ke anusaar madhya pradesh main anusuchit jati kii aabaadi 15
 2 per cent, and Scheduled Tribe population 20
 8 fisadi he
 The state has 35 Scheduled Castes seats, out of which 28 were held by BJP earlier
 isi prakaar 47 anusuchit janajati bahul siton main se 32 par bijepi kaa kabja tha
 Talking about Rajasthan, in 2013, BJP won 49 out of 58 seats fixed for SC / ST
 is baar congress ne 31 jiti hai
 The upper caste voters of the state are angry with the bill brought by the Center in the SC / ST Act
 is par hinsa bhi hui thi
 BJP suffered only due to this
 chhattisgarh main to anusuchit jati-janajatiyon ke vot kaa bada hissaa he, lekin jis tarah se raman singh sarkaar kaa supada saaf hua he, usase saaf he ki is varg kaa bhi samarthan party ko nahin mila
 It is believed that the upper castes were angry at the SC-ST Act and due to this, a lot of votes of the upper castes went against the BJP in all three states
 badi sankhya main naaraaz matadaataaon ne nota par bhi vot daal die jiskaa aakhirkaar bijepi ko hi nuksaan hua he
 On the other hand, the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe votes also went largely to the Congress in the three states
 yah varg paramparaagat taur par congress kaa voter rahaa he, lekin pichley kuch chunaavon se bijepi ko bhi is varg ke vot acchhee taadaad main mil rahe the
