 com / ndq3xkrqli— England Cricket (@ecb_cricket)january 30, 2015 Defense Minister AK Antony gave a strong message to 'wrongdoers' and warned that 'all the hardest possible action' will be taken against those involved in corruption
 antni ne sainya cmanderon ke sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue yahaan kaha ki main aap sabase anurodh karuunga ki nijee vyavhaar kaa ucchtam maanak or din pratidin ke kaary main peshewar eemaandaaree barte
 He said that i would like to emphasize that no act of corruption will be forgiven and that we will take the strongest possible action against anyone who has done wrong
 film:welcome tu karachidiarector:ashish aar mohanster cast:arshad varsi, jaiki bhaganani , lauren gotliruvadhi:132 minutesrtificate:u / aretimga:2 stardiarector ashish aar mohan ne rohit shetty ke saath assistant diarector ke taur par kai filmon main kaam karne ke baad apni pehali film 'khilaadi number 786 ' diarect kii thi or uske baad 'welcome tu karachi' ek nirdeshak ke rup main ashish kii duusari film he
 This time Ashish has tried to tell a unique story with Arshad Warsi and Jackie Bhagnani, will it meet the audience standard, let's review it, first of all, know what the story is
 ye kahani do doston shammi (arshad varsi) or kedaar patel(jaiki bhaganani ) kii he, jo jamnagar (gujarat) main rahete hai
 Work for the same man
 unke paas ek boat he, jo shaadiyon main dijati he
 Shammi is the captain and keeper of the boat
 kedaar kaa sapana hota he america jane kaa jiske jugad ke liye kabhi wo apana sarnem badal letaa he to kabhi vija ke liye jugat ladaata he
 Then Shammi and Kedar plan that after working both of them will leave America from the boat
 kinhi vajahon se boat dub jaati he or kinare par pahunchate hi inhen lagata he ki ye america pahunch gaye hai lekin donon karachi pahunch jate hai
 Then there are many incidents which are full of comedy as well as stupidity
 or aakhirkaar in donon kaa makasad ho jaataa he kisi tarah se bharat waapas pahunch jaaen
 Now whether they are able to come back, it is known only after watching the film
 script, acting or sangitscript kii soch to kaaphi sahi he lekin majaak kii nirantarata ko banaae rakhana kaaphi ahm kaam tha, jo kii film nahin ho paaya he
 Before the interval, the film can be enjoyed with laughter jokes, but after that anything happens and at one point of time we start asking ourselves, 'what the hell is happening'
 haalanki diarector ne kuch real shots ko prayog main laane kii koshish kii he jo kii rikt sthaan kii purti karne main upyukt rahete hai
 Talking about acting, Jackie Bhagnani's performance is much better than the previous films and the urge to play the Gujarati character is seen in his face and acting
 arshad varsi ko jitna prayog main laayaa ja saktaa tha shaayad uskaa 40 fisadi hi upyog main aayaa he
 Arshad could have been given more screen space
 film main ISI kii agent bani abhinetri lauren gotlib kaa kirdaar thodaa shuru main or thodaa aakhir main dikhaai detaa he jisko nibhaane kaa bharsak prayaas unhone kiya he
 The songs of the film are quite good but if some songs were reduced then the pace of the film would have looked a bit better
 khaas taur se 'shakira' geet jo kii dream sikvence main aata he ,usko chota kiya ja saktaa tha
 To see why, to watch this film, you have to keep your mind at home and enter the theater
 agar aisa sambhav he to jarur is film ko dekhie
 If you are a fan of Jackie Bhagnani, Lauren Gottlieb, then you can watch this film and if you are a fan of Arshad Warsi, then you might not get the performance you want
 kyon naa dekhegar aap puure paisa vasuul film kii talash main hai
 So this film is not made for you

 rigerv bank of india (arabiai) ke governor pad se raghuram rajan ke jane ke baad bharat main bed bank laane ke idia par phir se vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 a senior government official has given information about this
 raghuram rajan ke jane ke baad 6 sitambar ko urjit patel ibiai ke nae governor ban gaye the
 Rajan was against the idea of 'bad bank'
 indian express main chhapi khabar ke mutabik nae governor ke aane ke baad bed bank ko laane par vichaar kiya ja saktaa he, jiske jariye karj main fanse bank apni deytaon ko bed bank ko sthanantarit kar paaenge
 Steps can be taken soon
 The officer said, 'some steps can be taken in this direction in the next two to three months
 ab kyonki arabiai ke nae governor aa gaye hai to isaki sambhaavna bad gai he
 The previous RBI governor was not interested in the idea of recovering money through Bad Bank and Asset Restructuring Company
 'kai deshon ne apanaaya he ye idiasarkaar kii policy mekking main ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaale adhikari ne kaha, 'is idia par vitt mantralay kaa saath bhi jaruri he
 The official further said that even before that many countries have adopted the idea of bad bank and no one has failed in it
 kya hota he bed bank?'bed bank' ek aarthik avadharana he jiske antargat aarthik sankat ke samay ghate main chal rahe bainkon dwaara apni deytaon ko ek nae bank ko sthanantarit kar diya jaataa he
 This bad bank will buy their amount stuck in debt and it will be the work of this bank to deal with it
 jab kisi bank kii gaiyr nishpadit sampatti seemaa se adhik ho jaati he tab rajya ke aashwaasan par ek aise bank kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he jo mukhya bank kii deytaon ko ek nishchit samay ke liye dhaaran kar letaa he
 Rajan had opposed this, Rajarajan had opposed this saying that doing so would make the banks negligent while the banks themselves should be responsible for recovering their money
 bed bank aane kii sthiti main wo yahi samajhenge ki unhen deytaon se chhutkaaraa mil jayega
 He believed that if the loan is not repaid properly, it can cause problems if it is transferred to the bad bank
 unka ye bhi maananaa tha ki bharat ke liye bed bank or good bank kaa concept sahi nahin he

 For Kapil Sharma, who has been surrounded by controversies and alone on his own show for some time, there is news of happiness
 kapil sharma ke bichade hue saathi or jigari dost chandan prabhakar aakhirkaar kapil sharma ke sho par vaapis aa gaye hai
 Chandan has started shooting for Kapil Sharma's show
 australia se lautate vakt hue jhagade ke baad se hi kapil sharma ke sabhi saathiyon ne unka saath chhod diya
 Sunil Grover, Ali Asgar, Sugandha Mishra and Chandan Prabhakar have not appeared on the show since the feud in March, but Chandan is finally returning to the show
 chandan ne soni channel ke ofishal fasebuk acount se live chat kar logon ko is baat kii jaankaree di
 Chandan also spoke on the quarrel with Kapil during this time
 chandan prabhakar ne sho se alag hone kii baat par kaha ki unhen kuch samay ke liye brake kii zarurat thi
 He said, 'when there is water on the clothes, it takes some time to dry
 ' chandan ne kapil sharma sho se dobaaraa judane kii vajah kaa bhi zikr kiya
 He said, 'every action reacts in the same and opposite direction
 ham sabhi parivaar kii tarah hai
 i have spent half my life working with Kapil
 agar main is baat ko ek bada mudda banaakar pesh karata or kahata ki mujhe jindagi main kapil ke saath kaam nahin karnaa he to yah thik nahin hota
 If i reacted against Kapil at that time, it is correct
 lekin main is baat ko jivan bhar nahin khinch saktaa
 Two brothers in a family quarrel but this does not mean that they leave each other forever
 ' tippaniyan Let me tell you that Chandan Prabhakar has been with Kapil since his college days and is a very good friend
 chandan ne yah bhi bataaya ki unke sho chhodane ke baad kapil sharma ne unase kai baar sampark kiya
 He said, 'kapil called me on the show several times
 vah apni patni ke saath mere ghar par bhi aae
 He saw my little daughter and also met my family members
 aise main mujhe is baat kaa ehsaas hua ki mujhe jivan bhar is vivaad ko lekar nahin dhona chahie

 This is the best frame of my life

 But i cannot draw this thing for a lifetime

 rielity sho big bos ke ghar main ab tak kaa sabase real drama
 Police arrested Armaan Kohli, acting on a complaint by British singer and Bigg Boss 7 expelled contestant Sophia Hayat
 armaan ko mangalvaar ko court main pesh kiya jayega
 Sophia Hayat accused Armaan of assault and mistreatment
 armaan kohli ke khilaaf police ne dhara-509 (shabdon yaa harkaton se kisi ko prahaar karnaa), dhara- 504 (jaanboojhkar kisi ko uksaana) or dhara- 324 (nuksaan pahunchane ke makasad se kisi cheez kaa istemaal kar hamalaa karnaa) ke tahat mukadmaa darj kiya he
 Under these sections Armaan can be given one to two years of imprisonment or fine or both punishments simultaneously
 aaj tak ne jab armaan ke pita or nirmaataa-nirdeshak rajkumaar kohli se sampark kiya to unhone kaha, 'main bahut dukhi hum
 i have not been able to sleep for many days
 main uskaa pita hum
 Nobody can understand what is passing on me
 'sophia jis tevar main big bos ke ghar se nikali thim, tabhi se tufaan ke asaar najar aane lage the
 Armaan Kohli, who was a bully in Bigg Boss house, was careless
 unhen to khabar bhi nahin he ki maamla police ke paas pahunch chukaa he
 Armaan Kohli was unaware of the complaint lodged with the police of Sophia who had been homeless
 unhone sochaa hoga ki har sijan main aisa hota he
 People get angry, slap their feet, complain, but get out of the last match that is out of Bigg Boss house
 mukaable se baahar hone vaala pratiyogi agar ninsaphi kii baat kare, to sunata bhi koun he
 But this time Sophia brought the game of Bigg Boss out of that boundary
 sophia ne mumbai ke santakruj police thane main yah shikaayat kii thi
 The police had filed a zero FIR
 chunki big bos kaa studio lonawala ilaake main he isliye police ne is cese ko lonawala police stesan main transfar kar diya
 On 16 December Lonavala police knocked on the door of Bigg Boss house
 sutron ke mutabik big bos ne armaan ko canfeshan room main bulaayaa or unhen vahiin se hi baahar bhej diya gaya
 But Big Boss is also a player player
 ghar ke duusare logon ko kuch pataa nahin he ki baahar sophia or armaan kii ladaai kis mode par pahunch chuki he
 No one knows that the curtain show at the moment has faded in front of the real show going on outside
 big bos ne iske baad tanisha ko canfeshan room main bulaayaa
 Tanisha was instructed in the traditional style of the show to pack and send Armaan's bag
 armaan ke agsit ko lekar tanisha ko big bos ne bataaya he ki unhen kisi behad jaruri kaam se janaa padaa he
 For the first time in the game of Big Boss, such a twist has come so that any contestant who is out of the house can influence it
 pehali baar koi khilaadi is tarah mukaable se baahar hua he
 Now the two characters of Bigg Boss, have created a different equation in the outside world
 sophia ke mutabik 4 disambar ko unke saath armaan kohli ne badasluki kii
 Only a part of the day was shown on the show and the rest was not aired
 lonavala police ne channel se big bos ke ghar kii us apisod kii sari footage bhi maangi thi, jisase sab spasht ho sake
 There is no response from the channel yet, but the producers are supporting the police
 rielity sho kaa itnaa real drama darshakon ko pehali baar dekhne mil rahaa he
 Police will take action against Armaan under the law, but it will be interesting for people to see what stories will be made in the Bigg Boss house regarding Armaan's exit
 kisi ajeeb baat he ki big bos ke ghar main is tarah dahaadane vaale armaan kohli ab khud police kii giraft main hai
 And this arrest is not the task of Bigg Boss
 is puure maamle par pratikriya dete hue big bos ke purv pratiyogi rahul mahajan ne kaha ki vivaad to har rielity sho main hota he, lekin agar hinsa ho rahi he to big bos ko hinsa karne vaale pratiyogi ko turant ghar se nikaal dena chahie

 About three months ago, Reliance Jio knocked in the country with the best plans of aggressive and telecom history
 iske saath mobile yugers main jaise koharaam much gaya or din raat reliance store par lambii qatari dekhne ko mili
 Who doesn't want to get unlimited free calling and free 4G internet across the country
 kamobesh abhi bhi iske customers ke badhane kaa silsilaa jari he
 But now the issue has got complicated because telecom giants Airtel, Vodafone, Idea and BSNL have prepared to compete with plan by plan
 vakt badla or sabhi companiyon ke tarriff bhieirtel, vodaphone or edia ne lagbhag jeeyo jaise plan launch bhi kar die hai, lekin beasenal 1 janvari se aise plan launch kar saktaa he
 In such a situation, the biggest difficulty for Jio is that at present, the condition of its network across the country is not as good as that of other telecom companies
 internet kii baat karen to kai jagahon par jeeyo puri tarah fail dikhataa he, bhale hi mukesh ambani ne kaha ki aisi problem sirf kuch logon ko hi he
 But if we go through the social media, then the claims of his claims are exposed
 baharhaal ham aapako bataate hai ki kaise airtel, edia,vodaphone or beasenal ke plan, sarvice or connactivity ke aage chal kar reliance jeeyo ke customers main send laga sakate hai
 Currently, Jio is free, but its tariffs will start after March and then its plan starts at Rs 149
 haalanki preeped plan kii shuruyaat 19 or 129 rupee se he, lekin inaki validity sirf 7 din he
 Therefore, we will compare the plan with validity for one month
 reports ke mutabik teen maheene ke baad duusari telecom companiyaan or bhi aakraamak plan laa kar jeeyo ko maat dene kii taiyaari main hai
 Comparison of Airtel, Vodafone and Idea plans with Reliance Jio We have compared the recently launched Airtel, Vodafone and Idea plans with Jio tariff for you
 iske baad aap khud hi andaja laga sakenge
 Reliance Jio Rs 149 Prepaid Plan - In this, users get 28 days validity
 iske alaava local, astidi or roming sabhi network par puri tarah se free he
 It will get 300MB of data and unlimited data will be available from 2 pm to 5 pm
 100 local or neshnal esemes milenge
 Apart from this, it has 700MB of data which will be available through Jio Hot Spot i
e
 Public wifi, which has no known address at first
 ek aakhri baat jeeyo yuj karne ke liye aapako paas 4G vaala smartphone hona laazmi he
 Airtel prepaid plan of Rs 145 - Airtel's plan validity is 28 days and under this there is Airtel free calling from Airtel across the country
 isamen 300MB 4G data milegaa, lekin agar aapke paas 4G smartphone nahin he to aapako 50MB data milegaa
 However, there is also a Rs 345 plan which also has unlimited calling and 1GB 4G data on any network across the country
 vodaphone kaa 144 rupee vaala preeped plan -iske tahat 28 dinon tak vodaphone tu vodaphone analimited wais colling ke saath 300MB 4G data milegaa
 Apart from this, national roaming is also free
 iske saath hi ek or plan he 344 rupee kaa jisamen maheene bhar kisi bhi network par local astidi kol analimited free or 1GB 4G data
 You do not have to have a 4G smartphone even for this plan
 aakhri baat, company ne dabl back ofer laae hai yani 1jibi data kii jagah ab 2jibi data mil rahaa he
 Idea prepaid plan of Rs 148 - Idea has free calling and 300MB data free from Idea
 iske liye bhi 4ji handset kii jarurat nahin or 50MB extra data bhi he
 The second plan is 348, under which calling is free across the country on all networks throughout the month and there is also 1 GB of data
 beasenal kaa aane vaala plan -agenda ajtak main beasenal ke siio ne kaha ki aane vaale dinon sambhawatah 1 janvari se jeeyo ke har plan ko ek ek karke takkar diya jayega
 He has also said that the best and most network across the country belongs to BSNL
 ab aapane in chaaron companiyon ke basic plan ke bare menjankaree hasil kar lee he to ek or batadhyaan main rakhen
 Since Airtel, BSNL, Vodafone and Idea are old telecom companies, their networks across the country are tremendous and have more connectivity than Jio
 reliance jeeyo abhi bhi kai jagahon par jiro he
 Second thing is that if people already have their sims and even the best 3G smartphones and now more and more packs like Jio have come, then why would anyone bother to take Jio? The answer to this question will be well received when Jio tariffs will start in March, because who does not like the goods for free

 Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa on Sunday canceled his visit to Delhi amid signs of him being asked to resign, claiming that he had the support of 120 mlas and that his options could be the only ones

 kulbhushan jadhav ko lekar die gaye apane bayaan par bavaal ke baad samaajawaadee party netaa naresh agarwal baikfoot par dikhaai de rahe hai
 Earlier he had given a statement justifying Pakistan's attitude with Jadhav, but when he was criticized by BJP and other party leaders including his own party, his tone changed
 is bayaan par hua bavalanus agency ko die apane bayaan main rajyasabha saansad naresh agarwal ne kaha tha, 'agar unhone (pakistan) kulbhushan jadhav ko antkavaadi mana he, to wo us hisaab se hi vyavhaar karenge
 Terrorists should be treated in the same way in our country
 pakistan kii jelon main saikadon bhartiya band hai, aise main unki bhi baat honi chahie, sirf jadhav kii nahin
 The BJP immediately surrounded this statement of Naresh Aggarwal
 bijepi saansad giriraaj singh ne unke bayaan ko sharmasaar karne vaala bataaya to subrahmanyam swami ne maafee na maangane par sansad sadsyta kii jane kii maang kar daali
 Even his own party condemned the statement
 naresh agarwal ke badale suraiske baad naresh agarwal ne apane bayaan par safai di or ek ghanta bitne se pehle hi unke sur badalte dikhaai die
 In his clarification, he said, 'there is no such thing as government in Pakistan, there is the rule of military and ISI
 hamen pakistan se maanviyata kii ummid nahin rakhni chahie
 That is why i am saying that we should adopt a tough attitude with his terrorists
 naresh agarwal ne ye bhi kaha ki unhone kisi agency ko aisa bayaan nahin diya he
 Agarwal said that he has only said that the issue of all Hindus in Pakistan jails should be raised, not just Kulbhushan Jadhav

 He is, above all, an anecdote, ie the modern-day bard or poet
 raveesh ne 19 saal pehle reporting karnaa shuru kiya tha, or shuruyaat se hi pahchaan liya tha ki television kisson kaa madhyam he, so, raveesh ne un khabaron ko chunaa jo shartiya waisi hi thim
 The stories, whose characters looked like themselves, had a beginning, a middle, and an end
 yahi khoji or sachai ke pakshdhar ke rup main raveesh kii kamyaabi kaa raaj he, or yahi vajah he magsese puraskaar ke rup main unki badi kamyaabi kii
 Television time moves in the same direction
 ab, yah saamaanya gyaan he ki samay to isi tarah chalata he, lekin jab ham kuch padhate hai, ham kuch shabdon yaa anuchhedon ko chhod sakate hai, taaki dobaaraa aakar, baad main unhen phir pard or samaj saken
 It is like bringing back the past, but LIVE news only happens in real time, it cannot be returned
 or agar aapane dekhne vaale ko bich main kahin kho diya, to vah hameshaa ke liye kho jaataa he
 Ravish recognized this truth, and adopted a unique approach like kisasagoi, as tales are tied together with tales
 unhen yaad karnaa aasaan hota he, khaastaur se hamaare jaise mulk main, jahaan bahut badi taadaad lagbhag nirakshar logon kii he
 Ravish's language and gesture seem to embody all the tricks that have been adopted from established novelists to filmmakers and folk artists
 vah apni bhashaa ko bina kisi dikkat ke sambhraant logon kii bhashaa se turant gali main ghoomane vaale pheriwale kii bhashaa bana liya karte hai
 But just being a clever storyteller could not get Ravish to where he is today
 patrakarita kii apni chhavi yah he ki vah loktantr kaa chauthaa stambh kahi jaati he
 It gets information about the government, state institutions, economy, politicians and well-known personalities, and reaches out to the people
 news media soochna ke zariye nagarikon ko shashakt banaati he, taaki ve satta main baithe logon dwaara kiye ja rahe sambhavit atikaraman ko roak saken
 Journalists believe that the way of telling the truth should be fair and balanced, and the traditional way of doing this is to give equal opportunity to the voice of both sides in the news
 raveesh kumaar ne jaanboojhkar is paramparaagat tareeke ko chhod diya
 He wanted to bring out the anecdote of those who have no name - laborers, homeless widows, children waiting for mid-day meals in a village school, butchers, bakeries or candle makers
 or raveesh chaahate the ki in logon kaa bhi koi naam ho, pahchaan ho, kyonki unka rozaana kiya jane vaala sangharsh bhi loktantr ke liye utana hi ahm he, jitna sansad main pesh kiye ja rahe nae vidheyak hote hai
 Ravish showed these invisible people in our daily lives
 raveesh jaanate hai ki in logon ke kisson ko 'santulit' tareeke se nahin dikhaaya ja saktaa, kyonki satta main baithe logon kii tulana main in logon kaa koi vazan hi nahin he
 The truth of the powerless can be revealed only when they are given a unilateral voice
 television kii duniya main maujuud shesh patrakaron se raveesh kumaar ko alag karne vaala teesraa ahm pahalu yah he ki vah shiksha shodh ke kshetra main lagaataar ho rahi gatividhiyon or vikaas par kareebi nazar rakhte hai
 He reads difficult and complex research works everyday, not just to increase his knowledge, but also to explain them to the common man in the language of the common man
 yah ek behad kaam he, jo bhartiya television par lagbhag koi bhi anya patrkaar nahin karata he
 Educationists work on new ideas, and find new ways to see the world
 nai shodh aksar aamtaur par pratelit manyataon ko nakaara jaataa he, lekin shiksha kii band duniya ne apni takneekee bhashaa viksit kar lee he, jise samajhnaa gaiyr-prashikshiton ke bas kii baat nahin he
 Ravish Kumar does a very important job of bringing these new researches to the public
 apane kariyar ke kaaphi bade hisse te dauraan raveesh bhartiya tivi ke samachar darshakon ke liye nayak rahe hai
 It becomes difficult for him to go anywhere, as crowds of fans surround him, people try to shake hands with him, or take selfies with him
 lekin lambe arase tak unke saathi patrakaron ne unhen gambhirtha se nahin liya
 He considered Ravish as an 'offbeat' journalist who does not understand 'hard news'
 raveesh in saathiyon ko 'lutiyans patrkaar' kehete rahe - ve patrkaar, jisaki samaj se khabaron kaa sirf ek hi uchit or vaid vishay hota he - satta ke galiyare
 Nevertheless, the incumbent people, who were never afraid of the so-called journalists, were troubled by the 'offbeat' stories of Ravish Kumar
 raveesh kumaar ne sach bolkar janata kii nabz pakad lee, or bataaya ki satta darasal kis tarah kaam kar rahi he
 These reports made Ravish Kumar a favorite of those who were unhappy with the government
 varsh 2011 se 2014 ke bich to aisa sachmuch kuch zyaada hua, jab raveesh kumaar UPA sarkaar kii ahm yojanaon kii naakaami ko ujagar kar rahe the
 The atmosphere changed when UPA collapsed
 soshal media par raveesh kumaar kii tarifon ke pul baandhne vaale log hi unhen rashtravirohi kehane lage, kyonki ab raveesh us sarkaar se sawaal kar rahe the, jinka samarthan ve log kar rahe the
 It started with abusive and trolling, but soon she turned into abusive phone calls, and then openly threatened to kill, not just Ravish, but his family
 koi bhi hota, to vah dabaav main jhuk gaya hota, apana rukh narm kar liya hota, yaa sab kuch chhod-chhadkar kinare baith gaya hota, lekin raveesh ne aisa nahin kiya
 He faced off strongly, and continued to run his show every night as a 'voice of protest'
 fark sirf itnaa tha ki ab vah akeli awaz the
 Apart from this, television news had become a part of any department of the government
 is kathin samay main bhi raveesh kumaar ne sangharshon or vidroh ke kisse sunaanaa jari rakhaa he
 They are the weak weapon today
 dilli main nae saal ke jashn ke dauraan huddang machaane waalon kii khayr nahin
 To curb such hoodlings, the Delhi Police has set up its gear
 dilli police ne man bana liya he ki 31 disambar kii raat dilli kii sadakon par hangaamaa, hulladabaji or sharaab pikar driving karne waalon ke saath dilli police sakhti se nipategi
 Delhiites go to hotels and restaurants to party on the night of 31 December, and many arrive at Dil Connaught Place in Delhi with the intention of having fun
 lekin is baar dilli police ne conot place or nai dilli ke ilaakon main hone vaali hulladabaji ko rokane ke liye kade bandobast kiye hai
 Police planning - Every vehicle going to Connaught Place will be checked
 - aise log jo apane parivaar or mahilaon ke saath honge or jinke paas hotel, pub or restaraan ke invitesan honge, unhen hi conot place main entry di jaaegi
 Special campaign will be conducted by the Delhi Traffic Police on the night of 31 December against those who drive drunk
 - ladakon ke group ko sadakon par or kaaron main savaar hokar nai dilli or conot place ke ilaake main entry or shor-sharaaba karne kii ijaajat nahin hogi
 - Hotels, discos, bars and pubs which do not have 24 * 7 working license have been asked to stop the party at one o'clock at night
 dilli police kaa kahana he ki naye saal ke maukey par log enjvoy karen, is par unhen koi aitraaj nahin he, par kisi bhi dilliwaale ko niyamon kaa ullandhan karne or huddang machaane kii ijaajat nahin di jaaegi
 Delhi Police has tried to give this message by showing strict rules and strictness that Delhiites should celebrate the New Year celebrations with pomp, but also keep in mind the rules and regulations, so that there is no disturbance in their New Year celebrations

 20PM is the government for 10 years, there will be some anti-incumbency: Rahul Gandhi has been in government for 10 years, this is true, you cannot change it and it is a big achievement in itself
 nehru ji kii sarkaar sabase lambii sarkaar thi or unke baad manmohan singh ji kii sarkaar sabase lambii sarkaar he
 If there is such a long government, then there will be some anti-incumbency, this thing has to be accepted

 07PM congress ko bahumat milanaa chahie: rahul gandhirahul gandhi ne kaha, congress ko bahumat milanaa chahie
 But our fight is actually a battle of ideology, there are two ideologies in the election

 We talk of decentralization, we talk of rights
 unki soch satta kii shakti he, ek vyakti sari shakti le jaae or hindustan ko is tarah se chalaae
 This is a completely different kind of ideology
 agar aap congress party kii safaltaaon ko dekhenge to aap dekhenge ki ham tab safal hote hai jab logon ko shakti dete hai
 We are doing this only through the freedom struggle
 aazaadee kii ladaai main logon shakti di, haritakranti ke samay shakti di, telecom kranti ke samay shakti di or logon kaa soochna kaa adhikaar, bhojan kaa adhikaar aadi adhikaar dekar bhi shakti di he

 After the death of Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Rajasekhara Reddy in a chopper accident, now questions are being raised that after all, the Chief Minister had to pay the cost of whose mistake by giving up his life
 aaj tak uthaa rahaa he wo das sawaal jo pehali najar main suraksha main chook auki laaparvaahee kii kahani kah rahe hai
 How did the emergency locator transmitter fail? a claim from Andhra Pradesh Aviation raised hopes of Reddy's well-being nearly 13 hours after Chief Minister Rajasekhara Reddy's helicopter crashed
 api aviation ne daawa kiya ki mukhyamantri ke helicopter ke durghatnagrast hone kii ashanka kam he kyonki agar aisa hota to helicopter main laga immergency loketor transmeter ek khaas frequency par signal jarur bhejtaa lekin avi aviation kaa ye daawa chhalaava niklaa
 The helicopter was a victim of the accident but no such signal was ever found
 sawaal ye ki helicopter kaa immergency loketor transmeter aakhir kyon kaam nahin kar rahaa tha
 Had the ELT been working, the news of the accident would have been received immediately
 personal recovery bekan kahaan tha?aam taur par har hawaii safar main payalat ke paas ek personal recovery bekan hota he
 Which becomes active in the event of an accident and gives information about its location via GPS
 lekin reddy ke helicopter ke haadase ke baad personal recovery bekan ne bhi koi signal nahin bheja
 So, did the pilot of this helicopter not have personal recovery beckons? Why not check before take off? Usually, every flight is thoroughly checked before the flight to see if there are any technical defects
 lekin khabar aa rahi he ki mukhyamantri rajasekhar reddy kii udaan se pehle helicopter kii jaanch nahin kii gai
 After all, why so much negligence with VIP security? Why not regular pilots with CM? Pilots flying from Old Begumpet Airport in Hyderabad to Chief Minister Rajasekhara Reddy were not regular pilots of the Chief Minister
 kharaab mausam main iregular payalat ke saath udaan bharna kahin mukhyamantri kii jindagi par to baari nahin pad gaya
 Bell has also cheated before! Questions are also being raised on the capability of the helicopter after the accident
 bel helicopter pehle bhi kai baar dhokhaa de chukaa he
 The speaker was aboard GMC Balayogi Bell-206 when the accident happened and he died
 bel-430 jis par mukhyamantri rajasekhar reddy udaan bhar rahe the usamen bhi kai baar takneekee kharabi kii samasya ai he
 In such a situation, questions are arising whether the bell helicopters meet all the safety standards
 der se kyon shuru hua search oparation?subah ke 9 bajkar 35 minute ke aasapaas aakhri baar mukhyamantri ke helicopter kaa sampark air trephic controlar se hua
 The administration should have been attentive soon after the chopper lost contact with the Controller but surprisingly the search for the Chief Minister's missing helicopter started around 4 am
 aakhir itani let-latifi kyon?payalton ko nahin tha raste kaa andaja?mukhyamantri helicopter raste se bhatak gaya tha or nallamala ke jangalon main ek pahaad kii chotii se ja takaraayaa
 The question was whether the pilots did not know the air route accurately? Or there was a big problem in the helicopter itself? Why was the demand for new chopper deferred? The demand for a new chopper was made for the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh a year ago but the new chopper is not ready yet
 jaahir he nae helicopter kii jarurat ko puraa karne main zyada vakt lagaaya gaya
 And the same late-death was overshadowed by the Chief Minister's life
 talaashi main naakaam kyon?mukhyamantri ke helicopter ke laapata hone ke kareeb 24 ghante baad jaakar mila unka suraag
 Whereas from Air Force helicopters to very modern aircraft such as Donier and Sukhoi were engaged in search operation
 isro ke satellite bhi koi suraag nahin juta paae
 In such a situation, this incident has made a big stand on our security preparations
 kharaab mausam main kyo bhari udaan?pichley kai dinon se andhrapradesh ke is ilaake main jabardast barish ho rahi thi or mausam behad kharaab tha
 However, the helicopter was allowed to fly
 bel helicopter main badal bhare aasmaan main bhi udne kii kshamta hoti he
 In such a situation, the question remains that how did the helicopter fall victim to its accident
 dilli ke upmukhyamantri manish sitaudiya ne aabkaari vibhaag ke adhikariyon ke saath somvaar kii shaam ko mayur vihaar phej-2 ilaake kii sharaab kii chaar dukaanon par chhapemari kii or ek dukaan kaa license nilambit kar diya

 logon ko shaayad uski baat bhi pasand aati thi
 After months and years, he had cultivated himself as a person who could live happily
 
 The idea of being happy was being distributed among the people
 logon se inbox par baat karne ke dauraan mili kuch tarifon ne uske akelepan ko khatm kar diya tha
 Between the fatigue of the job and the loneliness of life, he started feeling happy that he is sharing the pain of the people
 khushiyaan failaa rahaa he
 Then one day when his mischief took off, Achman found himself in a misunderstanding
 man uchatate hi na jane use kya suujhi or ek kaali raat 9
 At 10 pm, he killed his Facebook account Deactivate
 wo shaayad khud ke akelepan se baat karnaa chaah rahaa tha
 But one day it was probably that he came to know that Yashika, a Facebook friend, had committed suicide
 ye sunate hi use wo sab baaten yaad aane lageen jo coment
 
 inbox main wo aksar yashika se kar liya karata tha
 Amidst patience and growing restlessness, he activates the account as soon as he returns
 ek massej use miltaa he, massej yashika kaa
 9 the same night
 10 par bheja ek massej
 Achman
 
 
 tum kehete ho jindagi hanskar jini chahie
 But this is difficult
 mujhe tumse kuch jaruri baat kerani he
 
 kya abhi baat ho sakati he
 This was Yashika's message sent to Achman before the suicide night
 kareeb usee vakt par jab aachman ne apana acount diective kiya tha
 After reading the message many times, Achman became a fetish stone without taking any eye for a tuck
 wo massej ko pard to rahaa tha, par samajhane se shaayad batch rahaa tha
 Between reading and understanding the message, a tear from his eye jumped down, touching the last corner of the cheek
 jiske baad aansu to nahin dikhaa, bas ek geela matamaila sa nishaan gaal par rah gaya
 That message was associated with Achman's loneliness
 wo dinabhar use padhata
 
 sochataa rahata
 How many nights did he start to wake up online by waiting on Facebook that someone might be trying to tell his heart to him
 ye sach ko nazarandaaj kar ki wo ab fasebuk or logon se milane par khush rahane kii baat karnaa band kar chukaa tha
 The laughter inside him that he had covered to cover the loneliness
 
 
 maano sardi kii os main bhig chuki ho, jise odhane kaa koi matlab nahin rah jaataa he
 He was slowly starting to consider himself guilty
 shaayad us din main yashika se baat kar paata to wo aaj jinda hoti
 Don't know what kind of habit i had in myself after Yashika's departure
 anjaan
 
 digital logon se kyon itnaa judaa mahasoos karne laga tha wo khud ko
 The hill was turned into Achman, which falls anytime
 kitni hi baar raat main logon ko online dekhtaa to massej karne laga tha
 You are fine haa main thik hum
 Why are you asking this night? doston ko phone karke haal chaal poochne kii nai formality bhari aadat ho chali thi use
 But he always got everything right
 bas yashika use waapas nahin milti thi
 Neither on Facebook nor in reality
 aachman yashika se sirf 4 baar mila tha
 Hi hello and some things
 use yashika se pyaar nahin tha
 He used to appreciate her because of her emotional and good heart
 lekin ab wo apni najar main kaatil ban chukaa tha
 False things, fabricating images and a killer murderer
 maheene biit jane ke baad us kaali andheri raat main wo lagaataar yashika kaa massej padhata rahaa
 
 
 Waited for someone to go online and talk to themselves
 massej padhata rahaa
 whole night
 subah daftar na pahunchane par jab kisi ne use phone kiya, to phone kisi duusare ne uthaaya, jiske baad peeche se sirf rone
 
 
 There was the sound of screaming sobs and weeds
 aachman kaa akelaapan khatm ho chukaa tha

 Khan, who was the captain of the team that won the only Cricket World Cup in 1992 to Pakistan, has more image of a play boy than a cricketer
 aaj vahi khan parliament house ke saamne jamaa samarthakon se apil karte hai, ‘‘aapako in jaalimon se chhutkaaraa paanaa chahie, nahin to ve aapako gulaamon kii tarah jaleel karte rahenge
 "as soon as they stop, the young boys and girls gathered there repeat in jest," Go Nawaz Go "and start dancing to patriotic Sufi songs
 iske thodi der baad hi, kuch hi duuri par tejatarraar maulavee tahirul kadri bullate or bam pruf vaahan main ek duusari bheed ko sambodhit kar rahe hai, ‘‘jab tak ye bhrasht hukmran istipha nahin de dete, ham ghar nahin jaaenge
 Needless to say that most of the crowd are followers of the Sufi branch of Islam
 navaj sharif par dabaav banane ke liye unke donon virodhiyon ne haath mila liye hai or donon hi guton ke pradarshnakariyon ko ek hi manch se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 The two opposing factions have become one after the Parliament's stand to stand firmly in favor of Nawaz Sharif and not to allow Sharif to ignore the slogans of Qadri and Khan
 pichley saal hue chunaav main sharif kii pakistan muslim lig or asif ali jaradaari kii pakistan piples party ke baad tisare number par imran khan kii party taharik-e insaaf hi rahi thi
 Since then, Khan has been accused of manipulating the election, but the Sharif government has not ordered any inquiry into the allegations
 aise main unhone sharif ke khilaaf abhiyaan tej kar diya
 On the other hand, Qadri is demanding a drastic change in the election rules
 unka kahana he ki pakistan kii raajnneeti par sharif ke parivaar samet kuch hi pariwaron kaa kabja he or chunaav niyamon main sudhaar kar hi is vyavastha ko sudhara ja saktaa he
 He also wants the Chief Minister of Punjab province, Shahbaz (who is Nawaz Sharif's brother) to be removed as Pakistan's most populous and the center of politics
 Killed in police encounter in Lahore
 is muthbhed ne kadri ko sarkaar ke khilaaf pradarshan karne kaa bahaanaa de diya
 These demonstrations have put the Sharif government under pressure and ever since the protests began, Sharif and his ministers have been running from disgrace here and there to save their 14-month-old government
 beshak pakistan main rajnatik sthirataa durlabh shai he
 For most of the country's 67-year history, the army has been in power
 yahaan tak ki jab general satta main nahin rahe tab bhi asainik sarkaron ke mahatv ko kam karne or mahatvapurn suraksha tathaa videsh niti sambandhi muddon par apana niyantran banaae rakhane ke liye hastkshep jarur karte rahete the
 This time too the army is being suspected
 kai pakistaniyon kaa to maananaa he ki sharif asainik satta ko majboot karne kaa prayaas karte rahe hai
 In order to stop these efforts, the army has made the protesters its pawn
 aise shaq ko tab or bal mila jab taharik-e insaaf ke isse alag ho chuke adhyaksh javed hashmi ne bataaya ki khan kah rahe the ki sena or isaki behad taqatvar khufia agency iesai ke kuch adhikariyon ne sharif ke khilaaf unke pradarshan ko samarthan diya he
 On August 31, Hashmi said, "I don't know who planned this demonstration
" ise banane vaale hi yah jaanate honge, lekin sena or iesai kaa naam jarur vivaadon main ghasita ja rahaa he
 The army has denied this claim
 sarkaar ne shuru main sankat ko taalane ke liye sena se bich-bachaav kaa anurodh kiya tha lekin jab vipaksh ne sarkaar kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki aisa karne se generalon kii raajnneeti main dakhal kii pushti hogi to sena peeche hat gai
 Lawyer Zahid Khan of Awami National Party said, "we value the army, but we don't like their interference in politics
" yah unka kaam nahin he
 Despite the army's denials, criticism continues over its role
 ritred general talat masood kehete hai, ‘‘sena kii madad ke bina to yah sambhav ho hi nahin saktaa tha
 "apart from this, the hesitation of the army to prevent the protesters from moving towards Parliament and Nawaz Sharif's house also puts his intention of dealing with the crisis in doubt
" tab hui jhadpon main teen logon kii maut ho gai or kai jakhmi ho gaye the
 On 1 September, protesters entered the government TV PTV office and stopped broadcasting for nearly an hour
 un logon ne imaaraton ko khaali kara diya or andar ghuste samay ‘‘pakistan sena jindabad’’ ke naare lagane lage
 The incident was a recurrence of a similar incident on October 12, 1999
 us din sena ne sharif kaa takhta palat diya tha or general parvej murshraf ne pakistan kii satta sanbhali thi
 The special thing is that instead of condemning the provocative actions of the protesters throughout the episode, the army also warned the government not to use force against them, which received much criticism in the media
 rashtriya akhbaar don ne 2 sitambar ko kadaa sampadakeey likhaa, ‘‘lagata he, sena sanvaidhanik vyavastha se anbhigya he yaa jaanane kaa prayaas nahin karnaa chaahati
 The government orders the army, not the army
 kya sena general headquarter ke saamne kuch ghante ke liye hi shantipurna pradarshan kii ijaajat degi?’’prekshkon kaa kahana he ki sharif ke apni satta sthapit karne ke prayaason se general naaraaz ho gaye
 The army prepared the role of this crisis only to curb the increasing elected power of Sharif
 isse pehle bhi satta main rahete hue senadhyakshon se takaraav le chuke sharif ne is november main general raahil sharif (unke sambandhi nahin hai ye) ko sena pramukh banaakar phir sena kii naaraazgi mol le lee
 But a few days later differences arose between the two
 1999 main sharif kaa takhta palat kar satta hathiyaane vaale parvej musharraf par rajdroh ke maamle main mukadmaa chalaane kaa iraadaa sena pramukh ko raas nahin aayaa
 They wanted Musharraf, who had been convicted by a lower court, to be acquitted
 videsh niti sambandhi kai bade maamle sharif ke khud haath main lene kii koshishon se bhi sena khafa thi, aakhir parampara se aise maamle sena ke hi ekadhikaar main rahe hai
 One of these was to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi
 sena iske khilaaf thi
 Also delay in approving military action against Taliban
 iesai pramukh leftinent general jahirul islam ke jeeyo media samooh ke saath takaraav main sharif ne jeeyo kaa paksh liya
 The army was also angry with this
 april main is media samooh ne aarope lagaaya tha ki jahir group ke pramukh anker hamid mir kii hatya karwaanaa chaahate hai
 Experts say that the crisis will be averted due to the support of the Sharif of the Parliament and the lack of support for the protesters, but it will definitely reduce the credibility of the government
 khabar yah bhi he ki sarkaar dwaara sankat khatm karne main sena se madad kii guhaar ke baad sena ne kaha he ki suraksha sambandhi mahatvapurn maamalon main sarkaar apni dakhsandaji band kare
 Sharif's position is also weak due to the poor performance of his government
 aarthik mandi dur karne or bijli ke satat sankat ko dur karne ke vaade par unhone chunaav jeeta tha
 6, his government from the International Monetary Fund to overcome the balance of payments crisis
 6 arab dollar kaa rin bhi mila tha, lekin ve apekshit sudhaar nahin kar paae hai
 These include significant reforms such as widening the tax net to include large landowners
 iske alaava bijli kii baari kami ko bhi sarkaar nahin thik kar pai he
 In many areas, there is still 8-10 hours of power failure, which is causing huge damage to the economy
 unke virdohi un par bhai-bhatijawad kaa bhi aarope lagaate hai
 His family and at least 18 members of the clan hold important government positions in Punjab and Central Government
 parivaarwaad ke ye aarope andolankariyon ko bhaavnaatmak takat de rahe hai
 However, the Pakistan government has denied reports that the military is pressurizing or interfering with security-related policies
 sharif ke kareebi or sarkaar main mantri shahid khaakaan abbasi kaa kahana he, ‘‘aisi kisi vyavastha par charchaa nahin kii gai he
 "analysts are of the opinion that even if Sharif escapes this crisis, he may continue to face such crisis
 masood kehete hai, ‘‘satta kii drushti se dekhen to ve kaaphi kamjor ho gaye hai
 If saved from this crisis, they can get back the lost land but it will have to be seen whether they will be able to complete their tenure

 Have you ever thought that you will be able to buy internet at a tea shop
 wo bhimhaj 2 rupee main
 You might not have even thought about this until a few days ago, but the wireless network startup wifi Dabba of Bangalore has created a stir by launching it
 sasta internet dene vaali jeeyo ko yah starop kadi takkar de rahaa he
 Because of these, you can buy internet on the hand of several tea vendors in Bangalore and at the grocery for just 2 rupees
 jeeyo ko de rahaa takkarjis vakt memriliance geyonne free internet dena shuru kiya he, us vakt main wifai dabba ne shuruaati dinon main hi apni pahchaan bana lee he
 Currently, this startup is providing internet for Rs 2 in many cities of Bangalore
 lekin aaj logon ko do rupee main internet dene vaale is starop kii shuruyaat kaaphi asafalataaon ke baad hui he
 His idea was the introduction of the ideawife Dabba, Shubhendu Sharma and Karam Laxman
 Aajtak
 In a special conversation with in, Shubhendu said that the wifi box is a success after 6 years of failure and shutting down of more than 33 apps
 pichley 6 saalon ke dauraan hamane siikhaa ki hamen un logon ke liye kuch karne kii jarurat he, jo aaj bhi internet se achoote hai
 Shubhendu said that wifi Dabba is his third startup with Karam
 aage padhie is baatcheet ke kuch ansh :wifai dabba shuru karne kaa idia kaise aayaa?hamane pichley 6 saal ke dauraansoshal mediase lekar taxi driveron ke liye kai ap taiyaar kiye
 Meanwhile in 2016, we launched an app 'stepney'
 is ap ko hamane taxi driveron ko dhyaan main rakhkar banaaya tha
 Through this app, we tried to create a platform for taxi drivers, where they could easily share their views
 nahin mili safaltaalekin ham isamen safal nahin rahe
 During this time we came to know that Kitaxy drivers are not showing interest in our app for two reasons
 ek to shahar main kharaab internet connactivity or duusari ki unke liye hamaara ap khareednaa kaaphi mahangaa sabit ho rahaa tha
 Then we thought why not start an affordable internet service for the common people and thus came into existence 'wifi Dabba'
 'shuruyaat kaise hui?wifai dabbashuru karne kaa vichaar aane ke 4 se 5 hafton ke bheetar hamane iskaa prototip taiyaar kar liya tha
 We put it on many tea stalls as a trial
 prototip lagane ke kuch ghanton ke bheetar hi darjanon logon ne ise yuj karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 When we saw that more and more people were using it, we understood that it needed to be taken up on a large scale and thus we started expanding its scope
 jeeyo kii entry kaa kya asar rahaa?saal 2016 ke bich main hi reliance jeeyo ne sasta internet laakar dhamaakaa kar diya tha
 Jio's plans were quite cheap at that time
 is dauraan hamane jeeyo kaa asar jaanane ke liye ek survey kiya
 We asked in this why people are using internet of wifi case even after the arrival of Jio
 survey main saamne aayaa ki jeeyo kaa sasta internet bhi aam aadmi ke liye abhi sasta nahin he
 This gave us energy and we continued to improve our work
 kaise dete hai itnaa sasta internet?hamane apnesoftware or hardwareko is tareeke se taiyaar kiya he ki isaki vajah se graahakon ko hamase internet khareednaa mahangaa na pade
 We offer customers 100mbps lines, specially designed routers and tokens
 inhen token ko dukandaar bechate hai or logon ko inaki badaulat hi internet yuj karne ko miltaa he
 What were the challenges in the beginning? During the introduction of the wifi case we had to try to prepare hardware and software for it
 isamen hamaara sabase zyada samay hi nahin, balki kharch bhi hua
 We tried to do every job in a better way so that people can get cheaper internet
 bhavishya ke liye kya yojanaayen hai?philhal hamaari praathamikta wifai dabba ko purebengaloorushahra main pahunchaana he
 For this, we are working day and night
 ham lagaataar hardware or software ko behatar karne ke liye kaam kar rahe hai
 This will provide internet at even more affordable prices
 jab channpura ke baliram singh ko vaarisliaganj, jila navada chini mil chaalu hone kii ummid jaagi to unhone do bigha jameen main ganna laga diya
 Now sugarcane is ready, but there is no possibility of opening of sugar mill
 4 janvari 2012: tasveeron main dekhen india tudabliram kehete hai, ''mil jab chaalu thi tab aarthik tangi ganne kii upaj se dur ho jaati thi
 "now the situation is that he had to fulfill his dream of raising the sister's doli by selling one-third of the bigha land

 saah kehete hai, ''lij par di jane vaali band chini milon kaa moolyankan zyada kar diya gaya he
 Machines and buildings are no longer useful except in closed mills
 niveshkon ko bainkon kaa bhi puraa sahyog nahin mil paa rahaa
 The geographical structure of the command area of sugar mills has also changed
 ''21 disambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india todayah kissa akele baliram kaa nahin he
 There are hundreds of farming families, laborers and mill workers in Bihar who are disappointed with the closure of sugar mills
 aisi hi niraashaa rajya sarkaar main bhi he
 14 December 2011: See in pictures India Today State Government had asked for tenders from private investors to run Banmankhi, Hathua (including Distillery), Guraru, Goraul, Siwan, Samastipur and Lohat sugar mill besides Warisleiganj
 pichley saal disambar main tender bharne ke aakhri din tak teen chini milon ke liye chah aavedan hi mili hai
 07 December 2011: See India Today in pictures This is the fourth time investors have shown less interest in sugar mills
 rajya sarkaar 2006 se hi saarvajanik kshetra kii band 15 chini milon ko chaalu karne, uski kshamta vistaar karne or nai chini milon kii sthapana kaa prayaas karti rahi he
 There was a time when 40 percent of the country's sugar production came from Bihar, now it is barely 4 percent
 aazaadee se pehle 33 chini milen thim, ab 28 rah gai hai
 Of this, 10 are under private management
 jinamein bagaha or motihaari kii sthiti thik nahin he
 30 November 2011: In pictures, three of the 18 sugar mills of India Todaybaki are owned by the BIC Group, a government of India undertaking

 8 of farmers near units
 84 karod ru
 And 300 crores of employees
 bakaayaa he
 The problem is that investors are interested in making ethanol, whereas the state government does not have this right
 aise main band chini milon ko chaalu kara paanaa badi chunauti he
 Prior to December 28, 2007, there was approval to make ethanol directly from sugarcane juice
 disambar, 2007 ko ganna (niyantran) aadesh, 1996 main sanshodhan kiya gaya, jiske tahat sirf chini milen hi ithenul bana sakati hai
 Difficulties start from here
 eastern bihar industries association ke adhyaksh mukutadhaari agarwal kehete hai, ''2007 se pehle ganne ke ras se ithenul banane kii chhot thi
 But the effort for sugar mills in Bihar could not be accelerated at that time
 jab prayaas tej hua tab alag se ithenul unit kii sthapana kaa praavdhaan desh bhar main band kar diya gaya
 This has a direct impact on Bihar
 ''bihar ke ganna udyog or laghu jal sansaadhan mantri avadhesh prasad kushvaha ne bataaya, ''rajya sarkaar pehle paanch saal ke kaarykaal main niveshkon kaa bharosa jeetne kaa prayaas karti rahi
 Now that the interest of the investors has been aroused, the Center has rejected the demand for making ethanol from sugarcane juice and has influenced large investments in the state
 ''haal main echpisiel biophules limited ne sugauli or lauria chini milon ko chaalu kiya he
 Distillery / ethanol unit and 20-20 MW capacity power generation has also started here
 itani hi kshamta kii motipur chini mil indian potash nigam ko hastantarit kii gai he
 The process of sugarcane based industry in Tirhut Industries Ltd Rayam and food processing industry in Sakri is underway

 haalanki kushvaha daawa karte hai ki agle teen saal main bihar apni khapat ke aath lakh metric ton chini utpaadan ke lakshya ko puraa kar legaa
 Before 2005, two lakh tonnes were produced, but now it has been reduced to four lakh tonnes
 beshak sarkaar bade daawey kar rahi he
 But the ethanol-related condition and the government's weak freshness do not set much hope for the Chinese mills
 kyon dur bhaag rahe niveshak1
