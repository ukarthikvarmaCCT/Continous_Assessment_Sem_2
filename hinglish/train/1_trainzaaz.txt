 The BJP and AAP are trying to bring Sidhu into their ranks
 The Congress does not want to sideline Sidhu any more
 The party is hot about the return of the high command in Punjab's cabinet
 charchaa he ki jald hi navjot singh siddhu ek baar phir se punjab cabinet main joardaar vaapasi karenge or is baar unhen rank bhi ooncha diya jayega
 Sidhu can be made deputy CM
 sutron kii maane to khud congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi chaahati hai ki siddhu ko punjab coupamukhyamantribanaaya jaae or is babat vah captain amarinder singh se bhi baat kar chuki hai
 It is believed that due to the statements being made to satisfy the Punjab Congress mlas who are angry with the party and to bring Navjot Singh Sidhu into their court from the Aam Aadmi Party and BJP, the Congress high command Navjot Singh Sidhu is now And does not want to sideline
 mana yah bhi ja rahaa he ki captain sarkaar se kai vidhayak naaraaz chal rahe hai or naaraaz vidhayakon kii aguwai siddhu kar rahe hai
 For this reason, Navjot Singh Sidhu is preparing to return to the cabinet and he can also be given the post of Deputy CM
 is maamle par punjab congress ke tamaam netaa or khud pradesh adhyaksh sunil jakhad napa-tula bayaan de rahe hai
 Sunil Jakhar did not deny the news of a strong return to Navjot Singh Sidhuki cabinet as deputy CM, but putting the ball in the high command's court said that what the high command will decide will be valid for all
 vahiin duusari ore punjab ke siem captain amarinder singh ke polytical adwiser or vidhayak amarinder singh raja vading main ye kahkar ek nayaa vivaad khadaa kar diya ki jo mantri thik se apana kaam nahin kar rahe hai, jinaki parformens sahi nahin he, unhen mantrimandal se baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya janaa chahie
 On the other hand, AAP MLA marked the Captain government, Aam Aadmi Party MLA Kulatar Singh Sandhwa targeted the Captain Government and said that the Captain has failed to do the job properly
 siddhu ke saath hi unki party ke kai netaa naaraaz chal rahe hai
 He said that Navjot Singh Sidhu should not fall under the greed of the chair
 unhen dekhnaa chahie ki jin baton kii vajah se unhone mantri pad choda tha, vah un baton par kaayam rahen or punjab ke logon ke hit kii baat hi karte rahen
 BJP said the internal matter of the Congress, the opposition BJP, while dealing with this whole matter, said that this is an internal matter of Congress and they have to decide what responsibility should be given to Sidhu
 party ke pradesh pravaktaa vineet joshi ne siddhu kya bijepi yaa kisi anya party main jaaenge, is sawaal par kaha ki iskaa jawaab to siddhu hi de sakate hai
 Even after the resignation, the salary of the cabinet minister- Bhattanwajot Singh Sidhu resigned from the post of cabinet minister on 20 July
 iske baad vah punjab sachivalay yaa vidhansabha nahin gaye
 Despite this, the salary and allowances of Sidhu are being prepared according to the cabinet minister
 vidhansabhake record main siddhu aaj bhi cabinet mantri hai
 The reason behind this is being told that the Punjab government has not issued any notification regarding his resignation
 bijepi ne loksabhaa chunaav ke liye gujarat ke 15 ummidavaaron ke naamon kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 After this, a ruckus has started in Gujarat BJP

 But after the ticket was cut from Surendranagar seat, the MP Devji Fatehpur created a ruckus and threatened to resign from BJP

 Devji Fatehpur expressed his displeasure in front of the media and said that factionalism is going on in the BJP
 bijepi ke jariye jo vichaar jaanane kii koshish kii gai vah sirf ek naatak tha
 Interestingly, Devji Fatepura has been an MLA from Congress twice
 narendra modi jab gujarat ke mukhyamantri the, jab unhen piem pad kaa ummidavaar bataaya gaya iske baad devji fatehpura ne bijepi jwine kii thi or 2014 main saansad chune gaye the
 Friends said that when the time came, your bad days would come after Devtik Fatehpura's anger did not stop here, he also gave advice to the leaders who left the Congress
 haal hi main congress chhod bijepi main aae or cabinet mantri bane kunwarji baawaliya ko lekar unhone kaha ki vakt aane par baawaliya ko bhi pataa chalegaa
 He said that Bavaliya will also have bad days in BJP
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki bijepi ke hi netaa janyati coudia ne meraa tikat kaata he
 Angered by not getting the ticket, Devji Fatehpur has gathered the people of his society in the coming days
 devji fatehpura ne kaha ki samaaj ke log hi faisla lenge ki bijepi main rah kar baghawat kerani he yaa phir congress main janaa chahie
 Within two days, they will take their decision together with the people of the society
 samaaj kahegaa to bijepi se bhi istipha de denge
 Devji Fatehpura has also alleged that Mahendra Munjapara, who has been given the ticket, has not played any important role in the development of Surendra Nagar

 jab desh ke kai rajyon main kisaan andolan kar rahe hon, aise main krishi mantri kaa yun yoga ko protsaahit karnaa sawaal paidaa karata he
 The Agriculture Minister seems to be avoiding speaking anything on the farmer movement

 Taking a dig at the Congress, he said that along with his sins of 60 years, the Prime Minister is implementing the plan for the farmers

 grih mantri rajnath singh ne adiyal rukh apnaane vaale algaavvaadiyon par kaha he ki hurriyat netaaon kaa insaaniyat, kashmiriat or jamhuriyat main koi bharosa nahin he
 Insanity, Kashmiriyat and Jamhooriyat were first talked about by the then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 2003
 haalanki us vakt ghati ke halaat itane kharaab nahin the, jitne abhi
 Vajpayee had said that the future of Kashmir lies in the basic nature of Kashmir, humanity, humanity and democracy
 hijbul aatanki burhan vaani ke maare jane ke baad se kashmir ghati ke halaat saamaanya nahin hai
 In April last, PM Modi had also reiterated Vajpayee's three principles for peace in Kashmir, and now, as part of the initiative to normalize the situation in the Valley, Rajnath Singh went to Kashmir with an all-party delegation and he got the way from the Hurriyat leaders
 It is clear from the answer that the separatists neither want the good of Kashmir nor the country
 algaavvaadi netaaon ne sarvadaleey pratinidhimandal se baat to dur, unase milane se inkaar kar diya
 We say that Kirajnath Singh has rightly said about the separatists that the Hurriyat does not believe in democracy, it does not have any merit
 unka rukh kashmiriat nahin or in algaavvaadiyon main insaaniyat nahin he
 1
 algaavvaadi netaa saiyad ali shah gilaani ke bete naeem gilaani par ghati menatankwadki funding ke aarope lage hai
 The NIA is investigating the accumulation of money for terrorists in all the bank accounts of the Valley from abroad
 aise saboot mili hai ki jammu-kashmir main hinsa bhadakaane ke liye hafiz said ke sanghathan jamaat-ud-daawa or lashkar ne pakistan se bhi paise bheje hai
 2
 july ke pehle hafte main hijbul kaa'poster bvoy'burhan vaani maaraa gaya to hurriyat netaa saiyad ali shah gilaani ne ghati main band kaa aahvaan kiya
 This bandh lasted for more than one and a half months
 hurriyat netaaon ne ghati main shanti bahaali ke liye kadam uthaane bajaay sthaneey logon ko bhadakaane kaa kaam kiya jisase aam janajivan puri tarah prabhavit rahaa
 3
 gilaani or unakihurrietpar sthaneey berozegaar yuvakon ko bahakaakar virodh-pradarshnon main shaamil karte hai
 These protesting youths throw stones at the security forces
 ye patharbaj paise se kharide gaye hote hai
 Many of these young men have revealed that they get up to 400 rupees for a day
 police ko jaanch main pataa chalaa he ki hurriyat netaa gilaani ke samarthak ye fund sthaneey vyapaariyon se ikattha karte hai
 Terrorist organizations in Pakistan also help in financing the stone pelting
 4
 In Srinagar, flags of Pakistan are often waved and anti-india and pro-pakistan slogans are raised after Friday prayers
 haal ke dinon main to aatanki sanghathan iesas ke jhande bhi laharaae gaye or uske samarthan main naare lagaae gaye
 Such incidents also occur in the rallies of separatists
 in sabhi ghatnaon ko na sirf algaavvaadiyon kaa samarthan rahata he, balki aisi sabhaaon main inhen shaamil bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 5
 gilaani or hurriyat ne netaaon ne logon se 2014 main hone vaale jammu-kashmir vidhansabha chunaav kaa bahishkaar karne kii apil kii thi
 Their reasoning was that the Indian government is conducting elections in the state on the basis of guns
 haalanki inaki apil kaa sthaneey janata par koi asar nahin hua or vidhansabha chunaav main record 65 fisadi se bhi zyada voting hui jo beete 25 saal main sabase zyada rahi
 Stonewalling why exerts Hurriyat? What obstacle to peace Netaksmirmen Hurriyat why children are not
 iskaa jawaab he algaavvaadiyon kii wo siyasat, jiske dam par wo kashmir main apana vajood talashte hai
 - The entire politics of these leaders is based on separatism
 - baat karne se ye sandesh jayega ki aman kii koshishon main sarkaar aage he
 - These separatist leaders do not even want to take the risk of offending Pakistan
 - algaavvaadi pakistan ke saath hi aatankwaadiyon ko naaraaz karne kaa khatra bhi nahin uthaa sakate
 In such a situation, they feel that if they go with the efforts of the government, their existence will disappear
 pakistan se khaasaa he yaaranahurriyat ke netaaon ne dilli se srinagar pahunche tamaam dalon ke numaayindon se milane se inkaar kar diya he
 These are the leaders of the same Hurriyat who run to Delhi to attend any Pakistan delegation or to attend every program of the Pakistani High Commission
 pakistani ucchayog har saal pakistan diwas manaata he
 On this occasion, the separatist leaders of Kashmir are also invited
 ye algaavvaadi shaayad hi kabhi pakistani ucchayog ke nyote ko nazarandaaj karte hon

 ONGC is commanding domestic oil production in India in the initial days
 jamini simaaon main or usase pare samudr main bhi iske paas sabase bade tel ke maidan hai jinamein bombai haai bhi shaamil he jo rojaanaa 2,85,000 bairal utpaadan karata he
 The Barmer block produces over two lakh barrels per day
 vanijyik utpaadan ke liye samarpit saat basinon main se chah oengisi ke khole hue hai
 The draft of the Industrial Policy of 1948 included talk of the development of the petroleum sector
 aazaadee se pehle avibhajit bharat main keval do tel utpaadak companiyaan hua karti thim—assam oil or atok
 In 1955, India decided to emulate the Soviet model and established the Directorate of Oil and Natural Gas
 jald hi jawaharlal nehru or unke maatahat prakritik sansaadhan mantri keshav das malviya ko ehsaas hua ki yah model kargar nahin he
 Then in 1956 the Directorate was given the status of Commission
 ayog kaa kaam petroleum sansadhano ke vikaas ke liye kaarykram banane se lekar utpaadon kii bikri bhi tha
 The takeover: The current government aims to cut oil imports by 10 percent by 2022
 matlab, oengisi ko apana utpaadan badhanaa hoga
 The company is also working on the acquisition of PSU HPCL which will strengthen it in all the three dimensions of the oil business
 pichley teen saal main tel ke daam 60 dollar prati bairal ke aasapaas mandara rahe hai or antarrashtriya tel companiyon kaa maananaa he ki aisa lambey samay tak bana rahegaa
 As the gross refining margins and marketing margins of refinery companies have increased, ONGC has a good future in acquisitions

 After this statement, BJP got a chance to attack Congress
 lekin is par javaabi hamalaa karte hue congress ne sawaal kiya he ki upie ke shashan ke dauraan kareeb 3 lakh karod rupee kaa enpie aakhirandieke dauraan 12 lakh karod rupee tak pahunch gaya
 Significantly, former Governor of Reserve Bank of India Raghuram Rajan has put the previous UPA government in the dock in his reply to a committee of Parliament regarding the rising non-performing asset (npa)
the Parliament's Estimates Committee headed by varisht bijepi saansad murali manohar joshi kii adhyakshata vaali sansad kii prakkalan samiti ne rajan ko enpie ke mudde par jaankaree dene ko kaha tha
 BJP did not delay in taking advantage of this opportunity and at a press conference on Tuesday, Union Minister Smriti Irani said, "raghuram Rajan's statement clearly proves that Congress is responsible for rising npas
 ' congress ne iskaa palatwaar karne main deree nahin kii
 The Congress alleged that the total NPA of banks in 2014 during the UPA regime was 2
 83 lakh karod rupee hi tha, lekin aaj yah 12 lakh karod rupee tak pahunch gaya
 Congress leader Randeep Surjewala said, 'I accept that 2 in 2014

 Rajan's warning: Many promoters, while taking advantage of the loophole, Raghuram Rajan also questioned the role of banks, stating that they were overconfident and may not have adequately researched many borrowers

 agar england ke khilaaf is vanade siries main bharat pancho match jeet jaataa he to vanade main team india ban jaaegi number van
 The 1-2 defeat in the three-match ODI series against Pakistan exposed the weak links of the Indian batting, forcing the selectors to dismiss the in-form opener Virender Sehwag and the first three against England
 Local player Cheteshwar Pujara, who is in form for the matches, was included in his squad
 england ke khilaaf chaar maichon kii test shrinkhalaa main mejabaan desh ko 1-2 se karaari shikast mili thi
 Before the start of this ODI series, India registered a consolation win in a low-scoring thriller in the final match of the series against Pakistan in the bitter cold, which was absolutely necessary for Mahendra Singh Dhoni's players
 test shrinkhalaa main jeet dilaane vaale captain elister cook phir england kii aguwai karenge lekin unka gendbaaji akraman anubhavheen dikhataa he, kyonki isamen kai mukhya test gendbaaj maujuud nahin hai
 It can serve as a tonic to return to form for the Indian batting line-up surrounded by criticism
 pakistan ke khilaaf teen maichon main ek shatak or ek ardhashatak se kul 203 ran banane vaale dhoni ko chhodkar bhartiya sheersh kram main sabhi ballebaaj vifal rahe jisamen captain ke baad suresh raina ne 92 ran banaaye or unka sarvshereshth score 43 rahaa
 Opener Gautam Gambhir, his Delhi compatriots Virat Kohli and Yuvraj Singh also flopped against Pakistan and the rival team's fast bowling attack made a big impact on their morale but against the non-experienced fast bowling attack led by Tim Bresnan and Steven Finn These Indian batsmen will have to show a great game, especially when the pitch is suited to the batsmen
 madhavrao sindhiya res course ground apni sapaat pich ke liye mashhoor he or 2008 main yahaan khele gayi pichley vanade main gambhir, sahvaag or yuvaraj ne england ke tej gendbaaji akraman kii dhajjiyaan udaate hue park ke chaaron ore ran banaaye the
 In the current attack, the new ball will be responsible for Bresnan, Finn, Stuart Meeker and Jade Dernbach, which does not look as dangerous compared to the one that Indian batsmen had flown over four years ago
 saurashtra cricket sangh ke sheersh adhikari ne essie stadium kii pich ke bare main kaha ki pakistani gendbaajon ke khilaaf kharaab pradarshan ke baad bhartiya ballebaajon ko ran banaakar aatmavishvaas waapas hasil karte hue dekhnaa acha hoga or yah trek bhi ballebaajon ke mufeed hogi
 It is expected to score over 300 runs
 yah bhi dekhnaa hoga ki karnataka ke khilaaf ranjai trophy quarterfinal match main saurashtra ke liye tihara shatak jadne vaale pujaara ko antim ekadash main shaamil kiya jaayegaa yaa nahin
 The England attack has yet to catch up with the changed ODI rules and field conditions, and his bowling came under severe criticism in the media after the two A-5 matches against Delhi and India
 unhen yahaan bhi trek se koi madad nahin milegi
 Off-spinner James Treadwell achieved some success in these matches and the England team would like to get some help in the middle overs at this ground
 is maidan par pichley ranjai trophy maichon main bada score saamaanya rahaa he, jiskaa pichley ravivaar ko hi adhikarik rup se udghaatan kiya gaya
 In batting, England will depend on Cook, Ian Bell, Kevin Pietersen and Eoin Morgan
 bel ne do abhyaas maichon main ek shatak or 91 ran kii pari kheli thi
 England, as wicketkeeper Craig Kieswetter and Joseph Butler, have the ability to score runs fast
 shami ahamed or bhubaneshwar kumaar ke bharat ke yuva tej gendbaajon kii bhi is pich par kadi pariksha hogi kyonki isse pehle ve pakistan ke khilaaf gendbaajon ke makul halaat main khele the
 These most experienced Ishant Sharma will have to help them
 spin kii jimmedaari aar aswin or ravindra jadeja ke haath main hogi, jinke saath yuvaraj singh bhi unke sahaayak honge
 This series will give India a chance to regain its prestige while England's team can win and strengthen their top position in the ODI rankings
 bhartiya team ke paas bhi sheersh sthaan hasil karne kaa mauka he lekin yah use 5-0 kii clin sweep ke baad hi mil saktaa he, jaisaa usne 2008 main kiya tha
 Like Test series for England, it will be a chance to create history after 28 years by winning ODI series here
 timen is prakaar hai:bharat:mahendra singh dhoni, gautam gambhir, anjikya rahane, cheteshwar pujaara, viraat kohli, rohit sharma, yuvaraj singh, suresh raina, aar aswin, ravindra jadeja, amit mishra, ishanth sharma, bhubaneshwar kumaar, ashok dinda or shami ahamed

 assam bijepi ke ek netaa ke saath pichley disambar main dilli kii ek sard raat chunaav ranneetikaar prashanth kishor kii mulaakaat hui
 Just a month ago, Prashant Kishore had played a role in getting the Lalu Prasad Yadav and Nitish Kumar pair a landslide victory over the BJP in the Bihar assembly elections
 ab ve congress alaakaman or assam ke mukhyamantri tarun gogoi kii agle chaar maheenon main hone vaale assam chunaav main madad karne kii taiyaari kar rahe the
 Then the question arises as to why he met Hemant Biswa Sarma, who had been an aide of Gogoi but joined the BJP in July 2015? Actually, Kishore's wife hails from Assam and is a doctor by profession
 ve sarama kii sahpaathee rah chuki hai
 Kishore had an offer for Sarma: "if you come back to the Congress, you will be made a candidate for the post of Chief Minister
 ” sarama ne kishor kii peshkash thukraa di thi
 So far, the reason is not clear why Kishore quit Assam, but so far in over 200 public meetings and rallies across the state, Sarma has proved that he is the biggest challenge for the Congress in this election
 bijepi ke mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar sarbanand sonoval ne apane kshetra majuli ke baahar 20 sabhaayen kii hai, gogoi 50 sabhaayen kar chuke hai lekin sarama ne 8 april tak apane chunaav kshetra jalukbadi main ek bhi sabha nahin kii thi
 This is the reason that after over 80 per cent voting in the first phase of polling on April 4, party president Amit Shah made the first call to Sarma and wished him all the best for his hard work
 paramparaagat rup se zyada matdaan kii dar badlaav kaa suchak hoti he
 Two days later, when Amit Shah arrived in Assam for four rallies, all the leaders of the state were with him but Sarma was not present
 sarama ne is dauraan nichle assam main paanch or jansabhaayen karke 11 april ko hone vaale duusare charan kii taiyaari puri kar di
 Sonia Gandhi also called a top Congress leader the day Shah called him
 sonia ne unase jaananaa chaha tha ki barpeta or jaagerode naamak nichle assam ke do ahm kshetron main hui jansabhaon main congress adhyaksh ke sarama par kiye gaye sidhe hamale par unki kya raay he
 Assuming that Sarma did not open his tongue against the Congress president and only targeted his son, Sonia's move was considered wrong
 guwahati se 100 kilometre dur paathshaala kii bheedbhad vaali mukhya sadak par apana rasta banaate hue sarama ne india today ko bataaya, “bijepi-agypi-bipief gathbandhan pehle charan main 45 se zyada siten jitegaa
 "the crowd is upset to see and touch them
 is 48 saal ke netaa kii aisi lokapriyata ke peeche ek itihaas haih shiksha mantri rahete sarama ne ek paardarshee niyukti pranali apanaai thi jisaki madad se 60,000 snaatakon ko likhit pariksha ke jariye shikshak kii naukari mili thi
 The BJP hopes that it can be used to draw minority votes
 guwahati ke ek shiksha kaaryakarta shyaamkaanu mahant bataate hai, “gaiyr-rajkeey skulon main karyrat kareeb ek lakh shikshak alpsankhyak samudaayon se hai
 They believe that only Sarma can regularize their employment
 ”shah kii ranneetisharmaa agar bijepi ke morche ko aage se sanbhale hue hai to party adhyaksh shah maheenon pehle hi chunavi ranneeti kaa khaakaa taiyaar kar baithe hai
 Despite tremendous opposition from the RSS, he and Narendra Modi had decided to join Sarma and hand over the election campaign to them
 sarama ko is baat kaa shrey diya jaataa he ki unhone hi agypi or bipief ke saath bijepi kaa gathbandhan karavaaya
 Bringing the AGP along was not easy as its two top leaders, President Atul Bora and former Chief Minister Prafulla Kumar Mahant, were not willing to have any relationship with the BJP
 ranneeti yah thi ki agypi main duusari pankti ke netaaon ko is kaam par lagaaya jaae
 This work was left to the BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav
 unhone agypi ke teen vidhayakon ke ghar ke kai chakkar lagaae
 When the BPF leaders were close to Sarma, it was easy to bring him along
 eiudief kaa labhbijepi ke chunaav prachaar ko sabase badi madad eiudief ke sansthaapak badaruddin ajmal se mil rahi he, jinhen bangladesh ke kathith muslim pravaasiyon ke sabase bade sangrakshak ke taur par dekha jaataa he
 It is repeatedly propagated that Assam has the second largest Muslim population of 35 per cent
 yah baat logon main dar paidaa karti he
 The perfume businessman, 66-year-old Ajmal, has often expressed his desire to become the chief minister or play the role of kingmaker
 rahaa chunaav kshetra ke antargat kosua tiniyaali main ek sabha main asamiya bhashaa main die apane bhaashan main ve kehete hai, “assam main koi bhi dal eiudief kii madad ke bagaiyr sarkaar nahin bana saktaa
 This does not bother BJP
 party ne is jang main ek nayaa aahvaan kiya haih yah saraighat kii aakhri jang he jisamen ajmal kii aguai vaale bahriyon ko baahar phenk diya janaa he
 The naval battle of Saraighat was fought near Guwahati in 1671 in which the Ahomi army defeated the army of Aurangzeb
 sarama is jang ko maati, beti or jati bachaane kii jang kaa naam dete hai
 He says in the school, “we cannot allow Bangladeshi Ajmal to rule the state
 ” chunaav kshetra main musalamaanon kii aabaadi ke hisaab se sarama tay karte hai ki ajmal par hamale ko tikhaa karnaa he yaa halkaa
 According to BJP insiders, this propaganda strategy of "hum Vs Way" was later considered
 shuruaati yojana to satta virdohi maahaul kaa phayda uthaate hue gogoi sarkaar ko nishane par lene kii thi
 The sensitive issue of big dams is not being deliberately touched while in the name of promoting the Gujarat model, Rs 2 for BPL families
 kilo chaaval, mahila swayan sahaayta samoohon ke liye 5 lakh ru
 And here and there, the announcement of district and engineering colleges is being resorted to
 duusari ore, gogoi ko vinaash or avaigh ghuspaithiyon ke sangrakshak ke taur par prachaarit kiya ja rahaa he or iske liye logon main yah dar paidaa kiya ja rahaa he ki congress ajmal ke saath milakar sarkaar bana sakati he
 Ajmal says that he can undoubtedly join the Congress government provided Gogoi and his three aides are removed first
 unhone 21 march ko hue rajyasabha ke chunaav main congress ke ummidavaaron ko bilatiort samarthan de diya tha jabaki uski koi jarurat tak nahin thi
 This led to a lot of criticism by Gogoi
 unhone india today se kaha tha, “eiudief or bijepi kii mileebhagat he
 We did not ask for support but they deliberately supported it so that BJP could get benefit in its propaganda
 ”tikat vitaran main bijepi ne kuch galtiyaan kii hai
 In Rangiya, Bilasipada East, Dhekiajuli, Margherita and Sivasagar, outsiders have been given tickets in place of "winnable" local candidates
 ummidavaar chunane kii jimmedaari sonoval or ram madhav ke saath sarama kii bhi thi
 Sarma defends the decision, "this process was too complicated
 masalan, muslim bahul purv bilsipada main ashok singi ko isliye tikat diya gaya kyonki ek thekedaar hone ke naate 10,000 se zyada muslim mazdooron par unka dabadabaa he
 " aaj desh ke bade-bade akhabaaron main congress kaa vigyaapan chapa jiske jariye rahul gandhi desh ko ye sandesh de rahe hai
 
 
 'we not me'
 vigyaapan saamne aayaa to har kisi ke man ek hi baat thi ki rahul ne chunavi samar kaa aagaaj karte hue ishaaron main bijepi ke piem ummidavaar narendra modi par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 But the shocking thing is that now Congress and Rahul Gandhi are being accused of stealing Modi's slogan
 darasal, bijepi kaa daawa he ki 'main nahin, ham' kaa naaraa modi ne farvari 2011 main hi diya tha
 This campaign of Modi was associated with the works of the Gujarat government
 bijepi ne rahul ke vigyaapan par kaha he ki congress chori karne main maahir he
 They can go to any extent in the circle of defeating Modi
 rahul kaa
 
 
 It is clear from Rahul's advertisement published in newspapers that 'rahul's face is the most important for the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections'
 is poster main sonia or manmohan singh nahin dikhte
 This advertisement is also being seen as a taunt on Modi
 kyonki modi akasar hi 'main, meraa or mujhe' jaise shabdon kaa istemaal karte hai
 Of Narendra Modi
 
 
 'main nahin, ham'sach yah bhi he modi ne farvari 2011 main hi 'main nahin, ham' kaa naaraa diya tha
 This slogan was associated with the Gujarat government campaign
 farvari 2011 ke pehle hafte main mehsana water park main ek chintan shivi kaa aayojan hua tha jisamen modi ne 'main nahin, ham' mudde ko charchaa kaa ahm vishay banaaya tha
 During this time a big poster was also put on the stage on which this slogan was written
 iske alaava team work ko lekar kai chart or poster bhi lage the
 As soon as the BJP accused the Congress of stealing Modi's idea, the war on this dispute intensified
 congress jahaan baikfoot par najar ai vahiin bijepi ne aakraamak taivar apana liye
 No one has a monopoly on slogans: On the charge of stealing the idea of shobha Ojhan Narendra Modi, Congress leader Shobha Ojha said, 'we have always said that we should take everyone along
 agar koi kuch kahata he to usapar uskaa ekadhikaar nahin ban jaataa
 Common man's hand with Congress

 The UPA mantra has been that development should focus on 'us'
 jabaki vipaksh sirf 'main' par focus karata he
 'congress engaged in the task of shouting slogans by removing all ministers: BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain took a dig at this advertisement of BJP
 unhone kaha, 'vigyaapan se hi saaf ho jaataa he ki wo ham nahin sirf main kii baat kar rahe hai
 There is neither Sonia nor PM nor any minister in the poster
 iske alaava yah naaraa to modiji ne 2011 main hi de diya tha
 The Congress has had such a famine of slogans that now they are stealing Modi ji's idea too

 After blaming Dera chief Ram Rahim last Friday, Panchkula saw the 3-hour-long orgy of death, which no one could possibly have imagined

 While imprisoned in the houses, the locals have seen the eyes of those 3 hours of death
 unako yaad kar wo aaj bhi sihar uthte hai
 According to Thamidia reports not believing in the eyes, Mohit, who lives in Sector-2, said, 'his supporters became violent after he was convicted on that day Ram Rahim
 haathon main hathiyaar, lathi-danda lekar deraa samarthak police par patharbaji kar rahe the

 khidki se maine dekha ki ghar ke baahar patharbaji kar raheen do mahilaayein achaanak jameen par gir padi
 Perhaps he was shot
 yah sab dekh mujhe apni ankhon par yakeen nahin ho rahaa tha
 Neelam, who lives in Thesector-4 who enters the house, tells the wall, 'I was at my house
 samarthakon kii bheed mere ghar kii ore aage bad rahi thi
 For a time i felt that these people would enter my house and so did it

 Know how is the condition of prisoner number 1997 mumbai hamalon kii sajeesh rachane ke maamle main giraftaar pakistani canadai naagarik tahawwur rana kii hiraasat kii maang kar rahe sangheey abhiyojkon ne kaha he ki yadi rana ko muchalke par reeha kiya jaataa he to vah desh se bhaagane ke liye khatarnaak aatankwaadi sanghathanon se vittiya madad le saktaa he
 Prosecutors said Rana's name has been named as a conspirator and that he could be sentenced to rigorous life imprisonment in the new charges filed against him
 rana ne apni hiraasat ke aadesh ko radd karne kii maang kii thi
 On his application, prosecutors have given a 33-page government reply, saying that if he is released, he can flee to escape punishment
 abhiyojkon danniel kalins or victoria peters ne 15 janvari ko apana jawaab daakhil kiya tha
 a day earlier, a grand jury on Rana and co-accused David Headley had laid charges in 12 cases of conspiracy to attack in Mumbai and Denmark
 jawaab main kaha gaya he ki rana par atirikt aarope lagaaye gayi hai, jo vastav main or bhi gambhir hai
 Magistrate Naan Nolan denied bail to Rana
 unhone kaha ki yadi use muchalke par reeha kiya jaataa he to vah sambhavit 30 saal kii kaid kii sajaa se bachane ke liye desh se bhaag saktaa he
 However, Rana could now be given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment on charges of conspiring to commit bombings and murders in places of public use in India, which may increase his chances of fleeing the country
 rana yah daleel de rahaa he ki kyonki hedli ab hiraasat main he, isliye ‘‘is tarah kaa koi jokhim nahin dikhaai detaa ki abhiyukt kaa (rana kaa) kathith aacharan doharaaya ja saktaa he
 "prosecutors argued that Rana is not only in touch with Headley but also in direct contact with Abdur Rahman Hashim Syed (pasha), against whom chargesheet was filed but US authorities have not arrested him yet
" 
 sarkaar ke jawaab ke mutabik, ‘‘pasha abhiyukt ke ilyaas kashmiri se sampark kii kadi he, kashmiri pakistan ke sarvaadhik vaanchhiton main se ek he or al kaayda se uskaa sidhaa naata he
 "in the new charge sheet, Rana is in direct contact with a person identified as" Person a "
 abhiyojkon ne kaha, ‘‘yadi rana bhaag jaataa he to vah in antarrashtriya samparkon se na keval aarthik or anya sahaayta hasil kar saktaa he balki yah bhi sach he ki ghaatak aatankwaadi sanghathanon ke sadasyon se uske sampark bhi prativaadee ko hiraasat main lene kaa majbootee se samarthan kar rahe hai
 "rana can be produced before the court on 21 January
" uskaa kahana he ki nolan uski pakistani prishthbhumi se anuchit tareeke se chintit hai
 But prosecutors say the judge is reasonably concerned about his relationship with a terrorist organization based in Pakistan
 chicago kii ek adaalat main 30 disambar ko ek aavedan main rana ne apni hiraasat ke aadesh ko radd karne kii maang kii thi
 Rana, through his lawyer Patrick Blagden, said that because he is a fugitive of the Pakistani army and does not have the financial resources for the international game of hide and seek, he will not flee the country when he is released on bond
 rana ke aavedan main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki yadi vah pakistan yaa canada bhaag bhi jaataa he to america in deshon se apni pratyrpan sandhi kaa istemaal use waapas laane main kar saktaa he

 The water of Narmada is still in Narmada
 lekin pani ke nalon tak pahunchane se pehle hi aaropon kii barsaat tej ho gai he
 The Municipal Corporation had to bear the responsibility of providing drinking water in Khandwa, facing the water crisis, but has given all the responsibility to a specific company under the public-private Partnership (PPP) scheme, laying the foundation for water privatization in the state
 
 khaas baat yah he ki jis pipipi model ko aadhaar banaaya gaya he, usamen nijee company kii ansh puunji 51 fisadi yaa adhik honi chahie
 But the corporation only contributed 100 per cent to the Hyderabad-based company Vishwa Utility Private Limited (106

 Pramod Kumar Sinha, the company's vice president, says the company is operating according to the terms of the agreement
 lekin 10 fisadi main sau fisadi kaa adhikaar milane ke sawaal par sinha kehete hai, ''yah shashan ne hi tay kiya he, company kii isamen koi bhoomika nahin he or jal kar kii daren bhi nigam ne hi tay kii hai

 The scheme was approved in which the Central Government approved 80 and the State 10 percent grant

 67 crores Rs
 nigam ko dene the, lekin usne iske liye pipipi kaa sahaara liya or samoochee yojana vishwa utility ke hawaale kar pallaa jhad liya
 Former corporation mayor Tarachand Agarwal questions the plan, "this work is just Rs 25-30 crore for the corporation
" main kar saktaa tha
 "now the Vishwa Utility will charge 7-8 times more water tax for the next 23 years

 State Congress Committee member Ajay Oj alleges, "khandwa's mayor Bhavna Vijay Shah's husband and the state's Tribal Welfare Minister Vijay Shah instructed the corporation administration that the company would be given three crore rupees for the work

 This can be done from the notesheet of the corporation

 Though hurt by the widespread opposition to the Narmada water scheme, the mayor does not want to talk to the public and the media, she says, "I am seeing how much confusion and leveling is being spread about this plan
" main vakt aane par boluungi
 Vijay Shah, however, refrained from commenting on the case, arguing that his health deteriorated

 Ashok Khandelia, president of the Dewas Industry Association, says, "the GRP pipe burst from place to place as soon as the pipe was released, and the pipeline from which 30 MLD water was to come, never got 5-6 MLD water and today The industries of Dewas are also craving water
 ''pipe ke maamle par company kaa kahana he, ''aane vaale 23 varshon tak jal pradaay kaa jimmaa company kaa he or koi bhi dikkat aati he to company kii javabdehi hogi

 Village resident Mo

 aakhir aisa kyon? iskaa tark in donon votaron ke paas nahin he
 Sharafat says, "I will not cheat Lohia till death, i will press the button of the cycle whatever happens
 '' duusari taraf musalamin kehete hai, '' ek baar jo bhaajapa kaa daaman thama he, ab gaddari nahin karunga
