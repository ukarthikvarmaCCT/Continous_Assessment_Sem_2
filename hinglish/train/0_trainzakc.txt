 ) india today conklev east ke 10wein seshan main joardaar bahes hui
 In the debate, Indian Statistical Institute Kegarga Chatterjee favored TMC, while Malini Bhattacharya of All India Democratic Women's Association lobbied for CPI-M
 bahes main pashchimbengalabijepi ke upaadhyaksh jai prakaash majumdaar ne apni party kaa paksh rakhaa
 In the debate, Garga Chatterjee, while giving opinion on the recent riots in West Bengal, said a reference to a study of Yale University
 unhone kaha ki is study ke mutabik bhartiya up mahadweep main dangon se sirf ek party ko phayda pahunchataa he or wo party he bhartiya janata party
 He said that whichever incitement of violent violence will benefit only the BJP
 isliye pashchim bengal main isi formule par kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 Garga warned the BJP that the people of West Bengal would openly contest this conspiracy of the BJP
 unhone kaha, "hamen yaad rakhana chahie ki bengal main hamaari maa ke do pair hai, chaar pair nahin, or bijepi ko yaad rakhana chahie ki unki maa ke paas koi haath nahin hai, jabaki hamaari maa ke paas das haath hai, in das haathon se ham bengal ke khilaaf banaaye gayi har tarah ke shadyantra kaa khaatmaa karenge
 "attending the debate, BJP leader Jai Majumdar said on the riots in West Bengal that this is a conspiracy of the ruling party for votes
 jai majumdaar ne kaha, "is rajya main sattadhari party dwaara, sattadhari party ke liye sampradayik vaimnasy paidaa kiya ja rahaa he
 He said that if outsiders are involved in the riots in West Bengal, then why do the police here not arrest such elements? After all, what does law and order mean? Referring to Marx, he said that he had described religion as opium for the public, but Mamata made religion a vote bank, whereas Modi describes religion as the back bone of society, that is the difference of ideology
 malini bhattacharya ne tiemasi par hamalaa bolte hue sawaal khadaa kiya ki aakhir pashchim bengal main RSS kaa udai kaise hua, is sanghathan ne yahaan apane paanv kaise pasaare? kaise aayi, kya tiemasi ise nahin roak sakati thi? malini ne kaha ki jab tak left pashchim bengal main satta main thi bijepi kaa vajood to rajya main tha, lekin party haashiye par padi thi
 He said that there is an upper-class political rivalry between the TMC and the BJP, but both parties are mixed in from inside
 unhone kaha ki donon hi partiyaan janata main khauf paidaa karti hai or ek khaas samooh ko suraksha dene kaa bharosa detii hai
 He admitted that CPI-M has lost votes due to such politics, as CPI-M fights for the rights of the people
 more than 100 places in Canada 
 sthaneey adhikariyon ne kal ek taaja report main bataaya ki keval saskaichwan main 118 jagahon par aag lag gai he, jinamein se 20 jagahon par lagi aag ko adhikariyon se niyantran se baahar bataaya he
 Military forces are arriving in the province and the Canadian government has said that it will send 1400 personnel, including a fire force
 13,000 se adhik log apane gharon se saikadon kilometre dur saamudayik kendron main rah rahe hai
 He was evicted a week ago
 saskaichwan ke garvanment relations ministar gym reater ne kaha, yah unke liye bahut mushkil he
 He said that due to the changing weather conditions, the date of return of people is not fixed
 saskaichwan ke alaava do anya praant bhi jangal main aag kii samasya se jujh rahe hai
 Reiter said the problem was aggravated by unusual droughts and high temperatures
 british cambodia main lagbhag har roj nai jagah par aag lagane kii ghoshnaa kii ja rahi he or rocky mountain ilaake se logon ko baahar nikalne kii salaah di gai he
 The comments damakalkarmiyon ne vainkuvar ke uttar main 500 kilometre dur sthit ilaake se logon ko baahar nikaalnaa shuru kar diya he

 The biggest statement our negligent system has is that the culprits will not be spared
 sibiesai kii pariksha ke prashn patr li hue or radd hue magar chaatr to kai prashn patron ke li hone kii baat kah rahe hai
 The students whose areas were not stolen, the question papers were not leaked, the students do not yet understand what they have been punished
 jab imhataan karaane kii kshamta nahin he to phir dasvin kii pariksha karaane kii jaldi hi kya thi
 When it comes to an examination, it is to be believed that the culprits will not be spared, but here, the culprits of every other examination make you guilty by begging the people sitting in power, in the sense that it was your mistake that you Sat on believing vyapam ke doshi aaj tak gum rahe hai
 Investigation is going on, hearing is going on, so when someone says that the perpetrators will be punished severely, then 2 lakh parents consider themselves guilty and assume that you have been punished
 bahut se mata pita or chaatr hamen email kar rahe hai ki unhen kis tarah kii pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 At Jantar Mantar, some parents and students shouted slogans against the leaking of question papers

 Many times when we do prime time, then reading the news, we realize that this news is actually something else
 28 march ke prime time main hamane uttarakhand ke privet medical kalege kii fees kii khabar dikhaai thi
 The way the HR Minister was not able to sleep overnight when the question paper was leaked, not in the same way, but as long as he woke up, he kept thinking that it is economic slavery
 ye aarthik gulaami nahin he to or kya he
 If you take admission in a medical college, then it is known that its fees range from 7 lakh to 23 lakh
 aap ab bich main padhai chhod nahin sakate or lone liya to wo aapaki kshamta se baahar hoga, lihaaza ab kalege main padhane ke dauraan gulam to banenge hi uske baad bhi vahi haalat hogi
 They take an education loan but do not understand how to pay a fee of 7 lakh to 23 lakh
 kya in chaatro se sab kuch bikwa kar hadap lene kaa yah intazaam he, agar aisa he to ise hi aarthik ghulaami kehete hai kyonki ab agar isse mukti chahenge to unhen kalege chhodane ke liye 60 lakh dene honge
 Many viewers said that there is a private medical college, children of money study
 jinke yahaan blike mani hoti he
 This is the assumption
 privet medical kalege main kuch siten paise vaale kharid lete hai magar yah kahana ki saare bachche aise hi hai, galat hoga
 So we questioned many parents and students about which financial category you belong to
 pataa chalaa ki ye sab neet kii pravesh pariksha main achche number laane vaale saadhaaran gharon ke chaatr hai
 He did not take admission in other private colleges because there was a fee of 7 lakhs and the fees of private medical colleges in Uttarakhand was 5 lakhs
 bahut se chaatr behad saadhaaran parivaar ke hai
 It is now difficult for them to take loans
 jis tarah se fees badhaai gai he wo amanviya he
 It will not be easy for any ordinary family to arrange fees ranging from 30 lakh to 40 lakh within two months
 inhen pataa hota ki ek saal kii fees 23 lakh ho jaaegi to yahaan aate hi nahin
 After all, how can a government allow a private medical college to increase the 400% fee
 iske virodh main medical kalege ke 650 chaatr dharne par baithe hai
 Half of them are from Uttarakhand
 unka bhi becoground bahut saadhaaran he
 The general audience gave the first response in the same way that if they belong to private medical college then they are from rich families, so you can give 30 to 40 lakh rupees in two months
 magar ab aap samaj sakate hai ki inke saath anyaay ho rahaa he
 They are not financially capable
 20 lakh kii fees nahin de sakate hai
 You know that in Uttarakhand, the government has given permission to increase the fees to private medical colleges, due to which the fees for the first, second and third years of MBBS have been increased in such a way that you will get dizzy
 - pehle saal kii fees 6 lakh 70 hazaar se badhaakar 23 lakh kar di gai he - The fee for the second year has been increased from 7 lakh 25 thousand to 20 lakh - tisare saal kii fees 7 lakh 36 hazaar se badhkar 26 lakh kar di gai he Not only this, the students who have reached the second year will be charged the arrears of the first year i
e
 they will have to pay 40 lakh rupees
 koi bhi itani fees nahin de saktaa
 This is very big news at this time
 agar sarkaar ne is par dhyaan nahin diya to ye maa baap apane bacchon ko doctor banane ke liye barbaad ho jaaenge
 Most of them belong to ordinary families
 kaha ja rahaa he ki chaatro se halafanama liya gaya tha kalege jo fees tay karegaa deni hogi
 Everybody signs up at the time of admission but no one can think that the fee will be increased from 6 lakhs directly to 22 lakhs
 aap samaj sakate hai ki maa baap or chaatro par is vakt kya biit rahi hogi
 a mother does not understand where she will bring the fees of 41 lakhs till May 31 because both her children study there
 kai logon ko lagegaa ki yah mazaaq he, sabake paas paise hote hai bas zaraa ek baar aap khud ko inaki jagah rakhkar soch lijie, kya aap saat lakh kii jagah 23 lakh kii fees dena chahenge
 Some parents have said that even if they sell their house repeatedly, they cannot give so much money

 Guru Ram Rai was the seventh Sikh son of Guru Har Rai Ji
 unhone 1676 main apana deraa panth kaayam kiya tha
 It was named Dehradun under the name of Dera a Dun
 yahaan har saal dharmik mela lagata he
 The Education Mission of Guru Ram Rai Trust runs more than 150 Hindi and English medium schools in the name of Guru Ram Rai
 nursing kalege hai, krishi kalege hai, sanskrit kalege hai, degree kalege hai, ek hajaar bed kaa aspataal he
 There is a medical college with 150 seats
 arabon kii sampatti he
 There is no shortage of money
 phir bhi medical kalege kii fees 6 lakh 70 hazaar se badhaakar 23 lakh kar di gai he
 Dinesh says that he himself has done background checks of many children, no one can pay such a fee
 awwal to 6 lakh kii fees hi baari thi magar 23 lakh to parmaanu visphot ke samaan he
 i cannot see their status, after all, how has the government allowed to increase the fees by 400 percent
 dinesh mansera kaa kahana he ki guru ram raay medical kalege yaa trust kii taraf se koi bolne ko taiyaar nahin he
 Even then, Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna Vishwavidyalaya Vice Chancellor, who himself went to the High Court to increase the fees
 hoicourt ne kaha ki sarkaar kii gathit cameti fees kaa faisla karegi lekin cameti ke bajaae sarkaar ke cabinet ne faisla kar liya
 The case is not about one college but three private colleges
 uttarakhand kii yah fees vruddhi bhayaavah he
 Anand Rai, who fought against rigging in the medical entrance examination in Madhya Pradesh, said that there is no 20 lakh fee in his state
 pichley saal neet kii post graduate pariksha main jo prashn patr li hua tha, us maamle main bhi anand raay ne dilli hoicourt main yachikakarta hai
 Not only this, the fees of post graduates have been increased from 10 lakh to thirty lakh per year
 chaatro ke messej sunaane laguun to aap sun nahin paaenge
 Their sleep is gone
 ye sabhi middle class becoground se aate hai
 Somehow, once i took a loan that the doctors would become, but they did not know that the fees were reduced to 23 lakhs instead of 6 lakhs and 30 lakhs to 10 lakhs
 hamaara vipaksh so rahaa he, sarkarein laaparvaah ho gayi hai varna itani zyaadaati to koi nashe main bhi nahin karata
 Don't you think that injustice is being done to these students
 jaan dene kii koi zarurat nahin, magar koi laaparvaah mantri bhi is sho ko dekh rahaa he to use ek baar ke liye sochna chahie
 It should not be unfair to these students
 ye saraasar aarthik gulaami he

 chunauti dene vaale chaatr ko har sawaal ke liye 100 rupee dene honge yani is baar 1500 rupee har chaatr ko dene padenge tab jaakar ve un 15 prashnon ko chunauti de sakenge
 This model of earning from the unemployed is amazing

 Many times when we do prime time, then reading the news, we realize that this news is actually something else
 28 march ke prime time main hamane uttarakhand ke privet medical kalege kii fees kii khabar dikhaai thi
 The way the HR Minister was not able to sleep overnight when the question paper was leaked, not in the same way, but as long as he woke up, he kept thinking that it is economic slavery
 ye aarthik gulaami nahin he to or kya he
 If you take admission in a medical college, then it is known that its fees range from 7 lakh to 23 lakh
 aap ab bich main padhai chhod nahin sakate or lone liya to wo aapaki kshamta se baahar hoga, lihaaza ab kalege main padhane ke dauraan gulam to banenge hi uske baad bhi vahi haalat hogi
 They take an education loan but do not understand how to pay a fee of 7 lakh to 23 lakh
 kya in chaatro se sab kuch bikwa kar hadap lene kaa yah intazaam he, agar aisa he to ise hi aarthik ghulaami kehete hai kyonki ab agar isse mukti chahenge to unhen kalege chhodane ke liye 60 lakh dene honge
 Many viewers said that there is a private medical college, children of money study
 jinke yahaan blike mani hoti he
 This is the assumption
 privet medical kalege main kuch siten paise vaale kharid lete hai magar yah kahana ki saare bachche aise hi hai, galat hoga
 So we questioned many parents and students about which financial category you belong to
 pataa chalaa ki ye sab neet kii pravesh pariksha main achche number laane vaale saadhaaran gharon ke chaatr hai
 He did not take admission in other private colleges because there was a fee of 7 lakhs and the fees of private medical colleges in Uttarakhand was 5 lakhs
 bahut se chaatr behad saadhaaran parivaar ke hai
 It is now difficult for them to take loans
 jis tarah se fees badhaai gai he wo amanviya he
 It will not be easy for any ordinary family to arrange fees ranging from 30 lakh to 40 lakh within two months
 inhen pataa hota ki ek saal kii fees 23 lakh ho jaaegi to yahaan aate hi nahin
 After all, how can a government allow a private medical college to increase the 400% fee
 iske virodh main medical kalege ke 650 chaatr dharne par baithe hai
 Half of them are from Uttarakhand
 unka bhi becoground bahut saadhaaran he
 The general audience gave the first response in the same way that if they belong to private medical college then they are from rich families, so you can give 30 to 40 lakh rupees in two months
 magar ab aap samaj sakate hai ki inke saath anyaay ho rahaa he
 They are not financially capable
 20 lakh kii fees nahin de sakate hai
 You know that in Uttarakhand, the government has given permission to increase the fees to private medical colleges, due to which the fees for the first, second and third years of MBBS have been increased in such a way that you will get dizzy
 - pehle saal kii fees 6 lakh 70 hazaar se badhaakar 23 lakh kar di gai he - The fee for the second year has been increased from 7 lakh 25 thousand to 20 lakh - tisare saal kii fees 7 lakh 36 hazaar se badhkar 26 lakh kar di gai he Not only this, the students who have reached the second year will be charged the arrears of the first year i

 Most of them belong to ordinary families
 kaha ja rahaa he ki chaatro se halafanama liya gaya tha kalege jo fees tay karegaa deni hogi
 Everybody signs up at the time of admission but no one can think that the fee will be increased from 6 lakhs directly to 22 lakhs
 aap samaj sakate hai ki maa baap or chaatro par is vakt kya biit rahi hogi
 a mother does not understand where she will bring the fees of 41 lakhs till May 31 because both her children study there
 kai logon ko lagegaa ki yah mazaaq he, sabake paas paise hote hai bas zaraa ek baar aap khud ko inaki jagah rakhkar soch lijie, kya aap saat lakh kii jagah 23 lakh kii fees dena chahenge
 Some parents have said that even if they sell their house repeatedly, they cannot give so much money

 This is the condition of Bihar which the leaders and the youth behind them have gone mad to ignite the riots
 chaatro kii itani haalat kharaab he ki ve kisase kahen
 There are still 43 seats vacant and no restoration
 isliye hamane kai maa baap or chaatro se poochtacha kii ki aap kis aarthik shrenee ke hai
 It turned out that all of them are students from ordinary homes who bring good numbers in NEET entrance exams
 inhone duusare privet kalege main isliye admician nahin liya kyonki vahaan 7 lakh kii fees thi or uttarakhand ke privet medical kalejon kii fees 5 lakh thi
 Many students belong to a very simple family
 unke liye ab lone lenaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 The way the fees have been increased is inhuman
 kisi bhi saadhaaran parivaar ke liye do maheene ke bheetar 30 lakh se lekar 40 lakh tak kii fees kaa intazaam karnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 They would have known that the fees for one year would be 23 lakh, then they would not come here
 aakhir koi sarkaar kisi privet medical kalege ko 400 percent fees badhaane kii anumati kaise de sakati he
 In protest, 650 students of medical colleges are sitting on a dharna
 inamen se aadhe uttarakhand ke hi hai
 Their background is also very simple
 aam darshakon ne pehali pratikriya isi tarah se di ki privet medical kalege ke hai to amir gharaanon ke hai isliye do maheene main 30 se 40 lakh rupee de sakate hai
 But now you can understand that injustice is being done to them
 ye aarthik rup se sakasham nahin hai
 Can not pay a fee of 20 lakhs
 aap jaanate hai ki uttarakhand main sarkaar ne privet medical kalege ko fees badhaane kii chhot de di he jiske kaaran embibies ke pratham, dwitiya or tritiy varsh kii fees is tarah badi he ki sunakar aap chakkar kha jaaenge
 - First year fees have been increased from 6 lakh 70 thousand to 23 lakh - duusare saal kii fees 7 lakh 25 hazaar se badhaakar 20 lakh kar di gai he - The fees for the third year has been increased from 7 lakh 36 thousand to 26 lakh yahi nahin jo chaatr duusare varsh main pahunch chuke hai unase pehle saal kii bakaayaa raashi lee jaaegi yani unhen 40 lakh rupee dene padenge
 No one can pay such a fee
 yah is vakt kii bahut badi khabar he
 If the government does not pay attention to this then these parents will be doomed to make their children a doctor
 inamen se zyaadaatar saadhaaran pariwaron ke hai
 It is being said that an affidavit was taken from the students that the college will fix the fees
 admician ke vakt har koi sin kar detaa he lekin koi yah nahin soch saktaa ki 6 lakh se sidhe badhaakar fees 22 lakh kar di jaaegi
 You can understand what will be happening on parents and students at this time
 ek maa ko samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki 31 may tak 41 lakh kii fees kahaan se laakar denge kyonki uske donon bachche vahaan padhate hai
 Many people will think that this is a joke, everyone has money, just think once you put yourself in their place, would you like to pay a fee of 23 lakh instead of seven lakh
 kuch maa baap ne kaha he ki agar ve apana ghar baar bech bhi den tab bhi itnaa paisa nahin de sakate hai
 Should not the Minister of Human Resources to the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand take initiative on this crisis
 kuch ne to pradhanmantri ko bhi patr likhaa he
 Our colleague Dinesh Mansera told that Guru Ram Rai Medical College is run by a very prestigious trust
 guru ram raay sikhon ke saatven ve guru har raay ji ke putr the
 He established his camp in 1676
 deraa e doon ke naam se iskaa naam dehradun padaa
 Religious fair is held here every year
 guru ram raay trust ke ajukeshan mishan ke kareeb 150 se zyaada guru ram raay ke naam se hindi or english medium skool chalate hai
 There are nursing colleges, agricultural colleges, Sanskrit colleges, degree colleges, a thousand bed hospital
 150 seat vaala medical kalege he
 There is a wealth of billions
 paise kii koi kami nahin he
 Nevertheless, the fees of the medical college has been increased from 6 lakh 70 thousand to 23 lakh
 dinesh kaa kahana he ki unhone bhi khud kai bacchon kii prishthbhumi check kii he, koi bhi itani fees nahin de saktaa
 The fee of 6 lakh was the highest, but 23 lakh is like a nuclear explosion
 mujhase inaki sthiti dekhi nahin ja rahi he, aakhir sarkaar ne kaise 400 fisadi fees badhaane kii anumati di he
 Dinesh Mansera says that no one is ready to speak on behalf of Guru Ram Rai Medical College or Trust
 saamne aae bhi to hemavathi nandan bahuguna vishvavidlaay ke vaais chancelar jo khud fees badhaane ke liye hoicourt gaye the
 The High Court said that the committee constituted by the government will decide the fees, but instead of the committee, the cabinet of the government decided
 maamla ek kalege kaa nahin balki teen privet kalege kaa he
 This fee increase of Uttarakhand is frightening
 madhya pradesh main medical pravesh pariksha main dhaandhlee ke khilaaf ladane vaale anand raay ne bataaya ki unke rajya main bhi 20 lakh fees nahin he
 Anand Rai is also a petitioner in the Delhi High Court in the question paper that was leaked in the neet's post graduate examination last year
 yahi nahin post graduate kii fees 10 lakh se tees lakh prati varsh kar di gai he
 You will not be able to hear the messages of the students
 unki neend ud gai he
 They all come from the middle class background
 kisi tarah ek baar lone le liya ki doctor to ban jaaenge magar unhen nahin pataa tha ki 6 lakh kii jagah 23 lakh or 10 lakh kii jagah 30 lakh fees ho gai
 Our opposition is sleeping, governments have become careless or else nobody gets drunk so much
 kya aapako nahin lagata ki in chaatro ke saath ninsaphi ho rahi he
 No need to die, but if a careless minister is watching this show then he should think for a time
 in chaatro ke saath ye ninsaphi nahin honi chahie
 This is sheer economic slavery
 tippaniyan On 18 February 2018, Madhya Pradesh Public Service Commission took the exam for 200 posts, in which more than 5 lakh students appeared
 is pariksha main 15 aise sawaal the jo yaa to galat the yaa unke do do jawaab banate the
 If the students created a ruckus, 5 questions have been deleted, but the students say that there is a risk of injustice to them
 phir se puri pariksha honi chahie
 There is a stay from the High Court but it is not enough
 ye chaatr indore ke bhavarakuan ilaake main dharne par chaar dinon se baithe hai, 29 march ko vahaan se madhya pradesh lok seva ayog tak march bhi nikaala
 Madhya Pradesh has another rule
 agar aapako lagata he ki pariksha main poocha gaya prashn galat he to har chaatr ko chunauti deni hogi
 The challenging student will have to pay 100 rupees for every question, that is, this time 1500 rupees will have to be given to every student, then they will be able to challenge those 15 questions
 berojgaaron se kamaane kaa yah model kamaal kaa he
 Explains that the place of logic in society and the system has always ended forever
 bihar main ek naukari kaa kissa bataata hum
 On 4 August 2016, 234 Junior Engineer vacancies were released
 ek saal ke kantrect ke liye yah naukari thi
 Two years have passed yet complete restoration has not taken place
 ye bihar kii haalat he jise dangon main phoonk dene ke liye netaa or unke peeche yuva pagal ho gaye hai
 The students are in such a bad condition that they tell them
 abhi bhi 43 seat khaali he or bahaali nahi hui he
 The general audience gave the first response in the same way that if they belong to private medical college then they are from rich families, so you can give 30 to 40 lakh rupees in two months
 magar ab aap samaj sakate hai ki inke saath anyaay ho rahaa he
 They are not financially capable
 20 lakh kii fees nahin de sakate hai
 You know that in Uttarakhand, the government has given permission to increase the fees to private medical colleges, due to which the fees for the first, second and third years of MBBS have been increased in such a way that you will get dizzy

 Not only this, the fees of post graduates have been increased from 10 lakh to thirty lakh per year
 chaatro ke messej sunaane laguun to aap sun nahin paaenge
 Their sleep is gone
 ye sabhi middle class becoground se aate hai
 Somehow, once i took a loan that the doctors would become, but they did not know that the fees were reduced to 23 lakhs instead of 6 lakhs and 30 lakhs to 10 lakhs
 hamaara vipaksh so rahaa he, sarkarein laaparvaah ho gayi hai varna itani zyaadaati to koi nashe main bhi nahin karata
 Don't you think that injustice is being done to these students
 jaan dene kii koi zarurat nahin, magar koi laaparvaah mantri bhi is sho ko dekh rahaa he to use ek baar ke liye sochna chahie
 It should not be unfair to these students
 ye saraasar aarthik gulaami he
 The comments 18 farvari 2018 ko madhya pradesh lokseva ayog ne 200 padon ke liye pariksha lee thi jisamen 5 lakh se adhik chaatr shaamil hue the
 In this exam, there were 15 such questions which were either wrong or made two answers
 chaatro ne hangaamaa kiya to 5 prashnon ko dilit kar diya gaya he magar chaatr kehete hai ki isse unke saath ninsaphi hone kaa khatara he
 There should be a complete examination again
 hai court se ste to he magar wo kaaphi nahin he
 These students have been sitting on dharna in Bhanwarkuan area of indore for four days, on March 29, they also took a march from there to Madhya Pradesh Public Service Commission
 madhya pradesh main ek or niyam he
 If you feel that the question asked in the exam is wrong then every student will have to challenge
 chunauti dene vaale chaatr ko har sawaal ke liye 100 rupee dene honge yani is baar 1500 rupee har chaatr ko dene padenge tab jaakar ve un 15 prashnon ko chunauti de sakenge
 This model of earning from the unemployed is amazing

 i tell a story about a job in Bihar
 4 agast 2016 ko 234 junior ejeeniyar kii vekainsee nikali
 It was a job for a one-year contract
 do saal biit gaye hai abhi tak puri bahaali nahin hui he
 This is the condition of Bihar which the leaders and the youth behind them have gone mad to ignite the riots
 chaatro kii itani haalat kharaab he ki ve kisase kahen
 There are still 43 seats vacant and no restoration
 - pehle saal kii fees 6 lakh 70 hazaar se badhaakar 23 lakh kar di gai he - The fee for the second year has been increased from 7 lakh 25 thousand to 20 lakh - tisare saal kii fees 7 lakh 36 hazaar se badhkar 26 lakh kar di gai he Not only this, the students who have reached the second year will be charged the arrears of the first year i
e
 they will have to pay 40 lakh rupees
 koi bhi itani fees nahin de saktaa
 This is very big news at this time
 agar sarkaar ne is par dhyaan nahin diya to ye maa baap apane bacchon ko doctor banane ke liye barbaad ho jaaenge
 Most of them belong to ordinary families
 kaha ja rahaa he ki chaatro se halafanama liya gaya tha kalege jo fees tay karegaa deni hogi
 Everybody signs up at the time of admission but no one can think that the fee will be increased from 6 lakhs directly to 22 lakhs
 aap samaj sakate hai ki maa baap or chaatro par is vakt kya biit rahi hogi
 a mother does not understand where she will bring the fees of 41 lakhs till May 31 because both her children study there
 kai logon ko lagegaa ki yah mazaaq he, sabake paas paise hote hai bas zaraa ek baar aap khud ko inaki jagah rakhkar soch lijie, kya aap saat lakh kii jagah 23 lakh kii fees dena chahenge
 Some parents have said that even if they sell their house repeatedly, they cannot give so much money
 kya is sankat par maanav sansaadhan mantri se lekar uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri ko pahal nahin kerani chahie
 Some have even written a letter to the Prime Minister

 Our opposition is sleeping, governments have become careless or else nobody gets drunk so much

 The challenging student will have to pay 100 rupees for every question, that is, this time 1500 rupees will have to be given to every student, then they will be able to challenge those 15 questions

 We have done a cover story on Sachin Tendulkar ten times in India Today
 vah iklauti gairraajnneetik shakhsiyat hai, jinhen itani baar cover mila
 Talking about the need for this conclave, Sachin's wife and brother also reached, Kali Puri said, "after so many programs, why such a conference on Sachin after so much was said
 hamane sachin ko record or numbers ke paimaane par dekha he
 But beyond this, they wanted to know about this magnificent man, his thinking, his ways
 iske liye hamane das captainon ko to bulaayaa hi
 Those two people were also called, without whom it would not have been possible for Sachin to do so much
 sachin kii patni anjali tendulkar or unke bhai ajit tendulkar
 India Today Group is grateful to him for participating in this event
 ham jaanate hai ki is vakt puraa tendulkar parivaar aakhri test kii taiyaariyon ko lekar bahut vyast he
 Kali Puri said, 'no matter how much we talk about Sachin, how much is written and read and said, it is less
 ye hamaari koshish he is sachin utsav main apni shirkat dikhaane kii
 'boria Majumdar, who wrote two new stories about Sachin, autobiography, also narrated two interesting stories related to Sachin
 unhone bataaya, 'sachin ke tennis albo kii surgery chal rahi thi
 He got up in the middle and said that i hope you have not moved the blade on the other side of the palm
 kyonki main usase bat pakadta hum
 The doctors got angry and said that the brother would not be able to have surgery like this
 aapako waapas letnaa hoga
 'boria told another anecdote
 sachin ke pehle coach ramakant aachrekar ne unhen koching ke liye manaa kar diya tha
 He did not find anything special in Sachin's game

 Indian intelligence agencies suspect that intruders present in India may be easy prey for anti-india activities on the isi's co-operation
 grih mantralay kii report se ye khulaasa hua he ki pichley teen varshon main bharat-pakistan or bharat-bangladesh kii seemaa par se 15 hajaar se adhik avaidh ghuspaithiyon ko giraftaar kiya ja chukaa he
 Accurate information on the number of intruders has not been given in the Lok Sabha in a written reply to the Ministry of Home Affairs that the illegal infiltration of Bangladeshi nationals in India is a matter of intransigence
 loksabhaa main kiran rigiju ne kaha ki chunki avaidh apravasi log chori-chori bina vaid yatra dastavejon ke bharat pravesh karte hai
 Therefore, there is no precise information about the number of Bangladeshis living illegally
 pakistani ghuspaithiyon ke hone kii khufia jaankarivahingrih mantralayane avaidh pakistani nagarikon ke bare main likhit jawaab main kaha, 'khufia jaankariyon se pataa chalaa he ki pichley teen varshon ke dauraan 140 se adhik pakistani ghuspaithiyon ke sanket mili hai
 'more than 15,000 illegal Bangladeshi infiltrators arrested In a written reply, the Ministry of Home Affairs said that as per the available information more than 15,000 illegal Bangladeshi infiltrators were arrested during the last three years and the current financial year
 vahiin in teen varshon main 1750 se adhikbangladeshi nagarikonko desh se nirvasit kiya gaya
 Also, over a hundred Pakistani intruders were apprehended during the same period, of which around 50 intruders were handed over to the Pakistani Rangers
 bharat virdohi gatividhiyon main shaamil hone kaa shakagrih mantralay ne loksabhaa main kaha he ki jo avaidh apravasi hai, un par shaq he ki ye avaidh apravasi islamic kattarwad kii ore samvedansheel ho sakate hai
 It was said that people living illegally can easily get involved in anti-india activities at the behest of insurgency and Pakistan's intelligence agency
 kya is loksabhaa chunaav main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh yani aresas bijepi or narendra modi ke saath vaise khulkar saath nahin aa rahaa he jaise ki pichley loksabhaa chunaav main aayaa tha? kya aresas ke swayamsevak modi sarkaar ke kaamkaaj se khush nahin hai? kya aresas ke samarthan ke bina modi kii naiya dub rahi he? kam se kam bispi pramukh mayawati kaa to yahi daawa he
 His attitude suddenly shows immense aggression for the BJP and especially for PM Modi
 yah pichley ek hafte main zyada tej hui he
 Today he introduced a new maneuver
 yah aresas or bijepi ke rishton ko lekar he
 But the experts reject Mayawati's claim
 unke mutabik sangh or bijepi ke bich kii patali lakeer ab kareeb-kareeb mit chuki he
 Now the Sangh openly works in favor of BJP
 sirf dilli kii hi baat karen to yahaan kareeb gyaarah hajaar swayamsevakon ne choti-choti sattar hajaar baithak kar bijepi ke paksh main maahaul banaaya
 Union officials have openly appealed against NOTA
 iske alaava sangh ne logon se sau pratishat matdaan kii apil bhi kii
 In Delhi, the Sangh distributed leaflets that counted the achievements of the Modi government in the last five years
 jinamein rashtriya suraksha, saanskrithik uplabdhiyaan or saamaajik suraksha ke mudde shaamil hai
 The decision to field Sadhvi Pragya Thakur against Digvijay Singh in Bhopal is being considered by the RSS to bring the Congress to the forefront on the so-called saffron terrorism
 bijepi ke varisht netaa bhi mayawati kaa daawa sire se khaarij kar rahe hai
 Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh says that RSS is not a political organization, it is a social organization
 lekin unhone kaha to yah loktantric adhikaar he
 Let the results of the election come
 sab pataa chal jayega
 Those who are immersed in their own self are telling themselves about the other
 mayawati isse pehle piem modi par vyaktigat hamalaa kar chuki hai jisaki tamaam bijepi netaaon ne jamkar ninda kii thi
 In this election, there has been allegations of nexus between the BSP and the BJP in a tongue-tied manner
 jis tarah upi main sapa-basapa gathbandhan se congress ko dur rakhaa gaya uske peeche bhi mayawati hi maani gayi
 But now new equations are seen forming
 enditivi ko intervyuu main rahul mayawati ko rashtriya pratik bataa chuke hai
 Akhilesh Yadav is his prime ministerial candidate
 ve khud bhi ishaara kar chuki hai ki agar jarurat padi to pradhanmantri banane ke baad loksabhaa chunaav ambedkar nagar se lard lengi
 In such a situation, his aggression towards the BJP and the Sangh could also be a signal to other opposition parties
 to sawaal he kya sangh ko ghasitkar mayawati bijepi ko alag-thalag karnaa chaah rahi he? kya piem banane kaa mayawati kaa iraadaa puraa hoga? In a crucial match played under the FIFA World Cup 2014, Chile defeated Australia 3–1

 bhartiya janata party ke matra sanghathan rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ne aam aadmi party par chaunkaane vaala bayaan diya he
 When asked about the party's opinion, the organization's general secretary Suresh Bhaiyaji Joshi said that the Sangh will support any organization or political party that is capable of fighting corruption
 unhone kaha, haalanki yah baat samay ke saath hi sabit hogi ki koun sahi he or koun galat
 The 'BJP will resolve Varanasi dispute' The Sangh also gave an opinion on the ongoing fighting in the BJP over the Varanasi seat
 bhaiyaji joshi ne bataaya ki sangh seat par daavedaari ko lekar narendra modi or murali manohar joshi ke bich khabaron main aae vivaad ko lekar chintit he, lekin use vishwaas he ki party is mudde kaa samaadhaan nikaal legi
 Suresh Bhaiyaji Joshi told reporters on the last day of the three-day meeting of the All India Representative Assembly of Bangalore RSS, 'we are worried or not
 hamen lagata he ki unke (bijepi ke) paas is lihaaj se paryaapt anubhav he jise ham pehle bhi kai baar dekh chuke hai
 They are able to solve the problem
 'varanasi se ummidavaari ke mudde par shanivaar ko bijepi kii kendriya chunaav samiti main bhi garmagarm bahes hui
 Sources said that some members demanded clarification on whether Joshi would have to leave Varanasi seat and Modi would contest from there
 khabaron ke mutabik is vishay ko uthaane waalon main khud joshi or varisht netaa sushamaa swaraj shaamil thim
 Jainism is no different from Hinduism
 Should senior leaders like LK Advani contest the election, Bhaiyaji Joshi said that the Sangh cannot give directions to the party but can only convey emotion
 unhone kaha, in chizon ke bare main faisle party karti he
 There is nothing wrong if a person wants to express his opinion
 haalanki joshi ne kaha ki yuvaaon ko maukey milane chahie taaki ve apni urja kaa istemaal raashtra kii seva main kar saken
 Along with this, the guidance of senior leaders should also be benefited
 jain samudaay ko alpsankhyak kaa darja diye jane ke bare main joshi ne kaha ki samaaj ko baantne vaali koi bhi cheez sangh ko sweekaarya nahin he
 Joshi said, Jainism cannot be separated from Hinduism
 jain sampradaay ko rivaajon or dharmik maton ke aadhaar par hindu dharm se alag kiya jaataa he, saanskrithik taur par nahin
 On live-in relationships and homosexuality, the Sangh official said that the Sangh is strongly against both of them
 unhone kaha, yah avadharana na keval bhartiya sabhyataa ke khilaaf he balki puri maanav jati ke liye khatarnaak he
 Accepting this system will end the feeling of mutual trust in the society
 isliye is samaaj virdohi vyavastha ko kisi aadhaar par sweekaar nahin kiya janaa chahie
 On the consent of the Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama on homosexual relationships, Joshi said that this is his personal opinion and everyone has the right to express his views

 loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan bhi mujffarnagar ke dange ko tool dene kaa kaam kiya, lekin ab upi kii janata inaki chaal samaj gai he
 At the same time, Congress leader Ashok Singh said that the Ayodhya case is in the court and the rhetoric on it is wrong, adding that Mulayam Singh Yadav has got the urge to move political ground in UP, so he is again raising the hindu-muslim issue
 
 jabaki jediu netaa kasee tyaagi ne kaha ki mulaayam ne us samay sahi kadam uthaaya tha, lekin ab jo upi main ho rahaa he wo behad kharaab he
 The attitude of the UP government on Muzaffarnagar and Dadri issue created a feeling of insecurity among the minorities
 sansad ke pichley dinon sampann monsoon satr main saansadon ke vetan main kai guna vruddhi karne sambandhi vidheyak paarit kiya gaya lekin yah behad ascharyajanak he ki desh ke vibhinn rajyon main aaj bhi vidhayakon ke liye koi ek samaan vetan vyavastha kaayam nahin kii ja saki he
 While the mlas of Gujarat get the highest salary of 21 thousand rupees per month in the country, a legislator in Kerala has to spend only 300 rupees
 piares lejislative research dwaara uplabdh karaae gaye aankadon ke anusaar, desh main gujarat ekmaatr aisa rajya he jahaan vidhayakon ko prati maah 21 hajaar rupaye vetan diya jaataa he
 Apart from this, they also get an allowance of Rs 200 per day for participating in the proceedings of the House during the Vidhan Sabha session
 lekin is suchi main kerala ke vidhayakon kii sthiti behad kamjor he jahaan unhen maatr teen sau rupaye ke masik vetan se kaam chalaanaa padataa he 
 They also get a daily allowance of only four hundred rupees
 iske baad himachal pradesh main vetan tathaa kuch anya bhatte milakar vidhayakon ko 20 hajaar rupaye, punjab main kareeb 12 hajaar rupaye, rajasthan main das hajaar rupaye, tamilnadu main kareeb das hajaar rupaye, haryana main kareeb aath hajaar rupaye or dilli main paanch hajaar rupaye se bhi kam vetan miltaa he
 PRS said that like salary, mlas get the same daily allowance, constituency allowance, office allowance, accommodation facility and travel facility as mps, but there is a huge difference in the state wise salary as well
 haryana rajya main vidhayakon ko masik vetan nahin miltaa lekin unhen pratidin ek hajaar rupaye ke hisaab se bhatta miltaa he jo kisi bhi rajya main vidhayakon ko milane vaala sarvaadhik bhatta he
 Senior experts in legal matters related to PRS said that there is no uniformity in salary of mlas across the country as each state has its own 'pay Payment Act' which sets rules regarding salary, allowances and pension etc
 of mlas
 isliye vetan kaa dhaancha or bhatton sambandhi niyam rajyon main alag alag hai
 Apart from this, while increasing the salary of mlas, the state legislatures also take into consideration the possible criticism from the public
 yahi vajah he ki nijee kshetra main jahaan har varsh vetan main baari vruddhi hoti he, vidhayakon kaa vetan chaar paanch saal main ek baar badhata he
 Amidst the social media hype and the already overcrowded crowd in public transport, the Kejriwal government of Delhi has finally put the entire plan of its odd-even formula in front of the public
 sawaal plan par bhi uth rahe hai or sawaal sarkaar ke achaanak se jage police par us bharose ko lekar bhi, jise vah pehle apana ang maanati hi nahin thi
 Because the entire force of this war against air pollution is on the Delhi Police
 lekin in sab ke bich bada sawaal yah bhi he ki kya vaaki sabakuch bura hi he yaa isamen ek shubh shuruyaat ke sanket bhi hai
 It is true and also coincidental that from which the Aam Aadmi Party government imported the odd-even formula, a red alert has been issued recently when the pollution level goes up to 200 points
 skool-collejon ko band rakhane ke nirdesh die gaye to vaahanon kii awajahi par bhi lagaam kasi gai
 In contrast, the pollution level in Delhi has crossed 400 points and the government has now taken care of the common man
 haalanki, tamaam kamiyon or charchaaon se itar ek paksh yah bhi he ki der se hi sahi sarkaar ne us aam aadmi kii sud lee he jiske prati vaazib taur par vah jimmedaar he
 
 
 
 to kya sab kuch itnaa bura he?ek aankade ke mutabik, rashtriya rajdhani main jin privet gadiyon par sarkaar nayaa niyam lagu karne ja rahi he, unki sankhya 84,75,371 he
 That is, from January 1, 2016, only 42,37,685 of these trains will be authorized to take to the streets and fill fronts for 12 hours from Monday to Saturday, when the rule comes into force
 jaahir taur par isseamjan ko pareshanihogi, lekin der-saver ek acchhee shuruyaat hi safal nattejey tak pahunchati he isamen bhi koi doraay nahin he
 Public participation becomes most important for this form of government to fit on the roads
 yani bataur dilliwasi hamen-aapako un upayon kii talash kerani hogi jo hamaare liye phydemand hone ke saath hi paryaavaran ke liye laabhakaari or niyamon ke anukool hon
 1) Cool solution is instead of getting stuck in the discussion of whether we are standing with the government on the issue of car pooling-odd, if the environment like Delhi's 'gas chamber' changes, then every citizen living here should get the benefit
 Going to do
 aise main hafte main teen din apni gaadi par nahin chadhane ko lekar vishaad karne se behatar he ki is ore vikalp ke taur par car pooling kaa sahaara liya jaae
 Car pooling simply means the option of riding in the car of a co-passenger on the same route
 yani agar aapke kisi mitra ke paas sam sankhya or aapke pasvisham sankhya kii gadihai to aap donon hafte main teen-teen din ek duusare ke saath safar kar sakate hai
 It would be better if you expand your range and also connect other colleagues or friends with this option
 isse aapas main dosti badhegi, chaar log saath safar karenge to manzil kii duuri kaa ahsaas kam hoga
 There will be a decrease in the cost of traffic and there will not be a shortage of vehicles on the roads
 2) public transport kii ore rukh karendilli main beshak public transport kii apni kamiyaan hai
 Metro congestion from DTC buses to metro is not hidden from anyone, but as an immediate measure, the Kejriwal government has also allowed the use of school buses
 isse bacchon ko skool laane or vaapis ghar chhodane ke baad khadey vaahanon kaa sadupyog hoga
 This model has been successful in Canada
 yanibheed se aanshik rup sehi sahi raahat milegi
 Apart from this, Transport Minister Gopal Rai has announced that the Delhi government will take 7000 more buses on the roads in different installments by 2017
 bas or metro kii sawari jahaan aapaki jeb ke anukool he, vahiin kai maukon par yah aapako apni gaadi se jaldi gantavy tak pahunchaati bhi he
 Apart from this, the facility of traveling from daily pass to monthly pass and annual pass in DTC buses can also become an option to travel at a cheaper rate
 metro card banavaane par bhi aapako roj ke kiraye main 10 fisadi kii chhot milti he
 3) Pooling in cabs and autos, the government is now bringing this rule only for private vehicles
 yani offis jane ke liye taxi or auto kaa bhi vikalp khulaa he
 Many cab and auto service companies are preparing to launch new and cheaper plans for this
 iske alaava cab pooling bhi sasti daron par uplabdh he
 4) Cycling for short distances: Bicycle rides for short distances are everywhere from big cities of big countries to big cities of small countries
 yah na sirf bajet or parking kii samasya main feet baithti he, balki sehat ke liye bhi laabhprad he
 Keeping in mind the environment of many countries, a cycle ride is also organized for a day
 aise main kitna acha ho agar kam duuri ke safar ke liye cycle kii sawari kaa anand liya jaae
 a bicycle ride three days a week can relieve you of the fit and gym expenses
 5) samay kii hogi bachatsadakon par kam gadiyon ke hone se ab dilli vaasiyon ko trephic jam kii samasya se bhi nijaat milane kii sambhaavna he
 That is, now it will take less time to reach your destination than before
 sidhe shabdon main kahen to rojaanaa offis jane-aane main aapkaa bahumoolya samay bachegaa, jise aap doston or parivaar waalon ke saath bitaa sakate hai
 6) Responsibility towards environment: With all these measures, Delhiites can fit in the equidistant formula in the coming time, while discharging some inconvenience and discharge their responsibility towards the environment
 yah na sirf aapako balki aapke parivaar ko behatar kal or acchhee sehat kii guarantee detaa he
 The five-week-old crisis that rocked Indian tennis was partially resolved on Saturday, when rebel players made themselves available for the Davis Cup tie against Indonesia
 isse pehle shuukravaar ko akhil bhartiya tennis sangh (eitie) ne davis cap main khilne ke halaat se sambandhit aashwaasan khilaadiyon ko likhit main die the

 This is a major step towards resolving the crisis but it will still take some time for the players and AITA to reach a prior consensus
 khilaadiyon ne eitie ko likhe patr main kaha ki ham indonesia mukaable ke liye apni uplabdhta kii pushti karnaa chaahate hai jo is baat par nirbhar karata he ki eitie patr main likhe sabhi vaadon ko bina shart puraa kare
 Some of the issues raised by the players have not been resolved yet, so our availability is confirmed only by Indonesia

 '' hindi ko rajbhasha kaa darja 14 sitambar, 1949 ke din mila tha
 Since then, this day is celebrated as 'hindi Day' every year
 lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki hindi diwas kyon manaaya jaataa he? iske peeche ek vajah he
 Let's know the important things related to this
 - hindi bhartiya ganraaj kii rajkeey or madhya bhartiya- arya bhashaa he
 According to the 2001 census, about 25
 79 karod bhartiya hindi kaa upyog maatrubhaasha ke rup main karte hai, jabaki lagbhag 42
 200 million people use one of its more than 50 dialects
 - 1998 ke purv, maatrubhaashiyon kii sankhya kii drushti se vishwa main sarvaadhik boli jane vaali bhashaaon ke jo aankade milte the, unamem hindi ko teesraa sthaan diya jaataa tha
 Major dialects of Hindi include Awadhi, Bhojpuri, Brajbhasha, Chhattisgarhi, Garhwali, Haryanvi, Kumauni, Magadhi and Marwari languages
 kaise hindi baniin rajbhashasaal 1947 main jab angreji hukumat se bharat aaazaad hua to uske saamne bhashaa ko lekar sabase bada sawaal tha
 Because hundreds of languages and dialects are spoken in India
 6 disambar 1946 main aaazaad bharat kaa samvidhan taiyaar karne ke liye samvidhan kaa gathan hua
 The Constituent Assembly approved its final draft of the Constitution on 26 November 1949
 aaazaad bharat kaa apana samvidhan 26 janvari 1950 se puure desh main lagu hua
 But the issue of which national language of India will be chosen was very important
 kaaphi soch vichaar ke baad hindi or angreji ko nae raashtra kii bhashaa chunaa gaya
 The Constituent Assembly accepted Hindi written in Devanagari script as the official language of the nation along with the British
 14 sitambar 1949 ko samvidhan sabha ne ek mat se nirnay liya ki hindi hi bharat kii rajbhasha hogi
 The country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru said that seeing the importance of this day, Hindi Day should be celebrated on September 14 every year
 bataaden pehla hindi diwas 14 sitambar 1953 main manaaya gaya tha
 On 14 September 1949, the Constituent Assembly decided with a view that Hindi will be the official language of India

 The Geeta press controversy which has been going on since last month has now come to a halt at a critical point
 vetan badhaane ko lekar chal rahi karmchaariyon kii hadtaal or das round baatcheet ke vifal ho jane ke baad press kaa kaam thapp padaa hua he
 But now the trustees of Geeta Press have closed a Geeta Press in Negorakhpur by suggesting that it should be moved to some other place
 philhal sabaki nazren shuukravaar ko hone vaali gyarahawein daur kii baatcheet par tiki hai
 There is no consequence of the conversation
 The identity of the famous Geeta Press, which has been supplying religious books related to Hinduism around the world, and its old place may now be changed forever
 kam se kam aaj ke halaat or ise chalaane valetrustiyon kii baat par yakeen kiyajae to aisa hi lagata he
 In fact, the press has been closed due to the strike that has been going on for almost a month and so far no dialogue has come out between the employees and the trustees
 vetan ko lekar shuru hua tha vivadahadtaal kii shuruyaat tovethan badhaane kii maang se hui thimgar isi ko lekar jab jhagada badha or workaron ne kathith taur par ek suparvizer kii pitayee kar di to maamle ne or tool pakad liya
 The Trust suspended 17 employees, including 12 permanent and 5 temporary employees, considering it indiscipline
 baad main baatcheet hone par gita press trust sthai karmchaariyon ko to waapas lene par raji ho gai
 But the temporary workers were fired
 karmchaaree apni maang par adebus baat yaheen atak gai or iske baad se das daur kii baatcheet ke baavjood na to trust unhen waapas lene ko taiyaar hui or na hi karmchaariyon ne un paanch asthai logon kii vaapasi kii shart or jid chodi
 Fed up, the people of the trust are now considering shifting the entire press to another place
 trustee ishwar prasad patawaari ne bataaya ki agar ye samasya lambe samay tak chali to pehle to bazaar se pustaken chhapavai jaaengi
 If we drag more time on that too, we will have to consider and shift somewhere
 shift karne kaa vikalpatark majaburi kaa he magar gita press ko kahin or shift karne ke suzav bhar se hangaamaa much gaya he
 People say that Geeta Press is the identity of Gorakhpur and by separating it from the city, the identity of this institution will be lost forever
 gita press ke sansthaapak ghanashyam das ji jalaan kaa parivaar ise lekar sakate main he
 The family, which has been associated with the Gita Press Trust for three generations, may be out of the trust now, but they say that a lot can be done to maintain the press in Gorakhpur and solve the problems related to the salaries of the employees
 bas shart ye he ki trustee or karmchaaree bich kaa rasta nikaalane ke liye taiyaar hon
 Salary discrepancy: The staff argue that permanent workers are left with minimum wages and temporary workers are left to the contractor's mercy as per government standards? And after all, why the figures of profit and loss are not made public in this trust worldwide? The family of Ghanshyam Das Jalan, who laid the foundation of the Gita Press, raises a finger on the trustees
 gyarahawein daur kii baatcheet par nigatiob maamla ek baar phir gyarahawein daur kii baatcheet par aakar tikaa he
 Where mediation between employees and trustees is being done by the officers of Labor Department and Administration
 trust se jude logon kaa sabar ab dhire-dhire jawaab detaa ja rahaa he lihaaja bahut mumkin he ki agar baat shuukravaar ko hui baithak main bhi nahin bani to trust gita press ko kahin or le jane ke apane faisle kaa aupchaarik elaan kar de
 However, whatever the result, the readers of the Gita and other religious books are deeply hurt by this arrogance about the Gita Press, which is spreading the message worldwide
 dabi jubaan main kuch log to ye bhi kehete hai ki jo sandesh yahaan se duniya bhar main jaataa he agar gita press chalaane vaale use gambhirtha se lete to shaayad ye naubat kabhi nahin aati

 Will Yogguru Ramdev's fast continue from August 9? Is Baba Ramdev going to start a big revolution on Monday? Is Baba Ramdev preparing to go to jail? Baba Ramdev had announced to answer these questions on Monday itself
 yogaguru baba ramdev ne dilli ke ramlila maidan main 9 agast ko hi kai muddon ke khilaaf apane ran kaa elaan kiya tha
 It was also said that his symbolic fast will last for three days and if the government does not pay attention to their demands, then the next big announcement will be on the evening of 11th

 23 maheene ke ek bachche ke mata-pita ko har vakt is baat kii chintaa sataati rahati he ki kahin unka baccha khud ko hi naa kha le
 Here we are talking about a UK child who has an unusual genetic disease
 is beemaari ke chalate bachche ko har vakt bhukh lagi rahati he
 Geiger Buckston is one of the few children in the UK with prader-willi syndrome (PWS)
 is vajah se vah apane haath aane vaali har cheez ko khaanaa chahta he or use is baat kaa ehsaas nahin hota ki uskaa pet bhar gaya he
 Children of PWS often eat forcefully and have a craze for food
 kabhi naa mitane vaali bhukh ke alaava in bacchon kaa shaareerik or bhavatmak vikaas bhi bahut dhire-dhire hota he
 Also, they have difficulty in learning anything
 aapako bataa den ki britain main har saal 15,000 main se ek baccha is beemaari se prabhavit hota he
 When Geiger was three weeks old, doctors were upset that he did not respond
 baad main jaanch hui to pataa chalaa ki vah PWS se prabhavit he
 Although he is already well now, he has not spoken a single word yet and has recently started walking on his knees
 gijar ke gharavaale hameshaa uske bhavishya ko lekar pareshaan rahete hai kyonki wo kabhi aatmanirbhar nahin ho paaegaa
 Geiger's mother said, 'we have to keep an eye on Geyser all the time
 ham use akelaa chhodane ke bare main soch bhi nahin sakate
 'he said,' He starts eating anything and we have to monitor him so that he does not gain weight
 ham use akelaa nahin chhod sakate kyonki wo kabhi itnaa zyada kha letaa he ki uskaa pet fatne ko aa jaataa he
 He can also eat himself one day
 'haalanki gijar kii maa kaaphi sakaaratmak hai or unhen ummid he ki unka betaa ek din swasth or khushhaal jivan jarur ji paaegaa
 On the other hand, the families of other children affected by PWS told how much their children eat due to this disease
 saal 2011 main do saal kii ek bacchee shaadi ke resepshan main parose jane vaala teen manjila kek akele hi kha gai
 At the same time, in June 2012, a child had almost embraced death by eating himself
 pichley saal paanch saal ke ek bachche ne khidki kaa pardaa or diwaar kaa plaster kha liya tha
 It is common to be stressed if the exam is on the head
 aise main agar aap bhi pariksha kaa tanaav le rahe hai to yah aapaki taiyaariyon par baari pad saktaa he
 Indeed, experts believe this and many studies have also proved that stress causes a person's memory to become weak and this affects his ability to think and make decisions

 '- input IANS Samajwadi Party (SP) Rajya Sabha MP and former Prime Minister Chandrashekhar's son Neeraj Shekhar has resigned from Rajya Sabha membership today (monday)
 beete kuch samay se akhilesh yadav or niraj shekhar ke bich tanaav chal rahaa tha
 In fact, in the Lok Sabha elections, he was seeking tickets from his family's traditional seat Ballia, but the Samajwadi Party did not give the ticket, after which he was running angry
 sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki niraj shekhar kal (mangalvaar) dopaher 12:30 baje bhartiya janata party (bijepi) main shaamil ho sakate hai
 It is being said that in 2020, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) may send him to the Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh
 haalanki unhone kaha ki vyaktigat kaarnon se istipha diya he, bataaya ja rahaa he ki rajyasabha adhyaksh ne niraj shekhar ke istipha ko sweekaar bhi kar liya he
 The by-election was held after the death of Chandrashekhar, an eight-time MP from Ballia, in which his son Neeraj Shekhar won
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhi niraj ko jeet mili lekin 2014 ke chunaav main niraj haar gaye the
 At the same time, in the Lok Sabha elections of 2019, the Samajwadi Party did not field him from Ballia

 The expensive fees of private hospitals are not suitable for their financial health
 bharat samet duniya kii aadhi aabaadi naresh kii tarah swasthya sevaaon se maharoom hai
 When Naresh came to know about the introduction of the world's largest health insurance scheme in India, it was as if his hopes got vitamins

 The expensive treatment of one member forces the whole family to struggle
 aazaadee ke baad jila aspataal, saamudayik centre or nijee aspataalon kii sankhya desh kii jansankhya ke anupaat main nahin badi
 Hospitals could not double as much as the population had multiplied by seven times
 ek anumaan ke mutabik, desh main chote bade milakar kareeb 60,000 se 70,000 aspataal hai, jinamein 60 fisadi aise hai jinamein 30 yaa usase kam bed hai
 There are only 3,000 hospitals in which the number of beds is 100 or more
 desh main kul 470 medical college hai, jinamein 230 sarkari or 240 nijee hai
 Roughly 20 lakh beds will be available in the entire country i
e
 just one bed for 625 citizens in a country with a population of 125 crores
 ayushmanbharat kaarykram ke jariye sarkaar kaa prayaas desh ke 10 karod pariwaron ko behatar swasthya sevaayen uplabdh karaane kaa he
 It was prepared after the experience of various health schemes being run at the central and state level
 daawa he ki yah kaarykram desh kii 50 karod aabaadi ko muft sehat beemaa degaa
 The amount of insurance is Rs 5 lakh
 hogi
 That is, five lakh rupees on treatment
 tak kaa kharch sarkaar uthaaegi
 1 across the country under the scheme
 5 lakh health and welnes centre banenge jo chot-chapet, khaansee-zukam kaa ilaaj karenge yani ki praathmik upachaar
 Under the Ayushman Bharat Insurance Scheme, 1,350 minor and minor diseases will be treated
 marij ke bharti hone se teen din pehle se lekar aspataal se chuttee ke baad 15 din tak kaa kharchaa (dawaaen, maraham pattee) beemaa yojana main shaamil hoga
 The benefit of the insurance scheme will be available only for those diseases in which hospitalization will be necessary
 iskaa kharch centre or rajya, donon milakar uthaaenge
 NITI Aayog member and Dr
 Ayushman Bharat who played a key role in designing the program
 vinod paul kehete hai ki ayushmaan duniya kaa sabase bada swasthya mishan hoga
 About 20 percent of the country's population is below the poverty line
 ayushmaan kaa laabh samaaj ke nichali paaydaan par khadi 40 fisadi aabaadi ko milegaa
 In such a situation, it will benefit the people coming from below poverty line as well as Nikwon middle class
 isko taiyaar karne main sweden, germany, canada, america, thailand, japan, korea, china aadi deshon main lagu nitiyon kaa adhyayan kiya gaya
 Dr
 paul thailand kii nitiyon se kaaphi prabhavit dikhe, jahaan universal kawarej health card rakhane vaale sabhi nagarikon kaa muft ilaaj hota he
 Also, the government has a big focus on primary health
 dow
 Says Paul, "the government's emphasis will be on providing a large number of insurance as well as developing infrastructure
 deshbhar main taiyaar kiye jane vaale health and welnes centre usee kaa hissaa hai
 The government is constantly making efforts to fill the shortage of hospitals, doctors, nurses, para medical staff etc
 ''beemaa kii ulajhankoi andeh nahin ki bharat ko swasth banane kii disha main yah bada kadam he
 But insurance written on paper is no less complicated than a disease
 jatilta isliye kyonki iske kriyanvayan ke kai paksh hai
 For example, beneficiaries, insurance companies, private hospitals, doctors, etc
 50 karod logon ko beemaa muhaiyaa karaane ke liye sarkaar ke saamne badi chunauti laagat ko kam rakhane kii hogi
 Increasing the cost will increase the premium of insurance companies, which will indirectly affect the government
 desh main swasthya dhaancha oont ke munh main jira ke samaan he
 This shortage in the face of demand makes health services expensive
 nijee kshetra main ilaaj kii daron ke koi tay maanak bhi nahin hai or sarkari aspataal achche hote to beemaa kii jarurat kyon padati
 a large population will be given contracts under insurance scheme for insurance companies according to the states
 har rajya ke liye boli lagaai jaaegi, jisamen nijee or sarkari, donon beemaa companiyaan hissaa le sakati hai
 The premium will be fixed based on the number of people eligible for the scheme in the state's population
 beemaa company bajaj alinge main health adeministration team ke pramukh bhaskar nerurkar kehete hai, "sarkaar kii ore se ayushmaan bharat jaisi pahal kaaphi sakaaratmak he
 The company has had a good experience with such schemes being run in different states
 ''gujarat, mizoram or uttarakhand jaise rajya iskaa acha udhaaharan hai
 Ayushmann will participate prominently in the auction process
 nerurkar kehete hai ki aise bimaadharak jo is skim ke antargat nahin aate hai unke premium par iskaa koi asar nahin padegaa
 Kapil Mehta, founder and CEO of Secure Now Insurance Broker, says the insurance sector is expected to grow significantly due to Ayushman Bharat
 "lekin maujuuda buniyadi dhaanche par itane logon kaa ilaaj hona badi chunauti he
 The pressure of patients on government hospitals is high
 aise main nijee sansthaanon ko bad-chadhakar hissaa lenaa hoga
 There is a great need for the government to work on infrastructure by increasing the budget on health
 '' labhaarthiyon ko is skim kaa laabh tabhi mil saktaa he jab praathmik upachaar centre majboot hon or sarkaar sabhi pakshon kii bhagidaari sunishchit kar sake
 Challenges of the Central Government: Ayushman Bharat Scheme cannot be implemented without taking states across the country
 yojana par hone vaale kharch main rajya bhi bhagidaar hai
 The Center will bear 60 per cent of the expenditure in Ayushman, while 40 per cent will be shared by the states
 jabaki uttar purvi or pahari rajyon masalan, jammu-kashmir, himachal or uttakhand jaise rajyon main centre kii hissedari 90 fisadi kii hogi
 The credit of Ayushman will come to the center, so the government will also face the challenge of joining the states
 kendriya swasthya or parivaar kalyaan mantri jagat prakaash nadda kehete hai, "24 rajyon ke saath emoyu sin kiye ja chuke hai
 Talks are on with the states
 hamen puraa bharosa he ki sabhi rajyon ko beemaa yojana ke saath jod liya jayega
 He also said that this is a very big scheme
 iske kriyanvayan main takanic kaa puraa istemaal kiya jayega
 An IT solution is being prepared for this, which will be ready by the end of next month
 ve kehete hai ki ayushmaan samet kisi bhi swasthya yojana ke liye bajet kii koi bhi dikkat nahin he
 As the states implement the scheme, the budget required will be provided
 sarkaar kaa puraa focus behatar swasthya suvidhaayen uplabdh karaane par he
 The biggest challenge in the way of Ayushman is that without private hospitals, private hospitals do not agree on the rates fixed by the government for the treatment of various diseases
 association of healthcare prowider ke mahanideshak dow
 Girdhar J
 gyani kehete hai, "sarkaar ko mugalata he ki in daron par ilaaj sambhav he
 The government has estimated these rates at which private hospitals are not ready to treat them
 sarkaar kah rahi he ki ek saal aap in daron par ilaaj kar lijie, ek saal baad is par adhyan kar inako sanshodhit kar diya jayega
 Gyan also says that there is a big difference in the availability and demand of doctors, nurses and para medical staff to treat such a large population
 indian medical association ke finance secretary dow
 Vinod Kumar Munga says that the government's intention behind this scheme is good, but its implementation is the biggest challenge
 ve kehete hai ki sarkaar kii skim vaastaviktaa se dur he
 Commenting on the treatment rates, he says that the government has fixed Rs 9,000 for Caesarean delivery
 isamen hospitaliseshan, oparation theatre kaa kharch, sarjan, anaesthesia sab kuch kaise sambhav hoga?ve kehete hai sarkaar kii ore se di gai daren bahut kam hai
 The government should fix treatment rates in a technical way, otherwise this scheme too will die like other insurance schemes of the government
 lekin dow
 Paul says that this will not happen at all because the cost is thoughtfully prepared
 "ise sijiechaes kii daren, export group, 60 se 70 aspataalon se baatcheet or laagat par kiye gaye adhyan ke aadhaar par taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Therefore, private hospitals should go ahead with these rates for at least one year
 ''yah he health kaa nijeekarnoxfam india kii health program ko-audinator shamila khalil kahati hai ki desh ke nagarikon ko muft or behatar swasthya suvidhaayen dena sarkaar kii jimmedaari he
 But giving insurance to large population will increase private sector participation which will create imbalance in the existing health infrastructure
 ve kahati hai ki praathmik upachaar kendron ko durust na karne par marij un bimariyon ke liye bhi bade nijee or sarkari aspataalon par nirbhar ho jaaenge, jinka ilaaj nichle str par hi sambhav tha
 Governmentwide 1
 5 lakh health and welnes centre kholane kaa lakshya rakhaa he lekin iske liye 1,200 karod ru
 The budget is extremely low
 saath hi neshnal rural health mishan (enarechaem) ke tahat buniyadi dhaanche ke dekhbhaal ke bajet ko bhi sarkaar ne nahin badhaayaa
 In such a situation, there is no hope of improvement in the condition of public health center, community center and health sub center for first aid
 shamila kahati hai ki beemaa yojana dene ke baad nijee kshetra kii bhagidaari badaae se swasthya sevaayen mahangi ho sakati hai
 This will certainly also cause the premium to increase, which will have an impact on the government
 iske alaava 50 karod logon ko beemaa suvidha muhaiyaa karaane ke liye bhi 2,000 karod rupye kaa aavantit bajet aparyaapt he
 It is likely that the scheme will come into force on 15 August
 lekin is baat kii guarantee nahin ki skim kii lonching ke saath hi labhaarthiyon ke haath kuch aayega
 It is expected that the scheme to provide free insurance to 10 crore poor families will be Ayushman (long life)

 Excerpts from Associate Editor Shubham Shankhadhar's conversation with CEO Indu Bhushan about Ayushman Bharat Yojana: Health services infrastructure to be increased for Ayushman Bharat How long will the public benefit from Ayushman Bharat scheme? Work on Ayushman Bharat scheme is going on
 24 rajyon ke saath emoyu sin kiye ja chuke hai
 Our preparations will be completed by 15 August
 yah pradhanmantri ji par nirbhar karata he ki ve is skim ko kab launch karte hai
 With the launching, the work of marking the beneficiaries and making their cards will be started in the states
 labhaarthiyon ko kaise chinhit karenge?sahi labhaarthiyon kii pahchaan badi chunauti he
 Many beneficiaries of the same name, differences in name spelling, there are many things that create difficulty in identifying the right person
 haalanki rajyon ke madhyam se ek suchi gram panchayaton tak pahunchaa di gai he
 In order to let people know whether they are beneficiaries or not, the government will resort to technology and will campaign after the launch of the scheme
 labhaarthi kii sahi pahchaan ke liye sarkaar ek software bhi taiyaar kar rahi he, jo agle maheene tak banakar taiyaar ho jayega
 What is the role of the Health and Wellness Center in this? The success of the National Health Protection Scheme rests on the Health and Wellness Center
 in centres ko vyapak swasthya suvidhaayen dene ke liye sakasham banaaya jayega
 Along with first aid, these centers will play an important role before the hospitalization of the patient and also after discharge
 ye centre jitne majboot honge aspataalon par boj utana hi kam hoga
 Along with first aid, these centers will also have facilities like telemedicine and yoga
 infrastracchar kii kami se kaise niptenge?nishchit taur par maang ke mukaable desh main swasthya infrastracchar kam he
 Right now we are spending 1% of GDP on health services, which is increased to 2
 5 fisadi tak le jane kaa lakshya he
 The Ayushman Bharat Scheme will generate huge demand in the country which will encourage private hospitals to expand
 saath hi sarkari aspataalon ke paas bhi buniyadi dhaanchon ko khadaa karne kaa avasar hoga kyonki beemaa company se mila paisa unheen ke paas rahegaa
 How will the scheme merge in the schemes of the states? The insurance schemes and other conditions in the state schemes will be tailored to Ayushman
 saath hi kisi rajya kaa marij agar kisi anya rajya main ilaaj karaane jaataa he to uskaa bhugtan rajya sarkaar ko karnaa hoga
 National health portability will help in this direction
 ayushmaan bharat ek bahut bada project he
 It will definitely take time to complete, but it is certain that we are going in the right direction
 *** a video has been going viral on social media for a few days, through which an attempt is being made to prove how Manmohan Singh had to obey Sonia Gandhi's orders even when he was Prime Minister
 video main ek aalishaan haul main purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh or sonia gandhi srilanka ke pradhanmantri ranil vikramsinghe ke saath ek aupchaarik bhent karte hue dikhaai de rahe hai
 In the beginning of the video, an attempt is being made to show that Ranil Wickremesinghe gestures to Manmohan to sit in his armchair after introducing Sonia and Manmohan to his colleagues
 lekin usee samay sonia, manmohan singh ko saamne vaali kursi par baithne kaa ishaara karti hai or khud vikramsinghe kii bagal vaali kursi par baith jaati hai
 People are trying to show on the social media on the pretext of this video that despite being PM, Singh did not get respect like King
 viral videomen dikh rahe logon se pataa chalata he ki ye video ''NNIS - News'' naam ke ek utyub channel se liya gaya he
 This channel uploaded this video on 26 April 2017
 kya ye video 26 april 2017 kaa hi he ye jaanane ke liye ham videsh mantralay kii website par gaye
 It was learned that Ranil Wickramasinghe had indeed visited India for four days from 25 to 29 April 2017
 website par srilanka ke pradhanmantri ke saath videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj kii kuch tasviren bhi maujuud hai
 a closer look reveals that in these pictures, Wickremesinghe is in the exact same suit and tie as seen in the viral video
 yani sonia gandhi se vikramsinghe kii ye mulaakaat usee din kii he, jis din sushamaa swaraj unase milin thi
 These pictures are of the same hall of Hyderabad House in Delhi as seen in the video
 26 april 2017 ko news agency ANI ne bhi sonia or vikramsinghe kii is mulaakaat kii kuch tasviren twitor par aplod kii thi
 Everyone knows that Manmohan Singh was not the Prime Minister at the time of this meeting in 2017
 is baithak main wo sonia gandhi ke saath congress netaa or purv pradhanmantri ke taur par gaye the
 Sonia Gandhi was sitting on the chair next to Wickremesinghe as the chairperson of the UPA
 aisi aupchaarik baithkon main sabaki baithne kii jagah pehle se tay hoti he, isliye kisi kaa kisi ko hataa kar baithne kaa sawaal nahin hota
 That is, the viral video is real but what is being told about it is completely wrong
 oreisha ke vibhinn hisson main logon ne is afvaah ke baad afra-tafari main namak khareednaa shuru kar diya ki yah bhi aalu kii tarah bazaar se gaayab ho jayega
 With this, the price of salt rose to Rs 60 per kg
 vigat kai dinon se aalu kii badi keemton se pareshaan log kiraane kii dukaan par adhik se adhik maatra main namak kharidne ke liye jutane lage
 This caused panic in the districts of Jajpur, Nayagarh and Khurda along with the capital Bhubaneswar

 Going on the arguments of the people, they say that because the men of the house earn, they work outside, therefore women should do the housework only

 usne poochtacha ke dauraan police ke saamne kai khulaase kiye hai
 Police have come to know that he had bought an expensive Mercedes car using fake checks
 iske baad usne ek honda city car bhi kharidi thi
 From childhood, youth were expensive hobbies

 During the investigation, Raipur Police has found 70 checks in Bhopal Fadrell Bank and 30 in Central Bank of India, on which Udayan had forged signatures
 taaki wo marsdes car kharid sake
 By fake signatures, he had withdrawn money from his parents' account and bought an expensive Mercedes car and later bought a Honda City car
 kaaphi dinon tak marsdes car kaa upyog nahin hua to, usamen kuch kharabi aa gai thi
 Raipur police is repairing that car
 taaki use raipur laayaa ja sake
 However, Udayan had also given a good amount of money to bank employees to withdraw money from the parents' account

 "obama said," The main discussion against it at the time was that Iran would not abide by the deal
 vah dhokhaa degaa
 We now have evidence that in one year it has complied with the agreement
 yah keval meri raay nahin he
 This is not the opinion of the people of my administration only

 '' obama ne paris jalwaayu samjhaute ke bare main kaha ki is antarrashtriya samjhaute ko radd karne kii sambhaavna par bahut baatcheet hui he

 Let's work together
 sabase bada khatra yah he ki jab jalwaayu parivartan evam pradooshan kii baat aati he to yah hamaari vajah se nahin hone vaala kyonki hamaari jansankhya maatr 30 karod he
 This will be from China and India where the population is more than one billion

 He said that the Iranian nuclear deal is a good example of the "difference" between some rhetoric in the city, which is not new to the newly elected president, and reality

 This is the opinion of the Israeli military and intelligence officials who are part of a government strongly opposed to the deal
 ’’ Obama said of the Paris Climate Agreement that there has been a lot of talk on the possibility of canceling this international agreement
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ab aapke paas 200 desh hai jinhone is samjhaute par hastakshar kiye hai or acha samachar yah he ki ham pichley paanch, chah, aath varshon main yah dikhaane main safal rahe hai ki carbon utsarjan kam karne ke saath arthvyavastha kaa vastav main teji se vikaas karnaa sambhav he
 "the Paris Agreement tells the potentially polluting China and India and other countries to come together
" aaie milakar kaam karen
 The biggest danger is that when it comes to climate change and pollution, it is not going to happen because of us because our population is only 30 crores

 bataa den ki vishesh sibiai adaalat ne aarushi or hemraj kii hatya ke maamle main talwaar danpati ko 26 november, 2013 ko aaajeevan karawas kii sajaa sunai thi
 The court said that according to the circumstances and the evidence recorded in the record, the Talwar couple cannot be held guilty
 is tarah se usne talwaar danpati ko sibiai adaalat dwaara sunai gai aaajeevan karawas kii sajaa ko radd kar diya
 Talwar case - The decision came, but the question is still accepted, the court accepted the plea of the rest of the couple that neither the circumstances nor the evidence recorded in the record proved the involvement of Talwar couple in the murder of Aarushi and Hemraj
 Is happening adaalat ne kaha ki paristhitijanya sakshya ke abhaav main yah ek aisa durust maamla he jahaan apilkarta ko andeh kaa laabh diya ja saktaa he
 The court thus nullified the November 26, 2013 judgment of the special CBI court giving the benefit of doubt to both the appellants

 The Talwar couple will be released from jail on Friday

 The martyrdom of an Indian Army captain and three soldiers in the Pakistani shelling on 4 February at Bheember Gali in Rajouri sector has once again brought attention to the deteriorating situation along the Line of Control
 sangharsh viraam ulanghan pichley kuch varshon main teji badha he khaskar 2017 ke baad se
 The facts themselves tell the story
 2003 main sangharsh viraam lagu hone ke samay se lekar 2007 tak niyantran rekha par ulanghan kii 21 (sabhi 2007 main) or antarrashtriya seemaa (ibi) par teen ghatnaayen ho chuki thim
 Three army men were killed in them
 agle paanch varshon main yani 2008 se 2012 ke bich sangharsh viraam ulanghan kii ghatnaon main teji se vruddhi hui or unki sankhya 367 (elosi par 293 or ibi par 74) tak pahunch gai
 Four civilians (all in 2012) died in these incidents and 20 officers and soldiers of the security forces (army and BSF) were martyred
 uske baad ke paanch varshon yani 2013 se 2017 ke bich in ghatnaon main badhotaree hui or sankhya 2,764 (1,592 elosi, 1,172 ibi) tak pahunch gai
 Of these, 980 incidents (LOC 860, IB 120) occurred only in 2017
 in ghatnaon main 55 naagarik or 61 surakshakarmi (sena or biguef) maare gaye
 In just 36 days of 2018, there have been 241 incidents on the loc in which nine soldiers of the Indian security forces have to be martyred
 2017 ke baad or ab 2018 main jari sangharsh viraam ulalanghanon kii ghatnaon main badhotaree ke kya myne hai
 Since the surgical strike in September 2016, Pakistan has increased such antics
 bharat ne sochaa tha ki aisa karne se pakistan ko sabak milegaa or vah seemaa-paar ulalanghanon se baj aayega
 After giving a strong message from his side, it seems that India started exercising restraint, in the hope that Pakistan's attitude would change
 lekin pakistan ne is sanyam ko ek mauka samajhate hue uskaa phayda uthaa liya he
 After resuming the wounds inflicted by the surgical strike, he resumed his action, whether it was a cross-border intrusion or a ceasefire violation
 4 farvari ko hui ulanghan kii ghatana main pakistan kaa ek gharelu kaarak bhi tha
 The incident took place during Kashmir Solidarity Day
 pakistan pichley 28 varshon se 5 farvari ko kashmir soliderity de manaata aa rahaa he
 That day is a national holiday in Pakistan, which aims to convey the message that Pakistan will continue to give "moral, political and diplomatic" support to Kashmiris
 is din bhaashan die jate hai, juluus nikaale jate hai, maanav shrinkhlaayein banaai jaati hai, namaaj padhi jaati he, vagairah-vagairah
 Apart from this, India is fiercely whipped on this day and various provocative slogans are raised like "kashmir Banega Pakistan" "kashmir is the nerve of Pakistan's throat," "kashmir-pakistan is two hearts but one life
" ’’baharhaal pichley ek dashak main jo baat dhyaan dene vaali he vah yah he ki yah din utana ugr or joshila nahin dikhaai detaa he jaisaa vah 1990 ke dashak main dikhaai detaa tha
 According to Gallup's opinion poll quoted in the Pakistani media, since 1990 there has been a 19 percent increase in the number of people who believe Kashmir will never be free, and the number of people who have fallen by 14 percent It is believed that Kashmir will achieve independence in one or two years
 isaki vajah shaayad lambey samay se chali aa rahi ladaai se hone vaali thakaan yaa yah ehsaas he ki yah asambhav kaam he
 One proof of this fatigue is the statement by Pakistani Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa on Kashmir Solidarity Day, in which he said that the people of Kashmir are waiting for the international community's awareness of the UN referendum proposals
 navaj sharif ne is avasar kaa istemaal supreme court kii ore se unhen barkhaast kiye jane ke faisle par apni naaraazgi jaahir karne ke liye kiya
 Due to lack of enthusiasm on one hand and the constant elimination of terrorists from the Indian Army in Kashmir, the Pakistani Army is adopting other ways to keep the Kashmir issue alive
 pakistan elosi par tanaav badha rahaa he
 The situation on the loc has deteriorated and violence and counter-violence is increasing
 ab yah dekhnaa he ki kya yah sirf ulalanghanon tak hi simit rahegaa yaa yah aage visphotak sthiti bhi paidaa kar saktaa he

 The film 'sala Khadus' is produced by r Madhavan and Rajkumar Hirani and its director is Sudha Kongra
 film kii kahani he, mahila boxr madi or uske coach aadi ke rishton kii
 The politics around him and the feeling of jealousy playing in the house, which is evident by seeing the promos of the film, and my biggest fear after watching the promo was that the story of the film is not as much as the promos are
 Ho, we have already seen many films on boxing from above, so there was a question in mind that hardly we get to see anything new in this film
 par film ne mere saare dar dur kar die
 Let me tell you that in this film, r Madhavan plays a boxing coach and his protagonist is Ritika Singh, who is a boxer in real life
 saath hi film main inke saath hai, zakir, naser, mumtaz sarkaar or baljinder cor
 So first, let's talk about the shortcomings of the film
 sabase pehali khami, kaami he bhi or nahin bhi, darasal, is film ko aane main kaaphi time lag gaya or is bich 'lahore', 'mairi com' or 'bros' jaisi filmein aa gayi to ho saktaa he kuch log ise sirf boxing par kendrit film samajhakar cinema haul tak na jaaen, ho saktaa he darshak yah sochane lage ki vishay basi he
 The second thing is that the first part of the film lays the foundation of the story, what is happening on the screen is not new but still keeps you tied
 teesri kaami ho saktaa he, jo boxr he yaa jo is khel kii takanic se bhalee-bhaanti parichit hai, unhen kahin lage yah banxing film nahin he yaa kahin-kahin filmi ho gai
 The comments to ye thi kuch maamuli khamia or ab baat khoobiyon kii
 First thing, despite being a boxer, you get involved with this film and the film takes you on an emotional journey
 or jaisaa maine kaha, boxing film kaa centre jarur he par is ring main or bhi bahut kuch he boxing ke alaava
 No part of the film deviates from the tone and the film remains honest with its story and theme
 film ke kirdaaron ne damdaar abhinay kaa parichay diya
 R
 Madhavan does not even move 1 centimeter from his character, his hard work is clearly seen on his character
 behtareen abhinay kiya he, madhavan ne
 On the other hand, the novelty of Ritika proves to be a boon for the film's impudence and rawness
 puri urja or eemaandaaree ke saath ritika madi ke kirdaar main jaan daalane main safal rahati hai
 The film's script, screen-play, dialogues, background scores, cinematography all support the subject and make it a great product
 main yahaan abhinayta naser kii bhi tarif karnaa chaahunga, vah kamaal ke actor hai, role unka chota he par kirdaar ko kaise bada banaaya jaataa he, unase siikhnaa chahie
 At the same time, Zakir lives up to his expectations
 kul milakar 'saalaa khadoos ek acchhee film or ise yah sochakar na choden ki boxing par aap pehle bhi kai filmein dekh chuke hai
 3 to 'sala Khadus' from my side
 5 star
 But the film removed all my fears
 aapako bataa duun ki is film main aar madhavan boxing coach ke kirdaar main hai or unki shagird bani hai, ritika singh, jo real life main khud ek boxr hai
 Also in the film are Zakir, Nasser, Mumtaz Sarkar and Baljinder Kaur
 to sabase pehle baat karte hai, film kii khaamiyon kin
 First of all, there is a drawback or not, in fact, this film took a long time to arrive and in the meantime films like 'lahore', 'mary Kom' and 'brothers' have come, so some people may just box it
 Do not go to the cinema hall considering that the film is focused on, the audience may start thinking that the subject is stale
 duusari baat yah he ki film kaa pehla hissaa kahani kii neenv rakhata he, jo ho rahaa he screen par vah khaas nayaa to nahin par phir bhi aapako baandhe rakhata he
 The third drawback may be those who are boxers or who are well acquainted with the technique of the game, do not find it a boxing film or have it been filmed somewhere
 tippaniyan So this was some minor flaws and now it is about merits
 pehali baat aap boxr na hote hue bhi is film se judate hai or film aapako bhaavnaatmak safar par le jaati he
 And like i said, boxing is the center of the film, but there is more to this ring than boxing
 film kaa koi bhi hissaa sur se nahin bhatakta or yah film apni kahani or vishay ke prati eemaandaar rahati he
 The film's characters introduce strong acting
 aar madhavan apane kirdaar se 1 centimetre bhi hilte najar nahin aate, apane kirdaar par unki mehnat saaf najar aati he
 Madhavan has done a great job
 vahiin nai naveli ritika kaa bebaakapan or rones film ke liye vardaan sabit hoti he
 With full energy and honesty, Ritika succeeds in killing Madi
 film kii script, scrin-play, dialogs, becoground score, cinematographi sab vishay ko sahyog dekar use ek behtareen product banaate hai
 i would also like to praise actor Nasser here, he is an amazing actor, his role is small but how to make a character bigger, one should learn from them
 vahiin zakir apni ummid par khare utarate hai
 Overall 'sala Khadus' is a good film and don't leave it thinking that you have seen many films before on boxing
 meri taraf se 'saalaa khadoos' ko 3

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saath morishas ke pradhanmantri praveen jagannatha bhi is kaarykram main maujuud rahe
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his address here that apart from being a Prime Minister, i also welcome you as an MP of Kashi
 is dauraan unhone tumkur ke siddhaganga math ke swami ke nidhan par bhi shok vyakt kiya
 He said that this conference was started by Atal ji, but after his departure, this program is being welcomed for the first time
 PM bole ki baahar rahakar aap sabhi desh kii shakti ko duniya ko bataa rahe hai, aap log bharat ke brands ambesder hai
 The Prime Minister said that today there are prominent people from many countries of the world whose roots are in India
 unhone kaha ki pehle log kehete the ki bharat badal nahin saktaa, lekin hamane is soch ko hi badal diya he
 Today, India is leading the world in many respects
 is dauraan pradhanmantri ne apane kaarykaal kii unki sarkaar dwaara chalaai gai yojanaon ke bare main bataaya or sarkaar kii uplabdhiyaan ginaayin
 The PM said that a former Prime Minister of the country (rajiv Gandhi) had said that if the government sends one rupee, only 15 paise reaches the village
 jis party ne kai saal tak raaj kiya, usee party ke pradhanmantri bhi kuch nahin kar paae
 Our government used technology to end this loot
 ab ham sabsidi kaa sara hissaa sidhe bank acount ke jariye logon ko sidhe pahunchaate hai
 If we reached the old policy, about 4
 5 lakh karod se adhik kii sampatti kii lut ho jaati
 He said that the Congress had no intention of working in governments
 pradhanmantri bole ki main aapako ek or aankada detaa hum pichley saadhe chaar saal main hamaari sarkaar ne kareeb-kareeb 7 karod aise farji logon ko pahachaanakar, unhen vyavastha se hataaya he
 These 7 crore people were those who were never born, who were not really there
 unhone kaha ki ye 7 karod log sarkari suvidhaon kaa laabh le rahe the
 Think, more than the population of many countries in the whole of Britain, in France, in Italy, we had people who were living only on paper and taking advantage of government facilities on paper
 PM modi ne kaha ki mujhe sankoch tha ki ek taraf upi main kumbh chal rahaa he to varanasi main ye kaarykram karen yaa nahin karen
 But even then, the team of Yogi Adityanath has organized it
 unhone yahaan bani tent city kii bhi kaaphi tarif kii or kashivasiyon ke sahyog kii bhi daad di
 Modi made several announcements for overseas Indians, the Prime Minister also made some announcements for Indians living abroad
 PM ne kaha ki aapaki soshal security ke saath-saath passport, visa, PIO or OCI card ko lekar bhi tamaam prakriyaaon ko aasaan karne kaa prayaas sarkaar kar rahi he
 a new step has also been taken for nris a few months back
 unhone kaha ki duniyabar main hamaari Embassies or Consulates ko passport seva project se joda ja rahaa he, isse aap sabhi ke liye passport seva se judaa ek Centralized System taiyaar ho jayega
 Rather, going a step ahead, work is going on to release chip based e-passport as well
 pradhanmantri ne bataaya ki passport ke saath-saath visa se jude niyamon ko bhi saral kiya ja rahaa he
 By getting the facility of e-visa, your time is also being saved and troubles have also reduced
 abhi bhi agar koi samasyaayein isamen hai to uske sudhaar ke liye bhi kadam uthaae ja rahe hai
 PM said that in this changing India, you can play a big role in research and development and innovation
 sarkaar ye bhi koshish kar rahi he ki bharat ke Start-ups or NRI Mentors ko ek saath, ek plateform par laae
 Defense manufacturing can also be an important sector for you
 ab aap andaja lagaaie, agar desh puraane taur tareekon se hi chal rahaa hota, to aaj bhi is 5 lakh 78 hajaar karod rupye main se 4 lakh 91 hajaar karod rupye li ho rahaa hote
 If we had not changed the system, this amount would have been looted like it was before: PM @ narendramodi — PMO India (@pmoindia) January 22, 2019 The main theme of the 15th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas is New India
 pradhanmantri narendra modi yahaan kai deshon ke pratinidhiyon se milane ke alaava morishas ke pradhanmantri praveen jagannatha se bhi mulaakaat karenge
 This year's Pravasi Bharatiya Divas is also special in the sense that this time all the records of registration have been broken
 bataa den ki pravasi bhartiya diwas 21 janvari ko shuru hua or 23 janvari tak chalegaa
 Mauritius Prime Minister Pravin Jagannath announced that Bhojpuri festival will be organized in his country soon
 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj kaa sambodhansushamaa swaraj ne is kaarykram main kaha ki pravasi bhartiya diwas kii shuruyaat purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ne kii thi, 2004 se 2014 ke bich is diwas kaa mahatv ghatata chalata gaya or ek rasm banakar rah gaya
 But in May 2014, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi took power, this day brought new life
 hamaari sarkaar ne desh ke baahar based bhartiya samudaay ke logon se sidhaa samvaad kiya tha
 When the Prime Minister gave a speech in Madison Square, people used to ask if it would fill the hall, then i used to smile and see that day
 sushamaa ne is dauraan manch par baithe sabhi atithiyon ko swaagat kiya, haalanki is dauraan vah morishas ke pradhanmantri praveen jagannatha kaa swaagat karnaa bhul gayi
 Later Sushma came again and talked about him
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kaa sambodhanyogi adityanath ne yahaan kaha ki kumbh ke saath-saath pravasi bhartiya diwas kaa aayojan karnaa uttar pradesh ke liye saubhaahgya kii baat he

 i love IPL
 itani sari vajahen hai isaki
 Cricket is not one of these
 haa, haa mana ki is lig kii shuruyaat jentalmen khel cricket se hui
 But there is nothing Gentle left in it, nor anything Manly
 sari sharafat or khulaa khel farrukhaabadi vaali veerta tauliye main baandhakar bech di gai
 The IPL is actually a corporate tournament
 tamaam rais hai, jinhone paise ke dam par majamaa laga rakhaa he
 What to say about this game of ball and bat, he cannot save his back even in bowling
 vahaan laal hote rahe hai, isliye tay kiya ki yahaan cricket ke kuch ranbankuron, kuch laalon ko kharid lenge
 Then they will show their jauhar and we will cook in its heat and make money
 ye cricketer bhi aise vaise nahin aate team main
 It seems obvious
 nyaay kii devi kii tarah yahaan aankadon ke kuch devtaa baithte hai
 Deals are done by color, by religion, based on past performance and base rate of this time
 jaahir si baat he ki dhandhebaaj jab itnaa paisa lagaayenge, to munafa to saans sa jaruri hoga hi
 But in this racket, much more than cricket and entertainment has been sold, and is at stake
 khel or khilaadiyon kii pratishtha, lig kii vishwasaneeyata or isamen khun kii tarah behate paison ko lekar ho rahi uthaa patake ke najaare
 After all, why do Hindustani, who worship cricketers like God, are eager to see the idols of the idols selling in these markets
 aji khel to bahaanaa he
 The public key is the same as the organizers see elsewhere
 kabhi kisi kii dress, to kabhi dialog kaa, jab malikan ke in sab thath karmon kaa majaak banataa he, to public ko majaa aata he
 This is the same fun that comes in seeing the disrespect of older people
 ain us vakt apni kamatari kuch kam ho jaati he
 It seems that a gold-plated Seth, hidden in a silk belly, fell into the carcass as soon as he got out of the car, and the red cheeks were soothed
 cricket control sab kare, laalach par control koi nahinkalikh ne chibers kiya, to sabase pehle lapete main aae vahi, jinhone is shandaar jinn ko bottle se baahar nikaala tha
 The commissioner Lalit Modi, then called Magician, is now sitting in London
 cricket se pyaar he, magar court kaa khauf he, so desh lautne se inkaar he
 But bless this digital wonder
 landan main baithe baithe hi roj koste hai hindustan main cricket ke maujuuda aakaaon ko
 TV channel ask questions anything
 saanware or kabhi salone dikhte modi kaa jawaab ek hi vaakya se shuru hota he
 Srinivasan should resign immediately
 istipha bhi kya khub cheez he
 Who would know this better than Modi
 twit kiya or mantri tharur kii laal batti utar gai
 Then Modi himself became a foreigner as well
 magar en shrinivasana hai ki maanate nahin
 If you raise your finger on him, he stares with his big eyes, and the song starts playing in the background

 So this law was scared fifty years ago

 srilanka team ke spinner rangana herath kii pahchaan sirf yahi khatm nahin hoti
 This 'elderly' bowler is in the role of a strike bowler for his team today
 thik usee tarah jaise samay samay sarvakaleen mahaan spinneron main shumaar muthaiya muralidharan nibhaayaa karte the
 Herath can unquestionably be considered Sri Lanka's most successful spinner after Murali
 unki ginati ham duniya ke aise gendbaajon main bhi kar sakate hai jo lagaataar achche pradarshan ke baavjood vah prashansa nahin paa sakaa jiskaa ki vah hakdaar tha
 Herath's name recently came up for discussion when he achieved the rare feat of taking five wickets against all the test playing nations of the world
 zimbabwe ke khilaaf is match main herath ne kul 13 wicket (pehali pari main paanch or duusari main aath wicket ) jatke or captain ke rup main apni team ko jeet kaa tohfa diya
 When it comes to Sri Lankan cricket, there is a lot of discussion about Muralitharan and Chaminda Vaas in the field of bowling but Herath is often ignored
 khaas baat yah he ki murali kii tarah herath par 'chakar' kaa koi tag bhi nahin laga he
 Murali may have been a 'wizard' of the spin but his playing skills in Australia were declared a no-ball due to the charge of chucking his balls, passing biometric tests and the 'javelin thrower' address of the legendary spinner like Bishan Singh Bedi
 There was a slight glow saubhaahgya se herath ko ection ekadam clin he
 The average and strike rate of this 38-year-old Sri Lankan bowler is amazing
 herath ne ab tak 75 test maichon main 27
 351 wickets at an average of 97 (economy rate 2
 76 )hasil kiye hai
 His strike rate is 60
 7 kaa he yani lagbhag har 61 gend main ve wicket lene main kaamyaab rahe hai
 If we compare these figures with Murali, Murali's test career strike rate is 55
 0, iconomi rate 2
 47 and average 22
 72 kaa he
 Murali had taken 800 wickets in 133 Tests
 tippaniyan Herath, a left-arm leg-spinner, is known for consistently bowling and throwing long spells
 1999 main apane test kariyar kaa aagaaj karne vaale herath ko apane pehle hi match main mahaan murali ke saath mila
 Not only this, he played a role in the Australian innings with Murali in this test against Australia in Galle
 drow rahe is match main murali ne 71 ran dekar paanch or herath ne 97 ran dekar chaar wicket liye the
 It can be said about Herath that he has taken most of his wickets on home-friendly pitches
 gharelu maidan main jahaan unhone 41 test main 23
 He has taken 231 wickets at an average of 14 while in the 34 Tests played abroad, he has taken 120 wickets, including 24 wickets taken at the neutral venue
 videshi maidaanon main unka ausat 37 ke aasapaas kaa he
 Herath will soon become Sri Lanka's second most successful bowler
 tej gendbaaj chaminda vaas ke 355 test wicket ke record se ve mahaj chaar wicket hi peeche hai
 It has to be kept in mind that Vaas had taken these wickets in 111 Tests while Herath is just four wickets away from his record in only 75 Tests
 38 saal ke herath ne yadi aisa hi pradarshan jari rakhaa to apane viketon kaa aankada 400 ke paar pahunchaa sakate hai
 
 herath ko nirvivaad rup se murali ke baad srilanka kaa sabase kaamyaab spinner mana ja saktaa he
 We can also count him among such bowlers in the world who, despite consistently good performance, could not get the praise he deserved
 herath kaa naam haal main us samay charchaa main aayaa tha jab unhone duniya ke sabhi test plaing deshon ke khilaaf paanch wicket lene kii durlabh uplabdhi hasil kii thi
 In this match against Zimbabwe, Herath took a total of 13 wickets (five in the first innings and eight in the second) and gave his team the victory as a captain
 srilankai cricket kii jab baat hoti he to gendbaaji ke kshetra main muralidharan or chaminda vaas kii to khub charchaa hoti he lekin herath ko akasar nazarandaaj hi kar diya jaataa he
 The special thing is that like Murali, there is no tag of 'chakar' on Herath
 murali bhale hi spin ke 'jaadugar' rahe lekin australia main unki gendon ko chaking ke aarope ke kaaran no ball ghoshit kiye jane, boometric test se guzarane or bishan singh bedi jaise diggaj spinner ke 'jaevlin throre' ke sambodhan ke kaaran unke khel kaushal kii chamak malin jarur padi
 Luckily for Herath, the action is absolutely clean
 is 38 varshiya srilankai gendbaaj kaa ausat or strike rate kamaal kaa he
 Herath has made 27 of 75 Test matches so far
 97 ke ausat se 351 wicket (iconomi rate 2
 76)
 unka strike rate 60
 He has managed to take wickets in almost every 61 balls
 unke in aankadon kii agar murali se tulana karen to murali kaa test kariyar strike rate 55
 0, economy rate 2
 47 or ausat 22
 Is 72
 murali ne 133 test main 800 wicket hasil kiye the
 The comments baayen haath ke leg spinner herath ko lagaataar kasi hui gendbaaji or lambey spel phenkane ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Herath, who made his Test career debut in 1999, met the legendary Murali in his first match
 yahi nahin, australia ke khilaaf gaale main hue is test main unhone murali ke saath hi australian pari ko sametane main bhoomika nibhaai thi
 In this draw, Murali took five for 71 and Herath took four wickets for 97 runs
 herath ke bare main yah jarur kaha ja saktaa he ki unhone apane adhiktar wicket gharelu-madadgaar pichon par hi hasil kiye hai
 At home ground where he scored 23 in 41 tests
 14 ke ausat se 231 wicket liye hai vahiin videsh main khele gaye 34 test main 120 wicket liye hai, isamen neutral vaineu par hasil kiye gaye 24 wicket bhi shaamil hai
 He averages around 37 in foreign plains
 herath jald hi srilanka ke duusare sabase kaamyaab gendbaaj ban jaaenge
 He is just four wickets behind from paceman Chaminda Vaas's record of 355 Test wickets
 is baat ko dhyaan rakhana hoga ki vaas ne 111 test main ye wicket hasil kiye the jabaki herath mahaj 75 test main hi unke record se mahaj chaar wicket kii duuri par hai
 If 38-year-old Herath continues his performance, the figure of his wickets can cross 400
