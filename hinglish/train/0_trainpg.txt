 The election at that time was fought over the identity of Lingayat
 iske alaava jab saal 2013 main lingayat vot bant gaya, tab ham 56 siton par jite
 In this context, this time the performance of the Congress in the Lingayat dominated areas was not bad

 aapako yaad dilaa den ki 8 april ko narendra modi ne fikki kii mahila udhyamiyon ke saamne ek yuva mahila forest guard kaa bahut garv ke saath zikr kiya tha
 Modi had said, "people coming to roam in the forests are surprised to see this courageous girl more than the lions
" vah jis nidarta se junglee sheron ke bich gumti he, usne sabhi ko aashcharya main daal diya he
 "lush is only 26 years old, but she is looking very experienced in the Gujarat government's very ambitious campaign to save the only natural habitat of the Asiatic lions

 Today is the 95th birth anniversary of Vajpayee
 isi saal 16 agast ko unka nidhan ho gaya tha, lekin apni raajnneetik jindagi main unhone bijepi kii neenv rakhane se lekar shikhar tak pahunchaaya
 Vajpayee took many big and tough steps while being PM, which BJP presents as a picture of new India
 haalanki, unke kuch nirnay vivaadon main bhi rahe
 Let's look at some such decisions
 svarnim chaturbhuj yojanatal bihari vaajapeyi ne pradhanmantri rahete hue ek shahar ko duusare shahar se jodne ke liye svarnim chaturbhuj yojana kii shuruyaat kii thi
 Helped to connect Chennai, Kolkata, Delhi and Mumbai to the network of highways under the Golden Quadrilateral scheme

 In 1998, Vajpayee surprised the whole world by conducting 5 nuclear tests in Pokhran in a span of 2 days
 iske baad duniyabar ke tamaam desh bharat ke virodh main khadey ho gaye the
 Economic restrictions were imposed in many countries including America
 itnaa hi nahin, desh main vipaksh is mudde par sarkaar ko gherne main juta tha
 The country's economic condition had deteriorated, but today India is one of the strongest and nuclear-rich countries in front of the world
 sarv shiksha abhiyaantal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar ke sabase safal saamaajik abhiyaanon main se ek tha sarv shiksha abhiyaan
 Through this, this government had made a provision to provide free primary education to children between the ages of 6 to 14 years
 isi yojana kaa parinaam tha ki 2001 main launch hui is yojana ke jariye gaanv-gaanv skool khole gaye
 Calling Musharraf as India had done everything possible to bring Pakistan's relationship back on track
 dilli-lahore ke bich 1999 main bas seva shuru kii
 Not only this, Vajpayee's decision to hold a summit in Agra with the then President of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf in July 2001 after the infiltration of terrorists in Kargil was a very difficult step
 haalanki, yah baithak benatija nikali or donon deshon ke rishton main or bhi talkhi aa gai thi
 Only five months after the meeting, the Indian Parliament was attacked by the terrorists, this led to a lot of disgrace of the Vajpayee government
 qandahar main aatankiyon ko chhodanavajpeyi sarkaar main aatankiyon ne 24 disambar, 1999 ko indian airlines kii flite isi-814 ko hijank kar liya tha
 It had 176 passengers and 15 crew members

 To this day, questions are raised on BJP
 argedy supremeo lalu yadav or unke parivaar par lage bhrashtachar ke aaropon ko lekar bihar kii sattadhari mahagathmbdhan main chal rahi khinchataan ke bich nitish kumaar ne siem pad se istipha de diya
 In this case, the CBI and ED registered a case against the Yadav family and raided many places and the alleged corruption was being forced by the JDU camp to resign on behalf of Tejashwi Yadav
 haalanki tejasvi khud par lage in tamaam aaropon ko jhootha qaraar dete hue ise piem modi or amit shah kii sajeesh qaraar dete rahe hai
 Tejashwi said that the BJP is scared of a 28-year-old youth, so there is a conspiracy to implicate him
 aise main aaie jaanate hai tejasvi par aakhir kya aarope hai, jo mahagathbandhan ke khatme kaa kaaran bana-railway tender se jude aarope-sibiai ke 27 adhikariyon kii team ne pichley hafte lalu yadav ke 12 thikaanon par chhapemari kii or rabari devi tathaa unke chote bete tejasvi yadav se ghanton poochtacha kii
 According to sources, Tejasvi was asked questions related to the stake in Patna Mall
 sibiai ke atirikt nideshak rakesh asthana ne bataaya ki lalu ke railmantri rahane ke dauraan railway ko do hotalon ke rakrakhaav ke liye ek privet company ko tender diya gaya or iske aivaj main lalu ko teen acre jameen di gai
 These tenders were awarded through the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) between 2004 and 2009, when Lalu was the Railway Minister

 Charges regarding free gifts - Lalu family's rains for free gifts of crores in last few years are also under investigation
 isamen bhi tejasvi ke naam par kai sampattiyon kii len-dein hui inaki jaanch chal rahi he
 BJP leader Sushil Modi has made many allegations against the Lalu family in the last two months
 susheel modi ke anusaar, upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav or unke bhai va swasthya mantri tejpratap kii khud or unke parivaar kii ek hajaar karod se zyada kii benami sampattiyaan hai
 The BJP leader alleges that the land where the Lalu family's mall is being built in Patna has been given the name of Lalu's sons by party leader Premchand Gupta
 prem gupta kii company is mal kii jameen kii maalik thi or baad main usne ise lalu yadav kii patni rabari devi or unke beton tejpratap yadav or tejasvi yadav ke naam kar diya
 Apart from this, Tejashwi and Tej Pratap also got crores of gifts from uncle and grandfather, which are under investigation

 Lalu's daughter-son-in-law is also under investigation, Laloo's daughter Misa Bharti and son-in-law Shailesh Kumar are also under the ed's scanner

 ED on Tuesday questioned Misa Bharti for 8 hours in Delhi and Shailesh was summoned on Wednesday
 lalu parivaar in sab jaanchon ke liye modi sarkaar par siyaasi badale kaa aarope laga rahaa he
 Tejaswi's clarification, however, on these allegations, Tejaswi Yadav said that i was 13-14 years old when this scam was being told in 2004
 is umr main ghotaalaa kaise kar saktaa hum
 Then i did not even grow my mustache
 iske saath hi unhone kaha, 'pehle din se hi hamaari niti karpshan ke maamle main jiro tolerance kii rahi he
 The FIR that has taken place is under the conspiracy of Amit Shah and Modi ji under a political conspiracy

 mukhya chunaav ayukta esene jaidi apane saathi ayukta o pi ravat kii chitthee par jaldbaaji main koi faisla nahin lenge

 Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had commented in an interview that he did not trust the Election Commission, as he had worked with PM Modi in Gujarat
 lihaaja un par vishwaas nahin kiya ja saktaa ki wo hamaari shikayaton par nishpaksh rahenge
 After this, OP Rawat expressed his desire to separate himself from the hearing of cases related to the Aam Aadmi Party so that Kejriwal and the general public will have confidence in the Commission
 chunaav ayog ke ucch padasth sutron ke mutabik is chitthee par aage kaise kadam uthaaya jaay is bare main bhi ayog baithak main vichaar karegaa
 It is a different matter that the credibility of Rawat's partner and senior Election Commissioner AK Joti was also questioned by Kejriwal
 lekin joti ne saaf kar diya ki wo nishpaksh or swatantra rup se apni sanvaidhanik jimmedaari nibhaayenge
 In any case, they will not separate themselves from hearing any case
 baharhaal, ayog ke paas aam aadmi party ke kai maamle vichaaradhin hai
 The latest among them is about the credibility of tovms, while the case of 21 Aam Aadmi Party mlas being in the position of profit is also very important

 In the Downing Street office, the Prime Minister said, "this is a possibility and we cannot ignore that there is a large group of individuals behind this attack
 " He announced that the army would be deployed on the streets to support the armed police
 iskaa matlab yah hoga ki sabhi mukhya jagahon par jahaan kii suraksha kii jimmedaari sashastr police kii he, unke sthaan par sena ko tainaat kiya jayega or sena mukhya jagahon kii nigaraanee badhaane ke liye police ko nirdesh degi

 " unhone ghoshnaa kii ki sashastr police kaa samarthan karne ke liye sena kii sadakon par tainaat kiya jayega
 This would mean that in all the main places where the armed police is responsible for the security, the army would be deployed in their place and the army would direct the police to increase surveillance of the main places
 unhone kaha ki vishesh tarah ke aayojanon yaa khelon ke dauraan janata kii suraksha ke liye sena kii tainaati se police ko madad milegi

 ek april se sabhi tambaakoo ke product par 85 fisadi pictorial warning chhapana anivaary ho gaya he
 However, it will not have an effect on all the tobacco products sold in the markets
 iske nirmaataaon ko purana stock khatm karne ke liye teen maheene kaa vakt diya gaya he
 The notification was released last year by the Health Ministry, through a notification in October last year, making it mandatory for all tobacco products to cover 85% of the postpolar warning from April 1, 2016
 iske liye cigarette or tambaakoo se bane saamaan adhinium 2003 main badlaav kar nayaa kanoon banaaya gaya he, jiske tahat sabhi product paratambakoose hone vaale nuksaan, bimariyon ke bare main 60 fisadi chetavanee detii tasviren or 25 fisadi likhit jaankaree chhapni hogi
 The old stock will have to be finished in 3 months, so this law will come into force across the country from April 1, but it may not be seen in the products sold in the market, because all the manufacturers have given 3 months to finish the old stock
 has gone
 health ministry ke ek adhikari ke mutabik, nae batch ke tambaakoo prodect par agar ek april likhaa hoga, to usapar pictorial warning chhapni jaruri hogi
 Why a new law was enacted in October 2014 when the then Health Minister, Dr
 harshavardhan ne pictorial warning ko 1 april 2015 le lagu karne kii ghoshnaa kii thi, lekin tab ye kanoon lagu nahin kiya ja sakaa
 After this, a petition was filed in the Rajasthan High Court, after which the Health Ministry started work to implement this law
 ab shuukravaar se ye kanoon lagu ho rahaa he
 Copies of the new law and cds of pictorial warnings are also being given by the Ministry of Tobacco Products to the Ministry
 kanoon main ho saktaa he badlaavparliament health cameti ne 50 fisadi pictorial warning kii sifarish kii he
 The Health Ministry still has 3 months to implement these recommendations or not
 ek adhikari ke mutabik, warning fisadi kam karne ke liye mantralay se baatcheet chal rahi he
 It is possible that within three months this law will change slightly

 chunaav ayog kii ore se 20 vidhayakon ko ayogy tehraane kii sifarish ke khilaaf dilli hoicourt pahunchi aam aadmi party (AAP) ko tagada jhatka laga he
 The High Court has refused to grant immediate relief to AAP legislators
 saath hi somvaar ko sunwaayee karne kaa faisla liya he
 During this, the High Court reprimanded the AAP mlas, saying that you did not go to the Election Commission in time and did not even reply to the notice
 court ne sawaal daaga ki aakhir aap chunaav ayog ke sampark main kyon nahin rahe? court ne kaha ki jab aap bulaane par bhi nahin gaye, to ab ayog maamle par faisla lene ke liye swatantra he
 In fact, six AAP mlas have reached the High Court after the Election Commission recommended to the President to be disqualified
 ab somvaar ko hoicourt maamle kii sunwaayee karegaa
 At the same time, the Aam Aadmi Party has called a high-level meeting to chalk out a strategy for the decision of the Election Commission
 AAP sanyojak or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke ghar par party kii ucchstareey baithak chal rahi he
 AAP leader Raghav Chadha, MLA Commando Surendra, MLA from Ambedkar Nagar Ajay Dutt and other leaders and activists are participating in this meeting
 saath hi AAP vidhayakon ke kejariwal ke ghar pahunchane kaa silsilaa jari he
 The issue of disqualifying 20 mlas is being discussed in this meeting
 iske alaava rashtriya rajdhani dilli main phir se chunaav hone kii sambhaavnaaon ke maddenjar congress or bijepi ne apni taiyaariyaan shuru kar di he
 After the Election Commission's decision on Friday, Congress also held a meeting regarding its preparations
 AAP ne chunaav ayog par bolaa hamalaam aadmi party ke netaa saurabh bharadwaj ne kaha ki jis laabh ke pad kaa aarope lagaaya ja rahaa he, jabaki aisa kuch hua hi nahin he
 Our legislators did not take advantage of the government car, government bungalow and salary
 chunaav ayog ne is maamle main hamaari baat nahin suni
 No MLA has been given a chance to speak
 saurabh bharadwaj ne kaha ki mukhya chunaav ayukta eke jyoti ne gujarat main piem modi ke under main kaam kiya he
 Now they are paying the debt of PM Modi
 23 janvari ko unka janmdin he or somvaar ko ritair ho rahe hai
 So want to settle all the work before leaving
 saurabh ne kaha ki somvaar ke baad naa hi modi ji or naa hi brahma ji eke jyoti ko mukhya chunaav ayukta ke pad par rakh sakate hai
 The complainant said- AAP mlas will be canceled membership, Prashant Patel who complained in the matter said that it is completely clear, these 20 mlas of Aam Aadmi Party will be defeated
 unhone kaha, "maine yah maamla saal 2015 main uthaaya tha
 Looking at the entire case, it seems that the membership of these mlas will be lost
 chunaav ayog apana faisla raashtrapati ke paas bhejega, jis par raashtrapati apni manjuuri denge
 "he further said," There is no scope for the membership of AAP mlas to escape, as the Chief Secretary of the Government of Delhi himself, in his affidavit to the Commission, admitted that the mlas were given facilities like ministers
 dilli main saat vidhayak mantri ho sakate hai, lekin inhone 28 bana die
 "on the other hand, the central government objected to the Delhi High Court opposing the decision to appoint mlas as parliamentary secretaries and said that there could be only one parliamentary secretary in Delhi, which would be with the Chief Minister
 in vidhayakon ko yah pad dene kaa koi sanvaidhanik praavdhaan nahin he

 isamen koi shaq nahin ki aaj tak visheshgy bhi acute encephelitis syndrome (aes)ke failane ke karno kaa pataa lagane main vifal rahe hai,lekin bakaul nitish kumaar,is baar swasthya vibhaag adhikari beemaari kii rokthaam ke liye prachaar-prasar karne main vifal rahe
 Nitish Kumar himself also ignored this aspect in the post-election department-wise review
 vaise nitish kumaar ke shashan kaal main varsh2014ke baad is beemaari ke marizon kii taadaad main kami ai he,or uskaa kaaran yahi rahaa he ki praathmik swasthya centre se hi ilaaj ke adhikansh upaay kar liye gaye,or unhen centre sarkaar ke nirdesh par majboot kiya gaya,lekin jaisaa har sarkari kaam ke saath hota he,baad main sabhi kaan main tel daalkar so gaye
 Nitish Kumar himself must have felt that this time the responsibility of the death of the children is on him, because he did not take the disease seriously
 adhikariyon ke saath kii gai samiksha baithak ko apane tak simit rakhaa or15din ke baad aspataal jaakar unhone safai se lekar doctor bhejne tak ke jo faisle kiye (ve nishchit rup se saraahneey hai),ve unhone kuch din pehle daura kar le liye hote,to nishchit rup se kai bacchon kii jaan batch sakati thi
 Nitish was running away from his responsibility and the time he wasted in making political discussions in Delhi would have been spent in the hospital in Muzaffarpur, he could have avoided his place in the media across the country today
 vaise,ek or bhi kaaran hai,jiske liye nitish kumaar ko koi maaf nahin kar saktaa - vah he,swasthya vibhaag ke kaamon main unki koi ruchi na hona
 If they had taken interest in this department, the hospitals would not have been ill today
 na doctor hai,na nurse
 Nitish pats his back by presenting figures comparing the lalu-rabri regime in every case, but the truth is that leave Sadar Hospital, nowhere does the X-ray machine in any hospital work properly, for the children
 Let it be a matter of facilities
 nitish jis din aspataalon main aane vaale marizon or unke rishtedaaron,bhale hi mariz thik hokar chuttee paakar gaye hon,yaa kaal ke gaal main samaa gaye hon,se milenge,or kaaran jaanane kii koshish karenge,to unhen sachai kaa pataa chal jayega
 This time the death of such a large number of children has exposed the claims of their work in the health sector and their claims, so now the media will not solve the problem, nor will the lives of children be saved
 nitish kumaar ko yaad rakhana hoga ki agar tali captain ko milti he,to gaali bhi captain ko hi milti he
 Now let's talk about Sushil Modi
 haalanki swasthya vibhaag se unka koi lenaa-dena nahin he,lekin un par doshaaropan isliye zaruri he,kyonki sau se bhi zyaada bacchon kii maut ho jane par bhi unhone swasthya mantri mangal pandey se istipha nahin dilvaaya
 Modi is the same politician who had been demanding resignation from Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for months on the deaths of children after eating a mid-day meal in Chhapra district in 2013
 vaise to modi ko khud hi isaki naitik zimmedaari lekar istipha de dena chahie tha,kyonki vittamantri ke rup main unhone hi swasthya vibhaag ke bajet main katautee kii he,or paise ke abhaav main hi bhawan nahin bane
 Sushil Modi himself also tweeted that he will meet Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to seek financial help for the children's ICU in Muzaffarpur
 raajnneetik akhaade main har rose apane virodhiyon ko naseehat dene vaale susheel modi is baat par puri tarah maun hai ki swasthya mantri mangal pandey mujaffarpur main biimaar bacchon se milane se pehle party ke kaaryakramon main itane sakriy kyon the,or kya modi ko mangal pandey se isi aadhaar par istipha nahin le lenaa chahie
 When Modi himself came to the hospital with Nitish Kumar, and he was asked questions, he started giving advice to media persons only
 susheel modi ne aaj tak is baat par bhi koi safai nahin di he ki akhir varsh2014main kendriya swasthya mantri harshavardhan dwaara kii gai ghoshnaa par ab tak amal kyon nahin kiya gaya he
 Even after five years of the announcement of the second AIIMS in Bihar, the foundation of Sushil Modi, who praised the government of 'six engines' in everything, is not shameful even after its foundation has been laid
 pichley14varsh ke dauraan chaar saal ko chhodkar yah mantralay hameshaabhjhfke mantriyon ke paas hi rahaa he or uske baavjood agar swasthya vibhaag biimaar he,tobhbhjhphke mantriyon kii baithak main upmukhyamantri hone ke naate maujuud rahane vaale susheel modi zimmedaari lene se sirf isi tark se batch sakate hai - hamase pehle lalu-rabari shasankaal main kisi ne zimmedaari nahin lee thi,to ham kyon len

 You have warmly welcomed Narendra Bhai to all the leaders

 Therefore, i also welcome this Veerabhoomi Jhansi and its sons
 narendra bhai yah bundelkhand kii dharti veeron kii dharti he
 It is said about here
 ki yahaan ke bundelon ke upar 52 tir chubhe hote the, phir bhi dushmano ke hausale post kar dete the
 The brothers of Bundelkhand may have seen poverty, but did not compromise on Aan Baan Shan
 lekin sabase bada abhishaap jo jhelana pad rahaa he, vah garibi kaa he, berogari kaa he
 i can say that the percentage of poverty and unemployment is higher than other areas of UP

 But what Narendra Bhai has done in Gujarat today

 He is being praised not only in his country but also abroad
 america bhi isaki prashansa kar rahaa he
 So, i am sure that the day the PM takes over the reins
 usee din desh kii takadir or tasviir badal jaaegi
 The BJP believes that we really want to bring Mother India to the pinnacle of glory
 to ye tabhi hoga, jab samaaj kii antim seedhi par baitha vyakti, jis din uske chehre par muskaan ho jaaegi, usee din tarakkee hogi

 yahaan logon ko yaad dilaanaa chahta hum
 The BJP started the process of connecting villages with paved roads in independent India
 jab bijepi kii sarkaar nahin thi
 Before that, when we used to take loans from the bank for farming, there was a loan at an interest rate of more than 14 percent
 2003 main bijepi kii sarkaar ne kisaan credit card dekar 8
 Started lending at the rate of 5 percent
 aage kya hua
 i saw it after becoming the bjp's national president
 jahaan bijepi kii sarkaar he, vahaan siem se apil kii
 No loan interest should be taken from any farmer at a rate above 4%
 aapane gujarat nahin dekha
 Must have seen Madhya Pradesh
 vahaan par hamaare kisaan bhaaiyon ko ek fisadi or shunya fisadi dar par karj muhaiyaa karaayaa ja rahaa he
 i also want to assure you
 jis din bijepi ko das baras ke liye shashan chalaane kaa mauka mil jayega
 We will decide that not a single peasant family survives, in which, apart from farming, a son, a young man does not get a job opportunity, such a family is not left
 naujavaanon, tumhaare sapane bijepi kii sarkaar hi puraa kar sakati he
 When Modi becomes PM, this Bundelkhand should have a special eye
 maine dekha he ki aapane gujarat ke pichde ilaake main aapane vishesh dhyaan diya
 Special work has been done in tribal areas
 aapako vahaan dikhataa he ki hukumat kaise chalaai jaati he

 -input IANS se Your personal and professional success depends on how you are able to impress others with your words
 yah ek kala he or aapke kariyar kii saxes main iskaa behad ahm role he
 With good presentation skills, you can progress a lot in your career
 in tips ko dhyaan main rakhkar aap apane pregentation skills ko impruva kar sakate hai
 (1) Choose strong facts to make your point: The art of speaking has a very special importance in the presentation
 lekin sirf kuch bhi bolkar apni baat dusron ko nahin samajha sakate hai
 Therefore, you must also have the necessary facts to prove your point
 jo aapke points kaa majbootee se samarthan karte hon
 With this kind of communication you can succeed in winning the confidence of the front party
 (2) vishay ko samajhen:yaad rakhen ki ek behatar pregentation ke mukhya rup se do paksh hote hai- achche tareeke se likhaa gaya content or use bolne kaa prabhaavshaalee tarika
 Apart from these, there can be many ways to improve the presentation
 (3) graphics ke madhyam se samajhaayen apni baat:aapako kam samay main apni baat samjaani he to graphics se acha tarika nahin he
 You prepare your topic through PPT or graphics
 ek kahawat to aapane suni hogi ki jo dikhataa he wo bikta he
 So whatever you want to explain in the presentation, you must explain it through graphics
 iske liye peepiti pregentation kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 (4) Use magic words: Before giving a presentation, it is important that you understand that words have more effect on people than magic
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki aap plis jaise shabdon kaa istemaal karen
 Choose words that make the person in front of you feel connected
 darasal pregentation main aapako sunne vaale ko jo apekshaayen hoti he usamen aapako khara utarana hota he
 So you have to explain them in the same style
 bina kisi halke hansi majaak ke apni baat samajhakar aap kabhi bhi saamne vaale ko impress nahin kar sakate hai
 (5) Avoid being nervous: If you become nervous once during the presentation, it will affect your body language
 ek baar lay tut gai to phir aap vishay se bhatak sakate hai
 For this, it is important that you are aware of the content closely
 pregentation se pehle aap abhyaas karen or khud main aatmavishvaas badhayen
 If you have overcome these obstacles then no one can stop your project from being successful

 Those who were transferred to the Transport Department on 24 March

 The notification of the Personnel Administrative Department was asked to contribute with immediate effect and raise the salary for the month of March from the new place

 Your sweet and your extension partner has suddenly become irritable and angry or has stayed away from you
 yah sanket bhi isi ore ishaara karata he ki uski dilchaspee kisi naye rishte main bad rahi he

 partner kaa vyavhaar bilkul badal gaya ho
 His body language is completely different

 ) All people need solitude and peace at some time
 sabhi ke jivan main ek samay aisa aata he jab vyakti khud ke saath kuch samay bitaana chahta he
 However, people often refer to a person living alone as a depression
 lekin ab ek nai study ne is baat ko galat sabit kar diya he
 According to the new study, children who want to live in solitude, understand themselves better and are more able to accept themselves
 uniwarsity of california, santa cruge or vilmington college ne milakar yah study kii he
 According to the study, children who want to be alone on their own will understand life better
 jabaki, agar bacchon ko akele rahane ke liye majaboor kiya jaae, to ye unki life par nakaaratmak asar daalata he
 Children can also become a victim of depression due to this
 bataa den, pichhali kuch study main aisa daawa kiya gaya tha ki akele rahane se insaan depressant kaa shikaar ho saktaa he
 But according to this new study, living in solitude is also an art which has to be learned
 shodhakartaaon ne bataaya ki pichhali kai study main ekant main samay bitaane ko akelepan or sharmile swabhaav kaa naam diya gaya tha
 It is believed that children who spend most of their time alone do not get along quickly
 shodhakartaaon ne aage bataaya ki har vyakti ko ye pataa hona chahie ki unhen kab akele rahanaa he or kab duusare logon ke saath time spend karnaa he
 This study emphasizes the advantages of living alone of your own will and happiness
 study ke dauraan saamne aayaa ki jo log soshal bycott ke chalate akelaa rahanaa chaahate hai, unamem tanaav kii samasya aam hoti he
 The risk of depression in those people is also high
 lekin vahiin agar koi akelaa apni ichha se rahanaa chahta he, to unako koi bhi samasya nahin hoti he, balki aise log apni jidangi main khush or swasth rahete hai
 Researchers have also emphasized that in today's busy life, we either spend most of the time on social media or get busy with our work
 iske chalate ham khud ke liye samay nikaal hi nahin pate hai or akele rahane kii kala bhi nahin sikh pate hai

 This blog says, 'today whatsapp is finally expanding the scope of its test, group privacy settings are now being given to more and more Android and ios users

 afghanistan team ne nagin dance ke liye mashhoor bangladeshi team ko haraakar itihaas rach daalaa or siries main 3-0 se jeet darj kii
 Afghan players were so engrossed in celebrations that the serpent started dancing
 aakhir aisa karne kaa mauka bhi tha, kyonki afgani ranvankuron ne virdohi team kaa white wash jo kar diya tha
 In the match played at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium in Dehradun, winning the toss and batting first, Afghanistan scored 145 runs after losing six wickets in the scheduled 20 overs, which Bangladesh missed by just one run
 bangladesh ko chakhaaya majaabangladeshi khilaadi match ke dauraan afgani ballebaajon ke out hone par nagin dance kar jashn manaa rahe the
 Whenever an Afghan batsman was out, the Bangladeshi serpent would dance
 ant main match kaa parinaam afghanistan ke haq main gaya, to uske khilaadiyon ne bhi nagin dance kar apni jeet kaa jashn manaaya
 FIFA 2018: This is the world's most expensive playing XI Nagin Dance, worth 91 billion rupees, was started by Sri Lanka in Nidahas Trophy
 bangladeshi team or uske samarthak jahaan jate hai vahaan nagin dance karte he
 The Bangladeshi team has an old habit of losing consciousness
 FIFA world cap main number 1 rank ke saath utregi germany kii timbangladesh ko antim over kii antim gend par jeet ke liye chaar ranon kii jarurat thi, lekin mahamudullah do ran puraa karne ke saath out ho gaye or is kaaran unki team ek ran se is match ko haar gai
 According to the Mahant of Ayodhya Hanuman Garhi and Gyanadas, President of the Akhara Council, the construction of the Ram temple was resolved only a few days after the High Court's decision
 babari masjid ke muddai hashim ansaari ke saath baatcheet ke baad ramamandir se jude sabhi pakshon ke bich unhone sahmati bhi bana lee thi
 The draft of the agreement was about to be signed, but the agreement could not be reached due to BJP leaders Vinay Katiyar and Ashok Singhal
 kyonki ye log ram mandir kaa nirmaan nahin chaahate balki is mudde par apni dukaan chalaanaa chaahate hai
 Hashim Ansaribari Masjid removed from Babri's lawsuit Hashim Ansari, the head of the Babri Masjid, who had not announced his case to defend the case and liberated Ramlala, had already indicated that he and Gyanadas had resolved the issue
 hindu or musalmaan sabhi pakshon se baat bhi ho gai thi
 In this context, the revelation of Gyanadasa becomes important
 gyaandas ne kaha, 'elahabaad hoicourt ke nirnay ke duusare-tisare din ham logon ne sulah-samjhaute kii baat kii thi
 It also had Hashim Ansari, Ramlala Virajman and Nirmohi Arena
 chakrapani ji hindu mahasabha ko bhi bulaayaa gaya tha
 Everyone agreed
 bill bhi taiyaar ho gaya, par dastakhat nahin ho paaya
 Only the people of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, whether Vinay Katiyar or Ashok Singhal, prevented the compromise
 janata inhen dharmik samajhati he lekin ye adharmee log hai
 They were never in favor of Lord Rama's temple because they all run their own shops and run their business
 isliye unhone aisa hone nahin diya
 'it is worth mentioning that Hashim Ansari, the main issue of Babri Masjid, who had announced not to advocate the Babri Masjid case and to get Ramlala free, had made it clear on Tuesday night that he and Gyanadas had resolved the issue
 hindu or musalmaan sabhi pakshon se baat bhi ho gai thi
 But the agreement could not be reached after the vhp-backed Virajman Ramlala moved to the Supreme Court
 desh main tarakkee kii raftaar tej karne ke chakkar main modi sarkaar ke do mantralayon main than gai he
 On the one hand, the Environment Ministry says that it is trying to remove 'road blocks' from the path of development projects
 vahiin, duusari ore adivasee maamalon ke mantralay ne kade shabdon main kaha he ki paryaavaran mantralay uske (adivasee maamle mantralay ke) adhikaron main atikaraman kar rahaa he
 The Ministry of Tribal Affairs has accused the Ministry of Environment for not only ignoring the Forest Rights Act (FRA), but also weakening it to protect the rights of tribals
 adivasee maamalon ke mantralay ke sachiv hrishikesh pandas ne paryaavaran sachiv ashok lavasa ko likhi chitthee main kade shabdon main kaha he ki ekaare ko lagu karana or uske paalan par nazar rakhana adivasee maamalon ke mantralay kaa kaam he, paryaavaran mantralay kaa nahin
 In the letter, Panda has written that despite this, the Ministry of Environment has tried to weaken the FRA by issuing an order on October 28, which is illegal
 gauratlab he ki paryaavaran mantralay kii oly se oktober main jari kiye gaye circular main sadak, rail or duusare ekarekheey project or mining ke kuch maamalon main riyaayat dene kii baat kahi gai he
 This is considered to be an underestimation of the Forest Rights Act (FRA) for the tribals, under which the consent of the tribals is required for the project in the forest land
 mantralayon ke bich ye takaraav isliye ahm ho gaya he kyonki ekaare ko lekar khud pradhanmantri ke daftar main meeting ho chuki he ki jisamen paryaavaran mantralay or adivasee maamalon ke mantralay ke adhikari shaamil hue
 NDTV India had reported that the notifications of the Ministry of Environment are raising questions about the FIA to speed up the development project
 ab adivasee maamalon ke mantralay ke sachiv hrishikesh pandas kii chitthee (jisaki ek copy enditivi india ke paas he) se ye baat khulkar saamne aa gai he
 In his letter, Panda has written, 'FIA is the law of this country
 aapaki (28 oktober kii) chitthee iskaa ulanghan karti he
 Whoever is adopting a 'shot-cut' project of development can be stopped only on the complaint of a village which has forest land ' is chitthee main paryaavaran mantralay ko ye bhi kaha gaya he ki, 'is baat kaa koi subut nahin he ekaare kii vajah se vikaas ke project main deree hoti he
 'panda has written to the environment secretary that the green signal under the FRA can be taken sooner than the Forest Protection Act and the Land Acquisition Act for any project, so the circular that relaxes this law should be withdrawn immediately
 haalanki paryaavaran mantri jaavdekar baar-baar kehete rahe hai ki sarkaar kisi kanoon kii andekhi nahin kar rahi he or kanoon main bhi badlaav honge wo sansad kii anumati se hi kiye jaaenge
 On July 19, a bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha, The Child Labor (prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Bill 2016
 jab bhi bacchon kii mazdooree se sambandhit kanoon banane kii baat hoti he, bahaane bahut se yaad aane lagate hai
 In 1986, when Parliament enacted a law that children under 18 years of age could not be provided wages, there was a question that it would be difficult for poor families
 duusari taraf yah bhi kehane vaale log hote hai ki aisa karne se bachapan chhin jaataa he
 It is the responsibility of the government to provide facilities to the children for their education and not to get wages from them
 saal 2012 main bhi isamen kuch dheel di gai or 2016 main kaha ja rahaa he ki is kanoon ko naram bana diya gaya he
 Is that really so? bal sudhaar sanshodhan bill 14 saal se kam umr ke bacchon ko kisi bhi tarah ke udhyam yaa naukari main rakhane ke khilaaf he
 But children from 14 to 18 years are allowed to work there as non-hazardous ie there is no danger
 yah bachche parivaar ke kaarobaar jaise rashan kii dukaan vagairah main kaam kar sakate hai lekin kisi chemical factory main nahin
 Labor Minister Bandaru Dattatreya introduced it and passed
 is bill ko loksabhaa main pesh kiya janaa he
 According to this bill, a child between 14 and 18 years of age is considered a juvenile
 baccha vah he jisaki umr 14 saal se kam he
 It is the responsibility of the government to provide free and compulsory education to children of this age as per the 2009 law
 nayaa bill kahata he ki koi bhi baccha kisi kaam main nahin lagaaya jayega
 But this law will not be applicable when the child is helping his family or family employment, in the spare time after school or during holidays and employment is not dangerous
 agar baccha tivi, film, vigyaapan aadi main kalakaar ke rup main kaam karata he to kanoon lagu nahin hoga
 It has to be ensured that school education is not affected while doing all this
 kendriya shram mantri bandaaru dattatreya kaa kahana he ki paariwarik kaarobaar main maalik-majdoor kaa sambandh nahin hota he
 Children below 14 years are being given an exception
 mata-pita ke liye vah apwaad hai
 Not only this, the number of hazardous industries has been reduced from 83 to 3
 ab sirf khadaan, jvalansheel padaarth or visphotak udyog ko hi khatarnaak mana gaya he
 Children can work in zari, bangle market, clothing store or factory
 nae bill main sajaa kaa praavdhaan sakht kiya gaya he
 The comments bal shram ke maamalon main ab kam se kam 6 maheene se lekar 2 saal tak kii sajaa hogi
 The fine has been increased from 20,000 to 50,000
 agar maa-baap ne kaam kii ijaajat nahin di he to unhen sajaa nahin milegi
 If a parent or guardian commits an offense more than once, they can be fined Rs 10,000
 jabaki sansadeey samiti ne kuch or hi suzav die the jinamein se kai ahm sujhaavon ko bill main shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 On 13 December 2013, the Parliamentary Committee on Labor and Employment stated in its forty-ninth report
 
 
 bacchon dwaara skool ke ghanton ke baad apane parivaar kii madad karne kaa praavdhaan bill se hataaya janaa chahie
 The definition of at-risk work should also include work that harms the health safety and ethics of adolescents
 kishoron ko kisi bhi rojgaar main karyrat hone se pehle apni praathmik shiksha puri kerani chahie
 Vigilance and inspection committees headed by local mps should be entrusted with the task of reviewing the implementation of the Child Labor Act instead of the District Magistrate
 bill ke section 17 main joda gaya he ki sarkaar apni shaktiyaan or katarvy jiladhikari ko de sakati he
 The District Officer shall see whether the provisions of this law apply properly
 jila adhikari chaahe to apane maatahat ko yah power de saktaa he
 Is this enough Children under 14 years are exempt from child labor
 kya 14 saal se 18 saal ke bacchon ko khatarnaak udyogon se mukt kiya gaya he? khatarnaak udyog hi nahin hote, kai jagah udyog khatarnaak nahin ho saktaa he magar kaam karne kii sthiti khatarnaak ho sakati he
 Is there any clarity about this? Child labor is an important issue worldwide
 iske naam par bacchon ke saath kya-kya nahin hota he or unase kya-kya nahin karaayaa jaataa he
 Child labor is also a matter of getting more work done at lower wages
 yah bachche kii apni majaburi ho sakati he magar usase zyada udyogon ke liye jaruri ho jaataa he
 Campaigns against child labor go on from time to time
 ab ek bill paas hua he to use lekar jashn kyon nahin he? awam main charchaa aam kyon nahin he? The Child Reform Amendment Bill is against placing children under 14 in any kind of enterprise or job
 lekin 14 se 18 saal tak ke bacchon ko non-hazardous yani jinamein koi khatra na ho, vahaan mazdooree karne kii ijaajat he
 These children can work in family business such as ration shop, but not in any chemical factory
 shram mantri bandaaru dattatreya ne ise pesh kiya or paas ho gaya
 This bill has to be introduced in the Lok Sabha
 is bill ke anusaar 14 se 18 saal ke bachche ko kishor mana gaya he
 The child is one whose age is below 14 years
 is umr ke bachche ko 2009 ke kanoon ke anusaar muft or anivaary shiksha dene kii jimmedaari sarkaar kii he
 The new bill states that no child will be employed in any work
 lekin jab balak apane parivaar yaa parivaar ke rojgaar main madad kar rahaa ho, skool ke baad ke khaali samay main yaa chhuttiyon main or rojgaar khatarnaak nahin he to yah kanoon lagu nahin hoga
 The law will not apply if the child works as an artist in TV, film, advertising etc
 yah sunishchit karnaa hoga ki yah sab karte hue skool kii padhai prabhavit na ho
 Union Labor Minister Bandaru Dattatreya says that there is no owner-worker relationship in the family business
 14 saal ke neeche ke bacchon ko ek apwaad main mauka diya ja rahaa he
 He is an exception for parents
 yahi nahin khatarnaak udyogon kii sankhya 83 se ghataakar 3 kar di gai he
 Now only mines, flammable materials and explosive industries are considered dangerous
 zari, chuudi bazaar, kapadon kii dukaan yaa kaarkaane main bachche kaam kar sakate hai
 The new bill tightens the provision of punishment
 tippaniyan In cases of child labor, there will now be a sentence of at least 6 months to 2 years
 jurmaane kii raashi 20,000 se lekar 50,000 kar di gai he
 If the parents have not allowed work, then they will not get punishment
 maa-baap yaa sangrakshak ek baar se zyada aparaadh karte hai to un par 10,000 rupye kaa jurmaana lag saktaa he
 While the Parliamentary Committee had made some other suggestions, many of the important suggestions have not been included in the bill

 Officials on both sides said that the two leaders will not only formulate an action plan to resolve their differences, but will also try to strengthen their relationship further
 tay kaarykram ke anusaar, obama or sharif kii mulaakaat 90 minute kii hogi
 Prior to the meeting, the White House said it would underline the importance of us-pakistan relations and provide an opportunity to strengthen cooperation on issues related to mutual consent such as energy, trade, economic development, regional stability and combating violent extremism

 VHP kaa kahana he ki bharat main jo bhi musalmaan hai, unke purvaj hindu hi the
 Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) working president Alok Kumar says that these people who talk about ganga-jamuna Tehzeeb and teach us the lesson of tolerance, find out
 unhone kaha ki aaj sirf bharat hi nahin balki duniya ke kai muslim deshon main ramlila hoti he
 Alok Kumar said that we believe that the ancestors of all Muslims in India were Hindus
 unhone kaha ki agar koi musalmaan durga pandal main jaakar nachaata hai to isamen kuch galat nahin he
 On the other hand, if a Hindu gives a coup in the month of Ramadan, it does not mean that he has converted his religion
 VHP ke kaaryakari adhyaksh ne kaha ki mujhe lagata he ki agar koi musalmaan durga pandal main naachata he to isamen kuch bhi galat nahin he

 (from input language) 4 janvari 1994 ko hindi sangeet jagat sitare pancham da ne apni antim saans lee thi
 Born in Calcutta on 27 June 1939 Pancham da died at the age of just 54 years
 pancham daaka puraa naam rahul dev burman tha
 RD Burman is counted among the original composers of the Hindi film industry
 unhen hameshaa pancham da ke naam se pukaara jaataa rahaa or is naam ke peeche bhi kai kahaniyaan hai
 Music ran in his blood and father Sachin Dev Burman was a big music composer in the film industry and Pancham Da learned music lessons from him
 1960 ke dashak se 1990 ke dashak takardy burman ne 331 filmon main sangeet diya
 RD was famous for his music as much as for his voice
 kai filmon main unhone khud gaanaa bhi gaaya he
 As a musician, he has mostly worked with his wives Asha Bhosle and Kishore (da) Kumar
 in donon ke saath unhone jabardast hit gane duniya ko die
 He has always been called the next generation musician and many composers have moved forward taking inspiration from him
 pancham da kii maut ke baad bhi unke gane superhit hote rahe hai
 In childhood, his grandmother was nicknamed Tublu, although later he became famous with the surname of Pancham
 pancham naam padane ke peeche kai kahaniyaan hai
 According to a story, when he used to cry in childhood, he used to cry in the fifth verse (paa), hence he was named Pancham
 duusari kahani yah he ki ve bachapan main paanch alag-alag taan main rote the
 According to the third story, when actor Ashok Kumar saw him, he was repeatedly reciting the word 'pa', hence his name was Pancham
 pancham daaki shuruaati padhai kolkata ke saint jevirs skool main hui
 At the age of just 9, RD performed his first song 'aye Meri Topi Palat Ke Aa', which his father used in the 1956 film 'funtosh'
 ‘sar jo tera chakraaye’ kii dhun bhi arady ne hi apane bachapan main taiyaar kii thi, jise unke pita ne 1957 main guru dutt kii film ‘pyaasa’ main prayog kiya
 In Mumbai, Pancham Daco Ustad Ali Akbar Khan gave tabla training to Sarod and Samta Prasad
 ve sall choudhary ko bhi apana guru maanate the
 He also played harmonica and mouth organ in the orchestra with his father
 kai filmein main ve pita ke saath sahaayak sangeetkaar bhi rahe
 rd's first release as a musician was 'chote Nawab' from the 1961 debut production of the comedian Mahmood
 ek sangeetkaar ke taur par unki pehali hit film 1966 main ‘teesri manzil’ rahi
 Pleased with the hit music of the film, producer and writer Nasir Hussain signed 6 more films with Pancham Da and lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri
 ek taraf unke sangeet kii tarif ho rahi thi to duusari taraf pancham da apane pita ke saath sahaayak ke taur par bhi kaam jari rakhe hue the
 It is also said that the super hit song 'mere Sapne Ki Rani' from Kishore Kumar's film 'aradhana' was actually the tune of Pancham Da, although the music of the film was given by his father SD Burman
 1970 ke dashak mempancham da khub hitahue
 Kishore Kumar's voice, Rajesh Khanna's acting and Pancham Da's music won a lot of accolades in this decade
 1970 main kati patang ke superhit sangeet se yah jodi shuru hui or phir rukne kaa naam nahin liya
 In the 70s Pancham da composed music for Dev Anand's film Hare Rama Hare Krishna and Asha Bhosle sang the song 'dum Maro Dum', which was a tremendous hit
 yah gaanaa film par baari na pad jaae isi dar se dev anand ne puraa gaanaa film main nahin rakhaa
 After this also in 1971, RD gave many tremendous hit songs
 1972 main ‘sita or gita', ‘rampur kaa lakshmana’, ‘bombe tu goa’, ‘apana desh’, ‘parichay’ jaisi filmon main hit sangeet diya

 gayak kumaar shanu ko pancham da ne hi pehla brake diya yahi nahin gayak abhijit ko bhi arady ne hi bada brake diya
 Hariharan also got identified with RD for the first time
 mohammad ajij ne bhi pancham da ke saath hi 1985 main pehla gaanaa gaaya

 yah vishuddh sanyog he ki 15 saal pehle india today ne sex par apana pehla surveykshan prakashit kiya tha or britain se bharat aakar ek manochikitsak ke rup main kaam karte hue mujhe bhi itane hi saal ho gaye
 Surveys involve highly confidential and private conversations with people to get a broad view of social trends
 iske vipareet apane marijon ke saath meri baatcheet behad vyaktigat, antarang hoti he or unki dharanaen gaharaai tak dhansi hui hoti hai
 Talking about sex is not easy, but perhaps relying on secrecy and secrecy, people hesitantly disclose their intimate talks, their dilemmas, fears and fears
 mere upar bharosa karke logon ne mujhase jo baatcheet kii, vah beete varshon main badalati saamaajik manyataon or mulyon kii kahani he
 The biggest difference between then and now is that women are now openly talking about their sexuality and their unquenchable desires
 maine 15 saal pehle bharat main jab kaam karnaa shuru kiya tha to aisa nahin tha
 Now i meet many women who have no inkling of admitting that they are not satisfied with their partner in terms of sex or their extramarital affairs, because they are not satisfied with their sex with husbands
 ve mere paas yah poochne ke liye aati hai ki ve sahi hai yaa nahin
 The conversation that used to be extremely difficult 15 years from now, is now openly with great ease
 iske ulat, main bahut aise yuva danpatiyon se bhi miltaa hum jo sex-viheen vivaah main pratyaksh rup se kaaphi santusht hai
 Most of them loved each other before marriage and their marriage had been 5 to 15 years
 ve ek-duusare ke saath bilkul khush hai, paariwarik jivan acchhee tarah se vyateet kar rahe hai, lekin kaam ke boj or paariwarik jaruraton ko puraa karne main vyast hone ke kaaran sex ke prati unamem na to zyada ruchi he, na hi urja
 Perhaps the reason is that his focus is too much on career
 kaam kaa boj unki sex kii takat ko chusata ja rahaa he or sex ke liye unke paas samay or urja kaa abhaav he
 Talking about sexual harassment and bullying is no longer as embarrassing as it was before
 pink jaisi filmein or dil dahala dene vaale nirbhaya cond ke baad hue andolan ne is masale par baat ko sahaj banane main mukhya bhoomika nibhaai he
 This has changed our thinking and now a woman victim of sexual harassment is not considered guilty
 pichley 15 varshon main langik vividhta ke bare main bhi logon kii soch badali he
 Relying on me, male gays, lesbians, eunuchs, etc
, have spoken openly about their interests, interests, frustration and problems regarding sex
 durbhaagya se hamaara samaaj aaj bhi aise logon ko bare main rudh or paakhandee bana hua he
 We as a society have not changed yet, but at least media coverage and fearless organizations representing minorities in terms of sex have given them a voice
 ab ve band daravaajon se baahar aa rahe hai or apane jaison ke bich ekajutata kaa anubhav kar rahe hai
 Networking on social media has made a qualitative difference in his life
 soshal media par mitrataa karne se unki vaastavik jindagi main bada badlaav aayaa he, jo us vakt acolpaneey tha, jab india today ne sex par apana pehla surveykshan kiya tha
 Now i have many eunuch children and young people bring their parents, even grandparents, and consult with me how to accept their new identity
 17 saal ke ek yuva (jo sharir se purush he) ne ek baar ichha jaahir kii ki vah ek shaadi main ghaghara-cholii pahananaa chahta he, jise uski daadi ne saaf-saaf manaa kar diya, lekin unhone use halki lipistic lagane kii ijaajat jarur de di
 Social media and smartphones have had the biggest impact on our sex life
 kaamuk chitron or video kaa aadan-pradaan aam baat ho gai he
 When i asked a girl that she was not afraid to send her masturbation video to her boyfriend? His answer was that he hid his face while making the video
 lekin, ashleel drishyon ke jariye kisi ko pareshaan karne kii ghatnaayen bhi bad gai hai
 Now i also have people who are very upset and want to commit suicide, because intimate scenes of sex are being run on the internet
 baharhaal, maine in 15 varshon main sabase bada badlaav yah dekha he ki saathi kii vafadari ke bare main najariya kaaphi badla he
 My office in Kolkata is very close to the software center
 main aksar hi kollcenter yaa ity companiyon main kaam karne vaale yuvak-yuvatiyon se miltaa rahata hum
 Most of these boys and girls live alone away from the eyes of family and parents
 unke bich jis tarah se aakasmik sex, rangareliyaan or ''matlab kii yaari" chalati rahati he, vah shobhaa de jaisi lekhikaon ke liye acchhee saamagree ho sakati he
 i have realized that young and urban Indians have now moved beyond the idea of "sex only after marriage"
 haalanki sex main is svachhndatha kii keemat bhi chukaani padati he
 Often, young people are confused and sometimes have to face problems due to their ignorance
 ant main, agar mujhe 15 saal baad dobaaraa badlaavon ke bare main likhane kaa avasar mila to main unke bare main bataanaa chaahunga
 Now sex education has become very important, so that the younger generation can understand it properly and can avoid the expense of sexual harassment and ignorance of the freedom of sex
 ham ise bade str par lagu karne kaa intjaar nahin kar sakate
 It has become necessary to accept the diversity of sex and to change conservative gender thinking
 ham ab is tarah ke soch kii andekhi nahin kar sakate
 It is expected that in the next 15 years, we will break many of these taboo and move forward

 In this match, Bangalore won the toss and decided to bat first
 ipel ke duusare satr kaa yah 24waan match tha
 In this match, Kaptani of Royal Challengers Bangalore was handled by Anil Kumble
 unki team ko vipakshi team ke captain yuvaraj singh bhi acchhee takkar di
 However, the competition between the two teams was very exciting
 mathura main jawahar baag kii ghatana main espi or inspector samet do darjan se zyada logon kii maut ne uttar pradesh kii akhilesh sarkaar ko katghare main khadaa kar diya
 After that, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav was looking for a young officer who would work administratively in the right way to handle this stressful environment
 maamla rajnatik tool pakad chukaa he, isliye tatkaal rajya ke police mahanideshak javed ahamed or grih sachiv ne chaar adhikariyon ko short list kiya
 But among all the four officers, the administrative efficiency of Babloo Kumar, a 2009 batch young IPS officer, attracted everyone
 akhilesh ko pasand bablu kumaar kii shaileisse pehle jalon main bataur espi bablu kumaar ne sthaneey netagiri par jamkar nakel kasi thi
 At the same time, when Shahjahanpur was burning in the alleged murder of journalist Jagendra Singh, Bablu Kumar was assigned the responsibility of the district
 lekin panchayat chunaav ke dauraan unhone ek party vishesh ke netaa kii madad nahin kii to unka tabadalaa kar lakhanu police hadquarter se jod diya gaya
 But according to sources, young Chief Minister Akhilesh was pleased with the working style of Bablu Kumar and on his instruction, he was made SP of Jalaun after a few days
 mafiaon kii nikaali hawsub jab upi kii akhilesh sarkaar musiibat main ghiri he to ek baar phir is yuva adhikari par vishwaas jataayaa gaya he
 Bablu Kumar was airlifted by helicopter and taken directly to Mathura from Jalaun
 jalon se achaanak unke tabadale ko lekar bhi sawaal uth rahe he, kyonki jalon main unke rahete hue bhrasht raajnneetijna or mafia khud ko viklang mahasoos karne lage the
 Here Bablu was getting a lot of accolades for removing fake red lights and hooters on the vehicles of SP leaders
 isse pehle bablu estf main bhi bataur espi kaam kar chuke hai
 The characteristic of Babloo with tall saddle and short hair style is that they do not fit in any kind of administrative posting based on the castes of UP
 sirf apane man kii karte hai bablupolice mahakme or sapa ke kuch sheersh ranneetikaar bablu kumaar kii tainaati ke paksh main nahin the, lekin dijipi or grih sachiv ne maujuuda halaat se nipatane main bablu kumaar ko sabase sakasham bataaya or mukhyamantri ne bhi apane anubhav ke aadhaar par chaar adhikariyon kii suchi main se bablu kumaar ko praathamikta di
 Bablu's image is that of an impartial and honest officer and one of his biggest characteristics is that he listens to everyone, but does not listen to everyone
 bahut baar hua bablu kumaar kaa tabadalaayani kisi bhi rajnatik dabaav main unhen kaam karne kii aadat hi nahin he, yahi vajah he ki unka tabadalaa bahut jald hota rahata he
 This is the reason that at such a young age, in a big state like UP, his devotion has got an identity and he is being trusted in the hour of crisis
 uski sabase badi vajah he- unki kaaryastylee
 The working style of Bablu Kumar has been to work on the basis of concrete facts while remaining in the administrative realm
 isliye bablu kumaar kii kaabiliyat or kaaryakshmata ko prashasnic tantra ke saath-saath rajaneta bhi maanane lage hai
 a few days after reminding Pakistan of its promise to bring the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack to justice, a senior US official has said that his country had led the lashkar-e-taiba operations commander in the 2008 Mumbai attack
 Zakir Rahman shared 'strong evidence' about Pakistan's involvement with Lakhvi
 ek varisht america adhikari ne pahchaan ujagar na karne kii shart par kaha, 'america ne pakistan ko (lakhvi ke bare main) vishwasaneey saboot die hai
 The officer refused to give detailed information in this regard, saying that it was a legal matter
 unhone bataaya ki america ne lakhvi or mumbai aatanki hamale main shaamil anya logon ke bare main pakistan ko jo soochna di he vah vishwasaneey he
 The information that the US has provided about those involved in the Mumbai terror attack is based on an interrogation of David Headley
 hedli mumbai hamale main sanliptata ke jurm main jail kii sajaa kaat rahaa he
 US security agencies and intelligence units have investigated the Mumbai terror attack
 america sarkaar ke ek adhikari ne kaha, 'ab tak nyaay vibhaag evam sangheey jaanch beuro ne mumbai hamale kii jaanch main kaaphi madad kii or baari maatra main saboot ikattha karne main sahyog kiya
 ' america adhikari ne kaha, 'jaisaa raashtrapati obama ne kaha ki mumbai (hamale) ko anjaam dene waalon, uske liye dhan pradaan karne waalon or praayojakon ko unke aparaadhon ke liye javabdeh tehraaya jaae, ham sabhi sarkaron se aisa karne kaa aahvaan karte hai
 ' is soochna ke aane se ek saptaah pehle america ne kaha tha ki pakistan ke saath aatankwaad se nipatane ke liye majboot saajhedaari he
 The US then appealed to Islamabad to fulfill its promise to bring the perpetrators of the 26 / 11 attacks to justice
 america videsh vibhaag kii pravaktaa jine saki ne kaha tha, 'pakistan sarkaar ne mumbai hamalon ko anjaam dene waalon or unhen vittiya madad dene waalon ko nyaay ke katghare main laane main sahyog karne kaa vaada kiya tha
 We appeal to Pakistan to fulfill that promise
 ' Fifty-five-year-old Lakhvi is the alleged mastermind of the Mumbai attacks and is currently lodged in a Pakistani jail under the Public Security System
 pichley saptaah ek adaalat ne lakhvi ko jail se reeha karne ke nirdesh die the
 India had strongly opposed this move
 lakhvi ko is aadesh par amal se pehle hi pichley saptaah phir hiraasat main le liya gaya tha
 Jaya Prada has reacted strongly to the statement made by Anarkali of Abdullah Azam Khan, son of Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Azam Khan
 jaya pradaa ne kaha ki 'jaisaa pita vaisaa betaa or rampur kii janata iskaa karaara jawaab degi
 'abdullah Azam had spoken Anarkali at a public meeting on Sunday without naming Jaya Prada, to which his response has come on Monday
 jaya pradaa rampur se bijepi kii pratyaashee hai
 In recent times, SP leader Azam Khan has made quite controversial statements against him, on which the Election Commission has also taken action
 unke chunaav prachaar par 72 ghante kii roak lagaai gai thi
 Abdullah Azam, who came in favor of his father, strongly criticized the Election Commission on this ban and described it as an action taken at the behest of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 ravivaar ko ek jansabha main abdulla ajam ne jaya pradaa par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Without naming Jaya Prada, she called him Anarkali
 abdulla ajam ke is vivaadit bayaan par somvaar ko jaya pradaa ne palatwaar kiya or kaha ki 'jaisaa papa he vaisaa betaa he
 The father says the same
 mujhe laga abdulla padhe likhe hai, lekin ve bhi usee parivaar se hai
 They do not know how to value women
 ' jaya pradaa ne aage kaha, 'log sab kuch dekh rahe hai
 This statement is not about Jaya Prada, she (azam Khan) has treated the women of the country like Anarkali
 ve is desh kii mahilaon ko naachne vaali samajhate hai
 The women of India will give a befitting reply to the father-son duo, which will close their mouths
 ''eks-re jaisi ankhen' par ghirin jaya pradadusri taraf jaya pradaa par bispi pramukh mayawati ke khilaaf kathith rup se amaryadit tippanee karne kaa aarope laga he
 Jaya Prada has said that 'he (azam Khan) has also insulted Mayawati in the guest house scandal
 unhen kya pataa aaj ke aadhunik jamaane ke bare main, kya pataa uske glass main eks-re vijan laga ho
 Though Jaya Prada later clarified this and said that she was not commenting on Mayawati, her motive was just to bring up the issue
 mayawati ko lekar is kathith tippanee par jaya pradaa ke khilaaf gaiyr-sangyeya aparaadh soochna report bhi darj karai gai he
 The troubles of Azam Khan's son Abdullah Azam Khan have increased due to the bad words of Azam's son 'anarkali'
 rampur ke jiladhikari anjanay kumaar ke mutabik jaya pradaa ko anaarakali kehane par unke khilaaf gaiyr-sangyeya aparaadh report darj karne kii taiyaari he
 The Rampur Returning Officer has taken cognizance of the statement of Abdullah Azam Khan
 rampur nirvachan adhikari ne abdulla ajam khan ke vivaadaaspad bayaan kii report uttar pradesh ke mukhya nirvachan adhikari ko bheji he
 The Rampur Returning Officer has also sent footage of Abdullah Azam Khan's statement in his report
 darasal sapa netaa ajam khan ke bete abdulla ajam khan ne bijepi pratyaashee jaya pradaa par bina naam liye nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 Significantly, Jaya Prada has recently joined BJP
 bijepi main aane ke baad party ne unhen rampur loksabhaa seat se chunaav ladaane kaa faisla kiya
 He represented Rampur in the 2009 and 2014 elections
 donon baar unhone rampur se congress kii nur bano ko shikast di thi

 upi chunaav ke nattejey aane ke baad se hi aarope-pratyarope kaa daur bhi shuru ho gaya he
 The BSP supremo Samayawati has clearly stated in a press conference that the results are beyond her comprehension and evms have been tampered with
 soshal media par bhi ye joke pehle hi viral ho rahaa tha ki iviem main koi bhi batan dabaao bijepi ko hi vot jaataa he
 The question is, is it possible to tamper with evms? Before finding the answer to this question, it is important to know how EVM works
 iviem yani electronic voting mashin main ek control unit hoti he
 a ballot unit and a 5 meter cable
 ye mashin 6 volt kii bydaree se bhi chalaai ja sakati he
 The voter has to press the button next to the candidate of his choice and the machine is locked as soon as a vote is taken
 iske baad sirf nae bailat number se hi khulti he
 Only 5 votes can be cast in an EVM in a minute
 iviem mashine bailat box se zyada aasaan thim, unki storage, gananaa aadi sab kuch zyada behatar tha isliye inkaa istemaal shuru hua
 It has been a part of Indian elections for almost 15 years
 lekin iviem mashine kaaphi asurakshit bhi hoti hai

 (@thecricprof)april 8, 2016 Manohar Parrikar has resigned as the Minister of Defense after being named the Chief Minister of Goa
 unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi ko apana istipha saunpa
 The PMO sent his resignation to the President for approval
 raashtrapati kii is par muhar ke baad vitt mantri arun jetali ko raksha mantralay kaa atirikt prabhaar de diya gaya he
 It is worth mentioning that Jaitley earlier had the charge of this ministry earlier but later, Manohar Parrikar left this charge after becoming the Minister of Defense
 isse pehle goa vidhansabha chunaav ke baad teji se badale siyaasi ghatnakram main raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne raksha mantri ke pad se istipha de diya
 Now he will take oath as Goa's Chief Minister once again at 5 pm on 14 March
 bijepi ko samarthan dene vaali emjeepi ke netaa sudhir dhavlikar ko upmukhyamantri banaaya jayega
 In fact, earlier Goa Governor Mridula Sinha invited BJP leader and Union Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar to form the government
 parrikar ne ravivaar ko hi rajyapal se mulaakaat kar sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya tha
 The Governor has asked Parrikar to prove his majority within 15 days after his swearing in
 gauratlab he ki pehle media main aisi khabaren ai ki parrikar ne rakshaamantri ke pad se istipha de diya he lekin baad main nitin gadakari ne sthiti spasht karte hue bataaya tha ki shapath grahan kii taarikh tay hone ke baad hi parrikar rakshaamantri kaa pad chodenge
 Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said that the MGP and the Goa Forward told him that if Manohar Parrikar became the Chief Minister, he was ready to give support
 maine party adhyaksh amit shah ke samaksh goa ke vidhayakon kii baat rakhi
 He held discussions with Prime Minister Modi and the Parliamentary Board
 is puure ghatnakram ko lekar parrikar ne kaha ki party jo bhi faisla karegi, vah unhen maanya hoga or agar goa main unki jarurat he to vah raksha mantri kaa pad chhod denge
 Gadkari said that the party president and the parliamentary board had given me the right to take appropriate decisions
 jab main 21 vidhayakon ke samarthan ke prati aashwast ho gaya tab rajyapal se mulaakaat kar sarkaar banane daawa pesh kiya gaya
 The decision to make Parrikar as Chief Minister was approved in the meeting of newly elected Goa mlas on Sunday evening
 parrikar ne rajyapal se mulaakaat kar goa main sarkaar banane kaa daawa bhi pesh kiya he
 Parrikar has claimed the support of 21 mlas
 vidhayakon ke samarthan kaa patr lekar kendriya parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ke saath parrikar rajbhavan pahunche
 Significantly, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), which was ready to support the BJP, had put a condition that if Manohar Parrikar will be made the Chief Minister of Goa, then only he will give support
 MGP ke netaa sudhir dhavlikar ne mediakarmiyon se baatcheet main kaha tha ki ve bijepi ko satta main laane ke liye tabhi samarthan de sakate hai jab rakshaamantri manohar parrikar ko goa ke mukhyamantri pad kii jimmedaari di jaae
 The MGP has 3 elected mlas
 dhavlikar goa main mediakarmiyon se baat kar rahe the
 He made his point clear by writing a letter to BJP President Amit Shah
 goa main bijepi ko satta main laane ke liye 9 vidhayakon kii jarurat he
 In such a situation, denying the support of its old ally MGP would mean that the BJP gets away from the race for power
 dhavlikar ke manohar parrikar or bijepi se barkaraar rishton main khatas tab aayi jab lakshmikant parsekar ko goa kaa mukhyamantri banaaya gaya
 The MGP withdrew support to the BJP government after Parsekar's statement against MGP ministers
 iske baad MGP ne shivasena or goa suraksha manch ke saath gathjod kar bijepi ko chunauti di
 This alliance has won only 3 seats
 unke samarthan se bijepi 13 se 16 tak to pahunch jaaegi
 Apart from MGP, the Goa forward is also positive about Manohar Parrikar's leadership
 is gut ke paas bhi 3 vidhayakon kaa sankhyabal he
 Gut leader Vijay Sardesai told the media in Goa that Parrikar was a better person than the Congress
 congress ne goa forward ke ummidavaaron ko pratadit kiya he
 In such a situation, how will it be possible to support the Congress? With the support of Goa Forward too, BJP will get closer to majority and it can have the support of 19 mlas
 tippaniyan There are now 3 independent mlas in Goa
 inamen rohan khanvate, govind gaavade or prasad gaanvkar shaamil hai
 Everyone's eyes are on his attitude
 inamen se seve goa front ke prasad gaanvkar ko bijepi ne samarthan de kar chunaav main utaara he or jisase bijepi gathbandhan kaa aankada 20 tak pahunch rahaa he
 While the remaining 2 independents, the Congress has placed its bet on Rohan Khawante
 goa prabharee or varisht congress netaa digvijay singh ne samvaadadaata sammelan kar kaha ki rohan khanvate kii congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi se mulaaqaat ho chuki he or ve congress ke saath rahenge
 However, despite the support of Rohan Khawante and ncp's 1-1 MLA, the Congress alliance is lagging behind the MLA 1
 in paristhitiyon main siem banane ja rahe manohar parrikar ko 6 maheene ke bheetar goa vidhansabha kaa sadsy bananaa hoga
 For which the resignation of the current MLA is necessary

 darasal isse pehle goa kii rajyapal mridula sinha ne bhaajapa netaa or kendriya raksha mantri manohar parrikar ko sarkaar banane kaa nyotaa diya
 Parrikar met the Governor on Sunday and claimed to form the government
 rajyapal ne shapath grahan ke baad 15 dinon ke bheetar parrikar ko bahumat sabit karne ko kaha he
 It is worth mentioning that earlier there were reports in the media that Parrikar had resigned as the defense minister, but later Nitin Gadkari explained the situation and said that Parrikar will leave the post of defense minister only after the date of the swearing-in date is fixed
 kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ne bataaya ki emjeepi or goa forward ne unase kaha ki agar manohar parrikar mukhyamantri bane to wo samarthan dene ko taiyaar hai
 i presented the Goa mlas before the party president Amit Shah
 unhone pradhanmantri modi or sansadeey board se charchaa kii
 On this whole incident, Parrikar said that whatever decision the party will make, it will be valid and if he is needed in Goa, he will leave the post of Defense Minister
 gadakari ne kaha ki party adhyaksh or sansadeey board ne mujhe uchit nirnay lene kaa adhikaar diya tha
 When i was convinced of the support of 21 mlas, then i met the Governor and made a claim to form the government
 ravivaar shaam goa ke navnirvaachit vidhayakon kii baithak main parrikar ko mukhyamantri banane ke faisle par muhar lagi
 Parrikar has also met the Governor and submitted a claim to form the government in Goa
 parrikar ne 21 vidhayakon ke samarthan kaa daawa kiya he
 Parrikar along with Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari reached the Raj Bhavan with a letter of support from the mlas
 gauratlab he ki bijepi ko samarthan dene ke liye taiyaar maharashtravaadi gomantak party (MGP) ne shart rakhi thi ki agar manohar parrikar ko goa kaa mukhyamantri banaaya jayega tabhi wo samarthan degi
 MGP leader Sudhir Dhavalikar had told media persons that he can only support the BJP to bring it to power if Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar is given the responsibility of the post of Chief Minister of Goa
 MGP ke 3 vidhayak chunakar aae hai
 Dhavalikar was talking to media persons in Goa
 unhone bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko khat likhakar apni baat spasht kar di thi
 9 mlas are needed to bring BJP to power in Goa
 aise main apane puraane sahyogi MGP kaa miltaa samarthan nakaarne kaa matlab hoga ki bijepi satta kii daud se dur ho jaae
 The tense relationship between Dhavalikar's Manohar Parrikar and the BJP came when Laxmikant Parsekar was made the Chief Minister of Goa
 parsekar dwaara MGP ke mantriyon ke kilaaf die bayaan ke baad MGP ne BJP sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya tha
 After this, the MGP in alliance with Shiv Sena and Goa Suraksha Manch challenged the BJP
 is gathbandhan kii 3 seat par hi jeet hui he
 With his support, BJP will reach from 13 to 16
 MGP ke alaava goa forward bhi manohar parrikar ke netritv ko lekar sakaaratmak he
 This group also has a strength of 3 mlas
 gut ke netaa vijay saradesai ne goa main media se baatcheet main kaha ki congress ke mukaable parrikar achche vyakti hai
 The Congress has harassed Goa Forward candidates
 aise main congress ko samarthan dena kaise mumkin hoga? goa forward ke bhi samarthan se bijepi bahumat ke or kareeb pahunch jaaegi or uske paas 19 vidhayakon kaa samarthan ho saktaa he
 The comments goa main ab 3 nirdaleey vidhayak hai
 These include Rohan Khawante, Govind Gavade and Prasad Gaonkar
 inke rukh par sabaki nazren tiki hai
 Of these, BJP has fielded Prasad Gaonkar of Save Goa Front in the election and the BJP alliance's figure is reaching 20
 jabaki baaki bache 2 nirdaleeyon main se rohan khanvate par congress ne apana daanv lagaaya he
 Goa in-charge and senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh held a press conference and said that Rohan Khawante has met Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi and will be with Congress
 haalanki, rohan khanvate or ensipi ke 1-1 vidhayak ke samarthan ke baad bhi bijepi gathbandhan ke mukaable congress gathbandhan 1 vidhayak peeche he
 Manohar Parrikar, who is going to become CM under these circumstances, will have to be made a member of the Goa Legislative Assembly within 6 months
 jiske liye vartmaan vidhayak kaa istifa jaruri he

 jab main 21 vidhayakon ke samarthan ke prati aashwast ho gaya tab rajyapal se mulaakaat kar sarkaar banane daawa pesh kiya gaya
 The decision to make Parrikar as Chief Minister was approved in the meeting of newly elected Goa mlas on Sunday evening
 parrikar ne rajyapal se mulaakaat kar goa main sarkaar banane kaa daawa bhi pesh kiya he
 Parrikar has claimed the support of 21 mlas
 vidhayakon ke samarthan kaa patr lekar kendriya parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ke saath parrikar rajbhavan pahunche
 Significantly, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), which was ready to support the BJP, had put a condition that if Manohar Parrikar will be made the Chief Minister of Goa, then only he will give support
 MGP ke netaa sudhir dhavlikar ne mediakarmiyon se baatcheet main kaha tha ki ve bijepi ko satta main laane ke liye tabhi samarthan de sakate hai jab rakshaamantri manohar parrikar ko goa ke mukhyamantri pad kii jimmedaari di jaae
 The MGP has 3 elected mlas
 dhavlikar goa main mediakarmiyon se baat kar rahe the
 He made his point clear by writing a letter to BJP President Amit Shah
 goa main bijepi ko satta main laane ke liye 9 vidhayakon kii jarurat he
 In such a situation, denying the support of its old ally MGP would mean that the BJP gets away from the race for power
 dhavlikar ke manohar parrikar or bijepi se barkaraar rishton main khatas tab aayi jab lakshmikant parsekar ko goa kaa mukhyamantri banaaya gaya
 The MGP withdrew support to the BJP government after Parsekar's statement against MGP ministers
 iske baad MGP ne shivasena or goa suraksha manch ke saath gathjod kar bijepi ko chunauti di
 This alliance has won only 3 seats
 unke samarthan se bijepi 13 se 16 tak to pahunch jaaegi
 Apart from MGP, the Goa forward is also positive about Manohar Parrikar's leadership
 is gut ke paas bhi 3 vidhayakon kaa sankhyabal he
 Gut leader Vijay Sardesai told the media in Goa that Parrikar was a better person than the Congress
