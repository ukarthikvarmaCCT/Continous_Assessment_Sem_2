 However, he has said so far that all these rumors are there and he will contest the election on the cycle of sp's election trail
 darasal sapa kii kaman akhilesh yadav ke haathon main puri tarah se aane ke baad shivpal yadav party main ekadam haashie par pahunch gaye hai
 In fact, when he was the state president of the party, he along with Mulayam Singh released the list of candidates in December
 uske baad party main jabardast ghamaasan ke baad antim rup se jab kaman akhilesh ko mili to unhone us suchi ko khaarij kar diya or apni nai suchi jari kii
 After this, Akhilesh gave tickets to his supporters by cutting the tickets of Shivpal and Mulayam supporters
 pita-putr main sulah hone ke baad mulaayam ne apane 38 samarthakon kii suchi akhilesh kaa di thi
 Akhilesh did not give tickets to some of them
 mulaayam ne jab pehali baar ye 38 naam die the tab usamen shivpal kaa naam nahin tha or unki jagah bete aditya kaa naam tha
 Shivpal's name was later added to it
 shivpal yadav itawa kii jaswantnagar seat se chunaav ladate rahe hai
 However, even after the formation of sp-congress alliance, the political picture has changed
 mulaayam ne is gathbandhan kaa khuletaur par virodh karte hue kaha he ki vah iske samarthan main chunaav prachaar nahin karenge
 The Mulayam camp believes that this will harm their supporters and party workers will not be able to contest the seats given to the Congress
 unhone apane samarthakon or akhilesh ke baagiyon se bhi kaha he ki vah congress kii siton par nirdaleey pratyaashee ke rup main utren or vah unka samarthan karenge
 Shivpal's displeasure is also linked to this announcement of Mulayam
 isaki vajah yah he ki shivpal ne yah kaha bhi he ki unke samarthak yadi unako prachaar ke liye bulaayenge to vah unka prachaar karne jaaenge
 It is clear that many supporters of mulayam-shivpal who have left the party due to their displeasure with Akhilesh will go to Shivpal to promote them
 ullekhneey he ki kuch samay pehle sapa main yadav parivaar ke bich main jabardast ghamaasan machaa tha
 During that time the party was torn in two
 ek taraf mulaayam singh yadav or shivpal yadav the to duusari taraf akhilesh yadav or ramgopal the
 It culminated in a coup in SP
 akhilesh yadav ko party kaa rashtriya adhyaksh bana diya gaya
 Shivpal Yadav was removed from the post of state president of the party
 chunaav nishaan par kabje kii ladaai kaa maamla chunaav ayog ke paas pahunchaa
 After the Election Commission gave its verdict in favor of Akhilesh, he got legal recognition from one side
 tippaniyan In fact, Shivpal Yadav has become marginalized in the party after SP command Akhilesh Yadav came fully into the hands
 darasal jab vah party ke pradesh adhyaksh the to unhone mulaayam singh ke saath milakar disambar main pratyaashiyon kii suchi jari kii thi
 After that, when Akhilesh finally got the command after the fierce fighting in the party, he rejected that list and released his new list
 uske baad shivpal or mulaayam samarthakon ke tikat katkar akhilesh ne apane samarthakon ko tikat die
 After reconciliation between father and son, Mulayam gave a list of 38 of his supporters to Akhilesh
 akhilesh ne usamen se bhi kuch logon ko tikat nahin diya
 When Mulayam gave these 38 names for the first time, Shivpal did not have a name in it and his son Aditya was replaced
 baad main shivpal kaa naam usamen joda gaya
 Shivpal Yadav is contesting from Jaswantnagar seat of Etawah
 haalanki ab sapa-congress gathbandhan hone ke baad bhi siyaasi tasviir badal gai he
 Mulayam has openly opposed this alliance, saying that he will not campaign in support of it
 mulaayam kheme kaa maananaa he ki isse unke samarthakon kaa nuksaan hoga or party kaaryakarta congress ko di gai siton par chunaav nahin lard paaenge
 He has also told his supporters and the rebels of Akhilesh that he will contest the Congress seats as an independent candidate and he will support him
 shivpal kii naaraazgi ko mulaayam kii is ghoshnaa se bhi jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 The reason for this is that Shivpal has also said that if his supporters call him for campaigning, he will go to promote them
 yani saaf he ki mulaayam-shivpal ke kai samarthakon jinhone akhilesh se naaraazgi ke chalate party chodi he, unka prachaar karne shivpal jaaenge
 It is worth mentioning that some time ago there was a lot of fierce fighting in the SP among the Yadav family
 us dauraan party main do faad ho gaya tha
 On one side were Mulayam Singh Yadav and Shivpal Yadav and on the other side there were Akhilesh Yadav and Ram Gopal
 uski parinti sapa main takhtapalat ke rup main hui
 Akhilesh Yadav was made the national president of the party
 shivpal yadav ko party ke pradesh adhyaksh pad se hataa diya gaya
 The matter of occupation on the election trail reached the Election Commission

 After Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar openly and fiercely attacked the prominent leader of the ally BJP and Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, there are clear signs that there has been a big rift in both the parties and in October this year In the Bihar assembly elections, the two parties will follow different paths
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar dwaara modi ke vigyapanon par nishaanaa banaae jane or bhaajapa rashtriya kaaryakarini ke pratinidhiyon ke liye raatri bhoj ko radd karne ke baad bhaajapa ke netaaon ne anaupchaarik baatcheet main sweekaar kiya ‘‘ham ladaai haar chuke hai or saath milakar chunaav ladane ke raste band ho chuke hai
 Senior BJP leaders, on the condition of anonymity, said that the extent to which Nitish is reacting against the BJP by making advertisements of Modi's advertisements is clear that his intentions are different
 unhone nitish par vivekhinta kii had tak chale jane kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki bihar ke mukhyamantri atiaatmavishvaas kaa shikaar ho chuke hai or ve is galatfahami main hai ki bhaajapa ke bina chunaav jeet sakate hai or iske liye vah yah dussahas dikhaa rahe hai
 These leaders say that Nitish is also in the misconception that targeting Modi will force his electorate to cross the BJP without the BJP on the strength of about 16 per cent Muslim voters in the state
 unhan yah bhi khushrahmi he ki mahilaon ko sthaneey nikaay or panchayaton main 50 fisadi aarakshan dekar or anusuchit jati main shaamil 23 jatiyon ko mahadaliton kii jamaat main shaamil karke unhone bahut bada tir maar liya he or ab modi ko nishaanaa banaakar musalamaanon, mahilaon or mahadaliton ke bal par tathaa bhaajapa ke bina vah aktubar tak hone ja rahe chunaav main jitkar phir se satta main aa jaaenge
 Sources in the BJP also indicated that the announcement of choosing a different path between the two parties has remained a mere formality and that the two will be divorced during the bjp's two-day national executive meeting starting today or a few days after that
 Announcement may occur

 Right now people in many areas of the country including Chennai are troubled by the water crisis
 dhire-dhire iskaa dayera or badhata jayega or har ore yah sankat dikhne lagegaa
 Consistent water conservation is being talked about to avoid the water crisis, but the way things are happening in this regard, it seems that this necessary campaign is still a ritual
 haalanki dilli jal board ne barish ke jal kaa sangrakshan nahin karne ke kaaran apane hi upabhoktaaon par 48 karod rupee kaa jurmaana laga diya he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently said that only 8 per cent of rain water is used and harvested properly
 is tarah se dekha jaae to 90 fisadi se zyada barish kaa pani bah jaataa he or iskaa sahi tareeke se istemaal nahin hota, lekin desh main jis tarah se jal sankat he uske lihaaj se varsha jal sangrakshan behad jaruri ho jaataa he
 The country is once again rainy season and due to continuous rains many cities are full of water but they are not being stored
 khaas baat yah he ki graminon kii tulana main shahari kshetra ke log zyada pani barbaad karte hai or sangrakshan ke maamle main shahari log phiseddi bhi hai
 Experts associated with water conservation believe that this should be done fast and rain water conservation should be increased to 15 percent
 niti ayog kii report kahati he 2030 tak bharat kii 40 fisadi aabaadi ke paas pine kii pani uplabdhta nahin hoga or unhen khaasaa sangharsh karnaa padegaa
 Water crisis in 21 cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad, including 21 big cities, by 2020, the water level will go down drastically
 is kaaran 10 karod log jal sankat kaa saamana kar rahe honge
 After Narendra Modi came to power for the second time, the government is talking loudly about water conservation
 pradhanmantri modi ne loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan kaa vaada puraa karte hue jal sansaadhan or peyajal evam swatchta mantralayon ko milakar 'jal shakti mantralay' banaaya
 The government handed over this important task to Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and made him Union Minister, while Ratan Lal Kataria was made Minister of State
 modi sarkaar 2
 Before the announcement of the first budget of 0, Union Water Power Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat started the 'jal Shakti Abhiyan'
 is abhiyaan ke tahat pani kii kami kaa saamana kar rahe 256 jilon ke 1,592 khandon par 5 binduon par jor diya jayega
 These include water conservation and rainwater harvesting, sanitation of drinking water, renovation of conventional and other water bodies, reuse of water and recharge of structures and watershed development and intensive afforestation
 256 jilon main se sabase zyada rajasthan (29), tamilnadu (27) or telugana (24) rajya ke jile shaamil kiye gaye hai
 Officers up to Additional Secretaries and Joint Secretaries have been engaged for work on these districts
 NRDWP ke fund main 69 fisadi vriddhiek ore gramin kshetron main kisaanon ko sinchai or sahi fasal chunane ke liye jaagruk bhi kiya jayega to duusari ore shahari kshetron main bekaar pani ko audyogic or krishi kshetra ke uddeshy ke liye taiyaar karaayaa jayega
 As part of the campaign being run for 256 districts, the budget has not been allocated in the new budget in any different way, for these funds will have to be raised through various schemes released in rural areas
 modi sarkaar ke duusare kaarykaal ke pehle bajet main vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne neshnal rural drinking water management yani rashtriya gramin peyajal kaarykram (NRDWP) ke liye 9,150
 36 crores has been allocated which is the budget for 2018-19 (5,391
 32 rupee) kii tulana main 69 fisadi zyada he
 It may be that this amount has been increased in view of water scarcity in many big cities of states like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Gujarat and Maharashtra
 vitt mantri ke anusaar, 2024 tak 'har ghar nal, har nal jal' kii yojana ke tahat modi sarkaar kaa lakshya deshbhar main har ghar jal pahunchane kii he
 More than Rs 20 thousand crore has been given for clean drinking water
 inamen se 8245 karod rupee se nadiyon ke vikaas par kharch kiya jayega or iske madhyam se 450 nadiyon ko aapas main joda jayega
 The previous government had set a target of connecting 60 rivers
 haalanki jal sangrakshan kii disha main pichley 70 saalon main koi thos kaam nahin hua, lekin ab is par teji se kaam kiye jane kii jarurat he
 The number of people in the national capital Delhi has been suffering from water crisis for a long time and water harvesting campaign is also being carried out in Delhi on 11,635 people, but the results did not come out as expected
 dilli jal board (DJB) ne logon main iske prati jaagarukta ke liye un 11,635 upabhoktaaon par 48 karod kaa jurmaana lagaaya jinke paas 500 varg meter se zyada kaa bhubhag he, lekin un logon ne apane yahaan rain water harvesting strecchar taiyaar nahin kiya
 In Delhi, the water quality has also been affected by falling groundwater level
 dilli main 13,491 million kusek meter (emsm) pani uplabdh he jisamen 10,238 emsm pani khaaraa he
 Only 3,207 mcm of water is left clean
 pani kii maang badhane ke kaaran dilli main bhoojal dohan lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he, lekin usamen richarge kam ho rahaa he
 Groundwater levels can be increased by storing 175 million cusec meters (MCM) of water due to rain
 pani kii bevajaah kharchabharat ek krishi pradhan desh he or 50 fisadi se zyada log kheti par nirbhar he
 The farmers who produce food grains for the country's 1
25 billion population are largely dependent on rain and the monsoon has been fluctuating in the last few years
 pani kaa sankat gramin kshetron ke saath-saath shahari kshetron main badhata rahaa he
 Rural people do not spend water unnecessarily compared to urban people, while people living in cities talk about rain water harvesting but are not serious about it
 shahari kshetra ke log nahaane (showers ke saath), brush karne, khaanaa banane, bartan dhone, toilet, washing mashin aadi chizon ke jariye rojaanaa ausatan 250 litre ke kareeb pani istemaal karte hai
 There is a need for water for farming, as well as for other works also Barsha water harvesting needs to be done
 sarkaar pichley kuch samay se jal sanchayan par charchaa kar rahi he, aise main sarkari anudaan kaa istemaal karte hue shahari kshetron ke logon ko is par gambhirtha se kaam karnaa chahie or pani kii kami ko dur karne main apana yogadan den

 china ne aakhirkaar apana rang dikhaa diya
 For the fourth time in a row, China became a hindrance in declaring Jaish kingpin Masood Azhar a global terrorist
 'dragon' kaa 'masood prem' yun hi nahin he
 Actually, China has many such interests behind it which are being avoided by defending Masood Azhar
 kootnithik sambandhon main jokhim nahin lenaa chahta chinakootnithik maamalon ke jaankaar maanate hai ki koi bhi raashtra kisi duusare ke sahyog main tab tak khadaa nahin hota jab tak ki usamen uske rashtriya hit shaamil na hon
 a country like China can never do this without great reason, because it does not take any risk in terms of its national security and diplomatic relations
 
 
 
 Pakistan will be declared a terrorism-sponsored nation, experts believe that many big interests of China are hidden behind not allowing Masood Azhar to be declared a global terrorist
 china ye bhi jaanata he ki hafiz said ke baad agar bharat masood ajahar ko bhi sanyukt raashtra kii pratibandhit aatankiyon kii suchi main shaamil karwaane main safal ho gaya to wo pakistan ko aatankwaad pryojit raashtra ghoshit karaane ke kaaphi kareeb pahunch jayega
 In such a situation, western countries including the US will impose various restrictions on Pakistan, which can cause political and economic difficulties for Pakistan
 saath hi inase china par bhi khaas asar padegaa
 In four years, China has invested $ 50 billion, in addition to saving Azhar Azhar in Pakistan, China is trying in every way that Pakistan should not be isolated
 itnaa hi nahin china, rus ko bhi pakistan ke kareeb laane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 In the last four years, China has invested heavily in Pakistan
 isamen 50 arab dollar se banaaya ja rahaa china-pakistan aarthik galiyara yani sipiisi bhi shaamil he
 It is said that China is afraid that if it does not support Masood or does not advocate Pakistan in international forums, then its huge investment will not sink
 masood ke virodh kaa matlab pakistan kaa sahyog na milanachin ko lagata he ki aisa na karne par jaish-e-mohammad jaise gut uske or pakistan sarkaar ke hi khilaaf ho sakate hai
 History says something similar about jaish-e-mohammed
 2002 main jab pakistan sarkaar ne jaish ko bain kiya tha to uske baad tatkaaleen raashtrapati musharraf tak par kai hamale hue the or desh main sthiti sanbhaalani mushkil ho gai thi
 In such a situation, if China supports the international action against Masood Azhar, it will be very difficult for Pakistan to seek or cooperate with China
 masood par bain lag jaataa to alag-thalag pad jaataa pakistangar china kii haa ke baad masood azhar global aatanki ghoshit ho jaataa, to pakistan ko masood ke khilaaf or usase jude sanghathanon par kadi karrwai kerani padati
 Masood Azhar and his organization would have to be completely isolated
 masood azhar ke teror camp or uske madrason ko band karnaa pakistan kii majaburi ban jaataa
 Who is Masood Azharpakistan Masood Azhar was born on 10 July 1968 in Bahawalpur, Punjab, to the home of a headmaster
 masood apane gyaarah bhai bahanon main tisare number par tha
 Was unable to read and write
 jab wo aathvin jamaat main padhata tha tabhi uske walid ke ek dost use karachi ke jamiya ulum ul islamia main padhaane ke liye le gaye
 Instead of attaining high education there, he started reading the book of terror
 1994 main ho gaya tha giraftaaramasood apni zahreeli takreer se aatank or nafrat badhaane kaa master ban chukaa he
 Masood is not an ordinary terrorist
 pakistani sarkaar kii shah, pakistani sena or uski khufia agency iesai kii madad se masood azhar ne hindustan main aatank failaane kii saazish shuru kii
 In 1994, he went into the hands of security forces in Kashmir, but after the Kandhar incident he reached Pakistan again and started plotting against India from there

 Arjun Ram Meghwal, the Dalit face of Rajasthan BJP and Minister of State in the Modi government, came out in defense of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan's statement on the SC-ST Act on Friday
 unhone kaha ki shivaraj singh chouhan ne kuch bhi galat nahin kaha
 People have not read the SC-ST Act
 isliye is tarah kii baaten kar rahe hai
 He said that there is a place written in the SC-ST Act that if condition arises, if necessary, then arrest without investigation
 is act main aisa kahin nahin he ki bina jaanch kii giraftaar kii jaae
 In Madhya Pradesh, the Congress was creating an atmosphere against the BJP
 jaanboojhkar daliton ko bargala rahi he
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan has rightly said that without investigation, there will be no arrest in the SC-ST Act
 police jaanch ho jane se saamaajik samarasata bhi bani rahegi
 Meghwal said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's entire focus is on the interests of Dalits and the poor
 vah apane har bhaashan main or har meeting main kehete hai ki hamen tay karnaa he ki hamaare jitani acchhee yojanaayen hai
 The beneficiaries should get it
 bijepi kaa puraa focus daliton ke kalyaan par he
 Significantly, in Kirajasthan, there are more than 30 percent votes including SC-ST
 jo akele 70 se 80 siton par nirnaayak bhoomika main hai, lekin bijepi ke saamne samasya yah he ki uske paas apana savarna vot he
 BJP feels that its upper caste vote should not be shattered in the SC-ST Act movement
 lihaaja vah savarnon ke saath-saath daliton par dore daal rahi he
 Significantly, in the 2013 assembly elections and 2014 Lok Sabha elections, most of the Dalits voted for the BJP, leaving the Congress
 arjuna ram meghavaal ne jaipur main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke upar guuruuvaar ko rahul gandhi ke die gaye bayaan ke khilaaf press conference kar rahe the
 While giving a press conference at BJP headquarters, Arjun Ram Meghwal said that there is noise in the street, the watchman of the country is a thief, as if listening to the statement, the Congress is nervous and does not want to see a poor man sitting on the post of Prime Minister
 
 meghavaal ne ise gaiyr sansadeey bataate hue kaha ki rahul gandhi ne pradhanmantri pad kii beijjati kii he
 Calling a watchman a thief means the Prime Minister has been called a thief
 kyonki pradhanmantri hi apane aap ko chaukeedaar kehete hai

 haal hi main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne bhartiya arthvyavastha ko china ke saae se baahar nikaalane kii vakaalat karte hue kaha tha ki china se saste aayaat se desh main utpaadit kii ja rahi vastuon kaa bazaar kharaab ho rahaa he
 Therefore, the Union had advised the Central Government to distance itself from China as well as its private sector to stay away from Chinese companies
 ab aresas centre kii endie sarkaar ko suzav de rahaa he ki vah china kii kaarobaari kuritiyon kaa jawaab dene ke saath-saath kailash, himalay or tibet ko china ke changul se chhudaane kii kavayad or tej kare
 Boycott of Chinese products First step Swadeshi Jagran Manch organized a big rally at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi this week to protest against cheap Chinese products being sold in the country
 is raily main aresas se jude kai anya sanghathanon ne bhi hissaa liya
 During the rally, it was said that after seeing the black work of China in Doklam, the Indian government not only needs to reduce the wrath of China from the Indian economy, but also to bring it out of the clutches of Kailash, Himalayas and Tibet
 Exercise should be intensified
 ise bhi padhein: kaam nahin aayega chini pataakhe-ladiyon kaa 'rashtravaadi' bahishkarchin kii asuri shaktiyangauratlab he ki isse pehle bhi india today samooh ko aresas prachaarak ne bayaan diya tha ki china kii asuri shaktiyaan bharat samet puure asia praant par haaavee hai
 The RSS also appealed to all the citizens of the country to take a pledge to recite mantras five times a day to free the entire Asia province from the unrestrained powers of China
 jisamen china main utpaadit vastuon kaa istemaal nahin karnaa or china ke changul se bharat ke ilaakon ko khaali karana bhi shaamil tha
 This is after the rss's rally at the Tibet Policy Ram Lila Maidan, the Swadeshi Jagran Manch has given a memorandum to the Central Government, saying that to avoid a situation like Doklam, it should intensify its exercise of sovereignty to Tibet
 swadeshi jaagran manch ke gyaapan ke mutabik bharat sarkaar ko antarrashtriya manch par tibet kii aazaadee ke liye apni koshishon ko tej karnaa chahie
 India needs to build new alliances around the world as well as intensify awareness campaigns to get Tibet out of the clutches of China
 lihaaja, aresas kaa maananaa he ki tibet kii aazaadee ko vaishvik mudda banaakar bharat sarkaar china dwaara tibet main ho rahe maanavadhikaar ulanghan ko khatm karaane kii koshish kare
 With this move of India, it can liberate Tibet from the unrestrained forces of China, including the entire Kailash and Himalayas
 ise bhi padhein: china bharose modi kii saubhaahgya yojana, 24 ghante bijli ke liye 10 karod dollar karj ko manjurichin nahin doharaa paaegaa 'doklam'swadeshi jaagran manch kii daleel he ki jahaan ek taraf bharat kaa apane zyaadaatar padosi mulkon ke saath shanti or saajha vikaas kaa rishta majboot ho rahaa he vahiin china ne bharat samet bhutan or nepal ke ilaakon main apni vistaar kii niti ko thopa he
 Due to this policy, China recently tried to use its unrestrained forces in Doklam, a region of Bhutan adjoining Sikkim
 haalanki uski yah chaal bhutan or bharat ke saajha prayaason ke chalate safal nahin ho saki
 Taking a lesson from this, now India should speed up the exercise of removing all those areas including Tibet from the clutches of China so that China does not get the chance to create a situation like Doklam
 ise bhi padhein: bharat se yuddh hua to in 5 nuksaanon kii bharpai kabhi nahin kar paaegaa chinafri tibet se bharat ko milegaa bhutan jaisaa dostbhutan ke raja nai dilli kii yatra par hai
 The second example of bilateral relations between the two countries is not found all over the world
 donon desh aapasi suraksha ke saath-saath apni aarthik nitiyon ke nirdhaaran ke liye atoot rishte main vishwaas rakhte hai
 Due to this, the two countries worked with mutual support to thwart the attempt to occupy Doklam by China
 gauratlab he ki tibet main beete saat dashakon se china kii vistaar vaadi nitiyaan jari hai
 Due to this policy, the government of Tibet and the spiritual leader of Tibet, the Dalai Lama have been deported from Tibet
 china ke is maanavadhikaar ulanghan ke baad se hi tibet kii nirvasit sarkaar bharat se chal rahi he or lagaataar koshish kar rahi he ki vah tibet ko china ke changul se baahar nikaal le
 In such a situation, if India insists on this exercise proposed by the Union, then obviously the same relationship will exist between the two countries which exists between India and Bhutan

 i understand that the story melodies are among our best and will always be

 Vishal: We are in the mood on the stage

 padmavati film ke alaava anandapal jaise muddon par hamane bijepi kaa virodh kiya tha, lekin bijepi ne hamaari swarna aarthik aarakshan jaisi badi maang maan lee thi jisaki vajah se rajputon kaa bijepi se gussa kam to hua tha, lekin jis tarah se loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne rajputon ke saath chal kiya he, use dekhte hue hamane rajput ummidavaaron ko samarthan dene or baaki kii seat par is baar ghar baithne kaa faisla kiya he
 Gogamedi further said that the Rajputs have never been with the Congress
 aise main ham congress ke saath nahin ja sakate hai, lekin gujarat or chhattisgarh jaise bade rajyon main ek bhi rajput ko bijepi ne tikat nahin diya he
 Therefore, there is resentment in the Karni Sena against the BJP as well
 ab ham netaa banenge or rajputon kaa ek vot bank taiyaar karenge
 According to Gogamedi, Shri Rashtriya Rajput Karni Sena has called its executive meeting for this, which will consider the party's profile

 karani sena ke netaaon ke paise lekar bik jane ke sawaal par sukhdev singh gogamedi ne kaha ki jab ham kisi achche kaam ke liye bijepi kaa samarthan karte hai to congress ham par bikne kaa aarope lagaati he or agar ham congress kaa saport karte hai to bijepi aarope lagaati he
 Therefore, we will also form our political party

 jab ham vipaksh main the, hamane vidheyak (is sambandh main) ko paarit karaane main do baar congress or ensipi kaa samarthan kiya
 Today, when we are trying to do something honestly, the opposition is doing politics on the issue
 ' Uttarakhand BJP is in a fierce situation these days
 ek ore party 2017 main pradesh main sattarudh hone kaa daawa karte nahin thak rahi, vahiin duusari ore party kaa aglaa pradesh adhyaksh koun hoga, is mudde par hi koi faisla nahin ho paa rahaa he
 The party president was in a cloud over the last four by-elections in the state, having suffered defeat and the bjp's sweep in panchayati and local body elections
 ab to vartmaan adhyaksh tirath singh ravat kaa kaarykaal bhi puraa ho gaya he
 In such a situation, the biggest question is, who will be the next state president of BJP in Uttarakhand? The market of discussions and rumors about many names is hot
 satpal maharaj, saansad ramesh pokharial nishank, netaa pratipaksh ajay bhatta, saansad bhagat singh koshyari ke alaava party ke sanghathan mantri rah chuke or purv cabinet mantri trivendra singh or party ke sanghathan mantri rahe dow
 The names of Dhan Singh Rawat and Naresh Bansal are also being taken
 khatima se vidhayak pushkar singh dhami ke naam par bhi atakalein lag rahi hai
 Meanwhile, former Chief Minister and MP from Nainital Lok Sabha seat Bhagat Singh Koshyari has denied the rumor of his name
 ve kehete hai, “kisi yuva ko hi party adhyaksh banaaya janaa chahie
 Due to his proximity to Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, national spokesperson Anil Baluni is also said to be involved in the race for the post of president, but Baluni himself gave his clarification saying, "I am happy in Delhi
" isliye party kaa pradesh adhyaksh banane main meri koi ruchi nahin he
 The name of Leader of Opposition Ajay Bhatt is also included in the list of probables
 lekin ve bhi apni safai pesh karne main kisi se peeche nahin hai
 Ajay Bhatt says, “the party has honored me by making me the leader of the opposition
 ab main party adhyaksh kii kisi daud main shaamil nahin hum
 My focus is on the 2017 elections right now
 ” congress se bijepi main shaamil hue satpal maharaj kaa naam bhi uth rahaa he, lekin unhen party adhyaksh banaae jane par party main bikharaav kaa dar he
 Now former Chief Minister Dr
 ramesh pokharial nishank
 Party sources say that Nishank is trying to make Dhan Singh Rawat the president in the inner cell
 dhansingh ravat ke naam par purv mukhyamantriyon bhagat singh koshyari or bhuwan chandra khandudi ne maun saadh rakhaa he
 Khanduri says, "the party will decide what it wants
 disambar main yah tay ho jayega
 “the neutrality of these two is seen to be linked to the possible expansion of the Union Cabinet
 bijepi kaa maananaa he ki 2017 se pehle yadi kendriya mantrimandal main uttarakhand ko pratinidhitiv nahin diya gaya to congress ise bijepi ke khilaaf ek astr ke rup main bhunaayegi or party kaa kendriya netritv bhi yah samajhataa he
 After this, only two prominent names remain in the field & Dhan Singh Rawat and former Cabinet Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat
 trivendra singh loksabhaa chunaav ke samay unke saath upi main chunaav sahprabharee ke rup main kaam kar chuke hai or amit shah ke najdiki hai
 Koshiyari, Nishank and Bhuvan Chandra Khanduri have a silent agreement in the name of Dhan Singh
 sanghathan main bhi dhansingh kii majboot pakad he
 Now it has to be seen that which political mathematics finally fits right and which speculation proves right
 philhal adhyaksh pad ko lekar ho rahi uthal-puthal ke bich party 2017 kii chunavi taiyaariyon main pichad rahi he
 The Congress is making quick visits and announcements and is gaining ground in the public

 yachika main rajya sarkaar ne kaha he ki hycourt ne apane faisle main aay se adhik sampatti kaa galat aankalan kiya he
 The amount of Jayalalithaa's disproportionate assets is 76 per cent and not 8
 12 fisadi
 This mistake has made the order invalid
 yachika main aage kaha gaya ki hycourt main karnataka sarkaar ko apni daleel rakhane kaa mauka nahin diya gaya, kyonki maamle main rajya ko party hi nahin banaaya gaya
 Because of this, the entire legal process in the High Court got disturbed
 jabaki abhiyojan paksh ne saare sabooton ke bal par ye sabit kar diya tha ki jaya ke paas 66 karod kii sampatti he, lekin hycourt ne in sabooton par thik se gaur nahin kiya
 The comments aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle main special court ne jaya or teen anya ko chaar saal kii sajaa or 100 karod kaa jurmaana lagaaya tha
 Because of this, he had to lose the chief minister's chair, but in May this year, he was acquitted by the Karnataka High Court and said that if the income is ten per cent higher then it cannot be considered a crime
 iske baad jayalalita dobaaraa mukhyamantri ban gai thim
 She is now contesting from RK Nagar on June 27
 es main kaha ja saktaa he ki unki mushkilen abhi khatm nahin hui hai
 The petition further said that the Karnataka government was not given an opportunity to present its arguments in the High Court as the state was not made a party in the case
 isi vajah se hycourt main puri kanoonee prakriya bighad gai
 While the prosecution had proved on the basis of all the evidence that Jaya had assets worth Rs 66 crore, the High Court did not properly examine these evidence
 tippaniyan In the disproportionate assets case, the special court had sentenced Jaya and three others to four years of imprisonment and a fine of Rs 100 crore
 isaki vajah se unhen mukhyamantri kii kursi ganvaani padi thi, lekin isi saal may me karnataka hycourt ne unhen bari kar diya tha or kaha tha ki agar aay das fisadi zyada ho to use aparaadh nahin mana ja saktaa
 After this Jayalalithaa again became the Chief Minister

 haniprit kii talash main nepal tak khaak chaan rahi police ne dilli main bhi chhapemari kii lekin unka koi suraag nahin mil paaya
 Honeypreet, who is facing charges of treason, now has no other way but to surrender

 kuch aisa hi karti nazar aaengi lara datta film 'singh is bling' main jab wo band bajaayengi akshay or emi kii lav story kii
 The comments darasal film 'singh is bling' main akshay ko emi se pyaar ho jaataa he magar takaleef tab hoti he jab akshay ko angreji nahin aati or emi ko hindi nahin aati
 In such a situation, these two are unable to tell their point to each other and then Lara Dutta comes in their life
 lara datta kaa kaam he akshay kumaar kii baat ko angreji main emi tak pahunchnaa or emi kii baat ko hindi main anuwaad kar akshay ko bataanaa
 But since Lara does not like Akshay, she creates a rift between their love and translates each other's words directly
 chunki ye ek kamedi film he isliye lara kii ye bhoomika acchhee bataai ja rahi he or unke anuwaad main kaafii kamedi he
 Actually, in the film 'singh is Bling', Akshay falls in love with Amy but the problem is when Akshay does not know English and Amy does not know Hindi
 aise main ye donon apni baat ek duusare ko bataane main asamarth rahete hai or tab unki zindagi main aati hai lara datta
 Lara Dutta's job is to reach Akshay Kumar's talk to Amy in English and translate Amy's talk in Hindi to Akshay
 magar chunki lara ko akshay pasand nahin hai isliye wo inke ishq ke bich daraar banaati hai or ek duusare kii kahi baton kaa ulta sidhaa anuwaad karti hai
 Since this is a comedy film, this role of Lara is said to be good and her translation is quite a comedy
 chunki ye ek kamedi film he isliye lara kii ye bhoomika acchhee bataai ja rahi he or unke anuwaad main kaafii kamedi he

 ab yah andolan or tej hota dikh rahaa he
 The agitation has been going on since June 1: Farmers in Maharashtra started agitation on June 1 for various demands including loan waiver and guarantee of MSP due to crop failure
 maharashtra ke kisaanon ne devendra fadanvis sarkaar ke khilaaf ‘kisaan kranti’ naam se andolan shuru kiya he, to madhyapradesh main bhi kisaanon ne apni maang lekar 1 se 10 june tak mandiyon ko maal na pahunchane kaa andolan shuru kar diya he
 Agitating farmers dumped large quantities of milk on the highway in Ahmednagar district
 vahiin kisaanon ne chetavanee di he ki agar unki maangen nahin maani gayi to ve andolan jari rakhenge
 Where did the beginning of the peasant movement in Maharashtra started from the village of Puntamba located on the banks of river Godavari in Ahmed Nagar district

 These are the main demands of the farmers - all the debts of the farmers should be forgiven - Swaminathan Commission recommendations should be implemented - Government should give loans without interest for agriculture - Farmers under 60 years of age should be given pension - 50 per liter for milk The new center built in Rs
 isliye aisi ashanka he ki agar yah andolan khatm nahin hua to in sabakaa asar mumbai or aas-paas ke shaharon par padegaa
 If there is no reconciliation between the farmer leaders and the government, then the crisis can deepen in Mumbai and surrounding cities

 All decisions related to the farmers' strike will be taken in Nashik, due to which there are signs of a split in the strike

 While the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh strongly criticized the agreement, saying that the government is being afraid of this movement and adopting such tactics, the Bharatiya Kisan Union said that their organization had started the strike and will do the same
 duusare gut abhi bhi hadtaal par kaayam hai
 The reason for the agitation in MP is that the farmer leaders of Madhya Pradesh say that the farmers are not getting the right price for their produce
 jitna paisa ve apni fasal ugane main laga rahe hai, utana unhen use bechney main nahin mil rahaa he
 This has worsened the condition of farmers and they are under debt
 madhyapradesh sarkaar ne gehun ko nunatam samarthan mulya 1625 rupee prati quintal nirdhaarit kiya he, lekin sarkaar kisaanon ke gehun ko is keemat par nahin kharid rahi he, jiske kaaran unhen apane utpaada ko 1200 rupee se 1300 rupee prati quintal majaburi main bazaar main bechnaa pad rahaa he

 com / mzx8fraked Saina Nehwal's dream of becoming the first Indian World Champion in Badminton was shattered when she suffered a straight game defeat against defending champion Caralina Marin of Spain in the title match here today
 duniya kii duusare number kii bhartiya khilaadi ko apni chir pratindvadwi sheersh variya ke khilaaf 59 minute main 16-21, 19-21 se shikast jhelni padi
 Saina lost in the finals of a major competition for the second time in a row
 yah rajat padak haalanki vishwa championships main kisi bhartiya khilaadi kaa sarvshereshth pradarshan he
 Saina had earlier lost to Marin in the final of the All England Championship earlier this year
 vishwa championships main yah bharat kaa paanchvaan padak he
 PV Sindhu had earlier won bronze medals in 2013 and 2014, while the women's doubles pair of Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa also won bronze in 2011
 vishwa championships main bharat ke liye pehla padak 1983 main diggaj badminton khilaadi prakaash padukon ne kaansya padak ke rup main jeeta tha
 Saina had won three of the last four matches against Spain's Marin and had lost one, so on paper she was considered a strong contender
 aal england final main haalanki sina ko haraane vaali marin shuru se hi lay main najar ain
 Marin was showing great enthusiasm and shouting after winning every point, due to which the chair umpire explained to him
 unhen apane racket ko sammaan nahin dene par ek baar chetavanee bhi di gai
 After a 7-7 draw in the first game, the world's number one player maintained the lead and won the first game
 pehle game main madhyantar tak marin ne 11-8 kii badhat bana lee thi
 Taking advantage of Saina's mistakes, she led the score to 15-9
 marin ne iske baad 13-20 kii badhat banaai
 Saina tried to come back by winning some points, but after her shot was out, the Spaniard won the first game
 duusare game main haalanki bhartiya khilaadi ne joardaar vaapasi kii or marin kii galatiyon kaa phayda uthaaya
 Indian players were leading 11-6 at the time of intermission
 marin ne haalanki haar nahin maani or lagaataar chah ank ke saath 12-12 ke score par barabari hasil kar lee
 The Spaniard spared Saina for her speed and played shots targeting her body
 tippaniyan Saina tried to bounce back after playing some long rally
 marin ne haalanki 17-17 ke score par barabari ke baad ahm maukey par dabadabaa banaate hue 20-18 kii badhat banaai or apane lagaataar duusare vishwa khitaab kii ore kadam badaye
 Marin then lost his first championship point, but he won the game, match and title on the second
 is jeet ke baad marin jashn manaate hue court par let gayi jabaki khitaab jeetne kaa sunaharaa mauka ganvaane ke baad sina niraashaa main court se baahar chali gai
 The world number two Indian player had to go down 16-21 19-21 in 59 minutes against her arch-rival top seed
 sina ko lagaataar duusari baar kisi badi pratiyogita ke final main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 This silver medal, however, is the best performance by an Indian player in a World Championship
 sina ko isse pehle isi saal ol england championships ke final main hi marin ke haathon haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 This is India's fifth medal in the World Championship
 isse pehle pivi sindhu ne 2013 or 2014 main kaansya padak jeeta tha jabaki jwaala gutta or ashvini ponppa kii mahila yugal jodi bhi 2011 main kaansya padak jeetne main safal rahi thi
 The first medal for India at the World Championship was won in 1983 as a bronze medal by veteran badminton player Prakash Padukone
 spain kii marin ke khilaaf sina ne pichley chaar main se teen mukaable jite the or ek ganvaaya tha, isliye kaagajon par unhen prabal daavedaar mana ja rahaa tha
 However, Marin, who defeated Saina in the All England Finals, looked in rhythm from the beginning
 marin har ank jeetne ke baad ati utsaah dikhaa rahi thi or chilla rahi thi jiske kaaran chair ampire ne unhen samajhaayaa bhi
 He was also warned once for not honoring his racket
 pehle game main 7-7 kii barabari ke baad duniya kii number ek khilaadi ne badhat banaae rakhi or pehla game apane naam kiya
 Marin took an 11–8 lead at halftime in the first game
 sina kii galatiyon kaa phayda uthaate hue unhone score 15-9 tak pahunchaaya
 Marin then led 13–20
 sina ne kuch ank jitkar vaapasi kii koshish kii, lekin unke shaat baahar maarane par spain kii khilaadi ne pehla game jeet liya

 com / 2cn1tzhekl —tejashwi Yadav (@yadavtejashwi) February 24, 2018 Tejashwi also questioned the Muzaffarpur police and asked why Manoj Baitha, the driver of Bolero car and BJP leader has not been caught by the police even after so many hours of the incident? Tejashwi alleged that the Bihar government was trying to save Manoj Baitha
 tejasvi ne yah bhi sawaal uthaaya ki aakhir bolero gaadi ke driver ko sharaab kahaan se mili jabaki rajya main sharabbandi lagu he? Former champions France lost some of their best chances to score a goalless draw against Uruguay in their first match in Group a of World Cup football here today
 apni sarajameen par 1998 main champion bane france ke liye yah lagaataar teesraa avasar he jabaki uski team vishwa cap ke apane shuruaati match main gol nahin kar paayi
 In fact, the French team scored the last time in the first match of the World Cup played outside their country in 1986
 francisi team ke paas is myth ko todane ke aaj kuch achche avasar the lekin khachaakhach bhare green point stadium main use aakhir main ank baantne ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 Even as Uruguay substitute Nicolas Lodero received a red card (due to another yellow card) in the 81st minute, France had to overcome a ten-man challenge in the last ten minutes but failed to take advantage
 france ko aathven minute main hi badhat banane kaa sunaharaa mauka mila tha jab frank riberi ne baayin taraf se striker sidney govu ko paas diya lekin vah lakshya bhedane main asafal rahe
 Gowu has not been able to score for France since 2008 and once again he missed the pressure which clearly showed the pressure on him due to which he could not make the exact shot
 iske do minute baad abo diabi kaa shaat bhi baahar chalaa gaya
 When there was only three minutes left for the final whistle, Anri got the ball to Golmukh but his shot hit the arm of the Uruguay defender for which the French team demanded a penalty but the referee rejected it
 urugway ko shuru main lay hasil karne ke liye jujhna padaa
 He got his first chance to score in the 17th minute when captain Diogo Fourlain got the ball on the edge of the box but his fine shot from the right foot was pushed out by goalkeeper Hugo Lloris with a palm
 iske do minute baad francisi plamekar yoan gorakaph ne free kik par acha shaat lagaaya lekin urugway ke golkeeper furnando musalera ne furti dikhaate hue use bachaa diya
 After this, the first half game remained limited in the midfield and in the last 15 minutes, neither team tried to move towards the goal
 urugway ke captain forlan ke paas 74wein minute main apni team ko badhat banane kaa mauka tha lekin lui surej ke paas par unka shaat baahar chalaa gaya
 Fourlain showed good form but did not get enough support from other players
 is bich dominek ne 72wein minute main anelka kii jagah thiyare aanari ko utaara 
 This is his 16th match in the World Cup and he has come close to breaking the French record of 17 matches of Fabian Barthes
 france ke patric evera, riberi or tolalan jabaki urugway ke marsiyo victorino or digo lugaano ko pilaa card mila
 Lodiro of Uruguay stayed on the field for only 16 minutes but in the meantime he had to look at the yellow card twice and his team had to put all their strength to save the goal in the last few minutes
 france jahaan vishwa cap ke shuruaati match main gol nahin kar paane kaa myth nahin tod paaya vahiin do purv champiyanon ke bich pehle daur ke match kaa parinaam nahin nikalne kaa myth vishwa cap ke saath judaa rahaa 
 It was the eighth occasion in the World Cup while the two former winning teams faced each other in the first round
 inamen se chah avasaron par match dra rahe
 Syeda Shadab Fatima, who was part of Shivpal Yadav's party, attacked the SP-BSP alliance and said that Akhilesh used to wear half pants when the bicycle went off
 upi main sapa sarkaar main purv mantri raheen or shivpal yadav kii party pragatisheel samaajawaadee party kii rashtriya upaadhyaksh saiyyada shaadaab fatima ne sapa-basapa gathbandhan par kaha ki inkaa makasad chunaav main pratyaashiyon se keval paisa vasuulana he or inkaa janata kii samasyaon se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 Fatima said that Mayawati is leading the SP-BSP alliance and Akhilesh Yadav will close his eyes on the path that Mayawati will show
 fatima ne kaha ki akhilesh yadav ne na sangharsh kiya he or na karenge
 He said about the SP-BSP alliance that earlier Mayawati used to say that climbing the goons chest, press the button on the elephant and now the game of aunt and nephew is going on, then people will say that goons will shoot in the dock in the chest
 unhone ramgopal yadav or ajam khan ko aade haath lete hue kaha ki ramgopal yadav ko certificate nahin de sakate
 Along with Mulayam Singh, Shivpal Yadav had a great contribution in building the Samajwadi Party
 ajam khan par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki 'sapa ke netaa hai janaab mohammad ajam khan
 In a public meeting in 2017, the BSP had said that the silver platter contained dirt wrapped in silver plinth, it should not be touched
 ajam khan ab kya karenge
 Your leader Akhilesh Yadav has applied the dirt wrapped in a silver ring in the same silver platter like sandalwood on the forehead
 kya aap use maathe par lagaaoge?'fatima ne gajipur main ye baaten kahin
 Fatima was an MLA from SP in the sixteenth assembly assembly of UP
 2012 main inhone jahurabad vidhaan sabha nirvachan kshetra (nirvachan sankhya-377) se chunaav jeeta
 Fatima is now in the Progressive Samajwadi Party of Shivpal Yadav's party
 shivpal yadav kii party puure pradesh main kanoon vyavastha, kisaanon or aamajan kii samasyaon ko lekar 6 farvari ko bijepi sarkaar ke khilaaf dharna pradarshan karegi
 Fatima will also perform a dharna at Sarju Pandey Park in Ghazipur

 But when this mind becomes distorted, it does not take long to do the disgusting work

 The case is from Chandavali village in Ballabhgarh, Haryana, where a case of rape of a 12-year-old daughter by a father has come to light
 peedit ladki ke bayaan ke anusaar uskaa pita 6 saal kii umr se hi uskaa rape karata aa rahaa he
 The girl said that her father used to feed her mother unconscious medicine before raping her so that her mother could not get a clue of this

 The victim girl studies in fourth grade
 ladki ne bataaya ki uske pita ne beete buudhvaar bhi uske saath rape kiya
 This time the girl dared to inform her loved ones about the incident, after which this matter was told to her mother
 lekin maa koi thos kadam nahin uthaa pai
 The troubled girl then mentioned this to her school teacher
 iske baad skool kii teacher ne anya teachers se baat kar peedit ladki kii maa ko skool bulaayaa
 Then they informed the police about this
 police cese darj kar maamle kii tafteesh main jute gai he
 The victim girl has been sent for medical examination, along with the search for the absconding father
 bhartiya vaayu sena agle kuch hafton main pashchimi simaaon par israeli vaayu raksha missile pranali (SPYDER) kii madad se raksha tantra ko majbootee degaa

 agar padosi mulk vimaan, krooj missile, nigaraanee vimaan yaa drone dwaara hamaare hawaii kshetra ke ulanghan karne kii koshish karata he to SPYDER use naakaam karne main sakasham hoga
 What is SPYDER? An Israeli SPYDER capable of surface-to-air assault can destroy an enemy between 15 km and 20 and 9000 m altitude
 raksha sutron ke mutabik bhartiya vayusenacshaudhai kaa istemaal sataha se hawa main maar karne vaale swadeshi missile akaash ke saath karegi
 The deal was done in 2008, the Indian Air Force had signed a deal to buy SPYDER in 2008 itself
 deal ke teen-chaar maheenon ke baad supplai bhi shuru ho gai thi
 The process was slightly delayed due to the absence of certain Tatra trucks
 tatra trakon kii kharid main ghoose lene-dene kaa aarope laga tha

 Manmohan's visit did not have much opportunity to convey ideas, thanks to the fallout between Thanksgiving's major national holiday and the recent us-china dialogue, which also precipitated this conversation

 In keeping with the context of the apparent comment made by the Indian Prime Minister about China's "aggressive attitude" in the esteemed think tank of washington-council of Foreign Relations, Obama has clearly tarnished India's nerves through his statement
 Wanted to calm down lekin jab baat aati he sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main bharat kii ummidavaari ko samarthan dene kii, to maansingh ke mutabik is maamle main obama kuch bhi spasht nahin kehete or bagaiyr patibaddhta ke bade-bade vaktavy dete hai
 Apart from China, another issue related to foreign policy that emerged prominently in the tour was the growing uncertainty about Afghanistan

 While supporting India's role in Afghanistan, Obama appeared unwilling to go further in this direction to see what else India could contribute to the issue, including possibly training Afghanistan's security forces

 It is believed that the US has insisted on giving more details and assurances of the need for nuclear non-proliferation, due to which both sides have not reached agreement on reprocessing

 Senior BJP leader LK Advani has been considered a powerful speaker in the Parliament
 lekin ab yamuna main kaaphi pani bah chukaa he or unki duniya puri tarah se badal gai he
 His speaking in Parliament is steadily declining

 In the last five years, Advani has been able to speak only 365 words in Parliament
 8 agast, 2012 ko loksabhaa main bhartiya janata party ne ek sthagan prastaav pesh kiya
 The issue was the increasing illegal infiltration and ethnic violence in Assam
 vipaksh kii bahes kaa netritv kar rahe the bhaajapa ke ‘louh purush’ laal krishna adwani
 The documents of the House indicate that there was a lot of noise during the debate
 manmohan singh kii upie-tu sarkaar is paksh main nahin thi ki sadan apni dainik kaarywahi sthagit kar assam kii sthiti par charchaa kare
 This may have been the reason that there was a continuous blockage in the House
 par adwani apane bhaashan se dige nahin
 The ruling party increased the barrier but Advani kept on speaking
 laal krishna adwani ke liye yah koi nai chunauti nahin thi
 He faced many such situations in his long political journey
 adwani kaa bhaashan lagbhag 5000 shabdon kaa tha
 Lok Sabha documents show that there were at least 50 disruptions during this speech
 ant main sadan ne vipaksh kaa prastaav thukraa diya par adwani jo kahana chaahate the, vah wo kah chuke the
 Also read: In 5 years, LK Advani uttered only 365 words in Parliament despite 92% attendance
 Another date in this context is special, January 8, 2019
 loksabhaa kaa ek or din, bahes or baaki vyavdhaan
 This is not a new thing
 khaas baat yah thi ki bhaajapa kii narendra modi sarkaar loksabhaa main ek bill pesh kar rahi thi
 The name of the bill was Citizenship Amendment Bill
 iskaa makasad? modi sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki bangladesh, pakistan or afghanistan se aae wo sharnaarthi jo hindu, sikh, buddha, parsi yaa isaai hai, unhen bhartiya naagarikta milani chahie
 This bill can have a significant impact on the social and political situation of Assam
 iske taar sadhe-sidhe assam main dashakon se chale aa rahe gaiyrkanoonee ghuspaith or usase utpann hui jaateey hinsa se jude hai
 The day the bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha and the House passed it after a debate, Lal Krishna Advani was also present in the House
 par adwani charchaa ke dauraan khamosh rahe
 It was the same Advani who, 8 years ago, had cast his vote in the House on the Assam problem, bypassing 50 disruptions
 2008 se 2018 yani 8 varsh kaa antaraal
 a lot has changed during this time
 sarkaar badal gai, raajnneetik mausam badal gaya or badal gaye hai laal krishna adwani
 On evaluating the documents of Advani's Vakakshamatalok Sabha, it is found that in the last 5 years, Advani spoke only 365 words in the Lok Sabha
 agar ham isaki tulana 15veen lok sabha (2009-14) se karen, to yah pataa chalata he ki 16veen loksabhaa main adwani ke dwaara sadan main bole gaye shabdon main 99 fisadi kii giravat ai he
 Between 2009 and 2014, Advani spoke 35,926 words while participating in 42 debates
 duusari ore, adwani ne jo 365 shabd 16veen lok sabha main bole hai, ve sab ke sab 2014 main bole gaye the
 The Lok Sabha documents state that Advani made his last speech in the Lok Sabha on 19 December 2014
 agar aap yah soch rahe hai ki adwani un logon main se hai jinhen zyada bolnaa pasand nahin, to aap galatfahami main hai
 Advani wrote his autobiography, My Country My Life, then wrote over 1,000 pages on his life
 yah darshata he ki unke paas kehane ko bahut kuch he
 The Lok Sabha documents, available on its website, show that Lal Krishna Advani - a man who has been a member of Parliament 11 times, along with Atal Bihari Vajpayee, founded the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is today the bjp's most a senior leader, due to which this party became strong across the country - that person had only 365 words to speak in 5 years
 pichley 5 saal main adwani ne 5 baar loksabhaa kii bahes main bhaag liya
 Of these, 2 occasions were the election of speaker and deputy speaker
 in dauraan adwani ne bhaashan to die, par ‘main is prastaav kaa samarthan karata hum’ kah apni vaani ko viraam de diya
 (on the contrary, remember on 6 June 2009
 loksabhaa main adwani mira kumaar ke spikar chune jane par unhen shubhakamanaayen de rahe the
 In his speech he uttered 440 words
 pichley 5 saal kii tulana main ye 75 shabd adhik the
 ) Apart from this, Advani presented the report of 2 Parliamentary Committee in the House
 is dauraan bhi unhone keval aupchaarikta puri karte hue report kaa naam padhaa or kaha ‘main ise sabha patal par rakhata hum’
 When Advani spoke in the Lok Sabha for the 5th time, the House was discussing Kashmir, the issue was about the refugees in Kashmir
 adwani ne apane chote se bhaashan main ek puraani report kaa zikr kiya or sadan se anurodh kiya ki vah is baat par vichaar kare ki kis tarah use lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 This is just the story of Lal Krishna Advani, once the 'iron Man' of BJP, in the last 5 years of Lok Sabha
 agar ham samay kii baat karen, to adwani ne 365 shabd bolne ke liye lagbhag 3 minute liye honge
 Advani's sudden disappearance from the political corridors of the country is not a result of his waning age
 sach to yah he ki adwani bhale hi 91 varsh ke ho chuke hai lekin sansad main unki upasthiti ab bhi bemisaal he
 Advani's presence in the Lok Sabha has been 92 per cent in the last 5 years
 june 4, 2014 or janvari 8, 2019 ke bich loksabhaa ke 16 satr rahe
 In all, the Lok Sabha worked for 321 days
 in 321 dinon main se 296 (92
 21%) on the day Advani was present in the House
 yah aankada kai mantriyon, aaj kii bhaajapa ke sheersh vaktaaon or vipaksh ke netaaon se kahin adhik hai
 In fact, Advani's attendance figure in the 16th Lok Sabha is 1 percent higher than the 15th Lok Sabha
 ab baat agar adwani ke pichley 21 saal ke sansadeey jivan kii karen to loksabhaa ke dastavej bataate hai ki 1998 or 2019 ke bich adwani 5 lok sabhaaon kaa hissaa rahe (12veen se 16veen)
 He was number two in the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and he was the leader of opposition in most of Manmohan Singh's rule
 aaj bhale hi adwani sansad kii pratham pankti main virajte hai par ab wo pehle vaale adwani nahin rahe jisaki garjana se sadan kabhi gunj uthta tha
 The last 21-year Lok Sabha documents show that Advani participated in a total of 300 debates during 1998 to 2019
 par inamen se keval 5 (1
 6 per cent) belonged to the current Lok Sabha
 march 21, 1998 or april 15, 1999 (12veen loksabhaa) ke bich, jab bhaajapa kii sarkaar thi, bas ek saal ke andar adwani ne 57 bahason main bhaag liya
 Advani was the leader of Vajpayee's number two in the next Lok Sabha and during (1999–2004) he participated in 179 debates
 upie ek kii sarkaar ke dauraan (2004-2009), adwani ne 74 bahason main netaa vipaksh kii haisiyat se bhaag liya
 In the next 5 years (2009–14), he participated in 42 debates
