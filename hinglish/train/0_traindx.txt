 haalanki baithak main gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi or karnataka ke purv mukhyamantri bies yudiurppa nahin pahunche hai
 This led to the infighting of the BJP and it has got wind due to the decision of Narendra Modi in which he is not attending the meeting on the pretext of Navratri

 aaj kal kii bhagdaud bhari jindagi main pati-patni ke liye saath samay bitaa paanaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 From home to office and from children to managing the lives of the elders, often couples are unable to find time for themselves
 jaahir he aise main rishton main naaraazgi badhane lagati he, lekin in sab ke bich sabase adhik dukh tab hota he jab couples khaas plan kiye holiday bhi mouj-masti or ekadusre ke saath kii bajaay bahes or tu-tu-main-main main bitaa dete hai
 In such a situation, the holiday planned to get along with each other brings bitterness instead of dissolving the sweetness in the relationship
 haal hi ek videshi online website 'get yor guide' kii ore se jari ek report ke mutabik har chaar main se ek kapal apane holiday ko enjoy karne kii bajaay tu-tu-main-main main bitaate hai
 However, the report of the website mentions five such factors that cause mood swings on the holiday
 aise main agar aap holiday plan kar rahe hai to in baton kaa khyal jarur rakhen-1
 Long line and wait If you have chosen such a time for the holiday when you usually go to all vacations, then obviously you have to be a part of a long queue everywhere from hotels to restaurants, taxis to movie theaters
 maaf kiijie, lekin intjaar kii yah ghadi aapke or aapke saathi ke liye naaraazgi kaa kaaran ban sakati he
 2
 sab kuch man mutabik naa honajab kabhi aap holiday plan karte hai to destination se lekar hotel ke salection tak sab kuch khaas chaahate hai
 It has to be done very well but sometimes when vacation starts, all is not according to your thinking
 yah baicheni lekar aata he
 You want to give happiness to your partner, but your mind gets frustrated and the result is debate, pique and what
 
 what
 
 
 3
 Carefully, do not get lost if you choose a destination for the holiday where you do not know the language and where you are planning to move around on a map instead of a guide, then be careful
 website ke anusaar aksar aisi jagahon par kho jane kaa dar rahata he
 It is also difficult to find address due to lack of knowledge of language
 ab ekadusre ke pyaar main khona to acchhee baat he, lekin is tarah raste main khona aapke saathi ko naaraaz kar saktaa he
 4
 kharch, paisa or bajtakahin bhi holiday plan karne se pehle apana bajet bana len, kyonki ain maukey par bajet kii kami yaa behisaab kharch aapke vaikeshan ko barbaad kar saktaa he
 Think for yourself if your partner wants to go shopping and you tell them what will happen if you do not have money? 5
 talmail kii kamiakhri lekin sabase ahm sabak
 It is not necessary that your and your spouse's thinking exactly matches
 aise main akasar dekha jaataa he ki holiday par jane ke baad couples yah dyside nahin kar pate ki unhen movie dekhne janaa he yaa shopping kerani he
 They would like to go to a museum or a fun center
 agali baar aise kisi halaat se bachane ke liye thodaa compramij karnaa seekhen

 He said that Ramlala was made a party to the case when his property was attached under Section 145 of the crpc
 iske baad civil court ne vahaan kuch bhi karne se roak laga di
 Parasaran said, "ramlala had to become a party if the court refused to consider Ram Janmabhoomi as a legal person (juristic person)

 We consider him a living being
 ' paraasaran ne is baat par jor diya ki devtaa kii upasthiti ek nyaayik vyakti hone kaa ek maatr pareekshan nahin he

 Seeing his condition, he was afraid that it might fall
 ise lekar maine railway or biemasi ko teen se chaar baar patr bhi likhaa tha
 But there was no hearing
 unhone kaha ki is haadase ke liye railway se zyada biemasi jimmedaar he
 Right now Railway and BMC officials will accuse each other and then the matter will settle down
 kyonki wo jaanate hai ki mumbaikar aisi chijen jaldi bhul jate hai
 He also said that personally i am also responsible

 He said that there are still many such bridges in Mumbai on which there is a fear while passing that there should be no accident
 saath hi unhone kaha ki main ab hoicourt jaaoongaa or in maamalon ko uthaaungaa
 Please tell that Pankaj is himself a lawyer of the High Court
 pankaj ne kaha ki yah sab isliye ho rahaa he kyonki adhikariyon ko pataa he ki kuch bhi nahin hona he, sabhi baaten filon main dabakar rah jaaengi
 He said that the officers investigating this bridge should be acted upon
 vahiin, ab maamle main raajnneeti shuru ho chuki he
 The state has a BJP government and the BAC is occupied by the Shiv Sena
 biemasi kaa kahana he ki footover brij railway ke hisse main aata he, to vahiin railway kaa kahana he ki yah pul biemasi ke adheen aata he
 In such a situation, the Congress has demanded the resignation of Railway Minister Piyush Goyal, blaming the Railways for the accident

 a video of a school is going viral on social media in which children are seen registering their presence through an identity card scanner
 daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki yahvidiodilli ke ek skool kaa he jahaan arvind kejariwal sarkaar ne atandence ke liye hytech mashine lagavai hai
 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the viral video is not from Delhi but from Rawalpindi in Pakistan
 fasebuk pej 'shyam Prakash' ne is video ko post karte hue capshan main likhaa he, 'dekho kejariwal ne dilli ke skulon ko kya bana diya, jise sara sansar dekhne aa rahaa he, bacchon ke skool main hajiri lagate hi massej ghar pahunch jaataa he'
 By the time the news was written, this post has been shared more than 30,000 times
 is post kaa archivd varjanayahandekha ja saktaa he
 This video is viral on Facebook
 AFWA kii padtaalis daawey kii jaanch ke liye hamane video ke ek kii-frem ko reverse search kiya
 We found that the same video was also posted by Gul Laghari, a Facebook user from Pakistan
 capshan main unhone urdu main likhaa he, “rawalpindi ke ek privet skool main hajiri dete chaatr
 Online attendant system giving information via SMS alert to parents
 ” yah video 31 july ko post kiya gaya he
 We investigated further and found that the same video, on the same day, was also posted by another Facebook user 'bilal Keyani' with the same caption
 haalanki, bilal keyani ne kareeb ek hafte pehle yah video ripost karte hue likhaa, 'lediunya skool system'
 Bilal has written in thefacebook page on Bio that he is the Managing Director of the 'leaders' School System and Montessori' based in Rawal Pindi, Pakistan
 hamane bilal se sampark kiya to unhone isaki pushti kii ki ledins skool ke islamabad or rawalpindi main paanch campus hai or sabhi jagah yah si stem lagaaya gaya he
 Whenever children enter school or drop out of school, they have to punch their card in the Attendance system and their parents get the information through the message
 bilal ne bataaya ki jo video viral ho rahaa he vah ledins skool system ke rawalpindi campus kaa he
 We found this same video on the official Facebook page of this school, which is posted on July 31 at 7:50 am
 hamen pej par bilal kii tasviren bhi milin jinamein ve bhaashan de rahe hai yaa skool ke bacchon ko puraskaar de rahe hai
 We tried to contact the authorities to know whether the Delhi government has introduced such a system in any of its schools
 agar unka jawaab aata he to khabar apadet kar di jaaegi
 It is thus clear that the video going viral has nothing to do with Delhi or Kejriwal government
 yah video rawalpindi, pakistan ke ek skool kaa he

 ' karnataka or goa main congress vidhayak dal main hui sendhamari se madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri kamalnath satark ho gaye hai
 After bringing two BJP mlas into his camp, Kamal Nath wants to continue playing on the front foot
 ab unke target par bijepi ke wo netaa or vidhayak hai, jo party ke liye 'managers' kii bhoomika main hai
 The Congress is also eyeing the mlas who are involved in mining and liquor business and due to this, their pulse is in the hands of the government
 kamalnath sarkaar ne shivaraj sarkaar main mantri rahe bijepi ke varisht vidhayak narottam mishra par shikanja kas diya he
 The investigation into the e-tendering scam has intensified
 i-tendering ghotaale kii jaanch main rajya aarthik aparaadh anveshan beuro (iodblyoo) ne narottam mishra ke do puraane karmchaaree virendra pandey or nirmal avasthi ko jail bhej diya he
 The Director General of EOW had told journalists that the raids of the arrested people have found strong evidence of tampering (tampering) in tenders
 puri padtaal ke baad pradesh ke kai bade chehre benakaab honge
 The special thing is that Narottam Mishra is considered the manager of the BJP and is a master of 'sabotage' in the opposition parties
 iodblyoo kii chhapemari main jo dastavej mili hai, ve jal sansaadhan vibhaag se sambandhit hai
 In the Shivraj government, the minister of this department was Narottam Mishra
 mishra ne apane puraane sahyogiyon kii giraftaar par kaha he ki chaparasi or babu jaise logon ko kamalnath sarkaar tang kar rahi he
 Tenders are not approved without passing at the level of Principal Secretary, Additional Chief Secretary and Chief Secretary
 sarkaar unki charitra hatya par amada he lekin vah ghabaraane vaale nahin hai
 Warning the Director General of EOW, Mishra said that do not make rhetoric under the pressure of the government, governments keep coming
 pukhta sabooton ke aadhaar par hi baat karen
 When the BJP was in power in Madhya Pradesh, Narottam Mishra used to speak
 congress ke kai vidhayakon ko todakar bijepi main laane main mishra ne ahm bhoomika adaa kii thi
 Mishra had an important role in the defections of Bhagirath Prasad, who had quit the party suddenly after getting Congress ticket from Chaudhary Rakesh Singh to Sanjay Pathak and Congress ticket
 bijepi kii lagaataar dhamkiyon ke bich congress vidhayakon main tut-foot yaa paala badalane kii sambhaavnaaon ke maddenjar sabase zyada nigahen narottam mishra kii gatividhiyon par hi rakhi ja rahi thim
 This is the reason why Narottam Mishra has come first on the target of Kamal Nath government
 i-tendering kii tarah kamalnath sarkaar kii najar bahucharchit vyaapman or danpar ghotaale par bhi he
 Former Chief Minister and Congress leader Digvijay Singh has written a letter to the Chief Minister regarding the Vyapam Scam
 digvijay ne patr main kaha ki ghotaale ke mukhya aropiyon ko kanoon ke daayre main laakar sajaa dilaane ke liye aavashyak pahal kii jaae
 Digvijay Singh has said that the Vyapam scam came to light during the entrance examination of medical colleges in the year 2013
 is ghotaale ko sirf medical pariksha tak simit rakhaa gaya
 The then government made the students pawn and accused only the students and youth in the case, while the main accused who carried out the scam were saved
 isi ke baad kamalnath sarkaar ne vyaapman ghotaale kii file kholana shuru kar di he
 It is believed that under the pretext of this investigation, the Kamal Nath government can take Shivraj Singh on target
 kamalnath sarkaar danpar ghotaale ke 'jinn' ko bhi ek baar phir bottle se baahar nikaal sakati he
 Madhya Pradesh Home and General Administration Minister Dr
 Govind Singh recently gave a statement that the Shivraj government had done a smudge in the investigation of dumper scam
 is maamle kii file ko band kar diya gaya tha
 He said that several important points related to the case were ignored in the investigation
 sarkaar nae sire se is puure maamle kii jaanch karaayegi
 The reality of the dumper scam will definitely be brought before the people of the state

 # priyankachopraa post shared by Priyanka Chopra Network (@priyankanetwork) on Sep 4, 2017 at 6:15am PDT The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has started making a dent in the BJP
 AAP ne meerut main bijepi ko pehla bada jhatka diya he
 Here, BJP leader and president of the United Trade Union Naveen Gupta joined the Aam Aadmi Party on 5 January
 naveen gupta meerut kii vyapaaree raajnneeti ke dhurandhar netaa hai
 Having been the General Secretary of the Joint Trade Union for the last thirty years, the President has been elected recently
 naveen ke AAP main shaamil hone ke baad baad unke saath vyapaar sangh ke kai anya padaadhikariyon ke jane kii bhi charchaa ho rahi he
 However, Naveen Gupta has said that nobody will come with him at the moment
 lekin mana ja rahaa he ki sheeghra hi kai bade vyapaaree netaa AAP main shaamil hokar bijepi ko jhatka de sakate hai
 Naveen Gupta's entry into the Aam Aadmi Party is being considered as part of the Lok Sabha election strategy
 charchaa he ki naveen gupta meerut seat se AAP ke pratyaashee ho sakate hai
 If this happens, it would be a second setback for the BJP

 There is no talk about drugs in Punjab today
 isliye nahin ho rahi he ki koi film aa gai he yaa chunaavon ko dekhte hue kumaar vishwaas ne ek music video bana diya he ki nashe kii lat chhod do
 There have been many reports on Punjab's intoxication in letter journals for many years
 outluk, india today, tahalaka, times of india, hindustan times, scrol, enditivi se lekar tribune, tamaam akhbaar, channel or patrikaon main punjab main drugs kii bhayaavah kahaniyaan aati rahi hai

 In April 2012, the New York Times has the story that one of the states of India has been badly intoxicated
 2014 main al jazira ne report chhaapi he ki drug hurricane ne punjab ko apni chapet main le liya he
 From the Washington Post to London's Daily Mail, Punjab has published stories of drugs

 Chittiyan Kalaiyan Way, this song you heard some time back
 lekin yah chitta shabd nashe par bane geeton main aakar khataranaak ho jaataa he
 Chitta means white color
 heroin kaa powder bhi safed hota he isliye punjab main drugs ke liye chitta kaa istemaal hota he
 So Chitta Way is a song from Anurag Kashyap's film Udta Punjab and Chitta is also mentioned in the music video of Aam Aadmi Party leader Kumar Vishwas
 kumaar kaa video raajnneetik bhi he, sidhaa sidhaa badal sarkaar par hamalaa karata he
 This video has been viewed more than 11 lakh times with just one link on youtube
 anuraag kashyap kii film kaa gaanaa chitta ve ko 37 lakh se zyada baar dekha ja chukaa he
 These songs are definitely being talked about on the drug epidemic in Punjab these days, but the issue of addiction was also in 2012 when Rahul Gandhi said that 7 out of 10 people in Punjab are addicted
 tab akali dal ke netaa prakaash singh badal ne kaha tha ki hamaare yuvaaon kii chhavi bigaadane kii koshish he
 Rahul Gandhi should apologize to the youth of Punjab
 apane netaa ke bachaav main tab manish tiwari ne court main diya punjab sarkaar kaa hi halafanama pesh kiya tha ki punjab kaa 70 pratishat yuva nashe kaa shikaar he
 This affidavit was submitted by the BJP Akali government of Punjab
 9 june yani aaj hamaare sahyogi anand patel ne mohali main punjab ke swasthya mantri se baat kii
 He still has the same position then in 2012
 isi saal janvari main ol india medical science ne ek report prakashit kii thi
 This report says that no one has the exact number of people in Punjab who are addicted to drugs
 ames ne yah adhyayan bharat sarkaar ke samaaj kalyaan mantralay ke kehane par hi kiya tha
 Under this, a survey was conducted in ten districts of Punjab
 survey ke dauraan drugs ke shikaar 3620 yuvaaon se baatcheet kii gai to pataa chalaa ki 76 fisadi nashedi 18 se 35 saal ke hai
 99 percent of these are boys and 54 percent are married
 89 fisadi ladke padhe likhe hai or inamen se koi mazdoor kisaan he, sarkari karmchaaree he to bijnesaman he
 54 percent of addicts are living in villages
 survey ke anumaan ke anusaar kam se kam paune do lakh or adhik se adhik kareeb dhai lakh log nashe ke shikaar hai
 Heroin is most commonly used
 opium ke chure kaa bhi chalan he
 Recently you must have heard about the illegal cultivation of opium at the time of Malda dispute in Bengal
 heroin ke liye ek aadmi rose 1400 rupee kharch karata he
 The survey says that the young man from Punjab is spending Rs 20 crore every day on heroin and opium
 ek saal main drugs kaa anumaanit corobaar saadhe saat hazaar karod kaa he
 Where the drugs worth 20 crores are being sold daily, should we not know who is behind its network
 drugs kaa kaarobaar bina kisi sangathit giroh or sargana ke ho hi nahin saktaa he
 There have been political allegations at times
 inase bachane ke liye rajya sarkaar ne nashe ke kilaaf abhiyaan chalaane kaa bhi daawa kiya he
 These days Indian Express is continuously publishing reports on the narco war of Punjab
 is siries kii khaasiyat ye he ki aath maheene tak express ke samvaadadaataaon ne is par kaam kiya he
 In today's journalism, if you get to spend eight months working on all the aspects of a story, then you understand what will be its level
 ye main khaas taur se isliye bataa rahaa hum ki reporting band hoti ja rahi he
 Without reporting you cannot get the information of the correct facts
 sawaal karnaa zaruri hota he
 Questions arise from the ground and not from the studio
 khayr
 Express has obtained a copy of the FIR registered under the Narcotics Act under the Right to Information Act
 express ke samvaadadaataaon ne paaya ki 2014 main jab punjab sarkaar ne nashe ke kilaaf abhiyaan chalaaya to iske tahat us saal 17,068 log giraftaar kiye gaye
 As of December 2015, 11,593 people were arrested
 itani sankhya main log giraptaar kiye gaye magar hamaare sahyogi anand patel ko punjab ke swasthya mantri kehete hai ki punjab main nashe kii samasya he hi nahin
 Express reporters received 6,598 copies of firs from 152 police stations in 14 districts of Punjab and started studying them
 pataa chalaa ki 42 fisadi yuva bahut kam drugs rakhane ke aarope main giraftaar kiye gaye hai
 Mostly 5 grams or less of heroin was recovered or 50 grams or less of opium
 kisi ke paas jali hui maachis kii dibbi bhi mili to wo bhi giraftaar hua or kisi ke paas se jali hui silver foile mili to wo bhi giraftaar hua
 In their study, Express correspondents found that in such a large operation more than 6000 people are arrested and not one of them is a big fish
 express ke samvaadadaataaon ke naam hai varinder bhaatia, man aman singh chhina or navajivan gopal
 If someone works on a story for eight months, then it is possible to take his name
 ham tivi vaale ab irshyaa hi kar sakate hai
 i hope you read the right newspaper
 khayr
 So these reporters notice another pattern in the FIR that is wonderful
 tippaniyan After seeing several firs, it seemed that cut and paste has been done
 matlab yahaan se liya vahaan chipka diya
 Different people have been arrested in different police stations but the story of being caught seems to be similar
 kai baar police kaa naakaa dekhte hi aaropee drugs phenk kar bhaagta he or pakadaa jaataa he
 Most of the people are caught taking drugs in bushes on the roadside, then someone is taking drugs against the wall
 abhi tak jo report prakashit hui he unamem kisi badi jagah se kisi kii giraftaar kaa zikr nahin miltaa he
 Lawyers told Express reporters that they should be arrested from a competent agency
 doctoron kaa kahana he ki jo nashe kii lat main giraptaar hue hai ve biimaar log hai
 Suppliers of drugs should be replaced in their place
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne disambar 2015 ke man kii baat main drugs kaa zikr kiya he
 He did not name Punjab but has requested social media to play a hashtag
 drugs free india
 Well a hashtag can be run and drugs free Punjab
 agar pradhanmantri apane man kii baat main ye kah de ton

 From the Washington Post to London's Daily Mail, Punjab has published stories of drugs
 outluk ne janvari 2011 main ek report chhaapi thi
 It has been told that in May 2009, when BSF recruited 376 soldiers in Tarn Taran, only 85 out of 8600 soldiers were eligible for service
 is report main commandent ajit kumaar ne kaha he ki ladakon kaa sharir kamazor pad gaya he
 Their umbrellas have sunk
 anuraag kashyap kii film 'udata punjab' ke promo main aap bhi tarantaaran kaa naam sunenge
 Five years before today, in the magazine Outlook, Chandrasuta Dogra writes that from the party office to the offices, the village chaupal, you will hear all the time that drug addiction is ending the youth of Punjab
 bibisi ne 2010 main punjab drugos mahamari par report kii he
 Chittiyan Kalaiyan Way, this song you heard some time back
 lekin yah chitta shabd nashe par bane geeton main aakar khataranaak ho jaataa he
 Chitta means white color
 heroin kaa powder bhi safed hota he isliye punjab main drugs ke liye chitta kaa istemaal hota he
 So Chitta Way is a song from Anurag Kashyap's film Udta Punjab and Chitta is also mentioned in the music video of Aam Aadmi Party leader Kumar Vishwas
 kumaar kaa video raajnneetik bhi he, sidhaa sidhaa badal sarkaar par hamalaa karata he
 This video has been viewed more than 11 lakh times with just one link on youtube
 anuraag kashyap kii film kaa gaanaa chitta ve ko 37 lakh se zyada baar dekha ja chukaa he
 These songs are definitely being talked about on the drug epidemic in Punjab these days, but the issue of addiction was also in 2012 when Rahul Gandhi said that 7 out of 10 people in Punjab are addicted
 tab akali dal ke netaa prakaash singh badal ne kaha tha ki hamaare yuvaaon kii chhavi bigaadane kii koshish he
 Rahul Gandhi should apologize to the youth of Punjab
 apane netaa ke bachaav main tab manish tiwari ne court main diya punjab sarkaar kaa hi halafanama pesh kiya tha ki punjab kaa 70 pratishat yuva nashe kaa shikaar he
 This affidavit was submitted by the BJP Akali government of Punjab
 9 june yani aaj hamaare sahyogi anand patel ne mohali main punjab ke swasthya mantri se baat kii
 He still has the same position then in 2012
 isi saal janvari main ol india medical science ne ek report prakashit kii thi
 This report says that no one has the exact number of people in Punjab who are addicted to drugs
 ames ne yah adhyayan bharat sarkaar ke samaaj kalyaan mantralay ke kehane par hi kiya tha
 Under this, a survey was conducted in ten districts of Punjab
 survey ke dauraan drugs ke shikaar 3620 yuvaaon se baatcheet kii gai to pataa chalaa ki 76 fisadi nashedi 18 se 35 saal ke hai
 99 percent of these are boys and 54 percent are married
 89 fisadi ladke padhe likhe hai or inamen se koi mazdoor kisaan he, sarkari karmchaaree he to bijnesaman he
 54 percent of addicts are living in villages
 survey ke anumaan ke anusaar kam se kam paune do lakh or adhik se adhik kareeb dhai lakh log nashe ke shikaar hai
 Heroin is most commonly used
 opium ke chure kaa bhi chalan he
 Recently you must have heard about the illegal cultivation of opium at the time of Malda dispute in Bengal
 heroin ke liye ek aadmi rose 1400 rupee kharch karata he
 The survey says that the young man from Punjab is spending Rs 20 crore every day on heroin and opium
 ek saal main drugs kaa anumaanit corobaar saadhe saat hazaar karod kaa he
 Where the drugs worth 20 crores are being sold daily, should we not know who is behind its network
 drugs kaa kaarobaar bina kisi sangathit giroh or sargana ke ho hi nahin saktaa he
 There have been political allegations at times
 inase bachane ke liye rajya sarkaar ne nashe ke kilaaf abhiyaan chalaane kaa bhi daawa kiya he
 These days Indian Express is continuously publishing reports on the narco war of Punjab
 is siries kii khaasiyat ye he ki aath maheene tak express ke samvaadadaataaon ne is par kaam kiya he
 In today's journalism, if you get to spend eight months working on all the aspects of a story, then you understand what will be its level
 ye main khaas taur se isliye bataa rahaa hum ki reporting band hoti ja rahi he
 Without reporting you cannot get the information of the correct facts

 The BBC reported on the Punjab drugs epidemic in 2010
 chittiyaan kalaaiyaan ve, ye gaanaa aapane kuch samay pehle suna tha
 But this Chitta word becomes dangerous in drunken songs
 chitta kaa matlab hota he safed rang
 Heroin powder is also white, so chitta is used for drugs in Punjab
 isliye anuraag kashyap kii film udata punjab kaa ek gaanaa he 'chitta ve' or aam aadmi party ke netaa kumaar vishwaas ke music video main bhi chitta kaa zikr he
 Kumar's video is also political, directly attacking Badal Sarkar

 Anurag Kashyap's film has been viewed more than 37 lakh times
 in gaanon ko lekar zarur in dinon punjab main nashe kii mahamari par baat ho rahi he magar nashe kaa mudda to 2012 main bhi tha jab rahul gandhi ne kaha tha ki punjab main 10 main se 7 log nashe kii chapet main hai
 Then Akali Dal leader Parkash Singh Badal had said that there is an attempt to spoil the image of our youth

 In defense of their leader, Manish Tiwari then submitted in the court the affidavit of the Punjab government itself that 70 percent of the youth of Punjab are drug addicts

 On 9 June, today our colleague Anand Patel spoke to the Punjab Health Minister in Mohali
 unki aaj bhi vahi pozishan he to 2012 main thi
 In January this year, All India Medical Science published a report
 is report main kaha gaya he ki punjab main kitne log nashe kii chapet main hai isaki sahi sahi sankhya kisi ke paas nahin he
 AIIMS did this study at the behest of the Ministry of Social Welfare, Government of India
 iske tahat punjab ke das zilon main survey hua
 During the survey, it was revealed that 3620 youths of drug addicts were in the age group of 18 to 35 years
 inamen se 99 fisadi ladke hai or 54 fisadi shaadishuda
 89 per cent of the boys are educated and any of these laborers are farmers, government employees and businessmen
 54 fisadi nashedi gaanvon main rahane vaale hai
 According to the estimate of the survey, at least twenty-two lakh people and more than two and a half lakh people are addicted
 sabase adhik heroin kaa istemaal hota he
 Poppy powder is also practiced
 abhi haal hi main aapane bengal ke malda vivaad ke samay opium kii avaidh kheti ke bare main suna hoga
 a man spends 1400 rupees a day for heroin

 The estimated turnover of drugs in a year is seven and a half thousand crores
 20 karod kii drugs rose jahaan bik rahi ho to kya hamen nahin jaananaa chahie ki iske network ke peeche koun he
 The business of drugs cannot take place without any organized gang and gangster

 To avoid these, the state government has also claimed to run a campaign against drugs
 in dinon indian express punjab ke narco waar par lagaataar report prakashit kar rahaa he

 It was found that 42 percent of the youth were arrested for possessing very few drugs

 If someone found a box of burned matches, he was also arrested and if he got a burnt silver foil from someone, he was also arrested
 express ke samvaadadaataaon apane adhyayan main paaya ki itane bade abhiyaan main 6000 se adhik log giraftaar kiye jate hai or unamem se ek bhi badi machhlee nahin he

 In the report published so far, there is no mention of arrest of anyone from any big place
 vakeelon ne express ke samvaadadaataaon se kaha he ki kisi sakasham agency se inaki giraftaar honi chahie
 Doctors say that those who have fallen into drug addiction are sick people
 unki jagah drugs ke sapliron ko pakadaa janaa chahie
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has mentioned drugs in Mann Ki Baat of December 2015

 Convicted of raping a woman by making false promises of marriage, a Delhi court has sentenced her to ten years of imprisonment
 aaropee par naram najariya apnaane se inkaar karte hue court ne kaha ki doshi ne peedit ko shaareerik, maansik or aarthik taur par barbaad kar diya he
 The court said that a straightforward woman handed over her body and money to the accused on the belief that he would become her life partner
 lekin vah doshi ke galat iraadon se puri tarah anjaan thi, jisane chal se uskaa phayda uthaaya
 Additional Sessions Judge Virender Bhatt said that from the family background of the accused's lawyer, i do not think that he should be generous in his favor
 uskaa aparaadh gambhir he
 He does not deserve leniency

 The accused has exploited the woman physically and financially with deceit

 Counsel for the accused had argued that the woman was married
 usko koi anya vyakti shaadi kaa jhansa de kar bahaka nahin saktaa tha
 Dismissing the argument, the court said that the woman had been living separately from her husband for 17 years

 kashmir main hinsa shuru hone baad jin galiyon main aaj naaron va goliyon kii gunj sunai detii he, kabhi vahaan hansi ke hasagulle chhutate the
 And, the reason was because of Nazir Josh, famously known as Charlie Chaplin of Kashmir, who used to flirt with laughter in Kashmiri houses as soon as he came on Doordarshan
 chehre ke haav-bhav main ghabrahat, gali ke joker jaise or chaal-dhaal main chaplin jaise josh ghati ko gudgudate the
 Growing up in an atmosphere of confrontation, the youth of today are witnessing violence and counter-violence, while the 67-year-old Comedy King of Kashmir says that humor is the only way to bring smiles and laughter on the faces of the Kashmiris
 kavi, lekhak, nirdeshak or abhinayta josh yahaan har ghar main 'juum german', 'ahed raja' or kai anya naamon se charchit hai jo kai tivi dharawahikon main unke kirdaaron ke naam rahe hai
 He regularly brought out comedy serials on local Doordarshan, which Kashmiris loved
 lekin, 1990 main jab algaavvaadi hinsa kashmir main bhadak uthi to unka kaarykram band ho gaya
 However, he received no direct threats but left no room for humor and satire in the violence in the valley and did not have sponsors
 josh kaa maananaa he ki kashmiri avam kai saamaajik va manovaigyanik samasyaon ke daur se guzar rahe hai jiskaa ilaaj sirf dawaaiyon se nahin ho saktaa he
 Josh said, "people here want to be relaxed and humor-humor and satire is a better way for it
 "jaane, kya he shani kaa rajyog or duryogunhone ek ghatana ke bare main bataaya jisamen ek parivaar ne apni avsaadagrast maa ko tanaav mukt karne ke liye unako dhanyavad diya tha
 He told, "the woman's son told me that after seeing a episode of the comedy serial 'hazar Dastan', her mother's face smiled after a long time
 "unhone kaha, "ladke ne bataaya ki maheenon avsaadagrast rahane ke baad uski maa ke hansane ke bare main jab manochikitsak ko maaloom hua to unhone kamedi dharawahik kii or kadiyaan dikhaane kii salaah di
 With this, she recovered completely
 "josh ko lagata he ki jahaan karfu, band or galiyon main hinsa koi asaadhaaran ghatana nahin balki aam baat ho vahaan logon kaa maansik santulan banaae rakhane ke liye unke jeevane main thode hasya-vinod kii jarurat hoti he
 However, as violence increased in the valley, there was no room for TV serials based on Nazir Josh's social and Rajit's satire
 jaane, apshabd bolne se kya padataa he aap par asarjosh madhya kashmir ke badgaam jila sthit apane ghar ke baahar badalon ko takataki nigahon se nihaarte hue josh ne bataaya ki saamaajik vyangy par aadhaarit unka antim dharawahik juum german 1989 main bana tha lekin kashmir main hinsa ke halaat paidaa hone ke baad yah 25 kadiyaan se zyada nahin chal paaya
 The faint rays of the winter sun are trying to make their way between the dense clouds, but the clouds stand as a barrier in their path to reach the earth

 There is no entertainment medium in Kashmir
 cinema haal band ho chuke hai
 There is no local film industry like other states
 "josh ne bataaya, "kashmir main sirf ek tivi stesan he or vahaan bhi manoranjan ke kaarykram shuru karne ke liye kuch nahin ho rahaa he jisase logon ko apni jindagi ke tanaav ko bhulaakar hansane kaa bahaanaa mili
 "he recalled the days when Kashmiris used to eagerly arrange weekly TV dramas
 josh ne bataaya, "main kuch sthaneey pariwaron ko jaanata hum jahaan mahilaon ne apane jevaraat bechakar tivi kharida tha taaki ve meri dharawahik hajaar daastaan dekh paaen
 52 episodes of the series ran on the local Doordarshan channel between 1985 and 1987
 "yah dharawahik pradesh kii satta par kabiz logon ke upar raajnneetik vyangy par aadhaarit tha, jisamen logon kii samasyaon ke prati unki berukhi va laaparvaahee kaa chithran kiya gaya tha
 He told, "some local leaders were angry about the serial's popularity
 unhone dilli jaakar kendriya netritv se shikaayat kii ki is dharawahik ko lekar unki sthiti asahaj ban gai he
 "every episode was sent to Delhi for previews, with a Kashmiri translator, after Josh complained, recalling his bygone days
" samiksha samiti ne raajnneetik va saamaajik vyangy ko sahi tehraaya or use protsaahan dene kii baat kahi
 "josh's professional life began with local theater
 unhone bataaya, "aarambh main ham gaanv or jila str par naatak khelte the
 i played a play in 1968 at Tagore Hall, Srinagar where the Natya Mahotsav was organized by the State Culture Academy
 "unhone 1973 main televijan ke liye 'hayer kekar' naatak likhaa
 He was enthused by its success and continued to write comedies until the 1989 ban on entertainment and comedy programs in Kashmir
 haalanki, vah halaat ke aage puri tarah se hatotsahit nahin hue hai
 He says that if his work is supported by the state and the central government, then even the satirical programs can be resumed in Kashmir
 josh ne kaha, "hamen kam se kam nirmaan laagat kii jarurat he taaki ateet kii garima phir se hasil ho
 i hope that a better understanding will be made in the near future and i will be able to relieve them of the daily stress by making Kashmiris laugh through TV serials
 "vah maanate hai ki sthaneey yuvaaon main kaaphi pratibha he
 He said, "these boys and girls of the new generation need hard training in acting and direction so that there is no omission of theater and TV serial here

 sapa main shaamil hone ke liye renu mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav se lekar party ke varisht netaa shivpal yadav tak se kai baar mulaakaat kar chuki hai
 Renu claims that he never committed any crime

 His father lodged an FIR with the police at that time, but the police did nothing in the case

 com / h7ksinnhaw — Hardik Patel (@hardikpatel_) November 30, 2017 Let us tell you that Patidar leader Hardik Patel on Wednesday burnt his electoral battle against BJP after formally announced to join Congress in the Gujarat assembly elections
 
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main pehle charan ke matdaan se pehle rajkot main hardik patel ne apni pehali badi chunavi sabha kii
 a large crowd gathered in the rally, about three thousand people attended this rally in Nana Mawa Chowk, Rajkot, in which the number of youth was very high
 buudhvaar ko hardik kii raily ko lekar yuvaaon main khaasaa utsaah dekhne ko mila or manch se gujarati main sambodhan hua
 People also sat on the tall buildings around Nana Mawa Chowk ground
 nishane par PM modiiske alaava hardik patel ne morabi main piem modi kii raily ko lekar nishaanaa saadhaa
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, he said that PM Modi has spoken very emotional
 hamaara kahana he ki yuvaaon kii baaten hon
 We will go from village to village and do well in the coming days
 hardik ne kaha ki modi ye bataaen ki piem banane ke baad unhone aakhir kya kiya? The geography of the capital city of Delhi has changed with the hoardings and posters of the assembly elections
 isi ke saath dilli metro ke bheetar ke kaanch ke frem main lage ‘dilli chale modi ke saath’ vaale naare or dibbon main hone vaali bahes kaa mood bhi badal gaya he
 After changing the current political idioms, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is deliberately or inadvertently changing the way the saffron party is governed
 rashtriya rajdhani main agle mukhyamantri ke chunaav kaa manch taiyaar hone ke saath hi shuruaati sanket utane hi saaf dekhe ja sakate hai, jitne ‘chalo chalem modi ke saath’ vaale poster dikhaai dete hai
 On January 13, three weeks before the end of the election campaign, a top BJP leader indicated the time to come
 dilli main unhone kaha tha ki paaramparik rang-dhang or tareekon ke saath hi puraane dharre ke netaaon kaa jamaana ab lad gaya
 He had said, "the urban cosmopolitan voter is now looking for faces with more modern looks and style
 ham ise andekha nahin kar sakate
 The secret of his talk came two days later, when the former athlete, angry over not being made Delhi's police commissioner, took VRS from IPS, social activist, anti-corruption Lokpal warrior of Anna Hazare's team and Modi style Kiran Bedi, who exclaimed a lot, addressed the media with BJP President Amit Shah one afternoon
 aadhikarik elaan kar diya gayaru bedi bijepi main shaamil ho gai hai
 On January 19, Shah announced that the party's parliamentary board has decided to make Bedi the bjp's chief ministerial candidate
 is faisle kaa yah bhi matlab he ki bedi bharat kii bhagava raajnneeti ke itihaas main mukhyamantri pad kii pehali ummidavaar hongi, or isse fark nahin padataa ki ve shyama prasad mukherjee kii vichaardhaara or deen dayaal upaadhyaay ke ‘ekatm maanavtawaad’ ke darshan se bakhubi parichit na hon
 So how did the picture of Delhi change so fast that BJP state president Satish Upadhyay, Union minister Harshvardhan, Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Goel and senior party leader Jagdish Mukhi suddenly started appearing soot-less? If the party had continued the same straight line as before, then any one of these four leaders could have been the chief ministerial candidate
 dilli ke chunaav prabandhan se jude bijepi ke ek kendriya netaa bedi ko party main laane ke bare main kehete hai, “jamini str par haalat behad kharaab he
 "at the same time, an RSS pracharak, who recently completed two weeks of study in Delhi to fathom the general public before the election, says," People have become disenchanted with local leaders
 iske ulat kejariwal kaa netritv logon ko zyada aakarshak dikhaai detaa he
 "BJP leaders also say that the less than expected crowd at Modi's Ramlila Maidan rally on January 10 proved to be the turning point
 jab koi chaara na rahaa, to shah ne chunaav prabandhan se jude aresas prachaarkon se feedback maanga
 He cracked the whip in the meetings of booth-level workers and issued a decree that put full force and go door-to-door in the style of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)
 bedi ko laane kaa faisla pehali najar main aap ke chunavi josh main send lagane kaa pintara dikhaai detaa he
 There was no clean, credible face from the BJP as the Chief Ministerial candidate and the Congress is almost in a state of cleanliness
 aise main arvind kejariwal kii lokapriyata par savaar aap ko badhat milti dikhaai de rahi thi
 Even your insiders believe that he was taken aback by this incident
 kejariwal ne jarur magsese puraskaar vijeta apni saathi kaa raajnneeti main aane kaa swaagat kiya, lekin party ne bahut sadhi hui pratikriya di, kyonki isse uske kuch sameekaran pakke taur par gadabada gaye
 The same day earlier, Kejriwal had accused Upadhyay of indulging in wrongdoing and claimed that he was in collusion with the power companies as the owner of the electric meter installation company
 aagaaj to ho gaya, aage kya?bijepi netaa kehete hai ki shuruaati dikkaton ke baavjood chijen sudharti dikhaai de rahi hai
 Bedi initially got into a bit of trouble by rejecting Kejriwal's proposal of a debate between the chief ministerial candidates on the lines of the US presidential election
 yahi nahin, ve ek news channel kaa intervyuu adhuraa chhodkar bich main hi chali gayi
 On the other hand, supporters of some leaders, who were not getting tickets, protested in front of BJP headquarters
 or yah sab namakan daakhil karne kii aakhri taarikh se ek din pehle 20 janvari ko hua
 Says a BJP leader, “bringing Bedi has instilled a sense of confidence among ordinary party workers
 ” ve bataate hai ki party ke rashtriya mahasachiv (sanghathan) raamalaal, bedi ke aane ke baad pratikriyaaon par najar rakhe hai
 Whatever the immediate reaction, a long-standing pattern of the saffron party has been broken with the introduction of Bedi
 party main aguwai vaale pad—jab satta main hon to mukhyamantri kaa pad or jab vipaksh main hon to netaa virdohi dal kaa pad—bahari netaaon ko mushkil se hi saunpe jate the
 Leaders brought into the party were assigned subordinate responsibilities, but were never given the leadership chair
 yah congress ke ekadam ulat he, jo dashakon ke dauraan alag-alag vichaaron, siddhanton or vichaardhaaraon kaa mishran ban gai he
 But for BJP, elevating Bedi, a former IPS officer, means that the cadre-run party is trying to transform itself into a mass-based organization while retaining its original character
 bedi kii ummidavaari kaa elaan karte hue shah ne asal main isaki taraf ishaara bhi kiya
 He declared that the BJP has launched a tremendous campaign to make people from every section a member and these newcomers will have to give their right and place in the party
 bedi ko mukhyamantri ummidavaar banaakar party kaaryakartaaon ko saaf sanket diya gaya he ki agar aap main nai peedi ke hytech or apni pasand badalane main vakt na lagane vaale matadaata kaa dil jeetne kaa madda he to netritv kii baaki sharton main dheel di ja sakati he
 In the context of Delhi, this is the end of the politics of leaders like Kedar Nath Sahni, Madan Lal Khurana and Sahib Singh Verma, in which identity politics dominated the urban appeal
 inhen agraj netaaon se siyaasi gur seekhney vaale or unki kaman sanbhaalane vaale harshavardhan, goyal or mukhi sareekhe tamaam netaaon ko iske jariye aagaah kar diya gaya he
 This does not mean that the party has lost its traditional political mobilization
 lekin party dilli ke bahaane shaharikaran kii taraf bad rahe baaki rajyon ko bhi sanket de rahi he ki nae jamaane main nae kism kaa netaa chalegaa

 Front opened in both houses of parliament against Chidambaram

 rajyasabha main is mudde ko lekar bhaajapa sadasyon ke hangaame ke chalate bhojanavkaash ke pehle kii kaarywahi sthagit kar di gai
 After this, the house was adjourned twice and then for the whole day
 bhaajapa sadsy chandan mitra ne shoonyakaal main yah mudda uthaaya, jiskaa party ke anya sadasyon or ol india anna dravid munetra kadgam (ediemke) ke saansadon ne bhi samarthan kiya
 Deputy Speaker Rehman Khan asked the members of the opposition party to sit on their seats, but they remained adamant that the Prime Minister would come to the House and inform them what action he was going to take against Chidambaram on the said charges
 bhaajapa sadasyon ke shant na hone par sadan kii kaarywahi do baje tak sthagit kar di gai
 After this, when the proceedings of the House resumed, there was an uproar among the BJP members demanding action on Chidambaram, which led to the first proceedings of the House
 30 baje tak or phir teen baje or antat: puure din ke liye sthagit kar di gai
 BJP leader Venkaiah Naidu later told reporters that what action Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is going to take in this 'clear case of conflict of interest', he should clarify it
 naidu ne kaha, "yah ek vyaktigat maamla nahin he, balki pad ke durupyog kaa maamla he
 The Prime Minister should take action

 As soon as Chidambaram started answering a question asked by Congress's Meenakshi Natarajan on human trafficking, opposition mps led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stood up from their seats and raised slogans against them
 chidambaram jab bhi maanav taskari or rashtriya khufia grid tathaa rashtriya aatankwaad nivarak centre kii sthapana kii maujuuda sthiti jaise muddon par prashnon ke jawaab dene ke liye uthe, vipakshi saansadon ne shorsharaba kiya or narebaaji kii
 But Chidambaram continued his response regardless of these situations
 yah alag baat he ki shorsharabe ke kaaran unhen sun paanaa kathin tha
 Apart from this, BJP also proposed a breach of privilege against the Union Home Minister
 'hit ke sangharsh' ke aaropon par apana bayaan sansad ke baahar dene par bhaajapa ne yah prastaav chidambaram ke khilaaf laayaa he
 After a meeting of the party's parliamentary board headed by senior BJP leader LK Advani, Yashwant Sinha gave notice to Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar

 a BJP member SS Ahluwalia told reporters that the notice was related to the 'disrespect' being shown by the Union Home Minister towards Parliament
 vah baahar bayaan de rahe hai, jabaki sansad kaa satr chal rahaa he
 At the same time, Chidambaram dismissed the bjp's allegation that he had helped his former client hotelier SP Gupta

" *** Mahendra Singh Dhoni's decision to hand over the last over to David Hussey in a tense moment proved to be wrong as Royal Challengers Bangalore retained their hopes of reaching the play-offs of IPL 7 by defeating Chennai Super Kings by five wickets amidst the dominance of spinners here today 
 bangalore ke saamne keval 139 ran kaa lakshya tha lekin chennai ke spinneron ke saamne uske ballebaajon ke liye ran bananaa mushkil ho gaya
 In the final over, Bangalore needed ten runs
 aise main dhoni ne hasi ko gend saunpi jin par yuvaraj singh (naabad 13) ne chakka or nae ballebaaj abu naachim ne vijayi chaukaa jadkar is utaar chadhaav vaale match kaa ant kiya
 Dhoni won the toss and decided to bat first but his team could manage 138 runs for four wickets
 suresh raina ne 48 gendon par chah chaukon or ek chakke kii madad se naabad 62 ran banaae
 He shared a 75-run 59-ball partnership with Hussey for the third wicket
 ipel 7 main apana pehla match khel rahe hasi ne 29 gendon par 25 ran banaae
 The pitch was not only playing slow but also taking spin
 bangalore ke ballebaajon ke liye ran bananaa aasaan nahin tha
 Only 17 runs were scored in the power play and Chris Gayle, who remained in the 17th over, was able to score 46 runs off 50 balls
 viraat kohli (29 gend par 27 ran) kaa strike rate bhi 100 se kam rahaa lekin abi divilliars ne teen chakke jade or 14 gend par 28 ran banaae
 Eventually Yuvraj played his role well
 bangalore kii yah 11wein match main paanchavin jeet he jisase uske das ank ho gayi hai or vah ankatalika main paanchaven sthaan par pahunch gaya he
 Chennai, ranked second, is their third defeat in 11 matches

 Hussey however 2
 5 over main 38 ran lutaa gaye jisase antar paidaa hua
 Varun Aaron was the most successful bowler for Bangalore
 unhone teen over main 29 ran dekar do wicket liye lekin uske baaki gendbaajon abu naachim (18 ran dekar ek wicket), mishael stark, muthaiya muralidharan (29 ran dekar ek wicket) or yajuvendra chahal ne ballebaajon par ankush lagaaye rakhaa
 Battered batsmen in powerplaysbangalore batsmen had to face the spin of Badri and Ashwin in the powerplay
 mohit ke pehle over main parthiv patel (10) ne do chauke jade lekin iske baad powerple ke agle paanch overon main keval saat ran bane
 This is the lowest score in Powerplay in IPL 7
 is bich aswin ne parthiv ko slip main raina ke haathon kaich bhi karaayaa
 Ashwin became an unknown puzzle for Gayle
 unhone powerple ke baad hamawatan badri par midwicket par pari kaa pehla chakka lagaaya, lekin pehle das over main score 45 ran tak hi pahunch paaya jo chennai se das ran kam tha
 The pressure on the batsmen was increased and in such a situation, Dhoni was easily stumped out by Kohli, who proceeded to hit a big hit on the ball taking Jadeja's turn
 gail ne jadeja ke isi over main pehle chaukaa or phir long on par chakka lagaaya
 De Villiers also sent Hussey for six runs
 teen over main keval teen ran!aswin ne apane pehle teen over main keval teen ran die the lekin unka aakhri over mahangaa sabit hua
 De Villiers and Gayle hit sixes in this over but he was successful in bowling the Caribbean batsman
 divilliars bhi hasi par chakka or chaukaa jadne ke baad pavilion laute
 Finally, despite Badri's over, the decision to hand the ball to Hussey did not prove right and Challengers 19
 5 over main paanch wicket par 142 ran banane main safal rahe
 Earlier, Brandon mccullum (19) and Dwayne Smith (9) failed to give Chennai the expected start
 aaron ne in donon ko teen gend ke andar out karke chennai ko sankat main daal diya tha

 These teachers also include the name of Ashish of a Gurugram, who travels from Gurgaon to Uttarakhand every week to teach village children

 ye sab dekhne ke baad ashish ne apane gaanv ke paas main hi apane rishtedaaron kii madad se ek computer centre khol diya or naam rakhaa 'da universal gurukul'
 In this center, children from Timli and nearby areas come to learn computers
 ashish ke liye computer centre kholana itnaa aasaan nahin tha
 He raised money to open the center and changed many jobs
 iske baad apni patni or bhai kii madad se computer centre shuru kiya
 He shifted to Gurgaon in the year 2013 and from 2014 the Computer Center started

 rahul gandhi ‘gujarat mishan’ ke aakhri charan main koi kasar nahin chhodana chaahate
 On Wednesday, he bowed at Somnath temple and on Thursday, he will decide the distance of 120 km for the promotion of Congress candidates in Gujarat
 rahul ne tay kiya he ki naa to wo pradhanmantri narendra modi ke jubaani waar par palatwaar karenge or naa hi apane dharm ko lekar uthe vivaad par koi pratikriya vyakt karenge
 In contrast, Rahul is not leaving any scope to surround PM Modi with the 'gujarat model of development'
 iske liye tikhi bhashaa kaa istemaal karne se bhi gurej nahin kar rahe
 People now listen to Rahulkhud in a question-and-answer manner

 Gherrahaul said to PM Modi on the Gujarat model, in this fashion, 'everybody is agitating in Gujarat
 kuch log andolan isliye nahin karte kyonki hawaii jahaaj main udate hai or ve modi ji ke mitra he
 These are people whose women were not beaten in their homes
 un par goli nahin chalaai gai
 Runs at you
 modi ji ke kehane par sab hota tha
 Rahul targeted BJP president Amit Shah and said that Gujarat is running the same
 vijay rupani ji to amit shah ke remote par chal rahe hai, jab chaahe channel badal dete hai
 He told the Congress that the welfare of the farmers raised the issue of the welfare of the farmers
 rahulne moongfalee, kapaas or anya kisaanon ke dard kaa zikr karte hue kaha, modi khud to pradhanmantri ban gaye par abhi tak unhone nunatam samarthan mulya nahin diya
 Rahul said, 'what is the price of groundnut, the Congress party used to give 1000 rupees
 abhi aapako kya mil rahaa he 500 rupye
 Modi ji promised 1500 rupees
 yahi kapaas kaa haal he
 Coming here, Modi ji said that make me the Prime Minister of the country, i will give you 2000 rupees of cotton
 par aisa kuch nahin hua, modi ji apane bhaashan main yah kyon nahin kehete hai
 "demonetisation made black money of thieves" While referring to note ban, Rahul Gandhi alleged that the Prime Minister has made black money of all thieves white
 notebandi main puure desh ko line main laga diya
 As soon as he spoke on black money, Rahul asked the people, did you get 15 lakh rupees? Rahul accused of massive corruption in Gujarat
 rahul ne kaha, ‘aap bataao kya gujarat main koi kaam bina bhrashtachar ke hota he? bhrashtachar kaa model he ye
 Can you send children to college without bribing? However, Amit Shah's son Jai Shah converted only 50 thousand rupees into 80 thousand crores, then closed the company and PM Modi is silent

 The first reason for this is Jai Shah
 modi nahin chaahate ki gujarat chunaav se pehle jai shah par baat ho
 The second reason is the Rafale deal
 raksha mantri goa main machhlee kharidne main vyast or piem modi ne france jaakar deal badal di
 Modi ji gave a contract to Ambani, who never built a ship
 kya cabinet cameti se kabhi poocha? haa yaa naa? 'rahul kaa guuruuvaar ko gujarat main amarelli, botad or bhavnagar jilon main kaarykram he

 pir baba kii majaaron par to hindu bhi har saal lakhon kii sankhya main akidat ke phool chadhaane jate hai

 It is said that while living in Udaipur near his maternal uncle, he had also performed a ritual with the Paliwal Brahmins to appease the Devas, the destroyer and provider of Riddhi-siddhi
 jab padosi rajyon or maratha shaasha holkar ke sahyog se maadho singh ne jaipur par hamalaa kiya or vijay praapt kii to ganeshji kii murti jaipur laai gai
 According to the transport means of that time, the Ganesh statue in the bull of the bulls reached Jaipur after traveling for many months
 isi tarah udaipur kaa eklingaji mandir bhi sabase pracheen dharmik kendron main se ek he, jo mukhya shahar se lagbhag 24 kimi kii duuri par sthit he
 The temple is dedicated to the Hindu deity Shiva
 lagbhag 2,500 varg foot ke ek kshetra main faile is mandir parisar main 108 mandir hai
 The second famous Govind Devji Temple is dedicated to the Hindu god Lord Krishna
 is mandir main rakhi murti pehle vrundavan ke ek mandir main thi, jise jaipur ke raja savai jai singh dwitiya ne apane parivaar ke devtaa ke rup main is mandir main punasrthapit kiya tha

 Union Minister M
 venkaiya naidu ne congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi se kaha ki ve saaf bataayen ki desh main kalaadhan he yaa nahin or usase nipatane kii jarurat he yaa nahin
 Naidu told journalists that in such a situation when 'foundation Day of Congress' has been celebrated, the truth is that issues of black money, corruption etc
 are still chasing this party
 naidu ne kaledhan or bhrashtachar ke bare main rahul gandhi se paanch sawaal kiye hai
 He said that Rahul Gandhi with his smile and physical gesture on Wednesday gave a 'hint' that there is not much black money in the country
 naidu ne kaha, ‘main shri rahul ji se poochna chaahunga ki vah saahas jutakar yah khule taur par kahen ki kya unki party kaa akalan yah he ki hamaari arthvyavastha main bahut adhik kalaadhan nahin he
 He said that everyone knows the close connection between black money and corruption, but if the Congress party says that there is no black money in our economy, then surely there is no place for corruption in our system
 ’unhone sawaal kiya, ‘kya congress kaa yahi ruukh he
 He said that Congress is nervous due to the support the Prime Minister is receiving from the public and wants to create confusion
 unhone kaha ki congress ko yah chintaa he ki rahul ko koi bhi gambhirtha se nahin le rahaa he, chaahe khud congress ke log hon yaa vipakshi netaa
 Question 1 by Rahul Gandhi of Venkaiah Naidu
 kya congress yah maanati he ki desh main koi kalaadhan nahin ?2
 If the Congress believes that there is black money in the country, why has it not taken any effective steps to curb it? 3

 The Prime Minister referred to the Naxal attack on Congress leaders and activists in Chhattisgarh recently in the Chief Ministers Conference on Internal Security here, saying that such violence has no place in our democracy
 kendra or rajyon ko saath milakar kaam karne kii aavashyaktaa he taaki sunishchit ho sake ki is tarah kii ghatana phir se na hone paye
 He said that in the last two years the number of incidents of Naxal violence and deaths in it has come down significantly
 naksaliyon ke aatmasamarpan ke maamalon main bhi badhotaree darj kii gayi he lekin chhattisgarh hamale jaise naksaliyon ke bade hinsak hamale hamaare liye jhatka hai
 The Center and states must work together to deal with such attacks on a large scale

 Singh drew attention to two more issues regarding internal security
 ye sampradayik hinsa or mahilaon evam bacchon par aparaadh hai
 He said that in 2012, there was an increase in incidents of communal violence compared to 2011
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki is baat se sabhi sahamat honge ki satat vikaas or sampannataa ke liye hamaare desh main sampradayik sadbhaav banaaye rakhana kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 In such a situation, it is necessary to strictly deal with all types of communal forces

 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne haal hi main mahilaon or bacchon ke prati hone vaale aparaadhon se nipatane ke liye kade dandatmak praavdhaan karne vaale kanoon lagu kiye hai
 He said that there is a need to put in place an institutional mechanism that can ensure the safety of women and children, especially the safety of children and women living in cities
 inamen police ko mahilaon or bacchon ke prati samvedansheel bananaa, samarpit helpline lagaana, kaarysthal par suraksha aadi shaamil hai
 Expressing his commitment to assist the states in the task of police modernization and capacity development, Singh said that the state police modernization scheme has been given a five-year extension and an outlay of Rs 12000 crore
 kolkata, chennai, mumbai, bangalore, ahmedabad or hyderabad main mega city policing ke liye 433 crores rupee atirikt muhaiyaa karaaye gayi hai
 Stressing the need for better coordination between central and state agencies to tackle terrorism and other security challenges, Singh urged the Chief Ministers to find out how better coordination can be established between the Center and the States
