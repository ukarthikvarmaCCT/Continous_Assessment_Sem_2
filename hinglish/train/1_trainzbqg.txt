 But now there is neither Baba's mask on his face nor the crowd of devotees whose innocence he had cheated around
 ab bas kuch he to jail kii patharilii farsh or jism par kaidi number 1997 kii vardi
 Gurmeet ram-rahim Insan has once again been convicted by the court for refusing to be considered a human
 balaatkaari to khayr wo pehle hi se tha
 So here is the whole story of a Baba from rapist to murderer
 apane dere main sadhviyon se balaatkaar ke maamle main jail kii chakki pis rahe hero heeralaal baba ram rahim ko apane kiye kaa ek or inaam mila he
 Now Baba has become a killer as well as a rapist
 ye vahi hero heeralaal baba hai jo kabhi khud ko multi talented bataate the, to kabhi bhagwaan
 From spirituality to films, he brought revolution in every skill
 or filmon main bhi baba sirf hero nahin bane, balki diarector, sangeetkaar, lekhak, geetkaar, cinemetographer, dress diziner, yani ol in van the baba
 All-in-one Maula Ram Rahim made such a flow of money with every fun and pretense that he created a whole elusive world around him
 deraa pramukh shah satnam singh ne saat saal ke gurmeet singh ko jab ram rahim kaa naam dekar use apana deraa saunpa tha
 Then he too could not have guessed that his disciple would be able to ship the camp's dainty with hypocrisy
 or us par aadhyatm kii nahin ayyashi kii ibaarat likhegaa
 Baba Ram Rahim became the first Baba of India who changed everyone's thinking about Babas that Baba can wear such clothes too
 baba aise gaadiyaan bhi chalaa sakate hai
 Baba can also do such stunts
 baba aise naach bhi sakate hai
 Baba can also sing like this
 baba ye bhi kar sakate hai
 Baba can do that too
 yahaan tak ki baba mahal ke andar gupha bhi bana sakate hai
 And in those caves, Baba can also put soot on the mouth of the faith of the Sadhvis
 sirsa ke dere main baba gurmeet ram rahim kii ek gupha he, jahaan wo sadhviyon ko apni havas kaa shikaar banaaya karata tha
 And today he is facing the punishment of his own misdeeds in jail
 ye gupha baba ne apane dere main gupt rup se kai barason se bana rathi thi
 Then no one could understand what Baba's tilism was
 wo gupha main karata kya tha
 In fact, Baba and his honey had created a cycle around this mystery
 jo baahar se dekhne main maamuli tha magar jaise jaise koi andar aata jaataa tha, wo is chakravyuuh main fansata chalaa jaataa
 Those who were servants were also caught in it
 wo bhi jo vafaadaar the
 She also used to study
 wo bhi jo padhaati thim
 Even those who were ill
 wo bhi jo timaardaar the
 Those who were relatives and also those who were knowledgeable
 kul milakar is rahasyalok ke chakravyuuh se do hi log mahfuz the
 The one who made it
 yani baba gurmeet ram rahim
 And the other one that enticed people into it
 yani baba kii haniprit
 The rest were all pieces
 jinhen wo ungaliyon par nachaate the or wo ishaaron par naachte the
 This is only one aspect of Baba's mystery
 ranginmizaaji ke alaava bhi baba ke kukarmon kii fehrist bahut lambii he
 The colorful clothes of the Baba, which should be given life in a pair of clothes
 sone sa mahal or mahangi mahangi gadiyaan ye bina bole hi bataa dengi ki is baba kii niyat main khot he
 The mystery of Baba was not only filled with colors and richness, but his servants tell that there are screams of helpless sadhus in its walls
 ise begunaahon ke khoonon se sincha gaya he
 But that was the rule in Baba's mystery
 vahi khuda tha
 But he also knew the path he was on
 ek naa ek din uskaa anjaam bura hone vaala he or vahi hua

 alaska main america ke mul nivaasiyon kii puraani maang puri karte hue raashtrapati baraak obama ne uttari america main sthit sabase oonche parvat kaa naam mount mekinale se badalakar denali rakhane kaa faisla kiya he
 Before the Obama visit, the White House said on the eve of Obama's Alaskadoure that the president had decided to rename Mount Mackinlay to Denali
 obamlaska daure ke samay is nirnay ke sambandh main aupchaarik ghoshnaa karenge
 Such was the name Mount mckinley In 1896, a man searching for minerals in the mountains of central Alaska received information that William mckinley had been named a candidate for the US presidential election
 unke samarthan main us vyakti ne alaska parvatiy shrinkhalaa kii sabase unchi chotii kaa naam mount mekinale rakh diya
 Thus the name of this peak was Mount Mackinlay
 america ke 25wein raashtrapati bane the mekinalemacinale america ke 25wein raashtrapati bane lekin raashtrapati ke taur par unke duusare kaarykaal ke maatr chah maheene baad unki hatya ho gai thi
 The White House said, but he never ventured into Alaska, and the tallest in North America and located about 20,000 feet above sea level, the peak has been known for centuries by the name Denali
 usne kaha, 1975 main alaska rajya dwaara shuru kii gai prakriya ko antim rup dete hue raashtrapati obama ghoshnaa kar rahe hai ki grih mantri saili jevel ne apane adhikaar kaa prayog karte hue parvat kaa naam denali rakh diya he
 The old name is Denialiselli said, Alaska has been using this name officially since 1975, but more importantly, it has been known as Denali for generations
 input: bhashaa Patna High Court has canceled the membership of BJP MP from Sasaram Chedi Paswan
 paswan par aarope he ki unhone chunaav ke samay die halafname main apane kuch aapraadhik ricard chipa liye hai
 a single bench of the High Court gave this decision while hearing a PIL
 sasaram loksabhaa kshetra ke ek voter ganga mishra ne yachika main aarope lagaaya tha kichhedi paswan ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main die gaye halafname main apane kuch aparadhik ricard ko jaahir nahin kiya he
 Justice KK Mandal ordered the cancellation of the Lok Sabha membership of Chedi Paswan after the completion of the hearing
 court ne nahin maani daleel2014 ke halafname main chhedi paswan ne jinapradhik ricardkee jaankaree nahin di thi, usamen ek road jam karne or doosraa railway stesan par poster lagane kaa maamla tha
 Chedi Paswan's lawyer argued that in these cases he is not a convict nor a charge sheet has been filed
 lekin court ne unki daleelon ko nahin mana or sadsyta radd kar di
 Meera Kumarasingal Bench was defeated by Chedi This decision can be challenged in the double bench of the High Court or it can be challenged in the Supreme Court
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main chhedi paswan ne congress kii ummidavaar or purv loksabhaa adhyaksh mira kumaar ko haraaya tha
 Chhedi Paswan, who was in the BJP before the Lok Sabha elections, was elected as a member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly in 1985 for the first time on a Lok Dal ticket
 1996 main loksabhaa ke chunaav main chhedi paswan bijepi ke munilaal se haar gaye

 2014 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle chhedi paswan 1989 or 1991 main sansad sadsy nirvaachit hue the
 Just before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Chedi Paswan resigned from JDU and joined BJP
 bollywood main kabhi-kabhi filmkaaron or actors se film banane main galtiyaan ho jaati hai or unheen galatiyon main se ek he arjuna patiala
 When this film was made, did you think the audience would be happy, appreciate it? No, no brother
 darshak yahaan cinema haul main baithkar ubaasiyaan le rahe hai or apane aap ko jhapakiyaan lene se roak rahe hai
 Waiting that maybe something good will happen, something fun will happen
 lekin afsos ant tak aisa hua nahin
 Right now, if there is a shortcoming in the film, i would ignore it, but here the entire film has gone out of the way, so what to do? Well, the film Arjun talks about Patiala
 mujhe ye bataane main kaaphi uljhan ho rahi he ki film kii kahani aakhir he kya
 Because there is no story of the film
 kahin se bhi, kuch bhi, ho rahaa he or soch rahe hai bhai kya ho rahaa he? film kii shuruyaat hoti he ek diarector or riter kii baatcheet se
 The director asks the writer what the story of the film he has brought
 riter ek-ek karke bataata he ki uski kahani main item song, 4 villen, hero or heroin hai or sani leyoni ko wo isamen kahin naa kahin feet kar legaa
 The director gets happy after hearing this and announces the preparations for making the film
 lekin riter chahta he ki uski kahani ko ek baar sun liya jaae
 So he celebrates the director and this is just what Torture starts with
 to riter kii film kii kahani shuru hoti he arjuna patiala (dilajit dosanjh) se jo judo karata he or pulisavaala bananaa chahta he
 Arjun has grown up since childhood watching IPS Amarjeet Singh Gill (ronit Roy) and wants to be like him
 arjuna judo compitishan jeetta he or uski posting firozabad police chaowkee main ho jaati he
 Now the condition of Firozabad Police Outpost is no less than a dime
 matlab is chaowkee main sahi main ek victoria naam kii bhens bandhi he, jisapar munshi onida (varun sharma) ko krash he

 is chor police ke khel se pehle arjuna shahar kii patrkaar ritu randhaava ke pyaar main pad jate hai
 Arjun has the responsibility of eradicating crime from the city on his shoulders and for this he has to do his job with a lot of mind
 saath hi use apni lav story ko bhi bachaana or aage badhanaa he
 As i told earlier, the story of the film is nothing special
 ise agar dhang se likhaa jaataa to shaayad kuch ho saktaa tha, lekin kahani agar darshakon ko samaj hi naa aae to phir kya phayda
 The film starts from somewhere and in the middle you feel that if you did not make it, there was no loss but you would have avoided loss
 kahani to najuk thi hi saath hi actors kii parformens ne bhi niraash kiya
 The film stars Diljit Dosanjh, Kriti Sanon and Varun Sharma in the lead roles
 arjuna patiala ke role main dilajit dosanjh ne acha kaam kiya
 Not so good that you can praise them, but they were right to bear
 kriti senon kaa 'bareli kii barfi' vaala hangover kab jayega ye samajhnaa thodaa mushkil he
 Seeing every scene of her, you will miss Barfi of the film Bareilly
 varun sharma bhi kuch khaas nahin the
 Their dialogue is a different way of playing, which is quite fun
 bas uske alaava unki parformens main kuch khaas nahin he
 Ronit Roy disappointed in the role of IPS Gill
 ronit roy industry ke badhiya actors main se ek hai or unka ye chota sa role karnaa bhi kaaphi khatak rahaa he
 Apart from this, the film stars Seema Pahwa, Sunny Leone and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayub, who have done well
 film kaa ek bhi kirdaar aap apane saath ghar lekar nahin aate
 You look at them and forget
 iske alaava film main chemiyo achche the
 Pankaj Tripathi as director and Abhishek Banerjee as writer were very good
 diarector rohit jugraj ne is film ko bollywood ke hisaab se banaaya hi nahin he
 Rohit, who has given good films like Sardar Ji and Sardar Ji 2 to the Punjabi film industry, could not handle this film to a great extent
 dilajit dosanjh or rohit jugraj kii hit jodi ko jahaan film arjuna patiala se kamaal karnaa tha vahiin inaki jodi hi taay taay fish ho gai
 Some of the film's dialogues and jokes are good
 film main fan eliments khub daale gaye hai, jo kahin kahin aapako hansaate hai
 Some sequences of the film are also good
 lekin iske alaava aisa kuch bhi nahin he, jise aap dekhnaa chahenge
 This film of just 1 hour and 47 minutes makes you feel so long that you start coming out of the theater

 He said, 'this fight is for our existence and principles

 He also said that because of the border of Afghanistan, extremist attacks are very much here and the militants want to target the world too, but first they will attack us

 On Friday, pollution has gone above a very dangerous level, but how serious are the officials and leaders about pollution, you can guess from this that no one is allowed to come to the meeting of the Parliamentary Committee of the Ministry of Urban Development regarding pollution
 Found, due to which the meeting had to be canceled
 shuukravaar ko dilli ke dwarka ilaake main hawa kii gunvattta kaa str 900 ke bhi paar pahunch gaya yani dilli gas chembar ban chuki he
 But who is worried about Delhi people forced to breathe poisonous air? The meeting was called by the Municipal Development Ministry regarding pollution
 lekin is baithak ko kuch minuton main hi khatm karnaa padaa
 Neither the MP nor the officials reached the meeting
 29 main se sirf 5 saansad hi baithak main pahunche
 The environment secretary and the forest secretary, who were specially called at the meeting, also did not arrive

 The committee's chief MP Jagdambika Pal, angered, said that he would complain to the Lok Sabha speaker about this

 ab se thik do maheene pehle kii baat he
 The Rajasthan police was wandering from rate to rate, but Asaram was not taking the name of the hand
 tab isi vaardaat main hamane aapako asaram ko ek alag rup main dikhaaya tha or phir iske do din baad hi police kaa intjaar khatm ho gaya
 Asaram was caught and since then he is in jail as a government guest
 ye to rahi baap kii baat
 Now watch the game of time
 baap jail gaye to bete ne kaman sanbhali
 His father is innocent by trying to turn around
 unhen fansaaya ja rahaa he
 Then he even came to the office to give cleaning
 par tab tak shaayad narayan sai ko andaja nahin tha ki bahut jald thik wo sab kuch unke saath bhi hone vaala he jo abhi tak unke pita ke saath hua tha
 Like the father, he will be charged in the same way
 pita kii tarah unke khilaaf bhi mukadmaa darj hoga or phir pita kii tarah hi khud unhen bhi police se bhaagna padegaa or khud pita kii tarah hi police ko unka bhi intazaar karnaa padegaa
 But like the father, now it is really too late for the son
 kanoon se bhaagate-bhaagate narayan sai itani dur nikal gaye ki unhen waapas laane ke liye ab gaiyr-jamaanti warrant kaa sahaara lenaa pad rahaa he
 That is, the wait is not over now that the jail is fixed
 kya karen duusari koi surat chodi hi nahin sai ne
 For more than twenty days, the court has obtained a non-bailable warrant against the same Narayan Sai, who was not looking for the Narayan Sai Surat Police
 yani isse pehle lukout notice lekar narayan sai ko dhundh rahi police unhen poochtacha ke baad raahat bhi de sakati thi, lekin police se bhaagate narayan sai ne apane haathon se wo mauka bhi ganvaa diya
 This means that now when Narayan Sai and the police are face to face, then he will have the same meaning only and that instead of Narayan Sai, his father Asaram will be behind bars
 surat kii do bahanon ne narayan sai or unke pita asaram ke khilaaf balaatkaar kii report likhavai thi
 Asaram had already been arrested by the Rajasthan police in a sexual abuse case, the Gujarat Police completed his interrogation with him on transit remand but it was one day and one today
 narayan sai kaa intazaar kar rahi gujarat police ko naakaami hi haath lagi
 Surat police kept on locating Narayan Sai's location everywhere, moving around with a lookout notice
 railway stesan or hawaii addon par munaadi karwaati rahi lekin narayan police kii tamaam koshishon ko chakma dete hue berok-tok kabhi rajasthan, kabhi gujarat, kabhi empi or kabhi dilli kii dooriyaan napate rahe or police ko yahaan tak pataa chal gaya ki narayan sai police ko dhokhaa dene kii koshish main har roj nae sim kaa istemaal kar rahe hai or unhen tod rahe hai, lekin itnaa hone ke baavjood police narayan sai tak nahin pahunch saki
 However, this happened to the Surat Police, when she was earlier saying that Narayan Sai was on her radar, but later this Narayan Sai was so lost from the radar of Surat Police that all the confidence of the Surat Police was lost and she got Narayan He went to court to pressurize Sai
 baharhaal, jo surat police ab tak lukout notice lekar narayan sai kaa pataa nahin laga paa rahi thi, vahi police ab warrant lekar kaise narayan sai tak pahonchegi, ye dekhnaa dilachasp hoga

 Prasad, who had already thrown two bouncers, then bowled the ball closer to Ishant, who took a run in point
 haalanki jab eshanth ran lete hue prasad ke kareeb se gujarey to is gendbaaj ne unhen kuch kaha
 Ishant then reached the bowler again
 prasad or eshanth iske baad jab ek-duusare ko kuch kah rahe the, to dinesh chandimal vahaan se guzarate hue bhartiya ballebaaj se takaraate hue nikle or kuch bole bhi jisase bhartiya ballebaaj ravichandran aswin bhi naaraaz ho gaye

 Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee has demanded a CBI probe into the political bloodshed in Mangal Kot in Burdwan district of West Bengal

 Mamta also said that if the Trinamool Congress is guilty then she is ready to face the punishment
 
 There is tension since the Lok Sabha elections in Mangalkot, Burdwan
 hinsa kii ghatnaon ko dekhte hue yahaan dhara 144 lagu he
 The bjp's readiness to introduce a uniform civil code before the Uttar Pradesh elections has evoked sharp reactions in Muslim society
 ol india muslim personal lau board ne is prastaav ko puri tarah nakaar diya he or aarope lagaaya he kis sirf voton kii raajnneeti garmane ke liye bijepi yah mudda oochaal rahi he
 In a special conversation with Vice President of the Voice Muslim Muslim Law Board, Salbe Sadiq 'aaj Tak' against the Uniform Civil Code, the Muslims of the country will not tolerate any interference in Sharia law
 unhone kaha ki sirf muslim hi nahin desh ke duusare alpsankhyak samudaay bhi iskaa virodh karenge kyonki ye dharmik reeti rivaaj main dakhal dene vaali baat hogi
 Attacking BJP Another member of Muslim Personal Law Board, Maulana Khalid Rashid Firangi Mahali, warned the government that if the BJP government takes any such step, Muslim Personal Law Board will not sit
 unhone kaha ki maamla sirf musalamaanon kaa nahin he desh main kashmir se lekar mizoram tak alag-alag logon ke liye alag alag kanoon khud desh kii sansad ne banaae hai
 Differences among Muslim religious leaders regarding divorce, but there are sharp differences within the Muslim Personal Law Board on the sensitive issue of triple talaq
 bharat main shiya musalamaanon ke sabase bade dharmik guru or personal lau board ke upaadhyaksh kalbe sadik teen talaak ke sakht khilaaf hai
 He says that this discriminates against women and this practice should end
 shiya musalamaanon main vaise bhi teen talaak kii pratha nahin he
 But most Sunni religious leaders argue in favor of triple talaq despite all criticism
 moulana khalid rashid firangi mahali ne kaha ki ise khatm nahin kiya ja saktaa lekin iske beja istemaal par roak lagani chahie
 Muslim religious leaders raised questions about the time
 Most of the Muslim religious leaders in Uttar Pradesh feel that neither the BJP government will bring a uniform civil code nor will they push for the abolition of triple talaq
 unka maananaa he ki sirf uttar pradesh menvoton kaa dhruvikarnakrakar hinduon kaa vot batorne ke liye bijepi in muddon ko charchaa main laana chaahati he
 Just like the last time during the Uttar Pradesh elections, the UPA government tried to garner votes by assuring them of reservation for Muslims
 lekin baad main hua kuch nahin

 buudhvaar ko supreme court kii kadi chetavanee ke baad priyanka sharma ko aaj reeha kar diya gaya
 Let us tell you that on Tuesday, the Supreme Court ordered the release of Priyanka Sharma, but the Alipur Jail Administration of Kolkata did not release

 On Wednesday, the apex court gave a stern warning to the Alipur Jail administration in Kolkata that if Priyanka Sharma was not released within half an hour, be prepared to bear the brunt

 According to the prison manual the court order requires confirmation

 To this, the Supreme Court said that our order cannot overrule the manual of the jail administration
 aapako bataa den ki priyanka sharma ne mukhyamantri mamata banerjee kii morph tasviir soshal media par saajha kii thi
 The Trinamool Congress had complained to the police about this and was then arrested

 After this, Priyanka Sharma filed a bail petition in the Supreme Court

 The BJP won this seat in 2014, but in the by-elections held in early 2018, the BJP lost the Alwar and Ajmer seats to the Congress

 sabase zyada karje main duube jalalpura gaanv jate vakt bamhor gaanv ke najadik teen bujurg kisaan bhai mili
 His urad crop had dried up
 teenon ke haathon main fata chaataa or ek bujurg ke sharir par kapade tak nahin the
 Seeing them, the eyes forgot to differentiate between dry fields and farmers
 haathon kaa jarjar chaataa utana hi kamjor dikh rahaa tha jitna urad kii sukhi pattiyaan
 The elderly holding the bandaged umbrella in their hands said, Son, we are not even able to pay wages
 is saal gaay bachhadon ko logon ne chutta chhod diya he or gaanv chhodkar log majuri karne shahar ja rahe hai
 There are widows, elders and women in the village who cannot go to the city
 bundelkhand main urad or til ke khet suukh rahe hai lekin kisaanon par bainkon kaa karja badhata ja rahaa he
 The situation is that one bank has to take loan to repay the loan
 bundelkhand ke kareeb 14 lakh kisaanon par sarkari bainkon kaa karja kareeb ek hazaar karod se zyada kaa he
 Debt is a major reason behind the death of farmers of Bundelkhand
 iskaa kaaran jaanane ham jhaansi se kareeb 80 kimi dur jalalpura gaanv kii ore chal pade
 Every farmer in this village with nearly two hundred houses is immersed in debt
 puure gaanv par sarkari bank kaa kareeb 11 karod rupye kaa bakaayaa he
 According to the rule, a farmer can take a loan from a bank only once, but with the help of middlemen, the farmers have taken a loan from many banks
 bank kaa 12 lakh bakaayaa vaale raghuvendra parihaar kehete hai ki bhayya sabarai upar karja he, kisi ke upar do lakh kisi ke upar chaar lakh
 i asked how do i get such a loan, then he told that the broker collects the NOC from the bank and get the loan from the other bank
 ek lakh ke karje par dalal kaa 25 hazaar banataa he
 Similarly, the money lender of the village mortgages the land before lending
 karja bhi 100 rupee par paanch rupee rojaanaa vasuulata he
 Farmers who used to pay their debts by growing crops, their debts have been increasing due to drought in the last six years but they are unable to repay
 isi gaanv main barabaad khet ko dekhakar april maheene main amarpal kii sadame se maut ho gai
 He has a loan of two and a half lakhs
 ab use chuktaa karne ke liye ladke gujarat main mazdooree kar rahe hai or bacchon ke saath bahu beete chah maheene se ghar main akeli rah gai he
 However, the District Magistrate of Jhansi says that the banks have been instructed not to pressurize the farmer to recover the loan
 jalalpura gaanv se jhaansi lautate vakt sakaraar main hame draupadi naam kii kisaan mili
 Till 20 days ago, the crop of which Draupadi was thinking of loaning the farmer credit card, now their cattle are grazing there
 bundelkhand ke barabaad khet ab kisaanon kii jagah maweshiyon ke pet bhar rahe hai
 It is understandable to see the slippers tied by Draupadi's rope that the feet of small farmers like Draupadi are getting ripped off in the drought-fighting farmers' battle
 hamen barabaad fasal dikhaate uski ankhen bhar ain
 Draupadi said that the bankers were giving more loans so that the previous loan is repaid
 lekin maine sochaa jab 70 hazaar main nahin chuktaa kar paa rahi hum to zyada karja kyon luun
 i got into thinking that banks are getting farmers into debt trap to keep their data good
 kamjor monsoon se khet fat rahe hai, nai bani naharen sukhi padi hai
 Jagdish Ahirwar's farm is next to the canal of Sakrar
 lekin uske khet suukh gaye pani ab tak nahin aayaa
 Now they are planning to go to the city to feed
 tippaniyan 80 percent of the farmers of Bundelkhand are in debt
 lihaaja karje se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye kisaan anndaata se shahari majdoor ban rahaa he
 The one who cannot make wages, is getting held in the bank or money lender year after year
 kisaanon kii ummiden mausam kii tarah sookhti or sookhti ja rahi hai
 These are the farmers whose governments are formed and deteriorated by doing politics on their dead bodies
 jinhen anndaata jaise chunavi jumalon or jai jawan jai kisaan jaise raajnneetik naaron se mahima mandit kiya jaataa he
 In our country, the farmer is becoming like a product that we use to make ourselves great and we are throwing the farmer like an old person
 agle ank main bataaenge ki kaise kisaanon ko madad ke naam par bundelkhand package kaa 7 hajaar karod rupee netaa or adhikariyon kii jeb main ja rahaa he
 
 
 Respectively
 
 
 unhen dekhakar sookhe khet or kisaan kaa fark karnaa ankhe bhul gayi
 The shabby umbrella of the hands looked as weak as the dry leaves of Urad
 kai paband lage chaate ko haath main thame bujurg bole, betaa ham to mazdooree bhi karne laayak nahin hai
 This year, the cow calves have been abandoned by the people and leaving the village, people are going to the city to do exorcism
 gaanv main vidhwaaen, bujurg or wo auraten bachi hai jo shahar nahin ja sakati hai
 Urd and sesame fields are drying up in Bundelkhand, but the debt of banks on farmers is increasing
 halaat ye hai ki ek bank kaa karja chukaane ke liye duusare bainkon se karja lenaa pad rahaa he
 Government banks owe more than a thousand crores to about 14 lakh farmers of Bundelkhand
 bundelkhand ke kisaanon kii maut ke peeche karj ek badi vajah he
 To find out the reason, we walked towards Jalalpura village, about 80 km from Jhansi
 kareeb dhai sau ghar vaale is gaanv kaa har kisaan karje main duba he
 The entire village owes the government bank about Rs 11 crore
 niyam ke mutabik ek bank se ek kisaan ek baar hi karja le saktaa he lekin bichauliyon kii madad se kisaanon ne kai bainkon se karja le rakhaa he
 Raghuvendra Parihar, who owes 12 lakhs of the bank, says that Bhagya Sabarai is a debt, two lakhs above anyone, four lakhs over someone
 maine poocha itnaa karja kaise mil jaataa he to unhone bataaya ki dalal bank se anaapatti pramaan patr kaa jugad karte hai or duusare bank se karja dilaa dete hai
 a broker makes 25 thousand on a loan of one lakh
 isi tarah gaanv kaa sahuukaar karja dene se pehle jameen girvee rakhata he
 The loan also charges five rupees a day for 100 rupees
 jis khet kii fasal ugaakar kisaan apana karja chukaate the beete chah saal se sookhe kii vajah se unka karja bad rahaa he lekin wo chukaa nahin paa rahe hai
 In the same village, Amarpal died of shock in April after seeing a farm destroyed
 uske upar dhai lakh kaa karja he
 Now the boys are working in Gujarat to pay it off and the daughter-in-law with the children has been left alone at home for the last six months
 haalanki jhaansi ke jiladhikari kehete hai ki bainkon ko nirdesh die gaye hai ki karja vasuulne ke liye kisaan par dabaav nahin daalaa jaae
 While returning to Jhansi from Jalalpura village, we found a farmer named Draupadi in Sakrar
 20 din pehle tak draupadi jis khet kii fasal se kisaan credit card kaa karja utaarne kii soch rahi thi vahaan ab unke maveshi char rahe hai
 The cluttered fields of Bundelkhand are now being fed by cattle instead of farmers
 draupadi kii rassi se bandhi chappal dekhakar samajha ja saktaa he ki sookhe se chal rahi kisaanon kii ladaai main draupadi jaise chote kisaanon ke pair ukhd rahe hai
 His eyes filled up showing us wasted crops
 draupadi ne bataaya ki bank vaale zyada lone de rahe the jisase pehle vaala karja chuktaa kar lo
 But i thought when i am not able to repay 70 thousand then why should i take more loan
 main soch main pad gaya ki bank apana aankada acha rakhane ke liye kisaanon ko karj ke jaal main fansaa rahe hai
 Due to the weak monsoon, the fields are bursting, the newly built canals are dry
 sakaraar kii nahar ke bagal main jagadish ahirwar kaa khet he
 But the water that dried up his fields has not come yet
 pet paalane ke liye ab wo shahar jane kaa man bana rahe hai
 The comments bundelkhand ke 80 fisadi kisaan karje main duube hai
 Hence, to get rid of debt, the farmer is becoming an urban laborer from a provider
 jo mazdooree nahin kar saktaa he wo bank yaa sahuukaar ke karje main saal dar saal jakadta ja rahaa he
 The expectations of the farmers are growing and drying up like the seasons
 ye wo kisaan hai jinaki laashon par raajnneeti karke sarkarein banati or bigadati hai
 Those who are glorified by political slogans like Annadata and electoral jumalis and Jai Jawan Jai Kisan
 hamaare desh main kisaan ek aise product kii tarah banataa ja rahaa he jiskaa istemaal ham khud ko mahaan banane ke liye karte hai or kisaan ko puraane samaan kii tarah phenkate ja rahe hai
 In the next issue, we will tell how in the name of help to the farmers, 7 thousand crore rupees of the Bundelkhand package is going into the pockets of leaders and officials

 While returning to Jhansi from Jalalpura village, we found a farmer named Draupadi in Sakrar
 20 din pehle tak draupadi jis khet kii fasal se kisaan credit card kaa karja utaarne kii soch rahi thi vahaan ab unke maveshi char rahe hai
 The cluttered fields of Bundelkhand are now being fed by cattle instead of farmers

 To find out the reason, we walked towards Jalalpura village, about 80 km from Jhansi
 kareeb dhai sau ghar vaale is gaanv kaa har kisaan karje main duba he
 The entire village owes the government bank about Rs 11 crore
 niyam ke mutabik ek bank se ek kisaan ek baar hi karja le saktaa he lekin bichauliyon kii madad se kisaanon ne kai bainkon se karja le rakhaa he
 Raghuvendra Parihar, who owes 12 lakhs of the bank, says that Bhagya Sabarai is a debt, two lakhs above anyone, four lakhs over someone

 Similarly, the money lender of the village mortgages the land before lending
 karja bhi 100 rupee par paanch rupee rojaanaa vasuulata he
 Farmers who used to pay their debts by growing crops, their debts have been increasing due to drought in the last six years but they are unable to repay

 However, the District Magistrate of Jhansi says that the banks have been instructed not to pressurize the farmer to recover the loan

 It is understandable to see the slippers tied by Draupadi's rope that the feet of small farmers like Draupadi are getting ripped off in the drought-fighting farmers' battle

 Draupadi said that the bankers were giving more loans so that the previous loan is repaid

 Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah clarified with displeasure that he was opposed to releasing terrorists in exchange for the passengers of the hijacked IC814 aircraft in 1999 and the release projected India as a 'weak nation'
 farrukh abdulla ne enditivi se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki main aapse eemaandaaree se kah rahaa hum ki maine mahasoos kiya ki laalkrishna adwani ji yatriyon ke badale aatankwaadiyon ko chhodane ke paksh main nahin the
 This is true
 abdulla ne yah bhi kaha ki unhone tatkaaleen uppradhanmantri laalkrishna adwani or tatkaaleen videsh mantri jaswant singh ko chetaya tha ki badale main kisi ko reeha nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Jaswant Singh said that the country is in a weak state, we cannot fight
 purv ro pramukh eyes daulat dwaara likhit pustak ‘kashmir: da vaajapeyi iers’ ke vimochan ke maukey par abdulla ne kaha, koi bhi raashtra balidaan ke bagaiyr nahin banataa
 Even if the terrorists had taken my daughter hostage, i would not have released a single terrorist
 tippaniyan He said, similarly, if we had shown perseverance in the abduction case, we would have seen Americans and others around us helping us
 (inputs bhashaa se bhi) Farooq Abdullah said in a special conversation with NDTV that i am sincerely telling you that i felt that LK Advani was not in favor of leaving terrorists in return for the passengers
 yahi sach he
 Abdullah also said that he warned the then Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani and the then Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh that no one should be released in return
 jaswant singh ne kaha ki desh kamjor sthiti main he, ham ladaai nahin lard sakate
 Speaking at the release of the book 'kashmir: The Vajpayee Years' written by former RAW chief AS Daulat, Abdullah said, no nation is made without sacrifice
 yahaan tak ki agar aatankwaadiyon ne meri beti ko bandhak banaaya hota to main ek bhi aatankwaadi ko reeha nahin karata
 The comments unhone kaha, isi prakaar se, agar hamane apharan maamle main dridhtaa dikhaai hoti to ham americanyon or anya ko hamaare aasapaas hamaari madad karte hue dekhte
 (also from the input language) abdulla ne yah bhi kaha ki unhone tatkaaleen uppradhanmantri laalkrishna adwani or tatkaaleen videsh mantri jaswant singh ko chetaya tha ki badale main kisi ko reeha nahin kiya janaa chahie

 (also from the input language) (inputs bhashaa se bhi) The BJP criticized West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for criticizing the Center's decision to discontinue large denomination notes, saying her opposition was an 'excuse to save crores of rupees' which Trinamool Congress leaders allegedly ponzi Drone in the plans
 bhaajapa ke rashtriya sachiv siddharth nath singh ne kaha, ‘aaj mamata banerjee ek vittiya apatkaal or garib logon kii pareshaani ke bare main baat kar rahi hai
 But where was he and his party when Ponzi scheme companies cheated 17 lakh people of the state
 trinmul congress ke kai netaaon kii unke saath nazdikiyaan thim
 ' unhone aarope lagaaya ki trinmul congress shashan ke dauraan bengal ‘jihadiyon or jaali bhartiya noton ke thagon ke liye ek surakshit panaahagaah’ ke taur par tabdeel ho gaya he
 The comments singh ne kaha, ‘trinmul congress itani pratikriya isliye vyakt kar rahi he kyonki use pataa he ki sarada ghotaale kii sabhi dhanrashi 500 rupee or 1000 rupee ke note band hone ke baad bekaar kaagaj ban gai he
 This is the only reason for opposing this noble idea of bringing black money in front
 ’ (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) BJP national secretary Siddharth Nath Singh said, 'today Mamata Banerjee is talking about a financial emergency and the problems of poor people
 lekin vah or unki party tab kahaan thi jab rajya ke 17 lakh logon se ponji yojana companiyon ne thagi kii thi
 Many Trinamool Congress leaders were close to him
 ’ He alleged that during the Trinamool Congress rule, Bengal has transformed into a 'safe haven for jihadis and thugs of fake Indian currency'
 tippaniyan Singh said, 'the Trinamool Congress is reacting so much because it knows that all the money in the Saradha scam has become worthless paper after the Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes have been closed

 Sometimes due to a little carelessness, we get pimples in the skin of our head and the biggest reason for this is sweat and dirt
 agar samay rahete in par dhyaan na diya jaae to yah baalo ko nuksaan pahanchaa sakate hai
 In such a situation, they can be easily got rid of with the help of some home remedies
 aaie jaane, aise hi kuchhagharelu nuskhon ke bare main jo aapaki sir kii twachaaka khyaal rakhane main aapaki madad karenge
 
 
 1
 neem main antiseptic or antibiotic gun hote hai jo munhaason ko jaldi sukhaane main sahaayak hote hai
 Boil some neem leaves and make a paste and apply it on the pimples
 2
 Turmeric is very effective in treating acne on the scalp
 haldi powder or nariyal ke tel ko 1:4 ke anupaat main milaayein or ise sankramit bhaag par lagaaein
 After some time, wash it with lukewarm water
 3
 Apple cedar vinegar has antiseptic and antibacterial properties that cleanse acne-causing bacteria and oil from the scalp skin
 vinegar or pani ko samaan maatra main milakar is mishran ko baalo main lagaakar 20 minute ke liye chhod den
 Wash your head for a while
 4

 yah munhaason ko bahut hi kam samay main thik kar detaa he
 5
 tii tree oil antiseptic or keetanunashak kii tarah kaary karata he tathaa munhaase paidaa karne vaale keetanuon ko martha he
 Mix the same amount of olive oil and tea tree oil well, and applying this mixture on the skin of the scalp is beneficial
 6
 Honey inhibits acne-causing bacteria

 Tomatoes contain salicylic acid which helps in removing pimples
 jab internet kii is duniya kaa namakaran ‘‘soshal media’’ nahin hua tha or fasebuk kaa namonishaan bhi nahin tha, us vakt bhi orkut jaisi soshal netwarking site par jati, nasl, raajnneeti or dharm apni dhamak jataa chuke the
 Facebook and Twitter further enhanced these colors

 If Brahmanism is making a loud noise, then the condemnation proposal of the Brahminical system is also not being passed in a weak voice

 Facebook's Indian Muslim page dedicated to Muslims gives ten reasons for Facebook star Narendra Modi not to become PM and also openly appeals to Muslims to work on the "defeat Modi" agenda
 iske saath hi vah un musalamaanon ko dhokheybaaj bataane kii muhim bhi chalaata he, jo modi ke liye muslim topi pahante hai
 This Indian Muslim page of Facebook only talks about politics and there are about two lakh people with it in Facebook's Muslim politics
 haalanki shuruyaat main soshal netwarking ke liye maidan main utre fasebuk jaise soshal media site ke liye ‘‘politics’’ koi focus aria nahin tha, lekin aaj kaarobaar or khel ke alaava ‘‘politics’’ ascharyajanak rup se soshal media kaa sabase pasandida shagal ban gaya he
 These are the areas of success that are calculated globally and record is created
 lekin aisa koun-sa jaateey samooh, nasleey samooh or dharmik samooh he, jo fasebuk par nahin he?beete saal history chounal ne jab greatest indian kii khoj shuru kii to online media ne jamkar bhagidaari kii
 As a result, the jury saw Jawaharlal Nehru as the greatest Indian after Gandhi, but the internet public has seen Dr
 after Gandhi
 ambedkar ko desh kaa sabase bada sapoot bataaya
 Nehru came last
 soshal media kii duniya main baat itane se bani nahin
 For a long time there remained a debate in the online world that Drs
 ambedkar ko gandhi ke baad sabase mahaan kyon bataaya ja rahaa he? dow
 Ambedkar is not only after Gandhi, but also a greater Indian than Gandhi
 dow
 One of the dozens of Facebook pages dedicated to Ambedkar exists with this name, which describes Ambedkar as India's first great Indian
 bahes ab bhi jari he or bahes ke band hone kaa koi kaaran najar nahin aata

 Intellectual communism may appear to be more or less absent in the midst of these claims and counter-claims, but this new coffeehouse of debate is not at all incomprehensible or monotonous
 bharat main fasebuk ne narendra modi ko sthapit kiya yaa phir narendra modi ne fasebuk ko, iskaa nirnaayak uttar khoj paanaa mushkil hi nahin, naammumkin he
 Because in India, Narendra Modi came more or less simultaneously on Facebook and Facebook
 narendra modi ke poj or pej itane prabhaavshaalee ho jaaenge ki paanch saal main sabase badi fasebuk aabaadi unhen like karne lagegi, yah shaayad tab kisi ne sochaa nahin hoga
 But as is true of the world of social media, the first winner here is the one who takes the initiative first
 narendra modi ke saath bhi yahi hua
 His initiative came much earlier, as a result of which he has more than 57,00,000 followers on Facebook today
 haalanki twitor par dalai lamas ke 80,00,000 folunron ke mukaable yah sankhya bahut kam he, lekin twitor par bhi ab narendra modi shashi tharur or manmohan singh se badi raajnneetik shakhsiyat ban chuke hai
 Perhaps this is why Facebook has started calling for "ideological fascism", but what is the craze of "namo" on Facebook, it can be seen from this that two unofficial names were created in the name of Narendra Modi
 There are also two million likes on Facebook pages
 aise main ek swaabhaavik sawaal ubharta he ki soshal media main kya ve beaawaj hai, jinaki aawaaj sabase zyada mukhar honi chahie
 It is also difficult to think in the form of self-styled representatives of ethnic and religious groups personally leading ideological debates

 There is no consensus on the assembly seats in this alliance

 If RLD is also included in the alliance, he will have to give at least 20 seats
 iske alaava kuch anya chote dalon ko bhi paanch se saat siten deni hongi
 If seats are given according to the demand of these parties, then Samajwadi Party will have to give about 25 seats out of the fixed 300 of its share
 vastav main upi main congress or sapa donon ko hi gathbandhan karne kii jarurat he
 In western Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi Party appears to be harmed by the Muzaffarnagar riots and the Akhlaq massacre

 sutron ke mutabik mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav mahagathbandhan kaa swaroop tay kar rahe hai
 They are ready to give 90 seats to the Congress, but are seeking more than a hundred seats
 yadi ralod ko bhi gathbandhan main shaamil kiya jaataa he to use kam se kam 20 siten deni hongi
 Apart from this, some other smaller parties will also have to give five to seven seats
 yadi in dalon kii maang ke mutabik siten di jaati hai to samaajawaadee party ko apane hisse kii tay teen sau main se kareeb 25 siten deni hongi
 In fact, both the Congress and the SP need to form an alliance in UP
 pashchimi uttar pradesh main mujffarnagar danga or akhlaaq hatyakand ke kaaran samaajawaadee party ko nuksaan hota dikh rahaa he
 The SP is seen losing its traditional minority vote
 duusari taraf basapa kii najar in voton par he
 In these circumstances, the SP needs to form an alliance with the Congress and secular parties like this to get this vote bank in its favor
 gauratlab he ki pichley loksabhaa chunaav main uttar pradesh main bijepi ne 73 siton par jeet hasil kii
 These results made it clear that in UP, the support base of SP and Congress has decreased
 vikaas ke mudde par akhilesh majboot hai
 up's development will benefit them, but they will need the support of other parties to overcome this difficult electoral stunt
 sahyogiyon ke liye kuch siton kii kurabaani bhi deni pad sakati he

 There is a lot to be learned from the religious scriptures of India to get success in life and career
 ji haa, bharat ke sabase mahatvapurn dharmik granth mahabharat se student kaaphi sikh le sakate hai
 Learn 6 tips to get success from Mahabharata 1
 buree sangat hameshaa nuksaan daayak:ham sab ne mahabharat padhakar yaa serial dekhakar jarur yah sochaa hoga ki shakuni ne kauravon kii jindagi nark bana di or unka sab kuch barbaad kar diya jo bhi unka ho saktaa tha
 Through Shakuni, it is learned for students that they always avoid people who are not well-behaved
 2
 Friends who live without conditions are good: Lord Krishna proved that the Pandavas were with all the difficult times, that friends are the only good people who live with you under any circumstances
 dosti main sharton ke liye koi jagah nahin he, isliye ek student ko bhi aise hi dost apane aas-paas rakhane chahie jo har mushkil paristhiti main unka saath de saktaa ho
 3
 jidangi main har vakt sikhte rahanaa:mahabharat kaa sabase bada yoddha arjuna ne naa keval apane guru se sikh liya balki vah apane anubhavon se hameshaa kuch na kuch sikhte rahe
 This learning is necessary for every student
 student ko shikshak ke alaave apni galatiyon or asafalataaon se hameshaa siikhnaa chahie
 4
 adhure gyaan matlab khatre kii ghanti:mahabharat main abhimanyu apni veerta ke liye janaa jaataa he lekin chakravyuuh bhedane ke unke adhure gyaan ne unhen maut ke munh main dhakel diya
 Students should always remember that whatever knowledge they get, they will get complete and not incomplete, it can get you in trouble many times
 5
 To be successful, it is necessary to be obsessed: we can hardly get more obsessed than Eklavya of Mahabharata
 eklavya se hamen yah siikhnaa chahie ki safalataa usee ko milegi jo jununee hoga
 Eklavya is a good example for students
 6
 Master Strategy: If the Pandavas did not have the master strategy of Lord Krishna, the Pandavas would hardly have won the war

 He said, 'I don't think there is a greater danger than Stan or Morkel

 He is young and has the pace that allows a batsman to face uneven bounce

 He said, 'he should play the role that Javagal Srinath, Zaheer Khan or Kapil Dev played in his era

 Apparently Hirani will direct the film

 It is obvious that the film can be made in two parts, either to be directed by someone else instead of Hirani, or to postpone the film for a long time

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who has been facing criticism from all around for asking for a turning pitch, remained adamant on demanding such a pitch even today
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘jab upmahadweep kii baat aati he to isamen spinner ahm bhoomika adaa karte hai
 Whatever the result, we should stand on such wickets, which is our specialty
 ’unhone dobaaraa doharaaya, ‘ham terning pichon par kaayam rahenge

 Sometimes we see that even five days is not enough to get results
 mujhe lagata he ki chunautiyaan tabhi aati hai jab aap spin ke mufeed pich par khelte ho
 It does not matter whether you lose a few matches or win the series
 ’motera main mili haar ke baad england ne vankhede stadium kii terning pich par bharat ko 10 wicket se haraakar vaapasi kii or shrinkhalaa 1-1 se baraabar kar lee
 But Dhoni said that losing and winning does not matter, but it is important to maintain the domestic conditions
 unhone kaha, ‘test cricket vibhinn paristhitiyaan dena he, jis par sabhi timen acha khelnaa chaahati hai
 Asked if the English batsmen had washed away the Indian spin attack in Mumbai, did they assess the situation, Dhoni said, "it is not so
" ham usee pich par kaayam rahenge jisamen spin milti he
 This is similar to the way Australia and England teams win matches in their home conditions but are adamant on their expertise
 yah upmahadwipi tiimon ke liye bhi aisa hi he
 Indicating the attack of the two fast bowlers, Dhoni said, "I don't think the spinners will get much help in the beginning

 Fast bowlers will be really important

 It is also a relatively new way of settling notes for the central bank
 2001 tak puraane yaa radd ho chuke karency noton ko jala diya jaataa tha
 However, later more central banks use the soiled notes to build brick enclosures

 The popular serial 'chakravarti Ashok Samrat' airing on TV channel Colors has now got the entry of well-known TV artist Rajesh Khera
 is serial main takshashila ke ghatnakram main rajesh mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaayenge
 He says that this character will be as important as Chanakya's role
 is serial main chanakya kaa role manoj joshi ne nibhaayaa
 Regarding his character in 'chakravarti Ashok Samrat', Rajesh said that the role of Mera Devvrat in this serial is like the character of Chanakya
 vah ashok ke sangrakshak honge
 It will be important for all viewers to watch this serial
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki 'mancolorsake saath dobaaraa kaam karke bahut khush hum or main khud ko kismat vaala mahasoos kar rahaa hum ki is channel ne hameshaa se mujhe majboot kirdaar kii peshkash kii he
 ' dilli ke kaaryakari mukhya sachiv kii niyukti ko lekar alji najeeb jang or mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke bichghmasanamen nayaa mode aa gaya he
 According to the latest revelations, the Kejriwal government agreed to the name of Shakuntala Gamlin and wrote a letter to the LG in this regard
 ajtak ke paas dilli ke dipti siem manish sisodiya kii vah chitthee he, jisamen unhone gamelin ke naam par sahmati darj kii he
 It is clearly written in the letter, 'we can choose any one from Shrimati Gaimalin and Shri Parimal Rai
 'upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya kii 13 may ko uparajyapal ko bheje gaye prastaav kii copy ajtak ko mili he, jisamen khud sisodiya ne gamelin kii niyukti kaa vikalp uparajyapal ko bheja he
 That is, there was no dispute from the Kejriwal government nor any complaint before the appointment in Gamlin's name, but as soon as the Lieutenant Governor cleared Gamlin's appointment, the entire Kejriwal government fell behind the Lieutenant Governor
 chitthee ke mutabik, sisodiya ne kaaryvahak mukhya sachiv ke liye afasar miss naini se baat kii lekin unhone kaarybhaar lene se manaa kar diya
 Sisodia himself vetoed the appointment of SP Singh and said that everyone knows the reason for not appointing him
 arvind raay ke bare main likhaa ki wo pehle hataae ja chuke hai
 Shakuntala Gamlin did not accuse Sisodia
 saaf likhaa ki gamelin or parimal raay main se chunaav ho saktaa he
 That is, the Deputy Chief Minister himself gave the objection in the name of Gamlin to the Lieutenant Governor
 haalanki noting ke aakhir main sisodiya ne saaf likhaa ki main parimal raay ke naam kaa prastaav karata hum
 Here, day after day, there is a paradox that the new twist in the appointed case came after the lock of one Babu's office, one was declared illegal
 somvaar ko din chadhate hi mukhyamantri or uparajyapal ke bich takaraav kaa ek alag hi manjar saamne aayaa
 The AAP administration locked the room of Principal Secretary (services) Anindo Majumdar and after that senior bureaucrat and Kejriwal's favorite Rajendra Kumar was appointed to the post
 alji ko likhi chitthee par bavaalamajumdaar hi vah adhikari hai, jinhoneshkuntla gamelinako mukhya sachiv ke taur par niyukt kiye jane ke aadesh ko shuukravaar ko adhishuchet kiya tha
 Reacting sharply to Kumar's appointment, Jung wrote a letter to Kejriwal denying his appointment in place of Majumdar as well as clearly stating that the decision to transfer and appoint senior bureaucrats was final
 they have
 
 
 
 And as the letter reached the media, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia tweeted, "surprisingly, a constitutional tribunal is leaking a letter written to the Chief Minister before reaching him
" kya bharat ke samvidhan main isaki ijaajat he
 Earlier in the day, Majumdar found a lock on his office at the Delhi Secretariat
 sarkaar main sutron ne bataaya ki karyaalay par taala lagane kaa aadesh mukhyamantri ke karyaalay se aayaa he

 com / ccqmwejpjz modi sarkaar ne kendriya bajet or iconomic survey kii kam se kam copy chhapane kaa faisla liya he
 This step has been taken under the Green Initiative
 is faisle se saaf he ki aagaamee bajet kii prindet copy media or aam aadmi ko nahin di jaaegi
 Therefore, now media will have to resort to digital copy of budget and economic survey on the website of Ministry of Finance
 vitt mantralay kii taiyaari ke mutabik is salbajet or iconomic surveki sirf 788 prati print kii jayega
 This printed copy will be given only to members of Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha
 vahiin aam aadmi or media ke liye bajet or iconomic survey kidigital copisadan ke patal par rakhe jane ke turant baad website par uplabdh ho jaaegi
 The Economic Survey will be presented in the House on 31 January and the General Budget on 1 February
 kendra sarkaar kaa yah faisla vitt varsh 2014-15 ke dauraan parliamentary standing cameti kaa in documents kaa kam se kam print karaane ke suzav ke baad liya gaya he
 According to the Central Government data, during the budget 2016, the Central Government had reduced the printing of the Budget and Economic Survey by 60% to a mere 2,047 copies of the General Budget
 vahiin bajet 2015 ke dauraan kul 5,100 prati print karai gai thi
 It is worth noting that the central government spent Rs 3,450 in printing a copy of the budget 2016
 vahiin bajet or iconomic survey kii free copy sadasyon or media ko dene ke baad atirikt copy ko sabsidi ke saath 1,500 rupee main loksabhaa ke counter se bechaa jaataa tha
 At this rate, the central government had to spend more than Rs 70 lakh in 2016 to get a copy of the budget

 police ke mutabik,yah tantric kanuwai main mahalaya amavasya ke avasar par raatri puja ke liye aayaa tha
 While these people were returning to their villages, one of these men Jeevanandam pulled the hand of a 15-year-old girl near the government school
 ladki ke shor machaane par is ghatana kii jaankaree gaanvvaalon ko mil gai
 His gathered people grabbed the tantric and beat him fiercely

 The case is being investigated by registering a case against him
 supreme court ne ayodhya ke vivaadit jameen ko lekar apana faisla suna diya he
 The court, in its judgment, declared all the disputed part in the name of Ramlala as the owner of Ramlala seated on this land
 haalanki, court ne masjid banane ke liye musalamaanon ko bhi ayodhya main kahin duusari jagah paanch acre jameen dene kaa faisla kiya he
 The court, while giving the verdict in favor of Ramlala Virajman, said that during the action that lasted more than 40 days, we looked at all the evidence and witnesses
 is dauraan donon hi paksh kii taraf se saboot pesh kiye hai
 We want to tell you that during this time, the evidence kept by the Hindu side, more than the evidence of the Muslim side, proves that the disputed land belonged to Ramlala Virajman
 court ne faisla sunaane ke dauraan kaha ki sambhaavnaaon ke santulan par, yah spasht karne ke liye spasht saboot hai ki 1857 main gril-eent kii diwaar kii sthapana ke baavjood bahari angan main hinduon dwaara puja jari rakhi gai thi
 They were occupied in the outer courtyard
 iske saath is vivaadit hisse par unke unke niyantran kii baat bhi sabit hoti he
 In addition, entry into the three domed structure was possible only from either of the two gates on the eastern and northern sides of the outer courtyard
 or hamen jo saboot mili hai usase yah sabit hota he ki in dwaar par hinduon kaa niyantran tha
 After the Supreme Court's decision on the Ayodhya case, PM Modi addressed the country and shortly after that Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also spoke before the people of the state
 siem yogi adityanath ne kaha ki ham sabane pehle bhi apil kii thi ki supreme court kaa jo bhi faisla ho, use sweekaar karnaa hoga
 We are very happy that all the people have welcomed the Supreme Court's decision with an open heart
 unhone media ko dhanyavad dete hue kaha ki puure media ne jis tarah se is maamle ko prastut kiya or nakaaratmakataa ko nakaarte hue jis prakaar se aage badhaayaa vah abhinandaneey he
 He said that this decision is conveying a lot of message, the decision taken by a family or any class, community or religion to take forward the resolve of one India and the best of India and the way it was accepted is praiseworthy
 yogi adityanath ne kaha ki paanchon nyaayamurti ne jis prakaar se ekamat hokar yah faisla diya he or jis prakaar ise sweekaara he
 He shows why India is considered the best in the world
 duniya ke sabase bade or puraane maamle ke patakshep hone par sabakaa dhanyavad detaa hum
 He said that when i went to Ayodhya after becoming the Chief Minister, i could clearly see how it has been ignored, as if Ayodhya was in exile
 ab ayodhya desh or duniya main nai chamak or abha ke saath najar aayega
 The Supreme Court has given possession of the disputed land in Ayodhya to the Government Trust to build the temple, and in a 'prominent' place in this holy city of Uttar Pradesh, giving a historic verdict in the case of decades old and has been agitating the whole country
 Land will also be allocated for the mosque

 The justices said that it was necessary to do so, as it is the responsibility of the court to 'ensure that the mistakes made are also rectified'
 court ne yah bhi kaha ki 'sahishnutaa tathaa paraspar sah-astitv hamaare desh tathaa uski janata kii dharmanirpeksh patibaddhta ko pusht karte hai
 
 
 The court said that a trust or board should be formed by the government within three months for the construction of the temple

 The song has been given a voice by Micah Singh, it is also liked by the people, but Salman was first to give his voice to this song
 salmaan ne kaha,'mika ne meraa gaanaa churaayaor is vajah se yah gaanaa hit ho gaya
 i tried hard to give my voice to this, but Micah managed to get this song from me
 'haalanki, yah pehali baar nahin jab mika ne koi gaanaa gaaya ho, jise pehle salmaan se gavaaya janaa tha
 Salman went on to sing 'jumme Ki Raat' in the movie 'kick', but the film used the song which was sung by Micah, which became a big hit
 idhar, mika ne kaha, 'salmaan bhai ne'jumme kii raat'bahut umdaa gaaya tha or maine usne kaha ki unki aawaaj kaa gaanaa relies kiya jaae
 i was in Jakarta when i got 12 at night
 30 baje unka phone aayaa, maine unase kaha ki mujhe unka gaanaa pasand he, lekin unhone kaha ki main ise dobaaraa sun lu or apni aawaaj main gaanaa bhejun

 main hairaan rah gaya or kaha ki ruko 'jumme kii raat' bhi aa rahi he

 mahesh bhupati ne mangalvaar ko ek baar phir saaf kar diya ki vah liender pes ke saath landan olympic ke liye purush yugal jodi nahin banaaenge
 Bhupathi's statement came after Union Sports Minister (independent Charge) Ajay Maken's statement in which he overcame Indian tennis controversy saying that All India Tennis Association (AITA) should choose the team for the London Olympics
 somvaar ko jari apane us bayaan ko lekar, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki eitie ko do yugal timen landan bhejni chahie, sthiti saaf karte hue maakan ne kaha ki unhone yah baat isliye kahi thi kyonki yah mudda desh ko maan-sammaan dilaane vaale khilaadiyon ne uthaaya he
 This was followed by Bhupathi's statement, in which he said that he would not play with Paes
 bhupati ne saaf kiya ki vah sirf or sirf apane saathi jodidar rohan bopanna ke saath khilne ko taiyaar hai
 Earlier, Maken said on Monday that he did not understand why when AITA can send two teams, then it is insistent on sending a team
 maakan ne haalanki mangalvaar ko swat: hi apni is chintaa ko dur karte hue team chunane kaa kaam eitie ko hi karne dene kii baat kahi
 According to Maken, it is not appropriate for politicians and the ministry to interfere in the selection process of a sports association and that is why he is saying that the selection of the team should be done by AITA
 maakan kaa yah bayaan eitie dwaara bhupati or liender pes kii jodi banane ke apane faisle kaa bachaav kiye jane ke baad aayaa tha
 Shortly before Maken's statement, AITA suggested five ways to end the selection problem before the government, putting the ball in the court

 The comments ojha ne kaha ki aisa kiya ja saktaa he lekin yah bhi sochna jaruri he ki pes jaise senior khilaadi kii pratishtha se is chayan se kitna dhakka lagegaa
 Paes is one of the most experienced players in the world
 ojha ne kaha ki ek yaa do team chunane kaa faisla itnaa aasaan nahin he
 At the same time, Ojha criticized Bhupathi and Rohan Bopanna and said that the two players are working to humiliate the country by partnering with each other

 At the same time, Ojha criticized Bhupathi and Rohan Bopanna and said that the two players are working to humiliate the country by partnering with each other
 iske baad bhupati kaa bayaan aayaa, jisamen unhone kaha ki vah pes ke saath nahin khelenge
 Bhupathi made it clear that he is ready to play only with fellow partner Rohan Bopanna
 isse pehle, maakan ne somvaar ko kaha tha ki unhen yah samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki jab eitie do timen bhej saktaa he to phir vah ek team bhejne ko lekar jid par kyon ada hua he
 However, on Tuesday, Maken said that AITA should be allowed to do the job of choosing the team automatically, eliminating its concern
 maakan ke mutabik rajanetaaon or mantralay ke liye kisi khel sangh kii chayan prakriya main dakhal dena uchit nahin he or yahi kaaran he ki vah yah kah rahe hai ki team ke chayan kaa kaam eitie hi kare
 Maken's statement came after AITA defended its decision to pair Bhupathi and Leander Paes
 eitie ne maakan kaa bayaan aane se kuch samay pehle hi sarkaar ke paale main gend daalate hue uske saamne chayan sambandhi samasya ke ant ke liye paanch raste sujhaaye the
 AITA Secretary General Bharat Ojha, in response to Sports Minister Ajay Maken's question, said that pairing junior players like Yuki Bhambri or Vishnu Vardhan with Paes would be the most appropriate route
 tippaniyan Ojha said that it can be done but it is also necessary to think about how much this selection would be hurt by the reputation of a senior player like Pace
 pes aakhir vishwa ke sabase anbhavi khilaadiyon main se ek hai
 Ojha said that the decision to choose one or two teams is not so easy
 saath hi saath ojha ne bhupati or rohan bopanna kii aalochana kii or kaha ki do khilaadi aapas main saajhedaari karke desh ko apamaanit karne kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 Earlier, Maken said on Monday that he did not understand why when AITA can send two teams, then it is insistent on sending a team

 The election results of 270 seats have been won in the three (north, South, East) mcds in Delhi

 Other candidates have won 10 seats
 vahiin aap party kii emsidi chunaav main jabarajast haar hui he
 a few days ago, the AAP party was claiming to win more than 200 seats in the MCD elections, but the election results have turned upside down
 emsidi chunaav ke nattejey aane ke baad dilli kemukhyamantri arvind kejarivalane bijepi ko twit kar badhai di
 And Kejriwal said that his government will work with the MCD for the betterment of Delhi
 i congratulate BJP on their victory in all 3 mcds
 My govt looks forward to working wid mcds for the betterment of Delhi — Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal) April 26, 2017 Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that BJP had mastered research on evms for 5 years after losing the 2009 elections and Today the election is won on the basis of the same research and mastery
 sisodiya ne kaha, iviem tempring desh ke loktantr kii aisi kadavi sachai he, jiskaa shuru main mazaaq ud saktaa he, lekin mazaaq ke dar se ham sach bolnaa nahin chhod sakate hai
 Manoj Tiwari attacked Kejriwal, Delhi BJP state president Manoj Tiwarien targeted Kejriwal, said, "the person sitting on the post of Chief Minister is threatening people

 Tiwari said, the party which gets 67 seats in 70 of Delhi Legislative Assembly did not get 67 wards
 iske saath hi unhone dilliwaalon ke liye arvind kejariwal se milakar kaam karne kii apil kii he
 Significantly, Manoj Tiwari said- 'we also said that the work of MCD is not standard
 par iske jimmedaar kejariwal hai
 They are doing politics, they are shining their politics
 kejariwal ke liye yah ek refrendom he
 Kejriwal has always talked about Right to Recall, accept Delhi's Right to Recall and start preparing to write resignation
 'vahishravind kejariwal ke raajnneetik guru annane kaha, 'mere bataae hue maarg par nahin chale isliye is chunaav main logon ne arvind kejariwal kii 'aap' party ke paksh main vot nahin kiya or unki aaj karaari haar ho gai

 sansad ke bajet satr ke pehle maujuuda sarkaar ke tevar badal se gaye hai
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister to visit Sonia Gandhi's house and urge the government to cooperate
 pradhanmantri ne bhi kaha ki sansad loktantr kaa mandir he yahaan sabhi chizon par charchaa honi chahie, miljul kar hi loktantr ko majboot kiya ja saktaa he
 For the first time, the Prime Minister showed that he needed opposition in the Rajya Sabha
 pichley satr main to apane mantriyon ke vivaadit bayaan par rajyasabha main pradhanmantri bolne tak nahin aae, vipaksh hallaa karata rahaa or sadan nahin chal paaya
 However, the government has decided that all the ordinances the government has brought will be brought in the Lok Sabha in the form of the first bill
 yahaan se paarit karaane ke baad hi use rajyasabha main bheja jayega
 The Prime Minister's visit to Saifai at the Tilakotsav of Mulayam Singh's brother's grandson and a photo of Lalu Mulayam's family is also being seen as a strategy to intimidate the opposition in the budget session of Parliament
 sarkaar kii dikkat ye he ki ye bajet satr he or yahaan aakadon ke akad se kaam nahin chalegaa
 If the Opposition stalls a financial bill in the Rajya Sabha, the government will be deterred
 jameen adhigrahan ek aisa bill he jise udyogpati sarmathak bill mana ja rahaa he
 The government is completely stuck on this
 duusare sarkaar insuransh bill ko bhi vaapis le rahi he kyonki us par bhi aam raay nahin ban paa rahi he
 This is why the attitude of the government is changed
 vah ab apana mulaayam rup pesh kar rahi he, mil jul kar chalane kii baat kar rahi he
 But how will this happen? When you go to the Congress President's house and ask for support and a few days before you give notice to the Congress to vacate the party office, it seems a bit strange
 yahi vajah he ki abhi tak bhartiya loktantr main najaron kaa lihaaj kiya jaataa tha
 Political parties avoided directly attacking the families of the leaders
 ye sab atal bihari vaajapeyi ke samay tak to dikhaa magar uske baad khatm hota gaya
 But statistics in democracy teach a lot and lack of majority in Rajya Sabha will force BJP to learn a lot by May 2016
 aage-aage dekhie hota he kya kyonki badale badale se lag rahe hai sarkaar

 com / ezhjaaeynu This is Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) 100th win in IPL history
 vahiin, mumbai (MI) ke khilaaf kolkata kii yah chaar saal baad pehali jeet he
 Two-time champions Kolkata, batting first, scored 232 for two and then restricted Mumbai to 198 for seven in their allotted 20 overs
 kolkata kii 12 maichon main yah paanchavin jeet he
 The team now has 10 points and has reached number five in the table
 team ke paas abhi bhi plaof main pahunchane kii ummiden kaayam hai
 This is the first win for Kolkata after losing six consecutive matches this season
 desh kaa aam bajet aane main ab zyada vakt nahin rah gaya he
 And everyone's eyes are on what Pranab da will do in this budget? Will the common man get relief from inflation? Will the government be able to take some drastic measures by breaking coalition religion? And the biggest question, will Dada relax this time in income tax
 mahangaai kii chakki main pisati jindagi ke saamne sau mushkilen hai
 It is even more difficult to keep pace with income and expenses
 upar se tex kii maar
 Once again, hopeful eyes are rising towards Pranab Dada
 sabko ummid he ki dada is baar tex main chhot jarur badhayenge
 Parliamentary Committee on Direct Tax Code has also recommended to increase the basic limit of tax exemption to Rs 3 lakh
 - abhi tak ye chhot 1 lakh 80 hazaar rupaye he
 And for women, one lakh 90 thousand rupees
 -80 si ke tahat milane vaali chhot ko bhi sansadeey samiti ne do lakh 50 hazaar karne kii vakaalat kii he
 Currently, this rebate is Rs 1 lakh
 ab dada ke bajet pitare se kya nikalegaa, ye to unka brifces khulne ke baad pataa chalegaa, lekin lekin dada se ye to ummid kii hi ja sakati he ki is baar tex sleb main badlaav karte vakt dada mahangaai ko bhi dhyaan main rakhenge
 2014 is not far, when the UPA government may once again find a dent in the common man
 ek taraf log tex main chhot kii ummid lagaae baithe hai to duusari taraf sarkaar bhi mushkil main he
 The income of the government is getting scarce and expensive
 -sarkaar kaa vittiya ghaataa kaabo se baahar ho rahaa he
 - GDP growth rate is continuously falling
 -mahangaai kuch kam hone ke baad ek baar phir se raftaar pakad rahi he
 The government had to withdraw its decision to bring FDI in the retail sector
 -jiesti ko lekar abhi tak centre sarkaar rajya sarkaron ko manaane main kaamyaab nahin hui he
 In the last budget, a target of raising 40 thousand crores from disinvestment was set
 lekin sarkaar badi mushkil se sirf 14 hazaar karod rupaye hi juta pai
 Due to the coalition of several parties at the center, the government is neither able to take decisions on corruption nor about reforms
 ye dekhnaa kaaphi dilachasp hoga ki sarkaar apana do lakh karod rupaye se bhi zyaada kaa sabsidi bill kaise kam kar paati he
 Recently, after the results of elections in five states, Congress is in the backfoot and Pranab Dada is the biggest forerunner of Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi, he got into a lot of trouble soon after the increase in rail fare
 aise main ye dekhnaa kaaphi dilachasp hoga ki pranab da ke bajet main arthniti par raajnneeti baari padati he yaa nahin

 Worshiping mother Lakshmi will make life magnificent, know what is the reason behind it

 isi ke saath apane vachan ko bhi vishnu ji ne yaad dilaayaa jise maa lakshmi bhul gayi thi
 The mother realized her mistake and apologized for her mistake
 bhagwaan vishnu ne kaha ki tumne galati he or tumhen sajaa avashya milegi
 Now, live as a servant in the house from which you have brought these flowers without asking
 devi lakshmi ke is stav kaa jaap karne se ghar main hogi dhan kii varshabhagwan vishnu ke aadesh ke anusaar maa lakshmi us mali ke ghar chali gai
 Mother Lakshmi took the form of a poor woman at that time
 maa lakshmi ne mali ke ghar rahakar apni sajaa puri kari or jab us mali ko is bare main pataa chalaa to ki vah garib aurat koi or nahin maa lakshmi hai to usne maa se kshamaa maangi or kaha ki hamane aapse anjaane main hi ghar or khet main kaam karavaaya, he maa yah kaisaa aparaadh ho gaya, he maa ham sab ko maaf kar den
 Hearing this, Mother Lakshmi smiled and said, 'O Madhav you are a very nice and kind person, you have kept me like your daughter, made a member of your family
 iske badale main tumhen vardaan detii hum ki tumhaare paas kabhi bhi khushiyon kii or dhan kii kami nahin rahegi, tumhen saare sukh milenge jiske tum hakdaar ho

 On Tuesday, on the occasion of World Teachers Day, Anand was present as a speaker at an event organized by Stanford India Association of Stanford University
 unhone kaha ki aaj chaatr kushal shikshak to chaahate hai, lekin khud shikshak bananaa nahin chaahate
 it's not possible

 He said, 'india is making progress in every field today and it realizes its ability to lead the world

 reliance jeeyo yugers ko sarvice main dikkat ho sakati he
 According to et's report, if Jio fails to buy spectrum from Reliance Communications in main markets of Jio like Delhi, Maharashtra and West Bengal, then users will have problems
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki aisi sthiti main reliance communication diwalia bhi ho sakati he

 ye spectrum andhra pradesh, karnataka, tamilnadu or kerala main 4G LTE sarvice ke liye basic he
 In each of these circles, Reliance Jio has 3 of 4G airwaves under 800mhz band
 8 units he, lekin company behatar 4G LTE connactivity ke liye rcom par dependent he
 Overall, what is said in the report means that if the deal between Reliance Jio and Reliance Communication is not done on spectrum, then both companies will be at a loss
 jeeyo ke customers ko mushkil hogi, kyonki is deal se 4G LTE kawarej or conequity behatar rahegi, varna overol quality main fark padegaa
 These include Mumbai, Gujarat, Assam and North East
 exparts kaa maananaa he ki is deal main rukawat bhi aa sakati he
 Because rcom will not be able to share spectrum with Jio if Anil Ambani's company Reliance Communications goes into bankruptcy proceedings
 is report ke mutabik exparts sarkari regaullation ke hawaale se kehete hai ki do companiyon ke bich tab hi spectrum share kiye jate hai jab donon ek band par network chalaa rahe hai
 rcom has already discontinued its wireless service
