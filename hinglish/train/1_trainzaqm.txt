ahmedabad ke jamalpur khadia kshetra ke bhaajapa vidhayak bhushan bhatta aajkal apane kshetra main kachare ke bhagava rang ke dibbe baant rahe hai
 Generally these cans are blue or green
 bhushan bhatta kehete hai ki ve swatchta ke liye sab kuch kar rahe hai
 They find saffron more attractive
 ve kehete hai ki log aapke kaam ko dekhte hai or mujhe lagata he ki bhagava rang ankhon ko acha lagata he
 The comments bhatta ne apane vidhayak fund se teen lakh rupee kharch karke ab tak 1000 dustbin baante hai
 They are saying that this is happening only for the cleanliness mission
 lekin virdohi paksh congress ise raajnneeti se prerit maanata he, kyonki yah chunavi saal he
 The Congress alleges that this is being done entirely under the agenda of saffronisation of institutions

 BJP has been winning elections from this seat since 1975

 pichley loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bas stop bhagava rang main range gaye the, phir bacchon ko skool kits or ab dustbin bhi bhagava rang main rangane se vivaad bad rahaa he
 Bhatt has so far distributed 1000 dustbins from his MLA fund by spending Rs 3 lakh
 ve kah rahe hai ki yah sirf swatchta mishan ke liye ho rahaa he
 But the opposition Congress considers it politically motivated, because it is the election year
 congress kaa aarope he ki yah puri tarah sansthaanon ke bhagavakaran ke agenda ke tahat ho rahaa he
 Painting the garbage cans in saffron color is showing the petty mentality of the BJP
 bhaajapa 1975 se is seat se chunaav jitati rahi he
 This seat has been formed from Jamalpur Khadia, combining the earlier two assembly seats Khadia and Jamalpur
 khadia hameshaa se bhaajapa kaa or jamalpur hameshaa se congress kaa garh rahaa he

 Try a million is not different
 aisa nahin he ki najariya bilkul nahin badla
 But it takes time to break this perception of years Keerthi and his brother Krish from Gorakhpur became a wonder to their neighborhood and acquaintances when Kirti aspired to become a 'lady Bouncer' and Krrish aspired to become a 'chef'
 socho gorakhpur jaise shahar kii yah kitni hot news ban gai hogi jab ek ladki mardhaad kii baat kare or ek ladkaa khaanaa pakaane kii
 People ridiculed Sharma ji, taunted him and started asking brother Sharma ji, see if your son and daughter have 'gender'
 matlab betaa-beti to nahin or beti-betaa to nahin!sharmine (sharma ji kii patni) kaa ro-rokar bura haal
 Started saying, anyway, these 'satrangi' people have spoiled the air of the country
 kahin sachmuch aisa hua to? sharma ji ko kaato to khun nahin
 Kirti discovers a trick to end this parental confusion
 sharma ji koi kam padhe likhe vyakti nahin the
 He was a professor of Psychology at the University and a teacher of Mathematics in the Mother Junior Secondary
 kirti ne kaha, maa aap hindi yaa angreji yaa manovigyaan bhi to padhaa sakati thim? maa ne jhat se jawaab diya, nahin main to bachapan se ganit main bahut tej thi
 But the gender of mathematics is male It is believed that maths boys understand more
 maa ne fat se kaha, haa mere parivaar main to rivaaj tha
 Girls read art and if a girl asked to study science, then read biology, i was a girl girl studying mathematics
 sharmine ne em
 s
 si kiya tha ganit main
 And the boys could not leave mathematics even if they wanted to
 phir kirti ne pita se kaha, kya papa ‘psychology’ bhi kya koi purush padhata he
 It would have been great if you were a professor of mathematics
 hamaare dost kehete hai, psychology kaa gender to mahila kaa hota he ! pita ne jawaab nahin diya lekin use samaj main aa gaya ki kirti use kis uljhan se nikaalane ki liye yah sawaal puch rahi thi
 Well, it was good that in Kirti's house, there were instances of breaking the assumptions
 lekin agar aisa na hota to?haalanki aise anusandhan or shodhon kii bharmaar he jo is tipical dharna ko chur-chur karti hai
 In 2018, Hutchinson, Lions and Ansari concluded by knowing the interest and ability of students from first grade to sixth grade, according to the topics, that subject and gender have little relation
 lekin bade hote-hote vishay or gender kaa sambandh gaharaa hota jaataa he
 Counts? As children get older, they start choosing everything according to social thinking more than their interest
 kapade, padhai ke vishay, kariyar vagairaah, vagairaah
 
 
 In 2014, a researcher named Halpern researched it
 bhala kaise bade hote-hote bachche gender ke liye baniin dharanaon ko pusht karne lagate hai
 So they found that the children of parents are more close
 maa-baap kii sweekruti unke liye sabase zyada myne rakhti he
 Parents make the same demands from their children which fit perfectly into the notions of society
 or bachche is khaanche main feet baithne ke chakkar main gender kii zanjeeron se kaid hote chale jate hai
 Some children break it and move forward, but most are imprisoned in the perceptions of these genders
 american lekhika judi butler ne gender par acha khaasaa kaam kiya he
 Says Judy, "gender is not a fact, but many kinds of behavior create an idea of gender and then it creates the assumptions in which we humans start filling up
 judi butler kii 'gender trubalah feminism and da sabavarjan of aaidentity' (gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity) or gender ko lekar kaam karne vaali ek or mashhoor psychologist and lekhika british philosafar cordoliya fine kii 'testostiron rexh anameking da myth of jendard mind' (works Testosterone Rex) kitaab aise hi kai aankh kholane vaale tathyon ko ujagar karti he
 Breaks down the assumptions that, she says, also have gender capabilities
 *** There are many occasions when women feel that it would have been better if they had been men rather than women
 auraton ko kai aisi chizon or paristhitiyon se guzarana padataa he jinase mardon kaa kabhi saamana tak nahin hota he
 Many times, such a situation is created that women are unable to tell their problems or problems to others even if they want to and they have to bear everything alone
 haalanki kuch purush aise hote hai jo mahilaon or unki takalifon ko kaaphi had tak samajhate hai par aise mardon kii sankhya bhi kam nahin he join sabhi baton se bilkul anjaan hote hai
 These are some of the similar things and problems that a girl has to go through
 1
 Duration of periods Women have to undergo this problem every month
 periods ke dard or chidchidepan ko sahan karne ke saath hi unhen ye bhi dar rahata he kikahin kapade par daag na lag jaae
 Keeping the sanitary napkin hidden in the bag and in such a situation becomes very uncomfortable if a man accidentally opens the bag
 ladakiyon kii ye samasya ladakon ko kabhi samaj nahin aati
 2
 breast feed karanakisi bhi mahila ke liye maa bananaa duniya kaa sabase khubasurat ehsaas he lekin bachche ko sanbhaalanaa kaaphi chunauti bharaa kaam he
 Many times it happens that the child gets hungry in public place and the mother has to feed her breast
 aisi sthiti bhi mahilaon ko kuch asahaj kar detii he par mahilaon kii is samasya kaa ehsaas kam hi purushon ko hota he
 3
 kapadekai mahilaayein aisi hoti he jinhen paramparaagat paridhaan pahananaa asahaj lagata he or isi ke vipareet kai aisi bhi hoti hai jinhen western dress pahanane main takalif hoti he
 But there are times when they have to wear clothes according to others for their happiness
 4
 Handling home and office together It is not easy for anyone to handle home and office together
 par zyaadaatar mahilaon ko ye sabakuch akele hi sanbhaalanaa padataa he
 They have to manage everything from children's homework to their office projects
 ye ek bahut mushkil task he jiskaa ehsaas kam hi mardon ko hota he
 5
 apane liye vaktahar insaan ko apane liye kuch vakt chahie hota he
 But a woman playing the responsibilities of home and office does not have enough time to think about anything for herself
 kai baar ye sthiti tanaav kaa kaaran ban jaati he, jisase chidchidapan hone lagata he
 Few men consider this problem of women

 ' tanushri datta ne jis intervyuu mennana patekarpar gambhir aarope lagaae hai, usamen unhone kai or bhi aisi ahm baaten saamne rakhin, jo bollywood kaa kaala sach dikhaati hai
 Tanushree told how the actors talk to the director-producer and get the intimate scene in the film and how the A-lister actors choose their heroines themselves
 unhone juum tivi ko die intervyuu main yah bhi kaha ki glamras role karne vaali ladakiyon ko lekar kis tarah dharna banaai jaati hai ki ve waisi hi hongi
 Know what else Tanushree said in the interview, apart from accusing Nana Patekar
 # 1
 Method of keeping intimate scene "the scene is required or not, but the intimate scene is kept
 ye apni tharak nikaalane kaa said tarika hota he
 If someone wants to molest the film shooting under the guise of work, then the simple director-producer has to go and tell me to put my intimate scene with it whether it is needed or not
 ye main samaj gai thi
 "'2 people tried to enter the house, Nana's people are doing infamy' # 2
" glamras role karne vaali ladkiyaan aisi hi hongi"aapako jab takalif hoti he to aapaki baton kaa koi vishwaas nahin karata
 But such a lousy and bastard person who has done ill-treatment with people all his life
 
 
 
 People know about Nana Patekar that he has always done profanity with women
 
 
 
 But no one has ever printed
 puure maamle par sabane peeth peeche gocip kiya he
 People of such character think of a person like my character, well now this girl plays glamorous
 ab ye to glamras photo shoot karti he
 So it will be like this
 "'tanushri aise aarope laga rahi hai jaise vivek ne strip hone ko kaha' # 3
 a lister stars choose his own heroine "these who are your honorable actors, you will hear about the antics behind them or you will get shocked
 or aapke mind main jo itani badi respect bani he naa, wo nahin rahegi
 Cannot name those with whom i do not have my own experience
 ye kahi suni baaten hai
 
 
 That's why top people did not work with me that she is not such a girl
 
 
 by da ve aapako pataa hi hoga ki heroin kii role kii casting hoti he, actors karte hai
 Casting directors do not
 casting diarector baaki ke rolls kii casting karte hai
 The actress who is the top lead always casts the actor
 casting vahi (e level actors) karte hai apane comfort ke hisaab se

 Which was its previous film? isko koi aword mili the
 He asked what she gives

 — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi)april 8, 2015 The son of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi warned on Monday that the country would face a bloody civil war if anti-government protesters did not accept the proposal for reform
 samachar agency ekeai ke anusaar gaddaphi ke shashan ke khilaaf bad rahe virodh ke bich saf al-islam gaddaphi ne televijan par ek sambodhan main kaha ki unke pita sena ke samarthan se satta main bane hue hai or "antim purush, antim mahila or antim goli ke rahane tak ladenge
 "on Monday, the flame of the protest reached the capital Tripoli via regional towns and cities and at the time Saif Gaddafi's long speech was being broadcast, the sound of gunfire was echoing

 Thousands of Libyan civilians, who are excited by the successful revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt, are demanding Gaddafi to step down
 gaddaphi pichley 41 varsh se satta par kabiz hai
 Anti-government protests are also taking place in Bahrain, Yemen, Algeria and Jordan
 echardblyoo ne anya deshon kii sarkaron se aagrah kiya he ki unhen libya se kahana chahie ki vah pradarshnakariyon kii avaidh hatyaein band kare
 Saif al-islam Gaddafi said that the death toll was less than 233 and at the same time he condemned the rebellion against his father's 41 years of rule and called it a foreign conspiracy
 lekin unhone sweekaar kiya ki pradarshnakariyon ke khilaaf hinsak karrwai bhul thi or unhone ek nae libya ke nirmaan kaa nagarikon se aagrah kiya
 Arabic TV channel al-arabiya quoted son Gaddafi as saying, "libya stands at a crossroads
 yadi ham aaj sudhaaron par raji nahin hote, to hamen keval 84 logon par hi shok nahin pakat karnaa hoga, balki hajaaron logon kii mauton par aansu bahaanaa hoga, or libya main khun kii nadiyaan bahengi

 This resulted in a confrontation there and at least four foreign nationals were injured

 Also one or two Bangladeshi workers have been injured
 khabar he ki libya main somvaar ko bhi sarkaar virdohi pradarshan jari hai or sarkari imaarton ko aag ke hawaale kar diya gaya he
 Earlier reports had said that Gaddafi had left Libya, due to which the crowd was celebrating on the streets of Tripoli
 lekin bete gaddaphi ne tivi par kaha ki unke pita libya main hi hai or jang kaa netritv kar rahe hai
 Saif al-islam said, "libya is not like Tunisia and Egypt
 " unhone chetavanee di ki virodh pradarshan desh ko baant saktaa he or sankat kii sthiti paidaa kar saktaa he
 For many days before this, pro-gaddafi rallies were dominated in Tripoli

 Vivek Doval, son of National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, recorded his statement in the Patiala House court on Wednesday and gave papers related to his company and the case to the court
 dobhaal ne court main daawa kiya ki unki company main kabhi bhi 8300 karod kaa nivesh nahin hua he
 Therefore, the allegations against him are baseless
 vivek dobhaal ne congress ke varisht netaa jairam ramesh or anya ke khilaaf aapraadhik manahani kaa mukadmaa kiya he
 Jairam Ramesh and others have accused Vivek Doval that he has whitewashed black money through his company at the time of demonetisation
 desh ke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal ke bete vivek dobhaal ne court main apana bayaan darj karaate hue kaha ki jis tarah beete dinon ek magazine main unke or unke parivaar ke khilaaf likhaa gaya or congress ke varisht netaa jairam ramesh ne press conference kii usseunaki manahani hui he
 However, apart from Vivek Doval on Tuesday, his business partner Amit Sharma and a partner Nikhil Kapoor had to give their testimony in court but they could not reach
 iske baad court ne agali taarikh de di
 Now on February 11, the next hearing in the case will be held in the court
 11 farvari ko hi amit sharma or nikhil kapur kaa bayaan court main darj hoga
 It took more than 4 hours for Vivek Doval's statement to be recorded
 vivek dobhaal ne apana bayaan court main darj karaate hue kaha ki 'is artical se unke pita ajit dobhaal ko sidhe target kiya gaya
 The article was titled d-company and the photo featured father Ajit Doval and both of us brothers on either side
 puure desh ko maaloom he ki di-company daud ibrahim ko kehete hai or mere pita daud ibrahim ke khilaaf lard rahe hai
 So the article has directly damaged the image of his father and family
 'vivek dobhaal ne apane bayaan main kaha, 'pita ko wo hero maanate hai
 When he returned from Doha on 17 January 2019, his father questioned showing the article
 tab mujhe bahut dhakka laga
 First of all, my brother told me about this article on 16 January
 'vivek dobhaal ne court se kaha ki '17 janvari 2019 ko unhen maaloom chalaa ki varisht congress netaa jairam ramesh ne ek press conference kar unke pita or unhen target kiya he
 This press conference was done from the platform of the Indian National Congress

 Vivek Doval also gave the court a photocopy of Twitter and youtube, which were questioned
 vivek dobhaal ne court ko yah bhi bataaya ki un par is tarah aarope lagaae gaye hai ki isse unka kariyar hi khatm ho jayega
 He is associated with the finance sector as well as a UK citizen and takes pride in being an overseas citizen of India
 vivek dobhaal ne court main daawa kiya ki unke pita ne unke vyapaar main kabhi koi bhi madad nahin kii
 Vivek Doval said that everything about him is available on Google
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki bhartiya paise ko apni company main diarect nahin le sakate kyonki fahrren portpholio investment kaa niyantran rahata he
 His company has a total of 6 investors
 gauratlab he ki vivek dobhaal ne aapraadhik manahani kaa mukadmaa ek magazine, uske lekhak or congress netaa jairam ramesh par kiya he
 The magazine accused Vivek Doval that a few days after demonetisation, Rs 8300 crore was invested in the company of black man Vivek Doval
 us blikemani ko desh main laakar safed kiya gaya
 Further, there will be 2 more testimony in favor of Vivek Doval in this case

 ) Protests against the government by burning paddy straw in Bathinda, Punjab farmers, NGT and Punjab Haryana High Court are facing pressure on Punjab farmers not to burn straw in fields
 aise main punjab ke kisaan is baat ke liye naaraaz hai ki rajya sarkaar na to paraali kii samasya se nipatane main unki madad kar rahi he, na hi kisi tarah kaa muaavja de rahi he, jabaki neshnal green tribunel (NGT) ne iske liye nirdesh bhi diya he
 Manjit Singh, president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union's Sangrur district, says, "the state government has failed to provide us Rs 200 per quintal
 ab hamane kisaanon se kaha he ki ve dhan kii paraali ko bina kisi hichkichaahat ke jalaaen
 Till the government gives us compensation, we will continue to burn and destroy the paddy straw
 'bhartiya kisaan union ke kaaryakartaaon ne bathinda main dhan kiprali jalakarsarkaar ke khilaaf pradarshan bhi kiya he kyonki sarkaar kisaanon ko paraali jalaane se rokane ke liye muaavja dene ne asafal rahi he
 The problem of stubble blasting machine is on the target of Punjab Government, National Green Tribunal and Punjab Haryana High Court regarding this issue
 ab sarkaar ek taraf to kah rahi he ki paraali ko vaigyanik dhang se nasht karne ke liye ham kisaanon ko 50 pratishat kii sabsidi par mashine muhaiyaa kara rahe hai, lekin duusari taraf yah centre sarkaar se prati quintal upaj par 100 rupee muaavja dene kii maang kar rahi he
 Recently Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh claimed that the government had provided 28000 such machines to farmers last year
 kya ye mashine paraali kaa niptaan karne ke liye mufeed hai? yaa phir jin kisaanon ne paraali se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye in mashiinon kaa istemaal kiya, kya unhen paraali jalaane se mukti mili? in sawaalon ke jawaab paane ke liye punjab ke kai hisse main kisaanon se baatcheet karke hakeekat jaanane kii koshish kii
 Punjab has a large number of marginal farmers, so they cannot afford machines like Happy Seeders and Rotavators, which cost anywhere from two lakh to 16 lakh, by spending lakhs of rupees
 duusare, in baari mashiinon ko chalaane ke liye kam se kam 50 harsapower kaa tractor bhi chahie
 Tractors of up to 20 horsepower are commonly used in Punjab farmers
 mashine kisaanon ke liye mahangikisaanon ne bataaya ki pichley saal paraali nasht karne vaali mashiinon kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Most farmers say that only big farmers can afford these machines
 duusare, jo iskaa prayog kar chuke hai, ve kai vajahon se aage iske istemaal ke paksh main nahin hai
 Farmers say that since the government announced a 50 percent subsidy on this machine, manufacturers have doubled its price
 bathinda ke kisaan jasvindar singh kaa kahana he ki happy seader mashin ne dhan kii paraali ko puri tarah se nasht nahin kiya, jisase baad main khet main dimak or duusare keede paidaa hue
 Secondly, if the paddy straw is present in the field, if the wheat is sown in it, then the seeds do not grow properly, because the straw leaves them from contact with the soil
 ise nasht karne kaa ekmaatr rasta he ki ise jala diya jaae
 "jaswinder suggests that the state government should keep its machines and use them to destroy the straw from the fields
 bathinda ke ek or kisaan gurmeet singh, jinhone pichley saal happy seader mashin kaa istemaal kiya tha, unka kahana tha ki mashin ke istemaal kaa parinaam yah hua ki dhan kii paraali ke avshesh kheton main rah gaye, jiske kaaran gehun kii upaj main kam se kam 10 se 15 kilogram prati hectare kii giravat ai
 Machines not able to clean the farm
 Another farmer Iqbal Singh used a rotavator and he says that they will not use it this time as there is a shortage in the machine, it is not able to clean the farm and this will cause wheat There is difficulty in sowing
 kisaanon kaa kahana he ki unhen muaavja dene ke liye rajya sarkaar ke paas dhan kii kami thi
 The state government's proposal to provide assistance of Rs 100 per quintal by the central government is still blowing dust
 vaise bhi dhan kii fasal ugaana kisaanon ke liye zyada phydemand nahin he kyonki isaki laagat lagbhag doguni ho gai he
 It costs at least 16000 per acre and the price of paddy is Rs 1800 per quintal
 ab kheton ko saaf karne ke liye kisaanon ko prati acre 2000 rupee or kharch karnaa pade, yah unhen uchit nahin lagata
 In Bihar, 56 people died due to lightning in several areas with monsoon rains
 monsoon kii barish main amuman aasamaani bijli kegirne kii ghatnaayen yada-kada hi hoti hai
 But in Bihar, scientists are witnessing the lightning incident in many places by linking with the onset of monsoon and hot winds
 bihar main bijli girane se 50 se zyada kii mautamausam vaigyanikon ke mutabik bihar main is samay jameen se teen se chaar kilometre tak oonchai tak hawaaon main uthal-puthal he
 Monsoon winds as they entered Beebihar started to clash with the warm winds of the surrounding area
 isse bihar main bijli kadakane ke saath joardaar barish kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya
 Patna, Kaimur, Rohtas, Chhapra, Katihar, Aurangabad, Madhepura and Purnia are the most affected places due to heavy rain and lightning in Bihar on Monday and Tuesday
 hawa ke aapas main takaraane se bijli girane kii sambhaavnadarasal bengal kii khadi main bane system kii vajah se nam hawaaen do se teen kilometre kii oonchai tak ja rahi hai, ye nam hawaaen jab upar uthati hai to badal banate hai aurajhamatham barishhoti he
 But at this time there is also a strong emphasis of westerly winds above three kilometers in North India
 paanch kilometre kii oonchai tak bah rahi ye pachua hawaaen sukhi hai yani inamen nami kaaphi kam he
 Due to this, there was a collision over moist winds and dry winds over Bihar and it rained but due to this collision, there was a tremendous way in the clouds
 ragad ke chalate joardaar bijli paidaa hui
 Measures to avoid celestial lightning According to m Mahapatra, Additional Director General of the Meteorological Department, there was lightning in many places in Bihar due to friction in the clouds in which people died
 lekinakashiya bijlise bachaa ja saktaa he, sidhaa tarika he ki bijli kadakane ke vakt aap ped ke neeche na jaaen or ho sake to ghar main hi rahen
 Stop using electronic devices

 But this time the incidence of thunderclap has been seen much less in a short time
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki vajrapaat ke bare main sateek anumaan kar paanaa philhal sambhav nahin he
 But one thing can be said with scientific assertion that if you see celestial lightning falling in bad weather, then lightning will not fall on you, because the speed of thunderclap is equal to the speed of light, so if you fall lightning on yourself Can never see
 saal 2003 kii baat he
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister of the country
 unhone mahila diwas ke din apane awaas par mahilaon ke liye ek chaat party rakhi thi
 Sonia was feeling very uncomfortable at this party, but Vajpayee offered to Sonia in her familiar style that all her discomfort was removed
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ko shradhanjali dene ke liye yahaan clic karen8 march, 2003 ko dopaher ke din pradhanmantri nivas 7 res course road (RCR, jise ab lok kalyaan maarg kaha jaataa he) par har kshetra se judi diggaj mahilaayein juty thim

 Despite sitting in the corner, all eyes were on them
 sonia ke body language se aisa lag rahaa tha, jaise ve party kisi tarah nipta kar jaldi se janaa chaahati hon
 She looked a little impatient and defensive
 asal main sonia gandhi thode sankoch main thim
 The Congress did not have the numbers in 1999, but Vajpayee's 13-month government was toppled
 bijepi ne sonia gandhi par yah aarope lagaae the ki unhone desh par chunaav thope die
 Sonia was not comfortable because of this
 lekin vaajapeyi ke liye to yah baat puraani ho gai thi
 Vajpayee, sitting in a deep-necked suit, was sitting on a chair in another corner near the couch
 vah muskaraa rahe the or aisa lag rahaa tha ki sonia kii asahajata kaa kuch maje lene ke mood main the
 He finally broke the silence between the two
 unhone apane mehmaanon kii ore mukhaatib hote hue kaha, 'are, inke liye kuch chaat lao, mahilaon ko chaat pasand hota he
 'there were journalists around
 yah kehane ke baad tatkaaleen pradhanmantri vaajapeyi jor se hans pade or sonia, shila bhi muskaae bina nahin rah pain
 Vajpayee knew how to win the hearts of opponents
 unke bare main purv vitt mantripi
 Chidambaram has rightly said, 'it is not true that Vajpayee had many friends, the truth is that he had no enemy

 Story: Eid comes after thirty days of Eidgadharamzan
 kitna manohar, kitna suhaavna prabhaat he
 There is some strange greenery on the trees, some strange beauty in the fields, some strange redness on the sky
 aaj kaa surya dekho, kitna pyaara, kitna sheethal he, maano sansar ko id kii badhai de rahaa he
 What a stir in the village
 idgah jane kii taiyaariyaan ho rahi hai
 There is no button in anyone's shirt, running to bring needle and tail from the neighborhood house
 kisi ke juute kade ho gaye hai, unamem tel daalane ke liye taili ke ghar bhaaga jaataa he
 Immediately give the bulls mash-water
 idgah se lautate-lautate dopaher ho jaaegi
 Three Kos' walkways, then meeting hundreds of men, offering gifts
 dopaher ke pehle lautnaa asambhav he
 The boys are happiest
 kisi ne ek roza rakhaa he, vah bhi dopaher tak, kisi ne vah bhi nahin, lekin idgah jane kii khushi unke hisse kii chiz he
 Rosé will be for the elderly
 inke liye to id he
 Everyday used to memorize the name of Eid
 aaj vah aa gai
 Now it is early that why people do not go to Idgah
 inhen gruhasthi kii chintaaon se kya prayojan
 Whether or not milk and sugar is in the house for the servicemen, they will eat the services
 vah kya jaane ki abbajaan kyon badahavaas choudhary kaayachali ke ghar daude ja rahe hai! unhen kya khabar ki choudhary aaj ankhen badal len, to yah sari id muharram ho jaae
 Kubera's money is full in his own pockets
 baar-baar jeb se apana khajaanaa nikaalkar ginate hai or khush hokar phir rakh lete hai
 Mahmud counts, one-two, ten-twelve
 uske paas baarah paise hai
 Mohsin has one, two, three, eight, nine, fifteen paise
 inhen anginati paison main anginati chijen laayenge-khilone, mithaiyaan, bigul, gend or jane kya-kya!or sabase zyaada prasann he hamid
 That four-five-year-old poor-skinny, thin-skinned boy, whose father had met cholera last year, and mother would not know why she would have been pale one day
 kisi ko pataa na chalaa, kya beemaari he
 Even if she used to say that
 dil par jo bitati thi, vah dil hi main sahati or jab na saha gaya to sansar se vidaa ho gai
 Now Hamid sleeps in the lap of his old grandmother Amina and is equally happy
 uske abbajaan rupee kamaane gaye hai
 Will bring many bags
 ammijaan allahamiyaan ke ghar se uske liye badi acchhee-acchhee chijen laane gai he, isliye hamid prasann he
 Hope is a big thing and then the hope of children! Their imagination makes a mountain of mustard
 hamid ke paanv main juute nahin hai, sir par ek puraani-dhurani topi, jiskaa gota kaala pad gaya he, phir bhi vah prasann he
 When his Abbazan bags and Ammijan will bring the rules, then he will take out the aspirations of the heart
 tab dekhegaa mahmud, mohsin, nure or sammi kahan se utane paise nikaalenge
 Unfortunate Amina is sitting in her closet crying
 aaj id kaa din or uske ghar main dana nahin
 Had Abid been alive today, would Eid have come and gone like this? She is immersed in this darkness and despair
 kisne bulaayaa tha is nigudi id ko? is ghar main uskaa kaam nahin, lekin hamid! use kisi ke marane-jeene se kya matlab? uske andar prakaash he, baahar aashaa
 Adversity brings all its cause, Hamid's blissful destruction will destroy him
 hamid bheetar jaakar daadi se kahata he-tum darana nahin ammaa, main sabase pehle jaaounga
 Do not be afraid
 gaanv se mela chalaa
 And Hamid was also going with the children
 kabhi sabake sab daudkar aage nikal jate
 Then, standing under a tree, waiting for those with him
 ye log kyon itnaa dhire chal rahe hai? hamid ke pairon main to jaise par lag gaye hai
 Can he ever get tired? Have arrived to the tail of the city
 sadak ke donon ore amiron ke bageeche hai
 a strong boundary wall is present
 pedo main aam or lichiyan lagi hui hai
 Sometimes a boy picks pebbles and targets mangoes
 mali andar se gaali detaa hua nikalataa he
 The boys are one furlong away from there
 khub hans rahe hai
 How the gardener has been made an owl! Now the township was becoming dense
 idgah jane waalon kii toliyaan najar aane lageen
 Wearing one glitzy garment, one riding on aces, some on a motor, all settled in perfumes, all in the heart
 graminon kaa vah chota-sa dal, apni vipannataa se bekhbar, santosh or dhairya main magan chalaa ja rahaa tha
 Everything in the city was unique to the children
 jis chiz kii ore takate, takate hi rah jate
 And again and again, do not warn even when there is the sound of the horn
 hamid to motor ke neeche jate-jate bachaa
 Suddenly Idgah appeared
 upar imali ke ghaney vrikshon kii chaaya he
 Below is the paved floor, on which the floor is spread, and the rows of rosaries have gone from one to the other, to the bottom of the concrete world, where there is no one
 nae aane vaale aakar peeche kii qatari main khadey ho jate hai
 There are no further places
 yahan koi dhan or pad nahin dekhtaa
 Everyone is equal before Islam
 in graminon ne bhi vaju kiya or pichhali pankti main khadey ho gaye
 What a beautiful operation, such a beautiful system! Millions of heads bow together in a frame, then all of them stand together
 ek saath jhukate hai or ek saath ghutanon ke bal baith jate hai
 Many times the same action occurs, such as millions of electric lights lit up simultaneously and extinguished simultaneously and this sequence continues
 kitna apurv drishy tha, jisaki samuhik kriyaayein, vistaar or ananthata hriday ko shraddha, garv or atmanand se bhar detii thim
 As if a formula of brotherhood threads all these souls into one thread
 namaaj khatm ho gai he, log aapas main gale mil rahe hai
 The sweets and toys store is then attacked
 graminon kaa vah dal is vishay main baalkon se kam utsaahi nahin he
 Look, it's a carousel
 ek paisa dekar jaao
 Sometimes you will know going to the sky, sometimes falling on the ground
 charkhi he, lakdi ke hathi, ghode, oont, chhadon se latake hue hai
 Sit down with a penny and enjoy 25 rounds
 mahmud or mohsin, nure or sammi in ghodon or unton par baithte hai
 Hamid is standing far
 teen hi paise to uske paas hai
 To eat a third of his treasury, he can give a river
 khilaunon ke baad mithaiyaan aati hai
 Some have taken vegetables, some have Gulab Jamun, some have Sohan Halwa
 maze se kha rahe hai
 Hamid is isolated from the fraternity
 abhaage ke paas teen paise he
 Don't you eat anything? Lazy looks at everyone with eyes
 mithaiyon ke baad kuch dukaane lohe kii chizon kii hai, kuch gilat or kuch nakli gahanon kii
 There was no attraction for the boys over here
 vah sab aage bad jate hai
 Hamid stops at the iron shop
 kai chimate rakhe hue the
 He thought, Grandma does not have tongs
 tave se rotiyaan utaarti hai, to haath jal jaataa he
 If she takes the tongs and gives it to the grandmother, she will be so happy! Then their fingers will never burn
 ghar main ek kaam kii cheez ho jaaegi
 What are the benefits of toys vyarth main paise karaab hote hai
 He asked the shopkeeper, how much is this tong? The shopkeeper looked at him and no man looked at him and said, "it is not for your business, 'is it sold or not?" Why is it not for sale? And why are you loaded here? "" Why don't you say, how is it worth the money? "" It will cost six? "hamid's heart ached
 ‘thik-thik bataao
 "it will take five pennies to get it right, take it, or else let it be
" Hamid strengthened the heart and said, "take three pennies?" He went ahead, saying that shopkeepers should not listen
 lekin dukandaar ne ghudkiyaan nahin deen
 Called and gave a tong
 hamid ne use is tarah kandhe par rakhaa, maano bandook he or shaan se akadata hua sangiyon ke paas aayaa
 There was a stir in the whole village at eleven o'clock
 meley vaale aa gaye
 Mohsin's younger sister ran and snatched the Bhisti from her hand and, who jumped with joy, Mian Bhisti came down and set Surlok
 is par bhai-bahan main maar-peet hui
 Both cried a lot
 unki amma shor sunakar bigadi or donon ko upar se do-do chaante or lagaae
 Now listen to Mian Hamid
 ameena uski awaz sunate hi daudi or use god main uthaakar pyaar karne lagi
 Sahaja was shocked when he saw the tongs in his hand
 ‘yah chimata kahan tha?’‘maine mol liya he
 "how much money?" ’ameena ne chaati peet lee
 What a foolish boy it was that afternoon, did not eat or drink
 laayaa kya, chimata
 You did not find anything else in the entire fair that brought this iron tongs? Hamid said in a guilty manner - your fingers were burned by the pan, so i took it
 budhiya kaa krodh turant sneh main badal gaya, or sneh bhi vah nahin, jo pragalbh hota he or apni sari kasak shabdon main bikher detaa he
 It was silent affection, very solid, full of juice and flavor
 bachche main kitna tyaag, kitna sadbhaav or kitna vivek he! dusron ko khilonaa lete or mithai khate dekhakar iskaa man kitna lalachaaya hoga! itnaa jabt isse hua kaise? vahaan bhi ise apni budhiya daadi kii yaad bani rahi
 Amina was very glad
 or ab ek badi vicitra baat hui
 Also bizarre with Hamid's tongs
 bachche hamid ne buudhe hamid kaa part khelaa tha
 The old Amina became the girl Amina
 vah rone lagi
 Hamid used to spread prayers and used to drop big drops of tears
 hamid iskaa rahasy kya samajhataa

 pakistan ne aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai main duniya se abtak sirf auki sirf jhooth bolaa he
 He has thrown dust in America's eye and has helped the Taliban immensely
 lekin ek roj uskaa khel pakad liya gaya auki aaj america pakistan ko dagaabaaz kii najar se dekhtaa he
 This is disclosed by an American journalist in his latest book and he has given all the facts to those who have been the head of American intelligence agencies
 america ke paas is baat ke bhi saboot hai ki pakistan ke sena pramukh general kiyani aatankwaadi sanghathan taliban ke himachati hai auki jabase usne sach jaan liya he tab se wo pakistan kii parvaah kiye bagaiyr uski sarhad ke bheetar lagaataar hamale kar rahaa he
 America did not even listen to Pakistan government this time
 23 janvari ko jab north wazeeristaan par america drone ne missile daage the, tab bhi pakistan ne fariyaad kii thi
 In response to his plea, the us-run remote control plane again attacked Pakistan within a week
 pakistan kii sarkaar or netaa america se yahi kehete rahe ki yahaan taliban se paak army ko nipatane do
 But on Monday, the US unmanned ship arrived in Pakistan's Kurram clan and returned with two missiles fired
 america ko ye sachai maaloom ho chuki he ki pakistan kii army dagaabaaz he
 Remote control of drone attacks on Taliban and al Qaeda targets in Pakistan is in the hands of CIA officers sitting in Nevada, about seven thousand miles from Pakistan, and the CIA has found evidence that the Pakistan Army and ISI are traitors
 neuyork times ke chif corespondent david i sanger ne apni kitaab main khulaasa kiya he ki america khufia agency siie or neshnal security agency ne paak army or iesai ke aalaa generalon ke phone colls intercept kiye hai
 It was only after hearing this phone that the cia's brain bell rang that the Pakistani army is the snake of the sleeve for America
 wo ek taraf to taliban or al qaayada ke aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf jang kaa dam bharti he or duusari ore paak army ke aalaa afasar aatankwaadiyon ko pehle hi aagaah kar dete hai ki unke thikaanon par hamalaa hone vaala he
 So the US has decided that no matter how much the government of Pakistan shouts, but the US will no longer leave the nefarious bases of terror
 senger kii pahunch white house or america khufia agenciyon kii sikret file tak rahi he
 Citing one such secret file, he has made a sensational disclosure that the CIA and the National Security Agency tapped the telephone of top officials of the Pakistan Army and ISI
 america khufia agenton ne jo phone sune, unamem ek phone pakistan ke chif of army staff general ashfak parvaiz kiyani kaa bhi tha, jo talibani aatankwaadiyon ko pakistan ke liye apni puunji bataa rahe the
 The US National Security Agency has learned that the Chief of the Pak Army is also a friend of the enemies of the US and the Taliban
 pakistan kii fouj kaa sabase bada afasar taliban ke khoonkhaar aatankwaadiyon kaa maseehaa he
 The most sensational disclosure in this book by Sanger is that American intelligence agencies also tapped the telephone of Pakistan Army Chief
 general kiyani kii phone tanping ke dauraan hi america khufia agenciyon ke saamne benakaab hua paak army or taliban kaa sabase khataranaak conection
 Maulvi Jalaluddin Haqqani, one of the oldest and most feared militants of the Taliban, considers Kiyani, the head of the Pakistan Army, to be valuable in Pakistan's strategy
 america khufia agenciyon ne apane kaanon se kiyani ko ye kehete hue suna ki maulavee jilaluddin hakqaani jaise taliban leaders hamaare stretagic asets hai
 Kiani had a new character in front of two top officers known as Two Mikes in the US intelligence agencies - Mike mcconnell and Mike Hayden
 kiyani par unhen shaq to tabhi ho gaya tha, jab kiyani se unhone aamane-saamne baithkar baaten kii thim
 According to mcconnell, 'in a meeting with Musharraf and Kiyani, i told that Suicide Bombers killed about thirteen hundred people in Pakistan in 2007 and in 2008 that number may have doubled
 maine unhen osama bin laden or uske dipti ke intervyuu kaa hawala diya or babataya ki osama pakistan kii sarkaar kaa takhta palat karne kaa iraadaa rakhata he
 In response, both Musharraf and Kiyani said that they did not know about Osama's interview
 'kiyani ke is jawaab se tu mikes ko daal main kuch kaala nazar aayaa or phir phone par kiyani kii baaten sunne ke baad to paak army kii kaali niyat ke bare main bachaa-khuchaa shaq bhi khatm ho gaya
 mcconnell wrote clearly in his report to the US President, "the Pakistani government is constantly providing arms and other goods to the Taliban and other gang militants, so that these terrorists can go to Afghanistan to attack Afghan and NATO forces
" "paak army kii niyat kaa khot saamne aa jane ke baad hi america ne thaan liya ki ab wo pakistan ko usee ke tareeke se jawaab degaa
 This means an attack on terrorist targets through open friendship and free will
 america ye jaan chukaa tha ki paak army ko bataakar hamalaa karne kaa koi phayda nahin, kyonki hamale kii khabar pehle hi aatankwaadiyon tak pahunch jaaegi
 So now he attacks first and gives notice after that
 david sanger ke is khulaase ko pakistan ke purv raashtrapati parvaiz musharraf ne bakawaas qaraar diya he
 Musharraf was the one who made Kiani the chief of army staff
 musharraf ne puri duniya ko aagaah kiya he ki agar pakistani fouj or iesai kamazor padi, to aatank ke khilaaf jang main haar hona tay he

 Significantly, the importance of this bill is very high for a tax rate across the country

 After the introduction of the new bill directly to the Delhi government, the bill is sure to benefit Delhi
 vajah ye ki dilli main nirmaan yaa menuphaccharing kaa kaam kam hota he or bikri zyada hoti he
 Hence, tax will also come more

 In this, cheap hotels will be exempted from this tax
 ab tak 750 rupee pratidin se adhik kiraaya vasuulne vaale hotalon par yah tex lagata tha
 Now it is proposed to increase this limit to Rs 1500 per day
 hangaamedaar rahegaa 4 divasiy satrahaalanki dilli vidhansabha ke bheetar vipaksh kii sankhya kaaphi kam he
 Despite this, the BJP has made a strategy to surround the government
 vipaksh ke netaa vijendra gupta sarkaar ke taanaashaahee kaamkaaj ke ravaiye ko mudda banaaenge
 He will also raise the issue of how the Kejriwal government is ignoring all the rules
 hangaamaa sattashinam aadmi partybhi karegi
 The decision of the High Court may come on offer
 There is also a possibility of a recent uproar over the decision of the Delhi High Court in which the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi was named the executive head of the capital
 haalanki dilli sarkaar is faisle ke khilaaf supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhata chuki he, lekin vidhansabha ke adhikaron ko lekar is satr main ek prastaav paarit kiya ja saktaa he
 That is, the session is of course 4 days, but the political stirring will be there

 The Law Commission of India has said that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) should be included under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, like other national sports organizations
 kanoon ayog kaa kahana he ki use bisisiai ko is prakaar kii chhot die jane kaa koi kaaran najar nahin aata
 The Law Commission, in its report released on Wednesday in the 'legal Framework: BCCI vice-a-vice RTI Act', has made it clear that BCCI has always been treated as a private organization and that it actually functions as a national sports association
 Does
 loksabhaa main ek bayaan ke anusaar, centre sarkaar pehle se hi bisisiai ko rashtriya khel sangh ke rup main dekh rahi he
 The Commission said in its report, 'when all other organizations involved in the National Sports Federation come under the RTI Act, it is not right to give such exemption to BCCI
 'report main kaha gaya ki agar bisisiai ko nijee sanghathan ke rup main dekha jaataa rahaa he, lekin ise itane varsho tak sarkaar dwaara vitt poshit kiya jaataa rahaa he
 In this case, it gets a tax exemption and a big exemption from the government in the matter of land

 The jersey of Indian cricket players has also been questioned in this report

 The Supreme Court had recently reiterated that the BCCI is an accepted national organization, which has almost monopoly authority to organize cricket competitions in the country
 report main kaha gaya he ki bisisiai se judaa har sanghathan, jo iske niyamon ko puraa karata he
 There is a need to bring all those organizations under the purview of RTI
 BCCI ne diya ye javababisisiai ke ek varisht adhikari ne gopneeyata kii shart par pitiai se kaha , ‘is maamle main bisisiai kii koi bhoomika nahin he
 These are the recommendations of the Law Commission and we will wait for the decision of the government
 jahaan tak hamaari jaankaree he to jab tak sarkaar is par faisla nahin karti tab tak vidhi ayog kii siforishein badhyakaari nahin hai
 So let's see what happens next

 jis din bhartiya junior mahila hockey team ko kaansya padak ke liye match khelnaa tha, bahut kam akhbaaron ne is khabar ko tavajjo di, kyonki shaayad hi kisi ko ummid thi ki yah team bhi koi karnama kar sakati he
 
 
 However, the real 'chak de Girls' created history in Mönchengladbach, Germany
 
 
 jab chah saal pehle, bollywood kii film 'chak de india' release hui thi, usne box offis par tahalaka machaa diya tha
 
 
 Even on the field of cricket, the songs of 'chak De India', which are based on the backdrop of hockey, have been playing for the sake of winning and cheering for victory
 
 
 lekin hockey ke maidan par sachmuch 'chak de' kar dene ke liye bhartiya prashansakon ko lagbhag chah saal intazaar karnaa padaa
 
 
 And now, more hope is bound up with them
 
 
 is jeet ke baad toornament kii behtareen player ke khitaab se nawazi gayi rani rampal kahati hai, "hamaari puri team bahut acchhee he
 
 
 Notably, goalkeeper Bigan Soy gave a terrific performance
 
 
 mujhe lagata he, hamaari jeet se hockey kii tasviir badalegi
 
 
 " vaise yah bhi sach he ki jab ye 'champion' desh waapas ain, to cricketron ko die jane vaale shandaar swaagat ke vipareet na dhol-nagaade baje, na phulmalaayen pahanaai gayi
 
 
 Just a few media persons and a few Hockey India officials were present to welcome him
 
 
 iske baavjood vijetaon ke chehre utsaah se damak rahe the, kyonki pichley 15 saal main to aisa bhi kabhi nahin hua tha ki sirf bhartiya mahila hockey team ke liye media ke log airport pahunche hon
 
 
 The specialty of this team and its members is that 'giving the best in lack' is involved in all of this
 
 
 in ladakiyon main se zyaadaatar ke paas koi naukari nahin he
 
 
 These girls from all corners of the country also defeated the teams who were not considered to be defeated in the tournament
 
 
 kaansya padak paane ke liye inhone england kii us team ko shootout main haraaya, jisane isi toornament main jaisi australia jaisi team ko shikast di thi
 
 
 Captain Susheela Chanhu says, "we always hoped that we would definitely make it to the first four teams
 
 
 hamaari team bahut acchhee he
 
 
 "comments darasal, varsh 1975 ke worldcup main swarna padak hasil karne ke baad se bharat ko hameshaa worldcup padakon kii talash hi rahi, chaahe vah purush team ho, mahila team ho, yaa junior mahila team, worldcup hockey main bharat ke paas ginati ke medal hai
 
 
 India has won a total of four medals in World Cup competitions since 1975
 
 
 varsh 1975 main purush team ne swarna padak jeeta tha, or uske baad varsh 1997 main junior purush team ne rajat padak hasil kiya
 
 
 Then in the year 2001, the junior men's team won the gold medal, and now in the year 2013, our junior women's team has won the bronze medal

 But now this victory has magnified his dreams
 
 
 ab adhikari or corporate jagat bhi maidan par protsaahan ke liye 'chak de' kah den to hockey kii tasviir badal sakati he, kyonki khilaadiyon ne to apana dam dikhaa hi diya he
 
 
 When the Bollywood film 'chak De India' was released six years ago, it created a stir at the box office
 
 
 yahaan tak ki cricket ke maidan par bhi jeet ke liye lalkaarane or josh dilaane kii khatir hockey kii prishthbhumi par bani 'chak de india' ke gane hi bajte rahe hai
 
 
 But Indian fans had to wait almost six years to literally 'chak de' on the hockey field
 
 
 or ab, inase or badi ummiden bandhane lagi hai
 
 
 Rani Rampal, who won the tournament's best player title after this win, says, "our entire team is very good
 
 
 khaskar, golkeeper bigan soy ne shandaar pradarshan kiya
 
 
 i think our win will change the hockey picture
 
 
 " However, it is also true that when these 'champions' came back to the country, unlike the grand reception given to the cricketers, neither at the drums, nor the flowers were worn
 
 
 bas, thode-bahut mediakarmi or hockey india ke chand adhikari inke swaagat ke liye maujuud the
 
 
 Despite this, the faces of the winners were glowing with enthusiasm, because in the last 15 years, there was no such thing that the media people had reached the airport only for the Indian women's hockey team
 
 
 is team or isaki sadasyon kii khaasiyat yah he ki 'kami main behtareen dena' in sabaki fitrat main shaamil he
 
 
 Most of these girls have no job

 To get the bronze medal, he defeated the England team who had defeated the team like Australia in the same tournament

 Since then it seemed that Manveer Gurjar would soon enter Bollywood
 sho ke baad apane intervyuu main manavir ne yah khwaahish jataai bhi thi
 But with this Manveer Gurjar also started getting more offers from TV
 khabar thi ki vah bacchon ko lekar ek kamedi reality sho main manu punjabi ke saath dikhenge
 However, in the meantime, he was also seen outside the office of some film makers

 Bigg Boss10: vijeta manavir gurjar kaa ye he salmaan khan se conectionkhabar he ki manavir popular reality sho 'khataron ke khilaadi' ke sijan 8 ke pehle contestant ban gaye hai
 Actually Manveer was approached for the show a long time ago, on which he has said yes

 But no confirmation has come from their side yet
 big bos ke ghar se baahar aate hi aspataal pahunche manavir gurjar The comments is film ke gane, jaise sheershak geet mubaarakan, hawa-hawa , da gogal song or jat jaguaar jaise sangeet chart main sabase upar hai

 mubaarakan soni pikchars network productions, aswin varde or muraad khetaan kii sine 1 studios dwaara nirmit he or yah 28 july 2017 ko duniya bhar main relies hogi
 No one knows what the real scene is
 south se aae rana daggoobatti parabipasha basukya vaaki lattu ho gai hai yaa phir dam maaro dam ke prachaar ke liye unke afaire ko jamkar hawa di ja rahi he
 Hot scenes first started to be discussed about Rohan Sippy's Dum Maro Dum, then Rana fueled the case by saying that Bipasha is the hottest babe and no one can compete with her
 phir unhone kah daalaa ki bipasha unke liye dost se kahin zyada ahmiyat rakhti hai
 Bipasha, who initially used to blame Rana as a simple and hot boy, has now taken a U-turn in this entire case
 ab ve is baat se khafa bataai ja rahi hai ki unki nijee jindagi ko film ke pramotion se joda ja rahaa he
 It is said that he has also separated himself from the promotion
 magar bipasha ke kuch najdidiyon kaa yakeen kiya jaae to bipasha sachmuch is south indian chhokare par fida hai or jon abraham unke liye beeti baat ban chuke hai
 Now it is difficult to guess how much reality, how much to harvest in this case

 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has made Chhoti Diwali special for Ayodhya residents
 siem yogi adityanath sarayu tat par ram kii padi pahunche, jahaan unke saath logon ne 1 lakh 87 hajaar 213 diye jalaakar nayaa record kaayam kiya
 People gathered in Ayodhya on this occasion
 vahiin is aayojan se uttar pradesh main nishchit hi ek nai parampara kii shuruyaat ho chuki he
 Earlier, Dev Diwali, which happened on the banks of Kashi in the state, was important
 jahaan diwali ke 15 din baad lakhon diye ganga ke tat par jalaae jate rahe hai
 In such a situation, this new attempt of Yogi has started raising the question whether Modi's Kashi has lost its shine in front of Ayodhya of Yogi? is
 is din mahadev kii nagari main 84 ghaaton ko asankhya deepon se sajaayaa jaataa he
 According to an estimate, about 1 in various ghats and temples of the city on this day
 25 lakh diye jalaae jate hai
 In such a situation, if you compare it with the celebration of Yogi Adityanath's small Diwali on Saryu coast, then the brightness of Dev Deepawali is less visible
 aapako bataa den ki ayodhya main is baar 1 lakh 87 hajaar 213 diye roshan kiye gaye
 However Vinod Prajapati, who made the diyas, said that 2 lakh diyas were ordered
 ek diye main 50 gram tel daalaa gaya tha
 The shining of Aarti was illuminated on the coast of Saryu, on one side where the river Aarti was performed with 5100 lamps on the Saryu coast
 15 minute tak maa sarayu kaa pujan or abhishek kiya gaya
 CM Yogi Adityanath also attended it
 vahiin is aayojan kii kaashi main hone vaale ganga kii mahaarati se tulana ho rahi he
 About the special aarti to be held on the day of Dev Deepavali at Dashashwamedh Ghat, Shivam, the PRO of the Ganga Seva Nidhi, said that these 21 Brahmins perform the Maha Aarti of Mother Ganga with 1071 diyas
 unke saath 42 kanyaayein riddhi-siddhi ke rup main rahati hai
 Shivam told that the musical aarti started at Dashashwamedh Ghat on November 15, 1997 in Kashi
 dhire-dhire isaki lokapriyata badhati hi chali gai
 In Banaras, a grand aarti is organized daily by law
 khaskar dev deepawali ke din yah aarti kaaphi khaas hoti he
 The sight of the aarti amidst the chanting, the sound of conchs and bells is very amazing
 isamen kai badi or namchin hastiyaan bhi isamen shaamil hoti hai
 He informed that special preparations have been made for this event on November 4 this year as well
 is aayojan main upi kii paryaton mantri reeta bahuguna joshi or kendriya samskruti mantri mahesh sharma shaamil ho sakate hai
 Importance of small Diwali of Saryu CM Yogi Adityanath has organized this little Diwali on the Saryu coast, taking a pledge to establish a Ram Rajya in the country
 apane bhaashan main yogi ne kaha ki PM modi ke netritv main desh shashakt ban rahaa he, ram-rajya kii pariklpana ko ham saakaar karenge
 At the same time, Yogis are also cherishing the dream of development of Ayodhya on the pretext of this event
 yahi vajah he ki unhone ghoshnaa kii ki ayodhya main 113 karod kii yojanaayen shuru ho rahi hai
 To give grandeur to the event, Yogi himself reached Ramakatha Park with Lord Rama, Sita and Lakshmana
 kaashi kaa yogi se ummid, dev deepawali bhi banegi khaaskarthik poornima ke din bhagwaan bholenath ne tripur naamak daitya kaa vadh kiya or apane haathon basaai kaashi ke ahamkaari raja divodas ke ahankaar ko nasht kar diya
 After the demon was killed, the gods celebrated by lighting a lamp from heaven to their city of Kashi
 devgan utsav hone ke kaaran isedev deepavalinam diya gaya
 Since then, this festival was celebrated by lighting a lamp on the ghats of Kashi on the occasion of Kartik Purnima
 vartmaan main dev deepawali kii chata dekhne lakhon videshi or desi paryatak kaashi pahunchate hai
 Shivam told that it is believed that seeing the Ganges Aarti during Dev Diwali gives salvation
 yogi ke ayodhya kaarykram ke bare main sivam ne kaha ki isse kaashi ke mahatvata par koi kami nahin pahunchane vaali
 However, he expected CM Yogi Adityanath to try Ayodhya like Kashi and also give message of establishment of Ram Rajya to Kashi
 a post shared by Divya Agarwal (@divyaagarwal_official) on Jul 28, 2018 at 5:14am PDTA post shared by “baba bhauaneeti” BOB MARLEY (@suyyashrai) on Jul 27, 2018 at 7:15am PDT Former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha says that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in tune to create history every day and if he can become the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Timbuktu, he will definitely do so whether his visit is necessary and meaningful
 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke purv netaa ne apni pustak 'india anamed : hou modi gavarment broke da economi' main beete saadhe 4 saal main modi or unki sarkaar par ek sadma dene vaale adhyay main kaha he ki ek cheez he jo unhone kii lekin duusare pradhanmantriyon ne nahin kii
 Sinha said that he (PM Modi) took most of the previous events under his purview and changed his name, adding all the credit and pride to him
 bhaajapa nit sarkaar ke aalochak sinha ne yah pustak un sabhi ko samarpit kii he, jo sach ke saath aage aane se darate nahin hai
 He said, "modi is a man who wants to do all things for himself
" "'hell sijar : modi style of functioning' adhyay main naukarshah se rajaneta bane 81 varshiya sinha ne kaha, "modi ne bharat sarkaar kii sabhi nirnay nirmaan shaktiyon ko khud main hi kendrikrut kar diya he, jisamen unke pradhanmantri karyaalay ke kuch chuninda adhikari unki sahaayta karte hai
 "sinha was the finance and foreign minister in the Vajpayee government
 patrkaar aditya sinha ke saath sah-likhit pustak main sinha ne kaha, "haalanki vah dher sari filon ke padhane ke bajaae power panit pregentation main ruchi rakhane ke liye jane jate hai
 it's sad
 iskaa matlab he ki vah sansthagat smriti main jamaa baarikiyon ko nahin jaananaa chaahate
 Perhaps it is suitable for a person who lacks caution in intellectual training (in fact, one does not see his or her higher education degree in political science as a whole)
 "unhone kaha ki bharat sarkaar kaa prashasan teen kendron dwaara chalaaya ja rahaa he, pehla pradhanmantri or unka karyaalay, doosraa vitt mantri or unka karyaalay or teesraa niti ayog
 Earlier a politician often chaired the Planning Commission but now he is silent and has been replaced by NITI Aayog where Modi has placed people who have zero influence on the government
 unhone kaha ki isse sarkaar ke do chaalak ho gaye hai
 The veteran politician said that everyone knows how the finance minister has influence in the government, which cannot be denied that there are almost zero and he is not able to emphasize things in his own ministry
 unhone kaha, "aakhirkaar, kyon unke vitt sachiv hasmukh adhiya badnaam notebandi ke faisle main shaamil the, vitt mantri khud andhere main the
 The Finance Secretary's proximity to the Prime Minister dates back to Gujarat
 "unhone kaha modi durbhagyavash ek aise vyakti hai, jo sansthaanon ke liye betaab hai
 His belief in himself has blinded him to the fact that he is not a king, he is the head of only one parliamentary party which has a majority, which enables him to form a government and the limits of that government in the Constitution
 Are determined
 sinha ne kaha ki cabinet samuhik rup se sansad ke prati jimmedaar he

 housephul 4 ko bollywood kii sabase mahangi film bataai ja rahi he
 a Goa court has framed charges against Tehelka founder journalist Tarun Tejpal in a sexual harassment case
 court ke is faisle ne tarun kii mushkilen badha di hai
 Using his pen and intelligence camera, Tarun created panic all over the country
 bade-bade khulaase kar satta ke galiyaaron main sansani failaai
 He got such an identity that people started trusting him blindly
 lekin barason kii kamai, naam or shoharat ko bas ek kadam ne barbaad kar diya
 Tarun Tejpal, who was accused of sexually abusing his own team of female journalists, has now escaped the law
 7 november, 2013, shanivaar ko goa ke ek five star hotel main tahalaka kaa think fest chal rahaa tha
 Many famous faces of the world were part of this fest, including Tehelkake editor-in-chief and noted journalist Tarun Tejpal
 or inhen namchin chehron ke bich ek cheharaa us gumnaam ladki kaa bhi tha, jo ai to thi is fest main apni duty nibhaane, lekin isse pehle kii wo apana ferj adaa kar yahaan se lautati, wo khud apane hi bos tarun tejpal ke napak iraadon kaa shikaar ban gai
 According to the girl, Tejpal tortured not one, but two or two times and threatened the bad consequences of opening his mouth
 tahalaka kii managing editor shoma choudhary se kii gai shikaayat ke baad jab is ladki ne goa police ko apane saath beeti puri kahani bataai, to sunne vaale bas sunate hi rah gaye
 Because it was that face of Tejpal, which nobody had seen till now
 goa police ko die ladki ke bayaan ke mutabik, us raat jab vah ek guest ko uske kamare tak chhod kar waapas laut rahi thi, to isi hotel ke block 7 ke ek lift ke saamne use uske bos tarun tejpal mil gaye
 Tejpal suddenly asked the guest to wake him up and dragged him back inside the same lift, but now this girl could understand that in the meantime, Tejpal started pressing the elevator button so that neither the elevator stopped nor the door Open
 or tab tejpal ne isi band lift main jo kuch kiya, jab uske raaj khule to aksar apane sting oparation or khulaason kii badaulat siyaasi halkon main tahalaka machaane valetarun tejpalki jindagi main hi tahalaka much gaya
 Tejpal's daughter is a good friend
 In a statement given to the police, the victim girl told that Tarun Tejpal then started molesting her in the lift
 tejpal kii ye harakat uske liye jitna bada jhatka tha, kahin usase bhi bada sadma, kyonki ab tak wo tejpal ko apane pita kaa dost maanati rahi thi or khud tejpal kii beti uski acchhee dost he
 According to the victim girl, when Tejpal was torturing her in a closed lift, she was crying about these relationships
 or to or usne tejpal ko unki beti se apni dosti kii yaad dilaai, lekin tejpal ke sir par jaise koi bhoot savaar tha
 The situation became such that when the lift stopped after a while, he somehow managed to get out of the lift by taking care of his clothes, but this was not the end of this girl's troubles
 duusari baar bhi lift main hi kii thi chhedhkhanius raat to is ladki ne apane phone par apane bwoyfrand ke alaava doston ko is vaakye ke bare main bataaya, lekin agle din mauka milte hi phir se usee hotel kii ek lift main tejpal ne uske saath vahi harakat doharaai or ab uske liye ye sabakuch bardaasht se baahar ho chukaa tha
 And after this, this girl told her best friend and Tejpal's daughter the complete misdeeds of her father
 lekin jaanate hai, tab tejpal kii beti ne kya jawaab diya, ladki kii maane to usne kaha ki usne pehle bhi apane pita ko tab ek duusari aurat ke saath aisa karte dekha tha, jab uski umr sirf 13 saal kii thi
 Till now only talk was being done about sexual exploitation
 ilzaam lag rahe the, ilzaamon kaa jawaab dhundha ja rahaa tha
 But whatever happened now is sure to be overshadowed by Tarun Tejpal
 ek taraf dilli hai court ne tejpal kii agrim zamaanat kii arzi par faisalaa 29 november tak surakshit rakhaa he, vahiin duusari taraf peedit ladki ne goa main magistrate ke saamne tejpal kii karatuuton kaa kaccha-chittha khol kar rakh diya he
 After registering a formal complaint with the Goa Police, the victim girl went to Goa and recorded a statement in front of the magistrate as well
 yon shoshan or balaatkaar ke aarope main tarun tejpal kii giraftaar kaa countdown shuru ho chukaa he
 On the complaint of the victim girl, Goa police has already issued summons to Tarun Tejpal to attend the Dona Paula police station of Panaji
 magistrate ke saamne bayaan darj karaane ke baad ab giraftaar kaa warrant kabhi bhi jari ho saktaa he
 In a 22-page statement given to the magistrate, the girl has told full details
 kya-kya hua, ladki ne diya tha byoraa7 or 8 november kii raat think fest main uske saath kya-kya hua, apane bayaan main ladki ne saaf kiya he ki jo bhi hua uski marji ke khilaaf hua
 Tejpal is being defamed by raising the consent point
 usne think fest main maujuud tahalaka ke sahakarmiyon se baatcheet kaa byoraa bhi diya he
 Apart from this, he has also submitted a copy of SMS and email sent to Tejpal
 bayaan main ladki ne ye bhi kaha he ki managing editor shoma choudhary ne uski koi madad nahin kii
 Rather, pressure was also made on Tejpal's relatives not to give a statement to the police
 bijepi sarkaar par lagaaya tha aaropagova police ke mutabik, ladki kii shikaayat or magistrate ko diya bayaan ghatana ke baad tahalaka prabandhan ko bheje i-mail se match karte hai
 Tejpal may change his statement about the incident, but the victim girl is adamant on his statement
 goa police apni taraf se shuruaati tafteesh or tejpal par kanoonee shikanja kasne kii puri kar chuki he
 But Tejpal and his close ones say that they are being implicated and this is being instigated by the BJP government of Goa
 lekin goa ke mukhyamantri manohar parrikar ne un aaropon ko sire se khaarij kiya
 However, the answer to the question of the Chief Minister's arrest was deferred
 ye kehete hue ki ye police kaa maamla he or ise un par hi chhod dena behatar he
 Action has begun
 tejpal ke goa police ke saamne hajir hone kaa saman bhi jari ho chukaa he
 Police say that if Tejpal ignores summons, a non-bailable warrant will be issued against him
 tejpal aahista-aahista kaanoon ke jaal main aise funs rahe hai ki aane vaale vakt main khuli hawa main saans lenaa unke liye khwab sabit ho saktaa he
 The Delhi High Court did not get relief at the moment and on the other hand the Goa police sent summons for questioning and asked them to appear in the same Goa as the scandal
 is puure maamle kii jaanch goa police kii krime branch kar rahi he
 The case of rape was registered by the Goa police after Tejpal's sexual abuse case
 iske baad goa police tejpal se poochtacha ke liye unke dilli sthit ghar bhi ai, lekin koi poochtacha nahin hui
 Meanwhile, it is clear from the stand of the Goa government that it is not going to leave the case like this
 paisa bhi khub kamayatarun tejpal ne patrakarita ko ek nai pahchaan di
 Made major disclosures through the sting operation
 lekin patrakarita ke oonche paaydaanon par chadhane ke saath hi unhone apana kaarobaar bhi tezi se failaayaa
 Tejpal, the owner of crores, was now walking in the club and resort business, but suddenly his stars reached greed
 khabaren parosane vaale shaks ke khud khabaron main aane ke baad ab har kisi kii nazren tejpal kii sampatti ke dher kii ore bhi mud chuki hai kyonki ye baat bhi saamne aa rahi he ki unhone tahalaka main rahete hue acha-khaasaa kaarobaari samrajya khadaa kar diya he

 Supporting the remarks of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Parliament on demonetisation, CPI (M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury on Saturday called Prime Minister Narendra Modi 'narendra Modi' for remaining silent on the issue

 Yechury said that demonetisation will have a profound impact on the Indian economy, because now it will take at least six months to get things right
 unhone kaha ki is avadhi ke baad jaali note, kaala dhan kaa prasar hoga or bhrashtachar jari rahegaa
 The comments yechuri ne kaha ki bharat main notebandi bilkul alag cheez he, kyonki desh kii aabaadi 1

 He said that fake currency, black money will spread after this period and corruption will continue

 The At the same time, Congress leader Asif Mohammad says that the police have arrested AAP leaders red handed

 The panchayat's first session of mahamanthan on Maharashtra elections was held with Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray
 isaki shuruyaat shivasena ke vijan document ke saath hui
 Soon after, Uddhav made an election announcement
 unhone kaha ki unki sarkaar ai to wo aathvin tak ke bacchon ko teb denge jisase rajya main shiksha kii sthiti main sudhaar aayega
 Uddhav said, 'balasaheb expressed concern over the burden of children's bags
 kaha, ye kya he, jaanavar bana rakhaa he bacchon ko
 So i decided to save the children from the burden of baggage
 maine sochaa he ki mahayuti sarkaar banane par aathvin class se bacchon ko teb de duungaa
 If two money is being spent for education, then it should be done
 shiksha sabase jaruri he
 There will not be any student who will not study
 agar wo skool nahin jayega to skool uske paas aayega
 For the last three years we have started visual study in the schools of the municipality
 maharashtra ke 400 skulon main iske jariye bachche pard rahe hai
 When Uddhav was asked if he was the face of the public? He said, 'the wave of Delhi is all over the country
 desh badlaav chahta tha
 When he came to Delhi before the elections, he said that the country needs a face
 desh kaa netaa koun banegaa? to narendra bhai saamne aae
 Got success ab maharashtra kii baat ai he
 So people need a face

 Asked if your colleagues want to change the face, Uddhav said, 'I did not think that the BJP wants to change the face
 faisla to logon ko karnaa he
 Those who want to change their face, find the reason for people's trust in us
 phir badlaav kii sochen
 There are 54 tainted people in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly
 jab uddhav se yah poocha gaya ki wo daagiyon par kya kar rahe hai
 He said, 'I see in the advertisement that the stains look good
 unke upar jo cese he, unke upar jo daag he wo janata ke liye ladaai ladate hue mili hai
 You will call them tainted
 to main kahuunga ki mujhe un par abhimaan he
 Stains are good if fighting while fighting for the public
 magar aarthik yaa kisi or kism ke ghotaale kii baat he, to aise logon ko jail main janaa hoga
 'he said,' The law of the country has been in existence since the British era
 unke jamaane main jo hamaare krantikari the unhen to faansee tak hui
 This law must be changed
 shiv sena kitni siton par chunaav ladengi or bijepi kitne par ye poochne par uddhav ne majaak main kaha, ‘charchaa abhi jari he
 We will not fight on as many seats as we do
 ’ iske baad unhone gambhirtha se kaha, ‘har kisi kaa sapana hona chahie ki apni party aage bade
 When the time comes, it will be decided well
 ground reality he usko dekhte hue faisla hoga
 It is the only alliance in the world which has been running for 25 years
 ’uddhav ne panchayat aaj tak ke mahamanch se yah ghoshnaa kii ki wo maharashtra kaa jo hissaa karnataka main he use waapas lekar aaenge
 Uddhav said, 'the people there are from Maharashtra
 jab vibhaajan hua unhone galati kii
 i say make that area central
 maharashtra main hamane kabhi kisi par bhashaa kii jabardastee nahin kii
 When asked about the province in Mumbai, he said, "when we do, it seems to be regionalism

 The Uri, Pathankot and Sunjwan attacks happened while guarding
 'umr abdulla ne kathith taur par sena dwaara esadm ko peetane kii ghatana kii aalochana kii he
 Abdullah described the army's decision to block highway as a dictatorial attitude
 neshnal confrence is mudde ko rajyapal ke saamne kai baar uthaa chuki he
 However, the BJP team is standing very strongly against the allegations of opposition
 jab congress ne chaukeedaar chor he kaa naaraa diya, bijepi ne tatkaal hi nayaa naaraa bana diya chaukeedaar pyor he
 bjp's reply did not stop here, all the big leaders of BJP at the national level added the name 'chowkidar' in front of their name under 'main Bhi Chowkidar' campaign

 Omar Abdullah also tweeted against PM Modi's attack on dynasty during a rally in Kathua
 unhone twit kiya tha- 'modi ji kehete hai- hamen in donon raajnneetik pariwaron (abdulla or mufti parivaar) se jammu-kashmir ko chhutkaaraa dilaanaa he
 But in the year 2014, BJP made not one, but two members of the Mufti family, the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir
 ab 2019 main modi kah rahe hai, ‘hamen in donon raajnneetik pariwaron se jammu-kashmir chhutkaaraa paanaa hoga

 ' Do you also want to build a body like Bollywood actor Salman Khan or Hollywood actor Sylvester Stellan? If you are planning to go to the gym for body building, then there is an advice for you
 aap baari-bharkam vajan uthaane ke bajaay kam vajan uthaayenge to behatar laabh paaenge
 According to researchers at MAC Master University in Canada, when you go to the gym to build a body, lifting less weight is more effective than lifting heavy weights
 ‘da daily telegraph’ ne khabar di he ki apane adhyayan main shodhakartaaon ne paaya he ki kam vajan uthaane se adhik baar abhyaas kiya ja saktaa he
 The author, who led the study, said that the rest of the protocols can be effective in body building exercises, and you can get stronger muscles after resistance training

 unka maananaa he ki lords main guuruuvaar se shuru hone vaali shrunkhlaa main bharat ko haraane ke liye unki team puri tarah se sakasham he
 "I am surprised by this, when people wonder that we are talking about becoming the world's number one team," said Flower

 If not, then you are underestimating yourself

 Bunty (rupendra Verma) and Babli (shalini Verma), who have made millions in the name of appointing Babu, typist, telephone operator and peon in the Chhattisgarh ministry, Mahanadi Bhavan and Indravati Bhavan, have been arrested by the police
 maamle main shalini verma, roopendra verma or baby raav ko bhi giraftaar kiya gaya he
 Baby Rao used to trap customers
 ye log vaise to saikadon logon ko chuunaa laga chuke hai, lekin chaalaaki se rakam lene yaa phir nakadi sweekaar karne ke chalate bachate rahe
 This time, two youths from 12th and Graduate Pass were opened by taking about 15 lakh rupees in the name of giving jobs in the ministry
 inaki giraftaar ke baad rajya ke vibhinn ilaakon se saikadon peedit berozegaron ne thagi kaa shikaar hone kii shikaayat apane najdiki thanon main darj karai
 These unemployed were expected to get their jobs in the ministry from the back door, but when the jobbers were seen visiting the lockup, the cheated unemployed were seen rubbing their hands
 thagi karne vaale banty, bubbly or unki team ne raipur ke devendra nagar main inkalev group ke naam se ek rojgaar karyaalay khol rakhaa tha
 It is alleged that these people used to call the unemployed youth here and show them a dream of getting jobs and then used to make huge money in the name of bribing the officers
 rojaanaa 25 berozegaar hote the thagi kaa shikarbataya ja rahaa he ki shalini verma or roopendra verma donon pati-patni hai, jabaki baby raav unka kareebi dost he
 These three used to run this group
 shalini echaar head thi or company aane vaale berozegaron ko unki yogyata ke anusaar vibhinn sarkari daftaron main naukari dilaane kaa jhansa detii thi
 Every day there were 20-25 unemployed workers in this office
 naukari paane ke liye pahunchate the berozegarainke paas shahari or gramin ilaakon se naukari paane ke liye aane waalon kaa jamaavada laga rahata tha
 In view of the financial condition of the unemployed, the transaction was fixed
 dhamtari ke joraatrai ke rahane vaale trivendra kumaar ne raipur ke thana devendra nagar main dhokhadhadi kii shikaayat darj karai thi
 Trivendra told that he had come to know about the Enclave Group Private Limited Company through a relative a year ago
 iske baad vah naukari ke liye yahaan pahunchaa tha, jahaan uski mulaakaat shalini se hui
 Shalini told him that he has good reach in the ministry and he is close to many ministers and officers of the state
 shalini ne unako chah maheene ke bheetar naukari dilaane kaa aashwaasan diya or iske evaj main 70 hajaar rupee maange
 Trivendra deposited 70 thousand rupees in the company's account and also submitted documents related to his qualification for the job in the office
 tay samay par bhi jab peediton ko naukari nahin mili, to unhone aropiyon se sampark kiya, lekin aropiyon ne na to unka phone uthaaya or na hi unase dobaaraa sampark kiya
 Fraud of 16 lakhs in one day, when Trivinder realized that he was cheating, he lodged a complaint in the police station Devendra Nagar
 police ne teenon aropiyon ko giraftaar kar liya he
 The accused have confessed to cheating not only Trivendra, but 15 lakh 75 thousand rupees from 20 people on that day
 yah rakam ek hi din unke bank acount main jamaa hui thi
 According to the police, the accused duped people from several cities including Mahasamund, Dhamtari, Bilaspur, Gariaband, Balodabazar besides Raipur
 police ne bataaya ki is maamle ke darj hone ke baad unke paas lagbhag do darjan logon ne nai shikaayatein kii
 All these are also being investigated
 police ne aropiyon ke daftar se mili computer laptop or mobile ko bhi jabt kar liya he
 Police believe that the entire network was working to carry out these incidents
 police ko ab bhi aath se 10 aise agento kii talash he, jo banty or bubbly ke is giroh ke liye graahak dhundne kaa kaam karte the
 Being a good horseman brought them into the Union
 sunne main ajeeb lag saktaa he, lekin yah sach he
 The incident is from 1970 or '71
 college ke samay main jab sangh kaa path sanchalan vaala ghoda bidak rahaa tha to unki ghudsawaari kii kala se waakif ek shaks ne ghoda sanbhaalane ko kaha
 But then he did not have the uniform of the Sangh

 Om Prakash Mathur, 62, tall and tough, has so far held the responsibility of those states in the BJP where the party loses, which is in crisis
 khaali vakt main ve rajasthan ke paali jile kii bali tehsil ke apane dedh sau acre khet main hytech kheti karte hai
 While showing videos of rose farming, papaya, lemon etc
 on his ipad, Mathur says that he has received several national awards for farming
 sada jivan or khaane main sirf daal-roti pasand karne vaale maathur kii khaasiyat he ki ve tathyon ke aadhaar par thasak ke saath apni baat kehete hai, chaahe saamne vaala shaks narendra modi kyon na ho
 But on the question of being a Rajya Sabha MP only once in politics and remaining isolated for the rest of the time, he says that isolation is that which is weak
 apane jameer se kabhi samajhaita nahin karne vaale maathur apni pahchaan ko modi yaa amit shah se jodakar dekhnaa pasand nahin karte
 In 2002, Uma Bharti was accepted as the Chief Ministerial candidate in Madhya Pradesh as the in-charge after increasing bjp's base through organization skills in Rajasthan, ending the party's infighting in Gujarat, recently parting ways with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra
 Mathur, who created bjp's glory, has now been given the responsibility of a big state like UP
 narendra modi ke sabase khaas ranneetikaar maane jane vaale maathur neindia tudeke pramukh samvaadadatasantosh kumarase vishesh baatcheet kii
 Excerpts from the conversation with him: The BJP has given you the task of the biggest goal Mission UP
 ise kitni badi chunauti maanate hai?dekhie, chunauti to bahut badi he, isamen do raay nahin he
 The party relied heavily on me, giving responsibility for UP, which has 403 members
 mukhya rup se main sanghathan kaa aadmi hum
 i accept this challenge and will try to sit with the UP team and get success in the upcoming elections
 jaisi loksabhaa main mili he
 Modi's development agenda in UP in the Lok Sabha elections, but three months later in the assembly by-election, Yogi Adityanath made the issue of hard Hindutva and lost the party
 aise main aapaki ranneeti kya hogi?nishchit rup se ham 11 main 9 seat haare hai
 There must have been some reason somewhere
 uskaa vishleshan karenge
 But what Narendra Modi has given us the vision of development, we will have to move forward in UP with the same vision
 kya bijepi upi main koi mukhyamantri project karegi?jahaan tak meri vyaktigat raay he to mujhe nahin lagata ki bijepi is tarah kaa koi vichaar karegi
 But the party has kept some thinking, then i can give a right answer on this only by talking to the party
 pehle bijepi rajyon main cheharaa project karke aage badhati thi
 But now that it is not seen doing so, has the BJP also become a Congress? It should not be called a Congress
 acha rajnatik dal vahi hota he jo vartmaan rajnatik paristhatiyon ko dhyaan main rakhkar nirnay kare
 You are from a union background
 bijepi-sangh kabhi vyakti kendrit nahin rahe
 Why is everything seen revolving around Modi right now? i would like to correct you
 sahi he ki chijen modi ke ird-gird gum rahi hai
 But Modi is also the first party worker
 unhone bhi apana vyaktitv kaaryakarta ke naate hi viksit kiya he
 The land that Modi has dug in Gujarat as an activist for 12 years and the subjects he has put before the country, he was the chief and his credit goes to him naturally
 lekin vijan vahi he jo sangh main unhone bachapan main siikhaa, vijan he— sabko saath lekar chalane kaa
 It is totally wrong to call Modi a person who runs a cleanliness campaign in the name of Gandhiji, who should take care of health in children in the name of Nehru
 modi sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas kii baat karte hai
 But Muslim society is still avoiding them
 upi main aap unka bharosa kaise jeetenge?muslim samaaj ko bijepi ke bare main kai prakaar se bargalaaya gaya he
 But gradually we should instill faith in them, build trust and if you want to see the scene then you should go to Gujarat, where Muslim people vote for BJP in large numbers
 menka gandhi ne varun gandhi ko siem project karne kii baat kahi thi
 
 
 i feel that no senior leader or official in the political field should make his personal views public
 loksabhaa main upi kii jeet kaa shrey amit shah ko diya gaya, jabaki gujarat main aapane prabharee rahete sabhi 26 siten jitwaain
 Your name also came in the race for the post of President, but Shah Baji was killed
 aapako lagata he, kahin kasar rah gai?main ise koi kasar nahin maanata
 We are all just instruments, whether Amit Shah or me
 main aapako bataaun ki 13 sitambar, 2013 ko modi ko piem ummidavaar ghoshit kiya gaya or 10 may, 2014 tak us vyakti ne tapasya kii he
 He did 5,800 shows alone
 puure deshbhar main us vyakti ne jan jaagran kiya
 We were just instruments
 isliye adhyaksh koi bhi bane, amit bane yaa main banataa to bhi or koi bhi banataa to bhi
 It is not important in our party
 lekin modi ne saarvajanik manch se main of da match amit shah ko kaha
 
 
 
 thik he naa, aakhir itane bade pradesh main amit ne sabase adhik siten jitain
 Modi ji has also thanked me
 upi main aapkaa muqabla bispi se he yaa sapa se?rajnatik dal chunavi yuddh main jaataa he to muqabla chote-bade, har dal se maanata he
 He goes on alert because there can be an attack from all four sides
 meri party har akraman kaa kaise muqabla kare, main sirf uski chintaa karuunga
 You are considered to be an expert in coordination politics, but why does he not appear in coordination home with Vasundhara ji? i have come to Vasundhara ji's breakfast yesterday
 ye sari baaten media uchhaalata he
 i never get into these little things
 lekin abhi vasundhara ke khaas maane jane vaale lalit modi ne twit kiya, maathur ko rajasthan kaa siem banaaya janaa chahie?pataa nahin, kyon kiya
 Know what he wrote meraa lalit modi se koi parichay nahin he
 You are considered lucky in charge, what is your special strategy? Only someone with a weak mindset believes in things like Lucky

 agar homework ho or thodaa saamaajik, rajnatik sameekaran kaa dhyaan rakho to janata saath detii he
 You are constantly being given great responsibility and there is a discussion that in future you can be made CM of Rajasthan
 maine in sab chizon kii kabhi apeksha nahin rakhi, na narendra modi se, na bhagwaan se
 Therefore, i do not want to answer the questions of agar-mugger
 aap par maharashtra main shivasena gathbandhan todgaye kaa iljaam lag rahaa he
 What will i say? i want to tell you that sitting with Uddhav and me for an interview, then milk will become milk, water will be water
 lekin aarope lagaate hai to main use sweekaar karata hum
 The sangh-bjp relationship has always been questioned that it interferes
 sarkaar shram sudhaar se isi dabaav main peeche hati he, aapako kya lagata?yah sab aap logon kii dharna he
 Modi himself is a volunteer of the Sangh
 sangh kabhi bijepi ke kisi kaam main dakhal nahin detaa
 The Sangh is our guide and we advise from time to time
 main bhi 40 saal se raajnneeti main hum
 In charge of territories

 nai peedi khadi nahin hui
 So will you make some fundamental changes? We will get the benefit of the experience of the old people

 But the ministers are also afraid to work without their instructions
