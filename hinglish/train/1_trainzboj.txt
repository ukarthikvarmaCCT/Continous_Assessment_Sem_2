 paanch saal tak badi company main naukari or moti selary paane ke baad vinod kumaar ne sochaa ki aisi jindagi kaa kya matlab he jisamen aap na chaiyn se so paaen or na hi ghar kaa khaanaa kha paaen
 Between the deadline and the target, he felt very suffocated in his life
 or phir kaaphi sochane-samajhane ke baad unhone naukari se brake lene kaa faisla kiya
 Around the year he roamed various parts of India, which proved to be quite good for him
 unhone mahasoos kiya ki ab vakt apni jadon se judane kaa he or unhone krishi se judane kaa faisla kiya
 Vinod says that while he was roaming the rural areas of the country, he found that the farmers of the country were able to grow as much vegetables or grains as their family could eat, due to not being able to afford the fertilizer
 vinod ne ghoomane ke baad naukari chhod di or waapas apane jile kanchipuram aa gaye
 After struggling for a year, he currently has six acres of land, in which he grows maize, barley and many vegetables without using any chemical fertilizer

 rohingya sharnaarthiyon ko desh kii aatanrik suraksha ke liye khatra bataate hue bharat sarkaar ne avaidh rup se rah raherohingyaonko waapas myanmar bhejne kii baat jarur kahi he, lekin sarkaar ke saamne sabase badi chunauti yah he ki aakhir in logon ko waapas bheja bhi jaae to aakhir kaise?philhal sarkaar is samasya se nipatane ke liye rasta khoj rahi he
 According to the government report, 40 thousand Rohingya are living illegally in India
 ye rohingya jammu, haryana, uttar pradesh, rajasthan samet dilli or ensiaar main rah rahe hai
 These people have been accused of connection with terrorists
 isi vajah se anya desh bhi inhen sharan dene ko raji nahin dikh rahe
 After the violence spread in Myanmar, the Rohingya have illegally settled in many countries including India, Thailand, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, but no country except Thailand has been able to send them back
 darasal, thailand ne rohingyaon ko waapas bhejne ke liye ek alag rasta nikaala
 What Thailand did 
 
 2014 main thailand ne rohingyaon ko waapas bhejne kaa farmaan jari kiya tha
 After which 1300 Rohingyas have been repatriated so far
 thai othorities ne rohingyaon ko swechha se waapas bhejne kaa nirnay kiya tha
 To put it simply, Thailand gave the Rohingyas a leeway to decide how to go back
 us vakt thailand main rohingyaon ko nirvasit karne kii jimmedaari sambhaal rahe leftinent general farnu kardalarphone ne api ko bataaya ki, "hamane rohingyaon ko unki ichha ke anusaar 100 se 200 ke group main bheja
 He believed that the Rohingya do not see their future in Thailand
 isiilie hamane unhen waapas bhej diya
 "however, Thailand was severely criticized by human rights organizations for repatriating Rohingyas in this way
 kyon apane hi desh se bhaag rahe hai rohingya
 
 
 It is known that the Rohingya population in Myanmar is close to 1 million
 rohingya samudaay 15veen sadi ke shuruaati dashak main myanmar ke rakhin ilaake main aakar bas to gaya, lekin sthaneey buddha bahusankhyak samudaay ne unhen aaj tak nahin apanaaya he
 This is the reason that after the military rule in Myanmar, the social boycott of the Rohingya community was turned into a political decision and stripped of citizenship
 2012 main rakhin main kuch surakshakarmiyon kii hatya ke baad rohingya or baudhon ke bich vyapak dange bhadak gaye
 Since then violence against the Rohingya community in Myanmar has continued
 yahi vajah he ki rohingya duusare deshon main sharan le rahe hai
 Now it has to be seen whether India adopts the path of Thailand to send back the Rohingyas

 adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki yah maamla court tak bhi pahunch gaya tha, lekin in 22 restaurant ke maalikon ne paryaavaran ko lekar bane niyamon ko andekha kiya
 Due to which action was taken to seal restaurants on a large scale
 dilli polution control cameti ke aadesh ke chalate ceiling kii kaarywahi hone ke baad dilli ke anya restaurants bhi chapet main aa sakate hai

 Our industry is like this
 ham bhi virodh pradarshan kar sakate hai, lekin hamaari industry aisi hi he
 Sanjay Leela Bhansali employs hundreds of people
 ham unke saath aisa vyavhaar katai bardaasht nahin kar sakate'
 The Directors Association will use a special poster to oppose it
 isamen par likhaa he, 'main ek filmmekar hum or mujhe film banane di jaae'
 Khalji was not crazy about Padmavati, said, "I have 1600 beautiful wives
 The Association of Four Wives has appealed to Union Minister Smriti Irani and Home Minister Rajnath Singh along with four other organizations to take a stand on the release of the film
" diarectors association ke alaava tivi artist association, cinemetographers association, screen play association or art diarector va costum diziners ke sanghathan ne bhi bhansaali ke samarthan main aawaaj uthaai he
 Chairman of the Directors Association BP Singh said, Sanjay Leela Bhansali is a well-known filmmaker, he has taken the film industry to a different level
 pehle film ko relies hone den, phir darshakon ko tay karne den
 Bhansali understands that this is not a license or a miss use
 ham sab is virodh ke khilaaf hai or bhansaali ke saath khadey hai
 Haryana Minister's charge- If Bhansali's 'padmavati' glorification of Khilji is not released in these states, then it will be effective that Padmavati is being opposed in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana
 agar in chaar rajyon main ye film relies nahi hui to is film par auki iske bajet par iskaa kya asar hoga ye dekhnaa dilaschasp he
 We spoke to Komal Nahata, the trade analyst of Bollywood to know this

 The entire area of rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana and half of Mumbai circuit in Gujarat
 kul milakar film ko nuksaan hoga
 More than 18–19 percent of the film will be affected
 agsibitors ko bhi ab dar lagane laga he, kyonki agar todphod hui to unka bhi nuksaan hoga
 Let me tell you that the budget of the film Padmavati is around 180 to 190 crores and in such a situation, it is interesting to see whether this film can be released in these states after so many contracts

 Everyone knows that whether the directors are Ranjit Sinha or Anil Sinha, the difference may be just the name, there may be a difference in the year of joining the IPS, but the two could never muster the courage to go against political masters in their careers
 isliye agar aap yah soch rahe hai ki sibiai kii jaanch or kaaryastylee main koi amul-chul parivartan ho jayega, to aapako niraashaa hi haath lagane vaali he
 But the question is why Narendra Modi thought Anil Sinha better for this post
 darasal, modi sarkaar kii majaburi he ki aaj kii taarikh main vah chaahe anil ambani hon yaa kumaar mangalam birla yaa gautam adani yaa unke sabase vishwaasapaatr amit shah, sabake bhavishya sibiai jaanch kii disha par tay honge
 And Anil Sinha will do what the Modi government wants, meaning he will not do anything that will cause any trouble to the government and especially Narendra Modi
 haalanki yah bhi tay he ki vah ranjit sinha kii galati ko bhi nahin doharaaenge
 Anil Sinha's specialty is that he does not believe in keeping anyone angry and can go to any extent to please the boss
 jaankaar maanate hai ki shaayad pradhanmantri narendra modi us siddhant par chal rahe hai ki "jaani-pahachaani buraai, anjaane shaitan se behatar hoti he"

 Narendra Modi again got emotional today and he said with a veiled hug that even after his departure from here, Gujarat will move forward and if he has done anything wrong then he should be forgiven
 gujarat vidhansabha ke sadasyon ko sambodhit karte hue modi ne kaha, 'agar maine kuch galat kiya he to mujhe maaf kar dijie
 This is my fourth term as Chief Minister
 ab main ja rahaa hum or pataa nahin yahaan waapas kab aaunga, isliye main chahta hum ki agar aapako lagata he ki main apane kaam main sahi nahin tha or mere aacharan main koi kami thi to mujhe maaf kar dijie
 'the members of the Gujarat Legislative Assembly bid farewell to Modi and the future Prime Minister said with a veiled hug,' Today is a day of forgiveness
 main aap sabhi kaa or is sadan kaa sammaan karata hum
 i especially thank the opposition
 ' loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kii shandaar jeet par vipakshi congress or ensipi ke netaaon ne bhi unhen badhai di or pradhanmantri ke taur par unke kaarykaal ke liye shubhakamanaayen deen
 Modi had a different look on Tuesday when he became emotional in his address after being elected the leader of the BJP Parliamentary Party in Delhi and his eyes were moist
 bhaavnaatmak lahaze main hi modi ne aaj kaha, 'meri safalataa isamen he ki aap vikaas kii is yatra ko kis tarah aage le jate hai
 And i am confident that Gujarat will move forward after i leave
 hameshaa rakhenge gujarat kaa dhyanamodi ne vidhansabha ko bharosa dilaayaa ki pradhanmantri banane ke baad vah hameshaa gujarat kaa dhyaan karenge
 He said, 'it is natural that Gujaratis have the first right over me
 lekin is nai jimmedaari ke saath mujhe yah sunishchit karnaa hoga ki anya logon ke saath anyaay nahin ho
 i will ensure that Gujarat gets its rights as well
 ' nav niyukt pradhanmantri ne achche kaam jari rakhane ke liye sansthaaon ko majboot karne par jor diya
 The 63-year-old Modi said, 'person-based attitude does not last long
 hamen vichaaron ko sansthagat rup dena hoga jahaan log aate hai or jate hai, lekin achche kaam chalate rahete hai
 If some people study the last 12 years of Gujarat, they will find that the emphasis was on building institutions
 modi ne ginaayin uplabdhiyanmodi ke mutabik jab vah mukhyamantri banane ke liye gujarat aaye the to bukamp, tufaan ke baad tathaa madhavpura sahakaari bank jaise sahakaari bainkon main ghotaalon ke baad sthiti vikat thi
 He counted his achievements and said that these helped change the face of Gujarat
 unhone kaha, 'meraa vyaktigat rup se maananaa he ki kaig kii reporton kaa istemaal raajnneetik phaaydon ke liye nahin balki samaadhaan nikaalane ke liye hona chahie
 i made such a system here and asked my people to get to the roots of the problems
 modi ne kaha, 'meraa hameshaa se maananaa rahaa he ki loktantr main ek vidhayak bhi myne rakhata he phir vah kisi bhi party kaa pratinidhitiv karata ho
 The voice of the legislator means the voice of the public
 na keval bijepi ke vidhayakon ne balki yahaan maujuud sabhi logon ne is rajya kii samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye kadi mehnat kii he
 Now in the PMO, Gujarati said lightly that now Gujarati will be spoken in the Prime Minister's Office
 unhone kaha, jab koi jaataa he to apane saath kai chijen le jaataa he
 Now Gujarati will be spoken in PMO
 aapako khaman-dhokala bhi milegaa
 Modi once again became emotional on the suggestion of Leader of the Opposition Shankar Singh Vaghela to make special arrangements for Gujaratis in the PMO
 modi ne apane dil kii taraf ishaara karte hue kaha, dilli main alag counter kholane kii koi jarurat nahin he
 i have already opened a permanent counter here
 dilli main pradooshan kaa str ek baar phir teji se bad gaya he
 Dust sheets are seen everywhere in the sky
 is dhul bhari pradooshit hawa main saans lene ke kaaran logon ke swasthy par bura asar pad rahaa he
 Pollution causes health problems: Breathing in polluted air can cause cough, cold, eye irritation, lung infection, respiratory disease, skin problems, heart disease, hair loss etc
 dama ke rogiyon ko atake padane kii sambhaavna bhi bahut zyada hoti he
 Delhi's air has become dangerous, include these things in food
 Avoid such things from polluted air: 1
 akyuai index 150 se zyada hone par zyada physical activity vaali eksrasij, cricket, hockey, cycling, marathon se parhez karen
 Do not run and walk in the park even if the pollution level is more than 200
 jab pradooshan str 300 se zyada ho to lambii duuri kii walk naa karen
 When the level is above 400, stay indoors, do not even walk normally
 ghar ke bheetar rahen
 When the pollution level is at 1000, there are situations like public health emergency
 is str par bilkul bhi ghar se baahar naa nikalen, ghar par hi rahen
 2
 ghar se baahar nikalne se pehle chehre par mask jarur lagaaein
 3
 apane ghar or aas-paas kii jagahon par zyada se zyada ped lagaaein
 They purify the air
 jisase aap taaji hawa main saans le paaenge
 4
 saanson se sharir main pahunche jehar ko baahar nikaalane ke liye pani bahut jaruri he
 So do not forget to drink water
 din main takreeban 4 litre tak pani pien
 Drink water while leaving the house
 isse sharir main oxigen kii supplai sahi bani rahegi or vaataavaran main maujuud jahrili gaisen agar blad tak pahunch bhi jaaengi to kam nuksaan pahunchaayengi
 5
 khaane main jitna ho sake vitamin-si, omega-3 ko prayog main laaen
 Use honey, garlic and ginger as much as possible
 khaansee, zukam kii sthiti main shahad or adarak ke ras kaa seven karen
 Excessive sleep is the enemy of the heart, heart attack can come 6
 agar ghar se baahar nikalnaa aapaki majaburi he to ghar aane ke baad gunagune pani se munh, ankhen or naak saaf karen
 You can also take steam after coming from outside
 7
 Do not allow children to play outside as long as there is pollution
 cycling karne se bachein, zyada der paidal naa chalem
 8
 kaph kii dikkat he to shahad main kaali mirch milakar len
 At the same time, garlic contains antibiotic elements which increase the ability to fight pollution
 9
 Always keep medicines together if you are an asthma patient
 garbhvatee mahilaayein ghar main rahane ke dauraan bhi mask pahanen
 10
 subah ke vakt pradooshan kaa str zyada hota he isliye morning walk par nahin jaaen
 Get out only after sunshine
 motorcical yaa cycle se baahar nahin nikalen

 Blood plasma is formed back in 2 to 3 days
 laal rakt koshikaon ke banane main lagbhag 20 se 59 din tak lagate hai or yah nirbhar karata he ki vyakti kitne antaraal par raktadan karata rahata he
 How important blood donation is, you can only guess that in cases of sudden excessive bleeding or other diseases, such as low or no blood formation, the patient is given blood from outside
 yah khun ek vyakti se lekar duusare vyakti ko abo evam aar ech blad group maiching karne ke baad chadhaaya jaataa he

 If you too are the mother of a teenager, now you need to be more alert than before
 ladakon se dosti, unke prati aakarshan, snapchet, vilog, kool kapade or kai duusari chijen ab aapaki beti kii aadat ban chuki hongi

 Many times, they also feel bad about parental restraint and after that they start hiding the same things
 aise main maa-baap ko samajhadaari se kaam lene kii jarurat he:1
 It takes time to adapt according to the changes
 Your daughter, who is growing up, will also be feeling many changes inside herself
 aise main use har baar un baton ko lekar tokna sahi nahin he
 Giving him full time to understand himself is the right option
 jab wo apane bheetar or apane aas-paas ke badlaav ko khud se samajhegi to behatar tareeke se nirnay le paaegi
 It would not be right to impose your thoughts and thinking on it
 2
 Do not compare it to others, often parents do this
 paas-pados ke bacchon se yaa phir rishtedaaron ke bacchon se apni beti kii tulana karnaa aapke liye hi khataranakaho saktaa he
 Children often take these things as insults and then their own parents start seeing them as enemies
 3
 He also needs space
 Every human needs his space, your daughter too
 aise main har vakt uske peeche jasoos kii tarah ghoomana yaa phir har baat par poochtacha karnaa sahi nahin hoga
 Give him his space
 aisa karne se aap donon ke bich kaa bharosa badhegaa

 The Congress has opened a front against the Modi government at the Center regarding the Rafale plane deal
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi dwaara pradhanmantri narendra modi par hamalavar rukh apnaane ke baad party ke varisht netaa mukhar hokar rafel ke sahare bhartiya janata party par hallaa bol rahe hai

 He said that the Congress had talked about the deal of 126 Rafale aircraft, but the Modi government reduced the number to 36
 aaazaad ne kaha, 'upie sarkaar main 126 rafel jet vimaanon ke liye nividaayen di gai thim, lekin yah sauda radd kar diya gaya
 What are we buying now? 36 only

 raashtrapati emanuel macrorafelsaude ko kitna bhi behatar bataa len, lekin desh main vipaksh or khaas taur par congress is mudde ko lekar modi sarkaar ko gher kar rakhana chaahati he
 This is the reason why in recent times, Congress Party President Rahul Gandhi had described Rafael Deal as Modi's 'personal Deal'
 congress ne patr jari kar kaha tha ki modi ji persenalee paris gaye, khud rafel deal kii or persenalee deal badali
 Not only this, the Congress had released a list of 10 questions on Rafael to PM Modi and said that the Congress will go public throughout the country and spread the Rafale Deal
 
 
 1
 Is it confidential that the Defense Minister is hiding the Rafale deal? 2
 kya sansad desh kii suraksha ke liye khatra he? CCS se kya anumati lee gai is saude ke liye?3
 It is alleged that the cost of a plane is Rs

 4
 america ke sabase aadhunik yuddh vimaan kii keemat bhi 1500 karod rupee nahin he to phir ye vimaan itane mahange kyon kharide gaye?5

 In the wake of the Lok Sabha elections, since the alliance between Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party and Mayawati's BSP in Uttar Pradesh, Shivpal Yadav's attitude has become even tighter
 pragatisheel samaajawaadee party (lohia) ke pramukh shivpal yadav ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki bahujan samaaj party kii mukhiya mayawati ne kabhi samaajwaadiyon kaa sammaan nahin kiya or un par atyaachaar kiye
 He also said that the SP-BSP alliance is a mismatch alliance
 mangalvaar ko unhone kaha ki sapa-basapa gathbandhan bemail he
 The BSP chief never respected the socialists and even persecuted them
 gathbandhan karne kaa faisla nijee hiton kaa faisla he or is faisle ko log sweekaar nahin karenge
 He also said that those who are boasting on this alliance will soon see their dreams shattering
 haalanki, is dauraan unhene kisi kaa naam nahin liya

 The SP-BSP alliance is a decision taken in self-interest, the result of which will be seen in the election result
 '' unhone kaha ki yah sapa-basapa gathbandhan par jinhen ahankaar he vah jald hi chakanachur ho jaayegaa
 Taking a dig at the Bharatiya Janata Party, Yadav said that the people have rejected these people, the Iqbal of the BJP government and Modi is dead
 unhone kaha ki bhaaiyon-bahanon bolne vaale narendra modi ko koi nahin sunanaa chahta, desh visham paristhitiyon se guzar rahaa he
 In today's time, farmers, laborers, minorities, youth, women, businessmen are all unhappy but political parties are doing politics of bungalows instead of taking to the streets
 shivpal yadav ne kaha ki ham samaajawaadee log hai, hamane andolan kar hameshaa khud ko sabit kiya he
 On the strength of the struggle, we have changed governments and also come to power

 a Congress leader who was an ally of Vishwanath Pratap Singh said that when the law was passed, the then Chief Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh argued in the Assembly that the state government should bear the burden of income tax as most of the ministers are from poor backgrounds and their income is low

 bas ek chingaari bhar kii der he or chhid jaaegi america or uttar korea main jang
 Scaring is not our objective at all
 magar ab halaat hi aise ban gaye hai kyonki abhi tak to bas north korea kaa sanakee taanashaah ye dhamkee de rahaa tha lekin ab pehali baar behad khule lafzon main america raashtrapati donald trump ne kah diya he ki duniya ke liye cancer ban chuke kim jong un kaa ilaaj zaruri he
 Now even Trump knows what he is saying
 isliye unhone isdhamkike saath ye bhi saaf kar diya he ki ye sangharsh bahut bheeshan hoga
 The US will not spare North Korea, after trying to avoid war in these same words and losing millions of efforts to pressure Kim Jong on them, US President Donald Trump has made the whole world aware of the current situation
 trump ke in lafzon ke myanon ko samajhnaa bahut zaruri he
 Because when these world's most powerful countries started speaking
 to maan lijie ki halaat vaaki ab kaabo main nahin hai
 So first of all, know that Trump's threat is clear that now he is not in any mood to spare any action of North Korea
 yuddh tal saktaa he agar kim chahelmerica ke raashtrapati donald trump ne kaha ki north korea ke saath bheeshan jang kabhi bhi ho sakati he
 And this is the only chance that we can end a big catastrophe
 haa magar kim jong un agar apane parmaanu kaaryakramon ko rokane ko taiyaar ho jaaen to ham yuddh ko taal sakate hai
 What Kim wants at this age after taking command of North Korea is not easy
 duniya ko dhamka rahaa he taanashaah unjab se donald trump raashtrapati bane hai
 The US has been dealing with North Korea strictly since then
 haal hi main kim jong un kii nitiyon se nipatane ke liye america up-raashtrapati mike pence ne kaha tha ki sabar kaa baandh ab tut chukaa he
 And now US President Donald Trump himself has given North Korea the covenant in clear words
 uttar korea ko rokane ke liye america kootnithik taur par use gherne kii kaaphi koshish kar chukaa he
 But Kim Jong-un could not reduce his guror by an inch
 ulataa uskaa gussa is kadar bhadh gaya he ki ab wo seenaa taan kar duniya ko dhamka rahaa he
 If we are provoked by the atomic bomb threat, we will not only attack nuclear enemies
 balki har hafte parmaanu pareekshan bhi karenge
 And nothing can stop us
 dushman kii sabhi gatividhiyon par najar rakhi ja rahi he or kisi bhi tarah kii aakraamakata kaa jawaab dene ke liye bhi ham taiyaar hai
 No one can touch North Korea, and if that happens, our people will not only protect themselves from guns and missiles
 balki hamaare paas parmaanu bam hai, unke sirf teen bamon se duniya khatm ho jaaegi
 Is the war really set for America threatening a tough answer? ek pal ko is daraane vaale sach ko nazarandaz kar bhi dete
 But how to ignore him, who is sitting with five atomic bombs and is not ready to come under control
 trump ke munh se kuch bhi nikalne se pehle uski jubaan ye bolne ko taiyaar baithi rahati he ki america kii har harakat kaa jawaab milegaa
 There will be a befitting reply
 magar jo kim jong un karnaa chahta he
 Humanity will not be able to tolerate it
 dakshin korea main thad kii tainatimgar ye bhi hakeekat he ki aankh band kar lene sachai badalati nahin
 And the truth is that while the US has deployed its warships in Korean Peninsula, on the other hand it has the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense in South Korea which is known by the world as Thad
 uski tainaati bhi shuru kar di he
 If you understand the head deployed in the current war situation from North Korea, it is used to disarm the missiles
 donon taraf se jang kii taiyaaridonon desh apane bayanon main jis tarah kii aag ugal rahe hai
 Guess from him that if this struggle really happened then it would be so horrific
 kyonki jab jab america ek kadam aage badhaata he tab tab ye taanashaah jang kii jaanib 10 kadam or aage batch jaataa he
 The US laid siege to North Korea by deploying anti-ballistic missile systems, nuclear submarines, ship fleet Carl Vinson and Thad
 to uttar korea ne bhi apni sabase badi military drill main 300 bade texon se bambaari kii or nakli warship par sabamarine se hamalaa kar ke or dhamaake se udaakar america ko ye sandesh bhi de diya he ki har hamale kaa jawaab uske paas bhi he

 His inclination towards you can also give you a hint
 agar ladkaa aapako pasand karata he, to baat karte-karte yaa majaak karte-karte wo aapaki taraf jhukegaa yaa aapke kandhe par sar rakhega
 Another very fine hint is that the boy who is showing interest in you will always listen carefully to you
 koi bhi baat discus karte vakt wo gambhirtha se aapako sunegaa or apni raay bhi degaa
 Every girl is hungry for supplements
 agar is baat ko wo ladkaa samajhataa he, to wo aapako jarur achche-achche compcement degaa
 Whatever someone else says about you, but that boy will always praise you
 uskaa sharmila hona bhi ek badhiya hint he
 Girls are usually more shy
 lekin apni pasand kii ladki ke kareeb aate hi kuch ladke gulabi ho jate hai
 If he is shy, then understand that you have captured his heart
 advance hoti technology ke is yug main kaai bhi apane phone ko khud se dur nahin karata
 But if that guy turns away the phone while you're with you, or gives you more attention than the messages and calls coming in the phone, then understand that the bells are ringing there too

 Chandraswamy met him when Narasimha Rao was the President of Andhra Pradesh Congress
 do-chaar mulakaaton ke baad usne raav ko prabhavit kar diya tha
 Perhaps this was the reason why he was made the General Secretary of Hyderabad Youth Congress
 -chandraswami kaa asli naam nemi chandra jain tha, baba banane ke baad usne apana naam badal liya tha
 After this, Chandraswami came to Delhi and found a place in the servants' quarters outside the bungalow of Mahesh Joshi, the then General Secretary of the Youth Congress and the elder leader of Madhya Pradesh Congress

 a few days later, he made his mark as Guru Chandraswami
 aage chalakar netaa, abhinayta, puunjipati sabhi uske jaal main funsate chale gaye
 It is said about Chandraswami that it spread the illusion of drinking milk to the idol of Ganesha across the country
 -chandraswami par rajeev gandhi hatyakand ke abhiyukton kii madad karne kaa aarope bhi shaamil he
 - Time overturned and despite all the high contacts he had to go to jail
 daaud ibrahim giroh se jude anderworld ke sadsy bablu shrivastav kaa pratyrpan karke 1995 main nepal se bharat laayaa gaya tha
 During the cbi's interrogation, he gave information that Chandraswami had a relationship with Dawood Ibrahim
 ye jaankaree saamne aane ke turant baad tatkaaleen kendriya grih rajyamantri rajesh payalat ne sibiai se karrwai karne ko kaha
 After this, many cases, including foreign currency law violations, began to be investigated against Chandraswami
 - purv videsh mantri natwar singh ne ek intervyuu main bataaya tha ki purv pradhanmantri margaret thatcher tantric chandraswami se bhi mili thim
 He also claimed that Thatcher's prediction of becoming Prime Minister was made long before him
 is baat kaa zikr natwar ne apni kitaab, 'walking vid loyns- tels from a diplomatic past' main bhi kiya he

 According to sources, when Aamir believes that when the audience will watch the trailer of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil and Dangal with Shivaay, then their focus will be more on the film than the trailer, that means the audience's attention will be shifted towards the trailer and the film which Aamir does not accept
 isliye aamir ne apane niyam ko darkinar kar is saal diwali se ek haftaa pehle hi trailor release karne kii yojana banaai hai
 It is also being told that Aamir had last week organized a show with his special friends to get opinions about Dangal and it was only after the show that Aamir took this decision

 Ajinkya Rahane made a good catch and Brad Hodge scored the match by running out but we also missed two catches
 ’unhone kaha, ‘iske alaava ham aakhri do overon main acchhee ballebaaji nahin kar paye the
 We should have made a big score

 While fielding, Dravid had a hamstring injury due to which he did not field further
 unhone kaha, ‘yah niraashajanak he ki main khilaadiyon ke saath maidan par nahin rahaa lekin mujhe khushi he ki aakhir main ham jeet darj karne main safal rahe
 It is only cramps that will soon heal

 During the entire day, the train is able to run for only 70 to 100 kilometers, passing through traffic jams and no driver is allowed to drive more than 25 days
 is tarah ve maheene main sirf 7 se 12 hajaar ke bich hi kama pate hai
 In order to earn more money, these drivers drive fast on the roads and this is why DTC buses are often the most accident on the roads of Delhi NCR
 2015 main iartiaiki ek report ke mutbik dilli main sabase zyada accident ditisi ke kaaran hote hai

 saath hi durghatnaon par bhi lagaam lagaaya ja sake
 At present, about 12 thousand drivers are working with DTC temporarily
 ve 7 se 15 saal se ditisi se jude hue hai
 While the number of permanent drivers is only around 4 thousand
 gauratlab he ki ditisi par driveron kii bhartee ko lekar isse pehle bhi kai sawaal khadey ho chuke hai
 In fact, around three thousand unfit drivers were recruited in DTC
 aaj haal yah he ki driveron ko rang pahchaanane main kaaphi dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 The High Court is also hearing in this matter
 philhal court is maamle main 28 agast ko sunwaayee karegaa
 In such a situation, it will be seen whether the contract workers of DTC get relief from the court or not

 Skill development centers opened to remove unemployment are constantly pleading with the government for work
 lekin sivaae aashwaasan ke kuch nahin mil rahaa
 Ministry of Skill and Entrepreneurship from NSDC and Ministry from NSDC
 yahaan se vahaan chakkar lagaalagakar log halkaan hai
 But these centers are not getting work
 piemkevivai ke tahat centre chalaane vaale sirsa ke rakesh kulharia kehete hai, hamen samaj nahin aata ki jab hamaare centre acridiated hai
 They have got 4 stars or 5 stars
 phir hamen kaam kyon nahin diya ja rahaa
 We spent 15-20 lakhs
 lagaakar centre khole
 Staff put their salary in them from our pockets
 lekin kabhi bairiphication ke naam par to kabhi centre apruval kii taarikh ko dhaal banaakar hamen kaam nahin diya ja rahaa
 We challenge that the quality of the Prime Minister's Skill Development Center and our centers be compared
 agar ham guideline ko puraa na karen to phir hamen radd kar diya jaae
 Rinku from Hisar says such a big scheme was launched in the name of employment
 par kya andaja he ki ek centre ke khulne par kitne logon ko rojgaar miltaa he or bin kaaran bataae use kaam na dene par kitne log berozegaar ho jate hai?ve kehete hai, ‘main eemaandaaree se kahuun jab hamen kaam nahin mila to hamane chaar-paanch maheene tak do trainer, ek security, guard, resepshanist, safai karmi ko vetan diya lekin phir unhen hataa diya kyonki hamen koi kaam hi nahin mila
 After three months we got assurance, then we called them again
 lekin ab phir hamen kaam nahin mil rahaa
 Vikram Sinha, who comes from Jaipur, says, 'I was allotted only 60 seats in a year
 jabaki mere centre kii kshamta thi 920 students
 Now you tell me, we are ruined, are we not? ’hisar ke sanjeev sahaaran ne bataaya 16 may ko ministry of skill deveopment ne enesdisi ko yah guideline jari kar di ki guideline main jo centres feet baithen unhen kaam diya jaae
 This guideline said that those who have achieved the target of giving employment to 70 percent people should be given work
 yahaan par bairiphication physical hona tha
 NSDC then put a hurdle in this and broke the guidelines and said that three months salary slips should be required for job verification
 yani iskaa sidhaa matlab he ki ve hi student job main maane jaaenge jo teen maah tak job kar chuke hon
 In such a situation, the center will not get any work for three months! The second hurdle is that after 20 June 2017, the approvals will not be given work
 mudra yojana ke tahat lone lene ke liye nahin yogya piemkevivai certificatedhari!rakesh, shitu, sanjeev kehete hai 'ab jaraa is yojana kaa ek paksh students kii taraf se bhi rakhen
 Suppose you have become proficient under this scheme
 certificate lekar bank main jaaiye or mudra lone ke tahat lone applai kiijie
 The bank manager is not ready to lend on this certificate
 hamane or duusare centre chalaane vaale kai logon ne mudra yojana ke tahat lone ke liye students se applai karavaaya
 But not a single person got a loan
 ' rakesh kehete hai jab berozegaron ko lone dene vaali desh kii sabase badi yojana hi is certificate par lone nahin degi to phir aakhir pradhanmantri kaushal vikaas yojana ke certificate ko duusare sarkari or gaiyr sarkari mahakamon main manyata kaise milegi
 Overall, the scheme has several weak links
 or yah sari kadiyaan ek duusare se judi hui hai
 The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship was formed in the year 2014
 2 oktober 2016 main pradhanmantri kaushal vikaas yojana karodon ru
 Was started with a budget of Rs
 makasad berozegaron ko hunarmand bananaa or hunarmandon ko certificate dekar unhen rikgnise karnaa
 Modi ji, we have also put your photos according to the guideline, yet the government is upset? If you read the PMKY guidelines, then your attention will definitely go towards branding
 isamen centre ke har kone or kamare main yojana kaa prachaar karte hording or binar lagaae jane ke naa keval saaf-saaf nirdesh die gaye hai balki kya sies or kaisaa material hoga yah bhi bataaya gaya he
 Nishant, who came from Kaithal, said, December 2016, my center was rejected
 vajah keval itani thi ki maine baahar guideline ke hisaab se 20pichley saal disambar se kai baar andolan kar chuke piemkevai centres maalikon ne ek baar phir 30 may ko kaushal evam udhyamita mantralay ke khilaaf protest kiya

 isi kadi main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne somvaar ko ballabhagarh main chunavi jansabha ko sambodhit kiya
 During this time, PM Modi said that when i come among you in Haryana, i feel that i have come to my house
 haryana kaa vikaas or yahaan ke logon ke jivan main badlaav hameshaa meri praathamikta rahi he
 He said, Today, the whole world and big leaders of the world are desperate to stand with India and join it

 He said, how much opposition parties had created about the Rafale fighter aircraft
 in logon ne puraa jor lagaaya ki rafel sauda radd ho jaae or bharat main nayaa ladaaku vimaan na aa paae
 But despite all their efforts, the first fighter aircraft has been handed over to India

 kargil kii jang ko bhale hi 18 saal ho gaye hon, lekin aaj us jang ke do vir yoddha soobedaar sanjay kumaar or soobedaar major yogendra yadav kashmir ke maujuuda halaat main ek baar phir ladane ke liye taiyaar hai
 Subedar Sanjay Kumar says that Kargil war was an important part of my life
 maine apane jivan kaa bada hissaa kashmir main guzaara or uske baad mujhe kargil jang main jane kaa mauka mila
 Sanjay said, our military training is such that we do not face any problem in any operation
 hamaare senior har kadam par hamen sahi raay dete the
 The seniors had the experience and we had the passion
 hamen mashkoh ghati main ek post ko capchar karne kaa aadesh mila tha
 We were greatly damaged by the two guns on that post
 mujhe jab bhi kashmir dobaaraa jane kaa mauka milegaa main apni unit ke saath vahaan jaaoongaa
 In the past also we faced terrorists in Kashmir
 ladaai ke mukaable main kashmir main jo aatankwaad virdohi oparation chal rahe hai ve zyada mushkil hai
 Because it does not know where the enemy is hiding and when to fire
 vahiin, soobedaar major yogendra yadav ke mutabik, kargil kii ladaai ek vishesh ladaai thi, kyonki ham pehle se taiyaar nahin the
 Suddenly we get orders that we have to attack
 main to us vakt shaadi karke lautaa tha
 i was 19 years old
 tiger hills ko capchar karne ke liye ek ghaatak platoon banaai gai thi or meraa saubhaahgya he ki mujhe us platoon main jane kaa mauka mila
 On the third night, we were contacted by our enemies and we continued on regardless of death
 ek ke baad ek mere saathi sainik shahid hote rahe
 We finally captured Tiger Hill
 har sainik ke andar jajba hota he ki jab bhi use dushmano kaa naash karne kaa mauka mili vahasarhadaper jayega
 i am also always ready to go to the front for my country even today
 jab tak kashmir main puri tarah se dehshatgardi khatm nahin hoti ham ek bhi aatanki ko nahin chodenge
 Subedar Major Yogendra Yadav is also regretful that a soldier does not get the highest level of respect from the society
 sena jarur apane sainik kaa puraa khyaal rakhti he or sammaan detii he
 Mahadev is always guiding his devotees
 unako sahi raah dikhaanaa or aadhyatmik jivan kii taraf chalane ke liye prerit karnaa ve kabhi nahi bhoolatey
 If the devotees always follow the path of Lord Shiva, they will never be disappointed and will always be happy and efficient
 to chaliye aaj jaanate hai shiv kii raah par chalakar kis prakaar se safalataa arjeet kii ja sakati he-pracheen kaal main ek ghatana kaa varnan kaaphi baar kiya gaya he jisamen bhagwaan shiv mata parvati ko bataa rahen he ki kis prakaar se safalataa mil sakati he
 Once Goddess Parvati asked Bhole Nath how success can be achieved in spiritual life
 tab bhagwaan shiv ne 6 sutara bataae the safalataa paane ke-1
 faith-lord Shiva says, it is very important to have faith in yourself
 ham kisi manzil ko aasaani se hasil kar sakate hai agar ham khud par vishwaas rakhenge
 At the same time, if we will be frustrated and find ourselves less than others, then it will be difficult to achieve the goal
 2
 Shraddha - You should always have reverence for your God, for your work
 dhairya safalataa kii puunji hoti he
 If we keep faith and saburi, then every floor of ours will become easy
 vahiin agar ham apane man ko hameshaa shankaaon se gherkar rakhenge, to kisi bhi kaam ko purna shraddha ke saath nahin kar sakate
 3
 sachcha guru- har kisi ke jivan main ek sachche guru kaa hona bahut aavashyak hota he
 If there is no Guru, then we will become directionless
 guru kaa hameshaa aadar karnaa jaruri he kyonki wo hamaare ko sahi raah dikhaate hai, ishwar ke darshan karavaate hai or hamaare ko lakshya prapti main madd karte hai
 4
 samta bhav- safalataa arjeet karne ke liye insaan ko samta bhav rakhana chahie
 a person should never consider himself superior nor should he consider himself less than anyone
 donon hi sthiti main insaan kaa patan hota he or wo safalataa kii seedhi se neeche gir jaataa he
 5
 indriya nigrah- ham apni vibhinn indriyon ke chalate hameshaa bahut chanchal rahete hai
 Our mind becomes very distracted and concentration does not remain
 lekin hindu dharm main is baat ko spasht rup se bataaya gaya he ki upasna karte samay apni indriyon par kaabo rakhana aavashyak he
 Similarly, if you want success, then you should learn to keep your mind stable
 6
 Satvik food - It is said that the way you consume food, your behavior becomes the same
 isliye bholenath kehete hanki agar safalataa chahie to hameshaa satvik bhojan hi grahan karen
 Eating tamasic food can harm our body but our ability to work together is also affected

 pakistani sena ke poonch sector main niyantran rekha kaa ulanghan kar paanch bhartiya javaanon ko maarane ke baad vipaksh ke hamale se congress baukhala gai he
 When Congress MP and head of SCST commission, PL Punia was asked about the attack, he remembered the British
 puniya bole ki congress ne angrejon ke khilaaf aazaadee kii ladaai ladi he
 Can not question our patriotism
 iske baad puniya bole ki aresas vaale angrejon ke pitthu or gaddaar the
 PL Punia talking to the reporter till today Punia's tongue slipped on Emergency After this, he said something, due to which he probably had to clear the party high command too
 bijepi or aresas ko koste koste puniya bole ki bijepi waalon se pucho ki ve immergency ke dauraan yaa usase pehle kahaan the
 Punia forgot that the BJP was formed in 1980 and before that BJP leaders ran a party called Jana Sangh, which was blessed with the Sangh
 puniya bhul gaye ki immergency ke dauraan vaajapeyi or adwani samet kai jansanghee netaa or sangh kaaryakarta jail main band the
 Punia also forgot that the emergency he is referring to, is considered by the opposition and the Congress to be the era of Congress dictatorship
 congress bhi us dinon kii jyadatiyon ke liye jab tab afsos jaahir karti he
 Why do we not make a noise in the Parliament? is sawaal par puniya kaa jawaab tha ki ham nahin tidipi ke log the
 There were people from Bodoland who were making noise
 phir jawaab kuch durust karte hue puniya bole ki jab tidipi ke log bolte hai to vahaan se aae congressi saansadon ko bhi bolnaa padataa he
 In the last, the leader said that strict action should be taken against Pakistan
 videsh rajya mantri emje akbar par kathith rup se lage aaropon ko lekar media main khaskar hindi ke akhabaaron main kisi reporting ho rahi he, yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga
 Nowhere are the details of the women who made allegations anywhere
 jahaan pramukhataa se chhapi hai vahaan bhi or kai jagah to khabar aise chhapi he jaise yun hi kisi ne raah chalate aarope laga di ho
 You will be surprised that in some Hindi newspapers, the news of ten to twenty lines is not printed properly
 videsh rajya mantri par 9 mahila patrakaron ne aarope lagaae hon, puri sarkaar chup ho gai ho or hindi akhabaaron se is khabar ko kareeb kareeb gaayab kar diya jaae yah kitna dukhad he
 There are many editions of a newspaper
 hard kapi hoti he, i sanskaran hote hai, website hoti he
 Anurag Dwari from Bhopal told that there is no news of Akbar in the hard copy of two big Hindi newspapers on October 10
 inke lakhon pathakon ko pataa hi nahin chalaa hoga, jabaki yah khabar patrika or bhaskar main he
 Bhaskar also featured on the front page on 9 October
 bihar kii rajdhani patna se manish kumaar ne bataaya ki sirf prabhaat khabar main he
 There are no three major Hindi newspapers
 sochie karodon pathakon tak yah khabar nahin pahunchane di gai
 On October 9, there was no news in three Dehradun newspapers
 10 aktubar ko bhi ek bade akhbaar main yah khabar gaayab thi magar do akhabaaron main bheetar ke panne main maamuli tareeke se chhapi he
 After that we checked the e-editions of six Hindi newspapers
 sirf teen main ye khabar he
 This is not news on the front page of three
 i-sanskaran ke maamle main hamane sirf pehle panne ko check kiya he
 So is this news reaching the readers of Hindi newspaper equally? i have no opinion on why newspapers have not published the news of MJ Akbar
 sabhi yaa kah sakate hai ki zyadatar akhbaaron main alok nath par lage aarope kii khabar he
 That is, the news of the Meitu movement is being published, but the news of MJ Akbar is nowhere
 kya ye sirf angrezi media ke liye pramukh khabar he
 On October 10, the Indian Express reported the allegations on Akbar on the front page
 heading he ki chah mahilaon ne awaz uthaai, mantri akbar par sexual harasment ke aarope lagaae jab ve sampadak the
 Even today, many big English newspapers either do not have news or have some edge
 9 aktubar ke telegraph ne ise pehali khabar ke rup main chapa tha
 By the way, if you look according to the website, this is news in almost English digital media
 news channelon kaa hamane nahin dekha
 This is because the media has expanded, but is the news reaching the readers equally from all those platforms, is silence in a large part just a matter of editorial judgment? Imagine if a Hindi newspaper reaching 6 to 8 crore readers would not be able to print this news, nor would its readers know
 isliye pathak or darshak ko bhi badalanaa hoga
 He should check the information of any important event or news through several means
 loktantr main voter hona yaa pathak hona ai iti kii pravesh pariksha kii taiyaari se bhi mushkil kaam he
 Today another article has come in the context of Akbar
 gazala wahaab naam kii mahila patrkaar ne di vir main akbar ke saath hui apni aapbeetee bayaan kii he
 Ghazala Wahab is the executive editor of FORCE newsmagazine
 gazala wahaab ne likhaa he asian age ke aakhri chah maheene main halaat narak se badtar ho gaye the
 Ghazala has written that it was not easy to write the story of the Asian Age
 maine kaaphi sochaa ki bees saal baad ye bataanaa kya uchit rahegaa, lekin logon ke messej aate rahe ki tum kab likhogi
 She was in school when the father brought books written by Akbar
 unhen padhakar patrkaar banane kaa faisla kiya
 Joined The Asian Age in 1994
 maine logon ko yah kehete suna ki yah offis akbar kaa haram he
 The girls were very much there
 ladke kam the
 i used to listen to such gossip about who is related to whom
 har riginal offis main unke garlfrand hai
 In the third year, Asian Age office culture hurt me
 meri mez akbar ke offis ke baahar laga di gai
 He kept staring at me and sending obscene messages on the office network
 phir mujhe baatcheet ke bahaane cabin main bulaane lage
 Most of the conversations were private
 ek baar kamare main dictionari dekhne ke bahaane bula liya
 i was bent to lift the dictionary that Akbar grabbed me from behind
 mere hothon par ungliyaan pherane lage
 Turned my hand over my breasts
 maine khud ko chhudaane kii koshish kii magar usne kas ke jakad liya tha
 i somehow escaped and escaped from the cabin
 toilet main jaakar rone lagi
 i told myself not to let it happen again
 main uski garlfrand nahin bananaa chaahati thi
 But i did not know that the tortures were about to begin
 agle din phir bulaayaa or kis karne kaa prayaas kiya
 i kept myself free, but there was no place
 phir usne mujhe chhod diya
 i ran
 daftar se baahar bhaagi
 Surya Kiran ran outside the building
 ek sunsaan jagah par jaakar rone lagi
 Whatever happened to Ghazala Wahab, much of what he has written, was left in translation
 maine chhod diya kyonki mujhase nahin likhaa gaya
 The anonymous woman who wrote a memoir about MJ Akbar on the First Post website is equally frightening
 aap pard nahin sakate
 i do not know what is creating a stir within the Modi government after reading all these articles, why the BJP spokesperson became so calm
 akbar ko bachaane ke liye sari sarkaar lagi hui he yaa sarkaar ne akbar se kinaaraa kar liya he
 Prime Minister Modi has not spoken yet
 yah khabar ab manage karne ke daayre se baahar ja chuki he
 Therefore, it is the test of Iqbal of this government and also of Akbar
 jahaan mahaz aarope lagane par kai patrakaron ne istife de diya lekin jis sampadak par itane gambhir aarope lage hai, kya koi ection nahin hoga, jaanch kii ghoshnaa tak nahin hui he
 It is possible that if the government is taking time to take a decision, then it has every right
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki nae videsh rajya mantri kii talash ho rahi ho jinaki angrezi akbar se acchhee ho to isamen bhi koi buraai nahin he
 But according to the government, what is right and what is not right, it will be known only when the answer is found
 gazala wahaab apane parivaar kii pehali ladki thim, shahar or ghar se baahar aakar naukari karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 Ghazala is the seventh woman journalist to have written her memoirs about MJ Akbar in public
 kul 9 mahila patrakaron ne emje akbar ko lekar aapbeetee bataai he
 Someone has written an article
 kisi ne bayaan diya he
 Someone tweeted
 sutapa paul, newcrop kii sansthaapak sampadak hai, unhone bhi aapbeetee likhi he
 Sutpa Paul has tweeted 32 on the evening of 10 October and described how Akbar made efforts to build a relationship while working at the Kolkata bureau of India Today
 yah sari baaten 2010-11 kii hai
 You heard a small part of Ghazala Wahab's tragedy
 priya ramani ne to 1997 main hi likhaa tha magar naam nahin liya, lekin is baar naam le liya
 Prerna Singh Bindra has written her objection in The Wire
 suma rahaa ne bhi aapbeetee bataai ki kaise hotel ke kamare main intervyuu ke dauraan ve asahaj ho gayi or naukari kaa prastaav sweekaar nahin kiya
 Kanika Gehlot has told the Indian Express that she too was called to the hotel but she did not go, but since then Akbar has done nothing
 ek anaam mahila patrkaar ne first post main likhaa he
 That description is also shining
 prem panikar ne bhi apni aapbeetee likhi he
 Suparna Sharma, who is currently the Resident Editor of The Asian Age, told The Indian Express that Akbar made a vulgar gesture to her
 em je akbar par 9 mahila patrakaron ne gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 Can the Government of India put such a person in the Cabinet even for a moment
 yah sarkaar bataa sakati he
 The statement of 9 women journalists is in front
 unki aapbeetee saamne he
 These are all in the shape of accusations
 kathith rup se
 Is it not easy to write what Ghazala Wahab has written even after fifty years? iskaa kanoonee mahatv kya he, is par bahes ho sakati he, lekin saat mahila patrakaron kaa baahar aakar bolnaa, saare prasang or sandarbh ke saath likhnaa kya unke liye aasaan rahaa hoga
 Therefore, the allegations made on MJ Akbar need to be answered
 modi sarkaar kya faisla karegi wo jane, bahut se log in 9 mahila patrakaron ke bare main kai sawaalon ke saath sochenge, magar priya ramani kii bhatiji ne apni chachee ko likhaa he
 To the aunt
 antee priya mujhe aap par garv he ki aapane ye sab likhaa
 You are giving a very important message to the world
 mere skool main ham ladikayaan bees minute ke liye adwiseri class main in sab muddon par baat karte hai
 We discussed Kavanog and Vensteen
 ham apane class main aap jo kar rahi hai, us par bhi charchaa karenge
 i will show you how all the women of the world need to raise their voices together
 iti cell is maamle ke aane ke baad media trial ke matlab ko samaj gaya he
 Otherwise, instead of MJ Akbar, you would have seen the same allegations in IT cell and TV channels
 phir bhi main nahin chahta ki kisi kaa media trial ho
 Many women journalists who support Me Two are constantly highlighting the difference between Twitter and Facebook as to which allegations would be considered as serious and which would not be considered as metu
 emje akbar ke bare main mahila patrakaron ne jo prasang sunaaen hai, sabamein akbar hamalavar hai
 They do not wait for consent, do not make relations, but are broken
 bees saal pehle vishakha cameti nahin thi
 Twenty years ago, women did not speak in this way in the public space
 tivi or twitor nahin tha
 Nor was the atmosphere like Meatu
 mitu abhiyaan aayaa tab shuru ke dinon un logon par sawaal uthe, jinka sambandh left yaa libral kheme se tha
 But even then no one directly rejected those questions
 unhen suna gaya or un sabhi ne apni safai di
 Nobody would have given it
 me tu ke is daur main bharat main kam se kam is baat ko lekar satarkta barti ja rahi ki koi kisi ko bevajaah badnaam na kar paae
 Many media institutions have written to MJ Akbar to know his side
 jawaab kaa intazaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Seema Mustafa, who has worked with MJ Akbar, has written
 di citision website par
 With the caveat that these are his personal views, not The Citizen's editorial policy
 seemaa mustafa ne apane lekh kii shuruyaat main mitu abhiyaan ke taur tareekon par bhi sawaal uthaae hai
 Seema also has a problem with the Meitu movement
 seemaa kii ek baat thik he ki bina jaanch ke, bina pramaan ke kaiyon kii naukariyaan chali gayi
 Is that ok seemaa kaa lekh ek tarah se akbar kaa bachaav karata he
 He has written that the hotel in which he stayed in Delhi was part of his work, i or Kayo did not feel uncomfortable
 unka aisa anubhav nahin rahaa he
 The comments kai ladkiyaan thim jinaki aalochana akbar ke saamne nahin hoti thi, lekin aise kuch purush bhi thi jinke bare main akbar kuch bhi nahin sunate the
 We used to doubt a lot but there was no strong evidence
 kam se kam asian age ke offis ke bheetar to bilkul hi nahin
 There is only speculation
 pramaan kuch nahin he or yahi sach he, lekin jis maahaul main atakalein hon, kaanaafoosee hon wo jagah kaam karne ke liye anukool bhi nahin hoti he
 Seema Mustafa has also said that Akbar should be removed from the ministry
 gazala wahaab ne apane lekh main kaha he ki unhone seemaa mustafa ko bataaya tha ki unke saath kya hua he
 Seema Mustafa has written that Ghazala spoke to him but has not told all that he has written
 16 disambar 1999 main krishna prasad ne radiff main Editor the Great naam se ek lekh likhaa tha
 All these things are mentioned in the article which has been written by women journalists
 inhen likhte hue krishna prasad baar-baar poochhate hai ki "sir, are you Mr Editor the Great?" is lekh main akbar kaa naam nahin he
 But his column byline is frequently mentioned
 editor di great kaa zikr he
 Do you think that Prime Minister Modi will defend MJ Akbar? Akbar recently attacked Rahul Gandhi on the Rafale issue, calling his entire family a thief
 kya modi iske badale kah paaenge ki meraa akbar mahaan
 However, the Sangh does not like Akbar's greatness
 main itihaas vaale akbar kii baat kar rahaa tha
 This one's Akbar's English is very good
 bharat main angrezi acchhee ho to hukumat aapaki ho jaati he
 Bhaskar also featured on the front page on 9 October
 bihar kii rajdhani patna se manish kumaar ne bataaya ki sirf prabhaat khabar main he

 By the way, if you look according to the website, this is news in almost English digital media
 news channelon kaa hamane nahin dekha
 This is because the media has expanded, but is the news reaching the readers equally from all those platforms, is silence in a large part just a matter of editorial judgment? Imagine if a Hindi newspaper reaching 6 to 8 crore readers would not be able to print this news, nor would its readers know
 isliye pathak or darshak ko bhi badalanaa hoga
 He should check the information of any important event or news through several means
 loktantr main voter hona yaa pathak hona ai iti kii pravesh pariksha kii taiyaari se bhi mushkil kaam he
 Today another article has come in the context of Akbar
 gazala wahaab naam kii mahila patrkaar ne di vir main akbar ke saath hui apni aapbeetee bayaan kii he
 Ghazala Wahab is the executive editor of FORCE newsmagazine
 gazala wahaab ne likhaa he asian age ke aakhri chah maheene main halaat narak se badtar ho gaye the
 Ghazala has written that it was not easy to write the story of the Asian Age
 maine kaaphi sochaa ki bees saal baad ye bataanaa kya uchit rahegaa, lekin logon ke messej aate rahe ki tum kab likhogi
 She was in school when the father brought books written by Akbar
 unhen padhakar patrkaar banane kaa faisla kiya
 Joined The Asian Age in 1994
 maine logon ko yah kehete suna ki yah offis akbar kaa haram he
 The girls were very much there
 ladke kam the
 i used to listen to such gossip about who is related to whom
 har riginal offis main unke garlfrand hai
 In the third year, Asian Age office culture hurt me
 meri mez akbar ke offis ke baahar laga di gai
 He kept staring at me and sending obscene messages on the office network
 phir mujhe baatcheet ke bahaane cabin main bulaane lage
 Most of the conversations were private
 ek baar kamare main dictionari dekhne ke bahaane bula liya
 i was bent to lift the dictionary that Akbar grabbed me from behind
 mere hothon par ungliyaan pherane lage
 Turned my hand over my breasts
 maine khud ko chhudaane kii koshish kii magar usne kas ke jakad liya tha
 i somehow escaped and escaped from the cabin
 toilet main jaakar rone lagi
 i told myself not to let it happen again
 main uski garlfrand nahin bananaa chaahati thi
 But i did not know that the tortures were about to begin
 agle din phir bulaayaa or kis karne kaa prayaas kiya
 i kept myself free, but there was no place
 phir usne mujhe chhod diya
 i ran
 daftar se baahar bhaagi
 Surya Kiran ran outside the building
 ek sunsaan jagah par jaakar rone lagi
 Whatever happened to Ghazala Wahab, much of what he has written, was left in translation
 maine chhod diya kyonki mujhase nahin likhaa gaya
 The anonymous woman who wrote a memoir about MJ Akbar on the First Post website is equally frightening
 aap pard nahin sakate
 i do not know what is creating a stir within the Modi government after reading all these articles, why the BJP spokesperson became so calm
 akbar ko bachaane ke liye sari sarkaar lagi hui he yaa sarkaar ne akbar se kinaaraa kar liya he
 Prime Minister Modi has not spoken yet
 yah khabar ab manage karne ke daayre se baahar ja chuki he
 Therefore, it is the test of Iqbal of this government and also of Akbar
 jahaan mahaz aarope lagane par kai patrakaron ne istife de diya lekin jis sampadak par itane gambhir aarope lage hai, kya koi ection nahin hoga, jaanch kii ghoshnaa tak nahin hui he
 It is possible that if the government is taking time to take a decision, then it has every right
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki nae videsh rajya mantri kii talash ho rahi ho jinaki angrezi akbar se acchhee ho to isamen bhi koi buraai nahin he
 But according to the government, what is right and what is not right, it will be known only when the answer is found
 gazala wahaab apane parivaar kii pehali ladki thim, shahar or ghar se baahar aakar naukari karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 Ghazala is the seventh woman journalist to have written her memoirs about MJ Akbar in public
 kul 9 mahila patrakaron ne emje akbar ko lekar aapbeetee bataai he
 Someone has written an article
 kisi ne bayaan diya he
 Someone tweeted
 sutapa paul, newcrop kii sansthaapak sampadak hai, unhone bhi aapbeetee likhi he
 Sutpa Paul has tweeted 32 on the evening of 10 October and described how Akbar made efforts to build a relationship while working at the Kolkata bureau of India Today
 yah sari baaten 2010-11 kii hai
 You heard a small part of Ghazala Wahab's tragedy
 priya ramani ne to 1997 main hi likhaa tha magar naam nahin liya, lekin is baar naam le liya
 Prerna Singh Bindra has written her objection in The Wire
 suma rahaa ne bhi aapbeetee bataai ki kaise hotel ke kamare main intervyuu ke dauraan ve asahaj ho gayi or naukari kaa prastaav sweekaar nahin kiya
 Kanika Gehlot has told the Indian Express that she too was called to the hotel but she did not go, but since then Akbar has done nothing
 ek anaam mahila patrkaar ne first post main likhaa he
 That description is also shining
 prem panikar ne bhi apni aapbeetee likhi he
 Suparna Sharma, who is currently the Resident Editor of The Asian Age, told The Indian Express that Akbar made a vulgar gesture to her
 em je akbar par 9 mahila patrakaron ne gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 Can the Government of India put such a person in the Cabinet even for a moment
 yah sarkaar bataa sakati he
 The statement of 9 women journalists is in front
 unki aapbeetee saamne he
 These are all in the shape of accusations
 kathith rup se
 Is it not easy to write what Ghazala Wahab has written even after fifty years? iskaa kanoonee mahatv kya he, is par bahes ho sakati he, lekin saat mahila patrakaron kaa baahar aakar bolnaa, saare prasang or sandarbh ke saath likhnaa kya unke liye aasaan rahaa hoga
 Therefore, the allegations made on MJ Akbar need to be answered
 modi sarkaar kya faisla karegi wo jane, bahut se log in 9 mahila patrakaron ke bare main kai sawaalon ke saath sochenge, magar priya ramani kii bhatiji ne apni chachee ko likhaa he
 To the aunt
 antee priya mujhe aap par garv he ki aapane ye sab likhaa
 You are giving a very important message to the world
 mere skool main ham ladikayaan bees minute ke liye adwiseri class main in sab muddon par baat karte hai
 We discussed Kavanog and Vensteen
 ham apane class main aap jo kar rahi hai, us par bhi charchaa karenge
 i will show you how all the women of the world need to raise their voices together
 iti cell is maamle ke aane ke baad media trial ke matlab ko samaj gaya he
 Otherwise, instead of MJ Akbar, you would have seen the same allegations in IT cell and TV channels
 phir bhi main nahin chahta ki kisi kaa media trial ho
 Many women journalists who support Me Two are constantly highlighting the difference between Twitter and Facebook as to which allegations would be considered as serious and which would not be considered as metu
 emje akbar ke bare main mahila patrakaron ne jo prasang sunaaen hai, sabamein akbar hamalavar hai
 They do not wait for consent, do not make relations, but are broken

 Twenty years ago, women did not speak in this way in the public space
 tivi or twitor nahin tha
 Nor was the atmosphere like Meatu
 mitu abhiyaan aayaa tab shuru ke dinon un logon par sawaal uthe, jinka sambandh left yaa libral kheme se tha
 But even then no one directly rejected those questions
 unhen suna gaya or un sabhi ne apni safai di
 Nobody would have given it
 me tu ke is daur main bharat main kam se kam is baat ko lekar satarkta barti ja rahi ki koi kisi ko bevajaah badnaam na kar paae
 Many media institutions have written to MJ Akbar to know his side
 jawaab kaa intazaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Seema Mustafa, who has worked with MJ Akbar, has written
 di citision website par
 With the caveat that these are his personal views, not The Citizen's editorial policy
 seemaa mustafa ne apane lekh kii shuruyaat main mitu abhiyaan ke taur tareekon par bhi sawaal uthaae hai
 Seema also has a problem with the Meitu movement
 seemaa kii ek baat thik he ki bina jaanch ke, bina pramaan ke kaiyon kii naukariyaan chali gayi
 Is that ok seemaa kaa lekh ek tarah se akbar kaa bachaav karata he
 He has written that the hotel in which he stayed in Delhi was part of his work, i or Kayo did not feel uncomfortable
 unka aisa anubhav nahin rahaa he
 The comments kai ladkiyaan thim jinaki aalochana akbar ke saamne nahin hoti thi, lekin aise kuch purush bhi thi jinke bare main akbar kuch bhi nahin sunate the
 We used to doubt a lot but there was no strong evidence
 kam se kam asian age ke offis ke bheetar to bilkul hi nahin
 There is only speculation
 pramaan kuch nahin he or yahi sach he, lekin jis maahaul main atakalein hon, kaanaafoosee hon wo jagah kaam karne ke liye anukool bhi nahin hoti he
 Seema Mustafa has also said that Akbar should be removed from the ministry
 gazala wahaab ne apane lekh main kaha he ki unhone seemaa mustafa ko bataaya tha ki unke saath kya hua he
 Seema Mustafa has written that Ghazala spoke to him but has not told all that he has written
 16 disambar 1999 main krishna prasad ne radiff main Editor the Great naam se ek lekh likhaa tha
 All these things are mentioned in the article which has been written by women journalists
 inhen likhte hue krishna prasad baar-baar poochhate hai ki "sir, are you Mr Editor the Great?" is lekh main akbar kaa naam nahin he
 But his column byline is frequently mentioned
 editor di great kaa zikr he
 Do you think that Prime Minister Modi will defend MJ Akbar? Akbar recently attacked Rahul Gandhi on the Rafale issue, calling his entire family a thief
 kya modi iske badale kah paaenge ki meraa akbar mahaan
 However, the Sangh does not like Akbar's greatness
 main itihaas vaale akbar kii baat kar rahaa tha
 This one's Akbar's English is very good
 bharat main angrezi acchhee ho to hukumat aapaki ho jaati he
 On October 10, the Indian Express reported the allegations on Akbar on the front page
 heading he ki chah mahilaon ne awaz uthaai, mantri akbar par sexual harasment ke aarope lagaae jab ve sampadak the

 main itihaas vaale akbar kii baat kar rahaa tha
 This one's Akbar's English is very good
 bharat main angrezi acchhee ho to hukumat aapaki ho jaati he
 Ghazala Wahab has written that in the last six months of the Asian Age, the situation got worse from hell
 gazala ne likhaa he ki asian age kii kahani likhnaa aasaan nahin tha
 i thought enough that it would be appropriate to tell after twenty years, but the messages of people kept coming when you would write
 skool main thi jab pita ne akbar kii likhin kitaaben laakar di thim
 Decided to study them and become a journalist
 1994 main di asian age jwine kiya
 i heard people saying that this office is Akbar's harem
 vahaan ladkiyaan bahut zyada thim
 The boys were few
 main is tarah kii gaship sunati thi ki kisase rishte hai
 He has girlfriends in every regional office
 tisare saal asian age ke offis culture ne mujhpe chot kii
 My table was placed outside Akbar's office
 wo mujhe ghoorte rahete the or offis ke network par ashleel massej bhejte rahete the
 Then i started calling in the cabin on the pretext of conversation
 zyaadaatar baatcheet nijee kism kii hoti thi
 Once on the pretext of looking at the dictionary in the room
 main dictionari uthaane ke liye jhuki hi thi ki akbar ne mujhe peeche se pakad liya
 Fingers started turning on my lips
 mere stanon par haath pherane laga
 i tried to free myself but he was held tight
 main kisi tarah chhudaa kar cabin se bhaagi
 She started crying in the toilet
 maine khud se kaha ki dobaaraa nahin hone duungi
 i did not want to be his girlfriend
 lekin mujhe nahin pataa tha ki yaatnaaon kii shuruyaat hone vaali he
 Called again the next day and tried to kiss
 main khud ko chhudaati rahi, lekin vahaan koi jagah nahin thi
 Then he left me
 main bhaagi
 Ran out of the office
 surya kiran building ke baahar bhaagi
 She went to a secluded place and started crying
 gazala wahaab ke saath jo kuch hua, unhone jo likhaa he, uskaa bahut hissaa anuwaad main chhot gaya
 i left because i did not write
 first post website par jis anaam mahila ne emje akbar ke bare main sansmaran likhaa he, wo bhi itnaa hi bhayaavah he
 You can't read mujhe nahin pataa ki ye saare lekh padhakar modi sarkaar ke bheetar kya halchal much rahi he, kyon bijepi ke pravaktaa itane shant ho gaye
 The whole government is engaged to save Akbar or the government has opted out of Akbar
 pradhanmantri modi ne abhi tak nahin bolaa he
 This news has now gone beyond the scope of management
 isliye yah is sarkaar ke ikbaal kaa imtahaan he or akbar kaa bhi
 While many journalists resigned only on accusations, but the editor who is facing such serious allegations, will there be any action, the investigation has not been announced
 mumkin he sarkaar faisla lene main vakt le rahi ho, to use puraa haq he
 It could also be that a new Minister of State for External Affairs is looking for a person whose English is better than Akbar's
 magar sarkaar ke hisaab se kya thik he kya thik nahin he ye tabhi pataa chalegaa jab jawaab milegaa
 Ghazala Wahab was the first girl in her family, decided to come out of the city and home to work
 gazala saatvin mahila patrkaar hai, jinhone public main emje akbar ko lekar apane sansmaran likhe hai
 a total of 9 women journalists have spoken out about MJ Akbar
 kisi ne lekh likhaa he
 Someone has given a statement
 kisi ne twit kiya he
 Sutpa Paul, the founding editor of newcrop, has also written an episode
 sutapa paul ne 10 aktubar kii shaam 32 twit kiye hai or bataae hai ki kaise india today ke kolkata beuro main kaam karne ke dauraan akbar ne sambandh banane ke prayaas kiye
 All these things belong to 2010-11
 gazala wahaab kii aapbeetee kaa ek chota sa hissaa aapane suna
 Priya Ramani had written in 1997 but did not take the name, but took the name this time
 prerana singh bindra ne di vir main apni aapbeetee likhi he
 Suma Raha also told you how she became uncomfortable during the interview in the hotel room and did not accept the job offer
 kanika gahalout ne indian express ko bataaya he ki use bhi hotel main bulaayaa tha magar wo nahin gai, lekin uske baad se akbar ne kuch nahin kiya
 An anonymous female journalist has written in First Post
 wo vivaran bhi sihara dene vaala he
 Prem Panicker has also written his objection
 suparna sharma jo is vakt di asian age kii resident editor hai, unhone indian express se kaha he ki akbar ne unhen ashleel ishaara kiya
 9 women journalists have made serious allegations against MJ Akbar
 kya bharat sarkaar aise vyakti ko ek pal ke liye bhi mantrimandal main rakh sakati he
 This government can tell
 9 mahila patrakaron kaa bayaan saamne he
 Their emergency is in front
 ye sab aarope kii shakl main hai
 Allegedly
 gazala wahaab ne jo likhaa he use bees saal baad kya pachaas saal baad bhi likhnaa aasaan nahin he
 What is the legal significance of this can be debated, but it must have been easy for seven women journalists to come out and speak, write with all the context and context
 isliye emje akbar par jo aarope lagaae hai, us par unka jawaab zaruri he
 Know what the Modi government will decide, many people will think about these 9 women journalists with many questions, but Priya Ramani's niece has written to her aunt
 aant ko
 Aunt Priya i am proud of you that you wrote all this
 aap ek bahut zaruri massej duniya ko de rahi hai
 In my school we girls talk about all these issues in advisory class for twenty minutes
 hamane kawanog or venstin ke bare main charchaa kii
 We will also discuss what you are doing in our class
 maine aapkaa likhaa dikhaaungi ki kaise duniya kii sabhi auraton ko milakar awaz uthaane kii zarurat he
 The IT cell has come to understand the meaning of a media trial since the case came up
 varna yahi aarope emje akbar kii jagah kisi or par lage hote to aap iti cell or tivi channelon main tufaan dekhte
 Still i do not want anyone to have a media trial
 me tu kaa samarthan karne vaali kai mahila patrkaar lagaataar twitor or fasebuk par is antar ko rekhaankit kar rahi hai ki iske tahat koun se aarope gambhir maane jaaenge or koun se mitu nahin maane jaaenge
 Akbar is the attacker among women journalists who have narrated about MJ Akbar
 wo razaamandi kaa intazaar nahin karte, sambandh bhi nahin banaate, balki tut padate hai
 Twenty years ago there was no Visakha Committee
 bees saal pehle is tarah se public spes main mahilaayein nahin bolti thim
 There was no TV and Twitter
 na hi mitu jaisaa maahaul tha
 When the Meitu campaign came, questions were raised on those people who were related to the Left or Liberal camp
 magar tab bhi un sawaalon ko kisi ne sidhe khaarij nahin kiya
 They were heard and they all gave their clarification
 kisi ne nahin bhi di hogi
 In this era of Me Too, caution is being exercised in India at least on the fact that no one can malign someone unnecessarily
 kai media sansthaanon ne emje akbar se unka paksh jaanane ke liye likhaa he
 Awaiting reply
 emje akbar ke saath kaam kar chuki seemaa mustafa ne likhaa he
 On The Citizen website
 is chetavanee ke saath ki ye unke nijee vichaar hai na ki di citision kii sampadakeey niti he
 Seema Mustafa in the beginning of his article has also questioned the modus operandi of the metoo campaign
 seemaa ko mitu andolan ke tevar se bhi samasya he
 One thing of the border is right that many jobs have gone without investigation, without proof
 kya ye thik he
 Seema's article defends Akbar in a way
 unhone likhaa he ki dilli main jis hotel main rukte the wo unke kaam kaa hissaa tha, mujhe yaa kaiyo ko asahaj nahin laga
 He has not had such experience
 tippaniyan There were many girls who were not criticized in front of Akbar, but there were some men about whom Akbar did not listen to anything
 ham bahut kuch shaq karte the magar koi pukhta pramaan nahin hota tha
 At least not within the Asian Age office
 keval atakalbaazi he
 The evidence is nothing and this is true, but the environment in which there is speculation, whisper is not suitable for working
 seemaa mustafa ne yah bhi kaha he ki akbar ko mantripad se hataa dena chahie
 Ghazala Wahab has said in his article that he told Seema Mustafa what has happened to him
 seemaa mustafa ne likhaa he ki gazala ne unase baat kii thi magar ye sab nahin bataaya he jo unhone likhaa he
 On 16 December 1999, Krishna Prasad wrote an article in Rediff titled Editor the Great
 us lekh main in sab baton kaa zikr he jise mahila patrakaron ne likhaa he
 Writing to them, Krishna Prasad repeatedly asks "sir, are you Mr Editor the Great?" Akbar is not named in this article
 magar unke kollam biline kaa baar-baar zikr he
 The editor is referring to the great
 kya aapako lagata he ki pradhanmantri modi emje akbar kaa bachaav karenge? akbar ne haal hi main rafel mudde par rahul gandhi par hamalaa karte hue unke puure khandaan ko chor kaha tha
 Will Modi be able to say instead that my great Akbar
 vaise akbar kaa mahaan hona sangh ko acha nahin lagata he
 i was talking about Akbar with history
 is vaale akbar kii angrezi bahut acchhee he
 If English is good in India, then it becomes your rule
 gazala wahaab ke saath jo kuch hua, unhone jo likhaa he, uskaa bahut hissaa anuwaad main chhot gaya
 i left because i did not write
 first post website par jis anaam mahila ne emje akbar ke bare main sansmaran likhaa he, wo bhi itnaa hi bhayaavah he
 You can't read mujhe nahin pataa ki ye saare lekh padhakar modi sarkaar ke bheetar kya halchal much rahi he, kyon bijepi ke pravaktaa itane shant ho gaye
 The whole government is engaged to save Akbar or the government has opted out of Akbar
 pradhanmantri modi ne abhi tak nahin bolaa he
 This news has now gone beyond the scope of management
 isliye yah is sarkaar ke ikbaal kaa imtahaan he or akbar kaa bhi
 While many journalists resigned only on accusations, but the editor who is facing such serious allegations, will there be any action, the investigation has not been announced
 mumkin he sarkaar faisla lene main vakt le rahi ho, to use puraa haq he
 It could also be that a new Minister of State for External Affairs is looking for a person whose English is better than Akbar's
 magar sarkaar ke hisaab se kya thik he kya thik nahin he ye tabhi pataa chalegaa jab jawaab milegaa
 Ghazala Wahab was the first girl in her family, decided to come out of the city and home to work
 gazala saatvin mahila patrkaar hai, jinhone public main emje akbar ko lekar apane sansmaran likhe hai
 a total of 9 women journalists have spoken out about MJ Akbar
 kisi ne lekh likhaa he
 Someone has given a statement
 kisi ne twit kiya he
 Sutpa Paul, the founding editor of newcrop, has also written an episode
 sutapa paul ne 10 aktubar kii shaam 32 twit kiye hai or bataae hai ki kaise india today ke kolkata beuro main kaam karne ke dauraan akbar ne sambandh banane ke prayaas kiye
 All these things belong to 2010-11
 gazala wahaab kii aapbeetee kaa ek chota sa hissaa aapane suna
 Priya Ramani had written in 1997 but did not take the name, but took the name this time
 prerana singh bindra ne di vir main apni aapbeetee likhi he
 Suma Raha also told you how she became uncomfortable during the interview in the hotel room and did not accept the job offer
 kanika gahalout ne indian express ko bataaya he ki use bhi hotel main bulaayaa tha magar wo nahin gai, lekin uske baad se akbar ne kuch nahin kiya
 An anonymous female journalist has written in First Post
 wo vivaran bhi sihara dene vaala he
 Prem Panicker has also written his objection
 suparna sharma jo is vakt di asian age kii resident editor hai, unhone indian express se kaha he ki akbar ne unhen ashleel ishaara kiya
 9 women journalists have made serious allegations against MJ Akbar
 kya bharat sarkaar aise vyakti ko ek pal ke liye bhi mantrimandal main rakh sakati he
 This government can tell
 9 mahila patrakaron kaa bayaan saamne he
 Their emergency is in front
 ye sab aarope kii shakl main hai
 Allegedly
 gazala wahaab ne jo likhaa he use bees saal baad kya pachaas saal baad bhi likhnaa aasaan nahin he
 What is the legal significance of this can be debated, but it must have been easy for seven women journalists to come out and speak, write with all the context and context
 isliye emje akbar par jo aarope lagaae hai, us par unka jawaab zaruri he
 Know what the Modi government will decide, many people will think about these 9 women journalists with many questions, but Priya Ramani's niece has written to her aunt
 aant ko
 Aunt Priya i am proud of you that you wrote all this
 aap ek bahut zaruri massej duniya ko de rahi hai
 In my school we girls talk about all these issues in advisory class for twenty minutes
 hamane kawanog or venstin ke bare main charchaa kii
 We will also discuss what you are doing in our class
 maine aapkaa likhaa dikhaaungi ki kaise duniya kii sabhi auraton ko milakar awaz uthaane kii zarurat he
 The IT cell has come to understand the meaning of a media trial since the case came up
 varna yahi aarope emje akbar kii jagah kisi or par lage hote to aap iti cell or tivi channelon main tufaan dekhte
 Still i do not want anyone to have a media trial
 me tu kaa samarthan karne vaali kai mahila patrkaar lagaataar twitor or fasebuk par is antar ko rekhaankit kar rahi hai ki iske tahat koun se aarope gambhir maane jaaenge or koun se mitu nahin maane jaaenge
 Akbar is the attacker among women journalists who have narrated about MJ Akbar
 wo razaamandi kaa intazaar nahin karte, sambandh bhi nahin banaate, balki tut padate hai
 Twenty years ago there was no Visakha Committee
 bees saal pehle is tarah se public spes main mahilaayein nahin bolti thim
 There was no TV and Twitter
 na hi mitu jaisaa maahaul tha
 When the Meitu campaign came, questions were raised on those people who were related to the Left or Liberal camp
 magar tab bhi un sawaalon ko kisi ne sidhe khaarij nahin kiya
 They were heard and they all gave their clarification
 kisi ne nahin bhi di hogi
 In this era of Me Too, caution is being exercised in India at least on the fact that no one can malign someone unnecessarily
 kai media sansthaanon ne emje akbar se unka paksh jaanane ke liye likhaa he
 Awaiting reply
 emje akbar ke saath kaam kar chuki seemaa mustafa ne likhaa he
 On The Citizen website
 is chetavanee ke saath ki ye unke nijee vichaar hai na ki di citision kii sampadakeey niti he
 Seema Mustafa in the beginning of his article has also questioned the modus operandi of the metoo campaign
 seemaa ko mitu andolan ke tevar se bhi samasya he
 One thing of the border is right that many jobs have gone without investigation, without proof
 kya ye thik he
 Seema's article defends Akbar in a way
 unhone likhaa he ki dilli main jis hotel main rukte the wo unke kaam kaa hissaa tha, mujhe yaa kaiyo ko asahaj nahin laga
 He has not had such experience
 tippaniyan There were many girls who were not criticized in front of Akbar, but there were some men about whom Akbar did not listen to anything
 ham bahut kuch shaq karte the magar koi pukhta pramaan nahin hota tha
 At least not within the Asian Age office
 keval atakalbaazi he
 The evidence is nothing and this is true, but the environment in which there is speculation, whisper is not suitable for working
 seemaa mustafa ne yah bhi kaha he ki akbar ko mantripad se hataa dena chahie
 Ghazala Wahab has said in his article that he told Seema Mustafa what has happened to him
 seemaa mustafa ne likhaa he ki gazala ne unase baat kii thi magar ye sab nahin bataaya he jo unhone likhaa he
 On 16 December 1999, Krishna Prasad wrote an article in Rediff titled Editor the Great
 us lekh main in sab baton kaa zikr he jise mahila patrakaron ne likhaa he
 Writing to them, Krishna Prasad repeatedly asks "sir, are you Mr Editor the Great?" Akbar is not named in this article
 magar unke kollam biline kaa baar-baar zikr he
 The editor is referring to the great
 kya aapako lagata he ki pradhanmantri modi emje akbar kaa bachaav karenge? akbar ne haal hi main rafel mudde par rahul gandhi par hamalaa karte hue unke puure khandaan ko chor kaha tha
 Will Modi be able to say instead that my great Akbar
 vaise akbar kaa mahaan hona sangh ko acha nahin lagata he
 i was talking about Akbar with history
 is vaale akbar kii angrezi bahut acchhee he
 If English is good in India, then it becomes your rule
 gazala wahaab apane parivaar kii pehali ladki thim, shahar or ghar se baahar aakar naukari karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 Ghazala is the seventh woman journalist to have written her memoirs about MJ Akbar in public
 kul 9 mahila patrakaron ne emje akbar ko lekar aapbeetee bataai he
 Someone has written an article
 kisi ne bayaan diya he
 Someone tweeted
 sutapa paul, newcrop kii sansthaapak sampadak hai, unhone bhi aapbeetee likhi he
 Sutpa Paul has tweeted 32 on the evening of 10 October and described how Akbar made efforts to build a relationship while working at the Kolkata bureau of India Today
 yah sari baaten 2010-11 kii hai
 You heard a small part of Ghazala Wahab's tragedy
 priya ramani ne to 1997 main hi likhaa tha magar naam nahin liya, lekin is baar naam le liya
 Prerna Singh Bindra has written her objection in The Wire
 suma rahaa ne bhi aapbeetee bataai ki kaise hotel ke kamare main intervyuu ke dauraan ve asahaj ho gayi or naukari kaa prastaav sweekaar nahin kiya
 Kanika Gehlot has told the Indian Express that she too was called to the hotel but she did not go, but since then Akbar has done nothing
 ek anaam mahila patrkaar ne first post main likhaa he
 That description is also shining
 prem panikar ne bhi apni aapbeetee likhi he
 Suparna Sharma, who is currently the Resident Editor of The Asian Age, told The Indian Express that Akbar made a vulgar gesture to her
 em je akbar par 9 mahila patrakaron ne gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 Can the Government of India put such a person in the Cabinet even for a moment
 yah sarkaar bataa sakati he
 The statement of 9 women journalists is in front
 unki aapbeetee saamne he
 These are all in the shape of accusations
 kathith rup se
 Is it not easy to write what Ghazala Wahab has written even after fifty years? iskaa kanoonee mahatv kya he, is par bahes ho sakati he, lekin saat mahila patrakaron kaa baahar aakar bolnaa, saare prasang or sandarbh ke saath likhnaa kya unke liye aasaan rahaa hoga
 Therefore, the allegations made on MJ Akbar need to be answered
 modi sarkaar kya faisla karegi wo jane, bahut se log in 9 mahila patrakaron ke bare main kai sawaalon ke saath sochenge, magar priya ramani kii bhatiji ne apni chachee ko likhaa he
 To the aunt
 antee priya mujhe aap par garv he ki aapane ye sab likhaa
 You are giving a very important message to the world
 mere skool main ham ladikayaan bees minute ke liye adwiseri class main in sab muddon par baat karte hai
 We discussed Kavanog and Vensteen
 ham apane class main aap jo kar rahi hai, us par bhi charchaa karenge
 i will show you how all the women of the world need to raise their voices together
 iti cell is maamle ke aane ke baad media trial ke matlab ko samaj gaya he
 Otherwise, instead of MJ Akbar, you would have seen the same allegations in IT cell and TV channels
 phir bhi main nahin chahta ki kisi kaa media trial ho
 Many women journalists who support Me Two are constantly highlighting the difference between Twitter and Facebook as to which allegations would be considered as serious and which would not be considered as metu
 emje akbar ke bare main mahila patrakaron ne jo prasang sunaaen hai, sabamein akbar hamalavar hai
 They do not wait for consent, do not make relations, but are broken
 bees saal pehle vishakha cameti nahin thi
 Twenty years ago, women did not speak in this way in the public space
 tivi or twitor nahin tha
 Nor was the atmosphere like Meatu
 mitu abhiyaan aayaa tab shuru ke dinon un logon par sawaal uthe, jinka sambandh left yaa libral kheme se tha
 But even then no one directly rejected those questions
 unhen suna gaya or un sabhi ne apni safai di
 Nobody would have given it
 me tu ke is daur main bharat main kam se kam is baat ko lekar satarkta barti ja rahi ki koi kisi ko bevajaah badnaam na kar paae
 Many media institutions have written to MJ Akbar to know his side
 jawaab kaa intazaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Seema Mustafa, who has worked with MJ Akbar, has written
 di citision website par
 With the caveat that these are his personal views, not The Citizen's editorial policy
 seemaa mustafa ne apane lekh kii shuruyaat main mitu abhiyaan ke taur tareekon par bhi sawaal uthaae hai
 Seema also has a problem with the Meitu movement
 seemaa kii ek baat thik he ki bina jaanch ke, bina pramaan ke kaiyon kii naukariyaan chali gayi
 Is that ok seemaa kaa lekh ek tarah se akbar kaa bachaav karata he
 He has written that the hotel in which he stayed in Delhi was part of his work, i or Kayo did not feel uncomfortable
 unka aisa anubhav nahin rahaa he
 The comments kai ladkiyaan thim jinaki aalochana akbar ke saamne nahin hoti thi, lekin aise kuch purush bhi thi jinke bare main akbar kuch bhi nahin sunate the
 We used to doubt a lot but there was no strong evidence
 kam se kam asian age ke offis ke bheetar to bilkul hi nahin
 There is only speculation
 pramaan kuch nahin he or yahi sach he, lekin jis maahaul main atakalein hon, kaanaafoosee hon wo jagah kaam karne ke liye anukool bhi nahin hoti he
 Seema Mustafa has also said that Akbar should be removed from the ministry
 gazala wahaab ne apane lekh main kaha he ki unhone seemaa mustafa ko bataaya tha ki unke saath kya hua he
 Seema Mustafa has written that Ghazala spoke to him but has not told all that he has written
 16 disambar 1999 main krishna prasad ne radiff main Editor the Great naam se ek lekh likhaa tha
 All these things are mentioned in the article which has been written by women journalists
 inhen likhte hue krishna prasad baar-baar poochhate hai ki "sir, are you Mr Editor the Great?" is lekh main akbar kaa naam nahin he
 But his column byline is frequently mentioned
 editor di great kaa zikr he
 Do you think that Prime Minister Modi will defend MJ Akbar? Akbar recently attacked Rahul Gandhi on the Rafale issue, calling his entire family a thief
 kya modi iske badale kah paaenge ki meraa akbar mahaan
 However, the Sangh does not like Akbar's greatness
 main itihaas vaale akbar kii baat kar rahaa tha

 As soon as these questions were asked, Babbar would have to withdraw his statement

 No MP has the right to disclose this, even if he is an actor

 To kill is to be a mid-day meal
 agar aap kii kamai 31 rupee rojaanaa he
 So according to Montek meter, you are a poor person
 isse ek rupee bhi zyada kamaaya to aap vijay maalya vaali katigari main aa jaaenge
 Could not be rich, could not be poor
 khayr to kissa ye he ki aapke paas 31 rupee hai or aapane sadak kinare teen samose kha liye
 So what is left? One rupee
 ab itane main ghar kaise pahunchoge? indira gandhi muft transport yojana to agali upie sarkaar laaegi
 She will come when you vote like Raj Babbar, Rashid Masood and Farooq Abdullah
 vah din jaldi aayega jab aap ko ye dyside karnaa padegaa ki 30 rupee ke 3 samose khaake muft yatra kii yojana kaa laabh uthaanaa he yaa nahin

 The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) political editor has said that Prime Minister David Cameron had warned the BBC to shut down during his campaign for the general election on 7 May

 BBC political editor Nick Robinson said he was not sure whether Cameron had said such a joke or had actually warned, although he admitted that it had put BBC staff under pressure
 robinsan ne kaha ki prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan camran ne bibisi kii ek khabar par 'naaraazgi' jaahir kii thi
 In this news, the BBC claimed that Cameron had told Nick Clegg, the former leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, that the Conservative Party would not get a majority
 jiske baad camran ne kaha tha, 'chunaav ke baad main bibisi ko band karvaa duungaa
 However, the Conservative Party was successful in securing a majority in the elections
 samachar patr 'da gardian' ne robinson ke hawaale se kaha, 'sabase ahm baat yah he ki iskaa anya logon par kya asar padaa
 Some people who boarded the bus found it funny, but were not among those who worked for the BBC

 Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar has resigned from the post of Defense Minister in the rapidly changing political developments after the Goa Assembly elections
 unhone pradhanmantri ko apana istipha saunp diya he
 Now he will take oath as Goa's Chief Minister once again at 5 pm on 14 March
 bijepi ko samarthan dene vaali emjeepi ke netaa sudhir dhavlikar ko upmukhyamantri banaaya jayega
 In fact, earlier Goa Governor Mridula Sinha invited BJP leader and Union Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar to form the government
 parrikar ne ravivaar ko hi rajyapal se mulaakaat kar sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya tha
 The Governor has asked Parrikar to prove his majority within 15 days after his swearing in
 gauratlab he ki pehle media main aisi khabaren ai ki parrikar ne rakshaamantri ke pad se istipha de diya he lekin baad main nitin gadakari ne sthiti spasht karte hue bataaya tha ki shapath grahan kii taarikh tay hone ke baad hi parrikar rakshaamantri kaa pad chodenge
 Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said that the MGP and the Goa Forward told him that if Manohar Parrikar became the Chief Minister, he was ready to give support
 maine party adhyaksh amit shah ke samaksh goa ke vidhayakon kii baat rakhi
 He held discussions with Prime Minister Modi and the Parliamentary Board
 is puure ghatnakram ko lekar parrikar ne kaha ki party jo bhi faisla karegi, vah unhen maanya hoga or agar goa main unki jarurat he to vah raksha mantri kaa pad chhod denge
 Gadkari said that the party president and the parliamentary board had given me the right to take appropriate decisions
 jab main 21 vidhayakon ke samarthan ke prati aashwast ho gaya tab rajyapal se mulaakaat kar sarkaar banane daawa pesh kiya gaya
 The decision to make Parrikar as Chief Minister was approved in the meeting of newly elected Goa mlas on Sunday evening
 parrikar ne rajyapal se mulaakaat kar goa main sarkaar banane kaa daawa bhi pesh kiya he
 Parrikar has claimed the support of 21 mlas
 vidhayakon ke samarthan kaa patr lekar kendriya parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ke saath parrikar rajbhavan pahunche
 Significantly, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), which was ready to support the BJP, had put a condition that if Manohar Parrikar will be made the Chief Minister of Goa, then only he will give support
 MGP ke netaa sudhir dhavlikar ne mediakarmiyon se baatcheet main kaha tha ki ve bijepi ko satta main laane ke liye tabhi samarthan de sakate hai jab rakshaamantri manohar parrikar ko goa ke mukhyamantri pad kii jimmedaari di jaae
 The MGP has 3 elected mlas
 dhavlikar goa main mediakarmiyon se baat kar rahe the
 He made his point clear by writing a letter to BJP President Amit Shah
 goa main bijepi ko satta main laane ke liye 9 vidhayakon kii jarurat he
 In such a situation, denying the support of its old ally MGP would mean that the BJP gets away from the race for power
 dhavlikar ke manohar parrikar or bijepi se barkaraar rishton main khatas tab aayi jab lakshmikant parsekar ko goa kaa mukhyamantri banaaya gaya
 The MGP withdrew support to the BJP government after Parsekar's statement against MGP ministers
 iske baad MGP ne shivasena or goa suraksha manch ke saath gathjod kar bijepi ko chunauti di
 This alliance has won only 3 seats
 unke samarthan se bijepi 13 se 16 tak to pahunch jaaegi
 Apart from MGP, the Goa forward is also positive about Manohar Parrikar's leadership
 is gut ke paas bhi 3 vidhayakon kaa sankhyabal he
 Gut leader Vijay Sardesai told the media in Goa that Parrikar was a better person than the Congress
 congress ne goa forward ke ummidavaaron ko pratadit kiya he
 In such a situation, how will it be possible to support the Congress? With the support of Goa Forward too, BJP will get closer to majority and it can have the support of 19 mlas
 tippaniyan There are now 3 independent mlas in Goa
 inamen rohan khanvate, govind gaavade or prasad gaanvkar shaamil hai
 Everyone's eyes are on his attitude
 inamen se seve goa front ke prasad gaanvkar ko bijepi ne samarthan de kar chunaav main utaara he or jisase bijepi gathbandhan kaa aankada 20 tak pahunch rahaa he
 While the remaining 2 independents, the Congress has placed its bet on Rohan Khawante
 goa prabharee or varisht congress netaa digvijay singh ne samvaadadaata sammelan kar kaha ki rohan khanvate kii congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi se mulaaqaat ho chuki he or ve congress ke saath rahenge
 However, despite the support of Rohan Khawante and ncp's 1-1 MLA, the Congress alliance is lagging behind the MLA 1
 in paristhitiyon main siem banane ja rahe manohar parrikar ko 6 maheene ke bheetar goa vidhansabha kaa sadsy bananaa hoga
 For which the resignation of the current MLA is necessary
 darasal isse pehle goa kii rajyapal mridula sinha ne bhaajapa netaa or kendriya raksha mantri manohar parrikar ko sarkaar banane kaa nyotaa diya
 Parrikar met the Governor on Sunday and claimed to form the government
 rajyapal ne shapath grahan ke baad 15 dinon ke bheetar parrikar ko bahumat sabit karne ko kaha he
 It is worth mentioning that earlier there were reports in the media that Parrikar had resigned as the defense minister, but later Nitin Gadkari explained the situation and said that Parrikar will leave the post of defense minister only after the date of the swearing-in date is fixed
 kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ne bataaya ki emjeepi or goa forward ne unase kaha ki agar manohar parrikar mukhyamantri bane to wo samarthan dene ko taiyaar hai
 i presented the Goa mlas before the party president Amit Shah
 unhone pradhanmantri modi or sansadeey board se charchaa kii
 On this whole incident, Parrikar said that whatever decision the party will make, it will be valid and if he is needed in Goa, he will leave the post of Defense Minister
 gadakari ne kaha ki party adhyaksh or sansadeey board ne mujhe uchit nirnay lene kaa adhikaar diya tha
 When i was convinced of the support of 21 mlas, then i met the Governor and made a claim to form the government
 ravivaar shaam goa ke navnirvaachit vidhayakon kii baithak main parrikar ko mukhyamantri banane ke faisle par muhar lagi
 Parrikar has also met the Governor and submitted a claim to form the government in Goa
 parrikar ne 21 vidhayakon ke samarthan kaa daawa kiya he
 Parrikar along with Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari reached the Raj Bhavan with a letter of support from the mlas
 gauratlab he ki bijepi ko samarthan dene ke liye taiyaar maharashtravaadi gomantak party (MGP) ne shart rakhi thi ki agar manohar parrikar ko goa kaa mukhyamantri banaaya jayega tabhi wo samarthan degi
 MGP leader Sudhir Dhavalikar had told media persons that he can only support the BJP to bring it to power if Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar is given the responsibility of the post of Chief Minister of Goa
 MGP ke 3 vidhayak chunakar aae hai
 Dhavalikar was talking to media persons in Goa
 unhone bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko khat likhakar apni baat spasht kar di thi
 9 mlas are needed to bring BJP to power in Goa
 aise main apane puraane sahyogi MGP kaa miltaa samarthan nakaarne kaa matlab hoga ki bijepi satta kii daud se dur ho jaae
 The tense relationship between Dhavalikar's Manohar Parrikar and the BJP came when Laxmikant Parsekar was made the Chief Minister of Goa
 parsekar dwaara MGP ke mantriyon ke kilaaf die bayaan ke baad MGP ne BJP sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya tha
 After this, the MGP in alliance with Shiv Sena and Goa Suraksha Manch challenged the BJP
 is gathbandhan kii 3 seat par hi jeet hui he
 With his support, BJP will reach from 13 to 16
 MGP ke alaava goa forward bhi manohar parrikar ke netritv ko lekar sakaaratmak he
 This group also has a strength of 3 mlas
 gut ke netaa vijay saradesai ne goa main media se baatcheet main kaha ki congress ke mukaable parrikar achche vyakti hai
 The Congress has harassed Goa Forward candidates
 aise main congress ko samarthan dena kaise mumkin hoga? goa forward ke bhi samarthan se bijepi bahumat ke or kareeb pahunch jaaegi or uske paas 19 vidhayakon kaa samarthan ho saktaa he
 The comments goa main ab 3 nirdaleey vidhayak hai
 These include Rohan Khawante, Govind Gavade and Prasad Gaonkar
 inke rukh par sabaki nazren tiki hai
 Of these, BJP has fielded Prasad Gaonkar of Save Goa Front in the election and the BJP alliance's figure is reaching 20
 jabaki baaki bache 2 nirdaleeyon main se rohan khanvate par congress ne apana daanv lagaaya he
 Goa in-charge and senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh held a press conference and said that Rohan Khawante has met Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi and will be with Congress
 haalanki, rohan khanvate or ensipi ke 1-1 vidhayak ke samarthan ke baad bhi bijepi gathbandhan ke mukaable congress gathbandhan 1 vidhayak peeche he
 Manohar Parrikar, who is going to become CM under these circumstances, will have to be made a member of the Goa Legislative Assembly within 6 months
 jiske liye vartmaan vidhayak kaa istifa jaruri he
 It is worth mentioning that earlier there were reports in the media that Parrikar had resigned as the defense minister, but later Nitin Gadkari explained the situation and said that Parrikar will leave the post of defense minister only after the date of the swearing-in date is fixed
