 lakhanu main guuruuvaar ko samaajawaadee party ke kaddavar netaa or pradesh sarkaar main cabinet mantri ajam khan ne mujffarnagar dango ko lekar elahabaad hai court dwaara jari notice ke jawaab dene ke baad kaha ki unhen jo bhi kahana he wo court main kahenge
 The court is doing its work on the whole matter and the government will do its work
 ajam khan ne saath hi congress par dalit, pichhadon or musalamaanon ko dabaane or barbaad karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 He said that the Congress leader said that it is baseless to have many Dalit leaders, whereas the Congress itself is more than a century old party
 lekin usne khud dalit netaaon ko aage aane nahin diya or unhe nazarandaaj kiya he
 According to Azam Khan, 'the matter is in the court, that is to say, it will be said in the court
 aap jaanate hai ki ham kisi kaa paksh nahin lete jo file main nyochit hoga vahi karrwai hogi
 Nobody will be favored
 court apana kaam kar rahi he, sarkaar apana kaam karegi
 There is no conflict between the two
 ham apni baat kah rahe hai court kaa jo adhikaar he wo istemaal karegi
 The government is presenting its stand
 sanvaidhanik etbaar se aap kisi par pabandi nahin laga sakate hai
 You should think for yourself what our limits are, what is dignity
 'ajam khan ne kaha, 'pehali baat to ye he ki hamaare upar ek tippanee nahin hui he agar aap soshalmedia yaa eggbi par jaaenge to aapako bhi dar lagegaa
 If educated people will make such comments about us, then the results are not going to be very good
 'congress ke dalit netaaon ke bayaan par ajam khan ne kaha, 'kal congress ke ek netaa ne kaha ki koi dalit netaa nahin he
 There should be several lakh Dalit leaders
 chahie par koi sarkaar nahin chalati he
 Should no party stand but the Congress is proud that it has liberated the country at that time its name was Indian National Congress
 usee ke naam bigadate chale gaye aaj ek lambey rajnatik safar tay karne ke baad sonia gandhi or rahul ji uske bade netaa hai
 It is not understood that even after almost a century of history, the Congress could not produce a single Dalit leader
 agar is baat kii koshish kii hoti to lakhon dalit netaa hon ye kehane kii jarurat nahin ai hoti
 The Congress is credited for suppressing and ruining Dalits, backward and Muslims

 The Congress may make a big announcement about its youth vice-president Rahul Gandhi amidst a huge gathering of party workers on Friday
 rahul ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaaye jane kii charchaaen abhi bhi chaaron taraf khaasi sargarm hai
 However, the party leadership is also weighing other options
 masalan rahul ko chunaav abhiyaan samiti kaa prabharee banaaya jaae or yah bhi ki unhen party kaa kaaryakari adhyaksh niyukt kiya jaae
 Some party leaders say that it would be wrong to assume that the party is still going to declare 43-year-old Rahul as the prime ministerial candidate
 rahul gandhi isse pehle sarkaar main kisi jimmedaari ko sanbhaalane ko lekar hichakate dikhaai die hai, lekin is saal april may main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle unhone mangalvaar ko kaha tha ki vah congress ke sipaahi hai or party unhen jo bhi kaam degi vah karne ko taiyaar hai
 This further reinforced the speculation that he would compete with Narendra Modi in the prime ministerial bid
 rahul gandhi ne mangalvaar ko ek hindi dainik ko die intervyuu main kaha, 'main congress kaa sipaahi hum
 i will follow whatever order is given to me
 congress jo bhi kahegi, main karne ko taiyaar hum
 
 
 In our party, decisions are taken by senior leaders
 ' However, there is a feeling in the Congress that the electoral path of the party is difficult at the moment and in such a situation, it may be risky to declare Rahul as the Prime Ministerial candidate because if he is given such responsibility and the party does not perform well in the elections then She will lose her head

 rajagopalan baat karte aa rahe hai, lekin unke mutabik, ''centre sarkaar ise samajhane ke liye taiyaar hi nahin he
 "that is why, like the mandate movement in 2007, 25,000 people traveled from Gwalior to Delhi, when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh formed the National Land Reform Council and said that land disputes would be settled soon
 uske baad paanch varsh ho gaye, lekin is samiti kii ek baithak tak nahin kii gai
 Because of this, one lakh people started preparing to travel to Delhi

 Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh was sent along with Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Scindia to Gwalior on 2 October to celebrate Gandhi Jayanti
 yahaan aae ramesh ne hajaaron logon ko yah kahkar niraash kar diya ki jameen to rajyon kaa vishay he
 If the central government intervenes, it will be considered a blow to the federal structure
 vaise, unhone yah sweekaar kiya ki jis prakaar shiksha, van, swasthya par rashtriya niti he, usee prakaar bhoomi par bhi niti honi chahie
 For this, the draft of the National Land Reform Policy will be ready in the next six months
 unhone nae bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon kaa hawala diya or kaha ki sarkaar ne isamen punarvaas or purnsthaapan jaise mudde daale hai

 They will walk 12 km every day and will eat only once a day till they reach Delhi
 is march main vibhinn enjio ke 2,000 pratinidhi shaamil hai
 Rajagopalan says that they are walking the path of dialogue with dialogue and if the government also agrees to make a law to give land for farming or hut then Delhi march can stop, otherwise now the fight will be across Will be

 rajya bhar main hone vaali is yatra main sarkari vimaan se lekar lakjri gaadi main pherbadal karke taiyaar kiye gaye vaahan, sabakaa istemaal ho rahaa he
 Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh had flagged off the first leg of the yatra in Dantewada on May 12 and is now going to conclude a month later on June 10 in Ambikapur where BJP president Amit Shah will also be present at the road show
 yatra kaa doosraa charan agast ke ant main hona he or yah chunaav aachaar samhita lagu hone tak chalata rahegaa
 Raman Singh's convoy of trains passing through each village stops at block headquarters where the Chief Minister addresses the people and reminds them of the development work done during the last 15 years

 During the first phase, Raman Singh's visit went to the assembly constituencies including the two seats where the BJP hopes to win unilaterally
 raman singh jab bhi sadak maarg se chalate hai, apane vidhayakon ke bare main feedback lete rahete hai
 Opposition is naturally opposed to Raman Singh's visit

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech in the Rajya Sabha responding to the discussion on the President's address has now become part of the Rajya Sabha's record
 is record main pradhanmantri ke saujany se gaalib ke naam ek aisa sher darj he jo gaalib kaa nahin he
 Actually it is not even a lion
 sher kaa apana ek anushaasan hota he jisase shaayari kii duniya se saamaanya parichay rakhane vaale log bhi mote taur par parichit hote hai
 Don't be familiar with the discipline of Prime Minister shero-shayari - there is nothing bad about it
 isse unke kaamkaaj kii yogyata par asar nahin padataa
 We have also seen Prime Ministers who are called poets but in the eyes of poetic admirers they did not have the understanding of fine poetry
 vaise pradhanmantri modi ke parichay main bhi kahin-kahin unke kavi hone kaa bhi ullekh miltaa he
 This shows that the Prime Minister wishes to be a poet
 yah kaamana bhi apane-aap main buree baat nahin he
 But when the Prime Minister reads a wrong lion in the Rajya Sabha by the name of the country's famous poet, it is a serious matter
 ham sab jaanate hai ki soshal media par sahitya or shero-shaayari ko lekar ek arajak maahaul he
 Any good or bad lion can be run in the name of Ghalib, Gulzar, Harivansh Rai Bachchan or Dinkar
 isi tarah kai samakaleen lekhakon kii acchhee rachanaaen kabhi mahadevi verma or kabhi amrutha preetam ke naam se chalaa di jaati hai
 But such a work cannot be accepted on any official platform
 pichley dinon hindi ke ek patrika 'vagarth' ne samakaleen kavyitri baabush kohli kii kaviya 'vasiyat' amrutha preetam ke naam se chhap di
 Some newspapers have also made such mistakes
 iske pehle bhopal kii ek kavyitri nidhi saxena kii ek kavita mahasweta devi or mahadevi verma ke naam se chalaai jaati rahi
 On the new year, a poem started in the name of Dinkar which was not of Dinkar
 magar rajyasabha main pradhanmantri dwaara kii gai galati ko in aam galatiyon kii shrenee main nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 No wrong facts should be known in the proceedings of Rajya Sabha
 aisa nahin ki isse gaalib ko koi nuqasaan hoga
 Ghalib's readers will always recognize Ghalib in an unmistakable manner
 gaalib ke naam se pesh nakli maal ek lamhe ko bhi nahin chalegaa
 But in future when someone will reverse the proceedings of Rajya Sabha and register it in the name of Sher Ghalib, then he will be surprised at both the information of the Prime Minister and the discretion of the Rajya Sabha
 isliye yah jaruri he ki rajyasabha kaa koi saansad, koi netaa, sabhapati is par dhyaan de or sadan kii anumati lekar record se yah sher hataae
 The crisis is that no one will work so hard
 shero-shaayari, kavita-sahitya, kala-samskruti ab ve kshetra nahin hai jin par raajnneeti dhyaan de
 He knows that all these areas are for him to be obliged
 netaa jab apane bhaashanon main kavita kaa istemaal karte hai to jaise kavi upakrit ho jate hai, jab sarkarein lekhakon ko puraskrit karti hai to ve vibhor ho jate hai
 This self-deprivation in the world of literature and culture has probably increased because of the distance between society and culture in recent years
 beshak, iske kuch zimmedaar lekhak or samskruthikarmi rahe hon, lekin zyada zimmedaar vah samaaj he jo badi buree tarah upabhoktavaad ko iklauta mulya maan baitha he
 Social consciousness is a backward thought for him, subtle art, deep music and rich literature are such luxuries for him for which he has no time
 kahani yaa kavita bhi uske liye bas upabhokta saamagree he jiske istemaal kaa ek nishchit samay or upyog he
 This is the reason why he does not feel any deep sense of poetry for himself and the identity of the poet does not matter to him
 is bauddhik shunya main kisi bhi chamakati hui pankti ke istemaal ke liye bhi use koi ek janaa-pahachaanaa naam chahie- vah gaalib kaa ho, bachchan kaa ho yaa phir gulzaar kaa
 The Prime Minister has read Nida Fazli's Ghazal in Parliament before this and has repeated the line of Sarveshwar Dayal Saxena
 bajet pesh karte hue piyush goyal to muktibodh ko uddhrut kar chuke hai
 But whether Nida Fazli or Sarveshwar Dayal Saxena or Muktibodh - no one understands and cares about his poetic consciousness
 bas kahin feet ho sakane vaali pankti chahie jo chun lee gai
 Unfortunately, this time, the lion chosen by the Prime Minister in the Rajya Sabha for his occasion, it is not necessary to confirm whether he is Ghalib or not
 thik he ki unase yah chook ho gai
 But if this lapse is not rectified, Ghalib will not be deterred, but a good opinion will not be formed on the upper house and the supreme person of Indian democracy
 gaalib ne bahut mushkil din dekhe or bahut se virodh jhele
 But he kept his own curse - 'thi khabar garm ki gaalib ke udenge purje See, we also went to the scene
 ' Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh, who returned to the Indian cricket team after about a year, gave a befitting reply to his critics, saying that it could not be 'oneway traffic'
 punjab ko ranjai trophy match main hyderabad par ek pari se jeet dilaane ke baad harbhajan ne kaha, ‘ek achche gendbaaj kaa akalan sirf uske viketon ke aadhaar par nahin hona chaiye
 His bowling skills should also be kept in mind
 ’unhone kaha, ‘spinner kii bhoomika wicket ke anusaar badalati he
 Some people never played cricket by themselves and kept writing unrestrainedly about me
 lekin yah vanave trephic nahin ho saktaa
 'harbhajan said,' i have also seen great spinners Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralitharan not taking wickets in many matches
 main bhi koi jaadugar nahin hum
 i can also have a bad phase
 ’ab tak 98 test main 406 wicket le chuke harbhajan ne kaha ki ek cricketer ke rup main vah paripakv hue hai or apane chayan kii khabar se khush hai
 He said, 'I am happy with the news of selection in Indian Test team
 mere liye yah badi khabar he
 i have played the T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka but the return to the Test team was always in my mind
 ’unhone kaha, ‘100 test khelnaa acchhee uplabdhi hogi
 i want to play a series against England
 ’pichley kuch samay se wicket lene main naakaam rahe harbhajan ne kaha, ‘jab main bhartiya team se baahar tha tab khel ke kai pahaluon par kaam kiya
 i captained Punjab and Mumbai Indians
 ’unhone kaha, ‘ab main acha shrota ban gaya hum or maidan par halaat se behatar tareeke se nipat saktaa hum
 i can take the initiative myself instead of leaving things to the situation
 pichley ek saal main ek cricketer ke taur par paripakv hua hum
 Regarding Indian pitches, he said, "indian wickets should be sporting
 inase chauthe or paanchaven din spinneron ko madad milani chaiye
 He said, "MS Dhoni said that he did not see any off-spinner's ball falling on the batsman's ribs for a long time

 Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, some players of the Indian team had expressed feelings of winning the World Cup for Sachin Tendulkar but former cricketers feel that the team should not divert its attention from it

 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe nahin lagata ki isse dhyaan bantega
 This shows how confident our team is for the win
 sachin mahaan khilaadi he or ve uske sahare apana aatmavishvaas badha rahe hai

 This Indian team is playing

 But before that exit poll results are showing signs of hung assembly
 goa, manipur or meghalaya jaisi galati congress karnataka main nahin doharaana chaahati he
 In the state, the Congress had contested the face of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah but now Siddaramaiah has made the Dalit move
 unhone kaha ki agar koi dalit cheharaa mukhyamantri banataa he to pad chhodane ko taiyaar hai
 In such a situation, there are two faces of Congress in Karnataka, whose name can be stamped
 siddharmaiya ne kaha, 'main dalit ke liye pad chhodane ko taiyaar hum
 If the high command wants, it can make a Dalit a CM
 isamen mujhe koi aapatti nahin he
 With this, Siddaramaiah once again said that this was his last election
 ab wo raajnneeti main to sakriy rahenge lekin chunaav nahin ladenge
 The Siddaramaiah Dalit CMK statement is being speculated in the name of two Congress Dalit faces
 siem ke pramukh daavedaar ke rup main mallikarjun khadge kaa naam he
 Kharge is considered among the stalwarts of the Congress
 iske alaava karnataka main party ke dalit chehre ke saath-saath jamini netaa ke taur par unka naam aata he
 Mallikarjun Kharge was also in the race for CM post in 2013
 lekin party ne unki jagah siddharmaiya ko siem banaaya tha
 After this, Kharge was entrusted with the responsibility of national politics
 bataa den ki mallikarjun khadge svachh chhavi vaale netaa maane jate hai or 9 baar jitkar vidhayak ban chuke hai or duusari baar saansad hai
 He is a leader with long experience in the politics of Karnataka
 aise main dalit siem ke rup main khadge sabase prabal daavedaar maane ja rahe hai
 Siddaramaiah's Dalit CM, statement Paramallikarjun Kharge said, "I have never demanded a chief minister's post as a Dalit leader
" agar unhen mujhako ek netaa ke rup main sweekaar karne main shame aati he, to wo mujhe party kaa varisht kaaryakarta maan len
 If the party considers me worthy of the top post on the basis of seniority, rather than my caste, i welcome it
 unhen dalit siem banaae jane kii sambhaavnaaon par unhone kaha ki har baar is bare main baat karne kaa koi phayda nahin he
 If this happens, it will happen
 khadge ne apratyaksh rup se siem pad ke liye apni daavedaari kii he
 Karnataka Congress state president named as Dalit CM contender
 parameshwar kaa he
 The veteran leaders of the party are considered
 lekin unki raah main sabase badi dikkat siddharmaiya khud hai
 The relationship between the two leaders is not much better
 baavjood iske parameshwar rajya main apni pahchaan ek dalit netaa ke taur par banane main safal rahe hai
 On the statement of Dalit CM, g Parameshwara said that Siddaramaiah's statement is welcome
 main unke is kadam kaa swaagat karata hum
 However, he refused to speak on his davderi
 parameshwar ne kaha ki congress kii parpanra he ki vidhayak dal kii baithak or party ke sheersh netaaon se vichaar-vimarsh ke baad hi siem ke liye nirnay hota he
 Siddaramaiah was also elected last time, who is also CM in waiting in the current assembly elections
 dalit ke liye kyon chhod rahe siem pad?bataa den ki tamaam agsit pole karnataka main trishanku vidhansabha kii ore ishaara kar rahe hai
 In such a situation HD Deve Gowda's party becomes JDS as Kingmaker
 siddharmaiya ke saath jedies kaa chhattis kaa aankada rahaa he
 In such a situation, the JDS will not agree under his name under any circumstances
 jedies ko bijepi ke sang jane se rokane ke lihaaj se siddharmaiya ne khud hi daanv chal diya he
 The Congress can play the Dalit CM card to gain the support of the JDS in the event of a hung assembly
 congress ke is daanv par jedies ko bhi etraj nahin hoga

 Many politicians and analysts of UP are also waiting for the results of the Karnataka assembly elections
 sabaki jigyaasa is baat main he ki agar karnataka main trishanku vidhansabha kii sthiti ai or jedy (es) ne kahin bijepi ko sarkaar banane ke liye samarthan de diya, to kya hoga?yah 2019 main loksabhaa chunaav se pehle upi main espi-bispi ke bich gathjod ke liye ek pariksha sabit ho sakati he
 Especially the Samajwadi Party is eagerly waiting for the results
 asal main zyaadaatar agsit pole yah bataa rahe hai ki karnataka main echdi devgauda kii party janata dal secular kingmekar ban sakati he
 In Karnataka, the JD (S) has tied up with the Bahujan Samaj Party
 to agar jedy (es) ne karnataka main sarkaar banane ke liye bijepi kaa saath diya to is gathbandhan main basapa bhi rah sakati he
 What will happen in the alliance! What will happen in UP, where there is talk of forming an alliance of SP-BSP in 2019 against BJP
 kuch jaankaron kaa to yahi maananaa he ki agar aisa hua to upi main donon partiyon kaa gathbandhan khatai main pad saktaa he
 Till now both SP and BSP have considered themselves as the biggest opponents of BJP
 times of india ke anusaar abhi upi ke diggaj sapa netaaon ko yah bharosa he ki mayawati karnataka main kisi sambhavit bijepi-jedy (es) gathbandhan main shaamil nahin hongi, kyonki isse unhen upi main badi keemat chukaani pad sakati he
 a senior SP leader told the newspaper, 'UP is a stronghold of the BSP and the presence of the party here cannot be compared to Karnataka
 party ko karnataka se itnaa raajnneetik laabh nahin milane vaala ki vah upi kii keemat par vahaan gathbandhan kare
 By the way, JD (S) has also claimed earlier that it will not go with either of the two national parties BJP and Congress
 vaise congress ne sambhavat: jedy (es) ko apane paale main karne ke liye hi dalit siem kaa pasa phenkaa he
 But the CBI has taken a stand on the alleged irregularity in the sale of sugar mills in UP, after which there is no denying that the BSP will join the alliance with the BJP in Karnataka

 Scientists have claimed that mosquitoes that spread malaria have the ability to smell a variety of odors, on the basis of which they detect the presence of humans
 abhi tak yah mana jaataa rahaa tha ki malaria failaane vaale machhar anophylis gambi (maadaa anophylis kii ek prajati) insaanon tak pahunchane ke liye ek hi prakaar ke soonghney kii shakti kaa istemaal karte hai
 Every year nine million people fall asleep to death due to malaria disease caused by this mosquito bite
 jabaki salanaa do karod pachaas lakh log isse sankramit hote he
 In the latest issue of the Public Library of Science Biology, published by a team of researchers from the University of Vanderbitt, it has been reported that mosquitoes also have a second sensory system with smelling ability
 vaigyanikon ke anusaar unke paas praarambhik str par is baat ke saboot he ki machharon ke paas maujuud is soonghney kii shakti vaale samvedi tantra ko agal shrenee main rakhaa ja saktaa he, kyonki yah abhi tak gyaat soonghney kii kshamta vaale samvedi tantra se puri tarah se alag he
 It is said in this research that it is not surprising that mosquitoes have better ability to smell than we think
 soonghney kii shakti kaa hona machharon ke liye behad jaruri he, kyonki agar maadaa machhar khun ko soongh kar chus nahin paayi, to vah prajnan nahin kar paayegi
 This applies to all mosquitoes and not just to the species of Anophilis
 congress kaa maananaa he ki uttar pradesh chunki dilli se sata he isliye vahaan ke log shili dikshit ke 15 saalon ke shashan se waakif hai
 She has a positive image about Sheila's model of development apart from Delhi's metro and flyover
 shila kaa koi apana gut nahin he yahi baat raaj babbar ke liye bhi kahi ja rahi he
 One more thing in Sheila's favor is that she has an image of an educated, elite woman who is also largely unquestioned
 congress kii ranneeti he ki brahman, rajput ,muslim ke alaava gaiyr-jatav voton ko ikattha karnaa
 The Congress has ruled Uttar Pradesh through these votes for 50 years when it was the era of Bahuguna, Kamalapati, Lokpati Tripathi and ND Tiwari
 shila bhi brahman netaa umashankar dikshit kii bahu hai or kannauj se loksabhaa kaa chunaav bhi lard chuki hai
 The Congress strategy is to focus on 120 seats
 inamen aadhe par brahman or baaki par muslim nirnaayak bhoomika main hai
 The comments congress pichley vidhansabha main 29 siton par number ek thi or 31 siton par duusare number par thi
 The Congress feels that it is easy to win these seats and Priyanka Gandhi's role will be important in these seats
 yahi vajah he ki raaj babbar, sanjay singh, shila dikshit kii tikdi ke saath priyanka gandhi ko laakar congress uttar pradesh main kuch kar gujaarna chaahati hai
 The goal of the Congress is to stop the BJP in Uttar Pradesh and bring itself in such a situation that it can become a part of the government in the event of a hung assembly
 kaha yah bhi ja rahaa he ki pichhali baar chunaav main rahul gandhi kii reliyon main khub bheed jamaa hui or cheharaa na hone kii vajah se log puri tarah se voton main badal nahin paae
 This time the party does not want to repeat this mistake
 isliye party ne shila dikshit kaa cheharaa saamne kiya he

 yahi vajah he ki raaj babbar, sanjay singh, shila dikshit kii tikdi ke saath priyanka gandhi ko laakar congress uttar pradesh main kuch kar gujaarna chaahati hai
 The goal of the Congress is to stop the BJP in Uttar Pradesh and bring itself in such a situation that it can become a part of the government in the event of a hung assembly
 kaha yah bhi ja rahaa he ki pichhali baar chunaav main rahul gandhi kii reliyon main khub bheed jamaa hui or cheharaa na hone kii vajah se log puri tarah se voton main badal nahin paae
 This time the party does not want to repeat this mistake
 isliye party ne shila dikshit kaa cheharaa saamne kiya he
 The Congress has ruled Uttar Pradesh through these votes for 50 years when it was the era of Bahuguna, Kamalapati, Lokpati Tripathi and ND Tiwari
 shila bhi brahman netaa umashankar dikshit kii bahu hai or kannauj se loksabhaa kaa chunaav bhi lard chuki hai
 The Congress strategy is to focus on 120 seats
 inamen aadhe par brahman or baaki par muslim nirnaayak bhoomika main hai
 The comments congress pichley vidhansabha main 29 siton par number ek thi or 31 siton par duusare number par thi
 The Congress feels that it is easy to win these seats and Priyanka Gandhi's role will be important in these seats
 yahi vajah he ki raaj babbar, sanjay singh, shila dikshit kii tikdi ke saath priyanka gandhi ko laakar congress uttar pradesh main kuch kar gujaarna chaahati hai
 The goal of the Congress is to stop the BJP in Uttar Pradesh and bring itself in such a situation that it can become a part of the government in the event of a hung assembly
 kaha yah bhi ja rahaa he ki pichhali baar chunaav main rahul gandhi kii reliyon main khub bheed jamaa hui or cheharaa na hone kii vajah se log puri tarah se voton main badal nahin paae
 This time the party does not want to repeat this mistake
 isliye party ne shila dikshit kaa cheharaa saamne kiya he
 The Congress was number one in 29 seats in the last assembly and was second on 31 seats
 congress ko lagata he ki in siton par jeetna aasaan he or inhen siton par priyanka gandhi kii bhoomika ahm hogi
 This is the reason why the Congress wants to do something in Uttar Pradesh by bringing Priyanka Gandhi with the trio of Raj Babbar, Sanjay Singh, Sheila Dixit
 congress kaa lakshya uttar pradesh main bijepi ko rokna he or apane aap ko aise halaat main laana he ki trishanku vidhansabha ke haalat main wo sarkaar kaa hissaa ban sake
 It is also being said that last time there was a huge crowd in Rahul Gandhi's rallies and due to lack of face, people were not able to convert completely into votes
 is baar party is galati ko doharaana nahin chaahati
 That is why the party has exposed Sheila Dixit's face
 kaha yah bhi ja rahaa he ki pichhali baar chunaav main rahul gandhi kii reliyon main khub bheed jamaa hui or cheharaa na hone kii vajah se log puri tarah se voton main badal nahin paae
 This time the party does not want to repeat this mistake
 isliye party ne shila dikshit kaa cheharaa saamne kiya he
 Now i have stopped applying RTI
 jab jawaab hi nahin miltaa to koi kyon apana samay or shram is kaam main lagaae
 On 26 August, the hearing of the Central Information Commission (CIC) in the matter of making the files related to Subhash Chandra Bose public, but kept away from the decision, the old RTI activist Subhash Chandra Aggarwal of Old Delhi, vexed the process
 Said this is artiai ko lekar ve upie sarkaar ke jamaane se sangharsh kar rahe hai, lekin unke hisse us modi sarkaar main bhi taarikh hi aa rahi he, jiske netaa loksabhaa chunaav se pehle netaji se judaa har dastavej saarvajanik kiye jane ko lekar aasmaan sir par uthaa lete the
 Agarwal's second disappointment is also from the Central Government's statement in the Supreme Court in which the government recommended that political parties be kept out of the purview of the Right to Information Act-2005
 siisi ne agarwal kii yachika par hi rajnatik dalon ko artiai ke daayre main laane kaa aadesh diya tha
 Agarwal feels that it is not that the Manmohan Singh government was enthusiastic about responding to RTI, but the new government has a tendency to either not respond to RTI on important topics or to give a rude reply
 desh ke alag-alag ilaakon ke artiai kaaryakartaaon ne bhi india today se isi tarah kii raay jaahir kii
 In response to the reaction on RTI in the central government, RTI activists admitted that the biggest problem was coming from the Prime Minister's Office, Ministry of Home Affairs and Department of Personnel and Training (dopt)
 (dekhen chart)bhopal ke saamaajik kaaryakarta ajay dube ko samaj nahin aa rahaa ki pradhanmantri karyaalay ne 8 july, 2015 kii unki us artiai kaa jawaab dene se kyon manaa kar diya, jisamen yah poocha gaya tha ki vyapam ghotaale ko lekar congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne jo kaagaj pradhanmantri ko saunpe the, un par piemo se jari nirdesh ke dastavej die jaaen
 But the PMO responded in cliched Hindi, "if the information you have asked, collected it will deviate from the sources of the office proportionately
" '' saral bhashaa main kahen to isse piemo ke kaamkaaj par asar padegaa
 Similarly Ramesh Verma of Hisar, who won the National RTI Award in 2010, has not received any response from the Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD) on his RTI application dated 17 July 2015
 verma ne echaradi mantri smriti irani kii shaikshanik yogyata sambandhi praaanpatron kii prati maangi thi
 Similarly, he had asked for a copy of the Prime Minister's educational qualification certificates, then the PMO had sent his application back to the PMO by the Election Commission and the Commission, but he did not get the reply till date
 piemo ne pradhanmantri modi ke sabase priy shagal soshal media ke bare main puche gaye sawaalon kaa bhi kai-kai apilon ke baad aisa hi jawaab diya
 There are many cases where the RTI reply was available till the previous government, but this time information became scarce
 masalan, subhash agarwal kii padam sammaanon se judi filon se judi artiai or verma kii clinical trial se judi artiai kaa jawaab pichhali sarkaar main miltaa rahaa, lekin is baar ye jaankariyaan agamya ho gayi
 The extortion case is related to the file of former AIIMS officer Sanjeev Chaturvedi
 isamen diopiti ne jaankaree na dene ke liye bahaanaa banaaya ki chaturvedi ne file saarvajanik karne se manaa kiya he
 However, at the CIC hearing, Chaturvedi clearly stated that he never did this
 modi raaj main artiai pravritiyon kaa adhyayan karne vaale dilli ke artiai foundation ke adhyaksh or supreme court ke vakil viraag gupta in pravritiyon kii babat kehete hai ki pehla kisi na kisi bahaane se artiai aavedan ko khaarij kar diya jaae
 The second thing is to decentralize the sources of information
 jaise kisi ne mukhyalay se soochna maangi to use baaki daftaron ko bhej dena, iske baad arji dene vaale ke paas alag-alag daftaron se aadhe-adhure jawaab aate rahete hai
 This is exactly what happened in Delhi's Deepak Ranjan's petition on May 28, 2015, about the Prime Minister's expenditure on foreign visits
 piemo ne arji sambandhit karyaalayon ko bhej di or unke paas seychelles or morishas kii yatraaon par 2
 5 crores Rs
 kharch kaa byoraa aayaa
 The details of the remaining visits were not given
 kendriya soochna ayog ke register ne is babat india today ke sawaalon par koi pratikriya nahin di
 But the Commission's figures narrate the story to some extent
 jaise mukhya soochna ayukta ke paas may, 2014 ke ant main jahaan 4,139 maamle lambit the, vahiin 25 agast, 2015 tak yah sankhya badhkar 12,996 ho gai
 The number of pending appeals with the rest of the Information Commissioners has also increased in this proportion
 ayog ke ek adhikari bataate hai, ''lambit maamalon kii fehrist agar dedh saal main kareeb teen guni badi he, to iskaa ek arth yah bhi he ki ab pehle kii tulana main zyada maamle ayog ke paas apil ke liye aa rahe hai
 That is, RTI activists are more dissatisfied than ever with the responses of government information officers
 ''yani artiai ab kai tarah kii nai aghoshit chunautiyon se jujh rahi he
 According to the report of the National Campaign for People's Right to Information (NCPRI), state governments and government institutions have already enacted 118 types of rule codes for the RTI Act
 in samhitaon kaa kaam artiai kaa jawaab hasil karne ko or dushkar bananaa rahaa he
 This unannounced 'no' of the NDA Government has taken this sequence a step ahead

 Holi is celebrated in different ways in different parts of the country, but the city of Kashi, the Holi of Kashi, is totally amazing, unimaginable and unmatched in other places
 aapane rangon se holi to khub kheli hogi, lekin mahadev kii nagari kaashi kii baat hi niraali he
 At the Manikarnika Ghat in Varanasi, Shiva devotees play Holi with the ashes prepared from the ashes of humans who burn in the Mahashamshan
 darasal, phalgun kii ekadshi ko yahaan baba vishwanath kii palki nikalati he or log unke saath rangon kaa tyohar manaate hai
 It is believed that Baba returns the court to Goddess Parvati on that day
 duusare din shankar apane aughad rup main shmashaan ghat par jalati chitaaon ke bich chita-bhasma kii holi khelte he
 The echoes of the Damroos and the cheers of har-har Mahadev and the Akkhad, Alhadbhang, Paan and Thalai devour each other at the Manikarnika Ghat
 yah adbhut drishy hota he
 The belief is that Lord Bholenath gives the mantra of Tarak and taunts all
 logon kii aasthaa he ki mashannath rangabhari ekadshi ke ek din baad khud bhakton ke saath holi khelte he
 This time, the colorful Ekadashi was celebrated on 26 February in Kashi
 maa khelain masane main hori,digambar khelain masane main hori,bhoot pishaach batori,digambar khelain lakhi sundar phaguni chata kii,man se rang gulaal hataa ke ye,chita bhasma bhari jhori,digambar khelain, naachat gaavat damru dhari,choden sarp garal pichakaari,pitain pret thapori, digambar khelain masane main hori
 
 bhakton sang mahadev khelte hai holikashi main mahadev ne naa sirf apane puure kunbe ke saath vaas kiya balki har utsavon main yahaan ke logon ke saath mahadev ne baraabar kii hissedari kii
 Especially the tradition of Holi played by the devotees in Falgun is still alive today but the tradition of the people of Kashi devouring each other amidst the echoes of Damru and the slogans of Har Har Mahadev
 bhootnath kii mangal hori,dekhi sihaayen biraj kii chhoric,dhan-dhan nath aghori,digambar khelain masane main hori
 
 chita kii bhasma se kheli jaati he holipuranic manyataon ke mutabik, kaashi ke manikarnika ghat par shiv ne moksh pradaan karne kii pratigya lee thi
 Kashi is the only city in the world where man's death is also considered to be Mars
 manyata he ki rangabhari ekadshi ekadshi ke din mata parvati kaa gauna karaane baad devgan evam bhakton ke saath baba holi khelte hai
 But ghosts, vampires etc
 creatures do not play with them
 isiilie agle din baba manikarnika tirth par snaan karne aate hai or apane ganon ke saath chita bhasma se holi khelte hai
 In Neg, Kashi residents are allowed Holi and Hudang
 kaashivishwanath kaa adbhangi rupbhaavon se hi prasann ho jane vaale aughaddani kii is lila ko har saal puri kii jaati he
 a chirp from Abir Gulal also spreads a different tone in the eerie atmosphere echoing amidst the pyre of Chita Bhasma

 Holi without cannabis is considered incomplete and Banarasi Holi without cold is considered incomplete
 yahaan bhaang ko shivaji kaa prasad maanate hai
 They make special arrangements of cannabis here on Holi
 tamaam tarah kii thandai ghoti jaati he, jinamein kesar, pista, baadaam, maghai paan, gulab, chameli, bhaang kii thandai kaaphi prasiddh he
 When the residents of Kashi sing sweetly on the sweetness of cannabis and coolness and the beat of drums, no one around them can live without joining

 It is alleged that Ranju was pressurizing Ramesh to leave his wife and keep her with him
 ramesh ne jabamahila kii baat nahin maani, tab somvaar kii shaam ranju ne bahala phusalaakar ramesh ko apane ghar bulaayaa or pyaar se baaten karne lagi
 Meanwhile, he cut Ramesh's private part with a sharp weapon

 The genie of pride in the Samajwadi Party and family already running before the Uttar Pradesh elections may once again come out of its bottle
 sapa sangrakshak mulaayam singh yadav kii duusari patni or mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kii sauteli maa sadhana yadav ne bayaan diya he ki vah ab frontroot par kaam karengi or khul kar apana paksh rakhengi
 This statement can once again intensify the war in the SP family
 kya hai bayaan ke myne?chunaavon se pehle yah kaha ja rahaa tha ki akhilesh hameshaa se hi sadhana yadav, pratik yadav va aparnaa yadav kaa raajnneeti main aane par virodh karte rahe hai
 This was one of the main reasons for the quarrel in the SP family
 lekinmulaayam singh yadav, shivpal singh yadavake dabaav main akhilesh yadav ko aparnaa yadav ko tikat dena padaa tha, aparnaa yadav ne lakhanu kaint se chunaav ladaa he
 If symbol also comes politics, then once again Akhilesh's opposition may increase
 pratik aae raajnneeti main to !sadhana ne apane bayaan main kaha ki vah chaahati hai ki pratik yadav raajnneeti main aaen
 Significantly, Prateek has so far stayed away from politics, he has been giving more attention to his gym
 ek ore jahaan aparnaa yadav vidhansabha kaa chunaav ladakar rajya kii raajnneeti main aa gai hai, to vahiin sadhana yadav pratik yadav ko bhi raajnneeti main laakar apane parivaar ke dakhal ko ore badhanaa chaahati hai
 Will Sapati accept Prateik? Prateek Yadav is the son of Mulayam Singh Yadav's second wife Sadhana Yadav
 agar pratik raajnneeti main aate hai, to sabase bada sawaal yah khadaa hoga ki kya samaajawaadee party or mulaayam singh yadav ke samarthak akhilesh yadav kii tarah hi unhen sweekaar karenge
 The sps have given Akhilesh a place in their hearts, but will the symbol of support be available to him as well
 pratik kabhi bhi kisi raajnneetik kaarykram main dikhaai nahin die hai
 Supporting Shivpal, targeting Ram Gopal! Sadhana Gupta has supported Shivpal Yadav in his statement
 unka kahana he ki is puure jhagade main shivpal kii galati nahin he
 This clearly shows that if Sadhana Gupta's dominance in the party increases in the future, then once again the same credibility of Shivpal Yadav will return to that of Mulayam Singh Yadav
 sadhana kaa yah kahana ki akhilesh ko gumraah kiya gaya he, saaf he ki unka nishaanaa ramgopal yadav kii ore he
 Ram Gopal Yadav has been with Akhilesh continuously during the quarrel, he was also expelled from the party several times
 ramgopal ne hi rashtriya sammelan bulaakar chunaav se pahalokhilesh yadavako sapa kaa rashtriya adhyaksh banwaaya tha
 Mother-in-law adopted daughter-in-law! Sadhana Yadav says that she will start social work and help people
 isse pehle unki bahu aparnaa yadav ne bhi raajnneeti main entry se pehle samajaseva ke kshetra main apni pahchaan banaai thi or uske baad ab vah chunavi maidan main ain hai
 It is clear that Sadhana Yadav, like her daughter-in-law, first wants to present herself as a face, then wants to enter politics

 Shahid Badar Falahi is a doctor by profession and was the chairman of SIMI till the ban on the Student Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) on 27 September 2001
 simi par pratibandh ke turant baad unhen aatanki sargana bataate hue giraftaar kar liya gaya
 a total of eight cases were registered against him
 inamen se chaar maamalon main bari ho chuke falahi ko agast 2004 main jail se reeha kar diya gaya
 Prominent correspondent Piyush Babilene spoke to Simi and IM about their relationship
 kya jihad simi kii vichaardhaara kaa abhinn hissaa he? kya aapako bharat ke kanoon or samvidhan par bharosa he
 The basic concept of SIMI is "organization of students, by students, for social service
 '' pratibandh lagane tak simi ke desh bhar main 400 ansaar (purnakalik sadsy) or 20,000 iswan (asthaayee sadsy) the
 Jihad is an integral part of SIMI ideology
 lekin jihad kaa matlab vah nahin he jo oxford kaa shabdkosh or america agenciyaan thopati he
 Jihad means the relentless attempt to eliminate evil from the ground
 rahi baat samvidhan par bharose kii to ham aaj tak simi par lagaae gaye chaaron pratibandhon ke khilaaf supreme court main maamla lard rahe hai
 The legal battle proves that we trust the Constitution
 lekin lagaataar aarope lag rahe hai ki pratibandh ke baad simi ke logon ne iem banaaya
 How are you claiming that SIMI was just a student organization
 aap bataaie ki indian mujahidin koun he? iskaa sadr koun he or kahaan iskaa mukhyalay he? is par lage pratibandh ko adaalat main kisne chunauti di? har sanghathan kaa dhaancha hota he, lekin iem ke bare main theory ke alaava kuch saamne nahin aayaa
 Actually, IM is nothing but the creation of IB (intelligence Bureau)
 ibi logon ke dimag main do or do paanch kaa tark bharna chaahati he, jo baat logon ke gale nahin utarati or isile iem kii koi shakl saamne nahin aa paa rahi
 Even after the attack on the Delhi High Court, the name of IM has been matched
 aise main aap iem ko kaise nakaar sakate hai
 i strongly condemn all the terrorist attacks in Delhi High Court or earlier
 in hamalon ke gunahagaaron ko kadi sajaa di jaae
 As far as the allegations on SIMI are concerned, many of our people are in jail and the police can extract all the information from them in reverse leg
 lekin lambey samay se jail main band hone ke baavjood vahaan se kuch nahin nikal rahaa he
 One of our comrades is Abu Bashar Kashmi, poor poor man
 lekin unhen july 2008 ke ahmedabad bam dhamaakon kaa master mind bataakar giraftaar kar liya gaya
 As long as he stayed with us, we considered him as half-mind, but after arrest he became master mind
 aise tamaam maamle aap ko mil jaaenge
 And to investigate the blasts, Hindu fundamentalist organizations should also be monitored
 aise maamalon main faraar logon kii giraftaar ho
 Your point is that religious bias is being done in the investigation of terrorism? i am just saying that investigation should be done with an independent mind
 kanoon apni jagah he lekin rajnatik partiyon kii manshaa saaf nahin he
 In today's situation we do not find any difference between Congress and RSS
 donon musalamaanon ke khilaaf hai
 But ordinary Hindus are not like this
 azamgarh or manachobha gaanv ke mere clinics par aaj bhi har jati-dharm ke marij aate hai
 The common man has to identify the truth and falsehood
 purv kendriya grahamantri or jammu kashmir kii pipuls democratic party (pidipi) ke varisht netaa mufti mohammad said ne neshnal conference ke baad ab congress ko bhi khuli chunauti di he
 Annoyed by Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice President Rahul Gandhi, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed is the first leader to announce that Yashpal Sharma will be the PDP candidate from jammu-poonch parliamentary seat
 yashpal sharma ko haal hi main party ne vidhanparishad kaa sadsy banaaya he
 Yashpal Sharma is popular among all sections of society due to his secular image
 jammu kashmir pradesh congress ke 1975 se 1987 tak rahe adhyaksh mufti mohammad ko kendriya congressi netaaon se kaaphi thes pahunchi he
 Due to this, he has now opened a front against the Congress, which has put the jammu-poonch parliamentary seat, which was always in the account of the Congress, in danger
 pichley loksabhaa chunaavon main amarnath andolan ke dauraan bhi congress ummidavaar madan laal sharma bijepi ummidavaar or andolan ke sanyojak lila karn sharma se 1,21,373 voton se jite the jabaki pidipi ke ummidavaar trilok singh bajva ko 9,3730 or bispi ke ummidavaar hossain ali ko 49988 vot mili the
 Sources say that Mufti Mohammed has shot two birds with one stone this time by declaring Yashpal Sharma as pdp's candidate from jammu-poonch parliamentary seat
 ek to vah congrence se loksabhaa seat chin sakate hai or doosraa congress ko target kar sakate hai, jisase congress unase dobaaraa baatcheet shuru kar sakati he or jammu kashmir main november 2014 main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main pidipi-congress najadik aa sakati hai

 In a meeting with Vijay Goel, Manmohan Singh welcomed his efforts and said that the government which has started efforts to get in touch is welcome
 sadan ko sucharu rup se chalaane kii jimmedaari sattadhari or vipaksh donon kii he
 Vijay Goel told Manmohan Singh that there are 68 mlas pending in Lok Sabha and 40 in Rajya Sabha, so the cooperation of all parties is necessary to pass important bills keeping in mind the interest of the country in the monsoon session starting from July 18
 vijay goyal ne kaha ki vah monsoon satr shuru hone se pehle duusare vipakshi netaaon se bhi milenge or chah mahatvapurn adhyadeshon ko paarit karwaane ke liye sahyog maangenge
 Vijay Goel said that it is necessary to pass the Muslim Marriage, Motor Vehicles Bill Amendment 2017 and Prevention of Corruption Bill 2013 in the interest of the country
 vipakshi party kaa sahyog milanaa chahie tabhi yah bill paas honge
 The BJP MP said that no work was done in the last budget session
 rajyasabha main keval 8% or loksabhaa main keval 4% kaamkaaj hua, lekin monsoon satr main ummid he ki sadan sucharu rup se chal paaegaa
 The Monsoon Session of Parliament from 18 July, the Monsoon Session starting from 18 July will run till 10 August
 bataa den ki bajet satr puri tarah se vipaksh ke hangaame ke kaaran dhul gaya tha, jiske kaaran kai mahatvapurn bill paas nahin ho paae the
 In the budget session, there was a lot of uproar by the opposition on many other issues including the prices of petrol and diesel, special category status to Andhra Pradesh

 The leader should have the right to choose the team
 ' Margaret Alva, a close family member of the Gandhi family, who held positions like Union Minister, Congress Party General Secretary, MP and Governor, has returned to active politics once again
 ji haa, party adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne karnataka chunaav ke liye banaai pradesh ellection cameti main varisht or anbhavi netaa margaret alva ko bhi jagah di he
 This committee will select the candidates at the state level in Karnataka, whose list will be looked at first at the central level by the scrutiny committee and then later by the party's central election committee
 2008 main hui sakriy raajnneeti se vidaivaise dilachasp he ki, ek dashak pehle 2008 main karnataka vidhansabha chunaav ke vaqt hi margaret alva kii vivaad ke chalate sakriy raajnneeti se vidaai ho gai thi
 At that time, Margaret Alva was considered the party's domineering general secretary, who was earlier the general secretary in charge of Maharashtra under a strong Chief Minister like Vilasrao Deshmukh, then Haryana as Bhupinder Singh Hooda's CM
 us vaqt kaha jaataa tha ki, alva kisi ke dabaav main nahin aati thim
 Also, Alva was not accused of any kind of corruption at that time
 sonia ke alaava kisi kaa hastkshep bardaasht nahinkehate hai ki, alva party main sirf or sirf tatkaaleen party adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke alaava kisi kaa hastkshep bardaasht nahin karti thim
 Ekla used to do the politics of Chalo away from any kind of lobby within the party
 isliye alva ko sonia gandhi bhi khaasi pasand karti thim or unako mahatvapurn rajyon kaa prabhaar saunpti thim
 In the 2008 elections, the assembly sought ticket for the son
 Like many other leaders at the time of Karnataka assembly election 2008, Margaret was seeking assembly ticket for her son, but then the Karnataka general secretary in-charge Prithviraj Chavan and the ticket-sharing screening committee Alva's son could not get a ticket due to the rules of the head of Digvijay Singh
 margaret us vaqt maan rahi thim ki, ab unako to chunaav ladanaa nahin, to bete ko de diya jaay
 At the same time, the rule was made that, no leader's brother, wife or son will be given a ticket
 haa, agar koi khud nahin ladakar apni sitting seat par tikat chaahe to mil jayega
 By this rule many elderly leaders themselves cleared the way for their own people, but Margaret missed out on not being a sitting MLA
 margaret khun kaa ghunt pikar rah gayi
 But in 2008, a few months after the elections in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh came, the children and families of about a dozen leaders in both states got tickets
 party main niyam ek rajya ke liye nahin puure desh ke liebus, isi baat se bhadakin alva ne kaha ki, party main niyam ek rajya ke liye nahin puure desh ke liye hona chahie
 After this, the then General Secretary Alva proceeded further and alleged that Congress Party tickets were sold in the Karnataka Assembly elections
 bina naam liye alva ne digvijay or chavaan samet puri congress ko katghare main khadaa kar diya
 After this, due to the stir, Alva had to resign from the post of party general secretary
 rajya or centre kii raajnneeti main ekadam kinare ho gayi
 Later, during UPA-2, it was indicated that by making her governor, she has now moved away from active politics
 raajnneeti main paidaa kii halchalrajyapal pad se hatane ke baad alva sakriy raajnneeti main bilkul haashiye par thim, unke virdohi hi nahin samarthak bhi maan rahe the ki, alva ab ritair hone kaa aadhikarik elaan hi karengi
 But once again Alva has made a comeback with Rahul's pen due to his relationship with the Gandhi family and his impeccable image
 alva kii sakriy raajnneeti main vaapasi ne karnataka main kam se kam congress ke bheetar kii raajnneeti main to halchal paidaa kar di he

 Taking a dig at the bjp's internal discord, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav claimed that a stampede situation has arisen among BJP leaders over fear of bjp's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi
 khagadiya, bhagalpur or baankaa main chunavi sabhaaon ko sambodhit karne ke liye patna se ravaanaa hone ke purv patrakaron se baatcheet karte hue lalu ne kaha ki modi ne apni party ke varisht netaaon ko itnaa bhaybheet kar diya he ki apane sammaan kii raksha main bijepi chhodane ko lekar unke bich bhagdad si sthiti utpann ho gai he
 Lalu pointed to the dissatisfaction of senior BJP leaders - including LK Advani, Murali Manohar Joshi, Jaswant Singh, Lalmuni Choubey and Chandramohan Roy - over the party's ticket distribution
 jaswant singh or lalamuni choube pehle hi kramash: rajasthan ke barmed or bihar ke baxur loksabhaa seat se nirdaleey pratyaashee ke taur par namakan daakhil kar chuke hai
 Lalu claimed that there was a wave in favor of UPA in other parts of the country including Bihar and said that these communal forces fighting among themselves will be ruined
 apni party argedy kii tarif karte hue lalu ne kaha ki sabhi dalon ke ghar main aag lagi hui he, par unki party ke sabhi log shantipurvak janata ke liye kaam kar rahe hai

 unhone argedy ke pratyaashee alok kumaar verma ko haraaya tha
 Ashwamedha Devi got 180082 votes while Mehta got 154770 votes
 ujiyarpur loksabhaa kshetra arakshit nahin he or yah general catagori main aata he
 One special thing with Ujiarpur is that BJP candidate Nityanand Rai, who won from here in 2014, is also currently the president of Bihar BJP
 pradesh main yadav vot par nigaah rakhte hue party alaakaman ne unhen yah ahm jimmedaari saunpi thi
 Rai was made the chairman, keeping an eye on Lalu Yadav's good hold in Bihar

 How to turn in favor of Rai In the 2014 elections, Narendra Modi rallied in favor of Nityanand Rai and openly praised his actions
 puure desh main modi lahar kaayam thi, lihaaja raay aasaani se jeet gaye
 The drawback with JDU candidate Ashwamedh Devi was that he ignored irrigation related works in his own constituency, which have been a major influence in the last several elections
 2014 ke chunaav main jediu samarthak nitish kumaar ke kaam se khush the lekin ve loksabhaa main jediu pratyaashee ko nahin bhejnaa chaahate the
 The result was that Ashwamedh Devi lost the election and bjp's Nityananda Rai was declared victorious

 ballebaaji main kharaab shuruyaat ke baavjood england par sabase badi jeet darj karne se utsahit bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne jeet kaa shrey puri team ko diya, lekin spinner ravichandran aswin or ravinder jadeja kii vishesh tarif kii, jinhone unhen ‘galat sabit’ kiya
 Dhoni said after India's 127-run win in the second ODI, each performed well
 hamaari shuruyaat acchhee nahin rahi
 The openers had problems, but Yuvraj and Virat Kohli set the stage for us
 unhone kaha, yah aisa wicket lag rahaa tha, jo sapaat ho saktaa he
 We thought it would dry up and the spinners would not get much more turn
 acha he ki main galat sabit hua or hamaare spinneron ko turn mila
 Jadeja and Ashwin took five wickets together and played an important role in giving India a big win
 dhoni ne toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji ke faisle ko sahi tehraaya
 He said, it was important to pass that time initially when the fast bowlers were getting a little help from it
 yah aisa wicket nahin tha, jis par toss jitkar aap pehle kshetrarakshan kaa faisla karo
 The responsibility was for the batsmen
 bhartiya captain ne kaha ki ek samay unhone 250 ran ke kareeb lakshya dene ke bare main sochaa tha
 "initially, when me and Raina were playing, we were thinking of reaching 240 or 250 runs," he said
 iske baad jab ham jam gaye to ham 260 kaa lakshya dene ke bare main sochane lage
 We scored 15 runs more
 tippaniyan Dhoni said, i believe this wicket was ideal for a Test match
 isse tej gendbaaj bhi phayda uthaate tathaa spinneron ke liye bhi turn tha jaisaa ki ham chaahate the
 The next match between India and England will be played on January 19 in Ranchi, Dhoni's hometown and the Indian captain is very excited about it
 dhoni ne kaha, aglaa match mere shahar main hoga or vah bahut khaas hoga
 The audience here was truly unmatched, but the heat and humidity here can not be forgotten
 kerala ke tej gendbaaj es srisanth ne kal a5yaas ke dauraan gendbaaji kii
 Dhoni said, "it's good that Sreesanth is fit
" jadeja or aswin ne milakar paanch wicket liye or bharat ko badi jeet dilaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Dhoni won the toss and justified the decision to bat first
 unhone kaha, jab shuru main tej gendbaajon ko isse thodaa madad mil rahi thi tab vah samay gujaarna mahatvapurn tha
 It was not a wicket on which you decide to field first by winning the toss
 jimmedaari ballebaajon kii thi
 The Indian captain said that at one time he thought of giving a target closer to 250 runs
 unhone kaha, shuru main jab main or raina khel rahe the ham 240 yaa 250 ran tak pahunchane ke bare main soch rahe the
 After that, when we froze, we started thinking of giving a target of 260
 hamane 15 ran adhik banaae
 The comments dhoni ne kaha, meraa maananaa he ki yah wicket test match ke liye adarsh tha
 This would also benefit the fast bowlers and turn for the spinners as we wanted
 bharat or england ke bich aglaa match 19 janvari ko dhoni ke grihnagar ranchi main khelaa jayega or bhartiya captain isse kaaphi utsahit hai
 Dhoni said, the next match will be in my city and that will be very special

 DMK MP Tiruchi Siva took up the case of widows of Vrindavan in the Rajya Sabha on Friday
 tamilnadu nivasee saansad shiva ne kaha ki ek saal pehle bhi maine sarkaar kaa dhyaan vrundavan main vidhwaaon kii sthiti kii ore khinchaa tha, lekin is par kuch thos kadam nahin uthaaya gaya
 He said, 'even though i come from Tamil Nadu, but all Indians are our siblings, that's why i am raising the issue of the pitiable condition of widows here in Vrindavan, Uttar Pradesh
 'shiva ne kaha ki vrundavan main ek lakh se zyada vidhwaaen hai
 There are no adequate arrangements for their stay
 unke khaane ke liye uchit intjaam nahin hai, awaas kii vyavastha nahin he, unhen majaboor hokarsadakon par bheekh maangane ke liye chhod diyagaya he
 7 out of the total female population of our country
 37 fisadi vidhwaaen hai
 It has the highest percentage of widows in the female population worldwide
 unhone kaha, 'bharat main kareeb 4 karod 32 lakh 61 hajaar 278 vidhwaaen hai
 It can be said that the population of India is high, so the population of widows is also high here, but nowhere is the pathetic condition like our country
 'shiva ne kaha ki yah kisi dal kaa mudda nahin he, yah maanavtaa kii baat he
 There are widows ranging from 20 years to 70 years
 keval hamaare yahaan hi vidhwaa hone ke saath saamaajik kalank bhi aata he
 It does not come with men
 isliye vidhwaaon kaa jivan ant tak dayaneey bana rahata he
 He said that whenever a woman becomes a widow in West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, it is left to her
 kuch enjio unhen aashray dete hai or unhen aath rupee pratidin gujaarey ke liye die jate hai
 He said that this is the case not only in Vrindavan but in the whole country
 haal hi main hamane apana netaa (em karunanidhi) khoyaa he or yah unke prati sachhee shradhanjali hogi ki ham periyar ke anuyaayi banate hue vidhwaaon kii behatari ke liye kaam karen, thos kadam uthaaen
 Siva said that after the death of her husband, widowed women are not allowed to go to many places
 hamaare yahaan jati vyavastha he, mahilaon ke saath bhi bhedbhaav hota he
 We should adopt a scientific approach, which is enshrined in the Constitution
 diemke saansad ne poocha ki ham 21veen sadi main rah rahe hai, ham daawa karte hai ki ham duniya ke sabase bade loktantr main hai to duusari ore hamaari mahilaayein aisi sthiti main hai
 If the government does not take responsibility for it, then who else will take it? They said that most of the widowed women are older, they are not literate, they cannot go to court and fight for their rights
 sarkaar ko inaki behatari ke liye aage aana hoga
 The Central Government has no other scheme for their benefit other than some schemes like Indira Gandhi Widow Pension Scheme
 unhone tamilnadu main mahilaon ke hiton ke liye uthaae gaye kadamon kaa bhi zikr kiya or periyar, annadurai, karunanidhi or dravid andolan ko iskaa shrey diya
 He appealed to the central government to take a serious stand on the matter
 unhone kaha ki vidhwaaon ko aarthik, saamaajik, kanoonee or swasthya sambandhi pareshaaniyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 SP and Congress mps also supported Samajwadi Party's Uttar Pradesh MP Ravi Prakash said that the situation of widowed women is worse than animals and it is our shameful face that we are treating our elders like this
 hamaare yahaan jinda rahane ke liye kaam karnaa jaruri he
 One can earn four paise through hard work, but cannot come in a respectable position
 gujarat se congress kii rajyasabha saansad ami yagnik ne kaha ki tiruchi shiva ne bhartiya samaaj kii sachai bataai he
 Yes, there are four crore widows in India and their pathetic condition is frightening
 unhone kaha ki in mahilaon kaa swasthya kaa mudda or aarthik nirbharta ko ab tak nahin suljhaayaa gaya he
 The next session till date was 'dharma or Business'
 baatcheet ke liye saamne the mashhoor yoga guru baba ramdev, dharmaguru chidanand muni or sarvanand saraswati
 On this occasion Baba Ramdev also responded to the allegations of doing business in the name of Yoga and Ayurveda
 unhone kaha ki unke paas na to bank acount he or na hi ek rupee kii bachat
 He said that no matter how many cases the government may do, the truth is that i do not have a piece of land
 baba ramdev bole ki mujhe to bhakton ne lakhon acre jameen or tapu dene kaa prastaav diya tha
 Had it been accepted, the media would have created a ruckus
 apane kaarobaar par ramdev bole ki maine arabon kaa munafa kamaane vaali multi neshnal cosmetics or peya padaarth companiyon kii dukaane band karwaani shuru kar deen
 So all these things are happening
 unhone kaha ki pehle log jin padaarthon ke liye hajaaron rupee dete the
 Now the same Patanjali Yoga Peeth offers a few hundred rupees
 ramdev ne poocha ki is tarah kaa kaam dhandha kaise ho saktaa he
 Chancellor of Sripeetham, Sarwanand Saraswati, who came to this session, said that many Guru Ghantals have been born in the name of Baba in this country
 unhone kaha ki baba naam judate hi kaarobaar shuru ho jaataa he
 Questioning the fanatics of the religious leaders, Sarbananda said that every Baba Five Star Hotel is engaged in building the Numa Ashram
 videsh yatra karnaa chahta he
 Wants to gather things of enjoyment
 unhone kaha ki ye guru ghantal bacchon se ye nahin kehete ki apane maa-baap kii puja karo
 To do our worship
 apni photo taangane kii naseehat dete hai
 Baba Ramdev, while listening to this sermon, started explaining some definitions of religion while reciting some verses and said that take out the unscrupulous, whether he is sitting in a temple, in a mosque or in Parliament
 bahes main shaamil hote parmarth niketan ke chidanand maharaj bolte ki dhandha vah he, jo sirf apane liye sochataa he or dharm vah he, jo sabake liye sochataa he
 Chidananda gave the example of an auto
 jisaki gaadi ke peeche likhaa tha
 God bless everyone
 shuruyaat mujhase karo
 Chidanand said that this is the condition of religion today
 pehle meraa dhandha durust ho jaae
 On the question of cleaning the religion before politics, Sarvanand Saraswati said that the religious leaders are so merry in getting their chakri that their mouth does not seem to be clean
 ant main chidanand saraswati bole ki agar kabhi kisi ko kisi dharm se jude vyakti se shikaayat hoti he, to use dhyaan rakhana chahie ki yah vyakti kaa masalaa he, use puure dharm se na joda jaae
 Baba Ramdev supported his point and said that religion has never been individualistic
 baba ramdev ne chalate chalate doharaaya ki narendra modi main madda he ki vah desh kii bagdor sambhaal saken

 Uranium worth $ 40 million will be supplied
 bharat ke parmaanu kaarykram ko lekar kareeb chaar dashak pehle is kshetra main dwipaksheeya sambandh khatm ho gaye the
 The uranium supply agreement was signed after a long civilian nuclear agreement signed in 2013 after long negotiations between India and Canada, which was signed after extensive talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Canadian counterpart Stephen Harper
 ek sheersh adhikari ne bataaya ki chemico corporation bharat ko agle paanch saalon main teen hajaar metric ton uranium kii aapurti karegaa, jisaki anumaanit keemat 25
 4 million dollars
 rus or kazakhstan ke baad canada teesraa desh he, jo bharat ko uranium kii aapurti karegaa
 The supplies will be under the safety standards of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
 canada ne 1970 ke dashak main bharat ko uranium or parmaanu hardware niryaat par pratibandh laga diya tha
 Canada had banned uranium exports, alleging that India used Canadian technology to make nuclear bombs
 donon deshon ne 2013 main canada-bharat parmaanu sahyog samjhauta karke is adhyay ko peeche chhod diya tha
 "canada has decided to provide uranium to India for the next five years," Harper said at a joint press conference with Modi
 narendra modi pichley 42 saalon main bharat ke pehle pradhanmantri hai, jo canada ke daure par aae hai
 Modi said, the agreement to purchase uranium from Canada for our civil nuclear power plants is the beginning of a new era in bilateral relations and this new level of mutual trust

 This time Holi of Chidambaram's son Karti Chidambaram will be in jail
 court ne holi se ek din pehle unhen 5 din ke liye sibiai kii hiraasat main bhejne kaa aadesh de diya he
 The CBI produced Karti on Thursday in Patiala House Court, where he demanded the court to send Karti on 14 days remand, on which the court remanded him to CBI custody till 6 March
 isi din unhen phir se court main pesh hona hoga
 Also, the court has allowed Karti's lawyer that he can meet her for 2 hours a day
 ek ghanta subah or ek ghanta shaam ko mulaakaat kii ja sakati he
 They can be given essential medicines, but will not be allowed to eat homemade food
 court kii ore sibiai remand main bheje jane ke baad karti ne kaha ki vah doshamukt sabit honge
 However, during arguments in court, Karthi's lawyer made several strong arguments and his lawyer called the CBI as Kumbhakarna
 unhone vyangy lahaze main kaha ki kumbhakarna bhi 6 maheene main ek baar jaagta he, jabaki is jaanch agency ne 6 maheene pehle kii gai poochtacha ke baad ek din achaanak karti ko giraftaar kar liya
 Karthi's medical checkup On the other hand, the cbi's argument for remand was that Karthi and the other accused should be questioned face to face and hence their remand should be extended
 sibiai guuruuvaar subah se hi karti se poochtacha kar rahi thi
 His medical checkup has also been done
 sibiai ne sunwaayee ke dauraan karti or unke sie bhaskaran ko jamaanat dene kaa virodh kiya
 The CBI said that all the evidence is against them, we have strong evidence of their transaction
 agar jamaanat di gai to cese prabhavit hoga
 Tushar Mehta said that this is not the political vendetta but the result of the CBI investigation so far
 court main karti kii maa nalini chidambaram or pita pi
 Chidambaram was also present
 sunwaayee ke dauraan karti ke sie ne kaha ki abhi tak kisi paison kii len-dein kaa pataa nahin chalaa he
 There is only 10 lakh rupees in doubt
 jo aarope lagaae ja rahe hai ki maine kisi saman kaa jawaab nahin diya he vah galat he
 Advocating the CBI during the hearing, Tushar Mehta said that Karthi did not tell him that he had chest pain, despite that he was kept in care till 7 am
 subah 8 baje vah sibiai ke paas pahunche, sibiai sirf 10 baje ke baad poochtacha kar sakati thi
 The CBI demands that Karti be interrogated along with the other accused, so they should not be granted bail

 On Wednesday, Karthi was remanded to one day Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) custody
 guuruuvaar ko hi grih mantri rajnath singh ne kaha ki sibiai ek vishwasaneey jaanch agency he, vah apana kaam kar rahi he
 Karthi was arrested from Chennai Airport on Wednesday morning
 iske baad dilli laakar sibiai ne poochtacha kii or phir patiala house court main pesh kiya
 Metropolitan Magistrate Sumit Anand remanded Karti to CBI custody till 12:30 pm on Thursday, when regular CBI judges would hear the matter and consider seeking agency's 15-day custody of Karti for detailed investigation
 
 sibiai ke vakil ne dandadhikari se kaha ki unhen karti se vistrut poochtacha kii jarurat he kyonki vah jaanch main sahyog nahin kar rahe hai or lagaataar videsh ja rahe hai
 Rejecting the cbi's claim, senior advocate and Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said that both the allegations are false
 karti sibiai or idi ke samaksh kul milakar 30-40 ghante tak pesh hue hai or jaanch main sahyog kiya he
 Singhvi said that after August 28 last year, the CBI has not issued any summons and whenever he has gone abroad, he has taken permission from the court
 unhone karti dwaara sabooton ke saath sambhavit chhedchhad ke aarope ko bhi khaarij kar diya
 He said that this is a 10-year-old case based on documents and there is no question of tampering with it

 CBI Based Custody for Custody CBI will tell the court for Custi's custody how Karti had helped Indrani Mukherjee and her husband Peter Mukherjee's company INX Media to get foreign funds
 sibiai kaa kahana he ki exipibi ne 2007 main ienex ke 305 karod rupee kaa videshi fund lene par roak laga di thi or keval 5 karod rupee hasil karne kii hi ijaajat mili thi

 On the first day of Navaratri in the country, the worship of Goddess Shailputri as the first form of Mother Durga, begins on Thursday, September 21, the nine holy days of Navaratri
 duniyabar main manaae jane vaale navaratri main lakhon log maa durga ke naam par vrath rakhte hai, lekin vrath ke chakkar main aksar log apana swasthya bhi kharaab kar baithte hai
 In such a situation, if you adopt these seven easy tips before fasting, then you will never have to face any kind of problem in keeping the fast

 1
 He kept taking small meals from time to time
 agar aap kuch ghanton ke antaraal main vrath ke samay par choti-choti miles lete hai to isse aapke sharir kaa blad glucose level sthir rahegaa or aap thakaa hua mahasoos nahin karenge
 2
 aapako apane sharir main pani kii maatra kaa vishesh rup se dhyaan rakhana hoga
 More and more water should be drunk during the fast
 saath hi sharir main pani kii kami ko puraa karne ke liye nariyal pani, neembu pani, green tii or chacha kaa bhi seven kiya ja saktaa he
 3
 vrath ke dauraan sharir main energy banaae rakhane ke liye aapako corbehydrates kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana hoga
 For this, you can also eat potato, tomato, ghee, sitaphal and sabudana
 4
 To get rid of weakness in fasting, consuming kuttu is considered the best option
 kuttu main 70-75 fisadi carbo or 20-25 fisadi protein maujuud hota he
 5
 iske alaava vrath main saamak chaaval bhi kha sakate hai
 This rice is considered good in terms of digestion because it does not require much hard to digest and it digests soon
 6
 As a snack, you should not rely too much on packets of snacks during the fast
 isaki bajaae agar aap vrath vaale chips, fruit chaat yaa khire kaa raita khaane ke taur par lete hai to vah aapke liye zyada phydemand sabit hoga
 7
 vrath ke samay par aap fruit shakes bhi pi sakate hai
 With this, you will get many things like energy, protein, carbs easily
 8
 During the fast, we should also avoid fried things (baked chips, roasted peanuts)
 isaki jagah ham roasted makhane or dry fruits kha sakate hai
 The comments 9
 If you feel like eating too much during fast, you can fulfill your desire to eat sweet by consuming jaggery and honey
 10
 Apart from this, you should also not drink full cream milk during the fast
 iske bajaae aapako tone milk pinaa chahie kyonki isamen phul kriim ke mukaable kam fat hota he
