 On the occasion of completion of two years of the Modi government, the Congress is busy in besieging the government
 party kaa bade netaa is maukey par aankadon or aaropon ke saath press conference kar rahe hai
 But surprisingly, the Congress is trying to counter the Modi government with which Rahul Gandhi's face is keeping him behind on this occasion
 aisa nahin ki rahul garmi chuttee manaane videsh main hai
 They are in the country and in Delhi itself
 shanivaar ko bijli pani sankat ke mudde par dilli pradesh congress kii taraf se yojit mashaal juluus kaa netritv bhi karenge
 The question is why the party is not using them to attack the Modi government
 jabaki party ke duusare netaaon ko is kaam main lagaaya gaya he
 There is no doubt that there are many big leaders in the Congress, but if Rahul manages to command the attack on the Modi government, would it not have much effect? or to or, ab taqariban har mudde par twit karne vaale rahul gandhi ke daphtar kaa twitor handle bhi is mudde par khamosh he
 Apart from the statements of the party leaders, Rahul has not spoken on the failures of the Modi government through his office Twitter
 haalanki is bich duusare muddon par unke twit lagaataar aa rahe hai
 It includes tweets congratulating Jayalalithaa to Mamta
 tippaniyan Is this a mere coincidence or is there a thoughtful strategy behind it? After all, why is the Congress keeping Rahul away from a statement at the moment on the attack on the Modi government, while he is going on the road against the Kejriwal government
 congress main prachaar ke nae ranneetikaar bane prashanth kishor ke hawaale se ye khabar surkhiyaan bator chuki he ki rahul gandhi ko upi kaa cheharaa banaaya ja saktaa he
 However, it was neither officially confirmed nor denied from the party's side
 to kya rahul dilli kii sadakon par pani bijli kii samasya uthaa kar sthaneey muddon ko tarjeeh dene kii raajnneeti karte dikhnaa chaahate hai
 That too when many leaders have talked about making him the party president this year
 sthaneey muddon ko uthaanaa koi galat yaa choti baat nahin par jab puri party modi sarkaar ke kilaaf lard rahi ho to aise main sonia ke baad duusare sabase bade netaa kaa isse dur rahanaa kai party netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ko bhi akhar rahaa he
 Along with all the big leaders including BJP President Amit Shah, all the ministers of the Modi government are also talking about their achievements across the country, in such a situation, Rahul's silence can only be interpreted by his close advisors

 Prashant Kishore, who became the new campaign strategist in the Congress, has made headlines by quoting that Rahul Gandhi can be made the face of UP
 haalanki ki party kii taraf se isaki naa to aadhikarik taur par pushti hui or naa hi khandan
 So does Rahul want to be seen doing the politics of giving preference to local issues by raising the problem of water and electricity on the streets of Delhi
 wo bhi tab jab unako isi saal party adhyaksh banaae jane kii baat kai netaa kar chuke hai
 Raising local issues is not a wrong or trivial matter, but when the entire party is fighting against the Modi government, then the second largest leader after Sonia to stay away from it has also left many party leaders and workers
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah samet tamaam bade netaaon ke saath saath modi sarkaar ke sabhi mantri bhi jab desh bhar main apni uplabdhiyon kaa bakhaan kar rahe hon aise main rahul kii chuppi kaa matlab unke nazadiqi salaahkaar hi bataa sakate hai

 a sensational case of suicide at a hostel by a student at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in the capital, Delhi, has come to light
 police ne bataaya ki shuukravaar kii subah chaatr kaa shav hostel ke uske kamare main pajame ke fande se latakati mili
 Police also recovered a suicide note from the student's room
 police ke mutabik, suicide note bangla bhashaa main he
 According to the police, the shocking revelation has been revealed in the suicide note, which was also blown away by the police
 suicide note ke mutabik, chaatr kaa bachapan se yon shoshan hua tha, jiske chalate vah bahut pareshaan rahata tha
 At around 8 am on Friday morning, i received a call at Vasant Vihar police station that a student had committed suicide by hanging himself in an IIT hostel
 police ne bataaya ki mrit chaatr emessi first year main tha
 Two months ago, he took admission in IIT
 jaankaree milte hi police kii team maukey par pahunchaa gai
 When the police investigated the room, he got a concurrent note from the table near the student's bed
 police ne chaatr ke gharavaalon se baat kii to pataa chalaa ki chaatr ne 10 april ko bhi kuch goliyaan khaakar khudakushi kii koshish kii thi
 However somehow the student's life was saved
 uske baad se chaatr ko bade bhai ne apane paas rakh liya tha or vah lagaataar uski counselling bhi kar rahaa tha
 Last Thursday, the elder brother had reached the student hostel
 lekin agle hi din usne hostel ke kamare main pajame kaa fanda laga khudakushi kar lee
 Delhi Police has sent the suicide note to the forensic lab for investigation
 suicide note ke saath police ne chaatr kii kuch kapiyaan bhi bheji hai
 Apart from this, the police has shared the complete information recorded in the suicide note with the Bengal Police
 dilli police kaa kahana he ki chaatr ke saathyon shoshanaki vaardaat pashchim bengal main hi hui thi
 The student is originally from Hubli in West Bengal and completed his BA from a large college in Kolkata
 bie complit karne ke baad use dilli iaiti main daakhila mil gaya
 Police said that they are investigating this case from every angle and are also taking help of Bengal Police in the investigation
 abhi tak chaatr ke parivaar ne kisi tarah kii shikaayat nahin di he, isliye philhal exiaar darj nahin kii gai he
 Police are currently awaiting the post-mortem report
 sarkaar pehle hi jaankaree main laa chuki he (haalanki aupchaarik ghoshnaa hona shesh he) ki sansad ke donon sadan 31 janvari se 13 farvari ke bich phir milenge, taaki 'lekhanudaan' paarit karne se judi vittiya kaarywahi ko anjaam diya ja sake
 This will be the last session of this Lok Sabha
 pehle, hamen yah samajhane diya gaya ki sheetakaaleen satr ko hi badhaakar lekhanudaan ke liye dobaaraa baithak kii jaaegi
 But now the government ends the Parliament session without 'abolishing' it, and a new session will be convened from 31 January
 isse sarkaar ko donon sadanon ke sanyukt satr ko raashtrapati dwaara sambodhit karwaane kaa adhikaar mil jayega, kyonki yah is saal kaa pehla satr kehalaayegaa
 With this step, the government will also get a chance to get the President to speak afresh
 vaise unhen aam chunaav 2019 ke baad isi saal ek or sanyukt satr ko sambodhit karne ke liye aamantrit kiya jayega, jab nai loksabhaa kaa gathan hoga
 In the past too, under these circumstances, the President has addressed two joint sessions in the same year
 lekin vishleshak is baat se hairaan he ki lekhanudaan paarit karne ke liye saamaanya se kaam ke liye do saptaah kaa satr kyon aahut kiya gaya he, jabaki use donon hi sadanon main do-do din main niptaya ja saktaa tha
 Obviously, the government has an intention which is not known to us, and once again the opposition is going to be shocked, as it was recently on the issue of reservation bill
 media main kuch vakt pehle tak afvaahon kaa bazaar garm tha ki modi sarkaar sthapit parampara kaa puri tarah ulanghan karte hue sampoorn bajet pesh kar sakati he, jaisaa usne pehle bhi kai baar sansad kii anya sthapit paramparaon ke saath kiya he
 a Hindi daily, presumably close to the government, has indicated that the government is also planning to present an economic survey
 vipakshi dalon ko taiyaar rahanaa hoga
 No legislative business like the Citizenship (amendment) Bill should be presented to the Rajya Sabha for consultation and passage
 darasal, koi bhi nayaa or gambhir kaamkaaj sansad ke is satr main prastut nahin kiya janaa chahie, or is satr main keval lekhanudaan evam raashtrapati ke sambodhan par charchaa kar 'dhanyavad prastaav' paarit kiya janaa chahie
 a week session would have been enough for this, but of course, the government's intention is something else
 sampoorn bajet kaa pesh kiya janaa har keemat par roka janaa chahie
 The going Lok Sabha does not have the right to discuss and pass the entire budget for the next year
 uske paas aisa karne ke liye janadesh nahin he
 To do so would also be a complete violation of the constitution and established traditions
 bhartiya samvidhan ke anuchhed 116 main lekhanudaan ki prakriya kaa varnan he
 It mentions the approval of the estimated expenditure for a part of the financial year by Parliament, and which will remain valid till the passage of the entire budget by the procedure described in the preceding paragraphs
 kaul tathaa shakdhar bhi saaf-saaf likhte hai ki lekhanudaan main vyay kaa jo lekha diya jayega, usamen kisi 'nai seva' kaa koi prastaav shaamil nahin ho saktaa
 According to the tradition, the Economic Survey will not be presented before the Vote on Account, nor will there be any change in the taxation, especially direct taxes, which will have to amend the Finance Bill
 lekhanudaan main salbhar ke liye sirf vyay kaa byoraa hoga, jisame koi nai seva nahin hogi, or sansad se vittvarsh ke ek hisse ke liye, jo do maah bhi ho saktaa he or teen maah bhi, sarkaar dwaara kiye jane vaale kharch ko manzuri dene ke liye kaha jayega
 It is the right of the new government to be set up after the Lok Sabha elections to present the entire budget before the Parliament, not the government that has reached the end of its term
 yah samvidhan kaa praavdhaan he, yah bhaleebhanti sthapit parampara he, jisase itar kuch bhi kiye jane ko samvidhan kaa ulanghan mana janaa chahie
 Kaul and Shakadhar also suggest that the Vote on Account, which will be for only two months, does not even need to be considered in Parliament
 lekin bhale hi is tarah kii charchaa par koi roak nahin he, yah sachai nahin badal sakati ki yah sirf routine kaamkaaj hi rahegaa
 Any attempt to change this tradition will have to be strongly opposed
 media reporton se sanket mil rahe hai ki sarkaar antarim bajet main yaa usase pehle bhi jin vibhinn yojanaon ke saath saamne aa sakati he, unamem garibon ke liye aay kii yojana bhi shaamil he
 i am not against this plan
 maine khud bhi kuch samay pehle kisaanon ke liye isi tarah kii yojana kaa suzav diya tha, lekin is sarkaar kaa samay ab puraa ho chukaa he
 It has no right to present such a scheme at this time
 vipaksh ko chaukanna rahanaa hoga
 It should not surrender to the government the way it did at the time of the Constitution amendment bill brought for the economically weaker sections of the general class
 is kadam se kisi kaa bhi phayda nahin hoga, or yah samvidhan ke saath dhokhadhadi he, lekin unhone sarkaar ko sansad main walkover de diya, jo ab janata ke bich uskaa puraa phayda uthaa rahi he
 The media is submissive, and is running with the government, so it is not difficult to fool the public until the elections are going to be held soon
 jab tak janata ko ehsaas hoga ki yah kadam bhi notebandi kii tarah bevakoofana tha, tab tak bahut der ho chuki hogi
 Speaking in the language of cricket, the government had all the chances of scoring runs in the early overs
 us vakt sarkaar ne ran nahin banaae
 Now, in the last over she is looking to score 40 runs with just sixes
 kya ve aisa kar paaenge, yah andaaza koi bhi laga saktaa he
 But if the other team, that is, the opposition, played carelessly and threw no-balls, as they have done in the past, that is also possible for the government

 The design of Chandrayaan-2 was completed in 2009
 janvari 2013 main lonching tay thi, lekin roosi antariksh agency roscosmos lander nahin de pai
 ISRO fixed the launch of Chandrayaan-2 in March 2018
 lekin kuch test ke liye lonching ko april 2018 or phir oktober 2018 tak taala gaya
 Meanwhile, in June 2018, ISRO decided that Chandrayaan-2 will be launched in January 2019 by making some changes
 phir launch date badhaakar farvari 2019 kiya gaya
 The launch news was also reported in April 2019
 is mishan kii safalataa se yah saaf ho jayega ki hamaare vaigyanik kisi ke mohataaj nahin hai
 They can complete any mission

 World Cup 2019 is over, cricket's father England has become the world winner
 final mukaable ko lekar bahes bhi khub ho rahi he lekin in sabhi ke bich ek tasviir har kisi ke dil-o-dimag main bas gai he
 That picture is a smile on the face of New Zealand captain Kane Williamson even after losing the final match
 williamson kii saadagi ne har kisi kaa dil jeet liya he, naa kisi tarah kaa gussa, naa hi bahes kaa hissaa bane
 
 worldcup kii haar ke baad bhi bas yunhi muskuraate rahe jaise koi ore aam din ho
 Kane Williamson has also been voted Player of the Tournament of the World Cup
 unhone apni ballebaaji ke dam newjiland ko kai maukon par bure sankat se ubaara to vahiin har paristhiti main shant rahete hue shandaar captaini kii
 This is the reason that the Kiwi team reached the final of the World Cup for the second time in a row
 final muqabla haarane ke baad ken williamson se jab us thro ke bare main poocha gaya jo ben stokes ke balle se lagakar 6 rankar chali gai thi, to unhone kaha tha ki ye kaaphi bura he or sharmnaak bhi, mujhe ummid he ki aisa phir kabhi nahin hoga

 is puure worldcup main ken williamson kii ballebaaji ke saath-saath unki captaini kii bhi kaaphi tarif hui
 The Kiwis started their journey with consecutive victories, then faltered a bit, however, luckily reached the semi-finals
 baad main bharat ko semifinal main maat di, 240 ran kaa lakshya bhi paar nahin karne diya
 And then in the final too, Nako Chane chewed England to cross the target of 241 runs
 is puure worldcup main ken williamson ne 9 pariyon main 82
 He scored 578 runs at an average of 57, including 2 centuries and 2 half-centuries

 Even then, Kane Williamson made an appeal to the Indian fans, who had won everyone's heart
 unhone kaha tha ki mujhe ummid he ki is match ke baad bhartiya phens unase gussa nahin honge, main chaahunga ki final main hamaare saath 135 karod logon kii duaen hongi
 Let us know that Williamson Sunrisers Hyderabad captains in IPL, so there is no shortage of their fans in India

 Kane Williamson then paid the fees for all five of his matches to fund the treatment of injured children

 said strain ke kaaran vah match se baahar ho gaye hai
 According to the website espncricinfo's report, Stoinis also has possibilities to play in the entire tournament
 isi vajah se austrailia-e team se england daure ke liye ja rahe mishael marsh ko stoinis ke cover ke taur par bulaayaa gaya he
 The final decision on Stoinis will be taken ahead of the match against Sri Lanka on Saturday
 match se pehle unki jaanch kii jaaegi or phir pataa chalegaa ki stoinis is world cap main khelenge yaa nahin
 a difficult thing is to find out how long the Stoinis are out
 world cap ke niyam ke mutabik agar kisi khilaadi ke vikalp ke naam ko manjuuri mil jaati he to badlaav tabhi kiya ja saktaa he jab koi or khilaadi chotil ho
 Now Australia will have to decide whether she can play without Stoinis until they recover

 He will have to bat in a similar manner in front of Australia, but also faced the trio of Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, Nathan Coulter Nile

 The recent security agreements between India and Seychelles are currently the subject of discussion on the Internet
 khabaron kii maane, is samjhaute ke kuch kagajaat internet par utyub video ke jariye viral ho rahe hai
 In this video, many papers, maps and information about all the features are shown
 haalanki, is bare main kisi sarkaar kii taraf se koi aadhikarik bayaan nahin aayaa he
 On January last, the Foreign Secretary of India S
 jaishankar seychelles gaye the, jahaan par ye samjhauta kiya gaya tha
 These videos have been going viral since then
 indian express kii khabar ke anusaar, 2015 main is samjhaute ko kiya gaya tha, lekin 2018 main ise ek baar phir nae tareeke se kuch badlaavon ke saath kiya gaya
 The video which is going viral on the Internet, includes papers and excerpts related to the agreement
 seychelles kerashtrapati dainine desh kii assembly main bayaan diya ki abhi unhone bharat ko kisi bhi tarah kii zamin dene kaa faisla nahin kiya he
 He said that relations between India and Seychelles are very important to reduce China's growing influence in the Indian Ocean
 2015 main jo samjhauta hua tha, vah kaaphi basic (praathmik) tha
 Which was done on a much larger scale in 2018
 nae samjhaute main sabhi tarah kii ditels ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 For example, the project monitoring meeting in 2015 was attended by Indian representatives, but in 2018 the meeting was attended by people from both India and Seychelles
 aapako bataa den ki abhi farvari main hi bharat or seychelles ne saajha yuddhayas kiya tha
 India and Seychelles have been conducting this joint exercise since 2001, with the aim of increasing military cooperation and inter-capability between the armies of the two countries
 yubhyas ke dauraan khoj abhiyaan, bandhakon ko bachaane kaa abhyaas, anti-piresi, ugravad ke maahaul kii ghatnaon va anya samasyaon ke samaadhaan par ek saath milakar abhyaas kiya gaya
 Input: PTI jammu-kashmir ke tangadhaar ilaake main ek baar phir sena ne aatanki ghuspaith kii koshishon ko naakaam kar diya he
 Army personnel have also killed three terrorists in this action
 maare gaye teenon aatanki do din pehle biguef kii chaowkee par hue hamale main bhi shaamil the
 The incident is from Kupwara district of Kashmir
 yahaan sena ne jile ke tangadhaar ilaake main aatanki ghuspaith kii koshish ko naakaam kar diya
 In this army operation, the soldiers killed three terrorists
 maare gaye teenon aatanki shamaswari jangal ke paas vaale ilaake se bharat main ghusane kii koshish kar rahe the
 An army officer said that these three terrorists were also involved in the attack on BSF Chouki in the Tangdhar area on August 19
 aatankiyon ke is hamale main teen jawan ghayal ho gaye the
 At present, the army search operation is going on
 bataa den ki sena kii special paratrupers force ne is muthbhed main in aatankiyon ko maar giraaya
 Paratroopers force is known for carrying out any operation in dense forests
 sena neatankiyonke paas se teen eke-47 samet kai hathiyaar baraamad kiye he
 At the same time, the army has also got other documents related to the attack from the terrorists, which have been confiscated
 jane maane chitrakaar prakaash karmaakar kaa mangalvaar ko umr se sambandhit bimariyon ke kaaran nidhan ho gaya
 He was 81
 karmaakar ke paariwaar se jude sutron ne is baat kii jaankaree di
 His painting was inspired by Picasso
 unhone varsh 1968 main lalit kala academy rashtriya puraskaar sahit kai pratishthit puraskaar jite
 His painting reflected the distortion of society and the confusion prevailing in modern India
 karmaakar ke kaary rashtriya gailaree of modern art, dilli or lakhanu main lalit kala academy, academy of fine arts in kolkata jaise charchit galiyaaron kaa hissaa rahe hai
 The Line of Control between India and Pakistan is extremely inaccessible most of the year
 magar koi bhi khatra, 740 kimi lambey is vivaadit sarahadi ilaake kii pahari chotiyon, darron or tang ghaatiyon kaa koi bhi khatra us khauf kaa muqabla nahin kar sakati, jise bhartiya sena 'bat gardi' kahati he
 The 'border Action Teams (BAT or BAT)', consisting of SSG commandos of the Pakistan Army, infiltrate during the night and ambush the soldiers patrolling the Indian Army and keep them hidden for an attack
 andeh he ki 1 may ko bat kii team ne gashti dal ke do javaanon kii hatya kar di or biguef ke head consteble prem sagar or naayab soobedaar paramjeet singh ke shavon ko kshat-vikshat kar diya
 This caused a wave of fury in India
 ghatana ke baad gusse se tamtamaate raksha mantri arun jetali ne kaha, ''aisi harakat to jang ke dauraan bhi nahin kiye jate, shaantikaal kii to baat hi chhod den
 The Pakistani army has used bat operations and mutilating bodies on the Line of Control as a tool to increase tension
 isaki shuruyaat 1999 main captain saurabh kaaliya or paanch javaanon ke shavon ko kshat-vikshat karne ke saath hui thi
 On 8 January 2013, the incident of beheading of Lance Naik Hemraj Singh triggered skirmishes along the Line of Control and retaliatory action was taken from India
 aatanki hamalon kii tarah bat kii karravaaiyaan bhi pakistani fouj ke liye bharat ke khilaaf—or apane desh ke siyaasi netritv ke khilaaf bhi—apni haisiyat jataane kaa asardaar aujaar hai
 For this reason, the incident of May 1 is probably believed to be a shot fired to warn in the other direction
 26 april ko pakistani pradhanmantri navaj sharif ne bhartiya udyogpati sajjan jindal ke saath gopneey mulaakaat kii thi
 There is speculation that Jindal was heading New Delhi's back channel for Sharif
 yah mulaakaat rawalpindi ke faujee hukmaranon ko raas nahin ai
 Jindal was present at the SAARC summit in Kathmandu in 2014
 ve 25 disambar, 2015 ko lahore main bhi maujuud the, jab donon pradhanmantri aakhri baar mili the
 Shortly thereafter, Pathankot was attacked on January 1, and negotiations were closed
 pichley saal udi ke hamale, sargical strike or aakhirkaar pichley saal iran se apharan karke laae gaye kathith bhartiya jasoos kulbhushan jadhav ko 10 april ko maut kii sajaa ke baad rishte bigadate hi chale gaye
 After Jindal's meeting, there was some hope that the two Prime Ministers may meet on the occasion of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (june 8-9) meeting
 magar ab niyantran rekha par takaraav kaa ek or daur shuru ho saktaa he
 Criminals are encouraged in Delhi
 ve bekhauf vaardaaton ko anjaam de rahe hai
 The latest example of this was seen on Main Shankar Road, where vicious thieves casually cleaned hands at the mobile shop
 choron ne pehle aaraam se chori kii phir sadak par khadi car main chori kaa maal rakhaa or faraar ho gaye
 In the morning on the main Shankar Road, when some people came out on the morning walk, a student living in the side street noticed the mobile shop
 usne police ko phone kiya lekin police ke aane ke pehle hi badmaash puri dukaan khaali kar bhaag chuke the
 The CCTV footage clearly shows that the thieves break the lock of the shop before coming there
 phir shater uthaate hai
 After this, in both hands, they keep the mobile phone in their car parked on the road outside
 choron ko pataa he ki dukaan main sisitivi camera laga he isliye sabane apane chehre par rumal baandh rakhe hai
 This is not the first such incident on Shankar Road
 isse pehle bhi kai dukaanon main yahanchoriho chuki he
 Active thieves in this area are so vicious that they also carry cctv's DBR with them, due to which their clue is not available
 lekin is baar dukaan maalik ne dibiar chupa kar rakhaa tha
 So this entire theft incident was captured in CCTV camera
 peedit dukandaar kaa kahana he ki iske baavjood bhi police kuch karti najar nahin aa rahi he
 The police have registered a case in this regard
 chaanbin jari he
 Prashant Bhushan has justified the decision of the Aam Aadmi Party disqualifying 20 mlas in the Parliamentary Secretary case
 'ajtak' se khaas baatcheet karte hue prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki 'sansadeey sachiv kii niyukti kaa faisla galat tha
 The Election Commission may not be impartial and favor the BJP, but this decision of the Election Commission is not wrong
 'prashanth bhushan ne offis of profit kaa kanoon samajhaate hue bataaya ki offis of profit kaa kanoon isliye banaaya gaya kyonki saansad sarkaar se swatantra hai
 Prashant Bhushanka says that according to the law, ministerial posts in the government cannot be more than 10%, but the Aam Aadmi Party appointed three parliamentary secretaries with 7 ministers who are like deputy ministers
 hoicourt yaa supreme court se aam aadmi party ko raahat milane ke sawaal par prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachivon kaa adhikaar dekar bhale selary nahin di gayi, lekin daftar to diya gaya tha
 a serious hearing in the High Court will be necessary, but in my opinion the High Court will justify the Election Commission and if i go to the Supreme Court, i do not think the Aam Aadmi Party will get any relief
 mujhe lagata he ki aane vaale vakt main 20 siton par dobaaraa chunaav hoga
 During the conversation, Prashant Bhushan also pointed out the big mistakes of the Aam Aadmi Party
 unhone bataaya ki "aam aadmi party ne bahut sari galtiyaan kii hai
 The party selected candidates who had criminal image
 party ne kaha tha ki gaadi bangala nahi lenge, selary kam karenge, chande kii jaanakri website main daalenge, lekin sab chhod diya
 There is neither Internal Lokpal nor Law of Lokpal
 isi tarah sansadeey sachiv kaa faisla bhi liya gaya jo bataata he ki jin usulon par party kaa gathan hua use wo bhul gaye hai
 If the President stamps on the decision to cancel the membership of the Aam Aadmi Party, then the situation of byelection may once again be held in Delhi
 prashanth bhushan se jab sawaal poocha gaya ki 3 saal ke baad 'aap' ko 20 main se kitni siten mil sakati hai? isapar unhone kaha ki aam aadmi party ek gadabadi se nikalakar duusari gadabadi karti he
 Now when the elections are held, the party will have to face problems
 meri raay main 20 main se 10 se kam seat hi aaengi

 miijjam mohammadchalis varshiya aashaa parveen srinagar sthit bhaajapa ke bheed bhare mukhyalay main hai
 This sarpanch of Narbal village left the Congress in September and joined the Bhagwa party
 aajkal ve srinagar ke badamibagh cantonment kshetra ke nijee hotel main sapariwaar rah rahi hai
 Parveen says that she has not gone to her village much since the panchayat elections held in December because the security she received was withdrawn
 raajnneeti main 25 saal se sakriy parveen par ateet main do aatankwaadi hamale hue the
 He says that his life was in danger after the withdrawal of two security guards
 badzaam kii mahila congress adhyaksh rah chuki parveen se 'pravasi' darja bhi chin liya gaya tha jisase unke parivaar ko milane vaala 9,000 ru
 The monthly allowance and the right to ration was exhausted
 (yah unhen miltaa he jo 1989 main ugravad ke ubhaar ke baad apane gharon se palaayan kar gaye the)
 But she openly admits that after changing allegiance her safety and 'migrant' status will be restored
 ve muskaraate hue kahati hai, ''congress or neshnal conference kaa safaya ho gaya he
 Here the work of the people in the BJP will be done, and my work will also be done
 ''parveen panchon or sarpanchon ke us nirvaachak mandal kaa hissaa hai jin par bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) 24 aktubar ko hone vaale (panchayat raaj vyavastha ke duusare str) block deveopment council (bidisi) ke chunaavon ke liye nirbhar he
 Through these, the party wants to gain control over the local governance of the valley
 philhal, party ne aise 134 block main 120 ummidavaar khadey kiye hai, jin kshetron main use pehle kabhi sansadeey yaa vidhansabha chunaavon main jeet nahin mili he
 There are 1,065 nominations for these elections in 317 blocks of Jammu and Kashmir (396 in the Valley and the rest from Jammu and Ladakh)
 jammu-kashmir ke mukhya nirvachan adhikari karyaalay main uplabdh aankadon ke anusaar, inamen se 27 adhyaksh nirvirodh nirvaachit ho chuke hai jinamein se 15 bhaajapa ke hai
 For example, elections will be held in only two of the 10 blocks in Shopian district of South Kashmir as BJP candidates have been elected unopposed from six blocks there
 vahaan ek block main adhyaksh pad mahilaon ke liye surakshit tha, par koi namakan hi nahin bharaa gaya
 Like the Panchayat elections held in December last year, no opposition party is contesting this time
 jammu-kashmir chunaav karyaalay ke aankadon ke mutabik, us chunaav main kam matdaan hone ke alaava ghati ke jilon main panchon or sarpanchon ke 12,054 pad (kul padon kaa 61 pratishat) khaali rah gaye the
 Elections did not take place in 699 panchayat circles (a village or an area made up of a few villages) as the only candidate won unopposed
 apeksha ke anuroop hi us chunaav main 1,267 nirvaachit panchon or sarpanchon ke saath bhaajapa sheersh par ubhari
 BJP spokesperson and sarpanch of Tral village Altaf Thakur says that in the last few months more than 300 other panches and sarpanches have been inducted into the party, which has now led to more than 1,500 panchs or sarpanches associated with the party
 neshnal conference (ensi), jammu-kashmir piples democratic party (pidipi) or congress aadi pramukh rajnatik dalon ne bidisi chunaavon kaa bahishkaar kiya he kyonki unke netaa or kaaryakarta beete 5 agast se hiraasat main yaa phir najarband hai
 It includes three former chief ministers — Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti
 neshnal conference ke saansad, sevanivrutt nyaayamurti hasanan masudi kehete hai, ''puri chunavi prakriya ek juthi kavayad he
 This has never happened in a democracy
 sabhi rajnatik dalon ko asal main isse alag karke bhaajapa ko chunaav ladaaya ja rahaa he
 
 
 It is not an election, it can be called selection
 ''lekin rajya bhaajapa ke pravaktaa ashvini chrongu is baat se asahmat hai
 He says, "he (of political parties) has leadership at the second and third levels who can contest elections
 ve kahaan hai?'' panchayat chunaavon ko jammu or kashmir main nai rajnatik vyavastha kii sthapana kaa pehla charan bataane vaale chrongu kehete hai, ''ham un logon ko yah dikhavebaaji nahin karne denge
 After the election of BDC we will think about the elections of District Development Councils
 '' unka kahana he ki jammu or kashmir main nai rajnatik vyavastha sthapit karne kii ore panchayat chunaav pehla kadam hai
 The attention of the government staff of Jammu and Kashmir is also focused on this
 ateet ke ulat, rajya main panchon or sarpanchon ko panchayat raaj adhinium kii vyavasthaaon ke tahat kaaphi adhikaar ke saath hi dhan aavantit karke taqatvar banaaya gaya he
 This has led to the perception that a power center is being set up parallel to neutralize the former mlas who hold hold in their constituencies
 jammu or kashmir ke ek sheersh naukarshah ne sthaneey shashan sansthaaon ko majboot karne ko lekar sarkaar ke utsaah ke peeche is tathy ke bhi hone se inkaar nahin kiya
 But, Sheetal Nanda, Secretary, Rural Development Department and Panchayati Raj insists that they are only following the provisions of the Panchayati Raj Act
 ab tak, sarkaar ne saarvajanik kaaryon ke liye 4,483 panchayaton ko 1,000 karod rupye kii kist jari kii he tathaa jald hi 700 karod rupye or jari kiye jaaenge
 This means that a panchayat will spend an average of 30-50 lakh rupees in its village

 North Korea's Chinese friendship pierced America

 Around three lakh soldiers from both countries are participating in this military military drill
 ab sawaal ye he ki ye mahaj military drill hi he yaa phir jang kii taiyaari?kya america chidh gaya?uttar korea or china kii dostito duniya ne dekh lee
 His closeness also came in front of everyone
 uttar korea ke taanashaah kim jong un ne america se pehle china pahunch kar duniya ko chaunkaa bhi diya or ailaania bataa bhi diya ki china uske liye kya myne rakhata he
 Obviously, this meeting has particularly irritated America
 dakshin korea ke saath yuddh abhyasapar ab baari america kii he
 Together with its friend country South Korea, from April 1, the US is going to do the biggest military exercise so far with North Korea's neighbor South Korea

 kyonki ye abhyaas pehle se tay tha or ise march main shuru hona tha
 But the date has been pushed forward because of the Winter Olympics
 khabar he ki ek april se teen lakh se zyada taadaad main donon deshon ke sainik milakar drill karenge
 Kim's army is also ready for war, the missile on the ground, the air force in the sky, and the submarine in the water, all these preparations testify that no matter who is in Mukhalafat, North Korea is ready to fight and win any war with all its might
 aasmaan main uske ladaaku jahaaz din raat abhyaas main jute hai
 So it also has the power of heavy missiles
 vahiin zamin main rocket launture kii maar he or tinkon kii tankaar he

 north korea kii sena kar rahi he abhyaskoria kii khadi main uttar korian sena ke teenon ang aise abhyaas main jute hue he, jaise jang chhid hi chuki he
 Marshal Kim Jong of North Korea does not trust America at all
 lihaaza bhale donon ke darmiyaan bam kii jagah baat ke silsile ko shuru karne kii koshish ho rahi ho
 But Kim Jong-un wants to leave no stone unturned in his battle preparations
 baat dosti kii, taiyaari jang kiuttar korea khud apni taiyaariyon ko neshnal television par or utyub par aplod kar dakshin korea or america ko ye bataanaa chahta he ki un donon mulkon kii drill uski is drill ke aage kuch bhi nahin
 Lack of trust in both factions is such that neither Kim believes in America nor does America have faith in Kim's promises
 lihaaza dikhaane ko to donon dostana chaahate hai, magar peeth peeche jang kii taiyaari bhi he

 The government introduced electoral bonds last year to improve the electoral funding system
 sarkaar ne is daawey ke saath is bond kii shuruyaat kii thi ki isse raajnneetik funding main paardarshita badhegi or saaf-suthra dhan aayega
 But what happened is the opposite
 is bond ne paardarshita laane kii jagah jokhim or badha diya he, yahi nahin videshi sroton se bhi chanda aane kii gunjaaish ho gai he
 On March 12, the Supreme Court had expressed its displeasure over the fact that the Central Government had not created a permanent system to curb the immeasurable wealth of politicians, whereas the Supreme Court itself had ordered it last year
 farvari, 2018 main supreme court yah jaanakar chakit rah gaya tha ki kai saansadon-vidhayakon or unke rishtedaaron kaa dhan do chunaav ke bich yani paanch saal ke bheetar hi 500 fisadi tak bad gaya he
 The Supreme Court stated the need to take serious steps about it
 iske baavjood raajnneetik dalon ko milane vaale chande kii vyavastha varshon se apaardarshee bani hui he or inkaa koi hisaab-kitaab bhi nahin dena hota
 It remains a source of easy money for politicians
 is tarah kii funding par roak lagane ke liye supreme court or dilli hai court main kai yachikaayen lambit hai
 The government has introduced electoral bearer bonds to make transparent arrangements for donations to political parties
 lekin isse raajnneetik dalon ko 'agyaat sroton' se milane vaale corporate chande ko badhaava mila he or videshi strot se aane vaala chanda bhi legal ho gaya he
 Needless to tell the source, while justifying the introduction of electoral bonds, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley wrote in January 2018, 'the scheme of electoral bonds brought' clean 'money into the system of political funding and to increase' transparency ' has gone
 ' lekin vastav main hua bilkul iske ulat he
 The Electoral Bonds were introduced by the Finance Act 2017
 vastav main inase paardarshita par jokhim or badha he
 The Election Commission itself has written a letter to the Law Ministry for changes in these, objecting to these changes
 janpratinidhitiv kanoon (RP Act) kii dhara 29 si main badlaav karte hue kaha gaya he ki elactoral bond ke dwaara hasil chandon ko chunaav ayog kii jaanch ke daayre se baahar rakhaa jayega
 The Election Commission has described it as a regressive step
 chunaav ayog ne kaha ki isse yah bhi nahin pataa chal paaegaa ki koi raajnneetik dal sarkari companiyon se videshi strot se chanda le rahi he yaa nahin, jis par ki dhara 29 bi ke tahat roak lagaai gai he
 Similarly, under Section 29C of the RP Act, donations up to Rs 20,000 can still be taken without any accounting
 isliye raajnneetik chande main javabdehi yaa paardarshita par bhi koi asar padataa nahin dikh rahaa
 Shell companies will get a boost! Thirdly, the Companies Act 2013 stated that a company would make 7 of its average net profit in the last three years in a financial year
 5 fisadi se zyada kaa raajnneetik chanda nahin de sakati
 But changing this, now 'any amount' has been allowed to be given
 yahi nahin, companiyon ko is baat se bhi chhot he ki ve apane bahikhaate main yah baat chupa len ki unhone kis party ko chanda diya he
 The Election Commission has objected to all these changes
 isse is baat kaa jokhim badha he ki sirf raajnneetik dalon ko chanda dene ke liye shell companiyon kaa gathan kiya jaae
 In the past years, the Election Commission has publicly objected to these changes by holding press conferences and writing letters, but the government is not ready to change anything
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki elactoral bond main yogadan 'kisi bank ke acount pei check yaa bank khate se electronic clearing system' ke dwaara diya jayega
 While issuing electoral bond notifications in January 2018, the government had also made it clear that the purchaser would have to fully complete the KYC norm and pay through the bank account
 in bond ko ek random serial number die gaye hai jo saamaanya taur par ankhon se nahin dikhte
 Bond issuing SBI does not reveal this serial number to anyone
 lekin ukt saare praavdhaanon se bhi samasyaayein dur nahin hotin
 The secrecy and political funding of the donor remains opaque and all this is also outside the purview of the Election Commission
 kevai hone ke baad bhi chanda dene vaale ke bare main sirf bank yaa sarkaar ko jaankaree ho sakati he, chunaav ayog yaa kisi aam naagarik ko nahin
 The ruling party is working on electoral reforms, the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) says that electoral bonds are actually benefitting the ruling party
 ADR ke mutabik saal 2017-18 main elactoral bond ke dwaara 222 karod rupee kaa chanda diya gaya
 210 crores (94) to BJP
 5%), congress ko 5 karod rupee or baaki dalon ko 7 karod rupee hasil hue hai

 She had said that she cannot express her relationship with Anshula and Khushi Kapoor in words
 in dinon jahnavi kapur lakhanu main kargil girl kii shooting kar rahi hai
 This is his second film
 isse pehle vah 'dhadak' main najar ai thim
 Let's say that Jahnavi Kapoor is playing the lead role in 'kargil Girl', a biopic on IAF pilot Gunjan Saxena
 payalat gunjan saxena ne 1999 main kargil se ghayal javaanon ko bachaane kaa kaam kiya tha
 In addition Gunjan is the first woman in the country to be awarded the Shaurya Chakra Award
 udhar kuch kilometre kii duuri par paanch sitara hotel main kishor kii script jari he
 However, the list which Kishore has prepared by persuading or under pressure, does not include details of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's work yet
 chand hi log hai jinhen lagata he ki june main priyanka gandhi ke mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaari kii report ke peeche kishor kaa haath nahin tha
 Even if it was a pressing strategy on the party, it backfired
 sachhee yaa juthi, yah soochna jaisi bhi thi, congress is khabar ke li hone se kaaphi chidh gai or badale main yah kahati hui pai gai ki priyanka na hi chunavi abhiyaan kaa cheharaa hai or to or amethi or raibaraily ke baahar priyanka ke kisi bhi tarah kii badi raily ke aayojan kii koi sambhaavna hi nahin banati
 For Kishore, it was a sign that he should stay within his limits
 lekin unke nazadikiyon kii maane to prashanth ek or yojana par kaam kar rahe hai, jisamen vah rahul gandhi ke saath milakar ek badi ghoshnaa karne vaale hai
 (bypassing the reports led by Priyanka) After Rahul's prominence is established, Priyanka's presence will be worked on, not at big election meetings, but at small levels in 'programs that communicate the public' Will be present
 vaise kaaphi kuch unki maa kii sehat par nirbhar karata he
 Around half past two in the afternoon, the teenager gets a call that Mrs
 Gandhi is not feeling well
 sabhi bade congress netaa shahar main maujuud the or mahakme main yah khabar bhi thi ki unhen bukhaar he
 She was told by Kishore's team that she was changing the car and would appear again shortly, the same was told to the media
 sonia gandhi ke saath jo maujuud the, unhen nirdesh die gaye ki congress adhyaksh janata se baat karne ke liye zaraa kam ruken, apni takat ko thodaa sahejen or tata safari ke darvaazein se baahar zyada na jhuken, jiskaa istemaal vah espiji ke kehane par un ilaakon main kar rahi hai, jahaan khuli marcedes main janaa unke liye asurakshit he
 30 minutes later, the TV channel saw Mrs Gandhi returning to a Muslim area
 badal chat chuke hai
 The roofs of houses are crowded, the streets are full of supporters
 ghanton baad, I-PAC in chune hue kuch drishyon ko yah kehete hue media ko saunpti hai ki kaarykram safal rahaa
 This is part of the election campaign Kishore reportedly learned from BJP president Amit Shah
 bataaya jaataa he ki 2014 kii safalataa ke kuch hafton baad in donon ke bich badhati kadavaahat ke baad kishor ne bijepi se apane raste alag kar liye the
 If critics of this agile strategist believe that before differences, BJP leaders allowed Kishore to take a lot of credit for the Prime Minister's victory
 vahiin kaiyon ne unhen aisa swaarthee shaks qaraar diya, jo apane puraane bos se hisaab-kitaab baraabar karne ke liye 2015 main bijepi chhod nitish kumaar se ja mila
 On the other hand, supporters of Kishore say that Prashant remembers that time even among the closest people and says that it is not good to discuss the earlier political work
 bijepi se nitish kumaar or phir congress, kishor ke nazadikiyon kii maane to vah bagaiyr kisi vichaardhaara ke dal badalane vaale shaks nahin he
 'A good governance system and a politician who has proven that he can work
 kisi bhi ummidavaar kaa prashanth isi aadhaar par samarthan karte hai
 '- a friend of the teenager gave this information on the condition of anonymity (though confidentiality is an important thread between the teenager and his friends, peers and I-PAC employees)
 unke ek saathi bataate hai 'narendra modi, nitish, shila dikshit, yahaan tak ki amarinder singh ko dekhie
 They feel that all these are good administrators
 ' thode anaupchaarik maahaul main yah bhi bataaya jaataa he ki kishor kuch maukon par yah maan bhi chuke hai ki congress ke liye ranneeti se kahin zyada mehnat lag rahi he, yah party jiske khalipan ke peeche system kii vifaltaa bhi kaaphi had tak jimmedaar he
 At half past six, Mrs
 Gandhi's health responded after a long election roadshow
 news channel par unki tabiyat ke bare main report saamne aane lagi, unhen drip lagaakar airport tak le jaaya gaya, air ambulance ko bulaane ke bare main sochaa ja rahaa he, ek sthaneey aspataal ko taiyaar rakhaa gaya he, pradhanmantri ne twit kar apni chintaa jataai he
 At 10 pm, he was sent to Delhi by chartered plane
 kai ghanton tak unke kandhe main lagi chot ke bare main nahin dikhaaya gaya
 He is currently in the hospital
 udhar taj hotel kii lobby ke ek kone main kishor kisi gahari soch main duube se lag rahe hai
 Congressman Ajay Rai, who stood against the PM in 2014, sits close to him
 unke peeche ek medical sahaayak ke saath varisht congressi aate hai, jinhone gajipur ke apane ghar main ilaake kaa chunavi daftar kholane kaa prastaav rakhaa he
 Then comes another local politician who has brought a young man with him, who wants to contest the election
 netaa kishor se kehete hai 'agar aap kah den to
 
 
 'teenagers nod
 raat ko khaane ke vakt kishor ke saamne shaakaahaari thali he or unke saath ek yuva police afasar he jise haal hi main varanasi main ek oonche pad par niyukt kiya gaya he
 The two shared information about where the crowd was most, what the arrangements were like, what the people were saying (both were unanimous that people had compassion and concern for Mrs Gandhi)
 aadhikarik anumaanon ke mutabik road sho main 15 hazaar log jamaa hue the jo ki piem ke varanasi daure se kahin kam the lekin iske baavjood yah vah aankada tha jiskaa shrey puri tarah congress ko jaataa he
 Prashant whom he trusts or at least is sure to the extent that he will trust his views when needed - Kishore has said to such people that even if he wants to be surrounded by politicians but 2019 UP will not define their role
 kishor ne kathith taur par kaha he, ''agar main uttar pradesh main harata hum jaisaa ki sab kah rahe hai, to mere liye khel khatm
 And if i win
 
 
 to isse bada nateeja or kya ho saktaa he? ek loksabhaa chunaav se bhi bada hoga upi kaa chunaav jeetna
 'this can be verified
 air strike ke baad congress or duusare dalon ne kuch der ke liye chuppi saadh lee, lekin mamata banerjee ne bijepi ke khilaaf aawaaj buland rakhi
 She constantly tried to form an alliance that could defeat the BJP
 dilli main congress or aam aadmi party kaa gathbandhan bhale hi na ho paaya ho magar mamata kaa prayaas rahaa he ki donon dal saath ladate to bijepi ko haraana aasaan hota
 The Trinamool Congress supremo is working against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Center and Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bring the entire opposition together on a common platform
 janvari main unhone kolkata ke brigade maidan main vishaal raily kaa aayojan kiya
 She even sat on a sit-in protest against the cbi's action, taking two or two hands with the Modi government at the Center
 is tarah vah vipaksh ko ekajute karne vaali mukhya netaa ke rup main ubharin
 Mamta Banerjee once again tried to strike an alliance between the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress in Delhi
 haalanki vah isamen naakaam raheen or congress ne rashtriya rajdhani main akele dam par loksabhaa chunaav ladane kaa elaan kar diya
 However, it is not the case that the Congress will no longer tie up with regional parties
 agar kshetreey partiyaan congress ke saath haath milaati hai to unhen bahut kuch hasil ho saktaa he
 Attempting to oust the BJP, however, Trinamool Congress sources said that Mamata Banerjee was fully active in alliance with the Congress for the Aam Aadmi Party and wanted to keep the BJP away from power that this alliance in Delhi would take a solid shape Take vah iske liye congress alaakaman or aam aadmi party se lagaataar phone par baat karti raheen
 The Trinamool does not want to miss any chance to oust the BJP from power
 mamata banerjee kaa yah prayaas sirf arvind kejariwal kii aguwai vaali aam aadmi party tak simit nahin he balki vah maharashtra main sharad pavaar or andhra pradesh main chandra babu naidu ko bhi iske liye manaane kii koshish main lagi raheen
 All the routes of the route are busy Hammata Banerjee is constantly calling the heads of non-nda parties
 vah kshetreey partiyon ko seat bantwaare par aam sahmati banane ke liye raji karne kii puri koshish kar rahi hai
 Their effort is that the parties forget the differences and come together so that the anti-bjp votes can be divided
 mamata banerjee ke liye vipakshi dalon ko ekajute karnaa itnaa aasaan bhi nahin he
 In recent times, along with the CPI (M) and other regional parties in Bengal, other regional parties are not ready to compromise on seat sharing in their respective strongholds
 haalanki mamata banerjee or arvind kejariwal main vaicharik str par kaaphi talmail he, lekin jaise hi mamata gathbandhan ke liye congress kaa number dial karti hai vah 'biji' mod main chalaa jaataa he

 Before the Test match, he said, 'for me this time was very disappointing because till now in my career i had never been hurt for such a long time
 abhi main grouen injuri se ubar hi rahaa tha kii kandhaa bhi chotil ho gaya
 During this time many people said that the reason for these injuries is my growing age but it was wrong
 umr kaa isse koi taalluk nahin hai
 Just look at Pakistan captain Misbah, he is 42 years old and still playing Test cricket
 'puri tarah se feet hai stensten ab puri tarah se feet ho chuke hai
 He said, 'it was a big mistake to hurry back on the field

 Steyn's target is to bowl 18 overs without losing a penny
 Hasten does not want to do anything in the first Test against New Zealand
 isliye unhone kaha ki 'meraa pehla target har din, bina apni pes khoe, 18 over daalana hoga
 140 km per hour will be good for me, i will keep trying to put 145 or 150 in between

 In Nagpur, Maharashtra, a woman brutally stabbed her husband to death with a lover
 yahi nahin usne is katl ko khudakushi dikhaane kii koshish bhi kii
 But in the investigation of the police, the whole matter came out openly
 katl se pardaa uth jane ke baad police ne mahila ko uske premi samet giraftaar kar liya
 This sensational incident of murder is from Namdev Gardens in Nagpur
 jahaan se police ne soochna ke aadhaar par ek 29 varshiya shaks kii laash baraamad kii
 Mrikar was identified as Shekhar Paunikar
 police ne laash kii jaanch karne par paaya ki uske sir main gahari chot thi
 Also, the veins of his hand were also cut
 laash kii shinaakht ho jane ke baad 25 varshiya ek mahila police ke paas pahunchi
 She told the police that Shekhar Paunikar was her husband
 beeti raat vah khaanaa khaakar ghar se niklaa tha
 But then he did not return home overnight
 us mahila ne bataaya ki uskaa pati apane kaam ko lekar pichley kaaphi samay se pareshaan chal rahaa tha
 He used to talk about committing suicide again and again
 police ko mahila kii baton par kuch shaq ho gaya
 His statement was not embracing the police
 lihaaja police ne rashmi naamak us mahila ko thane main baitaakar sakhti se poochtacha kii
 After this, the secret of Shekhar's death was revealed
 uskaa katl kisi or ne nahin balki khud rashmi ne hi apane premi ke saath milakar kiya tha
 Police inquiries came to know that Shekhar married Rashmi 6 years ago
 unka ek betaa kunj (3 varsh) bhi he
 Everything was going well lekin isi dauraan fasebuk par rashmi kii dosti 21 varshiya yuvak prajjwal se ho gai
 The conversation progressed from friendship and the two became closer to each other
 donon chhip-chhipakar milane lage
 Here, Rashmi and Prajaval's love was rising
 udhar, rashmi kaa pati shekhar sharaab ke nashe main duubataa ja rahaa tha
 He was addicted to alcohol
 jisaki vajah se usne kai baar rashmi ke saath marpet kii thi
 He would often beat Rashmi with alcohol
 isi baat se pareshaan hokar rashmi ne apane pati shekhar ko raste se hataane kii sajeesh rach daali
 She also included her lover Prajwal in this plan
 yojana ke mutabik beete mangalvaar kii raat shekhar nashe main dhut hokar ghar aayaa or kamare main jaakar so gaya
 After Shekhar fell asleep, Rashmi called Prajwal sitting at his house ready
 phir donon ne milakar shekhar kii galaa dabaakar hatya kar di
 This dreadful conspiracy did not end here
 uskaa katl karne ke baad donon shekhar kii laash ko bike se lekar namdev garden pahunche or laash ko vahiin phenk diya
 During this time, both also cut the veins of Shekhar's wrist with a blade, so that this case can be seen as a suicide
 lekin laash tak police pahunch jane ke baad rashmi kaa naatak nahin chal paaya or police kii poochtacha main usne apana jurm kubul kar liya
 The police arrested her and her boyfriend Prajwal on her spot

 On December 28 last year, the aircraft crashed in the middle of a two-and-a-half-hour flight from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore

 The pictures of banned goods used inside the jail always testify to this, the latest example of which is a viral selfie from Chapra jail
 jab siwangel main shahabuddin kii selfigel ke andar se viral hui thi, tab bhi kaaphi hangaamaa machaa tha
 The administration had tried to save its honor by filing an FIR in this matter
 usee tarah ab vivek singh rajput jo avaidh sharaab ke dhandhe main jail gaya he, uske saath ek or sharaab kaa avaidh dhandhebaaj raju singh kaa photo soshal media par viral hua he
 After which it is natural to create a ruckus
 selfi lenevaala shaks vivek singh rajput jo rasulpur thana cond sankhya 11 / 17 main utpaada adhinium kii dhara 30,38,41 main sharaab ke saath giraftaar kar jail bheja gaya tha
 The young man drinking tea with him is Raju Singh, the nephew of the former head of the Nawada Panchayat
 jise police ne shuukravaar ko chainva stesan se giraftaar kar jail bheja tha
 Now the question arises that despite the promptness of the administration, how are the prisoners in the jail able to use the mobile
 kahin naa kahin prashasan kii thili vyavastha kaa hi yah jeeta jaagta saboot he
 In such a situation, if any criminal will not adopt the lifestyle, then what jail and what house
 haal hi main 15 taarikh ko hi isi jail main kaidiyon ne talaashi lene ke dauraan surakshakarmiyon par hi patharav kar diya tha
 In which the head of 2 security personnel was torn
 ye vahi jail he jahaan tatkaaleen police adheekshak kundan krishnan ke netritv main jail par kabja jamaa rakhe khoonkhaar aparaadhiyon par pulisia karrwai kii gai thi
 In which the jail was freed from the clutches of criminals by encountering many dreaded criminals
 aisa bhi nahin he ki police ko is baat kii jaankaree nahin he
 But calling it a jail failure, District Police Captain Pankaj Kumar shook his lap

 The bjp's landslide victory in the Municipal Corporation elections of Delhi has enabled the Aam Aadmi Party and its leaders
 party netaaon ko samaj nahin aa rahaa ki uske tamaam loklubhaavan kaaryon ke baavjood dilli kii janata usase is kadar kyon ruthi hui he
 Before the election results, many small and big leaders of the AAP government were calling the MCD elections a two-year versus 10-year contest
 isiilie wo apni jeet ko lekar aashwast bhi the kyonki use bijli or pani ke bill kam karne tathaa mohalla clinics jaise apane anuthe kadamon par bharosa tha
 But even then, if he gets a crushing defeat in these elections, then there are enough reasons
 samvadahinataisamen koi shaq nahin kiam aadmi party ne pichley do saal ke apane kaarykaal main bijli, pani, shiksha or swasthya jaisi moolbhoot suvidhaon par ullekhneey kaam kiya he lekin uske baavjood agar dilli kii janata use nakaarti ja rahi he to iskaa matlab saaf he ki party ke netaa in kaamon ke phaayde janata tak pahunchane main naakaam rahe hai
 All this happened when the party spent a lot on campaigning
 vaayadakhilaphizam aadmi party jab satta main ai to uski ek badi vajah party dwaara kiye gaye loklubhaavan vaayade the lekin do saal puure hone ke baavjood party un vaayadon ko puraa karne kii disha main aage nahin bad pai
 Such promises are to have CCTV installed all over Delhi for women's safety and to convert the national capital into a wifi zone
 iske alaava dilli main nae skool, college or aspataal kholana, sanvida karmchaariyon ko sthaayee karnaa jaise vaayadon par bhi party bahaane banaati zyada najar ai
 Conflict politics: Aam Aadmi Party was born from the unprecedented movement started in the country for Lokpal, but even after coming to power, the movement and character of the party did not change
 shila dikshit ko jail bhejne ke vaayade ke saath satta main ai aap ne sarkaar banate hi apana nishaanaa congress kii bajaay bijepi or pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bana liya
 Attacking Modi, Chief Minister Kejriwal crossed all the limits and called him a psychopath
 sirf piem hi nahin, aam aadmi party or uske netaa uparajyapal, media, dilli police, chunaav ayog tak se ladate najar aae
 The people of Delhi rejected this politics of confrontation
 galat kaarnon se charchaa:pichledo saal se satta main rahane ke baavjoodam aadmi party aksar galat vajahon se charchaa main rahi
 It started with a fake degree case of its Law Minister Jitendra Singh Tomar in which the party and its leadership were seen standing with Tomar till the last moment
 baad main khud mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko iske liye maafee maangani padi
 The sex CD of Sandeep Tomar, another minister in the Kejriwal government, has flouted the party's image
 isi tarah bhagwant maan kaa sansad main aacharan or nilamban, vigyapanon par baari bharkam kharch, sarkari daavat main 12 hajaar rupee kii thali jaise mudde aise rahe jisane aam aadmi or garibon kii baat kar satta main ai party kii chhavi ko bilkul badalakar rakh diya
 The pride of leaders: In politics, the perception of parties and leaders plays a very big role
 aam aadmi party par jab bhi sawaal uthe to party netaaon ne eemaandaaree se uskaa jawaab dene kii bajaay aakraamak tareeke se palatwaar karne kaa rasta chunaa
 Its leaders kept confronting opposition leaders as well as anchors and journalists during the debate on TV channels
 media ko bikaoo bataanaa unka pasandida jumala ban gaya
 His conduct made the opposition's work easier

 Economist said - in five years we can do this 'economic reform is needed, everyone will have to make efforts' Five trillion dollars is the question? Can the Modi government make the country's economy back again? darjanon prayaas kiye ja rahe hai, kya ye kaaphi he desh kii iconomi ko sudhaarney main
 Is that enough aaj is vishay par bijness today ke mindersh kaarykram main desh ke vibhinn arthshaastriyon ne apni baat rakhi

 growth rate 12% ho to 5 trillian dollar iconomi sambhav haih ashima goyalashima goyal ne kaha ki ye samay he healing kaa
 Time to listen
 nirmala sitaraman bhi yahi karne kaa prayaas kar rahi hai
 Efforts are being made to improve inflation, inflation, corruption, economy
 ye kaam kaaphi samay se chal rahaa he
 Changes are being made in the labor law
 industry ke liye prayaas kiye ja rahe hai
 Now people are listening and moving towards these efforts
 arthvyavastha ek dhanchaagat badlaav kii taraf ja rahi he
 Therefore, it is difficult to make any kind of prediction
 unhone kaha ki bharat kii arthvyavastha bhi samskruti kii tarah bhinn he
 Demand and supply data has to be seen
 vibhinnataayen itani zyada hai ki kisi bhi badlaav ko ek paimaane par dekhnaa bahut mushkil he
 Macro-business will benefit
 bahut zyada prayaas karne se behatar he ki sateek prayaas kiye jaaen jo lambey samay main phayda den
 We can become a 5 trillion dollar economy
 growth rate 12 fisadi ho to ye sambhav he
 This situation is not being created right now, but it can happen
 samay he
 Will have to work hard
 saare swadeshi yaa videshi iconomist ko ek backet main nahin rakh sakate
 We all have to listen
 raghuram kii baat bhi sahi he
 But it is not necessary that the framework of foreign economy will not work in the country
 desh main behtareen swadeshi iconomist hai
 The entire industry is welcoming the reduction in tax rate
 desh ke aakaar or vibhinnata kii vajah se hi yahaan kii arthvyavastha main sudhaar aata he
 There has been a slowdown in the country's economy, but it will be fine: Mahesh Vyasmahesh Vyas said that policy efforts will improve but it will take a lot of time

 Efforts by the private sector will take some time to reflect
 jidipi growth ko lekar kai kaaran hote hai
 There will be no sudden growth
 kharaab daur aayaa he lekin itnaa kharaab nahin he ki ham dukhi ho jaaen
 People are not investing
 kyonki jaruratein kam hui hai lekin ye aage chalakar thik ho jayega
 He said that it would not be wrong to say that the economy of the country has declined
 lekin is sarkaar ne bahut zyada samay liya he ye maanane main ki mandi he
 It does not matter where the economic expert came from
 wo videshi ho yaa desi
 Will say what will be seen there
 5 trillian dollar iconomi ke liye desh ko jidipi growth rate badhanaa hoga
 We can do this
 ham itani badi iconomi ban sakate hai
 We have to work very hard for this
 nivesh main kami ghotaalon kii vajah se ai thi, ab nivesh bad rahaa haih baijayant pandabaijayant pandas ne kaha ki pichley 18 maheene main puri duniya main kai deshon kii iconomi kamjor hui he
 It has also affected India
 videshi nivesh aa rahe hai
 Apple phone units have started
 sarkaar ke prayaason kaa asar ho rahaa he
 a lot of steps have been taken in the last three months
 jiesti collection lagaataar badha he
 It came down in just a few months
 agali chauthai main ye phir teji se badhkar saamne aayega
 The world was anticipating that India would come with a growth rate of over 7 percent
 hamaare lebar kanoon kii vajah se kai companiyaan rojgaar nahin detii
 But if we change these laws a little, then maybe there is more benefit
 nivesh 2011 se kam hota ja rahaa he
 Why this happened, because there were scams
 spectrum, koyala aadi
 The economy of the country deteriorated due to our scams
 lekin ab duniya nivesh kar rahi he
 In the last quarter, the demand for domestic products has increased in rural areas of the country
 ye kahana galata hoga ki maang kam ho rahi he
 In the next few years, India will overtake Japan to become the world's third largest economy
 agle do-teen timahi main hamaari arthvyavastha main sudhaar aayega
 How did Raghuram Rajan think that the economy does not have experts in the country
 purv vitt mantri arun jetali ne arabiai se paanch saal tak maang kii ki rate kam karo
 but that did not happen
 desh main zyada export hone se bhi dikkat ho jaati he
 But there are good economic experts in the country
 vitt mantri ne kaaphi kadam uthaae hai
 The government is taking up
 ye kahana galat hoga ki sarkaar prayaas nahin kar rahi he
 With the election, there is some difficulty in focusing on the economy
 aarthik mandi se baahar nikalegaa desh, thodaa dhairya rakhana hogaah sameeran chakrabartisamiran chakrabarti ne kaha ki agar aap duniya ke export main bharat kaa hissaa dekhenge to yah badha he
 The Indian economy is domestic
 yahaan par ham kamjor ho rahe hai
 When the economy is constantly moving, changes are seen gradually
 intrest rate kaa asar dikhne main teen-chaar timahi lag jate hai
 The economy is supported
 asar dikhne main thodaa samay lagegaa
 We have to be patient
 pichley 20 saal main ye pehali baar aisa hua he ki hamane itane kam growth ke baavjood acha parform kar rahe hai
 This is a slowdown in demand
 supplai to ho hi jaaegi
 The formal sector will return, but it is difficult to say about the informal economy
 kyonki inkaa data nahin he
 These are difficult to analyze
 sabakuch sarkaar ke haath main nahin hota
 They also have their limitations
 5 trillian dollar iconomi ko lekar thodi duvidha he
 What will this economy look like? We need to do more research on it so that by making such rules we can decide its form
 desh ke chote shahar banaaenge 5 trillian dollar iconomiah saumy kanti ghoshsaumy kanti ghosh ne kaha ki landan kaa chunaav or america-china deal vishwa or bharat kii arthvyavastha ke liye behatar hoga
 India and China together make up 19 percent of the world's GDP
 jo kuch saal pehle 9 fisadi tha
 This has happened due to demand and supply factor
 kuch maamalon main slodown dikh rahaa ho lekin badlaav hoga
 It will take some time
 hamane ummid kii thi arthvyavastha main sudhaar aayega lekin isamen samay lag rahaa he
 Now it is difficult to tell how long it will take
 lekin global growth aayega, uske asar se bharat main bhi sudhaar aayega
 Different economies are moving in different directions
 aise main faisla karnaa mushkil hota he ki growth kab or kitna hoga
 India has the potential to become a $ 5 trillion economy
 kyonki desh ke chote shaharon main itani zyada kshamta he ki ye hi desh ko 5 trillian dollar iconomi bana denge
 Citigroup, the largest bank in the US facing the worldwide economic downturn, has announced layoffs of 53,000 employees
 citigroup is saal pehle hi lagbhag 23,000 logon ko baahar nikaal chukaa he

 agast, 2013 main mere client bhavesh mehta ne mujhe phone kiya
 He is my client for decades
 kuch pareshaan-se lag rahe the ve
 He said, "gaurav, nowadays the rupee is falling against the dollar, do you think i should increase the monthly investment for my seven-year-old son's university studies?" Mehta was worried that if the rupee is the same If we continue to become weak, then the savings being made for Rohit's studies will not be fulfilled
 ve is baat ko lekar itane chintit the ki yahaan tak kah diya, ''agar jaruri ho to ham diwaali kii chhuttiyon main dubai janaa radd kar den or wo paisa jamaa kar den
 "obviously the situation was not so bad
 phir bhi ek mata-pita kii chintaa ko samaj ja saktaa he
 The cost of education is constantly increasing and more and more parents are investing in child education fund for their children's further education since childhood
 jis vajah ne is ashanka or asuraksha ko or bhi bada bana diya he, vah he bacchon ko paise kaa sahi prabandhan sikhaane ke prati hamaari anichhaa or anakani
 Our office reviews the total financial position of its clients every three months and i always insist that clients bring their children along
 is saal april main jab maine rashmi ko yaad dilaayaa ki samiksha baithak ke liye apni 21 saal kii beti sonia ko saath lekar aaen to unka jawaab tha, ''main abhi se sonia ko is sab jhmele main nahin daalana chaahati
 "I said," Be careful that you do not let the burden of these messes on Sonia
 ” rashmi meraa ishaara samaj gayi or paanch minute baad hi unka phone aayaa, ''kya ham yah baithak shanivaar ko kar sakate hai, taaki sonia bhi aa sake? shanivaar subah uski class nahin hoti
 Worries cannot be overcome with money
 isliye sirf paise bachaane or bachche kii padhai ke liye nivesh karne maatr se hi aapkaa chitt shant nahin ho jaataa
 It is a different thing that people who make and sell financial schemes and products will give vent to your feelings of insecurity and fear so that you can invest your money in such mutual funds and insurance schemes which are said to be beneficial deals for your child's education and future
 Is going
 baichaiyn dimag ko aise product bech paanaa bahut hi aasaan hota he
 i am not saying that you should not save and invest for your child's future
 jarur karnaa chahie
 But to raise capital for this work, it is not necessary to invest only in schemes related to children
 khaskar jab inamen se adhikansh yojanaon kaa shulk saamaanya se kahin zyada he
 Now let's understand the basics
 bacchon se judi sabhi yojanaayen yaa to equity yaa rin bazaar yaa donon main nivesh karti hai
 Debt market means investing in bonds and debentures issued by the Government of India and companies
 vyaktigat haisiyat main ham equity or rin yojanaon main sidhe nivesh kar sakate hai
 We can buy equity directly from the stock market, take government bonds or debentures of companies and deposit our money in fixed deposit schemes of banks
 iske alaava post offis main rashtriya bachat patr, kisaan vikaas patr, lok bhavishya nidhi jaisi yojanaayen bhi hai, jo vastav main rin yojanaayen hai
 Those who do not have the skills, intelligence and time to invest in equity or debt market can choose only mutual fund schemes
 ye yojanaayen khud rin yaa equity yaa donon main nivesh karti hai
 After all, why am i insisting that you do this work yourself? One reason is that investing on the cost basis itself is more beneficial than schemes made specifically for children
 iskaa doosraa sabase bada phayda yah he ki aap apni jarurat ke hisaab se nivesh main pherbadal kar sakate hai
 New and better investment opportunities are always coming
 isliye apana sara paisa ek hi yojana main lagane kii bajaay vikalp khule rakhane main hi aklmandi he
 There is another aspect to it
 kai baar logon kaa apane upar anushaasan nahin rahata or ve niyamit nivesh main laaparvaah ho jate hai
 If this is the case with you, then you should only invest in schemes related to children
 bacchon ke bhavishya ke liye dhan jamaa karne main aapse koi chook nahin hogi
 You can also name mutual fund schemes, bonds and fixed deposit schemes, in which you keep depositing money for your child's education
 maine kai logon ko aisa karne kii salaah di he
 Virat and Nandita are unable to remain disciplined in regular investment
 unhone equity plan ko darshit shiksha yojana naam de diya or yah tarkeeb bahut kaamyaab rahi
 Now they never fail to deposit money in the shown education scheme because they know that they are depositing money for the future shown of their son
 is tarah unhen bhaavnaatmak aashwasti rahati he
 By the way, parents never get rid of anxiety
 hameshaa tarah-tarah ke sawaal sir uthaate rahete hai
 Will the money we are accumulating be enough? Should we teach our children how to collect and manage money? The best way to stay away from this worry is to invest regularly
 akasar mata-pita mujhase yah sawaal karte hai, ''bacchon ko paise or banking ke tareeke sikhaane kii sahi umr kya he?” meraa ek hi jawaab hota he, ''unhen shopping mal le jane se ek din pehle
 "I never understand that parents are never worried while taking their children to the market, but are hesitant to send them to the bank
 unka tark hota he ki shopping kii vajah se unka dhyaan kabhi padhai se nahin bhatakegaa, lekin agar bank bheja yaa paisa sanbhaalanaa sikhaaya to bacchon kaa dhyaan bhatak saktaa he or ve laaparvaah ho sakate hai
 There are many activities related to handling money, which i am doing with my daughter and ask my clients to do the same
 bahut choti umr main apane bachche ko ek jaar den or uskaa naam rakhen—chocolate bank
 Tell the children that whatever chocolate they get, keep it in the bank and eat it once or twice a week
 isse do baaten hongi
 One, the children's eating habits of chocolate will be curbed and secondly they will be able to see that by adding chocolate in the jar, the number increases and decreases on eating
 isse bade hokar unhen bachat or kharch kaa fark samajhnaa aasaan ho jayega
 My daughter's birthday is on the 18th
 har maheene kii 18 taarikh ko use ek uphaar kharidne kaa mauka miltaa he
 There is complete discipline from both sides in this work
 ham kabhi 18 taarikh nahin bhoolatey or agar us taarikh ko hamen shahar main nahin hona he to use pehle hi uski pasand kii cheez dilaa dete hai
 She also does not insist on the rest of the month
 agar use koi bada uphaar chahie to vah kuch maheene tak uphaar kaa paisa bachaa sakati he
 This helps the child to control his greed
 jab aap bacchon ko skool main kharch ke liye paise dena shuru karen to khud hameshaa hisaab rakhen or unase bhi hisaab rakhane ko kahen
 Keep in mind, if you do not keep track of your expenses, then your children will soon stop keeping accounts
 agar aap dhyaan se hisaab rakhte hai to bachche bhi sari jindagi aisa karenge
 When your child turns eight or nine years old, open a recurring account in a bank in his name
 shuruyaat choti rakam se karen
 Let him go to the bank, fill the deposit slip, deposit the money, let the slip be stamped and see that the correct entry is made in the passbook
 dhyaan rakhen ki bank janaa bhi utana hi aasaan ho, jitna ki dukaan yaa mal main janaa
 Now it is my daughter's responsibility to update the passbooks of some of our bank accounts regularly
 ek din vah mere 71 saal ke pita ko samaj rahi thi ki bank main ek nai mashin ai he
 She puts the passbook in the machine, the machine automatically turns the page and gives all the transactions a date-wise impression
 main dekh rahaa tha ki mere pita ko kitna garv ho rahaa tha
 The next moment he put his hand in his pocket and got fifty rupees
 kaa ek note uske haath main rakhte hue bole, ''jaao apane liye chocolate kharid lo
 There is no need to deposit this chocolate in your chocolate bank
 abhi kha sakati ho
 "I jokingly quipped," You are teaching black money
 ”jab aap bacchon ko skool main kharch ke liye paise dena shuru karen to khud hisaab rakhen or unase bhi hisaab rakhane ko kahen
 Keep in mind, if you do not keep track of your expenses, then your children will soon stop keeping accounts
 agar aap dhyaan se hisaab rakhte hai to bachche bhi sari jindagi aisa karenge

 The military exercise will be far from the Line of Control (loc) currently standing at the mouth of tense and conflict with Pakistan, but not far from Doklam, where India and China had a 72-day military standoff in 2017
 sena pramukh general bipin ravat or unke sipahasaalar is abhyaas ko bahut dhyaan se dekhenge kyonki is dauraan kai aisi chizon kaa pareekshan hona he jiske liye unhone maheenon tak kaam kiya he

 sena pramukh ne kaha, ''koi bhi yuddh main nahin janaa chahega, lekin agar (sthiti) haath se baahar nikalne lage to ham kuch simit karrwai karne main sankoch nahin karenge
 "getting out of hand" is a clear reference to the act of serious provocation
 udhaaharan ke liye, seemaa paar se hone vaala ek aisa aatanki hamalaa jisamen bade paimaane par jaan-maal kaa nuksaan ho
 General Rawat accepts that the enemy is 'unpredictable' and if you look at the statements coming from Pakistan these days, 'unexpected' would be a very restrained word
 sena pramukh ko ummid he ki agle chaar se paanch saal main pakistan ke saath lagati pashchimi seemaa par kareeb ek darjan ibiji taiyaar rahenge
 They will be used for quick response
 ibiji kaa uddeshy he shatru kii suraksha vyavastha ko dhwast karte hue kuch hi ghanton main shatru kii seemaa main ghus janaa, na ki pehle kii tarah seemaa paar ghusane main kuch din lenaa

 abhi haal tak sena sundarji siddhant ke tahat karrwai karti thi
 This principle was established by this former army chief in the 1980s: seven defensive corps and three aggressive 'offensive' corps deployed along the Pakistan border be brought from the interior of the country
 lekin sundarji siddhant main pehali khami 2001 main najar ai
 After the terrorist attack on Parliament in December 2001, it took more than 20 days for the army to deploy its 'attacking' corps

 The Cold Start doctrine, introduced in 2004, aimed to deploy eight divisions of equal size to an IBG on the border, aiming to carry out cross-border attacks for limited targets such as terrain capture
 lekin dar tha ki zyada andar tak hamalaa karne par pakistan parmaanu hamalaa kar saktaa tha
 However, these plans were never implemented until General Rawat became the army chief in 2016
 yahaan tak ki cold start ke kai yuddhayaason ke baad bhi sena ne ibiji kaa gathan nahin kiya
 General Rawat believed that he should be permanently stationed as a unified unit near the border and that the unit should be equipped with all military equipment, including artillery, combat engineers and signaling units

 After getting the status of Tiger State in Madhya Pradesh, the entire Kamal Nath government was engaged in patting its back
 akhabaaron main siem kamalnath ke bade bade vigyaapan aae the
 But after getting the status of Tiger State, the BJP has raised questions on the death of 3 tigers and called the government shameless to take credit on the status of Tiger State
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne do din pehle hi desh bhar main baaghon kii sankhya ke aankade jari karte hue madhyapradesh ko 526 baaghon ke saath tiger state kaa darja diya tha
 Years later, the government of the state got so proud of the status of the Tiger State that it gave the credit of this honor to itself by advertising in newspapers
 madhyapradesh kii rajdhani bhopal kaa shaayad hi aisa koi akhbaar hoga jisamen sarkaar ne vigyaapan dekar tiger state kaa darja milane kaa dhol na peeta ho
 But at the time when the status of Tiger State was getting printed in the newspapers of Kamal Nath, the head of the state, at the same time pictures of tigers were being killed in Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh
 darasal, bandhavgarh neshnal park main 2 dinon main 3 baaghon kii maut ho gai he
 These deaths occurred when Madhya Pradesh has been given the status of Tiger State 3 days ago
 bandhavgarh tiger rigerv main ek baghin, uske nau maah ke shaavak or ek anya baagh ke shav mili he
 Not only this, BJP has attacked the government by releasing the figures of tiger deaths in the last 7 months
 aath maheene main 20 baaghon kii mautbijepi kaa kahana he ki kamalnath sarkaar ke aane ke baad se ab tak madhyapradesh main kul 20 baaghon kii maut ho chuki he
 In response to a question asked by former minister and BJP MLA Vishwas Sarang about the death of tigers in the assembly, the government itself has said that 17 tigers died in Madhya Pradesh from December 2018 to 27 June 2019
 inamen se 3 baaghon kii maut shikaar kii vajah se hui jabaki 5 baaghon kii maut karant lagane se hui he
 The rest of the tigers died due to mutual fighting or natural causes
 vahiin tiger state kaa darja milane ke baad 3 or baagh mar gaye
 After which the tiger death toll in the Kamal Nath government has reached 20
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki tiger state kaa darja unki sarkaar kii vajah se mila lekin congress sarkaar vigyaapan dekar iskaa jhootha credit le rahi he
 Vishwas Sarang said that this is shameless of the government

 The AAP gave this answer in return for my question in the Legislative Assembly and three tigers died after the day Tiger State was declared
 aap apni peeth thapthapa rahe hai, mukhyamantri ke vigyaapan chhap rahe hai
 The number of tigers has increased after 2003, so it is the effort of the Bharatiya Janata Party government because increasing tiger numbers is not a task of two to four months, it is a process

 Umang Singhar, forest minister in the Kamal Nath government, says that one of the major reasons for the death of tigers is the fighting in the area, which the government is trying to reduce by increasing the area
 umang singhar ne kaha ki dekhie credit lene vaali koi baat nahin he
 i want to say that if wildlife is associated with our ecosystem, then there is nothing to take credit in it

 pakistan ke purv captain imran khan kaa maananaa he ki sachin tendulkar ko pichley saal bharat ke vishwa cap jeetne ke baad cricket se sanyas le lenaa chaiye tha
 Imran said that we all want to leave the game with great achievement but this is not always possible
 sachin ke liye vah pal vishwa cap jeetna tha
 He played well in the World Cup
 vah mahaan khilaadi he or uskaa koi vikalp nahin
 He said that he has to decide for himself when to say goodbye to the game
 australia se 4-0 se haarane ke baad to nahin janaa chahega
 There is no better thing if he retires from cricket after the World Cup
 imran ne kaha ki bhartiya khilaadiyon ko sanyas ke bare main khud faisla lene kaa haq he or prabandhan ko pehle unke vikalp talashne honge
 He said that it is a difficult question for the players when they will retire, it is a very difficult decision
 imran ne kaha ki bhartiya cricket main ek nahin balki teen yaa chaar aise khilaadi he
 The important question is their choice
 yuva or anbhavi khilaadiyon ke bich lanbaa antaraal ho to umradraj khilaadiyon ko team main rakhana padataa he
 Regarding Tendulkar's much-awaited hundred international century, he said that statistics do not matter for great players
 unhone kaha ki ricard tuutane ke liye banate hai
 Nobody plays to make a record
 ricard jeet kaa hissaa hote hai, sachin mahaan khilaadi he

 unhone kaha ki meri najar main mahanatam cricketer viv richards hai
 i do not need to see his record
 vah mahaan isaliye hai kyonki unhen chunautiyaan pasand thi
 There are only record figures that do not matter to great players
 imran ne kaha ki yadi unki team bharat kii tarah videsh main sharmnaak paraajay jhelti to vah khel ko alavida kah dete
 He said that i would retire
 yadi main aisi team main hum jo lagaataar aath test haar chuki he to main khel hi chhod detaa

 Congress President Shahul Gandhi is now reaching the public of Rajasthan after performing road show in Madhya Pradesh, where he will participate in different election programs on 9 and 10 October
 rahul apane daure kii shuruyaat mukhyamantrivasundhara rajeke gadhdholpurse karenge
 It is being told that Rahul Gandhi will cover all the four assembly seats of the district during his road show, which will start from Dholpur and Rahul's convoy will go to Mahua
 yah road sho kareeb 150 kilometre kaa bataaya ja rahaa he, jisamen rahul party kaaryakartaaon se lekar aam janata tak pahunchenge
 Rahul has visited Rajasthan only twice in the last two months, but now that everyone has come into election mode, it is also considered very important for Rahul to start an election campaign from Vasundhara's stronghold
 kya he kaarykram?congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi rajasthan ke 5 jilon kii 2 din kii yatra par kal dhaulpur pahunch rahe hai
 The Chief Minister will start his road show from Dhaulpur, the home of Vasundhara Raje and reach Dausa district via Bharatpur
 mangalvaar soobah kareeb 11:30 baje rahul gandhi dilli se dhaulpur ke mania aaenge
 At 11:40 Nukkad will address the gathering in Mania and then start their road show by boarding the bus
 150 kilometre lambey road sho main ek darjan choti or do badi jansabhaon ko rahul gandhi sambodhit karenge
 There is also a meeting of Rahul Gandhi in Baseri and Gulabpur of Dholpur
 iske baad bayana ke raste bharatpur jile main pravesh karenge or vahaan se dausa ke mahua main aakar raat ko 8:00 baje apana road sho khatm karenge
 Vasundhara Rajem is the Empress of Dholpur, Chief Minister and BJP leader Vasundhara Raje Scindia has an old relationship with this district
 gwalior rajgaraane kii beti vasundhara raaje kii shaadi dhaulpur ke raja hemanth singh se hui thi
 Though the two separated shortly after their marriage in 1972, Vasundhara did not leave Dholpur and became the queen of the place, receiving public affection
 yahaan tak ki vasundhara raane ne apane raajnneetik kariyar kaa aagaaj bhi isi dhaulpur se kiya, jab 1985 main unhone pehali baar dhaulpur seat se vidhansabha chunaav ladaa or jeet bhi darj kii
 The political equation of Dhaulpur falls in Dhaulpur district Bharatpur division and has a total of 4 assembly seats, out of which 3 seats are for general category, while 1 seat is reserved for Scheduled Castes (SC)
 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress 2 siton par jeet mili thi
 Whereas BJP and BSP got 1-1 seats
 aisa tab tha jabaki puure rajya main congress 200 main se mahaj 21 seat hi jeet pai thi
 More than 90 percent of the district's population is Hindu, while it has about 6 percent Muslim population
 anusuchit jati 20 or anusuchit janajati kii aabaadi kareeb 5 fisadi he
 Apart from Brahmins, Kushwahas, Gujjar and Rajput votes also play a decisive role
 basapa bhi factormadhya pradesh kii seemaa se sate dhaulpur main essi voton kaa khaasaa prabhaav he, jiske chalate bahujan samaaj party ko bhi yahaan jeet milti rahi he
 In the 2013 elections, the BSP received more than 1 lakh votes (23%) in all the four seats of the district and the party was third
 jabaki congress ko yahaan sabase zyada 36% vot va bijepi ko 32% vot praapt hua tha
 Talking about the Dholpur seat, BL Kushwaha won from here on the BSP ticket
 lekin katl kii sajeesh rachane ke aarope main disambar 2016 main biel kushvaha ko umrakaid kii sajaa sunai gai or kushvaha kii patni shobhaarani bijepi main shaamil ho gayi
 In 2017, Shobharani contested the BJP ticket by-election and won
 2008 ke chunaav main bhi is seat par bispi ne kadi chunauti di thi or vah congress se 700 vot va bijepi se kareeb 2 hajaar vot se pichad gai thi
 Apart from Dhaulpur, the BSP had also done well in the Basedi seat in the 2013 elections and got 26 percent vote share while staying at number three
 jabaki bijepi ko 36 or congress ko 35 pratishat vot mila tha
 BSP was also at number three in Rajkheda seat
 aise main congress ke saath gathbandhan na karne kaa basapa supremeo mayawati kaa faisla, dhaulpur jile ke nattejey prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Perhaps this is the reason why in view of the weakness of BJP in Dholpur, Rahul is coming here to burn life to overcome the BSP factor
 Holi 2019:rangon kaa tyohaar holi bas kuch hi din dur he
 Everyone is very excited about this festival
 har saal holi kaa tyohaar bahut dhooma-dham se manaaya jaataa he
 Holi festival is incomplete without colors
 is din sabhi log ek duusare ko khaas-taur par rang lagaate hai
 If Holi is a festival, it is natural to apply color and apply it, but if you do not take care of your skin on this occasion, then you may face a lot of problems later
 ham aapako kuch tips bataa rahe hai, jo holi ke chemical yukt rangon se aapaki skin ko surakshit rakhenge or holi ke ziddee rangon ke dhabbe bhi skin par nahin padenge
 Do not forget to apply oil - if you apply almond oil on your skin before playing Holi, then any color will not last long on your skin and will also go away easily
 bataa den, baadam ke tel main vitamin i kii maatra bhi adhik hoti he, jo aapaki twachaa ke liye laabhadaayak hota he
 Apply oil to your hair - similarly before playing Holi, apply coconut oil to your hair properly

 gujarat ke gir abhayaarany se acchhee khabar ai ki sirf isi ilaake main paae jane vaale babbar sheron yaa aciatic sheron kii sankhya main pichley paanch saalon main baari ijapha hua he
 The number which was 411 in the year 2010 has now increased to 523
 mahatvapurn baat yah he ki ek samay jo sher sirf gir abhayaarany ke 1,400 varg kilometre ke ilaake main paae jate the, ve ab gujarat ke aath jilon - junagarh, gir-somnath, amarelli, bhavnagar, botad, rajkot, jamnagar or porbandar - ko milakar 22,000 varg kilometre ilaake main paae jane lage hai
 Sandeep Kumar, the Deputy Conservator of the Gir Sanctuary, says, “it would be wrong to say that lions are spreading to new areas
 
 
 darasal, hakeekat yah he ki ve apane puraane ilaakon ko waapas le rahe hai
 
 
 According to the available information, in the 19th century, these Babbar lions were found in areas other than Gujarat, Rajasthan, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and up to present Pakistan, but gradually disappeared from these areas and by the 20th century
 They were reduced to just 1,400 square kilometers in the area of geer Sanctuary in Junagadh
 
 
 " Till 1990, these lions were generally found in the same Gir Sanctuary, but since then they have been continuously spreading in new areas
 isamen sabase zyada ijapha pichley paanch saalon main hi hua he
 In the year 2010, they were counted in an area of about 10,000 square kilometers, which has increased to 22,000 square kilometers this time
 nakshe main gir abhayaarany ke neeche kii ore, yaa kahen ki dakshin main samudr kaa ilaaka he, isliye ve zyaadaatar uttar, pashchim or purv ke ilaakon main hi fail rahe hai, lekin teji se badhate is ilaake ne van vibhaag ke saamne nai chunautiyaan bhi khadi kii hai
 So while increasing the number of lions is a matter of great pleasure, due to the increase in the area, the need to make many new arrangements is also being felt
 inamen rescue oparation kii kshamta, jaankaree badhanaa, jaanwaron ke saath kaise nibhaayaa jaae, is bare main logon main jagriti laana or saath main nae ilaake aane se sheron ke prajnan main bhi vruddhi hogi to uskaa bhi intjaam karnaa shaamil hai

 Importantly, according to experts, if the process of moving of lions to new areas continues unabated, then in future, the lion can be seen living in the natural environment outside Ahmedabad and even beyond Gujarat

 gir abhayaarany ke up-sangrakshak sandip kumaar kehete hai, "yah kahana galat hoga ki sher nae ilaakon main fail rahe hai
 
 
 Actually, the reality is that they are taking back their old territories
 
 
 uplabdh jaankaree ke mutabik 19veen sadi main ye babbar sher gujarat ke alaava, rajasthan, dilli, uttar pradesh, bihar or maujuuda pakistan tak ke ilaakon main paae jate the, lekin dhire-dhire in ilaakon se ve gaayab hote gaye or 20veen sadi aate-aate ve sirf junagarh ke gir abhayaarany ke ilaake ke 1,400 varg kilometre main simatakar rah gaye
 
 
 " varsh 1990 tak ye sher amuman isi gir abhayaarany main paae jate the, lekin uske baad se ve nirantar nae ilaakon main fail rahe hai
 The maximum increase in this has taken place in the last five years only
 varsh 2010 main kareeb 10,000 varg kilometre ilaake main inaki gananaa hui thi, jo is baar badhkar 22,000 varg kilometre tak ja pahunchi he
 The map has a sea area downstream of the Gir Sanctuary, or to the south, so they are mostly spreading in the north, west and east areas, but this rapidly growing area also poses new challenges to the forest department
 Are of so, jahaan sheron kii sankhya badhanaa behad khushi kii baat he, vahiin ilaake main badhotaree kii vajah se kai nae intjaam karne kii zarurat bhi mahasoos kii ja rahi he
 These include the ability to conduct rescue operations, increase information, awakening people on how to live with animals, and also arranging for the breeding of lions if new areas come along
 tippaniyan That is why the Chief Minister of the state, Anandiben Patel has instructed the Forest Department to work with the Forest Department along with irrigation (to provide water facilities) and also the revenue department
 mahatvapurn baat yah bhi he ki jaankaron ke anusaar, agar sheron ke nae ilaakon main jane kaa silsilaa yun hi berokatoke badhata rahaa to aane vaale vakt main babbar sher ahmedabad or usase bhi aage tak gujarat ke baahar bhi prakritik vaataavaran main rahete dekhe ja sakenge
