 It is interesting that while an OBJP is talking about taking along with him, BJP activist Bhola Singh of Begusarai was absent from Amit Shah's activist rally
 bataaya jaataa he ki bholaa singh apni bahu ke liye baiwara se tikat chaahate the, lekin tikat nahin milane se vah naaraaz chal rahe hai
 However, sensing the urgency of the occasion during the rally, Amit Shah appealed to the leaders not to give up their anger

 On the other hand, Union Minister Giriraj Singh took a dig at Bhola Singh's absence and said, 'some of Bhola Babu's wishes have not been fulfilled, so he is running angry

 8 november 2016 bharat or america ke liye behad ahm tha

 But if we look at the data of Dow Jones, the leading index of the US stock market during this one year, then the visible story of American business tells the opposite story

 The political atmosphere is also hot on the release of the film before the Lok Sabha elections

 All opposition parties including the Congress are questioning the timing of the film
 yaa bhi maang hui ki piem narendra modi ko chunaav ke nattejey aane tak relies na kiya jaae
 In a conversation with Aaj Tak, Vivek Oberoi clarified all the allegations against PM Narendra Modi
 actor ne film par jari virodh ko galat bataaya
 On the question regarding the timing of the film in the panel discussion, Vivek Oberoi said, "I feel that while the court has no problem, the Election Commission has no problem and according to the constitution, i have a fundamental right to make a film
 
 main jo, jab chahta hum tab banaaun or mere vyler jab chahen use dekhen
 i think no one should question me
 "sirf chunavi phaayde ke liye 39 din main film shoot kar lene ke sawaal par vivek ne kaha, "ye painic nahin effective mod he
 The view is there
 aap kisi se ye to nahin poochhate hai ki id par pikchar kyon relies kar rahe hai

 So why are asking me that i am releasing the film on Election
 "vivek ne saafe karne kii koshish kii ki ye film kisi kii vandana yaa bhakthi ke liye nahin banaai gai he
 On this question, Congress leader and actress Nagma present in the discussion said, "we have to protect the Constitution
 ham freedom of expressant ke kabhi khilaaf nahin rahe hai
 i think it is not right to release such a film (PM Narendra Modi) at such a time

 With the assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh remaining for about two months, this time the election is looking very thorny
 pandrah varshon main pehali baar congress kadi takkar detii najar aa rahi he, haalanki puraane mudde ab bhi uskaa peechha nahin chhod rahe hai
 For 14 consecutive years, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, fondly called Mama in the state, has remained a big face for the BJP
 lekin unke vidhayakon ke bare main yah baat lagu nahin hoti jo congress ke liye sahaayak sabit hote dikhte hai
 The latest challenge for the BJP is seen standing from the forward and backward castes
 ve is saal essi / asti kanoon (atyaachaar nirodhak) main sanshodhan ko bhaajapa kaa samarthan milane ke kaaran party se naaraaz hai
 Especially the upper caste castes living in the cities have always voted for the BJP
 isi tarah pichhadi jatiyon kaa ek bada hissaa bhi bhaajapa kaa voter rahaa he jiskaa mukhya kaaran madhya pradesh main party kii ore se obisi mukhyamantriyon—uma bharti, babulal gaur or shivaraj singh chouhan—kii niyukti rahi he
 But given the possibility of some votes slipping towards the NOTA or anti-reservation SAPAKS (SPX) party, the party may be at a disadvantage
 essi, asti kanoon main sanshodhan ke virodh ke alaava savarna or pichhadi jatiyaan sarkari naukariyon main kota die jane se bhi naaraaz hai
 But the BJP hopes that on the basis of the duplicity in the policy — backward castes can get reservation in jobs but not promotions — it can maintain the support of backward castes
 jahaan tak savarna jatiyon kaa sawaal he, use puraa vishwaas he ki unka vot usee ko milegaa, kyonki unke paas koi doosraa vikalp nahin he, thik musalamaanon kii tarah jinke saamne madhya pradesh main congress ke alaava koi or vikalp nahin he
 Former Chief Minister Babulal Gaur says, “forward castes will not go against BJP
 unke paas koi vikalp nahin he
 Similarly, Public Relations Minister Narottam Mishra says, "they (savarnas) are our voters, we will convince them by bowing their heads before the elections
" ''mukhyamantri chouhan ne balaghat main bilkul yahi kiya
 He said, "no case (under SC-ST law) will be registered against anyone without investigation
 '' is par congress ke netaa kapil sibbal ne kaha, "shivaraj singh chouhan ne ek bayaan diya he
 But laws do not change with statements
 ''ajeeb baat he ki bhrashtachar, jo janata kii raay main sarkaar main har taraf vyaapt he, is baar chunavi mudda nahin he
 Congress is also not making this an issue
 isi tarah congress berogari ko lekar bhi koi ho-hallaa nahin machaa rahi he
 In the last ten years, seats for engineering and other professional courses have increased in a big way
 lekin digriyaan hasil karne ke baad chaatro ko naukariyaan nahin mil paa rahi hai, jiske kaaran berozegaron kii fouj khadi ho gai he
 State Congress President Kamal Nath says, "an unprecedented situation has arisen in the state
 yahaan yuva, mahilaayein, essi, asti or kisaan khud ko thaga mahasoos kar rahe hai
 "but even understanding the issue, Congress leaders have not been able to take political advantage of it
" duusari taraf rajya sarkaar is samasya ko hal karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 This year around 30,000 teachers are being recruited

 Electricity supply is also an issue in some paddy cultivated areas, especially in eastern Madhya Pradesh
 pashchimi hisse main kisaan soyabean kii acchhee keemten na milane se naaraaz hai jabaki madhya pradesh desh main soyabean ke utpaadan main sabase aage he
 Hanuwant Singh, a farmer from Lalgarh in Ujjain district, says, "soybean prices have come down by almost half as compared to earlier and this year the prices may go down further due to huge increase in their yield
 bhavantar yojana se vyapaariyon ko phayda hua he na ki kisaanon kaa
 In Mandsaur, where the farmers' movement turned violent in 2017, the farmers have not yet forgiven the government
 congress netaa us mudde ko jivit rakhane ke liye niyamit rup se ilaake main daura karte rahete hai
 Farmers' movements usually occur during relatively free time between crops
 isliye bhaajapa kharif kii fasal katane or rabi kii buaai ke bich chunaavon se pehle ke maheenon main vishesh rup se satark rahegi
 At that time, adequate supply of electricity and fertilizer will be very important so that there will be no resentment among the farmers just before the elections
 is bich krishi ko zyada phydemand banane ke liye party gehun or dhan ke liye bonus bhugtan kii baat kar rahi he
 Crop insurance payment was also given last month, although some farmers complained that it was not enough
 1 april se sambal yojana bhi lagu kii gai he jisamen asangathit kshetra ke shramikon ko kai tarah ke laabh die jate hai
 These include maternal health and education to children and Rs 4 lakh on death
 kaa muaavja or bijli ke bilon ko maaf karnaa evam 200 ru
 2 in 2 karod logon ko bijli kaa conection dena shaamil he
 Apart from all this, the BJP hopes that its position will be strengthened by the Prime Minister campaigning, as the party feels that Modi's popularity is intact despite demonetisation, GST and Rafale
 chouhan ne kai maheenon se 2018 ke chunaav ko khud ke or congress kii ore se mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar ke bich jang kaa mudda banane kaa prayaas kiya he
 According to the India Today TV show "political Stock Exchange", Chauhan (46 per cent) is more than all the candidates for the Chief Minister's post from Congress, Jyotiraditya Scindia (32 per cent), Nath (8 per cent) and Digvijay Singh (2 per cent)
 Are popular
 congress ke paas mukhyamantri pad kaa koi cheharaa na hone se use phayda hi he
 But if the Congress declares a candidate, Chauhan will not delay in making it a presidential style election
 congress chunaav se pehle bahujan samaaj party (basapa) se gathbandhan kii ummid kar rahi he
 However, on 20 September, the list of 22 candidates was announced by the BSP chief Mayawati
 kamalnath kehete hai, "ham bhaajapa virdohi voton ko bantane se rokane ke liye basapa se baatcheet kar rahe hai
 "congress is still embroiled in the old problems of the organization
 har netaa kii alag media team he jo keval usee kii khabaren detii he
 But unlike the last few elections, this time the party's election campaign definitely shows some signs of planning and different leaders have been given different tasks

 Two things are evident from the Delhi Municipal Corporation results
 pehali yah ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon se shuru hui modi lahar kaa jalawaa abhi bhi barkaraar he
 Secondly, the Kejriwal government, which came to power two years ago after winning 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi, has lost its sheen
 haalanki yah bhi sahi he ki 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main modi lahar kaa jaadu nahin chalaa or arvind kejariwal jeetne main kaamyaab rahe
 It means that people wanted Arvind Kejriwal in power in Delhi but something has happened in these two years due to which the Aam Aadmi Party had to face a crushing defeat in its own stronghold
 tippaniyan This result is also important in that sense because the BJP had occupied the Delhi Municipal Corporation for the last 10 years
 bhrashtachar or badintjami kii vajah se logon main gussa bhi tha
 Its hallmark can be understood from the fact that the BJP has cut new seats for almost all the councilors and introduced new candidates

 Anyway, after seeing the results of the dream of coming to power in Punjab, you were disappointed

 This was also seen during the election campaign

 From the general public of the country to the petrol pump owners and the oil industry from June 16, such a change is going to be unprecedented
 16 june ke baad aapaki gadiyon main bhare jane vaale eendhan kii keemat har 24 ghante main badal jaaya karegi
 But petrol pump owners are not ready for this major change at any cost and are telling it another decision like demonetisation taken without preparation
 'jhagade kaa adda banenge petrol pump'petrol pump maalikon ne is masale par mangalvaar ko oil industry ke saath baithak bhi he
 Ajay Bansal, president of the Petrol Pump Owners Association, said that this step would be fatal without complete automation of all pumps across the country
 bansal ne kaha ki menuali mashin main nayaa rate daalane kii prakriya main puraa ek ghanta lagata he
 Now guess what those 11 of the night
 50 par petrol dalwane aaenge, jo ki aamtaur par thok main dijal lene vaale trek maalik hote hai, vah ek din pehle ke rate par dijal maangenge jabaki rate badal chukaa hoga
 This will make petrol pumps a quarrel of daily affairs
 sidhe company ke sarwar se juden panpessociation kaa kahana he ki jab tak sabhi petrol pump puri tarah computariced naa hon or vah sidhe company ke sarwar se naa jud jaaen tab tak yah karnaa thik nahin he
 Asked how long it will take, Bansal said that there are 56 thousand petrol pumps in the country and out of them only 10 thousand pumps are fully automated
 ab baaki bache 46 hajaar panpon ko automated karne main bahut vakt lagegaa
 Ajay Bansal, president of the American Petrol Pump Owners Association, said that the same system is prevalent in western countries that rates of petrol and diesel are reviewed daily but there is MRP system
 jahaan dealer comptishan ke hisaab ceret badha-gata bhi saktaa helekin yahaan ham retail outlet hai
 The company fixes the price and only petroids are to be sold on it
 jaahir he aise main agar sidhe company se petrol panpon main rate apadet nahin honge to margin mani kaa bhi nuksaan hoga
 From June 16, the strike association has clearly stated that if the government does not give any concrete solution after listening to their concerns, then all manual petrol pump owners will be forced to go on strike and in such a situation the automakers will also support them

 Whether they are sold in refill can or in small plastic pouches

 Because the low income section of the society uses it
 'kutir udyogon par badha tex'jayakumar kaa kahana tha ki palmira gud or palmira chini kutir udyog ke utpaada hai
 These are not mentioned separately in the provisions of GST
 iske chalate ye 18 fisadi tex kii shrenee main aa gaye hai

 kumaar ne council ko yaad dilaayaa ki wet grinder zyaadaatar coimbatore main banate hai
 The tax rate on them should be 18 percent instead of 28 percent
 'haath se bane gahane hon saste'jayakumar ne suzav diya ki sone ke aabhushanon ko hastnirmit or mashin nirmit shreniyon main baanta janaa chahie

 sunwaayee ke dauraan chunaav ayog kii taraf se kaha gaya kii nitish ne 2012 ke chunavi halafname main hatya kii exiaar kaa khulaasa kiya tha
 Earlier, the Election Commission has filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court saying that this petition is not hearable, it should be dismissed
 yachika 'tuchh' he or galat tathyon par aadhaarit he
 The information given in this is misleading and is an abuse of the court process

 isi tarah unhone 2013 main bhi bihar vidhaan parishad bhi chunaav nahin ladaa lekin pataa nahin yachikakarta emel sharma ne kahaan se nitish kumaar ke chunavi halafname hasil kar liye
 No fundamental rights of the petitioner have been violated in this case and Public Interest Litigation cannot be filed
 yachikakarta ko chunaav yachika yaa shikaayat police ko deni chahie thi
 This petition should be dismissed and the petitioner should be fined heavily
 gauratlab he ki vakil emel sharma ne yachika daakhil kar kaha he ki 2004 se 2015 ke dauraan nitish kumaar ne halafanaame main ye khulaasa nahin kiya ki 1991 main un par hatya ke maamle main exiaar darj hui thi
 Due to which Nitish Kumar cannot remain in constitutional post after concealing his criminal record
 ayog ne kaha ki niteesha kumaar ne 2012 or 2015 main bihar vidhansabha kaa chunaav nahin ladaa tha
 Similarly, he did not contest even the Bihar Legislative Council elections in 2013, but it is not known from where the petitioner ML Sharma obtained the election affidavit of Nitish Kumar
 is maamle se yachikakarta ke koi moulik adhikaron kaa hanan nahin hua he or janhit yachika daakhil nahin kii ja sakati
 The petitioner should have given the election petition or complaint to the police
 ye yachika khaarij kii jaae or yachikakarta par baari jurmaana lagaaya jaae
 It is to be noted that advocate ML Sharma has filed a petition saying that during 2004 to 2015, Nitish Kumar did not disclose in the affidavit that he had filed an FIR in the murder case in 1991
 jisase nitish kumaar apane aapraadhik record ko chupaane ke baad sanvaidhanik pad par nahin rah sakate hai

 com / dqgwyehq0b kendra sarkaar kii dedline ke mutabik sabhi karadaataaon ko 31 agast tak apane aadhaar or pan kii linking ko puraa kara lenaa hoga
 If a taxpayer has failed to link his PAN and Aadhaar till this period, his income tax return filed for the financial year 2016-17 will not be processed
 lihaaja, yadi aap 5 agast tak apana inakam tex ritern daakhil (ITR) kar chuke hai lekin aadhaar or pan kii linking karaane main safal nahin hue to ukt vitt varsh ke liye aapke ritern ko nahin mana jayega
 The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has stated that the stipulated deadline for taxpayers to link their PAN to Aadhaar will remain and this requirement will not be affected by the Supreme Court's decision on privacy
 yuidiai ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari (siio) ajay bhushan pandey ne kaha ki sarkari sabsidi, saamaajik yojanaon or anya laabhon kaa laabh lene ke liye aadhaar dene kii anivaaryta bhi philhal jari rahegi
 The government has extended the deadline for connecting PAN with Aadhaar to 31 August
 ucchtam nyaayalay ke faisle se aadhaar or pan ko jodne par kya asar hoga? yuaidi ke siio ne kaha, pan ko aadhaar se jodne ko iskar kanoon main sanshodhan ke jariye anivaary kiya gaya he
 This work will continue under the law
 isamen koi badlaav nahin hoga
 Also read: Now there will be no black money on Dalal Street, Aadhaar will monitor on behalf of the UID that whether it is under the provisions of Aadhaar law or under Income Tax law or Money Laundering law, different timelines have to be followed because these laws are valid Huh
 yuaidi ne bharosa jataayaa ki aadhaar kanoon apane data suraksha sefguard ke jariye niztaa ke moulik adhikaar ke tahat khara utrega
 It has also been said by the UID that nomination for Aadhaar will continue without any hindrance
 unhone kaha ki aadhaar kanoon main niztaa kii suraksha ke pehle se praavdhaan hai
 It does not share data without the consent of the person concerned
 ye he aadhaar-pan linking kaa aasaan tareekahaalanki aadhaar-pan linking kii aakhri taarikh ko 31 agast tak karnaa ek routine faisla he or is taarikh ke baad bhi desh main aadhaar or pan kii linking kaa kaam bhi kiya jayega
 Speaking on the last date of Aadhaar PAN linking, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has clarified that this linking work is a continuous process and as new PAN and Aadhaar are being created in the country, the linking work will continue
 ise bhi padhein:nahin file karte IT ritern, riject hone se bachaane ke liye karen PAN, AADHAR linkardd hue 11
 44 lakh PAN numbers, know the validity of your PAN, for those who do not have both these documents and do not have the benefit of banking and other business or central government schemes, this last date of linking does not matter
 yadi kisi aadhaar dharak ke paas pan nahin he to vah swechha se use banavaa saktaa he
 Why PAN card is important and linking with its new PAN card will make the PAN card verification of customers very easy for banks
 kuar code kii madad se ise mahaj chand secondon main puraa kiya ja sakegaa
 At the same time, the process of verification of the card holder in the old PAN card was extremely complicated and took longer
 gauratlab he ki desh main kaledhan par lagaam lagane or kendra sarkaar ke vikaas ke kaaryakramon se chori rokane ke liye pan or aadhaar kii linking behad jaruri he
 When i am a woman, Raanjana Jaiswalanai book publication, Rohini, Delhi-89, Price: Rs 200
 stri nahinkhilonaah ranjana jaiswalek stri stri baad main he manushya pehle
 Being a human, he certainly has many colors in his life
 par in rangon ke liye makul jagah uske paas nahin he
 he
 jbaati taur par apane aapako baar-baar rokatii he jabaki purush prakruti kii har choti-badi cheez ko sadhikaar grahan karata he
 Why does the woman not have this right, Ranjana Jaiswal does not revolt against the same destiny of woman in her poems
 jar aati hai
 The question of how women emerged from the patriarchal structure is found in each of their poems
 mardon kaa samaaj aurat ko jis prakaar se gadhana chahta he, aurat usee ke anuroop dhalati chali jaati he
 Poetry presents images of small and fresh experiences of life in his poems in earnest
 maaya nahin manushya or chachee isi prakaar kii kavitaayen hai
 Poetry turns out to be a woman's toy
 jis khilone se purush jab chahta he, prem karata he, jab chahta he, seva karwaata he or jab chahta he use peethta bhi he
 This hide-and-seek game continues unabated, the woman is tired by saving
 prem jivan main saugat kii tarah hota he or is prem ko praapt karne ke liye purush kai-kai baar mukt he jabaki aurat ko agar prem na mili to use bhagya kaa vidhaan maanakar chup rahanaa chahie
 i am the river, mouth burns, jury etc
 poems draw the same irony of woman
 sangrah main ek kavita he jalkumbhi
 Like water hyacinth, a woman tied to an anonymous hypnosis did not protect the family at all times with her green face
 jar aati he
 She covers the scattered again and again, but is also evicted first when the straw is moved around
 vahiin par kuchhek kavitaaon main unka komal stri man prem main samarpan kaa swaagat karata na
 Jar comes paramparaayen peechha nahin chhodtin or prayog kuch nayaa karne kii hausalaaf
 Let's do aadhunik stri beshak in chunautiyon kaa bhaar apane kandhon par lenaa chaahati he, prayogon kii srujanaatmakataa ke palon ko mahasoos karnaa chaahati he
 The identity of the woman is divided into different broken glass pieces due to some reasons
 ise kavyitri apni patangen kavita main vyakt karti haih patangen khud kuch nahin hotin, kahata rahaa samaaj, or main adi rahi stri patang nahin hoti
 Simone the Beauva states two important sentences in second sex: a woman is not born, is made; And financial freedom is the biggest freedom of women

 Throughout the book, Ranjana struggles with many questions
 ek sawaal yah bhi he ki purush to doosraa vivaah kar saktaa he, uskaa aadim ha
 Is a par stri paraye purush kii na
 It is also polluted by means
 punarvivaah kaa dussahas kare to pati chhodie, betaa hi diwaar ban jaataa he
 Ramratiya is a poem
 paanch bacchon kii maa he vah
 She ran away leaving her alcoholic husband and begging children
 use dine, kathkareji, aurat ke naam par kalank kaha gaya
 Everyone sympathizes with Ramratia's alcoholic husband
 mahadevi verma ne shrinkhalaa kii kadiyaan main likhaa he ki patit se patit purush bhi stri ke charitra kii samiksha karne kaa adhikaar rakhata he
 The same is the case with Ramratia, whose right to review the character rests with the patriarchal society
 ramaratiyaa charitraheen ghoshit kii jaati he
 In this way the human face of the woman is killed all the time
 yah kavita sangrah aise hi sawaalon kii saajhedaar pahal he

 Is it a sin for a girl to study after marriage? In Sirohi, Rajasthan, what did a girl give her 10th examination after marriage, everyone from the in-laws to the panchayat stood against her

 But this dream will become the biggest crisis of his life, he never thought
 sita kaa kahana he ki unke pati padhe-likhe nahin hai isliye wo or padhanaa chaahati thim
 He sought permission from his in-laws for the 10th standard, but was refused
 yahaan tak ki pati ne bhi sita kaa saath nahin diya
 After not getting the support of her in-laws for studies, Sita went to her maternal home and from there she took her Class 10 examination
 unka kahana he ki sasuraal ke saath-saath panchon ko bhi yah baat nagavar gujri

 Rating: 3 Stardirector: Shakun Batrakalakar: Fawad Khan, Siddharth Malhotra, Alia Bhatt, Rishi Kapoor, Rajat Kapoor and Ratna Pathakkaran Johar's specialty is to create stories about the complexities of urban life and its problems and relationships
 is baar bhi ve shakun batra ke saath milakar kuch aisa hi karte najar aate hai
 Every family has some secrets
 kuch kamiyaan hoti hai or kuch pareshaaniyaan hoti he, kuch khushiyaan bhi hoti hai
 The same is the Kapoor family, 'kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gum'
 shakun batra ne ek parivaar ko gadha he jo apni kamiyon or khaasiyaton ke saath saamne aata he
 The film is a new-age family drama
 shakun or riter aayshadevitre dhillon kii yah ek acchhee koshish he
 But despite the subject being good, in the case of the script somewhere it is prickling that clippings of happiness and sorrow are added
 kahani main kitna dam'kapur and sans' kii kahani do bhaaiyon fawaad khan or siddharth malhotra kii he
 He is also associated with the Kapoor family
 donon bhaaiyon ko apane dada kii tabiyat se judi khabar milti he to ve kunoor apane ghar pahunchate hai
 At the same time, he meets Alia Bhatt
 is tarah se rishton kaa nayaa taana-bana saamne aa jaataa he
 Dada Rishi Kapoorka's story also comes in between
 rajat kapur or ratna pathak bhi rishton ko lekar jujhate hue najar aate hai
 Overall, there is a story of the ups and downs of love, quarrels and emotions between a family
 jisamen do bhaaiyon ke bich ke alag-alag moods ko dikhaane kii koshish kii gai he chaahe vah jalan ho yaa phir bahut hi zyada pyaar
 However, at some places in the film, the attempt to force the comedy is clearly visible
 phir driving seat par duusare stearing vaala seen golmaal siries se udaaya gaya he
 Fawad Khan's acting in Star Appealfilm is Capabletarif
 unhone dikhaa diya he ki tivi par acting kar-kar ke apni kala main maharath hasil kar chuke hai
 He has screened every character of his character well
 duusare bhai siddharth malhotra kii acting ab bhi kaaphi kachi he
 They look smart on screen, but they still have to work hard in acting
 dada ke kirdaar main rishi kapur thik he, darshakon ko gudgudane kii kaaphi koshish bhi karte hai lekin unka mechap ankhon main khatkata he
 This much money was wasted
 ratana pathak or rajat kapoorto achche kalakaar hai hi
 The film also stars Alia
 unako zyada mauka nahin mila he or acting ke maamle main unhen ab bhi kaaphi papad belane hai
 Earn Ki Baat 'kapoor and Sons' is a family story and it is a film made entirely of soul for urban and multiplex audiences
 isamen fawaad or siddharth malhotra jaise screen par khubasurat dikhne jaise chehre hai or aalia bhatta bhi hai
 That is, there is a lot of effort to connect with the youth
 film kaa bajet 40-50 karod rupee ke bich bataaya ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, the film will have to work hard

 a huge piece of gold found years ago from Venezuela has been considered the world's largest gold body

 The 78 gram and size golf ball is so big
 miami vishvavidhyalay ke bhuvigyaani jon rakovan ne bataaya, 'sone ke itane bade pind ke bare main isse pehle kabhi adhyayan nahin kiya gaya, or hamaare paas ab aisa karne kaa avasar he

 What changed in West Bengal between 2011 and 2014? The Writers' Building changed color, the red color changed to blue and white
 badla to 2016 tak bhi nahin
 The Trinamool Congress got the chair instead of the CPI-M
 bengal nahin badla
 Bengal is not just Kolkata
 kolkata se baahar bankuda bhi he
 Veerbhum too
 veerbhum main shanti niketan bhi he or subalpur bhi
 Subalpur is not far from Shanti Niketan
 mukhya sadak se bain taraf mudane par ek nahar ke kinare-kinare jangal main dahini ore ek gaanv he
 Nothing has changed there instead that media people are not reaching the village anymore
 vahaan koi 2014 ke janvari maheene main hui ghatana ke bare main baat nahin karnaa chahta
 Whosoever talks, whispers
 aakhir lav jihad jaisaa masalaa fusfusaakar baat karne vaali cheez hi to he
 Bengal is the province of educated people
 lav jihad upi waalon kii viraasat he
 However, the truth is that the incident happened and happened in a disgusting manner
 ek janajaatiy ladki ko samudaay ke baahar ke ladke se pyaar ho gaya
 Consequently, the Salishi Sabha was convened
 salishi sabha yani janajaatiy panchayat, jise suvidha ke liye aap ilaake kii khap panchayat maan sakate hai
 It is also powerful like Khap
 bengal jaise rajya main khap? par sach yahi he
 However, in lieu of love, that tribal girl has a fifty thousand rupees
 kaa jurmaana thonk diya gaya
 The girl was poor, could not pay the fine, then on the orders of the head of the Salishi Sabha, twelve people raped the girl
 balaatkaar karne waalon main mukhiya mahoday bhi the
 When this matter came in the eyes of the media and there was a ruckus, then they were arrested later
 yah ghatana pashchim bengal main tab hui thi jab mukhyamantri pad par ek mahila thim
 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had given the slogan of Mother, Mati and Manush in her journey to power

 par aankade yahi bataate hai ki vidhi-vyavastha par mamata kii pakad badtar he
 The Subalpur case of Salishi Sabha is just one example
 usee daur main kai aisi ghatnaayen huin jinke liye mamata banerjee ko ek mukhyamantri ke taur par sharmasaar hona chahie tha
 Just count, in February 2012, in Kolkata's Park Street rape, Mamta called the rape false, Vardhman's rape was raped in front of her daughter, Chief Minister Mamta said: This is a false conspiracy
 peedita makapa kii sadasya he
 In December 2012, there was a gang rape in Barasat in North 24 Parganas, instead of the real rapist, the police arrested the brick kiln worker
 july, 2013 murshidaabad ke rani nagar main shaareerik rup se ashakt ladki kaa rape, aaropee tha trinmul kaa netaa-putr
 In October 2013, the gang rape of a minor in Madhyamgram in North 24 Parganas, the girl's family turns up in fear, the criminals chase her there too
 janvari, 2014 main dakshini kolkata ke fitness centre kii karmchaaree ko trek main agava kar liya jaataa he or 5 log uske saath rape karte hai
 In June 2014, a college student is raped and killed in Kamduni
 mukhaalafat par utari mahilaon ko mamata banerjee maovadi bataa detii hai
 This is a list of the rapes that came in the eyes of the media, and through the media, the public attention was received
 par 2014 ke aankade 2015 or 2016 main or bhayaavah hote jate hai
 The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data for the year 2016 point towards rising crime against women in West Bengal
 in aparaadhon main mahila taskari se jude badhate maamalon kii fehrist bhi he or yah khatarnaak trend he
 Experts say that in West Bengal politics, there are sharp statements
 par vahaan tejabi hamale bhi mahilaon ke khilaaf utane hi kargar dhang se istemaal main laae jate hai
 In 2016, the NCRB states
 desh bhar ke kul acid atake ke 283 main se 76 sirf bengal main hue
 That is 26 percent
 mahilaon ke khilaaf krurta ke desh bhar main 1,10,434 maamle darj kiye gaye hai or unamem se 19,305 maamle yani kareeb 17 fisadi sirf bengal main hue hai
 Bengal is not far behind in human trafficking and 44 per cent of the cases of human trafficking across the country are from Bengal itself
 2016 main desh bhar main kul 8,132 cese darj kiye gaye or bengal main yah 3,579 cese the
 Bengal has always retained its embarrassingly high position in crimes against women
 saal 2016 main, 32,513 maamalon ke saath mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadhon kii oonchi sankhya ke saath bengal main mahilaon ke khilaaf hone vaale aparaadhon kaa kareeb 10 fisadi (9
 6 percent)
 haalanki tark yah hoga ki is paaydaan par bhaajapa shasit uttar pradesh pehle paaydaan par he or pashchim bengal duusare paaydaan par, lekin bengal main desh kii kul mahila aabaadi kaa mahaj 7
 It is only 5 percent, while 17 percent of the country's women live in UP
 bengal main mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadhon ke oonchi dar ke baavjood prashasan ne ise lekar kuch khaas kiya nahin he
 The alarming thing is that neither the state government in West Bengal cares nor any election issue for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) challenging the Trinamool Congress
 rajya main pashchim bengal mahila ayog or pashchim bengal bal adhikaar sangrakshan ayog ne bhi is disha main kuch thos karne kii pahal nahin kii he
 The conviction rate in crimes against women in India is 18
 9 fisadi he, par haroonges tareeke se pashchim bengal main yah mahaj 3
 It is only 3 percent
 par hairat yah he ki, jaisaa maine shuru main kaha, siyasat main naare aage chalate hai tathy peeche chhutate jate hai
 Emotions are overwhelming and reality is sidelined
 bengal main mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadh par maine shanti niketan kii ek praadhyapika or kolkata main ek mahila patrkaar se tippanee chaahi, to donon ne ek hi jawaab ke saath bengal kaa bachaav kiyah aakhir aparaadh kis soobe main nahin hote?maine kaha tha na, siyasat main naare tathyon par baari hon to vaicharikta kii tech liye log uski himaayat main aaenge hi, bachaav main bhi

 seemaa par jawan shahid ho rahe hai or desh main pakora or bhajiya-talane kii raajnneetik charchaa jari he
 Saamna, presenting the figures in the article, said that Pakistanis have infiltrated and fired 100 times in the last one month
 hamaare 15 jawan shahid hue hai
 Will give a befitting reply to Pakistan, it is being said every day, but the ruling party is not getting the answer? Shiv Sena has praised former Prime Minister and Congress leader Indira Gandhi in the article
 lekh main kaha gaya he ki pakistan ko sabak sikhaane kii himmat congress party main nahin thi
 
 
 But Indira Gandhi defeated and partitioned Pakistan
 saahas kaa kaam us mahila ne tab kiya tha jab america- hindustan ke khilaaf pakistan ke samarthan main tha
 Taking a dig at the Prime Minister, the article said that today America is in Modi's pocket and nations like France, Germany, Israel shout on Modi's rhythm
 phir bhi pakistan or uske aatanki hindustan kii naadee kashmir main roj khol rahe hai
 The Shiv Sena has said that ideological pakodas are being fried because of the serious issues of the country
 kashmir main hamaare jawan roj shahid ho rahe hai
 At such a time, keeping people entangled in the discussion of pakora-bhajiya tells that the country is in serious crisis

 One cannot imagine that this is a matter between India and Italy
 ' Salman Khan, who is still struggling for a clean chit about his old cases in the court, is now seen getting caught in another new trouble
 khabar ai he ki film vir ke pradeusar vijay galani ne unke khilaaf 250 karod rupee kii manahani kaa daawa thoka he
 Vijay Galani has filed a defamation case against Salman for harassing him with the dues
 film vir kii shooting se pehle salmaan or vijay ke bich ek qaraar hua tha, jisamen vijay ne kaha tha ki yah film box offis par acha pradarshan karti he to vah salmaan ko 15 karod rupye denge
 Unfortunately this could not happen and the film was beaten at the box office
 ab aise main actor ko kathith rakam dene kii jarurat unhen mahasoos nahin hui
 But, on behalf of Salaman's office, the matter was raised in CINTAA and Federation of Western India Cine Association
 iske baad vijay galani ke khilaaf ek non-coppereshan letters bhi jari kar diya gaya
 The comments galani ne bataaya ki march 2010 main unhen salmaan ke offis se ek letters mila jisamen agreement dikhaane ki maang rakhi gai thi
 Salman reached the 'cine and TV Artists Association' with all the agreements and demanded more money, but the decision was made in favor of Galani
 salmaan ne 'federation of western india sine association' ke daravaaje bhi khatkhataaye, lekin galani ne saaf dikhaa diya ki unhen koi zyada profit nahin hua
 The court also called the representative of Salman and asked the same question on which basis he was asking for more money, while there was no profit
 iskaa unke paas koi jawaab nahin tha
 Meanwhile, producer Galani has filed a defamation case of Rs 250 crore against Salman Khan for defaming him and mentally torturing him for three years
 vijay galani ne salmaan dwaara bakaae fees ko lekar utpeedan karne ke liye unke khilaaf yah manahani kaa cese darj kiya he
 Before the shooting of the film Veer, there was an agreement between Salman and Vijay, in which Vijay said that if the film performs well at the box office, he will give Rs 15 crore to Salman
 durbhaagya se aisa ho na sakaa or film box offis par pit gai
 In such a situation, he did not feel the need to pay the alleged amount to the actor
 lekin, idhar salaaman ke offis kii taraf se CINTAA or federation of western india sine association main yah maamla uthaa diya tha
 After this, a non-cooperation letter was also issued against Vijay Galani
 tippaniyan Galani said that in March 2010, he received a letter from Salman's office demanding that the agreement be shown
 salmaan saare agreement lekar 'sine and tivi artists association' pahunch gaye or zyada rakam kii maang kii, lekin vahaan faisla galani ke haq main hua
 Salman also knocked on the doors of the Federation of Western India Cine Association, but Galani clearly showed that he did not make much profit
 court ne bhi salmaan ke ripregentative ko bulaakar yahi sawaal kiya ki kis aadhaar par wo zyada paise maang rahe the, jabaki munafa hua hi nahin tha
 He had no answer to this
 is dauraan produsar galani ne salmaan khan ke khilaaf unhen badnaam karne or teen saal tak maansik rup se pratadit karne ke liye 250 karod rupye kii manahani kaa cese kar diya he
 Unfortunately this could not happen and the film was beaten at the box office

 In relation to the question of what relation of 370 to Maharashtra, Kripa Shankar said that Maharashtra is no different from the country
 unhone kaha, 'pulavama main ghatana hui thi or jab balakot par air strike hua, tab hamaare netaaon ne pehle to saport kiya
 At that time, he supported Rahul Gandhi and then opposed it
 jabaki us samay desh main charchaa chal rahi thi ki bijepi 200 siton se aage nahin jaaegi
 On the question of Congress mlas joining BJP and Shiv Sena, he said, 'I think the Congress and NCP are not thinking seriously about why their mlas and ministers are leaving the party

 raksha mantri rajnath singh ne in dinon ienes vikramaditya kii yatra par hai
 While speaking to the media there, he said that the threat of a terrorist attack on the Indian coastline remains because the neighboring country is doing evil acts to destabilize India
 tatarekha par aatankwaadi hamale ke khataron par raksha mantri ne kaha, 'duniya main har desh ke paas apni raksha ke liye paryaapt suraksha honi chahie
 We cannot take any apprehension (threat of terrorism) lightly
 ' pakistan kii ore ishaara karte hue rajnath singh ne kaha, 'jahaan tak hamaare padosi desh kii baat aati he
 You know, he is constantly doing evil acts to destabilize and break India
 'rajnath singh raat bhar ienes vikramaditya main ruke or is dauraan unhone pandubbiyon, fregates or vaahak sahit vibhinn sainya abhyaason ko dekha
 He said, 'I can say with great confidence that our Indian Navy is firm and attentive here for maritime security
 isamen tanik bhi andeh nahin he
 With this, he said that an attack like Mumbai will not be allowed to recur
 rajnath singh ne kaha, 'ham 26 / 11 hamale ko bhul nahin sakate
 If a mistake is made once, it should not recur at any cost
 isliye hamaari bhartiya nausena or tat rakshak hameshaa satark rahete hai
 On the statement of the army chief about the militants re-entering into Pulwama, Defense Minister Singh said, "it is not necessary to tell anyone what will happen to the terrorists
" 'raksha mantri ne kaha ki na keval bharat balki puri duniya ko pataa he ki aatankwaadiyon kaa kya hoga
 Singh also did yoga on the aircraft carrier on Sunday morning
 unhone kaha ki keval bharat main hi nahin balki duniya bhar main logon ne yoga ko apanaaya he
 He said, 'yoga has gained international recognition and its credit goes to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 ' raksha mantri ne kaha, 'unhone sanyukt raashtra ke samaksh yoga par prastaav pesh kiya or iskaa 177 deshon ne samarthan kiya
 ' tamilnadu vidhansabha ne manoranjan klbon or anya sthanon par dhoti or anya paaramparik bhartiya paridhaan ke pahan kar jane par lage pratibandh ko hataane sambandhi vidheyak ko buudhvaar ko paarit kar diya
 Chief Minister j Jayalalithaa introduced the bill in the Assembly in view of the recent backdrop of controversy over not allowing a Madras High Court judge to wear a dhoti to a club in a TNCA club
 is vidheyak main kanoon kaa ulanghan karne vaale klbon kaa license radd karne or ek saal ke karawas kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan he
 The Speaker of the Legislative Assembly p Dhanapala declared the Tamil Nadu Public Place Entry (removal of Restrictions) Bill, 2014 by voice vote and this law came into force with immediate effect
 is kanoon main kaha gaya he ki kisi bhi manoranjan club, association, trust, company yaa socity ko aisa koi niyam, niyaman yaa up kanoon nahin bananaa chahie jo bhartiya samskruti ko parilakshith karne vaali dhoti yaa anya paaramparik paridhaan pahane kisi vyakti ke uske niyantran yaa prabandhan vaale saarvajanik sthal par pravesh par roak lagaataa he
 The act states that for violation of this, the license will be canceled and imprisonment for one year and additional fine of Rs 25,000
 vidheyak ke kaarnon or uddeshyon ke anusaar sarkaar ke sangyaan main yah laayaa gaya ki kuch club tamilnadu kii samskruti ko parilakshith karne vaali dhoti pahane logon ko apane niyantran vaale saarvajanik sthalon par pravesh se is aadhaar par roak rahe hai ki ve paashchaatya samskruti ko dhyaan main rakhkar vastra nahin pahan rahe hai or us sandarbh main maujuuda vidheyak ko pesh karnaa or paarit karnaa jaruri he
 Jayalalithaa had earlier assured the House that the law banning dhoti would be brought in the current session only when the opposition parties were not allowed to admit the dhoti-clad judge in a book release program at a club on 11 July last
 jammu-kashmir ke poonch sector main niyantran rekha ke paas kerani ilaake main pakistani sena kii ore se guuruuvaar ko bhartiya chaukiyon par kii gayi andhadhundh firing main do mahilaayein jakhmi ho gayin
 Pakistan's firing has also been retaliated by India
 raksha pravaktaa karnal aar ke palta ne bataaya ki pakistani thalsena ke javaanon ne guuruuvaar ko kareeb 12:05 baje poonch main agrim chaukiyon par chote or swachaalit hathiyaaron se firing kii
 The spokesman said that the firing from across the border forced the Indian jawans to retaliate and the firing was going on from both sides till the last notice
 poonch ke varisht police adheekshak (esaspi) shamsher ne bataaya ki 12 saal kii hasana or 32 saal kii nur jahaan pakistani sena kii ore se kii gayi firing main jakhmi ho gayi
 Reports said that Pakistani security forces opened fire on Indian forward posts in Kerani-1 and Kerani-two areas of Poonch sector
 jile main buudhvaar se lekar ab tak pakistan kii ore se sangharsh-viraam kaa ulanghan karne kii yah teesri ghatana he
 Significantly, since January 1 this year, the Pakistani Army has violated the ceasefire more than 80 times
 raksha mantri e ke antni ne haal hi main kaha tha ki niyantran rekha par sangharsh--viraam kaa ulanghan hone kii sthiti se nipatane ke liye thalsena ko puri chhot di gayi he
 Army Chief General Bikram Singh has also asked his commanders to take an aggressive stand on the ceasefire violation by the Pakistani Army
 bharat or pakistan ke bich hue kargil yuddh main bhale hi vijay bharat kii hui, par isane hamaari pratiraksha taiyaariyon or sahi vakt par sahi nirnay lene kii kshamta kii pole kholkar rakh di
 Many believed that the country would have suffered less if it had not been delayed to take important decisions during the Kargil war
 kai sainikon ko ganvaani padi janjun, 2004 main sattadhari congress party ne kargil yuddh ke samay sattashin endie sarkaar par aarope lagaaya ki kai mahatvapurn faisle lene main deree kii vajah se hamaare kai sainikon ko jaan ganvaani padi
 Citing a newspaper report, Congress leader Ashwani Kumar had alleged that the country's security was compromised, so it would be thoroughly investigated
 unka kahana tha ki endie sarkaar ne jis jaanch cameti kaa gathan kiya tha, uski report ko dabaa diya gaya
 The responsibility could not be fixed, but the Communist Party of Marxist, which was supporting the central government from outside, also sought to take action against those responsible in this matter, while uniting the Congress
 in aaropon ke jawaab bijepi ne kaha tha ki congress apane daagi mantriyon ko mantrimandal main shaamil karne se uthe vivaad se dhyaan bantane ke liye kargil kaa masalaa uthaa rahi he
 Overall, the result was 'dhak Ke Teen Pat'
 endie sarkaar ko mili clinchitsaal 2004 main tatkaaleen raksha mantri pranab mukherjee ne is bare main spashtikaran diya
 Giving 'clean chit' to the previous NDA government on this issue, he said that during the Kargil war neither the government nor the Air Force took any kind of sobriety
 baad main yah masalaa thanda pad gaya
 In the latest Lok Sabha elections, out of 29 Lok Sabha seats in Madhya Pradesh, Congress got only one seat
 is karaari haar ne mukhyamantri kamalnath ko baikfoot par laa diya
 Now he has a solid task to fulfill the promises made in the party's manifesto and improve the state administration
 haalanki, kamalnath centre main vibhinn mahakme sambhaal chuke hai par rajya sarkaar chalaane kaa yah unka pehla anubhav he
 One can see about 360 degree view of Kamal Nath Bhopal from the new office of the Ministry on the fifth floor of Vallabh Bhavan with sandstone covered walls
 aise hi ve puure rajya ko dekhnaa chahenge
 In an exclusive interview to Group Editorial Director (publishing) Raj Chengappa, Kamal Nath spoke about the results of the Lok Sabha elections, the leadership crisis in Congress, his agenda and imminent challenges for Madhya Pradesh
 kuch ansh:loksabhaa chunaav nateezon se bada jhatka laga hoga, congress ko madhya pradesh main sirf ek seat mili
 Should it be a mandate against the state government? No, the election results were entirely for the central government
 bhole se bhole matadaata ko bhi pataa tha ki yah chunaav centre kii sarkaar ke liye tha
 Just like in the assembly elections in which Narendra Modi campaigned loudly, the result was not the same, because the public knew that it had nothing to do with Modi
 isi tarah, ve jaanate the ki loksabhaa chunaav modi se judaa he or rajya sarkaar se iskaa koi taalluk nahin he
 Did you not think of resigning and taking a new mandate due to the bad defeat of your party in Madhya Pradesh? Absolutely not because my government was sworn in on December 25 and i got just 75 days to show my work
 aachaar samhita lagu hone ke pehle ke un 75 dinon main hamane jo kaam kiye, us gati se kisi bhi rajya main koi kaam nahin hua
 So there is no question of resignation
 haa, agar main teen yaa chaar saal se is pad par hota or tab aisa nateeja miltaa to shaayad mujhe aisa sochane kii jarurat hoti
 Constant defeat of Congress
 kareeb 50 siton par simatana, yah party ke vinaash ke lakshan hai? kya congress bataur rashtriya party apraasangik ho chuki he?jab main saansad tha to us samay sansad main bhaajapa kii sirf do siten thim
 It keeps happening, i think any result is part of a game of ups and downs
 janadesh jitna bada hota he, phisalane kii gati utani hi tej hoti he, kyonki ummiden bahut zyada hoti hai
 The public starts thinking that he has been cheated
 is chunaav main ham un muddon kaa bhi jawaab dene main vifal rahe jinka modi ke pradarshan yaa unke vaadon se koi sarokaar nahin tha
 What were those issues? Modi brought up the issue of nationalism which surprised me because there is not a single name in the BJP — neither today or in the past — that played any role in the freedom struggle
 phir bhi ve rashtrawaad kaa naaraa buland karte rahe
 They succeeded in enticing people on things that were not the issue
 suna he, congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha he ki ashok gahalot, pi
 Chidambaram and you did not do any work and kept paying more attention to your sons election campaigns
 kya aapane apana 100 fisadi diya?main ek din ke liye chhindwara main tha
 People have been voting for me for 40 years and as the longest MP in the country, i do not need to spend time there
 lihaaja, bete ko chunaav jitaane par dhyaan dene kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 i went on an election campaign every day in the state and while Rahul was here, i was still with him in all his programs
 yah bhi sunne main aayaa ki rahul gandhi maanate hai ki aap jaise netaaon ne apni jansabhaon main 'chaukeedaar chor he' naare ko sahi tareeke se nahin uthaaya or congress ke abhiyaan ko gati nahin di
 Was there any specific reason? In all our campaigns, 'chaukidar Chor Hai', the slogan was used
 lekin hakeekat yah he ki abhiyaan sirf ek naare par nirbhar nahin hota
 Modi had to hide his failure in his five-year tenure on incomplete promises or incomplete promises made to farmers
 ve rojgaar or aarthik vikaas jaise vaastavik muddon se janata kaa dhyaan hataane main kamayab rahe
 He raised some other issues that people took up
 rahul gandhi ne sanket diya he ki ve congress adhyaksh pad chhodia chaahate hai
 i think Rahul Gandhi should continue as the Congress President, because when the situation deteriorates, you should stay firmly in your place and when the situation is better, then of course you can decide to leave
 abhi hamaari sthiti najuk he, lihaaja, unhen pad chhodie kii baat nahin kerani chahie
 They say it is my responsibility; In fact it is the responsibility of every member
 chunavi maahaul un muddon par banaaya gaya tha, jinka ham muqabla nahin kar paa rahe the
 His (BJP) campaign was completely different from our issues and he got the support of the public
 agar rahul gandhi vaaki pad chhodte hai to kya unki jagah priyanka gandhi lengi yaa gandhi parivaar se baahar kaa koi netaa pad par hoga?ab tak maine rahul gandhi ke bagaiyr congress kii kalpana nahin kii he
 lets see
 maine abhi is bare main nahin sochaa he
 What should the Congress do to regain its place? The most important is that the electoral machinery of the BJP is stronger than the Congress
 unke paas aresas, bajrang dal, vishwa hindu parishad, saraswati shishu mandir or 15-20 sanghathan hai
 We do not have such organizations
 hamen apni chunavi mashinari taiyaar karne ke tareeke khojane honge
 Our ideology or policy is not wrong, but without the electoral machinery, how will you counter the propaganda against you? You have claimed that efforts are being made to destabilize your government in Madhya Pradesh
 aap sabko ekajute rakhane ke liye kya kar rahe hai? bhaajapa kii ore se khatra kitna bada he?bhaajapa apana manobal ooncha rakhane ke liye yah gaati rahati he
 But at the time of the election of the Speaker of the Assembly, we won the first examination
 phir unhone kaha ki dipti spikar kaa pad vipaksh ko jaataa he
 i said, this will not happen
 hamane paripati ke vipareet jaakar chunaav karaayaa or nattejey main dipti spikar ke pad par bhi hamaari hi jeet hui
 This shows that the bjp's plan to destabilize the government could not be completed
 iskar vibhaag ne aapke sahyogiyon ke gharon kii talaashi lee or hawala lenden ke aarope lagaae
 Two raids were conducted on the houses of some of my staff members, among others
 chaape main jis vyakti ke paas paise mili usne camere par kaha he ki vah bhaajapa kaa aadmi he
 He has told clearly
 paise or dastavej mili
 Nothing was found in the raids on the houses of people associated with me
 lekin ve (bhaajapa vaale) aisa nahin kah rahe
 They are saying that the houses of these people were raided and they were recovered
 par ve yah nahin bataa rahe ki baramadagi kahaan hui
 i don't know if there is pressure on them
 lekin lenden ke masale par main bhaajapa se poochna chahta hum ki agar unhone nai dilli main ek hajaar karod rupye kaa karyaalay banaaya he, to paisa kahaan se aayaa? unhone beshumaar paise kii badaulat loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav ladaa
 Where did the money come from — selling their wives' jewelry or their possessions? First they answer it
 vidhansabha chunaav prachaar ke dauraan aapane kaha tha ki madhya pradesh main bhrashtachar bada mudda he or aap pichhali sarkaar kii aniyamittaaon ko ujagar karenge
 What action have you taken? As i said i had only 75 days, during that time my focus was on getting the state out of the quagmire
 ab i-tendering ghotaale main exiar darj hui he
 Six people have been arrested
 saboot milane par or giraftaaryaan hongi
 i think about Rs 20,000 crore in the e-tendering scam
 khaae gaye
 According to the recent report that came to me, there were around 400 fake tenders but not seven
 shaayad congress ke paas pratidwandviyon ke galat kaaryon par waar karne main bhaajapa vaali aakraamakata nahin?main kisi ko nishaanaa nahin bana rahaa
 This is the difference between BJP politics and Congress
 uchit jaanch jaruri he jo chal rahi he
 Every department is full of corruption
 kahaan se shuru karen? bhrashtachar hi bhrashtachar bharaa he
 What are the measures you are taking to generate employment for the people of Madhya Pradesh? There are two challenges - one, to provide employment to the youth or to ensure that they do their employment; Second, farming
 pradesh main 70 fisadi log is par nirbhar hai
 The owner of the village grocery store, who may not be a farmer, but his sales depend on the purchasing power of the farmers
 bees saal pehle chunauti kam paidaavaar thi, ab adhik paidaavaar he
 The problem is of abundance
 kisaanon ko nivesh par uchit munafa kaise mili? kisaan aatmahatya ke peeche yahi vajahen hai
 New thinking is needed
 pehle hamane upaj kranti kii disha main kadam badaye the, ab aap kranti kaa samay aayaa he
 Your government focused on farm loan waiver
 lekin usase aapako ummiido ke anuroop loksabhaa siten nahin milin?usase vah hona bhi nahin tha
 Its purpose was not to take more seats in elections
 vah logon kii pareshaani dur karne kii disha main pehla kadam tha
 After all, a farmer is born in debt and dies due to debt burden
 karj maafee par pradhanmantri modi kaa kahana tha ki congress ke mukhyamantri ne vaada to kiya lekin use puraa nahin kiya
 Modi ji did nothing
 maine to kuch kiya he: kareeb bees lakh kisaanon ke karj maaf kiye gaye hai, baakiyon ke liye bhi prakriya jald shuru ho jaaegi
 If a farmer gets one lakh rupees in his account, his purchasing power also increases, which increases economic activity
 aarthik gatividhiyon kaa bada hissaa bazaar arthvyavastha ke daayre ke baahar hota he or vah jidipi ke aankadon main najar nahin aata
 Where will you get money for all this? We have asked the nationalized banks to forgive the loan taken by the industries
 udyogon ke liye ham 40 fisadi kaa khamiyaja bhugatne ke liye taiyaar ho gaye, lekin kisaanon ke liye hamane kya kiya? rajya sarkaar unka karj apane sir le sakati he or agar ham use chukaane se manaa kar dete hai to vah bainkon ke liye gaiyr-nishpadit parisampattiyon (enpie) main tabdeel ho jayega or unki banlence shit ko kharaab karegaa
 Ten per cent more of what they do for industries should be done for agriculture
 sheduld bainkon ne yah kiya
 Are you also thinking of some new schemes that can raise more resources without increasing the tax burden? There are many such schemes but the problem is to implement them
 main un yojanaon ko khatm kar duungaa jo vaanchit parinaam nahin de paa rahi hai
 The previous Chief Minister had formulated a scheme in which it was proposed to benefit people from 'being born to dying'
 kya aap uski samiksha karenge?ham usko parishkrut kar rahe hai
 We have to think how do we improve the delivery of schemes so that their benefits can reach the beneficiaries
 This will also require a change in the bureaucratic attitude
 bajet main bachi-khuchi raashi ko jaldbaaji main kharch kar dene kii avadharana ko khatm kiye jane kii jarurat he
 Talking about bureaucracy, allegations are being made that many transfers took place and a lot of money was transacted for those transfers

 Transferred and will continue

 unhen ab vaazib mauka milanaa hi chahie

 Due to your cow shed venture, it seems as if you have gone one step ahead of the BJP in the cow's agenda

 Earlier this tension was with Kapil but since marriage, it has started happening to Divyanka too

 Kapil has come with his new show from Sharma, since then he has been included in the list of top-5 shows only once or twice

 ) Activists from all over the country gathered at the Congress' public outrage rally held in Delhi on Sunday
 is kaarykram ko sambodhit karte hue congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne jahaan piem modi ko unki sarkaar kii naakaami yaad dilaai
 At the same time, he also told the story of the technical problem in his flight
 rahul ne apane is anubhav ko saajha karte hue ek nayaa card bhi khel diya
 Rahul Gandhi said, 'I was going to Karnataka two-three days ago, i was on a plane
 plane achaanak 8 hajaar feet neeche aa gaya
 i was shaken from inside and felt that the car was gone
 tabhi mujhe kailash maansarovar yaad aayaa
 Now i want to leave you for 10 to 15 days so that i can go on a trip to Kailash Mansarovar
 'rahul gandhi kaa yah bayaan chunavi drushti ke lihaaj se kaaphi ahm mana ja rahaa he
 At the same time, it is being linked to the soft Hindutva image of the Congress
 darasal, iske peeche kai vajah bhi hai
 The BJP, which came to power at the Center in 2014 with an absolute majority, has been accusing the Congress of being an anti-hindu party
 pichley kuch samay se chunaav-dar chunaav harati aa rahi he congress ne bhi virodhiyon ke is aarope ko kamjor karne or apni chhavi badalane kii bharpoor koshish kii he
 The hallmark of which was first seen in the Gujarat assembly elections
 gujarat main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan jab rahul gandhi ne mandir darshan ko pramukhataa di to har taraf congress kii soft hindutv chhavi kii charchaa hone lagi
 The Congress party and Rahul Gandhi themselves kept making claims of being staunch Hindus from the public platform
 yahaan tak ki rahul ne khud ko janeudhari tak bataaya
 After Gujarat, Rahul Gandhi and Congress leaders are also touring the monasteries in Karnataka
 rahul gandhi ne soobe main lingayat, vokkaligga or kurba samudaay se jude mathon or mandiron kaa daura kiya he
 He is often seen wearing a vaccine on the forehead, worshiping in temples, taking blessings from priests
 isi kadi main aaj rahul ne jab karnataka jate vakt apane plane main ai dikkat kaa vakya sunaaya to yahaan bhi vah bada card khel gaye
 Rahul said that when he felt that the car was gone now (probably the last time had come), he remembered Kailash Mansarovarki
 rahul ne aisa kehete hue karnataka chunaav ke baad kailash maansarovar yatra par jane kaa elaan kar diya
 On the one hand, while Rahul publicly announced himself to go to the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, on the other hand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been campaigning in Karnataka since May 1, was unable to visit Baba Kedar despite his proposed program
 ravivaar ko hi baba kedarnath ke kapaat khule hai or is maukey par piem modi ko kedarnath janaa tha, lekin unka kaarykram radd ho gaya
 So now that all the parties are engaged in the admission 2019
 aise main chunavi raajnneeti main haashiye par khadi najar aa rahi congress bhi kambek ke liye har mumican daanv chalati dikhaai de rahi he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi is also seen adopting every trick to surround the BJP in the same manner
 haalanki, is puri kavayad kaa chunavi nateezon par kya asar hota he, yah to vakt hi batayega
 Explain that the journey of Kailash Mansarovar is considered to be the most difficult journey of Hinduism
 aise main bataur congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa is yatra par janaa ek bade sandesh ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he

 is nivesh se mandir ko 69 lakh rupee kaa salanaa byaaj milegaa
 Significantly, it has been almost a month since the gold monetization scheme was launched, but the public did not show as much interest in it as the Modi government had hoped

 For 47-year-old Shah Rukh Havildar, trees and plants are everything

 By cutting the bottles of beer, they prepared such pots in which even if water is not added for a month, the plant remains green
 bekaar bottlen, tub lite, fus balb, puraane tair, juute, nariyal or andey kii khol tak main unhone paudhe ugaae
 Even in small shellfish, plants thrived
 nursery ke liye plastic kii nai theliyon kii bajaae doodh ke istemaal ho chuke paauch kaam main liye
 Shah Rukh made more creative use of waste items
 bekaar vastuon se plantesan wal banaai
 For this, parallel to some broken PVC pipes, cut them in half and filled them with soil and planted plants
 is tarah hari-bhari plantesan wal taiyaar ho gai
 Statistics from the Forestry-related government department show that while the survival rate of their planted plants varies from 30 to 40 percent, Shahrukh's hundred percent plants grow
 rudhipoon ko taak par rakh unhone aise paudhe bhi lagaae hai jinhen vaastu ke mutabik acha nahin mana jaataa
 He has not only showered Besharam but has also prepared his Bonsai
 unke sangrah main pipal, neem, gulmohar, gooler sahit do sau se zyada bonsai ped hai
 But lakhs of rupees
 kii keemat vaale ye ped bikri ke liye katai nahin hai
 For Shahrukh, they are like his children
 bakaul shahrukh, ‘‘kuch saal pehle mumbai ke ek architect ne kai saare bonsai kharidne ke liye 10 lakh ru
 Was offered meraa jawaab tha, main aapako 15 lakh ru
 Will you be able to give me your son if i give it? He understood that these trees are like family members for me
 ’’ 24-25 saal puraane bonsai pedo ke liye unhen lagbhag nabbe hajaar ru
 a proposal per plant was also received but Shah Rukh did not let his family disintegrate
 shahrukh ke is anuthe sansar main sirf ped-paudhe hi nahin, dheron jaanavar bhi hai
 His beloved parrot, dogs, his donkey Simran, ducks, white rats, rabbits, chickens, fish and crab are part of his family
 teen sau se zyada kabutaron ke liye unhen har maheene do quintal se zyada jowar kaa intjaam karnaa padataa he
 All five of his dogs are stationed at all times in the protection of plants and other animals
 kisi kii majaal he ki unki anumati ke bina is anuthi duniya main koi pravesh kar jaae
 Shahrukh did not even marry for the sake of his world
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘dar tha ki koi ladki meri is duniya main rach-bas paaegi bhi yaa nahin
 Zarine, the elder sister of Shah Rukh and a homeopath by profession, is also busy taking care of these plants and animals along with her eight colleagues
 insaan or prakruti se prem unke khun main he
 Shahrukh's father and President awarded Medal
 meharbanji rustamaji hawaldaar ne bhi taumr garibon kii seva kii he
 By the way, doctors are also Shahrukh, but not of humans, but of trees and plants
 log apane biimaar or murajhaae hue paudhe unke paas chhod jate he or ve unhen kuch hi dinon main unhen changa kar lautaa dete he
 This talent of Shahrukh has established him as an expert
 ab log garden kii planning, land-scaping ke liye bataur salaahkaar unki sevaayen lene lage hai
 "he has a lot of imagination," says Thakur Virendra Singh, a businessman who enjoys Shah Rukh's advisory services
 ve banjar jameen ko bhi haraa-bharaa bana sakate hai

 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ko likhe patr main unhone kaha he ki jaise hi kendra sarkaar naye rajyon (bundelkhand evam pashchimi uttar pradesh) ke gathan kii sahmati de detii he, unki sarkaar vidhansabha se is aashay kaa prastaav paarit karvaa kar kendra sarkaar ko bhej degi

 It is being told that this 2005 batch IAS officer has decided to quit the job and join BJP
 yadi sab kuch thik rahaa to opi choudhary raigarh jile kii kharsia seat se bijepi ke ummidavaar ho sakate hai
 It is being said that he has met party president Amit Shah twice to enter BJP
 gauratlab he ki mukhyamantriraman singhki good book main bataur iees adhikari opi choudhary kaa naam awwal rahaa he
 Two reasons are given for this, firstly, he is a resident of Byang village in Raigarh district of Chhattisgarh and he chose his native cadre in this state after expressing his desire to work in Chhattisgarh itself

 When asked about this, he avoided the question of resigning from the job and joining the political party
 unki baton se saaf jhalak rahaa tha ki jab tak bijepi haikaman se unhen tikat kaa vaada nahin mil jaataa, tab tak wo apni raajnneetik ichha shakti saarvajanik nahin karenge

 Ashutosh Gowariker's film Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Se on the Chittagong Uprising, released on December 3, is the story of the Bengali revolutionary Suryasena and the valor of two girls
 goarikar ne film ‘khelen ham ji jaan se’ main jis ghatana ko apana vishay banaaya he
 Actually it has been a neglected event in history
 film samikshakon or itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki goarikar kaa prayaas saraahneey he, jisase desh ke logon ko ek shaurypurna ghatana ke bare main pataa chalegaa
 Film critic k h Singh says that the impact of Gowarikar's film at the box office will be known only after its release, but the theme chosen in it is amazing in itself
 unhone kaha ki goarikar har baar kuch na kuch vishesh karte hai or yah film bhi unke isi prayaas kaa hissaa he
 Gowariker has to say about his own film, Singh says that this film will be special not only for the Indian audience but also for the viewers of Pakistan and Bangladesh, because Chittagong is currently in Bangladesh
 maharishi dayanand vishvavidhyalay se sambhddha itihaasavetta em malik ke anusaar ghatana 18 april 1930 se shuru hoti he, jab bengal ke chatgaanv main aazaadee ke diwaanon ne angrejon ko ukhaad phenkane ke liye indian republican army (iaare) kaa gathan kar liya
 The formation of the IRA sparked a revolution in Bengal and on 18 April 1930, dozens of revolutionaries, led by Suryasena, plundered the armory of Chittagong and declared the end of British rule
 kranti kii jwaala ke chalate hukumat ke numaayinde dum dabaakar bhaag gaye or chatgaanv main kuch din ke liye britania shashan kaa ant ho gaya
 This incident added fuel to the fire and the freedom struggle also raged in other parts of the country outside Bengal

 You have also seen the condition of Sampurnanand Sanskrit College, Banaras, the building is magnificent, the history is magnificent but the current shame
 samasya yah he ki jinka sanskrit se koi lenaa-dena nahin he, wo sanskrit ke naare laga rahe hai
 There is no one to listen to the slogans of those who are related to Sanskrit
 sampoornanand sanskrit vishvavidhyalay ke chaatro ko ummid thi ki prime time main mudda uthne ke baad kuch asar hoga
 The administration felt that we had forgotten the story but when Ajay Singh went again, then the leader of the employees union has told the Vice Chancellor that the fund has been arranged, the salary will be paid
 magar samasya sirf vetan nahin he
 This is the only movement in the whole of India at the moment to address the shortage of teachers and demand for education
 10 din baad in chaatro ne apana mundan kara liya
 Shraddha of the system was done
 vyavasthaaen aise shraadh karm se nahin ghabraati hai
 They know that for many decades they have shaved millions of students, nothing will happen if the students are shaved
 pradhanmantri kaa kshetra hone ke baad bhi itani jaldi shikshak behaal hone se rahe
 Nowadays everyone has the same readymade formula, get the teacher on contract, get half the salary done
 chaatro ne visi kaa pindadaan karte samay mantron ke uccharan kii pavitrataa kaa khaas dhyaan rakhaa gaya
 The employees union also kept changing its movement in Leela
 kabhi boot paalish karte rahe to kabhi chaay bechate rahe
 Selling tea has now become a symbol of resistance as it relates to the Prime Minister's past
 karmchaariyon ko vetan milane kii khabar baad main ai he, usase pehle jab ajay singh sampoornanand sanskrit uniwarsity ke vaais chancelar se baat karne gaye to ve is aatmavishvaas se bhare dikhe
 The VC of Sampurnanand Sanskrit University also feels that the sit-ins are outsiders
 aajkal bharat kaa loktantr lagata he bahari chalaa rahe hai
 Every Indian questioning those sitting within the system has an outsider look
 ajay singh ke alaava karunaa sindhu pahunche baliya ke devi prasad sanskrit mahavidhyalay
 This college is associated with Sampurnanand Sanskrit University
 zamin par kuch bhi nahin he, college pratham tal par hi chalata he
 There is only one room office on the first floor
 dwitiya tal par tin shed main kakshaen chal rahi hai
 The record that 150 students of Sanskrit read Sanskrit to live in odd conditions in the midst of the blazing fire under the tin shed in summer is unimaginable
 yahaan kii tuuti hui kursiyaan bataa rahi hai ki kabhi na kabhi koi avatar purush aayega jo vot maangane se thak jane par inkaa kalyaan karegaa
 If no one does, then these chairs know that like Sanskrit, they too can remain broken for many centuries
 jin 150 chaatro ko is agni kunda main padhane kaa saubhaahgya praapt hua he, ve na hote to aaj sanskrit shiksha kaa koi naam leva na hota
 Their poverty has brought this subject
 yahaan ek hi adhyaaapak hai jo kaaryvahak principal bhi hai
 Off records show that the college has an old building, but a private school runs there
 jo adhyaaapak hai unhen sahi samay par vetan nahin miltaa he
 The city of Ballia has the distinction of receiving another Sanskrit college
 iskaa naam jubilee sanskrit college he
 Two students are studying here
 is college kii chat bagair kisi purv soochna ke kabhi bhi gir sakati he
 So much so that you can see cracks before falling
 samajashaastra ke ek kamare kaa puraa plaster gir chukaa he
 There are two teachers for teaching 150 students, who are not able to give up the dignity of being teachers even if they do not get salary for 7-8 months
 aap sochate honge ki ek ke baad ek collejon kii haalat dekhakar kya laabh hoga
 It is important to watch them so that your confusion is broken
 aap lakh shahar badal den, college badal len, padhai kaa karcha badha den, har jagah isi sankat se aapkaa saamana hoga
 Every other man city in India is changing due to poor colleges
 baliya vaala banaras aa rahaa he, banaras vaala lakhanu ja rahaa he, lakhanu vaala dilli ja rahaa he
 Ballia is coming around again
 mirzapur se inderesh pandey ne yah report bheji he
 The Joint Sanskrit College has only one teacher for studying from VIII to MA
 203 chaatro ko barbaad karne ke liye yah kalege khulaa hua he
 Indresh found no BA and MA students in the college
 wo aae bhi kyon, jab pataa he ki bharat main bullate train aa jaaegi magar unke college main teacher nahin aayega, to jane se kya laabh
 Class 10 children are practicing to connect with Smart India, Digital India through mobile phones
 camere ko dekhte hi laga ki jaise guruji ko dekh liya, lihaaza mobile jeb main rakh shloke ratane lage
 The college principal's room is telling that its future cannot be glorious
 kai jagahon par ek baat sunai di
 Most of the students studying Sanskrit are poor
 aarthik kamazori ke kaaran kuch or nahin pard sakate to sanskrit padhane aa jate hai, jahaan sanskrit kaa college unhen aaajeevan garib bane rahane kii shiksha detaa he
 This is why the creation of knowledge in Sanskrit is decreasing
 karmkand kii zaruuraton ke liye isaki vyaavhaarikta rah gai he
 If there was no poverty, there would be no student studying Sanskrit
 mujhe nahin pataa tha ki bharat kii garibi sanskrit kaa itnaa khyaal rakhti he
 By the way, the Government of India has created the National Institute of Sanskrit since 1970 to take care of Sanskrit
 jiskaa mukhyalay dilli ke janakapuri main chal rahaa he
 If you look at the pictures of this institution, we tell its history and present on this excuse
 rashtriya sanskrit santhaan bharat main sanskrit shiksha kaa ucch kend he
 In 1956-57, the first Sanskrit Commission was formed on the suggestion of which the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan was established
 bharat yaa bharat ke baahar rashtriya sanskrit santhaan sheersh nodel agency he
 In May 2002, the Vajpayee government gave it the status of deemed university
 murali manohan joshi tab maanav sansaadhan mantri hua karte the
 Earlier, the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan had campuses in Jaipur, Puri and Singeri
 singery campus kaa udghaatan rajeev gandhi ne kiya tha
 Most of its campuses date back to 1997
 tasveeron main sabhi campus kii haalat acchhee dikhti he
 In 2012, the World Sanskrit Conference was held in Delhi
 isamen tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne rashtriya sanskrit santhaan ko antarrashtriya vishvavidhyalay ke str kaa banane kii baat kahi thi
 No one knows what happened to that goal
 usee samay sanskrit kii samasyaon or sambhaavnaaon par vichaar karne ke liye sanskrit ayog ke gathan kii baat hui thi jise do saal baad 10 janvari, 2014 ko puraa kar diya gaya
 On 9 January 2015, the term of the Second Sanskrit Commission came to an end
 iske chairman sanskrit bhashaa main gyanpith puraskaar praapt professor satyavrath shastri banaae gaye the
 On December 17, 2015, Ann
 gopal swami ke netritv main ek panel bana, jisane 32 pej kii report teen maheene main saunp di gai
 The Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan operates directly from the Ministry of Human Resources
 iske tamaam campus main
 40 to 50 percent are not teachers
 inaki jagah kareeb 200 shikshak theke par padhaa rahe hai
 Many of whom have been teaching on contract for 15-15 years
 ve theke par padhaane ke liye to yogya maane jate hai magar permanent karne ke liye nahin
 When the teacher is insecure about his future, how will he overcome the insecurity of Sanskrit
 rashtriya sanskrit santhaan ke kulapati se susheel mahapatra ne baat kii
 This problem is normal for them and only God can fix it
 rashtriya sanskrit santhaan ke campus jammu, elahabaad, dilli, mumbai, bhopal, himachal pradesh, shringery, jaipur, lakhanu, guruvayur, puri or agartalla main main hai
 This is the new Idara of Sanskrit but it also could not take Sanskrit further
 jaipur campus 1983 se hi kaayam he
 There are 900 students in total and around a hundred students are doing phd
 yahaan par yoga or ayurveda ko milakar ek nayaa diploma course bhi laanch kiya gaya he
 The principal here says that there is a shortage of teachers in this institute but not of dedication
 unhone bataaya ki unke campus se rajasthan public sarvice kamishan kii pariksha main is saal bees chaatro ne paas kiya he
 From Sanskrit
 magar sabane kantrect par yani aadhi tankhwaah par padhaane se samjhauta kar liya he
 If the students of these contractual teachers are doing so well, then they must be managed
 yahaan 34 permanent shikshak hai or 37 kantrect par
 Trouble arises where a sense of asymmetry arises, the partner of the same is earning a decent salary on a pay scale having equal merit
 vetan aayogon kaa laabh paa rahaa he die kaa laabh paa rahaa he, duusari taraf utani hi yogyata vaala vyakti utana hi shram vaala vyakti ek nishchit raashi par kaam kar rahaa he, to aap sochie ki manushya ke man kii banaavat
 Will there be any kind of good feeling in his mind towards his own partner, who is going to do the same thing? Will a good attitude prevail over the administration? He would like to become permanent
 court isamen sahaayak ho rahe hai jaisaa himachal main hua
 The National Institute of Sanskrit Education has a full charter for the development of Sanskrit
 iske baad bhi sanskrit ke vikaas ke liye doosraa sanskrit ayog bana, jisaki report endie ke samay jamaa hui he
 The report of the new chairman says that outright grants should be given for new Sanskrit universities in different states
 sabhi sanskrit uniwarsity main skill deveopment ke course ke liye grant diya jaae
 Special grants should be given to start modern subjects
 campus main sanskrit kaa vaataavaran banaaya jaae
 The scriptures should be studied in ordinary Sanskrit
 tamil, hindi, urdu uniwarsity kii tarah itihaas, samaaj vigyaan, vigyaan or vaanijya jaise vishay padhaaye jaaen
 Courses like b
sc, m
sc were also made in Sanskrit
 yahi saare sudhav bhartiya bhashaaon ke bare main die jate hai ki unamem rojgaar kii sambhaavna paidaa karo
 In this budget, a proposal to give 46 crores for the Hindi Directorate has been shown, but the announcement of a separate grant for Sanskrit was not visible
 lagata he ki duusare sanskrit ayog kii report ko gambhirtha se liya hi nahin gaya he
 If you know what will happen to this Sanskrit college in Sirsaganj town of Firozabad, UP, there is nothing in the Sanskrit Commission
 jo college band ho chuke hai yaa band hone ke kagaar par hai, unki zameenon yaa sansadhano kaa kya hoga, is par bhi kuch nahin he
 Arya Gurukul Sanskrit College has turned into ruins
 is imaarat kaa koun sa konaa dekhakar aap hai-hai karnaa chahenge, rasoi ghar yaa guestaouse yaa shauchalay
 Leave it
 bharat ko vishwa guru bananaa he, ye naaraa japate rahiye, usee se sab thik ho jayega
 There used to be around 300 students till the 80s, at present there are only 7 students
 inke liye ek shikshak hai jinka vetan sarkaar bhejti he or teen karmchaaree bhi hai
 One teacher for seven students
 lagata he ki koi dekhne vaala nahin ki sarkaar ke sansadhano kaa kaise behatar istemaal kiya jaae
 In 1978, the founder of the institute was killed in a land dispute
 tippaniyan These useless resources could also be used in the development of Sanskrit, but it is necessary for it to work
 puri loksabhaa se bijedy saansad pinaki mishra ne poocha tha ki naukari ke avasaron kii kami ke kaaran pichley das varshon main sanskrit padhaane vaale adhyapakon kii sankhya main bahut kami ai he, kya yah sahi he
 Has the number of Sanskrit students decreased
 17 july, 2017 ko jawaab dete hue maanav sansaadhan rajya mantri doctor mahend nath pandeya ne kaha ki mantralay skulon or collejon main sanskrit padhaane vaale shikshakon kii sankhya kaa record nahin rakhata he
 According to available information, there has been no decrease in the posts of Sanskrit teachers
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay ke paas jab shikshakon kii sankhya kaa record nahin he to phir kya he
 Nevertheless, the Minister is saying that there has been no reduction in the posts of Sanskrit teachers
 hamane kai jagah dekha ki sanskrit ke shikshak kam hai
 There has also been a decrease in students
 banaras ke sampoornanand sanskrit universti main bhi sanskrit ke shikshak kam hai
 The Chancellor of the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan also believes that the teachers are few
 adhyaaapak kii kami or padhai kii maang ko is vakt puure bharat kaa yah akelaa andolan he
 After 10 days, these students got their shaving done
 vyavastha kaa shraadh karm kar daalaa
 The systems do not panic with such Shraddha Karma
 unhen pataa he ki kai dashakon se ve lakhon chaatro kaa mundan kar chuki hai, chaatro ke mundan karne se kuch nahin hoga
 Even after being the prime minister's field, the teacher kept getting reinstated so soon
 aajkal sabake paas ek hi redimaid formula he, theke par teacher le aaen, aadhi selary main kaam karaao
 The sanctity of the chanting of mantras was taken care of by the students while pitting the VC
 karmchaaree union ne bhi apane andolan ko lila main badalte rahe
 Sometimes polished the boot and sometimes sold tea
 chaay bechnaa ab pratirodh kaa pratik ban chukaa he kyonki iskaa sambandh pradhanmantri ke ateet se he
 The news of employees getting salary came later, when Ajay Singh went to talk to the Vice Chancellor of Sampurnanand Sanskrit University, he was full of this confidence
 sampoornanand sanskrit uniwarsity ke visi ko bhi lagata he ki dharna dene vaale bahari hai
 Nowadays democracy of India seems to be running external
 system ke bheetar baithe logon ko sawaal karne vaale har bhartiya main ek bahari dikh rahaa he
 Apart from Ajay Singh, Karuna reached Indus Devi Prasad Sanskrit College, Ballia
 yah kalege sampoornanand sanskrit uniwarsity se hi judaa hua he
 There is nothing on the ground, the college runs on the first floor
 pratham tal par ek hi kamare kaa aphis he
 Classes are going on in the Teen Shed on the second floor
 garmi main tin shed ke neeche dadhakati agni jwaala ke bich yahaan ke 150 chaatr sanskrit padhakar visham paristhitiyon main jeene kaa jo kirtiman banaate hai wo acolpaneey he
 The broken chairs here are telling that at some time some avatar man will come, who will get welfare of them if they get tired of asking for votes
 koi na bhi kare to in kursiyon ko pataa he ki sanskrit kii tarah ve bhi kai sadiyon tak tuuti hui padi rah sakati hai
 If 150 students who have had the privilege of studying in this Agni Kund, would not have had any name for Sanskrit education today
 unki garibi is vishay tak le ai he
 There is only one teacher who is also the acting principal
 of record pataa chalaa ki kalege kii puraani building hai, magar vahaan privet skool chalata he
 Those who are teachers do not get salary at the right time
 baliya shahar ko ek or sanskrit kalege praapt hone kaa gaurav hasil he
 Its name is Jubilee Sanskrit College
 yahaan do chaatr padhai kar rahe hai
 The roof of this college can fall anytime without any prior notice
 itnaa kaaphi he ki girane se pehle aap daraaren dekh sakate hai
 The entire plaster of a room in sociology has fallen
 padhaane ke liye 150 chaatro par do adhyaaapak hai jo bina 7-8 maheene se vetan na milane par bhi adhyaaapak hone kii garima chhod nahin paa rahe hai
 You must be wondering what would be the benefit of seeing the condition of colleges one after the other
 inhen dekhnaa isliye zaruri he ki taaki aapkaa bhram toote
 You change lakhs of cities, change colleges, increase the cost of education, you will face this crisis everywhere
 kharaab collejon ke kaaran bharat main har doosraa aadmi shahar badal rahaa he
 Ballia is going to Benaras, Benaras is going to Lucknow, Lucknow is going to Delhi
 gum phir kar baliya aa ja rahaa he
 Indresh Pandey from Mirzapur has sent this report
 sanyukt sanskrit mahavidhyalay, yahaan par aathvin se lekar eme tak kii padhai ke liye sirf ek adhyaaapak he
 The college is open to waste 203 students
 inderesh ko kalege main bie or eme ke ek bhi chaatr nahin mili
 Why did he come, when he knows that a bullet train will arrive in India, but if there is no teacher in his college, then what is the benefit of going? 10veen class ke bachche mobile phone ke zarie smart india, digital india se conect hone kaa abhyaas kar rahe hai
 As soon as he saw the camera, it was as if he had seen Guruji, so in the mobile pocket, shlokas started to be chanted
 college ke principal kaa cameraa bataa rahaa he ki iskaa bhavishya gauravshaalee ho hi nahin saktaa
 One thing was heard in many places
 sanskrit padhane vaale zyaadaatar chaatr garib hai
 If you cannot study anything else due to economic weakness, then you come to study Sanskrit, where the college of Sanskrit teaches them to remain poor for life
 yahi kaaran he ki sanskrit main gyaan kaa nirmaan kam ho rahaa he
 Its practicality for ritual needs has ceased
 garibi na hoti to sanskrit padhane vaala koi chaatr nahin hota
 i did not know that India's poverty takes care of Sanskrit so much
 vaise bharat sarkaar ne sanskrit kaa khyaal rakhane ke liye 1970 se rashtriya sanskrit santhaan banaaya he
 Its headquarter is running in Delhi's Janakpuri
 aap is santhaan kii tasveeron ko dekhte chaliye, ham isi bahaane iskaa itihaas or vartmaan bataate hai
 The Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan is the high center of Sanskrit education in India
 1956-57 main pratham sanskrit ayog bana tha jiske suzav par rashtriya sanskrit santhaan kii sthapana hui thi
 National Sanskrit Sansthan is the top nodal agency in India or outside India
 may, 2002 main vaajapeyi sarkaar ne ise dimd uniwarsity kaa darja de diya
 Murali Manohan Joshi was then the Minister of Human Resources
 iske pehle tak rashtriya sanskrit santhaan ke jaipur, puri or singery main campus hua karata tha
 The Singeri campus was inaugurated by Rajiv Gandhi
 iske zyaadaatar campus 1997 ke pehle ke bane hue hai
 The condition of all the campus looks good in the pictures
 2012 main dilli main vishwa sanskrit sammelan hua tha
 In this, the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh talked about making the National Sanskrit Sansthan an international university
 us lakshya kaa kya hua, koi nahin jaanata
 At the same time there was talk of the formation of the Sanskrit Commission to consider the problems and possibilities of Sanskrit which was completed after two years on January 10, 2014
 9 janvari, 2015 ko duusare sanskrit ayog kaa kaarykaal khatm ho gaya
 Its chairman was made Professor Satyavrat Shastri, who received the Jnanpith Award in Sanskrit
 17 disambar, 2015 ko en
 a panel led by Gopal Swamy was formed, which submitted the 32-page report in three months
 rashtriya sanskrit santhaan sidhaa maanav sansaadhan mantralay se sanchalit hota he
 In all its campuses
 40 se 50 fisadi shikshak nahin he
 In their place, about 200 teachers are teaching on contract
 jinamein se kai 15-15 saal se theke par padhaa rahe hai
 They are considered qualified to teach on contract but not for permanent work
 jab shikshak hi apane bhavishya ko lekar asurakshit hai to vah sanskrit kii asuraksha kaise dur karegaa
 Sushil Mahapatra spoke to the Vice Chancellor of the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan

 Even after this, a second Sanskrit Commission was formed for the development of Sanskrit, whose report has been submitted at the time of NDA
 nae chairman kii report main kaha gaya he ki alag-alag rajyon main nai sanskrit uniwarsity ke liye ekamusth grant diya jaae
 Grant should be given for the skill development course in all Sanskrit universities

 It seems that the report of the Second Sanskrit Commission has not been taken seriously
 agar aapako pataa ho ki upi ke phirozabad ke sirsaganj kasbe ke is sanskrit college kaa kya hoga, iske bare main sanskrit ayog main kuch nahin he
 There is nothing on what will happen to the lands or resources of the colleges which have been closed or are on the verge of closure

 Make India a world guru, keep chanting this slogan, everything will be alright with that
 80 ke dashak tak yahaan 300 ke kareeb chaatr hua karte the, is samay sirf 7 chaatr hai
 For this, there is a teacher whose salary is sent by the government and there are three employees
 saat chaatro ke liye ek shikshak
 It seems that no one is going to see how to use the government's resources better
 1978 main is santhaan ke sansthaapak kii zamin vivaad main hatya ho gai thi
 The comments in bekaar pade sansadhano kaa istemaal bhi sanskrit ke vikaas main ho saktaa tha, magar uske liye zaruri he ki kaam ho
 BJD MP from Puri Lok Sabha Pinaki Mishra had asked that in the last ten years the number of teachers teaching Sanskrit has come down drastically due to lack of job opportunities, is this correct? kya sanskrit chaatro kii sankhya main kami ai he
 Replying on 17 July 2017, Minister of State for Human Resources, Dr
 Mahendra Nath Pandey said that the Ministry does not keep a record of the number of teachers teaching Sanskrit in schools and colleges
 uplabdh soochna ke anusaar sanskrit shikshakon ke padon main koi kami nahin ai he
 What is there when the Ministry of Human Resources does not have a record of the number of teachers
 phir bhi mantri ji kah rahe hai ki sanskrit shikshakon ke padon main koi kami nahin ai he
 We have seen many places that Sanskrit teachers are few
 chaatro main bhi kami ai he
 Sampurnanand Sanskrit University of Banaras also has less Sanskrit teachers
 rashtriya sanskrit santhaan ke kulapati bhi maanate hai ki shikshak kam hai
 The news of employees getting salary came later, when Ajay Singh went to talk to the Vice Chancellor of Sampurnanand Sanskrit University, he was full of this confidence
 sampoornanand sanskrit uniwarsity ke visi ko bhi lagata he ki dharna dene vaale bahari hai
 Nowadays democracy of India seems to be running external
 system ke bheetar baithe logon ko sawaal karne vaale har bhartiya main ek bahari dikh rahaa he
 Apart from Ajay Singh, Karuna reached Indus Devi Prasad Sanskrit College, Ballia
 yah kalege sampoornanand sanskrit uniwarsity se hi judaa hua he
 There is nothing on the ground, the college runs on the first floor
 pratham tal par ek hi kamare kaa aphis he
 Classes are going on in the Teen Shed on the second floor
 garmi main tin shed ke neeche dadhakati agni jwaala ke bich yahaan ke 150 chaatr sanskrit padhakar visham paristhitiyon main jeene kaa jo kirtiman banaate hai wo acolpaneey he
 The broken chairs here are telling that at some time some avatar man will come, who will get welfare of them if they get tired of asking for votes
 koi na bhi kare to in kursiyon ko pataa he ki sanskrit kii tarah ve bhi kai sadiyon tak tuuti hui padi rah sakati hai
 If 150 students who have had the privilege of studying in this Agni Kund, would not have had any name for Sanskrit education today
 unki garibi is vishay tak le ai he
 There is only one teacher who is also the acting principal
 of record pataa chalaa ki kalege kii puraani building hai, magar vahaan privet skool chalata he
 Those who are teachers do not get salary at the right time
 baliya shahar ko ek or sanskrit kalege praapt hone kaa gaurav hasil he
 Its name is Jubilee Sanskrit College
 yahaan do chaatr padhai kar rahe hai
 The roof of this college can fall anytime without any prior notice
 itnaa kaaphi he ki girane se pehle aap daraaren dekh sakate hai
 The entire plaster of a room in sociology has fallen
 padhaane ke liye 150 chaatro par do adhyaaapak hai jo bina 7-8 maheene se vetan na milane par bhi adhyaaapak hone kii garima chhod nahin paa rahe hai
 You must be wondering what would be the benefit of seeing the condition of colleges one after the other
 inhen dekhnaa isliye zaruri he ki taaki aapkaa bhram toote
 You change lakhs of cities, change colleges, increase the cost of education, you will face this crisis everywhere
 kharaab collejon ke kaaran bharat main har doosraa aadmi shahar badal rahaa he
 Ballia is going to Benaras, Benaras is going to Lucknow, Lucknow is going to Delhi
 gum phir kar baliya aa ja rahaa he
 Indresh Pandey from Mirzapur has sent this report
 sanyukt sanskrit mahavidhyalay, yahaan par aathvin se lekar eme tak kii padhai ke liye sirf ek adhyaaapak he
 The college is open to waste 203 students
 inderesh ko kalege main bie or eme ke ek bhi chaatr nahin mili
 Why did he come, when he knows that a bullet train will arrive in India, but if there is no teacher in his college, then what is the benefit of going? 10veen class ke bachche mobile phone ke zarie smart india, digital india se conect hone kaa abhyaas kar rahe hai
 As soon as he saw the camera, it was as if he had seen Guruji, so in the mobile pocket, shlokas started to be chanted
 college ke principal kaa cameraa bataa rahaa he ki iskaa bhavishya gauravshaalee ho hi nahin saktaa
 One thing was heard in many places
 sanskrit padhane vaale zyaadaatar chaatr garib hai
 If you cannot study anything else due to economic weakness, then you come to study Sanskrit, where the college of Sanskrit teaches them to remain poor for life
 yahi kaaran he ki sanskrit main gyaan kaa nirmaan kam ho rahaa he
 Its practicality for ritual needs has ceased
 garibi na hoti to sanskrit padhane vaala koi chaatr nahin hota
 i did not know that India's poverty takes care of Sanskrit so much
 vaise bharat sarkaar ne sanskrit kaa khyaal rakhane ke liye 1970 se rashtriya sanskrit santhaan banaaya he
 Its headquarter is running in Delhi's Janakpuri
 aap is santhaan kii tasveeron ko dekhte chaliye, ham isi bahaane iskaa itihaas or vartmaan bataate hai
 The Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan is the high center of Sanskrit education in India
 1956-57 main pratham sanskrit ayog bana tha jiske suzav par rashtriya sanskrit santhaan kii sthapana hui thi

 2012 main dilli main vishwa sanskrit sammelan hua tha
 In this, the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh talked about making the National Sanskrit Sansthan an international university
 us lakshya kaa kya hua, koi nahin jaanata
 At the same time there was talk of the formation of the Sanskrit Commission to consider the problems and possibilities of Sanskrit which was completed after two years on January 10, 2014
 9 janvari, 2015 ko duusare sanskrit ayog kaa kaarykaal khatm ho gaya
 Its chairman was made Professor Satyavrat Shastri, who received the Jnanpith Award in Sanskrit
 17 disambar, 2015 ko en
 a panel led by Gopal Swamy was formed, which submitted the 32-page report in three months
 rashtriya sanskrit santhaan sidhaa maanav sansaadhan mantralay se sanchalit hota he
 In all its campuses

 In their place, about 200 teachers are teaching on contract

 They are considered qualified to teach on contract but not for permanent work

 Sampurnanand Sanskrit University of Banaras also has less Sanskrit teachers
 rashtriya sanskrit santhaan ke kulapati bhi maanate hai ki shikshak kam hai
 The city of Ballia has the distinction of receiving another Sanskrit college
 iskaa naam jubilee sanskrit college he
 Two students are studying here
 is college kii chat bagair kisi purv soochna ke kabhi bhi gir sakati he
 So much so that you can see cracks before falling
 samajashaastra ke ek kamare kaa puraa plaster gir chukaa he
 There are two teachers for teaching 150 students, who are not able to give up the dignity of being teachers even if they do not get salary for 7-8 months
 aap sochate honge ki ek ke baad ek collejon kii haalat dekhakar kya laabh hoga
 It is important to watch them so that your confusion is broken
 aap lakh shahar badal den, college badal len, padhai kaa karcha badha den, har jagah isi sankat se aapkaa saamana hoga
 Every other man city in India is changing due to poor colleges
 baliya vaala banaras aa rahaa he, banaras vaala lakhanu ja rahaa he, lakhanu vaala dilli ja rahaa he
 Ballia is coming around again
 mirzapur se inderesh pandey ne yah report bheji he
 The Joint Sanskrit College has only one teacher for studying from VIII to MA
 203 chaatro ko barbaad karne ke liye yah kalege khulaa hua he
 Indresh found no BA and MA students in the college
 wo aae bhi kyon, jab pataa he ki bharat main bullate train aa jaaegi magar unke college main teacher nahin aayega, to jane se kya laabh
 Class 10 children are practicing to connect with Smart India, Digital India through mobile phones
 camere ko dekhte hi laga ki jaise guruji ko dekh liya, lihaaza mobile jeb main rakh shloke ratane lage
 The college principal's room is telling that its future cannot be glorious
 kai jagahon par ek baat sunai di
 Most of the students studying Sanskrit are poor
 aarthik kamazori ke kaaran kuch or nahin pard sakate to sanskrit padhane aa jate hai, jahaan sanskrit kaa college unhen aaajeevan garib bane rahane kii shiksha detaa he
 This is why the creation of knowledge in Sanskrit is decreasing
 karmkand kii zaruuraton ke liye isaki vyaavhaarikta rah gai he
 If there was no poverty, there would be no student studying Sanskrit
 mujhe nahin pataa tha ki bharat kii garibi sanskrit kaa itnaa khyaal rakhti he
 By the way, the Government of India has created the National Institute of Sanskrit since 1970 to take care of Sanskrit
 jiskaa mukhyalay dilli ke janakapuri main chal rahaa he
 If you look at the pictures of this institution, we tell its history and present on this excuse
 rashtriya sanskrit santhaan bharat main sanskrit shiksha kaa ucch kend he
 In 1956-57, the first Sanskrit Commission was formed on the suggestion of which the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan was established
 bharat yaa bharat ke baahar rashtriya sanskrit santhaan sheersh nodel agency he
 In May 2002, the Vajpayee government gave it the status of deemed university
 murali manohan joshi tab maanav sansaadhan mantri hua karte the
 Earlier, the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan had campuses in Jaipur, Puri and Singeri
 singery campus kaa udghaatan rajeev gandhi ne kiya tha
 Most of its campuses date back to 1997
 tasveeron main sabhi campus kii haalat acchhee dikhti he
 In 2012, the World Sanskrit Conference was held in Delhi
 isamen tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne rashtriya sanskrit santhaan ko antarrashtriya vishvavidhyalay ke str kaa banane kii baat kahi thi

 There used to be around 300 students till the 80s, at present there are only 7 students
 inke liye ek shikshak hai jinka vetan sarkaar bhejti he or teen karmchaaree bhi hai

 puri loksabhaa se bijedy saansad pinaki mishra ne poocha tha ki naukari ke avasaron kii kami ke kaaran pichley das varshon main sanskrit padhaane vaale adhyapakon kii sankhya main bahut kami ai he, kya yah sahi he
 Has the number of Sanskrit students decreased
 17 july, 2017 ko jawaab dete hue maanav sansaadhan rajya mantri doctor mahend nath pandeya ne kaha ki mantralay skulon or collejon main sanskrit padhaane vaale shikshakon kii sankhya kaa record nahin rakhata he
 According to available information, there has been no decrease in the posts of Sanskrit teachers
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay ke paas jab shikshakon kii sankhya kaa record nahin he to phir kya he
 Nevertheless, the Minister is saying that there has been no reduction in the posts of Sanskrit teachers
 hamane kai jagah dekha ki sanskrit ke shikshak kam hai
 There has also been a decrease in students
 banaras ke sampoornanand sanskrit universti main bhi sanskrit ke shikshak kam hai
 The Chancellor of the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan also believes that the teachers are few
 vaise bharat sarkaar ne sanskrit kaa khyaal rakhane ke liye 1970 se rashtriya sanskrit santhaan banaaya he
 Its headquarter is running in Delhi's Janakpuri
 aap is santhaan kii tasveeron ko dekhte chaliye, ham isi bahaane iskaa itihaas or vartmaan bataate hai
 The Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan is the high center of Sanskrit education in India
 1956-57 main pratham sanskrit ayog bana tha jiske suzav par rashtriya sanskrit santhaan kii sthapana hui thi
 National Sanskrit Sansthan is the top nodal agency in India or outside India
 may, 2002 main vaajapeyi sarkaar ne ise dimd uniwarsity kaa darja de diya
 Murali Manohan Joshi was then the Minister of Human Resources
 iske pehle tak rashtriya sanskrit santhaan ke jaipur, puri or singery main campus hua karata tha
 The Singeri campus was inaugurated by Rajiv Gandhi
 iske zyaadaatar campus 1997 ke pehle ke bane hue hai
 The condition of all the campus looks good in the pictures
 2012 main dilli main vishwa sanskrit sammelan hua tha
 In this, the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh talked about making the National Sanskrit Sansthan an international university
 us lakshya kaa kya hua, koi nahin jaanata
 At the same time there was talk of the formation of the Sanskrit Commission to consider the problems and possibilities of Sanskrit which was completed after two years on January 10, 2014
 9 janvari, 2015 ko duusare sanskrit ayog kaa kaarykaal khatm ho gaya
 Its chairman was made Professor Satyavrat Shastri, who received the Jnanpith Award in Sanskrit
 17 disambar, 2015 ko en
 a panel led by Gopal Swamy was formed, which submitted the 32-page report in three months
 rashtriya sanskrit santhaan sidhaa maanav sansaadhan mantralay se sanchalit hota he
 In all its campuses
 40 se 50 fisadi shikshak nahin he
 In their place, about 200 teachers are teaching on contract
 jinamein se kai 15-15 saal se theke par padhaa rahe hai
 They are considered qualified to teach on contract but not for permanent work
 jab shikshak hi apane bhavishya ko lekar asurakshit hai to vah sanskrit kii asuraksha kaise dur karegaa
 Sushil Mahapatra spoke to the Vice Chancellor of the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan
 unke liye yah samasya saamaanya baat he or ise bhagwaan hi thik kar sakate hai
 The National Sanskrit Sansthan campuses are in Jammu, Allahabad, Delhi, Mumbai, Bhopal, Himachal Pradesh, Sringeri, Jaipur, Lucknow, Guruvayur, Puri and Agartala
 ye sanskrit kaa nayaa idara he magar yah bhi sanskrit ko aage nahin le sakaa
 The Jaipur campus has been in existence since 1983
 kul 900 chaatr hai or kareeb sau chaatr piechdi kar rahe hai
 a new diploma course combining Yoga and Ayurveda has also been launched here
 yahaan ke principal kaa kahana he ki is santhaan main shikshakon kii kami he magar lagan kii nahin
 He told that twenty students have passed the examination of Rajasthan Public Service Commission from their campus this year
 sanskrit se
 But everyone has compromised on teaching on contract, that is, half salary
 agar theke par rakhe gaye in shikshakon ke chaatr itnaa acha kar rahe hai, phir to unhen permanent kiya hi janaa chahie
 There are 34 permanent teachers and 37 on contract
 pareshaani aati he jahaan vishmata kaa bhav paidaa hota he usee kaa saathi utani hi yogyata rakhane vaala ek pe scale achchhakhaasa tankhwaah paa rahaa he
 The benefit of the pay commissions is getting the benefit of DA, on the other hand the person with the same qualifications is working on a certain amount of the same amount of labor, so you think that the design of human mind
 uske man main apane hi saathi, jo samaan kaary karne vaala he, ke prati kisi tarah kaa achachhaa bhav banegaa? prashasan ke upar acha bhav banegaa? vah chahega ki kisi tarah permanent ho jaae
 The courts are helping in this as happened in Himachal
 rashtriya sanskrit shiksha santhaan ke paas sanskrit ke vikaas ke liye puraa charter he
 Even after this, a second Sanskrit Commission was formed for the development of Sanskrit, whose report has been submitted at the time of NDA
 nae chairman kii report main kaha gaya he ki alag-alag rajyon main nai sanskrit uniwarsity ke liye ekamusth grant diya jaae
 Grant should be given for the skill development course in all Sanskrit universities
 aadhunik vishyon ko shuru karne ke liye vishesh rup se grant diya jaae
 Sanskrit atmosphere should be created in the campus
 saadhaaran sanskrit main shastron kii padhai ho
 Like Tamil, Hindi, Urdu University, subjects like history, social science, science and commerce should be taught
 biessi, emessi jaise course sanskrit main bhi bane
 All these improvements are given about Indian languages to create employment opportunities in them
 is baar ke bajet main hindi nideshaalay ke liye 46 karod die jane kaa prastaav to dikhaa he, sanskrit ke liye alag se grant kii ghoshnaa nazar nahin ai
 It seems that the report of the Second Sanskrit Commission has not been taken seriously
 agar aapako pataa ho ki upi ke phirozabad ke sirsaganj kasbe ke is sanskrit college kaa kya hoga, iske bare main sanskrit ayog main kuch nahin he
 There is nothing on what will happen to the lands or resources of the colleges which have been closed or are on the verge of closure
 arya gurukul sanskrit mahavidhyalay khandhar main badal chukaa he
 Seeing which corner of this building you would like to say hi-hi, kitchen or guesthouse or toilet
 rahane dijie
 Make India a world guru, keep chanting this slogan, everything will be alright with that
 80 ke dashak tak yahaan 300 ke kareeb chaatr hua karte the, is samay sirf 7 chaatr hai
 For this, there is a teacher whose salary is sent by the government and there are three employees
 saat chaatro ke liye ek shikshak
 It seems that no one is going to see how to use the government's resources better
 1978 main is santhaan ke sansthaapak kii zamin vivaad main hatya ho gai thi
 The comments in bekaar pade sansadhano kaa istemaal bhi sanskrit ke vikaas main ho saktaa tha, magar uske liye zaruri he ki kaam ho
 BJD MP from Puri Lok Sabha Pinaki Mishra had asked that in the last ten years the number of teachers teaching Sanskrit has come down drastically due to lack of job opportunities, is this correct? kya sanskrit chaatro kii sankhya main kami ai he
 Replying on 17 July 2017, Minister of State for Human Resources, Dr
 Mahendra Nath Pandey said that the Ministry does not keep a record of the number of teachers teaching Sanskrit in schools and colleges
 uplabdh soochna ke anusaar sanskrit shikshakon ke padon main koi kami nahin ai he
 What is there when the Ministry of Human Resources does not have a record of the number of teachers
 phir bhi mantri ji kah rahe hai ki sanskrit shikshakon ke padon main koi kami nahin ai he
 We have seen many places that Sanskrit teachers are few
 chaatro main bhi kami ai he
 Sampurnanand Sanskrit University of Banaras also has less Sanskrit teachers
 rashtriya sanskrit santhaan ke kulapati bhi maanate hai ki shikshak kam hai
 In 2012, the World Sanskrit Conference was held in Delhi
 isamen tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne rashtriya sanskrit santhaan ko antarrashtriya vishvavidhyalay ke str kaa banane kii baat kahi thi
 No one knows what happened to that goal
 usee samay sanskrit kii samasyaon or sambhaavnaaon par vichaar karne ke liye sanskrit ayog ke gathan kii baat hui thi jise do saal baad 10 janvari, 2014 ko puraa kar diya gaya
 On 9 January 2015, the term of the Second Sanskrit Commission came to an end
 iske chairman sanskrit bhashaa main gyanpith puraskaar praapt professor satyavrath shastri banaae gaye the
 On December 17, 2015, Ann
 gopal swami ke netritv main ek panel bana, jisane 32 pej kii report teen maheene main saunp di gai
 The Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan operates directly from the Ministry of Human Resources
 iske tamaam campus main
 40 to 50 percent are not teachers
 inaki jagah kareeb 200 shikshak theke par padhaa rahe hai
 Many of whom have been teaching on contract for 15-15 years
 ve theke par padhaane ke liye to yogya maane jate hai magar permanent karne ke liye nahin
 When the teacher is insecure about his future, how will he overcome the insecurity of Sanskrit
 rashtriya sanskrit santhaan ke kulapati se susheel mahapatra ne baat kii
 This problem is normal for them and only God can fix it
 rashtriya sanskrit santhaan ke campus jammu, elahabaad, dilli, mumbai, bhopal, himachal pradesh, shringery, jaipur, lakhanu, guruvayur, puri or agartalla main main hai
 This is the new Idara of Sanskrit but it also could not take Sanskrit further
 jaipur campus 1983 se hi kaayam he
 There are 900 students in total and around a hundred students are doing phd
 yahaan par yoga or ayurveda ko milakar ek nayaa diploma course bhi laanch kiya gaya he
 The principal here says that there is a shortage of teachers in this institute but not of dedication
 unhone bataaya ki unke campus se rajasthan public sarvice kamishan kii pariksha main is saal bees chaatro ne paas kiya he
 From Sanskrit
 magar sabane kantrect par yani aadhi tankhwaah par padhaane se samjhauta kar liya he
 If the students of these contractual teachers are doing so well, then they must be managed
 yahaan 34 permanent shikshak hai or 37 kantrect par
 Trouble arises where a sense of asymmetry arises, the partner of the same is earning a decent salary on a pay scale having equal merit
 vetan aayogon kaa laabh paa rahaa he die kaa laabh paa rahaa he, duusari taraf utani hi yogyata vaala vyakti utana hi shram vaala vyakti ek nishchit raashi par kaam kar rahaa he, to aap sochie ki manushya ke man kii banaavat
 Will there be any kind of good feeling in his mind towards his own partner, who is going to do the same thing? Will a good attitude prevail over the administration? He would like to become permanent
 court isamen sahaayak ho rahe hai jaisaa himachal main hua
 The National Institute of Sanskrit Education has a full charter for the development of Sanskrit
 iske baad bhi sanskrit ke vikaas ke liye doosraa sanskrit ayog bana, jisaki report endie ke samay jamaa hui he
 The report of the new chairman says that outright grants should be given for new Sanskrit universities in different states
 sabhi sanskrit uniwarsity main skill deveopment ke course ke liye grant diya jaae
 Special grants should be given to start modern subjects
 campus main sanskrit kaa vaataavaran banaaya jaae
 The scriptures should be studied in ordinary Sanskrit
 tamil, hindi, urdu uniwarsity kii tarah itihaas, samaaj vigyaan, vigyaan or vaanijya jaise vishay padhaaye jaaen
 Courses like b
sc, m
sc were also made in Sanskrit
 yahi saare sudhav bhartiya bhashaaon ke bare main die jate hai ki unamem rojgaar kii sambhaavna paidaa karo
 In this budget, a proposal to give 46 crores for the Hindi Directorate has been shown, but the announcement of a separate grant for Sanskrit was not visible
 lagata he ki duusare sanskrit ayog kii report ko gambhirtha se liya hi nahin gaya he
 If you know what will happen to this Sanskrit college in Sirsaganj town of Firozabad, UP, there is nothing in the Sanskrit Commission
 jo college band ho chuke hai yaa band hone ke kagaar par hai, unki zameenon yaa sansadhano kaa kya hoga, is par bhi kuch nahin he
 Arya Gurukul Sanskrit College has turned into ruins
