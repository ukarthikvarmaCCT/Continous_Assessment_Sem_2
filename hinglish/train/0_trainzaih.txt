 nitish ko lekar bihar kii mukhya vipakshi dal bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) sahit rajd nitish ko chaara ghotaale ke naam par gherne main koi kor kasar nahin chhodana chaahati
 Significantly, the Jharkhand High Court has directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to file an affidavit on the charges against Nitish Kumar and Shivanand Tiwari for taking money in the fodder scam case as to why the investigation should not take place against them? On Monday, Lalu Prasad was convicted by a special CBI court in a related case
 iske baad se teen oktober kaa din kaaphi ahm ho gaya he, jab unhen is maamle main sajaa sunai jaaegi
 This punishment will not only decide the direction of Lalu's political life, but people will also be able to get answers to many questions regarding his party RJD

 On the same day, the CBI is scheduled to hear the affidavit of the CBI which it will file in the case of Nitish and Shivanand

 It has also been said in the political circles that Nitish, who is usually aggressive on Lalu, did not react for the same reason even after Lalu was found guilty in the fodder scam

 The Congress has alleged an internal electoral alliance between the BJP and JDS leader Kumaraswamy
 congress kaa aarope he ki kumaraswami or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke bich dilli main mulaakaat hui thi
 There are also papers of Kumar Swamy coming to Delhi from a chartered plane on 13 April
 haalanki, devgauda ne saaf-saaf kaha he ki unki party kabhi bhi bijepi ke saath nahin jaaegi
 Match-fixing between BJP-JDS: Congress, senior Congress leader KC Venugopal said today that there is a contest between the incumbent Siddaramaiah government and the previous BS Yeddyurappa government in the assembly elections in Karnataka and Modi has little influence here
 unhone bijepi or purv pradhanmantri ech di devgauda kii jedies ke bich match phixing kaa aarope lagaaya
 Venugopal supported the allegation of party president Rahul Gandhi that Devgowda's party was the 'B team' of the BJP
 unhone kaha ki devgauda ke putr or purv mukhyamantriech di kumaraswamine siddharamaiya ko harwane kii manshaa se baar-baar chamundeshwari kaa daura kiya
 Chamundeshwari is also one of the two seats from which Siddaramaiah is contesting
 main ‘king’ banuunga, ‘kingmekar’ nahin : kumaraswamiech di kumaraswami kaa kahana he ki vah 'kingmekar' nahin banenge balki rajya ke log aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main unhen 'king' ke rup main aashirwad denge
 In fact pre-poll surveys predict a hung assembly in the state in which the JDS may emerge as a kingmaker
 karnataka kii 225 sadasyeey vidhansabha ke liye 12 may ko chunaav honge
 On Congress President Rahul Gandhi's allegation that the JDS is the 'B team' of the BJP, Kumaraswamy said that in his opinion Siddaramaiah is the 'B team' of the BJP
 kanpur ke paas hue bhayanak rail haadase ke 36 ghante baad railway board ne ek rivyuu meeting bulaai
 All 7 members of the Railway Board were present in this meeting convened under the leadership of Chairman Railway Board AK Mittal
 3 ghante tak chali is meeting main railway main sefti or security ko lekar uth rahe sawaalon par vichaar kiya gaya
 The board meeting also discussed about the horrific railway accident near Kanpur, in view of the developments in this railway accident, the Railway Board took many important decisions
 in faislon main sabase bada faisla yah he ki german technology ke alechabi coach kaa utpaadan teji se badhaayaa jayega or saath hi maujuuda isief kochon main saaku kapler yaa sibisi kapler lagaae jaaenge
 According to a senior railway official, the decision was taken to strengthen the railway safety wing and it was said in the meeting that from time to time, safety audit of different divisions and railway corridors will be done from time to time
 Will go
 sefti audit main sambandhit railway coridor ke tamaam pahaluon ke bare main tathypurna jaankaree jutai jaaegi or iske liye uchit suzav bhi die jaaenge
 In order to reduce the risk of railway accidents, the Railway Board has decided that no new trains will be run on those routes which are being used 100 percent
 railway board kii meeting main indore patna express main istemaal kiye gaye isief coach ke bare main bhi charchaa hui
 According to experts, the biggest reason behind the number of people who died in the train accident near Kanpur is that ICF coaches built on old technology are installed in it
 in coach kii takanic outdated he
 In the event of an accident, such coaches climb on top of each other and break each other, something similar has happened in the rail accident near Kanpur
 deshbhar main chalane vaali sabhi trainon main 53 hajaar isief coach hai
 Therefore, the Railway Board has decided to change the couplings in ICF coaches
 These coaches will be fitted with either Saku coupler or CBC coupler
 iske alaava railway board kii meeting main deshbhar main sabhi rail patariyon kii sahi jaanch ke liye ultrasonic fla detector patariyon ke kinare lagaae jane kaa faisla bhi liya gaya he
 According to experts, due to the installation of sensors of this technology along the side of the rail tracks across the country, the railway will be able to get timely information about any breakage in the tracks, so that such horrific accidents can be avoided
 The cost of installing an ultrasonic detector on the side of every kilometer of rail track will be Rs 8 to 10 lakhs
 isi ke saath railway coridor kii marammat ke liye mentanence block kii jaankaree railway time teble main di jaaegi
 In the time period of the maintenance block, the movement of trains in the concerned railway corridor will be stopped and the railway track will be opened only after the complete repair is there

 aakhir kya he diene kii puri ladaai kii siyaasi vajah?bataa den ki india today state of state conklev main shanivaar ko mukhyamantri nitish kumaar se upendra kushvaha dwaara unke bare main die gaye bayaan par pratikriya maangi to unhone (nitish) kaha tha ki kahaan sawaal- jawaab kaa str itnaa neeche le rahe hai
 Upendra Kushwaha's attitude has become very strict on this matter of Nitish
 unhone nitish kumaar par ravivaar ko nishaanaa sadhate hue unase poocha ki pradesh kii janata aap se yah jaananaa chaahati he ki aapke 'diene' kii report kya he or vah aayi yaa nahin aayi
 What is the report if you come, please tell me? Upendra Kushwaha has not limited this statement to DNA only, but has linked it with dalit-obc
 unhone kaha ki nitish kumaar ji mujhe 'neech' kehete hai
 i want to ask the elder brother Nitish Kumar from this forum that Upendra Kushwaha is 'low' because he wants to make Dalit-backward and poor youth judges in the Supreme Court
 unhone kaha, 'ham pichhadaa-ati pichde kii baton or unke hiton ko uthaate hai isliye neech hai
 Upendra Kushwaha is mean when talking about social justice
 garib ghar ke bachche kaise padhein, iske liye abhiyaan chalaate he to kya upendra kushvaha iske liye neech he?'haalanki kushvaha jis tarah se diene ke jariye nitish kumaar ko gherne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Similarly, at the Parivartan rally in Muzaffarpur before the 2015 elections, it was said that Kumar's DNA was something wrong
 piem ke is bayaan par nitish kumaar is bijepi or modi ko gherne ke liye bihar asmita ke mudde ko uthaaya tha
 Just before Bihar assembly elections 2015, Nitish Kumar had sent samples of millions of hair of Bihar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 modi par tanj kasate hue nitish ne tab kaha tha ki is sample se ve bihar ke logon kaa diene test kar len
 BJP was on the back foot with Nitish's stakes
 vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan bijepi ko nuksaan bhi uthaanaa padaa tha
 However, Kushwaha now wants to defeat him politically by Nitish's stakes
 bihar main endie ke bich seat bantwaare ko lekar kushvaha khush nahin he
 He is not willing to accept fewer seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha than in the previous elections
 darasal, kushvaha ke paas donon vikalp khule hai
 On the one hand, he is still in the NDA
 vahiin duusari ore tejasvi yadav bhi khule taur par unhen aamantrit kar chuke hai
 This is the reason why Kushwaha is trying to hit the spot on the spot
 isliye vah samay kii najaakat ko samajhate hue diene ke mudde ko uthaa rahe hai
 Upendra Kushwaha sometimes praises Nitish Kumar and sometimes speaks against him
 yahi vajah he ki raajnneetik pandit yah kehete hai ki upendra kushvaha clymex kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 Only then will he open his political cards
 sutron kii maane to, philhal amit shah or nitish kumaar ke bich sahmati ye hui he ki jediu or bijepi 17-17 siton par chunaav ladengi
 At the same time Ram Vilas Paswan's party LJP will be given 4 seats and Upendra Kushwaha's RLSP will get 2 seats
 haalanki pichley loksabhaa chunaav main algepi ko 7 siten milin thim
 At the same time, Upendra Kushwaha's party had won 3 seats and Kushwaha's party had won these three seats
 yahi vajah he ki upendra kushvaha endie main rahete hue lagaataar bayaan de rahe hai

 The 14-month-old congress-jd (S) government fell on Tuesday after losing the confidence vote in the assembly
 iske baad mukhyamantriech di kumaraswami ne istipha de diya
 Yeddyurappa told reporters after meeting RSS leaders at his state headquarters' Keshav Kripa 'here,' i am waiting for instructions from Delhi
 main kisi bhi vakt vidhayak dal kii baithak bula saktaa hum or (daawa pesh karne ke liye) rajbhavan ja saktaa hum
 i am waiting for this 'unhone kaha ki yah rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke aashirwad or sahyog se hi sambhav hua he ki vah mukhyamantri banane ke liye taluk se rajya str tak pahunche
 He said that i have come here to seek blessings from the elders of the Sangh Parivar before taking the next step
 sarkaar banane ke sambandh main yediurppa ko manjuuri dene ke liye buudhvaar ko dilli main bhaajapa sansadeey board kii baithak hone kii sambhaavna he
 Senior BJP MLA JC Madhuswamy said that the party's national president Amit Shah would have to give us directions to call a meeting of the legislature party to elect the leader in the presence of an observer
 unhone kaha ki chunki ham rashtriya party he to chijen loktantric tareeke se honi chahie, isliye ham unke nirdeshon kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 After this, time will be sought to meet the Governor
 gauratlab he ki vidhansabha main shakti pareekshan main kumaraswami ko bhaajapa ke 105 maton ke mukaable 99 vot hi mili
 At least six people are feared dead and 10 evacuated due to the fire in a double-storeyed factory in New Ranjit Nagar area of central Delhi
 damakal vibhaag ke adhikariyon ne bataaya ki unhen shaam 5 bajkar 50 minute par aag lagane kii soochna mili
 Seven fire engines were then sent to the scene but it took three hours to extinguish the fire
 damakalkarmiyon ne bataaya ki shuruaati jaanch se pataa chalaa he ki aag bijli kaa short circuit hone se lagi
 According to an eyewitness, when there was a fire on the ground floor of the factory building located in a crowded area, there were many workers in the factory
 iske baad duusare manjilon par bhi aag lag gai or kamaron main dhuaan bhar gaya
 By the time fire engine vehicles reached here, the entire building was engulfed in flames
 der shaam tak yahaan raahat evam bachaav abhiyaan jari tha
 a police officer said that investigation into the incident is on
 pet main bhukh ke maare chuuhe kudane or chuhon ke kabddi khilne kii kahavatein to aam hai, lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki asal main pet main chuuhe nahin balki bacteria kabddi karte hai
 You have a desire to reduce obesity, but you cannot stop yourself from eating fat and fatty food? In fact, it is not due to your tongue but due to bacteria found in your stomach
 ek taaja adhyayan main saamne aayaa he ki hamaare pet main paae jane vaale bacteria hamaare dimag ko niyantrit karte hai or kuch vishesh khaadya padaarthon ke prati hamaari ruchi jagaate hai
 In a study published in the latest issue of the science journal 'bioassays', researchers have said that the 'microbes' found in the stomach of humans affect the eating interests of humans
 vastav main ye microbs manushyon ko aisi chijen khaane ke liye prerit karte hai jinase unhen panpane main zyada madad mili
 Carlo Malle of the University of California, San Francisco, USA, stated in his paper, "the bacteria found in our intestines affect our eating habits
" ’ anusandhankartaaon ke anusaar, maanav kii aant main paae jane vaale microbiom main maanav kii bhojan sambandhi ruchiyon se jude jeevanu maujuud rahete hai jo kuch vishesh padaarthon kaa srav kar bhojan ko lekar hamaare nirnay ko prabhavit karne vaale sanket preshit karte hai
 Since our intestine is also connected to our immune system, endocrine system and nervous system, the signals released by these bacteria in the intestine also affect our physiological and behavioral responses
 anusandhankartaaon ne haalanki yah bhi kaha he ki in jeevanuon dwaara saralata se pachaae ja sakane vaale padaarthon ko na khaakar in jeevanuon kii anukulata ko prabhavit kiya ja saktaa he
 By doing this we can make changes to the microbiome in 24 hours
 anushaasan or niyamon kaa dambh bharne vaali shivasena main bhai-bhatijawad or chatukaarikta kii raajnneeti paravaan chadh rahi he
 The pain of this thing also spilled into the speeches of Maharashtra's animal husbandry minister on a public platform
 unhone party pramukh kii maujuudagi main party kii andar kii baton ko sabhi ke saamne rakhte hue kataaksh bhi kiya, 'shivasena main chaay se zyada kai kettliyaan garam hai
 ' gulabrav patil ne apane bhaashan main kaha ki ab din chunaav ke hai
 Ticket distribution should be very careful
 lekin, ho ye rahaa he ki tikat dete vakt koun apana, koun paraayaa zyada dekha ja rahaa he
 Because there are more kettles than tea
 tippaniyan Patil's clear stance was on the part of the leaders who, while giving candidature in the election, preferred the worker's loyalty to himself rather than loyalty to the party
 aise netaaon ko patil ne do took kaha ki shivasena se jis-jisane beyimaani kii unhen uski keemat chukaani padi he
 Significantly, during this statement, Shiv Sena party chief Uddhav Thackeray was present on the stage
 apane bhaashan main unhone bhi gulabrav patil ke bayaan kaa samarthan kiya
 Gulabrao Patil said in his speech that now the days are for elections
 tikat bantwaaraa bahut sanbhalkar hona chahie
 But, it has been seen that who is seen more than who is giving tickets, who is alien
 kyonki yahaan chaay se zyada kettliyaan garam ho chuki hai
 The comments patil kaa saafe rukh un netaaon kii taraf tha jo chunaav main ummidavaari dete hue party ke saath nishtha ke bajaae kaaryakarta kii khud kii taraf nishtha ko ehmiyat dete hai
 Patil bluntly told such leaders that he had to pay the price for the dishonesty of the Shiv Sena
 gauratlab he ki is bayaanbazi ke dauraan shivasena ke party pramukh uddhav thakare manch par maujuud the
 In his speech, he also supported Gulabrao Patil's statement

 ab congress ne is ghatana kii aalochana kii he
 The Tamil Nadu unit of the Congress on Sunday said the incident of not allowing a High Court judge to enter a club in the state's traditional dhoti dhoti is regrettable

 jab vah hoicourt ke purv mukhya nyaayadhish ties arunachalam dwaara yojit pustak vimochan samaaroh main bhaag lene ke liye club ke parisar main apni sarkari gaadi se utre, to club ke kuch karmchaariyon ne unhen bataaya ki vah dhoti pahanakar club ke andar nahin ja sakate, kyonki unhen bade adhikariyon se nirdesh mili hai ki club ke dress code kaa paalan nahin karne vaale logon ko club main nahin jane diya jaae
 The judge described the incident as 'unfortunate'
 gyandeshikan ne kaha ki agar club ke liye koi dress code tha, to yah un logon ke liye badhyakaari nahin tha, jo uske sadsy nahin hai
 He also called for the club to abolish such rules

 landan ke is fishan brands ke sath pop star rihana bhi judi huin hai
 The fashion brand was recently launched at Lakme Fashion Week 2014, during which Kriti Shannon walked the ramp and showcased the brand's collection
 lackme fishan wyk main jalwe bikheratin jaclynais brands se judane par kriti ne kaha, 'ham sab jaanate hai ki rihana ek style ikon hai or aise brands ke saath judana jiske saath rihana pehle se judi hui hai, mere liye bahut badi baat he

 india today kii ek khabar ne khandwa ke adivasee block khalwa ke saikadon bipiel pariwaron ko unka swabhimaan waapas dilvaaya he
 To identify these families, the government had written 'I am poor' in bold letters on their homes
 ye parivaar pichley dhai saal se is ibaarat kaa boj uthaa rahe the or garibi ke saath-saath uske kalank kii pidaa bhi jhel rahe the
 When India Today raised this agony of BPL families in the August 29, 2012 issue, the administration and administration realized their mistake
 fouran karrwai karte hue khandwa ke colector niraj dube ne teen din ke bheetar hi tamaam makaanon par likhi yah ibaarat mitaane ke nirdesh die
 Dubey says, "ever since this matter came to my notice, i had made up my mind to erase it
" ”jab hamane in gaanvon kaa dobaaraa daura kiya to halaat badale hue hi nahin balki behad khushnuma lage
 Smile was blossoming on extinguished faces
 sabase sukhad asar gaanv fefri sarkaar main dekhne ko mila
 The family of Sunil Singh here was so sad to see the words "I am poor" written at home that he had named his young child disappointed
 lekin ibaarat ke mitate hi is ghar se maayusi dur ho gai or khushiyon ne dastak deni shuru kar di
 Now the name of Desperate has been changed
 is nanhe bachche kii maa babitha kahati hai, ''ab ham use aayush kahenge
 "even though the white wall of Jamlikurd's Rukhsana's house may have become discolored when the grandson is gone from black, he is happy
 khushi he ki unke maathe par laga garibi kaa kalank aakhirkaar mit gaya he
 70-year-old Baskar Bai did not believe at first that the government had removed this matter
 lekin ab unki ankhon kii chamak se pataa chalata he ki ve kitni khush hai
 a new hope has arisen in the BPL families as soon as the matter disappears
 bhuribai bharosa jataati hai, ''jis tarah yah ibaarat miti he usee tarah ek din hamaari garibi bhi mit jaaegi
 Social activist Abhay Jain credits India Today for bringing a smile on the face of these people
 bipiel suchi main naam darj karaane kii keemat in pariwaron ne apana swabhimaan sarkaar ke paas girvee rakhkar chukaai thi
 The government could not eradicate their poverty but by erasing this text written on their homes, they have definitely rectified their mistake
 jaisaa ki khalwa janapad ke mukhya karypalan adhikari bi
 K
 shukla kehete hai, ''is ibaarat se garibon ke swabhimaan ko chot pahunchi hogi lekin prashasan ne apni galati sudhaar lee he” jaahir he, maayusi ke badal chantane lage hai

 Because this crisis is the biggest contract before Mulayam Singh
 96 ghante se chachaa, bhattije ke bich upji raar thamane kaa naam nahin le rahi he
 72 hours later, after Mulayam Singh's intervention, it seemed that the matter was going to improve but it worsened

 If sources are to be believed, Shivpal does not see anything in this meeting and comes back and resigns from the family and cabinet
 iske baad shuru hota he sapa or lakhanu main shivpal ke ghar ke baahar hivoltage drama
 
 
 
 1
 As soon as the news of the resignation was leaked, there was a crowd of supporters outside Shivpal's house and shouted slogans forcefully

 Shivpal's supporters include mlas, ministers, street and village leaders

 The Supreme Court has dismissed a petition by Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG regarding the patent for the anti-cancer drug Glivec
 nyaayamurti aftab alam tathaa ranjana prakaash desai kii peeth ne novartis kii yachika khaarij kar di
 Read: The gene responsible for the cancer was found! The company challenged the decision of the Intellectual Property Appellate Board, which rejected the petition to patent the drug
 yah dawa rakt cancer va anya prakaar ke cancer ke ilaaj main istemaal kii jaati he
 In 2006, Novartis' petition was dismissed by the Intellectual Property Appellate Board in Chennai
 ise chunauti dene vaali novartis kii yachika par sarvocch nyaayalay ke nirnay ko lekar kai antarrashtriya dawa companiyon kii najar tiki hui thi

 Most of us like to eat samosa in the evening
 barsaat ke mausam main to log ye kahkar samosa order karte hai ki aaj barish hui he or samosa khaane kaa mausam he
 But you will be sad to know that the samosas that you eat by making so much fervor and excuses can prove to be dangerous for you
 darasal, samose kii upree parat maide kii bani hoti he
 You must have heard the elders in your house saying that consuming more flour makes the stomach worse
 par kya aap ye nahin jaananaa chahenge ki unke aisa kehane kii vajah kya he? maide se hone vaale nuksaan ko jaanane se pehle ye jaananaa bahut jaruri he ki maida banataa kaise he?kaise banataa he maida:maida bhi gehun se hi banataa he
 Just as wheat has to be cleaned thoroughly for flour, in the same way wheat is first washed thoroughly for fine flour
 iske baad gehun kii upree tah hataa lee jaati he
 After this, the white part of wheat is grinded very finely
 pisai ke baad praapt chikna or bilkul maheen powder hi maida hota he
 Disadvantages of Eating Flour: Flour is made from wheat
 ek ore jahaan gehun koswasthya ke liye acha mana jaataa haveheen maide ko khatarnaak
 The main reason for this is that while making maida, the upper peel of wheat is removed
 jisase uskaa fibre nikal jaataa he
 In such a situation, there is no carditory fiber in it, so when one consumes the ingredients made from fine flour, it is not fully digested
 sahi se pachan na ho paane ke kaaran iskaa kuch hissaa aanton main hi chipak jaataa he or kai tarah kii bimariyon kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 Consumption of it often leads to constipation
 saath hi maida bahut adhik maatra main tel bhi sokhta he
 Excessive intake of oil causes heaviness
 aise main koshish kii jaani chahie ki maide se bani chizon kaa kam se kam seven karen
 The Delhi High Court has refused to ban the audi-even car formula being implemented by the Kejriwal government on January 1 to curb rising pollution in Delhi
 haalanki court ne sarkaar se kaha he ki vah viklaangon kii chintaaon par vichaar kare
 The case will now be heard on 6 January
 adaalat ne yah faisla ek yachika kii sunwaayee karte hue diya
 Kejriwal sought help from PM Modi, before this, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and requested him to cooperate in implementing the aud-even formula
 unhone patr ke jariye piem se mantriyon or saansadon ko iske liye prerit karne ko kaha tha
 Kejriwal wrote- 'as you know air pollution in Delhi has taken the form of a huge problem
 ham sabhi iske liye uttaradaayi hai or ham sab milakar hi iskaa hal nikaal sakate hai
 After the presentation to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, a guideline has been made to implement it
 dilli ke parivahan mantri gopal raay ne ise lagu karne ko lekar aupchaarik ghoshnaa kii thi
 audi-even formula will be applicable in Delhi from January 1, people of Delhi may have to pay a fine of two thousand rupees from 1st January on breaking the odd-even rule
 kejariwal sarkaar ke transport vibhaag ne od-evan ke 15 din ke trial ke dauraan yah niyam todane par do hajaar rupee jurmaane kaa prastaav diya he
 6 thousand additional buses to be run Kejriwal government claimed that 6 thousand additional buses will be run on the capital roads between 1 to 15 January by implementing the odd-even formula
 dilli main 1 janvari se hi od-ivan formula lagu hoga, jo subah 8 baje se shaam 8 baje tak ravivaar ko chhodkar baaki din lagu hoga
 This is the formula - audi-even Car Formula will be implemented from January 1 - Trial of the formula will run from 1 to 15 January - The formula will be applicable from 8 am to 8 pm - Trains will run according to the date - 1, 3 , Odd number trains on 5th - Even numbers will run on 2, 4, 6, 8 - Blueprint will be prepared before 25th December - Satendra Jain will be the nodal officer for this scheme
 -15 ke baad samiksha hogi or phir aage kii ruparekha banegi
 The retired paramilitary forces and their associated organizations are marching towards Delhi on March 3 to demand pension
 inaki maang he ki nai pension yojana ko khatm kar puraani yojana lagu kii jaae
 Although paramilitary forces have been fighting for this for a long time, but their demand has increased in the last few months
 iske alaava vipaksh kii ore se bhi ardhsainik balon samet anya sarkari karmchaariyon ko unki is maang ke liye samarthan mil rahaa he
 In this regard, Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also met a delegation of employee organizations in Uttar Pradesh in the past
 unhone is dauraan puraani pension vyavastha bahaali ke mudde ko agle loksabhaa chunaav ke liye party ke ghoshnaptr main shaamil karne kaa aashwaasan diya
 Not only this, Priyanka immediately sent a letter about this to the Congress manifesto committee
 lekin sawaal he ki kya congress is maang ko puri kar sakati he
 The question is that even if this demand is met, the government treasury will be burdened
 aasaan nahin he puraani pension yojanajankaron kii maane to puraani pension kii bahaali ab aasaan nahin he kyonki sarkaar par uske kaaran baari boj padana tay he
 This is the reason why the government has been improving the NPS in the last few years and has added many things which were not in the old scheme
 beete saal kendriya vitt rajya mantri shiv pratap shukla nen loksabhaa main ek likhit jawaab main bataaya ki pension dendariyaan bad rahi hai or ve ansasteneble ho gai hai
 a total of 1,56,641 on pension giving during the year 2017-18
 29 karod rupee kharch kiye gaye hai
 During this, he also informed that the Central Government has increased its stake in the new pension scheme from 10% to 14%
 is vajah se 2019-20 main kendriya kosh par 2,840 karod rupee kaa atirikt boj padegaa
 This means that it will not be easy for the incoming governments to implement the old pension scheme

 Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi took a tough stand amid reports of his resignation saying that it is his responsibility to pass the Railway Budget
 vahiin unhen hataane kii trinmul congress kii maangon ke silsile main sansad ke donon sadanon main guuruuvaar ko hangaamaa hua or sarkaar ne kaha rail mantri ne abhi istipha nahin diya he
 On reports that another leader of his own party, Mukul Roy, was appointed as Railway Minister in place of Trivedi, the Prime Minister told reporters in Parliament, "if there is such a thing, we will consider it
" ’ isse pehle loksabhaa main sadan ke netaa pranav mukherjee ne kaha, ‘rail mantri ne istipha nahin diya he
 The Prime Minister has received a message from Trinamool Congress President Mamata Banerjee, which is being actively considered
 ’haalanki trivedi ne istife ke sawaal par samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘railway bajet ko paarit karaane kii jimmedaari meri he or maine sansad main bajet pesh kiya

 ab yah sansad kii sampatti he or sadan ko is par vichaar karnaa he
 'trinamool Congress leader Sudip Bandopadhyay said,' Trinamool never asked Dinesh Trivedi to resign

 Congress spokesperson Rashid Alvi told reporters in the Parliament complex that Trivedi is still the Railway Minister and the Parliament will decide on the Rail Budget, which is tabled tomorrow
 maa-beti ke rishte ko taar-taar karti ek vaardaat saamne ai he
 When a mother from Faridabad suspected her daughter's conduct, she got her own daughter killed and that too through a policeman
 iske baad usne naatak bhi rach diya
 Actually, a woman named Pushpa filed a case on December 28 for the murder of her daughter Kiran
 apni shikaayat main is mahila ne kaha tha ki burka pahane do ladkiyaan uske ghar ain or unhone hi kiran kii hatya kar di
 During the questioning, the police suspected Pushpa
 jab poochtacha gahanta se kii gai to puspa tut gai or puri kahani police ko bataa di
 According to police, Pushpa was suspicious of the conduct of her daughter Kiran, who worked in a real estate office in Noida
 puspa ne apane rishtedaar kulwinder ko kiran kii hatya ke liye bulaayaa tha, jo apane saath ek or saathi ko bhi laayaa tha
 Kulwinder is said to be a constable of Punjab Police
 kulwinder or uskaa saathi ab bhi police kii giraft se baahar hai
 Police say Pushpa chose the day for the murder when her husband and son were out of the house

 Police say Pushpa had tried to kill her daughter two days before Diwali in which she failed
 sansad kii ek samiti ne sarkaar se ek niamak ke taur par kendriya bank kii javabdehi se jude muddon par gaur karne ke vaaste ek samiti banane kaa aagrah kiya he
 Along with this, the committee has asked the Reserve Bank to relax the capital adequacy norms for banks and review the prompt corrective action
 sansad kii vittiya maamalon kii sthaayee samiti (the standing committee on finance) ne arabiai ko is baat kaa aankalan karne ko bhi kaha he ki dhokhadhadi se nipatane ke liye uske dwaara banaae gaye disha-nirdesh kitne prabhavi rahe hai
 a committee headed by senior Congress leader m Veerappa Moily has also suggested raising the retirement age of heads of public sector banks to 70 years
 iske alaava sarkari swaamitv vaale bainkon main shrambal or maanav sansaadhan ke uchit prabandhan kaa paraamarsh bhi diya gaya he
 The report of the committee was laid on the floor of the Parliament on Thursday
 arabiai dwaara puunji paryaaptta (capital adequacy norms) ko besil teen kii vaishvik ruparekha ke tahat nirdisht seemaa se adhik rakhane ke nirnay par sawaal uthaate hue samiti ne kaha kikendriya bankne karj dene kii kshamta ko simit kar diya he or sarkaar par saarvajanik kshetra ke bainkon main puunji daalane ke bhaar ko badha diya he
 The committee said that it has been informed that Basel rules apply to internationally active banks and 9 public sector banks are not internationally active
 iske alaava adhiktar puraane sarkari bank bhi antarrashtriya str par sakriy nahin rahe hai
 As of March 2018, 9 banks have close to 9 figures
 93 lakh karod rupee mulya kii jokhim vaali puunji he
 With this, these banks will need additional funds of about Rs 35,000 crore
 in 9 bainkon main central bank of india, andhra bank, obisi, corporation bank, vijaya bank, bank of maharashtra, united bank of india, dena bank or punjab and sindh bank shaamil hai
 The committee said in its report, 'for our banks, such stringent rules laid down by RBI are unrealistic and unfair
 ' sansadeey samiti ne kaha ki in 9 bainkon ke liye atirikt puunji aavashyaktaa ko rakhaa gaya he
 If this relieves them, then 5 from these banks
 34 lakh karod rupee kii baari bharkam raashi bazaar main jari ho sakati he
 By doing this, the loan amount of these banks can increase up to 51 percent
 yah karj bazaar main jane se in bainkon ko 50,000 karod rupee tak kaa atirikt byaaj mil saktaa he
 These banks have been placed under prompt corrective action by Reserve Bank
 isse in bainkon par kai tarah ke karj pratibandh laga die gaye hai
 The new rules of the rbi's PCA (prompt corrective action) were implemented in 2017
 iske tahat bainkon kii teen mandandon par nigaraanee kii jaati he, jiske tahat bainkon kii puunji paryaaptta, shuddh gaiyr-nishpadit raashi (enpie) or sapatti par milane vaala pratifal aadi ko dekha jaataa he
 The committee fears that more and more public sector banks will come under these PCA rules of the Reserve Bank
 bangaleru membijapi kii kaaryakarini kii baithktay vakt par khatm ho gai
 The round of speculation which began on the speech of the senior most leader of the Margadarsha Mandal, Lal Krishna Advani, came in the form of a new proposition through the rumors - 'the guidance board can guide anytime
 yah uskaa adhikaar he
 Speaking or not speaking from the stage does not matter much
 'adwani ab kam bolte hai
 Most people refrain from speaking
 haa, jab 'man kii baat' kerani ho to blog he naa
 We are sharing with you the post of Advani which could never be published
 "baat 1980 kii he
 The date was April 6 - today
 maine or atal ji ne ek sapana dekha tha
 Over time we moved forward
 sadak par chaar saal ke safar ke baad bhi sansad main ham do kadam hi chal sake
 Then more people joined our dream
 hamaare sapane kaa dayera badhata gaya
 It will be about 22 years
 sapane ko hakeekat main badalane ke liye ham padaav dar padaav chalate rahe
 Atal ji was always strict about Rajdharma
 raaj dharm ko lekar atal ji kaa jo najariya tha, main bhi usase puraa ittefaq rakhata tha
 Simply, i favored its practical side
 raaj dharm ke raste ham sapane ko puraa hote dekhte rahe
 But some people will get involved in fulfilling their dreams through the path of Rajdharma - i did not even think that in my dream
 sapane dekhnaa har kisi kaa haq he
 You have a dream apane sapane ko puraa kiya
 That's right
 khud ke liye sapane dekhnaa vyakti kaa adhikaar hota he, isamen kisi ko shaayad hi kabhi etraj hoga
 If you dream for society then it is your duty
 agar aap desh ke liye sapane dekhte hai to yah aapaki jimmedaari he
 It is also your duty to inspire someone else to dream
 aam logon ko sapane dekhne ke liye prerit karnaa ek badi jimmedaari he
 Now if you show dreams to others then it is a good thing
 sapane dikhaane ke saath hi use puraa karne main madad karte hai to ye or acchhee baat he
 If you show dreams to others to fulfill your dreams
 or apana sapana puraa hone ke baad use doosraa sapana dikhaate hai
 After that, each time you move your dream destination forward - and keep showing others new dreams
 aap kabhi poochhate bhi nahin ki unka kya hua jinhen aapane sapane dikhaae the
 You do not even have to know how many dreams you have shown to me
 Later on you can say that there was no such thing as dreams - they were electoral jokes
 sapane dikhaanaa acchhee baat he
 It is a bad thing to straighten your owl by showing dreams
 phir chit-fund companiyon or aap main fark kya bachaa? ve bhi to sapane hi bechate hai
 If people do not do it, then who will call it a rumor in peace? It is a bad thing to call someone a merchant of death
 magar kisi ke bare main kisi kii nijee raay yah ho sakati he
 No deal is bad, bad is the motive behind the deal
 ab koi sapanom kaa kaarobaar karne lage to use kya kaha jaae?agar saude ke peeche kisi kii niyat saaf nahin he to sapanom ke saudagar or maut ke saudagar main koi khaas fark nahin bachataa
 Then when a private opinion becomes a general opinion, it is not even known
 sapane dekhnaa kabhi khatarnaak nahin hota
 Dreaming is also not as dangerous
 baat jab sapanom kii hoti he to pash khud-ba-khud usamen shariq ho jate hai
 'the most dangerous is the dying of dreams'
 or jab sari hadein paar ho jaaen - to usase bhi khatarnaak hota he khud ke sapanom ke liye dusron ke sapanom kaa galaa ghont dena
 Keep in mind, this is not an election jumla

 In Jammu and Kashmir, the BJP suddenly withdrew support to the PDP and broke the coalition that had been running for nearly three years
 bijepi ne ise rashtrahit main liya gaya faisla bataaya he
 bjp's partner PDP was not even aware of this decision of BJP
 pidipi netaa mahabuuba mufti ne siem pad se istipha de diya he
 After this development, the leader of the main opposition National Conference in the state and former CM of the state, Omar Abdullah met Governor NN Vohra
 is mulaakaat ke baad umr ne kaha ki vah pidipi ko samarthan dekar sarkaar banane nahin ja rahe hai
 He said that his party has not got the mandate to run the government
 haalanki, umr kii yah baat unke pichley stand se alag he
 After the results of the state assembly elections came out in 2014, Omar Abdullah tried to form a government with both BJP and PDP
 haalanki unki baat kisi se nahin bani
 Let us know what are the reasons for Omar Abdullah not forming a government with the PDP
 1- PDP-BJP kakaanton kaa taj kyon pahanembijapi ne pidipi se gathbandhan isliye todaa, kyonki is sarkaar ke shasankaal main adhikansh samay rajya ashaant hi rahaa
 The situation in the state has worsened since Burhan Wani's encounter
 aise main umr abdulla kaa bijepi or pidipi kaa banaaya kaanton kaa taj pahananaa bevakoofi hi hoti
 On coming to the government, he would also have to face criticism of the works of the previous government
 2- apnijameen ganvaane kaa khatranational conference jammu-kashmir kii raajnneeti main hi sakriy he
 The PDP is its main rival party here
 umr abdulla rajya ke pichley siem the
 In such a situation, joining hands with the PDP is no less than surrendering to his opponent
 aisa ek gathbandhan uttar pradesh main dekhne ko mila, jahaan bijepi ke khilaaf sapa or basapa ne haath milaayaa he
 In such an alliance, a party will have to be ready to lose its land
 umr jammu main aisa nahin karnaa chaahate
 3-how to go with whom Kausouse Omar Abdullah has been questioning the decisions of BJP and PDP government since the formation of the government
 isamen vah pakistani seemaa par badhati aatanki ghatnaon, centre sarkaar ke faisle, sena ke kai encounter or major gogoi ke kashmiri yuvakon ko maanav dhaal banane jaise faislon kii bhi aalochana kar chuke hai
 In such a situation, the government which he has been criticizing, it is not right for his politics to go with the PDP
 rajya main jamini str par donon partiyon ke kaaryakarta bhi iske liye taiyaar nahin ho pate
 4- Why lose your place in UPA / Grand Alliance National Conference has been a partner of UPA
 congress ne 2008 main rajya vidhansabha chunaavon main neshnal conference kaa samarthan bhi kiya tha
 Only after this, Omar Abdullah became the youngest CM of the state
 is samay neshnal conference 2019 main loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye ban rahe mahagathbandhan kaa bhi hissaa he
 Omar Abdullah attended Sonia Gandhi's dinner party in Delhi some time ago
 pidipi ne 2008 main upie se apana naata tod liya tha
 In such a situation, just before the Lok Sabha elections, Omar Abdullah does not want to go out of the grand alliance with the PDP
 5- aadhe samay ke liesatta main kyon aaenjammu-kashmir main vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal 6 saal ke liye hota he
 The PDP-BJP government was formed in March 2015
 aise main yahaan par sarkaar ko kareeb dhai saal ho gaye hai
 If there is a governor's rule for six months, the government's time would have been left for about half the time in the state
 neshnal conference ke ganit ke hisaab se pidipi-bijepi kii sarkaar ke alokapriy shashan ko sanvaarane ke liye itnaa samay kaaphi nahin hota
 For Omar's politics, it is better to prepare for the new elections counting the failures of the current government

 Wherever i went, the farmers are ready to give their land but are asking about their rights

 Everyone knows what is the result of such relations
 sangeeta varshney ne khud hi kaha ki yuvati apni umr 18 saal bataa rahi he jabaki uski umr 16 saal se zyada nahin lagati
 In the midst of this uproar, the family members including the woman's father were also called on the spot

 The Public Relations Department (ISPR) of the Pakistan Army has released these videos on the occasion of Security and Martyrdom Day

 Including these terrorists in the video made by the Pakistan Army in the name of nationalism, it has given proof that how these terrorists have the patronage of the Pakistan Army
 pakistan or pakistani sena ko deshbhakti vaale video banane kaa haq he lekin kashmir main aatanki bhej kar aatankwaad failaana or phir uskaa istemaal pakistan ke khokhale rashtrawaad ko mahimamandit karne ke liye karnaa ek aatanki desh hi kar saktaa he
 Even after the encounter of Hizbulkamandur Burhan Wani in Jammu and Kashmir, the youth of the valley are going on the path of terror but the link of these recruitments is definitely with Burhan Wani
 8 july 2016 ko burhan kii hatya ke baad 35 se zyada yuvaaon ne aatanki sanghathan hijbul kaa rukh kiya he or inaki bhartee ke peeche nayaa chalan dekhne ko mila he
 According to the news published in the English newspaper Indian Express, after gathering information related to his family and friends about these youths who joined Hizbul after the Burhan encounter, it was found that he was somehow influenced by Burhan's death
 akhbaar ke haath lagi report main kaha gaya ki in yuvaaon ko burhan kii maut ne hijbul main daakhil hone ke liye prabhavit kiya
 Most of the encounters have been done before this terrorist could become a challenge for the security forces
 baavjood iske ab bhi nae yuva hijbul main shaamil ho rahe hai
 a senior official said that this trend needs to be ended at the earliest
 aatankiyon kii bharteeghati main isse pehle aatank kii raah chunane vaale yuvaaon kii bhartee gupachup tareeke se hoti thi
 It used to happen less often that the newly recruited youth were given a big mission
 bhartee ke baad unhen seemaa paar bhej kam se kam 3 maheenon ke liye hathiyaaron kii training di jaati thi or iske baad wo goli-barood lekar waapas lautate or unhen pahchaan chhupaakar kaam par lagaaya ja tha
 Such is the changing trend in the nineties, terrorist activity decreased and after a terrorist encounter there was less response or counter attack
 aisa kam hi hua jab aatankwaadi kii hatya ke baad use shahid kaa darja diya gaya ho
 Burhan was initially working by hiding his identity but later changed the trend and came up with the name openly

 The Supreme Court on Friday suggested that the system of private fair price shops should be abolished for distribution of food grains under the public distribution system and implement the system shown in the National Food Security Bill without waiting for the National Food Security Act to be enacted
 The possibilities of bringing should be explored
 nyaayamurti tirath singh thakur or nyaayamurti fakir em kaliphulla kii khandpeeth ne kaha ki ve saarvajanik vitaran pranali kii prabhaavashiltaa ko lekar chintit hai
 The court said that since the government also agreed with the suggestions of the Justice DP Wadhwa Committee, an administrative system could be made through an executive order regarding the 'broad recommendations' and 'framework' contained in the National Food Security Bill during this period
 
 nyaayadhishon ne kaha ki unka maananaa he ki saarvajanik vitaran pranali main koi ek vyavastha ‘uttam’ vyavastha nahin ho sakati he or vadhwa samiti kii siforeeshon ke anuroop ise rajya str par nigamon, panchayat raaj sansthaaon, sahakaarita or panjikrut mahilaon ke swa-sahaayta samoohon ke jariye inke sanchaalan kaa vikalp khojane ke liye rajya sarkaron par chhod dena chahie
 The court while accepting the report of the Wadhwa Committee on the existing loopholes in the existing system of public distribution system clearly stated that there is a need to change the existing private shops system as there is a lot of rigging and food is not left to the real beneficiaries
 Is reaching nyaayalay ne kaha ki uskaa makasad vartmaan vyavastha or lambit vidheyak ke bich kii duuri kam karnaa he
 The court also noted a suggestion made by Attorney General Ghulam Vahanvati that the provisions of the bill pending in Parliament can be implemented at present by government order
 atarni general ne kaha ki vidheyak ke praavdhaanon par amal karne se khadyann sabsidi kii mad main kendra par kareeb 23 hajaar karod rupye kaa atirikt vittiya boj padegaa lekin sabsidi kii mad main yah raashi bhinn ho sakati he kyonki yah sansad se vidheyak ke manjuuri milane par nirbhar karegaa
 The central government said that the state governments are in favor of setting up a corporation at the state level for the public distribution system
 rajyon par atirikt boj ke tathy ko sweekaar karte huye nyaayalay ne kaha, ‘samoochee saarvajanik vitaran pranali ko durust karne ke liye kargar upayon kii aavashyaktaa he kyonki is vidheyak ke kanoon banane ke bare main anischitata hi he
 The Court asked the Attorney General to explore the possibilities of implementing the main points of the National Food Security Bill in an administrative manner
 nyaayadhishon ne vaahnavati se kaha, ‘kya aap vidheyak main pariklpit binduon par prashasnic or kaaryakari najariye se suzav laa sakate hai
 The future outline is given in the Bill
 yah sarkari vidheyak he
 You are bringing the system through law
 hamaare dwaara nirdesh dene kii bajaaye aap hi prashasnic str par kuch sanrachana uplabdh karaayen
 'the court said that according to this bill you will also have a view
 ham to sirf pranali ke kargar hone ko lekar hi chintit hai
 When the Attorney General said that the aim is to ensure supply of food grains only to the actual beneficiaries, the judges said that through the targeted public distribution system of Tamil Nadu and Jammu and Kashmir government and registered self-help groups of women like Mahila Mandal in Chhattisgarh The food distribution system has been very effective
 vaahnavati ne kaha ki sansadeey samiti ne is vidheyak par apni report de di he or sarkaar ne bhi nirnay liya he
 He hoped that the National Food Security Bill would come in the budget session of Parliament
 nyaayadhishon ne is maamle kii sunwaayee chaar march ke liye sthagit karte huye kaha ki vah is janhit yachika main uthaaye gayi masale kaa samaadhaan karnaa chaahati he kyonki yah 12 saal se nyaayalay main lataka hua he
 The court said that it also wants to give relief to the Wadhwa committee which has been working on this subject for the last six years
 vadhwa samiti kii niyukti sheersh adlaat ne kii thi
 This committee has said in its report that the state governments are not willing to use modern technology of computerization to prevent foodgrains from reaching the public distribution system elsewhere
 samiti kaa maananaa he ki uchit dar dukaanon ke maalikon, naukarshahon or netaaon ke bich is maamle main santhganth hai
 The committee also recommended the government to take over the distribution of the distribution itself, instead of giving subsidized food grains to families living above the poverty line and fair rate shops run by private individuals with the intention of curbing corruption

 In Congress General Secretary, Gandhigrator Noida Kebhatta Parsaulgaon, the Prime Minister met the Prime Minister over a dispute over land acquisition between farmers and the government

 After about half an hour meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Rahul said that the Prime Minister listened carefully to the talk of the eight-member team of farmers
 uttar pradesh kii sthiti par charchaa ke liye rahul ke netritv main is shishtmandal ne pradhanmantri se mulaakaat kii
 Rahul said, 'we are confident that the Land Acquisition Bill will be passed in the next session of Parliament
 ’unhone aarope lagaaya ki gaanvon main chaaron ore jalane ke nishaan maujuud hai jahaan kisaan mayawati sarkaar se apni jameen ke muaavje kii maang kar rahe hai
 Rahul also showed the Prime Minister pictures of alleged burnt bodies and violence against farmers and their family members
 unhone kaha ki gaanv ke logon ke liye yah buniyadi mudda he or uttar pradesh ke gaanvon se badi sankhya main log agra rajmarg par utar aae hai jahaan sarkaar unka daman kar rahi he, logon kii hatyaein kii ja rahi hai

 Asked why the Central Government has not been able to amend the Land Acquisition Act so far, while he made a similar demand to the Prime Minister last year on the same subject, Rahul said that it is taking time because the Bill is complicated
 
 rahul ne kaha, ‘ham bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak ke liye patibaddh hai
 Land acquisition is a complex bill that we are working on
 hamen vishwaas he ki aagaamee satr main yah paas ho jaayegaa
 "he said that amendment is under consideration and" we are committed to this and understand that this is a complex bill
 isliye isamen samay lag rahaa he
 The Congress general secretary said, "I am worried about how we are treating people
" adhikansh logon kisaanon kaa kahana he ki vikaas ke liye jameen dene main unhen khushi hogi
 He says that if the road is constructed, then who will be the problem
 ’ rahul ne kaha, ‘desh ke garib se garib log desh main vikaas chaahate hai or balidaan dene ko taiyaar hai
 The question is how do we treat the poor
 kya ham unke saath acha vyavhaar karte hai
 'he said that Manmohan listened to the farmers with' big attention 'and had a good discussion with them

 saal 1983 ke baad team india ne saal 2011 main vanade cricket itihaas main duusari baar world cap jeeta tha
 Although it is not the case that the team did not get close to becoming the champion before this, but every time she could not do so for some reason
 saal 2011 main bhale hi team ne sachin tendulkar ko world cap kaa tohfa de diya ho, lekin khud sachin ko ek cheez kaa malaal aaj bhi he
 In fact, in the 2003 World Cup, Team India had reached the finals and she was a winning contender, but then something happened that she had to feel discouraged and Sachin's dream of winning the World Cup was also incomplete
 ab sachin tendulkar ne is par baat karte hue kaha he ki agar ek cheez us samay shuru ho jaati, to is match kaa parinaam kuch or hi hota
 
 
 Or even if that match was played in today's round, the result would have been different
 
 
 apni sachin : a billian drims ke prachaar-prasar main vyast sachin tendulkar apane kariyar ke bare main kai baton kaa khulaasa kar rahe hai
 Master-blaster Sachin Tendulkar believes that shorter format cricket has changed almost everything
 unke anusaar tii-20 cricket ke aane se vanade main bade score kaa peechha karne ke maamle main ballebaajon ke ravaiye main badlaav aayaa he or agar 2003 vishwa cap ke dauraan aisa hota to bharat ko madad milti
 In fact, in the 2003 World Cup played on South African soil, the Indian team showed a great game
 vah final main pahunchi thi
 In this title match played in Johannesburg, Australian batsmen beat Indian bowlers like you see in T20 today
 australia ne pehle batting karte hue do wicket par 359 ran banaae the, jiske jawaab main bhartiya team 234 ran par out ho gai thi
 Team India almost conceded defeat while chasing the target and eventually lost by 125 runs
 team ko laga tha ki yah lakshya asambhav he, jabaki tii-20 main 20 over main main hi timen 200 se adhik ke lakshya ko hasil kar leti hai
 
 
 Recalling the old days, Sachin Tendulkar said, 'I think if we played that match today, the players would have played differently
 ’tippaniyan The intention of the master-blaster was that with the arrival of T20, batsmen have found ways to score fast and have adapted themselves accordingly
 unhen is baat kaa malaal he ki unki team ke ballebaaj us samay aisa nahin khel paae the
 He said, 'we were full of excitement in that match and were very excited from the first over
 yadi unheen khilaadiyon ko aaj mauka miltaa to khel ke prati ravaiya doosraa hota
 ' pehle score 300 se paar ho jane par timen lakshya ko asambhav maan leti thim or export bhi haar lagbhag tay bataane lagate the
 He said, 'if T20 cricket was at that time, the attitude of the players would have been different because it was difficult to score 359 runs in those days

 johanisburg main khele gaye is khitaabi match main australian ballebaajon ne bhartiya gendbaajon kii aisi dhunaai kii thi, jaisi ki aaj ke daur main aap tii-20 main dekhte hai
 Australia had scored 359 for two while batting first, in response to which the Indian team was dismissed for 234 runs
 team india ne lakshya kaa peechha karte samay lagbhag pehle hi haar maan lee thi or ant main 125 ran se haar gai thi
 The team felt that this goal was impossible, while in 20 overs in T20, the teams reached the target of more than 200
 
 
 sachin tendulkar ne puraane din yaad karte hue kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki yadi ham vah match aaj khelte to khilaadi alag tareeke se khelte
 Comments master-blaster ke kehane aashay yahi thi ki tii-20 ke aane se ballebaajon ne teji se score karne ke tareeke dhund liye hai or khud ko uske anuroop dhaal liya he
 He is sorry that his team's batsmen did not play at that time
 unhone kaha, ‘ham us match main utsaah se bhare the or pehle hi over se kaaphi utsahit the
 If those same players had a chance today, the attitude towards the game would have been different
 ’ When the first score was over 300, the teams considered the goal impossible and the experts also seemed to give the defeat almost certain
 unhone kaha, ‘tii-20 cricket us samay hota to khilaadiyon kaa ravaiya alag hota kyonki un dinon 359 ran bananaa mushkil lagata tha

 This is the first time in the history of Chardham Yatra when more devotees are arriving in Kedarnath Dham than in Badrinath
 is baar kedarnath dham ke kapaat 29 april or badrinaath dham ke kapaat 30 april ko khole gaye the
 The number of travelers reaching Badrinath was always more than those arriving from Kedarnath
 lekin is baar alag hi trend dekhne ko mil rahe hai
 While about 12 thousand passengers are arriving daily in Kedarnath, the number of passengers reaching Badrinath is between 11 thousand and 12 thousand

 The chopper service running for here has also increased the number of passengers

 The trend of Kedarnath Yatra has also changed after the June 2013 disaster

 Even after the opposition's shutdown in India, the rupee did not stop falling and the price of petrol diesel did not stop

 Why is the dollar going strong? kaaran yah he ki kai deshon kii arthvyavastha ladkadaa rahi he
 That's why investors are withdrawing their money and buying dollars
 is kaaran dollar mahangaa hota ja rahaa he kyonki sab kharid rahe hai

 Just as today people are viraling the link of statements of Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Shahnawaz Hussain before 2014, in the same way after 2069, i will share the link of prime time as Amit Shah has said that in 2019 After winning, nobody will be able to defeat BJP for 50 years
 bijepi netaa or kendiy mantri ravishankar prasad ne band ko loktantric adhikaar bataate hue kaha ki jo hinsa hui he uske liye koun zimmedaar he
 He said that the people of Congress and Opposition are creating fear in anger
 in sab baton kii aalochana karte hue ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki petrol deazal kaa daam badhanaa hamaare haath ke baahar he
 So you heard
 dijal or petrol kaa badhanaa hamaare haath ke baahar he
 Would this not have been the international cause during the Bharat Bandh of BJP? phir tab vipaksh ne bharat band kyon kiya
 Then why did Ravi Shankar Prasad ride a bicycle taking part in the bandh
 ek video main ravishankar prasad cycle chalaate hue petrol deazal ke daam kaa virodh karte dikhte hai
 Even at that time there were international reasons
 kachche tel kaa daam 109 dollars prati bairal tak ho gaya tha
 Then Arun Jaitley had said that petrol should be 50 rupees a liter at $ 90 per barrel
 is vakt 78 dollar prati bairal he, jetali ji 50 rupee litre petrol kyon nahin kar dete hai
 Talking to our affiliate channel on 23 May 2012, Ravi Shankar Prasad was rejecting the logic of international causes based on what information
 tab hamaari sahyogi ankar ne prasad se poocha tha ki aap satta main hote to kya karte to unhone kaha tha ham jab satta main aaengo to arthvyavastha ko is tarah se manage karenge ki aise jatke ko bardaasht kar le
 Now the question is from them that what you have managed is that the shock is unable to be tolerated and petrol has been reduced to 89 rupees a liter
 ye to upie ke samay bhi nahin hua tha
 In this reply, Ravi Shankar Prasad is also saying that he understands the rise in the price of crude oil, but even when the price of crude oil is low, the government does not reduce the price of petrol diesel
 2014 main modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad to international market main kachche tel kii keemat girte girte 2016 tak kareeb 41 dollars prati bairal ho gai thi
 Did the prices come down in the ratio in which the price of crude oil decreased
 2012 main kachche tel kii ausat keemat 109 dollar prati bairal tak pahunch gai
 Then petrol 73 in May 2012 in Delhi
 18 rupee litre pahunch gaya tha
 In 2017, when the average price of crude oil was 52
 51 dollar prati bairal ho gai
 Then in Delhi on 3rd Sibantar 2017 69 was 55 paise per liter
 aap dekh sakenge ki endieke samay kachche tel kii keemat kareeb 51 dollar prati bairal hone par bhi petrol 69 rupee litre mila or upie ke samay 2012 main 107 dollar prati bairal hone par kareeb 69 rupee prati litre aapane diya
 This is a game

 71 paisa was liter, which was 40 rupees 62 paise on 16 May 2009

 8 pratishat bad gaya
 Now on September 10, 2018, 80 rupees 73 paise per liter, which has been reduced by 13 percent

 According to this chart, in August 2009 and September 2018, both the time the price of crude oil 71
 9 dollars prati bairal thi
 In comparison, on 10 August 2009, petrol in the UPA government was 44 rupees 63 paise
 modi sarkaar main 10 sitambar 2018 ko 80 rupee 73 paise prati litre ho gaya he

 kya kamai badi
 Anandya Chakraborty has told in his simple news that 8 of GDP

 You can see the simple news of the actors on the website of NDTV
 unka kahana he ki aamadani se mudrasphiti ko edjust kar dene par kisaanon kii asli aamadani na dekhne laayak he na dikhaane laayak he
 Between april-june 2017 to april-june 2018, income per farmer increased from Rs 100 to 101
 60 paise badi he
 That is, 1 rupee 60 paise
 yahi raftaar rahi to 100 se 200 hone main 44 saal lagenge
 Farmers' income will double by then
 tippaniyan It is good that till then BJP will remain the government because BJP President Amit Shah has said that BJP will remain in government for 50 years i

 ho saktaa he ki petrol deazal mahangaa hone or naukariyaan nahin milane ke baad bhi bhaajapa ko janata kaa apaar samarthan miltaa rahe lekin isaki vajah se janata ko takalif nahin he yah baat bhi sahi nahin
 Today, Rahul Singh of Hindustan Times reports that the Indian Army is going to reduce one and a half lakh jobs in the next 4-5 years

 This information should be reached in time to the youths who run day and night to join the army in the village countryside

 Rajasthan has reduced tax by 2 rupees 21 paise, yet petrol is 81 rupees 21 paise
 dijal 75 rupee 12 paise litre he
 During the Bharat Bandh in 2012, Arun Jaitley made an accurate prediction while in opposition
 yahi ki agar sarkaron ne tex ko sahi nahin kiya to is tarah ke pradarshan hote rahenge
 The public is happy in the politics of petrol and diesel
 ab uske paas dosha dene ke liye koi nahin bachaa he
 Now she will not be able to blame anyone for 50 years because Amit Shah has said that the BJP will remain in power for 50 years on the strength of its work
 kya us kaam main petrol or deazal ke daam kam karne kaa bhi kaam shaamil he
 It is a question or it is not a question at all
 aaj bazaar band hone par ek dollar 72 rupee 67 paise kaa ho gaya
 On September 6, 71 rupees was 11 paise
 bharat ke itihaas main kabhi rupaya itnaa nahin gira
 Bhavik Patel of tradebulls Securities in Financial Express has said that this week one dollar will be 73 rupees 50 paise
 yani or giregaa
 Peter Brandt has said that the bad phase of the rupee has not yet arrived
 isse bhi bura daur aa saktaa he
 If the rupee crosses 71 then it will go to 80 in four to six weeks
 14 agast ke iconomik times main peter brandt kaa yah bayaan chapa tha
 Peter is described as a chartist who talks through the graphics chart of the record of falling stock or currency
 ila patnayak ne likhaa he ki bhartiya reserve bank ko rupee kii giravat rokane kaa prayaas nahin karnaa chahie
 In 2013, the RBI increased the supply of dollars, but it did not strengthen the rupee
 is vakt bhartiya reserve bank ke paas 400 arab dollar hai
 If he wants, he can increase the supply of the dollar, but it will not yield any result, so the government should not be disturbed and should not get in the way of falling of the rupee
 ila patnayak kaa yah lekh bloomberg website par chapa he
 Why is the dollar going strong? kaaran yah he ki kai deshon kii arthvyavastha ladkadaa rahi he
 That's why investors are withdrawing their money and buying dollars
 is kaaran dollar mahangaa hota ja rahaa he kyonki sab kharid rahe hai
 Indian oil companies are also buying dollars in anticipation of rising crude oil prices
 pitiai ke hawaale se khabar chhapi he ki abhi kaa dollar tab tel kareedne ke kaam aayega
 International circumstances are being talked about
 hamane kai website se kuch jaankaree aapke liye jamaa kii he
 There are many countries whose economy is collapsing, one of them is Turkey where the strong leader's passion was overshadowed

 Now they are saying that enemy countries are attacking Turkey's economy

 bharat kaa rupaya bhi inhen sab kaarnon kii chapet main hoga lekin 2014 ke pehle kii raajnneeti ne un kaarnon ko riject kar diya tha ab jab sawaal poocha ja rahaa he to kaha ja rahaa he ki antarrashtriya paristhitiyaan zimmedaar hai
 If the rupee goes up to 80, what will be the condition of importers, where will the price of petrol diesel go, how much economic burden will increase on students studying abroad, all the questions are in front
 bharat band petrol deazal ke daam badhane ke khilaaf tha magar in donon ne bhi bharat band kaa virodh kiya he or apana daam un baabaaon ko yaad karte hue badha liya jo kabhi petrol ko 35 rupee par bikwane vaale the

 Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena have also participated in this bandh
 amit shah ne bhaajapa kii rashtriya kaaryakarini main kaha he ki 2019 main aane ke baad agle 50 saal tak bhaajapa ko koi nahin haraa sakegaa
 He also made it clear that he is not doing this in ego, but because of his work no one will be able to defeat BJP
 is lihaaz se 2069 tak bhaajapa kii hi sarkaar rahegi
 The story of Bharat Bandh has faded ahead of this humble prediction of Amit Shah

e
 75
 8 pratishat bad gaya
 Now on September 10, 2018, 80 rupees 73 paise per liter, which has been reduced by 13 percent
 kya vaaki daam ghate hai
 In response to this, Congress has tweeted
 congress ne kachche tel ke daam ke anusaar bataaya he
 According to this chart, in August 2009 and September 2018, both the time the price of crude oil 71
 9 dollars prati bairal thi
 In comparison, on 10 August 2009, petrol in the UPA government was 44 rupees 63 paise
 modi sarkaar main 10 sitambar 2018 ko 80 rupee 73 paise prati litre ho gaya he
 Price increase that decreased
 janata congress bijepi kaa iz iklaval tu game dekh rahi he
 bjp's graphics have reduced prices while your pocket has increased
 kya kamai badi
 Anandya Chakraborty has told in his simple news that 8 of GDP
 2 pratishat hone ke baad bhi logon kii asli aamadani main kaaphi giravat ai he
 You can see the simple news of the actors on the website of NDTV
 unka kahana he ki aamadani se mudrasphiti ko edjust kar dene par kisaanon kii asli aamadani na dekhne laayak he na dikhaane laayak he
 Between april-june 2017 to april-june 2018, income per farmer increased from Rs 100 to 101
 60 paise badi he
 That is, 1 rupee 60 paise
 yahi raftaar rahi to 100 se 200 hone main 44 saal lagenge
 Farmers' income will double by then
 tippaniyan It is good that till then BJP will remain the government because BJP President Amit Shah has said that BJP will remain in government for 50 years i
e
 till 2069
 ho saktaa he ki petrol deazal mahangaa hone or naukariyaan nahin milane ke baad bhi bhaajapa ko janata kaa apaar samarthan miltaa rahe lekin isaki vajah se janata ko takalif nahin he yah baat bhi sahi nahin
 Today, Rahul Singh of Hindustan Times reports that the Indian Army is going to reduce one and a half lakh jobs in the next 4-5 years
 iske liye june ke maheene main kader kii kshamta kii samiksha karne ke aadesh die gaye hai
 a panel of 11 members has been formed which will also consider reducing the number force
 baaki report aap hindustan times main padhein
 This information should be reached in time to the youths who run day and night to join the army in the village countryside
 andhra pradesh or rajasthan ne tex main kami kii he magar daam par koi khaas asar nahin he
 Rajasthan has reduced tax by 2 rupees 21 paise, yet petrol is 81 rupees 21 paise
 dijal 75 rupee 12 paise litre he
 During the Bharat Bandh in 2012, Arun Jaitley made an accurate prediction while in opposition
 yahi ki agar sarkaron ne tex ko sahi nahin kiya to is tarah ke pradarshan hote rahenge
 The public is happy in the politics of petrol and diesel
 ab uske paas dosha dene ke liye koi nahin bachaa he
 Now she will not be able to blame anyone for 50 years because Amit Shah has said that the BJP will remain in power for 50 years on the strength of its work
 kya us kaam main petrol or deazal ke daam kam karne kaa bhi kaam shaamil he
 It is a question or it is not a question at all
 kaaran yah he ki kai deshon kii arthvyavastha ladkadaa rahi he
 That's why investors are withdrawing their money and buying dollars
 is kaaran dollar mahangaa hota ja rahaa he kyonki sab kharid rahe hai
 Indian oil companies are also buying dollars in anticipation of rising crude oil prices
 pitiai ke hawaale se khabar chhapi he ki abhi kaa dollar tab tel kareedne ke kaam aayega
 International circumstances are being talked about
 hamane kai website se kuch jaankaree aapke liye jamaa kii he
 There are many countries whose economy is collapsing, one of them is Turkey where the strong leader's passion was overshadowed
 raashtrapati erdogen ke chunaav jeetne ke baad bhi turki sanbhal nahin paa rahaa he
 Now they are saying that enemy countries are attacking Turkey's economy
 jaldi hi bharat main bhi whatsap uniwarsity se aisa hi kaha jane vaala he
 The turkey lira has broken 50 percent against the dollar in a year
 yahaan se niveshak bhaag rahe hai or dollar kareedne lage hai
 Trump has imposed a heavy tax on steel exports to Turkey
 indonesia kaa rupaya bhi 20 saal ke nunatam str par pahunch gaya he
 There has been a state of economic emergency in Argentina
 argentina kaa karency peso bhi dollar ke saamne natmastak ho gaya he
 The interest rate for handling budget deficit has been increased to 60 percent
 bharat kaa rupaya bhi inhen sab kaarnon kii chapet main hoga lekin 2014 ke pehle kii raajnneeti ne un kaarnon ko riject kar diya tha ab jab sawaal poocha ja rahaa he to kaha ja rahaa he ki antarrashtriya paristhitiyaan zimmedaar hai
 If the rupee goes up to 80, what will be the condition of importers, where will the price of petrol diesel go, how much economic burden will increase on students studying abroad, all the questions are in front
 bharat band petrol deazal ke daam badhane ke khilaaf tha magar in donon ne bhi bharat band kaa virodh kiya he or apana daam un baabaaon ko yaad karte hue badha liya jo kabhi petrol ko 35 rupee par bikwane vaale the
 89 at Parbhani, Maharashtra
 97 rupaya litre ho gaya he
 There is 88 rupees 12 paise petrol in Saharsa district of Bihar
 mumbai vaale 88 rupee 12 paise litre petrol kareed rahe hai
 Petrol has now become 80 rupees 73 paise in Delhi
 10 sitambar ko vipaksh kaa bharat band tha
 The Prime Minister's statement was printed in the morning newspapers that the Congress had failed in the government as well as in the opposition
 congress kaa band tha ki modi sarkaar fail he lekin unke netaaon ne jab akhbaar haath main uthaaya hoga to yahi padhaa hoga ki vahi fail hai
 In this politics of failure versus failure, keep an eye on your vehicle tank
 congress ke bharat band ko 20 se zyada vipakshi dalon kaa saath mila he
 Rahul Gandhi went to Rajghat with different party leaders
 maansarovar se jo jal laae the use baapu kii samadhi par chadhaaya or phir vipakshi dalon ke saath march karte hue rajghat se ramlila maidan pahunche
 They traveled for up to three kilometer
 is march main ensipi, jedes, argedy, areldi, sapa, basapa, tiemasi or aam aadmi party ke netaaon ne hissaa liya or ramlila maidan ke manch par saath nazar aae
 Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena have also participated in this bandh
 amit shah ne bhaajapa kii rashtriya kaaryakarini main kaha he ki 2019 main aane ke baad agle 50 saal tak bhaajapa ko koi nahin haraa sakegaa
 He also made it clear that he is not doing this in ego, but because of his work no one will be able to defeat BJP
 is lihaaz se 2069 tak bhaajapa kii hi sarkaar rahegi
 The story of Bharat Bandh has faded ahead of this humble prediction of Amit Shah
 phir bhi aap note karen ki elahabaad main congressi kaaryakarta do gadhon ko majaboor kar rahe hai ki wo car khinchen
 What was the fault of these donkeys in increasing the price of petrol? gadhon ne mujhe exclusive baatcheet main kaha he ki unhen nahin pataa ki petrol mahangaa ho gaya he kyonki jab sasta hota he tab bhi insaan unki peeth par boj kam nahin karata he
 These Congress workers are playing a bean by climbing a buffalo

 Muretha was riding a rickshaw
 haath jod kar abhivadan kar rahe the
 Scooty was running on the handcart behind the rickshaw and a gas cylinder was running behind Scooty
 hamane friday flashbek main dikhaaya tha ki kaise bharat band ke vakt bijepi ne tarah tarah kaa idia nikaala tha taaki news channelon or akhabaaron main un tasveeron ko jagah mili or vipaksh ke band kii khabar pehle panne par pramukhataa se aa sake
 You will see the newspaper of September 11
 desh ke kai hisson main vipaksh ke kaaryakartao ne jhande binakar ke saath march kiya
 Somewhere the market is closed and somewhere the highway gets jammed
 hamane yah sab apni librari ke archive main rakhane ke liye dikhaaya he
 Just as today people are viraling the link of statements of Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Shahnawaz Hussain before 2014, in the same way after 2069, i will share the link of prime time as Amit Shah has said that in 2019 After winning, nobody will be able to defeat BJP for 50 years
 bijepi netaa or kendiy mantri ravishankar prasad ne band ko loktantric adhikaar bataate hue kaha ki jo hinsa hui he uske liye koun zimmedaar he
 He said that the people of Congress and Opposition are creating fear in anger
 in sab baton kii aalochana karte hue ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki petrol deazal kaa daam badhanaa hamaare haath ke baahar he
 So you heard
 dijal or petrol kaa badhanaa hamaare haath ke baahar he
 Would this not have been the international cause during the Bharat Bandh of BJP? phir tab vipaksh ne bharat band kyon kiya
 Then why did Ravi Shankar Prasad ride a bicycle taking part in the bandh
 ek video main ravishankar prasad cycle chalaate hue petrol deazal ke daam kaa virodh karte dikhte hai
 Even at that time there were international reasons
 kachche tel kaa daam 109 dollars prati bairal tak ho gaya tha
 Then Arun Jaitley had said that petrol should be 50 rupees a liter at $ 90 per barrel
 is vakt 78 dollar prati bairal he, jetali ji 50 rupee litre petrol kyon nahin kar dete hai
 Talking to our affiliate channel on 23 May 2012, Ravi Shankar Prasad was rejecting the logic of international causes based on what information
 tab hamaari sahyogi ankar ne prasad se poocha tha ki aap satta main hote to kya karte to unhone kaha tha ham jab satta main aaengo to arthvyavastha ko is tarah se manage karenge ki aise jatke ko bardaasht kar le
 Now the question is from them that what you have managed is that the shock is unable to be tolerated and petrol has been reduced to 89 rupees a liter
 ye to upie ke samay bhi nahin hua tha
 In this reply, Ravi Shankar Prasad is also saying that he understands the rise in the price of crude oil, but even when the price of crude oil is low, the government does not reduce the price of petrol diesel
 2014 main modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad to international market main kachche tel kii keemat girte girte 2016 tak kareeb 41 dollars prati bairal ho gai thi
 Did the prices come down in the ratio in which the price of crude oil decreased
 2012 main kachche tel kii ausat keemat 109 dollar prati bairal tak pahunch gai
 Then petrol 73 in May 2012 in Delhi
 18 rupee litre pahunch gaya tha
 In 2017, when the average price of crude oil was 52
 51 dollar prati bairal ho gai
 Then in Delhi on 3rd Sibantar 2017 69 was 55 paise per liter
 aap dekh sakenge ki endieke samay kachche tel kii keemat kareeb 51 dollar prati bairal hone par bhi petrol 69 rupee litre mila or upie ke samay 2012 main 107 dollar prati bairal hone par kareeb 69 rupee prati litre aapane diya
 This is a game
 aaj congress or bijepi ke bich twitor par graphics ke zarie bhi jang hui
 The BJP has not stated the ratio of crude oil prices in its graphics
 bijepi ke graphics chart ke anusaar 16 may 2004 ko petrol 33
 71 paisa was liter, which was 40 rupees 62 paise on 16 May 2009
 yani paanch saal main 20 pratishat zyada badha

 Today, Rahul Singh of Hindustan Times reports that the Indian Army is going to reduce one and a half lakh jobs in the next 4-5 years

 kya us kaam main petrol or deazal ke daam kam karne kaa bhi kaam shaamil he
 It is a question or it is not a question at all
 antarrashtriya paristhitiyon kii baat kii ja rahi he
 We have collected some information for you from many websites
 kai aise mulk hai jinaki arthvyavastha charmara rahi he unamem se ek to turki he jahaan majboot netaa kaa junun chaaya hua tha
 Turkey has not been able to recover even after President Erdogan won the election
 ab ve kah rahe hai ki dushman desh turki kii arthvyavastha par hamalaa kar rahe hai
 Soon, the same is to be said from whatsapp University in India too

 Argentina's currency peso has also fallen in front of the dollar
 bajet ghate ko sanbhaalane ke liye byaaz dar 60 pratishat ho gaya he
 India's rupee will also be in the grip of all these reasons, but the politics before 2014 rejected those reasons
 Now when the question is being asked, it is being said that international conditions are responsible
 agar rupaya 80 tak chalaa gaya to aayaat karne waalon kii kya haalat hogi, petrol deazal ke daam kahaan tak jaaenge, videshon main padhane vaale chaatro par kitna aarthik boj badhegaa, yah sab sawaal saamne hai
 The Bharat Bandh was against the increase in the price of petrol diesel, but both of them have also opposed the Bharat Bandh and raised their prices by remembering the babas who were once selling petrol for Rs
 35
 maharashtra ke parabhani main 89
 97 rupees to the liter
 bihar ke saharsa zile main 88 rupee 12 paise petrol he
 The Mumbai people are buying 88 rupees 12 paise a liter of petrol
 dilli main ab petrol 80 rupee 73 paise kaa ho gaya he
 On 10 September, the opposition India was closed
 subah ke akhbaaron main pradhanmantri kaa bayaan chapa tha ki congress sarkaar main bhi fail thi, vipaksh main bhi fail he
 The Congress was closed that the Modi government had failed, but when their leaders raised the newspaper in their hands, they must have read that they failed
 fail banaam fail kii is raajnneeti main aap apni gaadi kii tank par nazar rakhie
 The Bharat Bandh of Congress has been supported by more than 20 opposition parties
 rahul gandhi alag-alag dal ke netaaon ke saath rajghat gaye
 Bapu brought the water he had brought from Mansarovar to the tomb and then marched with the opposition parties to the Ramlila Maidan from Rajghat
 teen kilo meter tak sabane padayatra kii
 This March, NCP, ZS, RJD, RLD, SP, BSP, TMC and Aam Aadmi Party leaders took part and appeared on the stage of Ramlila Maidan
 shivasena or maharashtra navnirmaan sena ne bhi is band main hissaa liya he
 Amit Shah has said in bjp's national executive that after coming in 2019, no one will be able to beat BJP for next 50 years
 unhone yah bhi saaf kiya ki ve yah baat ahankaar main nahin kar rahe balki apane kaam kii vajah se bhaajapa ko koi nahin haraa paaegaa
 In this sense, till 2069, BJP will remain the government
 amit shah kii is vinamr bhavishyavaanee ke aage bharat band kii kahani feeki ho gai he
 However, you should note that the Congress workers in Allahabad are forcing two donkeys to pull the car
 petrol ke daam badhane main in gadhon kaa kya kasoor tha
 The donkeys have told me in an exclusive conversation that they do not know that petrol has become expensive because even when cheaper, humans do not reduce the burden on their back
 bhens par chadhakar yah congressi kaaryakarta been baja rahe hai
 Normally there is a phrase of playing the bean in front of the buffalo, but here, sitting on the buffalo, playing the bean

 He was greeting with folded hands
 rickshaw ke peeche thele par skuti chali aa rahi thi or skuti ke peeche gas kaa silendar chalaa aa rahaa tha
 We showed in the Friday flashback how the BJP had come out with a variety of ideas during the Bharat Bandh so that those pictures could be found in the news channels and newspapers and the news of the opposition's shutdown could come prominently on the front page
 aap 11 sitambar kaa akhbaar dekh lijiega
 In many parts of the country, activists of the opposition marched with the flag banners
 kahin bazaar band rahe to kahin haive par jam ho gaya
 We have shown all this to be kept in the archive of our library
 jis tarah se aaj log 2014 ke pehle ke arun jetali, sushamaa swaraj, ravishankar prasad, shahanwaaz hossain ke bayanon kaa link viral kar rahe hai, usee tarah 2069 ke baad mere prime time kaa link share karenge kyonki amit shah ne kaha he ki 2019 main jeetne ke baad bhaajapa ko 50 saal tak koi nahin haraa sakegaa
 BJP leader and Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad termed the bandh as a democratic right and said who is responsible for the violence that has taken place
 unhone kaha ki congress or vipaksh ke log gusse main khoff paidaa kar rahe hai
 Criticizing all these things, Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the increase in the price of petrol diesel is out of our hands
 to aapane suna
 The increase of diesel and petrol is out of our hands
 kya yahi antarrashtriya kaaran bijepi ke bharat band ke samay nahin rahe honge
 Then why did the opposition stop India
 tab kyon ravishankar prasad ne band main hissaa lete hue cycle chalaai thi
 In one video, Ravi Shankar Prasad is seen cycling against the price of petrol diesel
 us samay bhi to antarrashtriya kaaran the
 The price of crude oil went up to USD 109 per barrel
 tab arun jetali ne kaha tha ki 90 dollar prati bairal hone par petrol 50 rupee litre hona chahie
 At the moment it is $ 78 per barrel, why don't Jaitley g 50 rupees a liter of petrol
 23 may 2012 ko hamaare sahyogi channel se baat karte hue ravishankar prasad kis jaankaree ke aadhaar par antarrashtriya kaarnon ke tark ko riject kar rahe the
 Then our colleague Anchor had asked Prasad what he would have done if he was in power and he had said that when we come to power, we will manage the economy in such a way that it can tolerate such a setback
 ab sawaal unheen se he ki aapane kya manage kiya he ki jhatka bardaasht nahin ho paa rahaa he or petrol 89 rupaya litre ho gaya
 This did not happen even during the UPA
 is jawaab main ravishankar prasad yah bhi kah rahe hai ki ve kachche tel ke daam badhane kii baat samajhate hai lekin jab kachche tel kii keemat kam hoti he tab bhi sarkaar petrol deazal ke daam kam nahin karti he
 After the arrival of the Modi government in 2014, the price of crude oil in the international market had fallen to around $ 41 per barrel by 2016
 kya us anupaat main daam kam hue the jis anupaat main kachche tel kii keemat ghati thi
 In 2012, the average price of crude oil reached $ 109 per barrel
 tab dilli main may 2012 main petrol 73
 18 liters was reached
 2017 main jab kachche tel kii ausat keemat 52
 $ 51 per barrel
 tab dilli main 3 sibantar 2017 ko 69 rupee 55 paise prati litre tha
 You can see that petrol got 69 rupees liter even when the price of crude oil was around $ 51 per barrel at the time of NDAK and you gave about 69 rupees per liter when UPA was $ 107 per barrel in 2012
 yah khel he
 Today, there was a war between the Congress and the BJP through graphics on Twitter
 bijepi ne apane graphics main kachche tel kii keemton kaa anupaat nahin bataaya he
 Petrol 33 on 16 May 2004 as per the bjp's graphics chart
 71 paise litre tha jo 16 may 2009 ko 40 rupee 62 paise hua
 That is, it increased by 20 percent in five years
 phir 16 may 2014 ko 71 rupee 41 paise prati litre hua yani 75
 Rose 8 percent
 ab 10 sitambar 2018 ko 80 rupee 73 paise prati litre hua he jo 13 pratishat gata he
 Are the prices really down? iske jawaab main congress kaa twit he
 The Congress has said according to the price of crude oil
 is chart ke anusaar agast 2009 or sitambar 2018 main donon time kachche tel kii keemat 71
 9 dollars per barrel
 uske mukaable main 10 agast 2009 ko upie kii sarkaar main petrol 44 rupee 63 paise litre tha
 In the Modi government, on 10 September 2018, 80 rupees has been 73 paise per liter
 daam badha ki gata

 He says that the real income of farmers is not worth seeing or showing after adjusting the inflation from income
 april-june 2017 se april-june 2018 ke bich prati kisaan aamadani 100 rupee se badhkar 101
 60 paise has been increased
 yani 1 rupee 60 paise
 If this pace is there then it will take 44 years to become 100 to 200
 kisaanon kii aamadani tab jaakar doguni hogi
 The comments acchhee baat he ki tab tak bhaajapa kii hi sarkaar rahegi kyonki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha he ki bhaajapa kii 50 saal tak yani 2069 tak sarkaar rahegi
 It may be that the BJP continues to get immense support from the public even after petrol diesel becomes expensive and jobs are not available, but because of this the public does not have any problem

 is march main ensipi, jedes, argedy, areldi, sapa, basapa, tiemasi or aam aadmi party ke netaaon ne hissaa liya or ramlila maidan ke manch par saath nazar aae
 Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena have also participated in this bandh
 amit shah ne bhaajapa kii rashtriya kaaryakarini main kaha he ki 2019 main aane ke baad agle 50 saal tak bhaajapa ko koi nahin haraa sakegaa
 He also made it clear that he is not doing this in ego, but because of his work no one will be able to defeat BJP
 is lihaaz se 2069 tak bhaajapa kii hi sarkaar rahegi
 The story of Bharat Bandh has faded ahead of this humble prediction of Amit Shah
 phir bhi aap note karen ki elahabaad main congressi kaaryakarta do gadhon ko majaboor kar rahe hai ki wo car khinchen
 What was the fault of these donkeys in increasing the price of petrol? gadhon ne mujhe exclusive baatcheet main kaha he ki unhen nahin pataa ki petrol mahangaa ho gaya he kyonki jab sasta hota he tab bhi insaan unki peeth par boj kam nahin karata he

 hamane friday flashbek main dikhaaya tha ki kaise bharat band ke vakt bijepi ne tarah tarah kaa idia nikaala tha taaki news channelon or akhabaaron main un tasveeron ko jagah mili or vipaksh ke band kii khabar pehle panne par pramukhataa se aa sake
 You will see the newspaper of September 11
 desh ke kai hisson main vipaksh ke kaaryakartao ne jhande binakar ke saath march kiya
 Somewhere the market is closed and somewhere the highway gets jammed
 hamane yah sab apni librari ke archive main rakhane ke liye dikhaaya he
 Just as today people are viraling the link of statements of Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Shahnawaz Hussain before 2014, in the same way after 2069, i will share the link of prime time as Amit Shah has said that in 2019 After winning, nobody will be able to defeat BJP for 50 years
 bijepi netaa or kendiy mantri ravishankar prasad ne band ko loktantric adhikaar bataate hue kaha ki jo hinsa hui he uske liye koun zimmedaar he
 He said that the people of Congress and Opposition are creating fear in anger
 in sab baton kii aalochana karte hue ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki petrol deazal kaa daam badhanaa hamaare haath ke baahar he
 So you heard
 dijal or petrol kaa badhanaa hamaare haath ke baahar he
 Would this not have been the international cause during the Bharat Bandh of BJP? phir tab vipaksh ne bharat band kyon kiya
 Then why did Ravi Shankar Prasad ride a bicycle taking part in the bandh
 ek video main ravishankar prasad cycle chalaate hue petrol deazal ke daam kaa virodh karte dikhte hai
 Even at that time there were international reasons
 kachche tel kaa daam 109 dollars prati bairal tak ho gaya tha
 Then Arun Jaitley had said that petrol should be 50 rupees a liter at $ 90 per barrel
 is vakt 78 dollar prati bairal he, jetali ji 50 rupee litre petrol kyon nahin kar dete hai
 Talking to our affiliate channel on 23 May 2012, Ravi Shankar Prasad was rejecting the logic of international causes based on what information
 tab hamaari sahyogi ankar ne prasad se poocha tha ki aap satta main hote to kya karte to unhone kaha tha ham jab satta main aaengo to arthvyavastha ko is tarah se manage karenge ki aise jatke ko bardaasht kar le
 Now the question is from them that what you have managed is that the shock is unable to be tolerated and petrol has been reduced to 89 rupees a liter
 ye to upie ke samay bhi nahin hua tha
 In this reply, Ravi Shankar Prasad is also saying that he understands the rise in the price of crude oil, but even when the price of crude oil is low, the government does not reduce the price of petrol diesel
 2014 main modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad to international market main kachche tel kii keemat girte girte 2016 tak kareeb 41 dollars prati bairal ho gai thi
 Did the prices come down in the ratio in which the price of crude oil decreased
 2012 main kachche tel kii ausat keemat 109 dollar prati bairal tak pahunch gai
 Then petrol 73 in May 2012 in Delhi
 18 rupee litre pahunch gaya tha
 In 2017, when the average price of crude oil was 52
 51 dollar prati bairal ho gai
 Then in Delhi on 3rd Sibantar 2017 69 was 55 paise per liter
 aap dekh sakenge ki endieke samay kachche tel kii keemat kareeb 51 dollar prati bairal hone par bhi petrol 69 rupee litre mila or upie ke samay 2012 main 107 dollar prati bairal hone par kareeb 69 rupee prati litre aapane diya
 This is a game
 aaj congress or bijepi ke bich twitor par graphics ke zarie bhi jang hui
 The BJP has not stated the ratio of crude oil prices in its graphics
 bijepi ke graphics chart ke anusaar 16 may 2004 ko petrol 33
 71 paisa was liter, which was 40 rupees 62 paise on 16 May 2009
 yani paanch saal main 20 pratishat zyada badha
 Then on May 16, 2014, 71 rupees 41 paise per liter i
e
 75
 8 pratishat bad gaya
 Now on September 10, 2018, 80 rupees 73 paise per liter, which has been reduced by 13 percent
 kya vaaki daam ghate hai
 In response to this, Congress has tweeted
 congress ne kachche tel ke daam ke anusaar bataaya he
 According to this chart, in August 2009 and September 2018, both the time the price of crude oil 71
 9 dollars prati bairal thi
 In comparison, on 10 August 2009, petrol in the UPA government was 44 rupees 63 paise
 modi sarkaar main 10 sitambar 2018 ko 80 rupee 73 paise prati litre ho gaya he
 Price increase that decreased
 janata congress bijepi kaa iz iklaval tu game dekh rahi he
 bjp's graphics have reduced prices while your pocket has increased
 kya kamai badi
 Anandya Chakraborty has told in his simple news that 8 of GDP
 2 pratishat hone ke baad bhi logon kii asli aamadani main kaaphi giravat ai he
 You can see the simple news of the actors on the website of NDTV
 unka kahana he ki aamadani se mudrasphiti ko edjust kar dene par kisaanon kii asli aamadani na dekhne laayak he na dikhaane laayak he
 Between april-june 2017 to april-june 2018, income per farmer increased from Rs 100 to 101
 60 paise badi he
 That is, 1 rupee 60 paise
 yahi raftaar rahi to 100 se 200 hone main 44 saal lagenge
 Farmers' income will double by then
 tippaniyan It is good that till then BJP will remain the government because BJP President Amit Shah has said that BJP will remain in government for 50 years i

 till 2069
 ho saktaa he ki petrol deazal mahangaa hone or naukariyaan nahin milane ke baad bhi bhaajapa ko janata kaa apaar samarthan miltaa rahe lekin isaki vajah se janata ko takalif nahin he yah baat bhi sahi nahin
 Today, Rahul Singh of Hindustan Times reports that the Indian Army is going to reduce one and a half lakh jobs in the next 4-5 years

 During the Bharat Bandh in 2012, Arun Jaitley made an accurate prediction while in opposition
 yahi ki agar sarkaron ne tex ko sahi nahin kiya to is tarah ke pradarshan hote rahenge
 The public is happy in the politics of petrol and diesel
 ab uske paas dosha dene ke liye koi nahin bachaa he
 Now she will not be able to blame anyone for 50 years because Amit Shah has said that the BJP will remain in power for 50 years on the strength of its work
 kya us kaam main petrol or deazal ke daam kam karne kaa bhi kaam shaamil he
 It is a question or it is not a question at all
 bharat kaa rupaya bhi inhen sab kaarnon kii chapet main hoga lekin 2014 ke pehle kii raajnneeti ne un kaarnon ko riject kar diya tha ab jab sawaal poocha ja rahaa he to kaha ja rahaa he ki antarrashtriya paristhitiyaan zimmedaar hai
 If the rupee goes up to 80, what will be the condition of importers, where will the price of petrol diesel go, how much economic burden will increase on students studying abroad, all the questions are in front
 bharat band petrol deazal ke daam badhane ke khilaaf tha magar in donon ne bhi bharat band kaa virodh kiya he or apana daam un baabaaon ko yaad karte hue badha liya jo kabhi petrol ko 35 rupee par bikwane vaale the

 There is 88 rupees 12 paise petrol in Saharsa district of Bihar

 In this politics of failure versus failure, keep an eye on your vehicle tank

 97 rupees to the liter
 bihar ke saharsa zile main 88 rupee 12 paise petrol he
 The Mumbai people are buying 88 rupees 12 paise a liter of petrol
 dilli main ab petrol 80 rupee 73 paise kaa ho gaya he
 On 10 September, the opposition India was closed
 subah ke akhbaaron main pradhanmantri kaa bayaan chapa tha ki congress sarkaar main bhi fail thi, vipaksh main bhi fail he
 The Congress was closed that the Modi government had failed, but when their leaders raised the newspaper in their hands, they must have read that they failed
 fail banaam fail kii is raajnneeti main aap apni gaadi kii tank par nazar rakhie
 The Bharat Bandh of Congress has been supported by more than 20 opposition parties
 rahul gandhi alag-alag dal ke netaaon ke saath rajghat gaye
 Bapu brought the water he had brought from Mansarovar to the tomb and then marched with the opposition parties to the Ramlila Maidan from Rajghat
 teen kilo meter tak sabane padayatra kii
 This March, NCP, ZS, RJD, RLD, SP, BSP, TMC and Aam Aadmi Party leaders took part and appeared on the stage of Ramlila Maidan
 shivasena or maharashtra navnirmaan sena ne bhi is band main hissaa liya he
 Amit Shah has said in bjp's national executive that after coming in 2019, no one will be able to beat BJP for next 50 years
 unhone yah bhi saaf kiya ki ve yah baat ahankaar main nahin kar rahe balki apane kaam kii vajah se bhaajapa ko koi nahin haraa paaegaa
 In this sense, till 2069, BJP will remain the government
 amit shah kii is vinamr bhavishyavaanee ke aage bharat band kii kahani feeki ho gai he
 However, you should note that the Congress workers in Allahabad are forcing two donkeys to pull the car
 petrol ke daam badhane main in gadhon kaa kya kasoor tha
 The donkeys have told me in an exclusive conversation that they do not know that petrol has become expensive because even when cheaper, humans do not reduce the burden on their back
 bhens par chadhakar yah congressi kaaryakarta been baja rahe hai
 Normally there is a phrase of playing the bean in front of the buffalo, but here, sitting on the buffalo, playing the bean
 yah tasviir bijanour kii he
 In Ballia, Congress workers took out scooters on bullock carts
 magar jalaai nahin
 Former Congress MP RPN Singh came to Rickshawala in Padrauna
 muretha baandh kar rickshaw chalaa rahe the
 He was greeting with folded hands
 rickshaw ke peeche thele par skuti chali aa rahi thi or skuti ke peeche gas kaa silendar chalaa aa rahaa tha
 We showed in the Friday flashback how the BJP had come out with a variety of ideas during the Bharat Bandh so that those pictures could be found in the news channels and newspapers and the news of the opposition's shutdown could come prominently on the front page
 aap 11 sitambar kaa akhbaar dekh lijiega
 In many parts of the country, activists of the opposition marched with the flag banners
 kahin bazaar band rahe to kahin haive par jam ho gaya
 We have shown all this to be kept in the archive of our library
 jis tarah se aaj log 2014 ke pehle ke arun jetali, sushamaa swaraj, ravishankar prasad, shahanwaaz hossain ke bayanon kaa link viral kar rahe hai, usee tarah 2069 ke baad mere prime time kaa link share karenge kyonki amit shah ne kaha he ki 2019 main jeetne ke baad bhaajapa ko 50 saal tak koi nahin haraa sakegaa
 BJP leader and Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad termed the bandh as a democratic right and said who is responsible for the violence that has taken place
 unhone kaha ki congress or vipaksh ke log gusse main khoff paidaa kar rahe hai
 Criticizing all these things, Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the increase in the price of petrol diesel is out of our hands
 to aapane suna
 The increase of diesel and petrol is out of our hands
 kya yahi antarrashtriya kaaran bijepi ke bharat band ke samay nahin rahe honge
 Then why did the opposition stop India
 tab kyon ravishankar prasad ne band main hissaa lete hue cycle chalaai thi
 In one video, Ravi Shankar Prasad is seen cycling against the price of petrol diesel
 us samay bhi to antarrashtriya kaaran the
 The price of crude oil went up to USD 109 per barrel
 tab arun jetali ne kaha tha ki 90 dollar prati bairal hone par petrol 50 rupee litre hona chahie
 At the moment it is $ 78 per barrel, why don't Jaitley g 50 rupees a liter of petrol
 23 may 2012 ko hamaare sahyogi channel se baat karte hue ravishankar prasad kis jaankaree ke aadhaar par antarrashtriya kaarnon ke tark ko riject kar rahe the
 Then our colleague Anchor had asked Prasad what he would have done if he was in power and he had said that when we come to power, we will manage the economy in such a way that it can tolerate such a setback
 ab sawaal unheen se he ki aapane kya manage kiya he ki jhatka bardaasht nahin ho paa rahaa he or petrol 89 rupaya litre ho gaya
 This did not happen even during the UPA
 is jawaab main ravishankar prasad yah bhi kah rahe hai ki ve kachche tel ke daam badhane kii baat samajhate hai lekin jab kachche tel kii keemat kam hoti he tab bhi sarkaar petrol deazal ke daam kam nahin karti he
 After the arrival of the Modi government in 2014, the price of crude oil in the international market had fallen to around $ 41 per barrel by 2016
 kya us anupaat main daam kam hue the jis anupaat main kachche tel kii keemat ghati thi
 In 2012, the average price of crude oil reached $ 109 per barrel
 tab dilli main may 2012 main petrol 73
 18 liters was reached
 2017 main jab kachche tel kii ausat keemat 52
 $ 51 per barrel
 tab dilli main 3 sibantar 2017 ko 69 rupee 55 paise prati litre tha
 You can see that petrol got 69 rupees liter even when the price of crude oil was around $ 51 per barrel at the time of NDAK and you gave about 69 rupees per liter when UPA was $ 107 per barrel in 2012
 yah khel he
 Today, there was a war between the Congress and the BJP through graphics on Twitter
 bijepi ne apane graphics main kachche tel kii keemton kaa anupaat nahin bataaya he
 Petrol 33 on 16 May 2004 as per the bjp's graphics chart
 71 paise litre tha jo 16 may 2009 ko 40 rupee 62 paise hua
 That is, it increased by 20 percent in five years
 phir 16 may 2014 ko 71 rupee 41 paise prati litre hua yani 75
 Rose 8 percent
 ab 10 sitambar 2018 ko 80 rupee 73 paise prati litre hua he jo 13 pratishat gata he
 Are the prices really down? iske jawaab main congress kaa twit he
 The Congress has said according to the price of crude oil
 is chart ke anusaar agast 2009 or sitambar 2018 main donon time kachche tel kii keemat 71
 9 dollars per barrel
 uske mukaable main 10 agast 2009 ko upie kii sarkaar main petrol 44 rupee 63 paise litre tha
 In the Modi government, on 10 September 2018, 80 rupees has been 73 paise per liter
 daam badha ki gata
 Janta Congress is watching bjp's Is Only Two Game
 bijepi ke graphics main daam ghate hai jabaki aapaki jeb ke hisaab se bade hai
 Did earnings grow? aanindyon chakravarti ne apane simpal samachar main bataaya he ki jidipi ke 8
 Even after being 2 percent, the real income of the people has fallen significantly
 aanidyon kaa simple samachar aap enditivi kii website par dekh sakate hai
 He says that the real income of farmers is not worth seeing or showing after adjusting the inflation from income
 april-june 2017 se april-june 2018 ke bich prati kisaan aamadani 100 rupee se badhkar 101
 60 paise has been increased
 yani 1 rupee 60 paise
 If this pace is there then it will take 44 years to become 100 to 200
 kisaanon kii aamadani tab jaakar doguni hogi
 The comments acchhee baat he ki tab tak bhaajapa kii hi sarkaar rahegi kyonki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha he ki bhaajapa kii 50 saal tak yani 2069 tak sarkaar rahegi
 It may be that the BJP continues to get immense support from the public even after petrol diesel becomes expensive and jobs are not available, but because of this the public does not have any problem
 aaj hi hindustan times ke rahul singh kii khabar he ki bhartiya sena agle 4-5 saalon main dedh lakh naukariyaan kam karne ja rahi he
