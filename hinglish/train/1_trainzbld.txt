 ''*** Former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav has attacked the Bihar government for the frequent scams being exposed in Bihar
 unhone kaha ki in sabhi ghotaalon par mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii chuppi apane aap main hi sabase bada ghotaalaa he
 Tejashwi said that every other day a new scam is uncovered in Bihar, but the Bihar government reacts shabbily to all these cases and sits silent citing the investigation
 tejasvi nekaha ki pichley kuch dinon main srijan ghotaalaa, shauchalay ghotaalaa or dustbin ghotaalaa saamne aayaa he lekin in sabhi ghotaalon kii jaanch main keval chote-mote karmchaariyon par gaaj giri he or kisi bhi bade adhikari yaa netaa ke khilaaf koi bhi kaarywahi nahin kii gai he
 Significantly, even on the last day of the current winter session of the Bihar Legislative Assembly, the RJD created a ruckus about the scams that surfaced in Bihar
 nitish par tanj kasate hue tejasvi ne kaha ki bihar ke mukhyamantri jis vibhaag main bhi apana paanv rakhte hai usee vibhaag main ghotaalaa ho jaataa he
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who has been continuously attacking RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav for corruption for the last 4 days on Twitter, said that why the Chief Minister was not saying the corruption of Jai Shah, son of BJP national president Amit Shah, after all
 Taking a tweet? Taking a dig at Nitish, Tejashwi said that he should invite Amit Shah's son to call Bihar Should and they should train new entrepreneurs here how an entrepreneur can grow his business 16000 times in a year
 tejasvi ne kaha ki 4 maheene pehle bani jediu - bijepi kii sarkaar ke kaam-kaaj ko lekar unki party bahut jaldi ek report card pesh karegi
 The real reason for Tejaswi's resentment about the Chief Minister is that Nitish has been a Twitter attacker against Lalu for the last 4 days
 lalu or unke parivaar ke kathith bhrashtachar ko lekar nitish twitor par bayaan jari kar rahe hai
 On Friday, Nitish lashed out at Lalu once again, writing on Twitter that exposing the scams and taking legal action against the scamsters is the real scam
 ghotaalon par chup rahanaa hi sabase bada ghotaalaa he or chote karmchaariyon ko hi bali bananaa sabase badi kaarywai he

 jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main 14 farvari ko hue aatankwaadi hamale main siarpief ke 40 jawan shahid ho gaye jabaki paanch anya ghayal hue the
 Pakistan-based terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed claimed responsibility for the attack
 bharat ne hamale ke baad pakistan ke khilaaf ek bada kootnithik abhiyaan shuru kiya or rajkeey niti ke taur par aatankwaad kaa istemaal karne main pakistan kii bhoomika ko ujagar kiya
 The international community under the leadership of America pressured Pakistan to stop its territory from becoming a hideout of terrorist organizations and to take action against the culprits of the Pulwama attack
 trump ne china ke up pradhanmantri liyu he nit ek chini pratinidhimandal ke saath baithak ke baad white house ke ovel offis main shuukravaar ko samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki kashmir main bahut khatarnaak sthiti he
 The President noted the possibility of a strong response from India in the wake of the terrorist attack
 bharat ke aatmaraksha ke adhikaar ke bare main puche jane par trump ne kaha ki bharat kisi majboot kadam par vichaar kar rahaa he or meraa matlab he ki bharat ne hamale main apane 50 logon ko khoyaa he
 Therefore, i can understand this as well
 dakshin asia ke in do padosi deshon ke bich tanaavpurn sthiti ke bare main puche gaye sawaalon par trump ne kaha ki america is bare main baat kar rahaa he jaisaa ki kuch anya desh kar rahe hai
 Although he did not name them
 unhone kaha ki ham baat kar rahe hai or bahut se log baaten kar rahe hai
 But right now it has to be very delicate balance
 jo kuch hua he uske kaaran bharat or pakistan ke bich bahut sari samasyaayein hai
 Trump said that a terrible thing is happening between Pakistan and India right now
 yah bahut buree sthiti he or donon deshon ke bich yah ek khatarnaak sthiti he
 We would like to see it stop
 trump ne kaha ki maine pakistan ko 1
 3 billion US dollars of subsidy stopped
 is bich, ham pakistan ke saath kuch baithken kar sakate hai
 Pakistan has taken great advantage of America during the reign of former US Presidents

 endie 339 se 365 siten
 This is the trailer of the picture of May 23, in which Narendra Modi is going to be the superhero of Indian politics again
 ajtak- exis maai india ke agsit pole ke mutabik, is baar narendra modi kii lahar nahin tsunami he
 There will be no alliance in front of it and no mathematics of opposition
 aisa lag rahaa he ki lagaataar duusari baar narendra modi, vipaksh ko puri tarah se dhwast karne ja rahe hai
 If this estimate changes in the results on May 23, then many important changes are possible in the country's politics
 
 
 
 And the image of PM Modi will be strengthened
 In this election, the way the opposition united and tried to compete against Narendra Modi
 usase yahi lag rahaa tha ki is baar shaayad bijepi bahumat ke aankade se dur rah jaae, lekin agsit pole ke anumaan ye sabit kar rahe hai ki modi he to kuch bhi mumkin he
 If the estimates prove to be correct, then in the coming five years, the image of PM Modi will be further strengthened
 notebandi, jiesti kii tarah aane vaale paanch saalon main modi or bhi bade faisle le sakate hai
 Amit Shah will grow in Modi Government Part-2 It is clear from the estimates that there is a Modi tsunami in the country
 is tsunami ke superhiro piem narendra modi hai to hero bijepi adhyaksh amit shah
 The questions which were being raised about the defeat of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh on Amit Shah, who are always in discussion about their booth management, will be silenced and once again their Chanakya policy will be praised everywhere
 aane vaale paanch saal main amit shah kaa kad modi sarkaar part-2 main kaaphi bada ho saktaa he
 The future of the opposition's alliances in Adhar, even though after the exit poll, the opposition is asking to wait till May 23 and has set its hopes on the day of May 23, but a trend is visible from the exit polls that Narendra Modi's There is no one in Indian politics at this time to give a name to the competition
 upi jaise rajya main jahaan mayawati or akhilesh ne badi chunauti di thi, vahaan par narendra modi is chunavi jodi ko buree tarah se dhwast karte dikh rahe hai
 It is clear from the projections that the Modi tsunami has become a matter of concern for the opposition
 chintaa kii baat un gathbandhanon ke liye bhi he, jo modi ke vijay rath ko rokane ke liye banaae gaye the
 Their future is in danger
 congress main rahul par phir uthenge savainumaanon se sabase zyada bechaini congress main ho sakati he
 The Congress fought this election very aggressively
 rahul gandhi ke saath hi priyanka gandhi ne raajnneeti main aadhikarik entry lene ke baad modi sarkaar ko har jagah gheraa, lekin agsit pole ke anumaan bataa rahe hai ki bhai-bahan kii yah jodi modi ke vijay rath ko rokane main kaamyaab nahin ho saki
 Like 2014, the performance of the Congress in 2019 is expected to be average
 aise main congress ke bheetar ek bada uthal-puthal ho saktaa he
 Questions can be raised on Rahul Gandhi's leadership ability
 bengal, karnataka or madhyapradesh kii sarkaar par khataryanumaan agar sach sabit hote hai to congress ke liye ek or badi khatre kii ghanti baj sakati he
 After the Modi tsunami, the bjp's entire focus may be on running Operation Lotus against the state governments of West Bengal, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh
 bengal main piem modi kah chuke hai ki unke sampark main tiemasi ke 40 vidhayak hai
 Whereas BJP has run Operation Lotus twice in Karnataka
 ab teesri baar bhi oparation lotus chalaakar bijepi vahaan takhtapalat karne kii koshish kar sakati he
 Apart from this, the clouds of Madhya Pradesh's Kamal Nath government may also be under threat
 bijepi vahaan bhi sarkaar banane kii koshish kar sakati he
 Estimates of exit polls will be available in the coming elections, it is the fact that Narendra Modi has not only saved his 2014 stronghold, but has also gone to others' stronghold and electoral strike
 ab bijepi kii taiyaari aane vaale vidhansabha chunaavon ko lekar hogi
 After coming back to power at the Center with a strong majority, the BJP will be strong and with full force it will put its full force in these assembly elections
 dilli, haryana, jammu- kashmir, maharashtra, jharkhand jaise bade rajyon main is saal hi vidhansabha chunaav ho sakate hai
 In these states, BJP will get the benefit of Modi Tsunami
 lagaataar duusari baar banaaenge purna bahumat kii sarkaaregjit pole ke mutabik, endie ko 339 se 365, upie ko 77 se 108 or anya dalon ko 69 se 95 siten mil sakati hai
 If more or less the same figures remain on May 23, then this will be the first time since 1971 that a leader will come to government with an absolute majority for the second time in a row
 ye karishma 1971 main indira gandhi ne kiya tha or ab narendra modi aisa karishma karne vaale hai, kyonki anumaan yahi bataa rahaa he ki puure desh main modi tsunami he

 cyna nehwal ol england badminton open ke semifinal main pahunch gai hai
 He defeated China's Yihan Wang 21–19 21–6 in the quarter-final
 cyna ko ye match jeetne main mahaj 39 minute kaa samay laga
 This is the first time Nehwal has defeated Wang
 ise unke kariyar kii sabase badi jeet ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 Saina will take on Sun Yoon of China in the semi-finals
 cyna ke kariyar main ye doosraa mauka he jab ve ol england badminton championships ke semifinal main pahunchi hai
 Earlier in 2010 too, Saina Nehwal reached the semi-finals here, but Yihan could not overcome Wang's challenge
 lekin is baar china kii sheersh teen khilaadi toornament ke semifinal daud se pehle hi baahar ho chuki hai, aise main cyna nehwal ke saamne ol england badminton championships jeetne kaa behtareen mauka he
 Saina is yet to win the title
 haalanki 1980 main prakaash padukon or 2001 main pulela gopichand yahaan kamyaabi hasil kar chuke hai
 i have resigned from AAP & handed over resignation to Kejriwal ji today
 Though he asked me not to resign but i insisted
 Will be briefing media tomorrow at 4pm at Press Club, Raisina Rd, New Delhi to explain the reason of leaving AAP & my further plans
 bataa den ki eches phulka march 2017 main punjab main netaa vipaksh bane the,lekin kuch hi samay baad unhone netaa vipaksh pad se yah kahkar istipha de diya tha ki vah 1984 ke cese par focus karnaa chaahate hai
 In 2015, he also resigned from the legislative assembly to protest against the lax attitude of the Punjab government in the case of the absurdity of Guru Granth Sahib
 kaaphi samay se phulka aam aadmi party kii baithkon main nazar nahin aa rahe the
 Phoolka had said publicly that i will resign if the Aam Aadmi Party has an alliance with the Congress
 haalanki ab aam aadmi party kaa congress se gathbandhan hone nahin ja rahaa
 In this case, why has Phulka resigned from the Aam Aadmi Party? The possibility is that when HS Phoolka is neither an opposition nor an MLA and he is not even close to the party high command, what will he do while staying in the AAP? By this, Sikhs will fight for the society if they break away from the good party and more credibility will be created
 isliye unhone party se istifa diya ho
 Let me tell you that the decision came in 1984 anti-sikh riots and Sajjan Kumar has been sentenced to life imprisonment
 aapako bataa den ki phulka (HS Phoolka) ne danga peediton kaa cese ladane ke liye koi fees nahin lee
 In this battle of HS Phulka, his wife Maninder Kaur stood by every step
 kaha jaataa he ki phulka ke sahyog ke liye unhone apni naukari tak chhod di
 Baby, who hails from Bihar, was made High Commissioner of Canada for a day on the occasion of 'international Girl Child Day'

 @ bjp4india— BL Santhosh (@blsanthosh) October 15, 2019 Why did the former PM surround the Modi government? This stance of BL Santosh is against those who have been outspoken and criticized the policies of the BJP recently
 sitambar main purv pradhanmantri doctor manmohan singh ne arthvyavastha ko lekar modi sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 He had said that the economy is going from bad to very bad and the dangerous thing is that the government does not realize this
 ham aarthik mandi ke daur main hai
 The growth rate has come down to 5 percent
 nobel vijeta ko kyon pasand nahin sarkaar kii nitiyambhartiya mul ke america naagarik abhijit banerjeeko 2019 ke arthshaastra ke nobel puraskaar se nawaja gaya he
 After winning the award, he said that the state of India's economy is disastrous
 maujuuda data se yah aashwaasan nahin miltaa ki arthvyavastha kii sehat main jald sudhaar aayega
 However, now the Indian government has also started feeling that the condition of the economy is really bad

 He said that the government has not been able to present any roadmap to deal with this crisis
 paanch karod rupye se zyada kii rakam kharch kar di gai
 Years were spent, but she did not have children
 baat ho rahi he us pahari maina kii, jo chhattisgarh main luptpraaya ho rahi he, jise chhattisgarh sarkaar ne apana rajkeey pakshi ghoshit kiya he
 Till some time these maina were easily seen in the border areas of Bastar, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha in Chhattisgarh, but now it is not so
 isi se chintit sarkaar ne isaki sud lee or maina ko bachaane kii thaanee
 In the forest school of Bastar, a hill myna was added in a very wide cage to raise children and increase the number of myna, but many breeding attempts made for ten years proved to be a failure and the couple was two
 Could not be three
 van praani santhaan dehradun or kolkata ke export doctoron ne bhi is maina ke prajnan ke liye kai nuskhe aajamaae, lekin nateeja sifer rahaa
 The Forest Department has not been able to achieve this direction yet
 vahiin, is maina ko bachaane or inaki sankhya badhaane ke liye van vibhaag ab jangalon main unheen prajatiyon ke ped lagane par jor de rahaa he, jo is pahari maina ko pasand hai
 The Government feels that the family of Pahari Maina can flourish in the lap of nature itself
 iske alaava van praani adhinium ke tahat rajya sarkaar ne is maina ke shikaar par pratibandh laga diya he
 Provision has been made for the punishment and fine of up to ten years to the person found guilty of its victim
 prakritik vaataavaran nahin milachhattisgarh ke chif wild life warden ram prakaash kaa kahana he ki captive breeding ke liye ek vriksh ko gherkar usamen maina rakhi gayi
 But it could not be reproduced
 kabhi koi anda hua bhi to vah cervive nahin kiya
 They believe that Maina does not find the environment it wants naturally
 haalanki maina ko pinjre main taaja falon se lekar kai tarah kii saag-bhaaji di jaati he
 Her health is taken care of
 van vibhaag kii ek team uski rakhwali ke liye choubiso ghante tainaat rahati he
 The Forest Department's argument that Maina is unable to bear children is that due to the noise of the railway tracks behind the cage and on the roads in front, this Maina's lap is still deserted
 ab hoga is maina kaa DNA testavibhaag kaa kahana he ki maina kii yah pahchaan karnaa ki koun nar he or koun maadaa, yah kaaphi mushkil he
 In order to start the reproduction process anew, the department is preparing DNA tests of Myna
 rajya ke ek chif wild life warden kaa yah bhi kahana he ki abhi bharat main pakshiyon ke prajnan par zyada kaam nahin hua he
 Many attempts have been made, but have not been successful
 insaanon kii hoobahoo nakal kar leti he ye mynis maina kii sabase badi khaasiyat ye he ki yah manushyon kii aawaaj kii hoobahoo nakal kar leti he
 You must have seen and heard the parrot usually, but this myna can speak the speech of humans and in a much clearer voice than a parrot
 kyon laapata hui ye khubasurat maina?shikaar ke shaukeen logon ne is maina ko apana nishaanaa banaaya to kabhi maansaahaar ke liye ise maaraa gaya
 As a result, this hill myna disappeared
 bastar kii vaadiyon main ab kuch gini chuni hi pahari maina bachi hai
 What does this myna want? Hill myna loves lake waterfalls and open fields to fly

 Shah Rukh Khan's next film 'zero' had long awaited the audience
 aakhirkaar, iskaa trailor shuukravaar ko unke janmdin par relies kar diya gaya
 The film's story can be easily guessed by watching the trailer
 trailor main jiro ek lav story najar aa rahi he
 But this love story is special because a 38-year-old dwarf falls in love with a girl in a wheelchair
 jiro kaa trailor: ye 8 samvaad shahrukh kii film ko banaate hai khasaye meerut ke rahane vaale baua singh thakur kii kahani he, jo 38 saal ke ho gaye hai, lekin bounepan ke kaaran unki shaadi ab tak nahin ho pai
 One day, Anushka Sharma gets a photo of his hand and he gives her his heart
 metromonial vaale baua ko bataate hai ki ladki hilti bahut he, lekin baua iskaa matlab samaj nahin pate, jab hakeekat main anoushka ko wheelchair par baitha dekhte hai to unke kabutar ud jate hai
 Actually, the baua reach the pigeon with the hand
 jiro kaa trailor: shahrukh kii film kaa ye he meerut se conectioniske baad shuru hoti he donon kii lav story
 Gradually, Anushka also likes Baua
 isi dauraan katrina caff kii entry hoti he
 Actually, Katrina is Bua's childhood love, but due to Boua being dwarf, Katrina's path gets separated and she becomes a big star
 baua katrina ko bhi nahin bhuulaa pate
 Both of them become friends from back
 is bich ye kahani ek lav tringal kaa rup le leti he
 Also, in love, the baua becomes a lover who does anything
 shahrukh or anoushka kii adaakaari ek tarafa najar aa rahi he
 She is very much like Barfi's Priyanka Chopra
 film ke dialog bhi hansaane vaale hai
 Salman called the dwarves and said about Shah Rukh's zero, the story of a dwarf human being troubled by not being married was not shown in any Hindi film yet
 story asaadhaaran he, isliye darshakon ko pasand aa sakati he
 Perhaps Tigmanshu Dhulia plays Shahrukh's father
 baua kii apane pita se nahin banati
 In this way a complex chemistry of relationships appears
 film ke gane or sound score bhi parfect najar aa rahaa he
 a final opinion can be formed only after watching the rest of the film
 kuch milakar ek pehle kabhi na dekhi jane vaali film nirdeshak anand el raay lekar aa rahe hai, jo shaayad nai bahes ko janm de
 The film is releasing on December 21
 film ko christmas kii chuttee kaa laabh milanaa swaabhaavik he

 arabiai kii ore se byaaj daron main katautee kaa kaaran lagaataar girti mahangaai or aage bhi iske kaabo main rahane kii sambhaavna he

 Apart from this, another major reason was the end of the shutdown in America

 *** The Rio Olympic Organizing Committee has threatened to cancel the accreditation of India's Sports Minister Vijay Goel
 aayojakon kaa kahana he ki goyal kaaphi aakraamak or abhadra hai, or wo bagaiyr acridation vaale logon ko aayojan sthalon ke andar pravesh karaane kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 In a letter written to the Indian delegation chief Rakesh Gupta, the Sports Minister's threat to cancel the Accreditation Card, the Rio 2016 Organizing Committee's Continental Manager Sarah Peterson has said that it has happened many times that Goyal has tried to get unrecognized people inside the venue Has yahaan tak kii mantri ke saath maujuud log staff ke saath kaaphi abhadrata ke saath pesh aae hai
 The staff members have just tried to convince them that they are not allowed to go inside the letter of recognition

 These cases have been reported from 2016 to 30 June 2019
 kendriya mantri ne kaha ki jaanch agency sibiai ke paas karpshan ke aantarik maamalon se nipatane ke liye ek system he
 Jitendra Singh said that action is taken when the department receives complaints against its officers
 unhone kaha ki sibiai adhikariyon ke bich peshewar shuchita kaayam rakhane ke liye lagaataar kadam uthaae jate hai
 Let us know that in October last year, CBI had registered a case of taking bribe against Rakesh Asthana, the then Special Director of his own department
 iske alaava sibiai ke police upaadheekshak devendra kumaar ke khilaaf bhi cese darj kiya gaya tha
 In view of the displeasure of the Dalit community, the Narendra Modi government of the Center has taken a step to restore the Scheduled Castes / Scheduled Tribes (SC / ST) Act to its old and original form
 SC / ST act sanshodhan vidheyak ko cabinet se manjuuri milane ke baad loksabhaa main pesh kiya gaya, jis par aaj sadan main charchaa honi he
 Through this, it will be clear that what the Nazaris keep on this issue from the ruling party to the opposition
 bataa den ki isi saal 21 march ko supreme court ne anusuchit jati or anusuchit janajati atyaachaar nivaaran adhinium (essi / asti act 1989) ke tahat darj maamalon main tatkaal giraftaar par roak laga di thi
 The court ruled that the arrest of government employees can be done only after the permission of the competent authority

 There was violence in many areas in the Dalit movement across the country, in which a dozen people died
 supreme court ke faisle ke liye modi sarkaar ko jimmedaar maanate hue dalit samaaj centre sarkaar se apni naaraazgi jataa rahaa tha
 The central government and the BJP were said to be anti-dalit
 dalit sanghathanon ne sarkaar ko ek baar phir ultimatum de rakhaa he ki agar 9 agast tak essi-asti act ko puraane swaroop main laane vaala kanoon nahin bana to wo bade paimaane par virodh pradarshan karenge
 In view of the displeasure of the Dalits, the Modi government decided to bring the SC / ST Act to its original form
 sarkaar ne is sanshodhan vidhyak ko cabinet se manjuuri ke baad loksabhaa main shuukravaar ko pesh kiya tha
 This discussion legislator is to be discussed in the House today
 dalit maton ko raajnneetik takat ko dekhte hue nahin lagata he ki sadan main aaj koi iskaa virodh karegaa
 In this way, it will come back to its original form and the reshuffle of the Supreme Court will have no meaning

 Through this, the old law will be restored

 - The accused will not be able to get anticipatory bail, regular bail will be available from the High Court itself
 -essi / asti maamle main jaanch inspector rank ke police afasar karenge
 - a complaint will be registered immediately on the complaint related to the use of descriptive words
 -essi / asti maamalon kii sunwaayee sirf special court main hogi
 - The investigating agency will not have to take permission from the authority before filing a charge sheet against the government employee in court
 supreme court ne kiya tha ye badlaav-essi / asti act ke maamalon main turant giraftaar nahin kii jaaegi
 - a lawsuit will not be filed immediately if a complaint is received

 In any case, check should not be more than 7 days
 dspi shuruaati jaanch kar nateeja nikaalenge ki shikaayat ke mutabik kya koi maamla banataa he yaa phir kisi tareeke se jhuthe aarope lagaakar fansaaya ja rahaa he?-supreme court ne is act ke bade paimaane par galat istemaal kii baat ko maanate hue kaha tha ki is maamle main sarkari karmchaaree agrim jamaanat ke liye aavedan kar sakate hai
 When the accused is accused of using the word caste under the SC / ST Act, he had to review the reasons for the arrest before deciding to extend the custody of the accused
 -sarkari karmchaariyon kii giraftaar sirf sakasham athurity kii ijaajat ke baad hi ho sakati he
 - Officers who violate the guidelines, will also face departmental action and contempt of court proceedings
 lekin ab modi sarkaar vidheyak ke jariye is faisle ko palatney ja rahi he or isse essi / asti apane mul swaroop main aa jayega
 The Central Government has consulted the Chief Minister of the states on its proposed new education policy

 Nitish Kumar said that he has seen the Centre's letter, but there is neither time nor priority regarding this education policy because the situation of both floods and drought in the state is quite odd

 In the year 2017, many celebrities got eliminated from the stage of politics, so many celebrities gave up their physical body from the worldly world
 haalanki samay chakra par kisi kaa vash nahin he, lekin siyaasi uthapatak ke lihaaj se saal 2017 rochak rahaa
 When new faces took place on the political board, well-known men had to go back into the background
 kisi kii bhoomika apane hi dal main sikud gai to kisi ke liye bhavishya sangharshon se bharaa najar aane laga
 Let's take a look at these political personalities
 
 
 jinhone apni raajnneetik paridhi par ek or chakra puraa kiya
 Sonia Gandhi, after holding the post of Congress President for 19 years, handed over the command of the party to Rahul Gandhi in December 2017
 sonia ke adhyaksh rahete hue congress ne kai safaltaaen hasil kii to asafalataaon ko bhi dekha
 When Sonia saved the Congress from a moribund condition and put her in power, it was a miracle of her political acumen and courage
 2004 main vaajapeyi sarkaar ko chunaavon main patkhni dekar sonia ne congress kii satta main vaapasi karai to 2009 main unke adhyaksh rahete hue congress ne apni safalataa doharaai
 He is also credited for starting people-oriented schemes like Right to Information and Right to Food, so no one can take away the credit of generating employment at a rural level with a scheme like MNREGA
 sonia ne bhale hi congress adhyaksh kaa pad tyaag diya ho, lekin unhone raajnneeti nahin chodi he
 She is the party's MP from Rae Bareli and is part of the Congress Working Committee
 adhyaksh pad chhodane ke saath hi unki bhoomika simat gai he, unka swasthya congress party ke liye chintaa kaa vishay he
 But it remains to be seen what role the former Congress president accepts for herself in the future
 mayawati2017 ke upi vidhansabha chunaavon ne bahujan samaaj party kii supremeo mayawati ke saamne astitv bachaane kaa sankat khadaa kar diya he
 The condition of the party is not very good
 party ke bade stambh ek-ek kar unka saath chhodte ja rahe hai
 The bsp's performance in the state assembly elections after the Lok Sabha elections has also been worrying
 aise menmayawatiki bhoomika rashtriya or pradesh kii raajnneeti main simatati chali gai he
 The challenge before Mayawati is to re-create the party in a manner
 mayawati khud kahati rahi hai ki basapa sirf ek party nahin balki andolan he, to unhen party ko apane paariwarik daayre se baahar nikaalkar andolan kii shakl main dobaaraa khadaa karnaa he
 The bsp's performance has risen in the results of the civic elections held in December
 
 
 lekin rashtriya raajnneeti kii pehali pankti main khadaa hone ke liye mayawati ko abhi milon chalanaa he
 Mulayam, who was once the face of Samajwadi Party, has now gone behind the scenes and has been replaced by his son Akhilesh
 upi vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle mulaayam parivaar main khub kalah hui
 Akhilesh and his uncles got into trouble with the head
 ramgopal akhilesh kii taraf se ladate rahe to shivpal mulaayam ke sahare
 
 
 As a result, the party got torn up and Akhilesh collected a coin on the Samajwadi Party
 shivpal or ramgopalparty se andar baahar hote rahe or mulaayam unhen manaate rahe
 But the party's bitter defeat in the assembly elections left SP out of power
 akhilesh ko karaari haar jhelni padi
 But Akhilesh did not return the post of party president to his father 
 haal hi main sampann hue nikaay chunaavon main shaharon main party ko bahut zyada safalataa nahin mili he
 Mulayam, the MP from Azamgarh, is now more in the role of a father than a party patron
 21 november ko akhilesh ne apane pita kaa janmdin manaaya, to kaarykram main na shivpal najar aae or na ramgopal
 The two brothers, once the right and left hand of Mulayam, now stand apart from the central roles of the party
 haalanki ramgopal party ke rajyasabha saansad hai, lekin ab nitiyaan mulaayam ke bajaay akhilesh hi tay karte hai
 The sun of Mulayam's political career is moving towards the west
 laalakashna adwani2014 ke aam chunaav se pehle jab bijepi ne narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaaya, to samajha gaya ki shaayad bhavishya main party apane louhpurush laalkrishna adwani ko kisi sanvaidhanik pad par bithaae
 
 
 But all these remain speculative
 2014 main bijepi ne narendra modi kii aguwai main aam chunaavon main badi jeet hasil kii or phir peeche mudakar nahin dekha
 Modi's trusted Amit Shah won the party more than 70 Lok Sabha seats in UP
 yahaan se narendra modi or amit shah bijepi ke centre main aa gaye
 He now had the right to decide the policies and policies of the party
 narendra modine amit shah ko bijepi adhyaksh banaaya or adwani sahit varisht netaaon ko maardarshak mandal main daal diya
 Advani, MP from Gandhinagar in Gujarat, slowly drifted into silence
 2017 main raashtrapati kaa chunaav aayaa, to bahut logon ko ummid thi ki party adwani ko aage kar sakati he
 But Modi chose Bihar Governor Ramnath Kovind
 kabhi piem in vatting qaraar die gaye adwani ramnath kovind ke prastaavkon main se ek bane
 In 2017, one of the three years of the Modi government, it became more clear that Advani's role in the party is now left only to the blessed elder
 unhen party ke kaaryakramon or sansad ke galiyaaron main dekha ja saktaa he, lekin siyaasi masalon par unhone munh band rakhaa he
 Sharad Yadav: For a long time, Sharad Yadav, who was an associate of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, had a year of ups and downs
 jis bijpi ke khilaaf sharad yadav ne nitish kumaar ke liye lalu yadav ke saath mahagathbandhan banane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 The same Sharad Yadav was pushed to the margins by Nitish Kumar first and then stripped of his Rajya Sabha membership
 sharad yadav ne bihar main mahagathbandhan ke liye bahut kaam kiya tha or bijepi ke ashwamedh ghode ko bihar main rokane main safalataa bhi pai thi
 But Nitish Kumar broke hands with the BJP in 2017 and joined hands with the BJP
 sharad yadav ke liye ise bardaasht kar paanaa mushkil tha
 He opposed this and launched a campaign against this decision at the national level
 lekin kuch samay baad unka abhiyaan kamjor padataa gaya
 Sharad Yadav and his colleagues supported the Congress in the Gujarat assembly elections, but the challenge before Sharad Yadav himself is to save his political existence
 na to ve saansad rahe or na hi kisi party main
 
 
 There is not even a huge support base behind them
 dekhnaa ye he ki sharad yadav kii raajnneeti 2018 main koun sa mode leti he
 In 2017, he died as a daily avasanapriranjan Das Munshi: Senior Congress leader and former Union Minister Priya Ranjan Dasmunsi died in Delhi on 20 November 2017
 saal 2008 se coma main rahe dasamunshi 72 varsh kii avasthaa main paralok sidhaar gaye
 Sultan Ahmed: Former Union Minister and Trinamool Congress MP Sultan Ahmed died on 4 September 2017 in Kolkata due to a heart attack
 saanvarlaal jatahpurv kendriya mantri or rajasthan ke ajmer se bijepi saansad saanwar laal jat kaa 9 agast 2017 ko dilli main nidhan ho gaya
 Santosh Mohan Dev: Former Union Minister Santosh Mohan Dev died in August this year in his hometown of Silchar
 83 varsh kii avasthaa main dev kidney or anya bimariyon se jujh rahe the
 Anil Madhav Dave: Anil Madhav Dave, who was the Union Minister of State for Environment, died in May at the age of 60

 Ahmed: Former Union Minister E
 ahamed kaa 1 farvari 2017 ko nidhan ho gaya
 Ahmed suffered a heart attack in the Parliament House, at the age of 78, he left the world
 bihar ke upmukhyamantri susheel modi ne kaha he ki purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne aresas ke kaarykram main shaamil hone kaa nirnay lekar bahudaleey loktantr main raajnneetik chuaachhut samaapt karne kaa sandesh diya he
 Attacking Congress, Sushil Modi said that instead of welcoming it, the chest of those doing politics of propaganda is bursting
 unhone twit kiya, 'aresas ke sansthaapak sarasanghachaalak dow
 In 1934 Mahatma Gandhi attended the training camp of the Sangh organized at Wardha on Hedgewar's insistence
 gandhiji ne 16 sitambar 1947 ko dilli main sangh ke swayamsevakon ko sambodhit kiya
 'the Deputy Chief Minister said,' At the invitation of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in the year 1963, the RSS volunteers joined the Republic Day parade
 sangh ke varisht netaa ekanath ranade kaa aamantran sweekaar kar pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne vivekanand shilasmarak kaa udghaatan kiya tha
 Congressmen who do not even know about gandhi-nehru are questioning Pranab Mukherjee
 modi ne yah bhi kaha ki bihar andolan ke dauraanrashtriya swayamsevak sanghane mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi or lokanayak jepi ne 1977 main sangh ke kaarykram main shaamil hokar raajnneetik dalon ke bich vaicharik samvaad badhaane kaa sandesh diya tha
 The conspiracy to discredit the Union that stands with the country in times of national crisis, emergency and natural disaster will never succeed
 darasal,congresske kai netaa maan rahe hai ki pranab mukherjee kaa aresas ke kaarykram main janaa party or 'secular' kheme ke liye nuksaandeh he
 These leaders say that the leader of the 'secular' party going to the headquarters of the RSS means to give him recognition in a way that has been 'untouchable' for the Congress till now and Rahul Gandhi in every speech which he would attack Have been
 narendra modi sarkaar ke shuruaati 100 dinon kii charchaa soshal media par bhi chai hui he
 There is a trend of war and counterattack between both BJP supporters and opponents on Twitter
 bijepi samarthak '100 achche dinon' kaa jashn manaa rahe hai, lekin virdohi kaale dhan kaa pataa puch rahe hai
 Twitter has topped # 100acchedin in Top Trade since morning, while # whereisblackmoney of opponents is at number three
 gauratlab he ki chunaav se pehle tatkaaleen bijepi adhyaksh or maujuuda grih mantri rajnath singh ne thane main 100 din main kaala dhan waapas laane kaa vaada kiya tha
 Baba Ramdev, who went out on Modi's campaign, also said in Bhubaneswar in April that black money will be brought back within 100 days if the government is formed
 virdohi ab inhen bayanon kaa aadhaar banaakar modi sarkaar par vaadakhilaphi kaa aarope laga rahe hai

 They make me very upset
 peedit ladki ne apana pataa thikaana bhi bataaya or raksha team sejald ghar aane kii guhaarlagai
 The manner in which the girl spoke, it was suspected that something was going wrong with her
 lihaaja mahila raksha team bagaiyr der kiye us lokation par ravaanaa ho gai
 The girl opened the door and knocked the members of the women's defense team into the drawing room
 mahila raksha team kaa shaq or gaharaa gaya
 On the other hand, the girl called her mother first and then called her father
 iske baad bade maasoomiyat bhare andaaj main shikaayat karte hue kaha ki uske papa use mobile par baat nahin karne dete or watsape bhi dekhne nahin dete
 Papa has also beaten him several times
 kuch der pehle unhone use khub danta bhi he
 So put them in jail
 mahila raksha team kii prabharee inspector deepa kevat yah sab dekh sunakar hairat main pad gayi
 However he explained to the father-daughter and the team returned

 kareeb bees saal jail main rahane baad algaavvaadi netaa masarat alam bhatta ko ek baar phir adaalat ne rihaai kaa aadesh diya he
 Hurriyat Conference leader and Muslim League president Masrat has got bail, but it is unlikely that he could be released from jail
 kyonki abtak ye hota aayaa he ki rajya kii pidipi or bijepi gathbandhan kii sarkaar use kisi na kisi maamle main aaropee bana kar uski giraftaar kaa aadesh jari kar detii he
 The court of the magistrate of Srinagar has ordered the release but has not been released yet

 After the impeachment against Chief Justice Dipak Misra of the country, the stand of the Congress has now raised many intriguing questions
 masalan congress supreme court main yachika daayar karti he to koun si bench is par sunwaayee karegi? sijeai master of roster hai
 What will be his role now? Now what will be the future of impeachment has become a very difficult question
 maamla itnaa pechida ho gaya he ki is par ab samvidhan kii nai vyakhya karne kii jarurat mahasoos kii ja rahi he
 What will be the outcome of the petition on impeachment can be understood through these 10 questions
 pehla sawaal: mahabhiyog kii prakriya prashasnic he yaa vidhaayi?sabase pehle to ye hi tay karnaa mushkil he ki mahabhiyog kii prakriya prashasnic he yaa vidhaayi
 The constitution is silent as far as its administrative is concerned
 agar yah maamla vidhaayi he to aise main iske istemaal kaa koi mauka ab tak aayaa hi nahin
 That is, no Nazir is found
 agar maamla vidhaayi he to nyaaypalika isamen dakhal hi nahin degi or prashasnic he to jeudicial rivyuu koun karegaa?doosraa sawaal: koun si bench karegi congress kii yachika par sunwaayee?mahabhiyog par agar jeudicial rivyuu ho to bada mudda yah ki supreme court main is yachika kii sunwaayee koun si peeth karegi? maamla supreme court gaya to vahaan yah koun tay karegaa ki koun si peeth vipaksh kii us yachika ko sune jisamen rajyasabha ke sabhapati ke kadam ko chunauti di gai he
 Third question: CJI Deepak Mishra to hear the charge on himself? Since the impeachment master of roster is only on CJI Deepak Mishra
 aise main sawaal he ki kya ve khud hi apane khilaaf laae gaye mahabhiyog par daayar yachika kii sunwaayee karenge? aisa karnaa tark sangat nahin lagata
 In such a case, if not the CJI, who will hear the same difficult question? Fourth question: The role of the top four judges who accused the CJI? In the seniority order, the four post-cji judges accused Deepak Mishra on January 12 this year
 number do justise chelmeshwar ke saath number teen justise tarun gogoi, number chaar madan bi lokur or number paanch courian joseph ne ek saath media ke saamne aakar khuleam sijeai par aaropon kii bauchhaar kii thi
 This was the first time in the history of the country
 ise nyaaypalika kaa kaala din tak qaraar de diya gaya tha
 In such a case, the benches of these four judges will hear on the petition of Congress, this is also not logical
 paanchavaa sawaal: supreme court ke sheersh paanch jaj nahin to koun karegaa sunwaayee?jin par aarope laga, ve supreme court ke mukhya nyaayadhish or aarope lagane vaale unke thik baad ke varisht chaar jaj
 That is, the top five judges in the seniority order should hear the petition, the doubt on this
 aise main bachate hai varishthata kram main number chah se number das tak ke justise
 That is, Justice AK Sikri, Justice Sharad Bobde, Justice RK Aggarwal, Justice MV Ramana and Justice Arun Mishra only survive the seniority order
 to kya in jajon par yachika par sunwaayee kii jimmedaari aegi?chatha sawaal: sijeai tay karenge ki koun karegaa sunwaayee?chunki master of roster sijeai deepak mishra hai
 They have the right to refer the matter to any bench
 sheersh paanch jaj yachika par sunwaayee karenge, isaki sambhaavna behad kam he
 In such a situation, it is more likely that either the CJI will form the second major bench or the judges from the number six to tenth will hear this petition
 purv atorni general mukul rohtagi kaa bhi maananaa he ki yachika par sunwaayee chathe number ke jaj karen to acha hoga
 Seventh question: Can the Vice President go after the President's decision to reject the impeachment motion? It is up to the discretion of the Vice President to approve or not to approve the impeachment decision
 unhone apana faisla suna diya he
 In such a way, the way to the President is also closed
 ek maatr rasta supreme court hi he
 There is also a hearing crisis as to which bench will see it
 aathvaan sawaal: legal ground par congress kii yachika kitni majboot?uparashtrapati ne mahabhiyog ke prastaav ko thos sabooton ke abhaav main khaarij kar diya he
 The allegations against the CJI have been termed by Venkaiah Naidu as a fantasy
 ab congress ko apni yachika daayar karne se pehle sabit karnaa hoga ki uske aarope legal ground par bhi majboot hai
 Ninth question: If the CJI petition is heard, will the CJI leave the post? The Congress is demanding that the CJI should leave the post after being accused
 congress netaa kapil sibbal ne to elaan bhi kar diya ki sijeai deepak mishra ke pad par bane rahane tak ve unki court main nahin jaaenge
 In such a situation, there are also questions whether Deepak Mishra will leave the post till the hearing is over? Retired Judge SN Dhingra from Delhi High Court says that this is not necessary
 sijeai chahen to ve supreme court ke register general se ye maamla kisi duusari bench ko bhejne ke liye kah sakate hai
 Tenth question: Did the Vice President take a hasty decision? The Vice President's decision is also being debated
 congress kaa kahana he ki uparashtrapati ko ek samiti kaa gathan karnaa chahie tha jo aaropon kii jaanch karata
 The Congress maintains that the Chairman's role in the initial process of impeachment motion is limited
 unke prastaav ko bina jaanch karaae hi khaarij kar diya gaya
 The Congress claims that the evidence of the allegations is with the CBI and other agencies
 lihaaja pehle jaanch karana chahie tha
 Japan and the US Navy conducted a joint military exercise in the East China Sea
 yah sainya abhyaas uttar korea ko phir se chetane ke liye kiya gaya he
 North Korea recently launched missile launches, ignoring the warning from the international community, including the US and Japan, which has deepened tensions in the region since

 At the same time, Japan Defense Ministry has refused to say anything in the case
 haalanki japan main america nausena ne kaha ki vah un par najar banaae hue hai
 The military exercise came to light after the launch of four ballistic missiles by North Korea on Monday

 (from input language) INX media maamle (INX Media Case)main purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram ne supreme court (supreme Court)main jamaanat arji daakhil kii he
 Chidambaram demanded an early hearing from the Supreme Court on his petition

 Justice NV Ramana said that the CJI will decide whether the case will be heard on Friday
 justise ramana ne maamle ko list karne ke liye CJI ke paas bheja
 Please tell, the Delhi High Court refused to grant bail to Chidambaram
 chidambaram ne isi faisle ko supreme court main chunauti di he
 Let me tell you, the Delhi High Court on Monday rejected his bail plea in the INX Media corruption case, saying that the investigation is in advanced stage and there is no denying that he can influence the witnesses
 ucch nyaayalay ne chidambaram kii yachika khaarij karne ke dauraan kadi tippaniyan karte hue kaha ki is baat main koi andeh nahin he ki agar chidambaram ke khilaaf maamla sabit hua to yah samaaj, arthvyavastha, vittiya sthirataa or desh kii akhandta ke saath kiya gaya aparaadh he
 The court said that there is no danger of Chidambaram fleeing abroad and there is no doubt that he can tamper with the evidence but if he is granted bail then he can influence the witnesses
 nyaayamurti suresh kait ne jamaanat yachika khaarij karte hue kaha ki aarthik aparaadh ek alag varg hai or yah khud ek varg banaate hai, kyonki yah lok prashasan main eemaandaaree or shuddhta kii jad ko kaat detaa he
 It destroys public confidence in the elected government
 chidambaram ko 21 agast ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 He has been in custody since then
 adaalat ne kaha ki isamen koi andeh nahin he ki chidambaram majboot vitt or grih mantri rahe hai or philhal vah rajyasabha ke sadsy hai
 The court said, "he is a respected member of the Bar Association of the Supreme Court
" vah varisht adhivaktaa ke taur par lambey vakt tak baar main rahe hai
 He has deep roots in Indian society and probably has some contacts abroad
 'nyaayadhish ne kaha, ‘lekin vah pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh taur par gavaahon ko prabhavit nahin karenge, lekin uparokt tathyon ko dekhte hue is tathy se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 In addition, the investigation is in the advance stage
 lihaaja, yah adaalat unhen jamaanat dene ko taiyaar nahin he
 In relation to his escape abroad, the judge said that this was prevented by imposing conditions such as submission of passports, issuing look out notices and not going out of the country without the permission of the court (even through Nepal and Bhutan) can go
 unhone kaha, ‘record par is tarah kaa koi sakshya nahin laayaa gaya ki chidambaram ne bharat se bhaagane kii koshish kii he
 The judge agreed with the arguments of senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who is representing Chidambaram on the issue of escaping abroad, while dismissing the arguments of Solicitor General Tushar Mehta
 sabooton ke saath chhedchhad ke maamle par adaalat ne kaha ki maamle se sambandhit dastavej sibiai, sarkaar or adaalat ke paas hai
 The judge said, 'the petitioner is not in power except being a member of Parliament
 isliye mere vichaar se chidambaram dwaara sabooton ke saath chhedchhad kii koi ashanka nahin he
 ' film 'badlapur boij' kii kahani uttar pradesh ke chote se gaanv badlapur kii he, jahaan sookhe kii vajah se kisaanon kaa haal behaal he
 In such a situation, a farmer commits suicide to bring his voice to the Chief Minister to build a canal there
 badale main use pagal kaha jaataa he
 But his son does not give up and brings his voice to the Chief Minister through Kabaddi
 film 'badlapur boij' kaa vishay dil ko chune vaala he
 It shows how the poor farmer of the country is unable to convey his voice even to his government and leaders
 is kaaran ve apane upar hi julm kar daalate hai or aatmahatya kii taraf kadam badha lete hai
 Looking at the poster or promo of this film, one realizes that it is a film based on kabaddi, but it is not
 yah film sirf kabddi ko nahin dikhaati, balki kabddi ke parivesh main ek garib kisaan ke bete kii jaddojahad or uski koshishon kaa taana-bana buna gaya he
 Most of the faces in the film are new, but their acting suits their character
 kabddi ke coach ke role main annu kapur jame hai
 The film also has some drawbacks
 dramebaaji he, or bina matlab ke gane bhi, jo kahin naa kahin iske vishay ko bhatkaate najar aate hai
 In 'badlapur Boys' the subject is honest, but the film did not become as strong
 phir bhi yah dil ko chooti he, kyonki isamen gaanv kaa pyaar, gaanv main lagane vaale meley, kabddi kii ladaai, jalan or sabase khaas baat apni manzil ko chune kaa junun najar aata he
 The film's script may be weak, but the film has a dialogue, "the effort is big or small
 
 
 safal he yaa asafal
 
 
 This is determined by the determination and determination taken
 main bhi kah saktaa hum ki nirdeshak shailesh verma kaa is vishay par film banane kaa sankalp hi bada he
 So this film 2 from my side
 5 stars

 Famous South director Omar Lulu is going to do a blast again with his upcoming film Dhamaka
 umr lulu (omar Lulu) kii yah manoranjakfilm shaadi se jude ek sandesh par aadhaarit he
 But recently Omar Lulu's 'explosion' has become a problem for him
 darasal, 'dhamaakaa (dhamaka)' main kuch secondake liye tivi superhiro 'shaktimaan (shaktimaan)' kaa kirdaar dikhaaya janaa tha, jiske role main film ke abhinayta mukesh najar aane vaale the
 a glimpse of this was also shared by Omar Lulu on social media
 lekin yah bhoomika unki apamking film ke liye musiibat ban gai, kyonki khud 'shaktimaan' ke nirmaataa or abhinayta mukesh khanna (mukesh Khanna) ne umr lulu ko iske liye notice bhej diya
 Dear @iammukeshkhanna Sir, i was informed by FEFKA of your complaint about depicting Shaktimaan as one of the characters in my upcoming movie _dhamaka_
 i understand that you are the copyright holder of the character 'shaktimaan', his costume, theme music etc and i should not have tried to use it in my film without your permission
 i sincerely apologize for the oversight and any inconvenience this might have caused you
 Superhero references are popularly used in South Indian movies and so we inadvertently overlooked the copyright concerns
 We intend to give due credit to you in the title credits of the movie
 i would also like to clarify a small misunderstanding in your complaint about the film
 In my film _dhamaka_, the actor Mukesh does not actually play the character of Shaktimaan
 It is just a 10 second sequence in which a character visualizes Mukesh Sir (actor of DHAMAKA )as Shaktimaan for posessing extraordinary health and stamina for his elder age and that is the only part in the movie where the superhero appears
 My writers had originally thought of Superman and i could not help changing it to Shaktimaan because generations of Indians were inspired by Shakthimaan since its inception in DD1 and i am a proud member of that fandom
 Shakthimaan was one of my favourite superheros that made my childhood so exciting and i still cherish great love and adoration for your character
 Malayali's nostalgia is incomplete without the memories of Shaktimaan, the first Indian superhero of Television
 You motivated young minds to harness superpowers from their own selves and fight against injustice in society and we are immensely grateful to you
 i hope you would accept this humble apology
 i also hope this would bring to a close all the controversies in media surrounding this issue
 Sorry Shakthimaan
 Your faithful fan Omar lulua post shared by OMAR LULU (@omar_lulu_) on Sep 15, 2019 at 7:05am pdtumara lulu (omar Lulu) ne dhamaakaa ke liye 'shaktimaan (shaktimaan)' kaa kairactor mukesh khanna (mukesh Khanna) kii anumati liye bina hi prayog kiya tha
 However, after receiving the notice, Omar Lulu has also apologized on social media for this
 unhone apane instagram acount se mukesh khanna se maafee maangate hue likhaa, "main samaj saktaa hum ki aap 'shaktimaan', iske mujeec, costum or har cheez ke liye copirite holder hai or mujhe iskaa prayog aapaki anumati ke bina nahin karnaa chahie tha
 i apologize for the inconvenience caused to you
 dakshin bhartiya filmon main aksar superhiro kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, isliye hamaninjane main copirite ko andekha kiya
 So we will give you credit in the film as well
 "iske aage umr lulu (omar Lulu) ne ek or galatfahami ko dur karne ke liye likhaa, "main aapaki shikaayat main meri film ko lekar ek or galatfahami ko dur karnaa chaahunga
 In my film 'dhamaka', actor Mukesh is not playing the character of 'shaktimaan'
 yah keval 10 secondka sikvence he, jiske liye mukesh ko is kirdaar main taiyaar kiya gaya he
 My writers thought of Superman for the film, but the Indian generation is actually inspired by Shaktimaan, so i couldn't replace this character with anyone else

 Senior leaders have also issued a joint statement in this regard

 The statement said, 'to say that everyone is responsible for the defeat in Bihar means that no one is responsible for it
 yah dikhaata he ki wo jo bihar main jeetne par shrey lenge, haarane par bhaagenge
 What else in the joint statement - to say that everyone is responsible for the defeat in Bihar means that no one is responsible for it
 - yah dikhaata he ki wo jo bihar main jeetne par shrey lenge, haarane par bhaagenge
 - Responsibility should be fixed on the defeat in Bihar
 - yah bataata he dilli main haar ke baad bhi sabak nahin liya gaya
 Those responsible should not be reviewed for the defeat in Bihar
 - bihar main haar kii vajahon kii gambhirtha se samiksha honi chahie

 It is also important in the sense that the party which talks about sitting with the power of the center and taking all the people, people in its own party are angry with it
 maardarshak mandal or maargdarshankhaas baat yah bhi he ki adwani or joshi donon bijepi maardarshak mandal ke sadsy hai or kahin na kahin unki naaraazgi is baat ko lekar bhi he ki jo kuch ho rahaa he vah maargdarshan ke hisaab se chal nahin rahaa he
 Yashwant Sinha and Shanta Kumar are also senior, experienced and mature leaders of the party and for the first time the manner in which the four leaders have adopted sharp attitude especially after the party's defeat in Bihar, became a problem for the Prime Minister and the party president

 Regarding the violence during the Dalit movement, he said that which foreign agency did Rahul Gandhi use to set the country on fire? During this time, he also took a dig at all opposition parties coming with the Congress
 unhone twit kar kaha ki endie sarkaar neesti-essi(sanshodhan) vidheyak-2015 ko sansad se paarit karakar is kanoon ko majboot banaaya he or dalit va vanchit varg ke logon kaa jivan behatar banane ke liye kai yojanaayen lagu kii he, lekin sonia gandhi kii daavat udaane vaale 20 dalon ne supreme court ke aadesh kii aad main daliton ko gumraah kar bihar sahit desh ke 12 rajyon ko utpaat ke hawaale kar diya

 He targeted Lalu Yadav, saying that instead of apologizing for the deaths during the Dalit protests, Lalu Prasad closed his Twitter-tongue

 The government has also filed a reconsideration petition against this decision of the Supreme Court, but to organize violence in Bharat Bandh, a well-known rumor was spread that the Supreme Court is acting at the behest of the NDA government

 It is difficult to say anything about what the movement of Anna at jantar-mantar will take

 If this happens, there will be a second time within about 6 months when BSNL employees will be deprived of timely salary

 Please tell that the employees of BSNL get salary till the last of every month or the first working day of the next month
 kyon lag rahe hai kayaas?times of india kii report ke mutabik beasenel ne sarkaar se kaha he ki company ke paas kaamkaaj jari rakhane ke liye paise nahin hai
 According to the company, due to lack of cash, it is difficult to give salary of about Rs 850 crore for June
 beasenel ke korporate bajet and banking divijan ke senior general manager puuran chandra ne telecom mantralay main joint secratory ko likhe ek patr main kaha, 'har maheene ke revenue or kharchon main antar kii vajah se ab company kaa sanchaalan jari rakhana chintaa kaa vishay ban gaya he
 He further said that it has now reached a level where it would be almost impossible to continue operations of BSNL without adding sufficient equity
 'BSNL is halaat main kyon ?agar beasenel aaj in halaaton main he to iske peeche kai vajah hai
 The biggest reason is the company's expenditure on employees
 darasal, beasenel kaa kul aamadani kaa kareeb 55 fisadi karmchaariyon ke vetan par kharch hota he
 This budget increases by 8 percent every year
 aasaan bhashaa main samajhen to vetan par kharch lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he or aamadani main giravat aa rahi he

 Actually, BSNL wants to take loans from banks but the government argues that the company should meet its expenses by collecting money from its sources
 haalanki kuch media report main aisi khabaren chal rahi hai ki sarkaar beasenel ko sankat se ubaarane ke nae prastaav par vichaar kar rahi he
 Let us know that Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself took stock of the financial condition of BSNL 3 months ago and during this time the chairman of the company also gave a presentation to the PM
 13 saalon se ghate membsenel pichley 13 saalon se ghate main hai, lekin ghate ke apane aankade nahin de rahi he
 BSNL argues that since it is an unlisted company, it is not mandatory to publicize the data
 beasenel ke aankade tabhi saamne aae jab mantri ne sansad main prashnon ke jawaab die
 In the month of December 2018, the then Telecom Minister Manoj Sinha told the Parliament that the annual loss of BSNL increased to Rs 7,992 crore in the financial year 2017-18
 isse pehle 2016-17 main company kaa ghaataa 4,786 karod rupee rahaa
 Accordingly, there is a loss of Rs 3,206 crore in just 1 year

 Shah Rukh Khan's presence during the Kolkata Knight Riders match is very important for the team
 kolkata niterides ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari venki mysore ne somvaar ko kaha ki yah baliwood star bhale hi shaareerik rup se stadium main nahin ho lekin unki duaayen hameshaa saath rahengi
 The Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) has made it clear that Shah Rukh Khan will not be allowed to enter the Wankhede Stadium for his team's IPL match
 venki se yah poochne par ki shahrukh kii anupasthiti se team ke manobal par kya asar padegaa to venki kaa jawaab tha, 'vah shaareerik rup se nahin balki bhaavnaatmak rup se stadium main honge
 Venky said, "even though he may not be with us, his prayers will be with us
" unka hamaare saath protsaahan dena hameshaa hi acha rahata he lekin anya patibaddhtayen bhi hai
 On May 18 last year, Shah Rukh was banned for five years for entering the MCA campus, including the Wankhede Stadium
 keker kii mumbai indiens par jeet ke baad unki emsie ke suraksha staff or adhikariyon se jhadap ho gayi thi
 Shah Rukh, however, denied that he had misbehaved and said that he reacted only after the security staff scrambled with his children
 aaj ke hindu main rafaal deal kii file se do or panne baahar aa gaye hai
 This time the entire page is printed and the things that are there are quite terrible
 da hindu kii report ko hindi main bhi samajha ja saktaa he
 The government repeatedly says that there has been no corruption in the Rafale deal
 vahi sarkaar ek baar yah bhi bataa de ki rafaal deal kii sharton main bhrashtachar hone par karrwai ke praavdhaan ko kyon hataaya gaya? vah bhi pradhanmantri kii adhyakshata vaali raksha maamalon kii mantrimandaleey samiti kii baithak main ise hataaya gaya
 Have you heard of any defense purchase deal, the terms of which remove the provision of punishment from any agency or agent for taking commission or undue influence? The same has been done in the Modi government's most transparent deal
 modi ji bataa den ki kis dealer ko bachaane ke liye is shart ko hataaya gaya he?hindu akhbaar nipane pehle panne ke puure cover par vistaar se ise chapa he
 If everything was printed on a single day, then the government would have reacted at once
 ab use is par bhi pratikriya deni hogi
 What is the address then a new note is issued
 en ram ne jab8farvari ko note kaa aadha panna chapa to sarkaar ne puraa panna jari karvaa diya
 Only half a page was confirmed with that
 lekin ab jo note jari hua he vah usase bhi bhayankar he or ise padhane ke baad samaj aata he ki kyon adhikari pradhanmantra karyaalay ke samanaantar rup se dakhal dene ko lekar chintit the
 Citing the terms of the defense procurement process, n Ram has written that this rule, made in 2013, was to be applied to every defense purchase
 ek standard prakriya apanaai gai thi ki koi bhi deal ho isamen chhot nahin di ja sakati
 But the Indian government gave unprecedented concessions to two French companies, Dasso and MBDA France
 raksha mantralay ke vittiya adhikari is baat par jor dete rahe ki paisa sidhe companiyon ke haath main nahin janaa chahie
 It was suggested that escrow accounts should be created instead of giving money directly to companies
 usamen paise rakhe jaaen
 This account belongs to the French government and it should be paid only when Dasso and MBDA supply France fulfilling all the conditions
 yah praavdhaan bhi hataa diya gaya
 Why was this done? kya yah paardarshee tarika he?sidhe france kii companiyon ko paisa dene or use unki sarkaar kii nigehabaani se mukt kar dena,kahaan kii paardarshita he
 n Ram has written that it seems that the government has hidden these things from the Supreme Court
 kya sarkaar ne supreme court ko bataaya he ki is deal main rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar or pradhanmantri karyaalay kii bhi bhoomika rahi he?is sawaal kaa jawaab sarkaar se aa saktaa he yaa phir supreme court se
 N
 Ram says that it is not easy to remove these conditions without pressure from above
 bevajaah prabhaav daalane par sazaa kaa praavdhaan to isiilie rakhaa jaataa hoga ki koi kareed prakriya main duusare channel se shaamil na ho jaae or theka na le le
 On finding out the agent and the agency, the provision of punishment would have been kept so that there is no scope for commission
 ab aap hindi main sochen,kya yah samajhnaa vaaki itnaa mushkil he ki in sharton ko hataane ke peeche kya manshaa rahi hogi? 23sitambar2016ko dilli main bharat or france ke bich qaraar hua tha
 According to this, Dattar will supply Rafale aircraft and MBDA France will provide a package of weapons to the Indian Air Force
 isi maheene main parrikar kii adhyakshata main raksha kareed parishad kii baithak hui thi
 In this meeting, eight conditions related to purchase were changed
 inamen afaset kantrect or supplai protocol bhi shaamil hai
 There was a controversy over the offset contract as questions arose over Anil Ambani's company getting a contract to build defense equipment
 24agast2016ko pehle pradhanmantri kii adhyakshata main raksha kii mantrimandaleey samiti ne manzuri de di thi
 The removal of the provision of punishment from agents, agency, commission and undue influence on the deal opened the way for direct business from commercial suppliers who were
 is baat ko lekar bhartiya baatcheet dal ke em pi singh,e aar sule or rajeev verma ne asahmati darj karai thi
 From the documents that The Hindu has, it seems that these three have lodged a very strong objection
 do companiyon ke saath sidhe deal karne vaali baat par note main likhte hai ki kareed do sarkaron ke str par ho rahi he
 Then how can the French government entrust the responsibility of supplying equipment, industrial services to France's industrial suppliers
 yani phir sarkaron ke str par deal kaa matlab hi kya rah jaataa he jab sarkaar kii koi zimmedaari nahin rah jaati he
 The three officials also object that the money was to be given to the French government for the purchase
 ab france kii companiyon ko sidhe diya jayega
 It would not be appropriate to compromise the basic conditions of financial integrity
 ab aap hindi main sochen
 Three top officials of the Ministry of Defense are writing that it would not be appropriate to compromise the basic conditions of financial integrity
 ve kyon aisa likh rahe the? aakhir sarkaar france kii donon companiyon ko bhrashtachar kii sthiti main karrwai se kyon bachaa rahi thi?ab modi ji hi bataa sakate hai ki bhrashtachar hone par sazaa na dene kii meharbaani unhone kyon kii
 For whom do dephence saplir ke liye kyon kii ye meharbaani
 N
 Ram now comes to the point that this kindness should be seen in connection with why the Government of India did not ask any guarantee from the Government of France for this deal of seventy eighty thousand crores
 aap bhi koi deal karenge to chahenge ki paisa na duube
 There is a guarantor in between
 makaan karidate samay bhi aap aisa karte hai
 Here, the officials of the Ministry of Defense are saying to take bank guarantee, take sovereign guarantee from the government, but the Government of India says that no we will not take any guarantee
 ye meharbaani kiske liye ho rahi thi?en ram ne likhaa he ki iske badale sarkaar letters of conform par maan jaati he jisaki koi kanoon haisiyat nahin hoti he
 It says in it that the French government will take appropriate steps if there are problems in supply
 yah letters aaf confort bhi der se aayaa
 It was proposed to take the guarantee till the meeting of the Cabinet Committee of 24 August 2016
 yahi ki france kii sarkaar ke paas ek khaataa ho jise escro acount kehete hai
 Through that, whenever the work is done, the supply will be given to those two companies
 companiyaan bhi is bharose kaam karengi ki maal kii supplai ke baad paisa milegaa hi kyonki vah usee kii sarkaar ke khate main he
 But Director of the Ministry of Defense, Purchase Smita Nagaraj sends a proposal to remove it and gets the approval
 pradhanmantri ne ise manzuri kyon di?ab aap yahaan8farvari ko chhapi en ram kii report ko yaad kiijie
 It was in that report that on 24 November 2015, three top Defense Ministry officials objected that the Prime Minister's Office has entered into this deal independently without our knowledge
 jisase hamaari team kii molbhav kii kshamta kamazor ho jaati he
 Defense Secretary G
 Mohan Kumar also agrees and sends the file to the Defense Minister
 or kehete hai ki fih uchit hoga ki pradhanmantri karyaalay isse dur rahe
 The Defense Minister signs this note after about one and a half months
 11janvari2016ko
 The Defense Minister himself takes one and a half months to sign the file
 lekin raksha mantralay main vittiya salaahkaar sudhanshu mohanti ko file dekhne kaa paryaapt samay bhi nahin diya jaataa he
 On 14 January 2016, Sudhanshi Mohanty writes in note-263 that i wish i would have had enough time to look at the entire file and consider many issues
 phir bhi chunki file turant raksha mantri ko saunpi jaani he main vittiya nazar se kuch twarit tippaniyan karnaa chahta hum
 Mohanty writes that if a bank guarantee or sovereign guarantee is not in place then at least one escrow account should be opened through which the companies are given money
 isse supplai puri karaane kii naitik zimmedaari france kii sarkaar kii ho jaaegi
 Since the French government is also a party to this deal and is jointly responsible for the supply, it should not object to such an account
 mohanti apane note main sarkaar or company ke bich vivaad hone par kaise nipataara hoga,us par jo sahmati ban chuki thi,use hataane par bhi etraz darj kiya gaya he
 The Law Ministry also stressed the need for bank guarantees and sovereign guarantees
 raksha mantralay ko bheje gaye apane note main
 Now think for yourself and think in Hindi
 koi bhi kathith rup se eemaandaar sarkaar kisi saude se bhrashtachar kii sambhaavna par karrwai karne kaa praavdhaan kyon hataayegi?bina guarantee ke sattar assi hazaar karod kaa sauda kyon karegi?kya bhrashtachar hone par sazaa ke praavdhaanon ko hataanaa paardarshita he?aap jab in sawaalon par sochenge to jawaab mil jayega
 Sitaram Yechury, the general secretary of the Communist Party of india-marxist (CPI-M), said on Friday that Pakistan wants Narendra Modi to remain the Prime Minister so that Hindu communalism in India grows and this reinforces Muslim conservatism
 pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ne islamabad main videshi patrakaron ko bharat main loksabhaa chunaav shuru hone se ek din pehle kaha tha ki agar bharat main bijepi chunaav jitati he to shantivaarta karne or kashmir mudde ko sulajhane ke liye behatar avasar uplabdh honge

 So who is the friend of Pakistan and who is the enemy? Modi says in his election campaign that Pakistan is afraid of him
 ' yechuri ne modi or pakistan sarkaar ke bich gathjod kaa sanket dete hue kaha 'sachai yah he ki pakistan modi ko pradhanmantri banate dekhnaa chahta he kyonki iske peeche tark yah he ki bharat main hindu sampradayikta bade or pakistan main muslim rudhivadita majboot ho taaki yah donon ek-duusare kaa poshan kar sake
 Yechury was talking to reporters in Kolkata at the party office
 unhone kaha ki yahi sthiti pashchim bengal main he
 He said that there is an alliance between the Trinamool Congress and the BJP in the state

 But cannot take action against his wife

 Its complaint is not made in any police station but is made in front of the magistrate and all the evidence has to be produced
 saboot paryaapt hone par sambandhit vyakti ko saman bheja jaataa he or cese chalaaya jaataa he
 What are the objections? It is argued against this law that a crime involving two men, both women and men, in which convicting only men is sex discrimination
 iske alaava mahila ke pati ko hi shikaayat kaa haq hona kahin na kahin mahila ko pati kii sampatti jaisaa darshata he, kyonki pati ke alaava mahila kaa koi anya rishtedaar is maamle main shikayatakarta nahin ho saktaa

 raipur main ames khulne ke baad sirf chhattisgarh hi nahin balki simavarti rajya jharkhand, odisha, uttar pradesh, madhya pradesh or maharashtr ke bhi marij yahaan ilaaj ke liye aate hai
 In such a situation, the presence of doctors in this institute and the environment here is very important
 ames management ko is par gaur karnaa hoga
 It is also being told that the future of private hospitals was in danger due to good treatment of patients in AIIMS

 Polling for the Lok Sabha elections 2019 in Karnataka is scheduled in two phases on April 18 and 23
 janata kaa samarthan hasil karne ke liye raajnneetik dal edi chotii kaa jor laga rahe hai
 The parties are busy campaigning
 bhartiya janata party ko centre kii satta se bedakhal karne ke liye karnataka main congress or jedies gathbandhan main chunaav lard rahi hai
 Both the parties have fielded a joint candidate for the North Bangalore seat
 krishna byre gauda congress ke pratyaashee ke taur par maidan main hai vahiin bijepi ne kendriya mantri sadanand gauda ko apana pratyaashee banaaya he
 It is clear that there is a direct fight between Congress and BJP on this seat
 bengalooru uttar loksabhaa seat karnataka rajya kii ahm seat he
 This seat is the largest in the state and the third largest Lok Sabha seat in the country
 is seat par philhal bijepi kaa kabja he or soobe ke purv mukhyamantri sadanand gauda yahaan se saansad hai
 The Janata dal-secular (JD-S) is supporting the Congress candidate instead of fielding its candidate for the Bangalore North seat
 donon partiyon ke bich seat samjhaute kii vyavastha ke tahat, congress yahaan se 20 siton ke badale 21 loksabhaa siton or jedies aath ke badale saat siton par chunaav ladegi
 Meanwhile, Karnataka's Rural Development Minister Krishna Byre Gowda responded to his critics by saying that he was not 'frantically contesting elections'
 bengalooru uttar se congress ke tikat par chunaav lard rahe byre gauda par unke aalochak beman se chunaav main utarane kaa aarope laga rahe hai
 Byre Gowda said, BJP is expert in creating stories that i am contesting elections with reluctance, who do not want to win
 main is tarah ke bayaan ko apmaan maanata hum kyonki nautanki karne ke liye chunaav ladanaa khud ko dhokhaa dena he
 In fact, the perception of a reluctant candidate was formed when the Bangalore North seat was initially allotted to the JDS under the seat-sharing agreement
 baharhaal, jadies ne ise congress ko uphaar main de diya jise shuru main upyukt ummidavaar nahin mili or phir usne mantri byre gauda ko maidan main utaara
 It is noteworthy that in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, like most seats in the country, the BJP won the Bangalore North seat
 bijepi ke sadanand gauda ko yahaan kii janata ne 2014 main vijayi banaaya
 He gave nearly 2 to C
 Narayanasamy of Congress
 3 lakh voton se haraaya or centre main mantri pad bhi hasil kiya
 More than 7 lakh votes were cast in favor of Gowda while the Congress 4 here
 88 lakh voton par simat gai
 JDS, Aam Aadmi Party and BSP stood at the third, fourth and fifth positions respectively
 is chunaav main voting pratishat 56 ke kareeb rahaa tha
 Of the 8 Lok Sabha seats under this Lok Sabha, the Congress is in control of 5
 is lihaaj se bijepi ke liye phir se yahaan jeet darj karnaa mushkil hoga, kyonki soobe main philhal congress-jedies ke gathbandhan kii sarkaar he
 For a long time, the voters here have relied on the Congress, but the voting pattern has changed since the last three elections
 baharhaal, is seat ko purv main alag-alag naamon se janaa jaataa rahaa he
 In the elections of 1957 to 1962, this seat was known as Bengaluru city whereas earlier it was named as Bengaluru North
 is seat par 1951 main hue pehle chunaav main congress ke keshav linger ko jeet mili thi
 From then until the year 1996, for 45 years, the Congress continued to win this seat
 pehali baar 1996 main janata dal ke si narayansami ne bengalooru uttar seat par jeet darj kii
 After this, the bjp's account started opening here and in 2004, HT Sangliana of BJP won
 2009 main bijepi ke di bi chandra gauda or 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi ke sadanand gauda yahaan se saansad chune gaye

 worne ne 4 june 1993 main england ke khilaaf manchester test main english ballebaaj mike gating ko bold kiya
 The ball was rotated at an angle of about 90 degrees
 worne kii gend leg stump ke kaaphi baahar pich hui or aisa lag rahaa tha ki gend wide ho sakati he, isi ke chalate gaiting ne use khilne kaa prayaas nahin kiya
 Meanwhile, a very fast turn ball dodged Gatting and went to his off stump, which surprised everyone
 dilli main sarkarbanane ke bare main kaaphi samay se chali aa rahi anischitata aakhirkaar khatm ho gai he
 Lt
 Governor Najeeb Jung has also completed the formalities of seeking opinion from all parties
 ab yah baat saaf ho gai he ki bijepiyaha sarkaar nahibanaayegi or jaahir haiaise main chunaav honge
 This is the logical culmination of this entire episode
 dilli main koi bhi party sarkaar banane ke kareeb nahin he or aisa karne ke liye vipakshi dalon ke vidhayak tode jate yaa kharid-bikri hoti
 Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal has been consistently accusing BJP of buying and selling mlas
 lekin unke aaropon main kitna dam he yah ab saaf ho gaya he
 Now his demand that general elections should be held in Delhi seems to be fulfilled
 ab yah bhi dekhnaa he ki unke is daawey main kitna dam he ki unki party chunaav main bahumat paa legi
 On the other hand, the looted Congress in the state also wants elections
 unke liye yah ek mauka he ki vah rajdhani kii janata kaa phir se vishwaas maange
 However, he does not seem to get anything like this
 sach to yah he ki congress zyada se zyada apni siton main kuch badhotaree kii ummid kar sakati he
 In the neighboring state of Haryana, there is no hope that the party's sweep will be clear
 baharhaal mudda yah he ki bijepi ne jod-tod kar sarkaar na banane kaa faisla kiya he jo uske liye hitkar he
 PM Narendra Modi has neither done nor allowed to do any such work during his rule, which will undermine the credibility of him and the party
 agar dilli main jod-tod yaa kharid bikri ke jariye sarkaar banati to unki saakh par dhabba lagata
 His and the party's confidence is on the seventh sky
 aise main yah faisla koi hairaan karne vaala nahin he
 This would make it easier for the party to maintain its image and get rid of a dirty politics that it would fall prey to
 narendra modi ke liye yah samay apni or party kii chhavi banane kaa he or dilli jaise chote se rajya main jod-tod se sarkaar banaakar vah ise khona nahin chahenge
 It is also a right decision for democracy because it is a sign of a healthy practice
 dilli main phir se chunaav hone hi chahie or bijepi ne sahi kadam uthaaya he
 This will put an end to all controversies
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne ek mahatvapurn faisle main kaha he ki sadak durghatana main maare gayi vyakti ke ashriton ko muaavje kaa aadesh dete samay mritak kii ‘bhavi sambhaavnaaon’ par vichaar kiya jaayegaa
 The court has laid down the standard basis for determining compensation in such claims
 supreme court kii paanch jajon kii samvidhan peeth ne apane faisle main kaha, sadak durghatnaon main maare yaa ghayal hone vaale khud kaa kaarobaar karne vaale yaa jinaki tay aamadani ho, unhen muaavje dete vakt uski aamadani ke saath-saath bhavishya kii sambhaavnaaon par bhi vichaar kiya jayega
 The Supreme Court approved this principle of compensation
 chif justise deepak mishra kii adhyakshata vaali paanch sadasyeey samvidhan peeth ne kaha he ki vaise to maut kaa vikalp paisa nahin ho saktaa lekin muaavje main ek samanta to honi hi chahie
 The bench has said that it is necessary to have a balance between these two
 sadak durghatana peediton ko milane vaale muaavje main ekasmanta honi hi chahie
 The Constitution Bench has said that before deciding the amount of compensation to be given to the victims of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, it is necessary to keep in mind that it is logical and consistent with the principle of equality
 peeth ne kaha he ki durghatana main maare gaye vyakti kii aayu 40 saal se kam ho to mritak ke vetan kaa 50 fisadi bhavishya kii kamai kii sambhaavnaaon ke taur par milanaa chahie
 At the same time, it should be 30 percent for the dead between 40 and 50 years, while it should be 15 percent for the dead between 50 and 60 years of age
 tippaniyan The constitution bench has said that if the deceased has his own business or has a fixed income (excluding tax) and is under 40 years of age, then what he was earning at the time would get 40% additional compensation
 vahiin 40 se 50 varsh ke bich vaale logon ke liye yah 25 fisadi or 50 se 60 varsh ke bich vaale mritkon ke liye yah 10fisadi hoga
 The Constitution Bench has given this decision, noting that in many of the old orders, compensation has been 'varying' between the compensation received by the road accident victims
 saath hi peeth ne sampada ke nuksaan par 15 hajaar rupee, company ke nuksaan ke mad main 40 hajaar rupee or antim sanskaar ke liye 15 hajaar rupee dene ke liye kaha he
 These amounts will increase by 10% every three years
 peeth ne kaha ki adaalat or tribunel ko muaavje kii rakam tay karte vakt vyaavhaarik ravaiya apnaanaa chahie jo vaastaviktaa ke kareeb ho

 donon milakar desh main behtareen pradarshan karne vaale khilaadiyon ko scolership or award dekar sammanit karenge
 This scholarship will be given by Virat Kohli Foundation (VKF) and RP Sanjeev Goenka Group
 wikeef is pahal main salanaa do karod rupee kii madad degaa

 lekin, unhen ek manch chahie, pahchaan chahie
 They need facilities

 "virat said that his foundation will help two crore rupees every year, but this help may increase in the coming days
 viraat ne apane aap ko is award ko paane vaale khilaadiyon kii suchi se dur rakhaa he
 Indian badminton coach Pullela Gopichand was also present on the occasion along with Virat and Sanjeev

 This initiative is not just for cricket but for all sports

 "gopichand, who elevated India's name in badminton, is also associated with this first
 unka maananaa he ki yuva khilaadi khel ko kariyar ke taur par len, is lihaaj se yah ek jaruri kadam he
 Gopichand said, "virat and Sanjeev, these two names were enough for me to join this initiative
 is tarah ke aword khilaadiyon ko prerana dete hai
 This initiative will help players to take up the sport as a career
 ummid he ki ham sab milakar aisa kuch kar paaenge jisase is desh main khelon or khilaadiyon ko phayda hoga
 "the Sports Journalists Association of India (SJFI) will play an important role in the award selection process and will give its suggestions
 esageefai is samay khilaadiyon ke pradarshan kii samiksha kar rahaa he
 This year this award will be given on 11 November in Mumbai
 alag-alag khelon main se acha pradarshan karne vaale khilaadiyon ko chunaa jayega or puraskrit kiya jayega
 In Chhattisgarh, crop insurance companies have played such a tactic in many areas that farmers have become irritated
 beemaa companiyon ne fasal beemaa kii baqayada premium kii rakam vasuuli, lekin jab baari nuksaan ke bharpai kii ai, to beemaa companiyon ne pallaa jhaad liya
 Somewhere, due to drought, excessive water fall, and other thunderstorms damaged farmers' crops
 kisaanon ne fasal beemaa kii rakam kii adaayagi ke liye jab agriculture sosayadi kaa darwaja khatkhataya tab pataa chalaa ki nuksaan kii bharpai karne kii bajaae beemaa companiyon ne premium kii rakam hi lautaa di
 False farmers are pleading for justice due to crop insurance
 rajya ke kai jilon main beemaa companiyon ne kisaanon ko jhatka diya he
 Thousands of farmers in the village of Pirid in Balod district of Chhattisgarh are in trouble, instead of compensating for the loss
 ye kisaan fasal beemaa kii rakam ko paane ke liye do saal se edi chotii kaa jor laga rahe hai
 But there is no one to listen to his pleas
 in kisaanon ne apane kheton main chaaval or daal kii fasal lagaai thi
 He was also insured, but the standing crop was destroyed in a single day due to cyclonic storm
 is gaanv ke kareeb chaar sau kisaanon kii haalat us samay patali ho gai, jab fasal beemaa kii rakam kii maang ko lekar ve sosayadi pahunche
 The officers of the society returned him saying that the insurance companies had returned his premium amount
 aise main unhen muaavja koun de
 Farmers paid crop insurance installments throughout the year
 ab ye kisaan nuksaan kii bharpai ko lekar sarkari daftaron ke chakkar kaat rahe hai, lekin fasal beemaa karne vaali companiyon kii sehat par koi asar nahin padaa
 It is being told that most insurance companies are proving to be laggards on the scale of compensation
 ve fasal beemaa ke muaavje kaa agar shatpratishat bhugtan karengi to unhen khud ke dub jane kaa khatra he
 So they are ignoring the loss
 fasal beemaa karne vaali companiyon kii fehrist main kai nami companiyaan hai, jo musiibat main logon kii sahaayta kaa daawa kar rojaanaa apana kaarobaar badha rahi hai
 In many areas, farmers are troubled, not only Balod, Durg, Bemetara, Kawardha, Dhamtari, Mahasamund district, and many other areas where crop insurance companies have returned the premium amount only when the opportunity arises
 premium kii rakam lautaa dene se maamla kanoonee pench main funs gaya he
 Farmers are sometimes looking at the society or sometimes at the collector's office
 taaki aisi companiyon ke khilaaf koi to karrwai ho sake, lekin unke haath kuch nahin aayaa
 State Agriculture Minister Brijmohan Agrawal has his own arguments on this matter
 unka kahana he ki tamaam maamalon kii shikaayatein jab unke saamne aaengi to wo jarur gaur farmaayenge
 However, complaints are still on the officers' table
 jila colector or sab diviginal magistrate ke alaava rajasav nyaayalay main vibhinn beemaa companiyon kii lagbhag paune chaar lakh shikaayatein hai
 Most of this is to compensate for the loss of crop insurance scheme
 kisaanon ke khet khalihaanon kaa survey karne ke baad zyaadaatar beemaa companiyon ne unhen muaavja dene ke maamle main haath peeche khinch liye
 Claim objection is being heard in many cases
 apane vakeelon ke madhyam se zyaadaatar maamalon main beemaa companiyon ne kanoonee daanv-pench khelaa he or kisaanon kii premium kii rakam pichley daravaaje se sahakaari samitiyon ko saunp di he, taaki muaavje kii naubat hi naa aae
 His maneuver is teasing the government guidelines
 beemaa companiyon or sarkaar ke qaraar par sawalkendre se lekar rajya sarkaar tak fasal beemaa yojana kaa gungan karne main koi kasar baaki nahin chhodti hai, lekin jab is tarah ke halaat paidaa ho jate hai, tab kisaanon kii ore rukh karne kaa samay tak unke paas nahin hota
 The agreement between the state and central governments and insurance companies for crop insurance scheme is now under question mark

 Recently got a glimpse of it at Delhi Airport
 sutron kii maane to film kii pramotion ke liye dilli pahunchi puri cast airport se baahar nikal hi rahi thi ki ek ladki bhaagate hue film ke lead divyendu sharma ke paas ai or naaraazgi jataate hue kehane lagi ki is film se vah unki image kharaab kar rahe hai
 In the complaining tone, the girl also said that she was guilty of how much disrespect the other girls of Delhi would bring
 People will hesitate to add a relationship with them
 khabar he ki gusse main aakar lagaataar bolti ja rahi us ladki kii puri baaten na sirf divyendu ne sunin balki use yah bhi samajhaayaa ki is film ke jariye dilli kii ladakiyon kii bajaae un ladakon ko nishane par liya gaya he jo ladakiyon ko iji target samajhate hai
 When he was talked to Divyendu in this regard, he said, "believe me, through the film 'delhiwali Zalim Girlfriend' we have not tried to prove Delhi girls anywhere but i have always been saying that nowadays The boys are the only ones for whom girls have to adopt this attitude
 yahi baat maine us ladki ko bhi samajhaaii
 It is worth noting that apart from Divyendu, director Japinder and Premchi Mishraka, who is playing the role of 'jalim Girlfriend' in the film, also believe that every practical girl is a bloodthirsty and such bloodthirsty girlfriends are not only in Delhi
 nirmaataa manajit cor tathaa taranprit singh ke nirmaan tathaa japinder cor ke nirdesan main baniin film‘dilliwaali jaalim garlfriend’ke mukhya kalakaar divyendu sharma, ira dube, jaiki shroff, praachi mishra or pradhyumna singh he
 The film will be released on 20 March
 bollywood star shahid kapur or kiyaara adwani starer film kabir singh box offis par jabardast bijness kar rahi he
 On the one hand, while the film is doing amazing business, on the other hand, the series of evils on the film continues

 "in her next tweet, Rangoli wrote," Every time her boyfriend slept with another girl, notice that she didn't say anything to him
 wo raja betaa he lekin wo mahilaon ke sir par bottlen todta he
 Those women are hospitalized and all the cases come to Saifina's head

 In this sequence, now the Bihar government has plans to construct roads in any village from Patna, the capital, in just six hours
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kaha ki rajdhani patna se anya jila mukhyalayon main chah ghante ke bheetar pahunchane ke liye sadak nirmaan ke lakshya ko praapt karne ke baad ab unki sarkaar kii patna se kisi bhi gaanvon main chah ghante ke bheetar pahunchane vaali gunvattta vaali sadak ke nirmaan kii yojana he

 We have achieved this goal
 ab samay ko bhi ghataana chaahate hai
 He took a dig at the previous RJD rule, saying that there was a time when people used to say that there is a pit in the road or the road in the pit does not make sense
 nitish ne kaha ki padosi rajyon uttar pradesh or jharkhand se sote hue koi yatri aata tha or jatke se agar neend khul gayi to samajhataa tha ki bihar kii seemaa main aa gaye hai
 He said that we have made the state highway, district road
 saath hi 997 karod rupee kii laagat se rajya bajet se rashtriya rajmargon ko bhi marammat karaayi, jo raashi abhi tak centre se nahin mila he or ise ham hasil kiye bina nahin chodenge
 Nitish said that some people of Madhubani district who came to meet him told that they were talking about the road when they were going to Tirupati and Balaji
 gaadi ke chaalak ne kaha ki agar sadak acchhee dekhnaa he to bihar chale jaaiye jo is pradesh ke liye gaurav kii baat he
 Nitish said that Mukhyamantri Gram Sadak Yojana has been implemented in the state
 is yojana ke antargat 250 tak kii aabaadi vaale basaavat ko pakki sadakon se joda jaayegaa
 He said that in the matter of roads, his government has formulated results-based policy under which the road construction agency will maintain the road of the road construction department

 76 road ambulances will be employed for the maintenance of the road
 unhone kaha ki pulon kaa bhi rakrakhaav kiya jaayegaa tathaa pul kii nirantar marammat kii jaayegi taaki pul kii aayu bade
 The Chief Minister said that during the last RJD regime, where the annual budget of the state used to be four thousand crore rupees, it has now increased to 34 thousand crore rupees
 agle saal yojana bajet kaa lakshya 40 hajaar karod rupee kaa rakhaa gaya he
 mps Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh and Maheshwar Hazari, along with many other mlas and other dignitaries were present on the occasion

 An advisor who played a key role in preparing the bjp's manifesto said, "our foreign policy will be economy based
 makasad hoga ki arthvyavastha ko itnaa majboot bana liya jaae ki padosi deshon se aap apni sharton par deal kar saken
 "will there be a balance of power and peace? According to the advisors, Modi as Prime Minister will work towards protecting India's security interests and to balance the trade relations with China
" modi ne kabhi apni videsh niti kaa spasht khaakaa pesh nahin kiya lekin vah 1998 main parmaanu pareekshan karne vaale purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kii nitiyon kii kai baar prashansa kar chuke hai
 Atal spoke of a foreign policy based on 'power and peace'
 seemaa par milegaa karaara jawaab?modi ke salaahkaar ne kaha, 'china ab samaj jayega ki nae pradhanmantri darpok nahin hone vaale hai or ve koi harakat nahin karenge
 'BJP is strengthening the navy of the country and advocates a crafty response to border violations

 Effect of withdrawal of army from Afghanistan? One of the advisors said, “you and the nationalist approach will be looked at on issues like terrorism

 rajdhani dilli ke pramukh bazaaron kii association ne band se apane kadam peeche khinch liye hai
 In such a situation, the market closed on June 30 in protest against GST may be a flop in Delhi

 Traders said that they have reservations about some GST points but that does not mean that they will support the market shutdown
 dilli ke bade holcel bazaaron main se ek sadar bazaar market association ke mahasachiv devraj baweja kaa kahana he ki rojaanaa kii tarah sadar bazaar 30 june ko bhi khulaa rahegaa
 They do not support any kind of bandh

 Disappointed as a 'match fixer', former New Zealand all-rounder Chris Cairns has said that he is in a 'strange and frightening' situation and that he was presented to the International Cricket Council (ICC) by Brandon mccullum and Lou Vincent Took him to take his name in testimony
 landan metropolitan police dwaara poochtacha ke baad desh waapas laute kris kerns ne doharaaya ki un par brandan mackulam ko phixing ring main hissaa banane kii peshkash kiye jane kaa aarope sach nahin he
 43-year-old Chris Cairns revealed that three former New Zealand players - former captain Stephen Fleming, Daniel Vettori and Kayle Mills - have also made statements to the ICC on the matter, but not all of them have named him
 landan main kris kerns ko kisi bhi dandaneey aparaadh ke liye aropit nahin kiya gaya he, lekin unhen bataaya gaya ki brandan mackulam ne unke khilaaf gavaahi di he or daawa kiya gaya he ki is olerounder ne march 2008 main indian premier lig (ipel) ke pehle sanskaran dauraan unase peshkash kii thi
 Chris Cairns read his statement after arriving here, saying, "some people may have claimed anything in the media, three years before Brandon mccullum reported this alleged offer to an ICC anti-corruption official looked forward to
 
 
 '' "this is a misleading statement," Chris Cairns said, referring to the defamation case filed against the former IPL commissioner
 
 
 mackulam ne pehle apane aarope 17 farvari, 2011 ko isisi kii asiesu ikai ko bataae
 
 
 This was not only about three years after the alleged offer, but also in March 2012, 13 months before the London High Court hearing of the match fixing against Mary Lalit Modi
 
 
 '' kerns ne daawa kiya ki unke khilaaf lagaae gaye aarope nyaayalay ke saamne pehle hi sabit ho chuke hai
 He said, "at the hearing, every allegation that i was fixing the match appeared to be false
" 
 
 yah ajeeb he ki mackulam ne farvari, 2011 main isisi eessiu ko bataaya ki teen saal pehle maine use match fiks karne ke liye peshkash kii thi, lekin phir bhi na to usne or na hi eessiu bhrashtachar adhikari, jisane uskaa bayaan darj kiya tha, ne yah soochna isisi ko di or modi yaa kisi anya ko is khulaase se avgat karaayaa
 
 
 '' kris kerns ne kaha ki fleming, vittori or mills ne kisi bhi bayaan main unka naam nahin liya he
 He said, "these three players have not made any indirect allegations against me
 
 
 '' kerns ne vincent kii bhi aalochana kii, jiske saath vah baagi lig isiel main khele the
 Cairns insisted that he did not fix a single match in his career
 madhya gujarat ke adivasee ilaake main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne vishwa kii sabase oonchi stachu of unity kaa nirmaan karavaaya or is baat ko sabit kiya ki wo jis kaam kaa shilanyas karte hai wo use puraa jarur karte hai
 However, at the time of the formation of the Statue of Unity, the BJP government of Gujarat had made many promises to the people of the tribal community here, which were not fulfilled
 is vajah se adivasee samudaay ke logon ke jariye stachu of unity ko jab raashtra ke naam par samarpit kiya gaya tab uskaa sthaneey logon ne virodh bhi kiya tha
 The same protest is against the BJP in the minds of tribals today
 darasal us vakt kareeb 100 adivaasiyon par cese kiye gaye the or andolan ko dabaa diya gaya tha
 This can be directly seen in this small Udaipur Lok Sabha seat dominated by tribals
 vahiin, stachu of unity in adivasee kisaanon ko bijepi ke adhure vaadon kii yaad dilaa rahaa he
 It was announced by the government to give a second land to the farmers in front of the land they had taken, but the land has not yet been available to the farmers
 sardaar sarovar baandh kii vajah se kai adivasee kisaanon ko yahaan se visthapit kiya gaya tha
 They are still adamant about their demand
 khud kii jameen ko waapas paane ke liye kisaan baar-baar kalekater ke paas apni maang lekar pahunche, lekin sthaneey netaaon se kisi bhi tarah kii koi madad na milane kii vajah se adivaasiyon kaa gussa sarkaar ke saath saath sthaneey netaaon ke khilaaf bhi he
 Along with this, at the time when the Statue of Unity was being built, the tribals were promised that the tribal youth would be given employment in the places that would be created after its creation
 yah vaada bhi baad main puraa nahin hua or sara kaam agency ko diya gaya or agency ne adivaasiyon ko nahin balki bahari logon ko kaam diya
 Due to this also the tribals are very angry with the government
 gujarat sarkaar ne The Provisions of the Panchayats ACT 1996 ke kanoon kaa sakhti se paalan nahin kiya
 Under this, gram sabha cannot be strictly enforced
 gram sabha ke tahat samskruti, samudaay, adivasee reeti rivaaj ke tahat jo faisla liya jaataa he wo sthaneey prashasan ko maananaa padataa he
 This rule is also not being followed through local administration
 saath hi stachu of unity kii aay kaa 25 pratishat hissaa gram sabha ko dene kaa faisla bhi isi ke jariye kiya gaya tha
 Whichever administration is not following
 is puri jagah ko tourism ke taur par viksit karne kaa project ke tahat yahaan helicopter sarvice bhi shuru kii gai
 Constantly the sound of chopper keeps coming in the schools of the surrounding 7 villages
 iske chalate skool ke bachche padhai nahin kar pate hai
 Not only this, in order to develop this entire place and develop tourism here, the government had put different projects here
 isamen kareeb 72 gaanvon kii jameen kaa adhigrahan hona he
 There is still a lot of anger among the tribal people
 vahiin adivaasiyon kaa tadvi samaaj is baar bhaajapa se kaaphi naaraaz he, tadvi samaaj shuru se bhaajapa ke saath hi rahaa he
 But when tribal movement was done, cases were registered against about 100 people of Tadvi society
 chota udaipur ke aasapaas ke ilaake main bade paimaane par tadvi samaaj basataa he
 Apart from Tadvi, the Rathwa society also resides here on a large scale
 jabaki is baar bijepi or congress donon hi partiyon ne rathva samaaj ke netaa ko tikat diya he
 Because of this, there can be a split of votes between the two
 congress ne apni pehali hi list main chota udaipur ke ranjit rathva ko tikat diya tha
 Because of this, they have got a lot of time in campaigning
 jabaki bhaajapa ke maujuuda saasand ramsingh rathva ke saamne kaaphi virodh tha
 Due to which BJP has announced the name of Geetaben Rathwa on the last day of filing nomination
 ramsingh rathva ke virodh kaa khamiyaja gitaben rathva ko bhi chukaana pad saktaa he
 Gitaben Rathwa has contested only the district panchayat till now
 aise main loksabhaa chunaav bhi unke liye bhi khel kaa nayaa maidan he
 Because of this, most of their daromdar is on the local BJP organization here
