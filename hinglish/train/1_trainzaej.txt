 adaalat ne indira sagar baandh ko lekar lagaai gai yachika par bhi vahi aadesh lagu karne ko kaha tha
 "the Supreme Court has also upheld the order of the High Court not to fill more than 260 meters of water in the dam without complete rehabilitation," says Agrawal, citing the Jabalpur High Court order

 In this episode, BJP leaders are attacking the Biju government in Odisha a lot
 uttar pradesh ke upmukhyamantri or bhaajapa ke varisht netaa dow
 Dinesh Sharma lashed out at the new Odisha government, saying that the poor of the state has continued to remain poor during the 19-year rule of the Patnaik government
 unhone kaha ki naveen patnayak ne 19 varsh main keval is baat ke liye kaam kiya he ki garib kii garibi dur naa hone paae
 Dinesh Sharma was addressing a public meeting in Nuapada, Odisha
 dow
 Dinesh Sharma said that people developed in all the surrounding states but in Odisha, it became poorer and poorer
 unhone kaha ki 1997 main jab odisha main bhukhmaree faili thi tab maine yuva morcha kaa pradesh adhyaksh rahete hue 14 trek chaaval kii madad kalahandi , balangir, nuapada ko bheji thi
 At that time people were upset for food
 dow
 Sharma said that the regret is that even after this year, the situation in Odisha remains the same
 nuapada main yojit jansabha main dow
 Sharma said that most of the members of Naveen Ji's cabinet are contesting elections but they are facing allegations of some scam
 rajya kii biju sarkaar ne centre kii modi sarkaar dwaara shauchalay nirmaan ke liye bheji gai dhanrashi main bhi ghotaalaa kar diya
 The state government also did not abandon the central government's plan to scam and this is the root cause of Odisha's poverty
 unhone kaha ki naveen babu jis 35 rupaye prati kilo ke chaaval ko ek rupaye main dekar apni peeth thokate hai asal main vah chaaval bhi centre sarkaar dwaara di gai raashi se vitarit kiya jaataa he
 The participation of the new government of the state in it is only one rupee
 dow
 Sharma further said that the Central Government has started various schemes like airport, road, Navodaya School, 7 medical colleges here
 odisha main vikaas asal main modi sarkaar kar rahi he
 The state government is only engaged in carrying out scams
 dow sharma ne aarope lagaaya ki naveen sarkaar sabakaa kalyaan karne vaale bhagwaan jagannatha kii dharti par centre sarkaar kii janata ke liye chalaai gai janakalyankari yojanaon ko rokane kaa kaam kar rahi he
 Giving the example of Uttar Pradesh, he said that there were similar problems before the BJP government came there, but after the arrival of Yogi government, the double engine of development of Modi and Yogi government has changed the picture of the state in just 2 years
 aaj vahaan par sadak he, ghar-ghar bijli kaa conection he, ayushmaan bharat ke tahat 5 lakh ke upachaar kii vyavastha he

 This migration for jobs is the real story of the functioning of the government
 dow sharma ne kaha ki centre sarkaar ne garib mahilaon ko dhuen se nijaat dilaane ke liye gas uplabdh karai he
 Describing the election as a sacrifice, he appealed to the people to win the BJP

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special newzlator The Congress collapsed in this assembly election in Delhi
 pichley chunaav main mili paraajay se bhi neeche
 Why was the Congress eliminated in Delhi? Let's understand ten reasons for this
 chunaav ke din netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ne koi utsaah nahin dikhaaya
 There was no enthusiasm among the Congressmen at the booths
 votaron ke prati apil karne kii koi ichha bhi nahin dikhi
 In many booths, the Congressmen came too late and stayed for a while
 02
 In many seats in Delhi, senior leaders refused to contest elections
 jisase kaaryakartaaon kaa haunsala tutaa
 03
 congress ne purv kendriya mantri ajay maakan ko dilli vidhansabha chunaav kii kaman di
 But Ajay Maken does not sit in the Congress headquarters in Delhi
 iskaa bhi galat sandesh partijanon ke bich gaya
 04
 chunaav kii taarikh kaa elaan ho jane ke baad bhi prachaar main congress ke bade netaa nahin aae
 From the very first day in the campaign, the assembly-wise who were supposed to be seen, they continued to do so
 yahaan tak ki congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne prachaar ke aakhri daur main kuch sabhaayen kin
 05
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main congress kii haar kaa vishleshan ho jane ke baad bhi party ne sabak nahin liya
 The election strategy of Delhi election PC Chacko proved weak for the election
 kaaryakartaaon ko dilli chunaav kii ranneeti ke bare main pataa hi nahin chalaa
 06
 is vidhansabha chunaav main party netaaon ne janata or pehle kaaryakartaaon se majboot samvaad nahin kiya
 Did not take them into confidence
 sandesh gaya ki congress ne chunaav ladane se pehle hi haar maan lee
 07
 dilli main tikaton kaa bantwaaraa karne se pehle vidhansabha str par kaaryakartaaon kii raay nahin lee gai
 Which was considered important in the selection of candidates
 acchhee or saaf chhavi ke ummidavaaron ko chunane kii koshish hi nahin kii gai
 08
 dilli ke anbhavi jaankaar netaaon kii kami kaaryakartaaon ko khalati rahi
 Trusted public leaders were ignored
 chunaav prabharee pisi chaako ne team banaate vakt is baat par dhyaan hi nahin diya
 Ajay Maken failed to communicate with everyone
 09
 Many party leaders who were over-confident in the election were kept in the election
 jo keval party ke aalaa netaaon ke saamne baaten to karte rahe par kshetra main chunaav ke liye kaam nahin kiya
 There were many people who did not even know about the assembly constituency
 10
 The Congress did not properly describe the development work done in Delhi during the tenure of its governments
 prachaar main lage kaaryakartaaon or sthaneey netaaon ko maukey ke hisaab se bayaan or jawaab dene kii sahi training tak nahin di gai
 After all, what is the truth of Imran Khan's UN campaign? India Today Open Source Intelligence explores Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan's recent visit to the US to what his supporters call the most successful foreign campaign of any Pakistani PM
 bharat sarkaar kii ore se jammu or kashmir se anuchhed 370 ke praavdhaan hataae jane par imran ko kuch naa kar paane ke liye apane desh main kaaphi aalochana kaa shikaar hona pad rahaa he
 In such a situation, the noise created during the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in the US over the campaign of Imran has given the Pakistani PM at least a chance to breathe some relief in the internal politics of his country
 khan ke sanyukt raashtra campagne ko lekar prachaarit kiye gaye pahaluon main ek ye bhi rahaa ki unke campagne ko lekar america or global press main ‘pakistan friendli’ kawarej hui
 The India Today Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) investigation has revealed what methods and tactics were adopted by Pakistan during this campaign
 farji engiopakistani campagne kii ore se frontroot par ‘international humanterian foundation ink’ (IHF) naam kaa sanghathan dikhaa jiske bare main pehle zyada nahin suna gaya tha
 Its name first came to the headlines when it appeared on September 22 as the main organizer of the anti-india protest outside the NRG Stadium in Houston
 27 sitambar ko IHF ne neuyork times main puure pej kaa vigyaapan diyanuyork times ke vigyaapan rates ke mutabik is ek vigyaapan ke liye IHF ko ek lakh dollar kharch karne pade honge
 The name of IHF is such that it confuses its non-profit international humanitarian aid group, but no humanitarian aid work of IHF has been seen in the past
 india today kii ore se jo tex collection kii jaankaree jutai gai, uske mutabik IHF kaa gathan piem modi ke huston daure se ek maheene pehle hi hua
 Apart from this, ihf's website was reconstructed through the WHOIS domain and it was found that this website was only 36 days old (till 30 September)
 foundation kii ore se satarkta barti gai ki uskaa pakistan sarkaar se kisi bhi tarah kaa judaav naa dikhe
 It has been shown that it is a non-profit global humanitarian organization
 da piaar farlmerica sthit plateform o'dwyer PR kii report ke mutabik IHF ne america piaar company phenton communications ke saath 50,000 dollar main contract kiya
 The o'dwyer PR platform publishes a ranking of PR companies in the US
 pakistani akhbaar don kii report ke mutabik imran khan ne neuyork yatra ke dauraan phenton communications ke sansthaapak david phenton ke saath baithak bhi kii
 Imran's close behind-the-scenes o'dwyer report also claimed that the IHF was being run by the representative of Imran's party Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf (PTI)
 open sorce data ko jab india today OSINT ne or khangala to aatif iqbaal khan kaa naam saamne aayaa
 Iqbal is also responsible for the president of the Houston chapter of PTI
 iqbaal ne apane soshal media pej par ek sandesh bhi post kiya jisamen us diziner kaa shukriya adaa kiya gaya jisane short notice par neuyork times main prakashit vigyaapan kaa dizin taiyaar kiyapakistani sena se judaavhaalanki imran kii raajnneetik party se jude kai logon kaa campagne se har jagah judaav dikhaa lekin ek shaks kii bhoomika ahm dikhi or wo he pakistan association of greater huston (PAGH) ke president miyaan nazir kii
 Pakistan House in Houston is also run by Mian Nazir
 miyaan nazir kaa pitiai se sidhe taur par koi naata nahin he lekin IHF kii aadhikarik website par bina kisi naam ke ek phone number diya gaya he jo miyaan nazir kaa hi niklaa
 Mian Nazeer posted a draft of that advertisement a day before the date the advertisement was published in the New York Times
 miyaan nazir ko enarji stadium ke baahar bharat virdohi pradarshan ke dauraan bhi dekha gaya
 Mian Nazeer, a permanent resident of Houston, was also seen attending dinner with Pak Army officials at army exclusive clubs in Pakistan
 IHF kii ore se 12 din ke dauraan vigyaapan or piaar (public relations) par hi dedh lakh dollar se adhik kharch kiye gaye
 Apart from this, the cost of the so-called humanitarian aid organization IHF is doubled when the cost of other things like 'free Park and Ride' in Houston and New York is added
 pakistan sthit sarkari dhaanche kii ore is campagne kii funding main ye dhyaan rakhaa gaya ki uske gyaat judaav vaale kisi local chapter yaa bijness forum kaa naam saamne naa aae
 This was done to show that the Kashmir issue was seen as a global humanitarian concern and that the notorious Pakistani tag might not be associated with it during the UNGA campaign
 so haalanki, is saal 'pyaar kaa panchnaama 2', 'kis-kis ko pyaar karun', 'drishyam', 'NH 10', 'dam lagaake haisha' or 'badlapur' bhi hit raheen, lekin inaki kamai ‘bros’ kii kamai yani 77

 com / 8wik7h17uf — Anupriya Patel (@anupriyaspatel) July 26, 2019 Rama Devi was presiding over the House while discussing the Triple Talaq Bill
 muslim mahila (vivaah adhikaar sangrakshan) vidheyak 2019 par charchaa main bhaag lete hue ajam khan ne sadan kii adhyakshata kar raheen rama devi par tippanee kii, jiskaa satta paksh ne virodh kiya
 The ruling party demanded an apology from the Rampur MP
 tippanee par aapatti jaahir karte hue bihar ke shivahar kii saansad rama devi ne kaha ki yah bolne kaa tarika nahin or tippanee ko kaarywahi se hataane kaa aadesh diya
 In response, Azam Khan said, 'you are very respectable
 aap meri bahan kii tarah hai
 Meanwhile, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla came on the pedestal and said that such a non-parliamentary term should not be used
 ajam khan ne doharaaya ki rama devi unki bahan jaisi hai or agar unhone unke khilaaf asansadeey shabd kaa istemaal kiya he to vah sadan se istipha dene ko taiyaar hai
 In his support, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said, 'I do not believe that Azam Khanji has disrespected Asan (rama Devi)
 ye (bhaajapa saansad) log bahut ashisht hai
 Who are these finger lifters? ' unhone kaha, 'agar aap (loksabhaa adhyaksh) sochate hai ki khan dwaara istemaal kiya gaya shabd asansadeey he, to use hataaya janaa chahie
 On this, Birla said, 'it is easy for all of you to say, remove it, remove it, but why did the need to remove it arise? Once a comment is made, it is already in the public domain

 It can become a big hurdle for both parties to come together
 ravivaar ko surajevaala ne yah bhi kaha ki congress dilli main aap ke saath gathbandhan karne par abhi koi nirnay nahin le pai he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday discussed the issue with senior party leaders including Delhi Congress President and former Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit
 gathbandhan kii shuruaati pahal ke daur main aap ne dilli ke alaava punjab or haryana main bhi gathbandhan karne kii congress ke samaksh peshkash kii thi, lekin punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ne pehle hi congress netritv ko rajya main party ke majboot hone kaa hawala dete huye aap ke saath gathbandhan kii jarurat ko sire se khaarij kar diya tha
 After this, former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupendra Singh Hooda has also suggested the party leadership not to combine

 The festive season has started
 aise main khaadya padaarthon main milawat ke maamalon kaa graph bhi upar chadhane lagata he
 The month of August to November is a headache for the Food Safety Authority of India (FSSI)
 aise main ethesai ne is baar pehle se hi ehtiyathan apni kami ko sweekaar karte hue public privet partnership (pipipi) model kii shuruyaat karne kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 Cases of adulteration of food items have increased continuously in the last three years
 lekin food testing laboretory kii kam sankhya or unamem kayrrat staff kii kami ke chalate ke saath hi food inspector kii kam taadaad milawat ke maamalon ko rokane main naakaam sabit ho rahi he
 According to the FSSI official, this time the food inspectors have been given strict instructions to prepare in advance to prevent food adulteration during festivals
 udhar food testing labs ko bhi chust rahane ke nirdesh die gaye hai
 Resources will increase for food security Pawan Agarwal, Chief Executive Officer of FSI, himself said, "due to shortage of staff in government laboratories, testing of food is affected
 kai food testing lab main technician or house keeping karmchaaree behad kam he
 In such a situation, the PPP model will prove to be very helpful in guaranteeing food security
 '' haalanki november, 2018 main india today ko die saakshaatkaar main ek sawaal ke jawaab main mukhya kaaryakari adhikari pawan agarwal ne kaha tha,'' rojaanaa kis kshetra kii kitni dukaanon se sample uthaa yaa kis dukaan ke khaadya utpaadon main kami pai gai, ye aankade jari karnaa sambhav nahin he or isaki jarurat bhi nahin he
 The issue of food safety is no longer an adulteration issue
 ab jarurat khaadya utpaadon ke maanak tay karne kii he, jis disha main ethesai kaam kar rahaa he
 The new law has also been made keeping in mind the Food Safety and Standards, 2006 instead of Prevention of Food
 ''kahin na kahin milawat ke maamalon ko ek saal se bhi kam samay pehle nakaarne vaale ethesai ke pawan agarwal ne is baat ko sweekaara kii khaadya namoonon kii jaanch karne ke liye na keval or pareekshan lab kii jarurat hai karmchaariyon kii sankhya badhaane kii jarurat bhi he
 The Chief Executive Officer also said, "it is not possible to get satisfaction like other countries in food security due to less number of food inspectors than other countries
 lekin ham yah to nahin kah sakate ki hamaare paas 'main power' nahin he isile 'ansef food' hi khaanaa padegaa
 We are bridging this gap by optimally utilizing our resources
 saath hi technology or third party kaa istemaal kar is kshamta ko badhaane kii koshish he
 Therefore, FSSAI has moved towards PPP model to increase resources
 praadhikaran ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki jald hi food inspectors kii sankhya main bhi ijapha kiya ja saktaa he
 Limited resources - fssai's total 3,500 food inspectors in the country
 jabaki america or kanada kii aabaadi hamase behad kam he lekin unke yahaan food inspector kii sankhya hamase kahin zyada
 There are 14,200 food inspectors in the US with a population of 33 crores
 jabaki canada main yah sankhya 4,000 he
 FSSAI has a total of 213 testing labs across the country

 He said that the government claims that the situation in Kashmir is fine

 Expressing dissatisfaction over the non-cooperation of opposition parties, the former home minister said, "we know we do not have a majority in the Lok Sabha, but the AIADMK, YSRCP, TRS, BJD, AAP, TMC, JDU would have cooperated if the opposition had a majority in the Rajya Sabha

 gujarat main chunaavon kii charchaa jorshor se shuru hote hi congress ne apane sambhavit ummidavaaron ke saath baithak kar taiyaari shuru kar di he
 But the attitude of its old ally NCP is worrying it
 ensipi rajya kii zyaadaatar siton par ladane kii baat kah rahi he
 Obviously, anti-bjp votes can be divided by this
 jahaan ek taraf gutbaji main fansi congress ke saamne ekajute hone kii chunauti he vahiin ab ensipi kaa rukh uske saamne nai chunauti banakar aa rahaa he
 The tactics of Amit Shah and Narendra Modi are also being told behind the ncp's strategy
 ensipi ke netaa or purv kendriya mantri prafull patel lagaataar gujarat ke daure kar rahe hai
 He says that his party is preparing to establish its footing in Gujarat outside Maharashtra as well
 gathbandhan kii bajaay unhone gujarat kii zyaadaatar siton par ladane kaa faisla kar liya he
 They are ignoring the Congress' losses
 ve kehete hai ki pichley 22 saalon se unki party kaa congress ke saath gathbandhan he lekin phir bhi congress bhaajapa ko roak nahin pai he
 When the Congress is unable to do anything, why should they not pursue their national plans? After all, there are NCP mps outside Maharashtra as well
 ensipi ke in tewaron se congress chintit he
 The comments is bich congress ke ek pramukh netaa shankarasingh waghela akele ensipi supremeo sharad pavaar se mili to atakalon kaa daur chal padaa ki congress se naaraaz netaa ensipi kii raah pakad sakate hai
 Though Vaghela denied these reports and said that he had met Pawar, but also said that "I do not know who makes you angry
" pavaar sahab mere puraane dost hai to unako bhojan ke liye bulaayaa tha
 But they were busy so i went and had tea and breakfast together, that's it

 NCP leader and former Union Minister Praful Patel is visiting Gujarat continuously
 unka kahana he ki unki party maharashtra ke baahar gujarat main bhi apane paanv jamaane kii taiyaari main he
 Instead of an alliance, they have decided to contest most of the seats in Gujarat
 congress ke nuksaan ke andeshe ko ve darkinar kar rahe hai
 He says that for the last 22 years his party has an alliance with the Congress but still the Congress has not stopped the BJP
 jab congress kuch nahin kar paa rahi he to ve apane rashtriya manasuubon ko aage kyon na badhayen? aakhir maharashtra ke baahar bhi ensipi ke saansad hai
 The Congress is worried about the ncp's attitude
 tippaniyan Meanwhile, when a prominent Congress leader Shankarsinh Vaghela met NCP supremo Sharad Pawar alone, there was a period of speculation that angry leaders from the Congress might take the path of NCP
 haalanki waghela ne in khabaron kaa khandan kiya or bataaya ki ve pavaar se mili to the lekin saath main yah bhi kaha ki ''pataa nahin naaraazgi kii baat koun udaata he

 '' kuch raajnneeti ke jaankaar ensipi kii ranneeti ke peeche amit shah or narendra modi kii chanakya chaal bhi maan rahe hai
 This is seen as a game of anti-bjp vote sharing
 gujarat main jahaan jald chunaavon kii sugabugahat he to raajnneetik daanvpech bhi jamkar khele ja rahe hai
 Though elections are to be held in Gujarat in December this year, but there is a discussion in political circles that BJP can hold elections soon in the state to capitalize on the victory of Uttar Pradesh

 Claims made by the Margaret Thatcher government of helping India in Operation Blue Star, which was launched in 1984 to drive out terrorists from the Golden Temple, have sparked a new controversy in both countries
 varisht bhaajapa netaa arun jetali ne jahaan is abhiyaan se jude sabhi dastavej saamne laane kii maang kii he, vahiin us abhiyaan kii aguwai karne vaale le
 General (retd) KS Brar said that the operation was planned and implemented by the Indian military commanders
 barad ne enditivi se baatcheet main kaha, 'main aashcharyachakit hum, kyonki oparation kii yojana or iskaa karyanvayan bharat main sainya cmanderon ne kiya tha
 There is no question
 
 We have never seen anyone who has come from Britain and is telling us how to plan an operation
 ' He said that British agencies had no role in the operation in which more than a thousand people were killed
 unhone kaha ki saamne aae un dastavejon kii pramanikta kii jaanch kii jaani chahie, jinamein england kii sahaayta kii baat kii gai he
 At the same time, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley said that it is time that the Indian government decides to tell us the truth about what the real facts were
 isse bharat kii janata yah faisla kar paaegi ki 'oparation blue star' ranneetik galati thi yaa nahin

 naveenatam aankadon ke mutabik 28 july tak desh main barish kaa alam yah he ki desh ke 53 fisadi bhubhag par pani bahut kam gira he
 If there is 10 per cent less rainfall than the average at the country level, then the Government Meteorological Department considers it to be deficient, ie Jaluneun rain
 28 july tak desh main hui kul varsha ausat se 13 fisadi kam he, or agar sambhageeya or upsambhageeya str par utarkar jhanken, to desh ke kul 36 upsanbhaagon main 18 upsambhag 19 fisadi se bhi badi jalanunata se jujh rahe hai

 Overall, this is the right time to keep tabs on the drought in the country

 jis par chif justise deepak mishra, justise di vaai chandrachud or justise eem khanvilakar kii bench ke samaksh yachikakartaon kii taraf se varisht vakil abhishek manu singhvi, dushyant dave, raju ramchandran, prashanth bhushan, or vrinda grover, vahiin sarkaar kii taraf se adishnal solicytor janalar tushaar mehta maujuud the
 Appearing for the petitioners in front of the three-judge bench in the Supreme Court, senior advocate Abhishek Manusinhvi said that there was no mention of the arrested people in the police FIR nor any allegation of meeting the accused
 singhvi ne kaha ki giraftaar logon main se ek (sudhaa bharadwaj) ne apni america naagarikta chhodte hue bharat main vakaalat karne ko apane peshey ke taur par chunaa, vah dilli kii neshnal lau uniwarsity main padhaati bhi hai
 But the big matter is disagreement with the government
 vahiin singhvi kaa virodh karte hue adishnal solicytor janalar tushaar mehta ne kaha jin logon kaa is cese se koi lenaa nahin he ve (yachikakarta) supreme court ke samaksh hai
 To which Singhvi said that this matter is related to the right to live and the right to freedom enshrined by Article 21 of the Constitution
 lihaaja in giraftaaryon par roak lagaai jaae
 On the other hand, advocate Dushyant Dave said that these arrests have been done without any thought, which has nothing to do with this case
 sabhi pakshon ko sunne ke baad justise chandrachun ne maharashtra sarkaar ko notice jari karte hue kaha ki asahmati yaa nittefaki hamaare loktantr kaa sefti volve he, yadi aap pressure main sefti volve nahin lagaayenge to wo fat saktaa he
 Therefore, the court grants interim relief to the accused and prohibits arrest till the next hearing, till then all the accused will remain in the house arrest

 The BJP has made a complaint in its petition on the basis of the allegations made by Kapil Mishra
 yachika ke anusaarkapil mishrane jo media main bayaan diya he ki pichley shuukravaar ko unhone dekha ki satyendra jain mukhyamantri ke ghar par unhen do karod rupee de rahe hai
 In his two years as a cabinet minister, he has seen many flaws in the government
 saath hi jain ne unhen nijee taur par bataaya ki unhonekejarivalke rishtedaar kii 50 karod rupee kii jameen kii deal karai thi
 Apart from this, the Chief Minister has also been accused of corruption including pressing reports of Mishra Netanker scam
 bijepi ne maang kii he ki is mudde par jald se jald jaanch kii prakriya shuru kii jaae
 Former Uttarakhand Chief Minister and currently Lok Sabha MP Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank and old Congressman Satpal Maharaj have once again accused Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat
 bijepi ke donon netaaon ne kaha ki uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri harish ravat bhaang kii kheti or sharaab banane kii baat karte hai
 Will Uttarakhand be developed in this way? On the other hand, Harish Rawat is sending a memorandum to the President and Home Minister regarding the land grab in religious places in Uttarakhand
 uttarakhand main ho rahe ghotaale ke taar dilli main congress netaaon se jude hai
 Both BJP leaders demanded that Congress President Sonia Gandhi reply to the Uttarakhand government scam
 ramesh pokharial nishank ne kaha kihrish rawatki sarkaar pradesh kii janata hi nahin balki congress ke netaa bhi naaraaz hai
 Therefore, there is a stampede in the Congress and it seems that there will be no Congress name in Uttarakhand
 nishank ne aage kaha kii harish ravat ne sarkaar bachaane ke liye jo paisa kharch kiya tha ab uski recovery kar rahe hai
 Harish Rawat is called 'harda' in Uttarakhand, now there is 'harda Tax' on everything which is up to twenty percent
 vidhansabha chunaav se pehle uttarakhand main bijepi congress kii andruni ladaai kaa phayda uthaane ke liye koi kasar nahin chhod rahi he
 But the long queue of the Chief Ministerial candidate in BJP is more dangerous than the internal fight within the Congress

 sarkaar kaa tohfa vot main kitna tabdeel hoga, ye to chunaav ke baad nattejey hi bataaenge
 But before that the Modi government's move is being considered as a game changer
 kisaanon kii naaraazgi bhi madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh main mili haar kii ek vajah rahi
 In such a situation, the government has once again made these big stakes to bring farmers into its court
 ek or sarkaar jahaan is yojana ko lekar apana peeth thapthapa rahi he to vahiin congress sarkaar par hamalaa karne kaa koi mauka nahin chhod rahi he
 As soon as this plan was announced, Congress President Rahul Gandhi directly attacked the government
 unhone rojaanaa 17 rupee kisaanon ko dene vaale sarkaar ke faisle ko kisaanon kaa apmaan bataaya
 There are 36 crore voters, target that those who will get the benefit of it are not just a farmer, they are also a voter
 yahi aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main vot bhi daalenge
 12 crore farmers means about 36 crore voters
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki ye skim laakar sarkaar ne yah dikhaane kaa prayaas kiya he ki usne kisaanon ke liye kuch bada kiya he

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Sunday accused Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman of 'lying' in Parliament in connection with the government order of one lakh crore rupees to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), saying that in support of his statement in the House Either present the document or resign
 rahul ke is bayaan par raksha mantri ne palatwaar karte hue kaha ki yah bade shame kii baat he ki congress adhyaksh mudde ko puri tarah samajhe bagaiyr hi desh ko gumraah kar rahe hai

 8 karod rupee ke anubandh par hastakshar kiye hai or 73,000 karod rupee ke anubandhon par hastakshar hone hai

 Contrary to the claim, not a single order has been signed so far
 'rahul gandhi ne twit kar likhaa tha, 'jab aap ek jhooth bolte hai, to aapako pehle jhooth ko chhipaane ke liye or adhik jhooth bolnaa padataa he
 In his eagerness to defend the pm's Rafael lie, the Defense Minister lied in Parliament

 Or resign
 'bataa den ki congress aarope laga rahi he ki maujuuda sarkaar ne rafel deal echeel ke bajaay anil ambani ke saath karai or unhen phayda pahunchaaya
 While the Modi government says that under his rule, the work of strengthening HAL has been done
 sansad main rafel deal se jude aaropon par safai dete hue raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ne kaha tha ki echeel se lagaataar raksha saude kiye ja rahe hai
 On the claim of Sitharaman, Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari said that if Sitharaman fails to confirm his claim in Parliament that HAL was given a contract of one lakh crore rupees, Congress will press for his resignation
 
 unhone kaha ki yadi sarkaar daawa kar rahi he ki usne echeel ko karodon rupee ke anubandh diye to use apane karmchaariyon ko bhugtan karne ke liye udhaar kyon lenaa padaa
 Let me tell you that in a recent media report it has also been claimed that HAL has to borrow to pay salary to its employees
 echeel ne is par kaha he ki company ne 962 karod rupee kaa overdraft liya he
 The amount of money is expected to improve with the projected increase in funds by March

 Winter-born children need more care in the early stages
 lihaaja, agar aap nai-nai maa bani hai to aapke liye yah jaananaa jaruri he ki apane bachche ko sardi se bachaane ke liye kya karen or kya naa karen
 People usually wear a lot of clothes to protect children from frost, which makes the newborn feel uncomfortable all the time
 aise main doctor kehete hai ki thand he, par bachche ko itnaa bhi na dhak den ki uski twachaa saans na le paae
 Some people keep a blower or heater in the house throughout the day to protect them from the cold
 is tarah ke upaay bhi navjaat bachche kii sehat ke liye khatarnaak sabit ho sakate hai
 Follow this Telmallik Radix child specialist Dr
 amit kumaar ne bataaya ki ye sabhi tareeke bahut galat hai
 It is true that it is necessary to protect children from frost, but this method of rescue can put them in other problems
 dow
 According to Amit, these things should be taken care of to protect newborns from frost
 
 
 navjaat bacchon konhlaate vakt is baat kaa dhyaan rahe ki gardan ke upar pani na jane paae
 Bath the baby from under the neck
 chehre, sir or gardar ko geele kapade se pochh sakate hai
 This is because water can enter through the nose, ears, and mouth, which can lead to complications
 sardi se bachane ke liye blower yaa heater kaa istemaal na karen
 The dry air coming out of this causes harm to the child
 isaki jagah aap oir heater kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 To protect children from frost, instead of wearing too much clothes, keep his soles, his palm and his ears and head covered
 ye aise ariaj hai, jahaan se sabase zyada hit los hota he or yaheen se sabase zyada thand lagane kaa dar sabase zyada hota he
 So be sure to wear children's hats, gloves and socks
 bachche ko sulaate samay takiya lagaana ho saktaa he khatarnaak
 
 
 In winter, sunlight is very important, so make sure that the child bathes in the sun every morning
 isse unki haddiyon ke vikaas main madad milegi
 For one to one and a half months, do not let the child come in contact with any outsider, ie people coming from outside the house
 khaastaur se agar vah vyakti infected he to uski god main bachche ko na den
 The immunity of children is not so strong
 vah abhi banane ke daur main hota he, isliye unhen infections se dur rakhane kii jarurat hoti he
 If you want a smart child, do not forget to eat in pregnancy
 These things should not take the child out for one and a half months
 kahin baahar se matlab he, use kahin out stesan yaa public place yaa bheed-bhaad vaali jagah par na le jaaen
 Also, the child is afraid of infection
 bachche ke vikaas ke liye maa kaa doodh sabase jaruri hota he
 The immune system of a child who drinks breast milk for six months is stronger than those who drink milk outside

 pichley 24 ghante main do aise bayaan aae hai jisane puure desh kaa dhyaan apni ore khinchaa he
 One is the statement of former JDU president Sharad Yadav and the other is that of senior BJP leader Vinay Katiyar
 donon bayanon main vot, beti or beauty ke cocktail ne hangaamaa khadaa kar diya he
 Questions are arising that why the discussion of daughter and beauty is necessary for the vote
 priyanka sundar par, smriti ke jane se lagati he bhikepane bayanon ke liye charchaa main rahane vaale bijepi ke netaa vinay katiyaar ne buudhvaar ko congress netaa priyanka gandhi par hamalaa bolte hue seemaa laangh di
 Vinay Katiyar said that Priyanka Gandhi is a beautiful woman
 acha hai ve prachaar karen, bahut dinon se nikali nahin hai, lekin unase zyada sundar mahilaayein to bijepi main hai, jinhen ham laga denge
 He said, 'as much as Priyanka is said to be beautiful, she is not as beautiful
 hamaare yahaan smriti irani hai jo jahaan jaati hai vahaan bheed lag jaati he
 She gives a much better speech than him
 'sharad yadav bole, 'beti se badhkar vot'abhi mangalvaar ko hi jediu ke netaa sharad yadav ne beti se badhkar vot kaa bayaan diya, jis par vah funs gaye or mahila ayog ne unhen notice thama daalaa
 Sharad Yadav said in a program that the cost of votes is higher than the honor of the daughter
 sharad yadav chunavi raajnneeti ke girte str or paise-vot ke gathjod par chintaa jataa rahe the
 During this time, he made this controversial statement
 sharad ne kaha ki paise kii badaulat aaj kal vot ko kharida or bechaa jaataa he
 Though Sharad Yadav also clarified this on Wednesday, seeing the controversy growing, he said in his clarification that i have not given any wrong statement, vote and love and respect for daughter should not be the same

 guuruuvaar ko bijepi kii dilli unit ke pravaktaa tajinder paal singh bagga ne cnnnews18 ke ek twit ko ritvit kiya jisame ek photo memrahul gandhiek aadmi kii taraf haath milaane ke liye apana haath aage bada rahe he lekin saamne khadaa aadmi rahul ko namaste kar rahe he 
 cnnnews18 claimed on this photo that this man refused to join hands with Rahul Gandhi and told Rahul that your father was "father of mob lynching"
 yahaan ye bataanaa jaruri hoga kiraajeev gandhiki jayanti (20 agast) par bagga ne ek survey kaa daawa karte hue vivaadit twit kiya
 It questioned who murdered more innocent Indians? Also claimed to have 30,432 votes, according to Bagga's tweet, 89% of the survey found Rajiv Gandhi to be the most guilty of killing innocent Indians

 com / 2zf4bf5rpa — Divya Spandana / Ramya (@divyaspandana) August 22, 2018 It became clear that what was said with cnnnews18's tweeted photo, which Bagga also retweeted, was wrong
 lekin hairaan karne vaala masalaa yah tha ki cnnnews18 ne apane twit main kis aadhaar par ye daawa kiya
 This story also became clear on its own by visiting this Twitter handle of cnnnews18
 yah handle News18 tivi channel kaa parody yani nakli acount he
 It is also written on the profile of this parody account that it is a parody account and has nothing to do with CNN or news18
 parody acount vah acount hote he jo mazaaq yaa vyangy ke liye banaaye jate he
 This account looks like a social media account of a news channel, artist, leader etc
 but is fake
 ye acount itani hoshiyaari se banaae jate he ki agar koi dhyaan na de to aasaani se jhaanse main aa saktaa he
 Parody accounts write laughter jokes or satire news which people unknowingly share
 misaal ke liye agar aap uparokt parody twitor acount ko dekhen to ise News18 tivi channel ke twitor acount jaisaa dikhaane kii koshish kii gai he
 The profile picture which the News18 TV channel has used on its Twitter account, the same photo parody account has put on its profile picture
 parody acount kaa twitor handle or yujar nem dekhen to ye bhi asli acount jaisaa banane kii koshish kii gai he
 The Twitter handle of the News18 TV channel is "cnnnews18", while the Twitter handle of the parody account is cnnews69
 aap dekh sakate he ki News18 ke twitor par "blue tik" laga hua he jiskaa matlab yah veryphid acount he
 Such parody accounts also change their user name from time to time
 jabatjinder paal singh baggane is twit ko ritvit kiya tha tab is parody acount kaa yujar nem cnnnews18 tha lekin kuch hi der baad hi iskaa yujar nem cnnnews69 ho gaya tha
 Now it is not clear whether Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga also got cheated by this parody account due to the news channel or he retweeted it despite knowing the parody account? But it is often seen that people get caught in the clutches of these parody accounts

 The budget of Delhi may be described by CM Arvind Kejriwal and Deputy CM Manish Sisodia presenting the budget of the public

 In fact, in the budget which is being called a tax-free budget, almost everything needed by the common man will become expensive
 jaruri saamaan ho jayega mahangaab dilli main duusare rajyon se maal lekar aane vaale malwahak vaahanon ko 100 rupee se lekar 1500 rupee tak tex ke taur par chukaane honge
 Delhi has nothing of its own
 yani chaaval, daal, tel, fal, sabji or yahaan tak ki doodh bhi 1 july se mahangaa hone kii ummid he
 If all the things also became expensive by just one rupee a kilo, then your budget will have a monthly impact of thousands of rupees
 cinema dekhnaa mahangadilli main ab manoranj tex 20 fisadi se doguna karke 40 fisadi kar diya gaya he
 If there was a ticket of 500 rupees in Delhi, then the entertainment tax was 100 rupees in it, which will now increase by 100 rupees on every ticket
 yani paanch logon kaa parivaar agar movie dekhnaa niklaa to sidhe 500 rupee kii chapat lagegi
 When i went to see the film four times in a month, then an additional budget of 2000 rupees
 baat bas itane par hi khatm nahin ho rahi he
 If you do not watch movies outside, you will watch cable or DTH at home
 lekin ab har cabel conection ke liye har maheene 40 rupee or dene honge
 If there are two connections in the house, then the cable bill of Rs 80 will increase

 The luxury tax is covered by marriage pandals, gyms, star hotels and clubs
 yahaan tex 10 se badhaakar 15 fisadi kiya gaya he yani sidhe dedh guna

 Navratri 2017: kya he sharad navaratri, upwas ke dauraan in kuch baton kaa rakhen khaas khyaal The answer to this question is not so easy
 kai logon kaa maananaa he ki vrath ke dauraan sirf chaay kaa seven hi kiya ja saktaa he, magar coffee pine vaale is tark ke khilaaf hai
 At the same time there are some people who believe that both tea and coffee can be consumed during fasting
 prasiddh khaadya lekhak anuthi vishaal kaa kahana he, navaratri upwas ke niyamon ko lekar kahin bhi aisa kuch nahin likhaa he
 Every human has his own personal preference
 kai saalon pehle, logon ne is tarah ke niyam banaaen
 Navaratri is the time in which a person purifies his body by not consuming meat and food grains
 to is dauraan chaay or coffee jaise peya padaartho kaa seven kiya ja saktaa he

 hamaari koshish yahi hoti he ki packed or processd peya padaarth kaa seven na kiya jaae kyonki unamem kai kritrim agent hote hai
 Housewife Sarabjit Singh says that coffee may have a high caffeine content, but it is not known why coffee is skipped during Navratri
 kaaphi samay pehle coffee bharat main bahut zyada lokapriy nahin thi or yah abhi bhi chaay ke mukaable nahin he
 i doubt that there is any rule regarding this in Navratri
 har vyakti kii apni pasand he
 The important here is to avoid consuming things like meat, egg, wine, onion, garlic etc
 during Navratri

 sharir ko kai sankraman se bachaane ke liye, kuch chuninda khaadya padaartho ko apni diet main shaamil karen

 10 of the night
 00 baje kaa vakt tha jab puri dilli ke saath-saath malviya nagar ilaake ke log bhi sone kii taiyaari kar the
 Just then, a CCTV camera installed here sees the bag hanging on the shoulder and talking on the mobile, passing through the road
 wo apane baalo par haath pherati hui aane vaale vakt se bilkul bekhbar bade aaraam se chali ja rahi he
 But after passing 10 seconds, another person can also be seen walking with sharp steps behind him
 safed shart or phulpant pahane ye shaks apni shart kii bahen chadhaata hua jis teji se ladki kii taraf lapakata he, use dekh kar lagane lagata he ki ho naa ho uske iraade thik nahin hai
 And then after that, exactly what is feared
 wo peeche se jaakar sidhe ladki ko gardan se daboch letaa he or usase uskaamobile phone chhinaneki koshish karne lagata he
 The girl is frightened by this sudden attack, but she does not leave her phone
 balki shor machaati hui peeche hatane lagati he
 But the attacker continues to intimidate her, pushing her backwards and carrying one attack after another, behind the cars parked on the side of the road
 or phir vahaan pahunch kar wo ladki par or buree tarah tut padataa he, use peetane lagata he
 And the girl keeps screaming and screaming badly during this entire sequence
 tabhi sadak ke duusari taraf kuch halchal dikhaai detii he
 That is, within 15 seconds of arresting the girl of Hamlawar, some people are seen moving a wall and moving towards the occasion
 isi bich ladki par hamalaa karanevaale shaks ko achaanak hi apane ghirne kaa ahsaas hone lagata he
 And leaving his victim, the girl, runs at the same speed as the bullet from which he was seen for the first time when he came in this road
 diwaar phaand kar maukey kii taraf badhate kuch ladke ab puri raftaar se hamalavar ke peeche bhaagate hue najar aate hai
 But since the attacker's life has been built here, he runs on his head and runs away
 darasal, 19 agast kii raat ko jabauzbekistanse ai ladki sonia dilli main apane dost ke ghar laut rahi thi, to peeche se suraj naam ke ladke ne usase uskaa mobile phone chhinane kii koshish kii
 But before he could get out of his mobile by relaxing, the other characters of this incident, playing in the park of the nearby colony, these boys spoiled his whole game
 darasal, MNM yani malviya nagar maniek ke naam se ek club bana kar har roj raat ko park main footbal khelanevaale in ladakon kaa dhyaan tab pehali baar is marpet or lutpaat kii taraf gaya, jab sonia suraj ke changul main funs kar buree tarah cheekh rahi thi
 At first, these boys felt that perhaps some road victim was suffering from pain
 lekin jab unhone car ke peeche ek ladke ko ek ladki ke upar tabadatod ghunse barasaate dekha, to unhen maamla samajhate der nahin lagi
 So, all was set? After this, the footballer who ran the ball to the goalpost, chased Japatmar in such a way that soon Japamar was not able to stand on his feet
 emenem ke jambaajon kii maane to jald hi hamale or lutpaat kaa aaropee suraj unhen gachha dekar andhere main gum hone main kaamyaab ho chukaa tha or wo man masos kar khaali haath waapas lautne kii taiyaari kar rahe the
 But then something happened that the whole game was overturned
 malviya nagar ke skool ke kareeb pahunch kar wo jhapatmar andhere main gum ho chukaa tha
 Now all the boys started to think that maybe that crook will not come in their hands
 lekin tabhi ek ladke kii najar skool ke paas khadi kaaron ke peeche andhere main chhupate ek ladke par gai
 But as soon as he saw, the man not only came out from the back of the car, but also started going forward with great comfort
 ladakon ko us par shaq to ho rahaa tha, jab unhone is car ke peeche chupanevaale shaks se vahaan chupane kaa sabab poocha to wo chhipane kii baat se inkaar karne laga
 He said that he was just passing by
 jaahir he, wo munh se beshak jhooth bol rahaa ho, uski tej chalati saanson or chehre ke haav-bhav ne uski pole khol kar rakh di
 Just what happened to him after this
 use sahi-sahi alphaajon main bayaan karnaa bhi mushkil he
 So far, the boys of MNM, Malviya Nagar Maniac, who have bounced the football with their kicks, have punched and kicked them so much that their condition is not able to move
 lekin abhi uske jhapatmar hone kii tasdik kerani baaki thi
 Therefore, the boys hanged him with hands and feet and took out the same fate, from where the incident started
 jaahir he koi bhi gunahagaar kabhi khud ko gunahagaar nahin bolta
 And following this philosophy, this snatcher also refused to carry out any such incident
 wo bhi tab jab use aisa karte hue ek nahin, balki park main khel rahe dason ladakon ne dekha tha
 Now in such a situation, the boys of the locality did the same to the police to confess to it, which is usually done by the police
 lekin marpet ke maamle main chunki ye ladke nausikhie the, to unhone jhapatmari karte hue pakade gaye suraj kii aisi dhunaai kii ki wo chalane-phirane laayak bhi nahin rahaa
 Now after this, the boys came to bring him on a chance
 jahaan kuch der main resident welfare associsheshan ke adhikariyon samet police bhi aa pahunchi
 It is here that the boys also identified the victim girl, ie Sonia, as her attacker, and then handed over Japatmar to the police
 lekin is vaakye ne jahanmalaviya nagarmaniek ke jambaazon ko raaton-raat puure ilaake main mashhoor kar diya, vahiin khudgarji ke iljaamon se ghirti dilli ko phir se dil waalon kii dilli banane kii koshish kii
 The US has strongly objected to the threats of nuclear attack by Pakistan against India and has informed Pakistan of its unhappiness in this regard

 adhikari se jab asif ke is bayaan ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, 'yah bahut chintajanak he
 This is a serious matter
 ' Asif told a Pakistani news channel in his latest interview, "if India tries to fight us, we will destroy it

 unhone kaha, 'in hathiyaaron kii suraksha hameshaa hamaari chintaa kaa vishay rahaa he
 Apart from what he has said in this particular case, we always keep an eye on the safety of these weapons
 ' Meanwhile, Defense Ministry Deputy Spokesperson Mark Toner said in his daily press conference that nuclear-capable countries "have a very clear responsibility to exercise restraint regarding nuclear weapons and missile capabilities"
 ' At the same time, the US appealed to India and Pakistan to take steps to reduce the increased tension after the Uri terrorist attack

 Highest love engagement
 duryodhana kii mewa tyaagi, saag vidura ghar pai
juthe fal sabari ke khaaye bahubidhi prem lagaai
prem ke bas nrip seva kini aap bane hari nai

prem ke bas arjuna-rath haankyo bhul gaye thakuraai
aisi preet badi brindaban gopin naach nachaai
sur krur is laayak naahin kahan lagi karon badai
bhavarth: surdaas ji kehete hai ki paraspar prem kaa rishta hi bhagwaan kii drushti main bada rishta he
 Abandoning Duryodhana's serving of nuts, which was revered with pride, Lord Krishna took the greens made by Vidura with green leaves with love and respect
 prem ke vasheebhoot ram ne shabari naam kii bhil stri ke juthe ber khaae the
 Under the love of Lord Krishna, he went as a messenger to his devotee Narasimha Mehta
 prem ke vasheebhoot hi unhone yudhisthir dwaara kiye gaye rajasuya yajna main juthi pattalen swayan uthaai thim
 It was because of love that during the Mahabharata war, he accepted to be the charioteer of Arjuna's chariot
 gopiyon ke nishkaam-prem ke to bhagwaan itane vasheebhoot ho gayi ki unke kahe anusaar hi naachte the arthath jaisaa vah kahati thim vaisaa hi ve karte the
 Surdas says that my heart is hard, there is no love in it, so i am not able to praise God too much
 bhakthi dhara ke mahaan kavi surdaas kii janm tithi or janmasthan ko lekar sahityakaron main kaaphi matbhed he
 Nevertheless, on the basis of evidence derived from the texts, it is believed that Mahakavi Surdas was born in the year 1535 in a village named Runakta on Vaishakh Shukla Panchami
 yah gaanv mathura-agra maarg ke kinare sthit he
 His father's name was Ramdas
 vah bhi ek geetkaar the
 It is said that Surdas was born, but there is no authentic evidence of this
 bhagavad bhakthi main leen rahane vaale surdaas ne apane ko puri tarah se krishna bhakthi main samarpit kar diya tha
 It is believed that due to Krishnabhakti, he left home at the age of 6 only after taking orders from his father
 iske baad se hi ve yumna tat ke gauughat par rahane lage
 It is said that when he set out on a journey to Vrindavan Dham, the Leela land of Lord Krishna, he met Ballabhacharya
 mahakavi surdaas ne ballabhacharya se hi bhakthi kii diksha praapt kii
 The interesting fact about Surdas and his guru Vallabhacharya is that there was a difference of only 10 days in the age of the guru-disciple
 kuch vidwaan guru ballabhacharya kaa janm 1534 main baishakh krishna ekadshi ko ko maanate hai, isiilie kai surdaas kaa janm bhi 1534 kii baishakh shukla panchami ko maanate hai
 Guru Ballabhacharya, it is said, used to take his disciple Surdas with him to the Govardhan Parvat Temple, where he served Shrinathji, singing new verses every day through ikatare
 ballabhacharya ne hi surdaas ko 'bhagwat lila' kaa gungan karne kii salaah di
 Earlier, he used to make the post of Vinaya only in a humble sense
 surdaas kii krishna bhakthi ke bare main kai kathaayen prachlit hai
 According to a legend, once Surdas was so immersed in devotion to Krishna that he fell into a well, after which Lord Krishna himself saved his life and appeared in his conscience
 kaha to yahaan tak jaataa he ki jab krishna ne surdaas kii jaan bachaai to unki netra jyoti lautaa di thi
 In this way Surdas first saw his adorable, beloved Krishna in this world
 kehete hai krishna ne surdaas kii bhakthi se prasann hokar jab unase vardaan maangane ko kaha, to surdaas ne kaha ki mujhe sab kuch mil chukaa he, aap phir se mujhe andhaa kar den
 He did not want to see anyone other than Krishna
 mahakavi surdaas ke bhakthimay geet har kisi ko mohit karte hai
 The fame of his design and lyricism spread far and wide
 saahitiyik halkon main is baat kaa zikr kiya jaataa he ki akbar ke nau ratnon main se ek sangeetkaar tansen ne samraat akbar or mahakavi surdaas kii mathura main mulaakaat bhi karwaai thi
 There is a description of unwavering love and devotion towards Krishna in the compositions of Surdas
 in rachanaaon main vatsalya ras, shant ras, or shrangaar ras shaamil he
 Through his imagination, Surdas has described Krishna's wonderful childlike form, his beautiful form, his divinity
 iske alaava surdaas ne unki lilaon kaa bhi varnan kiya he
 There is so much vitality in Surdas's compositions, as if he has seen the entire Krishna Leela with his own eyes
 mahakavi surdaas dwaara likhit 5 granthon main sur sagar, sur saravali or sahitya lahari, nal-damyanti or byaahlo shaamil hai
 Sursagar is his most famous book
 is granth main surdaas ne shri krishna kii lilaon kaa bakhubi varnan kiya he
 It is said that there are a collection of 1
25 lakh posts in this book, but now only seven to eight thousand posts are left
 sursagar kii 1656 se lekar 19veen shatabdi ke bich tak sirf 100 pratiyaan hi mil pai hai
 Of the 12 chapters of Sursagar, 11 are abbreviated and the 10th wing is found in great detail
 surasaravali bhi surdaas kaa ek pramukh granth he
 It contains a total of 1107 verses
 kehete hai ki surdaas ji ne is granth kii rachana 67 saal kii umr main kii thi
 This entire book was composed as a song of 'great Holi'
 is granth main bhi krishna ke prati unka alokik prem dikhataa he
 Sahitya Lahiri is also another famous poem of Surdas
 sahityalahari 118 padon kii ek laghurachana he
 The special point of this book is that in its last verse Surdas has mentioned about his family tree, according to which Surdas is named 'surajdas' and he is a descendant of Chandbardai
 surdaas ji kaa yah granth shringaar ras kii koti main aata he
 nal-damayanti is a Mahabharata period story of Nal and Damayanti, apart from Krishna devotion to Surdas, Biyalo Surdas is also another famous book
 kaha jaataa he ki surdaas 100 varsh se adhik umr tak jivit rahe

 This is not the first time that big notes have been withdrawn in the country and then thousand, five thousand and ten thousand rupees have been brought to the market afresh
 1946 main main bhi hazaar rupye or 10 hazaar rupye ke note waapas liye gaye the
 Then in 1954, the notes of thousand, five thousand and ten thousand rupees were brought back

 On 14 January 1978, r Janaki Raman, senior officer of the Reserve Bank's Chief Accountant Office, was called and called to Delhi
 raman dilli pahunche to unase ek sarkari adhikari ne kaha ki sarkaar bade note waapas lene kaa man bana chuki he or isse sambandhit zaruri adhyadesh wo ek din main banaaen
 During this time, any interaction with the Reserve Bank's central office in Mumbai was strictly forbidden as it feared needless speculation to spread

 aiji patel ne likhaa ki kaale dhan ko nakad ke rup main bahut kam log lambey samay tak apane paas rakhte hai
 According to Patel, the idea of hiding large sums of money in suitcases and pillows is of a very childish type and those who have a large amount of cash as cash will also get them replaced through their agents

 According to him, some members of the Janata Party government believed that this step had been taken to target the alleged corrupt people of the previous government
 patel ne ye bhi likhaa ki jab tatkaaleen vitt mantri echem patel ne unase note waapas lene ko kaha to unhone, vitt mantri ko saafe kaha tha ki is tarah ke faisalon se manamaafik parinaam kam hi milte hai
 IG Patel wrote that very few people keep black money as cash for a long time
 patel ke mutabiq, suutakes or takie main badi rakam chhupaakar rakhane kaa idia hi bada bachakaana kism kaa he or jinke paas badi raqam cash ke taur par he bhi wo bhi apane agents ke zarie unhen badalawa lenge
 Patel has written that he was not in favor of this decision of the government
 unke mutabiq janata party kii sarkaar ke hi kuch sadsy maanate the ki pichhali sarkaar ke kathith bhrasht logon ko nishaanaa banane ke liye ye qadam uthaaya gaya he
 Patel also wrote that when the then Finance Minister HM Patel asked him to withdraw the note, he had clearly told the Finance Minister that such decisions rarely yield the desired results
 aiji patel ne likhaa ki kaale dhan ko nakad ke rup main bahut kam log lambey samay tak apane paas rakhte hai
 According to Patel, the idea of hiding large sums of money in suitcases and pillows is of a very childish type and those who have a large amount of cash as cash will also get them replaced through their agents

 The growing tension between the censor board and filmmakers regarding adult content in films will probably end
 kyonki film sensor board(cbfc) ne shyaam benegal cameti kii ore se sujhaaye gaye filmon kii catagori badhaane ke suzav par amal karne kaa man bana liya he
 According to the news published in Hindustan times, the censor board has agreed that it would be better to include them in another new category rather than flaunting adult scenes
 maujuuda samay kii baat karen to ‘A’ or ‘UA’ certificate ko lekar filmmekars or sensor board ke bich kai baar nok jhonk kii khabaren surkhiyon main rahi hai
 Because kissing scene, sex content and abusive gloat content has been included in the 'A' category from the censor board
 lekin indinon amuman sabhi filmon main is tarah kaa content shaamil he
 Therefore, for such films, the director, producer is seen fighting with the censor board for 'UA' certificate
 isliesensor bordne bold or neude contate vaali filmon ko lekar kai or shreniyon ko shaamil karne kaa faisla liya he
 The Censor Board will soon send the suggestion of these new categories to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting

 Under this censor board proposal, these new categories have been created for films: u and UA categories have been changed to UA12 + and UA15 +

 cricket ke mahakumbh yani vishwa cap kii shuruyaat bhale hi aaj se 36 saal pehle hui lekin isaki neenv lagbhag 100 saal purv 1912 main rakh di gayi thi
 It is a matter of those days when the first two World Cup champions West Indies and then the title winning India did not play international cricket
 us samay simit overon kii cricket nahin thi or keval teen timen austrailia, england or dakshin africa test match khelti thi
 Therefore, a triangular tournament of Test cricket was played between these three teams from 27 May to 22 August 1912
 is tarah ke toornament kaa prastaav imperial cricket parishad (jo baad antarrashtriya cricket parishad bani) ne july 1909 main apni pehali baithak main rakhaa tha
 However, due to bad weather and lack of competitive cricket, the tournament did not succeed and no such competitions were held, but it became a guide for such tournaments including the World Cup
 iske baad jab 1960 main simit overon ke cricket kii shuruyaat hui to kai tiimon ke bich toornament yojit karne kii ummid bandha gayi
 The knockout tournament between county teams in England gave wings to this expectation as the women cricketer became the inspiration for men who played the first World Cup in 1973 to pave the way for the Men's World Cup
 mahila vishwa cap vyavsaayee jaik heward ke dimag kii upaj tha
 He then spent 40,000 pounds on this tournament
 england main khele gayi is vishwa cap main saat tiimon ne shirkat kii thi
 Host England won the title by defeating Australia in the final played at Edgbaston on 28 July
 england main county tiimon ke bich nakout toornament ke aayojan kaa vichaar leastershar ke sachiv mike turnar ne rakhaa tha
 The Midlands Cup was then held in England, while the Gillette Cup, starting in 1963, was quite popular
 pehla ekadivasiy match paanch janvari 1971 ko austrailia or england ke bich melbern main khelaa gaya tha jiske chaar saal baad england main shuruaati vishwa cap kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 In England itself, then there was the infrastructure to organize such big tournaments, so it hosted not only the 1975 but also the 1979 and 1983 World Cups
 westeindies 1975 or 1979 main pehle donon vishwa cap jeetne main safal rahaa jabaki 1983 main bharat ne champion banakar puure cricket jagat ko hairaan kar diya tha
 The World Cup was held for the first time out of England in 1987 in India and Pakistan jointly in which Australia managed to win their first title
 austrailia ko pehali baar 1992 main mejabani kaa mauka mila jahaan pakistan champion rahaa
 The Sri Lankan team won the title when India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka hosted it in 1996
 iske baad 1999 main england, 2003 main dakshin africa or 2007 main westeindies main yojit kiye gayi vishwa cap main austrailia champion bana
 Now the World Cup is being held jointly in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, while in 2015 it will be hosted by Australia and New Zealand

 14 December 2011: See in pictures India Today, after allowing President Zardari to remain in power for three years, what reasons did the army finally turn against him? The root of this can be traced to the May 2, 2011, attack on American Special Forces on Abbottabad

 Zardari is said to have asked to do so
 isamen america se anurodh kiya gaya tha ki vah pakistan ke generalon par lagaam lagaae or takhtapalat ko roke
 In return, the civilian government had assured the US that it would disband the ISI branch of the ISI, which was tasked with spreading violence in Afghanistan

 He returned to the country on 18 December after a lengthy conversation between Gilani and General Kayani
 sarkari taur par kaha gaya ki gilaani ne raashtrapati or sena pramukh ke bich sankshipt baatcheet karai
 Since then, the government has begun to publicly control the military
 gilaani ne 27 disambar, 2011 ko kaha, 'koi vyakti yah nahin kah saktaa ki vah sarkaar ke maatahat nahin he
 He reiterated at a function at the National Defense University, Islamabad, on January 6 that 'the army should remain under civil rule

 'general Kayani was also at the ceremony

 He called a meeting of corps commanders on 11 January
 unhone yah bhi elaan kiya ki ve islamabad sthit 111 brigade ke pramukh kii jagah duusare adhikari ko niyukt karne ja rahe hai
 The transfer to the 'coup brigade' — which has overturned the civilian government three times and put the military in power — was a clear indication that General Kayani was only meant by his work
 choubees ghante ke bheetar pakistan kii naagarik sarkaar ne khud ko desh ke do sabase shashaktsansthaanon ke bich fansaa paaya
 The Supreme Court on 10 January accused Gilani of not being an 'honorable person' as he refused to write letters to Swiss authorities to reopen cases related to black money against Zardari
 gilaani ke ek sahaayak ne 11 janvari ko india today ko bataaya ki fouj ke bayaan se pradhanmantri or raashtrapati donon hairaan the
 He said, 'dangerous bells have started ringing due to rapidly changing conditions
 ' fouj china pipuls daily online ko die gilaani ke intervyuu se pareshaan thi
 In this, Gilani had said that General Kayani and DG ISI should be taken
 general shuja pasha ne supreme court main jo bayaan diya tha, vah 'asanvaidhanik or gaiyr-kanoonee' tha
 The interview was seen as a blow to General Kayani, who returned from a week-long official visit to Beijing

 1992 is coming before 2019 but has arrived
 intazaar ab is baat kaa he ki pradhanmantri narend modi kab 1992 ke is siyaasi khel main utarate hai
 Recall the speeches of Narendra Modi as the Prime Ministerial candidate in 2014, do you remember any speeches that mainly focus on the Ram temple
 us chunaav main maa ganga zarur aa gai thim magar ram mandir kaa sawaal menifisto main kisi kinare darj tha
 The Ram temple was mentioned on page number 37 in the 2014 manifestos
 38 pej ke menifeston main 37wein pej par wo bhi teen line
 But for a few days Ram temple has come on the front page in the speech of BJP and Sangh leaders
 sawaal he pradhanmantri modi kab ram mandir par bhaashan denge
 In the post-2014 assembly elections, Prime Minister Modi used to say that if there is a government in the state and Delhi will work like a team
 phir jab mukhyamatri yogi adityanath ne faizabad zile ko ayodhya kiya tab pradhanmantri kaa koi twit kyon nahin aayaa
 No tweet came from BJP President Amit Shah
 jabaki yogi ji kii ghoshnaa ke baad tak pradhananmatri apane twitor handle par sakriy the, logon ke twit kaa jawaab de rahe the
 Shouldn't this day be congratulating Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on this big decision? Or both want to reach an undisclosed destination walking on different paths
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ayodhya ko lekar shuru se spasht hai
 He was there even before last Diwali
 is diwali ke pehle bhi vahiin hai
 BJP has asked opposing parties but the Prime Minister has not yet stated his opinion
 intazaar kiijie ki ve kab vikaas chhodkar yaa vikaas ke saath saath ram mandir ke maamle main khulkar aate hai
 Here Delhi is busy with something else
 sibiai kaa jhagada sadak par he, court main he
 RBI quarrel is coming on the road every day
 aaj us jhagade kaa mul kaaran saamne aa gaya
 The first news of the Indian Express is that the Reserve Bank has refused to give 3 lakh 60,000 crore to the government
 pichley buudhvaar ko hi sarkaar ne kaha tha ki vah arabiai kii swaittata kaa sammaan karti he lekin donon ko bhartiya arthvyavastha kii zaruuraton ke hisaab se janhit main kaam karnaa hoga
 This report by Sunny Verma of Express has given the reason for the quarrel
 bhartiya reserve bank ke paas 9
 There is a reserve of 59 lakh crores
 isamen se 3
 6 lakh crore is surplus
 sarkaar yahi hissaa apane liye chaahati he
 The Ministry suggests that both the government and the Reserve Bank can decide jointly how to use this surplus
 maujuuda jo niyam hai wo behad rudhiwaadi soch ke aadhaar par banaae gaye hai
 Sources in the RBI have told the Reserve Bank that the government wants to join the Reserve Bank's Reserve Treasury
 aisa hoga to vyapak arthvyavastha kii sthirataa par asar padegaa
 The RBI rejected the proposal
 aisa nahin he ki reserve bank saraples nahin detaa he, notebandi ke saal ko chhod den to aam taur par yah 50,000 karod ke paas hota hi he
 But the government is eyeing 3 lakh 60 thousand crores
 taaki is paise ko un bainkon ke hawaale kiya ja sake jinke paas puunji nahin he or ve aage phir se sabko lone baantne lagen
 You may remember that the controversy started last week when Deputy Governor Viral Acharya gave the example of Argentina that the government there also wanted to take over the treasury of the Reserve Bank, in protest the governor resigned and there was devastation
 Has gone
 lekin express kii is khabar se isaki pushti hoti he ki viral acharya argentina ke bahaane sarkaar ke iraade ko hi public kar rahe the
 Was telling the public
 akhbaar ne likhaa he ki apane reserve se paisa dene kii shart reserve bank ne tab kar liya jab sarkaar kaa koi numaayinda uske board main maujuud nahin tha
 What will be the result of this tussle between the RBI and the government, whether the Reserve Bank will hand over its reserves to the government, what effect it will have on the economy, many experts say that will not have a good effect
 hamaare sahyogi himanshu ne vipin malik se baat kii he jo reserve bank ke board ke sadsy rahe hai
 Says Vipin Malik, 'the government says that the RBI should give it 2 lakh or 3 lakh crore out of its reserve
 ye nahin ho saktaa he
 In the budgetary estimates of the government, the market borrowing program was not being completed
 11 saarvajanik kshetra ke bank pisie main chale gaye hai
 The rest of the banks have a cash crunch
 ' Money has been taken from the Reserve Bank's Reserve once during the war with China
 tab to yuddh chal rahaa tha lekin lambey samay ke itihaas main iske alaava doosraa udhaaharan nahin he
 What are the circumstances now when the government is eyeing rbi's Reserve Surplus
 is bich purv governor raghuram rajan kaa intervyuu aayaa he
 Rajan has spoken to CNBC channel anchor Lata Venkatesh ji
 rajan ne bhi dipti governor viral aacharya kii baat kaa ek tarah se samarthan kiya he ki sarkaar ko reserve bank par haath daalane kaa prayaas nahin karnaa chahie, yah arthvyavastha ke liye acha nahin he
 Once you have appointed someone as governor and deputy governor, you should listen to them
 sarkaar or arabiai ek duusari kii soch kaa sammaan karen
 RBI will have to play like Rahul Dravid and not like Navjot Singh Sidhu
 swatantra or majboot arabiai se desh ko phayda hoga
 This ongoing confrontation between the government and the RBI should not escalate anymore
 rashtriya sanstha ke rup main rigerv bank ko bachaana zaruri he
 If the government gives too much pressure, then the Reserve Bank has the right to say no
 sarkaar reserve bank ke paas apana paksh rakhe lekin faisla arabiai kare
 The job of the Reserve Bank's board is not to defend other interests but to protect the interests of its institution
 ' Let us tell you again that Raghuram Rajan has given this interview to CNBC News Channel anchor Lata Venkatesh
 lekin sarkaar kyon reserve bank se yah paisa lenaa chaahati he
 It happened once during the China War but it was the time of the war, never did the government hand over the reserve of the Reserve Bank after that
 sarkaar jab daawa kar rahi ho ki jiesti or inakam tex se kar sangrah bad gaya he tab kyon sarkaar ko is paise kii zarurat he
 There is a meeting of the governing body of the Reserve Bank on 19 November
 us baithak main kaaphi kuch tay hona he
 Non-banking financial institutions are going through a crisis
 aapako pataa hi hoga ki lephes sankat main he
 The loans taken by many of its companies have not been repaid
 yah sansthaaen bhi lone lekar aage lone detii hai lihaaza jab yah apana lone nahin chukaa paaengi to bazaar main paise kii kami ho jaaegi
 In a way, there can be chaos
 jab pehali baar yah khabar ai thi ki lephes bhi difolt karne lagi he tab bazaar girane laga tha
 Assocham secretary general Uday Verma is also seen standing with the government in a way
 rajan ne bhi verma kii tarah bayaan diya he ki reserve bank ko enbiensi ke sankat ko dur karne ke liye paisa daalana chahie
 There are a lot of articles published in English newspapers that the Reserve Bank is autonomous but its boss is the government, so the government should be obeyed in the public interest
 kyon achaanak is paise ke liye rigerv bank par janhit kaa dabaav daalaa ja rahaa he
 This is also a question
 antim raay banane se pehle surajeet bhalla, prabhaat patnayak ke lekh ko padhie
 Many more people have also written
 ab baat ayodhya kii
 After renaming Allahabad, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has changed the name of Faizabad district
 pehle ayodhya faizabad zile main aata tha, ab ayodhya ke naam kaa jila ho gaya
 Ayodhya, the city of Ram, has got the title of district, this has been shown by the media as big news
 ayodhya ke naam se vidhansabha seat pehle se he
 The name of the Lok Sabha is Faizabad
 kya isi ke saath loksabhaa kshetra kaa naam bhi badal jayega yaa sansadeey kshetra faizabad hi kehalaayegaa
 Lallu Singh of BJP is an MP from Faizabad
 faizabad se hamaare sahyogi pramod shrivastav ne bataaya ki pradhanmantri modi 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main faizabad gaye the, ayodhya nahin gaye the
 Faizabad did not even go to Ayodhya in the 2017 assembly elections
 ayodhya vidhansabha seat se bijepi ke hi vidhayak hai
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has visited Ayodhya 7 times and Faizabad 3 times
 sawaal he pradhanmantri modi ayodhya kab jaaenge, babari masjid dhwans or ram mandir ke masale par kab bolenge
 Whatever it is, such a big announcement has been made and no tweet came from the Prime Minister and Amit Shah from 6 pm to 9 pm, when the prime time started
 is bade elaan ke saath donon ne yogi adityanath ko badhai nahin di
 It is not that Prime Minister Modi has not tweeted on Ayodhya, his tweet has come at 6
40 AM which has a picture of South Korea's First Lady
 unhone dakshin korea or ayodhya ke pracheen sampark kaa zikr he, ayodhya ke kaarykram kaa zikr he, tasviir he magar yogi kii ghoshnaaon par koi twit nahin aayaa he
 1992 is coming in the name of 2019, everyone's opinion has been arrived, Prime Minister's opinion has not come
 kya pradhanmantri modi ayodhya jaaenge?tippaniyan Yogi Adityanath has already announced that he will establish the statue of Rama in Ayodhya
 yah ram mandir se alag hoga
 Chief Minister Adityanath said that a medical college will be built in Ayodhya named after Rajarshi Dasharatha and the airport will be named after Purushottam Ram
 hamane bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah kaa twitor handle bhi check kiya
 Faizabad's name has been changed to what they say
 to unke twitor handle par is bare main kuch nahin mila
 He congratulated Union Minister Jitendra Singh on his birthday, but BJP President Amit Shah and Prime Minister Modi did not even tweet at such a big decision of Yogi Adityanath
 raajnneeti ke alaava aaj ke din aapako news channelon ke kawarej ko alag se notice karnaa chahie
 The screen color was also changed
 faizabad kaa rang alag tha, ayodhya ke liye rang alag tha
 The symbols used on the screen need to be understood and cautious
 chaar saal se news channelon par jo hindu muslim topic kaa neshnal silebus chal rahaa tha, wo ab apane puure shabaab par he
 The strips which are written on the screen of TV channels have a color of righteousness on them
 bhayanak tareeke se ekatarfa he
 His tone is something else
 thodaa satark hokar channelon ko dekhne kii zarurat he isse pehle ki kuch bhi dekhne laayak hi na bache
 The rest of you are smart
 ye sab nae badlaav nahin hai magar bahut dinon baad purana daur laut rahaa he to inhen samajhane kii zarurat he
 You do not become an audience just by watching TV, you must also study separately to remain a viewer
 bina padhe aap na to apane darshak hone ko samaj paaenge or na hi tivi ko
 This book is Arvind Rajagopal's book politics after television
 kitaab bahut mahangi he
 You can still read from the library
 internet par peedief farm main maujuud he
 You can understand a lot from the content list of this book and can watch today's news channels
 2014 ke baad ke vidhansabha chunaavon main pradhanmantri modi kaha karte the ki rajya or dilli main ek sarkaar hogi to team kii tarah kaam karegi
 Then when Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath made Faizabad district to Ayodhya then why did not the Prime Minister's tweet come
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kaa koi twit nahin aayaa
 While the Prime Minister was active on his Twitter handle until after Yogi's announcement, he was replying to people's tweets
 kya aaj ke din mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke is bade faisle par badhai nahin deni chahie thi? yaa donon alag alag raaston par chalate hue kisi aghoshit manzil tak pahunchnaa chaahate hai
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has been clear about Ayodhya from the beginning
 pichhali diwali ke pehle bhi vahiin the
 He is also there before this Diwali
 bijepi ne virdohi dalon se to poocha he magar pradhanmantri ne abhi tak apni raay nahin bataai he
 Wait when they leave Vikas or come open in the case of Ram temple along with development
 idhar dilli kisi or chiz main vyast he
 CBI quarrel is on the road, in court
 arabiai kaa jhagada rose sadak par aa rahaa he
 Today the root cause of that quarrel came to light
 indian express kii pehali khabar hi yahi he ki reserve bank ne sarkaar ko 3 lakh 60,000 karod dene se manaa kar diya he
 Last Wednesday itself, the government said that it respects the autonomy of the RBI but both have to work in the public interest according to the needs of the Indian economy
 express ke sanni verma ke is report ne jhagade kii vajah bataa di he
 9 with the Reserve Bank of India
 59 lakh karod kaa reserve he
 3 of it
 6 lakh karod sarplus he
 The government wants this part for itself
 mantralay kaa suzav he ki is sarplus kaa kaise istamaal karnaa he, sarkaar or reserve bank donon milakar tay kar sakate hai
 The existing rules are based on very conservative thinking
 arabiai ke sutron ne reserve bank ko bataaya he ki sarkaar reserve bank ke reserve khazaane main haath lagaana chaahati he
 If this happens, the stability of the macroeconomy will be affected
 arabiai ne is prastaav ko khaarij kar diya
 It is not that the Reserve Bank does not provide the surpluses, except the year of demonetisation, it is usually near 50,000 crore
 lekin sarkaar kii nazar 3 lakh 60 hazaar karod par he
 So that this money can be handed over to the banks which do not have capital and they will start distributing loans again to all
 aapako yaad hoga ki pichley hafte vivaad isi baat ko lekar shuru hua tha jab dipti governor viral acharya ne argentina kaa udhaaharan de diya tha ki vahaan kii sarkaar bhi reserve bank ke khazaane ko hathiyanna chaahati thi, virodh main governor ne istipha diya or vahaan tabaahi aa gai
 But this news of the Express confirms that the rare Acharya was making public the intention of the government on the pretext of Argentina
 janata ko bataa rahe the
 The newspaper wrote that the Reserve Bank made a condition of giving money from its reserve when no government representative was present on its board
 arabiai or sarkaar ke bich is kheenchaatani kaa nateeja kya hoga, kya reserve bank sarkaar ko apana rigerv saunp degaa, uskaa arthvyavastha par kya asar padegaa, kai jaankaar kehete hai ki acha asar nahin padegaa
 Our colleague Himanshu has spoken to Vipin Malik, who has been a member of the board of the Reserve Bank
 vipin malik kehete hai, 'sarkaar kaa ye kahana ki arabiai use apane rigerv main se 2 lakh yaa 3 lakh karod de de
 It cannot be done
 sarkaar ke bajtiy anumaanon main market borowing kaa program tha wo puraa nahin ho paa rahaa he
 11 public sector banks have moved to PCA
 baaki bainkon main nakadi kii killat he
 ' china ke saath yuddh ke samay ek baar reserve bank ke reserve se paisa liya gaya he
 The war was going on then, but there is no other example in this long history
 abhi kya aise halaat hai jab sarkaar kii nazar arabiai ke reserve sarplus par he
 Meanwhile, former Governor Raghuram Rajan has been interviewed
 rajan ne sienbisi channel kii ankar lata venkatesh ji se baat kii he
 Rajan has also endorsed Deputy Governor Viral Acharya in a way that the government should not try to lay hands on the Reserve Bank, it is not good for the economy
 ek baar aapane kisi ko governor or dipti governor niyukt kar diya to aapako unki baat sunani chahie
 Government and RBI respect each other's thinking
 arabiai ko rahul david kii tarah khelnaa hoga, navjot singh siddhu kii tarah nahin
 The country will benefit from an independent and strong RBI
 sarkaar or arabiai ke bich chal rahaa yah takaraav ab or nahin badhanaa chahie
 It is necessary to save the Reserve Bank as a national institution
 agar sarkaar bahut zyaada dabaav detii he to reserve bank ko adhikaar he wo naa kah de
 The government should present its stand with the Reserve Bank but the RBI should decide
 reserve bank ke board kaa kaam duusare hiton kaa bachaav karnaa nahin he balki apane santhaan ke hiton kii raksha karnaa he
 ' ham aapako phir se bataa den ki raghuram rajan ne yah intervyuu sienbisi news channel kii ankar lata venkatesh ko diya he
 But why does the government want to take this money from the Reserve Bank
 china yuddh ke samay ek baar aisa hua tha magar vah yuddh kaa samay tha, uske baad kabhi kisi daur main sarkaar ne reserve bank ke reserve par haath nahin daalaa
 When the government is claiming that tax collection has increased due to GST and income tax then why the government needs this money
 19 november ko reserve bank ke gavarning body kii baithak he
 a lot has to be decided in that meeting
 gaiyr banking vittiya sansthaaen sankat se guzar rahi hai
 You will know that ILFS is in crisis
 isaki kai companiyon ne jo lone liye hai wo chukaaye nahin gaye hai
 These institutions also give further loans by taking loans, so when they are unable to repay their loan then there will be a shortage of money in the market
 ek tarah se haahaakaar much saktaa he
 The market started falling when it was first reported that ILFS was also defaulting
 asocham ke secetry general udai verma bhi ek tarah se sarkaar ke saath khadey nazar aa rahe hai
 Rajan has also made a statement, like Verma, that the Reserve Bank should inject money to overcome the NBFC crisis
 angreji ke akhabaaron main khub lekh chap rahe hai ki rigerv bank swytt to he magar uskaa bos sarkaar he isliye janhit main sarkaar kii baat manani chahie
 Why the Reserve Bank of India is being pressurized for this money suddenly
 yah bhi ek sawaal he
 Before making final opinion read the article of Surjeet Bhalla, Prabhat Patnaik
 kai or logon ne bhi likhe hai
 Now talk about Ayodhya
 elahabaad kaa naam badalane ke baad mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne faizabad zile kaa naam badal diya he
 Earlier Ayodhya used to come in Faizabad district, now it became a district named after Ayodhya
 ram kii nagari ayodhya ko zila kii padavi mili he, ise media ne badi khabar ke rup main dikhaaya he
 There is already an assembly seat called Ayodhya
 loksabhaa kaa naam faizabad he
 Will the name of the Lok Sabha constituency be changed along with this or will the parliamentary constituency be called Faizabad
 bijepi ke hi lallu singh faizabad se saansad hai
 Our colleague Pramod Srivastava from Faizabad told that Prime Minister Modi had gone to Faizabad in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, not to Ayodhya
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main faizabad bhi nahin gaye, ayodhya bhi nahin gaye
 BJP has its own MLA from Ayodhya assembly seat
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath 7 baar ayodhya or 3 baar faizabad ja chuke hai
 The question is when will Prime Minister Modi visit Ayodhya, when will he speak on the Babri Masjid demolition and the Ram temple issue
 jo bhi he itani badi ghoshnaa ho gai he or shaam chah baje se lekar raat ke nau baje tak yani jab prime time shuru hua tab tak pradhanmantri or amit shah kaa koi twit nahin aayaa
 Both did not congratulate Yogi Adityanath with this big announcement
 aisa nahin he ki pradhanmantri modi ne ayodhya par twit nahin kiya he, 6 bajkar 40 minute par unka twit aayaa he jisamen dakshin korea kii first ladi kii tasviir he
 He mentions ancient contacts between South Korea and Ayodhya, refers to Ayodhya's program, photo but no tweet has come on Yogi's declarations
 2019 ke naam par 1992 aa rahaa he, sabaki raay aa chuki he, pradhanmantri kii raay nahin ai he
 Will Prime Minister Modi visit Ayodhya? Comments yogi adityanath pehle hi elaan kar chuke hai ki ayodhya main ram kii pratimaa kaayam karenge
 It will be different from the Ram temple
 mukhyamantri adityanath ne kaha ki ayodhya main ek medical kalege banegaa jiskaa naam rajarshi dasharath par hoga or airport kaa naam purushottam ram ke naam par hoga
 We also checked the Twitter handle of BJP national president Amit Shah
 faizabad kaa naam badla gaya he us par ve kya kehete hai
 So nothing was found on his Twitter handle
 unhone kendriya mantri jitendra singh ko janmdin par badhai di he magar yogi adityanath ke itane bade faisle par bijepi ke adhyaksh amit shah or pradhanmantri modi ne koi twit tak nahin kiya
 Apart from politics, today you should notice the coverage of news channels separately
 screen kaa rang tak badal gaya tha
 Faizabad had a different color, Ayodhya had a different color
 screen par jin pratikon kaa istamaal ho rahaa tha, use samajhane or satark hone kii zarurat he
 For four years, the national syllabus of the Hindu Muslim topic which was running on the news channels, is now in full swing
 tivi channelon ke parde par jo pattiyaan likhi hui aa rahi hai, un par dharmikata kaa rang he
 Is unilaterally in a terrible way
 unka tone kuch or he
 There is a need to watch the channels with some caution before nothing remains to be seen
 baaki aap samajhadaar hai
 These are not all new changes, but after a long time the old phase is returning, so they need to be understood
 sirf tivi dekhne se aap darshak nahin ho jate hai, darshak bane rahane ke liye alag se padhanaa bhi chahie
 Without reading, you will neither understand your audience nor your television
 yah kitaab he arvind rajagopal kii kitaab politics after television pard sakate hai
 The book is very expensive
 phir bhi aap librari se lekar pard sakate hai
 Exists in PDF form on the Internet
 is kitaab kii vishay suchi se hi aap bahut kuch samaj sakate hai or aaj ke news channelon ko dekh sakate hai
 The first news of the Indian Express is that the Reserve Bank has refused to give 3 lakh 60,000 crore to the government
 pichley buudhvaar ko hi sarkaar ne kaha tha ki vah arabiai kii swaittata kaa sammaan karti he lekin donon ko bhartiya arthvyavastha kii zaruuraton ke hisaab se janhit main kaam karnaa hoga
 This report by Sunny Verma of Express has given the reason for the quarrel
 bhartiya reserve bank ke paas 9
 There is a reserve of 59 lakh crores
 isamen se 3
 6 lakh crore is surplus
 sarkaar yahi hissaa apane liye chaahati he
 The Ministry suggests that both the government and the Reserve Bank can decide jointly how to use this surplus
 maujuuda jo niyam hai wo behad rudhiwaadi soch ke aadhaar par banaae gaye hai
 Sources in the RBI have told the Reserve Bank that the government wants to join the Reserve Bank's Reserve Treasury
 aisa hoga to vyapak arthvyavastha kii sthirataa par asar padegaa
 The RBI rejected the proposal
 aisa nahin he ki reserve bank saraples nahin detaa he, notebandi ke saal ko chhod den to aam taur par yah 50,000 karod ke paas hota hi he
 But the government is eyeing 3 lakh 60 thousand crores
 taaki is paise ko un bainkon ke hawaale kiya ja sake jinke paas puunji nahin he or ve aage phir se sabko lone baantne lagen
 You may remember that the controversy started last week when Deputy Governor Viral Acharya gave the example of Argentina that the government there also wanted to take over the treasury of the Reserve Bank, in protest the governor resigned and there was devastation
 Has gone
 lekin express kii is khabar se isaki pushti hoti he ki viral acharya argentina ke bahaane sarkaar ke iraade ko hi public kar rahe the
 Was telling the public
 akhbaar ne likhaa he ki apane reserve se paisa dene kii shart reserve bank ne tab kar liya jab sarkaar kaa koi numaayinda uske board main maujuud nahin tha
 What will be the result of this tussle between the RBI and the government, whether the Reserve Bank will hand over its reserves to the government, what effect it will have on the economy, many experts say that will not have a good effect
 hamaare sahyogi himanshu ne vipin malik se baat kii he jo reserve bank ke board ke sadsy rahe hai
 Says Vipin Malik, 'the government says that the RBI should give it 2 lakh or 3 lakh crore out of its reserve
 ye nahin ho saktaa he
 In the budgetary estimates of the government, the market borrowing program was not being completed
 11 saarvajanik kshetra ke bank pisie main chale gaye hai
 The rest of the banks have a cash crunch
 ' Money has been taken from the Reserve Bank's Reserve once during the war with China
 tab to yuddh chal rahaa tha lekin lambey samay ke itihaas main iske alaava doosraa udhaaharan nahin he
 What are the circumstances now when the government is eyeing rbi's Reserve Surplus
 is bich purv governor raghuram rajan kaa intervyuu aayaa he
 Rajan has spoken to CNBC channel anchor Lata Venkatesh ji
 rajan ne bhi dipti governor viral aacharya kii baat kaa ek tarah se samarthan kiya he ki sarkaar ko reserve bank par haath daalane kaa prayaas nahin karnaa chahie, yah arthvyavastha ke liye acha nahin he
 Once you have appointed someone as governor and deputy governor, you should listen to them
 sarkaar or arabiai ek duusari kii soch kaa sammaan karen
 RBI will have to play like Rahul Dravid and not like Navjot Singh Sidhu
 swatantra or majboot arabiai se desh ko phayda hoga
 This ongoing confrontation between the government and the RBI should not escalate anymore
 rashtriya sanstha ke rup main rigerv bank ko bachaana zaruri he
 If the government gives too much pressure, then the Reserve Bank has the right to say no
 sarkaar reserve bank ke paas apana paksh rakhe lekin faisla arabiai kare
 The job of the Reserve Bank's board is not to defend other interests but to protect the interests of its institution
 ' Let us tell you again that Raghuram Rajan has given this interview to CNBC News Channel anchor Lata Venkatesh
 lekin sarkaar kyon reserve bank se yah paisa lenaa chaahati he
 It happened once during the China War but it was the time of the war, never did the government hand over the reserve of the Reserve Bank after that
 sarkaar jab daawa kar rahi ho ki jiesti or inakam tex se kar sangrah bad gaya he tab kyon sarkaar ko is paise kii zarurat he
 There is a meeting of the governing body of the Reserve Bank on 19 November
 us baithak main kaaphi kuch tay hona he
 Non-banking financial institutions are going through a crisis
 aapako pataa hi hoga ki lephes sankat main he
 The loans taken by many of its companies have not been repaid
 yah sansthaaen bhi lone lekar aage lone detii hai lihaaza jab yah apana lone nahin chukaa paaengi to bazaar main paise kii kami ho jaaegi
 In a way, there can be chaos
 jab pehali baar yah khabar ai thi ki lephes bhi difolt karne lagi he tab bazaar girane laga tha
 Assocham secretary general Uday Verma is also seen standing with the government in a way
 rajan ne bhi verma kii tarah bayaan diya he ki reserve bank ko enbiensi ke sankat ko dur karne ke liye paisa daalana chahie
 There are a lot of articles published in English newspapers that the Reserve Bank is autonomous but its boss is the government, so the government should be obeyed in the public interest
 kyon achaanak is paise ke liye rigerv bank par janhit kaa dabaav daalaa ja rahaa he
 This is also a question
 antim raay banane se pehle surajeet bhalla, prabhaat patnayak ke lekh ko padhie

 ab baat ayodhya kii
 After renaming Allahabad, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has changed the name of Faizabad district
 pehle ayodhya faizabad zile main aata tha, ab ayodhya ke naam kaa jila ho gaya
 Ayodhya, the city of Ram, has got the title of district, this has been shown by the media as big news
 ayodhya ke naam se vidhansabha seat pehle se he
 The name of the Lok Sabha is Faizabad
 kya isi ke saath loksabhaa kshetra kaa naam bhi badal jayega yaa sansadeey kshetra faizabad hi kehalaayegaa
 Lallu Singh of BJP is an MP from Faizabad
 faizabad se hamaare sahyogi pramod shrivastav ne bataaya ki pradhanmantri modi 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main faizabad gaye the, ayodhya nahin gaye the
 Faizabad did not even go to Ayodhya in the 2017 assembly elections
 ayodhya vidhansabha seat se bijepi ke hi vidhayak hai
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has visited Ayodhya 7 times and Faizabad 3 times
 sawaal he pradhanmantri modi ayodhya kab jaaenge, babari masjid dhwans or ram mandir ke masale par kab bolenge
 Whatever it is, such a big announcement has been made and no tweet came from the Prime Minister and Amit Shah from 6 pm to 9 pm, when the prime time started
 is bade elaan ke saath donon ne yogi adityanath ko badhai nahin di
 It is not that Prime Minister Modi has not tweeted on Ayodhya, his tweet has come at 6
40 AM which has a picture of South Korea's First Lady
 unhone dakshin korea or ayodhya ke pracheen sampark kaa zikr he, ayodhya ke kaarykram kaa zikr he, tasviir he magar yogi kii ghoshnaaon par koi twit nahin aayaa he
 1992 is coming in the name of 2019, everyone's opinion has been arrived, Prime Minister's opinion has not come
 kya pradhanmantri modi ayodhya jaaenge?tippaniyan Yogi Adityanath has already announced that he will establish the statue of Rama in Ayodhya
 yah ram mandir se alag hoga
 Chief Minister Adityanath said that a medical college will be built in Ayodhya named after Rajarshi Dasharatha and the airport will be named after Purushottam Ram
 hamane bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah kaa twitor handle bhi check kiya
 Faizabad's name has been changed to what they say
 to unke twitor handle par is bare main kuch nahin mila
 He congratulated Union Minister Jitendra Singh on his birthday, but BJP President Amit Shah and Prime Minister Modi did not even tweet at such a big decision of Yogi Adityanath
 raajnneeti ke alaava aaj ke din aapako news channelon ke kawarej ko alag se notice karnaa chahie
 The screen color was also changed
 faizabad kaa rang alag tha, ayodhya ke liye rang alag tha
 The symbols used on the screen need to be understood and cautious
 chaar saal se news channelon par jo hindu muslim topic kaa neshnal silebus chal rahaa tha, wo ab apane puure shabaab par he
 The strips which are written on the screen of TV channels have a color of righteousness on them
 bhayanak tareeke se ekatarfa he
 His tone is something else
 thodaa satark hokar channelon ko dekhne kii zarurat he isse pehle ki kuch bhi dekhne laayak hi na bache
 The rest of you are smart
 ye sab nae badlaav nahin hai magar bahut dinon baad purana daur laut rahaa he to inhen samajhane kii zarurat he

 Earlier Ayodhya used to come in Faizabad district, now it became a district named after Ayodhya
 ram kii nagari ayodhya ko zila kii padavi mili he, ise media ne badi khabar ke rup main dikhaaya he
 There is already an assembly seat called Ayodhya

 BJP has its own MLA from Ayodhya assembly seat
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath 7 baar ayodhya or 3 baar faizabad ja chuke hai
 The question is when will Prime Minister Modi visit Ayodhya, when will he speak on the Babri Masjid demolition and the Ram temple issue

 We also checked the Twitter handle of BJP national president Amit Shah

 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has visited Ayodhya 7 times and Faizabad 3 times

 The screen color was also changed
 faizabad kaa rang alag tha, ayodhya ke liye rang alag tha
 The symbols used on the screen need to be understood and cautious

 But why does the government want to take this money from the Reserve Bank
 china yuddh ke samay ek baar aisa hua tha magar vah yuddh kaa samay tha, uske baad kabhi kisi daur main sarkaar ne reserve bank ke reserve par haath nahin daalaa
 When the government is claiming that tax collection has increased due to GST and income tax then why the government needs this money
 19 november ko reserve bank ke gavarning body kii baithak he
 a lot has to be decided in that meeting
 gaiyr banking vittiya sansthaaen sankat se guzar rahi hai
 You will know that ILFS is in crisis
 isaki kai companiyon ne jo lone liye hai wo chukaaye nahin gaye hai
 These institutions also give further loans by taking loans, so when they are unable to repay their loan then there will be a shortage of money in the market
 ek tarah se haahaakaar much saktaa he
 The market started falling when it was first reported that ILFS was also defaulting
 asocham ke secetry general udai verma bhi ek tarah se sarkaar ke saath khadey nazar aa rahe hai
 Rajan has also made a statement, like Verma, that the Reserve Bank should inject money to overcome the NBFC crisis
 angreji ke akhabaaron main khub lekh chap rahe hai ki rigerv bank swytt to he magar uskaa bos sarkaar he isliye janhit main sarkaar kii baat manani chahie
 Why the Reserve Bank of India is being pressurized for this money suddenly
 yah bhi ek sawaal he
 Before making final opinion read the article of Surjeet Bhalla, Prabhat Patnaik
 kai or logon ne bhi likhe hai
 Now talk about Ayodhya
 elahabaad kaa naam badalane ke baad mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne faizabad zile kaa naam badal diya he
 Earlier Ayodhya used to come in Faizabad district, now it became a district named after Ayodhya
 ram kii nagari ayodhya ko zila kii padavi mili he, ise media ne badi khabar ke rup main dikhaaya he
 There is already an assembly seat called Ayodhya
 loksabhaa kaa naam faizabad he
 Will the name of the Lok Sabha constituency be changed along with this or will the parliamentary constituency be called Faizabad
 bijepi ke hi lallu singh faizabad se saansad hai
 Our colleague Pramod Srivastava from Faizabad told that Prime Minister Modi had gone to Faizabad in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, not to Ayodhya
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main faizabad bhi nahin gaye, ayodhya bhi nahin gaye
 BJP has its own MLA from Ayodhya assembly seat
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath 7 baar ayodhya or 3 baar faizabad ja chuke hai
 The question is when will Prime Minister Modi visit Ayodhya, when will he speak on the Babri Masjid demolition and the Ram temple issue
 jo bhi he itani badi ghoshnaa ho gai he or shaam chah baje se lekar raat ke nau baje tak yani jab prime time shuru hua tab tak pradhanmantri or amit shah kaa koi twit nahin aayaa
 Both did not congratulate Yogi Adityanath with this big announcement
 aisa nahin he ki pradhanmantri modi ne ayodhya par twit nahin kiya he, 6 bajkar 40 minute par unka twit aayaa he jisamen dakshin korea kii first ladi kii tasviir he
 He mentions ancient contacts between South Korea and Ayodhya, refers to Ayodhya's program, photo but no tweet has come on Yogi's declarations
 2019 ke naam par 1992 aa rahaa he, sabaki raay aa chuki he, pradhanmantri kii raay nahin ai he
 Will Prime Minister Modi visit Ayodhya? Comments yogi adityanath pehle hi elaan kar chuke hai ki ayodhya main ram kii pratimaa kaayam karenge
 It will be different from the Ram temple
 mukhyamantri adityanath ne kaha ki ayodhya main ek medical kalege banegaa jiskaa naam rajarshi dasharath par hoga or airport kaa naam purushottam ram ke naam par hoga
 We also checked the Twitter handle of BJP national president Amit Shah
 faizabad kaa naam badla gaya he us par ve kya kehete hai
 So nothing was found on his Twitter handle
 unhone kendriya mantri jitendra singh ko janmdin par badhai di he magar yogi adityanath ke itane bade faisle par bijepi ke adhyaksh amit shah or pradhanmantri modi ne koi twit tak nahin kiya
 Apart from politics, today you should notice the coverage of news channels separately
 screen kaa rang tak badal gaya tha
 Faizabad had a different color, Ayodhya had a different color
 screen par jin pratikon kaa istamaal ho rahaa tha, use samajhane or satark hone kii zarurat he
 For four years, the national syllabus of the Hindu Muslim topic which was running on the news channels, is now in full swing
 tivi channelon ke parde par jo pattiyaan likhi hui aa rahi hai, un par dharmikata kaa rang he
 Is unilaterally in a terrible way
 unka tone kuch or he
 There is a need to watch the channels with some caution before nothing remains to be seen
 baaki aap samajhadaar hai
 These are not all new changes, but after a long time the old phase is returning, so they need to be understood
 sirf tivi dekhne se aap darshak nahin ho jate hai, darshak bane rahane ke liye alag se padhanaa bhi chahie
 Without reading, you will neither understand your audience nor your television
 yah kitaab he arvind rajagopal kii kitaab politics after television pard sakate hai
 The book is very expensive
 phir bhi aap librari se lekar pard sakate hai
 Exists in PDF form on the Internet

 There is a meeting of the governing body of the Reserve Bank on 19 November
 us baithak main kaaphi kuch tay hona he
 Non-banking financial institutions are going through a crisis
 aapako pataa hi hoga ki lephes sankat main he
 The loans taken by many of its companies have not been repaid
 yah sansthaaen bhi lone lekar aage lone detii hai lihaaza jab yah apana lone nahin chukaa paaengi to bazaar main paise kii kami ho jaaegi
 In a way, there can be chaos
 jab pehali baar yah khabar ai thi ki lephes bhi difolt karne lagi he tab bazaar girane laga tha
 Assocham secretary general Uday Verma is also seen standing with the government in a way
 rajan ne bhi verma kii tarah bayaan diya he ki reserve bank ko enbiensi ke sankat ko dur karne ke liye paisa daalana chahie
 There are a lot of articles published in English newspapers that the Reserve Bank is autonomous but its boss is the government, so the government should be obeyed in the public interest
 kyon achaanak is paise ke liye rigerv bank par janhit kaa dabaav daalaa ja rahaa he
 This is also a question
 antim raay banane se pehle surajeet bhalla, prabhaat patnayak ke lekh ko padhie

 supreme court ke pradhan nyaayadhish justise ranjan gogoi 17 november ko ritair ho jaaenge or unki jagah par 18 november ko justise sharad arvindabobade bharat ke nae pradhan nyaayadhish ban jaaenge
 But in these 10 days, Justice Gogoi has to pronounce many such decisions which will change a lot in India or the impact of these decisions can be quite 'effective'
 jab ham november maheene main aane vaale supreme court ke faislon kii baat karte hai to sabase pehle dimag main ayodhya vivaad aata he
 The hearing in the case is over and Justice Gogoi had said long ago that if the hearing on it is completed within the stipulated time, he can give a decision on it in November
 ayodhya vivaad 100 saalon se zyada purana he
 While the Supreme Court was hearing about the ownership of the disputed land, it has become the biggest question of faith for the general public
 is vivaad ko lekar kai partiyaan satta ke sheersh tak pahunchi to kai aisi bhi partiyaan raheen jo hinduvadi raajnneeti ke ubhaar main apni jameen kho baithi

 At a time when the Congress party has lost badly in the Lok Sabha elections at the national level, Kerala is the state that still stands firmly with this oldest party in the country
 yahaan par loksabhaa kii 20 siten hai, inamen se congress kii aguai vaale udief gathbandhan ne 19 siten jeet lee hai
 The Congress itself contested 16 seats and won 15
 rajya main sattarudh left gathbandhan ke liye yah jhatka he ki janata ne unhen mahaj ek seat par samet diya
 This election result will also impact the CPI and CPM national party status
 bijepi kii aguai vaale endie gathbandhan kaa yahaan phir ek baar khaataa nahin khul sakaa
 After the voting ended on May 19 across the country, India Today and Axis My India released estimates of their exit poll survey
 is survey main kaha gaya tha ki rajya main congress gathbandhan ekatarfa pradarshan karte hue 15-16 tak siten jeet saktaa he, ldf gathbandhan 3-5 siton par simat saktaa he or bijepi ke liye khaataa kholana bhi mushkil hoga
 Our guess came true with little change
 udief ko 2014 main yahaan se 12 siten mili thim jo is chunaav main badhkar 19 ho gayi, jabaki ldf yani left gathbandhan ko yahaan jabardast jhatka laga or vah 8 siton se simat kar 1 seat par aa gaya
 The BJP failed to open its account in the state
 survey main kaha gaya tha ki tiruvanantpuram loksabhaa seat bijepi ladaai main he, jahaan par uskaa khaataa khulne kii thodi si ummid kii ja sakati he, vahaan par vah duusare number par rahi
 This is the only seat in the entire state where the BJP could achieve the feat of being second
 india today or exis maai india kaa aankada kahata he ki rajya main jitne vot pade, udief ko uskaa kul 47% vot hasil hua, jabaki ldf 35%voton ke saath duusare number par rahaa
 The NDA coalition has received a total of 16% votes across the state
 anya dalon evam pratyaashiyon ko 2% vot mili hai
 Surveys by India Today and Axis My India show that the UDF is the most preferred coalition in the state even on religious grounds
 38% hindu matadaataaon ne udief or ldf ko vot diya he, jabaki bijepi sabarimala maamle ko khub hawa dekar bhi bahusankhyak matadaataaon ke mahaj21% vot hi hasil kar pai
 58% of Muslim and 56% of Christian voters supported the UDF
 in donon samudaayon se 31% or 30% matadaataaon ne left gathbandhan kaa samarthan kiya
 The BJP got only 8% votes from the Muslim community and only 11% from the Christian community
 haalanki, ldf ko anya samudaayon se 44% vot mili, jabaki udief ko anya samudaayon se 29% or endie ko 26% vot mili
 If the attitude of the voters on the basis of economic classification is seen, then the UDF is also the first choice of the rich class
 sabhi aarthik varg ke 44% se zyada voters ne congress gathbandhan ko vot kiya he
 The Congress supported 55% of the families with more than 31,000 income groups
 yah dilachasp he ki masik aay kaa str badhane ke saath ldf kaa vot share ghat rahaa he
 38% of the voters below the poverty line vote LDF
 lekin 31,000aay varg tak ke voters ke bich ldf kaa samarthan 20% tak kam ho gaya
 The BJP is backed by 16% of voters from BPL families to 20,000 income groups, but it has 21% support among families with higher income groups
 udief ashikshit or shikshit donon tarah ke matadaataaon main sabase zyada prabhaav vaala gathbandhan he
 UDF supports 46% — 48% of all educational categories
 ldf ko ashikshit varg ke 40% or aathvin tak shikshit varg ke 37% voters kaa samarthan hasil he
 Further as the level of education increases, 10th, 12th, graduation and post graduation, LDF support is 34%, 35%, 33% and 30% respectively
 aankadon ke mutabik, jaise-jaise zyada shaikshit str kii ore badhate hai, vaise-vaise bijepi ke samarthakon kii sankhya bhi badhati he
 Even if based on the age of the voters, the Congress is the first choice of voters of all age groups
 pehali baar vot dene ja rahe (18-25 saal ke) matadaataaon se lekar 61 saal yaa usase zyada kii umr ke voters kii baat karen to congress ko sabhi varg se ausatan 47% kaa samarthan hasil he
 Congress is the choice of 48% of the 26-35 year old voters, then the support of the Congress decreases to 45% among voters older than that
 ldf ko 39%first time voters kaa saport hasil he to isse zyada umr vaale 38% voters kaa samarthan hasil he
 LDF support in the 36–50 age group is down to 33%
 bijepi ko 36-50 or 51-60 se ayuvarg ke 17% matadaataaon kaa samarthan hasil he
 Surveys by India Today and Axis My India say that BJP is the choice of just 13% of the voters going to vote for the first time
 survey main yah bhi gaur kiya gaya he ki kerala main vibhinn vyavsaayon se jude logon kaa raajnneetik rujhaan kaisaa he
 UDF and LDF support stands at 43% and 42% among students, 41% –40% among farmers and 46% –44% among unemployed voters
 yani in virgon ke bich donon gathbandhanon main kadaa muqabla he
 The UDF is more than 10% popular among domestic women, agricultural laborers, rickshaw pullers and small shopkeepers as compared to LDF

 sarkari naukari se jude logon main rajya main sattarudh ldf kaa samarthan zyada he
 50% of government employees support LDF, while UDF is backed by 34% and BJP 13%
 haalanki, varking class ke profeshnal matadaataaon main 46% samarthan ke saath udief aage he, lekin is varg ke matadaataaon main bijepi ne jabardast ghuspaith banaai he or ldf kaa nuksaan kiya he
 The UDF has more than 10% support among private sector, business and retired people as compared to LDF
 haalanki, kerala jaise rajya main shahari or gramin kshetra ko paribhaashit karnaa behad kathin he, lekin udief donon hi tarah ke ilaakon main aage he
 UDF has 48% support in rural areas and LDF 35%, UDF 46% and LDF 35% in urban areas
 endie ko shahari kshetra main 18% voters kaa samarthan he jo gramin kshetra main ise mil rahe samarthan se 3% zyada he
 If we talk about male voters then UDF got 48% and LDF got 33% male voters
 haalanki, mahila matadaataaon main ldf kaa samarthan 3% zyada he, lekin is varg main bhi 45% vot share ke saath udief badhat banaae hue he
 The NDA has the support of 16% of voters from both male and female sections

 sachiv (aarthik maamlat) aar gopaalan ne vishwa bank vikaas samiti kii baithak ko sambodhit karte hue yah baat kahi
 He said that steps need to be taken to increase the credit limits as India and other developing countries are not able to utilize the resources of World Bank much
 unhone kaha ki vishwa bank ko krishi kshetra main or nivesh karnaa chahie

 Tackling the declining economy of separate suramerica on the issue of outsourcing has been a major challenge for Barack Obama
