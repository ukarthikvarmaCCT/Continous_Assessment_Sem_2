 In the first part, the city of Mirzapur, the story of the series and other things can be read by clicking here) (in the second part of the review, click here and read Kis Kis Won in acting
 
 
 
 ) Mirzapur could have been a good story
 lekin reality ke naam par sex, vaayalence or kai basir pair kii baaten niraash karti hai
 Localism, the language of the characters, the dress and the locales were not given much attention
 kahani ke mood main tamaam chizon kaa na hona niraash karata he
 However a cinema or series has its own compulsions
 film or siries kaa nirmaan bhi ek ek vyapak darshak varg ke liye kiya jaataa he
 But when the web series is allowed to show things more realistically, then why should it be unnecessarily included in the adult scenes? Isn't it good that many other things would come up in their original form
 "mirzapur" main deshkal bahut spasht nahin he
 The first thing is that Bahubali forces are dominated in Mirzapur city, but not so unbridled as shown in the series
 yah bhi saafe kar dena chahie ki siries ek kaalpanik kahani par aadhaarit he
 The unbridled crime and all the things in Mirzapur are not the same as shown
 kahani main kai jagah bade bade jerk hai
 What was shown about the entry of SP Maurya's character is beyond comprehension
 ye swaabhaavik si baat he ki jis mafia ko vahaan ke rajya kii satta (siem, yadavaji protection ke liye paisa lete hai) kaa varadahast praapt hoga, bhala vahaan uski marji ke khilaaf kisi afasar kii niyukti kaise kii ja sakati he? or bhala kaaleen bhaiya jaise mafia ke ilaake main koi afasar aata he to wo uske khilaaf itnaa aakraamak kaise ho saktaa he
 It is shown in the series that SP Maurya forms a special team for the encounter in the city
 pehla atake guddu or bablu par hota he
 Because of this, both have to leave the city and be grounded
 lekin achaanak donon mirzapur waapas laut aate hai
 After returning, we roam the city as if nothing has happened
 donon kaa is tarah lautnaa kahani main ek bikharaav kii tarah he
 Just as the series progresses, the character of Ramakant Pandit (rajesh Telang) becomes redundant
 jaise kaaleen bhaiya, jo he to bahubali par netaa ji ke aage uskaa kirdaar kanfusion kaa shikaar he
 Can a powerful Bahubali like Carpet Bhaiya in Purvanchal in reality be so forced in front of an MLA? People would not have heard about such stories
 tigmanshu dhulia ke nirdesan main "sahib bivi or gangster" main netaaon ke aage mafiaon kaa khaskar jimmy shergill or irfan kaa charitra laajawab tha
 He is buried in Mirzapur
 secred games se tulana kare to kahani main bematlab kii chijen mirzapur ko ek saadhaaran web siries bana detii he
 If it is so, it is the responsibility of the directors
 lekhak ne jis tarah se kirdaaron ko gadha vah apane mul swaroop main aage bad hi nahin paaya
 It surprises me
 kahaniyon main deshkal kaa dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie tha
 Mirzapur's fictional story seems to lack it
 kai chijen bina jarurat ke thuns di gai hai
 The carpet story is mentioned in the entire story, but in reality it is not visible anywhere
 dikhataa he to karpet kii aad main katton kaa kaarobaar
 Whereas Carpet is a business in Purvanchal consisting of almost non-mafia
 mirzapur samet purvanchal ke tamaam anchalon main mafiaon ke mukhya kaam protection ke badale phiroti, koyala supplai, petrol pump, lokanirmaan vibhaag ke theke, rail or ret kii thekedaari, pahaado par mining or it bhatton jaise kaarobaar hai
 Mafia is involved in illegal trade of liquor contracts, cannabis and opium peel in place of opium
 iskaa ek puraa network he
 Are there such Brahmin families? The way the Brahmin mafias have been shown in Mirzapur, in reality they are not seen by Mirzapur
 udhaaharan ke liye mirzapur main aisa brahman parivaar dhundhna mushkil he jinke ghar main mahilaayein khaane kii teble par nonvej sarv karti hon
 In terms of language and dialogue, "sh" to "sh" in pronunciation is not the only way to capture localism
 sanvaadon main gaaliyon kii bharmaar he, jabaki kai gaaliyaan mirzapur or purvanchal kii hai hi nahin
 The dialogues of the series also do not show the kind of feeling that can be felt anywhere while traveling to Mirzapur
 lokation bhi mirzapur ke nahin lagate
 Cinematography is also simple
 kai jagah lagata he ki siries ko masaaledaar banane ke liye sex or hinsa ke seen jabardastee thuns die gaye hai
 The filming of Bina, who appears depressed with her husband in bed again and again, is beyond comprehension of Radhia being trampled by Munna
 sabase badi baat mirzapur kii pahchaan vindhyachal se he wo siries ke 9 episod main kahin dikhataa hi nahin
 Neither the markets of Mirzapur are visible nor the struggle of the carpet industry
 hinsa ke kai seen daraavne hai jo dekhne laayak nahin hai
 While many scenes look fake
 katton kii factory or kaarobaar kaa kahani main jis tarah zikr he wo utana bhavy dikhataa nahin
 Web series in the blind race What happened in some recent films and web series on the scenes of sex and violence, now it is being seen in every other series
 mirzapur main bhi librari main masterbation kaa bematlab seen rakhaa gaya he
 This scene has nothing to do with the character's personality
 aapako bataa den ki bhartiya raajnneetik siddhantkaar, lekhak or dalit adhikaron ke pairokaar ilaiya ko haal hi main jaan se maarane kii dhamkee mili he
 Ilaiya writes in English as well as Telugu language
 jati ke prakhar virdohi ilaiya daliton ko angreji shiksha ke pairokaar hai

 Singer Shruti Pathak is standing on stage at the Horde Rock Cafe in Mumbai, holding a microphone in her hand
 upar erik flapton, bono, gym morrison or madona ke dheron poster latak rahe hai
 He is accompanied by Glenn Fernandez and Akashdeep Gogoi on guitar, Nawaz Hussain on drums, Andrew Ferrao on keyboards and Shahrukh Khan on sarangi
 yah drishy sangeet ke aam kaaryakramon se alag nahin he, sivaa iske ki shruti yahaan ghazal gane ke liye ai hai
 As she announces Jagjit Singh's ghazals, fans happily wave their phones in the air
 ab desh kii rajdhani kii baat karte hai
 Singer Rashmi Aggarwal has her own style of Ghazal singing
 gajalon kii malikaa begum akhtar kii shagird shanti hiranand kii chhatrachhaaya main ghazal gayikee kii baarikiyaan seekhney vaali rashmi jaij kii madhur dhunon par ghazal ke lakrajon ko pirone ke liye taiyaar hai
 Firaq Gorakhpuri's composition Raat Bhi, Sleep Bhi, Kahani is also based on the beautiful jazz music of Alex Fernandez
 isaki dhun nora jones ke sangeet kii yaad dilaati he
 On the other hand, Tausif Akhtar's new genre "ghazalav" has a mixture of Ghazal and Celtic folk music
 ashish jha, maanas kumaar or sanjoy das jaise bhartiya sangeetkaaron ke saath jagajeet singh ke shagird akhtar wales ke mashhoor gayak gueneth glin or harp vadak georgia ruth ko apana jodidar maanate hai
 Akhtar says, "both styles are based on romantic poetry, so they have many similarities
 ”saaj main badlaavyah dekhte hue ki gajalon kaa daur utaar par he, ye teenon kalakaar apane sangeet ko nae jamaane ke hisaab se badal rahe hai
 Jagjit Singh and Chitra Singh made ghazals popular in the 1970s when they were on the verge of extinction, making their singing easier and easier with the use of Western instruments
 cinema main gajalon par pashchimi sangeet kaa prabhaav bhale rahaa ho, lekin yah jagajeet singh hi the, jinhen ghazal gayaki main pashchimi vaadyayantron ke istemaal kaa shrey diya jaataa he
 The instruments he used included the saxophone, bass, and guitar
 uske baad se ghazal ke kai avatar dekhne ko mili hai, jinamein hariharan kaa urdu bluej or ab akhtar kaa gajalav bhi shaamil he
 Akhtar's latest album Ishq Karo also shows a beautiful synergy of Western music with Ghazals
 rashmi agarwal bhi ghazal gayaki main prayog karnaa pasand karti hai
 In her earlier experiments where Kathak dancer Vibha Lal used to be juggled and composed compositions of Sufi and devout poets, she is now working on a mix of jazz and traditional Ghazal music
 ve kahati hai, “misaal ke liye wo humsafar tha ke gane main main ek sher gaati hum or phir elex piano par bilkul vaisaa hi jaij sangeet bajaate hai, jisase sur or sangeet kaa laajawab talmail ban jaataa he
 The group of jazz musicians is called the Jade Factor
 akhtar ne apni gajalav vidha ke saath kuch aisa hi kamaal kar dikhaaya he
 His programs have been held in many cities of Britain and India
 unka pehla album sitambar 2015 main puri duniya main relies kiya gaya
 Tradition of traditional style of Asgazal on Mahfil is becoming increasingly less popular, it is being eaten by new age Ghazal singers
 mashhoor ghazal gayak talat ajij kehete hai ki unke sangeet kaarykram kaaphi vyast hote hai, lekin ye kaarykram uttar pradesh, goa, guwahati yaa kalikat ke chote shaharon main hi yojit hote hai
 Regarding a program in Delhi, Rashmi says with great dismay that even though the number of ghazal enthusiasts in the city is still significant, the old custom of Mahafils is decreasing
 unki guru shanti hiraanandji kaa bhi aisa maananaa he
 She says, "the past is no longer the era
 meraa vishwaas he ki ghazal ko jab paaramparik style main gaaya jaataa he, tabhi lafjon ke sahi myne nikal pate hai or ghazal kii khubsuurati ubhartee he, lekin kuch logon kaa kahana he ki ghazal gayaki ko jinda rakhane ke liye badlaav jaruri hai
 "perhaps that is why the efforts of Shruti Pathak are being appreciated
 gajalar kii unki avadharana main sirf jugalbandi ke liye pashchimi vaadyayantron ko shaamil karnaa bhar nahin he, balki unki yah koshish paaramparik mehphilon ke daur kii vaapasi kii bhi ummid jagaati he
 His concerts at hard cafes may not be regular, but his youtube shows are popular
 sho ke set par ve paaramparik kalinon or masandon kii jagah aadhunik saaj-sajja ko tarjeeh detii hai, jisamen khubasurat furniture or wintage fremon kaa istemaal hota he
 In the background there is a gramophone and a broom
 mar jaavaan or shubharambh jaise gaanon se mashhoor shruti kahati hai, “gajalar meri jindagi main tab aayaa jab main parshv gayan se hatakar kuch alag karnaa chaahati thi
 "he believes that only by mixing new-age music in Ghazal can it be made interesting to the youth
 dilli ke naser harwani apni mehfil main ghazal shuru karne se pehle uske raag ke bare main bataate hai
 Nasser, the son of freedom fighter and former Lok Sabha MP Ansar Harwani, and Javed Akhtar's maternal brother, often translate the lion into English, making the audience understand the ghazal easily and appreciate his style
 muhabbat ke alaava bheerashmi kaa maananaa he ki pashchimi sangeet kaa istemaal karne ke alaava jagajeet singh ne gajalon ko isliye bhi lokapriy bana diya tha ki ve hameshaa saral or aasaani se samaj main aane vaali gajalon kaa chunaav karte the
 She says that it was due to Jagjit Singh that the Ghazals began to enchant large numbers of people in the '70s and' 80s after the era of Begum Akhtar and Mehdi Hasan
 shruti kahati hai, “zyaadaatar yuva sochate hai ki ghazal udaasi bhari hoti hai, jinamein khoi hui muhabbat kaa dard bayaan kiya jaataa he
 But if you go deep into this mode, you will find that there is more to it
 ” nida fazli, wasim barelvi, ahamed faraj, parveen shakir jaise samasamyik shaayaron ne saamaajik vishyon par bhi kalam chalaai he or badalte vakt ke dukh-dard or khushiyon ke alaava deshprem ko bhi vyakt kiya he
 counter-criticismsmusic director, producer and sitarist Tushar Bhatia believes that even though Jagjit Singh has a keen interest in Western music, his close relationship with Bollywood and voiced contemporary issues, he never let the spirit of the ghazals lighten up 
 ajij kaa maananaa he ki ghazal kii “ruh or mizaaj” ko khatm karnaa anyaay hoga
 Regarding the experiments being done with Ghazal, he says, "just as a beautiful girl can wear any cloth as long as it enhances her beauty, it is the same with Ghazals
 aadhunik sangeet kaa yah gilaaf ghazal par sundar laganaa chahie, na ki use badrang karne vaala hona chahie
 In 2003 i mixed the blues with ghazals
 main har kisi ko aisa karne kii salaah nahin duungaa, jo apane kshetra se baahar jaakar koi prayog kare
 It is like trying to get a master's degree without graduating
 ” akhtar kehete hai, “yah sirf jugalbandi ke taur par vaadyayantra kaa istemaal karnaa bhar nahin he
 i learned western music when i worked with nadeem-shravan as an assistant
 maine recording kaa antarrashtriya tarika bhi siikhaa
 It was with this experience that i could dare to do new experiments with ghazals and convince the musicians what i needed
 ”rashmi agarwal jaanati hai ki shuddhtavaadi log jaij sangeetkaaron ke saath prayogon ko pasand nahin karenge, lekin ve apni koshish ko aage le jane ke liye drudh hai
 He hopes that the audience will definitely like his program on 2 November in Delhi
 ve kahati hai, “jab aap kuch nayaa rachate hai to aapako bane-banaae niyamon ko toduya padataa he, varanaa aap kuch nayaa nahin bana paaenge
 "there is a lot for purists to look back on," warns Akhtar
 lekin agali peedi ko vahiin tak rukne kii jarurat nahin he
 You will not accept new experiments and will not be ready to see things from a new perspective, then you have to be ready to finish
 ” gayak or naatakkaar reeta ganguli kii raay isse milti-julati he
 She cites the example of her maestro Begum Akhtar, saying, "he too gave modern look to Ghazal in his time
 main samajhati hum ki jab tak ghazal ke arth or uski khubsuurati kaa katl nahin kiya jaataa, tab tak is bare main chintaa karne kii koi jarurat nahin he
 "nasal says," Ghazal is a matter emanating from the heart and people sing it with appreciation
 vaadyayantra chaahe hindustani hon yaa pashchimi, ghazal kii lokapriyata bani rahegi
 "he has presented many intriguing ghazals with great beauty
 bhaatia begum akhtar ke us record ko yaad karte hai, jisamen clerinet ke saath hormonium kaa bhi istemaal kiya gaya tha, jise un dinon pashchimi vaadyayantra samajha jaataa tha
 According to him, experimenting with ghazals is not unique
 ve kehete hai, “jab pehali baar ghazal ko sangeet ke saath pesh kiya gaya tha to yah bilkul nai baat thi
 But people took it in hand
 ” kuch bhi ho, nae jamaane ke ye gayak ghazal ko nai shakl dene ke liye nai ummiido se labarej hai
 Senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh supported the opportunity to hand over evidence to the CBI against Rajinder Kumar, Special Director of Intelligence Bureau (IB), in connection with the fake encounter of college student Ishrat Jahan in Gujarat
 singh ne kaha ki aisa aarope he ki gujarat police ne farji muthbhed kii thi
 Investigation is going on in this regard
 unhone kaha ki aisa aarope bhi he ki ibi ke kuch adhikariyon ne gujarat police ke saath milakar kuch galat kiya he
 If the CBI has evidence, then it should be given a chance to prove it
 unase ishrat farji muthbhed maamle main rajindar kumaar ko poochtacha ke liye bulaaye jane ke sibiai ke faisle par sawaal kiya gaya tha
 CBI Director Ranjit Sinha has said that the agency has enough evidence to send summons to summon Kumar for questioning

 India fears that the lashkar-e-taiba responsible for the Mumbai attacks may attempt an attack during the Commonwealth Games in New Delhi in October
 bharat ne america ko is silsile main apni chintaa se avgat karaayaa he
 In one of its dispatches from Islamabad, the 'sunday Times' said that the leadership of the Indian Army had conveyed this apprehension to US Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen
 mulen is shuukravaar-shanivaar nayi dilli main the
 lashkar-e-taiba launched a terrorist attack on Mumbai in November 2008, killing 166 people
 ‘sande times’ ke mutabik, bharat ko bhay he ki lashkar use phir nishaanaa bana saktaa he
 On reaching Pakistan, Mullen said on Saturday that lashkar-e-taiba was spreading its wings in Afghanistan and the western world and has become more active in the entire region
 yah bhi daawa kiya gaya he ki mumbai par do varsh pehle aatanki hamale karne vaale lashkar ne afghanistan main pashchimi deshon ke sainikon kii hatya ke liye taliban ke saath ek nayaa gathjod bana liya he
 The newspaper wrote that NATO commanders have also begun to believe that Lashkar is behind the serial attacks and the infiltration of terrorists in eastern Afghanistan
 is khabar ke anusaar pakistan ke sena pramukh ashfak kayaani ke saath islamabad main baithak ke liye pahunchane ke baad kal yah muddar admiral mulen ne uthaaya
 According to the news, lashkar-e-taiba was founded by Pakistan's Security Service to send terrorists to Jammu and Kashmir
 lashkar e taiyaba ko america dabaav ke kaaran 2002 main pratibandhit kar diya gaya or yah samooh bhinn bhinn naamon se apane kaarykram chalaa rahaa he
 al-qaeda has been using the Lashkar camps for training for a long time
 shuruuaat main inkaar ke baad pakistan ne aakhirkaar sweekaar kar liya tha ki 26 november ko mumbai par aatankwaadi hamale karne main lashkar ne bhoomika nibhaai thi 
 a large number of people were killed in these attacks
 america adhikariyon ko bhi chintaa he ki lashkar ne afghanistan par dhyaan kendrit kar liya he or uskaa agenda vishwa str kaa ho gaya he
 Mullen said, "since the year 2008, we are seeing his progress
 yah vaishvik aakankshaon vaala ek aatankwaadi sanghathan he
 This organization is becoming more deadly, this in Afghanistan as well as in other countries
 ’’ akhbaar kii khabar ke anusaar pakistani sena ne pakistani taliban jaise aatankwaadi sanghathanon ke khilaaf karrwai shuru kii he lekin america ke baar baar anurodh ke baavjood isane afgaan taliban yaa lashkar ke khilaaf karrwai karne se inkaar kiya he

 com / fhsxk1m2mj gangrape ek aisa lafj he jise sunate hi sirahan daud jaati he, man khatta ho jaataa he lekin kya aap yakeen karenge ki is duniya main aise bhi log maujuud hai, jo gangrape jaisi kisi sangeen vaardaat ko bhi hathiyaar bana kar kisi ko blackmel kar sakate hai? aisi ek jahrili jodi he jo gangrape kii juthi report likhva kar logon ko blackmel karti thi lekin is baar baaji ulti pad gai or ek sting oparation main is jodi kii asaliyat kaid ho gai
 The act of the pair, which has been arrested by the Delhi Police in the name of gangrape, for blackmailing and bargaining, is similar
 ek sting oparation main ye blackmailer jodi khud apni jubaan se apana gunaah kubul karti dikh rahi he or ye sting oparation is jodi kii taabut main aakhri keel sabit hua
 In the sting operation, the girl who wrote a gang rape report in Sachesting, is talking to the gang rape accused herself along with her partner
 or na sirf baat kar rahi he, balki khuleam se ye kah rahi he ki kaise wo agali baar jab police ke saamne bayaan degi to khud apni hi baton se mukar jaaegi
 She will say that when she was drunk, she was drunk and the boys who were caught by the police, they are neither the boys nor the car in which they were gangraped
 karte the torget kaa pichhadrasal, ye kahani he dilli kii us jahrili jodi kii jo gum-gum kar apane shikaar kii talash karti thi
 Then it would target some boys and put a false charge of gang rape on them
 or jab shikaar jaal main funs jaataa, to phir shuru hota he gangrape kii juthi report ke badale blakemeling or saudebaaji kaa khel lekin is tarah ek ke baad ek kai logon ko luutane ke baad jab is jodi ne dilli kii sanalit colony thane main 10 june kii raat gangrape kii jo aakhri report likhaai, vahi juthi report inke liye ji kaa janjaal sabit hui
 His divorces broke out, but his way of robbing someone was very strange and shocking, from the accusations of gangrape to laying the trap of blackmailing
 video ne kholi juthi ladki kii polbegunaahon ko gangrape ke jhuthe ilzaam main fansaa kar unhen blackmel karanevaali jodi ne is baar do ladakon ko apane jaal main fansaaya tha
 Two boys who did not even know this girl
 police ne ladki kii shikaayat par donon ke khilaaf report bhi darj kar lee lekin ain maukey par mili ek footage ne ladki kii chugali kar di
 This girl was seen in this footage
 kya he puraa maamla?police ko sau number par ek kol milti he
 The calling girl is extremely upset and reveals that she has been raped by three boys after being abducted in a Maruti Swift car
 chunki shikaayat behad sangeen he isliye kol sunate hi police harakat main aa jaati he
 a PCR van immediately arrives close to the ITO at the girl's whereabouts, where the victim girl and a friend meet the police
 donon bataate hai ki abhi wo nizamuddin ke kamasam restraan main dinar ke liye ja hi rahi thi ki raste main ladki ko ek swift car main aae ladakon ne agava kar liya or chalati car main hi uske saath gangrape kiya gaya
 After this, the boys who gangraped threw him to ITO and went away
 police ko pehali baar hua shakanirbhaya cond ke baad jab desh main gangrape ke maamalon ko lekar itani halchal ho, thik usee tarj par phir se dilli main kisi ladki ko agava kar uske saath gangrape kii kahani vaaki police ko pareshaan kar detii he
 So, police file a report and start the investigation fast
 lekin iske baad police ko tab pehali baar jhatka lagata he, jab ladki ke bataae number ke mutabik wo us swift car tres karti he, jisamen gangrape kii baat kahi gai he
 It emerges that the boys who went up to Nizamuddin in that Swift car that night were not three, but two
 or donon hi lagaataar gangrape ke iljaam se hairaan ho rahe the
 The story of the girl who turned out to be false in this way started to doubt the girl who wrote the report to the police, but she wanted to test it before reaching any conclusion
 or isi iraade se wo us restraan tak bhi pahunchi, jiske baahar se ladki ke agava hone kii baat kahi gai thi
 But in the CCTV footage of the restaurant, he saw a picture that raised his ears
 darasal, is footage main khud ko peedit bataane vaali ladki restraan ke andar bade aaraam se gumti nazar aa rahi thi jabaki ladki ne apni shikaayat main ye kaha tha ki gangrape karne vaale ladakon ne use restraan tak pahunchane se pehle hi agava kar liya tha
 The police conducted the sting operation with the boys, the question was then how was the girl imprisoned in the CCTV camera inside the restaurant? Apparently, the girl was lying
 udhar, ladke police se ye fariyaad to kar rahe the ki maamla jhootha he, saath hi ye bhi bataa rahe the peedit ladki or uskaa dost gangrape kii report waapas lene ke liye unase das lakh rupye maang rahe hai
 Now the matter was ready to take a U-turn and then the police decided to have a sting operation done as the final proof
 oparation juthi shikaayat karne vaali ladki or uske dost kaa
 In the sting, the blackmailers unleashed their polpolis, who had now received several proofs against the poisonous pair, but were waiting for another proof to hit the last nail in the coffin
 lihaaza, police ne is jodi kaa shikaar bane ladakon ko hi unka sting oparation karne ke liye taiyaar kiya
 Then the pair said such things on the intelligence camera that the listeners simply kept listening
 is sting oparation main report kaa sach to saamne aa hi gaya, ye bhi saaf ho gaya ki kaise report likhavane vaali ladki or uskaa dost apane shikaar yani maamle ke muljimon se exiaar waapas lene ke liye das lakh rupye maang kar rahe the
 The police arrested the blackmailer couple
 In this case, after several statements of the girl's repeated statements and the innocence of the boys, the evidence was now clear like a mirror
 lihaaza, police ne gang rape kaa maamla khaarij kar ulta ladki or uske partner ko hi giraftaar kar liya
 Now these two businessmen, who were blackmailing in the name of gangrape, had come under the grip of the gang and they also got their entire raw-sheet in front
 aropiyon ne kiye kai khulaasegangrape kii juthi report likhavane ke iljaam main police ne sapana naam kii ladki ko uske dost ke saath giraftaar kar liya
 But when the investigation progressed, it was found that the victims of this couple who had looted millions were more
 jaise-jaise maamle kii tafteesh aage badhati he is ladki or uske dost ke bare main police ko aisi-aisi kahaniyaan pataa chalati he ki khud vardeevaale bhi hairaan rah jate hai
 The pair had trapped innocents in the past, it is known that this pair did not do this act for the first time, when a boy tried to extort money from them by implicating them in the trap of rape or gang rape, but this couple did so many times before
 She had done it
 udhar, police kii is karrwai kaa pataa chalate hi aise kai log dilli ke sanlite colony thane ke paas jamaa ho jate hai, jinke saath yaa phir jinke apano ke saath is jodi ne yun hi pehle kabhi thagi kii thi
 The modus operandi of this couple, who used to give vicious manner, was shocking
 ye shikaar kii talash main kisi restraan yaa phir aisi hi kisi duusari jagah par jate, phir jaise hi vahaan se koi nikalataa najar aata, uskaa peechha karte
 On the way, he would call the police after fabricating the story of gangrape
 jab mobile phone kii lokation tres kii jaati, to shikaayat sahi lagatikyonki aaropee or ladki ke mobile phone kaa lokation saath miltaa
 And thus the screws on the innocents would have been tightened
 police ne shuru kii karrwiiske baad shuru hota blakemeling kaa silsilaa
 The girl and her friend used to threaten to send their victims to jail in a false gang rape case and offered to withdraw the complaint and demanded money
 phir saudebaaji shuru hoti or tab jabaran vasuuli lekin ab ye jodi police ke shikanje main hai or ye yakeenan police ke saath-saath aam logon ke liye bhi raahat kii khabar he

 # Four states had imposed banmangalwar, the Haryana government decided to ban the film's release
 ranvir, deepika, shahid kapur starer ye film rajput samudaay ke virodh ke baad se hi vivaadon main he
 Prior to Haryana, the governments of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh had also banned the screening of the film

 He said, 'this is an honor for Rani Padmini
 puri film main aisi koi baat nahin he, jis par aapatti jataai jaae
 i am surprised that some people are opposing this film
 ' shrishri ne yah bhi kaha, film ko lekar ab tak jo vivaad hua vah bevajaah he
 The film is a true tribute to Rani Padmini and a proud saga of Rajput honor
 # rajasthan main sadak par pradarshanis bich rajasthan main film ke pradarshan ko lekar sadak par virodh kiya ja rahaa he
 Karni Sena has threatened to burn theaters showing the film
 # teen bhashaaon main film haagi relizebta den, sanjay lila bhansaali kii film padmavat teen bhashaaon tamil, telegu or hindi main relies hogi
 The sensor has given the film a u / a certificate with five modifications

 This will be the first Hindi film in the country to release in IMAX 3D Hindi
 # sensor ne banaai thi special cametikuch hi din pehle sensor ne film kii certification prakriya puri hone kii jaankaree di thi
 The censor constituted a committee for this
 cameti kii siforeeshon ke baad nirmaataaon ke saath ek meeting main film main 5 jaruri badlaav sujhaaye gaye the
 These changes are on the points that Deepika's film Padmavat has been opposing for the last several months

 CBSE Boards kii parikshaayen march ke bajaae farvari main yojit karne ke prastaav par privet skulon ne apni naaraazgi jaahir kii he
 Schools argue that CBSE is changing the educational structure of schools, instead of removing its shortcomings, the benefit of which is less loss
 darasal CBSE ne 10veen or 12veen board kii parikshaayen march ke bajaae farvari main yani ki ek maheenaa pehle yojit karne kii yojana banaai he
 CBSE says that there is no mistake in the evaluation of marks, that is why preparations are being made to do the exam cycle a month in advance
 itnaa hi nahin pariksha kii puri prakriya jo abhi 45 dinon tak chalati he use bhi ghataakar ek maheene main khatm karne par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 But this CBSE proposal to schools is not appealing at all
 to vahiin chaatr or abhibhavak bhi CBSE ke baar baar badalte niyamon kii vajah se naakhush hai
 Confusion in students, the results of class 12 are very important in realizing the dreams of the students
 isliye chaatr 12veen kii padhai ke saath jis uniwarsity or course main daakhila lenaa chaahate he uske liye taiyaari shuru kar dete hai
 Shivanshi is also one of such students, who wants to enroll in DU, so Shivanshi has prepared the entire time table of 12th syllabus
 yani ki kitne chapter, kab or kitne samay main puraa karnaa he, kab revijan karnaa he aadi
 But ever since Shivanshi came to know that CBSE is planning to conduct Boards exams in February instead of March, Shivanshi's entire planning has gone awry
 CBSE kii yojana se skool association naakhushjahan shivanshi ke liye apana silebus tay samay se ek maheene pehle puraa karne kii chunauti he vahiin skulon ke saamne puraa shaikshanik kaarykram he, jo ki CBSE kii pariksha ek maheene pehle yojit karne ke faisle se charmara jayega
 According to SK Bhattacharya, President of the Action Committee for Enforced Reconstituted Private School Association - 'every class has an academic calendar, on the basis of which teachers complete the syllabus within 10 months by dividing the chapters of their subject
 isi acadmic calendar main skool kii mid turm pariksha, samar-winter vekeshan, sarkari chhuttiyaan, anual fest or kai ajukational activities bhi skool yojit karata he
 Sometimes when the winters are high, due to government orders on increasing pollution, schools have to take holidays without following the academic calendar
 ' aise main bina skulon se salaah-mashwara kiye academic seshan shuru hone ke baad is tarah CBSE kaa prastaav skulon ko manjuur nahin he
 Parents have also raised questions on this scheme of CBSE, parents are also raising questions, whose children are going to take 12th examination in the same academic session
 abhibhavakon kii maane to satr shuru hone ke baad is tarah bich main parikshaayen jaldi yojit karne ke faisle se chaatro or skulon par anchaaha dabaav padegaa
 The parents also argued that the university starts the process of admission only after the results of the board, so if the results come quickly, then the university can also start its admission process quickly
 yani ki CBSE jis makasad se pariksha jaldi yojit karnaa chaahati he wo kitna safal hoga ye kah paanaa mushkil he
 But according to the education experts, the students will benefit from conducting the examination early, provided that there is such a change in the educational system of the schools that there is no pressure on the students
 karier councellir jitin chawla ne isse jude kuch negative or positive points bataae hai
 Positive 1
 baccho ko entrens exam ke liye zyada time mil jayega
 2
 bachche 12th ke exam se jaldi free ho jaaenge jisase unhen opshans talashne kaa time mil paayegaa
 3
 bachche sirf thodi pre -planning karke jaldi exam ke liye taiyaar ho sakate hai
 4
 board ko tasalli se copy check karne kaa time mil sakegaa
 5
 nateezon se santusht nahin hone par chaatro ko ri-vairiffikesh, punarmoolyankan or photocopy ke liye samay milegaa
 Negative 1
 bacchon par course puraa karne or phir exam ke anusaar taiyaari karne kaa pressure bad saktaa hai
 2
 skulon ko bhi apane home exam jaise half-yearli, pre-board jaldi karne honge jiske liye course puraa karwaane kaa pressure badhegaa
 3
 skulon ko academic calendar dubaara dizin karne honge, taaki farvari se pehle bina kisi tanaav ke silebus puraa ho jaae or chaatro ko nuksaan naa uthaanaa pade
 On this issue, when we spoke to the students who have recently passed the 12th examination, they shared their experiences and welcomed the decision
 bataa den ki CBSE board kii parikshaayen jaldi yojit karne ke prastaav ko isi satr main lagu karnaa chaahati he yani ki jo chaatr saal 2017-18 main 12veen kii padhai kar rahe hai, unhen saal 2018 main march ke bajaae farvari main pariksha deni pad sakati he or skool iske paksh main nahin he
 So if CBSE is adamant on its decision then there is bound to be a confrontation between CBSE and schools

 India's nuclear program is on the verge of collapse
 pichley chaar saal se koi bada tender nahin diya ja sakaa he
 Ironically, this is a period in which it was expected that after the indo-us civil nuclear deal, a new nuclear age would be started in the country
 haryana ke gorakhpur ke sanyantr main pehle charan main 720-megawatt ke swadesh nirmit preshriced heavi water riector taiyaar hone the, lekin vahaan kaam rukaa hua he kyonki kachche maal kii aapurti karne waalon ne nivida par aage badhaane se inkaar kar diya he
 They are seeking assurance that they will not be held responsible for any nuclear accident
 parmaanu urja vibhaag (diei) ke purv adhyaksh anil kakodakar ne india today ko bataaya, “meraa khyaal he ki unhone (kachche maal kii aapurti karne vaale) is aashay kaa patr bhi likhaa he
 This is a major obstacle in the expansion of nuclear power sector in India
 iskaa koi samaadhaan nikaalnaa hi padegaa varanaa parmaanu kaarykram ko nuksaan pahonchega
 “the root of the problem is the Civil Nuclear Compensation Accountability Act of 2010, which provides for the liability of the operator as well as the supplier in case of a nuclear accident
 adhinium kii vivaadaaspad dhara 17 (bi) ke tahat kaha gaya he ki agar nirmaan kii ‘pratyaksh yaa paroksh’ kharabi hone se koi parmaanu durghatana hoti he to oparator ko aapurti karne vaale se sauda palatney kaa adhikaar he
 Apart from this, there are also very stringent provisions in section 46 in the law
 yah dhara saaf kar detii he ki oparator ko kisi anya kanoon ke tahat bhi raahat nahin mil sakati, jiskaa sahaara peedit adhik muaavje kii maang ke liye le saktaa he
 There is no specific mention of the suppliers in this section, but the concern of the suppliers is that in case of accident, other cases are also likely
 kya he samasyndhinium ke ye do praavdhaan bhartiya or videshi aapurtikartaaon ke liye sabase badi baadha ban gaye hai, jisase parmaanu vistaar yojanaon ke thapp pad jane kaa khatra paidaa ho gaya he
 Foreign reactor suppliers led by the US have raised strong objections to these provisions of damages
 newclear power korporation of india limited (enpisiiel) ke purv adhyaksh es
 K
 jain kehete hai, “agar hamane is bare main jald hi koi samaadhaan nahin nikaala to vartmaan parmaanu sanyantr bhi musiibat main funs jaaenge
 This is a problem from which both Indian and foreign suppliers are apprehensive
 ”bharat-america parmaanu qaraar kii ek anivaary shart thi ki javabdehi tay karne vaala koi kanoon fouran banaaya jaae
 In order to create an environment conducive for business to all parties involved in the nuclear business, a principle came out globally to decide the accountability and some things about the lawsuit in case of any accident
 is tarah buniyadi sidghant yah ubhar kar aayaa ki durghatana kii haalat main kisi tarah ke nuksaan ke liye parmaanu sanyantr kaa oparator jimmedaar hoga
 This rule of fixing accountability has been accepted worldwide
 iskaa yah arth bhi hua ki aapurti karne vaala doshi nahin mana jayega
 In such a climate of climate change, such a system has helped in developing nuclear energy as clean energy
 is disha main aage badhate hue antarrashtriya parmaanu urja agency ne bhi isi ke aadhaar par kanvension on supplementary compenceshan (siessi) naam se aachaar samhita taiyaar kii he, jiske anusaar oparator par har tarah kii jimmedaari daal di gai he
 Under the nuclear agreement, India agreed to bring a bill similar to the CSC rules and to amend the convention later
 centre sarkaar ne siessi par hastakshar kar die hai lekin america kaa kahana he ki bhartiya niyam siessi model ke anuroop nahin hai
 On a larger scale, this issue is also not in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's goal that a conducive and comfortable environment will be created for doing business in India
 america ko do sthanon par riector lagane kaa aashwaasan diya gaya he, or vah modi sarkaar par samaadhaan talashne kaa dabaav bana rahaa he
 Now that US President Barack Obama is coming as the chief guest on Republic Day, efforts to find a solution are intensifying
 dakshin korea ekmaatr doosraa aisa desh he jahaan parmaanu javabdehi sambandhi kanoon main is aashay ke praavdhaan hai ki parmaanu durghatana hone par oparator ko aapurtikarta se sauda palatney or harjaana vasuulne kaa adhikaar he
 But Korean law also makes it clear that these provisions will only apply if it is explicitly mentioned in the commercial agreement between the operator and the supplier
 duusare shabdon main kahen to qaraar ko hi sarvopari mana gaya he
 The UPA government tried to make a provision to keep the deal reversed or recover the damages from the agreement
 lekin bijepi kii aguai main vipaksh ne is par hangaamaa khadaa kar diya or sarkaar par pichley daravaaje se badlaav laane kaa aarope madh diya
 The UPA government bowed down and tried to resolve the issue by altering the rules
 khaskar niyam 24 main aapurtikarta ke liye samay seemaa tay karne kii koshish kii gai jo bahut kuch varantee kii samay seemaa jaisaa he
 Along with this, an attempt was also made to decide the amount of damages that the amount will not exceed the amount of agreement in any case
 is par bhi us samay rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ne, jo ab vitt mantri hai, aapatti uthaai thi
 On the BJP website in September 2013, he wrote, "although Rule 24 relates to section 17 (a) of the Act, the language of section 17 (b) has been forcibly added to the definition of product accountability period
 isse sthiti aspasht ho gai ki dhara 17 (e) or 17 (bi) ko ek-duusare se jodakar padhaa jayega, alag-alag nahin
 "now a year later, the same problem has arisen in front of the ruling BJP, which is trying to attract foreign investment to the energy sector to protect India's nuclear program from the ill effects of this law
 kya he samadhaamerica ne yah mudda modi sarkaar ke saamne uthaane kaa koi avasar nahin choda, pradhanmantri ke washington daure ke dauraan bhi ise sidhe uthaaya gaya tha
 Subsequently an expert group of officers was formed to resolve the issue
 is samooh kii ek baithak bhi ho chuki he or obama ke bharat daure se pehle thos samaadhaan ke prayaas main duusari baithak bhi hone vaali he
 If both sides find a valid solution in the meantime, it would be the biggest achievement of the visit of the US President
 videshi or bhartiya aapurtikartaaon kii najar main to sabase acha vikalp kanoon main sanshodhan karnaa hi hoga
 But it would be like a reversal for the BJP in another case, as it took a stubborn approach in this case like many other cases while in opposition
 is maheene ke shuru main dilli main vidhi centre for legal policy dwaara is vishay par yojit seminar main arun jetali ne is par zyada kuch bolne se inkaar kar diya
 They said that it is still being discussed at the official level, so they are not in a position to speak much
 phir bhi unhone yah jarur kaha, “main sirf itnaa hi kah saktaa hum ki jab ham sansad main is mudde par bahes kar rahe the to duusare paksh se hamen aashwasti bhari pratikriya nahin mili thi
 “for the past year, DAE has been trying to find a solution to this controversial problem without amending the law
 is disha main pehla kadam ek beemaa vyavastha taiyaar karne kaa he jisase saplir or oparator ko javabdehi ke liye suraksha hasil ho jaae
 Given the fact that India could not allow inspection of its plants, it was no longer an option to contact a foreign insurance company
 lihaaja, general insurance company (jiisi) se sampark kiya gaya lekin aadchan yah paidaa hui ki yah company 900 karod ru
 Cannot insure more than Rs
 1,500 crore for an operator under the law
 tak ke muaavje kii seemaa tay kii gai he
 So, it was thought that the remaining Rs 600 crore
 ke ‘catastropha bond’ jari kiye ja sakate hai
 More thought was done on this idea and it has been turned into a concrete proposal
 is prastaav par pichley maheene america se bhi charchaa kii ja chuki he
 The scheme broadly operates on two levels
 pehla bhaag oparator ke liye he, bhartiya sandarbh main yah enpisiiel hogi
 According to international regulations, all plants will have to be shut down in the event of an incident, so the need is felt that the operator needs to get accident insurance for one plant or at most two for all the plants
 phir, yah suzav diya gaya ki itani hi rakam kii aisi hi vyavastha aapurtikartaaon ke liye bhi kii ja sakati he
 All parties will consider this as a general insurance policy, which will be decided according to the goods they supply
 philhal to is model ko sweekruti nahin mil pai he
 Suppliers are insisting on the removal of section 46, while the government's reply is that that provision does not affect suppliers
 lekin is baat se sab sahamat hai ki har tarah kii aspashtataa ko dur kiya janaa chahie, ek prastaav yah he ki vyavsaayik qaraar main iskaa spasht ullekh hona chahie
 Member of Atomic Energy Commission R
 bi
 Says Grover, "it is clear that section 46 does not affect the supplier in any way and should be mentioned in the agreement but the law recognizes the supremacy of the agreement
 ”isse duusari bahes shuru ho sakati he ki kya kanoon main sanshodhan kiye bina hal nikaala ja saktaa he
 Law Commission Chairman A
 pi
 Legal luminaries like Shah argue that Rule 24 is against the soul of the law and therefore it will not be lawful
 aise paridrishy main sarkaar ke saamne pasopesh kii sthiti he ki vah kanoon main sanshodhan kiye bina kaise samaadhaan talash sakati he
 Former Indian ambassador to the US, Ronen Sen, is of the opinion that the government should not rush into finding a solution, nervous by Obama's visit
 ve kehete hai, “is samay hamen kritrim samay seemaa par nahin chalanaa chahie
 This should be considered in due course
 beshak, sabase bada prashn yah he ki ham sirf kharidaar-vikreta vaala sambandh rakhana chaahate hai yaa technology kaa hastantaran bhi chaahate hai?” kakodakar kehete hai, “agar aap bade nahin ban sakate to aise kshetra main ja sakate hai, jahaan dusron ke asar main rahenge
 “obviously, this will be an important strategic task for the government on which India's nuclear future rests

 tippaniyan It is being told that Kangana Ranaut was going to do a film with Hrithik, but Hrithik did not like some of Kangana's statements and refused to work with this Bollywood actress

 bhrashtachar ke mudde par baba ramdev kii jabardast sakriyata ke baad se raajnneeti main dharmaguruon kii bhoomika par nae sire se bahes shuru ho gai he
 After seeing Ramdev's fire and destiny, political parties are advising the babas to keep their business from their work
 yah paath padhaane main congress ke bade netaa sabase aage rahe hai
 But these practices do not seem to affect the political ambitions of saints and mahants
 agar raajnneeti kii duniya ke manje hue dharmik khilaadiyon ko chhod den to bhiaise mahanton kii kami nahin he jinaki dhuni raajnneeti kii duniya main thik-thaak tareeke se ramane lagi he

 If you look at the politics of Uttarakhand, Brahmashroop, the Mahant of Jairam Ashram of Haridwar, is making his presence present in the politics of Brahmachari
 desh bhar main 40 ashram, shiksha or swasthya sansthaaon kaa sanchaalan kar rahe, unke trust ke paas 550 se 600 karod ru
 (independent valuation of property at current market value) is the property of
 iske saath hi ve pradesh congress ke upaadhyaksh bhi hai
 Brahmachari, who was close to Congress leader Harish Rawat until 2002, later came close to Narayan Dutt Tiwari
 apane ashram main logon kii bheed ko aashirwad dene vaale in mahanton ke paas netaa bhi sir nava rahe hai
 According to experts, Brahmachari was rightly heard in the Congress ticket distribution in the 2002 and 2007 assembly elections
 desh main bhavy ashramon or shandaar skool-collejon ke nirmaan main lage brahmacharee nijee jivan main sukh suvidhaon ko bura nahin maanate
 Brahmachari, wearing a gold-studded Rudraksha Mala, said, "it is time's compulsion to build grand and air-conditioned buildings of the ashrams
 jab bhakt suvidhaon kii maang karenge to unhen sahuliyatein uplabdh karaane main harrj hi kya he
 On the question "whether a brahmachari should live amidst such a majesty and he does not cease to be a manager in the operation of a large religious structure", he said, "this is the scientific age
" ab sadhu jhenpadi main rahakar to desh kaa vikaas nahin kar saktaa
 Poor man cannot overcome poverty
 jab main vaibhav ke saath rahoonga tabhi to nari peedi ko bhi garibi se mukti paane kaa sandesh milegaa
 Brahmachari, an MA in economics, said that he has been associated with politics since his student life and being associated with the Congress has no hindrance in his religious work
 unhone bataaya ki ashram kii sampatti main desh bhar main 40 ashram shaamil hai
 Five of these grand ashrams are in Haridwar
 ve khud 512 kamare vaale mukhya jairam ashram main baithte hai
 Apart from this, the trust has several ashrams in Delhi, Vrindavan, Rishikesh, Kurukshetra, Jind and Sonipat, while Haridwar has a charitable hospital
 rishikesh main jairam sanskrit mahavidhyalay, jairam homeopathic chikitsaalay, jairam krishi farm, devendraswaroop brahmacharee international public skool, jairam gaushala jaisi sampatti he
 The Trust is operating Jayaram Vidyapeeth, Harbakhsh Lohia Jayaram Girls Polytechnic, Seth Navrangarai Lohia Women's Hospital, Kesari Devi Public School in Kurukshetra, Haryana
 iske alaava jind, sonipat or vrundavan main unke bade ashram hai
 Jayaram Vidyapeeth is a grand ashram in Kurukshetra which also has a large pond and two guest houses for 200 people
 trust kii badi pariyojnaon main 100 karod ru
 a modern hospital is also included in Kurukshetra at a cost of Rs
 brahmacharee ke mutabik ashram trust kaa salanaa turnover 3 karod ru
 However, they have not assessed the value of property spread across the country
 haalanki is sampatti kaa bazaar mulya par nunatam akalan bhi karen to yah puri kii puri sampatti 550 se 600 karod ru
 Sits between haridwar, rishikesh, vrundavan or kurukshetra kii zyaadaatar sampatti posh ilaakon main hai or ashramon main sabhi aadhunik suvidhaayen maujuud hai
 Before leaving for the recruitment process of teachers in the school of Rishikesh in his luxury car, Brahmachari claimed that such religious property does not give rise to any kind of controversy and anyway the loincloth-dhoti is no longer the age
 ashram trust dwaara kisi tarah kaa doosraa kaarobaar shuru karne ke sawaal par unhone kaha, ''naa baba naa
 Our ashram is far away from these things
 ''haridwar main mahanton kii rajnatik sakriyata jamini str tak vyaapt he
 Mahant Satpal Brahmachari of Thanaram Ashram is not only an active Congress leader but also a former chairman of the municipal council
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) kii chaaya main paley-bade satpal brahmacharee 2004 tak bhaajapa main the or uske baad congress main aa gaye
 However, since the Ramdev episode, many leaders of the Congress have not been able to reduce their spirits by publicly asking Babas to stay away from politics
 brahmacharee ne bhi haal hi main apane pracheen thanaram ashram ke saath hi bhavy radha krishna dham ashram kii sthapana kii he jo atyaadhunik suvidhaon se sajjit he
 Apart from this, construction of another grand ashram is going on
 in teenon ashramon kii sampatti kaa bazaar mulya 15 karod ru
 Sits around nae ashramon ke nirmaan ke liye dhan jutaney ke sawaal par satpal brahmacharee ne kaha, ''isamen meraa kuch nahin he
 The whole thing is about trust
 ye gaadi-ghoda jo aap dekh rahe hai sab ashram kaa he
 Devotees are constructing money and devotees use it
 ham to ashram main rukne kaa kisi se paisa nahin maangate, bhagwaan ke naam par jise jo daan karnaa he, kare
 On the question of fumigation of politics with religion, Brahmachari said, "for me, politics is the medium of social service
 raajnneeti ko nichi nigaah se dekhnaa thik nahin he
 People like Mahatma Gandhi and Shastriji were also leaders
 vaise bhi brahmacharee hone ke baavjood maine mahamandaleshwar yaa anya koi dharmik oopaadhi nahin lee he
 Justifying AC ashrams, Brahmachari said, "those who live in AC in their home will make similar demands in religious places
 '' unke ashram main mandir ke upar kesaria or baahar maidan main yuvak congress kaa jhda laharaata he
 Along with narrative discourses, inauguration of establishments and political gatherings are part of their daily routine
 45 varshiya brahmacharee raajnneeti main ubharate baabaaon kii nai jamaat main shaamil hai
 Congress leader sitting on the throne and Rishishwaranand (sanjay Mahant) of Chetan Jyoti Ashram are also in the same line
 ve congress saansad harish ravat ke kareebi hai or pichley 6-7 saal se raajnneeti main dhuni rama rahe hai
 On the question of interest in politics, Mahant said, "it is not at all uncomfortable for me
 mere guru brahmaleen bagishwaranand ji bhi haridwar nagarpalika ke adhyaksh rah chuke hai
 On the question of the impact of politics on the religious life, he clearly accepted that he belongs to the lowest class of sadhus and he does not even claim that people consider him a sadhu
 mahant ne kaha, ''ham koi avatar to hai nahin, isi vyavastha kaa ang hai
 Why should we avoid politics? mahant or saamaajik kaaryakarta main koi fark nahin he
 Do not understand why people are behind the property of the Sadhus? ”his Ashram Trust is running a Sanskrit college, a Gurukul, an Inter college, an Ayurveda dispensary and Ved Vidyalaya in Haridwar
 jald hi ashram ek pi ji college bhi kholegaa
 He claims that the annual turnover of the ashram is Rs 20 lakh
 ke aasapaas he
 On the valuation of the property, he said that the ashram is 125 years old, its physical evaluation is not possible
 lekin haridwar main chal rahi maujuuda keemton kii kasuti par kasen to in sampatti kaa mulya 15 se 18 karod ru
 Sits between haridwar ke hi swami yatishwaranand bhartiya janata party ke netaa hai
 He has been the General Secretary of the party in the state
 swami agnivesh ke saath rahe yatishwaranand puraani tehsil ke paas arya samaaj mandir kaa sanchaalan karte hai
 He has not yet given a new look to the ashram spread in this important area of haridwar
 unhone kaha, ''behatar yahi hoga ki mahant log ashramon main bahut zyada dhan or vaibhav kaa prasar na karen
 Especially if you are in politics, such things raise doubts
 '' unke is ashram kii sampatti kaa bazaar mulya do se dhai karod ru
 Is close to is dharm nagari main rajaneta ab bhale hi sidhe raajnneeti kar rahe hon lekin netaaon or baabaaon ke rishte isse kahin puraane hai
 Earlier leaders used to come here to bless
 haridwar ke kankhal ilaake main shri panchayat akhaada mahanirvaani ke mahant rabindra puri ne kaha, ''is desh ke 99 fisadi netaa dharm bheeru hai
 He speaks of separating religion from politics from the upper mind itself
 ''bhavy sofe par virajman puri ke bagal vaale kamare main akhaade ke saadhuon ke saath jawaharlal nehru, indira gandhi, sanjay gandhi se lekar digvijay singh tak kii tasviren unki baat kii tasdik kar rahi thim
 Puri said that the Akhada branch is also in Allahabad and once upon a time, Pandit Motilal Nehru used to be a lawyer for the Akhara
 is akhaade main bhi 465 saal puraane bhawan ko todakar aadhunik ashram kaa nirmaan kiya ja rahaa he
 Ravindra Puri, the secretary of this arena of the Naga sect, also justifies the entry of grandeur into the ashram of the Nagas
 unhone kaha, ''mandiron ne hameshaa se desh kii sampatti kaa sangrakshan kiya he
 It is not the property of a particular person
 awaas ke liye bhavy ashram banaae ja rahe hai
 There are cars for travel needs
 khud jagadguru shankaracharya ne bhi kaha he ki desh-kaal-paristhiti ke anusaar vyavastha paraveerthan karnaa sanyasi kaa dharm he
 "saints and devotees of 22 states of the country are associated with this arena
 haridwar main hi akhaada kii 1,000 bigha jameen he to britain, america, switzraland or austria main akhaada kii shakhaaen hai
 Storytellers associated with the arena are doing storytelling here
 maujuuda keemton kaa akalan karen to desh bhar main faili akhaade kii sampatti 300 se 350 karod ru
 Sits between sampatti or raajnneeti kii jugalbandi ke sawaal par panchakula ke apane ashram se haridwar pravaas par aae june akhaada ke jagadguru panchanand giri maharaj haridwar main chal rahe dharmik gorakhdhandhe se khaase naaraaz najar aae
 He said, "the hypocritical sadhus have kept Bhagwat and Geeta as shopkeepers
 pichley kumbh main isi haridwar main karodon ru
 The titles of Mahamandaleshwar were sold to foreigners
 sanyas ke baad shaadi karaane ke naatak kumbh main hue
 If there are 2,000 ashrams in Haridwar, hardly 100 of these ashrams are engaged in religion, all the others have become traders
 ''baba ramdev kii ore ishaara karte hue unhone kaha, ''yoga se udyog kii taraf jane vaale kaa yahi haal hoga
 "all the faith is being transformed by the industrialization of religion
" isi kaa nateeja he ki ichhadhari baba jaise lanpat dharm kshetra main ghus aae hai
 If Sant Kabir comes to the earth again to see this jugalbandi of politics and religion, then perhaps he will wonder why he did not give the yes to King Sikander Lodhi
 or ashtchhaap ke bhakt kavi kumbhandas ko lagegaa ki raajnneeti ke jariye jab malaaidaar bhakthi ho rahi he to unhen kyon sikri main 'bisar gayo harinaam' kaa dar sata rahaa tha

 smartphone or internet par privesi yani niztaa or security aaj ke liye sabase badi samasya he
 There are millions of apps in smartphones and tabs, out of which we use many apps
 install karte vakt zyaadaatar log ye nahin dekhte ki wo ap aapke liye pareshaani kaa sabab ban saktaa he
 You have two options - either buy Android or Apple
 android ke mukaable aipal ke phone zyada sicyor hote hai
 But what if you have installed an app in iphone and it is spying on you? Is there trouble for you? There is an engineer from Google named Felix
 unhonecifhone main ek samasya dhundhi he
 According to him, the app installed in iphone can spy on the user
 jasusi karne ke liye wo divaais ke camera ko yuj karata he yani us ap ke develpar aapke hi smartphone camere se aap par najar rakh sakate hai
 For this, the app will need your permission, but by defaulting it, the developer can easily throw dust in your eyes
 is samasya ko pruv karne ke liye felics ne ek farji soshal media ap taiyara kiya
 This fake social media app was designed in such a way that it clicks the user's photo every second and uploads it on the website
 iske liye ap yujar kii ijaajat lene kii bhi jarurat nahin he
 According to the developer, the motive behind doing this is to focus on the privacy issue in the ios app
 aamtaur par ios main kisi ap install karne se pehle aapse parmishan maangi jaati he
 But later if you want, you can review some permissions of the app
 lekin is develpar kaa kahana he ki ek baar is ap ko aapane parmishan de di or baad main waapas le liya he phir bhi aise eps aapaki photo or videos capchar kar sakate hai
 How can you avoid this? According to the security blog, it can be avoided
 To protect yourself in free, the safe bet is to secure your device by taping the front camera
 kisi bhi aise aipas ke parmishan main ja kar usase camera parmishan rivok kar len yani waapas le lenkisi bhi ap main photo share karne yaa kisi ko tasviren yavideo bhejne ke liye aap image copy kar ke vahaan paste karen
 If there is support to copy and paste image in an app, then understand that it can prove to be dangerous for you
 kyonki iske liye aapako apni photo librari kaa acces dena hoga

 The Modi government has made amendments in the bill declaring triple talaq and punishing the punishment
 iske tahat ab trial se pehle peedita kaa paksh sunakar magistrate aaropee ko jamaanat de saktaa he
 Apart from the third person, only the victim's family and relatives can file an FIR against the divorcee
 modi sarkaar dwaara teen talaak bill main sanshodhano ke baad bhi ol india muslim personal lau board ise mahilaon kii jindagi ko barbaad karne vaala bill bataa rahaa he
 While the chairperson of the Mahila Muslim Personal Law Board, Shaista Amber, welcomed the bill, saying that it would have been better if the bill had been brought by consensus
 muslim personal lau board ke pravaktaa moulana khalid safulla rahamaani ne kaha- teen talaak vidheyak ko lekar jo aitraaj pehle tha wo aaj bhi kaayam he
 The government has done the mining only in the name of amendment
 muslim ulimaonse kisi tarah kaa koi vichaar-vimarsh nahin kiya gaya
 In such a situation, how can we approve this bill
 unhone kaha ki ham aaj bhi pehle kii tarah apni baat par kaayam he ki vidheyak ko pehle select cameti ko bheja jaae taaki jin binduon par apatti he
 They could be discussed
 rahamaani ne kaha ki is vidheyak ke aane se mahilaon ko jindagi main raahat milane ke bajaae barbaadi kaa sabab banegaa
 The Modi government's intention is not to improve the lives of Muslim women, but to do politics
 muslim mahila personal lau board kii adhyaksh shysta ambar kahati hai ki muslim mahilaayein talaak ke dar ke saae main jiti aa rahi hai
 In such a situation, i welcome the move of the Modi government to make laws
 lekin vidheyak main kuch khamiyaan hai jinhen sarkaar sanshodhan main dur karti to behatar tha
 Shaista Ambar says that the government should have kept the scope that there should be conciliation agreement if divorce happens
 is sambandh main hamane kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad or lau kamishan ke adhyaksh se mulaakaat karke kaha tha ki aap jo kanoon banane ke vidheyak laa rahe hai
 For this, in consultation with the Muslim Personal Law Board, Muslim Ulema, Islamic Scholars and women who voice the rights of Muslim women, they should bring a consensus and make laws so that Muslim women are protected from triple talaq
 modi sarkaar ye nahin kar saki
 He said that the law should be such that there can be fear of divorces within men
 aisa na ho ki muslim mahilaon ko isse jujhna pade
 The government is making a bill in such a way that even the open giver can face problems
 iske liye sarkaar aam sahmati banaae phir kanoon laae to behatar hoga
 jamaat-e-islami Hind general secretary Salim Engineer said that in this regard, our and our organization's opinion is on the opinion of the Muslim Personal Law Board
 sarkaar ne jo sanshodhan kiye hai wo uchit nahin he
 The government should first send this bill to the Select Committee
 bihar ke dipti siem tejasvi yadav kaa kahana he ki centre sarkaar ne 20 smart shaharon main bihar ke kisi shahar ko shaamil nahin karke rajya ke saath sautela vyavhaar kiya he
 Questions are also arising that out of the 20 cities selected by the Center, 9 are from BJP ruled states
 lekin kya vaaki bihar kii upeksha kii gai, kyonki sarkaar ne jis pariksha ko aadhaar banaakar yah chunaav kiya asal main unke aadhaaron par bihar kahin khara hi nahin utarataa he
 The truth is that an examination was conducted for the election of Orsmart cities of the Ministry of Urban Development
 iske liye sabase pehle rajyon ko apane shaharon kaa naam bataate hue yah spasht karnaa tha ki unhen kyon chunaa jaae? iske alaava vishesh samiti ne shahar kii jansankhya, vahaan maujuud suvidhaon, jeevanstyli or duusare karkon ke aadhaar par is suchi ko taiyaar kiya he
 But can the Bihar government also call the national capital Patna as a population-friendly facility? Probably not, because except for the other cities of the state, the government itself has not been able to make proper arrangements ranging from electricity, water to drainage in the city for the local residents in Patna
 prashasnic vyavastha to dur kii baat he
 It was also a measure of ministry
 
 
 karyanvayan kii vishwasaneeyata
 Under this, the basic needs such as electricity, water, traffic, internet facilities were evaluated along with construction plans, clearances, determination and collection of property tax in the last three years in the city
 bihar kii baat karen to nirmaan kii yojana or is ore manjuuri kii shuruaati prakriya main hi yahaan letlatifi koi nai baat nahin he
 Apart from this, the provision of easy and easy internet traffic in the major cities like the capital Patna to Muzaffarpur in the state still opens the policy distinction in the selection process
 mantralay kii samiti ne takreeban 1
 52 crore people also took their opinion regarding the election of cities
 nivaasiyon kii aakankshaon ke saath hi saarvajanik seva vitaran, mukhya aarthik gatividhi or samagrata par prabhaav ko bhi aanka gaya
 The Deputy Chief Minister, who was in power two months ago, has to understand that the truth of the economy and the government's efforts on this side is not hidden from anyone
 beete 10 varshon main na to rajya se palaayan kam hua he or na hi sarkaar rojgaar srijan ke saath hi nae kaarkaanon or vyapaar ke liye sugam rasta hi bana pai he
 Still, the state government is standing open to investors, but the administrative shortage is not making the right test for investment
 chayan prakriya main ek mahatvapurn aadhaar kam sansaadhan main smart samaadhaan, saarvajanik seva vitaran or nirmaan ke saath hi rakrakhaav bhi bada mudda tha
 The truth is that even here, there is nothing to tell the parts of Bihar
 nitish kii sarkaar sansaadhan kii kami kaa ronaa pehle se roti aa rahi he to har chote-bade shahar se aae dinirmaan or rakrakhaavako lekar dabangai se lekar jarjarata kii khabar aati rahati he
 Tejashwi will have to understand that politics does not mean just reaction to action
 samajhnaa yah bhi hoga smart shaharon kii suchi main aane se lekar khud ko nirbhar bananaa hoga
 It has to be worth it that the money received from the center can be properly utilized
 rajya ke chote nahin to kam se kam pramukh shaharon main aadharbhoot suvidhaon kii vyavastha kerani hogi
 There is also a need to curb bullying in crime and contracting
 or agar baat raajnneeti kii hi he to sambhavat: centre sarkaar ke paas acha mauka tha ki vah bengal, upi ke shaharon ko isamen shaamil kar leti, kyonki aane vaale dinon main uttar pradesh, bengal main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself comes from Varanasi in UP
 chayan kii pariksha par sawaal uthaane se pehle tejasvi shaayad yah bhul gaye ki modi sarkaar jis shivaraj singh ke shashan ko model bataati he, khud unke rajya ke bhopal ko top-20 main jagah banane main pasinaa aa gaya or vah antim number par rahi
 Tejashwi Yadav should pay attention to the government's action in the state and not get into fame by indulging in political backlash
 ek guzarish he
 
 
 
 ki kam se kam apane rajya kii behatar packaging or uske shandaar pregentation par bhi dhyaan den, taaki agali list main hamaraa bihar aa hi jaae
 a fourth person has also been arrested for allegedly sharing objectionable posts on social media against Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath

 kanaujia ke tivetor handle par likhaa he ki vah iiemasi or mumbai vishvavidhyalay ke chaatr rah chuke hai or kuch media sanghathanon se jude hai
 Digital India has a big appeal, but the mirror of what the reality is, Union Finance Minister Arjun Meghwal showed his own government
 hua yun ki mantriji bikaner ke dholiya gaanv ke daure par the, vahaan ke logon ne shikaayat kii ki unke aspataal main nurse nahin hai
 Arjun Meghwal immediately took out his mobile and tried to talk to the Chief Medical Officer of Bikaner, but the signal of the mobile was weak
 gaanvvaalon ne kaha ki ped par chadhane se signal mil saktaa he isliye mantriji ke liye seedhi mangvayi gai
 The ladder was placed on the support of the tree and climbing it, Arjun Meghwal instructed that a nurse be appointed in the hospital
 isse pataa chalata he ki digital india ke bhale oonche-oonche daawey kiye ja rahe hon, lekin kai jagah bina oonche ped par chadhe usamen shaamil hona aasaan nahin he

 haal hi main paanch rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav parinaamon ne nota kii bhoomika par charchaa ko ek baar phir se garma diya he
 In the media report, NOTA is said to be the key player in deciding the win-loss, but to get the facts of this media report tested, it is necessary to first study the trends of NOTA in the election results
 bharat nirvachan ayog ke aakado ke aadhaar par chhattisgarh main nota ko kul daale gaye maton kaa 2 pratishat (282744 mat) praapt hue he jo kii in paanch rajyon ke parinaamon main sabase zyada he
 Nota is sixth in terms of votes and is ahead of 7 political parties
 chhattisgarh ke pichley vidhansabha chunaavon main nota ke paksh main 3
 06 percent (401058 votes) was set in the national record of voting and NOTA was third
 mat pratishat ke aadhaar par yah record abhi tak achoota he or yah dikhaata he kii chhattisgarh main nota ke paksh me voting pehle bhi anya rajyon kii tulana main zyada hui he
 In Madhya Pradesh, voting in favor of NOTA 4 pratishat (542295 mat) hua or mat praapt karne ke maamle main nota chathe sthaan par rahaa or 6 raajnneetik dalon se aage rahaa he
 In the last assembly elections, NOTA had finished fourth and NOTA was ranked 1
 9 pratishat mat mili the, jo ki (643144 mat) the
 On this basis, the vote percentage of NOTA has decreased in Madhya Pradesh as compared to last time
 rajasthan main nota ke paksh main matdaan 1
 3 percent (467781 votes) and NOTA is sixth in terms of votes as well as ahead of 8 political parties
 pichley vidhansabha chunaavon main nota kii hissedari 1
 It was 9 percent (589923 votes) and was in the fifth position
 is tarah se rajasthan main bhi nota ke mat pratishat main giravat he
 Vote 0 in favor of NOTA in Mizoram
 5 pratishat (2917) mat hua he or mat praapt karne ke maamle main nota chathe sthaan par he saath hi ek party se aage he
 Nota in Mizoram in the last assembly general elections 0
 7 pratishat (8810 mat) praapt hue the or do rajnatik dalon se nota aage tha
 1 in favor of NOTA in Telangana as a new state
 1 pratishat (224709 mat) praapt hua he or rajnatik dalon main mat praapt karne main aathven sthaan par he or 8 anya rajnatik dalon se aage bhi he
 The last assembly elections in Telangana were held in 2014, with the general elections for the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly being the first phase
 aise main telugana rajya ke liye nota ke aankadon ko lekar spasht tulanaatmak adhyayan nahin ho paaegaa
 However, in the last assembly elections for the 294 assembly seats of entire Andhra Pradesh, NOTA got 0
 6 pratishat 308286 mat praapt hue the or mat praapt karne main nota naunve sthaan par tha
 In the last assembly elections for the first phase of 119 seats for Telangana, 152438 NOTA votes were received
 is baar akele telugana kii 119 vidhansabha siton ke liye nota ko 224709 mat kii prapti hui he
 Definitely 47 percent of the vote percentage of NOTA in Telangana
 4 pratishat kii badhottaree hui he

 ) NOTA was first used in elections in the 2013 assembly elections
 aise main aankadon kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan karne par hamen nota ke bare main jo rujhaan dikh rahe he, wo media dwaara nota ke bare main keval jeet-haar kaa nirnay karne vaale keval ek paksh ko prachaarit kar rahe he, jabaki nota ke kai anya gambhir rujhaan bhi he jinhen media ne tavajjon nahin di he
 The first trend is that NOTA has been effective in deciding the victory and defeat at the assembly level and media reports are also confirming this
 khaskar un vidhansabha kshetron ke parinaamon main jahaan jeet-haar kaa antar nota ko praapt maton ke yaa to aas-paas he yaa kam he
 Nota's decisive influence has diminished when Nota gets too many votes from the win-loss margin
 doosraa rujhaan ye he kii telugana main nota ke paksh main matdaan kii badhottaree ne ye dikhaaya he ki parinaamon ko nirdhaarit karne main nota maarak bhoomika nibhaa saktaa he
 But it is necessary to understand one thing here that due to the provisions of confidential voting, how is it being confirmed in the media report that the votes which have been voted in favor of NOTA, would have got the candidate coming second in the results
 He would have won
 abhi asal main gopneey matdaan ke praavdhaan ke chalate yah pataa lagaana sambhanv nahin he
 It may also be that the votes won by NOTA may have been cut from the vote bank of the candidate or the votes cast in NOTA should have come from the mass base of various political parties as seen in Telangana
 aise main yah kahana arthpurna nahin hoga ki nota main jo vot gaye ve keval parinaam main duusare number main rahane vaale ummidavaaron ko milane vaale the
 In such a case, there is no possible basis for such a report in the media, but a possible speculation
 vahiin teesraa rujhaan dikhaata he ki telugana ko chhodkar har rajya main nota ko samekit taur par pichhali vidhansabha kii tulana main kam mat mili he or matadaatao ne apane mat ko ummidavaaron ke paksh main hi zyada prayog kiya he
 Voting interest has declined in favor of NOTA
 isaki pushti chunaav ayog ke aankade kar rahe hai
 Despite this, nota has been ahead in getting votes from many state-level political parties this time too
 nota ke in chunavi rujhaanon ko dekhte hue yah mana ja saktaa he ki bhartiya chunaav pranali main nota rajnatik dalon or unke ummidavaaron ke liye chintaa kaa vishay ho saktaa he lekin chunaav ayog kaa lakshya raajnneetik dalon kii jeet-haar na hokar nota kaa praavdhaan kar, matadaata ko mataptr main ullekith ummidavaaron ko nakaar kar matdaan karne kaa loktantric vikalp uplabdh karana rahaa he or chunaav ayog apane is loktantric prayaas main bakhubi safal hua he

 ) The Modi government has given a rude shock to Muslims going on Haj pilgrimage
 centre sarkaar ne haj yatriyon ko milane vaali sabsidi khatm kar di he
 Every year one lakh 75 thousand Haj pilgrims were subsidized
 pichley saal centre sarkaar ne haj yatra par jane vaale musalamaanon par 405 karod rupye kharch kiye the
 This money was given as subsidy on rent
 centre sarkaar neni haj nitike tahat yah faisla liya he
 Earlier, the Modi government allowed Muslim women to perform Haj without Mehram
 kendriya mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne isaki jaankaree di
 He said that now the central government will not give subsidy to Haj pilgrims
 is saal ek lakh 75 hajaar musalmaan haj yatra par jane vaale he, , jabaki haj yatra ke liye chaar lakh musalamaanon ne aavedan kiya tha
 In addition, 1300 Muslim women will be allowed to go on Haj pilgrimage without Mehram
 mahila haj adhikari bhi in muslim mahilaon ke saath jaaengi
 Separate arrangements will be made for these to stay in Mecca and Medina
 nakvi ne kaha ki haj yatra ke liye milane vaali sabsidi kaa laabh garib or jaruratmand musalamaanon ko nahin miltaa tha
 In response to a question, he said that the Modi government has taken measures for poor Muslims going on Haj pilgrimage
 aazaadee ke baad yah pehali baar he, jab bhartiya musalmaan bina sabsidi ke haj yatra par jaaenge
 Union Minority Minister Naqvi said that Haj pilgrimage will be started by sea route in future
 unhone kaha ki ab haj sabsidi fund kaa istemaal alpsankhyak samudaay kii ladakiyon or mahilaon ko shiksha dene ke liye kiya jayega
 Earlier in Naqvi in mecca, Saudi Arabia, Dr
 Haj and Umrah Minister of Saudi Arabia Dr
 mohammad saleh bin taahir binaten ke saath haj-2018 ke sambandh main dwipaksheeya samjhaute par hastakshar kiye the
 During this time the Saudi Arabian government gave the green signal to resume the Haj pilgrimage from India by water ship
 vahiin, congress pravaktaa mim afjal ne kaha ki yah kahana puri tarah se galat he ki haj sabsidi fund se agenton or kuch companiyon ko phayda hota tha
 Connecting the matter to the self-esteem of the Muslims, he said that the Supreme Court had also directed to abolish the Haj subsidy gradually within 10 years
 upi sarkaar ke samay se hi haj sabsidi khatm karne kii disha main kaam kiya ja rahaa he, lekin modi sarkaar ne isko achaanak or behad jaldi khatm kar diya
 Modi government wants to give a strong message to Muslims by taking this decision so soon
 vahiin, bijepi pravaktaa shahanvaj hossain ne kaha kisaal 2012 se hi haj sabsidikhatm karne kii shuruyaat hui thi
 The Modi government has taken it forward
 unhone kaha ki ab haj sabsidi ke tahat kharch hone vaala paisa alpsankhyak samudaay kii mahilaon or ladakiyon ke shaikshanik vikaas ke liye kiya jayega
 It may be known that in the year 2012, the Supreme Court had directed the government to abolish the subsidy on Haj in the next 10 years

 Former captain Sourav Ganguly feels that India should have landed with two spinners in the fourth and final Test match against Australia as the conditions here are largely like the subcontinent
 tippaniyan Ganguly said India's acting captain Virender Sehwag made a mistake by keeping left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha out
 ganguli ne ‘da aij’ main apane kollam main likhaa he, ‘‘subah pich dekhne ke baad mujhe laga ki bharat ko do spinneron ke saath utarana chahie kyonki teen tej gendbaaj australian ballebaajon par dabaav nahin bana paye
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘bhartiya tej gendbaajon ne wicket bhi nahin liye or vah ranon kaa pravaah bhi nahin roak paae or isliye pragyan ojha ko is pich par utaarna sahi rahata
 The pitches in Melbourne, Sydney and Perth had a lot of movement but it is very close to the conditions in the subcontinent
 vah (ojha) har tarah kii paristhitiyon main acha pradarshan karata he or use is match main khelnaa chahie tha
 In the kind of heat, this pitch will start taking a turn
 ’’ aar aswin ke shuru main do wicket lene kaa udhaaharan pesh karte hue cricketer se camentator bane ganguli ne kaha ki ojha is pich par sahvaag ke liye achche vikalp ho sakate the

 He said, "indian fast bowlers did not even take wickets and they could not stop the flow of runs and therefore it would have been right to field Pragyan Ojha on this pitch
" melbern, sidney or perth kii pichon main kaaphi movement tha lekin yah upmahadweep kii paristhitiyon ke kaaphi kareeb he
 He (ojha) performs well in all kinds of situations and he should have played in this match
 jis tarah kii garmi he usamen yah pich turn lenaa shuru kar degi
 Giving the example of r Ashwin taking two wickets in the beginning, cricketer-turned-commentator Ganguly said that Ojha could have been a good choice for Sehwag on this pitch

 kab laga aapako ki acting main hi kariyar bananaa he?dekhie yah ek process tha dilli university ke college se theatre karte samay hi acting kii taraf meraa rujhaan ho gaya tha
 After that i joined NSD and diligently did theater and then came to Mumbai
 to yah ek process tha jo abhi bhi chal rahaa he
 With whom did Anand L
 Rai and Hansal Mehta learn to learn more? From the point of view of learning, every man teaches us something
 bas aapmen seekhney kii lalak honi chahie
 The style of working of both the directors is different, so a lot was learned from both
 aap film 'rais' main shahrukh khan ke saath najar aane vaale hai
 Explain your experience of working with Shahrukh Khan
 sabase pehle to bataanaa chaahunga ki shahrukh khan bachapan se mere fevorett actor rahe hai
 Working with Shahrukh Khan was nothing short of a dream
 vah apane kaam ke prati imaanadaaree se samarpit ek behtareen insaan hai
 The special thing about Shahrukh Khan is that whatever work he did in his life, he did it better
 misaal ke taur par jab vah college main footbal khelte the to vah team ke captain the
 Shahrukh Khan always used to top in terms of studies, so the thing to learn from him was that whatever work you do, do it with full hard work and honesty, you will get success
 'rais' main phir se aap ek saporting kirdaar main najar aane vaale he
 Don't you think you are being offered the same type of role? If i like the character, i don't care how my image is being made
 mere liye yah mahatvapurn he ki main apana kirdaar dhang se nibhaa paa rahaa hum yaa nahin
 i just want to roll well
 'rais' main main shahrukh ke dost ke kirdaar main dikhuunga jo pehle nibhaae gaye saporting kirdaaron se kaaphi alag or dilachasp he
 You are a graduate from NSD
 aisa kya kaaran he ki NSD (neshnal skool of drama) se aajkal kam actors bollywood main aa rahe hai?dekhie yah logon ke bich ek galat dharna he ki NSD se bollywood actors taiyaar kiye jate hai
 i would like to tell you that NSD was founded primarily to advance theater
 camere ke saamne acting ke liye FTII (film and televijan institute of india) banaaya gaya he
 So NSD prepares theater actors and not Bollywood actors, and there are many people of NSD graduates coming to Bollywood, who still want to do theater, have no attachment to films and are doing good work
 koi dream role jo aap karnaa chaahate hai?main theatre actor safadar hashmi or bhakpa ke yuva netaa chandrashekhar kaa role karnaa chaahunga
 Any special message to those who dream of coming into the industry? Just do your work with complete honesty
 industry main hi nahin jis bhi field main aap hai usamen agar aap puri mehnat va lagan se kaam karenge to safalataa aapako milegi

" ’’ Yaksha will leave the question of separatists in front of the separatists of Jammu and Kashmir, or will choose the path of confrontation with India can change the picture of Kashmir
 a big question is about the strategy of the separatist leaders of Kashmir now
 The Will these leaders be involved in mainstream politics, or will their old attitude with the Indian government continue
 agar vikalpon kii baat karen to in kashmiri algaavvaadi netaaon ke saamne do-teen vikalp bachate hai
 These leaders abandon the demand for perceived independence and join mainstream politics and contest elections, continue to oppose the Indian government as before and persist with the demand for independence, or declare armed struggle like terrorists
 bataa den ki is vakt centre sarkaar ne jammu-kashmir ke pramukh algaavvaadi netaaon par kanoonee shikanja kas diya he
 JKLF chairman Yasin Malik is currently lodged in Tihar Jail in connection with several cases
 mahila alagavadavadi sanghathan dakhtarin-e-millat kii chif asia andrabi, ol party hurriyat conference ke general secetry mashrat alam or shabbir shah bhi tihaad jail main band hai
 These leaders are accused of money laundering and involvement in terrorist activities
 in algaavaadiyon ke khilaaf sarkaar kisi tarah ke narmi ke mood main nahin dikh rahi he
 Will the separatists return to the mainstream? According to media reports in the last few days, intelligence agencies have pointed out that many leaders of the separatist camp are now stubbornly planning to go with the government
 in netaaon ko aagaah ho gaya he ki bharat virodh kii unki ranneeti zyada dinon tak kargar nahin hone vaali he
 If we look at the reports coming through the Hurriyat sources, it shows that the younger generation of Hurriyat leaders now want to join mainstream politics
 padhein: algaavvaadiyon ke khel kaa khulaasa, aatank failaane ke liye hafiz se lete the karodonkun bharegaa PDP or neshnal conference kii jagah?jammu-kashmir main is vakt sthaneey raajnneetik dal haashie par hai
 When Article 370 was removed from here, President's rule was in force in the state
 is vajah se is faisle ko rajya kii samvidhan sabha se paas karaane kii majaburi bhi nahin thi
 Since this decision, the big leaders of PDP and National Conference have been under house arrest or in the position of house arrest
 centre sarkaar ke ravaiye ke virodh main vahaan ho rahe chunaavon kaa bhi pramukh sthaneey raajnneetik dalon ne bahishkaar kiya he
 However, many strictures are being relaxed in the state
 kashmir main ek baar raajnneetik prakriya shuru hote hi yahaan upje political vaikum ko bharne ke liye naye chehron kii jarurat hogi
 The younger generation of separatists have the option to fill this empty space
 aisa isliye kyonki in netaaon ke bharat virodh kaa koi ateet nahin he
 One morning in Kashmir (photo-getty IMAGE) The government of Northeast's Fund of India in Kashmir also has an option to include these separatists in the mainstream itself
 yahaan purvottar ke algaavvaadi sanghathanon kaa zikr karnaa jaruri he
 The present Narendra Modi government has mainstreamed leaders of several separatist organizations in Nagaland
 iske liye sabase pehali shart he ki ye algaavvaadi netaa pakistan se apane saare samparkon ko khatm karen, or bharat virodh kii raajnneeti ko puri tarah se chhod den
 However, it is possible to do the same with those separatists who are not facing any serious allegations
 is prakriya ko follow karne main centre sarkaar ko lanbaa samay lag saktaa he
 Development will change the picture, the separatists will be redundant
 If the environment in Jammu and Kashmir is good in the next few years and there is a large investment, tourism picks up, then there is bound to be prosperity in the lives of people, it will directly affect the thinking of the people
 Will fall on hansi-khushi janata aasaani se algaavvaadiyon ke bahekaave main nahin aegi, aisi haalat main algaavvaadi khud apana vajood kho denge
 Let us tell you that terrorism has been controlled on the basis of strict law and order in Punjab, but when prosperity comes in the lives of the people there, they left the path of terror on their own

 The battle between Kamat and Sanjay Nirupam has been going on for the last several years

 Your success also depends on how your relationship with office colleagues and how you keep pace
 vahiin offis main kuch sahakarmi aise bhi hote hai jo lagaataar aapaki khaamiyon ko ginate rahenge taaki bos kii najar main aapaki nakaaratmak chhavi ban jaae
 If you have such people in your office, then you should use these methods to avoid them
 bartaav ko samajhane kii koshish karenophis main logon ko samajhane kii koshish karen
 Understand the behavior of the front and think if that person is deliberately harassing you? If this is the case, stay away from it
 kitne bhi ho skild, offis ke pehle din bhuulakar bhi naa karen ye galtiyanbhul jaaen ki koi aap par dhaus jamaa rahaa haijab aap confident hai to aapako kisi se darane kii jarurat nahin he
 You know your work well and know how to do it
 ek cheez yaad rakhen, agar offis main aapako har samay dabaaya jaataa he, yaa dadagari dikhaai jaati he to sirf aap apane kaam se un sabakaa munh band kar sakate hai
 If these are quality in you, there will never be a job shortage
 Do not listen against yourself
 Without any reason, a colleague is saying wrong about you, then do not listen to him at all
 agar vah aapke senior hai, to unhen vinamrata se samajha sakate hai ki aisa naa karen
 Do not talk by shouting angrily or abusing
 shant or sulajhe hue swar main saamne vaale ko chup rahane ke liye bol den
 When the daily routine becomes the shout of the boss, then keep yourself in a diary of cool behavior
 On what day you were treated unfairly, record all accounts in a diary
 ghatana kii taarikh, samay, jagah or gavaah ke naam (agar koi us vakt aapke saath tha ) jab aap apane suparvizer ko yaa apane bos ko galat bartaav ke bare main jaankaree denge tab ye report bahut kaam aaengi
 When the daily routine becomes the shout of the boss, then keep yourself calm and wait and keep your time in front of the boss with all the evidence
 bos ke paas imotional hokar shikaayat lekar na jaaen
 Your boss may think that you are making a mountain of rye
 shant or profeshnal tareeke se apni baat bos ke saamne rakh kar apana paksh majboot karen

 The latest calendar issued by the Rajya Sabha has come under controversy
 is par samvidhan kii jo prastaavna likhi he, usamen 'secular' or 'samaajawaadee' shabd gaayab hai
 The Congress has strongly objected to this
 jaahir he ki isse nae sire par samvidhan kii prastaavna par bahes chhid sakati he
 Remember that recently, bjp's ally Shiv Sena had demanded removal of both these words from the Constitution
 haalanki rajyasabha ne apane calendar kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki yah koi galati nahin thi
 Gurdeep Sappal, the OSD (officer on Special Duty) of Rajya Sabha Chairman Vice President Hamid Ansari, told Mail Today that the calendar is part of the History and Heritage series, under which the original historical documents of the Constitution are being reprinted, Nandlal Bose decorated with his own hands
 aisa isliye hua kyonki samvidhan kii prastaavna kii ekmaatr hastlikhit or sajaavati prati aisi he, jisamen ye donon shabd nahin hai
 The reason for this is that in 1950 both these words were not in the constitution
 apatkaal ke dauraan 42wein sanshodhan main samvidhan kii prastaavna main badlaav kiya gaya or ye shabd jode gaye
 But the Modi government is printing the original documents of the constitution in this series, which does not contain these words
 telecom mantri ravishankar prasad ne 'mail today' se kaha, 'congress ke jo log is par bavaal kar rahe hai ve is aasaan se sawaal kaa jawaab den
 The people involved in the work of the Constitution were very capable and intelligent people
 unhone hamen samvidhan ke rup main jeeta-jaagta dastavej diya
 Was Nehru not secular? Were not other great freedom fighters secular? If even then he did not include both these words in the constitution, then there must be some reason for this
 hamen congress se poochna chahie ki unhone aisa kyon nahin kiya? 1976 se pehle kya ham secular raashtra nahin the? indira gandhi 1971 se 1976 tak satta main thim
 Was she not secular then? ”she further said that the Modi government believes in 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' and 'jan Dhan Yojana' is an example of this, in which we have connected every section of the society
