 simon tuffel ne kaha ki us vakt jo mode tha wo kaaphi najuk tha, aise main ampiron kaa dhyaan ballebaaj kahaan daud rahaa vahaan nahin, balki gend kahaan se uth rahi he- vahaan par tha
 However, the TV replays took notice of the batsmen's race
 aapako bataa den ki simon tuffel kii ginati cricket kii duniya ke sabase bade ampiron main se hoti rahi he
 However, he no longer umpires in international matches
 lekin ICC kii us cameti kaa hissaa he jo cricket ke niyam banaati he
 Simon Tuffel has been the ICC Umpire of the Year five times
 kya kahata he cricket kaa niyam?simon tuffel ke is bayaan ke baad is mudde par bahes phir se tej ho gai he
 Now if you pick up the ICC rulebook and look at the rules, then see what the result is
 niyam sankhya 19
 8: Deliberate run by overthrow or fielder- Any run of penalty is given to both teams
 - agar thro phenkane ke vakt tak ballebaaj ran puraa karne ke liye daudta he, to vah ran boundry yaa overthro ke saath joda jayega
 Actually, the ball is being disputed
 wo england ke pari ke aakhri over kii chauthi gend he
 Batting on this ball, Ben Stokes hit the shot and ran for two runs, in the meantime, Martin Guptill threw to the keeper, who went straight to Stokes' bat
 unke balle par lagakar ye gend sidhaa boundry ke paar chali gai or england ko 6 ran (2+4) mili
 After this run, the England team was able to bring itself to the position of super over
 baad main super over taai hua or boundry ke aadhaar par england world champion ban gai

 teen talaak, halaala ke baad ab supreme court main ek or yachika daakhil hui he jisamen islam ke naam par chand tara vaale hare jhande lahraane par pabandi lagane kii maang kii gai he
 Petitioner Wasim Rizvi argues that this flag of the Muslim Muslim with the mark of Chandatara on green cloth has nothing to do with Islamic beliefs
 na to haraa rang or naa hi chandthara islam ke abhinn ang hai
 This is the flag of the political party of the enemy country
 isse miltaa-julata pakistan kaa jhanda he orislamke naam par aise jhande lahraane vaale darasal pakistan ke saath khud kaa judaav mahasoos karte hai
 The pre-independence flag is still issued by Wasim Rizvi, chairman of the UP UP Central Waqf Board, in his petition, appealing to the Supreme Court that the flag actually belonged to the Muslim League formed in 1906 which ended in 1946
 desh ke bantwaare ke jimmedaaron main se ahm kirdaar nibhaane vaali muslim lig ne 1947 main pakistan main nayaa chola pahana or nae naam ke saath, lekin apana jhanda or nishaan vahi chandthara vaala har jhanda rakhaa
 He said that the party came to be known as the Muslim League quaid-e-azam with the same green moon star flag
 pakistan kaa jhanda bhi muslim lig ke jhande main hi ek safed pattee lagaakar taiyaar kiya gaya
 In the name of Islam, hoisting such flags on the roofs of buildings is in fact a violation of the constitution, independence and sovereignty of our country
 samvidhan isaki katai ijaajat nahin detaa ki log dharm yaa secularism kii aad main dushman desh kii ek khaas raajnneetik party kaa jhanda apane gharon, imaaraton yaa anya saarvajanik jagahon par fahraaen

 On Wednesday, on the petition of Swaraj Abhiyan, the Supreme Court has made very strict remarks in the case of deaths due to malnutrition in Maharashtra
 court ne kaha he ki aapako kya lagata he ham yahaan maje lene ke liye baithe hai
 This comment of the court is telling how deep the frustration is becoming
 acha he kuposhan ke shikaar log twitor ke time line par nahin hai varna roj negative baton se mulk kaa mizaaj kharaab ho rahaa hota
 The Supreme Court stated that hamane media report dekhi he ki maharashtra main 500-600 bacchon kii kuposhan se maut hui he
 You think that in a country with a large population, some people die of malnutrition does not matter
 pakistan ke don akhbaar kii aktubar 2015 kii khabar he ki sindh praant ke ek jile main 143 bachche kuposhan se mar gaye the
 According to a newspaper in February 2016, 2599 children suffering from malnutrition have been admitted to hospitals in the same district within four months
 tippaniyan When Abdul Satta Edhi, who dedicated his life to the poor in Pakistan, passed away, thousands of people gathered at the National Stadium in Karachi for his last visit
 jis pakistan ko ham aatank kaa garh samajhate hai vahaan ek hero aisa bhi tha jo garibi ke khilaaf ladata hua hero bana tha
 Al Jazeera wrote that when Edhi Sahab was set up in July, when more than a million people came to his funeral
 unka rashtriya sammaan ke saath antim sanskaar kiya gaya
 The army also saluted
 idhi sahab gujarat ke rahane vaale the or 1947 main pakistan gaye
 If India and Pakistan have to fight the war on poverty then what can be their strength? uske nayak koun ho sakate hai
 The worldwide economic gap is widening
 ek pratishat logon ke kabze main aadhi duniya ke baraabar kii sampatti aa gai he
 The real fight against poverty should be with those one percent of the rich, but still when the matter has been done, what risk can be taken in this uproar that India and Pakistan should jointly declare war on poverty

 Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) president Lalu Prasad said on Saturday that the government's tussle in Bihar has opened up with the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)
 isaki jaanch jaruri he
 Lalu said in a conversation with journalists in Patna that after April 24, he will remain in Bihar and go to different areas and know the well being of the people
 lalu ne media par bhi nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki media yahaan sarkaar kaa 'mouthpis' banakar rahaa gaya he
 If reporters want to write anything against the government, then the editors have met the government, due to which it does not print the news
 lalu ne kaha ki yahaan loktantr nahin rajtantr chal rahaa he
 He said that today agriculture has collapsed in Bihar, industries have collapsed, the law and order situation is pathetic, yet it is being said that Bihar has surpassed America
 lalu ne sieji kii report ke bare main kaha ki rajya main bade paimaane par sarkari dhan kii lut hui he, or isaki jaanch jaruri he
 But by not doing so, the government is pressing the entire matter
 unhone yaad dilaayaa ki sieji kii rapat par hi 2ji jaise ghataale kaa pataa chalaa
 In response to a question about the dispute between the army and the government, Lalu said that the matter was being blamed in vain
 rajasthan ke bharat-pakistan antarrashtriya seemaa ke najadik ek ajibo-garib yantra milane se khalabali much gai he, yah yantra ko phulasar gaanv ke kareeb mila he
 The big question is how this device reached here despite the alert in the border area
 upkaran ko sandigdh maanate hue jaanch shuru ho gai he

 The judges said that the government could not lease the land, lake and historic building for 99 years

 Every person was questioning that when the government spent between 35 and 40 crores on the lake and the land around it
 kharch kar sakati he, to aitihaasik imaarat par vah bhi kharch karke uskaa rakh-rakhaav apni sampatti ke taur par kyon nahin kar leti, jaise vah mount abu kii nakki jhil kaa karti he

 It was being said that the inexperienced batting of the Australian team would be seen struggling against the Indian spin duo
 yah mana ja rahaa tha ki sabase kam test main 250 wicket lekar world record banane vaale aswin to behad maarak sabit honge, lekin bengaluru test main tamilnadu ke is of spinner kaa pradarshan feekaa sa rahaa

 bengaluru test ke tisare din team india yadi australian pari ko 276 ran par sametane main safal rahi to iskaa shrey jadeja ke chah wicket ko jaataa he
 Interestingly, on the first day, when Team India's innings ended on 189 runs, the maximum number of hopes were being given to Ashwin
 pehle din ke khel ke baad lokesh rahul ne vishwaas ke saath kaha tha ki aswin kii gendbaaji ke aage australian ballebaaji dhwast ho jaaegi
 However, while Ashwin took two wickets in the innings, Jadeja took six wickets

 jab vipakshi team kaa puraa dhyaan ravichandran ko saavdhaanee se khilne par kendrit hota he tab jadeja haule se aakar vipakshi ballebaajon ke 'dephence ko bhed' jate hai
 The specialty of Jadeja as a bowler is that he is very accurate
 aam left arm spinneron kii tulana main unki genden kuch zyada gati liye hoti hai or isi kaaran ve wicket se bharpoor oochaal paane main safal hote hai
 Another feature of this Gujarat cricketer is that he reads the mood of the wicket soon and according to that, he successfully carries out his 'bowling plan'

 Pujara once said, you can call Jadeja the 'shadow' of Anil Kumble
 agar aap unka saamana kar rahe hai to har gend ko saavdhaanee se khelnaa hoga
 Jadeja keeps the line-length extremely accurate and that is why he is successful in taking wickets

 BJP, facing 16 years of anti-incumbency, has many other challenges
 ek to patidaar andolan ke netaa hardik patel har manch se bijepi ke khilaaf taal thonk rahe hai
 Recently, the Dalit class is also very angry due to the rise of cow vigilantes and its young leaders are also emerging and the biggest thing is the face of Narendra Modi, who has the potential to unite all Gujaratis in the name of Gujarati identity

 darasal, ab in khaas dinon par unhen chuttee di ja sakati he
 UT Chandigarh Police IG RP Upadhyay has decided that all the policemen of Chandigarh Police will be given a chance to live with their families and loved ones by resting from duty on the day of their birthday and anniversary
 chandigarh polisaki ore se jari press relies ke mutabik, pulicekarmiyon ke kaam kii prakruti swaabhaavik rup se tanaavpurn hoti he
 They have to work for long hours on duty, on weekends and even on vacation days and their duties are constantly changing
 iske parinamswaroop adhiktar pulicekarmi apane nijee jivan ke khaas maukon jaise ki janmdin or shaadi kii saalagirah kaa jashn nahin manaa pate
 However, policemen who are not married, who are divorced widows or widowers, can use this day off on any other special occasion related to their life in lieu of the anniversary of Koshadi
 - input bhashaa Hearing of a defamation suit against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on behalf of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Rajiv Babbar has been postponed by Delhi's Rouse Avenue Court till the Lok Sabha elections are over
 manahani ke is cese main arvind kejariwal ko mangalvaar ko pesh hona tha
 As soon as the hearing of the case started, the lawyers appearing for Kejriwal said that today the Chief Minister is not in Delhi, he is in Haryana for campaigning
 lihaaja court main sunwaayee ke dauraan vyaktigat peshi se kejariwal ko chhot di jaae
 After handing over the Chief Minister's program on behalf of Kejriwal's lawyer in the court, the court exempted Kejriwal from appearing
 court ab is maamle kii agali sunwaayee 7 june ko karegaa
 Apart from Kejriwal, AAP MP Sushil Gupta, party leader Atishi and AAP MLA Manoj Kumar were also asked to appear in the case
 court ne kaha he agali taarikh main sabhi ko pesh hona hoga
 It was alleged that the Chief Minister tried to incite people against the BJP on social media
 votaron ko jhooth bolaa ki vaisya or kuch or jatiyon kaa vot bijepi ne katwa diya he
 Rajiv Babbar has said in his petition that this has been done deliberately as part of a conspiracy to completely concoct and defame the BJP
 jisamen dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal or unki party ke kuch netaa shaamil hai
 Rajiv Babbar has said in his petition that Kejriwal had tweeted on 8 December 2018, claiming that the Agarwal Samaj has a total of eight lakh votes in Delhi
 aam aadmi party ke netaaon ne daawa kiya tha ki unamem se lagbhag chaar lakh vot bhaajapa ne katwa die
 Means 50 percent
 aaj tak yah samaaj bhaajapa kaa kattar voter tha
 This time because of demonetisation and GST, they are angry, BJP only cut their votes
 haalanki chunaav ayog ne aam aadmi party ke is daawey ko khaarij kar diya tha, is cese main chunaav ayog kii taraf se die gaye halafname main saaf kar diya gaya ki jati dharm ke aadhaar par vah votaron kaa data apane paas rakhte hi nahin he
 Apart from this, the Election Commission is an independent body and no political party can pressurize it
 bijepi netaa rajeev babbar ne kejariwal or anya ke khilaaf aapraadhik manahani kaa mukadmaa daayar kiya tha, court ne pichhali taarikh par saman bhejkar kejariwal samet tamaam aropiyon ko court main pesh hone kaa aadesh diya tha
 The next hearing of the case will be on 7 June

 The Haryana Congress has fielded women candidates for 10 per cent of the seats being held in 90 assembly seats
 BJP has made 12 women
 Assembly candidates demand definite participation of women in electoral politics is often a matter of discussion
 lekin jab chunaav kaa vakt aata he to raajnneetik dalon or unke netaaon ke aise bayaan mahaj jumale banakar rah jate hai
 Be it the Bharatiya Janata Party or the Congress, the participation of women in the ticket distribution of all parties is rarely seen
 khaskar, mahilaon ke liye 33 fisadi aarakshan kii maang karne vaali congress bhi is fehrist main peeche hi najar aati he
 If we look at the list of candidates fielded for the upcoming assembly elections in Haryana, the number of women there seems to be very less
 congress ne 90 siton vaali haryana vidhansabha chunaav ke liye mahaj 9 siton par mahilaon ko tikat die hai
 That is, only 10 percent women have been given the opportunity to participate in the assembly
 sattadhari bhartiya janata party kii sthiti bhi kamobesh congress jaisi hi he
 However, the BJP is slightly ahead of the Congress in giving tickets to women
 party ne 90 siton main se 12 par mahila pratyaashiyon ko chunaav ladane kaa avasar diya he
 Regional parties in giving tickets to women The two main parties of the Congress, Congress and BJP, may not have shown great heart in giving tickets to women, but the position of regional parties is better in this case
 inelo ne is baar 15 mahila pratyaashiyon par bharosa jataayaa he
 However, JJP has given tickets to only 7 women
 lekin congress kii baat kii jaae to usne 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav se bhi kam mahilaon ko chunaav ladane kaa mauka diya he
 The Congress gave 10 tickets in 2014, out of the 9 women who were given tickets by the Congress in this election, 3 are those who won the 2014 assembly elections
 party ne narayangarh se style, samaura (surakshit) se renu bala, yamunanagar se nirmala chouhan, narwanaa (surakshit) se vidya rani, ulakaana (surakshit) se bala devi, tosham se kiran choudhary, kalanur (surakshit) se shakuntla khatak, jhajjar (surakshit) se gita bhukkal or ambala kaint se venu singla agarwal ko tikat diya he
 Haryana: Angry leaders lock office, Congress candidates sit on dharna In 2014, Congress won Geeta Bhukkal from Jhajjar, Kiran Chaudhary from Tosham, Shakuntala Khatak from Kalanaur, Manveer Kaur from Kalka, Sumita Singh from Assandh, Vidya Rani from Narwana, Hisar Savitri Jindal from Ateli, Anita Yadav from Ateli, Kailasho Saini from Ladwa and Dr
 from Yamunanagar
 krishna pandit ko chunavi maidan main utaara tha
 Among them, Geeta Bhukkal from Jhajjar, Kiran Chaudhary from Tosham and Shakuntala Khatak from Kalanaur managed to win
 bijepi kii baat kii jaae to pichley chunaav main party ne congress se zyada 15 mahila ummidavaaron ko maidan main utaara tha, jinamein se 8 mahilaon ne jeet darj kii thi
 Apart from this, BSP 6, HJC 5, Halopa 12 and 33 women as independents had contested

 ganit ek aisa vishay he jise kai bachche to behad pasand karte hai to vahiin kuch is vishay se behad khauf main rahete hai
 You too must have told your child that this is a scoring subject in order to generate interest in this subject
 is vishay par thodi se mehnat karne par aap aasaani se phul marks laa sakate hai
 But at that time are you really understanding your child's mood? bataa den, bacchon par is vishay ko lekar jarurat se zyada dabaav banane par wo tanaav main aane lagata he
 Because of this, after a while, they hate the subject
 haal hi main hui ek study kii maane to bacchon main maths ke liye badhati nafrat kii vajah se ab wo 'maths anzity' kaa bhi shikaar hone lage hai
 a study conducted by the Center for Neuroscience in Education revealed that most children are suffering from stress due to maths
 is study main bacchon ke mata pita or skool teachers ko unke tanaav kaa kaaran bataaya gaya
 The research was conducted on 1000 Italian children and 1700 London-based children
 in adhyan ko acchhee tarah karne ke baad shodhakarta is nattejey par pahunche ki primary or secondary skool main padhane vaale ladakon kii tulana main ladkiyaan maths anzity kii zyada shikaar hoti hai
 The study also revealed that this happens because children already understand the subject as difficult
 jisaki vajah se unhen tanaav hone lagata he
 Apart from this, the fear of getting less organs in this subject also does not let them overcome this tension
 is shodh ko karne vaale denis kehete hai, ' ye sach he ki 'maths anzity' har bachche main alag kaaran se ho sakati he lekin hamane apni research ke madhyam se kuch aise kaaran khoj liye hai jo primary or secondary donon bacchon main ek samaan hai
 'another thing that came out in this research was that the style of teaching of teachers in school
 ji haa, is study main khud bacchon ne is baat kii shikaayat kii he ki unke skool main is vishay ko alag-alag dhang se padhaayaa jaataa he jiske chalate wo aksar kanphyus ho jate hai
 Secondary school children said that they are stressed due to poor relationships with parents and friends
 iske alaava har class ke saath padhai ke badhate dawaab kii vajah se bhi bacchon ko tanaav ho rahaa he
 By the way, it is surprising that children who are strong in maths also feel stressed on many occasions
 darasal jo bachche maths main achche hote hai, unke parents ko hameshaa sirf unke marks se hi matlab hota he
 By doing this, the stress gradually increases in those children and they are not able to perform in future even in the field where they are better
 shodhakartaaon kii maane to wo is badhate trend ko kaaphi chintajanak maanate hai
 According to him, children get caught in this kind of cycle
 jahaan se bhavishya main unka nikalnaa bahut mushkil hoga
 According to him, children will not perform well due to maths environment first and then suffer from stress due to lower marks
 is study main shodhakartaaon ne is pareshaani ko hal karne ke liye kuch mahatvapurn vikalpon par bhi jor diya gaya he
 He told that in order to get rid of this problem, first of all the teachers of the school have to accept that children can also become victims of maths envy
 jiskaa sidhaa asar unki parformens par padataa he
 Apart from this, teachers should also bring necessary changes in their style of teaching children
 itnaa hi nahin bacchon ke mata- pita bhi is baat kaa khyaal rakhen ki maths ke liye bacchon par dawaab banane se bacchon par iskaa bura asar pad saktaa he
 Researchers hope that if these solutions are implemented, the situation can be improved soon
 unhone is baat ko bhi sweekaar kiya ki vartmaan sthati kaaphi chintajanak he
 According to a research, one in every five people in the UK have difficulty solving math problems

 Ravichandran Ashwin may prove to be a difficult bowler for the England batsmen but his spin partner Ravindra Jadeja has said that it depends a lot on which team is dominating the match
 jadeja ne moin ali kaa zikr karte hue kaha, ‘ham jab england gayi the tab to unke spinner aise hi lag rahe the ki muralidharan gend daal rahaa he
 'everyone sitting on it started laughing
 aswin tisare bhartiya cricketer hai jinhone ek hi satr main 500 ran banaae hai or 50 wicket chatkaaye hai
 Asked if Ashwin's threat was working on the minds of England's top order batsmen, Jadeja said, "in Test cricket, a lot depends on the situation
" agar aapaki team acchhee sthiti main he to nishchit rup se vipakshi team jujhegi
 In my opinion, if the team has an edge, then the batsmen and bowlers of that particular team will look more dangerous
 ’tippaniyan When Johnny Bairstow was asked the same question that Ashwin is also dominating Alastair Cook's mind, he defended his captain, saying, "first thing, Cook is the top runner in terms of the most runs scored by any Test batsman
" Arrived at 10
 isaliye mujhe nahin lagata ki is sandarbh main koi zyada pareshaani he
 He has scored long runs against any invasion of the world
 ’ (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Ashwin is the third Indian cricketer to score 500 runs in a single season and take 50 wickets

 If your team is in good condition then the opposition team will definitely suffer
 meri raay main agar team ne badhat banaai hui he to us vishesh team ke ballebaaj or gendbaaj zyada khatarnaak dikhaai denge

 com / bnbntvtqip fadanvis sarkaar ko shivasena-ncp-congress ne di chunautikarnataka main yediurppa sarkaar ko congress ne kiya tha chalangecort ne 2018 main yediurppa ko diya tha floor test kaa aadeshimotional bhaashan ke baad bies yediurppa ne diya tha istifamaharashtra main siyaasi tasviir teji se badal rahi he
 Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Saturday administered oath to Devendra Fadnavis as Chief Minister and Ajit Pawar as Deputy Chief Minister
 congress, rashtravaadi congress party or shivasena ne supreme court main ise chunauti di he
 a bench of Justice NV Raman, Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice Sanjeev Khanna is scheduled to hear the matter on Sunday
 raajnneetik ghatnakram jis tarah se aage bad rahaa he, usase lag rahaa he kimaharashtra kii siyasatus mode par pahunch gai he, jahaan 2018 main karnataka kii raajnneeti pahunchi thi
 Maharashtra was under President's rule but no one imagined what happened on Saturday morning
 devendra fadanvis ne siem pad kii shapath le lee
 This surprised everyone in the entire political corridor
 shaam hote-hote yah maamla supreme court pahunch gaya
 Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP have filed a petition in the Supreme Court regarding the new government in Maharashtra and demanded the cancellation of the order of Governor Bhagat Singh Kosari, in which he invited Devendra Fadnavis to form the government in the state
 supreme court teenon dalon kii yachika par sunwaayee karegi
 This hearing will be held in Court No
 2 of the Supreme Court at 11:30 am today
 supreme court main daakhil yachika main shivasena, congress or ensipi ne 288 sadasyeey maharashtra vidhansabha main 154 vidhayakon ke samarthan kaa daawa bhi kiya
 The three parties requested the Supreme Court that the court should convene a special session of the assembly on Sunday and direct the floor test as soon as possible
 isse yah spasht ho jayega ki bahumat uddhav thakare ke paas he yaa devendra fadanvis ke paas
 What happened in Karnataka in 2018? Now the question is whether the political incident cycle of Maharashtra has reached where the politics of Karnataka reached in 2018
 asal main, 2018 main karnataka main vidhansabha chunaav ke baad rajyapal vajubhai vaala ne sabase badi party bijepi ko sarkaar banane ke liye aamantrit kiya or bijepi netaa bies yediurppa ne mukhyamantri ke taur par shapath lee
 The governor invited BJP to form the government, the party that won the most seats
 lekin congress or jedies ne iskaa virodh kiya he or supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataya
 Both parties demanded a floor test immediately before the Supreme Court
 supreme court ne mukhyamantri pad kii shapath le chuke bies yediurppa ko apana bahumat sabit karne kaa aadesh diya
 During that time, BJP had 104 mlas in Karnataka and it was believed that it is not easy for it to break the Congress and JDS mlas
 isse pehle rajyapal ne yediurppa ko vidhansabha main bahumat sabit karne ke liye 15 dinon kaa vakt diya tha
 On this, the Congress said that by doing this the Governor has cleared the way for the purchase and sale of mlas
 baad main congress ne ise supreme court main chunauti di or adaalat ne kaha ki 19 may 2018 ko shaam chaar baje hi bahumat sabit karnaa hoga
 The BJP government could not face the floor test in the assembly and Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa resigned
 iske baad congress-jedies gathbandhan kii sarkaar banikarnataka main bijepi ne khub koshishen kin or lagaataar maahaul banaaya ki uske paas congress or jedies ke kuch vidhayakon kaa samarthan he
 But in the end, all this was lost
 19 may ko karnataka vidhansabha main bahumat sabit karne se pehle yediurppa ne vidhansabha main imotional bhaashan diya or phir istife kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Meaning that they did not have a majority
 ab aisi hi tasviir maharashtra main banati hui dikh rahi he
 However, it remains to be seen what the Supreme Court pronounce on the plea of nationalist Congress and Shiv Sena
 baharhaal, faisla chaahe jo ho lekin maharashtra kii siyasat kaa kanoon kii galiyon se hokar guzarane ke ghatnakram par sabaki nigahen tiki hui hai
 Shobha Ojha, President of the All India Mahila Congress, demanded the resignation of Union Minister Nihalchand Meghwal on Friday
 meghavaal dushkarm ke ek maamle main kathitarup se shaamil hai
 Ojha told media persons here, 'we demand the resignation of Nihalchand Meghwal, as he can influence the hearing against him in the rape case if he continues as the Union Minister
 ' Ojha said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi not taking action against his minister is astonishing
 jabaki vah mahilaon kii suraksha or sammaan se sambandhit maamalon ke liye baar-baar chintaa prakat karte hai
 Ojha said, "during the election, the whole country heard Modi making big promises for women's safety
 or ab dushkarm ke aaropee apane mantri par maun hai

 agra ke ek nijee aspataal ke swaagat kaksh ke baahar shanivaar shaam ek bam dhamaakaa hua jisamen teen log ghayal ho gaye
 However, it is not yet clear whether the terrorists are behind the blast in the 70-bed Jai Hospital or whether it is the handiwork of a criminal group
 gauratlab he ki yah aspataal tajmahal se teen kilometre kii duuri par sthit he
 Earlier reports said that six people were injured in the blast
 tasveeron main dekhen tajanagari main hua dhamakapulice kai binduon par jaanch kar rahi he jisamen kisi marij ke timaardaar kaa haath hone yaa aspataal ke karmchaariyon se kisi ke ranjish hone kii baat bhi shaamil he

 On the other hand, Tiwari also ruled out the possibility of using tiffin for the blast and said that tiffin may belong to a patient's family
 unhone kaha ki tiffin main kuch bhi nahin mila he
 When Tiwari was asked if the hospital had been evacuated and a bomb was found in the Cantt area, he said it was a rumor
 unhone janata se apil kii ki kisi bhi sandigdh vastu ko dekhne par vah police ko suchit karen or afvaahon se saavdhaan rahen
 Official sources in Delhi said that the IED appears to have been used for the blast

 There is no response to the on-screen chemistry of Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone, who were once X-lovers
 ek lambey afaire ke baad jab inke breacup kii news saamne ai to donon ke phans ko kaaphi hairaani hui thi
 The pair was first seen on screen in the 2008 hit film Bachna Ae Haseeno
 lekin breacup ke baad bhi donon kifilm 'ye javaani he divaani'ek badi hit sabit hui
 Deepika and Ranbir believe that they are very good friends
 sabhi jaanate hai ki aajkal ranbir kapur apni nijee jindagi main katrina caff ke saath relation main hai
 On the other hand, Deepika Padukone also found her partner in Bollywood star Ranveer Singh
 lekin ek intervyuu main jab deepika se poocha gaya ki kya aaj bhi wo ranbir kapur se pyaar karti hai to unhone jawaab diya, 'bilkul
 i do not think that every feeling or emotion is broken in the name of a breakup
 'deepika maanati hai ki kisi jamaane main wo ranbir kapoorke liye pajesive hua karti thim
 Deepika says, 'ranbir is someone i have always loved and i will always be positive and protective for him
 jab bhi main uske bare main padhati hum yaa uskaa kaam dekhati hum to apane man kii baaten hameshaa usase share karti hum
 Although we are two different human beings and will do what we want to do, but there is such a comfort zone in our midst that we can share anything of our mind with each other
 'ranbir kapur khud bhi maanate hai,'maine deepika ko bilkul ghar kii tarah hi pyaar kiya he
 i still care for and respect him even today, just the way and attitude of that care and response has changed a bit
 ham donon hi sakaaratmak rup se apni apni jindagiyon main aage bad gaye hai
 Soon, the two will once again be seen together in director Imtiaz Ali's film Tamasha, which is releasing on November 27
 film ke trailor launch ke samay se hi donon stars audiyans ke bich charchaa kaa vishay bane hue hai

 If this bill comes into force, it will not only make it easier to pay taxes, but will also prevent tax evasion
 iskaa lagu hona desh kii jidipi ko badhaakar arthvyavastha ko raftaar dene ke liye bhi jaruri he
 Let's know what is the GST bill? Also, what are its advantages and disadvantages due to which the screws are getting trapped
 bharat main varsh 2006-07 ke saatham bajet main pehali baar iskaa zikr kiya gaya tha
 The Goods and Services Tax has always been the subject of discussion in the disputes between the Center and the state about indirect taxes
 iske baavjood kam logon ko hi isaki puri jaankaree hogi
 And perhaps it would be known why so many questions are being raised on this
 kya he gstgudsa and sarvice tex (jiesti) ek apratyaksh kar he
 a similar tax is levied on goods and services under GST
 jahaan jiesti lagu nahin he, vahaan vastuon or sevaaon par alag-alag tex lagaae jate hai
 If the government implemented this bill from 2016, then only one tax will be levied on every goods and every service i
e
 VAT, excise and service tax will be replaced by a single tax
 kya honge iske phydekisi bhi rajya main saamaan kaa ek daamjisti lagu hone se sabase bada phayda aam aadmi ko hoga
 The same tax has to be paid to buy any goods across the country
 yani puure desh main kisi bhi saamaan kii keemat ek hi rahegi
 Just like if you buy a car in Delhi, then its price is different, while in another state, to buy the same car, different price has to be paid
 iske lagu hone se koi bhi saamaan kisi bhi rajya main ek hi rate par milegaa
 Reduction in tax dispute, if it is implemented, you will get rid of paying tax many times
 isse kar kii vasuuli karte samay karvibhaag ke adhikariyon dwaara kar main herapheri kii sambhaavna bhi kam ho jaaegi
 There will be no need to impose tax on the same person or organization multiple times, only this tax will be collected
 iske alaava jahaan kai rajyon main rajasav badhegaa to kai jagah keemton main kami bhi hogi
 The price of the goods will be reduced, with its implementation, the tax structure will be transparent, which will reduce the tax disputes to a great extent
 iske lagu hone ke baad rajyon ko milane vaala waite, manoranjan kar, lagjri tex, lottery tex, entry tex aadi bhi khatm ho jaaenge
 Currently, people have to pay 30-35 percent tax on the goods they buy while buying it, it is also likely to come down to 20-25 percent
 iske alaava bharat kii growth rate main bhi ek se dedh fisadi kii badhotaree hogi
 Companies and traders will also benefit when GST is implemented
 saamaan ek jagah se duusari jagah le jane main koi dikkat nahin hogi
 When the cost of making goods decreases, it will also make the goods cheaper
 kisko hoga nuksansti lagu hone se centre ko to phayda hoga lekin rajyon ko is baat kaa dar tha ki isse unhen nuksaan hoga kyonki iske baad ve kai tarah ke tex nahin vasule paaenge jisase unki kamai kam ho jaaegi
 Significantly, petrol and diesel run at half the budget of many states
 is baat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue centre ne rajyon ko raahat dete hue manjuuri de di he ki ve in vastuon par shuruaati saalon main tex lete rahen
 The Center will compensate for the loss of the states for five years

 The CBCID has found the theft charge against the victim girl in the Banda rape case false
 ab chori ke aarope main jail main band ladki ko jald hi reeha kiya ja saktaa he
 This information has been given by Uttar Pradesh Cabinet Secretary Shashank Shekhar
 unhone kaha ki sibisiaidi ko is maamle main ladki ke khilaaf paryaapt saboot nahin mili hai, isliye jaanch band kar di jaaegi
 Along with this, orders have been given to immediately release the girl who was raped
 banda ke vidhayak purushottam naresh dvivedi ne is ladki par chori ke aarope lagaae the, jiske baad police ne balaatkaar peedit is ladki ko jail bhej diya tha
 Earlier on Saturday, Mayawati said that she feels the allegations against the girl are false
 apane janmdin par mayawati ne kaha ki unhen lagata he ki banda ke emele ne ladki par chori kaa galat iljaam lagaaya he, saath hi ye bhi kaha ki is maamle kii sibisiaidi jaanch karai jaaegi or doshi sabit hone par emele ke khilaaf or ladki ko jail bhejne vaale police waalon ke khilaaf karrwai kii jaaegi
 Mayawati also said that the case will be heard in the fast track court
 mayawati ne kaha ki unki sarkaar satta va vipaksh main baithe kisi bhi prabhaavshaalee vyakti ko kanoon se khilwaad nahin karne degi
 As far as the Banda case is concerned, the government has taken it very seriously, which is currently under investigation by the CBCID
 unhone ummid jaahir kii ki sibisiaidi is baat kii tah main jarur jaaegi ki aaropee vidhayak or unke saathiyon ne apni ghinauni harakat chhipaane ke liye, to kahin peedit par chori kaa galat aarope to nahin lagaaya
 He said that from the statements of the girl in this case so far, it seems that there is a conspiracy of the MLA and her colleagues to hide their weakness behind the allegations of theft
 unhone jor dete hue kaha ki jaanch main yadi yah sab sachai mili to vidhayak or unke saathiyon ko balaatkaar ke saath-saath peedit par chori kaa jhootha aarope lagane kii bhi avashya kadi sajaa milegi
 In this case, warning the police that action was under suspicion from the beginning, Mayawati said that on the report of the investigation, strict action will also be taken against those policemen who have stolen the girl in a hurry without fully investigating the theft case

 In the year 2010, e-rickshaws landed on the streets of Delhi for the first time during the Commonwealth Games

 Due to its openness, e-rickshaws that attracted foreign tourists at that time have become the need of the general public in many states of the country, including Delhi today

 In the absence of policies, e-rickshaws made such places on the roads that today these problems are running in many states of the country including delhi-ncr

 Dimpy also says, "60-65 per cent of e-rickshaws operating in the country are illegal

 According to the report released by TERI in 2016, only 30 to 35 percent of e-rickshaws were registered in Delhi, whereas in some cities of Uttar Pradesh like Lucknow, Varanasi, Bareilly, only 20 to 22 percent of registered e-rickshaws

 Why e-rickshaws became illegal? In 2012-13, when e-rickshaws were strengthening their grip on the roads, they were considered as an alternative to paddle rickshaws

 lekin jab tak yah kanoon rajyon main amal main laayaa jaataa usase pehle lakhon i-rickshaw sadakon par aa chuke the
 After the enactment of the law, the government gave an opportunity to register the already running e-rickshaw but the attitude of the rickshaw drivers appeared indifferent to it

 For this, the time of six months was fixed, later the date was also extended but the owners did not get their rickshaws registered

 Contractors are running cheap illegal rickshaws by following rules
 kakkad ke mutabik, "dilli main chalane vaale zyaadaatar gaiyr kanoonee i-rickshaw thekedaaron ke hi hai
 The department's painful question is that such a large number of illegal e-rickshaws are running under the nose of the police, so why not act on them? a senior Delhi Transport Department official said, "scrap policy is not the biggest reason for e-rickshaw not being removed from the roads
 police department agar sakchati karke i-rickshaw jabt kar bhi letaa he to inhen rakhane kii koi vyavastha nahin he
 Due to no policy on scrap, they cannot be destroyed
 ''yahi kaaran hai ki dilli-ensiaar main kai jagahon par pakade gaye i-rickshon kaa ambara laga he
 Neither anyone comes to release them from the court nor can the police department release them

 Talking about Michael and Mickey (arthur), they said what they want and if you want to play for Australia then you have to accept it

 'sisodiya ne kaha, 'shiksha mantri ke taur par main aisa system banane kii chunauti sweekaar karata hum, jahaan skool yah guarantee de saken ki unke bachche bade hokar balaatkaari nahin banenge
 He said that if we cannot guarantee this, then we can send children to the forest
