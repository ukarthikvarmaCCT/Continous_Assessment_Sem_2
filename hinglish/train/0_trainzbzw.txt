 It is very common to be excited about the first date, but in the same Excitement, there are some such mistakes which have a profound effect
 kai baar inhen galatiyon ke chalate ek acha rishta banate-banate bighad jaataa he
 People make many types of preparations regarding first date
 wo chaahe ladkaa ho yaa ladki donon hi apane-apane tareeke se is din ko khaas bananaa chaahate hai
 Despite this, there is such a shortage at times, due to which the point is not made
 to kya aap nahin jaananaa chahenge wo baaten jo first date par galati se bhi nahin kerani chahie
 
 
 1
 ladakiyon ko kanphyus ladke bilkul bhi pasand nahin hote hai
 In such a situation, whenever you call a girl to meet, fix the place
 jagah aisi honi chahie jahaan do log aaraam se baithkar baat kar saken
 a very noisy place can ruin your date
 aisi jagah kaa chunaav karnaa bhi sahi nahin rahegaa jahaan sirf aap do hi hon
 The girl may not like it and may feel uncomfortable
 2
 It is wrong to be too excited or nervous during a date
 aap jaise hai, vaise hi rahen
 You will talk normal, then the person in front will also be normal
 3
 First impressions matter a lot
 aise main aapkaa luk or aapkaa approach karne kaa tarika sanjeeda or saadgibhra hona chahie
 4
 baatcheet ke dauraan turant hi dostana hone se behatar he ki dhire-dhire aage badhen
 Give the front person a lot of opportunity to speak so that you can understand him or her well
 5
 Go on a date with positive thinking
 kisi bhi cheez kaa dikhaava mat karen
 The more natural you are, the more memorable this date will be
 aapaki persenality ko nikhaarane ke liye jo cheez sabase jaruri he wo he aatmavishvaas
 Its lack not only shows you less among others, but you are not able to leave your influence anywhere
 aise main kuch aisi ladkiyaan aapke saamne aati hai jinamein kuta-kuta kar aatm vishwaas bharaa hota he or log unke kaayal ho jate hai
 Let's know these 7 things about Confident Girls
 
 
 1
 You are not dependent on anyone for shopping, dinner or watching movies, you do not need anyone to go anywhere
 yani aapke plance kisi ke hone na hone par nirbhar nahin karte kyonki aapako vakt kaatna nahin, jindagi jeena pasand he
 2
 aap apni vailu jaanati hanaap kabhi bhi dusron ko ye adhikaar nahin deteen ki koi aapako jaj kare
 You know both your strengths and weaknesses
 inamen sudhaar kii aap lagaataar koshish karti rahati hai
 3
 aapako safai dena pasand nahinhar baat ko explene karne main aapaki koi dilchaspee nahin hoti kyonki aapako nasafai dena pasand hota haior na lenaa
 4
 aap atension ke peeche nahin bhaagtinapako apni kaabiliyat par itnaa bharosa hota he ki aapako iske liye kisi or ke certificate kii jarurat nahin hoti
 To make you feel good about yourself, you do not depend on anyone for this
 5
 You like to take your own decisions
 You do not want to take any decision in your life in the pressure of another
 bhale hi aap sunati sabaki baaten hai lekin karti apane man kaa hi hai
 6
 kisi negative baaten nahin dhotiapaka apana samay kahaan lagaana he, kahaan nahin
 Which person has to give attention, who does not
 in sab kaa faisla aap khud leti hai or kisi ko bhi apni life negativity nahin bharne detii hai
 7
 apni parvaah aap khud karnaa chaahati hamparvaah karne vaale log aapako bhi pasand hai
 But you do not like it all the time, someone cares about you

 To tell what our people have done to achieve this day
 ' On Republic Day, when the security cordon around the Red Fort was the most guarded, a 72-year-old elderly woman living alone at home in the Shalimar Bagh area of the capital, a few kilometers away, was not safe inside her home
 kisi ne unki galaa ret kar hatya kar di
 The entire incident has been captured in CCTV
 police ke mutabik, ghar main plumber kaa kaam karne aae vyakti par bujurg mahila kii hatya kaa shaq he
 At present, the police have started investigating the body
 jile kii disipi bhi maukey par pahunchin or vaardaat kaa gauge liya
 Police said the elderly woman had two sons, although she lived alone in the house
 mritka ke pati kii kuch saal pehle maut ho chuki he or donon beton or ek beti kii shaadi ho chuki he
 Both sons live separately with their families
 shuukravaar ko chuttee hone ke kaaran mritka kaa pota unase milane aayaa tha
 But the main gate of the house was locked from inside and when the door did not open for long, his senses flew as soon as he entered through the back door
 ghar ke andar mahila khun se lathpath padi thi or sara saamaan bikharaa hua tha
 Also, jewelry and cash kept in the cupboard were also missing
 mritka ke bete ne police ko soochna di
 The locals have also suspected the plumber of murder and robbery on the plumber who came to repair the motor
 aas pados ke logon kaa kahana he ki ek vyakti lagaataar kuch din se aa rahaa tha or ghatana vaale din shaam ko bhi vah aayaa tha or upar pani kii tank thik karne bhi gaya tha
 When the police searched the CCTV camera footage in the street on the back side of the house, pictures of a suspect were shown in it
 padosi chashmadidane bhi footage dekh tasdik kii he ki footage main dikh rahaa shaks hi mritka ke ghar aayaa tha
 The woman has two sons, Rajesh and Sanjay, who live with their families at some distance
 sutron ke anusaar bade bete ne yah mana he ki unhone apane ek jaankaar plumber ko pani kaa motor thik karne ke liye bheja tha
 i don't remember when i first felt that as a woman i would be prevented from doing everything i wanted to do
 haa lekin main ek aise samaaj main rahati hum jahaan zyaadaatar mahilaon ko doum darje kaa naagarik mana jaataa he
 Where they are nothing more than a baggage, where they are humiliated and tortured every day
 is swatantraaa diwas par maine khud ko yaad dilaayaa ki aazaadee uphaar kii tarah muft main nahin milti
 One has to fight to get it
 badakismati se pakistan kii zyaadaatar mahilaon ke liye aage kii raah kathinaaiyon se bhari he
 They are suffering from fundamentalism
 izzat kii khatir unki hatya kar di jaati he, quran se nikaah kar dena, vatta satta, tejaab se hamalaa or gharelu hinsa kii ve shikaar hai
 Not only this, Kisas and Diyat law (eye law instead of eye) are also used against them
 police or nyaayadhish aam taur par gharelu hinsa ke maamalon ko yaa to anupyukt bataa dete hai yaa phir ise nijee yaa paariwarik maamla maanate hai
 They consider the issue as a civil court case and not a criminal court
 pakistan ke maanavadhikaar ayog ke ek adhyayan main pataa chalaa ki yahaan ke lagbhag 80 fisadi pariwaron main gharelu hinsa hoti he
 i know the courageous women of Pakistan, who move ahead, leaving behind the fear
 ve parde ke peeche kii hero hai, drudh-nishchayi hai, roodhiyon or bediyon se loha leti hai taaki apni pahchaan bana saken
 They do twice as much work than men but still do not get even half the importance of it
 phir bhi in mahilaon ne haar nahin maani
 Today Pakistani women are reaching big positions
 ve vakil hai, chikitsak hai, payalat, lekhak, sangeetkaar, banker, udhyami, raajnneetijna, diziner, shikshak, kalakaar, abhinayta, athlete hai
 Pakistan is the first Muslim country whose Prime Minister has been a woman
 pakistani sansad kii adhyaksh mahila he, videsh mantri mahila, soochna mantri or america main pakistan kii rajdoot bhi mahila hai
 The caretaker defense minister is also a woman
 hamaare yahaan major general ek mahila hai, auskar puraskaar vijeta mahila bhi hai
 Around 22 per cent of women are in the lower house of parliament and about 16 per cent in the upper house, a figure even higher than India, America or Britain
 sarkari vishvavidhyalayon main mahilaon kii sankhya purushon ke mukaable zyada he
 He has an important role in agricultural production and cottage industries

 The Punjab Government led by Pakistan Muslim League (N) in April this year brought the Punjab Women Empowerment Package

 kaamkaaj kii jagahon par shoshan, tejabi hamale, izzat kii khatir hatya, jabaran nikaah jaise aparaadhon se mahilaon kii suraksha ke liye asif ali jaradaari ke netritv vaali sangheey sarkaar dheron nae kanoon laai he
 Last month, a campaign of "one million signatures" was launched against the excesses of women in which Zardari had signed the last, besides announcing that the government will now appoint women judges
 mahilaon ke saath hinsa kisi kshetra, samskruti yaa sirf pakistan tak simit nahin he
 The number of such crimes is very high in many developing countries
 pakistan bhi inase jujhna sikh jayega
 i am more concerned about the dark aspects of religious fundamentalism and its impact on women
 haalanki swat main sab kuch teji se saamaanya ho rahaa he lekin khaybar, pakhtoonkhwaa or phata main ladakiyon ke skulon par baar-baar golibari, bambaari hoti he
 The Taliban has destroyed 1,200 such schools in Pakistan over the past decade
 aatankwaadi or dharmik kattarpathiyon ne mahilaon ke jivan ko itnaa kathin bana diya he ki ab ve har baat ke liye unki mohataaj ban gai hai
 They cannot step outside the home without a male member of the family, they are not allowed to work, are prohibited from listening to music or using cosmetics
 kai misaalen hai, jis mahila ne inamen se koi niyam todaa, use saarvajanik rup se isaki sajaa di gai
 This fundamentalism has also taken the cities into a grip
 pichley saal agast main ek police vaala nairang art gailaree main dhaddhadata hua ghusaa or usne ek mahila curator ko isliye peetna shuru kar diya kyonki mahila ne bina baaju vaale kapade pahane the
 It should have been that we would have raised our voice for this woman or in favor of women like Aasia Bibi or Fakhra Yunus
 lekin isaki bajaae, ''izzat'' or ''gairat'' ke prati apane junun kii khatir, jise hamaare dharmik adhikaron or badnaam agenciyon ne or badhaava diya, janata aatankwaadi aafiya siddiki or ume hasan kii himachati ban gai
 It is necessary to have a framework for monitoring rights
 haalanki abhi to yah mahaj shuruyaat he
 The truth is that the whole society will have to bring about remarkable changes in itself
 sarkari or nijee kshetra main mahilaon ko khule man se sweekaar karnaa hoga
 But for this women have to learn fast and men have to be ready to forget all that had happened so far so that gender discrimination can be removed
 is ullekhneey badlaav kaa sabase ahm hissaa he talim
 Empowerment truly means the right to choose from one's choice
 shiksha aisa karne kaa mauka hamen detii he
 In bringing gender equality, making society safe and equitable, raising income, reducing maternal and child mortality, training will be important for health, happiness and the betterment of the whole society
 aazaadee ke baad se pakistan kii shiksha dar main sudhaar jarur hua he
 But even today, there are only the least educated Pakistani women in the world
 pakistan sahit sabhi samaajon main ladakiyon ko shikshit karnaa sabase pehali praathamikta honi chahie
 The road ahead is very long and very difficult
 ham chaar kadam aage badhaate hai to do kadam peeche lene ko majaboor ho jate hai
 But i have full faith in the unity of women, but also in the power of every woman
 ve halaat badal sakati hai or bediyon kii deevaaron ko todane kaa madda rakhti hai

 (with input from news agency PTI) pakistan ke peeche china khadaa he or bharat ke liye agar ye sabase mushkil sabab he to pakistan ke liye sabase badi takat he, kyonki international court of justise ke faisle ko jis tarah pakistan ne bina der kiye khaarij kiya usne nayaa sawaal to ye khadaa kar hi diya he ki kya isaje ke faisle ko naa maan kar pakistan yuan main janaa chahta he
 Pakistan will join the Chinese veto in the UN, just as China saved on the veto over Jaish chief Masood Azhar
 jaahir he china ke liye pakistan maujuuda vakt main stretagic partner ke taur par sabase jaruri he or bharat china ke liye chunauti he or dhyaan den to kashmir main aatankwaad se lekar iconomic corndor tak main jo bhoomika china pakistan ke saath khadaa hokar nibhaa rahaa he, usamen jadhav maamle main bhi china pakistan ke saath khadaa hoga, inkaar isse bhi nahin kiya ja saktaa
 But supporting Pakistan in the Jadhav case may also put China in the dock, as currently the Chinese Court of Justice Jiu Hanquan is also in the queue of 15 judges of the International Court of Justice, and Ronnie Abraham unanimously gave the verdict twice
 Referring to the judgment
 ek taraf china ke jaj agar faisle ke saath he to phir maamla chaahe yuan main chalaa jaae
 How can China veto there for Pakistan
 lekin ye tabhi sambhav he ki jab china bhi jadhav maamle par isaje ke faisle ko sirf kanoonee faisla maane
 However the truth is the opposite
 court kaa faisla bharat pakistan ke sambandhon ke maddenjar sirf kanoon tak simit nahin he or china kaa pakistan ke saath khadey hona yaa bharat ke khilaaf janaa kanoonee samaj bhar nahin he, balkirajanyik or raajnneetise aage new world order ko hi china jis tarah apane haq main khadaa karnaa chaah rahaa he usamen bharat ke liye sawaal pakistan nahin balki china he, jisase takraaye bagaiyr pakistan ke taale kii chaabi bhi nahin khulegi ye bhi sach he

 Therefore, the market for e-book and published book is different and there is no contradiction

 Anant Vijay is a great lyric of our times
 ek stanbhakaar, aalochak, lekhak, vaktaa ke rup main unhone apana vyapak prabhaav choda he
 They read a lot, and they write as much
 bataur lekhak jahaan vah apane vishay ko lekar bahut spasht hai, vahiin bataur aalochak unhone bade bade lekhakon kii bakhiya udhedi he
 In recent times, he has also been in great discussion about his right wing attachment, although he neither accepts nor rejects it
 bahut saare vishaya par unki soch behad spasht hai
 Probably the reason for this is his education, which was once praised even by Rajendra Yadav and Namwar Singh
 anant vijay ise sweekaaren yaa nahin, par unhen gandhi se bhi utana hi lagaav he, jitna sangh or uski vichaardhaara se
 He also says that the Congress has not adopted the policies of Gandhiji as much as the Sangh did, but the Congress has not
 vichaaron kii isi spashtataa ko lekar kai baar vah aalochana kaa bhi shikaar hue
 Once in Rajasthan, he had said that the extent of individual worship in our society is such that we do not leave any stone unturned to glorify the heroes of the losers
 murtiyon lagaate hai, unke naam se pul banaate hai
 It was then believed that his reference was towards Maharana Pratap
 khub aalochana hui par vah peeche nahin hate
 He is a known face of literature festivals because of his tendency to write - and to stick to his writing, to speak - and not to spare anyone in his statements
 haalanki isse anant ne jis teji se mitra banaae, utani hi teji main virdohi
 But one of the things that remained unquestionably with him in all this is his involvement with literature and his initiative towards its promotion
 vah jis akhbaar se jude hai usamen niyamit kollam likhte hai, or sahitya ko mukhyadhara main laane ke liye kai tarah kii yojanaon se jude hai
 Author of books like 'contextually', 'babel in the quarrel', 'configuration of genres', 'bollywood selfie' and 'criterion of democracy'; 'mere Patra', 'kahani', 'poetry in Babel', '21 Stories of the 21st Century'; Anant's Vani Prakashan, the editor of and translator of 'biwi Fatima and the son of the Emperor', has brought out a new critical book called 'ardh Satya Satya of Marxism'
 is kitaab ke parichay ke rup main flap par likhaa he, "anant vijay kii pustak kaa sheershak ‘marxvad kaa ardhsaty' ek baar pathak ko chaunkaayegaa
 For a moment, it will force him to think, whether this book is an attempt to explain Marxist criticism or any interpretation of Marxist principles or any reinterpretation of it
 magar pustak main jaise-jaise pathak pravesh karata jaayegaa uskaa bhram dur hota chalaa jaayegaa
 By the end, this confusion will be transformed into the belief that in the guise of Marxism these days, due to the clashes of mutual interest and selfishness, one becomes above thoughts
 kaise vyaktivaadee antardvandvon or duchitepan ke kaaran ek marxvaadi kaa aacharan badal jaataa he
 "the Hindi belt has been disillusioned with Marxism in the last nearly decade and Marxists have been exposed due to personal clashes, Anant Vijay has meticulously analyzed the factors that have brought Marxists to the crossroads where it It has become difficult to decide whether ideology is big or individual
 vyaktvaad ke bahaane anant vijay ne marxvad ke upar jam gayi us gard ko hataane or use samajhane kaa prayaas kiya he
 The 'semi-truth of Marxism' actually brings out the individualist frustration and ideological arrogance, which reinforces the feudal, casteist and bourgeois mentality under the guise of commitment
 aaj marxvad ko uske anuyaayiyon ne jis tarah se vaicharik labaade main chatapataane ko majaboor kar diya he, yah pustak usee nirmam satya ko saamne laati he
 In a way, this book is the Marcia of this semi-state
 pustak anshah marxvad kaa ardhsaty* anant vijayfidel castro ke chehre se bhi krantikari nayak kaa nakaab lagaataar utarataa rahaa he jisapar charchaa nahin hui
 Fidel Castro not only married and married a married woman but also became the father of a child
 natalia naam kii is mahila or castro ke bich ke prem patron ke saarvajanik hone ke baad is vivaahettar sambandh kaa khulaasa hua
 When Natalia died, she was convinced that the person who made the invasion strategy in 1953, staying at her home, forgets Cuba when she is in power two years later
 bhul to wo apni beti ko bhi jaataa he
 This is the worst form of Marxism's concept of a glass of water
 ab usase bhi ek khatarnaak baat saamne ai he
 The book, The Double Life of Fidel Castro, by Juan Rinaldo Sanchez, the bodyguard of Cuban President Fidel Castro, for seventeen years, revealed how Castro used a drugs trader to siege Cuba in return for seventy-five thousand dollars Gave permission
 is kitaab main is baat ke paryaapt saboot die gaye hai ki kis tarah se fidel castro apane sikret room main baithkar cocaine kaarobaari ke bare main saudebaaji kar rahe the
 The author of this book also revealed that Castro has twenty luxurious rooms in Havana, he also owns a Caribbean island
 is tarah ke khulaason se saaf he ki marxvad kii aad main unke rahanuma rahasyamayi sexual life se lekar tamaam tarah ke bhautikwaadi pravritiyon ko apanaate hai or vichaardhaara kii aad main vyavastha badalane kaa sapana dikhaakar apana ullu sidhaa karte hai
 Regarding the Communist Party of Germany, Lenin said that the leftists there do not consider themselves leftists and call themselves the opposition on theoretical grounds
 lenin ne us vakt germany ke vamapanthiyon kii us pravriti ko inphantile disorder of leftism kaha tha
 Seeing the danger of freedom of expression, the way the two dozen writers returned the Sahitya Akademi Award, it can be said that by borrowing Lenin's words, these authors of the return of the prize were also victims of infantile disorder
 yahaan bhi kamobesh sabhi lekhakon ne khud ko siddhant kaa virodh paksh qaraar diya he
 Now if we examine the theoretical aspect of the opposition, then it clearly emerges that they have been changing their sides according to the country, time and situation
 aaj jin logon ko abhivyakti kii aazaadee par khatra najar aa rahaa he unamem se zyaadaatar log immergency ke daur main likh rahe the
 It is beyond debate that the biggest danger of expression in India was that it was a period of emergency
 us vakt to hamaare moulik adhikaron par bhi paharaa laga diya gaya tha
 Now remember the leftists at that time what was their stand
 dilli main upanyaaskaar bhishma saahani kii adhyakshata main hui pragatisheel lekhak sangh kii baithak main immergency kaa samarthan kiya gaya tha or usko anushaasan parv qaraar diya tha
 At that time no conscience of any writer was awakened and no one had taken the step of returning the award
 kyonki us vakt in sansthaaon par vamapanthiyon kaa kabja tha
 This was the same period when Indira Gandhi handed over the vassals of literary institutions to the Left in return for the support of the Emergency
 ab agar ham churaasi ke sikh virdohi dangon ke baad kii baat naa bhi uthaaen, ham do hajaar do ke gujarat dangon ke dauraan lekhakon kii puraskaar vaapasi ke babat sawaal naa bhi puuchhen lekin mujffarnagar dangon kii baat to uthaani chahie
 The killing of Ikhlaq near Dadri has also been made a point by those returning the award
 dadri se chand kilometre dur mujffarnagar ke dangon main basth logon kii hatya kii gai
 After that Akhilesh Sarkar announced his annual Sahityak Puraskar
 gaaje baaje ke saath hindi ke lekhakon ne jaakar upi ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke kar kamalon se chaar lakh se lekar chalis hajaar tak ke darjanon puraskaar liye
 Then nobody remembered anything
 yaad to tab bhi nahin aayaa tha jab commered pansre kii hatya kii gai thi yaa sahi myanon main buddhivaadee dabholkar sahab kaa katl kiya gaya
 Neither did anyone question the Sahitya Akademi nor was he tempted to take a stand from Sahitya Akademi
 kyonki us vakt kii sarkaron se pratyaksh rup se vichaardhaara ko or paroksh rup se swaarth ko koi khatra nahin tha
 Let's take a look at the award-winning writers
 udai prakaash to yogi adityanath se puraskaar lekar is yogya nahin rah gaye hai ki unpar charchaa kii jaae yaa unako gambhirtha se liya jaae
 We will talk about Ashok Vajpayee and Krishna Sobti
 haalanki aapako yaad dilaate chalem ki udai prakaash, ashok vaajapeyi ko power brokar maanate rahe hai or daawa karte hai ki unako hindi main koi gambhirtha se nahin letaa lekin yah bhi dilachasp he ki udai prakaash ko jis juri ne sahitya academy puraskaar diya uske ashok vaajapeyi sadsy the
 Actually the credibility of these literary awards is over
 ek udhaaharan dekhie ki jab sitakant mahapaatr samskruti mantralay ke sachiv the to unako gyanpith puraskaar miltaa he or usee mantralay main sanyukt sachiv ashok vaajapeyi ko sahitya academy kaa puraskaar miltaa he
 Is there merit or talent behind it or something else
 iske alaava ashok vaajapeyi ko dayavati modi puraskaar mila tha tab usko lekar uthe vivaad ko dohraane kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 To understand how sensitive Ashok Vajpayee is, one should recall his statement during the Kavi Sammelan held after the Bhopal gas tragedy
 tab ashok vaajapeyi ne kaha tha ki marane vaale ke saath mara nahin jaataa he
 After such statements, when the same person now expects sensitivity, it does not have the expected effect
 kahana naa hoga ki ashok vaajapeyi ke bayanon or puraskaar lautaane kaa bhi utana asar nahin padaa
 In fact, the credibility of Literary Awards has gone down in the last several years
 iske liye koun jimmedaar hai, usapar lekhak samudaay ko vichaar karnaa chahie, desh kii bahultavaadi samskruti par khatre ke baad krishna sobati ne bhi sahitya academy puraskaar lautaane kaa elaan kiya, ek jamaane main krishna ji ne puraskaron ko lekar kaha tha ki chand sahityak logon ko hi dilli ke india international centre ke baar main jane kii sahuuliyat he jahaan par sahitya ke kai masale tay hote hai, ab agar sahityak puraskaar iaisi kii baar main tay hote hai to usko lautaa hi diya janaa chahie, darasal is virodh ke peeche kii manshaa ko bhi samajhane kii jarurat he
 The central government has banned foreign donations of many ngos, including the Ford Foundation
 is baat kii bhi padtaal honi chahie ki sarkaar ke is kadam ke baad sahityakaron ke virodh ne jor kyon pakadaa

 haal hi main sonam se jab ek event main kangana dwaara lagaae gaye aaropon ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone sabase pehle is ghatana ko dukhad bataaya
 After this he also said, "it is not right to trust Kangana every time
 "kangana ne jawaab main kya kaha?sonam kii ye baat kangana ko buree lagi or aanan fanan main kangana ne bhi ek statement jari kar diya
 In which she writes, "who gives Sonam the right to judge me? sonam ke paas kya is baat kaa license he ki unhen kis mahila par bharosa karnaa he or kis par nahi
 How can she question my allegations? maine apane desh ko kai antarrashtriya manch par pregent kiya he

 "kangana ne apane statement main keval sonam hi nahin balki unke parivaar tak ko ghasita he
 After this statement given by Kangana, now it is really interesting to see what Sonam Kapoor answers
 puraa maamla kya he, kaise shuru hua vivadabta den ki ye maamla saal 2015 main bani phantum kii film "bombai velvet" ke pramotional tour ke dauraan kaa he
 a woman in the film's crew interviewed "huffington Post" accusing Vikas of molesting Vikas
 mahila kaa kahana tha ki usne is baat kii shikaayat phantum films ke anuraag kashyap se bhi kii thi
 But no action was taken on the entire incident
 haalanki maamla saamne aane ke baad anuraag ne apni galati ke liye maafee maang lee

 Vikas was still married while we were shooting for the film Queen, but he used to mention having a physical relationship with a new partner daily
 vikaas har raat party karte the or mujhe in partiyon main shaamil naa hone ke liye sharminda karte the
 Whenever Vikas met anywhere, he would hug me strangely, sniff my hair and say that he loves this fragrance
 "kangana ne kaha tha, "mujhe unki harkaton se lagata tha ki unke saath kuch to gadabad he

 com / rpmpqcde4t Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday asked his Pakistani counterpart Yusuf Raza Gilani to rein in the mastermind of the terrorist attacks on Mumbai and Hafiz Saeed, the head of Jamaat-ud Dawa
 singh ne kaha ki said ko aaazaad ghoomane dena kshetra main shanti or sthirataa ke liye acha sanket nahin he
 Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao told reporters that Prime Minister Singh expressed concern about Hafiz Saeed and about allowing him to roam free and the concession in the dialogue and said that this was not fair (for india-pakistan relations)
 donon pradhanmantriyon ke bich baatcheet ke baad nirupama ne kaha ki pradhanmantri singh ne pakistan se joardaar shabdon main kaha ki use aatankwaad ke maamle or apane desh se aatanki tatwon ko apni dharti se samaapt karne ke liye karrwai karne kii jarurat he
 Gilani assured Singh that his government was taking all possible measures to bring the perpetrators of the terrorist attack on Mumbai to justice and not allow Pakistani soil to be used for terrorism against India
 beete saptaah pakistan ke aantarik maamalon ke mantri rahamaan malik ne kaha tha ki adhikari said or jeyudi par nigaah rakhe hue hai
 Malik refused to take action against the founder of lashkar-e-taiba without a concrete case
 bank ne iske alaava phixd rate par home lone bhi sasta kar diya he
 By the way, let us tell here that earlier SBI and HDFC have also made home loans cheaper
 aapako dhyaan hoga ki kuch roj pehle arabiai governor ne bainkon se kaha tha ki ve lone kii daren ghataaen
 ICICI Bank reduced its home loan rates by 25 basis points to 9 for its existing and new customers

 ' saal 2018 kii shuruyaat doklam vivaad ke saaye main hui
 This year, while border areas were infiltrated by China several times, India developed basic and security related infrastructure in areas close to the Chinese border
 lekin pakistan se satee seemaa se aatankiyon kii ghuspaith main kami nahin ai he
 This year there was a stir on the Indian border along China and Pakistan
 donon deshon kii ore se bharat kii seemaa main kai baar ghuspaith kii gai
 China did not learn from Doklam
 In June last year, the Chinese army was trying to build a road in Doklam area of bhutan, but the Bhutanese government opposed it
 doklam bharat ke liye samrik rup se ahm chiken nek ke najadik he
 Therefore, the Indian Army opposed China's efforts
 isse china tilamila uthaa
 The armies of both the countries remained face to face in this area for about 73 days
 baad main donon deshon ke bich kootnithik baatcheet hui or donon senaayen peeche hatin
 The incident caused a bit of bitterness between the two countries
 is saal april main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne china kaa daura kiya
 During this time he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping
 piem modi ke is daure ke baad donon deshon ke rishton main thodi garmaahat ai
 India started collecting military equipment at many places near the 3,500-km-long border with China at the beginning of this year after the 31-airport airport blockade
 yahi nahin, bharat ne bade paimaane par sadak samet buniyadi dhaanche kaa vikaas shuru kar diya he
 According to information given in Parliament, India is constructing 73 roads near the China border
 inamen se 30 project puure ho chuke hai
 India's readiness to deal with China's potential threat can be gauged from the fact that 31 airfields have been developed near the western and eastern side of China's border
 inamen assam ke chabua or tejpur ke airport sabase ahm hai
 Not only this, India has also built two advance landing grounds (algs) at Tawang and Dirang in Arunachal
 iske alaava purvottar kshetra main pehle se bane hue 6 eelji ko apgrade bhi kar rahaa he
 The longest rail-road bridge in Dibrugarh, Assam, on December 25 by PM Narendra Modi 4

 One can travel on this bridge by train and bus
 brij ke nichle bhaag main 2 rail trek bichhaae gaye hai
 While a 3 lane road is built above
 is pul kii madad se assam or arunachal pradesh kii duuri kam ho jaaegi
 This bridge connects Dibrugarh in Assam to Dhemaji district across the Brahmaputra
 iske najadik hi arunachal pradesh kaa silapathar bhi he
 This bridge is considered very important from a strategic perspective
 is pul par army ke baari tanks bhi le jaaya ja sakenge
 Tawang rail project will increase China's headache The Government of India will build a rail network in Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh at an altitude of about 10,000 feet near the border of China
 iskaa nirmaan 6-7 saal main puraa hone kii sambhaavna he
 Significantly, China has been claiming that this region belongs to Arunachal Pradesh
 bharat kaa iskaa virodh karata he
 India has the edge: The authorities believe that even though China is preparing on a large scale, India has a natural edge over China
 jaankaron ke mutabik china ke hawaii kshetra oonchai par hai, jahaan sainya saaj-o-saamaan or eendhan ko kam maatra main hi le jaaya ja saktaa he
 China has built 15 airports
 It is true that China has done a lot of work on its infrastructure near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the last few years
 yahi vajah he ki padosi desh seemaa par 15 pramukh hawaii adde or 27 choti hawaii pattiyaan bana chukaa he
 Among these is the Gokar Airport in Tibet used in all types of weather, where advanced fighter planes are deployed
 yahi nahin, bataaya ja rahaa he ki china ne tibet or unnan praant main vyapak sadak or rail network taiyaar kar liya he
 This means that the Chinese army can now reach the border with India in just 48 hours
 bataaya jaataa he ki china ne vaastavik niyantran rekha ke paas kareeb 31 jagahon par pakki sadaken bana lee hai
 Chinese infiltration several times: In 2018, Chinese soldiers infiltrated several areas of India several times
 chini sainikon ne ladakh ke kuch sector main july main kai baar ghuspaith kii thi
 Not only this, Chinese troops infiltrated the Barahoti area of uttarakhand as well
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki 20 july ko chini sainikon kii ek tukdi uttari ladakh ke depasang plane main bhartiya seemaa ke andar kareeb 19 kimi tak ghus ai thi
 The Chinese troops returned after a tough stand by ITBP jawans
 lekin 21 july ko ek baar phir chini sena ne vahi harakat kii or bhartiya seemaa ke depasang ke ilaake main kareeb 18 kilometre andar tak ghuspaith kii
 On 28 July and 31 July, Chinese troops infiltrated 17–18 km inside the Depsang Plain in northern Ladakh
 ladakh ke hi trig hit or tract jankshan main bhi chini sainikon ne 21, 28 or 29 july ko 1 kilometre se lekar 5 kilometre andar tak ghuspaith kii thi
 Not only this, Chinese soldiers had infiltrated near Pangong Lake
 dragon ne agast main bhi ghuspaith kii koshishen jari rakhin
 There were 14 infiltrations in different sectors of Ladakh in two weeks
 chini sainikon ke pengong so lake ke ilaake main bhi agast ke maheene main 5 baar ghuspaith kii thi
 In September, two helicopters of the People's Liberation Army of China in the Trig Heights area of ladakh flew into Indian territory for 10 minutes and then returned
 china ke napak mansoobey yaheen nahin thame
 In October, crossing the LAC in Arunachal Pradesh, they entered the Indian border
 lekin bhartiya sainikon ke virodh ke baad unhen lautnaa padaa
 Water also stopped! China in October this year, China also stopped the water of Brahmaputra river flowing through Tibet
 isse arunachal pradesh main sookhe kaa khatra paidaa ho gaya tha
 This year infiltration along the border with PAK continued, Pakistan also did not desist from its antics
 jammu-kashmir main seemaa paar se ghuspaith jari rahi
 However, due to the aggressive attitude of Indian security forces, more than two hundred and fifty terrorists were killed in the Valley this year

 In whose court every wish is fulfilled
 jiske darbar main sheesh nawane bhar se siddhi or samruddhi milti he
 That court is in the Siddhivinayak Ganapati temple, which is the first worshiper of Lord Shree Ganesha
 mumbai ke prabhadevi kshetra main kadam rakhte hi dur se hi siddhivinayak mandir kaa kalash najar aane lagata he or uske saath dikhaai dene lagata he wo pavitra dhvaj jo kisi prahari kii tarah apni ore aane vaale har shraddhalu kii agavaani karata he

 is divya mandir ke bare manyata he ki is mandir main siddhivinayak swayan prakat hue the
 Time passed and along with this, the devotion for Lord Siddhivinayak grew in the mind of every devotee which is still intact, that is why the greatest heroes come here on foot barefoot with their family and prosperity
 If wished, millions of devotees apply their requests here, wishing for freedom from the ups and downs of life

 Before the general elections in Pakistan, the former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has been given a strong blow by the Ehtisab (accountability) Court

 landan main flats vivaad par sajaalandan main posh evenfield house main chaar flaton ke swaamitv se jude evenfield bhrashtachar maamle main 5 baar sthagit karne ke baad court ne apana faisla sunaaya
 Earlier, the Sharif family had appealed to the accountability court to postpone the hearing on Nawaz Sharif and his family on the graft cases, but the court flatly rejected the appeal and pronounced its verdict
 sharif par baari jurmaankadalat ke 100 panne ke faisle main sharif par ek karod dollars kaa baari jurmaana bhi lagaaya gaya he jabaki unki beti mariyam par 26 lakh dollars kaa jurmaana lagaaya gaya he

 The court did not accept the appeal

 team india ke liye number-4 par ballebaaji main lagaataar asthirataa rahi he
 There have been changes in this sequence
 2015 ke world cap ke baad se bharat ne chauthe number par 11 ballebaaj utaare the
 The number of players to bat at number four has increased to 13 after the 2019 World Cup
 lekin talash abhi tak puri nahin hui he
 In odis, no team has so many batsmen at number-4
 maujuuda world champion england kii baat karen to usne 2015 ke world cap ke baad se is ballebaaji kram par sirf 4 ballebaaj hi utaare hai

 It remains to be seen whether India's search for number four ends

 Captain Virat Kohli himself also failed to perform well at number 4

 But it seems, due to a clause in Nepal's judicial system, that he may get out of jail for the last time
 aath saal pehle use ek america paryatak, koni jo bron
 Zich was convicted of murder
 yah akeli hatya he jiske liye use sajaa di gai, haalanki uski jeevani (da life and krimes of charles shobhraj) likhane vaale richard nevil or juli clark ke saamne vah kabool kar chukaa he ki usne chaar deshon main kam se kam 10 hatya kii hai
 But Sobhraj will have to wait four years to come out of jail
 nepali kanoon ke mutabik, jab doshi 70 varsh kii umr main pahunch jaataa he, uski sajaa aadhi kar di jaati he
 66-year-old Sobhraj, sentenced to 20 years imprisonment, has served a seven-year sentence
 ek sevanivrutt police inspector or shobhraj ke khilaaf daleel dene vaale ek vakil vishwa laal shreshth ne bataaya, ''duusare shabdon main, jab shobhraj 70 saal kaa hoga, use central jail se mukti mil jaaegi
 "this will satisfy many convicts, but Sobhraj wants to come out of jail with a clean chit
" haal hi main usne india today se bad-badhkar kaha, ''mujhe hatya ke ek bhi maamle main doshi nahin tehraaya ja sakaa he
 "in February this year, he sought compensation of 700,000 euros from the Government of Nepal for being put in jail" without any proof "wrongly accused"
 nepal ke supreme court ne uski punarikshan yachika khaarij kar di to usne geneva main sanyukt raashtra maanavadhikaar cameti (echarasi) ko bheji yachika main daawa kiya ki us par galat mukadmaa chalaaya gaya
 He claimed that a case was made against him on the basis of media reports in the charges of murder outside Nepal
 shobhraj ke mutabik, vartmaan maamle main ek bhi gavaah nahin tha yaa yah sabit karne ke liye koi saboot nahin tha ki vah 1975 main nepal main tha
 The present case was prepared on the basis of circumstantial evidence
 echarasi ke kathmando karyaalay ne kaha ki usne shobhraj ko 'bari' nahin kiya he, lekin usne uske mukademe or use hiraasat main rakhane kii sthiti ke bare main 'vishisht chintaa' vyakt kii thi
 She is also called a 'bikini killer' because her alleged victims were hippie girls
 jab unke shav andaman ke samudr se nikaale gaye, ve apane swim suut main thim
 He is also called a 'snake' because he escaped from the jails of Asia many times
 1975 main nepal main hui ek hatya ke aarope main shobhraj ko 2003 main kathmando ke ek casino se giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 In his defense, he said that he never came to Nepal before 2003
 nepali police ne adaalat ko bataaya ki usne netherland kaa naagarik banakar henricas bintanja ke naam se yatra kii thi
 Vishwa Lal Shrestha, who investigated the case at the time, remembers that he questioned Sobhraj as Bintanja
 shreshth kaa kahana he, ''poochtacha karne ke ek din baad vah yah bahaanaa karke dobaaraa aayaa ki uskaa gold parker pen chhot gaya tha
 We tried to find him
 baad main hamen ehsaas hua ki vah sirf yah pataa karne aayaa tha ki hamen us par andeh tha yaa nahin
 "finally they have kept him imprisoned, the Nepalese government is taking full care not to run away
" shobhraj ko jail ke atyadhik suraksha vaale lowep 'golghar' main rakhaa gaya he, jo jail ke andar hi ek alag kothri he
 It has six chambers for notorious criminals
 in kothriyon main uske saathiyon main ek adhyaaapak virendra pradhan he jisane ek kishor chaatr kii hatya kar di thi
 Till recently, the local media businessman Yusuf Ansari was also in this jail
 do maheene pehle shobhraj se milane aae ek vyakti ne ansaari kii hatya karne kii koshish kii thi
 Sobhraj claimed that he did not know the Punjab attacker, Jagjit Singh, but jail officials said that he had met Sobhraj 21 times in the last few months
 vah jail kii librari main ja saktaa he, uske liye ek televijan set he or angan main vah marshall art kaa abhyaas karata he
 According to a Central Jail official, his main complaint is that he is not allowed to go out
 jail adhikari kaa kahana he, ''ab use adaalat main hajir nahin hona he kyonki supreme court uske maamle par punarvichaar karne se inkaar kar chukaa he
 Even when he falls ill, he is not taken to the hospital and the doctor comes to see him
 '' shobhraj ne is saal janvari main daant dard kii shikaayat kii
 He had four bad teeth fixed
 daanton ke doctor ne uskaa ilaaj kothri main kiya
 The authorities paid Rs 60,000 for treatment of her teeth
 kharch kiye
 Although people may come to meet him twice a week, the jail authorities keep an eye on him
 kadi nigaraanee ke baavjood, do saal pehle vah jail main chorichhipe vivaah samaaroh yojit karne main safal rahaa
 She got married to the beautiful Nepali interpreter Nihita Biswas
 vah sirf 22 saal kii thi
 Nihita's mother Shakuntala Thapa is now Sobhraj's lawyer
 thapa kaa kahana he, ''ek din meri beti ne mujhe aakar kaha, mama main ek videshi se vivaah karne ja rahi hum
 i asked him what Charles? My daughter is very stubborn, i knew that i would refuse, i would become evil
 yahi niyati he
 "it was not easy for the Biswas family
 thapa aah bharte hue kahati hai, ''charles se pehle uskaa koi bwoyfriend tak nahin tha
 Some people say that the rest of the girls go to drink coffee with the boys but our Nihita went directly to the Central Jail
 use prem ho gaya tha
 Thapa's husband was a resident of Kolkata
 jab nihitha 15 saal kii thi tab usne parivaar ko chhod diya tha
 "all our relatives were against it, but Nanu (nihita) said that all he needed was Charles
" uskaa kahana he, 'vahi meraa sachcha pyaar he' haalanki jail main vah apane pati ke gaal tak nahin chhu sakati
 "the marriage ceremony took place in jail in 2008, Mambetti went to jail with sindoor and thali on the day of 'dashain' (dussehra)
 vadhoo ne bina baaju vaali gulabi or kaali dress pahani thi, var safed kameez or apni khaas topi pahane tha
 The prison guards allowed him to be taken to Sindoor thinking that he was a vaccine
 thapa ne bataaya, ''shobhraj ne meri beti ko moti kaa haar pahanaaya jo hamaare yahaan mangalsutra kaa kaam karata he
 "bhava-vibhor Nihita confirmed the marriage, she told the media that she fell in love at first sight," she looked into my eyes and i forgot everything
 ''bacchon jaisi nihitha, jise hindi filmi gaanon (khaskar pakija kaa inhen logon ne
 
 
 ) But was very fond of dancing, suddenly came into the role of a protector
 use apane pati kii begunaahi par drudh vishwaas he
 Answering questions from India Today, she said that some of the questions were "gruesome", she said, "I know Charles is not a milkman but i don't understand why you just talk about legal punishment
" Why does she not want legal freedom? If Nepal's decision proves anything, it is that the judiciary did nothing but shame itself
 ''nihitha media dwaara unke vivaah kii aalochana se dukhi hai or vah press se milane ke bare main maun rahati he
 Thapa says, "he loves Charles dearly
" vah hat ke (alag tarah kii) ladki he
 Please do not write anything that will harm my daughter
 vah bholibhali he, main isaki ijaajat nahin duungi
 "he said," There is a picture of him in a newspaper which has written perfect match? " i do not like the question mark, please do not hurt my daughter
 ''nihitha ke anusaar, nepal kii 'gaiyrkanoonee sajaa' ne use buree tarah pareshaan kar diya he
 "but this should not make us weak, things have become difficult for me and them here
" hamaara majaak na udaaya jaae
 After his release, i will see that everything changes
 '' nihitha ne haal hi main shobhraj ko man bahalane ke liye ek safed chuha diya
 She goes to buy food for him every day
 thapa yaad karti hai, ''jab shobhraj kii billi biimaar hui, usne usase billi ke liye amul doodh mangaya
 i told him that i will bring the rabbit for you, you kill him and feed the cat, but he said, Mom i cannot bleed
 ''jail main nihitha or shobhraj kaa pehla romance nahin he
 Over 21 years in Tihar Jail, India, the 50-year-old lady killer fell in love with a 34-year-old German woman, Jacqueline Kuster, who was imprisoned under a narcotics law
 use likhe gaye kuch patr india today ke paas hai
 Her marriage to a young and straightforward Nihita is similar to her love for Custer
 patron main, charles ne castor ko is tarah guide kiya ki media kaa dhyaan uski taraf aa sake
 He told her, "let me handle the media
 aisa hamaare hit main he
 "he taught Custer how to present his love in a romantic way
" 
 
 taaki hedline bane ki charles shobhraj ko pyaar ho gaya he
 According to the story, Custer had to tell the media that "the two slowly began to have a good conversation, he turned to friendship and then fell in love
" hamaara rishta maansikta se judaa tha
 "he thought that this would make his" image more serious "
 shobhraj elvis presli ke gaanon kii panktiyon (vil you bi maai tedi bear) se lubhaata tha, vah use maa cheri or mine libkin ke naam se bulaata tha or francisi kavi paul varalen ko uddhrut karata thah main tumse aaj prem karata hum / aane vaale kal se kam / lekin beete hue kal se zyada
 Many times he used to say to Custer in the simple way, "do not overburden my heart and mind, i am what i am, simple, and i want you to love me as i am
" 
 
 jaisaa ki maine tumse kaha, main sarvshereshth nahin hum, lekin main tumhaare liye sarvshereshth banane kii koshish karuunga
 "he was worried that the rest would fill his mind against him and caution him," "don't listen to the people in jail who talk about us
" unhen koi matlab nahin hona chahie or ve bahut bade murkh hai, unka jivan or dimag itnaa chota he ki unamem se koi bhi kisi bhi bare main tumhen salaah nahin de saktaa
 
 
 "even in his most emotional moments, the media has never been out of his mind
" vah likhata he, ''main tumse prem or prem or prem karata hum, ham donon pagal ho gaye hai
 
 
 a good film can be made on the story of our meeting and love
 ''uske patr dekhakar yah bhi pataa lagata he ki kaise usne jail kii vyavastha kaa phayda uthaaya
 He used to schedule a meeting with Custer at LNJP Hospital in Delhi so that they would arrive there at the same time
 ''opidi main mujhe subah saadhe nau baje kaa samay diya gaya, lekin main 10 baje pahunchoongaa taaki meraa milane kaa samay radd ho jaae or mujhe dobaaraa aana pade
 We will meet at LNJP at least once a week
 ''dilli kii tihaad jail main 21 saal kii kaid main uski teen premicaayen thim
 The first young Indian lawyer, Sneh Sanger, was soon replaced by Custer
 baad main usne ek punjabi ladki manabina phullar ko lubhaaya, jise uski jeevani padhane ke baad usase prem ho gaya tha
 Sobhraj said he wanted to marry Fuller but feared that the girl's parents would object
 ''bharat main kya hota he
 You know ''tihaad main uski mulaakaat rajan pillai, sukhram or chandraswami se hui or adaalat main upasthit hone ke dauraan vah unke bare main patrakaron ko bataata tha
 He once said about Sukhram, "he is not very intelligent but i think he is fine as a leader
" '' usne ek janhit yachika (piiel) daayar karke kaha ki 1995 main tihaad jail mempillai kii maut dhan vasuulne or utpeedan kaa nateeja thi
 According to PIL, "she (pillai) was abused, bullied and demanded money, kicked, even asked to clean the floor
" uske swasthya kii taraf paryaapt dhyaan nahin diya jaataa tha
 The PIL also revealed how one officer asked Pillai for a Maruti car, while another wanted money to be given to the wife before she was allowed to meet him
 shobhraj ne bharat chhodte samay kaha tha, ''bharat kii adaalatein nishpaksh hai
 He had reason to rejoice as he was acquitted by the court for the murder of French tourist Luke Solomon
 ab jab use phir hatya kaa doshi tehraaya ja rahaa he, to vah apane upar galat mukadmaa chalaae jane kaa daawa kar rahaa he
 Now if he manages to overturn the decision of the Nepal court, another chapter will be added to the life of Charles Sobhraj's crime

 videsh mantri salmaan khurshid ne buudhvaar ko yah kehete hue bhaajapa ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ko aade haath liya ki unhone beete 27 aktubar ko patna main apni raajnneetik raily ke aayojan sthal gandhi maidan main bam dhamaakon ke baavjood raily kii
 Taking a dig at Modi, Khurshid said that despite the blasts, his real character of not taking care of anyone by holding a rally has been revealed
 videsh mantri ne kaha, ‘kya unki (peediton kii) jaan kii koi keemat nahin thi jo unhen dekhne aae the
 He did not even say that he is very sad about what has happened, see Modi's behavior in this rally
 ’ He said, 'his behavior in the rally was not right
 unhone kisi kii parvaah nahin kii
 If he had cared, he would have said that today is not the day of my speech
 aaj do minute kaa maun rakhkar ham logon ko janaa chahie
 ' gauratlab he ki 27 aktubar ko patna ke gandhi maidan main modi kii hunkaar raily se pehle maidan or iske aasapaas ke ilaakon main saat dhamaake hue
 Six people were killed in the blasts while 82 others were injured
 khurshid ne kaha ki modi kisi bhi aise shaks se baat nahin karte jo sawaal kar saktaa ho or jo unase asahmat ho saktaa ho
 He said, 'he doesn't talk to people
 vah logon par baat karte hai or kisi loktantr main yadi aap logon par baat karte hai to use acha nahin kaha ja saktaa
 We want to talk to people
 rahul gandhi apane tareeke se logon se baat karne kii koshish karte hai
 ' videsh mantri ne kaha, ‘modi kaa style yah he ki unhone jo kah diya vah antim satya ho gaya
 No one has the right to question them
 ’ Senior Congress leader Khurshid also defended the statement made by Rahul during a rally in Rajasthan in which the Congress Vice President said that the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI was contacting some victims of the communal violence in Muzaffarnagar
 khurshid ne kaha, ‘bombai bam dhamaakon kaa daud se koi lenaa-dena nahin tha yaa daud kaa iesai se kuch lenaa-dena nahin he
 They exploited Bombay and we must fight this exploitation
 rahul gandhi duusare shabdon main vahi baat kah rahe hai
 We have to fight any exploitation
 shoshan se ladane kaa tarika yah he ki kisi ko bhi manovaigyanik taur par kamjor na banane diya jaae
 ' khurshid ne yah kehete hue bhaajapa or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ko bhi aade haath liya, ‘kya yah dohari bayaanbaji nahin he ki modi kehete hai ki rahul gandhi ko apni tippanee ke liye maafee maangani chahie jabaki sangh kaa kahana he ki rahul sahi kah rahe hai
 Why does Modi not ask the Sangh that he should apologize for justifying Rahul
 spasht taur par pehle unhen apane logon ko maafee ke liye kahana chahie
 ' kendriya mantri ne kaha, ‘pikchar abhi baaki he
 The story is not over yet
 kahani sirf haar or jeet kii nahin he
 Modi thinks that this issue is a win-win
 hamaare liye yah haar-jeet kaa maamla nahin he
 For us, it is about the idea of india
 yadi ham haarate hai or bharat kaa vichaar jivit rahata he to hamen koi samasya nahin he
 But if we win and the idea of india does not exist then it is nothing
 ’ Khurshid said, 'modi is exactly opposite to the idea of india and the idea of india will survive
 bharat kaa vichaar hameshaa modi se zyada taqatvar rahegaa or isliye bharat kaa vichaar jivit he or rahegaa, ladaai rahul gandhi or narendra modi ke bich kii nahin he
 The battle is for the heartland of India for the idea of india

 As the name suggests, the reverse repo rate is inverted from the repo rate stated above

 Banks can keep that amount in the Reserve Bank to keep with them, on which they also get interest from RBI
 jis dar par yah byaaj unhen miltaa he, use reverse repo rate kehete hai
 However, many times the Reserve Bank feels that there is too much cash in the market, then it increases the reverse repo rate
 isse hota yah he ki bank zyada byaaj kamaane ke liye apana paisa rigerv bank ke paas rakhane lagate hai

 His "divine" powers may have overshadowed his victims, but Asaram Bapu's aura still remains intact
 agast 2013 se asaram jodhpur kii jail main he lekin uski chalbajiyaan thamane kaa naam nahin le raheen
 Three of the total ten witnesses have been killed in two rape cases registered in Jodhpur and Ahmedabad, one missing for the last three months and the fifth living under the shadow of constant fear, as Asaram's goons on top of him inside his house Had committed a fatal attack
 police agar in maamalon main jaanch kar bhi rahi he to vah itani sust he ki bache-khuche gavaahon ke man main yah ashanka prabal hoti ja rahi he ki is sab ke peeche asaram kaa hi haath he or vah unhen nahin chhodega
 For example, in Shahjahanpur in Uttar Pradesh, where the girl who lodged a rape case against Asaram lives with her family, the police has made little progress in investigating the attack on the witnesses
 peedita ke pita charanvir (naam parivartit) ke mitra elisi agent kripal singh par ghar lautate vakt golibari kii gai thi
 Before the death two days later, he had named three of Asaram's associates Arjun, Raghav and Sanjeev Kumar who fired at him
 teenon ab tak faraar hai jabaki ghatana ko chah maheene guzar chuke hai
 The two persons Narayan Pandey and Pradeep have been apprehended, according to Charanvir, they were not involved in the shootout, but they had only inspected the opportunity for the three attackers
 shahjahanpur ke police adheekshak bablu kumaar ne india today ko bataaya, “ham asal doshiyon ko pakadaaey kii puri koshish kar rahe hai
 From Surat to Jodhpur Police, we have had the most contact
 ”charanvir ne 20 minute kii phone par baatcheet kaa ek tepe bhi police ko saunpa he jo kathith taur par kripal or asaram ke bich 23 sitambar, 2014 ko hui baatcheet kaa he jisamen asaram jodhpur kii jail ke bheetar se use kah rahaa he ki vah charanvir ko paise lekar mukadmaa waapas lene ke liye raji kare
 Charanvir is confident that this voice is from Asaram
 vah aawaaj kahati he, “tum unako samjhaao
 "it is said in that voice that some money will be given as advance and later they will give" sau taka "(10 lakh in the language of Asaram)
 shahjahanpur police ne ab tak is aawaaj kaa pareekshan nahin karavaaya he
 This work takes just three days but six months have passed
 is bare main puche jane par kumaar kaa jawaab tha, “tepe main aawaaj saaf nahin thi, isliye hamane uskaa pareekshan karwaanaa jaruri nahin samajha
 ”charanvir alleges that there are several reasons to consider it as the voice of Asaram
 pehali baat to yah he ki agar aawaaj uski nahin hoti, to uske samarthakon ke liye sabase aam baat us channel ke khilaaf manahani kaa mukadmaa darj karwaane kii hoti jisane tepe chalaaya tha
 Subsequent events make sense of what the voice is saying
 tepe main vah aawaaj kripal se yah kehete hue pai jaati he ki use 23 sitambar ko doctoron kii report mil jaaegi (jiske aadhaar par vah antarim jamaanat kii maang kar rahaa tha)

 However, in the report given by doctors of Medical College, Jodhpur, it was said that he has trigeminal neuralgia and will have to undergo surgery
 supreme court main charanvir kii apil ke baad dilli ke akhil bhartiya ayurvigyaan santhaan (ames) se asaram kaa chikitsiya pareekshan karne ko kaha gaya
 Aquas' report concluded that Asaram did not need surgery
 shahjahanpur kii police ne dainik jaagran ke patrkaar narendra yadav par bhi jaanaleva hamale kii jaanch nahin kii he jinhone “asaram afat main” naam se is balaatkaar cond ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaaya tha
 Yadav was attacked by unidentified assailants on September 17, 2014 with knives
 asaram ke gurgon ne unhen abhiyaan waapas lene or charanvir kii madad na karne ke liye paanch lakh ru
 Was offered a bribe of Rs
 is maamle main bhi ab tak koi giraftaar nahin hui he
 When asked about this, Javed Ahmed, who recently took over as Director General of Police in Uttar Pradesh, said, "we will take these cases on priority basis and get justice done to all

 kanpur se 100 kilometre dur nimadha gaanv main rahane vaale ram kumaar sachaan dukhi hai kyonki unka betaa rahul 25 november, 2015 se hi laapata he
 Rahul, a key witness in Asaram's case, was stabbed by Asaram's devotee Satya Narayan Gwala while going to a trial in Jodhpur district court in February 2015
 is hamale main use aanshik rup se lakva maar gaya or uski yaaddaasht bhi chali gai
 In a statement to the Jodhpur police in connection with the attack on him, Sachan had said that he saw Asaram asking Gwala to stab him in a gesture
 hamale ke baad sachaan lakhanu chale aae the or unhone police se 24 ghante suraksha kii maang kii thi
 Instead, he was provided with a security guard for only eight hours
 sachaan 25 november ko gaayab hue lekin unke surakshakarmi amit kumaar singh ne 12 disambar ko isaki shikaayat police main likhavai
 When asked about this, sub-inspector Vijay Pandey lightly denies any conspiracy, "we are confident that Sachan will return as he himself has disappeared
" ” ve asaram se use kisi khatre kii baat ko kaan tak nahin dete
 Rahul's father says, "there are only three possibilities
" use yaa to asaram ke kehane par maar diya gaya yaa agava kar liya gaya he yaa phir vah khud kisi aghoshit vajah se chhip gaya he
 "mahendra Chawla has no doubt that Sachan has been killed
 asaram ke bete narayan sai ke nijee sahyogi rah chuke or donon ke khilaaf mukademon main gavaah chawla ko panipat ke kareeb apane paitruk gaanv sanoli khurd main desi katte se goli maar di gai thi
 He gave concrete evidence to the police, yet no arrests have been made in the case so far
 unhone apni shikaayat main kaha tha ki unhen asaram ke maamle main gavaah na banane ke liye ek karod ru
 Was offered a bribe of Rs
 panipat ke sthaneey vakil or asaram ke bhakt nishanth ghanghas ne unhen suutakes main rakhe nakad rupye dikhaae the, aisa unhone police ko bataaya tha
 Ghanghus was arrested, but Chawla alleges that the police made such a weak case against him that he got bail within three days
 chawla ne police ko bataaya tha ki asaram ke bodyguard hanuman ne unhen jaan se maarane kii dhamkee di thi kyonki ve asaram ke hiton ko nuksaan pahunchaa rahe the
 Despite the government complaint, no action was taken on it
 is bare main puche jane par rohtak range ke police mahanireekshak shrikant yadav bataate hai, “panipat ke espi rahul sharma is bare main behatar jaanate honge lekin jahaan tak meri jaankaree he, jaanch ab bhi jari he
 Once Narayan Sai is questioned, things will move forward
 hamane gujarat police se use hamen saunpane kii maang kii he
 There was no contact with Sharma on his cellphone or in the office
 chawla bataate hai ki lakhanu se sachaan ke gaayab hone ke do din pehle usne chawla ko phone karke kaha tha ki “kal bukamp aayega
 "they were talking about Sai's wife Janaki, who came to the media on November 24 to expose the father and son's misdeeds
 chawla bataate hai ki sachaan ne narendra yadav ko whotsap par sandesh bheja tha, “uttar pradesh yaa haryana main asaram ke mukademe ke gavaahon par jaanaleva hamalon main jo ek baat samaan he vah yah he ki police ne jaan-boojhkar jaanch ko dhilaa rakhaa he yaa kahen ki vah sidhe taur par asaram ke kahe mutabik kaam kar rahi he jabaki asaram ke khilaaf lage aarope vishwasaneey or thos hai
 The police have not deliberately questioned Asaram
 sachaan ke maamle main saaf he ki vah asaram kaa nishaanaa bana he kyonki usne janaki ko prerit kiya tha
 Guharaj Chawla from CBI is in depression
 ve kehete hai, “police kaa yahi ravaiya rahaa to hamaare bachane kii ummid nahin he jab tak ki supreme court apni nigaraanee main sibiai jaanch kaa aadesh nahin de detii or khud asaram se poochtacha nahin kar lee jaati
 "narendra Chandra Gupta is also expecting this
 akhil gupta ke pita kehete hai ki in hatyaon kii sibiai jaanch hi unhen bachaa sakati he
 Akhil Gupta had been Asaram's personal aide and cook until 2005, who later became a witness against him
 gupta ko mujffarnagar main 11 janvari, 2015 ko goli maar di gai thi jab ve apni deyari se motorcycle par ghar ja rahe the
 This murder also passed for a year but no arrests have been made so far
 akhil ke pita kehete hai, “upi sarkaar ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki vah mere bete kii hatya kii jaanch sibiai se karavaaegi lekin ab tak kuch nahin hua he

 While Dhoni smashed 45 runs in 63 runs, Bhuvneshwar also scored a brilliant 53 off 80 balls with the help of 4 fours and 1 six

 fernando ke is over kii teesri gend dhoni ke bat or pairon ke bich se hokar sidhe stump par ja lagi thi, lekin baavjood iske dhoni out nahin ho sake

 log apni-apni jagah baithe kaam kar rahe hai
 Suddenly, some policemen enter the office with a cashless criminal
 police ko dekhte hi daphtar ke get par tainaat security guard bhi peeche hat jaataa he
 Now all the policemen have entered the office regarding the crime
 wo aate hi elaan karte hai ki unhen ye khabar mili he ki is shaatir mulzim kaa yahaan is daftar main aana-janaa he
 Therefore, it is very important to get all the people working here to identify it
 pulisavaalon kaa hukum milte hi yahaan kaam karne vaale tamaam log counter se baahar daphtar ke saamne vaale hisse main aa jate hai
 Meanwhile, while working as a precaution, he also asks the security guard of the office to come in and close the shutter of the office immediately
 pulisavaalon kaa hukum maanakar wo thik vaisaa hi karata he, jaisaa usase kaha jaataa he
 Till then, the policemen keep the masked accused in a corner near the gate
 ab pulisavaale mulzim kii pahchaan ke liye uske chehre se naqaab hataate hai
