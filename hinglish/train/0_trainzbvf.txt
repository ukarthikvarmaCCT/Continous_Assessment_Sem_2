 modi magic ke sahare upi main prachand bahumat se jitkar satta main ai bijepi ne siem ke naam par faisla karne main ek haftaa lagaaya
 There was a lot of churning from Lucknow to Delhi
 tamaam daavedaaron ke naamon par charchaa hui or ab yogi adityanath ke naam par muhar lag gai he
 After all, what were the reasons that Yogi Adityanath became the frontrunner in the race for the chair of UP
 1
 bjp's hesitation with a strong majority ended in 325 seats, winning 325 seats, with a strong majority, there was no dilemma about the cm's name in front of the BJP which came to power in UP
 kaaran he bahumat itnaa bada mila ki modi or amit shah ke saamne kisi ke paksh main bhi faisle lene kii aazaadee thi
 The biggest contender Rajnath Singh withdrew his name and Yogi Adityanath became the frontrunner in the CM race, leaving behind contenders like Keshav Maurya and Manoj Sinha
 2
 The image of a hardcore Hindutvaist is also considered close to the Adityanath Sangh
 gorakhpur se saansad yogi adityanath gorakhnath mandir ke mahant hai or hindu yuva vahini ke sansthaapak bhi hai
 He has often shown his staunch stance on issues like Love Jihad and Ram Mandir
 hindu vahini ke jariye adityanath hindu yuvaaon ko ekajute kar saamaajik, saanskrithik or rashtravaadi muddon par purvanchal main maahaul apane paksh main rakhane main kaamyaab rahe hai
 This image of Yogi Adityanath can be quite useful for the BJP which came to power in UP with the promise of construction of Ram temple
 3
 Strong ground grip and long political experience Adityanath has been a Gorakhpur MP for five consecutive times
 yogi adityanath gorakhpur loksabhaa seat se 2014 main teen lakh se bhi adhik siton se chunaav jite the
 Won by more than two lakh votes in 2009
 purvanchal kii 60 se adhik siton par yogi adityanath kii pakad maani jaati he
 The rest of the contenders left behind Yogi here
 4
 Modi's focus on Purvanchal In 2014, when Narendra Modi came out to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Varanasi, it was indicated that the BJP would focus on Purvanchal to win the war of UP
 loksabhaa kii 80 main se 73 siten bijepi or sahyogiyon ne jeet lee
 Now in the assembly elections also, most of the seats of Purvanchal have gone to bjp's account
 aise main siem purvanchal se hoga iske bare main lambey samay se kayaas lag rahe the
 However, earlier Manoj Sinha's name was going ahead but Yogi was seen flying in the last race
 5
 The other claimants have no ground base
 The other contenders who were not involved in the race of UP CM also had no ground base in favor of Yogi
 yogi adityanath purvanchal kii 60 se adhik vidhansabha siton or kai loksabhaa kshetron main asar rakhte hai
 While the allegations against Keshav Prasad Maurya and Manoj Sinha's lack of ground hold in the region went against him
 yogi adityanath paanch baar ke saansad hai
 Even after his resignation from the Lok Sabha seat of Gorakhpur, the BJP candidate's victory is almost certain

 jammu-kashmir main chunavi haar kaa saamana karne ke baad congress ne pradesh kaaryakarini ke punargathan par manthan karnaa shuru kar diya he
 According to Congress sources, it has been suggested to make separate state presidents in Jammu and Ladakh to strengthen the party in the state
 congress ke varisht netaa gulam nabi aaazaad kii adhyakshata main ravivaar ko srinagar main pradesh congress ne chunaavon main haar ke kaarnon par manthan kiya
 In this review meeting, Congress leaders said that there is a need to reorganize the state executive

 Congress leaders believe that the party should start preparing before now to win the election by reforming before the assembly elections
 iskaa matlab he ki congress jammu main hindu or ladakh main buddha party adhyaksh bananaa chaahati he
 Let us know that in the recent Lok Sabha elections, Congress contested five out of six seats in the state
 jisamen do siton par congress ko neshnal conference party or pidipi kaa samarthan mila
 Even after this, the Congress has not been able to win even one seat
 bahujan samaaj party (bispi) kii mukhiya mayawati agle maheene 15 janvari ko apana janmdin bade hi dhoomdhaam se manaaengi

 2007 main bahumat kii sarkaar banane ke baad bhi aarthik sahyog diwas ke rup main party mukhiya kaa janmdin manaaya gaya
 But in 2008, the party and the BSP government faced all-round criticism due to Aureya's much-talked about Manoj Gupta murder
 iske baad party ne mayawati ke janmdin par aarthik sahyog lene kii parampara khatm kar di thi
 According to a top BSP leader, the BSP does not take donations from big capitalists like other parties, so the party seeks financial support from its workers

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) The Jammu and Kashmir government said today that it was a 'very unfortunate' decision to impose a curfew on eid-ul-azha on Tuesday, but to do so 'forced' to protect the lives and property of the separatists by calling for a march to the UN office
 Was lying
 varisht mantri or sarkaar ke pravaktaa naeem akhtar ne kaha ki yah kadam 2010 main ghati aisi hi ek ghatana kii punrariti hone se bachane ke liye uthaaya gaya jab pradarshnakariyon ne id kii namaaj ke baad hurriyat netaa mirwij umr farrukh ke netritv main ek march main hissaa lete hue ‘vidhvansak karrwai’ kii thi
 On the compulsion to take this controversial decision, he said, "it was very unfortunate that we had to impose curfew
" lekin yah nirnay ek vishesh paristhiti main liya gaya, jisamen kuch logon ne sanyukt raashtra karyaalay tak ek march nikaalane kaa aahvaan kiya tha
 He said, we were forced to impose curfew
 is tarah kaa ek kadam uthaanaa kisi bhi sarkaar kii chhavi ke liye kisi bhi tarah se thik nahin he lekin kanoon or vyavastha sunishchit karnaa sarkaar kii jimmedaari he
 The separatist Hizbul Mujahideen militants have been spearheading the agitation since July 9 after the killing of Burhan Wani
 unhone id-ul-ajaha ke maukey par sanyukt raashtra karyaalay tak ek march nikaalane kaa aahvaan kiya tha or sarkaar ise vifal karne ke liye patibaddh thi
 Akhtar, who is overseeing the work of the Ministry of Education, said that it was an act done in response to the call to march to the United Nations Office
 ise taala ja saktaa tha
 He said that only two months ago ird-ul-fitr (on 7 July) was celebrated brilliantly with peace in Kashmir
 ek mahila hone ke baavjood mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti us din namaaj padhane ke liye hazratbal dargah gai thim
 He said, "but now, there is a different situation
" hamen lagata he ki hamane karfu lagaakar logon kii jindagiyon ko bachaa liya he, jo sarkaar ke naate hamaari praathmik jimmedaari he
 "we have an example of 2010 when thousands of people took part in a march led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and after the Eid prayers, the demonstrators carried out a vandalism incident," Akhtar said
 algaavaadiyon ke rukh par akhtar ne kaha ki unka andolan aam kashmiriyon ke naam ko badnaam kar rahaa he or visheshkar aarthik or academik rup se rajya ko aghat pahunchaa rahaa he
 The comments akhtar ne kaha ki is pradarshan kaa arthvyavastha ,vyapaar or puri kashmir ghati par ‘dirghakaalik prabhaav’ padegaa
 He said, one of our academic sessions has already ended
 hamane jo kuch bhi acha kiya tha use barbaad kiya ja rahaa he
 He said that the leaders leading the movement should reconsider their strategy, their slogans and their political roadmap

 unhone kaha, ‘‘lekin ab, vahaan ek alag sthiti he

 The Delhi High Court has sought a status report from the Delhi Police in the case of Airhostess Anishia's suicide
 yah states report anisia ke saas sasur kii agrim jamaanat yachika par sunwaayee ke dauraan hoicourt kii taraf se maangi gai he
 The High Court has currently stayed the arrest of Anishia's mother-in-law father-in-law Sushma Singhvi and RS Singhvi, while the hearing on the anticipatory bail petition has been postponed till August 2
 dilli hoicourt main is maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan dilli police ko notice jari kar states report dene ko bhi kaha he, jisase yah saaf ho sake ki abhi police kii jaanch kahaan tak pahunchi he
 Explain that accused Mayank Singhvi is the husband of the deceased Anishia Batra
 anisia batrane kuch vakt pehle hi hauj khaas sthit apane sasuraal main aatmahatya kar lee thi
 Anishia's parents alleged that she was murdered and her in-laws were constantly harassing her for dowry
 anisia kaa pati mayank singhvi philhal nyaayik hiraasat main he
 Mayank's parents were shocked by the Saket court, after the Saket court did not grant anticipatory bail to the parents of the accused, after which they moved the High Court
 pataa ho ki beete shuukravaar ko anisia ke saas sasur sushamaa singhvi or ares singhvi ne saket court main bhi agrim jamaanat yachika lagaai thi
 But the court rejected both the pleas and said that no advance bail can be granted at this stage of investigation
 saket court se aae is faisle ke baad hi somvaar ko anisia ke saas sasur ne dilli hoicourt kaa rukh kiya tha
 Although the Delhi High Court is yet to pronounce its decision after further hearing on the anticipatory bail plea, at present, the sword of arrest has been deferred till August 2 by the Delhi Police
 chambal ke bihadon kaa naam aate hi logon ke jehan main daakuon ke naam aane lagate hai
 There were many dacoits in Chambal whose name also shook the police
 lekin aisi mahilaon kii bhi kami nahin, jinhone bihadon par purush dakaiton kii tarah hi raaj kiya
 Even in cases of murder, robbery, robbery and kidnapping, those women robberies did not lag behind
 aisi hi paanch kukhyat dasyu sundariyon ke bare main ham aapako bataane ja rahe hai
 Phoolan Devidaku Phoolan Devi is considered a notorious dacoit in the rugged
 jise vakt or halaat ne daaku banane par majaboor kar diya tha
 He was gang-raped
 jiske baad vah mahaj 16 saal kii umr main daaku ban gai thi
 He had massacred 22 people of Rajput society to avenge rape
 baad main varsh 1983 main phulan devi ne sarender kar diya tha
 About a year later, when she got out of jail, she turned to politics
 sapa ke tikat par usne mirzapur se do baar loksabhaa chunaav ladaa or vah saansad rahi
 But in the year 2001, Phoolan Devi was shot dead outside her government residence in Delhi
 seemaa parihaaraun dinon behad main daaku lala ram or daaku kusuma nine kaa raaj tha
 People used to tremble in his name
 usee dauraan in donon 13 saal kii ek ladki ko agava kar liya tha
 That girl's name was Seema Parihar
 behad main rahane ke dauraan seemaa ko dakaiton ne kii jivan style itani pasand ai ki usne bhi daaku banane kii thaan lee
 Reaching the threshold of youth, the name of Border Parihar had become a terror in Chambal
 uske sir par lagbhag 6 darjan logon kii hatya kaa aarope tha
 While he had more than two hundred cases of kidnapping in his name
 varsh 2000 main seemaa ne police ke saamne sarender kar diya tha
 After this, a few years ago she also appeared in the popular TV show Bigg Boss
 putali biputali bai ko chambal kii pehali mahila daaku mana jaataa he
 His real name was Gauharbano
 uske saath hui julm jyaadati ne use hathiyaar uthaane par majaboor kar diya tha
 Chambal was once ruled by the ravines
 uskaa naam aaj bhi chambal ke bihadon main bahadur or usoolpasand daaku ke rup main liya jaataa he
 He was born in a very poor family
 baad main wo ek naachne vaali ban gai
 After that, his name was changed from Gauharbano to Putlibai
 ek baar mashhoor daaku sultanaa ne ek jagah use naachte hue dekha or tabhi se wo use naachne ke liye bulaane laga
 Gradually the robber Sultana put her heart to Putlibai and after that she started living in the ravines with the robber Sultana
 sultanaa kii maut ke baad putalibai giroh kii sardaar ban gai thi
 He had a lot of terror in the fifties
 kusamaa ninkusamaa nine behad kaa janaa mana naam tha
 He was known for his toughness
 mana jaataa he ki kanpur dehaat ke behamai cond kaa badla lene ke liye vah daaku ban gai thi
 In fact, 22 Rajputs were mass murdered by the robber Phoolan Devi in that case
 jiske chalate kusamaa ne baad main 14 mallahon ko maut neend kii sula diya tha
 Kusma was considered to be the infamous Dasu Sundari of Chambal
 usne santosh or raajbahadur naamak do mallahon kii ankhen nikaal kar berahami kii nai ibaarat likh di thi
 The name Renu Yadavadasu Sundari Renu Yadav came into the limelight before the UP assembly elections
 vah raajnneeti main aana chaahati thi, lihaaja usne akhilesh yadav se kai baar mulaakaat kii thi
 That dacoit was with Chandan Yadav in the rugged Chambal
 uske khilaaf hatya, apharan or dakaiti ke kai maamle darj the
 Renu was born in Jamalipur village in Auraiya district
 29 navambar, 2003 ko chaaku chandan yadav ke giroh ne use agava kar liya tha
 She was going to school at the time of the kidnapping
 uskaa parivaar use talashta rahaa
 Kept pleading with the police but the police had done nothing
 baad main daakuon ne uske gharavaalon se phiroti maangi thi
 But his family was unable to pay
 bas tabhi se wo us gang main hi pali badi
 He later surrendered in Etawah
 kerala main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (RSS) ke kaaryakartaaon ke khilaaf hinsa thamane kaa naam nahin le rahi he
 The attack on RSS worker has been reported once again in Kannur
 nidhish naam ke RSS kaaryakarta par ravivaar shaam kannur ke idakkad main hamalaa kiya gaya
 Earlier on 10 October, RSS worker Suresh was beaten with an iron rod by pulling him out of an auto rickshaw in Thalassery, Kerala
 haath, pair or sir par chotaravivaar ke hamale main buree tarah se ghayal kaaryakarta ko pehle thalasseri ke aspataal main bhartee kiya gaya, phir kosikod ke aspataal le jaaya gaya
 The hands, legs and head of the worker have been attacked
 police ko shaq he ki is hamale ke peeche CPM kaaryakartaaon kaa haath he, lekin abhi isaki pushti nahin ho saki he
 At the same time, the identity of the attackers is still pending
 kerala main BJP kii jan raksha yatraarajya menkaaryakartaaon kii hatya va hinsa kii ghatnaonke virodh main bijepi 15 dinon kii 'jan raksha yatra' nikaal rahi he
 On Saturday, Union Minister Smriti Irani attacked the left government of the state
 unhone kaha tha ki kerala kii sipiem sarkaar ne kerala jaise khubasurat rajya ko raajnneetik kabristaan bana diya
 He had said that the CPM thinks that it can scare us by committing violence, but the BJP can behead but cannot bow its head
 hamane desh bachaane ke liye ladaai karne kii kasam khai he
 The BJP is continuously attacking the Left by taking Jan Raksha Yatra in the state

 in dinon pakistan main soshal media par ek tasviir teji se share kii ja rahi he
 In the picture, something is seen sitting in a white cloth on the mound of the outer wall of a desolate house
 kareeb se dekhne par yah thodaa daraavna lag rahaa he
 This is the reason why on social media it is being described as a 'witch's picture'
 soshal media ke mutabik kathith 'chudail' kii yah tasviir pakistan ke hyderabad shahar kii he
 In which a witch is sitting on the wall of the house and many people are taking pictures of her
 jab is tasviir ko pakistani singer fakhir mahmud ne share kiya uske baad yah viral ho gai
 Fakhir wrote while sharing the picture, "can anyone confirm? It is being told that this picture is of a 'witch' which was taken by all the people at midnight in Hyderabad
" " tasviir ke viral hote hi is par bahes chhid gai ki yah tasviir asli yaa phir farji
 The funny thing is that this picture is actually from Morocco and not Hyderabad
 or usase bhi badi baat yah he ki ye tasviir kiseinsaan yaa chudailki nahin balki ek gudiya kii he
 The doll was given a witch-like appearance to scare the bandits
 matlab ghar kaa maalik sochataa tha ki chudail ke dar se raat main daaku uske ghar dhaava nahin bolenge
 Funny comments - saw the first witch that people are not afraid of at all - this angel of her father looks like this without makeup - this girl was making a cake, when the whole maida fell on her, then people consider it a witch
 - This girl was going on a date when she became a witch - a socially active witch posing for Facebook, whatsapp, Twitter, Instagram and linkedin - She is a sophisticated witch who poses in front of the camera
 Giving is Wah ji wah nowadays what has come over fear in people that age, is sitting witch fun and people are pulling his photo desh ke share bazaaron main mangalvaar ko teji darj kii gai

 gaanv waalon kaa maananaa he ki kanyadan ke maukey par nashamukt baaraati le jane kaa sankalp liya ja rahaa he
 This is possible in Pariharpur village of Madhubani's Rajnagar block, thanks to a teacher, Ravindra Jha, who is taking the initiative to rid people of Gandhigiri with noble thought, honest effort and unwavering faith

 About five years ago, Ravindra came from Jamshedpur in Jharkhand and started teaching children in a school as a panchayat teacher
 unhen yahaan ke nashapan ko dekhakar vah is gaanv se waapas lautne kii yojana bana lee thi, parantu kuch bujurgon ke kehane par vah ruk gaye or gaanv se nashakhori samaapt karne kii thaan lee
 With unwavering faith and vowing not to back down from this task, Ravindra started this noble cause from the house of alcoholics
 rabindra ne bataaya ki vah sabase pehle gaanv ke sabase bade piyakkad, par pratibhavan gramin ke ghar pahunche or unase haath jodakar sharaab chhod dene kaa anurodh kiya
 For this, he asked for a few days time from Ravindra
 die gaye samay ke uparaant shikshak rabindra phir unke ghar pahunch gaye
 This policy paid off and she succumbed to the qualifying drinker Ravindra's Gandhigiri and not only gave up alcohol, but he joined the campaign
 iske baad ve donon gum-ghumkar sharaabiyon ke ghar ja-jaakar unase sharaab chhodane kaa anurodh karne lage
 This teacher's policy proved effective and people started joining this campaign
 rabindra kehete hai ki sharaab pine vaale nai, dukandaar, sabji bechney vaale se graminon ne khariddaari tak band kar di
 After this, the business of selling liquor by requesting liquor sellers was stopped
 is abhiyaan ke liye gaanvon main mashaal juluus, cycle raily nikaali gai or graminon kii baithken bhi kii gai
 Ravindra says that now the liquor has stopped completely in this village
 aasapaas ke gaanv vaale bhi is abhiyaan ko apane gaanvon main prarambh kar chuke hai
 After the decision of the villagers, guests who drink and drink are also not welcomed
 gramin sujith jha kehete hai ki aaj gaanv main aane vaale baaraati bhi sharaab pikar nahin aate or na hi yahaan ke yuva sharaab ko haath lagaate hai

Some social media users are claiming that there is going to be a 7-day long holiday in banks, due to which there will be no money in atms
 in post main logon se yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki ve pehle se cash nikaal len
 Facebook user "ayek Apan" has claimed that "strike has been announced in banks on 26 and 27 September"
 28 ko chauthaa shanivaar he
 Sunday is 29th
 30 sitambar ko ardhvarshik bandi he
 Most staff will be on holiday on 1 October
 2 oktober ko gandhi jayanti kii chuttee he
 Therefore, the next working day in banks after September 25 will be on October 3
 saat din tak bainkon main kaam nahin hoga
 Most atms will be empty after September 27
 isliye pehle se hi atm se paise nikaal len kyonki aap sabji or machhlee vagairah ke liye super market or mal ke alaava aap kahin bhi digital pement nahin kar sakate
 The archived version of the post can be viewed
 india today ke anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne paaya ki is post main chhuttiyon kii jo list di gai he, vah sahi nahin he
 a two-day strike was called in the banks, but there is no holiday in the banks on 30 September
 AFWA ne bainkon main hadtaal ko lekar google search kiya to pataa chalaa ki chaar rashtriya bainkon ke karmchaaree unionon ne hadtaal kaa aahvaan kiya tha
 These are All India Bank Officers Confederation, All India Bank Officers Association, Indian National Bank Officers Congress and National Organization of Bank Officers
 yah hadtaal bainkon ke vilay ke virodh main bulaai gai thi
 However, this strike was withdrawn after getting assurances from the government
 is bare mentimes of indiyaki yah khabar dekhi ja sakati he
 Therefore, on 26 and 27 September, all banks will generally operate as usual
 28 sitambar ko maheene kaa chauthaa shanivaar he or 29 ko ravivaar he
 Banks will remain closed on both these days
 lekin 30 sitambar or 1 oktober ko koi chuttee nahin he
 a spokesperson for India's largest national bank 'state Bank of India' (SBI) said, "all the branches of SBI will continue to operate normally this week
 agle hafte bhi saamaanya kaamkaaj hoga, graahakon ko koi asuvidha nahin hone ja rahi he
 All facilities like ATM, digital transaction and online banking will be available 24 hours
 ”iske alaava,rigerv bank of indiyane bhi apni chhuttiyon kii list main 30 sitambar or 1 oktober ko nahin rakhaa he
 Even on the day of the half-year detention, banking transactions and other operations continue in a normal manner
 sirf 2 oktober ko gandhi jayanti ke din rashtriya avkaash hoga
 In this way it is clear that banks across the country do not have a seven-day holiday from September 26 to October 2
 soshal media post main jo daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki bank band rahane se atm khaali rahenge, yah daawa bhi galat he

 Shivanandan on Saturday called Indian Police Service Officer Deputy Police Commissioner V
 en salve, sahaayak police ayukta prakaash vaani or teen anya pulicekarmiyon ke nilamban kii sifarish kii
 The Maharashtra government on Friday ordered an inquiry into the allegations that Salve and Wani were accompanied by senior police inspector Tulsidas Khakkar and a police inspector of the anti-illegal cell and a constable from the Chembur police station
 shivanandan ne kaha, ‘‘maine rajya sarkaar se paanchon pulicekarmiyon ke khilaaf anushaasanamak karrwai shuru karne or unhen jaanch lambit rahane tak nilambit karne kii sifarish kii he
 He added that there are 'CCTV footage' and photographs which can prove that these officers were present at a party in a private gymnasium in suburban Chembur
 kaha jaataa he ki yah party giroh ke kuch sheersh gurgon kii rihaai kii khushi main yojit hui thi

 He said, "this is a conspiracy against me
 main gymkhane kaa sadsy hum or main vahaan giroh ke kisi gurgey ke saath party ke liye nahin, balki apni patni ke saath raatri bhoj ke liye gaya tha
 The party is said to have been given by Paulson Joseph, a close aide of Chhota Rajan, who is said to be looking after the business interests of the underworld leader in the suburbs of Mumbai
 gymkhana ke sutron ne kaha ki joseph ek club kaa sadsy he jiskaa sadsyta shulk paanch lakh rupee he
 He goes there playing cards and partying regularly
 naam jaahir nahin karne kii shart par sutron ne kaha ki har mehmaan ke liye 30-30 rupee kii raashi adaa kar ek sadsy kitne bhi atithiyon ko apane saath laa saktaa he
 When asked if a police officer was present at Joseph's party, he said, "many people come to the club on Christmas

 '' arvind kejariwal sarkaar kii ore se maheene main 20 hajaar litre pani ke baad ab dau sau unit bijli bhi free kar di gai he
 At the same time, work is going on to provide free travel facilities to women in the metro
 aise main bijli, pani or metro main muft yatra kii ghoshnaaon se dilli sarkaar ke khajaane par aane vaale vakt main or boj badhegaa
 The reason is that the government will have to compensate the loss from free announcements by giving subsidy
 dilli sarkaar ke kul bajet kaa aakaar kareeb 60 hajaar karod rupee tak kaa he
 Now, the government will have to give a subsidy of two and a half thousand crore rupees on free electricity
 pani par kareeb saadhe chaar sau karod rupee sabsidi pehle se di ja rahi he
 If the facility of free metro travel is also started, then subsidy will increase from 1500 crores to 2000 crores
 ab tak chaar sau unit bijli ke bill main dilli sarkaar 50 pratishat tak chhot detii thi
 Then the government had to give subsidy of Rs 1600-1700 crore to the power companies
 magar ab dau sau unit tak bijli upbhog ko sarkaar ne muft kar diya he
 Fixed charge for these consumers has also been removed
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki isse sarkaar se milane vaali sabsidi kaa aankada dhai hajaar karod rupee salanaa pahunch jayega
 The decision of the Arvind Kejriwal government will benefit 26 lakh consumers in Delhi
 vibhageeya aankade ke mutabik dilli main varsh 2018-19 main do sau unit ke bijli upabhoktaaon kii sankhya 26 lakh he vahiin dau sau se chaar sau unit vaale upabhoktaaon kii sankhya 14 lakh he
 There are a total of 47 lakh domestic electricity consumers in Delhi
 bijli vibhaag ke adhikari bataate hai ki chaar sau unit tak 50 pratishat chhot dene ke faisle ke kaaran kejariwal sarkaar ko har saal 1600-1700 karod rupee kaa boj uthaanaa padataa tha
 Explain that after the formation of the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi in February 2015, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a 50 percent rebate in electricity bill up to four hundred units
 vahiin maheene main 20 hajaar litre tak pani kaa bill bhi maaf kar diya tha
 Looking at the figures, in 2015-16, the government released 1,690 crore for water and electricity subsidy
 sirf pani kii sabsidi par kareeb 450 karod vaarshik kharch hote hai
 In 2018-19, the Arvind Kejriwal government had released Rs 1699 crore only for electricity subsidy
 raajnneetik dal matadaataaon ko lubhaane ke liye na jane kaise-kaise hatkande apanaate hai
 Keeping in mind the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections, the Congress held a worker conference in the Kiradi area of delhi, and in the name of entertainment, it was a slap of sloppy dance
 purvaanchali matadaataaon ko lubhaane ke liye bulaae gaye is sammelan main jamkar ashleel dance hua
 The leaders had called a dancer for this
 janata ke dukh-dard se konso dur ashleel dance par congressiyon ne khub note lutaae
 In this conference called for preparations for the assembly elections, the Congressmen created a lot of democracy
 stage par dancer thim or ve janata ke manoranjan ke liye thumake laga raheen thim, in thumakon par congressi note lutaa rahe the
 All this procession was decorated by local Congress leader Neeraj Jha from Kiradi area
 niraj yahaan se chunaav ladane kaa mansuba bana chuke hai or tikat pakkaa karne ke liye sammelan main pahunche netaaon ko apni bheed khinchne kii takat dikhaanaa chaahate the
 This spectacle of Congress continued for a long time in Kiradi
 dancer apni adaaen dikhaati raheen or sthaneey janata apane dukh-dard or mahangaai or vikaas kii baaten bhulaakar is saste manoranjan main uljhi rahi
 But the biggest question is why the Congress, which claims to do politics of issues and has the ability to garner votes in the name of development, had to resort to squat dance to mobilize the crowd
 kya ab dilli main congress ke aise din aa gaye hai ki janata ko ikattha karne ke liye use ashleel dance kaa sahaara lenaa pad rahaa he

 Dwivedi said that this is not a democratic way

 Ajay Kedia, head of Kedia Commodities, says, "the reason for the fall in crude oil prices is the lowering of the economic growth rate estimates by organizations like IMF and World Bank
 isaki vajah se maang kamjor hone kii sambhaavna ko bal miltaa he’’ iske alaava crude kii lagaataar bad rahi inventry bhi kachche tel kii keemton main giravat kii ek vajah he
 Crude oil prices have seen some return from the lows in the last four sessions
 is vaapasi kii vajah opek or gaiyr opek deshon kii ore se kachche tel kaa utpaadan ghataane par sahmati banane kaa asar he
 But Kedia believes this withdrawal is not going to last long
 treders upree str par bechney kii ranneeti par hi kaam karenge, aise main har choti teji ke baad giravat kii sambhaavna he
 Going up to $ 50, Kadia Brent is expecting the crude to slip to $ 50 a barrel, considering the trend in crude oil to be negative in the medium term
 unka maananaa he ki 2019 main ek baad brent crude ke bhav 50 dollar tak aa sakate hai or upar kii taraf 66 dollar kaa str majboot registence hai
 The fall in crude oil prices benefits everyone from the common man to the government
 aam janata ke lihaaj se sidhaa phayda petrol or dijal kii keemon main giravat ke rup main dekhne ko miltaa he
 Apart from this, inflation remains under control due to cheap crude oil

 After the murder of senior journalist Gauri Lankesh and journalist Sudeep Dutt Bhowmik (tripura), a sensational case of killing a journalist has now come to light in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh

 Bike attackers shot him five bullets

 Superintendent of Police (rural) Jai Prakash said that 35-year-old Naveen Gupta was riddled with bullets when he was leaving the public toilet on the roadside
 aspataal le jate samay naveen ne raste main hi dam tod diya
 The number of attackers was reported to be three to four
 vahiin, soochna milte hi jile ke tamaam aalaa adhikari ghatnasthal par pahunch gaye
 a team of forensic experts was also called to the scene
 lakhanu main soobe ke pramukh sachiv (soochna) avanish avasthi ne bataaya ki mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne is ghatana par dukh vyakt kiya he
 At the same time, Director General of Police Sulkhan Singh has been directed to get the case investigated soon and arrest the culprits
 avanish avasthi ne bataaya ki kanpur ke jiladhikari or varisht police adheekshak ko turant ghatnasthal par pahunchane ke nirdesh die gaye hai
 Police officials are yet to know the cause of the murder, but at first glance they find it a case of old enmity
 police adheekshak ne bataaya ki parivaar dwaara likhit shikaayat dene par maamla darj kiya jayega
 Meanwhile, the police have started a massive search operation, but no arrest has been made so far
 sthaneey patrakaron or patrkaar sanghathanon ne is hatyakand ke baad baithak bulaai or patrkaar kii hatya kii kadi ninda kii
 Kanpur Press Club president Avnish Dixit condemned the incident and said that if the killers of the journalist were not arrested within 24 hours, the journalists would agitate
 unhone patrkaar ke parijanon ko aarthik sahaayta dene kii bhi maang kii
 Recently, there were cases of murder of Gauri Lankesh and Sudeep Dutt Bhowmick in Tripura in Tripura
 isse bhi pehle june 2015 main uttar pradesh ke shahjahanpur main ek patrkaar jagendra singh kii jalaakarhatyakar di gai thi
 He was exposed to the mining mafia scandals
 iske alaava oktober 2015 main pradesh ke chandauli jile main 45 varshiya patrkaar hemanth yadav kii goli markar hatya kar di gai thi
 In August 2015, Sanjay Pathak (42), a Hindi daily working as a part-time correspondent in Bareilly, was also murdered
 unke sir par kisi baari vastu se prahaar kiya gaya tha
 This is the 20th issue of the University Series
 mujhe pataa he ki ab aapke liye jhelana mushkil ho gaya lekin yah series un lakhon naujavaanon ke liye he jo is system ko jhel rahe hai, jab yahi noujvaan kalejon se niklenge to samaaj or desh ko jhelana mushkil ho jayega
 The project is called the University System to undermine the edge of our national creativity and productivity
 bhartiya uniwarsity main guide bhale na mili magar guidelins zarur milegi
 Everyone has guidelines but no one has line length
 hindi main guideline ko dishanirdesh kehete hai
 Directions are issued but they do not appear in any direction
 ujisi ne ek guideline banane ke liye ki kitne chaatr par kitne shikshak hone chahie to iske liye ek cameti banaai
 The committee was formed under the chairmanship of JAK Taran
 16 march 2011 ko press information beuro kii press release main kaha gaya he ki tarin cameti ne suzav diya he ki snaatak, under graduate collejon main scince ke 25 chaatro par ek shikshak hoga
 Social Signs will have one teacher on 30 students
 piji scince main 10 chaatro par ek shikshak hoga
 PG Social Signs will have one teacher on 15 students
 yahi nahin Institutions of Eminence ke liye ujisi ne guideline banaai he
 This is what the Prime Minister mentioned about 100 years of Patna University that 10 private and 10 public universities will be made world class so that it can be ranked in 200 universities of the world
 ye ranking par bhi kabhi alag se baat karuunga
 There is a new kind of tingling
 baharhaal ujisi ne Institutions of Eminence ke liye jo guideline banaai he usamen saaf saaf likhaa he ki kisi santhaan ko pratishthit santhaan ghoshit karne kii adhisuchana jari karte samay 1 shikshak par 20 chaatr hi hone chahie or paanch saal main 10 chaatro par ek shikshak hona chahie
 If this is the case, then every college should have this ratio so that students can get better education
 kya uniwarsity yaa college main aane vaale chaatro ke paas yah soochna hoti he, kya unke us farm yaa broshar par likhaa hota he jise ve 1000 se 1500 rupee dekar kharidte hai, kya us par yah nahin likhaa hona chahie ki aapkaa yahaan swaagat he, ujisi ke hisaab se to har chaatro par ek shikshak hona chahie magar ham 300 se 400 chaatro par ek shikshak denge
 Is this the reason that when not understood in class, students get the speed of passing in the shelter of Rekha Guide, Jaspal Guide and Champion Guide
 yah mazaaq bharat ke yuvaaon ke saath hi ho saktaa he, unhen pataa nahin chalata kyonki ve kaan main year pis (eepi) daale letest sang sun rahe hote hai
 During this series we saw that there are 1900 students in Jayanarayan Lal Mohan Lal Purohit Government College, Phalodi, but there is not a single permanent teacher
 eskeem college, begusarai main 1200 chaatro par ek shikshak hai
 RK College, Madhubani has one teacher at 500
 jain college, aara main 180 chaatro par ek shikshak hai
 Maharaja College, Ara has a teacher at 270 students
 aapane chaatr or shikshak kaa anupaat dekh hi liya, sar peetane kii zarurat nahin he, is sankhya ke lihaaz se har college main shikshakon ke manzur padon kii sankhya bhi kai guna ho jaaegi or net pariksha paas karne vaale yogya ummidavaaron kii lottery khul jaaegi
 But there is another quality of unemployed people who have the ability to become teachers of India
 ve bhi nahin chaahate hai ki naukari mili
 i see many of them, Hindus spend more time in Muslim, less talk on job and employment prospects
 bihar ke begusarai kaa ek college shrikrishna mahila college main saadhe das hazaar chatraayen padhati hai magar yahaan shikshakon ke liye manjuur padon kii sankhya maatr tees he
 While there should be 350
 is tees main se bhi 9 hi lekturer professor hai
 Think how serious the situation is, you say the university has become cumbersome
 hamaare sahyogi syed meraaj ne bihar ke aara ke jain college ke bare main jo soochna bheji he, use sunakar aap das puri zyaada kha lenge
 Sitting in the corridor of Jain College Ara, these children are studying in groups
 compatishan kii taiyaari kar apana rasta khud khoj rahe hai
 In Ara you will find students studying in the same way among the ruins of the college
 is tasviir ko dekh kar aap kah sakate hai ki inamen padhane kii ichha main koi kami nahin he lekin inaki pratibha railway ke imtahaan paas kar lene tak hi simit rah jaati he
 If these promising students had got an opportunity, if they had got qualified teachers, what could they not have done
 sarkaron ne inke sapane kuchal die
 By dividing them into caste and religion, they have become incomplete
 1918 main harprasad das jain ne adinath trust kii sthapana kii thi or aara nagar main ucch shiksha ke prasar hetu ek mahavidhyalay kii sthapana kii ichha vyakt kii
 In 1919, 60,000 rupees were also donated for this work, think of the year 1919 and 60,000 rupees to spread higher education in Ara
 unke jivan main college nahin ban sakaa to 1942 main adinath trust ne phir se 1 lakh 55 hazaar rupaya daan diya
 Our governments have also killed the dreams of Harprasad Jain
 galaa ghont diya he
 In 1945, Dumraon Maharaj Shri Ram Ranvijay Prasad gave 21 bigha 10 katha land near Ara railway station
 aap dilli se patna rail se jaaenge to baayin taraf jain college aara dikhataa he
 But how many know that the dreams of becoming this college were murdered by our leaders
 isamen kul 17 vibhaag he jisamen intermidiet se lekar piji tak kii padhai hoti he
 The total number of teachers in this should be 132 while there are only 65
 ek sawaal baar baar uthta he ki jahaan teacher kii sankhya itani kam he un collejon ko grad kaise mil jaataa he
 Does Naik's grading make any sense? Some buildings at Jain College Ara were painted three times under the guise of Naik's team
 aakhir jahaan 132 shikshak hone chahie, 65 hi hai to phir use koi bhi grading kis chiz kii di ja rahi he, kya aara ke naujavaanon ko jhansa dene ke liye ki ise bi grad hasil he aap yahaan admician lete rahiye or phir class kii jagah baraamde main mundi gaadkar railway guard kii taiyaari karte rahiye
 The Indian government should investigate the NAC system only to see what is happening
 nack kii team har jagah jane or grad dene ke liye fees leti he college se
 Eleven and a half thousand children study in Jain College Ara
 is sankhya ke hisaab se yahaan shikshakon ke liye manzur padon kii sankhya 350 se 400 ke bich honi chahie lekin manzur padon kii sankhya 132 hi he
 Out of this 132, 65 are teachers
 yahaan ke puraane principal ne college ko kaaphi barbaad kiya lekin jo nae aaen hai wo kaaphi prayaas kar rahe hai jiskaa koi nateeja nahin he
 The principal has given in writing that there is a huge shortage of teachers here
 aap jaanate hi hai ki bharat main kisi samasya ko likhit main de dena kitni badi baat hoti he
 There is an open urinal at the eastern gate of Jain College Ara
 college main shauchalay kaa itnaa bura haal he ki shikshakon ko ghar janaa padataa tha, darasal aap samaj hi sakate honge ki ve bhi aise kisi purvi get kaa hi sahaara le lete honge
 Teachers told that before the arrival of new principal, you cannot even use the college toilets, they have paid attention to cleanliness
 principal sahab samaj gaye hai ki shikshakon kii bhartee unke bas kii baat nahin he isliye unhen biometric system par hi sahaara he taaki jo nahin aate hai wo to aane lag jaaen
 a story of Jain College Ara's toilet is revealed
 yahaan ladakiyon ke liye shauchalay nahin he jabaki yahaan paanch se chah hazaar ladkiyaan padhati hai
 The girls' common room has one toilet room with four toilets
 ladakiyon ke liye alag se ek shauchalay or bana tha lekin wo do dhai saal se band tha
 When the college opened the toilet to prepare for the reception of Naik's team, it had boys' urinals in it
 aisa ghotaalaa or kahaan ho saktaa he
 The toilet was again closed so that the college would not be in disrepute
 aap sochie paanch hazaar ladakiyon par kul paanch shauchalay hai
 While 6 girls should have a toilet
 kya is sthiti main chatraayen college aati hongi
 The Union Minister of State for Home Affairs is Rajkumar Singh Ara's MP
 magar yah samajhnaa hoga ki is samasya ko bees pachis saal se paala posa ja rahaa he
 After all, why Ara, which is such an energetic city, could not manage a college of its own
 phir aara zila ghar ba, koun baat ke dar ba kehane kaa kya matlab he
 What was the result of that courage for the city
 maharaja college pehle jaj sahab kii kothi ke naam se mashhoor thi
 Maharaj Kamal Singh of Dumraon donated 25 bighas of land for the college in memory of his father
 isaki kuch imaaraten rangi puti hai
 But inside this college is also a perfect example of India's lowest status of higher education
 yahaan das hazaar chaatr padhate hai
 i was surprised to hear that 2500 students study in history subject from Inter to PG
 kisi ko pataa lagaana chahie ki yahaan itihaas itnaa lokapriy kyon he, kya shikshak kamaal ke hai yaa phir chaatro ko pataa he ki bhavishya to barbaad ho chukaa he to kyon na jite jite ji itihaas ban jaaen
 This college has only one permanent teacher in the entire college to teach history to 2500 students
 kya aapako ab bhi uniwarsity series boring lag rahi he
 Here, 2500 students from Inter to PG are studying history as a permanent teacher
 teen asthaayee shikshak hai jinhen vetan nahin miltaa he
 Since 1997, these teachers have not received money

 If no one gets money since 1997, why is he teaching or why is he teaching, has the system taken away the right to be a human being by giving hope of a job

 Doesn't your heart burst when you see this, that there are one teacher on 2500 students
 maharaja college main 82 pad manzur hai magar 37 shikshak hi hai
 If we look at the number of students, then the number of sanctioned posts of teachers should be 300 to 400, but there is a mismatch in sanctioned posts as well
 aap is chaatr ko suniye or sochie ki hamaari uniwarsity system ne naujavaanon kii kya haalat kar di he
 Both these colleges come under Bir Kunwar Singh University

 Is it not too much that a student should not be allowed to come to college, to be given such a huge punishment for performing, then to whom the student should be punished for colleges which are not teachers

 There is a shortage of professors and assistant professors
 lab kii haalat bahut kharaab he
 Looking at this lab, you will not feel that it belongs to any university

 According to a news report by Amar Ujala, the Vice Chancellor himself has complained to the Governor about a massive scam in Narendra Dev Agricultural University
 rajyapal se jab yah sawaal poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki koi shikaayat nahin mili he
 It is printed in Amar Ujala

 In the 18th issue of the University Series, we showed how the Lalmatiya Adivasi Inter College in Godda is on the verge of falling
 is kalege ke thik neeche koyala mafia ne surang banaakar koyala nikaal liya he jiske kaaran college kii buniyaad kamazor ho gai he
 The water level has disappeared
 college kabhi bhi bharbhara kar gir saktaa he
 Students also face pollution due to the explosion in the nearby mine
 chaatr yahaan aate hai to magar haaziri banaakar bhaag jate hai, is dar se ki kahin imaarat na gir jaae
 This has happened in our story that small politics has started happening
 6 november ko lohadia kaali mandir main is college ke chaatro kii ek panchayat hui jisamen congress kii zila adhyaksh deepika pandeya singh pahunchi
 The idea was that this college would be demanded for the building and land
 chaatr panchayat main mata pita bhi aae the
 Questions also arose about the role of the principal
 yahaan chaatro ne wo baat bhi bataai jiskaa pataa hamen nahin tha
 He said that before taking scholarship, one has to pay bribe
 deepika ne godda ke kamishnar ko patr bhi diya he
 Leaders should know in advance about such a college
 yah nahin ki tivi main aayaa to pradarshan karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaye
 BJP MP Nand Shikant Dubey has spoken to ECL officials and raised the issue
 yahi nahin Institutions of Eminence ke liye ujisi ne guideline banaai he
 This is what the Prime Minister mentioned about 100 years of Patna University that 10 private and 10 public universities will be made world class so that it can be ranked in 200 universities of the world
 ye ranking par bhi kabhi alag se baat karuunga
 There is a new kind of tingling
 baharhaal ujisi ne Institutions of Eminence ke liye jo guideline banaai he usamen saaf saaf likhaa he ki kisi santhaan ko pratishthit santhaan ghoshit karne kii adhisuchana jari karte samay 1 shikshak par 20 chaatr hi hone chahie or paanch saal main 10 chaatro par ek shikshak hona chahie
 If this is the case, then every college should have this ratio so that students can get better education
 kya uniwarsity yaa college main aane vaale chaatro ke paas yah soochna hoti he, kya unke us farm yaa broshar par likhaa hota he jise ve 1000 se 1500 rupee dekar kharidte hai, kya us par yah nahin likhaa hona chahie ki aapkaa yahaan swaagat he, ujisi ke hisaab se to har chaatro par ek shikshak hona chahie magar ham 300 se 400 chaatro par ek shikshak denge
 Is this the reason that when not understood in class, students get the speed of passing in the shelter of Rekha Guide, Jaspal Guide and Champion Guide
 yah mazaaq bharat ke yuvaaon ke saath hi ho saktaa he, unhen pataa nahin chalata kyonki ve kaan main year pis (eepi) daale letest sang sun rahe hote hai
 During this series we saw that there are 1900 students in Jayanarayan Lal Mohan Lal Purohit Government College, Phalodi, but there is not a single permanent teacher
 eskeem college, begusarai main 1200 chaatro par ek shikshak hai
 RK College, Madhubani has one teacher at 500
 jain college, aara main 180 chaatro par ek shikshak hai
 Maharaja College, Ara has a teacher at 270 students
 aapane chaatr or shikshak kaa anupaat dekh hi liya, sar peetane kii zarurat nahin he, is sankhya ke lihaaz se har college main shikshakon ke manzur padon kii sankhya bhi kai guna ho jaaegi or net pariksha paas karne vaale yogya ummidavaaron kii lottery khul jaaegi
 But there is another quality of unemployed people who have the ability to become teachers of India
 ve bhi nahin chaahate hai ki naukari mili
 i see many of them, Hindus spend more time in Muslim, less talk on job and employment prospects
 bihar ke begusarai kaa ek college shrikrishna mahila college main saadhe das hazaar chatraayen padhati hai magar yahaan shikshakon ke liye manjuur padon kii sankhya maatr tees he
 While there should be 350
 is tees main se bhi 9 hi lekturer professor hai
 Think how serious the situation is, you say the university has become cumbersome
 hamaare sahyogi syed meraaj ne bihar ke aara ke jain college ke bare main jo soochna bheji he, use sunakar aap das puri zyaada kha lenge
 Sitting in the corridor of Jain College Ara, these children are studying in groups
 compatishan kii taiyaari kar apana rasta khud khoj rahe hai
 In Ara you will find students studying in the same way among the ruins of the college
 is tasviir ko dekh kar aap kah sakate hai ki inamen padhane kii ichha main koi kami nahin he lekin inaki pratibha railway ke imtahaan paas kar lene tak hi simit rah jaati he
 If these promising students had got an opportunity, if they had got qualified teachers, what could they not have done
 sarkaron ne inke sapane kuchal die
 By dividing them into caste and religion, they have become incomplete
 1918 main harprasad das jain ne adinath trust kii sthapana kii thi or aara nagar main ucch shiksha ke prasar hetu ek mahavidhyalay kii sthapana kii ichha vyakt kii
 In 1919, 60,000 rupees were also donated for this work, think of the year 1919 and 60,000 rupees to spread higher education in Ara
 unke jivan main college nahin ban sakaa to 1942 main adinath trust ne phir se 1 lakh 55 hazaar rupaya daan diya
 Our governments have also killed the dreams of Harprasad Jain
 galaa ghont diya he
 In 1945, Dumraon Maharaj Shri Ram Ranvijay Prasad gave 21 bigha 10 katha land near Ara railway station
 aap dilli se patna rail se jaaenge to baayin taraf jain college aara dikhataa he
 But how many know that the dreams of becoming this college were murdered by our leaders
 isamen kul 17 vibhaag he jisamen intermidiet se lekar piji tak kii padhai hoti he
 The total number of teachers in this should be 132 while there are only 65
 ek sawaal baar baar uthta he ki jahaan teacher kii sankhya itani kam he un collejon ko grad kaise mil jaataa he
 Does Naik's grading make any sense? Some buildings at Jain College Ara were painted three times under the guise of Naik's team
 aakhir jahaan 132 shikshak hone chahie, 65 hi hai to phir use koi bhi grading kis chiz kii di ja rahi he, kya aara ke naujavaanon ko jhansa dene ke liye ki ise bi grad hasil he aap yahaan admician lete rahiye or phir class kii jagah baraamde main mundi gaadkar railway guard kii taiyaari karte rahiye
 The Indian government should investigate the NAC system only to see what is happening
 nack kii team har jagah jane or grad dene ke liye fees leti he college se
 Eleven and a half thousand children study in Jain College Ara
 is sankhya ke hisaab se yahaan shikshakon ke liye manzur padon kii sankhya 350 se 400 ke bich honi chahie lekin manzur padon kii sankhya 132 hi he
 Out of this 132, 65 are teachers
 yahaan ke puraane principal ne college ko kaaphi barbaad kiya lekin jo nae aaen hai wo kaaphi prayaas kar rahe hai jiskaa koi nateeja nahin he
 The principal has given in writing that there is a huge shortage of teachers here
 aap jaanate hi hai ki bharat main kisi samasya ko likhit main de dena kitni badi baat hoti he
 There is an open urinal at the eastern gate of Jain College Ara
 college main shauchalay kaa itnaa bura haal he ki shikshakon ko ghar janaa padataa tha, darasal aap samaj hi sakate honge ki ve bhi aise kisi purvi get kaa hi sahaara le lete honge
 Teachers told that before the arrival of new principal, you cannot even use the college toilets, they have paid attention to cleanliness
 principal sahab samaj gaye hai ki shikshakon kii bhartee unke bas kii baat nahin he isliye unhen biometric system par hi sahaara he taaki jo nahin aate hai wo to aane lag jaaen
 a story of Jain College Ara's toilet is revealed
 yahaan ladakiyon ke liye shauchalay nahin he jabaki yahaan paanch se chah hazaar ladkiyaan padhati hai
 The girls' common room has one toilet room with four toilets
 ladakiyon ke liye alag se ek shauchalay or bana tha lekin wo do dhai saal se band tha
 When the college opened the toilet to prepare for the reception of Naik's team, it had boys' urinals in it
 aisa ghotaalaa or kahaan ho saktaa he
 The toilet was again closed so that the college would not be in disrepute
 aap sochie paanch hazaar ladakiyon par kul paanch shauchalay hai
 While 6 girls should have a toilet
 kya is sthiti main chatraayen college aati hongi
 The Union Minister of State for Home Affairs is Rajkumar Singh Ara's MP
 magar yah samajhnaa hoga ki is samasya ko bees pachis saal se paala posa ja rahaa he
 After all, why Ara, which is such an energetic city, could not manage a college of its own
 phir aara zila ghar ba, koun baat ke dar ba kehane kaa kya matlab he
 What was the result of that courage for the city
 maharaja college pehle jaj sahab kii kothi ke naam se mashhoor thi
 Maharaj Kamal Singh of Dumraon donated 25 bighas of land for the college in memory of his father
 isaki kuch imaaraten rangi puti hai
 But inside this college is also a perfect example of India's lowest status of higher education
 yahaan das hazaar chaatr padhate hai
 i was surprised to hear that 2500 students study in history subject from Inter to PG
 kisi ko pataa lagaana chahie ki yahaan itihaas itnaa lokapriy kyon he, kya shikshak kamaal ke hai yaa phir chaatro ko pataa he ki bhavishya to barbaad ho chukaa he to kyon na jite jite ji itihaas ban jaaen
 This college has only one permanent teacher in the entire college to teach history to 2500 students
 kya aapako ab bhi uniwarsity series boring lag rahi he
 Here, 2500 students from Inter to PG are studying history as a permanent teacher
 teen asthaayee shikshak hai jinhen vetan nahin miltaa he
 Since 1997, these teachers have not received money
 yah sab sunate hue aapako kya lag rahaa he, aap nayaa india main he yaa gaya india main hai
 If no one gets money since 1997, why is he teaching or why is he teaching, has the system taken away the right to be a human being by giving hope of a job
 750 chaatr physics onors main he or 4 shikshak hi hai
 Doesn't your heart burst when you see this, that there are one teacher on 2500 students
 maharaja college main 82 pad manzur hai magar 37 shikshak hi hai
 If we look at the number of students, then the number of sanctioned posts of teachers should be 300 to 400, but there is a mismatch in sanctioned posts as well
 aap is chaatr ko suniye or sochie ki hamaari uniwarsity system ne naujavaanon kii kya haalat kar di he

 BJP MP Nishikant Dubey has spoken to ECL officials and raised the issue
 agar ye baat he tab to phir har college main yah anupaat hona chahie taaki chaatro ko behatar shiksha mil sake
 Do students coming to university or college have this information, is it written on their form or brochure which they buy by paying 1000 to 1500 rupees, should it not be written that you are welcome here, UGC According to this, there should be one teacher for every student, but we will give one teacher for 300 to 400 students
 kya yahi kaaran he ki class main samaj nahin aane par chaatr rekha guide, jasapaal guide or champion guide kii sharan main jaakar paas hone kii gati praapt karte hai
 This joke can only happen to the youth of India, they do not know because they are listening to the latest song put ear piece (EP) in their ears
 hamane is series ke dauraan dekha ki jainarayan laal mohan laal purohit rajkeey mahavidhyalay, falaudi main 1900 chaatr hai magar ek bhi permanent teacher nahin hai
 SKM College, Begusarai has a teacher at 1200 students
 aar ke college, madhubani main 500 par ek shikshak hai
 Jain College, Ara has one teacher on 180 students
 maharaja college, aara main 270 chaatro par ek shikshak hai
 You have seen the ratio of student to teacher, there is no need to beat the head, in terms of this number, the number of sanctioned posts of teachers in every college will also multiply and the lottery will open for the qualified candidates who pass the NET exam
 magar bharat ke shikshak banane kii yogyata rakhane vaale berojgaaron kii ek or khubi he
 They also do not want to get a job
 unamem se bhi kaiyon ko main dekhtaa hum, zyada samay hindu muslim main lage rahete hai, naukari or rojgaar kii sambhaavna par kam baat karte hai
 In Srikrishna Mahila College, a college in Begusarai, Bihar, ten and a half thousand students study, but there are only thirty sanctioned posts for teachers
 jabaki hona chahie 350
 Only 9 out of this thirty are lecturer professors
 sochie halaat kitne gambhir hai, aap kehete hai uniwarsity bojhil ho chukaa he
 Hearing the information that our colleague Syed Meraz has sent about the Jain College of Ara in Bihar, you will eat ten puris more
 jain college aara ke galiyare main baithe ye bachche group banaakar padhai kar rahe hai
 Preparing for competition, finding our own way
 aara main aapako college ke khandhiron ke bich isi tarah chaatr samooh main padhate mil jaaenge
 Looking at this picture, you can say that there is no lack in the desire to read them, but their talent is limited to pass the examination of the railway
 agar in honhaar chaatro ko mauka mila hota, yogya shikshak mili hote to ye kya nahin kar sakate the
 Governments crushed their dreams
 inhen jati or dharm main baant kar adhamra kar diya he
 In 1918 Harprasad Das Jain founded the Adinath Trust and expressed his desire to establish a college for the promotion of higher education in Ara Nagar
 1919 main is kaam ke liye 60,000 rupee daan main bhi die, sochie saal 1919 or rupaya 60,000 taaki aara main ucch shiksha kaa prasar ho
 If the college could not be formed in his life, then in 1942 the Adinath Trust again donated 1 lakh 55 thousand rupees
 hamaari sarkaron ne harprasad jain ji ke sapanom kii bhi hatya kar di he
 Is strangled
 1945 main dumraanv maharaj shri ram ranvijay prasad ne aara railway stesan ke paas 21 bighaa 10 kaththa jameen di
 If you go from Delhi to Patna by train, Jain College Ara is seen on the left side
 lekin kitnon ko pataa he ki is college ke banane ke sapanom ko hamaare netaaon ne hatya kar di
 There are a total of 17 departments in which studies from intermediate to PG
 isamen shikshakon kii kul sankhya 132 honi chahie jabaki maatr 65 hai
 a question arises again and again, how do those colleges get grades where the number of teachers is so low
 kya nack kii grading kaa koi matlab he, jain college aara kii kuch imaaraton ko nack kii team ke chakkar main teen teen baar rangana potna pad gaya
 After all, where there should be 132 teachers, 65 are there, then what is any grading being given to it, to keep the youth of Ara from pretending that it has a b grade, keep taking admission here and then instead of class corridor Keep preparing for railway guard by hitting Mundi
 bharat sarkaar ko nack system kii hi jaanch kerani chahie ki yah sab ho kya rahaa he
 Naik's team charges college for going everywhere and giving grades
 jain college aara main saadhe gyaarah hazaar bachche padhate hai
 According to this number, the number of sanctioned posts for teachers here should be between 350 and 400 but the number of sanctioned posts is only 132
 is 132 main se 65 shikshak hi hai
 The old principal here ruined the college a lot, but the newcomers who are coming here are trying a lot which has no result
 praachaarya ne likhit main diya he ki yahaan shikshak kii baari kami he
 You know how big a problem it is to give a problem in writing in India
 jain college aara ke purvi get par open mutralay he
 The toilet in the college is in such a bad condition that the teachers had to go home, in fact you must have understood that they too would have resorted to any such eastern gate
 shikshakon ne bataaya ki nae principal ke aane ke pehle to aap college ke shauchalay kaa istemaal bhi nahin kar sakate hai, unhone saaf safai par dhyaan diya he
 Principal sir has understood that the recruitment of teachers is not just about him, so he has recourse on the biometric system so that those who do not come can start coming
 jain college aara ke shauchalay kii ek kahani pataa chali he
 There are no toilets for girls, whereas five to six thousand girls study here
 ladakiyon ke kaaman room main shauchalay ke liye ek hi cameraa he jisamen chaar paanch shauchalay hai
 a separate toilet was made for girls but it was closed for two and a half years
 nack kii team ke swaagat kii taiyaari ke liye jab college ne us shauchalay ko kholaa to usamen ladakon ke urinal lage the
 Where else can such a scam happen
 phir se us shauchalay ko band kar diya gaya taaki college kii badanaami na ho
 Think about five toilets for five thousand girls
 jabaki 6 ladakiyon par ek shauchalay hona chahie
 Will the students come to college in this situation
 kendriya grih rajya mantri rajkumaar singh aara ke hi saansad hai
 But it has to be understood that this problem is being brought up for twenty-five years
 aakhir aara jo ki itnaa urjavan shahar he apane ek college ko kyon nahin sambhaal sakaa
 Then what is the meaning of saying that the Ara district is home, who is afraid of what? us saahas kaa kya fal mila shahar ko
 The Maharaja College was earlier known as Judge Sahi's Kothi
 dumraanv ke maharaj camel singh ne apane pita kii yaad main college ke liye 25 bigha zamin daan main di thi
 Some of its buildings are colored paint
 magar andar ye yah college bhi bharat kii ucch shiksha kii nimnatam sthiti kaa adarsh udhaaharan he
 Ten thousand students study here
 main to sunakar hairaan rah gaya ki yahaan inter se piji tak itihaas vishay main 2500 chaatr padhate hai
 One must find out why history is so popular here, whether the teachers are amazing or the students know that the future is ruined, so why not live it and become history
 2500 chaatro ko itihaas padhaane ke liye is college main puure college main ek hi sthaayee shikshak he
 Do you still find the university series boring? yahaan par ek sthaayee shikshak ke bharose inter se piji ke 2500 chaatr itihaas pard rahe hai
 There are three temporary teachers who do not receive salary

 The name of freedom fighter and socialist leader Acharya Narendra Dev is still taken in UP politics but the condition of agricultural university named after him is also bad
 tippaniyan In 1975, the buildings of Acharya Narendra Dev Agriculture University looked fine from outside
 shaayad hamaare dekhne kaa yahi nazariyaa ho gaya he ki building or campus thik he to college yaa uniwarsity thik hogi
 But when our colleague Pramod Shrivastava went here, it came to know that there should have been 42 head of the department but there are only 32
 professor or assistant professor kii kami he
 The condition of the lab is very poor
 is lab ko dekh kar nahin lagegaa ki kisi uniwarsity kaa he
 The students said that the toilet in their hostel is very dirty

 When the students come here, they run away with attendance, fearing that the building may collapse
 hamaari story kaa yahi hua he ki choti moti raajnneeti hone lagi he
 On 6 November, a Panchayat of students of this college held in Lohria Kali temple, in which Congress district president Deepika Pandey Singh arrived
 vichaar hua ki is is college ko kii imaarat or zamin ke liye maang kii jaaegi
 Parents also came to the student panchayat
 principal kii bhoomika ko lekar bhi sawaal uthe
 Here the students also told us what we did not know
 unhone kaha ki scolership lene se pehle rishwat deni padati he
 Deepika has also given a letter to the commissioner of Godda

 You have seen the ratio of student to teacher, there is no need to beat the head, in terms of this number, the number of sanctioned posts of teachers in every college will also multiply and the lottery will open for the qualified candidates who pass the NET exam
 magar bharat ke shikshak banane kii yogyata rakhane vaale berojgaaron kii ek or khubi he
 They also do not want to get a job
 unamem se bhi kaiyon ko main dekhtaa hum, zyada samay hindu muslim main lage rahete hai, naukari or rojgaar kii sambhaavna par kam baat karte hai
 In Srikrishna Mahila College, a college in Begusarai, Bihar, ten and a half thousand students study, but there are only thirty sanctioned posts for teachers
 jabaki hona chahie 350
 Only 9 out of this thirty are lecturer professors
 sochie halaat kitne gambhir hai, aap kehete hai uniwarsity bojhil ho chukaa he
 Hearing the information that our colleague Syed Meraz has sent about the Jain College of Ara in Bihar, you will eat ten puris more
 jain college aara ke galiyare main baithe ye bachche group banaakar padhai kar rahe hai
 Preparing for competition, finding our own way
 aara main aapako college ke khandhiron ke bich isi tarah chaatr samooh main padhate mil jaaenge
 Looking at this picture, you can say that there is no lack in the desire to read them, but their talent is limited to pass the examination of the railway
 agar in honhaar chaatro ko mauka mila hota, yogya shikshak mili hote to ye kya nahin kar sakate the
 Governments crushed their dreams
 inhen jati or dharm main baant kar adhamra kar diya he
 In 1918 Harprasad Das Jain founded the Adinath Trust and expressed his desire to establish a college for the promotion of higher education in Ara Nagar
 1919 main is kaam ke liye 60,000 rupee daan main bhi die, sochie saal 1919 or rupaya 60,000 taaki aara main ucch shiksha kaa prasar ho
 If the college could not be formed in his life, then in 1942 the Adinath Trust again donated 1 lakh 55 thousand rupees
 hamaari sarkaron ne harprasad jain ji ke sapanom kii bhi hatya kar di he
 Is strangled
 1945 main dumraanv maharaj shri ram ranvijay prasad ne aara railway stesan ke paas 21 bighaa 10 kaththa jameen di
 If you go from Delhi to Patna by train, Jain College Ara is seen on the left side
 lekin kitnon ko pataa he ki is college ke banane ke sapanom ko hamaare netaaon ne hatya kar di
 There are a total of 17 departments in which studies from intermediate to PG
 isamen shikshakon kii kul sankhya 132 honi chahie jabaki maatr 65 hai
 a question arises again and again, how do those colleges get grades where the number of teachers is so low
 kya nack kii grading kaa koi matlab he, jain college aara kii kuch imaaraton ko nack kii team ke chakkar main teen teen baar rangana potna pad gaya
 After all, where there should be 132 teachers, 65 are there, then what is any grading being given to it, to keep the youth of Ara from pretending that it has a b grade, keep taking admission here and then instead of class corridor Keep preparing for railway guard by hitting Mundi
 bharat sarkaar ko nack system kii hi jaanch kerani chahie ki yah sab ho kya rahaa he
 Naik's team charges college for going everywhere and giving grades
 jain college aara main saadhe gyaarah hazaar bachche padhate hai
 According to this number, the number of sanctioned posts for teachers here should be between 350 and 400 but the number of sanctioned posts is only 132
 is 132 main se 65 shikshak hi hai
 The old principal here ruined the college a lot, but the newcomers who are coming here are trying a lot which has no result
 praachaarya ne likhit main diya he ki yahaan shikshak kii baari kami he
 You know how big a problem it is to give a problem in writing in India
 jain college aara ke purvi get par open mutralay he
 The toilet in the college is in such a bad condition that the teachers had to go home, in fact you must have understood that they too would have resorted to any such eastern gate
 shikshakon ne bataaya ki nae principal ke aane ke pehle to aap college ke shauchalay kaa istemaal bhi nahin kar sakate hai, unhone saaf safai par dhyaan diya he
 Principal sir has understood that the recruitment of teachers is not just about him, so he has recourse on the biometric system so that those who do not come can start coming
 jain college aara ke shauchalay kii ek kahani pataa chali he
 There are no toilets for girls, whereas five to six thousand girls study here
 ladakiyon ke kaaman room main shauchalay ke liye ek hi cameraa he jisamen chaar paanch shauchalay hai
 a separate toilet was made for girls but it was closed for two and a half years
 nack kii team ke swaagat kii taiyaari ke liye jab college ne us shauchalay ko kholaa to usamen ladakon ke urinal lage the
 Where else can such a scam happen
 phir se us shauchalay ko band kar diya gaya taaki college kii badanaami na ho
 Think about five toilets for five thousand girls
 jabaki 6 ladakiyon par ek shauchalay hona chahie
 Will the students come to college in this situation
 kendriya grih rajya mantri rajkumaar singh aara ke hi saansad hai
 But it has to be understood that this problem is being brought up for twenty-five years
 aakhir aara jo ki itnaa urjavan shahar he apane ek college ko kyon nahin sambhaal sakaa
 Then what is the meaning of saying that the Ara district is home, who is afraid of what? us saahas kaa kya fal mila shahar ko
 The Maharaja College was earlier known as Judge Sahi's Kothi
 dumraanv ke maharaj camel singh ne apane pita kii yaad main college ke liye 25 bigha zamin daan main di thi
 Some of its buildings are colored paint
 magar andar ye yah college bhi bharat kii ucch shiksha kii nimnatam sthiti kaa adarsh udhaaharan he
 Ten thousand students study here
 main to sunakar hairaan rah gaya ki yahaan inter se piji tak itihaas vishay main 2500 chaatr padhate hai
 One must find out why history is so popular here, whether the teachers are amazing or the students know that the future is ruined, so why not live it and become history
 2500 chaatro ko itihaas padhaane ke liye is college main puure college main ek hi sthaayee shikshak he
 Do you still find the university series boring? yahaan par ek sthaayee shikshak ke bharose inter se piji ke 2500 chaatr itihaas pard rahe hai
 There are three temporary teachers who do not receive salary
 1997 se in shikshakon ko paisa nahin mila he
 Hearing all this, how do you feel, are you in Naya India or are you in Gaya India
 1997 se kisi ko paisa na mili to wo kyon padhaaye yaa kyon padhaa rahaa he, kya system ne naukari kii ummid dekar insaan se insaan hone kaa haq chin liya he

 If these promising students had got an opportunity, if they had got qualified teachers, what could they not have done

 By dividing them into caste and religion, they have become incomplete
 1918 main harprasad das jain ne adinath trust kii sthapana kii thi or aara nagar main ucch shiksha ke prasar hetu ek mahavidhyalay kii sthapana kii ichha vyakt kii
 In 1919, 60,000 rupees were also donated for this work, think of the year 1919 and 60,000 rupees to spread higher education in Ara
 unke jivan main college nahin ban sakaa to 1942 main adinath trust ne phir se 1 lakh 55 hazaar rupaya daan diya
 Our governments have also killed the dreams of Harprasad Jain

 In 1945, Dumraon Maharaj Shri Ram Ranvijay Prasad gave 21 bigha 10 katha land near Ara railway station

 But how many know that the dreams of becoming this college were murdered by our leaders
 isamen kul 17 vibhaag he jisamen intermidiet se lekar piji tak kii padhai hoti he
 The total number of teachers in this should be 132 while there are only 65
 ek sawaal baar baar uthta he ki jahaan teacher kii sankhya itani kam he un collejon ko grad kaise mil jaataa he
 Does Naik's grading make any sense? Some buildings at Jain College Ara were painted three times under the guise of Naik's team
 aakhir jahaan 132 shikshak hone chahie, 65 hi hai to phir use koi bhi grading kis chiz kii di ja rahi he, kya aara ke naujavaanon ko jhansa dene ke liye ki ise bi grad hasil he aap yahaan admician lete rahiye or phir class kii jagah baraamde main mundi gaadkar railway guard kii taiyaari karte rahiye
 The Indian government should investigate the NAC system only to see what is happening
 nack kii team har jagah jane or grad dene ke liye fees leti he college se
 Eleven and a half thousand children study in Jain College Ara
 is sankhya ke hisaab se yahaan shikshakon ke liye manzur padon kii sankhya 350 se 400 ke bich honi chahie lekin manzur padon kii sankhya 132 hi he
 Out of this 132, 65 are teachers
 yahaan ke puraane principal ne college ko kaaphi barbaad kiya lekin jo nae aaen hai wo kaaphi prayaas kar rahe hai jiskaa koi nateeja nahin he
 The principal has given in writing that there is a huge shortage of teachers here
 aap jaanate hi hai ki bharat main kisi samasya ko likhit main de dena kitni badi baat hoti he
 There is an open urinal at the eastern gate of Jain College Ara
 college main shauchalay kaa itnaa bura haal he ki shikshakon ko ghar janaa padataa tha, darasal aap samaj hi sakate honge ki ve bhi aise kisi purvi get kaa hi sahaara le lete honge
 Teachers told that before the arrival of new principal, you cannot even use the college toilets, they have paid attention to cleanliness
 principal sahab samaj gaye hai ki shikshakon kii bhartee unke bas kii baat nahin he isliye unhen biometric system par hi sahaara he taaki jo nahin aate hai wo to aane lag jaaen
 a story of Jain College Ara's toilet is revealed
 yahaan ladakiyon ke liye shauchalay nahin he jabaki yahaan paanch se chah hazaar ladkiyaan padhati hai
 The girls' common room has one toilet room with four toilets
 ladakiyon ke liye alag se ek shauchalay or bana tha lekin wo do dhai saal se band tha
 When the college opened the toilet to prepare for the reception of Naik's team, it had boys' urinals in it
 aisa ghotaalaa or kahaan ho saktaa he
 The toilet was again closed so that the college would not be in disrepute
 aap sochie paanch hazaar ladakiyon par kul paanch shauchalay hai
 While 6 girls should have a toilet
 kya is sthiti main chatraayen college aati hongi
 The Union Minister of State for Home Affairs is Rajkumar Singh Ara's MP
 magar yah samajhnaa hoga ki is samasya ko bees pachis saal se paala posa ja rahaa he
 After all, why Ara, which is such an energetic city, could not manage a college of its own
 phir aara zila ghar ba, koun baat ke dar ba kehane kaa kya matlab he
 What was the result of that courage for the city
 maharaja college pehle jaj sahab kii kothi ke naam se mashhoor thi
 Maharaj Kamal Singh of Dumraon donated 25 bighas of land for the college in memory of his father
 isaki kuch imaaraten rangi puti hai
 But inside this college is also a perfect example of India's lowest status of higher education
 yahaan das hazaar chaatr padhate hai
 i was surprised to hear that 2500 students study in history subject from Inter to PG
 kisi ko pataa lagaana chahie ki yahaan itihaas itnaa lokapriy kyon he, kya shikshak kamaal ke hai yaa phir chaatro ko pataa he ki bhavishya to barbaad ho chukaa he to kyon na jite jite ji itihaas ban jaaen
 This college has only one permanent teacher in the entire college to teach history to 2500 students
 kya aapako ab bhi uniwarsity series boring lag rahi he
 Here, 2500 students from Inter to PG are studying history as a permanent teacher
 teen asthaayee shikshak hai jinhen vetan nahin miltaa he
 Since 1997, these teachers have not received money
 yah sab sunate hue aapako kya lag rahaa he, aap nayaa india main he yaa gaya india main hai
 If no one gets money since 1997, why is he teaching or why is he teaching, has the system taken away the right to be a human being by giving hope of a job
 750 chaatr physics onors main he or 4 shikshak hi hai
 Doesn't your heart burst when you see this, that there are one teacher on 2500 students
 maharaja college main 82 pad manzur hai magar 37 shikshak hi hai
 If we look at the number of students, then the number of sanctioned posts of teachers should be 300 to 400, but there is a mismatch in sanctioned posts as well
 aap is chaatr ko suniye or sochie ki hamaari uniwarsity system ne naujavaanon kii kya haalat kar di he
 Both these colleges come under Bir Kunwar Singh University
 bir kunwar singh kii jayanti pad jaae to sab mantri car lekar pahunch jaaenge or unka vaaris bataane lagenge magar unke naam par bani uniwarsity kii ye haalat he
 Employees are saying that they have moved from APL to BPL
 sarkaron ne collejon kii taraf dhyaan dena band kar diya he
 No leader wants to debate higher education because it cannot be cured now
 karmchaariyon kii maangen teen sutri se shuru kar gyaarah sutri, solah sutri ho gai hai
 The dharnas have been ineffective from time to time

 The VC promised to accept all the demands but retracted from the student union elections
 chaatr ad gaye to 50 se 60 andolankaaree chaatro ko 15 dinon ke liye resticket kar diya gaya
 In March 2017, when the students demonstrated about the mess, four students were fired for one session only
 chaatr hoicourt gaye, hoicourt ne kaha ki college jaaiye
 One of these students has not been withdrawn yet
 is chaatr ko college ke andar aane kii manaahi he
 Is it not too much that a student should not be allowed to come to college, to be given such a huge punishment for performing, then to whom the student should be punished for colleges which are not teachers
 sunil chopra ko hastal se niklaa diya he
 How will the situation improve when the students do not raise their voices, do not perform sit-ins
 central uniwarsity ke research scoler ne kendriya maanav sansaadhan rajya mantri satyapal singh ko patr likh kar kai baton par unka dhyaan kheenchna chaha he
 It has been written that the cost of VC housing has increased from 1 crore 62 lakh to 2 crore 25 lakh

 Till date, nothing has been prepared for the field, pitch, practice net

 We emailed VC but no response was received
 ujisi ne world class uniwarsity banane ke liye jo guideline banaai he uske anusaar vahaan edock teacher nahin ho sakate hai

 dilli vishvavidhyalay ke college to edock ke bharose hi chal rahe hai
 On November 7, Delhi University Teachers Association is going to sit in front of VC office
 2009 se shikshakon ko pramotion nahin mila he

 BJP MP Nishikant Dubey has spoken to ECL officials and raised the issue
 ek sawaal baar baar uthta he ki jahaan teacher kii sankhya itani kam he un collejon ko grad kaise mil jaataa he
 Does Naik's grading make any sense? Some buildings at Jain College Ara were painted three times under the guise of Naik's team
 aakhir jahaan 132 shikshak hone chahie, 65 hi hai to phir use koi bhi grading kis chiz kii di ja rahi he, kya aara ke naujavaanon ko jhansa dene ke liye ki ise bi grad hasil he aap yahaan admician lete rahiye or phir class kii jagah baraamde main mundi gaadkar railway guard kii taiyaari karte rahiye
 The Indian government should investigate the NAC system only to see what is happening
 nack kii team har jagah jane or grad dene ke liye fees leti he college se
 Eleven and a half thousand children study in Jain College Ara
 is sankhya ke hisaab se yahaan shikshakon ke liye manzur padon kii sankhya 350 se 400 ke bich honi chahie lekin manzur padon kii sankhya 132 hi he
 Out of this 132, 65 are teachers
 yahaan ke puraane principal ne college ko kaaphi barbaad kiya lekin jo nae aaen hai wo kaaphi prayaas kar rahe hai jiskaa koi nateeja nahin he
 The principal has given in writing that there is a huge shortage of teachers here
 aap jaanate hi hai ki bharat main kisi samasya ko likhit main de dena kitni badi baat hoti he
 There is an open urinal at the eastern gate of Jain College Ara
 college main shauchalay kaa itnaa bura haal he ki shikshakon ko ghar janaa padataa tha, darasal aap samaj hi sakate honge ki ve bhi aise kisi purvi get kaa hi sahaara le lete honge
 Teachers told that before the arrival of new principal, you cannot even use the college toilets, they have paid attention to cleanliness
 principal sahab samaj gaye hai ki shikshakon kii bhartee unke bas kii baat nahin he isliye unhen biometric system par hi sahaara he taaki jo nahin aate hai wo to aane lag jaaen
 a story of Jain College Ara's toilet is revealed
 yahaan ladakiyon ke liye shauchalay nahin he jabaki yahaan paanch se chah hazaar ladkiyaan padhati hai
 The girls' common room has one toilet room with four toilets
 ladakiyon ke liye alag se ek shauchalay or bana tha lekin wo do dhai saal se band tha
 When the college opened the toilet to prepare for the reception of Naik's team, it had boys' urinals in it
 aisa ghotaalaa or kahaan ho saktaa he
 The toilet was again closed so that the college would not be in disrepute
 aap sochie paanch hazaar ladakiyon par kul paanch shauchalay hai
 While 6 girls should have a toilet
 kya is sthiti main chatraayen college aati hongi
 The Union Minister of State for Home Affairs is Rajkumar Singh Ara's MP
 magar yah samajhnaa hoga ki is samasya ko bees pachis saal se paala posa ja rahaa he
 After all, why Ara, which is such an energetic city, could not manage a college of its own
 phir aara zila ghar ba, koun baat ke dar ba kehane kaa kya matlab he
 What was the result of that courage for the city
 maharaja college pehle jaj sahab kii kothi ke naam se mashhoor thi
 Maharaj Kamal Singh of Dumraon donated 25 bighas of land for the college in memory of his father
 isaki kuch imaaraten rangi puti hai
 But inside this college is also a perfect example of India's lowest status of higher education
 yahaan das hazaar chaatr padhate hai
 i was surprised to hear that 2500 students study in history subject from Inter to PG
 kisi ko pataa lagaana chahie ki yahaan itihaas itnaa lokapriy kyon he, kya shikshak kamaal ke hai yaa phir chaatro ko pataa he ki bhavishya to barbaad ho chukaa he to kyon na jite jite ji itihaas ban jaaen
 This college has only one permanent teacher in the entire college to teach history to 2500 students
 kya aapako ab bhi uniwarsity series boring lag rahi he
 Here, 2500 students from Inter to PG are studying history as a permanent teacher
 teen asthaayee shikshak hai jinhen vetan nahin miltaa he
 Since 1997, these teachers have not received money
 yah sab sunate hue aapako kya lag rahaa he, aap nayaa india main he yaa gaya india main hai
 If no one gets money since 1997, why is he teaching or why is he teaching, has the system taken away the right to be a human being by giving hope of a job
 750 chaatr physics onors main he or 4 shikshak hi hai
 Doesn't your heart burst when you see this, that there are one teacher on 2500 students
 maharaja college main 82 pad manzur hai magar 37 shikshak hi hai
 If we look at the number of students, then the number of sanctioned posts of teachers should be 300 to 400, but there is a mismatch in sanctioned posts as well
 aap is chaatr ko suniye or sochie ki hamaari uniwarsity system ne naujavaanon kii kya haalat kar di he
 Both these colleges come under Bir Kunwar Singh University
 bir kunwar singh kii jayanti pad jaae to sab mantri car lekar pahunch jaaenge or unka vaaris bataane lagenge magar unke naam par bani uniwarsity kii ye haalat he

 The condition of Central University Ajmer can be understood through old photographs of the movement

 The VC promised to accept all the demands but retracted from the student union elections
 chaatr ad gaye to 50 se 60 andolankaaree chaatro ko 15 dinon ke liye resticket kar diya gaya
 In March 2017, when the students demonstrated about the mess, four students were fired for one session only
 chaatr hoicourt gaye, hoicourt ne kaha ki college jaaiye
 One of these students has not been withdrawn yet
 is chaatr ko college ke andar aane kii manaahi he
 Is it not too much that a student should not be allowed to come to college, to be given such a huge punishment for performing, then to whom the student should be punished for colleges which are not teachers
 sunil chopra ko hastal se niklaa diya he
 How will the situation improve when the students do not raise their voices, do not perform sit-ins

 jain college aara main saadhe gyaarah hazaar bachche padhate hai
 According to this number, the number of sanctioned posts for teachers here should be between 350 and 400 but the number of sanctioned posts is only 132
 is 132 main se 65 shikshak hi hai
 The old principal here ruined the college a lot, but the newcomers who are coming here are trying a lot which has no result
 praachaarya ne likhit main diya he ki yahaan shikshak kii baari kami he
 You know how big a problem it is to give a problem in writing in India
 jain college aara ke purvi get par open mutralay he
 The toilet in the college is in such a bad condition that the teachers had to go home, in fact you must have understood that they too would have resorted to any such eastern gate
 shikshakon ne bataaya ki nae principal ke aane ke pehle to aap college ke shauchalay kaa istemaal bhi nahin kar sakate hai, unhone saaf safai par dhyaan diya he
 Principal sir has understood that the recruitment of teachers is not just about him, so he has recourse on the biometric system so that those who do not come can start coming
 jain college aara ke shauchalay kii ek kahani pataa chali he
 There are no toilets for girls, whereas five to six thousand girls study here
 ladakiyon ke kaaman room main shauchalay ke liye ek hi cameraa he jisamen chaar paanch shauchalay hai
 a separate toilet was made for girls but it was closed for two and a half years
 nack kii team ke swaagat kii taiyaari ke liye jab college ne us shauchalay ko kholaa to usamen ladakon ke urinal lage the
 Where else can such a scam happen
 phir se us shauchalay ko band kar diya gaya taaki college kii badanaami na ho
 Think about five toilets for five thousand girls
 jabaki 6 ladakiyon par ek shauchalay hona chahie
 Will the students come to college in this situation
 kendriya grih rajya mantri rajkumaar singh aara ke hi saansad hai
 But it has to be understood that this problem is being brought up for twenty-five years

 Ten thousand students study here
 main to sunakar hairaan rah gaya ki yahaan inter se piji tak itihaas vishay main 2500 chaatr padhate hai
 One must find out why history is so popular here, whether the teachers are amazing or the students know that the future is ruined, so why not live it and become history
 2500 chaatro ko itihaas padhaane ke liye is college main puure college main ek hi sthaayee shikshak he
 Do you still find the university series boring? yahaan par ek sthaayee shikshak ke bharose inter se piji ke 2500 chaatr itihaas pard rahe hai
 There are three temporary teachers who do not receive salary
 1997 se in shikshakon ko paisa nahin mila he
 Hearing all this, how do you feel, are you in Naya India or are you in Gaya India
 1997 se kisi ko paisa na mili to wo kyon padhaaye yaa kyon padhaa rahaa he, kya system ne naukari kii ummid dekar insaan se insaan hone kaa haq chin liya he
 750 students are in Physics Honors and 4 are teachers
 kya yah sab dekh sunakar aapkaa kalejaa nahin fatataa ki 2500 chaatro par ek shikshak hai
 Maharaja College has 82 posts, but 37 teachers
 chaatro kii sankhya ke hisaab se dekhenge to yahaan shikshakon ke manzur padon kii sankhya 300 se 400 honi chahie magar manzur padon main bhi ghapala he
 Listen to this student and think about the condition of youth in our university system

 maharaja college pehle jaj sahab kii kothi ke naam se mashhoor thi
 Maharaj Kamal Singh of Dumraon donated 25 bighas of land for the college in memory of his father
 isaki kuch imaaraten rangi puti hai
 But inside this college is also a perfect example of India's lowest status of higher education
 yahaan das hazaar chaatr padhate hai

 Here, 2500 students from Inter to PG are studying history as a permanent teacher

 Since 1997, these teachers have not received money
 yah sab sunate hue aapako kya lag rahaa he, aap nayaa india main he yaa gaya india main hai
 If no one gets money since 1997, why is he teaching or why is he teaching, has the system taken away the right to be a human being by giving hope of a job
 750 chaatr physics onors main he or 4 shikshak hi hai
 Doesn't your heart burst when you see this, that there are one teacher on 2500 students
 maharaja college main 82 pad manzur hai magar 37 shikshak hi hai
 If we look at the number of students, then the number of sanctioned posts of teachers should be 300 to 400, but there is a mismatch in sanctioned posts as well

 If you also like hot hot tea, then be careful, because drinking strong hot tea can make you vulnerable to cancer
 ji haa, haal hi main hui ek study kii report main saamne aayaa he ki zyada garm chaay pine se asophagal cancer kaa khatra kaaphi bad jaataa he

 In addition to tea, the team of researchers have described the consumption of hot coffee, hot chocolate and other hot things as harmful
 haalanki, study main yah bhi bataaya gaya he ki agar aap asophagal cancer se surakshit rahanaa chaahate hai, to aapako chaay chhodane kii jarurat nahin he, balki kam se kam 4 minute intjaar kar ke chaay yaa anya garm chizon ke thodaa thanda hone par hi unka seven karen
 Doing so reduces the risk of getting cancer
 maharashtra main siem post par bijepi-shivasena kii daavedarifdenvis ke baad shah kaa siem post par spasht sandeshmaharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav kaa bigul baj chukaa he
 The BJP as well as the Shiv Sena are eyeing the chief minister's post
 shivasena kii daavedaari ke bich mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne kaha ki CM pad mere liye pehle se fiks he
 After this, BJP President Amit Shah also confirmed his statement that Devendra Fadnavis is the Chief Minister and will be the same CM in future
 isse saaf ho gaya ki maharashtra kaa aglaa mukhyamantri shivasena se nahin hoga
 Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis told India Today Conclave-2019 platform that he had no objection to the appointment of Aditya Thackeray, son of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray as deputy chief minister
 lekin mukhyamantri pad vahi rakhenge
 He also said that the way Shiv Sena leader Aditya Thackeray is taking part in active politics, he welcomes him
 fadanvis ke daawey par bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne bhi ravivaar ko maharashtra main jaakar muhar laga di
 In a program organized on Article 370, Amit Shah said that the people of Maharashtra made it clear that Devendra Fadnavis will be the Chief Minister of Maharashtra after the election
 shah kaa yah bayaan shivasena liye ek sandesh bhi he or bijepi kii ore se do-took jawaab bhi
 Actually, the dates of Maharashtra assembly elections have been announced, but the seat sharing between BJP and Shiv Sena has not been agreed yet
 badale hue raajnneetik sameekaran ko dekhte hue bijepi shivasena se zyada siton par chunaav ladanaa chaahati he
 At the same time, Shiv Sena wants to split the seat according to the 50-50 formula set during the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin bijepi usapar raji nahin he
 At the same time there was some doubt about the post of Chief Minister
 haalanki fadanvis ke baad ab amit shah ke bayaan se bijepi kaa rukh spasht ho gaya he or isi ke saath shivasena ke mukhyamantri pad par daavedaari ke raste bhi band ho gaye hai
 However, there is no objection to BJP giving the post of Deputy Chief Minister to Shiv Sena
 maharashtra vidhansabha chunaavon main agar gathbandhan sarkaar banati he to kya aditya thakare upmukhyamantri honge
 On this question, Fadnavis had said, 'shiv Sena will take a decision on this
 ham yah faisla nahin kar sakate
 The last expansion of the government, then, i had asked the Shiv Sena if they wanted to make someone from their party a deputy CM
 lekin shivasena ne kaha tha ki vakt kam he, lihaaja abhi kisi ko dipti siem nahin bananaa chaahate'
 Devendra Fadnavis said that everything is possible in politics
 aditya thakare bahut achche se raajnneeti ke gur sikh rahe hai
 Aditya should also follow the decision taken by Balasaheb Thackeray and Uddhav Thackeray not to enter active politics
 kabhi na kabhi unhen shivasena kii bagdor sanbhaalani he
 In fact, after the Lok Sabha elections, Shiv Sena started presenting its claim on the CM post
 isi ke maddenjar mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis kii jan aashirwad yatra ke samanaantar shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ke bete aditya thakare bhi janadesh yatra karke maahaul banane main jute hai
 Therefore, Shiv Sena is demanding to contest on equal seats with the BJP so that by winning more seats, it can stake claim on the post of CM
 lekin amit shah or fadanvis ne spasht kar diya he ki siem kii post par bijepi kaa kabja rahegaa

 - input language upi main congress-samaajawaadee party gathbandhan main bhoomika nibhaa chukin priyanka gandhi 2019 main raibareli loksabhaa se chunaav lard sakati hai
 The party has also accepted Priyanka Gandhi's role in UP
 lekin bhavishya main priyanka gandhi kii sakriy raajnneeti main bhoomika kya hogi, is bare main party chup he
 However, all Congressmen want to see Priyanka Gandhi in active politics
 kya priyanka gandhi raibareli loksabhaa seat se 2019 main sonia gandhi kii jagah chunaav maidan main hongi? upi main congress or samaajawaadee party gathbandhan main priyanka gandhi kii bhoomika ke baad is baat kii ummid ab bahut bad gai he
 And there are many other signs
 'ajtak' pehle bhi priyanka ke raibareli se sonia kii jagah loksabhaa chunaav ladane kii khabar de chukaa he, jab sonia gandhi kii beemaari ke baad dilli main raibareli ke logon kii shikaayatein sunne kaa jimmaa priyanka gandhi hi uthaane lageen thim
 At the same time, Priyanka is going to express condolences on the death of senior Congress leader in Rae Bareli for a long time
 vajahen or bhi hai
 Sonia's health is not good and in 2019, Sonia would have been 72 years old
 saath hi 2014 kii modi lahar main bhi rahul amethi loksabhaa seat chhodkar raibareli se aglaa loksabhaa chunaav ladane kaa vikalp khaarij kar chuke hai or teesri vajah ye he kipriyanka main logon ko indira gandhi kii chhavi dikhti haior raibareli se indira gandhi chunaav ladati thim
 And now Priyanka herself is deciding the tickets of Rae Bareli and Amethi and is making the decisions of the organization
 is par congress netaa pramod tiwari kehete hai, 'priyanka ji kab raajnneeti main aaengi or kahaan se chunaav ladengi ye to gandhi parivaar tay karegaa
 But when Rahul ji came, Sonia ji chose Amethi seat of father Rajiv ji for her and herself went to Rae Bareli from where Indira ji used to contest
 ham sabko priyanka ji main indira ji kii chhavi dikhti he
 On the other hand, in the UP elections, there is a constant demand for Priyanka Gandhi to campaign outside Rae bareli-amethi
 upi ke maidan main priyanka gandhi or samaajawaadee party kii netaa dimple yadav bhi ek manch par aa sakati hai
 However, the party is currently speculating these reports
 haalanki upi vidhansabha chunaav ke liye star prachaarkon kii suchi mempichley kai chunaavon kii tarah priyanka gandhi kaa naam is baar bhi he
 But what will be Priyanka Gandhi's future role within the Congress will be decided on the future of the Congress and the decision of the Gandhi family and Priyanka Gandhi
 lekin halaat ishaara kar rahe hai ki, bhale hi 2017 ke upi ke chunaav main priyanka kii bhoomika saaf nahin he
 But she can definitely be seen fighting the Lok Sabha elections from Rae Bareli in 2019

 The Senate approved 66-year-old Hagel's appointment as defense minister yesterday after a lengthy debate

 The Obama administration has been relieved after Hagel's name was approved
 hagal kaa namakan lambey samay se lataka hua tha or democratic party tathaa white house ko sabhi ko inke naam par sahamat karne ke liye kaaphi mehnat kerani padi
 It is believed that many Republican senators voted in his favor, despite Hagel's previous statements and outrage over the vote
 republican party kaa aarope tha ki hagal israel ke maamle main kuch zyada hi katu hai, jabaki iran ke saath unka ruukh samjhauta karne vaala he
 Republicans are also angry with Hagel's views on NATO
 hagal ne apane bhaashan main america netritv vaali nato sena kii upyogita or auchity par sawaal khadey kiye the
 After Hagel's name was approved, President Barack Obama said that Hagel is the defense minister that America needs
 unhone kaha, ‘dwidaleey manjuuri ke baad chak hagal hamaare nae raksha mantri hai, hamen aisa mantri mila he jisaki desh ko jarurat he or ek aisa netaa jaisaa hamaari sena ko chahie
 In the statement, Obama said that he believed in Hagel's decisions in terms of ending the war in Afghanistan, bringing back troops, dealing with threats from time to time, and maintaining the military as the world's best military
 hagal ko raksha mantri banaae jane kii manjuuri milane se ek din pehle hi bharat ke sambandh main unke ek vivaadit bayaan kaa video internet par aayaa tha
 In contrast to the Obama administration's view of India's role in Afghanistan, Hagel alleged in his speech that India has been using Afghanistan to create problems for Pakistan for years
 oklahoma camerun uniwarsity main varsh 2011 main die gaye is bhaashan kaa (jo kabhi baahar nahin aayaa) video ‘washington free beckens’ ne aplod kiya he
 India had reacted sharply to this, saying such comments were 'contrary to the truth' of its commitment to the welfare of Afghanistan
 hagal ne us bhaashan main kaha, ‘kuch vakt se bharat ne afghanistan ko hameshaa yuddh ke duusare morche (pakistan ke saath yuddh kaa doosraa morcha) ke rup main istemaal kiya he or bharat vashren se pakistan kii seemaa (afghanistan-pakistan seemaa) par utpann samasyaon kaa vitt poshan kar rahaa he
 Reacting sharply to the comment, the Indian embassy here said, "these remarks of Senator Hagel, a long-time friend of India and a member of India and the United States recommending close ties to the truth of India's commitment to the welfare of the people of Afghanistan
" Are exactly the opposite

 Chinese official media termed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's demonetisation move as 'very bold' and said it was a 'gamble' which would set an example
 chini media kii ore se yah bhi kaha gaya he ki bhale hi yah kadam safal rahe yaa vifal sabit ho, china bhrashtachar par iske prabhaav se sabak legaa
 The official newspaper 'global Times', in an article titled' Modi Tex a Gamble with Money Reform ', said that' Modi's step is very bold
 ham is baat kii kalpana nahin kar sakate ki yadi china 50 or 100 yuan ke note band kar detaa he to china main kya hoga
 'the highest denomination note in China is 100 yuan
 sampadakeey main kaha gaya ‘soochna li hone se bachaane ke liye notebandi sambandhi kadam ke kriyanvayan ko khatre main daalate hue yojana ko gopneey rakhana padaa
 Modi is currently in a dilemma as the aim of this reform is to waste black money but this process is contrary to the administration's principle of gaining public support before the introduction of any new policy
 ’ isamen kaha gaya he ki‘bharat main 90 pratishat se adhik len dein nakad main kiya jaataa he, aise main chalan main maujuud 85 pratishat noton ke pratibandhit hone se logon ko dainik jivan main bahut mushkil kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 'it is further written that' Demonetisation may lead to action against corruption and illegal economic activities, but it is clearly incapable of solving deep social and political matters which are helpful in exacerbating the problems mentioned earlier
 bhrashtachar kii maujuudagi kii jad kii baat he to samasyaayein hameshaa phir se paidaa hongi
 ' iske alaava chini media ne yah bhi kaha he ki 'anya shabdon main, modi sarkaar lambii or kathin sudhaar prakriya ko ek baar main karnaa chaahati he
 The editorial states that 'notebandi is a gamble for Modi
 unhone sarkaar kii kriyanvayan kshamta or bhartiya samaaj kii sahanshakti ke str donon par is ummid se daav lagaaya he ki is sudhaar ke laabh nakaaratmak saamaajik prabhaav or gire hue manobal par baari pad sakate hai
 It states that there is little space for such bold steps in India's 'western-style' democratic system
 tippaniyan The editorial states that he is executing it and whether this step succeeds or fails, it will set an example
 ’isamen kaha gaya he ‘sudhaar karnaa hameshaa mushkil hota he or iske liye saahas ke alaava bhi kai chizon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Modi has demonetised with good intentions but whether it will succeed or not depends on the efficiency of the system and the cooperation of the whole society
 is prakriya ko niyantrit karne main modi sarkaar kii kshamta ko lekar zyada se zyada log nirashaavadi ho rahe hai
 The editorial says that China has been improving for nearly 40 years and making the economy free
 isamen kai utaar-chadhaav aae lekin yah vyapak rup se sthir rahaa
 Its success depends largely on the support of the people
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) The editorial said that in order to prevent leakage of information, the plan had to be kept confidential while jeopardizing the implementation of demonetisation steps
 modi is samay duvidha kii sthiti main hai kyonki is sudhaar kaa makasad kaledhan ko bekaar karnaa he lekin yah prakriya koi nai niti kii shuruyaat se pehle jan samarthan hasil karne ke prashasan ke siddhant ke vipareet he
 'it states that' more than 90 percent of transactions in India are done in cash, so people are facing a lot of difficulty in daily life due to the prohibition of 85 percent currency notes in circulation
 ’ aage likhaa gaya he ki 'notebandi se bhrashtachar or avaidh aarthik gatividhiyon ke khilaaf karrwai ho sakati he lekin yah un gahari saamaajik evam raajnneetik maamalon ko sulajhane main spasht rup se aksham he jo purv main bataai gai samasyaon ko badhaane main madadgaar hai
 If the presence of corruption is the root cause then problems will always arise again
 ' Apart from this, the Chinese media has also said that 'in other words, the Modi government wants to carry out the long and difficult reform process at once
 ’ sampadakeey main kaha gaya he ki‘notebandi modi ke liye jua he
 He has claimed both the government's execution ability and the stamina level of Indian society in the hope that the benefits of this reform may outweigh the negative social impact and fallen morale
 ’ isamen kaha gaya he ki bharat kii ‘pashchimi style’ kii loktantric pranali main is prakaar ke saahasik kadamon ke liye kam hi sthaan he
 The comments sampadakeey main kaha gaya he ‘vah ise anjaam de rahe hai or yah kadam bhale hi safal rahe yaa asafal ho, yah ek misaal pesh karegaa
 It is always said that it is always difficult to improve and it requires many things apart from courage
 modi ne nek iraade se notebandi kii he lekin yah safal hoga yaa nahin, yah baat pranali kii dakshata or puure samaaj ke sahyog par nirbhar karti he
 More and more people are becoming pessimistic about the Modi government's ability to control this process
 ’sampadakeey main kaha gaya he ki china kareeb 40 saal se sudhaar kar rahaa he or arthvyavastha ko mukt bana rahaa he

 ) a full-page account of the functioning of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi was published in Punjab newspapers on Friday
 punjab kaa koi bhi akhbaar aisa nahin tha, jisamen shuukravaar ko is tarah ke phul pej aid naa chape ho
 The Congress has accused the Aam Aadmi Party of extravagance over these advertisements
 congress kaa kahana he ki ye kejariwal sarkaar kaa chunavi stant he
 The Congress surrounded the Aam Aadmi Party on the excuse of government money in Delhi and said that this money should be used for the development of people living below the poverty line in Delhi
 AAP ne kaha-vigyapanon kaa punjab chunaav se lenaa-dena nahikhabaron main chhapi in ishtehaar-numa khabaron ke bare main jab aam aadmi party se poocha gaya, to unhone kaha ki in ishtehaaron kaa punjab main aane walevidhansabha chunaavse koi lenaa-dena nahin he or is tarah ke ishtehaar aam aadmi party kii taraf se punjab main hi nahin, balki tamilnadu main bhi die jate he, taaki logon ko pataa lag sake ki agar dilli menam aadmi partiki sarkaar itane achche se kaam karti he, to phir unke rajya main bhi duusari party kii sarkaar aisi hi achche se kaam kar sakati he
 According to the fixed budget and rules, the Delhi government is spending money on such commercials

 However, by praising the work of the Dilli government in the newspapers of Punjab, the Aam Aadmi Party has made it clear that their target is on the chair of Punjab, but the question is whether the people of Punjab have these advertisements of Aam Aadmi Party and Relying on the claims will give them the same support as the people of Delhi in the Delhi Assembly elections

 isliye khud ko man kii sari jakadanon se aaazaad kar den or dusron ke kiye ko maaf karke apni jindagi main khushiyaan laane kii pahal karen
 Whatever you do, do it deliberately
 The work of fasting is the work of Satan, so avoid doing this
 agar aapke man main koi baat he jise aap apni patni se kahana chaahate hai to pehle uske bhale or nakusaan kaa soch len
 Know that your wife has a different image in your mind and what you are going to tell them about, can hurt her feelings with the breaking of this image
 isliye maukey kii nazaakat ko dekhakar baat hi koi unase share karen
 Give some time to the wife also
 If you have told your wife about it, then give them some time so that they understand that and then they will be able to take a decision
 aap to apane man kii kashmakash se baahar nikaal chuke hai lekin aapaki patni duvidha main hai
 Therefore, now give them a chance to say their words
 agar aapkaa rishta prem va samaj se bana he to vah aapaki baat ko jald hi samaj jaaengi
 Be ready for every result
 Everybody has different power to think, so be prepared for any outcome or result
 ho saktaa he aapaki patni bhi aapako kuch bataanaa chaah rah hon
 You have said yourselves, it is time to listen to them jis tarah aapke raaj ne aapaki patni ko hairaan kiya he usee tarah aapakipatni kaa rahasy aapako pareshaan kar saktaahai
 But the story ahead depends on the loyalty and love of both of you
 agar aapkaa rishta pyaar ke bandhan main bandhaa he phir sab kuch bhulaakar aage badhane main hi samajhadaari he
