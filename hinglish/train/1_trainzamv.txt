 nothing but grateful ‬A post shared by Akshay Kumar (@akshaykumar) on Oct 8, 2017 at 3:46am PDT The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was at the peak of its ideological movement
 uske rathi laalkrishna adwani kii ram rathyatra bihar main loktantr kii janmabhumi kahe jane vaale hajipur pahunchane vaali thi, jise rokane par amada bihar ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri lalu prasad yadav ne elaan kar diya tha ki rath ko gandhi sethu paar nahin karne denge
 At the same time, a young face was emerging in the BJP from the background of the Sangh
 usne lalu kii satta ko chunauti di or elaan kiya ki ram rath yatra ko hajipur main nahin rokane diya jayega
 Then only 23-year-old Nityananda Rai called the Maha Panchayat and gathered such support that the government could not muster the courage to stop Advani's chariot in Hajipur
 raay ne hajipur main adwani kii jansabha bhi karai
 But he had to bear the brunt of taking the iron from the government
 hajipur audyogic kshetra main sthit bihar kii plastic houseold nirmaan kii pehali privet limidet company kii factory, jo plastic kii baltiyaan banane main agrani thi, sarkari chaabuk kaa shikaar hui
 He was forced to close
 is prakaran kii vajah se nityanand raay kii pahchaan raajnneeti kii shuruyaat main hi dabang or nirbhik kaaryakarta kii ban gai
 But, now the 49-year-old Rai's career took a major turn when Ramlal, a BJP national organization general secretary, got a call in the early hours of November 30, 2016, "you have to discharge the post of party president in the state
" '' raay india today se kehete hai, ''achaanak badi jimmedaari kaa ehsaas hua
 It was resolved in my mind that i have to lead
 rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah or pradhanmantri narendra modi ji ne jo jimmedaari saunpi he, uske liye ji-jaan laga duungaa
 "after nearly a year of brainstorming, the way Shah has handed over the command of Bihar BJP to Nityananda Rai is his biggest bet in political terms, and there is a pain hidden behind it
" chanakya kii dharti kahe jane vaale bihar ke vidhansabha chunaav main mili karaari haar bijepi ke chanakya kahe jane vaale shah ke adhyakshiya kaarykaal kaa aisa daag he jise dhone ke liye raay ko dirghakaalik ranneeti kaa cheharaa mana ja rahaa he
 In the 2015 assembly elections, the BJP, in terms of social equations, has pointed to the future strategy by handing over the party's command to an OBC (yadav) leader instead of a upper caste
 isse ek jatke main pradesh sanghathan main peedigat badlaav bhi ho gaya he
 According to sources, the bjp's strategy is to create a new bouquet of social equations and bring the organization out of the domination of any one leader and bring it back on track
 iske peeche party kii ranneeti lalu ke baad yadav vot bank ko tejasvi yadav ke saath jane se rokane ke saath-saath agadon, pichhadon-ati pichhadon or daliton ko milakar nayaa saamaajik sameekaran taiyaar karnaa he
 Rai, who is traveling in politics with principles and firm intentions, has brought not only the national leadership, but also the factional Bihar BJP on the consensus stage
 adhyaksh pad ke liye vidhayakon se lekar saansadon tak kai naamon kii charchaa hui, lekin amit shah ke maapdandon par sirf raay hi khare utar paae
 a senior leader says, "the party wanted a young face that had a strong hold in the organization, as well as being able to get the organization out of the grip of a strong leader's lobby and leaders of other caste factions
" 
 '' lekin itani deree ke baad raay hi kyon? is sawaal par bihar bijepi ke prabharee mahasachiv bhupendra yadav kehete hai, ''aane vaale samay main bihar main hamen vaicharik rup se patibaddh sanghathan khadaa karnaa he, yahi soch-samajhakar nirnay liya gaya he
 Rai is a grassroots activist, a youth, he has a consensus on his name and is a man associated with the ideological movement
 sanghathan main sabko saath lekar chalane main sakasham hai
 "though Rai denies any factionalism, but those who know him closely say that he loves to bring sweetness and sweetness in relationships by respecting people
 darasal raay ke paksh main apni umr se bada anubhav or har str par kaam karke sanghathan kii baarikiyon ko samajhane kii kshamta prabhavi sabit hui
 Rai's political journey began in 1981 as an activist of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad
 hajipur ke hi rajanarayan college main inter kii padhai ke dauraan ve niyamit sangh kii shakhaon main jate the
 Due to his leadership ability, the Sangh soon made him the Tehsil of Hajipur in 1986
 uske baad to ve sanghathan kii har seedhi chadhate chale gaye
 By the early 1990s he was relieved of the post and became the state secretary of the BJP Yuva Morcha directly
 1995-96 main yuva morcha ke mahasachiv or 1999 main yuva morcha ke pradesh adhyaksh bane
 In the first time, he won the 2000 assembly elections from Hajipur, considered the capital of Socialists and the birthplace of democracy
 ve vahaan se lagaataar chaar vidhansabha chunaav jite or do baar usee seat se mandal str ke aise kaaryakarta ko chunaav jitavaaya, jo jati sameekaran main kahin bhi feet nahin baithta tha
 The party won this seat even in the opposite atmosphere of 2015
 raay 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ujiyarpur loksabhaa seat se saansad bane
 After the election victory, his father also preferred moral values in politics
 ve pehali baar vidhayak chune gaye to raay ke pita divangat ganga vishnu raay, jo lagaataar karnpura gram panchayat ke mukhiya the, hafte bhar ke bheetar hi mukhiya pad kii jimmedaari up-mukhiya ko saunp kar kinare ho gaye the
 a BJP leader says that in politics only such leaders will be found who will reject the MLA ticket offer to other family members
 darasal bijepi ke rashtriya mahasachiv kailash vijayawargeey vidhansabha chunaav main vaishali jile kaa prabhaar sambhaal rahe the
 He felt that if he fought against Lalu's son Tejashwi from Raghopur seat, Nityananda's family could be won
 unhone raay se kaha ki aap apni patni ko chunaav ladavaaen
 But Rai said, "familyism is completely contrary to my view
 aapse vinati he ki is bare main kisi bhi tarah kii charchaa aage na badhayen
 However, his wife Amita Rai is associated with social activities
 nau varsh kii beti nandika patna main pard rahi he
 Rai alleges that Lalu has only done good to the family in the name of the community, so the Yadav society now also decides that it needs a leader (nityananda) or a son (lalu Yadav's son and Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav)
 kisaan prishthbhumi or itihaas main snaatak raay aaj bhi 20 acre main amaruud, kelaa or subjiyon kii kheti karte hai
 They also plow themselves with plows and tractors when given a chance
 apane ghar ke liye ve puri tarah se organic kheti karte hai
 Rai, who usually wear pant-shirts, kurta-pajamas, prefer to wear a dhoti in the village
 samarthakon main nitya bhaiya ke naam se mashhoor ve lalu ke mukaable bijepi ke dabang cheharaa maane jate hai to nitish kumaar ke mukaable saumy or ranneeti banane main tikshn
 He loves traditional food like mustard greens, corn bread and milk-yogurt
 fitness ke liye yoga or vyaayaam ke baad ve chacha se apane din kii shuruyaat karte hai
 Rai, who uses a simple keypad mobile, works by creating a weekly routine
 khelkud main footbal ke shaukeen raay ko maaloom he ki kahaan se kik lagane par ball sidhe gol post main jaaegi
 But after a long spell, Shah has given a leadership in Bihar that can understand the farmers while doing village-country politics
 bijepi ko patna mahanagar jaise shahari kshetra se baahar nikaalkar gramin kshetra main le jane ke liye sangharkshil prishthbhumi vaale ganga paar ke yuva netaa raay ko bijepi ne kaman to saunp di he, lekin kya ve sanghathan kii uthapatak khatm kar virdohi mahagathbandhan ko parrast kar paaenge?

 com / h3d0jtx9ly In April last year, some intimate scenes of a short film by Anurag Kashyap went viral on whatsapp
 is film main radhika apte ne mukhya bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Now a year later, the 30-year-old actress is reported to have illegally released intimate scenes of another film on the internet
 ajay devgan dwaara nirmit or leena yadav dwaara nirdeshit film 'parced' ke do antarang drishy internet par avaidh rup se jari kiye gaye hai
 In one scene, Radhika Apte and actor Adil Hussain are seen, while in another their co-star Tannishtha Chatterjee is seen
 is sambandh main film nirmaataaon ne sibar cell main shikaayat darj karwaai he
 According to a report in the English newspaper 'the Indian Express', actor Adil Hussain said, "I felt very strange
 yah dikhaata he ki hamaare samaaj ke kuch log yon sambandhon ko lekar pagal hai
 Only intimate scenes were leaked, not other beautiful scenes from the film
 yah dikhaata he ki ham yon sambandhon ko lekar kis had tak sochate hai lekin is bare main baat karnaa nahin chaahate
 The most important thing is that the leaked video has been titled as 'radhika Apte Sex Scene' and not 'adil Hussain Sex Scene'
 yah samaaj ki us soch ko bhi dikhaata he ki purush yah sab kare to chalata he par mahila kare to badi baat ho jaati he
 "comments vah kehete hai, 'yah jarur kisi bhartiya purush ne kiya he
 "last year, Anurag Kashyap also said that when a scene of his short film was leaked online
 times of india ko die ek intervyuu main kashyap ne kaha tha, "vah satai hui mahasoos kar rahi thi or iske liye main jimmedaar tha
 'anurag considers Radhika to be an outspoken actress
 radhika apte ne pichley saal utyub par viral hui 'ahilya', byopic 'maanjhi- da mountain main', horer film 'phobia' or haal hi main relies hui rajnikant kii 'kabali' main kaam kiya he
 Two intimate scenes of the film 'parched' produced by Ajay Devgan and directed by Leena Yadav have been released illegally on the internet
 ek drishy main radhika apte or abhinayta adil hossain najar aa rahe hai jabaki duusare main unki sah-kalakaar tanishta chatarji najar aa rahi hai
 In this regard, the filmmakers have filed a complaint in the cyber cell
 angreji akhbaar 'da indian express' kii ek report ke mutabik abhinayta adil hossain ne kaha, "mujhe bahut ajeeb laga
 It shows that some people in our society are crazy about sex
 keval antarang drishy li kiye gaye, film ke anya khubasurat drishy nahin
 It shows the extent to which we think about sex but do not want to talk about it
 sabase khaas baat yah he ki li hue video kaa sheershak 'radhika apte sex seen' diya gaya he na ki 'adil hossain sex seen'
 It also shows the society's thinking that if a man does all this then it works but if the woman does it becomes a big thing
 " tippaniyan He says, 'this is definitely done by an Indian man
 " pichley saal yahi baat anuraag kashyap ne bhi kahi thi ki jab unki short film kaa ek seen online li hua tha
 In an interview to Times of India, Kashyap had said, "she was feeling tortured and i was responsible for it
 ' radhika ko anuraag ek himmati adaakara maanate hai
 Radhika Apte has worked on 'ahilya', biopic 'manjhi - The Mountain Man', the horror film 'phobia' and the recently released Rajinikanth's 'kabali', which went viral on youtube last year

 Be it Nirav Modi, Lalit Modi or Narendra Modi? Don't know how many more Modi will come

 But now the truth has come out that the land was bought with the money of Dasa, that is, the land was bought by Dasa

 Jaitley said that Anand Sharma wants to lay the foundation of a wrong tradition that any party or group with a majority in the House can decide the names of the members of the Select Committee
 unhone kaha ki puraa desh dekh rahaa he ki aapane ek sadan main bill kaa samarthan kiya or duusare sadan main aap ise paas hone se rokna chaahate hai

 He said that the government should first accept the amendments and then send the bill to the Select Committee
 anand sharma ne kaha ki ham teen talaak bill kaa virodh nahin kar rahe hai
 But we want that it is the responsibility of all of us when the bill is passed in the Rajya Sabha by passing it from one house
 koi bhi vidheyak vidhaayi jaanch ke madhyam se guzarana chahie
 Parliament cannot have rubber stamp: Anand Sharma: He said that Parliament cannot be a rubber stamp

 What is the Opposition's stance? There are many opposition parties including Congress Party, Samajwadi Party, DMK who are not directly opposing this bill, but want it to be discussed further by the Select Committee of Rajya Sabha To be sent in vipakshi partiyon kaa tark he ki is dil main teen talaak kii haalat main pati ko 3 saal tak ke liye jail bhejne kaa jo praavdhaan he vah gaiyr jaruri he
 This will complicate matters more than solving them

 However, the government argues that this is a very small law that is being made at the behest of the Supreme Court and arrangements have been made to deal with every situation

 After a clean sweep in Haryana in the Lok Sabha elections, BJP is now busy in achieving the target of Mission-75 for the assembly elections
 is lakshya ko hasil karne ke liye bijepi kii najar muslim bahul mevaat par he, jahaan is baar ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhagava fahraane kii taiyaari party ne kar lee he
 This is the reason that BJP is engaged in connecting Mewat's strong Muslim leaders with them
 vidhansabha chunaav se pehle bijepi mevaat ilaake main vipaksh ko tagada jhatka dene ja rahi he
 Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) MLA Chaudhary Zakir Hussain will join BJP on Tuesday in the presence of Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar
 jakir hossain ne inelo se istipha de diya he, unka istipha sweekaar kar liya gaya he
 It is believed that this will help the BJP to strengthen its political ground in Mewat
 jakir hossain mevaat ke kaddavar netaa maane jate hai, jinke bijepi main shaamil hone se party is ilaake main majboot hogi
 Apart from Chaudhary Zakir Hussain, INLD MLA Parminder Singh Dhul has also resigned
 vah bhi bijepi main shaamil hone vaale hai
 The BJP has been making efforts to expand its base in Mewat area for a long time, but due to its Muslim majority, it could not make a foothold here
 isi kaa nateeja he ki 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main mevaat ilaake kii paanch vidhansabha siton main se mahaj ek seat hi jeet saki thi
 While three seats went to the account of INLD and one seat to independents
 is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi bhale hi haryana kii sabhi das siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi, lekin mevaat ilaake kii vidhansabha siton main vah peeche rah gai thi
 This is the reason why BJP has intensified the attempt to hoist saffron in this area in this assembly, under which the INLD MLA from Hathina Kevar Singh Rawat was mixed
 iske baad ab nunh se inelo vidhayak choudhary jakir hossain bhi bijepi main shaamil ho rahe hai
 Whereas, independent MLA from Punhana, Rahish Khan has joined BJP
 bijepi is baar ke vidhansabha chunaav main mevaat kshetra kii 5 vidhansabha siton ko har haal main jeetna chaahati he
 She is doing everything possible for this
 haryana main muslim matadaata 7
 There are 2 per cent, but Mewat has a Muslim population of around 70 per cent
 mevaat ke nunh, punhana, ferozepur jhirka seat par muslim matadaata nirnaayak bhoomika main he
 Apart from this, Sohna and Hathin are in the role of kingmakers on the seat
 isamen hathin seat hi bijepi pichhali baar jeet saki thi

 But more important than that is to believe in yourself
 2
 Things finally come to us in their own way but it is not necessary that they come to us the way they want
 3
 No matter how much money you have, self-worth is in finding what work you can do well
 4
 The problem is that humans have the habit of choosing what is worst for them
 5
 If you want to know about a person, then see how he treats the younger ones rather than see how he is treating his equal
 6
 There are some things that you cannot share without liking each other
 7
 Happiness can be found even in bad times, just you have to remember when you have to light up
 8
 Decisions taken in life tell us what we really are and not our ability to work
 9
 Suppressing the pain for some time aggravates it
 10
 What is your status when born, rather it matters what you become when you grow up

" ''bal yon utpeedakon kaa clasik profile yah he ki ye aise aadmi hai jinka bade hone ke dauraan hinsa se sabaka padaa or ye gusse, nakaaratmakataa, pitayee or naamanzoori ke saath paley-bade
 For them, sexual satisfaction is not the root issue, but the main issue is enmity, anger and domination
 ve aisa yon hinsa ke liye aisa shikaar talashte hai jo apana bachaav na kar sake, taaki ve manachaahe dhang se hinsa or dabadabe kaa istemaal kar saken
 The victim child does not become a 'person' for him but becomes an 'object' and nothing else
 ye mujrim aksar bacchon ke saath sex karne se pehle unhen behosh kar dete yaa maar dete hai
 Research suggests that more violence than sexual gratification stirs the behavior of child rapists
 unamem se kai apane bachapan main yon badasluki ke shikaar ho chuke hote hai
 The more sexual misconduct men have in childhood, the more likely they will grow up to be raped
 bacchon ke tamaam kism ke balaatkaariyon main se 'avasarwaadi' kism ke balaatkaari—jinke liye balaatkaar aaveg ke ek jatke main kiye gaye aparaadhon se kahin zyada bade pattern kaa hissaa hota he—jurm karke sabase zyada batch nikalate hai
 They do not show any anger nor use unnecessary force
 karte bhi hai to keval tab jab apane shikaar ke pratirodh ke jawaab main unhen aisa karnaa padataa he
 There are also those who have sexual fantasies in their hearts and minds, which they commit in rape
 kahin zyada hinsak ve hote hai jinhen 'pratishodhi' kism ke balaatkaariyon ke khaane main rakhaa jaataa he—ye ve aadmi hote hai jo apane shikaar ko shaareerik nuksaan pahunchaate hai or saath hi ve bhi jo duniya ke prati gusse se bhare hote hai
 These people have a long history of violent crimes and they cause the most physical harm to their victims

 Mehta remembers Surinder Koli of the Nithari case, who has been sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of 18 children
 vah aisa parapidak tha jise vayaskon ke saath rishte banane kaa saamaajik hunar nahin aata tha or vah hameshaa bacchon ke saath sex ke bare main sochataa rahata tha
 For the sadist, the fear of the victim becomes sexual excitement
 aparaadh vigyaani hani matiani ne bacchon ke sajayaftaa balaatkaariyon par kiye gaye 2011 ke apane adhyayan (sexual abyus of childrena a soshiological study in dely metropolis) main 100 sajayaftaa mujarimon kaa intervyuu kiya tha, jinamein 38 fisadi ne daawa kiya tha ki unhone pehle se puri yojana banaakar is jurm ko anjaam diya tha
 Most of them — 53 percent — said it did so to satisfy sexual desires, 40 percent did it to get revenge from others, about 5 percent did it for money, and the rest (3 percent) did so because of the victim girl
 Was beautifully fascinated
 iske ulat 62 fisadi sajayaftaa mujarimon ne kaha ki apni karatuut kii koi yojana nahin banaai thi
 Of them, 27 per cent apparently could not control their intense sexual desire by finding the victim alone, 21 per cent claimed that the victim was the only one who instigated them, 15 per cent did so in order to eject hostility, 13 per cent
 Because the victim was living with them and 6 percent did it in a drunken state
 bachche ko hi kyon chunaa? takreeban 34 fisadi ne kaha ki apni umr or uplabdhta kii vajah se shikaar aasaan nishaanaa thi or 15 fisadi ne isliye ki bachche se aasaani se nipta ja saktaa he (dhamkee or jor-jabardastee se)
 Cases of rape and assault of children are generally cruel and barbaric
 isi ke saath mitra yah bhi kehete hai, ''unhen hal karnaa bhi sabase mushkil hota he
 There is usually no witness and the victim often succumbs to injuries
 isamen krime seen ke taur par bachche kaa shav bhar hota he, jisase jurm or mujrim kii jaanch-padtaal kerani padati he
 We do not yet have such professional expertise in forensic investigation
 '' dow
 According to Lalit Vaya, the rape and assault of children becomes barbaric only because of a completely different mindset of the perpetrators
 ve kahati hai, ''ve jab yah karnaa shuru karte hai, tab nahin sochate ki yah krur or barbar he
 But when the victim is not in a position to accept the treatment that is being done to her and resists as much as possible on her behalf, the perpetrator starts losing control over the victim
 vah zyada se zyada aakraamak hota jaataa he, kyonki use santushti nahin milti
 And finally they silence the victim
 '' kai balaatkaariyon main jurm ko anjaam dene ke baad chidh or hikaarat paidaa hoti he
 Mitra explains it, "no atonement or remorse, nor guilt, only irritation and hiccrat, on anything that is against nature, is detrimental to life in terms of Nietzsche's principles, and that is why he The reason for this irritation and hiccrat is killing the victim

 This poisonous smog is hurting not only health but also the skin
 dilli hi nahin, anya shaharon main bhi air polution kii dikkat he
 According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report released in 2016, about half of India is present in the top 20 air polluted cities of the world
 aise main skin ko khaas khyaal kii jarurat hoti he
 According to skin experts, pollution is the biggest enemy of our skin
 darasal, hawa main maujuud dust hamaari skin kii koshikaon meoxigen ke str ko kam kar detaa he
 Due to lack of oxygen in the skin, the skin wrinkles prematurely
 saath hi yah dust main maujuud free radicals skin ko puri tarah se dames karne ke saath colejan ko banane se roktaa he
 Pollution causes not only wrinkles but also skin dryness, red spots due to allergies on the skin and nail pimples start coming out too much
 lekin ham aapako aise upaay bataa rahen jise tri karke aap apni skin ko is jahrile smog ke kahar se bachaa sakate hai
 1
 rojaanaa har 4 ghante baad apane skin par cleanser or toner lagaaein
 2
 yuvi rej se apni skin ko bachaane or fresh rakhane ke liye rojaanaa san scrin jarur lagaaein
 3
 jarmas se hone valeinfections se bachane ke libepane haathon par hameshaa senitizer lagaaein
 4
 apane chehre ko baar baar chhunen se bachein
 Because by doing this your hand germs can damage your facial skin
 5
 Dust in the air closes the pores of your skin, so that the skin cannot breathe
 isse aapaki skin main blike heads or keel muhaanse nikal aate hai
 So use the scrub 2 times a week, especially those who have oily skin
 6
 Drink up to 4 liters of water a day
 ghar se baahar nikalate vakt bhi pani pien
 Due to this, the supply of oxygen in the body will remain right and if the gases present in the atmosphere reach the blood, then they will cause less harm
 7
 Everyone is compelled to go out in such a toxic smog
 lekin baahar se aane ke baad apane chehre ko halke gunagune pani se jarur dhoen
 8
 nahaane ke baad halke haathon se tauliye kaa istemaal karen
 If possible, massage the entire body immediately after bathing with coconut oil or with any oily body lotion

 The copy of this notice and the details of the Whatsapp chat between the lawyer and the model are with Aaj Tak
 isamen vakil ne model ke naam kaa bhi zikr kiya he
 The notice stated that the parsers had been trying to get closer to their client for more than a year
 model or vakil ke bich kathith Whatsapp chat:23 june 2014, 8:52 am:'mujhe haal hi main pataa chalaa he ki sunil parskar kaa model punam pandey ke saath afaire chal rahaa he or parskar ne haal hi main uski publicity hasil karne main madad kii
 Parskar called Poonam to the police station and left with just a warning as part of a case

 The commissioner will keep the media outside the office and give another copy to the media

 According to the notice, the lawyer had made the allegations in his first notice that this model once went to the office of Parskar at Kandivali when he was the Additional Police Commissioner
 model apni fariyaad lekar parskar ke paas gai thi ki kuch agyaat log model ke naam or tasveeron kaa istemaal kar internet par gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se escort sarvice chalaa rahe hai
 According to the lawyer, without any immediate action or preliminary investigation on the model's complaint, Parskar blamed his client for joining the escort service, accusing the complainant and his sister of false complaint
 parskar par lagaaya tha dhauns dene kaa aropanotice ke mutabik model kaa daawa he ki parskar ne apane pad kii dhauns dikhaate hue kaha tha ki agar paise nahin die to use hawalat main band kar denge
 Regardless of this, the model had mailed the police officer and took his threat on record
 iske baad police afasar ne is maamle par puri tarah chuppi saadh lee kyonki use pataa tha ki sach saamne aa jayega
 The lawyer said that after this incident, his client (model) busted the sex racket at his expense without the help of the police and apprehended the people involved
 iske baad police kii duty thi ki wo aropiyon ko giraftaar kare or giroh main shaamil ladakiyon main se ek ko pakade
 Was Parskar implicated? After this the model sent several messages to Parskar requesting that the news should not be leaked to the media in any way so that the image of the model is not damaged
 lekin iske baavjood parskar ne yah khabar media ko li kar di
 Even Parskar wanted to make the matter known by holding a press conference
 notice ke mutabik parskar apni publicity ke liye is model ke naam or image kaa durupyog karne koshish main the
 He claims to have enough evidence to support the model's allegations
 notice main siddiki ne daawa kiya tha ki unki muvakkil ne 8 janvari 2014 ko shaam 4 baje tatkaaleen police kamishnar satyapal singh se milakar parskar ke khilaaf shikaayat karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 When it came to the audience, they called the model and her sister to their office and tried to prove their innocence by pleading in front of both
 vahiin, model ne parskar se kaha ki wo punam pandeya ke kehane par jaan-boojhkar uskaa naam or image kharaab kar rahe hai
 Parskar vowed even to his son to prove his innocence
 parskar par aarope he ki unhone model se kareebi badhaane kii koshish kii or unhone kai mail or massej bheje
 Parskar also called the model to meet at a coffee shop and other places
 vakil kaa daawa he ki is bare main unki muvakkil ke paas paryaapt saboot hai

 ) Former Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee is turning 92 on 25 December
 apane samay main atal desh ke behad lokapriy netaaon main se ek rahe
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee is known for his political understanding as well as his speech style and poetry
 aaie jaanate he atal bihari vaajapeyi ke jivan ke kuch ankahe tathy
 
 
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee was always in the spotlight with his spot response on the taunt of Indira Gandhi
 ek baar jab sansad main indira gandhi ne charchaa ke dauraan vaajapeyi ke bare main kaha ki wo hitler kii tarah bhaashan dete hai or haath laharaa-laharaa kar apni baat rakhte hai
 Replying to this later, Atal said that 'indira ji, everyone gives a speech by shaking hands, have you ever heard anyone giving a speech while shaking his leg?' Only a person like Indira Gandhi could show courage to give such an answer
 pehle inhen paar lagaao, phir mujhepatrkaar satyapal choudhary ne ek lekh main likhaa he ki sitambar 1992 main jab jammu ke paas akhnur main chenab nadi main baadh ai thi tab vahaan kaa nadi kaa pul bah gaya tha
 Atal then came to visit the region
 nadi paar jane ke liye sena motor boat se logon ko le jaati, jab atal yahaan daura karne aae to unke saath party netaa bhi aae
 When Atal sat in the boat, the army men said that a total of 4 people can sit in the boat, on hearing this, Atal got down from the boat and said that first cross them, then take me
 holi ke divaane atal ne nahin manaai holiatal bihari vaajapeyi ko holi khilne kaa bahut shok tha, vah hameshaa holi ke samay party daftar yaa ghar main jashn main shariq hote the
 In 2002, Vajpayee came to Nainital Raj Bhavan to stay for a few days after the earthquake in Bhuj and Kutch in Gujarat
 march main holi ke aasapaas vahaan kuch dinon tak rahe par holi nahin manaai, bas vahaan rahakar kuch kavitaayen likhi
 It is a matter of shame that Atal Bihari Vajpayee studied law with his father
 kanpur ke diavi college main pita-putr donon ek saath padhate the
 Both of them earned a law degree in the same class, during which both also stayed in hostels together
 atal kaa tha ek or namasabhi ke chahete atal bihari vaajapeyi ko unke kareebi dost or rishtedaar 'baap ji' kahkar bulaate the
 At the same time, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, during a speech in Rajya Sabha, described him as the 'bhishma Pitamah' of Indian politics
 atal bihari vaajapeyi bhartiya sangeet or nrity ke shaukeen the, vahiin chhuttiyon main ghoomane ke liye vah aksar manali jaaya karte the

 Tejashwi told Nitish Kumar that he was not in a government post when he was accused
 aise main prevension of karppashan act main wo kaise doshi hai
 Tejashwi also told that he will go to court against the CBI case and appeal for anticipatory bail

 If bail is granted or if the court finishes the case then what will be the meaning of resignation
 tal gaya tejasvi kaa istifabataya ja rahaa he ki tejasvi yadav kii in daleelon ke baad unka istipha philhal tal gaya he
 Now, based on the decision of the court, any action will be taken against Tejashwi
 isse pehle ek baar jediu argedy pramukh lalu prasad yadav ko hathdharmi chhodte hue gathbandhan dharm kaa paalan karne kii naseehat de chuki he

 The RJD believes that the corruption charges against Tejashwi Yadav are not so serious as to resign from the post

 saatven vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko kendra sarkaar kii manjuuri mili 7 maheene se juyada samay biit chukaa he or kendra sarkaar ke karmchaariyon ko iskaa puri tarah se phayda pahunchane main abhi bhi deree he
 The challenge before the central government is to provide increased salary to 47 lakh central employees and increased pension to 53 lakh pensioners
 1
 In the 2016 annual budget, the central government had made a provision of Rs 70,000 crore to implement the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission
 vahiin vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko puri tarah lagu karne ke liye kendra sarkaar ko 1
 02 lakh crores is needed
 lekin beete 14 maheenon kii badi hui selary bataur arier intjaar karte karmchaariyon kii maang ko puraa karne main sabase badi dikkat kendra sarkaar ke notebandi ke faisle se baad paidaa hui he
 2
 vetan ayogki siforeeshon ko manjuuri dene ke baad kendra sarkaar ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki sabhi karmchaariyon ko janvari 1, 2016 se badi hui selary or bhatta milegaa lekin notebandi lagu hone ke baad kendra sarkaar is mudde par aakhri faisla lene se kataraa rahi he
 3
 notebandi kaa faisla lene ke baad modi sarkaar ne kendriya karmchaariyon ke bhatte par vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko dekhne ke liye ek cameti gathit kar di
 This committee has also been asked to pave the way for implementing the recommendations of the Pay Commission
 4
 According to sources, the committee headed by Ashok Lavasa has prepared its report but the central government is not able to give allowance to the employees as the cash shortage in the country is also troubling the central government
 5
 Seventh Pay Commission 138 in HRA
 71 fisadi ijapha kiya he or anya bhatte main 49
 It has proposed a 79 percent increase
 6
 During the last few months, the union of central government employees has been pressing the Finance Ministry to make payments at the earliest
 karmchaaree union apni maang ko lekar strike par jane kii baat kar rahi he
 7
 chunaav ayog ke nirdesh or 5 rajyon main chunaav prakriya shuru hone ke baad ab kendra sarkaar karmchaariyon ke bhatte par koi faisle nahin le sakati
 Therefore, it is expected that now the Central employees have no option but to wait till the completion of the election process
 8
 Due to the election, the central government will refrain from making any announcement related to the Seventh Pay Commission in the upcoming budget
 lihaaja, chunaav prakriya khatm hone ke baad kendra sarkaar ko alag se saatven vetan ayog kaa phayda karmchaariyon tak pahunchane ke liye fund kaa intjaam karnaa hoga

 greg chapel kabhi bharat ke coach the lekin unhone ab na sirf bhartiya cricket team balki bhartiya samskruti ko lekar bhi jehar ugala he
 He says that Indian teams cannot produce good leaders because parents, school teachers and coaches make all decisions in the Indian system
 chapel ne kaha, ‘bhartiya samskruti ekadam bhinn he
 This is not a team culture
 unke paas team main netritvkartaaon kii kami he
 From a young age their parents make all the decisions
 unke schuli shikshak unke sabhi faisle lete hai or unke coach unke faisle karte hai
 Comments unhone kaha, ‘bharat main is tarah kii samskruti he ki aap koi apana sir uthaakar baat karata he to koi aap par baras padegaa
 So they learn by lowering their head and do not take responsibility
 ’ crickinfo ke anusaar chapel ne apni kitaab ‘fyres focus’ ke prachaar kaarykram ke dauraan kaha, ‘pomes (angrej) ne vastav main unhen sir nicha karnaa sikhaaya tha
 If someone was deemed responsible, he was punished, so the Indians learned to refrain from taking responsibility
 isliye kisi bhi faisle kii jimmedaari lene se pehle ve usase bachane ko praathamikta dete hai
 Chappell said that Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni seems to be an exception but it seems that he too has become a victim of this system
 bhartiya team ke 2005 se 2007 tak coach rahe chapel ne kaha ki bahut adhik cricket kaa dhoni par asar dikhne laga he
 He said, 'but upon seeing her on this tour, i did not talk to her nor did i meet her, but seeing her mere gestures on the field, i did not feel that this is the same MS Dhoni i know
 main samajhataa hum ki bhartiya cricket kaa boj us par baari pad rahaa he
 The former Australian captain also said that during the recent tour of Australia, Indians did not show interest in Test cricket
 chapel kaa iske saath hi maananaa he ki virendra sahvaag kii captain banane kii mahatvakanksha se bhi team ko nuksaan hua
 He said, 'sehwag feels that he should have become the captain after (anil) Kumble, so some differences arose there
 ’ He said, 'india has such a culture that if you raise your head and talk, then someone will shower you
 isliye ve apana sir nicha karke sikhte hai or jimmedaari nahin lete hai
 According to Cricinfo, Chappell said during the promotional program of his book 'fires Focus',' The Poms (englishmen) had actually taught him to lower his head
 yadi kisi ko jimmedaar samajha jaataa tha to use sajaa milti thim isliye bharatiyon ne jimmedaari lene se bachanaa siikhaa
 So before taking responsibility for any decision they prefer to avoid it
 ’ chapel ne kaha ki bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni apwaad lagata he lekin lagata he ki vah bhi is vyavastha kaa shikaar ban gaya he
 Chappell, who was the coach of the Indian team from 2005 to 2007, said that much of cricket has started affecting Dhoni
 unhone kaha, ‘lekin is daure main use dekhne par, maine usase baat nahin kii or naa hi main usase mila, lekin maidan par keval uske haav bhav dekhakar mujhe nahin laga ki yah vahi emes dhoni he jise main jaanata hum
 i think the burden of Indian cricket is falling on him
 ’ is purv austrailian captain ne iske saath hi kaha ki australia ke haal ke daure main bharatiyon main test cricket ke prati dilchaspee nahin dikhi
 Chappell also believes that Virender Sehwag's ambition to become captain also hurt the team
 unhone kaha, ‘sahvaag ko lagata he ki (anil) kumble ke baad use captain bananaa chahie tha isliye vahaan kuch matbhed paidaa ho gayi
 ' bhartiya team ke 2005 se 2007 tak coach rahe chapel ne kaha ki bahut adhik cricket kaa dhoni par asar dikhne laga he
 He said, 'but upon seeing her on this tour, i did not talk to her nor did i meet her, but seeing her mere gestures on the field, i did not feel that this is the same MS Dhoni i know

 However, due to the increased vigilance at the ground border, smuggling has been largely stopped on this route
 sthaneey log in dinon gaay taskaron kii amanviya harkaton ke virodh main khul kar saamne aane lage hai
 According to the local people, these smugglers are so fearless that when stopped they sometimes even confront the BSF

 It may be known that the Special Investigation Team till date had opened up many layers of cow smuggling last year by turning to Assam with intelligence cameras

 Reliance Infocom's telecom service Jio subscriber base 7, launched on September 5 last year
 24 karod ho gaya he
 Many new customers are joining the company due to free calling and data service
 pichley maheene ek report main daawa kiya gaya tha ki march ke ant tak reliance jeeyo ke paas 10 karod graahak honge
 It is believed that the real examination of the company will start after March 31
 ho saktaa he ki 31 march se kuch samay pehle kaaphi graahak jeeyo ke sim band kar den
 People are getting free internet and calling right now
 kaha to yah bhi ja rahaa he ki jaise hi company apni sevaaon ke liye paise lenaa shuru karegi, graahakon kii sankhya kam bhi hogi
 Right now all services including data and voice calls of the company are free till March 2017
 ullekhneey he ki reliance industries ke maalik mukesh ambani ne sitambar 2016 main apni mobile sarvice laanch kii thi
 Then the company announced to provide free calling and data service by 31 December

 (know, in which case Airtel beat Reliance Jio) sabhi ko reliance ke new year plan par bhi aapatti thi jis par tri ne apana faisla sunaate hue kaha ki isamen koi dikkat nahin he
 Now it is worth noting that after March 31, when Reliance will bring the new plan again, what will happen to other companies
 yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki baaki companiyaan kaisaa plan badlaav karti hai

 For information, let us know that other companies in the market faced a lot of difficulty due to Reliance's free service
 un sab ko apane data charge se lekar colling charge kam karne pade
 Everyone had to make a new plan, as well as the problem of call drop on the calls coming from the Reliance network on the network of all the companies
 isaki shikaayat hui or tri ne anya companiyon ko chetavanee bhi di
 Apart from this, other companies also went to TRAI and complained to Reliance
 (jaaniye, reliance jeeyo ko janvari main kis maamle main airtel ne pachhad diya) Everyone objected to Reliance's New Year plan, on which TRAI, while giving its decision, said that there is no problem in it
 ab gaur karne kii baat yah he ki 31 march ke baad jab reliance phir nae plan ko laaegaa tab anya companiyon kaa kya hoga
 It will be interesting to see how the rest of the companies make plan changes

 jahaan ek mahila ne apane bete ke saath milakar apane suhaag kaa khun kar diya
 Not only this, both of them buried the corpse in the house to hide this incident
 jab kai din tak mritak duusare rishtedaaron ko dikhaai nahin diya to unhone police ko soochna di
 The case is related to Jeetpur Negi village of Devalchod Chowki area of haldwani Kotwali
 jahaan pyarelal apane parivaar ke saath rahata tha
 On Monday, the police went to his house and dug into a room with hard work for 3 hours
 is khudaai main police ko ekbujurg kii lashmili, jo ki chaar-paanch din puraani lag rahi thi
 The police investigation revealed that the deceased was none other than the owner of this house, Pyarelal
 iske baad is katl kii kahani se jab pardaa uthaa to sunne vaale hairaan rah gaye
 In fact, Pyarelal's brother Babulal called from his house in Rampur, UP to inquire about his brother's skillful news
 lekin babulal ko apni bhabhi or bhattije se pyarelal kii koi khabar nahin mili
 Babulal suspected something
 vah apane bhai kaa haal chaal jaanane rampur se haldwani aayaa or gaanv main jaakar usne apni bhabhi or bhattije se bhai ke bare main poocha to unhone taalamatoli kii or bataaya ki pyarelal kahin chalaa gaya he
 Babulal was surprised that his brother Plarelal was 70 years old
 vah zyada chal phir nahin saktaa tha
 Now his suspicion was strengthened
 lihaaja vah haldwani kotwali pahunchaa or apni bhabhi or bhattije ke khilaaf pyarelal ko gaayab karne kii report darj kara di
 Acting on Babulal's complaint, the police detained Pyarelal's wife and son
 jab un donon se police ne kadai se poochtacha kii to sara raaj khul gaya
 Pyarelal often quarreled with his son and wife
 isi jhagade kii vajah se pyarelal ko maa-bete ne milakar maar daalaa
 And to hide the crime, his body was buried in the house
 police ne aaropee bete kii nishandehi par ghar ke andar 4 feet khudaai kar pyarelal kaa shav baraamad kar liya
 Simultaneously, the Kotwali police registered a case under sections 302 and 201 of IPC against the deceased Rani Devi, wife of Pyarelal, and son Munnalal for murder and concealment of bodies

 He shared a post in which his lawyer Ravi Naik and his son can be seen
 apane is post ke sahare unhone ghoshnaa kii thi ki ve legal ection lene ja rahi hai
 She wrote, i was dropped from the Miss World contest despite winning the title of Miss Ukraine because i am married and the mother of a child
 unhone aage kaha ki mujhe apana crown waapas nahin chahie
 i want to change its rules so that women can benefit from it on a large scale
 ye niyam international policy kii tarah bana die gaye hai jo kahin naa kahin duniya bhar kii kai mahilaon ke khilaaf bhedbhaav ko darshaate hai
 The 24-year-old model wrote that i want to request Miss World and similar global beauty events to remove these stereotypical rules so that these contests can represent every woman present in society
 View this post on instagramdear friends, i am happy to share the exciting news with you
 Today # righttobeamother has made a huge leap forward
 i have launched a legal challenge against @missworld and this marks the new phase in our joint fight for justice
 ⠀ i am proud to be represented by Ravi Naik, Human Rights Lawyer of the Year 2018, and Leading Counsel Marie Demitriou QC
 Ravi represents clients in some of the world’s most high profile cases
 This includes the first case against # cambridgeanalytica for political profiling and claims against Facebook for their data practices
 Marie Demitriou was a barrister on the legal team acting for South African athlete Caster Semenya who was subjected to sex testing following her victory at the 2009 World Championships
 ⠀ We say that under the # equalityact 2010 the entry policy operated by # missworld is discriminatory on various grounds, namely marital status, and pregnancy and maternity
 The Equality Act protects against discrimination based on certain characteristics, including marriage, maternity and sex
 The reason i was not allowed to compete in Miss World after winning the title # missukraine is because i had been married and have a child
 Denying me the chance of competing on those bases breaches those protections against discrimination
 Don't i don't want the crown back
 i want to get the rules changed for wider society
 These rules are a systemic, widespread and international policy that results in discrimination on large scale across many countries
 ⠀ This year the 69th Miss World Final returns to London on 14 December 2019
 We believe it is the right moment for @missworld to introduce the change
 ⠀ i am really glad to see that our story has resonated with the UK national media such as @dailymail, @telegraph, @thesun, @skynews, @thetimes, @bbcnews, @bbcnewsbeat, @dailymirror🌍 ⠀ Photo credit: David mchugh / Brighton picturesa post shared byveronika Didusenko(@veronika_didusenko) onnov 30, 2019 at 7:08am pstbawa den ki unhen pichley saal miss ukraine 2018 ke crown se nawaja gaya tha lekin chaar dinon baad hi unase unka tital chin liya gaya tha jab is pratiyogita ke mekars ko pataa chalaa tha ki unka ek baccha he
 According to the rules, women who have children cannot participate in the Miss World contest
 veronica ne mana ki unhone niyamon ko padhaa tha lekin unhone ye bhi kaha ki unka baccha kisi bhi haal main unke profeshnal kariyar main baadha nahin he or ye ek behad dakiyanoosee niyam he
 He said that we are trying to spread awareness among people due to the # righttobemother campaign

 dilli kiek adalatane kaha he ki beemaa policy main kisi mahila ko apni patni ke taur par pesh karnaa yah sabit karne ke liye vaid saboot nahin he ki vyakti us mahila se vivaahit he
 Additional District Judge Rajendra Kumar Shastri gave this arrangement while dismissing the petition of a woman from Delhi
 mahila ne adaalat se is aadhaar par apane vivaah ko amaanya karne kii maang kii thi ki us purush se uskaa vivaah kabhi hua hi nahin tha kyonki ek mahila se uskaa pehle hi vivaah ho chukaa tha or is mahila kaa naam beemaa policy main uski patni ke taur par darj tha
 Dismissing the petition of this woman living in Khanpur, South Delhi, the court said, 'although it is proved that the defendant has introduced another woman as his wife in his LIC policy, it is not proved that She (nominee woman) is his legally married wife
 ’ adaalat ne haalanki is vivaah ke astitv ko asweekaar karne kii maang ko khaarij kar diya lekin mahila ke is aagrah ko sweekaar kar liya ki krurta or parityag ke aadhaar par use talaak diya jaae
 The court, while sanctioning the woman's divorce last week, said that her husband had voluntarily abandoned her and had not even responded to the court notice when the woman filed for divorce
 adaalat ne yah bhi kaha ki yah vyakti mahila ke mata-pita se apana vyapaar badhaane ke naam par dahej kii maang kar rahaa tha
 The court said, 'it is well established that it was the defendant who left his house for no reason
 isi prakaar sharaab ke nashe main akaaran peetna or apane vyapaar ko behatar banane ke liye do lakh rupee nakad diye jane kii maang karnaa krurta he
 According to Hindu tradition, the court ordered this on 21 June 2007 on the divorce petition of the married woman
 mahila ne hindu vivaah adhinium ke tahat krurta ke aadhaar par talaak kii maang karte hue apane vivaah ko amaanya karwaane kaa aagrah kiya tha
 According to the Act, second marriage is illegal and invalid in the event of first marriage
 mahila ne apni yachika main kaha ki uske pati ne apana kaarobaar badhaane ke naam par usase do lakh rupee laane kii maang kii thi lekin jab uske pita ne asamarthta jataayi to usne use buree tarah peeta
 For Lalu Prasad Yadav, the start of the new year cannot be worse
 bihar ke chaara ghotaale ke maamalon main se ek main unhen chah janvari ko saadhe teen varsh jail kii sajaa sunai gai he, par rashtriya janata dal supremeo ko sheeghra raahat milane ke asaar nahin hai
 The trial is scheduled to be completed in three more cases related to the scam in three months
 kanoonee visheshgy kehete hai ki pratikul faislon se musiibat main fanse is netaa ke liye oonchi adaalaton se jamaanat paanaa asambhav lagata he
 And this difficulty is not just for Lalu Yadav
 jis din sibiai adaalat ne unhen doshi tehraaya, usee subah pravartan nideshaalay ne unki badi beti or rajyasabha sadsy misa bharti ke khilaaf mani landring maamle main aaropapatr daakhil kiya
 His wife Rabri Devi is currently silent
 vahiin chote putr tejasvi hotel ke liye jameen ghotaale main sibiai ke cese kaa saamana kar rahe hai, yah maamla lalu yadav ke upie-1 sarkaar main rail mantri rahane ke samay kaa he
 Now the real fear is that constant legal challenges may derail the RJD
 lekin lalu ko khaarij karnaa abhi jaldbaaji hogi, unamem vaapasi karne kii vilakshan kshamta he
 Just six months after he was first convicted (september 2013) in the fodder scam case, Lalu tied up with the Congress to block Narendra Modi's chariot and won six seats in the 2014 general election
 ek varsh baad unhone bihar vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ko parrast karne ke liye nitish kumaar se saare matbhed bhula die
 His party became the single largest party with 80 mlas in the 243-seat assembly
 rajd netritv lalu ko jail kii sajaa ko jatigat purvaagrah se prerit bataa rahaa he
 RJD leaders are already questioning the conviction of former Chief Minister Jagannath Mishra and punishment of Lalu in this case
 logon ko yahi samajhane ke liye tejasvi yadav ne 14 janvari ke baad rajya ke daure kii yojana banaai he, jisamen ve rajd ke yadav or muslim matadaataaon tak pahunchenge
 Party leaders are hopeful that supporters will see Lalu's punishment as political harassment
 lekin ve yah bhi jaanate hai ki ab nitish rajg ke kheme main hai, aise main rajd kii sambhaavna bahut kuch is baat par nirbhar karti he ki rahul gandhi ke netritv main congress party ke saath kis tarah pesh aati he
 On-the-ground reports suggest that Lalu Yadav's punishment in the second case of the fodder scam has had no effect on his muslim-yadav supporters
 haalanki kuch samay ke liye saarvajanik jivan se unki anupasthiti bihar kii raajnneeti main ek bade shunya kaa kaaran banegi
 Son Tejashwi and Tej Pratap have to do a lot before taking the place of father
 unke liye ekmaatr raahat yah he ki 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav abhi ek varsh dur he
 But will this be enough time for the party to retaliate? deshadroh ke aarope main giraftaar jeenyu chaatr sangh ke adhyaksh kanhaiya kumaar ko shuukravaar ko do hafte kii nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya gaya he
 Delhi Police said that he no longer needed to take Kanhaiya Kumar into custody
 kanhaiya kumaar ab dilli ke tihaad jail main rahegaa
 He is currently the most sensitive prisoner in terms of security inside the jail
 uski suraksha aisi kii gai he ki parinda bhi par nahin maar mayega
 According to the exclusive information received till date, every possible precaution is being taken with respect to Kanhaiya's safety
 na sirf use alag cell main rakhaa ja rahaa he, balki khaane-pine kii jaanch se lekar uske cell par har pal sisitivi kii nigaraanee rakhi ja rahi he
 He is kept in a separate cell in jail number three in Tihar
 yahaan jail staff ke saath hi tamilnadu special police kii 24 ghante nigahabaani main usko rakhaa gaya he
 CCTV cameras are being kept with no security in the eyes of the eyewitness so all the staff deployed have been given strict instructions
 uske cell par na sirf sisitivi camere kii najar he, balki 4 jail karmchaaree 24 ghante us cell kii suraksha kar rahe hai
 There is an order to increase security if Kanhaiya is taken out of the cell and taken anywhere inside the jail for any reason
 usase kisi se milane kii baat to chhodie, aasapaas anya kaidi ko bhatakane tak kii ijaajat nahin he
 The Tihar Jail Administration is fully prepared because the reason for this is that there is a risk of attack on him, one can also abuse him
 kisi medical zarurat kii haalat main cell main hi doctor bhejne kaa aadesh he
 Along with this, deputy superintendent of jail number three has also been asked to visit Kanhaiya twice every day
 yani suraksha ko lekar tihaad jail main jail prashasan se koi bhi chook ho, usase pehle hi unke dwaara tamaam saavdhaaniyaan barat lee gayi hai

 There is a question all over the country - one about rape, one justice
 kareeb 15 dinon se chal rahaa he ye sawaal
 For the first time, police are showering flowers on the encounter
 kya ye insaaf tha
 Have people lost their confidence in the court
 aaj hi ke din nirbhaya cese jaisaa jaghanya aparaadh bhi hua tha
 But the culprits have not yet been punished

 police kii karrwai main deree se hoti he insaaf milane main dereeh usha meharapurv hoicourt jaj usha mehara ne kaha ki log insaaf milane main deree se dukhi he
 Not from the court or the justice process

 Staff in police stations is low, how both should be handled: Former Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar Former Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar said that there should be separate departments of investigation and prosecution
 isse phayda hona chahie
 The Law and Order wing and the investigation wing must be separate
 ye supreme court kaa order he
 But usually there are six to seven inspectors at the police station
 yaa kul milakar 25-30 staff hote hai
 Suppose the whole team has to go in some event, but the investigation wing will say that we will not go, then it will be difficult
 itane kam staff se kaise lau and order or jaanch donon kaise hoga
 Why did it take seven years for the police to make all the mistake: Neeraj Kumar Former Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar said that today it has been 7 years for the Nirbhaya case
 nirbhaya cese main hamane 10 din main chargeshit file kar di thi
 It took seven years for the police to be responsible for the decision
 hamane saare saboot die
 If all the blame is from the police, if all the shortcomings are from the police, then why is the case taking seven years
 ye hamaari aadat he ki ham ek paksh par saare aarope laga dete hai to kaam aasaan ho jaataa he
 The Nirbhaya case is a case study, we should know where the delay occurred: Neeraj Kumar How can we divide a police officer in the investigation wing or law and order
 meraa kahana he ki staff kam he
 If there is a big uproar in the city, then who will manage if there is no staff
 lekin kanoonee prakriya itani dhimi ho jaati he usase dikkat aati he
 i am saying the general point that Nirbhaya should be considered a case study
 ki aakhir itani der kahaan hui
 We should find this delay

 Nurses had a residence and work place on this floor

 In Mosul, they were asked to get off the bus in a batch of ten

 "they gave khubj (roti), lentils and cheese to the nurses

 'army's life is not easy
 
 
 
 'no one can deny this fact
 phogiyon ko na keval visham paristhitiyon kaa saamana karnaa hota he, balki lambey samay tak yaa phir anischitkaal ke liye unhen apane parivaar se bhi dur rahanaa padataa he
 The army officers as well as their family members have to make sacrifices, which is not easy
 or jab faujee desh ke liye nyochhavar ho jaataa he, to parivaar ko bhi apana sarvocch tyaag dena padataa he
 The story of the sacrifice of Salma, the wife of martyr Captain Shafiq Ghori, also shocks the hearts
 salama ne fasebuk pej biingyu par apni kahani share kii he
 Shaheed Shafiq Ghori's wife Salma was married at the age of 19, but at the age of 29, Salma lost her sweetheart
 captain shafiq jammu-kashmir main aatankiyon se loha lete hue shahid ho gaye the
 In her post, Salma has written that her married life was of short duration but was brilliant
 salama or shafiq dar roj ek duusare ko khat likhaa karte the
 But it was unfortunate that Salma received her last letter when she came to know that Shafiq was sacrificed for the sake of the country
 baad main salama ko kai logon ne jindagi main aage bad jane kii salaah di, lekin salama ne aisa nahin kiya or shafiq ke liye jeene kii thaan lee
 Salma has written that Captain Shafiq was his, and will always be his
 maujuuda samay main salama shahid phogiyon ke parivaar ke kalyaan or mahila shashaktikaran ke liye karnataka main kaam karti hai
 The story of Salma, who shakes her heart, has gone viral on social media
 log sirf salama kii tarif hi nahin kar rahe hai, balki khud ko unki kahani se jod rahe hai
 So far, more than 28 thousand people have shared Salma's post
 padhie salama kii fasebuk post - On Monday, criminals shot a woman in outer Delhi
 ghayal mahila aspataal main bhartee he
 The woman and her husband were also shot on October 7 this month
 us ghatana main pati kii maut ho gai thi or mahila ghayal thi
 The same woman was shot again on Monday
 mahila kii haalat gambhir he auramaharshi balmiki aspataalmen bhartee he
 In fact, the woman of Jyotinam had escaped death in the firing that took place on October 7 this month, and now she came home after the situation improved
 somvaar ko uske ghar par phir kisi ne achaanakaphiringkar di
 The bullet hit the woman's face
 mahila kii haalat gambhir bani hui he
 People around have no idea about who was shot, who came from which car
 kisi ne bhi is mudde par bolne se manaa kar diya
 The woman is admitted to a nearby hospital
 uski haalat abhi bhi gambhir bani hui he
 It is not yet clear why bullets are being fired on this family repeatedly
 mahila ke pati kii maut ho chuki he
 There was no looting even in the previous firing
 taaja ghatana main bhi koi lutpaat nahin hui he
 The attackers simply shoot and escape
 philhal bavana thana police pichhali ghatana kaa cese solve bhi nahin kar pai he or ab phir dobaaraa se usee mahila par hamalaa ho gaya he
 It is being feared that the woman has been interracially married, so both of them have been targeted
 puraa gaanv is maamle main kuch bhi bolne se batch rahaa he or na hi koi police ke saamne bayaan de rahaa he
 The firing remains a puzzle

 He made it clear that this rule would also apply to trains coming from outside Delhi
 saath hi unka kahana he ki ye niyam ravivaar ko lagu nahin hoga
 In fact, there is a constant response to the issue of aud-even numbers of vehicles in Delhi
 dilli ke grih mantri satyendra jain ne kaha he ki ye niyam sirf privet kaaron par lagu hoga
 Also, this rule will not apply to two-wheelers and autos

 aap aankadon ko kai tareeke se dekh sakate hai
 An old but fascinating saying about the figures is that they are like bikinis that expose interesting things but hide the basic things

 None of these definitions, however, apply to the data on agricultural statistics in a poor country that falls in the $ 1,500 category of per capita income

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi too has been right of late, but it is understood that Indian politics first belongs to the farmer and it does not matter whether his contribution to the country's GDP is below 15 percent or just 15 percent
 is
 bhartiya raajnneeti ke bare main kuch itnaa sidhaa nahin he jitna uskaa kisaanon ke saath antarnihit rishta
 Today it is being celebrated that India's GDP during the financial year 2014-157

 bharat ke paas salanaa vruddhi dar ke maamle main china ko peeche chhodie kaa pehla avasar aa gaya he
 Despite this, the government has some concerns and the markets are responding in the same way
 bharat aaj sabase teji se badhati hui arthvyavastha he jahaan mudrasphiti neeche aa rahi he, epadi main ijapha ho rahaa he or byaaj daren gir rahi hai, iske baavjood sabake chehre sapaat dikh rahe hai
 The opposition that has reached the cipher is suddenly starting to see a crown while the government seems to be surrounded
 raajnneeti aakhir aarthik sanketakon kii nafarmani kaise kar sakati he? iskaa jawaab kheti main he, is tathy main ki bharat bhale hi ab ek krishi chaalit arthvyavastha nahin rah jayega lekin yahaan kii siyasat ab bhi kheti hi tay karti he
 Let's try to understand it
 pichley saal jab bharat 7

 Total growth rate in the year before it

 9 fisadi rahi thi or is lihaaj se krishi ke khate main ai 3
 The 6 percent growth rate cannot be called very bad
 agar aap 2012-13 main 1
 Combining the growth rate of 5 percent, the average rate of increase in agricultural production in three years is 1
 7 fisadi nikal kar aegi jo ki kul rashtriya vruddhi dar se teen-chauthai peeche rah jaati he
 This is the key figure that reflects rural plight and complicates politics in the early days of Modi's tenure
 udyog chaalit vruddhi kaa har dam baaja bajaane waalon ke liye yah bhraamak sthiti he
 The author also puts himself in the same category
 sabhi teji se badhati vikasshil arthvyavasthaaon kii hi tarah bharat ke jidipi main bhi krishi kii hissedari giri he jabaki sevaaon or utpaadan kii badi he
 It should also be so
 isse kya fark padataa he ki krishi sankat main he, aapako to zyada se zyada logon ko aarthik moolyahras se baahar nikaalkar zyada utpaadak kaamon main lagaana he
 This is where it comes to urbanization and industrialization
 yah kisaanon kii jameen ke adhigrahan ke liye kanoon ko halkaa banane kaa acha tark muhaiyaa karata he

 Ashok Gulati, India's leading scholar on agrarian economy and markets and Professor of Infosys Chair at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations in New Delhi, estimates that 49 per cent of India's workforce is engaged in farming
 gramin pariwaron kaa ausat aakaar bada hota he, lihaaja iskaa arth yah nikalataa he ki koi 55-60 fisadi aabaadi kheti par nirbhar he
 Now reverse the equation: half the workforce produces one-seventh of GDP and nearly two-thirds of India depends on it
 mote taur par iskaa matlab yah hua ki duusare jitna ausatan kamaate hai, ek kisaan uske chauthai se bhi kam kamata he
 Now you have 1 of agriculture in three years against the total growth rate of 6 percent of the economy
 7 fisadi kii ausat vruddhi dar ko rakhkar dekhen
 The whole picture of rural plight will appear before you
 bhartiya krishi kii meri samaj banane main mujhe madad karne vaale ashok gulati kehete hai ki krishi kshetra main vruddhi duusare tamaam kshetron ke yoga ke mukaable garibi ko do se teen guna zyada teji se dur karti he
 According to the 2008 World Development Report, this ratio of agricultural growth and poverty reduction in China is three and a half times and in South America it is 2
 7 guna he
 When you see more than half of the population passing at less than one-seventh of the national income, then it is understandable that most of the people in this area are actually poor
 krishi ke mahatv par arthshaastriyon ke bich mote taur par do dharaaen hai
 One is represented by my old friend and prolific columnist Surjit Bhalla, who attributes depreciation in agriculture to the fact that in any period of time in large economies, the agricultural sector has not been able to achieve a growth rate of more than 4 per cent
 doosraa dhada gulati kaa he jo poochta he ki aisa kyon nahin ho saktaa
 In China, agriculture doubled from 1978 to 1984, an early phase of economic reforms
 yahaan ek badhibia sawaal yah khadaa hota he ki agar chaar fisadi kii ausat dar se paar janaa naammumkin he to phir bharat ke kam se kam paanch rajya pichley ek dashak se aisa kaise kar paa rahe hai? ye paanchon rajya kai deshon se zyada bade hai

 The intervening Maharashtra is tired of the congress-ncp rule and with a 2% thorn, you can call Uttar Pradesh a state with a secular rate in terms of agricultural growth (on the lines of the old Hindu growth rate), which has Has not been re-elected in the last decade

 My central theory on the relationship of agriculture and politics is built on this basis
 yahi vajah he ki iske saath kii talika ek audyogikrut or shahrikrut hote bharat main rajnatik kismat ko aankane kaa itnaa jaanaleva nuskhaa he
 Agriculture's share in GDP may be below 15 per cent, but its share of GDP and elections is about 60 per cent of GDP
 mjedaar baat yah he ki rahul gandhi or modi, donon ko hi yah baat samaj main aa chuki he
 It is for this reason that Rahul's entire campaign is focused on the rural crisis and by linking the land bill with him, he has given a momentum to the national discourse, which has revived the dead opposition
 bharat main do fasalein pehle hi kharaab ho chuki hai or agar sookhe kii bhavishyavaanee sahi nikalati he to teesraa kaa munh bhi ham dekh lenge
 Rahul is playing accordingly
 yahi vajah he ki lambey samay baad sabase tej siyaasi shakhsiyat ke taur par ubhare modi bhi apni patari badal chuke hai
 On the first anniversary of the government, you have a look at his speeches and interviews
 sari baat gramin bharat, garibon or kisaanon par kii gai hai
 In Mathura, he even said that the bourgeoisie, Dhanna Seth, does not provide employment while the younger man does it
 is saal kul 7
 0 against a growth rate of 3 per cent and an average growth rate of 6 per cent in three years
 2 fisadi kii krishi vruddhi dar or teen saal main 1
 The average agricultural growth rate of 7 is proving far more inevitable
 aisa isliye kyonki ham siyaasi jidipi kii baat kar rahe hai, aankadon kii nahin

 haalanki, bhojanavkaash ke baad peeth ne vidhansabha adhyaksh ke vakil abhishek manu singhvi se kaha ki aadesh subah main hi jari kar diya gaya he or unki arji baagi vidhayakon kii yachika ke saath shuukravaar ko suni jaaegi
 Meanwhile, Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy rejected the bjp's demand for his resignation
 unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'main istipha kyon duun? abhi mere istipha dene kii kya jarurat he?' vidhansabha adhyaksh kumaar ne niyamon se bandhe hone kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki vah ek uchit faisla lenge, jo kuch logon ko suvidhajanak to kuch ko asuvidhajanak lag saktaa he
 He also said that the apex court has asked him not to decide in any particular way
 kumaar ne baagi vidhayakon se milane ke baad kaha ki aaj kii mulaakaat kii videography kii gai or ise supreme court register general ko bheja jayega
 Kumar said, 'should i work at lightning speed? For whom? What will happen to the rules, people? i am just following the constitution
 
 
 main hadabadi main kaam nahin kar rahaa
 i owe it to the people of the state and the constitution
 ' unhone kaha ki adaalat ne mujhase jald faisla karne ko kaha he, maine unhen (ucchtam nyaayalay) likhaa he ki "tatkaal" shabd jiskaa ullekh kiya gaya he, use main samaj nahin paa rahaa hum- kya faisla karnaa he, kyonki samvidhan kuch or kahata he, isiilie maine unhen (vidhayakon ko) upasthit hone kaa samay diya
 He also emphasized that he is neither responsible for the current political situation nor responsible for its outcome
 chhattisgarh main garmi shuru hone ke saath hi kabhi bacchon ke haathon main patang najar aatin thim, lekin haal ke dinon main ab mobile or computer ne patang udaane kii dilchaspee ko kam kar diya he
 Kite market has also cooled down earlier
 ab ginati ke bachche hi patang kharidne dukaan par pahunchate hai, aise main dukandaaron main bhi vyavsaay ko lekar ruchi nahin rah gai he
 Bharti Yadav of Rajdhani says that in the months of march-april a few years ago, colorful kites were seen flying in the sky
 shahar va gramin anchal ke makaanon kii chhaton or kisi oonche sthanon par patang udaate bacchon kii jhund dikhaai dete the, lekin pichley kuch saalon se yah najaara khatm hone ke kagaar par pahunch gaya he
 Only children of the count are seen flying kites
 aadhunik yug main computer va mobile par uplabdh kai tarah ke aakarshak games ne bacchon main patang udaane ke prati dilchaspee ko kam kar diya he
 This is the reason why young children nowadays are not showing interest in flying kites
 mobile va computer ke batano par haath chalaakar kai tarah ke games se anand uthaakar samay kaat rahe hai
 According to academician Pramod Sharma, children's continuous games on the computer are harmful for health, children should also play outdoor games from time to time
 rajdhani ke pramukh patang vyavsaayee abdul salaam rizvi ke mutabik, patang kaa vyavsaay bhi jab se video game or computer kaa chalan badha he tab se lagaataar girtaa ja rahaa he
 Now instead of flying kites in the holidays, the children spend more time on the computer
 baharhaal, bal man he ki use jo acha lagata he vah vahi karata he
 Now, even if it makes a difference to someone's business, what the children have to do with it, but parents must take care that sitting on the computer continuously playing games does not affect their children's health

 In Maharashtra, the BJP finally made a government with Ajit Pawar on Saturday morning under which plan
 sutron kaa kahana he ki iske peeche ek sochi-samajhi ganit he jise bijepi ke ranneetikaron ne anjaam diya he
 But now Sara Daromdar rests on the court what verdict he gives
 lekin sutron ke mutabik bijepi kaa jo plan tha vah yah ki bijepi ke paas 105 vidhayak hai, 13 nirdaleey hai
 Since Ajit Pawar was a legislative party leader, he claimed to support the BJP along with the party
 ajit pavaar ko 19 vidhayakon ke saath aane kii ummid thi
 If not with the remaining mlas, 35 of the 54 mlas would be expelled from the party and end the membership of the assembly
 iske baad vidhansabha main bahumat kaa aankada 127 ho jaataa he
 And then BJP would have the number of mlas 105 (BJP) + 13 (independents) +19 (NCP) = 137 means more than 10 than the 127 figure of majority
 is tarah bijepi kii sarkaar aasaani se ban jaati
 At present, the hearing of the Maharashtra case is to be held in the Supreme Court today
 congress-ncp or shivasena ne shanivaar kii subah hue apratyaashit shapathgrahan ke khilaaf supreme court main yachika di he
 But the BJP is also completely confident of the hearing in the Supreme Court and its tenor is based on a plea that Ajit Pawar is still the leader of the NCP Legislature Party and that if Ajit Pawar is allowed all to vote for the BJP The issuing whip of the NCP and if all the NCP mlas vote against it, the speaker can issue an order to end all membership
 aise 288 main se 53 vidhayak kam ho jaaenge or bahumat sabit karne kii sankhya 145 kii bajaay 118 ho jaaegi
 The BJP has already claimed around 118 with independents
 isliye bijepi ke netaa ashish shellar kaa kahana he ki ajit pavaar ko vidhanmandal dal kaa netaa chunaa janaa puri tarah se vaid he or jabaki unako hataakar jayant patil ko netaa bana dena puri tarah se gaiyr kanoonee he

 The festival of Dhan Teres, which falls two days before Deepawali, is not just a day of wishing Mahalakshmi for happiness, prosperity and wealth rain, but it is also a day to remember the goddess Vaidya Dhanvantari and Kubera, considered the treasurer of Lakshmi ji
 diwali se pehle krishna paksh kii trayodashi ko manaai jane vaali ‘dhan teras’ ko ‘dhanvantari trayodashi’ bhi kaha jaataa he or is din sone chaandi kii koi cheez yaa nae bartan kharidne ko atyant shubh mana jaataa he
 Acharya VK Shastri, who is associated with Indian philosophy, says that on the day of Dhan Teres, people usually understand itishri by purchasing gold or silverware or new utensils and worshiping Lakshmi ji, but forget the treasurer Kubera of Dev Vaidya Dhanvantari and Lakshmi ji Go
 unka maananaa he ki is din lakshmi ji ke saath in donon kii bhi puja kii jaani chahie kyonki kuber jahaan dhan kaa jod-ghataav rakhane vaale hai vahiin dhanvantari brahmad ke sabase bade vaidya hai
 According to Shastri, besides having a wealth of a person, having a healthy body is also most important
 yadi dhanwaan vyakti rogi hoga to uskaa sara dhan bimariyon par kharch ho jayega
 Therefore, to keep the body healthy, Dhanvantari should be wished on the day of Dhanteras
 acharya govind vatsa kaa kahana he ki dhanteras par kuber ke bina lakshmi ji kii puja adhuri rahati he
 Kuber only keeps the book of all accounts
 unhone kaha ki dhan sampada ke liye kuber ke mahatv ke chalate hi bhartiya rigerv bank main lakshmi ji ke saath kuber kii pratimaa lagaai gai he
 On the day of Dhanteras not only new items are purchased but lamps are also burnt
 iske peeche kai tarah kii kinvadantiyaan or janashrutiyaan hai
 On this day, there is a belief about the lamps that are lit at the entrance, because of this they end the fear of premature death in the house and the flame of the family is always burning
 vatsa kaa kahana he ki dhan teras ke din aryuvedic aushadhiyon ke janak dhanvantari ko nahin bhoolanaa chahie 
 In the Veda Puranas, Dhanvantari is described as the first surgeon of the universe

 assam main jari hue neshnal register of citigens (enarasi) list par ek ore raajnneeti tej hoti ja rahi he, to duusari ore ve log behad tanaav or sankat main aa gaye hai jinke parivaar ke kuch sadasyon ke naam is list main he, lekin kuch ke naam abhi bhi nadaarad hai
 What will happen to them if their names are rejected even after the application
 enarasi kii jari duusari listmen 2 karod 89 lakh 83 hajaar 677 logon ko vaid naagarik maan liya gaya he
 While 3,29,91,384 people applied for it, out of which 40,07,707 people were considered illegal
 is tarah se 40 lakh se zyada logon ko beghar hona padegaa
 However, politics has also started regarding this
 pashchim bengal kimukhyamantri mamata banerjeeur unki party trinmul congress enarasi main jari list kaa lagaataar virodh kar rahi he
 Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said that despite many people having Aadhaar cards and passports, their names are not in the draft
 sahi dastavejon ke baavjood logon ko draft main shaamil nahin kiya gaya
 He is excluded because of his surname
 kya bijepi sarkaar jabardastee logon ko baahar nikaalnaa chaahati he?sarkaar kaa kahana he ki jari list antim nahin he or jin logon ke naam isamen shaamil nahin hai wo iske liye puraane aavedan patr kii raseed ke saath apni shikaayat darj kara sakate hai
 In this regard, Mamta Banerjee is scheduled to meet Home Minister Rajnath Singh this evening
 enarasiki list aane ke baad badi sankhya main log chintit hai or unka bhavishya bhi anishchit ho gaya he
 In 10 things, we know what will happen next
 -enarasi ke jariye assam main rah rahe sabhi bhartiya nagarikon ke naam, pate or photo darj kar liye gaye hai
 In this way, this is the first time that information about people living illegally throughout the state will be available
 -assam pehla aisa rajya ban gaya he jahaan enarasi apadet kiya ja rahaa he
 The Supreme Court in 2015 ordered that it be updated within the stipulated time
 -naagarikta kanuunse itar thode alag rup main rajya main assam acord, 1985 lagu he jo yah kahata he ki 24 march, 1971 kii aadhi raat se pehle tak rajya main aane vaale logon ko bhartiya naagarik mana jayega
 - 40 lakh people who are not named in the second list, they still have a chance to complain
 enarasi koordinator ne kaha ki philhal is list ke aadhaar par kisi bhi naagarik ko philhal ditension centre main nahin bheja jayega
 This complaint can be made between 30 July to 28 September
 -shikaayat karne ke liye helpline number (15107) diya gaya he jis par kisi bhi samay kol kii ja sakati he
 Apart from this, applicants living outside Assam can give their information by calling (18003453762)
 is dauraan aavedak ko raseed sankhya kii jaankaree deni hogi
 - If the complaint against the list is also rejected, then people will have the option to appeal to the foreign authority
 haalanki yah maamla kitne din main nipatega iske bare main supreme court ko faisla lenaa hoga
 At the same time, Home Minister Rajnath Singh says that complete transparency will be taken in this regard
 isamen centre kii koi bhoomika nahin he
 All this is happening under the supervision of the Supreme Court
 -enarasi list se baahar hue 40 lakh logon ke matdaan adhikaar kaa kya hoga, is par chunaav ayog ko faisla lenaa hoga
 - Those excluded from the list will still continue to get discounts and facilities under government schemes
 yah sthiti philhal pehle jaisi hi rahegi
 - Including the name must prove through his complaint that he was born in Assam before March 21, 1971
 list main unheen logon ko shaamil kiya gaya he jinke purvaj 1951 main hui pehali janaganana main shaamil rahe hon, yaa phir jinka naam 24 march, 1971 ko assam kii nirvaachak namavali main shaamil rahaa ho
 -NRC system has not been introduced for the first time
 enarasi ke jariye kisi bhi rajya main vaid tareeke se rah rahe nagarikon kaa record rakhaa jaataa he
 The NRC was first formulated in 1951 and the data included in this register contained details of everyone's name, age, father's or husband's name, home and information on essential items
 in registeron ko pehle dipti kamishnar sab-diviginal officer ke daftaron main rakhaa jaataa tha, baad main ise police vibhaag ke paas bhej diya gaya
 How long the final NRC will continue in the balance and how long the whole case will run, nothing can be said in this regard, the Supreme Court will have to take a decision on this
 sawaal yah he ki in 40 lakh logon main jin logon kii naagarikta chali jaaegi unka kya hoga
 What will the government do with them? kya sarkaar unhen desh se baahar jane ko kahegi
 If India pressurizes Bangladesh that it will not be easy to invite them here, Bangladesh will not accept them under any circumstances
 is mudde par donon deshon main tanatani banati he to asar rishton par bhi padegaa, jo vartmaan main centre sarkaar nahin chaahegi
 At the moment, it is not easy to say anything about the future
