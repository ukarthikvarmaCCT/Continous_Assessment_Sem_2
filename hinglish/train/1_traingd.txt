 It is also being said that the party has now agreed to make Lingayat leader Jagdish Shettar as CM on behalf of Yeddyurappa
 mana ja rahaa he ki party aane vaale raashtrapati chunaav main kisi bhi prakaar se sharmindagi uthaane ke mood main nahin he
 The party fears that Yeddyurappa's support may not go beyond the party's candidate and vote
 iske alaava ab party ko yah bhi dar sataane laga he ki kahin gauda ke samarthak ab cross voting kaa hissaa na ban jaaen
 Also, CM Sadanand Gowda is coming to Delhi today to talk to the party high command to resolve the matter

 Now these ministers have withdrawn their resignation after the party high command spoke to Yeddyurappa

 Apart from this, the party has given some assurance to Yeddyurappa
 vahiin baagi gut netritv parivartan se kam main raji hone ko taiyaar nahin tha
 Party sources say that before July 5, the party will reach a major result
 tippaniyan Meanwhile, the Yeddyurappa faction has given only four days to remove Chief Minister DV Sadananda Gowda
 yah taarikh paanch july ko samaapt ho rahi he

 unke yahaan andazan 43 vidhayak, 11 vidhaan parishad ke sadsy or 8 saansad maujuud the
 But Yeddyurappa himself and his nearest Shobha Karandlaje were not present
 yani ye log agar chahen to sadanand gauda kii sarkaar gir sakati he
 It is believed that the party is not in any mood to take any kind of shyness in the upcoming presidential election
 party ko dar he ki yediurppa ke samarthan kahin party ke samarthit pratyaashee se itar jaakar matdaan na kar den
 Apart from this, now the party has also started to fear that Gowda's supporters may no longer be a part of cross voting

 What breaks my heart is they can't even access proper schools as refugee kids
 
 
 how will they access higher education?? These hopes and dreams
 
 where do they stand in the reality of their world? The government schools in Jordan have added evening classes and 200 schools to accommodate the growing number of Syrian children which is approximately 12 xxrep 4 0 children
 
 But it's never enough

 Sulaiman needs a 2nd surgery because he has a clot in his nose
 The family moved from Syria to Jordan 5 years ago
 When i asked their mother what would be her wish
 
 
 considering the war has not ended, she said "if we can't go home all i want is for my kids to get an education so they can fend for themselves when they are older and help rebuild Syria
 We are blessed, we have enough to survive

 As we go about our daily privileged lives, it's hard to imagine that everything can be taken from you in an moment
 Today we spent the day in a host community meeting Syrian refugee families (like this one) so desperately seeking a safe place of normalcy for their families
 More than 80% of the Syrian refugees in Jordan live outside refugee camps in cities, urban centers and farming villages (host communities
 ) Amman hosts the largest number of Syrian refugees, about 180,000 people
 Refugee families in host communities have limited livelihood opportunities, and after 6 years, have depleted their savings and borrowed money from everywhere to feed and support their families

 a parade of mlas held at the Hyatt Hotel in Mumbai in the name of Sharad, Sonia and Uddhav, Shiv Sena, Congress, NCP MLA, political violence continues in Lee Shapathmaharashtra
 devendra fadanvis ne ensipi netaa ajit pavaar ke saath milakar sarkaar to bana lee lekin vidhansabha main bahumat sabit karnaa unke liye badi chunauti hogi
 On Monday, Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP paraded 162 of their mlas at the Hyatt Hotel in Mumbai
 saath hi bijepi ko yah sandesh bhi diya ki unke paas vidhansabha main bahumat sabit karne ke liye paryaapt sankhya bal he
 Now the question arises that if Sharad Pawar has the support of NCP mlas then how did Ajit Pawar get the support of the party mlas
 iskaa khulaasa ensipi ke hi do vidhayakon ne kiya
 In a special conversation with India Today, NCP mlas Anil Patil and Daulat Daroda told what happened between their return from Delhi to Mumbai last Friday night (november 22) to Monday morning (november 25)
 in vidhayakon ko ajit pavaar ne dilli bhej diya tha
 Pawar got power - Uddhav got energy, 162 mlas in front, both such leaders Anil Patil said, 'ajit Dada called us at night and said that all the mlas will meet at 7 am on Saturday
 vah hamaare party netaa hai, lihaaja unke aadesh ko maananaa hamaara kartavya he
 We reached his bungalow, from where we were boarded
 unhone aage kaha, '15 minute baad ham rajbhavan pahunche
 Before that we did not know where we were going
 iske baad vahaan raashtragan hua or phir shapath grahan samaaroh
 This was followed by the national anthem
 'unhone kaha, 'shapath grahan samaaroh ke baad ajit pavaar ne kaha ki hamen aisi sarkaar banani he, jo 5 saal chale
 It will be difficult to form a government of 3 parties and it is also feared how long it will last
 isliye hamen do partiyon ke saath sarkaar banani chahie
 "aditya Thackeray took oath in the name of Sonia Gandhi, not Bala Saheb's Shiv Sena" Patil said, "we were ready for this because we felt it was happening with the blessings of NCP supremo Sharad Pawar
" phir hamen jane ko kaha or bataaya gaya ki anya ensipi vidhayak bhi yahi karenge
 Patil said that NCP mlas mostly do not directly talk to Sharad Pawar
 unhen ajit pavaar se hi cordinate karnaa hota he
 So we felt that this is the decision of the party
 unhone bataaya ki ajit pavaar ne yahi kaha tha ki party kaa bhi yahi faisla he
 Patil further said, 'we were accused of being rebels
 hamen hamaare netaa ajit pavaar ne bulaayaa tha
 So we went to meet
 aise main ham baagi kaise ho gaye
 But when we understood the situation, we returned
 hamane ajit pavaar se bhi kaha ki hamaare liye sharad pavaar kaa faisla myne rakhata he
 'anil Patil continued,' When we reached Delhi, we did not know anyone
 kuch bijepi vidhayak hamase airport par mili
 There were enough people, so we immediately boarded the car and reached a hotel in Gurugram
 vahaan sade kapadon main police afasar the
 Initially we thought they were visitors
 lekin agle hi din pataa chal gaya ki ve surakshakarmi hai
 'NCP leader's warning- Sharad Pawar will be emptied at the behest of BJP NCP MLA further said that after understanding the situation, he called the party leaders and Sharad Pawar assured that he would be recalled
 unhone kaha, 'hamane party kaaryakartaaon ke pahunchane kaa intjaar kiya
 Local NCP leaders advised us how to reach the lift and how to get out of the hotel
 3-4 minute baad ham baahar aa gaye
 "there, the other MLA, Daroda said," We are not with any party
 hamane vahiin se sharad pavaar or supriya sule se baat kii or unhone hamen bharosa dilaayaa
 We have won the election on the symbol of NCP
 sharad pavaar hamaare bos hai or netaa bhi
 The whip Sharad Pawar has issued will be followed and his order is enough for us

 bollywood ke superstar shahrukh khan kii film 'fain' is hafte relies hone ja rahi he
 Here is the highlight of the special conversation with Shahrukh: What is the definition of Fan? For me, Fan means 'to love someone without any fear'
 vaise dur se pyaar karne vaale bahut zyada pyaar karte hai
 Love happens at home with many conditions
 film main apane luk ke bare main bataaie, aap do kirdaar nibhaa rahe hai?jab hamane film shuru kii to hamaare man main pehle se hi tha ki ye donondbal roleke jaise nahin lagane chahie
 i played both superstar Aryan Khanna and Gaurav in this film
 vah bhi aryan yani meri tarah dikhataa he or apane aap ko aryan khan samajhataa he
 Director Manish wanted to be a fan who looks a bit like me
 jab aap apane hi jaise dikhne vaale kisi shaks ko dekhte hai to kaisaa lagata he?mujhe yahi lagata he ki main usase zyada handsam lagata hum
 How difficult was it for Gaurav's character to look younger? The makeup that was done this time is called 'D Makeup'
 jinhone 'kapur and sans' main rishi kapur kaa mechap kiya tha, vahi is film main bhi hamaari madad kar rahe hai
 i feel young anyway so i did not find it difficult to play this character
 mujhe yaad he jab 'veerajara'main maine ek bujurg kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa tha
 It was difficult at that time
 mujhe to rani mukherjee ko beti kahana hi kaaphi mushkil laga
 Have you met such a stubborn fan? No, i don't meet most people, but there are many fans who love me very much
 america main koi fain hai jisane chand par mere liye jameen kharid kar mujhe gift kiya he
 There is another fan who also makes my photos
 fain kii limit hoti he?fain ko aap ye nahin kah sakate ki use kya karnaa he
 i can definitely say that do not hurt yourself, i will never be happy with that
 meri life privet nahin rahi or meri family bhi ye jaanati he ki main ab sirf unka nahin hum
 They understand my work
 airport par bhi wo mujhase kehete hai 'papa ham pehle nikal jate hai, aap aaraam se aaie, kyonki photo bhi khichegi aapako vakt lagegaa
 'children understand a lot
 mere paas koi privet life nahin he, lekin main bas yahi chahta hum ki meri ek beti bhi he jise log bhaddi gaaliyaan naa den
 It looks very bad
 isiilie maine bacchon ko videsh main padhane ke liye bheja jisase kii wo is tarah kii life se dur rahen
 Which actor other than you could have played this role? Whoever played this role had to act like a double role because the character of 'gaurav' had to look like a superstar
 superstar ke role ke liye koi bhi maja hua actor jaisshmitabh bachchan, salmaan khan,aamir khan, or akshay bhi ye kirdaar nibhaa sakate the kyonki use parde par 'superstar' dikhnaa hi hoga
 Do you think that your son Aryan could also play the role of 'gaurav' in this film? i think Aryan does not know that much acting
 gaurav ke role ke liye anubhav kii jarurat thi
 It is very difficult to double roll
 maine 'dupliket' main kiya tha to mujhe anubhav tha
 Was there a film that was sad to be unable to do? i wanted to do Subhash Kapoor's film 'jolly LLB' but could not do it due to the commitments with other films
 film bahut hi acchhee thi
 Aditya waited for me for a year and a half for 'chak De'
 ab aap saal main zyada filmein karenge?haa, ab mere paas kaaphi time he
 i am hungry for work and i will definitely do at least 3 films a year
 international level par kaam karnaa chahenge?main bas yahi kahuunga ki 'fain' usee level kii film he
 No one has ever given me a film at the international level
 vaise bade garv kii baat he ki irfan, priyanka, deepika, om puri, anil kapur us jagah bhi acha kaam kar rahe hai
 All these actors are very good
 mujhe ofer nahin mila or main chance bhi nahin lenaa chahta
 i will make a film in India that everyone will like at the international level
 celebs banane ke baad stress level bhi badhata he?ji jab aap aisi industry main hote hai to ek baat nahin bhulani chahie ki aap wo insaan nahin hai, jo parde par dikhaai dete hai
 Star should be familiar with your reality
 kabir khan or salmaan khan kii jodi jab bhi box offis par ai, chaa gai
 Whether it was a tiger or a Bajrangi Bhaijaan
 vaise tubalite ke saath bhi kabir ne is dadli combination ko cash karaane kii koshish kii he
 However, Kabir Khan has cooled down on Salman for some time and an attempt has been made to make him a common man

 The real-life brothers Salman Khan and Sohail Khan are also brothers in the film

 The whole story revolves around that
 'tiger jinda he' main ye hoga salmaan-katrina kaa luk!second half he had se zyada imoshnalapahala half mjedaar he to duusare half main imoshans kii aandhi aa jaati he
 Sohail and Salman's bromance is good
 salmaan phir se sandesh de rahe hai
 The music is good but a lot
 storiline bikhri hui he
 The film is drawn
 'tubalite' kuch had tak bajrangi bhaijan kaa hi ekstansion lagati he
 What is out of Salman Khan in Tubelight, in 7 Points, there is a romantic film Tubelightalgaatar This is the second Eid when Salman Khan will be seen trying to wet the eyes of his fans
 aise main salmaan ke hardkor phans ko ruk-ruk kar jalane vaali yah 'tubalite' tang kar sakati he kyonki unke phans ko to larger dain life salmaan pasand hai
 Then the salman-katrina duo will appear in the sequel of Tiger Zinda Hai
 lekin salmaan kii alag-alag tarah ke role karne kii koshish kaabiletarif he
 Chinese actress Zhu Zhu and Arinachal Pradesh's Matin Ray are to show the Chinese connection in the film
 jhu jhu aakarshak lagi hai to matin phuli antertaning hai
 Although Salman Khan says that his films are review-proof, he probably doesn't care what the critics say but we will keep an eye on how far Salman goes in terms of earnings

 com / vxdarghrkj The Jawaharlal Nehru Teachers Association (JNUTA) termed the university administration's decision to seek biodata from historian Romila Thapar to continue as Professor Emeritus post 'politically motivated'
 jeenutie ke bayaan ke baad vishvavidhyalay ne kaha ki vah jeenyu main professor ameritas ke pad par niyukti ke liye apane adhyadesh kaa paalan kar rahaa he

 yah patr sirf un professor ameritas ko likhe gaye hai jo is shrenee main aate hai
 The university clarified that it has written this letter not to end their service but to inform the review by the executive council of the university's highest statutory body, and the same happens in other prestigious universities like MIT and University of Princeton
 thapar ne sampark karne par pushti kii ki unhen july main patr mila tha or unhone iskaa jawaab diya he ‚Äò yah jivan bhar kaa sammaan he

 In July, the university registrar wrote a letter to Thapar asking him to provide biodata to evaluate whether Thapar should continue as professor emeritus

 Bharti Airtel has recently changed its market strategy significantly
 jeeyo kii entry ke baad se airtel ne apane data tarriff main bhi badlaav kiya he
 If you look at Airtel's prepaid portfolio, here you have many smart recharge plans, talk time plans, ISD packs and many combo plans
 ham yahaan aapako kuch data plance kii jaankaree yahaan de rahe hai
 28-rupee plan: In this 28-rupee plan, customers are given 500MB of data
 company ne is plan kii validity 28 dinon kii rakhi he
 In such a situation, you can assume that this plan is for feature phone users or customers who use very little data in a month
 ise kisi duusare preeped plan ke saath data booster ke taur par bhi yuj kiya ja saktaa he
 48-rupee plan: This prepaid data pack of 48 rupees is only slightly more expensive than the 28-rupee plan
 lekin isamen 3GB data miltaa he
 The validity of this plan is also 28 days only
 aise main ye plan un graahakon ke liye behatar he jo thodaa zyada data chaahate hai
 However, the price will also have to be paid a little more 92 rupee vaala plan:ye plan thodaa alag he, isamen 7 dinon kii validity ke dauraan 6GB data diya jaataa he
 This plan is better for those people who use more than 600MB of data in a day
 yani ise video dekhne or soshal media ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Plan of Rs 98: Finally, talking about the most expensive plan i
e
 Rs 98 plan of Airtel's data prepaid portfolio, customers are given 6GB data in it
 haalanki isaki validity bhi 28 dinon kii hi he
 This is better for those customers who sometimes need additional data with their existing plans

 We decided that we would have to curb the runs and we would take advantage of it when the wickets start falling

 ab vah sarvaadhik shatak lagane vaale ballebaajon kii suchi main sachin tendulkar ke baad duusare number par kabiz ho gayi hai
 Kallis scored the 39th of his career in the first innings of the third and final Test match against India and then the 40th in the second innings
 yah unka newlands par aathvaan or bharat ke khilaaf chatha shatak he
 Playing his 145th Test match, Kallis scored a century in both innings of the match for the second time in his career
 isse pehle unhone pakistan ke khilaaf 2007 main karachi test main 155 or naabad 100 ran kii paariyaan kheli thi
 Kallis has not been able to score a century against Sri Lanka only of the Test playing nations
 unhone westeindies ke khilaaf sarvaadhik aath or england ke khilaaf saat shatak jade hai
 Kallis has scored six against India and Pakistan, five against New Zealand, four against Australia, three against Zimbabwe and one against Bangladesh
 test cricket main sarvaadhik shatak lagane vaale das ballebaaj is prakaar hai:sachin tendulkar(51), jaak kallis (40), riki ponting(39), sunil gavaskar or bryan lara(donon 34), steve vaa(32), rahul dravid(31), mathew heden(30), don breadman(29) or mahela jayavardhane(28) Maharashtra Congress President Ashok Chavan has also proposed resignation after Rahul Gandhi offered his resignation
 chavaan kaa maananaa he ki congress kii haar ke liye akele rahul gandhi ko jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa or iske liye har pradesh ke adhyaksh javabdeh hai
 Chavan said that Prakash Ambedkar's party is more to blame for the Congress's poor performance in Maharashtra
 rahul gandhi ke rashtriya adhyaksh pad se istife kii peshkash kiye jane ke baad alag-alag pradeshon ke kai netaa apane apane istife de rahe hai
 These include Maharashtra unit president Ashok Chavan
 media se baat karte hue chavaan ne kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav main congress ke kharaab pradarshan ke liye rahul gandhi akele jimmedaar nahin hai balki sabhi pradeshik adhyaksh bhi baraabar ke jimmedaar hai
 Chavan has submitted his resignation and says that the final decision on this is to be taken by Rahul Gandhi
 pichley do loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle maharashtra khaskar mumbai congress kaa garh rahi he
 Now in both Maharashtra and Mumbai, the condition of the Congress is pathetic
 kharaab haalat kaa silsilaa us vakt shuru hua jab chunaav se thik pehle vipaksh ke netaa radhakrishna patil ke bete sujay vikhe patil ne congress chhodkar bijepi kaa daaman tham liya
 An even bigger shock was that Sujay Vikhe Patil won the Ahmednagar seat on a BJP ticket
 congress ke jhatkon kaa silsilaa yahi nahin rukaa
 Ashok Chavan, who won in the 2014 elections despite a strong Modi wave, also lost by a record 40 thousand votes this time
 chavaan kii haar congress ke liye bahut badi kshati he kyonki party ne kabhi sapane main nahin sochaa tha ki aisa bhi ho saktaa he
 After the defeat of Ashok Chavan, the Congress has blamed it on Prakash Ambedkar's party deprived Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) party
 yahaan tak ki chavaan bhi kah chuke hai ki prakaash ambedkar kii party bijepi kii bi party he
 The Congress believes that VBA has lost 9-10 seats in Maharashtra
 ashok chavaan ne kaha, 'is haar ke liye rahul gandhi akele jimmedaar nahin hai
 We have lost in many states
 iske liye sabhi pradesh adhyaksh jimmedaar hai, isliye unhen bhi istipha dena chahie
 i am responsible for the defeat in Maharashtra
 humlog chaahate hai ki rahul gandhi kade kadam uthaaen, party main jaruri badlaav karen or congress ko netritv den
 We have lost many seats due to Prakash Ambedkar's party
 darasal ve log bijepi ke liye kaam kar rahe the
 Assembly elections are held in several states after a few months
 mujhe bharosa he ki vidhansabha chunaavon main sthiti kuch or hogi
 This is teamwork, so Rahul Gandhi cannot be held responsible alone
 ' In Madhi village of up's Bijnor, the panchayat publicly humiliated a woman
 mahila par gaanv main premi yugalon ko badhaava dene kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he
 The woman kept cleaning in front of the panchayat, but the panches did not listen to her
 darasal, gaanv main rahane vaali ek mahila bala devi par panchayat ne prem prasangon ko badhaava dene kaa aarope lagaaya

 By the time police reached the village, all the accused were absconding
 sirf ek aaropee ko police pakadaney main kaamyaab ho pai he
 In fact, a woman living in the village, Bala Devi, was accused by the panchayat of promoting love affairs
 panchayat ne saream mahila kaa munhakaala kar chiraharan karne kaa talibani farmaan suna diya
 When Bala's son tried to stop the misbehaving Panchas on the orders of the Panchayat, the Panchas also beat him down

 UP assembly election is in its last stop
 antim do charnon ke liye purvanchal main matdaan hona he
 In such a situation, all the main parties have given full strength to win the last battle
 sabase zyada chunauti bijepi ke liye he
 The BJP has been very weak in the seats in Purvanchal
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah samet tamaam kendriya mantri or puraa pradesh nesatv purvanchal main data hua he
 The most special emphasis is on Varanasi
 purvanchal main varanasi bijepi ke liye sirf jeet kaa token hi nahin balki saakh kaa sawaal bhi he
 The first reason is that PM Modi himself is an MP from here
 doosraa kii haalat varanasi main aisi nahin ki vah clin sweep kar sake
 The third problem is the rebel party workers
 jinamein se kuch bijepi ke khilaaf hi taal thok rahe hai
 Varanasi has eight assembly seats
 inamen se varanasi shahar kii teenon siton par bijepi kaa kabja he
 Now ticket distribution has become a big problem of BJP after which many leaders have come out on an open revolt

 Sujit Singh was seeking tickets from Varanasi North seat but did not give them

 The World Cup semi-final between Australia and India will be the last World Cup match for either team's captains
 isliye is jang main saalon kaa anubhav jhonkne kii taiyaari main maaikel clark or mahendra singh dhoni donon hi honge
 There is no doubt that Michael Clarke is a tremendous captain but if we talk about winning in big matches, then hardly any of the captains of all the existing teams around the world will also stand around Dhoni
 dhoni jahaan pichhlaa worldcup jitkar is worldcup main captaini karne utre hai vahiin clark ke liye captain ke taur par ye pehla world cap he
 In the experience, not even half of Dhoni is talking about captaincy in Clarkevan-day matches, so Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Michael Clarke have no match
 dhoni ne ab tak 177 maichon main bharat kii captaini kii he or 100 maichon main wo bharat ko jeet bhi dilaa chuke hai, 62 maichon main bharat kii haar hui he, 4 match taai rahe jabaki 11 kaa koi nateeja nahin niklaa
 On the other hand, Michael Clarke's experience in captaincy is only 72 one-day matches, of which Australia has won 48 matches and lost 21, 3 matches did not yield any result
 australia ke khilaaf bhi dhoni 34 maichon main captaini kar chuke hai jabaki clark ne bharat ke khilaaf sirf 3 hi maichon main captaini kii he
 Dhoni is captain of the big matches, be it the World T20 final in 2007, the 2011 World Cup final or the 2013 Champions Trophy final, Mahendra Singh Dhoni has won his captaincy every time
 yahi nahin ipel ke final maichon main bhi dhoni kii captaini kii hameshaa tarif hui 
 He also made his team Chennai Super Kings twice IPL champions under his captaincy
 dhoni ke records saaf bataate hai ki jitna bada match hota he dhoni kii captaini utani hi nikhar kar aati he
 On the other hand, Australia has not won a major tournament under the captaincy of Michael Clarke
 dabaav main damdaar captaini dikhaane main clark ab tak naakaam hi rahe hai
 Dhoni's morale is high because of the victory in the last World Cup and the explosive performance in every match of this World Cup, Dhoni's morale is high as a captain, Dhoni's morale as a batsman after playing match-winning innings against Zimbabwe But the sky is also touching
 vahiin clark pichley kaaphi samay se fitness se jujh rahe hai
 At the start of the World Cup, he also had to sit on the bench for this reason
 newzealand ke khilaaf ek kareebi mukaable main unki team kii haar bhi hui, jiskaa asar clark ke manobal par bhi hua

 But the new note appeared in Delhi in a bit
 nai dilli ke pradhan daakghar yani gol dak khaanaa par jab subah saat baje hamaari team pahunchi, to note badalawaane or apane khate se nae noton kii shakl main paise nikalwane ke liye pehle si hi log maujuud the
 Some were compelled and some arrived here in search of new notes
 jaankaree yaheen thi ki subah aath baje se hi daakghar mennote badalane kaa kaamshuru ho jayega or logon ko fatafat kharch ke laayak paise mil jaaenge
 But this did not happen and people had to face a lot of trouble
 daakkhaane par samay se pehle pahunche loggol dak khaanaa par subah subah pahunche logon ko sabase pehle to ek notice dekhne ko mila jisamen ye jaankaree to thi, ki kis counter par kya hoga, lekin kitne baje se prakriya shuru hogi, iskaa koi zikr nahin tha
 Secondly, it was found that just showing the ID card will not work, but it has to be given a photocopy, people left the bus line and ran for photocopying
 lekin tabhi ye jaankaree ai ki daakghar to das baje se apana kaam shuru karegaa, ab majaboor log kya karte, to intjaar ke alaava koi chaara bhi nahin tha
 The test of people's patience did not end here, because at ten o'clock, there was news from inside the post office that it would take time to get cash from the bank
 teen ghante se line main lage anand ne kaha ki wo badi ummid se aaye the ki bhale hi line main laganaa hoga, lekin kaam aasaani se ho jayega, lekin line main lage lage ghanton guzar gaye,note kaa didaar nahin hua
 The same was the case with Satish, who hurried out of the house to go to the office so that he would stop at the post office on the way and exchange the notes, but even after waiting for three hours, the money transaction could not start at the head post office till 11 am
 daakghar ke karmchaaree bhi hairaan pareshaan dikhe
 On talking, it was found that he had instructions to open the post office at his normal time, he did not know from where the time came at eight o'clock in the morning
 is par bhi bank se cash main aane deree ho gai, to logon kaa intazaar or batch gaya

 Mokshada Ekadashi comes on Margashirsha Shukla Ekadashi
 is din ko moksh prapti kaa din kaha jaataa he
 On this day Lord Krishna gave knowledge of Gita to Arjuna
 aaj ke din puja upasna se vyakti ko moksh kii prapti sambhav hoti he
 On this day, the fruit of charity is attained in infinite fold
 mokshada ekadshi par karen ye upaay- praatavkaal snaan karke surya devtaa ko jal arpit karen- iske baad pile vastra dhaaran karke bhagwaan krishna kii puja karen
 - Offer yellow flowers, panchamrit and tulsi dal to them - After this chant the mantras of Lord Krishna - or recite Bhagavad Gita - Donate clothes or food to a poor person - Well, it is better to keep waterless fast - but need What is the significance of Geeta Jayanti when water intake and fruits can be taken? - Lord Krishna on Margashirsha Shukla Ekadashi in the Kurukshetra field It was preached that - This day is celebrated in the name of Geeta Jayanti
 - gita maatr ek pustak nahin he balki yah upadeshon kaa jeevant swarup he atah isaki jayanti manaai jaati he
 - Its teachings are as relevant today as they were in the past, so its birth anniversary is also celebrated due to being alive in every era

 vaise shaharon main badi sankhya main aise log hai jinhone jati kaa anubhav us tarah se nahin kiya, lekin inaki sankhya naganya he
 Denying the truth of caste and related events is like closing a window if there is a drain on the back of the house
 jabaki bajabajaata hua naala badastoor bahata rahata he
 The most compassionate and indignant expressions of this buzzing are found in the autobiographies which have been recorded by the marginalized people in the caste system while facing its horrors
 ise ham dalit sahitya ke naam se jaanate hai
 At the Bharat Rang Mahotsav, the actors of the Raga Sanstha of Patna presented such a story of Indian social life on stage with their energetic and sensitive acting which may seem incredible but the real people of it are among us
 in abhinaytaon ne daliton ke jivan, utpeedan ke saath-saath unke saahas or aakankshaon ko bhi darshakon ke saamne rakhaa
 The years-long silence on the stage has also turned into a scream many times but we have to accept that some truths have to be said aloud
 daliton kii pidaa or shoshan kaa aakhyaan ekahara nahin he isaki kai parate hai
 There are also categories within Dalits
 kai to aisi hai ki is jati vyavastha se hi baahar hai
 They have different dimensions of exploitation
 randhir nirdeshit rang prastuti ‚Äòoutcast‚Äô utpeedan ke saamaajik satya kii kai paraton ko sharan kumaar limbale kii charchit aatmakatha ‚Äòakkarmashi‚Äô ke jariye ughadkar darshakon ke saamne pesh karata he
 'akkarmashi' describes in detail several episodes of Limbale's life where he faces the caste system
 ve baar-baar poochhate hai ki is vyavastha main unki jagah kahaan he? ve koun hai? Akkarmashi is the true story of the struggle of a Jaraj child
 akkarmashi yani use apane pita ke bare thik-thik nahin pataa
 Now since there is no father, there is no surname and no caste
 isse jujhate hue sabase dayaneey sthiti limbale kii maa kii he, jise balak limbale apni ankhon se dekhtaa bhi he or poochta he ‚Äòkisi ne apni maa ko bhi sambhog karte hue dekha he kya?' yahaan pahchaan kii samasya kai staron par he
 Akkarmashi is also lower in social hierarchy than Dalit caste like Mahar
 inhen na pani pine kaa haq he na prem karne kaa
 Even after getting a job from education and reservation through tough struggle, they do not get the rights of ordinary citizens
 naukari karte hue bhi limbale ko shmashaan main rahane padataa he
 They say that the real fight is to get a respectable place in the society
 aazaadee ke baad bhartiya samvidhan se inhen aarakshan or kuch anya adhikaar mili lekin sammanjanak jagah aaj tak nahin mili
 And today, agitation has started in Maharashtra itself to protest against reservation and the law protecting Dalits
 prastuti aarakshan ke sandarbh main majbootee se apana paksh rakhti he
 In the presentation, the actor says' finish the reservation but first show a life like ours
 ' The narrative is given several levels to present the story on stage
 ek par kathanak chalata he jise baari-baari se sabhi paatr kehete hai
 The story of his harassment from his activities while telling the story also happens on the stage
 sangeet se or abhinaytao kii gatiyon se katha kii samvednaa ko or gadha kiya gaya he
 Along with Marathi, Bhojpuri folk songs have been put to good use
 video ke sahare prastuti ko aitihaasik or samayik pariprekshya diya gaya he
 These scenes have a Brahminical interpretation of the origin of Dalits
 jeenyu kii chaatra kaa bayaan he, jise is santhaan main bhi jatigat pahchaan ko jhelana padaa he or baba sahab ambedkar kaa bhaashan he
 Some more contemporary events could be added through video scenes
 lekhak dalit or prastuti ke nirdeshak savarna hai, to yah bhi jigyaasa thi ki kya jatigat pahchaan kaa koi bhi ansh aisa aata he jisamen savarna pahchaan mukhar he? lekin nirdeshkon ne puri tarah apni patibaddhta dalit sangharsh or kathy ke saath banaae rakhi he
 Limbale present during the presentation also appreciates this
 aaj jab dalit hi dalit kii baat karenge vaala mudda jere bahes he to is prastuti ko dekhnaa chahie ki mukti kaa ek saajha lakshya bhi he jise varna or varg ke vibhed ko todakar hi paaya ja saktaa he
 It is definitely that they have to sacrifice the most in this due to which this system is there
 desh, duniya, mahanagar, khel, aarthik or bollywood main kya kuch hua

 He said that RSS is the parent body of BJP, they also demand ordinance on Ram temple
 vishwa hindu parishad jo bijepi ke sabase bade prachaarak hai, jo jagah- jagah par dharm sansad dharmasabha karte hai wo bhi adhyadesh kii maang karte hai
 Leave the Shiv Sena, first the RSS will have to ask the BJP whether you are building a Ram temple or not
 raut ne kaha kiraam mandirke liye hue andolan main hinduon kaa itnaa bada narsanhaar hua tha, kya aap desh se maafee maangenge? mandir ke naam par is desh main itnaa bada sanhaar hua he, bam blast hue hai

 darasal, unhone ek chif of dephence staff (sidies) kii niyukti kii ghoshnaa kii jo sarkaar kaa single point sainya salaahkaar hoga
 The announcement, approved by the Cabinet Committee on Defense, set the stage for India's biggest military reform since independence
the government has decided to corporateize 41 Ordnance Factories of the Ministry of Defense (mod) which will be equipped with clothing for the Indian Army
 Everything from armored vehicles, rifles to artillery needs
 nirnay kii aupchaarik ghoshnaa honi baaki he, lekin prakriya shuru ho chuki he
 The factories function as attached offices of the Department of Defense Production, which is a part of the Ministry of Defense
 samuhik rup se ve duniya ke sabase bade raksha vibhaag kaa ang hai or kolkata sthiti aayudh factory board (oefbi) ke tatwadhan main kaam karte hai
 The OFB receives more than 80 percent of its orders from the military
 ise 2,000 karod rupye se adhik kaa vaarshik raksha bajet miltaa he, isamen 82,000 karmchaaree kaam karte hai or iske paas 60,000 acre se adhik bhoomi he
 Nevertheless, it barely meets even 50 percent of the Army's requirements
 oefbi ke ekadhikaar ko samaapt karne ke liye pehla kadam pichley saal uthaaya gaya tha, jab sarkaar ne 275 gaiyr-pramukh vastuon ko adhishuchet kiya jise sashastr bal khule bazaar se kharid sakate thekya yah paryaapt he?sidies to sirf pehla kadam he
 India is among the five countries with the highest defense spending in the world, yet it has been unable to make it a military superpower
 hamen sashastr balon kii teen sevaaon ke prayaason ke bich talmail baithaana hogngla kadam 17 ekal-seva kaman ko do yaa adhik sevaaon ke logon ko saath lekar kam sankhya main bahu-seva kaman main badalanaa hona chahiktit main teen sarkari samitiyon ne oefbi ke korporetigeshan kaa suzav diya tha
 In 2000, T

 nair samiti ne oefbi ko aayudh factory korporation limited main badalane kii sifarish kii thi
 a similar outline was introduced by the Vijay Kelkar Committee in 2004
 2015 main, vaais admiral raman puri samiti ne oefbi ko korporate kii shakl dekar use teen yaa chaar khandon main vibhajit karne kaa suzav diya tha, jinamein har khand ko‚Äîhathiyaar, gola-barood, ladaaku vaahan nirmaan main se kisi bhi ek kshetra main visheshgyata hooefabi ke utpaadon ke saath gunvattta or mulya ke zyada hone jaise masale hote hai kyonki ise order nomination ke jariye milte hai na ki bazaar kii pratispardhaa ke jariye
 Improvement in price and quality should be a priority and what needs to be done is that India needs a national security policy, in which the political actors of the country define the national security goals
 sashastr balon ke liye ranneeti yaheen se aage badhegi
 In the absence of political or military strategy, any reform would be a roadmap leading to an unintended destination
 The government should consider Vijay Kelkar Committee's suggestion of dividing the OFB into three groups
 inamen ek samooh jo visphotak or gola-barood kaa nirmaan karata he, use sarkari niyantran main banaae rakhana chahie; doosraa, bakhtarband vaahanon or topakhana kii jaruraton kaa saamaan banane vaala samooh ho jise nijee-saarvajanik kshetra kii saajhedaari main chalaaya ja saktaa he
 The third group making clothes, uniforms and tents can be sold to the private sector *** america main obama prashasan is baat par vichaar kar rahaa he ki kya vah rus ke saath hui sandhi se bhi aage badhkar apane parmaanu hathiyaar jakhire main katautee kar saktaa he yaa nahin
 This confidential review may be completed by the last day of this year, but some Republicans are concerned about this and believe that there may be a major reshuffle in the policy
 mangalvaar ko 41 republican seenetteron ne apane patr main obama ko chetavanee di ki congress se vichaar vimarsh kiye bina obama parmaanu niti main bada parivartan nahin karen
 On the other hand, arms control advocates say that the US is still plagued by the Cold War mentality and is thinking of nuclear deterrence

 14 lakh crore rupees as term deposits of the elderly can reduce interest rates in the monetary policy
 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been using many governments to revive the economy
 ek prayog karj ko sasta karke logon ko kharidari ke liye uksaane vaala he
 On October 4, the Reserve Bank may decide to reduce interest rates in its monetary policy
 state bank ke research kii maane to yah katautee bujurgon ke chaar karod se zyada turm diposit khaaton par milane vaale byaaj daron ko or gira sakate hai
 The competition for cheap loans is getting heavy for the elderly, the effect of the loan being cheap is that the interest rates on deposit accounts in banks are also continuously decreasing
 1 oktober se byaaj daron ko bazaar ke hisaab se tay karne kaa nayaa formula lagu ho gaya he
 Under which, as soon as the Reserve Bank will reduce its loan rate for banks, the remaining banks will also have to change the interest rate immediately
 state bank ke anumaan ke mutabik desh bhar ke bainkon main bujurgon ne kareeb 14 lakh karod rupee yani jidipi kaa saat fisadi turm diposit ke rup main jamaa he
 In the form of personal consumption expenses, their interest rate is 8 in the last six years
 1 fisadi se ghatakar 5
 Is reduced to 5 percent
 desh ke sabase bade bank state bank of india ne apane research note main kaha he ki ghatati byaaj daron ke is daur in jamaa khaaton kii byaaj dar or neeche ja sakati he
 At the same time, its effect is expected to decrease private consumption expenditure
 1 oktober se bank byaaj daron ke liye nae formula apana rahe hai
 The drawback of the old one is being told that the rate at which banks used to get loans from the Reserve Bank, that is, banks were not giving the benefit of change in repo rate to the loan holders
 ab sarkaar repo rate or tregeri bill (sarkari prapatron ke rate) jaise teen vikalpon ko milakar rate tay hoga
 This new rate formula is called repo rate linking rate (RLLR)
 bank ab apane nijee base rate or jamaa laagat ke aadhaar par pehle kii tarah lone par byaaj kii daren tay nahin karenge
 The cut in interest rates has not only affected the elderly, but the total household debt
 logon ne jamkar karja liya he
 2 of domestic debt GDP in fiscal year 2017
 4 fisadi tha jo vittiya saal 2018 main 3
 9 percent
 sarkaar bainkon se lone mela lagane ko kah rahi he or bank sarkaar se aarthik mandi ko hataane ke liye tex riyaayat ke saath or sahuliyate maang rahe hai
 The State Bank's economic experts are recommending the removal of economic pressure on the elderly by reducing tax rates by giving tax concessions
 bujurgon kii bachat yojana (SCSS) main adhikt 15 lakh rupee jamaa kiye ja sakate hai
 The bank's economic research team says that the interest rate on this scheme is taxable and if 8
 6 fisadi kii byaaj dar maan kar chalem to march 2018 tak kareeb 38,663 karod rupee bujurgon ko dene hai
 If the government makes this interest rate completely tax free, then the government will incur only Rs 3092 crore in tax
 is tarah sarkaar kaa ghaataa (rajkoshiya) keval 0
 Will increase by 2 percent
 lekin sawaal he ki kya is badhate ghate ko bhi taxperes bharegaa
 In difficult economic conditions, the government and banks have limited measures
 ab chunaav ye karnaa he ki koun sa upaay janata ko kam se kam nuksaan pahunchayegaa

 The Delhi government's promise to prove false, the BJP claimed that Kejriwal, who promised to give electricity at half the rate after the MCD election, is going to increase the tariff of the power companies
