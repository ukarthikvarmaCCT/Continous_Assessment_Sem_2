 The government said on Friday that India has been ranked 88 in the list of 110 countries in terms of prosperity in a report by a London-based institute

 In a written reply to the question of Sushila Saroj, he told the Lok Sabha that based on the uniform recall period, the National Sample Survey Organization data shows that 32 percent of the urban poor in the year 1993-94
 4 tha jo varsh 2004-05 main ghatakar 25
 Done 7
 shailaja ne kaha ki baharhaal, sankhya ke maamle main shahari garibon kii taadaad badi he
 Number of urban poor in the year 1993-94 where 763
 37 lakh thi, vahiin varsh 2004-05 main yah badhkar 807

 bharat lagaataar apane padosi desh pakistan ko aatankwaad ke khilaaf kade kadam uthaane ke liye aagaah karata rahata he or aatankwaadi gatividhiyon ko samarthan dena band karne ke liye kahata rahaa he
 Now Pakistan has received this warning from the world too
 frejail stats index kii 2017 kii report main pakistan ko un 20 asafal deshon kii fehrist main rakhaa gaya he, jinhen khud kii suraksha kii chintaa kerani chahie
 Now, after joining the top 20 Frazile States of the world, Pakistan has to understand that the terrorism which it has been using for the purpose of harassing its neighboring country, has become a canker for itself
 yah index isi ore ishaara karata he
 America's warning to PAK America has also been warning Pakistan to take strong action to curb terrorist activities and eliminate terrorism from its soil
 haal hi main america kii pratinidhi sabha mempakistan ko aatankwaadi desh ghoshitkarne ke liye ek prastaav bhi pesh kiya gaya tha
 US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who recently visited India, asked the Pakistani leadership to take strict action against terrorist organizations, otherwise the US will take action against Pakistan itself
 america ke raashtrapati donald trump ne yah bhi kaha tha ki pakistan aatankwaadiyon kaa surakshit thikaana bana hua he
 Not only did China get tough, but China, which supported every step of Pakistan, also included the names of many terrorist organizations of Pakistan in the joint manifesto of the recent BRICS conference held in Beijing
 jo saaf ishaara karata he ki china bhi pakistan or aatankwaad kii ore apane rukh main sakhti laa rahaa he
 Digging its own grave, the PAK is actually internal forces, conflicting mindset, military dominance, corruption and unsuitable leaders, various nationalities, increasing population, dwindling water resources and deteriorating economic conditions can itself lead to the downfall of Pakistan
 frejail stats index 2017 mempakistan 18wein paaydaan parahai
 The funniest thing is that in 2017, Pakistan has been described as the most reforming country in this direction
 aashay yah he ki puri duniya main sarvaadhik sudhaar ke prayaas karne vaale desh ke baavjood pakistan kii sthiti abhi bhi behad kharaab he
 The Most Frazil States Index 2017 report, however, also states that this improvement in Pakistan is only on a year-on-year basis
 matlab pichley varsh kii tulana main to pakistan kii sthiti main sudhaar he, lekin jaruri nahin he ki sasteneble sudhaar kii disha main bhi vah acha kar rahaa ho
 The reality is that Pakistan is moving towards catastrophe
 yadi aatankwaadi desh par pakad bana lete hai to yah sirf pakistan ke liye nahin, balki vishwa ke liye bhi khatarnaak hoga
 The rulers of Pakistan should formulate a comprehensive policy to protect the country from this danger
 mahaan tej gendbaaj glen mcgra kaa maananaa he ki australia ke barkhaast cricket coach miki arthur ke nasli pakshpaat or team main matbhed ke aarope kaaphi niraashajanak hai or inase sabit hota he ki apni team kii unhen zyada parvaah nahin thi
 Arthur had accused Australia of racial bias after being sacked from the post
 unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki unhen aisi team mili, jisamen captain maaikel clark or senior khilaadi shen watasan kii kabhi nahin patati thi
 The comments mcgra ne 'da gardian' main likhaa, arthur ke bayaan niraashajanak hai
 The racism and what he said about Watson is very unfair
 unhone kaha, maine dekha ki shen warn ne kaha he ki arthur ke bayanon se sabit hota he ki unhen australian cricket kii adhik parvaah nahin he
 i agree with this yadi vah yahi karnaa chaahate hai, to yah un par nirbhar karata he
 i am deeply disappointed by this and i think it was intentionally leaked
 mcgra ne yah bhi kaha ki australian isse ubarkar maujuuda ashes shrunkhlaa main vaapasi karenge
 He said, this is a situation in which the team unites
 kai baar jab team ko todane kii koshishen kii jaati he, to uskaa nateeja ulta hota he or khilaadi ekajute ho jate hai
 They start defending each other
 arthur ne pad se barkhaast kiye jane ke baad cricket australia par nasli pakshpaat kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 He also said that he found a team in which captain Michael Clarke and senior player Shane Watson never got along
 tippaniyan As mcgraw wrote in 'the Guardian', Arthur's statements are disappointing
 naslwad or jo unhone watasan ke bare main kaha, vah bahut anuchit he
 "I see Shane Warne saying that Arthur's statements prove that he does not care much about Australian cricket
" main isse sahamat hum
 If that's what they want to do, it depends on them
 main isse kaaphi maayoos hum or mujhe to lagata he ki yah jaanboojhkar li kiya gaya
 mcgraw also said that the Australians will overcome this and return to the current Ashes series
 unhone kaha, yah aisi sthiti he, jisamen team ekajute hoti he
 Many times when attempts are made to break the team, the result is reversed and the players are united

 There are some of the richest temples in the country, whose treasury is increasing year after year
 bhagwaan ke is badhate khajaane se bhakton kaa kalyaan ho rahaa he, kyonki desh ke ye amir mandir besahaara or garibon main apni daulat baant rahe hai
 Sai Baba of Shirdi has gone ahead in all these temples, which also broke the record of Siddhivinayak
 shiridy vaale sai baba ke darbar main jitani daulat he, utana hi sai mandir se daan bhi kiya jaataa he
 Shirdi Sai Temple, Tirupati Balaji, Siddhivinayak Temple and Vaishno Devi, these four temples topped the offerings
 pichley 4 saalon main shiridy vaale sai mandir main bhakton ne kareeb 1000 karod se zuyada kaa chadhaava diya he, jabaki mumbai ke siddhivinayak main 206 karod rupee kaa chadhaava aayaa he
 Shirdi temple donated 53 percent of the wealth in the last 4 years of offerings, while Siddhivinayak gave 13 percent of the treasury to charity in the last 4 years
 yani sai baba ne daan karne main bhi record tod diya he
 The Shirdi Sai temple also overtook the Siddhivinayak temple in terms of Mahadan
 ye sai ke naam kaa chamatkaar nahin, to or kya he?sai baba kii bhakton main aisi aasthaa he ki bhakt baba ko maalamaal kar rahe hai
 This is the reason that every year a new record of Sai's treasure is created
 saal 2012-13 main bhi sai baba par recordtod daulat barsi
 Sai Baba has unwavering faith in his devotees
 din ba din sai ke bhakton kii taadaad badhati hi ja rahi he
 The result of this unwavering faith is wealth, infinite wealth, note only note and maya only maya
 kehete hai ki sai baba ke darbar main jo aata he, vah khaali haath nahin jaataa he
 Sai listens to the wishes of his devotees and the devotees greet the Lord
 saal 2012 main saal 2011 kaa record tut gaya
 However, in 2011 the 2010 record was broken
 saal 2011 main 276 karod kaa chadhaava aayaa, jisamen is saal kareeb 30 karod kii badhotaree hui
 The question is not about the offering in the Shirdi Sai temple, but the faith and reverence of the devotees, who are showering on the devotees as Sai's blessings

 Enduring hard work and endurance in difficult circumstances is a special feature of these women
 lekin apni isi khubi kii vajah se ye adivasee auraten maovadiyon ke liye ahm ho uthin
 For two decades, the Maoists have been transforming these tribal women, not for the good of them and the region, but for the ominous and ruin
 ye sharmili adivasee auraten aaj maovadi chhapamar ke rup main khauf kaa paryaay hai or purush saathiyon ke mukaable adhik krur bhi
 The Maoists have been paying special attention to the recruitment of tribal women in their troops for the last few years
 suraksha balon kaa anumaan he ki bastar kshetra ke lagbhag 10,000 maovadiyon main kareeb 4,000 mahilaayein hai
 Of these, about 2,000 tribal women, who received military training, are part of armed guerrilla troops
 ye mahila chhapamar aae din dil dahala dene vaali vaardaaton ko anjaam de rahi hai
 There have been many incidents in recent times in which women have led the squads of Maoist guerrillas and dealt with unimaginable cruelty to the security personnel

 They were moving towards them with an ax to kill the wounded soldiers in the shootout

 It is reported that Savitri was injured in police retaliation
 isse pehle 19 agast ko metalacheru main suraksha bal par hamale ke baad mahila maovadiyon ne goliyon se ghayal javaanon ko berahami se chaaku se godakar maar daalaa tha

 Their leader was Akila of the Usur Military Platoon
 '' 10 june kii raat dantewada ke gatom main hue barudi surang visphot ko mahila chhapamaron ne hi anjaam diya
 Then 10 soldiers went to Marv
 visphot ke baad mahila maovadiyon ne vaahan main savaar ghayal javaanon ko na keval dhardaar hathiyaar se maut ke ghat utaara balki unke sharir se bandhe kaartoos ke paauch bhi katkar nikaal liye

 The Maoists roasted this fact to increase their strength

 Documents recovered by the police during the raid in the Maoists camp reveal that the Maoists had prepared tribal women of Bastar in a systematic manner
 sabase pehle krantikari adivasee mahila sanghathan khadaa kar maovadiyon ne unhen lamaband kiya
 He was then given the responsibility of propagating Maoism through the Jan Chetna Natya Mandali

 Eventually he was brought into military units after rigorous training

 And they are also forcibly getting married to their partners so that the male members of their organization do not leave them with their boring routine

 But in view of the large number of women in the Maoist contingents, the governments, security forces and local society facing the Maoist curse will have to make concrete plans to reconcile the process and bring back the tribal women back home

 maujuuda samay main yah 25 karod rupee tha
 "the official said that startups that have not invested in real estate will be eligible for the startup rebate
 iske alaava starop kaa karj kaa paimaana bhi dekha jayega
 It will be seen that the start-up vehicles and other units of more than Rs 10 lakh have not given loan and capital support

 Along with keeping the house clean, it is also important that you keep your bed clean as well

 It is necessary to change the bed cover and pillow cover at least twice a week

 Otherwise your problem will increase further

 2
 mausam ke anusaar hi bed cover kaa chunaav karen
 In summer, it is better to use cotton bed cover
 vahiin sardiyon ke liye silk yaa mote kapade ke bed cover kaa istemaal karnaa acha rahegaa
 However, the bed cover of silk or any thick fabric cover is more dirty because it contains dust and it is also difficult to wash them
 3
 Take the bed cover out as soon as you wake up every morning
 taaki usamen jamaa sari dhul or duusari gandagi saaf ho jaae
 After that, lay it on the bed in a soft manner
 pilo cover ko bhi isi tarah roj subah saaf kar len
 Place a mat near the bed so that you can wipe the feet on it before sitting on the bed
 4
 It is very important to show sunlight once a month
 isse gaddon main keede nahin panpane paaenge or unamem se kisi bhi prakaar kii gandh bhi nahin aegi

 However, according to the Kapur Commission, there is no concrete evidence about the fact that Bhilare mentioned the Panchgani incident of July 1944, even if there was any such incident
 halanki jab bhilaare ke sahyogi manishankar purohit ko kamishan ke saamne pesh kiya gaya to unhone bataaya ki yah ghatana 1944 main nahin july 1947 main hui thi
 There was no specific mention of Bhilare in this incident
 kamishan ko bas itnaa pataa chalaa ki 1944 main us din kuch logon ke kaaran prarthana sabha main ashaanti kaa maahaul banaaya gaya tha
 On 22 March 1965, a Supreme Court judge JK Kapoor set up a commission to investigate the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi
 kamishan ko yah pataa chalaa ki 1944 main gandhi ko malaria ho gaya tha
 Gandhi went to Panchgani to rest on the advice of the doctor
 panchagani main kii gai gandhi par hamale kii koshishmanibhawan gandhi sangrahalay, mumbai ke adhyaksh dhirubhai mehta ne 2008 main bataaya tha ki godse ke kisi bhai ne 1944 main panchagani main gandhi par hamalaa karne kii koshish kii thi unhone bataaya ki yah ghatana gandhi kekaribi sahyogi pyarelalake naam se darj kii gai
 Mehta told that this thing has also been written in the book of Chunnilal Mehta, who believes Gandhi
 bhilaare ne kiya jindagi bhar gandhi ke siddhanton kaa anusaranswatantraaa senaanee or varishthakisaanon or shramik partike netaa endi patil ne bataaya,' un dinon bhilaare hamaare jaise yuvaaon ke hero hua karte the
 The thing that saved Gandhi from Godse had spread throughout Satara
 tab main 15 saal kaa tha
 Then my friend Bhilare went to meet Guruji on a cycle
 unhone sari jindagi saadhaaran ji or gandhi ke siddhanton kaa anusaran kiya
 ' kehete hai jab upar vaala jab detaa he to chappar faad kar detaa he
 The same happened with Shekhar, 24, of Delhi
 shekhar ne shaayad kabhi nahin sochaa hoga ki ek phone kharidne ke badale unhen 600 gifts mil jaaenge
 Even gifts that cost up to Rs 80,000
 darasal hua kuch yun ki vanplus or amejan ne milakar haal hi main ek pramotional campan vanplus lucky star chalaaya tha
 The campaign was run on the fourth anniversary of the partnership between the two companies
 is campan ke tahat oneplus 6T kharidne vaale kisi ek lucky star ko phone ke saath-saath 600 atirikt gift bhi die jane the
 So Shekhar of Delhi was chosen for Lucky Star of this campaign
 shekhar ko jo 600 gift die gaye hai unamem furniture, applinces, gagetts, fishan accessories, refrigirator, ek laptop, kichan items, home debor items or fishan products shaamil hai
 That is, in total you can say that everything was given to Shekhar instead of buying oneplus 6T
 kamaal kii baat ye he ki 600 gifts kii list main kichan sinc tak shaamil he
 Let me tell you, it was not easy to bring 600 gifts to Shekhar
 iske liye amejan or vanplus kii ore se ek chota trek book kiya gaya
 The matter did not stop here, Vikas Aggarwal, general manager of oneplus India came to Delhi to handover the oneplus 6T to Shekhar
 har gift kii keemat kii baat karen to inaki range 100 rupee se lekar 80,000 rupee tak he
 That is, the total price of all the products is in millions
 vanplus or amejan india ke liye chaar saalon kii saajhedaari kaaphi kamaal kii rahi he
 While on one hand Amazon got the business of oneplus from a large number of oneplus fans, on the other hand the easy availability of oneplus phones helped the company to get hold of the premium segment
 market research ferms ke mutabik, pichhali teen timahiyon se vanplus bhartiya premium market main top smartphone brands he
 Here the company is ahead of companies like Samsung and Apple

 5 the fire is buried in the ashes, the groaning has been heard right now, every moment it is heard in the throat like a voice, a scream in the chest is angry, a life, i have to tell you what a wonderful thing it is
 chambal ke gaanv main ek ladki
 Born in the Thakurs' home
 baap ko ladkaa chahie tha
 If the desire was not born, then part of what happened was justified in a vulgar manner
 phir gaanv kii partibandi main baap ko ek duusare thakur ne maar diya
 Mara and then that Thakur started climbing on the woman of the deceased in the words of the girl
 ladki se ye ghinaapan bardaasht nahin hua or ek din usne baap kii sixsar (chah round vaali revolver) kii sari goliyaan hatyare ke jism main utaar hatya kii bohani kar di
 This was the real birth of Revolver Rani Alka Singh (kangana Runot)
 is cond ke baad uske balli mamaa (piyush mishra) aae or use apane saath dabra (madhya pradesh kaa ek kasbaa) le gaye
 Now his maternal uncle was his parents
 mamaa ne karine se 25 saal tak vyuh rachana kii
 As a result, Alka Singh became the famous Bahubali of Gwalior division
 ek baar vidhayak or mantri bhi bani, magar phir chunaav haar gai
 Jeet Udaybhan Singh Tomar (zakir Hussain), another Bahubali
 magar tomaron ko jeet ke baad bhi ek kasak thi
 Alka, who was 24 murdered, killed her brother and still the holiday is on
 badla lone ke liye tomars alka ke gudda yani lover boy rohan ko mumbai se uthaa lete hai
 Rohan is cutting Ash on Alka's money in the name of allegedly becoming a hero
 rohan alka ke akkhad jangal main raat kii rani kii tarah mahakaa tha
 He had thought to make Alka a ladder, but the love of the woman within Alka grew to see this Gabru
 or jab lover dushman ke paas ho to alka ke bheetar kii durga kaa jaagnaa tay tha
 From here a second state of politics started laying
 tomars waar karte, to balli mamaa alka ko aage rakh palatwaar
 Alka's metamorphosis continued among them all
 junglee sherni gurrana bhul gai kyonki uske bheetar kii aurat jo aadamiyon se bhidate dabochate unheen si ho gai thi waapas apane aadim rup main lautne lagi
 And in such a situation, he had to face all the vengeance
 kangana is film ke saath bollywood kii queen nahin superqueen ho gai hai
 Like the loafers' jowls, the revolver waving fire in both hands, Alka's Bhokal and Tevar, the Red Mirchi Rayetas of Bundelkhand sound sensational like 'sanata'
 phir jab uttarardh main uski jameen nam hoti he or is par pyaar or mamatv ke ankhue footne shuru hote hai, to uske saath hi maathe par laal suraj si bindi or ankhon main jharnaa footataa dikhataa he
 This girl has done amazing acting
 meri bin maangi munhfat salaah, bollywood kii sabhi kathith actress ko
 Watch and learn this girl's work again and again
 vir das ne bhi kamingi kaa nayaa muhaavara gadha he apane kirdaar ke jariye
 For the first time, he has come out of his standup comedian's reel and real avatar and has done well
 balli mamaa ke rup main piyush mishra us samantvaadi rishte kii kai baarikiyaan bunate hai, jo kabhi pyaar-dulaar to kabhi dutkaar ke jariye apni sajishon ko auraton ke sahare anjaam detaa rahata he
 He is also reminiscent of Gangs of Wasseypur at times, which in my view was a classic film
 jakir hossain or duusare actors kaa chunaav bhi shandaar rahaa
 i would like to mention here that the actress Mishka Singh, who comes in at regular intervals in the film and laughed off her bold style and dialogue
 local news channel kii masaaledaar andaaj main news padhati ankar priyanka parihaar kaa role unhone kamaal kaa nibhaayaa he
 The story of the film is tight
 dialog pital si chamak or matthey si gamak liye thasakdaar hai
 Seeing the story-screenplay and direction of director Sai Kabir, it does not seem that this is his debut film
 film main ection he, kamedi he, suspence he or sthiti ke mutabik gane bhi hai, jo kahin se bhi film ke bhav ko halkaa nahin padane dete
 You have to talk on songs separately
 bhale hi rivyuu kii naap bad jaae
 The title Song Revolver Rani comes in Usha Uthap's voice and you dives into the world of Tarantino
 bhadkile rangon ke bich kuch sketch film kii prishthbhumi rachate hai
 Humming these lines in your mind is part of poisonous tannum
 ye shahar e jahannum kaa kissa he
 The queen was one of the protagonists
 baroodon kaa wo pikar pani
 That plate was born in the cradle of stones
 revolver rani kii thany thanyaharfanmaulaa kalakaar piyush mishra ne isi tarj ko duusare dhang se gadha he gane, thany kare thakka, dhakk tani se main
 Line comes forward in this, Randebaazi here is Rani's police station revolver, Ho Bhaga Romeo Poor, with heart on his hand
 ye ek mafia queen ke gudde kii haalat dikhaati he
 Similarly, there is a song made of mud made of mud, there is not enough moon, for us now, eyes are craving for you right now, we are not waiting desperately, this night has also stopped for you
 ab sochie is gane ko jab aashaa tai ne gaaya hoga to kya khanak paidaa hui hogi parde par
 Apart from this, the song Chala Lade Re Bhaiya, which came in the style of Alha, came out
 chal lade re bhaiya dhoop khili film omkara kii yaad dilaataa he
 The film also has a song by Desaj Andaz, which has lyrics
 alka ko lene aae banna ji re dekho
 The procession is of dreams
 phool jaraa ji phenko
 This is Rohan, Mohan is of Banni Rani
 desi ke ulat alka singh kii sena ke sipaahi payalat urf maaikel jackson kaa gaanaa aay em note bed
 i Am Brutal My Baby
 ai vil it you like noodle maai bebe bhi he
 The tagline of the film is, now man will have pain
 iskaa prakat mantavya ye jaan padataa he ki ek beraham khunriji aurat jaalim jamaane se badla legi
 However, there is another meaning hidden in the womb of these words
 mard ko dard hoga or hona bhi chahie is blike kamedi, trgidi ko dekhakar
 The pain of how a woman is given a throne as long as the pawn remains
 magar jaise hi vah apni kentul utaar asal swaroop main aati he, purushon ko bhay lagane lagata he
 They all mobilize, to dig the tomb of his freedom and desires
 revolver rani jaisi dikhti he, sirf waisi film nahin he
 It is a narrative of our times, our society in many respects, and with postmortem the brutal but necessarily blackened truth
 film main chunki goliyaan hai, gaaliyaan hai, isliye ho saktaa he ki parivaar ke saath jane ke lihaaj se yah bahut acha opshan sabit na ho
 But i think that these bullets and abuses are the truth of our times
 jab sach main inase nahin batch sakate, to parde par batch kya karnaa
 Anyway the censor board's beep retains the perceived restraint
 revolver rani jarur dekhie
 It is a new and arousing confidence in Hindi cinema

 ' sukama ke police adheekshak se kai koshishon ke baad bhi sampark nahin ho sakaa
 In December last year, Aitaram Mandavi held a press conference in Raipur for fear of arrest
 vahaan usne aam aadmi party kii sadsyta bhi lee

 par vah prem ko bhi samajhate hai, vah bhi is rup main kii usapar itani uttam kavitaayen likh den
 
 
 It can be understood by one who has true love or has read Khalil Gibran by drowning
 yah koi achraj kii baat nahin ki buddha kii tarah hi khalil jibran apni sukhtiyon, vichaaron or kavitaaon se osho tak ko prabhavit kiya tha
 Two best poems on the love of Khalil Gibran for the readers of Sahitya Aaj Tak - Prem 1
 prem kisi par niyantran nahin rakhatan hi prem par kisi kaa niyantran hota haitab almitra ne kaha,hamen prem ke vishay main bataaotab usne apana sir uthayaor un logon kii ore dekhoun sabon par shanti baras padhiphir usne gambhir swar main kahaprem kaa sanket milte hi anugami ban jaao uskaahaalanki uske raste kathin or durgam hanore jab uski bahen gheren tumhensamarpan kar dohalanki uske pankhons main chhipe talwartumhen lahooluhaan kar sakate hai, phir bhior jab vah shabdon main prakat housamen vishwaas rakhohalanki uske shabd tumhaare sapanom kotaar-taar kar sakate hanjaise uttari barfili hawa upavan cobarabad kar detii he
 Because if love can make you an emperor, then you can also take your sacrifice
 prem kabhi detaa he vistaarato kabhi kaat detaa he par
 Just as he rises to your summit and saves the softest orator trembling in the sun, he descends to your depths and shakes your roots from the ground
 Like a grain of grain, he gathers you for himself
 He puts you in the instrument
 Get out of your cover
 vah chaanta he tumhenore tumhaare aavaran se mukt karata he tumhenwah pisata he tumhen, ujjwal banane ko
 He knocks you, till you soften and then entrusts you to your holy fire from where you can become the holy bread of the holy communion of God! Love will do all this with you so that you can understand the mysteries of the heart and only with this 'knowledge' can you make the heart of existence Will be a fraction of lekin yadi tum bhaybheet hoor tum prem main sirf shanti or anand chaahate hoto tumhaare liye yahi acha hoga kshapani 'niztaa' ko dhak loor prem ke us yatnaa-sthal se baahar chale jaochale jaao rituhin us duniya menjahan tumhaari hansi mentumhaari sampurna khushi prakat nahin hotin hi tumhaare rudan mentumhaare sampurna ansu hi behate hamprem na to swayan ke atirikt kuch detaa hain hi prem swayan ke alaava kuch letaa heprem kisi par niyantran nahin rakhatan hi prem par kisi kaa niyantran hota haichunki prem ke liye bas prem hi paryaapt he
 When you are in love, do not say that God is in my heart but say that 'I am in the heart of God'
 yah mat socho ki tum prem kouski raah bataa sakate hobalki yadi prem tumhen yogya samajhegato vah swayan tumhen tumhaara rasta batayega'swayan' kii paripurnataa ke atiriktprem kii koi or abhilaashaa nahilekin yadi tum prem karte hophir bhi icchhaaen hon hito unka roopantaran aise karoki ye pighalkar us jharne kii tarah bahejo madhur swar main ga rahi ho raatri ke liekarunaa ke atirek kii pidaa samajhane coprem ke bodh se swayan ko ghayal hone dobahane do apana rakshapani hi ichha se saharshasubah aise jaago kihruday udne main ho samarthaor anugrihit ho ek aurpyar-bhare din ke liedopaher vishram-bharaa or prem kebhavatirek se samadhisth hoor shaam ko kritagyatapurvakghar laut jaoiske uparaant so janaa hapriyatam ke liehruday main prarthana or othon paraprashansa kaa geet liye hue
 - Original work: Khalil Gibran - Translation: Vijayalakshmi Sharma 2
 jab prem tumhen bulaaye, uske saath jaao,chaahe uskaa maarg kathor or behad kathin hi kyon na ho
 And when its wings engulf you, join them
 haalanki uske pankhons main chhipi talwaar tumhen ghayal kar sakati he
 And when he encounters you, believe him, why not let his voice scatter your dreams like the North wind ruins the garden
 yadi prem tumhe taj pahanaataa he to yah tumhen saleeb par bhi latakaayegaa,yadi yah tumhen bada karata he to yah tumhaari kaat-chhaant bhi karegaa
 Just as it reaches your height, it bares the soft branches trembling in the sun, similarly it descends to your roots and shakes them from the ground
 yah tumhen makke kii puliyon kii tarah apane main sametataa he,niraavaran kar dene ke liye tumhen kutata he
 It frees you from your peels
 yah tumhen pisata he ujalepan ke liyeyah tumhen tab tak goonthta he jab tak tum iktaar nahin ho jate
 And then it will pour you into its holy fire, so that you may become its holy bread in God's holy feast
 yah sabhi chijen tumhen prem dengi taaki tum apane dil ke raaj jaan sako,or yah gyaan zindagi ke dil kaa tukdaa banegaa
 But if you only seek the peace of love and the pleasure of love in your fear, then it will be good for you to cover your nakedness and get out of the ground of love
 mausam-viheen sansar main tum hansoge,par tumhaari sampoorn hansi nahin, or rooge, par tumhaare sampoorn aansu nahiprem swayan ke sivaa kuch nahin degaa or kuch nahin legaa swayan se
 Love does not control nor can it be controlled; it is enough to be in love for love
 jab tum prem main hoge tab tumhen nahin kahana chaiye‘bhagwaan mere dil main he’ tumhen kahana chaiye ‘main bhagwaan ke dil main hoon
 'and don't think that you can go straight to love, for love, if he finds you amol, then he will come directly to you
 prem kii swayan ko sampoorn karne ke sivaa koi khwaahish nahin hoti
 But if you love and want to aspire, then make them your wish: melt and soak like a small river that recites its music at night
 bahut adhik prem kaa dard jaano
 Injury yourself with the understanding of your love, and gladly bury yourself
 subah utho khule dil ke sathor ek or achche din ke liye shukriya kaho;shaam ko aaraam karte hueor prem ke anand kaa dhyaan karte hue;ahsaan ke saath ghar waapas lauto;or phir so jaao ek prarthana ke saath un priyajanon ke liyejo tumhaare dilon main rahete hanore apane honton par prem kaa gaanaa gaate hue

 unhone kaha ki vah congress ummidavaaron kii haar sunishchit karne ke liye uttar pradesh sahit un rajyon kaa bhi daura karenge, jahaan chunaav hone ja rahe hai
 Ramdev told reporters after organizing a yoga camp at the police ground that a third front would be formed before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections

 He said that both are not serious about reducing the prices of essential commodities
 baat dashak bhar pehle kii he
 Rajkumar Bulchandani used to run a paan shop at the Bundi bus stand with his brother
 parivaar kii mali haalat khaas acchhee nahin thi jiske chalate ve puraani bundi main sindhi camp ke sarkari awaas main rahakar din kaat rahe the
 He got a license to supply diesel in the mining sector due to his efforts to get rid of poverty
 ek din vyapaar ke silsile main ve budhpura gaye to shakkargarh nivasee si
 P
 mandovara ne unhen cobal ke bare main bataaya
 Just, with his inspiration, he got into this business in such a way that there was no need to look back
 5,000 se 6,000 ru
 Bulchandani with a monthly income is now Rs 1 crore a year
 se zyada ke kaarobaari seth hai
 He also owns a private house and car in Bundi
 ve cobal vyapaar sangh, bundi ke adhyaksh bhi hai
 There is no dearth in the real stories of success related to the cobble, who played the role of a philosopher's stone in the lives of people and the creator of a major change
 dedh dashak pehle tak pradesh ke khanan ilaakon main sandstone ke jin tukdon ko phaltu kachra mana jaataa tha, vahi aaj sona barasaa rahaa he
 After all, what happened to the garbage that started raining gold? The story of this change starts from the time when some countries started using cobbles in building roads, footpaths and many others, which led to an increase in its exports
 maujuuda daur main germany, france or belgium samet kai europea deshon or bangladesh main isaki maang jabardast rup se badi he
 This is the reason why the industry of making cobble has taken a big form in Dabi and Budhpura areas of Bundi
 cobal ne logon kaa jivan badla, yahaan tak to thik
 But the question arises that what the hell is this cable? Usually, after removing the sandstone from the mines, some pieces of stone are left, whose tiles are not made
 kuch samay pehle tak pattharon ke in tukdon ko kooda maanakar malbe ke saath dafan kar diya jaataa tha
 Because of this, large mountains of debris were erected in the mined areas
 lekin 1990 main chandraprakash mandovara ne cobal banaakar cobal vyapaar kii neenv daali or 1992 aate-aate iskaa videshon main niryaat hone laga
 Roads and pavements were made of these pieces in places of moisture
 kai deshon main inkaa prayog safal rahaa to in tukdon kii bhi chal nikali
 Currently, six to six inch size cobbles are being cut and exported
 inke alaava chaar-paanch chote-bade aakaaron main bhi cobal taiyaar hote hai, jisaki kaaphi maang he
 Rameshwar Mandovara, brother of the late Chandraprakash and Vishal Mandovara (c
) Of the late Chandraprakash who laid the foundation of the cobble trade in Bundi, Bhilwara and the surrounding areas
 pi
 The sons of Mandovara) are offering this trade
 vishaal bataate hai, ''pitaaji nabbe ke dashak main europe main kisi meley main gaye the, jahaan kisi videshi kharidaar ne unhen sandstone ke cobal banane kaa idia diya tha
 After coming to India, he left his job and brought artisans from Jaipur and started making cobbles on the lines of granite
 1993 main pehla container belgium bheja gaya
 After this, there was such demand abroad that more than one thousand containers are sent to many European countries including France, Belgium and Germany annually
 '' ab vishaal, unke taoojee rameshwar mandovara or unka betaa is vyapaar ko sambhaal rahe hai
 Rajkumar Bulchandani, president of Cobbles Construction Association, Bundi, states that about 1,000 truckloads of goods are released every month from the mining area of the district
 ek trek main takreeban 28 ton maal aata he
 He explains, "the local rate of cobble is Rs
 1,200-1,300
 prati ton he, jabaki videshon main isaki keemat 4,500 ru
 Per ton
 ''hamaare desh main footpath banane ke liye cement ke blox chalan main hai
 But there is more demand for cobbles abroad
 adhik pani or shunya se kam taapmaana vaale in deshon main jahaan baar-baar sadaken tootna aam baat he, cobal ke upyog se achche nattejey saamne aae hai
 People's life has really changed with the start of manufacture and export of cobble in this entire division of the state, especially Bundi
 is par 'aam ke aam guthliyon ke daam' kahawat bhi bakhubi lagu ho rahi he kyonki mul khanij padaarth ke baad bachaa kachra sona sabit ho rahaa he
 It has helped immensely in the field of environmental protection
 is ilaake main malbe ke kritrim pahaado ke dher ab chote hone lage hai
 In the last ten years, there was so much here that there was no space left
 bade khanan kaarobaariyon ke baad is kachare kii vajah se kai chote udhyami bhi punap aae hai jo khan maalikon se is kachare ko kharid kar cobal banaakar chaandi kaat rahe hai
 Thousands of handicraftsmen, stone cutters and laborers have also got employment from it
 aise hi ek shaks kedaar gupta hai jo cobal vyapaar sangh, bundi ke sachiv hai
 He used to work as an in-charge in a stone company before 2000, he used to get a living wage
 ve cobal vyapaar main kya aae, unka puraa jivan hi badal gaya
 He now has offices in Budhpura and Kota and has an annual turnover of Rs 1 crore
 ko paar kar chukaa he
 He says, "due to increasing exports in the cobble trade, hard work has reduced and life is becoming very easy
 ''bundi ke barad khanan kshetra or bhilwara ke ilaake main sirf cobal ko lekar takreeban 100 karod ru
 Is traded annually
 mjedaar baat yah ki shuruaati teen saal main cobal roylty mukt rahaa
 Then around 1998 Rs 5
 prati ton se roylty shuru hui, jo ab 75 ru
 Per tonne
 pichley saal us samay to had hi ho gai thi, jab sarkaar ne ise 150 ru
 Per ton
 magar janvari, 2011 main 45 din tak chale andolan ke baad sarkaar ko daren ghataani padin
 Bulbandani says, "cobble has a higher royalty rate
 mul khanij padaarth (sandstone) kii tulana main cobal kii daren or kam honi chahie
 However, cell tax is waived on the cable
 bundi or kota main cobal banane kaa kaam bade paimaane par chal rahaa he
 Small Budhpura village in Bundi has more than 35 stocks (open godowns)
 ''khan maalikon ko bhi isse khaasaa phayda hua he
 Now they are also taking advantage of the solution of their problem
 bhala kaise? pehle ek dashak tak kaccha maal (farshi) nickshulk miltaa tha
 The mine owners also had to get rid of the mountain of debris
 lekin cobal kii maang badhane ke kaaran ve bhi maukey kaa phayda uthaakar kachare kii keemat vasuulne lage hai
 Rameshwar Mandovra said, "happily, there is a great demand for goods (cobble)
" itani ki 60 fisadi order pending hai
 Bundi and Kota have learned the lesson of how waste is converted into gold
 ab yahaan cobal ke kai niryaatak ho gaye hai to vahiin ek lakh mazdooron ko rojgaar bhi mil rahaa he

 The murder case is from Connaught Place, Delhi, 14 mobiles and 2 laptops recovered from the accused
 The Delhi Police has arrested 2 accused in solving the murder case in just 12 hours
 maamla dilli ke dil conot place kaa he
 Actually a young man was murdered in Connaught Place area
 police ne hatya ke aarope main 2 aropiyon ko giraftaar kiya he
 Police have provided 14 mobile phones and 2 laptops to these two accused
 police ke mutabik aropiyon ke naam meggi or prem he jo dilli ke mandavali ilaake main rahete hai
 But often, both of them used to enter the Selter Home near Bangla Saheb Gurdwara in Connaught Place late at night and spend their nights there
 usee shelter home main rahane vaala ek yuvak praveen inkaa virodh karata tha
 Angered by this, late on Sunday night, both of them killed Pravin with a knife and brick
 nai dilli ke disipi ish singhl ke mutabik police ne sisitivi or mritak ke ghayal avasthaa main die bayanon ke aadhaar par aropiyon ko giraftaar kar liya he
 On the basis of the same recovered from them, the police is ascertaining whether these two accused are robbers or involved in any other crime

 aakhirkaar arvind kejariwal dilli ke mukhyamantri ban hi gaye
 This is an incident which could not have been imagined three months before today
 yah vartmaan raajnneetik vyavastha ke viruddh ek bada vidroh he
 It is a conduit against corruption, inertia and neglect whose tone will resonate far and wide
 janata sarvopari he, yah baat rajaneta bhoolatey ja rahe hai
 The government of the people formed in a short time is in power today
 loktantr ke liye yah ek bada shubh din he kyonki aaj uski chamak sari duniya dekh rahi he
 Now Arvind Kejriwal faces a mountain of challenges
 unhone janata ke saamne ummiido ke jo lakhon diye jalaae hai unki roshni banaae rakhana koi aasaan kaam nahin he
 Every man has high expectations from the common man and now it is to see how Arvind Kejriwal is able to fulfill it
 unhone apane ghoshnaa patr main kai aisi baaten rakhi hai jinhen puraa karne main unki har baar agnipariksha hogi
 It will be a matter of interest and pleasure to see how much this government will be able to do based on the support of others
 dilli darasal ek adhakachara sa rajya he jiske paas police or jameen ke adhikaar nahin hai
 Here every time one has to take permission from the Central Government to take every major decision
 aise main lau and order sudhaarney or jhuggiyon main rahane vaale lakhon majaboor logon ko chat dilaane ke bade vaade kaise puure honge? ghate main chal rahi nagar nigamon ke hajaaron safaikarmiyon ko kaise niyamit kiya jayega? mahangaai par kaabo karne kaa tarika kya hoga?ab arvind kejariwal ne bhi shapath lene ke baad do took shabdon main kah diya he ki unke paas jaadu kii koi chadi nahin he
 This means that people will have to wait for solutions to their problems
 ab yahaan se hi samasya shuru hoti he
 Those who left everything and joined the Aam Aadmi Party, how long will they be able to wait? How long will their patience be tied? The truth is that it will all depend on the attitude of the opposition parties
 ve kitne dinon tak sarkaar chalane dete hai or kaise chalane dete hai, us par kaaphi kuch nirbhar karegaa
 However, this new and a revolutionary type of government is welcome
 ham yahi ummid kar sakate hai ki nae siem arvind kejariwal kam sroton or kam samay main kuch acha jarur kar dikhaaenge

 While there is a situation of Confusion on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, there is a strange uneasiness in the leaders and political world
 centre sarkaar kii adwijuri ke baad amarnath yatri or sailaani aanan-fanan main ghati chhodkar laut rahe hai
 Meanwhile, former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) President Mehbooba Mufti has expressed concern over the situation in Kashmir
 mahabuuba mufti ne centre sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki yatriyon, paryatakon or chaatro ko kashmir se jane ko kaha gaya he, kashmiriyon ko raahat dene kii koshish nahin kii ja rahi he
 Mehbooba Mufti took a dig at Prime Minister Modi and said, "where have humanity, Kashmiriyat and Jamuriyat? Evacuate yatris, tourists, labourers, students & cricketers
" Willingly create a sense of panic & distress but don’t bother giving Kashmiris a sense of relief or security

 Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti said that we want to tell the Central Government that the consequences of tampering with Article 370 and Article 35A will be very dangerous
 hamane baat karne kii koshish kii, lekin bharat sarkaar kii taraf se koi jawaab nahin mil rahaa he
 People are nervous
 sarkaar baat karnaa nahin chaahati
 Mehbooba Mufti said, the central government should clarify this
 hamane sabhi kshetreey partiyon baithkar baat karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 So we decided to sit in the hotel
 police ne hotel ko adwijuri jari kii he or raajnneetik dalon kii baithak par roak laga di he
 So we had to cancel the meeting from the hotel and keep it at our house at 6 pm

 ) khubasurat mahilaon se baat karne se pehle ek baar jarur soch len kyonki khubasurat mahilaon ke saath baat karne se purushon ke dimag kii batti gul ho jaati he
 In a new study, it has been revealed that while talking to beautiful women, the light of the brain of the men gets flushed
 purush baat karne ke dauraan bahut dimag lagaate henholland main adhyayankartaaon ne paaya ki jab koi purush kisi aakshark mahila se baatcheet karata he to yah sachmuch main uske dimag kii batti gul kar detaa he
 The result that has come out in this study can definitely show its effect on the work of people who 'flirt' with women at the workplace
 ‘da daily telegraph’ main prakashit report ke mutabik adhyayankartaaon ne bataaya ki iskaa kaaran yah ho saktaa he ki purush khubasurat mahilaon se baat karne ke dauraan bahut adhik dimag lagaataa he or is tarah unke paas anya kaary karne ke liye bahut kam urja bachati he
 Conversely no effect on women; Conversely, interacting with attractive men does not affect women
 purush aage ke avasaron ke bare main zyada sochate hai
 This happens to them
 adhyayan main bataaya gaya he ki kisi company main ek khubasurat mahila ke saath kuch minute kaa vakt bitaane vaala purush us vyakti kii tulana main kam acha kaam karata he, jo kisi saamaanya dikhne vaali mahila ke saath vakt bitaata he
 "as a conclusion, we can say that after talking to an attractive woman, there may be a temporary decrease in the mental response of men," the study reported by Radbound University
 ’’ The BJP has emerged as the largest party in the Karnataka elections
 lekin abhi bhi wo jaadui aankade 112 se 4 kadam dur he
 In such a situation, the bjp's way to form a government is also not easy
 darasal agar congress+jedies ke aankade 112 tak pahunch jate hai to phir bijepi ko rokane ke liecongressdo formule par apni takat jhonk degi
 The first Congress would like the JDS to support it by forgetting all the grievances
 is kadi main agar jedies siddharmaiya ke naam par asahmat hoti he to congress bina der kiye jedies kii pasand vaale congressi siem par muhar laga degi
 The second formula is that the JDS is also seen winning about 40 seats, and the Congress has weakened this time compared to the last election
 aise main agar jedies apana mukhyamantri kaa daawa pesh karti he to congress is par bhi vichaar kar sakati he, kyonki bhale hi siem kii kursi jedies ke paas hogi, lekin congress apni ranneeti par kaamyaab rahegi
 In any case, the Congress wants to keep BJP away from power
 congress somvaar se hi karnataka main sarkaar banane ke liye plan-bi main jute gai he
 The same Congress leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and Ashok Gehlot reached Bangalore on Monday
 kaha ja rahaa he ki congress jedies pramukh or purvapradhanmantri echdi devgaudaake saath sampark main he
 But the Congress will get a chance to form a government or become a partner in the government only when the BJP will not be able to form the government on its own
 iske alaava agar jedies bijepi ko samarthan dene se manaa kar de
 But till the time the complete figures are reached, only speculation can be done
 is bich bijepi ne bhi plan-bi par bhi kaam karnaa shuru kar diya he
 If the BJP stays away from a majority, then there will be an attempt to form a government by taking the independent mlas together
 lekin aankade nirdaleey vidhayakon ko saath lene par bhi nahin puure hone kii sthiti mengediesko saath laana jaruri ho jayega
 In this series, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar has left for Bengaluru after meeting BJP President Amit Shah

 No matter how vigorous the Congress party is, the NRC process is not going to stop in the interest of the country

 Shah said that the economy was divided in the government of Rahul Baba's party, national security collapsed, the government of raja-maharaja and industrialists ruled in Madhya Pradesh, on what basis Rahul Baba will seek votes from the public
 bijepi adhyaksh ne kaha ki madhyapradesh main BJP kii sarkaar se pehle shriman bantaadhaar kaa shashan tha
 Shah said that earlier the UPA government at the Center did not give money to the state governments of the BJP for development
 unhone kaha ki aaj desh kaa sammaan badha he, pradhanmantri duniya main jahaan par bhi jate hai vahaan sirf modi-modi ke naare lagate hai

 ) The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has summoned the Chief Secretary of five states for the rising pollution levels in Delhi and adjoining states
 upi, punjab, haryana, rajasthan or dilli ke mukhya sachiv or krishi sachiv ko 14 november ko court main pesh hone ke nirdesh die hai
 The court said that there is an emergency like situation in the surrounding states, including Delhi, due to pollution, therefore, there is a need to hold a hearing in this matter so that pollution can be controlled

 engiti sunwaayee ke dauraan krishi mantralay or centre sarkaar ke ab tak ke pradooshan ko lekar kiye gaye prayaason or upayon par nakhushi bhi jataai
 The court said that the efforts that have been made so far have not stopped the pollution, so the problem lies there and it has become a compulsion for people to face pollution
 court kaa maananaa tha ki krishi mantralay or centre kii taraf se pradooshan ke maddenjar jo bhi monitering kii gai, wo bhi santoshjanak nahin rahi
 The court said that the common people who are contributing to save the environment, they should get incentives so that others who have seen them are encouraged to contribute their help in curbing pollution
 saath hi ve log jo paryaavaran ko bachaane or pradooshan ko kam karne main apana koi sahyog nahin kar rahe hai, unako wo suvidhaayen or incentives nahin milane chahie
 On November 15, the NGT will hear the matter again and the Chief Secretary of five states including Delhi will have to tell before the court what effective steps the state government has taken so far to curb pollution

 Salman, Salman, Salman
 
 
 ye 3 chijen hi dabang 3 main 2 ghante 45 minute tak najar aaengi
 So it is certain that if you are a fan of Salman, then you will not see any deficiency in the film
 lekin ek behtareen film kii relies kaa intjaar weekend ko shandaar banane ke liye kar rahe hai to sanbhal jaaen ye film dimag main khichdi pakaa degi
 Salman's dialogue is enough to explain that we do not understand at heart
 film kii kahanefilm kii kahani inspector dhakad pandey (salmaan khan) se shuru hoti he
 Who later becomes Chulbul Pandey
 film kii kahani main beeti dabang part kii tarah flashbag he
 Therefore, if you understand the film directly, then a common boy who is superfit but is denied to the family
 use maa or pita to bahut pyaar karte hai lekin ghar main maujuud sulochana mausi sirf taane maarthi hai
 Dhakad has a brother, Makkhi (arbaaz Khan) who runs at the behest of his brother
 kahani aage badhati he or dhakad ko khushi (sai manjrekar) se pyaar ho jaataa he
 Both of their families get ready for marriage
 lekin tabhi khushi par bali (kichcha sudeep) kii najar padati he
 He loves her one-sided but when she learns about the love of Rakshasa and Khushi, Khushi kills the entire family including Raksha
 lekin mukadmaa chalata he dhakad par or milti he sajaa
 Meanwhile, the senior officer of the jail turns his attention on Dhakad and acquits Dhakad of false charges and makes him a policeman
 yahaan dhakad pandey kaa rup badal jaataa he or wo chulbul pandey ban jate hai
 Chulbul Pandey kills Bali by throwing him from the ditch to complete his revenge
 iske baad kahani main aata he jump, chulbul kii mulaakaat hoti he rajjo (sonakshi sinha) se
 The two fall in love and then get married, they also have a son, who is around 6 years old
 lekin kahani main aage bali kii phir entry hoti he jo kaise batch gaya iskaa film main zikr bhi nahin he
 One day both Bali and Dhakar again collide
 bali bhi apana badla bhuulaa nahin he
 He feels that Chulbul has taken away Khushi
 chulbul kaa purana dard jaag jaataa he
 Bali does more wrongdoing than before
 use khatm karne ke liye chulbul pandey kasam lete hai lekin unka khaatmaa kaise hoga? yaa bali phir batch jayega yahi film kaa clymex he
 In the acting film, Salman Khan is looking younger than ever in his old style
 acting ke maamle main salmaan kaa andaaj bhale purana he lekin parde par dabang andaaj main unki entry darshakon ko sitiyaan or taaliyaan bajaane par majaboor kar detii he
 In the film, Sonakshi is like a character in her character
 haalanki dabang kii bivi kaa kirdaar unhone acha nibhaayaa he
 Sai Manjrekar, who became Chulbul's girlfriend, has debuted in the film
 sai ne sidhi saadi ladki ke kirdaar main thik thaak kaam kiya he
 Kicha Sudeep has done a fantastic job in the role of Villain in the film
 dabang jaise hero ke aage bali jaise villen ke kirdaar ko kichcha sudeep ne shandaar tareeke se nibhaayaa he
 There are many supporting artists in the film, Arbaaz Khan, Nawab Shah, Mahesh Manjrekar have done a good job

 In action, Salman Khan has tried his best to compete with South's films
 jo kaamyaab bhi he
 vfx's work in the film is tremendous
 salmaan ko jawan dikhaane main mechap artist ne behtareen kaam kiya he
 The best thing in the movie is its songs
 khaastaur se munna badnaam hua
 Salman Khan has given full competition to Malaika's Munni Badnaam
 film ke duusare gane bhi sune ja sakate hai lekin koi esa gaanaa nahin he jisaki dhun or bol aap gunagunaate hue theatre se baahar nikalate najar aaen
 If you remove the X-ray of Dabangg 3 then there is nothing to see in the film
 ye mahaj puraani filmon ko nikaalkar nayaa karke pesh kiye jane kii koshish he
 For Salman Khan's fan, this film may be a blockbuster but if you look at Salman's old films, it is not that bigoted
 isliye film ke box offis par asar padana bhi tay he
 There has been a backlash from all over the country for the assault on shopkeepers living in Kashmir in Lucknow and people are condemning it

 Bank officials told NDTV India that the amount of hold was placed in Sheetal's account xxrep 9 9 and he had only about 600 rupees in his account, so due to the check from ATM, he showed it in the balance negative which he accepted as the deposit in his account And this led to all the misunderstanding

 sarkaar ne sena pramukh general wike singh kii umr ko lekar kai maheenon se jari vivaad par purna viraam lagaate hue unki janm tithi 10 may, 1950 maani he or ab unhen agle saal may main sevanivrutt hona he
 Sources said that the Ministry of Defense has taken this decision based on the opinion of the Attorney General and Law Ministry and the decision was conveyed to the Army Chief on Thursday
 sarvice ricard main sena pramukh kii do janm tithiyon-10 may, 1950 tathaa 10 may, 1951 kaa pataa chalane ke baad yah vivaad khadaa hua tha
 While his date of birth in the matriculation certificate in the service record is May 10, 1951, his date of birth is written on May 10, 1950 in the UPSC application form filled for admission in the army
 sahi janmatithi kaa nirdhaaran bahut hi mahatvapurn tha, kyonki sena pramukh ke rup main singh kaa kaarykaal teen saal kaa yaa 62 saal kii umr tak hoga
 Now, assuming his birth date in May 1950, he will have to retire in May next year, because then he will be 62
 singh ne daleel di thi ki may, 1951 ko unki janm tithi maani jaae or unhone is silsile main desh ke teen purv pradhan nyaayadhishon se samarthan bhi maanga
 In view of the controversy, the Ministry of Defense sought the opinion of the Law Ministry and the Attorney General, who said that May 10, 1950 should be considered the (correct) date of birth, as it is the date of birth written in the form of UPSC
 yadi koi visangati hoti to use do saal ke andar sahi kar liya janaa chahie tha
 It is now expected that after Singh retires, he will be replaced by Lieutenant General Vikram Singh, who will be the senior most Lieutenant General at that time
 jab vivaad badhane laga tab raksha mantralay ne ek hi maheene ke antaraal par atarni general se do baar raay maangi or donon hi baar unhone kaha ki sena pramukh kii janmatithi 10 may, 1950 maani jaani chahie, kyonki rashtriya raksha academy main pravesh ke liye bhare gaye upiessi ke form main yah darj he
 The Law Ministry also stamped his opinion
 atarni general kii raay us raay se bhinn thi, jo sena ne do sevanivrutt nyaayadhishon- nyaayamurti jees verma or nyaayamurti jibi patnayak se swatantra evam nijee raay maangi thi
 Both these judges had allegedly said that on May 10, 1951, Singh's birth date should be considered
 sutron ne kaha ki sevanivruth nyaayadhishon se raay maangane ke sena pramukh ke kadam ko raksha mantralay ne pasand nahin kii

 dwadash jyotirlingon main se ek baba kedarnath ke darshan kii raah aasaan nahin, lekin baba kii ek jhalak bhi itani punyadaayi hoti he ki bhakt bas khinche chale aate hai
 It is said that without the philosophy of Kedarnath, there is no result of the philosophy of Badrinath
 barf se dhaki chotiyon ke bich bhagwaan kedarnath darshan dete hai
 Lord Kedarnath, one of the four dhams of Uttarakhand, for whom the devotees wait for the whole six months with eyelashes
 uttarakhand main himalay parvat kii god main bhagwaan kedarnath virajte hai
 Kedarnath kapatas open for just six months of darshan, in winter the kapatas are closed for devotees
 is dauraan bhagwaan ukhimath main virajte hai
 As soon as summer comes, the Lord is brought to Kedarnath with full rituals and grandeur, and then he is worshiped with full devotion
 kedarnath bhagwaan kaa ghi or makkhan se lep kiya jaataa he, taaki unke ghaav ko aaraam mili
 It is said that Lord Kedarnath did not want to see God to the Pandavas and when the Pandavas wanted to see him forcefully, he got injured in the back of God
 yahi vajah he ki aaj bhi kedarnath main bhagwaan kaa ghi auki makkhan se pujan kiya jaataa he, lekin kedarnath ke darshan kaa sidhaa yoga badrinath se judaa hua he
 It is believed that the virtue of seeing Badrinath is not attained until the devotees can see Kedarnath
 kedarnath sahit nar-narayan-murti ke darshan se sabhi tarah ke paap nasht ho jate hai
 Lord Bhairavnath is worshiped before the kapat opens and then the doors of the Lord are opened
 uske baad bhukund bhairav kii puja hoti he, jinhen kshetrapal mana jaataa he, lekin sardiyon main unka kapaat band ho jaataa he
 The belief behind this is that Narada Muni worships God alone for six months
 kedarnath bhagwaan ke darshan ke liye rudraprayag se guptkashi hokar, 20 kimi
 Further up to Gaurikund, one has to go by motorway but 14 km after that
 kii yatra paidal maarg se kerani padegi
 The whole story of Lord Kedarnath Lord Kedarnath sits at a height of eleven and a half thousand feet
 kehete hai pandavon se chhipane ke liye baba yahaan aae the, or yaheen pandavon ko kulahatya ke paap se mukti mili thi
 Kedarnath is the destination of Shiva devotees without which life is not decorated, whose devotees are longing for the vision, whose inaccessible peaks of the Himalayas do not become obstructed in the path of getting blessings, nor stone paths can create difficulties
 
 panchkedaaron main pramukh kedarnath mandir main bhagwaan shiv ke dhad rup ke darshan hote hai
 It is said that when Mahadev took the form of a buffalo to avoid the Pandavas in the Dwapar era, his torso fell here
 yah kahani dwapar yug se judi he, yah kahani pandavon se judi he
 It is said that after winning the Mahabharata war, the Pandavas wanted to wash away the sin of total murder and for this they wanted to see Lord Shiva, but Aughdadani was angry with the Pandavas and that is why he did not want to free them from giving philosophy
 tab shiv bhainsa rup dhaaran kar kedaar main chhip gaye
 The Pandavas were also firm in stubbornness, they recognized Bhainsarupi Mahadev
 kehete hai bhim ne shiv ko pakad bhi liya, lekin isi bich gutthamguttha main bhagwaan shiv antardhyaan ho gaye the par pandavon kii bhakthi or ichchhashakti ne unke hryday ko pighla diya or unhone dhad rup main prakat hokar pandavon ko darshan die
 The Pandavas got rid of sins after seeing God
 usee samay se kedarnath main bhagwaan shiv peeth kii akruti-pind ke rup main puuje jane lage
 Lord Kedarnath's head appeared in Nepal and his arms in Tungnath, Mukha Rudranath, Navel Madamsadeshwar and Jata Kalpeshwar
 isliye in chaar sthanon sahit shri kedarnath ko panchkedaar kaha jaataa he, jinaki aradhana samast paap-ksht se mukti detii he
 Lord Kedarnath's kapatas open 6 months a year for common devotees and any devotee who darshan of the Lord during this period gets the merit of many births

 18 disambar ko aane vaale nateezon se pehle share bazaar ko or achche dinon ke aane kii ummid bad gai he
 Now the question will arise in your mind, what does the market have to do with the BJP in the exit poll results of the elections of two states? Losing in Gujarat means loss
 In response to this question, futures trader Ashok Rawal says that at present The government of Gujarat is connected to the central government
 aise main agar gujarat kii sarkaar ko koi nuksaan hota he, to iskaa sidhaa asar centre kii modi sarkaar par padegaa
 This would have affected the policies of the Modi government

 Traders and investors of the stock exchange have also appreciated the work of the Modi government

 But when the exit poll results came and everyone unilaterally claimed the BJP government in Gujarat, it strengthened the sentiment
 iske alaava himachal pradesh main bhi bhaajapa kii sarkaar banati dikhaai de rahi he

 unka maananaa he ki bazaar ko pradhanmantri par bharosa ho gaya he
 At the same time the market has confidence in political instability because there is political stability, hence there is economic stability

 Advocate Nitin Satpute, appearing on behalf of Tadvi's family, alleged that the bruises showed that Tadvi was killed and therefore a case should be registered against the accused under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code

 He said, 'suicides are incited when someone deliberately wants to harm a person but the accused (in this case) only reprimanded them for their work and had no intention of harming them

 whatsap chat kaa hawala dete hue ponda ne kaha ki tadavi ne apni maa ko bataaya tha ki aspataal main koi nahin jaanata ki uski jati kya he? unhone kaha ki police keval peedita kii maa kii shikaayat par bharosa kar rahi he, jinhone is ghatana ke sambandh main teenon aropiyon kii kisi khaas bhoomika ke bare main nahin bataaya
 Another advocate for the accused, Sanjeev Bahl, told the court that the deceased was married to a doctor but instead of staying with her, she was staying in the hostel, so it may have been due to a family issue

 But this poor farmer could not repay the debt, so he thought that when there will be no life, there will be no debt

 But this did not end the debt

 Under the pressure of debt, his 35-year-old son Rajkumar also committed suicide on May 1 this year

 They clearly say that the land is ruined, there is no water, in this case, till this problem of cash crops is not broken, nothing will happen with the package
 (dekhen mehmaan kaa kollam) aankade telugana ke bhi bhayanak hai
 But even more dangerous thing is that now even news of farmer suicides has started coming from agriculture-oriented states like Punjab

 Senior Congress leaders Anand Sharma and Digvijay Singh, who had been in power at the Center for 10 years, slammed the government over farmer suicides and asked when the farmers' good days would come
 congress, samaajawaadee party or jedy (you) netaaon ne sarkaar par fasalon ke nunatam samarthan mulya ko badhaane or sasta khaad-beej dilaane kaa dabaav banaaya
 In return, the government side also presented the same figures which the UPA government had been making for 10 years
 sarkaar ne yah bhi saaf kar diya ki kisaan aatmahatya ke jitne maamle darj kiye jate hai unamem se mahaj 8
 Only 7 percent are such in which the farmer commits suicide due to problems related to farming
 yani aatmahatya karne vaale 91 fisadi kisaanon ke prati sarkaar kii koi jimmedaari nahin he
 Amidst this debate, a possible law amendment of the Modi government was also recalled, under which the attempt to commit suicide was said not to be considered a crime
 supreme court ke vakil viraag gupta poochhate hai, ‘‘anya sandarbhon ko chhod bhi den to kisaanon ke maamle main aisa faisla ghaatak bhi sabit ho saktaa he
 "on the other hand, the new government is happy that in the first six months of last year, the farmers took 1

 Kabir is a personality rather than a person
 kabir jo na hindu hai or na musalmaan
 Kabir who despite being worldly is above caste and religion
 duniya ko aainaa dikhaate kabir
 Kabir furious at the evil practices prevailing in the society
 ek aisi shakhsiyat jis par hindu or musalmaan donon daawa karte hai or vah har tarah ke jaat-paat se upar uth gaya he
 When people from all over the world go to Kashi for salvation, Kabir leaves Kashi and goes towards Maghar
 ek julahe kaa kaam karne vaala shaks jis par na jane kitne hi log doctoret kar chuke hai
 
 to isi kram main ham aapako rou-ba-rou kara rahe hai kabir ke sadabahaar dohon se, jinhen sun kar jeene kii sahi raah samaj main aati he or har mushkil aasaan lagati he
 Everyone can pray in sorrow, do it in happiness, or do others do it in happiness, we remember God only after getting hurt in all the troubles
 sukh main koi yaad nahin karata
 If you will be remembered in happiness then why will there be trouble
 bura jo dekhan main chalaa, bura na milaya koyajo man khoja aapnaa, to mujhase bura na koijab main puri duniya main kharaab or bure logon ko dekhne niklaa to mujhe koi bura nahin mila
 And what i tried to find within myself, nobody got worse than me
 bada hua to kya hua, jaise ped khajurpanthi ko chaaya nahin, fal laage ati dooris dohe ke madhyam se kabir kahana chaahate hai ki sirf bada hone se kuch nahin hota
 Humility is a necessary quality to grow up
 jis prakaar khajur kaa ped itnaa ooncha hone ke baavjood na panthi ko chaaya de saktaa he or na hi uske fal hi aasaani se tode ja sakate hai
 Call it today, do it today, there will be a quarrel in Abal, you will do the work of Kabal today and finish the work today
 aisa na ho ki pralay aa jaae or sab-kuch khatm ho jaae or tum kuch na kar paao
 Speak like this, lose your temper of mind, cool your body, and may you be happy, always speak and speak in such a way that you do not speak to them
 aap khud bhi sukun se rahen or duusare bhi sukhi rahen
 Slowly, mind slowly, slowly everything is watered, water comes, fruits come in the world, all things happen in the world at their own pace, nothing happens with a hurry
 mali puure saal paudhe ko sinchataa he or samay aane par hi fal falte hai
 Say so much, i should not be hungry even in family, the sadhu should not be hungry, where Kabir asks God only that in which the entire family's expenses are spent
 na kam or na zyada
 That they too should not go hungry and none of the sages and saints who came to the door returned hungry
 jaise til main tel he, jyon chakamak main aagtera sai tujh main he, tu jaag sake to jagajis tarah til main tel hone or chakamak main aag hone ke baad dikhalaai nahin padataa
 In the same way God needs to find within himself
 baahar khojane par sirf niraashaa haath lagegi
 Pothi read and read jag mua, pandit bhaya na kohedai akhar prem ke, read so pandit hoekbir says that no one has become knowledgeable in the world by reading books
 balki jo prem ko jaan gaya he vahi duniya kaa sabase bada gyani he
 Worry about such a thing, what should be done, what should be done, where is the medicine thief is the most dangerous, which causes pain in the heart
 is dard kii dawa kisi bhi chikitsak ke paas nahin hoti
 Maya did not die, no body died, Asha, trishna nor dead, saying that Kabir's wishes never die and the heart never fills, only the body ends
 ummid or kisi cheez kii chahat hameshaa jivit rahete hai
 The Question Hour could not be held on Tuesday for the 19th consecutive day due to the huge uproar by the opposition, who were adamant to demand a JPC probe into various scams, including twog spectrum in the winter session of Parliament

 Meira Kumar and Chairman Ansari urged the members to sit in their seats and let the Question Hour run

 Not seeing the commotion, both of them postponed the meeting of their house till twelve o'clock in the afternoon
