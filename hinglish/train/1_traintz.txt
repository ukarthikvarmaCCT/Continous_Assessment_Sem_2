 Bank managers are not able to pay as the line in banks is taking so long

 We are unable to pay in the cash of the workers, and it is difficult to pay the expenses of the household - children's fees
 " The problem of sugarcane farmers is that the sugar mills are not paying the arrears and even the small amount is difficult to get from the banks

 Modi had jumped on the basis of the confidence he had shown before the Lok Sabha elections, and Nitish took a far greater risk by breaking ties with the NDA against making him the bjp's prime ministerial candidate
 jaahir he, jeet kisi ek kii hi honi thi or modi jeet gaye
 Since then, Nitish has been suffering his wounds and is looking forward to the joint Janata Parivar to recover his lost land
 jahaan tak bihar kaa sawaal he, agar aankadon ke sahare sthiti kaa akalan karen to kah sakate hai ki tyaagi kaa ashavad kuch khaas galat nahin he

 If we look at the number of votes polled in the Lok Sabha elections, it is clear that NDA has only 36 in Bihar

 If Lalu and Nitish succeed in Bihar, it will strengthen the Janata Parivar's position in the 2017 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka in 2018
 chautaala ke haryana main 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 After the good performance in Bihar, it may be that Naveen Patnaik's Biju Janata Dal (BJD) and Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress will also join the Janata Parivar
 aisa hone par 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ke liye khatra bada ho jayega
 Omprakash Chautala's options for INLD are also limited

 mulaayam, lalu or chautaala jaise netaaon ne uttar pradesh, bihar or haryana ko 1970 ke dashak se hi hameshaa samaajawaadee raajnneeti ke paramparaagat siyaasi akhaade ke taur par hi dekha he
 Even in the historic elections of 1977 and 1989, when these parties took the Jana Sangh and later the BJP together to defeat the Congress, their hold in these states remained strong
 is tarah bijepi ko madhya pradesh, rajasthan, himachal pradesh or gujarat main apane paanv jamaane kaa mauka de diya
 The grip of these socialist leaders was made possible by the polarization of backward castes with the help of powerful farming communities like Jat, Yadav and Kurmi

 But such experiments have failed many times in the past, so the journey of the Janata Parivar does not look very easy
 vilay ke aupchaarik rup se saakaar hone se bahut pehle hi iske netaaon kii nijee mahatvakankshaayen or ahan sataha par aa gaye
 Mulayam Singh Yadav's cautious stance on SP and the inclusion of Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), once part of the Janata Parivar, shows the role of personal ambitions and ego in the merger process
 vaise janata parivaar ke kuch sadsy nijee baatcheet main sweekaar karte hai ki vilay main hui deree ke peeche sapa he jahaan sirf ek vyakti kii chalati he
 Not everyone within the SP and Mulayam's family is happy with the idea of a merger

 Ram Gopal had instructed Mulayam to keep Ajit Singh away from this whole exercise
 natijatan, mulaayam ke gusse se bachane ke liye sharad yadav, nitish or lalu ko majabuuran chup rahanaa padaa
 Differences have started to emerge from the name of the new party and the election symbol of SP to make the cycle its election symbol
 sapa ke kuch netaaon ne do sambhavit naam sujhaaye hai-samaajawaadee janata party or samaajawaadee janata dal
 By the way, if sources are to be believed, prominent leaders of Janata Parivar have expressed their intention to accept the proposed symbol and name so that Mulayam can be kept happy
 yah alag baat he ki naam or chunaav chihn ko tay karne main chunaav ayog kii sahmati bhi jaruri he
 Another step has been taken to please Mulayam
 nae dal kii nitiyon or samvidhan ko tay karne vaali samiti main ramgopal yadav kaa bhi naam daalaa gaya he
 Ramgopal was missing from the meeting on the day of the announcement of merger

 The truth is that until last month Lalu was not committed to the merger
 sutron kii maane to ve janata parivaar main aane ko tab taiyaar hue jab nitish ne vaada kiya ki bihar main unka kad or bhoomika pehle jaisi hi bani rahegi
 Other members of the erstwhile Janata Dal such as Ram Vilas Paswan (LJP), Ajit Singh (RLD) and Patnaik (BJD) are skeptical about the idea of a merger
 paswan kii algepi jahaan bijepi ke netritv vaale endie kaa hissaa he, vahiin patnayak ne bhi ab tak janata parivaar ko samarthan dene par sahmati jaahir nahin kii he
 Jayant Chaudhary, former RLD Lok Sabha MP, says, “opposition politics are always unstable because people are constantly looking for alternatives
 janata parivaar sahi myne main tabhi parivaar ban paaegaa jab muddon, vichaardhaaraon or netritv par sahmati kaayam hogi
 "A bigger challenge is facing the Janata Parivar in different states than taking minor or neutral parties together
 bihar or usase baahar bijepi se muqabla karne ke liye use is samajhadaari tak aana hoga ki pahchaan kii raajnneeti ke din ab lad gaye hai
 Underlining the real challenge for the old satraps, a Janata Parivar leader says, "in new and emerging India, too much identity politics and communal versus secular discourse will further alienate these leaders
 " ve in netaaon ko puraane jumalon se baahar aane kii chetavanee dete hai
 They also say that aggressive 'yadav' politics will also have to be curbed so that other sections and castes can be taken together in the Hindi belt to counter the saffron wave
 haalanki apane-apane rajyon main mulaayam, lalu or sharad yadavon ke, chautaala jaaton ke, nitish kurmi jati ke or devegoda vokkaliga jati ke pratinidhi hai
 This new group of leaders represents the powerful backward castes in the states where social justice politics emerged as a national option
 isliye in logon ko jati kii aakraamak raajnneeti se ubarna hoga or duusari ati pichhadi jatiyon ke prati zyada samaveshi bananaa hoga
 They have to try to take along
 janata parivaar ke bheetar ke kuch logon ko ummid he ki bihar main nitish kii vikaas-samarthak chhavi or uttar pradesh main yuva akhilesh yadav ke sahare in dalon ke ghatate prabhaav ko dobaaraa hasil karne kii sambhaavna maujuud he
 Tyagi agrees with this idea
 ve maanate hai ki janata parivaar ke netaaon ke saath aane se unhen modi kii lahar ko pachhadgaye kaa ek mauka mila he
 He says, "nitish Kumar and Akhilesh Yadav are likely to form the backbone of this family
 " unka daawa he ki janata parivaar na sirf jaldi main he balki baichaiyn bhi he kyonki use modi style kii raajnneeti ke khatre saaf dikhaai de rahe hai
 Tyagi says, "we are restless to defeat the BJP
 jediu-argedy kii jodi ne agar bihar main bijepi ko haraa diya to yah ek nirnaayak mode hoga
 "however, they also accept that the family needs to make their political discourse more inclusive
 aisa lagata he ki janata parivaar ke pramukh sadasyon ko is baat kaa ehsaas he
 At a press conference held at Mulayam Singh's residence last November, Nitish kept distance from his slogan of social justice
 iske bajaae unhone videsh se kaala dhan laane, rojgaar srijan or kisaanon ko behatar muaavje sambandhi modi ke chunavi vaadon kii hawa nikaalnaa behatar samajha
 The Modi government's amendments to the Land Acquisition Act have provided an opportunity to all these socialist leaders to present themselves as representatives of the agricultural community
 kul milakar nae parivaar ke sadasyon ko apane puraane naaron ko naram karnaa hoga or ek nai tathaa samaveshi siyaasi ranneeti viksit kerani hogi
 This task is not easy but it is also not impossible
 patole ne kaha ki unhone abhi tak yah tay nahin kiya he ki vah kis party main shaamil honge, lekin vah 'kisi samaan vichaardhaara vaale raajnneetik dal' main shaamil hone par vichaar karenge

 kumaar ne agle daur kii baatcheet ke liye hazaare paksh ko patna aamantrit kiya he
 The Chief Minister told reporters after a meeting with Hazare and his companions, 'we had a detailed discussion with the Hazare side about setting up a Lokayukta in the state as well
 ham chaahate hai ki bhrashtachar virdohi nikaay kaa dayera vyapak ho
 The next round of talks with Hazare in this regard will be held in Patna
 ’ baithak main maujuud raheen kiran bedi ne kaha ki nitish kumaar bihar main sabhi str ke adhikariyon sahit mukhyamantri pad ko bhi lokayukta ke daayre main rakhana chaahate hai
 He said that for the first time a Chief Minister has taken such an initiative against corruption
 is par hazaare ne kaha, ‘ham jin muddon ke liye sangharsh kar rahe hai, unase jude kai kadam nitish kumaar pehle hi bihar main uthaa chuke hai
 This is very important for the country
 mukhyamantri bhi sabhi str ke naukarshahon ko swatantra bhrashtachar virdohi nikaay ke daayre main laane ke paksh main hai
 We expect the Lokayukta to be formed in Bihar
 ’hazaare ke saathi kaaryakarta arvind kejariwal ne bhi kaha, ‘nitish kumaar bihar main bhi lokayukta kaa gathan chaahate hai
 He seriously wants to explore the possibility of forming an independent Lokayukta in his state
 nitish ne kaha, ‘hamane bihar main aise kanoon banaaye hai jisase bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii sunwaayee ek varsh main karana or aay se adhik sampatti rakhane waalon kii bhrashtachar se ikattha kii gayi sampatti ko jabt karnaa sunishchit kiya ja sake
 In some cases the property of corrupt people has also been confiscated
 ’ There is now only a few days left to present the general budget
 2019 main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav se pehle pesh kiye ja rahe is bajet se aam logon ko kaaphi ummide hai
 It also includes the expectation of home purchase discount
 awaas evam shahari vikaas mantralay ne bhi 'sabake liye ghar' yojana ko murtarup dene ke liye 20 hajaar karod rupee ke bajet aavanton kii maang kii he
 However, to fulfill this dream, some important steps in the budget are necessary
 aadhaar houseing finance limited ke managing diarector or siio deu shankar treepathi kaa kahana he ki agar sarkaar sabko ghar kii yojana ko moort rup dena chaahati he, to use is bajet main aam aadmi ko saste ghar dene kii ghoshnaaon ke saath hi real estate sector kii haalat sudhaarney par bhi dhyaan dena hoga
 According to the need of housing revolution, according to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to make the house plan for everyone, like the Green Revolution, the housing revolution (housing revolution) is needed
 sarkaar nepradhanmantri awaas yojanajise kai faislon se isaki shuruyaat to kar di he, lekin is bajet main ise aage badhaane ke liye kuch ahm ghoshnaaen sarkaar ko kerani chahie
 According to Tripathi, these changes can happen on 5 fronts
 real estate sector ko karnaa hoga majbutanotbandi, rera or jiesti kaa real estate par kaaphi zyada asar padaa he
 In such a situation, the government will have to focus on strengthening this sector
 bildersasste ghar banane ke liye prerit ho saken, iske liye unhen kam acre kii jameen kharidne ke liye lone kii suvidha milani chahie
 At present, they do not get a loan to buy small land
 aisi jameen kharidne ke liye kam se kam 40 se 50 fisadi lone kii suvidha kii jaani chahie
 Need for quick approval
 Whenever a builder wants to work on a cheap home project, the Center as well as the state government should provide speedy approval for such schemes
 sarkaar ko chahie ki vah is bajet main real estate pariyojnaon ke twarit apruval kaa intjaam kare
 So that houses can be constructed on time and the supply can improve
 home lone par tex chhot badhesabko ghar dene kii yojana tab hi saakaar ho sakegi, jab unke liye ghar khareednaa aasaan banaaya jayega
 For this, the government should increase the tax exemption for home loans in the budget
 ummid he ki sarkaar is bajet main maujuuda 2
 The discount of Rs 5 lakh will be Rs 3 lakh
 isse zyada log tex chhot kaa phayda uthaa paaenge
 There is also a need to improve stamp duty
 desh main har rajya ke stamp duty ko lekar apane niyam hai
 The government needs it to do one country one tax and one stamp duty
 ise jiesti ke tahat laakar duty ko puure desh main ek samaan kar diya janaa chahie
 So that the common people can get some relief from the burden of stamp duty
 is morche par raahat milane kaa matlab he ki aam aadmi kaa ghar kharidne par hone vaala kaaphi zyada paisa bachegaa
 Stamp duty on small loans up to Rs 15 lakh should be reduced to one per cent
 awaas kranti kaa rasta karnaa hoga taiyarvitt mantri arun jetali ko real estate sector kii haalat sudhaarney par focus karne ke saath hi is sector main rojgaar kii sthiti sudhaarney par bhi dhyaan dena hoga
 Currently, lack of employment is a major challenge in the country
 sarkaar ne pradhanmantri awaas yojana or aam logon ko saste ghar dilaane ke liye kai badi ghoshnaaen ateet main kii hai
 What is needed now is to implement them properly and prepare the way for this and the beginning of the housing revolution is legitimized to realize the plan to give everyone a home

 Earlier there was speculation that Priyanka might return to Bollywood with Kalpana Chawla or Rakesh Sharma biopic

 Salman gets permission to go abroad, because of this, why was Priyanka's comeback with Salman? log salmaan kii filmon kaa intjaar karte hai
 His previous film 'tiger Zinda Hai' did a business of 300 crores at the box office
 tubalite ko chhod den to salmaan kii pichhali kai filmein block baster sabit hui hai
 It is expected that 'bharat' will do the same business as Salman's previous film
 salmaan ke baraabar priyanka kaa rolefilm ke nirdeshak ali abbaas jafar ne bataaya ki priyanka chopra kaa kairactor 'bharat' kii aatma he

 According to the police, this man named Abul Hasan did not like his daughter, so he tried to bury her in the back of the house
 usne bacchee ke haath baandhe, munh par kapadaa baandha or ghar ke peeche gaddha khodakar dafnane laga
 During this time, when his wife reached home, he placed a wooden drum above the daughter buried at the waist so that it would not be visible and he would later complete the rest
 lekin, bacchee kii maa ko jab vah dikhaai nahin di tab use shaq hua or usne khojbin kii tab vah aadhi dafan haalat main use mili
 With the help of neighbors, the accused father has been arrested by the police

 India is a seaside country but for centuries we have been ignoring the sea and only looking at the land
 isaki vajah yah he ki hamalavar hajaaron varshon se bharat par jamini raste se hi hamalaa karte rahe hai
 Even today, India's unresolved borders with its three neighbors are consuming national security resources and remain a matter of concern
 lekin raashtra kii samruddhi kii kunjee 7,600 kimi lanbaa samudratat he
 There are 13 large and 183 small ports in India which are called sea ports

 Without them, India's economic miracle would not have happened
 bharat duniya kaa teesraa sabase bada matsay utpaadak desh he
 There are more than three lakh fishing boats
 is tarah, samudri vaanijya, samudri suraksha or rashtriya suraksha ke bich atoot sambandh he
 The terrorists used this relationship as a destroyer on 26 November
 unhone chori kii ek machhliimaar nauka se bharat kii aarthik rajdhani main ghus kar maut kaa nanga naach nacha
 This is the worst example of economic terrorism

 The concept of Marine Police came to light after the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts
 un dhamaakon ke liye visphotakon kii taskari samudr ke jariye kii gai thi
 But the concept of Marine Police did not work because the officials of the nine coastal states did not want to invest resources in coastal policing
 vah bhi jab samudr se khatre badhate ja rahe hai
 Therefore, the need now is for Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) or maritime awareness
 neshnal meritime adwiser or suniyojit tateey kaman ke paas is tarah kii koi vyavastha honi chahie taaki samudri maamalon se sambandhit kam-se-kam aath vibhinn mantralayon ke bich kargar saamanjasy bithaaya ja sake
 Fishing vessels need to be upgraded with an automatic identification system, which works up to 100 nautical miles, and a long range identification and tracker system that works up to 700 nautical miles
 iske saath-saath, tatarakshakon kii shakti ko chaar guna or karmiyon kii sankhya doguna badhanaa hoga
 The Coast Guard has only 74 vessels, 44 aircraft and 8,000 personnel to monitor India's navigable range from 12 nautical miles to 200 nautical miles
 nausena se har saal sevanivrutt hone vaale 5,000 anbhavi navikon main se zyaadaatar ko rajya marine police ikaayiyon main niyukt karne par vichaar karnaa chahie
 The ground boundaries also remain equally vulnerable
 pakistan ke saath bharat kii 3,323 kimi lambii seemaa lagi hui he
 This includes the controversial Line of Control
 kul 2,308 kimi seemaa par baad lagaai jaani thi
 But about 1,900 km border fencing has been completed and only 1,800 km of illumination is in place
 bangladesh se bharat kii 4,000 kimi seemaa lagi hui he jisamen se keval 2,500 kimi par baad lagi he
 Hence Bangladesh infiltrates into India
 vot bank kii raajnneeti or netaa-apradhi santhganth ke kaaran simaaon ke kuch hisson par kabhi baad nahin lagaai jaati yaa gramin jiro line se peeche kabhi nahin jate
 India has a 1,751 km border with Nepal and 1,643 km with Myanmar
 ye simaaen abhi bhi khuli hui hai jahaan se ghuspaith or banduukon kii taskari hoti he
 The Border Security Force has 157 battalions to monitor the entire western and eastern border, which is more than 7,000 km long
 uskaa kahana he ki uske paas karmiyon kaa abhaav he
 It immediately needs 69 more battalions or at least 69,000 more personnel
 bhedya samudratat se desh ke aantarik bhaag kii taraf badhen to bharat kii avasanrachana main oochaal dikhegi
 But this infrastructure can be called its weak aspect because it never invests in security
 naagarik uddyan sector ko chhod duusari koi bhi sarkari agency privet bijli pariyojnaon, shopping malls, multiplexes, ity parkon or paanch sitara hotalon kaa suraksha moolyankan nahin karti
 After 9 / 11, the United States Ministry of Internal Security has made non-basic infrastructure protection a shared responsibility of federal, state, and local government
 isamen nijee kshetra kii sakriy saajhedaari he
 In India this gap must be bridged immediately
 masalan, kendriya audyogic suraksha bal centre sarkaar kii zyaadaatar kendriya avasanrachana kii rakhwali karata he jisamen hawaondde or bijli sanyantr shaamil hai
 It has about one lakh personnel but 20,000 more personnel are needed to protect vital installations
 sarkaar ko chahie ki vah siif ko privet sector kii avasanrachana sambandhi badi pariyojnaon kii khaamiyon ke vyapak akalan or pariyojnaon kii avadharana ke samay se hi usamen suraksha jodne kaa adhikaar de de
 Devices like surveillance cameras, electronic perimeter and motion detectors can be used to reduce the need for more personnel-demanding security
 ye morganirdesh bhavi hamalon ko rokane main kaaphi kargar sabit ho sakate hai
 Action plan should be fenced on priority basis
 seemasuraksha badhaane or sarkari tathaa nijee avasanrachana pariyojnaon kii suraksha ke liye siif or biguef main karmiyon kii sankhya badhaai jaani chahie
 Identification and protection of large important establishments should be done
 karmiyon kii sankhya ghataane ke liye technology kaa istemaal kiya janaa chahie
 Safety engineering should be made mandatory before approving projects

 "all wars eventually end, but the power and the power they gain is always there
" ''—frank chodorovbharat kii sheersh jaanch agency (sibiai) kii chhichhaledar ko dekh rahaa 71 saal kaa bhartiya loktantr apane astitv kii sabase badi duvidha se mukaabil he
 This dilemma has been following us since the last century whether we want powerful democratic institutions or powerful governments? Both are unable to walk together
 yadi ham taqatvar yani bahumat se las sarkarein chunate hai to ve loktantr kii sansthaaon kii takatchin leti hai
 In the pre-1991 history of Indian democracy, all the memories of powerful governments (indira-rajiv Gandhi) which we have in majority, include the bad days of democratic institutions i
e
 courts, expression, investigative agencies, regulators
 1991 ke baad bahumat kii pehali sarkaar hamen mili to usamen bhi loktantr kii sansthaaon kii swalayattata or nirpekshata suuli par tangi he
 This government also has the same old design of suffocating democracy
 taqatvar sarkaar yah nahin samaj paati ki vah swayan bhi loktantr kii sanstha he or vah anya sansthaaon kii takat chhinakar kabhi sweekaarya or safal nahin ho sakati
 Is the CBI the only victim of this habit of showing strength? The government's tenure is nearing its end but despite the scandal of the Supreme Court, the Lokpal could not be made
 paardarshita to badhaane vaale vicellabloar kanoon ne sansad kaa munh nahin dekha lekin soochna ke adhikaar ko simit karne kaa prastaav sansad tak aa gaya
 The government showed its strength to the Supreme Court regarding the appointment of judges and democracy was tolerated
 rigerv bank kii swaittata main dakhal hua to puri duniya ke vittiya bazaaron main thu-thu hui
 The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has clawed at the freedom of news on the pretext of preventing false news
 virodh hua or pradhanmantri ne bhul sudhaar kiya
 It is important to remember that in the last four years, a government chanting the Minimum Government did not create a single independent regulator in India, in contrast, the freedom of institutions like UGC, CAG (GSTN Audit ban) was reduced
 chunaav ayog kaa rajnatik istemaal taqatvar sarkaar ke khatre kii nai numaaish he
 The Supreme Court had to say that what was the need of using the money bill in Lok Sabha to get the Aadhar Act passed? The arrogance of power spread to the states
 rajasthan sarkaar chaahati thi ki afasaron or nyaayadhishon par khabar likhane se pehle usase poocha jaae
 This attempt to change the foundation of democracy was ultimately a farm
 madhya pradesh sarkaar ne vidhansabha main sawaal poochne ke adhikaar simit karne kaa prastaav rakh diya
 Honorable were unfazed, the reporters raised questions and the sedan had to be returned
 yah katai jaruri nahin he ki loktantr main sarkaar kaa har faisla sahi sabit ho
 History is replete with failure of government policies
 lekin loktantr main faisle lene kaa tarika sahi hona chahie
 Most of the troubles of powerful governments arise from their undemocratic methods
 notebandi, rafel, jiesti, aadhaar jaise faisle sarkaar ke gale main isliye fanse hai kyonki jimmedaar sansthaaon kii andekhi kii gai
 When courts are moving beyond collective freedoms to individual liberties (privacy, relations, gender differences), then the autonomy of democratic institutions is worth seeing
 kya 1991 ke baad kaa samay bharat ke liye zyada behatar tha jab sarkaron ne khud ko simit kiya or desh ko nai niamak sansthaaen milin?kya bhartiya loktantr alpamat sarkaron ke haath main zyada surakshit he?kya kamjor sarkarein behatar hai jinke tain loktantr kii sansthaaen taqatvar rah sakati hai?ham sirf vot de sakate hai
 We cannot decide what democracy the governments will give us, so while voting, we should remember the words of author Alan Moore that governments should fear the public and not the public
 bhartiya loktantr apane astitv kii sabase badi duvidha se mukaabil he*** Asaduddin Owaisi's hopes of trying to find political land in UP have come as a shock
 15 march ko elahabaad main hone vaali raily ke liye prashasan ne apni di hui manjuuri ko cancil kar diya he
 The administration has revoked the approval citing local protests and board exams
 gauratlab he ki 4 march ko prashasan ne is raily kii manjuuri de di thi
 The rally was to address the President of the All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), Asaduddin Owaisi
 owesi upi main 2017 main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav ko dhyaan main rakhte hue abhi se upi main apni siyaasi paith banane main lage hue hai
 After the approval of the rally was canceled, aimim's state convenor Alika said that the way the approval is first approved and subsequently canceled, it is clear that the Samajwadi Party is nervous about AIMIM coming to UP
 yah pehla mauka nahin he, jab ovaisi ko upi main raily karne se roka gaya he
 Even before this, the Owaisi rally was not approved by the administration four times
 elahabaad main ijaajat waapas liye jane ke baad ab 29 march ko agra main prastaavit kaarykram par bhi khatre ke badal mandaraane lage hai
 The Lok Sabha elections are due in 2014 and keeping this in mind, the poll survey of a private TV channel shows the bjp-led NDA gaining a significant edge over the Congress-led UPA
 times nau, si voter or india tivi ke rashtriya chunaav surveykshan main kaha gaya he ki koi bhi ek party apane dam par sarkaar banane kii sthiti main nahin hogi or unhen satta main aane ke liye sahyogiyon kii jarurat hogi
 However, the survey said that the key to power at the center would be in the hands of Samajwadi Party's Mulayam Singh Yadav, aiadmk's Jayalalithaa, Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee and BSP leader Mayawati
 surveykshan ke anusaar, kisi bhi dal ke netritv main sarkaar ke gathan main in dalon kii bhoomika mahatvapurn hogi
 The survey projected that the NDA could emerge as the largest coalition with 156 seats
 bijepi 131 siton ke saath sabase badi party ban kar ubharegi jabaki shivasena ko 15 seat, akali dal ko 7 seat, arpiai (athavle) ko do seat or neshnal pipuls party ko ek seat milegi
 The survey said that UPA would get 136 seats
 isamen congress ko 119 seat, ensipi ko 6 seat, areldi ko 3 seat, jeemem ko 3 seat, iuemail ko 2 seat, neshnal conference ko 2 seat or kerala congress ko ek seat milengi
 According to the poll survey, 'it will be the lowest number of seats received by both the major political parties in the country so far
 ’ aisa anumaan vyakt kiya ja rahaa he ki congress yaa bijepi ke baahar se samarthan se vaikalpik morche kii sarkaar ban sakati he
 The survey said that the third or fourth front under the leadership of SP or AIADMK can emerge as the largest non-congress, non-bjp coalition and reach magical figures with the support of one of the largest political parties
 bharat ke agle pradhanmantri ke ahm sawaal par surveykshan main kaha gaya he ki 37
 7 percent people are in favor of Narendra Modi
 rahul gandhi 17
 Second place with 6 percent, 6
 2 pratishat ke saath manmohan singh tisare sthaan par or 3
 Sonia Gandhi finished fourth with 9 percent

 Bahujan Samaj Party leader Satish Mishra attacked Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi and said that he was studying abroad, he was a foreign friend
 vah keval vot maangane yahaan aate he
 Addressing a public meeting held in Yashodnagar of Maharajpur assembly constituency in favor of Bahujan Samaj Party candidates, Mishra targeted Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi and the scams in the Congress government and raised both in the dock
 unhone kaha ki congress kii sarkaar main ghotaalon ke alaava kuch bhi nahin hua
 Two g scam, Commonwealth scam, Aircraft procurement scam, in which the government lost thousands of crores of rupees and the Congress leaders accuse the state government of scam
 unki sarkaar main to ghotalebaajon ko turant sarkaar se baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya
 Taking a dig at Rahul Gandhi, he said that he says that those who go to work in other states from Uttar Pradesh are beggars, whereas Rahul himself has no house in Uttar Pradesh
 unki shiksha diksha sab videsh main hui he, unki parvarish videsh main hui he, unke dost videshi he, vah to bas chunaav ladane or vot maangane hi uttar pradesh main aate he
 
 
 Now you tell me who became a beggar

 sahitya aaj tak ke manch par dow ushakiran khan or liladhar jagudi ne 'lok sangeet or sahitya' vishay par charchaa kii
 He told how the popularity of folk songs is decreasing and what the real meaning of folk is
 
 
 is dauraan dow ushakiran khan ne kaha ki loksangit yaa lok sahitya sirf sangeet hi nahin he, balki sangeet ke saath kathaayen hai
 The way he used to preach his sorrow and pain is the beginning of folk music or literature
 wo lok sangeet striyon kii manobhaavna he or yah lipibaddh sahitya se pehle kii baat he
 At the age of 26, the role of the 70-year-old was depressed by the character Annu Kapoor, while Liladhar Jagudi said, 'lok is not an English folk
 angreji kaa foch shabd gramin anchal se jude hone ke liye kaha jaataa he
 Although the expansion of folk is very much, as many folk are talked about earlier
 unhone bataaya ki koi shabd aisa nahin, jisamen sangeet nahin he or shabd main jo sangeet hota he, usamen ham bhul gaye hai
 The music emanating from the word is different and the music extracted from the instruments is different
 'liladhar jagudi ne yah bhi kaha, 'agar dekha jaae to kavita kaa janm bhi katha kehane ke liye kiya gaya he
 All the measures have been devised to tell the story and the story cannot be called only fiction
 vahiin ushakiran ne bataaya, 'zyaadaatar prem ke geet pashu-pakshiyon main purush gaata he or ek purush jaanavar hi maadaa jaanavar ko aakarshith karne ke liye gaata he
 Only in the male race does the female sing songs for males
 vahiin gaathaayen purushon ne rachit kiya he
 These stories were also told through pictures and this is the basis of connecting with the folk
 'sahitya ajtak: 'wo bhagava-haraa chillaayenge, tum tirange par ade rahanaa'liladhar jagudi ne kaha ki filmi geet lok geeton ke aadhaar par rache gaye hai
 However now folk songs seem to have disappeared and now villagers are making folk songs to film tunes
 yah kai kaarnon se ho rahaa he
 He also said that literature is not only concerned with humans but also for other beings
 saath hi unhone bataaya ki sundar shabd sunar shabd se bana he
 At the same time, the word charu was used for beauty and those who say good things were called charuvak
 liladhar jagudi ne kaha ki sahitya kaa sarokaar sirf manushyon se hi nahin balki anya praaniyon ke liye bhi he
 He said that the songs are constantly changing and will change further
 vahiin ushakiran ne kaha ki jab aise kaarykram hote rahe, to logon ko yah dekhakar lagegaa ki lok geeton par bahes ho rahi he to hamen iske bare main sochna chahie
 Actually people no longer sing folklore to show modernity

 In the last seven Lok Sabha elections, the regional parties, including the Left parties, got 160 to 210 seats and six times the government could not be formed at the Center without their support

 Former Pakistan captain Mohammad Yusuf said that if the International Cricket Council's current rules related to chucking were implemented earlier, the legendary Sri Lankan player and the most Test wicket-taker in the world, Muttiah Muralitharan, would never have been allowed to play international cricket
 yusuf ne jeeyo news channel se kaha, ‘murali apni kohni ko 15 degree kii maujuuda seemaa se kahin adhik modate the lekin vah bhaagyashaalee rahe ki sheersh str par cricket khel paae kyonki us samay isisi ke niyam alag the
 He said, 'I played against him many times and i know how he used to go beyond the 15 degree limit
 prayek gend ke saath aap dekh sakate the ki uski gend kii gati bad jaati thi or main swayan se kahata tha ‘tum bhaagyashaalee ho jo khel rahe ho
 "under the old rules, bowlers like Murali who bended elbows above 15 degrees were allowed to play on medical grounds but now things have changed and i support these changes," Yusuf said
 ’(input bhashaa se) After adding the repo rate to the interest rate, it will directly benefit the customers
now when the RBI cuts the repo rate, the bank will also have to cut the interest rate
 10 fisadi kii katautee kar chukaa hailgaataar apil ke baad ab bhartiya rigerv bank (RBI) ne bainkon ko sabhi lone repo rate se jodne kaa nirdesh diya he
 RBI has asked all banks to add home loans, auto loans, personal loans and all types of loans in MSME sector with repo rate from 1 October
 RBI kaa sakht faisladansal pichley kuch maheenon se kendriya bank lagaataar sabhi sarkari or privet bainko se repo rate ke saath bank lone ko jodne ke liye kah rahaa tha
 But many banks were ignoring the rbi's appeal
 jiske baad ab kendriya bank ko dedline ke saath nirdesh dena padaa he
 Apart from this, RBI has asked to change the interest rates at least once in 3 months under external benchmarks like repo
 bank kar rahe the manamanigrahakon kii lagaataar shikaayat rahi he ki kendriya bank dwaara repo rate main katautee ke baavjood bank byaaj dar kam nahin kar rahe hai
 The Reserve Bank was also angry about this
 bataa den, rigerv bank 2019 main chaar baar repo rate main kul milakar 1
 Has cut 10 percent
 is vitt varsh main april ke baad se ab tak kendriya bank 0
 Has cut up to 85 percent
 RBI ke nirdesh se graahakon ko phaaydarepo rate ko byaaj dar se linking kii vyavastha lagu hone kaa sidhaa phayda graahakon ko milegaa
 Because from now on, whenever the Reserve Bank will cut the repo rate, then it will be mandatory for banks to cut the interest rate
 iskaa asar yah hoga ki aapaki auto lone or home lone samet anya lone kii iemai dar main kami aegi
 Not only this, the system will become more transparent than before, after the system of linking loan to repo rate is implemented
 isse har karj lene vaale vyakti ko byaaj dar ke bare main pataa hoga
 They will also know what profit the banks are taking
 iske alaava graahak bainkon ke lone kii byaaj daron kii bhi tulana kar sakenge
 Public sector banks had agreed that in the past, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had appealed to all banks to link interest rates to repo rates
 lekin arabiai governor kii apil ke baad bhi kuchhek bainkon ne hi is par amal kiya
 The important thing is that those who have decided to add interest rates to the repo rate are all public sector banks
 arabiai governor kii salaah maanane waalon main sabase pehla bank bhartiya state bank (SBI) tha
 On the lines of SBI, the public sector Bank of Baroda and Union Bank also decided to link the loan to the repo rate
 lekin kuch privet bank isko lekar gambhir nahin dikh rahe the
 What is the situation? At present, different loan interest rates are based on an internal benchmark such as the benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) and the marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR)
 is benchmark par bhi bainkon kii byaaj daren repo rate par hi aadhaarit hoti hai
 But this is not a mandatory process
 kehane kaa matlab yah he ki maujuuda sthiti main arabiai ke repo rate katautee ke baad bhi bainkon par byaaj dar kam karne kaa koi dabaav nahin hota he
 According to him, he cuts the interest rates
 bataa den ki repo rate vah dar hoti he jis par bainkon ko arabiai karj detaa he
 Banks provide loans to customers on this basis
 repo rate kam hone se bainkon ko raahat milti he
 After this, banks can extend the loan to the customers at a low interest rate

 shabnam khan isi sab se guzar rahi hai
 Shabnam is a South African writer and artist living in the city of Durban
 lekin shabnam ko chah saal pehle jindagi kaa sabase bada jhatka laga jab canada main rahane vaale unke ek dost ne unki ek tasviir ko fasebuk wal par aplod kii
 The friend had taken this picture from an advertisement published in a local newspaper promoting immigration
 shabnam ko tabhi se ajab ajab anubhav ho rahe hai
 Shabnam shared these experiences on Twitter
 shabnam hairaan thim ki canada main sthaneey akhbaar ke liye imigration ko pramot karne vaale vigyaapan main unki tasviir kaise aa gai? is par unki ek dost ne yaad dilaayaa ki bahut saal pehle uniwarsity main padhane ke dauraan unhone ek free photoshute main hissaa liya tha
 Shabnam then inadvertently allowed the photographer to use his photos commercially as a stock photo in exchange for making his portrait
 shabnam us vakt kii apni naadaani ko lekar ab pachhataati hai
 When Shabnam approached the photographer, he confirmed that his photo had been used as a stock photo for many advertisers as he had signed such a deal
 hairaan pareshaan shabnam ne reverse search tuls ke jariye apni tasveeron ko search karnaa shuru kiya
 Shabnam was surprised to see that her photographs have been used all over the world
 vigyapandaata america se china tak, cambodia se canada, urugve se bharat, france se dakshin korea sabhi jagah tarah tarah ke utpaadon ke liye shabnam kii tasveeron kaa istemaal karte rahe
 Shabnam found that his face continued to appear in advertisements to sell everything from carpets to aging creams
 yaheen nahin canada or urugve main imigration ko pramot karnaa, cambodia main trekking ke liye hidaayaten dena, ajukeshan cites par bacchon ko padhaanaa or french dating cites par saathi kii talash karnaa, har jagah unki tasviren maujuud raheen
 Shabnam found that many advertisers unethically used their identity, ethnicity and name by changing them
 photographer ne shabnam ke puche jane par bataaya ki usne jis deal par dastakhat kiye the usamen pahchaan se chhedchhad or jhuthe naam istemaal karne kaa adhikaar bhi diya tha
 Despite using Shabnam's photographs in advertisements across the world, he did not gain a single penny
 shabnam ko aarthik taur par koi malaal nahin lekin vigyapandaataaon kii beyimaani or aniatikta ne bahut aahat kiya
 Recently, Shabnam phoned the photographer and threatened legal action
 is par photographer ne kaha sab kuch kanoonee tareeke se kiya gaya tha or unhensaari sharton ke bare main bataadia gaya tha
 Although the photographer agreed to remove all the advertisements from his site, many of his customers have bought these photos and the pictures of Shabnam continue to pop up from his advertisements
 abhi tak shabnam is sab ko halke main leti rahi thim
 Many people used to say to Shabnam that if she saw her face in advertisements, then she would just keep smiling
 lekin ab shabnam ne sthiti kii gambhirtha ko samajha ki kaise log apane swaarth or laabh ke liye unki tasveeron ke saath chhedchhad kar sakate hai
 In such a situation, in order to warn others, Shabnam decided to share the tragedy on social media
 shabnam kaa kahana he ki jane-anjaane main aisi kisi bhi deal ko lekar sab sajag rahen or sab kuch acchhee tarah jaanane ke baad hi koi faisla len
 Shabnam now realizes how heavy a photo shoot done at a young age would be when she was a student
 tab photoshute kii utsukata or jaldbaaji main form par dastakhat karne se pehle us par likhi sharton ko thik se naa padhane kaa shabnam ko ab baari afsos he
 Shabnam had signed a deal that gave the whole world the right to misuse her picture and identity for her own selfishness

 National Minorities Commission (NCM) chairman Gayurul Hasan Rizvi on Sunday said that filing a review petition against the Supreme Court's verdict on Ayodhya would not be in the interest of Muslims and would "harm" the unity between the two communities
 alpsankhyak ayog ke pramukh ne kaha ki punarvichaar yachika daayar karne se hinduon ke bich aisa sandesh jayega ki ve ram mandir ke nirmaan ke raste main rode atka rahe hai
 He also requested the Muslim side to accept the five-acre alternative land given for the mosque
 unhone kaha ki aisa karnaa nyaaypalika kaa sammaan hoga
 Rizvi said that the NCM held a meeting following the order of the Supreme Court and all its members had said in unison that the verdict should be accepted
 ensiem adhyaksh ne kaha ki muslimon ko ayodhya main mandir banane main madad kerani chahie jabaki hinduon ko masjid ke nirmaan main madad kerani chahie
 He said that it would prove to be a milestone in strengthening the social harmony between the two communities
 rizvi ke anusaar, punarvichaar yachika daayar karne se hinduon ke bich yah sandesh jayega ki muslim samudaay ayodhya main ram mandir ke nirmaan kii raah main rode atkana chahta he
 He said that this would "harm" hindu-muslim unity
 unhone kaha, ''punarvichaar yachika daayar nahin kerani chahie kyonki ol india muslim personal lau board (empielbi) or jamiyat ulema-e-hind samet sabhi pakshon ne vaada kiya tha ki ucchtam nyaayalay dwaara die gaye faisle kaa sammaan kiya jayega''
 He alleged that Muslim organizations like AIMPLB and Jamiat are backing their promises
 rizvi ne poocha, ''sirf abhi nahin balki kai varshon se ve kah rahe hai ki ve ucchtam nyaayalay ke faisle ko sweekaar karenge to phir punarvichaar kii kya jarurat he?'' unhone poocha ki punarvichaar yachika daayar karne kaa kya auchity he jab ve bhi kah rahe hai ki yachika ''100 fisadi'' khaarij kar di jaaegi
 The NCM chief said, "the common Muslim reconsideration of this country is not in favor of the petition as it does not want the cases that have been resolved to be taken up again and the community stuck in such things"
 rizvi ne kaha ki ol india majalis-e-ittehad-ul-muslimin (eimm) pramukh asaduddin ovaisi samet empielbi ke sirf chaar-paanch sadsy hi punarvichaar yachika ke paksh main hai
 The NCM chief alleged that Owaisi used politics using Muslims and he "wants to keep them entangled in such issues so that they can get votes"

 Then said that i can become the spokesperson of his organization
 phir ek sevak ko bulaakar kaha ki vah mere mata-pita ko jane ke liye kah de, kyonki ab vah anushthan shuru karne vaale hai

 This amounts to 54 percent of the total coins prevalent in the market

 05 Setting up a call center in Karnataka is not a new thing, but if someone says that a political party has set up a call center in the state to know the situation on the ground during elections, then it is definitely compelling
 Does
 darasal, congress ne karnataka vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan 65,000 boothon par sthiti kii nigaraanee ke liye do kol centre sthapit kiye hai
 The Congress has set up these two call centers in Bangalore and Mysore to keep in touch with booth level party workers for 24 hours
 yah pehali baar he, jab apane nae adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke netritv main party ne apane kaaryakartaaon, pratinidhiyon, booth kaaryakartaaon or jila netaaon se niyamit rup se sampark main rahane ke liye kol centre sthapit kiye hai
 Speaking to India Today, Dinesh Gundu Rao, acting president of the Karnataka Congress, said, 'we have set up these call centers for better arrangements in each constituency
 iske madhyam se ham apane kaaryakartaaon ke saath sidhe taur par sampark main rahenge
 Get direct and real feedback, especially at the booth level
 'congress ke 100 sadsy har kol centre par maujuud rahenge
 These members will keep in touch with party booth workers, booth representatives and other workers and keep an eye on the situation in every region
 donon kol centres se milane vaali jaankaree or aankaden party ko apane abhiyaan ke saath-saath booth prabandhan ko lekar ranneeti banane main madad karenge
 People in the research department of the party under the leadership of Prof
 Rajeev Gowda will analyze these data
 iske baad ise party ummidavaaron ke saath saajha kiya jaayegaa, jisase wo apane prachaar abhiyaan main badlaav kar saken
 At the same time, these data and information will be analyzed, which will also help the party in making further strategies
 dilachasp baat yah he ki agar booth str par koi samasya utpann hoti he to kol centre adhikari booth prabharee, pratinidhiyon or karmchaariyon ko suzav denge, taaki samasya kaa nidaan ho sake
 Gundu Rao said, 'there will be a two-way flow of information through call centers
 isse hamen booth str kii sabhi jaankaree praapt hogi or ham apane karmchaariyon ko bhi apni baat kah sakenge
 Also, if there is a problem for our employees, then it can also be solved
 congress ne gujarat se sikhaaam taur par, abhi tak chunaav ke dauraan booth vyavasthit karne main vifal hone ke karancongressko aalochana kaa shikaar hona padaa he
 Ineffective management at the booth level was a major reason for the party's loss in the Gujarat assembly elections
 gujarat se sikhte hue congress ne ek majboot booth abhiyaan ke madhyam se, karnataka vidhansabha chunaav main lagbhag 8 se 9 lakh booth str ke kaaryakartaaon kii sena taiyaar kii he
 The battle to dominate Darul Uloom may have been defeated by Gujarat reformist academician Maulana Ghulam Muhammad Vastanvi at the moment, but the hope of his return to this biggest center of Deobandi masalak is not completely lost
 jang kaa yah doosraa charan tha
 The fight is expected to last several phases
 23-24 july ko majalise-shura kii baithak main baaji palat gai
 In its meeting of last January 10, a large part of the support Vastanvi could muster to reach the post of Mohatamim got from the opponents
 siyasat or siyasatdanon kii kathani or kerani donon main fark saaf dikh rahaa tha
 Then supporters of Maulana Mahmud Madni, the leader of one faction of Jamiat ulama-e-hind, stood behind Vastanvi, but this time these three members joined five members of Maulana Arshad Madni, leader of the other faction of Jamiat
 kisi ke prati siyaasi nishtha na rakhane vaale ek sadsy ne jab bahumat ko vastanvi ke khilaaf dekha to ve bhi matdaan main palat gaye
 In majlisse-shura, nine members supported Vastanvi's demand for resignation, while five members including Vastanavi himself opposed it
 inamen assam se eudief ke netaa or saansad tathaa mumbai main itr ke bade vyavsaayee moulana badaruddin ajmal bhi shaamil hai
 Three members did not attend the meeting
 21 sadasyeey majalise shura main chaar sthaan abhi khaali hai
 Vastanvi accepted this decision as Allah's will and described his defeat as the result of a conspiracy- (see conversation)
 daarul ulum main halaat is kadar najuk kabhi nahin the
 Such apprehensions about this institution did not arise even after the demise of Jamiat national president Maulana Asad Madani on February 6, 2006, when a fight started within the Madani family to decide his authority
 mudda yah tha ki jamiyat par pehla haq unke bete mahmud kaa hoga yaa unke bhai arshad kaa
 Maulana Marguburrahman was also in a dilemma regarding this question, who held the Mohammatim status of Darul Uloom for 28 years and was also a family well-wisher of Maulana Assad
 vyaktigat taur par unhen lagata tha ki bada hone ke kaaran yah jimmedaari arshad ko mili or vakt aane par mahmud aage aa jaaen, par mana jaataa he ki mahmud apana haq chhodane ko taiyaar nahin the
 Marguburrahman sweated a lot to maintain relationships and find a common solution, but could not succeed
 is sthiti se ve pichley saal 8 disambar ko apane nidhan tak bhi nahin ubar sake
 He was convinced that the social and religious organization established by the Deobandi Muslims in 1919 was torn apart in front of him
 arshad or mahmud donon ke bich apni jamiyat ko asli bataane or use banaae rakhane kii khuli jang shuru ho gai, jo abhi jari he
 Marguburrahman tried his best to keep himself neutral, but Mahmud kept him standing in his court, causing Arshad to be hurt inside
 maraguburrahaman ke nidhan ke baad arshad samarthak ashankit ho uthe ki daarul ulum ke mohatamim pad ke chayan main kahin yah khandaan apni bhoomika hi na ganvaa den
 To take a month's time for this, a faction of majlisse-shura temporarily nominated the immediate Mahmud camp's Mufti Abul Qasim Naumani as caretaker Mohtamim, which led to the rise of the Arshad camp
 unke gut kii sari koshishen naumani ko hataane main lag gayi
 The wishes of Arshad Saheb's supporters to make him beautiful, started to shake
 par iske ulat ek tisare kheme ne yahaan nayaa pintara chalaa
 Member of Parliament Maulana Ajmal succeeded in crowning Vastanvi, who is with Arshad
 arshad kheme ke liye raahat kii baat yahi thi ki ve unki ankhon main khatak rahe mahmud kheme ke naumani ko hataane main safal rahe
 In his hankering, the supporters presented Arshad's name in protest against Vastanvi
 magar naumani ko hataane se aahat mahmud kheme ke shura sadsy vastanvi ke saath kham thokkar khadey ho gaye, jisase vastanvi ne arshad ko aasaani se haraa diya
 Due to these devious tricks of politics, the war had to continue
 par vastanvi ko arshad khemaa sahan nahin kar paaya
 Arshad, who drank the defeat, strategically silenced himself and hinted that the supporters would continue the war
 is puure prakaran main nirnaayak mode tab aayaa jab thake-haare chachaa ko bhattije mahmud kii madad shiddat se mahasoos hui
 The clever and keen political player Mahmud was probably waiting for this moment
 ve vastanvi ke khilaaf charchaa ko khamosh samarthan dene ko taiyaar ho gaye
 a newspaper statement of Vastanvi was made a vanguard and he was declared to be the enemy of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and declared war on him
 arshad ne vastanvi ko kamjor karne ke liye moulana ajmal ko jamiyat se nikaal diya
 Here again Mahmud worked with politics and brought Ajmal with him
 vastanvi ne in donon kii dosti ko apane liye raahat mana or unhen lagane laga ki ve daarul ulum ko lekar chhidi varchasv kii ladaai main apana sammaan bachaae rakhane main safal ho jaaenge
 But politics showed its color and Vastanvi fell victim to it
 majalise-shura main majboot gutbandi he or jab tak jamiyat ke donon khemon ke bich koi samajhaita nahin hota, yah maan lenaa ki daarul ulum main sab kuch thik ho gaya he, thik nahin hoga kyonki jang abhi jari he
 The next phase of the fight will be seen when the four vacant places in Majlis-shura will be filled
 tab sadasyon ke sameekaran ek baar phir bane-bigadenge
 At present, the Vastanvi camp is under pressure, but their morale itself remains high
 majaak main hi sahi, ajmal ne india tude se kaha, ''jaise vastanvi ko murti baantne vaala or modi kaa hami bataakar badnaam kiya gaya or mohatamim pad se hataaya gaya, aise hi dar he ki kahin mujh par bhi aisa iljaam lagaakar shura se na hataa diya jaae
 "shura member of the Arshad camp and Qazi Maulana Manzoor Ahmad of Kanpur says," We wanted to remove Vastanvi at the Shura meeting on February 23, but we tried to bid him farewell with respect
 isiilie unhen 5 maheene kaa vakt diya gaya
 He himself had then announced that the inquiry committee report came against him or in favor, he would resign from the post of Mohatamim
 ''vastanvi isse inkaar bhi nahin karte
 They say they wanted a full investigation report, but a powerful lobby did not want to reveal the names of the students who were agitating against them and their supporting masters
 ''istipha na dene kaa meraa faisla aadhi-adhuri report ke kaaran tha
 "but Manzoor Ahmed says," Vastanvi had himself withdrawn the suspension of such students
 aise main ab unhen kaise kasuurvaar tehraaen
 "now it is to see how the forward path of Naumani will be in this battle and how much he will be able to save himself from the politics entered in Darul Uloom
" is vishwa prasiddh muslim shiksha sanstha kii raksha ke liye bani tahaffuj daarul ulum cameti ne vastanvi ko jabaran hataae jane or dastur kaa paalan na kiye jane ke maamle main supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhatane kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Soon a public interest litigation in this regard can be presented in the Supreme Court
 lagata he, vastanvi samarthak chup baithne vaale nahin hai
 Obviously, the war here can last long
 vaise, daarul ulum ke himachati chaahate hai ki yahaan vivaadon kaa jald se jald nipataara ho jaae

 Satyajit Ray had said, "I have made 17-18 films so far, out of which only two are original screenplays, the rest are based on stories or novels
" or mujhe lagata he ki lambii kahani film main tabdeel karne ke liye adarsh hoti he
 Ravi Bulle's stories also have a similar feeling
 unamem film main tabdeel hone kaa masala maujuud he
 Is sex
 terning points he
 Reality
 court room drama he
 Is a hero
 heroin he
 Is a villain
 kasaavat he
 But because of this, the importance of their stories cannot be underestimated in literary ways
 ve jivan kii vidambnaaon, aadhuniktaa kii nai bimariyon or samaaj kii talahati main chal rahi uthaa-patake ko bakhubi bayaan karte hai
 Their stories do not forcefully enter the mind anywhere, but you slip on them like butter and get overwhelmed by unintentional feeling
 vaise bhi aaj kaa cinema sachhee jindagi ke kareeb pahunch rahaa he, aisi hi aawaaj in kahaniyon se bhi aati hai
 What would have happened if this had not happened? Ravi has a second story collection
 isse pehle 2008 main unka kahani sangrah sapane aaine or vasantsena aayaa tha
 He has four long stories in this latest story collection
 sangrah kii pehali kahani main ek bayaan sari rudhipoon ko dhwast karti najar aati he
 The main character of the story is Chanda Masochist
 iskaa andaaj in linon se bakhubi lag jaataa he, ‘‘
 
 
 She used to manage her pain and sorrow like an event
 
 
 vah victim hoti thi or main acujd
 That patient, i doctor
 vah secretary, main bos
 He Strugler, i Producer
 kabhi yun hota ki vah house wif hoti or main pizza delivery boy kii tarah flats main entry karata
 This type of character is unique in Hindi literature
 kahani kii tone bhi hatakar he
 Deendayal Parashar of Exclusive Story is a tremendous example of current journalism
 yah bataati he ki kis tarah patrakarita main kaarobaar haaavee ho rahaa he or badalte maalik tathaa bos ke saath kis kadra puure offis kii hawa hi badal jaati he
 There is pressure on Deendayal, the aging of the story, to keep pace with the new environment, while the victim of marketism is also in the hands of the editor
 vah apni offis kalig priti kii baton se uttejnaa mahasoos karke uskaa fal apni patni ke saath chakhte hai
 Which exposes the role playing side of sex
 baaki do kahaniyaan yun na hota to kya hota or bhi baandhe rakhti he
 The characters of Ravi's stories invoke you
 haalanki atyadhik naatakeeyata kaa put ravi kii sabhi kahaniyon main haaavee rahata he-kahani kaa aisa ant jo soch or samaj se pare ho
 There is such a reality in his stories that many storytellers of his generation are untouched
 unki kahaniyon ko padhakar kahin se bhi gadhe hone kaa ehsaas nahin hota he
 She walks with ease
 unamem dekhe hue yatharth kii gandh he or kahani ke har tatv express raftaar se daudte hai
 Like any masala film, every dialogue and every scene makes sense
 kahani main ve kahin bhi atmugdhata kii ore nahin badhate hai or tathakthith bauddhikta ko thopate nahin hai
 The stories seem based on in-depth research and their USP is easy to connect

 comunaki shaayari itani dilkash he ki yakeen nahin hota ki ve peshey se faujee hai
 Not only this, he learned Urdu after being fond of saying Ghazal but still writes in Hindi
 urdu-hindi kii samaj kii vajah se asalam ali khan ‘gulshan’ kii shaayari main ravaanagi he
 In the deserted region of the outskirts, the horses of his imagination keep on running, and the words are filled with emotion
 30 saal kii umr main hi aise sher likhte hai ki ‘gulshan’ tuje har koi kahata he, tu koi purana shaayar lagata he
 On seeing the poetry of 'gulshan' it will be realized that there is a civilian within every military man, even if these two words are opposite of each other
 jaipur nivasee is shaayar ke walid bhi fouj main rah chuke hai, yani ghar main bhi sakht anushaasan kaa maahaul rahaa hoga
 Although he has studied up to the intermediate, but he closely watches the society and the environment around him, only then do poetry on almost every subject
 ve kehete hai: sanam tum hi bataao, zamana hamen kya kahegaa / jeb main kalam bhi he or haath main hathiyaar bhi he
 Like Ghalib, the military belongs to the dynasty but this Ahle Kalam says: i am 'gulshan', i am Faqat 'gulshan' / i am neither 'ghalib' nor i am 'mir'

 chhattisgarh main sharaab ke chalan ko lekar ajeeb si sthiti ban gai he
 In the wake of assembly elections, leaders and mlas who have come out on village contacts have had to face the ridiculous demand of women
 netaaon or vidhayakon kii majaburi ye he ki wo vaada bhi nahin kar sakate ki unke gaanv main sarkari sharaab kii dukaan or daaru bhatti kholane ko lekar wo prashasan ke saath jor aajamaaish karenge
 The women pleaded with the MLA to snatch the mike
 
 
 chhattisgarh sharaab kii khapat ke maamle main desh main tisare number par he
 Whether in urban areas or rural people have become addicted to alcohol, they have started thinking of it as their cultural drink
 had to tab ho gai, jab rajdhani raipur ke mahaj 30 kilometre dur dharsiva main mahilaon ne vidhayak ke haathon se mike chin liya or boli gaanv kii sharaab kii duukaane waapas kholo
 The incident is from Kura village
 ek kaarykram ke silsile main is gaanv main pahunche sthaneey vidhayak devji bhai patel graminon ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 At the same time, women who rose from the audience turned towards the stage in flare
 phir vidhayak ji se mike chin kar unke gaanv se hatai gai sharaab kii dukaanon ko phir se kholane kii maang kar di
 As the demand for women echoed in the mike, there was applause from the people sitting on the stage to the general audience, in fact, the women said that the government had shut down the government's Daru Bhatti in their village to beat the drunkenness
 lekin uske baad jo halaat bane use palat kar nahin dekha
 Illegal business started due to the closure of liquor shops
 Women said that large scale illegal liquor is sold in the entire village
 is sharaab kii bottle par uskaa mulya 60 rupee likhaa hota he, lekin sharaab bandi ke chalate mafia log ise 90 rupee main bechate hai
 People are also drinking more alcohol and are paying more than Rs
 30 per bottle in the process of collecting liquor

 The women asked the MLA ji what kind of liquor is this of the BJP government of the state
 maukey kii najaakat ko bhaanpate hue vidhayak ji ne aashwast kiya kii ve uchit kadam uthaaenge, or ve chalate bane
 BJP government 'dice' in reverse In Chhattisgarh, in the election year, the BJP government has taken many such steps to woo women who have become cancerous
 rajya main aanshik sharaab bandi ek aisa hi kadam he
 This year, the state government has implemented partial liquor ban in almost a hundred villages with population less than two thousand
 jin ilaakon main sarkari sharaab dukaane band huin vahaan sharaab kaa avaidh dhandha karne waalon ne pair pasaar liye
 The side effects of 'home delivery' of liquor have started to go door to door and street to street liquor

 Policemen are also giving protection to such businessmen because every month they are getting a lot of income from this business
 lekin rajya kii ek badi aabaadi iskaa dansh bhoga rahi he
 Due to the easy availability of alcohol to husbands, the economic conditions of the house are worsening, as well as the conditions of the village in the village as soon as the sun sets
 janpratinidhi bhi ho rahe hai shikaarachunavi saal main sharaab bandi kaa khamiyaja sirf mahilaon ko hi nahin bhogana pad rahaa he, balki iskaa shikaar janpratinidhi bhi ho rahe hai
 Voters demand Sharab from potential candidates

 Advani wrote in his blog, Pakistan's leadership did not handle the eastern part of Pakistan (the case) properly

 Nehru's attitude towards Jammu and Kashmir (taking the issue of Pakistan's attack on the state to the United Nations and agreeing on a separate constitution and separate flag for the state) could have brought about such dangerous repercussions

 pradhanmantri adarsh gram yojana main saansadon ko apane-apane kshetra ke kam se kam ek gaanv ko 2016 tak or duusare gaanv ko 2019 tak puri tarah viksit karne kaa lakshya diya tha
 Under this, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar adopted Paldev, a village on the border of Uttar Pradesh in Satna district of Madhya Pradesh
 is gaanv main 5000 ke kareeb log rahete hai jisamen 75 fisad anusuchit jati or pichde varg se aate hai
 What has changed in this adopted ideal village? yahi jaanane ke liye enditivi kii team is gaanv pahunchi
 The news of Prakash Javadekar's movement, meeting and inauguration was published at the time when Satna was going through the local newspapers
 is yojana ke tahat janabhagidaari se vikaas, saansad nidhi se bhi raashi kaa praavdhaan, antyoday kaa paalan, sarkari yojanaon kaa safal kriyanvan, langik samanta or mahilaon kaa sammaan, saamaajik nyaay kii guarantee, prakruti kaa sangrakshan, sthaneey saanskrithik viraasat kaa sangrakshan or protsaahan jaisi baaten bhi thim
 When the team reached the village, first of all the community building, the Panchayat office also runs here
 lekin din main takreeban 12 baje sab par taala jadaa tha
 It was adopted by the Human Resource Development Minister of the country, so the team reached the primary school in the area first
 5veen tak ke is skool main 13-14 bachche padhate hai, ek niyamit shikshak sabko padhaate hai
 The school was open but the students were absent
 paldev grampanchayat ke bansipur main kuch saal pehle tak praathmik skool ped ke neeche lagata tha bachche yaheen padhane aate the
 But now this building has been built, the color is lacquered
 sthaneey saathi gyaan shukla ne bataaya ki kaise pichley kuch dinon main building bani or rang-rogan hua
 Mohan Lal Anuragi, a teacher who teaches in the school, said that 14 children were admitted this year
 hamane poocha unhen mid de mile kaise miltaa he to unhone ek toote chuulhe kii taraf ishaara kiya jahaan do kute lete the
 Master ji claimed that the stove had cooked food a day before
 skool main bijli, kursi, teble kisi bhi cheez kii vyavastha nahin thi
 However, the Minister has stated on his website that the report of the village studies till 2016 is something that (union Minister Prakash Javadekar) means that soon after his adoption in November, the results doubled in 4-5 months straight
 baharhaal is parinaam ko zamin par parakhane ham ramadayal patel ke ghar pahunche ve apni natinon ko nijee skool bhejte hai, sarkari nahin
 He says that the standard of education in government school is not good
 ramadayal ke bete avadhesh to khaase naaraaz hai unka kahana he ki na sadak bani or na aspataal
 Awadhesh said, 'when the minister had adopted it was thought that he would make it heaven but made hell'
 avadhesh kaa kahana tha ki ummid thi ki aspataal, khel kaa maidan, kheti se sambandhit jaankaree milegi
 The same situation remains today
 team gaanv main jahaan-jahaan gai log manaregaa, rojgaar se lekar shauchalay ke nirmaan se lekar sawaal uthaate najar aae
 Sampatiya and her husband are potters and have their own complaints
 ve kehete hai mitti nahin milti, bacchon ke paas rojgaar nahin he
 Some people said that toilets not built were given just once, 6 thousand rupees
 manaregaa main kaam nahin miltaa he
 The situation in this village can be gauged from the fact that primary health center has not been opened in a population of 5000 people
 gaanv main jholachhap doctoron kii chaandi he, yaa phir chitrakoot, satna jaakar ilaaj kaa vikalp kyonki yahaan jo compounder hai wo bhi ghadi dekhakar dawaakhaana band kar dete hai
 Some villagers also say that Javadekar has done the road from Paldev to Brajpura at a cost of 13 lakhs and Paldev to Bargadha Purva for Rs 15 lakhs
 panchayat nae bhawan main shift ho chuki he
 School building was built, higher secondary was given and new building was given
 adarsh gaanv ghoshit hone ke baad 10 lakh rupye saaf-safai par kharch kiye gaye hai
 Minister in the name of beautifying school building, gym, pond, etc
 81
 96 lakh kharch kar diye
 Drains were built along the roads to the rough roads
 lekin uski haalat aap dekh sakate hai
 There is scarcity of water in the village, pipes arrived months ago but are kept in the courtyard of the sarpanch
 bhukhe pyaase gaanv main mantriji ne gym kaa bhi sapana bhi dekha tha
 Also wrote a blog with some pictures on the official website
 lekin jab hamane us dampatti ke bare main jaananaa chaahe jo training lekar aae the to pataa laga wo dilli ke the
 After Paldev went to the village of Chhindwara
 vahaan se dilli chale gaye
 It became a gymnasium, then it was locked and gym equipment is locked in the school building
 vivipat parchiyon ke auchak milan ko lekar supreme court ne mangalvaar ko saaf kiya he ki milan kaa kaam har vidhansabha kshetra main keval paanch matdaan kendron par hi hoga
 This means that when the votes are counted in the Lok Sabha elections on May 23, 10 of the country
 35 lakh matdaan kendron main se keval 20,600 kendron par hi yah kavayad hogi
 The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed the plea of leaders of 21 opposition parties seeking reconsideration of the apex court's April 8 order under which evms were increased from one to five polling stations in each assembly constituency
 The votes were ordered to be matched to VVPAT slips
 yah yachika andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu kii aguwai main vipaksh ke netaaon ne daayar kii thi
 On behalf of the petitioners, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi told the bench that the apex court had done the random matching of VVPAT slips to evms in every assembly constituency up to 5 polling stations but now they are demanding that it be at least Reduced to 25 percent
 iviem main pade maton or vivipat parchiyon ke milan kaa kaam kai vidhansabha chunaavon main kiya ja chukaa he, par loksabhaa chunaavon main yah kaam pehali baar kiya jayega
 The declaration of results did not have much effect till now the work of mixing slips was done for the selected center through lottery system for one polling station per assembly constituency
 haalanki, vivipat mashine sabhi matdaan kendron par lagaai gai he
 Highly placed sources in the Election Commission said that this process will not have much impact on the declaration of results
 unhone vistaar se bataate hue kaha, 'pratyaashee ko iviem se gananaa ke baad parinaam kaa pataa chal jayega, lekin isaki aadhikarik ghoshnaa main do se teen ghante kii deree ho sakati he
 He said that if the Election Commission assigns work to five different teams for surprise matching, there will be no delay in announcing the results
 unhone kaha, 'lekin agar sankhya paanch tiimon se kam hai to prayek stesan par lagane vaale samay ke anupaat main hi deree hogi
 'india has 4120 assembly seats and if multiplied by five, the slip will be matched at 20,600 polling stations
 chunaav ayog ke ek adhikari ke mutabik prayek matdaan centre par matadaataaon kii sankhya 800 se dhai hajaar tak ho sakati he
 Since there is no assembly in Chandigarh, Daman and Diu, Lakshadweep, Andaman and Nicobar, Dadra and Nagar Haveli
 isliye paanch matdaan kendron kaa chayan auchak hoga
 This means that 25 polling stations and additional ones will be added
 chunaav ayog ne 2014 ke aadesh kaa ullekh karte hue kaha tha ki paryvekshak or peethasin adhikari sabakuch jaanchane ke baad prayek chakra kii gananaa ke baad ummidavaar parinaamon par hastakshar karenge
 The Commission this time across the country 10
 35 lakh matdaan centre banaae hai jabaki 2014 main inaki sankhya 9
 28 lakhs, which means 10 this time
 1 pratishat kaa ijapha hua he
 Around 39
 6 lakh iviem mashine or 17
 4 lakh VVPAT machines have been used in these polling stations
 bataa den ki vivipat mashin aisa upkaran hota he jisamen se ek parchi nikalati he or usamen vah chunaav chihn ankit hota he jise ek vyakti ne vot dene ke liye chunaa hota he
 This slip originates within seven seconds and falls into a box
