 isaki vajah thi greek lekhak nicos kazanjakis Nikos Kazantzakis kii pustak 'jorba da greek' kii anuvadak shruti agarwal kaa maujuud hona
 After the books written in Indian languages, Artha, Sports, Human Senses, Kashmir and Kedarnath accident, we have now moved towards world literature, that too towards 'nirvana'
 nicos kazanjakis europe ke aise mahaan lekhak the, jinhen lagbhag nau baar nobel puraskaar ke liye sanstut kiya gaya tha
 His famous book has now been published in Hindi
 is satr kii khaas baat yah ki yahaan tak aate aate pustak meley kaa samay samaapt ho chukaa tha, par darshakon ke utsaah main kami nahin thi
 Regarding 'jorba the Greek', translator Shruti Agarwal had to say that when i was asked to write the role after the translation of this book, i wrote a line at the top, a book teaching the art of living life free
 yahaan main spasht karnaa chaahuungi ki yah jivan ko mukt hokar jeena sikhaati he na ki unmukt hokar
 There is a lot of difference between the free and the free
 1946 main yah kitaab unani bhashaa main ai thi
 Its importance can be gauged that when the English translation of 'jorba the Greek' was printed six years after its publication, the Anglo-literary world called it one of its biggest mistakes that it took so many years for this book to come into English
 Got it
 aap sochie ki jab angreji sahitya jagat yah mahasoos rahaa tha to hindi main to is kitaab ke chhapakar aane main sattar saal se bhi adhik kaa samay lag gaya
 Mother tongue, when we first speak mother word comes
 hindi main jo sukh or sukun he vah kisi or bhashaa main nahin
 That is why i translated this book into Hindi
 'jorba da greek' kahani he jorba naamak ek vyakti kii
 a person who meets a Greek writer
 yah lekhak khud nicos hai
 The person celebrates life and attains enlightenment
 jivan ko jite hue vah buddha kii tarah nirvana paata he
 Nationalism is the body of Indian journalism, why then? Why does Jorba say that he knows that he will never die
 isliye vah har pal aise jeeta he jaise ki uski jindagi abhi lagaataar chalani he
 That is why when he makes a mistake, someone makes a mistake, because he has not only suffered the disaster of the Second World War but has also been involved in it
 usne na keval yuddh kiya he, hatyaein va balaatkaar kiya he, kai galat kaam kiye hai, to unhen sudhaarney ke liye vah pashchaatap karte hue avsaad main nahin duubataa, balki jivan ko jeene kaa ek nayaa silsilaa shuru karata he, or duusare log jo galat kar rahe hai unhen rokane kii koshish karata he
 It is said that if you have to climb Everest, then the burden of the back has to be reduced
 yah kitaab kaa hindi main aana isliye bhi jaruri tha ki avsaad ke kaaran sirf aatmahatyaayein nahin ho raheen balki log jivan jeena chhod rahe hai
 Osho, who is said to be the greatest thinker of this century, has an impact on most of his ideas
 yah kitaab ek aise vyakti ke bare main he, jo buddha kii talash main yahaan-vahaan bhatak rahaa hota he, vah kisi se judata nahin, kyonki use lagata he yah moh kaa bandhan he
 Jorba then comes into his life as an employee
 jorba usko bataata he ki jab tak aap jivan ko utsaah se jioge nahin, usamen duuboge nahin tab tak usase virakt kaise hoge
 The 2013 catastrophe was Shiva's message that nothing but the temple at Kedarnath tells him that he had a habit of eating cherries when he was young
 vah use itani pasand thi ki chaahe jaise bhi vah use khaataa hi tha
 He also used to kill Cherry many times
 kai baar chori karke bhi khaataa tha
 Once he stole a silver coin and brought three to four baskets of cherries
 pehle to do-teen din tak ji bhar khaaya, par cheri khatm nahin hui to use niglana shuru kar diya
 As a result, he became so ill that Cherie hated him
 kitaab main nicos yah kehete hai ki agar aapako nirvana kii ore janaa he to use jite hue janaa he, uske har pahalu kaa anand nahin lenge to nirvana kaise paaenge
 The two main characters in this book are Boss and Jorba
 donon apane dhang se ji rahe hote hai, par nirvana kaa path jorba kaa path he
 That is why 'jorba the Greek' was followed by the book 'jorba the Buddha'
 yah kitaab keval kitaab nahin he
 This is a book that will change your life
 anuvadak shruti agarwal kaa kahana tha ki is kitaab ke liye maine apni naukari chhod di
 The reason was that Nikos' message was too big
 vah jivan se bhaagane kaa nahin use jeevantta se jeene kaa utsaah dete hai
 He says that if there is a mistake, try to improve it to the extent possible
 ishwar bhi dand main nahin sudhaar main vishwaas rakhata he
 This book is among the world's best-selling books
 is kitaab par bani film 1964 main mere janm se pehle aa chuki thi, uskaa anuwaad ab main chalis saal kii umr main kar paayi
 Satisfaction that he is being appreciated

 ghatana nainital ke ramnagar main sthit mashhoor garjia mandir kii he

 Despite the arrival of the police, the mob was being repeatedly killed
 vahiin gaganadip singh bheed kii pitayee se bachaane ke liye yuvak ko apane seene se chipka lete hai
 a video of this entire incident has also surfaced
 is video ko jo bhi dekh rahaa he vah gaganadip singh kii tarif kar rahaa he

 Along with the protests, those people had also stopped the devotees from going to the temple to pay obeisance, causing a lot of trouble to the devotees who came from far and wide
 lekin jab pradarshnakariyon kii maang sunne koi prashasnic adhikari nahin pahunchaa to pradarshnkaree acroshit ho gaye
 Angered by the administration's non-arrival, activists of the Bajrang Dal and other Hinduist organizations grabbed the lover couple sitting on the riverbank flowing next to the temple and started beating them
 mandir ke paas dauty par tainaatkashi gaganadip sinhaur ek anya pulicekarmi himmat karke bamushkil is acroshit bheed se yuvak ko bachaaya
 Gagandeep seated the girl by taking her to the priest's room and closing the door to protect the youth from the crowd
 kuch der main police force ke pahunchane par premi yugal ko kotwali le jaaya gaya
 Police said that the youth and the girl are residents of Kashipur Udham Singh Nagar
 police ne premi yugal ke parijanon ko bhi kotwali bulaayaa, jahaan ladki ko uske parijanon ko saunp diya gaya
 After the video went viral on social media, SSP Nainital Janmejaya Khanduri has given a reward of Rs 2500 to SI Gagandeep Singh and ordered to file a case against unknown people

 mamata ne kaha ki agar hadtaal jari rahi to kanoon ke mutabik karrwai kii jaaegi

 bhushan ne kaha, ‘‘ham keval yahi chaahate hai ki vah ek nishpaksh agency ke daayre ke bheetar aaye na ki aisi agency ke, jo swayan sarkaar ke adheen ho

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi 3rd in the 2009 Lok Sabha Elections
 50 lakh se adhik vot se amethi seat par jeet darj kii thi, lekin unke liye is karishme ko doharaa paanaa aasaan nahin dikh rahaa
 Recently, Sonia's entry into Amethi's battle is reinforcing this apprehension
 pichley 10 saalon main sonia ne kabhi amethi main chunavi raily nahin kii, lekin is chunaav main amethi main apane bete rahul ke prachaar ke liye khud sonia ko amethi janaa padaa
 Sonia made a passionate appeal to Rahul from Amethi people at the rally
 unhone kaha, 'maine amethi ko apana betaa diya he, khyaal rakhana
 The Amethi Lok Sabha seat has traditionally been a Congress bastion
 1980 main sanjay gandhi ne vahaan se chunaav ladaa or amethi main gandhi parivaar kii dastak hui
 Except for the 1998–99 Lok Sabha elections, this seat remained in the Congress account
 in donon chunaavon main yahaan gandhi-nehru parivaar se koi maidan main nahin tha
 Rahul is contesting the Lok Sabha elections for the third time here
 lekin pichley do chunaavon kii tulana main is baar aam aadmi party (aap) netaa kumaar vishwaas or bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kii netaa smriti irani kii maujuudagi ke kaaran yah chunaav rahul ke liye kathin mana ja rahaa he
 Political analyst Sanjay Kumar Pandey says that since Sonia's rally in Amethi, the apprehension that Rahul is contesting a tough election this time has been strengthened
 mana ja rahaa he ki amethi main khud sonia hi rahul ke liye chunauti ban gai hai
 Political analyst Vijay Upadhyay believes that compared to Amethi, Sonia's seat Rae Bareli has seen a lot of development in the last 10 years
 raibareli main pichley 10 varshon main rail coach kaarkaana, rail pahiyaa kaarkaana, akhil bhartiya ayurvigyaan santhaan (ames) or rashtriya str ke kai shikshan santhaan khule hai, jiske baad rojgaar ke paryaapt avasar vahaan paidaa hue he
 While Amethi is still backward
 sonia kii tulana main rahul apane kshetra main vikaas kaary karaane ke maamle main kamatar sabit hue hai
 The intense election campaigning of Kumar Vishwas has strengthened this belief
 aise main amethi fatah rahul ke liye is baar aasaan nahin maani ja rahi he
 Vishwas says that despite being a VVIP area, Amethi is severely lacking in basic amenities like electricity, water, roads and education

 Veteran actor and director Amol Palekar was repeatedly interrupted during a discussion at the National Museum of Modern Art (NGMA) in Mumbai in memory of painter Prabhakar Barve last week
 isi ke saath abhivyakti kii aazaadee par ek baar phir bahes chal padi
 Palekar was asked to remain focused on his subject
 ek aamantrit vaktaa ko vah nahin bolne diya gaya jo ve kahana chaahate the balki unki baat kaa majamoon un logon ne tay karne kii koshish kii, jinhone unhen bolne ke liye aamantrit kiya tha
 And then as soon as his talk was forced, the NGMA director reminded him on the microphone that he was speaking in 'a government gallery' as if he had saved the institution from any crime at the hands of Palekar
 barve ke simhavlokan kii curator jesal thakkar aupchaarik rup se engieme se sambhddha nahin hai
 But he insisted that the program was done to remember Barve and Palekar's speech was too deviant from the subject
 ve kahati hai, ''main kala or kalakaaron ke liye khadi hum or main palekar kaa virodh katai nahin kar rahi thi
 i did not intend to stop him from completing his speech
 yah keval unase nivedan karne ke liye tha ki ve ek aise kalakaar ke bare main zyada se zyada kisse yaa yaaden ham sabake saath saajha karen jinke nidhan ke 24 saal baad yah kaarykram kiya ja rahaa tha
 Suhas Bahulkar, an artist and former chairman of the NGMK advisory committee in Mumbai, had a similar point of view
 palekar kii shikaayat kaa labbolubaab yah tha ki unhone suna tha, engieme salaahkaar samitiyon ko khatm karne kii yojana bana rahaa he or vastav main samitiyaan pehle hi bhang ho chuki hai, isliye ab sarkari adhikari sambhawatah vaicharik yaa naitik aadhaar par nirnay karenge
 Talking on the phone, Bahulkar says that he had written to the government about alleged procedural changes, but "barve's exhibition should have been devoted to the loyalty and honesty of the artist
" '' ve kehete hai ki yah 'vastav main dukhad' he ki is mudde kaa raajnneetikaran kiya gaya he
 The NGMA claims from the government that the system of advisory committees has not been abolished
 hua bas itnaa he ki un samitiyon kaa kaarykaal puraa ho gaya he or ve ab 'punargathan kii prakriya main' hai
 One aspect of Palekar's concern is also with the ngma's policy in which the institution has shown a clear desire to showcase as much of its permanent collection as possible, which leaves less room for new work
 isi vajah se pehle hi sudhir patavardhan or mehali gobhai jaise kalakaaron ke kaam ko pradarshit karne kii jagah uski ddeergha main nahin mil saki or kaarykram ko radd karnaa padaa
 Perhaps responding to the issues raised by Palekar, the NGMA has said that a decision on how much space will be available for rent is yet to be made
 ek press conference or vibhinn saakshatkaaron main palekar ne kaha ki unke auchity par jis prakaar prashn khadey karke unhen pareshaan kiya gaya tha, usase ve hatprabh the
 There are other ways to discuss an artist's achievements apart from just discussing an artist's work
 unhone kaha ki yadi unhen yah pataa hota ki kya bolnaa he or kya nahin, yah unhen thakkar ke saath pehle hi charchaa karke tay karnaa hota to unhone nimantran ko sweekaar hi nahin kiya hota
 Palekar said that he was 'hurt' by the constant interruptions and silence of the 'senior artists' sitting in the room
 is bare main koi spashtikaran nahin diya gaya he ki ve bhaashan samaapt kyon nahin kar sake
 However, the organizers believed that the things they were saying were not in line with the program
 ek aamantrit vaktaa jo khud bhi ek bade kalakaar hai or jo barve ko vyaktigat rup se jaanate the, use apni baat khulkar kehane kii aazaadee kyon nahin di ja sakati bhale hi vah vishay se thodaa bhi itar ja rahi ho

 Since the great success of the first T20 Cricket World Cup in 2007, questions were raised about the future of Test and 50-over cricket
 lekin ab tak tii-20 simit overon ke cricket main 50 over ke maichon kaa 'chota bhai' hi bana rahaa he
 Cricket World Cup being held in australia-new Zealand will not only be the biggest cricket tournament but will also decide the future direction of 50-over cricket
 1-tii-20 se 'khatre' ko dekhte hue isisi ne pehle hi niyamon main tabdili kar di he

 The 2-T20 started making its impact on one-day before the new rules came in
 1971 main pehle khele gaye pehle van-de se lekar november 2012 tak ek pari main ausatan 228 ran bane jo ab badhate-badhate 246 ho gaye hai

 Sixteen years ago, captain Steve Waugh's Australian team came to India with the desire to win the final frontier
 series ke pehle test main australia ne dilli main bharat ko patkhni de di thi or kolkata ke duusare test main bhi pehali pari main 445 ke score ke saath mehmaan team haaavee nazar aa rahi thi
 Harbhajan Singh got hat-trick wickets in the first innings (the fifth, sixth and seventh wickets of Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist and Shane Warne)
 uske baad duusari pari main vivies lakshmana or rahul dravid kii aitihaasik pariyon ke alaava bhajji kaa duusari pari main chah wicket hasil karnaa naa sirf bharat ke liye aitihaasik sabit hua, australian dabadabaa bhi chakanachur ho gaya
 Apart from England, only the Indian team has done the feat of winning despite the follow-up
 darasal bhartiya team 2001 or phir 2008 main australia ke mishan final frontier ko fel karne main kaamyaab rahi
 First, Steve Waugh and then Ricky Ponting's 16 consecutive victories in the Test broke in India
 is baar duniya ke number 1 test ballebaaz steven smith bhi itihaas banane kaa iraadaa lekar aae hai
 Before the first Test, captain Virat Kohli also praised Steven
 unka kahana he ki ek leg spinner olerounder se lekar duniya ke number 1 ballebaaz banane kaa smith kaa safar vaaki kaabile taareef he
 On the other hand Smith has said that he will not stop his team from sledging
 haalanki, viraat ke kilaaf bhi sledging ko lekar wo zarur sachet hai
 In fact, this time around a month already, the current and former players of the Australian team are making a careful statement against India
 halaat kuch is tarah hai jaise australian khemaa bharat kii tarah or bhartiya khemaa australia kii tarah vyavhaar kar rahaa he
 Cricketer Harbhajan Singh said, "if Australia plays well then they will lose 3-0 or else the result is 4-0
 " Before the Pune Test, Steven Smith was seen responding to Harbhajan carefully and politely
 smith ne test match se pehle press conference main kaha, "ham jaanate hai ki hamen anderdog mana ja rahaa he
 So Harbhajan said that we will lose 4–0
 lekin ham aisa nahin sochate
 "he also says that as a captain, he will always be on the lookout for opportunities when and how to find opportunities for an attack against India
 wo kehete hai ki ye ek 'taff' series hogi
 Coach Anil Kumble and captain Virat Kohli say in unison that they are not giving special attention to the Australian team
 viraat to yahaan tak kehete hai, "mere khyaal se england bhi ek top quality team thi
 He had more experience than this Australian team
 lekin hamane pichhali series ke anubhavon se samaj liya he ki agar in halaat main vipakshi team par lagaataar dabaav banaaya jaae to kamyaabi mil sakati he
 We did the same then and will still do so
 " This series will announce the best in the test
 kai jaankaar kah rahe hai ki series ke baad duniya kii number 1 team bharat (ICC ranking main 121 point) or duniya kii number 2 australia (ICC ranking main 109 point) team ke bich faaslaa or bada ho jayega
 The Australian team has lost 9 consecutive Tests in Asia
 ye silsilaa yahaan tham jayega, aisa is vakt kahana mushkil nazar aa rahaa he
 By the way, Virender Sehwag believes that if Dij seems to be the law of averages, then the Indian team can play a Test draw or even lose in the series
 smith kii team chaahe to sahvaag ke bayaan se apane hausale buland kar sakati he
 It is astonishing that this time, the Australian attitude is changed or changed
 ranneeti, mindgem or vipakshi khilaadi se lekar sledging tak kangaroo tevar lagaam main kase dikh rahe hai
 On the other hand the Indian team is talking in the same style
 coach anil kumble kii tarah captain viraat kaa fokas apni team ke lakshya par he jabaki mehmaan team bhartiya ranneeti ke mutabik edjust karti nazar aati he
 The comments pune kii pich ko lekar tasviir saafe dikh rahi he
 Therefore, no major surprise is seen regarding the strategy or team selection of the first Test
 pich curator pandurang salgaonkar kehete hai ki pich duusare-tisare din se turn karegi magar ye pich jabardast turnar sabit nahin hogi
 Captain Virat Kohli is also expecting a similar pitch
 aamtaur par sledging ko bada hathiyaar banane vaali australian team, viraat kohli ke prati apane ravaiye ko lekar saavdhaan he
 But Virat seems to be most inattentive
 NDTV se baat karte hue purv captain sunil gavaskar bhi kehete hai ki series se pehle sledging par zarurat se zyaada jor diya ja rahaa he
 Captain Virat, who has been away from defeat in 19 consecutive Tests, is clear that Team India will try to break them by constantly pressing against Australia like in the previous series
 foloan ke baavjood jeet hasil karne kaa karnama cricket itihaas main england ke alaava sirf bhartiya team ne kar dikhaaya
 In fact, the Indian team managed to fail in Australia's mission final frontier in 2001 and again in 2008
 pehle steve wa phir riki ponting ke test main 16 lagaataar jeet kaa silsilaa bharat aakar tut gaya
 This time world number 1 Test batsman Steven Smith has also come up with the intention of making history
 pehle test se pehle captain viraat kohli ne bhi steven kii jamkar taareef kii
 He says Smith's journey from a leg-spinner all-rounder to becoming the world's No
1 batsman is truly commendable
 duusari taraf smith ne kaha he ki wo apni team ko sledging se nahin rokenge
 However, he is also conscious of sledging against Virat
 darasal is baar qareeb maheene bhar pehle se hi australian team ke maujuuda or purv khilaadi bharat ke kilaaf saavdhaanee se bayaanbazi kar rahe hai
 The situation is like the Australian camp is behaving like India and the Indian camp is behaving like Australia
 cricketer harbhajan singh ne kaha, "agar australia acha khelti he to 3-0 se haaregi varanaa nateeja 4-0 tay he
 " pune test se pehle steven smith harbhajan kaa jawaab sanbhalkar or vinamrata se dete nazar aae
 Smith said at the press conference before the Test match, "we know that we are being considered underdogs
 isliye harbhajan ne kaha ki ham 4-0 se haarenge
 But we do not think so
 " wo ye bhi kehete hai ki ek captain hone ke naate wo hameshaa aise mauqe kii talash main rahenge ki kab or kaise bharat ke kilaaf akraman ke mauqe dhunde jaaen
 They say it will be a 'tuff' series
 coach anil kumble or captain viraat kohli ek sur main kehete hai ki wo australian team ko khaas tavajjo nahin de rahe
 Virat even goes on to say, "I think England was also a top quality team
 unke paas is australian team se zyaada anubhav tha
 But we have understood from the experiences of the previous series that if there is constant pressure on the opposition team in these circumstances, then success can be achieved
 hamane tab bhi aisa hi kiya tha or ab bhi aisa hi karenge
 " ye series test main best kaa elaan karegi
 Many experts are saying that after the series, the gap between the world's No
1 team India (121 points in ICC rankings) and the world No
2 Australia (109 points in ICC rankings) team will get bigger
 australian team asia main lagaataar 9 test haar chuki he
 This sequence will stop here, it seems difficult to say at this time
 vaise virendra sahvaag kaa maananaa he ki Dij lau of everejez lagata he to bhartiya team series main ek test drow khel sakati he yaa haar bhi sakati he
 If Smith's team wants, it can boost its spirits with Sehwag's statement
 kamaal kii baat he ki is baar australian tevar badale-badale yaa sanbhale-sanbhale nazar aate hai
 From strategy, mind games and opposition players to sledging, Kangaroo is seen in the tavar lagam
 duusari taraf bhartiya team ek hi andaaz main baat kar rahi he
 Like coach Anil Kumble, captain Virat is focused on his team's goal while the visiting team seems to be adjusting according to the Indian strategy
 tippaniyan The picture is clearly visible on the Pune pitch
 isliye pehle test kii ranneeti yaa team chayan ko lekar koi bada sarprize saamne nazar aata nahin dikhataa
 Pitch curator Pandurang Salgavkar says that the pitch will turn from the second or third day but this pitch will not prove to be a strong turner
 captain viraat kohli bhi kuch aisi hi pich kii ummid kar rahe hai
 The Australian team, who usually make sledging a big weapon, is careful about their attitude towards Virat Kohli
 magar viraat in sabase beparwaah dikhte hai
 Speaking to NDTV, former captain Sunil Gavaskar also says that there is an excessive emphasis on sledding before the series
 lagaataar 19 test main haar se dur rahe captain viraat kaa ishaara saafe he ki team india pichhali series kii tarah hi australia ke kilaaf bhi lagaataar dabaav banaakar unhen todane kii koshish karegi
 He says Smith's journey from a leg-spinner all-rounder to becoming the world's No

 lagaataar 19 test main haar se dur rahe captain viraat kaa ishaara saafe he ki team india pichhali series kii tarah hi australia ke kilaaf bhi lagaataar dabaav banaakar unhen todane kii koshish karegi
 Coach Anil Kumble and captain Virat Kohli say in unison that they are not giving special attention to the Australian team
 viraat to yahaan tak kehete hai, "mere khyaal se england bhi ek top quality team thi
 He had more experience than this Australian team
 lekin hamane pichhali series ke anubhavon se samaj liya he ki agar in halaat main vipakshi team par lagaataar dabaav banaaya jaae to kamyaabi mil sakati he

 Many experts are saying that after the series, the gap between the world's No

 Crisis on coalition, in the by-elections in 2 seats in the state, the way Mayawati supported the Samajwadi Party , she wants the same support from Akhilesh Yadav in Rajya Sabha
 rajyasabha chunaav main agar koi bhi chook akhilesh yadav se hui to iskaa khamiyaja gathbandhan ko uthaanaa pad saktaa he or yah baat akhilesh puri tarah samaj rahe hai
 This is the reason why Akhilesh, who is angry with his uncle till now, has also openly appealed to Shivpal Yadav for support
 mana ja rahaa he ki agar naresh agarwal, raja bhaiya or shivpal yadav ne apane samarthakon ke saath khel kar diya to bispi ke ummidavaar kaa jeet paanaa mushkil hoga, lekin jeet ke baad is gathbandhan ke hausale buland hai or lagata he ki unke vidhayak party se baghawat kaa rasta shaayad hi chune or bijepi ko yahi baat sabase zyada khatak rahi he
 a major problem of the ruling BJP in the Vaishya state against Dalit is that it has fielded its candidate against the Dalit candidate and that too in the name of Bhimrao Ambedkar and that too of the Vaishya caste
 aise main daliton ke bich paith banane kii koshishon main juty bijepi ko is baat kaa jawaab bhi dena pad saktaa he ki usne bhimrao ambedkar ke naam ko haraane kii koshish kyon kii
 Let us know that before the results of the by-elections, BJP had made up its mind to defeat the Samajwadi Party too
 yahi vajah he ki usne 2 candidet or utaare the lekin rajyasabha kii haar ke saath hi un donon ummidawaron ne apane parche waapas le liye
 On the one hand, the coalition is stuck in a vortex of victory and defeat, then the BJP is stuck in the maze of contesting the Vaishya candidate against the Dalit
 Now it will have to be seen that on whom this election of Rajya Sabha falls
 uttar pradesh ke mainpuri jile main ek dussahasik vaardaat ko anjaam dete hue luteron ne ek bank main ghuskar pachaas lakh rupee kii nagdi or gahane lut liye

 PM Modi's visit to Varanasi is important in many ways, but the things he said to improve the condition of millions of weavers there are pivotal
 unka yah kahana ki har maa chaahati he ki uski beti apni shaadi par banarsi sari pahane, bahut hi doordarshee bayaan he
 Banarasi sarees have been the hub of sarees for centuries
 ve beti kii shaadi main di jane vaali ek dharohar hoti hai
 Banarasi saris have not only given Varanasi a reputation but have also provided livelihood to thousands of weavers and artisans there
 isse vahaan kii arthvyavastha chalati he or hajaaron gharon main chulhaa bhi jalataa he
 But in recent years, the business of Banarasi sarees has been eclipsed
 inaki bikri kam hone lagi
 Interest in the new generation of girls was reduced, middlemen also cheated the weavers, the state government did nothing for them
 natijatan kisi samay bharat kii shaan kahi jane vaali banarsi saadiyaan gumnami ke andhere main khone lageen
 On the one hand, the problem of livelihood arose in front of the weavers, on the other hand a flourishing business began to remain
 sari bunane kaa pushtaini dhandha khatm hone laga or rojgaar kii talash main bunakar tathaa karigarpalaayan karne lage
 Nobody has cared for them
 yah dekhte hue bhi ki zyaadaatar bunakar alpsankhyak hai, unke hiton kii lambii-chaudee baaten karne vaali raajnneetik partiyaan chuppi saadhe raheen
 Nothing was done for them
 ab piem ne is baat kaa zikr karke banarsi saadiyon ke kaam main lage hajaaron bunakaron ke liye sunahare bhavishya kaa tanabana bunane kii koshish kii he
 Those who are familiar with the various aspects of the Indian economy will know that the Indian textile industry, which has been running for hundreds of years, is the second largest industry in the country and it directly employs three and a half million people and almost equal number of people are indirectly engaged in it
 Has happened
 angrejon ne ise nasht karne ke liye kaaphi kuch kiya lekin ve safal nahin hue
 But it also protected itself under adverse circumstances
 desh ke kone-kone main based lakhon kaarigaron ne apana pet katkar ise bachaaya
 India's clothes have been exported all over the world, but the recession in 2009 put it in trouble
 hamaare export par iskaa bura prabhaav padaa or hajaaron ikaiyaan band ho gayi
 Millions of artisans became unemployed
 china ke silk ne hamaare silk udyog ko sankat main daal diya or iske saamne astitv kaa sawaal khadaa ho gaya
 It also affected Banarasi sarees
 khushi kii baat he ki piem modi ne banarsi saadiyon kaa zikr karke is udyog kii ore sabhi kaa dhyaan khinchaa he
 It can be expected that they will be listened to and big steps will be taken to promote this industry

 trinmul bengal kii 42, left partiyaan kerala kii 20 or kesiar kii tiares telugana kii 17 siton par lard rahi hai
 Although Chandrababu Naidu and Jagan Mohan Reddy are face to face in 25 seats in Andhra Pradesh, both are neither with the NDA nor with the UPA
 odisha main 21 siton par naveen patnayak majboot sthiti main hai
 In this way, there are a total of 205 such seats where if the BJP is not able to achieve great success then the combined seats of these regional parties will be so much that they can demand support from UPA or Congress
 morche kii pahal kyontamilnadu ke ek rajnatik tikaakar en
 Ashokan says that "regional parties never want an absolute majority government of any national party
" 2014 main bhaajapa kii purna bahumat kii sarkaar banane ke baad kshetreey dalon kaa mahatv centre sarkaar main bachaa hi nahin
 The 2019 election brings an opportunity in which the role of regional parties will become important if the BJP does not get a majority on its own
 '' haalanki kesiar kii mahatvakanksha is siyaasi avasar kii ummid se adhik he
 They are not only wishing that UPA or NDA should stay away from the majority at the Center and depend on regional parties to form the government
 raav apane feedback ke aadhaar par yah maanakar chal rahe hai ki congress 100 se 110 seat par aakar simat jaaegi or bhaajapa bhi 125-150 siton se zyada nahin jeet sakegi
 TRS leader V
 vinod kumaar kehete hai ki ''bhaajapa or congress donon milakar kul 250 se zyada siten nahin jeet sakengi
 While the number of seats for non-bjp-non-congress parties is expected to be 150-160
 '' lekin itani siton se hi centre main sarkaar kaise banegi? kumaar kii raay main, ''tabhi to kesiar stallin or palanisvami ke sampark main hai
 "that is, the parties involved in KCR UPA and NDA are also seriously engaged in the initiative of forming the United Front Government at the Center by bringing the united front banner
" kitni aasaan he yah raahakesiar bhale sanyukt morche ke liye pahal kar rahe hon lekin unki raah aasaan nahin he
 The big question is about the leadership of the front
 daavedaaron main mamata, mayawati, chandrababu or khud kesiar sareekhe netaa hai
 It is difficult to reach agreement among each other
 duusari badi dikkat upie or endie ke saathiyon ko shaamil karne ko lekar hogi
 Leaders of parties such as NCP, RJD, DMK, LJP, LOSP, Shiv Sena, Apna Dal are comfortable joining as allies of national parties but go beyond the national parties banner and avoid taking part in an alliance whose leader or party The form is not national
 teesri dikkat he, morche main jin dalon ke shaamil hone kii baat kii ja rahi he unamem kai ne apane rajyon main ek duusare ke virodh main chunaav ladaa hai
 For example, Chandrababu Naidu and Jagan Mohan Reddy in Andhra Pradesh, TMC and Left parties in Bengal
 in tamaam vipareet paristhitiyon ke bich sanyukt morche kii ummid yaa pahal kaa bhavishya kya he? kesiar ke kareebi ek netaa kehete hai, ''desh ke zyaadaatar rajnatik dalon main jis tarah kaa modi virodh he, use dekhte hue tamaam vipareet sthitiyon ke baavjood sanyukt morche kaa gathan saral or sambhav he
 The parties involved in Congress or UPA will also readily agree to support this front
 kyonki modi ko rokna hi sabhi dalon kii pehali praathamikta he
 "at present, KCR is in constant touch with leaders of various parties to form a united front
" bahut jald ve akhilesh yadav, mayawati, sharad pavaar, tejasvi yadav, nitish kumaar or naveen patnayak se mulaakaat karenge
 TRS leaders confirm that KCR is planning to meet leaders of several parties in the next few days
 or kam-se-kam 23 may tak to milenge hi

 Pakistan's Imran Nazir is at number two in strike rate and England's Kevin Pietersen at number three

 isse logon ko phayda nahin hoga
 i also believe that the people in Uttar Pradesh will not benefit from MNREGA because all the money will be consumed by ministers, officers and contractors
 maurya ne kaha ki mukhyamantri manaregaa ko lekar raajnneeti kiye jane kii sakht virdohi hai
 People of the state are being misled regarding MNREGA, while everyone is aware that in the last three years, Uttar Pradesh is far ahead of other states in the implementation of MNREGA
 saath hi nunatam mazdooree tay karne main uttar pradesh desh kaa pehla rajya he
 Maurya said that the Crown Prince of Congress should know that in Uttar Pradesh for the last two decades the people have marginalized the Congress

 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki is abhiyaan se logon kokhule main shouch karneroka ja saktaa he
 When asked by Jyotiraditya Scindia about the allegations made by Singhar on the former Chief Minister Singh, he said, "the allegations are serious and both sides should talk on this
" sarkaar ko apane dam or aadhaar par chalanaa chahie, kisi kaa hastkshep sarkaar main nahin hona chahie
 There are no two opinions in this
 ' unhone aage kaha, 'sarkaar ko swatantra hokar kaary karnaa chahie
 On the issues that have come up, the Chief Minister should also listen to Minister Umang Singhar and action should be taken on what is true
 'bataa den ki purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh ne mantriyon ko patr likhakar mulaakaat kaa samay maanga tha, jo viral ho gaya tha
 Forest Minister Singhar was angry with this
 iske baad unhone digvijay par sharaab kaarobaariyon, avaidh khanan karne waalon ko sangrakshan dene kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Public relations minister of the state PC PC Sharma had attacked Singhar on this
 maamle ke tool pakadaney par mukhyamantri kamalnath ne hastkshep kiya tha
 Singhar met the Chief Minister on Tuesday night
 sutron ke anusaar, mulaakaat ke dauraan mukhyamantri ne singhar ko hidaayat di
 Singhar appeared in front of the media on Wednesday afternoon and said that he had spoken to Chief Minister Kamal Nath and state in-charge Bavaria
 unke saamne apni baat rakh di he, ab unhen kuch nahin kahana he
 Meanwhile, the same effigy was burnt outside forest minister Umang Singhar's house in Bhopal, the Congress activists who burnt the effigy said that unless Umang Singhar will not apologize to Digvijay Singh, he will keep opposing him
 is bich congress ke varisht netaa jyotiraditya sindhiya kaa bayaan aayaa kaha sarkaar main bahari hastkshep nahin hona chaiye
 The government should work independently, the Chief Minister should listen to Umang ji, the issues that have come up should work on what is true
 digvijay singh ji se bhi baat kii jaani chaiye
 At the same time, senior Congress MLA Aindal Singh Kanshana demanded the dismissal of Umang Singhar
 unhone kaha ki mukhyamantri ko aise bayaan dene vaale mantriyon par tatkaal karrwai kerani chaiye
 He said that Digvijay Singh formed the government, his biggest contribution in forming the government was that his life was impeccable
 unhone maang kii mukhyamantri umang singhar, govind singh, govind singh rajput, imarti devi pradhyumna singh tomars ko barkhaast karen
 Almost all of these names are from Scindia Sarmathakas
 jawaab duusare gut se bhi aayaa sindhiya samarthak parivahan mantri govind rajput ne bhi digvijay singh par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki sarkaar main digvijay singh ko hastkshep karne kaa koi adhikaar nahin he
 He is violating the rights of ministers and not allowing them to work independently
 vahiin shram mantri mahendra singh sitaudiya ne kaha janata ne bijepi ke naare maaf karo maharaj ko nakaarte hue pradesh main congress ko bahumat diya or sarkaar banaai
 Where was Digvijay Singh ji when the Congressmen were struggling on the streets
 vahiin jabalpur se cabinet mantri lakhan ghanghoria ne digvijay kaa paksh lete hue kaha ki unhone mantriyon ko patr likhakar koi galat kaam nahin kiya vah bade netaa hai kisi bhi mantri se jawaab sawaal kar sakate hai
 At the same time, Alirajpur District Congress President Mahesh Patel called Umang Singhar a BJP broker
 dhar se vidhayak heeralaal alaava ne bhi sarkaar ke prati asantosh prakat kiya he
 Alava said that the government is not protecting the interests of the tribals, so Independent MLA Surendra Singh Shera also clearly said that our future in this government is not secure
 udhar bijepi congress ke khinchataan par thahaake laga rahi he
 BJP spokesperson Rahul Kothari said that the only work of Congress workers is to make their organization do what they are doing, be Scindia, Digvijay, Umang Singhar and the people of Kamal Nath themselves are not following any back, as a political activist i did not see any worse days from any party

 ninda raschekhav kii ek kahani yaad aa rahi he
 a woman is condemning the husband of a friend to her husband

 Earns money by dishonesty
 kahati he ki main us saheli kii jagah hoti to aise pati ko tyaag detii
 Then her husband reveals to her the secret that he himself makes so much money by dishonesty
 sunakar stri stabdh rah jaati he
 Did she abandon her husband? Yes, she went to another room
 kabhi-kabhi aisa bhi hota he ki hamamen jo karne kii kshamta nahin he, vah yadi koi karata he to hamaare pilpile ahankaar ko dhakka lagata he, hamamen hinata or glani aati he
 Then we are satisfied by condemning him and considering him as good
 ek mitra kii mulaakaat ke kareeb das-baarah ghante baad yah sab man main aa rahaa he
 Now something has become neutral
 subah jab uske saath baitha tha tab main swayan ninda ke kaala sagar main duubataa utaraata tha, kalol kar rahaa tha
 There is not much condemnation in condemnation
 surdaas ne isliye ise ninda sabad rasaal kaha he

 Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman was speaking in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, when Union Skill Development Minister Mahendra Nath Pandey and Union Minister of State for Steel sitting on his left Faggan Singh Kulaste was seen sitting in the house taking a nap, while the state of central finance Ri and BJP MP Anurag were Thakur yawning

 This is so cute so you get to have this cute reaction every morning?! My heart ~that was wonderful, thank you so much for sharing
 Your little one brightened my very dismal day
 xxxthis is honestly one of the most adorable things that I've ever seen 🥰 Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP has returned to power with a thumping majority
 nai sarkaar kii gathan kii kavayad tej ho gai he
 On the other hand, steps are to be taken to change the BJP organization
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah pehali baar loksabhaa chunaav jitkar sansad pahunche hai or party adhyaksh ke taur par unka kaarykaal pehle hi puraa ho chukaa he
 In such a situation, if Shah will be elected BJP President again for the second time or will he become a minister in the Modi government and another leader will become the President? Let me tell you that during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP President was Rajnath Singh
 centre kii satta main prachand bahumat se aane ke baad rajnath ko modi sarkaar main grahamantri kii jimmedaari saunpi gai to unhone party adhyaksh kaa pad chhod diya tha
 Amit Shah was then crowned as BJP President after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 is tarah se amit shah ne rajnath ke bache do saal ke kaarykaal ko puraa kiya tha
 After this, in January 2016, Amit Shah became the BJP President for the second time
 shah kaa teen saal kaa puraa kaarykaal isi saal janvari 2019 main puraa ho chukaa he
 However, before the completion of Shah's term, in September 2018, a meeting of the party's executive was resolved that the party would return to power in 2019, winning a major victory from the 2014 elections
 iske liye amit shah loksabhaa chunaav tak party ke asthaayee adhyaksh rahenge
 In this way, the BJP under Shah's leadership has returned to power by winning more than 2014 seats in 2019
 dilachasp baat ye he ki bijepi ke samvidhan ke anusaar, ek aadmi do hi baar puure kaarykaal ke liye party kaa adhyaksh ban saktaa he
 However, Amit Shah completed the first term of Rajnath Singh
 isliye takneekee taur par unka abtak ek hi kaarykaal puraa hua he
 According to the bjp's constitution, the national president of the party can be the same person who has been a member of the party for at least 15 years
 iske alaava bijepi main rashtriya adhyaksh kaa 'chunaav' nirvaachak mandal dwaara kiya jaataa he, jisamen rashtriya parishad ke sadsy or pradesh parishadon ke sadsy shaamil hote hai
 It is also written in the bjp's constitution that any 20 members of the electoral college can jointly propose the name of the person contesting the election for the post of national president
 yah sanyukt prastaav kam se kam aise paanch pradeshon se aana jaruri he, jahaan rashtriya parishad ke chunaav sampann ho chuke hon
 Also, the candidate must be approved on the nomination form
 haal hi main sampann loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko mili karaari haar 129 saal puraani party ke liye shaayad ab tak kaa sabase gaharaa sankat he or isaki viraasat ko aage badhaane vaale parivaar ke liye badi chunauti he
 The vision and legacy of Rabindranath Tagore who first expressed the concept of Indian freedom struggle and India is in danger
 baat yah nahin he ki congress kaa safaya ho gaya he, balki mahatvapurn yah he ki jeetne vaale kii prakruti bahut myne rakhti he
 The rss-led forces had nothing to do with the Indian national movement
 aresas ne swatantraaa sangram ke antim ufaan yani 'bharat chodo’ andolan ke samay bhi apane kader ko dur rahane or 'asli’ ladaai ke liye apni urja bachaae rakhane ke liye kaha tha
 His real fight meant fighting against Muslims
 mahatma gandhi kii hatya ke liye bhi yahi takatein jimmedaar thim
 For this reason, the first Home Minister of Azad India banned the RSS and imprisoned 25,000 of its workers
 yahi takatein ab loksabhaa main baari bahumat ke saath desh kii satta par kabiz ho gai hai
 Does this mean that the concept of India that our nationalist leaders had coined is now dead? Less than one-third of the voters (around 31 per cent) have voted for the BJP
 iske baavjood unhen hamaari 'jisko zyada vot, vah jeeta’ vaali chunaav pranali kii vajah se badi sankhya main siten milin
 There is a dire need to reform this election system
 lekin congress kya is sthiti ko ulatney ke liye vishaal sankhya vaale un logon kii kshamtaaon kaa bharpoor istemaal kar paaegi, jinhone bijepi kii vibhaajanavaadee chhavi or uske dakshinpanthi agenda ko vot nahin diya he?is sawaal kaa jawaab is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki congress apni is abhootpurv haalat ke liye jimmedaar kaarnon ko kitne sateek dhang se samaj paati he or is baat kii bhi padtaal kar paati he ki bijepi ko itani badi jeet kyon mili
 Her return will also depend on how clearly she plans for the future
 isaki shuruyaat ham bijepi ke diggaj netaa laalkrishna adwani ke ek bayaan se kar sakate hai
 He had said that the bjp's victory was a result of the Congress's misrule, the government's failure to curb inflation and Narendra Modi's 'event management' ability to take advantage of this situation
 congress kii haar or bijepi ke ubhaar ke liye jimmedaar in kaarnon main kuch anya karkon ko bhi joda ja saktaa he
 First, the BJP strongly polarized Hindu votes in big states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam and Gujarat
 doosraa, bhartiya korporate jagat main dakshinpanthi aarthik agenda kaa is tarah se safaltaapurvak prachaar ki unhone modi ko samarthan dene ke liye bhartiya itihaas main pehali baar lagbhag sarvasammati se ek vibhaajankaree sampradayik gathjod ko apana puraa sahyog dene kaa faisla kar liya
 In Germany, merchants and oligarchs also gave similar support to Adolf Hitler to power
 desh ke korporate jagat ne apane sapane puure karne kii khatir hi yah sahyog diya
 In the dreams of the corporate world, the environment and the social, democratic concerns of millions of poor Indians were not given any place
 haal hi main congress ke paarit kiye gaye kai adhikaar-aadhaarit kanoonon kii shrinkhalaa main bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak kaa sabase upar hona korporate jagat ke liye bardaasht se baahar ho gaya
 Manmohan Singh, who has been a cherished of the corporate world for more than two decades, suddenly became unacceptable as he was seen as a person incapable of benefiting the corporate class through various scams and capturing natural resources
 teesraa, congress ne utsaahhin or netritv-viheen chunaav prachaar kiya
 In a large part of the country, he was not even seen as a rival party
 yahaan tak ki rajasthan jaise congress ke majboot janaadhar vaale rajya main bhi vah damakham ke saath chunaav maidan main nahin dikhaai di
 One thing to remember is that in states where regional parties fiercely fought Modi, Modi's tsunami was missing
 masalan orissa, pashchim bengal, tamilnadu or telugana
 Even the Congress did not perform so poorly in a state like Punjab because it went ahead and fought, due to which the star leader of BJP also had to face defeat
 chauthaa, party or sarkaar ke bich bhagidaari kaa bikharana
 This partnership was very well maintained at the time of UPA-1 and for some time in UPA-2
 is bikharaav kii vajah se shashan puri tarah se gaayab ho gaya or aakhri do saal main to shashan puri tarah khatm ho jane kii dharna hi ban gai
 'weak' or 'indecisive leadership' was seen as the reason for this void
 is khaali jagah ko bharne ke liye modi ko 'majboot’ or 'masihaai’ netaa ke rup main dekha gaya
 The last and perhaps most important reason was that the Congress failed to publicize its success in developing and delivering effectively
 aisa laga jaise congress ke ek varg (mukhya rup se pradhanmantri se judaa hua) ne khud ko vikaas ke liye jimmedaar mana or duusare varg (mukhya rup se sonia gandhi se judaa) ne khud ko samaaj ke garib tabake ko phayda pahunchane vaala mana
 Interestingly, both were seen as denying each other success
 kuch dashak pehle tak jis vruddhi dar kii baat sochi bhi nahin ja sakati thi, bharat ko waisi vruddhi dar dilaane or garibon ko rojgaar dene kaa kaarykram, (jo duniya main garibi unmoolan ke sabase bade kaaryakramon main se ek he), chalaane ke baad bhi congress kisi ek kaa bhi shrey lene main asafal rahi
 Who would believe that it was this party that brought India into the era of globalization without compromising its universality
 saath hi garibon ke hit ko bhi bachaae rakhaa
 This task was not easy for any other country
 congress ko ab bhavishya main kya karne kii jarurat he
 First, it needs to build a strong and committed leadership
 aisa netritv jo congress kii vichaardhaara ko gaharaai se samajhataa ho or lambey samay se is koshish main laga ho
 Leaders who work half-heartedly on the advice of a non-political group and often advise the Congress to do politics of other people, cannot do good to the party
 yah gut bahusnkhyakon kii bhaawanaaon ko aahat na karne ke naam par kabhi hindutv ko badhaava dene kii salaah detaa rahaa he to kabhi vanchiton ke utthan ke naam par alpsankhyak sampradayikta or jatigat raajnneeti ko protsaahan dene kii baat karata he
 By doing this, casteist and communal people go away with other parties (mayawati, Mulayam Singh Yadav and BJP)
 is tarah kii raajnneeti kii vajah se modi ko vipareet asar kaa laabh mil jaataa he or ve desh ke sabhi nagarikon ke saath samaan aacharan kaa daawa karne lagate hai
 The Congress should recall the slogan of the era of Indira Gandhi which said, "neither on caste, nor on Pant, on Indira ji's word, stamp will be on hand
" ” congress ko apni vampanthi jhukaav vaale, puri tarah se dharmanirpeksh or samaveshi raste (jativaadee or sampradayik raajnneeti ko badhaava die bina) par kaayam rahanaa chahie
 The road that has been the hallmark of this party for over a century
 ek or zyada mahatvapurn jarurat yah he ki congress ko apane loktantric charitra ko purnsthapit karne ke liye gambhirtha se prayaas karnaa chahie, jaise 1920 main mahatma gandhi ne party kaa punargathan kiya tha or yah kaam 1960 ke dashak tak chalata rahaa
 Rajiv Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi repeatedly spoke of bringing openness to the party, making contacts at the grassroots level and bypassing 'brokers of power'
 unhone kuch chote-chote kadam bhi uthaae, lekin desh par shashan karne kii taatkaalik chintaa main ye koshishen kahin gum hokar rah gayi
 Now is a chance to make it your main issue
 hamen yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki samvidhan main 73wein or 74wein sanshodhan ke jariye congress ne jo takatein khadi kii thim, unhone panchayat raaj sansthaaon ke vibhinn staron par tees lakh chune hue pratinidhiyon kii sena khadi kar di he
 To strengthen our democracy, this energy has to be used at the ground level
 congress ko ek baar phir se sadsyta badhaane kaa vyapak abhiyaan chalaanaa chahie or apane sadasyon ko gaanv se lekar taluka, jila, praant or rashtriya str tak padaadhikari chunane kaa mauka dena chahie
 It should also include the AICC, Executive Committee and election of party president
 congress ke bade se bade netaa jaise jawaharlal nehru or subhash chandra bose ko bhi vibhinn padon ke liye chunaav kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha or kabhi-kabhi to kadi takkar bhi jhelni padi thi
 This work will face some practical problems like fake membership, but the Congress will have to face these challenges
 use je
 M
 lingadoh jaise diggajon kaa sahyog lekar party main svachh chunaav karana chahie
 This is not a major problem in today's time
 congress agar is kaam main safal rahati he to desh main ek baar phir yah akeli party hogi, jisamen aantarik loktantr hoga
 This can become an example for other parties in the country
 congress agar aisa kar paati he to vah vanshavaad kii raajnneeti karne, vanchiton ke liye darwaja band hone, janata se dur ho jane or chatukaaron ko mauka milane jaisi tamaam aalochanaon se batch sakegi
 The Congress once again needs to present itself as a party with purpose and a definite vision, not a party that is just as hungry for power as it is becoming day by day
 is koshish main party ko puri vinamrata ke saath kaam karnaa or puure man se badi sankhya main un vyaktiyon, samoohon or sanghathanon ko samarthan dena hoga, jo bharat ke bare main iske diggaj netaaon ke vyakt kiye gaye vichaaron se ittefaq rakhte hai

 The tug of war over the seat-sharing between the Janata Dal (U) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Bihar over the upcoming Lok Sabha elections may be over within a month
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kaha he ki unke or bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ke bich pichley hafte hui baithak ke baad bijepi kii taraf se agle teen-chaar hafte main prastaav aayega
 Significantly, on Thursday, the BJP national president Amit Shah and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar met twice
 jisamen siton ke talmail ko lekar lambii charchaa hui thi
 Now Chief Minister Nitish Kumar says that in the next few weeks, there will be a proposal from the BJP regarding seats
 jise lekar baaten spasht taur par janata ke saamne aaengi
 BJP can give equal status to JD (U), although discussion in political corridors is in full swing that what will BJP offer? Before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, there are speculations about the JD (U) having the status of elder brother, that the BJP can give equal status to the JD (U)
 kyonki bijepi ko maaloom he ki jedy(you ) akele chunaav bhale hi na jeet paye lekin nitish kumaar kaa cheharaa hone se gathbandhan par kaaphi fark padegaa
 This fact has also been proved in the 2015 assembly elections
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki bijepi or jedy(you) 16-16 siton par chunaav lard sakate hai
 While in the remaining seats, the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) of Ram Vilas Paswan and Upendra Kushwaha's party on 2 seats were contested
 ghatak dalon ko milegi sammanjanak pojishnakayaas yah bhi lagaae ja rahe hai ki bijepi 19 siton par chunaav lard sakati he jabaki jedy(you) ko 13 siten mili
 This will be possible when both parties agree that JD (U) will get more seats in the assembly elections
 maujuuda loksabhaa main jedy(you) ke paas maatr 2 site hai
 He has 22 BJP mps from Bihar
 mana ja rahaa he ki bijepi kii taraf se jediu ke liye koi sammanjanak prastaav hi aayegaa
 Because Amit Shah had said in his speech on Thursday that we know how to take care of the constituents involved in our alliance
 bada bhai-chota bhai par raar khatm !ab bijepi, nitish kumaar kaa kitna khyaal rakhti he sabaki najar isi par he
 However, after the meeting between JD (U) national president and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and BJP national president Amit Shah on Thursday, the rhetoric between the leaders of both parties has completely stopped
 yahaan tak ki ye vivaad bhi khatm ho gaya he ki bada bhai koun rahegaa or chota bhai koun? ab intjaar he ki bijepi apni taraf se jediu ke liye kya prastaav laati he? Three days later, it is Republic Day and there is an alert for terrorists all over the country
 lekin aatankwaadi sanghathan bhi chupchaap nahin baithe hai
 They are engaged in their nefarious plot to mislead the youth of the country
 or ab to ye aatankwaadi naujavaanon ko gumraah karne ke liye baqayada unke mobile par massej bhej rahe hai
 This new conspiracy of terrorists was revealed from Noida, where a young man reached a police complaint after receiving a similar message
 darj shikaayat ke anusaar, noujvaan ke mobile par massej aayaa ki osama bin laden ke aatanki sanghathan ke saath jud jaao
 The message further reads, "osama bin Laden Khudai
 jihad ke liye aatanki ban jaao
 "after the complaint is filed, the police suspect that such a message is being sent to so many youth of the country
 noida ke rahane vaale shailendra sharma ke paas 10 janvari se hi lagaataar is tarah ke massej aa rahe hai
 At first, Shailendra ignited the message, but the message kept on coming
 lekin 26 janvari ke maddenjar aatankwaadi hamale kii ashanka vaale alert ko dekhakar shailendra ne sector-24 thane main shikaayat darj karai
 The police also understood the seriousness of the case and immediately registered an FIR
 police ne khufia agenciyon ko bhi is sambandh main suchit kar diya
 In the past, there have been cases of tricking the youth of the country from ISI to join the terrorist organization through social site
 lekin bharat sarkaar ne jab jab soshal citon ke content ko lekar sakhti baratani shuru kii to ab aatankiyon ne yah nayaa tarika nikaala he desh ke nauvajavaanon ko bargalane ke liye
 Because most terrorists target those young people, who are not well educated or unemployed
 lihaaja isse inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki mobile par text massej ke jariye ye aatankwaadi desh main hi desh ke khilaaf aatanki taiyaar karne kii yojana bana rahe hon
 The police is now trying to reach out to people sending such messages to Shailendra by all means
 police is baat kii bhi jaanch karegi ki ye massej bhejne vaale kii manshaa kya he or massej bhejne vaale kaa uddeshy kya he

 But some people played a very important role in the victory of Mumbai Indians by staying behind the scenes
 is sijanriki pontingko badi ummiido ke saath mumbai indiens ne coach banaaya
 But look at the fate, as soon as you took office, you had to face defeat in 5 of the first 6 matches
 aisa lagane laga ki ponting kii pratishtha hi daanv main lag gai he
 Ricky Ponting was in the news for his aggressive captaincy while playing for Australia
 lekin aisa laga ki ipel main unki ranneetiyaan aundhe munh gir rahi hai
 But Ponting was about to give up
 ponting ne jis andaaj main team ko ek sutara main baandha wo kaabil-e-tarif he
 Initially, Ponting may have taken some time to understand the players and their skills, but once he understood everyone, the team did not look back
 yah apane aap main badi tajjub kii baat he ki ek team apane 6 main se 5 match haar jaae, sthiti aisi ban jaae ki ek match haare to toornament se baahar
 Just think what pony would have been given to Ponting by the team's players that no one had given up
 kehete hai ek coach utana hi acha hota he jitna ki unki team
 But it can also not be denied that sometimes the role of the coach also decides the fate of the team
 rohit sharmaabhi is baat ko maanate hai ki riki ponting ne unki captaini ko nikhaar diya, jisase unhen team ko lekar aage badhane main aasaani hui
 Ponting's tricks were highly profitable for Rohit and the team
 ipel jeetne ke baad ponting ne bollywood ke kisi hero ke andaaj main kaha 'maine pehle hi kaha tha, main yahaan jeetne aayaa hum
 'and perhaps this same line also mentioned the name of which book Ricky Ponting is

 is lekh ko likhane se pehle apana vot daal ke ai hum
 In the same school where i first voted in the 1977 general election to defeat Indira Gandhi
 kya chunaav tha, kya maahaul, kya dil main 'sarfaroshi kii tamanna'! sirf mere dil main nahin, sabake dil main kyonki haraana tha ek taanashaah ko jisane hamaare buniyadi adhikaar chhine the
 This time when she went to the same school, she saw that the street was packed with the cars of TV people
 thodaa aashcharya hua
 Then i remembered that the school where my polling station is is only two steps away from Rahul Gandhi's house
 
 
 unke intjaar main tha mediawaalon kaa yah majamaa
 If his grandmother was the villain of the 1977 election, then Rahul Baba has been the hero of this 2009 general election
 itane bade hero ban gaye hai ve ki rahul baba kahana ab munasib nahin
 Now, the future prime minister will have to say and probably will also have to accept that he is better than other democratic youths
 kam se kam raashtra str ke raajnneetik muddon par to baaten kar lete hai thikthak, kaam se kaam
 The basis of his politics is neither casteism nor religion
 muqabla unka kar saktaa he koi to sirf unki choti bahaniya or vah sirf isliye ki hindi bol leti he unase acchhee, or shakl-surat daadi se milti he
 In a country where the general public still believes that if someone has ruled, then only Indira Gandhi, her 'charisma' is the charm of her grand-grandchild
 yah vichaar aayaa to thodi niraashaa hui mujhe
 It is remembered that if India still counts among the poorest countries, then the blame is more on Indira Gandhi, who ruled with the help of false slogans like 'garibi Hatao'
 jinhone sahi aarthik or raajnneetik nitiyon kii jagah rakhaa apana karishma, apana parivaar
 He converted the country's oldest political party into a private company
 is chatur raajnneetik chaal kaa naam rakhaa 'kurabaani'
 The move has been so successful that rahul-priyanka still talk about the 'sacrifices' of their family
 bharat desh ko apni nijee jayjad samaj lenaa kurabaani he kya?vaise, kasoor hamaara bhi he
 We know that real progress has been made in India only in the last 15 years
 or vah pragati sambhav na hoti agar narsingh raav ke samay aarthik sudhaar na kiye gaye hote
 The country grew a bit because of these reforms as the annual growth of the economy quadrupled
 license raaj samaapt na kiya hota hamane, to apana yah behaal desh or bhi zyada behaal hota kyonki jab tak nehru-gandhi parivaar kaa raaj tha, arthvyavastha kii vaarshik vruddhi kii dar kabhi 3 pratishat se upar nahin gai
 Those who still say that only the big industrialists have benefited from the economic reforms, they have probably not understood that if private investors do not have money in the country then roads will not be built, electricity can not grow, schools and hospitals cannot become And all these things are needed by the poor, more than the rich
 amir bharatiyon ko na aavashyaktaa he sarkari bijli-pani kii, na sarkari skool-aspataal kii
 The poor get the benefit of these public services only
 aaj to sthiti yah he ki madhyavargeey bhartiya bhi nijee sevaaon ko kharidne ke kaabil he
 When it came to the middle class, i remembered that in 1977, the middle class Indians were so few that they were equal
 aaj agar 30 karod se zyada bhartiya madhyavarg main gine jate hai to unheen aarthik sudhaaron ke kaaran jinhone indira gandhi kii 'samaajawaadee' aarthik nitiyon ko palat kar rakh daalaa tha
 If we do not get anything from worshiping the nehru-gandhi family, why is the impact of this family so much even today? Why can we easily see Rahul Gandhi as the future Prime Minister of the country? This question should be answered to those opposing parties, who till date have not been able to oppose a political party which has become a private company of a family
 kya jawaab he bhartiya janata party ke paas, jo aaj sabase bada virdohi dal he? kyon nahin kar saki he vah aaj tak congress kaa muqabla? kyon nahin de saki he desh ko ek aisa netaa, jo parivaravaadi loktantr ko samaapt kar sake?kya yah satya nahin he ki agar mandir-masjid ke muddon ko chhod kar bhartiya janata party ne asli raajnneetik muddon par zyada dhyaan diya hota to yah haal na hota? aam aadmi ne apni taraf se vanshavaadi congress party kaa vikalp dhundne kii koshish kii he
 This proves that no political party has got a complete majority in the Lok Sabha since 1989
