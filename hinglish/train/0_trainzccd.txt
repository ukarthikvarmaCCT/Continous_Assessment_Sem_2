 The Governor's statement came after he was asked questions about the Trinamool Congress allegation that the Governor was acting as a 'mouthpiece of BJP' instead of working on a constitutional post

 Even soldiers who retired from the Kenyan army seven years ago are raising their salaries quite well
 kenya kii sarkaar in sab par roak nahin laga paati he

 Due to this the airline's flight service is also likely to be affected
 vahiin eendhan supplai karne vaali tel companiyaan bhi air india ko madad karne ke mood main najar nahin aa rahi hai
 In fact, in the past, other petroleum companies (omcs) including Indian Oil had stopped supplying fuel to Air India at 6 airports due to non-payment of dues
 ab indian oil ke chairman sanjeev singh ne iskaa bachaav kiya he
 At the same time, he has denied the possibility of help to Air India
 unhone kaha ki company ke paas koi cash sarplus nahin rahati he ki vah bahut adhik udhaar de sake
 Sanjeev Singh said, "we ourselves are taking loans of about 75,000 crores annually, we are pure borrowers
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki ham sarplus cash vaali company nahin hai
 To support Air India, we will need to borrow from the market
 ’’ sanjeev singh ke mutabik indian oil, air india ko 90 din ke liye udhaar detaa he lekin beete kuch samay se bakaayaa badhata chalaa gaya or 240 din tak pahunch gaya

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne madhya pradesh sanghathan main badlaav kar jabase saansad or purv kendriya mantri ko madhya pradesh chunaav prachaar samiti kaa adhyaksh banaaya he, tabhi se jyotiraditya sindhiya ne madhya pradesh khaskar bhopal main apni gatividhiyaan badha di hai
 When the other Congress leaders are camping in Bhopal, the biggest challenge in keeping Scindia from staying here and maintaining her influence by keeping a direct connect with the workers is bringing about housing
 isiilie unhone sarkari bangale ke liye sarkaar ke paas ek aavedan bhej diya he
 In this, he has argued that one has to come to Bhopal again and again for the development of his area
 madhya pradesh kaa saansad hone ke naate vah rajdhani bhopal main sarkari bangale kii paatrata rakhte hai, lekin bhaajapa iske peeche kuch or hi daleel detii he
 BJP believes that Scindia is being shunned in the Congress
 vah janata kii samasyaon ke liye nahin apni raajnneetik haisiyat bachaane ke liye bhopal main sarkari bangala maang rahe hai
 If it is not, then why is he writing a letter for accommodation on the occasion of election
 darasal, jyotiraditya sindhiya ne bhopal main sarkari awaas ko lekar is tarah kaa patr solah saal baad likhaa he
 The official bungalow that Jyotiraditya Scindia has asked for is being linked to his activism in the assembly elections
 abhi alam yah he ki bhopal main yadi kisi kaarykram main sindhya ko feeta kaatane pahunchnaa he to unako dilli se flite pakadakar bhopal pahunchnaa padataa he
 Due to Scindia's stay in Delhi, his supporters are constantly having difficulty in meeting him
 abhi yaa to sindhiya hotel main thaharte hai yaa phir unhen guest house main ruknaa padataa he
 However, the BJP is giving it a different color
 bhaajapa ke pradesh pravaktaa rahul kothaari maanate hai ki jyotiraditya sindhiya ke lagaataar congress main par katare ja rahe hai
 At first it seemed that the party had pushed Scindia ahead by replacing Digvijay Singh, but later, by giving important responsibility to Pachauri and Digvijay Singh, Scindia suffered a setback at the party level
 aise main ab jyotiraditya sindhiya ko bhi abhas hone laga he ki aane vaale samay main unako pradesh congress karyaalay main bhi baithne ko cameraa naseeb nahin hoga
 Kothari says that Scindia is the chef anyway and staying at the Nawabi Hotel has been his hobby
 sarkari bangala vaise bhi unhen kahaan raas aayega
 Other BJP leaders also believe that Scindia is staying in palaces and hotels
 vah to apane raajnneetik vajood ko kaayam rakhane ke liye isamen karyaalay kholkar samarthakon ko baithaana chaahate hai
 At the same time, Congress spokesperson Pankaj Chaturvedi says, Jyotiraditya Scindia is an MP of Guna Lok Sabha
 ek saansad ke taur par vah rajdhani main sarkari awaas hasil karne kii paatrata rakhte hai
 If many BJP leaders have got government accommodation in Bhopal, then Scindia should also get it
 isamen yadi bhaajapa ke netaaon ko aapatti he to ye unki ochhi raajnneeti he
 Whether the BJP is saying the same thing, Jyotiraditya Scindia wrote a letter to the government on May 23 for the official residence, then questions started to arise
 patr main sindhiya ne zikr kiya he ki vah guna loksabhaa kshetra se saansad hai or unhen apane kshetra ke vikaas kaaryon ke sambandh main bhopal aana padataa he
 Now the question is why he wants a house in Bhopal before the elections
 kya vah duusare congressi netaaon ke mukaable main pichad rahe hai or lagaataar unke dilli rahane par ab kya netritv bhi un par sawaal uthaane laga he
 It is also clear that if Scindia gets a government bungalow, he can prove to be the third major power center of the Congress after Congress state president Kamal Nath and former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh
 is chunaav main sindhiya kaa focus yuvaaon ko apane saath jodakar badi siyaasi lakeer khinchne par he
 The BJP state president also asked for government housing, the home department in trouble, the home department is in trouble over the demand for government housing by first BJP state president Rakesh Singh and then Congress campaign committee chairman Jyotiraditya Scindia
 sarkari bangalon ke aavanton ko lekar uske saamne badi mushkil yahi he ki vah ab koun sa bangala rakesh singh ko den or koun sa sindhiya ko! donon hi madhya pradesh se saansad hai
 There are many contenders in the queue right now

 Headley also stated that he hated India and Indians since December 1971, when his school was bombed by India during the indo-pakistan War and in which many people died
 hedli ne bataaya, 'mujhe bharat tathaa bharatiyon se saat disambar, 1971 ko hi nafrat ho gai thi, jab bhartiya vimaanon ne mere skool par bambaari kii thi

 If those states which do not want to implement it, 18 cities are left
 " unhone kaha ki isliye desh main keval 18 shaharon main is tarah ke stores khole ja sakate hai
 He explained about this policy that investors would have to invest at least $ 100 million, half of which would be spent on building infrastructure
 udhar, bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ne sarkaar kii is niti ko chote udyogon ke liye mrityughosh bataaya
 Leading the debate in Lok Sabha, Leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj said that FDI in multi-brand retail will prove to be a death knell for small industries
 swaraj ne kaha ki sarkaar kaa yah daawa myth he ki videshi nivesh se kisaanon, upabhoktaaon ko laabh hoga or rojgaar srijan hoga
 Swaraj said, "the government has reversed its promise to consult with all constituents before allowing FDI in retail
 " The BJP leader said, "international experiences show that retail traders adopt robbery policy in pricing and they reduce prices so that other shops are closed and when the entire market is over they will raise prices and in such a situation consumers There will be no option left except to shop at high prices
 " Sushma rejected the government's argument that foreign investment would end the role of middleman
 unhone kaha, "khudara main epadiai se bichauliya samskruti samaapt nahin hogi
 There are also examples such as sugar industry, where there is no middleman, yet farmers have to struggle for cane pricing
 " Rejecting the government's claim that FDI will increase employment, Sushma said, "the government says that FDI will provide employment to 40 lakh people
 lekin in aankadon par gaur karen to yadi hamen itani badi sankhya main logon ko rojgaar dena he to wallmart, tesco or bharat aane vaali anya companiyon ko 53 shaharon main 36,000 se adhik store kholane kii jarurat padegi
 And this means that each city will have more than 600 stores
 " Swaraj said, "the government says that foreign companies will have to take 30 percent of the products from Indian small and medium enterprises, i
e
 70 percent of the products will be imported
 kya koi udyog 30 pratishat utpaadan par tik saktaa he? or 90 pratishat aaayaatit saamaan china se aayega or isse china main rojgaar or vikaas hoga, bharat main nahin

 Chhetri did not play in this match due to injury
 unki kami bharat ko is match main khalati hui dikhi
 In his place, goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh was made the captain, who performed both his responsibilities well, but luckily lost some place
 match kii shuruyaat hi bharat ke liye buree rahi
 Jordan got a penalty in the eighth minute
 bhartiya dephender ne jordan ke al baakhit ko penalty aria main gira diya or referi ne turant mejabaan team ko penalty di, lekin gurprit ne jordan ko khush nahin hone diya
 Bani Atiha took a penalty and tried to put the ball in the left corner, which the Indian goalkeeper stopped and disappointed the hosts
 haalanki gurprit kii halki si laaparvaahee hi jordan ko badhat dilaane vaali sabit hui
 The india-australia goalkeeper and captain Amer Safi, who fought in the kohli-johnson battle, got a chance to take a kick
 unhone dekha ki gurprit goalpost ke kaaphi dur hai
 He kicked with all his strength and the ball went into the net over Gurpreet's head with a bounce and thus the hosts were ahead by one goal in the 25th minute
 31wein minute main baakhit ke paas gol karne kaa ek or mauka tha, jise preetam kotaal ne roak liya
 India, however, did not get frustrated after eating the goal and was constantly trying

 World Championship: Boxer Sonia Lather reached the pre-quarter-finals in the 59th minute when India got a corner on which she could not score a goal and it was here that Jordan hit the counter
 gend bhartiya khilaadi samir ke paas se ehsaan hadaad ke paas ai jo gend ko lekar aage bade or gurprit ko maat dete hue apni team kaa doosraa gol kar le gaye
 Three minutes later Neishu Kumar opened India's account, raising her hopes of a comeback
 59wein minute main jaikichand singh ke sthaan par maidan par aae nishu ke paas germanpreet singh ne gend pahunchaai
 Neeshu only had to punch the goalkeeper, which he easily dropped the ball over his leg
 score abhi bhi jordan ke paksh main 2-1 tha
 Match time was running out and in the last moments both teams made some changes
 84wein minute main jordan ke ayed ne mauka banaaya jise gurprit ne mukammal nahin hone diya
 India got a corner in the 90th minute and had a chance to equalize, but due to a bad kick and no player on the spot, the opportunity was also missed

 After this, the makers made it clear in the last week of January that Girraj Singh Lotwara, the leader of Rajput Sabha, wrote that there is no such scene in the film
 in chitthiyon ke public main aane par bhansaali production kii siio shobhaa sant ne twit kiya- hamane likhit main safai de di thi
 Now Sanjay Leela Bhansali complete his film or keep on cleaning every morning on the new version? We had clarified in writing

 So can we at least finish the film in peace?@filmpadmavatihttps: / / t
 co / lq4z2hs32d — Shobha Sant (@shobhaiyersant) November 11, 2017 Anyone can watch the film after getting a certificate from the censor board: Some people are demanding to watch it before its release, accusing the film of tampering with history
 unki is maang par 'padmavati' ke mekars kaa kahana he ki sensor board se certificate milane ke baad wo film ko kisi ko bhi dikhaane ke liye taiyaar hai
 Ajit Andhare, chief operating officer of Viacom18 Motion Pictures, said in an email interview to INS - "we are showing CBFC as per the rules of the film industry
" ek baar sensor board se certificate mil jaae, uske baad jo bhi film ko dekhnaa chaahe, ham dikhaa denge
 Viacom18 Motion Pictures is also producing Padmini and Raja Ratan's love story 'padmavati' with deepika-shahid's romance Bhansali Productions
 film ko lekar vivaad bahut din se chal rahaa he
 Many political parties, including BJP and Congress, say that history has been distorted in the film
 kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki sensor board ko film ko paas nahin karnaa chahie
 Some people want that the release date of the film should be extended in view of Gujarat elections
 vahiin kuch log chaahate hai ki relies se pehle film itihaskaaron ko dikhaanaa chahie
 The Rajasthan government is also planning to create a committee to watch the film
 18 saal se padmavati banane kii koshish kar rahe the bhansaali, ye thi star castfilm ko kab milegaa certificate:andhaare ne kaha- ham chaahate hai ki sibiefasi jald film ko dekhakar certificate de de
 We do not intend to change the release date yet
 film main kuch bhi vivaadit nahin dikhaaya gaya he
 Sanjay Leela Bhansali himself released the video and said that there is no love sequence between Rani Padmavati and Alauddin Khilji in the film
 andhaare ne aage kaha- saare distributors hamaare saath hai
 There is nothing in the film that people need to worry about
 film ke relies hone ke baad rajasthan ko is film par garv hoga
 Bhansali's clarification - The film does not have a dream sequence between Rani Padmavati and Khilji
 We are confident of CBFC and its chairman (prasoon Joshi) that the film will be released on time
 ise logon kaa puraa saport mili or log ise pyaar karen

 In such a situation, the party is worried that the one who did not give the ticket, can get into the rebellion and harm the party itself

 apane daawey ko aage badhaate hue china ne kaha he ki bharat ne uski jameen main dakhal diya he
 In addition, China has now released a map showing the deadlocked area

 The map claims that the Indian fighter crossed the border at Dokala Pass

 For the last 4 days, there is tension on the border of China adjacent to the northeastern state of Sikkim

 Since the border line is not completely clear in this area, there is no clear basis of boundary

 Obviously, our knowledgeable on such incidents of late days brings out such mysterious stories against which arguments do not work
 aaie, sachin ke nazariye se jaraa halaat ko dekhen
 i do not mean that we should sit down to write Murcia, but sympathy is made with Sachin
 jis shaks ko bharat ratna kaa vaada kiya gaya ho, uske liye rajyasabha kii sadsyta kaaphi halkaa vikalp he
 Some consolation prizes comfort you, some chalk up the heart
 aakhir sachin ne yah sammaan nahin maanga tha
 It is the habit of the leaders of Delhi that they fly away with anything, it was he who struck the melody of Bharat Ratna on Sachin's 99th international century

 "if Sachin had scored his hundredth century against England at Lord's or against Australia in Sydney without any life, it would have been impossible for him to return the Bharat Ratna wave
" lekin kharama-kharama bangladesh pahunch kar latak-latak kar shatak bananaa, vah bhi aise match main jisamen bharat haar jaae, shandaar baat nahin he
 On his return to the country, Sachin was not riding a wave of victory, he did not feel honored to win any war
 aisa laga, jaise ve kisi tattu kii sawari karte hue bangladesh se laute hon
 When Sachin won the Everest, the day had reached the summit and a fog enveloped the foothills
 desh bhar main vaahvahee kii bajaae thitholi kaa maahaul tha
 Sachin opened his eyes
 jin logon ne hallaa machaaya tha, unki bheed chant gai or ve peeche chhod gaye mahaj ek shukriya kaa bhav
 Apparently, the membership of Parliament got Sachin in focus, but depends on the state of excitement or depression
 yah is par nirbhar karata he ki aapane shuruyaat kahaan se kii thi
 Apart from this, Sachin also had to see practical things

 i do not know how the income of IPL is extracted, that too when there is a different amount of money to be included in the special people's gathering or not! If Parliament understood this at all, it would not hold its session during IPL, at least if it wanted Sachin Tendulkar to take oath during this period
 aap kitna bhi khed jataaen, aapako ek saath donon chizon kaa sukh nahin mil saktaa
 However, just answer this question yourself, where would you be on May 13 on the 60th anniversary of the Indian Parliament? With Lalu Prasad Yadav amidst tired worn-out jokes or in the stands to watch David Hussey's assault? While both events were being broadcast live and free? Which do you choose? If mps want an answer, they should sell advertising slots on Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha TV
 sachin ke balle kaa ek spot steel athurity dwaara exclusive tareeke se pryojit pradhanmantri ke abhibhaashan se kahin zyada mahangaa bikega
 Then why should Sachin be blamed if he chose to go to Bangalore in Kingfisher by refusing to travel to Delhi with borrowed planes? Parliamentary purists are frustrated that Sachin did not come to the central chamber of Parliament to drink sweet toast and a handful of savory coffee 
 lekin kisi ne bhi ek buniyadi sawaal kaa jawaab nahin diyah aakhir jaldi kya he? aisa to nahin ki unke shapath grahan kii koi antim taarikh mukarrar he
 Nor has Sachin been willing to give a strong speech on the imminent destruction of the telecom industry, to shake this country or wake up the government
 khubasurat or sudaul rekha cricket nahin kheltin, itnaa to ham sab jaanate hai
 Despite this, he took three weeks to read some words in front of Hamid Ansari
 main is shararthbhari baat se bilkul sahamat nahin ki unhone isliye deree kii taaki kisi kaa saamana karne se bachaa ja sake
 There was no need to worry about the words that were spoken at the oath: Hamid Ansari would have got the job done by simply saying Umrao Jaan
 rekha kii shakhsiyat kaaphi badi he, lekin kya aapako jaraa bhi andaja he ki ek badi shakhsiyat ko yah tay karne main kitna vakt lagata hoga ki apni jindagi ke sabase bade maukey par vah kya pehnegi? jaraa dil se sochie
 And if you can't do this much for the savory line, then you don't have a heart

 rafel vimaan saude par mache bavaal ke bich centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne buudhvaar ko rajyasabha main kaig report ko pesh kiya
 The CAG report claimed that the Modi government has confirmed the deal, a total of 2 from the UPA deal
 86 fisadi sasti he
 Apart from this, some other aspects have also been taken into consideration in the CAG report
 jaise 2007 or 2015 kii deal kii tulana kii gai, jisamen ye samajhaayaa gaya he
 There is a great difference between the old and the new deal
 rajyasabha main pesh CAG report ke pej number 130 par is bare main vistaar se bataaya gaya he
 - The price quoted for the Rafale deal and the price fixed by the Indian Negotiating Team (INT) in 2015, 1
 23 fisadi sasta tha
 But when the deal was signed in 2016, the price was reduced further, making the total price of the deal 2
 86 fisadi kam hui
 - The difference between the stated price and the fixed price is also because INT had made some changes in the number of aircraft
 deal tay karte hue kuch ophers kaa bhi dhyaan rakhaa gaya, jo pehle bhi bataae gaye the
 - 6 packages have been taken in the deal the NDA government has done on Rafael
 jisamen fli awe aircraft package, mentanence package, indian spacific inhansment, hathiyaaron kaa package, saath milane vaali sarvice or semulator package shaamil tha
 These 6 packages included a total of 14 items
 (photo- CAG report pej number 130 kaa screen shot)- jab in 14 vasteen ke daam par najar daalate hai, to inamen se 7 chizon ke daam zyada the, teen ke pichhali deal ke baraabar or chaar chijen saste main tay huin
 Apart from this, the price of its element cannot be compared because there was a huge difference in the offers of 2007 and 2015
 yahaan padhein
 
 
 CAG report: Rafael deal cheaper than UPA, Modi government's claim of 9% rejected- According to the report, there was a difference in price and design in the 2007 and 2016 deals
 2007 ke ofer ke anusaar, jo rafel aane vaala tha pehle usamen 18 aircraft ke liye 8 ingine + spanners the, lekin baad main 36 aircraft main 16 ingine par spair kaa total hua, jabaki jo contractadprice he vah 12 ingine + spanners kaa he
 (photo-screen shot of CAG report page no
 130) - Here the report states that since DRDO was developing some things in India itself
 isliye kuch chizon ke daam kam ho gaye
 Apart from this, some things have been increased in the aircraft space, engine spares, while things have decreased in Avinoix spares
 - isi ke aadhaar par report main likhaa gaya he ki nai deal se puraani deal kii tulana main 17
 08 percent of the money saved on planes
 CAG report kii das badi baaten yahaan padhein

 Sources in the Ministry of Defense said on Friday that the court martial proceedings against Lt Gen PK Rath, a former commander of the 33rd Corps, would begin on 30 August
 unhen pashchim bengal main sukna sthit sainya centre ke paas 70 acre bhoomi par shaikshanik santhaan sthapit karne ke liye ek nijee rielter ko anaapatti pramaan patr jari karne main bhoomika ko lekar court marshall kii kaarywahi kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 He said that orders have already been issued to initiate a court martial against Lt General Rath in the Summary of Evidence (SOE) after he recommended that disciplinary proceedings be continued
 unhone kaha ki court marshall kii adhyakshata rath se varisht teen star vaale adhikari karenge
 The army has accused Rath of issuing a no-objection certificate with the intention of cheating a private realtor into a Rs 300 crore land scam
 pichley saal kii gai court aaf inquairi main sena ne kathith bhoomi ghotaale main rath ko aropit kiya tha or raksha mantralay ne dipti chif of army staff ke taur par unki niyukti ko radd kar diya tha

 com / 02v60lntgc 5 karod rupee ke jurmaane ke saaye main dilli main yamuna tire 11 march se 13 march ke bich shri shri ravishankar ke vishwa saanskriti samaaroh ko anumati mil gai he
 The event has got legal sanction but a fine of Rs 5 crore does not question its ethics
 un vibhaagon ko jurmaana bharne kaa aadesh kya halkaa nahin he
 Departments will pay the fine only with public money
 yamuna ke kinare samskritiyon kaa mahasangam to hoga lekin kya usamen yamuna bhi shaamil hogi
 In the emotional discussion of rivers as mother, aunt is the loss of rivers
 aisa lagata he ki kasuurvaar wo aavedak he jo aayojan ke kilaaf tribunel tak deree se pahunchaa or bekasoor wo sabhi hai jinke paas jurmaane ke taur 5 karod dene kii koi kami nahin he
 The National Green Tribunal, in its order, has said that the applicant was late in coming to the tribunal and the damages to the Yamuna could be repaid, hence the request of the applicant could not be accepted that the program should be stopped or else Construction materials should be removed
 tribunel ne kaha ki aavedak ne 11 disambar ko dilli ke leftinent governor ko is silsile main likhaa tha lekin court main yachika unhone aath farvari ko hi di or is dauraan yamuna ke khadar main nirmaan kaa kaafii kaam ho chukaa tha
 The applicant did not challenge the dda's approval on 20 June 2015, nor did the other departments' accounts state that their approval was not needed for the program
 tribunel ne ye bhi kaha ki ham dilli pradooshan control cameti kii us daleel se bhi sahamat nahin hai jisamen kaha gaya ki unhen is kaarykram ke liye ijazat dene yaa naa dene kii zarurat nahin he
 In this case DPCC has failed to fulfill its responsibility and hence a fine of Rs one lakh is imposed on it
 tribunel ke aadesh ke mutabik aayojakon ne police, damakal, jal sansaadhan or nadi vikaas mantralay se ijazat maangi thi lekin kahin se nahin mili
 Whereas according to the notification dated 31 July 2014, the Ministry of Water Resources is responsible for the conservation, development, management and pollution control of the Yamuna River
 kul milakar ye sabhi vibhaag apni zimmedaari nibhaane main naakaam rahe hai
 The order also said that the organizers did not say how large a scale is happening
 zamin ko samtal karne kaa kaam, sadaken, pontun brij, ramp, parking spes kaa kaam bade paimaane par ho rahaa he
 Stage is being built 40 feet high, 1000 feet long and 200 feet wide
 ye sab aayojak ke kilaaf jaataa he or iske liye use muawza chukaana hoga
 The court also does not agree with the plea of the Ministry of Forest and Environment that its department does not need approval while according to a 2006 notification, any work in more than 50 hectares area requires the approval of the Ministry of Forest and Environment
 tribunel ke mutabik visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki yamuna ke flud plane ke saath bade paimaane par chhedchhad kii gai he, uske prakritik bahaav par asar daalaa gaya he
 Natural vegetation such as grasses, reeds have been affected on the banks of the Yamuna, living creatures have been affected in the water, and water bodies around the Yamuna have been damaged
 aadesh main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki jal sansaadhan mantralay kii ijazat ke bagaiyr ramp, road, pontun brij bana die gaye or asthaayee nirmaan kar diya gaya
 Apart from this, the permission sought from the Delhi government has no meaning because it is not able to give permission in this regard
 paryaavaran, paristhitiki, nadi ke jeev jantuon ko hue nuksaan ke liye aayojak zimmedaar hai or paryaavaran ko is nuksaan ke muaavze ke taur par un par shuru main paanch karod kaa jurmaana lagaaya jaataa he
 The organizers must pay this amount before the event
 ye rakam baad main nuksaan ke aadhaar par tay hone vaale muaavze kii antim rakam main edjust kii jaaegi
 Departments from Delhi Government to Central Government continued to help together
 ab kendriya mantri se lekar mukhyamantri tak sab khush hai ki bharat kaa prachaar hoga kyonki shri shri ravishankar bharat ke brands ambesader hai
 According to the verdict, the Art of Living has been fined five crores, Delhi Development Authority or DDA for five lakh rupees
 dilli pradooshan control board par ek lakh rupye kaa jurmaana kiya gaya he
 Now only the way of Supreme Court is left
 art of living kaa kahana he ki is faisle ke khilaaf apil main jaaegi kyonki usne apni taraf se niyamon kaa ulanghan nahin kiya he
 Will government departments also go
 faisalaa sunaane se pehle neshnal green tribunel ne van or paryaavaran mantralay kii khinchaai kii kyonki usne mangalvaar ko maanga gaya halafanama nahin saunpa tha
 The National Green Tribunal said, "please take clear instructions from the ministry whether permission is needed to construct a temporary bridge over the Yamuna
" paryaavaran mantralay ne baad main apane efidavit main kaha ki yamuna ke basin main asthaayee dhaanchon ke nirmaan ke liye paryaavaran se judi koi manzuri nahin chahie
 However, in another affidavit to the NGT earlier, the Ministry of Environment had said that any construction in the basin of Yamuna is illegal
 yani is maamle par paryaavaran mantralay kaa koi ek stand nahin dikhaa jabaki paryaavaran mantralay kii is maamle main badi jimmedaari banati he
 When we went to the site of the Ministry of Environment, we found a department there National River Conservation Directorate
 is vibhaag kii zimmedaari he desh main nadiyon, unamem rahane vaale jeev jantuon, jhiilon, or wetelends ke sangrakshan kaa kaam karnaa
 For this it is the responsibility of implementing Central Government schemes such as National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) and National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Eco-systems (NPCA)
 saafe he yamuna kinare is aayojan ke dauraan is vibhaag kii bhoomika kahin spasht dikhaai nahin di
 The reception committee's list of this event should be seen
 supreme court ke purv justise aar si lahoti, sanyukt raashtra sangh ke purv secretary general butaras butaras ghaali ji, netherland ke purv pradhanmantri, bharat ke purv up pradhanmantri laal krishna adwani, rajyasabha main congress saansad doctor karn singh, kendriya samskruti mantri mahesh sharma, dilli sarkaar ke samskruti mantri kapil mishra kaa naam aapako kai videshi saansadon or hastiyon ke bich milegaa
 NGT also asked the Ministry of Water Resources if they have any role in this matter, then the Ministry has clearly said that they have no role
 or ye baat sansad ke baahar jal sansaadhan mantri uma bharti ne khud bhi kahi
 Now the question is, how can a ministry that has the responsibility of maintaining the country's rivers and its flood basin make such a statement
 ham jal sansaadhan mantralay kii website par gaye
 There is a complete department called Upper Yamuna River Board which comes under this ministry
 is board main central water kamishan ke alaava uttar pradesh, uttarakhand, haryana, rajasthan, himachal pradesh or dilli ke sadsy hote hai
 This board, made to ensure minimum flow of water in Yamuna, has many other responsibilities
 inamen yamuna ke khadar main zamin ke upar or zamin ke andar pani kii gunvattta ko behatar karnaa, yamuna basin main pani ke bahaav ke aankadon ko jamaa karnaa, dilli main okhla bairaj tak sabhi projects kii nigaraanee or samiksha shaamil he
 It is clear that this department of the ministry also did not play any clear role
 yahi nahin is aayojan se pehle paryaavaran par padane vaale asar kaa koi adhyayan nahin kiya gaya
 According to the Indian Express, last year, the NGT had given an order prohibiting any kind of construction along the banks of the Yamuna
 aap jaanate hai ki yamuna ko bachaane ko lekar mathura se ek bada andolan samay samay par dilli aata rahata he
 The comments pichley saal march ke maheene main hi mathura yamuna muktikaran padayatra dilli ke liye ai thi
 At Jantar Mantar, its members also went on a fast-unto-death
 inaki maang he ki yamuna main pani kaa bahaav aviral or nirmal ho
 Uma Bharti had met them and assured them, but now the organizers say that nothing happened in a year
 mathura ke kai sampradaayon ke log khaskar ballabhapur sampradaay ke maananevaale yamuna bachaao braj bachaao kaa abhiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 He also took out a march in 2013 during the UPA but nothing happened
 tab sansad main is march ke bahaane bijepi ke netaaon ne zordaar bhaashan diye the
 When the NDA government came, they thought that a lot will happen, but it is still waiting
 21 saal se supreme court kii nigaraanee main yamuna ji ko saaf karne kaa abhiyaan chal rahaa he
 nothing happen
 pehle vahaan akshardham mandir banane ko lekar vivaad hua magar baad main sab sahi ho gaya
 Then there was a dispute about Khelgaon during the Commonwealth game, which later became correct
 ditisi bas depo ko lekar bhi vivaad ho gaya
 All disputes have good luck
 baad main ve sahi ho jate hai
 If this is the case of Yamuna ji, then she is not right
 philhal yamuna ko chhodiye, bharat ke brands ambesader ke kaarykram dekhiye
 Do not worry about the fine neshnal green tribunel ne apane aadesh main kaha he ki aavedak ne tribunel main aane main der kii or yamuna ko hone vaale nuksaan kii bharpai kii ja sakati he isliye aavedak kii ye prarthana sweekaar nahin kii ja sakati ki is kaarykram par roak laga di jaae yaa phir nirmaan saamagree ko hatwa diya jaae
 The tribunal said that the applicant had written to the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi in this regard on December 11, but he filed a petition in the court only on February 8, and during this time a lot of construction work was done in the Khadar of Yamuna
 aavedak ne 20 june 2015 ko didie kii ore se di gai ijazat ko bhi chalange nahin kiya naa hi baaki vibhaagon ke un khaton ko jinamein kaha gaya ki kaarykram ke liye unki manzuri kii zarurat nahin he
 The tribunal also said that we do not agree with the Delhi Pollution Control Committee's plea that they do not have to approve or give permission for this program
 is maamle main dipisisi apni zimmedaari nibhaane main naakaam rahaa he isliye us par ek lakh rupee kaa jurmaana lagaaya jaataa he
 According to the tribunal's order, the organizers had sought permission from the police, fire brigade, water resources and river development ministry but could not be obtained from anywhere
 jabaki 31 july 2014 ke notification ke mutabik jal sansaadhan mantralay yamuna nadi ke sangrakshan, vikaas, prabandhan or pradooshan niyantran ke liye zimmedaar he
 All these departments have failed to fulfill their responsibilities
 aadesh main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki aayojakon ne yah nahin bataaya ki kitne bade paimaane par ho rahaa he
 Land leveling, roads, pontoon bridges, ramps, parking spaces are being done on a large scale
 40 feet ooncha, 1000 feet lanbaa or 200 feet chaudaa stage banaaya ja rahaa he
 All this goes against the organizer and he will have to pay compensation for it
 adaalat van or paryaavaran mantralay kii us daleel se bhi sahamat nahin he ki uske vibhaag kii manzuri kii zarurat nahin he jabaki 2006 ke ek notification ke mutabik 50 hectare se zyaada ilaake main kisi bhi kaam ke liye van or paryaavaran mantralay kii manzuri kii zarurat he
 According to the tribunal, experts believe that the Yamuna's floodplain has been tampered with extensively, affecting its natural drift
 yamuna kinare prakritik vanaspati jaise ghaas, sarkandon par asar padaa he, pani main rahane vaale jeev jantu prabhavit hue hai or yamuna ke aasapaas kii water bodies ko nuksaan hua he
 The order also stated that without the permission of the Ministry of Water Resources, the ramp, road, pontoon bridge were built and temporary construction was done
 iske alaava dilli sarkaar se jo ijazat maangi gai uskaa koi matlab nahin he kyonki is bare main ijazat dene ke liye wo sakasham nahin he
 Organizers are responsible for the damage caused to the environment, ecology, river fauna and they are initially fined five crores as compensation for the damage to the environment
 aayojakon ko kaarykram hone se pehle hi ye rakam chukaani hogi
 These amounts will later be adjusted to the final amount of compensation to be decided on the basis of loss
 dilli sarkaar se lekar centre sarkaar ke vibhaag milakar madad karte rahe
 Now everyone from the Union Minister to the Chief Minister is happy that India will be promoted because Sri Sri Ravi Shankar is the Brand Ambassador of India
 faisle ke mutabik art of living ko paanch karod, Delhi Development Authority yani didie par paanch lakh rupye kaa jurmaana laga he
 Delhi Pollution Control Board has been fined one lakh rupees
 ab supreme court kaa hi rasta bachaa he
 The Art of Living says it will go against the decision in appeal because it has not violated the rules on its behalf
 kya sarkari vibhaag bhi jaaenge
 The National Green Tribunal pulled up the Ministry of Forest and Environment before hearing the decision as it had not submitted the affidavit sought on Tuesday
 neshnal green tribunel ne kaha mantralay se saafe nirdesh lekar aaie ki kya yamuna par asthaayee pul banane ke liye ijazat kii zarurat he
 The environment ministry later stated in its affidavit that no environmental clearance is required for the construction of temporary structures in the Yamuna basin
 haalanki isse pehle NGT ko die ek or halafanaame main paryaavaran mantralay kah chukaa tha ki yamuna ke basin main kisi bhi tarah kaa nirmaan gair kanoonee he
 That is, there is no stand of the Ministry of Environment on this matter, whereas the Ministry of Environment has a big responsibility in this matter
 ham paryaavaran mantralay kii site par gaye to vahaan hamen ek vibhaag mila National River Conservation Directorate
 The responsibility of this department is to conserve the rivers, fauna, lakes and wetlands in the country
 iske liye centre sarkaar kii skiimon jaise National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) and National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Eco-systems (NPCA) ko lagu karnaa isaki zimmedaari he
 It is clear on the banks of the Yamuna that the role of this department was not clearly visible during this event
 is aayojan kii swaagat samiti kii suchi dekhni chahie
 Former Supreme Court Justice RC Lahoti, former UN Secretary General Boutras Boutras Ghali, former Prime Minister of Netherlands, former Deputy Prime Minister of India LK Advani, Congress MP in Rajya Sabha Dr Karn Singh, Union Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma, Delhi You will find the name of Kapil Mishra, the culture minister of the government, among many foreign mps and celebrities
 NGT ne jal sansaadhan mantralay se bhi poocha ki kya is maamle main unki bhi koi bhoomika he to mantralay ne saafe kah diya ki unki koi bhoomika nahin he
 And this was also said by the Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti outside the Parliament itself
 ab sawaal ye he ki jis mantralay ke paas desh kii nadiyon or uske flud basin ke rakh rakhaav kii zimmedaari ho wo aisa bayaan kaise de saktaa he
 We went to the website of the Ministry of Water Resources
 yahaan apper yamuna river board naam se puraa ek mahakama he jo is mantralay ke tahat aata he
 The board consists of members from Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi, besides the Central Water Commission
 yamuna main pani ke nunatam bahaav ko sunishchit karne ke liye bane is board kii or bhi kai zimmedaariyaan hai
 These include improving the quality of water above and below ground in Khadar of Yamuna, collecting water flow data in Yamuna basin, monitoring and reviewing all projects up to Okhla barrage in Delhi
 saafe he mantralay ke is vibhaag ne bhi apni koi spasht bhoomika nahin nibhaai
 Not only this, no study of the impact on the environment was done before this event
 indian express ke anusaar pichley saal engiti ne aadesh dekar yamuna ke kinare kisi bhi tarah ke nirmaan par roak laga di thi
 You know that a big movement from Mathura comes to Delhi from time to time to save Yamuna
 tippaniyan In the month of March last year, Mathura Yamuna Muktikaran Padyatra came for Delhi
 jantar mantar par iske sadasyon ne aamaran anshan bhi kiya tha
 They demand that the flow of water in Yamuna should be continuous and uninterrupted
 uma bharti ne inase mulaakaat kar aashwaasan bhi diya tha magar ab aayojakon kaa kahana he ki ek saal main kuch bhi nahin hua
 People of many sects of Mathura, especially those of the Ballabhpur sect, are carrying out the campaign of Yamuna Bachao Braj Bachao
 inhone upie ke samay 2013 main bhi march nikaala tha magar kuch nahin hua
 Then the BJP leaders gave loud speeches on the pretext of this march in Parliament
 endie kii sarkaar ai to inhen laga ki bahut kuch hoga magar abhi tak intazaar hi ho rahaa he
 For 21 years, a campaign to clean Yamuna ji has been going on under the supervision of the Supreme Court
 kuch nahin hua
 At first there was a dispute over the construction of the Akshardham temple, but later everything went right
 phir kaamanwealth game ke dauraan khelgaumv ko lekar vivaad hua baad main sahi ho gaya
 There was also a dispute over the DTC bus depo
 saare vivaadon kii kismat acchhee hoti he
 Later they are corrected
 rahi baat yamuna ji kii to wo sahi nahin ho paati hai
 For the moment, except Yamuna, watch the programs of India's brand ambassador
 jurmaane kii chintaa mat kiijie
 The applicant did not challenge the dda's approval on 20 June 2015, nor did the other departments' accounts state that their approval was not needed for the program
 tribunel ne ye bhi kaha ki ham dilli pradooshan control cameti kii us daleel se bhi sahamat nahin hai jisamen kaha gaya ki unhen is kaarykram ke liye ijazat dene yaa naa dene kii zarurat nahin he
 In this case DPCC has failed to fulfill its responsibility and hence a fine of Rs one lakh is imposed on it
 tribunel ke aadesh ke mutabik aayojakon ne police, damakal, jal sansaadhan or nadi vikaas mantralay se ijazat maangi thi lekin kahin se nahin mili
 Whereas according to the notification dated 31 July 2014, the Ministry of Water Resources is responsible for the conservation, development, management and pollution control of the Yamuna River
 kul milakar ye sabhi vibhaag apni zimmedaari nibhaane main naakaam rahe hai
 The order also said that the organizers did not say how large a scale is happening
 zamin ko samtal karne kaa kaam, sadaken, pontun brij, ramp, parking spes kaa kaam bade paimaane par ho rahaa he
 Stage is being built 40 feet high, 1000 feet long and 200 feet wide
 ye sab aayojak ke kilaaf jaataa he or iske liye use muawza chukaana hoga
 The court also does not agree with the plea of the Ministry of Forest and Environment that its department does not need approval while according to a 2006 notification, any work in more than 50 hectares area requires the approval of the Ministry of Forest and Environment
 tribunel ke mutabik visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki yamuna ke flud plane ke saath bade paimaane par chhedchhad kii gai he, uske prakritik bahaav par asar daalaa gaya he
 Natural vegetation such as grasses, reeds have been affected on the banks of the Yamuna, living creatures have been affected in the water, and water bodies around the Yamuna have been damaged
 aadesh main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki jal sansaadhan mantralay kii ijazat ke bagaiyr ramp, road, pontun brij bana die gaye or asthaayee nirmaan kar diya gaya
 Apart from this, the permission sought from the Delhi government has no meaning because it is not able to give permission in this regard
 paryaavaran, paristhitiki, nadi ke jeev jantuon ko hue nuksaan ke liye aayojak zimmedaar hai or paryaavaran ko is nuksaan ke muaavze ke taur par un par shuru main paanch karod kaa jurmaana lagaaya jaataa he
 The organizers must pay this amount before the event
 ye rakam baad main nuksaan ke aadhaar par tay hone vaale muaavze kii antim rakam main edjust kii jaaegi
 Departments from Delhi Government to Central Government continued to help together
 ab kendriya mantri se lekar mukhyamantri tak sab khush hai ki bharat kaa prachaar hoga kyonki shri shri ravishankar bharat ke brands ambesader hai
 According to the verdict, the Art of Living has been fined five crores, Delhi Development Authority or DDA for five lakh rupees
 dilli pradooshan control board par ek lakh rupye kaa jurmaana kiya gaya he
 Now only the way of Supreme Court is left
 art of living kaa kahana he ki is faisle ke khilaaf apil main jaaegi kyonki usne apni taraf se niyamon kaa ulanghan nahin kiya he
 Will government departments also go
 faisalaa sunaane se pehle neshnal green tribunel ne van or paryaavaran mantralay kii khinchaai kii kyonki usne mangalvaar ko maanga gaya halafanama nahin saunpa tha
 The National Green Tribunal said, "please take clear instructions from the ministry whether permission is needed to construct a temporary bridge over the Yamuna
" paryaavaran mantralay ne baad main apane efidavit main kaha ki yamuna ke basin main asthaayee dhaanchon ke nirmaan ke liye paryaavaran se judi koi manzuri nahin chahie
 However, in another affidavit to the NGT earlier, the Ministry of Environment had said that any construction in the basin of Yamuna is illegal
 yani is maamle par paryaavaran mantralay kaa koi ek stand nahin dikhaa jabaki paryaavaran mantralay kii is maamle main badi jimmedaari banati he
 When we went to the site of the Ministry of Environment, we found a department there National River Conservation Directorate
 is vibhaag kii zimmedaari he desh main nadiyon, unamem rahane vaale jeev jantuon, jhiilon, or wetelends ke sangrakshan kaa kaam karnaa
 For this it is the responsibility of implementing Central Government schemes such as National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) and National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Eco-systems (NPCA)
 saafe he yamuna kinare is aayojan ke dauraan is vibhaag kii bhoomika kahin spasht dikhaai nahin di
 The reception committee's list of this event should be seen
 supreme court ke purv justise aar si lahoti, sanyukt raashtra sangh ke purv secretary general butaras butaras ghaali ji, netherland ke purv pradhanmantri, bharat ke purv up pradhanmantri laal krishna adwani, rajyasabha main congress saansad doctor karn singh, kendriya samskruti mantri mahesh sharma, dilli sarkaar ke samskruti mantri kapil mishra kaa naam aapako kai videshi saansadon or hastiyon ke bich milegaa
 NGT also asked the Ministry of Water Resources if they have any role in this matter, then the Ministry has clearly said that they have no role
 or ye baat sansad ke baahar jal sansaadhan mantri uma bharti ne khud bhi kahi
 Now the question is, how can a ministry that has the responsibility of maintaining the country's rivers and its flood basin make such a statement
 ham jal sansaadhan mantralay kii website par gaye
 There is a complete department called Upper Yamuna River Board which comes under this ministry
 is board main central water kamishan ke alaava uttar pradesh, uttarakhand, haryana, rajasthan, himachal pradesh or dilli ke sadsy hote hai
 This board, made to ensure minimum flow of water in Yamuna, has many other responsibilities
 inamen yamuna ke khadar main zamin ke upar or zamin ke andar pani kii gunvattta ko behatar karnaa, yamuna basin main pani ke bahaav ke aankadon ko jamaa karnaa, dilli main okhla bairaj tak sabhi projects kii nigaraanee or samiksha shaamil he
 It is clear that this department of the ministry also did not play any clear role
 yahi nahin is aayojan se pehle paryaavaran par padane vaale asar kaa koi adhyayan nahin kiya gaya
 According to the Indian Express, last year, the NGT had given an order prohibiting any kind of construction along the banks of the Yamuna
 aap jaanate hai ki yamuna ko bachaane ko lekar mathura se ek bada andolan samay samay par dilli aata rahata he
 The comments pichley saal march ke maheene main hi mathura yamuna muktikaran padayatra dilli ke liye ai thi
 At Jantar Mantar, its members also went on a fast-unto-death
 inaki maang he ki yamuna main pani kaa bahaav aviral or nirmal ho
 Uma Bharti had met them and assured them, but now the organizers say that nothing happened in a year
 mathura ke kai sampradaayon ke log khaskar ballabhapur sampradaay ke maananevaale yamuna bachaao braj bachaao kaa abhiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 He also took out a march in 2013 during the UPA but nothing happened
 tab sansad main is march ke bahaane bijepi ke netaaon ne zordaar bhaashan diye the
 When the NDA government came, they thought that a lot will happen, but it is still waiting
 21 saal se supreme court kii nigaraanee main yamuna ji ko saaf karne kaa abhiyaan chal rahaa he
 nothing happen
 pehle vahaan akshardham mandir banane ko lekar vivaad hua magar baad main sab sahi ho gaya
 Then there was a dispute about Khelgaon during the Commonwealth game, which later became correct
 ditisi bas depo ko lekar bhi vivaad ho gaya
 All disputes have good luck
 baad main ve sahi ho jate hai

 Uma Bharti had met them and assured them, but now the organizers say that nothing happened in a year
 mathura ke kai sampradaayon ke log khaskar ballabhapur sampradaay ke maananevaale yamuna bachaao braj bachaao kaa abhiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 He also took out a march in 2013 during the UPA but nothing happened
 tab sansad main is march ke bahaane bijepi ke netaaon ne zordaar bhaashan diye the
 When the NDA government came, they thought that a lot will happen, but it is still waiting
 21 saal se supreme court kii nigaraanee main yamuna ji ko saaf karne kaa abhiyaan chal rahaa he
 nothing happen
 pehle vahaan akshardham mandir banane ko lekar vivaad hua magar baad main sab sahi ho gaya
 Then there was a dispute about Khelgaon during the Commonwealth game, which later became correct
 ditisi bas depo ko lekar bhi vivaad ho gaya
 All disputes have good luck
 baad main ve sahi ho jate hai
 If this is the case of Yamuna ji, then she is not right
 philhal yamuna ko chhodiye, bharat ke brands ambesader ke kaarykram dekhiye
 Do not worry about the fine aadesh main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki aayojakon ne yah nahin bataaya ki kitne bade paimaane par ho rahaa he
 Land leveling, roads, pontoon bridges, ramps, parking spaces are being done on a large scale
 40 feet ooncha, 1000 feet lanbaa or 200 feet chaudaa stage banaaya ja rahaa he
 All this goes against the organizer and he will have to pay compensation for it
 adaalat van or paryaavaran mantralay kii us daleel se bhi sahamat nahin he ki uske vibhaag kii manzuri kii zarurat nahin he jabaki 2006 ke ek notification ke mutabik 50 hectare se zyaada ilaake main kisi bhi kaam ke liye van or paryaavaran mantralay kii manzuri kii zarurat he
 According to the tribunal, experts believe that the Yamuna's floodplain has been tampered with extensively, affecting its natural drift
 yamuna kinare prakritik vanaspati jaise ghaas, sarkandon par asar padaa he, pani main rahane vaale jeev jantu prabhavit hue hai or yamuna ke aasapaas kii water bodies ko nuksaan hua he
 The order also stated that without the permission of the Ministry of Water Resources, the ramp, road, pontoon bridge were built and temporary construction was done
 iske alaava dilli sarkaar se jo ijazat maangi gai uskaa koi matlab nahin he kyonki is bare main ijazat dene ke liye wo sakasham nahin he
 Organizers are responsible for the damage caused to the environment, ecology, river fauna and they are initially fined five crores as compensation for the damage to the environment
 aayojakon ko kaarykram hone se pehle hi ye rakam chukaani hogi
 These amounts will later be adjusted to the final amount of compensation to be decided on the basis of loss
 dilli sarkaar se lekar centre sarkaar ke vibhaag milakar madad karte rahe
 Now everyone from the Union Minister to the Chief Minister is happy that India will be promoted because Sri Sri Ravi Shankar is the Brand Ambassador of India
 faisle ke mutabik art of living ko paanch karod, Delhi Development Authority yani didie par paanch lakh rupye kaa jurmaana laga he
 Delhi Pollution Control Board has been fined one lakh rupees
 ab supreme court kaa hi rasta bachaa he
 The Art of Living says it will go against the decision in appeal because it has not violated the rules on its behalf
 kya sarkari vibhaag bhi jaaenge
 The National Green Tribunal pulled up the Ministry of Forest and Environment before hearing the decision as it had not submitted the affidavit sought on Tuesday
 neshnal green tribunel ne kaha mantralay se saafe nirdesh lekar aaie ki kya yamuna par asthaayee pul banane ke liye ijazat kii zarurat he
 The environment ministry later stated in its affidavit that no environmental clearance is required for the construction of temporary structures in the Yamuna basin
 haalanki isse pehle NGT ko die ek or halafanaame main paryaavaran mantralay kah chukaa tha ki yamuna ke basin main kisi bhi tarah kaa nirmaan gair kanoonee he
 That is, there is no stand of the Ministry of Environment on this matter, whereas the Ministry of Environment has a big responsibility in this matter
 ham paryaavaran mantralay kii site par gaye to vahaan hamen ek vibhaag mila National River Conservation Directorate
 The responsibility of this department is to conserve the rivers, fauna, lakes and wetlands in the country
 iske liye centre sarkaar kii skiimon jaise National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) and National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Eco-systems (NPCA) ko lagu karnaa isaki zimmedaari he
 It is clear on the banks of the Yamuna that the role of this department was not clearly visible during this event
 is aayojan kii swaagat samiti kii suchi dekhni chahie
 Former Supreme Court Justice RC Lahoti, former UN Secretary General Boutras Boutras Ghali, former Prime Minister of Netherlands, former Deputy Prime Minister of India LK Advani, Congress MP in Rajya Sabha Dr Karn Singh, Union Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma, Delhi You will find the name of Kapil Mishra, the culture minister of the government, among many foreign mps and celebrities
 NGT ne jal sansaadhan mantralay se bhi poocha ki kya is maamle main unki bhi koi bhoomika he to mantralay ne saafe kah diya ki unki koi bhoomika nahin he
 And this was also said by the Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti outside the Parliament itself
 ab sawaal ye he ki jis mantralay ke paas desh kii nadiyon or uske flud basin ke rakh rakhaav kii zimmedaari ho wo aisa bayaan kaise de saktaa he
 We went to the website of the Ministry of Water Resources
 yahaan apper yamuna river board naam se puraa ek mahakama he jo is mantralay ke tahat aata he
 The board consists of members from Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi, besides the Central Water Commission
 yamuna main pani ke nunatam bahaav ko sunishchit karne ke liye bane is board kii or bhi kai zimmedaariyaan hai
 These include improving the quality of water above and below ground in Khadar of Yamuna, collecting water flow data in Yamuna basin, monitoring and reviewing all projects up to Okhla barrage in Delhi
 saafe he mantralay ke is vibhaag ne bhi apni koi spasht bhoomika nahin nibhaai
 Not only this, no study of the impact on the environment was done before this event
 indian express ke anusaar pichley saal engiti ne aadesh dekar yamuna ke kinare kisi bhi tarah ke nirmaan par roak laga di thi
 You know that a big movement from Mathura comes to Delhi from time to time to save Yamuna
 tippaniyan In the month of March last year, Mathura Yamuna Muktikaran Padyatra came for Delhi
 jantar mantar par iske sadasyon ne aamaran anshan bhi kiya tha
 They demand that the flow of water in Yamuna should be continuous and uninterrupted
 uma bharti ne inase mulaakaat kar aashwaasan bhi diya tha magar ab aayojakon kaa kahana he ki ek saal main kuch bhi nahin hua
 People of many sects of Mathura, especially those of the Ballabhpur sect, are carrying out the campaign of Yamuna Bachao Braj Bachao
 inhone upie ke samay 2013 main bhi march nikaala tha magar kuch nahin hua
 Then the BJP leaders gave loud speeches on the pretext of this march in Parliament
 endie kii sarkaar ai to inhen laga ki bahut kuch hoga magar abhi tak intazaar hi ho rahaa he
 For 21 years, a campaign to clean Yamuna ji has been going on under the supervision of the Supreme Court
 kuch nahin hua
 At first there was a dispute over the construction of the Akshardham temple, but later everything went right
 phir kaamanwealth game ke dauraan khelgaumv ko lekar vivaad hua baad main sahi ho gaya
 There was also a dispute over the DTC bus depo
 saare vivaadon kii kismat acchhee hoti he
 Later they are corrected
 rahi baat yamuna ji kii to wo sahi nahin ho paati hai
 For the moment, except Yamuna, watch the programs of India's brand ambassador
 jurmaane kii chintaa mat kiijie
 The court also does not agree with the plea of the Ministry of Forest and Environment that its department does not need approval while according to a 2006 notification, any work in more than 50 hectares area requires the approval of the Ministry of Forest and Environment
 tribunel ke mutabik visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki yamuna ke flud plane ke saath bade paimaane par chhedchhad kii gai he, uske prakritik bahaav par asar daalaa gaya he
 Natural vegetation such as grasses, reeds have been affected on the banks of the Yamuna, living creatures have been affected in the water, and water bodies around the Yamuna have been damaged
 aadesh main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki jal sansaadhan mantralay kii ijazat ke bagaiyr ramp, road, pontun brij bana die gaye or asthaayee nirmaan kar diya gaya
 Apart from this, the permission sought from the Delhi government has no meaning because it is not able to give permission in this regard
 paryaavaran, paristhitiki, nadi ke jeev jantuon ko hue nuksaan ke liye aayojak zimmedaar hai or paryaavaran ko is nuksaan ke muaavze ke taur par un par shuru main paanch karod kaa jurmaana lagaaya jaataa he
 The organizers must pay this amount before the event
 ye rakam baad main nuksaan ke aadhaar par tay hone vaale muaavze kii antim rakam main edjust kii jaaegi
 Departments from Delhi Government to Central Government continued to help together
 ab kendriya mantri se lekar mukhyamantri tak sab khush hai ki bharat kaa prachaar hoga kyonki shri shri ravishankar bharat ke brands ambesader hai
 According to the verdict, the Art of Living has been fined five crores, Delhi Development Authority or DDA for five lakh rupees
 dilli pradooshan control board par ek lakh rupye kaa jurmaana kiya gaya he
 Now only the way of Supreme Court is left
 art of living kaa kahana he ki is faisle ke khilaaf apil main jaaegi kyonki usne apni taraf se niyamon kaa ulanghan nahin kiya he
 Will government departments also go
 faisalaa sunaane se pehle neshnal green tribunel ne van or paryaavaran mantralay kii khinchaai kii kyonki usne mangalvaar ko maanga gaya halafanama nahin saunpa tha
 The National Green Tribunal said, "please take clear instructions from the ministry whether permission is needed to construct a temporary bridge over the Yamuna
" paryaavaran mantralay ne baad main apane efidavit main kaha ki yamuna ke basin main asthaayee dhaanchon ke nirmaan ke liye paryaavaran se judi koi manzuri nahin chahie
 However, in another affidavit to the NGT earlier, the Ministry of Environment had said that any construction in the basin of Yamuna is illegal
 yani is maamle par paryaavaran mantralay kaa koi ek stand nahin dikhaa jabaki paryaavaran mantralay kii is maamle main badi jimmedaari banati he
 When we went to the site of the Ministry of Environment, we found a department there National River Conservation Directorate
 is vibhaag kii zimmedaari he desh main nadiyon, unamem rahane vaale jeev jantuon, jhiilon, or wetelends ke sangrakshan kaa kaam karnaa
 For this it is the responsibility of implementing Central Government schemes such as National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) and National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Eco-systems (NPCA)
 saafe he yamuna kinare is aayojan ke dauraan is vibhaag kii bhoomika kahin spasht dikhaai nahin di
 The reception committee's list of this event should be seen

 NGT also asked the Ministry of Water Resources if they have any role in this matter, then the Ministry has clearly said that they have no role
 or ye baat sansad ke baahar jal sansaadhan mantri uma bharti ne khud bhi kahi
 Now the question is, how can a ministry that has the responsibility of maintaining the country's rivers and its flood basin make such a statement
 ham jal sansaadhan mantralay kii website par gaye
 There is a complete department called Upper Yamuna River Board which comes under this ministry
 is board main central water kamishan ke alaava uttar pradesh, uttarakhand, haryana, rajasthan, himachal pradesh or dilli ke sadsy hote hai
 This board, made to ensure minimum flow of water in Yamuna, has many other responsibilities
 inamen yamuna ke khadar main zamin ke upar or zamin ke andar pani kii gunvattta ko behatar karnaa, yamuna basin main pani ke bahaav ke aankadon ko jamaa karnaa, dilli main okhla bairaj tak sabhi projects kii nigaraanee or samiksha shaamil he
 It is clear that this department of the ministry also did not play any clear role
 yahi nahin is aayojan se pehle paryaavaran par padane vaale asar kaa koi adhyayan nahin kiya gaya
 According to the Indian Express, last year, the NGT had given an order prohibiting any kind of construction along the banks of the Yamuna
 aap jaanate hai ki yamuna ko bachaane ko lekar mathura se ek bada andolan samay samay par dilli aata rahata he
 The comments pichley saal march ke maheene main hi mathura yamuna muktikaran padayatra dilli ke liye ai thi

 tikat bantwaare ko lekar beete dinon congress ke purv pradesh adhyaksh ashok tanvar ne dilli main party mukhyalay ke baahar pradarshan kiya tha
 He alleged that tickets were being sold for the upcoming assembly elections in the state
 ashok tanvar ne lagaaya tha tikat bechney kaa aarompane samarthakon ko sambodhit karte hue ashok tanvar ne purv mukhyamantri bhupendra hooda par nishaanaa saadhaa or aarope lagaaya tha ki sohana vidhansabha kaa tikat 5 karod main bechaa gaya he
 He accused Hooda of 'fixing the match' with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 bhartiya cricket control board (bisisiai) es
 Sreesanth has agreed to consider a lifetime ban on him
 NDTV se khaas baatcheet main ye baat kahi bisisiai ke sachiv anuraag thakur ne
 Anurag Thakur said, though BCCI still takes the spot fixing issues very seriously lekin agar koi bisisiai kii agali meeting main is par charchaa karnaa chahta he to is par baat zarur kar sakate hai
 However, it is not to be understood that Sreesanth's road ahead is going to be easy
 bisisiai ke niyamon ke hisaab se ye zaruri nahin ki court jinhen sabooton ke abhaav main begunaah chhod de, unhen bisisiai sazaa nahin de saktaa
 The BCCI has its own way of functioning and the Court has its own way
 thakur kii maane to is desh main phixing ko lekar kade kanoon abhi nahin hai, isliye kisi ko is maamle main kanoonee taur par sazaa dena bahut mushkil ho jaataa he, lekin iskaa matlab ye nahin ki wo in khilaadiyon ko sazaa nahin de sakate
 Delhi court on the issue of spot fixing s
 srisanth, ajit chandila or ankit chavaan ko jab se bari kiya he tab se ye sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya bhartiya cricket control board in khilaadiyon se bain hataayega?tippaniyan Initially, BCCI also showed its attitude and said that even though they respect the court order, the ban on these players will not be removed, because BCCI has found these players guilty in their investigation
 lekin iske baad kerala cricket sangh srisanth ke saath khadaa nazar aayaa or vahaan se apil hui ki srisanth par lage pratibandh ko hataa diya jaae
 This BCCI initiative may not have solved Sreesanth's problems, but has certainly created a ray of hope for him
 anuraag thakur ne kaha, haalanki bisisiai ab bhi spot phixing ke muddon ko behad gambhirtha se leti he But if anyone wants to discuss it in the next meeting of BCCI, then it can definitely be discussed
 halanki ise ye hargiz na samajha jaae ki srisanth kii aage kii raah aasaan hone vaali he
 According to the BCCI rules, it is not necessary that the court cannot leave the BCCI punishable by those who leave innocent in the absence of evidence
 bisisiai ke kaam karne kaa apana tarika he or court kaa apana
 According to Thakur, there are no strict laws related to fixing in this country, so it becomes very difficult to punish anyone legally in this case, but this does not mean that they cannot punish these players

 Ever since the acquittals of Sreesanth, Ajit Chandila and Ankit Chavan, there has been a question whether the Board of Control for Cricket in India will lift the ban on these players? shuru main bisisiai ne apane tevar bhi dikhaae or kaha ki bhale wo court ke aadesh kaa sammaan karte hai lekin in khilaadiyon par se bain nahin hatega, kyonki bisisiai apni chaanbin main in khilaadiyon ko doshi paa chukaa he
 But after this the Kerala Cricket Association was seen standing with Sreesanth and there was an appeal that the ban on Sreesanth be lifted
 bisisiai kii is pahal ne bhale hi srisanth kii samasyaon ko hal na kiya ho, lekin unke liye ummid kii ek kiran zarur khadi kar di he
 However, it is not to be understood that Sreesanth's road ahead is going to be easy
 bisisiai ke niyamon ke hisaab se ye zaruri nahin ki court jinhen sabooton ke abhaav main begunaah chhod de, unhen bisisiai sazaa nahin de saktaa
 The BCCI has its own way of functioning and the Court has its own way
 thakur kii maane to is desh main phixing ko lekar kade kanoon abhi nahin hai, isliye kisi ko is maamle main kanoonee taur par sazaa dena bahut mushkil ho jaataa he, lekin iskaa matlab ye nahin ki wo in khilaadiyon ko sazaa nahin de sakate

 This BCCI initiative may not have solved Sreesanth's problems, but has certainly created a ray of hope for him

 mumbai main sensor board offis ke baahar pradarshan kar rahe karani sena ke kaaryakartaaon ko police ne hiraasat main le liya he
 As part of the pre-determined protests, activists from across the country were opposing the controversial film Padmavat by Sanjay Leela Bhansali
 bataa den ki shanivaar subah 11 baje se hi do-do chaar-chaar kii sankhya main karani sena ke samarthak sensor board ke offis pahunchane lage
 The arrival of the workers continued till one o'clock in the afternoon
 police maukey par najar rakhe hue thi
 Around 96 protesters were taken into custody in the afternoon
 phir unhen dakshin mumbai ke gamdevi police stesan le jaaya gaya
 While objecting to the role of the censor in the certification of Padmavat, Karni Sena on Sunday said that Bhansali's entire film should be banned
 bhansaali ke film kii shooting shuru hone ke baad se hi karani sena lagaataar padmavat kaa virodh kar rahi he
 It is alleged that the film has tampered with historical facts
 rani padmini ke charitra ko galat tareeke se pesh kiya gaya
 On December 1, the film was not passed in the censor due to lack of certification process
 is vajah se nirmaataaon kii ore se tay relies par padmavat cinemagharon tak nahin pahunch pai
 After the resumption of the process, there are reports that the censor has approved the film with some changes
 film ke 25 yaa 26 janvari ko relies kiye jane kii sambhaavna bhi he
 Since then, angry about the role of the censor, Karni Sena is threatening to not run the film across the country
 padmavat: relies se pehle hi bhansaali kii film ko karodon kaa nuksanahamaare fatve se bijepi ko dar, har haal main rokenge pradarshnaudhar, shanivaar kokerani sena ke lokentre singh kalvine kaha, 'pradhanmantri vishesh paristhiti ke aadhaar par padmavat kaa pradarshan roak sakate hai
 The Censor Board has not given clearance to Padmavat yet
 ' unhone kaha, 'ham kisi bhi haalat main padmavat ke relies kii anumati nahin de sakate hai
 We have no objection to films like Bahubali based on Kshatriya issues
 ham padmavati par banane vaali kisi bhi film kaa swaagat karte hai
 But not on the condition of tampering with historical facts
 ' unhone daawa kiya ki 'padmavat' par hamaare fatve ko lekar aagaamee chunaavon ke maddenjar bijepi ko dar he
 The army, threatening to burn theaters, has objected to the film's release across the country
 dhamkee bhi di he ki agar film relies hui to cinemagharon ko jala diya jayega
 a leader of the Karni Sena even said that if anything changes with the name change, we will consider petrol as Ganga water and sprinkle it in theaters and set it on fire
 padmavat:sensor board ke saath 9 ghante kii bahes ke baad ghumar gane main tay hua ye badlavarajasthan ke baad in do rajyon ne bhi kiya binmadhya pradesh main shivaraj singh chouhan or gujarat main vijay roopaani ne pehle kii gai ghoshnaa ke mutabiq padmavat par bain jari rakhane kaa faisla kiya he
 On Saturday, Rupani said, 'padmavat' was banned even before the elections in Gujarat, which is still upheld
 gujarat main film relies nahin hogi
 Earlier Vasundhara Raje Sarkar has also stopped the screening of the film in Rajasthan
 bataa den ki gujarat vidhansabha chunaav se pehle aitihaasik tathyon ke saath chhedchhad par mache ghamaasan ke baad upi, uttarakhand or punjab jaise rajyon ne bhi vivaadit content ke saath film kii relies rokane kii baat kii thi
 Film can be banned in Himachal too? a few days ago, there were also reports that the Himachal government has also withdrawn from the film's performance
 sutron ke mutabiq sarkaar nahin chaahati ki rajya main is film kaa pradarshan ho
 The police in Goa have recommended to the state government that Padmavat not be released
 iske peeche goa police kaa tark he, yah sijan paryatakon kaa he
 Violence or controversy may erupt upon release of the film
 mumbai police ne 26 janvari ke maukey par security kaarnon ke chalate film kii relies ko taalane kii baat kii he
 Not to mention the official release date that the film is expected to be released on January 25 or 26 but no official statement has been issued by Bhansali or Viacom18 yet
 kuch hi din pehle sensor ne film kii certification prakriya puri hone kii jaankaree di thi
 The censor constituted a committee for this
 cameti kii siforeeshon ke baad nirmaataaon ke saath ek meeting main film main 5 jaruri badlaav sujhaaye gaye the
 These changes are on the points that Deepika's film Padmavat has been opposing for the last several months
 is bich mangalvaar ko yah khabar bhi saamne ai ki film main sensor ne 300 kats lagaae hai
 However, shortly after, Censor Chief Prasoon Joshi rejected the cut claim
 kaha film main koi cat nahin kuch badlaav sujhaaye gaye the
 a few days ago, an e-mail sent to the media, Prasoon revealed the details of 5 changes
 pedman ke saath bhidntadeepika, ranvir singh or shahid kapur starer padmavat ke jis taarikh ko relies hone kii charchaa he usee date par akshay kumaar kii pedman bhi relies ho rahi he
 The film is based on social issues
 pehle charchaa thi ki padmavat kii vajah se pedman kii date aage khiskegi lekin nirmaataa pehle se nirdhaarit date par hi film relies ko taiyaar hai

 com / vvgs4kdynj — Sony Xperia India (@sonyxperiaindia) August 25, 2015 bhopal gas traasadee ke maamle main apni chuppi todate hue congress netaa evam tatkaaleen madhyapradesh mukhyamantri arjuna singh ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki union carbide ke tatkaaleen pramukh warren anderson ko chhodane ke liye kendriya grih mantralay se kai baar phone aaye the or is bare main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ne anderson ke samarthan main ek bhi shabd nahin kaha tha
 Arjun Singh while participating in the discussion on the events related to Bhopal gas tragedy in Rajya Sabha said that he had decided to arrest Anderson as soon as he stepped on the land of Bhopal
 vah chaahate the ki is maamle main anderson kii giraftaar ho jaae taaki use uske khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane ke liye jarurat padane par use bulaayaa ja sake
 Singh said that at that time the situation had become such that when Anderson arrived at the airport, several media persons and the relatives of the affected people came to know of his arrival and they had reached there
 is baat kii ashanka thi ki gussaye log use peet peet kar maar daalenge
 He said that after the arrest, the then Chief Secretary of the state told him that several calls had been received from the Union Home Ministry to release Anderson
 singh ne kaha ki unhone iskaa nirnay mukhya sachiv par chhod diya
 Singh said that he can say with utmost sincerity and responsibility that the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi did not say a single word in support of Anderson or to overcome his problem
 arjuna singh ne kaha ki traasadee ke liye anderson sidhe taur par jimmedaar he
 He said that the government should make every effort to extradite him and demand adequate and full compensation for the accident
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko america raashtrapati baraak obama kii kii aagaamee yatra ke dauraan anderson ke pratyrpan or muaavje ke liye jor dena chahie
 While expressing his view of the incident, Singh said that he found it absurd that Anderson left from Bhopal on a government plane
 lekin unhone is maamle main adhik byora nahi dete hue kaha ki vah is bare main vistaar se nahin kahana chaahate kyonki isse pidaa or katutaa badhegi
 Arjun Singh said that on December 4, the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi visited Bhopal after the Bhopal accident
 unhone pradhanmantri ko istife kii peshkash kii thi lekin rajeev gandhi ne unhen aisa karne se manaa kar diya
 Rajiv Gandhi told him that no one is blaming the Chief Minister for this
 singh ne kaha ki traasadee ke baad ‘maine apane hi khilaaf en ke singh ayog kaa gathan kiya tha
 He said that he had felt the toxic gas on the night of the accident and some people advised him to leave Bhopal
 lekin vah mukhyamantri hone ke kaaran bhopal se baahar nahin gayi

 manish sisodiya ne bataaya ki jiesti act apane aap main bahut acha concept he
 Our government will call the assembly session tomorrow and also pass this act
 lekin unhone jiesti ke proscisger par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki jiesti apadhapi main janata par thopa nahin janaa chahie
 After meeting with the trade wings, Manish Sisodian called the tax slabs on branded flour, tax on auto and tractor parts, steel, broom, medicines, bathroom hardware, marble, goggles, snacks etc
 wrong and a burden on the general public
 
 iske alaava manish sisodiya ne ye bhi kaha ki in sabhi chizon par tex badhaane par trade or tryder donon prabhavit honge
 Chairman of the trade wing Brajesh Goyal said that the Finance Minister (manish Sisodia) has assured us that in the GST Council to be held on June 3, we will raise the issue of tax on all these things
 in chizon par sunwaayee na hone par trade wing neshantipurvak andolnaki bhi baat kahi he
 All the traders also supported GST but appealed to keep Delhi's business in mind

 The UGC, in a letter sent to the Registrar of Universities, said that no change has been made in the reservation policy for faculty posts in central universities
 iske alaava vishvavidhyalayon, dimd vishvavidhyalayon, collejon or anudaan praapt sansthaanon evam kendron main sarkaar kii aarakshan niti ke sakht anupaalan ke dishanirdeshon main bhi koi badlaav nahin hua he
 The ugc's response comes against the backdrop of the attack on the NDA government by RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav and leaders of other political parties claiming that they want to abolish the reservation
 lalu ne mangalvaar ko daawa kiya ki centre sarkaar kendriya vishvavidhyalayon main professor or associat prophessoron kii bhartee main obisi ke liye 27 pratishat aarakshan ko samaapt kar rahi he

 It was said in the letter that in case of OBC, 27 percent reservation is applicable only at the level of Assistant Professor

 ek angreji akhbaar ne khabar di he ki aam aadmi party ke sansthaapak arvind kejariwal ne ek twit karke 80 lakh rupee se bhi zyada kii rakam juta lee he
 It is said that Kejriwal appealed to the people to donate to help in the election campaign of Varanasi and Amethi
 iske baad hi paison kii barsaat hone lagi
 80 lakh rupees came from the whole world as donations

 The Aam Aadmi Party has a huge shortage of money to contest the Lok Sabha elections

 With this, the Home Minister introduced the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Bill in the Rajya Sabha on Monday, under which the status of full state was abolished and divided into 2 union territories
 is bade or aitihaasik kadam ke baad ab is baat kii sambhaavna banati dikh rahi he ki jammu-kashmir ko ek gaiyr muslim mukhyamantri mil saktaa he
 Based on the current system, in the 87-member assembly, 46 seats come from Kashmir Valley, 37 seats from Jammu region and 4 seats from Ladakh region
 iske alaava vidhansabha main rajyapal ke paas yah adhikaar he ki agar use lagata he ki sadan main mahilaon ko paryaapt pratinidhitiv hasil nahin he to vah 2 mahilaon ko nominete kar saktaa he
 Since the Assembly has more seats than other regions in the Kashmir Valley, in this sense, the party that wins in the Kashmir region has the possibility of occupying power
 badal jayega nakshaajammu evam kashmir punargathan bill 2019 rajyasabha main paas ho chukaa he or ab ise loksabhaa main paas hona he
 As a Union Territory, Kargil and Leh will join 2 important and very popular districts under the Ladakh region which comes on the map of the country
 jabaki punargathan ke baad centre shasit pradesh ke rup main nakshe par aane vaale jammu-kashmir main leh or ladakh ko chhodkar shesh jile aa jaaenge
 At present, there is a predominantly Hindu population in the Jammu region, while the Muslim majority in the Kashmir region, while the majority population living in the Ladakh region belongs to the Buddhist community

 In the event of a new Surat, a Delimitation Commission will be formed there and new seats will be decided
 sarkaar ne vidhansabha kshetron ke parisemen kaa prastaav bhi kar diya he
 Out of 22, 4 districts (kathua, Jammu, Samba and Udhampur) are Hindu dominated districts while Leh is inhabited by Buddhist societies, apart from the remaining 17 districts with Muslim majority population

 After the valley, Jammu has the largest population of Gurjars and Bakarwals
 gurjar or bakarwaal bhed or bakriyaan paalate hai
 a large number of these two communities believe in the religion of Islam and live on the mountain, but there is not much enthusiasm among the community about the major parties of the valley, PDP and National Conference, in such a situation that after delimitation it can be considered that new In the event of a system, this community should support other parties
 parisemen hone kii sthiti main jammu main vidhansabha siton kii sankhya bad sakati he, to nai vyavastha or desh kaa ek kanoon chalane kii surat main gurjar or bakarwaal kii sthiti majboot ho sakati he or kai vidhansabha kshetron main nirnaayak voter kii bhoomika main aa sakate hai
 Assembly elections will now be contested in Jammu and Kashmir as a union territory
 parisemen ke baad jammu main siten bad jaaengi jabaki nai vyavastha ke baad kai raajnneetik dal kashmir main bhi jaakar chunaav lard sakate hai
 In such a situation, it can be believed that the day is not far when a leader of a non-muslim society in Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir becomes the Chief Minister

 Three years after the disappearance of the 4-year-old girl, a phone call has been received to her parents for ransom money
 ye maamla noida ke sector-22 kaa he, jahaan aaj se kareeb teen saal pehle 2016 main sanjay kii beti kashish ghar ke baahar khelte hue rahasyamay dhang se gaayab ho gai thi
 At that time, her family members also protested about the disappearance of the daughter, questioning the functioning of the police
 teen saal pehle gaayab hui thi 4 varshiya kashishapariwaar kaa kahana he ki unki 4 saal kii beti teen saal pehle gum hui thi
 Now someone is calling and asking for 10 lakh rupees of ransom from them
 phone kol aane ke baad kashish naam kii us bacchee ke pita sanjay ravat ne police main shikaayat darj karwaai he
 Sanjay, father of extortion call girl Kashish, who came between 8-10 July, claims that he has received about 10 phone calls for ransom between 8 and 10 July
 sanjay ke mutabik, sabhi kol alag-alag number se aate hai
 Father Sanjay told that, 'the caller says that my daughter is with him in Punjab
 usne kaha he ki agar main apni beti ko jinda dekhnaa chaahate ho to 10 lakh rupee de do
 i asked her for a picture of my daughter, but she refused to send the photo
 'pita ne police main shikaayat karai darjafirauti kaa kol aane ke baad sanjay ne sector 24 main shikaayat darj karwaai he
 Police has registered an FIR and started investigation
 vahiin, police ko jin alag-alag number se phone aayaa, unki bhi padtaal kar rahi he
 According to SSP Vaibhav Krishna, the caller is referring to himself from Punjab, while the numbers from which the call came are from Telangana and West Bengal
 police ko shaq he ki kahin koi sanjay ko beti ke naam par thagne kii koshish to nahin kar rahaa
 Was missing in 2016, tell you that Kashish went missing in 2016
 12 may ko kashish ke pita sanjay ne police main shikaayat darj karwaai thi ki unki beti kashish noida ke sector-22 main unke ghar ke aage se hi khilne ke dauraan laapata ho gai thi
 At that time the police had investigated Noida, Ghaziabad, Delhi, Bulandshahr, Hapur, Meerut, etc
, but could not find any trace
 ab achaanak teen saal baad phiroti ke liye kol aane se police bhi hairaan he, lekin esaspi vaibhav krishna kaa daawa he jald hi puure maamle kaa sulajhaa liya jayega
 Arvind Kejriwal accepted to be the CM of Delhi after much deliberation, but his real troubles will start now
 unhone aam logon ke man main ummiido kii jo jyoti jala di he, ab vah aag banakar puri tarah se dadhak rahi he
 Every man is waiting for when he will get the electricity bills halved and when there will be an abundant supply of clean water
 theke par kaam kar rahe hajaaron safaikarmi intazaar kar rahe hai ki kab unki naukari pakki ho or kab unhen badi hui tankhwaah mili
 There are many other expectations that people are sitting on
 ab tak jo khabaren saamne aa rahi hai, unase lagata to he ki in muddon par kejariwal gambhir hai or is disha main pahal karte hue ek behad eemaandaar adhikari ko apana pramukh sachiv banane kaa iraadaa rakh rahe hai
 It is important that he deploy honest and experienced officers around him
 kejariwal khud beurocrat rahe hai or unhen pataa he ki sarkaar main filein kaise gumti hai
 If he takes those good officers along, the work will be a little easier for him
 kejariwal kya socialist sarkaar chalaanaa chaahate hai, kya vah vampanthi sarkaar ke himachati hai yaa phir vah bengal kii tarah rajya ko karj main dubo dena chaahate hai? aise kai prashn hawa main laharaa rahe hai or unke jawaab dhunde ja rahe hai
 From the figures which have come out about the expenditure on electricity, water, pucca jobs, it seems something similar because billions of rupees are needed for all these which the Delhi government does not have
 vah kendra sarkaar kii tarah note nahin chhap sakati he
 In such a situation, the Delhi government will take the draft, which may be impossible for him to repay
 kai baar jo saamne dikhataa he yaa saidhantik rup se aasaan lagata he, vah vyaavhaarik rup se itnaa kathin ho jaataa he ki use sulajhane main kai baras biit jate hai or arvind kejariwal ke paas samay bahut kam he
 This is his biggest problem and roadblock
 to ab arvind kejariwal ke jaadu ke duusare bhaag kaa intazaar kiijie
 Retig: 2 Artists: Akshay Kumar, Siddharth Malhotra, Jackie Shroff and Jacqueline fernandesdirector: Karan Malhotrahar brings Bollywood new films with the week
 jinhen dheron paise, khub prachaar or bade bol kii chaashni ke saath lagaakar pesh kiya jaataa he
 The result: films that are not original are found
 copy bhi koi aisi-waisi nahin, asli vaali copiah hoobahoo
 Bollywood is not able to get out of this vicious cycle
 aisa hi kuch is hafte bhi hua he
 Karan Malhotra made a strong debut in Bollywood through the remake of 'agneepath'
 unhen rimek kaamyaab formula laga
 This time he has brought a remake of Hollywood film 'warrior' as 'brothers' but could not bring his edge
 ve nakal ke chakkar main to pad gaye lekin us tarah dimag nahin laga sake ki film baandh kar rakh paati
 In the process of fighting the film on many fronts, they are seen battered on every front
 film kii kul puunji akshay kumaar he
 'brothers' is a very bad story with a good story
 kahani menkitna damayah kahani pita or do beton kii he, ek majaboor pita or pati kii he, khud ko sabit karne kii jugat main lage bete kii he,bhaaiyonke rishte kii he
 The story has everything that the Indian audience wants to see
 lekin vah conect nahin jo darshakon ko jodta he
 It is the story of a family that is scattered
 pita jaiki shroff he or bete akshay kumaar or siddharth malhotra hai
 The situation is such that two brothers are seen battling each other in the fighting ring
 film kaa pehla half bahut sust he or kairactors ko set karne main guzar jaataa he jabaki duusare main fiting he
 It seems that the director had saved the action for the second half
 isi chakkar main film bahut hi flats ho jaati he
 The film is over two and a half hours
 bollywood main lambii filmein banane kaa trend laut rahaa he
 Because of which many times films seem to be pulled, this time it is the same
 training vaale seen mjedaar hai
 Star Appeal is the USP of the movie
 ve hard or soft donon luk main solid najar aate hai
 They win hearts in the role of brother and also in the role of fighter
 jaiki shroff ne bhi apane luk kii bajaae apni acting se zyada impress kiya he
 Jacqueline Fernandes has also done well
 sabane jo bhi role mili bahut hi khubi se nibhaae hai
 Oh yes, even Siddharth
 abhi unako bahut mehnat karne kii jarurat he
 He has a stone face and no emotion comes on his face
 chaahe ection ho yaa bhaavnaatmak seen ve ek hi mudra main rahete hai
 They will have to change their currencies slightly
 karina kapur kaa item sang bilkul bhi asar nahin daalata he chameli ke aage to pani bharta he
 The film is about big budget and if sources are to be believed, it is about 75-80 crores
 ke bich kaa maamla he
 The film has a huge starcast and also a big banner like Dharma Production
 film ko normal weekend mil rahaa he
 So the challenge is tough
 film kaa mujeec everej rahaa he or is baat main koi shubahaa nahin ki ise lekar jabardast hip rahi he
 There is no doubt that everything from the story of the film to the promotion and from the starcast to the production house was amazing
 lekin kahani ke saath kharaab saluk niraash karata he, yahi baat darshakon ke saath conect banane main baadha paidaa kar sakati he
