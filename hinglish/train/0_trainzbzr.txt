 The youth who are rapidly moving towards the threshold of youth often live in dream world
 ve sex ko lekar bahut zyada utsaahi hote hai or is ati utsaah main kai galtiyaan bhi kar jate hai
 They do such activities, which they later have to bear the brunt
 kai baar sex ke bare main jaanane kii chahat main bahari nuksaan to kam hota he, lekin unhen naitikta kaa nuksaan jarur uthaanaa padataa he
 As soon as possible, youngsters eager to learn about sex take many wrong steps
 ye hai unamem se 10 galtiyaan
 
 
 1
 ashleel video dekhnaa or share karnajise-jaise mobile or internet kranti aage bad rahi he vaise-vaise ye beemaari bhi bad rahi he
 The youth moving towards stepping on the threshold of puberty are accidentally trapped in this trap
 ve manoranjan ke liye or sex ke bare main jaanane ke liye ashleel video kaa sahaara lete hai
 This mistake is compounded when they start sharing such videos with friends
 aise main unke kanoon ke jaal main fasanne kii gunjaaish bahut zyada hoti he
 2
 public place main ladakiyon se chipakane kii koshishais umr main sex ko lekar yuva bahut zyada utsuk hote hai or aise main ve public place main ladakiyon se chipakane kii bhi koshish se baj nahin aate
 Be it crowded bus or metro and big fair, they make every effort to reach out to young girls as much as possible
 aise main ladakiyon se chipaknaa, unhen jabardastee chune kii koshish karnaa kai baar in yuvaaon ko kanoon ke pachadon main fansaa detaa he
 Apart from this, there is a public outrage among the public
 3
 Strutting in women's washrooms To calm their curiosity, these young women don't stumble into the washroom
 sex ke bare main apane gyaan kii kunjee ko motaa karne ke liye ve mahilaon ke washroom main jaakar use kareeb se dekhne bhi pahunch jate hai
 Basically they want to know how women's washrooms differ from men's washrooms
 yah galati bhi kai baar unhen baari pad jaati he
 4
 mahila dost se sex sambandh banane kii koshishfilm bie paas kaa ek sinis umr main ham-umr ladakiyon se dosti hona aam baat he
 But the rapidly growing boys try every possible way that their girlfriends somehow reach the bedroom
 aise main ve apane doston tak se lard padate hai
 They try their best to find sex in this relationship of friendship
 kai baar to yah koshish jabardastee tak pahunch jaati he
 Due to raw understanding, they may also have to visit the Juvenile Home due to taking such a step
 5
 Masturbating excessively In order to fulfill their frustrations associated with sex, youth start masturbating excessively
 haalanki is baat kaa koi vaigyanik pramaan nahin he ki hastmaithun se kisi tarah kii koi kamajori aati he
 But again and again this action increases their frustrations related to sex, which can be fatal for them later
 unke khud ke liye or samaaj ke liye bhi
 6
 mahilaon ke undergarments par najar rakhanin taaja-taaja yuvaaon ko lagata he ki mahilaon ke undergarments kisi duusari duniya kii chijen hai
 They keep trying to hide and see them
 kai baar baahar suukh rahe undergarments par coment karnaa or kai baar aasapaas maujuud ladakiyon ke undergarments main jhaankne kii koshish unhen badi musiibat main daal sakati he
 7
 parkon main couples ke paas jaakar unhen pareshaan karnasex or relationships ko lekar ye yuva bahut zyada utsaahi hote hai
 In this excitement, they go to the lovers, sitting in seclusion in parks, cinemas etc
 and harass them
 sex se judi apni kunthaon ke chalate ve kisi bhi tarah se ladki ko hasil karnaa chaahate hai
 This effort is causing trouble and can deliver them behind bars
 8
 Sending obscene text and videos on the phone of unknown girls leads to many more mistakes due to ignorance or frustration
 unamem se ek ye bhi he ki agar unhen kahin se kisi anjaan ladki kaa phone number mil jaae to ve us par blank kol karne lagate hai
 Even by sharing pornographic messages and videos, girls do not desist from harassing them
 aise main ve kabhi bhi sibar krime ke jaal main funs sakate hai
 9
 sex ajukeshan kii sadakchhaap kitaaben padhanasex ke bare main jaanane kii itani lalak in yuvaaon main hoti he ki ve kahin se bhi iske bare main jaanane kii firaaq main rahete hai
 For this, they resort to books from the Internet to the street sex education books
 ‘mastaram’ tip kii ye kitaaben unhen sex ajukeshan kitna detii hai, is par koi daawa to kitaab chhapane vaale bhi nahin kar sakate
 But these books definitely fill the frustrations associated with sex
 10
 The activities of girls walking outside the school - the movement of the girls outside the school and the way of standing on their leave are also seen at this age
 is bich ladakiyon ko chhedana, un par fabtiyaan kasnaa jaisi harakatein karke unhen lagata he ki ve ab bade ho gaye hai or unki yah harakatein unhen ladakiyon kii najar main ooncha uthaa rahi hai
 But these actions can entice the police as well as to beat them
 bollywood deva shridevi ke nidhan se puraa desh sadame main he
 There is also a wave of mourning in Pakistan due to the death of the actress at the age of just 54 years
 film mom main shridevi ke saath kaam kar chuke pakistani kalakaar actress kii maut kii khabar sunakar nishabd hai
 In the film, Sajal Ali Firdaus, who became Sridevi's daughter, wrote on Instagram, mourning - i again lost my mother

 She did not let me miss her mother in India and she was my mother in India

 This is a special moment for all of us
 ek intervyuu main shridevi ne bataaya tha ki sajal kii jahnavi or khushi se baatcheet hua karti thi
 Sridevi underwent 29 surgeries to look beautiful, was this the cause of death? Apart from Sajal Ali, Pakistani actor Adnan Siddiqui also worked with Sridevi in mom

 north korea or america ke bich ab zabaani jang bhi aakhri mukaam par he
 Marshal Kim Jong Un is already bent on war, but now even US President Donald Trump has threatened an attack on North Korea like never before
 lekin kim jong un ko daraane kii har america koshish ke bich main china kii diwaar khadi he
 US Intelligence Satellite has revealed Kinorth Korea helps China
 yuan ke pratibandh ke baad bhi china kim ke saath he
 China has been caught red handed helping dictator Kim
 ek taraf north korea kaa marshall kim he to duusari taraf mahashaktishaalee desh kaa raashtrapati
 Without seeing each other face to face, they start hating themselves so much that they do not breathe peacefully without attacking each other
 donald trump ne sabase badi chetavanee dete hue kim ko tabah karne kii kasam kha lee he to vahiin kim ne jawaab main america dweep goam ko barbaad karne kii dhamkee de di he
 But the echo of this tension of both of them is now being heard in China as well
 trump ko bhi pataa he or duniya bhi ye jaanati he ki jab tak china he
 Till then, America cannot attack North Korea
 isaki vajah se north korea se uski aarthik saajhedaari yaa dosti nahin balki iske kai kaaran hai
 It is also true that if someone can get North Korea settled without any war, then it is China
 yahi vajah he ki america is maamle main china ke role par jor de rahaa he
 Trump himself also lured China into expanding trade
 magar china abhi dur se hi tamaasha dekhne kii niti apana rahaa he
 However, China itself wants to solve this problem peacefully
 kyonki wo jaanata he ki jang ke halaat main use kai tarah kii dikkaton se do-chaar hona padegaa
 And the biggest problem will be North Korean refugees
 jo jang chhidane par japan or south korea na jaakar sirf china kaa ruukh karenge
 If the US attacks North Korea, it may have to take it because China will have to support North Korea in any event of war
 aisa isliye kyonkiamerica or north koriadonon ke ek saath china kii sandhiyaan hai
 China and Russia supported North Korea in the war between North and South Korea from 1950 to 1953
 jiske baad yuan kii madhyasthata main hui ek yudhviram sandhi ke saath hi ye jang khatm hui thi
 During the treaty, an agreement was also reached between Washington and Beijing that if the US attacked North Korea in the future, the cease fire would break
 iske alaava 1961 main china or uttar korea kii vampanthi sarkaron ne aapas main ek or ahm sandhi kii thi
 Its name was 'sino-north Korean Mutual Assistance and Cooperation Friendship Treaty'
 is sandhi main kaha gaya he ki agar china or north korea main se kisi bhi desh par agar koi doosraa desh hamalaa karata he to donon deshon ko turant ek-duusare kaa sahyog karnaa padegaa
 In the past years, these two countries have extended the validity period of this treaty to 2021
 videsh maamalon ke kuch jaankaar kehete hai ki is sandhi se donon deshon ko bada phayda mila he
 While China made its business interests with it, North Korea managed to secure itself further by making this treaty
 aarthik najariye se bhi china ke liye north korea bahut zyada ahm he
 For the last four decades, the North Korean market has a Chinese reputation
 iske alaava america senaaon kii is kshetra main maujuudagi ne bhi china ko pareshaan kar rakhaa he or isiilie wo jald is samasya ko hal karnaa chahta he
 China is constantly trying to somehow end the situation of war
 isiilie chini videsh mantri ne america or uttar korea donon ko hi chetate hue kaha tha ki agar yuddh hua to usamen jeet kisi kii nahin hogi jabaki donon ko kabhi na dur hone vaale jakhm jhelane pad sakate hai
 But now in China, there is a buzz about what will be the role of China in the event of war
 sarkari akhbaar global times ke mutabik agar america north korea ke kilaaf satta parivartan ke iraade se hamalaa karata he to china ko chup nahin rahanaa chahie
 After the violence on the occasion of Ramnavami, while the Raniganj area of west Bengal is burning, politics is being fiercely done on this issue

 unhone ye bhi kaha ki soshal media par saikadon tasviren viral ho rahi hai, jinamein se agar 25 fisadi bhi sahi nikaleen to pataa chalegaa ki halaat kitne kharaab hai

 Ghanshyam Khandelwal went into his ancestral business at the age of 17 to bring about this change in the oil business
 ghanashyam ke pita bisanlaal or taaoo kishanlaal khandelwal aazaadee ke baad se bareli main tel kaa kaarobaar karte the
 At that time, oil traders were not seen with good eyesight
 inhen ghatatolia, milavatiya yaa kalabazaaria jaise sambodhano se pukaara jaataa tha
 Ghanshyam was upset with this since school days
 bareli college se science main grajuation karne ke baad 1976 main ve apane pushtaini dhandhe main is makasad ke saath utre ki is nazariye ko badal denge
 He explains, “the evils like ghattoli and adulteration were in our business
 ise badalane ke liye maine sankalp liya ki main yah kaarobaar paramparaagat taur-tareekon se nahin karuunga
 Before starting the business, he set up a lab at Madhowadi in Bareilly where he started investigating the oil himself to find out where the disturbances were occurring
 1986 main ghanashyam ne “bail kolhu” naam se apana brands banaaya or ise trademark or egamark main register karaayaa
 Then opened an oil factory at Madhowadi in Bareilly

 In this, mustard seeds are crushed in such a way that the natural properties of the oil can be preserved by reducing the energy released from friction
 ghanashyam bataate hai, “is takanic kaa zikr ayurveda main bhi he

 unhone logon kii jaruraton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ek litre, aadha litre, do sau emel or paanch rupye, do rupye keemat ke paauch jari kiye
 He explains, “earlier oil was kept in large canisters and sold out of shops, which was heavily rigged

 After the announcement of the election of Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman, PM Modi and JDU President and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar spoke to Naveen Patnaik on phone to seek support for NDA candidate Harivansh
 yaheen se congress kaa game kharaab ho gaya
 PM Modi and Nitish Kumar talked to Naveen Patnaik on phone to support him, till then the opposition could not decide its candidate
 iskaa nateeja hua ki endie vipaksh main send lagane main kaamyaab ho gaya
 At the same time, Samajwadi Party says that it would have been better if there was consensus
 duusari taraf aam aadmi party ne kaha ki nitish kumaar ne arvind kejariwal ko phone karke endie ummidavaar harivansh ke liye samarthan maanga, lekin bijepi ke saath hone ke chalate aam aadmi party samarthan nahin kar sakati
 If Congress needs support, then Rahul Gandhi should talk to Arvind Kejriwal

 The BJP can make it a big issue that the opposition parties did not unite in the name of the Deputy Chairman and how they will become one in the name of the Prime Minister
 2014 se ab tak gujarat samet 25 rajyasabha chunaav NOTA se ho chuke hai
 Significantly, on August 3 last year, the Supreme Court refused to ban NOTA on the petition of Congress
 haalanki supreme court ne kaha tha isaki sunwaayee jari rakhi jaaegi ki rajyasabha ke chunaav main NOTA kaa istemaal ho saktaa he yaa nahin
 The court had sought a reply by issuing notice to the Election Commission on the plea of the Gujarat Congress against the use of NOTA in the Gujarat Rajya Sabha elections

 haal hi main irani ko congress par dhardaar hamale ke liye pravaktaa banaaya gaya he, kyonki vah hazirajavaab or spasht vaktaa hai
 In the last Lok Sabha election, Irani had challenged Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in Amethi, the Congress stronghold
 nehru-gandhi parivaar ke sadasyon par aaropon ke sambandh main bhaajapa kii ore se hamalaa karne main vah hameshaa mukhar rahi hai
 He has often presented the party's view clearly on the allegations made by the Congress on the government regarding the disputed Rafale aircraft deal

 Irani had a scathing response to the ridicule made by Rahul Gandhi recently when the Prime Minister was awarded the Philip Kotler Presidential Award
 gandhi ne kaha tha ki award itnaa prasiddh he ki uskaa koi juri nahin he or yah pehle kabhi kisi ko nahin diya gaya
 In retaliation, Irani said that the late Prime Ministers Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi were awarded the Bharat Ratna by their own government during Congress rule
 unhone kaha, "aarope us vyakti dwaara lagaaya gaya he, jiske labdhpratishthit parivaar ne khud ko bhi bharat-ratna pradaan karne kaa nirnay liya
 "during the winter session of Parliament, the party introduced Irani as a keynote speaker in the Lok Sabha during a debate on an important issue of BJP such as the Triple Talaq Bill
 rafel saude par bahes ke dauraan bhi rahul gandhi ne jab rakshaamantri nirmala sitaraman par jhooth bolne kaa aarope lagaaya or modi ko aksham bataaya to irani ne unako karaara jawaab diya
 Even after the Congress accused BJP president Amit Shah of 16,000 fold increase in the business of his son's company, the BJP also fielded Irani in his defense
 sabase pehle unhone hi rahul gandhi par twitor par unki badhati lokapriyata kii aalochana kii thi
 Irani was then Minister of Information and Broadcasting
 unhone twitor ke madhyam se bataaya ki retweet videshon main sthit farji acount se kiye jate hai

 His stature in the party became huge when he was made the Human Resource Development Minister in the bjp-led government in 2014

 After coming out of the strong room, Digvijay Singh did not speak to the media and asked District President Kailash Mishra to give a statement, although the exit poll estimate did not have any effect on Digvijay
 digvijay jab strang room vaali imaarat se baahar aae to unke chehre par koi shikan nahin thi

 Raj Thackeray was speaking during the election campaign for MNS candidate Pramod Raju Patil from Kalyan Lok Sabha seat adjoining Mumbai on Wednesday
 maamla logon se vot apil kaa hi tha lekin nishaanaa banaaya shivasena ke adhyaksh uddhav thakare ko

 He called me when he thought he was mine
 unhone chagan bhujabal, ganesh nike, narayana rane ko phone nahin kiya tha
 When Uddhav Thackeray left home in the car from the hospital, i had not stabbed a dagger on the back of the late Bala Saheb Thackeray
 jab main shivasena se baahar niklaa to mujhe thakare family kaa kabhi phone nahin aayaa
 'bal Thackeray did not get good food in the last days' In fact, at Sunday's Pune rally, Raj targeted Uddhav with the memorial of Bala Saheb, but Uddhav also retaliated and told Raj to stab him in the back

 This team or panel of Ompuri consists of many well known artists like Darshan Zariwala, Sushant Singh, Pallavi Joshi, Himani Shivpuri, Amit Bahl and Manoj Joshi and all are participating in the election
 bollywood main 'CINTAA' kalakaaron kii ek sanstha he, jisamen film or tivi main abhinay karne ke liye chote bade kalakaar sadsyta lete hai or ye sanstha kalakaaron ke hiton kii raksha karti he

 In Bollywood, 'CINTAA' is an association of artists, in which big and small actors are involved in acting in film and TV and it protects the interests of the artists
 magar pichley kuch samay se bahut saare charitra kalakaar khush nahin hai

 Former Railway Minister and Trinamool Congress MP Dinesh Trivedi has congratulated Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee on being nominated for the presidential nomination
 pranab sattarudh sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) ke ummidavaar hai
 Trivedi said, 'I congratulate Pranab-da on being nominated as the presidential candidate
 vah utkrisht raajnneetijna va prashaasak hai
 He deserves it

 'it is worth mentioning that Trivedi had increased the railway fares during his tenure as Railway Minister and angry Trinamool Congress President Mamata Banerjee removed him and made Mukul Roy the new Railway Minister

 The UPA on Friday declared him the presidential candidate

 Pandya scored 93 off 95 balls in the first Test and took two wickets for 27 runs in the second innings of South Africa

 He put pressure on South Africa by removing the team from pressure

 unhone kaha ,‘abhyaas match khelnaa hameshaa acha hota he
 If the Indian team was on a tour of the subcontinent, it would not have made any difference from not playing a practice match, but a practice match before playing in South Africa would have helped the adaptation

 But then the rivalry between Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot started from the race for the Chief Minister's post, not taking the name
 samay-samay par ek-duusare ke khilaaf bolte rahe donon netaa ek baar phir aamane-saamne aa gaye hai
 This time the body elections are the reason for the conflict
 pradesh main november main nikaay chunaav hone hai
 a lot of uproar has started within the Congress regarding these elections
 rajasthan ke upmukhyamantri or pradesh congress ke adhyakshaschin payalatne meyar or sthaneey nikaay ke pramukhon ke chayan ko lekar sarkaar kii ore se die gaye formule par naaraazgi jataai he
 Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot, who arrived in Jhunjhunu to campaign, expressed his displeasure at the decision to become the Mayor without contesting his own government
 payalat ne kaha ki pehle to meyar or sthaneey nikaay pramukhon ke sidhe chunaav karne ke faisle ko hamane palata, magar is par cabinet main charchaa kiye bagaiyr hamane balldor entry kaa praavdhaan kar diya
 In this, a person not contesting can also become the Mayor or Chairman
 unhone kaha ki main is nirnay ko galat maanata hum
 There was no discussion in the organization about this
 upmukhyamantri ne kaha ki maharashtra main chunaav prachaar kar rahaa tha, tab mantri ne yah nirnay liya he
 He said that he has expressed his opinion as soon as he comes from Maharashtra
 gahalot ne diya javabasachin payalat ke naaraazgi jataane ke baadamukhyamantri ashok gahalotane bhi javaabi hamalaa bol diya
 Answering a question asked about Pilot's displeasure, he said that many times people are in different roles in elections
 kaam bante hone se vyastata bad jaati he
 The Chief Minister said that hence such a provision has been made
 jo bhi meyar banegaa vah parshadon kaa vishwaas hasil karke hi banegaa
 What is the whole issue: The Minister of Autonomous Governance and Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, close to the Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, on Thursday gave a hybrid formula for the selection of the mayor and the head of the local body in the municipal and local body elections
 is formule ke anusaar sthaneey nikaay kaa chunaav nahin ladane vaala vyakti bhi meyar or sthaneey nikaay pramukh ban saktaa he
 The rationale of Parliament and Assembly was behind this formula from the government
 yah kaha gaya tha ki loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav nahin ladane vaala vyakti bhi jis tarahpradhanmantrior mukhyamantri ban saktaa he usee tarah se parshad kaa chunaav nahin ladane vaala vyakti bhi meyar or sabhapati ban saktaa he
 Two ministers had expressed their displeasure over the formula, Food Minister Ramesh Meena and then Transport Minister Pratap Singh Khachariwas lodged a protest against the Gehlot cabinet
 donon hi netaa sachin payalat gut ke maane jate hai
 Now, just as the differences between two top Congress leaders in the top two positions of power in the state, Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister have come to light just before the civic elections, the party may have to suffer

 haryana ke mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ne mahilaon or ladakiyon kii taraf uthne vaali ungali ko kaatane kaa bada bayaan diya he
 During a program in Panchkula, while advocating strict punishment for the accused of rape, he has made a statement from the forum of cutting off the finger of those who raise fingers towards women and girls
 haalanki manch se utarane ke baad jab patrakaron ne mukhyamantri se unke is bayaan par sawaal kiya, to unhone kaha ki unke kehane kaa ye matlab nahin tha kiharyanamen rape ke aropiyon kii ungali kaat di jaaegi
 There was just a sense to say that now the Haryana government will deal with rape accused and women molesters strictly
 iske saath hi manohar laal khatter ne yah bhi elaan kiya ki haryana main ab rape ke aropiyon or mahilaon se chhedhkhani karne waalon ko milane vaali tamaam sarkari yojanaon ke laabh or suvidhaon se vanchit kar diya jayega
 Only after the acquittal of the accused of rape from the court, all these government facilities will be able to meet that person again
 rape ke aropiyon ko sarkari yojanaon ke laabh or suvidhaayen na dene ke mukhyamantri ke bayaan kaa vipakshi partiyon ne swaagat kiya, lekin yah sawaal bhi kiya he ki agar rape ke aropiyon or mahilaon se chhedhkhani karne waalon ke khilaaf sarkaar itani hi sakht he, to aise main BJP ke haryana adhyaksh subhash baraala ke bete par ek IAS kii beti kaa peechha karne or chhedchhad karne ke aarope lage, to bijepi ke pradeshdhyaksh ke khilaaf khatter ne kya kaarywahi kii?vipaksh ne yah bhi poocha ki kuch din pehle panchakula ke ek HCS afasar par apane hi mahakme kii mahila se chhedhkhani karne ke aarope lage the, jiske baad afasar ko jail janaa padaa
 At present, this officer is out on bail, but instead of taking action against him, the officer who came out on bail made him the SDM of Mewat
 vipaksh ke mutabik sarkaar kii kathani or kerani main kitna fark he, wo in maamalon par khatter kii chuppi se saaf ho jaataa he
 Of course, CM Manohar Lal Khattar's decision to withdraw the benefits and facilities of all government schemes from those accused of rape and molesting women is highly commendable, but the question the opposition is asking from the government is also absolutely appropriate
 isaki vajah yah he ki isiharyanasarkaar main apane vibhaag kii mahila se chhedhkhani karne vaale afasar ko jamaanat par jail se baahar aane ke baad ek jile kaa SDM banaaya diya gaya
 In such a situation, if the opposition raises questions about the statement and actions of the government, then the government should answer these questions

 “in the midst of movement and chaos, keep stillness inside of you
 ”, says Deepak Chopra
 i truly believe in it too! If you can center yourself and your thoughts even when there's major chaos around you, that's when nothing remains impossible
 What you can achieve with a calm and composed demeanour, can never be accomplished when you have a reaction to everything that happens around you
 Breathe easy and just sometimes, let it go

 a number of speculations are being made in political circles to make former Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot in charge of Gujarat
 ek taraf gahalot gut kii taraf se kaha ja rahaa he ki punjab kaa prabharee banakar punjab jitaane kaa inaam gahalot ko mila he jabaki duusari taraf gahalot ke gujarat jane se sachin payalat kaa khemaa raahat mahasoos kar rahaa he
 There is news of Gehlot's departure from Rajasthan for Congress state president Sachin Pilot, who is nervous after losing the Dholpur by-election badly
 darasal mana ja rahaa tha ki rajasthan main vidhansabha chunaav kareeb dedh saal rah gaye hai, aise main gahalot party kii kaman apane haath main le sakate hai
 Will Ashok Gehlot win Gujarat? Gehlot suddenly became very active in the politics of the state, only then suddenly there is news of his becoming in charge of Gujarat
 haalankividhansabha chunaav harkar mukhyamantripad ganvaane ke baad se hi khaali baithe gahalot ko party ne mahasachiv banaakar ye bhi sanket die hai ki bhale hi rajya main congress kii kaman sachin payalat ke haath main hai lekin gahalot kii andekhi nahin kii jaaegi
 In fact, all BJP leaders including Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje are happy with Gehlot becoming General Secretary and moving to Gujarat
 gahalot lagaataar vasundhara or bijepi par hamlawar ho rahe the
 The Congress also felt that as the election drew near, the feud within the party would increase
 vahiin dhaulpur upachunaav main haar ke baad ishaaron-ishaaron main sachin payalat par bhi hamalaa bolte hue kaha tha ki rajya main congress ke paksh main hawa hote hue bhi overkanfidence kii vajah se haare the
 Therefore, it would be better to keep only one of them in Rajasthan
 is bich soshal media main khabaren viral honen lagi kii bijepi sachin payalat par dole daal rahi he
 Although both the Congress and the BJP denied it, but seeing the way the stampede in the Congress has taken place, at least in this situation she did not want to annoy Sachin Pilot
 saaf he sachin payalat ko ab khulaa maidan mila he or unhen upyogita sabit kerani hogi
 Along with Prashant Kishore and Ashok Gehlot, on the other hand, it is also being said that Ashok Gehlot did a very good job with Prashant Kishore in Punjab and the Congress wants to repeat the same in Gujarat
 jabaki gujarat ke prabharee gurudas kaamat seprashanth kishoraki patari nahin baith rahi thi
 It is also being said that Ashok Gehlot, close to Congress President Sonia Gandhi, has now become closer to Priyanka Gandhi's faction, while Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's choice is Sachin Pilot
 gujarat main congress kii sthiti bahut acchhee nahi he aise main gujarat main agar congress acchhee karti he to gahalot kii vaapasi agle saal rajasthan kii raajnneeti main ho sakati he or agar haar milti he to ashok gahalot ke liye mushkil ho sakati he

 Today, Iqbal Bano's death anniversary is equally famous in India and Pakistan for Ghazal singing
 unka nidhan 21 april 2009 ko hua tha
 She was known for singing ghazals and semi-classical songs
 unka janm 27 agast, 1935 ko dilli main hua tha
 Bano had associated himself with music at a young age
 unhone ustad chand khan se sangeet kii talim lee
 Banu's father gave him complete freedom to learn music, seeing his voice as a child and his passion for music
 unhone shastreey sangeet par aadhaarit sugam sangeet kii vidha thumari or daadaraa main khaasi maharath hasil kar lee thi
 After which he started singing in All India Radio
 aapako bataa den, unki umr 17 saal thi jab unki shaadi ho gai
 Iqbal Bano was equally famous in indo-pak, the identity of this poet was sung when Banosal came to Pakistan in 1952 Iqbal Bano went to Pakistan
 pakistan main unhone apni gayaki kaa pehla saarvajanik pradarshan paanch saal baad lahore art council main kiya
 Bano has also lent his voice for Pakistani films such as Gumnaam (1954), Katil (1955), Intakam (1955), Sarfarosh (1956), ishq-e-laila (1957) and Nagin (1959)
 wo ek gaanaa jo ban gaya trademarkpakistan main general jiya-ul-haq ke shashan ke daur ke aakhri dinon main faij kii nazm 'laazim he ki ham bhi dekhenge' unka trademark ban gaya tha
 zia-ul-haq imposed some restrictions in the country
 inamen auraton kaa sari pahananaa or shaayar faiz ahamed faiz ke gane gaanaa shaamil tha
 Do you know these things about Adolf Hitler? In 1985, in the Alhamra Auditorium of Lahore, Iqbal Bano was wearing a silk sari that day and Faiz's famous look in front of almost 50 thousand people, 'we shall see, abound
 That we will also see '
 gaanaa shuru kar diya
 The entire auditorium was packed
 taaliyon kii gunj ke saath log unke saath is gane ko gane ko ga rahe the
 Later, this song became his trademark
 aapako bataa den, is gane ko sunne ke baad desh ke yuva jiya-ul-haq ke taanaashaahee shashan ke khilaaf uth khadey hue the
 Raised in India, Iqbal Bano shook the politics of Pakistan by wearing a sari against the decree of zia-ul-haq by singing the song 'hum Dekhne' of Faiz
 dilli ke 360 gaanvon main sabase bada bavana gaanv he
 This village has been famous for its historical heritage, army and people who have shown valor in playgrounds
 lekin ravivaar ko muharram ke juluus kaa rasta badalane ko lekar hui mahapanchayat ne is gaanv ko media kii surkhiyon main laa khadaa kar diya
 Actually, the government had settled Bawana Resettlement JJ colony two km away from this village 10 years ago
 beete kai saal se tajie kaa juluus isi gaanv kii mukhya sadak se gujarata tha, lekin pichley saal juluus ke dauraan chhitput jhagada or gaali-galouj ke chalate gaanv ke logon ne prashasan se likhit maang kar yahaan se julus na nikaalane kii guzarish kii
 The villagers said that it is common to openly wave and chant poles in a procession of Tajej coming out in Bawana JJ Colony, and when there is such a crowd of seven to eight thousand people, which has more youth enthusiasm and less sense, then violence There is an increased chance of being
 isamen ek parchaa bhi baanta gaya, jisamen hinduon se ek hone kii baat kahi gai thi or kisi bhi haalat main juluus ko na nikalne dene kii apil kii gai thi
 Councilor of Congress, former BJP councilor and MLA Ghugan Singh were also present in this mahapanchayat
 teen ghante tak chali is mahapanchayat ke laudspikar se kai logon ke itane garam tevar sunne ko mili, jiskaa zikr bhi karnaa hamaare saamaajik taane-bane ke liye uchit nahin he
 The question arises that when a letter came in writing to people like Dr
 Ram Niwas Sehrawat in Bawana village in the afternoon that the procession of Muharram would not come out from here, why was there no attempt to stop the mahapanchayat
 iske jawaab main vah kehete hai ki kuch yuvaaon ne paanch din pehle se hi panchayat bula rakhi thi, iske chalate ise roka nahin ja sakaa
 The question is also who were the people who called the panchayat? Who are these children, who are talking about betting on loudspeakers
 mahapanchayat ke sanyojak pradeep maathur go raksha dal se bhi jude hai
 Baba is an ally of Ramdev and he continues to be known in the events of Bhagat Singh Kranti Sena
 vah kehete hai ki panchayat isliye bulaayaa janaa jaruri tha, kyonki prashasan ne likhit rup se yah baat nahin bataai thi
 Bawana village has 56 per cent males and 44 per cent females
 is gaanv main mahilaon kii sakshartaa dar mahaj 40 fisadi he
 If such a mahapanchayat takes tough decisions against social evils and abuses, it too can become media headlines

 a few weeks ago, senior Supreme Court lawyer Gopal Subramaniam was accusing the central government that his name had been removed from the appointment process of a Supreme Court judge due to his opinion in the Amit Shah case
 sarkaar kah rahi thi ki ibi kii report main pratikul baaten saamne aari hai, isliye aisa kiya gaya he
 Then the Chief Justice of India comes back from leave, Justice RM Lodha and in this case gives a statement that the executive i
e
 the government unilaterally separated the name of Gopal Subramaniam
 yah sahi nahin hua
 They further say that do not make the assumption that the independence of the judiciary is compromised
 maine hameshaa iske liye ladaa he or agar isse samjhauta hua to main sabase pehle kursi chhod duungaa
 i promise to one billion two hundred million people that the independence of the judiciary will not be compromised
 kise maaloom tha ki chand dinon baad vahi colegium katghare main hoga or bharat ke teen-teen mukhya nyaayadhish sawaalon ke ghere main
 In the balance of power, the moral force, which is dominant, is the dominant one
 ab jajon kii niyukti ke maamle main paardarshita ko lekar nyaaypalika kii jagah sarkaar bayaan de rahi he ki vah chintit he
 Those doubting Katju Saheb's nature in making the statement were shocked when the then Law Minister Hansrad Bhardwaj accepted that he had recommended the Madras High Court judge to the then Chief Justice of India
 katju sahab ne ravivaar ko blog likhakar bataaya tha ki is jaj par bhrashtachar ke kai aarope the or unke karier record main aath-aath pratikul tippaniyan thim, tab bhi raajnneetik dabaav main madras hoicourt ke acting chif justise ne un tippaniyon ko samaapt kar adishnal jaj niyukt kar diya
 According to Katju, even after the IB report, retired Chief Justice Lahoti gave a one-year extension to late Justice Ashok Kumar, Chief Justice Sabarwal gave another term and Chief Justice Balakrishnan fixed his appointment and transferred to another state
 madras hoicourt kaa ek jaj, teen-teen chif justise ke kyrkaal main pahunch rakhata he to vivaad kaise nahin hoga
 Those looking for the smell of timing in Justice Katju's blog writing should go to his Facebook and thank the Tamil people who asked Katju Saheb to also write on their experiences of the Madras High Court
 kaash in tamil bhaaiyon ne tabhi yaad dilaa diya hota, jab manmohan sarkaar ke samay katju sahab press council of india ke chairman ban rahe the
 How explosive would have been the case then is still no less
 do dinon se sansad main hangaamaa ho rahaa he
 AIDMK leaders want to know the name of the DMK minister under whose pressure the deceased judge was promoted
 kanoonmantri ravishankar prasad ne apane bayaan main bhi katju kii baat ko satyapit kar diya ki 2003 main colegium ko kuch etraz tha or tay hua ki is jaj ko pramot nahin karnaa chahie
 In the UPA regime, the PMO sought clarification as to why the name of this judge should not be proposed
 colegium ne tab bhi manaa kar diya, lekin baad main kanoon mantralay ne colegium ko likhaa ki is cese main kuch seva vistaar diya ja saktaa he
 Keep in mind that even after the IB report was against the Collegium made a judge in this case, the government did not allow the judge to become a judge because the IB report in Gopal Subramaniam case was not correct
 lihaaja ab timming nahin jajon kii niyukti kii prakriya kaa sawaal mahatvapurn he
 BJP has promised National Judicial Commission in its manifesto
 mangalvaar ko kanoon mantri ne kaha ki sarkaar isaki sthapana ko lekar gambhir he
 The UPA government introduced 'the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill' in the Rajya Sabha in August 2013
 is vidheyak par usee saal disambar main standing cameti apni report de chuki he
 Some sections of the constitution also have to be understood for this dispute
 - dhara 124 (2) 217 (1) 222 (1) pard sakate hai, jiske tahat raashtrapati ko jajon kii niyukti or tabadale kaa adhikaar diya gaya he
 According to these sections, the appointment of judges is a joint venture between the executive and the judiciary
 - magar kuch vyakhyaaon ke anusaar karypalika ko nyaaypalika par sarvocchata hasil he
 This interpretation was overturned by a 1993 decision, since then the opinion of the judiciary was considered to be the dominant one in the event of disagreement
 standing cameti ne vistaar se in baton kii samiksha kar kaha he ki samvidhan nirmaataaon ne is maamle main karypalika yaa nyaaypalika kisi ko sampurna vivekadhikaar nahin diya tha
 a balance was struck
 samvidhan main colegium shabd kaa zikr tak nahin he
 But the judiciary, under the power of interpretation of section 141, has taken it to mean that the collegium will appoint judges
 supreme court ke colegium main chif justise of india ke alaava chaar varisht jaj hote hai
 Before the Standing Committee, Justice MN Venkata Chelliah, Justice BR Krishna Iyer and Justice JS Verma had suggested that a National Judicial Commission should be formed so that the appointment in a transparent manner
 in jajon ne chintaa vyakt kii thi ki hai court ke jajon kii niyukti ke maamle main bahut zyada laubi hoti he
 Eligible individuals are often overlooked
 khwamkhah log katju sahab ke peeche pad gaye hai
 The judge has said such things before also
 laubi hoti he
 Lobbying has taken place
 magar kya vahi raajnneeti apane haath se is ghoshit aghoshit adhikaar kshetra ko jane degi
 After all, there should be no delay in the appointment of eight hundred judges of 24 High Court
 kya rashtriya nyaayik ayog behatar vikalp he
 When the five judges of the Supreme Court could not make a credible process together, then which such surkhab would have wings in the National Judicial Commission, where it would not be there
 hyderabad main 17 saal ke naaballig kii sandehaaspad maut ke silsile main police ne saat ladakon ko giraftaar kiya he
 Of these, three accused are adults and four are minors

 The police was about to perform the autopsy on the dead body from the tomb, when the truth came out
 
 
 pehle to police ladke kii maut ko sadak haadasa maanate hue file band kar chuki thi
 But when the deceased's father returned from Dubai, he asked his son's friends about the incident
 unhen ladakon kii baat par shaq hua to unhone police main isaki shikaayat kii
 Following the father's complaint, the police reopened the file and started the investigation
 isse pehle ki police kabr se shav nikaal kar ladke kaa postmortem karwaati, maktul ke ek dost police ko sari hakeekat bayaan kar di
 The police then detain all the boys seen in the video and start questioning them
 or tab ek harahungez sach saamne aata he
 a 17-year-old boy killed in sports, eight friends organized a wwe-style street fight on May 4
 wo aisa aksar karte the
 During this time, a boy was hurt in the game and died on the spot
 shav ko bike par baithaaya or ghatana ko diya sadak haadase kaa rangaphite main ladke kii maukey par hi maut ho gai
 Out of fear, the seven boys conspired to turn the incident into an accident
 unhone dost ke shav ko bike par bithkar sadak haadase kaa stage diya
 He then took a stab wound to the head of his deceased friend and took him to a nearby hospital
 vahaan doctor se kaha ki unke dost kaa bike se accident ho gaya he
 When the doctor also saw his friend, he declared him dead without any investigation
 ladakon ne wo mobile bhi tod kar phenk diya tha
 With which he made a video of this friendly fight
 unki nishandehi par police us jagah gai jahaan unhone mobile phenkaa tha
 Recovered that broken mobile
 iske baad police kii forensik team ne us toote hue mobise se haadase ke us video ke data ko ritreave kar liya
 In this way, the whole truth of death was revealed in the game

 bataaya ja rahaa he ki iske baad nagaraj ne karnataka ke purv mukhyamantri or congress netaa siddharmaiya se kaha ki wo apana istipha waapas le lenge or congress main bane rahenge
 On the other hand, the Supreme Court has asked Assembly Speaker KR Ramesh Kumar not to take any decision in the case

 This is also the reason for opposition from Congress

 Maulana Ghazi Wali Ulla Chishti, vice-president of Jamiat ulema-e-hind, has alleged conspiracy within the Samajwadi Party

 Jamiat said that since the way Azam Khan thwarted the Chaurasi Kosi Parikrama of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, a conspiracy is being hatched against him since then
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki is sabake peeche ashok singhl hai
 Significantly, when the Chaurasi Kosi Parikrama was not allowed by the Uttar Pradesh government, Singhal had blamed the head of Azam Khan

 Before the assembly elections in Rajasthan, there is a fierce battle in the BJP once again
 is baar purv uparashtrapati bhaerosingh shekhavat ke damaad or bijepi vidhayak narpat singh rajvi ne apni hi party ke netaaon ke khilaaf morcha khol diya he
 Rajvi has written in a letter to Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje that BJP leaders in Jaipur are indulging in corruption and looting the government's money
 rajvi ne chitthee main likhaa he ki bijepi shahar adhyaksh sanjay jain sarkari kaamon kaa theka lete hai or usamen gaban ho rahaa he
 Similarly, BJP leader and councilor Bhagwat Singh Deol has also been accused of grabbing money by taking government contract
 rajvi ne apni chitthee main ek-ek karke bijepi netaaon ko mili theke kaa vivaran diya he or kaha he ki nagar nigam main bijepi ke parshad se lekar neeche tak ke log theke lene main vyast hai aurasarkari paisalut rahe hai
 The chairman of the Motor Garage Committee has accused Bhagwat Singh Deval of taking contracts for cleaning the drains of the city but no work is being done
 rajvi ke aaropon kii fehrist kaaphi lambii he
 Rajvi has written in his letter that he has submitted a list of 23 illegal encroachments to the government but only three encroachments have been broken and the remaining people have been left with money
 rajvi kii chitthee se bijepi kii raajnneeti main ek baar phir se bhuuchaal aa gaya he
 However, Rajvi has made allegations against the BJP leaders who have rejected it
 bijepi shahar adhyaksh sanjay jain kaa kahana he ki vah kisi tarah ke theke main lipt nahin he jabaki bhagat bhagavat deol kaa kahana he ki is baar rajvi apana tikat katane se dare hue hai lihaaja is tarah ke aarope laga rahe hai
 What to say about politics and what to say about the leaders who do such politics? What has not happened in politics kya-kya nahin kiya gaya chunaav jeetne ke liye
 There were seizures, riots, fights, buying and selling and even the bullet was hit by bullets
 magar chunavi dariyaa paar karne ke vaaste hamadardi ko lahar banane ke liye koi netaa apane hi bhai or jija kii supaari dekar use marava de, soch se bhi pare kii cheez lagati he, par kya karen siyasat bhi to kisi jang se kam nahin
 All is fair in love and politics
 siyasat main adaavat puraani kahani he
 Politics is an old tradition in elections
 chunavi jeet main nafrat-mohabbat puraani daastaan he
 Gaining votes in the name of sympathy is an old tactic
 note ke badale vot puraani beemaari he, lekin khooni siyasat kii ye sabase nai kahani he
 By the way, the old saying is that everything is justified in love and war
 apane yahaan chunaav netaaon ke liye kisi bhi myne main jang se kam nahin he
 Therefore, following this thinking, a leader shot his own brother and brother-in-law to win a seat
 sirf is ummid or laalach main ki ghar main hui ye do maut hamadardi main lipat kar vot kii shakl main thok ke bhav iviem mashin main utrengi or wo vidhayak ban jayega
 Is it a completely new story of Siyasat? First won the ticket to contest elections and in this same fight, the loss of 1 crore 85 lakh
 phir karodon ke nuksaan ke chalate karz main funsane kii musiibat
 Despite the loss, the ticket is not compelled to join the other party
 phir aakhir main chunaav jeet kar apane nuksaan kii bharpai karne kaa torget
 Due to this target, his own brother and brother-in-law were killed
 satta chiz hi kuch aisi he
 The best are not able to control themselves
 puraane-jamaane main raaje-rajavaade hukumat kii bagdor apane haathon main thaamne ke liye sage-sambandhiyon kaa koon bahaya karte the
 Now new leaders of the new era are following the same path to win the election
 police hiraasat main maujuud ye janaab pashchimi uttar pradesh ke bulandshahr se rashtriya lokdal ke pratyaashee manoj gautam hai
 At this time, instead of walking around the public with folded hands, Netaji is holding in handcuffs among the policemen
 netaji par ilzaam he ki sahanubhuti kii lahar main chunaav jeetne ke liye inhone khud apane hi bhai or bahanoi kaa qatl karvaa diya
 Anyway, if there was only one proof, then maybe Netaji would have denied it, but here Netaji's henchmen got all the phone recordings done before Netaji's politeness shone
 vaise to qatl ke vaqt mauka e vaardaat par netaji ke mobile phone kii lokation apane-aap main unke karatuut kii chugali kha rahi thi
 But Netaji's henchmen completed the right task
 unhen khud netaji yani areldi ke ummidavaar manoj gautam ne apane bhai or bahanoi ko thikaane lagane kii supaari di thi
 But as shameful as this idea of riding across the electoral corridor on a kayak of sympathy, the intrigue behind it is equally as deep and shocking
 bulandshahr ke bageeche main jab do logon kii laashen mili to katl kaa ye maamla bilkul blind tha
 But soon those who died were identified
 kaatilon ke mobile phone kii lokation kii badaulat is dohare qatl kii saazish se pardaa hataa to har koi hairaan tha
 Was surprised on whether anyone can take the life of his brother and brother-in-law only to win the election? Two corpses lying under trees between Agwal village of Bulandshahr in UP and mango orchard in village
 chunavi maahaul main mangalvaar jaise hi gaanvvaalon kii nazar in laashon par padi, unhen ye samajhate der nahin lagi ki maamla qatl kaa he
 The bullet marks on both the corpses were clearly visible
 foran gaanvvaalon ne police ko ittila di or chand minuton main police bhi puure lashkar ke saath maukey par maujuud thi
 The corpses were sent for post-mortem
 police tafteesh shuru kar di gai
 But when the identity of the dead was revealed after the corpse was found in double murder, people got another shock
 maranevaale koi or nahin balki bulandshahr se rashtriya lok dal ke pratyaashee manoj gautam ke bhai vinod gautam or uske bahanoi sachin the
 But who killed these two before the election from Ann? What hostility did these brother-in-law have after all? Was the murder caused by electoral rivalry? There were many questions about this double murder
 police ke paas iskaa koi suraag nahin tha
 Therefore, the police decided to start the case with technical surveillance
 isi koshish main jaise hi raat ke andhere main police ne bageeche ke aas-paas maujuud mobile phone kaa data nikalvaaya, haqiqat dekh kar sabake kaan khadey ho gaye
 Yes, when Vinod and Sachin were killed in the garden, there were two people named Parminder and Firoz besides Manoj Gautam himself, RLD candidate and brother of Maktool Vinod Gautam
 manoj to ab tak police ko kuch or hi kahani suna rahaa tha
 Chance a was talking about getting away from the incident
 lekin jab is technical servilans ke subut ke boote police ne manoj or firoz ko hiraasat main lekar poochtacha shuru kii, to jald hi donon ne apnagunahakubul liya
 Manoj Gautam even told that he hoped that due to the murder of his own brother and his friend and brother-in-law Sachin, he would easily win the election
 kyonki gharavaalon kii maut ke baad log use hamadardi main vot dekar chunaav main shartiya jeet dilaa denge
 Manoj has been conspiring with BSP leaders behind this

 koi bhi pakistan or islam ko kamatar nahin kar rahaa, ham khud pakistan or islam kii chhavi dhoomil kar rahe hai
 We ourselves are responsible for tarnishing the image of Pakistan
 malala ne kaha ki yah na sirf mashaal khan kii antyeshti he, balki yah hamaare dharm kii bhi antyeshti he
 We have forgotten the teachings of Islam, which teaches us peace and patience
 unhone khan ko peet-peet kar maar daale jane kaa zikr karte hue kaha, agar ham ek duusare kii is tarah se jaan lete rahenge to koi bhi surakshit nahin bachegaa

 The incident of a mob beating up a man in Uttar Pradesh's Hapur district has raised serious questions about the functioning of the police
 hapur jile ke bachheda khurd gaanv main 18 june ko hui is ghatana main bheed ne ek or shaks kii bhi pitayee kii thi, jisaki aspataal ke isiu main haalat najuk bani hui he
 Two videos purportedly showing the mob attack in the name of cow protection also went viral on social media
 polisaki ore se darj exiaar main is puure prakaran ko roderej kii ghatana se jod kar dikhaaya gaya
 Both parties involved in the incident have rejected this police theory
 haadase ke gavaah 2 videohamale main kasim naam ke shaks keemautahui or aspataal main bhartee shaks kaa naam samiuddin he
 One of the two videos which appeared on social media shows that the mob is dragging the badly injured Qasim
 duusare video main dekha ja saktaa he ki samiuddin ko dhamkaate hue gokshi main shaamil hona kabool karne ke liye dabaav daalaa ja rahaa he
 a picture related to the same incident also came out in which some people are dragging Qasim by hand and foot and policemen are walking ahead of them
 police kii amanviyata ko dikhaane vaali ye tasviir viral hui to upi police ne apane aadhikarik twitor handle se maafee maangane main der nahin lagaai thi
 a copy of FIR filed by Hapur Police is available with India Today
 iske mutabik police kii ore se ghatana kii jaanch jari he
 Also, it has been claimed that the incident was caused by road rage after which an angry mob attacked Qasim
 police ke mutabik samiuddin kasim ko bachaane aayaa to us par bhi hamalaa kiya gaya
 These incidents are part of a larger conspiracy
 Kakasim's house is in a narrow lane in Pilkhuwa town of Hapur district
 kasim ke parivaar main patni or do bete hai
 Social workers and NGO members have come to Kasim's house and are assuring them to join the fight for justice
 jon dayaal or harsh mandar jaise saamaajik kaaryakarta hapur kii is ghatana ko kisi bade shadyantr kaa hissaa bataa rahe hai
 John Dayal says that a similar pattern in such killings from some parts of the country appears to be that it is part of a larger political conspiracy to divide the society through polarization
 harsh mandar kaa bhi aisa hi maananaa he
 His family is heartbroken by Kasim's death
 kasim ke donon bete nadeem or saleem ne 'aaj tak' se baatcheet main pita kii maut ko shadyantr kaa hi hissaa bataaya
 Salim said that his father used to run the family by buying and selling sheep and goats, but he never had any connection with Gokshi
 nadeem ke mutabik uske pita kasim har baar kii tarah 18 june ko bhi batcheda khurd gaanv main bakriyaan kharidne gaye the, lekin ek shadyantr ke tahat vahaan motorcycle ke jariye chota sa sadak haadasa karavaaya gaya
 Nadeem alleges that after the incident, his father Kasim was attacked by a mob in a systematic manner called in the name of cow protection
 kasim ke parivaar kaa aarope he ki bheed se zyada jimmedaar upi police he jisane naa samay rahete madad kii or naa hi aparaadhiyon par karrwai kii
 Qasim's neighbors believe that such incidents may affect the environment of social brotherhood
 75 saal ke bujurg abrahim ko lagata he ki ek shadyantr ke tahat kasim kii hatya kii gai
 At the same time, according to 28-year-old Feroze, India's social fabric is so strong that such incidents cannot affect social harmony

 Rakesh Sisodia's family is extremely upset with Hapur police
 45 varshiya rakesh sisodiya kii beti neha sisodiya kaa kahana he ki uske pita nirdosh hai or police ne farji mukademe main fansaaya he
 According to Neha, the police did not even put their hands on the accused
 neha or unki maa kaa aarope he ki kasim hameshaa kii tarah us din bhi is gaanv main gokshi ke liye hi aayaa tha
 The Sisodia family alleges that when the villagers came to know that Qasim had come for Gokshi, the crowd rushed to the farm, where cows and calves were found tied
 neha sawaal karti hai ki phir police ne unke pita ke khilaaf mukadmaa kyon darj kiya? neha kaa ye bhi aarope he ki kasim police ke aane tak thik thaak sthiti main tha or uski maut darasalpulice kii castadeemein hui
 The family of Samiuddin, who was injured in the shock, also considers Kasim to be the culprit of cow slaughter, rejecting the argument of the road rage lodged by the police in the FIR
 pados main rahane vaali mahilaon ne bhi sisodiya parivaar ke aaropon kaa samarthan kiya
 Bachheda is the home of Sameeuddin, a short distance away from Khurd village
 samiuddin kii aspataal main jahaan haalat najuk hai vahiin ghar par parivaar sadame main he
 Sameeuddin's son and daughter say that his father went to work in the field as usual
 vahaan jab bheed ne kasim par hamalaa kiya to kasim kii madad ke liye aage gaye the
 Samiuddin's son said that action is not being taken against those who spread terror in the name of cow protection, hence he is fearless
 baharhaal is tarah kii ghatnaayen jahaan samaaj ko hilaa detii hai vahiin kanoon ke rakhwalon kii kaaryastylee ko bhi sawaalon ke ghere main laati he
 There is no consensus among the parties related to the theory that the police are giving
 aise main bada sawaal ye ki police peediton ko insaaf dilaaegi to dilaaegi kaise? We will change the forces from which power has revolved

 The BJP, which has been in power in Madhya Pradesh for the last 15 years, is getting a tough fight with the Congress this time
 Exit Poll bhi bataa rahe hai ki is baar bijepi ko congress se kadi takkar mili he

 2013 ke chunaav main bijepi ko 165 or congress ko 58 siten mili thim
 If it is talked about vote share, then Congress can get 41 per cent votes in MP

 The strategic meeting of the Samajwadi Party against the EVM headed by Akhilesh Yadav was initially inconclusive
 janeshwar mishra trust main iviem ke khilaaf vipaksh ko gol band karne kii koshish ke baavjood bispi or congress donon ne is meeting se apni duuri banaakar rakhi
 Actually, the Samajwadi Party convened a meeting of the opposition on Saturday

 At the same time, the biggest debate was about evms

 Meeting on EVM issue, congress-bsp has formed a meeting with distance opposition, attempts to reach consensus on the ballot paper for Lok Sabha by-elections have failed
 loksabhaa ke upachunaav gorakhpur or phulpur main hone hai
 a strategy had to be chalked out for this as well, while the consensus on EVM is expected to be knocked on the door of the Election Commission
 haal hi main sampann hue gujarat chunaav or upi ke nikaay chunaav ke baad sapa ne iviem se chunaav par aapatti jaahir kii he

 Congress has also sent its consent letter on this meeting

 Janwadi Party President Sanjay Singh Chauhan also reached the trust
 is baithak main congress or basapa kaa koi pratinidhi shaamil nahin hua
 Actually, EVM may be the excuse, but the whole effort is to unite the opposition with this excuse

 kohli ne yah bhi kaha ki aswin ne anderson ko apshabd nahin kahe, balki unheen ke andaaj main jawaab diya
 Significantly, Indian captain Virat Kohli has scored 640 runs in four Tests in this series so far and is moving towards the record of more than 700 runs in the series and with his brilliant game, Team India is achieving successes
 gauratlab he ki bhartiya captain viraat kohli ne is siries main ab tak chaar test main 640 ran jutaaye hai or siries main 700 se adhik ranon ke record kii ore bad rahe hai or unke shandaar khel se team india safaltaaen hasil kar rahi he
 On Monday, there was an opportunity for budget in the Haryana Vidhan Sabha, but the news of the rebellion in the ruling BJP and the displeasure of the legislators in the Assembly more than the budget was covered all day
 pehali baar haryana main apane balboote par sarkaar banane vaali bhartiya janata party ke liye ab usee ke vidhayak hi musiibat banate ja rahe hai
 BJP has 46 mlas in Haryana Legislative Assembly and out of these 18 mlas are currently angry with State Leadership and CM
 in vidhayakon ko rewadi ke vidhayak randhir singh kapadivaas lead kar rahe hai or vidhayakon kaa kahana he ki sarkaar main inaki baat nahin suni jaati
 He is the chosen representative of the public and in such a situation, the pressure to get the work done by the public remains on him and that is why he has put his point in front of the CM
 agar unki maangon par amal nahin kiya gaya to ek baar phir wo apni aawaaj uthaaenge
 Unhappy with the CM, according to information received from mlas, these mlas are unhappy with the way CM Khattar works
 apane ilaake kaa agar koi bhi kaam karwaane ke liye ye siem khatter yaa phir afasaron se sifarish karte hai to inaki siforeeshon ko darkinar kar diya jaataa he
 For this reason, gradually these angry mlas are getting united and are continuously meeting against the government
 baghawat par pardaa daalane main lagi partyhalankiharyanake bijepi adhyaksh subhash baraala is puri baghawat par pardaa daalane main lage hai
 He said that there is no such resentment but the mlas want that they can work in the interest of the people of their area
 isiilie wo lagaataar siem se sampark main rahete hai or apni baat saamne rakh dete hai or aisa karne kaa adhikaar in sabhi vidhayakon ko he
 The Haryana BJP president denied any rebellion or leadership change
 siem ne maani andruni khatpat kii batvahin haryana ke siem manohar laal khatter ne ye maan liya ki party main sab kuch thik nahin he
 He said that if the unanimous leadership change order will be given by the high command, then they are ready for it
 unhen siem bhi sarvasammati se banaaya gaya tha or ab aage koi bhi faisla agar sarvasammati se liya jayega to wo iskaa swaagat karenge
 Appeals to remain silent till the UP election results are revealed that the party high command is also angry about the displeasure of its mlas who are angry with the party and these angry mlas have been asked to remain silent until the UP elections are over
 isi vajah se jo vidhayak kuch din pehle tak khulkar siem khatter or sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ke khilaaf bol rahe the, wo ab khamosh ho gaye hai, lekin ye aag abhi puri tarah se buji nahin he
 The Opposition has clearly attacked the government, this rebellion is going on in the BJP, this has given the opposition parties Indian National Lok Dal and Congress an opportunity to attack the BJP government
 indian neshnal lokdal ke adhyaksh ashok aroda or congress ke varisht netaa or purv mantri gita bhukkal ne bijepi kii haryana sarkaar par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki jab ye party apane vidhayakon kii nahin sunati to aam janata kii kya sunegi
 It is clear from the neglect of the legislators that this government is not a representative of the people, but a government bowing before the bureaucracy
 khamosh hai sarkaar ke mantriapani sarkaar main chal rahi baghawat ko lekar sarkaar ke mantri bhi khamosh hai or unki is khamoshi se saaf hota he ki haryana bijepi or sarkaar main sab kuch sahi nahin chal rahaa he
 When Haryana Minister Manish Grover was asked about the displeasure of the mlas, he said that you go and ask these questions to the CM
 vahiin ek or mantri om prakaash dhankhad jawaab dene kii bajaae lagaataar haryana vidhansabha main pesh kiye gaye bajet ke kaside padhate rahen
 Opportunity for the Aam Aadmi Party: The onslaught in the BJP government gave a good chance to the Aam Aadmi Party, which is trying to make a move in Haryana
 aam aadmi party ke haryana adhyaksh naveen jaihind ne daawa kiya ki bijepi ke naaraaz vidhayakon main se kai vidhayak aam aadmi party ke sampark main he or aane vaale dinon main haryana kii raajnneeti main ek bada ulatpher ho saktaa he
 The claims of the AAP were rejected by Anil Vij
 These claims of the Aam Aadmi Party have been rejected by the fire minister of the Khattar government, Anil Vij
 unhone kaha ki vidhayakon main koi naaraazgi nahin he, balki vidhayak chaahate hai ki unke ilaake ke kaam achche se ho isi vajah se wo apni baat khulkar siem ke saamne rakh rahe hai
 Vij said that the Aam Aadmi Party is a baseless party and that is why it keeps talking without any basis
 khatter ke liye ek badi chunautikul milakar haryana kii khatter sarkaar ke liye dohari mushkil khadi he
 On the one hand, the government is facing opposition from government employees, opposition parties and Jats on the road, while the rebellion of mlas within the government has also intensified
 aise main aane vaale dinon main is baghawat ko tham kar satta ko sucharu rup se chalaanaa haryana ke siem manohar laal khatter ke liye ek badi chunauti hogi
 Now the Chief Minister of Haryana has also claimed to open accounts of 100 per cent families under the Jan Dhan Yojana
 mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ne shuukravaar ko yah daawa kiya
 8 so far
 39 karod khateunhone bankeron kii ek baithak main kaha ki rajya ne jan dhan yojana ke tahat 48 lakh 57 hajaar 524 pariwaron ke khate khole hai
 Significantly, the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Shivraj Singh Chauhan had also made such a claim by releasing an advertisement recently
 haalanki jamini jaanch main yah daawa jhootha niklaa or phir sarkaar ko is par safai bhi deni padi
 Significantly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi introduced Jan Dhan Yojana on August 28
 haryana sarkaar kii ore se ek bayaan main kaha gaya ki 26 oktober ko jab khatter ne siem pad sambhala, us din tak rajya main 67 fisadi pariwaron ke hi bank khate the

 Two days after his cabinet resigned, Nepal Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai formed the new National Integration Government with 12 ministers from the main opposition parties being appointed

 If Rahul Gandhi's change continues in this way, then Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not miss the lack of a weak speaker from the opposition camp
 pradhanmantri jis tarah ke purnakalik rajaneta he unhen bhi man karata hi hoga ki koi saamne se gherta to ve bhi jawaab dete
 Till now, the Prime Minister was being surrounded by everyone
 lekin ab lagata he ki unhen gherne vaale taiyaar ho rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi led the Congress to become active, to be one of the Janata Parivar and to lead the CPM in the hands of Sitaram Yechury
 chunaav to nahin he magar ranneetiyon or naaron ko lekar dilachasp mukaable ke liye taiyaar rahiye
 The suit is Boot's government
 bade logon kii sarkaar he
 This is the same label as Narendra Modi used to hit the Congress in his election rallies and the Congress was not only brilliant, but also used to retreat
 rahul gandhi jis loksabhaa main kabhi kabhaar bolne ke liye mashhoor the lagata he ab bolne kii badanaami lene ke liye taiyaar hai
 When a leader speaks, the person on whom he speaks does not only test but also presents himself to the challenge
 aarope-pratyarope kii is prakriya main yaa to wo nikharata he yaa batooni hokar basi ho jaataa he
 In the coming days, there will be a lot of analysis of what Rahul has spoken in these two days
 kya bolaa isse zyada is baat kaa hoga ki kaise bolaa
 While speaking, is Rahul the first Rahul or is the Rahul after 56 days
 jis tarah 2014 main 56 eench kaa seenaa majboot netritv kaa prasthaan bindu ban gaya tha kahin usee tarah 56 din kii chuttee na ban jaae! Rahul Gandhi is different in the way Rahul Gandhi looked scattered during the Lok Sabha elections
 narendra modi thik kehete the ki koi gusse main bol rahaa he
 It is another matter that Narendra Modi himself used to speak in anger
 loksabhaa main rahul gandhi ne thodaa hansaaya or thodaa fansaaya bhi
 For the first time, he was taking on the BJP camps considered to be expert for speech
 unhen chakaane lage
 Well you are not the Prime Minister
 desh ke to hai hi par kya aapke nahin hai
 i said your Prime Minister, then why did you feel bad
 loksabhaa main rahul gandhi saamaanya hokar bol rahe the
 He took off the load of being Rahul on his own
 wo is chintaa se mukt lage ki bolte vakt virdohi khemaa soshal media par koun koun se latife bana rahaa hoga
 In this sense, Pappu of social media has really passed today! ek baat yaad rakhiyegaa
 Speaking is not always influenced by the style of speaking
 raajnneetik halaat bhi aapke bole hue ko takat dete hai
 Apart from this, the politician's own honesty also creates seriousness to speak
 loksabhaa main jab rahul gandhi ne kalavati vaala bhaashan diya tha tab bhi unki tarif hui thi
 People felt that though they speak less, there is a kind of political seriousness
 magar wo gambhirtha jaldi hi gaayab ho gai
 Rahul Gandhi became famous for not speaking
 unhone khud bhi is chhavi ko gadhane main kaaphi madad kii
 When the Lokpal was debated, the youth found Rahul Gandhi
 rahul gandhi loksabhaa main lokapal ko sanvaidhanik darja die jane kaa ek parchaa padhakar gaayab ho gaye
 This time too, it seemed that he is the same Rahul Gandhi who has run away from responsibility
 ab laute hai to unka imtahaan phir se sakht hone vaala he
 These speeches on Sunday and Monday in Rahul's life will become memorable only when he will move forward honestly about his policies
 congress ko ek vaikalpik aarthik niti kii raajnneeti kii taraf le jane kaa jokhim uthaa sakenge
 Otherwise, the general understanding of economic experts is that Congress BJP is one
 bas bijepi faisle lene ke maamle main tej sabit hone kaa daawa karti he
 In Indian politics, two big political opponents can become one in economic matters, what can be a big political accident
 kya rahul main congress ko bijepi se alag kar dene kaa nazariyaa he
 The art or style of speaking can be achieved in ten days, but the approach of moving on a different economic vision comes from deep thinking
 usase bhi kahin zyada gahari eemaandaaree se
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is at the center of politics right now
 unase hone vaali chook kaa laabh uthaakar rahul netaa bananaa chaahate hai yaa unke saamne nai raajnneeti kaa koi saahsee khaakaa khinchakar
 This will only happen when this politician takes himself on an honest path
 itnaa aasaan nahin he
 It will also require honest atonement
 kya rahul aisa kar paaenge
 Will he always go ahead by targeting Narendra Modi or will he also be ready to criticize himself? unhen narendra modi kaa shukriya adaa karnaa chahie
 Prime Minister Modi has given him a chance to become Rahul more than the Congress did not
 tippaniyan The speech in the rally and Parliament was done, will Rahul talk to the press now as usual leader
 vaise unke press se baat karne ko lekar main bahut utsahit nahin rahata hum
 This task is very easy while in opposition
 vipaksh ke dinon main kai netaa har din uplabdh rahete hai
 It seems that these are the most honest soldiers of democracy
 magar haal ke raajnneetik anubhav bataate hai ki satta main aate hi vahi rajaneta press se dur ho jaataa he
 At rallies, the media abuses and presses the questions before the press and confronts the supporters when asked questions to discredit the asker
 is paimaane par aap kisi bhi netaa kaa moolyankan kar sakate hai
 Therefore, if Rahul talks to the press, it is good and if you do not make the mistake of looking at the profile of journalists while talking, it is even better
 vaise mere paas unase poochne ke liye bahut kuch to nahin he, sivaay iske ki bolte hue kurte kii baanhen marodana kiske kehane par band kar diya! The kind of full-time politician that the Prime Minister is, he must have felt that if someone had surrounded him, he would have responded
 abhi tak pradhanmantri hi sabko ghere ja rahe the
 But now it seems that those who surround them are getting ready
 rahul gandhi ne netritv main congress kaa sakriy hona, janata parivaar kaa ek hona or sipiem kaa netritv seetaram yechuri ke haath main janaa
 There is no election, but be prepared for an interesting contest about strategies and slogans
 suut boot kii sarkaar he
 There is a government of big people
 yah vaisaa hi label he jaisaa narendra modi apni chunavi reliyon main congress par chaspaan karte the or congress laajawab hi nahin hoti, peeche bhi hat jaaya karti thi
 Rahul Gandhi, who was once famous for speaking occasionally, seems to be ready to take a slander
 netaa jab bolta he to jis par bolta he sirf uskaa hi itmahaan nahin hota balki khud ko bhi chunauti ke liye pesh karata he
 In this process of accusation, he either sparks or becomes talkative and stale
 aane vaale dinon main rahul ke in do dinon main boli gai baton kaa khub vishleshan hoga
 What he said will be more than how he spoke
 bolte vakt rahul kya pehle vaale rahul hai yaa 56 dinon ke baad vaale rahul hai
 Just as the 56-inch chest in 2014 became the departure point for a strong leadership, should not a 56-day holiday be made! loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan rahul gandhi jis tarah bikhare bikhare lag rahe the us lihaaz ye rahul gandhi alag hai
 Narendra Modi was right that someone is speaking in anger
 ye or baat he ki khud narendra modi bhi gusse main hi bolaa karte the
 In the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi laughed a little and implicated a little
 ve pehali baar vaakchaturaai ke liye maahir maane jane vaale bijepi khemon se loha le rahe the
 Started tricking them
 acha aapke pradhanmantri nahin hai
 You belong to the country, but are you not? maine aapke pradhanmantri kaha to aapako kyon bura lag gaya
 Rahul Gandhi was speaking as a general in the Lok Sabha
 apane upar se rahul hone kaa lod utaar diya tha
 He felt free from worrying about which jokes the opposing camp would be making on social media
 is lihaaz se soshal media kaa pappu aaj sachmuch paas ho gaya! Remember one thing
 bolnaa hameshaa bolne kii style se asardaar nahin hota he
 Political conditions also give strength to your spoken
 iske alaava rajaneta kii apni eemaandaaree bhi bolne ke prati gambhirtha paidaa karti he
 He was also praised when Rahul Gandhi gave a Kalawati speech in the Lok Sabha
 logon ko laga tha ki bhale kam bolte hai magar ek kism kii raajnneetik gambhirtha he
 But that seriousness soon disappeared
 rahul gandhi na bolne ke liye hi mashhoor ho gaye
 He himself greatly helped to create this image
 lokapal par jab bahes hui tab yuvaaon ne rahul gandhi ko dhundha tha
 Rahul Gandhi disappeared by reading a form of giving constitutional status to Lokpal in the Lok Sabha
 is baar bhi gaayab hue to laga ki ye vahi rahul gandhi hai jo zimmedaari se bhaagate rahe hai
 If we return now, their examination is going to be tough again
 rahul kii zindagi main ravivaar or somvaar ke ye bhaashan tabhi yaadgaar banenge jab ve apni nitiyon ko lekar eemaandaaree se aage badhenge
 Will be able to afford to move the Congress towards an alternative economic policy politics
 varna aarthik jaankaron kii aam samaj to yahi he ki congress bijepi ek hai
 Just BJP claims to be fast in decision making
 bhartiya raajnneeti main do bade raajnneetik virdohi aarthik maamle main ek ho jaaen isse badi raajnneetik durghatana kya ho sakati he
 Does Rahul have a view to separate the Congress from the BJP? bolne kii kala yaa style to das dinon main hasil kii ja sakati he magar alag aarthik drushti par chalane kaa nazariyaa gahari soch se aata he
 Much more sincerely than that
 pradhanmantri narendra modi is vakt raajnneeti ke centre main hai
 Rahul wants to become a leader by taking advantage of the lapse from him or by drawing a bold blueprint of new politics in front of him
 yah to tabhi hoga jab yah rajaneta khud ko eemaandaar raste par le jaayegaa
 not that easy
 iske liye eemaandaar praayshchit kii bhi zarurat hogi
 Will Rahul be able to do this? kya ve hameshaa narendra modi ko hi nishaanaa banaakar aage badhenge yaa khud kii aalochana ke liye bhi taiyaar honge
 He should thank Narendra Modi
 unhen rahul banane kaa mauka jitna congress ne nahin diya usase kahin zyada pradhanmantri modi ne diya he
 The comments raily or sansad main bhaashan to ho gaya, kya ab rahul saamaanya netaa kii tarah aae din press se baat karenge
 By the way, i am not very excited about talking to his press
 vipaksh main rahete hue yah kaam bahut aasaan he
 On the days of opposition many leaders are available every day
 aisa lagata he ki loktantr ke yahi sabase eemaandaar sipaahi hai
 But recent political experiences show that the same politician gets away from the press as soon as he comes to power
 reliyon main media ko gaali detaa he or press se sawaal pehle tay karne lagata he or sawaal puche jane par samarthakon ko bhida detaa he ki poochne vaale ko badnaam kar do
 On this scale you can evaluate any leader
 isliye rahul press se baat karen to acha or baat karte samay patrakaron kii profile dekhne kii galati na karen to or bhi acha
 By the way, i do not have much to ask them, except that whoever stopped speaking on the arm of the kurta stopped speaking! suut boot kii sarkaar he
 There is a government of big people
 yah vaisaa hi label he jaisaa narendra modi apni chunavi reliyon main congress par chaspaan karte the or congress laajawab hi nahin hoti, peeche bhi hat jaaya karti thi
 Rahul Gandhi, who was once famous for speaking occasionally, seems to be ready to take a slander

 What he said will be more than how he spoke
 bolte vakt rahul kya pehle vaale rahul hai yaa 56 dinon ke baad vaale rahul hai
 Just as the 56-inch chest in 2014 became the departure point for a strong leadership, should not a 56-day holiday be made! loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan rahul gandhi jis tarah bikhare bikhare lag rahe the us lihaaz ye rahul gandhi alag hai
 Narendra Modi was right that someone is speaking in anger
 ye or baat he ki khud narendra modi bhi gusse main hi bolaa karte the
 In the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi laughed a little and implicated a little
 ve pehali baar vaakchaturaai ke liye maahir maane jane vaale bijepi khemon se loha le rahe the
 Started tricking them
 acha aapke pradhanmantri nahin hai
 You belong to the country, but are you not? maine aapke pradhanmantri kaha to aapako kyon bura lag gaya
 Rahul Gandhi was speaking as a general in the Lok Sabha
 apane upar se rahul hone kaa lod utaar diya tha
 He felt free from worrying about which jokes the opposing camp would be making on social media
 is lihaaz se soshal media kaa pappu aaj sachmuch paas ho gaya! Remember one thing
 bolnaa hameshaa bolne kii style se asardaar nahin hota he
 Political conditions also give strength to your spoken
 iske alaava rajaneta kii apni eemaandaaree bhi bolne ke prati gambhirtha paidaa karti he
 He was also praised when Rahul Gandhi gave a Kalawati speech in the Lok Sabha
 logon ko laga tha ki bhale kam bolte hai magar ek kism kii raajnneetik gambhirtha he
 But that seriousness soon disappeared
 rahul gandhi na bolne ke liye hi mashhoor ho gaye
 He himself greatly helped to create this image
 lokapal par jab bahes hui tab yuvaaon ne rahul gandhi ko dhundha tha
 Rahul Gandhi disappeared by reading a form of giving constitutional status to Lokpal in the Lok Sabha
 is baar bhi gaayab hue to laga ki ye vahi rahul gandhi hai jo zimmedaari se bhaagate rahe hai
 If we return now, their examination is going to be tough again
 rahul kii zindagi main ravivaar or somvaar ke ye bhaashan tabhi yaadgaar banenge jab ve apni nitiyon ko lekar eemaandaaree se aage badhenge
 Will be able to afford to move the Congress towards an alternative economic policy politics
 varna aarthik jaankaron kii aam samaj to yahi he ki congress bijepi ek hai
 Just BJP claims to be fast in decision making
 bhartiya raajnneeti main do bade raajnneetik virdohi aarthik maamle main ek ho jaaen isse badi raajnneetik durghatana kya ho sakati he
 Does Rahul have a view to separate the Congress from the BJP? bolne kii kala yaa style to das dinon main hasil kii ja sakati he magar alag aarthik drushti par chalane kaa nazariyaa gahari soch se aata he
 Much more sincerely than that
 pradhanmantri narendra modi is vakt raajnneeti ke centre main hai
 Rahul wants to become a leader by taking advantage of the lapse from him or by drawing a bold blueprint of new politics in front of him
 yah to tabhi hoga jab yah rajaneta khud ko eemaandaar raste par le jaayegaa
 not that easy
 iske liye eemaandaar praayshchit kii bhi zarurat hogi
 Will Rahul be able to do this? kya ve hameshaa narendra modi ko hi nishaanaa banaakar aage badhenge yaa khud kii aalochana ke liye bhi taiyaar honge
 He should thank Narendra Modi
 unhen rahul banane kaa mauka jitna congress ne nahin diya usase kahin zyada pradhanmantri modi ne diya he
 The comments raily or sansad main bhaashan to ho gaya, kya ab rahul saamaanya netaa kii tarah aae din press se baat karenge
 By the way, i am not very excited about talking to his press
 vipaksh main rahete hue yah kaam bahut aasaan he
 On the days of opposition many leaders are available every day
 aisa lagata he ki loktantr ke yahi sabase eemaandaar sipaahi hai
 But recent political experiences show that the same politician gets away from the press as soon as he comes to power
 reliyon main media ko gaali detaa he or press se sawaal pehle tay karne lagata he or sawaal puche jane par samarthakon ko bhida detaa he ki poochne vaale ko badnaam kar do
 On this scale you can evaluate any leader
 isliye rahul press se baat karen to acha or baat karte samay patrakaron kii profile dekhne kii galati na karen to or bhi acha
 By the way, i do not have much to ask them, except that whoever stopped speaking on the arm of the kurta stopped speaking! aane vaale dinon main rahul ke in do dinon main boli gai baton kaa khub vishleshan hoga
 What he said will be more than how he spoke
 bolte vakt rahul kya pehle vaale rahul hai yaa 56 dinon ke baad vaale rahul hai
 Just as the 56-inch chest in 2014 became the departure point for a strong leadership, should not a 56-day holiday be made! loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan rahul gandhi jis tarah bikhare bikhare lag rahe the us lihaaz ye rahul gandhi alag hai
