 (from input language) janalokapal bill ko lekar dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kii musiibat badhati ja rahi he
 Arvind Kejriwal had said about the bill that it is not unconstitutional and the opinion of 4 constitution experts has been taken on it
 lekin 2 visheshgyon ne isse inkaar kiya he
 The names of KN Bhatt and Pinaki Mishra are coming out
 inaki maane, to inase khaas janalokapal par koi raay nahin lee gai he, balki baaki duusare kai muddon par baat hui
 The other 2 lawyers are Mukul Mudgal and PV Kapoor
 darasal, kejariwal ne apni chitthee main kanoon ke chaar jaankaron kaa hawala diya he
 Kejriwal wrote that law experts had told that Delhi does not need the Centre's approval for Jan Lokpal
 lekin kanoon ke jin jaankaron kaa hawala kejariwal de rahe hai, unase janalokapal ke bare main nahin poocha gaya tha, balki yah poocha gaya tha ki kya dilli apni marji se kanoon bana sakati he yaa nahin
 Earlier, Lieutenant Governor of Delhi Najeeb Jung had sought solicitor general Mohan Parasharan's opinion on Janlokpal
 sutron ke mutabik, solicytor general ne najeeb jang ko bataaya ki bina centre sarkaar kii manzuri ke dilli sarkaar kaa janalokapal lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa

 Kapil Sibal has attacked the Aam Aadmi Party strongly
 unhone kaha he ki AAP ko sarkaar chalaanaa nahin aata
 This is the reason why she is trying to accuse others
 udhar, BJP ne kaha he solicytor general kii raay ne aam aadmi party ko benakaab kar diya he
 However, under the pretext of Kejriwal's Jan Lokpal, the politics in Delhi and in the country is yet to boil

 com / kf8mgzjgay— eng-dalia Orabi (@dalia_orabi)september 19, 2014 After the death of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Sabzar Bhatt, there seems to be a mutual rivalry among the Hizbul Mujahideen
 zakir musa or hijbul mujahiddeen ke netritv ke bich sabakuch thik nahin chal rahaa he
 During the encounter with Sabzar Bhatt, Indian intelligence agencies notice these things, which makes it clear that the Mujahideen is burning in the fire of mutual rivalry
 burhan vaani ke uttaradhikari kahe jane vaale sabajaar bhatta ke encounter ke baad se hi hijbul mujahiddeen main aisi baaten chal rahi hai ki kya jakir musa ne sabajaar bhatta ko dhokhaa diya he
 The Hizbul militants suspect that the location of Sabzar was detected by the Jammu and Kashmir Police from a personal messenger close to Zakir Musa, which helped the police in the encounter
 haalanki abhi kisi bhi agency kii ore se is baat kii pushti nahin kii gai he
 Let me tell you that Sabzar Bhatt was killed in Tral only last week
 haal hi main jari kiya tha audiohal hi main hijbul kii ore se ek audio clip bheja gaya tha jisamen kaha gaya he ki kashmir main chal rahaa 'andolan' islamic he na ki raajnneetik
 This audio clip has raised questions as to whether the Hurriyat has lost its relevance in Kashmir as the terrorists have rejected their politics
 burhan bani kii jagah hijbul ke commander bane jakir musa ne hurriyat netaaon se saaf-saaf kaha he ki wo unki qurbaani par raajnneeti na karen
 UJC wants to get Moses dead
 Ever since this incident, there were voices against Moses
 hijbul chif saiyad salauddin or pakistani army isse vaakye se khafa the
 It is under his leadership that the United Jihad Council organization is run
 khufia vibhaag ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik to coucil chahta he ki musa ko jald se jald khatm kiya jaae taaki uske lakshya main koi rukaawat naa aa paye
 It is clear that the ISI sitting in Pakistan does not want the terrorists sitting in Kashmir to manage everything, only then they want it
 musa is baat se khush nahin tha ki sabajaar ko hijbul kaa commander banaaya gaya he, jiske baad usne yah audio share kiya tha
 After Sabzar's death, 29-year-old Riyaz Nayaku, who is known as an technology expert, has been given his responsibility
 hijbul ko ummid he ki riyaj uske logon ko hijbul ke lakshya se bhatakane nahin degaa
 Also because Riyaz understands the technology quite well so that the youth will connect with his organization

 23 saal kii para medical chaatra ke saath chalati bas main 6 darindon ne milakar gangrape kiya or haivaaniyat kii sari hadon ko paar kar diya tha
 In this case, the verdict will come against the four convicts at 2:30 in the afternoon
 chaaron darindon mukesh, vinay, akshay or pawan ko saket court laayaa ja chukaa he
 The debate on the sentence was completed on Wednesday and the judge reserved the verdict
 aaj to bas in doshiyon ko sajaa sunaani baaki he
 It is being told that it will not take more than five minutes to announce the sentence
 chaaron ke liye faansee kii maangadilli police ne chaaron aaropee ke liye faansee kii sajaa kii maang kii he
 While defense lawyers are trying to get life imprisonment instead of hanging
 doshi pawan ke vakil ne kaha ki wo sirf 19 saal kaa he or use sudhara ja saktaa he isliye court unase narmi barte
 This is the mother of the country's most disgusting criminal victim 'jyoti', demanded the death penalty for the convicts, Jyoti's mother, who was a victim of gang rape on the night of 16 December last year in Delhi
 jyoti kii maa ne kaha, 'in logon ne jyoti ke saath jaisi haivaaniyat kii, uski sajaa faansee se kam nahin honi chahie
 'all the family members of Jyoti are also demanding the death penalty

 There are various sections like rape, murder, trying to erase evidence, criminal conspiracy, in which the culprits can be punished even to death
 doshiyon ko sajaa sunaate vakt court ne kaha tha ki 16 disambar kii raat jo bhi hua wo achaanak nahin hua balki sochi samajhi sajeesh kaa nateeja tha
 Forgive new age children, forgive me: After the defense debate is over, the rapist lawyer AP Singh said while talking to the media, "the government lawyer has sought execution, but we defense lawyers say That they are new age children
 agar unhone koi jurm kiya bhi he to unhen ek mauka diya janaa chahie
 Earlier, during the arguments, the lawyers of the convicts argued that the death penalty is a violation of fundamental rights and in such cases only life sentence is given
 unhone bhaavnaatmak aadhaar par bhi doshiyon ke liye kam sajaa kii maang kii
 He said that all the culprits are below 30 years of age, they are from poor families and families are dependent on them, so they should not be sentenced to be hanged
 akshay thakur ke vakil ne kaha ki unka muvakkil abhi 19 saal kaa he, isliye uske sudharne kii ummid he
 At the same time, it has been argued in favor of Mukesh that even though he is driving the bus, it does not mean that he has done the crime
 padhein-dilli gangrape: jaane, puraa ghatnakrandalat ne mangalvaar ko mukesh singh, pawan gupta, vinay sharma or akshay thakur ko 13 dhaaraon main doshi qaraar diya tha
 If found guilty under these sections there is a minimum life sentence
 agar adaalat maamle ko 'reerest of rer' maanati he to doshiyon ko faansee kii sajaa bhi sunai ja sakati he

 madhya pradesh sarkaar ne bhale hi tambaaku yukt gutkhon ke utpaadan or bikri par purna pratibandh laga diya ho, lekin uttar pradesh va chhattisgarh main nirmit gutkhe simavarti aadha darjan jilon ke shahari evam gramin kshetron main dhadlle se bik rahe hai or vah bhi dogune-tigune daamon par
 The Shivraj Singh Chauhan government imposed a complete ban on the production and sale of tobacco-containing gutkha a few months ago
 pratibandh se bhale hi is pradesh main gutkhon kaa utpaadan band ho gaya ho, lekin bikri par abhi bhi roak nahin lag pai he
 The sale of these tobacco-containing gutkha in urban and rural areas of Rewa, Satna, Jabalpur, Panna, Chhatarpur and Tikamgarh, bordering districts of Madhya Pradesh adjoining Uttar Pradesh, continues unabated
 madhya pradesh main ek darjan gutkha utpaadon kii thok or footkar bikri choti-badi dukaanon se saream ho rahi he or inamen kuch aise utpaada bhi hai jinamein panjiyan tithi or sankhya kaa ullekh nahin he
 Yes, the statutory warning is 'tobacco is fatal'
 paauch par mulya ek rupaya darj he, par dukandaar ise kuch sthanon par do rupee main to kuch sthanon par teen rupee main bhi bech rahe hai
 Satyendra Badgaiyan, a retail businessman from Gopal Bagh, a neighborhood near Neeraj Talkies in Katni, said, “jarda wala gutkha buys wholesalers from Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and makes them available to retail shoppers at high prices
 ' niraj takies ke bagal main paan kii gumti chalaane vaale ashok tiwari bataate hai ki nashe ke aadi log doguni-tiguni keemten dekar bhi ise kha rahe hai
 Shehzad, who runs an auto rickshaw near Katni railway station, says the ban imposed on the production and sale of gutkha has little effect
 keval utpaadan band he or bikri purv kii bhaanti hi ho rahi he
 Katni Superintendent of Police Amit Sanghi says, "there may be some traders or shopkeepers selling tobacco-containing gutkha, but no one has filed a police complaint yet
 ' aisa nahin he ki gutkhon ko lekar yah sthiti sirf katni main hi he
 More or less, the sale of gutkas continues in the entire state, keeping the government order, and the administration has no choice but to cry out the compulsions
 chunaav main dharm ke istemaal par supreme court main ahm sunwaayee chal rahi he
 'hindutva is not a religion but a lifestyle', after two decades the Supreme Court has started rethinking the decision
 supreme court ke 7 sadasyon kii samvidhan peeth is mudde or isse jude vibhinn pahaluon par gaur kar rahi he, jaise ki kya dharm (hindutv samet) ko chunavi lamabandi ke dauraan istemaal kiya ja saktaa he yaa isse bachaa ja saktaa he? supreme court main is maamle par buudhvaar ko bhi sunwaayee jari rahegi
 What was the court's decision in 1995? Let me tell you that in December 1995, a three-member bench of the Supreme Court ruled that the use of Hindutva in elections is not wrong as Hindutva is not a religion but a way of life
 justise jees verma kii aguai vaali bench ne yah faisla diya tha
 The court had said, 'the word Hindutva refers to the way of life of the Indian people
 ise sirf un logon tak simit nahin kiya ja saktaa, jo apni aasthaa kii vajah se hindu dharm ko maanate hai
 'under this judgment, the Court refused to consider the use of Hindutva as a religion under Section 123 of the Representation of the People Act as' corrupt activity'
 2014 main cese supreme court kii 7 jajon kii peeth ko saunpa gaya1995 ke faisle ke baad isi mudde par kai yachikaayen supreme court kii samvidhan peeth ke saamne ai
 a five-judge bench referred the matter to a seven-judge bench in 2014
 mangalvaar ko ek yachikakarta abhiram ke vakil ne supreme court ke saamne apni daleel rakhin
 Some of the questions that the Supreme Court may consider in the next few days are -1
 kayaa ek ummidavaar apane dharm ke naam par vot maang saktaa he?2
 Can any other person ask for votes for a particular candidate in the name of his / her religion? 3
 kya koi ummidavaar duusare dharm ke logon se apane liye vot maang saktaa he, is vaade ke saath ki wo us dharm / samudaay ke logon ko madad karegaa?4
 Can any other person appeal to a particular community or ask them to vote for a candidate who belongs to another community or religion? ek ore jahaan desh main aazaadee kaa jashn manaaya gaya, vahiin england ke khilaaf siries ke aakhri match main bhi team india ke ballebaajon kii besharmi jari rahi

 bharat kii ore se eshanth sharma, bhubaneshwar kumaar, varun eron or stuart binni koi bhi gendbaaj in do ballebaajon ko pareshaan nahin kar sakaa
 It was expected that on the occasion of Independence Day, Team India would give some good gift to the Indian cricket fans, but the English bowlers shattered all such hopes
 captain kool emes dhoni ko chhodkar koi bhi ballebaaj english gendbaajon ke saamne tik nahin sakaa
 Amid the fall of wickets, Dhoni studded the 33rd Fifty of Test cricket
 dhoni 82 ran banaakar out hone vaale aakhri ballebaaj rahe, jabaki eshanth sharma 7 ran banaakar naabad laute
 Dhoni has equaled a unique record by rooted in Pachasa

 Dhoni has rooted 8 Pachasas in England so far
 australia ke eme nobel ne bhi bina shatak jade 8 hafcenturi banaai hai

 trainon main kambalon ke gande hone kii shikayaton se pareshaan bhartiya railway ne unke zyada baar dhulane or maujuuda kambalon ko charanbaddh tareeke se diziner evam halke kambalon se badalane ke liye ek kaaryayojna taiyaar kii he
 In addition, the used blankets will be cleaned regularly before being used again
 udhar kuch media khabaron main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki railway kambal kaa istemaal hi band karne kii yojana bana rahaa he
 The blankets are washed once every six months
 There is a directive to wash the blankets within every one or two months, but a recent CAG report stated that the blankets here had not been washed for six months
 haalanki, ab jald hi trainon main badboodaar kambal gujarey samay kii baat ho sakate hai
 The Railways has tasked the National Institute of Fashion Design NIFT to make light blankets with low wool

 Saffronist Yogi Adityanath is an MP from Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh
 loksabhaa chunaav main unhone lagaataar paanch baar jeet darj kii he
 But Adityanath does not get votes only in the name of development, in fact his politics follows the formula of inciting communal sentiments
 yogi ji ek baar phir apane puraane formule par hai
 He and his statements are discussed at every intersection from the political corridors
 yogi adityanath biessi paas hai
 Has been a MP since the age of 26
 paanchavin baar sansad pahunche hai, lekin unki is chamatkaari jeet ke peeche unka kattar hindutv kaa agenda he
 An agenda with which his strength continued to grow
 itani ki aakhirkaar gorakhpur main jo yogi kahe vahi niyam he, vahi kanoon he
 That is why his supporters also raise the slogan, 'if you want to live in Gorakhpur, you have to say yogi-yogi
 '1998 main shuru hui raajnneetik pariyogi adityanath kaa asli naam he ajay singh
 He is originally from Uttarakhand
 gadhwal uniwarsity se unhone biessi kii padhai kii
 Mahant Avaidyanath of Gorakhnath temple had initiated him and made him a yogi
 avaidhyanath ne 1998 main raajnneeti se sanyas liya or yogi adityanath ko apana uttaradhikari ghoshit kar diya
 This is where Yogi Adityanath's political innings started
 1998 main gorakhpur se 12veen loksabhaa kaa chunaav jitkar yogi adityanath sansad pahunche to vah sabase kam umr ke saansad the
 Formation of Hindu Yuva Vahini: As soon as the politics came into the field of politics, Yogi Adityanath also grabbed the second stage of politics
 unhone hindu yuva vahini kaa gathan kiya or dharm parivartan ke khilaaf muhim ched di
 He made controversial statements several times while walking on the path of staunch Hindutva
 yogi vivaadon main bane rahe, lekin unki takat lagaataar badhati gai
 In 2007, when there were riots in Gorakhpur, Yogi Adityanath was made the main accused
 giraftaar hui or is par koharaam bhi machaa
 Many criminal cases were also registered against Yogi
 ab tak yogi adityanath kii haisiyat aisi ban gai ki jahaan wo khadey hote, sabha shuru ho jaati
 What he used to say would have become law for his supporters
 yahi nahin, holi or deepawali jaise tyohaar kab manaaya jaae, iske liye bhi yogi adityanath gorakhnath mandir se farmaan jari karte hai isliye gorakhpur main hiduon ke tyohaar ek din baad manaae jate hai
 Urdu became Hindi, Mian changed Mayayogi Adityanath's modalities can be gauged from the fact that he changed the names of many historical neighborhoods of Gorakhpur
 iske tahat urdu bazaar hindi bazaar ban gaya
 Ali Nagar became Aryanagar
 miyaan bazaar maaya bazaar ho gaya
 Not only this, Yogi Adityanath also wants to change the name of Azamgarh
 iske peeche adityanath kaa tark he ki desh kii pahchaan hindi se he urdu se nahin, arya se he ali se nahin
 In Gorakhpur and the surrounding area, Yogi Adityanath and his Hindu Yuva Vahini speak
 bijepi main bhi unki jabardast dhak he
 The proof of this is that the BJP had provided helicopters to Yogi Adityanath for campaigning in the last Lok Sabha elections
 2007 main gorakhpur main dange hue the, jinamein yogi ke daaman par gahare daag lage the
 But since then Yogi Adityanath's strength grew and he became the self-styled monastery of Hindutva

 In the second position, along with Congress, Alpesh Thakor, Jignesh Mevani and Hardik Patel are also included
 survey ke mutabik, hardik patel ke saath aane par congress ko thodi badhat mil rahi he lekin vah bhi rajya kii satta dilaa paane main kaaphi nahin najar aa rahi
 The BJP does not seem to be running away from power even after 22 years in both the cases
 mjedaar baat he ki donon hi sthitiyon main bijepi ko congress se doguni siten milti najar aa rahi hai
 That is, the Congress's best efforts can once again be dusty

 There is no need to worry for him
 satta main aane ke liye jaruri jaadui aankade ke paar bijepi tab bhi khadi najar aa rahi he
 In the second case, BJP is getting 110 to 120 seats only
 jabaki congress ko is sthiti main kuch siton kii badhat ke saath 62 se 71 siton par santosh karnaa pad saktaa he
 Other parties are expected to get 0 to 3 seats in this situation too

 centre kii modi sarkaar ne ek bada faisla lete huehaj yatra par di jane vaali sabsidikhatm kar di he
 This year approximately one lakh two lakh people will go on Haj pilgrimage but they will not get the benefit of subsidy
 darasal ye ek aisa faisla he jisaki maang muslim tabake se hi samay samay par uthati rahi he
 Leaders such as AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi, Kamal Farooqui have advocated the abolition of Haj subsidy several times
 hawaii yatra par sabsididrasal,haj yatriyonko milane vaali sabsidi kaa sabase bada hissaa hawaii yatra par kharch kiya jaataa he
 The Ministry of Civil Aviation, Government of India provides these subsidies through the Haj Committee of India
 ye paisa haj yatriyon ke bajaay air india ko sidhe diya jaataa he
 It is also worth noting that this exemption in the name of Haj pilgrims is provided only for those Haj pilgrims who are registered in Haj Committee of India (hcoi) and go to Saudi for Haj
 jabaki privet tour operators (ptos) ke jariye jane vaale haj yatriyon ko iskaa laabh nahin miltaa he
 Under the new policy, 70 percent of the passengers through the Haj Committee and 30 percent of the passengers will be able to go on Haj pilgrimage through private operators
 muslimon kii behatari ke liye kadangle paanch saal ke liye haj niti tay karne ke liye bani ucch stareey cameti ke sadsy kamaal faruki ne kaha ki sarkaar ne haj sabsidi ko khatm karke musalamaanon ke liye behatar kadam kadam uthaaya he
 Air India was being benefited from Haj subsidy instead of Muslims
 unhone kaha ki jis tarah se centre sarkaar ne haj sabsidi ko khatm karne ke liye kadam uthaaya he, usee tarah duusare dharmon kii yatra ke liye sarkaar dwaara di jane vaali sabsidi ko bhi khatm kare
 Farooqui said that the government has accepted all the demands that we had put before the government in the Haj policies
 desh kaa musalmaan ab puri tarah se aaazaad hai ki wo kisi bhi flite se haj se liye jaaen or apni suvidha ke anusaar airport se jaae
 AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi has also demanded an end to the Haj subsidy
 unhone pichley saal hi ajtak se baatcheet main kaha tha ki haj sabsidi ko khatm kar uskaa paisa muslim girls ajukeshan par laganaa chahie
 Owaisi said that this will progress him and whoever has to go for Haj will definitely go
 haj sabsidi dene kaa koi phayda nahin he
 Since only the airlines benefit from it and other people benefit from it
 unhone kaha ki pichley 10 varshon se vah is baat ko sansad main uthaa rahe hai
 The government spends this much, according to a figure, in 2012, Rs 836 crore was spent on subsidy, while in 2013, 680 crore was given as subsidy
 2014 main ye or kam hokar 533 karod pahunch gaya
 In fact, in 2010, the Ministry of External Affairs had proposed a proposal to reduce the subsidy by 10 percent every year
 jiske baad se lagaataar haj sabsidi main katautee kii ja rahi he
 Haj pilgrims apply to the Haj Committee of India
 iske liye unhen aavedan kii fees bhi jamaa kerani hoti he
 The Haj Committee assigns to the government a list of passengers going to Tehj under its quota, which is shared with the airlines
 ek haj yatri ke liye haj cameti kareeb 25 hajaar rupee kharch karti he
 Whereas the air travel cost of a Haj pilgrims going with the help of private tour operators is much more
 is saal privet operators ke jariye haj par jane vaale ek yatri kaa kharch kareeb 70 hajaar rupee aayaa he
 Whereas the traveler who goes by Haj Committee has incurred the same expenditure of Rs 25 thousand
 ye donon raashi saudi arab jane vaale aam yatri se bhi zyada hoti he
 However, these expenses are also different from different places
 aaj 'world dance de' he or aise main kai logon ne apane dance ke jazbe kaa rielity chack kiya

 Whatever major scams have happened in Noida, Greater Noida or Yamuna Expressway Authority, Rama Raman's chair remains intact
 yadav singh kii bahaali main ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaale is afasar ke khilaaf aaj tak koi karrwai nahin hui he
 The court ruled that the transfer order is actually IAS officer Rama Raman Akale is not the first such officer
 jo noida, greater noida ke lambey samay tak chairman va siio rahe hon
 The tenures of Brajesh Kumar and Mohinder Singh also lasted for four to five years
 basapa shashan kaal main lalit shrivastav bhi do baar main saadhe teen saal tak chairman or siio rahe the
 Noida Authority was established on 17 April 1976, while Greater Noida was established on 28 January 1991 and Yamuna Authority on 24 April 2001
 sthapana ke vakt se teenon praadhikaran ke siio alag-alag rahe hai, lekin chairman ek hi rahaa he
 HC banned Rama Raman's work, in fact, IAS Rama Raman has been given a big blow by Allahabad High Court
 noida, greater noida or yamuna express-ve atharity ke mukhya karypalak adhikari kaa pad sambhaal rahe iees rama raman par shuukravaar ko court kii gaaj giri
 The Allahabad High Court has barred him from working as CEO
 yahi nahin, elahabaad hai court ne apane sakht nirdesh main rama raman ke adhikaar jabt karne ke bhi aadesh die hai
 Apart from this, the state government has been ordered to transfer them within two weeks
 hai court ne yah bhi kaha he ki pradesh sarkaar ko rama raman kaa tabadalaa gautam buddha jile se baahar karnaa hoga
 According to the decision on the petition of a social activist, Rama Raman was posted for a long time as the chairman of Greater Noida and Yamuna Authority

 Please tell that the High Court had earlier also raised questions about the appointment of Rama Raman in the Authority
 tab court ne sarkaar se poocha tha ki aakhir sarkaar kii rama raman kii tainaati ke peeche kya majaburi he, vah itane saalon se praadhikaran main kyon tainaat hai
 The magic of Rama Raman on Mayawati also is that whether it is Mayawati government or Akhilesh Yadav government, the magic of IAS Rama Raman always works on everyone
 noida, greater noida yaa phir yamuna express-ve praadhikaran main chaahe jitne bhi bade ghotaale hue ho, lekin rama raman kii kursi barkaraar rahi

 However, this time his tenure was around eight months
 tabadalaa nahin hone se court ne poocha sawalnoida, greater noida va yamuna praadhikaran ke chairman rahe rakesh bahadur or noida ke siio sanjeev saran ko bhi court ke hastkshep se pad se hatana padaa tha
 Both the officials were accused of disturbing the hotel allocation in Noida
 saal 2007 main basapa ke satta main aane ke baad donon ko nilambit kiya gaya tha
 After this, when the SP came to power in the state in 2012, the suspension of both was ended
 donon adhikariyon kii tainaati dobaaraa noida or greater noida main kii gai thi, jiske khilaaf hoicourt main janhit yachika bhi daali gai
 Apart from this, no officer could complete his two-year term
 lambey vakt tak ye bhi pad par the tainaatarama raman 2009 main greater noida athurity ke siio bane the
 Then in 2011, he became the chairman of Greater Noida, Noida and Yamuna Expressway Authority
 iees adhikari rama raman akele aise pehle afasar nahin hai, jo noida, greater noida ke lambey samay tak chairman va siio rahe hon
 The tenures of Brajesh Kumar and Mohinder Singh also lasted for four to five years
 basapa shashan kaal main lalit shrivastav 2001 se 2003 or 2007 se 2009 ke ant tak greater noida or yamuna praadhikaran ke siio or chairman evam noida praadhikaran ke chairman rahe

 inaki hui jaldi chutteeiske alaava teenon praadhikaranon main koi adhikari aisa nahin rahaa, jisane do saal kaa kaarykaal bhi puraa kiya ho
 Most ceos and chairmen were discharged within a year
 noida, greater noida or yamuna praadhikaran main aise bhi anek afasar rahe, jo chah maah kaa kaarykaal bhi puraa na kar sake
 But Yogesh Kumar, Gangaram Barua, Dinesh Singh and Manoj Kumar Singh were removed from the post within one to three months
 athurity main karodon ke ghotalob sawaal uthta he ki aakhir ek hi adhikari ko teenon praadhikaranon kaa mukhiya kyon banaaya gaya jabaki atharity main karodon ke kai ghotaale hai
 IAS Rama Raman has been holding the post of CEO of these three authorities for 6 years
 is bich praadhikaranon main tamaam ghotaale saamne aane ke baad bhi unhen nahin hataaya gaya
 The court said that despite having many qualified officers, the same officer as CEO of three authorities raises many questions
 mukhya sachiv ko aadesh diya gaya he ki unki adhyakshata main gathit cameti do maheene ke bheetar rama raman ke tabadale par faisla le

 Tapas's statement against women was described by the court as 'outrageous' and surpassed all limits of civilization

 The Supreme Court has reserved its decision on the petitions filed against the delay in the appointment of Lokpal
 is maamle main 7 janhit yachikaayen daayar hui hai, jinamein maang kii gai he ki court sarkaar ko lokapal niyukt karne kaa nirdesh de
 During a hearing that lasted for nearly two hours on Tuesday, senior advocate Shanti Bhushan, on behalf of a petitioner Common Cause, accused the government of deliberately delaying the appointment of Lokpal
 jald ho lokapal kii niyuktishanti bhushan ne kaha ki sarkaar kii niyat saaf nahin he or wo niyukti karnaa hi nahin chaahati he
 The matter should be kept pending in the Supreme Court so that the Supreme Court can monitor the case
 is desh main kanoon kaa raaj khatm ho gaya he
 One petitioner said that the leader of the largest opposition party should be considered as the Leader of Opposition so that the Lokpal can be appointed
 lokapal ek aisa kanoon he jo nagarikon ke haq ko majboot karata he isliye lokapal kii niyukti jald se jald honi chahie
 Do not interfere in the work of the government
 On the other hand, the government cited pending amendments in Parliament
 sarkaaraki taraf se atorni general mukul rohtagi ne court se sansad ke kaam main dakhal naa dene aagrah kiya
 Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi told the court that the appointment of Lokpal is not possible during the current session of Parliament as it is a fixed session for the budget
 rohtagi ne kaha ki centre sarkaar agle satr main lokapal kii niyukti kar sakati he
 It is necessary to have a Leader of Opposition for appointment
 20 amendments have been proposed in the Lokpal bill, which are still pending, so it cannot be done right now
 rohtagi ne kaha ki niyukti ke liye netaa pratipaksh kaa hona jaruri he or philhal koineta pratipakshanheen he
 Shanti Bhushan, arguing on behalf of the Common Cause, said that it is very wrong and conceivable that the Lokpal cannot be appointed because it is not formally leader of the opposition
 sabase bade vipakshi dal ke netaa ko karen shamilshantibhushan ne kaha ki lokapal kii niyukti sansad ke baahar kii prakriya he, jisamen netaa pratipaksh aupchaarik rup se naa bhi ho to sabase bade virdohi dal ke netaa ko shaamil karke niyukti kii ja sakati he
 Such a provision is in law, so the appointment of Lokpal should be done soon to investigate corruption cases against leaders
 puri sunwaayee ke baad court ne apana faisla surakshit rakh liya he
 The decision is now on the Advisory Committee which will send its name to the BCCI and it will be approved in the Executive Committee on 24 June

 Modi had said that he had only exercised his right to freedom of speech, criticizing the policies and functioning of the Congress and thus did not violate any code of conduct
 modi ne kaha, ‘meraa spasht maananaa he ki maine kathith praavdhaan kaa ulanghan nahin kiya
 He wrote in his reply that he too has been subject to much criticism and abuses have been used against him, but he has maintained the dignity of political views and has not made personal attacks on his opponents
 modi ke mutabik unhone congress ke khilaaf asabhy tareeke se aarope nahin lagaaya or unhone jo kaha vah asatyaapit nahin he tathaa puri tarah saarvajanik he
 He said that criticism of the adversary is inevitable during the election and that the statements of 'bloody paw' and 'bloodthirsty' are popular locomotives of Hind which have been used only figuratively

 Former President Dr
 Avul Pakir Jainullabdin Abdul Kalam was not only a great scientist, inspirational leader but also a wonderful human being
 unhone jin logon ke saath bhi kaam kiya unke dilon ko chhu liya
 Let's know some inspiring episodes related to his life
 ek baar dephence research and deveopment organijeshan (diardio) main unki team building kii suraksha ko lekar charchaa kar rahi thi
 The team suggested that pieces of glass should be placed on the wall of the building
 lekin docklamne team ke is suzav ko thukraa diya or kaha ki agar ham aisa karenge to is diwaar par pakshi nahin baithenge
 2
 diardio ke purv chif kii maane to 'agni' missile ke test ke samay kalam kaaphi nervas the
 In those days, he used to take his resignation with him
 unka kahana tha ki agar kuch bhi galat hua to wo isaki jimmedaari lenge or apana pad chhod denge
 3
 ek baar kuch naujavaanon ne dow kalam se milane kii ichha jataai
 For this, he wrote a letter in his office
 kalam ne raashtrapati bhawan ke personal chembar main un yuvaaon se na sirf mulaakaat kii balki kaaphi samay unke saath guzaar kar unke idiaj bhi sunen
 Let us tell you that Dr
 Kalam had roamed all over India and met about 17 million youth
 4
 There was a lot of work pressure in DRDO
 ek baar saath main kaam karne vaala ek vaigyanik unke paas aayaa or bolaa ki use samay se pehle ghar janaa he
 Actually the scientist had to show the exhibition to his children
 dow kalam ne use anumati de di
 But during the work, he forgot that he had to go home soon
 baad main use bada bura laga ki wo apane bacchon ko pradarshnee dikhaane nahin le ja sakaa
 When he got home, it was learned that the manager had taken his children to show him the exhibition at Kalam's behest
 5
 On the courage, Dr
 Kalam mentions an incident in one of his books
 unhone likhaa he ki jab wo SU-30 MKI air craft uda rahe the to air craft ke neeche utarane par kai noujvaan or media ke log unase baaten karne lage
 One said that at the age of 74, you did not fear running a supersonic fighter aircraft? Dr
 Kalam's answer to this was, 'during the 40-minute flight, i was busy controlling the instruments and during this time i did not give the time to let the fear in me
 ' The question whether Varun's alleged antipathy against Muslims will give BJP any advantage in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections is churning the party's leaders in the state
 jaahir he party in halaat ko haath se jane dena nahin chaahati or uskaa bharpoor phayda uthaanaa chaahati he
 It is clear that Varun Gandhi, the BJP candidate from Pilibhit, allegedly spewed poison against Muslims on March 8 in Pilibhit for the purpose only to mobilize Hindu voters behind him for his victory
 varun ke haav-bhav, shabd or unka nishaanaa bani birdari unke divangat pita sanjay gandhi kii yaad dilaati he jinhone ''musalamaanon, jinaki jansankhya vruddhi dar hinduon or hindustan ke liye khatra ban rahi he,'' kii ''jabariyaa nasbandi'' kii jabardast vakaalat kii thi
 But when the Lok Sabha elections were held in 1977, the Congress had to lick the dust and pave the way for the first non-congress government in the country
 tab buniyadi antar yah tha ki congress muslim voton par betarah nirbhar thi lekin bhaajapa ko maaloom he ki muslim vot use nahin milane vaale
 In fact, the BJP is desperate to return to its golden days of Hinduism in Uttar Pradesh between 1991-1999 when the party got 29, 57, 52 and 51 seats in the Lok Sabha respectively
 isiilie party is sthiti kaa phayda uthaane kii firaaq main he or yahi kaaran he ki party, sangh parivaar or sadhu-santon ke ek tabake ne varun kaa samarthan kiya he
 The party plans to make his possible arrest in the police-registered case against Varun for not getting relief from the upper court in the presence of top party leaders, a dramatic affair
 tab desh ko yaad dilaayaa jayega ki jab dilli kii jama masjid ke imam moulana bukhari jaise muslim netaa aisi hi bhashaa istemaal karte hai or adaalaton ko lalkaarte hai tab un par haath daalane kii koi himmat nahin karata
 Zafaryab Jilani, who raises the voice of Muslims on socio-economic and religious issues, says the BJP also wants to create a Modi in Uttar Pradesh so that communal sentiments can be exploited but it will not succeed
 bhaajapa ne jabase hindu hiton se jude masalon ko taak par rakhaa, 1999 se rajya main uski lokapriyata ghatati gai
 The party won 27 seats in the state in 1999, which came down to 10 in 2004
 tabase bhaajapa apane kaaryakartaaon kaa manobal ooncha karne ke liye kisi nae hindu pratik kii talash main thi
 The party also succumbed to Yogi Adityanath, an MP from Gorakhpur and a fierce warrior of Hindu interest, to regain his lost base, but due to his limited appeal he could not become the savior of the party

 a resident of Ghaziabad, adjacent to Delhi, has threatened to shoot Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Facebook
 loni ke BJP vidhayak nandakishor gurjar kii shikaayat par aaropee ke khilaaf FIR darj kar lee gai he
 According to the information, the accused made this threat in a comment made on a Facebook post by BJP MLA Nandkishore Gurjar
 jaankaree ke mutabik, nadeem khan naam ke kisi shaks ne bijepi netaa ke fasebuk post par pradhanmantri ko jaan se maarane kii dhamkee di he
 Not only this, accused Nadeem Khan has also written 'pakistan Zindabad' in his next comment
 usne ek or tippanee kii he, jisamen apana mobile number share kiya he or likhaa he ki vah kisi se nahin darataa
 Nandkishore Gurjar posted two pictures and two videos of himself riding a bicycle on his Facebook page at 9:10 am on Thursday
 unhen in tasveeron ke saath sirf 'good morning' bhar likhaa he
 On this post, the accused Nadeem Khan, while making a blistering comment, wrote about shooting the Prime Minister
 nadeem khan likhata he, 'pakistan jindabad
 Whenever i want to meet, i am not afraid of anyone
 kisi se puch bhi lenaa chaahe
 i live in Ashok Vihar
 'bijepi netaa kii shikaayat par loni thane main aaropee ke khilaaf shikaayat darj kar lee gai he

 dakshin bharat kii film 'marsal' main sarkaar ke khilaaf aalochanatmak dialog ko hataane kii maang ko lekar uthe vivaad ne kaaphi tool pakad liya he
 The demand of Tamil Nadu BJP unit to remove this dialogue from the film is being condemned by all opposition parties, including Congress, BJP
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne bhi is mudde par bijepi sarkaar kii jamkar khinchaai kii
 At the same time, Madhur Bhandarkar also questioned the silence of Rahul Gandhi regarding 'indu Sarkar'
 abhinayta vijay kii film 'marsal' ko lekar uthe vivaad or 'indu sarkaar' par madhur bhandarkar dwaara lagaae gaye aaropon ko lekar congress kii netaa or abhinetri nagma ne aaj tak se baatcheet kii
 Producer of 'mursal' on the backfoot, said- if necessary, will remove the gst-linked scene
 He said- The question is, who is asking for a cut in 'mursal'? Some self-employed people are demanding that it seems that something has been said wrong in that film
 haalanki kuch bhi galat nahin kaha gaya
 Its dialogues have been passed by the bjp's censor board itself
 jab sensor board ne paas kar diya to vivaad uthne kii baat hi nahin aati
 According to the law, these people cannot force the producers to cut scenes from the film
 'marsal' film main abhinayta vijay kaa ek dialog he, jisamen vah naam liye bina ek pal kaa zikr karte hai or kehete hai ki kaise ek aspataal main oxigen kii kami se bacchon kii maut ho gai or aspataal ke paas saalon tak oxigen ke liye saplir ko dene ke liye paise nahin the
 Objection is also being raised on this dialogue
 film ko lekar bijepi-congress main takaraav, 3 din main 100 karod ke karibais par nagma ne kaha- jab gorakhpur main bachche mar rahe the, tab yogi amethi jaakar bhaashan de rahe the
 There is a saying in Hindi - If the cat drinks milk with closed eyes, he feels that the world is not watching him
 yogi bhi vahi kar rahe hai
 How many children are dying in their area every day and this is happening till date
 film ek madhyam hota he
 The public who wants to speak is spoken through the film
 jab swasthya sevaayen itnaa mahatvapurn he to use tavajjo kyon nahin diya jaataa?'marsal' film par vivaad uthne ke baad nirmaataa-nirdeshak madhur bhandarkar bhi isamen kud pade or sidhe-sidhe rahul gandhi se sawaal kar diya ki 'indu sarkaar' ke khilaaf se pradarshan ho rahe the tab unhone aawaaj kyon nahin uthaai? nagma ne madhur bhandarkar par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki unki film 'indu sarkaar' flop film thi or jisamen kaant-chhaant bijepi ke sensor board ne kii
 i myself have seen 'indu Sarkar'
 film ke shuru main likhaa tha ki yah sab kaalpanik he
 There was no good thing in that film, neither does it motivate the society to do good work
 unke bolne kii aazaadee par kisne roak lagaai
 In 'indu Sarkar', the censor board of BJP was trimmed
 producers gild ne kii marsal jaise maamalon ke liye alag athurity kii mangangama ne aage kaha, yah vivaad kyon ho rahaa he mujhe nahin samaj main aa rahaa he
 If the Congress had been the government and the censor board was the Congress, it would have understood that an attempt was made to cut it
 film ko bain nahin kiya gaya
 If someone has vandalized and BJP wants to put Congress in it, then tell me that Rahul Gandhi had tweeted at that time that i do not support any kind of sabotage
 baat to 'marsal' or 'indu sarkaar' ko tulana karne kii he hi nahin
 This is a good hero film that is doing very well and is very mal masala
 dakshin main rajnikant ke baad vijay sabase bade hero hai
 The film which was produced by Madhur Bhandarkar had no star cast
 apane hisaab se soch vichaar se jo usamen daalaa, pataa nahin itnaa bada kyon banaaya ja rahaa? aisa tha to bijepi ke kaaryakarta jaakar film dekhte or usko hit karte
 On the question of the way of films, politics and politics on films, Nagma said that there is a decades-old relationship between the two which can never be separated
 Mersal: tamil asmita ke bahaane modi par rahul ne nishaanaa saadhaa, madhur ne kaha- tab kahaan the aap?film or raajnneeti kaa saalon se sambandh rahaa he or ye aaj kaa or kal kaa vishay nahin he
 Take Dev Anand, Dilip Kumar Sahab
 em ji ramchandran or en tii rama raav ko le lijie
 Since that period, all these films have had a very political relationship with politics
 nargis- sunil dutt kaa rishta le lijie
 Hands on the question of the film's controversy, Nagma lashed out at the BJP leaders as well as Union Minister Smriti Irani
 mujhe ek baat bataaie ki jitne saal congress ne jo bhi kiya aaj bijepi uskaa sho cese hi to kar rahi he
 What did you show by doing something new, which is so full of fun? Smriti Irani also speaks a lot but what did the public do? a Chandni fought from the Chowk, she was defeated, and there she did not go back even after a reversal
 amethi amethi kii baat karte hai kyonki rahul gandhi vahaan par hai
 Rajyavardhan Rathore says that Rahul Gandhi doping, running in the field
 kya yah shobhaa detaa he? kya unako kaam kaaj nahin he? apane mantralay main unako kaam diya gaya he usko chhod kar yah sab baaten kar rahe hai

 One reason for the resignation is also being mentioned
 jammu−kashmir ke bandipora ke sambal ilaake main do yuvakon kii maut ke baad log gusse main hai
 People allege that these people died in the firing of army personnel
 sthaneey nivaasiyon kaa kahana he ki yahaan ke markund sambal ilaake main sena ke ek oparation ke dauraan chali goli se ek yuvak kii maut ho gai, jiske baad gaanv vaale iskaa virodh karne sadak par utre
 At that time the soldiers of the army opened fire again, in which another youth was killed

 baharhaal nasik police or mumbai krime branch kii team ke kaam kaa tarika ekadam alag tha
 While the Nashik police were directly threatening Sajjad to his village, the Mumbai Crime Branch team first started collecting information about family and friends at Sajjad's house 
 kyonki vahaan gai nasik police kii team ko patharav kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 The local police had brought them out under their own protection with great difficulty
 ye alag baat he ki duusari baar nasik police sajaad kii maa kaa bayaan lene main kaamyaab rahi thi
 But nothing of Sajjad was known
 pataa chalaa ki sajaad ke teen or bhai hai
 Their names are Taufiq, Amjid and Irrfan
 takreeban 6 maheene baad pehali baar mumbai krime branch kii team jammu gai
 Sources reveal that the police team had clear instructions from their officials from Jammu that they would not go directly to the village or vicinity of Sajjad in Kashmir until any concrete clues were found
 isliye inspector nikam sabase pehle jammu main hi rahakar baraamula main sorce banane main jute gayi
 Simultaneously, started collecting information about the geographical and social status of that area
 vahaan se pataa chalaa ki srinagar ke aage ramban tak to thik he lekin uske aage janaa khatre se khaali nahin he
 The team returned from Jammu itself and came to Mumbai and continued the search through the source made in Jammu
 is bich asipi abhaya shastri apane divijan main waapas laut gaye, police inspector mahesh taavade ko bhi ek hatyakand ke silsile main malad police thane main waapas aana padaa or sipaahi ajay ballaal bhi kisi vajah se team kaa hissaa nahin rahaa
 Only Inspector Sanjay Nikam left the team and the remaining 4 soldiers
 mumbai main rahakar bhi inspector sanjay nikam shant nahin baithe
 Social sites were searched on the Internet in the name of Sajjad's brothers
 kai dinon kii koshish ke baad unhen fasebuk par killer naam se ek pej mila
 On that page created by Sajjad's younger brother, there was also a photo of all 4 brothers together
 lekin photo main bhaaiyon ke peeche jo jagah dikh rahi thi wo sajaad ke gaanv se alag thi
 a careful look revealed that it is a place where some construction work like dam or tunnel is going on
 photo main chaaron bhaaiyon ko saath dekhakar itnaa to saaf ho gaya tha ki sajaad pakistan adhikrut kashmir main nahin bhaaga he, wo isi paar he or apane parivaar ke sampark main he
 a huge clue was found in the hands of the police
 lekin chunauti us jagah ko pahchaanane or vahaan jane kii thi
 With this vital clue, Inspector Nikam left for Srinagar with his team
 iske liye unhone apni dadhi badhaai, or pahanava bhi badal liya
 Staying there, he made some such sources which understood the Baramula area, and kept his life there
 unase baatcheet main pataa chalaa ki us ilaake main har koi nahin ja saktaa
 There are some sensitive areas where the TRP i
e
 Temporary Residence must be near any outside person to go
 uske liye ilaake main us shaks ko jaanane vaala bhi hona chahie
 The area is under the supervision of the army and if there is any doubt, it can shoot
 police team ke saamne dohari chunauti thi
 If they reveal their true identity, Raj was afraid to open up and if he hides his identity, then to eat the pill
 sutron ke mutabik is dauraan sorce banane or jaankaree jutaney ke liye use khub paise bhi kharch karne pade
 It is said that the people there like sweets but they do not get such sweets easily, so they had to work by offering them cans of sweets
 ab tak police team ke paas kaaphi jaankaree jamaa ho chuki thi
 It was also learned that the site seen behind the photo is the site of National Hydro Power on the Jhelum River where construction work is going on
 isse ye andaja lag gaya ki sajaad ho naa ho us jagah par hi mazdooree kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 But it was impossible to go there only on the basis of speculation
 baharhaal pataa chalaa he ki inspector nikam kisi tarah jugad lagaakar ek baar sajaad ke gaanv tak bhi pahunch gayi the
 But when it was received information that 20 to 25 houses belonged to the Mughal family of Sajjad and all gathered on one voice, so it was not appropriate to take any risk at all
 ye bhi pataa chalaa ki sajaad apane ghar me naa rahakar gaanv se 4 kilometre dur jabaad ilaake main apane chachaa sarif ke ghar aata jaataa rahata tha
 Doing something there was risky even from his village
 police team ek baar phir waapas mumbai aakar maukey kaa intjaar karne lagi
 The sweet source continued to work
 oktober ke pehle saptaah main khabar mili ki sonmarg main ek bade project ke nirmaan kaa kaam chal rahaa he, vahaan takreeban dedh hajaar majdoor kaam karte hai
 Many boys from Salamabad also work at that site and live there
 matlab sajaad ke vahaan hone kii prabal sambhaavna thi
 After receiving the information, Inspector Sanjay Nikam left with his three soldiers
 mumbai se srinagar or vahaan se sonmarg
 Srinagar went by airplane, so there is no question of carrying gun and handcuffs
 aise ilaake main jahaan baat baat main patharav, police or sena par bhi hamalaa hone kii ashanka bani rahati hai vahaan 4 log wo bhi nihathe, kuch bhi ho saktaa tha
 But Sajjad had to be apprehended, even without the help of the local police as the matter was feared to be leaked
 sthaneey libaas main team sidhe us site par naa jaakar pehle aasapaas ke gaanv main gai
 Having described himself as an officer of the telephone company, he has come to survey to set up a telephone tower
 aatank or garibi kii dohari maar jhel rahe logon ko aamadani kaa jariya dikhaa or wo uske liye jameen dene ko taiyaar ho gaye
 But the aim of the police was to reach those laborers
 lihaaja tower banane ke liye jaruri mazdooron ko laane kii shart jameen waalon ko hi di gai
 Who would refuse to see money coming? wo log sonmarg main jahaan nirmaan kaam chal rahaa tha vahiin ke kuch thekedaaron ko bula laaye
 They were asked for a quotation and a condition of being taken to the site to see the work of the workers
 thekedaar taiyaar ho gaya or thodi hi der main team un mazdooron ke bich main thi
 Sajid's name was written in the list of laborers of the contractor whom he met by coincidence
 police ko pehle se andeshaa tha ki apni pahchaan chupaane ke liye sajaad duusare naam kaa sahaara le saktaa he or sajid sajaad se miltaa julata he isliye police ne sajid ko dekhnaa chaha
 The police team did not take any time to identify him as soon as the contractor pointed at him
 lekin kisi ne koi hadabadi nahin kii naa hi apane chehre par sajaad ko khoj nikaalane kii khushi ko aane diya
 The team went back
 agle do din use vahaan se uthaane ke maukey kii talash hoti rahi
 But he did not come out of the construction site
 ab police ke saamne mazdooron ke bich me jaakar sajaad ko pakadaney ke alaava koi chaara nahin tha
 Standing the car about 100 meters away, while telling soldiers Daya Kamble and Sandeep Kamble to sit in the same place with the driver, Inspector Nikam went to Sajjad with just one soldier Sandeep Talekar
 sajaad jahaan kaam kar rahaa tha uske thik peeche bada gaddha tha or dar tha ki agar wo bhaagta he to gadde main gir saktaa he or agar aisa hua to baat bigadate der nahin lagegi or uske baad kya hoga kuch kaha nahin ja saktaa tha
 So Impactor Nikam first stood very close to Sajjad towards that pit, then pressed his hand with one hand and said, "sajjad you have to go with me
 " or uskaa haath chhod diya
 But by then the other soldier who went along, according to the plan, stood close to Sajjad from the other side
 inspector nikam ke mutabik unki aawaaj sunate hi sajaad jagah par hi jad gaya
 He did not understand who we are and what he wants
 We gestured to push forward with his body without holding his hand and brought him to the car while talking to him
 sabakuch itani shanti se ho gaya ki aasapaas kaam karne vaale majdoor bhi kuch samaj nahin paye
 Opening the door of the car, as soon as he was seated in the car, he recognized the soldier sitting inside Daya Kamble and came out of his mouth, "hey sir, you?" Daya Kamble is the soldier who was always present in the court to help Special Public Prosecutor Ujwal Nikam during the trial
 sajaad unhen acchhee tarah se pahachaanata tha or dayaa ne dadhi bhi nahin rakhi thi isliye dayaa kamble ko gaadi main hi baithne ko kaha gaya tha
 By the time Sajjad and someone spoke or acted, the other soldier had also sat next to him and the car had also left from there
 driver ke bagal kii seat par baithe inspector sanjay nikam ne peeche mudakar sajaad ko ek seb diya or bole "kha"
 It did not take long to recognize Sajjad and he spoke up, Mr
 Nikam, are you? sawaal he ki sajaad mughal ko pataa tha ki police uski talash main he
 If not today then he will be caught tomorrow
 phir wo seemaa paar kyon nahin bhaag gaya? inspector sanjay nikam ke mutabik ye sawaal unhone bhi usase poocha tha
 Then Sajjad's answer was, Sir, there is no life beyond that
 garibi, bekaari or jillat ke sivaa vahaan kuch nahin he isaliye main yaheen rahakar jeena chaah rahaa tha
 The story after this is obvious
 sajaad kii giraftaar kitni ahm thi iskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki khud mumbai police ayukta dattatreya padsalgikar ne patrkaar parishad laker uski giraftaar kii ghoshnaa kii
 He told that as soon as i got the information about the arrest of Sajjad, i first called Pallavi's father Purkayastha and told him that my eyes were filled with tears
 wo bole mujhe isi pal kaa intjaar tha
 The Commissioner of Police introduced the entire team to journalists
 tippaniyan Sanjay Nikam, who is a wrestler from Kadakathi, has also been among the frontrunners in the 26 / 11 terror attack
 us samay wo property cell main the
 In 2008, the property cell broke the back of terrorist organization Indian Mujahideen by holding the Pune module of Indian Mujahideen
 tab arun chavaan property cell ke incharge the or shripad kaale, nandkumar gopaale, sanjay nikam or ajay saavant us team ke ahm hissaa the
 It was a big setback for the Indian Mujahideen who had been puzzle till that time
 uske baad ahmedabad or karnataka main bhi badi sankhya main uske aatanki pakade gaye
 At that time, the late RR Patil was the Home Minister of the state and promised a reward of Rs 5 lakh
 lekin baad main 26 / 11 aatanki hamale ke baad unhone istipha diya or wo vaada sirf ghoshnaa banakar rah gaya
 Surprisingly, the team that exposed the organization that carried out the terrorist incidents in the country from 2000 to 2008 did not even get a single award
 mila he to sirf krime branch main tab ke atirikt police ayukta deven bharti kaa ek abhinandan patr
 Now the team sending the absconding killer from the difficult circumstances of Kashmir and holding him back without any disturbance is praised
 khud mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne twit kar shaabaashi di he
 But the question is, will they get reward and reward on their bravery, dedication and success or will it remain a mere verbal exercise like the year 2008? pataa chalaa ki sajaad ke teen or bhai hai
 Their names are Taufiq, Amjid and Irrfan

 Meanwhile ACP Abhay Shastri returned to his division, police inspector Mahesh Tawde also had to return to the Malad police station in connection with a murder and constable Ajay Ballal was also not part of the team for any reason
 team main rah gayi sirf inspector sanjay nikam or baaki ke 4 sipaahi
 Inspector Sanjay Nikam did not remain calm even while living in Mumbai
 sajaad ke bhaiyon ke naam se internet par soshal site khangalate rahe
 After several days of trying, he found a page on Facebook called Killer
 sajaad ke chote bhai dwaara banaaye gaye us pej par sabhi 4 bhaiyon kaa ek saath ek photo bhi tha
 But the place seen in the photo behind the brothers was different from the village of Sajjad
 dhyaan se dekhne par pataa chalaa ki wo koi aisi jagah he jahaan baandh yaa tunnel jaisaa koi nirmaan kaary chal rahaa he
 Seeing the four brothers together in the photo, it was clear that Sajjad has not escaped into Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, he is on the same side and is in touch with his family
 police ke haath bahut bada suraag lag gaya tha
 But the challenge was to identify the place and go there
 is ahm suraag ke saath inspector nikam apni team ke saath ab srinagar ke liye nikal gayi
 For this, he grew his beard, and also changed his dress
 vahaan rahakar unhone kuch aise sorce banaaye jo baraamula ilaake ko samajhate the, vahaan jaan pahchaan rakhte the
 In conversation with him, it was found that not everyone can go to that area
 vahaan kuch aise samvedansheel ilaake hai jahaan jane ke liye kisi bhi bahari shaks ke paas tiarapy yani temporary racidence paas hona chahie
 He should also know that person in the area
 wo ilaaka sena kii nigaraanee main he or jaraa bhi shaq hone par wo goli maar sakati he
 The police team had a double challenge
 agar wo apni asli pahchaan jaahir karte hai to raaj khulne kaa dar tha or pahchaan chhupate hai to goli khaane kaa
 According to sources, during this time, he had to spend a lot of money to build sources and gather information
 bataate hai ki vahaan ke logon ko mithai pasand he lekin vahaan is tarah kii mithai aasaani se nahin milti isliye unhen mithai ke dibbe bhent kar kaam nikaalnaa padaa
 By now, a lot of information had been gathered with the police team
 ye bhi pataa chal chukaa tha ki photo main peeche dikh rahi jagah jhelum nadi par neshnal hydro power kii site hai jahaan nirmaan kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 From this, it was guessed that Sajjad should not be working at that place
 lekin sirf andaaje par hi vahaan jane kaa jokhim nahin liya ja saktaa tha
 However, it has been learned that Inspector Nikam somehow reached the village of Sajjad once after putting a jugaad
 lekin jab ye jaankaree mili ki vahaan 20 se 25 ghar sajaad ke mughal parivaar ke hi hai or ek aawaaj par sabhi jamaa ho jate hai isaliye vahaan jaraa bhi jokhim mol lenaa munasib nahin tha
 It was also learned that Sajjad, instead of staying in his house, used to keep coming to his uncle Sarif's house in Jabar area, 4 km from the village
 vahaan kuch karnaa uske gaanv se bhi jokhim bharaa tha
 The police team once again came back to Mumbai and waited for the opportunity
 mithai vaale sorce kaam me lage rahe
 In the first week of October, it was reported that the work of construction of a large project is going on in Sonamarg, about one and a half thousand workers work there
 salamabad se bhi kai ladke us site par mazdooree karte hai or vahiin rahete hai
 Meaning Sajjad had a strong possibility of being there
 soochna milane ke baad inspector sanjay nikam apane teen sipaahiyon ke saath nikal gaye
 Srinagar to Mumbai and from there to Sonmarg
 srinagar hawaii jahaaj se gayi the isaliye bandook or hathkadi le jane kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota
 In such an area where there is possibility of attack on stone pelting, police and army also, there could be 4 people unarmed, anything could happen
 lekin sajaad ko pakadana tha wo bhi bina sthaneey police kii sahaayta liye kyonki baat li hone kaa dar tha
 In the local veneer, the team did not go directly to that site and went to the surrounding village first
 khud ko telephone company kaa afasar bataakar telephone tower lagane ke liye survey karne aayaa he bataaya
 People who were facing the double whammy of terror and poverty showed a source of income and they agreed to give land for it
 lekin police kaa lakshya to un mazdooron tak pahunchnaa tha
 Therefore, the condition of bringing the necessary laborers to build the tower was given to the land owners
 paisa aata dekh bhala koun manaa karegaa
 Those people called some contractors from where the construction work was going on in Sonmarg
 unase kotesan maanga gaya or mazdooron ke kaam dekhne ke liye us site par le jane kii shart rakhi gai
 The contractor was ready and within a short time the team was among those workers
 ittefaq se jis thekedaar se mulaakaat hui thi uske mazdooron kii list main sajid naam likhaa tha
 The police had foreseen that Sajjad might resort to another name to hide his identity and that Sajid was similar to Sajjad, so the police wanted to see Sajid
 thekedaar kaa uski taraf ishaara karte hi police team ko use pahchaanane main der nahin lagi
 But no one hurried nor let the joy of finding Sajjad come on his face
 team waapas chali gai
 The next two days kept looking for a chance to pick him up
 lekin wo construction site se baahar nahin aayaa
 Now the police had no choice but to go and capture Sajjad among the workers
 takreeban 100 meter dur gaadi khadi kar sipaahi dayaa kamble or sandip kamble ko driver ke saath usee main baithe rahane ko kahkar impector nikam sirf ek sipaahi sandip talekar ke saath sajaad ke paas gaye
 There was a big pit just behind Sajjad where he was working and was afraid that if he runs away he might fall into the pit and if this happens then the matter will not be delayed and nothing will be said after that
 isliye impsector nikam pehle us gadde kii taraf sajaad ke bilkul kareeb khadey hue phir ek haath se uske haath ko dabaaya or bole, "sajaad tuje mere saath chalanaa he
 "and released his hand
 lekin tab tak saath main gaya doosraa sipaahi tay yojana ke mutabik duusari taraf se sajaad se satakar khadaa ho gaya
 According to Inspector Nikam, Sajjad took root at the place as soon as he heard his voice
 use kuch samaj hi nahin aayaa ki ham koun hai or kya chaahate hai? hamane uskaa haath bina pakade hi sharir se dhakka dekar aage chalane kaa ishaara kiya or usase saamaanya baat karte karte gaadi ke paas laaye
 Everything happened so peacefully that even the laborers working nearby could not understand anything
 gaadi kaa darwaja kholkar jaise hi use gaadi main bithaaya gaya andar baithe sipaahi dayaa kamble ko dekh kar wo pahchaan gaya or uske munh se aawaaj nikali "are sahab aap?" dayaa kamble wo sipaahi hai jo mukademe ke dauraan vishesh sarkari vakil ujwal nikam kii madad ke liye hameshaa adaalat main maujuud rahete the
 Sajjad knew him well and Daya did not even have a beard so Daya Kamble was asked to sit in the car
 sajaad or kuch bolta yaa harakat karata tab tak doosraa sipaahi bhi uske bagal main baith chukaa tha or gaadi bhi vahaan se nikal chuki thi
 The inspector Sanjay Nikam, sitting on the seat next to the driver, turned back and gave Sajjad an apple and said "eat"
 sajaad ko pahachaanate der nahin lagi or bol uthaa nikam sahab aap hai? The question is whether Sajjad Mughal knew that the police were looking for him
 aaj nahin to kal wo pakadaa hi jaayegaa
 Then why did he not run across the border? According to Inspector Sanjay Nikam, he also asked this question to him
 tab sajaad kaa jawaab tha, sahab us paar jindagi nahin he
 There is nothing but poverty, unemployment and livelihood, so i wanted to live here
 iske baad kii kahani to jag jaahir he
 How important Sajjad's arrest was can be gauged from the fact that Mumbai Police Commissioner Dattatreya Padsalgikar himself announced his arrest
 unhone bataaya ki jaise hi mujhe sajaad kii giraftaar kii soochna mili maine sabase pehle pallavi ke pita purkysth ko phone kar bataaya to unki aankh main aasuun aa gaye
 He said that i was waiting for this moment
 police ayukta ne puri team kaa parichay patrakaron se karaayaa
 The comments kadalathi se pahalwaan lagane vaale inspector sanjay nikam 26 / 11 aatanki hamale main bhi morcha sanbhaalane waalon main rahe hai
 He was in the property cell at that time
 property cell ne hi saal 2008 main indian mujahidin ke pune modul ko pakad kar aatanki sanghathan indian mujahidin kii qamar todi thi
 Then Arun Chavan was in charge of the property cell and Shripad Kale, Nandkumar Gopale, Sanjay Nikam and Ajay Sawant were important part of that team
 uske pehle tak paheli rahe indian mujahidin ke liye wo bada jhatka tha
 a large number of his terrorists were also caught in Ahmedabad and Karnataka after that
 us samay divangat aar aar patil rajya ke grahamantri the unhone 5 lakh rupee inaam dene kaa vaada kiya tha
 But later he resigned after the 26 / 11 terror attack and that promise was just a declaration
 hairaani kii baat he ki saal 2000 se 2008 tak desh main aatanki vaardaaton ko anjaam dene vaale sanghathan ko benakaab karne vaali team ko inaam to dur ek adad puraskaar bhi nahin mila
 Found only a greeting letter from then Additional Commissioner of Police Deven Bharti in Crime Branch
 ab kashmir kii duruh paristhitiyon main se faraar qaatil ko khoj nikaalane or bina kisi gadabadi ke use pakadakar waapas salaakhon ke peeche bhejne vaali team kii tarif to khub ho rahi he
 Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis himself has tweeted and tweeted
 lekin sawaal he kya inhen inaki bahaduree, samarpan or safalataa par inaam or puraskaar milegaa yaa phir saal 2008 kii tarah sirf jubaani kavayad ban kar rah jaayegi? With this vital clue, Inspector Nikam left for Srinagar with his team
 iske liye unhone apni dadhi badhaai, or pahanava bhi badal liya
 Staying there, he made some such sources which understood the Baramula area, and kept his life there
 unase baatcheet main pataa chalaa ki us ilaake main har koi nahin ja saktaa
 There are some sensitive areas where the TRP i
e
 Temporary Residence must be near any outside person to go
 uske liye ilaake main us shaks ko jaanane vaala bhi hona chahie
 The area is under the supervision of the army and if there is any doubt, it can shoot
 police team ke saamne dohari chunauti thi
 If they reveal their true identity, Raj was afraid to open up and if he hides his identity, then to eat the pill
 sutron ke mutabik is dauraan sorce banane or jaankaree jutaney ke liye use khub paise bhi kharch karne pade
 It is said that the people there like sweets but they do not get such sweets easily, so they had to work by offering them cans of sweets
 ab tak police team ke paas kaaphi jaankaree jamaa ho chuki thi
 It was also learned that the site seen behind the photo is the site of National Hydro Power on the Jhelum River where construction work is going on
 isse ye andaja lag gaya ki sajaad ho naa ho us jagah par hi mazdooree kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 But it was impossible to go there only on the basis of speculation
 baharhaal pataa chalaa he ki inspector nikam kisi tarah jugad lagaakar ek baar sajaad ke gaanv tak bhi pahunch gayi the
 But when it was received information that 20 to 25 houses belonged to the Mughal family of Sajjad and all gathered on one voice, so it was not appropriate to take any risk at all
 ye bhi pataa chalaa ki sajaad apane ghar me naa rahakar gaanv se 4 kilometre dur jabaad ilaake main apane chachaa sarif ke ghar aata jaataa rahata tha
 Doing something there was risky even from his village
 police team ek baar phir waapas mumbai aakar maukey kaa intjaar karne lagi
 The sweet source continued to work
 oktober ke pehle saptaah main khabar mili ki sonmarg main ek bade project ke nirmaan kaa kaam chal rahaa he, vahaan takreeban dedh hajaar majdoor kaam karte hai
 Many boys from Salamabad also work at that site and live there
 matlab sajaad ke vahaan hone kii prabal sambhaavna thi
 After receiving the information, Inspector Sanjay Nikam left with his three soldiers
 mumbai se srinagar or vahaan se sonmarg
 Srinagar went by airplane, so there is no question of carrying gun and handcuffs
 aise ilaake main jahaan baat baat main patharav, police or sena par bhi hamalaa hone kii ashanka bani rahati hai vahaan 4 log wo bhi nihathe, kuch bhi ho saktaa tha
 But Sajjad had to be apprehended, even without the help of the local police as the matter was feared to be leaked
 sthaneey libaas main team sidhe us site par naa jaakar pehle aasapaas ke gaanv main gai
 Having described himself as an officer of the telephone company, he has come to survey to set up a telephone tower
 aatank or garibi kii dohari maar jhel rahe logon ko aamadani kaa jariya dikhaa or wo uske liye jameen dene ko taiyaar ho gaye
 But the aim of the police was to reach those laborers
 lihaaja tower banane ke liye jaruri mazdooron ko laane kii shart jameen waalon ko hi di gai
 Who would refuse to see money coming? wo log sonmarg main jahaan nirmaan kaam chal rahaa tha vahiin ke kuch thekedaaron ko bula laaye
 They were asked for a quotation and a condition of being taken to the site to see the work of the workers
 thekedaar taiyaar ho gaya or thodi hi der main team un mazdooron ke bich main thi
 Sajid's name was written in the list of laborers of the contractor whom he met by coincidence
 police ko pehle se andeshaa tha ki apni pahchaan chupaane ke liye sajaad duusare naam kaa sahaara le saktaa he or sajid sajaad se miltaa julata he isliye police ne sajid ko dekhnaa chaha
 The police team did not take any time to identify him as soon as the contractor pointed at him
 lekin kisi ne koi hadabadi nahin kii naa hi apane chehre par sajaad ko khoj nikaalane kii khushi ko aane diya
 The team went back
 agle do din use vahaan se uthaane ke maukey kii talash hoti rahi
 But he did not come out of the construction site
 ab police ke saamne mazdooron ke bich me jaakar sajaad ko pakadaney ke alaava koi chaara nahin tha
 Standing the car about 100 meters away, while telling soldiers Daya Kamble and Sandeep Kamble to sit in the same place with the driver, Inspector Nikam went to Sajjad with just one soldier Sandeep Talekar
 sajaad jahaan kaam kar rahaa tha uske thik peeche bada gaddha tha or dar tha ki agar wo bhaagta he to gadde main gir saktaa he or agar aisa hua to baat bigadate der nahin lagegi or uske baad kya hoga kuch kaha nahin ja saktaa tha
 So Impactor Nikam first stood very close to Sajjad towards that pit, then pressed his hand with one hand and said, "sajjad you have to go with me
 " or uskaa haath chhod diya
 But by then the other soldier who went along, according to the plan, stood close to Sajjad from the other side
 inspector nikam ke mutabik unki aawaaj sunate hi sajaad jagah par hi jad gaya
 He did not understand who we are and what he wants
 We gestured to push forward with his body without holding his hand and brought him to the car while talking to him
 sabakuch itani shanti se ho gaya ki aasapaas kaam karne vaale majdoor bhi kuch samaj nahin paye
 Opening the door of the car, as soon as he was seated in the car, he recognized the soldier sitting inside Daya Kamble and came out of his mouth, "hey sir, you?" Daya Kamble is the soldier who was always present in the court to help Special Public Prosecutor Ujwal Nikam during the trial
 sajaad unhen acchhee tarah se pahachaanata tha or dayaa ne dadhi bhi nahin rakhi thi isliye dayaa kamble ko gaadi main hi baithne ko kaha gaya tha
 By the time Sajjad and someone spoke or acted, the other soldier had also sat next to him and the car had also left from there
 driver ke bagal kii seat par baithe inspector sanjay nikam ne peeche mudakar sajaad ko ek seb diya or bole "kha"
 It did not take long to recognize Sajjad and he spoke up, Mr
 Nikam, are you? sawaal he ki sajaad mughal ko pataa tha ki police uski talash main he
 If not today then he will be caught tomorrow
 phir wo seemaa paar kyon nahin bhaag gaya? inspector sanjay nikam ke mutabik ye sawaal unhone bhi usase poocha tha
 Then Sajjad's answer was, Sir, there is no life beyond that
 garibi, bekaari or jillat ke sivaa vahaan kuch nahin he isaliye main yaheen rahakar jeena chaah rahaa tha
 The story after this is obvious
 sajaad kii giraftaar kitni ahm thi iskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki khud mumbai police ayukta dattatreya padsalgikar ne patrkaar parishad laker uski giraftaar kii ghoshnaa kii
 He told that as soon as i got the information about the arrest of Sajjad, i first called Pallavi's father Purkayastha and told him that my eyes were filled with tears
 wo bole mujhe isi pal kaa intjaar tha
 The Commissioner of Police introduced the entire team to journalists
 tippaniyan Sanjay Nikam, who is a wrestler from Kadakathi, has also been among the frontrunners in the 26 / 11 terror attack
 us samay wo property cell main the
 In 2008, the property cell broke the back of terrorist organization Indian Mujahideen by holding the Pune module of Indian Mujahideen
 tab arun chavaan property cell ke incharge the or shripad kaale, nandkumar gopaale, sanjay nikam or ajay saavant us team ke ahm hissaa the
 It was a big setback for the Indian Mujahideen who had been puzzle till that time
 uske baad ahmedabad or karnataka main bhi badi sankhya main uske aatanki pakade gaye
 At that time, the late RR Patil was the Home Minister of the state and promised a reward of Rs 5 lakh
 lekin baad main 26 / 11 aatanki hamale ke baad unhone istipha diya or wo vaada sirf ghoshnaa banakar rah gaya
 Surprisingly, the team that exposed the organization that carried out the terrorist incidents in the country from 2000 to 2008 did not even get a single award
 mila he to sirf krime branch main tab ke atirikt police ayukta deven bharti kaa ek abhinandan patr
 Now the team sending the absconding killer from the difficult circumstances of Kashmir and holding him back without any disturbance is praised
 khud mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne twit kar shaabaashi di he
 But the question is, will they get reward and reward on their bravery, dedication and success or will it remain a mere verbal exercise like the year 2008? wo ilaaka sena kii nigaraanee main he or jaraa bhi shaq hone par wo goli maar sakati he
 The police team had a double challenge
 agar wo apni asli pahchaan jaahir karte hai to raaj khulne kaa dar tha or pahchaan chhupate hai to goli khaane kaa
 According to sources, during this time, he had to spend a lot of money to build sources and gather information
 bataate hai ki vahaan ke logon ko mithai pasand he lekin vahaan is tarah kii mithai aasaani se nahin milti isliye unhen mithai ke dibbe bhent kar kaam nikaalnaa padaa
 By now, a lot of information had been gathered with the police team
 ye bhi pataa chal chukaa tha ki photo main peeche dikh rahi jagah jhelum nadi par neshnal hydro power kii site hai jahaan nirmaan kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 From this, it was guessed that Sajjad should not be working at that place
 lekin sirf andaaje par hi vahaan jane kaa jokhim nahin liya ja saktaa tha
 However, it has been learned that Inspector Nikam somehow reached the village of Sajjad once after putting a jugaad
 lekin jab ye jaankaree mili ki vahaan 20 se 25 ghar sajaad ke mughal parivaar ke hi hai or ek aawaaj par sabhi jamaa ho jate hai isaliye vahaan jaraa bhi jokhim mol lenaa munasib nahin tha
 It was also learned that Sajjad, instead of staying in his house, used to keep coming to his uncle Sarif's house in Jabar area, 4 km from the village
 vahaan kuch karnaa uske gaanv se bhi jokhim bharaa tha
 The police team once again came back to Mumbai and waited for the opportunity

 Then Arun Chavan was in charge of the property cell and Shripad Kale, Nandkumar Gopale, Sanjay Nikam and Ajay Sawant were important part of that team

 ab kashmir kii duruh paristhitiyon main se faraar qaatil ko khoj nikaalane or bina kisi gadabadi ke use pakadakar waapas salaakhon ke peeche bhejne vaali team kii tarif to khub ho rahi he
 Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis himself has tweeted and tweeted
 lekin sawaal he kya inhen inaki bahaduree, samarpan or safalataa par inaam or puraskaar milegaa yaa phir saal 2008 kii tarah sirf jubaani kavayad ban kar rah jaayegi? In the first week of October, it was reported that the work of construction of a large project is going on in Sonamarg, about one and a half thousand workers work there
 salamabad se bhi kai ladke us site par mazdooree karte hai or vahiin rahete hai
 Meaning Sajjad had a strong possibility of being there
 soochna milane ke baad inspector sanjay nikam apane teen sipaahiyon ke saath nikal gaye
 Srinagar to Mumbai and from there to Sonmarg
 srinagar hawaii jahaaj se gayi the isaliye bandook or hathkadi le jane kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota
 In such an area where there is possibility of attack on stone pelting, police and army also, there could be 4 people unarmed, anything could happen
 lekin sajaad ko pakadana tha wo bhi bina sthaneey police kii sahaayta liye kyonki baat li hone kaa dar tha
 In the local veneer, the team did not go directly to that site and went to the surrounding village first
 khud ko telephone company kaa afasar bataakar telephone tower lagane ke liye survey karne aayaa he bataaya
 People who were facing the double whammy of terror and poverty showed a source of income and they agreed to give land for it
 lekin police kaa lakshya to un mazdooron tak pahunchnaa tha
 Therefore, the condition of bringing the necessary laborers to build the tower was given to the land owners
 paisa aata dekh bhala koun manaa karegaa
 Those people called some contractors from where the construction work was going on in Sonmarg
 unase kotesan maanga gaya or mazdooron ke kaam dekhne ke liye us site par le jane kii shart rakhi gai
 The contractor was ready and within a short time the team was among those workers
 ittefaq se jis thekedaar se mulaakaat hui thi uske mazdooron kii list main sajid naam likhaa tha
 The police had foreseen that Sajjad might resort to another name to hide his identity and that Sajid was similar to Sajjad, so the police wanted to see Sajid
 thekedaar kaa uski taraf ishaara karte hi police team ko use pahchaanane main der nahin lagi
 But no one hurried nor let the joy of finding Sajjad come on his face
 team waapas chali gai
 The next two days kept looking for a chance to pick him up
 lekin wo construction site se baahar nahin aayaa
 Now the police had no choice but to go and capture Sajjad among the workers
 takreeban 100 meter dur gaadi khadi kar sipaahi dayaa kamble or sandip kamble ko driver ke saath usee main baithe rahane ko kahkar impector nikam sirf ek sipaahi sandip talekar ke saath sajaad ke paas gaye
 There was a big pit just behind Sajjad where he was working and was afraid that if he runs away he might fall into the pit and if this happens then the matter will not be delayed and nothing will be said after that
 isliye impsector nikam pehle us gadde kii taraf sajaad ke bilkul kareeb khadey hue phir ek haath se uske haath ko dabaaya or bole, "sajaad tuje mere saath chalanaa he
 "and released his hand
 lekin tab tak saath main gaya doosraa sipaahi tay yojana ke mutabik duusari taraf se sajaad se satakar khadaa ho gaya
 According to Inspector Nikam, Sajjad took root at the place as soon as he heard his voice
 use kuch samaj hi nahin aayaa ki ham koun hai or kya chaahate hai? hamane uskaa haath bina pakade hi sharir se dhakka dekar aage chalane kaa ishaara kiya or usase saamaanya baat karte karte gaadi ke paas laaye
 Everything happened so peacefully that even the laborers working nearby could not understand anything
opening the door gaadi kaa darwaja kholkar jaise hi use gaadi main bithaaya gaya andar baithe sipaahi dayaa kamble ko dekh kar wo pahchaan gaya or uske munh se aawaaj nikali "are sahab aap?" dayaa kamble wo sipaahi hai jo mukademe ke dauraan vishesh sarkari vakil ujwal nikam kii madad ke liye hameshaa adaalat main maujuud rahete the
 Sajjad knew him well and Daya did not even have a beard so Daya Kamble was asked to sit in the car
 sajaad or kuch bolta yaa harakat karata tab tak doosraa sipaahi bhi uske bagal main baith chukaa tha or gaadi bhi vahaan se nikal chuki thi
 The inspector Sanjay Nikam, sitting on the seat next to the driver, turned back and gave Sajjad an apple and said "eat"
 sajaad ko pahachaanate der nahin lagi or bol uthaa nikam sahab aap hai? The question is whether Sajjad Mughal knew that the police were looking for him
 aaj nahin to kal wo pakadaa hi jaayegaa
 Then why did he not run across the border? According to Inspector Sanjay Nikam, he also asked this question to him
 tab sajaad kaa jawaab tha, sahab us paar jindagi nahin he
 There is nothing but poverty, unemployment and livelihood, so i wanted to live here

 driver ke bagal kii seat par baithe inspector sanjay nikam ne peeche mudakar sajaad ko ek seb diya or bole "kha"
 It did not take long to recognize Sajjad and he spoke up, Mr
 Nikam, are you? sawaal he ki sajaad mughal ko pataa tha ki police uski talash main he
 If not today then he will be caught tomorrow
 phir wo seemaa paar kyon nahin bhaag gaya? inspector sanjay nikam ke mutabik ye sawaal unhone bhi usase poocha tha
 Then Sajjad's answer was, Sir, there is no life beyond that
 garibi, bekaari or jillat ke sivaa vahaan kuch nahin he isaliye main yaheen rahakar jeena chaah rahaa tha
 The story after this is obvious

 tab arun chavaan property cell ke incharge the or shripad kaale, nandkumar gopaale, sanjay nikam or ajay saavant us team ke ahm hissaa the
 It was a big setback for the Indian Mujahideen who had been puzzle till that time
 uske baad ahmedabad or karnataka main bhi badi sankhya main uske aatanki pakade gaye
 At that time, the late RR Patil was the Home Minister of the state and promised a reward of Rs 5 lakh
 lekin baad main 26 / 11 aatanki hamale ke baad unhone istipha diya or wo vaada sirf ghoshnaa banakar rah gaya
 Surprisingly, the team that exposed the organization that carried out the terrorist incidents in the country from 2000 to 2008 did not even get a single award

 Now the team sending the absconding killer from the difficult circumstances of Kashmir and holding him back without any disturbance is praised
 khud mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne twit kar shaabaashi di he
 But the question is, will they get reward and reward on their bravery, dedication and success or will it remain a mere verbal exercise like the year 2008? sawaal he ki sajaad mughal ko pataa tha ki police uski talash main he

 However, CMIE reduced production growth estimates of finished steel to 9% from 12% in FY 2011-12

 sanskaar hai isiilie aate hi namaste kiya, acchhee-khaasi oonchaai he, mohalle kii sari aantiyaan balb badalane or pankhe saaf karne ke liye baar-baar bula sakati hai
 On the last day of the three-day tour, Barack was also remembering Obamamerikom and was seen speaking the dialogue of 'dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge', meaning the boy seems to like to play and the film made it clear that there is also laughter, caste- If there was no age bond and Michelle next to her, then the aunts of the locality would leave only a few dozen girls
 khayr obama gaye lekin shahrukh khan ko khush chhod gaye, dilavaale
 
 ke ek dialog se maratha mandir main agle paanch sau hafton kaa intjaam or ho gaya he
 He did not say the dialogue of 'happy New Year' instead of Shah Rukh's 'dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge', otherwise Modi would not even give a hundred fifty-one envelope in farewell
 dilavaale dulhaniya ke ek dialog ke baad hamane kaaphi talasha or khoj ke laae hai hindi filmon ke wo sadabahaar dialog jo obama bol sakate hai
 Don't think too much about me - yes, these dialogues of brother's 'kick' can be seen speaking to Obama Nawaz Sharif
 bharat aagaman ke liye haa kehete vakt unhone pakistan kaa nimantran thukraa diya tha so navaj sharif mere bare main zyada mat sochna main hindustan aata hum pakistan nahin
 In the relationship, we feel your father - Barack Obama's precept can be useful to the dragon in the international market, here we mean not America or Obama, but two superpowers, India and America who sit together and drink tea even if it hurts
 It appears in Chinese newspapers
 maay nem ij baraak -baraak obama ke naam main bhi ‘hossain’ ghusaane waalon kii kami nahi he, or bharat main aakiri din bolte vaqt unhone ishaara bhi kiya ki jo log unhen nahin jaanate wo is kaaran se unki aasthaa par sawaal khadey karte hai,wo kisi dharm se sambandh rakhte hai or ye galat nahi he isliye obama shahrukh kaa ye samvaad dohraane main bhi gurej na karen
 After today, my daughter will not be disturbed if i see her around - Barack Obama will be seen speaking in the US media's favorite dialogue of fathers, who have been raising rumors about Obama's elder daughter getting pregnant for some time
 
 aaj itani bhi mayssar nahi maikhane main, jitani ham chhod diya karte the paimaane main-sher kiskaa he koun nahi jaanata par sharaabi film main bolaa gaya ye samvaad pichley dinon baraak obama par feet baith rahaa tha,obama ko jaanane vaale bhalee-bhaanti jaanate hai ki wo ek samay main drug edict rah chuke hai,cocaine,marijuana or sharaab unke liye aam baat thi,kaash ham jaan pate dry de par bharat aae obama ne akele main ye samvaad kitni baar doharaaya tha
 Brother, i will not let you have anything - this dialogue from Obama for all those who have taken the Obama Healthcare Policy ׀ Those whose glass houses do not throw stones at the homes of others - American company created 'the Interview' , North Korea attacked Sony's website through hackers, in return, the US stopped their internet system, a better situation for this dialogue of Rajkumar Sahab Or may be? desh ke share bazaaron main buudhvaar ko giravat darj kii gai
