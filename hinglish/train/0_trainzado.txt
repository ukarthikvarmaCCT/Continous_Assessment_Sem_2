 Murder mystery of a family in Delhi opened two years later
 upi police ne honor kiling bataa kar cese kar diya tha band
 But only one clue exposed the vicious killers
 jinhen upi police ne bataaya qaatil asal main wo shikaar nikle
 May God save anyone from the investigation of UP police
 do saal pehle jab dilli ke wazirabad kaa ye parivaar achaanak ek rose rahasyamayi tareeqe se kahin gaayab ho gaya, to har koi hairaan tha
 Surprisingly, where did four people from the same family go together suddenly without telling anyone? But when the girl's body was recovered from this canal of Hapur, including her car, after a day, many people felt that the family may have disappeared after killing their daughter
 yani maamla honor kiling kaa he
 But even if this mistake was made by the common people, it could still be understood
 magar upi police kii maasoomiyat dekhie ki aam logon kii isi theory par usne bhi aankh moond kar yakeen kar liya
 And filed a charge sheet in the court, saying that the family itself, after killing their daughter, jumped into the same canal and died
 ye or baat he ki tab se lekar aaj tak ek beti ke sivaay is parivaar ke or kisi bhi member kii laash police ke haath nahin lagi
 01 November 2018 But now suddenly, after so many days, the crime branch of Delhi Police comes to the fore
 or ye kehete hue chaar logon kii maut kii honor kiling kii theory puri tarah palat detii he ki maamla to honor kiling kaa he hi nahin, balki dilli ke hi teen ladakon ne parivaar ke mukhiya yani veda prakaash se liye gaye rupee naa chukaane ke liye uske saath-saath uske parivaar kaa qatl kar diya tha
 That is, the case was not about honor killing and then suicide, but the murder of four straight people
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki aakhir upi police se ek sangeen maamle ko sulajhane main ye mahagalati hui kaise? kahin aisa to nahin ki upi police ne jaanboojh karqaatilonko bachaane ke liye maamle ko honor kiling or baaki logon ke faraar hone kaa rukh de diya? akhir is maamle ke teen qaatil sabaki nigahon ke saamne hote hue bhi itane dinon tak pakade kyon nahin gaye? kisi ko in qaatilon ke haav-bhav par ab tak shaq kyon nahin hua?to jab dilli police kii krime branch ne tafteesh aage badhaai, to inamen se zyaadaatar sawaalon kaa jawaab bhi saamne aa gaya

 The political atmosphere in the country has become hot after Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's alleged call on Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as a rural woman
 magar pakistani patrakaron kii maane to navaj sharif ne bharat ke piem ko dehati aurat nahin kaha tha
 Sharif had told an anecdote that India Pakistan should not go to the US on its quarrels or mutual issues
 bakaul pakistani patrkaar, navaj sharif kaa kissa kuch yun tha
 Many men were sleeping in a room in a village
 tabhi unamem se ek uth baitha or allaah ko yaad karte hue ibaadat karne laga
 After some time he started saying that everyone else is sleeping, while i have woken up and am engaged in prayer
 tab kamare main so rahaa ek or aadmi uthaa or pehle vaale aadmi se bolaa ki tum apni ibaadat apane tak simit rakho or dusron ke bare main shikaayat mat karo
 According to Pakistani channel Aaj TV anchor Absar Alam, Nawaz had narrated the anecdote about how appropriate it is to discuss Obama on some issue in Pakistan's Punjab which is of India's interest
 alam yahaan aatankwaadi sanghathan jamaat ud daawa kii baat kar rahe the, jise navaj sharif ke chote bhai shahbaaj sharif kii punjab sarkaar aarthik madad de rahi he
 Hamid Mir had said that the country woman had started the whole diplomatic crisis when Hamid Mir of Pakistan TV channel Geo quoted Nawaz Sharif as saying that the Indian Prime Minister is behaving like a rustic woman who is doing everything Seeks help from God
 jab mir ke is khulaase ke baad bhartiya paksh kii naaraazgi saamne aane lagi, to unhone twitor par likhaa ki pakistan ke pradhanmantri ne apane bhartiya samakaksh ke liye koi bhi apmanjanak tippanee nahin kii
 According to Hamid Mir, Nawaz Sharif wanted to say that if India has any problem with Pakistan, then both countries can talk about it among themselves
 aise muddon ko america ke raashtrapati baraak obama ke saamne pesh karne kaa kya matlab he
 Mir, Nawaz said this lightly and in keeping with the same mood, i said this thing to the countryside woman on TV
 sharif ne is tarah kaa shabd istemaal nahin kiya tha
 When Sharif came to know about the ruckus on his statement after a breakfast meeting with journalists, he immediately made up for it
 pakistan ke videsh sachiv jaleel abbaas jilani ko iskaa jimmaa saunpa gaya
 According to sources, Geelani contacted India's National Security Advisor Shivshankar Menon who visited the US with the Prime Minister and made it clear that Nawaz Sharif has not made any wrong remarks for Manmohan Singh
 lekin yahaan bharat main is tippanee par tab rajnatik sargarmi tej ho gai, jab ravivaar ko dilli main ek rajnatik raily main bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ne iskaa hawala diya
 Modi said that what is the position of Nawaz Sharif, who should use such a derogatory tone for the Prime Minister of India

 According to a research, employees use social media during work for many reasons
 inamen se ek badi or sabase aam vajah yah hoti he ki ve kuch der ke liye kaam se brake lete hue khud ko rifresh karnaa chaahate hai
 According to a 2003 research conducted by Pew Research St
 on adults in the United States, about 34 percent of those involved said they used social media to relieve mental fatigue from work
 survey ke mutabik, soshal netwarking digital plateform logon ko kaam kii quality sudhaarney kaa mauka dete hai
 At the same time, they can prove more useful for their company by maintaining better relations with their fellow employees

 Overall 65 per cent of the people believe that their use of social media improves their work because it gives them new information and most importantly, they can put their mind to work again by removing their mental fatigue

 The agitation for formation of government in Maharashtra can be discussed in Tejashiv sena-ncp-congress
 Discussion on the formula of one CM, two deputy cms, Maharashtra is waiting for its new state government after the results of the assembly elections
 raashtrapati shashan lag chukaa he lekin raajnneetik halchal badhati ja rahi he
 The Shiv Sena, which has left the BJP, is now seen going with the Congress and the NCP and there is also talk of a common program for government formation among the three parties, but there are still two issues on which the matter is stuck and in detail
 Discussion remains to be done
 maharashtra main ensipi-congress ke saath nunatam saajha kaarykram banane main juty shivasena kii baat do muddon par atakati nazar aa rahi he
 
 
 1
 shivasena kii maang he ki vir saavarkar ko bharat ratna mili2
 The congress-ncp demands that Muslims get 5 per cent reservation, saying that the Shiv Sena does politics of Hindutva completely, but something has to be sacrificed with the congress-ncp
 vidhansabha chunaav ho yaa phir loksabhaa chunaav, lagaataar shivasena kii taraf se vir saavarkar ko bharat ratna dene kii maang kii he
 But the congress-ncp has consistently considered Veer Savarkar as a controversial character and associated his name with those who had conspired to assassinate Mahatma Gandhi
 vahiin duusari ore agar muslim aarakshan kii baat karen, to shivasena is mudde kaa virodh karti ai he or rajya main maratha aarakshan ko badhaava dene kii baat karti ai he
 In such a situation, everyone will now also keep an eye on how the issues on which the matter is stuck are fulfilled and who sacrifices their claim
 is formule se ban sakati he sarkaar!bataa den ki shuukravaar ko hi ek formula saamne aayaa he jiske dam par shivasena-ensipi or congress kii sarkaar ban sakati he
 Under this, Shiv Sena can get the post of Chief Minister for five years, while ncp-congress can get the post of Deputy CM
 iske alaava 14-14-12 ke formule se mantri pad kaa bantwaaraa ho saktaa he
 Talk made in Maharashtra! Shiv Sena will be the CM, ministers will be on 14-14-12 formula madhya pradesh ke reva main andhi aasthaa or andhvishwaas ke chalate ek ladki ne apane hi haathon apni jeebh kaat lee
 After biting the tongue, the girl lay unconscious for 5 hours and the devotees were engaged in devotional prayers and worship
 devi mandir main ladki ne kaati jeebhjibh kaatane kaa hairaan karne vaala ye maamla reva kerani talab mandirka he
 On Wednesday, a girl named Anita Dwivedi came here to see the Goddess and after offering pooja, she cut the tongue with the blade and offered it to the goddess, Anita fainted soon after cutting the tongue
 aanan-fanan me pujari ne anitha ke ghar waalon ko soochna di, lekin doctor yaa police ko bulaane kii bajaay vahaan maujuud logon ko bhajan karne ko kaha
 The girl lay unconscious for 5 hours
 During this entire incident, Anita remained unconscious in the temple for about five hours
 ab anitha ne apane hi haathon jeebh kaati ye philhal kisi ko nahin pataa
 But after spending about five hours without any pain, Anita went home with her family members
 lagbhag saathe paanch ghante tak aasthaa kaa yah khel devi mandir main chalata rahaa or swasthya mahakama or police haath par haath dhare baithi rahi
 The police also felt helpless towards this faith
 pehle bhi mandir main chadhaai gai he jeebhriva ke is devi mandir main aksar bhakt apanimanyataonko lekar jeebh chadhaate rahe hai
 People believe that offering their tongues here fulfills their wishes
 isse pehle bhi navaratri or anya tyoharon main devi maa ko bhakt apni jeebh chadhaate hai or bhakton kii is andhi aasthaa yaa yun kahen ki junun ke aage sab bebas nader aate hai

 The government is in the mood to resume the tenth board examinations
 desh kii sabase badi pariksha karaane vaali sanstha central board of secondary ajukeshan (CBSE) ko iske babat suchit kiya gaya he
 Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar will make its official announcement on 25 October
 mantri banane ke baad se yah unki pehali badi ghoshnaa he
 Tenth board examinations are expected to start from 2018
 paanchavin class tak no ditension
 
 
 They will also declare a 'no Detention' policy for students up to the fifth
 rajya ise apane suvidhanusaar aathvin kaksha tak lagu kar sakenge
 However, they will have to undergo re-examinations to promote the failing students in the next class
 gauratlab he ki saal 2010 main board parikshaon ko khatm kar saal bhar ke aadhaar pargrading kii suvidhashuru kii gai thi
 The reasoning behind this was that the grading system would reduce the pressure on the students
 in board parikshaon kii shuruyaat ke peeche rajya or bacchon ke mata-pita kii ore se aane vaali pratikriyaayein thim
 They say that the level of studies has dropped because of these board examinations not being conducted
 haalanki is dauraan kii gai research kii maane to nattejey drop out kam hone kii ore ishaara karte hai
 Needed for further preparation 
 
 dasvin board parikshaon ke paksh main vakaalat karne vaale ise aage kii board parikshaon kii taiyaari ke liye mahatvapurn maanate hai
 The policy of not stopping students has also reduced the rights of teachers
 is bich gyarahavin class main kai students fail hue to dasvin board parikshaon kii maang or bhi teji se uthne lagi
 The Ministry of Human Resources is calling this step its Diwali gift in the field of education
 ve alag-alag rajyon ke shiksha mantriyon or central adwijuri board of ajukeshan (CABE) ke saath hone vaali baithkon ke baad ve antim ghoshnaa karenge
 They also say that the government and the board's move has not yielded the expected results
 dropaut rokane ke liye NCERT nahin he saathaj bhale hi 'no ditension' kaa formula ulajhaa hua lagata ho, magar yah rajya kaa maamla he ki ve class paanch, chah, saat or aath main fail hone vaale students ko phir se usee class main rokna chaahate hai
 However, they will make 'repeat examination' compulsory
 vahi ensiiarti (NCERT) bhi 'no ditension' ke hataae jane ke khilaaf he
 If the legislature does not need to interfere in the resumption of Class x board examinations, then section 16 of the Right to Education Act will have to be amended to implement the process of withholding students in case of failure
 supreme court ne bhi 'no ditension' mudde par sahmati jataayi he
 In the case of Unaided Rajasthani Private School Barx Union of India, the Supreme Court has said that the removal from classes and retraining students will increase the dropout rate and push this campaign

 noida ke posh ilaakon main in dinon hai states vaale chor dhooma machaa rahe hai
 He is not an ordinary thief but a vicious vampire
 jo mauka dekhakar bada haath saaf kar jate hai
 His handiwork was revealed after a BMW car was stolen from Noida
 maamla beeti 15 july kaa he
 Time 7: 13 in the morning

 a boy sitting on the back seat of the car got down from the car and entered Ritesh's house
 wo gailaree se hote hue makaan main gaya
 Two minutes later, the boy came out of the house
 or car main driving seat par baithe apane saathi se batkar dobaaraa ghar main daakhil hua
 After a while the boy came back outside the house

 a CCTV camera mounted on the gate of Ritesh's house showed the BMW car going towards Atta
 police bhi hairaan thi ki posh sector main koi itani aasaani se chori kii vaardaat ko anjaam de saktaa he
 When we looked at the footage of all the CCTV cameras installed in the police area, it was found that the thief, who was not an Audi rider, had committed the theft incident in many places
 15 july kii subah kareeb 6:30 baje kaale rang kii audi car sector 17 e kii sadakon par dikhaai di
 Looking at the boys in the car, one cannot guess that these smart boys roaming around with expensive cars had entered the sector with the intention of stealing
 sisitivi camere kii footage main 6 bajkar 39 minute par ek ladkaa audi car se utarkar ek ghar main daakhil hota hua najar aa rahaa he
 He stays there for about two and a half minutes after entering the house and then comes out and takes his Audi car and leaves from there
 darasal, ve us ghar main bhi chori kii niyat se hi daakhil hue the lekin usamen kaamyaab nahin ho paae
 Despite this, he kept roaming the streets of Sector 17A
 uske baad 7 bajkar 1 minute par vahi audi car sisitivi camere main najar aati he
 The car stops on the side of the road
 kareeb do minute baad gaadi ke peeche vaali sadak se vahi ladkaa aata hua dikhaai detaa he jo pehle gaadi se utarkar ek or ghar main daakhil hua tha
 This time a bag hangs over his shoulder
 wo bag ko gaadi kii back seat par rakh detaa he or phir car kaa aglaa darwaja kholkar car chalaa rahe apane saathi se kuch baat karata he
 After talking for a while, he sits on the back seat of the car
 car thodi der tak vahi khadi rahati he or phir chal detii he
 But the car stops once again after walking a bit
 sisitivi camere kii footage ke mutabik 7 bajkar 6 minute par chalati hui audi car kaa darwaja ek baar phir khulata he
 The boy sitting on the back seat of the car gets down from the car and enters a house
 is bich car chalaa rahaa ladkaa car ko reverse kar sadak ke kinare laga detaa he
 This time too, the car remains standing for about two minutes
 ek baar phir vahi ladkaa car ke najadik aata hua dikhataa he
 But this time his hands are empty, he opens the door to the back seat of the car
 car ek baar phir sector 17 e kii sadakon par chalane lag jaati he
 According to the CCTV camera footage, only after this, the thief Ritesh escaped from KBMW Chura
 police ne maamla darj kar liya he
 Now these vicious miscreants are being searched
 abhi tak police ke haath khaali he

 (input bhashaa se) The Shiv Sena has once attacked Asaduddin Owaisi's party over the performance of All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) in the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation elections
 ovaisi bandhuon ke bheje main ghusaa he pakistan kaa haraa rangah shivasenaparty ne apane mukhpatr saamana main likhaa he ki in chunaavon main bhagava jarur laharaaya, lekin eimm kii fadafadaahat aane waalon main dinon main khatre ke sanket hai
 MIM also supported Dalits along with Muslims, it could be a threat to Ambedkar movement and Hindus
 ‘saamana’ ke sampadak, ovaisi ke khilaaf kesalekh ke mukhya ansh
 
 
 1
 emm ko aurangbad ke musalamaanon se jo takat mili he use chintajanak kahana padegaa
 2
 dharm ke naare dete hue musalamaanon kaa vot bank dharm ke naam par ek ho gaya
 3
 muslim voton ke saath dalit voton ko phodne kii gandi raajnneeti karne kii sajeesh emm ne rachi
 4
 kuch dalit ummidavaar is party ke tikat par chunakar bhi aae
 If sympathy continues in this way, it can prove to be a danger bell not only for social unity but also for Ambedkarite movement
 5
 These 25 candidates of a toxic organization like MIM, which came out, are certainly not good traits
 6
 In Maharashtra, bigotry like MIM are collecting Muslim votes under the banner of Islam
 aise main hinduon ko is chunaav nateezon ko aankh kholkar dekhnaa padegaa
 Hindus will have to devise a one-point policy by forgetting the differences
 aurangabad mahanagar palika chunaav kaa to yahi sabak he

 input: bhashaa Upasana Singh, who plays Bua in Kapil Sharma's comedy show, said goodbye to the show recently
 unka janaa kapil ke liye ek or bada jhatka sabit ho
 Upasana joined Krishna Abhishek's show
 isse pehle sunil grover, navjot singh siddhu sahit kai kalakaar sho chhod chuke hai
 Upasana has given the real reason for Kapil to be away from the show
 unhone aaj tak ko bataaya ki ve apane kirdaar se ub gai thim, isliye unhone is sho ko chhod diya
 She now wants to do something new
 upasna singh ne bataaya kyon chhodana padaa kapil sharma kaa shoupasna ne kaha, mere kirdaar main kuch nayaapan nahin tha
 i was speaking the same dialogue a hundred times
 mere liye kuch nayaa nahin likhaa ja rahaa tha
 i wanted to do something new
 mere kairactor ko aage badhaane kii koi gunjaaish nahin bachi thi
 So i thought it was appropriate to separate from Kapil's show
 haal hi main khabaren ain ki kapil kii beemaari ke chalate unka sho kuch din ke liye band kiya ja rahaa he
 Upasana said that Kapil's health issues never came up during the shooting, he left the show three months ago, so he is not aware of all this
 in vajahon se kamedi sho kaa gira graph, koi or nahin khud kapil hai jimmedaarajab upasna ne poocha gaya ki kya ve kapil ke saath dobaaraa kaam karnaa chahengi? jawaab main upasna boleen, kapil se meri koi buraai nahin he
 If something good is written then i will definitely work with them
 mere kapil se achche sambandh hai
 Sidhu cannot leave from the show due to Archana
 Last days there was also news that the reason for Navjot Singh Sidhu's departure from Kapil's show was to call Archana Puran Singh in his place in the show
 lekin upasna is baat se inkaar karti hai
 He said, i know Sidhu ji well, he can never leave the show due to Archana

 The Modi government is going to work to put its economic policy in front of the country before the elections through this interim budget, based on all the full budgets presented in its tenure
 bhartiya janata party ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar aagaamee aam chunaavon main satta kaa khud ko vipaksh se adhik majboot daavedaar dikhaane kaa kaam karegi
 Therefore, one needs to take a look at all the previous budgets of the Modi government to get an idea of which achievements of the Finance Minister's Budget Speech in the Interim Budget will add to its economic policy
 modi sarkaar kaa paanchvaan bajet (2018-19)yah modi sarkaar kaa aakhri purna bajet tha
 Prior to this budget, the central government had a challenge to face elections in 8 states as well as the Lok Sabha elections at the end of the year
 lihaaja, is bajet ko loklubhaavan banaate hue sarkaar ke saamne apni flagship yojanaon ke liye paryaapt bajtiy praavdhaan karne kii chunauti thi
 However, the budget disappointed the middle class

 At the same time, the challenge before the government was to spend the savings from the weak prices of crude oil in development works
 modi ko kisi mili thi iconomi? chidambaram ke aakhri bajet main chhipi he sacchaiiske alaava is bajet ke jariye sarkaar ko saatven vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko lagu karne ke liye bhi praavdhaan karnaa tha
 Apart from these, there was a serious problem facing the agriculture sector

 In such a situation, the secondpartner feels insecure due to being alone

 gail ne ‘sicks mashin : ai dont like cricket 
 In the book i Love It 'wrote,' Some players are worried about the record
 jab bryan lara us match main 4 ran par out ho gaye the tab vah dressing room main baithkar kitaab pard rahe the 
 After a while, he would go to the balcony, watch the scoreboard and then come and sit
 ramanaresh sarwan unhen dekh rahaa tha
 Every time Brian would come out and see my score, his anxiety would increase
 ' He said, 'when i came during lunch and tea, he did not say anything to me
 koi salaah nahin di ki aise hi khelte raho yaa team ke liye bada score banaao
 When i went back, he came to the dressing room for a while and then came to the balcony for a while to see my score
 ' gail 317 ran par out ho gaye or lara kaa 400 ran kaa ricard nahin tod sake
 This book, written in association with Tom Fordyce, is published by Penguin Random House
 isamen gail ne kuch sansanikhej dastaanon kaa bhi zikr kiya he
 Gayle said that people feel that he is arrogant and not obsessed with cricket
 tippaniyan He wrote, 'people misunderstand things
 shaayad meri ballebaaji kii vajah se kyonki main bahut shot kheltaa hum to unhen lagata he ki main laaparvaah hum
 This is probably what it looks like on TV
 main apane shot kheltaa hum or out ho jaataa hum

 Eight years ago, in the forest of Kolhuva in which Dadua was killed by STF, we went to find the Bundelkhand package
 bundelkhand ke kisaanon ko aatmahatya or sookhe se bachaane ke liye centre sarkaar 7266 karod rupee uttar pradesh or madhya pradesh ke 13 jilon ko diya
 But the bulk of the money went to the pockets of leaders and officials
 kisaanon ko iskaa kitna phayda mila, ye dekhne ke liye banda se kareeb 60 kimi dur atarra tehsil se kolhua ke jangal main chal pade
 On the way, RTI activist and journalist Ashish Sagar told us that Rasin Dam has been built in Rasin village at a cost of Rs 76 crore, which aims to provide water to about 5000 acres of farmland under drought conditions
 is saal monsoon nahin ke baraabar rahaa he
 Therefore first we should take stock of Rasin Dam
 2012 main baandh banakar taiyaar hua
 There was no irrigation department alive on this dam built in the lap of the Vidyachal hills
 rasin gaanv ke naam par is baandh kaa naam rasin baandh rakhaa gaya
 Here we found a farmer named Bhushan whose 12 bighas of land was acquired to build this dam
 inaki jameen kaa muaavja 24 hazaar rupee bighas ke hisaab se mila
 Bhushan told us that it has been more than 3 years since the dam was built but till date this gate has not been opened
 isse lagati naharen sukhi padi he
 Not only this, the water of this dam has not reached the fields of Rasin village till date
 camere ko dekhakar kuch or gaanv vaale aa gaye
 Our eyes stopped on a ruined building
 bataaya gaya ki ye baandh kaa control rum he
 The thieves took the broken windows and doors
 aajkal ye aawaara pashu or nashediyon ke baithne kaa adda bana hua he
 The dam whose control room is in ruins, how it would beat the dry fields, we had understood
 yaheen se kuch duuri par hamen do park dikhaai pade
 Somehow we reached this park after crossing the fatal slope
 gaanv waalon ne bataaya yahaan gautam buddha kii murti lagi thi
 We also found some remains of the Buddha statue after searching a lot in the park
 ashish sagar or shiv narayan ne baqayda use lekar photo khinche
 i could not understand why these parks were built with the money of farmers for two crore rupees
 yahaan lage safed khambon ko pehle main cement kaa maan rahaa tha lekin tabhi meri najar aandhi main gire ek khambe par padi
 It was astonishing to see that these remote looking pillars were of fiber and sand and maurang were filled inside
 park or baandh kii haalat dekhakar mujhe dukh bhi ho rahaa tha or gussa bhi aa rahaa tha
 Ashish told that this is a trailer, the story of the Bundelkhand package is still pending
 yahaan se 30 kimi dur kolhua ke ghaney jangal main chal pade
 We were told that after the killing of Dadua, Thonkia, Badkhadia, a bandit named Babli is still active
 ye sunakar kuch ghabrahat hui, hamane car gaanv main chhod di or paidal patpar pahari naale par bane check dam ko dekhne chal pade
 The comments kolhua ke jangal main jangal vibhaag ne 55 checkdam banaae hai or har ek kii keemat 5 lakh rupee he
 After some distance, a boundary was seen by placing some stones
 hamen bataaya gaya ki paanch lakh kaa check dam yahi he
 Ashish told that the tribals of this place were called and stones of the river were laid
 isse aage badhane par checkdaimanuma cheez bhi nahin mili
 Ashish Sagar told that no one can check the work after coming here, so the money was stolen by making paper check dams
 jab ham lautne lage to kuch kisaan baithe mili
 Farmers told that this year there is no rain at all, so the situation is very bad
 jaanavar agar nahin hon to ham bhukhon mar jaaen
 When plans are made for poor farmers by sitting in closed rooms of AC, then only officers and leaders can be happy
 ye baat hamen samaj aa chuki thi
 i gave the details of four Rosa Yatras of Bundelkhand in three parts
 kisaan or package kii raajnneeti ke bare main thodaa bahut soch main agar badlaav aae to samaj lijiega ki ham kisaan ke liye kuch kar nahin rahe hai bas sochane kii prakriya abhi shuru hui he
 To see how much this benefited the farmers, they walked in the forest of Kolhuva from Atra tehsil, about 60 km from Banda
 raste main artiai kaaryakarta or patrkaar ashish sagar ne hamen bataaya ki rasin gaanv main 76 karod rupee kii laagat se rasin baandh banaaya gaya he jiskaa makasad kareeb 5 hazaar acre khet tak sookhe ke halaat main pani pahunchaana he
 This year the monsoon has been negligible
 isliye pehle hamen rasin baandh kaa jayja lenaa chahie
 The dam was completed in 2012
 vidhyanchal pahadiyon kii god main bane is baandh par sinchai vibhaag kaa koi karinda maujuud nahin tha
 The dam was named Rasin Dam after the village of Rasin
 yahaan hamen bhushan naam ke kisaan mili jinaki 12 bighas zamin kaa adhigrahan is baandh ko banane main kiya gaya tha
 Compensation of their land was given at the rate of 24 thousand bighas
 bhushan ne hamen bataaya ki baandh ko bane 3 saal se zyada ho gaya lekin aaj tak is get nahin khulaa
 The canals adjacent to it are lying dry
 yahi nahin is baandh kaa pani aaj tak rasin gaanv ke kheton main nahin pahunchaa
 Seeing the camera, some more villagers came
 hamaari najar khandharnuma bani ek imaarat par thahar gai
 It was told that this is the control room of the dam
 tuuti khidkiyaan-daravaaje ko chor uthaa le gaye the
 Nowadays it remains a seat of stray animals and addicts
 jis baandh kaa control room badahaal ho chukaa he wo sookhe kheton ko kaise haraa karegaa, hamaari samaj main aa chukaa tha
 At some distance from here, we saw two parks
 kisi tarah jaanaleva dhalaan ko parkar ham is park pahunche
 The villagers told that a statue of Gautam Buddha was installed here
 park main bahut khojane par buddha kii pratimaa ke kuch avshesh hamen bhi mili
 Ashish Sagar and Shiva Narayan took photographs with him
 meri samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha ki do karod rupee main aakhir kisaanon ke paise se ye park kyon banawaye gaye
 At first i was considering the white pillars here as cement, but then i saw a pillar falling in the storm
 ye dekhakar hairaan rah gaya ki dur se cement ke dikhne vaale ye khambe fibre ke the or iske andar baaluu or maurang ko bhar diya gaya tha
 Seeing the condition of the park and the dam, i was also sad and angry
 ashish ne bataaya ki ye to trailor he, bundelkhand package kii kahani abhi baaki he
 Walked 30 km from here in the dense forest of Kolhuva
 hamen bataaya gaya ki dadua, thonkia, badkhadia ke maare jane ke baad abhi bubbly naam kaa ek daaku sakriy he
 Hearing this, there was some panic, we left the car in the village and went to see the check dam on the footpath on the footpath
 tippaniyan In the forest of Kolhuva, the forest department has made 55 check dams and each one is worth Rs 5 lakh
 kuch dur aage chalakar kuch pathar rakhkar ek hadabandi dekhne ko mili
 We were told that this is the check dam of five lakhs
 ashish ne bataaya ki yaheen ke adivaasiyon ko bulaakar nadi ke pathar rakh die gaye
 On proceeding from this, the checkdanuma thing was not found
 ashish sagar ne bataaya ki yahaan aakar koi kaam ko check nahin kar saktaa lihaaja kagaji checkdam banaakar paisa dakaar liya gaya
 When we started returning, we met some farmers sitting
 kisaanon ne bataaya ki is saal barish bilkul nahin hui lihaaja halaat kaaphi kharaab hai
 If animals are not there then we die of hunger
 jab badahaal kisaanon ke liye yojanaayen asi ke band kamaron main baithkar bane to usase khushhaal keval adhikari or netaa ho sakate hai
 We had understood this
 bundelkhand ke chaar roza yatra kaa vivaran maine teen bhaag main diya
 If there is a change in the mindset about the politics of the farmer and the package, then we will understand that we are not doing anything for the farmer, but the process of thinking has just started

 It was astonishing to see that these remote looking pillars were of fiber and sand and maurang were filled inside

 Ashish told that this is a trailer, the story of the Bundelkhand package is still pending

 Farmers told that this year there is no rain at all, so the situation is very bad

 Walked 30 km from here in the dense forest of Kolhuva

 We had understood this

 If there is a change in the mindset about the politics of the farmer and the package, then we will understand that we are not doing anything for the farmer, but the process of thinking has just started

 sheersh variya somdev devvarman ne mushkil halaaton se ubarte hue pehle daur main jeet darj kii jabaki liender pes or mahesh bhupati kii anbhavi jodi ne yugal varg main sidhe seton main jeet ke saath rashtramandal khelon kii tennis spardhaa main bharat kaa dabadabaa banaaya
 Paes and Bhupathi, popularly known as 'indian Express', defeated Sri Lanka's Tangaraja Dinesh Kantan and Amresh Jayavikrame 6-3, 6-3 in an hour and eight minutes to advance to the quarter-finals
 ab tak atipi suchi main jagah banane main vifal rahi srilankai jodi ke paas pes or bhupati kii diggaj jodi kaa koi jawaab nahin tha jinhone milakar 23 grandslam khitaab jite hai
 The Sri Lankan duo, however, tried to take on the Indian pair but could not succeed
 nirupama sanjeev or pujashri kii mahila yugal jodi bhi aminath irupha maahir or aminath malila solih par 6-0, 6-1 kii jeet ke saath antim aath main pahunchi
 Somdev gave India a winning start by defeating Devin Malings of the Bahamas 6-4, 6-2 in straight sets to advance to the pre-quarterfinals of men's singles tennis
 malings ne pehle set main 4-1 kii badhat banaakar gharelu darshakon ko hairaan kar diya lekin somdev ne iske baad vaapasi karte hue lagaataar paanch game jitkar set jeet liya
 The left-handed Malingas put Somdev in trouble early on with his strong forehand, but after that the scorching heat began to trouble the Bahamas player and the muscles began to stretch
 malings ne pehle set ke saatven game main medical time out liya or yaheen se match kaa rukh somdev ke paksh main mudane laga
 The Bahamas player then made many spontaneous mistakes
 unke do forehand baahar gayi jisase somdev ko do brake point mili or bhartiya khilaadi ne duusare maukey bacand vinar ke saath set apane naam kiya
 Somdev also benefited from Malings' mistake in the second set when the Indian player got a break from his double fault in the third game
 bahamas ke khilaadi ne haalanki vaapasi karte hue chathe game main do brake point hasil kiye lekin somdev ne pehla es jabaki doosraa forehand vinar ke saath bachaa liya
 Somdev then broke Malings' service once again to take a 5-2 lead and then took the second set and the match
 loktantr kii ham jab bhi baat karte hai, hamaara dhyaan raajnneetik dal or unke netaaon kii taraf hi jaataa he
 Is also natural
 lekin aap yah bhi dekh sakate hai ki jab chunaav samaapt ho jaataa he to wo koun log hai jo awaz uthaane kaa saahas karte hai, satta se sidhe takaraate hai
 You will find that the leaders are seen in the press conference, but on the road, various groups of common people are taking on the power of governments and institutions
 raajnneeti se niraash hote vakt bhi ham inaki taraf nahin dekhte
 It may be that we feel that what we have to do with the lathi account teachers, what should we take from the parents who have suffered the fees increase, what we have from those seeking employment
 haalanki aap in sabamein hote hai lekin dekhne or sochane kii training aisi ho gai he ki party ke baahar aap kisi ko netaa kii tarah dekhte hi nahin hai
 You and us too
 ham sab yah maan chuke hai ki loktantr ke liye sangharsh raajnneetik dalon ke mukhyalayon se hi hota he
 Today, in all the districts of the country, parents are giving memorandum to all the officials by forming small groups without the support of any political party
 bahut kuch hasil nahin ho rahaa, magar inaki ladaai is bharam ko tod rahi he ki privet skool ke naam khuli ye dukaane sab kuch acha hi kar rahi hai
 Taking advantage of the parents' compulsion, schools are imposing a variety of conditions on them
 ek kism kii maansik or aarthik gulaami main rahane ke liye majaboor kar rahe hai
 Which leader of which party is supporting the parents who are protesting against this? So are these people not fighting their battles without the help of any leader
 ludhiana main hi ye koun log hai jo pradarshan kar rahe hai, dilli ghaziabad, noida ke tamaam skulon ke baahar pradarshan karne vaale maa-baap main ham kabhi netritv kii sambhaavna nahin khojate hai
 We do not explore the possibility of leadership in parents sitting on a fast against arbitrariness of schools at Azad Maidan in Mumbai
 raajnneetik dalon main netaa nazar nahin aata he to rone lagate hai ki desh koun chalaaegaa
 If the leaders want in a minute, then the rigging of private schools can be stopped
 ve chahen to sarkari skool bhi sudhar sakate hai magar sabko pataa he antim lakshya note bananaa he
 To do as much in the name of work so as to create a headline in the media that the school was visited
 teacher ko hadakaa liya gaya, phir skulon main khaali shikshakon ke hajaaron padon ke sawaal, bench se lekar kitabon ke sawaal kahin kho jate hai
 You will see that our today's politics is doing the same so that images can be generated for uploading in whatsapp or Facebook
 taaki kaam jitna ho nahin, usase kahin zyaada lage ki haa kuch ho rahaa he
 Now several months have passed, with the law claiming to rein in the builders
 iske baad bhi har ravivaar ko noida greater noida main hi flats kareedne waalon kaa pradarshan kyon jari he
 Have you seen any political party leader perform with them in the sun on Sunday? ve nahin dikhenge haa apane ghar main bulaakaar mulaakaat karte hue zarur dikhenge jisaki tasviir media main pradarshan karne vaale logon se kahin zyaada chhapati he
 After all, how does a leader become a hero or a public leader in the struggle created by the people
 use to aap hi banaate hai
 Yet this series of demonstrations against powerful builders does not raise hopes that one can snatch democracy no matter how much power it acquires
 ye koun log hai jo bilderon se loha le rahe hai ,sochiega kabhi inke bare main
 Schools and real estate are strongholds where leaders are killed
 iske zarie logon kaa hausala post kiya gaya
 Even after their earnings are being grabbed, only a small number of people are right but there are some people who are raising their voice
 in logon ko dekhte hue ummiido se labalab ho janaa chahie
 Taking time away from the cow and the temple, think about where the leader is when there is a public issue
 aisa nahin ki netaa ke mudde janata ke nahin hote, bas netaaon ke muddon ko janata tay nahin karti he
 They have their own way
 kisaan paidal march karenge to do tasviir nahin chhapegi, tivi par do minute footage nahin dikhegaa, magar kisaanon ko lekar bade raajnneetik dal ke netaa padayatra karenge to uskaa ghanton sidhaa prasaaran kiya jayega or vaahvahee hogi ki kisaanon kii takalif samajhane vaala netaa aa gaya he
 It is all sustained by your blessings
 ise kisi bahari ne nahin balki aapane banaaya he
 There is a picture, of March 2015, from Jharkhand
 ek kagaz par log pakhaana kar rahe hai, tatti kar rahe hai
 In English these days it is called washroom because the toilet or latrine now sounds as ugly as a toilet or a pakhana
 yah tasviir he naksal prabhavit latehar ke barbadih blaak aphis kii jahaan saath gaanv ke log jamaa hue the
 So what are you doing while plucking it on paper
 do saal pehle is tarkeeb se in kisaanon ne bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon kaa virodh kiya tha
 Their goal was to shock our habit of watching and not watching the performances
 hamaare sahyogi alok pandey ne tab likhaa tha ki yah idia kisi piaar yaa event management company kii taraf se nahin aayaa tha balki adivasee samaaj ke netao kii moulik soch thi
 They wanted to tell how bad the land acquisition law is
 aam logon ke pradarshnon or netaaon ke aayojanon main kitni rachanaatmakataa aa gai he
 Although there is a big difference in the creativity of both, there is a difference in the morality of both, but change has already taken place
 pehle padayatra hua karti thi, phir wo rathyatra hui, phir wo road sho hua or ab road sho bhi badal gaya he
 Thousands of bikes range from laser lights
 sab kuch is tarah se hone laga he jaise raajnneeti mumbai ke mehboob studio main filmai ja rahi he
 Switzerland is there, England is there
 netaaon ke pradarshan ab tivi par prasaaran ke hisaab se hote hai
 His camera has changed to the angle so that you have a deep impact on your mind
 garibi dur karne vaale or garibi jhelkar manch par pahunche netaaon ke kapade tak diziner hai, mahange hai
 You also like all this
 lekin gaur se dekhie aapke tivi screen par aane ke liye netaa yaa aayojan main kitni teji se badlaav aa rahe hai
 a few years ago when Satyagraha was going on day and night in Ramlila Maidan, some farmers got down to perform water satyagraha in Narmada River
 213 logon ne 32 dinon tak qamar bhar pani main khadey hokar pradarshan kiya tha
 His legs were damaged
 media or sarkaar kaa dhyaan aakarshith karne ke liye aam logon ko kya-kya karnaa pad rahaa he
 He continued to enrich this democracy through his creativity
 kabhi jeet jate hai, kabhi haar bhi jate hai
 On 14 March, 134 farmers from Tamil Nadu arrived in Delhi
 tamilnadu main bhayankar sookhaa he, 140 saal main aisa sookhaa kisi ne nahin dekha, magar vahaan ke netaa satta kaa khel khel rahe hai
 The farmers came to Delhi seeking compensation and loan waiver
 hamane 17 march ko prime time kiya tha ki kis tarah hindi bhashi pradesh main aakar in kisaanon ne apni deh ko hi bhashaa main badal diya
 Hardly anyone who speaks Hindi among them
 vaise hindi bol pate tab bhi koi guarantee nahin he ki media or sarkaar sunati hi
 Leave this aspect now, see how these farmers have given their performance a new height every day
 ye pradarshnon kii rachanaatmakataa kaa daur he
 He is not a farmer, he is a real poet
 jab ye stesan par utre the tabaki ek tasviir he
 As soon as she got down from the station, she did a small gathering there
 sabko nirdesh diya ki kahaan janaa he kya karnaa he or phir jantar mantar ke liye chal die
 In a city where they had to compete with the media whose priorities are fixed for other reasons
 jaldi hi ye log har din khud hi ghatana banane lage
 First of all, he himself was half-hearted
 haath main katoraa liya or us par begar likh diya
 With a half-covered body, these farmers started demanding loan waiver
 inke gale main narmund kii maala bhi thi
 They said that this skull belonged to those farmers who committed suicide by getting fed up with debt
 40 din se ye jantar mantar par pradarshan kar rahe hai
 134 farmers came, many of whom fell back after falling ill, but from there a new batch of hundred farmers is coming to Delhi soon
 hamane sochaa ki kyon na inke pradarshnon kii ek suchi banaate hai
 Let us see what they do as the days go by
 apni ladaai ko praasangik or rochak banaae rakhana bhi mul sangharsh se zyaada bada sangharsh he
 Among these farmers, there is also a young man of 25 years and an old farmer of 75 years
 hamane 17 march ke prime time main inke pradarshan ko shaamil kiya tha
 The next day two farmers climbed the tree and tried to hang it, but the police stopped the incident in time
 tisare din inkaa pradarshan kuch or ho gaya
 The peasants took off their clothes and covered the body with leaves
 chauthe din puure sharir ko paint kar liya
 On the sixth day, he started performing a garland of Rudraksha
 saatven, aathven or naunve din inhone kuch alag nahin kiya
 Jantar continued to perform at Mantar
 10 wein din supreme court tak langot main padayatra kii, 11 wein din jantar mantar par kutta ban gaye or bhaunkkar pradarshan karne lage
 On the 12th day, a farmer became a corpse, the peasants sat around the corpse and started ringing, crying, and also took out the funeral procession of the corpse made of the corpse
 13 wein din ro-rokar pradarshan karne lage
 Went to 14th Delhi railway station and took rats from there
 aap kalpana kiijie, patariyon par daudte chuhon ko pakadana or unhen lekar aana or phir daant se dabaanaa
 What would have been easier? Would it have been just his theatricality? There are other ways to be dramatic, why would anyone catch a mouse? On the 15th day he did a play
 tamaam mantriyon ke daftar bhi gaye, tamilnadu se modi sarkaar main mantri bhi aae, rahul gandhi bhi gaye or bahut se saamaanya log bhi gaye
 But more than coming, they are more interested in getting their point heard
 inkaa kahana he ki kuch ho jaae, dilli se ladaai jitkar jaaenge
 They say that if the government will sit in the train, then they will pull the chain, but even then they will not get off, then they will jump from the moving train
 ab to in kisaanon kaa kahana he ki ve peshaab pine ja rahe hai
 Not only this, he also played a play on Jantar Mantar
 isamen pradhanmantri ko chaabuk maarthe hue dikhaaya gaya or kisaan gandhi kaa mukhauta pahanakar zamin par kodaa khate rahe or madad maangate rahe
 It was the 15th day of his performance
 ham kah sakate hai ki inkaa pradarshan vicitra hota ja rahaa he
 But when did we all imagine the performance in this way
 lekin ek baat yaad rakhiegaa
 Event managers sitting at a contract for lakhs of leaders will create their own ideas
 ab ve kisi sarkaar yaa raajnneetik dal ke khilaaf pradarshan karenge to isi tarah rose-rose idia nikaalenge
 We will do strange things and turn them into events
 abhi aapako lag rahaa he ki inke pradarshan par kisi kaa dhyaan nahin he, magar jaldi hi koi inke pradarshan se nayaa idia nikaalane vaala he
 Ate snake meat on 16th day
 tamilnadu se saanp laayaa gaya tha
 Covered the head and eyes with a black cloth on the 17th day
 18 wein din katoraa lekar bhikhaari ban gaye
 On the 19th day, shaved half the head and half the mustache
 21 wein din puri moonch saaf kar di or 22 wein din kisaanon ke sar ke bal khadey ho gaye
 The movement is led by a 70-year-old lawyer
 inkaa kahana he ki ye pichley saal bhi dilli aae the
 The farmers of Tamil Nadu were told the plight but nobody cared
 ve zarur dilli main pradarshan kar rahe hai magar tamilnadu kii raajnneetik gatividhiyon ko dekhakar nahin lagata ki vahaan ke vidhayakon yaa sarkaar ko kisaanon kii chintaa he
 Now the 23rd day had arrived
 inkaa pradarshan kuch or rup le chukaa tha
 On the 24th, these farmers covered themselves with cloth
 25 wein din ek aadmi pradhanmantri ban gaya or kisaan apni hatheli katkar khun unke charnon main arpit karne laga
 Hunger strike on 26th day
 27 wein din gale main faansee daalkar pradarshan karne lage
 His performance on the 28th and 29th was shocking
 kisi ne kalpana nahin kii thi ki pradhanmantri karyaalay main apana gyaapan dekar lautate vakt ye nirvastr ho jaaenge or pradarshan karne lagenge
 As the days passed the stubbornness of these farmers increased
 chalis hazaar karod kii madad raashi kii maang he inaki
 It is difficult for any government
 centre sarkaar ne bhi 2000 karod se adhik kii madad kaa elaan to kiya hi he magar chalis hazaar karod vah de sakegi, ham andaaza to kar hi sakate hai
 What he did on the 29th was even more difficult
 khuli sadak par chaaval ko chadar kii tarah bicha diya
 Put dal on it and started eating
 aap or ham kabhi is tarah se nahin kha sakate, kisi duusare ko khate dekh bhi nahin sakate
 On the 30th day, he wrote a demand on the chest and back of the body he had changed into language
 blike board ban gaye
 We do not have information on the 31st day
 32 wein din in kisaanon ne sari pahanakar pradarshan kiya
 Keep in mind - dead bodies were made, nude, mustache turned and now started wearing saris
 in kisaanon ne bataaya ki ek kisaan ne patni kaa mangalsutra girvee rakhkar karz liya tha
 If he could not repay the loan, the moneylender took Mangalasutra
 is seen ko kisaanon ne jantar mantar par doharaaya
 Wearing thread threads started to perform
 media report ke anusaar rajya ke sahakaarita bainkon se liye gaye 5,780 karod ke karz vahaan kii sarkaar ne maaf kar die hai
 The High Court has also said that the debt of the farmers of Tamil Nadu should be waived
 is baar tamilnadu main pichley 140 saal main sabase kam barish hui he
 Last year, it received 170 mm of rainfall, while the average rainfall is 437 mm
 kai zile aise hai jahaan 60 fisadi kam barish hui he
 There is a water crisis in many areas of the state
 80 fisadi kisaan, chote kisaan hai
 You may have heard in Tamil Nadu that cheap food is being given
 kisaanon ko sasti daron par anaaj bhi diya jaataa he
 Why farmers are committing suicide even after this
 kyonki karz kaa boj unki seemaa ko paar kar gaya he
 On the 34th day the peasants became women, broke the bangle and began to perform
 37 wein din kisaanon ne fata hua kurta pahan liya
 Became crazy
 ve ab pagal banakar pradarshan karne lage
 The comments aap kah sakate hai ki kisaanon ke in pradarshnon main atvaad he, vicitra bhi hai, lekin yah bhi to dekhie ki aam kisaan apni baat ko lekar kaise lard rahaa he
 What methods are being devised to fight
 jantar mantar par hi unka ghar bas gaya he
 We are not going to leave till the demand is met, so spend the night there, cook there
 aasapaas se log madad bhi karne aa rahe hai
 Someone is giving financial help and some is giving moral help
 lekin inke pradarshnon main koi jor shor se shaamil nahin he
 The leaders have gone to the minister, but the formalities of going have been recorded, they have been filled
 kisaan chakravyuuh main fanse hai
 It is not that governments do nothing but they do not do enough
 kisaanon ne jo rachanaatmakataa dikhaai he usase unki bechaini samaj main aati he
 Some people will also be condemning why so much extremism
 kai baar karunaa dikhaani chahie
 One should try to understand why someone is pressing a mouse in their mouth, eating pulses and rice on the ground
 wo kya kahana chahta he, kya paanaa chahta he
 Farmers need similar stubbornness and creativity to overcome their problems
 pradarshan ke liye bhi or kheti ke taur tareeke badal dene ke liye bhi
 
 
 
 aisa hi jor lagaana hoga mahangi kheti ke chakra se nikalne ke liye

 aam logon ke pradarshnon or netaaon ke aayojanon main kitni rachanaatmakataa aa gai he
 Although there is a big difference in the creativity of both, there is a difference in the morality of both, but change has already taken place
 pehle padayatra hua karti thi, phir wo rathyatra hui, phir wo road sho hua or ab road sho bhi badal gaya he
 Thousands of bikes range from laser lights
 sab kuch is tarah se hone laga he jaise raajnneeti mumbai ke mehboob studio main filmai ja rahi he
 Switzerland is there, England is there
 netaaon ke pradarshan ab tivi par prasaaran ke hisaab se hote hai
 His camera has changed to the angle so that you have a deep impact on your mind
 garibi dur karne vaale or garibi jhelkar manch par pahunche netaaon ke kapade tak diziner hai, mahange hai
 You also like all this
 lekin gaur se dekhie aapke tivi screen par aane ke liye netaa yaa aayojan main kitni teji se badlaav aa rahe hai
 a few years ago when Satyagraha was going on day and night in Ramlila Maidan, some farmers got down to perform water satyagraha in Narmada River
 213 logon ne 32 dinon tak qamar bhar pani main khadey hokar pradarshan kiya tha
 His legs were damaged
 media or sarkaar kaa dhyaan aakarshith karne ke liye aam logon ko kya-kya karnaa pad rahaa he
 He continued to enrich this democracy through his creativity
 kabhi jeet jate hai, kabhi haar bhi jate hai
 On 14 March, 134 farmers from Tamil Nadu arrived in Delhi
 tamilnadu main bhayankar sookhaa he, 140 saal main aisa sookhaa kisi ne nahin dekha, magar vahaan ke netaa satta kaa khel khel rahe hai
 The farmers came to Delhi seeking compensation and loan waiver
 hamane 17 march ko prime time kiya tha ki kis tarah hindi bhashi pradesh main aakar in kisaanon ne apni deh ko hi bhashaa main badal diya
 Hardly anyone who speaks Hindi among them
 vaise hindi bol pate tab bhi koi guarantee nahin he ki media or sarkaar sunati hi
 Leave this aspect now, see how these farmers have given their performance a new height every day
 ye pradarshnon kii rachanaatmakataa kaa daur he
 He is not a farmer, he is a real poet
 jab ye stesan par utre the tabaki ek tasviir he
 As soon as she got down from the station, she did a small gathering there
 sabko nirdesh diya ki kahaan janaa he kya karnaa he or phir jantar mantar ke liye chal die
 In a city where they had to compete with the media whose priorities are fixed for other reasons
 jaldi hi ye log har din khud hi ghatana banane lage
 First of all, he himself was half-hearted
 haath main katoraa liya or us par begar likh diya
 With a half-covered body, these farmers started demanding loan waiver
 inke gale main narmund kii maala bhi thi
 They said that this skull belonged to those farmers who committed suicide by getting fed up with debt
 40 din se ye jantar mantar par pradarshan kar rahe hai
 134 farmers came, many of whom fell back after falling ill, but from there a new batch of hundred farmers is coming to Delhi soon
 hamane sochaa ki kyon na inke pradarshnon kii ek suchi banaate hai
 Let us see what they do as the days go by
 apni ladaai ko praasangik or rochak banaae rakhana bhi mul sangharsh se zyaada bada sangharsh he
 Among these farmers, there is also a young man of 25 years and an old farmer of 75 years
 hamane 17 march ke prime time main inke pradarshan ko shaamil kiya tha
 The next day two farmers climbed the tree and tried to hang it, but the police stopped the incident in time
 tisare din inkaa pradarshan kuch or ho gaya
 The peasants took off their clothes and covered the body with leaves
 chauthe din puure sharir ko paint kar liya
 On the sixth day, he started performing a garland of Rudraksha
 saatven, aathven or naunve din inhone kuch alag nahin kiya
 Jantar continued to perform at Mantar
 10 wein din supreme court tak langot main padayatra kii, 11 wein din jantar mantar par kutta ban gaye or bhaunkkar pradarshan karne lage
 On the 12th day, a farmer became a corpse, the peasants sat around the corpse and started ringing, crying, and also took out the funeral procession of the corpse made of the corpse
 13 wein din ro-rokar pradarshan karne lage
 Went to 14th Delhi railway station and took rats from there
 aap kalpana kiijie, patariyon par daudte chuhon ko pakadana or unhen lekar aana or phir daant se dabaanaa
 What would have been easier? Would it have been just his theatricality? There are other ways to be dramatic, why would anyone catch a mouse? On the 15th day he did a play
 tamaam mantriyon ke daftar bhi gaye, tamilnadu se modi sarkaar main mantri bhi aae, rahul gandhi bhi gaye or bahut se saamaanya log bhi gaye
 But more than coming, they are more interested in getting their point heard
 inkaa kahana he ki kuch ho jaae, dilli se ladaai jitkar jaaenge
 They say that if the government will sit in the train, then they will pull the chain, but even then they will not get off, then they will jump from the moving train
 ab to in kisaanon kaa kahana he ki ve peshaab pine ja rahe hai
 Not only this, he also played a play on Jantar Mantar
 isamen pradhanmantri ko chaabuk maarthe hue dikhaaya gaya or kisaan gandhi kaa mukhauta pahanakar zamin par kodaa khate rahe or madad maangate rahe
 It was the 15th day of his performance
 ham kah sakate hai ki inkaa pradarshan vicitra hota ja rahaa he
 But when did we all imagine the performance in this way
 lekin ek baat yaad rakhiegaa
 Event managers sitting at a contract for lakhs of leaders will create their own ideas
 ab ve kisi sarkaar yaa raajnneetik dal ke khilaaf pradarshan karenge to isi tarah rose-rose idia nikaalenge
 We will do strange things and turn them into events
 abhi aapako lag rahaa he ki inke pradarshan par kisi kaa dhyaan nahin he, magar jaldi hi koi inke pradarshan se nayaa idia nikaalane vaala he
 Ate snake meat on 16th day
 tamilnadu se saanp laayaa gaya tha
 Covered the head and eyes with a black cloth on the 17th day
 18 wein din katoraa lekar bhikhaari ban gaye
 On the 19th day, shaved half the head and half the mustache
 21 wein din puri moonch saaf kar di or 22 wein din kisaanon ke sar ke bal khadey ho gaye
 The movement is led by a 70-year-old lawyer
 inkaa kahana he ki ye pichley saal bhi dilli aae the
 The farmers of Tamil Nadu were told the plight but nobody cared
 ve zarur dilli main pradarshan kar rahe hai magar tamilnadu kii raajnneetik gatividhiyon ko dekhakar nahin lagata ki vahaan ke vidhayakon yaa sarkaar ko kisaanon kii chintaa he
 Now the 23rd day had arrived
 inkaa pradarshan kuch or rup le chukaa tha
 On the 24th, these farmers covered themselves with cloth
 25 wein din ek aadmi pradhanmantri ban gaya or kisaan apni hatheli katkar khun unke charnon main arpit karne laga
 Hunger strike on 26th day
 27 wein din gale main faansee daalkar pradarshan karne lage
 His performance on the 28th and 29th was shocking
 kisi ne kalpana nahin kii thi ki pradhanmantri karyaalay main apana gyaapan dekar lautate vakt ye nirvastr ho jaaenge or pradarshan karne lagenge
 As the days passed the stubbornness of these farmers increased
 chalis hazaar karod kii madad raashi kii maang he inaki
 It is difficult for any government
 centre sarkaar ne bhi 2000 karod se adhik kii madad kaa elaan to kiya hi he magar chalis hazaar karod vah de sakegi, ham andaaza to kar hi sakate hai
 What he did on the 29th was even more difficult
 khuli sadak par chaaval ko chadar kii tarah bicha diya
 Put dal on it and started eating
 aap or ham kabhi is tarah se nahin kha sakate, kisi duusare ko khate dekh bhi nahin sakate
 On the 30th day, he wrote a demand on the chest and back of the body he had changed into language
 blike board ban gaye
 We do not have information on the 31st day
 32 wein din in kisaanon ne sari pahanakar pradarshan kiya
 Keep in mind - dead bodies were made, nude, mustache turned and now started wearing saris
 in kisaanon ne bataaya ki ek kisaan ne patni kaa mangalsutra girvee rakhkar karz liya tha
 If he could not repay the loan, the moneylender took Mangalasutra
 is seen ko kisaanon ne jantar mantar par doharaaya
 Wearing thread threads started to perform
 media report ke anusaar rajya ke sahakaarita bainkon se liye gaye 5,780 karod ke karz vahaan kii sarkaar ne maaf kar die hai
 The High Court has also said that the debt of the farmers of Tamil Nadu should be waived
 is baar tamilnadu main pichley 140 saal main sabase kam barish hui he
 Last year, it received 170 mm of rainfall, while the average rainfall is 437 mm
 kai zile aise hai jahaan 60 fisadi kam barish hui he
 There is a water crisis in many areas of the state
 80 fisadi kisaan, chote kisaan hai
 You may have heard in Tamil Nadu that cheap food is being given
 kisaanon ko sasti daron par anaaj bhi diya jaataa he
 Why farmers are committing suicide even after this
 kyonki karz kaa boj unki seemaa ko paar kar gaya he
 On the 34th day the peasants became women, broke the bangle and began to perform
 37 wein din kisaanon ne fata hua kurta pahan liya
 Became crazy
 ve ab pagal banakar pradarshan karne lage
 The comments aap kah sakate hai ki kisaanon ke in pradarshnon main atvaad he, vicitra bhi hai, lekin yah bhi to dekhie ki aam kisaan apni baat ko lekar kaise lard rahaa he
 What methods are being devised to fight
 jantar mantar par hi unka ghar bas gaya he
 We are not going to leave till the demand is met, so spend the night there, cook there
 aasapaas se log madad bhi karne aa rahe hai
 Someone is giving financial help and some is giving moral help
 lekin inke pradarshnon main koi jor shor se shaamil nahin he
 The leaders have gone to the minister, but the formalities of going have been recorded, they have been filled
 kisaan chakravyuuh main fanse hai
 It is not that governments do nothing but they do not do enough
 kisaanon ne jo rachanaatmakataa dikhaai he usase unki bechaini samaj main aati he
 Some people will also be condemning why so much extremism
 kai baar karunaa dikhaani chahie
 One should try to understand why someone is pressing a mouse in their mouth, eating pulses and rice on the ground
 wo kya kahana chahta he, kya paanaa chahta he
 Farmers need similar stubbornness and creativity to overcome their problems
 pradarshan ke liye bhi or kheti ke taur tareeke badal dene ke liye bhi
 
 
 
 aisa hi jor lagaana hoga mahangi kheti ke chakra se nikalne ke liye
 
 
 If the leaders want in a minute, then the rigging of private schools can be stopped
 ve chahen to sarkari skool bhi sudhar sakate hai magar sabko pataa he antim lakshya note bananaa he
 To do as much in the name of work so as to create a headline in the media that the school was visited
 teacher ko hadakaa liya gaya, phir skulon main khaali shikshakon ke hajaaron padon ke sawaal, bench se lekar kitabon ke sawaal kahin kho jate hai
 You will see that our today's politics is doing the same so that images can be generated for uploading in whatsapp or Facebook
 taaki kaam jitna ho nahin, usase kahin zyaada lage ki haa kuch ho rahaa he
 Now several months have passed, with the law claiming to rein in the builders
 iske baad bhi har ravivaar ko noida greater noida main hi flats kareedne waalon kaa pradarshan kyon jari he
 Have you seen any political party leader perform with them in the sun on Sunday? ve nahin dikhenge haa apane ghar main bulaakaar mulaakaat karte hue zarur dikhenge jisaki tasviir media main pradarshan karne vaale logon se kahin zyaada chhapati he
 After all, how does a leader become a hero or a public leader in the struggle created by the people
 use to aap hi banaate hai
 Yet this series of demonstrations against powerful builders does not raise hopes that one can snatch democracy no matter how much power it acquires
 ye koun log hai jo bilderon se loha le rahe hai ,sochiega kabhi inke bare main
 Schools and real estate are strongholds where leaders are killed
 iske zarie logon kaa hausala post kiya gaya
 Even after their earnings are being grabbed, only a small number of people are right but there are some people who are raising their voice
 in logon ko dekhte hue ummiido se labalab ho janaa chahie
 Taking time away from the cow and the temple, think about where the leader is when there is a public issue
 aisa nahin ki netaa ke mudde janata ke nahin hote, bas netaaon ke muddon ko janata tay nahin karti he
 They have their own way
 kisaan paidal march karenge to do tasviir nahin chhapegi, tivi par do minute footage nahin dikhegaa, magar kisaanon ko lekar bade raajnneetik dal ke netaa padayatra karenge to uskaa ghanton sidhaa prasaaran kiya jayega or vaahvahee hogi ki kisaanon kii takalif samajhane vaala netaa aa gaya he
 It is all sustained by your blessings
 ise kisi bahari ne nahin balki aapane banaaya he
 There is a picture, of March 2015, from Jharkhand
 ek kagaz par log pakhaana kar rahe hai, tatti kar rahe hai
 In English these days it is called washroom because the toilet or latrine now sounds as ugly as a toilet or a pakhana
 yah tasviir he naksal prabhavit latehar ke barbadih blaak aphis kii jahaan saath gaanv ke log jamaa hue the
 So what are you doing while plucking it on paper
 do saal pehle is tarkeeb se in kisaanon ne bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon kaa virodh kiya tha
 Their goal was to shock our habit of watching and not watching the performances
 hamaare sahyogi alok pandey ne tab likhaa tha ki yah idia kisi piaar yaa event management company kii taraf se nahin aayaa tha balki adivasee samaaj ke netao kii moulik soch thi
 They wanted to tell how bad the land acquisition law is

 tamilnadu main bhayankar sookhaa he, 140 saal main aisa sookhaa kisi ne nahin dekha, magar vahaan ke netaa satta kaa khel khel rahe hai
 The farmers came to Delhi seeking compensation and loan waiver
 hamane 17 march ko prime time kiya tha ki kis tarah hindi bhashi pradesh main aakar in kisaanon ne apni deh ko hi bhashaa main badal diya
 Hardly anyone who speaks Hindi among them
 vaise hindi bol pate tab bhi koi guarantee nahin he ki media or sarkaar sunati hi
 Leave this aspect now, see how these farmers have given their performance a new height every day
 ye pradarshnon kii rachanaatmakataa kaa daur he
 He is not a farmer, he is a real poet
 jab ye stesan par utre the tabaki ek tasviir he
 As soon as she got down from the station, she did a small gathering there
 sabko nirdesh diya ki kahaan janaa he kya karnaa he or phir jantar mantar ke liye chal die
 In a city where they had to compete with the media whose priorities are fixed for other reasons
 jaldi hi ye log har din khud hi ghatana banane lage
 First of all, he himself was half-hearted
 haath main katoraa liya or us par begar likh diya
 With a half-covered body, these farmers started demanding loan waiver
 inke gale main narmund kii maala bhi thi
 They said that this skull belonged to those farmers who committed suicide by getting fed up with debt
 40 din se ye jantar mantar par pradarshan kar rahe hai
 134 farmers came, many of whom fell back after falling ill, but from there a new batch of hundred farmers is coming to Delhi soon
 hamane sochaa ki kyon na inke pradarshnon kii ek suchi banaate hai
 Let us see what they do as the days go by
 apni ladaai ko praasangik or rochak banaae rakhana bhi mul sangharsh se zyaada bada sangharsh he
 Among these farmers, there is also a young man of 25 years and an old farmer of 75 years
 hamane 17 march ke prime time main inke pradarshan ko shaamil kiya tha
 The next day two farmers climbed the tree and tried to hang it, but the police stopped the incident in time
 tisare din inkaa pradarshan kuch or ho gaya
 The peasants took off their clothes and covered the body with leaves
 chauthe din puure sharir ko paint kar liya
 On the sixth day, he started performing a garland of Rudraksha
 saatven, aathven or naunve din inhone kuch alag nahin kiya
 Jantar continued to perform at Mantar
 10 wein din supreme court tak langot main padayatra kii, 11 wein din jantar mantar par kutta ban gaye or bhaunkkar pradarshan karne lage
 On the 12th day, a farmer became a corpse, the peasants sat around the corpse and started ringing, crying, and also took out the funeral procession of the corpse made of the corpse
 13 wein din ro-rokar pradarshan karne lage
 Went to 14th Delhi railway station and took rats from there
 aap kalpana kiijie, patariyon par daudte chuhon ko pakadana or unhen lekar aana or phir daant se dabaanaa
 What would have been easier? Would it have been just his theatricality? There are other ways to be dramatic, why would anyone catch a mouse? On the 15th day he did a play
 tamaam mantriyon ke daftar bhi gaye, tamilnadu se modi sarkaar main mantri bhi aae, rahul gandhi bhi gaye or bahut se saamaanya log bhi gaye
 But more than coming, they are more interested in getting their point heard
 inkaa kahana he ki kuch ho jaae, dilli se ladaai jitkar jaaenge
 They say that if the government will sit in the train, then they will pull the chain, but even then they will not get off, then they will jump from the moving train
 ab to in kisaanon kaa kahana he ki ve peshaab pine ja rahe hai
 Not only this, he also played a play on Jantar Mantar
 isamen pradhanmantri ko chaabuk maarthe hue dikhaaya gaya or kisaan gandhi kaa mukhauta pahanakar zamin par kodaa khate rahe or madad maangate rahe
 It was the 15th day of his performance
 ham kah sakate hai ki inkaa pradarshan vicitra hota ja rahaa he
 But when did we all imagine the performance in this way
 lekin ek baat yaad rakhiegaa
 Event managers sitting at a contract for lakhs of leaders will create their own ideas
 ab ve kisi sarkaar yaa raajnneetik dal ke khilaaf pradarshan karenge to isi tarah rose-rose idia nikaalenge
 We will do strange things and turn them into events
 abhi aapako lag rahaa he ki inke pradarshan par kisi kaa dhyaan nahin he, magar jaldi hi koi inke pradarshan se nayaa idia nikaalane vaala he
 Ate snake meat on 16th day
 tamilnadu se saanp laayaa gaya tha
 Covered the head and eyes with a black cloth on the 17th day
 18 wein din katoraa lekar bhikhaari ban gaye
 On the 19th day, shaved half the head and half the mustache
 21 wein din puri moonch saaf kar di or 22 wein din kisaanon ke sar ke bal khadey ho gaye
 The movement is led by a 70-year-old lawyer
 inkaa kahana he ki ye pichley saal bhi dilli aae the
 The farmers of Tamil Nadu were told the plight but nobody cared
 ve zarur dilli main pradarshan kar rahe hai magar tamilnadu kii raajnneetik gatividhiyon ko dekhakar nahin lagata ki vahaan ke vidhayakon yaa sarkaar ko kisaanon kii chintaa he
 Now the 23rd day had arrived
 inkaa pradarshan kuch or rup le chukaa tha
 On the 24th, these farmers covered themselves with cloth
 25 wein din ek aadmi pradhanmantri ban gaya or kisaan apni hatheli katkar khun unke charnon main arpit karne laga
 Hunger strike on 26th day
 27 wein din gale main faansee daalkar pradarshan karne lage
 His performance on the 28th and 29th was shocking
 kisi ne kalpana nahin kii thi ki pradhanmantri karyaalay main apana gyaapan dekar lautate vakt ye nirvastr ho jaaenge or pradarshan karne lagenge
 As the days passed the stubbornness of these farmers increased
 chalis hazaar karod kii madad raashi kii maang he inaki
 It is difficult for any government
 centre sarkaar ne bhi 2000 karod se adhik kii madad kaa elaan to kiya hi he magar chalis hazaar karod vah de sakegi, ham andaaza to kar hi sakate hai
 What he did on the 29th was even more difficult
 khuli sadak par chaaval ko chadar kii tarah bicha diya
 Put dal on it and started eating
 aap or ham kabhi is tarah se nahin kha sakate, kisi duusare ko khate dekh bhi nahin sakate
 On the 30th day, he wrote a demand on the chest and back of the body he had changed into language
 blike board ban gaye
 We do not have information on the 31st day
 32 wein din in kisaanon ne sari pahanakar pradarshan kiya
 Keep in mind - dead bodies were made, nude, mustache turned and now started wearing saris
 in kisaanon ne bataaya ki ek kisaan ne patni kaa mangalsutra girvee rakhkar karz liya tha
 If he could not repay the loan, the moneylender took Mangalasutra
 is seen ko kisaanon ne jantar mantar par doharaaya
 Wearing thread threads started to perform
 media report ke anusaar rajya ke sahakaarita bainkon se liye gaye 5,780 karod ke karz vahaan kii sarkaar ne maaf kar die hai
 The High Court has also said that the debt of the farmers of Tamil Nadu should be waived
 is baar tamilnadu main pichley 140 saal main sabase kam barish hui he
 Last year, it received 170 mm of rainfall, while the average rainfall is 437 mm
 kai zile aise hai jahaan 60 fisadi kam barish hui he
 There is a water crisis in many areas of the state
 80 fisadi kisaan, chote kisaan hai
 You may have heard in Tamil Nadu that cheap food is being given
 kisaanon ko sasti daron par anaaj bhi diya jaataa he
 Why farmers are committing suicide even after this
 kyonki karz kaa boj unki seemaa ko paar kar gaya he
 On the 34th day the peasants became women, broke the bangle and began to perform
 37 wein din kisaanon ne fata hua kurta pahan liya
 Became crazy
 ve ab pagal banakar pradarshan karne lage
 The comments aap kah sakate hai ki kisaanon ke in pradarshnon main atvaad he, vicitra bhi hai, lekin yah bhi to dekhie ki aam kisaan apni baat ko lekar kaise lard rahaa he
 What methods are being devised to fight
 jantar mantar par hi unka ghar bas gaya he
 We are not going to leave till the demand is met, so spend the night there, cook there
 aasapaas se log madad bhi karne aa rahe hai
 Someone is giving financial help and some is giving moral help
 lekin inke pradarshnon main koi jor shor se shaamil nahin he
 The leaders have gone to the minister, but the formalities of going have been recorded, they have been filled
 kisaan chakravyuuh main fanse hai
 It is not that governments do nothing but they do not do enough
 kisaanon ne jo rachanaatmakataa dikhaai he usase unki bechaini samaj main aati he
 Some people will also be condemning why so much extremism
 kai baar karunaa dikhaani chahie
 One should try to understand why someone is pressing a mouse in their mouth, eating pulses and rice on the ground
 wo kya kahana chahta he, kya paanaa chahta he
 Farmers need similar stubbornness and creativity to overcome their problems
 pradarshan ke liye bhi or kheti ke taur tareeke badal dene ke liye bhi
 
 
 
 aisa hi jor lagaana hoga mahangi kheti ke chakra se nikalne ke liye
 
 
 Schools and real estate are strongholds where leaders are killed
 iske zarie logon kaa hausala post kiya gaya
 Even after their earnings are being grabbed, only a small number of people are right but there are some people who are raising their voice
 in logon ko dekhte hue ummiido se labalab ho janaa chahie
 Taking time away from the cow and the temple, think about where the leader is when there is a public issue
 aisa nahin ki netaa ke mudde janata ke nahin hote, bas netaaon ke muddon ko janata tay nahin karti he
 They have their own way
 kisaan paidal march karenge to do tasviir nahin chhapegi, tivi par do minute footage nahin dikhegaa, magar kisaanon ko lekar bade raajnneetik dal ke netaa padayatra karenge to uskaa ghanton sidhaa prasaaran kiya jayega or vaahvahee hogi ki kisaanon kii takalif samajhane vaala netaa aa gaya he
 It is all sustained by your blessings
 ise kisi bahari ne nahin balki aapane banaaya he
 There is a picture, of March 2015, from Jharkhand
 ek kagaz par log pakhaana kar rahe hai, tatti kar rahe hai
 In English these days it is called washroom because the toilet or latrine now sounds as ugly as a toilet or a pakhana
 yah tasviir he naksal prabhavit latehar ke barbadih blaak aphis kii jahaan saath gaanv ke log jamaa hue the
 So what are you doing while plucking it on paper
 do saal pehle is tarkeeb se in kisaanon ne bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon kaa virodh kiya tha
 Their goal was to shock our habit of watching and not watching the performances
 hamaare sahyogi alok pandey ne tab likhaa tha ki yah idia kisi piaar yaa event management company kii taraf se nahin aayaa tha balki adivasee samaaj ke netao kii moulik soch thi
 They wanted to tell how bad the land acquisition law is
 aam logon ke pradarshnon or netaaon ke aayojanon main kitni rachanaatmakataa aa gai he
 Although there is a big difference in the creativity of both, there is a difference in the morality of both, but change has already taken place
 pehle padayatra hua karti thi, phir wo rathyatra hui, phir wo road sho hua or ab road sho bhi badal gaya he
 Thousands of bikes range from laser lights
 sab kuch is tarah se hone laga he jaise raajnneeti mumbai ke mehboob studio main filmai ja rahi he
 Switzerland is there, England is there
 netaaon ke pradarshan ab tivi par prasaaran ke hisaab se hote hai
 His camera has changed to the angle so that you have a deep impact on your mind
 garibi dur karne vaale or garibi jhelkar manch par pahunche netaaon ke kapade tak diziner hai, mahange hai
 You also like all this
 lekin gaur se dekhie aapke tivi screen par aane ke liye netaa yaa aayojan main kitni teji se badlaav aa rahe hai
 a few years ago when Satyagraha was going on day and night in Ramlila Maidan, some farmers got down to perform water satyagraha in Narmada River
 213 logon ne 32 dinon tak qamar bhar pani main khadey hokar pradarshan kiya tha
 His legs were damaged
 media or sarkaar kaa dhyaan aakarshith karne ke liye aam logon ko kya-kya karnaa pad rahaa he
 He continued to enrich this democracy through his creativity
 kabhi jeet jate hai, kabhi haar bhi jate hai
 On 14 March, 134 farmers from Tamil Nadu arrived in Delhi
 tamilnadu main bhayankar sookhaa he, 140 saal main aisa sookhaa kisi ne nahin dekha, magar vahaan ke netaa satta kaa khel khel rahe hai

 18 wein din katoraa lekar bhikhaari ban gaye
 On the 19th day, shaved half the head and half the mustache
 21 wein din puri moonch saaf kar di or 22 wein din kisaanon ke sar ke bal khadey ho gaye
 The movement is led by a 70-year-old lawyer
 inkaa kahana he ki ye pichley saal bhi dilli aae the
 The farmers of Tamil Nadu were told the plight but nobody cared
 ve zarur dilli main pradarshan kar rahe hai magar tamilnadu kii raajnneetik gatividhiyon ko dekhakar nahin lagata ki vahaan ke vidhayakon yaa sarkaar ko kisaanon kii chintaa he
 Now the 23rd day had arrived
 inkaa pradarshan kuch or rup le chukaa tha
 On the 24th, these farmers covered themselves with cloth
 25 wein din ek aadmi pradhanmantri ban gaya or kisaan apni hatheli katkar khun unke charnon main arpit karne laga
 Hunger strike on 26th day
 27 wein din gale main faansee daalkar pradarshan karne lage
 His performance on the 28th and 29th was shocking
 kisi ne kalpana nahin kii thi ki pradhanmantri karyaalay main apana gyaapan dekar lautate vakt ye nirvastr ho jaaenge or pradarshan karne lagenge
 As the days passed the stubbornness of these farmers increased
 chalis hazaar karod kii madad raashi kii maang he inaki
 It is difficult for any government
 centre sarkaar ne bhi 2000 karod se adhik kii madad kaa elaan to kiya hi he magar chalis hazaar karod vah de sakegi, ham andaaza to kar hi sakate hai
 What he did on the 29th was even more difficult
 khuli sadak par chaaval ko chadar kii tarah bicha diya
 Put dal on it and started eating
 aap or ham kabhi is tarah se nahin kha sakate, kisi duusare ko khate dekh bhi nahin sakate
 On the 30th day, he wrote a demand on the chest and back of the body he had changed into language
 blike board ban gaye
 We do not have information on the 31st day
 32 wein din in kisaanon ne sari pahanakar pradarshan kiya
 Keep in mind - dead bodies were made, nude, mustache turned and now started wearing saris
 in kisaanon ne bataaya ki ek kisaan ne patni kaa mangalsutra girvee rakhkar karz liya tha
 If he could not repay the loan, the moneylender took Mangalasutra
 is seen ko kisaanon ne jantar mantar par doharaaya
 Wearing thread threads started to perform
 media report ke anusaar rajya ke sahakaarita bainkon se liye gaye 5,780 karod ke karz vahaan kii sarkaar ne maaf kar die hai
 The High Court has also said that the debt of the farmers of Tamil Nadu should be waived
 is baar tamilnadu main pichley 140 saal main sabase kam barish hui he
 Last year, it received 170 mm of rainfall, while the average rainfall is 437 mm
 kai zile aise hai jahaan 60 fisadi kam barish hui he
 There is a water crisis in many areas of the state
 80 fisadi kisaan, chote kisaan hai
 You may have heard in Tamil Nadu that cheap food is being given
 kisaanon ko sasti daron par anaaj bhi diya jaataa he
 Why farmers are committing suicide even after this
 kyonki karz kaa boj unki seemaa ko paar kar gaya he
 On the 34th day the peasants became women, broke the bangle and began to perform
 37 wein din kisaanon ne fata hua kurta pahan liya
 Became crazy
 ve ab pagal banakar pradarshan karne lage
 The comments aap kah sakate hai ki kisaanon ke in pradarshnon main atvaad he, vicitra bhi hai, lekin yah bhi to dekhie ki aam kisaan apni baat ko lekar kaise lard rahaa he
 What methods are being devised to fight
 jantar mantar par hi unka ghar bas gaya he
 We are not going to leave till the demand is met, so spend the night there, cook there
 aasapaas se log madad bhi karne aa rahe hai
 Someone is giving financial help and some is giving moral help
 lekin inke pradarshnon main koi jor shor se shaamil nahin he
 The leaders have gone to the minister, but the formalities of going have been recorded, they have been filled
 kisaan chakravyuuh main fanse hai
 It is not that governments do nothing but they do not do enough
 kisaanon ne jo rachanaatmakataa dikhaai he usase unki bechaini samaj main aati he
 Some people will also be condemning why so much extremism
 kai baar karunaa dikhaani chahie
 One should try to understand why someone is pressing a mouse in their mouth, eating pulses and rice on the ground
 wo kya kahana chahta he, kya paanaa chahta he
 Farmers need similar stubbornness and creativity to overcome their problems
 pradarshan ke liye bhi or kheti ke taur tareeke badal dene ke liye bhi
 
 
 
 aisa hi jor lagaana hoga mahangi kheti ke chakra se nikalne ke liye
 
 
 How much creativity has come in common people's demonstrations and leaders' events
 haalanki donon kii rachanaatmakataa main kaaphi antar he, donon kii naitikta main bhi antar he lekin badlaav to aa hi chukaa he
 Earlier there used to be a padyatra, then that rath yatra, then that roadshow happened and now the roadshow has also changed
 leisure lite se lekar hazaron bikon kaa istamaal hota he
 Everything has started happening as if politics is being filmed at Mehboob Studio in Mumbai
 vahiin par switzaraland he vahiin par england he
 Leaders' performances are now broadcast on TV
 unka camera angel tak badal gaya he taaki aap ke dimag par gaharaa asar ho
 Even the clothes of the poverty alleviators and the leaders who reached the stage with poverty are designers, expensive
 ye sab aapako acha bhi lagata he
 But look at how fast changes are taking place in the leader or organization to come to your TV screen
 kuch saal pehle jab ramlila maidan main din-raat satyagrah chal rahaa tha tab narmada nadi main kuch kisaan jal satyagrah karne utar gaye
 213 people performed for 32 days standing in water across the waist
 unke paanv kharaab ho gaye the
 What are the common people having to do to get the attention of media and government
 ve apni rachanaatmakataa ke zarie is loktantr ko samrudh karte rahe
 Sometimes they win, sometimes they lose
 14 march ko tamilnadu se 134 kisaan dilli aae
 There is a severe drought in Tamil Nadu, no one has seen such a drought in 140 years, but the leaders there are playing the game of power
 kisaan muaavze or karz maafee kii maang ko lekar dilli aae
 We did prime time on March 17, how these farmers, after coming to the Hindi-speaking state, converted their bodies into language
 mushkil se inke bich hindi bolne vaala he
 Even if we could speak Hindi, there is no guarantee that the media and the government would listen
 yah pahalu abhi chhod dijie, dekhie ki in kisaanon ne apane pradarshan ko kis tarah se har din ek nai oonchai di he
 This is a period of creativity in performances
 kisaan nahin ye asli kavi hai
 There is a picture of when they landed at the station
 stesan se utarate hi vahaan choti moti sabha jaisi kar lee
 Instructed everyone where to go and what to do and then left for Jantar Mantar
 ek aise shahar main jahaan inhen us media se bhi hode lenaa tha jisaki praathamiktaayen anya kaarnon se tay hoti rahati hai
 Soon these people started becoming incidents every day
 sabase pehle khud ko ardhangn kiya
 Took a bowl in hand and wrote a bagger on it
 aadhe dhanke tan ke saath ye kisaan karz maafee kii maang karne lage
 There was also a garland of Narmund in his neck
 inkaa kahana tha ki yah khopadi un kisaanon kii he jinhone karz se tang aakar aatmahatya kar lee he
 They have been performing at Jantar Mantar for 40 days
 134 kisaan aae the jinamein se kai biimaar padakar waapas chale gaye magar vahaan se sau kisaanon kaa nayaa jattha jald hi dilli aane vaala he
 We thought why not make a list of their performances
 dekhte hai ki din guzarane ke saath-saath ye kya kya karte hai
 Keeping your fight relevant and interesting is also a bigger struggle than the original
 in kisaanon main 25 saal kaa noujvaan bhi he or 75 saal ke bujurg kisaan bhi
 We included her performance in the prime time of March 17
 duusare din do kisaan ped par chadh gaye or faansee lagane kii koshish kii, lekin police ne samay rahete is ghatana ko roak diya
 On the third day, his performance became something else
 kisaanon ne apane kapade utaar die or patton se sharir ko dhank liya
 Painted the entire body on the fourth day
 chathe din ve rudraksh kii maala pahanakar pradarshan karne lage
 On the seventh, eighth and ninth days, they did not do anything different
 jantar mantar par hi pradarshan karte rahe
 Took a padyatra on the 10th day in langot till the Supreme Court, on the 11th day Jantar became a dog at Mantar and started barking
 12 wein din ek kisaan laash ban gaya, kisaan laash ke aasapaas baithkar ghanta bajaane lage, rone lage,laash bane kisaan kii shavyatra bhi nikaali
 On the 13th day, they started crying
 14 wein dilli railway stesan gaye or vahaan se chuuhe pakadakar le aae
 You imagine, catching and carrying mice running on the tracks and then pressing them with teeth
 yah sab kya aasaan rahaa hoga? kya ye sirf inaki naatakeeyata rahi hogi? naatakeey hone ke to or bhi tareeke hai, koi chuha kyon pakadega? 15 wein din inhone ek naatak kiya
 All ministers' offices were also visited, ministers from Tamil Nadu came in Modi government, Rahul Gandhi also went and many ordinary people also went
 magar aane jane se zyaada inaki dilchaspee apni baat manwaane main he
 They say that if something happens, they will win the battle from Delhi
 inkaa kahana he ki agar sarkaar train main bitha degi to chen khinch denge, phir bhi utarane nahin degi to chalati train se kud jaaenge
 Now these farmers say that they are going to drink urine
 yahi nahin unhone jantar mantar par ek naatak bhi khelaa
 In it, the Prime Minister was shown whipping and the farmers kept whip on the ground wearing Gandhi's mask and asking for help
 yah unke pradarshan kaa 15 waan din tha
 We can say that their performance is becoming bizarre
 lekin is tarah se pradarshan kii kalpana ham sabane kab kii thi
 But remember one thing
 netaaon ke yahaan lakhon kaa theka lekar baithe event manager isse kuch apana idia banaaenge
 Now they will protest against any government or political party, then they will come out with the idea everyday
 vicitra-vicitra harakatein karenge or event main badal denge
 Right now you feel that their performance is unnoticed, but soon someone is going to remove a new idea from their performance
 16 wein din saanp kaa maance khaaya
 The snake was brought from Tamil Nadu
 17 wein din kaale kapade se sar or aankh ko dhank liya
 On the 18th day he became a beggar with a bowl
 19 wein din aadha sar or aadhi moonch mundava lee
 On the 21st day, he cleaned his mustache and on the 22nd, he stood on the head of the farmers
 is andolan kaa netritv 70 saal ke ek vakil kar rahe hai
 They say that they came to Delhi last year too
 tamilnadu ke kisaanon kii vyathaa bataai thi magar kisi ne parvaah nahin kii
 They are definitely protesting in Delhi, but seeing the political activities of Tamil Nadu, they do not think that the legislators or the government there are concerned about the farmers
 ab 23 waan din aa chukaa tha
 Their performance had taken some other form
 24 wein din in kisaanon ne kapade se khud ko dhank liya
 On the 25th day a man became the Prime Minister and the farmer cut his palm and offered blood at his feet
 26 wein din bhukh hadtaal kii
 On the 27th, they began to protest by hanging them in the neck
 28 wein or 29 wein din inkaa pradarshan jhajhakor dene vaala rahaa
 Nobody had imagined that they would go naked and start demonstrating while returning their memorandum to the Prime Minister's Office
 jaise-jaise din gujara in kisaanon kii zid badhati gai
 They are in need of help of forty thousand crores
 kisi bhi sarkaar ke liye mushkil he
 The central government has also announced the help of more than 2000 crores, but it will be able to give forty thousand crores, we can only guess
 29 wein din inhone jo kiya wo or bhi mushkil tha
 Spreaded the rice like a sheet on the open road
 us par daal daalkar khaane lage
 You and we can never eat like this, cannot even see someone else eating
 30 wein din unhone jis sharir ko bhashaa main badla tha, usee kii chaati or peeth par maang likh di
 Blacks became boards
 31 wein din kii jaankaree nahin he hamaare paas
 On the 32nd, these farmers demonstrated wearing saris
 dhyaan rakhie- laash bane, nirvastr hue, moonche muda lee or ab sari pahanakar pradarshan karne lage
 These farmers said that a farmer took a loan by pledging his wife's Mangalsutra
 lone nahin chukaa paaya to sahuukaar mangalsutra le gaya
 The farmers repeated this scene at Jantar Mantar
 dhaage ke mangal sutara pahanakar pradarshan karne lage
 According to the media report, the government of the state has waived debts of Rs 5,780 crore taken from the cooperative banks of the state
 hoicourt ne bhi kaha he ki tamilnadu ke kisaanon kaa karz maaf hona chahie
 This time Tamil Nadu has received the lowest rainfall in the last 140 years
 pichley saal yahaan 170 millimetre barish hui jabaki ausatan 437 millimetre barish hoti he
 There are many districts where there has been 60 percent less rainfall
 rajya ke kai ilaakon main pani kaa sankat he
 80% of the farmers are small farmers
 tamilnadu main aapane suna hoga ki sasta khaanaa diya ja rahaa he
 The farmers are also provided grain at cheaper rates
 iske baad bhi kisaan aatmahatya kyon kar rahe hai
 Because the debt burden has crossed their limit
 34 wein din kisaan aurat ban gaye, chuudi todakar pradarshan karne lage
 On the 37th, the farmers wore tattered kurtas
 pagal ban gaye
 Now they started performing madly
 tippaniyan You can say that there is extremism, bizarre in these demonstrations of farmers, but also see how the common farmer is fighting about his words
 ladane ke liye kin-kin tareekon ko ijad kar rahaa he
 His house is settled at Jantar Mantar
 maang puri hone tak jane vaale nahin hai isliye vahiin raat bitaate hai, vahiin khaanaa banaate hai
 People from around are also coming to help
 koi aarthik madad kar rahaa he to koi naitik madad de rahaa he
 But there is no loud noise in their performances
 netaa mantri gaye hai magar jane kii aupchaarikta darj ho, utane bhar ke liye gaye hai
 The farmers are trapped in the Chakravyuh
 aisa nahin he ki sarkarein kuch nahin karti hai lekin unka karnaa kaaphi nahin he
 The creativity shown by the farmers makes them understand their uneasiness
 kuch log ninda bhi kar rahe honge ki itnaa atvaad kyon
 Many times compassion should be shown
 samajhane kii koshish kerani chahie ki kyon koi munh main chuha dabaa rahaa he, zamin par daal-bhaat bichhaakar kha rahaa he
 What does he want to say, what does he want to get
 aisi hi zid or rachanaatmakataa chahie kisaanon ko apni samasya se nikalne ke liye
 Also for demonstration and to change the way of farming
 
 
 
 The same emphasis would have to be made to get out of the cycle of expensive farming
 
 
 kuch saal pehle jab ramlila maidan main din-raat satyagrah chal rahaa tha tab narmada nadi main kuch kisaan jal satyagrah karne utar gaye

 lekin is tarah se pradarshan kii kalpana ham sabane kab kii thi
 But remember one thing
 netaaon ke yahaan lakhon kaa theka lekar baithe event manager isse kuch apana idia banaaenge
 Now they will protest against any government or political party, then they will come out with the idea everyday
 vicitra-vicitra harakatein karenge or event main badal denge
 Right now you feel that their performance is unnoticed, but soon someone is going to remove a new idea from their performance
 16 wein din saanp kaa maance khaaya
 The snake was brought from Tamil Nadu
 17 wein din kaale kapade se sar or aankh ko dhank liya
 On the 18th day he became a beggar with a bowl
 19 wein din aadha sar or aadhi moonch mundava lee
 On the 21st day, he cleaned his mustache and on the 22nd, he stood on the head of the farmers
 is andolan kaa netritv 70 saal ke ek vakil kar rahe hai
 They say that they came to Delhi last year too
 tamilnadu ke kisaanon kii vyathaa bataai thi magar kisi ne parvaah nahin kii
 They are definitely protesting in Delhi, but seeing the political activities of Tamil Nadu, they do not think that the legislators or the government there are concerned about the farmers
 ab 23 waan din aa chukaa tha
 Their performance had taken some other form
 24 wein din in kisaanon ne kapade se khud ko dhank liya
 On the 25th day a man became the Prime Minister and the farmer cut his palm and offered blood at his feet
 26 wein din bhukh hadtaal kii
 On the 27th, they began to protest by hanging them in the neck
 28 wein or 29 wein din inkaa pradarshan jhajhakor dene vaala rahaa
 Nobody had imagined that they would go naked and start demonstrating while returning their memorandum to the Prime Minister's Office
 jaise-jaise din gujara in kisaanon kii zid badhati gai
 They are in need of help of forty thousand crores
 kisi bhi sarkaar ke liye mushkil he
 The central government has also announced the help of more than 2000 crores, but it will be able to give forty thousand crores, we can only guess
 29 wein din inhone jo kiya wo or bhi mushkil tha
 Spreaded the rice like a sheet on the open road
 us par daal daalkar khaane lage
 You and we can never eat like this, cannot even see someone else eating
 30 wein din unhone jis sharir ko bhashaa main badla tha, usee kii chaati or peeth par maang likh di
 Blacks became boards
 31 wein din kii jaankaree nahin he hamaare paas
 On the 32nd, these farmers demonstrated wearing saris
 dhyaan rakhie- laash bane, nirvastr hue, moonche muda lee or ab sari pahanakar pradarshan karne lage
 These farmers said that a farmer took a loan by pledging his wife's Mangalsutra
 lone nahin chukaa paaya to sahuukaar mangalsutra le gaya
 The farmers repeated this scene at Jantar Mantar
 dhaage ke mangal sutara pahanakar pradarshan karne lage
 According to the media report, the government of the state has waived debts of Rs 5,780 crore taken from the cooperative banks of the state
 hoicourt ne bhi kaha he ki tamilnadu ke kisaanon kaa karz maaf hona chahie
 This time Tamil Nadu has received the lowest rainfall in the last 140 years
 pichley saal yahaan 170 millimetre barish hui jabaki ausatan 437 millimetre barish hoti he
 There are many districts where there has been 60 percent less rainfall
 rajya ke kai ilaakon main pani kaa sankat he
 80% of the farmers are small farmers
 tamilnadu main aapane suna hoga ki sasta khaanaa diya ja rahaa he
 The farmers are also provided grain at cheaper rates
 iske baad bhi kisaan aatmahatya kyon kar rahe hai
 Because the debt burden has crossed their limit
 34 wein din kisaan aurat ban gaye, chuudi todakar pradarshan karne lage
 On the 37th, the farmers wore tattered kurtas
 pagal ban gaye
 Now they started performing madly
 tippaniyan You can say that there is extremism, bizarre in these demonstrations of farmers, but also see how the common farmer is fighting about his words
 ladane ke liye kin-kin tareekon ko ijad kar rahaa he
 His house is settled at Jantar Mantar
 maang puri hone tak jane vaale nahin hai isliye vahiin raat bitaate hai, vahiin khaanaa banaate hai
 People from around are also coming to help
 koi aarthik madad kar rahaa he to koi naitik madad de rahaa he
 But there is no loud noise in their performances
 netaa mantri gaye hai magar jane kii aupchaarikta darj ho, utane bhar ke liye gaye hai
 The farmers are trapped in the Chakravyuh
 aisa nahin he ki sarkarein kuch nahin karti hai lekin unka karnaa kaaphi nahin he
 The creativity shown by the farmers makes them understand their uneasiness
 kuch log ninda bhi kar rahe honge ki itnaa atvaad kyon
 Many times compassion should be shown
 samajhane kii koshish kerani chahie ki kyon koi munh main chuha dabaa rahaa he, zamin par daal-bhaat bichhaakar kha rahaa he
 What does he want to say, what does he want to get
 aisi hi zid or rachanaatmakataa chahie kisaanon ko apni samasya se nikalne ke liye
 Also for demonstration and to change the way of farming
 
 
 
 The same emphasis would have to be made to get out of the cycle of expensive farming
 
 
 jab ye stesan par utre the tabaki ek tasviir he
 As soon as she got down from the station, she did a small gathering there
 sabko nirdesh diya ki kahaan janaa he kya karnaa he or phir jantar mantar ke liye chal die
 In a city where they had to compete with the media whose priorities are fixed for other reasons
 jaldi hi ye log har din khud hi ghatana banane lage
 First of all, he himself was half-hearted
 haath main katoraa liya or us par begar likh diya
 With a half-covered body, these farmers started demanding loan waiver
 inke gale main narmund kii maala bhi thi
 They said that this skull belonged to those farmers who committed suicide by getting fed up with debt
 40 din se ye jantar mantar par pradarshan kar rahe hai
 134 farmers came, many of whom fell back after falling ill, but from there a new batch of hundred farmers is coming to Delhi soon
 hamane sochaa ki kyon na inke pradarshnon kii ek suchi banaate hai
 Let us see what they do as the days go by
 apni ladaai ko praasangik or rochak banaae rakhana bhi mul sangharsh se zyaada bada sangharsh he
 Among these farmers, there is also a young man of 25 years and an old farmer of 75 years
 hamane 17 march ke prime time main inke pradarshan ko shaamil kiya tha
 The next day two farmers climbed the tree and tried to hang it, but the police stopped the incident in time
 tisare din inkaa pradarshan kuch or ho gaya
 The peasants took off their clothes and covered the body with leaves
 chauthe din puure sharir ko paint kar liya
 On the sixth day, he started performing a garland of Rudraksha
 saatven, aathven or naunve din inhone kuch alag nahin kiya
 Jantar continued to perform at Mantar
 10 wein din supreme court tak langot main padayatra kii, 11 wein din jantar mantar par kutta ban gaye or bhaunkkar pradarshan karne lage
 On the 12th day, a farmer became a corpse, the peasants sat around the corpse and started ringing, crying, and also took out the funeral procession of the corpse made of the corpse
 13 wein din ro-rokar pradarshan karne lage
 Went to 14th Delhi railway station and took rats from there
 aap kalpana kiijie, patariyon par daudte chuhon ko pakadana or unhen lekar aana or phir daant se dabaanaa
 What would have been easier? Would it have been just his theatricality? There are other ways to be dramatic, why would anyone catch a mouse? On the 15th day he did a play
 tamaam mantriyon ke daftar bhi gaye, tamilnadu se modi sarkaar main mantri bhi aae, rahul gandhi bhi gaye or bahut se saamaanya log bhi gaye
 But more than coming, they are more interested in getting their point heard
 inkaa kahana he ki kuch ho jaae, dilli se ladaai jitkar jaaenge
 They say that if the government will sit in the train, then they will pull the chain, but even then they will not get off, then they will jump from the moving train
 ab to in kisaanon kaa kahana he ki ve peshaab pine ja rahe hai
 Not only this, he also played a play on Jantar Mantar
 isamen pradhanmantri ko chaabuk maarthe hue dikhaaya gaya or kisaan gandhi kaa mukhauta pahanakar zamin par kodaa khate rahe or madad maangate rahe
 It was the 15th day of his performance
 ham kah sakate hai ki inkaa pradarshan vicitra hota ja rahaa he
 But when did we all imagine the performance in this way
 lekin ek baat yaad rakhiegaa
 Event managers sitting at a contract for lakhs of leaders will create their own ideas
 ab ve kisi sarkaar yaa raajnneetik dal ke khilaaf pradarshan karenge to isi tarah rose-rose idia nikaalenge
 We will do strange things and turn them into events
 abhi aapako lag rahaa he ki inke pradarshan par kisi kaa dhyaan nahin he, magar jaldi hi koi inke pradarshan se nayaa idia nikaalane vaala he
 Ate snake meat on 16th day
 tamilnadu se saanp laayaa gaya tha
 Covered the head and eyes with a black cloth on the 17th day
 18 wein din katoraa lekar bhikhaari ban gaye
 On the 19th day, shaved half the head and half the mustache
 21 wein din puri moonch saaf kar di or 22 wein din kisaanon ke sar ke bal khadey ho gaye
 The movement is led by a 70-year-old lawyer
 inkaa kahana he ki ye pichley saal bhi dilli aae the
 The farmers of Tamil Nadu were told the plight but nobody cared
 ve zarur dilli main pradarshan kar rahe hai magar tamilnadu kii raajnneetik gatividhiyon ko dekhakar nahin lagata ki vahaan ke vidhayakon yaa sarkaar ko kisaanon kii chintaa he
 Now the 23rd day had arrived
 inkaa pradarshan kuch or rup le chukaa tha
 On the 24th, these farmers covered themselves with cloth
 25 wein din ek aadmi pradhanmantri ban gaya or kisaan apni hatheli katkar khun unke charnon main arpit karne laga
 Hunger strike on 26th day
 27 wein din gale main faansee daalkar pradarshan karne lage
 His performance on the 28th and 29th was shocking
 kisi ne kalpana nahin kii thi ki pradhanmantri karyaalay main apana gyaapan dekar lautate vakt ye nirvastr ho jaaenge or pradarshan karne lagenge
 As the days passed the stubbornness of these farmers increased
 chalis hazaar karod kii madad raashi kii maang he inaki
 It is difficult for any government
 centre sarkaar ne bhi 2000 karod se adhik kii madad kaa elaan to kiya hi he magar chalis hazaar karod vah de sakegi, ham andaaza to kar hi sakate hai
 What he did on the 29th was even more difficult
 khuli sadak par chaaval ko chadar kii tarah bicha diya
 Put dal on it and started eating
 aap or ham kabhi is tarah se nahin kha sakate, kisi duusare ko khate dekh bhi nahin sakate
 On the 30th day, he wrote a demand on the chest and back of the body he had changed into language
 blike board ban gaye
 We do not have information on the 31st day
 32 wein din in kisaanon ne sari pahanakar pradarshan kiya
 Keep in mind - dead bodies were made, nude, mustache turned and now started wearing saris
 in kisaanon ne bataaya ki ek kisaan ne patni kaa mangalsutra girvee rakhkar karz liya tha
 If he could not repay the loan, the moneylender took Mangalasutra
 is seen ko kisaanon ne jantar mantar par doharaaya
 Wearing thread threads started to perform
 media report ke anusaar rajya ke sahakaarita bainkon se liye gaye 5,780 karod ke karz vahaan kii sarkaar ne maaf kar die hai
 The High Court has also said that the debt of the farmers of Tamil Nadu should be waived
 is baar tamilnadu main pichley 140 saal main sabase kam barish hui he
 Last year, it received 170 mm of rainfall, while the average rainfall is 437 mm
 kai zile aise hai jahaan 60 fisadi kam barish hui he
 There is a water crisis in many areas of the state
 80 fisadi kisaan, chote kisaan hai
 You may have heard in Tamil Nadu that cheap food is being given
 kisaanon ko sasti daron par anaaj bhi diya jaataa he
 Why farmers are committing suicide even after this
 kyonki karz kaa boj unki seemaa ko paar kar gaya he
 On the 34th day the peasants became women, broke the bangle and began to perform
 37 wein din kisaanon ne fata hua kurta pahan liya
 Became crazy
 ve ab pagal banakar pradarshan karne lage
 The comments aap kah sakate hai ki kisaanon ke in pradarshnon main atvaad he, vicitra bhi hai, lekin yah bhi to dekhie ki aam kisaan apni baat ko lekar kaise lard rahaa he
 What methods are being devised to fight
 jantar mantar par hi unka ghar bas gaya he
 We are not going to leave till the demand is met, so spend the night there, cook there
 aasapaas se log madad bhi karne aa rahe hai
 Someone is giving financial help and some is giving moral help
 lekin inke pradarshnon main koi jor shor se shaamil nahin he
 The leaders have gone to the minister, but the formalities of going have been recorded, they have been filled
 kisaan chakravyuuh main fanse hai
 It is not that governments do nothing but they do not do enough
 kisaanon ne jo rachanaatmakataa dikhaai he usase unki bechaini samaj main aati he
 Some people will also be condemning why so much extremism
 kai baar karunaa dikhaani chahie
 One should try to understand why someone is pressing a mouse in their mouth, eating pulses and rice on the ground
 wo kya kahana chahta he, kya paanaa chahta he
 Farmers need similar stubbornness and creativity to overcome their problems
 pradarshan ke liye bhi or kheti ke taur tareeke badal dene ke liye bhi
 
 
 
 aisa hi jor lagaana hoga mahangi kheti ke chakra se nikalne ke liye
 
 
 They have been performing at Jantar Mantar for 40 days
 134 kisaan aae the jinamein se kai biimaar padakar waapas chale gaye magar vahaan se sau kisaanon kaa nayaa jattha jald hi dilli aane vaala he
 We thought why not make a list of their performances
 dekhte hai ki din guzarane ke saath-saath ye kya kya karte hai
 Keeping your fight relevant and interesting is also a bigger struggle than the original
 in kisaanon main 25 saal kaa noujvaan bhi he or 75 saal ke bujurg kisaan bhi
 We included her performance in the prime time of March 17
 duusare din do kisaan ped par chadh gaye or faansee lagane kii koshish kii, lekin police ne samay rahete is ghatana ko roak diya
 On the third day, his performance became something else
 kisaanon ne apane kapade utaar die or patton se sharir ko dhank liya
 Painted the entire body on the fourth day
 chathe din ve rudraksh kii maala pahanakar pradarshan karne lage
 On the seventh, eighth and ninth days, they did not do anything different
 jantar mantar par hi pradarshan karte rahe
 Took a padyatra on the 10th day in langot till the Supreme Court, on the 11th day Jantar became a dog at Mantar and started barking
 12 wein din ek kisaan laash ban gaya, kisaan laash ke aasapaas baithkar ghanta bajaane lage, rone lage,laash bane kisaan kii shavyatra bhi nikaali
 On the 13th day, they started crying
 14 wein dilli railway stesan gaye or vahaan se chuuhe pakadakar le aae
 You imagine, catching and carrying mice running on the tracks and then pressing them with teeth
 yah sab kya aasaan rahaa hoga? kya ye sirf inaki naatakeeyata rahi hogi? naatakeey hone ke to or bhi tareeke hai, koi chuha kyon pakadega? 15 wein din inhone ek naatak kiya
 All ministers' offices were also visited, ministers from Tamil Nadu came in Modi government, Rahul Gandhi also went and many ordinary people also went
 magar aane jane se zyaada inaki dilchaspee apni baat manwaane main he
 They say that if something happens, they will win the battle from Delhi
 inkaa kahana he ki agar sarkaar train main bitha degi to chen khinch denge, phir bhi utarane nahin degi to chalati train se kud jaaenge
 Now these farmers say that they are going to drink urine
 yahi nahin unhone jantar mantar par ek naatak bhi khelaa
 In it, the Prime Minister was shown whipping and the farmers kept whip on the ground wearing Gandhi's mask and asking for help
 yah unke pradarshan kaa 15 waan din tha
 We can say that their performance is becoming bizarre
 lekin is tarah se pradarshan kii kalpana ham sabane kab kii thi
 But remember one thing
 netaaon ke yahaan lakhon kaa theka lekar baithe event manager isse kuch apana idia banaaenge
 Now they will protest against any government or political party, then they will come out with the idea everyday
 vicitra-vicitra harakatein karenge or event main badal denge
 Right now you feel that their performance is unnoticed, but soon someone is going to remove a new idea from their performance
 16 wein din saanp kaa maance khaaya
 The snake was brought from Tamil Nadu
 17 wein din kaale kapade se sar or aankh ko dhank liya

 19 wein din aadha sar or aadhi moonch mundava lee
 On the 21st day, he cleaned his mustache and on the 22nd, he stood on the head of the farmers
 is andolan kaa netritv 70 saal ke ek vakil kar rahe hai

 On the 27th, they began to protest by hanging them in the neck
 28 wein or 29 wein din inkaa pradarshan jhajhakor dene vaala rahaa
 Nobody had imagined that they would go naked and start demonstrating while returning their memorandum to the Prime Minister's Office
 jaise-jaise din gujara in kisaanon kii zid badhati gai
 They are in need of help of forty thousand crores
 kisi bhi sarkaar ke liye mushkil he
 The central government has also announced the help of more than 2000 crores, but it will be able to give forty thousand crores, we can only guess

 Blacks became boards

 14 wein dilli railway stesan gaye or vahaan se chuuhe pakadakar le aae
 You imagine, catching and carrying mice running on the tracks and then pressing them with teeth
 yah sab kya aasaan rahaa hoga? kya ye sirf inaki naatakeeyata rahi hogi? naatakeey hone ke to or bhi tareeke hai, koi chuha kyon pakadega? 15 wein din inhone ek naatak kiya
 All ministers' offices were also visited, ministers from Tamil Nadu came in Modi government, Rahul Gandhi also went and many ordinary people also went
 magar aane jane se zyaada inaki dilchaspee apni baat manwaane main he
 They say that if something happens, they will win the battle from Delhi
 inkaa kahana he ki agar sarkaar train main bitha degi to chen khinch denge, phir bhi utarane nahin degi to chalati train se kud jaaenge
 Now these farmers say that they are going to drink urine
 yahi nahin unhone jantar mantar par ek naatak bhi khelaa
 In it, the Prime Minister was shown whipping and the farmers kept whip on the ground wearing Gandhi's mask and asking for help
 yah unke pradarshan kaa 15 waan din tha
 We can say that their performance is becoming bizarre
 lekin is tarah se pradarshan kii kalpana ham sabane kab kii thi
 But remember one thing
 netaaon ke yahaan lakhon kaa theka lekar baithe event manager isse kuch apana idia banaaenge
 Now they will protest against any government or political party, then they will come out with the idea everyday
 vicitra-vicitra harakatein karenge or event main badal denge
 Right now you feel that their performance is unnoticed, but soon someone is going to remove a new idea from their performance
 16 wein din saanp kaa maance khaaya
 The snake was brought from Tamil Nadu
 17 wein din kaale kapade se sar or aankh ko dhank liya
 On the 18th day he became a beggar with a bowl
 19 wein din aadha sar or aadhi moonch mundava lee
 On the 21st day, he cleaned his mustache and on the 22nd, he stood on the head of the farmers
 is andolan kaa netritv 70 saal ke ek vakil kar rahe hai
 They say that they came to Delhi last year too
 tamilnadu ke kisaanon kii vyathaa bataai thi magar kisi ne parvaah nahin kii
 They are definitely protesting in Delhi, but seeing the political activities of Tamil Nadu, they do not think that the legislators or the government there are concerned about the farmers
 ab 23 waan din aa chukaa tha
 Their performance had taken some other form
 24 wein din in kisaanon ne kapade se khud ko dhank liya
 On the 25th day a man became the Prime Minister and the farmer cut his palm and offered blood at his feet
 26 wein din bhukh hadtaal kii
 On the 27th, they began to protest by hanging them in the neck
 28 wein or 29 wein din inkaa pradarshan jhajhakor dene vaala rahaa
 Nobody had imagined that they would go naked and start demonstrating while returning their memorandum to the Prime Minister's Office
 jaise-jaise din gujara in kisaanon kii zid badhati gai
 They are in need of help of forty thousand crores
 kisi bhi sarkaar ke liye mushkil he
 The central government has also announced the help of more than 2000 crores, but it will be able to give forty thousand crores, we can only guess
 29 wein din inhone jo kiya wo or bhi mushkil tha
 Spreaded the rice like a sheet on the open road
 us par daal daalkar khaane lage
 You and we can never eat like this, cannot even see someone else eating
 30 wein din unhone jis sharir ko bhashaa main badla tha, usee kii chaati or peeth par maang likh di
 Blacks became boards
 31 wein din kii jaankaree nahin he hamaare paas
 On the 32nd, these farmers demonstrated wearing saris
 dhyaan rakhie- laash bane, nirvastr hue, moonche muda lee or ab sari pahanakar pradarshan karne lage
 These farmers said that a farmer took a loan by pledging his wife's Mangalsutra
 lone nahin chukaa paaya to sahuukaar mangalsutra le gaya
 The farmers repeated this scene at Jantar Mantar
 dhaage ke mangal sutara pahanakar pradarshan karne lage
 According to the media report, the government of the state has waived debts of Rs 5,780 crore taken from the cooperative banks of the state
 hoicourt ne bhi kaha he ki tamilnadu ke kisaanon kaa karz maaf hona chahie
 This time Tamil Nadu has received the lowest rainfall in the last 140 years
 pichley saal yahaan 170 millimetre barish hui jabaki ausatan 437 millimetre barish hoti he
 There are many districts where there has been 60 percent less rainfall
 rajya ke kai ilaakon main pani kaa sankat he
 80% of the farmers are small farmers
 tamilnadu main aapane suna hoga ki sasta khaanaa diya ja rahaa he
 The farmers are also provided grain at cheaper rates
 iske baad bhi kisaan aatmahatya kyon kar rahe hai
 Because the debt burden has crossed their limit
 34 wein din kisaan aurat ban gaye, chuudi todakar pradarshan karne lage
 On the 37th, the farmers wore tattered kurtas
 pagal ban gaye
 Now they started performing madly
 tippaniyan You can say that there is extremism, bizarre in these demonstrations of farmers, but also see how the common farmer is fighting about his words
 ladane ke liye kin-kin tareekon ko ijad kar rahaa he
 His house is settled at Jantar Mantar
 maang puri hone tak jane vaale nahin hai isliye vahiin raat bitaate hai, vahiin khaanaa banaate hai
 People from around are also coming to help
 koi aarthik madad kar rahaa he to koi naitik madad de rahaa he
 But there is no loud noise in their performances
 netaa mantri gaye hai magar jane kii aupchaarikta darj ho, utane bhar ke liye gaye hai
 The farmers are trapped in the Chakravyuh
 aisa nahin he ki sarkarein kuch nahin karti hai lekin unka karnaa kaaphi nahin he
 The creativity shown by the farmers makes them understand their uneasiness
 kuch log ninda bhi kar rahe honge ki itnaa atvaad kyon
 Many times compassion should be shown
 samajhane kii koshish kerani chahie ki kyon koi munh main chuha dabaa rahaa he, zamin par daal-bhaat bichhaakar kha rahaa he
 What does he want to say, what does he want to get
 aisi hi zid or rachanaatmakataa chahie kisaanon ko apni samasya se nikalne ke liye
 Also for demonstration and to change the way of farming
 
 
 
 The same emphasis would have to be made to get out of the cycle of expensive farming
 
 
 tamaam mantriyon ke daftar bhi gaye, tamilnadu se modi sarkaar main mantri bhi aae, rahul gandhi bhi gaye or bahut se saamaanya log bhi gaye
 But more than coming, they are more interested in getting their point heard
 inkaa kahana he ki kuch ho jaae, dilli se ladaai jitkar jaaenge
 They say that if the government will sit in the train, then they will pull the chain, but even then they will not get off, then they will jump from the moving train
 ab to in kisaanon kaa kahana he ki ve peshaab pine ja rahe hai
 Not only this, he also played a play on Jantar Mantar
 isamen pradhanmantri ko chaabuk maarthe hue dikhaaya gaya or kisaan gandhi kaa mukhauta pahanakar zamin par kodaa khate rahe or madad maangate rahe
 It was the 15th day of his performance
 ham kah sakate hai ki inkaa pradarshan vicitra hota ja rahaa he
 But when did we all imagine the performance in this way
 lekin ek baat yaad rakhiegaa
 Event managers sitting at a contract for lakhs of leaders will create their own ideas
 ab ve kisi sarkaar yaa raajnneetik dal ke khilaaf pradarshan karenge to isi tarah rose-rose idia nikaalenge
 We will do strange things and turn them into events
 abhi aapako lag rahaa he ki inke pradarshan par kisi kaa dhyaan nahin he, magar jaldi hi koi inke pradarshan se nayaa idia nikaalane vaala he
 Ate snake meat on 16th day
 tamilnadu se saanp laayaa gaya tha
 Covered the head and eyes with a black cloth on the 17th day
 18 wein din katoraa lekar bhikhaari ban gaye
 On the 19th day, shaved half the head and half the mustache
 21 wein din puri moonch saaf kar di or 22 wein din kisaanon ke sar ke bal khadey ho gaye
 The movement is led by a 70-year-old lawyer
 inkaa kahana he ki ye pichley saal bhi dilli aae the
 The farmers of Tamil Nadu were told the plight but nobody cared
 ve zarur dilli main pradarshan kar rahe hai magar tamilnadu kii raajnneetik gatividhiyon ko dekhakar nahin lagata ki vahaan ke vidhayakon yaa sarkaar ko kisaanon kii chintaa he
 Now the 23rd day had arrived
 inkaa pradarshan kuch or rup le chukaa tha
 On the 24th, these farmers covered themselves with cloth
 25 wein din ek aadmi pradhanmantri ban gaya or kisaan apni hatheli katkar khun unke charnon main arpit karne laga
 Hunger strike on 26th day
 27 wein din gale main faansee daalkar pradarshan karne lage
 His performance on the 28th and 29th was shocking
 kisi ne kalpana nahin kii thi ki pradhanmantri karyaalay main apana gyaapan dekar lautate vakt ye nirvastr ho jaaenge or pradarshan karne lagenge
 As the days passed the stubbornness of these farmers increased
 chalis hazaar karod kii madad raashi kii maang he inaki
 It is difficult for any government
 centre sarkaar ne bhi 2000 karod se adhik kii madad kaa elaan to kiya hi he magar chalis hazaar karod vah de sakegi, ham andaaza to kar hi sakate hai
 What he did on the 29th was even more difficult
 khuli sadak par chaaval ko chadar kii tarah bicha diya
 Put dal on it and started eating
 aap or ham kabhi is tarah se nahin kha sakate, kisi duusare ko khate dekh bhi nahin sakate
 On the 30th day, he wrote a demand on the chest and back of the body he had changed into language
 blike board ban gaye
 We do not have information on the 31st day
 32 wein din in kisaanon ne sari pahanakar pradarshan kiya
 Keep in mind - dead bodies were made, nude, mustache turned and now started wearing saris
 in kisaanon ne bataaya ki ek kisaan ne patni kaa mangalsutra girvee rakhkar karz liya tha
 If he could not repay the loan, the moneylender took Mangalasutra
 is seen ko kisaanon ne jantar mantar par doharaaya
 Wearing thread threads started to perform
 media report ke anusaar rajya ke sahakaarita bainkon se liye gaye 5,780 karod ke karz vahaan kii sarkaar ne maaf kar die hai
 The High Court has also said that the debt of the farmers of Tamil Nadu should be waived
 is baar tamilnadu main pichley 140 saal main sabase kam barish hui he
 Last year, it received 170 mm of rainfall, while the average rainfall is 437 mm
 kai zile aise hai jahaan 60 fisadi kam barish hui he
 There is a water crisis in many areas of the state
 80 fisadi kisaan, chote kisaan hai
 You may have heard in Tamil Nadu that cheap food is being given
 kisaanon ko sasti daron par anaaj bhi diya jaataa he
 Why farmers are committing suicide even after this
 kyonki karz kaa boj unki seemaa ko paar kar gaya he
 On the 34th day the peasants became women, broke the bangle and began to perform
 37 wein din kisaanon ne fata hua kurta pahan liya
 Became crazy
 ve ab pagal banakar pradarshan karne lage
 The comments aap kah sakate hai ki kisaanon ke in pradarshnon main atvaad he, vicitra bhi hai, lekin yah bhi to dekhie ki aam kisaan apni baat ko lekar kaise lard rahaa he
 What methods are being devised to fight
 jantar mantar par hi unka ghar bas gaya he
 We are not going to leave till the demand is met, so spend the night there, cook there
 aasapaas se log madad bhi karne aa rahe hai
 Someone is giving financial help and some is giving moral help
 lekin inke pradarshnon main koi jor shor se shaamil nahin he
 The leaders have gone to the minister, but the formalities of going have been recorded, they have been filled
 kisaan chakravyuuh main fanse hai
 It is not that governments do nothing but they do not do enough
 kisaanon ne jo rachanaatmakataa dikhaai he usase unki bechaini samaj main aati he
 Some people will also be condemning why so much extremism
 kai baar karunaa dikhaani chahie
 One should try to understand why someone is pressing a mouse in their mouth, eating pulses and rice on the ground
 wo kya kahana chahta he, kya paanaa chahta he
 Farmers need similar stubbornness and creativity to overcome their problems
 pradarshan ke liye bhi or kheti ke taur tareeke badal dene ke liye bhi
 
 
 
 aisa hi jor lagaana hoga mahangi kheti ke chakra se nikalne ke liye
 
 
 Not only this, he also played a play on Jantar Mantar

 inputah IANS There are several reasons behind the US invasion of Iraq ten years ago
 ho bhi sakati hai, lekin ye bhi sach he ki vahaan tel na hota to america vahaan nahin jaataa
 And the oil for which America attacked Iraq ten years ago, is now going to go into the hands of Al Qaeda
 aatanki sanghathan iesas ne baghdad ke pehle baiji main mulk kii sabase badi tel rifinary par kabja kiya
 Is this spectacle in Iraq still of this oil? Or is it a shia-sunni clash or is it actually Saudi Arabia and Iran having their regional plans behind this conflict? america phir ek or ladaai apane sar thopanaa nahin chahta, lekin vah iraq ko nazarandaaj bhi nahin kar saktaa
 Amidst all these questions, US Secretary of State John Kerry is trying to find a political solution to a crisis in Iraq
 iraq america ke thope hue yuddh ke baad se apane sabase mushkil daur se guzar rahaa he
 The Prime Minister is Al Maliki Shia, the fundamentalists who stand against him are people from the Wahhabi group of the Sunni community
 al maliki se apil kii ja rahi he ki vah shiya-sunni ke jazbe se upar uthakar ek aisi sarkaar bane jo sabko saath lekar chale
 isis's mission is to establish an Islamic state in Sunni areas of Iraq and Syria
 mosul jo ki iraq kaa doosraa bada shahar he us par iesas kabiz ho chuke hai
 However, the Iraqi army says that they have deliberately retreated from some places
 is bich, kerri ke daure ke baad yah saaf ho rahaa he ki iraq main america kii maujuudagi badhegi
 About 300 US military advisers will arrive in Iraq
 lekin isse zyada khatra uthaane ko obama taiyaar nahin
 Obama's statement has come that Iraqi leaders have to rise above their regional plans and find a solution, otherwise a military solution is difficult
 iraq kii is samasya ke bare main kai theori he
 Former journalist Justin Hagler of The Independent, a British newspaper who wrote a book on the Iraq war, says the Iraq war has always been about oil
 iesas ke ladakon ne bhi sabase pehle mulk kii sabase badi rifinaki par kabja kiya, jaisaa ki americanyon ne kiya tha
 Even when there was a furore in Baghdad in the year 2003, even the Americans had first guaranteed the oil ministry, because oil is the power
 kai jaankaar kehete hai ki america ne iraq par bhale hi kai vajahon se chadhaai kii ho, lekin agar vahaan tel na hota to america vahaan nahin jaataa
 Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia together control the world's largest oil reserve
 iraq main jo ho rahaa he vah saudi arab or iraan ke bich kaa proxi war he
 Sunni terrorism is flourishing on Saudi money
 ISIS and Iran support Iraq's Shia government and Shia fighters

 The southwest monsoon, responsible for 70 per cent of the rain in the country, did not wait this year and knocked off the coasts of Kerala at the southern end 3 days ahead of time
 bhartiya share bazaar par achche monsoon ke anumaan par monsoon aadhaarit companiyon ke shares main jamkar oochaal dekhne ko mil rahi he
 At the same time, when the forecast of the Meteorological Department was correct on May 28, on May 29, the shares of such companies registered an effective boom in the stock market

 Weather-agro-economic information claims that when the general elections are left in less than a year and the monsoon situation is fine in the country, then the ruling party at the center gets the most benefit because a good monsoon reverses the government's favor

 Significantly, in most areas of the country, the dependence of farmers for irrigation is completely on the monsoon
 gauratlab he ki 2015 main saamaanya monsoon ke baad lagaataar do saal kisaanon ko sookhe kii sthiti kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In such a good monsoon is going to bring a good day for the farmers and if the good kharif yield increases the income effectively then the Modi government will reap the benefits in the general elections

 In the last three years, due to the weak monsoon, the Reserve Bank of India has postponed the reduction in interest rates
 rigerv bank kii daleel rahi he ki kamjor monsoon ke chalate desh main mahangaai badhane kii ashanka he
 In such a situation, there is a fear of inflation being uncontrollable due to the cut in interest rates

 The Indian team, however, looked under pressure under the captaincy of Rohit Sharma in the T20 series played against Bangladesh last month
 mejabaan team ko pehali baar bangladesh ke khilaaf tii-20 siries main ek match main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 The return of team India captain Virat Kohli has given the team a stability in the top order
 unke alaava rohit, lokesh rahul or shreyas ayyar bhi aise ballebaaj hai, jo ki kisi bhi gendbaaji akraman ko tahas nahas kar sakate hai
 Especially when the West Indies team lacks experience bowlers
 ballebaaji ke alaava bhartiya team kaa gendbaaji akraman bhi kaaphi ghaatak dikhaai de rahi he
 The return of experienced Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammed Shami has strengthened the pace attack of the hosts
 bhubaneshwar or shami ko deepak chahar or sivam dube se bhi acha saath milegaa, jinhone bangladesh ke khilaaf mili simit overon ke maukey ko achche se bhunaaya he
 If the West Indies team discovers a break from the hosts' fast bowlers, then India also has weapons like Yuzvendra Chahal, Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav to stop the Caribbean players

 westeindies ko haal main lakhanu main afghanistan ke khilaaf bhi 1-2 se siries ganvaani padi he
 The Windies team, headed by Kieron Pollard, was also seen stumbling against Afghanistan's deadly bowling, so the Caribbean batsmen will have to show courage to stay ahead of India's world-class top bowling
 bharat is siries ko agle saal hone vaale tii-20 vishwa cap kii taiyaariyon ke lihaaj se bhi ahm maan rahaa hoga
