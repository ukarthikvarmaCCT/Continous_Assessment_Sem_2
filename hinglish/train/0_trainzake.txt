 Union Minister of State for Home Hansraj Ahir has said in a written reply in Parliament that terrorist organizations in Pakistan are training terrorists to infiltrate and attack India through the sea like 26 / 11
 july, 2018 main sabase pehle 'ajtak' ne aatankiyon ke "samudri jihad" ke plan kaa pardaafash kiya tha
 'aaj Tak' had told in July last year that whenever Pakistan eats mouths in the operation of Indian security forces, it looks for ways to take revenge
 is baar pakistan kii army, paak khufia agency iesai or jaish ke aakaaon ne bharat par phir se 26 / 11 jaisaa hamalaa karne ke liye kaa ek bada plan taiyaar kiya he
 This plan is of "marine Jihad"
 pakistan kii navy ke frogamain yani paak water wing ke commando or special sarvice group (esasji) ke commando milakar jaish e mohammad ke 50 khoonkhaar aatankiyon ko pani ke raste bharat me ghuspaith kar badi vaardaat ko anjaam dene ke liye taiyaar kar rahe hai
 Intelligence agencies have recently decoded the major tricks of this method
 'ajtak' ko khufia sutron ne bataaya he ki paak ye sab baukhalaahat main kar rahaa he
 Sources have informed that behind this nefarious move of Pak, there is a big plan to target Indian Navy and institutions built on the coastal areas
 kya tha paak aatankiyon kaa plan-jaish e mohammad ke "samudri jehad" kaa hua pardaafash
 - Jaish's plan decode to attack India from the "sea Route"
 - jameen par bade hamale karne main naakaam rahaa jaish "samudr tat ke bade shaharon or navy par hamalaa karne ke liye taiyaar kar rahaa he nai brigade
 In Pakistan's Bahawalpur, a large army of terrorists are giving training to the "navy Frog Man" and Special Service Group commandos
 -sutron ke mutabik kareeb 50 "samudri jehadi" aatankiyon ko tairaaki or gotakhori kii training de rahaa he jaish
 According to intelligence sources, this training of jaish-e-mohammed terrorists is being given under the supervision of ISI
 -sutron ke mutabik is baar pakistan kii khufia agency iesai ne bharat par 26 / 11 jaisaa hamalaa karne ke liye jaish ke aatankiyon ko dilava rahaa he samudri raste kii training
 Marine jihad training in Bahawalpur is the head quarter of jaish-e-mohammed in Bahawalpur of Pakistan where training of Marine jihadi militants was given under the supervision of Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI
 khufia sutron ne yah jaankaree di he ki 50 top samudri jehadi ko bhartee karne ke liye moulana masood ajahar or uske bhai abdul rauf ne kareeb 500 aatanki rangaruton kaa pehle chayan kiya tha
 After that brainwashing 50 more hardcore terrorists were given training in swimming and diving
 sutron ne bataaya he ki ye aatanki kai kilometre tak pani ke andar military or navy instolation ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 Sources in the intelligence agency have informed 'aaj Tak' that Indian security agencies have plagued the terrorists on the loc and the international border
 elosi ke launch pad par is samay bhi jaish or duusare aatanki samoohon ke kareeb 300 aatanki suraksha balon kii chaukasee ke chalate bharat main ghuspaith nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Even if someone dares to infiltrate, security forces are piling it up on the border
 yahi vajah he ki jaish ne "ground jehad" ke bajaay khatarnaak samudrijehadaka rasta akhriyaar kiya he
 That is, under the patronage of Pakistan, Jaish terrorists are now trying hard to target the coastal areas of India through water
 ab jaish par lashkar se zyada bharosaasutron ne 'ajtak' ko yah jaankaree di he kiaiesaior vahaan kii sena lashkar e taiyaba se zyada jaish e mohammad ke aatankiyon par bharosa kar rahi he
 The reason for this is that Lashkar is in the eyes of international organizations and America
 jaish par kuch khaas pratibandh abhi nahin he
 This is the reason why he is preparing a group of terrorists of Jaish's "frog Man" Jaish of Pakistan Navy in Bahawalpur, Pakistan to attack India
 aapako bataa den ki 2008 main jab mumbai main lashkar ke aatankiyon ne 26 / 11 hamalaa kiya tha, us vakt paak ne apane frog main commando ke jariye lashkar ke 10 aatankiyon ko train kiya tha
 This was also disclosed by David Coleman Headley in his confession
 ek baar phirapakistaepani gustakhiyaan badhaate hue bharat ke khilaaf apane sabase bharosemand aatanki sanghathan ko funding or aadhunik saaj-o-saamaan dekar samandar ke raste bharat bhejne kii taiyaari main he
 However, Indian security forces have decoded their plans, after which instructions have been given to remain alert in all coastal areas
 notebandi ko lekar desh bhar kii adaalaton main lagaataar daakhil kii ja rahi yachikaaon par philhal supreme court ne roak lagane se inkaar kar diya he

 On the problem of demonetisation of farmers, the court has asked the government what is being done to remove the problem, in response, the government says that steps have been taken for the farmers so that there is no problem in buying seeds
 jamaa hue 6 lakh karod rupacendre sarkaar kii ore se atorni general mukul rohtagi ne court main kaha ki ab halaat pehle se behatar or kaabo main he, bainkon main lagane vaali kataren lagaataar kam ho rahi hai
 So far, 6 lakh crore rupees have been deposited in the banks and the government hopes that up to 10-15 lakh crore rupees will be deposited

 However, it has definitely tried to resolve some issues like compensation and rehabilitation of the previous bill

 As a result, all the projects are hanging
 sarkari bainkon ke aankade bataate hai ki march tak 7 lakh karod ru
 Projects of more than one are pending due to lack of environmental clearance
 inase bhi bada masalaa he visthapiton ke adhikaar kaa
 What is proper compensation and how to be rehabilitated? The old law was made by the British in 1894 and it has flaws
 lekin sawaal yah he ki kya uchit muaavje or paardarshita ke maamle main bhoomi adhigrahan, punaruddhar va punarvaas vidheyak, 2013 se samasya hal ho paaegi?aane vaale samay main infrastracchar se judi pariyojnaon par sabase zyada asar padegaa kyonki tamaam tarah kii manjuuri lene main khaasaa samay lagegaa or nae vidheyak ke praavdhaanon ke mutabik muaavja dene par pariyojna kii laagat bhi bad jaaegi
 According to the new bill, the Social Impact Assessment (SIA) survey will be necessary for the acquisition of land, which will be prepared in consultation with the gram sabha in the case of villages and with such a body in the case of cities

 Along with this, another committee will review the report to see if the proposal for land acquisition meets all the necessary conditions
 buniyadi kshetra se judi company echsisi limited ke chairman ajit gulabchand kehete hai, ''nae vidheyak kaa asar yah hoga ki jameen kharidne vaali companiyon ko mukademon se do-chaar hona padegaa

 ' chunaav ke dauraan dharm ke naam par vot nahin maanga ja saktaa
 The Supreme Court clarified that the religion, caste and language of the candidate and his opponent and agent cannot be used for seeking votes
 supreme court kii 7 jajon kii sanvaidhanik peeth ne 4-3 se ye faisla diya he
 The court gave this decision while hearing several petitions in the Hindutva case
 supreme courtne saaf kiya kii agar koi ummidavaar aisa karata he to ye janpratinidhitiv kanoon (RP Act) ke tahat bhrasht aacharan mana jayega
 This will be under the jurisdiction of Section 123 (3) of the Representation of the People Act
 supreme court ne kaha ki na keval pratyaashee balki uske virdohi ummidavaar ke dharm, bhashaa, samudaay or jati kaa istemaal bhichunaav main votmangane ke liye nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Election is a secular process and the activities of the elected candidate should also be secular

 So Arvind Kejriwal, who described himself as the Chief Minister of the people, became the Chief Minister of Delhi
 70 siton main se 67 siten jeetne kaa matlab he ki philhal to janata ne unhen apana mukhyamantri maan hi liya he, lekin kejariwal kii chunauti bhi yaheen se shuru hoti he
 Now he will be under severe pressure of the expectations of the people and every day, the question will also remain on his face that how will he fulfill these expectations of the people? How will they transform those dreams into reality? That too when he has made not one but 70 promises to the people of Delhi
 10 farvari ko jab chunavi nattejey 'aap' (aam aadmi party) ke paksh main aa rahe the tab aam aadmi party ke daftar main yah naaraa bahut gunj rahaa tha- 'pani ke bill maaf ,bijli ke bill half or congress, bijepi saaf'
 Meanwhile, Kejriwal had said, i am very scared from inside seeing such a victory
 kejariwal ne khulkar to nahin kaha, lekin unhen bhi shaayad is baat kaa ehsaas he ki satta kii raah aasaan nahin he
 Perhaps this is the reason why the promise of this vandalism can be broken by the center, its role was written even before taking oath
 team kejariwal bhaleebhanti is baat ko jaanati he ki dilli kii sava karod janata se kiye vaayadon main se zyaadaatar ko paanch saal main bhi puraa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 That is why in the meeting with the Prime Minister to the Home Minister, the demand for state status has been launched to Delhi, while they also know that it is very difficult for the Center to fulfill this demand, to some extent It is also not in Delhi's interest
 agar rajya kaa darja diya gaya to dilli ko kendra kii ore se milane vaale bajet kaa bada hissaa use nahin milegaa
 It is not just about the budget, and many departments will start facing problems
 masalan agar laal kile kaa hissaa kendra ke jimme aayega to dariyaganj or chandani chowk jaise vyavsaayik kendra ke hisse aa jaayenge to phir dilli ko hone vaale rajasav ke nuksaan kii bharpai koun karegaa? vaise bhi duniya main kahin bhi desh kii rajdhani ko rajya kaa darja nahin diya gaya he
 Its 49-day government 'AAP' sacrificed the name of Jan Lokpal Bill
 tab aam logon ne khulkar naaraazgi dikhaate hue kaha tha ki hamanen muft bijli-pani or suraksha jaise ahm muddon ko lekar kejariwal ko chunaa tha baaki mudde koi khaas myne nahin rakhte hai
 Therefore, this time during election meetings everywhere, Kejriwal said that no matter what happens, five years will not leave the chair
 ab agar paanch saal apane pad par bane rahenge to unhen janata se kiye vaayade to puure karne hi honge
 Except for the leaders of AAP, if you ask most people, then everyone will say the same, it is almost impossible
 agar chand vaayadon ko chhod den to zyaadaatar vaayade ve tab tak puure nahin kar sakate jab tak kendra sarkaar kii hari jhandi nahin mili
 Now it is up to the central government to what extent they cooperate in fulfilling the promises of the elected government of Delhi and make Kejriwal increase his base in Delhi as well as the surrounding states! dhyaan rahen, jab aam aadmi party chunaavon ke dauraan janata ke bich gai thi to yah baat unhone kahin nahin kahi thi ki ve apane vaayade tab tak puure nahin kar sakate jab tak kendra sarkaar sahyog na den, haalanki jab vah apana ghoshnaptr jari kar rahe the to patrakaron ne yah sawaal jarur poocha tha ki aap kaise in vaayadon ko puraa karenge tab ‘team kejariwal’ kaa kahana tha ki ham kendra se sahyog maagenge or agar janata kii pareshaaniyon kii chintaa hogi to vah jarur madad karenge
 However, there are many states like Delhi in front of the center and it has to help everyone without any discrimination
 haryana ne pehle hi saaf kar diya he ki hamaare rajya ke pani par hi dilli nirbhar na rahe yani koi doosraa vikalp bhi khoje
 States like Himachal and Uttarakhand can also say the same for electricity
 agar 49 dinon main aap sarkaar ne dilli ke logon ko bijli kii daron main jo riyaayat di thi uske liye bijli companiyon ko 200 karod rupee kii sabsidi di gayi thi
 If this time the new government of Delhi gives subsidy on electricity and water to the people according to its election manifesto, then it will cost about 1900 crore rupees in a year
 bijli-pani ke alaava free wifai, 500 skool, 20 college, 15 hajaar camere, har bas main ek guard, chaar hajaar doctoron kii bhartee, 15 hajaar paramedics, do lakh public toilets, nayaa power stesan, 8 lakh nai naukari jaise kai vaayade bhi use puure karne hai
 How much will be spent on it is difficult to estimate at the moment
 upar se 'aap' ne yah bhi kah rakhaa he ki vah dilli main waite kii dar desh main sabase kam karengi jabaki dilli kii aamadani kaa sabase bada jariya yahi he
 So where will the money come from? Anyway, the total budget of Delhi is only about 37 thousand crores, which is sufficient to run the normal expenditure
 vaise, agar jitne vaayade kejariwal ne kiye uske aadhe bhi eemaandaaree se puure karen to shaayad dilli kii janata unhen ek baar or mauka de sakati he or shaayad desh ke kuch or rajyon main unka khaataa khul jaae or duusari partiyon ko sudharne kaa mauka
 But if the promises of the manifesto prove to be 'paper', then team Kejriwal should not forget that the people who can blow Modi in the head-eyes only after nine months, may not even give Kejriwal that much time

 desh ke pratishthit vishvavidhyalayon main se ek dilli vishvavidhyalay (diu) main daalila paane ke liye ab sirf 12veen ke number hi kaafii nahin honge balki ek pravesh pariksha bhi hogi
 DU is planning an entrance exam for admission to undergraduate courses from next year
 is saal ke aarambh main vishvavidhyalay kii pravesh samiti kii baithak hui thi or isamen nirnay liya gaya ki vishvavidhyalay online pravesh pariksha yojit karaayega jisase ucch ank nahin praapt karne vaale chaatr bhi dilli vishvavidhyalay main adhyayan kaa mauka paa saken
 "the proposal for online entrance examination was made by the Commerce Department," said an official
 kuch sadasyon kaa kahana tha ki doordaraj ke un chaatro ke liye yah kathin hoga jo computer se acchhee tarah se parichit nahin hai
 The official said that after that it was decided that online entrance examination will be conducted along with offline
 diu prashasan ke is iraade par antim muhar admician cameti ko lagaani he
 Now, do not believe in DU by making 98-99% number
 ab aapako entrens main baithna pad saktaa he
 The attempt was made last year too, but this thinking did not succeed
 ab is saal lagu karwaane kii taiyaari puri he
 Poonam Sethi, Associate Professor at du's 450 Students Hindu College, will not be able to sit in the exam due to low attendance, "we have noticed one thing
 In the last few years, many boards give so many marks to children that they are eligible
" Go
 lekin kai myanon main hamane unka bauddhik str bahut hi kam paaya
 It seems to me that when the entrance comes, such a qualitative shift can come that the child who has a sharp mind and has not been able to get good numbers for some reason can clear the entrance and make a place for himself
 'matlab saafe he- ab 80 fisadi laane waalon ke paas bhi kam se kam ek mauka or hoga ki unhen diu main manachaaha college or manachaaha vishay mil sake
 Of course, those bringing in too many numbers will find themselves in a loss
 sabhi college ko milakar diu main under graduate course main kul 55000 siten hai
 Till now applications are around 3 lakh
 entrens ke baad inamen bhi izaafaa hoga
 At the same time some professors are also against this step
 hindu college ke hi associat professor ratan laal kehete hai, 'entrens lenge to bacchon se paisa bhi lenge
 This entire move is towards privatization
 admician process cimplifoy ho
 Should be cheaper
 hamaare college main bhi nijee company ghusi hui he
 So it is clear that universities are trying to give it in private hands
 'isamen shaq nahin ki is faisale se numberon kii daud shaayad kuch kam ho
 But the danger is that somewhere, even for admission, the new business of coaching does not start
 dilli vishvavidhyalay shikshak sangh (DUTA) ke upaadhyaksh sudhanshu kumaar kehete hai, 'yah faisla kukuramute kii tarah koching centre ko badhaava degaa
 The undeserved burden is being put on the common man
 bachche ko har jagah maan lijie 12veen kaa rigelt he usko entrens ke saath kyon joda jaataa he
 In the 12th, which is the process of exam, 8 papers 10 papers, what is the sanctity of the result that the children put in hard work? 'however, DU has yet to clear the whole picture
 par ye bhi saaf he ki kuch vettege 12veen kii pariksha kaa bhi milegaa or entrens exam main bhi acha karnaa padegaa

 Let us tell you that on the night of 26 January 2017, Shani Dev will enter Nickler, Sagittarius from Scorpio
 jyotish parinaamon ke anusaar shani dev ke raashi badalte hi makar raashi kii sadhesati aarambh ho jaaegi
 Know that the secret of zodiac sign of Shani Dev's zodiac sign will get complete salvation from the half-and-a-half, besides, the last round of Saturn and a half will begin for the Scorpio zodiac
 lekin is parivartan kaa asar anya raashiyon par bhi dekhne ko milegaa
 Aries: You will have the lowest impact of half and half of the Parshani
 aarthik sthiti acchhee rahegi
 Taurus: If your lunar sign is Taurus, then tell that in the year 2017, your moon will be affected by Saturn's bed
 yani ki aane vaale dhai saal tak aapako kai mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 So do not make any big investment in this year
 mithun raashi :saal 2017 shani kii drushti se acha rahegaa, mithun raashi ke jataka is varsh shani sadhesati or dhaiyya se bache rahenge
 Success will come in both job or business
 kark raashi :kark raashi vaale bhi saal 2017 menshani sadhesati or dhaiyyaase dur hi rahenge
 You will get benefit in jobs, you can go abroad due to work field
 par share bazaar main adhik nivesh naa karen
 Leo zodiac sign: If your zodiac sign is lion, then this year you will not have the effect of horoscope and dhaiya
 naukari yaa bijness ke madhyam se videsh ja sakate hai
 Shani Dev will make such a bad Kamakanya Rashi: The natives of this sign will have the effect of Shani's bed, which will result in job changes
 offis main kisi se bahes naa karen, ucch adhikariyon se talmail banaae rakhen
 You can take a big loan to keep your business stable
 tula raashi :tula raashi ke jaatakon ke liye shani dev kaa yah badlaav milajula hoga
 The effect of Shani Sadesati and Dhaiya will not be seen
 agar job karte hai to aapako is varsh pramotion mil saktaa he
 There will be profit in business too, but if you are investing abroad, then there will be more profit
 puure varsh dhan kamaane ke aapako paryaapt maukey milte rahenge
 Scorpio: The effects of Saturn half century will be seen on the natives of this sign
 naukari pesha logon ko saavdhaan rahanaa hoga, offis kaa maahaul or vahaan ke log aapke paksh main nahin honge
 So it makes sense to keep pace with your colleagues at the workplace
 hanumanji kii puja se shant rahete hai shanidev
 
 
 Sagittarius: This year only by keeping control over speech, you will be able to get everyone to work according to their mind
 is varsh share bazaar main nivesh karnaa bhi aapke liye munaafe vaala hoga
 Talking about home and family, the atmosphere will be happy here too
 jeevanasathi ke saath pichley sabhi jhagade khatm ho jaaenge
 Capricorn: As soon as Saturn changes, the Saturn of Capricorn will begin seven and a half
 isliye shani sambandhit sabhi upaay kar lenaa hi samajhadaari hogi
 Saturn will be beneficial for Capricorn in its first phase
 job-vyavsaay donon main laabh hoga
 Aquarius: There will be no effect of Saturn's half-century or dhaiya this year on the natives of this zodiac
 dhan kaa vibhinn madhyamon se aagaman hoga
 Your financial situation will be much better than before
 job evam vyavsaay donon hi aapke hit main honge
 Pisces: Changing the position of Saturn is not beneficial for you, but will also not harm
 job karte hai to kaarysthal par keval talmail bithaana hi aapako phaayde de degaa
 This time is hard for students
 aarthik sthiti sahi rahegi, lekin ghar ke navinikaran par aap adhik kharchaa karne vaale hai

 He was none other than Karan Johar
 karan ne apana best tri kiya tha ki mujhe aditya apni film main na len lekin aisa hua nahin
 And i took it as a challenge that one day Karan will cast me in his film
 salmaan kii film ko manaa karne se dar rahi thimain kuch zyada hi munhfat hum lekin tameez vaali muhanfat hum
 While signing Salman's movie, i was afraid that if i did not like the story, how would i refuse him? lekin story nereon ke baad mujhe apane role main kaaphi dam laga or maine haa kar di
 It was not easy for a woman wrestler to play Kakidar because i do not even seem physically wrestler
 lekin ye bahut hi chaleging kirdaar tha jiske liye maine kaaphi mehnat bhi taaki logon ko ye na lage ki main sirf ek role play kar rahi bas
 Learning any language is a demand for a role
 i am playing a Punjabi in Filauri and in Sultan i played the character of Haryani while i grew up in Bangalore
 vaise sab ko ye lagata he ki main north indian hum wo main hum lekin main rahi hameshaa south main hum
 Im playing a Gujarati role in Imtiaz Ali's upcoming film

 Ranbir has always been my favorite, my all time favorite Ranbir Kapoor because he has done so many films so far
 vahiin ranvir singh abhi bhi sikh rahe hai or unhone utani filmein nahin kii hai jitna kaam ranbir kapur kar chuke hai
 Therefore, both of them cannot be compressed
 log kuch alag dekhnaa chaahate hanaajkal actors par bahut jayada pressure bad rahaa he kyonki unhen kafimulti toskinghona padataa he
 Dance should also come, there should be six pack abs, so to what extent is it justified? is sawaal ke jawaab main anoushka ne kaha ki aisa isliye hota he kyonki aajkal audiens kuch alag or diferent dekhnaa chaahati he
 Because everyone can see and listen to the songs on their HD TV in Jharkhand nowadays
 isliye wo jab film dekhne haul main aate hai to vah kuch alag hat ke dekhnaa chaahate hai
 i am not very social Anushka said that i do not have much energy and therefore i am not very social
 mere zyada dost nahin hai
 i just concentrate on my work and like to stay busy in it
 mujhe rigerv rahanaa pasand hai kyonki main apni feeling share karnaa nahin aata he
 i am very selective and the same thing happens with my film selection
 main bahut zyada comlection main nahin jaati hum
 Doing 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil' is a big thing for me
 Working with Karan Johar is a big thing for me
 karan kii is film kaa topic bahut hi alag or nayaa tha
 Probably because Karan made me a part of this film
 90 main karan kii filmein dekhakar badi hui hon or aaj unki film kaa part bananaa meri life main magic jaisaa he
 i am very happy to work with Karan and i feel lucky that i was a part of his film
 casting couch se darati thiaushka ne kaha ki maine kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki main actress ban sakati hum
 Even after hearing the name of the casting couch, i was afraid that if someone touched me, i would burst it
 main meri family main dur-dur tak koi is field main nahin tha or main hameshaa army kaint main rahi hum
 But i do not know why it always seemed that i was going to be very famous and i used to go to the washroom and give interviews to myself
 ye ek normal baat he ki koi bhi bachapan main actor banane kaa nahin sochataa he
 This is a common thing and i never thought of it, but it was only in Teenage that i came into modeling and at the age of 19 my first film came
 shaadi mere agenda main he lekin kab hogi nahin patarishte ko chalaanaa do logon par depend karata he ki wo apane rishte ko kaise chalaate hai
 Getting married is part of my life and it is also on my agenda but i am not going to get married right now
 main ek jindagi, ek pyaar or ek shaadi main vishwaas rakhti hum or aisa jab bhi hoga ye bahut hi simple tareeke se hoga
 There has been a lot of change in the film industry now, actresses are working after marriage like, Vidya Balan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and even more actresses are also working in pregnancy, Kareena is also shooting in her pregnancy with actresses
 Questions about marriage and pregnancy should end
 bombai vailvet bahut hi progressive film thifilm main bahut zyada kaam kiya gaya tha or is film kyon flop hui iskaa dosha kisi ko nahin diya ja saktaa
 When a film is made, the whole team works on it, so it is not a good thing to blame one person
 kai baar hota he ki aap apni baat logon ko samajha nahin pate hai or yahi is film ke saath hua
 The soldier standing on the border does not matter whether a film is being released or not, it is not a good thing to bend the right issue to another place
 main khud in sab vivaadon main is liye kuch nahin bolti kyonki main ek army person kii beti hum or mere papa army ke us department main the jo fite karti he
 So whenever there is a war and the father's posting was there, the mother was just sitting in front of the TV so that no bad news comes
 main jaanati hum ki border par lard rahe soljar ko is baat se fark nahin padataa ki yahaan koun si film relies ho rahi he yaa nahin
 Therefore, i find it very cheap to associate such issues with any sensible thing

 gujarat cader ke adhikari rakesh asthana ko sarkaar dwaara kaaryakari sibiai chif niyukti kiye jane par vivaad khadaa ho gaya he
 Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge has written a letter to PM Narendra Modi, raising questions about his objection in this regard
 unhone kaha he ki is maamle main chayan maanakon kaa paalan nahin kiya gaya
 The senior Congress leader alleged that in the selection committee to be elected the CBI Chief, the Prime Minister is the Chief Justice of the country and the leader of the largest party of opposition in the Lok Sabha
 is lihaaj se ek junior adhikari ko kaaryakari sibiai chif banane ke liye jaanboojhkar sellection cameti kii meeting ko nahin bulaayaa gaya
 After the retirement of senior officer Anil Sinha, Asthana has been made Acting Chief
 sarkaar ne is masale par kaha he ki is khat ke jawaab main vah apana paksh rakhte hue bataaegi ki aakhir is kyon is cameti kii meeting nahin hui
 It is being said that Rakesh Asthana, a 1984 batch IPS officer, was the first choice for this post of the government but he was a junior in the seniority order and due to this, does not even join the panel for potential candidates
 tippaniyan On the other hand, critics also say that the government did not even need to call a selection committee meeting to appoint Asthana as interim chief, but the move opened the way for Asthana to become CBI chief next year
 aisa isliye kyonki vah tab tak varishthata kram main bhi upar pahunch jaaenge or iske chalate sambhavit ummidavaaron ke panel main shaamil ho sakenge
 In a letter to the Prime Minister, Kharge has also raised the issue of sudden transfer of RK Dutta, the second-most senior officer after Anil Sinha, three days after his retirement
 congress ke is varisht netaa ne aarope lagaaya ki sibiai chif chune jane sambandhi chayan cameti main pradhanmantri, desh ke mukhya nyaayadhish or loksabhaa main vipaksh kii sabase badi party ke netaa hote hai
 In this context, a meeting of the selection committee was not called deliberately to make a junior officer acting CBI chief
 varisht adhikari anil sinha ke ritair hone ke baad asthana ko acting chif banaaya gaya he
 The government has said on this issue that in response to this letter, it will give its stand and explain why this committee did not meet
 kaha ja rahaa he ki 1984 batch ke ipies adhikari rakesh asthana sarkaar kii is post ke liye pehali pasand the lekin vah varishthata kram main junior the or is kaaran sambhavit ummidavaaron ke liye banaae jane vaale panel main bhi shaamil nahin hote

 Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit on Tuesday retracted her statement a few hours after the controversial writer Salman Rushdie was invited to Delhi
 unhone pehle kaha ki prakhyat lekhak kaa dilli main swaagat he or phir chand ghanton baad unhone kaha ki unke swaagat kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta

 ’ rushdi ko jaipur main ek saahitiyik samaaroh main bhaag lenaa tha, lekin kuch muslim sanghathano ne is baat kaa virodh kiya to rushdi ko apni jaipur yatra radd kar deni padi

 Business conditions are not always the same, but entrepreneurship is the art of creating opportunities even in opposite situations, in which India entrepreneurs have no match
 innovations or start ap, hamaari kaarobaari bhashaa main kaaphi der se shaamil hue shabd hai lekin bharat dashakon pehle se deshi start ap kaa centre he
 Startups that are usually made up of private capital and innovators that always keep us awake with new experiments
 india today ke vaarshik ank ke liye hamane is baar un udhyamiyon kaa pataa lagaaya jinhone har tarah se li todi he or apni nai sujh se safalataa ke nae aayam banaae
 These success stories break many myths about Indian entrepreneurship, for example, that Indian manufacturers do not stand up to cheap products made in China
 lekin is visheshank main aise ek nahin kai kaarobaari mil jaaenge jinhone saste aayaat ko bazaar main ghusane nahin diya yaa phir apni innovations kaa str itnaa ooncha or vyapak kar diya ki videshi aaayaaton ke liye use choona mushkil he
 That is why even today Indian manufacturers in many products are the market heads in quality and price
 ek duusari dharna yah he ki bhartiya udhyami, jinka kaam thik chal rahaa ho, apane utpaadon main teji se badlaav karne se hichakate hai

 The hooliganism that started as soon as the Samajwadi Party (SP) government came to power in Uttar Pradesh is not taking the name of freeze even after a year
 har ghatana ke baad mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav keval kathor karrwai kaa aashwaasan dete hai, lekin hakeekat main kuch hota nahin dikh rahaa he
 Akhilesh Yadav, who was sworn in as the youngest Chief Minister in March last year, had a lot of expectations from the people of Uttar Pradesh that he would live up to the trust of the people by changing the traditional punk image of SP, but from the day of swearing in the supporters The cycle of hooliganism continues

 Chief Minister Akhilesh, who went to meet the victim's family, told the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to investigate the entire case and take strict action against the culprits, but the big question is whether Raja Bhaiya will be arrested and the co's family will get justice

 The refusal of Yadav and Mukhtar Ansari to join the party had raised hopes for Akhilesh that he might want to change the Gunda image of SP
 pathak kehete hai ki shaayad isi bharose par logon ne unhen bahumat dekar satta saunpi lekin jis tarah samaajawaadee party netaa or mantri saream gundgardee kar rahe hai or mukhyamantri akhilesh chupchaap tamaasha dekh rahe hai usase aisa lagata he ki chunaav se pehle di
 P
 yadav or mukhtaar ansaari ko unki aapraadhik chhavi nahin, balki kisi or vajah se party main shaamil nahin kiya gaya, lekin iskaa raajnneetik laabh uthaaya gaya
 Experts believe that Akhilesh fails to take action against such leaders due to many centers of power in the SP and the close proximity of the leaders of the party's criminal image
 chaahe vah beete gonda jile main rajyamantri vinod singh urf pandit singh dwaara mukhya chikitsadhikari kaa apharan kar use peetane kaa maamla ho yaa isi jile main pashu taskaron kaa sangrakshan dene main fanse rajyamantri ke si pandey kii ghatana
 Instead of taking action against his leaders and ministers, the Chief Minister instead cast a shadow on the police officers
 lagaataar bad rahi araajakti kii sthiti se akhilesh ko badi ummiido ke saath satta saunpny vaali janata kaa rajya sarkaar se bharosa uthta ja rahaa he
 Former state director general of police SM Nasim says the state government should set a precedent by taking stern action against its leaders who committed hooliganism and criminal elements
 jab tak aisa nahin hoga tab tak aisi ghatnaayen gundgardee par lagaam nahin lagegi
 He said that after every such incident, instead of just felling police officers, the government should encourage the officers
 aaj police adhikari sattarudh dal ke netaaon par karrwai karne se darate hai kyonki unhen bhay rahata he ki isse unke khilaaf hi karrwai ho jaaegi
 There is a need to change this environment

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said on Monday that due to the wrong policies of the Center, there is such a situation of inflation in the country and before giving a statement on this issue, the responsible people at the center should think because the problem increases due to this
 is
 nitish ne kaha ki loktantr main samuhik jimmedaari kaa praavdhaan he jab chizon ke daam bad rahe hai to centre sarkaar ko dekhnaa he or kadam uthaanaa he
 He was asked about the statement made by Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Power on Sunday in which he said that policy decisions on prices are taken collectively on behalf of the Cabinet, including the Prime Minister
 unhone kaha ‘‘ve pavaar sahab kii bahut izzat karte hai, jimmevaar logon ko bolte vakt khyaal rakhana chahie ki vah kya bol rahe hai
 Now it has been said that if the price of milk increases, it will not increase even now
 ’’ nitish ne kaha ki pavaar ke bayaan kaa haalanki bihar main prabhaav nahin padaa kyonki pradesh sarkaar ne manhagaai par najar rakhane ke liye upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ke netritv main mantrimandal kii ek upasmiti bana di he jo saptaah main do-teen baithken kar sthiti par najar rakhe hue he
 He said that the Bihar government has made sugar VAT free and despite the presence of sugar mills in Bihar, it should not have been linked to Maharashtra
 pradesh ke upmukhyamantri ne chini ke maamle main puri jaankaree di he
 Without naming his fierce rival RJD chief Lalu Prasad, the Chief Minister said that there are some people who are cursing the state government by wandering around the state in Bihar over price rise
 unhone lalu ke andolan ko nakli or unpar nakli krantikarita pradarshit karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki ve kehete phir rahe hai ki unka andolan tabatak jari rahegaa jabatak chizon ke daam chah maheene pehle ke str par na ho jaaen
 Nitish said that his movement should have been to bring back the 2004 price
 desh me rajg kii pichhali sarkaar ne jab satta chhodi thi us samay chizon ke jo daam the use waapas lie tab lagegi manhagaai par lagaam

 filmi ‘singhm’kii tarah patna ke city espi shivadeep lande ne ravivaar ko ek kathithbhrasht police afasarko dhar dabocha tha
 But questions are now also being raised on this action and style of his work
 patna ke senior espi jitendra rana ne mana he ki uttar pradesh police ke saath hui yah ghatana khedjanak he
 Rana says the policeman should have been treated with sensitivity
 esaspi ke mutabik abhi tak uttar pradesh police ke inspector par koi aarope nahin he
 Neither has anything been recovered from them and neither arrest has been made
 haalanki esaspi ne kaha ki maamle kii jaanch jari he or ye maamla sahi bhi ho saktaa he yaa phir vyavsaai dwaara jaanch main baadha daalane kii koshish bhi ho sakati he
 The SSP said that the Inspector of UP Police was caught at the Dakbangla intersection of the city and i had sought a report from the City SP
 unki report ai he or uski samiksha ho rahi he
 The businessman accused the inspector of demanding a bribe, but nothing was recovered from the inspector at the time of arrest
 unhone kaha, detail report main hi pataa chalegaa ki aakhir yah puraa maamla kya he or kaise yah camere ke saamne hua
 The SSP said that the entire report will also be sent to the state police headquarters and the UP police for necessary action
 unhone bataaya ki inspector ko giraftaar nahin kiya gaya he
 He has not been charged, nor has any case been filed
 inspector ke paas se koi recovery nahin hui, isliye unhen turant reeha kar diya gaya
 Rana said, i believe that questions are being raised on our police, because the way it happened in front of the camera and happened to a policeman is not right
 hamaara mahakama bhi kanoon se bandhaa he
 He said that government employees and policemen should be treated more sensitively
 yah baat sunne main bhale hi ajeebogareeb lage magar sach he
 If you want to pay a bribe of just Rs 100 at the railway stations of Bihar, you can easily change the platform of any train
 aam bolchaal kii bhashaa main ise plateform phixing kaha ja rahaa he
 The entire matter is related to Muzaffarpur railway station and the entire incident was revealed two days ago when some audio recordings reached the top officials of East Central Railway Zone, between the railway personnel of Muzaffarpur railway station and the vendors on the same platform
 The conversation unfolded
 audio recording main relkarmiyon or vikritaon ke bich jo baatcheet ho rahi he, usamen relkarmi vikreta se puch rahaa he ki mujffarpur railway stesan par jo train aane vaali he, use kis plateform par lagaana he? is audio recording se yah baat saaf hoti he ki mujffarpurrelvestation ke plateform par maujuud vikreta relkarmi ko ghoose dekar apane mutabik train ke plateform badalawa liya karte the, taaki unki bikri bad sake
 The most shocking thing in the audio recording which has been received by the top officials of the railway is that the railway personnel of Muzaffarpur station used to change the platform of the train of choice of the seller with just Rs 100 bribe
 east central railway jone ke mukhya jansampark adhikari rajesh kumaar ne bataaya ki maamle ke saamne aane ke baad railway ne jaanch gathit kar di or praarambhik jaanch main jo baat saamne ai he, vah yah he ki mujffarpur railway stesan par relkarmiyon or vikritaon ke santhganth se train kaa plateform badla jaataa tha
 Preliminary investigations have found three railway workers at Muzaffarpur station guilty and suspended
 audio cliping main is baat kaa bhi khulaasa hua he ki aamtaur par relkarmi or vikreta mahatvapurn trainon ke plateform ko nahin badal pate the, kyonki in trainon kaa plateform pehle se hi fiks hota he
 In such a situation, railwaymen and vendors used to tamper with the platform of Intercity Express and Passenger trains
 railway ne mana he ki is gorakhdhandhe kii vajah se sonpur divijan par trainon kaa parichaalan bhi kai baar baadhit hua he
 The Vigilance team of Railways is currently investigating this entire fraud
 philhal is maamle kaa khulaasa mujffarpur railway stesan ko lekar hua he, magar is baat ko lekar bhi jaanch chal rahi he ki kya yah gorakhdhandha anya railway steshnon par bhi ho rahaa he?is ghatana ke saamne aane ke baad purv madhya railway ke aalaa adhikariyon ne yah faisla liya ki koi bhi stesan master apni marji se kisi train kaa plateform nahin badal paayegaa or aisa karne ke liye use mukhyalay se ijaajat leni hogi
 The station master must also inform the headquarters about why the platform of a train was changed and under what circumstances? somvaar ko hone vaali sarvadaleey baithak main shaamil hone ke liye congress kii shart he ki agar baithak kaa agenda bijepi ke teen netaaon par karrwai ke mudde par hogi tabhi vah isamen shaamil hogi
 This meeting is being called by the government
 congress loksabhaa spikar kii bulaai sarvadaleey baithak main to shaamil hoti rahi he, lekin sarkaar kii taraf se bulaayi gai is tarah kii baithkon se vah kataraati rahi he
 Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha and Congress General Secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad has cleared the Congress position for Monday's meeting
 sarvadaleey baithak somvaar 12 baje hogi
 Earlier, Congress has called a general body meeting of its parliamentary party
 isamen congress ke loksabhaa or rajyasabha ke sabhi saansad hissaa lenge
 Congress President Sonia Gandhi herself will address it
 isamen is baat kii samiksha hogi ki lalitget or vyaapman ko lekar modi sarkaar ko gherne kii congress kii ab tak kii ranneeti kitna kargar sabit hui he or ise kis tarah se aage le jaaya jaae
 Congress MP Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary, who was out of the rest of the Lok Sabha's proceedings that day after waving placards by tabled the speaker last week, told NDTV that what will be our next step will be decided after watching the government's statement
 haalanki unhone ye bhi joda ki is babat somvaar subah jeneral body minting main party apni ranneeti tay karegi
 Meanwhile, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu has said that he does not want to get into allegations and appeals to the Congress to let Parliament run
 venkaiya ne ye bhi doharaaya ki sushamaa swaraj badi netaa hai or unhone koi galat kaam nahin kiya he
 Congress is stopping the country's progress by stopping the Parliament
 sarkaar kii koshish he ki vah vipakshi ekta main daraar khabaron ko hawa dekar congress ko alag-thalag dikhaane kii koshish kare

 Congress MP Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary, who was out of the rest of the Lok Sabha's proceedings that day after waving placards by tabled the speaker last week, told NDTV that what will be our next step will be decided after watching the government's statement
 haalanki unhone ye bhi joda ki is babat somvaar subah jeneral body minting main party apni ranneeti tay karegi
 Meanwhile, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu has said that he does not want to get into allegations and appeals to the Congress to let Parliament run
 venkaiya ne ye bhi doharaaya ki sushamaa swaraj badi netaa hai or unhone koi galat kaam nahin kiya he
 Congress is stopping the country's progress by stopping the Parliament
 sarkaar kii koshish he ki vah vipakshi ekta main daraar khabaron ko hawa dekar congress ko alag-thalag dikhaane kii koshish kare

 However, he also added that in this regard, the party will decide its strategy in general body meeting on Monday morning
 is bich sansadeey kaarymantri venkaiya naidu ne kaha he ki ve aarope pratyarope main nahin padana chaahate or congress se apil karte hai ki wo sansad ko chalane de
 Venkaiah also reiterated that Sushma Swaraj is a big leader and has done no wrong
 sansad ko roak kar congress desh kii tarakkee roak rahi he
 The government's effort is to air the rift in opposition unity and try to isolate the Congress
 jabaki congress andar hi andar ye jaanane ke baad bhi sarkaar se do do haath kar rahi he ki khaastaur par sushamaa swaraj ke istife ke sawaal par kai vipakshi partiyaan pehle din se hi uskaa saath nahin de rahi hai
 Among them, the Samajwadi Party has openly said that it is not a party behind the Congress
 uske apane mudde hai jin par sarkaar se unka virodh he
 Apart from Samajwadi Party, parties like RJD, JDU come with the demand of issuing the ethnic census in the Well of Parliament
 isi tarah tiemasi ke saansad telugana ke liye alag hoicourt jald banane kii maang ke saath, lekin shorgul main sab kuch saaf saaf sunai nahin padataa or muddon kaa placord loksabhaa tivi par dikhaai nahin padataa
 Hence the ruckus of opposition mps is taken in unison, which is not the situation
 congress virodh or gatirodh ko lekar jahaan tak pahunch gai he vahaan se vah khaali haath lautne kaa khatara nahin le sakati
 The government should take some other opposition parties and even if they are silent, the Congress cannot pull back its footsteps
 akhirkaar vah 44 saansadon ke saath hi sahi sabase badi vipakshi party kii bhoomika nibhaane kii zimmedaari bhi apane sir par lekar chal rahi he
 He should leave his protest, because some other opposition parties are doing this, many Congress strategists find it suicidal
 aise main congress ke tane rahane kii puri ummid he
 Half of the monsoon session commenced on July 21, but the impasse in Parliament for 12 days is not breaking
 sattadhari party bijepi kahati he ki sansad ne chalane ke liye congress zimmedaar he, jabaki congress kii line he ki sansad chalaanaa sarkaar kii zimmedaari he or sansad main kaamkaaj sunishchit karne ke liye use vipaksh kii baat sunani chahie
 The comments bijepi kahati he ki sarkaar bahes ko taiyaar he, lekin congress bahes se bhaag rahi he jabaki congress kahati he pehle ection ho tab discshan ho
 That is, Sushma Swaraj, Vasundhara Raje and Shivraj Singh Chauhan will let the Parliament run only after talk of action
 aakraman hi bachaav kaa sabase acha rasta he kii niti par chalati hui bijepi congress ke netaaon, mukhyamantriyon or yahaan tak kii priyanka gandhi or unke pati robert wadra par bhi hamale kar chuki he

 He said that all governmental and other documents in this regard should be summoned to the House as the Sports Minister in his statement misled Parliament in a big way
 unhone kaha ki maakan ke bayaan main suchanaaen kam di gayi or chipaayi zyada gai he
 Jaitley said that the whole country is sad that the entire sporting event has turned into a massive scam and the cost of projects has gone up considerably
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ke bayaan ko dekhakar lagata he ki isamen jimmedaar logon ko bachaaya ja rahaa he
 The Leader of the Opposition said that the statement of the government shows that the organizing committee had all the responsibility for what happened in the event of the Commonwealth Games
 unhone aagaah kiya ki is maamle main centre or dilli sarkaar apni jimmedaari se nahin batch sakate
 The killer of Punjab Governor Salman Taseer was sent to a five-day police custody by an anti-terrorism court in Pakistan, while his supporters in the court premises planted flowers on him

 dressing room main sachin tendulkar kaise the, yah jaananaa ho to aap javagal shrinath or suresh raina ko suniye
 The cricketers, who shared a dressing room with Sachin on different occasions, shared many interesting memories of the master blaster's personality in India Today Group's conclave 'salaam Sachin'
 shweta singh ke saath hui puri baatcheet padhie
 Shreebhai, your first tour was to Australia
 sachin ko kuch baras ho chuke the
 Tell me some experiences during that period? Srinath: i first met Sachin in 1989
 patiala main match tha
 Karnataka vs Mumbai sachin zyada badi pari nahin khel paae
 Kambli had scored higher
 magar unke stroke se fark samaj main aa rahaa tha
 Then we went to Australia
 unka rutaba kaayam hone laga tha
 For me his century during Perth in that tour is very special
 bruce read, maaikel whitney or macdermod ke saamne pes or bouns vaali pich par khelnaa
 When there are cracks on the pitch
 ye behad shandaar tha
 Sachin was just 19 years old and he not only countered and scored this attack
 ham match haar gaye, magar vahi iklauta shaks tha, jisane hamen us match main maan dilaayaa
 When Sachin scored his hundredth century, Suresh Raina, you were at the other end? Suresh Raina: First of all i want to say thank you to Ajit Bhai, who worked so hard with Paji
 mujhe bangladesh match se pehle kii nait practice yaad he
 It seemed that something special was going to happen
 mehnat vah hameshaa hi karte hai or sakaaraatmakataa se bhare rahete hai
 There is also Sachin Prankster, does he have a lot of fun in the dressing room? Srinath: Yes, Sirius mostly stays
 dressing room main uske aate hi vajan aata he
 But he does not laugh quickly
 log jabaran joke sunaate the
 Raina
 unako kishor da ke gane achche lagate the
 He used to listen to her songs like waves before and after batting
 sabko isse acha lagata tha ki yangster ko gargian kii tarah guide karte hai
 The bowlers doing the net practice of Sachin have to work very hard? Srinath: Sachin and Rahul have always set the standard
 mere liye ve aapaki parformens kaa sachcha sandarbh the
 If Rahul sees a mess in the line and length, he will drop the ball, but Sachin punishes him
 main or kumble agar sachin ko net par acchhee bowling karte the, to lagata tha ki ham form main he
 Getting him out on the net was a very valuable moment
 vanade match ke pehle wo sichuation banaata tha
 OK 6 balls, 12 runs to be scored
 is dauraan koi shot fielder ke paas jaataa to sab bolte uske saath, ye to chaukaa he
 i would argue, but it was difficult to win from him
 usne hi apni captaini main mujhe bataur pinch heater bhejnaa shuru kiya
 In 1996, he came and said, Mr
 Tu come at number three
 jo bhi karnaa he kar, maar
 He got a chance to play with him two or three times
 sachin ke bare main sabase khaas baat he ki jis dhang se vah bowler ko read karte hai
 They know the plan of every bowler
 isliye vah khaas hai
 Most of the times he catches the bowler pattern
 main duusare and par khadaa dekhtaa rahata tha
 Then when he went to break, he would say, put the ball, put it forward
 dekhakar daalana
 And 90 percent of the time he was right
 jab unka andaja kabhi galat ho jaataa, to main unki taraf dekhtaa, ye kya karvaa diya
 So he would say in gestures, mind is yours, you do not play
 capatoun test kii baat he
 Venkatesh Prasad was injected
 mujhe bahut over phenkane pade
 i was tired
 jab batting karne gaya
 So the leg was limping
 main baar-baar stump se hat rahaa tha khilne ke dauraan
 Sachin did not like this
 unhone mujhe tokaa
 i honestly confessed
 unhone kaha ki shri ai nid mor from you
 Then in the next test i scored 42-43
 or jab dressing room main gaya, to unki taraf dekha
 Sachin rarely gives supplements
 jenyuin dete hai
 He was very tough as a captain
 raina jab aapane pehla sau banaaya, to sachin shatak banaakar duusare chor par the, kya anubhav tha
 
 
 Raina: i asked Paji what is the wicket, he said it is a good wicket
 maine kaha, dar lag rahaa he, pehla test he
 Paaji said that there is fear of just 15 20 balls
 tuune vanade main acha kiya
 He kept guiding me at every break and i made a century in his debut
 jab ham us din laute to phir agle din phone kiya
 What is the plan for lunch? chal jaipanij khaane chalate hai
 Had never eaten bataate rahe, ki ye soya sos he
 This is wasabi
 phir agle din phone kar poocha abhi tera pet thik he
 How is preparation for special matches? Raina: 200 per cent of his preparations against Pakistan appear
 paaji ne toss ke baad bolaa, sab focus rahenge, hamen semifile khilne ko mila
 He had a one on one meeting with Batsman and Fielder
 yuvi paa ne kaha
 Will do good fielding
 sachin paaji ne kaha, inako thodaa pareshaan karenge
 Gotti Bhai was batting in the final
 koi chaay ke liye uthaa
 So Sachin Paaji said that no one will get up, everyone will sit here
 itane imoshanalee involve rahe the
 So winning the World Cup was a very moving moment
 2003 main bhi ham final tak pahunche, tab kya maahaul tha shri bhai?pehle main 1996 kii baat karuunga, jab ham kolkata main semifinal main srilanka se haare
 4-5 players started crying after the match
 mujhe laga ki main nahin royaa to meraa kamitment kam najar aae
 But then he got quiet for a while
 sachin kii taraf dekha
 He was not crying maine usase kaha ki yaar main nahin ro saktaa
 Sachin said why should we cry
 ham puri dam se khele
 What happened if lost and of da world nahin he ye
 Then go and play
 maine phir kaha, yaar ye thik he
 See i still hold the towel
 par main ro nahin saktaa
 i could not say this
 magar usne saaf saaf kaha or ham apni siton par jam gaye
 Our bowling in the 2003 final was poor
 sachin kii baat karun to chaahe centuri par khel rahaa ho, yaa shuruaati daur main ho
 Peace appears on the face
 unako apana utsaah sanbhaalanaa aata he
 This is a very royal style
 out hue hon yaa centuri banaai ho
 React very moderately
 vah apane hi duniya main rahete the
 Even after the century, you did not find them much loud
 mushkil ye thi ki unki itani centuri ban rahi thim ki vah shaayad khud hi bor ho rahe hon
 You spoke of the 1996 tear
 2011 main sab roe world cap jeetne ke baad?raina: ham sab imotional the
 Sara and Arjun also came for that match
 maahi bhai jab toss kar rahe the, to kuch ishu hua
 Paaji said don't think about the toss and concentrate on the match
 world cap jeetne ke baad paaji ne us super fain sudhir ko bulaayaa
 Photographed with the team
 vah sabakaa respect karte hai
 Come bowling on the net, then tell them
 mujhe air india main khilne kaa mauka mila shuruaati daur main
 Praveen Amre sir introduced me
 ham sabko pehali baar main hi milakar bahut josh mila
 We were very emotional during the World Cup
 unki fitness aaj bhi bahut acchhee he
 The trainer gets tired, but he does not get tired
 vah teble tennis bahut acha khelte hai
 Pools play very well
 titi main sabko haraate hai
 When we young boys came, did some songs, Paaji said, No i am going to bat, Kishore will go
 unhen kishor ke gane bahut pasand the, khaas taur se 'laharon kii tarah'
 Srinath: If he likes a song, he will like everyone
 nahin aayega, to ek baar sunakar bolegaa, haa bahut acha he
 Will listen to you later sachin bataur captain kaise the?shrinath:mujhe aksar sachin se ball maangani padati thi
 i would always ask for a ball before and after lunch
 kahata teen over de de
 Stop if it feels good vah akasar baat maan lete
 When you have to stop, you do not say, just say this much, do not stay for two minutes
 unki khaasiyat gaye thi ki haarana pasand nahin tha
 Many times, they do not understand what they want
 ek baar 30-40 minute kii batting ke baad vah duusari said par gaye
 Then took a new ball or another old ball and started bowling
 kabhi fast, kabhi spin karne lage
 Many times he would bowl ahead of the crease
 magar quality hameshaa hoti, vah at vil ball kar sakate the
 There was so much involvement in the game
 har khun main cricket tha
 In those three hours of net practice, every second was just for cricket
 game se conection itnaa zyada maine kisi kaa nahin dekha
 Initially, he would stand in the slip and shout, asking to put the outswing, Mr
 Do not take it out
 baahar kar na
 i say friend, i do not know the outswinger
 jab ham net par baat karte the
 His plan was to put two balls in, one out
 hamaari bahes hoti thi
 Sometimes we would be very disappointed if we lost
 magar jab bataur captain unki vaapasi hui, to vah badale hue the
 He was acting more patient
 sachin jab ird gird hote the to aap log kya karte the?raina:ham to bas gaanaa badal dete the
 He used to come
 ypad badal lete the
 Then when Paaji used to laugh, we used to talk
 bahut fan karte the
 Michael Jackson used to talk about moves
 unako racing kaa bahut shauk tha
 Used to talk about cars
 bataate the koun se gear main koun sa oil he
 You will not even know and pressure off
 viraat ne gaadi kharidi
 When i bought, after the Delhi Test, i said that let's go there on the racing track of Noida
 shoeb akhtar kaa sawalham team meeting main kehete the ki do over main sachin ko out kar lo, varanaa 50 over padaayega
 When you had a meeting, what did Sachin say about me, where to kill? Raina
 vah sab unke man main rahata tha
 That when Shoaib's brother bowling, i will hit the cut, i will hit the flick
 positive atitude ke saath jate the
 The one above also helped with hard work
 sachin ke sanyas ke vakt par?shrinath:ye sirf or sirf sachin kaa faisla tha or uski timming kaa puraa sammaan kiya janaa chahie
 My worry is what he will do now
 ab vah balle nahin uthayega
 Will not make a century
 function main jayega, camentry kar saktaa he
 But it is not a matter of playing cricket
 jo sens of responsibility he ki janaa he or ran bananaa he
 That emptiness will remain
 use kaise phase karegaa
 There will be emptiness in his life
 main akasar poochta, or kitne din chalegaa tu
 He would speak abhi bhi he mere andar
 My heart does not quit cricket
 phir usne ye faisla liya or mujhe phone kiya
 i was in Chittagong
 maine kaha badhiya ye faisla he
 Raina: We keep talking to them
 blueberi bibiem chal rahaa he
 If you have to take tips, then message
 agar wo biji nahin hai, to do minute main riplai aata he
 He wanted to focus on the test
 kolkata main dekhie, unki vajah se kitne log aae
 Just now he also won the IPL
 ai hope wo aage bhi motivit karenge
 After Virender Sehwag, now Gautam Gambhir has also dropped out of Team India due to a shoulder injury
 gambhir ko 4 se 6 hafte kii aaraam kii salaah di gai he
 Gautam Gambhir was handed the captaincy of the ODI team for the tour of the West Indies
 jaahir he vah vanade siries ke liye caribbian daure par nahin ja paaenge
 NDTV has strong evidence and documents, which makes it clear that these players were injured during the World Cup, despite which they continued to play in the IPL

 The Meteorological Department says that despite giving warnings, the government did not pay any heed
 idhar, rajya sarkaar ne safai dete hue kaha he ki mausam vibhaag kii ore se aisa koi alert nahin mila tha
 "stop the journey, take out the pilgrims


" Such a warning was given 


 and this warning came from the Uttarakhand Meteorological Department, which the government and administration did not pay much heed to
 ye chetavanee 14, 15 or 16 june ko di gai thi, jisamen rajya main baari barish kaa alert diya gaya tha
 The Uttarakhand Meteorological Department had also asked the state government to stop the Char Dham Yatra and to bring the pilgrims to safe places
 yah chetavanee kai jagahon or or kai logon ko bheji gai thi, lekin ise routine chetavanee samaj kar isaki andekhi kii gai
 The comments uttarakhand main beshak ausat se zyada barish hui he, lekin agar mausam vibhaag kii is chetavanee par dhyaan diya jaataa, to is tabaahi se hue nuksaan ko kaaphi kam kiya ja saktaa tha
 Speaking to NDTV, Director of Uttarakhand Meteorological Department Anand Sharma said that since June 14, we were expecting heavy rains and we had informed the state government
 15 june ko hamane phir chetavanee jari kii or behad adhik barish or bhuskhalan kii ashanka jataai thi
 Anand Sharma said, We also said that people should not be allowed to go to the mountains and those who are on the mountains should be taken to safe places
 hamane chaar dham yatra ko bhi chaar dinon ke liye roak dene kii salaah di thi
 On the other hand, Rudraprayag SP Barinderjit Singh said that on receiving information from the Meteorological Department, we had announced the danger


 We had made it clear that those who are capable, go ahead in the journey there

' aisi chetavanee di gai thi


 or yah chetavanee ai thi uttarakhand mausam vibhaag kii ore se, jis par sarkaar or prashasan ne zyada gambhirtha se dhyaan nahin diya
 These warnings were issued on 14, 15 and 16 June, in which heavy rains were alerted in the state
 uttarakhand mausam vibhaag ne rajya sarkaar ko chaar dham yatra ko rokane or tirthayatriyon ko surakshit jagahon par pahunchane kii naseehat bhi di thi
 This warning was sent to many places and many other people, but it was ignored as a routine warning
 tippaniyan Uttarakhand has undoubtedly received more than average rainfall, but if this warning from the Meteorological Department was heeded, the damage from the devastation could have been reduced considerably
 uttarakhand mausam vibhaag ke nideshak anand sharma ne enditivi se baatcheet main kaha ki 14 june se ham baari varsha kii sambhaavna jataa rahe the or hamane rajya sarkaar ko isaki soochna di thi
 On June 15, we again issued a warning and feared excessive rainfall and landslides
 anand sharma ne bataaya, hamane yah bhi kaha tha ki logon ko pahaado par nahin jane diya jaae or jo pahaado par hai, unhen surakshit thikaanon par le jaaya jaae
 We had also suggested stopping the Char Dham Yatra for four days
 vahiin rudraprayag ke espi barinderjeet singh kaa kahana he ki mausam vibhaag se soochna milane par hamane khatre kii ghoshnaa kii thi


 hamane saaf kiya tha ki jo log sakasham hai, vahiin yatra main aage jaaen

 firebrands saansad asaduddin ovaisi ne guuruuvaar ko loksabhaa main teen talaak bill ko lekar hui charchaa kii tulana babari masjid ke giraae jane kii ghatana se kii he
 Asaduddin Owaisi, president of All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen, told India Today that the atmosphere of the Lok Sabha was similar to that of December 6, 1992
 unhone kaha ki ham na hi 6 disambar ko bhul sakate hai or na hi loksabhaa main beete guuruuvaar ke drishy ko bhul paaenge
 On the question of the passage of the triple talaq bill in the Lok Sabha even after strong opposition, Owaisi said, "if a Muslim person leaves his wife thrice saying it is a crime and it should be stopped
" lekin is baat kaa samarthan karne ke liye aisa koi tathy yaa aankada maujuud nahin he jisase yah kaha ja sake ki yah ek saamaajik buraai he jo samaaj ko nuksaan pahunchaati he
 Owaisi, a three-time Lok Sabha MP from Hyderabad, also questioned the three-year jail sentence in the triple talaq bill
 unhone kaha, 'supreme court ne apane faisle main kaha he ki keval teen talaak kehane maatr se shaadi khatm nahin hogi to iske liye teen saal kii jail kii kya aavashyaktaa he? hamaare paas mahilaon ko suraksha pradaan karne ke liye bahut se kanoon hai, jisamen bhartiya dand samhita (ipisi) kii dhara 498 e, gharelu hinsa adhinium 2005 or muslim mahila (talaak par adhikaron kaa sangrakshan) adhinium 1986 ke tahat dhara 20 or 22 shaamil he
 'owaisi opposed the imposition of three years in jail as a punishment in the triple talaq bill, and asked how the wife of a person sent to jail for being called a triple talaq would get an allowance or compensation?' In the amendment to the provisions for abolition and renunciation, which was rejected outright
 unhone kaha, 'bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne apane swaarthon ke liye mere sanshodhan ke suzav ko nakaar diya, jabaki congress yah sabit karnaa chaahati he ki wo bhaajapa kii tulana main adhik hindu samarthak he
 'despite the Supreme Court's decision, Muslim men are leaving their wives three times saying divorce
 jab unase poocha gaya ki aakhir kyon wo teen talaak ke maamalon ko khatm karne vaale bill ke virodh main hai? to unhone kaha, 'ipisi kii dhara 498 e or gharelu hinsa adhinium ke tahat court main darj maamalon main 80 fisadi gaiyr-muslim mahilaayein shaamil hai
 However, he agreed that Muslim women should get education and jobs
 saath hi unhone shikshit mahilaon ke liye saat pratishat aarakshan kii bhi maang kii
 He said that if the government feels that Muslim women should be educated, then they should be given reservation
 'unhone teen talaak bill par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki isaki kya guarantee he ki is vidheyak ke kanoon banane ke baad muslim mahilaon ko nyaay milegaa
 It cannot be eliminated by law
 yah poochne par ki mahilaon kii suraksha or shashaktikaran ke liye agar dahej adhinium, gharelu hinsa adhinium, vishaka guidelins or anya kanoon paarit kiye gaye hai, to muslim personal kanoon kyon nahin badla ja saktaa he?
 In response, he said, 'because under section 25 we have constitutional rights
 'unhon kaha ki sabhi partiyon kii pole khul gai he
 His views on secularism have been exposed
 ovaisine bhi is baat se inkaar kiya ki pradhanmantri narendra modi muslim mahilaon ke samarthak hai
 He said that Modi is afraid of losing the Muslim vote
 beshak anoushka shetty or prabhas apane-apane projects main biji hai, lekin prabhas ke berthde ke liye bhi anoushka vakt naa nikaalen, aisa kaise ho saktaa he!to khabar yahi he ki anoushka ne prabhas ke liye na sirf vakt nikaala balki unhen ek badhiya gift bhi diya
 Now you will wonder what was this gift? According to a news from the website Bollywood Life, Anushka has gifted Prabhas a watch
 ye ek diziner watch he
 It is said that Prabhas is very fond of watches
 'bahubali 2' main bani hai prabhas kii patni, real life main tha afeyamb jab berthde kaa mauka aayaa, to anoushka bhi unki pasand ko nahin bhuulin or ghadi gift kar di

 In the morning, he shared the first look of his upcoming film with the fans as a return gift
 6000 rishte thukraa chuke hai prabhas, 2 maheene baad anoushka shetty se kar sakate hai sagaai!twitor par phens ne bhi unke is luk ko kaaphi pasand kiya he
 Prabhas will be seen opposite Shraddha Kapoor in this film
 vaise film main pehle anoushka shetty ke hi naam kii charchaa thi, lekin aakhir main isamen shraddha kaa naam final kiya gaya
 This will be Shraddha's first South Indian film
 isamen unke saath mandira bedi, nil nitin mukesh, chanki pandey, mahesh manjrekar or jaiki shroff bhi mukhya bhoomika main hai
 The film is to be released in Telugu, Hindi and Tamil in the year 2018
 9 saal kaa he pyaar, kuch asi he prabhas-anoushka ke bich lav chemistry In 2019, Hisar Lok Sabha seat could be an exciting contest
 haryana kii yah ek aisi loksabhaa seat he, jisapar bhartiya janata party ko kabhi jeet nahin mili he
 This time the results can be startling as there is no major alliance in Haryana before the elections

 The city is India's largest producer of galvanized iron, making it also known as the city of steel
 2014 kaa janadeshpure pradesh main modi lahar ke baavjood hisar seat par 2014 main bhartiya janata party kii pakad dhili pad gai thi
 In this seat, Dushyant Chautala of Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) defeated Kuldeep Bishnoi of Haryana Janhit Congress (HJC BL)
 2014 main chunaav main bijepi or (HJC BL) ke bich gathbandhan tha
 According to the alliance, BJP and Kuldeep Bishnoi's party contested 8 seats out of 10 seats
 2014 main chautaala ko kul 4,94,478 vot mili the, jabaki bishnoi ko 4,62,631 vot pade the
 In this way, young Dushyant Chautala won from Hisar Lok Sabha constituency by 31,847 votes
 2014 main INLD ko haryana main hisar or sirsa loksabhaa seat se santosh karnaa padaa tha
 In the absence of what is currently the equation, the INLD has been split
 INLD par ab abhaya chautaala kaa kabja he, to dushyant chautaala se apane pita ajay singh chautaala or bhai digvijay chautaala ke saath milakar jananaayak janata party (JJP) naam se nai party khadi kar di he
 In fact, Dushyant Chautala was expelled from the Lok Dal after a quarrel in Om Prakash Chautal's family, following which he formed the Jananayak Janata Party on 9 December 2018
 pehali baar yah party jind vidhansabha kaa upachunaav ladi
 Social strife - The Chautala family gets the vote of the Jat community at large
 lekin parivaar main dophaad se 2019 main donon ko nuksaan kii sambhaavna he
 In such a situation, the path of BJP and Congress can be easy
 2014 ke chunaav se pehle hisar purv mukhyamantri bhajan laal or unke putr kuldeep bishnoi kaa garh mana jaataa tha
 The constituency of Hisar Lok Sabha consists of 9 assembly constituencies
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav ke mutabik hisar main kul 11,94,689 matadaataaon ne apane matadhikaar kaa prayog kiya tha
 There were 6,53,423 male and 5,41,266 female voters
 2014 main hisar loksabhaa ke andar kul 1202 poling booth banaae gaye the
 BJP has not won the seat of Hisar till date
 1951 se ab tak yahaan par 7 par congress ko kamyaabi mili he, ek tarah se is seat pichley kareeb 3 dashak bhajan laal or devi laal ke parivaar kaa kabja rahaa he
 In the last three decades, only in 2004, Jai Prakash of Congress won from here
 saansad kaa report cardyauva dushyant chautaal sansad main puure kaarykaal ke dauraan sakriy dikhe
 He attended Parliament during the 191 debate
 jabaki wo 17 baar privet member bill lekar aae the
 Chautala's activism in Parliament can be seen from the fact that he asked a total of 582 questions during his 5-year term
 vahiin dushyant ne apane saansad nidhi kosh kaa kareeb 80 fisad fund kaa istemaal kar chuke hai
 In a way, the vicious Chautala's political journey can be called spectacular
 lekin 2014 main inke saamne chunautiyaan kaaphi thim
 For the inexperienced Dushyant Chautala at the age of 26, contesting from Hisar was a tough test
 kyonki saamne modi lahar par savaar gathbandhan ke ummidavaar kuldeep bishnoi the
 In such a situation, it was not easy to defeat Kuldeep
 lekin dushyant ko jeet mili
 Dushyant Chautala was born on 3 April 1988

 People usually think that after a few years of marriage, 'that former thing' ceases, but the story of this couple will make you think
 ye kahani he toshiyuki or unki patni yasuko kii
 He has given his wife a gift that no husband in the world would have given to his wife
 toshiyuki kii patni yasuko dekh nahin saktin
 For years, she has been watching the world from the eyes of her husband
 yasuko ko madhumeh kii samasya thi jo is kadar bad gai kii unki ankhon kii roshni chali gai
 Perhaps someone else would have considered his wife a burden but Toshiyuki took up his responsibility and handled his wife like a child
 toshiyuki deyari kaa kaam karte the
 He tried his best to ensure that his wife did not find anything unusual, but his wife gradually separated herself from the world
 kuch dinon baad unka yahi akelaapan unhen biimaar banane laga or wo depressant kaa shikaar ho gayi
 At the same time, Toshiyuki had a thought in his mind
 unhone ek aisagarden taiyaar karne kaa faisla kiyajise dekhne log dur-dur se aaen
 The thinking behind doing this was very special
 toshiyuki chaahate the ki ye bagichaa itnaa khubasurat ho ki log ise dur-dur se dekhne aaen or unki patni se milen
 So that their loneliness will disappear
 velentine de par log ek duusare ko phulon ke guladaste dete hai lekin is pati ke pyaar ko aap kya kahenge jisane apni patni ke liye puraa garden hi taiyaar kar diya
 Toshiyuki and Yasuko, who live in Japan, have been married for 60 years
 shaadi ke kuch dinon baad hi unki jindagi main ek tufaan aayaa or yasuko kii ankhon kii roshni chali gai
 Toshiyuki owned 60 cattle at the time and his work was being affected due to his wife's condition
 yasuko na to kisi se milti thim or na hi apane kamare se baahar aati thim
 Then Toshiyuki's mind came up to prepare the garden
 apni is yojana ko saakaar rup dene ke liye unhone apana deyari kaa kaam chhod diya or garden taiyaar karne ke kaam main jute gaye
 They have planted thousands of pink flowers of Shibazakura around their house
 is garden ko taiyaar karne main unhen 10 saal kaa samay laga
 Every year about 7 thousand people come to see these gardens
 unke ghar ke baahar lage ye phool kisi gulabi kaaleen jaise lagate hai
 Here people come to see the garden as well as the love story of this couple also attracts them

 bollywood star akshay kumaar ke soshal media par share kiye gaye videos par gaur kare to ek baat khaas he ki ve aakhir main jai hind kahana nahin bhoolatey
 Recently, when Akshay expressed his opinion on the Bangalore incident, he did the same
 jaahir he is baat se ye sabit hota he ki akshay 'apane desh' se kitna pyaar karte hai
 But you may be surprised to know that Akshay Kumar, who plays the patriot in many Bollywood films, is not an 'indian citizen'
 akshay kumaar canadai naagarik hai
 However, this information about Akshay has already been published in the media
 pehla, april 2016 main yah khabar ai thi ki akshay ko england kehithrow airportpar unhen roak diya gaya
 That's when many Indian people first came to know that he was a Canadian citizen and had a Canadian passport
 doosraa, 'rustam' film kii relies par bheeindia today main yah baat publishaui thi ki film ke kirdaar commander keem nanavati kii tarah akshay kumaar bhi canadai naagarik hai
 Despite this, many of his fans are not aware of this
 duusare desh kii naagarikta lene par radd ho jaati he bharat kii citijanshipaithhe economist main chhapi ek puranireportmen akshay kumaar ne kaha tha ki unke paas dymel citijanship he
 But under Indian law, no Indian can be a citizen of two countries simultaneously
 duusare desh kii naagarikta lete hi bhartiya citijanship khaarij ho jaati he
 According to a website of the Consulate General of India, at the same time, one has to submit his Indian passport compulsorily
 aisa nahin karne par fine kaa bhi praavdhaan he
 What do you think about Akshay Canada? In an interview given to a reputed magazine, Akshay said- 'I really love this place (canada), open spaces, beautiful plains, wide and clean roads
 ye bharat se bilkul ulta he
 But i also love India
 main canada kii windsar uniwarsity se doctoret kii degree lekar bahut sammanit mahasoos kar rahaa hum
 Although not a voting right, Akshay Kumar can be an 'overseas Citizen of India' after taking Canadian citizenship
 haalanki, 'oversij citijan' ko bharat main aaajeevan rahane kaa adhikaar to miltaa he, lekin vot dene yaa phir chunaav ladane kaa adhikaar nahin hota

 It is believed that whoever has anointed this magnificent form of Mahadev gets the fruits of the worship of Sahasra Shivling

 From here, devotees fill water and offer water to the Shivling

 Here Mahadev supports the losers and gives blessings of happiness to the afflicted

 On the first day, as the opposition showed its attitude to surround the government on the 2G scam, it seems that the coming days will be a headache for the government

 Even though the Bharatiya Janata Party has made Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi its poster boy for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 par unki tasviir party ke un chunavi parchon se gaayab he, jinhen dilli ke muslim ilaakon main baant ja rahaa he
 These party papers include photographs of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Shahnawaz Hussain, minority cell chief Abdul Rashid Ansari and Delhi BJP chief Vijay Goel, but Modi is absent
 vaise is parche se party ke varisht netaa laal krishna adwani kii tasviir bhi nadaarad he
 According to BJP sources, the party's electoral strategy is behind this
 party kaa maananaa he ki 2008 ke dilli vidhansabha chunaav main party ko un 17 siton par haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa jahaan par muslim matadaataaon ne ekajute hokar unke khilaaf vot daale
 Now that Modi's claim to the post of Prime Minister has become stronger in the party, the BJP is afraid that once again minority voters can vote against the party's candidates
 haalaakin ansaari ne yah daawa kiya he ki desh main kai muslim congress se naaraaz hai
 They feel that the ruling party has betrayed them and because of this they are turning to BJP
 gauratlab modi ko dilli bijepi main modi ko lekar yah matbhed ke pehle swar nahin hai
 Earlier it was reported that the cracks in the Delhi unit were openly exposed at the BJP state executive meeting

 Comparing this demand of the BJP with the Emergency, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said that in such a situation, the Chief Minister and the Prime Minister should also be silenced
 nishpaksh chunaav ke liye 'saamana' par bain kii maangmaharashtramen chunaav ke din saamana kaa prakaashan band karaane ke liye bijepi ne chunaav ayog ko chitthee likhi he
 The BJP has demanded that the publication of 'saamana' for a fair election on February 16, 20 and 21 is necessary as the publication of this mouthpiece of the Shiv Sena would be in violation of the code of conduct
 shivasena par chunaav aachaar samhita ke ulanghan kaa aropabijepi kii pravaktaa shalini kahati hai ki saamana ke aurangabad sanskaran main party kaa prachaar kiya gaya, jabaki jila parishad kaa chunaav prachaar band ho chukaa he
 Elections for the 15 district councils of Maharashtra are to be held on February 16, for which campaigning stopped on the evening of February 14
 shalini ne aarope lagaaya ki saamana ke sanskaran main party kaa prachaar sidhe-sidhe chunaav aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan he or isliechunaav ayogko is akhbaar kaa prakaashan band karana chahie
 The demand for immediate action against the Shiv Sena also demands that the newspaper should not be published on 16, 20 and 21 February for free and fair elections
 chunaav aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan karne par bijepi ne saamana ke sampadak or shivasena ke khilaaf tatkaal karrwai kii maang kii he
 bjp's demand is absurd: Uddhav Thackeray said on Uddhav, 'it is absurd, BJP BJP will ban the speaking of its PM and CM
 ' pune main ek sabha ko sambodhit kar rahe uddhav ne is maang kii tulana apatkaal se kar etraj jataayaa
