 During the election campaign, Urmila, the Congress candidate, however, it is not considered as easy for Urmila
 kyonki 2014 main bijepi ke gopal shetty ne congress ke bade chehre sanjay nirupam ko buree tarah se haraaya tha
 Gopal Shetty received 6,64,004 votes, while Sanjay Nirupam, despite being the then MP, managed to get just 2,17,422 votes
 lekin 2004 loksabhaa chunaav ke aankadon par gaur kiya jaae to staradam ke saamne raajnneetik varishthata feeki pad gai thi
 In 2004, Congress had played bet on the famous actor Govinda on this seat, a BJP stronghold
 centre main atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar thi or har taraf shining india kaa naaraa buland kiya ja rahaa tha
 On the other hand, there was BJP veteran Ram Naik, who had made his mark in the politics of Maharashtra Assembly in front of Govinda in front of Jana Sangh and Janata Party
 sirf itnaa hi nahin, kai baar ke saansad ram nike tatkaaleen vaajapeyi sarkaar main kendriya mantri the
 But Govinda's magic was such that Ram Naik's stature fell short in front of him
 govinda ko saadhe 5 lakh se zyada vot mili, jabaki ram nike sava paanch lakh vot hi paa sake
 In this way Govinda's victory became a matter of discussion all over the country
 2004 ke chunaav main sonia gandhi ke saath govindisase pehle ek or bollywood sitare kii jeet ne surkhiyaan batori thim, jab superstar amitabh bachchan ne hemavathi nandan bahuguna jaise badi raajnneetik chehre ko parrast kiya tha
 After the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1984, Amitabh registered this historic victory from Allahabad seat in UP
 amitabh ke alaava hema malini, shatrughna sinha, rajesh khanna, vinod khanna, paresh rawal or kiran kher jaisi bollywood hastiyaan bhi loksabhaa chunaav main bade netaaon ko chunaav maidan main maat de chuki hai
 But right now the interesting battle is on the Mumbai North seat
 mumbai north seat kii maujuuda paristhitiyaan bhi 2004 se milti julati hui hai
 At the center, Modi government has an absolute majority in place of Vajpayee and the functioning of his government is also being widely publicized like Shining India
 aise main kya mumbai north seat se govinda jaisaa karnama urmila kar paaengi, yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga

 Here, the marriage of a married girl was only that she did not bring a car in dowry, she did not bring expensive jewelry in dowry
 dher sara cash bhi nahin laai thi
 For him, taking birth in a poor family became his biggest crime
 phir kya tha, uske pati ne uski maang sindur se sajaane kii bajaay uske maathe par likh daalaa tha 'meraa baap chor he'
 Such is the story of sitard's pain for dowry, that of a married woman from Alwar, Rajasthan
 darasal peedita ke pita ne pichley saal bade armaanon se apni beti kii shaadi alvar ke rajgad nivasee jaggu se kii thi
 It was not even six months before the marriage that the in-laws started pressuring the victim to bring dowry
 unhone peedita se apane maayke se 51 hajaar rupaye laane kii baat kahi
 If there was a dowry in the maternal home, the victim might have tried to say this to the parents
 magar sab kuch jaanate-samajhate hue vah apane sasuraaliyon kaa har julm-o-sitam sahane lagi
 Each time the threshold of tyranny started to be exceeded
 maathe par likh diya 'meraa baap chor he'had to tab ho gai jab ek din pati ne dahej na laane kii use aisi sajaa de daali ki kisi kii bhi ruh kaanp jaae
 The husband first attacked the victim fiercely
 uske baad usne apni patni ke maathe par likh diya 'meraa baap chor he'
 When so much of that bloodthirsty husband did not fill his mind, he got the machine's hands and thighs slammed with profanity
 chaaku se uski jaanghon ko kureda gaya
 If the intrest of oppression had stopped here on that helpless woman, there would have been a pity on her
 magar dahej ke laalchee sasuraaliyon ne to peedita par julm dhane kii har had paar karne kii thaan lee thi
 After writing lewd abuses on his body, his cruel father-in-law and brother-in-law raped him and forged his soul
 sab kuch saha magar nahin maani haraitna kuch sahane ke baavjood peedita ne halaaton se haar nahin maani
 Somehow she ran away from the clutches of those bloodthirsty and somehow reached her home in Amer

 Police officers were also surprised to hear the stories of the victim's atrocities
 police ne fouran peedita kaa medical karavaaya or aropiyon kii talash main alvar ja pahunchi
 As soon as the police came to know that all the accused escaped
 philhal police ne aropiyon kii dharpakad ke liye ek vishesh team banaai he

 The family is now waiting for justice, the victim said that she was assaulted by her in-laws, stating her objections
 uske sasur or jeth ne uske saath balaatkaar kiya
 They used to make him roam in the village after writing profane abuses on his body
 gaanv vaale uski majaak banaate the, us par hansate the
 The victim's father said, "he wiped out the abuses written on the daughter's body with lime and acid, but he will never be able to wipe the wounds that were made on the daughter's heart
" unhone police adhikariyon se insaaf kii guhaar lagaate hue kaha ki jinhone unki beti kii jindagi barbaad kii he, unke khilaaf kadi se kadi karrwai honi chahie

 What is it in Mahendra Singh Dhoni who became the charioteer of the aspirations of more than one billion Indians after winning the World Cup semi-final against Pakistan, which sets him apart from other contemporary captains
 indore ke bhartiya prabandhan santhaan (im-ai) main hua taaja adhyayan bataata he ki team india ke ‘captain kool’ aguwai ke paanch ‘corporate’ guron se las hai, jo unhen maidani or ‘dimagi’ khel main sirmaur banaate hai
 According to the study, due to these tricks, Captain Dhoni managed to beat a fierce opponent like Pakistan
 ab srilanka ke khilaaf mumbai kevankhede stadiumme do april ko hone vaale vishwa cap final main unki captaini kii ek baar phir paimaaish honi he
 Professor Prashant Salwan, who taught Strategic Management at IIM-I, studied Dhoni's hegemony against the backdrop of the indo-pak clash full of pressure and clout
 salwan ne apane adhyayan ke hawaale se bataaya, ‘dhoni kaa pehla gur he ki vah ek team player hai
 You must have seen many times that he did not bat his natural style aggressively in the interest of the team and took everyone along
 ’im-ai ke adhyayan ke mutabik dhoni kaa gur number do he ki vah apane khilaadiyon kii khoobiyon or khaamiyon ko bhaleebhanti jaanate hai or tamaam jokhimon ke baavjood un par bharosa karte hai
 Salwan said, "like the president of a corporate firm, Dhoni knows very well when and how to capitalize on the strength of the team
" pakistan ke khilaaf ahm semifinal main aar
 It was risky to try Ashish Nehra in place of Ashwin, but ultimately Kamyab testifies to this same quality of Faisaladhoni
 ’bhartiya cricket team ke 29 varshiya captain kaa teesraa gur he ki vah ek sangrakshak kii tarah khilaadiyon ko unki pratibha ke vikaas kaa puraa mauka dete hai
 This brings both confidence and mutual confidence in the players
 salwan ne kaha, ‘aisa laga ki pakistan ke khilaaf vishwa cap semifinal main dhoni yuvaraj singh, harbhajan singh or suresh raina main man main umad rahe bhaavnaatmak jowar ko jaanchane main kaamyaab rahe or unhen maidan ke bahari vaataavaran se prabhavit hue bina apane lakshya par dhyaan kendrit karne kii ore agrasar kiya
 IIM-I study, counting Dhoni's fourth tricks, shows that he specializes in changing the strategy of a game that is full of uncertainty, depending on the occasion and the environment
 adhyayan main kaha gaya he, ‘pakistan se khele gayi vishwa cap semifinal match main dhoni ne kshetrarakshakon or gendbaajon kii jamaavat ko sthiti ke anusaar badla
 He also managed his strategy
 ’misaal ke taur par bhartiya captain ne nirnaayak palon ke dauraan 42wein over main harbhajan singh ko gend thamayi, kyonki vah apane pakistani samakaksh shahid afridi kii is kamajori se waakif the ki vah lalachaati gendon par oonche shot khilne se khud ko roak nahin pate
 Afridi once again made a mistake and this aggressive batsman of Pakistan was caught by Virender Sehwag off the ball of Harbhajan on the score of just 19 runs
 salwan ke adhyayan ke mutabik captain dhoni kaa paanchvaan gur he ki jeet yaa haar unke vyaktitv par bada asar nahin daal paati or donon hi suuraton main unki maansik dridhtaa kaayam rahati he
 He said, 'this quality of Dhoni keeps his mental peace, which helps him to plan for the future
 iske alaava, vah peshewar vyasttaaon ke baavjood apane parivaar ke saath majbootee se jude hai
 Salwan said that this young cricketer who belongs to Ranchi takes full care of the reactions of his fellow players, experienced people and experts while making important decisions
 yah bhi ek safal nayak kii nishaani he
 The government, which is facing the attacks of the BJP on the issue of terrorism, hit back at the main opposition party and said that bipartisan politics was not to be accepted in its DNA

 Addressing a press conference with Bansal, Chidambaram said, 'it is very unfortunate that whatever bipartisan politics was displayed two days ago, the BJP abandoned it so soon
 bhaajapa ke diene main dwidaleey raajnneeti nahin he
 He lashed out at both BJP leaders for addressing the press by Sushma and Jaitley after the Delhi High Court bombings, saying that they do not remember the opposition after the attack on Parliament (the NDA was in power in December 2001)
 The press conference was addressed by the leaders

 aam aadmi party ke supremeo arvind kejarivalko is baat kaa shaayad is samay ehsaas ho rahaa hoga
 Although Kejriwal would not like to be called a supremo, but the way he and only his picture is displayed on the front page of the AAP party manifesto, after that there is no meaning to say that the AAP party is not an individualist
 kam se kam is maamle main aap ne koi alag raajnneetik samskruti kii shuruyaat nahin kii he
 The AAP party is undoubtedly the party of expectations
 lekin yah beshumaar or lagbhag asambhav najar aa rahe vaadon kii party bhi he
 Such a procession of promises has been decorated in your election manifesto that now your AAP leaders might not even like to see that paper
 ve vyapaariyon ko khush bhi karnaa chaahate hai or mahangaai bhi ghataana chaahate hai
 If we see some of his promises, then you will get an idea of how Kejriwal has done the exercise of keeping a child in every hand
 unke saikadon vaadon main se kuch ko dekhen:1

 Now when Kejriwal is writing letters to Congress and BJP for support, it is evident that many big issues are missing
 swaraj jaise amoort vaade kaa puraa hona na to napa ja saktaa he, na uske puraa na hone kii shikaayat kii ja sakati he

 ) NCLAT ne sirus mistre tata sans ke chairman pad par behaal karne kaa aadesh diya hoktober 2016 main tata sans ke chairman pad se sirus mistre ko baahar kar diya gaya thaih ratan tata ke liye ek badi sharmindagi he jo apane sunahare kariyar ke antim daur main hainsirus mistre ko baahar karaane main ratan tata kii hi mukhya bhoomika maani jaati hanational company lau apillet tribunel (NCLAT) ne sirus mistre ko phir se tata sans ke chairman pad par behaal kar diya he
 It is a big shame for Ratan Tata who is in the final stages of his golden career
 sirus mistre or ratan tata kii yah adaavat pichley kai saal se chal rahi he or isaki jaden tata ke kaarobaari viraasat kii kai samasyaon se judi hai
 Ratan Tata is believed to play a key role in the removal of Cyrus Mistry from the Tata Sons board in October 2016
 unhone tata sans ke board main privet equity invester amit chandra, udyogpati ajay piramal or venu shrinivasana jaise swatantra nideshkon ko shaamil kiya or bordroom main takhtapalat karte hue mistre ko kinare laga diya
 Mistry was also removed from the post of director of all Tata group companies
 company se baahar hone ke baad bhi haar nahin manigauratlab he ki mistre parivaar ke shapurji palonji (SP) samooh kii tata samooh main 18 fisadi hissedari thi, lekin moinurity hissaa hone kii vajah se vah kuch nahin kar paae
 He faced a rival such as Tata Trust, which had a 66% stake in Tata Sons
 tata sans asal main puure tata samooh kii holding company he
 But Cyrus Mistry did not fall apart even after being out of the company
 unhone haar nahin maani or unhone beher chaturaai se is ladaai ko memaurity shareholder banaam moinurity shareholder kii ladaai main badal diya or tata group ko neshnal company lau tribunel (NCLT) main ghaseet liya
 But he did not get any relief here
 july 2018 main unhen yahaan haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 He then went to the even higher court of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT)
 har charan main sirus ne apane ko peedit dikhaane kii koshish kii
 The battle is not over yet
 On Thursday, NCLAT not only ordered Mistry to be the chairman of Tata Sons again, but also made several comments against Ratan Tata and his close ones
 abhi yah ladaai puri tarah se khatm nahin hui he
 Cyrus Mistry will not be able to become chairman until January 18, as till then Tata Sons has the right to seek asylum from the Supreme Court, but the order to appoint directors of the remaining three companies will have to be implemented immediately
 sirus mistre or tata ke bich kii yah ladaai bharat ke corporate bordroom kii sabase badtar ladaaiyon main se he
 This has led to many questions such as the promoter's right to abruptly remove top executives (in the case of Cyrus, no reason was cited earlier and later accused of non-performance) and gain huge stature after retiring How much executive executives (like Ratan Tata) have the right to interfere in their day-to-day functioning after rejoining the group, apart from corporate governance and mine Many questions about the rights of Oriti versus majority shareholders are also standing
 ab agar tata samooh supreme court main jaataa he to in masalon par vahaan phir se charchaa hogi
 Much is at stake in this battle, as Maslata ultimately controls the group, whose income is around 7
 8 lakh karod rupee kii he, jiske tahat 29 listed companiyaan aati hai or 160 deshon main faile iske kaarobaar main 6
 More than 6 million employees work
 mistre kii jeet se unke is aaropon ko phir se bal mila he ki tata group kii companiyaan viraasat sambandhi kai samasyaon se jujh rahi hai
 He had said that he had raised these issues several times before the company's board and Ratan Tata and also tried to create a framework to deal with them
 ratan tata ke in pasandida project par sirus ne uthaae the sawaltata sans board se hataae jane ke tatkaal baad mistre ne ek letters likhakar tata steel or uski europe ikai, indian hotels, tata capital or tata motors ke naino project kii samasyaon ke bare main sawaal uthaae the
 Mistry had warned that the five businesses he had inherited from his inheritance could lead to a $ 18 billion reduction in the group's books
 mistre ne aarope lagaae ki tata samooh ke videsh main adhigrahan se karj kii maatra kaaphi bad gai he
 Similarly, in the UK and Kenya, Tata Chemicals and Telecom business have also proved to be laggards
 tata kaa brain child maane jane vaala naino project bhi company ko kaaphi nuksaan pahunchaa rahaa tha
 Mistry also alleged that Ratan Tata forced him to enter the aviation business in partnership with Air Asia and Singapore Airlines, while not showing any potential benefits
 kya kaha tha tata sans nehaalanki tata sans ne in aaropon ko khaarij karte hue kaha tha ki mistre ko in sab nirnyon kii puri jaankaree thi or vah tata sans se diarector ke rup main 2011 se hi jude the
 Tata Sons said that despite being in office for four years, why did the mistry company itself not solve the problems they have been alleging
 ab sabaki nazren is dilachasp ladaai par hai
 Will he take the fight to its final culmination or, after regaining his reputation, now remove the bitterness and walk away from the company? However, given past experience, it does not seem that Mistry is going to give up this fight so easily
 pradhanmantri narendra modi guuruuvaar ko kaashi pahunche or road sho nikaalkar shakti pradarshan kiya
 During this, Kashi showed fierce love for PM Modi

 After this, PM Modi reached there and took part in Ganga Aarti
 iske baad piem modi ne jansabha ko sambodhit kiya
 He said that development as well as security is necessary for a prosperous India, for a prosperous India, for a prosperous India

 This road show of PM Modi was not just to show the miracle of his personality in Kashi, but to create a miracle in the election of Purvanchal
 ek aisa chamatkaar jo bijepi ko duusari baar satta tak pahunchane kaa jaruri rasta he
 Kashi is not just a constituency for PM Modi, but a laboratory of politics that has produced miraculous results for BJP
 wo modi kaa banaras daanv hi tha, jisane pichley loksabhaa chunaav main uttar pradesh or bihar kii 120 siton main se 104 siten unki jholii main daal di thi
 Narendra Modi understands very well how politics is changed by the color of the kurta
 wo acchhee tarah samajhate hai ki road sho ke raste se kaise dharm ke muhaavarey badale jate hai
 They understand well how to change the course of ocher politics with the aarti of Ganga
 aise samay main jab bade-bade netaa apni-apni siton par apane aatmavishvaas kaa vajan taul rahe hai, modi atirikt aatmavishvaas se labarej hai
 Banaras is not just the city for Modi, but the biggest message of his politics
 modi jab pehali baar banaras aae the, to kisi ko andaja nahin tha ki wo kaashi ko virodhiyon ke liye qayaamat main badal denge
 Mayawati had no idea that Modi would drag her from under her feet to the ground and reduce it to zero
 chhattisgarh ke bhilai jile main dil dahala dene vaali ek sansanikhej hatya kii vaardaat saamne ai he
 Where a young man just brutally slaughtered his girlfriend on Bina
 pehle usne apni mashooqa kaa galaa ghonta or baad main uske jism ke tukade tukade kar die
 According to a daily published from Chhattisgarh, this incident of murder is from the Maroda area of bhilai
 jahaan rahane vaale 24 varshiya yuvak camel deshmukh kaa subhadra naamak ek mahila ke sathprem prasangraha tha
 For a few days, Kamal was suspected of Subhadra
 use lagata tha ki uski premika kaa kisi duusare vyakti ke saath afaire he
 This suspicion had made Kamal's heart home
 wo subhadra ko bevafa maanakar badale kii aag main chal rahaa tha
 Due to this a devilish scheme was born in his mind and he decided to punish Subhadra for infidelity
 apane plan ke mutabik camel ne subhadra ko milane ke liye kutherail sthit apane pushtaini ghar par bulaayaa
 Subhadra reached her home on the call of the lover
 camel ne subhadra ko ghar main hi jamkar sharaab pilaai
 And when Subhadra got drunk, Kamal tied her arms and legs
 phir camel ne subhadra kaa galaa dabaa diya
 Due to being drunk, she could not resist
 kuch hi der main subhadra keemautaho gai
 The fire of lotus revenge did not calm down even after killing his beloved
 vah vahashi ban chukaa tha
 He sliced subhadra's corpse inside the house with a sharp weapon
 usne laash kaa sir, haath, pair or dhad sabakuch alag alag kar diya tha
 Now it was heavy to hide the pieces of the corpse
 camel ne subhadra ke jism ke saare hisson ko safed rang kii do boriyon main bhar liya
 Seeing the opportunity, he was thrown into the deserted area
 agle din subah gaanv waalon ko ne ek jagah par do safed bori badi hui dekhi
 On which blood marks were visible
 fouran is baat kii khabar police ko di gai
 Upon reaching the spot, when the police opened the sacks, everyone's eyes were torn
 bori se mahila ke jism ke tukade nikle
 The police did not take long to understand the matter
 police laash ko postmortem ke liye ravaanaa kiya
 If the matter was serious then the police also started to solve the mystery of this corpse in a deep manner
 chaanbin ke dauraan police ko pataa chalaa ki mritka kaa naam subhadra tha or uskaa ek yuvak ke saath lav afaire chal rahaa tha
 On this basis, the police reached Kamal
 police ne use hiraasat main lekar jab sakhti se poochtacha kii to sara maamla khul gaya
 According to SDOP Praveer Chandra Tiwari, this sensational murder case is considered as the 'rarest of rare' in view of the manner in which the murder of the woman has been carried out by the accused
 pakistan ke purv ballebaaz rameez raja ko bhartiya cricket team ke purv captain mahendra singh dhoni ko die gaye 'e' grad contract par sawaal khadaa karnaa baari padaa, or soshal media par bhartiya cricket prashansakon ne unhen jamkar khari-khoti sunai
 
 
 In fact, Rameez Raja has urged the International Cricket Council (ICC) that every year two months' time should be fixed only for Test matches, so that this longest format of the game can be saved
 
 
 emsisi world cricket cameti ke sadsy rameez raja kaa kahana he ki bhale hi england jaise deshon main aaj bhi test match dekhne ke liye bheed pahunch jaati he, lekin kuch had tak indian premier lig (ipel) jaisi gharelu tii-20 pratiyogitaaon kii vajah se asian deshon main test ke prati logon kii ruchi ghatati ja rahi he
 
 
 The comments rameez raja ne yah bhi kaha ki bhartiya cricket niyantran board (bisisiai) or pakistan cricket board (pisibi) jaisi rashtriya khel niamak sansthaaon kii bhi isamen bhoomika rahi he
 
 
 To justify his point, Rameez Raja also referred to the 'A' grade contract given by the BCCI to former Indian team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 
 
 unhone kaha, "aapako test cricket ke darje ko sammaan dena hoga, or use sweekaar karnaa hoga
 
 
 And it should be from the cricket boards, especially in Asia
 
 
 udhaaharan ke taur par, emes dhoni test cricket se ritair ho chuke hai, phir bhi bisisiai dwaara unhen 'e' grad contract diya gaya
 
 
 Similarly, Shahid Afridi has retired from Test cricket, yet the PCB gave him an 'A' grade contract
 
 
 " Indian cricket fans could not digest Rameez Raja's argument, and mocked him fiercely
 
 
 kuch bhartiya prashansakon ne rameez ko pisibi par dhyaan dene kii salaah di, jabaki kuch ne to unke camentator hone par bhi sawaal khadey kar die
 
 
 Some asked him to respect Mahendra Singh Dhoni, and some said that he should keep celebrating Pakistan's win over the Indian team in the Champions Trophy for years

 — Shah Raj (@raj0725_shah) July 5, 2017 Rameez Raja says that in Asia (test cricket) it is under a lot of pressure, but if a well-planned Test match championship is held, then everything can be right, otherwise more and more money available on T20 leagues Will continue to be spent, which will eventually cause a huge loss to Test cricket
 
 
 darasal, rameez raja ne antarrashtriya cricket parishad (isisi) se aagrah kiya he ki har saal main do maheene kaa vakt sirf test maichon ke liye tay kar diya janaa chahie, taaki khel ke is sabase lambe format ko bachaaya ja sake
 
 
 MCC World Cricket Committee member Rameez Raja says that even though countries like England still get crowded to watch Test matches, to some extent due to domestic T20 competitions like Indian Premier League (IPL), Asian People's interest in the test is decreasing in countries
 
 
 tippaniyan Rameez Raja also said that National Sports Regulatory bodies like the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) have also played a role in this

 In fact, Sai, after giving new bicycles to the cyclists of the team selected for the Commonwealth Games, asked them to fill the bonds

 The cyclists then refused to sign the bond and threatened to return the bicycles, but Sai, under pressure, has finally signed the bonds with these cyclists
 sai ke ravaie se naakhush ek cyclist ne naam nahin chhapane kii shart par kaha, ‘sai ne nai cycilen dete samay nahin bataaya tha ki band bharna padegaa

 kya aapane kabhi sochaa he ki america ne iraq par hamalaa karke saddaam hossain kaa takhtapalat kyon kiya, kyon wo syria se raashtrapati bashad al asad ko hataane par tula hua he, kyon use ab north korea ke taanashaah kim jong un se dikkat he
 If you seek the answer above ground, you will not find anything
 jawaab jaananaa he to jameen ke neeche talaashiye, kyonki ye sara khel jameen ke neeche khelaa ja rahaa he
 What is seen above is just a show
 asli khel ham aapako dikhaaenge
 Look and understand what the politics of the world looks like, it is not the same
 iraq se saddaam kaa takhtapalat
 Attempt to remove Assad from Syria and prepare for war with Kim in Abnorth Korea
 duusare deshon main ghuskar loktantr lagu karaane ke liye aakhir america itani jaddojahad karata kyon he
 Why does he worry about the people of other countries
 kya vaaki itnaa hamdard he america
 However, there are many countries where people still yearn for democracy
 un deshon se america kii daant kaati dosti bhi he
 Then what is the truth of this kindness
 zamin ke upar se agar dekhenge to lagegaa jaise america maseehaa
 But people accuse that America fought not to change power over war, but to hide the treasure under the ground
 haalanki ye tamaam aarope hi hai
 But then let us know that Iraq first
 
 What is it then under the lands of Syria and now North Korea
 
 Because of which efforts are being made to accuse the country like America
 darasal, iraq ke liye petrol, syria ke liye gas or north korea ke liye khanij padaarth unki arthvyavastha kii ridh he
 If they take it away from them, then they will not be late on the road
 or jo ise hasil kar le use rais hone main der nahin lagegi
 Separate from Syria and Iraq, America has put all its strength to tighten the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un
 america aarope lagaataa he ki kim jong un hathiyaaron ke liye apni sanak or ayyashi ke liye vahaan kii janata kaa bhookha maar rahaa he
 However, North Korea calls him the only and only American propaganda
 philhal halaat aise ban pade hai ki north korea america par or america north korea par hamale kii dhamkee de rahaa he
 Circumstances have become possible for nuclear war
 itnaa hi nahin america ne apana jangi bedaa korian peninsula main utaar rakhaa he
 According to a report, not only America or its allies but many countries like China are eyeing the gold buried in the form of mineral materials in North Korea's land
 kuch is sone ko dost banakar to kushkabza karke hasil karnaa chaahate hai
 Let me tell you that these are such indoor resources which have not even been touched yet
 or inhen nikaalane kii sahi takniki kaa istemaal kiya gaya to ratorat north korea itnaa amir ho jayega ki koi andaaza bhi nahin laga saktaa
 There are more than 200 precious minerals here
 ab zaraa in 200 se zyaada beshkeemtee minirals kii andazan keemat bhi sun lijie
 If they are taken out properly, then they cost around Rs 4,760 trillion
 ye itani rakam he ki agar ise baanta jaae to is dharti par rahane vaale har insaan ke khate main 67 hajaar rupye aaenge
 Experts allege that the world only knows about North Korea as much as the US wants to tell
 is sachai ko hameshaa duniya se chipa kar rakhaa gaya ki uttar korea kii ek sachai ye bhi he
 Which can change his world overnight
 zaahir he paison or takanic kii kameen kii vajah se kim jong un apni hi dharti par gade is sone ko baahar nikaal nahin paa rahaa he
 But he realizes his strength
 kim jong un ke hathiyaar prem kii vajah se north korea pehle hi kaaphi pratibandh jhel rahaa he
 And in the event of war, America's first attempt is to tighten the economic resources of North Korea so that it can no longer conduct further nuclear or missile tests
 jang kii sthiti main is taanashaah ko kaabo main kiya ja sake
 On the other hand, according to a report, the US intelligence agency is plotting to kill Kim Jong instead of CIA attack so that there is no threat of dictator and there is a government in North Korea which is suitable for American interests
 haalanki aisa nahin kaha ja saktaa he america sirf apana hit saadhane ke liye uttar korea se jang chahta he
 Rather, it is also trying to protect its nation from Kim Jong Un's nuclear missiles
 america raashtrapati donald trump kah chuke hai ki ab agar uttar korea ne kisi tarah kaa koi parmaanu yaa missile pareekshan kiya to america us par hamalaa karne se nahin hichkegaa
 But will it be so easy for America to attack North Korea
 shaayad nahin
 Because there are four such obstacles in the way of America, due to which the US cannot attack North Korea even if it wants a million

 hatakar isliye, kyonki amuman chor, thag, badmaash, mujrim jis sibiai se dur rahane kii koshish karte hai, is kahani main uskaa ulta he
 Here the thieves were sitting as CBI officers and the story was exactly like 'special 26'
 filmi parde ke baahar asli jindagi main bhi teen apradhi apane saathiyon ke saath milakar ek bade karname ko anjaam de rahe the
 The only mistake they made was that in the speed of raiding, they overtook even the real CBI person
 laalach main itane andhe the ki bina soche-samajhe dilli ke uttam nagar ilaake main tabadatod chaape maarane shuru kar die
 These raids also made people nervous about what has suddenly happened to the CBI
 iske baad dhire-dhire chaape kii baaten baahar aane lageen or ye baaten sibiai ke sachmuch ke ek dspi ke kaanon tak pahunch gayi
 What was it then, even the CBI got nervous and wondered which are the fast-fire officers who are being raided so much
 sachai jaanane ke liye ab sibiai dilli police kii madad leti he
 The CBI tells Delhi Police that someone else may be raiding in his name and looting people
 isi ke baad dilli police maamle kii jaanch karti he
 When the raid interrogates the victims, the real story is revealed
 kahani yah ki delli main bhi 'special 26' kii tarj par kuch shaatir dimag sibiiai afasar banakar chaape ke naam par logon ko lut rahe the

 a large number of fake cards were found from him
 iske baad police sachai tak pahunchi or udhar sibiai ke saare saamaan dilli police ke ek thane kii mej par saj chuke the
 Now the picture has been made in such a way that those who used to bully others so far, were arrested themselves in reality
 philhal teen pakade gaye hai, par teenon ne dilli main ab tak kitnon ko thaga yaa kitni jagah sibiai ke naam par chaape maare, khud inhen isaki ginati yaad nahin
 One of the three vicious men caught was in the business of making fake certificates and Icards for the last five years, while the other specializes in computer designing and the third in planning

 Mobile phones have been banned in the wedding venue so that the photos are not leaked
 upi main sapa-basapa gathbandhan tuutane ko lekar alag alag netaaon kii pratikriya aane lagi he
 UP cabinet minister Suresh Khanna said that he had spoken about the breakdown of the alliance before the elections
 pradesh ke up mukhyamantri dinesh sharma ne kaha ki pehle hi bolaa tha ki chunaav baad akhilesh ke liye buaa ke daravaaje hameshaa ke liye band ho jaaenge
 Law Minister Brijesh Pathak and BJP state president Mahendra Nath Pandey also gave a similar response
 pradesh ke up mukhyamantri dinesh sharma ne kaha ki sapa kah rahi he ki dalit chale gaye, basapa kah rahi he ki yadav chale gaye lekin uttar pradesh kii janata ne in jativaadiyon ko todakar bijepi ko vot diya he
 Regarding this alliance, i said that after 23rd, Bua's doors will be closed for Akhilesh
 up mukhyamantri keshav prasad maury ne kaha ki 'sapa-basapa lokdal ek hokar ladenge to bhi ham haraayenge, alag alag hokar ladenge to bhi haraayenge
 As far as Mayawati is concerned, the BJP, which did not get real, who made her CM 3 times, then what will she be of Akhilesh? And if Akhilesh is not with his father, what will happen to Mayawati? This is the battle of Snake Nath and Nagnath, i had already said that it is going to break
 'upi bijepi ke purv adhyaksh or maujuuda kendriya mantri mahendra nath pandeya ne kaha ki hamane kai baar ye baat kahi thi ki is gathbandhan ke peeche koi niti nahin he balki satta main aane ke liye gathbandhan he
 So it was to be like this but it would be surprising that it will happen so soon
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki upachunaav se dur rahane vaali party apane astitv ko bachaane ke liye upachunaav main aa rahi he
 BJP will contest elections in a spectacular manner
 ye unka sudhaar kaarykram he, koun kiskaa sudhaaregaa, koun kiskaa bigaadega yaa nagnath saanpnath ke alankaar phir se doharaaenge ye uttar pradesh kii janata dekhegi
 On breaking the alliance, Swami Prasad said that 'we had a complete feeling that the alliance will break
 yah tay tha kyonki yah sirf swaarth par aadhaarit gathbandhan tha
 There was no minimum program of this alliance
 janata se judaa koi raajnneetik mudda nahin tha, swaarthon kaa gathbandhan apane aap tikaoo nahin hota he
 That is what should have happened
 aaj ek duusare par ye taane maar rahe hai, aarope-pratyarope laga rahe hai, tu tu main main par utar aae hai, koi badi baat nahin
 'significantly, on Tuesday, BSP supremo Mayawati has said that her party will contest the upcoming assembly by-election alone
 samaajawaadee party ke adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ne mayawati ke bayaan par koi tippanee nahin kii lekin mangalvaar ko azamgarh main kaha ki 2022 main jab vidhansabha chunaav honge tab samaajawaadee party uttar pradesh main apni sarkaar banaaegi
 It is also seen as a sign of fighting alone in the SP assembly elections
 mayawati ne kaha ki vah samaajawaadee party ke saath apane gathbandhan se viraam le rahi hai
 He clarified, "this is not a permanent stop
 " unhone samaajawaadee party ko apane cader main sudhaar laane ke liye kaha
 He said that Yadav voters did not support the alliance
 unhone kaha, "agar yadavon ne gathbandhan ko baari sankhya main vot diya hota to dimple yadav, dharmendra yadav or akshay yadav jaise varisht sapa netaa yadav bahul siton se nahin haarate
 This is a matter of concern for the Samajwadi Party
 "basapa adhyaksh ne spasht kiya ki unki party ko samaajawaadee party ke aadhaar vot se koi phayda nahin hua he
 Mayawati said, "however, we cannot ignore political compulsions and we will contest the assembly by-election
" haalanki, yah raste kaa ant nahin he
 If the Samajwadi Party creates a missionary zeal in its cadres and improves its performance, we will see
 " mayawati ne akhilesh yadav or unke parivaar ke saath apane sambandhon ke bare main baat kii or kaha ki unhone unhen bahut sammaan diya

 The ship was scattered in two parts just a short distance from Libya
 sanyukt raashtra ne badhati ghaatak taskari ghatnaon main libya sarkaar par sanliptata kaa aarope lagaaya he
 There have been more casualties in such incidents, who went to Libya in search of work before the war started in March

 RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav called a Bihar bandh on December 21 against the sand mining policy of the Nitish Kumar government, but JDU gave a whole new twist to the entire case to air the call for a Bihar bandh
 jediu ne aarope lagaaya he ki lalu prasad ne 21 disambar ko bihar band kaa aahvaan nitish sarkaar ke khilaaf nahin, balki sikh samaaj ke khilaaf kiya he
 The closing ceremony of the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji is that the concluding ceremony of the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji, the tenth Sikh Guru, is to be celebrated in Patna from 23 December to 25 December
 prakaash parv ke rup main guru govind singh ji kaa 350 waan janmotsav puure saal manaaya gaya or bihar sarkaar shukrana samaaroh ke rup main saal bhar chale is kaarykram kaa samaapan samaaroh manaane ja rahi he, jisamen shaamil hone ke liye puri duniya se sikh samudaay ke log patna pahunchane vaale hai
 JDU has attacked Lalu for this program and alleged that Lalu's call of Bihar bandh 2 days before such a big program of Sikhs is an insult to the Sikh community
 jediu ne kaha ki saal bhar tak chalane vaale prakaash parv kii shuruyaat jab isi saal janvari main hui thi to nitish sarkaar dwaara kiye gaye aayojan kii puri duniya main tarif kii gai thi, magar samaapan samaaroh ke dauraan bihar band kaa aahvaan karke lalu bihar ko vishwa patal par apamaanit karnaa chaahate hai
 JDU spokesperson Sanjay Singh said that from December 20 onwards, people of Sikh community will start coming to Patna via train and airplane, but in such a situation, calling for Bihar bandh is not only to trouble the people of Sikh community but they To humiliate
 party ke ek anya pravaktaa niraj kumaar ne lalu ke bihar band ke aahvaan ko congress dwaara die gaye samarthan ke mudde ko 1984 sikh dangon se jodate hue kaha, 'congress kii najaron main sikhon kii kabhi bhi izzat nahin rahi he, chaahe vah 1984 sikh dangon kaa maamla ho yaa phir ab hone vaala shukrana samaaroh kaa kaarykram
 Neeraj Kumar said that by invoking Bihar bandh before such a big program of Sikh community, RJD and Congress have proved that these parties only pretend and profess secularism
 pehle 18 disambar ko tha band kaa aahvangauratlab he ki lalu ne baaluu khanan niti ke virodh main bihar band kaa aahvaan pehle 18 disambar ko kiya tha, magar isi din gujarat or himachal pradesh ke chunavi nattejey aane kii vajah se lalu ne bihar band ke apane kaarykram ko 21 disambar ke liye taal diya tha
 According to sources, the reason for this was that due to the election results of Gujarat and Himachal on the same day, his Bihar bandh program would not get media coverage and it would become a flop show
 yahaan yah bataanaa bhi jaruri he ki mukhyamantri nitish kumaar jo philhal vikaas samiksha yatra ke pehle daur main jilon kaa daura kar rahe hai, unhone shukrana samaaroh kaarykram ko dekhte hue duusare daur ke apane samiksha yatra kaarykram ko radd kar diya he or 23 se 25 disambar ke bich huapatnaamein hi upasthit rahenge or kaarykram main shaamil honge

 It took 14 years to make 'mughal-e-azam'
 ye film us vaqt banani shuru hui jab hamaare yahaan angrejon kaa raaj tha
 Perhaps it could also be a reason why it took so long to make it
 ye us daur kii sabase mahangi film thi, is film kii laagat taqariban 1

 i do not know how many years and how much money will be spent, but i can say with much confidence that it will make the film unprecedented
 ’prithviraj ke kehane par shapurji film ke financer bane or tab film ko paisa milanaa shuru hua
 By the way, a story behind the interest of Shapoorji is that Shapoorji was crazy about Akbar's personality

 rajasthan main pichley do dashak se har chunaav main satta parivartan dekhne ko mila he
 This time too, the people of the state have once again maintained this tradition by reposing trust in the Congress
 haalanki, pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv main jeet ke kirtiman sthapit karti ja rahi bhartiya janata party ne is baar itihaas badalane ke daawey jarur kiye, lekin vah mahaj chunavi udghosh hi banakar rah gaye
 One thing is also clear from the current election results, the fact that the anger was being spoken against Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and the Congress's clean sweep in exit polls, the actual results were reversing
 Huh
 rajasthan main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan bhale hi 'modi se bair nahin, vasundhara teri khayr nahin' jaise naaron kii gunj sunai di ho, lekin bijepi ke pradarshan ko sammanjanak mana ja rahaa he
 Actually, see the election results of 2003 and 2008 and 2013, there was a change of power in every election, but the difference of seats between BJP and Congress has been interesting
 2003 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko 120 siten mili thim or vasundhara raaje ke netritv main bijepi kii sarkaar bani thi
 Raje commanded the state for the first time
 iske baad 2008 ke chunaav hue to congress ko 96 siten milin or bijepi 78 siton ke saath bahumat se 22 seat dur rah gai
 That is, despite the anti-incumbency wave, BJP got 78 seats in 2008 under Vasundhara Raje
 vahiin, 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav kii baat kii jaae to bijepi ne congress ko na sirf satta se baahar kiya, balki 163 seat paakar ekatarfa jeet hasil kii or congress mahaj 21 siton par rah gai
 At the moment, in the results that have been coming up so far, the Congress has definitely moved ahead with the figures of majority, but the BJP is also leading in more than 80 seats
 ek or vajah ye bhi he ki satta ke galiyaaron main vasundhara raaje ke netritv par sawaal uthaae ja rahe the
 At the same time, there were repeated allegations that the coordination between Vasundhara Raje and the top leadership of the BJP was not right, due to which internal discord was being discussed in the party
 jab vasundhara raaje tamaam gutbaji se aage badhate hue chunaav main gayi to agsit pole ke ekatarfa nateezon se aage badhkar bijepi bahumat ke aankade se zyada dur nahin rahi
 However, the final results are yet to come

 haalanki asaram ne indore main patrakaron se kaha, “mere khilaaf lage aarope behuda or niraadhaar hai
 i am being implicated under the conspiracy
 ”lekin jodhpur police asaram par lage aaropon ko gambhir maanati he or sajeesh kii baat ko khaarij kar rahi he

 It will be necessary to save runs and catch catches for the win
 "if Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is worried about fitness then this concern is justified
 lekin yah kahana sahi nahin he ki team main ucch str kii fitness kaa abhaav he
 It is almost like saying that Indians do not know how to run or catch catches between wickets
 yahaan tak ki sachin tendulkar ne kuch behad mushkil kaich pakade hai
 Hopefully, Indians will remember this
 vishwa cap ab garmane laga he, isliye ab fielding bahut ahm ho jaaegi
 Fielding and fitness are two different things and Dhoni's boys are not far behind in these, but i definitely saw some problems regarding the team's bowling ability
 kisi bhi team ke liye fitness or fielding aise gun hai jo khilaadi main swaabhaavik rup se hone chahie kyonki maidan par khilaadi kii safalataa ke liye ye donon behad ahm hai
 An unsuccessful batsman can play a role in getting great run outs and an unsuccessful bowler can run fast and save some extra runs
 donon bahut myne rakhte hai
 Such examples are full in international cricket
 bhartiya upmahadweep kii fielding or dakshin africa, austrailia or england kii fielding main kaaphi fark he
 The weather here makes you quite tired by the end of the game
 jyon-jyon khel aage badhata jaataa he, khilaadi dabaav mahasoos karne lagata he
 Being sweaty, at times he is not able to keep an eye on the ball and on very delicate occasions, he is not able to catch a catch as the ball slips due to sweat in the palm
 dhoni ke kai yuva khilaadi super feet hai
 The IPL, in which the player has to be very agile, has also helped the Indian team
 khilaadiyon ko teji se ran banane honge, teji se wicket lene honge or atirikt ran rokane honge
 They have to maintain a high level of fitness
 kai logon kaa kahana he ki bade score se jeet hasil karne main madad milegi
 But this is not correct
 jo ran bachaae jaaenge ve hi jeet or haar ke bich antar laaenge
 Once again it comes to fitness here
 dhoni is baat se chintit bhi hai kyonki kuch kaich chode gaye hai or kuch atirkti ran bhi dene pade hai
 But due to these, he has not lost any match
 bhartiya surakshit tarah se aage bad rahe hai
 Let the boys enjoy the game

 According to the news, Sidhu's wife had said in an interview that now he will focus on the politics of Punjab and in this case he has recorded all the programs till September 30

 ) Anna Hazare, who is considered a social worker and a guru of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, has since made a statement about the conduct of 'AAP' leaders, the BJP has started cashing in on the 'anna Card'
 dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay ne anna ke naam ek chitthee likhi he
 In this, he has been requested to come to Delhi and see the fate in Delhi done by Kejriwal government
 bijepi ne anna hajaare se apil kii he ki wo kejariwal ke mantri or unke saathi netaaon ke aacharan ko dekhakar apni raay jarur saamne rakhen
 Satish Upadhyay has written in the letter, 'anna you should come to Delhi and see the functioning of the Kejriwal government and the conduct of their leaders because the Aam Aadmi Party gave an example of your ideals in front of Delhi people to contest and win elections
 'kiya tha saaf-suthri chhavi kaa vaadachitthee main kejariwal sarkaar ke barkhaast mantri sandip kumaar kii ghatana kaa pramukhataa se zikr kiya gaya he
 It has also been written that Kejriwal's claim was to start politics with people with a clean image
 jo ummidavaar chune jane the, unki kai staron par jaanch karwaane kaa daawa kiya gaya tha
 Kejriwal also showed the dream of purity politics by removing the mess of politics on the platform of Anna Thousand at Ramlila Maidan
 lekin raajnneeti main aane ke baad ab unki party main wo sab saamne aa rahaa he, jisko wo ganda or galat ghoshit karte aae the
 The party is deviating from the ideals, Satish Upadhyay, inviting Anna Hazare to Delhi, said that people have faith in you and Kejriwal also took this trust
 lekin ab na sirf aam aadmi party apane aadarshon se bhatak rahi he, balki unki party ke netaa sex scandle main fanse
 Not only this, the leaders of the party are also comparing their sacked minister to Mahatma Gandhi
 gauratlab he ki anna hajaare ne sandip kumaar sex sidi cond ke baad ek bayaan main kaha he ki kejariwal ke saathiyon ke aacharan ne unhen niraash kiya he or apni naaraazgi bhi unhone jataai thi

 hindustan times ko die ek intervyuu ke dauraan imran khan neviraat kohliki shaan main kahin ye khaas baaten
 
 
 1
 cricket main daur hote hai
 The 1980 era was followed by Vivian Richards and then Brian Lara and Sachin Tendulkar
 lekin viraat sabase zyada campalit batsman hai
 He strokes any part of the field, making equal movements with both feet
 2
 Imran said that he is not only talented but also a great player
 temparament ke maamle main wo sachin se bhi zyada aage hai
 Virat has played brilliantly even in very difficult conditions
 3
 Imran Khananti regretted Pakistan's defeat during the World Cup and said it was sad to see Pakistan lose
 lekin kohli ne shandaar batting kii thi or ye baat main ek bowler ke taur par kah rahaa hum
 4
 imran ne ye bhi kaha ki sirf ye dekhnaa chahie ki jab halaat kharaab hote hai to wo kaisaa khelte hai
 There is no doubt that he is the best batsman to date
 imran ne kii bharat-paak ke bich cricket tour shuru karne kii vakaltimran tii-20 world cap ke dauraan bharat main hi the
 During this time he also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 imran ne piem modi se kaha tha ki bharat or pakistan ke bichcricketke rishton ko behatar banaaya janaa chahie
 But Modi only smiled at Imran's talk
 gauratlab ho ki donon deshon ke bich 2008 se do deshon kii cricket siries nahin ho saki he
 Pakistan told the victim of terrorism, while advocating keeping the cricket from other issues, former Pakistan captain Imran said that everyone has condemned the Mumbai and Pathankot attacks
 ham bharat se zyada aatanki hamale jhelte hai
 In such a situation, it is not right to punish the country which has suffered more terror attacks
 england ke purv ballebaaj nik compton ne kaha ki dancan flechar ne kai diggajon ke sanyas lene ke baad bhartiya cricket ke mushkil badlaav ke daur ko sambhala he or vartmaan team ke tej gendbaaji akraman ko disha dene kaa shrey unhen milanaa chahie
 Indian fast bowlers took 19 wickets out of 20 at Trent Bridge
 bharat ne is match main england ko 203 ran se haraaya
 Compton said that just as Fletcher showed James Anderson and Stuart Broad the right path in their early stages, the current Indian fast bowlers (umesh Yadav, Mohammed Shami and Bhuvneshwar Kumar) received advice from this respected Zimbabwe coach Got the benefit of sachin se kohli kii tulana par viru ne bataaya koun he mahaan ballebascompton ne kaha, ‘bhartiya tej akraman achaanak hi is str par nahin pahunchaa
 It took time and slowly improved
 in sabhi gendbaajon ne samay liya
 India did not have so many fast bowlers before but now they have
 'compton ne kaha, ‘inamen se adhiktar kabhi na kabhi flechar ke coach rahete hue khele hai, isliye unhen shrey jaataa he
 (the process of grooming the fast bowling attack) This process started long ago, but now they are all doing well together
 ’compton se poocha gaya ki ab unhen kya antar najar aata he, unhone kaha, ‘purv se yah antar he ki ye tej gendbaaj teji se samjhauta nahin karte
 Such as James Anderson and Stuart Broad have the ability to move the ball quickly
 ’mahaan denis compton ke pautra nik kaa maananaa he ki bhartiya team prabandhan ko cheteshwar pujaara or anjiky rahane jaise khilaadiyon ko bhi aage badhane kaa mauka dena chahie
 Kohli's former controversial coach of India, said- the best batsman of this era, he said, 'he (pujara and Rahane) should be given a chance to grow into a strong personality in that dressing room
 ab pujaara or rahane ran bana rahe hai to bharat ke liye kaam aasaan ho jayega
 He said, "india won at Nottingham and they have got a well balanced team
" isamen badlaav kii koi jarurat nahin lagati he
 It will be interesting to see if Virat (in the fourth Test squad) makes any changes
 ’compton ne kaha, ‘chayan ke maamle main viraat ne kai badlaav kiye hai
 For example, allowing the wrong decision to keep Pujara out of the first Test match shows the weakness of the team management
 ’unhone kaha, ‘jab viraat itane adhik badlaav karata he, to pujaara or rahane jaise khilaadiyon ke liye yah aasaan nahin ho saktaa he
 He is not a domineering person and such players may find it difficult to reconcile with such decisions at times

 Actually, the screening committee suggested the names of 10 companies for the 6 coal blocks in the state, but this list was changed
 yah khabar angreji akhbaar 'da times of india' ne di he
 The CAG report has revealed that in 2007 the Ministry of Coal had not only approved the change in the list prepared by Madhu Koda for the coal block but also made some changes in the last phase
 aapako bataa den ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke paas is samay koyala mantralay kaa bhi prabhaar tha
 In this whole process, the recommendations of the screening committee for allocation of coal blocks were completely ignored

 The screening committee selected 10 companies from a total of 210 applications

 In June 2007, then Jharkhand Chief Minister Madhu Koda removed three companies from this list and added five new companies on his behalf
 3
 Madhu Koda did not give any reason for the change in the list of companies
 4
 The Center has stamped this list, along with it has added some new names on its behalf
 5
 The CAG had also sought a reply from the Jharkhand government in September 2012, to which no action was taken
 sieji report main kaha gaya he, 'screening cameti kii ore se sujhaaye gai companiyon kii suchi june 2007 main jharkhand sarkaar ko mili

 unhone is suchi main badlaav kiye or nai list centre sarkaar ke paas bhej di
 However, no reason was given for this change in the list

 See, when 8500 works were approved, when were they done when the election was in the head and that work could not start

 com / er9g8xrdprmukyamamwri ne kaha, dinadayal kaa chhattisgarh main koi yogadan nahin he
 No one knows Deendayal in Chhattisgarh
 ek iees adhikari ne twit kiya tha mujhe yaad he dinadayal ke bare main koi jaankaree ho to bataaen, mujhe jaankaree nahin he or itnaa hi usne fasebuk main daalaa to unka transfar kar diya gaya
 He was punished
 ye jo maansikta he vah galat he
 In the name of the great men who have contributed in Chhattisgarh, whether it be a road, building, planning, project, it should be there and they did the same in it
 2003 main jab inaki sarkaar bani thi to hamaare rashtriya netaaon ke naam se jitani yojanaayen chal rahi thim, usko badal diya tha to isamen ek vibhaag ne agar kuch badlaav kiya he to isamen unako aapatti nahin hona chaiye
 All those revelations will happen
 hamane esaiti gathan isaliye kiya he
 You caught the action diary in 2014
 2012 main usamen to aapane jaanch kiya hi nahin
 Now we took action without investigation
 un logon ko chhod bhi diya
 The third thing i would like to say is that you have been empowered that people should get justice, investigate, but how will you get justice if the investigation itself is faulty
 jahaan tak kii tatkaali iodblu chif the to unhone bagair ijazat phone tanping karvaa diya to ye to niztaa kaa hanan he
 Not just the officials but others including politicians, journalists too
 
 
 to unhone apane adhikaron kaa durupyog kiya isaliye unhen suspend kiya gaya he
 The government treasury of Chhattisgarh belongs to the public and not a handful of people
 isaliye agar kisi ne koi gadabadi kii he to unke khilaaf karrwai to hona chaiye
 At that time we said that we have done wrong, so we got the inquiry done again and on that basis the challan will be presented
 jahaan tak kalluri kaa maamla he wo to vaise bhi lupaline main hai, unhen koi zimmedaari to di nahin he
 He has given the responsibility to investigate a nan, because if Raman Singh was the most reliable officer, then if he will investigate against him, then he will do a proper investigation, he should not object
 unako field kii zimmedaari hamane nahin di he
 He is a person of free thought
 puraane samaajawaadee hai unhen naa to ham baandh sakate hai naa roak sakate hai
 He is the master of his mind and he keeps working in this way, ideologically i do not know his way

 He said, 'most of the pundits are educated professionals who will settle there
 main nahin jaanata ki pruthak basti shabd kisne gadha lekin avashya hi rugn maansikta vaale ne gadha hoga
 There is a difference between a separate settlement and being asked to come and settle in the same place

 Later other people can also come
