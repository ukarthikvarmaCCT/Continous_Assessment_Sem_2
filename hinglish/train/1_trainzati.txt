 The Double Bench of the Supreme Court while referring the matter to the Constitution Bench said that many organizations of lawyers have raised the petitions in the Constitution Bench
 in yachikaaon main kaha gaya he ki engeesi act ko manamaana or asanvaidhanik ghoshit kar nirast karne kii apil kii gai
 The petition said that this would increase the interference of the executive in the appointment of judges, which would affect the independence and impartiality of the judiciary
 sunwaayee ke dauraan centre sarkaar ne court main ise sahi tehraate hue kaha tha ki supreme court is maamle main abhi sunwaayee kar saktaa he kyonki iske liye notification jari nahin hua he
 The petition said that the Judicial Appointments Commission Act and the 121st Constitutional Amendment Act should be repealed, as it increases executive interference in the appointment of judges in the Supreme Court and High Court, which not only impedes the independence of the judiciary but also the core of the constitution
 It also affects the framework in which there is talk of an independent judiciary

 The petitioner said that this directly meant that the view of the Chief Justice could be ignored, while the Constitution Bench of the nine-judge Supreme Court Advocate on Record case said that the Chief Justice's opinion in the appointment of judges should not be ignored
 Whereas, according to the new law, a minority of the Commission (two members) can do so

 mathura, vrundavan samet desh-duniya ke anek mandiron main murali manohar ke bhakt prarthana-bhajan ke liye umad rahe hai
 That auspicious moment is coming a few hours from now, when Kanha Sakshat will knock at the door of his devotees

 The name of Kanha Jayakara is going to fill the heart of the devotees with new vigor
 duniya ke kai bhaagon main jashnjanmashtami bhagwaan shrikrishna ke janmotsav kaa parvahai
 God was born in Mathura on the midnight of the Ashtami date of Krishna Paksha of Bhadrapada month to destroy Kamsa
 bhagwaan swayan is din prithvi par avatarit hue the, isliye is din ko krishna janmashtami ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 On the holy festival of Janmashtami, not only mathura-vrindavan, but the earth of many countries of the world gets wet with colors of devotion
 is janmashtami par vishesh sanyogis baar jyotishi janmashtami ke is din behad shubh maan rahe hai, kyonki 50 saal baad grahon kaa aisa sanyog ban rahaa he, jo bhagwaan shrikrishna ke janm ke samay bana tha

 According to the scriptures, Lord Krishna was born in Rohini Nakshatra on Ashtami Tithi
 is din vrish raashi main chandramaa va singh raashi main surya tha
 The same coincidences remain today
 singh raashi main surya he, rohinee nakshatra or vrish raashi ke chandramaa ke hone se amritsiddhi yoga ban rahaa he
 By all means, the philosophy of Krishna's holy and supernatural form on the salvation of devotees blesses the devotees

 Kanha's darshan on Janmashtami will not only guarantee job, but unemployed people are also likely to get new jobs
 yahi nahin, bhakton kaa ghar bhi sukh-samruddhi se bhar jayega
 The unique occasion of 'vratraj' can be gauged from the importance of Janmashtami that its fast is called 'vratraj'
 manyata he ki is ek din vrath rakhane se kai vraton kaa fal mil jaataa he
 If the devotees bow to God in the cradle, then all their wishes are fulfilled

 Despite all the troubles, Sumona's parents call the campaign against Prime Minister Narendra Modi's black money as good for the country
 unka kahana he ki is maamle main wo puri tarah pradhanmantri ke saath hai
 However, he also appealed to the Prime Minister that even children in a country like Sumona, who are suffering from incurable diseases, should take some steps
 aisa karne se unke pariwaron ko bada bal milegaa

 Vat Savitri Vrat 2019: Vat Savitri Vrat is very special for women who believe in Hinduism
 manyata he ki is vrath ko rakhane se pati par aae sankat chale jate hai or aayu lambii ho jaati he
 Not only this, if there is any problem in the married life, then they also get away from the glory of this fast
 suhaagin mahilaayein apane pati kii lambii umr or sukhad vaivaahik jivan kii kaamana karte hue is din vat yani ki bargad ke ped ke neeche puja-archana karti hai
 On this day, there is a law to hear the story of Savitri and Satyavan
 manyata he ki is katha ko sunne se manavaanchit fal kii prapti hoti he
 According to the legend, Savitri brought back the life of her husband Satyavan from Yama, the god of death
 savitri sabhi gunon se sampann kanya thi, jiske liye yogya var na milane ke kaaran savitri ke pita duhkhi rahane lage
 Once, he sent the daughter to find herself a groom
 is khoj main savitri ek van main ja pahunchi jahaan uski bhent salve desh ke raja dyumtsen se hoti he
 Dumatsen lived in the same Tapovan as his kingdom was taken away by someone
 savitri ne unke putr satyawan ko dekhakar unhen pati ke rup main varan kiya
 Here, when Rishi Raj Narad came to know about this, he went to Ashwapati and said - Your girl has made a huge mistake in finding a groom
 satyawan gunwan tathaa dharmatma he parantu vah alpaayu he or ek varsh ke baad hi uski mrityu ho jaaegi
 King Ashwapati's face became discolored after hearing Narada's words
 "vrutha na hohin dev rishi bani" aansa vichaar karke unhone apni putree ko samajhaayaa ki aise alpaayu vyakti ke saath vivaah karnaa uchit nahin he
 So choose another groom
 is par savitri apane pita se kahati he ki pitaaji- arya kanyaayein apane pati kaa ek baar hi varan karti he, tathaa kanyadan bhi ek hi baar kiya jaataa he
 Whatever happens now, i have accepted Satyavan as a groom
 is baat ko sun donon kaa vidhi-vidhaan ke saath panigrahan sanskaar kiya gaya or savitri apane sasuraal pahunchate hi saas-sasur kii seva main rat ho gai
 Time changed, Narada's words impatient Savitri day by day
 usne jab janaa ki pati kii mrityu kaa din najadik aa gaya he tab teen din purv se hi upwas shuru kar diya
 Narada worshiped the ancestors on the fixed date
 nity kii bhaanti us din bhi satyawan apane samay par lakdi kaatane ke liye chalaa gaya to savitri bhi saas-sasur kii ajna se apane pati ke saath jangal main chalane ke liye taiyaar ho gai
 Satyavan reached the forest and climbed the tree to cut wood
 vriksh par chadhate hi satyawan ke sir main asahneeya pidaa hone lagi
 He was distraught and came down from the tree
 savitri apana bhavishya samaj gai tathaa apni god kaa sirhaana banaakar apane pati ko lita liya
 At the same time, a very impressive Mahisharuddha Yamraj was seen coming from the south
 dharmraj satyawan ke jivan ko jab lekar chal die to savitri bhi unke peeche-peeche chal padi
 At first, Yamraj explained to her the devi-vidhan, but seeing her loyalty and paternity, she asked her to ask for a bride
 savitri boli- "mere saas-sasur vanavaasi tathaa andhe he
 Give them divine light
 " yamraj ne kaha, "aisa hi hoga or ab tum laut jaao
 "hearing Yamraj, he said," Lord, i have no problem in following my husband
 pati ke peeche chalanaa meraa kartavya he
 "hearing this, he again asked her to ask for another groom
 savitri boli, "hamaare sasur kaa rajya chhin gaya he, use ve pun: praapt kar saken, saath hi dharmaparayan bane rahen
 "yamraj gave this groom and said," Well now you go back but she did not listen
 "yamraj ne kaha ki pati ke praanon ke alaava jo bhi maangana he maang lo or laut jaao
 This time Savitri asked for a boon to become the mother of Satyavan's hundred sons
 yamraj ne tathastu kaha or aage chal die
 Savitri still followed him
 uske is krit se yamraj naaraaz ho jate hai
 Seeing the anger of Yamraj, Savitri bowed to him and said, "you have blessed me to be the mother of hundred sons, but how can i become a mother without a husband, so you can fulfill your third boon
" Complete your word "savitri kii pativrat dharm kii baat jaanakar yamraj ne satyawan ke praan ko apane pash se mukt kar diya
 Savitri took Satyavan's life and reached under the Vat tree and Satyavan got up alive
 donon harsith hokar apni rajdhani kii ore chal padey
 Arriving there, he saw that his parents had received the divine light
 is prakaar savitri-satyawan chirkaal tak rajya sukh bhogate rahe
 It is believed that if there is any crisis on the married life of the worshiper or the life of a life partner, by observing the Vat Savitri fast and listening to its story, then it is averted

 Leh was welcomed with a traditional shawl
 raksha mantri ke saath arunachal ke mukhyamantri prema khandu bhi maujuud the
 This is the fourth visit of Nirmala Sitharaman in the last one year
 is dauraan unhone 'ajtak' se khaas baatcheet kii
 During the conversation, he answered many questions
 unke kaarykaal main hue raksha saudon ke bare main bhi sawaal poocha gaya
 BJP and Narendra Modi government are being accused of politicizing the army
 iske jawaab main raksha mantri ne kaha, 'bijepi koi raajnneetikaran nahin kar rahi
 Till now, the opposition was accusing the Congress of politicizing the army, but now they are also saying that we have also carried out a surgical strike
 agar unhen is mudde kaa raajnneetikaran nahin karnaa he to phir kyon bol rahe hai ki ek nahin 6 sargical strike congress na karai thi
 Some leaders are talking about 6, some 11 and some 15 surgical strikes
 agar raajnneetikaran nahin karnaa he to is res main padane kii kya jarurat he
 'nirmala Sitharaman said,' Congress is hesitant to say today that drastic action has been taken against terrorism, Modi government has taken strong action against Pakistan which is spreading terrorism
 ham ye baat samaj rahe hai ki aatankiyon ke khilaaf raajnneetik drudh ichhashakti se karrwai kii gai he
 On the question of Masood Azhar, the Defense Minister said, 'there are many terrorist organizations in Pakistan
 70 sanghathan aise hai jinke khilaaf pakistan main yaa videshon main koi na koi pabandi lagi he
 Despite this, Pakistan continues to spread terrorists
 aise main bharat ko badi kamyaabi (masood ajahar ko antarrashtriya ghoshit karnaa) mili he lekin isse sabakuch nahin ruk jayega
 Pakistan has to be blacklisted under the FATF (financial Action Task Force)
 pakistan ko vikaas ke liye dur daraaj ke jin deshon se paisa miltaa he, wo sab pichley 10 saal se aatankwaad main lag rahaa he
 India will continue to make efforts to stop this and increase the surveillance of the international community on Pakistan
 'pakistan ke khilaaf bharat kii aage kya karrwai hogi, iske bare main raksha mantri ne kaha ki 'hamaari najar lagaataar bani rahegi
 There will be constant pressure on them
 ' rafel sauda or rahul gandhi ke aaropon par raksha mantri ne kaha ki 'pichley saal rafel ko bebuniyaad mudda banane kii koshish shuru kii gai
 But their allegations are false, baseless, even if these things are clear, they stand on this because in the last 5 years the Ministry of Defense has been handling their work without any broker, they do not understand it
 ek baar unhen antni ji (congress kaal ke raksha mantri) ke saath baith kar sikh lenaa chahie ki raksha mantralay main kaam kaise hota he
 During his entire tenure, the Congress did not act as broker
 isiilie aisa aarope laga rahe hai

 The entire Bollywood is comforting them but Salman Khan has been behind on this occasion
 beshak vah in dinon 'tiger jinda he' kii shooting main biji hai
 But there is another reason for this
 bataaya jaataa he ki salmaan or aish kii lav story ke di and kii vajah unke papa the
 From earning to paying taxes, Salmanasalman, who became the 'sultan' of Bollywood, himself had told the reason, according to media reports, the relationship ended due to Salman Khan's domineering nature
 saal 2002 main donon ne ek duusare par khulkar iljaam lagaae the or iske baad salmaan khan ne ek visphotak intervyuu diya tha
 He told the father of Aishwarya that the reason for the breakup was that Aishwarya's father thought of me perfectly! Mehbooba Mufti's wish - Salman Khan, jk's brand ambassador Krishnaraj did not like this relationship is often discussed that Aishwarya Rai's parents did not like her and Salman Khan's relationship
 jis raat salmaan ne aishwarya ke ghar jaakar kaaphi tamaasha kiya, jisaki puri jaankaree aish ne ek intervyuu main di thi
 Pictures of katrina-salman leaked from the set of 'tiger Zinda Hai'! isi dauraan saamne aayaa tha ki unke brallep kii badi vajah salmaan kaa aish ke papa ke saath budtamiji karnaa tha
 He also said that he did not want our relationship by knowing about my life

 It is said that Salman Khan had confessed in this interview that he had lost a relationship with Ash because of his stupidity
 aish ke liye vah bole the - jis tarah main apane maa-baap kii beijjati bardaashat nahin karuunga, usee tarah aishwarya bhi aisa kabhi nahin chahengi
 Then who would be the father who would allow his daughter to go with such a boy

 com / jlibxymbtd — ANI (@ani_news) September 15, 2016 vishwa cap ke kuch maichon main dusron kii ummid ke mutabik pradarshan na kar paane kii vajah se jo log mahendra singh dhoni ko ritair hone kii salaah de rahe hai, unhen kuch baaten yaad dilaanaa zaruri he
 From 2005 onwards, Sachin Tendulkar has been advised to retire
 2007 ke vishwa cap ke baad sachin ne lagbhag tay kar liya tha ki ab ve nahin khelenge
 He was able to score just 60-70 runs in those three matches
 lekin tab vivian richards ne unhen kaha ki ve khelte rahen, kisi kii sunne kii jarurat nahin he
 Sachin accepted this - including ODI and Test cricket, completed a hundred centuries, picked up the 2011 World Cup with the team and eventually completed an incredible cricket career
 chahen to kuch or peeche laut sakate hai
 In 1983, great batsman Sunil Gavaskar was told that he has missed
 west indies ke khilaaf kanpur test main mailkam marshall ke kilaaf ve bilkul nahin chal paae
 He was also constantly advised to retire
 sunil gavaskar ne dilli test main apana rukh badla
 Left his batting protective approach and beat the bowlers fiercely
 unhone sirf 94 gendon main centuri bana daali jo un dinon khele jane vaale test maichon ke lihaaz se behad tej thi
 He was also probably the fastest century by an opener
 yahi nahin, is centuri ke saath unhone don breadman ke 29 shatakon kii barabari bhi kii or kuch hi din baad madras test main 236 ran banaakar sabase zyaada test shatak lagane vaale ballebaaj ho gaye
 His 236 runs were also the record for the most runs of an innings by India in Tests till then
 4 saal baad jab gavaskar ne balla tonga, tab tak wo das hazaar se zyada ran puure kar chuke the
 There are more such instances when players are advised to retire between their careers
 saurav ganguli ko bhi yah malaal rahaa ki unhen team se aise samay baahar kiya gaya jab unka khel thikthak tha or dusron se behatar tha
 As far as Mahendra Singh Dhoni is concerned, his performance in this World Cup has not been bad
 england ke kilaaf unhone aakiri overon main jeet kii koshish nahin kii- isko lekar unki bahut shikaayat kii ja rahi he
 But after Hardik Pandya's dismissal, trying to win in front of the sharp bowling of England would have been equivalent to losing
 chunki haal ke varshon main ham aisi hi harakiri ko cricket kaa romaanch samajhane lage hai, isliye yah pachaana mushkil ho rahaa he ki koi ballebaaz wicket na ganvaane kii shart par kheltaa rahe or match haar jaae
 The way Mahendra Singh Dhoni scored 56 on a difficult pitch against the West Indies was also a commendable compliment
 is wicket par kohli ke alaava koi doosraa ballebaaz karine se nahin khel paaya
 But Dhoni's expectation of something else became a reason for his criticism
 log yah bhul gaye ki dhooma-dhadaake bhari ballebaazi ke shoorma maane jane vaale yuva hardik pandya or rishabh pant bhi in maichon main balla bhaanjane ke alaava koi bada jaadu nahin kar sake
 Pandya's strike rate against the West Indies was lower than Dhoni's
 isamen shaq nahin ki mahendra singh dhoni pehle ke muqaabale dhime pade hai
 It takes time for them to set eyes
 lekin mahendra singh dhoni agar sirf dhooma-dhadaaka karne vaale ballebaaz hote to unki ballebaazi kii umr itani nahin ho paati
 He is one of the most developed cricketers of his generation
 shuruaati do-teen varshon kii lappebaazi ke baad unhone sanbhal kar ballebaaji karne kaa apana ek vyakaran viksit kiya he
 It is not uncommon that batsmen who have scored more than 5000 runs in odis are the most unbeaten innings in their account
 ve 84 baar naabad rahe hai jabaki is maamle main duusare number par khadey mark bewen 67 pariyon main naabad rahe hai or tisare steve wa 58 pariyon main
 Dhoni has been finishing the match on his own and usually his 'calculus' has played an important role in it
 jab unki samaj main aa gaya ki match unke haath se nikal gaya to jabaran balla ghuma kar wicket ganvaane kii hirogiri unhone nahin dikhaai he
 But there have been plenty of occasions when he has given up one run to take responsibility on his shoulders in the last over and has finally hit the target with a long shot
 aisa bhi nahin ki yah bahut puraani kahani he
 On the contrary, Mahendra Singh Dhoni's bat has been speaking fiercely for the past one year
 saal 2019 main unhone ab tak 16 match khele hai or inamen unka ausat 61 paar rahaa he
 Barring Virat Kohli, no one is around him
 is baat ko yaad kiya ja rahaa he ki 2007 main dhoni ne hi bhartiya cricket kii varisht trimurti ko dhire-dhire vidaa kiye jane kii vakaalat kii thi
 It is being told that if Dhoni had been in 2007, he would have dropped the Dhoni of 2019 from the team
 lekin 2007 main dhoni kaa tark fitness or fielding tha
 Needless to say that Dhoni fulfills this test even today
 ve bharat ke sabase feet or chust-chapal khilaadiyon main to hai hi, sabase achche wicketiper bhi hai
 Dhoni is 38 years old
 unke paas vaise bhi khilne ko bahut saal nahin bache hai
 It is quite possible that after this World Cup, he himself retired
 akhir test match bhi unhone bahut apratyaashit dhang se chode the
 But unless Dhoni makes such a decision, there is no justification for demanding his removal or retiring from him
 khel ko sabase baariki se padhane vaale ek varisht khilaadi ke taur par ve viraat kohli ke madadgaar to hai hi, kisi bhi samay match kaa pasa palatney kii unki kshamta ab bhi asandigdh taur par dusron se zyaada he
 But perhaps we are a cricket loving country living in extremes
 is desh main kabhi kapildev ko 432 viketon kaa world record banane dene ke liye kam se kam 25 test atirikt khilaae gaye
 Now some failed innings of Dhoni are overshadowing the people

 Voting on 9 seats in the last phase of Lok Sabha elections has been made a battle of credibility by BJP and TMC
 mangalvaar ko amit shah ke road sho main bavaal hua to der shaam tak kolkata main hi kai bijepi netaaon ko hiraasat main le liya gaya
 a complaint has also been lodged against the Bharatiya Janata Party chief Amit Shah in Kolkata after the uproar at the Kolkata Roadshow
 vahiin, bijepi netaa amit malviya ne aarope lagaaya he ki tejinder paal singh bagga samet kai netaa is samay hiraasat main hai
 Amit Malviya, the head of BJP IT cell, has alleged this by tweeting on Wednesday morning
 unhone likhaa ki mamata banerjee ne der raat bijepi netaaon kii dharpakad ke aadesh diya, kolkata main kai netaaon ko raat ko hi uthaa liya gaya
 Among them, apart from Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, there are many leaders who are currently in illegal custody of TMC
 Mamata Banerjee ordered a midnight crack down on several BJP leaders in Kolkata, who were picked up in the middle of night, without due process of law being followed
 Tajinder Bagga and several others are now in tmc's illegal detention
 # savebengalsavedemocracy # freetajinderbagga— Chowkidar Amit Malviya (@amitmalviya)may 15, 2019aapako bataa den ki mangalvaar ko bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne kolkata main road sho kiya tha
 There was a huge crowd in this roadshow but by the end there was a ruckus
 road sho main aagjanee kii gai, hinsa hui or tiemasi-bijepi samarthakon main hathapayee bhi hui
 The BJP is an attacker on this issue and can stage a big protest in Delhi, while party president Amit Shah can also attack the press conference TMC
 udhar mamata banerjee bhi is ladaai main haar maanane ke mood main nahin hai, mamata ne aaj kolkata main padayatra nikaalane kaa elaan kar diya he

 tiemasi kaa aarope he ki bijepi kaaryakartaaon ne ishwarchand vidyasagar kii murtiyon ke saath todphod kar di he
 Significantly, in the last phase of the Lok Sabha elections, a total of 9 seats are to be voted, this includes Kolkata city seats

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special newzlator Most of the social movements for the deprived sections start on the electoral path after gaining some acceptance
 vaise to yah badlaav satta or nyaay hasil karne ke liye hota he, lekin dalgat raajnneeti unke andolan se saamaajik jhukaav ko khatm kar detii he
 Chandrashekhar Azad's Bhima Army stands on a similar road, where it has to decide whether to take the electoral leap or continue as a social movement
 aaazaad ke saamne mayawati or basapa jaisi majboot 'pratidwandvi' hai
 In the same way that Azad is doing today, Mayawati raised the issue of excesses of upper-caste Hindus in the 1980s through her fiery speeches against Manuwad
 lekin aaazaad, mayawati kaa is sarvajan raajnneeti kii aalochana karte rahe hai or ve chaahate hai ki phir se bahujan par dhyaan kendrit kiya jaae
 However, they know that Mayawati has a place among the marginalized people of India and also knows that the time has not yet come to take a political leap
 isliye unhen saarvajanik taur par 'buaa' mayawati se takaraav se bachanaa hoga
 Political analysts and opponents may reject Mayawati, but her BSP still maintains a national identity
 ambedkarwaadi jamaat ke bheetar se milane vaali chunauti unke liye koi nai baat nahin he, lekin ve hameshaa bheetar se milane vaali chunauti par vijay paati rahi hai or unhone apni party ko rashtriya ambedkarwaadi raajnneeti main ek anukool or prabhavi takat banaae rakhaa he
 However, the idea cannot be dismissed that there is a kind of distance between Mayawati and the new generation of Ambedkarite leaders
 sach to yah he ki mayawati jab utsaah ke saath lakhanu main 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav abhiyaan kii shuruyaat karne ja rahi thim, uske ek din pehle hi 14 sitambar ko aaazaad kii rihaai unke prabal samarthakon or kaaryakartaaon ko bhramit karne kii ek ranneeti ho sakati he
 Azad's release may help the Congress regain its place in western Uttar Pradesh through its dalit-muslim alliance
 pradesh congress upaadhyaksh imran masood aaazaad ke saath lagaataar sampark main rahe hai or aaazaad ne jail se reeha hone ke baad unke sahyog ke liye aabhaar bhi jataayaa tha
 Both the bsp's political opponents — BJP and Congress — see opportunities for themselves in new leaders like Jignesh Mevani and Azad
 kai tippaneekar to mewaani ko aglaa kanshiram bataate hai
 While Azad has made a place in Ambedkarite politics from below, Mevani is a parachute-less leader in this world
 mewaani ne to apni rajnatik pari ambedkar, kanshiram or mayawati jaise netaaon kii 'pahchaan kii raajnneeti' kii aalochana ke saath shuru kii thi
 In the December 2017 Gujarat assembly elections, the Congress would have hoped that by supporting Jignesh Mevani, it would neutralize some of the bsp's influence
 lekin baad main use laga hoga ki basapa ke saath gathjod se zyada phayda tha
 At this juncture in our national politics, as opposition parties are struggling to find a concrete strategy to counter the bjp's dominance, Mayawati is also looking for an opportunity to expand her base
 apane rajnatik guru kii asal ranneeti par chalate hue ve ek majaboor sarkaar (kamjor sarkaar) chaahati hai jisase vanchit tabakon ko zyada moltol kaa avasar mil sake
 On the other hand, the BJP is also trying to woo the underprivileged castes
 vah ek aise nae hindutv ko pesh karne kii koshish kar rahi he jo ek samaveshi satya dharm he or jisamen sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas (musalamaanon ko chhodkar) hota he
 The Congress is also asserting its claim on Hindutva and nationalism
 shabdadambaron ko pare rakh den to abhi tak bhaajapa ke kathith samaveshi hindutv main to bhaajapa shasit kai rajyon main daliton ke prati hinsa main badhotaree hi dekhi ja rahi he
 The needs of laws such as the Atrocities Prevention Act brought to support Dalits are also being questioned
 duusari taraf, mayawati mandir-mandir darshan ke liye jane main apana samay barbaad karne vaali nahin hai
 They are effectively taking advantage of the bsp's national presence in a tremendous bargain with the Congress in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, where assembly elections are due
 daliton or anya vanchit tabakon ko 'apane liye' vot karne kaa aahvaan kar basapa us dastur ko khatm karne kii lagaataar koshish kar rahi he jisamen vanchit tabaka oonchi jatiyon ke liye vot karata rahaa he
 Mayawati has also created such situations in which people belonging to upper castes come down and vote for BSP
 basapa kii rashtriya upasthiti—or praasangikta—kaaphi had tak is tathy par nirbhar he ki uttar bharat main ambedkarwaadi dalgat raajnneeti main bikharaav nahin he
 Although there are many social movements, but the BSP remains the most important political voice of the Ambedkarites
 loktantric raajnneeti main safalataa ke liye santulan or vyaavhaarikta ke raste par chalane kii jarurat hoti he
 Azad knows this and now he does not like to be called 'ravana'
 lekin unke liye mayawati ke saath rajnatik takaraav mol lenaa abhi bahut jaldbaaji hogi
 They will have to maintain their militant Bahujanism in the social sphere for some time

 a recent diary of Mahatma Gandhi's intimate companion tells how his experiment with celibacy changed Manuben's life
 vah bhartiya itihaas kaa ek janaa-pahachaanaa cheharaa he jo aakhri do saal main ‘sahaara’ banakar saaye kii tarah mahatma gandhi ke saath rahi
 Yet this face is a puzzle to the people
 1946 main sirf 17 varsh kii aayu main yah mahila mahatma kii personal assistant baniin or unki hatya hone tak lagaataar unke saath rahi
 Nevertheless, Mridula Gandhi, popularly known as Manuben, died in anonymity in Delhi while remaining unmarried at the age of 40
 1982 main richard atonbaro kii film gandhi main manuben kirdaar ko supriya pathak ne nibhaayaa tha
 Four decades after Manuben's death, ten of his diaries were seen on India Today
 gujarati main likhi gai or 2,000 pannon main faili in diariyon kii shuruyaat 11 april, 1943 se hoti he
 Gujarati scholar Rizwan Qadri studied these diaries in detail
 inase pataa chalata he ki apni sexuality ke saath gandhi ke prayogon kaa manuben ke man par kya asar padaa
 They also evoke feelings of jealousy and anger that flourish in the minds of those in contact with Gandhi
 inamen adhiktar yuva mahilaayein thim
 The writing of the diaries began when Manuben, Gandhi's brother's granddaughter, had come to serve the detained Gandhi's wife Kasturba at the Aga Khan Palace in Pune
 gandhi or kasturba ko 1942 main bharat chodo andolan ke dauraan is pales main najarband rakhaa gaya tha
 In the last days of the illness, Manuben served Kasturba
 30 janvari, 1948 ko nathuram godse ne manuben ko ek taraf dhakel kar apni 9 mem bareta pistaul se gandhi par teen goliyaan daagi thim
 22 days after that, Manuben stopped writing the diary
 diariyon main jagah-jagah haashiye par gandhi ke hastakshar hai
 From these emerges the image of a girl devoted to him
 28 disambar,1946 ko bihar ke shrirampur main darj pravishti main manuben ne likhaa he, ‘‘baapu meri mata hai
 They are taking me to a higher human face through the experiments of celibacy
 ye prayog charitra nirmaan ke unke mahayajna ke ang hai
 The most blasphemous thing about them is condemnable
 ’’ isse nau din pehle hi manuben gandhi ke saath ain thim
 At that time, 77-year-old Gandhi was roaming in turbulent villages following the killings at Noakhali in erstwhile East Bengal
 gandhi ke sachiv pyarelal ne apni pustak mahatma gandhi: da last phej main is baat kii pushti karte hue likhaa he, ‘‘unhone uske liye vah sab kuch kiya jo ek maa apni beti ke liye karti he
 He used to take care of his studies, his food, dress, rest and sleep
 kareeb se dekh-rekh or maargdarshan ke liye gandhi use apane hi bistar par sulaate the
 a girl innocent by heart is never ashamed to sleep with her mother
 ’’ manuben gandhi kii pramukh nijee sevika thim
 She used to do all the work from massage and bathing to her cooking
 in diariyon main dow
 There is also a detailed description of the life of Mahatma Gandhi's female colleagues like Sushila Nayyar
 pyarelal kii bahan sushila gandhi kii nijee chikitsak thim jo baad main kendriya swasthya mantri baniin
 Besides them, Punjabi Muslim woman Bibi Amtussalam was also included in these women
 brahmacharya ke mahatma ke prayogon main shaamil raheen mahilaon ke bich jabardast jalan kii jhalak bhi in diariyon main maujuud he
 On February 24, 1947, Manuben recorded in his diary at Hemchar, Bihar, "today Bapu wrote a strong letter to Amtussalam Ben saying that the letter he received shows that the celibacy experiment did not begin with him They are somewhat angry
 ’’2010 main dilli main rashtriya abhilekhaagaar main milin in diariyon main yah bhi likhaa he ki 47 varsh kii aayu main bhi pyarelal manuben se shaadi karne ko lalayit the or sushila iske liye dabaav daal rahi thim
 On February 2, 1947, in Dusadharia, Bihar, Manuben finally had to write, "I treat Pyarelalji like my elder brother, nothing more than this
 jis din main apane guru, apane bade bhai yaa apane dada se shaadi karne kaa faisla kar luungi, us din unase vivaah kar luungi
 Do not put any more pressure on me about this
 ’’manuben kii tippaniyon se brahmacharya ke prayogon ko lekar gandhi ke anuyaayiyon main badhate asantosh kii jhalak bhi milti he
 In a January 31, 1947, entry in Navgram, Bihar, Manuben referred to a letter to Gandhi of close follower Kishorelal Mashruwala, in which he urged the Mahatma to be freed from his clutches, describing Manu as "maya"
 
 is par gandhi kaa jawaab tha: ‘‘tum jo chaahe karo lekin is prayog ke bare main meri aasthaa atal he
 When Manuben and Gandhi were traveling to Noakhali in Bengal, their two secretaries, R

 Parshuram and Nirmal Kumar Bose had left Gandhi, angry with his conduct
 yahi nirmal kumaar bose baad main bharat kii anthropological sosayadi ke diarector bane
 In a letter written by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 25 January 1947, he had asked Gandhi to stop the experiment
 patel ne ise gandhi kii ‘bhayankar bhul’ bataaya tha jisase unke anuyaayiyon ko ‘gahari pidaa’ hoti thi
 This paper is included in the documents of Sardar Patel in the National Archives
 mahatma ne manuben ke man par kitni gahari chhap chodi thi, isaki jabardast jhalak 19 agast,1955 ko jawahar laal nehru ke naam likhe gaye morarji desai ke patr se milti he
 Manuben was admitted to Bombay Hospital for treatment of an "unknown disease"
 vahaan agast main unase milane ke baad morarji desai ne likhaa: ‘‘manu kii samasya sharir se adhik man kii he
 She seems to have lost her life and is allergic to all types of medicines
 ’’30 janvari, 1948 ko dilli ke birla house main shaam 5:17 baje jab nathuram godse ne mahatma ko goli maari, us samay manuben ke alaava aabhaben gandhi bhi mahatma kii bagal main thim
 Abha was the wife of his nephew Kanu Gandhi
 agle din manuben ne likhaa, ‘‘jab chita kii lapten baapu kii deh ko nigal rahi thim, main antim sanskaar ke baad bahut der tak vahaan baithi rahanaa chaahati thi
 Sardar Patel tied me up and took me home
 mere liye vah sab acolpaneey tha
 Bapu was with us till two days ago

 i am not feeling anything ’’uske baad diary main agali or antim pravishti 21 farvari, 1948 kii he, jab manuben dilli se train main baithkar bhavnagar ke nikat mahuwa ke liye ravaanaa huin
 In it, he wrote, "today i left Delhi
 ’’ manuben ne gandhi ke nidhan ke baad paanch pustaken likhin
 In one of these Last Glimpses of Bapu, he wrote, "kaka (gandhi's youngest son Devdas) warns me not to tell anyone what is written in my diary and also what is written in important letters
 unhone kaha tha, tum abhi bahut choti ho par tumhaare paas bahut keemtee sahitya he or tum abhi paripakv bhi nahin ho
 In his 68-page memoir Bapu: My Mother, Manuben did not mention his feelings about Gandhi despite being involved in experiments with his sexuality
 pustak ke 15 adhyyon main se ek main manuben ne likhaa he ki unke pune jane ke 10 maheene ke bheetar kasturba kii mrityu ho gai
 After that Bapu took a silent vow and he used to say only by writing
 kuch hi din baad unhen baapu se ek bahut hi maarmik note mila, jisamen unhone unhen rajkot jaakar apni padhai phir shuru karne kii salaah di thi
 In this chapter, Manuben wrote, "bapu became my mother from that day
 ’’kishori manuben ne karachi main paanchavin kaksha tak padhai kii thi jahaan unke pita, gandhi ke bhattije jaisukhlal sindhiya steam neyvigation company main kaam karte the
 a few days before coming to Pune, Manu had lost his mother, so he too needed the support of his mother
 manuben ne apane jivan ke antim saal ekadam akele kaate
 She lived in Mahuva near Bhavnagar in Gujarat for nearly 21 years after Gandhi's assassination
 ve bacchon kaa ek skool chalaati thim or mahilaon ke hiton kii raksha ke liye unhone bhagini samaaj kii sthapana bhi kii thi
 In the last phase of life, Bhanuben Lahiri, an associate of Manuben, also belonged to the family of freedom fighters
 samaaj kii 22 mahila sadasyon main se ek lahidi ko yaad he ki gandhi ne manu ke jivan par kitna gaharaa asar daalaa tha
 He says that once Manuben chose one of his poor followers to marry him, she said, "I consider myself Meera Bai who lived only for her" Yamalo (krishna)
 ’’manovishleshak or scollar sudhir kakkad in diariyon ke bare main kehete hai, ‘‘in prayogon ke dauraan mahatma gandhi apni bhaawanaaon par itane adhik kendrit ho gaye the ki mujhe lagata he ki unhone in prayogon main shaamil mahilaon par unke prabhaav ko andekha karne kaa faisla liya hoga
 Apart from the flames of jealousy among various women, we do not know whether these experiments had any effect on the mind of each of them
 ’’ab manuben kii diariyaan milane se ham kam se kam yah andaja to laga hi sakate hai ki mahatma ne apni in sahyogiyon ke man par kis tarah kii chhap chodi thi yaa in prayogon kaa un par kya asar hua tha
 How Madhuben's diaries became known 1
 1969 manuben ke nidhan tak unki diariyaan main mahuwa main unke paas thim
 He had asked his father Jayasukhalal to hand over the diaries to Meena Jain, daughter of his sister Samyuktaben

 Meena Jain, a Mumbai resident, decided to keep him in his family bungalow at Rewa in Madhya Pradesh

 In 2010, Meena's childhood friend Varsha Das, who was then the director of the National Gandhi Museum in Delhi, went to Rewa at Meena's request and brought the diaries to Delhi and submitted them to the National Archives

 Lopamudra Raut
 
 
 'big bos' ke ghar kii ek aisi sadsy hai jinhen shuruyaat main kaaphi tarifen milin ki vah ghar main ho rahe galat ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaati hai
 She takes a stand for her friends
 vah sho kii sabase strong pratibhaagi maani ja rahi hai lekin pichley kuch saptaah se ham dekh rahe hai ki task ke dauraan vah apana aapa kho detii hai, bachakaani harakatein karti hai
 She cannot bear defeat and instead of admitting her mistake starts showing tantrums
 bani je kii taraf unka negative ravaiya bhi kisi se chipa nahin he
 In such a situation, when the show has come so close to Finale, then we would like to take your attention to some such incidents in this month in which Lopa's antics have damaged her image and the family members are seen getting away from them
 sabase pehle shuruyaat baat karte hai un ghatnaon ke bare main jab lopa ne logon kaa dil jeet liya
 When Swami Om misheard Bani's mother, Lopa forgets her quarrel with Bani and supports Bani and stands up against Swami Om
 iske baad lopa or priyanka kii ghar main jabardast ladaai hui, priyanka jagga ne lopa ko kaaphi gaaliyaan deen or kaaphi bura-bhala kaha lekin agle din jab priyanka ke bachche unase milane aae to apana jhagada bhuulakar bacchon se pyaar se mulaakaat kii
 Lopamudra is a strong contestant of Bigg Boss 10
 shuruyaat main jab bhi swami om ne ghar kii mahila sadasyon ke khilaaf koi coment kiya to lopa ne har baar unka virodh kiya
 She was supporting Manveer when Manveer and Gaurav were face to face during the captivity task and when Manveer slipped but instead of seeing him, Gaurav continued the task, for this Lopa chose Gaurav as the villain of the house, while the rest of the family om
 Swami was chosen
 is tarah ke kai maukey aae jab lopa ne apni baton or harkaton se gharavaalon or desh kaa dil jeeta
 But for the past few weeks, she has been doing something in a row that has led the householders to compare her with Priyanka Jagga and Swami Om
 bibi dhaba task ke dauraan lopa or rohan
 From the recent Bibi Dhaba task in which Lopa accused Bani j of possessing all the necessary material and getting nothing
 vah 'big bos' ko dosha detii raheen ki unhen chini, sos ke ek-ek packet / bottle hi rakhe the
 Rohan tries to convince them that this is the task but she starts showing tantrums that they do not have to do the task
 baad main jab lopa kii sweet dish ko manavir ne majaak main jehar kaha to vah uske liye bhi gussa ho gayi ki vah aisa kaise kah sakate hai
 Later Manu, Manveer and Bani are also seen discussing that Lopa's behavior is no different from Swami Om and Priyanka Jagga
 ghar ke andar rohan mehara lopa ke behad achche dost hai
 Before the Dhaba task, 'bigg Boss' gave the family a chance to raise the prize money of the show to 50 lakhs, in which Rohan and Lopa left together at the last buzzer
 iske baad jab 'big bos' ne sajaa ke taur par prise mani ghataakar 40 lakh kii or kaha ki ek saath baahar nikalnaa rohan or lopa kii planning thi or bajer se pehle lopa ne yah bhi kaha tha ki zyada se zyada kya hoga task radd ho jayega
 Still, to hide his mistake, Lopa took the cover of 'bigg Boss' that he did not listen to the whole thing
 vah 'big bos' par aarope bhi lagane lageen ki unhen paise badhaane hi nahin the or unhen sirf bahaanaa chahie tha prise mani ghataane kaa
 On this, Manu said that Lopa should not speak anything against 'bigg Boss' at least
 lopa ne zyaadaatar task jite hai lekin jab bhi unki haar hui vah chidhkar nakhre dikhaane lageen
 Just before this, Bungee task took place in which Lopa lost her temper as soon as the task started and she started getting confused with Bani
 lopa kii vajah se mili jatke kii vajah se manu ne apana balance kho diya or vah task se baahar ho gaye
 At the same time, Lopa was not ready to withdraw even after being dismissed from the task
 agle din jab task puraa hone ke baad manu-manavir ne kaha ki lopa kii parformens sabase kamjor rahi or unhone task shuru hote hi apana aapa kho diya tha to vah maanane ko taiyaar nahin huin or manu-manavir par aarope lagane lageen ki ve donon unhen torget kar rahe hai
 Regarding this task, Salman Khan also told Lopa that Bani's attitude towards him in the call center task was the same as his attitude towards Bani
 big bos ke ghar main lopa, rohan, manu or monalisa
 The parcel that came from Lopamudra's house in the postman task before the bungee task was with Bani
 jiske liye bani ne manu-manavir se kaha ki lopa unase achche se kahengi to vah unhen unka parcel de sakati hai
 But Lopa assumed from the beginning that Bani would not give them their parcel and she kept saying the same
 iske baad bani ne tay kiya ki vah lopa kaa parcel jalaakar khud ko surakshit karengi
 During this task, Lopa kept saying from the beginning that she knew what to do but she would go in the end
 haalanki salmaan khan ne kaha ki lopa ne keval yah tay kiya tha ki jaisaa bani or manu karenge vah bhi vaisaa hi karengi
 Salman told Lopa that if she had gone after Mona and given Mona's parcel, Manu and Bani might have delivered the parcel instead of burning it
 kol centre task ke dauraan lopamudra
 Although Lopa handled Bani very calmly during the earlier call center task, but when Bani became aggressive after the task, Lopa also became aggressive and told 'bigg Boss' that Bani should be taken out of the house
 is par bhi salmaan khan ne unase kaha ki yadi vah shant rahati or agreshan nahin dikhaatin to bani ke khilaaf jarur ection liya jaataa lekin vah bhi bani ke saath physical ho gayi is vajah se 'big bos' ne koi ection nahin liya
 During the mining task, Lopa lost her secret task for the sake of her friend Rohan
 tippaniyan Finally, we will talk about the ranking task and orbit task earlier this month
 ranking task main manu, manavir,bani or lopa khud ko number ek kaa daavedaar maan rahe the
 But Lopa insisted that she deserves to be at number one while Bani's last position
 iske baad hue orbit task main lopa ko phayda mila ki vah duusare round se is task main shaamil huin
 But as soon as she joined the task, she started accusing Bani that she was pointing to everyone to push and drop them

 lopa 'big bos 10' kii ek strong pratibhaagi hai lekin apni haar swikar na kar paane kii unki khami or apni galatiyon par pardaa daalane ke liye dusron par dosha madhne kii unki aadat kii vajah se unki chhavi ko nuksaan he
 Just a few steps away from the Taj, Lopa needs to improve his behavior so that his fans will not be disappointed and vote for him more and more
 vah final teen main apni jagah bana chuki hai lekin ab yah dekhnaa rochak hoga ki 'big bos 10' kaa tital vah apane naam kar paati hai yaa nahin
 Lopa is a strong contender of 'bigg Boss 10' but her flaws for not being able to accept her defeat and her habit of blaming others for exposing her mistakes have damaged her image
 taj se bas kuch hi kadam dur lopa ke liye jaruri he ki vah apane vyavhaar main sudhaar karen taaki unke phans niraash na hon or unhen zyada se zyada vot karen
 She has made her place in the final three but now it will be interesting to see if she can make the title of 'bigg Boss 10'
 2011 world champion team india ke sadsy rahe munaf patel ko lagata he ki australia or newjiland kii sahamejbani main agle maheene se shuru hone vaale world cap mentim indiyako jahir khan jaise gendbaaj kii kami khalegi auounubhavheen akraman timki khitaab kii ummiido par pani pher saktaa he
 'there is no balanced team like 2011' Patel, a member of the World Cup team twice, said that India's current fast bowlers are not able to play a good partnership and this is causing the team the most damage
 munaf ne kaha, 'saaf he ki team pichhali baar kii tarah santulit nahin he
 Sreesanth and i gave full support to Zaheer Khan
 vah (jahir) aisa gendbaaj he jisane 100 ke kareeb test match khele hai or jab vah overon ke bich main yaa dabaav kii paristhitiyon main aapse baat karata he to isse bahut antar paidaa hota he
 He also added, 'harbhajan was also in the team
 isliye sabhi gendbaaj anbhavi the or isse kaaphi antar paidaa hua
 This time there is nothing like this but i still hope that the team will do well and retain the title
 kul milakar team main bahut zyada anbhavi khilaadi nahin hai
 bhuvi-ishant will be on Daromdarpatel said that Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Ishant Sharma will be on Indian bowling but they will have to bowl in rhythm as India lost due to lack of it in the recently concluded Test series against Australia
 unhone kaha, 'test siries main hamaare gendbaajon main koi saajhedaari nahin dekhi gai or isse hamen sabase adhik nuksaan hua
 Just as participation in batting is important, it is also important in bowling
 ek taraf se dabaav banataa he to duusari taraf se hataa diya jaataa he
 Not as bad as Test in odis, Patel said, "here you need a bowler like Zaheer who will talk to you in the middle of the over
 vanade main sthiti test jaisi buree nahin he isliye ummid he ki khilaadi acha pradarshan karenge
 He advised the young bowlers to keep control of bowling at a fast pace
 patel ne kaha, 'teji or control kaa talmail bithaae rakhane se behatar kuch nahin he
 i would recommend the same to the current bowlers
 agar aap mujhase kahoge to kisi bhi keemat par teji se samjhauta nahin kiya janaa chahie
 If you choose the length on the speed, then it is wrong
 'input bhashaa se More than 4 months have passed since the visit of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to India, but some news related to this visit is still coming out
 ab khabar he ki trudo ne is daure ke dauraan ek shef ko 11 lakh rupye se zyada bataur bakhshish de di thi
 In February this year, there was no eagerness from the Government of India for Justin Trudeok's 7-day visit to India, despite this visit remains a matter of discussion even today
 bharat ke alaava canada main bhi is daure kismkar aalochanahui thi
 The case of costly expenditure came to light when the Conservative Party of Canada tweeted that Trudeau had paid Rs 11 lakh 65 thousand rupees (17 thousand 44 dollars) to chef Vikram Vij for a meeting in New Delhi during his visit to India
 Gave it as a tip
 is maamle ko lekar vipakshi dal trudo ko gher rahe hai
 Chef Vikram Vij of Vankavur came to New Delhi to cook for a meeting and was given a splendid gift from the Canadian Prime Minister
 vipakshi dal ne kiya hamalakanservative party ne apane aadhikarik twitor handle se twit kar pradhanmantri trudo ke is daure ko unki 'nijee' yatra qaraar diya
 However, this tweet was later deleted
 trudo is saal farvari membharataaaye the or unke is ek hafte lambey daure ko lekar unke desh canada main jamkar aalochana hui thi
 According to local media, the Conservative Party alleged that Trudeau spent more than $ 1
5 million, or more than 10 million rupees, on this tour
 saath hi unhone aarope lagaaya ki trudo kii is yatra ne bharat ke saath dwipaksheeya sambandhon ko kharaab kar diya
 However, at the end of last month, Trudeau recounted an India tour and made fun of him saying that he no longer remembers that tour
 unhone kaha tha, 'main bharat kii yatra par gaya hi nahin, uski koi yaad nahin
 Justin Trudeau then gave a 15-minute speech during a press gallery dinner showing a slideshow on 'india tour 2018'
 unke stage par aane ke dauraan 'jai ho' gaanaa baj rahaa tha, or unhone 'namaste' kahkar sabakaa abhivadan bhi kiya

 jiladhikari guuruuvaar ko ek diwaar ke sahare raahat saamagree baant rahe the
 Suddenly the wall collapsed and District Magistrate Surendra Singh fell
 unke saath rashtriya aapadaa mochan bal (andiaref) ke jawan bhi gir pade

 NDRF rescuers were also present in this boat
 bachaavkarmi ne jiladhikari ko bachaane kii koshish kii, lekin vah sidhe naav par aakar gire

 aap sabhi kaa shukriya
 Called from so far to listen even when no one is listening
 intervyuu kii vishwasaneeyata itani gir chuki he ki ab sirf spich or standap kamedi kaa hi sahaara rah gaya he
 There are no answers to the questions, but the blessings of Netaji are left
 bharat main do tarah kii sarkarein hai
 a Government of India
 duusari garvanment of media
 i will be limited to the Government of Media here so that no one feels offended that i have said something about the Government of India abroad
 yah aap par nirbhar karata he ki mujhe sunate hue aap media or india main kitna fark kar pate hai
 One has been chosen by the public and the other has chosen itself for the government
 ek kaa chunaav vot se hua he or ek kaa reating se hota rahata he
 There is media here in America, dock media in India
 main ek-ek udhaaharan dekar apana bhaashan lanbaa nahin karnaa chahta or na hi aapako sharminda karne kaa meraa koi iraadaa he
 There is a lot of good in the Government of Media
 jaise mausam kaa samachar
 News of the accident cyna or sindhu kaa jeetna, dangal kaa superhit hona
 It is not that nothing is good
 chaparasi ke 14 padon ke liye lakhon noujvaan line main khadey hai, koun kahata he ummid nahin he
 Millions of young people who are doing BA in colleges in six years are waiting, who says that there is no hope left
 ummid hi to bachi hui he ki uske peeche ye noujvaan bache hue hai
 a scared journalist produces a dead citizen in a democracy
 ek daraa hua patrkaar aapkaa hero ban jaae, iskaa matlab aapane dar ko apana ghar de diya he
 At this time, India's democracy is threatened by the media of India
 bharat kaa tivi media loktantr ke kilaaf ho gaya he
 The print media of India is quietly involved in a murder that does not see a flowing blood, but some of the work being printed in the corner is heard in the news of murder
 sibiai court ke jaj bi ech loya kii maut is baat kaa pramaan he ki bharat kaa media kiske saath he
 After the report of Caravan magazine, the anchors of Delhi started looking at the sky and reading the news of moisture content in the winds
 yahaan tak ki is dar kaa shikaar vipakshi partiyaan bhi ho gayi hai
 Their leaders dared after a long time to demand an inquiry into the questions of Judge Loya's death
 jab himmat ai tab supreme court ke chif justise kii bench jaj loya ke maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi thi
 Even after this, when the Congress party questioned the death of former judges related to Judge Loya, it was not published by the newspapers in Delhi, the channels did not show
 aisa nahin he ki garvanment of media sawaal karnaa bhul gaya
 How big a question did he ask on watching Rahul Gandhi's Star Wars
 aap kah sakate hai ki garvanment of india chaahati he ki vipaksh kaa netaa sirius rahe
 But when the leader confronts Sirius and holds a press conference about Judge Loya, the media forgets its Sirius
 doston yaad rakhana main garvanment of media kii baat kar rahaa hum, videsh main garvanment of india kii baat nahin kar rahaa hum
 In the media, is anyone scared of himself or scared of scaring someone, it is an open question
 dar kaa diene se koi lenaa dena nahin he, koi bhi dar saktaa he, khaaskar farzi cese main fansaana or kai saal tak mukademon ko latakaana jahaan aasaan ho, vahaan dar system kaa part he
 Fear is natural
 gandhi ne jail jaakar hamen jail ke dar se azaad kara diya
 Slave The poor of the poor and the illiterate from the poor and the illiterate of India were freed from the fear of jail
 2ji main do lakh karod kaa ghotaalaa hua tha, magar jab iske aaropee bari ho gaye to wo janaab aaj tak nahin bol paae hai
 Whose book is named NOT JUST AN ACCOUNTANT, THE DIARY OF NATIONS CONSCIENCE KEEPER
 jab 2ji ke aaropee bari hue, sibiai saboot pesh nahin kar pai tab maine pehali baar dekha, kisi kitaab ko cover ko chhipate hue
 You have seen this happen
 lagata he ki kitaab kah rahi he ki ye baat sahi nikali ki ye sirf accountint nahin hai, magar ye baat jhooth he ki ve neshans ke kanshiens keeper hai
 i am scared of that power when a scared media puts the headline of Super Power India
 main chahta hum ki vishwa guru banane se pehle kam se kam un collejon main guru pahunch jaaen, jahaan 8500 ladkiyaan padhati hai magar padhaane ke liye 9 teacher hai
 Then you will say if nothing good is happening
 kya yah acha nahin he ki bina teacher ke bhi hamaari ladkiyaan bie paas kar ja rahi hai
 Can you do this in Howard? Can show in Cambridge, show in Oxford, can you do it in Yale and Columbia? media ne india ke basic queshchan ko chhod diya he
 So i said that coming from so far, i will talk about the Government of Media so that you do not feel that i am talking about the Government of India
 main india kii nahin media kii aalochana kar rahaa hum
 Do not get confused between i and M
 ek hi maalik ke do channel hai
 There are two anchors in the same channel
 ek sampradayikta failaa rahaa he, ek kisaanon kii baat kar rahaa he
 One is spreading lies, one is talking of broken roads
 sawaal, ham jaise sawaal karne vaale se he, jawaab ham jaison ke paas nahin he
 You ask those who bring the media to you, who bring you to India
 phek news aaj oficial news he
 Reporters in the newsroom have finished
 reporter kaa istemaal hatyare ke rup main hota he
 In a channel, four mps sent five reporters together behind one MP
 dekhne se laga ki sara media uske peeche padaa he
 This is the new era
 daraa hua media apane camaron se aapako daraane niklaa he
 The anchors that are inciting communalism on the channels are getting space
 in ankaron ke paas sarkaar ke liye koi sawaal nahin he, sirf ek hi queshchan sabake paas he
 The name of this question is Hindu Muslim Question, HMQ
 bharat ke news ankar rashtrawaad kii aad main sampradayik ho chuke hai
 To the extent that when the youth in Udaipur climb the roof of the court carrying the saffron flag, the anchors are silent
 kya ham aisa bharat chaahate the, chaahate hai? adaalat jis samvidhan ke tahat he, usee samvidhan kii ek dhara se media apni azaadi kaa charnamrita grahan karata he
 Charanamrit must have understood
 garvanment of media ke paas ek hi agenda he
 Hindu Muslim Question
 isse jude phek news kii itani bharmaar he ki aap alt news dot in par pard sakate hai
 Now fake news has started being made from the other side
 My dear friends, believe me, Media is trying to murder our hard earned democracy
 Our Media is a murderer
 yah samaaj main aisa asantulan paidaa kar rahaa he, apni bahason ke zarie aisa zehar bo rahaa he jisase hamaare loktantr ke bheetar bhay kaa maahaul bana rahe
 Which triggers a rush anytime anywhere and overpowers you
 aap kahenge ki kya itnaa bura he, kuch bhi acha nahin he
 i know you like positive poses from time to time
 ek positive bataata hum
 India's democracy is not bent by the media's bowing down
 vah media ke mit jane se nahin mit jayega
 He neither bowed in emergency nor he would bow during the era of dock media
 bharat kaa loktantr hamaari aatma he
 We have a conscience
 aatma amar he
 You can read the Gita
 main garvanment of media kii baat kar rahaa hum
 Like you, i also dream about India
 magar jaagate hue
 The reality in front of me is a dream
 main ek aise bharat kaa sapana dekhtaa hum jo hakeekat kaa saamana kar sake
 Think about why we are entangled in questions of the past these days
 agar in sawaalon kaa saamana hi karnaa he to kya ham thik se kar rahe hai, kya in sawaalon kaa saamana karne kii jagah tivi kaa studio he? yaa classroom he, conference room hai, or saamana ham kis tarah se karenge, kya ham aaj hisaab karenge, kya ham aaj qatleam karenge? to kya aap apane ghar se ek hatyara dene ke liye taiyaar hai? nafrat kii yah aandhi har ghar main ek hatyara paidaa kar jaaegi, wo aapkaa bhai ho saktaa he, betaa ho saktaa he, dost ho saktaa he, padosi ho saktaa he, kya aapane man bana liya he? kya hamane siikhaa he ki itihaas kaa saamana kaise kiya jaae? ham class room main nahin, sadak or tivi studio main itihaas kaa hisaab karne nikle hai
 You do not change history by making Nehru a Muslim or by defeating Akbar, when history starts to change by the order of the Minister of Education, then understand that he would not have been a good student of the Chemistry
 kya aap yahaan harvard main baithkar is baat ko sweekaar kar sakate hai ki itihaas ke class room main koi mantri aakar itihaas badal de
 Take the book from the professor's hand and give it to read
 kya aap bardaasht karenge? jab aap khud ke liye yah bardaasht nahin kar sakate to bharat ke liye kaise kar sakate hai? There must be a new debate in history, there should be new research
 lekin ham vaisaa kar rahe hai
 We have debated for three months on a film
 itani bahes hamane bharat kii garibi par nahin kii, bharat kii sambhaavnaaon par nahin kii, hamane teen maheene ek film par bahes kii
 People came to the studio with swords, now someday will bring guns
 maharana kii haar ke baad bhi logon ne mahaan vijeta ke rup main sweekaar kiya tha
 His heroic saga had no effect on the defeat which an Education Minister tried to replace with his strength
 lok shrutiyon main aparaajey maharana ke liye kitabon main badi haar he
 i do not think that brave soldiers like Maharana Pratap would have been happy to write victory instead of defeat
 jo vir hota he wo haar ko bhi gale lagaataa he
 But it is true that the public does not understand the history as it is in the class room
 class room main bhi baari asamnata he
 Millions of students of history did not get good books, teachers could not find them, so they took the garbage in place of books
 kooday ko itihaas samaj liya
 Even today, we do not understand history without pride and pride
 sone kii chidiya tha hamaara desh
 The country was the world master
 ye sab visheshan hai, itihaas nahin he
 SUPERLATIVES CANT BE HISTORY
 vaise is teen maheene main bharat me jitne itihaaskaar paidaa hue hai, utane oxford or cambridge apane kai sau saal ke itihaas main paidaa nahin kar paae honge
 In India, you can become a historian just by burning, tearing posters
 kisi film kaa pradarshan rukvaa kar aap itihaaskaar ban sakate hai
 For the historians we have produced in three years, now we do not even have that much diversity
 angrezon kii kalpana thi ki bharat ke itihaas ko hindu itihaas muslim itihaas main badal do
 Today many people are fulfilling the idea of english rule
 wo waapas itihaas ko hindu banaam musalmaan ke khaanche main le ja rahe hai
 To cover the present, issues are being brought from history through which the religious identity of the citizen and voter can be created
 ham kyon apni bhartiyata kabhi anekta main ekta main khojate khojate, dharmik ekarupata main khojane lagate hai? ham samvidhan se apni pahchaan kyon nahin hasil karte, jiske liye hamane sau saal kii ladaai ladi
 Argued day and night, millions of people went to jail
 agar bahuton ko lagata he ki is sawaal par bahes honi chahie to kya ham sahi tareeke se apane sawaal rakh rahe hai, bahes kar rahe hai, kya uskaa manch akhbaar tak na padhane vaale ye ankar honge
 After all, why does the majority religion want to impose religious interpretation on the characters of history? Once our Indianness was found in the media space, my voice was made with yours, today our tone is ours, your note is yours or your tone is nothing, our voice is yours
 ham bharatiyon kaa bhartiya hone kaa bodh or itihaas bodh donon sankat se guzar rahaa he
 We are being prepared with a sense of a fragmented citizenship
 jiske bheetar phek news or phek history ke zarie aisi politicil programing kii ja rahi he ki kisi bhi shahar main chote chote samooh main logon ko trigar kiya ja saktaa he
 Can you avenge history, then you are going against the basic concept of justice which says that blood is not revenge blood
 agar ham khun kaa badla khun kii avadharana par jaaenge to hamaare chaaron taraf hinsa hi hinsa hogi
 There are two types of political identity in India at this time
 ek jo dharmik aakraamakata se las he or doosraa to dharmik aatmavishvaas kho chukaa he
 One is intimidating and frightened
 yah asantulan aane vaale samay main hamaare saamne kai chunautiyaan laane vaala hai jinhen ham koob pahachaanate hai
 We have seen its consequences, we also pay
 alag-alag samay par alag-alag samudaayon ne bhugte hai
 Old wounds are not erased from our memories that we bring new wounds
 jaise hindustan ek tu in van desh he
 Which has been recognized as India and India in our official tongue
 usee tarah hamaari pahchaan dharm or jati ke tu in van par aadhaarit he
 You look at India from these caste organizations, you will not be able to see its face in front of everyone
 aap jati kaa cheharaa chupake se ghar jaakar dekhte hai
 We did not end caste
 hamane azaad bharat main nai nai CAST COLONIES banaai hai
 These belong to CAST COLONIES CONCRETE
 iske mukhiya us aadhunik bharat main paidaa hue log hai
 Ask yourself why these castes are becoming colonies in society today
 aaj kaa matlab 2018 nahin or na hi 2014 he
 We pride India, pride of religion, pride of caste
 ham apane bheetar har tarah kii krurta ko bachaate rahanaa chaahate hai
 Is caste really a matter of pride? If the answer to this question is yes, then we are cheating with the Constitution, betraying the spirit of our national movement
 team india kaa raajnneetik slogan cast india, religen india main badal chukaa he
 a cooperative society of Brahmins has been formed in Andhra Pradesh
 iskaa mishan he brahmanon kii viraasat ko dobaaraa se jivit karnaa or use aage badhanaa
 What is the heritage of Brahmins, what is the heritage of Rajputs? Then what is the problem with Bhima Koregaon, the legacy of Dalits? Then what is the problem with the legacy of the Mughals, where the Israeli head of state also wants to spend two moments with his wife
 aap is sosayadi kii website http: / / www
 apbrahmincoop
 com par jaaiye
 Chief Minister Chandra Babu Naidu is launching its magazine because the head of this society is a member of his party
 is sosayadi ke lakshya vahiin hai jo ek sarkaar ke hone chahie
 Which should be our economic policies
 kya hamaari nitiyaan is kadar fail rahi hai ki ab ham apni apni jatiyon kaa koparative banane lage hai
 Its goal is to form a self-help group of poor Brahmin castes, give them loans to do business, buy cars
 iske sadsy sirf brahman samudaay se ho sakate hai
 There are IAS, professional people
 iske cheiman anand surya bhi brahman hai
 In his introduction, he calls himself a trade union leader and businessman
 duniya main bijanes main shaayad hi trade union netaa banate hai
 He has lived in BJP, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, Janata Dal, Samajwadi Janata Party, Janata Dal Secular
 jahaan unhone siikhaa he ki brahn samudaay ko naitik or raajnneetik samarthan kaise dena he
 We did not know that people in Samajwadi Party also learn all this
 2003 se ve tidipi main hai
 It is not the only such institution
 videshon main bhi or bharat main bhi aise anek jatigat sanghathan kaayam hai
 The political status of their presidents is more than any leader
 is spes ke baahar bina is tarah kii pahchaan ke liye netaa bananaa asambhav he
 In 2013, Vedic Society for Brahmins was started in Bangalore
 sochie ek township he sirf brahmanon kaa
 Where will this exclusion take us, is it not a kind of ghetto? 2700 ghar brahamanon ke alag se honge
 This will become a system of villages again
 brahmanon kaa alag se
 Isn't it ghetto? azaad bharat main yah kyon hua? assi ke dashak main jab houseing sosayadi kaa vistaar hua to use jati or khaas peshey ke aadhaar par basaaya gaya
 There is Patparganj in Delhi, there you will find many housing societies according to caste, occupation, region and state
 to phir ham samvidhan ke aadhaar par bhartiya kaise ban rahe the
 Can we not be an Indian without caste support? jaipur ke vidyanagar main jatiyon ke alag alag hostel bane hai
 Shri Rajput Sabha has built hostels for boys of its caste
 ladakiyon ke bhi hai
 The Yadavas also have separate hostels
 meena jati ke bhi alag chatravaas hai
 Brahmin caste also has separate hostels
 ab aap bataayen, in hostel se nikal jo bhi aage jayega wo apane bheetar kiski pahchaan ko aage rakhega
 Will his identity not clash with Constitution-based Indianness? There is also the Khatik studentship which the government has made
 kyon rajya sarkaron ko daliton ke liye alag se hostel banane kii zarurat padi? kya hamaari jatiyon ke oonche tabake ne samvidhan ke aadhaar par bharat ko abhi tak sweekaar nahin kiya he, kya vah samvidhan aadhaarit naagarikta ko pasand nahin karata he? kya jatiyon ko koi aisa samooh he jo dharm ke sahare apana varchasv phir se hasil karnaa chahta he? kya koi aisa bhi samooh he jo ab pehle se kai guna zyaada takat se is varchasv ko chunauti de rahaa he?tippaniyan Like India's politics, the media also comes from these cast colonies
 uske sampadak bhi isi cast colony se aate hai
 They do not like the identity of caste in public but they like the identity of religion
 isliye ve dharm kii pahchaan ke zarie jati kii pahchaan thel rahe hai
 This work can only be done by those who do not believe in democracy because caste is against democracy
 garvanment of media main sab kuch thik nahin he
 The positive is that it is speaking freely against democracy
 bhaichaare ke kilaaf puri azaadi se bol rahaa he
 Our Government of Media is free
 pehle se kahin azaad he
 i am ending my speech on this positive note
 kul milakar ham yathasthiti ko pramot kar rahe hai
 We are calling the pride of religion a nation
 aap chahen to darwin ko riject kar sakate hai
 If you want, you can declare Ganesh Pooja as a medical college

 jab 2ji ke aaropee bari hue, sibiai saboot pesh nahin kar pai tab maine pehali baar dekha, kisi kitaab ko cover ko chhipate hue
 You have seen this happen
 lagata he ki kitaab kah rahi he ki ye baat sahi nikali ki ye sirf accountint nahin hai, magar ye baat jhooth he ki ve neshans ke kanshiens keeper hai
 i am scared of that power when a scared media puts the headline of Super Power India
 main chahta hum ki vishwa guru banane se pehle kam se kam un collejon main guru pahunch jaaen, jahaan 8500 ladkiyaan padhati hai magar padhaane ke liye 9 teacher hai
 Then you will say if nothing good is happening
 kya yah acha nahin he ki bina teacher ke bhi hamaari ladkiyaan bie paas kar ja rahi hai
 Can you do this in Howard? Can show in Cambridge, show in Oxford, can you do it in Yale and Columbia? media ne india ke basic queshchan ko chhod diya he
 So i said that coming from so far, i will talk about the Government of Media so that you do not feel that i am talking about the Government of India
 main india kii nahin media kii aalochana kar rahaa hum
 Do not get confused between i and M
 ek hi maalik ke do channel hai
 There are two anchors in the same channel
 ek sampradayikta failaa rahaa he, ek kisaanon kii baat kar rahaa he
 One is spreading lies, one is talking of broken roads
 sawaal, ham jaise sawaal karne vaale se he, jawaab ham jaison ke paas nahin he
 You ask those who bring the media to you, who bring you to India
 phek news aaj oficial news he
 Reporters in the newsroom have finished
 reporter kaa istemaal hatyare ke rup main hota he
 In a channel, four mps sent five reporters together behind one MP
 dekhne se laga ki sara media uske peeche padaa he
 This is the new era
 daraa hua media apane camaron se aapako daraane niklaa he
 The anchors that are inciting communalism on the channels are getting space
 in ankaron ke paas sarkaar ke liye koi sawaal nahin he, sirf ek hi queshchan sabake paas he
 The name of this question is Hindu Muslim Question, HMQ
 bharat ke news ankar rashtrawaad kii aad main sampradayik ho chuke hai
 To the extent that when the youth in Udaipur climb the roof of the court carrying the saffron flag, the anchors are silent
 kya ham aisa bharat chaahate the, chaahate hai? adaalat jis samvidhan ke tahat he, usee samvidhan kii ek dhara se media apni azaadi kaa charnamrita grahan karata he
 Charanamrit must have understood
 garvanment of media ke paas ek hi agenda he
 Hindu Muslim Question
 isse jude phek news kii itani bharmaar he ki aap alt news dot in par pard sakate hai
 Now fake news has started being made from the other side
 My dear friends, believe me, Media is trying to murder our hard earned democracy
 Our Media is a murderer
 yah samaaj main aisa asantulan paidaa kar rahaa he, apni bahason ke zarie aisa zehar bo rahaa he jisase hamaare loktantr ke bheetar bhay kaa maahaul bana rahe
 Which triggers a rush anytime anywhere and overpowers you
 aap kahenge ki kya itnaa bura he, kuch bhi acha nahin he
 i know you like positive poses from time to time
 ek positive bataata hum
 India's democracy is not bent by the media's bowing down
 vah media ke mit jane se nahin mit jayega
 He neither bowed in emergency nor he would bow during the era of dock media
 bharat kaa loktantr hamaari aatma he
 We have a conscience
 aatma amar he
 You can read the Gita
 main garvanment of media kii baat kar rahaa hum
 Like you, i also dream about India
 magar jaagate hue
 The reality in front of me is a dream
 main ek aise bharat kaa sapana dekhtaa hum jo hakeekat kaa saamana kar sake
 Think about why we are entangled in questions of the past these days
 agar in sawaalon kaa saamana hi karnaa he to kya ham thik se kar rahe hai, kya in sawaalon kaa saamana karne kii jagah tivi kaa studio he? yaa classroom he, conference room hai, or saamana ham kis tarah se karenge, kya ham aaj hisaab karenge, kya ham aaj qatleam karenge? to kya aap apane ghar se ek hatyara dene ke liye taiyaar hai? nafrat kii yah aandhi har ghar main ek hatyara paidaa kar jaaegi, wo aapkaa bhai ho saktaa he, betaa ho saktaa he, dost ho saktaa he, padosi ho saktaa he, kya aapane man bana liya he? kya hamane siikhaa he ki itihaas kaa saamana kaise kiya jaae? ham class room main nahin, sadak or tivi studio main itihaas kaa hisaab karne nikle hai
 You do not change history by making Nehru a Muslim or by defeating Akbar, when history starts to change by the order of the Minister of Education, then understand that he would not have been a good student of the Chemistry
 kya aap yahaan harvard main baithkar is baat ko sweekaar kar sakate hai ki itihaas ke class room main koi mantri aakar itihaas badal de
 Take the book from the professor's hand and give it to read
 kya aap bardaasht karenge? jab aap khud ke liye yah bardaasht nahin kar sakate to bharat ke liye kaise kar sakate hai? There must be a new debate in history, there should be new research
 lekin ham vaisaa kar rahe hai
 We have debated for three months on a film
 itani bahes hamane bharat kii garibi par nahin kii, bharat kii sambhaavnaaon par nahin kii, hamane teen maheene ek film par bahes kii
 People came to the studio with swords, now someday will bring guns
 maharana kii haar ke baad bhi logon ne mahaan vijeta ke rup main sweekaar kiya tha
 His heroic saga had no effect on the defeat which an Education Minister tried to replace with his strength
 lok shrutiyon main aparaajey maharana ke liye kitabon main badi haar he
 i do not think that brave soldiers like Maharana Pratap would have been happy to write victory instead of defeat
 jo vir hota he wo haar ko bhi gale lagaataa he
 But it is true that the public does not understand the history as it is in the class room
 class room main bhi baari asamnata he
 Millions of students of history did not get good books, teachers could not find them, so they took the garbage in place of books
 kooday ko itihaas samaj liya
 Even today, we do not understand history without pride and pride
 sone kii chidiya tha hamaara desh
 The country was the world master
 ye sab visheshan hai, itihaas nahin he
 SUPERLATIVES CANT BE HISTORY
 vaise is teen maheene main bharat me jitne itihaaskaar paidaa hue hai, utane oxford or cambridge apane kai sau saal ke itihaas main paidaa nahin kar paae honge
 In India, you can become a historian just by burning, tearing posters
 kisi film kaa pradarshan rukvaa kar aap itihaaskaar ban sakate hai
 For the historians we have produced in three years, now we do not even have that much diversity
 angrezon kii kalpana thi ki bharat ke itihaas ko hindu itihaas muslim itihaas main badal do
 Today many people are fulfilling the idea of english rule
 wo waapas itihaas ko hindu banaam musalmaan ke khaanche main le ja rahe hai
 To cover the present, issues are being brought from history through which the religious identity of the citizen and voter can be created
 ham kyon apni bhartiyata kabhi anekta main ekta main khojate khojate, dharmik ekarupata main khojane lagate hai? ham samvidhan se apni pahchaan kyon nahin hasil karte, jiske liye hamane sau saal kii ladaai ladi
 Argued day and night, millions of people went to jail
 agar bahuton ko lagata he ki is sawaal par bahes honi chahie to kya ham sahi tareeke se apane sawaal rakh rahe hai, bahes kar rahe hai, kya uskaa manch akhbaar tak na padhane vaale ye ankar honge
 After all, why does the majority religion want to impose religious interpretation on the characters of history? Once our Indianness was found in the media space, my voice was made with yours, today our tone is ours, your note is yours or your tone is nothing, our voice is yours
 ham bharatiyon kaa bhartiya hone kaa bodh or itihaas bodh donon sankat se guzar rahaa he
 We are being prepared with a sense of a fragmented citizenship
 jiske bheetar phek news or phek history ke zarie aisi politicil programing kii ja rahi he ki kisi bhi shahar main chote chote samooh main logon ko trigar kiya ja saktaa he
 Can you avenge history, then you are going against the basic concept of justice which says that blood is not revenge blood
 agar ham khun kaa badla khun kii avadharana par jaaenge to hamaare chaaron taraf hinsa hi hinsa hogi
 There are two types of political identity in India at this time
 ek jo dharmik aakraamakata se las he or doosraa to dharmik aatmavishvaas kho chukaa he
 One is intimidating and frightened
 yah asantulan aane vaale samay main hamaare saamne kai chunautiyaan laane vaala hai jinhen ham koob pahachaanate hai
 We have seen its consequences, we also pay
 alag-alag samay par alag-alag samudaayon ne bhugte hai
 Old wounds are not erased from our memories that we bring new wounds
 jaise hindustan ek tu in van desh he
 Which has been recognized as India and India in our official tongue
 usee tarah hamaari pahchaan dharm or jati ke tu in van par aadhaarit he
 You look at India from these caste organizations, you will not be able to see its face in front of everyone
 aap jati kaa cheharaa chupake se ghar jaakar dekhte hai
 We did not end caste
 hamane azaad bharat main nai nai CAST COLONIES banaai hai
 These belong to CAST COLONIES CONCRETE
 iske mukhiya us aadhunik bharat main paidaa hue log hai
 Ask yourself why these castes are becoming colonies in society today
 aaj kaa matlab 2018 nahin or na hi 2014 he
 We pride India, pride of religion, pride of caste
 ham apane bheetar har tarah kii krurta ko bachaate rahanaa chaahate hai
 Is caste really a matter of pride? If the answer to this question is yes, then we are cheating with the Constitution, betraying the spirit of our national movement
 team india kaa raajnneetik slogan cast india, religen india main badal chukaa he
 a cooperative society of Brahmins has been formed in Andhra Pradesh
 iskaa mishan he brahmanon kii viraasat ko dobaaraa se jivit karnaa or use aage badhanaa
 What is the heritage of Brahmins, what is the heritage of Rajputs? Then what is the problem with Bhima Koregaon, the legacy of Dalits? Then what is the problem with the legacy of the Mughals, where the Israeli head of state also wants to spend two moments with his wife
 aap is sosayadi kii website http: / / www
 apbrahmincoop
 com par jaaiye
 Chief Minister Chandra Babu Naidu is launching its magazine because the head of this society is a member of his party
 is sosayadi ke lakshya vahiin hai jo ek sarkaar ke hone chahie
 Which should be our economic policies
 kya hamaari nitiyaan is kadar fail rahi hai ki ab ham apni apni jatiyon kaa koparative banane lage hai
 Its goal is to form a self-help group of poor Brahmin castes, give them loans to do business, buy cars
 iske sadsy sirf brahman samudaay se ho sakate hai
 There are IAS, professional people
 iske cheiman anand surya bhi brahman hai
 In his introduction, he calls himself a trade union leader and businessman
 duniya main bijanes main shaayad hi trade union netaa banate hai
 He has lived in BJP, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, Janata Dal, Samajwadi Janata Party, Janata Dal Secular
 jahaan unhone siikhaa he ki brahn samudaay ko naitik or raajnneetik samarthan kaise dena he
 We did not know that people in Samajwadi Party also learn all this
 2003 se ve tidipi main hai
 It is not the only such institution
 videshon main bhi or bharat main bhi aise anek jatigat sanghathan kaayam hai
 The political status of their presidents is more than any leader
 is spes ke baahar bina is tarah kii pahchaan ke liye netaa bananaa asambhav he
 In 2013, Vedic Society for Brahmins was started in Bangalore
 sochie ek township he sirf brahmanon kaa
 Where will this exclusion take us, is it not a kind of ghetto? 2700 ghar brahamanon ke alag se honge
 This will become a system of villages again
 brahmanon kaa alag se
 Isn't it ghetto? azaad bharat main yah kyon hua? assi ke dashak main jab houseing sosayadi kaa vistaar hua to use jati or khaas peshey ke aadhaar par basaaya gaya
 There is Patparganj in Delhi, there you will find many housing societies according to caste, occupation, region and state
 to phir ham samvidhan ke aadhaar par bhartiya kaise ban rahe the
 Can we not be an Indian without caste support? jaipur ke vidyanagar main jatiyon ke alag alag hostel bane hai
 Shri Rajput Sabha has built hostels for boys of its caste
 ladakiyon ke bhi hai
 The Yadavas also have separate hostels
 meena jati ke bhi alag chatravaas hai
 Brahmin caste also has separate hostels
 ab aap bataayen, in hostel se nikal jo bhi aage jayega wo apane bheetar kiski pahchaan ko aage rakhega
 Will his identity not clash with Constitution-based Indianness? There is also the Khatik studentship which the government has made
 kyon rajya sarkaron ko daliton ke liye alag se hostel banane kii zarurat padi? kya hamaari jatiyon ke oonche tabake ne samvidhan ke aadhaar par bharat ko abhi tak sweekaar nahin kiya he, kya vah samvidhan aadhaarit naagarikta ko pasand nahin karata he? kya jatiyon ko koi aisa samooh he jo dharm ke sahare apana varchasv phir se hasil karnaa chahta he? kya koi aisa bhi samooh he jo ab pehle se kai guna zyaada takat se is varchasv ko chunauti de rahaa he?tippaniyan Like India's politics, the media also comes from these cast colonies
 uske sampadak bhi isi cast colony se aate hai
 They do not like the identity of caste in public but they like the identity of religion
 isliye ve dharm kii pahchaan ke zarie jati kii pahchaan thel rahe hai
 This work can only be done by those who do not believe in democracy because caste is against democracy
 garvanment of media main sab kuch thik nahin he
 The positive is that it is speaking freely against democracy
 bhaichaare ke kilaaf puri azaadi se bol rahaa he
 Our Government of Media is free
 pehle se kahin azaad he
 i am ending my speech on this positive note
 kul milakar ham yathasthiti ko pramot kar rahe hai
 We are calling the pride of religion a nation
 aap chahen to darwin ko riject kar sakate hai
 If you want, you can declare Ganesh Pooja as a medical college
 ek ko janata ne chunaa he or duusare ne khud ko sarkaar ke liye chun liya he
 One is elected by vote and one is rated
 yahaan america main media he, bharat main godi media he
 i do not want to prolong my speech by giving one example, nor do i intend to embarrass you
 garvanment of media main bahut kuch acha he
 Like weather news
 accident kii khabaren
 Saina and Sindhu win, Dangal being a super hit
 aisa nahin he ki kuch bhi acha nahin he
 Millions of young men are standing in line for 14 posts of peons, who says there is hope
 collejon main chah chah saal main bie karne vaale lakhon noujvaan intazaar kar rahe hai, koun kahata he ki ummid nahin bachi he
 There is only hope that these young men are left behind
 ek daraa hua patrkaar loktantr main mara hua naagarik paidaa karata he
 a scared journalist becomes your hero, that means you have given fear to your home
 is vakt bharat ke loktantr ko bharat ke media se khatara he
 India's TV media has turned against democracy
 bharat kaa print media chupchaap us qatl main shaamil he jisamen bahata hua koon to nahin dikhataa he, magar idhar-udhar kone main chhaapi ja rahi kuch kaam kii khabaron main qatl kii aah sunai de jaati he
 The death of CBI court judge BH Loya is proof of who the Indian media is with
 kairavaan patrika kii report aane ke baad dilli ke ankar aasmaan kii taraf dekhne lage or hawaaon main nami kii maatra vaali khabaren padhane lage the
 Even opposition parties have become victims of this fear
 unke netaaon ko badi der baad himmat ai ki jaj loya kii maut ke sawaalon kii jaanch kii maang kii jaae
 When the courage came, the bench of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was hearing the case of Judge Loya
 iske baad bhi congress party ne jab jaj loya se sambandhit purv jajon kii maut par sawaal uthaaya to use dilli ke akhbaaron ne nahin chapa, channelon ne nahin dikhaaya
 It is not that the Government of Media forgot to ask questions
 usne rahul gandhi ke star vars dekhne par kitna bada sawaal kiya tha
 You can say that the Government of India wants Sirius to be the Leader of the Opposition
 lekin jab vah netaa sirius hokar jaj loya ko lekar press conference kar detaa he to media apana siriyasnes bhul jaataa he
 Remember friends, i am talking about the Government of Media, not the Government of India abroad
 media main kya koi khud se dar gaya he yaa kisi ke daraane se dar gaya he, yah ek khulaa prashn he
 Fear has nothing to do with DNA, anyone can be afraid, especially in a fake case and hanging lawsuits for many years where it is easy, fear is part of the system
 dar natural he
 Gandhi went to jail and freed us from the fear of jail
 ghulaam bharat ke garib se garib or anpadh se anpadh log jail ke dar se azaad ho gaye
 There was a scam of 2 lakh crores in 2G, but when the accused are acquitted, they have not been able to speak till date
 jinaki kitaab kaa naam he NOT JUST AN ACCOUNTANT, THE DIARY OF NATIONS CONSCIENCE KEEPER
 When the 2G accused were acquitted, the CBI was unable to produce evidence when i first saw it, while hiding the cover of a book
 aapane dekha he aisa hote hue
 It seems that the book is saying that it turned out to be true that they are not just accountants, but it is a lie that they are the conscience keeper of the nations
 ek daraa hua media jab super power india kaa hedline lagaataa he tab mujhe us power se dar lagata he
 i want Guru to reach at least those colleges where 8500 girls study but 9 teachers to teach before becoming a world teacher
 phir aap kahenge ki kya kuch bhi acha nahin ho rahaa he
 Is it not good that our girls are passing BA even without teachers? kya aap aisa harvard main karke dikhaa sakate hai? cambridge main dikhaa sakate hai, oxford main dikhaa sakate hai, kya aap yel or colombia main aisa karke dikhaa sakate hai? Media has left the basic question of India
 isliye maine kaha ki itani dur se aakar main garvanment of media kii baat karuunga taaki aapako na lage ki main garvanment of india kii baat kar rahaa hum
 i am criticizing the media, not India
 aap i or m main kanfus mat kar janaa
 There are two channels of the same owner
 ek hi channel main do ankar hai
 One is spreading communalism, one is talking of farmers
 ek jhooth failaa rahaa he, ek tuuti sadakon kii baat kar rahaa he
 The question is from the questioner like us, like we do not have the answer
 aap unase puuchhie jo aap tak media ko lekar aate hai, jo aap tak india lekar aate hai
 Fake News is official news today
 news room main reporter samaapt ho chuke hai
 The reporter is used as a murderer
 ek channel main ek saansad ke pich chaar paanch reporter ek saath bhej diya
 It was seen that all the media was behind him
 yah nayaa daur he
 Scared media has come to scare you with its cameras
 channelon par sampradayikta bhadakaane vaale ankaron ko jagah mil rahi he
 These anchors have no question for the government, only one question is with everyone
 is sawaal kaa naam he hindu muslim queshchan, HMQ
 India's news anchors have become communal under the guise of nationalism
 is had tak ki jab udaipur main noujvaan bhagava jhanda lekar adaalat kii chat par chadh jate hai to ankar chup ho gaye hai
 Did we want such an India, want it? The constitution under which the court is under the same constitution, the media assumes the phase of its independence
 charnamrita to samajhate honge
 The Government of Media has the same agenda
 hindu muslim queshchan
 There is so much of fake news related to it that you can read on Alt News
com
 ab to phek news duusari taraf se banane lage hai
 My dear friends, believe me, media is trying to murder our hard earned democracy
 Our Media is a murderer
 It is creating such an imbalance in the society, through its debates, is poisoning such a poison that creates an atmosphere of fear within our democracy
 jisase ek bheed kabhi bhi kahin bhi trigar ho jaati he or aapako overpavar kar detii he
 You would say what is so bad, nothing is good
 mujhe pataa he ki aapako bich bich main positive acha lagata he
 i will tell you a positive bharat kaa loktantr media ke jhuk jane se nahin jhuk jaataa he
 It will not disappear as media is lost
 vah na to apatkaal main jhukaa na vah godi media ke kaal main jhukegaa
 The democracy of India is our soul
 hamaara zamir he
 The soul is immortal
 aap gita pard sakate hai
 i am talking about the Government of Media
 aapaki tarah main bhi bharat ko lekar sapane dekhtaa hum
 But while awake saamne kii hakeekat hi mere liye sapana he
 i dream of an India that can face reality
 sochie zaraa ham aaj kal ateet ke sawaalon me kyon uljhe hai
 If we have to face these questions, then are we doing properly, is there a TV studio instead of facing these questions? Or is it a classroom, a conference room, and how will we face it, will we calculate today, will we commit murder today? So are you ready to deliver a killer from your home? This storm of hate will create a killer in every house, it can be your brother, can be a son, can be a friend, can be a neighbor, have you made up your mind? Have we learned how to face history? We are out in the class room, not in the street and TV studios to calculate history
 nehru ko musalmaan bana dene se yaa akbar ko parajeet bana dene se aap itihaas nahin badal dete, itihaas jab shiksha mantri ke aadesh se badalane lage to samajhie ki vah mantri chemistry kaa bhi acha vidhyaarthee nahin rahaa hoga
 Can you accept sitting here at Harvard and change the history by having a minister come to the class room of history
 professor ke haath se kitaab lekar, apni kitaab padhane ke liye de de
 Will you tolerate How can you do it for India when you can't afford it for yourself? zarur itihaas main nai bahes chalani chahie, nae shodh hone chahie
 But we are doing so
 ek film par hamane teen maheene bahes kii he
 We did not debate so much on India's poverty, did not debate India's prospects, we debated a film for three months
 talavaarein lekar log studio main aa gaye, ab kisi din bandooken lekar aaenge
 Even after the defeat of Maharana, people were accepted as great conquerors
 unki veerta kii gaatha par us haar kaa koi asar hi nahin tha, jise ek shiksha mantri ne apni takat se badalane kii koshish kii
 There is a big defeat in books for the unbeatable Maharana in folk legends
 mujhe nahin lagata ki maharana pratap jaise bahadur kaagaz par haar kii jagah jeet likh dene se khush hote
 The one who is brave also embraces defeat
 par yah sahi he ki public main itihaas ko lekar waisi samaj nahin he jaisi class room main he
 There is heavy disharmony in the class room as well
 itihaas ke lakhon chaatro ko acchhee kitaaben nahin milin, shikshak nahin mili isliye sabane kitaab kii jagah kooda uthaa liya
 Litter understood history
 ham aaj bhi itihaas ko gaurav gaan or gaurav bhav ke bina nahin samaj pate hai
 The gold bird was our country
 vishwa guru tha desh
 These are all adjectives, not history
 SUPERLATIVES CANT BE HISTORY
 However, the number of historians born in India in this three months, Oxford and Cambridge could not have been born in their history of several hundred years
 bharat main aap bas jalaakar, poster fadkar itihaaskaar ban sakate hai
 You can become a historian by stopping the performance of a film
 teen saal main hamane jinte itihaaskaar paidaa kiye hai, unke liye ab hamaare paas utani universti bhi nahin hai
 It was the imagination of the British to convert the history of India to Hindu history into Muslim history
 aaj bahut se log angrezi hukumat kii soch ko puraa kar rahe hai
 They are taking history back into the mold of Hindu versus Muslim
 vartmaan par pardaa daalane ke liye itihaas se vaise mudde laae ja rahe hai jinke zarie naagarik kaa, matadaata kaa dharmik pahchaan banaai ja sake
 Why do we ever seek our Indianness in unity in diversity, in religious uniformity? Why don't we get our identity from the Constitution, for which we fought for a hundred years
 din raat bahes kiye, lakhon log jail gaye
 If many feel that this question should be debated, are we rightly placing our questions, arguing, will these forums be the anchors not reading the newspaper
 akhir kyon bahusankhyak dharm itihaas ke kirdaaron par dharmik vyakhya thopanaa chahta he? kabhi media ke spes main hamaari bhartiyata mili sur meraa tumhaara se banati thi, aaj hamaara sur hamaara, tumhaara sur tumhaara yaa tumhaara sur kuch nahin, hamaara hi sur tumhaara
 We Indians are going through both a crisis and a sense of being an Indian
 hamen ek khandit naagarikta ke bodh ke saath taiyaar kiye ja rahe hai
 Within which such political programming is being done through fake news and fake history that people can be triggered in small groups in any city
 kya aap itihaas kaa badla le sakate hai to phir aap nyaay kii mul avadharana ke khilaaf ja rahe hai jo kahata he ki khun kaa badla khun nahin hota he
 If we go to the concept of blood revenge, then violence will be violence all around us
 is samay bharat main do tarah ke polytical aaidentity hai
 One who is armed with religious aggression and the other has lost religious confidence
 ek daraane vaala he or daraa hua he
 This imbalance is going to bring many challenges in front of us which we recognize very well
 hamane iske nattejey dekhe hai, bhugte bhi hai
 Different communities pay at different times
 hamaari smritiyon se puraane zakhm mitate bhi nahin ki ham nae zakhm le aate hai
 Like India is a two in one country
 jise hamaari sarkari jubaan main india or bharat ke rup main pahchaan mil chuki he
 In the same way, our identity is based on two in one religion and caste
 aap in jati sanghathanon kii taraf se bharat ko dekhie, aap uskaa cheharaa sabake saamne dekh nahin paaenge
 You see the face of the caste secretly at home
 hamane jati ko khatm nahin kiya
 We have created new new CAST COLONIES in free India
 ye CAST COLONIES CONCRETE kii hai
 Its head is a people born in that modern India
 puuchhie khud se ki aaj kyon samaaj main ye jati coloni ban rahi hai
 Today does not mean 2018 nor 2014
 ham bharat kaa gaurav karte hai, dharm kaa gaurav karte hai, jati kaa gaurav karte hai
 We want to save all the cruelty within us
 kya jati vaaki gaurav karne kii chiz he? is sawaal kaa jawaab agar haa he to ham samvidhan ke saath dhokhaa kar rahe hai, apane rashtriya andolan kii bhaavana ke saath dhokhaa kar rahe hai
 The political slogan of Team India has changed to Cast India, Religion India
 andhra pradesh main brahn jati kii ek koparative sosayadi bani he
 Its mission is to revive and carry forward the legacy of Brahmins
 brahmanon kii viraasat kya he, rajputon kii viraasat kya he? to phir daliton kii viraasat bhima koregaanv se kya dikkat he? phir mughalon kii viraasat se kya dikkat he jahaan israel ke raashtra pramukh bhi apni patni ke saath do pal guzaarana chaahate hai
 You can visit the Society's website http: / / www

 mukhyamantri chandra babu naidu isaki patrika laanch kar rahe hai kyonki is sosayadi kaa mukhiya unki party kaa sadsy he
 The goals of this society are what the government should have
 jo hamaari aarthik nitiyon ke hone chahie
 Are our policies failing so much that now we have started making our own castes cooperative
 iskaa lakshya he garib brahman jatiyon kaa self helf group bananaa, unhen bijness karne, gaadi kharidne kaa lone dena
 Its members can only be from the Brahmin community
 iees hai, peshewar log hai
 Its chairman Anand Surya is also a Brahmin
 apana parichay main khud ko trade union netaa or bijnesaman likhte hai
 Business men rarely become trade union leaders in the world
 ve bijepi, bhartiya mazdoor sangh, janata dal, samaajawaadee janata party, janata dal secular main rah chuke hai
 Where he has learned how to give moral and political support to the Brahmin community
 hamen pataa hi nahin tha samaajawaadee party main log ye sab bhi sikhte hai
 He has been in TDP since 2003
 yah akelaa aisa santhaan nahin he
 Many such caste organizations are established in foreign countries as well as in India
 inke adhyakshon kii raajnneetik haisiyat kisi netaa se adhik he
 Without this space it is impossible to become a leader without such identification
 bangaloru main to 2013 main sirf brahmanon ke liye vaidic sosayadi banani shuru ho gai thi
 Think a township is only of Brahmins
 ye excluzan hamen kahaan le jayega, kya yah ek tarah kaa gheto nahin he
 2700 houses will be separate from Brahmins
 ye to phir se gaanvon vaala system ho jayega
 Of Brahmins separately
 kya yah gheto nahin he? Why did this happen in free India? When the housing society expanded in the eighties, it was settled on the basis of caste and particular profession
 dilli main patpadganj he, vahaan par jati, pesha, ilaaka or rajya ke hisaab se kai houseing sosayadi aapako milegi
 Then how were we becoming Indians based on the Constitution
 kya bina jati ke samarthan ke ham bhartiya nahin ho sakate
 There are different hostels of castes in Vidyanagar, Jaipur
 shri rajput sabha ne apni jati ke ladakon ke liye hostel banaae hai
 They also have girls
 yadavon ke bhi alag hostel hai
 Meena caste also has separate hostels
 brahman jati ke bhi alag hostel hai
 Now you tell me, whoever goes beyond these hostels will put forward their identity within themselves
 kya uski pahchaan kaa samvidhan aadhaarit bhartiyata se takaraav nahin hoga? khatic chatrawas bhi he jo sarkaar ne banaae hai
 Why did state governments need to create separate hostels for Dalits? Has the upper strata of our castes not yet accepted India on the basis of the constitution, does it not like constitution-based citizenship? Is there any group of castes that want to regain their supremacy with the help of religion? Is there any group that is now challenging this domination with many times more power than before? bharat kii raajnneeti kii tarah media bhi inhen cast colony se aata he
 Its editors also come from the same cast colony
 unhen public main jati kii pahchaan thik nahin lagati magar unhen dharm kii pahchaan thik lagati he
 That is why they are promoting the identity of caste through the identity of religion
 yah kaam vahi kar saktaa he jo loktantr main yakeen nahin rakhata ho kyonki jati loktantr ke kilaaf he
 All is not well in the Government of Media
 positive yahi he ki loktantr ke kilaaf yah puri azaadi se bol rahaa he
 Is speaking freely against brotherhood
 hamaari garvanment of media azaad he
 Free than ever
 isi positive note par main apana bhaashan samaapt kar rahaa hum
 Overall, we are promoting the status quo
 dharm ke gaurav ko ham raashtra bataa rahe hai
 If you wish, you can reject Darwin
 aap chahen to ganesh puja ko hi medical college kii padhai ghoshit kar sakate hai
 a scared journalist produces a dead citizen in a democracy
 ek daraa hua patrkaar aapkaa hero ban jaae, iskaa matlab aapane dar ko apana ghar de diya he
 At this time, India's democracy is threatened by the media of India
 bharat kaa tivi media loktantr ke kilaaf ho gaya he
 The print media of India is quietly involved in a murder that does not see a flowing blood, but some of the work being printed in the corner is heard in the news of murder
 sibiai court ke jaj bi ech loya kii maut is baat kaa pramaan he ki bharat kaa media kiske saath he
 After the report of Caravan magazine, the anchors of Delhi started looking at the sky and reading the news of moisture content in the winds
 yahaan tak ki is dar kaa shikaar vipakshi partiyaan bhi ho gayi hai
 Their leaders dared after a long time to demand an inquiry into the questions of Judge Loya's death
 jab himmat ai tab supreme court ke chif justise kii bench jaj loya ke maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi thi
 Even after this, when the Congress party questioned the death of former judges related to Judge Loya, it was not published by the newspapers in Delhi, the channels did not show
 aisa nahin he ki garvanment of media sawaal karnaa bhul gaya
 How big a question did he ask on watching Rahul Gandhi's Star Wars
 aap kah sakate hai ki garvanment of india chaahati he ki vipaksh kaa netaa sirius rahe
 But when the leader confronts Sirius and holds a press conference about Judge Loya, the media forgets its Sirius
 doston yaad rakhana main garvanment of media kii baat kar rahaa hum, videsh main garvanment of india kii baat nahin kar rahaa hum
 In the media, is anyone scared of himself or scared of scaring someone, it is an open question
 dar kaa diene se koi lenaa dena nahin he, koi bhi dar saktaa he, khaaskar farzi cese main fansaana or kai saal tak mukademon ko latakaana jahaan aasaan ho, vahaan dar system kaa part he
 Fear is natural
 gandhi ne jail jaakar hamen jail ke dar se azaad kara diya
 Slave The poor of the poor and the illiterate from the poor and the illiterate of India were freed from the fear of jail
 2ji main do lakh karod kaa ghotaalaa hua tha, magar jab iske aaropee bari ho gaye to wo janaab aaj tak nahin bol paae hai
 Whose book is named NOT JUST AN ACCOUNTANT, THE DIARY OF NATIONS CONSCIENCE KEEPER
 jab 2ji ke aaropee bari hue, sibiai saboot pesh nahin kar pai tab maine pehali baar dekha, kisi kitaab ko cover ko chhipate hue
 You have seen this happen
 lagata he ki kitaab kah rahi he ki ye baat sahi nikali ki ye sirf accountint nahin hai, magar ye baat jhooth he ki ve neshans ke kanshiens keeper hai
 i am scared of that power when a scared media puts the headline of Super Power India
 main chahta hum ki vishwa guru banane se pehle kam se kam un collejon main guru pahunch jaaen, jahaan 8500 ladkiyaan padhati hai magar padhaane ke liye 9 teacher hai
 Then you will say if nothing good is happening
 kya yah acha nahin he ki bina teacher ke bhi hamaari ladkiyaan bie paas kar ja rahi hai
 Can you do this in Howard? Can show in Cambridge, show in Oxford, can you do it in Yale and Columbia? media ne india ke basic queshchan ko chhod diya he
 So i said that coming from so far, i will talk about the Government of Media so that you do not feel that i am talking about the Government of India
 main india kii nahin media kii aalochana kar rahaa hum
 Do not get confused between i and M
 ek hi maalik ke do channel hai
 There are two anchors in the same channel
 ek sampradayikta failaa rahaa he, ek kisaanon kii baat kar rahaa he
 One is spreading lies, one is talking of broken roads
 sawaal, ham jaise sawaal karne vaale se he, jawaab ham jaison ke paas nahin he
 You ask those who bring the media to you, who bring you to India
 phek news aaj oficial news he
 Reporters in the newsroom have finished
 reporter kaa istemaal hatyare ke rup main hota he
 In a channel, four mps sent five reporters together behind one MP
 dekhne se laga ki sara media uske peeche padaa he
 This is the new era
 daraa hua media apane camaron se aapako daraane niklaa he
 The anchors that are inciting communalism on the channels are getting space
 in ankaron ke paas sarkaar ke liye koi sawaal nahin he, sirf ek hi queshchan sabake paas he
 The name of this question is Hindu Muslim Question, HMQ
 bharat ke news ankar rashtrawaad kii aad main sampradayik ho chuke hai
 To the extent that when the youth in Udaipur climb the roof of the court carrying the saffron flag, the anchors are silent
 kya ham aisa bharat chaahate the, chaahate hai? adaalat jis samvidhan ke tahat he, usee samvidhan kii ek dhara se media apni azaadi kaa charnamrita grahan karata he
 Charanamrit must have understood
 garvanment of media ke paas ek hi agenda he
 Hindu Muslim Question
 isse jude phek news kii itani bharmaar he ki aap alt news dot in par pard sakate hai
 Now fake news has started being made from the other side
 My dear friends, believe me, Media is trying to murder our hard earned democracy
 Our Media is a murderer
 yah samaaj main aisa asantulan paidaa kar rahaa he, apni bahason ke zarie aisa zehar bo rahaa he jisase hamaare loktantr ke bheetar bhay kaa maahaul bana rahe
 Which triggers a rush anytime anywhere and overpowers you
 aap kahenge ki kya itnaa bura he, kuch bhi acha nahin he
 i know you like positive poses from time to time
 ek positive bataata hum
 India's democracy is not bent by the media's bowing down
 vah media ke mit jane se nahin mit jayega
 He neither bowed in emergency nor he would bow during the era of dock media
 bharat kaa loktantr hamaari aatma he
 We have a conscience
 aatma amar he
 You can read the Gita
 main garvanment of media kii baat kar rahaa hum
 Like you, i also dream about India
 magar jaagate hue
 The reality in front of me is a dream
 main ek aise bharat kaa sapana dekhtaa hum jo hakeekat kaa saamana kar sake
 Think about why we are entangled in questions of the past these days
 agar in sawaalon kaa saamana hi karnaa he to kya ham thik se kar rahe hai, kya in sawaalon kaa saamana karne kii jagah tivi kaa studio he? yaa classroom he, conference room hai, or saamana ham kis tarah se karenge, kya ham aaj hisaab karenge, kya ham aaj qatleam karenge? to kya aap apane ghar se ek hatyara dene ke liye taiyaar hai? nafrat kii yah aandhi har ghar main ek hatyara paidaa kar jaaegi, wo aapkaa bhai ho saktaa he, betaa ho saktaa he, dost ho saktaa he, padosi ho saktaa he, kya aapane man bana liya he? kya hamane siikhaa he ki itihaas kaa saamana kaise kiya jaae? ham class room main nahin, sadak or tivi studio main itihaas kaa hisaab karne nikle hai
 You do not change history by making Nehru a Muslim or by defeating Akbar, when history starts to change by the order of the Minister of Education, then understand that he would not have been a good student of the Chemistry
 kya aap yahaan harvard main baithkar is baat ko sweekaar kar sakate hai ki itihaas ke class room main koi mantri aakar itihaas badal de
 Take the book from the professor's hand and give it to read
 kya aap bardaasht karenge? jab aap khud ke liye yah bardaasht nahin kar sakate to bharat ke liye kaise kar sakate hai? There must be a new debate in history, there should be new research
 lekin ham vaisaa kar rahe hai
 We have debated for three months on a film
 itani bahes hamane bharat kii garibi par nahin kii, bharat kii sambhaavnaaon par nahin kii, hamane teen maheene ek film par bahes kii
 People came to the studio with swords, now someday will bring guns
 maharana kii haar ke baad bhi logon ne mahaan vijeta ke rup main sweekaar kiya tha
 His heroic saga had no effect on the defeat which an Education Minister tried to replace with his strength
 lok shrutiyon main aparaajey maharana ke liye kitabon main badi haar he
 i do not think that brave soldiers like Maharana Pratap would have been happy to write victory instead of defeat
 jo vir hota he wo haar ko bhi gale lagaataa he
 But it is true that the public does not understand the history as it is in the class room
 class room main bhi baari asamnata he
 Millions of students of history did not get good books, teachers could not find them, so they took the garbage in place of books
 kooday ko itihaas samaj liya
 Even today, we do not understand history without pride and pride
 sone kii chidiya tha hamaara desh
 The country was the world master
 ye sab visheshan hai, itihaas nahin he
 SUPERLATIVES CANT BE HISTORY
 vaise is teen maheene main bharat me jitne itihaaskaar paidaa hue hai, utane oxford or cambridge apane kai sau saal ke itihaas main paidaa nahin kar paae honge
 In India, you can become a historian just by burning, tearing posters
 kisi film kaa pradarshan rukvaa kar aap itihaaskaar ban sakate hai
 For the historians we have produced in three years, now we do not even have that much diversity
 angrezon kii kalpana thi ki bharat ke itihaas ko hindu itihaas muslim itihaas main badal do
 Today many people are fulfilling the idea of english rule
 wo waapas itihaas ko hindu banaam musalmaan ke khaanche main le ja rahe hai
 To cover the present, issues are being brought from history through which the religious identity of the citizen and voter can be created
 ham kyon apni bhartiyata kabhi anekta main ekta main khojate khojate, dharmik ekarupata main khojane lagate hai? ham samvidhan se apni pahchaan kyon nahin hasil karte, jiske liye hamane sau saal kii ladaai ladi
 Argued day and night, millions of people went to jail
 agar bahuton ko lagata he ki is sawaal par bahes honi chahie to kya ham sahi tareeke se apane sawaal rakh rahe hai, bahes kar rahe hai, kya uskaa manch akhbaar tak na padhane vaale ye ankar honge
 After all, why does the majority religion want to impose religious interpretation on the characters of history? Once our Indianness was found in the media space, my voice was made with yours, today our tone is ours, your note is yours or your tone is nothing, our voice is yours
 ham bharatiyon kaa bhartiya hone kaa bodh or itihaas bodh donon sankat se guzar rahaa he
 We are being prepared with a sense of a fragmented citizenship
 jiske bheetar phek news or phek history ke zarie aisi politicil programing kii ja rahi he ki kisi bhi shahar main chote chote samooh main logon ko trigar kiya ja saktaa he
 Can you avenge history, then you are going against the basic concept of justice which says that blood is not revenge blood
 agar ham khun kaa badla khun kii avadharana par jaaenge to hamaare chaaron taraf hinsa hi hinsa hogi
 There are two types of political identity in India at this time
 ek jo dharmik aakraamakata se las he or doosraa to dharmik aatmavishvaas kho chukaa he
 One is intimidating and frightened
 yah asantulan aane vaale samay main hamaare saamne kai chunautiyaan laane vaala hai jinhen ham koob pahachaanate hai
 We have seen its consequences, we also pay
 alag-alag samay par alag-alag samudaayon ne bhugte hai
 Old wounds are not erased from our memories that we bring new wounds
 jaise hindustan ek tu in van desh he
 Which has been recognized as India and India in our official tongue
 usee tarah hamaari pahchaan dharm or jati ke tu in van par aadhaarit he
 You look at India from these caste organizations, you will not be able to see its face in front of everyone
 aap jati kaa cheharaa chupake se ghar jaakar dekhte hai
 We did not end caste
 hamane azaad bharat main nai nai CAST COLONIES banaai hai
 These belong to CAST COLONIES CONCRETE
 iske mukhiya us aadhunik bharat main paidaa hue log hai
 Ask yourself why these castes are becoming colonies in society today
 aaj kaa matlab 2018 nahin or na hi 2014 he
 We pride India, pride of religion, pride of caste
 ham apane bheetar har tarah kii krurta ko bachaate rahanaa chaahate hai
 Is caste really a matter of pride? If the answer to this question is yes, then we are cheating with the Constitution, betraying the spirit of our national movement
 team india kaa raajnneetik slogan cast india, religen india main badal chukaa he
 a cooperative society of Brahmins has been formed in Andhra Pradesh
 iskaa mishan he brahmanon kii viraasat ko dobaaraa se jivit karnaa or use aage badhanaa
 What is the heritage of Brahmins, what is the heritage of Rajputs? Then what is the problem with Bhima Koregaon, the legacy of Dalits? Then what is the problem with the legacy of the Mughals, where the Israeli head of state also wants to spend two moments with his wife
 aap is sosayadi kii website http: / / www
 apbrahmincoop
 com par jaaiye
 Chief Minister Chandra Babu Naidu is launching its magazine because the head of this society is a member of his party
 is sosayadi ke lakshya vahiin hai jo ek sarkaar ke hone chahie
 Which should be our economic policies
 kya hamaari nitiyaan is kadar fail rahi hai ki ab ham apni apni jatiyon kaa koparative banane lage hai
 Its goal is to form a self-help group of poor Brahmin castes, give them loans to do business, buy cars
 iske sadsy sirf brahman samudaay se ho sakate hai
 There are IAS, professional people
 iske cheiman anand surya bhi brahman hai
 In his introduction, he calls himself a trade union leader and businessman
 duniya main bijanes main shaayad hi trade union netaa banate hai
 He has lived in BJP, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, Janata Dal, Samajwadi Janata Party, Janata Dal Secular
 jahaan unhone siikhaa he ki brahn samudaay ko naitik or raajnneetik samarthan kaise dena he
 We did not know that people in Samajwadi Party also learn all this
 2003 se ve tidipi main hai
 It is not the only such institution
 videshon main bhi or bharat main bhi aise anek jatigat sanghathan kaayam hai
 The political status of their presidents is more than any leader
 is spes ke baahar bina is tarah kii pahchaan ke liye netaa bananaa asambhav he
 In 2013, Vedic Society for Brahmins was started in Bangalore
 sochie ek township he sirf brahmanon kaa
 Where will this exclusion take us, is it not a kind of ghetto? 2700 ghar brahamanon ke alag se honge
 This will become a system of villages again
 brahmanon kaa alag se
 Isn't it ghetto? azaad bharat main yah kyon hua? assi ke dashak main jab houseing sosayadi kaa vistaar hua to use jati or khaas peshey ke aadhaar par basaaya gaya
 There is Patparganj in Delhi, there you will find many housing societies according to caste, occupation, region and state
 to phir ham samvidhan ke aadhaar par bhartiya kaise ban rahe the
 Can we not be an Indian without caste support? jaipur ke vidyanagar main jatiyon ke alag alag hostel bane hai
 Shri Rajput Sabha has built hostels for boys of its caste
 ladakiyon ke bhi hai
 The Yadavas also have separate hostels
 meena jati ke bhi alag chatravaas hai
 Brahmin caste also has separate hostels
 ab aap bataayen, in hostel se nikal jo bhi aage jayega wo apane bheetar kiski pahchaan ko aage rakhega
 Will his identity not clash with Constitution-based Indianness? There is also the Khatik studentship which the government has made
 kyon rajya sarkaron ko daliton ke liye alag se hostel banane kii zarurat padi? kya hamaari jatiyon ke oonche tabake ne samvidhan ke aadhaar par bharat ko abhi tak sweekaar nahin kiya he, kya vah samvidhan aadhaarit naagarikta ko pasand nahin karata he? kya jatiyon ko koi aisa samooh he jo dharm ke sahare apana varchasv phir se hasil karnaa chahta he? kya koi aisa bhi samooh he jo ab pehle se kai guna zyaada takat se is varchasv ko chunauti de rahaa he?tippaniyan Like India's politics, the media also comes from these cast colonies
 uske sampadak bhi isi cast colony se aate hai
 They do not like the identity of caste in public but they like the identity of religion
 isliye ve dharm kii pahchaan ke zarie jati kii pahchaan thel rahe hai
 This work can only be done by those who do not believe in democracy because caste is against democracy
 garvanment of media main sab kuch thik nahin he
 The positive is that it is speaking freely against democracy
 bhaichaare ke kilaaf puri azaadi se bol rahaa he
 Our Government of Media is free
 pehle se kahin azaad he
 i am ending my speech on this positive note
 kul milakar ham yathasthiti ko pramot kar rahe hai
 We are calling the pride of religion a nation
 aap chahen to darwin ko riject kar sakate hai
 If you want, you can declare Ganesh Pooja as a medical college

 Which has been recognized as India and India in our official tongue
 usee tarah hamaari pahchaan dharm or jati ke tu in van par aadhaarit he
 You look at India from these caste organizations, you will not be able to see its face in front of everyone
 aap jati kaa cheharaa chupake se ghar jaakar dekhte hai
 We did not end caste
 hamane azaad bharat main nai nai CAST COLONIES banaai hai
 These belong to CAST COLONIES CONCRETE
 iske mukhiya us aadhunik bharat main paidaa hue log hai
 Ask yourself why these castes are becoming colonies in society today
 aaj kaa matlab 2018 nahin or na hi 2014 he
 We pride India, pride of religion, pride of caste
 ham apane bheetar har tarah kii krurta ko bachaate rahanaa chaahate hai
 Is caste really a matter of pride? If the answer to this question is yes, then we are cheating with the Constitution, betraying the spirit of our national movement
 team india kaa raajnneetik slogan cast india, religen india main badal chukaa he
 a cooperative society of Brahmins has been formed in Andhra Pradesh
 iskaa mishan he brahmanon kii viraasat ko dobaaraa se jivit karnaa or use aage badhanaa
 What is the heritage of Brahmins, what is the heritage of Rajputs? Then what is the problem with Bhima Koregaon, the legacy of Dalits? Then what is the problem with the legacy of the Mughals, where the Israeli head of state also wants to spend two moments with his wife

 Chief Minister Chandra Babu Naidu is launching its magazine because the head of this society is a member of his party

 In his introduction, he calls himself a trade union leader and businessman

 He has lived in BJP, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, Janata Dal, Samajwadi Janata Party, Janata Dal Secular
 jahaan unhone siikhaa he ki brahn samudaay ko naitik or raajnneetik samarthan kaise dena he
 We did not know that people in Samajwadi Party also learn all this
 2003 se ve tidipi main hai
 It is not the only such institution
 videshon main bhi or bharat main bhi aise anek jatigat sanghathan kaayam hai
 The political status of their presidents is more than any leader
 is spes ke baahar bina is tarah kii pahchaan ke liye netaa bananaa asambhav he
 In 2013, Vedic Society for Brahmins was started in Bangalore
 sochie ek township he sirf brahmanon kaa
 Where will this exclusion take us, is it not a kind of ghetto? 2700 ghar brahamanon ke alag se honge
 This will become a system of villages again
 brahmanon kaa alag se
 Isn't it ghetto? azaad bharat main yah kyon hua? assi ke dashak main jab houseing sosayadi kaa vistaar hua to use jati or khaas peshey ke aadhaar par basaaya gaya
 There is Patparganj in Delhi, there you will find many housing societies according to caste, occupation, region and state
 to phir ham samvidhan ke aadhaar par bhartiya kaise ban rahe the
 Can we not be an Indian without caste support? jaipur ke vidyanagar main jatiyon ke alag alag hostel bane hai
 Shri Rajput Sabha has built hostels for boys of its caste
 ladakiyon ke bhi hai
 The Yadavas also have separate hostels
 meena jati ke bhi alag chatravaas hai
 Brahmin caste also has separate hostels
 ab aap bataayen, in hostel se nikal jo bhi aage jayega wo apane bheetar kiski pahchaan ko aage rakhega
 Will his identity not clash with Constitution-based Indianness? There is also the Khatik studentship which the government has made
 kyon rajya sarkaron ko daliton ke liye alag se hostel banane kii zarurat padi? kya hamaari jatiyon ke oonche tabake ne samvidhan ke aadhaar par bharat ko abhi tak sweekaar nahin kiya he, kya vah samvidhan aadhaarit naagarikta ko pasand nahin karata he? kya jatiyon ko koi aisa samooh he jo dharm ke sahare apana varchasv phir se hasil karnaa chahta he? kya koi aisa bhi samooh he jo ab pehle se kai guna zyaada takat se is varchasv ko chunauti de rahaa he?tippaniyan Like India's politics, the media also comes from these cast colonies
 uske sampadak bhi isi cast colony se aate hai
 They do not like the identity of caste in public but they like the identity of religion
 isliye ve dharm kii pahchaan ke zarie jati kii pahchaan thel rahe hai
 This work can only be done by those who do not believe in democracy because caste is against democracy
 garvanment of media main sab kuch thik nahin he
 The positive is that it is speaking freely against democracy
 bhaichaare ke kilaaf puri azaadi se bol rahaa he
 Our Government of Media is free
 pehle se kahin azaad he
 i am ending my speech on this positive note
 kul milakar ham yathasthiti ko pramot kar rahe hai
 We are calling the pride of religion a nation
 aap chahen to darwin ko riject kar sakate hai
 If you want, you can declare Ganesh Pooja as a medical college
 aisa nahin he ki garvanment of media sawaal karnaa bhul gaya
 How big a question did he ask on watching Rahul Gandhi's Star Wars
 aap kah sakate hai ki garvanment of india chaahati he ki vipaksh kaa netaa sirius rahe
 But when the leader confronts Sirius and holds a press conference about Judge Loya, the media forgets its Sirius
 doston yaad rakhana main garvanment of media kii baat kar rahaa hum, videsh main garvanment of india kii baat nahin kar rahaa hum
 In the media, is anyone scared of himself or scared of scaring someone, it is an open question
 dar kaa diene se koi lenaa dena nahin he, koi bhi dar saktaa he, khaaskar farzi cese main fansaana or kai saal tak mukademon ko latakaana jahaan aasaan ho, vahaan dar system kaa part he
 Fear is natural
 gandhi ne jail jaakar hamen jail ke dar se azaad kara diya
 Slave The poor of the poor and the illiterate from the poor and the illiterate of India were freed from the fear of jail
 2ji main do lakh karod kaa ghotaalaa hua tha, magar jab iske aaropee bari ho gaye to wo janaab aaj tak nahin bol paae hai
 Whose book is named NOT JUST AN ACCOUNTANT, THE DIARY OF NATIONS CONSCIENCE KEEPER
 jab 2ji ke aaropee bari hue, sibiai saboot pesh nahin kar pai tab maine pehali baar dekha, kisi kitaab ko cover ko chhipate hue
 You have seen this happen
 lagata he ki kitaab kah rahi he ki ye baat sahi nikali ki ye sirf accountint nahin hai, magar ye baat jhooth he ki ve neshans ke kanshiens keeper hai
 i am scared of that power when a scared media puts the headline of Super Power India
 main chahta hum ki vishwa guru banane se pehle kam se kam un collejon main guru pahunch jaaen, jahaan 8500 ladkiyaan padhati hai magar padhaane ke liye 9 teacher hai
 Then you will say if nothing good is happening
 kya yah acha nahin he ki bina teacher ke bhi hamaari ladkiyaan bie paas kar ja rahi hai
 Can you do this in Howard? Can show in Cambridge, show in Oxford, can you do it in Yale and Columbia? media ne india ke basic queshchan ko chhod diya he
 So i said that coming from so far, i will talk about the Government of Media so that you do not feel that i am talking about the Government of India
 main india kii nahin media kii aalochana kar rahaa hum
 Do not get confused between i and M
 ek hi maalik ke do channel hai
 There are two anchors in the same channel
 ek sampradayikta failaa rahaa he, ek kisaanon kii baat kar rahaa he
 One is spreading lies, one is talking of broken roads
 sawaal, ham jaise sawaal karne vaale se he, jawaab ham jaison ke paas nahin he
 You ask those who bring the media to you, who bring you to India
 phek news aaj oficial news he
 Reporters in the newsroom have finished
 reporter kaa istemaal hatyare ke rup main hota he
 In a channel, four mps sent five reporters together behind one MP
 dekhne se laga ki sara media uske peeche padaa he
 This is the new era
 daraa hua media apane camaron se aapako daraane niklaa he
 The anchors that are inciting communalism on the channels are getting space
 in ankaron ke paas sarkaar ke liye koi sawaal nahin he, sirf ek hi queshchan sabake paas he
 The name of this question is Hindu Muslim Question, HMQ
 bharat ke news ankar rashtrawaad kii aad main sampradayik ho chuke hai
 To the extent that when the youth in Udaipur climb the roof of the court carrying the saffron flag , the anchors are silent
 kya ham aisa bharat chaahate the, chaahate hai? adaalat jis samvidhan ke tahat he, usee samvidhan kii ek dhara se media apni azaadi kaa charnamrita grahan karata he
 Charanamrit must have understood
 garvanment of media ke paas ek hi agenda he
 Hindu Muslim Question
 isse jude phek news kii itani bharmaar he ki aap alt news dot in par pard sakate hai
 Now fake news has started being made from the other side
 My dear friends, believe me, Media is trying to murder our hard earned democracy
 Our Media is a murderer
 yah samaaj main aisa asantulan paidaa kar rahaa he, apni bahason ke zarie aisa zehar bo rahaa he jisase hamaare loktantr ke bheetar bhay kaa maahaul bana rahe
 Which triggers a rush anytime anywhere and overpowers you
 aap kahenge ki kya itnaa bura he, kuch bhi acha nahin he
 i know you like positive poses from time to time
 ek positive bataata hum
 India's democracy is not bent by the media's bowing down
 vah media ke mit jane se nahin mit jayega
 He neither bowed in emergency nor he would bow during the era of dock media
 bharat kaa loktantr hamaari aatma he
 We have a conscience
 aatma amar he
 You can read the Gita
 main garvanment of media kii baat kar rahaa hum
 Like you, i also dream about India
 magar jaagate hue
 The reality in front of me is a dream
 main ek aise bharat kaa sapana dekhtaa hum jo hakeekat kaa saamana kar sake
 Think about why we are entangled in questions of the past these days
 agar in sawaalon kaa saamana hi karnaa he to kya ham thik se kar rahe hai, kya in sawaalon kaa saamana karne kii jagah tivi kaa studio he? yaa classroom he, conference room hai, or saamana ham kis tarah se karenge, kya ham aaj hisaab karenge, kya ham aaj qatleam karenge? to kya aap apane ghar se ek hatyara dene ke liye taiyaar hai? nafrat kii yah aandhi har ghar main ek hatyara paidaa kar jaaegi, wo aapkaa bhai ho saktaa he, betaa ho saktaa he, dost ho saktaa he, padosi ho saktaa he, kya aapane man bana liya he? kya hamane siikhaa he ki itihaas kaa saamana kaise kiya jaae? ham class room main nahin, sadak or tivi studio main itihaas kaa hisaab karne nikle hai
 You do not change history by making Nehru a Muslim or by defeating Akbar, when history starts to change by the order of the Minister of Education, then understand that he would not have been a good student of the Chemistry
 kya aap yahaan harvard main baithkar is baat ko sweekaar kar sakate hai ki itihaas ke class room main koi mantri aakar itihaas badal de
 Take the book from the professor's hand and give it to read
 kya aap bardaasht karenge? jab aap khud ke liye yah bardaasht nahin kar sakate to bharat ke liye kaise kar sakate hai? There must be a new debate in history, there should be new research
 lekin ham vaisaa kar rahe hai
 We have debated for three months on a film
 itani bahes hamane bharat kii garibi par nahin kii, bharat kii sambhaavnaaon par nahin kii, hamane teen maheene ek film par bahes kii
 People came to the studio with swords, now someday will bring guns
 maharana kii haar ke baad bhi logon ne mahaan vijeta ke rup main sweekaar kiya tha
 His heroic saga had no effect on the defeat which an Education Minister tried to replace with his strength
 lok shrutiyon main aparaajey maharana ke liye kitabon main badi haar he
 i do not think that brave soldiers like Maharana Pratap would have been happy to write victory instead of defeat
 jo vir hota he wo haar ko bhi gale lagaataa he
 But it is true that the public does not understand the history as it is in the class room
 class room main bhi baari asamnata he
 Millions of students of history did not get good books, teachers could not find them, so they took the garbage in place of books
 kooday ko itihaas samaj liya
 Even today, we do not understand history without pride and pride
 sone kii chidiya tha hamaara desh
 The country was the world master
 ye sab visheshan hai, itihaas nahin he
 SUPERLATIVES CANT BE HISTORY
 vaise is teen maheene main bharat me jitne itihaaskaar paidaa hue hai, utane oxford or cambridge apane kai sau saal ke itihaas main paidaa nahin kar paae honge
 In India, you can become a historian just by burning, tearing posters
 kisi film kaa pradarshan rukvaa kar aap itihaaskaar ban sakate hai
 For the historians we have produced in three years, now we do not even have that much diversity
 angrezon kii kalpana thi ki bharat ke itihaas ko hindu itihaas muslim itihaas main badal do
 Today many people are fulfilling the idea of english rule
 wo waapas itihaas ko hindu banaam musalmaan ke khaanche main le ja rahe hai
 To cover the present, issues are being brought from history through which the religious identity of the citizen and voter can be created
 ham kyon apni bhartiyata kabhi anekta main ekta main khojate khojate, dharmik ekarupata main khojane lagate hai? ham samvidhan se apni pahchaan kyon nahin hasil karte, jiske liye hamane sau saal kii ladaai ladi
 Argued day and night, millions of people went to jail
 agar bahuton ko lagata he ki is sawaal par bahes honi chahie to kya ham sahi tareeke se apane sawaal rakh rahe hai, bahes kar rahe hai, kya uskaa manch akhbaar tak na padhane vaale ye ankar honge
 After all, why does the majority religion want to impose religious interpretation on the characters of history? Once our Indianness was found in the media space, my voice was made with yours, today our tone is ours, your note is yours or your tone is nothing, our voice is yours
 ham bharatiyon kaa bhartiya hone kaa bodh or itihaas bodh donon sankat se guzar rahaa he
 We are being prepared with a sense of a fragmented citizenship
 jiske bheetar phek news or phek history ke zarie aisi politicil programing kii ja rahi he ki kisi bhi shahar main chote chote samooh main logon ko trigar kiya ja saktaa he
 Can you avenge history, then you are going against the basic concept of justice which says that blood is not revenge blood
 agar ham khun kaa badla khun kii avadharana par jaaenge to hamaare chaaron taraf hinsa hi hinsa hogi
 There are two types of political identity in India at this time
 ek jo dharmik aakraamakata se las he or doosraa to dharmik aatmavishvaas kho chukaa he
 One is intimidating and frightened
 yah asantulan aane vaale samay main hamaare saamne kai chunautiyaan laane vaala hai jinhen ham koob pahachaanate hai
 We have seen its consequences, we also pay
 alag-alag samay par alag-alag samudaayon ne bhugte hai
 Old wounds are not erased from our memories that we bring new wounds
 jaise hindustan ek tu in van desh he
 Which has been recognized as India and India in our official tongue
 usee tarah hamaari pahchaan dharm or jati ke tu in van par aadhaarit he
 You look at India from these caste organizations, you will not be able to see its face in front of everyone
 aap jati kaa cheharaa chupake se ghar jaakar dekhte hai
 We did not end caste
 hamane azaad bharat main nai nai CAST COLONIES banaai hai
 These belong to CAST COLONIES CONCRETE
 iske mukhiya us aadhunik bharat main paidaa hue log hai
 Ask yourself why these castes are becoming colonies in society today
 aaj kaa matlab 2018 nahin or na hi 2014 he
 We pride India, pride of religion, pride of caste
 ham apane bheetar har tarah kii krurta ko bachaate rahanaa chaahate hai
 Is caste really a matter of pride? If the answer to this question is yes, then we are cheating with the Constitution, betraying the spirit of our national movement
 team india kaa raajnneetik slogan cast india, religen india main badal chukaa he
 a cooperative society of Brahmins has been formed in Andhra Pradesh
 iskaa mishan he brahmanon kii viraasat ko dobaaraa se jivit karnaa or use aage badhanaa
 What is the heritage of Brahmins, what is the heritage of Rajputs? Then what is the problem with Bhima Koregaon, the legacy of Dalits? Then what is the problem with the legacy of the Mughals, where the Israeli head of state also wants to spend two moments with his wife

 If you want, you can declare Ganesh Pooja as a medical college
 media main kya koi khud se dar gaya he yaa kisi ke daraane se dar gaya he, yah ek khulaa prashn he
 Fear has nothing to do with DNA, anyone can be afraid, especially in a fake case and hanging lawsuits for many years where it is easy, fear is part of the system
 dar natural he
 Gandhi went to jail and freed us from the fear of jail
 ghulaam bharat ke garib se garib or anpadh se anpadh log jail ke dar se azaad ho gaye
 There was a scam of 2 lakh crores in 2G, but when the accused are acquitted, they have not been able to speak till date
 jinaki kitaab kaa naam he NOT JUST AN ACCOUNTANT, THE DIARY OF NATIONS CONSCIENCE KEEPER
 When the 2G accused were acquitted, the CBI was unable to produce evidence when i first saw it, while hiding the cover of a book
 aapane dekha he aisa hote hue
 It seems that the book is saying that it turned out to be true that they are not just accountants, but it is a lie that they are the conscience keeper of the nations
 ek daraa hua media jab super power india kaa hedline lagaataa he tab mujhe us power se dar lagata he
 i want Guru to reach at least those colleges where 8500 girls study but 9 teachers to teach before becoming a world teacher
 phir aap kahenge ki kya kuch bhi acha nahin ho rahaa he
 Is it not good that our girls are passing BA even without teachers? kya aap aisa harvard main karke dikhaa sakate hai? cambridge main dikhaa sakate hai, oxford main dikhaa sakate hai, kya aap yel or colombia main aisa karke dikhaa sakate hai? Media has left the basic question of India
 isliye maine kaha ki itani dur se aakar main garvanment of media kii baat karuunga taaki aapako na lage ki main garvanment of india kii baat kar rahaa hum
 i am criticizing the media, not India
 aap i or m main kanfus mat kar janaa
 There are two channels of the same owner
 ek hi channel main do ankar hai
 One is spreading communalism, one is talking of farmers
 ek jhooth failaa rahaa he, ek tuuti sadakon kii baat kar rahaa he
 The question is from the questioner like us, like we do not have the answer
 aap unase puuchhie jo aap tak media ko lekar aate hai, jo aap tak india lekar aate hai
 Fake News is official news today
 news room main reporter samaapt ho chuke hai
 The reporter is used as a murderer
 ek channel main ek saansad ke pich chaar paanch reporter ek saath bhej diya
 It was seen that all the media was behind him
 yah nayaa daur he
 Scared media has come to scare you with its cameras
 channelon par sampradayikta bhadakaane vaale ankaron ko jagah mil rahi he
 These anchors have no question for the government, only one question is with everyone
 is sawaal kaa naam he hindu muslim queshchan, HMQ
 India's news anchors have become communal under the guise of nationalism
 is had tak ki jab udaipur main noujvaan bhagava jhanda lekar adaalat kii chat par chadh jate hai to ankar chup ho gaye hai
 Did we want such an India, want it? The constitution under which the court is under the same constitution, the media assumes the phase of its independence
 charnamrita to samajhate honge
 The Government of Media has the same agenda
 hindu muslim queshchan
 There is so much of fake news related to it that you can read on Alt News
com
 ab to phek news duusari taraf se banane lage hai
 My dear friends, believe me, media is trying to murder our hard earned democracy
 Our Media is a murderer
 It is creating such an imbalance in the society, through its debates, is poisoning such a poison that creates an atmosphere of fear within our democracy
 jisase ek bheed kabhi bhi kahin bhi trigar ho jaati he or aapako overpavar kar detii he
 You would say what is so bad, nothing is good
 mujhe pataa he ki aapako bich bich main positive acha lagata he
 i will tell you a positive bharat kaa loktantr media ke jhuk jane se nahin jhuk jaataa he
 It will not disappear as media is lost
 vah na to apatkaal main jhukaa na vah godi media ke kaal main jhukegaa
 The democracy of India is our soul
 hamaara zamir he
 The soul is immortal
 aap gita pard sakate hai
 i am talking about the Government of Media
 aapaki tarah main bhi bharat ko lekar sapane dekhtaa hum
 But while awake saamne kii hakeekat hi mere liye sapana he
 i dream of an India that can face reality
 sochie zaraa ham aaj kal ateet ke sawaalon me kyon uljhe hai
 If we have to face these questions, then are we doing properly, is there a TV studio instead of facing these questions? Or is it a classroom, a conference room, and how will we face it, will we calculate today, will we commit murder today? So are you ready to deliver a killer from your home? This storm of hate will create a killer in every house, it can be your brother, can be a son, can be a friend, can be a neighbor, have you made up your mind? Have we learned how to face history? We are out in the class room, not in the street and TV studios to calculate history
 nehru ko musalmaan bana dene se yaa akbar ko parajeet bana dene se aap itihaas nahin badal dete, itihaas jab shiksha mantri ke aadesh se badalane lage to samajhie ki vah mantri chemistry kaa bhi acha vidhyaarthee nahin rahaa hoga
 Can you accept sitting here at Harvard and change the history by having a minister come to the class room of history
 professor ke haath se kitaab lekar, apni kitaab padhane ke liye de de
 Will you tolerate How can you do it for India when you can't afford it for yourself? zarur itihaas main nai bahes chalani chahie, nae shodh hone chahie
 But we are doing so
 ek film par hamane teen maheene bahes kii he
 We did not debate so much on India's poverty, did not debate India's prospects, we debated a film for three months
 talavaarein lekar log studio main aa gaye, ab kisi din bandooken lekar aaenge
 Even after the defeat of Maharana, people were accepted as great conquerors
 unki veerta kii gaatha par us haar kaa koi asar hi nahin tha, jise ek shiksha mantri ne apni takat se badalane kii koshish kii
 There is a big defeat in books for the unbeatable Maharana in folk legends
 mujhe nahin lagata ki maharana pratap jaise bahadur kaagaz par haar kii jagah jeet likh dene se khush hote
 The one who is brave also embraces defeat
 par yah sahi he ki public main itihaas ko lekar waisi samaj nahin he jaisi class room main he
 There is heavy disharmony in the class room as well
 itihaas ke lakhon chaatro ko acchhee kitaaben nahin milin, shikshak nahin mili isliye sabane kitaab kii jagah kooda uthaa liya
 Litter understood history
 ham aaj bhi itihaas ko gaurav gaan or gaurav bhav ke bina nahin samaj pate hai
 The gold bird was our country
 vishwa guru tha desh
 These are all adjectives, not history
 SUPERLATIVES CANT BE HISTORY
 However, the number of historians born in India in this three months, Oxford and Cambridge could not have been born in their history of several hundred years
 bharat main aap bas jalaakar, poster fadkar itihaaskaar ban sakate hai
 You can become a historian by stopping the performance of a film
 teen saal main hamane jinte itihaaskaar paidaa kiye hai, unke liye ab hamaare paas utani universti bhi nahin hai
 It was the imagination of the British to convert the history of India to Hindu history into Muslim history
 aaj bahut se log angrezi hukumat kii soch ko puraa kar rahe hai
 They are taking history back into the mold of Hindu versus Muslim
 vartmaan par pardaa daalane ke liye itihaas se vaise mudde laae ja rahe hai jinke zarie naagarik kaa, matadaata kaa dharmik pahchaan banaai ja sake
 Why do we ever seek our Indianness in unity in diversity, in religious uniformity? Why don't we get our identity from the Constitution, for which we fought for a hundred years
 din raat bahes kiye, lakhon log jail gaye
 If many feel that this question should be debated, are we rightly placing our questions, arguing, will these forums be the anchors not reading the newspaper
 akhir kyon bahusankhyak dharm itihaas ke kirdaaron par dharmik vyakhya thopanaa chahta he? kabhi media ke spes main hamaari bhartiyata mili sur meraa tumhaara se banati thi, aaj hamaara sur hamaara, tumhaara sur tumhaara yaa tumhaara sur kuch nahin, hamaara hi sur tumhaara
 We Indians are going through both a crisis and a sense of being an Indian
 hamen ek khandit naagarikta ke bodh ke saath taiyaar kiye ja rahe hai
 Within which such political programming is being done through fake news and fake history that people can be triggered in small groups in any city
 kya aap itihaas kaa badla le sakate hai to phir aap nyaay kii mul avadharana ke khilaaf ja rahe hai jo kahata he ki khun kaa badla khun nahin hota he
 If we go to the concept of blood revenge, then violence will be violence all around us
 is samay bharat main do tarah ke polytical aaidentity hai
 One who is armed with religious aggression and the other has lost religious confidence
 ek daraane vaala he or daraa hua he
 This imbalance is going to bring many challenges in front of us which we recognize very well
 hamane iske nattejey dekhe hai, bhugte bhi hai
 Different communities pay at different times
 hamaari smritiyon se puraane zakhm mitate bhi nahin ki ham nae zakhm le aate hai
 Like India is a two in one country
 jise hamaari sarkari jubaan main india or bharat ke rup main pahchaan mil chuki he
 In the same way, our identity is based on two in one religion and caste
 aap in jati sanghathanon kii taraf se bharat ko dekhie, aap uskaa cheharaa sabake saamne dekh nahin paaenge
 You see the face of the caste secretly at home
 hamane jati ko khatm nahin kiya
 We have created new new CAST COLONIES in free India
 ye CAST COLONIES CONCRETE kii hai
 Its head is a people born in that modern India
 puuchhie khud se ki aaj kyon samaaj main ye jati coloni ban rahi hai
 Today does not mean 2018 nor 2014
 ham bharat kaa gaurav karte hai, dharm kaa gaurav karte hai, jati kaa gaurav karte hai
 We want to save all the cruelty within us
 kya jati vaaki gaurav karne kii chiz he? is sawaal kaa jawaab agar haa he to ham samvidhan ke saath dhokhaa kar rahe hai, apane rashtriya andolan kii bhaavana ke saath dhokhaa kar rahe hai
 The political slogan of Team India has changed to Cast India, Religion India
 andhra pradesh main brahn jati kii ek koparative sosayadi bani he
 Its mission is to revive and carry forward the legacy of Brahmins
 brahmanon kii viraasat kya he, rajputon kii viraasat kya he? to phir daliton kii viraasat bhima koregaanv se kya dikkat he? phir mughalon kii viraasat se kya dikkat he jahaan israel ke raashtra pramukh bhi apni patni ke saath do pal guzaarana chaahate hai

 mukhyamantri chandra babu naidu isaki patrika laanch kar rahe hai kyonki is sosayadi kaa mukhiya unki party kaa sadsy he
 The goals of this society are what the government should have
 jo hamaari aarthik nitiyon ke hone chahie
 Are our policies failing so much that now we have started making our own castes cooperative
 iskaa lakshya he garib brahman jatiyon kaa self helf group bananaa, unhen bijness karne, gaadi kharidne kaa lone dena
 Its members can only be from the Brahmin community
 iees hai, peshewar log hai
 Its chairman Anand Surya is also a Brahmin
 apana parichay main khud ko trade union netaa or bijnesaman likhte hai
 Business men rarely become trade union leaders in the world
 ve bijepi, bhartiya mazdoor sangh, janata dal, samaajawaadee janata party, janata dal secular main rah chuke hai
 Where he has learned how to give moral and political support to the Brahmin community
 hamen pataa hi nahin tha samaajawaadee party main log ye sab bhi sikhte hai
 He has been in TDP since 2003
 yah akelaa aisa santhaan nahin he
 Many such caste organizations are established in foreign countries as well as in India
 inke adhyakshon kii raajnneetik haisiyat kisi netaa se adhik he
 Without this space it is impossible to become a leader without such identification
 bangaloru main to 2013 main sirf brahmanon ke liye vaidic sosayadi banani shuru ho gai thi
 Think a township is only of Brahmins
 ye excluzan hamen kahaan le jayega, kya yah ek tarah kaa gheto nahin he
 2700 houses will be separate from Brahmins
 ye to phir se gaanvon vaala system ho jayega
 Of Brahmins separately
 kya yah gheto nahin he? Why did this happen in free India? When the housing society expanded in the eighties, it was settled on the basis of caste and particular profession
 dilli main patpadganj he, vahaan par jati, pesha, ilaaka or rajya ke hisaab se kai houseing sosayadi aapako milegi
 Then how were we becoming Indians based on the Constitution
 kya bina jati ke samarthan ke ham bhartiya nahin ho sakate
 There are different hostels of castes in Vidyanagar, Jaipur
 shri rajput sabha ne apni jati ke ladakon ke liye hostel banaae hai
 They also have girls
 yadavon ke bhi alag hostel hai
 Meena caste also has separate hostels
 brahman jati ke bhi alag hostel hai
 Now you tell me, whoever goes beyond these hostels will put forward their identity within themselves
 kya uski pahchaan kaa samvidhan aadhaarit bhartiyata se takaraav nahin hoga? khatic chatrawas bhi he jo sarkaar ne banaae hai
 Why did state governments need to create separate hostels for Dalits? Has the upper strata of our castes not yet accepted India on the basis of the constitution, does it not like constitution-based citizenship? Is there any group of castes that want to regain their supremacy with the help of religion? Is there any group that is now challenging this domination with many times more power than before? bharat kii raajnneeti kii tarah media bhi inhen cast colony se aata he
 Its editors also come from the same cast colony
 unhen public main jati kii pahchaan thik nahin lagati magar unhen dharm kii pahchaan thik lagati he
 That is why they are promoting the identity of caste through the identity of religion
 yah kaam vahi kar saktaa he jo loktantr main yakeen nahin rakhata ho kyonki jati loktantr ke kilaaf he
 All is not well in the Government of Media
 positive yahi he ki loktantr ke kilaaf yah puri azaadi se bol rahaa he
 Is speaking freely against brotherhood
 hamaari garvanment of media azaad he
 Free than ever
 isi positive note par main apana bhaashan samaapt kar rahaa hum
 Overall, we are promoting the status quo
 dharm ke gaurav ko ham raashtra bataa rahe hai
 If you wish, you can reject Darwin
 aap chahen to ganesh puja ko hi medical college kii padhai ghoshit kar sakate hai
 i am scared of that power when a scared media puts the headline of Super Power India
 main chahta hum ki vishwa guru banane se pehle kam se kam un collejon main guru pahunch jaaen, jahaan 8500 ladkiyaan padhati hai magar padhaane ke liye 9 teacher hai
 Then you will say if nothing good is happening
 kya yah acha nahin he ki bina teacher ke bhi hamaari ladkiyaan bie paas kar ja rahi hai
 Can you do this in Howard? Can show in Cambridge, show in Oxford, can you do it in Yale and Columbia? media ne india ke basic queshchan ko chhod diya he
 So i said that coming from so far, i will talk about the Government of Media so that you do not feel that i am talking about the Government of India
 main india kii nahin media kii aalochana kar rahaa hum
 Do not get confused between i and M
 ek hi maalik ke do channel hai
 There are two anchors in the same channel
 ek sampradayikta failaa rahaa he, ek kisaanon kii baat kar rahaa he
 One is spreading lies, one is talking of broken roads
 sawaal, ham jaise sawaal karne vaale se he, jawaab ham jaison ke paas nahin he
 You ask those who bring the media to you, who bring you to India
 phek news aaj oficial news he
 Reporters in the newsroom have finished
 reporter kaa istemaal hatyare ke rup main hota he
 In a channel, four mps sent five reporters together behind one MP
 dekhne se laga ki sara media uske peeche padaa he
 This is the new era
 daraa hua media apane camaron se aapako daraane niklaa he
 The anchors that are inciting communalism on the channels are getting space
 in ankaron ke paas sarkaar ke liye koi sawaal nahin he, sirf ek hi queshchan sabake paas he
 The name of this question is Hindu Muslim Question, HMQ
 bharat ke news ankar rashtrawaad kii aad main sampradayik ho chuke hai
 To the extent that when the youth in Udaipur climb the roof of the court carrying the saffron flag, the anchors are silent
 kya ham aisa bharat chaahate the, chaahate hai? adaalat jis samvidhan ke tahat he, usee samvidhan kii ek dhara se media apni azaadi kaa charnamrita grahan karata he
 Charanamrit must have understood
 garvanment of media ke paas ek hi agenda he
 Hindu Muslim Question
 isse jude phek news kii itani bharmaar he ki aap alt news dot in par pard sakate hai
 Now fake news has started being made from the other side
 My dear friends, believe me, Media is trying to murder our hard earned democracy
 Our Media is a murderer
 yah samaaj main aisa asantulan paidaa kar rahaa he, apni bahason ke zarie aisa zehar bo rahaa he jisase hamaare loktantr ke bheetar bhay kaa maahaul bana rahe
 Which triggers a rush anytime anywhere and overpowers you
 aap kahenge ki kya itnaa bura he, kuch bhi acha nahin he
 i know you like positive poses from time to time
 ek positive bataata hum
 India's democracy is not bent by the media's bowing down
 vah media ke mit jane se nahin mit jayega
 He neither bowed in emergency nor he would bow during the era of dock media
 bharat kaa loktantr hamaari aatma he
 We have a conscience
 aatma amar he
 You can read the Gita
 main garvanment of media kii baat kar rahaa hum
 Like you, i also dream about India
 magar jaagate hue
 The reality in front of me is a dream
 main ek aise bharat kaa sapana dekhtaa hum jo hakeekat kaa saamana kar sake
 Think about why we are entangled in questions of the past these days
 agar in sawaalon kaa saamana hi karnaa he to kya ham thik se kar rahe hai, kya in sawaalon kaa saamana karne kii jagah tivi kaa studio he? yaa classroom he, conference room hai, or saamana ham kis tarah se karenge, kya ham aaj hisaab karenge, kya ham aaj qatleam karenge? to kya aap apane ghar se ek hatyara dene ke liye taiyaar hai? nafrat kii yah aandhi har ghar main ek hatyara paidaa kar jaaegi, wo aapkaa bhai ho saktaa he, betaa ho saktaa he, dost ho saktaa he, padosi ho saktaa he, kya aapane man bana liya he? kya hamane siikhaa he ki itihaas kaa saamana kaise kiya jaae? ham class room main nahin, sadak or tivi studio main itihaas kaa hisaab karne nikle hai
 You do not change history by making Nehru a Muslim or by defeating Akbar, when history starts to change by the order of the Minister of Education, then understand that he would not have been a good student of the Chemistry
 kya aap yahaan harvard main baithkar is baat ko sweekaar kar sakate hai ki itihaas ke class room main koi mantri aakar itihaas badal de
 Take the book from the professor's hand and give it to read
 kya aap bardaasht karenge? jab aap khud ke liye yah bardaasht nahin kar sakate to bharat ke liye kaise kar sakate hai? There must be a new debate in history, there should be new research
 lekin ham vaisaa kar rahe hai
 We have debated for three months on a film
 itani bahes hamane bharat kii garibi par nahin kii, bharat kii sambhaavnaaon par nahin kii, hamane teen maheene ek film par bahes kii
 People came to the studio with swords, now someday will bring guns
 maharana kii haar ke baad bhi logon ne mahaan vijeta ke rup main sweekaar kiya tha
 His heroic saga had no effect on the defeat which an Education Minister tried to replace with his strength
 lok shrutiyon main aparaajey maharana ke liye kitabon main badi haar he
 i do not think that brave soldiers like Maharana Pratap would have been happy to write victory instead of defeat
 jo vir hota he wo haar ko bhi gale lagaataa he
 But it is true that the public does not understand the history as it is in the class room
 class room main bhi baari asamnata he
 Millions of students of history did not get good books, teachers could not find them, so they took the garbage in place of books
 kooday ko itihaas samaj liya
 Even today, we do not understand history without pride and pride
 sone kii chidiya tha hamaara desh
 The country was the world master
 ye sab visheshan hai, itihaas nahin he
 SUPERLATIVES CANT BE HISTORY
 vaise is teen maheene main bharat me jitne itihaaskaar paidaa hue hai, utane oxford or cambridge apane kai sau saal ke itihaas main paidaa nahin kar paae honge
 In India, you can become a historian just by burning, tearing posters
 kisi film kaa pradarshan rukvaa kar aap itihaaskaar ban sakate hai
 For the historians we have produced in three years, now we do not even have that much diversity
 angrezon kii kalpana thi ki bharat ke itihaas ko hindu itihaas muslim itihaas main badal do
 Today many people are fulfilling the idea of english rule
 wo waapas itihaas ko hindu banaam musalmaan ke khaanche main le ja rahe hai
 To cover the present, issues are being brought from history through which the religious identity of the citizen and voter can be created
 ham kyon apni bhartiyata kabhi anekta main ekta main khojate khojate, dharmik ekarupata main khojane lagate hai? ham samvidhan se apni pahchaan kyon nahin hasil karte, jiske liye hamane sau saal kii ladaai ladi
 Argued day and night, millions of people went to jail
 agar bahuton ko lagata he ki is sawaal par bahes honi chahie to kya ham sahi tareeke se apane sawaal rakh rahe hai, bahes kar rahe hai, kya uskaa manch akhbaar tak na padhane vaale ye ankar honge
 After all, why does the majority religion want to impose religious interpretation on the characters of history? Once our Indianness was found in the media space, my voice was made with yours, today our tone is ours, your note is yours or your tone is nothing, our voice is yours
 ham bharatiyon kaa bhartiya hone kaa bodh or itihaas bodh donon sankat se guzar rahaa he
 We are being prepared with a sense of a fragmented citizenship
 jiske bheetar phek news or phek history ke zarie aisi politicil programing kii ja rahi he ki kisi bhi shahar main chote chote samooh main logon ko trigar kiya ja saktaa he
 Can you avenge history, then you are going against the basic concept of justice which says that blood is not revenge blood
 agar ham khun kaa badla khun kii avadharana par jaaenge to hamaare chaaron taraf hinsa hi hinsa hogi
 There are two types of political identity in India at this time
 ek jo dharmik aakraamakata se las he or doosraa to dharmik aatmavishvaas kho chukaa he
 One is intimidating and frightened
 yah asantulan aane vaale samay main hamaare saamne kai chunautiyaan laane vaala hai jinhen ham koob pahachaanate hai
 We have seen its consequences, we also pay
 alag-alag samay par alag-alag samudaayon ne bhugte hai
 Old wounds are not erased from our memories that we bring new wounds
 jaise hindustan ek tu in van desh he
 Which has been recognized as India and India in our official tongue
 usee tarah hamaari pahchaan dharm or jati ke tu in van par aadhaarit he
 You look at India from these caste organizations, you will not be able to see its face in front of everyone
 aap jati kaa cheharaa chupake se ghar jaakar dekhte hai
 We did not end caste
 hamane azaad bharat main nai nai CAST COLONIES banaai hai
 These belong to CAST COLONIES CONCRETE
 iske mukhiya us aadhunik bharat main paidaa hue log hai
 Ask yourself why these castes are becoming colonies in society today
 aaj kaa matlab 2018 nahin or na hi 2014 he
 We pride India, pride of religion, pride of caste
 ham apane bheetar har tarah kii krurta ko bachaate rahanaa chaahate hai
 Is caste really a matter of pride? If the answer to this question is yes, then we are cheating with the Constitution, betraying the spirit of our national movement
 team india kaa raajnneetik slogan cast india, religen india main badal chukaa he
 a cooperative society of Brahmins has been formed in Andhra Pradesh
 iskaa mishan he brahmanon kii viraasat ko dobaaraa se jivit karnaa or use aage badhanaa
 What is the heritage of Brahmins, what is the heritage of Rajputs? Then what is the problem with Bhima Koregaon, the legacy of Dalits? Then what is the problem with the legacy of the Mughals, where the Israeli head of state also wants to spend two moments with his wife
 aap is sosayadi kii website http: / / www
 apbrahmincoop
 com par jaaiye
 Chief Minister Chandra Babu Naidu is launching its magazine because the head of this society is a member of his party
 is sosayadi ke lakshya vahiin hai jo ek sarkaar ke hone chahie
 Which should be our economic policies
 kya hamaari nitiyaan is kadar fail rahi hai ki ab ham apni apni jatiyon kaa koparative banane lage hai
 Its goal is to form a self-help group of poor Brahmin castes, give them loans to do business, buy cars
 iske sadsy sirf brahman samudaay se ho sakate hai
 There are IAS, professional people
 iske cheiman anand surya bhi brahman hai
 In his introduction, he calls himself a trade union leader and businessman
 duniya main bijanes main shaayad hi trade union netaa banate hai
 He has lived in BJP, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, Janata Dal, Samajwadi Janata Party, Janata Dal Secular
 jahaan unhone siikhaa he ki brahn samudaay ko naitik or raajnneetik samarthan kaise dena he
 We did not know that people in Samajwadi Party also learn all this
 2003 se ve tidipi main hai
 It is not the only such institution
 videshon main bhi or bharat main bhi aise anek jatigat sanghathan kaayam hai
 The political status of their presidents is more than any leader
 is spes ke baahar bina is tarah kii pahchaan ke liye netaa bananaa asambhav he
 In 2013, Vedic Society for Brahmins was started in Bangalore
 sochie ek township he sirf brahmanon kaa
 Where will this exclusion take us, is it not a kind of ghetto? 2700 ghar brahamanon ke alag se honge
 This will become a system of villages again
 brahmanon kaa alag se
 Isn't it ghetto? azaad bharat main yah kyon hua? assi ke dashak main jab houseing sosayadi kaa vistaar hua to use jati or khaas peshey ke aadhaar par basaaya gaya
 There is Patparganj in Delhi, there you will find many housing societies according to caste, occupation, region and state
 to phir ham samvidhan ke aadhaar par bhartiya kaise ban rahe the
 Can we not be an Indian without caste support? jaipur ke vidyanagar main jatiyon ke alag alag hostel bane hai
 Shri Rajput Sabha has built hostels for boys of its caste
 ladakiyon ke bhi hai
 The Yadavas also have separate hostels
 meena jati ke bhi alag chatravaas hai
 Brahmin caste also has separate hostels
 ab aap bataayen, in hostel se nikal jo bhi aage jayega wo apane bheetar kiski pahchaan ko aage rakhega
 Will his identity not clash with Constitution-based Indianness? There is also the Khatik studentship which the government has made
 kyon rajya sarkaron ko daliton ke liye alag se hostel banane kii zarurat padi? kya hamaari jatiyon ke oonche tabake ne samvidhan ke aadhaar par bharat ko abhi tak sweekaar nahin kiya he, kya vah samvidhan aadhaarit naagarikta ko pasand nahin karata he? kya jatiyon ko koi aisa samooh he jo dharm ke sahare apana varchasv phir se hasil karnaa chahta he? kya koi aisa bhi samooh he jo ab pehle se kai guna zyaada takat se is varchasv ko chunauti de rahaa he?tippaniyan Like India's politics, the media also comes from these cast colonies
 uske sampadak bhi isi cast colony se aate hai
 They do not like the identity of caste in public but they like the identity of religion
 isliye ve dharm kii pahchaan ke zarie jati kii pahchaan thel rahe hai
 This work can only be done by those who do not believe in democracy because caste is against democracy
 garvanment of media main sab kuch thik nahin he
 The positive is that it is speaking freely against democracy
 bhaichaare ke kilaaf puri azaadi se bol rahaa he
 Our Government of Media is free
 pehle se kahin azaad he
 i am ending my speech on this positive note
 kul milakar ham yathasthiti ko pramot kar rahe hai
 We are calling the pride of religion a nation
 aap chahen to darwin ko riject kar sakate hai
 If you want, you can declare Ganesh Pooja as a medical college
 media ne india ke basic queshchan ko chhod diya he
 So i said that coming from so far, i will talk about the Government of Media so that you do not feel that i am talking about the Government of India

 Chief Minister Chandra Babu Naidu is launching its magazine because the head of this society is a member of his party
 is sosayadi ke lakshya vahiin hai jo ek sarkaar ke hone chahie
 Which should be our economic policies
 kya hamaari nitiyaan is kadar fail rahi hai ki ab ham apni apni jatiyon kaa koparative banane lage hai
 Its goal is to form a self-help group of poor Brahmin castes, give them loans to do business, buy cars
 iske sadsy sirf brahman samudaay se ho sakate hai
 There are IAS, professional people
 iske cheiman anand surya bhi brahman hai
 In his introduction, he calls himself a trade union leader and businessman
 duniya main bijanes main shaayad hi trade union netaa banate hai
 He has lived in BJP, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, Janata Dal, Samajwadi Janata Party, Janata Dal Secular
 jahaan unhone siikhaa he ki brahn samudaay ko naitik or raajnneetik samarthan kaise dena he
 We did not know that people in Samajwadi Party also learn all this
 2003 se ve tidipi main hai
 It is not the only such institution
 videshon main bhi or bharat main bhi aise anek jatigat sanghathan kaayam hai
 The political status of their presidents is more than any leader
 is spes ke baahar bina is tarah kii pahchaan ke liye netaa bananaa asambhav he
 In 2013, Vedic Society for Brahmins was started in Bangalore
 sochie ek township he sirf brahmanon kaa
 Where will this exclusion take us, is it not a kind of ghetto? 2700 ghar brahamanon ke alag se honge
 This will become a system of villages again
 brahmanon kaa alag se
 Isn't it ghetto? azaad bharat main yah kyon hua? assi ke dashak main jab houseing sosayadi kaa vistaar hua to use jati or khaas peshey ke aadhaar par basaaya gaya
 There is Patparganj in Delhi, there you will find many housing societies according to caste, occupation, region and state
 to phir ham samvidhan ke aadhaar par bhartiya kaise ban rahe the
 Can we not be an Indian without caste support? jaipur ke vidyanagar main jatiyon ke alag alag hostel bane hai
 Shri Rajput Sabha has built hostels for boys of its caste
 ladakiyon ke bhi hai
 The Yadavas also have separate hostels
 meena jati ke bhi alag chatravaas hai
 Brahmin caste also has separate hostels
 ab aap bataayen, in hostel se nikal jo bhi aage jayega wo apane bheetar kiski pahchaan ko aage rakhega
 Will his identity not clash with Constitution-based Indianness? There is also the Khatik studentship which the government has made
 kyon rajya sarkaron ko daliton ke liye alag se hostel banane kii zarurat padi? kya hamaari jatiyon ke oonche tabake ne samvidhan ke aadhaar par bharat ko abhi tak sweekaar nahin kiya he, kya vah samvidhan aadhaarit naagarikta ko pasand nahin karata he? kya jatiyon ko koi aisa samooh he jo dharm ke sahare apana varchasv phir se hasil karnaa chahta he? kya koi aisa bhi samooh he jo ab pehle se kai guna zyaada takat se is varchasv ko chunauti de rahaa he?tippaniyan Like India's politics, the media also comes from these cast colonies
 uske sampadak bhi isi cast colony se aate hai
 They do not like the identity of caste in public but they like the identity of religion
 isliye ve dharm kii pahchaan ke zarie jati kii pahchaan thel rahe hai
 This work can only be done by those who do not believe in democracy because caste is against democracy
 garvanment of media main sab kuch thik nahin he
 The positive is that it is speaking freely against democracy
 bhaichaare ke kilaaf puri azaadi se bol rahaa he
 Our Government of Media is free
 pehle se kahin azaad he
 i am ending my speech on this positive note
 kul milakar ham yathasthiti ko pramot kar rahe hai
 We are calling the pride of religion a nation
 aap chahen to darwin ko riject kar sakate hai
 If you want, you can declare Ganesh Pooja as a medical college
 ek hi maalik ke do channel hai
 There are two anchors in the same channel
 ek sampradayikta failaa rahaa he, ek kisaanon kii baat kar rahaa he
 One is spreading lies, one is talking of broken roads
 sawaal, ham jaise sawaal karne vaale se he, jawaab ham jaison ke paas nahin he
 You ask those who bring the media to you, who bring you to India
 phek news aaj oficial news he
 Reporters in the newsroom have finished
 reporter kaa istemaal hatyare ke rup main hota he
 In a channel, four mps sent five reporters together behind one MP
 dekhne se laga ki sara media uske peeche padaa he
 This is the new era
 daraa hua media apane camaron se aapako daraane niklaa he
 The anchors that are inciting communalism on the channels are getting space
 in ankaron ke paas sarkaar ke liye koi sawaal nahin he, sirf ek hi queshchan sabake paas he
 The name of this question is Hindu Muslim Question, HMQ
 bharat ke news ankar rashtrawaad kii aad main sampradayik ho chuke hai
 To the extent that when the youth in Udaipur climb the roof of the court carrying the saffron flag, the anchors are silent
 kya ham aisa bharat chaahate the, chaahate hai? adaalat jis samvidhan ke tahat he, usee samvidhan kii ek dhara se media apni azaadi kaa charnamrita grahan karata he
 Charanamrit must have understood
 garvanment of media ke paas ek hi agenda he
 Hindu Muslim Question
 isse jude phek news kii itani bharmaar he ki aap alt news dot in par pard sakate hai
 Now fake news has started being made from the other side
 My dear friends, believe me, Media is trying to murder our hard earned democracy
 Our Media is a murderer
 yah samaaj main aisa asantulan paidaa kar rahaa he, apni bahason ke zarie aisa zehar bo rahaa he jisase hamaare loktantr ke bheetar bhay kaa maahaul bana rahe
 Which triggers a rush anytime anywhere and overpowers you
 aap kahenge ki kya itnaa bura he, kuch bhi acha nahin he
 i know you like positive poses from time to time
 ek positive bataata hum
 India's democracy is not bent by the media's bowing down
 vah media ke mit jane se nahin mit jayega
 He neither bowed in emergency nor he would bow during the era of dock media
 bharat kaa loktantr hamaari aatma he
 We have a conscience
 aatma amar he
 You can read the Gita
 main garvanment of media kii baat kar rahaa hum
 Like you, i also dream about India
 magar jaagate hue
 The reality in front of me is a dream
 main ek aise bharat kaa sapana dekhtaa hum jo hakeekat kaa saamana kar sake
 Think about why we are entangled in questions of the past these days
 agar in sawaalon kaa saamana hi karnaa he to kya ham thik se kar rahe hai, kya in sawaalon kaa saamana karne kii jagah tivi kaa studio he? yaa classroom he, conference room hai, or saamana ham kis tarah se karenge, kya ham aaj hisaab karenge, kya ham aaj qatleam karenge? to kya aap apane ghar se ek hatyara dene ke liye taiyaar hai? nafrat kii yah aandhi har ghar main ek hatyara paidaa kar jaaegi, wo aapkaa bhai ho saktaa he, betaa ho saktaa he, dost ho saktaa he, padosi ho saktaa he, kya aapane man bana liya he? kya hamane siikhaa he ki itihaas kaa saamana kaise kiya jaae? ham class room main nahin, sadak or tivi studio main itihaas kaa hisaab karne nikle hai
 You do not change history by making Nehru a Muslim or by defeating Akbar, when history starts to change by the order of the Minister of Education, then understand that he would not have been a good student of the Chemistry
 kya aap yahaan harvard main baithkar is baat ko sweekaar kar sakate hai ki itihaas ke class room main koi mantri aakar itihaas badal de
 Take the book from the professor's hand and give it to read
 kya aap bardaasht karenge? jab aap khud ke liye yah bardaasht nahin kar sakate to bharat ke liye kaise kar sakate hai? There must be a new debate in history, there should be new research
 lekin ham vaisaa kar rahe hai
 We have debated for three months on a film
 itani bahes hamane bharat kii garibi par nahin kii, bharat kii sambhaavnaaon par nahin kii, hamane teen maheene ek film par bahes kii
 People came to the studio with swords, now someday will bring guns
 maharana kii haar ke baad bhi logon ne mahaan vijeta ke rup main sweekaar kiya tha
 His heroic saga had no effect on the defeat which an Education Minister tried to replace with his strength
 lok shrutiyon main aparaajey maharana ke liye kitabon main badi haar he
 i do not think that brave soldiers like Maharana Pratap would have been happy to write victory instead of defeat
 jo vir hota he wo haar ko bhi gale lagaataa he
 But it is true that the public does not understand the history as it is in the class room
 class room main bhi baari asamnata he
 Millions of students of history did not get good books, teachers could not find them, so they took the garbage in place of books
 kooday ko itihaas samaj liya
 Even today, we do not understand history without pride and pride
 sone kii chidiya tha hamaara desh
 The country was the world master
 ye sab visheshan hai, itihaas nahin he
 SUPERLATIVES CANT BE HISTORY
 vaise is teen maheene main bharat me jitne itihaaskaar paidaa hue hai, utane oxford or cambridge apane kai sau saal ke itihaas main paidaa nahin kar paae honge
 In India, you can become a historian just by burning, tearing posters
 kisi film kaa pradarshan rukvaa kar aap itihaaskaar ban sakate hai
 For the historians we have produced in three years, now we do not even have that much diversity
 angrezon kii kalpana thi ki bharat ke itihaas ko hindu itihaas muslim itihaas main badal do
 Today many people are fulfilling the idea of english rule
 wo waapas itihaas ko hindu banaam musalmaan ke khaanche main le ja rahe hai
 To cover the present, issues are being brought from history through which the religious identity of the citizen and voter can be created
 ham kyon apni bhartiyata kabhi anekta main ekta main khojate khojate, dharmik ekarupata main khojane lagate hai? ham samvidhan se apni pahchaan kyon nahin hasil karte, jiske liye hamane sau saal kii ladaai ladi
 Argued day and night, millions of people went to jail
 agar bahuton ko lagata he ki is sawaal par bahes honi chahie to kya ham sahi tareeke se apane sawaal rakh rahe hai, bahes kar rahe hai, kya uskaa manch akhbaar tak na padhane vaale ye ankar honge
 After all, why does the majority religion want to impose religious interpretation on the characters of history? Once our Indianness was found in the media space, my voice was made with yours, today our tone is ours, your note is yours or your tone is nothing, our voice is yours
 ham bharatiyon kaa bhartiya hone kaa bodh or itihaas bodh donon sankat se guzar rahaa he
 We are being prepared with a sense of a fragmented citizenship
 jiske bheetar phek news or phek history ke zarie aisi politicil programing kii ja rahi he ki kisi bhi shahar main chote chote samooh main logon ko trigar kiya ja saktaa he
 Can you avenge history, then you are going against the basic concept of justice which says that blood is not revenge blood
 agar ham khun kaa badla khun kii avadharana par jaaenge to hamaare chaaron taraf hinsa hi hinsa hogi
 There are two types of political identity in India at this time
 ek jo dharmik aakraamakata se las he or doosraa to dharmik aatmavishvaas kho chukaa he
 One is intimidating and frightened
 yah asantulan aane vaale samay main hamaare saamne kai chunautiyaan laane vaala hai jinhen ham koob pahachaanate hai
 We have seen its consequences, we also pay
 alag-alag samay par alag-alag samudaayon ne bhugte hai
 Old wounds are not erased from our memories that we bring new wounds
 jaise hindustan ek tu in van desh he
 Which has been recognized as India and India in our official tongue
 usee tarah hamaari pahchaan dharm or jati ke tu in van par aadhaarit he
 You look at India from these caste organizations, you will not be able to see its face in front of everyone
 aap jati kaa cheharaa chupake se ghar jaakar dekhte hai
 We did not end caste
 hamane azaad bharat main nai nai CAST COLONIES banaai hai
 These belong to CAST COLONIES CONCRETE
 iske mukhiya us aadhunik bharat main paidaa hue log hai
 Ask yourself why these castes are becoming colonies in society today
 aaj kaa matlab 2018 nahin or na hi 2014 he
 We pride India, pride of religion, pride of caste
 ham apane bheetar har tarah kii krurta ko bachaate rahanaa chaahate hai
 Is caste really a matter of pride? If the answer to this question is yes, then we are cheating with the Constitution, betraying the spirit of our national movement
 team india kaa raajnneetik slogan cast india, religen india main badal chukaa he
 a cooperative society of Brahmins has been formed in Andhra Pradesh
 iskaa mishan he brahmanon kii viraasat ko dobaaraa se jivit karnaa or use aage badhanaa
 What is the heritage of Brahmins, what is the heritage of Rajputs? Then what is the problem with Bhima Koregaon, the legacy of Dalits? Then what is the problem with the legacy of the Mughals, where the Israeli head of state also wants to spend two moments with his wife

 These anchors have no question for the government, only one question is with everyone
 is sawaal kaa naam he hindu muslim queshchan, HMQ
 India's news anchors have become communal under the guise of nationalism
 is had tak ki jab udaipur main noujvaan bhagava jhanda lekar adaalat kii chat par chadh jate hai to ankar chup ho gaye hai
 Did we want such an India, want it? The constitution under which the court is under the same constitution, the media assumes the phase of its independence
 charnamrita to samajhate honge
 The Government of Media has the same agenda
 hindu muslim queshchan
 There is so much of fake news related to it that you can read on Alt News
com
 ab to phek news duusari taraf se banane lage hai
 My dear friends, believe me, media is trying to murder our hard earned democracy
 Our Media is a murderer
 It is creating such an imbalance in the society, through its debates, is poisoning such a poison that creates an atmosphere of fear within our democracy
 jisase ek bheed kabhi bhi kahin bhi trigar ho jaati he or aapako overpavar kar detii he
 You would say what is so bad, nothing is good
 mujhe pataa he ki aapako bich bich main positive acha lagata he
 i will tell you a positive bharat kaa loktantr media ke jhuk jane se nahin jhuk jaataa he
 It will not disappear as media is lost
 vah na to apatkaal main jhukaa na vah godi media ke kaal main jhukegaa
 The democracy of India is our soul
 hamaara zamir he
 The soul is immortal
 aap gita pard sakate hai
 i am talking about the Government of Media
 aapaki tarah main bhi bharat ko lekar sapane dekhtaa hum
 But while awake saamne kii hakeekat hi mere liye sapana he
 i dream of an India that can face reality
 sochie zaraa ham aaj kal ateet ke sawaalon me kyon uljhe hai
 If we have to face these questions, then are we doing properly, is there a TV studio instead of facing these questions? Or is it a classroom, a conference room, and how will we face it, will we calculate today, will we commit murder today? So are you ready to deliver a killer from your home? This storm of hate will create a killer in every house, it can be your brother, can be a son, can be a friend, can be a neighbor, have you made up your mind? Have we learned how to face history? We are out in the class room, not in the street and TV studios to calculate history
 nehru ko musalmaan bana dene se yaa akbar ko parajeet bana dene se aap itihaas nahin badal dete, itihaas jab shiksha mantri ke aadesh se badalane lage to samajhie ki vah mantri chemistry kaa bhi acha vidhyaarthee nahin rahaa hoga
 Can you accept sitting here at Harvard and change the history by having a minister come to the class room of history
 professor ke haath se kitaab lekar, apni kitaab padhane ke liye de de
 Will you tolerate How can you do it for India when you can't afford it for yourself? zarur itihaas main nai bahes chalani chahie, nae shodh hone chahie
 But we are doing so
 ek film par hamane teen maheene bahes kii he
 We did not debate so much on India's poverty, did not debate India's prospects, we debated a film for three months
 talavaarein lekar log studio main aa gaye, ab kisi din bandooken lekar aaenge
 Even after the defeat of Maharana, people were accepted as great conquerors
 unki veerta kii gaatha par us haar kaa koi asar hi nahin tha, jise ek shiksha mantri ne apni takat se badalane kii koshish kii
 There is a big defeat in books for the unbeatable Maharana in folk legends
 mujhe nahin lagata ki maharana pratap jaise bahadur kaagaz par haar kii jagah jeet likh dene se khush hote
 The one who is brave also embraces defeat
 par yah sahi he ki public main itihaas ko lekar waisi samaj nahin he jaisi class room main he
 There is heavy disharmony in the class room as well
 itihaas ke lakhon chaatro ko acchhee kitaaben nahin milin, shikshak nahin mili isliye sabane kitaab kii jagah kooda uthaa liya
 Litter understood history
 ham aaj bhi itihaas ko gaurav gaan or gaurav bhav ke bina nahin samaj pate hai
 The gold bird was our country
 vishwa guru tha desh
 These are all adjectives, not history
 SUPERLATIVES CANT BE HISTORY
 However, the number of historians born in India in this three months, Oxford and Cambridge could not have been born in their history of several hundred years
 bharat main aap bas jalaakar, poster fadkar itihaaskaar ban sakate hai
 You can become a historian by stopping the performance of a film
 teen saal main hamane jinte itihaaskaar paidaa kiye hai, unke liye ab hamaare paas utani universti bhi nahin hai
 It was the imagination of the British to convert the history of India to Hindu history into Muslim history
 aaj bahut se log angrezi hukumat kii soch ko puraa kar rahe hai
 They are taking history back into the mold of Hindu versus Muslim
 vartmaan par pardaa daalane ke liye itihaas se vaise mudde laae ja rahe hai jinke zarie naagarik kaa, matadaata kaa dharmik pahchaan banaai ja sake
 Why do we ever seek our Indianness in unity in diversity, in religious uniformity? Why don't we get our identity from the Constitution, for which we fought for a hundred years
 din raat bahes kiye, lakhon log jail gaye
 If many feel that this question should be debated, are we rightly placing our questions, arguing, will these forums be the anchors not reading the newspaper
 akhir kyon bahusankhyak dharm itihaas ke kirdaaron par dharmik vyakhya thopanaa chahta he? kabhi media ke spes main hamaari bhartiyata mili sur meraa tumhaara se banati thi, aaj hamaara sur hamaara, tumhaara sur tumhaara yaa tumhaara sur kuch nahin, hamaara hi sur tumhaara
 We Indians are going through both a crisis and a sense of being an Indian
 hamen ek khandit naagarikta ke bodh ke saath taiyaar kiye ja rahe hai
 Within which such political programming is being done through fake news and fake history that people can be triggered in small groups in any city
 kya aap itihaas kaa badla le sakate hai to phir aap nyaay kii mul avadharana ke khilaaf ja rahe hai jo kahata he ki khun kaa badla khun nahin hota he
 If we go to the concept of blood revenge, then violence will be violence all around us
 is samay bharat main do tarah ke polytical aaidentity hai
 One who is armed with religious aggression and the other has lost religious confidence
 ek daraane vaala he or daraa hua he
 This imbalance is going to bring many challenges in front of us which we recognize very well
 hamane iske nattejey dekhe hai, bhugte bhi hai
 Different communities pay at different times
 hamaari smritiyon se puraane zakhm mitate bhi nahin ki ham nae zakhm le aate hai
 Like India is a two in one country
 jise hamaari sarkari jubaan main india or bharat ke rup main pahchaan mil chuki he
 In the same way, our identity is based on two in one religion and caste
 aap in jati sanghathanon kii taraf se bharat ko dekhie, aap uskaa cheharaa sabake saamne dekh nahin paaenge
 You see the face of the caste secretly at home
 hamane jati ko khatm nahin kiya
 We have created new new CAST COLONIES in free India
 ye CAST COLONIES CONCRETE kii hai
 Its head is a people born in that modern India
 puuchhie khud se ki aaj kyon samaaj main ye jati coloni ban rahi hai
 Today does not mean 2018 nor 2014
 ham bharat kaa gaurav karte hai, dharm kaa gaurav karte hai, jati kaa gaurav karte hai
 We want to save all the cruelty within us
 kya jati vaaki gaurav karne kii chiz he? is sawaal kaa jawaab agar haa he to ham samvidhan ke saath dhokhaa kar rahe hai, apane rashtriya andolan kii bhaavana ke saath dhokhaa kar rahe hai
 The political slogan of Team India has changed to Cast India, Religion India
 andhra pradesh main brahn jati kii ek koparative sosayadi bani he
 Its mission is to revive and carry forward the legacy of Brahmins
 brahmanon kii viraasat kya he, rajputon kii viraasat kya he? to phir daliton kii viraasat bhima koregaanv se kya dikkat he? phir mughalon kii viraasat se kya dikkat he jahaan israel ke raashtra pramukh bhi apni patni ke saath do pal guzaarana chaahate hai

 Go to com
 mukhyamantri chandra babu naidu isaki patrika laanch kar rahe hai kyonki is sosayadi kaa mukhiya unki party kaa sadsy he
 The goals of this society are what the government should have
 jo hamaari aarthik nitiyon ke hone chahie
 Are our policies failing so much that now we have started making our own castes cooperative
 iskaa lakshya he garib brahman jatiyon kaa self helf group bananaa, unhen bijness karne, gaadi kharidne kaa lone dena
 Its members can only be from the Brahmin community
 iees hai, peshewar log hai
 Its chairman Anand Surya is also a Brahmin
 apana parichay main khud ko trade union netaa or bijnesaman likhte hai
 Business men rarely become trade union leaders in the world
 ve bijepi, bhartiya mazdoor sangh, janata dal, samaajawaadee janata party, janata dal secular main rah chuke hai
 Where he has learned how to give moral and political support to the Brahmin community
 hamen pataa hi nahin tha samaajawaadee party main log ye sab bhi sikhte hai
 He has been in TDP since 2003
 yah akelaa aisa santhaan nahin he
 Many such caste organizations are established in foreign countries as well as in India
 inke adhyakshon kii raajnneetik haisiyat kisi netaa se adhik he
 Without this space it is impossible to become a leader without such identification
 bangaloru main to 2013 main sirf brahmanon ke liye vaidic sosayadi banani shuru ho gai thi
 Think a township is only of Brahmins
 ye excluzan hamen kahaan le jayega, kya yah ek tarah kaa gheto nahin he
 2700 houses will be separate from Brahmins
 ye to phir se gaanvon vaala system ho jayega
 Of Brahmins separately
 kya yah gheto nahin he? Why did this happen in free India? When the housing society expanded in the eighties, it was settled on the basis of caste and particular profession
 dilli main patpadganj he, vahaan par jati, pesha, ilaaka or rajya ke hisaab se kai houseing sosayadi aapako milegi
 Then how were we becoming Indians based on the Constitution
 kya bina jati ke samarthan ke ham bhartiya nahin ho sakate
 There are different hostels of castes in Vidyanagar, Jaipur
 shri rajput sabha ne apni jati ke ladakon ke liye hostel banaae hai
 They also have girls
 yadavon ke bhi alag hostel hai
 Meena caste also has separate hostels
 brahman jati ke bhi alag hostel hai
 Now you tell me, whoever goes beyond these hostels will put forward their identity within themselves
 kya uski pahchaan kaa samvidhan aadhaarit bhartiyata se takaraav nahin hoga? khatic chatrawas bhi he jo sarkaar ne banaae hai
 Why did state governments need to create separate hostels for Dalits? Has the upper strata of our castes not yet accepted India on the basis of the constitution, does it not like constitution-based citizenship? Is there any group of castes that want to regain their supremacy with the help of religion? Is there any group that is now challenging this domination with many times more power than before? bharat kii raajnneeti kii tarah media bhi inhen cast colony se aata he
 Its editors also come from the same cast colony
 unhen public main jati kii pahchaan thik nahin lagati magar unhen dharm kii pahchaan thik lagati he
 That is why they are promoting the identity of caste through the identity of religion
 yah kaam vahi kar saktaa he jo loktantr main yakeen nahin rakhata ho kyonki jati loktantr ke kilaaf he
 All is not well in the Government of Media
 positive yahi he ki loktantr ke kilaaf yah puri azaadi se bol rahaa he
 Is speaking freely against brotherhood
 hamaari garvanment of media azaad he
 Free than ever
 isi positive note par main apana bhaashan samaapt kar rahaa hum
 Overall, we are promoting the status quo
 dharm ke gaurav ko ham raashtra bataa rahe hai
 If you wish, you can reject Darwin
 aap chahen to ganesh puja ko hi medical college kii padhai ghoshit kar sakate hai
 My dear friends, believe me, media is trying to murder our hard earned democracy
 Our Media is a murderer
 It is creating such an imbalance in the society, through its debates, is poisoning such a poison that creates an atmosphere of fear within our democracy
 jisase ek bheed kabhi bhi kahin bhi trigar ho jaati he or aapako overpavar kar detii he
 You would say what is so bad, nothing is good
 mujhe pataa he ki aapako bich bich main positive acha lagata he
 i will tell you a positive bharat kaa loktantr media ke jhuk jane se nahin jhuk jaataa he
 It will not disappear as media is lost
 vah na to apatkaal main jhukaa na vah godi media ke kaal main jhukegaa
 The democracy of India is our soul
 hamaara zamir he
 The soul is immortal
 aap gita pard sakate hai
 i am talking about the Government of Media
 aapaki tarah main bhi bharat ko lekar sapane dekhtaa hum
 But while awake saamne kii hakeekat hi mere liye sapana he
 i dream of an India that can face reality
 sochie zaraa ham aaj kal ateet ke sawaalon me kyon uljhe hai
 If we have to face these questions, then are we doing properly, is there a TV studio instead of facing these questions? Or is it a classroom, a conference room, and how will we face it, will we calculate today, will we commit murder today? So are you ready to deliver a killer from your home? This storm of hate will create a killer in every house, it can be your brother, can be a son, can be a friend, can be a neighbor, have you made up your mind? Have we learned how to face history? We are out in the class room, not in the street and TV studios to calculate history
 nehru ko musalmaan bana dene se yaa akbar ko parajeet bana dene se aap itihaas nahin badal dete, itihaas jab shiksha mantri ke aadesh se badalane lage to samajhie ki vah mantri chemistry kaa bhi acha vidhyaarthee nahin rahaa hoga
 Can you accept sitting here at Harvard and change the history by having a minister come to the class room of history
 professor ke haath se kitaab lekar, apni kitaab padhane ke liye de de
 Will you tolerate How can you do it for India when you can't afford it for yourself? zarur itihaas main nai bahes chalani chahie, nae shodh hone chahie
 But we are doing so
 ek film par hamane teen maheene bahes kii he
 We did not debate so much on India's poverty, did not debate India's prospects, we debated a film for three months
 talavaarein lekar log studio main aa gaye, ab kisi din bandooken lekar aaenge
 Even after the defeat of Maharana, people were accepted as great conquerors
 unki veerta kii gaatha par us haar kaa koi asar hi nahin tha, jise ek shiksha mantri ne apni takat se badalane kii koshish kii
 There is a big defeat in books for the unbeatable Maharana in folk legends
 mujhe nahin lagata ki maharana pratap jaise bahadur kaagaz par haar kii jagah jeet likh dene se khush hote
 The one who is brave also embraces defeat
 par yah sahi he ki public main itihaas ko lekar waisi samaj nahin he jaisi class room main he
 There is heavy disharmony in the class room as well
 itihaas ke lakhon chaatro ko acchhee kitaaben nahin milin, shikshak nahin mili isliye sabane kitaab kii jagah kooda uthaa liya
 Litter understood history
 ham aaj bhi itihaas ko gaurav gaan or gaurav bhav ke bina nahin samaj pate hai
