 The government has not considered the need to count how many people have AIDS in our country after 2009
 
 
 aise main jo aankade mere paas hai, ve shaayad aaj sahi na hon, phir bhi inhen bataakar hamen to apana farz puraa karnaa hi he
 
 
 So, according to government data, 23 in our country
 9 lakh logon ko yaa to aids he yaa phir ve echivi positive hai
 
 
 In such a situation, when i read in the newspaper that the Food and Drugs Administration in America has now approved the 'over the Counter Home HIV Test', i was in a dilemma
 
 
 kya yah bharat ke liye bhi ek acha vikalp hoga
 
 
 The aakhir jis desh ke naagarik garbhanirodhak tak kharidne main sharmaate hai, vahaan kya log apni is beemaari kii jaanch karaane jate bhi hai
 
 
 In such a situation, if you get any direction by sitting at home, then what is the harm in this? 
 
 lekin phir mujhe yaad ai ek or khabar, jo maine kuch din pehle padhi thi
 
 
 An AIDS sufferer, who was once an auto driver in Mumbai, committed suicide two days ago and on his way out revealed his wife's illness
 
 
 tab maine sochaa ki is insaan kii koi majaburiyaan rahi hongi - aarthik tangi, saamaajik bahishkaar, depressant yaa aatm−glani - lekin sawaal uthta tha, yah shaks apni patni kaa baaki jivan kyon barbaad kar gaya
 
 
 He was left destitute, the disease which he may have given to his wife himself, he was also told to the whole society
 
 
 ab us mahila ke paas kya chaara rah jaataa he
 
 
 In such a situation, the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) suggests that such victims should not take any wrong step
 
 
 meraa sawaal he ki yadi kisi insaan ko apane ghar main bina kisi counselling saport ke apane aids se grasit hone kaa pataa chalata he, to kya uski maansik haalat aisi hogi ki vah apni is sthiti ko samaj sake or apane bhavishya ke liye kuch soch sake
 
 
 i do not want to give an opinion against any test or in favor, but i want to raise both questions
 
 
 shaayad ghar kii privesi main kiye gaye test se ab se zyada logon main is beemaari ke liye apni jaanch karaane kii razaamandi paidaa ho jaae, or usase vakt rahete logon ko ilaaj mil sake
 
 
 But at the same time, the other difficulty is whether after knowing about the disease, they will raise their hands towards the right help, or they will silently choose the wrong path for fear of society
 
 
 tippaniyan a plea can also be given that everything should be a choice
 
 
 agar hamaare desh main duniya ke kai viksit deshon ke mukaable, jivan ke har pahalu main chunane kaa haq he, to phir yahaan kyon nahin
 
 
 Every person has the right to choose whether he wants a test at home or not
 
 
 jise nahin karnaa, vah kit na kharide
 
 
 Well, the arguments are many
 
 
 philhal yah test america main hi viksit hua he, or NACO ne pehle hi ise bharat laane se manaa kar diya he
 
 
 But i raise the question without any bias - is this decision right? 
 
 ? In such a situation, when i read in the newspaper that the Food and Drugs Administration in America has now approved the 'over the Counter Home HIV Test', i was in a dilemma
 
 
 kya yah bharat ke liye bhi ek acha vikalp hoga
 
 
 The aakhir jis desh ke naagarik garbhanirodhak tak kharidne main sharmaate hai, vahaan kya log apni is beemaari kii jaanch karaane jate bhi hai

 ? After all, in the country where the citizens are shy about buying contraceptives, do people even go to get their disease checked
 
 
 kya aise halaat main ghar par hi baithkar agar aapako koi disha mil jaae to isamen harz hi kya he
 
 
 But then i remembered another news, which i had read a few days ago
 
 
 ek aids peedit, jo kabhi mumbai main autochaalak tha, ne do din pehle hi khudakushi kii or jate-jate apane khat main apni patni kii beemaari kaa khulaasa bhi kar gaya
 
 
 Then i thought that this man must have had some compulsions - financial constraints, social exclusion, depression or self-guilt - but the question arises, why did this man ruin the rest of his wife's life
 
 
 use besahaara to chhod hi gaya, jo beemaari shaayad usne khud hi apni patni ko di ho, vah saare samaaj ko bataa bhi gaya
 
 
 Now what choice does that woman have left
 
 
 aise main is tarah ke peedit koi galat kadam na uthaa len, uske liye neshnal aids control organizeshan (NACO) kaa suzav he - counselling
 
 
 My question is that if a person finds himself suffering from AIDS in his home without any counseling support, will his mental condition be such that he can understand his condition and think something for his future
 
 
 main kisi bhi test ke khilaaf yaa paksh main raay nahin dena chaahati, lekin donon tarah ke sawaal khadey karnaa chaahati hum
 
 
 Probably a test done in the privacy of the house will allow more people to get their tests done for this disease than now, and people can get treatment in time
 
 
 lekin vahiin duusari mushkil yah he ki kya rog ke bare main jaanane ke baad ve log sahi madad kii taraf haath badhayenge, yaa samaaj ke dar se chupchaap koi galat raah chun lenge
 
 
 The comments ek daleel yah bhi di ja sakati he ki har chiz kii chwis honi chahie
 
 
 If our country has the right to choose in every aspect of life, than many developed countries of the world, then why not here
 
 
 har insaan ko chunane kaa haq ho ki vah ghar par test chahta he yaa nahin
 
 
 Those who do not, do not buy the kit
 
 
 khayr, daleelein bahut hai
 
 
 The test is currently developed in the US, and NACO has already refused to bring it to India
 
 
 lekin main bina kisi pakshpaat ke sawaal uthaati hum - kya yah faisla sahi he
 
 
 The tab maine sochaa ki is insaan kii koi majaburiyaan rahi hongi - aarthik tangi, saamaajik bahishkaar, depressant yaa aatm−glani - lekin sawaal uthta tha, yah shaks apni patni kaa baaki jivan kyon barbaad kar gaya
 
 
 He was left destitute, the disease which he may have given to his wife himself, he was also told to the whole society
 
 
 ab us mahila ke paas kya chaara rah jaataa he
 
 
 In such a situation, the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) suggests that such victims should not take any wrong step
 
 
 meraa sawaal he ki yadi kisi insaan ko apane ghar main bina kisi counselling saport ke apane aids se grasit hone kaa pataa chalata he, to kya uski maansik haalat aisi hogi ki vah apni is sthiti ko samaj sake or apane bhavishya ke liye kuch soch sake
 
 
 i do not want to give an opinion against any test or in favor, but i want to raise both questions
 
 
 shaayad ghar kii privesi main kiye gaye test se ab se zyada logon main is beemaari ke liye apni jaanch karaane kii razaamandi paidaa ho jaae, or usase vakt rahete logon ko ilaaj mil sake
 
 
 But at the same time, the other difficulty is whether after knowing about the disease, they will raise their hands towards the right help, or they will silently choose the wrong path for fear of society
 
 
 tippaniyan a plea can also be given that everything should be a choice
 
 
 agar hamaare desh main duniya ke kai viksit deshon ke mukaable, jivan ke har pahalu main chunane kaa haq he, to phir yahaan kyon nahin
 
 
 Every person has the right to choose whether he wants a test at home or not
 
 
 jise nahin karnaa, vah kit na kharide
 
 
 Well, the arguments are many
 
 
 philhal yah test america main hi viksit hua he, or NACO ne pehle hi ise bharat laane se manaa kar diya he
 
 
 But i raise the question without any bias - is this decision right?

 In the film, Shahid raises his voice against this misconception

 (input language) marxvaadi communist party (CPM) ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki uttar pradesh main sampradayik takatein lagaataar tanaav paidaa karne ke liye sajishein rach rahi hai
 The CPM alleged that RSS and BJP people want to take electoral advantage in the 2017 state assembly elections in the state by creating an atmosphere of tension in the society by carrying out such incidents
 CPM ke pradesh rajya sachiv mandal kii baithak main rajya sachiv heeralaal yadav ne chintaa jataate karte hue kaha ki sampradayik tatwon dwaara maamuli ghatnaon par saamaanya baton ko tool dekar hinsaatmak ghatnaayen kii ja rahi hai
 It has been tried in many cities including Hathras, Deoband and Bareilly
 unhone kaha ki duusari ore alpsankhyakon ke bich main meerut ke haji yaqub kuraishi jaise log paris main hui patrakaron kii hatya ke sambandh main ool-jalul bayaanbaji kar apni lokapriyata badhanaa chaahate hai
 Yadav appealed to the people not to fall prey to the communal forces and requested the state government to take strict action against such communal elements and forces
 ---input IANS se The way the Chief Minister of Shimla, Himachal Pradesh Jairam Thakur has thrown out almost the entire team including the bureaucracy of the Chief Minister's office in less than five months, it is clear that Thakur needs the results on the ground
 lekin aisa karne se pehle vah na sirf pradhanmantri narendra modi balki party adhyaksh amit shah se mulaakaat karke laute balki party ke anya varisht jajon ko vishwaas main lete hue apni phulfarm main aae hai
 The BJP government wants to push the party towards the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and show it a tax that will keep the lotus burning ahead
 isliye afasaron kii chust-darust, mustaid va eemaandaar team kaa gathan karke morche par datane kaa khaakaa mukhyamantri ne khud taiyaar kiye
 Leaving aside the tantrums of one or two officers, in the case of the rest, the Chief Minister has given a direct message that no result should be wrapped, but results will have to be given
 loksabhaa kii parfarmens hi nahin balki apane paanch saal ke kaarykaal main nayab kism kii chhavi logon ke dilon main pade iske liye afasaron kii team ko apane saath 16 ghante kadamon par rakhaa he
 Jayaram made changes in the departments of more than a dozen people
 lekin sabase pehle safai apane daftar main kii
 Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister, Principal Chief Secretary Manisha Nanda was not only removed from the post of Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister but also took the large Environment, Tourism, Information and Public Relations Department with him
 lekin asies shrikant baldi jinke paas ek dashak se zyada tak vitt kaa jimmaa rahaa, ko pradhan sachiv to banaaya lekin manisha kii tarah koi anya vibhaag nahin diya
 Humble by nature, Jairam picked up the delicate tantrums of some officers and gave them excellent portfolios, which made the word 'strictness' melt in his functioning
 personal, grih vibhaag sameta or bhi vibhaag badal die
 Departments like TCP, PWD, Revenue, Agriculture were also completely reshuffled
 sutron ke mutabik jairam ne rosemara kii filon main ho rahi letlatifi ke do kaaran maane hai
 First, the arguments of the officers
 doosraa, afasaron ke apane nihitarth
 The decisions were delayed due to these reasons
 lagbhag dedh maah se jairam parivartan chaah rahe the lekin tamaam feedback or baariki se beuroperesi ko parakhane ke baad hi mukhyamantri ne kadedam faislon main non parfarmaron ko parkhaa
 It is also important that he also took the Governor into confidence in this matter
 unki sanstutiyon ko bhi shaamil kiya
 The present government wants to do a lot in the two sectors of tourism and environment
 lekin engiti ke faislon kaa lagaataar dabaav sarkaar par lagaam lagaae hue he
 It remains to be seen how the Jairam team moves ahead by decree of the court and NGT
 haalanki beuro cretic pherbadal ke baad mukhyamantri ne police par bhi shikanja ksaa he
 It was clearly said in the meeting that you should put the mafia on or else move
 apni eemaandaar chhavi ko barkaraar rakhte hue mukhyamantri afasaron se bhi yahi ummid kar rahe hai
 Chief Minister Jairam Thakur says that this arrangement has been done for better functioning
 aage bhi tabadale kiye ja sakate hai
 He said that strict decisions can be taken where necessary

 If Devendra Fadnavis forms the government by taking the oath of Chief Minister and if the NCP with 54 seats walks out at the time of the vote of confidence, the BJP will easily prove its majority

 a case that seems to be swinging between these two perceptions, which is related to the alleged indecent conduct of the Chief Justice of India, is catching up
 lekin maamle kaa silsilewar byoraa dekha jaae to peedit or uski pidaa se itar bhi kai pahalu najar aaenge jo aaropon par sahaj vishwaas karne se rokte hai
 a woman attached to the staff of the CJI is removed from the job due to complaints of misuse of the CJI office and earning unaccounted benefits
 us mahila ne daftar kii gopneeyata bhang kii or bahari logon se suchanaaen saajha kin
 He was fired in the month of December
 chaar maheene baad us mahila ne sijei par uske saath amaryadit aacharan kaa aarope lagaaya
 For this, he did not complain at any place before
 is ghatnakram kii khabar 19 april main chaar websiton par ai
 However, CJI was not in favor of it
 itnaa hi nahin shikayati ne shapathpatr kii pratiyaan supreme court ke 22 jajon tak bhi bhej deen
 When the matter came to light, the CJI set up an inquiry committee against itself
 is bich utsav bains naamak ek vakil ne supreme court main is maamle se jude kuch sansanikhej khulaase kiye ki iske peeche bade corporates kii lobby kaam kar rahi he jo nyaaypalika par dabaav banane kaa kaam karti he
 The court also listened to him
 cameti banane ke dauraan sijei ne kaha tha nyaaypalika khatre main he or ise torget kiya ja rahaa he
 Appeared before the CJI Committee and presented his stand
 peedit mahila cameti ne cameti ke saamne pesh hone se inkaar kar diya is daleel ke saath ki use nyaay kii ummid nahin he
 Meanwhile, civil society and some lawyers also jumped to get justice for the woman
 do mahila or ek purush nyaayadhish kii teen sadasyeey qameti ne sijeai ko maamle main clin chit de di
 The Supreme Court bench set up a separate committee to investigate the lawyer who had said to be the hand of the corporate lobby
 sijei ko clin chit milane ke khilaaf darjanon mahilaon ne supreme court ke baahar 7 may ko pradarshan kiya
 Obviously people have to gather to perform and this gathering in favor of the clerk level employee seems to be a manageable thing in itself
 nyaayik galiyaaron or vakeelon ke paas aksar aise log ghoomte rahete hai jo maamla bench se set karaane kii baat kehete hai
 a knowledgeable lawyer says that the entire gang of such people operate in and out of the court premises
 ek shabd bench hanting bhi court main bahut chalata he
 There is also talk of big corporates influencing the court process
 farvari ke maheene main ek cese main court order main herpher karne ke aarope main do court master naukari se nikaalkar jail bheje gaye the
 But manipulating the order of the Supreme Court seems unbelievable without incitement and greed
 darasal, adaalat ke bheetar lage keson main daanv bahut oonche hote hai
 In the electoral environment, from the prime minister to the biggest leader of the opposition party, there have been many cases affecting the public
 in maamalon main chote se aadesh se bhi netaaon kii fajihat hoti he or iskaa chunavi asar tak dekhne ko milaat he
 Right now, because there is an electoral atmosphere and the government is also avoiding taking any initiative on its behalf, the matter is cold
 lekin ye to tay he ki sijei par aaropon kaa sira sirf ek mahila se judaa hua he
 The manner in which the complaint was drafting and the combination with which the case was brought up suggests that the matter is bigger than justice to the woman
 aapke man main kuch sahaj sawaal uthenge ki kya supreme court yaa hoicourt ke jaj ke khilaaf exiaar ho sakati he? kya unhen giraftaar kiya ja saktaa he? nahin, na exiaar ho sakati he or na hi giraftaar kyonki supreme court ne hi aisi guidelins tay kii hai ki supreme court or hoicourt jajon ke khilaaf aisi karrwai se pehle sarkaar ko bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish se salaah leni hogi or pukhta bhautik pramaanon ke aadhaar par aage kii karrwai hogi
 The arrest of lower judicial officers will also be symbolic and will be immediately communicated to the District Sessions Judge
 itnaa hi nahin giraftaar kar nichle nyaayik adhikari ko bagaiyr ijaajat thane nahin laayaa ja saktaa
 The Judges Protection Act remains for the independence of the judiciary and under Section 154 of the crpc, judges of higher courts have legal immunity from the FIR but with conditions
 sijei ke khilaaf aarope lagane vaali mahila jaanch se asantusht he
 Everything is not common even in the ranks of judges
 chunaav khatm hone ke baad is maamle main koi nayaa mode aane kii gunjaaish bani hui he kyonki sarkaar kii taraf se ab tak koi pahal nahin hui he
 After this case and even before, the need to maintain cleanliness from the judiciary to the administration remains equal
 iske liye corporates se lekar lobbying karne vaale vakeelon or satta ke dallalon tak par nakel kasne kii jarurat he
 But there is no system to identify them, this is the misfortune of this democracy

 tippaniyan The Chadhi Banyan gang is actually a gang of dreaded dacoits
 jo madhya pradesh ke jhabua, gujarat or maharashtra ke adivasee ilaakon se aate hai
 According to experts, they deliberately do not wear full clothes

 Satinder Sartaj and singer Ginni Mahi attended
 satinder ne kaha- "meraa koi musical becoground nahin rahaa, lekin shuru se hi kuch tha andar jo mujhe mujeec kii ore le gaya
 Poetry can be anyone, but it is a big deal to keep it safe
 main videsh main daancing main bharat kaa pratinidhitiv kar chukaa hum
 The first performance was given in the third class
 " punjabi song ke bol kaa str girane or isaki aalochana hone par satinder ne kaha- "ye badlaav manovaigyanik rup se aayega, na ki jabardasti
 We have run a campaign called Save Youth, Save Punjab
 aap mujeec kii is samasya ko singer or rajanetaaon ke jariye nahin sulajhaa sakate
 We are told that whatever is demanded, it will be made
 ab sab isamen audiyans ke upar hota he
 "ginni Mahi said - my career is just beginning
 main manzil kii taraf badhati ja rahi hum
 My goal is to become a playback singer
 ginni ne aage kaha- main chaahati hum ki meraa har ek gaanaa logon ko koi sandesh de
 There should be a truth and humanity in my songs
 duniya ke har dharm guru kii kahi baton ko main apane gaanon ke jariye kahana chaahati hum
 The message is that there should be unity in the whole world

 Satinder Sartaj said, “artists always need attention
 hamaari yah approach he ki aap jo kahana chaahate hai use kehane se aapako koi roak nahin saktaa
 Secondly, there is no harm in making what is selling
 agar audiyans kuch demand kar rahi he to aap us demand ke aage kuch kar nahin sakate
 Now the world has become a global village

 After registering a historic victory in the assembly elections held in five states, it is now clear that the next President and Vice President of the country will be the choice of BJP
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi ke varisht netaa laal krishna adwani ko aglaa raashtrapati banaae jane kii atakalein lagaai jane lagi hai
 There were reports that Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself discussed Advani's name in a meeting held in Somnath recently
 haalanki meeting main maujuud tamaam log isse saaf inkaar kar rahe hai
 The meeting of the Somnath Trust was held on March 8, in 1992, LK Advani started the Ayodhya Yatra from Somnath and his charioteer was Modi
 8 march ko somnath trust kii metig somnath main hui jismenarendra modi, bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah, somnath trust ke adhyaksh keshubhai patel, bijepi ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani, purv chif secretary pike lahari ke alaava samiti trust ke do or sadsy shaamil hue
 In this meeting which lasted for about an hour, there was a discussion about Somnath temple and many important decisions were taken but no other issues were discussed
 meeting main nahin hui raashtrapati pad par charchaapurv chif secretary pike lahari ne bataaya ki meeting main somnath trust ke agenda ke alaava kisi bhi duusare mudde ko lekar koi baatcheet nahin hui
 Keshubhai Patel also said that there was no discussion about the presidency in the meeting
 yahaan ye bhi ullekh karnaa jaruri he ki meeting se thik ek din pehle adwani somnath pahunch gaye the
 Despite this he neither reached the stage at the Prime Minister's event nor did he accompany Modi, Keshubhai and Amit Shah to worship at the Somnath temple
 modi or adwanike bich kii dooriyaan ab chhipi baat nahin he
 Therefore, Advani's claim is strong
 Lal Krishna Advani is the senior most leader of the party
 agar unhen raashtrapati banaaya jaataa he to ye unki varishthata kaa sammaan to hoga hi, khud modi or amit shah ke liye bhi ye acha faisla ho saktaa he
 In fact, Modi has become such a big leader in the party that the party is now known by his name instead of BJP
 aise main party ke duusare netaa jinhen modi kaa badhata kad khatak rahaa he wo adwani se milte rahete hai or modi-shah kii shikaayat karte rahete hai
 If Advani is made president, he will get away from these leaders, which would be a good thing for modi-shah because despite being not a member of the parliamentary board, he has to voice his opinion in the party

 On the sp's instructions, the police arrested the accused youths Ganesh and Jogesh and sent them to jail
 lekin jamaanat par jail se reeha hone ke baad ek baar phir donon ne jairam or unke parivaar ko pareshaan karnaa shuru kar diya
 It is alleged that both these youths committed mental torture to the family on the instigation of MLA Vijay Paswan
 peedit bacchee ke pita poornamasi singh ne bataaya kigundaika shikaar hokar ve parivaar sahit siddharthanagar se palaayan hokar dar-dar bhatakane ke liye majaboor hai
 The day after his release from jail, both the accused were harassing the whole family
 dilli main naukari karne kii vajah se unka baar-baar ghar ja paanaa sambhav nahin ho paata he
 The reason for the terror is that because of them the children have left school for two months

 At their instigation, these people are troubling the whole family

 Targeting opponents, Varun said that only the honest party and honest leader can change the picture of Uttar Pradesh
 varun ne anaaj mandi maidan main hajaaron samarthakon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'uttar pradesh main mayawati or mulaayam ke shasankaal main suvyavasthit tareeke se bhrashtachar ko badhaava miltaa he

 Significantly, Varun Gandhi was recently made the national general secretary in Rajnath's new team, since then there have been speculations that BJP has prepared a roadmap to use Varun as a strong weapon in Uttar Pradesh
 
 is bich atakalein yah bhi hai ki varun gandhi ko party is baar sultanpur sansadeey seat se chunaav ladaane kaa man bana chuki he
 After this rally in Bareilly, Varun will now sit on a dharna in Lucknow on May 4

 The BJP national president said these things while addressing the crowd of thousands gathered at Swabhiman rally held at the Grainmandi Maidan in Bareilly
 rajnath ne kaha ki soobe main kanoon kii sthiti badahaal ho gayi he
 In the state, the goons die after the SP and BSP form a government
 rajnath ne kaha ki kendriya jaanch beuro ke dar se sapa or bispi centre ko samarthan de rahe hai
 The SP and the BSP have to come out of this fear
 gauratlab he ki bijepi kii ore se yojit swabhimaan raily main rashtriya adhyaksh ke alaava pradesh adhyaksh lakshmikant vaajapeyi or party ke mahasachiv varun gandhi bhi maujuud the
 During this, SP leader Dharmendra Kashyap along with hundreds of supporters joined BJP
 soobe main girti kanoon vyavastha, mahila utpeedan or ganna kisaanon ke bakaae ke mudde ko lekar bijepi kii ore se yah raily yojit kii gayi thi

 At 40, the process of election of Sarkaryavah started
 madhya kshetra ke ashok soni ko chunaav adhikari banaaya gaya
 Jayanthi Bhai Bhadesia of the western region proposed the name of Bhaiyaji Joshi again for Sarkaryavah, mentioning the work done during Bhaiyaji's tenure
 uske baad jayanti bhai bhadesiya ke prastaav kaa virendra singh parakramaditya, dakshin kshetra rajendran, vitthal ji or umesh chakravarti ne samarthan kiya
 The funny thing is that no candidate other than Bhaiyaji Joshi has submitted his claim and the House of Representatives unanimously selected Bhaiyaji Joshi once again to govern for 3 years
 har teen saal main nagpur main hone vaali baithak main sarkarywah kaa chunaav hota he
 If sources are to be believed, some Sangh leaders wanted that this time in place of Sarkaryavah Bhaiyyaji Joshi, Sahasarkaryavah Datratreya Hosbole should be given the responsibility of Sarkaryavah
 lekin duusari taraf sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat or sangh ke kuch varisht padaadhikari chaahate the ki bhaiyaji joshi ko ek or sarkarywah kaa kaarykaal dena chahie
 Like last time, Bhaiyaji Joshi gave a passionate speech in the election of Sarkaryavah and said that for two times i have been saying that i should be relieved of this responsibility and that young blood should be brought forward
 tab aap logon ne meri baat ko nahin mana lekin is baar maan lijie
 But even after Bhaiyaji Joshi's suggestion, the House of Representatives unanimously elected him as Sarkaryavah
 2015 main pratinidhi sabha kii baithak main sarkarywah ke chunaav ke samay bhaiyaji joshi ke swasth ko lekar sangh ke varisht netaaon ko chintaa thi lekin uske baavjood, unhen hi teesri baar sarkarywah kii jimmedaari saunpi gai thi
 If sources are to be believed, many Sangh leaders believe that if Sahasarakarayavah Datratreya Hosbole was given the responsibility of Sarkaryavah, then the same situation would be born in the time of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani during the time of KC Sudarshan Sangh chief and Mohan Bhagwat Sarkaryavah was
 sudarshan pad main bade jarur the, lekin wo umr or tajurbe main kam the
 This time the Sangh did not want to create such a problem again
 sutron kii maane to dattatreya hosbhole ko sangh ke kai bade netaa isiilie sarkarywah banane ke paksh main nahin the kyonki unka itihaas sangh ke akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad kaa rahaa he or sangh main hameshaa akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad ko ek raajnneetik sanghathan ke taur par hi dekha jaataa he
 Like Dattatreya Hosabole, the history of Madan Das Devi, who was once the associate government of the Union, has also been there
 dattatreya hosbhole kii hi tarah madandas devi main sarkarywah banane kii yogyataayen thim lekin uske baad bhi unhen sarkarywah kii jimmedaari nahin di gai
 If sources are to be believed, a big reason behind not making Dattatreya Hosbole as Sarkaryavah is that he has a good relationship with the Modi government and bjp's contemporary connected leader of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad
 matlab saaf he ki sangh bhale hi parade ke peeche seraajnneetise judaa ho lekin abhi sangh apane do sarvocch padon ko raajnneeti se judaav rakhane vaale apane netaaon ko ye pad nahin dena chahta tha
 Aam Aadmi Party convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has once again requested for an alliance with Rahul Gandhi
 arvind kejariwal ne is baar dilli ke liye nahin balki haryana main haath milaane kii baat kahi he
 Arvind Kejriwal said that the people of the country want to defeat Amit Shah and Modi ji
 agar haryana main jejepi, aap or congress saath ladate hai to haryana kii dason siton par bijepi haaregi
 Arvind Kejriwal has requested Rahul Gandhi to consider it
 desh ke log amit shah or modi ji kii jodi ko haraana chaahate hai
 If JJP, AAP and Congress fight together in Haryana, BJP will lose in ten seats in Haryana
 rahul gandhi ji is par vichaar karen
 It should be noted that a lot of efforts were made by the Aam Aadmi Party to join hands with the Congress in Delhi
 lekin congress ne ise saaf inkaar kar diya
 Due to which, Arvind Kejriwal had said that there was talk of unholy alliance between the two (congress and BJP)
 unhone kaha tha ki congress party ahamkaari ho gai he
 If they had the same attitude, then their candidates would lose their bail
 vahiin isse pehle dilli main congress ke saath gathbandhan par unhone kaha tha ki media main congress kii taraf se lagaataar gathbandhan kii jaankaree aa rahi he
 According to our internal survey, we are winning seven seats without going with the Congress on the issue of full statehood
 ' iske saath hi unhone kaha ki bharat or pakistan ke bich tanaav ke baad hamane poocha ki bijepi ko phayda hoga yaa nuksaan? 56 fisadi logon ne kaha ki nuksaan hoga
 We are saying that before the elections Lafa will get it done

 kisi sarkari bank ke ATM se nakli note nikalne kii khabar to aapane pehle bhi suni hogi, lekin yah shaayad hi kahin suna hoga ki sarkari bank ke ATM graahakon ke saath dhokhaa hi nahin, majaak bhi karne lage hai
 This is exactly what happened in Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh
 ATM se lagaataar teen logon ke nikle nakli note22 april ravivaar ko ek hindi akhbaar ke patrkaar praveen uttam shaam kareeb paanch baje bareli ke subhash nagar ilaake main united bank of india ke atm se 1200 rupee nikaalkar baahar nikal rahe the
 Two notes of five hundred rupees and two hundred rupee notes were generated from the ATM
 haalanki nikaale gaye noton ko apni jeb main rakhane se pehle jab praveen uttam kii najar unamem se ek note par padi to wo hairaan rah gaye
 a note of five hundred rupees inscribed 'indian Entertainment Bank of India' on one side and 'children's Bank of India' on the other side
 praveen ko apni ankhon par yakeen nahin hua or vah soch hi rahe the ki kya kiya jaae? tabhi ek or vyakti ashok pathak paise nikaalane ke liye usee ATM main pahunche
 Ashok Pathak is a retired employee of the Health Department
 praveen atm ke baahar intjaar karne lage ki ashok pathak bhi paise nikaalkar baahar nikalen, taaki yah pataa chal sake ki yah behuda majaak kya sirf unheen ke saath hua he
 Ashok Pathak withdrew four and a half thousand rupees from the ATM
 praveen ne unase kaha ki vah apane noton kii jaanch thik se kar len
 When Ashok Pathak saw his notes properly, two of 500 notes also came out in the same way, which Praveen Uttam was worried about
 ab yah donon log milakar ATM main kisi tisare aadmi ke aane kaa intjaar karne lage, taaki pakke taur par yah check ho sake ki ATM se paanch sau rupee ke jo note nikal rahe hai, usamen kuch gadabad he
 Soon after, Indra Kumar Shukla arrived at the same ATM to withdraw money
 indra kumaar shukla khud banking sector se jude hue hai
 These two people told Indra Kumar without telling him to withdraw money and started making his video on mobile
 donon logon ko laga ki agar ATM se bhartiya manoranjan bank kaa note nikalate hue video ban jaae, to pakkaa saboot ho jayega
 The plan of these two people worked
 indra kumaar shukla ke atm se 1000 upar nikaalte hue puraa video mobile par shoot ho gaya
 This time also two notes of 500 rupees were found out, one of which was fake, on which the entertainment bank of India was printed instead of Reserve Bank of India
 in teenon logon ne sochaa ki ab puure saboot ke saath yah baat bank ke manager ko bataai jaae
 The bank manager was also surprised to see Bachchan Saha, the manager of United Bank of India in Bareilly, narrating his story to the bank manager
 lekin ATM se nikle nakli note bhi saamne the, ek nahin balki teen log isaki gavaahi de rahe the
 The video shoot of this entire incident was also a proof
 isliye inkaar karnaa sambhav nahin tha
 The bank manager asked these three people to file a written complaint
 is par in teenon logon ne isaki shikaayat darja kara di
 On seeing this news spread all around and the news of the Indian Entertainment Bank notes coming out of the United Bank of India's atms came into the news in many TV channels and newspapers
 nakli noton kii khabar kii tah tak pahunchaa aajatkaajtak / india tudene is maamle kii gaharaai se padtaal kii, taaki sachai saamne aa sake
 After talking to the bank's manager and employees, it was found that there are three atms of United Bank of India in Bareilly city
 in teenon ATM main noton ke bharne kaa kaam bank nahin, balki baahar kii ek agency karti he, jiskaa namashachuritrans India Pvt ltdhe
 The company also manages the atms of Citibank, Standard Chartered Bank, American Express Bank, HDFC, Canara Bank, ICICI Bank
 is company kaa saal 2011 main CMS infosystems limited ne adhigrahan kar liya tha
 Bachchan Saha, the manager of Bareilly United Bank of India, told that there is an email communication between the bank and this agency
 ATM main jitne rupayon kii jarurat hoti he, utane rupee bank ginakar is agency ke aadmi ke hawaale kar detaa he or phir uski jimmedaari hoti he ki wo ATM main jaakar paise bhar de
 At most 20 lakh rupees are put into an ATM at a time
 bareli ke jis ATM se nakli note nikle usamen aakhri baar 19 april ko paise bhare gaye the
 That day, an agent named Rahul Mishra from Securitrans India came to the bank and took six lakhs
 bank ke kaisier aniket babu ne yah chah lakh rupee rahul mishra ko ginakar die the
 This included 100 notes of 2000 rupees and 800 notes of 500 rupees
 bank ke manager or kaisier donon kaa kahana tha ki jab ATM bharne vaali agency ke agent ko note die jate hai, to uski puri tareeke se jaanch or ginati kii jaati he
 The agent also gets the notes counted in front of him and before filling in the ATM, the machine checks that all the notes are fine and there are no fake notes in it
 agar noton kii gaddi main ek bhi nakli note hoga, to mashin fouran use pakad legi
 To check this claim of the bank, when the correspondent of Aaj Tak put two fake notes in the bag of notes and tested it in the machine, every time the machine caught the fake note
 test ke liye usee nakli note kaa istemaal kiya gaya, jo praveen uttam or indra kumaar shukla ko ATM se mila tha or jise bank main apane paas jamaa kara liya he
 Did not get an answer from the agency that financed the ATM, but after this, when tried to contact Securitrans India, no one came forward despite repeated attempts
 khud jab bank ke manager ne 19 april ko bank se note le jane vaale rahul mishra ko bank bulaanaa chaha tab bhi koi saamne nahin aayaa
 No answer was found on the phone number of Securitrans India
 shaayad agency ke log maamle ke surkhiyon main aane ke baad saamne aane se batch rahe the
 Surprisingly, Securitrans India Pvt Ltd acquired from the bank
 ke letters pad par bhi galat phone number chapa hua he
 The printed number is 936853488 which has only 9 digits whereas every mobile number has 10 digits
 bank ke atm se nakli note nikalne ke bare main jab hamane kolkata main united bank of india ke head offis main sampark kiya to bank main is maamle main email par apana jawaab bheja
 According to Manish Agarwal, deputy general manager of United Bank of India, the note that the bank gives for inserting into the ATM is thoroughly investigated
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki in teen logon kii shikaayat ke baad isi ATM se jab bache hue saare noton kii jaanch kii gai to usamen se koi or note nakli nahin niklaa
 Despite this, despite these customers' complaints, the bank will conduct a full investigation about this transaction
 is puure maamle kii jaanch karne ke baad yah baat kahi ja sakati he ki naa to ye teenon graahak jhooth bol rahe hai or naa hi bank main ATM main daalane ke liye nakli note diya hoga
 There is every possibility that the mess in the notes occurred between the bank and the ATM, which is the responsibility of the agency distributing the note in the ATM
 yani united bank of india ke atm se bareli main nakli note nikalne kii khabar sahi he
 (with inputs from Krishna Gopal and Arvind Mishra in Bareilly) ek saath bahut-si swasthya beemaa policiyaan lene kaa chalan badhata ja rahaa he
 At the same time, many questions and doubts are also being raised while claiming the amount
 neeche likhe disha-nirdeshon kaa paalan karen or aapke saath koi gadabadi nahin hogi
 Many policies are why the cost of getting treatment in India is constantly increasing and the coverage given under a health insurance scheme may not be enough for the entire expenses
 salaahkaaron kaa kahana he ki kisi badi chikitsa apatsthiti main atirikt swasthya beemaa yojana acha sahaara ban sakati he
 This is because if one insurer rejects a claim, it may be that another insurer accepts the same claim
 lihaaja ek se zyada swasthya beemaa policiyaan khareednaa daavon ke khaarij hone ke kii sthiti main suraksha kaa kaam karata he
 How to make a claim with multiple policies If you have more than one policy (assuming all of them are indemnity-based insurance policies) and the claimed amount is less than the sum assured under all policies, you can file your claim
 For any insurer can choose the company
 agar daawey kii rakam katautiyon or / yaa ko-pe yani sah-bhugtan dhara par vichaar karne ke baad ek policy ke tahat bimit rakam se zyada he, tab bhi aap yah chunaav kar sakate hai ki pehle kis bimakarta ko daawa bheja jaae
 Although the insurer will settle the claim after applying the contribution clause — the claim will be settled in proportion to the sum assured
 misaal ke liye, ho saktaa he kisi ne bimakarta e se 2 lakh rupye kii policy or bimakarta bi se ek or 1 lakh ru
 If the policy is purchased, insurers a and b will dispose of it in the ratio of two-thirds and one-third respectively
 aisi kisi bhi rakam kaa daawa, jiskaa bhugtan ek bimakarta policy kii paabandiyon kii vajah se nahin karata he, duusari policiyon ke tahat kiya ja saktaa he
 But the policy holder cannot get more than the amount spent on treatment
 duusare bimakarta se daawa karte vakt policydharak ko pehle bimakarta ke mul nipataara patr (setlement latter)ke saath dastavejon kii mul pratiyaan pesh kerani hoti hai
 While purchasing a health insurance policy, it is necessary to disclose all the health insurance plans that you have purchased
 yah tab bhi jaruri he jab aap daawey karte hai
 Hiding these details can be tantamount to violation of the terms and conditions of the health insurance scheme and it can be termed as misrepresentation when investigated
 baarik baton ko janerygar aapane ek se zyada swasthya beemaa policy kharid rakhi hai, to harek policy ke niyamon or sharton ko acchhee tarah pard or jaan len
 Find out what the coverage limit is and what to do and what not to do for each policy to settle the claim
 daawa karne ke liye aap pehle koun-si policy chunate hai, yah beemaa kharidne ke baad intjaar kii miyaad, pehle se maujuud bimariyon ke kawarej, adhiktam maujuud kawarej, no-clem bonus or chhot, yadi koi hon, sareekhee baton par aadhaarit hona chahie

 unka kahana he ki maujuuda halaat ko dekhte hue pakistan ke kisi bhi artist kifilmako relies karnaa is samay ek bada khatra sabit ho saktaa he or ve ye khatra mol nahin lenaa chaahate
 Let us tell you that most of the single screen honors are attached to 'cinema Honors and Exhibitors Association of India', in such a situation it is difficult to release the film on single screen theaters
 yahaan tak ki nitin daataar ne yah bhi kaha, 'association chaahati he ki baaki rajyon ke board bhi film ko relies naa karne ke hamaare faisle kaa saath den auraise naa relies hone den
 Apart from this, 430 members of Maharashtra are associated with this association only
 association kaa yah daawa he ki unka goa, gujarat or kolkata ke kuch hisson main bhi acha khaasaa dabadabaa he or unke saath single screen ke alaava kai chote multiplex ke maalik bhi jude hue hai

 It is astonishing to see the stretchers carrying patients near the entrance and exit doors of the Jagannath temple in Puri
 lekin agar kisi bheed bhare din mandir ke praangan main kuch vakt bitaayen to aapako inkaa istemaal dikh jayega
 Amidst the noise, you will see some sevadars bringing an unconscious devotee from within the temple
 yahaan mandir ke garbh grih main baari bheed or andhere main dam ghutana aam baat he
 Every day there are four to five such incidents on crowded days
 agar jagannatha mandir ko bhakton ke liye niraapad or suvidhajanak banane kaa abhiyaan chalaaya jaae to kya uske samarthan main vahi bhaavnaatmak jowar umadega jo kisi duusare mandir banaao abhiyaan main ubala jaataa he?jagannatha mandir hi kyon, desh ke kisi bhi puraane tirth yaa viraasat ko sahejane-sanvaarane main rajnatik murti nirmaan jaisi deewangi nahin dikhti?nai viraasaton kii siyasat par lahalot hone vaale ham log nae mandiron ke liye lard marate hai or puraane mandiron kii bheed main dab-kuchal kar mar jate hai
 Bursting at the neglect of the ancient culture of India, the Indian right wing could not even remove the legacy, but it did something the opposite
 is saal janvari main loksabhaa ne pracheen smarak, puratathvik viraasat kanoon ko sanshodhit karte hue pracheen smarakon ke paas 100 meter tak nirmaan na karne kii shart hataa di
 Despite this, in 2016, the government told the Lok Sabha that 24 monuments under the protection of the Archaeological Survey have gone missing
 inamen mandir or prastar abhilekh bhi shaamil hai
 After changing the law, monuments are allowed to collapse

 hamaare sabhi puraane tirth-mandiron main avyavashtha kaa ambara he
 Except for a few modern temples, most of the temples are in the middle of cities or inaccessible sites and are prone to accidents

 His opulence is enhanced by his devotees
 unke aasapaas ek bharpoor arthvyavastha lahalhati he
 The government makes their gold deposit scheme successful with the gold found in their offerings, but the money from these temples does not help to secure the faith of their devotees
 niyamon se lande-fande is desh main pracheen sthapit or poojit mandiron ke prabandhan ko lekar nitiyaan, vyavasthaaen nahin ban sakin

 The Ministry of Culture gets less than one per cent of the annual budget from the Central Government
 na hamaari aasthaaen niraapad hai or na hi viraasaten surakshit kyonki hamaare rahanuma na to puraane mandiron ko shanti va suvidha ke saath puja ke laayak bananaa chaahate hai or na ateet ke gauravon ko sajaana-sanvarna

 enditivi se baatcheet main unhone kaha he ki apratyaksh karon se milane vaala rajasav ummid se kamjor rahaa he, isse pataa chalata he ki yah (jiesti) kaise shuru or lagu kis tarah kiya gaya he
 He said that efforts are on to fix it continuously

 Geeta Gopinath said that there are many serious crises in the agriculture sector too
 is par bahut kuch karne kii jarurat he
 Geeta Gopinath said that to overcome the crisis of agricultural sector, measures like debt waiver of farmers should not be adopted, instead they should be helped in cash
 lekin iske liye input sabsidi di jaae yah bhi jaruri nahin he
 Let us tell you that Geeta Gopinath is the first woman economic advisor in the International Monetary Fund
 unka bayaan aise samay aayaa he jab khabar aa rahi he ki modi sarkaar kisaanon kii madad ke liye nagad madad dene kaa elaan kar sakati he
 According to the news quoted by Bloomberg, the Modi government is planning to put money in the farmers' account instead of subsidizing them

 Kejriwal, who was present in a public meeting for the first time after the High Court's verdict on Delhi government's supremacy over the Delhi government in the administration of the national capital, sought to know if the 'value' of the vote of a resident of Delhi was higher than that of a citizen of Haryana
 Why less, where the government has 'full power'
 dharmashala se 10 din kii vipashyana se laute mukhyamantri ne kisi raajnneetik dal kaa naam liye or kisi kii sidhi charchaa kiye bagaiyr kaha ki aam aadmi party (aap) purna rajya kaa darja dilaane ke liye kisi bhi had tak jaakar sangharsh jari rakhegi
 After unveiling the statue of Chaudhary Brahm Prakash, the first Chief Minister of Delhi at the state government-run Charak Institute in Kheda Dabur, Najafgarh, Kejriwal said, "why should the vote value of Delhi's citizens be lower than the voters of Haryana?" Why should the government elected by the voters of Haryana have more power than Delhi? This is an insult to the citizens of Delhi, which is wrong
 
 
 yah unki asmita par hamalaa he
 ' mukhyamantri ne kaha ki dilli ke log is desh kaa ek hissaa hai or chunki ham bharat kii rajdhani hai or iskaa matlab he ki hamen barabari kii shakti rakhane kaa zyada adhikaar he, lekin durbhagyavash hamaare voton kaa koi mulya nahin he

 This is the reason that after some time of friendship, there is a fight between the two again

 After the nomination process, there is a battle between the contestants in the house to become the new captain
 captency task ke dauraan siddharsh shukla or aseem riyaj ek baar phir ek duusare ke saath bhid jaaenge or ek duusare ko khari-khoti sunaayenge
 View this post on instagrama post shared by BIGG BOSS (@ biggbossofficial13_) ondec 3, 2019 at 10:36 am PST In the promo of the show going viral on social media, you can see that Bigg Boss will ask to take the names of 2 contestants who Does not deserve to be Captain
 iske liye zyaadaatar gharavaale siddharth shukla kaa naam lenge
 According to him, Siddharsh Shukla has not been able to fulfill the responsibilities of the captaincy properly
 isi dauraan siddharth or vishaal ke bich kaaphi bahes ho jaati he
 After this, Siddharthshukla and Paras Chhabra form a strategy to win the captaincy task with their group, because they do not want to see any member of their opposite team become captain in any situation
 captency task jeetne ke liye sabhi contestants kaaphi josh main task parform karte hai

 After the humiliating defeat of the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections, the controversy within the party is not taking its name
 haar ke baad congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii yogyata par sawaal uthe
 Now a 'communication gap' has been created within the party
 taaja vivaad party kii ek baithak se judaa he jisamen samvadaheenata kaa bada maamla saamne aayaa
 Neither party president Sonia Gandhi attended the meeting, nor vice-president Rahul Gandhi
 darasal, aaj congress kii sansadeey maamalon kii samiti kii baithak honi thi
 Sonia Gandhi was given time at 9
30 am to attend the meeting, while the remaining members were given 10 o'clock
 lekin, sonia gandhi ko 10 baje raashtrapati bhawan janaa tha or yah unka purv nirdhaarit kaarykram tha
 So she could not preside over the meeting
 vahiin, rahul gandhi amethi ke daure par hai
 Therefore, they too could not attend this meeting
 sawaal uthte hai ki kya party ke netaaon ko sonia or rahul ke kaaryakramon kii jaankaree nahin he or koi baithak unke bina kaise yojit kii ja sakati he? Has the genie of the police recruitment scam in the Samajwadi Party (SP) government once again come out? The method of 'uttar Pradesh Police Recruitment and Promotion Board' is pointing in this way
 jaraa baangi dekhen:16 march ko board ne daroga bhartee kaa nateeja ghoshit kiya
 In this, Ajay Kumar Singh Yadav, (roll Number: 412010691), despite being of OBC category, 313
 4167 ank ke saath saamaanya shrenee main chaynit hua dikhaaya gaya
 In reality the normal category cutoff 332
 9167 ank tha
 The board secretly altered the information released on its website on the morning of March 23, when the anger of the candidates erupted over other similar disturbances
 abhi tak keval obisi shrenee ke abhyarthi rahe ajay kumaar singh ko board ne 'swatantraaa sangram senaanee kaa ashrith' (dguef) ke tahat kshaitij aarakshan kaa labhaarthi bataa diya
 (india Today has screen shots of both the results) The question arises that if OBC candidate Ajay Kumar Singh Yadav was selected in the freedom struggle category then why did the board not give the complete information on 16 March? To declare the result of Daroga recruitment Two days after, on 19 March, the board suddenly put the information of selected candidates for medical in soldier and equivalent recruitment on its website
 isamen spasht rup se kaha gaya ki saamaanya varg kii vahi mahila medical ke liye chaynit kii gai he, jise nunatam ank yani cat of 182
 Must have scored more than 5526 marks
 agle din hi mahila abhyarthiyon ne vidhansabha maarg sthit board daftar par dhaava bol diya
 More than two hundred women candidates including Rita Singh of Azamgarh, Sushma Shukla, Lucknow's Dolly Shukla, Prema Pathak did not succeed for the next stage even after scoring more than two hundred marks
 achaanak bavaal bad gaya or puure pradesh main aagjanee, pradarshan hone lage
 Two days later, on 22 March, the board again revised its results
 ab bataaya gaya ki purv ghoshit katof ank 182
 5526 is for general women candidates who are under horizontal reservation of home guard category
 ab anya saamaanya mahila abhyarthiyon ke liye nayaa katof 288
 9353 has been declared
 eta kii rahane vaali kumari baby (role number: 3231751) kaa daawa he ki unhone daud main 100 main se 80 or likhit pariksha main 179 ank praapt kiye the
 Kumari Baby of OBC category got a total of 259 marks, which was 210 in the cutoff category
 6376 se kahin adhik he
 Despite this, they were disqualified for joining the next phase of soldier recruitment process
 ek or abhyarthi, gonda kii mamata verma kahati hai, ''board ne daud or mukchay pariksha ke ank apni website par ghoshit nahin kiye hai
 This is expected to result in large scale manipulation
 '' kumari baby jaise hajaaron abhyarthi katof se adhik ank paane ke baavjood peeche rahe gaye hai
 The functioning of the Uttar Pradesh Police Recruitment and Promotion Board, which is conducting the country's largest recruitment examination with more than 22 lakh applicants for 41,610 posts of constables and equivalent, is now under the scanner
 16 march ko daroga bhartee pariksha kaa parinaam ghoshit hone ke baad abhyarthiyon main failaa asantosh teen din baad sipaahi bhartee pariksha main medical ke liye chaynit abhyarthiyon ke nattejey aane ke saath bhadak uthaa
 Candidates started violent protests across the state (see box)
 mulaayam singh yadav ke pichley kaarykaal main hui 20,000 sipaahiyon kii bhartee 2007 main bispi kii sarkaar aane ke baad ghotaalon ke aaropon or vivaadon main ghir gai thi
 Now once again the stains of disputes have started deepening on the issue of the SP government
 lagaataar badale gaye niyam15 july, 2011 main tatkaaleen bispi sarkaar ne police aarakshi (sipaahi) or pradeshik armd constebulari (piesi) aarakshi ke kul 41,610 padon par bhartee kii prakriya shuru kii thi
 Exactly eight months later, in March 2012, as soon as the ruling of the SP was done, it canceled the recruitment process and started the exercise afresh from 2013
 bispi sarkaar ke dauraan hui police bhartee main abhyarthiyon ke abhilekhon ke satyaapan or medical ke baad likhit pariksha ke ankon ke aadhaar par merit bani thi, lekin akhilesh sarkaar ne pehle praarambhik likhit pariksha rakhi
 This was followed by the main examination
 medical or abhilekhon kii jaanch sabase baad main rakhi gai
 The race standards for female and male candidates were also changed
 pehle sipaahi bhartee kii praarambhik pariksha 27 aktubar, 2013 main prastaavit thi, lekin chaar din pehle prashnptr laa rahe trek ke durghatnagrast ho jane ke baad achaanak pariksha kii tithi do maheene aage badha di gai
 Prateek Dixit, a Hardoi candidate, says, "the board did not give any information as to where the truck crashed and was there any case filed in this case?" This raises doubts
 ''2011 main bispi sarkaar ne 4,010 darogaaon or piesi ke platoon commander kii bhartee prakiya bhi shuru kii thi
 The SP government changed its rules as well, but had to complete the examination on the court's order from the old rules
 bispi pradesh pravaktaa swami prasad maury kehete hai, ''sapa ghotaalon kii sarkaar he
 Vyapam scam is a big scam in police recruitment
 ''solver par khamoshi se ndehestief ne pichley saal sipaahi bhartee kii mukhya pariksha ke dauraan kanpur, bareli, jhaansi, agra or gautamabudgh nagar se aath solver samet dedh darjan logon ko giraftaar kiya tha
 The role of Ashok Kumar Vishnoi gang of Rajasthan came to light in the examination
 iske baad bhartee board ne pehali baar 'biomitric signechar' kii vyavastha kii
 The Solver Gang also broke it
 ve asli abhyarthi ke anguuthe ke nishaan vaali plastic kii jhilli lagaakar pariksha dene aae
 Amit Yadav, a resident of Lucknow, who is involved in the recruitment process, points to a glitch in the main examination
 "in the main examination, the question papers of the side-examinees had the same series of questions
 haalanki yah peeche baithe abhyarthiyon se bhinn thi, lekin peeche ke agal-bagal ke abhyarthiyon kii siries ek hi thi
 This arrangement was suitable for solvers
 '' solveron ke pakade jane ke baad aaj tak bhartee board unki padtaal nahin kar paaya
 Chairman of 'uttar Pradesh Police Recruitment and Promotion Board' V
 ke
 Gupta also denies any information about this
 whitenor par hilaahvalidaroga or sipaahi, donon bhartee parikshaon main oemar shit par whitenor kaa prayog puri tarah varjit tha
 On doing this, the warning to cancel the candidature was written on the OMR sheet of the answer sheet
 bhulvash kisi abhyarthi ne oemar shit par galat uttar bhar diya ho to use badalane kii gunjaaish nahin thi
 Despite this, the sheet with whitener was tested
 hycourt ke aadesh par 24 march ko adaalat ke saamne aisi aath shit pesh kii gayi, jinamein whitenor kaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 After this, the High Court immediately stopped the recruitment process
 hycourt main abhyarthiyon kii pairvi karne vaale vakil shailendra singh kehete hai, ''bhartee board apane hi banaae niyamon kaa paalan nahin kar rahaa
 The board should tell how many sheets were discarded due to the use of Whitener
 '' sapa sarkaar banane ke baad se yuvaaon kii ore se sabase badi chunauti mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ko ab mili he
 How Akhilesh takes away the resentment of millions of youth who have come out against the scam, this will determine his stature as a youth leader
 upi ke mathura main suraksha ke lihaaj se ati samvedansheel shrikrishna janmasthan-shahi idgah parisar kii suraksha vyavastha main tainaat ek upanireekshak kaa khun se lathpath shav mila he

 Senior Superintendent of Police Babloo Kumar said that sub-inspector Nand Kishore Sharma, resident of Baghpat district's town Doghat, had been deployed for the security of the premises of Shri Krishna's birthplace for two years
 janmabhumi ke nikat potra kunda ke paas mohalla mallpura main kiraye par akele rah rahe the
 He said that on July 15, he had gone to his room after doing duty in the morning shift from five to one o'clock
 agle din vah duty par nahin pahunche
 The police control room in-charge at Srikrishna's birthplace tried to find out the reason for this, but he could not find any
 ravivaar ko unke kamare ke nikat se guzarate hue upanireekshak anil kulshreshth ne jab unke kamare se khun bahakar aate dekha to unhen kuch andeh hua
 He immediately informed the police control room
 iske baad sabhi varisht adhikari maukey par pahunche or kamare kaa taala tudwakar dekha to dang rah gaye
 Blood was strewn on the floor and Daroga Nandkishore Sharma lay dead

 It is feared that he has been killed by hitting a heavy object on his head

 It is feared that the assassin may have locked himself from outside after the murder

 Yogi Adityanath has become the new Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh
 ravivaar ko unke shapath grahan ke baad lakhanu main mukhyamantri awaas main halchal tej ho gai he
 The name plate of the Chief Minister's official residence on Five Kalidas Marg has also changed but Yogi has not shifted there yet

 lekin bihar ke mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ne apni baton ke zarie ek bada sawaal khadaa kar diya
 He said that the Prime Minister's speech reconsidering the existence of the Planning Commission on the occasion of Independence Day has spread the perception among the general public that the government wants to abandon the planning process in the country and leave development to the market forces and the capitalists
 
 maanjhi ne apane vakatv main pradhanmantri kii sambodhit karte hue aage kaha ki jis prakaar se is baithak ke agenda evam swaroop kii soochna di gai he usase yah lagata he ki aapane is vishay par apana man bana liya he or rajya yahaan maatr muhar lagane ke liye hai
 On assuming power, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had expressed his intention that he wants to abolish the Planning Commission and replace it with a more effective institution
 sarkaar lagataar is qavaayad main juty he
 a meeting of Chief Ministers across the country was taken in this connection today
 baithak ke baad ke baad vittamantri arun jetali ne kaha ki zyaadaatar mukhyamantri ayog ko khatm kar nai sanstha banane ke paksh main hai
 Jaitley quoted the Prime Minister as saying that in most developed countries, think tanks outside the government structure play a big role
 darasal sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki yojana ayog apni zindagi ji chukaa he
 In return, apart from government schemes, private companies also have a major contribution in the development work
 yojana banane main unako saath liye bina desh kaa samgr vikaas sambhav nahin
 Therefore, there should be an institution in which the central and state governments are represented, important people other than the government should also be made part of it
 lagata he ki sarkaar ke isi khyaal ko maanjhi puunjipatiyon or bazaravaadi shaktiyon ke badhaave se jod kar dekh rahe hon
 However, it is also a big truth that the Planning Commission set up in 1950 failed to take the country to the development point that the country needed
 aise main modi kii nai pahal se kai mukhyamantriyon ko ummid kii ek nai raushnee bhi dikhti he
 In the meeting, the Chief Ministers of several states demanded that the Center decide the policy according to the needs of the state
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne yojana bajet se rajya ko milane vaali hissedari ke kamatar hone par chintaa jataayi or maang kii ki iskaa kam se kam 50 fisadi hissaa rajya ko ekamusth taur par mili
 At the same time, there was a suggestion from Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Panneerselvam that the cash subsidy should be transferred to the people's account only through the state governments
 baithak main mamata banerjee or umr abdulla apni-apni vajahon se nahin pahunche
 Whatever these two want to convey the message, but the fact is that under the federal structure, the state has to come to the center for help
 aise main centre kii zimmedaari tay karne ke liye unhen bhi yahaan aakar apni baat majbooti se rakhni chahie thi taaki kal ko shikaayat kii naubat na aae

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi added the watchman next to the name in his Twitter handle at around 11 am on Sunday
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne bhi yahi kiya
 After this, there was a competition among social ministers and party supporters on social media to put a watchman in front of the name
 yah sab piem modi kii ore se launch main bhi chaukeedaar hum campan ke tahat kiya gaya
 When Modi was in the cabinet to put the watchman in front of all the ministers including Piyush Goyal, Thawar Chand Gehlot, Smriti Irani, then key ministers like Home Minister Rajnath Singh, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Nirmala Sitharaman looked away from this campaign
 ravivaar ko saadhe teen baje tak in pramukh mantriyon ketvitor handle ko dekhne par pataa chalaa ki inhonenam ke aage chaukeedaar nahin lagaaya tha
 The campaign to put a watchman in the name started at 11 am
 kareeb ghante bhar ke bheetar kuch varisht mantriyon ko chhodkar sabhi ne laga liya tha
 Arun Jaitley and Nitin Gadkari did not put up at first, but by four o'clock in the evening they too had added the watchman

 Chief Minister, this is not your natural disaster but your corrupt disaster
 tejasvi ne kaha ki aapaki bhrasht afasarshahi ne aapke 15 varsh ke vikaas ko gater se nikaalkar desh ko dikhaaya he
 In your perceived good governance, at the same time as the boat is going on in Rajendranagar and Kankarbagh, dust is blowing in other parts of Patna
 agar ye prakritik aapadaa he to aap jis locality main rahete he vahaan yah aapadaa kyon nahin ai?tejasvi ne kaha ki mukhyamantri ji bataaen, samp house kaa kaam nahin karnaa, naala udaahi nahin hona, nagar vikaas mantri kaa har samay gaayab rahanaa or naalon main kachra hona kya prakruti kaa dosha he? ye 6 fit tak jamaa ganda pani aapaki naakaami kii kahani bayaan kar rahaa he
 After this, Tejashwi remarked about the Nitish Kumar government officials that where are your favorite Patna Commissioners who destroy the homes and businesses of the poor? When you come out to investigate your failure, instead of the officials of the concerned department, you are roaming with the officers of other departments who have nothing to do with it
 mukhyamantri ji bataaen, patna ko nark main tabdeel karne kaa jimmedaar koun he? Actresses Sonam Kapoor and Anand Ahuja are one of the most romantic couples in Bollywood

 ) The law and order in Gujarat is not good for conducting local body elections, saying that the State Election Commission has postponed the elections for local bodies to be held in october-november in the state for three months
 gujarat main ahmedabad, surat samet 6 mahanagarapalika, 56 nagarpalika, 230 taluka panchayat or 31 zila panchayat ke chunaav oktober november main hone the
 Now after their term is over, action will be taken to appoint an administrator in all of them
 is faisle se congress sabase zyada maayoos he
 The Election Commission was pointing to the Patidar Reservation Movement in Gujarat for the last two months
 congress ko ye lagane laga tha ki bhaajapa ke majboot votbank kahe janevaale patidaar agar sarkaar se khafa hai or agar bhaajapa ko vot nahin denge to iskaa phayda sidhaa congress ko ho saktaa tha
 In such a situation, the Congress is telling the bjp's move to postpone the election
 uskaa aarope he ki chunaavon main haar ke dar se bhaajapa ne chunaav taale hai
 The Congress also alleges that if the BJP lost the local elections in Gujarat, it could have an impact directly on the Bihar elections, which is why the BJP has deferred elections
 ab samay par chunaav karwaane ke liye congress ne gujarat hoicourt kaa daravaaza khatkhatane kaa faisla kiya he
 Not only the Congress, the leaders associated with the Patidar movement opposing the BJP are also disappointed by this decision
 patidaar aarakshan andolan ke netaa hardik patel ne ek sandesh dekar kaha ki sarkaar haar ke dar se ye chunaav taal rahi he
 If there was violence in the state only on 25 and 26 August, then how did the law and order deteriorate
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki bhaajapa kah rahi he ki patidaar voton se chunaav main koi fark nahin padegaa to wo chunaav karwaakar dekh len
 The comments lekin is bich bhaajapa ne kaha he ki congress pichley 25 saal se rajya main satta se baahar he isliye satta main aane ke liye khwab dekh rahi he
 But the way the people have supported the BJP by keeping the Congress away from power for the last 25 years, similarly this time will also support the BJP
 congress ke shasankaal main bhi kai baar chunaav tale hai, isliye bhaajapa par aarope lagaana thik nahin he
 But experts believe that if elections are held in the present environment, then the BJP may have to face opposition from its most trusted vote bank Patels and it can also have an impact on the results
 agar kisi vajah se bhaajapa haari to iskaa asar pradhanmantri narendra modi ke chhavi par bhi pad saktaa he kyonki aakhir gujarat unka apana griharajya he or agar yahaan nattejey vipareet aate hai to uski charchaa zarur hogi
 In Gujarat, elections to 6 municipal corporations including Ahmedabad, Surat, 56 municipalities, 230 taluka panchayats and 31 district panchayats were to be held in october-november
 ab inaki miyaad khatm hone ke baad in sabhi main administrator niyukt karne ke liye karrwai hogi
 The Congress is most disappointed by this decision
 maahaul thik nahin hone ke peeche chunaav ayog kaa ishaara gujarat main pichley do maheene se chal rahe patidaar aarakshan andolan kii ore tha
 The Congress began to feel that if the Patidars, who were called the strong vote banks of the BJP, were upset with the government and if they did not vote for the BJP, then it could directly benefit the Congress
 aise main congress chunaav taalane ko bhaajapa kii chaal bataa rahi he
 It is alleged that the BJP has postponed elections for fear of losing elections
 congress kaa aarope ye bhi he ki agar gujarat ke sthaneey chunaavon main bhaajapa kii haar hoti to uskaa asar sidhaa bihar ke chunaavon par pad saktaa tha isiilie bhaajapa ne chunaav taale hai
 Now, in order to have elections on time, the Congress has decided to knock the door of the Gujarat High Court
 sirf congress hi nahin, bhaajapa kaa virodh kar rahe patidaar andolan se jude netaa bhi is faisle se maayoos hai
 Patidar Reservation Movement leader Hardik Patel gave a message that the government is postponing this election in fear of defeat
 sirf 25 or 26 agast ko hi rajya main hinsa hui thi to kanoon vyavastha kaise bighad gai
 He also said that the BJP is saying that the Patidar votes will not make any difference in the election, then they should get the election done
 tippaniyan But in the meantime BJP has said that Congress has been out of power in the state for the last 25 years, so it is looking forward to come to power
 lekin jis tarah se pichley 25 saalon se congress ko logon ne satta se dur rakhkar bhaajapa kaa saath diya he, vaise hi is baar bhi bhaajapa kaa saath degi
 Elections have been postponed several times during the Congress regime, so it is not right to accuse the BJP
 lekin jaankaar maanate hai ki abhi ke maahaul main agar chunaav hote hai to bhaajapa ko apane sabase vishwast votbank patelon kaa virodh jhelana pad saktaa he or nateezon par iskaa asar bhi pad saktaa he
 If the BJP loses due to any reason, then it can also have an impact on the image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, because after all Gujarat is his own home and if the results here are opposite then it will definitely be discussed
