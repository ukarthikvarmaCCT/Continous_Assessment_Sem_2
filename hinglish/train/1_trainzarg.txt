 But i want to tell you, do not get into his words
 agar modi jeet rahaa he to bharpoor matdaan karnaa or adhik voton se jitaana
 Significantly, even before this, the Prime Minister has said many times that people are now saying that Modi is winning, so why go to vote, PM is constantly appealing for more voting
 pradhanmantri bole ki ham jeet rahe hai lekin har jagah se camel aana chahie, isliye vot jarur karen
 When our government nailed the corrupt, these people are calling the watchman a thief
 unhone kaha ki vipaksh mishan mahamilawat chalaa rahaa he, inkaa makasad khichdi vaali sarkaar bananaa he taaki vah ghotaalaa kar saken
 In the rally, PM Modi said that a strong government is needed to move the country forward, but the opposition wants to take the country back by forming a government with slang
 unhone kaha ki hamaari sarkaar ne jharkhand main vikaas ko aage badhaayaa he, ab koderma-hazaribagh-barkana-siddhvaar section taiyaar he or ek dedh saal main ranchi tak puri line taiyaar karne kii taraf ham bad rahe hai

 Politicians, Rajput societies, media are all cashing it in their own way

 The problem is that we have been taught the wrong history
 apni film ke dauraan maine research main paaya ki 90 fisadi logon kaha ki unhen galat history padhai gai
 Also read: If you look at the history of the first day of India Today Conclave East 2017, Vivek Agnihotri's film Buddha in Traffic Jam could also be banned by saying that Buddha never lived in traffic jam

 Mother Satyabhama brought her to Tamil Nadu after her death

 The youngster MGR soon switched to films due to his interest in theater
 1936 main film 'saathi leelavati' se tollywood main debyue karne ke baad unhone peeche mudakar nahin dekha
 MGR remained the bright star of Tamil cinema for the next three decades
 1953 tak mjiaar congress ke sadsy rahe
 This was the time when DMK founder Annadurai was at the peak of popularity in Dravidian politics

 But after the death of Annadurai, the distance between the two leaders began to form
 1969 main karunanidhi rajya ke mukhyamantri bane to mjiaar ne apni jagah party ke satta ke centre ke taur par majboot kii
 MGR played an important role in making Karunanidhi powerful in the early days
 lekin 1972 main jab unhone bhrashtachar kaa mudda uthaaya to karunanidhi ne unhen party se barkhaast kar diya
 MGR then established ADMK
 yahi party baad main ediemke kahalaai
 MGR was the one who brought Jayalalithaa into politics in 1982
 jayalalita ke saath wo lagbhag 25 filmon main kaam kar chuke the

 Xiaomi ne bharat main Redmi 7A launch kiya he
 The price starts at Rs 5,999
 market main is segment ke duusare bhi smartfones hai, lekin company ne iske camera sensor ke saath launch ke dauraan yugers ko chaunkaaya jarur he
 However, you can buy it cheaply in the month of July for 200 rupees only
 Redmi 7A ek entry level bajet smartphone he, aap ise entry level smartphone bhi kah sakate hai
 It will go on sale from July 11
 is smartphone ko 4 din tak yuj karne ke baad ham aap tak ye rivyuu laa rahe hai
 Design and build qualitymain has reviewed the matte blue variant of Xiaomi Redmi 7A
 phone neet or clin he
 Talk about the rear panel, here is the branding of Redmi in the bottom left side which looks new
 top rhite corner main ek camera he or iske neeche elidi flash he
 Talking about the front of Redmi 7A, the bezel display will be seen here, the branding of Redmi in the bottom and the selfie camera and iris in the top
 rhite said main wolum rocker or power batan hai or bottm main spikar gril ke saath micro yuasabi port
 The headphone jack is on the top
 Redmi 7A ke box main aapako charger miltaa he
 The company does not provide earphones and no case has been given with it
 bild quality kii baat karen to Redmi 7A hard plastic kaa he, lekin metal kaa feel detaa he, kyonki quality badhiya he
 In terms of Look and Feel and Feel, this phone seems compact
 haath main thod thik jarur lagata he
 But it really looks durable
 company ne drop test kiya tha, lekin hamane iskaa drop test nahin kiya he
 Display Redmi 7a's display 5
 45 inch kii he
 The IPS panel is used and is HD +
 aspect reshyo kii baat karen to ye 18:9 kaa he
 The display of the phone is bright and fine, there is nothing special
 disple acha kiya ja saktaa tha
 But if you look at the price, at this price you cannot get a better display from it
 phir bhi company agar isse better disple detii to behatar hota
 Now you might be getting confused
 kanphyus na hon, disple se niraash to nahin honge
 Keep in mind that there are bezels in the display
 jitne din yuj kiya ise disple kaa respons acha rahaa he
 Performance comes directly on the performance of Redmi 7A
 Redmi 7A main Qualcomm Snapdragon 439 prosesar diya gaya he or ye do memory verients ke saath aata he
 16GB memory with 2GB of RAM in one, 32GB of storage with 2GB of RAM in the second variant
 micro esady card kaa slot bhi he
 Take any variant, there will be no significant difference in performance
 basic yuj ke liye ye 5,999 rupee kaa Redmi 7A shandaar he
 Is fast, smooth and stable
 heavi yuj ke liye ye phone nahin he
 Cannot play big games
 soshal media se jude sabhi eps jaise fasebuk, insta, watsap, massenger, telegram or darjanon is tarah ke ap bina ruke achche se kaam karte hai
 There are also some pre-loaded apps in the phone, which i personally don't like
 Redmi 7A main Android 9 Pie besd MIUI 10 diya gaya he
 We are not saying this for the first time, the company has made a lot of improvement in this user interface
 dark mod diya gaya he or ise yuj karnaa ek acha expirience rahaa he
 There is no such thing as a fingerprint scanner in Redmi 7A
 lock karne ke liye pin, pattern or phase analock he
 Face unlock selfie camera is based and it is not secure
 phir bhi aap ise yuj karnaa chahen to kar sakate hai
 However, sometimes it takes some time for face detection
 lekin dhire dhire aap ise samaj lenge to aapako fast lagegaa
 There is not much problem in switching apps
 haa, ack ap se duusare ap main switch karenge to aapako respons jarur thodaa kamjor lagegaa or loding main bhi thodaa samay notice karenge
 But since this phone is placed in a segment slightly above the entry level, we cannot complain for it
 videos, mujeec or colling ke liye bhi phone acha he
 In basic use, we have not found any problem in this
 in chaar din main phone main hang hone kii bhi samasya nahin mili, isliye Thumbs Up
 For first time smartphone users, this phone can prove to be a great package, because its camera is also good
 aaie ab baat karte hai camera kii
 Camera Redmi 7A has the same camera sensor that is given in Redmi Note 7 and Mi A2
 lekin kya camera parformens bhi un smartphone ke level kaa he? jawaab he – nahin
 The camera performance is not of the level of those smartphones, as it has a lens and it is wrong to expect that if the smartphone is of other segments too
 rier camera 12 megapixl kaa he
 Redmi 7A has a single rear camera and the company has given the Sony IMX486 sensor
 photography ke liye phone to nahin he, lekin decent photo clic ho jaati he
 Especially if the light is good, then you will click such photo which can be uploaded on Instagram and Facebook
 camere main Pro mod bhi diya gaya he
 In these cases, if you want to do something new, then you can try it too, i tried it, so it could not get any better result
 camere main AI butification jaise fitures die gaye hai
 To click good pictures from Redmi 7A, you have to give some time
 focus karne main vakt lagata he iske camere se, lekin iskaa rigelt acha he
 HDR also works fine
 kam raushnee main camera niraash karata he
 Overall, we will say the same thing again, which you may find boring
 is keemat par isaki photography aapako shandaar lagegi
 Somewhere the USP of Xiaomi's smartphones is the same and perhaps this is also the reason why the company is number-1 in this segment, especially in the Indian market
 bydareeshedmi 7A kii bydaree 4,000mah kii he
 This is wonderful
 phul charge karke ek din se zyada kaa byaap le sakate hai
 It takes about 2 hours to full charge
 agar aap phone zyada yuj nahin karte hai to isse do din kaa bhi byaap nikaal lenge
 i have backed out a maximum of one and a half days from this
 photose clic kare, soshal media eps or ek ghante gane sun kar
 Redmi 7A is a great package, but --- a variant of this smartphone should have 3GB RAM variants
 --- disple ko or behatar kiya ja saktaa tha
 Should you buy this smartphone? You can buy a variant of Rs 5,999
 is segment main isse better smartphone nahin milegaa
 Other companies should learn from Xiaomi
 lekin agar aap 1,000 rupee or laga sakate hai to is samay Galaxy M10 aapke liye sahi rahegaa
 The Galaxy M10 can be purchased from Amazon's website for Rs 6,999
 is smartphone main dual camera ke saath water drop noch style kii behtareen disple bhi milti he

 Political Counselor Li Ya at the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi has accused Indian soldiers of crossing the india-china border in the Sikkim sector
 yaa ne kaha ki bharatiyon ne chini sainikon ko uksaane vaali karrwai kii he
 Ya said that the Sikkim section is an important part of the 1890 Tibet and Sikkim Convention between China and Great Britain and Indian troops violated Chinese sovereignty
 chini counslar ne kaha ki doklam main bharat or china ke bich tanatani ko lekar bahut chintit hum
 Meanwhile, India has asked China to withdraw its army from Bhutan

 In response to a question on Chinese media and the think tank's comment about a possible 'war', he said that it was being talked about
 ye bharat sarkaar par nirbhar he ki vah kya chaahati he

 Where did the dispute start? Recently, Indian troops protested against the construction of road in Donglong in Sikkim sector from China

 Since then, thousands of soldiers of both countries are standing face to face
 darasal china border par bharat ne apni taiyaariyaan majboot kii hai
 China is unable to digest the construction work of the Indian Army of new bunkers in place of the old bunkers and is calling it action provoking
 china kii kya he aapattiyambhartiya bunker hataae jane kii ghatana june ke pehle saptaah main sikkim ke doka laa ilaake main hui jisase sikkim kshetra main bharat-china seemaa par tanaav paidaa ho gaya
 The history of china-india border dispute is quite long

 Of this, 220 km falls in Sikkim
 chunki is ilaake main border line puri tarah spasht nahin he, isliye koi spasht aadhaar nahin he seemaa kaa
 The Bhutan connection to the Learn dispute: Indian troops protested against the construction of a road from China in Donglong area of sikkim sector
 vahaan china kaa kahana he ki ye seemaa bhutan se lagati he or bharat teesraa paksh he
 He does not have the right to speak in this, whereas the truth is that India looks after Bhutan's foreign and defense affairs and India has the right to resolve this issue with China
 china ko bhutan par bharat kaa ye prabhaav raas nahin aa rahaa
 What did the Chinese Foreign Ministry say? China's Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying - Hopefully countries respect the sovereignty of other countries
 china-bhutan seemaa nirupit nahin he, kisi tisare paksh ko is maamle main hastkshep nahin karnaa chahie or gairjimmedaarana tippanee yaa karrwai nahin kerani chahie
 China accused India of a secret agenda and said if a third party intervenes with a secret agenda, it is an insult to Bhutan's sovereignty
 ham aisa nahin dekhnaa chaahate kyonki bhutan antarrashtriya samudaay dwaara samprabhutaa kaa hakdaar he
 China legalized road construction in the Sikkim sector and insisted that it was being built in the Chinese region, which neither belonged to India nor Bhutan
 unhone kaha ki kisi anya desh ko hastkshep karne kaa adhikaar nahin he

 On this, people have started trolling him on social media

 As the rising Olympic torch travels along the path of London from one hand to the other, we are connecting it to the glory of an age-old tradition, in which this event is limited to a few naked Greek men
 Used to be is mashaal main nishchit rup se tel se jalane vaali mashaalon kaa andaaj he, jo ek svarnim ateet ke yug kaa aks khinch detii he

 Its culture is like an opaque conspiracy, and the unrighteous are seen with a lot of heartache who try to disrupt the ways of this secret society's internal scams, as current sports minister Ajay Maken realized when He thought that the Government of India was more important than the Board of Control for Cricket in India

 Rahul is active in the functioning of the party
 aise main priyanka gandhi kii raajnneeti main entry ko lekar samay-samay par congress ke andar or baahar se maang uthati rahi he
 Regarding Priyanka's entry into politics, former Congress president Sonia Gandhi said that this decision Priyanka Gandhi has to decide when she will enter politics
 india today conklev ke 17wein sanskaran main pehle din congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi shaamil hui
 On this occasion, Sonia gave her opinion with great impatience when daughter Priyanka Gandhi came and did not enter politics
 india today samooh ke chairman arun puri ke sawaalon kaa jawaab dete hue sonia ne kaha ki priyanka gandhi ko raajnneeti main aane kaa faisla khud karnaa he
 Sonia said that Priyanka Gandhi's children are in their teens
 unki parikshaayen hai
 The statement of the Congress leader means that Priyanka Gandhi's knock in politics will have to wait a few more days
 sonia ke lihaaj se dekha jaae to bacchon ke bade hone ke baad priyanka raajnneeti main entry kar sakati hai
 Let me tell you that Priyanka Gandhi takes charge of the election campaign of her mother Sonia Gandhi and brother Rahul Gandhi's parliamentary constituency
 iske alaava raibareli ke congress sanghathan ko bhi dekhati hai
 The party organization plays its role in Rae Bareli as directed by Priyanka
 raibareli or amethi ke party netaaon ke saath dilli main lagaataar wo baithken bhi karti rahati hai
 In view of this, since Sonia Gandhi left the Congress, there has been speculation that Priyanka Gandhi may contest from Rae Bareli to handle the political legacy of mother Sonia
 rahul gandhi kii tajposhi ke dauraan priyanka ne kaha tha ki raibareli se maa sonia gandhi hi chunaav ladengi
 Sonia Gandhi said in the 17th edition of India Today Conclave in Mumbai on Friday that this party will decide whether she will contest the election or not, but Sonia did not refuse to contest in 2019
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki sonia ke chunaav ladane kaa faisla ab party adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko hi karnaa hoga

 On Friday, Kumaraswamy held a press conference in his chamber in the assembly with some documents and demanded that the CBI should be investigated where Chief Minister Siddaramaiah's watch worth Rs 70 lakh came from him
 tippaniyan According to Kumaraswamy, a watch resembling Siddaramaiah's expensive watch was stolen from Bengaluru and its case is registered at Kabban Park police station
 chori ke kuch dinon ke baad hi mukhyamantri ko ghadi mili
 In such a situation, whether there is any relation between these two watches, it should be investigated

 unka daawa he ki ye beshkeemtee ghadi unke ek mitra ne unhen bhent kii thi jo ki dubai main rahete hai
 Kumaraswamy demands that the Chief Minister tell with solid evidence where this watch came from
 kya ise kisi varisht police officer ne unhen diya yaa kisi or ne iske foran baad mukhyamantri siddharmaiya ne in aaropon ko bebuniyaad bataaya or ghatiya astr kii raajnneeti qaraar diya

 ab sansadeey samiti ne 18 disambar tak krishi mantralay se kaha he ki vah saansadon kii taraf se uthaae gaye sawaalon ke jawaab den
 Terming the efforts of some elements in Russia to ban the Bhagavad Gita, the government today expressed confidence that this friendly country government will take appropriate steps towards resolving the matter
 bhagavat gita ko ‘ugravadi sahitya’ bataa kar rus ke siberia kii ek adaalat main ise pratibandhit karne sambandhi maamle kii sansad main kadi bhartsana ke baad videsh maamalon ke mantri esaem krishna ne loksabh main die bayaan main kaha ki sarkaar ne is maamle ko bahut gambhirtha se liya he or rus sarkaar ke saath ise ucch str par uthaaya gaya he
 Krishna said that the complaint made in the local court of Russia about the Bhagavad Gita seems to be 'work done by someone ignorant or driven by misguided vested interests
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘haalanki yah shikaayat puri tarah nirthak he, phir bhi hamane is maamle ko gambhirtha se liya he or bhartiya duutavas is kanoonee maamle kaa gahari najar rakhe hue he
 Fully supporting the government on the issue, the Foreign Minister said, "we are confident that our Russian friends, who understand the values and cultural sensitivity of our civilization, will resolve this issue appropriately
" ’ sarkaar ke jawaab par santosh jataate hue sadasyon ne megen thapthapa kar uskaa swaagat kiya
 After the minister's statement, Leader of the Opposition Sushma Swaraj suggested that the Bhagavad Gita be declared a national book so that no country needs to insult it
 krishna ne kaha ki gita kisi agyani athwa bhatke hue vyakti dwaara kiye jane vaale ghatiya dushprachaar athwa hamalon se kaaphi upar he
 The statement from the government said that ever since the matter came to light in June 2011, officials from the Indian Embassy in Moscow and our Ambassador have been in regular contact with local representatives of ISKAN
 iskan ke pratinidhiyon ko salaah di gai he ki ve is bhraamak shikaayat kaa virodh karne ke liye kanoonee prakriya apanaaen
 Krishna said that the matter has also been taken up with Alexander Kadakin, Ambassador of Russia to India, who is himself an eminent Indian scientist
 kadakin ne is ghatana kii kadi ninda karte hue kaha he ki bhagavat gita bharat tathaa vishwa ke logon ke liye gyaan kaa mahaan strot he
 He has assured that Russia is a secular country where all religions are respected
 videsh mantri ne bataaya ki rus kii sthaneey adaalat main jis pustak ke bare main shikaayat kii gai he vah iskan ke sansthaapak swami prabhupad dwaara die gaye pravachanon ke anuwaad ‘bhagavad gita yatha swaroop’ prakaashan ke tisare roosi sanskaran kaa roosi anuwaad he
 Describing some parts of it as related to 'extremist ideology', a petition has been filed in the Siberia court to ban it

 The internal discord in the Bharatiya Janata Party is not taking the name of the end
 khabar he ki party ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani 2014 main party kii chunaav prachaar kii kaman purv adhyaksh nitin gadakari ko dena chaahate the
 a meeting between the two leaders was also held in this regard
 haalanki, gadakari ne adwani ke is prastaav ko thukraa diya
 According to sources, Nitin Gadkari expressed his inability to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Nagpur seat himself
 unhone kaha ki ve apane chunaav ke kaaran is jimmedaari ke liye puri tarah se samay nahin nikaal paaenge
 At the same time, Modi's supporters in the party want that an early decision should be taken on the leadership of the election campaign, because the Lok Sabha elections cannot be ruled out ahead of time
 aise main party kahin pichad naa jaae
 People in the Modi camp say that it should be decided soon so that the Chief Minister of Gujarat gets time for the election strategy
 gauratlab he ki jab gadakari party ke adhyaksh the us vakt hi chunaav prachaar kii kaman gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko dene kii baat thi
 In such a situation, Advani's proposal to Gadkari indicates his growing distance from Modi
 donon netaaon ke bich matbhed kii khabaren us vakt bhi saamne ain, jab adwani ne apane bhaashan main ishaaron hi ishaaron main madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri ko shivaraj singh chouhan ko modi se behatar bataaya
 After the controversy, the party president Rajnath Singh had to explain himself on the statement
 vahiin shivaraj singh ne khud ko modi se junior bataakar maamla thanda karne kii koshish kii
 When Advani praised Shivraj Singh Chauhan, it is remarkable that Advani compared the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Shivraj Singh Chauhan to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, both of whom were beyond arrogance, while he compared Shivraj to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi for development
 Of
 ishaaron hi ishaaron main shivaraj singh chouhan ko modi se behatar bhi bataa daalaa
 Advani had said that Gujarat is already a 'healthy' state and Modi changed it to a 'magnificent' state, but Chauhan and Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh were successful in converting the Bimaru states into a developed state
 shivaraj or rajnath singh ko deni padi safayeesivaraj ne kaha ki adwani ne modi or raman singh kii bhi tarif kii, main to tisare number par tha
 Narendra Modi and Raman Singh are senior to me

 In such a situation, when BJP state president Biplab Deb is believed to be the CM, it is not a good sign for a coalition that has won heavily

 Debbarma held a press conference at the press club and demanded to create a tribal CM in the state
 unke is baithak ke bare main bijepi netaaon ko koi jaankaree nahin thi
 Tribal votes got majority! Debbarma said, "BJP and IPFT alliance have got majority in the results of the election
 lekin yah adivasee voton ke bina sambhav nahin ho paata
 We have been able to win this election because of the victory in reserved ST constituencies
 adivasee voton kii bhaavana ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, yah uchit hoga ki sadan kaa mukhiya asti kshetra ke hi kisi vidhayak ko banaaya jaae
 It is natural that the leader of the assembly will be the chief minister
 'biplab deb ke bare main puche jane par ipft ke netaa ne kaha, 'main biplab deb ke bare main koi tippanee nahin karnaa chahta
 On the question of which leader should be made the CM, Debbarma said that something can be decided only after discussing about it

 He said, 'they have given their views
 ham somvaar subah ko ipft netaaon se milenge or iske baad hi is par kuch vichaar kiya ja saktaa he

 Yes, there is a difference in the years of work
 matlab congress jo kaam pehle kar chuki he, aaj vahi kaam bhaajapa kar rahi he
