 The manner in which Indian security agencies have selectively eliminated terrorists in the Kashmir Valley after the Pulwama terror attack, has shocked the terrorists sitting in Pakistan and their backing Pakistani intelligence agency ISI
 kashmir ghati ke yuvaaon ko aatank kii raah main jhonkne main naakaam aatanki sargana ab un kashmiriyon ke brainwash karne or bargalane main jute hue hai, jo turki jaise desh main jaakar ajukeshan scolership par padhai kar rahe hai
 According to intelligence sources, Pakistan has opened a cyber cell for Kashmiri youth in Turkey
 iske jariye iesai kashmir ke padhe likhe yuvaaon ko bargalane or unako bharat ke khilaaf bhadakaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 According to sources, for this, Pakistan has asked a group to open a cyber cell by funding it
 darasal, har saal puure vishwa se padhane ke liye turki pahunchane vaale yuvaaon ko scolership di jaati he
 This scholarship gives Turkey
 kashmiri yuva bhi is program ke jariye scolership pate hai
 Last year, one lakh 35 thousand students applied for scholarship in Turkey from all over the world, out of which 17 thousand 500 youths were successful
 yah scolership saal 1992 main shuru hui thi
 According to security experts, Kashmiri students are being targeted in Turkey because the terrorists in Kashmir are constantly being killed in Operation All Out
 kashmir main iesai kii daal nahin gal rahi he
 In such a situation, Pakistan is wooing the youth who went on scholarship from Kashmir in their friend country Turkey
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki suraksha balon or khufia agenciyon ko is par kadi najar rakhni padegi, jisase desh ke dushman kaamyaab na ho saken
 Let us tell you that this year, security forces have so far piled up 72 terrorists in different operations in Kashmir, which includes the highest number of Jaish terrorists
 sutron ke mutabik itani sankhya main aatankiyon ke maare jane or aatank kii bhartee main kami ke chalate ab ghati main sirf 45 pakistani aatanki or 55 local aatanki hi bache hai
 Last year, the number of terrorists in this season was around 300
 aapako bataa den ki haal hi main pakistani aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ne kashmir ke pulavama main siarpief ke kafile par hamalaa kiya tha, jisamen 40 se zyada jawan shahid ho gaye the
 After this, the Indian Air Force entered into Balakot in Pakistan and carried out a surgical strike
 bharat kii is sargical strike kii pakistan ko bhanak tak nahin lagi thi
 After this, Pakistan had attempted an air strike in Indian territory, which the Indian Air Force gave a befitting reply
 is dauraan hawaii bhidnt hui thi, jisamen bhartiya vayusena ne pakistani epa-16 ladaaku vimaan ko maar giraaya tha
 The Prime Minister has the power that if the workers do not get that honor, then those in coat pants get it
 kam se kam unhone yah to kaha ki mazaduron ko sammaan nahin miltaa he
 But what he has launched in the name of the welfare of the workers, does not concern the places where the workers who are respected by the Prime Minister live
 dilli haryana ke border ilaakon main chale jaaiye
 You will not be able to believe by seeing the conditions in which poor laborers from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa, Madhya Pradesh have to live
 chote-chote kamare andaman nicobar kii cellular jail kii tarah bane hue hai
 On top of a room, the rooms are made up of cards
 ye kamare nahin hai
 There are caves
 jane or nikalne kaa ek hi rasta he
 Very few rooms have windows
 in makaanon main aap jab chahen pravesh kar jaaiye aapako suraksha ko lekar koi chintaa nahin dikhegi
 The houses where the hundred workers live do not even have railings on the stairs
 galiyaaron main ghup andhera he
 The place of cooking is as dirty as the place of throwing garbage
 kya aap yahaan khaanaa chahenge
 The worker living in these rooms faces different kinds of insecurity
 hawa nahin aati he
 Cooking and bathing in the room
 zaahir he pradooshan bhi hota hoga
 This would also affect their health
 unki utpaadakta bhi kam hoti hogi
 Go wherever the workers live
 gudgaanv, faridabad, inaki simaaon se lage dilli ke gaanv
 Workers have to stay in hellish condition
 nagarpalikaayen kam se kam yahaan kachra saaf kar sakati hai
 The administration can at least arrange for cleanliness
 shauchalay kaa intazaam kar saktaa he
 There is a claim to build toilets in every house
 yahaan to sau so kamare par chaar shauchalay hai
 That too very bad
 pani nahin he
 No one knows how long these houses will last if an earthquake strikes
 inhen dekhakar hi kisi ashanka kaa ahsaas hota he
 What we are showing is nothing new
 ye saare makaan das pandrah saal puraane to honge hi
 We try to somehow get their problems in your eyes
 aapaki praathamikta main ye baat aegi to sarkaar bhi tatpar hogi yahaan saaf safai or nyaaypurna vyavastha behaal karne main
 It is not necessary to speak for the Prime Minister
 prashasan ko in jagahon ke bare main pataa nahin hoga aisa to ho nahin saktaa
 The question is why nothing happens
 in kamaron main rahane vaala mazdoor alag tarah kii asuraksha kaa saamana karata he
 The wind does not come
 kamare main khaanaa bananaa or nahaana
 Obviously pollution will also happen
 isse unke swasthya par bhi asar padataa hoga
 Their productivity will also be low
 jahaan bhi mazdoor rahete hai vahaan chale jaaiye
 Gurgaon, Faridabad, Delhi's villages bordering it
 mazaduron ko naarkeey sthiti main rahanaa padataa he
 Citizens can at least clean the garbage here
 prashasan kam se kam safai kii vyavastha kar saktaa he
 Can arrange toilet
 har ghar main shauchalay banane kaa daawa ho rahaa he
 There are four toilets in a hundred sleeping rooms here
 wo bhi bahut kharaab
 there is no water
 bukamp aa gaya to ye makaan kitni der tikenge koi nahin jaanata
 Seeing them makes one feel apprehensive
 ham jo bhi dikhaa rahe hai wo koi nai baat nahin he
 All these houses will be ten to fifteen years old
 hamaari koshish he ki kisi tarah se inaki samasyaayein aapaki nazar main aaen
 If this matter comes in your priority, then the government will also be ready to clean up and restore fair order here
 iske liye pradhanmantri hi bolen zaruri nahin he
 The administration will not know about these places, it cannot happen
 sawaal ye he ki hota kuch kyon nahin he
 In response to a question, the social worker said that connecting people like Kiran Bedi and Arvind Kejriwal to his movement was a mistake in his life
 unhone kaha ki ateet se sabak lete hue unhone is baar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf unase judane vaale logon se 100 rupee ke stamp paper par yah band bharvaya he ki ve kisi raajnneetik party se nahin judenge
 He said that he will file a case against those who violate it

 Fawad Chaudhary said that do not look at the government for jobs, increased controversy, said- His statement was distorted and the Pakistan, facing economic tightness, is busy in making unnecessary statements against India at international level, but it has not got any of its citizens Is not improved imran khan ke netritv vaali pakistan taharik-e-insaaf party desh main ek karod nae rojgaar ke srijan ke vaade ke saath satta main ai thi, lekin ab iske vigyaan evam praudyogiki mantri fawaad choudhary kaa kahana he ki log naukariyon ke liye sarkaar kii taraf na dekhen
 Science and Technology Minister Fawad Chaudhary, who was in discussion with his controversial statements, created a ruckus in his country after making statements related to his job and he had to be clarified after seeing the controversy rising
 fawaad choudhary ne safai di ki media main unke har bayaan ko tod marodakar pesh kiya jaataa he
 The same has happened with this statement
 fawaad choudhary ne kya kaha tha?pakistani media main prakashit report ke anusaar, islamabad main ek kaarykram menvigyaan evam praudyogiki mantri fawaad choudharine kaha, 'sarkaar logon ko rojgaar muhaiyaa nahin kara sakati
 Instead, i am telling you that the government is going to close 400 departments
 'fawaad choudhary ne kaha, 'pakistan main or duniya main har jagah, sarkaar kii bhoomika sikud rahi he
 It is very important for people to understand that the government cannot provide jobs
 agar ham naukariyon ke liye sarkaar kii taraf dekhne lagenge to hamaari arthvyavastha kaa fremawork dhah jayega
 This is the 1970s mentality that the government will provide employment
 lekin ab nijee kshetra rojgaar detaa he
 "what did Fawad Chaudhary say in the explanation? After his controversy grew on this statement, Minister Fawad Chaudhary took the Twitter front and said that his point has been cut out of context
 unhone twit kiya, 'main hatprabh rah jaataa hum yah dekhakar ki kaise mere har bayaan ko sandarbh se katkar surkhiyaan bana diya jaataa he
 "the Pakistani minister said in his clarification," i said that the private sector provides employment, not the government
 sarkaar kaa kaam aisa vaataavaran bananaa he jisamen rojgaar uplabdh ho sake
 It should not be that every person should be looking for a government job

 a case has been registered under mjedaar ye he ki cese sarkaar yaa police ne daayar nahin karaayaa balki haryana ke nunh nivasee surinder sharma kii shikaayat par darj kiya gaya he
 Sharma had complained to the police about the land deal, after which the police got into action and an FIR was lodged
 bataa den ki isse pehle manesar land frod maamle main bhi inhen dhaaraon main purv mukhyamantri par mukadmaa darj kiya gaya tha jisaki chargeshit bhi daayar kii ja chuki he
 Om Prakash Yadav, the complainant in the Manesar Land scam, said that the Supreme Court ruled on 12 March 2018 and stated on page 96 that the High Court had stayed the Dhingra Commission report public, but the Supreme Court has written to the High Court Dhingra Commission report should be made public
 is bich 5 maheene baad bhi dhingra ayog kii report saarvajanik nahin hui, jabaki sibiai ne jaanch karke chargeshit bhi file kii he
 Former Chief Minister Hooda has been accused in this
 33 log hai
 Builder and officer are also included
 gudgaanv ke manesar land scam maamle main 15 sitambar 2015 ko exiaar darj kii gai thi
 After which 34 people including former CM Bhupendra Singh Hooda and former IAS officer Tayal were revealed in the investigation
 haryana sarkaar kii ore se 27 agast 2004 or 25 agast 2005 main land equijishan ke tahat manesar ke naurangpur or lakhanula gaanv main 912 acre jameen ko ekwaire kiya gaya tha

 gudgaanv ke manesar main uparokt do gaanvon kii jameen ekwaire karne ke naam par privet bilderon ko phayda pahunchane kaa aarope he
 Is this case political? The question is about FIR timing
 aarope he ki chunaav najadik aate hi sarkaar sakriy ho gai he
 The question is also why the government was waiting for 4 years
 exiaar hui bhi to nijee vyakti kii shikaayat par kyon? sabase bada sawaal to yahi he ki wadra par karrwai hogi yaa nahin, kyonki 4 saal ke intjaar se andeh gaharaa gaya ki kya bijepi ise sirf raajnneetik stant ke taur par bhunaane kaa intjaar kar rahi thi

 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii aagaamee november maah main shuru hone vaali ‘seva yatra’ ke khilaaf rajd rajya main ‘pole-khol yatra’ nikaalega
 RJD General Secretary Ramkripal Yadav said, "nitish Kumar's proposed 'seva Yatra' is a hypocrisy, it is 'mewa Yatra'
 rajd iske khilaaf rajya main ‘pole-khol yatra’ nikaalega
 The rjd's journey will begin after the Chief Minister's journey begins
 ’’unhone kaha ki rajya main bhrashtachar, mahangaai, kalabazari or aparaadh jaisi samasyaon se logon ko do chaar hona pad rahaa he
 To divert people's attention from these important subjects, the Chief Minister has decided to pretend 'seva Yatra'
 gauratlab he ki november ke pratham saptaah main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii ‘seva yatra’ kii ghoshnaa kii gayi he
 Nitish Kumar will take public feedback through this journey

 Best and BMC have given a notice to cut off the power of the Adarsh society surrounded by controversies but this dispute has not stopped yet that a new land scam has been revealed in Maharashtra
 is baar bhi aaropon ke ghere main hai mukhyamantri ashok chavaan
 Chavan is accused of having 442 acres of forest land reserved for forest in Dongar village of Yavatmal district, Atul Thackeray, son of Maharashtra Pradesh Congress President Manik Rao Thackeray and Vani MLA Vamanrao Kasavar in July 2008, when he had industry and mining
 The son of son Pravin Kasavar was recommended to give the land
 ye khulaasa artiai activist vilaas vankhede ne kiya he
 It is alleged that coal is also abundant inside this land given for mining of Lime Stone
 isliye khanan udyog ke kai bade logon kii is par najar thi, lekin chavaan ne atul or praveen kii company taj lim industries kaa paksh liya
 However, state president of Maharashtra Congress Manik Rao Thackeray has something else to say
 fifa world cap main aaj se antim 16 ke mukaable shuru ho rahe hai
 Messi and Ronaldo are tested in the first two games
 agar donon ye pariksha paas karte hai, to aayojakon or darshakon donon ke liye dream quarter final kaa muqabla faleebhoot ho jayega
 That discussion will get a new flight as to who is the greatest of Messi and Ronaldo? Experts or fans all want that at the stage of age in which these two magicians are there, there is a need for such match world to put an end to the debate about who is twenty one
 lekin muqabla 6 july ko jameen par tabhi sambhav hoga jab argentina aaj 1998 ke champion france ko parrast karegaa or portugal do baar ke champion urugve ko pre-quarter final main maat degaa
 Talking about these matches, on paper Argentina looks stronger than France
 1930 or 1978 do baar world cap main hui donon kii takkar main baaji argentina ke naam rahi he, lekin maujuuda halaat mesi and company ke anukool najar nahin aate
 FIFA Rules: Because of this Messi, Ronaldo, Neymar can be suspended, the way the team has made it to the last 16 and the synergy between the team on the field is too preposterous
 team kii dhuree mesi hai or france ke coach desamp ne saaf kiya he ki is dhuree par ramda kaise kasnaa he, uskaa plan unke paas he
 On the other hand, Ronaldo's Portugal will face Uruguay for the first time in the World Cup
 urugve ke suarej or kavani kii atekking jodi behtareen footbal khel rahi he
 Ronaldo may have scored 4 goals in the tournament, but the Uruguay defense led by Godin has yet to score a single goal in the tournament
 aise main mesi or ronaldo donon ke saamne chunauti badi hai, lekin bade khilaadi mahaan banane kii raah main padane vaale rodon par hi apni raah banaate hai
 Maybe! That is why every football lover and expert is weaving more dreams than today's matches, that dream quarterfinal in which Messi and Ronaldo will be face to face and that match will decide who is the 'greatest fubler' of the 21st century
 aaazaad bharat main bheekh maangate bhikhaariyon kii tasviir desh kii sabase bhayaavah sthiti bayaan karti he
 There are 3 lakh 72 thousand beggars in the country but you will be surprised 21 percent of them are educated
 inhone ucch madhyamik yaa usase zyada tak kii padhai kii he
 Whereas more than 3 thousand have professional diploma or graduation degree and have done till post-graduation
 ye aankade 2011 kii janaganana ke anusaar, 'peshaagat rup se koi kaam nahin karne vaale or unka shaikshik str' report se hai
 Statistics show that begging is not their choice but compulsion
 padhane-likhane or degree hasil karne ke baad santoshjanak naukari nahin milane par ve bhikhaari bane
 12th pass begging to earn more than a job Dinesh Khodhabhai, a 45 year old, says in English that i may be poor but i am honest
 main din ke 200 rupee se zyada kamata hum jo ki meri aakhri naukari se zyada he
 My last job was at a ward boy in a hospital who received 100 rupees a day
 dinesh ahmedabad ke bhadrakaali mandir main 30 logon ke samooh ke saath bheekh maangate hai
 52 years old b
 com tisare saal main fail sudhir babulal din ke 150 rupee kamaate hai
 Sudhir came from Vizapur village in Ahmedabad with dreams of a good job
 naukari mil bhi gai
 Used to get 3 thousand in a month working 10 hours
 sudhir bataate hai ki patni ke chhodane ke baad ve nadi ke kinare sote hai or bheekh maangate hai
 Did not get a government job, started begging
 com kiya
 These three children are fathers
 sarkari naukari kii chaah rakhane vaale dasharath ke paas privet job bhi nahin rahi
 Today they are living through free-feeding organizations
 unki maa aspataal main bhartee hai
 Experts have expressed concern, says Biren Joshi of Human Sadhana NGO, who works for beggars, “rehabilitation of beggars is difficult
 isamen unhen aasaani se paisa mil jaataa he
 According to sociologist Gaurang Jani, 'people are begging after getting a degree, it tells how much unemployment is there in the country
 santoshjanak naukari nahin milane ke baad ve bheekh maangane lagate hai
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar hit back at Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) President Raj Thackeray, saying that he is hungry for publicity and has nothing to do with democracy
 maharashtra main rah rahe bihar ke logon ko pichley saptaah 'ghuspaithiya' bataane ke raaj ke bayaan par nitish ne yahaan samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki raaj thakare yah sab publicity ke liye kar rahe hai or unka loktantr se kuch lenaa-dena nahin he
 Nitish wondered how in such a situation, when the Maharashtra government is unable to control a person like Raj, how will he fight terrorism
 nitish ne kaha ki raaj thakare siraphire hai or congress ne unhen shah di he
 There is no one above the Constitution in this country
 ham raaj kii dhamkee se darane vaale nahin hai
 Raj Thackeray called Biharis living in Maharashtra as 'intruders'
 gauratlab he ki mumbai police ko likhi gai bihar ke mukhya sachiv kii chitthee kaa hawala dekar raaj thakare ne dhamkee di thi ki agar mubai kii police ko kaam karne se roka gaya to mumbai main rah rahe bihar ke logon ko ghuspaithiya ghoshit karke khaded diya jayega
 India, thanks to Cheteshwar Pujara's (123 runs, 246 balls, 7 fours, 2 sixes) career 16th century, after winning the toss on the first day of the first Test of the four-test series between India and Australia, after winning the toss
 The day returned in a waning contest
 88wein over main pujaara ke ran out hone ke saath hi ampiron ne pehle din ke khel ke khatm hone kaa elaan kar diya
 With this century, Pujara completed 14,000 first-class careers and 5000 runs of his Test career
 vastav main saurashtra ke is ballebaaj ne apane kariyar ke 16wein shatak se dressing room main baithe sitaron ko aainaa dikhaaya ki sankat ke samay team kii jarurat ke hisaab se kaise ballebaaji kii jaati he
 The highlight of the first day was completely Pujara's innings
 And, that's Stumps on Day 1 of the 1st Test

 com / hquqkgn6g1 Higher education is like a passport for a better future and career
 lekin kareeb sava arab kii jansankhya vaale desh main, jahaan 25 saal se kam umr vaale yuvaaon kii badi sankhya he, ise hasil karnaa kaaphi mushkil chunauti he
 a large population can prove to be a boon for the country for economic development, but it has become a curse in terms of higher education, especially in terms of quality
 desh main pratishthit sansthaanon kii sankhya bahut kam he, jinamein kuch hajaar logon ko hi acchhee shiksha mil paati he
 In view of this, during the fierce competition, parents throw their children in preparation for admission
 is sthiti kaa phayda koching centaron ko miltaa he
 Hence, their numbers have grown rapidly over the years
 inamen se kai koching sansthaanon ne pariksha main puche ja sakane vaale sawaalon kaa pehle hi anumaan lagane main maharath hasil kar lee he
 The biggest reason for the rapid increase in the number of coaching institutes is that our country does not have good schooling facilities, there is not enough commitment among teachers and there is also a lack of good teachers
 so ab to kaksha 6 se hi bahut se bachche koching kaa sahaara lene lage hai
 Apart from this, the initial investment in the coaching industry is also very low
 iske liye kuch kamaron or shikshakon kii jarurat hoti he
 That is why a large number of people have started moving towards this industry
 koching ke maamle main rajasthan vishesh rup se ullekhneey he
 Here Ellen Career Institute, Bansal Classes, Resonance Educators Ltd
 , kariyar point li
 Many well-known coaching centers have gathered their attention
 vahaan desh bhar ke chaatr koching ke liye aate hai
 Most of these coaching centers are in Kota
 ek anumaan ke mutabik, kota main kareeb 2 lakh chaatr koching ke liye rah rahe hai
 Some entrepreneurs have also opened coaching centers as start-ups
 mukt arthvyavastha main vyapaar ek avasar hota he or koching kaa vyapaar bhi nishchit rup se ek acha avasar he
 If coaching centers are flourishing, the main reason for this is that our schools are not able to provide adequate education to their children
 kuch netaa or shikshavid koching ke dhandhe kii aalochana karte hai par asal main use rokane kii disha main koi prayaas nahin karte
 The Central Government has made some efforts in the last decade
 aisa hi ek prayaas 2013 main kiya gaya tha, jab 12veen kaksha (yaa uske samakaksh) ke ankon ko merit list kii taiyaari ke liye istemaal karne kaa faisla kiya gaya tha
 But the performance of qualifying exam with competitive exams was not very successful
 desh main kareeb 50 alag-alag bordon ke chaatro ke ankon ko samekit karne kaa vichaar isse pehle duniya main kisi bhi agency ne nahin kiya tha
 It was operationalized through MHRD, CBSE, various education boards, large institutes and committees and was successfully run in three academic sessions from 2013 to 2015
 par badakismati se is mahatvakankshi prayaas ko is saal 2016 main khatm kar diya gaya he
 Probably because of management problems (especially time control, paper reevaluation and legal interference)
 koching system se bacchon par behatar pradarshan karne kaa jabardast dabaav rahata he
 Some children are forced to commit suicide due to excessive pressure
 isse nibatane ke liye vyapak str par samuhik prayaas kii jarurat he
 We have to nurture the innate talent of children right from the beginning and identify their natural interest in it so that they can take right steps towards their career in future
 hamen apane bacchon ko sirf ejineering, medical yaa chartered accountency jaise kariyar kii ore nahin jhonknaa chahie
 Nowadays there are many other options for a good career, such as law, hotel management, fine arts, journalism, and finance, etc
 in dinon ejineering jaise paaramparik kshetron main bhi kai shakhaaen viksit ho gai hai, jaise food, fishan or chamade kii takneekee vagairah
 Getting caught in the coaching trap can be avoided by choosing a career that suits your interest
 dhire-dhire aane vaali peedhishaan paaramparik vikalpon se hatakar nae vikalpon kaa chunaav karne lagengi
 Due to proper information, social prestige for every kind of work, financial help through easy loans and modern technology, students will be able to pursue their career of interest and will not just run away from their degree or job blindly
 (professor sandip sancheti jaipur sthit manipal uniwarsity ke adhyaksh hai) The upcoming elections of Maharashtra's city councils and nagar panchayats will be a major test for the two-year-old government of Devendra Fadnavis against the backdrop of ethnic polarization triggered by campaigns launched by various communities, including influential Marathas, for their own demands
 raajnneetik paryvekshakon kaa maananaa he ki sabhi dal naukariyon evam shiksha main aarakshan kii maang ko lekar chalaae gaye marathaon ke abhiyaan or jawaab main rajya ke daliton, obisi or muslimon dwaara chalaae gaye andolanon kii aanch mahasoos kar sakate hai

 He said that there is a possibility that the electoral elections of the state, especially in rural areas, would be a referendum on the performance of the Fadnavis regime
 unhone kaha ki is chunaav main kanoon-vyavastha kaa mudda, mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadh main ijapha or kisaanon kii pareshaani or aatmahatyaayein bhi ahm mudda banane vaale hai
 While the ruling allies BJP and Shiv Sena have entered into an alliance to contest the elections simultaneously, the Congress and NCP, which have a majority in the civic bodies, have left the decision of the alliance to their local leadership
 bhaajapa ke party pravaktaa madhav bhandari ne is baat ko khaarij kar diya ki maratha abhiyaan bhaajapa ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 He said that the Congress and NCP should be blamed for ethnic polarization

 Video games are very popular among children today, but experts say that parents should keep in mind the age and range of games given in it while purchasing video games
 visheshgyon kaa saath hi yah bhi kahana he ki hinsak video game ke kaaran bacchon ke dilo dimag par padane vaale bure asar ko taala ja saktaa he, basharte mata pita bacchon ko yah samajhaayen ki video game hakeekat nahin balki kaalpaniktaa he or yah keval manoranjan kaa saadhan he
 Rajneesh, the owner of a video game shop in Palika Bazar, Connaught Place, Delhi, said that the parents are not aware of the games, so they only depend on the choice of children but this should not happen
 unka kahana he ki video game kharidte samay mata pita ko yah dhyaan main rakhana chahie ki uskaa content kya he or vah kis umr varg ke bacchon ke liye he
 Deepak Gupta, a pediatric psychiatrist at Sir Gangaram Hospital, said that parents should ensure that whenever children watch television or play video games, a large household member stays with them because children are aware of the reality of the content of video games It is very important to get it done otherwise the children start wandering in a virtual world
 is baat ko is tarah se samajha ja saktaa he ki ek bachche ne spiderman kaa video game khilne ke baad apni mummy se behad bhole andaaj main sawaal kiya ki use makadi kab kaategi taaki vah bhi spideman ban sake
 Rajneesh also mentioned that parents should find out the rating of the respective game before buying a video game, which category it is because nowadays there are video games available in the market which are rich in violence as well as sex
 isliye bachche kii umr ko dhyaan main rakhane ke saath hi reating par avashya gaur karnaa chahie
 Dr
 gupta kehete hai ki yah baat is baat kaa pramaan he ki bachche had se adhik maasoom hote hai or unke liye najaron ke saamne aane vaali har cheez ek sachaai hoti he
 But he also says that violent video games do not necessarily lead to violent instincts in children
 da
 Supporting the point of Deepak Gupta, Karmama Lama is seen in the words of Thinley Dorji
 tibeti buddha dharm guru trinle dorji ne kuch samay pehle ek angreji dainik ko die saakshaatkaar main kaha tha ki vah bhi hinsak video game khelte hai
 He had said, "if there is any negative emotion inside me or in my mind, then video game is a way in which in the illusion of the game, it emits the energy of negative or violent thoughts
 video game khilne ke baad main acha mahasoos karata hum
 "playing a violent game in a video game is a skill in which if i kill the front man, it is not really harming anyone," said Dorji
 ’’ video game ankhon par jarur nakaaratmak asar daalate hai
 If we consider the opinion of ophthalmologists, many video games like Pokémon suddenly flash flash light which can damage the eyes of children
 isliye har aadhe ghante baad bacchon ko video game band karne ke liye samajhaayaa janaa chahie
 The Narendra Modi government gave the gift of the Seventh Pay Commission to the central employees in a fixed year
 july ke antim hafte main cabinet kii baithak main vetan ayog ke prastaav ko sarkaar ne lagbhag puri tarah sweekaar kar liya
 From 1 January 2016, the government asked its employees to implement the report of this commission
 iske baad karmchaariyon ke vetan badhane kii prakriya shuru ho gai
 With the implementation of the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission, the organizations of the central employees objected to the minimum pay scale and fitment formula and announced the date for going on an indefinite strike
 sarkaar ne karmchaaree netaaon se baatcheet kar chaar maheene kaa samay maanga or phir donon pakshon ke bich baatcheet kaa daur shuru hua
 According to information received from the sources, there has been some progress in the talks between the employee leaders and the government on the issue of allowance, but the issue of minimum wage remains the same
 sutara bataa rahe hai ki sarkaar alounces ke mudde par karmchaariyon kii kuch maangon ko maanane ko taiyaar ho gai he, lekin nunatam vetanman main badhotaree kii baat par sarkaar kii ore se adhikrut adhikari kuch bhi bolne ko taiyaar nahin he
 Sources reveal that the employee leaders have demanded the government to revive many of the allowances which were abolished by the Seventh Pay Commission
 sarkaar kuch alounces ko phir chaalu karne ko taiyaar bhi ho gai he, lekin maamla kuch hi aage badha he
 Employee leaders have demanded from the government that these allowances have been given for more than 100 years and it is not right to stop them all of a sudden
 unka kahana he ki sarkaar har vibhaag se is bare main raay le
 Departments should meet with their employees' unions and take a decision on the matter
 is bare main enditivi ne jab ol india railway mens federation ke secretary general or karmchaaree unionon ke sanyukt sanghathan enzesie ke sanyojak shivagopal mishra sampark kiya to unka kahana tha ki meeting main abhi tak kuch thos nahin niklaa he
 On the facts, Mishra said that the government had asked for our opinion on this
 hamane apni baat sarkaar ke samaksh rakh di he
 It seems that the government is ready to accept some demands
 jahaan tak nunatam vetanman main vruddhi kii baat he ki is mudde par sarkaar or karmchaaree netaaon ke bich do baar baithak ho chuki he
 One meeting was formal, that is the fixed issue and in the second meeting, the employees themselves raised the issue
 karmchaaree sanghathanon kaa kahana he ki vah abhi sarkaar par zyada dabaav banane ke paksh main nahin hai kyonki is samay kendriya karmchaariyon ke saath desh kaa aam naagarik notebandi ke kaaran kaaphi dikkaton kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 He also thanked the government for taking the decision in the interest of the employees engaged in the line from demonetisation
 isse karmchaariyon ko kaam karne main aa rahi dikkatein kam hongi or ve line main lage rahane ke bajaay apane kaam ko or behatar tareeke se anjaam de sakenge
 In many cases, one issue also came up regarding disability pension
 ab sarkaar kii ore jari patr sankhya epa
 No
 ll / 2 / 2016-jesie(piti) ke jariye kaha gaya he ki sena main disability pension main bataai gayi anomali ke liye baithak bulaai gai he
 The meeting is scheduled for 1 December 2016
 is baithak kii adhyakshata sachiv (pi) karenge
 The meeting time has been fixed at 11 am
 yah meeting north block main hogi
 The comments haal hi main karmchaaree netaaon ne vittamantri arun jetali ko chitthee likhakar apni baaten saaf taur par rakh di hai
 In their letter, employee leaders have also referred to a conversation with Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on 30 June 2016
 karmchaaree netaaon ne kaha he ki us samay 11 july 2016 ko prastaavit karmchaariyon kii hadtaal ko taalane ke liye sarkaar kii ore se yah prayaas kiya gaya tha
 During this meeting with Finance Minister Jaitley, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu and Union Minister Manoj Sinha, the staff leaders had clearly said that the minimum pay scale and fitment formula in the Seventh Pay Commission are badly hurt
 saatven vetan ayog kii siforishein lagu hone ke saath hi kendriya karmchaariyon ke sanghathanon ne nunatam vetanman or fitment formula par aapatti jataai or anischitkaaleen hadtaal par jane kii taarikh ghoshit kar di
 The government negotiated with the staff leaders and sought a time of four months and then a round of negotiations began between the two sides
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke anusaar karmchaaree netaaon or sarkaar ke bich hui baatcheet main alouns ke mudde par kuch pragati hui he, lekin nunatam vetanman kaa mudda jas kaa tas bana hua he
 Sources are saying that the government has agreed to accept some of the demands of employees on the issue of allowances, but the official authorized by the government is not ready to speak anything on the increase in the minimum pay scale
 sutara bataa rahe hai ki karmchaaree netaaon ne sarkaar se saatven vetan ayog dwaara samaapt kiye gaye tamaam alounces main se kai ko phir chaalu karne kii maang kii he

 apni chitthee main karmchaaree netaaon ne 30 june 2016 ko vittamantri arun jetali se hui baatcheet kaa hawala bhi diya he
 Staff leaders have said that at the time, this was an attempt by the government to postpone the proposed employees' strike on 11 July 2016
 is dauraan vittamantri jetali, grahamantri rajnath singh, rail mantri suresh prabhu or kendriya mantri manoj sinha ke saath is baithak main karmchaaree netaaon ne saaf kaha tha ki saatven vetan ayog main nunatam vetanman or fitment formule se karmchaaree buree tarah aahat hai
 According to information received from the sources, there has been some progress in the talks between the employee leaders and the government on the issue of allowance, but the issue of minimum wage remains the same
 sutara bataa rahe hai ki sarkaar alounces ke mudde par karmchaariyon kii kuch maangon ko maanane ko taiyaar ho gai he, lekin nunatam vetanman main badhotaree kii baat par sarkaar kii ore se adhikrut adhikari kuch bhi bolne ko taiyaar nahin he
 Sources reveal that the employee leaders have demanded the government to revive many of the allowances which were abolished by the Seventh Pay Commission
 sarkaar kuch alounces ko phir chaalu karne ko taiyaar bhi ho gai he, lekin maamla kuch hi aage badha he
 Employee leaders have demanded from the government that these allowances have been given for more than 100 years and it is not right to stop them all of a sudden
 unka kahana he ki sarkaar har vibhaag se is bare main raay le
 Departments should meet with their employees' unions and take a decision on the matter
 is bare main enditivi ne jab ol india railway mens federation ke secretary general or karmchaaree unionon ke sanyukt sanghathan enzesie ke sanyojak shivagopal mishra sampark kiya to unka kahana tha ki meeting main abhi tak kuch thos nahin niklaa he
 On the facts, Mishra said that the government had asked for our opinion on this
 hamane apni baat sarkaar ke samaksh rakh di he
 It seems that the government is ready to accept some demands
 jahaan tak nunatam vetanman main vruddhi kii baat he ki is mudde par sarkaar or karmchaaree netaaon ke bich do baar baithak ho chuki he
 One meeting was formal, that is the fixed issue and in the second meeting, the employees themselves raised the issue
 karmchaaree sanghathanon kaa kahana he ki vah abhi sarkaar par zyada dabaav banane ke paksh main nahin hai kyonki is samay kendriya karmchaariyon ke saath desh kaa aam naagarik notebandi ke kaaran kaaphi dikkaton kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 He also thanked the government for taking the decision in the interest of the employees engaged in the line from demonetisation
 isse karmchaariyon ko kaam karne main aa rahi dikkatein kam hongi or ve line main lage rahane ke bajaay apane kaam ko or behatar tareeke se anjaam de sakenge

 During this meeting with Finance Minister Jaitley, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu and Union Minister Manoj Sinha, the staff leaders had clearly said that the minimum pay scale and fitment formula in the Seventh Pay Commission are badly hurt

 is twit ko lekar madhya pradesh congress ke sachiv rakesh yadav ne indore ke vijay nagar thane main rahul kothaari ke khilaaf shikaayat darj karwaai thi
 In the complaint, the Congress leader wrote that 'bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha National Vice President Rahul Kothari has shared an objectionable post against Chief Minister Kamal Nath on Twitter
 unhone kaha ki mukhyamantri kii aisi tasviir post karnaa sanvaidhanik pad kii garima ko khatm karata he vahiin yah ek aparaadh kii shrenee main bhi aata he, isliye rahul kothaari ke khilaaf iti act kii dhaaraon ke tahat exiaar darj kii jaae'

 The FIR made by the Congress against me is the proof of undeclared emergency in the state, fearing the aggression of the BJP, the government can never stop the struggle for the people by giving a fine on the demonstration, FIR somewhere

 dilli ke india get se kareeb 40 kimi dur narela or bavana main ban rahe dilli vikaas praadhikaran (didie) ke shandaar flaton ke najadik pade sunsaan ilaake me laal rang kaa bada tin shed aapako dikhaai degaa
 Here you will see built-in beams, roofs, walls and even built-in concrete steps
 computericed system se lagi mixing mashin se din-raat kancreet ke dhaanche banaae ja rahe hai
 For example, in the factory, the spare parts of the vehicles are prepared and added to a place
 usee tarah is kaarkaane main flats se sambandhit chat, diwaar, beam ko yahaan radimaid banaakar phir flats banane vaali cites par jod diya jaataa he
 This is called pre fabricated technique
 didie ke flats banane main is takanic kaa pehali baar istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 This concrete parts factory is so modern that it usually takes 28 days to reinforce concrete by continuously watering it, but the concrete stuff in the chamber here becomes strong in just 12 to 15 days
 dilli kaa bhumigat pani insaanon kii sehat ke liye to kharaab he, yah baat jagajaahir he, lekin ise imaarat banane main bhi istemaal nahin karnaa chahie
 
 
 It may be known to less people

 This factory in Narela has 6-7 RO plants and only RO is filtered water from cement-sand mixing to concrete to wetting

 At the same time, other elements present in raw water affect the concrete by chemical reaction

 Earlier, the construction of substandard construction used to come in the mind of government buildings, but with the introduction of prefabricated technology, there will be no danger of falling wall by hitting the wall, because the fate of concrete made in a fully computerized plant is now more money
 The contractors, engineers, who live in earning, are not in the hands of the engineers

 bhartiya team ke captain viraat kohli bhi yuvaraj singh or mahendra singh dhoni ko team kaa sabase varisht sadsy bataate hue in donon se behtareen pradarshan kii ummid jataa chuke hai
 Most people will not be aware that Yuvi made his ODI debut in 2000 from the ICC Champions Trophy
 yuvaraj ne teen oktober 2000 ko kenya ke khilaaf apane kariyar kaa pehla match khelaa tha
 However, in this match Yuvi could not get a chance to bat and without his batting, Team India won the match by a big margin of 8 wickets
 is varsh toornament kaa aayojan kenya ke nairobi main hua tha
 The comments baharhaal is match main batting nahin kar paane kii bharpai yuvaraj ne prabal pratidwandvi australia ke khilaaf match main tufaani tareeke se kii thi

 In Stuart Broad's Mulk, England, the crown prince has a golden opportunity to shine this time
 yuvaraj ke paksh main ek baat yah bhi he ki ipel main apane pradarshan se ve shandaar tach main hai
 Representing Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL, Yuvi scored 252 runs in 12 matches with an unbeaten 70 being his highest score
 toornament main unhone do ardhashatak lagaae
 Apart from batting, Yuvraj also proves useful for the team with his spin bowling
 isaki jhalak ve 2011 ke worldcup main dikhaa chuke hai
 By the way, instead of bowling, Team India needs bang innings from batsman Yuvraj in the ICC Champions Trophy

 apane khaas din yuvaraj kii unmukt ballebaaji kisi bhi shreshth gendbaaji akraman kii dhajjiyaan bikherne ke liye kaaphi hoti he
 They are scared of bowlers
 stuart broad ke mulk, england main yuvaraj ke paas is baar apni chamak dikhaane kaa sunaharaa mauka he
 One thing in favor of Yuvraj is that he is in great touch with his performance in IPL
 ipel main sunrisers hyderabad kaa pratinidhitiv karte hue yuvi ne 12 maichon main 252 ran banaae the jisamen naabad 70 unka sarvocch score rahaa
 He scored two half-centuries in the tournament
 ballebaaji ke alaava apni spin gendbaaji se bhi yuvaraj team ke liye upyogi sabit hoti he
 He showed this in the 2011 World Cup
 vaise gendbaaji ke bajaay team india ko isisi champions trophy main ballebaaj yuvaraj se dhamaakedaar pariyon kii darkaar he
 It is expected that Yuvraj will play an important role in the victory of Team India, doing full justice to his talent

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday spoke to farmers through the Namo app

 The Prime Minister said that farmers are our feeders, they give us food
 desh kii arthvyavastha ko badalane kaa puraa shrey sirf kisaanon ko hi jaataa he
 PM Modi said that for the development of the country, the farmers have united the blood and sweat
 unhone kaha ki is dauraan kisaanon kaa vikaas sikudta chalaa gaya
 Farmers should have developed over time, but we could not do this
 ab pichley chaar saal main hamane kisaanon ke liye kai dishaao main kaam kiya he, jiskaa kisaanon ko phayda bhi mila he
 Our goal is to double the income of farmers by 2022, for this we also changed our policies
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki jab ham aay doguni karne kii baat karte hai to log hamaara mazaaq udaate hai
 The farmer is ready to take the risk today, is ready to give the results and he has done so till now
 chaar binduon par dhyaan de kisaanon kii aay doguni kii ja sakati he
 # Reduce the cost of the farmer # Get the right price for what he produces # Don't waste what he produces
 # Apart from farming, alternative work should be ready
 The Prime Minister said that this time we have increased MSP, which will benefit the farmers
 is baar kai aise binduon ko laayaa gaya he, jo kisaanon ko sidhaa laabh pahunchaayenge
 PM Modi said that we released budget for farmers twice the budget of the previous government
 aaj desh main anaaj, fal, subjiyan or doodh kaa record utpaadan ho rahaa he
 During this time, the PM told about how the farmers can benefit through the Soil Health Card, Neem Coating
 unhone kaha ki hamaara prayaas he ki kisaanon ko kheti kii puri prakriya main har kadam par madad mili, yani buaai se pehle, buaai ke baad or fasal kataai ke baad
 He said that directly speaking, from the preparation of crops to its sale in the market, ie 'from seed to market' decisions are being taken
 kisaan kalyaan ke liye ek puri vyavastha bane, us disha main ham bad rahe hai
 During this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked to many farmers across the country
 modi sarkaar ke kendra kii satta main chaar saal puure hone par samaaj ke vibhinn virgon ke saath baatcheet kaa silsilaa shuru kiya gaya he
 This dialogue with the farmers will be the sixth dialogue in this episode
 pradhanmantri karyaalay se jari ek vaktavy main kaha gaya he, ‘‘is baatcheet main sidhe kisaanon se unki baat sunne kaa avasar milegaa
 Initiatives to double the income of farmers can also be discussed, ”he said, adding that under the PM Agricultural Irrigation Scheme, 99 irrigation projects are being completed across the country today
 har khet ko pani mili, is lakshya ke saath aage bad rahe hai
 It is noteworthy that opposition parties are criticizing the government for the indebtedness of the farmers, not getting fair price for their produce and the cane farmers' dues
 aapako bataa den ki pradhanmantri narendra modi isse pehle bhi namo ap ke jariye ujjwala yojana, mudra yojana, skill india samet kai anya yojanaon ke labhaarthiyon se baat kar chuke hai
 Even during the Karnataka Assembly elections, PM Modi spoke to the workers there through the Namo app
 namo ap kaa bharpoor prayogpradhanmantri modi ne 17 june 2017 ko namo ap launch kiya tha
 In the beginning, everyone felt that from this app, information of government's achievements, schemes or programs of the Prime Minister can be taken
 is ap ke jariye piem modi ko sidhe sandesh bhi diya ja saktaa he or sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ke bare main feedback bhi, lekin kisi ko is baat kaa andaja nahin tha ki piem modi is ap se video conferencing ke jariye aam logon se sidhe samvaad bhi kar sakate hai
 Now the PM also sought the feedback of mps-mlas through the app

 What makes you happy? You are asked such a question again and again
 aap swayan se puuchhen ki aapako kaise khushi milti he? kya vyavsaay sambhaal kar hi aap khush hai yaa aap kisi or vajah se khush hote hai? kya koi or tay karata he ki aap khush hon ki nahin? kya aap vishwaas karte hai ki aapaki khushi pehle se tay he or aapke bas ke baahar? kuch logon ke liye dhan-daulat hi sabase badi khushi he
 For some people, it is limited to eating in five star hotels
 kuch logon ke heroin aadi maadak padaarthon ke seven se khushi milti he or kuch log sharaab or jue ko hi khushi kaa saadhan maanate hai
 For some people, a good life partner, a good job, a good boss, obedient children and being derailed by parents can be a measure of happiness
 sharaab or nashile padaarthon main prasannataa paanaa khatarnaak hota he
 Such hobbies are harmful not only for short duration but also for long term
 'prasannataa kaa vyapaar' ek bade udyog kaa rup le chukaa he
 Some people take pleasure in the association of pious great men and seek remedies for liberation, although in a country like India, there is no shortage of thugs disguised as sages
 aap swayan hi apane aapako prasann kar sakate hai
 Happiness is not an automatic thing
 iske liye aapako lagaataar koshish kerani hogi
 When you start finding happiness in the happiness of others, then you will know the secret hidden within happiness
 yaad rakhen ki khushi hameshaa kisi vastu kii ichha, prashansa yaa kuch karne main nahin hoti
 Find happiness in the small things of life and assume that you are happy
 koi bhi apana manapsand kaam karke khushi paa saktaa he
 If you are going to do what you want, then you get real happiness
 kuch rachanaatmak kaary karen, bekaar vyakti kabhi bhi khushi nahin paa saktaa
 True happiness lies in limiting your desires and staying satisfied with your means
 jo log kuch nahin kar sakate unke paas kaam hi nahin hota
 There is also a secret of happiness that you can use your skills in society, family, colleagues and your work
 meraa apana anubhav to yahi he ki jis din main kuch nahin karata, mujhe bechaini mahasoos hoti he
 Even after retirement, i have kept myself busy with writing
 log kehete hai ki maine bahut kadi dincharya bana rakhi he, lekin mere liye yahi sabase badi khushi he
 Sometimes i feel that there is a little bit of life for what we want to do or want to achieve
 is sansar main gyaan kii kami nahin he
 Build a good opinion of yourself and value your ability
 aap swayan apni izzat nahin kar sakate to dusron se bhi isaki ummid na rakhen
 You cannot rise above your faith
 jitani aap apni izzat karenge, usee anupaat main log aapaki izzat karenge
 Learn to be in your own company and do not let others down

 zyaadaatar pakshon ne iskaa swaagat kiya or ise saadhe teen saal main modi sarkaar kaa shaayad sabase ahm kadam mana ja rahaa he

 Less than six months ago, Rajnath Singh and Prime Minister Narendra Modi turned down Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti Saeed's request that the BJP and PDP alliance's promise to start talks in March 2015 be respected
 2016 main baatcheet ke halke-se sanket ko chhod den, jab rajnath ke netritv main sarvadaleey pratinidhimandal ke kuch sadasyon ne algaavvaadiyon se baatcheet kii koshish kii thi, to centre ne kabhi bhi baatcheet kii sambhaavna kaa koi sanket nahin diya tha

 Senior Jammu and Kashmir police officials say that Delhi has taken this step at a time when there is no pressure on it to compromise
 ek police afasar kehete hai, ‘‘jab sadakon par patharbaajon kaa raaj tha or suraksha bal bachaav kii mudra main the, us vakt baatcheet kaa ulataa asar hota or pakistan ghati main updrav ko badhaava de saktaa tha

 On the other hand, film experts also believe that 'raees' is expected to be released on Eid because some part of this film has been shot, whereas 'sultan' has not even started, so it is possible that 2016 By the time Eid was not ready to be a 'sultan'
 jaise hi 'sultan' ko id par release karne kii baat saamne ai trade main hangaamaa-sa shuru ho gaya
 Discussions started everywhere that Salman and Shah Rukh would be face to face on the Eid of 2016
 magar shahrukh ne ek event par saafe kah diya kii unke or salmaan ke bich box offis par bhidnt nahin hogi
 The comments shahrukh khan ne ek event par mazaakia andaaj main kaha ki saal main 365 din hote hai or 54 shuukravaar
 And it is only natural that someone will clash on some or the other Friday
 yah bhi hakeekat he ki do filmon ke aamane-saamne hone kii vajah se ek-dusre kaa bijness bhi maar khaataa he
 But it is our thing that Salman and i have become good friends
 ham donon sab kuch ek saath kar sakate hai, sivaa ek saath film relies karne ke
 That is, it has been decided that now Salman and Shahrukh's films will not be released simultaneously, but the question is, who will be removed from Eid? The producer of 'raees' Ritesh Sidhwani has already said in a statement to a newspaper that he will not pursue the release of 'raees' as he has booked the 2016 Eid
 vahiin filmon ke jaankaron kaa bhi maananaa he ki 'rais' kii id par release hone kii ummid zyaada he kyonki is film kaa kuch hissaa shoot bhi ho chukaa he vahiin 'sultan' abhi shuru bhi nahin hui he, aise main ye mumkin he ki 2016 kii id tak 'sultan' banakar taiyaar bhi na ho paae
 Shahrukh Khan jokingly said on an event that there are 365 days in a year and 54 Fridays
 or ye swaabhaavik he ki koi na koi kisi na kisi shuukravaar ko takaraayega hi
 It is also a reality that because of the two films face to face, each other's business also kills
 magar rahi baat hamaari to main or salmaan achche dost ban chuke hai
 We can do everything together, except to release the film together
 yani yah baat tay ho gai ki ab salmaan or shahrukh kii filmein ek saath release nahin hongi, magar sawaal yah he ki koun hatega id se? 'rais' ke nirmaataa ritesh sidhvani ek akhbaar ko die bayaan main pehle hi kah chuke hai ki 'rais' kii release ko vah aage peeche nahin badhayenge kyonki 2016 kii id kii booking unhone pehle kii he

 com / xgybn6fadr The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati will gather with full vigor to cast the backward and Dalit votes of other states, including Uttar Pradesh, ahead of the 2014 general elections in the country
 isaki shuruyaat unhone nae pradesh adhyaksh ko pradesh kii pramukh jimmedaariyaan saunpkar kar di he
 According to analysts, Mayawati has also indicated her stand by handing over the command of the state to Ramchal Rajbhar
 unhone party ke vartmaan pradesh adhyaksh ko purv pradesh adhyaksh swami prasad maury se adhik adhikaar die hai
 Due to the increasing proximity of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Congress at the Center, Mayawati is also trying to focus herself on the national plank to find a cut of the anti-sp party in Uttar Pradesh
 basapa ke ek varisht netaa ne bataaya ki mayawati ne sanghathan main bada pherbadal isliye kiya, taaki vah zyada se zyada samay duusare rajyon ko de saken
 Keeping the next general election in mind, Mayawati wants to focus exclusively on those states where the Congress is in power
 isaki vajah yah he ki in rajyon main basapa apana janaadhar badhaakar daliton ko apane paale main laana chaahati he
 Outside Uttar Pradesh, the Congress is getting a large share of the Dalit vote
 basapa ke is netaa ne bataaya ki mayawati ab tak lakhanu main har maah kii 10 taarikh ko padaadhikariyon kii baithak khud leti thim, lekin ab unhone yah jimmedaari nae pradesh adhyaksh ranchal rajbhar ko saunp di he
 Officials will now report to Rajbhar instead of Mayawati
 sutron ke mutabik, mayawati ne rajbhar ko or bhi jimmedaariyaan saunpi hai
 For example, to strengthen the organization, the responsibility of visiting the mandals and when and where to meet, will also bear the responsibility throughout the state
 nai jimmedaari milane se khush basapa ke nae pradesh adhyaksh rajbhar ne bhi kaha ki unki sabase badi jimmedaari loksabhaa chunaav main party ko adhik se adhik siten jeetaana he or iske liye vah din-raat mehnat karenge

 Rahul will meet Gandhi MLA mlas separately and interact with them

 That is why Rahul wants to know through these mlas, at the behest of which leader and what kind of temptation are they trying to separate from Congress and take them with JDU
 taaki inhen sab tathyon ke aadhaar par vah karrwai ke liye kadam uthaa saken
 In the case of Bihar Congress mlas, Congress President Sonia Gandhi called the Bihar Pradesh President Ashok Chaudhary and the Congress Legislature Party leader Sadanand Singh recently
 sutron kii maane to donon netaaon ko kadi fatkaar lagaai gai he or congress ke kunbe ko saath rakhane kii hidaayat di thi
 In fact, the upper caste Congress mlas of Bihar have been demanding the removal of Ashok Chaudhary for a long time and instead of giving the command of the party to a upper face
 sutron ke mutabik ashok choudhary ke haathon se party kii kaman lene ke liye kendriya or rajya ke congress netaaon ne man bana liya he
 For this, the Congress has also started searching for a new face
 mana ja rahaa he ki kisi savarna chehre ko congress bihar main party kii kaman saunp sakati he

 kya puraane kya nae sabhi actors kii mimicri hoti he, filmon ke prasang kaa zikr hota he, anivaary ho chalaa cricket match bhi aata he, magar sab kuch suramayi or saral rahata he
 The film reinvigorates the philosophy that the two countries stand on the same culture and land of concern and that the perceived wall of religion or nationalism cannot create a gap between them
 film main sani ke role main shaarib hashmi ne kamaal kaa kaam kiya he
 As soon as the camera looks like an ugly man, the person becomes alert and starts showing his actions

 Gopal Dutt appeared in the role of Javvad
 unhen isse pehle hamane comic shed vaale role main hi dekha tha
 But here he does full justice in the role of a young terrorist trapped in the jihad who lost his youth in money
 kahana na hoga ki film kii casting bahut prabhavi he
 The tone of indo-pakistani films is either very sharp or it is wrapped in the kitsch of forcible friendship
 magar filmistan in donon se hi khud ko tasallibaksh dhang se mukt rakhti he
 Director Writer Nitin Kakkar did not let loose his grip anywhere in the film
 tanaav, hansi or samvedansheeltaa ke dhaagon ko thame unki silaai lagaataar jatil lekin manohar craft bunati rahati he
 The location and background music of the film also serves to strengthen its authenticity
 is film ko jarur dekha janaa chahie
 The end of the film is like an open end
 jinna or nehru kii aawaaj darshakon ko bhi itihaas ke us doraahe par laa khadaa karti he, jahaan ek lakeer ne ek mulk ko do dushmano main tabdeel kar diya
 Filmistan is the name to recognize the milestones on that road anew

 Our happiness can become permanent only when we keep other people associated with us happy as well
 aise main yah bahut jarur he ki apane life partner ko har mumkin tareeke se prasann rakhaa jaae, taaki jivan khushhaal ho sake
 Here are some tips that you can try and try
 ek-duusare par banaae rakhen vishvaasadaanpaty jivan sukhmay ho, iske liye behad jaruri he ki life partner par vishwaas banaae rakhaa jaae
 This 'faith' also enables us to deal with difficult situations of life
 aamtaur par thodi-si pareshaani saamne aane par bhi log ek-duusare par dosha madhkar apane daayitv se chuttee paa lene kii firaaq main lage rahat hai
 This is a wrong trend
 isse bachane kii jarurat he
 Stay away from doubt, do not doubt each other in remote life
 shaq kii beemaari se jitna ho sake, utani duuri banaae rakhen
 It has also been said that Hakim Lukman was not treated for suspicion
 har masale par khulkar karen batarosemara ke kaamkaaj ke dauraan kabhi-kabhi log choti-choti baton ko bhi mudda bana lete hai or life partner se khafa ho jate hai
 It is possible that during this time, normal communication between the two is not possible
 behatar to he ki aisi sthiti aane hi na di jaae
 Even if such a situation comes, first of all, talk openly on every issue
 pasand-naapsand bhi bataaenek-duusare se bataaen ki aapako unki koun-si baat zyada pasand he
 Also tell them what is disliked
 ho saktaa he ki ek hi baar main koi apni aadaton main badlaav laane ko taiyaar na ho, par aisa karnaa bhavishya main donon ke liye phydemand ho saktaa he
 Participation in decision making should take any major decision with mutual consent
 nirnay lene se pehle ek-duusare kii raay jarur jaane
 Especially make women partners in decision making
 manachaaha parinaam na aane par bhi nirnay ke liye ek-duusare par jimmedaari daalane se bachein
 Divide your hand in work as far as possible, share your partner's hand in household chores
 isse kaam jald or aasaani se to hota hi he, saath hi jivan main pyaar kaa ras bhi ghulata rahata he
 Admittedly, you are very busy and you do not get time to cook casserole at home, but you can make a cup of hot coffee and put it in the hands of your partner
 kahie janaab, kya khyal he aapkaa

 RSS propaganda head Manmohan Vaidya may have clarified his statement regarding reservation, but his father and union spokesperson and intellectual head MG Vaidya has said that apart from SC-ST, reservation of reservation to other castes is reviewed Should be emji vaidya kaa bayaanemji vaidya ne kaha ki essi-asti ke liye aarakshan aavashyak he kyonki abhi bhi un jatiyon kii sthiti thik nahin he
 a fair committee should be formed to review whether reservations for other castes, for which reservations are made, have been benefited or not
 vaidya se ye bhi poocha gaya ki sangh netaaon ke is tarah ke bayaan se kya upi chunaavon main bijepi ko nuksaan nahin hoga
 On this, Vaidya said that they do not know the public in the states where elections are to be held, so they will not be able to say what will be the effect there
 kya sangh upi main bihar doharaana chahta he, phir laga 'aarakshan hataao' kaa naaraamnamohan vaidya ke bayaan par bavaalgauratlab he ki aresas ke prachaar pramukh manmohan vaidya ne jaipur litarechar festival main kal kaha tha ki samvidhan nirmaataa bi aar ambedkar ne bhi aarakshan ke hameshaa jari rahane kaa samarthan nahin kiya tha
 Vaidya said that the topic of reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes came in a different context
 yah unase hue aitihaasik anyaay ko dur karne ke liye samvidhan main muhaiyaa karaayaa gaya tha
 That was our responsibility, so the provision of reservation for them was made from the beginning
 bayaan par bavaal badhata dekh palate vaidya, kaha- RSS hameshaa se aarakshan kaa himaytiunhone kaha tha ki yadhyapi ambedkar ne bhi kaha ki uskaa hameshaa jari rahanaa sahi nahin he, isaki ek samaysima honi chahie
 Instead of continuing it infinitely, efforts should be made to provide equal opportunities to people for education and other things
 iske hameshaa jari rahane se algaavvaad ko badhaava milegaa

 maut ko gale lagane se pehle geetika ne apane suicide note main gopal kanda or uske sahyogi aaropee aruna chaddha par bhi pareshaan karne ke aarope lagaaya tha
 a case of abetment to suicide against Gopal Kanda was initially filed by the police in this case, Hopal Ganda Kanda, but after seeing Geetika's suicide note, the lower court of Delhi, the rape case on Kanda Decided to run a trial in gopal kanda ne ise dilli hoicourt main chunauti di or hoicourt ne rape ke aaropon ko hataakar aatmahatya ke liye uksaane kaa maamla chalaane ke aadesh die

 a second case was registered against Bhigopal Kanda for Geetika's mother committing suicide and her daughter not getting justice in the suicide note
 lekin philhal us maamle par court main sunwaayee par ste laga hua he, kyonki gopal kanda ke vakeelon kaa kahana tha ki geetika kii maa ke saath gopal kanda kaa kabhi koi sampark hi nahin rahaa isliye aatmahatya ke liye uksaane kaa maamla gopal kanda par nahin chalaaya ja saktaa he
 Geetika's brother raised questions on the ongoing political situation in Haryana, Air Hostess Geetika Sharma's brother Ankit Sharma said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak, "how are daughters safe if the one who kills daughters and ruins their life will sit in the chair
 jis insaan ke upar aatmahatya ke liye uksaane kaa cese he wo kaise netaa chunaa ja saktaa he
 The case has been going on for 7 years and the evidence has not been completed yet
 aise main jab yah power main aa jayega to puraa cese hi khatm kar diya jayega
 Then it will be tried to prove that no such case has happened

 saal 2008 main christopher nolan kii film di dark nite ke saath hi joker kaa kirdaar amar ho gaya tha
 Heath Ledger played the character of the Joker in this film and the character was so dark that by the time of the film's release, Heath committed suicide in his room
 apni maut ke baad hith ko apni behtareen acting ke liye auskar aword mila tha
 Fans continued to think that it would not be easy for anyone to play the role of a joker better than Heath Ledger
 saal 2014 main ai film dedpool main jered lato ne joker ke ek nae kalevar se rubaru karaayaa lekin darshakon kii apekshaaon par ve khare nahin utre
 However, 11 years after the release of the Dark Knight, Walkin Phoenix has finally challenged the character of Heath Ledger with his stunning performance and Phoenix, like Heath, has emerged as a strong contender for the Oscars
 kahanegotham shahar main ye 80 ke dashak kaa daur he
 Arthur Flake, a lower middle class man, lives with his mother
 uski khwahishen bhi thodi alag he or wo logon kaa manoranjan karnaa chahta he
 But people with him often make fun of him
 ek standap kamedian banane kii chaah rakhane vaala arthur logon ke saath hansanaa chahta he lekin samaaj us par hansata he
 The people he trusts cheat him, due to which his mental condition starts deteriorating
 joker kaa ek dialog bhi he ki kisi bhi saamaanya insaan ko sirf ek din lagata he paagalpan kii taraf mud jane main'
 Arthur also seems to cross the limits of this madness and this film makes you think, along with the climax that creates a shuddering
 ek film ke joker se dar gai duniya kii sabase shaktishaalee america fouj, jaane vajahactingaye role phinics ke kariyar kii sabase behtareen parformens main shumaar kii ja sakati he
 You can feel the impact of this character only when you see the violence being done by the Joker, on some occasions you feel the kindness for this character
 jin logon ko phinics kii parformens ko dekhakar hairaangi hui he, unhen unki pichhali kuch filmon ko dekhnaa chahie
 Phoenix has also played a character of a lonely and crazy human in the film Master in 2012
 apni personal or profeshnal life main bhi phinics kii persenality kaaphi rahasyamayi si he
 This is why many film pundits also claim that if an artist after Heath Ledger can do justice to the character of the Joker, he is a veritable Phoenix and has shown it well
 ye unki acting hi he ki unke saamaanya se dance steps ko dekhakar hairat paidaa hoti he
 In addition, the characters of legend actor Robert De Niro and Arthur's mother and psychologist also fit into their respective roles
 umr ke is padaav par bhi robert kii itani active parformens unke is craft ke prati prem ko darshaati he
 Will hrithik-tiger's War be able to stand in front of the Joker, Tod Phillips, who gained popularity by making films with encounter hangover on October 2, has now taken a long leap from comedy films to dark psychological drama
 is film ke kuch kuch hisse aapako saal 1974 main ai martin scoresesi kii top clasik film taxi driver kii yaad dilaate nazar aaenge jisamen robert di nero kaa kirdaar army main samay bitaane ke baad taxi chaalak ban chukaa he or ekadam akelaa hone ke chalate ant main khatarnaak kadam uthaa letaa he
 However, apart from Inspiration, the script of Tod's film is quite tight and they have managed to surprise people in most scenes
 film kii cinematography khubasurat he or kai jagah film ke seens aapako asahaj kar sakate hai lekin ye film ke cinematographer kaa kamaal hi he ki screen se nazren hataane kaa ek pal ke liye bhi man nahin karata vahi tite editing ke chalate ye film is saal kii auskar daavedaaron main kaaphi aage khadi dikhaai de rahi he

 Tickets on sale now at link in bioa post shared byjoker Movie (@jokermovie) onoct 1, 2019 at 3:00 pm PDT See why the American Army issued a notice prior to the release of the film stating that something on the release of the film There may be a particular community firing in theaters
 ye vahi samudaay he jo joker ko adarsh maanata he kyonki in logon kii tarah hi joker ne bhi apni jindagi main bahut rijection jhela he or ve socity se kaaphi had tak cat se gaye hai
 Could there be incidents of violence in America by watching the movie Joker? This possibility was also being raised because 300 people have died in the United States so far this year due to poor gun laws
 aisa hi ek vivaad haal hi main film kabir singh ke saath bhi dekha ja chukaa he
 Obviously, Joker can also benefit from this publicity like Kabir Singh

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, BJP President Amit Shah and Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh were also present at the meeting

 After declaring the debt waiver in all the three states, Rahul Gandhi had said that 'we will put pressure on the central government for the debt waiver of the farmers
 jab tak kisaanon kaa karj maaf nahin kiya jaataa, tab tak ham pradhanmantri narendra modi ko na baithne denge or na hi sone denge
 Rahul said, 'we promised that within ten days we will forgive farmers' debt
 do rajyon main chah ghante bhi nahin lage or tisare rajyon main bhi jald karj maaf hoga
 Modi ji is the PM for four years, did not forgive the farmer one rupee
