 After orbiting the moon for about a fortnight, Chandrayaan 2's landing is scheduled for 7 September
 chandrayaan 2 (chandrayaan 2) ko chandramaa par sthapit karne kii prakriya bahut jatil he kyonki isamen 39,240 kilometre prati ghante kaa veg he
 This speed is about 30 times the speed of sound through air

 If you are above 23-24 years of age and you are still unemployed, then you should know which deficiency you are in due to which you are not getting a job yet
 kahin aapke berozegaar hone ke peeche ye kaaran to nahin he:1
 Being nervous: Most people become nervous while giving exams or interviews
 iske kaaran aap choti-choti galtiyaan karne lagate hai
 Many students tell that due to nervousness in the exam, many such questions are also misplaced, about which they are well aware
 2
 Asking for more salary: Many candidates ask for more salary package, due to which they are not able to hire
 agar aap berozegaar hai to kaam seekhney ke liye selary se thodaa comparmij jarur karen
 3
 aapkaa vyavhaar:intervyuu ke dauraan sirf aapkaa merit hi nahin jaj kiya jaataa he, balki aapke vyavhaar ko bhi parkhaa jaataa he
 Within 5-7 minutes of the interview, it is determined whether your behavior is good or bad
 isliye hameshaa intervyuu ke dauraan sakaaratmak rahakar acha vyavhaar karen

 aapaki nolej:aap jis field menkarirbananaa chaahate hai uske bare main acchhee jaankaree honi jaruri he
 Being unemployed and wandering here and there is better that you strengthen your knowledge first and then go to the market
 ek baar agar aap kaabil ho gaye to samaj lijie ki naukari aapke peeche aegi hi aegi

 communication kii samasya:agar aap apni kaabiliyat ko achche se bataa nahin pate hai to aap berozegaar rah sakate hai
 Communication is like an art, it must be learned

 The speed of Chikungunya virus spread in Delhi, stirred from the public to the government
 rajdhani ke aspataalon main chikangunia se hui 14 mauton ke baad swasthya mantralay ne chikangunia ke virus kii jaanch or shodh kii jimmedaari ames or neshnal centre for dijis control ko di thi
 What came out after research is quite shocking
 10 saal purana he ye viresadarasal chikangunia kaa jo virus dilli waalon ko biimaar kar rahaa he wo koi nayaa virus nahin he
 In research, it was found that this time the virus that makes people sick is ten years old ie the same as in 2006
 vahi virus he jiske chalate 2006 ke outbreak main hajaaron log biimaar pade the
 98 percent similar report in both viruses also says that this time there is 98 percent similarity between this virus and 2006 virus
 east central south african (isiese) virus se hichiknguniyaaka sankraman failaa he
 This virus first spread from Africa
 ames ke vyrology vibhaag ke incharge dow
 According to the Fine Rate, 'chikungunya virus has only one strain, but there is a difference in genetic structure
 chikangunia main 3 ginotip hote hai lekin sirotip sirf ek hi hota he
 Therefore, if someone gets sick once due to the attack of this virus, then he cannot get chikungunya again
 lekindenguemen chaar sirotip hote hai
 Therefore, the risk of dengue 1, dengue 2, dengue 3 and dengue 4 remains constant in Delhi
 '10 saal pehle bhi is virus kii chapet main aae the lakhon logphilhal chikangunia virus par apni final report swasthya evam parivaar kalyaan mantralay ko saunp di he
 In the year 2006 too, due to this virus, 14 lakh people got sick from Chikungunya across the country
 saal 2006 main dilli main bhi chikangunia ke kaaphi zyada maamle saamne aae the
 At the same time, according to MCD data, in the last one week, 1070 new chikungunya patients have come up in Delhi, while a total of 314 new cases of dengue have been reported
 rajdhani main ab tak dengue ke marijon kaa aankada 1692 tak pahunch gaya he jabaki chikangunia ke marijon kii sankhya 3695 tak ja pahunchi hajodon kaa dard karata he pareshanhaalanki ames, safadarajang, aaramail va lokanayak samet dilli ke 12 aspataalon main chikangunia ke 6796 maamalon kii pushti ho chuki he
 According to experts, the matter of relief in Chikungunya is that there is no risk of life in it
 lekin chikangunia main hone vaala tej bukhaar or jodo main dard marij ko kaaphi pareshaan karata he

 " input language input: bhashaa Atali is a village in Ballabhgarh, Haryana
 sarkari namavali main adarsh gram he
 The prosperity of many people of the village is also seen from their houses
 kai hindu or musalamaanon ke ghar chamachaate nazar aate hai
 The houses of this village have a supply of gas from the pipeline, which nowadays is said to be the jewel of the smart city
 gaanv kii sadaken kaaphi acchhee hai
 There are electric poles
 gaanv main chaat kii dukaan he
 On the way to reach the village, pillars have been cut by plotting lots of land, that means a city is coming to this village too
 ataali se lautakar un tamaam varshon kii naakaami lu kii tarah jhonke maar rahi thi, jinamein hamane samaaj ko is tarah se bada hone diya he
 Our failure becomes very big when such an event happens and there is no way of return
 meraa man kisi sampradaay vishesh ke prati sahanubhuti ke kaaran karaab nahin hua na hi kisi ke prati naaraazgi se
 There is a similar pattern of such events for over a hundred years
 aap apni suvidha ke hisaab se rajya, dharm or jati badal kar dekh lijie khaas fark nahin dikhegaa
 We must accept that there is violence within us
 ham jati dharm yaa kshetra ke aadhaar par hinsa ko poste rahete hai
 Just to make them bigger, so-called legitimate excuses are needed
 brilliant horam to manipur kaa he us par bhi kisi vyakti ne thook diya
 Resisted and killed him
 ham apane hi desh ke naagarik se uske chehre kii banaavat se itani nafrat kar sakate hai ki use dekhte hi thook den
 Such incidents are happening to the people of the northeastern states on the day of arrival in Delhi metropolis
 is masale par bhi aisi koi baat nahin he jo kahi na gai ho
 This is the violence that can provoke a Dalit drinking water from a well, then watching someone eat eggs or meat
 yahi wo hinsa he jo zamin kaa vivaad hone par meghavaal jati ke logon ko gher kar 6 logon ko maar detii he
 This is the violence that creates Ramlal in an ashram in Haryana, where there was a crowd of refugees
 hindu banaam musalmaan kii hinsak ghatnaon kaa charitra bhi kuch khaas alag nahin he
 All become Hindus against Muslims, but from there they turn against Dalits
 usee tarah hinduon ke naam par musalmaan hone vaale kyon nahin dekh pate ki shiya sunni, tabaligi, barelvi or devbandi ke naam par kya hota he
 It is not that people of both communities do not know all this
 har samaaj main aisi pravritiyon kii ninda karne vaale hai magar ve aksar kamazor sabit hote hai
 We are extremely helpless Hindus or weak Muslims
 hamane dharm ke naam par koon bahaya he to dharm ke bheetar bhi ek duusare kaa kam koon nahin bahaya he
 There are more caste conflicts than riots do not happen
 logon ko vaise hi gaanv yaa mohalle se bedakhal hona padataa he jaise kisi hindu-muslim dangon yaa takaraav kii sthiti main
 Then nobody stands against this casteism
 jo panchayat musalamaanon se takaraav ke vakt hindu bani rahati he vahi panchayat daliton ko maarane ke baad bhi taqatvar jati kii bani rahati he
 This mentality of hate is not only in the villages but also in the cities
 mumbai main kisi muslim mahila ko hinduon ke apartment main makaan nahin miltaa he to jain ke apartment main marathi ko nahin miltaa he
 In the same way, in many places Hindus do not find homes in the apartments of Muslims
 aap dalit bataakar hindu ke apartment main flats lene jaaie vaastaviktaa kaa andaaza milegaa
 i know a big manager of a public sector company living in an apartment in Mumbai
 dalit hai lekin jab unke bachche kaa janmdin hota he to baaki maaen apane bacchon ko nahin bhejti hai
 The child celebrates his birthday alone
 manager sahab kii car ke tair panchar kar diye jate hai
 Basically we are all violent people
 barbarta kaa ansh kisi na kisi maatra main zyaadaatar logon main maujuud he
 Arguments made on the basis of their vs
 theirs are to justify their violence
 hamane kabhi logon se ankhon main ankhen daalkar baat nahin kii
 While speaking against caste, we prove to be intelligent and against religion
 prashasan or raajnneeti kaa haal har daur main rahaa he
 The Congress did not allow any such system to be established during its long rule
 apane kaaryakartaaon ko bhi taiyaar nahin kiya ki iske kilaaf laden
 Due to this compromising attitude, its existence was weakened, another stream of communalism got approved in its name
 kai partiyaan ain magar kisi ne logon ke bich jaakar in masalon par baat nahin kii
 The Left parties could play this role but they too do not have a very good record in the Left ruled governments
 bijepi ke raaj main bhi aapako isi tarah kii pravriti milegi
 Compromise with the powerful and ignore the poor or weak
 kahin prashasan yaa kanoon kaa raaj nahin he
 Everyone is sorry for their defeat in this defeat
 ham hinsa ke kilaaf koi janamat nahin bana paae
 Have not been able to create a non-violent folk culture
 kisi main himmat nahin he ki yah kah dene ke liye ki agar laudspikar se jhagada hota he to ise mandir-masjid donon jagahon se bain karo
 Remove this root of Fasad
 kisne kaha he ki laudspikar ke bina ishwar yaa allaah kii bandagi nahin ho sakati
 Everyone from religious places to squares is upset with this speaker
 agar ham vaaki eemaandaar hote to fasaad ke is ek kaaran ko to mitaa hi sakate the
 When there was no loudspeaker, how was there Ajan, was it not a mosque then, was it not a temple then, was there no arti then
 bujdil samaaj hameshaa aise maamalon main paksh lekar us vakt bani samuhikta main chhipane kaa prayaas karata he
 He gets strength, but he should understand that this collective formed in the name of Hindu or Muslim is not more durable
 wo jaldi hi daliton ko maarane lagati he, shiya-sunni ke khel main ek duusare kaa galaa kaatane lagati he
 After the Ballabhgarh incident, no leader dared to place the two communities in front and make strict agreements
 hataa detaa vahaan se police or kahata ki aap ek-duusare kii suraksha ke maalik hai
 All are silent
 sab ek-duusare kii taraf se bol rahe hai
 Nobody is speaking to each other
 isi tarah kii chuppi yaa ekatarfa samvaad jatigat takaraavon ke vakt bhi dikhaai detaa he
 Atali is not the last village
 dharm or jati ke aadhaar par kisi or gaanv main aisi hi hinsa janm le rahi hogi
 Any valid reason will be found there too
 is gaanv kii hinsa kii tasviren bataa rahi hai ki hinsa se zyaada bada makasad kuch lutpaat or aagjanee ke baad samaaj ko us antaheen bahes main dhakela jaae jahaan se log ek-duusare ke kilaaf hokar lautate hai
 The comments ab aaiye soshal media ke pannon par
 It is the largest breeding center of communalism
 aap kisi bhi hinsa kii baat kiijie turant sau log gaali dene aa jate hai
 You start asking that you did not talk about Kashmir, you did not talk about there, you did not talk about so-and-so
 ye kabhi nahin kehete hai jisaki baat ho rahi he us par inkaa kya nazariyaa he
 Do they justify what happened in Atali based on what happened to Kashmiri Pandits
 un dalon kii kya majaburi hoti hogi jo unheen se samjhauta kar lete hai jin par ve kashmiri panditon ko bedakhal karne kaa ilzaam lagaate hai
 Who can deny injustice to Kashmiri Pandits? apane hi desh main jalaavatani kaa aisa dard kisi ataali gaanv ke musalamaanon se kaise kam ho saktaa he
 But now there is power, politics is all that Kashmiri Pandits also trusted, why they are not able to do anything
 isliye nahin kar pate hai ki is maamle main congress ho yaa bijepi donon kii pravriti ek samaan he
 Both do not have the courage to communicate directly with the society on these issues
 unke bich jaakar takaraae
 Fight with them
 sahi baat karne kaa jokhim uthaae
 They should tell the people that if they turn their resentment into violence, the administration will not support you
 aap chahen jitna gaanv jamaa kar len, kanoon apana kaam karegaa
 Hindus or Muslims
 dalit ho yaa savarna ho
 People have to distinguish between heartburn and violent crimes
 kisi bhi ghatana kaa vishleshan kar lijie, kisi bhi paksh se dekh lijie, insaaf kisi ko nahin miltaa
 Just the violence within us gets another life
 phir kisi or jagah bhadakne ke liye
 Returning from Attali, the failure of all those years was hitting like a heat stroke, in which we have allowed the society to grow up in this way
 hamaari yah naakaami tab bahut badi ho jaati he jab is tarah kii koi ghatana ho jaati he or vaapasi kaa koi rasta nahin dikhaai detaa
 My mind did not deteriorate due to sympathy for any particular community, nor out of resentment towards anyone
 sau saal se zyaada samay se is tarah kii ghatnaon kaa ek sa pattern he
 You can change the state, religion and caste according to your convenience
 hamen sweekaar karnaa chahie ki hamaare bheetar hinsa he
 We cultivate violence on the basis of caste, religion or region
 bas inhen bada karne ke liye tathakthith jaays bahaanon kaa sahaara chahie
 Brilliant Horam is from Manipur, but even someone spit on him
 pratirodh kiya to maar-maar kar ghayal kar diya
 We can hate the citizens of our own country with the texture of his face so much that he spits on seeing it
 dilli mahanagar main aae din purvottar ke rajyon ke logon ke saath aisi ghatana ho rahi hai
 There is no such thing even on this issue that has not been said
 yahi wo hinsa he jo kisi kuen se dalit ko pani pite dekh bhadak sakati he to kisi ko anda yaa maance khate dekh
 This is the violence that engulfs the people of Meghwal caste and kills 6 people when there is a dispute over the land
 yahi wo hinsa he jo haryana ke ek ashram main raamalaal paidaa kar detii he jiske yahaan sharan lene waalon kii bheed lagi rahati thi
 The character of violent incidents of Hindu versus Muslim is also not very different
 musalmaan ke kilaaf to sab hindu ho jate hai, lekin vahaan se palatate hi daliton ke kilaaf ho jate hai
 In the same way, why do the Muslims in the name of Hindus not see what happens in the name of Shia Sunni, Tabligi, Barelvi and Deobandi? aisa nahin he ki donon samudaayon ke logon ko yah sab pataa nahin he
 Such tendencies are condemnable in every society but they often prove to be weak
 ham behad laachaar hindu yaa kamazor musalmaan hai
 If we have shed blood in the name of religion, then we have not shed any less blood in each other within religion
 jitne dange nahin hote usase kahin zyaada jatigat takaraav hote rahete hai
 People have to be evicted from the village or locality in the same way as in any hindu-muslim riots or conflict
 tab to koi is jatvaad ke kilaaf khadaa nahin hota
 The Panchayat which remains a Hindu at the time of confrontation with the Muslims, the Panchayat remains a powerful caste even after killing the Dalits
 nafrat kii yah maansikta sirf gaanvon main nahin he, shaharon main bhi he
 If a Muslim woman does not get a house in a Hindu apartment in Mumbai, a Marathi does not get a Jain apartment
 usee tarah se kai jagahon par musalamaanon ke apartment main hindu ko ghar nahin miltaa he
 You can get a sense of reality by telling a Dalit to go to a flat in a Hindu apartment
 mumbai ke hi ek apartment main rahane vaale saarvajanik kshetra kii company ke ek bade manager ko jaanata hum
 There are Dalits but when their child has a birthday, the other mothers do not send their children
 wo baccha akelaa apana janmdin manaata he
 The tires of the manager's car are punctured
 mul rup se ham sabhi hinsak log hai
 The degree of vandalism is present in most people in one or the other quantity
 inkaa banaam unka ke aadhaar par kii jane vaali daleelein apni hinsa ko jaays tahaarne ke liye hoti hai
 We never talked to people eye to eye
 jati ke kilaaf bhi bolte vakt ham bujdil sabit hote hai or dharm ke kilaaf bhi
 Administration and politics have been in every phase
 congress ne apane lambey samay ke shashan kaal main aisi koi vyavastha kaayam nahin hone di jo in baton par ankush lagaati
 Neither did their workers prepare to fight against it
 is samjhautavaadi ravaiye ke kaaran uskaa vajood kamazor to hua hi, iske naam par sampradayikta kii duusari dhara ko manzuri mil gai
 Many parties came but no one went and talked about these issues among the people
 vam dal ye bhoomika nibhaa sakate the magar unka bhi vam shasit sarkaron main bahut acha record nahin he
 You will find a similar trend in the BJP rule
 taqatvar se samjhauta or garib yaa kamazor kii upeksha
 Nowhere is the rule of administration or law
 sabaki is haar main apni haar kaa bhi afsos hota he
 We could not create any public opinion against violence
 ahimsak loksamskruti nahin bana paae hai
 Nobody has the courage to say that if there is a fight with a loudspeaker, ban it from both the temple and the mosque
 hataao fasaad kii is jad ko
 Who has said that without loudspeakers there can be no detention of God or Allah
 dharmik sthalon se lekar chauraahon tak main har koi is spikar se pareshaan he
 If we were really honest, we could have eliminated one of the reasons for Fasad
 jab laudspikar nahin tha tab ajaan kaise hoti thi, kya tab masjid nahin thi, kya tab mandir nahin tha, kya tab aarti nahin hoti thi
 Buzzdil society always tries to hide in the collective formed at that time by taking sides in such matters
 use takat milti he lekin use yah samajhnaa chahie hindu yaa muslim naam par bani ye samuhikta zyaada tikaoo nahin hoti he
 She soon starts killing Dalits, cutting each other's throat in a shia-sunni game
 ballabhagarh kii ghatana ke baad kisi netaa kii himmat nahin hui ki wo donon samudaay ko saamne bithaata or kadai se samjhaute karaata
 He removes the police from there and says that you own each other's security
 sab chup hai
 Everyone is speaking from each other
 koi ek-duusare se nahin bol rahaa he
 Similar silence or unilateral dialogue is also visible during caste conflicts
 ataali koi antim gaanv nahin he
 On the basis of religion and caste, similar violence would be taking place in another village
 vahaan bhi koi jaays kaaran dhund liya jayega
 Pictures of the violence in this village show that the larger purpose than violence, after some looting and arson, can push the society into an endless debate from where people return against each other
 tippaniyan Now come to the pages of social media
 yah sampradayikta kaa sabase bada prajnan centre he
 If you talk about any violence, immediately hundred people come to abuse you
 poochne lagate hai ki aapane kashmir kii baat nahin kii, aapane vahaan kii baat nahin kii, aapane phalane kii baat nahin kii
 They never say what is their view on what is being talked about
 kya ve kashmiri panditon ke saath hua ke aadhaar par ataali main jo hua use sahi tehraate hai
 What would be the compulsion of those parties who make compromises with those whom they accuse of expelling the Kashmiri Pandits
 kashmiri panditon ke saath ninsaafi se koun inkaar kar saktaa he
 How can such pain of burning in your own country be lessened by the Muslims of an Atali village
 lekin ab to satta he, raajnneeti he wo sab he jin par kashmiri panditon ne bhi bharosa kiya wo kyon nahin kuch kar pate hai
 That is why we are not able to have the same tendency in this case both Congress or BJP
 donon main saahas nahin he ki wo in masalon par samaaj se sidhaa samvaad kare
 Clashed between them
 unase jujhe
 Take the risk of doing the right thing
 unhen logon se kahana chahie ki apni naaraazgi ko hinsa main badalenge to prashasan aapkaa saath nahin degaa
 As many villages as you like, law will do its job
 hindu ho yaa musalmaan ho
 Be it Dalit or upper caste
 logon ko naaraazgi or hinsak aparaadhon main fark bataanaa hoga
 Analyze any event, see from any side, no one gets justice

 You start asking that you did not talk about Kashmir, you did not talk about there, you did not talk about so-and-so
 ye kabhi nahin kehete hai jisaki baat ho rahi he us par inkaa kya nazariyaa he
 Do they justify what happened in Atali based on what happened to Kashmiri Pandits
 un dalon kii kya majaburi hoti hogi jo unheen se samjhauta kar lete hai jin par ve kashmiri panditon ko bedakhal karne kaa ilzaam lagaate hai
 Who can deny injustice to Kashmiri Pandits? apane hi desh main jalaavatani kaa aisa dard kisi ataali gaanv ke musalamaanon se kaise kam ho saktaa he
 But now there is power, politics is all that Kashmiri Pandits also trusted, why they are not able to do anything
 isliye nahin kar pate hai ki is maamle main congress ho yaa bijepi donon kii pravriti ek samaan he

 aap chahen jitna gaanv jamaa kar len, kanoon apana kaam karegaa
 Hindus or Muslims
 dalit ho yaa savarna ho
 People have to distinguish between heartburn and violent crimes
 kisi bhi ghatana kaa vishleshan kar lijie, kisi bhi paksh se dekh lijie, insaaf kisi ko nahin miltaa
 Just the violence within us gets another life
 phir kisi or jagah bhadakne ke liye
 This mentality of hate is not only in the villages but also in the cities
 mumbai main kisi muslim mahila ko hinduon ke apartment main makaan nahin miltaa he to jain ke apartment main marathi ko nahin miltaa he
 In the same way, in many places Hindus do not find homes in the apartments of Muslims
 aap dalit bataakar hindu ke apartment main flats lene jaaie vaastaviktaa kaa andaaza milegaa
 i know a big manager of a public sector company living in an apartment in Mumbai
 dalit hai lekin jab unke bachche kaa janmdin hota he to baaki maaen apane bacchon ko nahin bhejti hai
 The child celebrates his birthday alone
 manager sahab kii car ke tair panchar kar diye jate hai
 Basically we are all violent people

 yah sampradayikta kaa sabase bada prajnan centre he
 If you talk about any violence, immediately hundred people come to abuse you
 poochne lagate hai ki aapane kashmir kii baat nahin kii, aapane vahaan kii baat nahin kii, aapane phalane kii baat nahin kii
 They never say what is their view on what is being talked about
 kya ve kashmiri panditon ke saath hua ke aadhaar par ataali main jo hua use sahi tehraate hai
 What would be the compulsion of those parties who make compromises with those whom they accuse of expelling the Kashmiri Pandits
 kashmiri panditon ke saath ninsaafi se koun inkaar kar saktaa he
 How can such pain of burning in your own country be lessened by the Muslims of an Atali village
 lekin ab to satta he, raajnneeti he wo sab he jin par kashmiri panditon ne bhi bharosa kiya wo kyon nahin kuch kar pate hai
 That is why we are not able to have the same tendency in this case both Congress or BJP
 donon main saahas nahin he ki wo in masalon par samaaj se sidhaa samvaad kare
 Clashed between them
 unase jujhe
 Take the risk of doing the right thing
 unhen logon se kahana chahie ki apni naaraazgi ko hinsa main badalenge to prashasan aapkaa saath nahin degaa
 As many villages as you like, law will do its job
 hindu ho yaa musalmaan ho
 Be it Dalit or upper caste
 logon ko naaraazgi or hinsak aparaadhon main fark bataanaa hoga
 Analyze any event, see from any side, no one gets justice
 bas hamaare bheetar kii hinsa ko ek or jeevandaan mil jaataa he
 Then to flare up some other place
 isliye nahin kar pate hai ki is maamle main congress ho yaa bijepi donon kii pravriti ek samaan he
 Both do not have the courage to communicate directly with the society on these issues

 It may surprise you to hear that Sindhuri Shani Maharaj gives a darshan in 16 makeup
 kyonki aamtaur par shani mandiron main shani dev kii kaale pathar kii pratimaa yaa shila ke bina kisi shringaar ke darshan hote hai, lekin indore ke juni shani mandir main puure sajo shringaar main shanidev virajman hai or us par jab kiya jaataa hai doodh or jal se shanidev kaa abhishek to nikhar uthte hai kalyug ke bhagwaan
 Here, Shani Maharaj is pleased with the anointing of milk and water and puts the devotees across
 mandir ek, kahaniyaan anek, murti ek, chamatkaar apaar, rup ek lekin punya kai janmon ke darshanon kaa
 This is the miracle of Shanidev
 unke is rup kii shaktiyaan bhakton kii jholii main khushiyaan hi nahin bharti, balki shani ke krodh or unke prakope se bhi dilaa detii hai chhutkaaraa
 The special thing is that the sindoori decoration of Shani Dev is done in this temple
 16 shringaar main shanidev kaa ye rup bhakton ko darataa nahin balki barabas apni ore khinchataa he
 The matter is shocking, but the devotees see miracles in front of their eyes as soon as they enter this temple of Indore
 indore ke juni indore ilaake main bana ye shani mandir apni pracheenta ke kaaran jitna prasiddh he usase kahin zyada janaa jaataa he apane chamatkaari kisson ke kaaran
 People generally consider Shani as a symbol of cruelty and in almost all the temples, the statue of Shani Maharaj is made of black stone with no makeup on it, but it is a temple where Lord Shani wearing royal dress in attractive makeup daily, appeared to his devotees
 Let's give
 is pracheen mandir main shani bhagwaan kaa swarup itnaa aakarshak hota he ki bhakt bas mantrmugdh hokar inhen nihaarte hai
 Along with the idol of Shani Dev, the worship method performed in this temple is also very unique, because Shani Dev is pleased not with oil but with milk and water
 is mandir main doodh or jal se kiya jaataa he shanidev kaa abhishek
 When the edge of milk falls on Shanidev wrapped with vermilion, then the form of the God of Kali Yuga rises
 subah savere sabase pehle doodh or jal se snaan karakar shanidev kaa sindur shringaar kiya jaataa he phir unhen phulon, shahi poshaakon se sajaayaa jaataa he
 You can guess from how gorgeous this makeup of Shani Dev is, that this entire process takes about 6 hours
 is shani mandir ki ek or visheshta he jo baaki shani mandiron se ise ek alag sthaan dilaati he
 Here the clarinet is played just before the aarti, which continues to ring until the aarti is completed
 bhakthi or shraddha se sarabor maahaul main bhakt maang lete hai shani se vardaan
 It is said that this statue of Shani is Swayambhu and was established several hundred years ago
 shanidev ke is mandir main bhakt apni khaali jholii lekar aate hai or le jate hai shanidev kaa aashirwad
 Where there is devotion, there is unwavering devotion, and this reverence draws devotees to this court of Saturn
 indore ke shani mandir main bhakt apane man main anginat kamanaayen lekar aate hai or sheesh jhukaakar unke puri hone kii prarthana karte hai
 It is said that on whom Saturn can please you, it does not take long to open its fate
 apane man main yahi kaamana liye bhakt khinche chale aate hai juni indore main shanidev ke is paavan dham kii ore
 Here the brick-and-brick structure is inhabited by the unwavering faith and belief of the devotees
 kehete hai is mandir kaa itihaas lagbhag 700 saal purana he or shanidev kii ye pratimaa swayambhu he
 It is about the time that this area was surrounded by forests
 ek baar yahaan rahane vaale ek andhe dhobi ko sapane main shanidev ne kaha ki jis pathar par wo roj apane kapadey dhota he usamen meraa vaas he
 Dhobi said that i am blind how do i know
 agle din jab wo dhobi jaagaa to andhe dhobi ko uski ankhon kii raushnee mil gai, phir dhobi ne us pathar ko nikalwakar shani bhagwaan kii praan pratishtha karwaai
 People around say that one day the idol automatically got entombed at the place from where it was dug out and since then worship of Shani Dev started at that place
 juni shani mandir main vaise to bhakt darshan karne aate hi rahete hai lekin shanivaar yahaan baari bheed jutati he
 Not only from Indore but also from far-flung areas people come here for darshan and worship of Shani and perform rituals
 bhakton kaa kahana he ki yahaan aane se unke man ko shanti to milti hi he samast manokamanaayen bhi puri or shani ke prakopon se mil jaati he nijaat
 Though the worship of Shani Dev removes all kinds of obstacles from the life of the devotees, but the devotees suffering from Dhaiyya and Sadesati are especially benefited by the views of Shani Dev in this temple
 nile aasmaan ke neeche shila rup main virajte shanidev
 The sky is as vast as the heart of the God of Kali Yuga
 tabhi to unhen na to deevaaren pasand he or na hi chat
 Sitting under the blue sheet, they just want to defeat the sufferings of the devotees
 haridwar ke paas maujuud he shani kaa ye dham jiskaa naam he siddh shrishanidev mandir
 The most unique in this temple is the consecration here
 ji haa abhi tak aapane sarson ke tel se shani kaa abhishek hote dekha hoga, lekin yahaan nariyal pani se hota he shani shila kaa abhishek
 This temple of Shani is quadrangular in shape and has no roof over it
 mandir ke chaaron or 12 khambhe bane hue he
 These pillars have instruments made according to different zodiac signs and the devotees who come here worship the pillars according to their zodiac sign and tie the thread of the vow
 manyata he ki shani kii puja ke baad apni raashi ke khambhe par dhaagaa baandhakar kuch maanga jaae to shani bhagwaan use jarur puraa karte hai
 Although devotees keep coming to visit the Shani temple of Haridwar, but before Saturday sunrise, a huge crowd gathers here
 haridwar hi nahin dur daraaj ke ilaakon se bhi log yahaan shani ke darshan or puja ke liye aate hai or anushthan karaate hai
 Devotees say that by coming here their mind gets peace and all their wishes are fulfilled as well
 desh ke baaki shani mandiron kii tarah hi siddh shri shanidev mandir main bhi hanuman ji kii puja kaa vidhaan he
 Here it is mandatory to worship Hanuman with Shani
 manyata he ki shani kii puja ke baad hanuman ji kii puja karne se hi shani bhagwaan kii puja purna hoti he or aisa karne se shanidev to prasann hote hi hai bajrangbali bhi bhakton par barasaate hai krupa

 Dr Kafeel further said that 27 newborns died between 10 August and 12 August, so how can the CM say that he died of encephalitis
 isamen koi aantarik (biardi medical college kii) raajnneeti nahin he, lekin yah sab upi siem dwaara raajnneetik laabh lene or apni sarkaar ko bachaane ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 If nothing goes wrong at BRD Medical College then why is the medical bulletin not being issued for the last few months
 ullekhneey he kiuttar pradeshke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne kaha tha ki pichley saal agast main 24 ghanton ke dauraan badi sankhya main bacchon ke maare jane kii ghatana ko vahaan kii ‘aantarik raajnneeti‘ ke kaaran tool mili thi
 He also reiterated that none of the children died due to oxygen deficiency and the steps taken by the government to prevent encephalitis have reduced infant mortality significantly
 mukhyamantri yogi ke bayaan par samaajawaadee party kii pravaktaa juhi singh ne kaha ki yah kaaphi adityanath rajya ke siem hai yah durbhagyapurna he
 After his statement, he (yogi Adityanath) can also say that there was no death in BRD Medical College

 The arrival of a drone (UAV) in Jaisalmer, a district bordering Pakistan in Rajasthan, created a stir and security agencies were shocked
 ek kisaan ne is drone ko uthaakar sthaneey thane main jamaa karaayaa
 It is not yet known whether the drone came from Pakistan or not, but due to the border area, the issue is very sensational and the police has started investigating it seriously
 pratyakshdarshiyon ke anusaar ek sthaneey kisaan dilbar khan ne mohangarh thane ke tahat aane vaale nedaai gaanv ke paas deva miner main kuch gatividhiyaan dekhi
 He saw something falling from a tree
 usne jab drone ko neeche gira paaya to ise lekar thane main saunp diya
 According to the police, it is a very modern UAV quadcopter and has very high level cameras
 gauratlab he ki drone aise aadhunik maanav rahit chote vimaan jaise yantra hote hai jinhen remote se sanchalit kiya jaataa he
 Although there are many useful uses of it, but in recent times, the trend of spying on the border area by many countries has increased greatly
 drone ke istemaal ko lekar tamaam deshon ke bich aarope-pratyarope bhi lagate rahe hai
 On Thursday, it has been claimed by China that an Indian drone (UAV) has entered its airspace
 is par china ne ghor aapatti jataai
 Zhang Shuili, deputy head of China's Western Command Joint Staff Department, says Indian uavs have recently infiltrated China's airspace
 unke anusaar china border par tainaat chini sainikon ne is baat kii pushti kii he
 He said that this move of India has violated the security sovereignty of China, we oppose it
 ham china kii samprabhutaa ko surakshit karne ke liye har kadam uthaaenge
 The pressure to perform better is evident on Team India, who have been on the back foot against Australia in the Bangalore Test match
 match ke duusare din kaa khel khatm hi hone vaala tha ki maidan par rabindra jadeja kii ek galati par captain kohli naaraaz ho gaye
 Before the end of the day's play, Ravindra Jadeja gave up a catch from Mitchell Starc off a ball from Umesh Yadav, after which Virat Kohli got angry with Jadeja and the debate started on the field
 vahiin captain viraat kohli ke kuchhfasalon par bhi sawaal khadey kiye gaehain
 On the second day of the match, he got Jadeja only 16 overs in the whole day, while on the other hand, Ashwin was bowled continuously
 aswin se duusare din 39 over daale
 The poor performance of the boonteam that Morsche received is also having an effect on Kohli's captaincy
 diares ke morche par bhi captain kohli fail najar aaye
 One of his decisions was overshadowed by the team on Sunday, when Sean Marsh missed out on taking the vodrs
 iske baad marsh ne ardhashatak lagaakar australia ko 48 ranon kii badhat dilwane main badi bhoomika nibhaai
 In cricket, it is said that every single ball has the ability to change the course of the match
 aise main australia ke saamne post najar aa rahi team india ko naa sirf maidan par kadi mehnat karne kii zarurat he balki ek team ke taur par bhi maidan par maahaul ko behatar or shant rakhana padegaa

 The Supreme Court had asked Anurag Thakur whether he had asked ICC CEO David Richardson to oppose the recommendations of the Lodha Committee

 Only the current ICC President Shashank Manohar was reminded of the statement which he had given as the BCCI President

 is maamle main agali sunwaayee 5 disambar ko hogi
 Along with this, the court also gave a big responsibility to the Lodha panel
 lodha panel ab bisisiai ke liye swatantra auditor niyukt karegaa
 This auditor will supervise all the contracts of the BCCI
 lodha panel hi kantrect tay karegaa
 Apart from this, the Supreme Court said that the BCCI chairman will file an affidavit stating that he will follow the July 18 order
 3 disambar tak bisisiai pramukh halafanama daakhil karenge or isse pehle vah lodha panel ko bataaenge ki riform kaise karenge
 The Supreme Court had last week reserved the order whether to appoint an administrator in BCCI or not and whether to give more time to BCCI
 sa tha hi kaha tha ki vah likhit main anderteking de ki vah lodha panel kii siforeeshon ko tay vakt main lagu karegaa
 The Supreme Court had also said that you are continuously obstructing the court orders
 lodha panel kaa bhi yahi maananaa he ki BCCI siforeeshon ko lagu nahin karnaa chahta, isliye padaadhikariyon ko hataa dena chahie
 During the hearing on August 17, the amicus curiae Gopal Subramaniam recommended the appointment of administrators to oversee the bcci's work in the case
 subramanyam ne kaha tha ki bisisiai ke adhikariyon ke ravaiye se saaf he ki wo kisi bhi tarah se sudhaar ko taalna chaahate hai
 It is a case of civil and criminal contempt
 desh main cricket ko chalaane vaali sanstha, bisisiai main sudhaar ke liye supreme court ne lodha kamity kaa gathan kiya tha
 On July 18 this year, the court approved all the recommendations of the committee
 court ne chah maheene main inhen lagu karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 Now the committee has complained that BCCI is deliberately stalling in the path of reform
 bisisiai kii daleel he ki wo siforishein lagu karne ko taiyaar he
 Several recommendations have also been implemented
 puri tarah badlaav ke liye 2 tihaai rajya cricket sanghon ke vot zaruri hai
 Efforts are being made to persuade them
 is daleel par naaraazgi jataate hue supreme court sudhaar main aadchan daal rahe rajya cricket sanghon kaa fund rokane ko kaha tha
 Amicus Curiae Gopal Subramaniam had said that the BCCI and the State Cricket Association are the same
 sirf bhram failaane ke liye kaha ja rahaa he ki rajya sangh taiyaar nahin hai
 Gopal Subramaniam also questioned the affidavit of BCCI President Anurag Thakur
 supreme court ne anuraag thakur se poocha tha ki unhone isisi ke siio david richardsan ko lodha kamity kii siforeeshon kaa virodh karne ke liye kaha tha yaa nahin
 In response, Thakur has said that he did not do so
 sirf maujuuda isisi adhyaksh shashaank manohar ke us bayaan kii yaad dilaai thi jo unhone bisisiai adhyaksh rahete diya tha
 Manohar had then said that the appointment of a CAG representative in the BCCI was a government intervention
 tippaniyan According to Thakur, he only asked for clarity based on the old statement
 wo ye jaananaa chaahate the ki kahin isisi bisisiai ke khilaaf koi karrwai to nahin karegi
 But the ICC said that the statement was before the Supreme Court's decision
 ab faisla aa chukaa he
 The ICC honors him
 sawaal uthaate hue emicas curi ne kaha tha ki halafname se saafe he ki unhone is baat kii koshish kii ki isisi bisisiai main sudhaar ke maamle main dakhal de
 Such people cannot be expected to allow reforms to be implemented
 subramanyam ne lodha cameti ko jaankaree die bina rajyon ko fund dene or cricket broadcast adhikaar beche jane par bhi sawaal uthaae
 He recommended that until the reforms in BCCI are fully implemented, it should be asked to ask for a contract tender or to issue funds to the Lodha Committee

 The Supreme Court had asked Anurag Thakur whether he had asked ICC CEO David Richardson to oppose the recommendations of the Lodha Committee
 jawaab main thakur ne kaha he ki unhone aisa nahin kiya
 Only the current ICC President Shashank Manohar was reminded of the statement which he had given as the BCCI President
 tab manohar ne kaha tha ki bisisiai main sieji ke pratinidhi kii niyukti kaamkaaj main sarkari dakhal he
 The comments thakur ke mutabik unhone sirf puraane bayaan ke aadhaar par spashtataa dene ko kaha tha
 They wanted to know whether the ICC would take any action against the BCCI

 Raising the question, Amicus Curiae had said that it is clear from the affidavit that he tried to have the ICC intervene in the BCCI reform

 unhone sifarish kii ki jab tak bisisiai main sudhaar puri tarah lagu nahin hote tab tak use kantrect tender dene yaa fund jari karne kaa kaam lodha kamity se puch kar karne ko kaha jaae
 Amicus Curiae Gopal Subramaniam had said that the BCCI and the State Cricket Association are the same
 sirf bhram failaane ke liye kaha ja rahaa he ki rajya sangh taiyaar nahin hai

 supreme court ne anuraag thakur se poocha tha ki unhone isisi ke siio david richardsan ko lodha kamity kii siforeeshon kaa virodh karne ke liye kaha tha yaa nahin
 In response, Thakur has said that he did not do so

 But a day before this match, the strictness shown by the Supreme Court against the BCCI can also have an effect on the performance of Team India
 itnaa hi nahin supreme court kii sunwaayee main team india ke captain kool em es dhoni kaa bhi naam aayaa
 Now the effect of all these will be seen in the match against Bangladesh, it will tell the time to come

 Home crowd will boost Bangladesh 
 
 bangladesh ke saath jo sabase bada adwantage he wo he home croud
 Defeating Afghanistan also boosts the morale of the host team
 haalanki home croud ke saamne hi team ko honkong or westeindies ke khilaaf haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Fielding and batting of Bangladesh remain a major concern
 4 maichon main team kaa ek bhi ballebaaj pachaasa nahin jad sakaa he or kai kaich bhi drop hue hai
 But in the midst of all this, it should not be forgotten that this is the same team that beat Team India in the 2007 World Cup

 50 rahaa he
 If Bangladesh is to upset Bangladesh against India, this player's role can be important

 Yuvi had taken a catch against the West Indies and also appeared breathless in batting
 yuvi par team or captain kool donon ko hi puraa bharosa he lekin ye bhi sach he ki unki kharaab form sabake liye chintaa banati ja rahi he
 Possible Playing XI: Bangladesh: Tamim Iqbal, Anamul Haq, Mominul Haq, Saqib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Shamsur Rahman / Sabir Rahman, Nasir Hussain / Mahmudullah, Giaur Rahman, Sohag Ghazi, Mashrafe Mortaza, Al Amin Hussain

 Interesting records associated with Team India: Yuvraj Singh is the only player from Team India who has won the Man of the Match award more than 2 times in T20
 amit mishra ne 3 maichon main hi 2 baar ye karnama kar dikhaaya he or yuvi kii barabari karne ke liye betaab hai
 Along with Amit Mishra, 5 more Indian cricketers have won the Man of the Match award twice
 bhubaneshwar kumaar ne tii-20 match main ek anokhaa record banaate hue 3 over main 3 ran die the
 Record of 6 sixes in an over is also recorded in the name of Yuvraj Singh

 Rohit Sharma said- 'of course this is our best chance to qualify for the semi-finals and we are not thinking much ahead

 ’ a total of 38 sixes were scored during the match with both teams hitting 19-19 sixes
 dhoni ne em chinnaswami stadium ke bare main kaha, ‘is maidan ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki yahaan ballebaaj chaukon se adhik chakke maarthe hai

 The openers got off to a good start
 viraat kohli ne acha pradarshan kiya
 Our batting order performed well

 Australian captain George Bailey said that his team had reached very close
 baili ne kaha, ‘ham kaaphi kareeb pahunch gaye the, lekin rohit ne shandaar pari kheli
 At one time we were probably in better shape but we did not have enough wickets
 fahonor or maxwell ne acchhee paariyaan kheli

 We knew it was going to be a big score match, so we kept wickets

 Things like power, stardom and fame are neither easy to maintain nor maintain
 bollywood ke aagaaj ke baad se kai aise stars rahe hai jo ye sab hasil karne main kaamyaab rahe
 The era of these stars came, they set a trend with establishing themselves in Bollywood, and then saw this stardom in front of them without any unwanted pass on

 ghayal hue, aarthik sankat se gujarey lekin har baar apane aapako sanbhaalane main kaamyaab rahe
 In the midst of such ups and downs, he has been humbly acknowledging his achievements and credited his success to the costars and directors
 usee vinamrata ke saath hi ve apane bangale par har ravivaar ko lagane vaali bheed kaa bhi abhivadan karte hai
 DDLJ may have moved out of Mumbai's theater after two decades, but the crowd, which came to Amitabh's house after forty years, still continues to come
 amitaryb bhi filmon kii main plot kaa hissaa hote or khaas taur par unke liye ab bhi role likhe jate hai
 He has now been transformed into a brand by stardom
 tivi kaa sabase zyada kaamyaab sho bhi host karte hai or 102 note out jaisi behad alag kism kii film ko 100 karod se zyada kamai bhi kara le jate he

 lekin in sabake bich wo artist kahin kho sa jaataa he, jise cinema se itnaa lagaav he ki wo marate dam tak rupahale parde kaa hissaa ho janaa chahta he

 sataha se hawa main maar karne vaali akaash missile (esaem) or pinaka multi bairal rocket launture hindustan ke us raksha falak par do chamakate hue sitare hai jahaan takreeban 70 fisadi raksha upkaran aayaat kiye jate hai
 This is because these two fully indigenous weapon platforms go even further than the NDA government's "make in India" program, as the design-owning foreign company merely adds equipment within the country
 iske baavjood ab ek saal se zyada hua, jab desh ke bheetar dizin, viksit or nirmit (ididm) in hathiyaar pranaaliyon ke liye 19,000 karod ru
 Orders over and above are stuck in the red tape of South Block
 zyada taadaad main akaash or pinaka pranaliyaan kharidne kaa sashastr balon kaa iraadaa abhi tak thekon main nahin badal paaya he
 The armed forces desperately need both of them
 akaash supersonic, harek mausam main sataha se hawa main maar karne vaali missile he jo 30 kilometre kii duuri tak dushman ke hawaii jahaaj, helicopter, drone or krooj mixilon ko daag sakati he
 The Indian Air Force needs Akash to protect airfields and critical bases
 30 saal se zyada pehle isane rus se pechora misile hasil kii thim, jinaki umr ab biit rahi he
 The Air Force needs six more Pinaka regiments to increase its firing capability
 18 loncharon kii ek pinaka regiment se mahaj ek dhamaakaa 35 kilometre dur ek varg kimi ke ilaake main asar kar saktaa he
 These indigenous weapon systems have shown many times more impact than their strength and this true capability has been achieved within Indian industries
 akaash pranali 96 fisadi swadeshi he or yah apane purje 330 hindustani udyogon se leti he
 At the same time, Pinaka is 92 percent indigenous and supports 43 Hindustani industries
 ye order itane achche-khaase hai or aage raksha paristhitiki par inkaa asar itnaa jabardast he ki nijee kshetra ke ek siio inhen bhartiya udyogon ke liye protsaahan package ke baraabar qaraar dete hai—aisi jabardast takat badhaane vaali khuraaq, jo oonchi technology ke kshetra main naukariyaan paidaa karegi, navachaar ko rakrataar degi or sarkaar ke liye baari taadaad main kar rajasav jutaayegi
 This is the reason why their absence is felt more due to the delay in ordering them
 yah bhi khaskar tab he jab sena ke liye teen duusari ahm or baari-bharkam ''mek in india" pariyojnaon kii sambhaavna itani dhundhlee he or un par tarakkee itani dhimi he ki udyog ne unke bare main phikr karnaa hi band kar diya he
 These projects are also meant for Indian industries as a whole, including both private and public sector industries

 They sought to create such consortiums of public and private sector industries that would develop indigenous samples and then produce them in large numbers

 Or these projects exceeding one percentage point of the country's GDP would promote and strengthen indigenous industry, especially the development of indigenous electronics, in the long run and accelerate the creation of jobs
 nijee kshetra ke ek siio kaa akalan he ki bhartiya udyog main kiye gaye har 1 karod ru
 The investment results of 25 jobs are visible in six high technology sectors and 20 in non-skilled areas

 L&T has taken responsibility for making all 100 cannons in the country and has transformed the "buy and Build" project into "make in India" project
 najdiki vakt main bhartiya udyog ko jo phayda aasaani se ho saktaa he, vah akaash or pinaka ke baar-baar milane vaale orderon se hi sambhav he
 But due to the bureaucratic lethality, now it seems that these orders are not going to get soon

 The same appears to be the fate of Akash
 vaayu sena ke liye 6,000 karod ru
 The order for seven fleet of Akash missiles, which is less than the cost of Rs
 15, is still waiting for the government to reach its end even after 15 months of the offer

 In a meeting held at the Air Force Headquarters in September, Air Force officials questioned the usefulness of the sky itself, especially when the Air Force is receiving five S-400 "triumph" SAM missiles from Russia, 400 km apart
 Are equipped with greater range firepower
 pariyojna se jude afasar bataate hai ki yah tulana hi bebuniyaad he
 Akash is the target defense missile while the S-400 is the field defense weapon
 akaash ekikrut niyantrit missile vikaas kaarykram (igmdipi) kaa hissaa he jo 1983 main shuru kiya gaya tha
 Its tests were completed in 2007, almost 24 years later

 The officials associated with the project estimate that at least half of the order amount will be returned to business within the country in the form of taxes and salary
 nijee kshetra ke ek siio kehete hai, ''aap sabase oonche staron par mulya badhaane kii baat kar rahe hai kyonki anusandhan or vikaas arthvyavastha main khud apana kai guna badhaane vaala asar paidaa karata he

 But with Parrikar's departure from South Block in March this year, the two indigenous systems lost their strong support and the bureaucratic latecomers pushed their purchases even further
 akaash bhi vivaadon se mukt nahin he
 a CAG report tabled in Parliament in July this year found that the missile's failure rate was 30 percent

 In the petition, Saeed has challenged two cases registered by the police against him
 said ke khilaaf police ne logon ko ‘jehad’ ke liye uksaane ke aarope main aatankwaad nirodhak adhinium ke tahat maamla darj kiya he

 Saeed is accused of inciting jihad outside the Lahore High Court, Saeed's lawyer AK Dogar told reporters that calling the JUD chief for jihad was not illegal because according to the Quran, such a move is necessary
 dogar ne daawa kiya ki jeyudi pratibandhit samooh nahin he or sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ne jo pratibandh us par lagaae hai ve pakistan jaise samprabhu desh main lagu nahin hote
 Dogar also claimed that India's allegation of Saeed's involvement in the Mumbai attacks was false

 dilli main pichley maah hue sansanikhej gangrape or hatya ke maamle main police ne kul chah main paanch aropiyon ke khilaaf guuruuvaar ko chargeshit daayar kar di, lekin chathe abhiyukt par philhal koi aarope nahin lagaaya gaya he, kyonki uskaa daawa he ki vah naaballig he
 His bones have been tested to investigate his claim, and if he proves to be a minor, he will be tried in a juvenile court, and he can be sentenced to a maximum of three years in prison, and that too in prison
 No, it will have to be cut by staying in the Reformation Hall
 darasal, 16 disambar kii raat ko peedit ladki jab apane ek purush mitra ke saath film dekhakar ghar laut rahi thi, ve ek bas main savaar hue, jisamen in chah logon ne un par dhaava bol diya, or baari-baari se ladki ke saath balaatkaar karne ke baad lohe ke sariye se unhen na sirf peeta, balki ladki ke sharir main saria ghusaa bhi diya, jisase ghayal hone kii vajah se hi 13 din baad singapore ke ek aspataal main uski maut bhi ho gai
 The irony of this case is that this sixth accused, who is not presently named in the chargesheet, was the most atrocious towards the victim girl
 police sutron ne enditivi ko jaankaree di he ki chargeshit main is kathith naaballig abhiyukt par aupchaarik aarope nahin lagaae gaye hai, lekin uski harkaton kaa zikr kiya gaya he
 According to sources, the same accused raped the girl twice, and did one of them at a time when the girl was unconscious
 iske alaava isi ladke ne apane haathon se ladki kii antadiyon ko baahar khinch nikaala tha, or isi abhiyukt ne peedit ladki or uske mitra ko chalati bas se neeche phenk dene kaa suzav diya tha
 The comments bataaya jaataa he ki peedit ladki kaa purush mitra apni choton se ubar chukaa he, or uske parivaar ke kareebi ek vakil ne jaankaree di he ki vah is baat ke liye apil karegaa, ki is naaballig abhiyukt par bhi vayask abhiyukton ke saath hi mukadmaa chalaaya jaae
 Whereas according to sources, Delhi Police will wait for the results of the test of his bones before filing a report against this minor accused in the Juvenile Justice Board
 yadi is test se siddh hota he ki abhiyukt naaballig nahin he or uski umr 18 saal se adhik he, to poorak aaropapatr (supplementry chargeshit) daakhil kii jaaegi
 But if he proves to be a minor, then the police will file a report in the Juvenile Justice Board, and after that action will be initiated against this accused
 lekin sabase badi vidmbana yahi he ki aisa hone par is sabase zyaada nrushans rahe aaropee ko adhiktam teen saal kii sazaa di ja sakegi, vah bhi sudhargrih main, kyonki naaballigon par hatya kaa mukadmaa nahin chalaaya ja saktaa
 In fact, on the night of 16 December, when the victim was returning home after watching a movie with a male friend, they boarded a bus in which these six men attacked her, and in turn raped the girl
 After doing this, he not only beaten them with an iron bar, but also inserted a barley into the girl's body, due to which she died 13 days later in a hospital in Singapore
 is maamle kii vidmbana yah he ki yahi chatha abhiyukt, jiskaa naam philhal chargeshit main nahin he, peedit ladki ke prati sabase zyaada nrushans rahaa tha
 Police sources have informed NDTV that the chargesheet has not made formal allegations against the alleged minor accused, but his antics have been mentioned
 sutron ke anusaar, isi abhiyukt ne ladki ke saath do baar balaatkaar kiya, or unamem se ek baar to us samay kiya, jab ladki behosh ho chuki thi
 Also the same boy pulled out the girl's entrails with his hands, and the same accused suggested throwing the victim girl and her friend down from the moving bus
 tippaniyan The male friend of the victim's girl is said to have recovered from her injuries, and a lawyer close to her family has informed that he will appeal that the minor accused be prosecuted along with the adult accused
 Go jabaki sutron ke anusaar dilli police is naaballig abhiyukt ke khilaaf juvenil justise board main report daayar karne se pehle uski haddiyon ke test ke nattejey aane kaa intazaar karegi
 If this test proves that the accused is not a minor and is over 18 years of age, then a supplementary charge sheet will be filed
 parantu yadi vah naaballig hi sabit hota he to police juvenil justise board main report daakhil karegi, auki uske baad is abhiyukt ke viruddh karrwai shuru hogi
 But the biggest irony is that if this happens, the most brutal accused can be punished for a maximum period of three years, that too in the correctional house, because minors cannot be prosecuted for murder

 The Knight Riders also had a bad third year in a row and with this defeat their chances of reaching the semi-finals are almost over
 uske 12 match main 10 ank hai jabaki chennai ke itane hi match main 12 ank ho gayi hai or vah behatar rangati ke kaaran ankatalika main duusare number par pahunch gaya he
 If it is left to win the toss then nothing is good for KKR in the whole match
 pehle aswin ne kahar barapaaya or keval 16 ran dekar teen wicket lekar pratidwandvi team kaa score chaar wicket par 19 ran kar diya
 Angelo Mathews (48) tried to finish the innings with Manoj Tiwari (27) but still the team could manage 139 runs for eight wickets
 mathew heden jab pehle over main out ho gayi to laga ki muqabla kadaa ho saktaa he lekin raina ko to bas katleam ke mood main utre the
 The left-hander hit the shot where he wished in the field and made 78 not out off 39 balls with 11 fours and three sixes to his team's 13
 3 over main ek wicket par 143 ran par pahunchaa diya
 He shared an unbroken partnership of 137 runs in 13 overs with Murali Vijay (50 off 40 balls), also the biggest partnership in the IPL for the second wicket

 The match is very important for both the Knight Riders and Super Kings but Sourav Ganguly's team debut was shocking for any KKR fan
 mahendra singh dhoni ne phir se aswin se gendbaaji kaa aagaaj karavaaya or is of spinner ne 16 ran ke evaj main teen wicket lekar kahar barapaane main der nahin lagaayi
 Ganguly hit two fours in Doug Bollinger's second over and then Chris Gayle sent the first ball of Ashwin's second over for a six on long on
 yahaan tak lag rahaa tha ki keker ke liye sab kuch sahi chal rahaa he lekin agali gend se aisa pasa palata ki em e chidambaram stadium main sirf aswin ke naam kii gunj sunai dene lagi
 Ashwin took the ball off Gayle and Dhoni did not take long to stump him
 isi over kii antim gend par brandan maikulam ne galat timming se sweep shaat khelkar muthya muralidharan ko kaich de baithe
 Now where Bollinger was going to stay behind and he trapped Ganguly in the next over
 ampire sanjay hajaare ke faisle ko riple galat bataa rahaa tha kyonki gend leg stump se baahar ja rahi thi lekin ab kuch nahin ho saktaa tha
 Kolkata Knight Riders captain Sourav Ganguly on Tuesday decided to bat by winning the toss against Chennai Super Kings in a crucial Indian Premier League match
 donon hi tiimon ke liye yah match behad mahatvapurn he kyonki jo bhi team haaregi uski semifinal main pahunchane kii sambhaavna samaapt ho jaaegi
 Chennai have played 11 matches so far in which they have won in five while they have lost in 6 matches
 vahiin, kolkata kii bhi sthiti kuch aisi hi he
 Both teams have ten points in the points table and both have to win this match to reach the semi-finals

 For 23 years, the SP and the BSP, who have not tasted each other's eyes, have forgotten all the rivalry and come together
 gorakhpur or phulpur upachunaav ke liye mayawati ne akhilesh yadav ke sapa ummidavaar ko samarthan dene kaa elaan kiya he
 At the same time, Akhilesh Yadav can give Mayawati a return gift of Rajya Sabha instead
 sapa-basapa kaa kareeb aana kisi ajoobe se kam nahibispi or samaajawaadee party kaa yun kareeb aana upi kii raajnneeti ke liye badi baat he
 However, the signs of this were started only after the results of the assembly elections last year, in which the BJP had caused tremendous damage to both these parties
 vaise sapa or basapa kii dushmani koi aisi-waisi nahin thi
 After what happened in the guest house scandal in 1995, the coming together of the two parties is no less than a wonder in itself
 ye he deal kaa formulagorakhpur or phulpur loksabhaa upachunaav main bijepi ummidavaar ko maat dene ke liye sapa ummidavaaron ko basapa samarthan karegi
 Apart from this, BSP supremo Mayawati has clearly said that the SP will support the BSP in the Rajya Sabha elections and instead the party will help the SP in the Legislative Council
 mayawati-akhilesh main nahin hui batsapa or basapa ke bich samjhaute kii kavayad 27 farvari se kii ja rahi thi
 It was announced after 6 days of hard work and extensive talks between the leaders of both the parties
 haalanki mayawati or akhilesh yadav ke bich aapas main baat nahin hui he
 According to the sources, only talks were held between SP general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav and BSP general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra
 iske baad mayawati or akhilesh yadav ne sirf hari jhandi di, jiske baad elaan kiya gaya
 Mayawati had resigned from the Rajya Sabha
 Let us know that in July last year, Mayawati resigned from the Rajya Sabha membership because of the Saharanpur case
 haalanki, unka kaarykaal is saal april ko khatm ho rahaa he
 Elections for up's 10 Rajya Sabha seats are scheduled on March 23, including Mayawati's seat
 vipakshi dalon main sapa ko chhodkar baaki koi dal apane boote kisi ko rajyasabha bhejne kii haisiyat main nahin hairajyasabha kaa siyaasi samikarnrajyasabha pahunchane ke liye kam se kam 37 voton kii jarurat hogi
 BJP easily has the strength to win 8 of its candidates
 sapa ke paas 47 vidhayak hai
 Together with Mayawati's 19 mlas, the number reaches 66
 7 vidhayak congress ke paas bhi hai, jinhen milakar vipaksh ke paas 73 vot ho rahe hai
 In such a situation, the SP will win one seat easily and the entire opposition together will try for the other
 vipaksh ko chahie kitne votvipaksh ko duusare sanyukt ummidavaar ke liye teen-chaar vidhayakon kii jarurat padegi
 In such a situation, the battle for the 10th seat is being considered
 kyonki nirdaleeyon ke samarthan sahit apane 8 rajyasabha sadsy jitaane ke baad bhi bijepi ke paas kareeb 32 vot duusari seat ke liye bachenge
 The opposition will also have about the same number of votes
 aise main duusari seat ke liye dilachasp muqabla hoga
 Mayawati ran from UP to MP
 Teramayavati has also put pressure on the Congress through this bet
 'ek haath de or duusare haath le' kii baat kahkar mayawati ne ye saaf kar diya he
 The Congress is compelled that in the Lok Sabha, it cannot go much further than both to face the BJP
 rajyasabha main congress ke 7 vidhayakon ke samarthan ke liye dabaav banaate hue mayawati ne kaha he ki jab hamen upi main samarthan milegaa, tabhi empi main bispi rajyasabha chunaav main congress kaa saath degi
 RJD had offered to send brother Anand Kumar to Rajya Sabha from Bihar
 par pradesh chhodana unhen gavaara nahin tha
 In such a situation, he took the most favorable SP to preserve his political standing
 aise main wo sapa ko ek haath se de rahi hai duusari haath se le rahi hai
 It is also discussed that Mayawati can send brother Anand Kumar to Rajya Sabha instead

 On this issue, BJP has said that RJD has been of criminal character whether it is Lalu Yadav's time or Tejaswi's

 The picture of Rajaballabh Yadav shows that Tejashwi is walking on the same path on which Lalu Yadav used to walk

 It is evident that the party has put up his poster

 The size of the photo of Tejashwi Yadav or his family in the poster looks very small, but the picture of Rajaballabh Yadav is looking big

 a man tried to bribe Union Human Resources Minister Kapil Sibal
 ranchi ke shaks ne maanav sansaadhan mantralay main khat ke saath lipapha bhejkar central uniwarsity jharkhand kaa register banane kii maang kii thi
 The case is being seen as a conspiracy and mischief
 anna ke andolan par vishesh kaverejksha kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri kapil sibbal ko sajeesh main fansaane kii koshish hui? kya sibbal ke saath sharaarat kii gai? ye atakalein shuru hui hai ek lakh rupee ke ek check se jo ranchi ke ek shaks ne kapil sibbal ko bheja tha
 On 23 August last, the Ministry of Human Resources received an envelope, inside which there was a check of one lakh rupees and a letter
 check bhejne vaale ne apana naam omprakash likhaa he or wo ranchi ke dhurva ilaake kaa rahane vaala he
 Know what is Jan Lokpal? This PD check of Canara Bank, whose number is 361296, has been issued in the name of Ministry of Human Resources, but above the envelope is the name of Kapil Sibal
 check ke badale omprakash ne khud ko central uniwarsity jharkhand kaa register yaa dipti register bana dene kii guzarish kii thi
 Click here to watch Aaj Tak LIVE TV, when the check reached the Ministry of Human Resources, at that time Anna Hazare's movement was at its peak and Kapil Sibal was the target
 sawaal uthta he ki kya is check is maamle se koi lenaa-dena he? mantralay ke joint secetry amit khare ne sansad maarg thane main check bhejnevaale shaks ke khilaaf bhrashtachar nirodhak adhinium ke tahat maamla darj kar liya he
 See: Whatever the stand of Human Resource Minister Kapil Sibal regarding the 40 scam Lokpal Bill in 64 years, due to the conflict with Team Anna, many people have come to know him as a big opponent of this bill
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki unke mantralay main ek lakh rupee kii rishwat kaa chack bhijwa kar is shaks ne unhen ek jhatka dene kii koshish kii he
 It is another matter that now after sending an FIR in the police, only the person sending the check can get a shock
 dilli main bason ke baad dilliwaalon kii lifline bani metro jald hi logon kaa jhatka de sakati he
 According to the news from the sources, the Delhi Metro is likely to increase the fares by more than double
 philhal dilli metro main adhiktam kiraaya 30 rupee hai jise badhaakar 70 rupee kiye jane kii sanstuti kii gai he
 Let me tell you that at present, at least 8 rupees have to be paid in Delhi Metro, which is being said to be increased to 10 rupees
 is bare main dmarsi fere phikseshan kamity ke pramukh emel mehta se jab baat kii gai to unka kahana tha ki somvaar ko vah is bare main zyada baat karenge
 He made it clear that the proposal for metro has come up
 is prastaav main kam se kam 10 rupaya or adhiktam 70 rupaya kiraaya karne kaa prastaav he
 Behind this increase, the Metro says that maintenance costs, operational costs and staff salaries have increased significantly
 tippaniyan Metro says that DMRC has taken a loan of thousands of crores from Japan's Jaica company
 iske alaava or bhi lone hai
 For whose payment it has become necessary to increase income
 metro kaa yah bhi kahana he ki uske munaafe main kami ai he
 Please tell that the fare of the metro has been increased three times before
 agar is prastaav ko manjuuri milti he to chauthaa mauka hoga jab kiraaya badhaayaa jayega
 According to the information, the fare has not been increased since 2009
 metro ne kiraaya badhaane ke liye sarkaar ke paas kai baar reminder bhi bheje hai
 When the matter was discussed with MLR Mehta, the head of DMRC Fair Fixation Committee, he said that he will talk more about it on Monday
 unhone saaf kiya ki badhotaree ko lekar metro kaa prastaav aayaa he
 In this offer, it is proposed to rent at least 10 rupees and maximum 70 rupees
 is badhotaree ke peeche metro kaa kahana he ki mantenence cost, oparational cost or staff ke vetan-bhatte kaaphi bad gaye hai
 The comments metro kaa kahana he ki japan kii jaika (jaica) company se dmarsi ne hajaaron karod kaa rin liya hua he
 Apart from this, there are more loans
 jinke bhugtan ke liye aay badhanaa jaruri ho gaya he
 Metro also says that its profits have come down
 bataa den ki teen baar pehle bhi metro kaa kiraaya badhaayaa gaya he
 If this proposal is approved, there will be a fourth time when the fare will be increased
 jaankaree ke anusaar 2009 ke baad se kiraye main badhotaree nahin kii gai he
 Metro has also sent reminders to the government several times to increase the fare

 supreme court ne ayodhya maamle main faisla sunayasunni vakf board ne faisle ke baad baithak bulaai15 din main baithak kar 5 acre zamin par faisla sambhakyodhya ke ramajnmabhumi-babari masjid vivaad par supreme court kaa faisla aane ke baad pakshakaron ne isapar manthan karnaa shuru kar diya he
 On behalf of the Muslim side, chairman of the Sunni Waqf Board, Zafar Farukhi has said that the board meeting will be called soon, which will take place within 15 days
 unke anusaar, is baithak main paanch acre jameen lene ke maamle par nirnay liya jayega
 Significantly, in the decision given by the Supreme Court on Saturday, the disputed place was given to Ramlala Virajman, while the decision was made to give 5 acres of land in Ayodhya to the Muslim side
 iske alaava supreme court ne faisle main nirmohi akhaada or shiya vakf board ke daavon ko khaarij kar diya tha
 In this first meeting to be held after the Ayodhya dispute, the government may also discuss other interests of Muslims
 sunni vakf board apane pehle ke samjhaute vaale masaude par bhi charchaa karegaa, saath hi muslim paksh ke dharmik sthalon kii suraksha, ibaadat ke adhikaar par baat kii jaaegi
 Let us tell you that a five-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi gave a historic verdict on Saturday on this ongoing dispute for years
 jiske tahat muslim paksh vivaadit sthaan par apana haq sabit karne main naakaam rahaa he, yahi kaaran he ki zamin ramalala virajman ko di gai
 When the verdict came on Saturday, it was said by the Sunni Waqf Board that they would not file a review petition in the case
 faisle ke baad sunni vakf board ke chairman jafar faruki ne bayaan diya tha ki hamane pehle hi kaha tha ki sarvocch adaalat kaa jo faisla aayega, use dil se mana jayega
 For this reason no petition will be filed again
 haalanki, ol india muslim personal lau board paksh ke zafaryaab jilani ne kaha tha ki vah supreme court ke faisle se santusht nahin hai, lekin vah sarvocch adaalat ke faisle kaa sammaan karte hai
 The country's largest state-run bank, State Bank of India, has reduced interest rates on deposits
 iske baad sabhi saavadhi jamaa yani epady par milane vaale byaaj main kami aegi
 It will also have an impact on those fds for five years which are done for the purpose of saving tax
 share bazaar tut rahaa he, jiske kaaran mutual fund ke ritern bhi aakarshith karte nahin dikh rahe
 The property market is in dire straits so options for investment become more limited
 aise main ek chote niveshak ke saamne sawaal yah he ki achche ritern ke liye aakhir jaaen to kahaan jaaen? kyonki ielandef or dewan houseing ke ghatnakram ke baad to yah bhi nahin kah sakate ki date main laga paisa surakshit he
 The total deposit is that where there is no risk, the returns are limited and where the returns are expected to be good, the risks are big
 nivesh ke liye ranneeti banane se pehle kitni avadhi ke liye nivesh kiya ja rahaa he, iskaa dhyaan rakhana behad jaruri he
 This is because if you invest the money that you want back in a short time, then it may be that a large part of your capital is absorbed in the current market movement
 aise main agar aapako kam samay ke liye nivesh karnaa he to acchhee company yaa bank ke date fund aapke liye behatar opshan ho sakate hai
 Look at the ratings it has received before investing in a fund
 ucch reating vaale bond main jokhim kam hone ke kaaran ritern bhale kam ho lekin aapaki puunji surakshit rahegi
 Similarly, if you are planning to invest for the medium term, then post office savings schemes, Kisan Vikas Patra, index funds may be good options for you
 portpholio kaa diversyphoid hona jaruri he
 Stock market is a better option for long term now
 lekin nivesh sidhe na karke mutual fund ke raste hona chahie
 An investment strategy should be formed by creating a good synergy between PPF, Sukanya Samriddhi schemes and mutual funds
 kisi ek nivesh vikalp par puri tarah nirbharta sahi nahin
 Apart from this, take financial advisor's help on issues like insurance, regular investment according to the target

 lekin jab aapaki umr 30 saal ho jaae to aapke andar kuch bade badlaav aate hai
 By now you have decided what you want from life
 ye umr faisla lene kii hoti he
 Whether it is about marriage or career
 aaie jaanate hai ve badlaav jo 30 saal kii umr ke baad aate hai
 There is a saying that self-confidence is not that everyone likes you but it is that you do not care about someone's likes and dislikes
 30 saal kii umr tak yah paripakvata aa jaati he ki aap kisi se alag nahin hai balki bheed kaa ek hissaa hai
 If someone does not like you, then you are not disappointed but you move forward in life
 mahilaon main partner ko chunane ko lekar sajagata aa jaati he
 By the age of 18-24, most girls have had fights with their boyfriends
 ye anubhav unhen ladako ko samajhane main madad karte hai
 At the age of 30, he comes to know which boy is your mood and which is not
 20 se 25 saal tak ke rishte main ham apane partner ko bahut pyaar karte hai
 The two bodies follow the notion of having one life, but when the eye opens, we realize that the Akalis have come and have to go alone
 sahi bhi he aap tabhi duusare kaa khyaal rakh paaengi jab aap swasth or prasann hon
 By the age of 30, we learn to love ourselves
 rishte main dhairya bahut jaruri he
 When there are quarrels at the age of 20 to 25 years, instead of resolving them, couples start thinking about ending the relationship, while at the age of 30, the ideas become mature
 ek duusare ko chhodane ke bajaay shanti se baithkar hal nikaalane kii koshish karte hai
 Can't sleep again after breaking? Do this work at the age of 20, perhaps the most qualified partner for you will be the one who has studied from a large university, but by the time you reach the age of 30, you know that studying has nothing to do with success
 safal vahi hota he jisamen lagan hoti he
 No, these 8 problems of a relationship can happen! At 20-25 years of age, we pay a lot of attention to height, we think that the height of a boy is 6 feet and that of girls is at least 5
 8 to ho hi
 But by the age of 30, this perception changes and you realize that love is more important than height

 Every day you see big rallies, you may have seen the helicopters of the leaders while campaigning, but today we are going to tell you the story of "parsiya Tole", a Mushar village in Kushinagar, Uttar Pradesh, where there are neither pucca houses nor foot slippers Neither is education, it is only sad
 kushinagar shahar se 15 kilometre dur sthit he parasia tolaa gaanv
 This village is a village of very backward caste Mushars
 samaaj ne inako samvidhan ne barabari kaa darza to dilaa diya he par ab bhi ye samaaj kii mukhya dhara se dur garibi or fatehali main apana jivan jeene ko majaboor hai kyonki is gaanv ke kisi bhi musahar ke paas apni zamin nahin he, isliye ye duusare gaanv ke logon ke kheton main mazaduri karne ko majaboor hai
 In this village we met Naresh Mushar
 naresh kii umr 20 saal he or paas ke eent ke bhatthe main mazaduri karte hai, maa baap garib the to inhen padhaa nahin paae
 When we asked Naresh that there are elections, you know, he nodded yes
 phir hamane unase poocha ki kisi netaa kaa naam yaad he to naresh ne kaha, 'nahin babuji, dinabhar mazaduri karata hum, netaaon ke bare main nahin jaanata
 It is a big surprise that Naresh living in the world of whatsapp and Facebook knows neither Modi nor Akhilesh
 tippaniyan Neither the Ujjwala scheme of PM nor the Samajwadi Pension Scheme of Akhilesh government has reached this village
 yahaan mahilaayein kachche chuulhe main hi khaanaa banaati hai or kuch to eent rakh kar hi chulhaa banaae hue hai
 Not a single child of this village goes to school because if there is money for bread, then where did the money for studies come from? baccha thodaa bada hota he to apane baap ke saath mazaduri karne lagata he
 The women of the village say that the master removes the children from school if they do not pay the fees
 300 logon ke gaanv main ek bhi shauchalay nahin he or pani ke naam par sirf ek handpump
 Here people do not even have a bed to sleep, people are running some kind of work by making a pallet bed
 kushinagar main lagbhag 86 musahar gaanv hai jahaan kamobesh yahi haalat he

 If you bowl under the limits, then you can still play cricket and bowl another or any other

 Sri Lanka's team batting first after losing the toss 48
 3 over main 208 ran par simat gai
 In response, Gayle's innings, studded with 9 fours and 7 sixes, helped the West Indies easily reach the target with 73 balls to spare
 gail kaa yah 21waan vanade shatak or gharelu maidan par teesraa shatak tha
 After Gayle's dismissal, the West Indies needed 28 runs in 19 overs but lost two more wickets
 captain dwen braavo or marlon sampuls ne 73 gend shesh rahete jeet dilaa di jisase ek bonus ank bhi mila
 Gayle shared a 115-run partnership for the first wicket with Johnson Charles (29)
 gail ne shuru main krij par paanv jamaane ko tarjeeh di or baad main apni khyaati ke anuroop bade shot khele
 He sent Nuwan Kulasekara for 4 runs from the cover area and in the eighth over, the same bowler hit successive balls of deep midwicket and six off long off
 isse pehle unhone ajanta mendis kii gend bhi unke sir ke upar se chah ran ke liye bheji thi
 Gayle also hit sixes over Lesith Malinga and Matthews
 unhone baayen haath ke spinner rangana herath ko bhi nahin bakhsha or unki lagaataar gendon ko chaar or chah ran ke liye bheja
 Meanwhile, the second opener, Charles, struggled to score runs
 unhone mendis par chakka jadne ke baad duusare spinner rangana herath kii gend bhi chah ran ke liye bhejkar apane strike rate main sudhaar kiya
 Charles, however, waved Herath's next ball into the air
 isse pehle srilanka acchhee shuruyaat kaa phayda nahin uthaa paaya or usne niyamit antaraal main wicket ganvaae
 Skipper Angelo Mathews took advantage of the early life and scored an unbeaten 55 off 77 balls
 unke alaava anbhavi mahela jayavardhane (52) hi upyogi yogadan de paae
 For the West Indies, off-spinner Narayan took four wickets for 40 runs while Rampal spent 38 runs and sent three batsmen to the pavilion
 captain dwen braavo ne 37 ran dekar do wicket hasil kiye
 Jayawardene and Upul Tharanga (25) shared a 62-run partnership for the first wicket to give Sri Lanka a good start
 kemar roach ko in donon ne hi shuru main nishane par rakhaa
 Jayawardene hit two fours in his two consecutive overs
 roach ne pehla over madan kiya lekin pehle spel ke agle teen over main unhone 28 ran lutaae
 West Indies first success was given by Dwayne Bravo
 duusare badlaav ke rup main aaye braavo kii baahar jaati gend ko tharanga ne kadamon kaa istemaal kiye bina khilne kii koshish kii lekin vah balle kaa kinaaraa lekar wicketiper dinesh ramdin ke dastaanon main samaa gai
 This affected the run pace and put Sri Lanka in trouble by dismissing both key batsmen Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara (17) as Narayan held the ball
 is of spinner ke pehle over main jayavardhane ne wicketiper ko aasaan kaich thamaya
 He had earlier completed his 70th ODI half-century with a reverse sweep in the same over of Narayan
 jayavardhane ne apni pari main 52 gend kheli or saat chauke lagaae
 Sangakkara did not last long
 unhone narayan kii flite leti gend ko deele balle se khelaa or extra cover par kaich de diya
 Roach would have got the wicket of Matthews in his second spell but Gayle dropped his catch at slip
 maithyuj ne tab 7 ran banaaye the
 Mathews played fine after that and despite falling wickets at the other end, he kept on scoring
 unhone apni pari main paanch chauke lagaae
 Dinesh Chandimal (21) hit a six over Samuels but returned to the pavilion after catching a long shot off the same all-rounder
 rampal ne ballebaaji powerple ke apane pehle do over main lahiru thirimane (6) or nuwan kulshekhara (2) ko out karke srilanka ko hilaakar rakh diya
 Jeevan Mendis (5) came to bat at number eight but he too could not stop the fall of wickets
 narayan ne apane duusare spel main aate hi unhen deep squaire leg main aasaan kaich thamane ke liye majaboor kiya
 Mathews completed his 15th ODI half-century off 72 balls but tail-enders Lesith Malinga (8) and Ajanta Mendis could not support him much

 Sushma Swaraj, the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha and BJP candidate from Vidisha Parliamentary seat in this Lok Sabha election, returned to the helipad here today without being addressed by the electoral assembly, angered by a big leader not taking them
 sushamaa ke aane kii soochna kii vajah se aaj dopaher baarah baje se hi helleypad par media kaa jamaavada tha or do baje kii sabha ke liye sushamaa kaa helicopter thik 1
 Landed at Shivpuri at 45, but there was no BJP leader present to take them there
 yahaan tak ki party kaa koi vaahan bhi helleypad par sushamaa ko sabhasthal par le jane ke liye nahin aayaa tha
 a bolero vehicle of the 'carcade' which the administration had prepared for their safety stood there, on which 'skart-
 ’ likhaa hua tha
 Sushma felt that due to the code of conduct the administration would have allowed only one vehicle, she sat in that vehicle
 jab kuch dur vaahan chalaa, to unhen us par likhe ‘scort-
 'when in doubt, they asked the driver
 unhen bataaya gaya ki yah unke ‘karcade’ kaa pehla vaahan he
 The Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha immediately asked her to take her back to the helipad and when she reached the helipad, Shivpuri Municipality President and District General Secretary reached there and tried to persuade her
 unhone donon netaaon se poocha ki guna-shivpuri sansadeey kshetra ke bhaajapa pratyaashee jaybhaan singh pavaiya kahaan hai, jab unhen mobile lagaaya gaya, to unhone use nahin uthaaya
 This angered Sushma even more
 unhen bataaya gaya ki pavaiya is samay ashokanagar main hai
 Sushma said that when the candidate is not bothered about her election meeting, why did she go to the meeting, she sat in the helicopter and left

 Sulabh International made 565 kg laddus in 2015 when Modi was 65 years old and now Modi is 69 years old
 isliye 569 kilo kaa laddu banaaya gaya he
 On this occasion, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said that hardly anyone around the world would have happened, whose birthday would have been celebrated on such a large scale
 pradhanmantri modi ke janmdin ko swatchta diwas manaae jane par gajendra singh shekhavat kaa kahana he ki 2014 main kisi ne kalpana nahin kii hogi jab pradhanmantri ne svachh bharat abhiyaan kii ghoshnaa kii ki desh ko paanch saal main khule main shouch se mukt kiya ja saktaa he

 For the third phase of Lok Sabha elections in Bihar, the areas of Mithilanchal and Seemanchal are very important according to the Yadav and Muslim voters, because it is from these seats that only the leaders reach Parliament on the basis of M-Y factor
 khud ko muslim or yadavon kii hitaishi bataane vaale teen bade netaa lalu yadav, sharad yadav, or pappu yadav ne yaheen se apni chunavi jeet kii shuruuaat kii
 At present, three of these five seats are held by Araria, Madhepura, and Supaul Mahagathbandhan, while the seats of Jhanjharpur and Khagaria are in the nda's court
 in paanch saalon main desh main jis tareeke kaa maahaul bana he, usase yah kahana galat nahin hoga ki yah chunaav endie or mahagathbandhan donon ke liye chunauteepurn he, kyonki is charan main donon hi partiyon ke bich apni-apni seat bachaane kii hode machi he
 Both factions do not want to lose their seats under any circumstances
 bihar kii paanch siten supaul, arriya, madhepura, khagadiya or jhanjharpur loksabhaa seat par matdaan 23 april ko hona he
 Supaulsupaul is one of the high profile Lok Sabha seats in Bihar
 saal 2008 main parisemen ayog kii siforeeshon ke baad is loksabhaa seat ko gathit kiya gaya
 For the first time, voting was held here for the Lok Sabha elections in 2009
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main is baar congress or endie gathbandhan ke bich kaante kaa muqabla he
 While the Congress has fielded Ranjit Ranjan in the electoral arena, the JDU has once again made Dileshwar Kamait its candidate
 is seat se 7 nirdaleey ummidavaar samet kul 20 ummidavaar chunavi maidan main hai
 Significantly, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Ranjit Ranjan of the Congress was first with 21 percent of the vote
 jabaki jadyu ke dileshwar kamait 17 fisadi vot ke saath duusare number par, to bhaajapa pichley chunaav main modi lahar ke baavjood 16 fisadi vot ke saath tisare number par thi
 There are many problems in Supaul that have not been solved till date
 kuch pramukh muddon main rail seva kaa na hona, rojgaar ke mudde, har saal lakhon logon kaa palaayan hona, krishi aadhaarit ek bhi udyog na hona
 Apart from this, there are many other issues in this region which is facing the Kosi tragedy
 arriyabihar kaa arriya loksabhaa seat muslim bahul ilaaka or yadavon kaa garh hone ke kaaran ek mahatvapurn seat mana jaataa he
 It is a part of Seemanchal region
 yahaan 45 fisadi se zyada muslim or yadav matadaata hai
 The Rashtriya Taslimuddin won the 2014 Lok Sabha elections by the Muslim and Yadav votes
 lekin taslimuddin ke nidhan ke baad yah seat khaali ho gai or march 2018 main yahaan upachunaav karaae gaye
 In which RJD candidate and Taslimuddin's son Sarfaraz Alam won
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke liye bhaajapa se pradeep kumaar singh, rajd se sarfaraj alam, bispi se ram narayan bharti, bahujan mukti party se tarachand paswan or bihar lok nirmaan dal se sudama singh chunavi maidan main apni kishmat aajamaa rahe hai
 Araria is also a flood affected area
 baadh prabhavit is ilaake main rojgaar or naukari ke liye palaayan sabase badi samasya he
 The Madhepura Lok Sabha seat of Madhepurbihar is considered to be the stronghold of the Yadavs, as the future of its leaders depends on the vote of the Yadavs
 isiilie madhepura main ek kahawat mashhoor he, 'rome pope kaa, madhepura gop kaa'
 Madhepura has also been a stronghold of Lalu Yadav at one time
 rajd chif lalu yadav do baar madhepura seat se loksabhaa chunaav jeet chuke hai
 Pappu Yadav alias Rajesh Ranjan contested this seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections on a RJD ticket
 haalanki, baad main pappu yadav rajd se alag ho gaye or unhone apni alag party bana lee
 Pappu Yadav 21 in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 38 fisadi vot mili
 Then Sharad Yadav was in front of him on a JDU ticket
 sharad yadav ko 18
 12 percent votes were received
 jabaki bhaajapa ke vijay kumaar singh 14
 It was third with 63 per cent of the votes
 lekin ab maamla bilkul alag he
 a total of 10 candidates are in the fray for this seat in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 jahaan sharad yadav rajd se, dinesh chandra yadav jadyu se, or rajesh ranjan urf pappu yadav apni hi party jan adhikaar party se chunaav lard rahe hai
 The history of Jhanjharpur Lok Sabha seat located in Mithilanchal district of Jhanjharpur Bihar is quite interesting
 kosi or kamala nadi kii god main basaa jhanjharpur ilaaka darbhanga jile kaa hissaa he, lekin yahaan lagaataar alag jile kii maang ho rahi he
 From the same area, the former Chief Minister of Bihar, Dr
 jagannatha mishra jitkar sansad pahunche the
 Currently, bjp's Birendra Kumar Chaudhary is the MP from here
 gauratlab he ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main pehali baar bhaajapa ko is seat se jeet mili thi
 Where BJP candidate Birendra Kumar Chaudhary 20
 11 fisadi, rajd ke ummidavaar mangani laal mandal ko 16
 79 per cent and 11 to JDU candidate Devendra Prasad Yadav after breaking away from BJP
 01 fisadi vot mili the
 For the 2019 Lok Sabha seat, this seat has now gone into the account of JDU, the nda's partner party
 is seat se jadyu se ramprit mandal, argedy se gulab yadav, shivasena se ramanand thakur or bahujan samaaj party se raaj kumaar singh chunavi maidan main hai
 a total of 17 candidates are trying their luck from this seat
 jhanjharpur krishi ke najariye se kaaphi ahm kshetra mana jaataa he
 The biggest problem here is that this area is often hit by floods during the rainy days
 khagadiyaloksabhaa chunaav ke maddenjar khagadiya seat par suspence bana hua he
 There is a curiosity in the minds of the people here to know who will go to the vote of the Yadavs in this Yadav dominated area
 kyonki is baar dinesh chandra yadav madhepura se chunaav lard rahe hai vahiin krishna kumari yadav chunaav maidan se baahar ho gai he
 It is believed that this is the first time from this seat that despite being a Yadav dominated constituency, there is no Yadav candidate in the electoral battle
 yahi kaaran he ki endie or mahagathbandhan dono hi yadav votaron ko apni ore rijhaane main jute hai
 This time the matter is different than the previous time, because JDU is with NDA, while Upendra Kushwaha's party RLSP and Jitan Ram Manjhi's Hum Party are contesting elections together with the Grand Alliance
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main lok jan shakti party ke pratyaashee choudhary mehboob ali kaisar, bahujan samaaj party se ramakant choudhary chunavi maidan main hai
 a total of 20 candidates are contesting from this seat
 gauratlab he ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main kul 59
 49 percent voting was done
 jisamen algepi ke ali kaisar ko 20
 83 per cent, 15 to Krishna Kumari Yadav of RJD
 78 fisadi vot mili the

 to ab is chintaa ko aap ham par chhod den, kyonki ham bataa rahe hai ki aap kaise chun sakate hai apana sahi asana
 
 
 To adopt yoga, do not adopt any asana in the beginning, which is very difficult
 agar aap abhyaas kiye bagaiyr yoga shuru kar rahe hai, to kathin asana kii jagah koi aasaan sa asana chune
 Think which yoga is best for you
 yoga main har vyakti ke liye koi na koi asana he
 Choose the same posture in the beginning keeping in mind your flexibility, stamina and balance
 chintaa khatm hona, dimag ko shant karnaa or sharir ko aaraam dena jaise phaayde yoga ke baad hi dikhte hai
 Depending on your health and purpose, select the posture
 kamajoriyon or takat ke bare main export ko bataate hue sahi asana kii jaankaree len
 Do any yoga in the beginning slowly, because you are not an expert, do it properly at once
 yoga ke liye lacheelee body kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Initially, after yoga, the body will have some pain, but by practicing it the pain will end and the body will come into the routine
 saans lene or saans chhodane kaa sahi tarika aana bahut jarurati he
 You cannot practice asana until you breathe through your mouth
 isliye yogasana ke dauraan naak se hi saans lenaa or chhodana jaruri he
 To begin with, appropriation can also be made, which is good for everyone and also meets all needs
 koshish karen ki shuruyaat main halke or kam asana karen or is dauraan jo bhi asana aapako sabase saral or suvidhajanak lage, use apana len
 If you are thinking of adopting a group of asanas, do so only after consulting a yoga instructor

 Aam Aadmi Party MP Bhagwant Mann has called his recording of the controversy-ridden parliament an 'educational video'
 is video main, camentator ke taur par maan sansad main pravesh se pehle vibhinn suraksha jaanch (sicurity checks) kii jaankaree de rahe hai
 Significantly, the Parliament was targeted by terrorists in the year 2001
 is 'kaary' ko lekar maan ko tab tak sansad nahi aane ko kaha gaya he jab tak ki 9 sadasyon kii saansadon kii samiti unke kaam kii jaanch or dand kii sifarish nahin kar detii
 The committee consists of one member of each major opposition party and its chief is Kirit Somaiya of the ruling BJP
 samiti ne saansad maan kii ore se fasebuk par post kii gai 12 minute kii film dekhi he
 Mann has said in his defense that he wants his parliamentary constituency of Punjab to get information about how the Parliament operates
 ve shuukravaar ko is samiti ke saamne pesh honge
 Although he has regretted this video in his letter to parliamentary officials, but the AAP MP has also said that if he is guilty of compromising on security rules, then Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also guilty of this, which the Pakistani intelligence agency Allowed Pakistani officers, including ISI, to visit the Pathankot Air Force Base
 gauratlab he ki is varsh ke prarambh main pakistani aatankiyon ne is airforce base ko nishaanaa banaaya tha
 According to the information, most of the members of the inquiry committee are in favor of punishing Mana, but the ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal has instructed its representative to take a soft stand on Mann's case
 sutron ne NDTV ko bataaya ki trinmul supremeo mamata banerjee ne apni party kii dow
 Asked Ratna Dey to express the view that Mann's intent was not 'suspicious' but 'immature'
 party ke anusaar, maan is maamle main loksabhaa spikar sumitra mahajan se likhit main maafee maang chuke hai
 In such a situation, action should not be taken in the spirit of political vendetta

 bataaya jaataa he ki sansad kii suraksha team ne maan ke video ko suraksha prakriya ko aghat pahunchane vaala qaraar diya he
