 rajasthan ke do loksabhaa or ek vidhansabha seat par ho rahe upachunaav ne siyaasi taapmaana garm kar diya he
 The by-elections are held on January 29 in Ajmer and Alwar Lok Sabha seats as well as Manalgarh assembly seat
 bijepi netaa saanvarlaal jat ke nidhan ke chalate ajmer loksabhaa seat par upachunaav ho rahe hai
 The by-election is being seen as a semi-final before the state assembly elections
 aise main haar jeet ke nattejey donon dalon ke liye siyaasi nazariye se kaaphi ahm maane ja rahe hai
 The credit of both BJP and Congress parties is at stake in Amjer seat
 ajmer loksabhaa seat par bijepi or congress puri takat ke saath utar rahi hai
 In the political battle of Ajmer, Congress has nominated former MLA Raghu Sharma as candidate, while BJP has given ticket to Ramswaroop Lamba
 lamba, purv kendriya mantri saanvarlaal jat ke bete hai
 Please tell that in the 2014 Lok Sabha, Sanwarlal came to Parliament by winning on BJP ticket from Ajmer
 unke aakasmik nidhan ke baad ab party ne upachunaav main unke hi bete ko maidan main utaara he
 Political equation The political history of Ajmer Lok Sabha seat is quite interesting
 aazaadee ke baad hue pehle chunaav ke samay ajmer uttar or dakshin do seat thi, iske baad 1957 main hue chunaav main ek seat kar di gai
 So far, the Congress has won 10 times in the Lok Sabha elections held in Ajmer seat
 vahiin ek baar janata party or 6 baar bijepi ne darj kii he
 There were around 17 lakh voters at the time of 2014 Lok Sabha elections, which has increased to about 18 lakhs in the by-elections
 2014 main 11 lakh 56 hajaar 314 vot pade the, jisamen payalat ko 1 lakh 72 vot se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Ethnic Mathematics of Ajmer Look at the caste arithmetic of Ajmer Lok Sabha seat is considered to be Dalit and tribal dominated seat, but Jat and Gurjar have political dominance
 ajmer loksabhaa seat par essi or asti milakar 3
 There are 85 lakh voters, 2
 10 lakh jat hai, 2 lakh gujars, 1
 50 Lakh Rawat, 2
 60 lakh muslim, 1 lakh rajput, ek lakh brahman, 1
 There are 45 lakh Vaishyas and others
 bijepi jahaan jat, vaisya, ravat maton ke sahare hai, to vahiin congress brahman, muslim, guzar or dalit-adivasee maton kaa bharosa he
 BJP is at stake in Ajmer Lok Sabha by-election siem vasudhanra raaje ajmer seat jeetne ke liye harsambhav koshish main juty he
 The BJP understands well that if the party loses in Ajmer, its difficulties will increase even more in the coming assembly elections
 bijepi ajemar seat se kisi tarah ko aisa sandesh nahin dena chaahati he ki rajya main bijepi kii sthiti kisi bhi surat main kamjor he
 In view of this, the BJP has fielded Ramswarup Lamba, son of Sanwarlal Jat, so that the party can get its advantage
 bijepi is seat se jitkar rajya kii hawa ko bhagavamay karnaa chaahati he
 This is how Vasundhara Raje wants to win this seat and leave no other option
 ajmer congress ke liye semifinalrajasthan main satta kii vaapasi kii raah dekh rahi congress ke liye ajmer upachunaav semifinal ke taur par he
 Not only this, the credibility of Congress state president Sachin Pilot is also at stake, because he himself has been an MP from this seat
 aise main 2014 kaa hisaab bhi baraabar karne kii chunauti he
 Pilate himself has not descended and placed a bet on Raghu Sharma, a Brahmin face
 unki puri koshish he ki is ajmer upachunaav par jeet darj karne kii
 Congress won this seat and could create an atmosphere against BJP for the upcoming assembly elections

 The party general secretary Sitaram Yechury has the support of the Bengal unit

 The Politburo vetoed Yechury's line and at the recent meeting of the Central Committee in Delhi, more votes were cast against it (31-30 out of the 63 members who spoke, two chose the middle ground)

 The NDA government is in the dock once again regarding the laws related to the forest
 paryaavaran mantralay ne ek circular jari kiya he, jiske mutabik jangal ke bheetar aise kaaryon ke liye zamin lete vakt centre sarkaar kii anumati lene kii zarurat nahin he, jahaan ped na kaate ja rahe hon yaa khanan na ho rahaa ho
 The Central Government issued this order on October 7, in which it has empowered the State Governments to authorize a bureaucrat to grant land to a company, institution or firm for non-work (which is temporary)
 ye adhikari diefo level kaa ho saktaa he
 Experts say that with this order, the Central Government is in direct violation of the Forest Protection Act made in 1980
 koyala ghotaale main supreme court main yachikakarta rahe sudeep shrivastav kehete hai, ''is aadesh ke lagu hone kaa matlab he ki khanan se pehle kisi khanij kii khoj yaa survey ke liye companiyaan centre sarkaar kii anumati ke bagaiyr jangal main ghus sakati hai
 No tree is cut at the time of survey, that is, DFO level officer can allow it

 Sources in the central government say that this permission is only for temporary work where neither trees will be cut nor mining will be done
 lekin kanoon ke jaankaar kah rahe hai ki agar centre aisa badlaav karnaa chahta he to use sansad ke zarie 1980 ke van sangrakshan kanoon main sanshodhan karana chahie
 This change is also raising fears that the rights given to the lower bureaucracy will promote corruption
 mining companiyaan abhi jangal ke bade hisse main centre sarkaar se hi ijazat leti hai
 With the introduction of the latest rule, companies in the surrounding forests (where mining is not taking place) will get permission and many activities can be carried out illegally

 com / arnxsfjzsz The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has told the Delhi High Court in an affidavit that the appointment of the existing CVO in AIIMS, the largest government hospital in the country, was done without prior consent (prior approval)
 ames main bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii jaanch ke bare main sivisi kii ore se diye gayi halafname ke para 11
 3 states that on 14 August 2014, the joint secretary and CVO of the ministry was initially given the charge of CVO of AIIMS for three months for which no prior consent of the CVC was taken
 gauratlab he ki ames ke purv sivio sanjeev chaturvedi ko hataane ke liye endie sarkaar kii ore se yahi daleel di gai thi ki chaturvedi kii niyukti ke liye sivisi kii purv sahmati nahin lee gai lekin ab sivisi ke halafname se saaf ho gaya he ki maujuuda sivio manoj jhalani ko bhi sarkaar ne sivisi kii purv sahmati ke bina niyukti kiya
 Although later the Central Government took the consent of the CVC in the name of Jhalani, but the rules were also observed in that
 ames ke sivio ke pad par niyukt kiye gayi manoj jhalani swasthya mantralay ke bhi sivio hai
 The method adopted by the government to appoint him to the post of CVO of AIIMS is also under question
 visilence menual kaa para 2
 6
 1 kahata he kisi bhi swytt (autonomas) santhaan main sivio niyukt karne ke liye santhaan kii ore se hi uske (santhaan ke) teen adhikariyon kaa panel bheja jayega
 The CVO will be appointed by the officer in whose name the CVC consents, but this approach was not adopted in the case of Manoj Jhalani
 mantralay ne ames ke adhikariyon kii jagah apane hi swasthya mantralay ke teen adhikariyon kaa panel bheja
 These three officers are Mr
 Manoj Jhalani, Mr
 Rakesh Kumar and Ms
 Dhritri Panda
 ye teenon swasthya mantralay main hi joint secretary ke pad par hai
 The question arises as to how the government sent the names of the Health Ministry officials to the CVC instead of the AIIMS officers, while JP Nadda, who complained against Sanjeev Chaturvedi, has been repeating the same rules in the CVC manual
 centre main pichley saal nai modi sarkaar banane ke baad sanjeev chaturvedi ko ames ke sivio pad se hataa diya gaya jisase kaaphi vivaad khadaa hua tha
 The comments enditivi india ne aapako khabar dikhaai thi ki us vakt bataur saansad je pi nadda ne na keval sanjeev chaturvedi ko hataane ke liye swasthya mantri harshavardhan ko chitthiyaan likhi balki ye bhi kaha ki ames main bhrashtachar ke un maamalon kii jaanch roki jaae jo chaturvedi ne ujagar kiye hai
 Nadda had then suggested to the Central Government the name of the new CVO of his choice in AIIMS
 ab sivisi ke halafname se yah sawaal bhi khadaa hota he ki je pi nadda ne ames ke adhikari kii jagah mantralay ke adhikari ko sivio kyon banaaya jo unke maatahat kaam karata he
 Para 11 of affidavit given by CVC regarding investigation of corruption cases in AIIMS
 3 main kaha gaya he ki 14 agast 2014 ko mantralay ke joint secretary or sivio ko ames ke sivio kaa padbhaar shuru main teen maheene ke liye diya gaya jiske liye sivisi kii purv sahmati nahin lee gai
 It is worth noting that the same argument was made by the NDA government to remove former AIIMS CVO Sanjeev Chaturvedi that prior approval of the CVC was not taken for the appointment of Chaturvedi but now it is clear from the cvc's affidavit that the current CVO Manoj Jhalani was also appointed by the government without prior consent of the CVC
 haalanki baad main centre sarkaar ne jhalani ke naam par sivisi kii sahmati lee lekin usamen bhi niyamon kii anedkhi kii gai
 Manoj Jhalani, appointed to the post of CVO of AIIMS, is also the CVO of the Ministry of Health
 unhen ames ke sivio ke pad par niyukt karne ke liye sarkaar ne jo tarika apanaaya vah bhi sawaalon ke ghere main he
 Para 2 of Vigilance Manual
 6
 1 says that in order to appoint a CVO in any autonomous institution, a panel of three officers will be sent on behalf of the institute itself
 jis adhikari ke naam par sivisi sahmati degaa vahi sivio niyukt hoga, lekin manoj jhalani ke maamle main yah tarika nahin apanaaya gaya
 The ministry sent a panel of three officials of its own Ministry of Health in place of AIIMS officials
 ye teen adhikari he, shri manoj jhalani, shri rakesh kumaar or sushri dharitri pandas
 All three are in the Ministry of Health as Joint Secretary
 sawaal uthta he ki sarkaar ne kaise ames ke adhikariyon kii jagah swasthya mantralay ke adhikariyon kaa naam sivisi ke paas bheje jabaki sanjeev chaturvedi ke khilaaf shikaayat karne vaale je pi nadda sivisi minial ke isi niyam kii duhai dete rahe hai
 After the formation of the new Modi government at the Center last year, Sanjeev Chaturvedi was removed from the CVO post of AIIMS, causing much controversy
 tippaniyan NDTV India showed you the news that JP Nadda, then MP, not only wrote letters to Health Minister Harsh Vardhan to remove Sanjeev Chaturvedi, but also said that the investigation of corruption cases in AIIMS should be stopped which Chaturvedi exposed Huh
 nadda ne tab apni chitthiyon main centre sarkaar ko ames main apni pasand ke nae sivio kaa naam bhi sujhaayaa tha
 Now the cvc's affidavit also raises the question as to why JP Nadda replaced the AIIMS officer as the CVO of the Ministry which works under him
 gauratlab he ki ames ke purv sivio sanjeev chaturvedi ko hataane ke liye endie sarkaar kii ore se yahi daleel di gai thi ki chaturvedi kii niyukti ke liye sivisi kii purv sahmati nahin lee gai lekin ab sivisi ke halafname se saaf ho gaya he ki maujuuda sivio manoj jhalani ko bhi sarkaar ne sivisi kii purv sahmati ke bina niyukti kiya
 Although later the Central Government took the consent of the CVC in the name of Jhalani, but the rules were also observed in that
 ames ke sivio ke pad par niyukt kiye gayi manoj jhalani swasthya mantralay ke bhi sivio hai
 The method adopted by the government to appoint him to the post of CVO of AIIMS is also under question

 1 kahata he kisi bhi swytt (autonomas) santhaan main sivio niyukt karne ke liye santhaan kii ore se hi uske (santhaan ke) teen adhikariyon kaa panel bheja jayega
 The CVO will be appointed by the officer in whose name the CVC consents, but this approach was not adopted in the case of Manoj Jhalani
 mantralay ne ames ke adhikariyon kii jagah apane hi swasthya mantralay ke teen adhikariyon kaa panel bheja
 These three officers are Mr
 Manoj Jhalani, Mr
 Rakesh Kumar and Ms
 Dhritri Panda
 ye teenon swasthya mantralay main hi joint secretary ke pad par hai
 The question arises as to how the government sent the names of the Health Ministry officials to the CVC instead of the AIIMS officers, while JP Nadda, who complained against Sanjeev Chaturvedi, has been repeating the same rules in the CVC manual
 centre main pichley saal nai modi sarkaar banane ke baad sanjeev chaturvedi ko ames ke sivio pad se hataa diya gaya jisase kaaphi vivaad khadaa hua tha
 The comments enditivi india ne aapako khabar dikhaai thi ki us vakt bataur saansad je pi nadda ne na keval sanjeev chaturvedi ko hataane ke liye swasthya mantri harshavardhan ko chitthiyaan likhi balki ye bhi kaha ki ames main bhrashtachar ke un maamalon kii jaanch roki jaae jo chaturvedi ne ujagar kiye hai
 Nadda had then suggested to the Central Government the name of the new CVO of his choice in AIIMS
 ab sivisi ke halafname se yah sawaal bhi khadaa hota he ki je pi nadda ne ames ke adhikari kii jagah mantralay ke adhikari ko sivio kyon banaaya jo unke maatahat kaam karata he
 Manoj Jhalani, appointed to the post of CVO of AIIMS, is also the CVO of the Ministry of Health
 unhen ames ke sivio ke pad par niyukt karne ke liye sarkaar ne jo tarika apanaaya vah bhi sawaalon ke ghere main he

 Telecom regulator TRAI has suggested phasing out of termination charges in the next three years in a phased manner
 is kadam se mobile kii kol daren or ghat sakati hai
 The termination fee is paid by one operator to another operator whose call ends on the network
 yah interconection istemaal shulk (aiusi) kaa hissaa he
 Any change in this will affect the mobile rates
 philhal termination shulk 20 paise prati minute he or yah mobile kii kol daron kaa hissaa he
 TRAI had given several methods for calculating IUC in the Supreme Court
 par saath hi niamak ne kaha tha ki ise 2014 tak puri tarah khatm kar diya janaa chahie
 The apex court has to take a final decision in this regard
 jiesem oparator termination shulk ko kam kiye jane ke kisi bhi prastaav ke khilaaf hai
 On the other hand, CDMA players and new operators are supporting any proposal to abolish this fee altogether
 vartmaan oparator is shulk main katautee nahin chaahate hai, kyonki isse unako rajasav kaa ghaataa hoga
 On the other hand, new players are in favor of reducing the termination fee, as traffic flows from their network are more than incoming calls
 tri kaa vichaar he ki termination shulk main pragatisheel tareeke se katautee kii jaani chahie or ant main ise shunya ke str par laayaa janaa chahie
 If the termination fee is cut, the new players will first reduce the call rates, which will put pressure on the old companies to reduce the call rates
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne isse pehle tri ko ek oparator se duusare oparator ke network par kol le jane ke liye interconection shulk kii nai daren tay karne ko kaha tha
 The apex court gave this direction on the plea of TRAI challenging the TDSAT order
 tidisat ne tri ke interconection istemaal shulk (niyaman) 2009 ko radd kar diya tha
 In the 2009 IUC Regulation, TRAI had fixed the mobile termination fee at 20 paise per minute for all local and national long distance calls

 The terrorist camps of jaish-e-mohammed located in Balakot Strike were destroyed by the bombing
 haalanki bhartiya vayusena is air strike kaa koi video nahin bana pai
 This is the reason the Air Force could not issue any video as evidence of the air strike
 air strike se aatankiyon ke marane ke aankadon ko lekar desh main siyaasi bahes bhi chhidi rahi
 In fact, during the attack there were some circumstances that the Indian Air Force could not get live video while targeting the target

 The Indian Air Force has confirmed that Israeli air-to-surface missiles were not launched when bombs were dropped as the target was targeted to terrorist camps
 iske jariye hi lakshya bhedane kii prakriya kaa live video feed hasil hona tha
 Sources told NDTV that the presence of light clouds prevented the launch of Crystal Mage missiles with Spice 2000 glide bombs at the time of the action
 bhartiya vayusena ko bhi ummid thi ki vah is missile ke jariye hamale kaa video feed hasil kar baad main saarvajanik kar karrwai kaa subut duniya ke saamne rakhegi, magar aisa nahin ho sakaa
 Let me tell you that on 26 February, the Mirage 2000 fighter jets of the Indian Air Force went across the Line of Control and carried out an air strike in Pakistan
 is dauraan kul paanch spice 200 glide bam giraae gaye the
 Although Israeli equipment could not produce an air strike video, the Indian Air Force was later forced to assess its success through high-resolution satellite images obtained from a friendly strategic partner
 yah baat digar he ki gopneeyata se judi sharton ke kaaran in tasveeron ko airforce ne philhal dikhaane kaa faisla nahin liya he
 However, it is not clear whether the non-classified photos will be publicized in the future

 According to Adrian Genbergen, managing director of this organization - there was no evidence of a bomb falling on a picture of buildings

 i can only hope it reminds you that all is not lost and that someone, somewhere understands what you're going through
 🤞🌞 Thank you @tomoarakawa for making this a chic transition from long to short!a post shared bysonali Bendre(@iamsonalibendre) onjul 10, 2018 at 12:20am pdtfrom the moment he was born 12 years, 11 months and 8 days ago, my amazing @rockbehl took ownership of my heart
 From then on, his happiness and wellbeing have been the center of anything @goldiebehl and i ever did
 And so, when the Big c reared its ugly head, our biggest dilemma was what and how we were going to tell him
 As much as we wanted to protect him, we knew it was important to tell him the full facts
 We’ve always been open and honest with him and this time it wasn’t going to be different
 He took the news so maturely


 and instantly became a source of strength and positivity for me
 In some situations now, he even reverses roles and takes on being the parent, reminding me of things i need to do! i believe that it’s imperative to keep kids involved in a situation like this
 They are a lot more resilient than we give them credit for
 It’s important to spend time with them and include them, rather than make them wait on the side-lines, not being told yet instinctively knowing everything
 In our effort to protect them from the pain and realities of life, we might end up doing the opposite
 I’m spending time with Ranveer right now, while he’s on summer vacation

 But today the situation is better than before due to the steps taken by Beijing

 odd-even was used as an emergency only because it disrupts people's lives
 jhenn ne apni prajentation ke jariye bataaya ki kaise pradooshan kam kiya ja saktaa he-* construction cites ko dhank kar or sprincolor kaa istemaal karke pehle dhul uthne se roki gai* uske baad das lakh se zyada puraani gaadiyaan sadak par utarane se roki gayi* public transport durust ho, iske liye nayi basen launch kii gayi* 1200 se zyada pradooshan failaane vaali industry ko shahar se baahar kar, unamem istemaal hone vaali technolji ko bhi impruve kiya gaya* koyale kaa istemaal kam karne ke liye chini sarkaar ne sabsidi bhi diapako bataa den ki, dilli main kareeb 90 lakh vaahan hai, jinamein har teesraa vaahan car he

5 million cars, but Beijing claims that the public transport system in China's capital is better than Delhi

 There are 25000 thousand public buses here, while there are only 4500 buses in Delhi

 *** Muslim organizations angry in Alwar, will go for justice Courtalwar police took permission to shave
 Back in Rajasthan, there was a peculiar decree not to shave Muslim policemen
 alvar police ne nau pulisavaalon ke naam se dadhi rakhane ko lekar mili ijaajat ko waapas lene kaa aadesh diya tha
 After this order, there was resentment among Muslim organizations
 jiske baad alvar jile kii police ne us aadesh ko waapas le liya
 In which nine policemen were forbidden to shave
 aadesh main nau pulicekarmiyon ko dadhi kaatane ke liye kaha gaya tha taaki ve duty par rahete hue 'nishpaksh' dikhaai den
 What did the new order say? This is the order of the Alwar police
 jisamen naupulicekarmiyon kaa namalikha gaya tha ki inhen dadhi rakhane kii mili ijaajat waapas lee jaati he
 The order said that permission to shave these policemen is revoked with immediate effect
 isaki soochna police ke sabhi thane ke bade adhikariyon ko bhej di gai he
 In fact, it is a tradition in Rajasthan that the District Police Superintendent has to apply for bearding of minority policemen
 uske baad ye dadhi rakhte hai
 Alwar SP Paris Deshmukh said, 'we took these orders to maintain law and order
 hamane 32 pulisavaalon ko dadhi rakhane kii ijaajat de rakhi he jisamen se 9 ko di gai ijaajat waapas lee gai
 'resentment among Muslim policemen After this order, there was uneasiness among Muslim policemen
 muslim sanghathan ke longon kaa kahana he ki sarkaar aadesh waapas len varanaa ham court kaa darwaja khatkhataayenge
 They say that the Supreme Court had allowed minority policemen to shave in 1999
 rajasthan main grih mantralay kaa jimmaa khud mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ke paas he
 Therefore, ministers say that only big leaders will answer in this matter
 dadhi rakhane se kanoon vyavastha kaise bigadegi ise lekar police kuch nahin kah rahi he
 According to sources, this has been done to prevent incidents of people forming an opinion about policemen in the name of religion
 saath hin pichley kuch dinon se dadhi rakhanevaale muslim pulicekarmiyon kii sankhya bad rahi thi ise bhi rokane ke liye aisa kiya gaya he
 # Rajasthan: Police in Alwar district has taken back the order which disallowed nine policemen from keeping beards
 Order had asked the nine policemen to shave beards so that they appeared 'impartial' while on duty
 - ANI (@ANI) November 22, 2019 After this decree, Muslim policemen's resentment was revealed
 jisko dekhte hue alvar jile kii police ne us aadesh ko waapas le liya jisamen nau pulicekarmiyon ko dadhi rakhane se manaa kiya gaya tha
 For the first time in 22 years, the Congress set such political equations in Gujarat, that no weapon of the BJP was working
 rahul gandhi ne gujarat kii yuva trimurti ke jariye bijepi ke khilaaf gheraabandi karne ke liye jatigat formula banaaya tha, jo rajya main congress ke satta kaa vanvaas khatm karne kii ummid jagaa rahaa tha
 Amidst all this, Manishankar Iyer's slippery tongue has given life to the BJP
 ayyar ke bayaan se gujarat main congress ke jeet kaa jaayaka bigadataa hua najar aa rahaa he
 Mani Shankar Aiyar used the word 'lowly' for Narendra Modi on Thursday
 iske baad bijepi ne ayyar ke bayaan ko lekar congress ko kathghare main khadaa karnaa shuru kar diya
 However, the Congress suspended Iyer within a few hours, but the political atmosphere which was to be formed by the BJP gave him air
 piem narendra modi ne surat kii chunavi raily main kaha, 'ayyar kehete hai ki modi neech jati kaa he
 It is an insult to Gujarat
 mughal sanskaar waalon ko mere jaise achche kapade pahananaa sahan nahin hota he
 You called us a donkey and a dirty drain worm
 18 taarikh ko matpetiyaan bataaegi ki gujarat ke bete ke apmaan kaa badla kaise liya jaataa he
 However, the Congress has suspended Mani Shankar Aiyar from the primary membership of the party for making objectionable remarks on Modi
 saath hi maamle main kaaran bataao notice jari kiya gaya he
 Iyer's statement has not only hurt Narendra Modi and BJP, but also sweated the foreheads of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi
 rahul gandhi ayyar ke bayaan ke siyaasi myne bakhubismajhate hai
 That is why he has condemned the statement by tweeting and also asked to apologize to Modi
 rahul gandhi is baat se waakif hai ki unhone pichley chaar maheenon se jis kadar gujarat kii jameen par utarkar kaam kiya he
 In the state, ventilation was started in the Congress
 rahul navasrujan yatra ke jariye gujarat main siyaasi fasal ugane kii koshish kar rahe the
 This time Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi had laid the caste politics in the battlefield of Gujarat
 congress ne gujarat ke yuva trimurti hardik, alpesh or jignesh ko apane saath milakar jeet kaa khwab sanjoya tha
 The resentment of the Patels in Gujarat was a cause of worry for the BJP
 congress obisi sahit adivasee or dalit maton main sendhamari lagane main juty thi, jisase bijepi pareshaan thi
 Despite the bjp's millions of efforts, the air of Hindutva could not be created
 rahul gandhi shuru se hi soft hindutv kii raah par chal rahe the
 That is why even this card of BJP could not touch the road of success
 piem modi ke gujarat asmita card chal rahe the or apane aapako gujarat kaa betaa bataa rahe the
 Despite this, more than his rallies, crowds were gathering in Hardik Patel's rally
 bijepi isaki kaat nahin talash paa rahi thi
 In such a situation, Mani Shankar Iyer's statement has given Brahmastra to the BJP
 maujuuda daur main narendra modi par vyaktigat taur par hamalaa karne kaa nateeja congress ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab ban saktaa he
 Because whenever personal attacks have taken place on Modi, he has become even stronger
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle isi manishankar ayyar ne modi ke liye ‘chywala’ shabd kaa prayog kiya tha
 BJP made this an issue and what has happened to the Congress is well known
 aise main ab gujarat ke siyaasi ran main ek baar phir ayyar kaa part tu aayaa he
 What will be the result? ye to 18 taarikh ko hi pataa chalegaa

 uttar pradesh main sapa-basapa gathbandhan se darkinar kiye jane ke baad congress ab apni siyaasi ladaai khud ke sahare ladane ko taiyaar he
 The party has started strengthening its political ground
 isi kadi main congress mahasichav congress mahasachiv or purvanchal kii prabharee priyanka gandhi wadra ne buudhvaar ko meerut jaakar pashchim uttar pradesh main dalit yuvaaon ke bich teji se ubharate bhim army ke sansthaapak chandrashekhar aaazaad se mulaakaat kii
 Not only this, the way the Congress has so far fielded candidates on bsp-strong seats
 usase saaf he ki mayawati banaam priyanka ke bich kii siyaasi jang kii jameen taiyaar ho chuki he
 The congress-bsp is eyeing the same votebank Popularka Gandhi uniting the traditional votebank of the Congress
 inamen unki najar dalit, brahman or muslim matadaataaon par he
 Around 22 percent of the Dalit, 20 Muslims and 10 percent of the Brahmin community are voters in the state
 assi ke dashak tak congress ke saath dalit matadaata majbootee ke saath judaa rahaa, lekin basapa ke udai ke saath hi ye vot usase chhitakta hi gaya
 a similar Muslim voter also moved away from the Congress after 1992 and joined the SP and the Brahmin went with the BJP
 iskaa nateeja rahaa ki congress pehle number se chauthe number kii party banakar rah gai
 Interestingly, the BSP has also joined hands with Akhilesh Yadav to defeat the BJP in UP with the help of these three classes of votes
 basapa ke khate main 38 siten ai hai, inamen se 33 siton par ummidavaare naam tay kar die gaye hai
 The BSP has fielded candidates from 6 Muslims, 7 Brahmins, 1 Kshatriya, 1 Jat, 2 Gurjars, 1 Bhumihar, 9 Dalits, 3 Vaishyas and 4 other backward classes
 haalanki shravasti, jonpur, aanwala or machhlishahar (su) kii siton par abhi naam tay nahin hue hai
 According to sources, Mayawati has not become Akhilesh but the obstacle in Congress's way in Uttar Pradesh alliance
 yahi vajah he ki congress ab iskaa karaara jawaab dene kii ranneeti ke tahat kadam uthaa rahi he
 In this episode, Priyanka has met Chandrashekhar, a Dalit young face
 chandrashekhar se priyanka ke mulaakaat ke pich siyaasi mynapriyanka ne chandrashekhar se mulaakaat karke daliton ko bada sandesh dene kii koshish kii he
 Now, even though Priyanka is saying that this meeting should not be viewed through political spectacles, but the political implications of Priyanka's meeting with Chandrasekhar are hidden
 pashchim upi main dalit samudaay ke yuvaaon ke bich chandrashekhar kaa acha khaasaa graph he
 The Congress wants to use Chandrashekhar in UP just like Jignesh Mevani of Gujarat
 congress ne saaf kar diya he ki vah upi main badi majbootee ke saath chunaav ladegi
 The Congress has so far announced its 23 candidates in UP
 pehali list main 11 or buudhvaar ko jari hui duusari list main 16 ummidavaar ke naam the
 If we look at the Congress list, it is clear that after the alliance with SP-BSP, Mayawati is considering the seats as strong
 vahiin, par congress ne bhi majboot pratyaashee par daanv lagaaya he
 Congress especially against bsp's Muslim and Brahmin candidates
 basapa ke khilaaf congress ke majboot ummidavaarpaschim upi ke saharanpur seat basapa kii kaaphi majboot maani ja rahi he
 When the BSP expressed confidence in Haji Fazlur Rahman here, the Congress has fielded Imran Masood of a staunch image
 aise main hi sitapur loksabhaa seat se basapa ne nakul doobe ko utaara to congress ne purv saansad kaisar jahaan par daanv lagaaya he
 The BSP has fielded Ilyas Azmi's son Arshad Azmi as the candidate for the Dhaurahra seat while the Congress has fielded former MP Jitin Prasad
 fatehpur se basapa ne sukhdev prasad verma ko utaara to congress ne purv saansad rakesh sachaan par daanv lagaaya
 Congress nominated former MP Sanjay Singh against Chandrabhadra Singh of BSP from Sultanpur
 akbarpur se basapa kii nisha sachaan hai to congress ne raja rampal ko utaara he
 Congress has fielded Parvez Khan against Kushal Tiwari of BSP from Santkbir Nagar
 mohanlalganj se basapa ke si el verma ke saamne congress ne purv saansad ramshankar bhargav
 Congress has fielded former MP Ratna Singh from Pratapgarh against bsp's Ashok Tripathi
 bansgaanv se basapa ne doodhram ko maidan main utaara he, jabaki congress purv ipies afasar kush saurabh paswan par daanv khel rahi he
 The mood of Priyanka Gandhi is beyond reality, if sources are to be believed, the Congress has completely decided that it is not in the mood to give any walkover to the BSP in any condition, but by crossing a strong candidate in front of it
 Ready for battle
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki mayawati sapa ke saath milakar chunaav to lard rahi hai, lekin unki koshish he ki soobe kii sabase zyada siten unki hi party jite
 But the way the Congress has woven a trap, the bsp's dream may also be broken and the party may be reduced to number three and four
 agar aise hota he to chunaav ke baad piem pad ko lekar mayawati kii daavedaari khatm ho jaaegi
 It is clear that in the political battle of the state, Mayawati is directly facing Priyanka Gandhi

 duniya main kai desh aise hai jahaan mahilaayein ab bhi badtar halaat main rah rahi hai
 One of these countries is Saudi Arabia
 yahaan mahilaon ko kai basic adhikaar tak hasil nahin hai
 The issue arose on social media when the Girls Council was formed for women's rights
 par council kii pehali pehali meeting main hi mahilaon ko saath nahin baithaaya gaya
 9 strange restrictions, which apply to Saudi women, where you can assess the condition of women, they are banned from leaving home alone
 jaaniye vahaan ke aise niyam, jinaki aap kalpana tak nahin kar sakate
 1
 bina do purush gavaahon ke koi bhi mahila property nahin kharid sakati
 The funny thing is that without a male witness the identity of the women is not confirmed
 yahi nahin, jo do purush mahila kii pushti karne aate hai unki vishwasaneeyata kii pushti karne ke liye bhi chaar or purush gavaahon kii jarurat hoti he
 2
 yahaan mahilaayein, sports main hissaa nahin letin
 If someone does this, then people get angry
 aapako jaanakar hairaani hogi ki 2012 ke olympic games main pehali baar saudi arab kii mahila khilaadiyon ne hissaa liya tha
 But after this there was a lot of opposition in the country
 puri duniya ne dekha tha ki us samay femail athleates olympic main puure sharir ko kapadon se dhake hue or hijaab main daudti najar ai thim
 Such is LIFE3 of women in Saudi Arabia
 kai baar yah kaha jaataa he ki saudi arab main rape karne waalon ke khilaaf sakht kanoon he
 But the truth is that there are a large number of rapes here
 shaayad aapako ye pataa nahin hoga ki yahaan patni ke saath jabaran sambandh banane ko rape nahin mana jaataa
 In the incidents of second rape, no accused can be punished unless there are four witnesses of rape
 isliye vahaan rape sabit karnaa ek mushkil kaam he
 Some cases have also been seen that if a woman is raped and at that time she has left home alone or there is no male guardian with her, then she is also punished
 4
 Women cannot travel alone there
 unke saath kisi purush gargian kaa hona aavashyak he
 Not only this, women need the consent of men to travel
 haalat ye hai ki agar kisi mahila kaa pati jivit nahin he to use apane bete se likhit anumati leni hoti he
 5
 saudi main har mahila kaa koi naa koi purush gargian hona aavashyak he
 Whether he is his father, or uncle, brother, son
 6
 Despite all this, there women are ahead of men in terms of education
 lekin naukari main inaki sankhya bahut kam he
 7
 saudi arab main mahilaon kii driving ko lekar koi niyam nahin he lekin vahaan ise acha nahin mana jaataa
 After several protests, women now have the right to drive only children to leave school and to drive a family member to the hospital

 According to a reference book published by a state board on the political history of Gujarat, the fire in a coach of the Sabarmati train in February 2002 was part of a "conspiracy" hatched by a Congress member elected from Godhra
 is agnikand main 59 karsevakon kii jaan chali gai thi jiske baad rajya main bade paimaane par dange hue the
 The opposition Congress, however, called it the BJP government's attempt to saffronize the University Granth Nirman Board (UGNB)

 The Congress said it would seek legal opinion against the author for "sabotaging" the court's decision in the Godhra train fire

 While the book shows a rosy picture of BJP governments, the Congress has been deliberately portraying a bad image while distorting the facts
 ”unhone kaha, “ham godhra maamle main adaalat ke faisle ko tod-marodakar pesh karne ko lekar vidhik raay lenge or kitaab waapas lene ke liye pradarshan karenge
 When asked about this, the book's co-author Bhavnaben Dave said, "the order passed by the court is for everyone to see and i have nothing to say about it

 If Congress sees its failures (which are mentioned in the book) and feels bad about them, then it is its problem

 Tejashwi Yadav, rjd's youth leader and son of Lalu Prasad Yadav, said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak that the biggest thing is that the people of Bihar are with us
 chaara ghotaalaa jo he kah sakate hai ki ye bhaichara main badal jaataa, agar lalu ji apane DNA se samjhauta kar lete
 If Lalu ji would join hands with BJP, then this same Lalu ji would have become king Harishchandra
 tejasvi yadavane kaha ki lalu ji ko fansaane main nitish kumaar kii badi bhoomika rahi he
 They knew that if Lalu ji would stay, Nitish Kumar would never become the Chief Minister of Bihar
 nitish kumaar ne bijepi ke saath milakar lalu ji ke khilaaf sajeesh kii he
 Tejashwi Yadav said that BJP and Nitish Kumar did the act of abusing Karpoori Thakur
 bihar kii janata ye sab dekh rahi he
 Tejashwi Yadav said that in this period of Indian politics, if he thinks that Lalu ji is jailed, then trouble is averted, then he is making a big mistake
 kyonki khatra abhi tala nahin he
 Rather, Kaal is going to take birth for them
 lalu yadav ke bete tejasvi yadav ne kaha kilalu ko sajaa hone parabihar kii janata khaasaa naaraaz he or wo iskaa virodh kar rahi he
 According to Tejashwi, the people of Bihar are in a rage, because the one whom the people chose, is in jail today and who has not done any work, is sitting in the government today
 ab jisane sajeesh kiya he, uske khilaaf ekajute hokar muqabla karnaa he
 We are not afraid of these people
 apni vichaardhaara se hamane kabhi samjhauta nahin kiya
 The people of Bihar will surely reply to Nitish Kumar
 unhone bijepi par waar karte hue kaha ki bijepi samvidhan ko nahin maanati
 She has always been anti-reservation
 bijepi ke raaj main desh main aghoshit rup se emergency he
 Those who speak against the government face false cases
 aise kai udhaaharan hai
 This government is dictator
 samvidhan or hamaara desh khatre main he
 It is our duty to protect the Constitution
 tejasvine kaha ki bijepi RSS ke agenda par kaam karti he or vah propaganda banane main maahir he
 Conspiracy to stop Rahul, Javed Yadav said that Rahul Gandhi was emerging fast in the 90s
 lekin bijepi ne unhen rokane kii sajeesh kii
 There is no justice in this government
 tejasvi ne kaha ki jab bijepi ko laga ki lalu yadav majbootee se ubhar rahe hai to unako bhi rokane kii sajeesh kii
 Disgraced the entire family, he said that not only Lalu Prasad is being defamed by accusing him, but the entire family is being maligned
 kahin bhi yah pramanit nahin ho paaya he ki lalu prasad yadav ke paas aay se zyada sampatti he
 It is a different matter to accuse, but we have already won
 2ji scam cese main jis tarah ambani ko bachaaya gaya, use desh ne dekha
 This is not a final decision, Tejashwine said, adding that it is not a final judgment ham log hoicourt jaaenge
 If justice is not found there, then go to the Supreme Court
 ek hi maamle main jagannatha mishra ko jahaan reeha kar diya gaya, vahiin lalu prasad yadav ko sajaa mili
 It is clear that this is being done intentionally
 tejasvi yadavane kaha ki wo daur yaad kiijie jab adwani ke rath ko lalu yadav ne roka tha
 Lalu had also done the job of fighting for reservation for Mandal
 humlog sachai jaanate hai or sachai turant saamne nahin aati he
 i am sure we will get justice from the court
