 Giving this arrangement, the Constitution Bench cautioned that the Right to Information Act cannot be used as a weapon of surveillance and the independence of the judiciary should be kept in mind while considering the issue of transparency

 Many will remember that Rahul Bhatt's name came under suspicion due to his inadvertently being associated with the accused David Headley
 rahul bhatta filmkaar mahesh bhatta ke bete hai
 He later based his experiences on the crime-fiction writer S
 hossain jaidi ke saath angreji main ek kitaab likhi thi
 The Hindi translation of which has been published from 'headley and Main' Harper Hindi
 iskaa anuwadprabhat ranjanane kiya he
 The role is written by Hahesh Bhattane
 padhie bete kii kitaab par bhatta sahab ke vichaar
 'you have a choice, son
 yaa to tum apni jindagi ek peedit kii tarah jeeyo, apane kharaab bachapan ko apni baanh par tamge kii tarah pahano, un logon se sahanubhuti pate raho jo tumhaare liye kuch nahin hai, yaa phir in sabase nikal jaao
 Use your pain and your anger creatively and move forward
 maine baad vaala kiya
 That's why i am where i am today
 kya tum jaanate ho, tumme or mujhamen ek baat saamaanya he
 a childhood in which there was no father
 
 
 ’main rahul se baat kar rahaa tha jab main spiti ke vishaal, bhavy maidaanon se guzar rahaa tha
 It was truly God's land
 shukraguzaar hum apni beti puja kaa, jo apane nirdesan main banane vaali pehali film kii shooting kar rahi thi, or ham kibbar main the, jo duniya kaa sabase ooncha gaanv he jahaan gaadi se ja paanaa sambhav he
 This was a very rare occasion for Rahul and me when we were together after many years
 vastav main, 1985 kii us dard bhari raat ke baad jab main uske ghar se baahar nikal gaya tha, jab vah mushkil se teen saal kaa tha
 Where then did i know that life would test him and he would be forced to choose that option
 ‘tum use mohammad kyon kahana chaahate ho, betaa?’meri maa ne poocha, jisane sara jivan apni muslim pahchaan ko chhipaane main lagaaya tha
 He feared that even in this so-called secular country, Muslims were seen as 'other'
 ‘kyonki main chahta hum ki aapaki musalmaan viraasat mere bete ke madhyam se kisi rup main chalati rahe’, maine jawaab diya
 My mother's point finally came to light when she coalesced with my anglo-indian wife and my very rational saintly Maharashtrian Brahmin neighbor, my son was named Rahul aka Sunny
 peeche mudakar dekhne par dar lagata he ki 2009 main mere bete ke saath kya hua hota agar uskaa naam mohammad bhatta rakhaa gaya hota
 Rahul was born in order to mend my relationship with my childhood sweetheart Lauren Bright (kiran Bhatt), which by then had been wired up
 or mujhe yaad he ki maine ek baar phir pitrutv ko puure dil or dimag se apanaaya tha
 Rare and early memories of being with Sunny and me emerged
 paali hill par bhor foot rahi he
 i am an unemployed, and struggling filmmaker
 main sanni ko sambhrant paali hill main pram par lekar ghumaa rahaa hum, use subah kii saiyr ke liye le ja rahaa hum
 a slightly famous actor who is well intoxicated, returning from a late night party, his heart melts when he unexpectedly sees me in a father avatar with his young child
 vah sanni ke upar jhukta he or uske chaaron taraf alcohol kii gandh aa rahi he, vah fusfusaata he, ‘kya tumko yah yaad rahegaa ki tumhaare pita tumko us samay subah kii saiyr par le ja rahe hai? yaa sabhi beton kii tarah tum bhi is baat ko bhul jaaoge?’yah kehete hue vah meraa chumban letaa he or apni car kii taraf bad jaataa he
 Don't know why, but that fun memory overwhelms me today
 smritiyaan
 
 
 Memories have been the stuff of my life
 insaan aakhirkaar smriti hi to he
 When i look inside myself, i find that i do not have memories with my son
 ek faltaa-phulataa karier, duusari shaadi, satya kii meri talash, in sabane ek tarah se mere jivan ko jakad liya, or mere paas apane bete ke saath bitaane ke liye samay kam se kam hota gaya (maine apni duusari shaadi se hui apni do betiyon ke saath bhi is dauraan shaayad hi koi samay bitaayaa)
 Although i managed for him in every way, and like a father who was present in every bad phase of his life, i think small things are ignored
 main roj-roj ke kaamon main usko samay nahin de paaya, vah saamaanya jivan jo pita or beta saath-saath bitaate hai
 That way when i was unsuccessful and unemployed
 kadava sach yah he ki main vah ho gaya jo main nahin bananaa chahta tha
 Throughout my life, i used to blame my father for these things
 or ab main vahi kar rahaa tha
 i wanted to be able to fix it
 lekin nahin jaanata tha ki kaise
 And one day fate gave me the opportunity i wanted
 asal main, aisa laga ki puri duniya ne aisa maahaul banaaya ki mujhe manamafik mauka milane kaa samay aa gaya
 'I think this David Headley that intelligence agencies are talking about is the same man i knew through my fitness trainer partner Vilas Varak
 or main pakkaa hum ki jis rahul ke bare main ve lagaataar sandarbh de rahe hai vah main hi hum’, mere bete ne mujhase phone par kaha
 It was another day, but the toughest days of my life opened up
 duniya ke liye yah manoranjan tha
 For me, it was nothing less than a holocaust
 ‘mujhe kya karnaa chahie?puja or mummy kah rahi thi ki mujhe aapse salaah karke police ke paas janaa chahie
 What should i do, father? ' He asked, trying to look normal, but i could feel the fear in his voice
 yah ajeeb tha
 Except for all the cities of the world, it seemed that David Headley chose this city
 or usase bhi badhkar, is shahar ke lakhon logon ko chhodkar mere bete ko dosti ke liye chunaa! main apane jivan kii sabase badi duvidha main tha
 In the world, where we keep talking about happiness and duty, parents are prepared in such a way that they can keep children away from danger
 kya ham apane bacchon ko iske liye taiyaar nahin karte hai ki ve apni suraksha kaa dhyaan rakhen, ajanabiyon se bachakar rahen, apane seat belt baandhakar rakhen, or sadak paar karte samay chaaron taraf dekh liya karen?lekin aap jo karte hai, vahi aap hote hai, vah nahin hote jo aap kehete hai ki aapako karnaa chahie
 Our whole family was under examination
 kya hamen chupchaap baithkar dekhte rahanaa tha, yaa janata kii najaron main aane kaa khatra uthaakar vah bhoomika nibhaani thi jo bhagya ne hamaare liye chunaa tha?pehali pratikriya to yah thi ki is tsunami ko dur bhagaanaa jo dhire-dhire hamaari taraf babbti aa rahi thi
 We had seen many such instances in which the sentiments of the public after 26 / 11 had caused investigative agencies to act inhumanly and unjustly against many innocent, and especially many Muslim boys
 saath hi, yah khyaal bhia rahaa tha ki dakshinpanthi takatein jinke saath maine anek katu ladaaiyaan ladi hai, is maukey kaa phayda uthaakar mujhe cheer daalenge or mere bete ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate the
 i had come to understand that this was not a television show about an unfortunate man that i would turn off my television set by pressing a button
 yah vaastavik jivan tha, or yah meraa ladkaa tha, or vah telephone kii duusari taraf tha, us jawaab ke intazaar main jo uske jivan ko badal saktaa tha
 i asked him a question, 'have you done anything that you are not telling me? Because if you have done then you will have to bear the fruits of your actions, son
 lekin agar nahin kiya he to tumko darane kii koi zarurat nahin he
 Raise your head and go to the police
 ’rakhane se pehle usne hanste hue kaha, ‘papa, maine kuch bhi galat nahin kiya he
 Trust me ’uske baad jo hua vah acha bhi tha or bura bhi
 Bad because the same culture that was pretending to pay tribute to those who sacrificed their lives in the 26 / 11 massacre, the same people turned back and questioned these two people
 rahul, vilaas, hamaara parivaar or main us raat ke baad samachar ke bhukhon ke liye khaadya padaarth ho chuke the
 Right-wing forces were deliberately working with news channels to create suspicion around my son and were engaged in making him dwarf
 jo baat main kabhi nahin samaj sakaa vah yah ki kis tarah se bajaay iske ki in do saahsee yuvakon kii tarif kii jaye ki unhone sutaraviheen jaanch agenciyon kii iske liye madad kii ki ve is cese ke bheetar jaakar is dabl agent kii cargujariyon kii jaanch kar saken, sabhi isi nattejey par pahunch gaye ki ve deshadroh ke doshi hai
 Actually, he was a hero
 vilaas ko to apni naukari se bhi haath dhonaa padaa or ajtak use waapas nahin mila he
 It would be fair to say that the NIA, Mumbai Police and Intelligence Branch officials treated these boys very respectfully and patted them on the back in private or not in public
 lekin mere tathakthith dost or rishtedaar achaanak kahin prishthbhumi main chhip gaye, unako dar tha ki shaayad kahin koi bhayanak aparaadh kaa pardaafash hone vaala tha
 I, who used to stand up for anyone, suddenly felt lonely
 main or meri bahadur beti puja ne sani ke ird-gird ek diwaar bana lee or roj-roj ke aadhaar par ladaai ladi, is baat kaa intjaar karte hue ki dhara hamaari taraf mud jaae
 But it was a very good time for us
 kyonki meraa betaa or main jivan main pehali baar itani najadik aaye
 He began to understand that the man who had gone away in the midnight of 1985 had not actually gone anywhere
 ajeeb vidmbana kii baat thi, maine jo saal dur rahakar bithaye, apane liye naam banane ke liye, usne use bachaane main meri madad kii
 Because if i hadn't been famous, there would have been no one who was respected for speaking the truth, i don't think my son would have been able to get out safely
 agar vah kisi gumnaam aadmi kaa betaa hota, to kya ve use usee tarah se dekh pate? jab main yah likh rahaa hum to meraa dil un anek nirdosh logon ke liye dhadak rahaa he jo itane bhaagyashaalee nahin rahe
 In some ancient tribes, when a son grows up, he kills a wild animal to show his father that he has grown up
 mere liye, apane aapako khol dene kii rahul kii tatparta, or jis sammaan or nidarta se usne un bhayanak dinon kaa saamana kiya jab uske upar kuch log deshadrohi hone ke aarope laga rahe the, or is puri kahani ko kholkar rakh dene kii uski ichha is baat ke sanket hai ki jis ladke ko main kai garmiyon pehle subah kii saiyr ke liye le jaataa tha vah ab bada ho chukaa tha
 And that man's journey has just begun

 The Modi government at the Center has played a new bet on politics and vote bank based on castes
 buudhvaar ko cabinet kii baithak main centre sarkaar ne yah faisla kiya ki kendra sarkaar kii naukariyon main OBC kii bheetar alag-alag jatiyon ko aarakshan dene ke liye ab har jati kaa kota tay kiya jayega
 That is, the reservation for the backward classes will now have a system of reservation within the reservation
 obisi cote ke bheetar kota banane ke liye centre sarkaar jald hi ek samiti kaa gathan karegi jo 12 hafton ke bheetar apni report degi
 The decision has been left to the commission on what method will be adopted to give reservation within reservation and whether it will be the basis of caste or economic status
 ek or faisle main cabinet ne aarakshan kaa laabh paane ke liye krimi layer kii aamadani kaa dayera 6 lakh se badhaakar 8 lakh salanaa kar diya he
 That is, the families whose annual income is up to 8 lakh rupees will not come within the creamy layer and they will continue to get the benefit of reservation
 cabinet ke faisle ke bare main bataate hue vitt mantri arun jetali ne bataaya ki yah kadam isliye uthaaya ja rahaa he taaki OBC ke aarakshan kaa phayda iske bheetar aane vaali sabhi jatiyon ko barabari se mil sake
 Union Minister Arun Jaitley said that the Backward Classes Commission had recommended in 2011 itself that reservation should be classified within the OBC quota
 uske baad sansad kii sthai samiti ne bhi aisi sifarish kii thi
 Jaitley claimed that after the implementation of this decision, there will be no bias in availing reservation and non-equalization will be eliminated
 kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ne bhi centre sarkaar ke is faisle kaa swaagat kiya or kaha ki unki lok janashakti party bahut pehle se hi isaki maang karti rahi he ki OBC ke bhitararakshan kaa vargeekarankia janaa chahie
 Paswan said that nine other states including Bihar had already been categorized on the basis of extremely backward
 mana jaataa he ki bihar main nitish kumaar kii safalataa kaa ek bada kaaran yah tha ki unhone nae tareeke kii soshal ejineering karke pichhadon or daliton ke bich main ati pichhadaa or ati dalit kaa bantwaaraa karkipane vot bank ko majboot kiya
 According to experts, the biggest blow from this decision will be to the people of Yadav caste in North India and especially in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, who till now were at the forefront of taking advantage of reservation due to their strong economic and social status
 yah baat bhi jagajaahir he ki bihar or uttarapradesh main yadav jati ke zyaadaatar voter BJP ke mukaable lalu yadav kii argedy or akhilesh yadav kii samaajawaadee party ke saath zyada majbootee se khadey hote hai
 With this decision, BJP will strengthen its hold among other castes except Yadav among OBC castes

 lekin, satta se lambey samay se baahar kisi netaa ko janmdin par tohfe main helicopter mili to isaki charchaa hona laazmi he
 Something similar is going to happen on April 29, the birthday of former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Ajit Jogi
 unhen tohfe main helicopter milegaa
 The helicopter is of course second-hand but it is only the helicopter
 ye helicopter abhi chhattisgarh ke aasmaan main udaan to nahin bhar rahaa lekin uske yahaan dastak dene kii khabar se hi raajnneetik galiyara garmaya hua he
 Leaders of the Jogi camp claim that they have bought this helicopter by loosening their pockets
 jogi ne congress se nishkasit hone ke baad chhattisgarh janata congress naam se apni party banaai
 His son Amit Jogi is an MLA in Chhattisgarh
 chhattisgarh main mukhya vipakshi dal congress ke netaaon kaa aarope he ki rajya kii bijepi sarkaar pichley daravaaje se is helicopter ko jogi tak pahunchane main madad kar rahi he
 However, Ajit Jogi and his MLA son have kept their silence for the present
 ajit jogi rajya kii raajnneeti main apni puraani dhamak paane ke liye ji-tod prayaas kar rahe hai
 It is being told that two supporters of Ajit Jogi bought a second-hand helicopter for him for Rs 7 crore
 ummid jataai ja rahi he ki dilli se yah helicopter 15 april ko raipur pahunch jayega
 According to sources, Jogi, a pro-jogi MLA and a transport businessman, will hand over the chopper to Jogi on his birthday
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki OSS company kaa ye helicopter dilli se kharida gaya he
 The owner of this company lives in Dubai

 It is being said that for the fourth time BJP is considering Jogi as a trump card to come to power
 jogi kii koshish yahi he ki prachaar-prasar ke maamle main congress ko peeche chhod den
 The BJP hopes that Jogi will only water the Congress' aspirations

 aakhirkaar yah ehsaas majboot hota ja rahaa he ki bharat ko apane shaharon ke liye kuch karnaa he
 Indigenous cities have borne the brunt of wrong priorities for decades
 vampanthi or samaajawaadee buddhijiviyon kii salaah or nehruwadi netaaon ke us par shiddat se amal karne kaa hi nateeja in shaharon ko bhugatna padaa he
 India should realize the most that big civilizations thrive, flourish and end with cities
 apane shaharon kaa suniyojit tareeke se galaa ghotane main hamen maharath hasil he
 The beginning begins with the bizarre notion that if India is to develop, then the development and prosperity of its rural area is necessary, not the cities
 gandhi ji ne bhale hi kaha ho ki bharat gaanvon main basataa he, lekin unhone shahari bharat se vikaas ke unmoolan kii raay to nishchit rup se nahin di hogi
 While urban and rural areas are two parts of the same country body, development of the other is not possible without the development of one
 shahar to ped kii jad kii tarah hote hai
 They can provide new inventions, capital, human labor, security, justice, freedom and other facilities necessary for human development more effectively
 aisa karne main ve isliye samarth hote hai kyonki chote rihaishi ilaakon, bastiyon kii tulana main yahaan adhik sankhya main vibhinn prishthmoomi vaale log rahete hai or unka paraspar sampark or seva kaa aadan-pradaan aasaani se hota rahata he
 Interestingly, cities do this work in a more effective way
 udhaaharan ke taur par gaanv main rahane vaala ek shaks kisi shahari kii tulana main adhik bade bhukhand par rahata he
 This is reflected by the greater population density in cities
 iske alaava agar shaharon kaa vikaas nahin hota he to log gaanvon kii upjau jameen kaa adhik istemaal karenge
 Villages are located near good water sources and in terms of agriculture, the land is very fertile
 pradooshan gaanvon main bhi hota he, lekin ham uski upeksha kar jate hai
 The use of fertilizers and pesticides, burning agricultural waste and the use of diesel water pumps also cause pollution
 duusare shabdon main shaharon or gaanvon kii ek-si samasyaayein hai, antar bas itnaa he ki shaharon main ve saaf najar aati hai
 Cities also live in the sense that many types of people come together to solve such problems
 pichhali sarkaar ne shaharon ke bare main kuch samajhane kii koshish nahin kii or andhadhundh nirmaan kii yojanaayen banaati rahi, yojanaon kaa kriyanvayan karti rahi
 Infrastructure i
e
 construction is important, telecom, or use of the latest technology in Internet communication, transport and construction is also necessary, but these alone cannot build a smart city
 sabase bada antar shaharon main uplabdh karwaai jane vaali sevaaon main he—jal-mel nikasi, kachra prabandhan, saarvajanik yatayaat, kanoon or vyavastha, yatayaat niyantran mahatvapurn kaarak hai lekin inamen sudhaar ke liye sarkaar ko ek badi baadha ko paar karnaa padegaa
 Infrastructure is easy to build, but it is very difficult to get quality services
 yaad kiijie ki immergency ke dinon main seva vyavastha kitni sudhar gai thi, kuch-kuch waisi jaisi aaj apanaai ja rahi he lekin uske phaayde sthaayee nahin rahe
 Today the level of services available in most cities is quite poor, it is because of the fact that the services are not accountable to the elected representatives of that area
 bade shaharon main satta kii kaman naukarshah, nagar nigam ayukta tak ho sakati he jo antatru mukhyamantri ke prati javabdeh hote hai, yahi vajah he ki sabhi rajyon main mukhyamantri ke awaas ke aasapaas sari jan-sevaayen behad durust or stareey hoti hai
 So the solution is that the cities are then handed over to the public
 shahar ke mahayor kaa chunaav us shahar kii janata dwaara kiya janaa chahie, jo sidhe janata ke prati hi javabdeh ho
 It is the democratic process that decides how taxation should be done, how revenue should be divided and how each city should be conceived
 nagar nigam ayukta mukhyamantri kii bajaae mahayor se nirdesh len
 But the mayors of about 8,000 cities of the country will have to be equipped with more rights and give bigger vision
 ‘smart city’ shabd ko ek aakaar dena hoga taaki log uske liye prayaas kar saken
 So what should be the motto of this? Prime Minister Narendra Modi understands the importance of public places
 sabarmati nadi kaa kinaaraa yaa varanasi ke ghat manoranjan yaa tafarih ke sthaan bhar nahin hai, ye logon ko saath laate hai
 The market is also a place where many types of people gather, but in Delhi, the government is scrapping weekly haats and unorganized markets in a planned manner, instead of opening big malls, where only rich people can go
 sampark kaa ek arth shahar main avaagaman ko aasaan karnaa bhi hota he
 Before independence, the British government built wide footpaths in big cities - Bombay, Calcutta and Madras, but after independence, our political masters do not remember that even pedestrians have to walk along the roads
 unnat shahar kaa ek anya kaarak jansankhya kii vividhta bhi hota he, landan or neuyork is baat ke udhaaharan hai ki vibhinn prishthbhumi ke logon ke swatahsfoort sampark se kis tarah aarthik or bauddhik samruddhi nirbaadh pravaahit hoti he
 Take the example of India
 jab gaiyr-bengaaliyon ne kolkata chhodia shuru kiya to yah shahar ladkadaa gaya, duusare rajyon se log mumbai aae to yah shahar unnat hone laga, vibhaajan ke baad sharnaarthiyon ke aane ke baad dilli kaa swaroop pehle bigadaa, phir sanwara
 When people started coming from other states in Bangalore, then its development vehicle also started moving
 lekin hamen abhi bahut kuch karnaa he
 Interaction and diversity will only work if Indian cities give enough space to the poor
 nahin, unhen avaidh jhuggi-jhunpadi main na rakhen, na hi behad oonchi bilandigon main; jaisaa ki kuch rajyon kaa prastaav he, balki aisi jagah rakhen, jahaan unke bachche aazaadee se khel saken, mahilaayein bekhauf hokar chal saken, aisa khulaa sthaan ho, jo maataaon or police kii najar main ho
 This can be the core of Modi's 'smart city'
 aisa shahar jo garibon kaa khuli baahon se swaagat karata he

 He said that Punjab mps, mlas and ministers are not being granted visas and permission to visit Nankana Saheb to attend this historic joint ceremony
 kya he puraa maamla?aayojan ke prabandhan kii samiksha ke dauraan anaupchaarik rup se mediakarmiyon se baat karte hue mukhyamantri ne kaha ki yah garv kaa avasar he, jise unki sarkaar raajnneeti se upar uthakar ek sanyukt samaroh ke rup main manaanaa chaah rahi thi
 But the Shiromani Akali Dal and especially Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal have done their utmost to thwart the efforts of the state government, which is purely petty
 is samaaroh ke liye punjab sarkaar kii ore se 550 karod rupee kharch karne kaa zikr karte hue amarinder ne kaha ki is puure avasar ko akali dal ne apni sahyogi bijepi ke saath milakar tamaashe main tabdeel kar diya he
 Capt Amarinder termed his ministers and representatives of Punjab as unfortunate to not allow him to visit Gurdwara Nankana Sahib in Pakistan
 unhone kaha ki isadharmik avasarpar raajnneeti ko pare rakhaa janaa chahie
 He also reiterated that he would continue to oppose Pakistan's decision not to withdraw the fee of $ 20 on pilgrims traveling through the corridor 
 centre sarkaar kaa daawa?unhone sikh samudaay kii bhaawanaaon or paramparaon ke maddenjar pakistan sarkaar se dil bada rakhane kii apil kii
 Asked if the Punjab government was willing to pay this amount of fees on behalf of the pilgrims, Amarinder said that they were in principle against giving anything to Pakistan
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main captain ne kaha ki centre sarkaar kaa yah daawa bakawaas he ki 550vemprakash parvase judi pariyojnaon ke kharch kaa bada hissaa centre kii ore se diya ja rahaa he
 The Center has only given money for the projects and in one of these the Center has made partial contribution
 unhone kaha ki rajya sarkaar isamen pehle hi 550 karod kharch kar chuki he or vibhinn kaaryakramon or infrastracchar deveopment par kharch karti rahegi
 Denying Harsimrat's allegations of doing politics on this issue, the Chief Minister said that it is a matter of pride for the Sikh community and Punjab that when the first batch of devotees pass through the Kartarpur Corridor, the Vice President of India will also visit Kartarpur Sahib on 9 November Huh
 kartarpur coridor 9 november, 2019 ko bharat pakistan ke bich antarrashtriya seemaa par shraddhaluon ke liye khol diya jayega

 lekin sawaal to yah uthta he ki kya vivek tiwari kii chalati gaadi main goli maarna police ke 'bartaav' kii samasya he
 Or is it the result of the atmosphere that has arisen due to the rampant encounter in the state? There are often allegations about the nexus between police and politicians
 kya is course ke jariye police karmchaariyon ko yah bataaya ja sakegaa ki police kii praathmikat main lau and order ko thik rakhana he na ki netaaon ke aadesh ko maananaa?khayr, is tarah kii training pehali baar nahin ho rahi he
 In 2017, the current DGP Sulakhan Singh also wrote a letter for such training
 is letters main unhone police kii image mekaover or kaam karne kii style ko badalane ke liye ek course karwaane kii salaah di thi
 He had said, if we will not be able to change the way police work, then the dream of ideal police will always remain a dream
 singh ne yah bhi likhaa tha ki police ke liye yah jaruri he ki wo kisi dharna yaa pakshpaat ke tahat nyaay na kare
 This letter was also written to include sociologists and psychologists to make this course
 jaise vivek tiwari kii hatya ke baad upi police bartaav sudhaar ke liye training dene kii baat kah rahi he thiv aisi hi training kii charchaa badaayun thane main ek naaballig ke saath hue balaatkaar ke samaya uthi thi
 DCP Sharma of the time had said, 'complaints of poor police behavior are constantly coming
 ' aise main police ke bartaav ko sudhaarney ke liye ek training program shuru kiya jayega
 The question arises that why should the police administration take care of this reform program only after an incident? Questions have also been raised from time to time regarding the human rights of a police constable
 unki chhuttiyaan or bhatton ko lekar bhi sudhaar kii jaruraton ko samay-samay par uthaaya gaya he
 But all those recommendations have not yet been taken into account
 police ko bartaav sudhaarney kii training kaa khyaal bahut acha he
 But this idea can really be brought into reality only when the psychological and social causes of the reasons behind this behavior are deeply investigated
 police ke upar kis tarah ke dabaav hote hai
 How do they control it after working in a stressful environment? kyonki rog kaa ilaaj uski jad main hota na ki tahaniyon or tanon main

" ’ Who does not know the power of social media, but who would have thought that social media connecting people and communicating with each other will ever be effective in saving someone's life? But it happened, social media gave new life to Taki Hassan, who is battling between life and death
 33 saal ke lakhanu nivasee taki hasan peshey se electrician kaa kaam karata he
 Taki went abroad to fulfill his dreams
 ek haadase kaa shikaar hone ke baad taki ko maaloom padaa ki uske dayee aankh ke upar maathe main ek tumor he
 So he returned to his country to get his treatment
 iske baad maanon taki ke sapane ek-ek karke tuutane lage
 Due to recurrent tumor sickness, along with physical weakness, we also started feeling weak emotionally
 or isaki vajah thi wo gambhir beemaari, jo ek-do nahin balki chaar surgery ke baad bhi baar-baar taki kii jindagi main laut rahi thi
 According to Taki Hassan, despite having surgery not once or four times, Taki's head starts to ache again after 10-15 days
 cancer jaisi thi beemaaridhire-dhire taki kaa vajan girane laga tha
 Taki became emotionally weak along with physical weakness
 aarthik halaat bhi khasta hote ja rahe the
 Actually the head was suffering from sarcoma disease
 visheshgyon ke mutabik ye beemaari ek tarah kaa cancer he, jisaki vajah se taki ke maathe par ek tumor baar-baar ubhar rahaa tha
 Despite four surgeries, this serious disease was not giving up the pursuit and the case was getting worse
 bachane kii haalat main nahin taki hasandhire dhire cancer kaa ye infections taki ke dayee aankh tak pahunch gaya or taki ko apni ek aankh ganvaani padi
 Dr
 Mandeep Malhotra, Head of Head, Neck and Breast Oncoplasty Department, Fortis Hospital, said that when Taki came to the hospital, his condition was very critical
 lagbhag ek aankh ja chuki thi or infections dhire-dhire brain tak pahunch gaya tha
 The tumor orbit was rapidly spreading to the face
 jis halaat main taki hasan fortis pahunchaa tha, aise marijon ke bachane kii sambhaavna bahut kam hoti he
 According to experts, in such cases, 30 percent of people continue to suffer from illness for a long time due to infection
 soshal media se mili badi aarthik madadtaki kii haalat itani kharaab ho chuki thi ki infections uski duusari aankh or brain tak pahunch rahaa tha or uske paas kisi privet or bade aspataal main ilaaj karaane ke liye paise nahin the
 So the family members of Taki were advised to ask for help from social media
 phir kya tha fasebuk or watsaypp ke jariye taki ke rishtedaaron ne madad kii guhaar lagaai or dekhte hi dekhte australia or america ke sikh or muslim community se duaon ke saath paison kaa bhi intjaam ho gaya
 With the help of social media, the family of Taki got about 8 lakh rupees which made Taki Hasan's complicated operation in Vasant Kunj Fortis Hospital possible
 aasaan nahin tha taki kaa oparationoparishan ke liye rakam kaa intjaam jarur ho gaya tha lekin oparation itnaa aasaan bhi nahin tha kyonki ye apni tarah kaa pehla cese tha, jisamen rhite said kaa scal puri tarah damege ho gaya tha or use ricover karte hue marij kii jaan bachaana bhi doctoron ke liye chunauti thi
 In this operation which lasted for 16 hours, the patient's face was reconstructed from the skin of the waist

 If we do this, no service like doctors, army, fire brigade and police will survive
 ham bharat vaasiyon ko ek hokar kaam karnaa chahie
 Mamta further said that if an incident happens then the police arrest all the culprits
 doctor ke pradarshan vaali ghatana par bolte hue unhone kaha ki ghatana sthal par maine apane mantriyon ko bheja
 He said that the police commissioner was also sent to the scene of the incident

 The patient's family was happy as we took care of them

 Whatever happened is condemnable

 In 99 percent of the cases, we all control but one percent of the matter gets out of control

 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said on Friday that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is expected to get shocking results in her state, as the party will get a big Rasgulla (zero) here
 mamata banerjee ne yah tanj kendriya vittamantri arun jetali kii ek tippanee par ksaa he
 Jaitley said that the coming Lok Sabha elections will bring shocking results in the Northeast, Bengal and Odisha
 unhone kaha ki is baat main bhi andeh he ki bhaajapa ko uttar pradesh main 13 bhi siten aaengi
 He claims that the BJP will not get 100 seats across the country
 balurghat main ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue banerjee ne kaha, "vittamantri (jetali) ne kaha ki bengal or odisha chaukaayenge
 i say that in Bengal they (BJP) will be amazed to find Rasgulla and Rajbhog
 jetali ne guuruuvaar ko ek twit main kaha, "purvottar, bengal or odisha is loksabhaa chunaav main chaunkaane vaale parinaam denge
 Currently, BJP has two mps in Bengal
 darjeeling se es
 s
 ahaluwalia or asanasol se babul supriyo saansad hai

 " rajasthan lok seva ayog ne rajasthan prashasnic or adhinsth seva chayan pariksha kaa is saal se puraa pattern badalane kii taiyaari kar lee he
 The state cabinet has given it the green signal
 ayog ne pradesh bhar ke kareeb 50 visheshgyon ko bulaakar is par charchaa karke antim praaroop taiyaar kar liya he
 The structure of two papers and 8 questions in the main is being changed in the Preliminary Examination (prelims), which has been in Rajasthan Administrative Services (RAS) selection for decades
 ab ve abhyarthi jo rajya prashasnic seva main aana chaahate hai, unhen rajasthan kii janajatiyon or unki samskruti kii jaankaree hona jaruri hoga
 The new draft of the commission will examine whether the administrative officer has the ability to solve the problem
 use prabandhan or rajasthan kaa gyaan jaruri hoga
 The Secretary of the Commission Drs
 ke
 K
 pathak bataate hai, ''visheshgyon ke antim praaroop ko ayog kii haai kor cameti ko bheja ja chukaa he
 The next RAS exam will be according to the new pattern
 '' nai pranali main ratane kii jagah samajhane kii takneekee kaa moolyankan kiya jayega
 The course has been finalized after discussions with all the Vice Chancellors, academics experts and subject matter experts
 kala vishay main paramparaagat prashnon kii jagah saamaajik sthiti, pareshaani or uske hal par prashn puche jaaenge
 Economics and Commerce questions will be practical
 prashasnic seva chayan main pehali baar krishi, bagwani, pashupaalan or paryaavaran jaise vishyon ko bhi joda ja rahaa he
 Questions like Logical Strength are being included to bring equality like IAS exam
 bhashaa ke vishyon main bhi rajasthani sahitya or boliyon ke prashnon ko shaamil kiya ja rahaa he
 The most important change is that the general knowledge test of the candidate will be made prominent
 abhi tak hota yah tha ki vishay se sambandhit prashnon ko poochkar pariksha puri kara lee jaati thi, lekin abhyarthi main rojaanaa kii samasyaon kaa kitna gyaan he, iskaa moolyankan nahin ho paata tha
 New course likely to be released by next month
 abhi tak praarambhik pariksha main saamaanya gyaan or vigyaan ke saath ek vaikalpik vishay kii vastunishth pariksha hoti thi
 Now it will also include reasoning, general knowledge and information of Rajasthan
 mukhya pariksha main abhi tak aath prashnptr aate the: do vaikalpik vishyon ke chaar prashn patr, bhashaa ke do, angreji or saamaanya gyaan / vigyaan
 The new draft will have four papers, with two examinations in language and general knowledge and two optional subjects
 ab prashnon main rajasthan ke itihaas, parampara or arthvyavastha ko centre main rakhaa jayega
 Every year, lakhs of students make a fortune in the RAS exam
 snaatak hone ke baad se hi kai saal tak isaki taiyaari kii jaati he
 Most students prepare for administrative service in other states together with IAS and RAS
 ab inhen arees pariksha kii taiyaari alag se kerani hogi
 In RAS, thousands of students from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi also try their luck and many have been elected
 par ab in vidhyaarthiyon ke liye rajasthan ko jane bina chunaa janaa mushkil hoga
 Although most students believe that the inclusion of subjects like reasoning in the new system would be better, questions based on typical Rajasthani might be overshadowed by them

 aisa he ki ham romantic sho, drama, thriller vagairah khub banaate hai, lekin 'dharmapatni' in sabase alag he
 It is a positive show, with a social message relevant to the youth
 'dharmapatni' kaa aadhaar yah vichaar he ki har safal vyakti ke peeche ek majboot mahila hoti he
 
 
 What was the reason for saying yes to 'dharmapatni', her story or director

 'dharmapatni' main aapaki bhoomika pichley kirdaaron se kitni alag he
 
 
 The Mohan's character in 'dharmapatni' is not based on Gandhi's life, and it needs to be seen with an open mind
 bahut baar ham apane samaaj kii galat chizon kii nakal kar baithte hai or jab ghatnaayen manamafik nahin hotin, tab ham niraash ho jate hai
 Mohan's character is that of a man who has become frustrated with things around him and wants to stay away from them all, and that is why he wanders off
 yah charitra ujagar karata he ki har insaan multah acha hota he, lekin paristhitiyaan use acha yaa bura banaati hai
 
 
 You have worked with Aasia Kazi on the show, how was your work experience with her

 As far as Asiya is concerned, i am working with him for the first time, but we have already come face to face and we have joked with each other

 The Friendship Day is a special day for your friends on all your days
 
 
 kabhi-kabhi ham hafton tak ek-duusare se nahin mil pate hai, lekin jab bhi ham aapas main baat karte hai, aawaaj main vahi pehle vaala lagaav barkaraar rahata he
 The real meaning of friendship is to celebrate this relationship one day and remember them even when there is no continuous contact, no matter what
 mere liye friendship de doston ko apane liye khaas hone kaa dhanyavad dene kaa din he
 
 
 i congratulate all my fans on Friendship Day and pray that you all celebrate this colorful bond

 In the political battle of Uttar Pradesh, the Congress may not have found a place in the alliance of Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party, but in the seats where the family leaders of these parties are contesting elections, they are showing favor to each other
 
 ab congress ne aisi hi 6 siton par apane ummidavaar na utaarne kaa faisla kiya he
 Earlier, while announcing an alliance with BSP President Mayawati, SP President Akhilesh Yadav had said to give Rae Bareli and Amethi seats to Congress and decided not to field candidates for these seats
 congress ke saath gathbandhan ke sawaal par akhilesh yadav lagaataar ye kah rahe hai ki congress ko do siten di gai hai, jo sonia gandhi va rahul gandhi ke chunavi kshetra hai
 The Congress, which has released the first list of 11 candidates, has also shown great heart
 congress ne aisi 6 siton par chunaav na ladaane kaa faisla kiya he, jahaan akhilesh yadav va mayawati khud chunaav ladenge yaa unke parivaar se koi chunaav ladega
 The Congress will not field candidates on these seats! It is believed that now the Congress Party has decided to leave Mainpuri, Firozabad, Kannauj and Azamgarh seats vacant 
 in chaar siton ke alaava agar mayawati kahin se ladati hai to us seat par bhi koi ummidavaar nahin utaara jayega
 Explain that Mulayam Singh Yadav from Mainpuri, Dimple Yadav, wife of Akhilesh Yadav from Kannauj and Akshay Yadav, son of Ram Gopal Yadav from Firozabad, are going to contest

 Interestingly, Dharmendra Yadav is currently MP from Akhilesh Yadav's family
 aise main ab is seat se bhi congress ummidavaar hataane par vichaar chal rahaa he
 While showing big for the congress-bsp family in negotiating strong seats, the Congress is also exploring the possibility that the sp-bsp's support will be a sign of where its position can win
 priyanka gandhi ko upi main utaar kar congress jis tevar se aage badi thi, philhal wo naram padate najar aa rahe hai
 On the question of rethinking the alliance, Akhilesh has also put a stop by saying that there is no time left, the table cannot be decorated again for the alliance
 aise main sapa-basapa or congress alag-alag ladate hue hi andruni taur par ek sahmati ke saath bijepi ke khilaaf chunavi ran main utarane kii yojana par chalati dikhaai de rahi he

 Opposition parties have repeatedly raised four main issues: First, that TRS rule is autocratic, the state has been transformed into a fiefdom of kcr's family, in addition to KCR, KTR, his nephew and the state's irrigation minister

 According to him, the alliance between these two parties is unprincipled
 bhale hi khud tiares 2009 kaa chunaav tidipi ke saath milakar ladi thi
 KCR is upset that the opposition parties have become one and the mathematics of the alliance is in his favor

 Has KCR made a big mistake by getting it done before the election time and not giving any valid reason for it?

 What to do KCR - Change the first list of candidates and include those confident of winning in it - persuade the old veterans to wait for the Lok Sabha elections or wait for the chances of the other fat posts
 Explain why they avoid coming to the secretariat and why they agreed to hold assembly elections nine months ago - punish rebels and their supporters, as needed Then remove them from the TRS to make it clear that the party is under their control - also make it clear why the representation of women is so low (not at all in the cabinet) whereas in the last elections in 2014, 74 of the men 74% of the women as against the percentage of votes

 saamaajik kaaryakarta or purv congressi netaa nafisa ali lakhanu se samaajawaadee party kii ummidavaar hongi
 Initially the party wanted to give tickets to Sanjay Dutt, but the Supreme Court did not allow him to contest the election
 uske baad party ne nafisa ali ko tikat dene kaa faisla kiya
 This was announced by SP general secretary Amar Singh at a press conference
 samvaadadaata sammelan main nafisa ali or sanjay dutt bhi maujuud the
 Amar Singh said that Samajwadi Party has an old and close relationship with Nafisa Ali
 vahiin sanjay dutt ne kaha ki nafisa unki bahan jaisi hai
 Kolkata-born Nafisa contested the 2004 South Kolkata seat against Mamata Banerjee on a Congress ticket
 haalanki sanjay dutt ke baad unki patni manyata dutt ko samaajawaadee party kaa ummidavaar banaae jane kii bhi atakalein lag rahi thi
 Nafisa Ali is pitted against Akhilesh Das from Congress to BSP and Lalji Tandon of BJP
 sunakar chunaav kaa aankalan karne kaa jo fan he, vah shaayad dekhakar yaa bolkar nahin
 If you are patient to listen to what people are saying at the chowk-chaubare, then you will be able to see a different picture of the election
 tivi camera chaalu karte hi ab log man kii kam, dikhne ke liye zyada bolte hai
 If a supporter comes out, you will start loudly taking the name of your party or leader
 lekin jab voter apane ekant main hota he, jab vah do-teen logon ke bich hota he or baaten kar rahaa hota he, tab uski baton ko suna janaa chahie
 TV anchors rarely get its good fortune, yet if you want to listen, you can listen while remaining unaware
 basharte khud hi bolne kii beemaari se grast na hon
 a few days ago, Mukulika Banerjee's book 'Y India Votes?' By London School of Economics
 Was studying mukulika ne is baat kii padtaal kii he ki log kyon vot dete hai
 Identified the elements that make up a voter
 kaise ek matadaata apni is pahchaan ko baaki anya pahchaan kii tulana main sabase zyada keemtee samajhataa he
 He keeps the identity card as such, as the jewelry is kept in the family
 isi kitaab ke saaye main main is baar dilli kii galiyon main ghoomte hue logon kii baaten sunne laga
 Asked less, heard more
 is chunaav ne loktantr ko samajhane kaa behtareen maukey die hai
 a more mature example of how India's voters think about their governments is going to meet the Delhi election results
 mujhe is dauraan vot dene ke kai kaaran sunai die, lekin sabase pramukh kaaran tha ek majboot awaz kaa hona
 Many voters underscored this one deficiency at the top
 isamen doctor se lekar fal bechney vaala tak shaamil he
 People of every section said that after the Lok Sabha elections, the voice of the opposition has been lost
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saamne koi awaz nahin uthaata
 i also asked that you wanted this to have strong and strong leadership
 logon ne jawaab diya ki ham yahi chaahate the, lekin ham yah nahin chaahate the ki vipaksh kii awaz na ho
 Do not compete
 yah loktantr ke liye acha nahin he
 This conscience of the simplest voter taught me such a lesson in the role of public in a democracy, which i could not know from the debate of TV studios
 may 2014 main sarkaar banane ke baad bijepi ke har bade netaa ke bhaashan kaa yah ahm hissaa tha ki desh main vipaksh nahin he
 The leader is not even up to the opposition
 dilli chunaavon main bhi amit shah is baat ko zarur bolte ki vipaksh ko aisi bhayankar sazaa mili he
 The public was sensing these statements of the BJP in its own way
 use kai maukon par laga ki vipaksh kii awaz kaa na hona thik nahin he, to us kami ko bharne ke liye partiyon kii taraf dekhne lagi
 The Congress had a chance, but it fell loose
 baaki kisi dal ne yah bidaa nahin uthaaya
 Akhilesh Yadav or Nitish Kumar did not show the kind of activism that was expected in becoming the opposition
 mayawati ne routine press conference kar aalochana to kii magar sadak par koi vipaksh nahin tha
 One reason was that they did not have any number to form an opposition in Delhi
 congress netaa rahul gandhi chunaav ke aakhri dinon main baahar to nikle magar der kar di
 The role of the opposition dealt with the formality of the roadshow
 har jagah aam logon ne kaha ki compatishan nahin hoga to ek hi aadmi kii manamaani chalegi
 a vegetable seller said that the voice should be raised
 hamen pradhanmantri se koi shikaayat nahin he
 He is doing a good job, yet there must be someone to raise his voice
 jab usase poocha kyon, to jawaab detaa he ki pataa kaise chalegaa ki sarkaar jo kah rahi he, vahi sahi he
 The second opinion will not be known
 hamaara matadaata loktantr kii is buniyadi zarurat ko aise samajhegaa mujhe abhas nahin tha
 i would not be surprised if some educated professor said this, but from this hotel waiter to the taxi driver, he was looking for a voice of opposition through this election
 shauchalay nahin hone kii shikaayat karne vaali ek mahila ne kaha ki awaz uthaane vaala hota he to pataa chalata he ki sarkaar sahi kar rahi he yaa galat kar rahi he
 That is, the public does not want to know only the opinion of the government
 vah sarkaar par vishwaas karne se pehle use vipaksh ke mat se mila lenaa chaahati he
 Hearing this from the mouth of all the people i used to talk to, i kept bowing
 unhen narendra modi se koi khaas shikaayat nahin thi, koi gussa nahin tha, magar ye log dilli chunaav ke zariye ek awaz dhundh rahe the, jo desh main vipaksh kii awaz ban sake
 People felt that no one could stop the BJP
 bijepi se koi puch nahin paa rahaa he
 The BJP will later get an opportunity to consider why the public started thinking like this
 kai logon ne yahaan tak poocha ki kya yah sahi baat he ki media swatantra nahin he
 An old man said that we are BJP voters, but you question
 kade sawaal kiijie
 Why there is no voice in the country
 kai jagahon par logon ne kaha ki do sarkaron ke bich muqabla ho hi jaae
 We want to see who works well and who does not
 is baat ke baavjood yah baat bhi sunai padi ki centre or rajya main ek party kii sarkaar rahegi to zyada vikaas hoga
 This line was also heard very prominently
 log baat karte mili ki dilli main centre kii party kii sarkaar hogi to takaraav kam hoga
 The plans will pass soon and will be implemented
 isi awaz ke dam par dilli chunaav ke kantedaar hone kaa bharosa banataa chalaa gaya
 In this election, the voters of Delhi were going through the dilemma of searching for the government for Delhi and the voice for Delhi, from which the rule of India runs
 survey or eggzet pole ke nattejey jo bhi aae, lekin dilli ke matadaataaon ke man kii baat ko sunne main kai dal chook kar gaye
 He had a chance to fill this empty space
 aam aadmi party ne iskaa laabh uthaaya
 In the fight, he claimed that he had the courage to be a voice
 jo janata saal bhar pehle majboot netritv dhundh rahi thi, vahi ab us netritv ke saamne ek majboot awaz khojane lagi
 People have voted less for the mandate of forming a government for Delhi, more for the voice of the opposition
 samajashastri or raajnneetishastri dilli chunaav ke nateezon kaa kai prakaar se moolyankan karenge
 But this election has put before us a new character of the voter
 ek saal pehle tak jo matadaata ji-jaan lagaakar modi-modi kar rahaa tha, vahi ab modi se bina nafrat kiye kisi or ko pasand kar rahaa tha
 According to his passion a year ago, you can say that it will not think of anyone other than Modi
 yah modi bhakt ban gaya he yaa bijepi kaa voter he
 Remember, it was said about this voter that it likes Arvind Kejriwal and Modi, but will only vote for Modi in the Lok Sabha
 aisa hua bhi
 But is it not amazing that the same voter turns and turns towards his other loyalty, due to which the Aam Aadmi Party is being told ahead in the race to form the government
 matadaata varg kii aisi dohari nishtha bahut kam dekhi gai he
 That too in such a short interval
 main raajnneeti kaa koi ghaagh vidwaan nahin hum, magar ek chaatr ke taur par dekhte-dekhte laga ki aisa bahut dinon baad dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 It may have happened earlier but it is happening for the first time according to your memory
 khaataa-peetaa madhyamvarg kaa vahi matadaata, jo shaadiyon main band galaa pahanakar jaataa he or samsung ke mobile se selfi khinchataa he, kah rahaa he ki centre main modi ko vot kiye the, rajya main kejariwal ko
 There is no place for communalism in the dual loyalty of this voter
 samskruti or naitik shiksha ke naam par die ja rahe anargal upadeshon ko vah sun to letaa he, magar jaanata he ki is tarah kii raajnneeti se uskaa bhavishya surakshit nahin ho saktaa
 He comfortably bears religious identity, but does not tolerate communalism in its name
 vah agar secular raajnneeti ke dhakoslepan se nafrat karata he, to use sampradayik raajnneeti ke iraadon se bhi chidh he
 Who is this voter? This is the voter who is secular, who is irritated by the secular (ill) politics of the Samajwadi Party or the Congress Party, but understanding that it is communal is why you are making a mistake
 yah matadaata varg bijepi ke kai saansadon ke sampradayik bayanon ko bhi manyata nahin detaa
 It is clearly understood that the place of religion is somewhere else
 raajnneeti dharm ke masale ko lekar chalegi to hindu-musalmaan vaad vivaad pratiyogita banakar rah jaaegi
 This dual-loyalty voter is on track
 vah kai dalon ke bich kaam ko lekar muqabla dekhnaa chahta he
 Healthy competition in which maximum public benefit
 dilli chunaav kaa nateeja kisi ke bhi haq main aae, magar ek majboot vipaksh kii awaz kii chahat kaa factor nazarandaaz nahin kiya ja saktaa
 i have written what i have heard the people of Delhi talking over the course of a few weeks
 chunaav ke samay kaan lagaaya kiijie
 Who is saying what mujhe to yahi sunai diya ki vipaksh majboot hona chahie or ek awaz to honi hi chahie
 Initiating to curb the incidents of poisonous liquor in West Bengal, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday said that the state government will help people in the illegal liquor business to start another business
 jile ke varisht adhikariyon ke saath baithak ke baad mamata ne patrakaron se kaha ki jahrili sharaab pine kii vajah se kaaphi sankhya main log maare gaye
 We want people who trade illegal liquor to leave and start other businesses
 mamata ne kaha ki ham iske liye ek yojana kii shuruyaat karenge taaki in logon ko ek saamaajik suraksha uplabdh ho sake
 It is noteworthy that at least 171 people died due to drinking poisonous liquor near Sangrampur railway station in South 24 Parganas district a few days ago
 multibrands khudara kshetra main pratyaksh videshi puunji nivesh (epadiai) ko lekar sansad ke aagaamee sheetasatr ke dauraan ranneeti par charchaa ke liye bijepi sansadeey dal kii baithak aagaamee 20 november ko nai dilli main hogi
 Former BJP national president Venkaiah Naidu said, 'bjp's parliamentary party will meet on 20 November under the chairmanship of senior leader LK Advani to discuss the strategy adopted by the Center on 51 percent FDI in multibrand retail trade
 Will be
 ’unhone kaha ki samprag ko uske nirnay waapas lene ke liye sansad ke bheetar dabaav banane ke liye bijepi rajg ke pramukh ghatak dalon ke saath vichaar vimarsh karegaa taaki videshi companiyon ko retail kshetra main dukaan kholane kii anumati nahin mili
 In response to a question asked by the Left parties on the notice given under Rule 184 to debate and vote on FDI within the Parliament, Naidu said that the BJP supports the debate and voting on FDI, but the final decision in this regard at the appropriate time
 Will be taken unhone kaha ki congress ko chhodkar mukhyadhara kii sabhi partiyaan kiraanaa kshetra main epadiai kii virdohi hai
 This will make five crore businessmen unemployed
 samprag sarkaar alpamat main aa chuki he isliye ise desh kii janata par vyapak prabhaav padane vaale nirnay lene kaa adhikaar nahin he
 Naidu said that after the withdrawal of support from the Center by the Trinamool Congress, the UPA government was in a minority and it should pass its decision in Parliament in any case
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki samprag ne apane sahyogi dalon se paraamarsh nahin karke khudara vyapaar main epadiai par ekatarfa nirnay kiya he
 Parties SP, DMK and BSP supporting the UPA called for a nationwide bandh in protest against FDI
 bijepi ke varisht netaa ne kaha ki samprag apane vaayade se mukar rahi he
 The then Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and Commerce Minister Kamal Nath had said that Parliament would be taken into confidence before the FDI was approved
 congress ko jawaab dena chahie ki vah apane vaayade se kyon palat gayi he?naidu ne aarope lagaaya ki epadiai par congress jaldbaaji main nirnay kar rahi he jabaki vipaksh main rahete hue usne iskaa virodh kiya tha
 The Center has allowed FDI in retail trade to divert public attention to 2-G spectrum and coal mine scam
 yah mudda aagaamee sansadeey chunaavon main pramukhataa se uthaaya jayega
 Pointing to the misuse of the CBI, the BJP leader alleged that the Center hung a sword on the heads of some prominent leaders of SP and BSP
 gathnabandhan ke liye centre main samarthan bana rahe iske liye samprag sibiai kaa khullam-khulla durupyog kar rahi he
 In a major action, the CBI arrested Mumbai Income Tax Deputy Commissioner Jaipal Swamy on charges of taking bribe

 She was always combative
 dilli gangrape kii shikaar ladki ne 16 disambar kii raat bas main khud ko bachaane ke liye ji-jaan se pratirodh karke na sirf apni bahaduree kaa parichay diya, balki vah apni choti-si jindagi main bhi har roj nai jang ladaa karti thi
 He fought against poverty and fought against all the obstacles around him
 vah mushkilon ke makadzaal se baahar aane or taaja hawa main saans lene kii harsambhav koshish main lagi thi
 He struggled to seize every opportunity that would lead him and his family out of the purview of the lower middle class to a better life
 yahi vajah he ki jab uske dost gapshap karne ke liye jamaa hote to yah 23 varshiya ladki usamen shariq nahin hoti thi taaki vah pados ke bacchon ko tution padhaane kii taiyaari kar sake
 He started teaching tuition from his teenage years and at this age he also started getting a lot of respect from the children who were studying tuition
 kuch to uski tarah physiotherapist hi bananaa chaahate the
 The parents of these children often told them, "they will succeed only when they work hard like their sister
" ” dakshin-pashchim dilli ke is 40 saal puraane ilaake ko kabhi ‘mirzapur gaanv’ kaa naam diya gaya tha, us ilaake ke liye yah ladki hameshaa hi hero thi
 Some of his dreams used to be quite large according to his small house of 25 yards
 uske parivaar ne uske liye ek cameraa banavaa diya tha, taaki vah apane sapanom ko pankh laga sake
 Her father says, "my daughter used to kiss my hand and promise that one day she will change our lives
" ” unki pehali santan, unki taaranhar or unki takat banakar rahane vaali is ladki ne do kamaron ke chote-se makaan ko apni ummiido kii roshni se raushan kar rakhaa tha
 His father was also willing to do anything to fulfill his daughter's dreams
 apane ghar ke ek kone main vah apni kitabon main uljhi rahati thi or apane do chote bhaaiyon ko padhgaye main madad karti thi, phir pados main tution padhaane jaati thi
 One of her friends adds, "she was scared and upset at the thought of missing out on studies
" ” vah yaad karte hue kahati he ki kis tarah ve donon pashchim dilli ke sarkari skool main cycle se jate hue ‘ujjwal bhavishya’ ke bare main baaten karti thim
 He used to get strength from his father, who used to work in two shifts every day, during the day by loading goods at the airport and at night by the security guard
 vah dehradun ke ek institute se physiotherapy kaa course kar rahi thi or jaldi hi apni padhai puri karne vaali thi
 She was to apply for a final internship in Delhi
 dehradun main rahane ke dauraan vah dopaher se 5 baje tak class karti thi or phir shaam 7 baje se subah 4 baje tak kol centre main kaam karti thi
 His friends recall how he licked Chetan Bhagat's novel One Night at Call Center
 16 disambar ko usne life of paai film dekhi thi
 She was to tell the story of the film to her brothers the next day
 unhen ab apni bahan kii kami sabase zyada khalati he
 She was not his friend, he was his idol
 vah jab bhi kaam par ja rahi hoti to apane bhaaiyon se phone par ghanton baat karti or ve bhi apni sari privet baaten use bataate the
 The elder sister had told him that from the day he would get a job, he would stop teaching tuition and concentrate on his studies
 usne apane bhaaiyon ke liye puri yojana bana rakhi thi
 His father explains, "he had just completed a four-year degree in physiotherapy last month
 mujhe puri ummid thi ki jaldi hi use koi acchhee naukari mil jaaegi or vah apane bhaaiyon kii madad karegi
 30,000 in her first job every month
 milte, jo uske pita kii masik aamadani se kareeb chaar guna zyada hoti
 His father says, "I spend Rs
 5,700 a month
" tankhwaah paata hum or overtime karke atirikt 5,000 ru
 i earn meri beti tution padhaati thi, jisase har maah 3,000 ru
 Used to come donon bete tution padhaakar 1,500-1,500 ru
 Used to earn ”usne ek or vaada kiya tha, lekin is baar kisi or se nahin, balki khud se
 One day she will apply for a scholarship and go abroad for higher education, perhaps to become a doctor
 jab vah zyada paise kama legi to ek bada-sa ghar or audi car kharidegi
 At the moment, she was soon to buy Samsung's smartphone
 in sabake baad uske liye paisa koi samasya nahin hone vaali thi
 Her father, now in his village in Ballia, says, “delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit told me that Rs 15 lakh was paid for compensation
 taiyaar rakhe hai, jo mere lautne par mil jaaenge
 i do not know how i will return
 mere paas bilkul paise nahin hai
 “his small village on the border of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar is going to get the first good road and a helipad as Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav is arriving there on 12 January
 ladki ke mrityubhoj ke maukey par
 His mother faints on seeing the card of Mrityabhoja
 pita gusse main hai
 He says, “I have heard that Akhilesh Yadav organized an event for Rs 20 lakh
 dena chaahate hai, lekin main vahaan nahin jaaoongaa
 If they really want to help, they should come to my village

 soniyaji ne mujhe bataaya ki unhone do-chaar sahyogi dalon ke saath baithken kii hai or unki pehali pasand pranav mukherjee or duusari pasand hamid ansaari hai

 However, before meeting the Congress chief, Mamata had said that her demand for a three-year moratorium on the payment of interest on central debt should not be seen in the presidential election by linking the UPA candidate with her party's support
 unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘nahin, nahin, nahin, raashtrapati chunaav main samprag ko samarthan kaa rajya ke vittiya package se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 Both are different things

 This planting is not about trees but to heat the market of speculation
 main is tarah atakalon ke bazaar garm karne kii ninda karti hum
 Mamta said that West Bengal is financially in a critical situation due to the policies of the previous Left Front government, hence they have demanded a ban on the payment of interest for three years
 unhone kaha ki roak kii unki maang salbhar puraani he or uskaa raashtrapati chunaav se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 He said, 'I have demanded a moratorium on the payment of interest on central loans for three years and this loan is not due to me
 yadi roak nahin hogi to kaise ham sarkaar chalaayenge
 Mamta said, 'whatever the state earns, it goes in payment of interest

 Please, do not associate this with the presidential election

 Social activist Swami Agnivesh said that if people quit consuming non-vegetarian food and alcohol, then there would be a decrease in rape cases
 unhone kaha, ham balaatkaar jaise aparaadh ko sirf police ke jariye nahin roak sakate
 
 
 i believe that if people stop eating meat, the incidence of rape will decrease
 is par bahut se anusandhan hue hai
 
 
 If alcohol consumption is stopped, there will be a significant reduction in rape cases
 agnivesh ne kaha ki bahut se aparaadh or haadase sharaab pine se hote hai
 Speaking on the importance of vegetarianism, he said that Japanese scientists recently conducted a study on the oldest person on earth and found that he was a vegetarian
 unhone kaha, is vishwa main hua prayek anusandhan is baat ko ingit karata he ki bakre kaa maance (red meet) sabhi bimariyon kii jad he
 The comments agnivesh ne kaha ki pichley saal 16 disambar kii raat dilli main chalati bas main ek ladki se barbar samuhik dushakarm ke sabhi chah aaropee sharaab pie hue the or yahaan tak ki haal hi main paanch-varshiya bacchee se balaatkaar karne ke aropiyon ne bhi sharaab pi rakhi thi
 In both cases, the accused had drunk alcohol, he said
 isse spasht hota he ki sharaab kii vajah se unhone aparaadh kiya
 Alcohol overcomes man's moral thinking
 agnivesh ne kaha, sarkaar sharaab utpaadan band nahin kar rahi, kyonki isse rajasav praapt hota he

 i do not support it
 maut kii sajaa kisi ko nahin di jaani chahie, yahaan tak ki sansad par hamalaa karne waalon ko bhi
 Even Kasab should not have been punished

 The history of the Sentosa island of Singapore, which is going to be negotiated for peace, is terrible
 do varg mile tak faile is tapu main kareeb 200 saal pehle samudri daakuon kaa aatank hua karata tha, jo vyapaariyon ko lutate the or unako maut ke ghat utaar diya karte the
 Thousands of people were massacred 76 years ago on this island and 35 years ago a huge accident occurred due to the oil-fired ship and two carriage of tourist cable car fell into the sea
 itane bade-bade haadason or dardanaak vaardaaton ke baad logon ne is jagah ko hi shaapit maan liya tha
 Therefore, it was decided to change the name of this island to eliminate its wretchedness and then it got a new name Sentosa
 telegraph ke mutabik saal 1972 tak sentosa dweep ko 'pulau belkang mati' (pulau Blakang Mati) naam se janaa jaataa tha, jiskaa matlab hota he - mrityu kaa dweep (island of Death from Behind)
