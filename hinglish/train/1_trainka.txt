 
 lagbhag teen minute kaa yah video darasal sisitivi footage he, jisamen ek chor dindahaade ghar main ghuskar motorcycle churaakar le jane kii koshish karata dikh rahaa he
 
 
 The attempt was because he was stuck in the 'door', and then when a man from inside the house ran towards him, the thief had to run away to save his life
 
 
 yah video teen saal purana he, yah baat bhi is sisitivi footage par lagi timestamp kii vajah se pataa chal paati he, lekin iske alaava yah ghatana kahaan or kab hui, yah pataa nahin chal sakaa he
 
 
 It is clearly visible in the video that the thief first sits down outside the iron door of the house, and then, by chance, sneaks in and enters, and successfully drags the motorcycle to the door
 
 
 bas, yaheen pahunchakar kismat uskaa saath chhod detii he, or kuch aisa ho jaataa he, jo usne sapane main bhi nahin sochaa hoga
 
 
 While watching the video, where you feel that this motorcycle will be stolen, then the motorcycle gets stuck in the door, and despite millions of efforts of the thief, it does not come out
 
 
 isi dauraan ghar ke bheetar se ek shaks nikalakar baahar aata he, or belcha lekar chor kii taraf daudta he, jiske baad jaan bachaakar bhaagane ke alaava chor ke paas koi rasta nahin rah jaataa
 
 
 The comments video dilachasp he, isamen koi shaq nahin, lekin yah samajhnaa mushkil he ki yah video teen saal baad kyon post kiya gaya, or yah kyon trend kar rahaa he
 
 
 However, if you do not get the answers to all these questions, then there is no harm in its fun, so look at you guys too, and tell us by writing a comment, how did you find this failed theft

 video main saaf dikhaai de rahaa he ki chor pehle ghar ke lohe ke darvaaze ke baahar dubkkar baithta he, or phir mauka paakar daravaaza sarkaakar bheetar ghus aata he, or puri kamyaabi se motorcycle ko ghasitkar darvaaze tak le bhi aata he
 
 
 Just by reaching here, luck leaves him, and something happens that he would not have even dreamed
 
 
 video ko dekhte-dekhte jahaan aapako lagane lagata he ki ab yah motorcycle chori ho hi jaaegi, tabhi motorcycle darvaaze main funs jaati he, or chor kii lakh koshishon ke baavjood nikal nahin paati
 
 
 Meanwhile, a man comes out from inside the house, and runs towards the thief with a shovel, after which the thief has no way but to escape from his life
 
 
 tippaniyan The video is interesting, no doubt, but it's hard to understand why this video was posted three years later, and why it's trending
 
 
 baharhaal, in sab sawaalon ke jawaab nahin mil paaen, to bhi iske mazedaar hone main koi kami nahin aati, so, aap log bhi dekhie, or coment likhakar hamen bataaie, yah naakaam chori aapako kisi lagi

 yahaan piem modi kamrej main chauthi raily ko sambodhit kar rahe hai
 The Prime Minister, while addressing a huge public meeting in Bhuj, responded to the Congress on the allegations related to the development of Gujarat
 is dauraan unhone kaha, 'vikaas hamaara mantra he or vikaas kaa majaak udaane waalon ko janata maaf nahin karegi
 'he told that there is desert in Kutch on one side and Pakistan on the other, no one thought that there could be farming here
 modi ne kaha ki congress ne kabhi gujarat ko dhyaan main nahin rakhaa, ye sardaar patel ke jamaane se ho rahaa he
 Therefore, Gujarat will never forgive Congress
 piem modi ke is bayaan parcongress ke gujarat prabhareene palatwaar kiya he
 Congress leader Ashok Gehlot said the opposite, that the country will not forgive PM Narendra Modi
 gahalot ne kaha, 'modi ji keval lachchhedaar bhaashan dete hai, lachchhedaar bhaashan se janata kaa pet nahin bharta or gujarat kii janata ye samaj chuki he
 Ashok Gehlot said that Modi ji only spends jumla and waxed speech, so the people of Gujarat and the country will never forgive him
 darasal, congress ne gujarat ke vikaas ko chunaav prachaar kaa mudda banaaya he
 Even the Congress used the slogan 'vikas Pagla Gaya Hai' in Gujarat
 haalanki, jab piem modi ne bijepi ke nae naare ke tahat 'main vikaas hum, main gujarat hum' shabd kaa istemaal kiya to rahul gandhi ne vikaas pagalaa gaya he kaa naaraa band kara diya
 After Modi Bhagwana spoke on tea, PM Modi in Rajkot also surrounded Congress with tea
 unhone kaha, 'congress ko dikkat he ki ek chaay vaala unhen takkar de rahaa he
 If the son of the poor becomes the Prime Minister, then he has problems
 main modi hum, chaay bech luungaa lekin desh nahin

 yahaan logon ko sambodhit karte hue unhone kaha ki gujarat kii janata congress kii ahankaar se bhari gujarat virdohi maansikta ko sweekaar karne vaali nahin he

 vicky kaushal se jab poocha gaya ki kya unhen is bare main koi bhi andaja tha ki vah bhi neshnal aword jeetne waalon kii list main hai? to jawaab main vicky ne kaha ki unhen bilkul bhi andaja nahin tha
 In those days he was completely relaxed and was giving a screen test for his next films

 vicky ne bataaya, "iske baad jab meraa naam liya gaya to main hairaan hokar fries ho gaya
 "vicky told that he had to shoot for his upcoming film and the team came from the US to apply prosthetics
 unhone bataaya ki unke puure chehre, sir or kaanon par prosthctic lagaaya gaya tha
 He was neither able to hear nor speak anything
 unhone kaha, "main 4 ghante tak but kii tarah baitha rahaa or ye wo mauka tha jab main puri duniya ke saath masti se jhoomna chahta tha ki maine neshnal aword jeeta he
 "after this he made a phone call to his co-winner Ayushman and close friends and i sat there giving congratulations
 vicky ne apni shuruyaat ko yaad karte hue bataaya ki vah jaanate the ki koi bhi unhen launch karne ke liye taiyaar nahin baitha hua he
 But the mother remembered that she had faith in herself
 unhon kaha ki jab vah industry main aae to vah sari chizon ke liye taiyaar the
 He said that when he got down in all this, he gave several interviews one after the other
 unhone filmon, documentry, web siries or sabhi ke liye audishan die or ek roj jab vah thakkar baithe the tab unki maa ne unhen samajhaayaa ki vah har cheez ko sakaaratmak nazariye ke saath dekhnaa shuru karen or ye maan kar chalem ki sab ho jayega

 ab aisa kya hua ki bharat ne european sangh ke 27 saansadon ko kashmir jane kii anumati de di he

 Not only which party the 27 mps belong to, what is the stand of their parties on Kashmir in their own country, it is not clear at all

 In this case, no press release has been issued, as is usually the case with the activities of the Ministry of External Affairs

 european sangh kii vaais president ne apane bhaashan main kashmir ko lekar chintaa to jataai thi magar bharat ke khilaaf koi prastaav paas nahin kiya tha
 The questions of Kashmir were discussed in the sub-committee on Human Rights in the US Parliament and India was criticized

 Rahul Gandhi was returned from the airport

 ab sawaal uth rahaa he ki european sangh ke un saansadon ko jinke bare main public main koi detail nahin he, nijee daure par jane kii ijazat di jaati he, daure se pehle pradhanmantri se mulaakaat hoti he
 When mps from other countries can go on a private tour then why the leaders of India could not go
 yahaan tak ki ek chaatr mohammad aleem syed ko bhi apane parivaar se milane ke liye supreme court kaa daravaaza khatkhataana padaa tha

 Neetu is believed to be in the news behind doing so
 abhi kuch dinon pehle hi mumbai ke ek charity event menyana guptane bhi apni choti blike dress ke neeche undervier pahananaa bhul gai thim
 Journalists present there had also taken a photo of Yana without panties
 is ghatana ke baad yana kii ‘no panty’ ghatana kii kaaphi charchaa rahi thi
 Yana also faced a lot of criticism for this
 haalanki, yana ne iske baad apni baat rakhte hue is prakaran par kaha ki dance karte vakt camera unhen shoot kar rahaa hota he
 In such a situation, it is not right to repeatedly fix panties in front of the camera
 isliye unhone sochaa ki behatar tarika yahi hoga kii wo panty hi na pahanen
 Yana told that after the practice on the day she had pictures, she did not get time to go home and went straight to the charity event
 yana ne tab kaha tha, ‘mujhe pataa tha ki maine panty nahin pahani he isile main kuch kadamon ke baad baar-baar apni dress neeche kar rahi thi
 i didn't know it would happen
 mujhe yah bhi nahin pataa tha ki kya dikh rahaa he

 dilli main ek baar phir barish hui or phir sadakon par pani bharaa
 But there was a question of responsibility for this, then the swords were drawn between the MCD and the Delhi government
 har baar jab bhi dilli pani-pani hoti he, siyasat main ek-duusare par keechad oochhaalane kaa silsilaa bhi shuru ho jaataa he, lekin dilli police kii ek chitthee ne kejariwal sarkaar kii kalai khol di he or emsidi ko apni collar oonchi karne kaa mauka de diya he
 Delhi Police's DCP Traffic had sent a list of 58 places where heavy water logging took place after the heavy rains on July 11 by the Delhi Police's DCP Traffic, referring to 58 places in the letter
 trephic police ke mutabik in 58 jagahon par barish khatm hone ke kaaphi vakt baad bhi pani jamaa rahaa tha or isaki vajah se trephic jam ho gaya tha
 We have this letter of Delhi Police and a list of 58 places in it
 sabhi sadaken PWD ke adhindilachasp baat ye he ki in 58 jagahon main se emsidi kii ek bhi sadak nahin thi
 All 58 points were on PWD roads, which comes under the Delhi government
 is baat se utsahit emsidi ne dilli sarkaar ko aade haathon lene main koi kor kasar baaki nahin rakhi
 According to Subhash Arya, Leader of the House in the South MCD, the report of the traffic police is also exposing the lies of the Delhi Government, because the Chief Minister of Delhi and the Minister of the Government often curses the MCD for waterlogging, while it is their real responsibility and also the report It is said that PWD is flooding the streets
 peedblyoody mantri kaa tarkjab is bare main dilli sarkaar ke peedblyoody mantristyendra jainase sawaal kiya gaya, to unki daleel badi ajeeb rahi
 According to Satyendra Jain, if water is filled in 58 places this time, then it is a good thing because last year there were more than 150 such places where water was frozen and jammed
 lekin mantri ji ne shaayad dilli police kii chitthee thik se padhi nahin, kyonki isi chitthee main disipi ne ye bhi jaankaree di he ki in 58 jagahon main se sirf 15 jagah aisi hai, jo pehle vaali suchi ke 160 points main shaamil rahi hai, jabaki 40 se zyada nai jagahon par is baar kii barish main pani bharaa he
 In such a situation, the question arises as to when will agencies continue to defend themselves with statements and people will continue to struggle with waterlogging on the streets

 na koi aasraa tha or na hi jeevika kaa saadhan
 Both started wandering from place to place in search of work
 bhatakate-bhatakate donon ek nadi ke tat par pahunche, jahaan unhone raat ko vishram kiya
 At the same time, Sushila noticed that many women were worshiping there with vigor and tying defense threads to each other
 sushila ne unase vrath kaa mahatv poocha 
 All those women were worshiping the infinite form of Vishnu and tying the infinite sutra
 unhone batya ki is vrath ke prabhaav se sabhi ksht dur hote hai or manokamanaayen purna hoti hai
 Sushila followed the fast with the law and after wearing the Anant Sutra, prayed to Lord Vishnu to remove her husband's troubles
 samay ke saath kaunidanya rishi kaa jivan sudharne laga
 They no longer lacked money due to the effect of fasting
 agle saal phir anant chaturdashi kaa din aayaa
 Susheela fasted again to thank God and wore an infinite sutra
 jab rishi kaunidanya ne dhaage ke bare main poocha to sushila ne anant chaturdashi kii mahima bataai
 Also said that all the glory has been got by the effect of this fast
 yah sunakar kaunidanya krodhit ho gaye
 The sage felt that his wife was giving credit for his hard work to God and in anger, he broke the infinite thread
 is apmaan se dukhi anant dev ne dhire-dhire rishi kaunidanya se sabakuch waapas le liya
 The husband and wife again wandered from forest to forest
 phir unhen pratapi rishi mili jinhone bataaya ki unki ye haalat bhagwaan ke apmaan ke kaaran hui he
 Then the sage Kaunidanya was aware of his sin and along with his wife, he fasted with the entire law to an infinite ceremony
 unhone kai saalon tak is vrath ko kiya or 14 saal baad anant dev prasann hue
 God appeared to the sage Kaunidanya and happiness returned to his life
 manyata he ki bhagwaan krishna ne pandavon ko anant chartudashi kii katha sunai thi
 The Pandavas observed this fast every year in their exile
 kaha jaataa he ki satyawadee raja harishchandra ko bhi is vrath ke prabhaav se raaj-paat waapas mil gaya tha
 Gyanendra Shah, the last king of the country amidst the ongoing political crisis over the new constitution in Nepal, said that he had left the palace, not discharged his responsibilities towards the country or the people

 Jayendra said, 'I have handed over the wealth of the people to them and left the palace for national interest, happiness, prosperity and public satisfaction

 The Australian team was back in color again, washing the Indian players in Perth and Team India was once again losing the series by four zeros on foreign soil

 Everything went well in the first Test played in Melbourne
 gendbaajon ne 20 wicket jatke or sachin tendulkar, rahul dravid tathaa virendra sahvaag main se harek ne 50 se adhik ran banaae
 In this way, the match was drawn for five days
 lekin uske baad bikharaav shuru ho gaya
 It was an expression of disappointment in the Indian team when Virat Kohli made a vulgar gesture towards the Australian crowd in Sydney and cried out his ruthlessness
 lekin yah to bahari kaaran tha
 The normally calm Ishant Sharma confirmed the disappointing mood of the team when a go-kart (a four-wheeler) on the track expressed similar sentiments after a day's play
 perth main to sab kuch saamne aa gaya
 a conversation between journalists and former players who went with Mukhtar's Alexander to Ruthie Kismatim indicated that all is not well in the dressing room
 bujurg australian cricket lekhak robert cradak ne herald san main likhaa ki virendra sahvaag test siries main dhoni kii captaini se naakhush khilaadiyon ke ek gut kii aguai kar rahe the
 The players of the Sehwag camp believed that Dhoni has let the team down with poor performances one after the other
 haalanki bhartiya camentataron ke ek tabake ne is bare main sanket dena shuru kar diya tha
 With each passing day it became clear that there was something wrong with the dressing room
 bharat ne behad aruchi or anushaasanheen tareeke se sabhi test match khele
 Virender Sehwag took charge when Dhoni was suspended for the fourth Test in Adelaide
 lekin unhone bhi sabit kar diya ki unki captaini dhoni se na behatar he, na badtar
 It would be called ironic
 bharat edilade test or siries 4-0 se haar gaya
 Dhoni, who is in the news for winning the first World Cup of ICC T20 with a team of young players, has never fit in the traditional mold of captain
 baharhaal, us jeet ne kranti laa di thi kyonki vah varisht khilaadiyon ke bina mili thi
 Looked from outside, it seems that Dhoni leaves because of the old Test players in the team
 ve is tarah ke sanket bhi de chuke hai

 The dressing room has changed completely

 Such is the change
 dressing room shor se bharaa rahata he
 There are different generations of players
 ’team india chaaron khaane chitajab aapane unke is tarah ke vichaar sun liye to aap yahi prarthana karenge ki tendulkar ke ipod main kishor ke gane na hon
 Nonetheless, the senior players were yet to be further insulted
 australian team ke khilaaf antat jab ek jeet mili to usamen main of da match paane vaale gautam gambhir ne elaan kiya ki kuch khaas khilaadiyon kaa na rahanaa bhartiya team ke liye acha hi rahaa
 He told reporters, 'you don't want big names, you want players who can show something
 sabase acchhee team vahi hoti he jiske sabhi 11 khilaadiyon main yah bharosa ho ki ve kisi bhi virdohi team ko haraa sakate hai
 And these 11 players playing were confident that they could beat Australia in this one-day
 ek yaa do khilaadiyon se koi fark nahin padataa
 'who were those one or two players? Were they fans of Kishore Da? Do we need to name them? Suffice it to say here that Tendulkar did not play in that one-day
 jaisaa ki televijan par kaha jaataa
 This was nothing short of a 'bomb blast', Gambhir was also unhappy
 unhone kaha bhi ki match jeetne ke liye do genden rah gai thim
 He was angry at the captain
 agar unka bas chalaa hota to ve match ko pehle hi jeet lete
 Even Dhoni admitted that the Indian team's match against Sri Lanka was tie due to their habit of leaving things till the water passes through the head
 bristben main haar ke baad to bhartiya team kii thu-thu hone lagi
 In this one-day also, Dhoni was suspended due to slow pace of throwing overs
 is tarah, daure main ve do baar suspend ho chuke the
 The captain said that players like Gambhir, Sehwag and Tendulkar fielding at a slow pace, due to which India lost valuable runs
 unhone kaha, ‘gend in khilaadiyon ke paas jane par australian yaa srilankai ballebaaj do yaa teen ran lene kii koshish karenge
 This means that there will be more pressure on our players' bodies as both throw and diving should be good
 in donon chizon ke kaaran un par nirantar dabaav rahegaa
 This will greatly affect our fielding
 iskaa arth he ki hamaare ballebaajon par un atirikt 20 ranon ko banane kaa dabaav rahegaa
 When Sehwag took command of Dhoni again in the next match, he lost another
 is haar par jab tippanee kii gai to sahvaag ne apane 'clasik' kaich ke bare main kaha, ‘aapane meraa kaich dekha? ham pichley 10 varshon se isi tarah fielding karte aa rahe hai
 But Sehwag denied any split in the team
 unhone kaha, ‘ham ekajute hai, khush hai
 He (dhoni) is the captain
 jo chahen ve kah sakate hai
 He addresses the media and has been doing so for the last two years
 hamen isaki aadat he
 'but Team India is telling itself in Australia how many differences there are within it
 aisa pehle shaayad hi dekha gaya ho
 The long duration of the tour and the continuous poor performance are worth their price
 agar aapmen himmat he to ise padhate rahiye kyonki koi bhi pakke taur par kah saktaa he ki yah tamaasha yaheen khatm hone ko nahin he

 congress ke rashtriya mahasachiv digvijay singh ne kaha he ki kai sanghathan desh ke bantwaare ke samay se hi aaj tak desh ko phirakaparasti ke rup main baantne kii koshish kar rahe hai, jabaki hakeekat yah he ki hindutv kaa dharm se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 On the occasion of the 130th Foundation Day of the Congress, Digvijay Singh said at a function held at the Madhya Pradesh Congress Office in Bhopal on Sunday, 'sarva Dharma Harmony is our constitutional heritage
 prayek vyakti ko apane dharm kaa paalan or prachaar kaa moulik adhikaar he
 But the way efforts are being made to divide the country in the name of Hindutva and religion, politics can remain alive, the country will not be able to survive
 'digvijay singh ne kaha, 'congress ne lambey sangharsh ke baad desh ko aazaadee dilaai or is aazaadee ke baad siyaasi yuddh to kai hue, par dharmik yuddh nahin hue, jabaki isai samudaay or islamic dharmavalambee bharat aae or yahaan se chale bhi gaye
 He added, 'india is known because here all religions are respected with equal opportunity and respect
 congress party kii najar main jabaran dharmantaran anuchit he
 Since the Partition of the country, many organizations have tried to divide the country in a form of reclamation till date
 jahaan tak hindutv kaa sawaal he, uskaa dharm se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 'digvijay said,' Hindutva was used by Savarkar, who did not follow Sanatana Dharma himself
 hamaara dharm sanathan he or sabhi ko apane-apane dharm ke paalan or prachaar kaa adhikaar he
 The Congress General Secretary further said, "today, a dual definition is being defined regarding conversion
 aise ghrunit muddon se hatakar aaj sabase badi jarurat desh ke vikaas or ekajutata kii he
 Godse's temple, conduct and words like Ramzada and Haramzade cannot be appreciated in Indian politics
 'digvijay ne kaha ki congressjan is visham daur main sthapana diwas par party kii majbootee ke liye sangharsh karne kaa sankalp len
 On this occasion, freedom fighters Laxmandas Keswani, Anirudh Prasad Shastri, Mangu Devi, Habib Nazar, Mo Jamir, Kalpana Devi and Panchamati Devi were honored with shawl-shriphal

 After the murder of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashogi, a creepy plan was made to hide his body
 al jajira kii ek report main daawa kiya gaya he ki jamaal khashogi kii hatya ke baad sambhav he ki unki body ko ek vishaal avan main jala diya gaya
 Jamal Khashoggi was murdered at the Saudi Embassy in Istanbul city, Turkey
 al jajira ne ek documentry main daawa kiya he ki turki ke adhikariyon ne saudi duutavas ke adhikari ke ghar jal rahe bhatthi kii nigaraanee kii thi
 According to the report, pieces of Khashogi's corpse were brought here and burnt here
 al jajira ne is vishaal bhatthi ko banane vaale ek majdoor kaa intervyuu liya
 The man said that he had made the oven according to the instructions from the Saudi authorities
 shaks ne kaha ki avan kaaphi gaharaa tha, ise itnaa majboot banaaya gaya tha taaki ye 1000 degree kaa taapmaana sab sake
 This oven also had the ability to strangle the metal
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki khashogi kii body ko jalaane ke baad is avan main meet bhi pakaaya gaya taaki puraane saboot mitaae ja sake
 Turkish investigative officials found that Khashogi's blood splatter was found on the walls in the Saudi Counsel's office
 khashogi kii hatya ke baad in deevaaron par nayaa paint kar diya gaya tha
 Al Jazeera has prepared the documentary based on interviews with security officials, Khashogi's Ottoman friends and leaders
 saudi prince ke kattar aalochak the khashogijmaal khashogi saudi arab ke jane-maane patrkaar the
 He was a critic of the Crown Prince
 2 oktober 2018 ko vah turki kii rajdhani istambul main sthit saudi duutavas main kuch kagaji karrwai karne gaye the, taaki vah turki kii apni mangetar hatice cangij se shaadi kar saken
 Saudi Arabia had previously stated that Jamal Khashogi came out of the Saudi embassy alive, but later the Saudi administration admitted that he was assassinated under an operation of some 'rogue elements'
 saudi arab ne is hatya ke maamle main 11 logon par aarope lagaae hai
 However, Saudi has refused to hand them over to Turkey and has said that it will settle the case on its own
 sanyukt raashtra ne is hatya kii ninda kii he or isane nrushans or purv niojit bataaya he
 The United Nations has said that Saudi Arabia is behind this
 buudhvaar ko maharashtra vidhansabha main jo huousaseshivsenaco jo dhakka laga he use vah jivan bhar nahin bhuulegi
 He tried to play both friendship and hostility cards and was defeated
 unhen laga ki ab unke haathon main he lekin bijepi ne jo hoshiyaari dikhaai usase unke haathon ke tote ud gaye
 However, we try to find out what were the 10 reasons that made the army's mathematics deteriorated
 1
 The Shiv Sena was playing the wrong card from the beginning
 chunaav ke pehle vah bijepi se siton ke liye tolmol kar rahi thi
 His tough stance made the BJP high command realize that the party will continue its position in future and it will continue to cause problems
 2
 The BJP wanted to contest the election with the Shiv Sena but on the question of ticket distribution, it turned away from it
 shivasena ne tatasth bhav se chunaav ladane kii bajaay bijepi or yahaan tak ki piem narendra modi kii bhi ninda kerani shuru kar di jo anuchit tha
 When there are differences between the two political parties, the relations between each other do not deteriorate as much as the Shiv Sena did
 shivasena supremeo ne modi or unke samarthakon ko afjal khan kii sena se tulana karke apana khel kharaab kar liya
 3
 shivasena kii sabase badi samasya yah rahi ki uske paas manje hue raajnneetijna nahin he
 The party has sidelined the old politicians like Manohar Joshi
 aise main unhen samay par salaah dene vaala koi anbhavi netaa nahin rahaa
 4
 uddhav thakare hameshaa isi ummid main rahe ki bijepi unki baton ko antat maan legi
 He had half the members in the assembly as compared to BJP members but he was seeking ten ministerial posts including Deputy Chief Minister, Home Minister, Finance Minister which was a huge demand
 5
 The Shiv Sena did not keep any such channel with which they could keep in touch with the BJP high command
 yah saadhaaran si baat he or hameshaa aisi vyavastha kii jaati rahi he
 Uddhav Thackeray felt that Matoshri is where all BJP leaders come to attend
 yahaan par vah chook gaye or samay ko pard nahin paae
 6
 chunaav ke baad vah apni jid par ade rahe jabaki ensipi ne bijepi ko bina shart samarthan de diya
 He failed to understand this trick and kept on talking to BJP
 maharashtra congress or ensipi main diggaj raajnneetijna hai jinke saamne uddhav kahin nahin thaharte
 7
 jabavidhansabha spikar kaa chunaavho rahaa tha to shivasena ke manager dhang se pattey khel nahin paae or uske baad jab bijepi ke netaa ashish shiller ne vishwaas prastaav rakh diya to uske netaa uskaa puri takat se virodh hi nahin kar paae
 They should have demanded a division of votes
 jab tak ve kuch samajhate spikar ne haa ke aadhaar par sarkaar ko vishwaas mat milane kii ghoshnaa karvaa di
 8
 sena ke zyaadaatar vidhayak sadan main bhramit rahe
 They did not understand what to do in such a situation
 unke paas ek netaa kii kami saaf dikh rahi thi
 9
 shivasena ko hameshaa yah ummid thi ki bijepi vishwaas mat ke samay jhuk jaaegi or unki baat maan legi
 Hence the party continued to show undue bravery
 10
 Uddhav Thackeray takes time to take any decision and is not able to take a quick decision
 iske alaava vah sadan main bhi upasthit nahin the
 This spoiled the entire party game
 party ke vidhayak samaj hi nahin paae ki bijepi kaa kitna virodh hona chahie
 Now it is to be seen whether Uddhav Thackeray separates from NDA or not? The coming time for the party is tough
 agar vah endie se alag hote hai to unki party ke tuutane kaa khatra mandaraayega
 When many big leaders of the party left his side and went to the other side during Balasaheb's time, anything can happen now

 After the adjournment of the meeting, many members including SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, JDU leader Sharad Yadav, RJD leader Lalu Prasad and BJP deputy leader Gopinath Munde went to the Prime Minister, Leader of the House Pranab Mukherjee and Congress President Sonia Gandhi for a long talk
 Seen doing dhai baje sadan kii baithak dobaaraa shuru hote hi pradhanmantri ne aashwaasan diya ki main sadan ko aashwast karnaa chahta hum ki is mudde par cabinet jald hi faisla karegi
 His assurances were strongly welcomed by the whole house thumping the tables
 manmohan ke aashwaasan par lalu ne kaha ki aap par puure sadan kaa bharosa he or is aashwaasan ke baad hamane apana andolan roak diya he
 Mulayam supported Lalu's talk and thanked the Prime Minister and Sonia

 Vikram Bhatt has described the creator of 'creator 3D' as a result of chemical reaction, inspired by mythology
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik mythology se prerit yah krichar kuch or nahin balki ‘chandi paath’ tathaa ‘durga saptshati’ sahit hamaare vaidic granthon main paae jane vaale brahm rakshas kaa hi ek rup he
 Brahma Raksha means that which has demonic qualities along with the deity
 yah bhi kah sakate hai ki rakshasi gunon vaala devtaa yaa ek aisa devtaa jo rakshasi gunon vaala he
 According to ancient legends, a specialty of the Brahman demon is also that he can be transformed into an animal like a cat, dog or birds whenever he wants
 vikram ne pracheen kathaon ke saath dakshin bharat ke mandiron kaa daura kar brahm rakshas ko ek pashu kaa swaroop diya jise naam mila ‘krichar’
 On this Vikram Bhatt says, through our artistry we created this creator

 "
 yah tasviren fasebuk pej"loksabha 2019 BJP 380+"or"manila vs punjabi"aadi ne bhi share kii he
 To find out the truth of these photos going viral, when we did a reverse search, we found an article published on 17 February 2017 on the blog titled "the Startup — Medium", in which these pictures were used
 ‘the passport-concept’ he dalline ke saath prakashit hue is blog ko diziner or in jeniyar siddhant gupta ne likhaa tha
 Siddhant had proposed an "all-in-one identity" card through this passport design to replace banks, licenses, registrations, ID proofs and voter ID cards, etc
 is artical main istemaal kii gai tasveeron ke neeche "concept dizin" likhaa gaya he, yani ki yah keval ek aam naagarik kii taraf se diya gaya suzav he
 Significantly, in the year 2017, the Modi government announced the issuance of chip-bound e-passports
 videsh mantralayane rajya sabha main puche gaye ek sawaal ke jawaab main isaki pushti bhi kii thi
 After this, on 22 January 2019, on the occasion of Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also announced that the e-passport bearing the chip will be issued soon
 tamaam pratishthitmedia sansthanone is khabar ko pramukhataa se prakashit kiya tha
 According to e-passportmedia reports, the front and back cover of e-passport will be made slightly thicker
 isamen back cover main post stamp se bhi choti ek silicon chip or ytaakar antina laga hoga
 This chip will save important information related to the passport holder such as photos, fingerprints and details of about 30 visits
 is software ko iaiti kanpur or neshnal informatics saint (NIC) ne milakar taiyaar kiya he
 The Indian government is bringing out the e-passport soon, but the viral photos are the concept design of an engineer
 yah keval ek aam naagarik kaa suzav he, final dizin nahin he

 Sahara decided to break ties with the BCCI just hours before the IPL auction started in Bangalore
 sahaara ne bisisiai ke saath ek july 2010 ko nayaa praayojan anubandh kiya tha jo 31 disambar 2013 tak prabhavi he or iske tahat use prayek test, ekadivasiy or antarrashtriya twanti20 match ke liye board ko teen karod 34 lakh rupee dene he
 The agreement is believed to be worth Rs 532 crore
 sahaara pichley saal ipel se judaa tha jab usne pune frenchiji ko 1702 karod main kharida tha or is tarah yah team is twanti20 pratiyogita kii sabase mahangi frenchiji bani thi
 If no solution is found then the BCCI could suffer a loss of around 2000 crores
 board haalanki koi or praayojak dhundhakar is nuksaan kii bharpai kar saktaa he
 The reason for the differences between the two sides was Sahara seeking an alternative to Yuvraj Singh, who is undergoing treatment for malignant lung tumors in the US
 frenchiji chaahati thi ki yuvaraj kaa 18 lakh dollars kaa vetan unke 16 lakh dollars kii nilaamee raashi main shaamil ho jaae
 The team initially had $ 2 million for the auction but spent four million dollars on keeping Sourav Ganguly with them
 tippaniyan The BCCI refused to accept Sahara's request and did not even consider Ganguly an option for Yuvraj so that the team could land with a full auction amount of $ 2 million
 ek anya mudda yah tha ki sahaara ne team ko 94 maichon ko dhyaan main rakhkar kharida tha jabaki pichley saal toornament main sirf 74 match khele gayen
 Sahara wanted the amount of reduced matches back
 sutara ne kaha, ‘kuch faislon ko kaary samiti se sweekruti milani jaruri he isliye aaj unki ghoshnaa nahin kii gai

 kuch saansad maanate hai ki soshal media data chauri karne waalon ke khilaaf sakhti se karrwai karne ke liye behad zaruri he ki sarkaar nayaa kanoon banane par gambhirtha se vichaar kare
 NCP leader Tariq Anwar told NDTV that like Aadhaar, now cases of data theft from social media are coming to the fore
 or sarkaar ko doshiyon ke khilaaf sakhti se karrwai karne ke liye nayaa kanoon banane par vichaar karnaa chahie
 The Congress compared this entire situation with Singur and Nandigram in West Bengal, intensifying attacks on the Mayawati government of Uttar Pradesh for the violence over the land acquisition question in Noida
 congress pravaktaa manish tiwari ne un sujhaavon ko khaarij kar diya jisamen kaha ja rahaa tha ki agar bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon main sanshodhan se sambandhit vidheyak sansad main lambit nahin hota or raahat tathaa purnvas niti ko manjuuri mil gai hoti to aisi sthiti nahin ubhartee
 He requested the UPA government to pass both these important bills
 tiwari ne is daawey ko khaarij kar diya ki trinmul congress adhyaksh mamata banerjee ke virodh main hone ke kaaran yah paas nahin ho saktaa he
 Tiwari said, 'the Congress strongly condemns the manner in which the oppression was imposed on farmers around Noida in western Uttar Pradesh
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘kaaran chaahe jo bhi rahaa ho manshaa kisi bhi kyon na rahi ho, basapa sarkaar kii mukhyamantri ne jis tarah se lathi goli ke sahare vikaas kii ek nayi parampara daalane kii koshish kii he 
 The results will be far-reaching
 ’tiwari ne kaha, ‘hamaari maang he ki kisaanon ke khilaaf jo atyaachaar hue hai uski ucch stareey nyaayik jaanch honi chahie or peedit kisaanon ko uchit muaavja milanaa chahie
 Also, the state government should talk to farmers immediately and find a way out
 ’ congress pravaktaa ne kaha, ‘baat sahi he ki bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon main sanshodhan sambandhi vidheyak pichhali loksabhaa se paarit hua tha lekin chaudaavin loksabhaa bhang ho jane ke kaaran yah kanoon nahin ban sakaa
 Tiwari said that the development car cannot be carried forward unless the local people are made partners in the development, whether it is Singur or Nandigram or any other part of the country
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ko jald se jald is vidheyak ko sansad ke samaksh laana chahie or is kanoon par dobaaraa se raay banaakar usamen sanshodhan kiya janaa chahie
 The Congress spokesperson also said, "but this does not mean that democratic governments talk to the people through sticks
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘‘yah matlab nahin ki isaki aad lekar atyaachaar or julm kiya jaye 
 No law allows such barbarity
 ’tiwari ne ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha, ‘kisi samasya kaa ati sarleekaran nahin kiya janaa chahie
 We are not in the right to take government servant hostage
 hinsa kii aisi karrwai kaa ham samarthan nahin karte
 But there is a need for sensitivity and to communicate with people
 ’isse pehle party ke mahasachiv or uttar pradesh maamalon ke prabharee digvijay singh ne aarope lagaaya ki mayawati sarkaar kisaanon ke sawaal ko lekar puri tarah se asamvedansheel he
 He said that instead of talking to the farmers and taking them into confidence, this government is taking violent action against the agitating farmers
 ham isaki nyaayik jaanch kii maang karte hai
 He condemned the incident and said that the state government is taking away their land from farmers and giving it to big industrial houses
 kisaan pichley chaar maheene se gharne par baithe hai lekin us par koi dhyaan nahin diya gaya
 Their demands are correct and the BSP government is responsible for this entire incident

 ) Indian team paceman Munaf Patel believes that it is a golden opportunity for the team to win the upcoming ICC World Cup
 unka maananaa he ki team jab vishwa cap jeetne ke apane abhiyaan kii shuruyaat karegi to santulit team ke alaava anukool paristhitiyaan or gharelu darshakon kaa samarthan mahatvapurn kaarak sabit honge
 Munaf said that the Indian team had won the World Cup under the leadership of Kapil Dev in the year 1983 and the team has a golden opportunity to repeat that history in the World Cup cricket tournament starting on 19 February
 unhone kaha, ‘vishwa cap ke sabhi 19 match bharat, bangladesh or srilanka main khele jane hai
 So the support of wickets, weather and spectators will be in our favor
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘isi kaaran se meraa maananaa he ki hamaari team vishwa cap jeetne kii prabal daavedaar he or ise jeetne kaa uske paas sunaharaa mauka bhi he
 Do not get a chance to play cricket in domestic pitch and favorable conditions
 ’munaf ne kaha, ‘bhartiya upmahadweep kii pichen vishwa cap main bhartiya team ke liye anukool paristhitiyaan banaaengi
 The bowlers of the team have complete information about the conditions of the pitches here and they also know what to expect from them
 ’ munaf ne kaha, ‘vartmaan team kaaphi majboot sthiti main he
 The team has some of the best batsmen, fit all-rounders and bowlers who are in full form and have been consistently doing well for some time
 ’chotil hone ke kaaran kaaphi samay team se baahar rahane vaale munaf philhal apni fitness par dhyaan kendrit kar rahe hai kyonki vah chotil hone ke khatre se tang aa chuke hai
 After recovering from injury, Munaf's bowling has improved a lot and now he is paying special attention to maintaining good line and length
 pichley vishwa cap toornament main chot ke kaaran apni sambhaavna ke anuroop pradarshan nahin kar paane vaale munaf ne kaha, ‘main apni gend sahi jagah par daalane ke saath uski line or length barkaraar rakhane kii koshish kar rahaa hum jisase mujhe wicket praapt karne main kaaphi madad mili he
 In view of the performance of the Indian team of late times, Munaf's opinion seems to be quite right as the team beat New Zealand at their home and presented a strong challenge in the ODI series after finishing the Test series draw with South Africa

 Shaprio has denied Headley's extradition because this American citizen of Pakistan has confessed his crime to the US government and has given critical information about various terrorism organizations to US investigative agencies, along with supporting the US government
 shapriyo ne 20 panne ke dastavej main kaha, ‘jaisaa ki adaalat ko maaloom he ki hedli kii gavaahi se bhi tahawwur rana ko doshi tehraane main madad mili
 In addition, Headley also agreed that if he was called by the US Attorney's Office, he would be willing to testify in any judicial proceeding in the US, even outside the country, through video conferencing or a letter of grace

 Attorney General Gary S
 Shaprio said in a 20-page document stating the state of the US government that the government believes that Headley will be sentenced to 30 to 35 years in prison, taking into account the facts
 shapriyo ne kaha, ‘is baat kaa koi sawaal hi nahin he ki uskaa aapraadhik vyavhaar nindaneey tha lekin uske sahyog kaa faisla bhi kaaphi mahatvapurn he kyonki isane sarkaar ke aatankwaad se ladane ke prayaason main or sarkaar ke siforeeshon main madad kii
 'the US government is demanding a sentence of 30 to 35 years, which is far less than the punishment demanded by the Tahawwur Hussein Rana case, which the federal grand jury has helped lashkar-e-taiba's equipment and a Danish newspaper in Copenhagen Has been convicted of plotting the attack
 pichley saptaah adaalat ne rana ko 14 saal jail kii sajaa or baad main reeha hone par paanch saal tak nigaraanee main rahane kii sajaa di he

 Shaprio said, "despite so many people being killed and devastated in Mumbai in November 2008, Headley visited Denmark less than two months later to reconnaissance to plan another terrorist attack there
" ’ shapriyo ne kaha, ‘hedli ne na keval varshon tak lashkare taiyaba balki alqaida ke sadasyon ke nirdesan main kaam kiya
 The US Attorney said, "there is no doubt that the sentence of life imprisonment for Headley's very serious crime would be appropriate, but it should also be kept in mind that he greatly assisted in the investigation
" ’ is bich america sarkaar ne kaha he ki giraftaar ke baad hedli ne jo suchnaayen muhaiyaa karai vah sarkaar tathaa uske sahyogiyon visheshkar bharat ke liye antarrashtriya str par aatankwaad se nipatane main kaaphi mahatvapurn raheen

 He said that Headley cooperated in the investigation of foreign officials and answered the questions of the Indian authorities for a full seven days and the government hopes that it will help in future
 shapriyo ne kaha ki isko dekhte huye sarkaar adaalat se anurodh karegi ki aaajeevan karawas se kam kii sajaa di jaye

 jordan ke fiter payalat muath al-kasasbeh ko iesas ne jinda jala diya
 Two lines in Arabic language emerge at the end of this one minute 24 second shocking video
 iesas ne inhen liya he 12veen shatabdi ke muslim scollar ebn tamaiyya ke nyaayashastra se-"yadi kisi apavitra sharir ke khaufnak ant se kafiron ko islam par bharosa hota he yaa unka akraman kamjor hota he, to aisi sajaa jari rahanaa chahie or jehad main isaki kanuunan ijaajat he"
 Then in the 12th century
 
 
 ebn tamaiyya ne yah baat us daur main kahi thi, jab mongolon ke khaufnak hamale madhya or madhya-purv asia hi nahin bharat main bhi hua karte the
 They kept on going ahead with looting, slaughtering of men and children and raping women

 The slogan was that the new country would rule only on the basis of Sharia

 All Muslims unhone shiya, kurd or yajidi jatiyon ke bhi anginat logon kii jaan lee
 The special thing is that every slaughterhouse, whether the victim is Muslim or non-muslim, must have made his video

 In each video, the first message was given in the name of Islam, threatening the US and European countries and then putting both hands on their knees and killing them
 kahin sir par goli maari gai, kahin dhire-dhire galaa renta gaya, kahin talwaar se ek jatke main gardan alag kar di gai

 But his murderer argued that even though he reads the Quran, it is un-islamic for him to be a friend of America
 or use maranaa hoga

 It is said that she is a woman
 aag dhire-dhire pinjre main pahunchati he or lapten kasasbeh ko gher leti he
 Kasasbeh first tries to remove the flames by hand, then hides with his hand to avoid them
 slomoshan vaale is video main kasasbeh kii tadap, uske ghutanon par baithne or phir laash ho jane tak manjar he
 Finally, when Ibn Tamaiah's said lines emerge on the video, the face of Kasasbeh, scorched behind him, is visible
 itihaaskaaron ke anusaar 12veen shatabdi main mongol bhi jab katleam karte the, to ve use zyada se zyada vibhats or khaufnak banane kii koshish karte the
 Ibn Tama'iyya then called him a threat to Islam

 congress upaadhyaksh banane ke baad rahul gandhi kaa bhaashan aakhir kis bare main tha? rahul ke bhaashan main hindi or angreji ko milakar kareeb 4000 shabd the, lekin puure bhaashan main 10 shabd aise rahe jiskaa istemaal rahul ne kai baar kiya
 If we look at these 10 words, understanding the real India, listening to the voice of the common man, transfer of power and ending loose attitude were the main points of Rahul's speech
 ye kaha rahul gandhi ne bhaashan main, ‘pehle main yuva congress or enesayuai kaa prabharee evam party mahasachiv tha
 i am now the Vice President of the Congress Party
 aapako yah nahin mahasoos karnaa chahie ki rahul keval yuvaaon kii baat karata he
 Rahul's family now consists of all the Congress, Youth Congress and Mahila Congress
 aaj se rahul gandhi sabhi ke liye kaam karegaa
 i want to promise that i will treat you equally whether they are young leaders, experienced leaders or women
 main sabaki sunuunga
 'rahul Gandhi said,' As it used to be earlier, there were a dozen leaders like Nehru, Patel and Maulana Azad and any of them could become PM
 ye baat hamen paidaa kerani he ki 40 se 50 aise netaa taiyaar rahen jo jarurat padane par piem yaa siem ban saken
 Such should be the case at every district and every state level and if anyone asks what the Congress does, then we can say that the Congress prepares a leader for the country
 dharmanirpeksh or janata se jude netaa or logon kii samasyaon ko samajhane vaale netaa, netritv nirmaan ke liye dhaanche kii jarurat he
 Rahul Gandhi said, 'I don't know everything
 duniya kaa koi bhi aisa vyakti nahin he jo sab kuch jaanata ho
 i will act as a judge in the party, not as a lawyer
 ’ rahul ne kaha ki 1947 main bharat aaazaad hua, aazaadee hathiyaaron se nahin balki ‘aawaaj’ se mili
 Other countries fought independence for violence and weapons but we fought non-violence
 sabane kaha aisa sambhav nahin hoga lekin hamane british hukumat ko ahimsa ke jariye desh se bhaga diya
 10 words that Rahul has used many times, India / Indian 24 voice 22 power 9 change 8 violence 4 knowledge 4 youth 4 Gandhi 4 election 3 ordinary 3 paanch rajyon ke chunavi rujhaanon ke bich sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ne shairana andaaj main ek dilachasp twit kiya he

 - Akhilesh Yadav (@yadavakhilesh) December 11, 2018 This tweet by Akhilesh Yadav comes at a time when 'bad news' is coming for BJP from Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh
 twit main akhilesh yadav ne bijepi par tanj karte hue teen rajya uske haath se nikalne ke rujhaanon par shaayari kahi he
 However, SP had distanced itself from the opposition meeting a day earlier
 yahaan dekhen madhya pradesh chunaav ke nattejeyaj rajasthan, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh, telugana or mizoram ke chunaav parinaam aane vaale hai
 Counting of votes continues

 At the same time, despite applying full emphasis in Telangana, BJP does not seem to have any special benefit
 chhattisgarh ke nattejey yahaan dekhempaanchon rajyon main hue vidhansabha chunaavon ke nateezon par puure desh kii najar lagi he
 While political experts will see the impact of these results on the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, for the political parties, any major reshuffle in these assembly elections can also act as a bell of danger
 yahaan dekhen chunavi rujhaan main koun aage-koun pichherujhanon par grahamantri rajnath singh ne kaha he ki ye shuruaati aankade hai
 He said that wait for the election results to come
 ummid he ki sab acha hoga
 At the same time, Sharad Yadav said that we knew in the three states that the Congress government would form
 kisaan, noujvaan yaa dukandaar ho, notebandi ne sabaki tabaahi kar di

 isi kadi menchthhatsappne apane yugers ke liye ek nayaa feechar‘blue ticks’pesh kiya
 But it seems that now whatsapp is worried about the privacy of its users
 isliye jald hi company nae feechar ‘blue ticks’ ko opshanal yani vaikalpik karne ja rahi he
 After the new update, the user sending the message is now getting the information of reading the message as well under the new feature 'blue Ticks'
 iskaa asar yah hua ki ab aap aapke doston se bahaanaa nahin bana sakate ki aapane massej nahin padhaa he
 Because as soon as you read the message, both the ticks on the message turn blue
 company ne ab blue ticks’ feechar ko vaikalpik karne kaa man bana liya he or iske liye testing kii ja rahi he
 Many whatsapp users say that when they downloaded the application directly from webisat, 'blue ticks' have been given as an alternative in it
 is feechar kaa abhi difolt rup main aana baaki he, lekin yugers centings main jaakar ise of kar sakate hai
 It works in the same way as the 'last scene' feature of whatsapp
 ‘last seen’ feechar ko bhi band kiya ja saktaa he
 Once you turn off the 'blue ticks' feature, neither will you see the read message nor the person sending the message to you
 kai baar massej padhane ke baad bhi ham use nazarandaaj karnaa chaahate hai to yah ‘blue ticks’ feechar yujar kii privesi main dakhal detaa he

 narendra modi, arvind kejariwal or rahul gandhi- ye teen naam aise hai jo kareeb har din kisi na kisi vajah se surkhiyon main rahete hai
 The eyes of the country are fixed on these three leaders
 in hastiyon ke bare main bahut kuch pataa he to kud aisi baaten bhi hai jinhen log jaananaa chaahate hai
 Signature expert and logo designer Manaklal Aggarwal is telling about the appearance and nature of these three
 dilli ke purv siem or aam aadmi party ke netaa arvind kejariwal ke dastakhat se pataa chalata he ki wo behad bhavuk insaan hai
 They cannot forgive themselves for any mistake
 kejariwal ko impress karnaa bhi behad kathin he
 But, their weakness is that they start doing something with half-finished preparation and due to this, work has to be left in the middle
 bijepi ke piem candidet or gujarat ke siem narendra modi kaa dastakhat bataata he ki wo aatmavishvaas se labarej hai or unhen kaaphi jaankaree he
 They do any work with complete preparation but if someone insults them, they do not forget it
 unamem netritv kaa gun kuta-kuta kar bharaa he
 According to the testimony of Rahul Gandhi, the Congress prince, he is a hardworking person and does any work with better planning
 lekin unki kamajori yah he ki kisi kaam main kuch dikkat ai to rahul use bich main chhod dete hai
 a Delhi-based court has sent a woman who has been sexually abused for two months, along with two others, for 30 years, to a prisoner for 30 years
 court ne uttar pradesh nivasee shiva ko 30 varshiya mahila ko galat tarah se bandhak banane, uske saath samuhik balaatkaar karne or dushkarm karne, chot pahunchane or aapraadhik dhamkee kaa doshi tehraaya he
 The court said that the crime committed by the convict is very serious, disgusting and serious in nature
 court ne spasht kiya ki shiva ko pehle balaatkaar, aapraadhik dhamkee, galat tarah se bandhak banane or chot pahunchane ke liye 10 saal kii kaid kaatani hogi or uske baad samuhik balaatkaar ke aparaadh ke liye 20 saal ke sashram karawas kii sajaa shuru hogi
 Shiva's two other associates could not be arrested
 haalanki court ne mahila ke is daawey ko khaarij kar diya ki shiva ne ek train se use agava kiya, jisamen vah apane pati or bacchon ke saath kanpur se raibareli ja rahi thi
 The judge said that it could not be believed how a sensible woman could be abducted from such a crowded train compartment
 court ne yah bhi kaha ki mahila kii ore se bataae gaye saboot ishaara karte hai ki vah swechha se shiva ke paas gai hogi or mahaj isse yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki vah shiva ke saath rangareliyaan manaane gai thi
 The court also imposed a fine of Rs 55,000 on Shiva
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi mangalvaar ko nagpur main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) pramukh mohan bhagwat se milenge

 yahi nahin congress netaaon ne somvaar ko aankade pesh karke gujarat ke vikaas kii pole kholane kii bhi koshish kii
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the country for the second time on demonetisation
 piem modi kaa ye sambodhan aaj shaam 7
 It will be 30 o'clock
 isamen kai kalyankari yojanaon kaa elaan bhi sambhav he
 It is believed that on the occasion of completion of 50 days of demonetisation, PM will thank the people of the country, who maintained restraint despite the difficulty
 saath hi in 50 dinon main sarkaar ne kya-kya kadam uthaae unka byora bhi diya jayega
 The demonetisation took place on November 8
 Last time, on November 8, in his address to the nation, Prime Minister Modi announced to stop the circulation of old notes of 500 and 1000 rupees for striking black money
 logon ko apane puraane note bainkon main jamaa karaane ke liye sarkaar ne 30 disambar tak kaa vakt diya tha, jo ki ab khatm ho gaya
 In such a situation, there is every hope that the Prime Minister can make some big announcement regarding demonetisation
 kisaanon or mazdooron par ho saktaa he elaanakentre sarkaar kisaanon, berozegaar yuvakon, bipiel pariwaron or vriddhjanon ke pension par gambhir se vichaar kar rahi he or pradhanmantri raashtra ke naam apane sambodhan main is par bhi koi ghoshnaa kar sakate hai
 With this, the Prime Minister can make some important announcements like continuation of subsidy to promote digital payments
 benami sampatti par ho saktaa praharavahin notebandi ke elaan ke baad pradhanmantri kai baar kah chuke hai ki kaale dhan ke baad ab benami sampatti par prahaar kiya jayega
 In his 'mann Ki Baat' program aired on the radio, the Prime Minister had clearly indicated this
 is vajah se 31 disambar ke is sambodhan main benami sampatti ke khilaaf bhi kuch bade faislon ummid he

 jab maine gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke taur par isaki kalpana kii thi, to kabhi ahsaas nahin tha ki pradhanmantri ke taur par mujhe ye punya kaam karne kaa mauka milegaa
 i am very grateful for the people of Gujarat who have supported me in this work
 kaarykram main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki main jis mitti main palaa badha, jinke bich main main badha hua unhone ne hi mujhe sammaan patr diya
 It is just like a mother laying her hand on her son's head
 unhone kaha ki mujhe loha abhiyaan ke dauraan mili, lohe kaa pehla tukdaa bhi diya gaya he
 We had also sought soil from the people in this campaign
 desh ke lakhon kisaanon ne khud aage badhkar is shubh kaam ke liye loha or mitti di
 i wanted to make the mountain sculpted
 The Prime Minister said that today i am remembering those old days, i am also feeling like saying a lot
 kisaanon ne in pratimaa ke nirmaan ko andolan bana diya
 When i put forward this idea, there was an atmosphere of doubt
 jab ye kalpana man main chal rahi thi, tab main soch rahaa tha ki yahaan koi aisa pahaad mil jaae jise tarashkar murti bana di jaae
 But that could not be possible, then this form was conceived
 sirf sardaar main dikhti thi ashounhone kaha ki sardaar patel ne us samay khandit pade desh ko ek sutara main baandha, tab maa bharti 550 se adhik viraasaton main banty hui thi
 There was a lot of disappointment about India's future in the world, even then there were many pessimists
 unhen lagata tha ki bharat apni vividhtaon kii vajah se bikhar jayega
 Then everyone saw only one ray, this ray was Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 sabhi rajavaadon ko ek saath laae the patelpradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki 5 july 1947 main riyasaton ko kaha tha ki videshi aakrantaon ke saamne hamaare aapasi jhagade, aapasi dushmani, bair kaa bhav hamaari haar kii badi vajah thi
 Now we do not have to repeat this mistake nor be a slave to anyone
 dekhte hi dekhte bharat ek ho gaya, sardaar sahab ke kehane par sabhi rajavaade ek saath aae
 He said that i also have a dream, a virtual museum of all the princely states should be prepared by connecting with this place
 varanaa aaj to koi tehsil kaa adhyaksh bhi apana pad nahin chhod saktaa he
 He said that Sardar Patel included Kautilya's diplomacy and Shivaji's valor
 
 
 
 So vizapm Modi had to take for Somnath temple, no matter how much pressure, no matter what the differences, but how has governance been established in the administration, it has been shown by Sardar Saheb
 agar sardaar sahab ne sankalp nahin kiya hota to aaj gir ke sher ko dekhne ke liye or shivbhakton ke liye somnath kii puja karne ke liye, hyderabad main charminar ko dekhne ke liye vija lenaa padataa
 He said that if Sardar Saheb had not been there, it would have been very difficult for us to create an administrative structure like civil service
 sardaar ke sankalp se hi kashmir se kanyakumari tak train chal paati he
 The Prime Minister said that this statue is meant to remind those who question the existence of India that this nation was eternal, eternal and will be eternal
 sardaar ko mila haq kaa sammanofn modi ne kaha ki is pratimaa ke nirmaan se jude sabhi mazdooron, shilpakaaron kaa main dhanyavad detaa hum
 Those who are directly and indirectly associated with this work have also become a part of history
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki 31 oktober, 2010 ko maine iskaa vichaar duniya ke saamne rakhaa tha, karodon bharatiyon kii tarah mere man main ek hi bhaavana tha ki jis mahapurush ne desh ko ek karne ke liye itnaa bada kaam kiya use wo sammaan milanaa chahie jiskaa wo hakdaar he
 Tribals will get employment PM Modi said that the construction of this statue will provide employment to the tribals, if tourists come here now, they will bring employment for the poor
 aaj kaa sahakaar andolan jo desh ke anek gaanvon kii arthvyavastha kaa majboot aadhaar ban chukaa he, ye sardaar sahab kii hi dein he
 The Statue of Unity is an example of the strength of our country's engineering and technology, a unity nursery should also be built here
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki yahaan ke chaaval se bane oona manda, tahala manda, dhokala manda yahaan aane vaale paryatakon ko pasand aaenge
 Tourists who come to see Sardar Saheb will also be able to visit the mountains of Sardar Sarovar Dam, Satpura and Vindhya
 unhone kaha ki ye murti new india kii abhivyakti he
 People are watching our campaign through the prism of politics, PM Modi said that some people in the country are seeing this movement through the prism of politics, we are criticized for praising the sons of the country
 jaise hamane koi bahut bada aparaadh kar diya ho, hamaari koshish he ki bharat ke har rajya ko sardaar patel ke vijan ko aage badhaane main koshish kerani chahie

 work front kii baat karen to salmaan in dinon film bharat kii shooting main biji hai
 The film will be released on the occasion of Eid
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne rajya ke vidhayakon ko tohfa diya he
 After the passage of the budget of 2016-17, the Chief Minister announced that the government will provide accommodation to the mlas who do not have housing
 purv vidhayakon ke pension main ijafokhilesh ne ye avasavidhayakonko lakhanu main uplabdh karaane kaa elaan kiya he
 The mlas welcomed the cm's decision
 yahi nahin, purv vidhayakon kii pension das hajaar se badhaakar 12 hajaar rupee karne kii bhi ghoshnaa kii
 Apart from the agenda of mlas, the CM also announced the facility of reboring of 100 hand pumps and 100 hand pumps in all legislative constituencies
 saath hi har vidhayak ko 8 kilo meter haat mixsadakbanane ke liye dhan uplabdh karaayaa jayega
 After years of efforts, the central government has once again decided to increase the minimum wage through the Labor Law Reform Bill 2019 in organized and unorganized sector to protect the interests of workers
 pichhali baar aisi koshish 2017 main hui thi jab loksabhaa main rakhaa gaya tha or phir ise standing cameti ko bheja gaya lekin ye kabhi paas nahin ho sakaa
 What is in the bill? This bill includes four existing laws related to workers' wages - Payments of Wages Act - 1936, Minimum Wages Act - 1949, Payment of Bonus Act - 1965 and Equal Remembrance Act - 1976
 is
 code on vegej main nunatam mazdooree ko har jagah ek samaan lagu karne kaa praavdhaan he
 With this, every laborer can be ensured a uniform salary across the country
 is bill main mazdooree se jude tamaam muddon jaise barabari kaa vetan, vakt se pement or bonus ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 The minimum wage includes basic wages, living expenses and spending cuts
 saath hi isamen majdoor kaa hunar, mazdooree main honi vaali mehnat or bhugolic sthiti kaa bhi akalan kiya janaa he
 On this basis, the central and state governments will decide the minimum wage
 ab tak kanoon ye kahata tha ki 24 hajaar rupee paane vaale karmchaariyon kii hi jaruri katautee or vetan dene kii samay seemaa tay thi, nae kanoon ke tahat sabhi karmchaariyon ko ye suvidha milegi
 To prevent such disturbances, now inspector cum instructors will be hired, earlier the labor inspector used to see this work
 sansadeey samiti ne inspector ko hataane par aapatti jataai thi unka maananaa tha ki isse kanoon ko lagu karne main dikkatein aaengi isliye ab nae nirdesh jari kiye ja rahe hai
 There is also a provision in this bill that one or more officers can also be appointed for this so that the promises can be disposed of quickly and cheaply
 vetan ghataane, bonus na dene or vetan katautee ke maamalon main sabit karne kii jimmedaari naukari dene vaale kii hogi
 In this bill, the period for making such claims (from 6 months to 2 years) has been increased to three years
 is bill main praavdhaan he ki har paanch saal main nunatam mazdooree badhaai jaae or vetan dene main technology kaa istemaal kiya jaae
 Why changes are being made? According to the reasons for introducing the bill, its purpose is to equalize and simplify the wage laws
 isse zyada industry lagengi or rojgaar kaa srijan hoga
 Also, it will directly benefit the common laborers
 is bill ko duusare rashtriya shram ayog ke siforeeshon ke aadhaar par banaaya gaya he
 The Economic Survey of 2018-19 shows what are the flaws in the salary system of the country
 karyanvayan kii chunautiudyog jagat ne sarkaar ke is faisle kaa swaagat kiya he
 The chairman of cii's National Committee on Industrial Relations, MS Unni Krishnan, has said that changes in the minimum wage law will prevent exploitation of workers
 lekin rajya sarkaron ko sasti lokapriyata ke chakkar main nunatam mazdooree ko itnaa nahin badha dena chahie ki udyog jagat ise sambhaal hi na paye
 The labor unions of the country are divided on this bill
 The BMS, which is associated with RSS, is calling this bill historic, says BMS President CK Sajinarayan that this bill will also bring the last laborers working in the society under the law
 vahiin vamadal samarthit trade union situ ko is bill par kai aapattiyaan hai
 Union General Secretary Tapan Sen says the Code on Wages Bill does not include a solid minimum wage formula (based on 2700 calories per day intake)
 is formule ko 15veen bhartiya shram conference main sarvasammati se apanaaya gaya tha
 Sen alleged that the new bill practically left the government and bureaucracy's decision to fix the minimum wage
 haalanki tripaksheeya nunatam mazdooree salaahkaar board kaa praavdhaan bill main rakhaa gaya he lekin ise is tarah dizin kiya gaya he ki board kii siforishein sarkaar par baadhya nahin hongi
 Prof KR Shyam Sundar, an economist at the Xavier School of Management, says the bill is impressive, indicative but suspecting its credibility as the government does not have a comprehensive system to implement it
 2018-19 kaa aarthik survey kahata he ki desh ke ek tihaai se zyada majdoor 1948 ke nunatam mazdooree kanoon ke tahat nahin aate
 This bill will bring more people under the minimum wage law, so it is more difficult to implement when you are reducing the authority of the Labor Inspector
 unka ye bhi maananaa he ki sarkaar ko kam se kam mazdooree tay kar deni chahie, cost of living ke hisaab se isamen baad main samaayojan kiya ja saktaa he
 Said Netaji was also lodged in a single night, trust over 100 lawsuits will be over, the cases against Azam will be ended
 Former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav attacked the governments of the country and the state fiercely
 shuukravaar ko rampur pahunche akhilesh ne patrakaron se baat karte hue kaha ki netaji (mulaayam singh yadav) par bhi ek hi raat main sau se adhik mukademe darj hue the
 Later all the lawsuits ended
 unhone kaha ki ab ajam khan par mukademe darj kiye ja rahe hai
 We have full faith in the court
 yah mukademe bhi samaapt ho jaaenge
 The SP president defended his party MP Azam, saying that this university is not made for us
 ajam khan ne ise isliye banwaaya taaki aane vaali peedi sahi raste par chale
 He said in question that who else does such a big job? The SP chief also referred to the feeding of salt roti in the primary school in Mirzapur and the incidents of rape in Unnao and Shahjahanpur, referring to the solidarity of women mps after remarks on Rama Devi in the Lok Sabha
 akhilesh ne kisi kaa naam liye bagaiyr kaha ki main mahila saansad se jaananaa chahta hum ki unnav hua kahaan hai aap? shahjahanpur main bhi ek beti ke saath rape hua, kahaan hai aap? unhone bhaajapa kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki bhaajapa kaa asli cheharaa yahi he
 It can remain in power for a few days, but not for long
 jinpar darj hai kai mukademe, hamen kehete hai gundon kii partispa adhyaksh ne kaha bhaajapa vaale hamen kehete hai gundon kii party he
 Tell how many cases are there against the Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister of the state
 unhone kaha ki jis pradesh ke mukhyamantri or upmukhyamantri aise hon, unase kya ummid kii ja sakati he
 Akhilesh alleged that the government changed the cabinet due to corruption
 centre sarkaar par bhi saadhaa nishandkhilesh yadav ke nishane par keval yogi sarkaar nahin, centre kii modi sarkaar bhi rahi
 Akhilesh criticized the Modi government for the defense corridor along with demonetisation and alleged that the number of counterfeit notes increased by 10 per cent after demonetisation
 unhone kaha ki jis tedi aankh se pakistan ko dekh rahe ho, hamen jaraa maansarovar bhi dilaa do
 The SP chief said that there is no one greater than Lord Shiva
 unhone kaha ki mandir bhi baaki he
 The BJP cannot give us a certificate of being a Hindu
 vah hamen pichhadaa hindu samajhate hai
 Said, every action is a reaction Akhilesh, who is seen in the whole rao, while taunting the Modi government, said that those who can cheat Ganga, they can cheat anyone
 dilli vaali science hamen nahin pataa, lekin ek cheez pataa he ki har ection kaa ek ulta riection hota he
 Before going to jail for changing the government, the Chief Minister said that he knows one thing about gravity
 jo upar jayega vah neeche aayega
 He said that the government has been formed every time he has gone to jail
 akhilesh ne kaha ki sarkaar badalanaa chaahate ho to jail janaa padegaa
 He said that governments keep coming and going
 adhikari aaenge or jaaenge, lekin ham yaheen rahenge
 The officer had touched the feet to become DGP
 The former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh said that an officer had come to touch my feet in uniform to make me DGP
 baad main naam kaa khulaasa karne kii baat kehete hue unhone daawa kiya ki maine usase kaha ki umr main chota hum
 Do not do this
 akhilesh ne kaha ki aisa yah sarkaar karti he
 It is worth mentioning that after more than six dozen cases were filed against SP MP Azam Khan, Mulayam Singh Yadav called upon the party workers to agitate in his favor

 5 starjohn Abraham and Sonakshi Sinha's 'force 2' is released at a time when viewers are wondering how to return old and discontinued notes of 1000 and 500 rupees
 sarkaar sahi he yaa galat, aise sawaalon se ghire hue log film dekhne ke kitne mood main hai ye andaaza lagaana koi badi baat nahin he
 This will definitely affect the opening of the film
 haalanki acchhee film phir bhi darshakon ko khinch hi le jaati he
 While there, if beaten, the entire note will come to the detention
 kaisaa he kahani kaa suspence'force 2'ection thriller he jiskaa pehle part 'force' se koi matlab nahin he sivaay iske ki yahaan bhi jon bina vardi ke police officer hai or ro se judi hai sonakshi sinha
 How the RAW agents are killed one by one in China and one of them is John, the childhood friend of ACP Yashvardhan and then goes to Budapest with John Abraham, Sonakshi Sinha and plotting to avenge the friend's death
 Manage to catch the one
 interval ke baad sust raftaarfilm kii shuruyaat hollywood ection filmon kii tarah he
 Doesn't even give a chance to think even a little bit
 jabardast ection or budapest kii lokation, dilachasp lagati hai lekin interval aate-aate lagane lagata he is film main sivaay ection ke kuch bhi nahin he
 What is about to happen after Interval is foreseen and the film ends with a simple climax
 confort jone main sabhi sitarejon abraham kaa ek sa abhinay, dher sara ection or ghisipity kahani is film kii kamjor kadiyaan hai
 John Abraham should focus on different types of stories or else he is seen beating up 20-25 goons in every film
 ek seen bina shart ke or ant main villen ko haraane ke alaava unke paas koi kaam nahin he
 The comfort zone is not good for any artist
 nirdeshak abhinav dev ne kahani se zyada focus takanic par rakhaa he
 All this is tolerated till the interval, but after this the film becomes cumbersome
 villen taahir bhasin kii yah duusari film he or aisa lagata he ki vah apni pehali film 'mardaani' kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahe hai
 His performance is not bad but did not do anything that should be called very good
 vahiin,sonakshi sinha ausat hai
 The work is good but the Hollywood copy looks like Imraha Juhaj and Mohana Krishna's camera work is excellent
 parvaiz shaikh or jasmit hin kii lekhnee par ection haaavee hota he
 The editing of Amitabh Shukla is good but overall 'force 2' seems to be an imitation of Hollywood action packed films

 After this, there is a discussion that now Salman's film will be released on Eid 2020
 spotboy ne bollywood hangaamaa ke hawaale se likhaa- salmaan khan ne duusari ection thriller film 'radhe' sin kar lee he
 This film will be an adaptation of the Korean movie, not a remake
 ye kaunsi korean film he iske bare main abhi khulaasa nahin hua he
 Please tell that Salman Khan's film Bharat was also a remake of Korean film
 film ne box offis par shandaar pradarshan diya
 According to the source of Bollywood Hungama, Radhe will come after Dabangg 3
 ye film 2020 main id par relies hogi
 Dabangg 3 is releasing on 20 December 2019
 dabang 3 kii relies se pehle salmaan radhe kaa kuch hissaa shoot bhi kar lenge
 Prabhudeva will also direct Radhe

 Prabhudheva and Salman Khan are giving the script a final touch
 bataa den ki isse pehle salmaan khan film kii tere naam or wonted main unke kirdaar kaa naam radhe tha
 Both films proved to be super hit at the box office
 dabang 3 kii baat karen to film main salmaan khan ke alaava sonakshi sinha or sai manjrekar bhi ahm role main hai
 There is a lot of buzz about the film
