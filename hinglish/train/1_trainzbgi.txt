 com / jdhqp0lrrx — Imran Khan (@imrankhanpti) December 19, 2019 He wrote this non-fiction book in 2003
 mrityu ke paanch saal baad kolemanist, jarnlist or lekhak khushvanth singh ek baar phir charchaa main hai
 This discussion is happening because of one of his most controversial books
 unhone 2003 main gujarat dangon ke ek saal baad ye kitaab likhi thi
 This book was published by Penguin Books
 apni kitaab ke avlokan main unhone likhaa he ki mujhe laga ki jaise raashtra khatme kii ore bad rahaa he
 Half a century ago, the country became witness to partition violence
 itane dinon main desh main bahut kuch behatar ho saktaa tha, lekin lag rahaa he ki isse or bura shaayad abhi hona baaki he
 In his book, he has also cited all the incidents of race, religion and ethnic violence in the country and the world
 kitaab main unhone likhaa he ki puri tarah se sambhaavna he ki bharat bhavishya main pehle jaisaa ho jayega
 This book of his was very much discussed
 unhone kitaab main 2002 main gujarat main sampradayik hinsa ke vishleshan se lekar 1984 ke sikh virdohi dange, graham stance or unke bacchon ko jalaana, punjab or kashmir main aatankwaadiyon dwaara lakshith hatya ke bare main likhaa he
 Khushwant Singh is forced to think about the complete corruption of religion
 wo kehete hai ki isi ne hamen hamen prithvi par sabase krur logon main shaamil kiya he
 He also says that fundamentalism has less to do with politics than religion
 unhone kitaab main sampradayik raajnneeti par bhi likhaa he
 It is said that we have chosen them, nurtured them, and given ourselves to them
 unhone kashmir or purvottar main vidroh, bihar main jati yuddh, bikhare hue naksali andolan, or alpsankhyakon kaa yahudee bodh ko is baat kaa pramaan mana he ki jaateey, kshetreey or nasleey pahchaan ke hamaare junun ne desh ko peeche chhod diya he, itnaa peeche ki use waapas na laayaa ja sake
 At the moment, disputes have deepened once again regarding this book
 jis vakt ye kitaab prakashit hui thi, kai sanghathanon ne iskaa baari virodh kiya tha
 Let us know that many celebrities and people from the enlightened class are writing on social media in the episode of protests going on all over the country about the Citizenship Amendment Bill

 The first phase election was going on at that time and the entire BJP including PM Modi made it an issue
 jisase congress baikfoot par aa gai thi
 Mani Shankar Aiyar has also troubled the party earlier due to his statements
 saal 2014 chunaav se pehle ayyar ne hi sabase narendra modi ke liye 'chywala' shabd kaa istemaal kiya tha or unke is bayaan kaa bijepi ne puure chunaav main khub bhunaaya tha

 PM Kisan Samman Yojana has also been cited in the petition
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki yah yojanaayen free and fere ellection kaa ulanghan he kyonki matadaataaon ko lubhaane liye yah yojanaayen laai jaati hai
 The petition states that this is similar to the practice of corruption under the Representation of the People Act

 Ajay Devgn has been a part of almost all his films including Prakash Jha's latest film 'rajneeti' and according to Jha he enjoys working with this National Award winning actor as he fits into every character
 jha ne kaha ‘sach main ajay ke saath mujhe or mere saath unhen kaam karne main majaa aata he
 He is not only a great professional but also a good person and this is what sets him apart from others
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘ham donon ke bich ek duusare ke liye behatar samaj he
 He can do anything
 koi aashcharya nahin jab main film likh rahaa hota hum to uske ek yaa do kirdaar aise hote hai, jinamein ajay ekadam feet baithte hai
 Since 1999, Jha and Devgan have worked together in a total of four films - 'dil Kya Kare' (1999), 'gangajal' (2003), 'kidnapping' (2005) and 'rajneeti' (2010)
 is dauraan jha ne sirf ek film ‘rahul’ (2001) main devgan ko nahin liya
 Jha gave a new face to Rahul and the film was financed at the box office
 ‘gangaajal’ or ‘apharan’ charchit hone ke saath-saath vyavsaayik rup se bhi safal raheen
 This is the reason why Jha kept a special place for Ajay Devgan despite the inclusion of many old actors in 'politics'
 film main nasiruddin shah or naanaa patekar jaise manze hue abhinaytaon ke saath ranvir kapur or katrina caff jaise ubharate sitare bhi hai
 Jha said, 'I talked to Ajay about politics in 2005 itself, the days when we were busy in the kidnapping
 kahani kii ruparekha mere dimag main tabhi se thi, jise baad main maine aakaar diya
 It is being told that Jha is trying to take Amitabh Bachchan in his upcoming film 'reservation', but Devgan has also been confirmed in that
 apni ab tak kii sabase mahangi film ‘raajnneeti’ ke bare main jha ko ummid he ki yah film box aphis par safal hogi
 He says, 'when a film does well, everyone benefits from it
 raajnneeti main kai achche kalakaar hai isliye logon ko usase kaaphi ummiden bhi hai
 Asked if the film will not run in the name of Prakash Jha, Jha said, 'no it will not be appropriate

 The GSAT-12 satellite with 12 transponders of high capacity has a lifespan of about eight years
 pieselvi ke saath isapar kareeb 200 karod rupee kaa kharch aayaa he
 It is expected that this will help the country overcome the shortage of transponders

 After the launch of GSAT-12, India will have 175 transponders but is still behind isro's target of 500 transponders by 2012 which will help it to meet the growing demands in telecom, direct to home and V-SAT operations 
 safal prakshepan se prafullit najar aa rahe isro ke adhyaksh ke radhakrishnan ne isaki ghoshnaa karte hue kaha, ‘mujhe yah bataate hue kaaphi khushi ho rahi he ki pieselvi-si17 jisat-12 abhiyaan safal rahaa

 ISRO Chairman Radhakrishnan said that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has congratulated the entire team of ISRO for the successful launch of GSAT-12
 radhakrishnan ne kaha ki aane vaale maheene main isro pieselvi ke kai mishnon ko aage badhaayegaa or kai upgrahon kaa prakshepan karegaa
 At the same time, while congratulating ISRO on this achievement, Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office v Narayanasamy said that it will help the country to meet the need of more transponders
 jisat-12 ko prithvi ke sabase kareebi bindu 284 kilometre or sabase dur ke bindu 21 hajaar kilometre ke dirghavritakar sthanantaran kaksha main bheja gaya he
 Similarly, the liquid remote motor satellite (LAMS) placed in the vehicle will be used to place it in a circular orbit
 jisat kaa uddeshy insat pranali kii kshamta ko majboot bananaa he taaki duurastha shiksha, duurastha chikitsa or gram sansaadhan centre ko unnat banaaya ja sake

 According to an American agency, a 14-year-old minor girl at that time had a dispute with her parents about something
 ladki ko itnaa gussa aayaa ki wo apana ghar chhodkar bhaag nikali
 During this time she got caught in the clutches of a racket of human trafficking
 use taskaron ne ek hotel main bandhak bana liya
 And then the process of sexual exploitation of the girl began to end
 us hotel main ghante ke hisaab se graahak aate the or naaballig ladki ke saath jabaran sambandh banaakar chale jate
 Surprisingly, people associated with this business used to contact customers through social media and advertising
 hotel kaa maalik bhi is racket se judaa hua tha
 When that girl got free from the clutches of these poor people and reached the police, the policemen were also surprised to hear her story
 ladki ne apane bayaan main daawa kiya ki do saal ke dauraan kareeb 1000 se zyada logon ne uske saath shaareerik sambadh banaae
 Giving information in the court, the victim's lawyer Nadeem Bezar said that the hotel owner and the staff there used to exploit the girl by giving room to the human smugglers on rent
 graahakon ko kamare kiraye par dene kaa jhooth bolkar unke kamare main naaballig ladakiyon ko shaareerik sambandh banane ke liye bheja jaataa tha
 It is said that many girls have become victims of this racket

 yah sab bahut tej gati se karne kii jarurat he or unki safalataa is baat par nirbhar karegi ki ve pradhanmantri kii priy pariyojna, mek in india par kis tarah amal karte hai
 According to rough estimates, India is going to spend more than $ 260 billion on military purchases in the next 12 years
 ancert and yang ke raksha or airospes vibhaag kii report kaa kahana he ki sarkaar agar mek in india model par amal kar saki to kam-se-kam 50 arab dollar kii bachat kii ja sakegi
 Thus most of the major projects in the new government that are being described as 'approved' are those in Make in India — from next generation submarines and light helicopters for the military to transport aircraft, howitzers for the Air Force, howitzers and water and land
 To combat ships working on
 ye sabhi yojanaayen 1 lakh karod ru
 Has more than is samay prakriya ke vibhinn charnon se guzar raheen aapurti kii kul 21 badi pariyojnaon main se kam-se-kam 18 pariyojnaayen bharat main hi nirmit hone vaali hai
 These do not include the deal of billions of dollars worth of fighter jets
 sarkaar raksha utpaadan main nijee companiyon ko badhaava dena chaahati he
 Minister of State in-charge of defense production Rao Inderjit Singh told India Today, "to achieve our target of indigenization, private industry will have to come forward
 saarvajanik kshetra kii apni bhoomika he, lekin kai dashak ke anubhav ke baad yah saaf he ki nijee companiyon ko kadam badhaane honge
 While the initial response from the private industry has been encouraging, after realizing the practical hurdles, it seems that Make in India is a long way, which will require drastic decisions
 misaal ke taur par nijee kshetra ke liye mek in india kii pehali or sabase badi pariyojna ko hi len: vaayu sena kii ore se apane 56 evaro medium lift transport vimaan ke bede ko badalane kii yojana
 The Indian Air Force wanted a private company to enter into an agreement with a foreign vendor and pay Rs 13,000 crore to India
 kii pariyojna ke tahat ek utpaadan kaarkaana sthapit kare
 But despite repeated negotiations between Indian and foreign companies, only one joint venture came forward — the airbus-tata alliance
 raksha aapurti par apni pehali baithak main parrikar ne is faisle ko philhal taal diya he ki single-vendor sthiti ko aage badhaayaa jaae yaa phir se tender diya jaae
 If the second option was adopted, it would obviously be delayed
 nijee kshetra ko pehle se sthapit saarvajanik kshetra kii companiyon (piesu) se bhi muqabla karnaa hoga, jinhone varshon se apana buniyadi dhaancha taiyaar kar rakhaa he
 It is almost impossible for private companies to compete with psus in terms of prices, as private companies will have to reinvent their feet
 unhen badi sankhya main logon kii bhartee kerani hogi or takanic hasil kerani hogi—jis par baari laagat aegi
 If the private sector starts production and enters the export market, it will have to face the dual challenges of accountability and certification
 pradarshan na kar paane yaa kharaab pradarshan kii javabdehi bhartiya company par hogi, kyonki vahi sena ko apana saamaan bechegi or baari rakam ke saudon ko dekhte hue zyaadaatar companiyon ke liye ise hasil karnaa mushkil hoga
 In addition, it will be difficult for the private sector to get certification of its products
 in utpaadon ke liye aisa antarrashtriya pramaan hasil karnaa hoga, jo quality control kii guarantee dete hai
 These proofs are mandatory for all military deals
 pramanikaran kii prakriya lambii or kathin hoti he
 It takes years to register each part
 pilatas aircraft limited vaayu sena ko basic train vimaan muhaiyaa karaati he
 The company has been searching for an Indian partner for many years with whom it can produce 106 aircraft according to the demand of the Air Force
 philhal talash jari he
 Jim Roach, deputy CEO of Pilatus Aircraft, said, "there is not a single company in India that can manufacture aircraft, get its certificate and deliver aircraft to the Air Force in a stipulated time
" udaan suraksha pramanikaran ke saath hi shuru hoti he or bharat main aisi ek bhi commercial company nahin he jiske paas pramanikaran ke puure upaay hai
 "while the biggest demand from the private sector is that it wants facilities similar to psus in terms of taxes and various charges for business, the Department of Defense Production is currently reviewing industry recommendations to find a solution
" 
 nijee udyogon ne mantralay se yah bhi nivedan kiya he ki vah chote-chote muddon par companiyon ko kaali suchi main na daale
 Private industry is demanding from the government to revive the Make in India scheme, in which the government will provide financial assistance of 80 per cent of the cost of the new project
 yah nai pariyojna agali peedi ke infentry ladaaku vaahan banane kii he, jise raksha utpaadan main 10 saal kaa jaruri anubhav rakhane vaali companiyon ne pesh kiya he
 But Parrikar has to end the tussle between the already established players like Tata and Larsen & Toubro and new companies like Reliance Aerospace
 reliance airospes raksha utpaadan main anubhav kii avadhi ghataakar paanch saal karne kii maang kar rahi he
 Although the Army agrees on the plan for indigenization, it fears that blindly adopting a make-in-india policy in case of every purchase may prove suicidal for modernization
 bhartiya nausena, jiske paas aatmanirbharta kaa pramanit record he, chetavanee detii he ki swadeshi utpaadan kai staron vaali pariyojna he, jisamen dhairya or samay kii jarurat he
 Chief of the Navy Admiral R
 ke
 Dhawan told India Today, "the Navy already had the vision and it started 50 years ago
 ab puri kadi kaam kar rahi he
 Manufacturers need to understand that this is a long process and they should also be ready to suffer losses
 unhen is baat ke liye bhi taiyaar rahanaa chahie ki unhen na sirf nirmaan karnaa he, balki apane utpaadanon kaa unke kaam karne tak rakh-rakhaav bhi karnaa hoga
 This is a big challenge
 ''darasal parrikar se us footbal khilaadi jaisi ummid kii ja rahi he, jise bich khel main aise vakt main maidan par utaara gaya he jab team gol main pichad rahi he
 He is expected to start scoring goals before the warm-up
 haalanki yah ummid jarurat se thodi zyada lagati he, lekin asaliyat main halaat muravvat karne jaise dikh nahin rahe hai
 In such a situation, if the bubble of Make in India explodes, then the result could certainly prove to be dangerous for the military forces
 padosi pakistan or china ke saath pehle se jari tanaavpurv sambandhon ko dekhte hue bharat ke paas phir se taiyaari karne or qamar kasne kaa kaa samay nahin rahegaa
 It is to be seen how Parrikar is able to balance

 Sneha Shekhawat, a daughter of the Shekhawati zone of Rajasthan, was leading the Air Force contingent at this biggest function in the country at Rajpath at India Gate in Delhi
 unhone raashtrapati ke naate teenon senaaon kii pramukh or shekhavati kii hi beti pratibha devisingh patil ko salaami di
 On this special occasion, she became the first woman military officer in the country to lead an army contingent
 sanyog dekhie ki sarvshereshth parade daste kaa khitaab bhi vaayu sena ko hi mila
 This incident was pointing to the rapid change in Shekhawati women at the level of thinking
 ek tarah se isane shekhavati kii un saahsee yuvatiyon ke iraadon ko bal hi diya jo desh kii sarvocch sainya ikai main aana chaahati hai
 Let's try to catch the trend strings
 isaki shuruyaat kaagaj ke ek tukade se hui
 It is 1992
 28 april, 1986 ko janmi sneha kii umr us vakt 7 saal thi
 She started making and flying ships with pieces of paper
 ghar vaale use aisa baar-baar karte dekhte
 But he did not even think that this girl will one day create a history on Rajpath
 bachapan ke khel ke unheen kuch lamhon main is nanhee bitiyaa ke dilo-dimag main payalat banane kaa sapana baith gaya
 She now laughs when reminded of those days
 paariwarik maahaul ne bhi unke sapanom ko hawa dene main koi kasar na chodi
 In Gujarat Raj Bhavan, both Under Secretary Mahavir Singh Shekhawat and his wife Jagriti were willing to do anything for their daughter
 gujarat main schuli shiksha ke baad bi

 kii padhai unhone rajasthan main hi jodhpur se kii
 He took one and a half year training in Hyderabad after crossing the path of exams / interviews required for his entry into the Air Force
 aaj ve vaayu sena ke ladaaku jahaaj uda rahi hai
 In his words, 'my biggest dream was to become a pilot, which was finally fulfilled
 ' shekhavati ke sikar jile ke hardaspur gaanv kii sneha kii saathi payalat saurabh se ankhen chaar huin or 2010 main donon ne ek-duusare ke gale main maala daal di
 She was not the only young woman from Shekhawati to have such a dream
 bisiyon or is raste par chalane kii taiyaari kar rahi thim
 Among those who won, Veena Saharan is also there
 aaj ve iel-76 naam kaa jahaaj uda rahi hai
 Not only this, she is the first woman pilot in the country to fly this aircraft
 isse pehle is jahaaj ko purush payalat hi udaaya karte the
 The reason is also: The IL-76 weighs 190 tons and is the largest ship in the country in terms of traffic
 yuddh or aapadaa jaisi sthitiyon main yah vaayu sena kaa sabase upyogi vaahan he
 The initiative to command the ship in the hands of women pilots was a major step in the history of the Indian Air Force
 veena yah jimmedaari uthaane ke liye lagaataar dastak detii aa rahi thim
 He earlier proved his worth by flying a ship named AN-32
 is jahaaj se ve desh ke durgam sainya sthalon par rashan or duusari jaruri chijen pahunchaati thim
 She kept flying with full efficiency and courage in the inaccessible areas of hilly regions like Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh
 bukamp, baadh or sunami jaisi aapadaaon par unhen jaruri jimmedaariyaan saunpane main vaayu sena ke adhikariyon ko sankoch na hua
 He was finally given the command of IL-76 in 2009 after being confident of his ability
 philhal chandigarh main tainaat squadran leader veena ab bhi is jahaaj ko udaane vaali ekmaatr mahila payalat hai
 She has also flown Air Force HPT-32 and DO 228 ships

 His father Hari Singh was a colonel in the Saharan army
 taaoo or naanaa bhi bhi faujee the
 In this way the house had a military atmosphere
 12 june, 1981 ko janmi veena kii schuli shiksha pita kii posting ke hisaab se kai jagahon par hui
 Especially Delhi, Jaipur and Bikaner
 yah vigyaan snaatak chaatra 2001 main physics main dilli uniwarsity top kar gai
 Before the results of the graduation exam came, the service selection board (SSB) selected Veena
 das saal kii naukari main teen tarakkee paa chuki veena kii maane to sena kii naukari ladakiyon ke hisaab se sabase acchhee he
 In his words, 'look, girls, whether in the city or in the village, have talent
 jarurat bas parijanon se thodaa-sa protsaahan milane kii hoti he
 'and the joy of flying dreams come true? 'that's not a big deal
 ek disha main eemaandaaree se mehnat ke saath lage rahen to kamyaabi milani hi he
 In 2010, Veena married Captain Tarun Singh of the Army
 yani baaki jindagi bhi sainya maahaul main hi kategi
 It is not that the approach of all the girls of Shekhawati towards the army has been so easy
 26 saal kii anju mile ko hi lijie
 In 2009, Anju of Lalasi village of Sikar joined the army as a lieutenant
 agle hi saal tarakkee paakar aaj ve captain hai
 Ramapratap Meal, retired as Inspector in CRPF and Anju, daughter of housewife mother Bhanwari Devi, was challenged to be in the army by staying in a typical village
 lekin bachapan kaa sapana unhen usee ore khinch rahaa tha
 Anju, a science graduate from Jaipur, often topped athletics events during schooling
 unki kad-lathi sainikon jaisi thi hi
 Then what was there! He started trying his best in the army exams
 2009 main unhen manzil mil gai
 Of the three siblings, Majhali Anju got the most help from his elder sister Manju
 'di ne mujhe kabhi niraash nahin hone diya
 She stood as an inspiration to me at every turn
 ' do maheene pehle hi ek beemaa company main kaam karne vaale anil sunda se unka rishta ho gaya he
 Anju is posted in Sainik Hospital in Jaipur
 anchal ke log bhi ab yahaan kii ladakiyon ke kadamon tale se aati aahat ko mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Listen to Jeram, who is a major in the army, 'the number of troops in Shekhawati is already very good
 ritair faujee to rahete hi hai, abhi jo hai ve bhi chhuttiyon main jab aate hai to ghar par fouj ke hi kisse-kahaniyaan sunai jaati hai
 This has also increased curiosity about the army of the house's ends
 ' ve kehete hai ki sena ke tamaam padon ke liye bhartiyon kii khabar sabase pehle isi ilaake main failati he
 The sheer height of Shekhawati girls is now challenging the Chhotis of the neighboring district as well
 sikar se sate nagaur jile ke deedwanaa ke chote gaanv bhavadia kii 27 varshiya deepika rathod ne is chunauti ko sweekaar bhi kiya he
 Deepika had a childhood like normal girls
 lekin netritv karnaa unki fitrat main tha
 After schooling in Jaipur, she graduated from Bhavani Niketan Women's College
 ve vahiin chatraasang kii adhyaksh baniin
 Then her attention turned to NCC and she joined it
 ensisi main rahete hue deepika ne mount everest par bhi chadhaai kii
 The thrill and discipline of NCC days weaved dreams of going into the army for Deepika
 mehnat or lagan kii vajah se deepika ko ensisi kii awwal cadet kaa award bhi mila
 This award removed the further confusion for him
 esasabi kaa imtahaan diya or 2008 main sena main leftinent ke pad par ja lageen
 Became a captain in 2010 after being promoted
 deepika ko nrity kaa shauk shuru se rahaa he
 During school-college days, he had perfected his dancing skills
 pichley saal marchent navy ke ejeeniyar jitendra singh shekhavat se unki shaadi ho gai
 Deepika's father Ganpat Singh Rathore is a deputy director in the Rajasthan Finance Commission and mother Santosh Kanwar is a housewife, who has a special attachment to her village Bhavadia
 pita ke shabdon main, 'deepika kaa atitude bachapan se hi aam ladakiyon se alag tha
 And after joining NCC, it got new wings
 ' 1984 main janmin deepika aaj apana sapana puraa hone se khush hai
 Like Veena, she also advocates for army jobs for girls
 iske alaava, gaanv kii ladakiyon ke saamne aane vaali mushkilon kii ore ve ishaara karti hai, 'parijanon ko ghar kii ladki kii kshamtaaon ko dekhte hue uske anuroop ghar kaa maahaul taiyaar karnaa chahie
 But directionless education, curb their independence and negative thinking clothe these girls' feet like fetters
 ' deepika ek baar phir mount everest ke liye ravaanaa ho rahi hai
 To hoist the flag on Everest, an army team has been formed, in which the Chief of Army Staff has selected seven women soldiers
 un mahila phogiyon main jaipur kii major neha bhatnagar bhi hai
 This is the second ever visit by female soldiers on Everest
 isse pehle 2005 main ek dal bheja gaya tha
 The team will leave on 22 March and will return on 2 June
 yahaan bataa den ki deepika kii bahan ruchika bhi college main ensisi se judi hui hai or haal hi unhone sena kii naukari kii pariksha bhi di he
 The girls of Shekhawati, who had claimed the top position in health and education jobs in the state, are now trying their best in a challenging field like the Army
 yah haal ke varshon kaa ghatnakram he
 The big reason behind this is the desire to do something new
 shekhavati kshetra ke shiksha main aage hone kii vajah se kuch nayaa hone kaa maahaul apane aap taiyaar ho gaya
 There are many such villages in the state where only a few are employed in government jobs
 aise gaanvon ke liye sarkari naukari badi baat he, vah koi bhi ho
 But there are door-to-door government servants in Shekhawati zone
 shiksha or swasthya vibhaag main to anginat
 The boys still dominated the army
 shaayad is tathy ne bhi yahaan kii ladakiyon ko damakham or dabangai vaali faujee naukari ke liye prerit kiya
 Although no such data is available, the trend has increased in the last five years
 sena bhi in ladakiyon kaa dikh kholkar swaagat kar rahi he
 Sneha says, 'there is no such thing as discrimination between men and women in the army
 aisa hota to main rajpath par salaami parade kii aguai karne vaali desh kii pehali mahila sainya adhikari na ban paati
 'she gives a very effective formula for the girls of the village:' They should leave all hesitation and hesitation and leave the house with the belief that i can do everything

 Apart from just standing on the roof and shouting, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) officials and the government have left no stone unturned to see their feud against each other clearly
 jo ankaha tha vah bhi kaha ja chukaa he
 No words were pressed
 apratyaashit ho chukaa he or koi bhi shaayad yah nahin jaanata ki aage kya hoga
 Uncertainty is making markets and industries impatient
 rigerv bank or kendriya mantri apane number badhaane ke liye saarvajanik manchon kaa sahaara lene lage hai
 Reserve Bank Deputy Governor Viral Acharya made a scathing attack in a lecture on October 26, stating, "countries which do not respect the independence of the central bank will be victimized by the wrath of financial markets, if not today
" Fire will erupt and one day it will come when they regret that they have hollowed out an important institution
 duusari taraf, unke samajhadaar samakaksh, jo kendriya bank kii swatantraaa main bharosa karenge, saste karj hasil kar sakenge, unhen antarrashtriya niveshkon kaa pyaar milegaa or unka jeevankaal lanbaa hoga
 The echo of his remarks echoed throughout the markets and corridors of power
 bharat main nivesh karne ke bare main videshi niveshkon ko salaah dene vaale ek macro iconomist afsos jataate hue kehete hai, ''rigerv bank or north block ke bich asantosh kareeb ek saal se sulag rahaa tha, lekin viral ke bhaashan ne samoochee tasviir badal di
 "A minister in the Modi government, who does not want his name to be mentioned, is deeply irritated by the attitude of the Reserve Bank
" prekshkon kaa kahana he ki vaise to sarkaar kii do niti niamak sansthaaon ke bich pehle se kaaphi tanaav tha, lekin is haalat tak maamle kaa pahunchnaa asal main pichley ek saal main kai nitigat nirnyon ke maamle main rigerv bank par lagaataar bane dabaav kii vajah se hua he
 The crisis in the non-banking financial services sector made the situation worse
 infrastracchar sector ko karj dene vaali diggaj company infrastracchar lijing and financial services (ielandeeyes) ke difolt hone se bharat kaa lagaataar badhata shadow banking sector sabaki najar main aa gaya or is baat kii ashanka vaastavik lagane lagi ki arthvyavastha ko pangu karne vaala karj sankat aa saktaa he
 Due to shrinking sources of debt, the anxiety of big businessmen and small and medium entrepreneurs increased
 vastav main shaayad esemai sector ke hiton ko aage badhaane ke liye hi swadeshi arthshaastri es
 Gurumurthy was made a director on the board of the Reserve Bank and Nachiketa Mor's term on the board was reduced
 ielandeeyes sankat ke liye sarkaar ko jimmedaar mana gaya or rupye main giravat se vipaksh ko sarkaar par hamale ke liye paryaapt eendhan mil gaya
 The government said that RBI should have done better monitoring in both the cases
 isliye koi achraj kii baat nahin thi ki vitt mantri arun jetali ne acharya kii tippanee kaa jawaab diya or rigerv bank kii is baat ke liye aalochana kii ki vah atishay karj vitaran ko rokane main naakaam rahaa
 He said, "between 2008 and 2014, when banks were giving indiscriminate loans, the central bank ignored it
 ''yah koi pehali baar nahin tha ki vitt mantri ne niamakon kii javabdehi kaa maamla uthaaya ho
 In February this year, Jaitley said, "ultimately, the rules of the game are for the regulators to decide and the regulators have to keep their third eye always open
 lekin durbhaagya se bhartiya vyavastha main ham raajnneetikon ko javabdeh banaaya gaya he, niamakon ko nahin
 After this, in a speech on 14 March, Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel responded to this charge
 unhone kaha, ''aarope-pratyarope or apni topi uske sir karnaa to chalata hi rahata he, khaskar alpakaalik or bina sochi-samajhi pratikriyaaon main
 It seems that due to this uproar, all the participants are not able to deepen and deepen their metaphysics
 '' ve bainkon ke swaamitv jaise mahatvapurn masale par apni baat rakh rahe the, jo ki sarkaar or kendriya bank ke bich takaraav kaa pehla kshetra tha
 He said that all commercial banks are regulated by the Reserve Bank but all public banks are regulated by the government and the Reserve Bank also has no authority in terms of corporate governance of public banks
 isi masale ko acharya ne bhaashan main uthaaya tha
 The second point of contention is the transfer of treasury
 sarkaar ne yah seemaa tay kar rakhi he ki rigerv bank ke paas 3
 6 lakh crore Rs
 tak kii hi atirikt puunji rah sakati he or vah chaahati he ki yah sarplus ke rup main rahe
 But Acharya once again refutes this demand
 ve kehete hai, ''kendriya bank ke kaamkaaj se ho sakane vaale kisi tarah ke ghate ko sahane ke liye paryaapt dhan uplabdh hona or munaafe ko sahi jagah lagane ke liye paryaapt niyamon kaa hona, kendriya bank ko sarkaar se swatantra rahane ke liye mahatvapurn he
 He cited the talk of Rakesh Mohan, former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank, for the need of a strong bookkeeping of the central bank
 rakesh mohan ne kaha tha, ''rigerv bank kii puunji par chhapamari karne se sarkaar ko shuddh rup se dekhen to koi nayaa rajasav nahin hasil hoga or isse alp avadhi main mukt puunji ko lekar bhram hi banegaa
 The use of such a transfer will only erode the trust that remains with the government's intentions in terms of showing financial prudence
 ''teesraa masalaa, niamak ke kaaryakshetra kaa he
 The government is insisting on a separate regulator for payments, but the Reserve Bank argues that the payment system is actually a sub-set of currency that RBI regulates
 uskaa tark he ki pement regulatory board kaa gathan vitt mantri ke jariye vitt vidheyak main kii gai ghoshnaaon ke anuroop nahin he
 The final issue of confrontation is the NBFC crisis
 vaise to sarkaar or rigerv bank, donon is baat par jor dete rahe hai ki nakadi pravaah ko lekar chintaa kii koi baat nahin he, lekin masalaa yah he ki nakadi sahi logon ke haath main jaani chahie
 The market is demanding a separate window for refinancing of nbfcs, while the Reserve Bank is determined not to provide any relief to companies that have taken indiscriminate loans
 care retings ke mukhya arthshaastri madan sabanvis kehete hai, ''jahaan tak enbiensi ke liye alag windo kholane kii baat he, aise to har sector apane liye alag windo kii maang karegaa
 These will all become a parable
 sankat ko hal karne or kisi bich ke raste par pahunchane ke liye baatcheet hi sabase acha tarika he
 For example, in the context of Immediate Corrective Action (PCA), you may want banks to lend only to companies with AAA ratings
 '' pisie vaale bainkon main nae lone dene, shakhaon ke vistaar yaa nae karmchaariyon kii bhartee par roak laga di jaati he, jo ki rigerv bank or sarkaar ke bich takaraav kaa ek or masalaa ban gaya he
 Another issue of dispute is the Reserve Bank circular issued in February this year stating that any company which delays even a day in repayment of loans, will be considered as a defaulter
 companiyaan iske khilaaf khadi ho gai hai
 The power companies have challenged this circular in the court and the Supreme Court has banned it, it has also stopped the introduction of insolvency action against the power companies running in trouble
 media main aisi khabaren hai ki governor urjit patel par istipha dene ke liye dabaav he
 But if he does, the natural result will be that his successor will have to run completely according to the government
 yadi ve pad par bane rahete hai to unhen nakadi pravaah or bharosa bahaali ke mahatvapurn masalon par tatkaal hi koi kadam uthaanaa hoga
 Most importantly, if Patel goes, there will be a perception that the Modi government is incapable of working with economists who hold a different world view

 ipies or opies dhadon ke aapas main vilay ke baad ummid kii ja rahi he ki chunaav ayog 6 aktubar ko annadramuk ke 'do pattee' chunaav chinh ke bhavishya ke bare main vichaar karegaa
 And the AIADMK General Council's decision to abolish the disputed post of party general secretary will come up for hearing in the High Court on 23 October
 magar sattarudh party kii mushkilen or zyada bad sakati hai
 The effective number of members of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly has declined to 19 (with the cancellation of membership of 18 mlas and the still vacant seat of Jayalalithaa)
 aise main annadramuk apane maujuuda 116 sadasyon ke dam par vidhansabha main shakti pareekshan jeet sakati he
 However, it is being said that at least 12 more members are against the EPS government, which could further reduce the aiadmk's majority
 yah ghatakar vipaksh ke 98 sadasyon (dramuk-89, congress-8 or aayiumail-1) ke baraabar aa saktaa he
 With this, politics can be seen at a new point
 manivannan kehete hai, ''annadramuk party dhire-dhire par pakke taur par bikhar rahi he
 Even if they remain divided among the factions, their escape will depend entirely on staying in power, not on the soul of Jayalalitha whom they cry throughout the day
 '' ve yah bhi kehete hai, ''siyaasi satta is sarkaar kaa akelaa jharokha he jiske jariye ise dilli kii bhaajapa sarkaar or soobe ke iske alambaradaaron kii teen-tikadamen jinda rakhe hai
 It is the puppet government that has left behind the legacy of Jayalalithaa and the mandate given to the AIADMK in May 2016 under her leadership
 ''ipies or opies ko rasta dikhaane vaale bhaajapa ke salaahkaaron ke paas annadramuk ko bachaane kaa akelaa tarika ab yah rah gaya he ki ve unhen party kaa chunaav chinh 'do pattee' hasil karne main madad karen
 This is the only way through which things might be alright for the EPS government until the next election, provided it remains
 haalanki centre main bhaajapa ke liye yah siyaasi jarurat he ki vah ipies sarkaar bani rahe, taaki annadramuk kaa sansad main use samarthan miltaa rahe
 Meanwhile, the DMK is openly demanding a strength test in the assembly
 iskaa akelaa makasad annadramuk kii durdasha ko saamne laana he
 She knows that the EPS government is in Delhi's Rahmokram and is gearing up for the mid-term elections, which could happen with the Lok Sabha elections due in 18 months from now
 manivannan kehete hai, ''dramuk ummid kar rahi he ki annadramuk kii belgaum dhadebandi uske haq main kaam karegi
 But this view undermines the bjp's strength to change the ground situation
 ''darasal, dramuk ko apana samarthan aadhaar banaae rakhane ke liye zyada kuch karne kii jarurat nahin he, haalanki vah choti-choti partiyon (2016 main haar ke antar 1
 More than 5 percent of the vote, they can contribute) is not allowed to erode
 isamen do raay nahin ki yahi vah jagah he jahaan camel hasan yaa rajnikant agar nai partiyaan banaate hai, to donon rajya kii raajnneeti main shaayad badi bhoomika adaa kar sakate hai
 The reason is that the factions separated from the aiadmk's vote bank can go to their court
 vaise, is ganit se dramuk ke rahanuma zyada pareshaan nahin hai
 They would like to preserve their strength of political bargain till the end
 beshak, party ke netaa yah chahenge ki 2ji ghotaale ke faisle kaa, jo 25 aktubar ko aane vaala he, koi pratikul asar vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle votaron kii yaaddaasht main dhundhala pad jaae, phir chunaav chaahe madhyavadhi hon yaa vidhansabha kii miyaad puri hone par hi hon
 Going to the medical store, we first see the expiry date written on the medicine we buy
 yahi aadat khaane-pine kaa saamaan kharidte vakt bhi apanaate hai par kya aap daawey ke saath ye kah sakati hai ki aap koi bhi aisa saamaan nahin istemaal karti hai jo expire ho chukaa ho ?hamame se zyaadaatar log har roj expire ho chuki takiya, brush, bra or duusari chizon kaa istemaal karte hai
 But the interesting thing is that we do not know that these things also expire with time
 1
 Pillow should be changed in six months, maybe you have ever thought that your pillow can also expire
 haalanki takiye kaa expire ho janaa usamen bhare fibre par nirbhar karata he
 a pillow made of light quality fiber is replaceable in six months
 haalanki achche fedar or oon se bana takiya aath saal tak bhi chalata he
 Perhaps you will always see your pillow right, but after some time it gets filled with dust, dirt, oil, hair
 saath hi iskaa aakaar bhi badal jaataa he
 Sleeping on a very thin pillow causes neck pain
 2
 When to change toothbrushes There are many people who do not change their brushes until their bristles begin to fall and fall
 par dhire-dhire brush ke bristles kharaab hone shuru ho jate hai
 Due to which neither teeth are cleaned properly and other gums also get hurt
 exparts maanate hai ki 30 din ke bheetar brush badal lenaa chahie
 Also, to keep the brush in good condition, after brushing it should be washed with warm water so that the food portals trapped in it get out and the bacteria does not come up
 3
 Should be changed in eight months How old or how old is your favorite bra? You must be proudly telling your friends that this is my favorite bra that i have been wearing for so many years
 par kya aap jaanati he ki aapaki bra bhi expire hoti he? kuch maheenon baad aap bhi feel karti hongi ki aapaki bra kaa shape pehle kii tarah nahin rah gaya he or wo dhili ho gai he
 Wearing such a bra is not good, it can worsen shap
 4
 Kitchen sponges should be changed every week
 When do you change your kitchen sponge? Experts believe that the sponges used in the kitchen should be replaced every week
 zyada dinon tak istemaal hone vaale spanj main bacteria panpane lagate hai, jisase safai hone ke bajaay bimaariyaan hi failati he
 5

 At that time the speed of the plane was seven hundred kilometers per hour
 isi raftaar se wo 38 hajaar feet kii oonchai se neeche aa rahaa tha
 But in such a way that neither the plane was getting jolted nor the passengers had any doubt
 cockpit ke baahar maujuud main payalat ko baat samaj main aa gai thi kiplene teji se neeche ja rahaa he
 Only 11 minutes were met by co-pilot André Lubitz, and in these 11 minutes he controlled the plane so that his passengers with 150 passengers blew up
 vimaan ke blike box kii jaanch puri hone ke baad german adhikariyon ne pehali baar vimaan ke andar aakhri 11 minute kii baatcheet or aakhri 11 minute kii puri kahani jari kii he
 From this conversation it was revealed for the first time that when the Germanwings plane hit the mountain of Elpas with 150 passengers, it had a speed of 700 kilometers per hour
 blike baks kii kuch aawaaj or chikhen to raugate khadey kar dene vaali hai
 Especially the last five minutes
 wo aakhri paanch minute jab musafiron ko khidakiyon ke baahar dekhne ke baad ahsaas hua ki vimaan teji se neeche kii taraf ja rahaa he
 After this, only the sound of screaming started echoing in the whole plane and this sound came to a halt when the right wing of the aircraft first hit the mountain of the Alpus and a loud bang came
 barsilona se ude vimaan ko ab tak do ghante ho chuke the
 The plane was on time and was to land on its floor half an hour later
 kuch der pehle hi payalat captain patric ye ghoshnaa bhi kar chukaa tha ki vimaan kis oonchai par ud rahaa he or aage mausam kaisaa he? ab bas kuch der baad landing kii taiyaari kerani thi
 10:29 Main pilot Captain Patrick wakes up to go to the toilet before Mintlanding
 vimaan abhi auto payalat mod par tha
 Captain Patrick hands over the charge to his co-pilot Andrés before leaving the cockpit and exits the cockpit to go to the washroom
 10:30 mintepayalat ke baahar nikalate hi andraej fouran cockpit kaa darwaja andar se menuali lock kar detaa he
 After this, the auto-pilot mode changes to bring the aircraft from 38 thousand feet straight to an altitude of 100 feet
 isse vimaan achaanak nahin balki ek tay raftaar se neeche aane lagati he or musafiron ko jhatka bhi nahin lagata
 10:31 min Air traffic control tries to contact the airplane when the airbus comes down fast
 fouran sandesh detii he
 But there is no response from the cockpit
 10:32 mintepayalat captain patric ko washroom main hi andaja ho jaataa he ki vimaan neeche kii taraf ja rahaa he
 He immediately comes out and enters the password to open the cockpit door
 magar hairanjeg taur par darwaja nahin khulata
 The pilot then knocks on the door
 par andar se koi aawaaj nahin aati
 10:33 minnow the pilot is afraid of something untoward for the first time and starts banging the door loudly in disgrace
 par andar se ab bhi koi aawaaj nahin aati
 10:34 min Now the rest of the crew members of the plane also reach the cockpit
 sabhi ko-payalat ko aawaaj dete hai
 But there is still silence inside
 10:35 mintepayalat or kru members ko cockpit kaa darwaja peetate or cheekhte-chillaate dekh ab pehali baar musafiron ko sachai pataa chalati he
 The truth is that the co-palat has closed the door from inside and the plane is rapidly moving downwards
 puure vimaan main dehshat fail jaati he or har musafir rone-cheekhney lagata he
 Six minutes had passed by now
 magar naa to cockpit kaa darwaja khulaa or naa hi plane kaa neeche janaa rukaa
 But the worst that happened in these six minutes was that the passengers on board the aircraft now knew why the co-pilot was taking the plane down by closing the cockpit door
 10:36 minutemen payalat captain patric ab bhi lagaataar cockpit kaa darwaja khulwaane kii koshish kar rahe the
 Then his failed attempt was scaring the passengers more
 10:37 minatadarwaja peetane, khatkhatane or laat markar darwaja kholane kii jab tamaam koshish naakaam ho gai
 Captain Patrick hits the door with a metal, as the sound of loud hitting is being recorded
 ye shaayad cockpit main daakhil hone kii payalat captain patric kii aakhri koshish thi
 10:38 minutes 'tearn-pullup', the sound of an emergency alarm to stop an airplane going down, also stops now
 10:39 mintepayalat captain patric ek baar or cheekhte hue sunai dete hai
 He almost pleads with Andrés for his last request, 'please open the dam door'
 lekin unki is aakhri cheekh kaa bhi cockpit se koi jawaab nahin aata
 10:40 minutes This was the last watch of this ill-fated flight
 vimaan ke neeche aate hi alpus kii chotii se sabase pehle vimaan kaa dahinaa wing takaaraata he
 At a speed of seven hundred kilometers
 takkar hote hi wing ke chithde ud jate hai or phir plane kaa baaki hissaa bhi pahaad se ja takaraata he
 The collision was so terrible that the wreckage of the aircraft and the corpses torn to pieces disintegrate in a radius of about two kilometers
 is tarah payalat kii jagah kaman sanbhaalane ke thik 11wein minute main aadrej apni jaan samet 149 logon kii jaan le chukaa tha
 According to German investigative officers, the Black Box also shows that Andrzej Lubiz was provoking Pilot Patrick out of the cockpit late that day
 techoff ke baad hi jab vimaan ne apni tay oonchai pakad lee thi tabhi se wo baar-baar captain patric se kah rahaa tha ki wo jab chahen tab washroom ja sakate hai, wo kisi bhi vakt flite kaa control sanbhaalane ko taiyaar he
 On January 6, 2012, Andres was issued a pilot's license by the US Federation of Aviation Administration

 chini smartphone mekar oneplus ne kuch hi maheene pehle apana flagship smartphone oneplus 5 launch kiya tha
 In the review, it was described as the best Android smartphone of this segment
 company ne pichley saal flagship smartphone oneplus 3 ke baad doosraa vairient oneplus 3T launch kiya tha
 This time it was also expected that oneplus 5T will be launched
 lekin aisa nahin he
 According to reports, the company will now directly launch oneplus 6 in 2018
 khabaron ke mutabik 2018 kii shuruyaat main hi company apana flagship smartphone launch karegi
 What will happen in this smartphone is a big question
 chunki ab iske launch main kuch maheene kii bache hai, isliye internet par isse jude liks or reports aani shuru ho gayi hai
 What will be special in oneplus 6 and what will be its price in India, the company has already started working on oneplus 6, although the company has not officially said anything yet
 oneplus ne apane flagship oneplus 5 launch se hi oneplus 6 kii taiyaari shuru kar di thi
 At the moment it is not clear what will be special in it
 kyonki van plus ko isamen di jane vaali khaasiyaton ke bare main janaa jaataa he
 This time the company is working on a completely different design from oneplus 5 and oneplus 3T
 yani isamen ab age tu age disple hogi or bejal na ke baraabar hongi
 Currently, there is a trend to bring low-cost smartphones and there are companies like Apple and Samsung to Vivo
 isliye is baar age tu age disple milanaa tay he
 It will not be known which processor will be present
 lekin yah is par nirbhar karegaa kii agle saal qolkom koun sa procesar launch karegaa
 According to reports, the company will launch Snapdragon 845 next year, so this new processor can be used in oneplus 6
 is baar company ne do ram vairient vaale smartfones launch kiye hai
 One has 6GB RAM while the other has 8GB RAM
 isliye kya agle smartphone me 8GB se zyada ram hoga? yah bada sawaal he
 But more hope is that this time the company will launch both variants with 8GB RAM and its internal memory will be 128GB and 256GB
 chunki is baar company ne dual rier camera valasmartphone launch kiya he, isliye is baar bhi dual camera hona tay he
 However, this time there will be no surprise if two cameras are also given for selfies
 haalanki company is baar nayaa sensor yuj kar sakati he
 Prices have always been a plus point for oneplus, especially in India
 kyonki is segment ke duusare smartfones kii keemten kaaphi zyada hoti hai
 So this time also the company can be expected that its price in India will be less than 40 thousand

 The Prime Minister launched a new version of the National Human Rights website
 bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa naam agar aap china kii rajdhani beijing main kisi bhi adhikari ke saamne lenge to uske chehre par utsaah bhari muskaan khil uthegi
 The Chinese government sees some of its own qualities in India's new prime minister — a strong, decisive leader whose emphasis is on development, who is eager to learn from China's economic success and will never be forgotten by the US
 china ke sarkari dainik kaa pehla panna 27 may ko cheekh-chikhakar kah rahaa tha, ‘‘modi china ke saath sambandh badhayenge
 The editorial of the China Daily newspaper was elated at the prospect of forging a more constructive relationship between the two countries, which would be governed by their "common aspirations of achieving prosperity"
 narendra modi 2011 main jab china gaye the to unhen rashtradhyaksh jaisaa sammaan mila tha, great haul of pipal main swaagat samaaroh kaa durlabh saubhaahgya hasil hua tha or sattarudh paulitabeuro ke chaar sadasyon se unki mulaakaat karai gai thi
 China Daily recalls with great enthusiasm that Modi had shown the same respect to his hosts and the business cards he had been presented to him were "introduced in Chinese in red, the color of wealth and good fortune in China"
 Is considered a symbol
 ’’china main sarkaar ko ummid or yakeen he ki pradhanmantri modi ke netritv main bharat usee tarah china se nivesh chahega or use anukool andaaj main karne degaa jaisaa avasar modi ke netritv main gujarat main diya gaya tha
 Today, as China's biggest investment in Myanmar is facing allegations of mass movements and human rights abuses, Modi is seen in Beijing as a completely different partner to the ruling and affluent class: a man who Crushes the opposition and somehow knows the art of getting it done
 phir chaahe yah rasta uske samarthakon kii drushti main sahi ho yaa phir aalochakon kii najar main galat ho
 China has not forgotten that he was visiting China when the US was not giving visas to Modi
 dakshin asian maamalon ke jaankaar kyig pheng ne rashtravaadi akhbaar global times main sampadakeey lekh main kaha he ki jab pashchimi desh modi ko apamaanit kar rahe the or unka rasta roak rahe the tab ‘‘china ne vichaardhaara ke aadhaar par koi lakshmana rekha nahin khinchi thi
 "he says that these two views" are completely opposite
 ’’ unka tark he ki ab pashchim ke liye bharat ko lubhaana or china ko kaabo kar paanaa yakeenan mushkil hoga
 Despite this, the Chinese government cannot afford to think that Modi will sit on his lap
 vah jaanati he ki jin aarthik vajahon ke dabaav main modi china se pingen badha rahe the, vahi unhen america ke saath un sambandhon ko aage badhaane ke liye majaboor karenge, jinhen pichhali sarkaar ne devayani khobragade ke naam par taar-taar karke rakh diya he
 In Washington, the Obama government is now being advised to take advantage of the opportunity and make a fresh start with India's new government, especially Modi
 is akhbaar ne likhaa ki modi kii aarthik yojana bazaar ke liye itani aakarshak he ki is saal bhartiya share 15 fisadi uchhal gaye
 The value of the Indian currency has also improved
 modi 2007 or 2012 main japan gaye or gujarat main japani nivesh laane main safal rahe
 They are expected to strengthen defense and security ties with this East Asian country, China's biggest rival
 aisa lagata he ki modi ne ek or dabang rashtravaadi netaa japan ke pradhanmantri shinjo abe se gahari dosti kar lee he
 It is another matter that China neither likes nor believes Abe
 china jaanata hoga ki abe twitor par sirf teen logon ko follow karte hai, jinamein se ek modi bhi hai
 The government of China will be as keen on this relationship
 china main visheshgyon ko yah ummid katai nahin he ki modi bharat ke saath china ke varshon puraane seemaa vivaad ko chamatkaarik dhang se sulajhaa denge
 China does not seem to be in the mood to make some local concessions for India
 saath hi vah dakshini china or purvi china sagaron main apane samudri daavon ko antim had tak majboot karnaa chahta he
 During the campaign, Modi had advised China to abandon "its expansionist thinking", but that did not stop the bells in Beijing, but was largely seen as a propaganda weapon for the man
 , Who was desperate to strengthen his nationalist credentials
 china main ek sameekshak ne modi kii tulana america ke republican raashtrapati richard nicksan se karke surkhiyaan batori hai
 The world knows that Mao had deep relationships with Nixon with China
 phir bhi modi kii tulana atal bihari vaajapeyi se karne main adhik samajhadaari he
 Under his leadership, India's relations with China improved and the scope of trade expanded
 china kaa maananaa he ki congress kii tulana main bijepi ke kandhon par itihaas kii ghatnaon kaa boj kam he
 The memories of the 1962 border war are perhaps more personal, painful, and embarrassing for Congress
 china sarkaar bharat ke belgaum media ko kabhi nahin samaj pai or jab bharat ke adhik rashtravaadi televijan channelon ne seemaa par kathith atikaramanon ko lekar tikhi aalochana kii to china sarkaar iske liye bharat sarkaar ko jimmedaar maanane lagi
 As China has a habit of keeping an eye on the media, it was natural to suspect that India's foreign ministry is targeting it on the pretext of some event
 agar aisa nahin tha to bhi vah bhaawanaaon main ufaan ko tham saktaa tha
 The truth, however, was that television anchors were trying to fill the void created by the UPA government's silence and inaction as the government could not set an agenda
 china main visheshgyon kii raay main purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii sarkaar ‘‘anirnay or atyadhik saavdhaanee’’ main ghiri thi, jabaki modi ko ‘‘mahatvakankshi or aakraamak’’ mana ja rahaa he, jiskaa arth aalochana hona anivaary nahin he
 China is eager to work with at least someone it feels like
 ab china yah apeksha to kar hi saktaa he ki bhartiya videsh niti kii disha narendra modi se tay hogi, na ki ise televijan anker arnab goswami tay karenge

 is samay bazaar main badi dawa company bair kii jo dawa uplabdh he, uski tulana main nannapaneni kii dawa par marij ko maatr teen fisadi hi paise kharch karne honge
 With this, the 31-year-old Natco Pharma Limited has become the first Indian company to be issued a compulsory license (CL) by the Controller of Patents
 natco bharat main bair kii dawa naikshavar kaa generik sanskaran banaaegi
 Nexavar's dose of 120 tablets a month at the moment is Rs 2,80,428 in the market

 ek aitihaasik aadesh ke tahat controlar ne siel jari kiya he
 The order was based on three aspects - Bayer Nexavar was not meeting demand, despite being approved in 2005, it was not being produced in India and the drug was not available in the Indian market at a reasonable price
 
 natco ko nirdesh diya gaya he ki vah bair ko psoracevnet kii bikri kaa chah fisadi roylty ke rup main chukaayegi or dawa kii bikri or roylty ke bhugtan kaa vivaran har timahi main pesh karegi
 Looking at the victory of Nannapaneni, it is expected that this will usher in a new trend
 sanshodhit patent kanoon lagu hone ke baad se, pichley saat varsh main anivaary license die jane kaa yah pehla maamla he
 Under Section 84 of the Patent Law of 1970, within a period of three years after a patent is issued, any person can apply for a compulsory license on a patent from the Controller on one of the reasons listed below - Patented Search In the context of people's needs were not met, the drug is not available in the market at an affordable price and that it has not started production in India
 haalanki bair is aadesh ko adaalat main chunauti de sakati he, par isse gharelu dawa companiyon ko mahangi dawaaiyon ke sandarbh main utpaada kaa generik sanskaran shuru karne ke alaava anivaary license kaa vikalp apnaane kaa rasta khul gaya he

 Natco had sought a voluntary license from Bayer to produce and distribute generic Nexavar, which it rejected
 phir natco ne 2011 main anivaary license ke liye aavedan kiya
 a compulsory license under the patent system is a binding contract between an unregulated seller and an interested buyer, which the government imposes and enforces and is used in developed and developing countries

 sister haryana ke gohana main surang ke jariye bank lut ke maamle main ek nayaa mode aa gaya he
 Police investigation is coming out bank lut kii sajeesh main chaar or log bhi shaamil the or inhen surang khodne ke liye paanch-paanch hajaar rupee die gaye the
 Arvind, who was arrested on Friday, also helped dig the tunnel by taking five thousand rupees
 is maamle main ab tak chaar logon ko giraftaar kiya ja chukaa he or unase 43 kilo, 522 gram gahane baraamad ho chuke hai
 One of the main accused, absconding accused Rajesh, is looking for five police teams in Haryana and adjoining states
 deshbhar main logon ko chaunkaane vaale is bank lut ke mastermind ne khudakushi kar lee thi
 Interestingly, the desolate house in which the tunnel began to be dug was its owner
 bahujan samaaj party (bispi) supremeomayawatike bayaan par samaajawaadee party (sapa) main halchal much gai he
 The SP is unable to understand that the alliance it formed with BSP to defeat BJP in 2019 will have its fate
 mayawatine abhi haal main yah kahkar siyaasi uthal-puthal machaa di ki na to ve kisi kii 'buaa' hai or na hi unka koi 'bhatija' he
 There is no doubt that Mayawati is a common leader of Dalits, hence BJP and SP always try to combine with BSP
 in donon partiyon ko lagata he ki bispi supremeo se unka gathjod ho saktaa he
 There is not a single BSP leader in Agra who can say anything about Mayawati and her recent 'mood swings', but SP chief Akhilesh Yadav is easily seen doing 'damage Control'
 akhilesh philhal teen morchon par ek saath jujh rahe hai-bijepi kaa hamalavar rukh, mayawati kii mahatvakanksha or apane chachashivpal yadavaki banaai party samaajawaadee secular morcha ke asann khatre
 While the BJP is blaming the image of Akhilesh's 'progressive leader' by shedding the winds of development in UP, Mayawati is opening her leaves only when all the leaves are gone
 akhilesh ke liye isse bhi gambhir baat yah he ki unke chachaa ne jo party banaai he, vah aaj nahin to kal samaajawaadee party ke votbank main daraar daalegi kyonki kai netaa aise hai jo akhilesh se khaar khaae hai or ve shivpal ke sampark main hai
 a SP leader told India Today that what was feared happened and Mayawati changed her face after all the bargaining
 mayawati ne dekh liya ki agle chunaav main sapa kaa adhikansh votashivpal yadavaki party ko ja saktaa he
 The end result of which is a breach in sp's vote bank
 aisi sthiti main sapa ko voton kaa ghaataa hoga or bijepi aaraam se nikal jaaegi
 The leader further said, when the SP and Congress contested together in the last election, the votebank alliance of both parties could not be found
 isse sapa kii karaari haar ho gai
 Something similar can happen in the 2019 elections, when the BJP gets a one-time vote and goes ahead
 sambhav he ki mayawati bhi isi line par soch rahi hon ki gaiyr-bijepi gathbandhan ko agar wo saport karti hai, to bispi kaa votbank to gathbandhan ko ja saktaa he lekin gathbandhan kaa vot unhen mili, is par sanshay he
 Thinking something like this, they have decided to stay apart

 Sneha told The Hindu that this is an important step towards social change
 usase bhi zyada sneha ko bina jati or dharm ke khud kii ek alag pahchaan chahie thi
 No caste or no religion certificate, Sneha said, all the columns of cast and religion are empty in all my certificates
 isamen meraa janm praaanpatr or skool ke sabhi certifikates shaamil hai
 Of all these, only i am described as Indian
 mujhe mahasoos hua ki sabhi aplication main saamudayik pramaan patr anivaary tha, isiilie mujhe ek aatm-shapath patr praapt karnaa hi tha
 So that i can prove in the papers that i am not associated with any caste and religion
 jab jati or dharm ko maanane waalon ke liye praaanpatr hote hai to ham jaise logon ke liye kyon nahin
 Sneha applied for no-caste, no-religion in the year 2010 and received this certificate on 5 February 2019 after much difficulty
 ab sneha pehali aisi shaks yaa mahila ban gai hai jinke paas yah praaanpatr he

 It is another matter that one gets around by wandering that maybe it takes time to arrive
 is lihaaz se raajnneetik charchaaon main bijepi ne paryaapt jagah bana lee he
 It also means that the CPM was not the number one party in front of the Trinamool Congress
 congress kaa to parchaa bhi kahin bikharaa hua nahin miltaa
 People quickly settle the Congress in a line that the party is not visible at all
 is baat main bahut dam bhi he
 Posters of BJP and CPM are also seen about the Sharda scam, but Congress is nowhere to be seen
 mushkil se bada bazaar main kuch dukaanon par congress kaa jhanda dikhaa
 At the same time, a flower-decorated statue of Indira, Rajiv and Mahatma Gandhi was also seen, but apart from these exceptions, the Congress has become an endangered party
 sipiem ne sharada ghotaale ko lekar mamata par hamalaa bolaa he, lekin vah bhi siyaasi charchaaon main tezi se neeche sarakati ja rahi he
 a gentleman said that the supporters and workers of CPM first went to Trinamool and now they have found another base 'BJP'
 ek bank karmchaaree ne kaha, trinmul abhi bengal kaa sipiem ban gaya he, bijepi ko andolan ke raste aana hoga or yah rasta lambaa he, isliye do saal baad seat to bad jaaegi, magar sarkaar nahin bana sakegi
 Who is the leader they have
 
 
 ? bijepi ko bhi andolan ke lambey daur se guzaranaa hoga
 
 
 "bank employees were expressing their understanding like principle
 ek ritred skool master se kaha ki trinmul sipiem he to hans die, bole ki bengal main sab jaanata he ki sipiem ko kamazor padataa dekh unke kaaryakarta sangrakshan ke liye trinmul main aa gaye or jo sipiem main rah gaye, unamem se kuch ab bijepi main ja rahe hai, sharada scam ko lekar bijepi aakraamak ho gai he
 
 
 Due to CBI and ED, BJP has been successful in giving the message that it is now in a position to provide protection in Bengal
 master sahab kii baat se ek baat samaj aa gai ki logon ne pehle sipiem se mukti pai or ab agar trinmul bhi sipiem banati ja rahi he to yah baat party ke liye shubh sanket to nahin he
 Keep in mind that all the talks are happening in Kolkata
 
 
 kolkata kaa madhyamvarg badal gaya he
 He wants to connect his political outlook or identity to a national party through BJP
 mamata banerjee puri tarah se kshetreey bhoomika main simat gai hai or yah baat kisi bhi kshetreey dal ke madhyamvargeey aadhaar ke liye khatare kii ghanti he
 Mamta and Left are so entangled and confined in their rural base that middle-class or middle-class aspirants from villages to towns, cities, are wandering around politically without parents
 is tabake kaa gaiyr-raajnneetikaran hi bijepi ke liye sambhaavnaaen paidaa kar rahaa he
 Despite this, the Trinamool is fighting this battle every day

 Even after being surrounded by the Saradha investigation, only posters of Mamata Banerjee are seen in Kolkata

 In the street, flags of Trinamool are seen

 The posters contain flocks of photographs of work done locally
 bijepi ke bhi poster hai, magar trinmul ke anupaat main kam
 BJP is seen fighting in the city in terms of posters and flags
 uskaa har hamalaa sharada ko lekar he to trinmul ne bhi sharada ke jawaab main sahaara dhund liya he
 The Trinamool has placed huge hoardings on the nooks
 inamen jail main band 'subrat raay sahaara' kii tasviir ko laal ghere main rakhaa gaya he
 In some frame there is Narendra Modi with Subrata Rai Sahara, in some Arun Jaitley and in some by Ravi Shankar Prasad
 shaayad isi ladaaku pravriti ke kaaran charchaakaron ko lagata he ki trinmul itani aasaani se bengal haath se jane nahin degi, lekin bijepi bhi kahaan itani aasaani se haar maanane vaali he
 The glut of posters of Vivekananda and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose in the city suggest that these two great men are going to be very useful in the election of Bengal
 bijepi ko pataa he ki trinmul kii zamin kitni majboot he
 In the Modi wave of the Lok Sabha also, the Trinamool Congress had won 33 seats
 tab bhi sharada scam tha, lekin itani giraftaaryaan nahin hui thim
 The Legislative Assembly also has more than 180 mlas
 party kii agar pakad majboot na hoti to prati loksabhaa paanch siton ke hisaab se vidhansabha kii 165 siton par jeet hasil nahin karti
 This fact cannot be ignored
 lekin ab aap is sach ko bhi nazarandaaz nahin kar sakate ki 'trinmul ke saamne koun' kii bahes main bijepi khadi ho gai he
 There is still a lot of time in 2016, so it is a big thing to get a place in the first place

 The Because i want industry in Bengal

 It was a long talk with the youth
 jaldi-jaldi cigarette pine par kaha ki band nahin to kam nahin kar sakate
 
 
 Now even the Prime Minister is appealing to you people in Mann Ki Baat
 
 
 ladakon ne muskura diya, drugs or tambaakoo main ve fark samajhate hai
 i said that Dr
 Harsh Vardhan, the first Health Minister of the Modi government, was against cigarettes, so be silent on it, maybe it is his private space and in this case he does not like political interference, but as soon as i told him that Kolkata's big All the big traders of tobacco and bidi are present in the market, there is a new flag of BJP in front of everyone's shop, then the boys laughed hoarsely
 bengal bijepi ke aane yaa na aane ko lekar bahes kar rahaa he
 The resources and organization that it has to accommodate the huge vacant ground of opposition lying in front of the Trinamool will make a place
 bijepi ke paas sansaadhan or sanghathan kii koi kami nahin he, left bhi is baat ko acchhee tarah se samaj rahaa he, tabhi kai vamadal janata parivaar kii tarah ekajute ho rahe hai, lekin slogan or posterbazi ke master left ke netaaon ko main nahin bataanaa chahta

 '' saurav ne paak mehmaannawaaji kaa vah vakya bhi yaad kiya jab ek dukandaar ne unase isliye unke pasandida pakistani juuton kii keemat lene se manaa kar diya tha kyonki ve uske mehmaan the
 But Kapil reminded that before Sourav, the taste of indo-pak cricket was too hot
 kapil ne kaha, ''ham aise dostana khel kii baat soch hi nahin sakate the
 At that time, it seemed that if you win, you have to win, but you have to come after beating the front

 vah 10 aktubar 1993 kaa din tha jab pehali baar cricket ke do sitare ek saath cricket ke maidan par utre the
 These two men named Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid were face to face then
 sanyog dekhie ki us anjaan si ghatana ke thik 20 saal baad ye donon mahaan ballebaaj ek duusare ke virdohi khemon main khelkar juda ho rahe hai or yah aitihaasik kshan he
 Tendulkar and Dravid are two legends of world cricket, not just India
 in donon kaa cricket ke maidan par pehla milan rajkot ke municipal stadium main 10 aktubar 1993 ko hua tha
 In this match of the Duleep Trophy, Tendulkar was playing for the West Zone and Dravid South Zone
 tendulkar jab match ke pehle din shaam ko krij par utre to dravid sambhavat: kshetrarakshan ke apane sabase priy sthaan slip main khadey rahe honge
 Dravid still needed Tendulkar's wicket and this is his wish 20 years later
 in 20 varshon main haalanki duniya ne tendulkar or dravid ko pratidwandvi kam or saathi ke rup main adhik dekha
 After all, they supported each other in 146 Tests and 245 odis
 test maichon main 6920 ran ek duusare ke saath milakar jode
 This is the world record of partnership between any two batsmen
 dravid ne tendulkar ko test maichon main 12586 ran or 40 shatak lagaate hue dekha
 On the other hand Tendulkar also witnessed Dravid's 11894 Test runs and 34 centuries
 in donon ne 50 test maichon main jeet kaa milakar jashn manaaya to 44 aise avasar bhi aae jab unhen ek duusare ke saath milakar haar kaa gam bhulaanaa padaa
 Tendulkar and Dravid played in a team for the first time on 28 December 1995, taking on each other's opponents in their early years
 tendulkar tab tak bada naam ho gaya tha or unhen chalanger trophy ke liye bharat-e team kaa captain banaaya gaya tha
 Dravid was included in his team
 sanyog se saurav ganguli bhi us team kaa hissaa the
 Tendulkar and Dravid together represented the Indian team for the first time in Pedang, Singapore against Sri Lanka on 3 April 1996, almost three months after the match
 iske dhai maheene baad england ke khilaaf aitihaasik lards maidan par ye donon diggaj test maichon main bhi saathi ban gaye the
 Tendulkar and Dravid also had a lot of juggling in one-day internationals
 donon ne milakar 98 van-de main 4117 ran kii saajhedaari kii
 These include 11 century partnerships
 in donon ne newjiland ke khilaaf 8 november 1999 ko hyderabad main duusare wicket ke liye 331 ran jode the jo aaj bhi vishwa record he
 In Dravid's presence, Tendulkar scored 9743 runs and 28 centuries in odis
 is bich tendulkar ne bhi dravid ko 7858 van-de ran or 8 shatak tathaa 63 ardhshtak lagaate hue dekha
 They both played the most 43 matches against arch-rivals Pakistan
 ab champions lig tii-20 kaa final vah aakhri match mana ja rahaa he jisamen tendulkar or dravid ek saath maidan par virajman rahe
 Incidentally, in this short form of cricket, these two great players never got the chance to become each other's partner
 ve tii-20 main jab bhi ek saath maidan par utre to ek duusare ke pratidwandvi hi rahe
 It is also no less interesting that this time the Champions League started with a match between the teams of these two veterans and the teams of both of them are concluding
 tendulkar pichley saal van-de or is saal ke shuru main ipel se sanyas le chuke hai
 The comments tendulkar ab apana puraa dhyaan test maichon par lagaana chaahate hai
 He will achieve a new feat by playing the 200th Test match against the West Indies in November this year
 antarrashtriya cricket ko pehle hi alavida kah chuke dravid bhi sambhavat: ab aage pratispardhi cricket nahin khelenge
 He has already indicated this

 This is the world record of partnership between any two batsmen
 dravid ne tendulkar ko test maichon main 12586 ran or 40 shatak lagaate hue dekha
 On the other hand Tendulkar also witnessed Dravid's 11894 Test runs and 34 centuries
 in donon ne 50 test maichon main jeet kaa milakar jashn manaaya to 44 aise avasar bhi aae jab unhen ek duusare ke saath milakar haar kaa gam bhulaanaa padaa
 Tendulkar and Dravid played in a team for the first time on 28 December 1995, taking on each other's opponents in their early years
 tendulkar tab tak bada naam ho gaya tha or unhen chalanger trophy ke liye bharat-e team kaa captain banaaya gaya tha
 Dravid was included in his team
 sanyog se saurav ganguli bhi us team kaa hissaa the
 Tendulkar and Dravid together represented the Indian team for the first time in Pedang, Singapore against Sri Lanka on 3 April 1996, almost three months after the match
 iske dhai maheene baad england ke khilaaf aitihaasik lards maidan par ye donon diggaj test maichon main bhi saathi ban gaye the
 Tendulkar and Dravid also had a lot of juggling in one-day internationals

 Incidentally, in this short form of cricket, these two great players never got the chance to become each other's partner
 ve tii-20 main jab bhi ek saath maidan par utre to ek duusare ke pratidwandvi hi rahe
 It is also no less interesting that this time the Champions League started with a match between the teams of these two veterans and the teams of both of them are concluding
 tendulkar pichley saal van-de or is saal ke shuru main ipel se sanyas le chuke hai
 The comments tendulkar ab apana puraa dhyaan test maichon par lagaana chaahate hai
 He will achieve a new feat by playing the 200th Test match against the West Indies in November this year
 antarrashtriya cricket ko pehle hi alavida kah chuke dravid bhi sambhavat: ab aage pratispardhi cricket nahin khelenge
 He has already indicated this
 tendulkar or dravid bhale hi pratidwandvi ke taur par cricket ke maidan par se ek duusare se vidaai le rahe hon, lekin 20 saal main in ye donon keval 18 baar ek duusare ke aamane-saamne rahe
 When Tendulkar landed at the crease in the evening on the first day of the match, Dravid may have been standing at slip, his favorite place of fielding
 dravid ko tab bhi tendulkar ke wicket kii darkaar thi or 20 saal baad unki yahi tamanna he
 In these 20 years however, the world saw Tendulkar and Dravid less as rivals and more as companions
 aakhir 146 test or 245 ek-divasiy maichon main unhone ek duusare kaa saath diya
 In Test matches, 6920 runs were added together
 kinhin do ballebaajon ke bich saajhedaari kaa yah vishwa record he
 Dravid saw Tendulkar score 12586 runs and 40 centuries in Tests
 duusari taraf tendulkar bhi dravid ke 11894 test ranon or 34 shatakon ke gavaah rahe
 Both of them celebrated the victory together in 50 Test matches and there were 44 occasions when they had to forget the loss of each other together
 apane shuruaati varshon main ek duusare ke pratidwandvi ke rup main maidan par utarane vaale tendulkar or dravid pehali baar 28 disambar 1995 ko ek team main khele
 Tendulkar had by then become a big name and was named captain of the india-a team for the Challenger Trophy
 dravid ko unki team main shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Incidentally, Sourav Ganguly was also a part of that team
 is match ke lagbhag teen maheene baad 3 april 1996 ko srilanka ke khilaaf singapore ke pedang main pehali baar tendulkar or dravid ne ek saath bhartiya team kaa pratinidhitiv kiya
 Two and a half months later, both of these veterans also became partners in Test matches against England at the historic Lord's ground
 ek-divasiy antarrashtriya maichon main bhi tendulkar or dravid kii jugalbandi khub dikhi
 The two shared a 4117-run partnership in 98 odis
 inamen 11 shatkeey saajhedaariyaan bhi shaamil hai

 Meanwhile, Tendulkar also saw Dravid scoring 7858 one-day runs and scoring 8 centuries and 63 fifties
 in donon ne chir-pratidwandvi pakistan ke khilaaf sarvaadhik 43 match khele
 Now the final of the Champions League T20 is considered to be the last match in which Tendulkar and Dravid are together on the field
 sanyog dekhie ki cricket ke is chote praaroop main in donon mahaan khilaadiyon ko kabhi ek duusare kaa saathi banane kaa mauka nahin mila
 Whenever they came on the field together in T20, they were the rival of each other
 yah bhi kam dilachasp nahin he ki is baar champions lig kii shuruyaat in donon diggajon kii tiimon ke mukaable se hui or samaapan bhi in donon kii timen kar rahi hai
 Tendulkar retired from IPL last year and IPL earlier this year
 tippaniyan Tendulkar now wants to focus his attention on Test matches
 vah is saal november main westeindies ke khilaaf 200waan test match khelkar nai uplabdhi hasil karenge
 Dravid, who has already said goodbye to international cricket, will probably no longer play competitive cricket
 vah pehle hi iskaa sanket de chuke hai

 We are slowly opening up our economy

 unhone kaha, ab bhi kai aise kshetra hai, jo antarashtriya bazaar ke liye band hai yaa pratibandhit hai
 They will also be opened, but the areas that are being opened up are quite large
 ve sabhi kshetra vinirmaan se sambandhit hai
 Steel, electricity, roads, airports and seaports - all these areas are open
 in kshetron main niveshkon ke liye kaaphi avasar hai

 unhen bhi khol diya jayega, lekin jin kshetron ko kholaa ja rahaa he ve kaaphi bade hai
 All those sectors are related to manufacturing
 ispaat, bijli, sadaken, hawaondde or bandargahen - ye sabhi kshetra khule hue hai
 There are a lot of opportunities for investors in these areas

 i think it was probably said by Jim o'neill of Goldman Sachs

 But the court also questioned the cbi's inquiry in its judgment and said that it failed to prove the charge
 yediurppa par aropalgaya gaya tha ki unhone dipti siem rahete hue 2006 main ek acre sarkari jameen ko dinotiphoi kar diya, jisase ki jameen esen krishnaiya shetty kii ho gai or unhone baad main jameen ko yediurppa ke beton ko 20 lakh rupee main bech diya

 yediurppa ke beton par yah bhi aarope tha ki unhone gaiyr krishi kshetra se 2 lakh rupee se adhik kii salanaa aay hone ke baavjood bhi unhone ise kam dikhaaya, taaki kheti ke naam par plot le saken
 The court also dismissed the allegation and said that Yeddyurappa's sons had little income before 2005-06
