 There is only a small expectation that leads to solutions to big problems

 Is Sharad Yadav hoping for a solution on his own or is there something else? On his first meeting with Disclaimer, Sharad Yadav has already clarified, 'if it is being speculated that i will join him in the Janata Parivar If i came to invite you, it would be wrong
 ' pidipi ke lok sabha main teen or rajya sabha main do saansad hai

 Is there really a magic wand in the hands of the Mufti beyond 'self rule' that can solve the Kashmir problem? Or Sharad Yadav gave this statement because he had to say something in the media
 samaajawaadee party ke adhyakikhileshyadav ne muslim-yadav (M-Y) maton ke dam par basapa ke saath haath milakar 2019 main modi ko maat dene kaa khwab sanjoya he
 In this path of Akhilesh, his uncle Shashivpal Yadav has become the biggest obstacle
 sapa se naata todakarasamajwaadee secular morchabanane ke baad se shivpal sapa ke M-Y sameekaran main sendhamari main jute gaye hai
 Let me tell you that in UP 20 percent Muslim and 12 percent candidates are considered as the original vote bank of SP
 inhen donon samudaay ke votbank ke dam par mulaayam singh yadav se lekar akhilesh yadav tak satta ke singhaasana tak pahunche
 Shivpal Yadav is now eyeing this vote bank
 shivpal yadav kaa samaajawaadee secular morcha sapa ke ruthe netaaon kaa thikaana banataa ja rahaa he
 In this too, the continuation of Yadav and Muslim leaders in particular is associated with Shivpal's front
 sapa ke alpsankhyak morche ke pradesh adhyaksh rahe farhat miyaan bhi secular morcha se jud gaye hai
 Former MP Ram Singh, two-time former MP from Etawah, Raghuraj Shakya, five-time MLA from Dumriaganj seat, Yusuf Malik has joined the Samajwadi Secular Front
 iske alaava jila or vidhansabha str se sapa netaa akhilesh kaa saath chhodkar shivpal ke saath jud rahe hai
 Shivpal Yadav has also given place to three Muslim and 2 Yadav community leaders in his list of 9 spokespersons
 itnaa hi nahin akhilesh sarkaar main mantri rahe sharada pratap shukla or shaadaab fatima bhi is fehrist main shaamil hai
 What will the appearance of Shivpal Yadav's front be like
 isaki tasviir ab saaf hoti najar aa rahi he
 He has decided to form a Samajwadi Secular Front, putting an end to speculation about joining the BJP with an understanding of the current political mood and keeping Muslim voters with him
 farhat miyaan ne ajtak se kaha ki maujuuda daur main sapa or bijepi ke bich koi fark nahin rah gaya he
 BJP also talks about the temple and Akhilesh Yadav
 mulaayam singh yadav ke mul siddhanton se party bahak chuki he
 Netaji is not being respected in the party, it was suffocating while living in such a SP
 isi ke maddenjar hamane samaajawaadee secular morcha se judane kaa faisla kiya he
 He said that the Morcha formed under the leadership of Shivpal Yadav will become the voice of the oppressed, crushed, backward, Dalit, minority and farmers of the society and will go about these issues
 isi siddhant ko lekar netaji (mulaayam singh yadav) ne sapa kaa gathan kiya tha
 Farhat Mia said that Yadav and Shivpal Yadav stand between them in every trouble of the Muslim community
 aise main ye donon samudaayon ke bich unki ahmiyat kaaphi he
 People of all communities will get equal respect in the Morcha State Executive and National Executive
 bataa den ki mulaayam singh ke sapa adhyaksh rahete hue shivpal yadav party ke sarvesarva hua karte the
 While the SP was in power, Shivpal used to come forward to help the people of the Yadav community, hoping for help
 yahi vajah he ki party sanghathan se lekar yadav samudaay ke bich unki behatar or majboot pakad rahi
 As a result of this, a large crowd of the Yadav community gathered in Lucknow on Tuesday after leaving the SP
 yahi nahin unke samaajawaadee secular morcha banane par yadav or muslim samudaay ke logon kii ore se lagaai badhai hording se saaf samajha ja saktaa he
 Not only this, they are constantly trying to connect Yadav and Muslims with them
 mainpuri, firozabad, agra, mathura, aligarh, hathras, eta or purvi uttar pradesh ke kuch jilon main shivpal yadav kii acchhee pakad he
 This is also the stronghold of SP
 aise main shivpal ne 2019 main sabhi 80 loksabhaa siton par chunaav ladane kaa elaan kar diya he

 shivpal yadav kii raajnneetik gatividhiyon par sapa najar lagaae hue hai
 SP leaders have been asked to remain silent on behalf of the party high command to avoid any controversy
 yahi vajah he ki jab hamane is sambandh main sapa pravaktaaon se baatcheet kerani chahie to kisi ne bhi sidhe jawaab nahin diya
 Instead of giving a direct reply to Shivpal Yadav, SP national spokesperson Amik Jamei said that the 2019 fight is between two ideologies
 ek taraf sangh or bijepi hai jabaki duusari ore janata he
 There is none other than this
 hamaari pehali praathamikta bijepi ko 2019 main satta se baahar karnaa he

 mashhoor biscuit Parle g ke jariye har parivaar main ek khaas pahchaan banane vaali company Parle bure daur se guzar rahi he
 Things have become so bad that Parle may lay off 10,000 employees in the coming days
 lekin sawaal he ki kareeb 90 saal puraani company Parle ke bure din kyon aa gaye hai or iske liye company sarkaar se kya ummid karti he
 India Today spoke to Mayank Shah, the category head of Parle Products, to find out the answer to all these questions
 india today se baatcheet ke dauraan mayank shah ne bataaya ki yah pehla mauka he jab Parle kii maang main lagaataar giravat dekhi ja rahi he
 We have made every effort to deal with it but no one is able to understand the reason
 mayank shah ke mutabik hamane market main product ko push karne kii koshish kii
 Apart from this, we tried to convince the customers about the product
 lekin tex badhotaree or aarthik susti ne bikri ko prabhavit kiya he
 He further stated that the company is going through its most difficult period
 shah ke mutabik customer kisi achche utpaada ke liye adhik bhugtan karne ko baadhya nahin he, lekin arthvyavastha main dhimi gati se giravat or jiesti kii vruddhi ne hamen prabhavit kiya he
 Why are we not in favor of Parle in such a bad condition? In response to this question by India Today, Mayank Shah said, "obviously, rural sentiments have been affected
 matlab yah ki gramin ilaake main bikri main giravat dekhne ko mili he
 We are not seeking favor from the government like others
 '' shah kaa kahana he ki system ko kaarobaar ke liye saral bananaa chahie
 There is nothing like Ahsan or kindness
 jiesti kii vajah se halaat bigadeshah ne is dauraan jiesti lagu hone ke baad bigade halaat kaa bhi zikr kiya
 He said, "the biscuits are mainly divided into two categories (more than Rs 100 per kg and less)
 GST lagu hone se pehle 100 rupee prati kilo se kam keemat vaale biscuit par 12 fisadi tex lagaaya jaataa tha
 But after the implementation of GST, the situation changed and all the biscuits were put in the slab of 18 per cent
 yah thik nahin tha
 The effect of this was that biscuit companies had to increase their prices and due to this, there has been a decline in sales
 shah ke mutabik aaj ham lagbhag 10 companiyon main pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh rup se kareeb 1 lakh logon ko naukari de rahe hai
 On the question about layoffs in Parle, Mayank Shah said that when there is a long-term decline in demand, naturally the job cuts are done
 masalan, ham 1000 ton biscuit ke liye 1000 logon kaa upyog karte hai to jab maang main kami he to mujhe logon kii sankhya bhi kam kerani hogi yaa khud nuksaan uthaanaa hoga
 Our quarter demand has fallen by 7-8 per cent
 chunavi mausam main bhi phayda nahinam taur par chunavi mausam main biscuit kii maang main vruddhi dekhi jaati he lekin is baar kya halaat rahe? is sawaal ke jawaab main mayank shah ne bataaya, ''chunaavon ke dauraan bahut sari gatividhiyaan hoti hai or isliye bahut khapat hoti he
 However, this time there was a loss due to strictness regarding the expenses of the candidates

 The Iraqi army is going to fight its biggest war in Mosul, Iraq's second largest city after Baghdad, after 13 years
 mosul vahi shahar he, jis par kabja karne ke baad bagdadi ne khud ko khalipha or mosul ko aies kaa headquarter qaraar diya tha
 But now, two years later, more than thirty thousand Iraqi forces have mounted Mosul and announced the final defeat of Baghdadi
 jis iraq se bagdadi or aies ne sir uthaaya tha, usee iraq main ab uskaa khaatmaa tay he
 The Iraqi Prime Minister has declared the final war to end IS
 iraqi phujon ne mosul ko dehshatgardi se rihaai dilaane ke liye morche sambhaal liye hai
 With this, the accounts of Baghdadi terrorists are being accounted for on this sandy land
 iraq main islamic state ke taabut main aakhri keel thonkane ke liye 13 saal baad iraq main shuru ho gai he
 Iraq had witnessed such a big war before in 2003
 jab america ne saddaam hossain kaa takhta palatney ke liye hamalaa bolaa tha
 This is the battle to liberate Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, from the annexation of the Islamic State
 bagdadi or uske ladaakon se mosul ko aaazaad karaane ke liye kareeb 30 hajaar sainikon kii fouj kooch kar chuki he
 These troops are supported by about 90 Iraqi airplanes
 mosul main aatank ke safaaye ke liye shuru hue is oparation main ab tak mili jaankaree ke mutabik sena ke hawaii hamalon main aies ke 20 aatanki maare gaye hai
 While the fast advancing army is able to drive out the terrorists on one side, on the other hand it has started occupying the areas and villages around Mosul
 aatanki sena par kar rahe hamalislamic state kaa safaya karne ke liye iraqi sena kaa saath dene ke liye america ne 67 deshon kii mitra sena banaai he or ye sabhi mosul ko aaazaad karaane ke abhiyaan main shaamil hai
 To ease the task for the Iraqi army, the Allied forces are carrying out air strikes on enemy targets
 mosul se apane kadamon ko ukhdta dekh iesas ne jagah-jagah suicide car bombers tainaat kar die hai
 As the Iraqi army moves towards Mosul
 aies kii taraf se ho rahe ye hamale bhi bad rahe hai
 The terrorists are constantly attacking the army
 haar kareeb dekh unhone mosul ke kai tel ke kuon main aag bhi laga di he
 It is being said that if the IS capture from the city of Mosul ends, then these terrorists who are looking for their land in Iraq may be forced to move to another country
 iraq se islamic state kaa khaatmaa!15 lakh kii aabaadi vaale mosul shahar se kareeb teen lakh log pehle hi bhaag chuke hai
 Now after the Iraqi army's ascent, about one lakh people are leaving Mosul and heading towards Syria and Turkey
 darasal mosul ke logon ko khatra ye he ki haar kareeb dekhakar aies ke aatankwaadi unhen apni dhaal bana sakate hai
 IS has started this as well
 wo tel ke kuen main aag lagane ke saath-saath sadakon par tel phenk kar unamem bhi aag laga rahaa he
 Independence of the city of Mosul is essential for the elimination of IS
 darasal june 2014 main mosul par kabja karne ke baad bagdadi ne ise na sirf apane aatank ke samrajya kii rajdhani banaaya
 Rather, he also announced his own Khilafat from here
 isliye agar mosul main bagdadi kii shikast hoti he to jaahir taur par iskaa matlab he iraq se islamic state kaa khaatmaa
 Not only can war be prolonged, Mosul has a lot of oil reserves
 agar ye shahar haath se jaataa he to aies kii kamai kaa ek bada jariya band ho jayega
 After this, only 10 percent of Iraq will be affected by IS
 pentagon ke mutabik iraqi sena apane tay lakshya se aage chal rahi he
 However, it is also being feared that this war to evacuate Mosul from terrorists can be prolonged
 iske sanket bhi mil rahe hai
 The militants are going to any extent in retaliation to prevent the Iraqi army from entering Mosul
 sena ke tinkon ko nishaanaa banane ke alaava aatanki shahar ke andar tel failaa kar usamen aag laga rahe hai
 Due to which a huge rush of smoke is rising in the whole city and under the guise of this balloon, they are preparing a way to escape for themselves
 3 lakh logon ne choda apana gharek taraf jahaan mosul kaa ye mahayuddh pratishtha kaa sawaal ban chukaa he
 At the same time, there is growing concern about the safety of 1
5 million people living in the city
 andeshaa he ki aatanki apni jaan bachaane ke liye aam logon kaa dhaal kii tarah istemaal kar sakate hai
 Therefore, to deal with such a situation, the Iraqi army has dropped a large number of leaflets on the city of Mosul
 jisamen aam logon ko naseehat di ja rahi he ki ladaai ke dauraan apni suraksha ke liye unhen kya karnaa he
 The United Nations fears that about one lakh Iraqis may have to flee Syria or Turkey to save their lives due to the fighting in Mosul
 iraq main aatankiyon ke khauf se kareeb teen lakh se zyada log pehle se hi apane apane gharon ko chhodkar ja chuke hai
 Therefore, arrangements have already been started to help the refugees in the event of such a situation again
 bagdadi kii hogi sabase badi shikast!mosul ko aatankiyon ke changul se reeha karaane ke liye shuru hue is oparation kii taiyaari kareeb ek maheene se chal rahi thim
 The Iraqi army has not yet reached Mosul
 magar abhi se hi aatanki baukhalaaye najar aa rahe hai
 Experts believe that the countdown to the complete elimination of the Islamic State in Iraq has begun, as the city of Iraq is still a stronghold of IS
 baaki ilaakon se to uske pair kab ke ukhd chuke hai
 Even in Syria, only the city of Raqqa remains in possession of the Islamic State
 aise main mosul kii haar bagdadi kii ab tak kii sabase bady shikast hogi

 input:bhashaa The number of supporters of BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be in crores, but if a BJP supporter gets a chance to become a part of BJP IT cell directly and also earn Rs 300 every day, then who would want to miss such an opportunity
 aajkal soshal media par viral ho rahaa ek massej thik yahi daawa kar rahaa he
 The claim is also being made directly in the "BJP website", in which it is being said that you can not only help Narendra Modi to win in 2019, but can also earn at least 300 rupees every day
 Huh
 massej ke aakhir main die gaye link par clic karne ko bhi kaha gaya he
 The special thing is that the website that is being mentioned in this message is www
 bjƿ
 com, anyone can see the BJP party website
 haalanki bijepi kii asli website www
 bjp
 org he
 But when you click on this link, it will take you to another web page, not the BJP website
 aap dekhenge ki broujar main adress khud ba khud badal kar http: / / www
 xn - bj-o1a
 com / ho jayega
 The page that opens with this address, there is a big logo with lotus flower on bjp's election symbol
 neeche bijepi iti cell kaa member banane ke liye ek form ke bare main bataaya gaya he
 The website is completely saffron-colored and features photographs of Vivekananda as well as Modi
 web pej ke aakhir main ek form diya gaya he jisamen apana naam, kaantect number, whatsap number, rajya or city kaa byora dene ko kaha gaya he
 The first evidence of fake website is found only when you look carefully at the address given in whatsapp
 http: / / www
 bjƿ
 com jisamen bjƿ kaa ''p'' kuch alag sa nazar aayega
 Actually, the whole fursiwada is hidden behind the letter that looks like "p"
 ye akshar angreji kaa ''p'' nahin he, balki ek latin akshar ''ƿ'' he jise ''wynn'' kaha jaataa he
 The creator of the website has used this letter very cleanly, so that anyone can deceive it by considering it as BJP
 bijepi kii website www
 bjp
 org he lekin agar aap www
 bjp
 com ke naam se bhi search karte hai to website bijepi kii hi khulegi
 This is because all the big organizations usually register similar names on their own, so that they are not misused and people do not get cheated by visiting fake websites
 jaise ajtak kii website he https: / / aajtak
 intoday
 in
 But if you aajtak
 com bhi search karenge to khulegi ajtak kii website hi

 yah paribhaasha kasaab ke maamle main bhi lagu hoti he jis par aatankwaadi krityon main sanliptata kaa aarope he
 He said that Faheem Ansari and Sabauddin Ahmed, accused of preparing maps of the locations targeted during the 26 / 11 attacks, also deserve to be convicted for 'waging war against India'
 nikam ne kasaab ke ikbaalia bayaan kaa bhi sandarbh diya jisamen usne kaha tha ki 26 / 11 ke shadyantrkariyon ne hamalaavaron ko pakistan sthit ek prashikshan shivi main kaha tha ki ‘kashmir ko aaazaad karne kaa bharat sarkaar par dabaav daalane ke liye’ mumbai main aatankwaadi krityon ko anjaam diya jaye

 phir nyaayadhish em el tahiliyani ne use fatkaar lagaayi
 On his argument related to the charge of waging war against the country, Nikam further said that Kasab and others were instructed by the conspirators to kill American, Israeli and British citizens as the conspirators believed that these countries committed barbarism against Muslims is
 nikam ne hamalaavaron or unke pakistan sthit aakaaon ke bich telephone par hui baatcheet ke anshon kaa bhi sandarbh diya
 In this, the attackers were asked to kill Israeli civilians to spoil the friendly relations between India and Israel
 nikam ne kaha ki sunwaayee ke ant main kasaab kaa yah kahana jhooth kaa pulinda, mithyapurna bachaav or baad main sochakar kahi gayi baat he ki vah bharat main bataur pakistani paryatak aayaa tha or 26 / 11 ke hamalon ke samay vah police hiraasat main tha
 Nikam wondered why Kasab did not cross-examine three police officers who testified that he had caught Kasab alive from Girgaum Chowpatty on the night of the attacks when he was trying to escape in a car with another terrorist
 vishesh lok abhiyojak ne kaha ki kasaab unase jirah kar saktaa tha lekin usne aisa nahin kiya
 He defended himself as a thought later when the court was recording his statement after looking into the evidence
 unhone kaha ki hamalon ke samay police hiraasat main hone kaa kasaab kaa daawa bataur saboot pesh kii gayi uski tasveeron se bhi galat sabit hota he

 Bihars are troubled by irregular power supply in this summer season due to lack of adequate power supply from the central pool, while the problem of lighting up their homes in front of the people due to non-availability of kerosene after the center cut the allocation
 Has also occurred
 bihar ke khaadya evam upabhokta sangrakshan mantri shyaam rajak ne bataaya ki centre se bihar ko pehle hi aavashyaktaa se kam pratimah chah karod 93 lakh 28 hajaar litre kerosine aavanton ho rahaa tha
 But in the year 2009-10, it was further reduced to six crore 87 lakh 28 thousand liters per month
 bihar kii vartmaan main kerosine kii pratimah aavashyaktaa nau karod 30 lakh litre he
 Rajak said that on 23 February 2010, the Chief Minister of the state Nitish Kumar wrote a letter to the then Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Murali Deora in this regard and requested for a 34 percent increase in the kerosene allocation for Bihar
 unhone kaha ki lakshith jan vitaran pranali vyavastha lagu kiye jane ke baad desh ke vibhinn rajyon main garibi rekha se neeche rahane vaale :bipiel: pariwaron kii pahchaan or unki sankhya nirdhaarit karne kaa kaam shuru hua
 Razak said that in the past the work of this survey could not be completed either or it was blocked due to court orders, so in the year 2007, the state government conducted a fresh survey of poor families in the state
 bihar ke khaadya evam upabhokta mantri shyaam rajak ne bataaya ki is surveykshan ke praarambhik taur par uplabdh aankadon ke anusaar, rajya main garib pariwaron kii kul sankhya 1
 22 crores, about 2 of the total families
 23 karod tathaa parivaar ke sadasyon kii ausat sankhya 6
 4 down from 16
 38 pai gai
 He said that after the availability of these data, the State Government requested the Central Government not only to allocate foodgrains and kerosene in accordance with this increase but also through an all-party delegation, the Center was requested in this regard
 lekin centre sarkaar lagaataar yahi kahati rahi ki uske aankadon ke mutabik, rajya main maatr 65
 There are 2
3 million BPL families
 rajak ne kaha ki centre sarkaar apane aankadon ke bare main yah tark detii ai he ki iskaa aadhaar varsh 2000 kii aabaadi kaa anumaan or varsh 1994-95 main yojana ayog dwaara tay kiye gaye garibi ke anumaan han
 He said that the dependence of all the families of the state on kerosene is a well-known fact, yet it did not get the necessary allocation from the central government for all the families of the state, so as to allocate the beneficiary families in the year 2008 as per the allocation available to the state It became necessary to rationalize the amount of kerosene
 rajak ne kaha ki isi kram main rajya sarkaar na sabhi gramin pariwaron ko prati maah teen litre tathaa shahari pariwaron ko prati maah 2
 Decided to allocate 5 liters of kerosene
 unhone kaha ki rajya sarkaar kii yah maang rahi he ki kerosine ke aavanton main kam se kam 34 pratishat kii vruddhi kii jaae taaki rajya ke sabhi pariwaron ko upyukt maatra main kerosine uplabgh karaayaa ja sake
 Bihar's Food and Consumer Protection Minister Shyam Razak said that instead of taking a positive stance on the state government's request to increase the allocation of kerosene based on the total number of families in the state, the Center reduced the allocation of kerosene even further in the year 2009-10 From six million 87 lakh 28 thousand liters
 unhone kaha ki kendra sarkaar kerosine aavanton main kii gayi katautee ke bare main tark detii he ki rajya main alpiji vitaran main vruddhi ke uparaant kerosine kii maang main kami honi chahie or isi ko dhyaan main rakhkar yah katautee gayi he
 Rajak said that even in the case of LPG distribution in Bihar, it is a well-known fact that this growth in the state is very less compared to other states of the country
 unhone kaha ki bihar main alpiji kii vashirk uplabdhta prati vyakti rashtriya ausat 9
 Only 2 compared to 24 kg
 43 kilogram he jabaki praapt soochnanusaar gujarat, maharashtra evam dilli jaise rajyon main bijli evam alpiji kii ausat uplabdhta kaaphi hone ke baavjood janvitaran pranali ke tahat kerosine kii uplabdhta bihar kii tulana main kaaphi zyada he
 Its per capita per month availability in Delhi is around 20 liters
 rajak ne bataaya ki is bich varsh 2007 ke surveykshan ke uparaant aapattiyon ke niraakaran ke uparaant yah pataa chalaa ki bihar main pariwaron kii sankhya main or bhi vruddhi hui he
 Bihar's Food Consumer and Protection Minister Shyam Rajak said that the number of families living below the poverty line in Bihar is about 1
 37 karod tak pahunch chuki he or rajya main sampurna pariwaron kii sankhya 2
 45 crores approximately
 unhone kaha ki varsh 2007 ke surveykshan ke uparaant aapattiyon ke niraakaran ke baad yah bhi pataa chalaa ki rajya main pariwaron ke sadasyon ausat sankhya ab 3
 98, but the allocation of kerosene currently being received does not make it possible to retain the previously estimated amount of kerosene
 rajak ne bataaya ki par rajya ne prati vyakti anumaanyata ko barkaar rakhte hue ab rajya ke gramin pariwaron ko 2
 75 liters and 2 for urban families
 25 litre kerosine prati maah uplabdh karaayaa ja rahaa he
 He said that due to this attitude of the central government, all the families of the state are deprived of the facility of presumptive kerosene for them and the state government has been continuously opposing this system
 bihar ko kendriya pool se nirdhaarit 1772 megawatt bijli main se vartmaan main keval 1180 megawatt vidyut kii aapurti kii ja rahi he jabaki rajya kii aavashyaktaa kareeb teen hajaar megawatt kii he
 Due to low power supply from the central pool, Bihar State Electricity Board is feeling incapable of supplying power as far as the villages and even in cities
 bihar ke gramin kshetron main bijli uplabdhta kii baat karen to sarkari aankadon ke anusaar, pradesh ke 13048 gaanvon main bijli pahunch chuki he 23211 gaanv abhi bhi bijli se vanchit hai or unki puri tarah nirbharta kerosine par hi he

 Actor Aamir Khan, called Bollywood's 'mr
 Perfectionist', p Chidambaramatha, a leading minister of financial reforms in the country, and lawyer and human rights activist Vrinda Grover, has been included in the annual list of 100 influential people of the world by US famous magazine Time
 patrika ne aamir ko apane cover pej par jagah di he
 Time has divided this annual list released for the year 2013 into five parts - extraordinary individuals, leaders, artists, pioneers, icons (icons)
 patrika ne ‘pravartak’ shrenee main aamir khan, ‘pratik’ (aican) main ladakiyon kii shiksha kii pairokaar pakistani kaaryakarta malala usufji, ‘asaadhaaran vyakti’ shrenee main udhyami or kalakaar je jed, netaaon kii shrenee main america seenetter rand paul or kalakaaron kii shrenee main jenifer larens ko pehle sthaan par rakhaa he
 The magazine ranked Chidambaram in the category of 'extraordinary person'
 patrika main aamir khan ke bare main auskar puraskaar se sammanit mahaan sangeetkaar e aar rahamaan ne likhaa he
 Rahman wrote, 'in this world of false diplomacy and excuses, Aamir clearly speaks his point
 academy puraskaar ke liye namankit unki film ‘lagaan’ na keval vyavsaayik rup se safal hui balki unhone apni saamaajik jimmedaari ke bhav kaa bhi pradarshan kiya
 He raised important issues like poverty and education
 unka tivi sho ‘satyamev jayate’ patrakarita kaa hissaa he jisamen unhone yon shoshan se lekar jati aadhaarit bhedbhaav jaise bharat kii gambhirtam saamaajik buraaiyon ko uthaaya he
 Rehman said, 'aamir's magic worked
 satyamev jayate kaa uddeshy hal dhundhna nahin balki tikhe sawaal karnaa tha
 By daring to ask these questions, Aamir started a movement that would help change the world in which Indians live
 jai ho
 Regarding Chidambaram, Ruchir Sharma of Morgan Stanley writes, 'P Chidambaram's position is in many ways like that of a fish that has been removed from the water
 bhartiya netaa garam swabhaav ke or aspasht (vichaaron ke maamle main) hote hai
 They are backward and quite wrong in terms of time
 lekin chidambaram byoron par bahut dhyaan dete hai, subah aath baje se shaam aath baje tak kaam karte hai
 'he said,' His image is such that he does a lot of work but there is a snob in him because of that people make a wrong impression
 lekin unke achche kaam agle saal chunaav main ubhar kar aane vaali kamjor gathbandhan sarkaar ko ekajute rakhane ke maamle main shaayad paryaapt na ho
 Sharma said, "chidambaram is a trusted advocate of the Gandhi family in the Congress party
 unke anubhav kii andekhi nahin kii ja sakati he
 He said, "he was the Commerce Minister in the early years of the 1990s and played an important role at a time when India's economy was growing liberal
" vittamantri ke rup main 1997 main unhone ek nayi disha tay karne vaala bajet pesh kiya
 After this, his record of improvement remained mixed
 ’ sharma ne chidambaram ke bare main kaha, ‘vah pichley dashak main bhi vittamantri the jab bazaar main teji kaa daur tha
 The market is now getting soft
 bharat ke sheersh pad par pahunchane ke liye unhen apane desh kii aarthik kismat chamakaani padegi
 They also have to adopt a more Indian style
 patrika ne vrinda grover ke bare main likhaa, ‘vrinda ek maanavadhikaar kaaryakarta hai or mahilaon ke adhikaron ke liye kaam karti hai
 They believe that justice should reach everyone
 inamen ve log bhi shaamil hai jo ugravad prabhavit ilaakon main rahete hai, jinhen avaidh tareek se pratadit kiya jaataa he yaa jail bheja jaataa he
 Others on the list include US President Barack Obama, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Pope Francis, Myanmar's pro-democracy leader Aung Song Soo Chi, Michelle Obama and Chinese tennis player Li Na

 "the government has imposed 12 per cent GST on ghee," says Radheshyam Dixit, managing director of Noida-based Gopalji Dairy
 yahi kaaran he ki bahut sara milavati ghi bazaar main aa gaya he
 The government should keep milk products out of the purview of tax, so that branded products can reach more and more people
 '' milavati utpaada branded kii tulana main bahut saste hote hai
 Also, the entire unorganized market is exempt from the tax net
 iske alaava milavati utpaada swasthya ke liye bhi behad hanikaarak hote hai

 The company's managing director Vinod Dutt says, "we used to buy 3 lakh liters of milk daily in the peak season

 At present, daily purchase of 1

 khanna kehete hai, "desh main milk powder kaa stock ikattha hone kii vajah antarrashtriya bazaar main doodh kii keemten krash ho janaa he
 The current price of milk powder in the global market is 135 to 140 rupees per kg whereas in India the cost of milk powder is 180 to 190 rupees per kg
 lihaaja, pichley 3 saal se sust pade export se hi darasal milk powder kaa yah stock khadaa ho gaya
 In April 2013, milk prices were at their highest level in the global market at $ 5,142 per tonne, which in July 2014 averaged $ 3,516
 2015 se 2018 ke dauraan yahi keemten 1,700 se 2,000 dollar prati ton ke aasapaas rahi hai
 This crash of the global market has hurt the profits of Indian dairy companies
 yahaan nahin asardesh kii sabase badi privet deyari hatsan agro products ke chairman aar ji chandramogam kehete hai, "desh main schimd milk powder kaa stock hone se un companiyon par zyada asar padaa he jinke bijness main bada hissaa powder milk kaa he
 Companies whose business depends on products like milk, curd, buttermilk and ghee have less impact
 '' darasal, doodh main darasal teen padaarth hote hai
 First fat, second solid not fat (SNF) and third water
 companiyaan liquid milk ko process kar band packet doodh or dahi banaakar bech detii hai
 After this, products like cream, butter and ghee are made from the fat part
 vahiin esanef main se pani ko sokh kar schimd milk powder main tabdeel kar diya jaataa he
 The powder has more margins
 isliye companiyaan flush sijan (jab doodh kaa utpaadan zyada hota he) main milk powder bana leti hai, jisko leen sijan main istemaal ke saath export bhi karti hai
 Milk can be kept as a powder for a long time
 chandramogam bataate hai, "hatsan kaa bada bijness doodh or dahi se aata he
 This is the reason why at this time the company is also procuring three million liters of milk daily, which is about 27 last year
 5 lakh litre tha

 "there are many products coming in the market that the public considers milk products, but if you read the material written in fine letters, then you will find it has nothing to do with milk

 Khanna says, "to get out of the current crisis, the government should take stock of milk powder from the market
 iskaa istemaal africa jaise deshon main donneton ke taur par kiya ja saktaa he
 Also, divide it in schemes like Mid-day meal in the country
 isse ek taraf bazaar main keemten sudharne se kisaan ko raahat milegi or duusari taraf desh kii badi aabaadi tandurust hogi
 Governments in developed countries take products like milk products from the market to support the farmers
 ham vikasshil hokar aisa kyon nahin kar sakate
 Also, for this permanent solution, the government will have to increase the processing capacity
 ''vahiin sodhi kehete hai, "desh se deyari product ke niryaat main kuch sudhaar aayaa he
 Foreign consumers are also gaining confidence in our products
 lekin doodh ke export kaa bada bazaar mexico, malaysia, rus or china jaise deshon main hai
 Exports of Indian products are not allowed in these countries right now
 is disha main kaam karne kii jarurat he
 "sardana says," The government can eliminate existing stock by subsidizing exporters
 isse bazaar se doodh kaa stock khatm ho jayega or niryaat ko badhaava milegaa
 The government can provide immediate relief by subsidizing farmers or purchasing milk powder, but long-term solutions have to be found for a permanent solution

 kaam ke tanaav se jujh rahi mumbai police main beemaari se marane waalon kaa salanaa ausat 150 ke kareeb he
 But recently some incidents which have embarrassed the Mumbai Police have made the police think
 jaise- - Vakola police station senior police inspector was shot dead by the ASI of the same police station and then committed suicide

 puri jaankaree gupt rakhi jaaegi, isliye hamaari apil he ki sabhi pulicekarmi sabhi sawaalon kaa sahi jawaab den
 For this, separate teams of psychiatrists have been formed by the police, who will also review these information and also counseling the concerned policemen if needed

 sabase bada sawaal ye uthaa ki aakhir kaise koi chandani chowk metro stesan se suraksha jaanch ke baad bhi hathiyaar lekar metro stesan ke andar daakhil ho gaya
 The CISF had asked for an internal inquiry into the matter

 💃💃💃 # balleballea photo posted by Neha Dhupia (@nehadhupia) ondec 5, 2016 at 2:14 pm PST siyaasi partiyaan mahila shashaktikaran ke badi-badi baaten to karti hai, lekin ve mahilaon ko vastav main shashakt banane ke liye shaayad hi kuch karti hai
 Women constitute almost half of the total population of the country, yet the percentage of women participation in power is very poor
 india today kii data intelegence unit (DIU) ne paaya ki apane kharaab linganupaat ke liye kukhyat haryana ke chunaav main kismat aajamaa rahe pratyaashiyon main mahilaon kii sankhya pichley chunaav ke mukaable ghat gai he
 Anyway, female representation in Haryana politics is already very low
 2019 kahryana vidhansabha chunaavalad rahe pratyaashiyon ke halafname ke aadhaar par aankadon kaa vishleshan karne par diaiu ne paaya ki 2014 ke chunaav main jahaan 116 mahilaon ne chunaav ladaa tha, vahiin 2019 main 108 mahilaayein hi chunaav lard rahi hai
 However, if we look at the percentage, it has increased from 9 percent in 2014 to 10 percent in 2019, but this is because the number of men contesting elections has also come down from 1235 to 1061
 badi partiyon ne kam tikat diehalanki, haryana main badi partiyon ne kai jaani-maani mahila shakhsiyaton ko tikat diya he, jinamein sport star babitha phogot se lekar tiktaoc sansani sonaali phogot tak shaamil hai, lekin raajnneeti main mahilaon kii bhagidaari or shashaktikaran ke lihaaj se yah sankhya bahut kam he
 The Haryana Assembly has 90 seats and only five parties are contesting more than 80 seats
 The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is contesting all 90 seats and has given tickets to only 12 women
 2014 main bijepi ne 15 mahilaon ko tikat diya tha
 Similarly, bjp's biggest rival Congress gave ticket to 10 women in the last assembly elections and without any change in this number, this time also gave ticket to 10 women
 indian neshnal lokdal, jo ki haryana kii ek ahm party he, isane badi partiyon main sabase zyada mahila pratyaashiyon ko utaara he
 This time the party has given tickets to 15 women
 pichley chunaav main isane 16 mahilaon ko maidan main utaara tha
 This election marks the first entry of Jananayak Janata Party (JJP) in Haryana
 yah party pichley saal indian neshnal lokdal ke tuutane ke baad vajood main ai he
 The JJP is contesting a total of 88 seats and has fielded 7 women candidates
 mayawati kii bahujan samaaj party (basapa) kul 82 siton par chunaav lard rahi hai jisamen se sirf 6 mahilaayein hai
 The BSP had also given tickets to 6 women last time
 nirdaleey mahila pratyaashiyon kii sankhya bhi ghatiaisa nahin he ki sirf badi raajnneetik partiyon ne hi mahilaon ko kam sankhya main pratyaashee banaaya he, balki nirdaleey chunaav ladane vaali mahilaon kii sankhya bhi pichley chunaav ke mukaable ghati he
 a total of 33 women contested the Independence elections in the 2014 Haryana Assembly elections, while this time only 25 women are contesting as independents
 siten jahaan ek bhi mahila nahinharyana kii sabhi 90 siton par purush pratyaashee chunavi maidan main taal thonk rahe hai, lekin haryana main kai aisi siten hai jahaan par ek bhi mahila pratyaashee nahin he
 In the 2014 elections, there were 23 seats in which there was not a single woman candidate
 2019 ke chunaav main yah sankhya badhkar 32 ho gai he
 That is, in Haryana Assembly elections 2019, there is not a single female candidate in 32 seats out of 90
 dakshin bharat main janata kaa netaaon ko samarthan kai baar deewangi kii had paar kar jaataa he
 This madness about the late Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu Jayalalithaa increases even more
 unhen aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle main 2014 main jail kii sajaa hui thi, lekin adaalat ke faisle ke baad unhone 2015 main ek baar phir mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee or yahaan tak kii 2016 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main lagaataar duusari baar sattashin hokar tamilnadu ke 32 saal puraane record ko todaa
 According to the Anna DMK party, earlier 244 people had committed suicide after being saddened by their going to jail
 inke parijanon ko baad main muaavja bhi diya gaya
 Now that Jayalalithaa is no more, how her supporters take it will be a matter to be seen! This is not the first example from South Indian states
 tamilnadu is maamle main hameshaa top par rahata he
 Not only Jayalalithaa, supporters of Karunanidhi are so disheartened by their leaders that they commit suicide
 aisa bhi nahin ki jayalalita yaa anya koi netaa in pariwaron ko nijee taur par jaanate, pahachaanate honge
 It also cannot be assumed that due to these, the standard of living of those families has increased a lot
 prashasan yahaan bhi saamaanya rup se chalata he
 Therefore, in every election there is a series of defeats and wins
 yah bhi nahin mana ja saktaa ki dakshin bharat ke logon main apane netaa ke prati bahut deewangi hoti he, isliye saikadon log apane netaa kii pareshaani dekh nahin pate
 If this is true, then why do the people of the poor often commit suicide
 in netaaon kii kripaase pad tathaa anya aarthik laabh uthaane vaale dakshin bhartiya hone ke baavjood aisa kadam nahin uthaate
 Even the ministers and relatives of his government remain restrained in spite of natural suffering
 phir sudur gaanv main rahane vaala jaan kyon de detaa he
 This is beyond comprehension
 kuch saal pehle andhra pradesh ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri vaai es rajasekhar reddy kaa helicopter durghatana main nidhan hua
 Many suicides were also reported from that time, while his son Jagan Mohan himself was preparing to take political succession
 apane pita kii antim yatra main vah khule vaahan par sabakaa abhivadan karte chal rahe the
 a few days later, he claimed the post of Chief Minister
 ye baat alag he ki congress haikaman ne ise manjuur nahin kiya tha
 Jaganmohan was also disappointed
 lekin aatmahatya karne vaale adhikansh log aise the, jin par ‘kou nrip hoi hamein kaa haani cheri chhaadi ab hob kii rani’ charitaarth hota tha
 In such a situation, it is a matter of research why the poor are so distracted
 ise dakshin bharat kii ek visheshta kaise mana ja saktaa he, yadi yah baat sach hoti to satta se labhanvit yaa raajnneetik uttaradhikari isse prabhavit kyon nahin hote
 Whatever it is, whether rich or poor, the actual test of a person takes place in an emergency
 apane netri ke aakasmik nidhan ke vakt unke samarthakon ko dhairya rakhane kii aavashyaktaa he
 On such occasions it becomes a special responsibility of the society to increase the morale of the people by communicating restraint, harmony, harmony and strength
 vakt he manthan kaa, jayalalita kaa uttaradhikari talashne kaa
 In this case, be patient and do not do anything that causes loss of value
 isse pehle scymet ne apane purvanumaan main kaha tha ki monsoon 28 may ko kerala main pravesh karegaa jabaki iemdi kaa anumaan tha ki monsoon 29 may ko dastak degaa
 Additional Director General of IMD Mrityunjay Mohapatra said that the monsoon is expected to reach Kerala in the next 24 hours
 mausam vibhaag ke mutabik , yadi 10 may ke baad , kerala main sthapit 14 mausam nigaraanee kendron main se 60 pratishat main lagaataar do din 2
 If rainfall of 5 mm or more is recorded for two consecutive days, then the monsoon entry into Kerala can be announced on the second day
 yah monsoon aane ke mukhya mandandon main se ek he
 According to the Meteorological Department, if after 10 May, 60 per cent of the 14 weather monitoring centers set up in Kerala have two consecutive days for 2 days
 5 mili meter yaa usase adhik kii varsha lagaataar do din tak darj kii jaati he , to duusare din kerala main monsoon ke pravesh kii ghoshnaa kii ja sakati he
 This is one of the main criteria for the arrival of monsoon
 financial ection task force (FATF) dwaara pakistan ko blaclist karne yaa nahin karne ko lekar faisla kiye jane se pehle america ne kaha he ki pakistan ko aatankwaadi guton ko apni dharti kaa istemaal karne se rokna hoga, or lashkar-e-taiyaba ke sargana hafiz said samet gut ke sheersh oparativon ko dandit karnaa hoga
 Alice Wells, head of the South and Central Asian Bureau of the US State Department, also welcomed the arrest of four top lashkar-e-taiba (let) / jamaat-ud-dawa (jud) members in Pakistan
 pakistan kii kanoon evam vyavastha ke liye uttaradaayi agenciyon ne guuruuvaar ko pratibandhit let / jud ke 'chaar sheersh sadasyon' ko aatankwaad ko vitt poshan dene ke aarope main giraftaar kiya he
 The four terrorists have been identified as Professor Zafar Iqbal, Yahya Aziz, Mohammad Ashraf and Abdul Salam
 elice wales ne twit kiya, "jaisaa (pakistan ke) pradhanmantri imran khan ne kaha he, pakistan ko, apane hi mustakabil ke liye, aatankwaadi guton ko apni dharti kaa istemaal karne se rokna hi hoga
 
 
 "he said," We welcome the news that Pakistan has arrested four let members
 
 
 let ke krur hamalon ke peediton ko haq he ki ve in logon ko let ke sargana hafiz said ke saath sazaa milti dekhen
 
 
 "pakistan has a long history of arresting and releasing terrorists operating from its soil
 wales kii tippanee aise samay main ai he, jab FATF pakistan ke 'grey list' states par faisla karne ja rahi he
 The FATF, which operates from Paris, put Pakistan on the gray list in June last year, and also gave an action plan to complete by October 2019, or else it would be threatened with being blacklisted with Iran and North Korea
 Have to face
 aatankwaad ke khilaaf pakistan ke pradarshan kii samiksha main tay hoga ki vah grey list main bana rahegaa, yaa use blaclist kar diya jayega, yaa use clin chit de di jaaegi
 Alice Wells had last month also asked Pakistan to punish militants such as Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar, and also said that pakistan-india was seriously interested in taking action against those involved in cross-border terrorism
 Decreasing the tension between the two will depend
 pakistan ke pradarshan kii 12 oktober se 15 oktober tak chalane vaali samiksha yah tay karegi ki islamabad grey suchi main rahata he yaa use kaali suchi main daal diya jaataa he yaa clin chit de di jaati he
 Wales had also asked Pakistan last month to prosecute terrorists like Saeed and Masood Azhar
 unhone kaha tha ki bharat or pakistan ke bich tanaav kam hona is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki islamabad ‘‘seemaa paar ghuspaith'' main shaamil logon ke khilaaf karrwai ko lekar kitna gambhir he
 Tensions between India and Pakistan have increased since the Indian government's August decision to revoke special state status in Jammu and Kashmir
 bharat ke is faisle kaa pakistan ne kadaa virodh kiya he
 It has curtailed diplomatic relations with India and expelled the Indian ambassador
 pakistan jammu-kashmir ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene vaale samvidhan ke anuchhed 370 ke praavdhaanon ko nirast karne ke baad se kashmir maamle kaa antarrashtriyakaran karne kii koshish kar rahaa he lekin nayi dilli ne jor dekar kaha he ki anuchhed 370 uskaa aantarik maamla he
 The US Finance Ministry has named Saeed a global terrorist and has announced a reward of one million dollars for his informer
 aisa mana jaataa he ki said ke netritv vaala jamaat-ud-daawa lashkar kaa vah mukhya sanghathan tha jisane 2008 ke mumbai hamalon ko anjaam diya tha
 166 people were killed in this attack
 pich par aate hi bolers kii dhunaai ke liye mashhoor shahid afridi apane phens ke bich boom-boom ke naam se to team ke saathi khilaadiyon ke bich lala ke naam se jane jate hai
 Afridi was a favorite of cricket lovers in many countries, including Pakistan, but India, because of his aggressive batting and the demolition of many world records of cricket
 1 march ko afridi 37 saal ke ho jaaenge
 But before that, he has now said goodbye to international cricket
 aaie jaanate hai unke kuch khaas record-1
 Shahid Afridi holds the record for fastest century in ODI cricket for more than 16 years
 srilanka ke khilaaf 1996 main unhone keval 37 gendon par yah record banaaya
 Later, Corey Anderson broke Afridi's record by doing this feat off 36 balls
 haalanki 18 janvari 2015 ko abi divilliars ne keval 31 gendon par yah record bade antar se apane naam kar liya he
 Afridi is still at number three on this list
 2
 Afridi hit the most sixes in odis
 unke naam 351 chakke darj hai
 Sanath Jayasuriya is named at number two with 270 sixes
 kris gail 238 chhakkon ke saath tisare, jabaki mahendra singh dhoni makkulam 204 chhakkon ke saath chauthe sthaan par hai
 3
 pichley lagbhag 21 saalon se shahid afridi vanade cricket main shatak jadne vaale sabase yuva cricketrs kii list kaa netritv kar rahe hai
 He scored 102 against Sri Lanka on 4 October 1996 at the age of only 16 years 217 days
 bana kar pakistan ke hi saleem ilaahi ko peeche choda
 Currently Usman Gani of Afghanistan is the youngest batsman to score a century in 17 years 242 days after Afridi
 4
 In the 2014 Asia Cup, Afridi scored a half-century off just 18 balls with the help of six sixes
 yah teesraa mauka tha, jab afridi ne keval 18 gendon par ardhashatak jadaa
 However, the record of the fastest half-century in odis is recorded in the name of de Villiers (16 balls)
 5
 Afridi also holds the record for the biggest six in terms of distance
 unhone johnisburg vanade main dakshin africa ke khilaaf 17 march 2013 ko 48 gendon par 88 ran banaae
 During this, he hit seven sixes, one of which went up to 158 meters
 6
 The Pakistani cricketer who won the most man of the match is Shahid Afridi
 unhen unke shandaar pradarshan ke liye 32 baar yah puraskaar mil chukaa he
 However, he is number 5 in this list in terms of world record
 7
 Among the cricketers who have scored more than 1000 runs in odis, Shahid Afridi's strike rate is also more than any Pakistan cricketer
 afridi ne 398 match main 117 kii strike rate ke saath 8064 ran banaae hai
 No other Pakistani cricketer is anywhere near him
