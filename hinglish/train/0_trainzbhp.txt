 The story of this four-day-old newborn who was miraculously alive in the army's rescue operations in flood-ravaged Jammu and Kashmir tells both hope and despair
 is navjaat ko srinagar main jibi pant aspataal ke sunsaan or ujaad bal chikitsa ikai se bachaaya gaya
 When it was rescued with another 300 children, the doctors could not find its family doctors anywhere
 aaj kisi ko bhi nahin pataa ki iskaa naam kya he or koi ise lene aayega bhi yaa nahin
 Army doctor Brigadier NS Lamba told NDTV, "unless there are no relatives of this child then it will remain here
" ' At the moment, this newborn is safe, but if its family is not known, then it is very difficult to tell what will happen next
 jab sena ne jibi pant aspataal main bachaav kaa kaam shuru kiya to sena kii praathamikta pehle bacchon ko bachaana tha, phir mahilaayein or aakhir main purushon ko
 Because of this, the army has not yet ascertained whether the child's father has died or that he is trapped and safe somewhere
 raahat kii baat he ki yah maasoom baccha swasth he
 This newborn has been successful in defeating catastrophe and death
 lekin sena jaanati he ki vah bachche ko hameshaa apane saath nahin rakh sakati he
 So in this ICU, the only question is whether this child will ever be able to go home
 insaani laaparvaahee kii vajah se behad bhayaavah bani is prakritik aapadaa main sabase zyada prabhavit kashmir ke maasoom bachche hue hai
 Even if their life is saved, there is a possibility that they may not be able to recover everything
 
 Like this four-day-old newborn who is waiting for a family that he can call his own

 The Delhi Medical Council has completed its investigation into the death of the child due to negligence at Max Hospital
 jaanch main doctoron ko doshi nahin paaya gaya
 The council has given a clean chit to the doctors after investigation
 ek jinda bachche ko maiks hospital shalimaar baag dwaara mrit ghoshit kiya tha or pack karke maa-baap ko de diya gaya tha jiske baad aspataal kaa license bhi dilli sarkaar ne cancil kiya tha
 The case came to light in December last year
 maiks aspataal main judawaan bacchon ko kathith rup se mrit ghoshit karne ke maamle ko dekh rahi dilli chikitsa parishad ( diemasi ) ne aspataal ko clin chit dete hue kaha he ki uski taraf se koi bhi chikitsakeey laaparvaahee nahin hui he
 In its report to the crime branch of the Delhi Police investigating the case, the DMC said that the hospital had not issued the death certificate to the child whose heart had been beating for four-five hours, as the family had 'don't Resuscitate' (DNR) documents i
e
 papers not revived were signed
 haalanki doctoron ne pun: hosh main laane kii prakriya ko lekar salaah di thi
 Joint Commissioner of Police of Crime Branch Alok Kumar has confirmed that he has received the report from DMC and said that they will study it
 tippaniyan The DMC recorded statements of the child's family members and doctors and staff
 diemasi ne kaha ki prakriyaagat khamiyaan thi or aparyaapt dastavejikaran tha jo shaayad aise maamalon ko dekhne ke dauraan uchit disha - nirdesh nahin hone kii vajah se he
 According to the DMC report, doctors at Max Super Specialty Hospital cannot be held responsible for medical lapses in treatment given to the complainant's newborn son
 is aspataal ne pichley saal 30 november ko janm ke baad ek bachche ko kathith rup se galat tareeke se mrit ghoshat kar diya tha
 However the child was alive and died a week later while undergoing treatment at a nursing home in Pitampura
 vahiin uski judawaan bahan mrit paidaa hui thi
 These children were born at a 23-week pregnancy
 (input bhashaa se bhi) a live child was declared dead by Max Hospital Shalimar Bagh and packed and given to the parents, after which the license of the hospital was also canceled by the Delhi government

 The Delhi Medical Council (DMC), which is looking into the matter of allegedly declaring the twins dead at Max Hospital, has given a clean chit to the hospital saying that there has been no medical negligence on its part
 maamle kii jaanch kar rahi dilli police kii aparaadh shakha ko di apni report main diemasi ne kaha ki aspataal ne us bachche ko mrityu pramaan patr jari nahin kiya tha jiskaa dil chaar-paanch ghante tak dhadkta rahaa tha, kyonki parivaar ne ‘du note rissitat ’(dianar ) dastavej yani punerjeevit nahin karne vaale kagajaat par hastakshar kiye the
 However, doctors had advised about the process of regaining consciousness
 aparaadh shakha ke sanyukt police ayukta alok kumaar ne pushti kii he ki unhen diemasi se report mili he or kaha ki ve iskaa adhyayan karenge
 The comments diemasi ne bachche ke parivaar ke sadasyon or doctoron tathaa staff ke bayaan darj kiye
 The DMC said that there were procedural lapses and insufficient documentation which is probably due to lack of proper guidelines while looking into such cases

 in se saabhaar) No one is taught to lie
 kai vajahon se yah aadat khud-ba-khud hi ban jaati he
 It is easiest to lie to hide mistakes
 haalanki bachche ko shuru main hi is aadat se dur kar diya jaae to aage chalakar zyada pareshaani nahin hogi
 For this, it is very important that the parents catch the lie of the child and intercept it
 haalanki bachche bahut saavdhaanee se jhooth baalate hai lekinap chahen to in baton ko aadhaar banaakar apane bachche ke jhooth ko aasaani se pakadsakate hai:1
 When children tell lies, they are unable to match their parents' eyes
 agar aapkaa baccha aapse ankhen churaakar baaten karata he to aapke liye yah sanbhalane kaa vakt he
 2
 bachche jab jhooth bolte hai tove ek hi baat ko baar-baar doharaate hai
 They think that by saying the same thing again and again, their false words will also be found to be true
 3

 4
 Getting stuck repeatedly while talking is also a sign of lying
 5
 If your child is blinking eyelids repeatedly while talking and is making excessive gestures, then understand that he is lying

 congress ne uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke prayek sthaayee kaaryakarta ke parivaar ke ek sadsy ko sarkari naukari dene kii ghoshnaa ko bhraamak or kori bayaanbaji qaraar dete hue ise puri tarah sanvaidhanik prakriya ke viruddh bataaya he
 a senior cabinet minister of the state, Shivpal Singh Yadav, announced this on Wednesday
 uttar pradesh congress cameti ke pravaktaa maruf khan ne guuruuvaar ko samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki janata sapa kii in thothi ghoshnaaon ko samaj chuki he, yahi kaaran he ki sabhi jilon main uske kaaryakarta ab rajya sarkaar ke viruddh lamaband ho rahe hai
 In such a situation, by realizing its slipping mass base and continuously losing credibility, the SP has left a shigufa which is not possible to fulfill because the constitutional process has to be completed to give a government job
 khan ne kaha ki aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav ko dhyaan main rakhkar sapa ke netaa ek baar phir apane chhitak rahe kaaryakartaaon ko sarkari naukari kaa pralobhan de rahe hai, jo puri tarah dhokhaa he
 He said that making such a declaration by senior SP leader and the state minister's strong minister to his party workers is also completely against the constitutional process

 Pathrabay, however, said that the students 'tortured' him during the siege and that the footage he distributed was a 'selective leak' to suppress the truth

 On April 1, the first meeting of the UP bjp's working committee was being held in Lucknow's City Montessori School campus in an election year
 vahaan yah samaj main aa gaya ki party main sab saamaanya nahin chal rahaa he
 Its hallmark was seen when Lucknow MP and Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh did not appear in the meeting
 jabaki kaarykram vaale din hi ve apane teen divasiy daure par lakhanu pahunch gaye the
 The question arises that when the local mps participated extensively in all the previous meetings of the Working Committee, then why did the Lucknow MP keep the distance? If Rajnath Singh was busy with any other program, then why was the Working Committee meeting not decided according to his availability, even though he was in Lucknow the next day? It was clear that Rajnath's picture was not with the big leaders even in the auditorium of the venue
 It was that the party which talked of collectivism has deviated from its policy
 baat yaheen khatm nahin hui
 On the day of the event, the state BJP spokesperson came at night

 Singh grew up on Facebook, 'what happened if a tree dates like a tree
' panthi ko chaaya nahin fal laage ati dur' jaisaa kabir kaa doha likhakar ishaaron-ishaaron main rajnath singh par hamalaa bol diya
 He told India Today that he is distressed by Rajnath's absence in the meeting of the State Working Committee

 '' party netaa lakh safai den, is puure prakaran ne upi bijepi main netaaon kii khemebaaji ko hawa de di he
 The result of this well-known disease of the party is that the party has not been able to elect a new state president in UP for four months
 isiilie baithak main bhi sapa sarkaar ke khilaaf kisi majboot andolan kii ruparekha taiyaar nahin ho saki
 The major opposition parties who have defeated the saffron party in the Lok Sabha elections have declared their candidates and have stood in the fray in the assembly elections, while the party claiming to be the world's largest party is sweating in choosing the state president

 In fact, the biggest challenge before the BJP leadership is to choose the face from the state that is trusted by UP BJP in-charge Om Mathur, National President Amit Shah and Home Minister Rajnath Singh

 During the BJP State Working Committee meeting held on 1 April, the prominence with pictures of Manoj Sinha in the hoardings installed at the venue indicated that the workers and leaders had lost the intention of the BJP leadership

 The BJP may not have been able to prepare to win the next assembly election, but controversy has arisen in many places due to big leaders claiming the chief minister's post

 pradhanmantri narendra modi aaj (ravivaar) rajkot,kachchauranandjile ke daure par hai
 PM Modi in Anand inaugurated Amul dairy plant
 iske baad piem modirajkotke alfred hai skool main navnirmit mahatma gandhi museum kaa udghaatan bhi karenge
 Please tell that Mahatma Gandhi took the matriculation examination from this school in 1887
 aazaadee ke baad is skool kaa naam badalakar mohandas gandhi hiskool rakh diya gaya tha
 It was closed in 2017 by the authorities for the purpose of turning it into a museum
 updates-piem modi ne kaha ki aaj samay aa gaya he ki ham navonmesh or mulya sanvardhan ko mahatta den
 There was a time in our country when we lived under the influence of scarcity
 tab shashan kii nirnay prakriya alag hua karte the
 Today, we do not face a crisis of lack, today the challenge within the country is immense
 - piem modi ne kaha, maine gujarat kii bahut si dereiyon ko kaha he ki vah mithi kranti par bhi kaam karen, jo madhumakhiyon se sambandhit he
 i know that Banas Dairy and Amreli Dairy have done commendable work in this direction
 main or deyari se isapar dhyaan dene ke liye aagrah karata hum
 - PM said, we are doing very well in milk processing but we can do better than this
 mujhe puri vishwaas he ki ham is disha main sochenge
 It will definitely be quick
 - piem ne kaha, ham jan dhan, van dhan or gobar dhan par dhyaan kendrit kar rahe hai
 This will help the farmers
 kuch samay pehle main kuccha gaya or vahaan oont ke doodh ko lokapriy karne kii aavashyaktaa ke bare main baat kii
 At that time a group of people made fun of me
 lekin aaj oont ke doodh vaali amul chocolate kaaphi lokapriy he
 - PM Modi said, for a long time, we have some people sitting in Gandhinagar who dislike cooperatives
 unhone is kshetra ko saurashtra main pakad hasil karne se roka
 - PM said, not only Amul but also people of North Gujarat have worked in the cooperative sector
 hamaare paas banaas deyari, dudhsagar deyari he
 All these efforts particularly helped the farmers in Gujarat
 - pradhanmantri ne kaha, sardaar patel dwaara nirdeshit pritmaray desai ji ne ahmedabad main bade paimaane par sahakaari awaas par kaam kiya
 These efforts gave wings to the aspirations of many people
 - piem modi ne kaha, ek dashak pehle sardaar patel raajnneeti main shaamil hue the
 He won from Dariyapur
 unhen keval ek vot se jeet mili thi
 When he took office in the Municipal Corporation, he emphasized urban development, planning and worked on cooperative housing
 - piem ne kaha, sardaar jaise mahapurushon ne us beej ko boyaa jo aaj teesri arthvyavastha kaa namoona ban ke ubhara he jahaan na sarkaar kaa kabza hoga na dhanna sethon kaa kabza hoga wo sahakaarita andolan hoga, kisaanon nagarikon kii sahakaarita se wo vyavastha badhegi or har koi uskaa hissedaar hoga
 - PM Modi said, today Amul has become an inspiration all over the world
 videshon ke log bhi mujhase amul ke bare main poochhate hai
 Amul is not only milk processing but it has become an excellent model of empowerment
 - piem modi ne kaha, aanand ke log hamen aashirwad dene ke liye itani badi sankhya main aae hai
 i thank them for the warmth and love
 aaj 1100 karod rupee kii vikasshil pariyojnaon kaa yaa to udghaatan hua he yaa phir unki neenv rakhi gai he

 Narendra Modi's big promise during the Lok Sabha election campaign was to bring back black money stashed abroad
 pradhanmantri kii kursi sanbhaalane ke baad bhi modi kai baar kehete rahe ki is chupe dhan se desh main vikaas kii tasviir badal sakati he or aarthik vruddhi kii gati tej ho sakati he
 He also had to face sharp attacks in Parliament when the Opposition took him in the winter session for not keeping his promise
 so, satta sanbhaalane ke das maheene baad kendriya cabinet ne 20 march ko desh ke khoe dhan ko waapas laane ke makasad se ek nae vidheyak ko manjuuri di
 But as soon as the undisclosed Foreign Income and Property (taxation) Bill, 2015 (UFIAIT) was introduced in the Parliament, its criticisms were more intense
 udyog jagat se lekar tamaam logon ko is vidheyak main jo baat sabase adhik khatak rahi he, vah he isamen iskar vibhaag, pravartan nideshaalay (idi), kendriya pratyakshkar board (sibiditi) or anya vibhaagon ko die gaye nirankush adhikaar
 Assessing officers have also been given certain judicial powers under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CRPC)
 yahi nahin, kuch niyam or prakriyaaon main vyakhya kii gunjaaish bhi chhod di gai he
 Apart from this, avenues have also been opened for one person to run a variety of cases for the same crime
 kar yogya aamadani ko chupaana aam taur par divaani maamla mana jaataa he lekin kaledhan ke is vidheyak ne videshon main jamaa aghoshit dhan ko aparaadh kii shrenee main daalkar faujadaari maamla bana diya he
 M
, a member of the White Paper Mazmoon Committee of the Finance Ministry and former chairman of CBDT
 si
 According to Joshi, the suggestion to make it a criminal offense came from the Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted by the Modi government on the directions of the Supreme Court to monitor black money cases
 vidheyak main ek praavdhaan kaale dhan ko privension of mani landring act (piemele) ke tahat soochibaddh aparaadh kii shrenee main rakhane kaa he
 This means that as soon as the authorities come to know the unaccounted assets deposited abroad or the source of earnings, action will be initiated under the PMLA law
 yah kaaphi kadaa kanoon he or ise amuman maadak padaarthon or hathiyaaron kii taskari jaise sangeen aparaadhon ke maamalon main amal main laayaa jaataa he
 According to Finance Ministry sources, one of the motives for bringing black money stashed abroad under the PMLA law and placing it in the category of crime is an attempt to get information from abroad
 agar aparaadhikta na judi ho to amuman bank or sarkari adhikari doharaa karadhaan nishedh sandhiyon ke praavdhaanon ke tahat suchanaaen saajha karne ko taiyaar nahin hote
 However, former CBDT member S
 es
 "the new proposed law will not open new doors for getting information or evidence (about black money stashed abroad)," says Khan
 iske liye adhikariyon ko doharaa karadhaan nishedh sandhiyon or kar soochna vinimay samjhauton par hi ashrith rahanaa hoga
 Shailendra Kumar, a tax expert and editor of Taxindia Online
com, says that the government's seriousness has been shown by bringing black money under a stringent law like PMLA in India for the first time, considering the language and sentiments of the provisions of the bill
 haalanki jaankaron ko ashanka he ki is kanoon ke aakaar lene ke baad kar vyavastha main inspector raaj kii vaapasi ho jaaegi
 The main reason for this is that the bill proposes to build a comprehensive legal machinery for tax assessment, investigation and appeal (commissioner, Arbitration, High Court or Supreme Court)
 yahi mashinari jurmaana thokane, adaalaton main mukadmaa chalaane or kar ugaahne kaa kaam karegi
 It is altogether a new form of the same system that many people have been facing in the earlier phase of oppressive economic liberalization
 yahi nahin, is vidheyak ke mutabik kar vanchanaa ke aarope main uljhi kisi company ke kaarobaar ke har jikvamedaar or prabharee ko doshi mana jayega
 This practically means that not only the owner of the company, but all the top executives of the company will be entitled to legal action and punishment
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki prastaavit kanoon ke tahat ek hi varsh main kisi vyakti ke khilaaf anek tarah kii kanoonee prakriyaayein chal sakati hai
 If the provisions of two different laws are merged in a case, it may have to face two types of tax assessments as well as two types of appeals process, penal procedure and litigation
 iske saath hi us par idi piemele kanoon ke tahat alag se karrwai kar saktaa he
 Says Somesh Arora, head of tax expert and consultant firm Amicus Raras, "it makes no sense to link this bill (the Black Money Bill) to the PMLA because there are stringent tax collection provisions in the bill
" iske alaava ek khaas str ke baad kar akalan kii rakam jamaa karne ke baad hi koi apil main ja saktaa he
 Arora says that there are thousands of cases for which the ED does not have a way to investigate and take action
 ve kehete hai, ''aparaadh kii vittiya seemaa spasht kiye bina piemele kanoon ko or kanoonon ke saath kyon joda jaae? yah to vaisaa hi hua ki faansee ke fande ke aakaar ke hisaab se kisi kaa galaa dhundh liya jaae
 '' But Finance Ministry spokesman D
 es
 Malik says that the bill is not very strict as it has taken various measures to prevent abuse
 unhone india today ke i-mail ke jawaab main kaha, ''prakritik nyaay or kanoonee prakriya ke anupaalan kaa khyaal rakhkar vidheyak main aaropee vyakti ke khilaaf karrwai shuru karne ke pehle notice dene ke praavdhaan ko anivaary banaaya gaya he
 According to him, the proposed law provided that every suspect would be given a chance to be heard and present evidence
 durupyog ko rokane ke liye har vajah kii ricarding, likhit main aadesh dene or samay seemaa ke bheetar karrwai karne jaise praavdhaan kiye gaye hai
 It is also important that the Bill proposes a one-time lump sum opportunity for resident Indians holding undisclosed income or assets abroad to declare their assets, pay taxes and pay fines
 iske badale unhen in sampatti par sampatti kar nahin dena hoga or unhen iskar kanoon, sampatti kar kanoon, seemaa shulk kanoon, videshi mudra vinimay prabandhan kanoon or company kanoon ke tahat karrwai or mukadmaa nahin jhelana hoga
 But if this scheme is effective, not only theoretical but procedural questions are also being raised
 shailendra kumaar kehete hai, ''vidheyak kii bhashaa main yah spasht nahin he ki aghoshit sampatti kii ghoshnaa karne vaale ko aay ke strot yaa sampatti ke bare main poocha jayega yaa nahin
 And if someone confesses income from illegal sources, then there is no guarantee that this case will not be referred to ED for taking action under PMLA law
 ''ve chetate hai, ''koi yaad kar saktaa he ki vidiies (svaichhik aay udghoshnaa yojana) yojana ke khatm hone ke baad kuch rajyon ke bikrikar adhikariyon ne kuch vyapaariyon or fermon ko ghoshit atirikt bikri se praapt rakam par kar bhugtan kaa notice bhej diya
 But Malik of the Finance Ministry insists that this is not a general amnesty scheme as it does not offer exemption from penalty
 ve kehete hai, ''nae kanoon ke sakht praavdhaanon ke lagu hone ke pehle yah logon ko apana daaman paak-saaf karne or kar adaa karne kaa mahaj ek avasar he
 However, schemes that have disclosed tax evasion so far have been issued 12 times - from the Income Proclamation in 1991 to VDIS in 1997 - and have not been very successful
 isaki mul vajah yah aam dharna he ki sarkaar kar vanchanaa par ankush lagane ke maamle main gambhirtha nahin dikhaa paati
 In India, big influential and high-reaching people are usually left without any penalty or penalty
 iske vipareet, reporton ke mutabik america apane ofsor valentary discloger program ke jariye 5 arab dollar kaa kar rajasav juta chukaa he
 Similarly, besides bringing back 56 billion euros in Italy, 1
 4 arab euro kaa kar rajasav jutaya ja chukaa he
 Not surprisingly, apart from these two countries, many countries in Europe took action against many influential people to show the seriousness of their intentions
 vidheyak videshi khaaton main jamaa kaale dhan ko aparaadh kii shrenee main to rakhata he par sarkaar abhi bhi desh main paidaa hone vaale kaale dhan par maun he
 The Finance Ministry does not have any concrete information about black money at home and abroad
 usne teen sarkari thimk tanks ko bharat or videsh main jamaa kaale dhan kii kul rakam kaa akalan karne or uske paidaa hone kii vajahen pataa lagane kaa jimmaa diya tha lekin inaki koi report aaj tak jari nahin hui he
 However, given the sensitivity of the public to corruption and black money, no political party can be expected to oppose the bill completely, yet the government may find it difficult to respond to some of its controversial provisions
 sanyog se, yah vitt vidheyak he isliye is par rajyasabha main bahes jaruri nahin hogi
 It can be passed in a limited debate in the lower house of Lok Sabha
 kuch aalochakon ke mutabik sarkaar kii yah kisi tarah ke virodh se bachane kii bhi jugat he

 Sen had claimed that the Saradha group had paid Rs 1 crore as legal advice fee to lawyer Nalini

 Navjot Singh Sidhu, a minister and former cricketer in the Punjab government, is now on target of his government's ministers due to rhetoric
 somvaar ko punjab cabinet kii ek baithak bulaai gai
 In which Sidhu got a big relief
 darasal baithak se pehle kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki kuch mantri alag se baithak kar is mudde ko cabinet main uthaane kaa faisla kar sakate hai
 Sidhu can be asked to either withdraw the statement or apologize or even ask for his resignation from the post of minister
 haalanki, is mudde par koi bada faisla nahin ho sakaa
 The issue of Sidhu's "who's Captain" statement did not come up in today's meeting of the Punjab cabinet
 alaakaman ke sakht nirdesh ke baad captain amarinder singh or punjab sarkaar ke mantriyon ne siddhu ke maamle par chuppi sadhi
 Only routine issues were discussed in cabinet meetings
 captain amarinder ke nivas par cabinet baithak main aruna choudhary, sadhu singh, sukhwinder randhaava, opi soni, manpreet badal samet kai mantri pahunche
 Navjot Singh Sidhu will be in Nagaur, Rajasthan for election campaign today
 isi kaaran vah baithak main shaamil nahin hue
 However, today he will hold a rally and press conference
 bataa den ki siddhu ne haal hi main bayaan diya ki unke captain mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh nahin balki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi hai
 After which many ministers of the Punjab government have demanded the resignation of Sidhu
 'sabake saamne nahin dhote maili chadar'baithak se pehle navjot singh siddhu ne mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ke saath chal rahe vivaad par pehali baar safai di
 Sidhu told the media in Jhalawar, Rajasthan that Captain Amarinder Singh is like his father, he respects him
 jo bhi vivaad he vah unase milakar sulajhaa lenge
 Meanwhile, Sidhu also tweeted, "bad days are going, Rahul Gandhi is going to come"

 About 10 ministers of the state government are upset with Sidhu's rhetoric
 iske alaava mantri ravanit singh bittu kaa kahana he ki punjab kii sabhi galiyon main poster lage hai ki 'punjab kaa captain hamaara captain', yani punjab waalon ke liye captlemarinder singhhi unke mukhiya hai
 Tera captain-my Captain It is worth mentioning that Sidhu had asked during a press conference on the issue of Pakistan, that Captain Amarinder Singh is the Captain of the Army, his Captain is Rahul Gandhi
 or captain (amarinder singh) ke captain bhi rahul gandhi hi hai
 Significantly, Sidhu went to Pakistan for the foundation stone of Kartarpur Sahib Corridor, he said that he had gone to Pakistan at the behest of Rahul Gandhi
 aazaadee ke baad congress ko is baat kaa gaurav praapt tha ki sabhi dharmon or sampradaayon ke log uske saath the

 By the 90s, the Dalits were completely separated from the Congress
 na uske paas kaddavar dalit netaa the or na hi dalit vot bank
 Mayawati emerged as the eldest leader of the Dalits and defeated her vote bank
 iskaa hi nateeja rahaa ki unhen upi main jabardast kamyaabi mili
 Strongly opposing the forward castes, she made her place among the Dalits and became a contender for the post of Chief Minister
 bijepi ke saath milakar vah uttar pradesh ke mukhya mantri ke pad par kabiz bhi huin
 But over time she understood one thing that she could not remain in power by opposing forward castes
 so unhone soshal engeering kaa sahaara liya or brahmanon ko apane saath le liya
 This was a revolutionary step and people saw it with great surprise

 paswan kii party bhale hi pichley chunaav main kuch khaas nahin kar pai he lekin yah sach he ki uske samarthakon kii taadaad kaaphi he
 It may not be able to turn into a vote bank on its own, but it can leave an impact on many seats in association with a party like BJP
 paswan ke baad ab dalit netaa or purv beurocrat udit raaj bhi bijepi main chale aae hai
 He certainly does not have much power in the politics of votes, but he suits the party as a symbol
 bijepi ne is baar soshal engeering kii ek koshish kii he
 It wants to make a dent in the vote bank of the Congress and also send a message to the supporters of parties like Bahujan Samaj Party

 unhone kaha tha ki vah manmohan singh se milane ko utsuk hai
 Prior to the meeting between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Xi, India had clearly indicated that it would take positive initiatives on China's new leadership's desire to improve relations without being confined to problems like border dispute

 2013 ke daravaaje khulte hi ek chintajanak shikaayat ai he ki bhartiya purushon kaa veery ab pehle jaisaa nahin rah gaya he
 a large-scale global study in France in December 2012 found that the average sperm count dropped by 32 percent
 is khabar se chikitsa jagat main hadakamp much gaya he
 Discussions have begun in India and many scientific evidences confirm that the culture of denial and silence has hidden the story of the fall of Indian men's semen
 pichley saal agast main kendriya swasthya mantri gulam nabi aaazaad ne rajyasabha main kaha tha, “purushon main infertility bad rahi he
 “doctors already know that this is the biggest confidential fact of the country regarding health
 isiilie jab koi dampati kisi doctor ke paas jaataa he to ve sabase pehle purushon kii jaanch karaate hai
 The first study in this regard was conducted at Kasturba Hospital in Manipal in 2008 on 7,700 men whose semen was found to be of poor quality
 iske baad se kai adhyayan ho chuke hai
 a research from Delhi's Indian Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) shows that sperm count per milliliter of semen has fallen from six crore to two crore over the course of three decades

 The Delhi unit of the Congress has announced a Parliament siege on July 18 to protest against GST
 pradesh congress adhyaksh ajay maakan ne kaha ki haal hi main surat main lakhon logon ne jiesti ke virodh main pradarshan kiya isamen na sirf vyapaaree varg tha balki karmchaaree or aam janata bhi thi
 Maken said that Rahul Gandhi has also opposed GST because the central government has made 6 slabs of GST and has set a maximum limit of 40%
 jabaki congress 14% kii adhiktam seemaa ke saath jiesti lagaana chaahati thi
 Maken said that the merchant class of Delhi felt cheated due to GST
 maakan ne kaha ki dilli ke kai vyapaaree sanghathan congress party ko apni pareshaani bataa rahe hai
 Targeting the Modi government, the Congress state president said that the Modi government has imposed a similar GST on scooters and Mercedes cars
 maakan ne kaha ki modi sarkaar 28 pratishat jiesti marcides car par lagaati he or utana hi scooter par lagaati he aakhir yah kaise jaij he
 Due to these anti-people policies of the BJP, now on 18 July, the party will surround the Parliament with millions of workers and businessmen of the state
 congress party shuruyaat se jiesti kii adhiktam seemaa tay karne kii maang karti ai he

 The increase in policy rates by the Reserve Bank of India prepared the ground for costly loans
 lekin duusari ore jamaa par byaaj daren badhane kaa rasta bhi khol diya
 In the last one week, the two major banks (SBI and HDFC) have increased interest rates on fixed-term fixed deposits (fds)
 niveshkon ke bich epady main nivesh, jokhim rahit vikalpon main sabase zyada lokapriy he
 This is also because tax benefit is also provided for fds of more than 5 years
 haalanki is nivesh se bachane kii salaah dete hai
 Why avoid getting FD? - Investing in FD is risk free
 lekin isapar milane vaala ritern kai baar mahangaai kii tulana main kam hota he
 If the policy rate (repo rate) in the country is at a lower level then banks reduce the interest rates on deposits
 aise main epady par milane vaala ritern mahangaai kii tulana main kam ho jaataa he
 Any investment that is less than inflation indirectly depreciates capital
 -epady main nivesh par milane kaa ritern aay kii tarah joda jaataa he, jo karyogy hota he
 If an investor falls under the taxable income, then the interest on FD increases his income and tax liability
 finanntial export jitendra solanki kehete hai pehle mahangaai se ladane vaala ritern na mil paanaa or phir ritern main milane vaali raashi kaa karyogy hona ye do kaaran epady main nivesh ko behatar nahin banaate
 Common investors do not know this
 ve jokhim rahit nivesh, kabhi bhi epady todwane kii suvidha jaise fitures ke chalate epady kaa rukh karte hai
 What is the option if not FD? Solanki believes that it is better to invest in mutual funds than FD
 lambii avadhi ke liye jahaan ek ore equity mutual funds kaa vikalp he, vahiin duusari ore choti se madhyam avadhi ke liye date, liquid yaa ultra short turm mutual funds kaa rukh kiya ja saktaa he
 This will directly benefit the investor
 pehla, nivesh par milane vaala ritern epady kii tulana main zyada hoga
 On the other hand, you will get the benefit of long term capital gains tax on returns
 solanki kehete hai ki mutual funds kii alag-alag category main kai tarah ke vikalp maujuud hai
 Where an investor can invest for a week, 6 months or even a few years
 date mutual fund main jokhim bhi simit hota he
 In such a situation, it would be better for the investors not to turn to FD for their investment and explore the options available in mutual funds

 National President of the National People's Party (NPP), Konrad Sangma, took oath as the Chief Minister of Meghalaya today
 meghalaya vidhansabha chunaav main 21 siten jeetne ke baavjood congress sarkaar nahin bana saki
 a coalition of NPP, United Democratic Party (UDP), People's Democratic Front (PDF), BJP and HSPDP (hill State People's Democratic Party) led to the formation of a non-congress government in Meghalaya, commanded by Konrad Sangma
 padhai ke baad pita ke saath kariyar kii shuruyaat27 janvari 1978 ko janmeconrad sangama nefinance main emb kiya he
 After completing his studies, Konrad Sangma started his career as publicity manager for father PA Sangma in the late 1990s
 us samay pie sangama rashtravaadi congress party (rakanpa) main the
 PA Sangma formed the National People's Party in July 2012 after breaking up with NCP
 meghalaya ke sabase kam umr ke vitt mantri2008 ke vidhansabha chunaav main rakanpa ke tikat par conrad apane bhai james sangama ke saath pehali baar vidhayak chune gaye
 During that time he held many important positions in the state government and became the youngest Finance Minister of Meghalaya
 pehali baar vitt mantri banane ke 10 din main hi unhone bajet pesh kiya tha 
 Conrad Sangma was the Leader of the Opposition from 2009-2013 in the Legislative Assembly of his father
 pita pie sangama ke nidhan ke baad khaali hui tura seat par hue upachunaav main may 2016 main ve saansad chune gaye
 He is a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Energy since September 2016
 conrad sangama kaa parivarrajaneta, kaarobaari or samajasevi conrad sangama ke pita pie sangama meghalaya ke mukhyamantri or loksabhaa adhyaksh rahe, jabaki unki bahan agaatha sangama pichhali congressnith sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (upie) sarkaar-do main mantri rahi thim
 Agatha Sangma was elected MP in the 15th Lok Sabha
 conrad ke bhai james sangama bhi vidhansabha sadsy hai
 After the death of PA Sangma, Konrad became the head of the National People's Party
 aam aadmi party (aap) main pichley 24 ghante se chalaa aa rahaa drama kumaar vishwaas ke maan jane se khatm samajha ja rahaa he
 Kejriwal & Co
 managed to convince Kumar
 yahi nahin unamem vishwaas dikhaate hue unhen nai jimmedaari bhi di
 At the same time, the party has also accepted the terms of Kumar Vishwas
 amanatullah ko suspend karne kaa faisla kiya gaya
 In such a situation, the question is, what did Kumar Vishwas get in this entire controversy? What things went with your way to convince Kumar Vishwas
 yani kumaar kaa party se 'vishwaas' bhi nahin diga or kejariwal ne agle mishan ke liye kumaar ke kandhon par jimmedaariyaan bhi daal deen
 Trying to please and increase responsibility? Obviously, the action against Amanatullah, who described Kikumar Vishwas as an agent of BJP, has been decided only to fulfill the conditions of Kumar Vishwas
 kumaar ke maan jane ke baad sisodiya ne kaha ki bhale hi vishwaas lagaataar kah rahe hon ki unhen pad or party kaa koi laalach nahin he, lekin party ne unki jimmedaariyon ko badhaate hue rajasthan kaa prabharee bana diya he
 To give the responsibility of Rajasthan to Kumar Vishwas means that assembly elections are going to be held in Rajasthan next year and the Aam Aadmi Party has played the stakes
 kumaar vishwaas lagaataar party netritv par sawaal khadaa kar rahe the
 Kejriwal has shown confidence in him by giving him the responsibility of Rajasthan
 kumaar vishwaas ke paas zyada samay nahin he or unako rajasthan main kuch kar guzarana hoga
 Otherwise voices will be raised against Kumar again? Kumar Vishwas has a special relationship with Rajasthan
 After being made in-charge on the other side, it is clear that in the Kirajasthan election, Kumar Vishwas will be the main face in the election
 kumaar vishwaas kaa rajasthan se khaas rishta he or unki patni manju sharma bhi rajasthan ke chittorgarh se he
 Kumar Vishwas himself has been singing his poems in Rajasthan and has his own fan following
 vishwaas ke paas patni kaa saathkhaas baat yah he ki kejariwal ke ghar meeting ke baad baahar nikalate vaktkumar vishwaasake saath unki patni bhi maujuud thim
 That means in the coming days, his role in the party will increase and along with Kumar Vishwas, his wife will also take charge in Rajasthan
 kaha ja saktaa he ki pati-patni ne milakar gotiyaan tareeke se set kii hai
 Not only this, while fighting against Rahul Gandhi and Smriti Irani from Amethi in the 2014 general election, Kumar Vishwas was also with his wife

 ) GDP despite the facilities like credit card, debit card and online payment in the country (1
 4 trillian dollar yaa 90 lakh karod rupee) kaa do-tihaai hissaa puri tarah cash par nirbhar he
 Cash is used extensively in the country for purchasing goods, for taking services and in salary allocation
 ab 8 november ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ke elaan ke baad se arthvyavastha ke is do-tihaai hisse main afra-tafari kaa alam he
 The currency of 500 and 1000 rupees has been deprecated and new notes of 500 and thousand are slowly reaching the economy
 is bich 100 rupee or 50 rupee kii karency note apane aap main camodity ban chuki he
 Necessary purchases are being made from these currencies, so people are reluctant to spend it openly
 jaaniye desh main kahaan-kahaan kaarobaar cash main or sirf cash main hota he-transport or maal dhulihive par trakon ke jariye maal dhulaai or public transport kaa adhikansh kaarobaar cash par nirbhar he
 Millions of trucks running in the country are running on cash economy only and only
 transport companiyaan apni trakon ko desh ke ek kone se duusare kone par bhejne ke liye cash par nirbhar hai kyonki yatra ke vakt trakon main eendhan, driver or anya staff kaa kharch, toll or chungi tex ke saath-saath yatra ke dauraan trakon main kharabi aane par marammat kaa kaam sirf or sirf cash par chalata he
 At the same time, public transport such as trains, buses, metros and urban movement such as autos, rickshaws are completely dependent on cash system
 food or grosri marketsbharat kaa food or grosri market duniya kaa chatha sabase bada market he
 About 70 percent of the retail business is in the region
 food or grosri market main karondo chote dukandaar (ritailor) or upabhokta sirf or sirf cash par kharidari karte hai
 The cash in the Galla mandis sitting on top of it starts when the farmer takes his grain to sell it in the mandis
 kisaanon ko apane galle ke liye sirf or sirf cash kii ummid rahati he kyonki banking ke modern saadhan jaise check, draft, acount transfar par bharosa nahin rahata he
 Apart from this, selling in these mandis takes place at various levels and usually there is a presence of three to four middlemen between the farmer and the consumer, which benefits from the cash system itself
 construction saamaan- cement, saria, baaluu, eent ityadiconstruction sector main aam aadmi ko makaan nirmaan ke liye cement, saria, baaluu, eent jaisi ritel kharidari ke liye puri tarah cash par nirbhar rahanaa padataa he
 Because of this, cash dominates the entire real estate
 8 november se shuru hue karency sankat kii sidhaa asar cement or saria kii cell par dikhaai de rahaa he
 While cement companies are assuming that their retail sales have fallen by more than 50% due to lack of availability of new currency, the situation of the second important product of this sector is worse
 jahaan cement kii thok bikri main check athwa draft se ho jaati he lekin ritel bikri puri tarah cash par nirbhar rahane ke kaaran thok kharidari ke advance order sthagit kiye ja rahe hai
 At the same time, the market is completely dependent on cash
 lebar or asangathit udyog main sailavishwa bank kii report ke mutabik bharat main prati maah lagbhag 10 lakh log workforce main shaamil hote hai
 Most of them are involved in large-scale factories and real estate sector as labor
 notebandi ke pehle tak in sector main lebar kii dihadi puri tarah se cash par nirbhar rahati he
 According to the Ministry of Labor, labor in the country gets an average daily wage of 250 to 300 rupees
 is dihadi main lebar kaa prati din khaane par kharch lagbhag 20 rupee aata he kyonki aamtaur par 5-6 lebar paisa milakar khaadya saamagree kii kharidari karte hai
 But since demonetization, work on the largest company and the smallest construction site in the country has almost stopped as everyone is facing currency problem
 nateeja yah he ki zyaadaatar lebar kaam nahin karne par majaboor he kyonki udhaar par kaam karne ke alaava unke paas koi vikalp nahin hai
 Due to this, most of the laborers after demonetisation are spending their money on the hope that the cash problem should be eliminated at the earliest
 jewelery or sona, chandimaujuuda samay desh main shaadiyon kaa he
 This was also the time for the fast jewelery business
 lekin notebandi ke faisle se desh main sona, chaandi or jewelery kii kharidari par bhi sankat main pad gai he
 As soon as the decision came, some people tried to hide their unaccounted cash, but even this trick could not be successful for more than a few hours
 darasal, shaadi-vivaah ke liye jewelery kii kharidari ho yaa phir aedcounted paise ko surakshit karne ke liye sone-chaandi kii kharidari ho, yah puri tarah se hard cash par nirbhar tha
 Jewelers used to deposit large amounts of cash in their business current account due to cash from buyers in this sector
 iske alaava chote-bade jewalers cash ke sahare hi bullian market main sone or chaandi kii kharidari bhi karte the
 But with the decision of demonetisation, where customers face the challenge of buying jewelery for undertaking marriages, jewelers are also now forced to cancel the advance order given to bullion market to avoid cash payment

 It is the responsibility of the family to impose values in children, who should learn to live with others

 There was no action against the negligent agencies after the death of a man who fell in a road pit in Basantkunj, Delhi last Saturday, but the game of accusation between the Kejriwal government and the Delhi Police has started
 PWD ko sadak ke gadde thik na karne dene kaa aarope lagaate hue mantristyendra jainane kaha ki police kaa to dhandha he logon se paise maangane kaa
 PWD Minister Satyendra Jain was asked a series of questions when the Delhi Police denied that the road pits were repaired
 police ne aapke daawey ko khaarij kiya ki chote-chote mentanence ke liye parmishan kii jarurat nahin hoti he?jawaab:kabhi bhi parmishan kii jarurat nahin hoti he
 PWD can fix the roads of Delhi itself
 lekin trephic police or dilli police ne unki gaadiyaan jabt kii or kaam nahin karne diya
 Wrote letters to the police on 8 July, 14 July and 21 July
 2
 What was the reason for stopping the PWD train? Answer: You may want money
 unka to dhandha he logon se paise maangane kaa
 Can ask anyone
 3
 Who is responsible for the death of a man between the charges and counter-allegations of Delhi Police and the Government? Answer: Why did not take action if you wrote the letter
 hamane likhaa ki aapke log tang kar rahe hai kaam nahin karne de rahe hai
 Magistrate inquiry has been conducted
 jisaki galati hogi karrwai karenge
 4
 akhir kab thik honge sadak ke gadde?jawaab:dilli main 30 hajaar sadakon main 1260 kimi sadak PWD ke paas he
 If there are pits on the road, then you can call 1077 and will fix it immediately
 dedline kii jarurat nahin
 Be it PWD, DDA or MCD, the official agency will be responsible for fixing the pit in the area in which the road comes
 kaise world class city banegi dilli?ek taraf kejariwal sarkaar desh kii rajdhani ko world class city banane kaa daawa karti he to duusari taraf dilli kii sadakon kaa haal kisi daraavne sapane se kam nahin hai
 The Ring Road passes through large areas of the city, but in spite of this the agencies are ignoring the pits
 sarkaar par uthte sawaalon par jab AAP netaa dilip pandeya se sawaal poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki 'us shaks kii maut gadde main funsane se nahin hui balki trek ke upar chadh jane se hui
 PWD has 1250 km of road maintained by them
 or PWD ke log is baat kaa dhyaan rakhenge kii gadde na hon
 'these pits have become the biggest problem for bike drivers at the moment
 sabase zyada vyast rahane vaale kaale khan bas adde or railway stesan ke najadik se guzar rahi ring road par gadde to hai hi, inamen barish kaa pani bhi bharaa hua he
 Bike drivers say that now walking on the road is scared
 sarkaar ko gaddhon kii marammat ke kaam par gambhirtha se dhyaan dena chahie

 On March 21, in Jharkhand's Dhanbad, former deputy mayor and coal business tycoon Neeraj Singh was shot dead
 niraj singh mafia king se rajaneta bane suraj dev singh kaa bhatija tha
 It is said that the story of the film Gangs of Wasseypur was woven around Suraj Dev Singh
 isamen tigmanshu dhulia ne ramdhir singh ke naam se unka kirdaar nibhaayaa tha
 Suraj Dev Singh's influence was that PM used to reach to his home to eat Chuda and Curd
 dhanbad kii kahani thodi tedi he
 If you look from outside, it seems to be a city of straightforward people
 magar andar jhaakiega to maaloom chalegaa ki ek se badhkar ek turram khan yahaan gujarey
 How proved to be the topper is a different matter
 kam se kam jite ji to yahaan saare ke saare apane aapako phanne khan hi samajhate rahe
 Yes, but there is one name that even when he lived and became king of Dhanbad even after his death, he was Suraj Dev Singh
 jinaki javaani main tuuti bolti thi
 People bowed their heads
 do dashakon tak kaayam rakhaa sikaaye koyalanchal hai
 Which we call Dhanbad
 yahaan jameen ke neeche khadaanen muddat se sulag rahi hai
 The mafia gang-war which is on the ground is on fire
 uski aanch paanch dashak guzar jane ke baad bhi buji nahin he
 Beginning in the 50s
 jab bi
 P
 sinha is ilaake main trade union ke sabase bade netaa ke rup main ubhar rahe the
 He held his coin in this area for nearly two decades with an army of Lathas and Bahubalis from Bihar and UP
 dhanbad kaa sabase bada mafia kingsaal 1979 main unhen usee surajdev singh ne maaraa jise unhone paala tha
 Surajdev Singh, a resident of Ballia after BP Sinha, became the biggest mafia king of Dhanbad
 sarayadhela main uskaa singh mension lambey vakt tak dhanbad koyalanchal main koyale ke kaarobaar se lekar rangadari ke dhandhe or trade union ke self stield secreterriott ke rup main mashhoor rahaa
 The decree that came out of Suraj Dev Singh's mouth
 wo us vakt koyalanchal kaa kanoon ban jaataa tha
 PM Dhanbad officials used to eat food with Don, did not dare to challenge Vosuraj Dev Singh's law
 dhanbad ke alag alag thanon main suraj dev singh ke khilaaf hatya se lekar rangadari ke do darjan se zyada maamle darj the
 Despite this, his political clout was so high that Chandrashekhar, who was the prime minister, used to reach his home to eat chuda and curd
 lambey vakt tak emele rahe surajdev singh kii dil kaa daura padane se 1991 main maut ho gai
 But the gang kept on going

 Although the processor is not the flagship, but we did not realize this in everyday use

 Vivo X21 does not lag and it is easy to switch from one app to another

 Yes, if you are a power user, a heavy user, then you will definitely understand the difference
 adgar disple fingerprint scanrachunki yah technology nai he isliye hamane iskaa bhi rivyuu kiya he

 disple ke neeche ke porshan main aapako ek ikon dikhegaa jise press karke phone open kar sakate hai
 It takes some time to register fingerprint

 heavi yuj yani browjing, video dekhnaa, gaming or soshal media kaa zyada istemaal
 Should you buy this smartphone? There are some other smartphones in this segment that give it a competition, one of them is oneplus 6 which has been launched recently in India
 oneplus 6 ke spacification or camera zyada behatar hai or is vajah se wo isapar baari padataa he
 But if you want a fingerprint scanner inside the technology display a step ahead, then apart from this in the market, you do not have another option
 agar aap vivo ke fain hai to aap ise miss nahin kar sakate hai
 Apart from the under display fingerprint scanner, this smartphone is also excellent overall

 apni hi team kii mahila patrkaar ke saath yon shoshan ke aarope main ghire tahalaka ke tarun tejpal kaa ab kanoon se bachanaa lagbhag naammumkin ho gaya he
 On November 7, 2013, Tehelka's Think Fest was going on at the Five Star Hotel in Goa on Saturday
 tahalaka ke editor in chif or jane-maane patrkaar tarun tejpal samet duniya ke kai mashhoor chehre is fest kaa hissaa the
 And among these famous faces, there was also a face of that anonymous girl, who had come to perform her duty in this fest, but before she returned from here after paying her duty, she herself met the evil intentions of her own boss Tarun Tejpal
 Became a victim
 ladki kii maane to tejpal ne uske saath ek nahin, balki do-do baar jyaadati kii or munh kholane par bure anjaam kii dhamkee bhi di
 After the complaint made by Tehelka Managing Editor Shoma Chaudhary, the girl told the Goa police the whole story with her, the listeners just kept listening
 kyonki ye tejpal kaa wo cheharaa tha, jo ab tak kisi ne nahin dekha tha
 According to the girl's statement to the Goa police, that night when she was returning from leaving a guest to her room, she found her boss Tarun Tejpal in front of an elevator in Block 7 of the same hotel
 tejpal ne guest ko dobaaraa jagaane kii baat kah achaanak use waapas usee lift ke andar khinch liya, lekin abhi ye ladki kuch samaj paati ki isi bich tejpal ne lift ke batan kuch aise dabaane shuru kiye, jisase naa to lift kahin ruke or naa hi darwaja khule
 And then Tejpal did what he did in this closed lift, when his secrets were open, often due to his sting operation and revelations, there was a panic in the life of Tarun Tejpal who created panic in political circles
 tejpal kii beti peedita kii acchhee dostagova police ko die gaye bayaan main peedit ladki ne bataaya ki tarun tejpal ne tab lift main hi usase chhedchhad shuru kar di
 This act of Tejpal was a big shock for him, even more shock than that, because till now he had considered Tejpal as his father's friend and Tejpal's daughter himself is his good friend
 peedit ladki ke mutabik jab tejpal uske saath band lift main jyaadati kar rahe the, wo in rishton kii duhai de rahi thi
 Moreover, he reminded Tejpal of his friendship with his daughter, but there was a ghost on Tejpal's head
 haalat ye ho gai ki jab thodi der baad lift rukii, to wo kisi tarah apane kapade sambhalakar lift se nikal bhaagi, lekin ye is ladki kii pareshaaniyon kaa ant nahin tha
 The second time too, flirting in the elevator itself, that night, this girl told her friend on her phone, besides her boyfriend, about this incident, but the next day, Tejpal repeated the same act with her in an elevator of the same hotel
 And now it was all out of tolerance for him
 or isi ke baad is ladki ne apni best frand or tejpal kii beti ko uske pita kii puri karatuut bayaan kar di
 But know, what Tejpal's daughter replied then, if the girl believes, she said that she had earlier seen her father doing this to another woman when she was only 13 years old
 yon shoshan ko lekar ab tak sirf baaten ho rahi thim
 Accusations were being made, answers were being sought for the charges
 lekin ab jo kuch hua wo yakeenan tarun tejpal par baari padane vaala he
 On the one hand, the Delhi High Court has reserved the decision on Tejpal's anticipatory bail till 29 November, on the other hand, the victim girl has uncovered a copy of Tejpal's misdeeds before the magistrate in Goa
 tejpal kii giraftaar kaa countdown shuruugova police ke saamne aupchaarik shikaayat darj karaane ke baad peedit ladki ne goa jaakar magistrate ke saamne bhi bayaan darj kara diya
 The countdown to the arrest of Tarun Tejpal on charges of sexual exploitation and rape has begun
 peedit ladki kii shikaayat par goa police tarun tejpal ko pehle hi panaji ke donna pola thane main hajiri lagane kaa saman jari kar chuki he
 After recording the statement before the magistrate, now the warrant of arrest can be issued at any time
 magistrate ko die 22 pej ke bayaan main ladki ne puure tafsil se bataaya he
 What happened, the girl gave the details of what happened to her at Think Fest on the night of 7 and 8 November, in her statement, the girl has clarified that whatever happened happened against her will
 tejpal kii taraf se sahmati kii baat uthaane se uski manahani ho rahi he
 He has also given details of conversations with Tehelka's colleagues present at Think Fest
 iske alaava tejpal ko bheje esemas or email kii copy bhi jamaa kii he
 In the statement, the girl also said that managing editor Shoma Chaudhary did not help her
 balki tejpal ke rishtedaaron kii taraf se us par police main bayaan nahin dene kaa dabaav bhi banaaya gaya
 According to the Goa police, the complaint of the girl and the statement made to the magistrate match the e-mail sent to Tehelka management after the incident, according to the Goa police
 tejpal is ghatana ko lekar bhale hi apane bayaan badalte rahe, lekin peedit ladki apane bayaan par adig he
 The Goa Police has completed the initial investigation on its part and to clamp down on Tejpal
 lekin ise lekar tejpal or unke karibiyon kaa kahana he ki unhen fansaaya ja rahaa he or ise goa kii bijepi sarkaar uksaa rahi he
 But Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar dismissed those allegations outright
 haalanki mukhyamantri giraftaar ke sawaal par jawaab taal gaye
 Saying that this is a police matter and it is better to leave it to them
 karrwai shuru ho chuki he
 The summons for Tejpal to appear before the Goa Police has also been issued
 police kaa kahana he, ki tejpal agar saman kii andekhi karte hai, to unke khilaaf gaiyr jamaanti warrant jari kiya jayega
 Relief not received by Delhi High Court: Zepal is getting caught in the net of law slowly and slowly that breathing in the open air in the future may prove to be his dream
 dilli hai court se philhal raahat nahin mili or duusari taraf goa police ne unhen poochtacha ke liye saman bhejkar usee goa main haazir hone ko kaha he jis goa se is scandle kii shuruuaat hui thi
 The crime branch of Goa Police is investigating this entire case
 tejpal ke khilaaf yon shoshan kaa maamla aane ke baad goa police ne hi balaatkaar kaa maamla darj kiya tha
 After this, the Goa police also came to his home in Delhi to inquire Tejpal, but there was no inquiry
 is bich goa sarkaar ke rukh se saaf he ki wo maamle ko aise hi nahin chhodane vaali he
 Money was also earned by Tarun Tejpal Netrun Tejpal gave journalism a new identity
 sting oparation ke zarie bade-bade khulaase kiye
 But as he rose to the top ranks of journalism, he also spread his business rapidly
