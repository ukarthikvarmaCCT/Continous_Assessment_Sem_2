 On the one hand, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal is playing the sting of his rule in Bihar
 duusari ore dilli main unki hi sarkaar ke vibhaag citijan charter par amal nahin kar rahe hai
 Exclusive papers in the hands of Delhi Aaj Tak show that about half of Delhi's 41 departments have not provided information related to Citizen Charter to the government
 vah bhi tab, jab khud upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne sabhi vibhaagon ko khud likhakar jaankaree maangi he
 The matter is related to the implementation of Citizen Charter
 kejariwal sarkaar bani, tojanata kii samasyaon ko dur karne kii batahui
 How to listen to the people, how to connect them with the government, on every issue, the government formulated its strategy
 dilli waalon kaa kaam ek tay samay main ho, ise lekar citijan charter banane par charchaa hui

 darasal, dilli ajtak ke paas jo jaankaree he, vah citijan charter kii ab tak kii kahani bayaan karti he
 About two months ago, Manish Sisodia called the head of all the departments and asked for information related to the work of the people in his departments
 yah bhi poocha gaya ki aakhirkaar kitne dinon ke bheetar wo logon ko apane vibhaagon se judi sevaayen muhaiyaa kara paaenge
 What assistance was needed by the government to the departments, it was also asked
 lekin kai vibhaagon ne yaa to jaankaree hi nahin di, yaa phir di, to aadhi-adhuri
 In total, 22 of the 41 departments have not yet given complete information
 ab sab kuch kachhue kii raftaar se chal rahaa he, to virdohi to nishaanaa saadhenge hi
 Now the challenge before the government is not how to spell out the work, but also how the government is able to connect its departments with the common Delhiites

 " For the first time in the last 22 years in Gujarat, the BJP is hesitant to make any promise to the people of the state due to the tough competition
 ise lekar vaicharik aadhaar par party do hisson main bant gai he
 While one section is in favor of issuing an election manifesto or vision document, the other faction wants to go to the polls without any promise
 is maamle main sheersh netritv koi faisla nahin le paaya he
 The first phase of election campaign ends on December 7 and so far the party has not been able to issue the manifesto or vision document
 kya he vajah?party pehleghoshnaa-patr jari karne ke paksh main thi, lekin sheersh netritv kaa maananaa tha ki isse congress ko rajya sarkaar par hamalaa karne kaa mauka mil jayega
 The Congress can say that even after 22 years, the BJP is still promising what it will do if it comes to power
 sutron kaa kahana he ki is tark ko maan liya gaya
 Then it was decided that the vision document should be issued in place of the declaration
 sahmati to bani, lekin phir usamen bhi adnga lag gaya
 The argument has been made that since the vision document does not have a time frame, the bjp's vision document will look lighter with the release of the Congress manifesto
 sutron kaa kahana he ki ab mukhyamantri or unke samarthak chaah rahe hai ki aaj hi vijan document jari ho jaae, jabaki up-mukhyamantri ke samarthak chaah rahe hai ki chunaav main vijan document jari karne kii jagah mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa ghoshit kar diya jaae, taaki sandesh saaf jaae ki jo cheharaa project hua he wo kis soch ke saath kaam karne vaala he, jameen par kitni pakad he or kaam karne main kitna sakasham he
 This is the difference The declaration in the vision document and declaration letter is for 5 years
 lok pratinidhitiv adhinium, dhara 123 ke tahat raajnneetik party logon se vaada kar sakati he, lekin vaada sambandhit rajya ke vidhaan ke mutabik ho, rajya ke aarthik sansaadhan kii seemaa main taarkik ho
 If it is not, then it can come under the limits of corrupt conduct
 misaal ke taur par, janata se sone kii chen vagairah dene kaa vaada
 The vision document is not bound by the time limit
 isamen sirf bhavishya main rajya ko kaisaa bananaa he iskaa ek khaakaa rakhaa jaataa he
 It can be said that after 10 years where to take the state financially
 isamen rajya ke maujuuda sansaadhan se lenaa-dena hona anivaary nahin he
 In a way, the Vision Document is not binding under Section 123 of the Public Representation Act

 uttar pradesh kii raajnneeti khaskar samaajawaadee party ke andar jo uthapathak chal rahi he, bhale hi uskaa prabhaav bihar kii raajnneeti par tatkaal kuch na pade, lekin ise lekar rashtriya janata dal (argedy) ke adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav tanaav main hai
 Actually, Lalu Yadav's concern is not that his attempts to intervene and the claims have been shelved, but the way Akhilesh has taken power and party and is drawing a long line in politics
 
 
 yah lalu ke liye chintaa kii vajah he
 It is not hidden from anyone that Lalu and Mulayam Singh Yadav, despite being of the same caste in politics, were strongly opposed to each other at their political peak
 donon ke bich raajnneetik katutaa kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa hai ki lalu ne mulaayam singh ke pradhanmantri banane kii ummid par apane prayaas se pani pher diya tha
 Though Lalu had apologized in later days, believing it to be his fault, it fell short years later from the marriage of Lalu's youngest daughter Lakshmi, who was married to Tej Pratap Singh, grandson of Mulayam Singh Yadav's elder brother
 
 tej pratap samaajawaadee party ke mainpuri se saansad bhi hai
 It is different that despite this relationship, when Lalu and Nitish announced the merger of Mulayam Singh Yadav with the Samajwadi Party and Ram Gopal Yadav alone managed to stop this merger, it was assumed that Lalu also had a silent consent
 lekin lalu kii pareshaani he ki filhal unhen agle kuch dinon main ye nirnay lenaa hoga kii do dhadon main banty samaajawaadee party ke kis dhade ke saath wo rahete hai
 Whether it is Akhilesh's Samajwadi Party or Shivpal's
 
 
 lalu ke liye kisi ke samarthan main khadey hona utana aasaan nahin hoga
 Though he will try, where his son-in-law steps in, it will be better for him to stay with him
 filhal lakhanu se khabaron ke anusaar tej pratap, akhilesh yadav ke saath hai, isliye mulaayam singh ke peeche na khadey rahanaa ab unki majaburi he
 This is where Lalu Yadav's real difficulty begins
 darasal, lalu yadav ko maaloom he ki bhale akhilesh yadav ne apane pita ko maardarshak mandal kaa rasta dikhaa diya ho, lekin ab tak ke akhilesh ke man or mizaaj se ek cheez saafe he ki wo sarkaar or party chalaane ke liye kisi apradhi, bahubali se kisi tarah kaa sambandh nahin rakhana chaahate
 
 bhale hi wo kisi jati yaa dharm se aata ho
 On this basis, Lalu knows that there are not a dozen people in his party, on whom the leaders like Akhilesh are not related to being ignored
 lalu jaanate hai ki nitish kumaar ke liye modi virodh ke naam par unke saath raajnneetik sambandh rakhane kii majaburi ho, lekin akhilesh ke liye aisi koi baadhyataa nahin he or tab lalu ko der-saver ye nirnay lenaa hoga ki wo akhilesh ke saath bhavishya kii raajnneeti karte hai yaa apni party ke bahubaliyon ke saamne natmastak rahete hai
 However, whenever a leader of his party, whether it is Shahabuddin or Raj Bhallav Yadav
 
 Nitish government took action against them, then Lalu thought it better to save the government by keeping silent
 tippaniyan But the real problem of Lalu Yadav is that now every day, Akhilesh will be the center of discussion among his supporters of Bihar and here the discussion will be focused on the 'performance' of his two sons Tej Pratap and Tejashwi Yadav
 akhilesh aaj puure desh main charchaa ke centre main hai, tab unka kaam mukhya aadhaar rahaa hai or lalu yadav khud bhi jaanate hai ki sab jaanate hai ki apane beton ke vibhaag kaa remote unke paas rahane ke baavjood akhilesh ko chhodie, lekin nitish kumaar ke purv ke bijepi ke mantriyon se bhi tulana karne ke laayak unka kaarykaal nahin rahaa he
 At present, Lalu Yadav has kept eight departments in his two sons and his son Tejapratap Yadav does not go for months in many department offices
 apane vibhaag ke kaarykram main bhi tejpratap kaa nadaarad rahanaa charchaa kaa vishay hota hai
 Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav is interested in building one of his department paths, but never seen as much social media activity in the work of other departments
 lalu yadav khud adhikansh vibhaag ke kaamkaaj main khulkar dakhlandaji bhi karte hai
 Which today does not match the politics and style of functioning of Akhilesh brand
 haalanki lalu se zyada unke beton ko ab raajnneeti ke brands lalu or akhilesh main se ek ko chunanaa hoga
 They can go to some extent in power by following Brand Lalu, but by adopting Brand Akhilesh, they can fulfill political ambitions of their life especially Tejashwi Yadav
 
 Otherwise, the brand Nitish will continue in Bihar as long as they want to remain in power
 ye baat kisi se chhipi nahin ki lalu or mulaayam singh yadav raajnneeti main ek hi jati ke hone ke baavjood apane raajnneetik shikhar par ek-duusare ke kattar virdohi rahe
 The political acrimony between the two can be gauged from the fact that Lalu lost his efforts on Mulayam Singh's hope of becoming Prime Minister
 haalanki lalu ne ise baad ke dinon main apni galati maanate hue maafi bhi maangi thi, lekin ye khatas varshon baad lalu kii sabase choti beti lakshmi kii shaadi se kam hui, jisaki shaadi mulaayam singh yadav ke bade bhai ke pote tej pratap singh ke saath hui
 Tej Pratap is also an MP from Samajwadi Party's Mainpuri
 ye baat alag he ki is sambandh ke baavjood jab lalu or nitish ne mulaayam singh yadav ke samaajawaadee party main vilay kii ghoshnaa kii or ramgopal yadav ne akele is vilay ko rokane main kamyaabi pai thi tab ye mana gaya ki lalu kii bhi maun sahmati thi
 But Lalu has a problem that for the next few days he will have to decide which faction of the Samajwadi Party, which is divided into two factions, lives with
 chaahe wo akhilesh kii samaajawaadee party ho yaa shivpal kii
 
 
 It will not be easy for Lalu to stand in support of anyone
 haalanki unki koshish hogi, jahaan unke damaad ke kadam hon, uske saath rahanaa hi unke liye behatar hoga
 Currently, according to reports from Lucknow, Tej Pratap is with Akhilesh Yadav, so it is his compulsion not to stand behind Mulayam Singh
 yaheen se lalu yadav kii asal mushkil shuru hoti he
 Actually, Lalu Yadav knows that even though Akhilesh Yadav has shown his father the way to the guide board, one thing is clear from the mind and mood of Akhilesh so far that he is from any criminal, Bahubali to run the government and the party
 Do not want to have any kind of relationship
 
 Even if he comes from any caste or religion
 is aadhaar par lalu ko maaloom hai ki unke party main ek nahin darjan bhar log aise hai, jis par akhilesh jaise netaa sambandhi hone ke aadhaar par nazarandaaj nahin karne vaale
 Lalu knows that Nitish Kumar has a compulsion to have political relations with him in the name of opposing Modi, but there is no such compulsion for Akhilesh and then Lalu will have to take a decision in the future to future politics with Akhilesh Do or bow down before your party's musclemen
 haalanki jab bhi unki party ke kisi netaa bhale hi wo shahabuddin ho yaa rajbhallav yadav
 
 unke khilaaf nitish sarkaar ne karrwai kii, tab lalu ne maun rahakar sarkaar bachaana zyada behatar samajha
 The comments lekin lalu yadav kii asal dikkat is baat ko lekar he ki ab har din bihar ke unke samarthakon main akhilesh charchaa kaa centre rahenge or yahaan unke donon bete tejpratap or tejasvi yadav ke 'parformens' par charchaa kendrit hogi
 Akhilesh is at the center of discussion all over the country today, then his work has been the mainstay and Lalu Yadav himself knows that everyone knows that leave Akhilesh despite his sons department being remote, but before Nitish Kumar His tenure has not been worth comparing even to BJP ministers
 filhal lalu yadav ne apane donon beto ke hisse main aath vibhaag rakhe hai or kai vibhaag ke daftar main bhi unke bete tejpratap yadav maheenon nahin jate
 Tej Pratap's absence in the program of his department is also a matter of discussion
 up mukhyamantri tejasvi yadav apane ek vibhaag path nirmaan main ruchi to lete hai, lekin anya vibhaagon ke kaamkaaj main jitna soshal media main unki sakriyata rahati hai, utani kabhi nahin dekhi gai
 Lalu Yadav himself also openly interferes with the functioning of most departments
 jo aaj kii taarikh main akhilesh brands kii raajnneeti or kaamkaaj kii style se kahin bhi mail nahin khaataa
 However, more than Lalu, his sons will now have to choose one of the political brands Lalu and Akhilesh
 brands lalu kaa anusaran kar wo satta main ek had tak ja sakate hai, lekin brands akhilesh ko apanaakar wo khaskar tejasvi yadav apane jivan kii raajnneetik mahatvakanksha ko puraa kar sakate hai
 
 anyathaa bihar main brands nitish tab tak chalata rahegaa jab tak wo satta main bane rahanaa chaahate hai
 But Lalu has a problem that for the next few days he will have to decide which faction of the Samajwadi Party, which is divided into two factions, lives with
 chaahe wo akhilesh kii samaajawaadee party ho yaa shivpal kii

 ' The Associated Journals Limited (AJL), the publisher of the National Herald newspaper, has challenged the Central Government's order to end the lease and vacate the Herald House at ITO
 court mangalvaar ko is yachika par sunwaayee karegaa
 The Urban Development Ministry, in its order, has said to end the lease of the Herald House and vacate it by 15 November
 isse pehle is imaarat ko khaali karne ke liye ageel ko notice jari kiya gaya tha
 But the department received no response from the National Herald in this matter after which the department took the last action in October and ordered it to be vacated
 shahari vikaas mantralay ke bhoomi va vikaas karyaalay (alendio) kaa kahana he ageel ko yah jameen akhbaar prakashit karne ke liye di gai thi
 But no activity related to the publication of the newspaper is taking place in this building
 alendio kaa kahana tha ki is maamle main niyam or sharton kaa paalan naa hone or jameen kaa galat istemaal hone ke kaaran lij ko radd kar waapas lene kaa faisla liya gaya he
 While AJL has stated in its petition in the Delhi High Court that at present, Hindi, English and Urdu newspapers are being removed from this building
 angreji main neshnal herald, hindi main navajivan or urdu main kaumi aawaaj ke naam se akhbaar prakashit kiye ja rahaa hai
 In such a situation, the decision to vacate the building is completely arbitrary and politically motivated
 itio kii puraani imaarat ko khaali karaane ke peeche sarkaar kii manshaa vipaksh kii aawaaj ko dabaane kii he
 The petition said that despite the removal of Hindi, English and Urdu newspapers, if the land is being withdrawn and the lease is canceled then it is clear that this is being done with the intention of closing these newspapers
 jo sidhe taur par samvidhan ke anuchhed 19 (1)(a)kaa ulanghan he
 The petition said that the government is plotting to shut down the National Herald, inheriting the legacy of the country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru

 This was where Kishan Bapat Baburao alias Anna Hazare had his first fast for the Jan Lokpal
 6 april, 2011 ko
 This was Anna's first knock in Delhi - so loud that he was seen shaking up to the corridors of power
 dekhte hi dekhte puraa desh anna ke saath ho liya
 People from place to place - wearing the hat of 'main Hain Anna' came down the streets
 tab unke saath ek majboot toli hua karti thi team anna
 Now it is not round - nor is it noisy now
 dilachasp ye he ki phir bhi anna kaa josh kaayam he
 Anna has again announced the movement from her village Ralegan Siddhi
 ek intervyuu main anna kehete hai, "log ab samaj gaye hai ki unhen dhokhaa diya gaya he
 They will teach them a lesson like they taught Congress
 "kya anna kar paaenge?sabase bada sawaal ye he ki kya anna phir se ramlila andolan jaisaa kuch kar paaenge
 Team Anna, then, had the ability to read people's moods and habits
 team anna ne logon kii aadat ko apni ranneeti kaa hissaa banaaya
 For support, he asked people to give 'miss Call' to a particular number instead of sending SMS
 isamen logon ne bad-chadh kar hissaa liya
 The movement took place at a time when people were bored of corruption [even if there is a slight difference, the situation is still the same]
 andolan ke jariye anna ne logon main ek ummid jagaa di thi
 Success usually depends on the country, time and situation
 raajnneeti main jepi andolan or lagbhag usee daur main ai amitabh kii filmon kii kamyaabi ke peeche bhi yahi factor maane jate hai
 Anna's erstwhile allies kept the movement on the right track and ended the scope of disorientation
 shaayad haa
 
 
 Anna can
 Her image is absolutely impeccable
 log anna kii baton par baakiyon ke mukaable zyada yakeen karte hai
 He believes in following the path of non-violence as stated by Mahatma Gandhi
 ramlila andolan ke dauraan manch se vah baar baar apil karte rahe ki log shant rahen varanaa police unhen tikne nahin degi
 People listened to Anna
 anna or log - donon maidan main date rahe
 As the time passed, his team disintegrated, but Anna kept his word
 ramlila andolan ke baad bhi vah hameshaa bhrashtachar ke mudde par focus rahe
 These things make Anna powerful
 shaayad nahin
 
 
 There is no talk of Anna's control, Anna's entire team is shattered
 anna andolan ke architect kahe jane vaale arvind kejariwal ab aam aadmi party ke netaa hai or dilli main dobaaraa mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar hai
 Kejriwal was seen on one side of Anna in that movement and Kiran Bedi on the other side
 bedi ab bijepi kii ore se dilli main mukhyamantri pad kii ummidavaar hai
 Yoga guru Ramdev, who supported the Anna movement, also joined the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections, while former Army Chief General VK Singh is now a minister in the central government
 kejariwal ke party bana lene ke baad anna ne kiran bedi or general wike singh ke saath andolan khadaa karne kii koshish kii thi, lekin nateeja sifer hi rahaa
 In the later days also one or two such attempts took place but all of them proved to be unsuccessful
 anna kar bhi kya sakate hai – guzarate vakt ke saath umr bhi haaavee ho rahi he
 The person is in power provided 
 
 13 dinon tak chale anshan ke kaaran anna ke vajan main us vakt saadhe saat kilo kii kami aa gai thi
 He was first treated in a hospital in Gurgaon and then underwent treatment at a naturopathy center
 vah anushaasit jivan jite hai
 Take small meals and work out regularly
 tab kii team anna ke kejariwal, kiran bedi, shanti bhushan, prashanth bhushan, manish sisodiya or kumaar vishwaas ne alag raste akhriyaar kar liye, phir bhi kuch log aise hai jo anna andolan se jude rahe lekin matbhedon ke chalate alag ho gayi
 Justices Santosh Hegde, Swami Agnivesh and Rajendra Singh are names who stayed with the movement for some time but later got busy with their social work
 anna phir se andolan khadaa kar sakate hai – haa iske liye unhen ek team manager kii jarurat he jaise pichhali baar unke saath kejariwal the
 Anna needs such an aide, so be fearless
 mulk ke liye kuch kar guzarane kaa madda ho
 Be impeccable ahimsa ke raste par chalane main yakeen rakhata ho
 Ekal chalo re 
 
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii sarkaar ke khilaaf anna ke andolan ko lekar aam aadmi party ne samarthan jataayaa he
 AAP leader Manish Sisodia has said that he will support Anna in his movement like an activist
 ramlila andolan ke dauraan netaaon ko manch se dur rakhane kii baat kii jaati rahi
 Anna's old companions have now become leaders
 isliye ab anna ko unka saport bhi manjuur nahin he
 Anna insists, "ekla chalo re, i have no need of Kiran Bedi and Arvind Kejriwal
 mere saath janata he
 "why should i be sad when i don't have a team with me?" Dreamed
 
 
 or marane nahin diyaapana anshan khatm karte vakt anna ne kaha tha, “yah aadhi jeet he
 We still have to win the whole battle
 ” apane nae andolan ko anna shaayad aazaadee kaa teesraa andolan naam den
 The most dangerous is the death of dreams
 pash kii is line se prerit najar aate anna ne jo sapana dekha tha – use ab tak nahin marane diya he
 In such a situation, Anna's supporters probably do not have to be hopeless

 She has also appeared in many films with megastars like Salman Khan
 isi saal disambar main netflix par unka sho misses serial killer bhi release hone ja rahaa he
 Although he is not very comfortable with acting even after spending a decade in the industry
 yahi kaaran he ki unhone acting claces join karne kaa faisla kiya thajacleen ne apni shuruuaati filmon ke bare main baat karte hue kaha ki 'darasal maine bollywood ke liye kisi bhi tarah kii training nahin lee thi, naa hi meraa koi filmi becoground tha

 mujhe is duniya ke bare main koi andaaza hi nahin tha to main har din ke hisaab se chunautiyon ko sweekaar kar rahi thi lekin pichley saal mujhe ehsaas hua ki main ye taumr nahin kar sakati hum

 -input bhashaa Manoj Tiwari was crowned as BJP President in Delhi to make inroads among the Purvanchali voters, but now that the elections of MCD are at the head, the side effects of making Bhojpuri Superstar the President are in front of the party
 aisa nahin he ki manoj tiwari filmi duniya main mast hai, balki party ke bheetar hi manoj tiwari kii demand he ki unke liye philhal dilli dur si ho gai he
 The biggest side effect is when the MCD election process has started
 dlimitesan ke baad vaardon kaa aarakshan bhi tay ho chukaa he, lekin dilli bijepi adhyaksh kii gaiyr maujuudagi jhel rahi he
 Because Manoj Tiwari is the bjp's star campaigner in UP as well as the president of Delhi BJP and currently his popularity is high in the areas where elections are to be held
 lihaaj party ne unhen chunaav prachaar main laga diya he
 This is the reason that the party has fixed a busy schedule for them, but its effect is visible in Delhi
 jo manoj tiwari jhuggiyon main pravaas kar bijepi ke liye vot bank majboot karne main jute the, emsidi chunaav kii tasviir saaf hote hi dilli se gaayab se ho gaye hai
 As soon as the UP publicity gets a free hand, they do have a darshan in Delhi, but it is difficult for people hoping for a ticket that Tiwari is unable to meet face to face
 dilli bijepi ke daftar main manoj tiwari kii team ye dikhaane kii koshish jarur kar rahi he ki kaam chal rahaa he
 By running a series of meetings, it is also being told that the party's processes are also going on, but the reality is that Tiwari's non-functioning is increasing the anxiety of the workers
 aisi hi ek baithak main hissaa lene ain saroj tomars kahati he ki unhen ummid he ki party ke netaa unki ore se ilaake main kiye ja rahe kaamon ko dekhegi or unhen party tikat ke kaabil samajhegi
 But he also regrets that Manoj Tiwari could not be met
 ek or mahila kaaryakarta kusum ke mutabik philhal manoj tiwari upi chunaav main vyast hai, isliye unase mulaakaat nahin ho paayi
 But in the meeting of Mahila Morcha, she definitely said her point
 dilli bijepi ke upaadhyaksh rajeev babbar kii daleel he ki manoj tiwari party ke star prachaarak hai, lekin dilli main unhendhyaksh banaae jane ke baad khub kaam kar diya haior unki team use aage badha rahi he
 Things were revealed during the slum migration, work is being done on it
 tiwari ke nirdesh ke mutabik hi party chal rahi he
 According to the party's state vice president Jayaprakash, Manoj Tiwari is engaged in lotus feeding in UP, after winning UP, Tiwari Delhi will also win the party

 Courtesy: newsflicks upi bijepi kii bigadi hui sehat ko sudhaarney ke liye uttar pradesh ke prabharee amit shah fasebuk kii sharan main hai
 Amit Shah is currently on a tour of Uttar Pradesh and is meeting the in-charge and office-bearers of all the eight zones of the UP BJP
 lekin iske saath hi amit shah bhaajapa kaa haal jaanane ke liye fasebuk kaa bhi sahaara le rahe he
 Amit Shah is posting the details of his tours on his Facebook account and is appealing to meet ordinary workers and leaders
 saath hi unase bijepi kaa andruni haal bhi jaan rahe hai
 Amit Shah has recently opened his Facebook account
 is account par amit shah ke 11,500 se bhi zyada foloar hai
 Most of the BJP workers and Modi are assistants in this
 in saadhaaran bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon or sarmathkon ko party ke upi prabharee amit shah se milane ke liye ab na kisi bade netaa kii pairvi kii zarurat he or na hi line main khadey hokar dhakke khaane kii zarurat he
 Facebook and Twitter have made it very easy to reach out to Amit Shah
 uttar pradesh ke bijepi pravaktaa vijay bahadur ne kaha, 'sabhi netaa maujuud hai
 As in-charge of Uttar Pradesh, the venerable Amit Shah is on the Facebook site
 unke jo uttar pradesh pravaas ke kaarykram hote hai wo khud post karte hai or kai baar aapane dekha ki twitor or fasebuk kii citon par wo khud likhte hai ki mai elahabaad pahunch rahaa hum, main kanpur pahunch rahaa hum, main lakhanu pahunch rahaa hum or apeksha he ki aap milenge
 Overall, the purpose of writing is that there is no barrier to meet
 'yuva morcha ke pradesh sadsyta prabharee anand shahi kehete hai, 'is website ke jariye bees lakh javaanon ko jodne kaa uddeshy he
 We are connecting people between 18 and 35 years through this
 kisi ko bhi unase sambandhit jaankaree chahie to mil jaaegi
 These days Amit Shah is holding meetings in eight areas in Uttar Pradesh where rallies of the party's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi are going on
 iske liye wo baithak ke pehle fasebuk or twitor donon par jagah or samay donon bataate huye apane program ko post kar dete hai
 The motive behind this is that the workers can openly share their point with them
 unke pej par milane vaale caments se unhen upi bijepi kaa asli haal bhi pataa chalane laga he
 According to activists, Amit Shah is also hearing the problems of UP BJP on the lines of Gujarat
 bhajayumo ke kaaryakarta amarendra kumaar kehete hai, 'is website ke dwaara ham isse jud sakate hai
 If there are any kind of problems, the answer comes immediately
 party main bahut se log hote hai, agar kisi ko samasya hoti he to ham apane senior se share karte hai or wo amit shah ke paas jaati he
 'vijay Bahadur Pathak says,' There are many people who are BJP supporters, but not workers
 ve log chaahate hai ki narendra modi ji desh ke pradhanmantri bane or bijepi kii sarkaar banaaen
 They write suggestions and we respect these suggestions
 kai baar hamen suzav suut karata he or kai baar lagata he ki hamen suzav ko lagu karnaa chahie
 It has now become easier for Amit Shah to know those things which were not known due to the presence of senior party leaders in the earlier meetings
 unke pej par aa rahe caments se bhi unhen upi bhaajapa kaa asli haal maaloom pad rahaa he or shaayad isliye apane sabhi baithkon main amit shah netaaon se apil kar rahe hai ki aapasi matbhed bhulaakar ve party kii safalataa ke liye jute jaaen
 If this time fails in UP, then UP BJP will be like Tamil Nadu
 uttar pradesh ke mirzapur jile main ek baar phir rishton kaa khun ho gaya
 a son who became groggy over a land dispute, strangled his elderly father to death

 Lal Chandra, who lives in a dispute with his 75-year-old Pitaraghunath over land rights
 aae din isi baat ko lekar unamem kahasuni hoti rahati thi
 Lal Chandra quarreled with his father again on the issue last night
 isi dauraan laal chandra ne apanepita kii hasia se galaa katkar hatyakar di
 He tried to escape after the incident
 lekin police ne hatyaropee bete ko giraftaar kar liya
 The police have also registered a case of murder and recovered the strings used in the murder
 input- bhashaa From the Kumbh Mela, Sarkaryavah Bhaiyyaji Joshi of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has taunted the Modi government for the construction of Ram temple, while Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat has surrounded the government about the martyrdom of the army soldiers at present
 unhone kaha he ki jab kisi ke saath yuddh nahin ho rahaa he, to phir border par sainik shahid kaise ho rahe hai
 Raising this question, the RSS chief also explained the reason for this and said that this is happening because we are not doing our work properly
 mohan bhagwat ne yah bayaan guuruuvaar ko nagpur main prahaar samaaj jagriti sanstha ke rajat jayanti kaarykram ke avasar par diya he
 Talking about the martyrdom of the soldiers, Mohan Bhagwat also mentioned the time of independence
 unhone kaha ki jab desh ko angrejon se aazaadee nahin mili thi to us dauraan vatan kii swatantraaa ke liye jaan qurbaan kaa daur tha
 Or if there is a war or after independence, the soldiers fight their lives on the border there and sacrifice their lives for the safety of the country
 isse aage mohan bhagwat ne maujuuda halaat par tippanee karte hue javaanon kii shahadat par sawalia nishaan laga diya
 There is no reason for martyrdom other than war, the Rss chief said in his statement that there is martyrdom of soldiers during the war, but if there is no war happening in our country at the moment and still the soldiers of the army are getting martyred then its This means that we are not doing our work properly
 aage unhone kaha, 'agar koi yuddh nahin he to koi kaaran nahin he ki koi sainik seemaa par apni jaan ganvaae
 But this is happening
 'bhagwat ne kaha- roki jaae sainikon kii shahadatamohan bhagwat ne seemaa par javaanon kii shahadat par sirf chintaa hi jaahir nahin kii, balki unhone yah aahvaan bhi kiya ki ise rokane or desh ko mahaan banane ke liye kadam uthaae jane chahien
 This statement of Mohan Bhagwat is considered very important
 khaastaur par jammu kashmir ke sandarbh main, jahaan modi sarkaar aatank ke safaye ko pramukhataa se uthaati rahi he or apni peeth thapathpaati rahi he, aise main seemaa par javaanon kii shahadat kyon ho rahi he kii bahes ko janm dekar aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ne sarkaar ke daavon par vipaksh ko chot karne kaa mauka jarur de diya he
 According to the data received from the Ministry of Home Affairs through RTI, during the first three years of the Modi government, from May 2014 to May 2017, only 812 terrorist incidents took place in Jammu and Kashmir
 in ghatnaon main 62 naagarik maare gaye, jabaki 183 javaanon kii shahadat hui
 Opposition parties have been targeting Modi government keeping similar figures in front
 haalanki, sarkaar apane bachaav main ghati se aatankiyon ke bade paimaane par safaaye kaa hawala detii rahi he
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has once again demanded the removal of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution
 RSS netaa indresh kumaar ne kaha ki anuchhed 370 ko hataane se bharat kii kirti or yash badhegaa
 The future of the country will change and it will move towards a new condition and direction
 jaipur main yuva diwas ke maukey par unhone yuvaaon se kaha ki aapako swami vivekanand ke maarg par chalakar aage badhane kii aavashyaktaa he
 He said that the Kashmir problem was due to some political families, who incited the people there against Hindustan for their benefit
 unhone kaha ki pakistan pryojit aatankwaad se bharat jujh rahaa he
 Since the year 1972, 66 thousand people have lost their lives due to terrorism in India
 itnaa sab kuch hone ke baavjood ab bhi bharat-pakistan seemaa par golibari or aatanki ghuspaith jari he
 However, he also said that the policies of the Modi government have reduced terrorist incidents
 ise bhi padhieh anuchhed 370 ke virodh main thi congress, sardaar patel ne joda ise samvidhan main
 
 
 8 Proof RSS leader said that many separatist leaders are eating the air of jail and the work of connecting the stray youths to the mainstream is being done
 isse pehle piem modi ne ek jansabha main kaha tha ki anuchhed 370 par bahes honi chahie
 It may be known that BJP also included removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir in its election agenda
 aakhir kya he anuchhed-3701
 Article 370 of the Constitution gives Jammu and Kashmir the status of a special autonomous state through temporary arrangements
 2
 The 370 was prepared in 1947 by Sheikh Abdullah, who was appointed Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Maharaja Hari Singh
 3
 Sheikh Abdullah argued about Article 370 that it should not be provisionally administered in the Constitution
 unhone rajya ke liye majboot swytta kii maang kii thi, jise centre ne thukraa diya tha
 4
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 370ke praavdhaanon ke anusaar sansad ko jammu-kashmir ke bare main raksha, videsh maamle or sanchaar ke vishay main kanoon banane kaa adhikaar he
 But to implement the law related to other subject, the Center needs the approval of the state
 5
 Due to this special status, Article 356 of the Constitution does not apply to Jammu and Kashmir
 raashtrapati ke paas rajya ke samvidhan ko barkhaast karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 6
 bharat ke duusare rajyon ke log jammu-kashmir main jameen nahin kharid sakate hai
 Citizens here have dual citizenship
 ek naagarikta jammu-kashmir kii or duusari bharat kii hoti he
 7
 yahaan duusare rajya ke naagarik sarkari naukari nahin kar sakate
 8
 bhartiya samvidhan ke anuchhed 360 jisamen desh main vittiya apatkaal lagane kaa praavdhaan he, vah bhi jammu-kashmir par lagu nahin hota
 9
 anuchhed 370 kii vajah se hi jammu-kashmir kaa apana alag jhanda or pratik chinh bhi he
 10
 1965 tak jammu or kashmir main rajyapal kii jagah sadar-e-riyasat or mukhyamantri kii jagah pradhanmantri hua karata tha

 ye teen netaa koi naa koi kaaran bataakar is dinar party main nahin aa rahe
 Key constituent DMK party sources said Karunanidhi would not attend the dinner being organized by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for the leaders and mps of the UPA constituents and TR Baalu, the leader of the DMK parliamentary party, would represent the party
 haalanki sutron ne 88 varshiya varisht netaa ke samaaroh main shaamil naa ho paane kii vajah nahin bataayi
 Relief for the UPA is that Samajwadi Party mps will join this party

 Dhoni scored 29 runs in 37 balls in India's score of 126 for 7 wickets
 is pich par gend sidhe balle par nahin aa rahi thi
 Successive wickets had fallen and he was with Yuzvendra Chahal at the crease
 maxwell ne dhoni kaa bachaav karte hue kaha, ‘yah (dhimi ran gati) shaayad thik hi thi, wicket jis tarah se bartaav kar rahaa tha, is par kisi bhi ballebaaj ke liye ran bananaa bahut mushkil tha or wo bhi aise khilaadi chahal ke saath jo hit karne main maahir nahin ho

 It was a pitch in which the ball was low and Dhoni could only hit a six
 maxwell ne kaha, ‘dhoni nishchit rup se ek vishwa stareey finishr hai or unhen balle ke bich se gend hit karne main mushkil ho rahi thi
 So i think it was right that he kept rotating the strike
 unhone antim over main ek chakka jamaaya or mujhe lagata he ki isse saaf dikhataa he ki vahaan kitni mushkil ho rahi thi

 However, his place in the 15-man squad for the World Cup is not guaranteed
 maxwell ne match ke baad press kafrence main kaha, ‘mujhe bilkul nahin pataa he ki main vishwa cap team main shaamil rahoonga yaa nahin or main kis number par ballebaaji karuunga isliye mujhe lagata he ki yah maukey par nirbhar karata he

 panditji ne buddhiraja se kuch halke-phulke andaaj main kaha ki ab yah ghar na badalanaa
 Budhiraja is known for building his base from one city to another every few years

 To give auspicious blessings to the new house, they have to start singing with a single hymn in every house

 Elections are in the head in UP but there is no reconciliation in the Yadav-father son of the ruling Samajwadi Party
 isse pehle donon hi gut chunaav ayog main jaakar samaajawaadee party or uske chunaav chinh cycle par apni-apni daavedaari pesh kar chuke hai
 But in the meantime, the old loyal leaders of the party have once again requested Azam Khan to get them reconciled
 iske pehle bhi ajam khan ne hi mulaayam or akhilesh ke bich sulah karwaai thi, haalanki wo ek din bhi nahin chal pai
 Azam Khan has once again agreed to reconcile the son-in-law of the Samajwadi Party's political riot
 lekin unki shart he ki ye aakhri koshish hogi
 Azam has said that he is most disappointed but not hopeless
 aise main aazam ek formale ke saath mulaayam singh yadav se milane dilli aae the
 Azam Khan first tried to get Mulayam and Akhilesh to talk on the phone, then both of them agreed to meet face to face together
 mulaayam singh dilli se lakhanu pahunche or akhilesh ne lakhanu main apane pita ke ghar jaakar unase akele main baat bhi kii he

 mulaayam ke amar or akhilesh ke ramgopal ko party se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya jaae
 In fact, on many occasions, even if the father-son duo is ready to agree, according to experts, the powers with which the father and son are surrounded separately, they come to an end in some way
 mulaayam kii kamajori amar or shivpal hai, to vahiin akhilesh kaa haath ramgopal ke saath he
 After the father-son meeting in Lucknow, the Akhilesh faction met at Ram Gopal Yadav's house in Delhi and Ram Gopal Yadav also dismissed all possibilities of reconciliation
 haalanki party ke saansad javed ali kaa kahana he ki party main koi jhagada nahin he or netaji hi unke adarsh hai
 How the reconciliation will happen in this situation may not even know the Yadav family itself
 kyonki, ab tak wo subah milte hai, shaam ko ladate hai,agle din subah phir mil jate hai or raat hote-hote ladaai saamne aa jaati he
 The family feud continues unabated
 ajam apni aakhri koshish main jute hai
 Formulas have also been brought, but the decision has to be taken by Akhilesh and Mulayam or else this breakdown of father and son will be recorded and remembered forever in the history of Indian politics

 ' The climax scene of the film Dangal was witnessed in Aurangabad district of Maharashtra
 aurangabad main ek raceling pratiyogita ke dauraan 17 saal kii ek ladki ne 34 saal kii mahila pahalwaan ko chaaron khaane chit kar diya
 The 17-year-old Amreen Syeda, who hails from Harsool in the Phulambari tehsil of Aurangabad, was taken aback when she accepted the challenge of a woman wrestler, twice her age and almost twice her weight
 darasal dilli kii 34 varshiya mahakay mahila pahalwaan shivani ne harsul kii mahila pahalawaanon ke saath-saath purush pahalawaanon ko bhi chunauti di thi
 No female wrestler has accepted this challenge of Shivani, even male wrestlers
 tabhi amarine saiyada aage nikaleen or unhone shivani kii chunauti sweekaar kar lee
 Everyone was amazed at what this girl was going to do
 lekin jaisaa hamane film dangal main dekha, hausala buland ho to kuch bhi naammumkin nahin he
 When wrestling started, the only thing in everyone's mind was whether this little girl will be able to stand in front of the first lady of Delhi or not
 shuruyaat main choti si amarine par shivani baari najar aa rahi thim
 Viewers also started laughing at Amrin Saida's ignorance
 amarine kaa man bhi dawandol hone laga tha, uskaa aatmavishvaas dagamagane laga tha ki kahin usne chalange sweekaar kar galati to nahin kii
 But somewhere Amrin had confidence in her training and gained confidence
 or kushti dekh rahe logon ko vah chakit karne vaala pal dekhne ko mila
 Suddenly, a small 49 kg Amrin hit Bangdi Daw and blinked at the 72 kg strong female wrestler Shivani Matt in Delhi
 aurangabad jile ke phulambari tehsil main ek chote se gaanv ganori kii rahane vaali saiyada amarine ke begumpura main kushti kii practice karti hai or aurangabad ke aas-paas hone vaali kushti kii sabhi pratiyogitaaon main hissaa leti hai
 Saida has so far attracted many prominent wrestlers in Aurangabad's wrestling competitions
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki pratibhavan saiyada ko kushti main aage badhaava miltaa he or vah rashtriya evam antarrashtriya str par bharat kaa pratinidhatv kar paati hai yaa unka yah karnama yun hi choti si kahani banakar rah jaaegi

 9 members of the Congress party decided to vote against the appropriation bill in the assembly
 18 march 2016 ko 35 sadasyon ne viniyog vidheyak ke viruddh tathaa 32 sadasyon ne iske paksh main matdaan kiya
 The written proceedings of the Legislative Assembly confirm that the members had demanded a vote but despite this the appropriation bill is claimed to have been passed without voting
 is baat ke paryaapt sakshya hai ki viniyog vidheyak vastav main mat vibhaajan main gir gaya tha
 The Appropriation Bill granting expenditure from April 1, 2016 was not approved
 agar viniyog vidheyak paarit nahin hua tha to 18 march 2016 ke baad sarkaar kaa satta main bane rahanaa asanvaidhanik he
 If the finance minister had no credibility with the law, the law minister would have been writing a blog on such issues, whose name is Sadanand Gowda
 kair vitt mantri ne viniyog vidheyak ke bare main likhaa he kya unase sawaal kii gunzaaish paidaa hoti he
 As the Finance Minister says, the Appropriation vote had fallen into division

 It is alleged that the speaker announced the passing of the Appropriation Bill by voice vote

 Is the speaker bound that he will accept the demand for division of the vote and if the speaker refuses, then what are the provisions for action against him? spikar ne dhwani mat se jo vidheyak paas kiya he kya use chunauti di ja sakati he
 If the Governor rejects, does the Governor here have the right to reverse the Speaker's decision
 mere paas saare ke jawaab nahin hai magar vitt mantri ke blog se kai sawaalon ko lekar jigyaasa ho rahi he
 The Finance Minister has written about the Appropriation Bill in his blog, 'it is to be noted that till date, neither the Chief Minister nor the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly has sent a certified copy of the Appropriation Law to the Governor
 isliye swaabhaavik he ki viniyog vidheyak ko rajyapal kii manzuri nahin mili he
 ' ab sawaal ye uthta he ki kya 18 march ko kathith rup se dhwani mat se viniyog vidheyak paas karaane ke baad spikar yaa mukhyamantri ne use rajyapal ke paas bheja tha
 Can the speaker or the chief minister present the fact that it was sent
 vitt mantri to likhte hai ki nahin bheja tha or aaj tak nahin bheja he
 But why the Governor did not ask for or ask for information about the Appropriation Bill, which the Government fell and President's rule was imposed
 kya sara faisla viniyog vidheyak kii pramanik prati dekhe bina hi le liya gaya yaa faisla yun hua ki vidheyak kii pramanit prati bheji hi nahin gai
 The daily Uttarakhand, Hindustan and Amar Ujala had published news regarding this question

 The Finance Minister says that till date a certified copy of the Bill has not been sent

 When the reporters asked why they were disqualified after the imposition of President's rule, the speaker said that they did not have written notice of imposition of President's rule

 The speaker also said that if the members feel that the government is in minority then why did they not demand to prove majority in the House
 dhyaan rakhiyegaa ki jab vitt vidheyak sadan main gir jaataa he to wo bhi ek kism kaa avishvaas prastaav hi mana jaataa he

 The speaker can accept the request if he feels the matter is important and there is a general opinion in its favor in the House
 pej 118 main kaha gaya he ki sadan ke andar spikar kaa adhikaar sarvocch he or ye adhikaar uski purna nishpakshta ke aadhaar par use hasil hota he

 ' ab sawaal ye uthta he ki kya 18 march ko kathith rup se dhwani mat se viniyog vidheyak paas karaane ke baad spikar yaa mukhyamantri ne use rajyapal ke paas bheja tha
 Can the speaker or the chief minister present the fact that it was sent
 vitt mantri to likhte hai ki nahin bheja tha or aaj tak nahin bheja he
 But why the Governor did not ask for or ask for information about the Appropriation Bill, which the Government fell and President's rule was imposed
 kya sara faisla viniyog vidheyak kii pramanik prati dekhe bina hi le liya gaya yaa faisla yun hua ki vidheyak kii pramanit prati bheji hi nahin gai
 The daily Uttarakhand, Hindustan and Amar Ujala had published news regarding this question
 alag-alag khabaron ke mutabik 18 march ko paas kiya gaya viniyog vidheyak spikar ne turant rajyapal ko bhej diya tha
 The Finance Minister says that till date a certified copy of the Bill has not been sent
 hamaare sahyogi dinesh mansera ke sutron ke anusaar aaj yani 28 march ko rajbhavan ko isaki pramanit prati bheji gai he
 Since this information is formula based, we cannot claim it, but if it is correct information then how the authentic copy of the Appropriation Bill was sent yet
 kisi ne maanga yaa spikar ko iskaa khyaal aayaa
 Today, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat said that the appropriation bill sent to the governor should not be tampered with and should be passed by the Center in the same form as it is an appropriation bill passed by a majority government
 vitt mantri apane blog main viniyog vidheyak ke bare main aage likhte hai ki viniyog vidheyak par kathith charchaa or uske paarit hone sambandhi sabhi tathy saaf taur par iske paarit na hone kii ore ishaara karte hai
 Indicates or asserts that the appropriation bill has not passed
 phir vitt mantri agle paragraph main kyon likhte hai ki 'viniyog vidheyak ke bare main gambhir ashanka he
 If the Appropriation Bill was not passed, the government should have resigned on 18 March but it did not do so
 ' Whether or not the vote was split or not, how did this bill fall in the division? vidheyak kii pramanik prati rajyapal ko bheji gai yaa nahin bheji gai
 The speaker did or did not ratify the bill
 yaa to viniyog vidheyak paas hua yaa nahin hua lekin yahaan ek teesri sthiti ubhar rahi he ki gambhir ashanka he ki paas hua
 Jaitley has written that there are documents as proof of everything
 aage likhte hai ki 'agar vidhansabha adhyaksh kii baat sahi maane ki baagi vidhayakon ne viniyog vidheyak ke paksh main matdaan kiya isliye yah paarit ho gaya he, tab baagi vidhayakon ko ayogy qaraar nahin diya ja saktaa
 ' spikar or congress ne kaha ki 9 sadsy virdohi dal ke saath rajbhavan matvibhaajan kii maang karne gaye the isliye unke vakeelon kii daleel sunne ke baad hi ayogy tehraaya gaya
 When the reporters asked why they were disqualified after the imposition of President's rule, the speaker said that they did not have written notice of imposition of President's rule
 yani sadsyta radd karne kaa sawaal ek sawaal he, yahaan sawaal he ki jab 35 sadsy kah rahe hai ki ve sarkaar ke saath nahin hai or sarkaar ke paas bahumat nahin he to spikar ne dhwani mat se paas hone kaa elaan kaise kar diya
 The speaker also said that if the members feel that the government is in minority then why did they not demand to prove majority in the House
 dhyaan rakhiyegaa ki jab vitt vidheyak sadan main gir jaataa he to wo bhi ek kism kaa avishvaas prastaav hi mana jaataa he
 We saw in the book Practice and Procedure of Parliament by MN Kaul and SL Shakadhar that we got the information about the rights of the speaker regarding the division of votes
 pej number 974 par mat vibhaajan kii sthiti main spikar ke adhikaar die gaye hai
 Page 974 lays down the Speaker's prerogative of not allowing the division of votes
 isamen kaha gaya he ki wois vot par spikar ke faisale ko bina chunauti die koi sadsy chaahe to spikar ko apana naam record karne ke liye anurodh kar saktaa he
 The speaker can accept the request if he feels the matter is important and there is a general opinion in its favor in the House
 pej 118 main kaha gaya he ki sadan ke andar spikar kaa adhikaar sarvocch he or ye adhikaar uski purna nishpakshta ke aadhaar par use hasil hota he
 The second paragraph of page 123 states that the speaker has many rights over the question of ministries
 haalanki sawaalon ko sweekaar karne ko lekar niyam banaae gaye hai lekin uski vyakhya kaa adhikaar spikar ke paas hota he
 The comments ek sawaal rajbhavan kii bhoomika ko lekar he
 The governor gave the first ten days for the government to prove its majority in the house
 phir rajyapal ne report bheji ki sanvaidhanik sankat he
 So did the Governor inform the Speaker that now they withdraw the proposal to prove majority or the Governor can send the report to whomever he wishes
 jab vidheyak gir gaya tha tab rajyapal ne sarkaar ko bahumat sabit karne kaa mauka kyon diya wo bhi das din
 The sting operation is being argued that a chief minister is seen talking about the transaction
 is lihaaz se to raashtrapati shashan bengal main lagu ho janaa chahie tha jahaan ke kai netaa mantri or saasand paise lete hue sting oparation main dikhte hai
 There were elections in Maharashtra on 15 October 2014
 usase ek maheenaa pehle 28 sitambar ko congress ensipi kaa gathbandhan tut gaya tha tab vahaan raashtrapati shashan laga tha
 The opposition fears that the BJP, which has been giving the slogan of collaborative federalism, is now cooperating in toppling the Union governments
 bijepi kah rahi he ki sanvaidhanik sankat he to kya karen
 In the Arunachal Pradesh case, this was alleged by the Congress, but it lost the case in the Supreme Court
 vahaan ab bijepi kii sarkaar he
 Along with the failure of the Appropriation Bill, the rules of division of votes and the right of the speaker have to be understood
 kya spikar baadhya he ki vah mat vibhaajan kii maang ko sweekaar hi karegaa or baadhya he to spikar manaa kar detaa he to uske kilaaf karrwai ke kya praavdhaan hai
 Whether the bill passed by the speaker with voice vote can be challenged
 rajyapal ne khaarij kar diya to yahaan kya rajyapal ko yah adhikaar he ki vah spikar ke faisle ko palat de
 i do not have all the answers, but the Finance Minister's blog is getting curious about many questions
 vitt mantri ne viniyog vidheyak ke bare main apane blog main likhaa he ki 'dhyaan dene vaali baat yah he ki aaj kii taarikh tak na to mukhyamantri na hi vidhansabha adhyaksh ne viniyog vidhi kii pramanit prati rajyapal ke paas nahin bheji he
 It is therefore natural that the Appropriation Bill has not been approved by the Governor
 ' Now the question arises whether the speaker or the Chief Minister had sent it to the Governor on March 18 after allegedly passing the Appropriation Bill by voice vote
 kya spikar yaa mukhyamantri ye tathy pesh kar sakate hai ki bheja tha
 The Finance Minister writes that he had not sent it and has not sent it till date
 lekin jis viniyog vidheyak ko lekar sarkaar gir gai or raashtrapati shashan lag gaya uske bare main rajyapal ne jaankaree kyon nahin maangi yaa maangi to nahin di gai
 Whether the entire decision was taken without looking at a certified copy of the appropriation bill or was it decided that a certified copy of the bill was not sent
 dainik uttarakhand, hindustan or amar ujaalaa ne is sawaal ko lekar khabar chhaapi thi
 According to different reports, the appropriation bill passed on March 18 was immediately sent by the speaker to the governor
 vitt mantri kehete hai ki aaj tak vidheyak kii pramanit prati nahin bheji gai
 According to the sources of our colleague Dinesh Mansera, a certified copy has been sent to the Raj Bhavan on March 28
 chunki ye jaankaree sutara aadhaarit he isliye ham is par daawa nahin kar sakate lekin agar ye sahi jaankaree he to viniyog vidheyak ko pramanik prati abhi kaise bheji gai
 Someone asked for it or the speaker thought of it
 aaj uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri harish ravat ne kaha ki rajyapal ko bheje gayi viniyog vidheyak main koi chhedchhad naa kii jaae or use usee rup main ab centre se paas karaayaa jaae kyonki ye ek bahumat vaali sarkaar kii ore se paas kiya gaya viniyog vidheyak he
 The Finance Minister further writes in his blog about the Appropriation Bill that the alleged discussion on the Appropriation Bill and all the facts related to its passage clearly point towards its passage
 ishaara karte hai yaa pakke taur par kehete hai ki viniyog vidheyak paas hi nahin hua
 Then why does the Finance Minister write in the next paragraph that 'there is a serious apprehension about the Appropriation Bill
 viniyog vidheyak paarit na hone par sarkaar ko 18 march ko hi istipha de dena chahie tha lekin usne aisa nahin kiya
 ' matvibhaajan hua yaa nahin, nahin hua to matvibhaajan main kaise yah vidheyak gir gaya
 Authentic copy of the Bill was sent to the Governor or not
 spikar ne vidheyak ko pramanit kiya yaa nahin kiya
 Either the appropriation bill is passed or not passed, but a third situation emerges here that there is a serious apprehension that it has passed
 jetali ne likhaa he ki har baat ke pramaan ke taur par dastauez maujuud hai
 It further writes that 'if the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly believes that the rebel mlas voted in favor of the Appropriation Bill, it has been passed, then the rebel mlas cannot be disqualified
 ' The Speaker and the Congress said that the Raj Bhavan along with the 9-member opposition party had gone to demand division, hence disqualified only after hearing the arguments of their lawyers
 patrakaron ne poocha ki raashtrapati shashan lagane ke baad kyon ayogy qaraar diya gaya to spikar ne kaha ki unhen raashtrapati shashan lagane kii likhit soochna nahin he
 That is, the question of cancellation of membership is a question, here is the question that when the 35 members are saying that they are not with the government and the government does not have majority, then how did the speaker declare to pass by voice vote
 spikar ne yah bhi kaha ki agar sadasyon ko lagata he ki sarkaar alpamat main he to unhone sadan main bahumat sabit karne kii maang kyon nahin kii
 Keep in mind that when the Finance Bill falls in the House, it is also considered a no-confidence motion
 hamane em en kaul or es el shakdhar kii kitaab practice and prosijar of parliament kitaab main jaakar dekha ki mat vibhaajan ko lekar spikar ke kya adhikaar hai to ye jaankaree mili
 The Speaker's powers are given on page number 974 in the event of division of votes
 pej 974 mat vibhaajan kii anumati nahin dene ke bare main spikar ke visheshadhikaar bataata he
 It states that a member may request the speaker to record his name without challenging the speaker's decision on the voice vote
 spikar chaahe to anurodh ko sweekaar kar saktaa he agar use lage to maamla mahatvapurn he or house main iske paksh main aam raay he
 Page 118 states that the Speaker's authority is supreme within the House and he gets these rights on the basis of his complete impartiality
 pej 123 kaa second para kahata he ki mantralayon ke sawaal par spikar ko kai adhikaar hasil hai
 Although rules have been made to accept the questions, the speaker has the right to interpret them
 tippaniyan One question is about the role of Raj Bhavan
 rajyapal ne pehle das din kaa samay diya ki sarkaar sadan main bahumat sabit kare
 Then the governor sent a report that there is a constitutional crisis
 to kya rajyapal ne spikar ko soochna di ki ab ve bahumat sabit karne kaa prastaav waapas lete hai yaa rajyapal jise chahen jo bhi report bhej sakate hai
 Why did the governor give the government a chance to prove its majority when the bill was dropped, that too ten days
 sting oparation kii daleel di ja rahi he ki ek mukhyamantri len dein kii baat karte dikh rahaa he
 In this sense, President's rule should have been implemented in Bengal where many of the leaders and ministers are seen in the sting operation taking money
 15 oktober 2014 ko maharashtra main chunaav the
 a month before that, on 28 September, the Congress ncp's alliance was broken when President's rule was imposed there
 vipaksh ko ashanka ho rahi he ki sahyogi sanghavaad kaa naaraa dene vaali bijepi ab sangh kii sarkaron ko giraane main sahyog karne lagi he
 BJP is asking what to do if there is a constitutional crisis
 arunachal pradesh ke maamle main congress ne yahi aarope lagaaya tha magar wo supreme court main mukadmaa haar gai
 There is now a BJP government
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki kya 18 march ko kathith rup se dhwani mat se viniyog vidheyak paas karaane ke baad spikar yaa mukhyamantri ne use rajyapal ke paas bheja tha
 Can the speaker or the chief minister present the fact that it was sent

 pej 123 kaa second para kahata he ki mantralayon ke sawaal par spikar ko kai adhikaar hasil hai
 Although rules have been made to accept the questions, the speaker has the right to interpret them
 tippaniyan One question is about the role of Raj Bhavan
 rajyapal ne pehle das din kaa samay diya ki sarkaar sadan main bahumat sabit kare
 Then the governor sent a report that there is a constitutional crisis
 to kya rajyapal ne spikar ko soochna di ki ab ve bahumat sabit karne kaa prastaav waapas lete hai yaa rajyapal jise chahen jo bhi report bhej sakate hai
 Why did the governor give the government a chance to prove its majority when the bill was dropped, that too ten days
 sting oparation kii daleel di ja rahi he ki ek mukhyamantri len dein kii baat karte dikh rahaa he
 In this sense, President's rule should have been implemented in Bengal where many of the leaders and ministers are seen in the sting operation taking money

 a month before that, on 28 September, the Congress ncp's alliance was broken when President's rule was imposed there

 spikar or congress ne kaha ki 9 sadsy virdohi dal ke saath rajbhavan matvibhaajan kii maang karne gaye the isliye unke vakeelon kii daleel sunne ke baad hi ayogy tehraaya gaya
 When the reporters asked why they were disqualified after the imposition of President's rule, the speaker said that they did not have written notice of imposition of President's rule
 yani sadsyta radd karne kaa sawaal ek sawaal he, yahaan sawaal he ki jab 35 sadsy kah rahe hai ki ve sarkaar ke saath nahin hai or sarkaar ke paas bahumat nahin he to spikar ne dhwani mat se paas hone kaa elaan kaise kar diya
 The speaker also said that if the members feel that the government is in minority then why did they not demand to prove majority in the House
 dhyaan rakhiyegaa ki jab vitt vidheyak sadan main gir jaataa he to wo bhi ek kism kaa avishvaas prastaav hi mana jaataa he
 We saw in the book Practice and Procedure of Parliament by MN Kaul and SL Shakadhar that we got the information about the rights of the speaker regarding the division of votes

 Page 974 lays down the Speaker's prerogative of not allowing the division of votes
 isamen kaha gaya he ki wois vot par spikar ke faisale ko bina chunauti die koi sadsy chaahe to spikar ko apana naam record karne ke liye anurodh kar saktaa he
 The speaker can accept the request if he feels the matter is important and there is a general opinion in its favor in the House
 pej 118 main kaha gaya he ki sadan ke andar spikar kaa adhikaar sarvocch he or ye adhikaar uski purna nishpakshta ke aadhaar par use hasil hota he
 The second paragraph of page 123 states that the speaker has many rights over the question of ministries
 haalanki sawaalon ko sweekaar karne ko lekar niyam banaae gaye hai lekin uski vyakhya kaa adhikaar spikar ke paas hota he
 The comments ek sawaal rajbhavan kii bhoomika ko lekar he
 The governor gave the first ten days for the government to prove its majority in the house
 phir rajyapal ne report bheji ki sanvaidhanik sankat he
 So did the Governor inform the Speaker that now they withdraw the proposal to prove majority or the Governor can send the report to whomever he wishes
 jab vidheyak gir gaya tha tab rajyapal ne sarkaar ko bahumat sabit karne kaa mauka kyon diya wo bhi das din
 The sting operation is being argued that a chief minister is seen talking about the transaction
