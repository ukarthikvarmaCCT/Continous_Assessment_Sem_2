 The Central Prasar Bharati Board has refused to accept the order of the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting that it terminate the services of all contract employees of Doordarshan and All India Radio

 Janata Party chief Subramanian Swamy has mentioned this in his personal complaint which he had given to former Telecom Minister

 Special CBI Judge Pradeep Chadha said, "notice is issued to the CBI to present a detailed report about its investigation and whether it has added to the aspect of national security that Swamy has raised

 Directing the CBI to react in the matter, the court scheduled the next hearing of the case on 23 February
 nyaayadhish ne sibiai ko notice jari karte hue kaha, ‘meraa maananaa he ki is adaalat ko philhal is maamle main aage nahin badhanaa chahie
 Meanwhile, Swamy said before the court that he wants to file an application and file a case against Tamil Nadu Chief Minister m Karunanidhi, including some others

 ab party main jane se pehle shishe main baar-baar apni dabl chin dekhakar pareshaan hone kii jarurat nahin he
 These quick makeup tricks will make your trouble easy
 
 
 1
 Keep the lower part of the chin slightly dark during makeup and match it with the color of your neck
 2
 Pay attention to the make-up of the throat and eyes while doing the makeup so that it looks flushed
 isse logon kaa dhyaan aapaki chin se hat jayega or cheharaa sundar dikhne lagegaa
 3
 chehre kii jo line par dhyaan dena bhi jaruri he
 Double chins do not get much attention even if they are embossed through makeup

 Wear some jewelery around your neck
 necoles kii sundar dizin yaa phir sone ke taron se bani chen logon kaa dabl chin se dhyaan hataane kaa kaam karegi

 Depending on the shape of the face, you can also take the help of a hairstylist
 madhya pradesh main uria ko lekar bavaal thamane kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 During the distribution of fertilizers in Guna district on Monday, the uproar increased so much that the police had to stick sticks on the farmers who were creating an uproar
 in dinon rajya ke anya kshetron kii tarah guna main bhi khaad ko lekar maaramaari machi hui he
 Not only in the fold but also in Chhatarpur district, there is anger among the farmers about the distribution of fertilizer and they created a tremendous uproar
 guna ke nanakhedi krishi upaj mandi main somvaar ko kisaan line laga kar khaad le rahe the
 Due to the delay in sharing the fertilizer, the farmers were patiently responded and they started committing uproar
 hangaamaa badhate dekh police ne lathicharge kar kisaanon ko khadeda
 Senior Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia is an MP from Guna and in his own constituency, farmers are struggling for urea
 sirf guna hi nahi balki chhatarpur jile main bhi khaad ko lekar jabardast hangaamaa hua
 For the sake of manure, the farmers, queuing up in the long queue, got angry after delay and parked the tractors on the National Highway in front of the Kisan Suvidha Kendra
 maamle kii jaankaree milte hi pulicekarmiyon ne samajhaboojh ke saath maamla shant karavaaya or jam khulwaaya
 The crisis will end soon
 On the other hand, the new government of Madhya Pradesh claims that the Urea crisis in the state is expected to end gradually after continuous talks with the Center
 krishi vibhaag se mili jaankaree ke mutabik kendriya urvarak evam rasayan mantralay ne 25 hajaar metric ton uria kii aapurti tatkaal kiye jane kii sahmati di he
 According to the department, in Madhya Pradesh, about 2 lakh 15 thousand metric tons of urea has been supplied so far in December, while about 50 thousand metric tons of urea is going to reach the state
 iske alaava rajya shashan ne centre se NFL vijaipur, guna plant se milane vaale uria ko madhya pradesh main hi baantne kaa anurodh kiya he
 According to the department, Madhya Pradesh was getting 6 to 7 rakes of urea daily which has now increased to 10 rakes
 varsh 2013-14 kaa bajet chunaavon ke pehle kaa antim bajet he
 The government's reform efforts are in its infancy and it is resorting to extravagant populism in the close years of elections
 upie-2 ne vyaavhaarik samajhadaari ko sir ke bal ulataa kar diya he or antim kuch maheenon main apni chhavi sudhaarney ke liye tatpar dikhnaa chaahati he
 The discussion of the 100-day action plan in 2009 caught on, but proved to be airborne
 aakhir pramukh aadchan kya he? 2003 se 2007 ke bich ke oonchi vruddhi dar vaale daur main bachat / nivesh kii dar bhi oonchi dekhi gai thi lekin gaiyr-utpaadak sarkari kharchon kii vajah se iskaa koi phayda nahin mil paaya
 There is a direct relationship between financial strength and growth
 sarkaar ke nirnay lene main deree se upji van / paryaavaran manjuuri or bhoomi adhigrahan kii samasya ne kodh main khaaj kaa kaam kiya
 Coalition politics and the hurdle of Parliament are actually an excuse that bypasses the real issue
 sudhaaron ke liye mahaj do binduon vaala agenda hona chahieh nivesh main phir se teji laaen or sarkari kharchon main katautee karen
 The introduction of FDI, pension and insurance in retail may have made the heart of foreign investors and rating agencies, but it did not resolve any issues
 bajet 2013-14 paanch ke aasapaas kii sankhyaon ke bare main hoga
 First, increase 5
 5 fisadi ke aasapaas ghist rahi he
 The Greek / Mali cannot be blamed for this or the nine per cent move cannot be regained simply by wishing about the inevitable need to improve the economy
 nau fisadi ke liye garibi / berogari main kami lani hogi
 Worries are not only about sexual offenses and corruption on the streets, but also about slowing down of economic growth and fading of economic opportunities
 ek tarah se dekhen to har bajet 14
 Projects a nominal growth of 5 percent
 7
 Considering the real growth of 5 per cent and inflation of 7 per cent, it is probably no different
 duusari baat, mahangaai kaa ek aankada he jise sarkaar adarsh taur par 5 ke aasapaas rakhana chaahati he
 This is the dream of the government
 krishi main kisi tarah ke sudhaar na hone se krishi utpaadan main vruddhi nahin ho paa rahi he
 Manufacturing supply is also not increasing due to bottlenecks in investment and the sector is facing further problems due to high raw material costs
 aaayaatit mahangaai par to sarkaar kaa bahut kam niyantran hota he
 Lastly, increasing government spending is rarely appreciated because it brings cash into the system and increases inflation
 is tarah hamaare paas ek teesraa paanch ke aasapaas kaa aankada bachataa he, vittiya ghaataa / jidipi kaa anupaat
 The Finance Minister will try to ensure that this 5 in the revised estimate for 2012-13
 3 fisadi par rahe or 2013-14 ke bajet anumaanon main ise or ghataate hue 5 fisadi tak le jaaya jaae
 There has been considerable discussion of direct cash transfers and uids as a means of major reforms in the subsidized phase
 abhi tak cash transfar ko scolership / pension tak simit rakhaa gaya he or yuidi lagu hone kii kai samasyaon main ulajh gaya he
 There are some efforts going on towards subsidizing petroleum products, but there is no indication of ending or overhauling the government-controlled pricing mechanism and targeting subsidies with BPL ID cards
 khaadya sabsidi bill ke kai praroopon ko dekhakar to yahi lagata he ki yah yojana lakshith tareeke apnaane se kaaphi dur he
 So, as a small point, the proposed changes will only hurt the budgetary subsidy bill (if something like this happens)
 ek bade bindu ke rup main in bahucharchit sudhaaron main prachaar zyada he, tatv kam
 After all, how will the Finance Minister manage the data? It is not difficult
 bas kharchon kaa bajet ghataaen or nirdayatapurvak mantralayon ke anudaan main katautee karen
 Estimate all receipts, including non-tax
 behatar he ki aankadon kii baazeegari kaa sahaara len
 Suggestions to raise tax rates are also coming up
 yah maujuuda pradhanmantri or maujuuda vitt mantri dwaara 1991, 1995 or 1997 main vitt mantri ke rup main di gai daleel ke vipareet he
 The system of high rates does not work
 durbhaagya se gramin aamadani ko bilkul nahin chuaa jaataa he
 For the remaining 70 million urban households, the tax base should be increased by increasing the tax base, not by raising rates
 aadhaar badhaane ke baad chhuton ko bhi khatm karne kaa number aata he
 Some tax exemptions can be eliminated in this budget, but the postponement of both cash transfer and GST is unlikely to eliminate tax exemptions in a big way
 isliye daren badhaane kii aakarshak sambhaavna ke liye laar tapakaai ja sakati he, bhale hi ses / sarcharge ke chhadam raste se aisa kiya jaae
 There is no doubt that tax evasion happens, but it is done in a statutory manner, taking advantage of exemptions to a large extent
 isko nazarandaaj kar, vetanbhogi varg (jo chhuton kaa istemaal nahin kar saktaa) ko nishaanaa banaakar or saarvajanik kharche badhaakar upie-2 sarkaar lagaataar 1970 ke dashak kii yaad dilaa rahi he
 Increasing government intervention in other things also confirms this
 yadi ham ’70 ke dashak ke growth rate tak pahunch jaaen to koi achraj kii baat nahin hogi

 '' Shah Faisal's plea to state government rejected In response to the habeas corpus petition, the Jammu Kashmir administration has filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court

 In support of this argument, the administration told the court that Shah Faisal had obtained a tourist visa, not a student visa

 The state administration has stated that a B1 / B2 visa has been pasted on their passports, which does not give them the right to study in the USA due to not having a student visa

 Even after being warned, they continued the activities which left the atmosphere uncontrolled
 halafname main ye bhi kaha gaya ki 14 agast ko unke bhaashan or anya gatividhiyon kii vajah se shanti bhang hone kii ashanka bad gai thi
 Therefore, the magistrate offered to release the arrested Faisal on condition of maintaining peace by giving bond and security of Rs 50,000

 On this, the magistrate ordered him to be kept in custody and on August 24, the matter was listed for hearing

 san 1998 ke ant tak pakistani khufia agency inter-services intelligence (iesai) ne samaj liya tha ki uske liye harakat-ul-mujahidin kaa samarthan jari rakhana arthhin he
 The Mujahideen was the target of US security agencies as its commander, Maulana Fazlur Rahman Khalil, issued a fatwa against the US shaking hands with Osama bin Laden's al-qaeda
 iske baad se uske khilaaf karrwai ke liye america pakistan par dabaav bana rahaa tha
 Subsequently, ISI placed bets on 31 December 1999 in view of the release of Masood Azhar from India in exchange for passengers on Indian Airlines hijacked flight IC-814 and his height in the jihadi circles of Pakistan
 karachi kii binori masjid main devbandi ulema par dabaav daalkar iesai ne masood ajahar ko unka netaa banavaa diya or is tarah 31 janvari, 2000 ko jaish-e-mohammad kaa janm hua
 In order to advance Masood, when the ISI proposed to make him a common leader of Pakistan-based jihadist groups, he was called Syed Salahuddin of hizb-ul-mujahideen, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed of lashkar-e-taiba (let) and Harkat-ul- The Mujahideen faced stiff resistance from Khalil
 ye sabhi samooh pakistani satta pratishthan ke sudrudh sangrakshan kaa anand lete hai or unamem se koi bhi hathiyaaron kii aapurti, vittiya samarthan or sena se mili suraksha ko khona nahin chahta tha
 In such a situation, they had to accept ISI to some extent
 masood kii madad karne ke kram main iesai ne harakat-ul-mujahidin ke sadasyon par masood ke paksh main nishthaaen badalane kaa dabaav bhi daalaa or pakistan tathaa pakistani kabje vaale kashmir main prashikshan shiviron, vittiya sansadhano tathaa hathiyaaron par masood kaa niyantran sthapit karavaaya
 The entire harkat-ul-mujahideen in the valley turned into jaish-e-muhammad overnight
 jaish-e-mohammad or lashkar-e-taiyaba ke bich pakistan se chal rahi pratidwandvita jammu-kashmir or shesh bharat tak fail gai
 The rivalry continues to this day in the form of distorted terrorist competition, which group can carry out big audacious attacks to appease their masters hiding in Pakistan's lap
 unke liye har safal hamale kaa arth he adhik bhartiyon, dhan or rutaba
 jaish-e-muhammad announced his presence in Kashmir with a suicide car bomb attack on December 25, 2000 at the headquarters of the 15th Corps Headquarters of the Army's Badami Bagh cantonment in Srinagar
 sena mukhyalay ko hi hamale ke liye chunane kii vajah yah thi ki kuch din pehle 23 november, 2000 ko lashkar ne bhi chhavnee ko nishaanaa banaaya tha or sena ke nihathe jansampark adhikari or sahyogiyon kii hatya kar di thi
 When Masood used to spew venom against India in Pakistan with the aim of instigating, recruiting, and instigating violence in Kashmir by inspiring them, then his chief commander in the valley, Tahir Nadeem Rana alias Ghazi Baba, was carrying out a series of deadly attacks
 gaji baba or masood, donon pakistani punjab main bahawalpur ke the
 Ghazi Baba became the most wanted terrorist in the Valley after the attack on Jammu and Kashmir Assembly on 1 October 2001

 By that time, all security agencies in Kashmir had made inroads into its organization
 usee daur main 28 disambar, 2003 ko pakistan ke purv raashtrapati parvej musharraf kii hatya ke prayaas main shaamil hone kaa andeh hone ke baad iesai ne is sanghathan par shikanja kas diya
 However, when the ISI later realized that it was not right for him to depend on only one group lashkar-e-taiba, he changed his policy and relaxed restrictions on the jaish-e-muhammad
 pratibandh deele hone ke baad se jaish-e-mohammad phir se kukhyati hasil karne kii ore he or pulavama hamalaa uskaa naveenatam dussahas he
 The attack has serious security implications as it has a new dimension of involvement of local youth which will help in protecting Pakistan from allegations of its involvement

 ’ New bottlenecks are coming to the fore in ahmedabad-mumbai Bullet train project being made in collaboration with India and Japan
 mumbai main ho rahe virodh ke baad ab is project ke virodh main 1000 kisaanon ne gujarat main hai court kaa rukh kiya he
 These farmers have given an affidavit and appealed to the court to stop the work of bullet train
 1
 The National High Speed rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) is taking forward this project costing Rs 08 lakh crore
 is project ke fund kaa 80 fisadi hissaa japan nebharatako soft lone ke tahat uplabdh karaayaa he
 The project requires about 1,400 hectares of land in Gujarat and Maharashtra
 isamen se 1,120 hectare jameen privet oner ke paas he
 The governments of both states have to acquire this land
 is jameen ke badale main kareeb 6,000 logon ko muaavja diya janaa he
 The appeal of five Surat farmers is already being heard in the Gujarat High Court
 in kisaanon ne gujarat sarkaar ke jameen adhigrahan ke tareeke kaa virodh kiya he
 After this, 1,000 farmers have now said that they do not want to give their land for this project
 in kisaanon kaa kahana he ki jameen kaa adhigrahan karne main dishanirdeshon kaa ulanghan kiya ja rahaa he
 The farmers refer to the directions of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which funds the project
 isamen adhigrahan ke paryavaraniya or saamaajik prabhaav kii samiksha ke liye cametiyaan banane kii baat kahi gai he, jo ki is maamle main dekhne ko nahin mila he
 Farmers say that they are not getting enough compensation from this
 kisaanon kii maang he ki is project ke liye centre sarkaar jameen kaa adhigrahan karen
 According to the farmers, since the land has to be acquired in two states, the center should join it and the farmers of both the states get compensation at the same rate
 kisaanon ne 2016 main gujarat sarkaar par jameen adhigrahan niyam (2013) ko kamjor karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya he
 Explain that now farmers can also go to the Supreme Court against the central government's stand
 inkaa kahana he ki centre jaanboojhkar gujarat hai court main apana jawaab daakhil karne main der kar rahaa he

 maharashtra keefdanvis sarkaar ke vishwaas matko lekar vidhansabha main aaj jabardast hangaamaa hua
 Shiv Sena and Congress leaders, who were opposing the trust vote, stopped the governor's car outside the assembly in Mumbai and shouted slogans of Governor Go Back
 is dauraan governor ko thodi chot bhi ai
 Five Congress mlas have been suspended for two years on charges of stopping the governor's car
 vishwaas mat prastaavpar voting kii maang ko lekar hangaamaa kar rahe vipakshi netaaon ne rajyapal vidyasagar raav ko vidhansabha main jane se roka
 The governor was going to address the assembly
 chaaron taraf se ghir gaye rajyapal ko dhakka mukki kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 It was difficult for the security personnel to remove the legislators
 is dauraan rajyapal ke haath main chot bhi lagi
 The governor was somehow brought inside the house
 vipaksh ke netaaon ne sadan ke andar bhi rajyapal ke khilaaf narebaaji kii
 Opposition leaders shouted slogans from the Governor back inside the House as well
 haalanki hangaame ke bich rajyapal ne abhibhaashan puraa kiya
 Later Congress mlas Rahul Bondre, Abdul Sattar, Amar Kale, Virendra Jagtap and Jai Kumar Gore were suspended
 congress-shivasena kaa dharnafadanvis sarkaar ke vishwaas mat par vivaad us vakt khadaa ho gaya jab ise sadan main dhwani mat se paarit kiya gaya
 Congress and Shivasainane gave a house in the assembly and again demanded a motion of confidence
 congress ne aarope lagaaya ki bahumat sanvaidhanik tareeke se hasil nahin kiya gaya
 At the same time, Shiv Sena has challenged to present a trust vote again
 spikar ne di safaividhansabha ke nae navele spikar haribhaau bagade ne puure maamle par apni safai di he
 He has said that Shiv Sena and Congress did not raise objections while proceedings were going on in the House
 jab unhone poocha ki kya vishwaas prastaav par kisi kaa virodh he to unhone us vakt kuch nahin kaha
 But when the speaker took the decision, then he has been questioned and the Congress is opposing because he has not got the post of Leader of Opposition
 trephic rules logon kii suraksha ke liye banaae gaye hai, lekin bahut se log inkaa paalan nahin karte or jahaan trephic police najar nahin aati vahaan in niyamon kaa khulkar ulanghan karte hai
 In such a situation, the Bangalore Police has taken an initiative by taking a very unique command
 darasal, bengalooru police ne putalon ko trephic police kii vardi pahaanakar sadakon par tainaat kar diya he, taaki log unhen trephic police samajhakar niyamon kaa ulanghan na karen
 According to the news, initially the Bangalore Police has put 30 mannequins in traffic uniforms in different places in the city
 police kaa maananaa he ki aisa karne se log trephic niyamon kaa paalan karenge
 These mannequins are worn in reflective jackets, white shirts, khaki pants, hats and black shoes, standing in different places of the city and changing their place from time to time so that people are not used to it
 bataa den, 1 karod 20 lakh kii aabaadi vaale shahar bengalooru kii sadakon par lagbhag 71 lakh vaahan daudte he, jinase har saal trephic police 1 karod se lekar 1 karod 5 lakh rupeya kaa chalaan vasuulati he
 Police say that instead of collecting challans, the priority is to prevent accidents
 aise main jab bhi koi nayaa idia saamne aata he police usko apanaati he
 According to the Bengaluru Mirror report, mannequins are used only during the day and are removed at night
 bengalooru police ke is pahal kii twitor par kuch log saraahna kar rahe hai to kuch is par alag-alag tarah se riect kar rahe hai
 See Tweets While it is an interesting idea, it will most likely fail because this mannequin looks fitter than all the cops
 May be they should add a bit of a paunch to make it more realistic
 i think it is good experiment
 Keep shifting the mannequin frequently to different locations
 Looks like our very own Michael jaykishan
 Moonwalk plz
 i hope 'fair & Handsome' is underwriting this
 haalanki, yah pehali baar nahin he jab police ne is tarah kaa koi kadam uthaaya he
 The police always makes people aware of traffic rules in some way

 20 fisadi kii dar se gro kar rahi he
 (these figures https: / / tradingeconomics from the year 2018-2019

 ) Please tell here that the scale of deciding the GDP of each country is different
 bharat main kendriya sankhyikee karyaalay yani siesao utpaadan or sevaaon ke moolyankan ke liye ek aadhaar varsh yani base year tay karata he
 See in Graphics India's GDP is GDP and how you are affected
 Actually, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the most important measure of measuring the economic health of any country
 jidipi kisi khaas avadhi ke dauraan desh ke bheetar vastu or sevaaon ke production kii kul keemat he
 GDP in India is calculated on a quarterly basis every third month
 agar jidipi kaa aankada badhata he to iskaa matlab yah hota he ki desh kii vikaas kii raftaar trek par aage bad rahi he
 At the same time, if these figures are continuously low, then there is a danger bell for the country
 jidipi kam hone kii vajah se logon kii ausat aay kam ho jaati he or log garibi rekha ke neeche chale jate hai
 Apart from this, the pace of creation of new jobs is also reduced

 Rohini court has ordered registration of FIR against Aam Aadmi Party leader Ashutosh
 darasal gandhi, nehru or atal bihari bajpeyi ke khilaaf abhadra tippanee karne ke maamle main rohinee court kii jaj ekta gaba ne begumpur ke esechao ko exiaar karne kaa aadesh diya he
 The case dates back to 2016 when Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal removed him from the cabinet after Aam Aadmi Party minister Sandeep Kumar's pornographic CD surfaced 
 kejariwal ne kaha tha ki unhone apni party se ‘gandi machhlee’ ko baahar nikaal diya he
 Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Ashutosh had defended Sandeep Kumar, saying that Sandeep has done nothing wrong, the father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee also went beyond the social and moral realm
 There have been relationships with women
 ashutosh kii is tippanee par bijepi samet congress ne kadi aalochana kii thi
 After this dispute, an application was filed in the Rohini court, alleging that the people were hurt by the feelings of the common people, and filed an FIR
 jis par court ne ab police ko exiaar darj karne ke aadesh die hai
 It is also worth noting that when this CD was Kandhua, Arvind Kejriwal himself called Sandeep Kumar a dirty fish
 lekin us vakt sandip kumaar kaa bachaav karne vaale ashutosh haal hi main balaatkaar ke doshiyon ko faansee kii sajaa kii mukhaalafat karte bhi najar aaye the, jis vajah se unki bahut aalochana bhi hui thi
 Economy must have done more than politics affects our life, but when it is going through a crisis, there is a chance to understand what happened in the last three years that we have reached this point, then politics has Have found a hindu-muslim topic
 aaj bhi aap tamaam channelon par dekh sakate hai kisi na kisi rup main hindu muslim topic kii charchaa he
 It is not necessary that whatever is the crisis today, it should remain tomorrow
 magar jo aaj he, uski baat to honi chahie
 Our economy is going through a period of crisis
 bazaar or bijness main baari giravat he
 Employment opportunities are being affected by this
 kya in sawaalon ko taalane ke liye godi media lagaataar hindu muslim topic main ghusaa hua he
 As much as i talk to businessmen, chartered accountants and tax lawyers about GST, it seems that as a journalist i am not able to reach even one percent of this problem
 zaahir sankat bada he or aayam bhi bahut hai
 Today we spoke to Satish Gupta of Tax Consultant Association of Rajasthan
 unase jo input yani feedback mila he, wo main yahaan ek suchi ke rup main pesh karnaa chahta hum
 Even after September 20 in Jaipur, the portal was not functioning properly
 puure din massej aate rahaa ki aap qataar main he, din biit gaya qataar nahin beetaa
 Tax lawyers and cas are all working under pressure with traders
 acha hota masik kii jagah tremasik ritern bharne kii vyavastha hoti
 The port is in English only, due to which traders are unable to understand or fill it
 galati se batan sabamit ho gaya to sudhaar karne kii koi guzaaish nahin he
 For example, if any amount is deposited in some other item, then it is not getting a chance to improve
 sarkaar kahati hi 3 bi farm bharne kii deree par jurmaana nahin lagegaa, magar liya ja rahaa he
 There is a fine of 200 rupees for one day delay
 aksar portal ke kaaran farm bharne main deree ho rahi he, tab bhi jurmaana lag rahaa he
 The assumption is not correct that CA and tax lawyers are having fun for this reason, but the fact is that they are also very upset
 vyapaariyon kii pareshaani to or bhi badi he
 There was no habit of dealing with the bill and now they are worried about handling the bill
 jin vyapaariyon kaa set ap bada he yani jinke yahaan acountint vagairah kaa system he unhen kam pareshaani he lekin general store, medical store yaa kisi bhi retail bijness waalon ke liye jiesti ne saradard badha diya he
 These people have five hundred thousand bills, which takes several hours to fill the information
 pehle vyapaaree sie ko puure saal kaa 1500 rupee dekar kaam chalaa letaa tha ab use puure saal ke liye bees se pachis hazaar rupee dene pad rahe hai
 GST has upset small and medium-sized businessmen and entrepreneurs
 ve bazaar main tikenge yaa nahin, ye sawaal khadaa ho gaya he
 We asked a question as to why traders filled on the last day, so the answer was phir aap bataaiye ki ye last date rakhaa hi kyon hai
 Why your system is not ready according to the last date
 kya vyapaaree sara kaam chhodkar ritern hi bharwata rahe? saare vyapaaree khud se jiesti nahin bhar sakate hai? Talking to the tax consultant revealed that the situation is worse in small towns
 internet chalata nahin, chalata he to slo chalata he
 Many times the system does not accept when you migrate online by filling an offline form
 haalat yah he ki 250 client hai, magar teen chaar din lagane ke baad bhi 50% kii jiesti nahin bhari ja saki
 Merchants are raising the problem of refunds a lot
 kah rahe hai ki jab july kaa rifund 10 november ke baad milegaa to agast-sitambar or oktober kaa rifund to agle saal march ke baad milegaa
 Because of this, there is no money in the hands of traders
 har level par pement atka hua he
 Those who have taken loans from the bank, they will also pay separate interest later
 hamane akhil bhartiya transport sangh ke ek padaadhikari se baat kii unhone hamen jo bataaya use suchi baddh kar rahaa hum
 The condition of the transport sector has worsened since the introduction of GST
 july main to ghandha ghatakar 20 fisadi par aa gaya tha, agast main 50 fisadi tak aayaa
 60 percent reached in September but still 30-40 percent business down
 trakon ke phere ke samay main bhi khaas antar nahin aayaa he kyonki maharashtra ko chhod oktry har jagah se hat gaya tha
 The arrival time of the truck on the Delhi Mumbai route has reduced by ten hours
 iske kai kaaran he
 Still a large number of traders have not been registered
 bina registration ke transporter unka maal nahin uthaa saktaa kyonki pakadaa jayega
 The New Testament is like this
 phir bhi jinhone registration nahin karaayaa he, unka maal yahaan se vahaan ja to rahaa he
 How is it happening aise ho rahaa he ki iske liye jokhim uthaane vaale transporter dugana tiguna charge kar rahe hai
 At this time the government is not in a position to check
 lekin bahut badi sankhya main transporter chaahate hai ki registration vaale vyapaaree kaa hi maal uthaaen, magar jin logon ne registration karaayaa he unka bijness 40 se 50 fisadi kam ho gaya he
 The transporter is not getting orders from them
 isliye godaamon main trek badi sankhya main khaali khadey hai jo kisi bijness yaa arthvyavastha ke liye shubh sanket nahin he
 The downsizing of trucks has further impacted the trucks
 jaise dilli se jo trek maal kar dakshin kii taraf gaye hai, vahaan jaakar atak gaye hai
 Because the factories there are down production, trucks are not getting the goods
 isliye vaapasi kii jagah ve hafte bhar se dakshin ke shaharon main atake hai
 The transporter said that at least 1000 to 2000 trucks will be stuck in Delhi
 diwali ke sizan main aisa kabhi nahin hota tha
 This is just a matter of truck, if you include the trailer, small truck, tampo used in transport, then the picture will look something else
 hamane ye sabhi baaten baatcheet ke aadhaar par likhi hai jisase pataa chale ki zamin par kya ho rahaa he
 None of the traders said that they do not want to pay tax
 sab dena chaahate hai magar prakriya or karon kii dar se kaaphi pareshaan hai
 i spoke to representatives of some trade associations in Rajasthan over the phone
 rajasthan main marble, handi craft or gold jewelri kaa kaarobaar kaaphi ahm rakhata he
 The first has a GST of 28 per cent on both and 3 per cent GST on gold jewelery
 steel sangh ke seetaram agarwal sahab ne kaha ki hamaara bijness 40 percent down ho gaya he
 Sales of TMT bars, angles, panels have all been very low
 factriyon main jahaan teen shift chal rahi thi vahaan do shift chal rahi he
 The overtime earns less because the overtime is closed or less
 har sector main dihadi mazaduron ko kaam nahin mil rahaa he, sabase prabhavit yahi he
 As such, the steel sector accounts for 39 per cent of the banks' npas
 rajasthan main petrol or deazal kii khapat main saadhe chah fisadi kii kami aa gai he
 We give positive suggestions to the government, but there is no action
 sthaneey str par samasyaon kaa nidaan to band hi ho gaya he
 Similarly we talked to a businessman who made fancy items by carving stones from Jaipur
 naam na bataane kii shart par kaha ki unke bijness main 80 fisadi kii giravat ai he
 Due to 28 per cent GST, things became so expensive that people stopped buying amateur
 pehle maheene kaa bijness pachaas se saath lakh kaa hota tha jo ab ghatakar das se 15 lakh par aa gaya he
 This has impacted employment
 unhone bataaya ki Those who were expensive and permanent accountants in our factory had to be removed
 aise kai logon kii chantni kii or unki jagah part time kaam liya
 There were three contractors, each with 10 to 15 laborers working
 pehle maheene hi do kantrector ko waapas bhej diya, ab bulaayaa he
 But now no contractor has more than two to three laborers, ie 10 to 12 laborers have been lost
 ham jiesti kii samasya ko portal tak hi simit na rakhen, iske kaaran vyapaar jo manda padaa he or dihadi par kamaane waalon ke haath se jo kaam chhina he, uskaa koi hisaab nahin he
 The arrival of a system and a three-taxed GST was welcomed like the midnight of 15 August 1947, due to the GST, those who have suffered injuries on their stomachs should not be called and honored in Parliament
 pichhali baar prime time main jab ham bank hadtaal par baat kar rahe the to ek awaz sunai di ki banking sector main naukariyaan kam ho gai hai
 Normally till this year the bank informs IBPS for the recruitment, this institution called Institute of Banking Personal Selection conducts the examination for the recruitment in the bank services
 ai bi pi es kii website se jo data mila he, use dekhte hai
 In 2015, advertisements for recruitment of 24, 604 clerks were released
 2016 main 19, 243 clerkon kii bhartee kaa vigyaapan niklaa
 The recruitment of clerks decreased by 5,361 in one year
 2017 main 7,883 clerkon kii bhartee kii vekainsee ai he
 Between 2016 and 17, 11,360 posts were reduced
 2015 kii tulana main saulah hazaar vaikency kam ho gai he
 The young man stands in the desert of unemployment today and your leader is talking about the graveyard
 isse saaf saaf or isse zyaada kuch nahin kah saktaa
 Now comes the number of Probationer Officer P
O
 yahaan bhi kahani dukhad he
 In 2015, there were 12,434 posts of pos
 2016 main sidhaa 3612 kam ho kar 8,822 ho gaya
 In 2017, only 3,562 PO vacancies have come out
 yani 2015 kii tulana main 2017 main kareeb 9000 kam vekainsee ai he
 Today's Indian Express has published a report on Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana
 anchal magazine or anil sasi kii report aap bhi padhiyegaa
 The Ministry of Skill Development is reviewing demand and supply at the district level, collecting data
 july 2017 ke pehle hafte tak ke data ko dekhne ke baad jo tasviir saamne aa rahi he wo bhayaavah he
 The same shows why the media does not talk about employment, why Hindu talks about Muslim topics
 express kii is report main likhaa he kitippaniyan So far, under the skill development scheme, 30 lakh 67 thousand people have been trained or were being given
 inamen se maatr 2 lakh 90 hazaar ko hi kaam mila he
 There is a target of training one crore youth in four years under this scheme of 12,000 crores
 ab ye chintan ho rahaa he ki kahin training kii quality to ausat nahin he
 But was the quality so average that even out of 30 lakh three lakhs did not get employment, then what was right under this scheme? kya yah aankada daraane vaala nahin he, kya ab bhi aap naujavaanon ke bhavishya kii chintaa chhodkar hindu muslim taapic par bahes dekhnaa chahenge
 What to do, whether to riot the youth or to make them citizens
 hamaare desh main rojgaar ko lekar koi vishwasaneey or paardarshee data system nahin he
 App for so many things are made, an app would be made by it, which shows that this month which department of the center or which department of state governments have taken out jobs
 magar sarkarein nahin bataaengi kyonki aap hakeekat jaan jaaenge
 See the report of Sushil Mahapatra, what do the recycling factory say on the impact of GST
 jaipur main 20 sitambar ke baad bhi portal sahi se kaam nahin kar rahaa tha
 The message kept coming throughout the day that you are in queue, the day has not passed
 vyapaariyon ke saath tex vakil or sie sabhi dabaav main kaam kar rahe hai
 It would have been better to have a quarterly return filing instead of monthly
 port sirf angrezi main he, iske kaaran vyapaaree na samaj paa rahe hai na bhar paa rahe hai
 There is no room for correction if the button is submitted by mistake
 jaise koi rakam, kisi duusare mad main jamaa ho jaae to use sudhaarney kaa mauka nahin mil rahaa he
 As soon as the government says, there will be no penalty for delay in filling the 3B form, but it is being taken
 ek din kii deree par 200 rupee jurmaana he
 Often due to the portal there is a delay in filling the form, even then there is a penalty
 yah dharna sahi nahin he ki is kaaran se sie or tex vakil mouj kar rahe hai balki hakeekat yah he ki ve bhi kaaphi pareshaan hai
 The trouble of traders is even greater
 bill se dhandha karne kii aadat nahin thi or ab bill sambhalate sambhalate pareshaan hai
 Merchants who have a large set up, ie those who have a system of accountants, etc
 have less trouble but GST has increased the headache for the general store, medical store or any retail business
 in logon ke paas paanch sau hazaar kii sankhya main bill hote hai, jisaki soochna bharte bharte kai ghante lag jate hai
 Previously, the merchant used to pay CA for a full year Rs 1500, now he has to pay twenty to twenty five thousand rupees for the whole year
 jiesti ne laghu va madhyam shrenee ke bijnesaman or udhyamiyon ko pareshaan kar diya he
 The question has arisen whether they will survive in the market or not
 hamane ek sawaal poocha ki aakhri din vyapaaree kyon bharte hai to iskaa jawaab yun mila Then you tell me why these last dates are kept
 aapkaa system last date ke hisaab se taiyaar kyon nahin he
 Should the merchant leave all the work and get the returns filled? Can not all traders fill GST by themselves? tex conslatent se baat karne par pataa chalaa ki chote shaharon main sthiti or bhi karaab he
 Internet does not work, but it runs slow
 ofline form bharkar jab aap online main migrat karaate hai to kai baar system sweekaar nahin karata he
 The condition is that there are 250 clients, but even after three to four days GST of 50% could not be filled
 rifund kii samasya vyapaaree khub uthaa rahe hai
 They are saying that when July refunds will be received after November 10, then august-september and October refunds will be available after March next year
 is kaaran vyapaariyon ke haath main paisa hi nahin he
 Payment is stuck at every level
 jinhone bank se lone liye hai, wo baad main alag se byaaz bhi bharenge
 We spoke to an officer of the All India Transport Association, listing what they told us
 jiesti ke aane ke baad se transport sector kii haalat or karaab ho gai he
 In July, the turnover had come down to 20 percent, in August it came to 50 percent
 sitambar main 60 fisadi tak pahunchaa he magar ab bhi 30-40 fisadi bijness down he
 There has not been a significant difference in the timing of the trucks' rounds as the octroi had moved everywhere except Maharashtra
 dilli mumbai root par zarur trek ke pahunchane ke samay main das ghante kii kami ai he
 There are several reasons for this
 abhi bhi badi sankhya main vyapaariyon kaa registration nahin hua he
 Without registration the transporter cannot pick up their cargo because it will be caught
 nayaa niyam aisa hi he
 Still, the goods of those who have not been registered are going from here to there
 kaise ho rahaa he
 It is happening that the transporters taking the risk for this are charging twice as much
 is vakt sarkaar checking karne kii sthiti main nahin he
 But a large number of transporters want only the registered merchants to pick up the goods, but the business of those who have registered has reduced by 40 to 50 percent
 unke paas se transporter ko order nahin mil rahaa he
 Therefore trucks in warehouses are standing in large numbers which is not a good sign for any business or economy
 bijness down hone kaa trakon par or asar padaa he
 For example, trucks from Delhi which have gone south due to freight, are stuck there
 kyonki vahaan kii factriyon main utpaadan down he, trakon ko maal nahin mil rahaa he
 Therefore, instead of returning, they have been stuck in the cities of the south for a week
 transporter ne bataaya ki kam se kam 1000 se lekar 2000 tak trek dilli ke vahaan atake honge
 This never happened in the Diwali season
 ye sirf trek kii baat he, agar aap isamen transport main istamaal hone vaali trailor,chote trek, tampo ko bhi shaamil karenge to tasviir kuch or nazar aegi
 We have written all these things on the basis of conversation so that we know what is happening on the ground
 kisi bhi vyapaaree ne nahin kaha ki ve tex nahin dena chaahate
 Everyone wants to give but is very upset with the process and the rate of taxes
 maine rajasthan ke kuch vyapaar sanghon ke pratinidhiyon se phone par baat kii
 The business of marble, handi craft and gold jewelery is very important in Rajasthan
 pehle donon par 28 fisadi jiesti lagi he or gold jewelri par 3 fisadi jiesti lagi he
 Sitaram Agarwal Saheb of Steel Association said that our business has been down by 40%
 tiamati saria, angel, panel in sab kii bikri bahut hi kam rah gai he
 In factories where three shifts were going on, there are two shifts
 over time karne vaale kii kamai kam ho gai kyonki over time band he yaa kam he
 Daily laborers are not getting work in every sector, this is the most affected
 vaise bhi bainkon ke en pi e main 39 fisadi hissaa steel sector kaa hi he
 In Rajasthan, the consumption of petrol and diesel has come down by six and a half percent
 ham sarkaar ko positive suzav dete hai, magar koi ection nahin hota
 The diagnosis of problems at the local level has stopped
 isi tarah hamane jaipur ke pattharon ko taraash kar fansy item banane vaale ek kaarobaari se baat hui
 On the condition of anonymity, he said that his business has fallen by 80 percent
 28 fisadi jiesti ke kaaran chizein itani mahangi ho gayi ki logon ne shaukia kareed band kar di
 The business of the first month was from fifty to six lakhs, which has now come down to ten to 15 lakhs
 iskaa asar rojgaar par padaa he
 They told that hamaari factory main jo mahange or sthaayee acountint the unako hataanaa padaa
 Many such people were trimmed and replaced with part time work
 teen teen kantrector the, harek ke paas 10 se 15 mazdoor kaam kar rahe the
 Sent two contractors back in the first month, now called
 magar ab kisi kantrector ke paas do se teen mazaduron se zyada kaa kaam nahin he yani har kisi ke 10 se 12 mazaduron se kaam chhin gaya he
 Let us not confine the problem of GST to the portal, due to which the business has fallen and the work done by the daily earners is not accounted for
 ek pranali or teen tex vaali jiesti ke aagaman kaa swaagat 15 agast 1947 kii madhyaraatri kii tarah kiya gaya, jiesti ke kaaran jinke pet par chot padi he, kya unhen bulaakar sansad main sammanit nahin karnaa chahie
 Last time in prime time when we were talking about bank strike, a voice was heard saying that jobs in banking sector have reduced
 aam taur par is saal tak bank bhartiyon ke liye ai bi pi es ko bataa detii he,institute aaf banking personal salection naam kii yah sanstha bank sevaaon main bhartiyon ke liye pariksha yojit karti he
 Let's look at the data found from the IBPS website
 2015 main 24, 604 clerkon kii bhartee kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha
 In 2016, an advertisement for the recruitment of 19,243 clerks came out
 ek saal main clerkon kii bhartee main 5,361 kii kami aa gai
 The recruitment of 7,883 clerks is vacant in 2017
 2016 se 17 ke bich 11,360 pad kam ho gaye
 Compared to 2015, 16,000 vacancies have decreased
 noujvaan aaj berojgaare ke registan main khadaa he or aapkaa netaa kabristaan kii baat kar rahaa he
 It cannot be said more clearly than this
 ab aate hai probationar afisar pio kii sankhya par
 The story here is also sad
 2015 main 12,434 post pio kaa niklaa tha
 In 2016, the direct 3612 was reduced to 8,822
 2017 main 3,562 pio kii hi vaikency nikali he
 That is, there are about 9000 less vacancies in 2017 as compared to 2015
 aaj ke hi indian express pradhanmantri kaushal vikaas yojana par ek report chhapi he
 You will also read the reports of Anchal Magazine and Anil Sasi
 skill deveopment mantralay zila str par maang or aapurti kii samiksha kar rahaa he, data jamaa kar rahaa he
 After seeing the data up to the first week of July 2017, the picture coming out is horrifying
 usee se pataa chalata he ki kyon media rojgaar kii baat nahin karata, kyon hindu muslim taapic kii baat karata he
 This report of Express has written comments abhi tak kaushal vikaas yojana ke tahat 30 lakh 67 hazaar logon ko prashikshan diya gaya he yaa diya ja rahaa tha
 Out of these only 2 lakh 90 thousand have got work
 12,000 karod kii is yojana ke tahat chaar saal main ek karod yuvaaon ko training dene kaa lakshya he
 Now it is being thought that the quality of training is not average
 par kya quality itani ausat thi ki 30 lakh main se teen lakh ko bhi rojgaar nahin mila to phir is yojana ke tahat thik kya tha
 Isn't this figure intimidating, would you still like to leave a worry about the future of the youth and see the debate on Hindu Muslim topics
 karnaa kya he, naujavaanon ko dangai bananaa he yaa naagarik bananaa he
 There is no reliable and transparent data system for employment in our country
 itani chizon ke ap banate hai, ek ap isi kaa ban jaataa jisase yahi pataa chalata ki is maheene centre ke kis vibhaag ne yaa rajya sarkaron ke kis vibhaag ne naukariyaan nikaali hai
 But governments will not tell because you will know the reality
 susheel mahapatra kii report dekhie, jiesti ke asar par kya kehete hai ricycling factory vaale
 The assumption is not correct that CA and tax lawyers are having fun for this reason, but the fact is that they are also very upset
 vyapaariyon kii pareshaani to or bhi badi he
 There was no habit of dealing with the bill and now they are worried about handling the bill
 jin vyapaariyon kaa set ap bada he yani jinke yahaan acountint vagairah kaa system he unhen kam pareshaani he lekin general store, medical store yaa kisi bhi retail bijness waalon ke liye jiesti ne saradard badha diya he

 Why your system is not ready according to the last date

 Many times the system does not accept when you migrate online by filling an offline form
 haalat yah he ki 250 client hai, magar teen chaar din lagane ke baad bhi 50% kii jiesti nahin bhari ja saki
 Merchants are raising the problem of refunds a lot
 kah rahe hai ki jab july kaa rifund 10 november ke baad milegaa to agast-sitambar or oktober kaa rifund to agle saal march ke baad milegaa
 Because of this, there is no money in the hands of traders

 rajasthan main marble, handi craft or gold jewelri kaa kaarobaar kaaphi ahm rakhata he
 The first has a GST of 28 per cent on both and 3 per cent GST on gold jewelery
 steel sangh ke seetaram agarwal sahab ne kaha ki hamaara bijness 40 percent down ho gaya he
 Sales of TMT bars, angles, panels have all been very low
 factriyon main jahaan teen shift chal rahi thi vahaan do shift chal rahi he
 The overtime earns less because the overtime is closed or less
 har sector main dihadi mazaduron ko kaam nahin mil rahaa he, sabase prabhavit yahi he
 As such, the steel sector accounts for 39 per cent of the banks' npas
 rajasthan main petrol or deazal kii khapat main saadhe chah fisadi kii kami aa gai he
 We give positive suggestions to the government, but there is no action
 sthaneey str par samasyaon kaa nidaan to band hi ho gaya he
 Similarly we talked to a businessman who made fancy items by carving stones from Jaipur
 naam na bataane kii shart par kaha ki unke bijness main 80 fisadi kii giravat ai he
 Due to 28 per cent GST, things became so expensive that people stopped buying amateur
 pehle maheene kaa bijness pachaas se saath lakh kaa hota tha jo ab ghatakar das se 15 lakh par aa gaya he
 This has impacted employment
 unhone bataaya ki Those who were expensive and permanent accountants in our factory had to be removed
 aise kai logon kii chantni kii or unki jagah part time kaam liya
 There were three contractors, each with 10 to 15 laborers working
 pehle maheene hi do kantrector ko waapas bhej diya, ab bulaayaa he
 But now no contractor has more than two to three laborers, ie 10 to 12 laborers have been lost
 ham jiesti kii samasya ko portal tak hi simit na rakhen, iske kaaran vyapaar jo manda padaa he or dihadi par kamaane waalon ke haath se jo kaam chhina he, uskaa koi hisaab nahin he
 The arrival of a system and a three-taxed GST was welcomed like the midnight of 15 August 1947, due to the GST, those who have suffered injuries on their stomachs should not be called and honored in Parliament
 pichhali baar prime time main jab ham bank hadtaal par baat kar rahe the to ek awaz sunai di ki banking sector main naukariyaan kam ho gai hai
 Normally till this year the bank informs IBPS for the recruitment, this institution called Institute of Banking Personal Selection conducts the examination for the recruitment in the bank services

 The recruitment of clerks decreased by 5,361 in one year

 Between 2016 and 17, 11,360 posts were reduced
 2015 kii tulana main saulah hazaar vaikency kam ho gai he
 The young man stands in the desert of unemployment today and your leader is talking about the graveyard
 isse saaf saaf or isse zyaada kuch nahin kah saktaa
 Now comes the number of Probationer Officer P

 yahaan bhi kahani dukhad he
 In 2015, there were 12,434 posts of pos
 2016 main sidhaa 3612 kam ho kar 8,822 ho gaya
 In 2017, only 3,562 PO vacancies have come out

 Today's Indian Express has published a report on Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana
 anchal magazine or anil sasi kii report aap bhi padhiyegaa
 The Ministry of Skill Development is reviewing demand and supply at the district level, collecting data
 july 2017 ke pehle hafte tak ke data ko dekhne ke baad jo tasviir saamne aa rahi he wo bhayaavah he
 The same shows why the media does not talk about employment, why Hindu talks about Muslim topics
 express kii is report main likhaa he kitippaniyan So far, under the skill development scheme, 30 lakh 67 thousand people have been trained or were being given
 inamen se maatr 2 lakh 90 hazaar ko hi kaam mila he
 There is a target of training one crore youth in four years under this scheme of 12,000 crores
 ab ye chintan ho rahaa he ki kahin training kii quality to ausat nahin he
 But was the quality so average that even out of 30 lakh three lakhs did not get employment, then what was right under this scheme? kya yah aankada daraane vaala nahin he, kya ab bhi aap naujavaanon ke bhavishya kii chintaa chhodkar hindu muslim taapic par bahes dekhnaa chahenge
 What to do, whether to riot the youth or to make them citizens
 hamaare desh main rojgaar ko lekar koi vishwasaneey or paardarshee data system nahin he
 App for so many things are made, an app would be made by it, which shows that this month which department of the center or which department of state governments have taken out jobs
 magar sarkarein nahin bataaengi kyonki aap hakeekat jaan jaaenge
 See the report of Sushil Mahapatra, what do the recycling factory say on the impact of GST
 jiesti ke aane ke baad se transport sector kii haalat or karaab ho gai he
 In July, the turnover had come down to 20 percent, in August it came to 50 percent
 sitambar main 60 fisadi tak pahunchaa he magar ab bhi 30-40 fisadi bijness down he
 There has not been a significant difference in the timing of the trucks' rounds as the octroi had moved everywhere except Maharashtra
 dilli mumbai root par zarur trek ke pahunchane ke samay main das ghante kii kami ai he
 There are several reasons for this
 abhi bhi badi sankhya main vyapaariyon kaa registration nahin hua he
 Without registration the transporter cannot pick up their cargo because it will be caught
 nayaa niyam aisa hi he
 Still, the goods of those who have not been registered are going from here to there
 kaise ho rahaa he
 It is happening that the transporters taking the risk for this are charging twice as much
 is vakt sarkaar checking karne kii sthiti main nahin he
 But a large number of transporters want only the registered merchants to pick up the goods, but the business of those who have registered has reduced by 40 to 50 percent
 unke paas se transporter ko order nahin mil rahaa he
 Therefore trucks in warehouses are standing in large numbers which is not a good sign for any business or economy
 bijness down hone kaa trakon par or asar padaa he
 For example, trucks from Delhi which have gone south due to freight, are stuck there
 kyonki vahaan kii factriyon main utpaadan down he, trakon ko maal nahin mil rahaa he
 Therefore, instead of returning, they have been stuck in the cities of the south for a week
 transporter ne bataaya ki kam se kam 1000 se lekar 2000 tak trek dilli ke vahaan atake honge
 This never happened in the Diwali season
 ye sirf trek kii baat he, agar aap isamen transport main istamaal hone vaali trailor,chote trek, tampo ko bhi shaamil karenge to tasviir kuch or nazar aegi
 We have written all these things on the basis of conversation so that we know what is happening on the ground
 kisi bhi vyapaaree ne nahin kaha ki ve tex nahin dena chaahate
 Everyone wants to give but is very upset with the process and the rate of taxes
 maine rajasthan ke kuch vyapaar sanghon ke pratinidhiyon se phone par baat kii
 The business of marble, handi craft and gold jewelery is very important in Rajasthan
 pehle donon par 28 fisadi jiesti lagi he or gold jewelri par 3 fisadi jiesti lagi he
 Sitaram Agarwal Saheb of Steel Association said that our business has been down by 40%
 tiamati saria, angel, panel in sab kii bikri bahut hi kam rah gai he
 In factories where three shifts were going on, there are two shifts
 over time karne vaale kii kamai kam ho gai kyonki over time band he yaa kam he
 Daily laborers are not getting work in every sector, this is the most affected
 vaise bhi bainkon ke en pi e main 39 fisadi hissaa steel sector kaa hi he
 In Rajasthan, the consumption of petrol and diesel has come down by six and a half percent
 ham sarkaar ko positive suzav dete hai, magar koi ection nahin hota
 The diagnosis of problems at the local level has stopped
 isi tarah hamane jaipur ke pattharon ko taraash kar fansy item banane vaale ek kaarobaari se baat hui
 On the condition of anonymity, he said that his business has fallen by 80 percent
 28 fisadi jiesti ke kaaran chizein itani mahangi ho gayi ki logon ne shaukia kareed band kar di
 The business of the first month was from fifty to six lakhs, which has now come down to ten to 15 lakhs
 iskaa asar rojgaar par padaa he
 They told that hamaari factory main jo mahange or sthaayee acountint the unako hataanaa padaa
 Many such people were trimmed and replaced with part time work
 teen teen kantrector the, harek ke paas 10 se 15 mazdoor kaam kar rahe the
 Sent two contractors back in the first month, now called
 magar ab kisi kantrector ke paas do se teen mazaduron se zyada kaa kaam nahin he yani har kisi ke 10 se 12 mazaduron se kaam chhin gaya he
 Let us not confine the problem of GST to the portal, due to which the business has fallen and the work done by the daily earners is not accounted for
 ek pranali or teen tex vaali jiesti ke aagaman kaa swaagat 15 agast 1947 kii madhyaraatri kii tarah kiya gaya, jiesti ke kaaran jinke pet par chot padi he, kya unhen bulaakar sansad main sammanit nahin karnaa chahie
 Last time in prime time when we were talking about bank strike, a voice was heard saying that jobs in banking sector have reduced
 aam taur par is saal tak bank bhartiyon ke liye ai bi pi es ko bataa detii he,institute aaf banking personal salection naam kii yah sanstha bank sevaaon main bhartiyon ke liye pariksha yojit karti he
 Let's look at the data found from the IBPS website
 2015 main 24, 604 clerkon kii bhartee kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha
 In 2016, an advertisement for the recruitment of 19,243 clerks came out
 ek saal main clerkon kii bhartee main 5,361 kii kami aa gai
 The recruitment of 7,883 clerks is vacant in 2017
 2016 se 17 ke bich 11,360 pad kam ho gaye
 Compared to 2015, 16,000 vacancies have decreased
 noujvaan aaj berojgaare ke registan main khadaa he or aapkaa netaa kabristaan kii baat kar rahaa he
 It cannot be said more clearly than this
 ab aate hai probationar afisar pio kii sankhya par
 The story here is also sad
 2015 main 12,434 post pio kaa niklaa tha
 In 2016, the direct 3612 was reduced to 8,822
 2017 main 3,562 pio kii hi vaikency nikali he
 That is, there are about 9000 less vacancies in 2017 as compared to 2015
 aaj ke hi indian express pradhanmantri kaushal vikaas yojana par ek report chhapi he
 You will also read the reports of Anchal Magazine and Anil Sasi
 skill deveopment mantralay zila str par maang or aapurti kii samiksha kar rahaa he, data jamaa kar rahaa he
 After seeing the data up to the first week of July 2017, the picture coming out is horrifying
 usee se pataa chalata he ki kyon media rojgaar kii baat nahin karata, kyon hindu muslim taapic kii baat karata he
 This report of Express has written comments abhi tak kaushal vikaas yojana ke tahat 30 lakh 67 hazaar logon ko prashikshan diya gaya he yaa diya ja rahaa tha
 Out of these only 2 lakh 90 thousand have got work
 12,000 karod kii is yojana ke tahat chaar saal main ek karod yuvaaon ko training dene kaa lakshya he
 Now it is being thought that the quality of training is not average
 par kya quality itani ausat thi ki 30 lakh main se teen lakh ko bhi rojgaar nahin mila to phir is yojana ke tahat thik kya tha
 Isn't this figure intimidating, would you still like to leave a worry about the future of the youth and see the debate on Hindu Muslim topics
 karnaa kya he, naujavaanon ko dangai bananaa he yaa naagarik bananaa he
 There is no reliable and transparent data system for employment in our country
 itani chizon ke ap banate hai, ek ap isi kaa ban jaataa jisase yahi pataa chalata ki is maheene centre ke kis vibhaag ne yaa rajya sarkaron ke kis vibhaag ne naukariyaan nikaali hai
 But governments will not tell because you will know the reality

 See the report of Sushil Mahapatra, what do the recycling factory say on the impact of GST
 isi tarah hamane jaipur ke pattharon ko taraash kar fansy item banane vaale ek kaarobaari se baat hui
 On the condition of anonymity, he said that his business has fallen by 80 percent
 28 fisadi jiesti ke kaaran chizein itani mahangi ho gayi ki logon ne shaukia kareed band kar di
 The business of the first month was from fifty to six lakhs, which has now come down to ten to 15 lakhs
 iskaa asar rojgaar par padaa he
 They told that hamaari factory main jo mahange or sthaayee acountint the unako hataanaa padaa
 Many such people were trimmed and replaced with part time work
 teen teen kantrector the, harek ke paas 10 se 15 mazdoor kaam kar rahe the
 Sent two contractors back in the first month, now called
 magar ab kisi kantrector ke paas do se teen mazaduron se zyada kaa kaam nahin he yani har kisi ke 10 se 12 mazaduron se kaam chhin gaya he
 Let us not confine the problem of GST to the portal, due to which the business has fallen and the work done by the daily earners is not accounted for
 ek pranali or teen tex vaali jiesti ke aagaman kaa swaagat 15 agast 1947 kii madhyaraatri kii tarah kiya gaya, jiesti ke kaaran jinke pet par chot padi he, kya unhen bulaakar sansad main sammanit nahin karnaa chahie

 Let's look at the data found from the IBPS website
 2015 main 24, 604 clerkon kii bhartee kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha
 In 2016, an advertisement for the recruitment of 19,243 clerks came out
 ek saal main clerkon kii bhartee main 5,361 kii kami aa gai
 The recruitment of 7,883 clerks is vacant in 2017
 2016 se 17 ke bich 11,360 pad kam ho gaye
 Compared to 2015, 16,000 vacancies have decreased
 noujvaan aaj berojgaare ke registan main khadaa he or aapkaa netaa kabristaan kii baat kar rahaa he
 It cannot be said more clearly than this
 ab aate hai probationar afisar pio kii sankhya par
 The story here is also sad
 2015 main 12,434 post pio kaa niklaa tha
 In 2016, the direct 3612 was reduced to 8,822
 2017 main 3,562 pio kii hi vaikency nikali he
 That is, there are about 9000 less vacancies in 2017 as compared to 2015

 Out of these only 2 lakh 90 thousand have got work
 12,000 karod kii is yojana ke tahat chaar saal main ek karod yuvaaon ko training dene kaa lakshya he
 Now it is being thought that the quality of training is not average
 par kya quality itani ausat thi ki 30 lakh main se teen lakh ko bhi rojgaar nahin mila to phir is yojana ke tahat thik kya tha
 Isn't this figure intimidating, would you still like to leave a worry about the future of the youth and see the debate on Hindu Muslim topics
 karnaa kya he, naujavaanon ko dangai bananaa he yaa naagarik bananaa he
 There is no reliable and transparent data system for employment in our country
 itani chizon ke ap banate hai, ek ap isi kaa ban jaataa jisase yahi pataa chalata ki is maheene centre ke kis vibhaag ne yaa rajya sarkaron ke kis vibhaag ne naukariyaan nikaali hai

 But now no contractor has more than two to three laborers, ie 10 to 12 laborers have been lost

 a strategy to replicate his first miracle is in progress
 magar, kya ye misaal kaayam rah paaegi
 Will the Aam Aadmi Party once again repeat its victory? Will Kejriwal prove to be the biggest superman in Delhi's politics? To know the answer to these questions one has to walk in a little flash back
 silsilaa jahaan se shuru hua
 
 
 26 November 2012
 yahi wo taarikh he, jab rashtrabhakti or aam aadmi kii zindagi behatar banane ke junun ke saath shuru hua tha aam aadmi party kaa safar
 To fight against the corruption of every day, from the road to government offices, the people are fighting every day to save the country that is being held in the chains of corruption
 lokapal ke dam parapure desh ko bhrashtachar ke jaal se mukt karaane kaa sapana
 So this journey started from here
 janalokapal andolan se lekar aam aadmi party tak or pehle chunaav se lekar dilli kii satta hasil karne tak
 This political journey is like a dream come true
 magar, ye sapana kai baar tuutate-tuutate bachaa, to kai myanon main bikharane bhi laga
 Every aspect of the party that has started a new kind of politics in the politics of the whole country, including Delhi, is quite interesting
 foundation de yani sthapana diwas ke maukey par aam aadmi party kii buniyaad se lekar bulandi tak pahunchane kii puri kahani aapako bataate hai
 Anna's Arjun, Kejriwal Airwind Kejriwal and Anna Hazare
 ek purv beurocret to doosraa shashakt andolankaaree
 One Dronacharya and the other his Arjuna
 donon ne milakar ek aise mudde ko raajnneetik hathiyaar banaaya, jiske nishane par desh kii tamaam partiyaan thim
 The fight against corruption is the foundation of the Aam Aadmi Party
 magar, kisi ko nahin maaloom tha ki andolan kii parinti siyaasi party ke rup main saamne aegi or anna wike singh (jo ab endie sarkaar main mantri hai) or santosh bhartiya ko saath lekar kejariwal se alag ho jaaenge
 The foundation of the Aam Aadmi Party had started getting ready on the same day when their entire team including Anna and Kejriwal started the movement at Jantar Mantar in August 2011
 india against karpshan, yani bhrashtachar ke kilaaf bharat ke logon kii ladaai
 With this movement, celebrities of their respective fields like Kejriwal, Kiran Bedi, Prashant Bhushan, Shanti Bhushan came to the stage with Anna
 anna sirf andolan ke samarthak the
 Hunger strike is his greatest strength, so from the beginning he was trying to get his demands only on the basis of the movement
 (aage ke pannon par padhein, raajnneeti main aane ke liye kejariwal ne kya tark diya tha
 ) 'how will cleaning happen without going to the mud'? The movement started from Jantar Mantar to the Ramlila Maidan in Delhi
 tatkaaleen upie sarkaar se janalokapal kanoon banane ke mudde par kai baar takaraav hua
 The UPA government made many promises at that time, but each time Anna and his colleagues felt that the people were being cheated
 khud bijepi or narendra modi is andolan ke saath the
 However, the Jan Lokpal bill was not passed, but the foundation for the separation of Kejriwal and Anna was laid
 ek tark tha ki raajnneeti ke keechad main nahin janaa he
 But the counter argument was that how would cleaning happen without getting into the mud
 phir digvijay singh sareekhe netaaon kii 'raajnneeti main aakar dikhaao' jaisi chunauti bhi thi
 Therefore Kejriwal took a bold decision
 soshal netwarking site samet prachaar ke tamaam aadhunik sadhano ke dam par unhone ek masterplan taiyaar kiya
 About a year after the Jan Lokpal movement started, in October 2012, Kejriwal started a hunger strike for Jan Lokpal in place of Anna
 tatkaaleen upie sarkaar ne kejariwal ke anshan kii parvaah nahin kii
 Kejriwal said that only by being part of the political system can the public be given their rights
 janalokapal bill agar laana he, to uske liye siyaasi party banani hogi
 Anna was totally against it
 kejariwal ke saamne dilli ke ramlila maidan main hazaron log baithe the
 He had to take the decision to split from Anna and form a party
 2 oktober 2012 ko kejariwal ne anshan vaale manch se hi party banane kaa elaan kar diya
 The date for formation of the party was fixed, 26 November
 kyonki, yahi vah din tha, jab 1949 main samvidhan ko apanaaya gaya tha
 Finally separated Anna On 26 November 2012, the paths of Anna and Kejriwal separated forever
 anna india against karpshan ke dam par apni jang jari rakhane kii raah par chal pade
 The same India Against Corruption whose Facebook page also took a sharp turn on the level of views and openly posts content in favor of BJP and against AAP
 khayr, kejariwal ne party banaai or satta sangharsh ke maidan main kud pade
 He sought name suggestions for the party through social media from all means of publicity
 dilli waalon ne kejariwal kii topi par aam aadmi dekhakar naam diya, aam aadmi party
 Everyone liked this name and on 26 November 2012 a new party was formed
 aam aadmi party
 Arvind Kejriwal became the face
 ab kejariwal ke saamne kai chunautiyaan thim
 To prove his existence in the Delhi Assembly elections to be held after one year
 
 And before that winning the hearts of the people of Delhi
 ye donon hi chizein aasaan nahin thim
 This was the first election of Aam Aadmi Party and Kejriwal
 2012 main party bani or 2013 main dilli ke chunavi sangram main party apni jagah banane ke liye sangharsh kar rahi thi
 All parties, including Congress, BJP, tried to dismiss Kejriwal's politics early
 virdohi dalon ne ye kahana shuru kar diya ki ek hi chunaav main aam aadmi party or unke netaaon ko raajnneeti kii mushkilon kaa andaaza ho jayega
 
 party pehle hi chunaav ke baad khatm ho jaaegi
 (read on the following pages: that historic day of election results) and that day of 8 December 2013
 
 
 kejariwal or unke raajnneetik saathiyon ke liye 2013 kaa dilli vidhansabha chunaav agnipariksha kii tarah tha
 The party decided to contest all the 70 seats in Delhi
 magar, isi bich kejariwal ne ek or bada faisla kar liya
 He declared to contest from New Delhi seat
 is seat par dilli kii tatkaaleen mukhyamantri or 15 saal se lagaataar kaabiz rahane vaali shila dikshit lard rahi thim
 People felt that Kejriwal had made a big political mistake
 magar, wo apane faisale par adig rahe or shila sarkaar ke dauraan tamaam tarah ke karpshan ke aaropon ko siyaasi prachaar kaa hissaa banaate rahe
 When the election results came, the politics of Delhi completely changed
 mukhyamantri shila dikshit ko kejariwal ne nai dilli seat se buree tarah haraaya or sattarudh rahi congress 8 siton ke saath tisare paaydaan par pahunch gai
 The 15-year Congress rule was ended by the new fledgling party
 congress ko jitna bhi nuksaan hua, sab aam aadmi party kii vajah se tha
 Congress leaders moved to the third position in most seats
 congress ko karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa or bijepi bhi bahumat se chaar siten peeche rah gai
 The promise of creating a corruption-free Delhi with cheap electricity and free water worked
 aam aadmi party ko 28 siten milin
 Never before has this happened in the political history of Delhi
 sirf ek saal puraani party ko pehle hi chunaav main 28 siten kabhi nahin milin
 External support and controversy of the Congress It was a time of celebration for Kejriwal and his colleagues
 kyonki, sabase badi party hone ke baavjood bijepi ne sarkaar banane se inkaar kar diya or congress kisi bhi surat main sarkaar nahin bana sakati thi
 To stop the BJP, the Congress wrote a letter to the Lieutenant Governor, that if the Aam Aadmi Party forms the government, then the Congress is ready to support it unconditionally
 'shashan kaa anubhav na hone kii vajah se aam aadmi party sarkaar banane se dar rahi he', aise kuch bayaan aae
 The AAP decided to form the government
 kejariwal ne vidhansabha main har party ke vidhayak ko vishwaas prastaav kaa samarthan karne kii apil kii
 The BJP was not to side, but the eight Congress mlas and the only JDU MLA voted in favor of the AAP and the government got a majority
 jo log kejariwal ko kaarij kar rahe the, wo unhen ramlila maidan menshapath lete hue dekhte rah gaye
 On 28 December 2013, Kejriwal formed the government with the support of the Congress
 dilli ke mukhyamantri kii kursi par rahete hue kejariwal ne sasti bijli or muft pani kaa vaada nibhaayaa
 Advised the sting operation to get people free from corruption, started helplines and promised immediate action on every complaint
 gaiyr-paaramparik raajnneetik style main kuch tej-tarraar faisle kiye
 After this, the Aam Aadmi Party decided to pass the Jan Lokpal bill
 ye wo mudda he, jise lekar kejariwal ne andolan se satta tak kaa safar tay kiya tha
 On 14 February 2014, Kejriwal said in the assembly that he would resign if the Lokpal bill was not allowed to be discussed
 kejariwal ne chodi kursiaisa hi hua
 Neither Congress nor BJP supported Janlokpal Bill
 apana vaada puraa na kar paane kii vajah se kejariwal ne satta main bane rahanaa uchit nahin samajha
 Amidst the uproar, Kejriwal announced his resignation as per the decision
 unhone bijepi or congress ko hi iske liye zimmedaar tehraaya
 However, opponents said that he ran away from the CM to fulfill his dream of becoming PM directly
 kejariwal ko aaj bhi is mudde par safai deni padati he
 After leaving power, Kejriwal also contested the Lok Sabha election from Varanasi against Narendra Modi
 magar, haar gaye
 The Aam Aadmi Party did not get the expected success in the Lok Sabha elections, but they did get four mps from Punjab
 AAP ek baar phir dilli kii siyasat main sakriy ho gaye
 Maharashtra and Haryana elections were also not contested, so that they were confined to Delhi
 haalanki, party ke gathan se lekar ab tak kai log unase alag ho chuke hai
 Several prominent faces of the party, including Shazia Ilmi, have turned away from Kejriwal one by one
 jo log dur hue, unamem se kaiyon kii nazdikiyaan baad ke dinon main bijepi se badi hai
 Now once again Kejriwal has announced to contest from New Delhi
 dilli vidhansabha chunaav ke baad loksabhaa chunaav main mili badi haar ke baad rajdhani kii siyasat main aam aadmi party kii vaapasi kii raah utani aasaan nahin he, jitani pehle thi
 There has been a lot of change in the political air here in a year
 ab kejariwal ko pehle se badi agnipariksha deni hogi
 Yoga Guru Baba Ramdev was held at Heathrow Airport by British Customs officials for about eight hours for questioning
 aath ghante tak bithaae rakhane ke baad bhartiya samay ke mutabik der raat ek baje baba ramdev ko chhod diya gaya
 Troubled, angry Baba came out of the airport, there was a clear face and resentment over the tongue
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe aath ghante yahaan kya ashtaang yoga karavaaya gaya
 i do not even have a lump
 ek dollar, ek rupaya bhi nahin
 i do not keep it with me
 note book le lee jisamen lectures ke nots banaata hum
 No reason was given for stopping

 According to Indian time, at 5 pm Baba Ramdev was on his way out of the airport with his colleagues, when the immigration people came and stopped him
 imigration vibhaag ne baba ramdev se sari jaankaree maangi or raat 9 baje unhen jane ko kah diya gaya
 But then suddenly they were stopped
 kuch dastavejon ko lekar unase phir poochtacha hone lagi

 aap is maamle main jald se jald dakhal den
 Sources who had reached the Visitor Visa said that Baba Ramdev had come here on Visitor Visa instead of Business Visa, so he was questioned by the Customs officials
 media main ai kuch khabaron main yah bhi bataaya gaya he ki ramdev se kuch un dawaaon ke bare main poocha gaya jinhen vah apane saath yahaan laae hai
 His spokesman SK Tejarawala called these reports baseless saying that he was questioned for bringing some medicines
 tejaarvaala ne bataaya, ‘yah spasht nahin he ki yoga guru ko kisalie roak kar rakhaa gaya
 He carried nothing but his personal belongings with him
 yah to british prashasan hi bataa saktaa he ki unhen kyon roka gaya
 'hindi-sanskrit books were the reason? Baba Ramdev has come here to participate in a function

 Students said that after the results of the IIT JEE Advanced exam were declared, Anand Kumar announced that 26 of the 30 children studying here had passed the exam, including Onorit Goswami, Suraj Kumar, Yash Kumar and Suryakant
 Whereas the reality is that many of these 26 students have never been a part of Super-30
 ab aap bhi le sakate hai Super-30 main daakhila, badale ye niyamgagan naam ke chaatr kaa aarope he ki suraj kumaar jisane iaiti jeii advance pariksha paas kii he, usne rajasthan ke kota ke ek koching santhaan se padhai kii he magar jab IIT-JEE pariksha ke nattejey ghoshit kiye to anand kumaar ne suraj kumaar ko super-30 kaa chaatr bataate hue media ke saamne pesh kiya

 Gagan said that of the 26 children who Anand Kumar declared successful in the IIT JEE examination this year, only Onorit Goswami was a student of Super-30

 The fee to enroll in this coaching institute was about Rs 33040

 kendriya grih rajyamantri kiran rigiju ne desh main badhati ashishnutaa jaise arapon ko sire se khaarij kiya he
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, he said that intolerance has not increased in the country, but the Congress has become intolerant
 unhone kaha ki asal main congress party kisi or dal ko kendriya satta main dekh nahin paa rahi he
 Responding to the audience question, Rijiju said that discrimination against women in temples and dargahs is wrong
 dharmaguruon ko is ore charchaa kerani chahie
 Both men and women have been given equal status in the constitution, while talking about Arvind Kejriwal, the Union Minister said that the Chief Minister of Delhi himself has said that he is chaotic, he does not believe in the constitution and it is not right to face him
 
 sawaal: dalit hatyakand yaa dadri jaise maamlo main rajaneta pahunchate hai, lekin pathankot main shaheedon ke ghar koi nahin jaataa?rigiju: pathankot vaali ghatana kaa agar congress or aam aadmi party jaise raajnneetik dal saath dete hai to unako vot nahin miltaa he
 The politics of caste has bedeviled India
 congress or communist vaale log ise chhodana nahin chaahate hai
 There should not be discrimination in the name of any caste or religion in the country
 lekin jab usamen raajnneetik rang de diya jaataa he to vishay hi badal jaataa he
 Congress should answer what it has done for Dalits so far
 sawaal: beete kuch varshon main desh ke shikshan sansthaanon main naksalwadi gatividhiyaan bad rahi hai, uske liye grih mantralay kya kar rahi he?rigiju: shikshan santhaan echaradi mantralay ke tahat aate hai
 Education is a state subject
 jaise apatitiai kaa maamla he, vahaan centre sarkaar ko chairman niyukt karne kaa adhikaar he
 Now when this is done, political color is given that you cannot do it
 raajnneeti rang dete hi mudda badal jaataa he
 Students were also protesting there, but please tell if the principal will be appointed at the behest of the students
 sawaal: kya bharat ashishnu he?rigiju: bilkul nahin
 The country has been made intolerant by Congressmen
 congress ne itnaa lanbaa shashan kiya ki vah duusare kisi ko satta main dekhnaa sahan hi nahin kar sakate
 The country gave us a majority
 congress ko yah samajhnaa chahie, lekin vah to pehle din se ashishnu he
 Question: But what about the filmstars that are saying? Rijiju: It is motorized
 main kisi kaa naam nahin le rahaa
 But if someone makes a statement to someone, it is not going to change the mind of the country
 aamir khan ke alaava yaa shahrukh khan ke alaava bhi bahut se logon ne kaha he ki desh main koyeeshishnutaanhin he
 Question: What blueprint does the government have on women's security? Rijiju: This is a very serious matter
 iske do pahalu hai
 What action is a government taking, and what do we think at the social level
 agar mahila ghar main hi surakshit nahin he to aap isko kya kahenge
 Women are being raped inside the house
 police kii karrwai to jaruri he, lekin saamaajik str par ghatnaon ko rokane ke liye kaam jaruri he
 There is a need to spread awareness in this direction
 pichley saal se registration of krime against vuman main badhotaree hui he
 We have ensured that if there is an incident against women, it has to be filed and action is to be taken
 sawaal: nirbhaya centres or isko lekar fund ke bare main kya kahana chahenge?rigiju: awarenes ko lekar hamane bahut sa kaam kiya he
 We are going to start Nirbhaya Fund on a very large scale
 chaahe rajya sarkaar ke str par kaam karnaa ho, ham puraa sahyog kar rahe hai
 Look at the Delhi Police, training, awareness programs are being conducted for women
 haa, abhi is ore bahut kuch karne kii jarurat he or ham kar rahe hai
 Question: What would you like to say on discrimination against women in temples and dargahs? Rijiju: Our country runs with the Constitution
 samvidhan main mahila or purush ko baraabar kaa darja he
 Some temples and religious places that have built their system, now we have not gone everywhere and checked behind the system
 ham yahi kehete hai ki bhedbhaav nahin karnaa chahie
 i am sitting on a constitutional post and would like to say the same
 dharmaguruon ke bich main bhi yah charchaa honi chahie ki mahilaon ko lekar bhedbhaav na ho
 Question: What is the guarantee that an incident like the Nirbhaya massacre will not happen again? Rijiju: We will guarantee that there will be no reduction in our commitments
 sawaal: logon ke man main dar he, dilli police raajnneeti main uljhi he
 Security tightens when Republic Day comes? Rijiju: It is not just about the Delhi Police
 yah samaaj ke har jagah awarenes kii baat he
 It is not that only VIP security matters to us
 suraksha kaa prabandh pehle jaise karte the, aaj ke samay main vah badal gaya he
 The manner of functioning of the police has also changed
 sirf police par sabakuch chhodane se kaam nahin chalegaa
 Now is the age of internet and mobile
 nai tarah kii chunautiyaan hai
 Question: How will Kejriwal's insistence on Delhi Police handle it? Rijiju: Don't ask me more questions about Kejriwal
 vah padhaa-likhaa aadmi he
 When i met him, he was very nice to meet
 vyavhaar bhi acha karte hai, lekin baahar jaakar tivi main jo bolne lag jate hai, bhaashanbaaji karte hai to lagata he ki are ye galat baat kaise kar sakate hai
 There are innocent spears to see
 vah khud kah chuke hai ki vah arajak hai, kanoon ko nahin maanate hai
 Do not follow the constitution
 vah khud hi kah chuke hai, unke munh laganaa thik nahin he
 We respect them, but they should also hold the dignity of their office
 vah apane hi afasar ko gaali dete hai
 If he cannot run the government, then he names the Prime Minister
 jabaki piem modi dinaraat kaam main lage rahete hai
 It is a privilege of the country that the country has got such a Prime Minister
 lekin unako kamjor karne ke liye arvind jaise log duniyabar kii baat karte hai
 Question: On hoisting the tricolor, crowds are fierce in many places in the country after teaching the National Anthem
 iske liye sarkaar kya kar rahi he?rigiju: ham grih mantralay main baithe hai to hamaare paas har subah hajaaron report aati hai ki yahaan yah hua, vahaan vah hua
 We cannot take action everywhere
 jo bade mudde hai, rashtriya suraksha he ham use dekhte hai
 For small incidents, the local agency which is the local state takes action and we take the report
 sawaal: aatankwaad hi nahin hinsa bhi samasya he, subramanyam swami ram mandir kaa mudda uthaate hai to kya isse danga nahin bhadkegaa?rigiju: itane bade mulk main bolne kii aazaadee honi chahie
 If someone is saying something, then how can we stop it? lekin saamaanya tareeke se kanoon ke daayre main rakhkar apni ichha jaahir karne kaa har kisi ko haq he
 As far as the Ram temple is concerned, a case is going on in the court regarding this

 The comments unhone kaha ki is tarah kaa bayaan dekar sena pramukh kya khud ko raajnneeti main shaamil nahin kar rahe hai? jo ki samvidhan ke khilaaf he
 He said that by making such a statement, are the army chiefs not involving themselves in politics? Which is against the constitution

 bhartiya antariksh agency isro ne chandrayan-2 mishan ke kathinaaiyon ke bare main bataaya he
 It tells that after launching the Indian scientist Chandrayaan-2, what kind of problems are going to be faced till it lands on the moon
 haalanki, vaigyanikon ne bharosa jataayaa he ki ve in sari chunautiyon ko puraa kar lenge
 Chandrayaan-2 will be launched from July 9 to 16
 saat tarah kii chunautiyaan aaengi saamne chandrayan-2 ke safar mempahali chunauteeh sateek raste par le janalaunch ke samay dharti se chand kii duuri kareeb 3 lakh 84 hajaar 400 kimi hogi
 To choose the most appropriate trajectory for such a long journey
 kyonki sahi tregectory se chandrayan-2 ko dharti, chand or raste main aane vaali anya vastuon kii gravity, saura vikiran or chand ke ghoomane kii gati kaa kam asar padegaa
 The second challenge: radio signals will arrive late due to the greater distance from communication in deep space
 deree se jawaab milegaa
 At the same time, noises in space will also interfere with communication
 teesri chunauteeh chand kii kaksha main pahunchanaachandrayan-2 ko chand kii kaksha main pahunchaana aasaan nahin hoga
 Because of the constantly changing orbital movement, Chandrayaan-2 will require extreme accuracy to orbit the moon
 isamen kaaphi eendhan kharch hoga
 Landing will be possible at the right place only when it reaches the right orbit
 chauthi chunauteeh chand kii kaksha main ghoomanachandrayan-2 ke liye chand ke chaaron taraf chakkar lagaana bhi aasaan nahin hoga
 The big reason for this is that the gravity around the moon is not equal
 isse chandrayan-2 ke electronics par asar padataa he
 Therefore, the gravity and atmosphere of the moon must also be closely calculated
 paanchavin chunauteeh chandramaa par soft landingisro vaigyanikon ke mutabik chandramaa par chandrayan-2 ko rover or lander kii soft landing sabase badi chunauti he
 Propulsion systems and onboard computers will be the main task to comfortably land the rover and lander at the South Pole from the Moon's orbit
 ye sabhi kaam automaticali hongi
 Sixth Challenge: There are many pits, stones and dust on the lunar surface of the Moon
 jaise hi lander chand kii sataha par apana propalshan system on karegaa, vahaan teji se dhul udegi
 Dust can blow up and accumulate on the solar panel of the lander, thereby disrupting the power supply
 onboard computer ke sensors par asar pad saktaa he
 Seventh Challenge: One day or night of changing temperature is equal to 14 days of the Earth
 isaki vajah se chand kii sataha par taapmaana teji se badalata he
 This will hamper the work of Lander and Rover

 Making a mockery of the laptop scheme of the SP government of UP at the Congress rally in Aligarh, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi said that there is a computer government here in UP
 computer chalata nahin he
 There is no electricity
 magar ham dilli main adhikaar kii sarkaar chalaate hai
 He also targeted Akhilesh Yadav for not implementing the upa's Right to Food Bill in UP and said that people should pressurize the government for this
 unhone apane bhaashan main haalia mujffar nagar dangon kaa zikr kiya, lekin bijepi kaa naam lene se bache
 Mentioned Bhatta Parsaul and said that the farmers of Aligarh will benefit the most from the land acquisition bill in the country
 magar is daawey kii koi vajah nahin bataai rahul gandhi ne
 He referred to the popular schemes of the Congress and told the youth that UP you have to change
 congress ko badalanaa hoga
 It is worth noting that Rahul Gandhi, who attacked Mayawati yesterday, pulled SP today
 padhie kya kaha congress upaadhyaksh ne‘jab koi dilli main jameen lenaa chahta he
 So he gets the market rate
 magar jab aapse jameen lee jaati thi to sarkari order lagata tha or saste rate par jameen le lee jaati thi
 i promised you that the Congress will fight this battle and show it by winning
 samay laga, magar ham aapaki ladaai lade or ham bill laae or use paas karke dikhaaya
 Opposition people stood up
 pehle use standing cameti main le gaye
 Got dizzy, tried to stop
 parliament main le gaye ham or use paas kiya
 i want to tell you that the farmer in Aligarh will not benefit as much as anyone in the country
 doosraa kaam kiya hamane
 See, we run a government of rights
 ab ham bhojan kaa adhikaar laae hai
 In India, we are going to give food for one rupee
 yahaan dekho koi majdoor he
 They must have thought that every day i do wages
 or inke dimag main ye sawaal uthta he ki bhaiya kal mujhe bhojan milegaa yaa nahin
 Will my children get food tomorrow or not
 main aapako bataanaa chahta hum ki sirf kal nahin, har roj aapako milegaa
 This will be guaranteed by the Congress
 or upi main kya ho rahaa he
 Listen, i want to tell you
 upi main sarkaar ne kya kaha
 Every family will get 35 kg of food grains in India
 puure desh main
 But UP will not get till 2014 elections
 kyonki upi kii sarkaar kah rahi he ki agar hamane congress party kaa bhojan kaa adhikaar yahaan lagu kar diya
 So we will be beaten in the election that we will not understand
 to main kahana chaah rahaa hum ki aap dabaav daalo
 The poor people of the village of UP should get food grains for 1 rupee
 ye ladaai aapaki he, congress kii he
 Like you fought in Bhatta Parsol, fought in Parliament
 to bataao, ladoge aap, jor se bolo
 what is your name
 ye congress party ne uttar pradesh ko badalanaa he, to aapako karnaa hoga
 These young people are standing
 ye sapa-basapa se nahin hone vaala he
 i want to tell you that when the Congress Party is in government
 2004 main jo hamane kaha
 Done in 2009
 2014 main karne vaale hai
 We will form a government for the common man, the weak, the poor, women
 ham jo adhikaar kii baat karte hai, bhojan kaa, rojgaar kaa, shiksha kaa adhikaar dete hai
 The last thing i want to say
 mujffar nagar main danga hua
 Did the common man benefit from the riots, the public
 log mare
 When people were dying
 hindu bhi mare
 Muslims also died
 sahi baat he
 No one asked in that
 vahaan main gaya
 Talked to Hindu
 musalmaan se baat kii
 Both spoke one thing
 dekhie hamaare bich dushmani nahin he
 These political people did and ruined us here
 ladaai bhaiya karai jaati he
 It is done for political gain
 aam aadmi ladanaa nahin chahta he
 The common man wants to live with love, wants to work
 hindustan ko aage badhanaa chahta he
 There are political powers here who know that if a fight does not take place, they cannot win
 vah acchhee tarah jaanate hai, isile ye ladaai karwaanaa chaahate hai
 Whether this is right or not inako main bataanaa chahta hum ki hindustan kaa itihaas he ki ham sab ek khadey rahete hai
 Hindus should be Muslims
 sikh ho
 These are the ones who fight
 ham inako nahin karne denge
 This is the history of the Congress party
 hamaare paas har ek vyakti baraabar he
 We do not say give this thing to any one caste
 ham kehete hai ki agar hindustani he to use bhojan kaa adhikaar milegaa
 UP is going backwards, so it is leaving
 sun lo
 Because you are being divided
 jab tak aap log ek nahin hoge
 As long as you do not talk about Uttar Pradesh, then this state will not progress further
 ye kaam congress party karegi
 We will work for you uttar pradesh kii sarkaar banaaenge or aapke liye ladenge
 You have summer time
 aap dur dur se aae
 Thanks a lot
 jai hind’ Film Review: Koilanchalaktar: Vinod Khanna, Sunil Shetty, Vipinno, Rupali Krishnaravadirector: Ashu Trikhaduration: 2 hr 48 min Star: 1 in 5 1 was a famous coal mafia of Bihar
 suraj dev singh
 It is said that the former Prime Minister living in Ballia and known as the President in the political society, was a close friend of Chandrasekhar
 khaas baat yah he ki baaki netaaon kii tarah chandrashekhar suraj dev se apni is yaari ko chhipate nahin the
 Right now this person is mentioned because the film that i have come to see today seems to be influenced by him
 kaise ek shaks sarkaar ke kol mining ke rashtriyakaran ke prayaason ko dhata bataate hue apni samanaantar sarkaar chalaata he
 How at his behest, Bahubali distributes the coins of honor in his mint with the iron of awe
 or kaise saal dar saal, dashak dar dashak ye sab chalata rahata he
 And then a mistake, which initially looks small
 us shaks ko usee koyale main mila detii he
 But this plot sounds as good as listening
 film utani hi ghaatak he
 It gets blurred with the focus of focusing on many characters
 aatank dikhaane ke pher main bhaddi or shor se bhari ho jaati he
 If i say in a sentence, raita spreads and spreads so that it does not shrink
 or is chakkar main film lambii bhi ho jaati he
 There is a coal mafia in Jharkhand
 naam he sarayu bhaan singh
 The government takes up the coal contract, but the writ runs in Rajapur area
 jo koi union ke naam par sir uthaane kii koshish karata he, use sarayu kaa khoonkhaar bahubali karua berahami se or saarvajanik rup se kuchal detaa he
 Saryu clearly says that whatever comes his way in coalfields, it will become coal
 magar uske raste main aata he ek eemaandaar iees afasar
 Nishith Kumar nishith ko shuruaati daur main munh kii khaani padati he
 And when he has to screw on the head
 uskaa apana parivaar musiibat main pad jaataa he
 Now on one side there is a police-administration ready to do everything and on the other hand the owner of Karua means coal mafia
 is hadabong main naksali, nautanki, veshya or vidrohi tevar vaali kavitaayen sab kuch hai
 But everyone was taken aback
 film main vinod khanna sarayu ke kendriya kirdaar hai
 But the expected brutality on his face is rarely seen
 nishith ke role main sunil shetty ko arase baad parde par dekhnaa shuru main acha lagata he
 But a person with an action hero like him did not come to the screen to play unfit
 karua ke role main vipinno ko bhi acha footage mila he
 But he could not play every shade of his role
 rupali krishnarav ke role ke bajaay diarector ne unke blouse ko tang karne par zyada mehnat kii
 But it does not look glamorous but slut
 koyala mafia par anuraag kashyap kii film gangs of vasepur ne ek tikhaa coment kiya tha
 Clearly, the bar had risen very high
 ye film uske aas-paas bhi nahin thaharti
 Director Ashu Trikha seems to be a little rude and in control at some places
 train union netaa koyala mazdooron ko faij ahamed faij kii krantikari kavita sunaae
 Then a rebel like Karua who always appears only in jeans to show his six pack, narrate that poem to his daughter
 ye sab kuch bahut nakli lagata he
 In the film, for the tempering of reality, it has been shown to show real shots of Launda dance and coal mines
 par aashu film par apni pakad tabhi kho dete hai, jab us anchal kii hindi kii tone nahin pakad pate
 If you like drama, romance and action-packed story unfamiliar b grade films, then go for it
 madhya pradesh kii bhopal loksabhaa seat ko lekar charchaa kaa bazaar garm he
 From Kareena Kapoor to Bollywood's domineering Salman Khan, the name is being tossed to contest from here
 lekin ab bhartiya janata party ke diggaj netaa rahe or rajya ke purv mukhyamantri babulal gaur kaa naam bhi res main he
 Congress leader Digvijay Singh has met Babulal Gaur
 madhya pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri kaa kahana he ki digvijay singh ne unase mulaakaat kii thi or bhopal se loksabhaa chunaav ladane kaa ofer diya tha
 Babulal Gaur said that i have asked him to consider it
 bataa den ki babulal gaur isse pehle bhi kai baar party ke khilaaf bayaan dete rahe hai or congress netaaon kii tarif karte rahe hai
 In such a situation, Digvijay Singh and his meeting have once again intensified the speculation
 Senior BJP leader and former Madhya Pradesh CM Babulal Gaur on reports of Digvijay Singh offering him to join Congress: He visited me and offered me to contest polls from Bhopal Lok Sabha seat on Congress ticket
 i told him i will think about it

 However, later many Congress workers also put up posters in support of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in Bhopal
 congress samarthakon ne bhopal main poster laga apil kii he ki priyanka gandhi ko bhopal loksabhaa seat se congress kaa ummidavaar banaae jaae
 Let us tell you that in the recent assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, BJP did not give ticket to Babulal Gaur, he has been the Chief Minister of the state and has also won the assembly elections many times
 jiske baad kaha ja rahaa tha ki vah party se naaraaz hai

 kathua main bacchee ke saath gangrape se aahat gautam gambhir ne samaaj se poocha yah tikhaa sawaal
 
 
 
 dilli ke akshardham road par dardanaak haadasa hua,jahaan car main aag lagane se do maasoom bacchiyon or unki maa kii maut ho gai
 While a child and her father narrowly escaped the fire
 bataaya ja rahaa he kii shaam takreeban saadhe 6 baje ek car akshardham mandir ja rahi thi,jaise hi akshardham road par pahunche tabhi car main peeche vaale hisse main aag lag gai
 Three small girls and parents were riding in the car
 aag itani teji se lagi ki car ke peeche vaale seat par baithi maa ranjana (35) or paanch or dedh saal kii bacchee baahar hi nahin nikal paae
 As soon as the fire started, Upendra, who was driving the car, immediately took out the girl sitting in front, but the three sitting behind were burnt in the fire
 pita upendra ne bataaya kii wo wo kalka ji ghoomane ke baad apane parivaar ke saath akshardham mandir ja rahe the tabhi road par car main aag lag gai thi
 DCP (east Delhi) Jasmeet Singh said that the two girls who lost their lives in this accident are two years and five years old
 police ne bataaya ki car main aag lagane kii soochna shaam kareeb saadhe chah baje mili thi
 The DCP said that during the investigation it was found that Upendra was driving the car and he managed to get out of the vehicle with one of his daughters sitting next to him on the front seat
 haalanki, pichhali seat par baithi uski patni or do betiyaan baahar nahin aa sakin
 He said that the possible cause of the fire appears to be a CNG kit
 dilli waalon ko bin mausam barsaat se thodi raahat to mili jarur he
 But this relief can also become a disaster
 ji haa is barish se jagah jagah bhare pani ke gaddhen machharon ko panpane ke liye puri tarah jimmedaar ho sakate hai
 These mosquitoes breed easily in clean or stagnant water and these mosquitoes become the cause of dengue, chikungunya and malaria
 in bimariyon se bachane ke liye zaruri he ki pani ko kahin ikaitha na hone den
 According to doctors, this year, according to Saikal, malaria is more likely
 malaria ke machhar tehre pani me hi panpate hai
 Therefore, do not allow the water to be collected anywhere by forgetting it
 iske alaava ye machhar ekadam subah or der shaam ko hi katate hai ,jabaki dengue kaa machhar din main katata he
 Apart from this, the Malaria also comes with a sharp body pen
 doctorisalah ke bina koi dawaai na len, aspirin yaa disprin kaa seven haragiz na karen
 If you have more fever, just trust paracetamol
 is tarah ke kisi bhi lakshan par turant blad test karawaaye ore phir aage kii davaaiyaan len
 So therefore mosquitoes are more likely to flourish in this season, it would be better if we just try to defend ourselves

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, reshuffling the Union Cabinet, removed seven ministers and included v Kishore Chand Dev and seven other new faces
 iske alaava teen anya mantriyon kaa darja badha diya gaya

 benny prasad verma ko kendriya ispaat mantri banaaya gaya
 Earlier, he was looking after the same ministry as the Minister of State with independent charge
 is pherbadal ke dauraan manmohan singh ke dimag main kahin na kahin is agle varsh hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav jarur rahe honge visheshkar uttar pradesh ke chunaav
 That is why people like Beni Prasad Verma and Rajiv Shukla have been given a place in the cabinet
 vahiin is pherbadal main rahul gandhi kii bhi khub chali or unki pasand ke yuva netaaon jitendra singh, milind devda ko bhi jagah di gai he
