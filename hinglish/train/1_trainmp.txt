 What bomb was placed in the flight airline KGL 9268 of the Russian airline Metrojet flew from Sharmal Sheikh International Airport in Egypt to St
 Peterburg, Russia, with 224 passengers? Or was the plane shot down by a ground-to-air anti-aircraft gun? These questions are arising because initial investigation of the aircraft's black box has revealed that the accident has not been caused by any technical fault

 But then the question is, how did this become possible despite such tight security? If there is a conspiracy like planting a bomb behind the accident, then it is necessary for the investigating agencies to find out who was the one who placed the bomb in the plane?

 While acquitting all the accused in the 2G scam, the CBI court's special court remarked as you have heard in the Bollywood film Jolly LLB
 is film ke jaj sunderlaal treepathi (saurabh shukla) ne saboot nahin pesh hone ko lekar jis tarah kii pidaa jaahir kii thi, thik usee tarah kii pidaa 2G ghotaale kii sunwaayee karne vaale jaj ne kii
 The only difference is that the judge of the Jolly LLB sentenced the accused on the evidence, but the court did not get the evidence and the accused were not punished
 aap khud hi pard lijie ki aakhir court ne faisla sunaate samay kya tippanee kii

 The judge said that all were going on with public perception, which was fabricated only by rumors, gossip and speculation
 unhone kaha ki adaalat kii kaarywahi main Public Perception koi ahmiyat nahin rakhti he
 The judge said that the prosecution initially showed great enthusiasm in the case, but as the case progressed, it became difficult to understand what the prosecution ultimately wanted to prove
 itnaa hi nahin, jab cese or aage badha, to abhiyojan dishaheen or shakki ban gaya
 In the last phase of the trial, no senior officer from the prosecution was even ready to sign the answers
 isse bhi ahm baat yah he ki special public prosicuter us dastavej par hastakshar karne ko taiyaar nahin hue, jisko unhone khud court main daakhil kiya
 In such a situation, what should the court do without such a signature? No officer was willing to take responsibility for the investigation
 kai adhikariyon ne filon par itani kharaab hand riting main nots likhe ki unako padhaa or samajha nahin ja saktaa tha
 Its purpose was to complicate the matter
 filmajoli elelbi ke jaj sunderlaal treepathi kii tippanee''is court main baitha har shaks jaanata he ki accident rahul dewan (rajeev siddhant) ne kiya he, lekin isse koi fark nahin padataa ki koun kya sochataa he? mujhe jajment dena hota he, avidence ke aadhaar par

 The Kerala government has told the Supreme Court that the state police conducted a 'thorough investigation' into the case of a Hindu woman accepting Islam and then marrying a Muslim man and found nothing that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) investigated )

 unhone kaha ki nitish kumaar ko mudde ko samajhane main kaaphi vakt lagata he or agar wo ab notebandi ko sabase bada ghotaalaa ghoshit kar den to isamen koi hairaani nahin hogi
 Let me tell you that in the 64th quarterly review meeting organized by the Bankers Committee, Nitish Kumar said that some banks did not play their role properly during the demonetisation, due to which the money of the general public reached from where
 unhone kaha ki garibon se paisa vasuul liya jaataa he, lekin taqatvar logon kaa kya jo rin lekar gaayab ho jate hai? unhone kaha kibainkon kii bhoomikaake kaaran notebandi kaa laabh logon ko jitna milanaa chahie tha, utana nahin mil paaya

 Film Name: Detective Byomkesh Bakhshidirector: Dibakar Banerjee Star Cast: Sushant Singh Rajput, Anand Tiwari, Swastika Mukherjee, Neeraj Kabi, Meyang Chang, Divya Menon Duration: 150
 54 minutesrtificate:u / aretimga:3 stardiarector dibaakar banerjee kaa naam aate hi yaad aati he 'khosla kaa ghosla'
 Miss films like 'oye Lucky Lucky Oy', 'love Sex Aur Cheat' and 'shanghai'
 har film ek duusare kii alag
 Separated from each other and now Dibakar has tried to bring life to the character 'byomkesh Bakshi' from the stories of Bengali writer Sharadendu Bandyopadhyay
 byomakesh ke sathmurder mistry ko sulajhaneki koshish main dibaakar ne 1942 ke kalakatta ko parde par jeevant kiya he
 Suspense also gets interesting as the story progresses in good Hindi films based on murder mystery
 ant tak ham anumaan lagaate rahete hai ki kahin katl radha ke chachaa ji ne to nahin kiya he? vaise, aisa hi kuch rahasy dibaakar ne apni is taaja film main bhi banaae rakhaa he
 In the end, the end of the film reaches us like a surprise
 film kii kahanenovember 1942 main kalakatta ke vidya sadan college main padhane vaale byomakesh bakshi (sushant singh rajput) se ek sahpaathee ajit bandyopadhyaay (anand tiwari) apane ek jaanane vaale ke achaanak gaayab hone kii baat karata he
 Byomkesh makes up his mind to find her and the quest turns into a murder mystery
 rahasy kaa hal nikaalane ke liye byomakesh aasapaas ke logon kii madad letaa he
 In the film, Byomkesh is brought up with different characters like Angoori Devi (swastika Mukherjee), Dr
 anukool guha (niraj kabi) se padataa he
 But is this murder story a murder mystery? Does Byomkesh help Ajit? To answer this and all such questions, you have to go to the cinema hall
 dibaakar banerjee kii is film main do film puranesushantsingh rajput hai, jinhone apane kirdaar ko nibhaane ke saath-saath nirantarata banaae rakhane main dakshata hasil kii he
 At the same time, Anand Tiwari as his friend has acted according to the demands of the film and the story
 bengal kii mashhoor abhinetri swastika mukherjee ne anguri devi ke rup main har ek frem ko jagamaaya he
 She reminds one moment of Helen from the film 'the Train'
 pehle hi frem main unki entry swim suut main hoti he or film main apane kirdaar ko swastika ne bakhubi siddh kiya he
 Dr
 anukool guha ke rup main abhinayta niraj kabi ne kaaphi prabhavit kiya he
 Neeraj has been seen in the most outstanding form due to the dialogue and performance
 is film ke pehle bhi niraj ne Ship Of Theseus main behtareen acting kaa mujaharaa pesh kiya tha
 Divya Menon and Mayang Chang have also left no stone unturned to play their respective characters
 dibaakar kii ye kahani thodi lambii he or kahin-kahin jarurat se zyada khinchi hui lagati he
 This film of about two and a half hours could have been a bit shorter
 film main japan ke kalakatta par kiye ja rahe hamale jaisi ghatana ko dibaakar bas chhukar nikal gaye hai
 Apparently all his attention is focused on solving the murder mystery
 yani film main aapako zyada se zyada vakt byomakesh ke saath bitaane kaa mauka milegaa
 Dibakar's close portrayal of the 1942 Calcutta in the film deserves praise

 It is worth noting that for the last few days there has been a heavy fire in the forests of Bageshwar, Bhimtal in Kumaon
 jangalon main vikaraal hoti aag ko dekhte hue mukhya van sangrakshak ne khud kaman sanbhali he
 The Conservator of Forests who visited Kumaon said that the authorities are fully alert and the situation is under control
 aag par niyantran paane ke liye van vibhaag ke sabhi adhikariyon, karmchaariyon kii chuttee par bhi roak laga di gai he
 In view of the continuous fire in the forests, a parliamentary meeting will be held in Almora this week, which will also include MP Bhagat Singh Kosari
 chardhaam yatra par sankatjangalon main lagi aag devbhumi ke 8 jilon main aag bhadak gai he or chardhaam yatra par bhi iskaa khatra mandaraane laga he

 Asarboris Johnson will do on his own terms if the Conservative Party gets a majority In the 650-seat parliament in Brexitbriten, the Conservative Party has crossed the 326-seat mark needed for a majority
 kanjarvative party ko bahumat milane se britain european union (EU) se baahar nikalne yani bregsit kii raah par badhata dikh rahaa he
 Exit polls predict a bitter defeat of the Labor Party
 kanjarvative party ko 368 or lebar party ko 191 siton ke milane kaa anumaan he
 However, the action to be taken out of the European Union and the future of the country will be determined through this election
 pradhanmantri boris johnsonbraczitsamarthak hai or vah britain ko europea union se alag karnaa chaahate hai
 Britain now wants to break away from the European Union
 is mudde par britain kii sansad or janata do hisson main bant gai he
 The European Parliament has also been unable to take a decision on Brexit
 lihaaja yah samajhnaa jaruri he ki bracit aakhir he kya or is maamle main kya uthal-puthal rahi he
 What is Brexit? Brexit ie UK + Exit
 bracit kaa sidhaa sa arth he britain kaa european union se baahar janaa
 The whole world is confused about whether Britain will stay in the EU now
 boris johnson kii party ko mil rahe rujhaanon se jaahir ho rahaa he ki vah britain ko european union se alag kar denge
 Why the demand for Brexit arose that it started in 2008 when Britain's economy was in the grip of collapse
 desh main mahangaai bad gai thi, berogari bad gai thi, jiskaa samaadhaan nikaalane or arthvyavastha ko thik karne ke prayaas chal rahe the
 Meanwhile, during the elections in 2015, the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) raised the issue that the European Union was doing nothing to ease Britain's economic slowdown
 unka kahana tha ki isaki vajah se hi britain kii sthiti lagaataar kharaab ho rahi he
 During that time, considering the economic slowdown as the reason, the reason was given that Britain has to pay $ 9 billion for the European Union budget every year
 isaki vajah se britain main bina roak-tok ke log basate hai
 The UK is suffering huge losses from the free visa policy
 bracit kaa virodh bhi huaavahin, isse ulat britain ke kai log europea union se ho rahe phaaydon ke bare main jaanate hai or bracit ke faisle ko galat bataate hai
 People who oppose Brexit argue that this will have a negative impact on business from other European countries
 britain kaa single market system khatm ho jayega or britain kii jidipi ko baari nuksaan hoga
 pmteresa Mayboris Johnson, who became David Cameron, made Brexit his point and took over as Prime Minister on condition of its implementation
 lekin inamen se terresa me bracit par bahumat hasil nahin kar pain or unhen istipha dena padaa
 a 2016 referendum was held in Britain, with the majority favoring Britain's separation from the European Union
 bracit par janamat sangrah ke rujhaan ke baad tatkaaleen camran sarkaar ko istipha dena padaa tha
 Then the Conservative Party formed a government led by Teresa May
 lekin bracit ke liye vah aavashyak samarthan nahin juta sakin or apane pad se istipha de diya tha
 After this Boris Johnson was sworn in as Prime Minister
 apni sharton par uthaaenge kadambaharhaal, agar aakhri nattejey bhi agsit pole kii tarah aaen to pradhanmantri boris johnson apni sharton par europea sangh se alag honge
 Britain's Home Minister Preeti Patel has said that the new government will take swift steps to implement Brexit

 The story of Shayera Sona Shin, why she took up the education of children? Shayara Sona Shin did aajtak
 in se hui vishesh baatcheet main bataaya ki ve 2016 main apni maa ke saath rajasthan ghoomane ai thim
 Shaira went to Pushkar there
 dakshin or dakshin-purvi asia par international deveopment studies kii padhai kar rahi shaayara ne vahaan nat samudaay ke do chote ladakon ko dekha ki ve sadak par bheekh maang rahe hai
 Shaira was sad to see the condition of those children
 iske baad ve un bacchon ke saath unke ghar gayi
 Where these children lived there were only slums
 vah bhi behad buree haalat main
 There was no water facility
 na hi khaane kii
 Everything is temporary
 bal vivaah ke khatre sun 17 saal kii ladki ne shaadi se kiya inkarinaki haalat dekh kar shaayara se rahaa nahin gaya
 She decided that she would improve the lives of these children
 us samay to ve pushkar se chali gayi
 But a month later Pushkar returned from Amsterdam (the capital of Holland)
 taaki yah pataa kar saken ki ve un bacchon ke liye kya kar sakati hai? pushkar main rahane ke dauraan shaayara ko pataa chalaa ki nat samudaay ke log bheekh maang kar guzaara karte hai
 Leave their children, even their parents never went to school
 sab dhol bajaakar sadakon par kartab dikhaakar paise kamaate hai
 Girls growing up, 51% decline in child marriage sacrifices
 Then Shaira decided that she would work for the education of these children
 iske baad shaayara 2016 se lekar ab tak holland se 16 baar pushkar ain
 Shayara discovered 40 children from the Nati community of Chungi Chowk and Badi Basti area
 iske baad shaayara ne sthaneey jawahar public skool ke prabandhan se baat kii
 So that these children can study in this school
 skool ke principal giriraaj gujariya ne bataaya ki ek 11-12 saal kii bacchee ek maheene se skool nahin aa rahi he
 Her siblings are also not coming with her
 pataa karne par jaankaree mili ki us bacchee ke saath-saath 4-5 or bacchiyon kii shaadi 16 se 18 oktober ke bich ajmer se aage enech-89 ke paas nasirabad main shaadi hone vaali he
 Giriraj, the hero of Abhinandan, will teach in Rajasthan schools, told this to Shayra
 iske baad shaayara ne ajmer or pushkar main maujuud bacchon ke liye kaam karne vaali sthaneey sansthaaon ko bolaa
 Then the marriage was stopped with the help of police
 shaayara ne bataaya ki ve yah sochakar dar gai thim ki itani kam umr main shaadi karne kaa baad un bacchiyon kaa kya hoga? kyonki nat samudaay main 14 saal kii umr me shaadi ho jaati he or 24 saal tak kii umr tak ladkiyaan 4-5 bacchon kaa maa ban jaati hai
 Shaera herself raises the expenses of school, food and clothes for these children of the nut community

 Motivates these children to go to school
 iske alaava shaayara kii vajah se 4 se 14 saal ke bacchon ke extra tution claces chalati hai
 Also, school teachers give tuition to children above 14 years of age so that they can continue studying
 or bhavishya main open board akzam dekar shiksha jari rakh saken
 Giriraj told that Shaira has run the Blue House Project for these children
 taaki un bacchon kaa jivan sudhar sake
 The teachers and staff of my school take care that the education of those children is not disturbed
 shaayara abhi aane vaali hai iske baad ham sab milakar un bacchiyon ke pariwaron se milenge
 Will ask them to teach girls

 shaayara kii maa aadhi bhartiya or aadhi dach hai

 Posted by Arun jaitleyonfriday, February 12, 2016 i admire his government, i read his interview in India Today
 khaastaur par unki chintaa ki pradhanmantri or sarkaar vipaksh se raay bina liye hi kaam kar rahi
 He feels that the government's efforts for the economy are insufficient
 mujhe puraa bharosa he ki manmohan agar maujuuda sarkaar kaa nishpaksh vishleshan karen to unhen lagegaa ki bharat main aisi sarkaar he, jahaan piem ke shabd antim faisla hote hai
 Where natural resources are allocated by a transparent process
 bina bhrashtachar ke
 Where industrialists do not make the rounds of North Block to get their files enlarged
 jahaan envyrnment clearence atakaey nahin
 Is there any difference in the government's work culture aimed at the UPA? During the UPA government, public sector banks could hardly run even from their boards or North Block
 ve chalate the 24, akbar road (congress mukhyalay) se
 UPA did not see the challenges in power and infrastructure
 unase ham ab nipat rahe hai
 Many infrastructure projects stuck are now moving forward

 Seeing the condition of the government, it seems that there is a lack of confidence in it
 piem modi ko samajhnaa chahie ki vah puure bharat desh ke piem hai
 The entire nation was eyeing Mumbai since Friday morning as superstarsalman Khanki was to be heard on bail in the Bombay High Court
 isi bich dilli se apni raajnneeti chalaane vaale congress upaadhyaksharahul gandhiek aise maamle main pesh hone ke liye mumbai pahunchate hai, jisamen unhen pesh hone ke liye supreme court ne ek din pehle hi chhot de di thi
 Questions were bound to arise and also whether this was the publicity stint of the Congress vice-president? Publicity stunt is being said that the entire nation was eyeing Mumbai, so Rahul Gandhi appeared in court despite being exempted so that he also discussed the Salman case
 And get publicity
 kyonki unhone buudhvaar ko ye saaf taur par dekha ki kis tarah puraa desh kii media saaf taur par seshan court or salmaan khan ke ird gird hi mandara rahaa tha
 After appearing in court, Salman's style, Rahul Gandhi said, "I will fulfill whatever commitments i make
" lagata he ki rahul gandhi ko salmaan kaa wo mashhoor dialog yaad aa gaya hoga- ek baar jo maine kamitment kar di, uske baad to main khud kii bhi nahin sunata
 Aggressive Andarrahul Gandhi has been seen in an absolutely aggressive avatar, inside and outside Parliament ever since he returned from abroad after a holiday of almost two months
 or ho saktaa he ki unka ye mumbai rukh isi andaaj kii ek kahani ho
 The compulsion to shine the image has become necessary for Salman to improve his image after the hit and run case and black deer hunting case, perhaps in the same way Rahul is also trying to brighten his political image
 kisaanon ke liye padayatra or raily karne ke baad rahul ne loar court main pesh hone ke baad yah sabit karne kii koshish kii ki wo kanoon kaa kitna sammaan karte hai
 Entry on Twitter: Gandhi recently made an entry on Twitter
 shaayad unhen samaj main aa gaya he ki soshal media ke bina wo desh ke yuvaaon tak apni sidhi pahunch nahin bana sakate
 Shiv Sena said on Tuesday that Lord Ram is not bigger than the law for Prime Minister Narendra Modi (PM Modi)
 aisa isliye kyonki piem modi ne ek saakshaatkaar main kaha tha ki unki sarkaar ram mandir nirmaan (ram Mandir Issue) ke liye kisi adhyadesh par nirnay nyaayik prakriya samaapt hone ke baad hi karegi
 Please tell that Shiv Sena has demanded to bring an ordinance to pave the way for construction of temple in Ayodhya
 usne daleel di he ki maamla dashakon se adaalaton main chal rahaa he
 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut tweeted, "the Supreme Court has said that Ram temple is not an immediate (trial) case
" piem modi (PM Modi) ne bhi kuch alag nahin kaha
 i congratulate him for clarifying his stand on the matter
 pradhanmantri (PM Modi) kehete hai ki ram mandir ke liye koi adhyadesh nahin laaenge
 Its constitutional meaning is that Lord Rama is not older than the law
 ullekhneey he ki vibhinn televijan channelon dwaara prasaarit ek saakshaatkaar main piem modi se ayodhya main ram mandir ke liye adhyadesh laane ke vibhinn hindutv samoohon kii maang ke bare main sawaal kiya gaya
 In response to this question, PM Modi said that let the judicial process come to an end
 nyaayik prakriya samaapt hone par ek sarkaar ke taur par jo bhi hamaari jimmedaari hogi, ham sabhi prayaas karne ko taiyaar hai
 Be aware that the Shiv Sena has tightened its stand on the Ram temple issue
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne gat maheene maharashtra ke sholapur jile main ek raily main bhaajapa ke sahyogi dalon se ram mandir mudde par apana rukh spasht karne ke liye kaha tha
 Significantly, just before the Dharma Sansad to demand the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had said that the central government has full authority to construct Ram temple this time
 agar vah aisa nahin karti he to main aapako daawey ke saath kah saktaa hum ki yah sarkaar dobaaraa nahin banegi
 But Ram temple will definitely be built
 unhone kaha tha ki jab main ramalala ke darshan karne ja rahaa tha to mere man main vichaar aayaa ki main ramalala ke darshan karne ja rahaa hum yaa koi jail ja rahaa hum
 Attacking the central government, Thackeray had said that not once in the last four years did the government try to construct a Ram temple
 ab jab chunaav najadik he to vah hinduon kii bhaawanaaon se khel rahi he
 He also remembered former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee during this time
 uddhav ne kaha tha ki atal ji ne kaha tha ki hindu maat nahin khayega
 i believe that Atal ji had a mixed government at that time, so even though he could not do anything for the Ram temple, but now there is an absolute majority government at the center
 uddhav thaakar ne kaha tha ki mainen suna tha ki siem yogi ji ne kaha ki mandir tha, he or rahegaa
 This is our perception, our feeling
 dukh is baat kaa he ki wo dikh nahin rahaa
 When will that temple be seen? jald se jald uskaa nirmaan hona chahie

 Both are couples with a nature attached to the ground, far away from the shaking
 lekin filmon kii pasand ke maamle main ek-duusare se bilkul ulat
 While Aamir's films rock the box office, Kiran Rao pays more attention to the artistic aspect
 bollywood main donon ke bich is tarah kii khinchataan bahut rochak he
 Aamir wants Kiran to work in a romantic relationship film, while Kiran wants to bring less popular films to the public's attention
 donon ne senior editor gayatri jayraman se apane bete aaazaad se lekar saamaajik-rajnatik soch vaale filmkaaron kii jarurat tak har vishay par khulkar baat kii
 Both of you have become directors of films, with films on Dhobi Ghat and Taare Zameen
 aap donon main behatar filmkaar koun he?kiran ravfamir
 He is more adept in this art
 mere mukaable ve apni baat kehane main kaaphi had tak safal rahe hai
 My film was very experimental in my eyes
 ab main dekhati hum ki use main kuch alag tarah se kaise bana sakati thi
 Aamir Khan: When i made Taare Zameen Par, i had almost 20 years of experience working in films, while Dhobi Ghat was Kiran's first film
 main nahin samajhataa ki main pehali baar main hi dhobi ghat jaisi behtareen film bana paata
 In this way, Kiran has started much better than me
 inke saath ek acchhee baat yah he ki ye khud ek lekhika bhi hai, jo main nahin hum
 When she portrays the characters, i am filled with pride
 aamir kaa nirdesan karke kya unke bare main aapaki raay badali?kirantapahali baar nirdesan karte hue inke jaise sakasham kalakaar kaa saath karnaa khushkismati kii baat he
 i had also chosen artists who were either completely new, or non-professional
 aamir ke saath kaam karnaa bahut khushi kii baat thi
 They are deeply immersed in their role and do not come out of the role until its completion
 jha jab aapane pehali baar ek filmkaar team ke taur par shuruyaat kii to kya aaj ke mukaable aap par bahut zyada dabaav or ummiden thim?aamiramain dabaav se bilkul prabhavit nahin hota
 i don't know what people expect from me
 yah baat mere kaam ko bilkul prabhavit nahin karti
 Kiran: It is not like pressure, but a thrilling smoke
 aamir aap karodon ru
 Let's make movies
 kiran, aap kalatmak filmein banaati hai
 Is there any conflict between the two of you in terms of making films? Aamir: There is diversity in my choice
 kiranuameri pasand waisi bahurangi nahin he
 Aamir: But there was no difference between us while working together
 main patakatha ke anusaar chalata hum, uski jaisi jarurat hoti he, aap usee tarah se kaam karte hai
 Aamir, everyone knows that you ignore the award
 kiran, aap kah chuki hai ki award milane se film ko kuch had tak phayda miltaa he
 Do you both have a conflict of opinion about this? Kiran: i certainly believe that when a film wins the Best Foreign Language Oscar or the Golden Bear (berlin Film Festival) Award, that film benefits
 aamiramain apni jindagi main award ko bahut hi kam ahmiyat detaa hum
 How can you choose one film as better than another? i do not think that artistic works can be assessed in this way
 main kiran kii is baat se sahamat hum ki kuchhek puraskaron se aapkaa bazaar badhata he
 But the award is not proof that my film is better
 aajkal 100 karod ru
 How do you decide whether a film is good or not in the era of films earning? Aamir: In terms of business, i look at the earnings of the first week and then the weeks after that
 masalan, 3 idiyats ne pehle hafte main 40 karod ru
 Earned
 bharat main isane kul 202 karod ru
 Did business
 is tarah 40 karod ru
 Five weeks' earnings of Rs 200 crore per week
 hoti he
 In other words, the film did five times the business of the first week
 yah is baat kaa ek acha sanket he ki logon ne film ko pasand kiya he
 But 3 Idiots if Rs 100 crore in the first week
 kii kamai kii hoti or uske baad uskaa kul kaarobaar 200 karod ru
 If it were for me, it would have meant that people have rejected the film
 yah baat main mukhya dhara kii filmon ke bare main kah rahaa hum
 Kiran, how do you do the kind of films you want to do business? Kiran: i liked the ship of theses and i helped distribute it across India
 hamane paanch shaharon main ise 20 cinemagharon se shuru kiya
 Later it increased to 80 theaters
 apane prachaar abhiyaan main hamane logon se kaha ki ve is film ko unke shahar main relies karne ke liye vot karen
 It received a strong response on social media and elsewhere
 kisi film ke liye yahi asli pyaar he
 Aamir: We are living in a time where things can be bought
 agar koi film kaamyaab nahin rahi he to bhi main aapako or janata ko yah vishwaas dilava saktaa hum ki nahin, vah to kaamyaab hui he
 How much have you influenced each other's way of living and thinking? Kiran: Amir has helped break some of my earlier assumptions and inspired me to see the world from a normal perspective
 aamiramain samajhta hum ki kiran ne mujhe sahaj banane main madad kii he or pehle se zyada khush rahanaa sikhaaya he
 In the film industry, both of you are known to live a life connected with land
 aapke liye yah saamaanya jivan kitna myne rakhata he?kiraniumain mahasoos karti hum ki ek badi hasti ke saath shaadi hone se meraa rutaba bahut bada ho gaya he
 Despite this, i feel that the basic aspect of my life has not changed much
 ham jitani tadak-bhadak vaali jindagi ji sakate the, use dekhte hue hamaari jindagi kaaphi saamaanya he
 i can comfortably go out and do the grocery shopping myself
 aamiralpani sthitiyon ko dekhte hue ham sukun se ji rahe hai
 Is there a greater need for normal life as a parent? Kiran: i try to keep Azad away from the press
 vah nahin jaanata ki aamir koun hai
 He is just a father
 usne papa kii koi film nahin dekhi he
 He has been on the sets of the film many times and according to him they are all normal
 vah yahi sochna hoga ki sabhi papa log shooting karte honge
 Aamir: i remember Junaid and Ira
 rina or main is baat ko lekar hameshaa sachet rahete the ki bachche apane kandhon par kisi tarah kaa billaa lagaakar na bade hon
 i think we have been successful in that
 kiraniumain chaahati hum ki aaazaad ke saath bhi aisa hi ho
 Kiran, has being a mother changed anything in the way you make movies? Kiran: Life has a meaning in the kind of films i want to make
 maa hone se kuch had tak aap usee disha main chalane kaa ehsaas pate hai
 Seeing shows like Satyamev Jayate, you seem to have some concern about the state of the country
 ek filmkaar ke taur par saamaajik-rajnatik najariya kitna jaruri he?aamiramujhe nishchit rup se saamaajik-rajnatik mudde pareshaan karte hai
 For the last three years, i have started feeling that way since i started doing research for Satyamev Jayate
 yah shaayad meri filmon main nahin dikhaai detaa he, kyonki unki kahani main nahin likhata hum
 But the idea of making Satyamev Jayate was mine
 hamaare desh main rajnatik filmein zyada nahin likhi jaati hai
 Not that i have not done any such film
 sarfarosh kaaphi had tak ek rajnatik film thi
 Kiran: Peepli (live) was a similar film
 aamiriarang de basanti ko bhi rajnatik film kaha ja saktaa he
 i have done three films like this
 teen kam nahin hotin yaar
 Kiran: We don't run after him to make a political film
 aamirasiyaasi hi kyon, kisi bhi tarah kii film ke peeche nahin bhaagate
 In this way nothing happens that well, now i am going to make a political film or whether it is on child care or education
 yah meraa kaam kaa tarika nahin he
 i naturally want things to happen
 agar mujhe koi kahani acchhee lagati he to main us par kaam karata hum
 In the second phase of Satyamev Jayate, are you changing its direction or thinking on a new perspective? Aamir: We have taken new and important issues
 ham ise or dhardaar bananaa chaahate hai
 This time we are trying to tell the solution to the problems as well
 kya aap yuva filmkaaron or nai filmon ke prati kisi tarah kii jimmedaari mahasoos karte hai?aamiropehle main apane hi kaam main khoyaa tha
 But in the last few years i have started thinking about this
 isiilie hamane pipli (live) or jane tu
 
 yaa jane naa banaai
 We thought that we should choose storytellers, directors and stories and give new talent a chance
 kiranthalgan ko chhodkar hamane har film nae nirdeshak ke saath kii he
 Aamir: i am thinking many more things about this, which i also discuss with Kiran
 mumkin he, main apni har film ke liye do intern-ek ladkaa or ek ladki-rakhun
 This will give us the benefit of new thinking and on the other hand i will be able to give the benefit of my experiences to them also
 bataur filmkaar aage ke bare main kya sochate hai?kiranavistaar kaa mere liye koi khaas arth nahin he
 i would like to make more films, big or small
 saath hi dusron ko filmein banane main madad karun
 Aamir: Being bigger than my thought does not mean getting better
 main chahta hum ki main jo kar rahaa hum, usamen or gaharaai tak jaaun
 i want to enjoy my work even more and do better films than before
 main jaanata hum ki kuch log kai kaam kar sakate hai

 so, maine tay kiya ki arthshaastra kii jagah main international relations ko mukhya vishay banaaungaa
 i applied to JNU and got admission in the School of International Relations (SIR)
 maine vahaan do saal gujaarey
 Those two years were very unique years of my life
 us dauraan maine duniya ke bare main bahut kuch janaa-samajha
 My development there was more than the three years i spent at St
 Stephens
 jeenyu kaa anubhav romaanchakaari tha
 It was the post-emergency period
 campus main raajnneeti ko lekar baari gahamagahami or vividh tark-vitark hua karte the
 Many students were also arrested from JNU
 campus main behad jeevant or urja se bharpoor maahaul hua karata tha
 There were students with leftist ideology, extreme leftist and extreme leftist ideology
 hostel main khub bahes or charchaaen hua karti thim, jo raat ke khaane ke baad shuru hoti thim or subah tak jari rahati
 i remember that i participated in many such debates and learned a lot
 vishvavidhyalay main alag-alag vichaardhaara vaale kai achche vaktaa aayaa karte the
 There were also many active groups of independent thinkers on campus who were fully aware but were not politically committed to the left ideology
 main unheen swatantra vichaarkon kii toli main tha
 SFI had deep roots in the campus
 mujhe yaad he ki prakaash karaat, seetaram yechuri or jayras banerjee chunaavon ke dauraan aate the or ucch str kii bauddhik charchaa hoti thi
 Issues of ideology, global and national politics were central to these debates
 isiilie to jeenyu main seekhney kaa anubhav bahut vyapak or vividhta se bharaa rahaa
 Within the university, the academic circle was quite vibrant
 kuch shikshak to asaadhaaran the
 Among the distinguished teachers in the School of International Studies was Ashok Guha, a professor who taught me economics
 professor anand jaise shikshak bhi the jinhone antarrashtriya kanoon padhaayaa
 Professor S
 di
 Muni and Dr
 pushpesh pant bhi the
 a full bouquet of outstanding teachers was present who helped the students in learning and development
 padhai kii gunvattta bahut ucch thi
 JNU was then on the old campus
 kakshaon ke baad, ham librari jaaya karte the
 Beside the library, there was a dhaba where we used to spend a lot of time in debates and discussions
 main periyar hostel main rahata tha
 No one could remain untouched by the intellectual atmosphere there
 kala, samskruti, nrity or sangeet ke prati meri samvedansheeltaa jeenyu main hi viksit hui
 JNU was, in many ways, a small India
 vahaan desh ke har hisse ke chaatr the
 The campus used to be very small then
 vibhinn vibhaagon or skulon ke rup main aaj jitna bada campus he, tab utana bada nahin hua karata tha
 Students from one school interacted with students from another school
 baithken yaa to dhabas par yaa librari main hua karti thim
 It used to be something that i no longer see, because the various centers have become far away from each other
 vibhinn skulon ke chaatro ke bich baatcheet bhi ab bahut kam hoti he
 As soon as my MA was completed, i sat for the Administrative Services examination and was successful
 do shandaar saal bitaane ke baad maine jeenyu choda
 If i were to brief the JNU of my time, some of the things i would like to say are - its fantastic faculty, complete freedom for students and a vibrant and intellectual campus
 jeenyu main barabari kii bhaavana bahut ucch str kii thi kyonki yahaan ke chaatr vibhinn parivesh or prishthbhumi se aate the
 The kurta-jeans culture, which the students here always wore, brought everyone to a common level and thus there was a feeling of mutual respect and appreciation for each other's social and economic background
 maine yahaan vibhinn prishthbhumi vaale mitra banaae, jo aaj tak mere dost bane hue hai
 It was also a period when many students of JNU opted for government services with a commitment to change the country and do something for the weaker sections
 vastav main, jeenyu main vidhyaarthiyon ko milane vaala bahuaiami drushtikon unhen prashasnic sevaaon main safal hone main madad karata tha
 This makes JNU twenty over other institutions
 mere hi hostel main ek hi manzil par rahane vaale ek dost—asif ibrahim intelligence beuro (ibi) ke nideshak bane
 Alok Joshi became the chief of Raw
 phir ek or dost es
 Jaishankar became foreign secretary
 mere kai sahpaathiyon ne iees or iesces main pravesh kiya or bharat ke vikaas main mahatvapurn yogadan diya
 Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is also a distinguished alumnus of the university
 mere samay main, jeenyu ke kulapati, faikalti or chaatr ekajutata ke saath kaam karte the
 Often we could see students and faculty members protesting together on some national or international issues
 chaatro ko niyamit rup se giraftaar kiya jaataa tha
 Many of them were regularly taken to Tughlaq Road Police Station, but the university administration and teachers always supported the students
 vahaan rajnatik bhedbhaav yaa pratishodh jaisaa kuch nahin tha
 VC and faculty jointly run the university
 yah swaittata kaa pratik tha
 i think the solidarity i used to see in my time is missing now
 aksar, chaatr ek taraf hote hai, manjament duusari taraf jabaki shikshak puri tarah se ek alag ravaiya akhriyaar kiye rahete hai
 These three components must work together
 ve bhavishya main jeenyu ko jahaan lekar jane kii laalasaa rakhte hai uske liye unamem ek aam najariya hona chahie
 The selection system of students at JNU should be improved
 chayan pranali samay ke saath lachar ho gai he
 Selection should be merit based
 jeenyu ko post graduate str se hi apane paathyakram shuru karne chahie
 Undergraduate courses may only be permitted in the School of Languages
 chayan prakriya main amulchul badlaav kii aavashyaktaa he
 No matter what, the university must produce the best students
 unhen bhartiya shiksha pranali kii sarvottam misaal hona chahie
 It is necessary that good students get opportunities here
 jeenyu ke chaatro ko jivan ke har kshetra main utkrushtataa hasil karne kii koshish kerani chahie
 JNU was designed as an excellent center of education
 focus ucch gunvattta vaale shodh par hona chahie
 Subject-focused research and more publications from JNU are required
 vartmaan main bahut kam shodhakarya ho rahe hai
 The number of published papers has reduced
 jeenyu aisi alag-thalag sanstha banakar nahin rah saktaa jo apni vichaardhaara kii duniya main hi khoyaa rahe
 The administration should assure that various ideologies co-exist in the university
 jeenyu ko duniya ke sarvottam vishvavidhyalayon stenford, harvard, emity or oxford jaise sheersh vishvavidhyalayon ke saath sahyog or sampark sthapit karnaa chahie
 There was also a time when BHU was probably the best university in the country
 sarvapalli radhakrishnan ko keval unki yogyata ke aadhaar par vishvavidhyalay kaa visi niyukt kiya gaya tha
 He later became the President
 aisa hi elahabaad vishvavidhyalay tha, jisamen dakshin bharat ke kai utkrisht shikshak padhaate the
 The selection of teachers was based on talent
 sattar ke dashak ke madhya se yogyata par jati, dharm or kshetravaad haaavee ho gaya
 Political interference began to increase
 nateeja yah hua ki kai vishvavidhyalay apni pratishtha or viraasat ganvaate gaye
 The rule of giving preference to merit should be brought back
 jeenyu ko apni viraasat ko barkaraar rakhana he, to use shikshakon or chaatro kii gunvattta main sudhaar karnaa chahie
 Finally, multidisciplinary trends should return to JNU
 keval raajnneeti nahin honi chahie
 Arts, culture, music and sports should also be given full boost
 jeenyu ke kai skulon main duniya main ucch shiksha ke behtareen sansthaanon ke rup main ubharne kii kshamta he, is disha main eemaandaaree se prayaas shuru hona chahie

 Scientists at the University of Reading have finally found an answer to the question as to why the country experiences drought conditions due to heavy snowfall over the Himalayas during the winter and spring seasons, especially during the early part of the summer monsoon
 vishvavidhyalay kii ek vijyapti ke anusaar, 1980 se hi vaigyanikon ko yah maaloom tha ki himalay par himpat adhik hone se bharat main garmiyon ke monsoon main hone vaali varsha kam hoti he
 However, scientists did not even have an answer to the question as to why this happens
 climet dynamiks main is saptaah prakashit naye anusandhan main mausam vibhaag yaa hedli centre mausam model ke aadhaar par prakriyaaon kaa adhyayan kiya gaya he
 This shows that more snowfall leads to greater reflection of sunlight and this leads to freezing of the Himalayas
 iske kaaran himalay se aane vaali ve monsooni hawaaen kamjor ho jaati hai jinke chalate bharat main varsha hoti he
 This weather relationship is strongest in the absence of hot (el Niño) or cold (al Niña) conditions in the tropical Pacific because it generally controls Indian rainfall effectively
 is anusandhan ke pramukh lekhak da endi turnar ne kaha, ‘hamaare adhyayan ne yah pradarshit kiya he ki ushnkaribandheey prashanth se prabhaav kii anupasthiti, himalay or tibeti pathaar main barfbaari kii paristhitiyaan hone kii sthiti main bharat, khaastaur par uttari bharat main june maheene kii shuruuaat ke baad mausami monsooni barish kii bhavishyavaanee kii ja sakati he
 'he said,' The time of onset of monsoon is very important for agriculture, the lack of rain at the beginning of the sowing season can have a very bad effect on the crops
 ’ Former BCCI president n Srinivasan is looking for his return on the 'boycott Champions Trophy' agenda
 shrinivasana ko supreme court ne hiton ke takaraav kaa maamla saamne aane ke baad bisisiai se vidaa lene kaa aadesh de diya tha
 After this, Srinivasan was away from the board for some time
 lekin ab wo waapas board main panth jamaane kii koshish main jute gaye hai or iske liye unhone chunaa he champions trophy or bisisiai-isisi vivaad kaa mudda
 What is the dispute between the BCCI and the ICC regarding the entire Mamlarajaswa model is no longer hidden from anyone in the entire cricket world
 isisi apane faisle par adig he or virodh ke taur par bharat bhi kuch kade kadam uthaane par vichaar kar rahaa he
 One of them is to boycott the Champions Trophy
 lekin champions trophy kaa bahishkaar karne se bhartiya cricket par badi aanch aa sakati he or isisi se sambandh bhi bighad sakate hai
 But for the most ineffective n Srinivasan, it is proving to be a big way to return to the BCCI
 board main shrinivasana lobby sakriy ho chuki he or wo jor-shor se adhikariyon ke saamne ye maang rakh rahe hai ki bhartiya cricket team ko champions trophy main na bheja jaae
 According to DNA, Srinivasan is currently in touch with the cricket board of about ten states
 in rajyon ne bhi bisisiai se saaf kah diya he ki bharat ko champions trophy nahin khelni chahie
 However, whether the BCCI-ICC controversy will turn, whether India will play the Champions Trophy or not, the answer to these questions is far away, but it is certain that many rotis are being baked in the heat of this controversy

 pathankot air base par aatanki hamale ke baad vayusena ne aise kai kadam uthaaye jisamen air base kii suraksha ko abhedya banaaya ja sake
 For the first time, the Air Force has started a special QRT ie Quek Reaction Training School for its air warriors
 iskaa naam he van sicurity training skool jiskaa makasad har air base kii suraksha ke liye pehali raksha pankti taiyaar karnaa he
 In this episode, the Air Force is giving special training to its airmen and officers
 jisase aane vaale dinon main kisi bhi aatanki hamale ko naakaam kiya ja sake
 Apart from regular training for Air Force Airmen and Officers, this is special QRT training
 ajtak par padhiye kaise air force ke khaas van sicurity training skool bhatinda main kaise ban rahe aatank kaa khatma karne vaale air varirs
 This four-week special training provides rigorous physical training along with modern weapons
 training menvayusenake airman or officer ko ek saath training di jaati he, training bahut kadi hoti he
 They have to go through many stages during training
 isamen javaanon ko hawa main, pani main or jangal main ghaat lagaakar maar karne kii takanic sikhaai jaati he
 Equipped with modern weapons, these air warriors are in the trend to identify and eliminate the enemy even in the dark of night
 pathankot aatanki hamaleke vakt aatanki air base ke aasapaas maujuud jangal or ghasphoos kaa phayda uthaakar andar daakhil hue the
 Special training is given to thwart such an attack in training
 maakke drilakuch sandigdh jangal or ghasphoos kaa phayda uthaakar air base ke andar daakhil ho chuke hai
 In such a situation, the first reaction was taken over by the Quek Reaction Team
 gaadi se furti se utarate hi kuarti ne apni-apni pojishan sambhaal lee
 As soon as the firing started, we also wore bullet proof jackets and helmets keeping in mind our safety
 aatankiyon ne grined se hamalaa or firing shuru kar di
 The QRT team also started counter-firing
 kuarti team ke jawan teji ke saath sandigdh aatankiyon kaa peechha shuru kar dete hai
 Taking advantage of the forest, the terrorists manage to enter a building inside the air base
 aise mushkil or chaunkaane vaale haalat se ladane ke liye hi vayusena apane javaanon ko taiyaar kar rahi he
 The entire focus of the QRT team is that under no circumstances are the suspects able to succeed in their plans in the air base
 isi tarah kii har mushkil haalat main jawan kaa asli saathi uskaa hathiyaar hota he
 With one bullet an enemy's mantle, the jawans are aiming at their targets
 najdiki ladaai main achook nishaanaa bahut jaruri hota he isiilie yahan par har jawan puri siddt se nishaanaa laga rahaa he
 This series of firing takes several rounds to hit the surefire target
 bhatinda air base ke stesan commander group captain es pasrichaa ke mutabik har maukey par kaise dushman ko koi mauqaa na mili sara jor is baat diya jaataa he
 Let us tell you that there is a special part of this training, hiding yourself according to the area of asafas, Camoflage and Consolidation class
 is oparation ke dauraan jawan kuch khaas tarah kii dress pahanakar aasapaas kii ghasphoos main chup jate hai
 During the camouflage and concealment operation, when some soldiers were engaged in this mission, they could not find the hidden soldiers and suddenly the soldiers hidden in the grass were shocked
 darasal vayusena ke zyaadaatar base doordaraj or bade ilaakon main faile hue hote hai
 In such a situation, their safety is a big challenge
 bade ilaake main faile air base, hawaii pattee or uske saath maujuud samrik taur par ahm hawaii jahaajon kii suraksha ek badi chunauti he
 In such a situation, it is not easy to chalk the entire security of the air base to just a few security personnel
 isiilie har airman ko kuarti kaa hissaa banaaya ja rahaa he, yani har airman commando banakar aatankiyon kaa muqabla kar sake
 Training of soldiers Training of youth is becoming very difficult
 jangal ke ilaake main barudi surang or khai ko paar karte hue dushman kaa peechha karnaa
 During this operation, the jawans are moving ahead by making a pair of big piers
 kadam-kadam par khatra badhata ja rahaa he
 All the soldiers are moving cautiously
 saavdhaanee hati durghatana ghati kii tarj par is mishan ko anjaam dena he
 Soundless creeps from under barbed wire
 aage mushkilen or bhi hai pani ke talab main apane hathiyaar ko bachaate hue aage badhanaa he
 The motive behind this hard training is that the soldiers fire, water firepower to shield themselves in all kinds of circumstances
 van ests mukhya prashikshak wing commander manpreet singh ne bataaya ki barudi surang, talab or khai ko paar karke jawan apane mishan ko puraa karne main kaamyaab rahe
 Training to combat the terror attack in the night, now we tell you how to deal with terrorists if you try to infiltrate during the night
 haal ke dinon main pathankot se lekar uri main hue aatanki hamale raat ke andhere kaa phayda uthaakar hi hue hai
 In such a situation, special training of Knight Patrolling is being given to these Air Force personnel
 raat ke vakt petroling main bhi saavdhaanee ke saath aage badhanaa padataa he
 Then suddenly all the soldiers take their positions with the sound of firing
 vayusena kii is kuarti training main khaas baat he ki mahila adhikri apane purush saathiyon ke saath kandhe se kandhaa milakar apni jimmedaari nibhaa rahi hai
 Women officers are also going through all the difficulties of QRT training
 prashikshak scadran leader mihir mehta ne bataaya ki aatank ke badhate khatre se nipatane kii is khaas training main mahila or purush adhikari or jawan ek saath har tarah kii shaareerik or maansik chunauti se jujh rahe hai
 For the first time after the Pathankot terror attack, five batches have been passed in the Forest Security Training School, started at Bathinda Air Base of the Air Force
 yahaan se kuarti kii khaas training lekar nikle air variyar desh ke alag air base par morcha sambhaal chuke hai
 In the coming days, the Airforce will open such a special security training school so that every air base in the country can build the first strong defense wall to combat terror
 namaskara main raveesh kumaar, raajnneeti main aap jiske kilaaf apana vajood banaate hai, usee se us vajood ko bachaane ke liye haath milaanaa pad jaataa he
 It has happened and it has happened
 iskaa hausala is baat se miltaa he ki janata ne ek samay main ek ajoobe ko sweekaar kiya he to riject bhi kiya he
 When politics means winning the election, then the loser also does what the winner does
 bihar main nitish kumaar or lalu prasad yadav ke saath aa jane se agar aap asahaj mahasoos kar rahe hai to aap apwaad nahin hai
 You know that by-elections are to be held in Bihar on August 21 for ten seats
 narkatiyaganj, rajnagar, jaale, chhapra, hajipur, mohiuddeen nagar, parbataa, bhagalpur, baankaa or mohaniya
 RJD and JDU have reached an agreement for these ten seats in the assembly
 mahinebhar se kam samay main pataa chal jayega ki mandal ne koi gul khilaayaa or kamandal khilaa hi rah gaya
 It is true that everyone was fighting Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha, but no one was fighting together
 haarane waalon ko raahat pahunche isliye ek data tablet kii tarah supplai kiya gaya ki bijepi ko puure desh main sirf 31 pratishat vot mili, jabaki 69 pratishat vot khilaaf main pade
 31 to UPA in 2009 too
 5 pratishat vot mili the
 Still, can Modi be challenged by adding any new old vote bank out of this 69 percent? bihar main modi gathbandhan ko 39 pratishat vot mili the
 Combining the votes of Congress, RJD and JDU, it gets around 45 percent
 kaagaz par aisa hi guna bhaag chunaav se pehle kiya gaya tha jisamen badhat ke baavjood modi ko bahumat nahin mil rahaa tha
 The same Farra is being removed from the sleeve in Bihar
 ek minute ke liye maan lete hai ki modi lahar ke baavjood bihar ke in teen dalon ne alag−alag hi sahi bijepi se zyada vot hasil kiye
 45 percent of the vote
 phir ye sawaal bhi aata he ki tamaam antarvirodhon ke baavjood pichhadaa−ati pichhadaa, dalit−mahadalit bijepi ke saath gaya ki nahin gaya
 If not, then how would BJP get 31 seats out of 40
 90 ke dashak main mandal ne kamandal ko roak diya tha
 But in 2014, BJP put Mandal in the same kamandal
 pichhadaa garib chywala hindutv or vikaas
 Modi made a cocktail that the mocktail of the Lohiaites failed
 sanghathan or prachaar kshamta main to modi virdohi dal aaj bhi lachar or lupt praaia dikhte hai
 Overall, backward castes and Dalits also considered Modi as their leader
 har jati samaaj se modi ke liye vot pade
 In UP, Modi reduced Mayawati, who carried her vote bank in the pocket, to zero
 kahin aisa to nahin ki aaj bhi lohiabaadi, ambedkarwaadi apni raajnneeti ke usee pinjre main fanse rah gaye or tota ud gaya
 Will the parrot come back to the cage
 kisi bhi gathbandhan kaa ek rajnatik auchity hota he to ek naitik or prakritik auchity bhi hota he
 Why did Nitish Kumar take such a big risk or what fodder did he have
 jab bijepi ramvilas paswan kii party se gathbandhan kar sakati he jo lalu ke dashak puraane sahyogi rahe or nitish bijepi gathbandhan virdohi rahe to nitish lalu ke saath kyon nahin ja sakate hai
 But we are not weighing potatoes on scales
 idhar ek kam hua to udhar se ek chadha diya
 How can Nitish explain to the people of Bihar who could not understand so much that he left Narendra Modi because he could not compromise on the question of secularism
 bihar kii janata ne nitish ke vikaas ke model ko bhi riject kar diya
 Trusted more on the unseen but listened model of Gujarat
 yah dhyaan rakhana chahie ki loksabhaa main bihar kii janata ne nitish ko tab bhi chhod diya jab ve lalu ke saath nahin the
 Rather, Lalu fought against him and showed cleverness, preventing the Congress from going to Nitish
 paswan par lalu or jediu donon kii nazar thi magar bijepi le udi
 Does Nitish really no longer believe in his model of development? ise aap nitish kaa master stroke kahenge yaa stroke maar dene par master dawaai
 If not saved, otherwise 2004 main sonia gandhi ne bhi yahi kiya tha
 Alliances had been raised in front of the strong Atal Bihari Vajpayee leadership
 vaajapeyi haar gaye
 Even when the BJP had great faith in the issue of Sonia's foreign origin
 kya nitish yah formula vaaki bihar main dohraane kii sthiti main hai
 In our politics, there have been and will continue to be unethical and untrustworthy alliances
 ham apni naitikta kaa paimaana apni suvidha ke anusaar chunate rahenge or ek gathbandhan se dil lagaakar duusare ko gariyaate rahenge
 Did not the socialists join hands with the same kamandal in the long period of Congress opposition
 kya inhen congress virdohi samaajwaadiyon ne congress se haath nahin milaayaa
 Did Mamata Banerjee not become a co-passenger of the Congress government after leaving the Congress? kya sharad pavaar ne videshi mul kaa mudda uthaakar usee sonia gandhi kaa netritv nahin sweekaara
 Who is confident that Sharad Pawar will not tie up with the Shiv Sena tomorrow
 aisi khabaren to udati hi rahati hai
 Did the BJP not fight the familism of Akali, Shiv Sena and Ram Vilas Paswan, which came out to fight the dynasty of Congress
 apni party ke bheetar parivaarwaad ko andekha nahin kiya
 There is no guarantee that the BJP will not compromise with Chautala's party
 loksabhaa main akali dal ne chautaala kii party ke liye prachaar kiya bijepi ne andekha kiya
 Chautala's father and son were sent to jail in the teacher recruitment scam
 philhal zamaanat par hai
 BJP came back after Yeddyurappa was fired and did the public not vote
 kya bihar main congress ko khatm karne vaale lalu ne congress se gathjod nahin kiya
 There are many examples
 in udaahranon se raajnneeti main aap koon tak maaf kar sakate hai
 The question is, of the credibility of an alliance at a particular time
 makasad kaa
 In Nitish's brand Bihar, his own fabricated, how will Lalu's Jungle Raj mix
 prime time
 While Ayodhya (ayodhya), the birthplace of Lord Shri Ram, is the center of the faith of Hindus, but the 'bajrangbali' in Hanuman Garhi here is decorated with flowers brought by a Muslim man named Nazim
 itnaa hi nahin, najim kii patni chunni ke haathon gunthi phulon kii maala bhagwaan hanuman ke gale kii shobhaa badhaati he
 Najim Ali, a family of Jamadar Purwa, located in the Wazirganj development block on the gonda-ayodhya highway in Gonda district of Uttar Pradesh, cultivates flowers
 inke bageeche se chunakar ayodhya laae gaye phool hi hanumangadhi main chadaaye jate hai

 Then life would be happy

 bhartiya share bazaar pichley kuch samay ko dekhte hue lagaataar oochaal par rahane vaala dikh rahaa he
 Perhaps this is the reason why equity mutual funds have recorded record money in the last two years
 bahut-se aise niveshak jo pehali baar mutual fund (saajha kosh) main paisa laga rahe hai yaa jinhen share bazaar kii khaas jaankaree nahin he, ve bhi aaj bade aatmavishvaas se mutual fund main paisa laga rahe hai
 But before investing money in it, you must do some research because there are many mutual funds in the market at this time
 isamen bhi nivesh ke liye ek anushaasan jaruri hota he jiskaa paalan agar na kiya jaae to munafa prabhavit ho saktaa he
 Lump-sum investment: Lump sum investment in mutual funds is not correct as market movements can prove risky
 behatar hoga ki systmetic investment plan (esaypi) ke jariye nivesh kiya jaae
 Investing through sips helps in averaging the purchase costs, ie, average returns in the midst of market fluctuations
 agar aapke paas ekamusth rakam he to kisi date fund main nivesh karnaa or phir kisi equity fund main systmetic transfar plan shuru karne main hi samajhadaari he
 Choose the fund on the basis of fresh performance, when the market is doing well, then most of the fund performs well
 jab share bazaar main giravat aati he to fund chunaav main saavdhaanee baratane kii zyada jarurat hoti he, sabhi kosh apni vailu main giravat nahin roak pate
 Therefore, it is important to look at the long-term performance of the fund while investing
 yah bhi dekhnaa hota he ki utaar-chadhaav main uskaa pradarshan kaisaa rahaa
 Do not blindly run after any of the best performing mutual funds
 sectoral fund main niveshjab bazaar oochaal par ho to thematic yaa sectoral fund (kshetra vishesh vaale kosh) market ke mukaable behatar pradarshan karte hai
 Banking and Infrastructure Funds have performed very well in the last one year and have given returns of 32 and 25 per cent respectively, while largecap diversified funds have given returns of 18 per cent
 lekin apni inakam kaa bada hissaa in koshon main lagaana uchit nahin he kyonki ye bhi jokhim vaale sabit ho sakate hai—fund kaa pradarshan kisi ek sector yaa theme par nirbhar hota he
 If the stocks of that sector fall, then they are the most hurt
 iske alaava achche ritern ke liye inamen nivesh karne or usase baahar nikalne ke sahi samay kaa bhi chunaav karnaa chahie
 One should always invest according to their ability to take risk
 dirghakaalin lakshya ke liye labhaansh kaa vikledgar aap lambii avadhi ke liye nivesh kar rahe hai to acha rahegaa ki aap growth opshan kaa vikalp apanaaen kyonki aisa karne se aapke munaafe ko phir se nivesh kar diya jaataa he or samay ke saath usamen vruddhi hone lagati he
 But this is not the case with a dividend option, where a portion of your profits are denied the Net Asset Value (NAV) and given to you
 dividend opshan tabhi chune jab aapako paison kii jarurat ho, anyathaa growth vaale vikalp ko chunanaa hi samajhadaari hoge
 Also, you should not choose the dividend option as a regular income because some funds have a good history of paying dividends but there is no guarantee

 google doodle ke jariye vishwa prasiddh chitrakaar jaimini raay kii jayanti manaa rahaa he
 Born in West Bengal, this painter gave a distinct identity to Indian art across the world
 20veen shatabdi ke shuru ke dashakon main chitrakaari kii british style main prashikshit jaimini raay ek prakhyat chitrakaar bane
 For nearly 60 years, Jamin Rai visualized the revenge of the world including India
 yahi vajah he ki unhen aadhuniktaavaadi mahaan kalakaaron main se mana jaataa he
 In 1955, in recognition of his contribution to the arts, the Government of India honored him with the Padma Bhushan
 tippaniyan The painting of Jaimini Rai has an indelible impression of nationalist movement, literature and art
 bataaya jaataa he ki jaimini raay ne shiksha grahan kii avadhi jo kala style sikhi thi, use chhodkar 1920 ke baad ke kuch varshon main unhen kala ke aise naye roopon kii talash thi, jo unke dil ko choote the
 For this, he drew inspiration from a variety of sources such as the East Asian style of writing, the art of temples made of terracotta temples, valleys, folk art objects and craft traditions, etc
 1930 ke dashak tak apni lok style kii chitra kalakritiyon ke saath-saath jaimini raay portret bhi banaate rahe, jisamen unke brush kaa prabhavi dhang se istemaal najar aata tha
 Surprisingly, he also made very beautiful simulations of paintings of great artists of Europe
 1920 ke baad ke varshon main raay ne gramin drishyon or logon kii khushiyon ko prakat karne vaale chitra banaae, jinamein gramin vaataavaran main unke bachapan ke laalan-paalan ke bhole or svachhand jivan kii jhalak thi
 He was born in 1887 in Beliatore village in Bankura district in present-day West Bengal, so it was a natural attempt for him
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki is kaal ke baad unhone apni jadon se najdiki ko abhivyakti dene kii koshish kii
 This world famous painter died in the year 1972
 jaimini raay kii chitrakaari main rashtravaadi andolan, sahitya or kala kii amit chhap dikhti he
 Jamini Rai is said to have been looking for new forms of art that touched his heart in the few years after 1920, except the art style he had learned during the period of education
 iske liye unhone vibhinn prakaar ke sroton jaise purv asian lekhan style, pakki mitti se bane mandiron kii kala vallariyon, lok kalaon kii vastuon or shilp paramparaon aadi se prerana lee
 Jamini Rai portraits continued to be used, along with his folk-style portrait artworks until the 1930s, in which his brush was effectively used
 aashcharya kii baat he ki unhone europe ke mahaan kalakaaron ke chitron ko bhi bahut sundar anukritiyaan banaain
 In the later years of 1920, Rai created paintings depicting rural scenes and people's happiness, reflecting the naive and free-spirited life of his childhood upbringing in a rural environment
 ve 1887 main vartmaan pashchim bengal ke bankura jile ke beliator gaanv main janme the, isliye yah ek prakaar se unke liye swaabhaavik prayaas tha
 There is no doubt that after this period he tried to express his proximity to his roots
 saal 1972 main is vishwa prasiddh chitrakaar kaa dehanth hua tha

 However, due to the environmental conditions, neither can operate the plane here, and for the satellite, this place is located at a very low altitude

 Why is this dangerous step, China's success can prove to be very dangerous for India
 china ke vaigyanik is koshish main lage hue hai ki aise drone banaae jaaen jo niyar spes main rahete hue salbhar tak kisi jagah par nigahen banaakar rakh sake

 saath hi jaanch agency ne in aaropon par bhi aapatti jataai ki is maamle main uski jaanch main eemaandaaree kii kami he
 Senior counsel KK Venugopal, appearing for the CBI, told a bench of Justices GS Singhvi and AK Ganguly, the investigation so far, regarding the forced coercion by Maran in the sale of Aircel to Malaysia's Maxis Group Evidence not found
 unhone kaha, shuruaati jaanch main yah tathy saamne aayaa he ki malaysia kii company si shivashankaran kii company kaa adhigrahan karne se pehle mantri or unke bhai ke sampark main thi

 venugopal ne kaha, do sitambar ko pesh sthiti rapat ko lekar galat reporting or galat vyakhya kii gai
 The investigating agency also expressed displeasure over the allegation of NGO Center for Public Interest Litigation that there was little honesty in the investigation in the case
 venugopal enjio ke vakil prashanth bhushan dwaara daayar us arji kaa ullekh kar rahe the ki abhi tak jaanch agency ne jo bhi jaanch kii he vah nichali adaalat main tik nahin paaegi
 He said, Prashant Bhushan has recorded a statement against the CBI in the application

 BJP is badly stuck on the Ram temple issue
 yogi adityanath kal ayodhya gaye the ki wo ram mandir ke mudde ko phir se raajnneeti ke centre main sthapit kar denge
 But the questions of saints surrounded him such that he had to run towards Delhi to warn the Sangh from the situation
 ram mandir ke liye yogi adityanath ne sabar rakhane kii salaah di or santon ne do took kah diya ab or intjaar nahin ho saktaa
 Mahant Ji of Gorakhpur is beginning to realize that the patience of Ayodhya Mahants at the temple is missing
 vaise bhi 32 baras se dhairya hi to rakhe hue hai
 What is there other than patience in the slogan of Ram temple from Advani's chariot to Modi's rule
 1998 se 2018 tak shriram ke ayodhya arohan ke intjaar main madi main rahane vaale bhaajapai mehalon main rahane lage
 The chariots started flying in Boing, and in Hanumangarhi the aarti stood with folded hands that when the lotus would blossom from Lucknow to Delhi, Lord Rama's exile would also end
 lekin is intjaar ko na viraam laganaa tha or na laga
 Now the alienated forest dwellers on the BJP say that we do not know the court-court
 Now we need a Ram temple in Ayodhya
 yani ki 2019 se pehle ramamandir ke mudde ko bijepi ne rassi se phir utaar liya he
 When he wished, when he wished, and when he wished
 aadhe log kehete hai court ke faisle kaa intjaar karenge or aadhe kehete hai ki court kachhari kuch nahin ram mandir par idhar-udhar kii baat or nahin
 In fact, BJP is feeling that the grace of 2019 is stuck in the Ram temple itself, so when the Hanumangarhi was celebrated on the pretext of Mahant Nritya Gopaldas' birthday, the Mahanta Chief Minister also had to be beheaded
 sabar kii is apil par saadhuon kii mandali aapa kho baithi he or bijepi funs gai he
 When Yogi Adityanath met the saints in Ayodhya, he understood that he is not ready to entertain anymore
 isliye wo fouran dilli ke jhandevalaan bhaage
 The announcement of Pravin Togadia's Ayodhya Cooch, giving accounts to the RSS, has made it difficult
 ayodhya ko apni raajnneeti kii duusari rajdhani bana daalane vaale yogi adityanath kii samaj main nahin aa rahaa he ki santon ko sambhala kaise jaae
 Not a single saint could find sympathy with him in Ayodhya
 aise main vakf board ke ikbaal ansaari ne unke liye jo bol kahe hai usase unhen thandak mili hogi
 Iqbal Ansari said that some people are torturing CM in the name of religion
 pradhan mantri narendra modi na keval puri mehnat se kaam kar rahe hai balki apane mantriyon or maatahaton se bhi jabardast dhang se kaam le rahe hai
 He works 18 hours a day and his routine starts at 6 am
 yah khabar ek aarthik samachar patr ne di he
 According to the letter, PM Modi only does a lot of work himself but expects the same from his colleagues
 isse sarkaar kii chusti bad to gai he lekin mantriyon ke chehron par havaaiyaan udne lagi hai
 It is difficult for his 44 ministers
 abhi sarkaar bane teen hafte bhi nahin hue hai ki mantriyon ne apen mitron ko kahana shuru kar diya he ki piem kaam lene ke maamle main kaaphi sakht hai
 Many ministers are looking sleepy and many people have started to get sick due to work pressure and stress
 piem modi ke yahaan subah-subah kaam shuru ho jaataa he
 There are some ministers who had the habit of taking a nap in the afternoon but all that is over now
 ab to unhen der raat tak jaagnaa padataa he
 The problem of BJP ministers is that they were out of power for many years and their habit of working was over
 ab ve din-raat kaam kar rahe hai jiskaa asar saaf dikh rahaa he
 The letter cites the surveyor Ram Vilas Paswan of Lok Shakti Party, writing that recently when some journalists went to meet him, his eyes were turning red, when asked about this, he said that this happened due to the heat of Delhi
 is
 lekin unke ek sahyogi ne bataaya ki mantri ji pehle dopaher se kaam shuru karte the lekin ab unhen piem ke saath kadam taal karnaa padataa he jiskaa asar dikh rahaa he
 There is another minister who used to start work only after having lunch, but now starts work in the morning
 unhen ab apane sehat kii chintaa sata rahi he
 The same situation is with Nitin Gadkari
 vah bhi dopaher se dincharya shuru karte the lekin ab vah ekadam subah uthakar lag jate hai
 PM Modi's first call goes to him only
 gopinath munde ke nidhan ke baad se un par doguni jimmedaari aa padi he
 There are many ministers who have two ministries and are buried under the burden of work
 patr ne bharosemand sutron ke hawaale se likhaa he ki bajet satr ke pehle hi cabinet kaa vistaar hoga
 Its purpose is to lighten the burden of burdened ministers
 kuch mantriyon se atirikt mantralay le liye jaaenge

 Some youths opposed women, while religious leaders condemned the youth
 jaankaree ke mutabik, kanpur ke dhaknapurva kshetra main kareeb ek darjan se zyada muslim mahilaon ne ravivaar ko safai abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii
 As soon as the women took the broom, the local youth started protesting
 yuvakon kaa kahana tha ki unhen safai abhiyaan se pareshaani nahin he, lekin yah sab burka pahanakar nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Not only this, the youth alleged that these women dressed in burqas do not belong to Muslims but belong to the Hindu community
 safai abhiyaan main shaamil ek mahila ne bataaya ki unke samudaay ke hi kuch yuvakon ne abhiyaan ko galat tehraaya
 The woman said, 'people told us that if we do all these things then we are not Muslims but Hindus
 ' vah aage kahati hai, 'jab desh ko saaf rakhane ke liye pradhanmantri jhaadu uthaa sakate hai to kya ham mohalle ko bhi saaf nahin kar sakate
 On the controversy arising out of the praise of Qazi and Shi'a Dharmaguru, Qazi of the city said that the burqa is a veil of Muslim women
 agar vah burka pahanakar safai abhiyaan main juty hai to sharia ke mutabik isamen koi galat baat nahin he balki khushi he ki unhone parade main rahakar abhiyaan ko shuru kiya he
 The Shia cleric Kalbe Jawwad also condemned the statements of Muslim youths, calling women right
 unhone kaha, 'yah to haddees main bhi likhaa hua he ki mohalle or ghar ke aasapaas saaf-safai kerani chahie
 Women should not make it an issue to join the cleanliness drive
 yah ek acha kaam he
 BJP state president Laxmikant Vajpayee also gave a statement on the blasphemy case
 unhone kaha ki piem modi kii kaarypaddati sava sau karod bharatiyon ko saath lekar chalane vaali he
 He started the cleanliness mission not for any religion caste but for the good of the country
 aise main iskaa virodh karne vaale yuvakon kii maansikta or nishtha saaf jhalkati he
 Vajpayee appealed to the women that they are not afraid, BJP is with them

 janalokapal ke liye anna hajaare or arvind kejariwal ke saath kandhe se kandhaa milakar chalane vaale justise santosh hegade dilli main aam aadmi party kii sarkaar banane se khush hai
 He described the Lokpal Bill passed in Parliament as weak, but also said that if we were adamant on a strong Lokpal, it would not be available
 aage is kanoon main sudhaar ho sakate hai
 Read excerpts from a special conversation with Santosh Hegde
 prashn:kya aapako lagata he ki arvind kejariwal ne anti karpshan campagne or civil sosayadi ko kamjor kiya he, kyonki pehle unhone congress kaa virodh kiya or phir uski hi sahaayta se sarkaar bana rahe hai?hegade:mujhe nahin lagata he ki isse koi nuksaan hua he kyonki agar kejariwal ne sarkaar nahin banaai hoti to vah lokshahi kii haar hoti
 Everyone was saying that he should not form a government
 lekin mujhe lagata he ki lokshahi main kisi na kisi ko gavarment banani padati he
 If elections were held for the second time, the burden would fall on the public
 or apni sharton or apane mulyon se samjhauta kiye bina wo kisi kii bhi sahaayta se sarkaar banaae, usamen koi harj nahin he
 In India, it is common for states to form a joint government
 prashn:kya anna arvind kejariwal ko saport karte to isse zyada siten aa sakati thim?hegade:agar anna arvind ko open saport karte to aam aadmi party ko isse zyada siten mil sakati thim
 Question: When Arvind Kejriwal decided to form the government and asked Anna about it, he said no comment
 or jab unako shapathgrahan samaaroh main aane kaa nyotaa diya gaya, tab anna ne kaha meri tabiyat thik nahin he
 Does this seem to have caused a rift between the two? Hegde: i don't think it is because Anna's health is not good for a long journey
 anna swasth nahin hai or nimantran bhi ab milanaa shuru hue hai
 i too got an invitation today
 main aaj raat deree se bengalooru pahunchoongaa, isliye main bhi vahaan par nahin ja saktaa
 This does not mean that i do not support Arvind
 mujhe nahin lagata ki kejariwal or anna ke bich koi matbhed he
 Question: What will you say about the Lokpal bill that has just passed? Hegde: i do not think it is a strong Lokpal
 desh pichley 45 saalon se is kanoon ke liye lard rahaa tha or hamaara aakhri makasad bhi kanoon laana he
 Once the law comes then it can be improved
 agar ham majboot lokapal kaa hi aagrah rakhte to ye bhi nahin hota
 Question: What will you say about the 2014 Lok Sabha elections? Hegde: The next election is very important
 abhi hue pichley chunaavon main bijepi ne acha pradarshan kiya he, haalanki usne karnataka main sarkaar khoi he
 They cannot say yet who will get the majority but whatever happens will be interesting

 People want a good government but what do people think in the village
 mujhe pataa nahin he
 People wanted change in Delhi and they also brought it
 'digital india' ke sapane ko hakeekat main badalane par sarkaar kaa bahut jor he
 Especially since the announcement of demonetisation, there has been a focus on adopting digital methods instead of cash for payment
 cashles iconomi or digital karency kii ore kadam badhaane ke saath hi online tranjection badhegaa
 In such a situation, the possibility of increasing cyber economic crime cannot be ruled out, but how serious the government is to deal with cyber crimes, it shows that the post of the chairperson of the Cyber appellate Tribunal has been lying vacant for the last five and a half years
 
 agar koi sibar aarthik aparaadh kaa shikaar hota he to sabase pehle bank or police kaa darwaja khatkhatata he
 The police cyber cell crack the case and get the offender punished, but how can the victim be compensated for the financial loss? If there is any fraud in the case of online cash transactions, it is very difficult to get justice at the moment

 64 karod rupye kharch kiye ja chuke hai
 According to sources, 80 per cent of this expenditure was incurred to pay the rent of the Tribunal's office, which is in Connaught Place, Delhi

 Pakistani website 'the Nation' claimed that the weapons recovered from the terrorists at the airport were India-made
 aapako bataa den ki aatanki sanghathan taharik-e-taliban pakistan (titipi) ne is hamale kii jimmedaari le lee he or pakistani rangers ke pravaktaa ne bataaya he ki shuruaati jaankaree ke mutabik hamalavar uzbekistan ke hai
 Geo News also did something similar

 (breaking News) DG Rangers says Indian made weapons recovered from terrorists # karachiairport— Geo English (@geonews_english) June 8, 2014 Such claims were made on social media as if India had waged a war against Pakistan

 At least eight people have been killed in the violence in the city so far
 vali babar naam kaa yah samvaadadaata guuruuvaar raat apane ghar laut rahaa tha, tabhi agyaat logon ne use roak kar kareeb se goli maar di

 Union Minister Piyush Goyal is going to present the last and interim budget of Modi government today
 pichley kai bajet bhaashanon par gaur karen to paaenge ki isamen bade bade badlaav hue hai or bhaashanon kaa focus vruddhi or vikaas se hatakar kisaan or digital kranti par kendrit hua he
 If you analyze the last 5 budget speeches of Modi government, you will find that UPA-2 and Narendra Modi's NDA government have played a lot of words and technology has also played an important role in it
 upie-2 banaam endie: kuch shabd jo baar- baar dohraye gayeupie-2 or endie sarkaar ke bajet bhaashanon main kai shabd aise rahe, jo baar- baar dohraye gaye or logon ne barambar is par focus bhi kiya
 While the upa's budget was development and investment focused, it saw a big change in the focus of the NDA
 2015-16 main nivesh naamak shabd dobaaraa waapas lautaa or us saal ke bajet main isaki gunj dur tak sunai padi
 Till earlier this year, people were almost accustomed to these words by listening to development and investment, when the pattern of budget speech changed and farmers came to the center point
 doosraa shabd jo sabase zyada upyog kiya gaya, vah he gramin vikaas or gaanv-kisaan
 During UPA-2, the words peasant were heard 47 times and 81 times in the NDA budget
 donon sarkaron main dogune kaa antar tha
 Now talk of 2017-18 budget
 yah notebandi ke baad kaa daur tha
 The term digital was the most prevalent in this year's budget
 iske baad vikaas or kisaan shabd sunne main aae
 Whereas in 2018-19, the entire budget was changed and 'infrastructure' was overshadowed by all the words
 garibon kii chintaa kise?chaunkaane vaali baat he ki garibon kaa daawa thonkane vaali upie-2 kii sarkaar main garib shabd kaaphi kam sunaae pade jabaki endie ne ise khub aage badhaayaa
 Poor words were heard only 5 times in upa-2's budget speech, 65 times in NDA
 upie sarkaar kii tulana main yah 13 guna zyada tha
 Who has redeemed Ganga Maiya the most? There may be a government that did not mention the purity and turbidity of the Ganges, but in this the two governments remained almost the same
