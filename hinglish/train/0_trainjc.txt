 At this, the court asked the LG counsel to tell whether all the appointments made by the commission were illegal or some of them were wrongly kept

 It is a coincidence that on World Environment Day, we saw this green dhaba at Gajraula on the way from Lucknow to Delhi
 neshnal haive 24 par mekadonalds or keeffsi ke saath sthit 'bhajan' dhabas ko hindustan kaa pehla green dhaba kahana galat nahin hoga, kyonki abhi tak upi yaa desh ke kisi or hisse main hamen aisa dhaba nahin mila he
 You must have heard more about the food of a restaurant or restaurant
 lekin bhajan dhabas kii khaasiyat iske architekchar se shuru hoti he
 The 'laurie Baker' style architecture allows space to be placed inside the walls, so that it does not trap air or heat and therefore keeps the room temperature cool in summer and warm in winter
 itani garmi main bhi is jagah aap sirf pankhe ke sahare aaraam se baith sakate hai
 The head has not been used anywhere in the entire dhaba
 eenton kii chhaton ko karv dekar is tarah banaaya gaya he taaki sara bhaar donon taraf 'beam' par pade or sariye kii zarurat naa pade
 For minimal use of cement, the lid of the clocks has been installed periodically, which in addition to saving the cement makes it a beautiful design
 har jagah puraani lakdi lagaayi gayi he
 The doors from the old houses are fitted
 puraani inte kaam main laayi gayi hai
 Because its architecture is not common in India, so workers were first trained for this and then started making
 isse zyaada khalis khaanaa aap or kahaan khaaenge, jab dhabas ke peeche padi khaali zamin par ugaai subjiyan sidhe dhabas ke khaane ke liye istemaal hoti hai
 The leftover food is used to make bio gas
 isi baio gas se dhabas kii do-tihaai gas kii aapurti ho jaati he
 Dhaba owner Vikramjit Singh Bedi claims that this bio gas plant is the largest bio gas plant in Uttar Pradesh
 baio gas se nikali khaad phir peeche ugaai subjiyon ke kaam aati he
 There is also a rain harvesting system which stores rain water
 shauchalayon or safai ke liye risaikal kiye pani kaa istemaal hota he
 It is estimated that in the next few years, the ground water level of the ground will rise by 3-4 feet due to accumulation of rain water
 dhabas main san windo lagaayi gayi hai taaki suraj chhipane tak yahaan chota sa balb jalaane kii bhi zarurat nahin pade or is tarah takreeban 30% bijli bachaa lee jaati he
 Vikramjeet told that he has 3 more such dhabas
 lekin vahaan par abhi sirf is tarah kii rasoi hi kaam main laayi jaati he
 These dhabas have been in existence since 1969 at the time of his father
 is green dhabas kaa pichley saal oktober main udghaatan kiya gaya lekin abhi unka kaam puraa nahin hua he
 He wants to do many more new experiments in this dhaba right now
 vikramjit ke pita kaa kahana tha ki jis zamin ne itnaa diya he, use zyaada se zyaada lautaaya jaye
 The comments vikramjit kii maa madhu chaturvedi hindi kii mashhoor kavyitri bhi hai
 In addition to feeding people good food, this family also tells people about their dhabas happily and wants others to start like this
 bhajan dhaba sirf khaane kii jagah nahin, balki paryaavaran kii ek paathshaala bhi he
 Vikramjit Singh Bedi has also requested some schools to bring their students here so that they can learn about environment and energy accumulation from a young age
 apni soch or lagan se itnaa sab karne ke baad bhi ye parivaar is dhabas main bijli ke liye bijli vibhaag ke chakkar laga rahaa he
 But for the last 15 months, they have not been able to get electricity
 kaaran aap samaj hi gaye honge
 On Environment Day, it is not enough to just think and speak for the environment, but like Bedi family, some new positive steps also need to be taken
 kisi dhabas kii yaa restaraan kii zyaada taareef aapane uske khaane ke bare main hi suni hogi
 But the specialty of Bhajan Dhaba begins with its architecture
 'lorie baker' style architekchar main deevaaron ke andar spes rakhaa jaataa he, jisase ye hawa yaa garmi ko trep nahin karti or isliye garmiyon main kamare kaa taapmaana thanda or sardiyon main garam rahata he
 Even in such heat, you can sit comfortably at this place only with a fan
 puure dhabas main kahin bhi sariye kaa istemaal nahin kiya gaya he
 The roofs of bricks have been made in such a way by giving a curve so that all the load falls on the 'beam' on both the sides and there is no need for a shield
 cement ke kam se kam istemaal ke liye ghadon kaa dhakkan bich-bich main lagaaya gaya he jo cement kii bachat ke saath-saath ise ek khubasurat dizine bhi banaata he
 Old wood has been installed everywhere
 puraane gharon se nikle darvaaze feet kiye gaye hai
 Old bricks are used
 kyonki iskaa architekchar bharat main aam nahin he, isliye iske liye pehle mazaduron ko training di jaati thi or phir bananaa shuru kiya jaataa tha
 Where else would you eat more than this, when the vegetables grown on the empty land behind the dhaba are directly used for the food of the dhaba
 bache hue khaane ko baio gas banane ke liye prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 Two-thirds of the dhaba gas is supplied with this bio gas
 dhabas ke maalik vikramjit singh bedi kaa daawa he ki ye baio gas plant uttar pradesh kaa sabase bada baio gas plant he
 The compost released from bio gas is then used for the vegetables grown behind
 saath hi ek rain harvesting system bhi he jo barish ke pani kaa sanchay karata he
 Recycled water is used for toilets and cleaning
 anumaan he ki agle kuch saalon main barish ke pani ke sanchay se zamin kaa ground water level 3-4 fit upar aa jaayegaa
 Sun windows have been installed in the dhaba so that there is no need to light a small bulb here till the sun is hidden and thus about 30% of electricity is saved
 vikramjit ne bataaya ki is tarah ke unke 3 or dhabas hai
 But only such kind of kitchen is used there
 1969 se unke pita ke vaqt se ye dhabas astitv main hai
 The Green Dhaba was inaugurated in October last year but is yet to be completed
 wo is dhabas main abhi kai or nae prayog karnaa chaahate hai
 Vikramjit's father said that the land that has given so much should be returned as much as possible
 tippaniyan Vikramjit's mother Madhu Chaturvedi is also a famous Hindi poetess
 logon ko acha khaanaa khilaane ke saath-saath ye parivaar logon ko apane dhabas ke bare main kushi-kushi bataata bhi he or chahta he ki baaki log bhi is tarah kii shuruyaat karen
 Bhajan Dhaba is not just a place to eat, but also an environment school
 vikramjit singh bedi ne kuch skulon se anurodh bhi kiya he ki wo apane vidhyaarthiyon ko yahaan laaen taaki wo choti umr se hi paryaavaran or urja sanchay ke bare main sikh saken
 Even after doing so with their own thinking and dedication, this family is going round the electricity department for electricity in this dhaba
 lekin pichley 15 maheene se inhen bijli nahin mil paayi he
 You must have understood the reason
 paryaavaran diwas par ab paryaavaran ke liye sirf sochna or bolnaa hi kaaphi nahin balki bedi parivaar kii tarah kuch nae sakaaratmak kadam uthaane kii bhi zarurat he
 The head has not been used anywhere in the entire dhaba
 eenton kii chhaton ko karv dekar is tarah banaaya gaya he taaki sara bhaar donon taraf 'beam' par pade or sariye kii zarurat naa pade
 For minimal use of cement, the lid of the clocks has been installed periodically, which in addition to saving the cement makes it a beautiful design

 "petrus bone" is a crude but useful part of the human skull — basically it protects your inner ear
 lekin yah bas itani hi rakhwali nahin karata
 In recent years, genetic scientists involved in extracting DNA from ancient skeletons have found that a particular part of the petrous bone (the part that protects the cochlea) has a much higher density and is many times 100 times larger than any other tissue
 DNA can be extracted
 ab is achook khoj se bharat ke itihaas ko lekar chalane vaali sabase garmagarm bahes kaa jawaab mil saktaa he
 When the complete results of the study of the remains of a "petrous bone" of a 4,500 year old skeleton from Rakhigarhi, Haryana, will come to light, then some of the best minds of our country's history and science, as well as some questions that have troubled many politicians, The answers to this should be as follows- Question: Were the people of Harappan civilization the basic source of Sanskrit language and culture of Vedic Hinduism? Answer: No
 prashnh kya bharat kii vartmaan jansankhya main unka jin ek mahatvapurn ghatak ke rup main maujuud he? uttarah nishchit rup se
 Question: To which of the popular conceptions of "aryans" or "dravidas" were they close? Answer: Dravidians
 prashnh ve aaj ke dakshin bharatiyon or uttar bharatiyon main se kisase milte the? uttarah dakshin bharatiyon se
 All these questions are certainly controversial

 Why did it take so long? a year ago, when this writer spoke to Shinde, an answer was received, "this is a politically very sensitive issue
" ''scindia ne sitambar 2017 main apane shodh ke nishkarshon ko prakashit karne kaa vaada kiya tha
 Archaeologists were referring to the fact that any research on the Harappan civilization would have to collide with the Hindutva agenda of the central government — whose politics demands Vedic Hinduism to reveal the origins of Indian civilization
 itihaaskaaron yaa harappakalin athwa sindhu ghati sabhyataa par kaam karne vaale kisi bhi vyakti ke liye yah baari duvidha kaa maamla he
 Indeed, when the Indus Valley Civilization was first "discovered" in the 1920s, colonial archaeologists readily accepted it as evidence of the civilization-culture of the pre-vedic period and a new theory of "aryan" invaders
 Dia and said that the Aryans from the north-west laid the foundation of Hindu India by completely destroying the Harappan civilization
 baad ke varshon main mukhyadhara ke adhikansh itihaaskaaron ne "arya akraman siddhant'' ko ek atisarleekaran bataate hue khaarij kar diya—jabaki us kalkram dharna ko sweekaar liya jo vaidic sabhyataa ko sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke uttaradhikari ke rup main sweekaar karti he
 The doctrine of Aryan invasion stunned the Hindutva advocates of nationalism, even as it has its roots in the origins of popular politics in South India that sees the Indus Valley civilization as a Dravidian culture

 Great aspirations Meanwhile, who exactly the people of the Indus Valley Civilization were, it still remains a mystery

 You must have also heard the name of Rakhigarhi: In the last decade and a half, the name has been prevalent in textbooks, tourism pamphlets and media as India's largest region of Harappayugin / Indus Valley

 In spite of the exaggeration put it, in intermittent excavations here since the late 1960s, it was recognized as a vast municipal system dating back to the 7th millennium BCE
 sabase mahatvapurn baat yah he ki gaanv main khadey saat tile ise isa purv duusari or teesri sahasrabdi ke "viksit'' hadappa nagar vyavastha kii site ke rup main sweekaare jane ke liye paryaapt saboot pesh karte hai
 It is a city that flourished as India's first city civilization and was mysteriously destroyed more than 4,000 years ago

 This is important because the "R1A1", often referred to as the "aryan gene", is now said to be originally of Bronze Age cattlemen who lived in the Central Asian "pontic Steppi" (black Sea and Caspian) Moved to other places about 4,000 years before) in the meadows that span the middle of the ocean

 Neeraj Rai, the chief genetic researcher of the Rakhigarhi DNA project, says, “we are not referring to R1a
 aar1e vahaan nahin he
 "of course, his confession was wrapped in rhetoric, but it was evident that the data presented in this paper were derived from the genetic material of Rakhigarhi's" I4411 "which is a male — R1a mutation (mutation)
 Is seen only in samples of the male y chromosome
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa se kisi vyakti ke pehle jinom namoonay main is anuvanshik pahchaan kaa na paaya janaa us avadharana ko majbootee detaa he jis par anuvanshik vaigyanikon, itihaaskaaron or bhashavidon ke bich pehle se hi aam sahmati he—sindhu ghati sabhyataa pehle se hi astitv main thi or yah pashupalkon, ghode or rath kii sawari karne vaale, kulhadi evam anya hathiyaaron se las, proto-sanskritbhaashi pravaasiyon, jinke vansh aaj uttar bhartiya samudaayon kii ucch jatiyon main sabase spasht rup se dikhte hai, se ekadam bhinn thi
 Rai says that the haplogroup R1a is not visible in Rakhigarhi specimens, because a limited amount of genetic data has been obtained from there
 yaa phir aisa bhi to ho saktaa he ki rakhigadhi ke us pracheen nivasee main heplogrup aar1e maujuud hi na ho
 Rai said, "we don't have much coverage about the y chromosome regions (genome)
 ''unka kahana tha ki unhone apane namoonay main mitrocondrial or autosomal diene se zyada data nikaala tha (mitrocondrial diene test se matra vansh or autosomal test se mata-pita donon se judi anuvanshik jaankaree praapt hoti he)
 However, he insisted that "a large number of Central Asians migrated and this significantly altered the South Asian genetic structure" and that the inhabitants of ancient Rakhigarhi "have no connection with Central Asians
" ''duusare shabdon main, jabaki sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke nivaasiyon kaa is vansh main se koi bhi sarokaar nahin tha to aap aam bhartiya pathakagan yah jaan len ki aapke jin main purush nasl kaa 17

 So, now we know who our 4,500 year old ancestor "I4411" was
 to phir ve koun the? raay ke anusaar sankshipt uttar yah he ki aai 4411 kii "dakshin bhartiya janajaatiy aabaadi ke saath zyada ghanishtataa dikhti he

 shodhpatr kaa ek masauda bataata he ki is vyakti ko vastav main irula ke zyada kareeb (ek purvaj jaise anuvanshik gunon vaale samooh) rakhaa ja saktaa he
 
 
 But not to the same groups as Punjabis, which have a high proportion of Western Eurasian race
 report aage kahati he ki rakhigadhi ke nivasee sambhawatah koi dravid bhashaa bolte the
 However, the results also show clear evidence of mixing genetic with other populations outside the subcontinent, considered "iranian farmers"
 yah ek aabaadi he jise pracheen diene ke purv adhyayanon main pahachaanaa gaya tha or yah is pariklpana ke anuroop he ki krishi takanic kaa prasar pashchim asia ke "upjau kriscent'' ke sampark main aane se hua jise 5veen se 8veen sahasrabdi isa purv main ureshian krishi ke udgam sthanon main se ek ke rup main sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 For the older generation of Indians, Rakhigarhi's conclusion may sound like what he had read in school books and need to read again: "dravidians" came from the meadows of Stepi, the Vedic era horsemen after the Harappans
 or jo log janasankhyikeey anuvanshiki kii haalia ghatnaon par najar rakhte hai ve is naveenatam nishkarsh se saamne ai baton se purv parichit honge
 Meanwhile, whatever coverage the recent research of archaeological or genetics of India of the Harappan era has focused in the popular press to the extent of forcibly wandering the "invasion theory of the Aryans"
 iskaa kya arth he? or kyon isse fark padataa he? iskaa jawaab is tathy main miltaa he ki haal ke varshon main pracheen bhartiya itihaas par bahut maathapai hui he
 Large speculations were being made before the news of the findings of the deceitful study

 Shinde was asked to make a gesture to propagate that the result of Rakhigarhi was the "offspring" between the current residents here (mainly Jats, who are thought to be descendants of R1a steppe pravashis) and residents of that ancient city

 In January this year, a Hindi newspaper published an article based on interviews with Neeraj Rai, stating that the DNA derived from Rakhigarhi is indeed very similar to the DNA of North Indian Brahmins and its findings would establish that prevailing fact
 That India was the "place of origin" for indo-european speakers

 Here, detailed and esoteric discussions on the outstanding points of molecular evidence were often dismissed with comments such as "you're stupid" or "you'll need a psychiatrist when the results come out"
 or ab tak jo kuch chhanakar baahar aa rahaa he, usase to yahi lagata he ki weslovski kii vah bhavishyavaanee ki "harappavasiyon main koi aar1e nahin tha balki ve dakshin bharatiyon ke kareeb the'' sahi sabit hone vaali he

 Golwalkar's book Bunch of Thoughts (1966) is inspired by an aggressive quote in which Golwalkar writes, "it was a deceitful propaganda spread by sly foreign Britishers that we were never a nation, we were never children of this soil

 There was another trick in this, trying to hide that a significant genetic part of the North Indians belonged to people outside this subcontinent
 lekin aisa lagata he ki jo baat chupaane kii koshish hui, vah is saal ujagar ho jaaegi kyonki ek taraf jahaan rike or unki team dwaara harvard main taiyaar ek shodhpatr main yah tathy ubharkar aane kii ummid he, vahiin duusari taraf rakhigadhi pariyojna kaa netritv karne vaale vaigyanikon kaa nishkarsh bhi kuch aisa hi he
 a "pre-publication" format of this paper (commonly referred to briefly by Schm Narasimhan et alia) was made public in April, with a flat title such as the Genetic Formation of South and Central Asia

 Shinde said that he had insisted on the first draft of his letter to Rike that reference to immigration in South Asia should be avoided
 yaa yun kahen ki unhone suzav diya ki kuch spasht kehane kii bajaae bich kaa rasta nikaalte hue adhik mahatvakankshi shabd "interection'' yaa parsparik prabhaav shabd kaa istemaal kiya jaae
 For this reason, Shinde made Raik very obstructive on the way to reach the samples of Rakhigarhi, while Raik was keen to work on him seriously
 aisa isliye kiya gaya kyonki yah ek bada khatra hota or vastav main shodhpatr se "pravaas'' shabd to gaayab dikhataa he

 He also had some contact with South Indian tribes
 ''ek patrika ko die haalia saakshaatkaar main, scindia vicitra rup se yakeen ke saath yah bataa gaye ki rakhigadhi ke pracheen log "aadhunik hariyanviyon jaise lambey or tikhe nain-naksh vaale'' the
 Shinde cited the surname of Wazir Chand Sarave, a prominent local historian of Rakhigarhi, stating that it is a surname of the Dalit community but is similar to 'sirohi Jat'

 This contact also continued with the people living in Swat after Harappa (1200 BCE – 1 CE)

 On getting the information, the local police also got into action and started investigating
 jismfaroshi kaa ek international racket tha, jise ek ritred karnal or kansaltent mil kar chalaa rahe the
 In the racket, high profile foreign girls were served to rich and influential people
 lekin jab in rasukhdaar logon main fouj ke bade afasaron ke bhi shaamil hone kii baat saamne ai, to maamla achaanak se sangeen ho gaya
 So is this the case with Honeytrap? Is it that the intelligence of the security of the country is being stolen with the help of these girls? When the Income Tax Department raided this house of Delhi's posh Safdarjung Enclave, people got a routine action
 lekin jald hi is makaan ke andar se inakam tex department ko aise-aise raaj pataa chale ki maamla police ke hawaale kar diya gaya
 Within a month, shocking stories of crimes like sex racket, honeytrap, forgery, cheating, illegitimate bargaining came out of this house
 vaise to ye makaan pien sanyaal naam ke 62 saal ke ek shaks kaa he, jo khud ko technical kansaltent bataata he lekin kansaltanti kii aad main sanyaal ne yahaan se kaise-kaise gul khilaa rakhe the, iskaa khulaasa ab jaakar hua he
 Foreign girl found imprisoned in house The most shocking thing that happened to the police in the Income Tax Department raid was a foreign girl imprisoned in Sanyal's house
 darasal, iti kii red ke dauraan afsaron ne is makaan ke bathroom main ek uzbek ladki ko band paaya
 Who had also cut the nerves of his wrist in desperation
 tab is ladki ko aspataal main bhartee karavaaya hi gaya, jab usase poochtacha hui to pataa chalaa ki wo sanyaal ke sex racket main fansi ek aisi ladki thi, jiske passport or duusare travel document sanyaal ne jabt kar liye the or jise wo amir or rasukhdaar logon ke saamne paros rahaa tha
 Apart from this, police also got passports and other documents of five-six more foreign girls from Sanyal's house
 racket kaa sargana ritred karnalinakam tex department ke baad ab police sanyaal par apana shikanja kar chuki thi
 But when Sanyal began to open his mouth, the mask of many rich and influential people began to be removed
 lekin isi ke saath jis ek ahm shaks kaa cheharaa benakaab hua, wo tha fouj kaa ek ritred karnal ajay ahlavat
 In fact, in Bijwasan, Ajay Ahlawat, a polo event and a hospitality, hotel business named after 'the Risala', was the real player of the sex racket exposed from Sanyal's house
 sanyaal ne ahlavat ke saath milakar naa sirf sex racket chalaane kii baat kubul kii, balki ye bhi bataaya ki kis tarah wo videshi ladakiyon ko bandhak bana kar ye sara kaarobaar chalaa rahaa tha
 The 'honeytrap' connection of the sex racket, but if it was Mahdud till the sex racket, it was a privilege
 lekin yahaan sanyaal jaise-jaise khulaase kar rahaa tha, uske baad pulisavaalon ke bhi kaan khadey ho gaye
 In fact, Sanyal said that the customers of Colonel Ajay Ahlawat's sex racket included politicians, businessmen and bureaucrats as well as senior officers of the army
 jinhen aksar sanyaal ke isi thikaane se videshi ladkiyaan bhijwai jaati thim
 In such a situation, the police was shocked
 ab sawaal ye he ki kahin in videshi ladakiyon ke zarie sanyaal or ahlavat hanitrap kaa racket to nahin chalaa rahaa tha? kahin aisa to nahin ki in ladakiyon ke zarie ye racket afasaron se fouj kii khufia jaankariyaan nikalava kar uskaa galat istemaal to nahin kar rahaa tha? tafteesh lagaataar aage bad rahi he
 This case does not just point towards Honeytrap by way of jismforshi and jismforshi, but it has traces of many crimes like fraud, forgery and fraud
 ab tak kii chaanbin main jahaan ye pataa chalaa he ki ye dhandhebaaj hai sosayadi main videshi ladkiyaan bhej kar apana manachaaha kaam nikaala karte the, vahiin police kii maane to is sex racket ke sargana ritred karnal ne kai logon ko karodon rupye kaa chuunaa bhi laga rakhaa tha
 The entire game was raided by foreign girls, police and income tax department and their hideouts brought such things that people were stunned
 sanyaal ke ghar se police ko chah videshi ladakiyon ke passport or travel document ke alaava do saansadon ke letterpad or railway ke coupon main bhi mili
 This made two things clear
 awwal to ye ki sanyaal or karnal ahlavat mil kar videshi ladakiyon kaa sex racket chalaa rahe the
 And for this same black business, both of them had also held many girls hostage
 ye phone par hi apane customer se order lete or munhmaangi keemat par unhen alag-alag thikaanon par videshi ladkiyaan muhaiyaa karaate
 But the old and big player in his business used to do people a favor through fake letterheads of Sanyal mps and railway reservation coupons
 yahaan tak ki usne kai baar khud ko farji tareeke se netaa or saansad bataa kar kaarobaariyon ko phayda pahunchane kii koshish kii

 a similar case has come to light in Madhya Pradesh after the release of fake notes of two thousand in delhi-up
 madhyapradesh ke damoh main atm se bina number vaale 500 ke note nikle hai
 There was a stir in the area after the occurrence of unbuttoned notes from the State Bank ATM in the city hospital

 Actually, a person named Narayan Prasad Ahirwal withdrew money from State Bank ATM at Hospital Chowk on Monday afternoon
 narayan ne atm se ek hajaar rupe nikaale jisamen paanch sau ke do note nikle
 The surprising thing is that only serial numbers were missing from these notes
 iske baad do or logon ne bhi ek-ek hajaar rupye ke note nikaale to unke paanch sau ke note bhi bina number ke the
 In this way, the number of 6 notes of five hundred, without number, created a situation like stirring around
 khabar milte hi state bank se pramukh kaisier sunil jain bhi pahunch gaye
 Sunil Jain says that they are investigating whether the notes are fake or have any errors

 haalanki spain ke netritv ne is janamat sangrah ko khaarij kar diya tha
 On the other hand the courts had also asked to stop it

 It gained autonomy (swarajya) before the Civil War in Spain
 saal 1939 se 1975 ke bich general francisco franko ke netritv main catelonia kii is swaittata ko khatm kar diya gaya tha
 However, when Franco died, the demand for freedom of Catalonia began again
 bharat kaa ye vitt mantri bana tha pakistan kaa pehla pradhanmantriiskaa nateeja yah hua ki saal 1978 ke samvidhan main iske purvottar ilaakon ko phir se swaittata deni padi
 After this, in the year 2006, the powers of Catalonia were increased under an Act
 is bich catelonia kaa aarthik dabadabaa badha or vah ek raashtra ke rup main dekha jane laga
 However, it did not last long and the Spanish court withdrew all powers in 2010, which angered the Catalonia administration
 lambey samay se chal rahaa tha vivadcatalonia lambey samay se spain se alag hone kii maang kar rahaa tha
 Catalonia had greater financial dominance and the people there alleged that they were not getting the benefit of it
 haal hi main is vivaad ko lekar hinsa bhi badi or catelonia main hinsa ke bich ek janamat sangrah karavaaya gaya, jisamen bhaag lene vaale 90 fisadi logon ne spain se alag hone kii maang rakhi
 Why Catalonia Catalonia has its own parliament

 It also has its own regulatory and overseas representative offices for telecommunications, thereby promoting Catalonia's trade and investment worldwide

 The credibility of the Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) is becoming an important issue for various political parties before and after the election
 haal main hi paanch rajyon main hue vidhansabha chunaav main se teen rajyon main jitake baad bhi congress party ne isaki vishwasaneeyata par sawaal khadey kiye the
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi said that even though we may have won the election, we still feel that anyone can tamper with the EVM
 EVM ko lekar uth rahe sawaalon ke bich ab mukhya chunaav ayukta sunil aroda (CEC Sunil Arora) ne ek bada bayaan diya he
 He said that this is the most reliable method of voting because the machine may be the victim of wrong maintenance but tampering is not possible
 navaniyukt siisi aroda ne EVM par raajnneetik dalon ke aaropon ke daayre main ab chunaav ayog ke bhi aane ke mudde par guuruuvaar ko kaha ki chunaav main matadaataaon ke baad raajnneetik dal hi mukhya pakshakaar hote hai
 They have every right to say what they say, but it makes me sad, we have made evms a football
 kisi dal vishesh ke paksh main chunaav parinaam nahin aane par iskaa thikra EVM par phodne kii pravriti ke bare main aroda ne kaha ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav kaa parinaam, iske baad hue dilli vidhansabha chunaav ke parinaam ek duusare se bilkul vipareet the
 Even after this, the results of the assembly elections and all the by-elections in Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tripura and now five states were completely different
 aroda ne raajnneetik dalon dwaara chunaav parinaam kii vyakhya apni suvidhanusaar karne kaa zikr karte huye kaha ki iviem mahaj ek mashin he jo aankade darj kar unki ginati karti he
 i can completely rule out the possibility of achieving special results by doing special programming in the machine
 paanch rajyon ke chunaav main iviem kii matdaan kendron se itar anya sthanon par baramadagi ke sawaal par aroda ne kaha ki mashin main chhedchhad karnaa or iskaa galat rakrakhaav do alag mudde hai
 The complaints received during these elections fall under the category of wrongful maintenance by the employees
 is tarah ke jo maamle saamne aaye hai, haalanki yah sankhya naganya he lekin phir bhi ayog kii koshish is sankhya ko shunya par laane kii he
 Asked about the demand of political parties to return to the ballot, he said that there is no question of returning to the ballot
 yah chunaav ayog kaa spasht rukh he
 The Commission has come to this point of view after deliberating on this subject several times
 (input bhashaa se) VIDEO: Dr
 kapheel ke parivaar ne lagaae kai aarope(is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) The bjp's defeat in the assembly elections held in five states and the election results of the Hindi belt in particular have raised concerns for both the Uttarakhand government and the BJP organization
 uttarakhand main 2017 main do-tihaai bahumat akele dam hasil karne vaali bhaajapa samaj rahi he ki loksabhaa chunaav main party kaa bedaa paar lagane ke liye kaaryakartaaon ko saath rakhana jaruri he
 Now the state president of BJP is saying that soon the leaders will be included in the government and the organization
 abhi rajya main loksabhaa kii sabhi paanch siten bhaajapa ke paas hai or inhen barkaraar rakhane kii badi chunauti mukhyamantri ke saamne he
 In fact, the concern is that in the recent civic elections in Uttarakhand, BJP had got fewer seats contrary to its claims
 isaki khaasi vajah kaaryakartaaon kii naaraazgi bhi maani gai
 Now in the upcoming elections in 2019, the workers in the Lok Sabha should be engaged wholeheartedly, for this, now state party president Ajay Bhatt is asking to 'adjust' the leaders and workers so that the party will unite with the Congress in the electoral contest
 Could do two hands
 udhar rajya main sattarudh trivendra singh ravat cabinet main abhi 2 mantri pad bhi bhare jane hai
 Apart from this, in addition to 'adjusting' the leaders in many corporations and commissions, the discussion of making many mlas also parliamentary secretaries has been going on continuously in the party, which has led the party leaders to the Delhi Durbar and BJP state
 mukhyamantri ravat is par abhi tak maun hi saadhe rahe hai
 But now the pressure on the party is high in view of the Lok Sabha elections and it may be heavy to avoid
 mantrimandal ke khaali do padon ke liye bhaajapa vidhayakon main ek anaar sau biimaar jaisi sthiti bani hui he
 All the 47 BJP mlas submitted their claim to the state president Bhatt for the post of minister
 par bhatta ne mantrimandal ke vistaar or chayan ko mukhyamantri kaa visheshadhikaar bataakar isse kinaaraa kar liya
 On the other hand, the distribution of tickets for Lok Sabha elections is also a challenge
 is samay rajya kii loksabhaa siton par tehri se maala rajalakshmi shah, paudi se bisi khandudi, almoda se ajay tamta, nainital se bhagat singh koshyari or haridwar se ramesh pokharial nishank saansad hai
 There are speculations that the BJP may change candidates in some seats to deal with the anti-incumbency trend
 saath hi kuch diggajon ko duusari seat se chunaav ladgaye ko bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 According to party sources, candidates can be changed for Tehri, Pauri and Haridwar Lok Sabha seats
 philhal, bhaajapa netritv ek-ek loksabhaa seat par baariki se manthan kar rahaa he or bataaya ja rahaa he ki in paanch siton par ummidavaaron ke naamon kaa elaan chaunkaane vaala ho saktaa he
 The legislators are also eyeing the vacant two seats in the cabinet along with the concerns of preparation and claim for the Lok Sabha elections
 pichley dinon bhaajapa ke pradesh karyaalay main party ke vidhanmandal dal ke saath hi sanghathan ke kor group kii bhi baithak hui
 The same day of both these meetings were held by BJP mlas as a good opportunity and somehow presented their claim for the post of minister in front of the state president Bhatt
 sutron ke anusaar, mantrimandal ke atirikt bhaajapa ke sabhi shesh 47 vidhayakon ne mantri pad ke liye apana daawa jataa diya he
 To justify this claim, a variety of arguments were presented, in which some described the region as the basis of caste balance
 nae chehron ko mauka dene kii baat bhi kii gai
 There is also a similar bickering among BJP leaders to get responsibility in government
 sanghathan se jude netaaon ko sarkaar main daayitv dene ke liye kaaryakartaaon kaa mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat par bhi khaasaa dabaav he
 In such a situation, it will be very interesting to see how the stream will flow after the sharing of obligations

 (photo- mohsin)mangalvaar ko kya hua sunwaayee menyachikakartaon kii ore se pesh hue arvind daataar ne kaha ki 1860 kaa samalangikta kaa code bharat par thopa gaya tha
 It also did not represent the will of the then British Parliament
 unhone kaha, 'agar yah kanoon aaj lagu kiya jaataa to yah sanvaidhanik taur par sahi nahin hota
 On this, the court said to them - you assure us that if such a law is made today, it will not be permanent
 arvind daataar ne kaha, 'agar kisi vyakti kaa yon rujhaan alag he to ise aparaadh nahin kaha ja saktaa
 This cannot be called against nature
 samalangikta beemaari nahin he
 Both sexual attitudes and sexual identities are equally facts of one's natural instinct
 ' bench main iklauti jaj indu malhotra ne kaha ki samalangikta keval purushon main hi nahin jaanwaron main bhi dekhne ko milti he
 She was commenting on Datar's homosexuality as normal and non-violent and a form of human sexuality
 centre sarkaar kii ore se pesh hue atirikt solicytor general tushaar mehta ne kaha ki yah cese dhara 377 tak simit rahanaa chahie
 It should not have any effect on matters of succession, marriage and intercourse
 is par mukhya nyaayadhish deepak mishra ne tippanee kii ki yah maamla keval dhara 377 kii vaidhata se judaa hua he
 It has nothing to do with marriage or other civil rights

 Former Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi appeared for the removal of Section 377 on behalf of the petitioners
 unhone kaha, 'dhara 377 ke hone se algebiti samudaay apane aap ko aghoshit apradhi mahasoos karata he
 Society also looks at them differently
 yon rujhaan or ling (gender) alag-alag chijen hai
 This case is related to sexual orientation
 is cese main gender kaa koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 The case of sexual instinct is also different from choice
 yah prakritik hoti he
 It comes into being as a human being
 pashchimi duniya main is vishay par shodh hue hai
 The reasons for such sexual instincts are hereditary
 dhara 377 'prakritik' yon sambandh ke bare main baat karti he
 Homosexuality is also natural, it is not unnatural
 'rohtagi ne kaha, 'dhara 377 maanavadhikaron kaa hanan karti he
 Morals change as society changes
 ham kah sakate hai ki 160 saal puraane naitik mulya aaj ke naitik mulya nahin honge
 Natural sex cannot be defined by the moral values of the British colonists of the 1860s
 pracheen bharat kii naitikta victorian naitikta se alag thi

 He said that the Supreme Court should not have changed the decision of the Delhi High Court in the case of homosexuality
 jetali kaa kahana tha ki homosexuality par supreme court kaa faisla duniya bhar main liye ja rahe kanoonee faislon se mail nahin khaataa he

 ” There will be a review of the service system in the army or the support system policy provided to the officers
 soshal media par javaanon ke shikayati video ke aane ke baad raksha mantralay harakat main aa gaya he
 The Ministry has explicitly asked the Army to review the supporting systems
 is samiksha main dekha jayega ki kya sena ke adhikari ke saath sahaayak ke taur par kaam kar rahe jawan, field ke saath-saath uske ghar par to tainaat nahin hai
 It will also be ascertained that these assistants are not engaged in work in the field as well as in the Peace Station with the officer's house and other family members
 yah sab pataa karne kaa aadesh raksha mantralay ne sena ko diya he
 The ministry has told the army that it is understandable to appoint assistants to help military officers in field stations, but this is not rational in the Peace-area (where there is peace and no war conditions)
 ab yah bhi pataa lagaaya jayega ki adhikari ke saath sahaayak kaa kaam kar rahe jawan se koi aisa kaam to nahin karaayaa ja rahaa jo uski duty of charter main nahin he
 Army Chief General Bipin Rawat himself has said that this auxiliary system, also known as the Buddy System in the Army's tongue, is very good, and involves polishing the officer's shoes and belt
 kai baar aisa dekha gaya he ki adhikari apane parivaar ke duusare sadasyon ke kaam bhi in sahaayakon se karaate hai
 According to the ministry, assistants should not be allowed to do work related to family members of military officers and housework
 haalanki sena main pehle se hi har maheene sahaayak system kaa audit hota he, lekin iskaa kadai se paalan nahin hota he
 But this will be followed strictly after the order of the Ministry of Defense
 tippaniyan At present, the Army is not in the mood to abolish the subsidiary practice, whereas it has been abolished in the Air Force and Navy
 or to or na to pakistan kii sena or na hi america kii sena main yah pratha he
 The way Army Chief General Vipin Rawat advocated this practice raises many questions
 khaskar is baat se koi inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki kai jagahon par sahaayak ke bina kaam nahin chal saktaa he, lekin yah bhi sach he ki iskaa durupyog bhi bahut ho rahaa he jis vajah se javaanon kaa asantosh soshal media ke jariye samaane aa rahaa he
 The army chief himself said that there are about 36,000 officers in the army
 sena main captain, major rank ke adhikariyon or commanding adhikari ko ek hi sahaayak miltaa he
 Officers of the top rank get two assistants
 sena pramukh ne yah jarur kaha ki bhavishya main javaanon ko sevadaar na banaaya jaae iske vikalp talaashe ja rahe hai
 Separate assistants may be appointed for such tasks
 jaankaar bataate hai ki adhikari ko sahaayak dene kii pratha aazaadee se pehle 1942 ke aasapaas shuru hui thi
 Normally the job of assistant was to help the officer in necessary work and provide security
 lekin baad main inase kai aise kaam karaae jane lage jo kaam naukar se karaae jate hai
 For example, from polishing shoes to washing clothes
 sena main jis jawan yajna pratap singh ne soshal media ke jariye apni shikaayat kii thi uski patni kii maane to use bareli ke military aspataal main bhartee kara diya gaya he or kisi bhi tarah use pagal ghoshit kar sena se nikaalane kii taiyaari he
 Yagya Pratap's wife Richa's condition has now worsened as she is on hunger strike over the poor behavior of army officers towards her husband
 haalat bigadane par parivaar waalon ne use reva ke aspataal main bhartee karaayaa he
 It will be seen in this review whether the soldiers working as an assistant with the army officer are not posted at the field as well as at his house
 yah bhi pataa kiya jayega ki yah sahaayak, field ke saath-saath pis stesan main adhikari ke ghar or parivaar ke duusare sadasyon ke saath bhi to kaam main nahin lage hue hai
 The Ministry of Defense has ordered the Army to find out all this
 mantralay ne sena se kaha he ki field steshnon main sainya adhikariyon kii madad ke liye sahaayak kii niyukti kii baat to samaj aati he, lekin pis-aria (jahaan shanti he or yuddh ke halaat nahin hai) main yah tarksangat nahin he
 Now it will also be ascertained that no such work is being done with the officer working with the assistant, which is not in his duty of charter
 khud thalsena pramukh general bipin ravat kah chuke hai ki yah sahaayak system jise sena kii jubaan main baddi system bhi kaha jaataa he, behad acha he, or usamen adhikari ke juute or belt tak chamakaane kaa kaam shaamil he
 It has been seen many times that officers also do the work of other members of their family with these helpers
 mantralay ke mutabik sahaayakon se sainya adhikariyon ke parivaar waalon se jude kaamkaaj or ghar kaa kaamkaaj nahin karaayaa janaa chahie
 Although the military already has an auxiliary system audit every month, it is not strictly followed
 lekin raksha mantralay ke aadesh ke baad iskaa paalan kadai se kiya jayega
 The comments philhal thal sena sahaayak pratha ko khatm karne ke mood main nahin he, jabaki vayusena or nausena main ise khatm kar diya gaya he
 And this practice is neither in the Pakistan Army nor in the US Army
 thal sena pramukh general vipin ravat ne jis tarah se is pratha kii himaayat kii usase kai sawaal khadey hote hai
 Especially there can be no denial that work cannot be done without an assistant in many places, but it is also true that misuse is taking place due to which the dissatisfaction of the soldiers is coming through social media
 
 khud sena pramukh ne kaha ki thal sena main kareeb 36 hajaar adhikari hai
 Captains, Major rank officers and Commanding officers in the army get the same assistant
 upar kii rank ke adhikariyon ko do sahaayak milte hai
 The army chief definitely said that options are being sought to ensure that soldiers are not made serviceable in future
 aise kaaryon ke liye alag se sahaayak niyukt kiye ja sakate hai
 Experts say that the practice of giving assistants to the officer started around 1942 before independence
 amuman sahaayak kaa kaary adhikari ko jaruri kaary main madad karnaa or suraksha muhaiyaa karana hota tha
 But later they started doing many such works which are done by servant

 What is the truth? India Today anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found that this claim is misleading

 According to Pakistan's Sindh police, this fake video was made to discredit him

 Most people consider this video to be of Kashmir and are surprised at the excesses of the police 
 lekin kai logon ne is video par sawaal uthaae hai or kah rahe hai ki hamalavar pulisavaalon kii acting kar rahe hai, asli pulisavaale nahin hai
 Actually, a careful look shows that the behavior of the so-called policemen is childish
 kai logon ne coment main ise pakistan ke pulisavaale bataaya he
 What is the truth? When we searched through the keyword, we found a similar video on youtube which was uploaded on 6 May 2019
 isamen likhaa tha “sindh police ne begunaah auraton par hamalaa kiya

 ”yahi video ek or utyub yujar “earth Sagar” ne bhi 5 may ko post kiya tha
 Since the police action looked fake at first sight, we investigated this video further
 hamane urdu main kiward ke jariye is video ko dhundha - “سندھ پولیس اہکاروں کا عورتوں پر تشدد
 ”this also led to results
 fasebuk yujar “english Pathan” ne bhi yahi video May 6, 2019 ko post kiya tha jiske saath kuch urdu main likhaa tha
 Translating this post written in Urdu revealed that the viral video is fake and is part of propaganda against Jamshoro police of Pak Sindh
 ab hamane jamshoro +viral video search kiya to hamen sindh police kaa ek twit mila jo 11 may 2019 ko post kiya gaya tha
 In this, a clip of Pakistani news channel "aap news" was posted, in which it was clearly written that the people seen in the police uniform in the video are fake and did not raid any house
 ye sirf sindh police or jamshoro police ko badnaam karne ke liye taiyaar kiya gaya he
 "aap news" showed this viral video and revealed all the truth in that report
 Few Days back a video was made viral on Social media in which People in police uniform were shown torturing women while raiding a house
 This video proved fake and it was designed to malign Sindh Police in general and Jamshoro Police in particular

 kuch aise tathy or khulaase hue hai, jo sanket karte hai ki unki niyukti ke liye ek badi lobby kaam kar rahi he or samiti ko is baat ke liye prabhavit kiya ki unki niyukti ho

 kya sarkaar itani kamjor or doshi ho gai he ki uske paas sivisi ko barkhaast karne kaa saahas nahin he

 sharaab kaarobaari vijay maalya ne pravartan nideshaalay (ED) ko 900 karod rupee ke mani londring cese main video conferencing se poochtacha karne kaa prastaav diya tha, jise idi ne sire se khaarij kar diya
 The ED has also created a special forensic tool to investigate Mallya's case, which is made by combining three softwares
 idike diarector karnel singh ne aaj tak se khaas baatcheet main kaha, 'pravartan nideshaalay ne vijay maalya se video conferencing ke jariye poochtacha karne ke idia ko puri tarah khaarij kar diya
 He said, 'we do not mind whether Mallya calls himself a victim or asks for a safe haven or wishes to come back to India
 hamaari soch bilkul saaf he ki jaanch puri teji se sahi disha main ja rahi he
 The agency will not show leniency towards Mallya
 'idi ne isliye khaarij kiya video conferencing kaa prastaavidi ke diarector ne kaha ki agar bank apane bakaayaa kaa maamalamalyase video conferencing se baat karke suljhaana chahen, to ve aisa kar sakate hai
 We have no problem with this
 lekin idi ke maamle main ham is idia ke bilkul khilaaf hai
 Singh gave the reason for this that if the person concerned lies or hides something in the interrogation, then in the face-to-face questioning, he appears on the person's face, but this is not done in video conferencing
 singh ne bataaya ki maalya united browerij kii board meeting main video-kol ke jariye shaamil hue the
 Why is the new forensic tool special? The coming of time for King of Goodtimes Mallya can be difficult
 idi ne tay kiya he ki maalya se or sakhti or chaturaai ke saath nipta jayega
 Sources said that ED will use a special forensic tool (software) to investigate Mallya's money laundering case

 If yes, how much? Second- Where has all the money (bank loan) gone, is the money in India or has it gone abroad? The third important question was, who were the beneficiaries, how much money went into their bank accounts? Mallya transferred money in four countries, being told that the CBI is eyeing the five lakh transactions which Mallya has taken from different accounts

 Patidar leader Hardik Patel met Rahul Gandhi at the Taj Hotel and made his demands
 haalanki, hardik or congress donon is mulaakaat se inkaar kar rahe hai
 But for Congress, Hardik's demands can become a sore throat
 congress ke liye in maangon ko puraa karnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Rahul-hearty meeting Hardik Patel denies meeting Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, but Aaj Tak proves to be from the CCTV of the hotel
 hardik or rahul kii mulaakaat taj hotel ke 224 number kamare main hui hai
 Hardik enters the same room 10 minutes after going to Rahul Gandhi's room
 ye sisitivi footage main saaf najar aa rahaa he
 Three key terms of Hardik Patel: Hardik Patel has made many demands of the Patidar society during his meeting with Rahul Gandhi
 hardik rahul se hi nahin balki congress ke prabharee ashok gahalot ke saamne bhi apni sharten rakhi he
 Patidar reservation is the first condition, participation in government if the second condition is won, third condition is related to cases of treason
 hardik chaahate hai ki congress ye saaf kare ki kis tarah or samvidhan ke kis praavdhaan ke jariye congress agar satta main aati he, to patidaaron ko aarakshan degi
 If the Congress comes to power, then what percentage of Patidars will get leadership in the government
 iske saath hi patidaaron par hue rashtradroh ke cese waapas lenaa or patidaar yuvaaon kii hatya ke jimmedaar logon ke khilaaf karrwai karne kii baat bhi kahi
 Apart from this, they have demanded tickets for the Patidar community in those seats where the number of Patidars is more
 hardik kii maange congress ke liye musiibat kaa sababahardik kii sharton ko puraa karnaa congress ke liye tedi kheer he
 Meeting the 10 percent reservation demand for Hardik's Patidar community is the worst problem for the Congress
 gujarat main philhal 49
 5% reservation is applicable, which cannot be extended
 kyonki supreme court ke aadesh he ki 50 pratishat se zyada aarakshan nahin diya ja saktaa he
 If the Congress joins the Patidars in the OBC category, resentment in the OBC may increase
 gujarat kaa obisi samudaay congress kaa paramparaagat voter mana jaataa he
 In such a situation, the Congress cannot resent its original voter
 kyonki patel aarakshan kii maang jis samay uthi thi, usee samay obisi samudaay ne bhi patidaaron ke maang ke khilaaf aawaaj buland kii thi
 Constitutional fulfillment of reservation demand for Congress Patidars can cause trouble
 hardik ke chaheton ko tikat dena mushkilhardik kii duusari maang he ki patel bahulya siton par unke chahete patidaaron ko congress ummidavaar banaae
 According to sources, Hardik has demanded about two dozen seats from the Congress
 congress agar hardik ke chaheton ko ummidavaar banaati he, to congress ke liye jo pehle se taiyaari kar rahe hai
 They may have to face their displeasure
 rahul ne kaha tha kaaryakartaaon ko denge baharawalon ko nahin
 In such a situation, Rahul Gandhi will have to reverse his words to fulfill Hardik's demands
 iske alaava hardik sarkaar main hissedari kii bhi maang kar rahe hai, jis par congress raji hoti hai to alpesh or jignesh bhi rahul ke saamne apni sharten rakh sakate hai
 How will we act on the officers? It will be difficult for the Congress to fulfill even this matter of Hardik
 andolan ke dauran patidaar yuvaaon kii hatya ke jimmedaar logon ke khilaaf karrwai karne kii baat bhi kahi he, jo congress ke liye aasaan nahin he
 While at the same time, the Congress will not have any problem in removing the hair of treason on Hardik Patel

 On Thursday, Delhi's Deputy Governor Anil Bainal was reprimanded by the Supreme Court and even said that LG considers himself as Superman but doing nothing
 dilli ke up rajyapal par itani talkh tippanee pehali baar supreme court ne kii
 After all, why the patience of the Supreme Court on Delhi's garbage situation was broken? To understand this, let us take the Ghazipur landfill site of East Delhi as an example
 purvi dilli kii ghazipur landphil site, jisamen kooday ke pahaad kii oonchai 60 meter pahunch gai he
 If this condition remains, then in no time it will overtake Qutub Minar, whose height is 73 meters
 yahaan kooda daalane kii lagbhag 25 meter oonchai kii limit 16 saal pehle 2002 main khatm ho chuki he
 In September last year, this mountain of garbage fell down in which two people died
 iske baad alji ne kooda ghazipur kii jagah bahari dilli ke ranikheda main daalane kaa faisla kiya
 But as the people around Ranikheda agitated, the LG had to retreat and the garbage began to fall again in Ghazipur
 gajipur main kooda daalane kii jagah bane iske liye vahaan se pehle se jamaa kooda uthaane kii zarurat thi
 Soon after the September incident, LG said that NHAI would start picking up garbage from Ghazipur to build the road from November 2017 but a straw was not picked up till date
 aakhirkaar didie ne purvi dilli kaa kooda ghazipur kii jagah ghonda gujaran or sonia vihaar main yamuna kinare daalane ke liye landphil site nirdhaarit kii, lekin dilli bijepi adhyaksh manoj tiwari kaa sansadeey kshetra hone ke chalate is par brake lag gaya
 All the garbage from East Delhi comes to the Ghazipur landfill site, which amounts to 2600 tonnes daily
 jisamen se 1000 ton kaa hi nistaaran ho paata he (west tu energy plant main kooda khapaakar bijli banati he) jabaki 1600 ton bachaa hua kooda ghazipur ke pahaad kii oonchai badhaane main yogadan detaa he
 Due to which about 150 lakh tonnes of garbage has accumulated in Ghazipur today
 tippaniyan East Delhi Municipal Corporation is not able to pay salaries for the remaining three months except class-4 employees, where will they spend the waste disposal and the new landfill site
 purvi dilli nagar nigam ke meyar bipin bihari singh kaa kahana he ki 'nigam kii aarthik halaat bahut kharaab he
 We owe 10,228 crore to the Kejriwal government of Delhi, according to the fourth Finance Commission
 ham log apane karmchaariyon kii tankhwaah tak nahin de paa rahe hai
 'however, not only the East Delhi Municipal Corporation, but the condition of North Delhi Municipal Corporation is also similar for years now
 iske jawaab main aam aadmi party netaa aatishi marlena ne kaha ki 'bakaayaa purvi dilli nagar nigam kaa hamaari party kii sarkaar par nahin he balki hamaari dilli sarkaar kaa purvi dilli nagar nigam par he
 We have already given them more money as well as loan, whose interest we are not deducting because we know the financial condition of the corporation
 agar hamane byaaj kaat liya to wo safaai karmchaariyon kaa vetan tak nahin denge
 ' ab jaraa sochakar dekhen ki pehle jis jagah par kooda daalane kii limit khatm ho gai he
 Instead of disposing of garbage, mountains of garbage are being built
 is pahaad kii oonchai qutub minar ko takkar de rahi he
 Garbage is making people breathing even harder
 haadase main log apni jaan ganvaa rahe hai
 150 lakh tons of garbage has been deposited in Ghazipur alone
 pichley kuch dinon main up rajyapal dilli ke bos to the hi saath hi hameshaa se or aaj bhi wo dilli kii nagar nigamon ke prabharee hai, didie ke chairman hai, dilli police ke bos hai aise main itane taqatvar hote hue bhi ve samaadhaan karke dene kii jagah sirf daawey hi kiye ja rahe hai to supreme court kaa sabar kaa baandh to tootna hi tha
 East Delhi's Ghazipur landfill site, which has an elevation of garbage mountains of 60 meters
 yahi haal rahaa to kuch hi samay me qutubameenar ko peeche chhod degi, jisaki oonchai 73 meter he
 The limit of dumping of garbage here is about 25 meters, which was ended in 2002 16 years ago
 beete saal sitambar main ye kooday kaa pahaad bharbarakar gir padaa jisamen do logon kii maut ho gai
 LG then decided to move the garbage from Ghazipur to outer Delhi's Ranikheda
 lekin ranikheda ke aasapaas ke logon ne andolan kiya to alji ko peeche hatana padaa or kooda phir se ghazipur main dalanaa shuru hua
 In order to be a place to dump garbage in Ghazipur, it was necessary to pick up the garbage already stored there
 sitambar kii ghatana ke turant baad alji ne kaha NHAI november 2017 se sadak banane ke liye ghazipur kaa kooda uthavaana shuru karegaa lekin aaj tak ek tinkaa nahin uthaa
 The DDA finally earmarked a landfill site in East Delhi's Garh to replace Ghazipur in Ghonda Gujran and Sonia Vihar, but it got a break as Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari was a parliamentary constituency
 purvi dilli kaa sara kooda ghazipur landphil site par aata he jisaki maatra rozaana 2600 ton hoti he
 Out of which only 1000 tonnes are disposed of (waste is generated in the waste to energy plant) while 1600 tonnes of remaining waste contributes to increase the height of Ghazipur mountain
 jisase ghazipur main aaj kareeb 150 lakh ton kooda jamaa ho gaya he
 The comments purvi dilli nagar nigam class-4 karmchaariyon ko chhod baaki kii teen maheene se tankhwaah tak nahin de paa rahaa he kooday ke nistaaran or nai landphil site main karcha kahaan se karegaa
 Bipin Bihari Singh, Mayor of East Delhi Municipal Corporation, says that the financial condition of the corporation is very bad
 dilli kii kejariwal sarkaar ko hamaara 10,228 karod kaa bakaayaa dena he, chauthe vitt ayog ke hisaab se
 We are not able to pay even the salary of our employees
 ' haalanki purvi dilli nagar nigam hi nahin uttari dilli nagar nigam kii bhi haalat abhi hi nahin saalon se aisi hi he
 In response, Aam Aadmi Party leader Atishi Marlena said that 'the outstanding East Delhi Municipal Corporation is not on our party's government but our Delhi Government's East Delhi Municipal Corporation
 hamane unako pehle se zyaada paisa dene ke saath-saath lone bhi diya he jiskaa byaaj ham nahin kaat rahe kyonki hamako nigam kii aarthik haalat pataa he
 If we deducted interest then they will not even pay the salary of the employees
 ' Now just think that the place where the limit of dumping of garbage is over before
 kooda kaa nistaaran karne kii jagah kooday ke pahaad ban rahe hai
 The height of this mountain is hitting the Qutub Minar
 kooda logon kaa saans lenaa tak dubhar bana rahaa he
 People are losing their lives in the accident
 150 lakh ton kooda to akele ghazipur main jamaa ho gaya he
 In the last few days, the Lieutenant Governor was the boss of Delhi as well as always and even today he is in charge of the municipal corporations of Delhi, is the chairman of the DDA, is the boss of the Delhi Police, in spite of being so powerful, he has to give solution
 Only claims are being made in the place, so the patience of the Supreme Court was bound to be broken

 rajasthan main kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) or vivaadaaspad sidi kaa saath chhutata najar nahin aa rahaa
 If sources are to be believed, in the coming time many more cds will be in front of the public
 jabaki midwife bhavari devi hatya maamle main sibiai kaa kahana he ki uski hatya isliye kii gai kyonki vah tatkaaleen piechaidi mantri mahipal maderna or vidhayak malakhan singh bishnoi ko blackmel kar rahi thi
 She used to threaten to make public the talk of intimate relationships with him
 haalanki, sibiai abhi tak sirf ek video sidi hi pesh kar pai he jo pehle se hi saarvajanik he
 Mahipal Singh is seen with Bhanwari Devi in this CD
 malakhan singh is maamle main is vajah se aaropee hai kyonki un par bhavari devi kii teesri santan (beti) ke pita hone kaa aarope he
 The CBI has named Malkhan Singh's sister Indira Bishnoi as the main accused in the murder of Bhanwari Devi and said that her mind is behind it
 jab sibiai jaanch kar rahi thi to indira har jagah dikh rahi thi
 So everyone is questioning whether the CBI deliberately did not give him a chance to escape and go underground at a critical point so that he could accuse Indira and get another person acquitted before her arrest
 is maamle main sibiai kii jaanch or giraftaar kiye gaye logon main beshak ek vyavasthit pattern dikhataa he
 Most of the accused were arrested when the previous accused in custody were sent to jail
 inamen se kai log tab giraftaar hue, jab pichley aaropee reeha ho gaye
 In this way very few people have been questioned together
 pehali chargeshit daakhil karne ke baad malakhan or mahipal ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 By the time the CBI files a third charge sheet, the evidence against the previous two people has weakened
 chaahe jo ho, bhavari devi maamle main sibiai kii vishwasaneeyata daanv par lagi hui he
 Many incidents indicate that she is not acting as an investigative agency but as a daub, trying to save at least some senior officers and leaders, along with Bhanwari Devi and allegedly her Other girls working together had physical relationships
 rajasthan ke do bade akhabaaron ne pehle panne par yah khabaren chhaapi thim ki sibiai ne bhavari devi maamle se judi kareeb 150 sidi hasil kar lee hai, lekin sibiai ne in khabaron kaa khandan kar diya
 Now some more video clippings are circulating in which one MLA from Barmer district is seen acting
 saaf he ki inamen jis vidhayak ke hone kaa andeh he vah ghabaraae hue hai, baaki jo yah jaanate hai ki ve visidi main nahin ho sakate, ve maje le rahe hai
 India Today has revealed through its investigation that a daub conspiracy has been hatched in the Bhanwari Devi case to save some people
 sibiai ne yah sakshya jutaney ke liye li se hat kar kaam kiya he ki kis prakaar kuch sandigdhon ne mahipal madarena kii taraf shaq kii sui ghumaane kii koshish kii he
 She has mentioned in her charge sheet that many people, including many officials, were under the influence of Bhanwari Devi
 sibiai aise logon kaa naam ujagar kyon nahin karti?vah aisa karne se kaise peeche hat gai, jabaki aise log aparaadh main bhagidaar ho sakate hai yaa hatya na sahi, uske alaava kisi kaary main lipt ho sakate hai or shaayad isamen aapraadhik aaropon kaa saamana kar chuke log bhi hon? yah ahm masalaa he ki sibiai ne un logon ko nazarandaaj kiya jinke bhavari devi or uske ladakiyon ke kathith gang se tallukaat ho sakate hai
 Has he done it intentionally and is it part of the daub? CBI filed a petition before the Jodhpur High Court seeking the cooperation of the Rajasthan Police in apprehending the accused
 jab jodhpur police ne iske liye ek espi ko niyukt kiya to sibiai ne diiji rank kaa adhikari dene ke liye jor diya
 In Jaipur, the Home Department employed a special officer who is notorious for covering things up
 yah sab lipapoti ke khel kaa hi hissaa tha
 That was not enough, the CBI appointed an officer who played an important role in the Bhanwari Devi case
 yah kavayad sibiai kaa lipapoti abhiyaan jari rakhane ke liye thi? sutron kaa yah bhi kahana he ki sahi samay par or bhi kai sidi ke saamne aane kii sambhaavna he
 Truth cannot be hidden for long
 pakistan he aatankwaad kaa garh
 This is the first time this voice has come from Russia
 rus ke raashtrapati damitri medvedev ne kaha he pakistan main maujuud aatank kaa garh uske or uske mitra rashtron ke liye khatra he or isse milakar nipatna hoga
 Now Russia's forehead is also stressed
 pakistan main chal rahi aatank kii factory se ab rus bhi ghabara gaya he
 Russia is also beginning to think that terrorism that thrives in Pakistan is a threat to the world
 rus ke raashtrapati damitri medvedev ne apni suraksha seva ko saaf-saaf kah diya he ki pakistan or afghanistan se ubhar rahe aatanki khatre ko nestnabud karne ke liye apane antarrashtriya sahyogiyon ke saath kaam karo
 In a meeting of top officials of the Federal Security Service of Russia, FSB, Medvedev said that the strongholds of terror in countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan are encroaching on the interests of us and our allies
 aatank ke garh ko nasht karne ke liye hamen nishchit rup se antarrashtriya aatankwaad virdohi samudaay kaa saath dena chahie
 The key challenge for FSB
 gauratlab he ennespi soviet sangh ke jamaane kii suraksha agency kejibi kaa ek uttaradhikari he
 Earlier, at a meeting of representatives of the parliamentary party of the Duma, the lower house of parliament, Medvedev expressed concern over the Talibanisation of Pakistan
 jaahir taur medvedev kii ye chintaa bharat ke us daawey par muhar he, jisamen lagaataar kaha gaya he ki aatankwaadi pakistan kii sarajameen kaa istemaal kar rahe hai lekin, pakistan he ki maanata hi nahin

 isamen romance kaa nayaa concept he
 If Ranbir and Deepikaki are to be believed, it will not be a one-night stand between two strangers, but a one-holiday stand
 is film main veda (ranbir) or tara (deepika) ek nai jagah kii khoj main nikle hai
 But the routine spice is not there, as two strangers usually meet, fall in love or get separated
 film main donon kirdaar ek duusare se milte samay apni asli pahchaan gupt rakhane kii planning karte hai
 They meet each other as some other character, hang out together, have fun and promise to never meet each other again when the vacation is over
 isi kahani ke kuch hisse film ke traiders main bhi dikhaae gaye hai, jisaki vajah se trailor launch ke samay se hi audiyans main kaaphi utsukata bani hui he
 The trailer also shows Ved and Tara swearing to lie to each other in Croatia
 ek taraf veda jahaan khud ko 'don' film kaa don bataata he, vahiin tara khud ko mona darling bataati he
 Even after watching the trailers, it seems that like 'love Aaj Kal', 'after Break' or all such modern love stories, this film does not have things like boring break-ups
 'tamaasha' ke liye ranbir-deepika ne kiya intens liplock sineranbir kapur or deepika padukonne apni aane vaali film 'tamaasha' ke liye ek jabardast lav-mekking seen kiya he
 In this scene, lip-to-lip kisses of both actors are shown, which is being said to be quite intense
 production team ke ek sutara se film kii kahani ke bare main bhi thodaa idia mila he
 The story of the film revolves around two young people who meet in Corsica like strangers
 donon apni rosemara kii jindagi se thodaa brake chaahate hai
 Jokingly both of them disguise that they will live a false life together on the French island, in which they play the role of Dev Anand and Don to Mona Darling
 lekin anachaahe dhang se donon main pyaar ho jaataa he
 Instead of false acting, real emotions emerge
 film kaa yah lav mekking seen bahut lambaa to nahin he lekin hot or intens jarur he
 It is being told that this kissing scene of both actors is more intense than the kissing scene of 'bachna Ae Haseeno'
 film main ranbir ek story-tailor kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahe hai or deepika unki prerana bani hai

 This house is shown to him by a Tondu property broker Pawan Bhandari
 nandita makaan dekh rahi he or uske dimag main ve saare badlaav chal rahe hai, jinaki is ghar ke interior ko jarurat hogi
 On the other hand, Bhandari is thinking something while staring at this beautiful lonely young girl
 ye kyon ai he is beraham shahar main
 Will anything work kya raat main aadmi log aaenge iske makaan main
 Where is his family koi bhi he yaa nahin
 Bhandari also tries to turn around some of these questions
 magar nandita ke chehre kii sakht chuppi or tikhi nigahon ke baad uske paas ke sawaal chuk jate hai
 Nonetheless, Nandita likes the house and so a deal is struck between them

 khaas baat yah he ki nandita kaa ateet uskaa apana kam or uske apano kaa zyada he
 One day in childhood, Nandita got a jewelery box of her mother Amrita Dharkar
 usamen ek khat rakhaa tha
 Amrita, who ran a beautiful and professionally boutique catering (business of serving exotic dishes at kitty parties and other high society events), was among the elite nobles of society
 magar ye sab ek khubasurat nakaab jaisaa tha
 And the letter a key to the world beyond that mask
 jaahir he ki amrutha ko nahin pataa tha ki uski beti ne khat pard liya he
 Years passed and then when Nandita thought of coming to Mumbai to settle down, then some questions of the bygone, bygone world started coming up afresh
 kuch khaufnak yaaden nae sire se sajane lageen
 What was it that could shake the mother-daughter world
 aakhir kyon uski maa amrutha boutique cataring kaa chhadam aavaran odh jeene ko abhishpt thi
 And in the midst of all this, what about the man, the human shark, who was his father

 in / Senior Cabinet Minister of Uttar Pradesh Azam Khan attacked the Election Commission, alleging that it is acting like bjp's election office and even before the election results Narendra Modi is fighting as bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate, who Opening of the Constitution is a blatant violation
 ajam khan ne modi kii taraf ishaara karte hue kaha, 'loksabhaa chunaav ke baad chune hue netaa apane pradhanmantri ko chunate hai
 There are already contesting as prime ministerial candidates
 yah sanvaidhanik paramparaon kaa ulanghan hai
 He alleged, "the Election Commission is openly supporting the BJP and serving it like its election office
" chunaav ayog phirakaaprast takaton ke haathon kii kathputli ban gaya he
 ' ayog dwaara reliyon or sabhaaon main hissaa lene se pratibandhit kiye gaye khan ne kaha 'chunaav ayog ne ham par jo karrwai kii vah galat he
 We have proved that
 usne hamen nau april ko notice diya, jis par 11 taarikh ko paanch baje tak jawaab dena tha, lekin hamaara jawaab dekhe bagaiyr do baje se pehle ham par karrwai kar di gai
 All our constitutional rights were taken away
 ' Azam Khan said on BJP leader Amit Shah's statement that Azamgarh was the hideout of terrorists, "it is illegal to declare a district as a terrorist district
" aisa nyaayalay kaa aadesh he, lekin iske baavjood chunaav ayog ne un par koi karrwai nahin kii
 This shows that the Election Commission has become a puppet in the hands of reclusive forces
 ' Hello, Ravish Kumar
 paris kii ghatana ne hamen phir se un sawaalon ke saamne pahunchaa diya he jiskaa jawaab to ham jaanate hai magar har baar wo jawaab kuch kam pad jaataa he
 The names of these questions are different every time
 kabhi abhivyakti kii azaadi kaa sawaal, bhaawanaaon ke aahat hone ke sawaal, udaartaa or sahansheeltaa par sakant ke sawaal, uksaane se lekar aadar ke sawaal
 These were the same questions for which thousands of people took to the streets on the streets of Paris and London soon after the incident
 jo nahin utar sake wo apane-apane mulkon main twitor par utar aae or main sharli hum viral ho gaya
 a large number of people linked themselves to the cartoons made by Charley
 ghatana se aahat logon ne hatya kii ninda bhi kii
 Some people were supporting the cartoon while some were also condemning the cartoon
 kuch yah kah rahe the ki agar ye cartoon kharaab the to inhen nazarandaaz bhi kiya ja saktaa tha
 Blasphemers also included those who do not tolerate cartoons such as Charley Abdo against their religious symbols
 manahani kaa mukadmaa karne waalon se lekar twitor fasebuk par blog karne vaale bhi ninda kar rahe the
 i also blog
 sawaal uthaa ki abhiyavyakti kii azaadi kahaan tak to yah bhi kaha gaya ki seemaa kyon tay ho
 Why not as far as you want
 aaj hi islamabad ke paas takshashila main ishaninda ke ek aaropee kii adaalat se rihaai ke baad hatya kar di gai
 He did not find a place even in the cemetery
 lihaaza apane hi ghar main dafnaanaa padaa
 This mentally ill person was calling himself a Prophet
 bharat ke mashhoor chitrakaar makabool fida hossain ke saath kya hua aap jaanate hai
 Due to opposition from PK to Vishwaroopam films, this problem arises in front of us every other month
 kisi rachana yaa film kaa virodh bilkul jaays loktantric tarika he, lekin pradarshan rokna, kitaaben jalaana yaa pratibandh kii maang ghor najayas
 On the pretext of this incident, fundamentalists of other religions became active about Islam
 kal jab log marane waalon ke bare main soch rahe the ye sawaal kar rahe the ki kitne muslim deshon ne isaki ninda kii he
 Well, from Arab countries to Pakistan
 pataa nahin blosphemi yani ishaninda ke kaaran faansee or goli maarane vaale mulk pakistan kii ninda se hasil kya hua
 France, which has a representative body of 250 Muslims, has also condemned the incident
 tarik ramadan naam ke ek muslim vichaarak ne likhaa he ki pangbar kaa badla nahin liya gaya he balki hamaare mazahab or uske usulon se dhokhaa hua he
 Our colleague Aseem wrote on ndtv
com that every Muslim who has been instigated in the name of insulting Islam should ask himself what the Prophet himself would have done in such a situation
 har bachche ko bachapan se hi padhaayaa gaya he ki aalochana or gaaliyon ko lekar paigambar mohammad kitne sahansheel the
 The magazine has been producing controversial cartoons of Prophet Mohammed for many years
 daftar par hamalaa bhi hua or virodh pradarshan bhi
 But the matter never reached here
 yah saaf nahin he ki isisi aatanki sanghathan bagdadi ke cartoon chhapane ke kaaran hatya to nahin kii gai he
 Cartoons have also been made in Islam from Christian to Christian religious symbols, in Charley Abdo
 bahes ke daayre main cartoon or cartoon banane kii manshaa bhi he
 The 70s in France was the decade of youth rebellion
 is daur main dharm virdohi vyangy bhi kiye gaye
 This magazine is a creation of the same era and mindset
 kisi ne likhaa he ki ab koi is patrika ko notice bhi nahin letaa he
 Because today's France has changed a lot
 phir bhi cartoon ko lekar kai tarah kii raay he
 Many consider the cartoon to be clumsy and provocative
 twitor fasebuk par viral hone ke baad bhi kai bade akhabaaron ne cartoonon ko nahin chapa he
 But those opposing the cartoons are equally condemning the murder
 jaikab kenfield ne likhaa he ki sharli abdo ke cartoon bhayankar rup se nasli, lingabhedi or andharashtravaadi rahe hai
 Ross Douthat wrote in the New York Times that how liberal a society is shows that it has the capacity to tolerate blasphemy
 abhivyakti kii azaadi ke liye zaruri he ki ham thes pahunchane kii azaadi ko bhi sweekaar karen
 That is why it is important to defend the right of blasphemy even after the cartoon is spoiled, because if some people can kill if they say something then that thing should be said
 varna jo hinsak he uskaa libral order par vito ban jayega
 But it should not be that the matter should be written only to provoke and if people flare up then they started taking cover of freedom
 magar koi bandook taanegaa to kehane kii azaadi kaa bachaav karnaa hi padegaa
 France has a different place in the world in terms of freedom and tolerance
 vahaan ye ghatana hui he
 Keep such incidents confined to freedom of expression or let us also see why fundamentalist elements are increasing in every religion
 kyon ashishnutaa bad rahi he
 Why France's youngsters are going to work for Al Qaeda and ICIS kyon aatankwaad par ham kaabo nahin paa rahe hai
 If all the reasons are religious, then those who killed children in Peshawar were not of a different religion
 abhivyakti kii azaadi sirf dharmik pagalanapan ke kaaran sankat main nahin he
 The government is also in crisis due to the army, the capitalist and sometimes the media
 paris kii ghatana se ham kin sawaalon se mukhya rup se takaraa rahe hai
 After all, how do we deal with this madness in the name of religion
 kya dharm kaa anadar kar yaa abhivyakti kii seemaa tay kar
 Have we failed to create a place of criticism for religion

 In the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, an Indian citizen, the day of December 25 is very important because Pakistan gave an opportunity to meet Kulbhushan who is in jail here to meet his mother and wife
 pakistan ne 21 maheene pehle purv bhartiya sainik jadhav ko march, 2016 main achaanak iran kii seemaa se uthaaya or phir jail main band kar diya
 Later he was also sentenced to death

 First Maneuver: Pakistan's first maneuver in the Jadhav case took place on March 3, 2016 when it arrested an Indian citizen Jadhav on the Iran border on charges of conspiracy and spying
 haalanki, bharat kaa daawa he ki iran border se jadhav kaa apharan kiya gaya tha
 Second maneuver: The Pakistan Army claimed 3 weeks later on March 24 that Jadhav was an agent of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and was captured near Sarawan, south-east of Zahidan, near the pak-iran border
 teesraa pintarahusi saal 26 march ko pakistan ne bhartiya duutavas ko saman jari karte hue yah aarope lagaaya ki ro se jude is adhikari kii pakistan main gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se entry karai gai or vah baad main baluchistan tathaa karachi main hue vidhwanskaari gatividhiyon main shaamil rahaa
 India denied this and stated that it no longer had any link with the government
 vah 2002 main sena se ritair ho gaye the
 "fourth Maneuver: On 29 March, Pakistan released a video in its explanation showing Jadhav apologizing
 jadhav yah kehete dikhe ki vah bhartiya sena main ek adhikari hai or ro ke liye kaam karte hai
 India immediately denied it and alleged that the video had been tampered with
 paanchvaan pintaraprail, 2016 main pakistan ke baluchistan kii prantiy sarkaar ne jadhav par aatank failaane or todphod kii sajeesh rachane ke khilaaf exiaar darj karaayaa
 The sixth maneuver: Pakistan (december 7, 2016) again took a new stand in the Jadhav case
 ab pakistan ke pradhanmantri ke videsh maamalon ke salaahkaar sartaaj ajij ne daawa kiya ki jadhav par die gaye saboot paryaapt nahin hai
 The dossier provided on Jadhav is just a statement
 saatvaan pintrah31 disambar, 2016 ko pakistan ne kaha ki vah bhartiya naagarik jadhav se judaa ek doshier yuan sachiv general antonio guteras ko saunpega
 At the same time, Pakistan also gave evidence of Indian attempt to break the cross-border rules
 aathvaan pintarajadhav kii giraftaar ke thik ek saal baad pakistan ke pradhanmantri ke videsh maamalon ke salaahkaar sartaaj ajij jadhav par mili aparyaapt saboot ke apane pehle vaale bayaan se palat gaye
 Aziz claimed that the Pakistan Senate would not hand over Jadhav to India under any circumstances
 bharat ne is bayaan ko gambhirtha se liya or kaha ki use videshi nagarikon ko giraftaar karne ke maamle main antarrashtriya maamalon main jari paramparaon kaa khyaal rakhe
 Ninth maneuver: On April 10, 2017, the local military court in Pakistan announced the execution of Jadhav after hearing the case that lasted for three and a half months
 sainya adaalat ne unhen jasusi karne or aatanki gatividhiyon main shaamil hone kaa doshi paaya
 10th maneuver: Indian authorities claim that Pakistan used a disputed law to convict Jadhav and sentenced him to death
 2 saal pehle kiye gaye sanshodhit sainya niyam ke tahat aam nagarikon par aatankwaad failaane ke maamle main cese sainya adaalat main chalaaya ja saktaa he
 11th maneuver: Pak defense minister Khwaja Asif said that Jadhav has 60 days to appeal against the death penalty
 ham is maamle par niyam ke anusaar chalenge
 12th maneuver: Meanwhile in April 2017, there was news of the disappearance of a former Pakistan military officer from Nepal, in which Pakistan feared that India was behind it
 13waan pintrah15 may ko antarrashtriya court ne sunwaayee ke baad bharat kii apil par jadhav ke faansee kii sajaa ko turant nilambit karne aadesh diya
 It also said that as long as the matter is in court, the convict cannot be hanged
 agar aisa kiya gaya ki ise vienna samjhaute kaa ulanghan mana jayega
 Pakistan described India's effort as a 'political drama'
 14waan pintaraintarrashtriya court ke faisle ke baad paak ne kaha ki is faisle se uske nirnay par koi asar nahin padegaa
 15th maneuver: On 29 May, Pakistan again claimed that it had many proofs that Jadhav is an active detective and involved in terrorist activities in Pakistan
 16waan pintrah31 may ko bharat kii tarah pakistan ke kuch adhikari jadhav maamle main aage kii sunwaayee ke liye 8 june ko hegg main antarrashtriya court main mili
 And put his side in the case

 19waan pintrah13 july ko paak ke videsh adhikari ne kaha ki sarkaar jadhav kii maa ke vija ke anurodh par vichaar kar rahaa he
 20th maneuver: After eating a case in international court for the last time, Pakistan selected one of its former chief justice to present his case in the international court for the case
 21waan pintarapakistan ne 10 november ko maanavtaa ke aadhaar par jadhav ko uski patni se milane dene kii baat kahi
 Pakistan's side said that the government decided to allow Jadhav to meet his wife in Pakistan on humanitarian grounds
 19 november ko bharat ne sweekaar kiya ki unhen aisa patr mila he
 On 8 December, Pak granted 25 December to meet Jadhav's family

 com / or7tf8i8pn i am thankful for the opportunity to serve the people of Bihar
 itihaaskaar bharose ke saath kehete hai ki pracheen bharat kaa gauravshaalee itihaas pracheen bihar kaa itihaas he
 By the way, it is common knowledge today that Bihar is the poorest state in India and if it is compared separately to its size, it is the poorest state in the world
 kya yahi sab kuch he? main aisa nahin sochataa
 i believe that Bihar is a state with great potential in the country and the story of developed India is not possible without the story of developed Bihar
 main ise yatharth main badalane ke liye kaam karata rahaa hum, karata rahoonga
 Bihar's potential can also be underscored by a very simple analysis of the strength, weakness, opportunities and challenges of its progress
 bihar kii takat iske logon main- khaaskar yahaan kii mahilaon, yahaan ke naujavaanon, isaki upjau zamin, iske prachur jal sroton, hazaron varshon kii isaki samrudh viraasat or badi tezi se fail rahe bahu kushal anivaasee bihariyon main he
 At the same time, Bihar also has many weak frontages
 bihar buniyadi dhaanche or sansthaanon ke vikaas main baaki desh se peeche chhot gaya, jo bharat ke duusare samrudh or behatar viksit rajyon kaa maamla nahin he
 Lack of infrastructure and institutions has led to a major shortage in knowledge creation
 iske alaava, bihar chaaron taraf se zamin se ghira he
 After Jharkhand was separated from Bihar, Bihar was also left with natural resources
 to kuch antarnihit kamazoriyaan hai jinase rajya ko jujhna he
 However, the future is bright
 bihar kii majbooti koi usase chin nahin saktaa, jabaki uski kamazoriyaan dur karne ke liye vyavasthaagat dhang se kaam kiya ja saktaa he
 Most opportunities remain at this point
 kisi bhi duusare rajya ko sushasan or niti nirmaan se utana faaydaa nahin ho saktaa, jitna bihar ko
 It is the responsibility of the Central Government to remove the growing macroeconomics within the country through supportive policy formulation
 vishesh rajya kaa darja aisa hi nitigat kadam he
 The state's economy will gain momentum by investing in road, rail, electricity, education and health to achieve the level of infrastructure in Bihar
 netritv or shashan yah sunishchit karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaayenge ki bihar ko uskaa prapya mili or zaruri aadharbhoot or sansthagat vikaas hasil karne ke liye pariyojnaon ko vaqt par puraa kiya jaae
 Today, with the help of technology, Bihar can fill many stages of development simultaneously
 digital kshamta se las bihar kifayati tareeqe se behatar str kii shiksha, swasthya suvidhaayen or saamaajik kalyaan muhaiyaa kara saktaa he
 Improving the basic infrastructure of the state, better education and training of youth, proper law and order and availability of power will lay the much needed foundation for investment and entrepreneurship
 yahaan se bainkon se milane vaala karz nijee kshetra ke vikaas ko badhaava dene main kaaphi ahm bhoomika nibhaayega
 In this frame, wherever you look, investment has a role - whether it is in infrastructure development, in promoting the skills and knowledge of youth, or in enabling investment and entrepreneurship
 bihar main nivesh kaa maamla saral he or yah niveshkon, rajya or samaaj ko bilkul samaybaddh phayda degaa
 Apart from this, work should also be done on the farming blueprint, which has been drawn by the state to take India towards the second green revolution, which i often imagine as a rainbow revolution
 bihar chote kisaanon kaa rajya he jinke paas desh kii sabase upjau bhoomi he
 The blueprint for farming clearly creates a policy approach that can make farming more productive and productive
 shaharikaran vah ek or ahm kshetra he jahaan bihar main avasar hi avasar hai
 Today, only one out of nine people of Bihar live in an urban area
 ise swaabhaavik dhang se badhanaa he or agle das saal main kam se kam duguna ho janaa he
 The state can take advantage of this Surat, simply by ensuring that Bihar's urban centers are better employed, have electricity and become the anchor of employment generation
 aadhunik takanic ke saath, ise kahin behatar raftaar or sunishchit parinaamon ke saath hasil kiya ja saktaa he
 An important opportunity for Bihar is the large base of non-resident people of the state, who have various skills and many resources
 rajya se unka judaav sirf sampatti or unke vistrut parivaar tak hi simit nahin he jo rajya main rah rahaa he, balki yah ek gaharaa bhaavnaatmak judaav he or unako bihar ke vikaas ke liye kaam karne ko prerit karata he
 i see this as a very big possibility that the knowledge, resources and aspirations of nris can be diverted towards the issue of development of the state
 mujhe un khataron kaa bhi puraa-puraa ehsaas he jo bihar lagaataar jhel rahaa he
 One, the state has been hit by natural disasters - particularly floods and famines
 pehle se hi badha hua ye khatra jalwaayu parivartan ko dekhte hue or bada ho saktaa he
 Secondly, caste and religion play an important role in our very densely populated and poor state
 isliye bihar anyaay, niskriyata or vibhaajak takaton kaa bhi aasaan shikaar he
 While the risks of natural calamity can be reduced by active governance, the only way to make the state tolerant on the social front is the approach of development with justice
 bihar kii sarkaar aisi honi chahie jo vikaas kar sake, uske phaaydon ko sabase kamazor tabakon tak pahunchaa sake, or saamaajik samarasata ko lagaataar majboot kar sake
 Nowhere in the world has the policy and politics of a poor state divided
 to bihar ke aage badhane kaa iklauta rasta majboot netritv, sushasan or nyaay ke saath vikaas he
 This simple analysis of the state's strengths, weaknesses, its opportunities and dangers also puts forth the wild possibilities of the state
 meffi kalpana is sambhaavna ko moort rup dene kii he
 The strengths will have to be fully utilized - the youth have to acquire the skills to move forward and contribute, women will have to play their proper role in the society
 hamaari zamin kii utpaadakta badhaani hogi, jal sansadhano ke istemaal ko utpaadak bananaa hoga or duniya bhar ke logon ko apni samrudh saanskrithik viraasat kaa athubhav karana hoga
 Weaknesses have to be reduced
 iske liye chaahe jo bhi karnaa pade
 Bihar has to achieve parity in terms of infrastructure, institutions and knowledge
 yah rajya or centre sarkaar kii zimmedaari he
 Often people talk about missed opportunities in Bihar
 ab or nahin
 My vision is to develop an approach whereby Bihar will fully utilize its opportunities
 hamaare noujvaan ladke-ladkiyaan- or ve karodon main hai- behatar prashikshit honge or kisi bhi duusare rajya ke logon se sakasham honge
 Our cities and cities will provide better living standards and employment opportunities
 or rajya udhyamiyon or niveshkon ke hub ke rup main viksit hoga
 Also, our villages will be self-sufficient and vibrant
 is baar bihar duusari harith kranti main sirf shaamil nahin hoga, balki uskaa netritv karegaa
 Where i am working towards these goals, i should also clear the most important message for the people
 main ek aisa rajya banane main lagunga jo hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye kushasan kii kahani kii chaaya se mukt ho jaae
 The thought and fear that Bihar may ever return to irresponsible rule and law and order should be away from the hearts and minds of the people
 meri mul takat sushasan, samgr vikaas or saamaajik samarasata dene kii kshamta he
 As i have tried in the last nine years, my desire is to create a state where it becomes firmly institutionalized
 or main ye koshish hameshaa hameshaa jari rakhte hue, aisa rajya bananaa chahta hum jo sakaaratmak bhavishya, jeevant samskruti or tikaoo samarasata kii daastaan ko bharose ke saath aage le ja sake
 And in achieving this, i will work with the Government of India and the Hon'ble Prime Minister with due diligence in favor of Bihar
 varsh 1971 se lekar 2011 tak chaar dashakon main desh main hinduon kii aabaadi doguni se bhi adhik hokar 96 karod 62 lakh se zyada ho gai he haalanki kul jansankhya main unki bhagidaari takreeban teen fisadi kam hui he

 Withdrawing support from the Gujral government, was it a mistake by the Congress? In the elections held after the Gujral government, the former NDA government president Pranab Mukherjee believed that the Congress has taken a backseat by withdrawing support from the Gujral government
 pranav mukherjee ne purv pradhanmantri indra kumaar gujral kii 100veen jayanti par yojit kaarykram main buudhvaar ko dilli main bolte hue kaha ki congress ne agar 1997 main gujral sarkaar se samarthan waapas nahin liya hota to shaayad 1998 main bijepi ko satta main aane se roak sakate the
 This means that the Congress withdrew support from the Gujral government and gave the BJP a chance to come to power
 pranav mukherjee ne kaha ki1998 main bijepi ko satta main aane se shaayad roak saktethe
 The Gujarat government could complete its tenure with the support of our (congress)
 unhone kaha ki gujral kii jab seetaram kesari se baatcheet chal rahi thi
 Then i was also there
 unhone kaha ki jab (rajeev gandhi) hatyakand se diemke kaa koi spasht sambandh sthapit nahin hua to unhen gathbandhan sarkaar se baahar kyon kiya jaae?gujral 1997 main bane the piempurv raashtrapati ne kaha ki iske baavjood unhone apni sarkaar kaa bhi khatra uthaa liya
 The Congress withdrew support from the Gujral government
 iske baad agle march main kya hua ye sab jaanate hai
 The BJP won more than 180 seats and got a chance to come to power
 1998 main endie kii sarkaar bani
 During this, Pranab Mukherjee also praised Indra Kumar Gujral's foreign policy
 baat den ki purv piem indra kumaar gujral 21 april 1997 se lekar 19 march 1998 tak desh ke pradhanmantri rahe the
 Gujral passed away on 30 November 2012 at the age of 92
 mukherjee ne apni kitaab main kiya he zikrpurv raashtrapati pranav mukherjee ne apni kitaab'colision iers: 1996--2012' main bhi gujral sarkaarase samarthan waapas lene ke prakaran kaa ullekh kiya he
 He has written in the book that in 1997, the then Congress President Sitaram Kesari had toppled Gujral's government for his ambition to become Prime Minister
 mukherjee ne likhaa he ki congress ne rajeev gandhi kii hatya kii jaanch karne vaale jain ayog kii antarim report ke baad gujral sarkaar se samarthan waapas lene kii maang kii
 The Jain Commission report stated that the DMK and its leadership were involved in promoting LTTE chief v Prabhakaran and his supporters
 jabaki sajeesh main kisi netaa yaa kisi raajnneetik dal ke shaamil hone kii baat nahin kahi gai thi
 The Congress was supporting the Gujral government from outside
 diemke ke bahaane gujral sarkaar se liya samarthanmukherjee ne likhaa he ki 1997 main sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr ke dauraan is sankat ko dur karne ke prayaas main kai baithken hui thim
 Congress leaders, including Sitaram Kesari, Pranab Mukherjee, Jitendra Prasad, Arjun Singh and Sharad Pawar, were invited by then Prime Minister Inder Gujral to dinner at his residence
 is dauraan gujral ne kaha ki diemke ke kisi netaa ke isamen shaamil hone kaa sidhaa pramaan nahin
 In such a situation, action against DMK will send a wrong message and at the same time the government will be considered to be working under pressure from one party
 mukherjee ne likhaa ki hamane gujral se kaha ki unki baat ko congress kaarysmiti main rakhenge or cameti is par antim faisla legi
 Most of the Congress members were not in favor of getting support from the government
 iske baavjood cameti ne sarkaar se samarthan waapas lene kaa prastaav paarit kar diya
 After this, the next year the Lok Sabha elections were held, BJP won more than 180 seats and NDA government was formed

 An extensive, high-powered network of universities is a must for any country aspiring to become an economic power
 khud ko gnanadhaarit arthvyavastha bataane vaale bharat ke liye is tarah kaa network to or bhi adhik jaruri he
 There is evidence that the country still lacks a world-class university system
 isamen sudhaar kaa ek tarika pratispardhaa he
 The performance of companies can be judged on the basis of changing figures like revenue and profits, but the relative success of educational institutions is more difficult to measure
 duusare saal main chal rahi desh ke pramukh vishvavidhyalayon kii india today-nilsan ranking, post-graduate shiksha sansthaaon ke saapeksh staron ko aankane kaa ek prayaas he
 Like all such rankings, it also involves subjectivity, due to which some people will be happier than others
 2010 ke paanch sarvshereshth vishvavidhyalayon kii sthiti 2011 main bhi vahi he
 There has been only one change and that Delhi University, which finished in third place last year, has moved to the first place and BHU has moved up to third place this time, beating the Banaras Hindu Vishwa Vidyalaya (BHU)
 jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay, kalakatta vishvavidhyalay or madras vishvavidhyalay kramshah duusare, chauthe or paanchaven sthaan par hi bane hue hai
 The next five places from 6 to 10 have undergone much change because the University of Mumbai, Bangalore-based Indian Institute of Science and Jadavpur University, which were ranked sixth, eighth and ninth respectively, did not participate in the survey this year
 unke saath kuch majaburiyaan thim jinaki vajah se ve prakaashan kii antim tithi tak jaruri aankade nahin bhej sake
 We hope to participate in the survey next year
 hyderabad vishvavidhyalay or osmania vishvavidhyalay pichley saal saatven or dasven sthaan par the, lekin is baar ve upar uthakar kramshah chathe or saatven sthaan par pahunch gaye
 It is a matter of concern for India from the global point of view that even the best universities of the country are considered secondary compared to their own counterparts in other countries
 antarrashtriya vishvavidhyalay ranking main sarvocch str kii samajhi jaati landan sthit times hair ajukeshan (tiechai) ranking ne 2010 main asia ke 27 vishvavidhyalayon ko duniya ke sarvshereshth 200 vishvavidhyalayon main rakhaa tha
 Not a single university was from India
 unamem se chah china ke hai, jisane apane zyada udyogikrut pratispardhiyon-kramshah 4 or 5 vishvavidhyalayon vaale japan or korea-ko peeche chhod diya he
 In another prestigious international ranking done by global education network QS, India Today's best-ranked Delhi University has been ranked 371st in the world in 2010-11
 mumbai vishvavidhyalay ko 451-500 ranking ke bich sthaan mila he jabaki kalakatta vishvavidhyalay 500-551 ke bich sthit he
 There are no Indian universities except five iits in qs's Asia's Top 50 list
 asia main dilli vishwa-vidhyalay 77wein, kalakatta vishvavidhyalay 116wein, pune vishvavidhyalay 142wein or mumbai vishvavidhyalay 145wein sthaan par he
 Except for iits, India has not built enough such institutions that can compete with the best universities in Asia
 bharat main centre sarkaar ke vishvavidhyalay anudaan ayog (ujisi) se manyata praapt kul 538 vishvavidhyalay hai
 The problem is that after the best 45 universities the level of the remaining 493 disappears rapidly
 yahaan tak ki sarvshereshth 45 main bhi sarvshereshth 15 or baaki ke bich gunvattta main khaasaa antar he
 Many people are miffed about the rise of India as the next knowledge-based superpower
 bharat main aksar yah maan liya jaataa he ki china sefti pin se lekar microchip tak har cheez kaa nirmaan karke jahaan duniya kaa kaarkaana bana rahegaa, vahiin bharat dimagi takat muhaiyaa karaayega
 But the way Chinese universities are regularly outpacing their Indian counterparts in the global rankings, it is too early to say that India will have an edge over China in terms of knowledge
 isi tarah america ko patansheel vaishvik shakti ke rup main khaarij karnaa jaldbaaji hogi, jisaki jagah antat china le legaa
 Most of the top 20 universities in most rankings are almost all Americans
 britain ke oxford or cambridge vishvavidhyalayon ne us suchi main jagah banaakar mahaj america ke ekadhikaar ko tod rakhaa he
 If China and India ultimately want to beat the US, they will have to build universities that can attract the best academic talent from America
 usee tarah jaise america ne 20veen sadi main britain se pratibhaaon ko aakarshith kiya tha
 What is the main obstacle in the path of upliftment of Indian universities? Government
 yah hakeekat he ki sarvshereshth vishvavidhyalayon ko sarkaar chalaa rahi he
 But because it kept universities out of the reach of the private sector for a long time
 or antat jab usne nijee vishvavidhyalayon kii ijaajat di to yah pakkaa nahin kiya ki unka str banaae rakhaa jaae
 The necessary legislation for change is hanging because instead of running the government, the UPA is spending its energy in dealing with scams

 The private sector has shown that if it gets a chance, it can live up to the scale

 It ranks 14th on our list

 Like our higher education system, this ranking is also improving
