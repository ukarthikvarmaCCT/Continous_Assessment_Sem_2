 Govinda's letter has been written about 'aa Gaya Hero'
 is par daancing star bura maananaa chahen to maan len
 But please take a look at our point
 
 
 priy govinda ji,aapako is tarah se dobaaraa aane kii bilkul bhi jarurat nahin thi, jis tarah se aap aae he
 As soon as your name comes, that 'hero' comes in our mind with whom we used to laugh and whose cry we used to moisten our eyes
 bombai hoicourt ne di govinda ko badi raahat, agrim jamaanat milisal 1986 main ai aapaki film 'lav 86' kaa viki ho yaa 'khudgarj' kaa kumaar saxena
 Or we, eyes and respect may not be victorious, we have lived all those characters as spectators
 saath hi film 'swarg' kekrishna bhaiyako apana bhai mana he
 We have seen every character in the 'number-1' series by your name and even today entertainment gets doubled
 raja babu kaa kirdaar to abhi likhte hue bhi jahan main gum rahaa he
 Even your film partners, kill-dil and Happy Ending, have been seen to blossom due to your presence, but why 'aa Gaya Hero'? There was no need for this film
 govinda ne karan ko bataaya khatarnaak, varun dhawan par bhi ksaa tanjaap aaj se nahin, saal 1986 se hi aae hue hai or aap hamaare usee str ke hero rahe hai
 We were not at all happy to see your film 'aa Gaya Hero' and every moment we were just asking ourselves that why did you do this film with so much money in 2017? Every reality show, whether it Be it Bigg Boss, Dance Show, Singing Show or Comedy Show, you promoted the film on every stage and believe that those promotions were many times better than the film because during the promotion you looked like yourself
 ham ek baat or kahana chahenge ki puure pramotion ke dauraan aapane apni vyathaa industry ke saamne rakhi, karan johar se lekar david dhawan or varun dhawan tak ko bhala bura sunaaya, jisaki koi aavashyaktaa nahin thi
 Today we are really sad
 govinda ne dilli main kholaa 'hero number 1' restaurantaham bas yahi kahana chaahate hai ki aap ek aise actor hai jiskaa naam aate hi hamaare bheetar ek alag tarah kaa utsaah or romaanch aa jaataa he or yakeen maaniye aap screen par behatar kahaniyon ke saath judiye, kyonki behatar kahani aapaki maujuudagi se blockbster ban jaaegi
 Even today Ranveer Singh is keeping your photo as his display picture, while we fans stick to the TV with the whole family when your movies come
 aap har film se judiye, har ek tarah ke yuva yaa hamaumr actors ke saath kaam kiijie or haa uuparavaale se kaamana he ki hamaara hero jaisaa tha, vaisaa hi rahe, use baar-baar 'aa gaya hero' kehane kii jarurat naa pade
 In the end you would like to say in your own style, 'stay healthy, be cool, be busy'

 unhone mallika ko haath pakad uthaaya or bina kuch bole us neerav mandir main le gaye
 The fractal pillars of the temple were telling the story of the loot of the invaders
 dhaatu-murtiyon gaayab thim
 But someone had set up a blind god whose eyes were made of shells
 neeche ek buja deepak tha or kuch mlaan pushp
 a herd of ants was being dragged by Prasad's misri
 sookhe hue chandan paatr or buji agarbattiyon kii ek mahak vahaan ek alokik vatavaran rach thi
 The Jew took Mallika in front of her by holding her shoulders and put a jasmine garland without saying anything to Mallika's eyes - in this temple, set in the lap of two juggling banyans
 "malli, agar tum yah anubhav karti ho ki paane-khone, milane-na milane se pare he yah anany prem! durbhaagya-saubhaahgya donon hi tuchh hai is prem ke saamne
 If you have found your unique lover in me, then put this garland on me
 na pahana sako to ise apane juude main band lenaa
 i respect the garland i have given you that you are the best and the only woman in the world whom i have loved
 ek ekanishthata aatma kii bhi hoti he priy
 It is not possible for the soul to deflect from that
 ”mallika ke netra chhalak gaye
 
 
 In the ribs, the throbbing mind blossomed like Sahasrakamal
 kya yah vyakti man padhata he? mallika ne apni maral greeva jhukaa kar apane priyatam ko varan liya
 
 chalate-chalate donon gangatat kii ret par aa gayi
 Jatamansi had grown for the last few days
 is dheer-samir ghat par is mangalik avasar par koi bhi upasthit nahin tha
 Giant turtles were just lying in the shade of jatamansi vines and pink flowers
 upar tarikaon se ghiri niharika muskura rahi thi
 Mallika kept thinking while looking at Jew in those starlight
 “kya hua jo main aaj tum par bhar-bhar anjuriyaan mandaar pushp na barasaa saki, tumhen to in sookhe belapatron se riz janaa chahie tha
 There is a huge difference between you and me! You have the ability to spread a full cup, i am that, satisfied droplet for drop by drop

 afghanistan main ravivaar ko ek suraksha checknake par kiye gaye aatankwaadi hamale main 21 log maare gaye
 An official gave this information
 samachar agency sinhua ke anusaar adhikariyon ne bataaya, 'aatankwaadiyon ke ek dal ne gazani shahar main tadake teen baje ek police checknake par dhaava bol diya
 'the officer said that 18 militants and three policemen were killed in the encounter
 hamalavar aatankwaadiyon ne chaar pulicekarmiyon ko agava kar liya
 The Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attack and kidnapping
 tubalite ke flop hone ke baad se salmaan khan kii image par kaaphi asar padaa he
 Even Sallu Bhai had to compensate the loss due to distributors due to the film being a flop
 magar ab lagata he ki is bharpai ko salmaan ne duusare tareeke se puraa karne kaa soch liya he
 According to a report, Salman has demanded 70 percent of the profits of his upcoming film Race-3
 salmaan khan cobox offis kaa sultansamajha jaataa he
 But when the tubelight flopped, his credibility got a shock
 ise bachaane ke liye unhone distributors kii maang par unhen nuksaan kaa hissaa bhi lautaaya
 Now Sallu Bhai is preparing for his upcoming films
 inamen res-3 bhi ek film he
 If you believe a report published in Deccan Chronicle, then it is being said that Salman Khan has asked the filmmakers to take 70 percent of the profits from this film
 50 pratishat hissaa pehle bhi lete rahe hai sitarevaise to yah koi nai baat nahin he ki film actor yaa actresses ne film ke profit main hissaa maanga ho
 Even before this, up to 50 percent profit has been shared
 kai baar ye kalakaar film sebataur prodeusrabhi jude hote hai
 However, now that Aamir Khan is going to be a film distributor too, it seems that all the top stars want their share in film distribution too
 trade jaankaron kii maane, to agar film achche paise kamaati he, to film se jude sitare iskaa share bhi lenaa chaahate hai
 There is nothing wrong in this, though according to the report about Race-3, 70 percent share is quite high
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki film ke producers is par kya jawaab dete hai
 John had signed on the condition of not being in the film, let us tell that Salman Khan will be in negative role in Race-3
 film kaa nirdeshnaramo disuja karenge
 Jacqueline Fernandes will also be seen in an important role in this film
 iske liye baaki actress kii khoj jari he
 Among them, names like Bipasha Basu and Daisy Shah are leading the way
 vaise ye bhi bataa den ki salmaan khan is film se judane ke liye tabhi raji hue the, jab yah tay ho gaya tha ki jon abraham is film kaa hissaa nahin honge
 John was in a pivotal role in Race-2
 haalanki is samay salmaan apni film tiger zindaa he kaa aakhri bhaag shoot kar rahe hai, jiske khatm hote hi wo agle maheene res 3 kii shooting shuru kar denge

 India Today Group: It is a matter of bravery to write a book while you are CEO, that is, in the fog of war
 aam taur par siio apni kamyaabiyon kaa intjaar karte hai or phir varshon baad uske bare main baat karte hai
 Why did you decide to write this book now? Satya Nadella: It is done, it did not inspire him to write a book to try to make a statement or to talk about the future, but to talk about the process of change Is for kyonki mujhe ehsaas hua ki kisi bhi sandarbh main agua hone ke naate aap jo karte hai—or jindagi jite hue bhi aap jo karte hai—uskaa vaasta badlaav se he
 i felt that going through it, thinking about it is to lighten the mind and clear things by saying my feelings
 yah sabaki najaron ke saamne 'peeche dekhnaa' bhar nahin he
 One of its inspirations was when i met Steve (balmer, Nadella's predecessor) about six months after leaving his company
 maine unase poocha, ''kya aap kitaab likh rahe hai?'' unhone shandaar jawaab diya, ''nahin, ateet main peeche mudakar dekhnaa bahut ubaau he
 "and then i blinked - right now, when i am in the middle of it all
" kisi bhi tarah se main yah nahin kah rahaa hum ki safar puraa hua, badlaav khatm ho chukaa he yaa kamyaabi mil gai he
 But i thought let's consider my journey to Microsoft, the moments of change and then our society
 yahi teen baaten hai jo asal main isaki prerana thim
 India Today Group: You talk about the soul of Microsoft and ask existential questions in the book
 kya aisa karnaa kuch-kuch hindustani cheez nahin he?satya nadelajahan tak yah aatma ke khyaal kii baat he, main jab companiyon ke bare main sochataa hum, to ranneeti kii bahut baat kii jaati he, or jaahir he, vah sabase ahm he
 Technology is talked about a lot, of course, it is also very important
 aapke paas sahi vakt par sahi technology honi chahie, or phir aapako apni ranneeti or amal se use jaahir karnaa hota he
 But what is not emphasized by these two ends of long-term, real competitive advantage is the realization of purpose, identity and culture
 jab main peeche mudakar dekhtaa hum, to ham 40 se zyada varshon se behad kaamyaab company hai
 And whenever we could get things right on those two ends, we achieved great success
 jab hamane aisi chijen kin jo us makasad ke ehsaas par tiki hui nahin thim, jo chaaron taraf najar daudati thim or kahati thim ki ''are, baaki koun kya kar rahaa he?'' yaa yahaan tak ki ishrya kaa ehsaas tha, tab yah kaamyaab nahin hua
 So this is the reason why talking about the original soul and finding it afresh has been a big part of what we did, at least in the early stages
 india today grupah aap astitvvaadi sawaal poochhate hai ki microsoft kaa astitv kyon hona chahie or ise ve chijen kyon kerani chahie jo vah kar rahi he
 What answers do you get? Satya Nadella: When Bill (gates) and Paul (ellen) started the company, the first product Microsoft produced was the first interpreter for Altair
 microsoft kii us bilkul shuruyaat ke vakt isane har us cheez ko paribhaashit kiya jo hamane kiya he or har us cheez ko jo ham aage badhate hue karenge—jo yah he ki hamane technology banaai taaki duusare or zyada technology taiyaar kar saken
 This is us kabhi-kabhi log mujhase poochhate hai, ''kya aap upabhokta company hai? kya aap udhyam company hai?'' ham donon hi nahin hai
 We are a company that manufactures technology so that others can produce more technology
 mere mutabik, yahi ham hanru ham samarth banaate hai
 We say that our mission is to enable every person and every organization in the world to get more
 inamen se har lafj ke hamaare liye gahare arth hai kyonki ham logon ke bare main or logon kii sansthaaon ke bare main sochate hai
 We cannot just celebrate our technology
 khud apni technology gande main dusron kii kamyaabi kaa jashn manaanaa hota he
 This is the identity of Microsoft
 india today grupah jab aap khud se poochhate hai ki aap jo karte hai vah kyon karte hai, to kya jawaab miltaa he?satya nadelahjab meri umr kareeb 30 varsh thi, ek behad taqatvar lakwaha aayaa
 At the time i was working with Doug Bergam, who is currently the governor of North Dakota
 or unhone mujhase kuch aisa kaha jisane is bare main meraa najariya puri tarah badal diya ki main jo karata hum, uske bare main main kaise sochataa hum
 He said, "look, you're finally going to spend more time at work (in my case, the more time i spend with my kids, maybe more at Microsoft), the better it will be
" yah aisa nahin ho saktaa ki tum isliye kuch karte ho kyonki yah koi lenden vaali cheez he
 "and when i look back, my most satisfying time in all my time was not about any particular technology or product or business process, but what we did or what i did around me, This was due to its effect
 or apane nijee jazbe or falsafe se takat hasil karne kii kaabiliyat or is lambey-chaude plateform ko lenaa jo microsoft taiyaar karata he, or in donon ko aapas main jod dena, yah shandaar he
 We may never be able to do it right, in fact despair is part of life, part of any context, but at least that is the ideal
 yahi vah cheez he jo mujhe chalaati rahati he
 India Today Group: When you started, did you ever think that you would be part of a group of people who are changing the world? Satya Nadella: What i thought was deeply ingrained in me was a sense of curiosity
 chizon ko, maukon ko dekhne kii kaabiliyat or yah maananaa ki yah shandaar he
 i don't remember any work at Microsoft that i got and i thought, "oh my God, this job is less important than what i had before
" '' mujhe hameshaa yahi laga ki yah sabase shandaar kaam he, yah sabase shandaar mauka he, main ise paakar kitna romanchit hum
 This is some mail from my father, my mother and their effect on me, which was a strange match
 lekin isane kuch aisa rachaa ki jahaan aisi koi cheez nahin thi ki ''oh, kisi agali cheez ke liye dekho''
 The opposite was to "accept what you have got and really, really take full advantage of it, so that it will have a deep impact
" '' kisi bhi duusari cheez se zyada shaayad isi baat ne mujhe vah banaaya he jo main hum
 India Today Group: With what you know today, if you talk to Nadella a few years back, what will you say? Satya Nadella: If i have to come back, i will apply that which i now understand better
 kyonki itani badi jindagi kisi na kisi cheez kii ummid main ji jaati he
 This is a stereotypical thing, but it is the most powerful, that you have to be able to live that moment intelligently because that is what you have got
 yah samajhane main mushkil he
 But perhaps this is what has made the most difference to me
 india today grupah aapaki kitaab kii bhoomika main bill gates is vakt digital kranti kii shuruyaat hone kii baat karte hai
 It is surprising
 kya ham is kranti ke adhabich main nahin he or kya iske shikhar kii taraf nahin bad rahe hai?satya nadelahyah dilachasp he
 i read a lot about these huge changes in human history
 jahiraa taur par bada badlaav audyogic kranti thi kyonki yah sochakar adbhut lagata he ki audyogic kranti ne kya kuch kiya
 By 1750, the world's GDP was the same in many parts (if you omit parts of the world), especially in Asia, most of Europe
 prati vyakti aamadani or jivan kii gunvattta ke lihaaj se utani zyada gairbarabari nahin thi jitani ab he
 And then the Industrial Revolution changed it completely
 robert je
 Gordon has a wonderful book (the Rise and Fall of American Growth: The US Standard of Living Sins the Civil War) that talks about the rise and fall of American productivity
 misaal ke liye, ve kehete hai ki 1870 main agar aap manahaton main paidal gum rahe hote, to sabase zyada sambhaavna isaki hoti ki aapke juuton par ghode kii lid hoti
 Whereas if you go in 1940, you and i can enter and feel that yes, we have no social media and no television, but we have water, hot water, plumbing, cars, air conditioning, Everything is something that we are accustomed to and it will look amazing
 or 70 saal kii miyaad main thik yahi hua he
 And so i say in a way, wow, how much is it in the fourth industrial revolution, which is the digital revolution? Gordon himself also talks about the benefits of productivity that are apparently the most fundamental in economic growth, which are fundamental to the benefit of society as a whole
 1990 ke dashak ke bich se lekar 2000 ke dashak ke bich tak aisa hua tha or isamen se bahut kuch kaa shrey asal main kaam karne kii jagahon main personal computer ke aagaman ko diya jaataa he
 Since then we have become so much a consumer hanger — i would say, a hanger of consumption — that we have not achieved the level of economic prosperity that could have been more evenly divided because of digital technology
 isliye is nazariye se main sochataa hum ki hamen or zyada technology kii, or us technology ke zyada vyapak asar kii jarurat he
 India Today Group: So what are the next big things in technology that will give it strength? Satya Nadella: There are at least three big things
 ek haih technology ko aisa kaise banaaya ja saktaa he ki hamamen se or zyada logon ko yah zyada kudarti dhang se sulabh ho? nirnaayak vah hoga jab computer aapaki ankhon ke aage hoga or aap asal duniya or virtual yaa abhaasi duniya main fark tak nahin kar rahe honge
 This is what we call mixed reality world
 to yah buniyadi sthanantaran or badlaav kaa ek pahalu he
 The second aspect is intelligence, machine intelligence or artificial intelligence
 main jis ek buniyadi cheez kii bahut zyada baat karata hum, vah computing or technology kii is bharmaar main ab bhi bahut durlabh or anuthi he, or vah he insaan kaa dhyaan
 The only relief in this is something like Artificial Intelligence to help me focus on the things that matter to me and my life and to my organization, to my family
 to isliye artificial intelligence vah doosraa pahalu he jo insaan kii jindagiyon, sanghathanon or kul milakar arthvyavasthaaon par ahm asar daalane ja rahaa he
 And then the last aspect is that if we want to create more of this glut of computing interfaces and experiences, everything that goes with the power of artificial intelligence, you have to compute a lot
 asal main jo clasical computer he, aapako usase bhi aage janaa hoga, moore ke niyam se aage, kyonki us sthapaty se or zyada hasil karne kii hamaari kshamta ke lihaaj se ham bhautikee kii sarhad par pahunch rahe hai
 And this is where i think that something like quantum computing can change it completely
 microsoft main hamaare yahaan ek bahut romaanchak program he, kuch or log bhi is par kaam kar rahe hai
 The basic successes of Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science will have to come together to essentially devise a new form of computing
 india today grupah aapane moore ke niyam se aage jane kaa zikr kiya
 Are there any new rules that you can think of for the advancement of technology? Satya Nadella: If there is a universal rule, one thing i have experienced is that whenever you believe that you have the last device, the last computer, the most universal computer Have discovered, then all you have to do is wait for a while, there will be more computing, no less computing
 meraa samatuly yahi hoga
 India Today Group: So let's call it the 'rule of Truth' (laughter)
 aapane bahut zyada is bare main likhaa he ki technology duniya bhar main logon kii jindagi ko loktantric bana rahi he
 Do you think that we are reaching a stage where we are talking about who is creating and controlling technology? Is it increasing the inequality between different parts of the world? Satya Nadella: Saif, this is one of the big questions that have been arising in my mind
 main hameshaa yah sochakar hairaan hota tha ki jab audyogic kranti chal rahi thi, tab aurangzeb ke darbar main kya ho rahaa tha
 For example, how was the atmosphere there? The key seems to be something: once technology is accessible to you, what do you do with it? In the case of Hindustan, people use this word made up of the first letter, ABCD of India, ie Astrology, Bollywood, Cricket and Philosophy, or whatever you would say that interest of India in a variety of ways to do anything new
 It is in all of them
 aapako isse aage janaa hoga
 You just can't be happy that hey, everyone has a smartphone
 ve kar kya rahe hai? iskaa neeche kii taraf jane vaala nateeja kya he? jab tak sthaneey arthvyavastha ke bheetar bahut lambey-chaide dhang se technology ke istemaal kii tivrata nahin he, tab tak aap digital badhat paidaa nahin kar rahe hai
 Apparently we want profit in every country in which we have a stake, but we also care a lot about what profit is being made due to the use of our technology
 india today grupah hamen kis raste par chalanaa chahie, is lihaaj se ki aise desh honge jo technology kaa istemaal karke apane jidipi ko badhaane main kaamyaab honge?satya nadelahmeri raay main harek desh ke liye, harek desh ke udhyami tabake ke liye, harek desh kii audyogic niti ke liye behad jaruri he ki ve puri arthvyavastha main sabase zyada dhyaan dene vaali praathamikta ke taur par apane agenda ke liye vaaki digital technology kaa istemaal karen
 One of the places where this has happened is, in my opinion, Hindustan
 india stack yah kehane kaa shandaar tarika he ki thik he, chalo digital technology ko lete hai, ise zyada praasangik banaate hai taaki yah zyada sevaaon ko harek hindustani naagarik kii or zyada pahunch main laa sake
 And then reduce transaction costs because this will accelerate economic growth
 misaal ke liye, yah audyogic niti or public sector donon ko gande kaa acha tarika he, ve kaise kaam karte hai or phir hindustan main tamaam udhyamshil gatividhiyon ke jariye jo ho rahaa he, uske saath beshak use jodpha
 But i think it would have to be on a much larger scale
 or kabhi-kabhi main sochataa hum ki chalo ham sangrakshanvaadi ho jaaen, par yah kaam nahin aata, kyonki agar technology tak aapaki pahunch nahin he to sangrakshanvaadi hone kaa sirf yahi matlab he ki aap peeche chhot jaaenge
 So you have to be very, very good so that you can understand what is the secular change that is happening
 isse inkaar kii maansikta main na rahen
 Ensure that it takes up things, then produces higher value results that are relevant in the context of our own economy and then in the wider world
 india today grupah bhartiya ity sector par aaen to yah dabaav main dikhaai detaa he or shaayad ise khud ko nae sire se ijad karnaa pade
 What advice would you give them? Satya Nadella: i will say two things
 kisi bhi alag company ke liye bilkul nae sire se shuruyaat karnaa bahut ahm baat he
 This is not just about capturing the new wave of technology, but also doing it as well as changing your business model
 kai maamalon main yah zyada mushkil hissaa hota he kyonki technology ke badlaav ke hisaab se dhalanaa ek baat he, par bijness model ke badlaavon se nipatna buniyadi taur par kahin zyada mushkil he
 Because your profits change and you really have to handle a variety of things during that
 usee samay saarvajanik bazaaron se ve ijaajaten hasil kar paanaa bahut mushkil jatan ho jaataa he, lekani aapako vah karnaa padataa he
 When i turn and look at Microsoft, in our 45 years — i mean in my own 25 years — the number of threats to our existence has been different
 or asal main, isi tareeke se main ise maapta hum, jo yah he ki harek paanch saal main kisi ko ek kism se mere kaanon main budbudana chahie ki oh, to ek nayaa shaks he jo tumhen khatm karne ja rahaa he
 And if this does not happen to you, then there is something wrong
 lekin kul milakar jab main dekhtaa hum ki hindustan ke sandarbh main kya ho rahaa he, to hakeekat yah he ki technology kii ab zyada bade paimaane par charchaa ho rahi he, chaahe vah aadhaar ke saath saarvajanik kshetra ke apni technology ko apnaane main ho rahaa he, yaa chaahe ve hindustani start-ap hon jo asal main khud hindustan kii arthvyavastha ke liye buniyadi taur par nai chijen ijad kar rahe hai
 And then of course they can also export it, but the Indian economy is digitizing in a unique way, building big companies, that is encouraging
 isliye mere mutabik yah nai technology ko apnaane, iske gahan istemaal karne kii, or munaafe paidaa karne kii baat he
 In my opinion this is to be the next job in Indian IT
 yah zyada gaharaa, zyada vyapak he, desh main udhyamshil urja kaaphi he, desh kii pratibha kamaal kii he
 India Today Group: Where do you see a government, like the Indian government, taking product technology? Where are those opportunities and what should the government do? Satya Nadella: If you, like the public sector or the government, are not using technology to spend taxpayers' money efficiently, then you are not doing well for your citizens Have been
 isliye sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ko sabase chust-durust tareeke se chalaane ke liye technology kaa istemaal pehle number kaa kaam he
 My first advice would be, whether it is in Delhi or in Washington or in London or anywhere
 duusari baat, beshak audyogic niti ke nazariye se, yah jaananaa he ki aapke liye technology ko or technology kii tarakkee ko badhaava dene ke tamaam tareeke kya hai taaki aap har jagah or zyada aarthik vruddhi ko anjaam de saken
 i think this is very important
 mujhe lagata he ki iskaa koi shortkat nahin he or khaas taur par loktantric deshon main aapako kanoonee samaadhaan nikaalane hote hai ki kisi bhi desh main niztaa or suraksha ke bich santulan kya ho, yahi sabase ahm he
 And that's why this technology is the solution to deal with these basic issues with the right legal framework, who understands and believes as well
 aap 21veen sadi main us kanoonee dhaanche kaa istemaal nahin kar sakate jo 20veen sadi ke liye banaaya gaya tha
 This is the basic issue
 main samajhataa hum aaj vibhinn tarah kaa besuraapan isi se paidaa ho rahaa he
 In the context of Hindustan, privacy is a basic right, but if you are not using data to create value for the same Indian citizen, then you are doing evil to that Indian citizen
 to yah sawaal ki donon pakshon ko sakasham kaise banaaen, main samajhataa hum yah un chunautiyon main se ek he jisko hamen samaaj ke taur par or vaishvik samaaj ke taur par paar paanaa hoga
 India Today Group: On the question of privacy, now banks protect our money, but companies like yours and cloud based solutions actually protect our data, our identity and more
 to yah chunauti kitni daraavnee he?satya nadelabuniyadi taur par jab ham jo kuch karte hai use rasta dikhaane vaale usulon ke bare main main sochataa hum, to niztaa, suraksha, desh ke kanoonon kaa paalan karne vaala hona, ye hamaare liye sabase ahm hai
 So when we think about our cloud infrastructure, then i think about them all
 sabase pehla he ki bilkul atyaadhunik suraksha kaa vaaki hona—vaise zyaadaatar log suraksha ke bare main is tarah sochate hai ki yah ek kism kii ek baar kii cheez he
 It is not, because we know that safety is like going to the gym, you have to get up every morning and go to the gym daily to stay fit
 aisa nahin ho saktaa ki aap duusare logon ko gym jate dekhen or kahen, oh, mujhe behatar mahasoos ho rahaa he
 This is the first thing about security
 ek sabase ahm baat yah he ki parichaalan kii suraksha ko lekar aapkaa rukh jitna zyada bada hoga, suraksha ke irdagird aapaki kshamtaayen bhi utani hi behatar hongi
 But we are never satisfied with the cutting edge and we are always pushing the boundaries further back
 duusari baat niztaa ke bare main he
 i think about privacy - the important thing is to be very transparent about what the data is, why it is being collected, why it is being used
 isliye waapas yujar ke haath main kaman saunpane ke liye, chaahe vah saansthanik yujar ho yaa antim yujar ho, main sochataa hum ki jidipiar (general data protection regaullation) se jude europea niyam-kaayade saaf taur par zyada se zyada duniya ke maanakon ko tay karne ja rahe hai ki harek nijee yujar ke liye iske kya myne hai
 So this is another very big part in which we are investing and towards which we are working
 teesraa pahalu yah he ki, misaal ke liye, hamane bharat main data centre kyon banaae
 We are essentially building these modern factories in India, in which we have invested huge data centers
 or aisa isliye he taaki hindustan kaa data hindustan kii digital samprabhutaa ke bheetar rah sake, taaki public sector is par bharosa kar sake, or phir kisi bhi niamkeey audit vagairah kaa paalan kiya ja sake jo bharat sarkaar chalaanaa chaahati he yaa koi bhi duusari agency chalaanaa chaahati he
 India Today Group: What is more difficult, to follow the principles or to be removed from them as an exception? Satya Nadella: In a little immaturity of the laws and regulations around the world for privacy and security around the world, for our like-minded tech companies Walking is a very important thing
 yah aakhirkaar is baat ko maananaa he ki ham vibhinn deshon ke kaayade-kanoonon se bandhe hai
 We are not above the law
 ham alag-alag deshon ke sandarbh main or unke kanoonee dhaanche ke bheetar kaam karte hai
 But after saying this we cannot act arbitrarily
 mujhe lagata he ki duniya ke liye sabase ahm yah he ki vah kisi ek siio kii naitikta par yaa kisi ek company ke kinhin bhi usulon par nirbhar na rahe
 But we have to recognize that it is very important for the world to strike a balance on the most important issues of our time, just like if we give only one example, what will be the balance between privacy and security
 yah behad ahm he
 It is not only important in India, it is important for all countries, and they have to come together and say that we have shared a common understanding, like we have taken up human rights or climate change or many other issues
 Has been established aapako yah hasil karnaa hi hoga, is par ek vaishvik sarvanumati banani hogi
 If we do not make this, then we have to bear the consequences
 india today grupah aakhir main, kya aapane kabhi hindustan lautne or chizon ko badalane main sidhe madad karne ke bare main sochaa he?satya nadelahmere dimag main koi andeh nahin he ki main hindustan main apni viraasat or apni parvarish ke liye bahut zyada ehsaanmand hum
 i have deep connections with India and will never leave my side
 abhi jo mere paas he, vah ek mauka he—aaj jo naukari mere paas he or aaj jo plateform mere paas he uski badaulat—jisase main waapas na keval us desh ko jisamen main paidaa hua, balki duniya ko bhi yogadan de saktaa hum
 So i want to do anything and everything that i can to contribute back to India in a variety of ways
 karmchaaree bhavishya nidhi sanghathan (ipiefo) maamle main centre sarkaar baikfoot par aa gai he
 After sharp protests, the central government has announced to maintain the status quo in the matter for the next three months
 pief se rakam nikaale jane kii prakriya ko sakht karne ke notification ko sarkaar ne 31 july tak roak diya he
 Union Labor Minister Bandaru Dattatreya said on Tuesday that during this time we will discuss with all stakeholders related to PF
 unka yah faisla karmchaariyon ke pief se rakam nikaalane kii prakriya ko sakht karne ke khilaaf desh ke vibhinn hisson main chal rahe tej virodh ke bich aayaa he
 The Ministry of Labor announced the amendment in the rules on Monday, saying that any account holder can withdraw the entire amount deposited in the account for treatment, housing, marriage and education of children
 isse pehle nae niyam ke virodh main pradarshan kar rahe bangaleru ke garment factory karmchaariyon par police ne lathicharge kiya jisamen chaar pulicekarmiyon samet kai pradarshnkaree bhi ghayal ho gaye
 Demonstrations caused major roads to be jammed and many ambulances were stuck in the jam
 factory karmchaaree sarkaar ke usfaisle ke virodh main pradarshnakar rahe the jisamen pief ke niyamon badlaav kii baat kahi gai thi
 During the protest, the mob started throwing stones at the police and also vandalized some vehicles by setting them on fire
 karmchaaree sarkaar se faisle waapas maang lene kii maang kar rahe hai
 The police had to release Asu gas to control the agitating demonstrators
 is ghatana ke baad ilaake main police kii tainaati kar kar di gai he
 The rules were going to change from May 1, the Central Government had announced several new rules on the withdrawal of PF

 ' The Aam Aadmi Party is going to make Ceiling the main issue in view of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 AAP pravaktaa aatishi marlena ne aaj tak se baatcheet main kaha ki shanivaar se party dilli main ceiling ke mudde par ek campan shuru karne ja rahi he
 Atishi said that BJP was given both votes and donations by the traders and the same BJP has ruined the traders through GST, demonetisation and wide scale sealing
 dilli kii arthvyavastha aaj bhi vyapaariyon ke aadhaar par chalati he
 Because of sealing, not only Delhi's economy, but millions of people lost their jobs, sealing is a big issue for Delhi
 aatishi ne kaha ki dilli main bhaajapa ke 7 saansad hai, magar bhaajapa ke saaton saansad main se kisi ek ne bhi abhi tak sansad main is mudde par aawaaj nahin uthaai he
 Connecting the solution of sealing to the ordinance, Atishi said that only ordinance can make a difference on the issue of sealing and ordinance can only bring central government
 unhone kaha ki bijepi chaahe to is satr main bhi adhyadesh laa sakati he
 Speaking on the SC-ST Act, Atishi said that when the Supreme Court had given a decision on the SC-ST Act and asked for amendments, the BJP had brought the ordinance in the very next session
 agar bijepi chaahati ki dilli main ceiling naa ho to vah kisi bhi sansad ke adhiveshan main adhyadesh lekar aa sakati he magar dilli ke 7 saansad main se kisi ek ne bhi sansad main hi aawaaj nahin uthaai
 Speaking on the strategy for the Lok Sabha elections, Atishi said that the Aam Aadmi Party is going among the businessmen
 vyapaaree sirf ek cheez se pareshaan nahin hai, vyapaaree jiesti, notebandi or ceiling sabhi se pareshaan hai
 Due to the ceiling, BJP has cut the votes of 4 lakh bani
 bijepi ne tay kar liya he ki vah vyapaariyon or baniyon ke vot nahin chaahati he
 So she is sharing their business
 har dukandaar ajabijepico jiesti, notebandi or ceiling par gaaliyaan de rahaa he

 Seeing children picking up garbage in the streets seems at first sight to be child labor, but in reality the story is about bonded labor
 darasal, ye bachche parivaar se dur thekedaaron ke jariye rajdhani main daakhil hote hai or bacchon ko lekar kaam karne vaale sanghathanon kaa ishaara maanav taskari kii ore bhi he
 Such children get paid by the month and they are living in rented rooms in a herd, away from home family
 kamare kaa kiraaya bhi thekedaar dete hai
 a contractor has 20– 25 children, while someone has 10–15
 haath main bori or kooday main kaam kii chijen talashti najar
 Neither the trouble of the dirt and the stench, nor the worry of the scorching sun
 sadakon par kooda chunate aise bachche aapako kahin bhi dikh jaaenge, jo unke liye dihadi he
 Seeing them, at first sight there is confusion of child labor, but if we go to the bottom of the business, then the story of bonded labor comes
 darasal 5 se 13 saal tak kii umr ke in bacchon ko thekedaar bihar, upi, pashchim bengal or assam se dilli supplai karte hai
 These include the approval of their poor and forced parents
 dilli aate hi ye maasoom paise kamaane kii mashin ban jate hai or paise bhi rojaanaa nahin milte kooday ke vajan or umr ke mutabik hisaab maheene bhar kaa hota he
 The location of contractors bringing children to Delhi is also in the slums
 jinako hami bharne main thodaa bhi parhez nahin ki unke paas aise bachche hai
 If you look at the 2010 survey of Save the Children, according to this, one child is in the garbage business in every 5 street children of Delhi
 purvi dilli, uttar purvi dilli or pashchimi dilli main halaat zyada kharaab hai, jahaan har chaar street children main ek baccha is kaarobaar se judaa he
 In this way, the number of street children in Delhi is around 51 thousand and about 10 thousand children are involved in the garbage business
 rajdhani main kooday or kabad kaa yah kaarobaar karodon kaa he, jisase kareeb dedh lakh logon kii roji-roti chalati he
 Organizations like Bachpan Bachao, which work for children, are aware of this, but they believe that human trafficking and many other gangs are also associated with this business
 aankade bataate hai ki har ghante 7 bachche laapata hote hai, jinamein se teen kabhi nahin milte or salbhar main yah aankada 50 hajaar ko paar kar jaataa he
 On the other hand, if the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights believes that they do not have the rights in their hands, they have sent their suggestions to the state governments regarding such children
 saath hi street tu skool naam se ek muhim bhi chalaai he
 According to the doctors, the present future of the country looking for daily bread in the dirt is also in danger

 All-rounder Hardik Pandya is not getting out of the house nor picking up anyone's phone after the recent controversy
 hardik ko 'coffee vid karan' sho par mahilaon ke khilaaf die gaye bayaan ke baad bisisiai ne pratibandhit kar diya tha or australia se waapas bula liya tha
 Hardik Pandya's father has said that he (hardik) has stopped using social media
 hardik makar sankranti bhi nahin manaai, hardik kaa parivaar baroda se he or gujarat main yah tyohaar behad khaas he

 use patang udaana pasand he, lekin use cricket ke vyast kaarykram ke kaaran ghar par rahane kaa mauka nahin mila tha
 He said, 'this time he is at home and has a chance to fly a kite, but due to the strange situation he is not in the mood to celebrate the festival
 ' hardik ke saath salaami ballebaaj keel rahul bhi sho main pahunche the or un par bhi pratibandh he
 The Committee of Administrators (COA) had recommended a ban of two matches on both of them, but the BCCI has not yet taken a final decision on their punishment
 himanshu ne kaha, 'vah pratibandh se kaaphi niraash he or tivi par usne jo kaha uskaa use pachhtaawaa he
 He has vowed not to do so again
 'unhone kaha, 'hamane faisla kiya he ki ham is masale par usase baat nahin karenge

 In this, cooperation among all member countries is a major condition
 tippaniyan While this condition is not binding on bilateral relations between the two countries, all the old countries of the SCO want India and Pakistan to melt the ground ice on their relations
 yaad ho ki ufaa main 2015 main bhi donon pradhanmantri essio baithak ke dauraan hi mili the or baatcheet ke patari par laane kii koshish kii shuruyaat kii thi, lekin pakistan kii taraf se lagaataar aatanki vaardaaton kii vajah se ye patari par laut na sakin
 India has bluntly stated that terrorism and dialogue cannot go hand in hand
 isliye videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj bhi kah chuki hai ki piem narendra modi or nawaz sharif kii yahaan astana main koi nahin mulaaqaat hogi, lekin pakistan se mil rahi jaankaree ke mutabiq kulbhushan jadhav ICJ main shuruaati haar kaa munh dekh chuke pakistan par baatcheet kii pahal kaa baari dabaav he
 The problem is that he does not want to openly request talks

 According to sources, PM Modi also asked Nawaz Sharif how his mother and family were doing
 ullakheneey he ki kazakstan kii rajdhani astana main bharat or pakistan ke pradhanmantri pahunche hue hai
 The Foreign Ministry has refused any official meeting between the two
 
 Still, speculation is rife about a possible meeting between Prime Minister Modi and Nawaz Sharif to ease the growing tension between the two neighbors
 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne kaha, "unki or hamaari ore se koi baithak tay nahin kii gai he"

 Remember that in Ufa in 2015 also the two Prime Ministers met during the SCO meeting and started an effort to get the conversation back on track, but due to continuous terrorist incidents from Pakistan, they could not get back on track
 bharat do took lahaze main saafe kar chukaa he ki aatankwaad or baatcheet saath-saath nahin chal sakate
 Therefore, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj has also said that PM Narendra Modi and Nawaz Sharif will not meet here in Astana, but according to the information from Pakistan, Kulbhushan Jadhav has seen the initial defeat in the ICJ

 He further said, 'I will not comment on the decision of the court today because the decision of the court is in its place, but i want to raise a political question as to why he was not appearing

 Why did the CBI have to go there? isse pehle unako is sambandh main teen-chaar baar saman bhi jari kiya gaya tha
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that it is a matter of concern that for the first time in the history of the country, the commissioner level police officer sat on a dharna

 Let me tell you that his mission was also secret and his agenda was also secret
 inkaa jo sikret agenda tha vah tha ki kisi tareeke se rajya sarkaar ko dysteblise kiya jaae
 The Home Minister had said that if we are seeking a report from the Governor, his intention is clear

 Before Anna Hazare's proposed hunger strike on the Lokpal Bill, the Congress attacked him directly and said that Anna should first clarify the serious consequences of a commission inquiry against him
 party ne anna par desh main asthirataa failaane kii koshish karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 Party spokesman Manish Tiwari said, "the fast from August 16 has nothing to do with the issue of corruption or the Lokpal Bill
" ’’ unhone kaha ki nyaayamurti pibi saavant ayog ne hajaare kii naitikta kii pole khol di he jiske jaanch ke nateezon main bhrashtachar main aakanth duube paae gaye hai
 In 2003, the commission investigated corruption allegations leveled against Hazare by four ministers of the then Maharashtra government
 tiwari ne kaha, ‘‘16 agast se hone vaale anshan kaa bhrashtachar yaa lokapal vidheyak se kuch lenaa dena nahin hai
 If this is the case, then Hazare must first clarify the serious allegations of corruption
 gambhir parinaamon ke bare main unka kya spashtikaran he
 The country wants to know
 ’’unhone kaha, ‘‘meraa maananaa he ki hajaare or unke sahyogiyon ko saavant ayog ke nateezon kaa jawaab dene kii jarurat he
 The party also accused Hazare of systematically instigating instability in the country and insulting Parliament
 tiwari ne kaha ki ab tak unke prati bahut sahansheeltaa dikhaai ja chuki he
 He said, "when someone tries to bring instability, it becomes the responsibility of any political party to deal with (combat) it
 ’’tiwari ne aarope lagaaya ki team anna ‘‘avyaavhaarik fasivadiyon, samaaj main sambhraantata kaa nakaab odhe maovadiyon, chhipe hue araajaktaavaadiyon se bani hui he jo dakshinpanthi takaton ke peeche chhip rahe hai or adrishy daandaataaon se dhan hasil kar rahe hai jinke taar videsh se jude ho sakate hai
 Accusing Anna of insulting Parliament, the Congress leader also appealed to other political parties to raise their voice against it
 unhone kaha, ‘‘kuch log araajaktaa failaane par utaaru hai or sochate hai ki yah unka janmasiddh adhikaar he jabaki sachaai yah he ki paanch mantriyon ne unke saath (lokapal ke mudde par) silsilewar baatcheet kii
 However, Tiwari did not directly answer questions as to why the then government of Maharashtra did not take action against Hazare despite the findings, which formed the Sawant Commission and headed by his party
 unhone kaha, ‘‘sawaal naitikta kaa he, is baat kaa nahin ki maharashtra sarkaar hajaare ke prati naram kyon rahi
 At the press conference, Tiwari also read the details of the results of the Sawant Commission's inquiry into the matter related to Hazare's four trusts
 inamen gramin vikaas or naitik shiksha ke uddeshy se 1995 main gathit hind swaraj trust bhi shaamil he
 He claimed that Justice Sawant, in his 116-page report, referred Hazare to the trust 2 on his birthday celebrations
 2 lakh rupee kharch karne kaa doshi paaya he
 He said that according to the commission his act is illegal and is similar to corruption
 yadav baba shikshan prasaaran mandali ke sambandh main ayog ne kaha ki 20 saal se trust ne apane khate nahin diye hai
 Regarding another trust anti-corruption mass movement institute, Tiwari alleged that the commission concluded that some activists were misusing the platform through extortion, blackmail, and confiscation of other people's property
 unhone yah daawa bhi kiya ki paardarshita kii duhai dene vaale hajaare ne sena main apni seva ke dauraan apane yogadan ke bare main artiai ke tahat puche gayi ek sawaal kaa jawaab nahin diya
 Tiwari said that on May 27 this year, the question was sent to him under RTI and till date has not been answered
 unhone anna ke saathiyon nyaayamurti santosh hegade or shanti bhushan se kaha ki kya unhone hajaare se saavant ayog ke nishkarshon par koi safai maangi
 Taking a dig at the tone of Anna's letter to the Prime Minister, Tiwari said that Hazare has crossed the limits of dignity and courtesy
 unhone kaha, ‘‘yah pradhanmantri kaa nahin balki rashtriya dhvaj kaa apmaan he
 We want to ask how he is raising the issue of corruption, while the commission constituted under the chairmanship of a judge of the Supreme Court has found him involved in corruption from head to toe
 ’’tiwari ne kaha ki sarkaar sahansheeltaa baratati he lekin yadi koi lakshmana rekha paar karne kii koshish karata he to use uski jagah dikhaane kii jarurat he
 On whether the government should negotiate with Hazare, Tiwari said that he did not understand on what issue he was fasting when the Lokpal Bill is in Parliament
 unhone kaha, ‘‘hamane unke ret ke kile kii buniyaad dhaha di he
 "congress spokesperson avoids answering the question whether the situation after Hazare's movement resembles the situation of Jai Prakash Narayan in 1974
 hajaare kii tulana ramdev se karne par unhone kaha ki vah is par tippanee nahin karenge
 Attacking BJP President Nitin Gadkari's questions about the situation in the country before the Emergency, Tiwari raised the issue of illegal mining in Karnataka and said that Gadkari should tell the nation why he went to Bellary to bless the controversial Reddy brothers
 dhundh kii chadar main lipatedillimempradooshanke badhate str par paryaavaran mantralay main baithkon kaa daur jari he
 Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has reprimanded the central government for not submitting a survey report on illegal construction in the South Delhi Municipal Corporation
 SC ne centre ko lagaai fatkaardarasal sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne sarkari vakil se dakshin dilli nagar nigam (SDMC) main avaidh nirmaan par survey kii report talab kii
 The court arranged for the arrival of this report for 20 minutes and the hearing was stayed
 lekin jab report nahin ai to naaraaz court ne kaha ki jab kisi ko chintaa nahin to sirf adaalat hi isaki phikr kyon kare
 The court will now ask the officials on Friday about the report and the action taken on it
 baithak main nahin pahunche punjab-haryana ke mantridusri taraf dam ghontne vaali dhundh se jujh rahe dilli vaasiyon ke samaadhaan ke liye kendriya paryaavaran mantri dow
 Harshvardhan had called a meeting in the capital

 But none other than Delhi's Environment Minister Imran Hussain reached this meeting
 punjab-haryana ke mantri kii anupasthiti par kendriya paryaavaran mantri naaraaz ho gaye
 Prohibit the sale of firecrackers In order to reduce pollution in the national capital Delhi, the Supreme Court has approved the sale of only firecrackers, prohibiting the sale of firecrackers in Diwali, and has issued a timetable for firecrackers
 supreme court ke anusaar, diwali par log raat 8 baje se 10 baje tak hi pataakhe jala paaenge
 Apart from this, no seller will sell crackers online
 unki kalam ke jaadu kii duniya kaayal he, lekin unki kalam se is baar ho gai ek galati
 It is being talked about by the famous lyricist and writer Javed Akhtar, according to which the riot took place not in Uttar Pradesh but in Bihar
 darasal, micro bloging website twitor par akhtar sahab ne ek twit kiya he, jisamen unhone dangon kaa dard jhel rahe uttar pradesh ke mujffarnagar ko mujffarpur likh diya
 Let us tell you that Muzaffarpur is a district of Bihar

 There is a lot of anger against the state government and administration due to this incident
 javed akhtar bhi is vaardaat se kaaphi dukhi hai or unhone isaki tulana rape se kii he
 He chose Twitter to express his anger, but he made a mistake
 unhone apane twit main mujffarnagar ko mujffarpur likh diya
 According to his tweet, 'whatever happened in Muzaffarpur is a national shame
 vahaan shadyantr rachakar ekta, sauhaard, shanti or sadiyon puraani samskruti kaa rape kiya gaya he
 'till the time of writing the news, 256 people have retweeted this tweet
 skool time life kaa best time hota he
 But when we are in school, we do not like going to school and at the time of exam we start hating school
 jab ham skool chhodkar college main aa jate hai to hamen pataa chalata he ki skool main bitaye pal hi jindagi ke sabase khushnuma or yaadgaar pal hote hai
 Although we miss school time a lot, but we are telling you 10 such things that every girl misses about her school
 1
 Waking up early in the morning: How much we hated the morning alarm during our school time
 us samay hamen pataa chalata tha ki hamaare bed ke saath hamaara kitna gaharaa rishta he
 2
 taiyaar hona:apane boring skool uniform ko stylish banane main ham kitni mehnat karte the
 Buying short skirts and wearing socks was the trend
 agar skool main kisi special se milanaa hota tha- to kya hi kahana
 Then without makeup we wanted to look the most beautiful
 3
 Crush on seniors: How good were the days of watching seniors secretly
 lagbhag sabake skool main ek good looking senior to hota hi tha jisase hamaari ankhen hatati hi nahin thi
 But we never dared to talk to him
 4
 The day of wearing casual wear: The day when we used to wear casual clothes in school, there was no place for our happiness
 class 7 tak apane berthde par kejual kapade pehananane kii anumati thi lekin uske baad thodi hichak hone lagati thi
 The tradition remained confined to Farewell and the class assembly
 5
 Birthday and canteen food: There was great joy in school on my birthday
 bhale hi celibrasion simple hota tha lekin hamen bahut hi special feel hota tha
 'happp xxrep 6 y Biiirr xxrep 5 t xxrep 5 h dd xxrep 4 a xxrep 4 y tt xxrep 4 o yyyooo xxrep 4 u !' When the whole class sang, it was not known whose side to look at
 iske baad canteen main treet hoti thi
 6
 skool funshan:compatishan or skool funshan ke liye taiyaari karnaa bahut hi mjedaar hota tha
 Staying in school even after school time for practice, having fun with students from other sections, eating snacks was a different fun
 skool ellection kaa bhi apana alag hi craij hota tha
 Preparing for election speeches, campaigning and a little politics is also one of the memorable moments of school time
 7
 School Bell: The bell ringing after every period was over, but the bell of the holiday cannot be compared to anything else
 8
 Getting punishment: Standing outside the class with ears, keeping fingers in the mouth - getting such punishment was common in those days
 teacher ke daantne par muskuraane kaa majaa hi alag tha
 9
 teacher:hamaare parents ke baad hamaare shikshakon ko hi hampar sabase zyada naaj hua karata tha
 They were ready to help us in every way possible
 unase hi hamen jindagi kaa sabase bada tohfa-'gyaan' mila he
 10
 dost:skool ke samay hui dosti sabase zyada gahari hoti he
 The way friends are made during school time, they are not made at any point in life

 modi ji ke uparajyapal
 
 
 Modi's CBI
 
 
 ye tamaam aarope dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal lagaate rahe hai
 Arvind Kejriwal, the head of the Aam Aadmi Party, which took power with a thumping majority in 2015, did not miss any opportunity, when the Modi government at the Center was not accused of disrupting the functioning of the Delhi government
 yahaan tak ki 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav to aam aadmi party ne dilli ko purna rajya ke darje ke mudde par hi ladaa taaki dilli sarkaar janata ke liye saare faisle khud le sake
 But despite all these accusations and counter-insurgency and the war of words, Kejriwal's party could not win a single Lok Sabha seat and since the results came out on May 23, his style seems to have changed completely
 arvind kejariwal ne ab puri tarah se apni line badal lee he
 He is repeatedly talking about working closely with the central government
 piem modi ko jeet par badhai dene ke saath kejariwal ne sahyog kii maang uthaane kaa jo bidaa uthaaya wo lagaataar chal rahaa he
 On June 21, when Kejriwal and PM Modi met after a long time, Kejriwal urged the Prime Minister to visit Mohalla Clinic and Government School in Delhi
 piem modi se arvind kejariwal kii mulaakaat (file photo)iske baad haal hi main jab arvind kejariwal nai dilli vidhansabha kshetra main sisitivi kaa udghaatan karne pahunche to unhone media se baatcheet main phir centre sarkaar ke saath milakar dilli kii bhalaai ke liye kaam karne kii baat kahi
 Arvind Kejriwal could not be formed from any LG, from the Lieutenant Governor to Kejriwal's encounter, to the current Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal
 yahaan tak ki door-tu door rashan yojana kii file paas na karne ke mudde par to kejariwal puri cabinet ko lekar uparajyapal ke karyaalay main dharne par baith gaye or kai dinon tak vahiin date rahe
 But this week Arvind Kejriwal reached Lt
 Governor Anil Baijal's residence and met him for about 25 minutes and discussed action against corrupt officials
 alji anil baijal se mulaakaat ke dauraan arvind kejarivaludghaatan samaaroh par takaraoktober 2018 main dilli ke itio sthit skywalk ke udghaatan ke maukey par centre or kejariwal sarkaar main thani rahi
 Finally, Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri inaugurated with the Lieutenant Governor and the Kejriwal government was not invited
 kejariwal sarkaar kii taraf se iskaa palatwaar kiya gaya or agle hi maheene november 2018 main yamuna nadi par bane signechar brij kaa udghaatan arvind kejariwal ne kar diya
 The Central Government was not invited to this function
 lekin dilli bijepi adhyaksh manoj tiwari pahunch gaye or vahaan dhakka-mukki kii bhi naubat aa gai
 After all the sourness at the inauguration ceremony, a shared picture of the Center and the Delhi government came to light on Tuesday when the sewage treatment plant at Okhla was inaugurated
 is kaarykram main kendriya jal shakti mantri gajendra singh shekhavat or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal donon maujuud rahe
 Kejriwal also thanked the Modi government for this and wrote in the tweet that thank you very much for the support of the central government
 mujhe vishwaas he ki ham milakar yamuna nadi ko jald saaf karne main zarur kaamyaab honge
 At the same time, when 9 murders took place in 24 hours inside Delhi last month, Kejriwal himself along with Aam Aadmi Party leaders asked questions to the Delhi Police on Twitter
 lekin agle hi media ko die bayaan main unhone phir centre or dilli sarkaar dwaara milakar kaam karne kii baat kahi
 However, as far as the Delhi Police is concerned, Kejriwal has not yet met Home Minister Amit Shah, under whom the Delhi Police comes
 is tarah loksabhaa chunaav nateezon ke baad se aise kai maukey dekhne ko mili hai, jab kejariwal ke bayanon main modi sarkaar ke prati na sirf sahajata najar ai he balki wo baar-baar sahyog kii baat bhi kar rahe hai
 Such a stance of Kejriwal has been seen for the first time in the tenure of more than four years
 phalgun maah kii poornima (16 march) ko holikaa dahan kiya jayega or iske agle din 17 march ko dhulendi (holi) par rang-gulaal khelkar khushiyaan manaai jaaegi
 According to the scriptures, Holika takes place eight days before the burning
 iske anusaar holashtak lagane se holi tak koi bhi shubh sanskaar sampann nahin kiye jate
 According to classical tradition, Holashtak started on Saturday 8 March and now 16 samskaras like naming ceremony, janeu rite, home entrance, marriage ceremony have been banned
 ye shubh kaary dhulendi ke baad hi shuru honge
 Due to the setting of the star during Holashtak, marriage rites can now be done after about one and a half months, ie only after April 14
 yah bhi manyata he ki holi ke pehle ke aath dinon ashtami se lekar poornima tak prahlada ko kaaphi yatnaaen di gai thim
 It became a tradition to consider those eight days full of torture as inauspicious
 hindu dharm main kisi bhi ghar main holi ke pehle ke aath dinon main shubh kaary nahin kiye jate
 Pt
 manoj shukla kehete hai ki holashtak kaa sambandh bhagwaan vishnu ke bhakt prahlada va unke pita atyaachaari hiranyakashyap kii katha se he
 According to Skanda Purana, King Hiranyakashyap of demonic instincts had jealousy and jealousy with Lord Vishnu
 uske rajya main jo koi bhagwaan vishnu kii puja-archana karata tha use maut kii sajaa sunai jaati thi
 Fearing the king's decree, no one in his kingdom worshiped Lord Vishnu
 katha prasang ke anusaar raja hiranyakashyap kaa putr prahlada bhagwaan vishnu kaa bhakt tha
 When the king came to know about his son Prahlada's Vishnu devotion, he explained to Prahlada but Prahlada did not stop to do devotion to Lord Vishnu
 isse krodhit hokar raja ne apane putr ko mrityudand kii sajaa sunai
 On the king's orders, the soldiers tortured the devotee Prahlada many times
 use marane ke liye junglee jaanwaron ke bich choda, nadi main dubo diya, oonche parvat se bhi phenkaa gaya
 Prahlada survived the grace of God at every sentence
 ant main raja ne apni bahan holikaa kii god main bithakar prahlada ko jinda jala daalane kaa hukum diya
 The king's sister Holika had a boon that she would not be consumed in the fire
 prabhu krupa se prahlada to batch gaya magar holikaa jal gai
 The tradition of Holika Dahan started from that day
 lagaataar teen test match haar chuki team india ne edilade test main shuruyaat to acchhee kii lekin australia ne baad main apni pakad bana lee
 By the end of the first day's play, Australia had scored 335 runs losing 3 wickets thanks to a brilliant unbeaten century by former captain Ricky Ponting and current captain Michael Clarke
 pehle din ke stamps tak ponting ne 13 chaukon kii madad se 254 gend khelkar 137 ran banaae vahiin captain clark ne 19 chauke or ek chakke kii madad se 188 gend khelkar 140 ran bana liye hai
 Ponting and Clarke played a key role in recovering the Australian team that lost 3 wickets within 100 runs
 ponting or clark ke bich chauthe wicket ke liye 251 ran kii saajhedaari ho chuki he
 Ponting first scored a half-century and then became the third Test batsman to complete 13 thousand runs in Test cricket
 iske baad poting ne apana 41waan test shatak bhi jamaa diya
 Meanwhile, captain Michael Clarke has also hit a Test century in the second Test in a row

 By tea time, Australia had scored 214 at the loss of three wickets

 The partnership between these two batsmen has also been around 200 runs
 toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karne utari australia kii shuruyaat acchhee nahin rahi or bharat ne saatven over main use pehla jhatka diya
 At that time Australia's score was just 26 runs

 Warner contributed 8 runs and Zaheer Khan lbw him and sent him back to the pavilion
 australia ne 10wein over tak 31 ran par do wicket ganvaa die the jiske baad kowan or ponting ne tisare wicket ke liye 53 ran jodakar pari ko sanbhaalane kii koshish kii
 Zaheer gave India the first success by lbw to Warner in the seventh over of the innings
 jahir kii gend ko peeche jaakar khilne kii koshish main warner chook gaye or ampire ko unhen out dene main koi hichak nahin hui
 Off-spinner Ashwin gets his chance to bowl in the fourth over of the innings and he did not disappoint his captain and soon uprooted Marsh off-stump
 jahir or aswin ke pehle spel puure karne ke baad bhartiya gendbaajon ne kaaphi ran kharch kiye
 Umesh Yadav conceded 41 runs in the first five overs
 ponting ne yadav ko nishaanaa banaaya or apane pehle paanch chauke isi tej gendbaaj par jade
 He took the ball to the boundary by playing flick shot in addition to pull and hook
 mahendra singh dhoni par ek match kaa pratibandh lagane ke baad captaini kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe sahvaag ne lunch se aadha ghanta pehle aswin ko duusare spel ke liye bulaayaa to ponting ne unka swaagat sweep shaat se chaar ran batorkar kiya
 Ashwin, however, brought India a third success by sending Cowan to the pavilion

 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which has so far kept silent on the issue of coal block allocation issue in Parliament, has attacked the Congress sternly saying that the country is not its fiefdom which it arbitrarily loots the government treasury And the people of the country kept watching everything blindly
 darasal, yah baat sangh ke mukhpatr panchajnya ne kahi he
 The Sangh had so far kept silence on the ongoing stalemate on the issue
 pehali baar apane mukhpatr ke madhyam se usne is mudde par congress par nishaanaa saadhaa he or apni baat rakhi he
 The latest issue of Panchajanya states, "the country is not the property of the Congress to arbitrarily loot government treasury and the public should shut their eyes
" rashtramandal khel ghotaalaa, 2-ji spectrum ghotaalaa va ab koyala khadaan aavanton ghotaalaa jaise mahabhrashtachar ke ek ke baad ek aayam judate chale ja rahe hai

 Frustrated with all this scolding, the Congress is accusing the opposition of running away from the debate, while it has been reluctant to respond to the big scams under the umbrella of this government
 " The Sangh has openly attacked the Prime Minister, saying through it, "when the Prime Minister came to the Lok Sabha to answer, he tried to prove his innocence by targeting the Opposition and the CAG instead of keeping the facts
" swayan congress ne bhi bhaajapa or sieji ke prati hi apni talkhi dikhaai or party adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne iske virodh main party ke sadakon par utarane kaa elaan kar diya

 " The mouthpiece said how this government is providing opportunities to loot the country's treasury and India's natural wealth that 142 coal mines have been allocated to private companies without auction and the Prime Minister has been clarifying that the CAG The report is wrong and he will not resign from the post

 ) Today in religion we are going to introduce you to the miracle of Ganga in Kali Yuga
 kalyug main mahadev ke prati ganga kii bhakthi kii teen aisi chamatkaari kahaniyaan, jinhen dekhne ke baad aapkaa sir khud-ba-khud shraddhavash jhuk jayega
 So first let's go to Ramgarh
 yahaan maa ganga 24 ghante mahadev kaa abhishek karti hai
 It is said that whoever has seen this form of mother, there is no wish left for him
 shiv kii shakti, ganga kii bhakthi kii ye wo anuthi tasviir he
 This form of God and his miracle in Kali Yuga makes the atheist also a believer
 maa ganga yahaan mahadesh kaa abhishek karti hai, vah bhi 24 ghante
 In the Mahadev temple of Ramgarh district of Jharkhand, when the devotees reach to worship their worship, they see this reverence here
 is mandir main shivlinga ke thik upar maa ganga virajman hai
 a 24-hour stream of water flows from their navel
 is dhara main shiv bheegate rahete hai or apane bhakton ko aashirwad dete hai
 No one knows where this water comes from
 sookhaa ho yaa barsaat, sardi ho yaa garmi, ganga kii naabhi se jal bahna kabhi band nahin hota
 Raghunath Das, the priest of this unique temple of Mahadev, said that the devotees call it as a broken waterfall
 ye mandir 1925 main astitv main aayaa, jab angrej rail line bichaane ke liye jameen kii khudaai karvaa rahe the
 During the excavation, he realized something domed in the ground
 achche se dekhne par yah mandir saamne aayaa
 Much effort was made to find out where this water comes from, but it was not successful
 or jab yah bhed nahin khul sakaa to phir ise mahadev kaa chamatkaar maanakar is sawaal ko hameshaa ke liye chhod diya gaya
 Bablu, a devotee of Mahadev, says that any devotee who sees this amazing form of God in a broken waterfall temple gets fulfilled
 shiv or ganga ke chamatkaari rup ke darshan karne ke liye yahaan hameshaa shraddhaluon ko tantaa laga rahata he
 Devotees accept the water falling on the Shivling as Prasad and take it to their home and keep it
 kehete hai is jal main itani shaktiyaan samahit hai ki ise grahan karne ke saath hi man shant ho jaataa he
 You get the strength to fight with sorrows
 ab ham aapako bataane ja rahe hai duusare sthal ke bare main
 Mother Ganga worships Gangadhar by tearing the chest of the earth in Surat
 surat main ek aisa shivlinga he jo khandit he, isamen anginat chhed hai or inhen chhidron se ganga kii dhara bahati he
 This form of Gangadhar has been described as amazing and rare
 yah rup baar-baar dekhne ko nahin miltaa
 The philosophy of this form can only cross the devotee's eyes because in this form, the destroyer of the world Shiva and the life-giving mother Ganga are seen together
 yah to aapane suna hi hoga ki ganga shiv kii jataaon se hokar nikali thim
 Mahadev held the velocity of the Ganges
 is khandit shivlinga ke peeche kii kahani ham aapako bataate hai
 It is said that this Shiva lingam installed in the Siddhnath temple at Olapad in Surat district of Gujarat is said to be self-contained and in a fractured state for hundreds of years
 kehete hai saikadon saal pehle siddhanath mahadev mandir ko luteron ne luutane kii koshish kii
 The robbers felt that the treasure was hidden under the Shivling
 isliye unhone shivlinga par kulhadi se kai prahaar kiye, jisase isamen chhed ho gaye
 It is said that Mahadev then appeared angry as vortices from these holes and drove the robbers to death
 mandir ke pujari janak bhai goswami ne bataaya ki lutere to bhaag gaye lekin mandir kii pavitrataa lautaane ke liye mahadev ko ganga kaa aahvaan karnaa padaa
 The Gupta Ganga, which appeared in Shivling with the permission of Shiva, flows in its rhythm even today
 vaise hindu shastron ke mutabik khandit shivlinga kii aradhana nahin kii jaani chahie, lekin yahaan na keval mahadev ke is chamatkaari rup kii puja kii jaati he balki vidhi-vidhaan kaa paalan bhi kiya jaataa he
 Before the puja, Mahadev is bathed only with the water coming out of Shivling
 bhakt shiv ke is rup ke darshan kar nihaal ho jate hai
 a faithful devotee, Zankhana Ben Patel, says that the devotees who come here on the orders of Shiva in Shivalinga, use the Ganges water as the water
 ab ise chamatkaar nahin kahenge to or kya kahenge ki jahaan is mandir ke aas-paas kaa pani samudr kii nikatataa kii vajah se behad khaaraa he vahiin shivlinga se nikalne vaala jal nariyal ke pani kii tarah meetha he
 Devotees who come here get the good fortune of seeing Mahadev, while Ganga water also relieves them from many diseases
 vadodara main galteshwar mandir main bhi gupt ganga bahati he
 It washes the feet of the Ganges Mahadev
 ganga ke yahaan galati nadi ke naam se pukaarte hai bhakt
 It is said that mother Ganga changes her path here to touch the feet of Galteshwar Mahadev
 iske alaava chhattisgarh main ek lakh chhed vaale shivlinga main ganga or yamuna donon kii hi vaas he
 Devotees get the blessings of Mahadev as well as Mother Ganga and Yamuna here

 asia cap 2018 main afghanistan ne bharat ke saath vanade match ko taai kar diya
 That is, the scores of both countries are equal
 afghanistan ne 49
 Losing 8 wickets in 5 overs scored 252 runs, while India also scored 252 runs in 50 overs
 yani match drow ho gaya
 But you yourself can guess who won in the eyes of cricket lovers
 
 Yes, Afghanistan may have been out in the Asia Cup, but in the hearts of the people, Afghanistan is the winner
 vajah he ki is asia cap main afghanistan ne pehle srilanka ko 91 ranon se haraaya phir bangladesh ko 136 ranon se or bharat ke saath match barabari kaa
 The record of Afghanistan in a small format is quite good
 vah tii-20 main 8 wein sthaan par he
 Ahead of Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and Ireland
 vahiin ek divasiy cricket main vah 10 wein number par he, zimbabwe se aage
 Real cricket in Afghanistan began in 2000 when the Taliban lifted a ban on playing cricket
 afghanistan ke kai khilaadiyon ne apane cricket kii shuruyaat rifuji campon main kii jo adhiktar pakistan main the
 These included players like Navroj Mangal, Mo Nabi and Karim Sadiq
 afghanistan cricket federation ko 2001 main manyata di gai
 But the political situation in Afghanistan only got worse
 america par 9 / 11 hamale ne halaat ko or kharaab bana diya
 The US attacked Afghanistan and the situation became worse
 magar afghanistan ke pathaanon ne jajba nahin choda or date rahe ki ek na ek din duniya ko dikhaa denge ki ham bhi kisi se kam nahin hai, or kisi bhi din kitni bhi badi team ko haraa sakate hai
 India has a huge hand in the rise of Afghanistan cricket
 2015 main bharat ne greater noida ke shahid vijay singh pathik ke naam se stadium afghanistan ko de diya
 The stadium became the home ground of Afghanistan
 phir afghanistan ne dehradun main bangladesh ke khilaaf teen tii-20 match kii shrikhala kii mejabani kii
 Not only this, the Cricket Board of India has made an agreement with all the countries that whichever foreign team will come to India, they will have to play at least one ODI match from Afghanistan
 purv bhartiya coach lalchand rajput bhi ek vakt main afghanistan ke coach rahe, manoj prabhakar bhi
 Later became bowling coach
 afghanistan ke paas teen aise spinner hai jo vishwa stareey hai
 Rashid Khan is the world's number one bowler
 phir mujeeb or nabi
 That is, any team will have to play 30 overs spin, which is becoming very difficult today
 chaahe pich kisi bhi ho, inhen safalataa jarur milti he
 The comments kal ke match main bhale hi bharat ke kuch diggaj khilaadi nahin khel rahe the, bhale hi kuch ampiring ke faisle bharat ke paksh main nahin gaye or bhale hi match taai par chuta ho, magar tamaam cricket premiyon ke liye yah afghanistan ke liye jeet se kam nahin he
 So hail Afghanistan cricket

 raashtrapati baraak obama ne america ke aarthik sudhaar ke liye apana drushtikon jaahir karte hue duniyabar main america vyapaar ko badhaava dene kaa sankalp liya he
 In this regard, he referred to an American trade mission that visited India recently
 obama ne ohio ke cleveland main chote vyapaariyon ke ek kaarykram main hissaa lete hue ek choti company kaa zikr kiya, jo duniya main apane tarah ke anuthe lacheele drav crystal disple kaa kent main utpaadan karti he
 Obama said that Albert Green, the chief executive officer (CEO) of Kent Displays, wants to maintain its production base in Ohio itself
 "lekin vaishvik pratispardhaa main bane rahane ke liye unhen nai praudyogiki main nivesh karnaa hoga, or unhen ucch kushal sthaneey shramashakti kii jarurat hogi saath hi unhen apane utpaada ko duniya bhar main bechnaa hoga
 "so he attended the Forum's export session on Tuesday with Commerce Minister Gary Locke and was also involved in a trade mission to India
 obama ne kaha, "ve jahaan bhi gaye logon ne unase poocha : kya aapke utpaada america main bane hai?" obama ne kaha, "duniya america utpaada chaahati he
 And our administration is going to promote American business worldwide
 aapako yah pataa hona chahie

 film main rakul preet or tabboo unke apojit role main thim
 The film was well received at the box office
 ajay devgan philhal 'tanaji: da ansang hero' kii shooting main biji hai
 Om Raut will make his directorial debut with this film
 is film main kaajol or saf ali khan bhi nazar aaenge
 Akshay Kumar may return in the third part of the 2008 superhit film Welcome
 khabar he ki film ke nirmaataa firoz nadiadwala or akshay main sulah ho gai he or akshay iske tisare bhaag main kaam karne ko raji ho gaye hai
 The comments film 'welcome' ke sikval 'welcome bek' se akshay baahar ho gaye the
 It is said that Akshay had demanded Rs 50 crore from Nadiadwala for the sequel, due to which Feroze made the film 'welcome Back' with John Abraham in place of Akshay
 haalanki, sikval ne bhi 100 karod se zyaada kaa kaarobaar kiya, magar visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki agar film 'welcome back' main akshay hote to iskaa kaarobaar 20 se 30 karod or bad saktaa tha
 Perhaps this is the reason why Nadiadwala has reconciled with Akshay and has now convinced Akshay to come in the third part
 udhar, khabar yah bhi he ki iske nirdeshak film ke tisare bhaag kaa nirdesan karne ke liye anis baazmi bhi taiyaar ho gaye hai, kyonki anis baazmi bhi nadiadwala se khafa the
 Anees complained that Nadiadwala had not paid his wages, for which he had complained
 magar ab khabar he ki anis or firoz main bhi sulah ho chuki he, yani is film ke tisare bhaag main film 'welcome' kii puraani team waapas saath aa sakati he
 Akshay was left out of the sequel 'welcome Back' from the movie Welcome
 bataaya jaataa he ki us sikval ke liye akshay ne nadiadwala se 50 karod rupee maang liye the, is vajah se firoz ne akshay kii jagah jon abraham ke saath film 'welcome back' banaai
 Although the sequel also did a business of over 100 crores, experts believe that if the film 'welcome Back' had Akshay, its business could have increased by 20 to 30 crores
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki nadiadwala ne akshay ke saath sulah kar lee he or ab iske tisare bhaag main akshay ko aane ke liye raji kar liya he
 On the other hand, the news is that its director Anees Bazmee has also agreed to direct the third part of the film, as Anees Bazmee was also upset with Nadiadwala
 anis ko shikaayat thi ki nadiadwala ne unka mehtaanaa nahin diya he, jiske liye unhone shikaayat kii thi
 But now there is news that there is a reconciliation between Anees and Feroze as well, that in the third part of this film, the Purani team of the film 'welcome' can come back together
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki nadiadwala ne akshay ke saath sulah kar lee he or ab iske tisare bhaag main akshay ko aane ke liye raji kar liya he
 On the other hand, the news is that its director Anees Bazmee has also agreed to direct the third part of the film, as Anees Bazmee was also upset with Nadiadwala
 anis ko shikaayat thi ki nadiadwala ne unka mehtaanaa nahin diya he, jiske liye unhone shikaayat kii thi

 ) Air Pollution check karne kaa aasaan tarika
 Can use till date tracker or app
 dilli main is samay hawa jahrili ho chuki he or AQI level khatarnaak ke upar ja chukaa he
 You can use apps or websites to check air quality
 aaj tak ke Air Pollution Trakcer se bhi aap apane lokation kii real time air quality check kar sakate hai
 The situation has worsened since Diwali
 kisaanon kaa paraali jalaane kii silsilaa bhi nahin tham rahaa he or is vajah se dilli-ensriar kii hawa or bhi jahrili ho chuki he
 Many places in Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad and Gurgaon have crossed the AQI of 1000
 AQI ko mote taur par paanch yaa chah part main baanta jaataa he
 You can check this by downloading free apps
 isse pehle aap ye jaan len ki AQI kaa puraa funda kya he
 How much AQI is right for you and which are dangerous
 0-50 AQI hone kaa matlab hawa acchhee he, pradooshan nahin he
 51-100 puts AQI in the Moderate category
 51-100 AQI main salaah di jaati he ki jo sensitive log hai wo outdoor activity ko kam kar sakate hai
 101–150 aqis are kept in the Unhealthy category for some people
 sensitive logon ke liye ye puri tarah se Healthy nahin he or sensitive grups ko is tarah kii hawa biimaar kar sakati he
 151– 200 AQI is considered Unhealthy and is for everyone
 aap biimaar hai yaa nahin phir bhi ye aapke liye khatarnaak he
 201-500 AQI - Very Unhealthy - As mentioned earlier, it is more dangerous than this and during this time you can notice the emasculation
 is dauraan baahar kam nikalne kii salaah di jaati he
 301-500 AQI - Hazardous - That is, during this time common people have high risk
 health effects honge isse log biimaar honge
 During this PM 2
 5 mask pahanane kii salaar di jaati he or outdoor activity puri tarah se nahin karne kii salaah di jaati he
 But currently most areas of delhi-ncr have more than 500 aqis and most apps are not designed to measure AQI more than this, as these levels of pollution are not seen generally
 isse pehle ye Beijing ko zyada air palution vaala shahar mana jaataa tha, lekin is vakt dilli main bejing ke mutabale 8 guna zyada air palution he

 These apps give you the correct data related to AQI and they are easy to use as well

 bainkon kaa kahana he ki epady par tex ke kaaran graahak us ore aakarshith nahin hote or mutual fund jaisi yojanaon kii ore chale jate hai
 Tax exemption is not uniform under Section 80c of Income Tax

 But so far LG has not given any assurance on Kejriwal's demand
 mana ja rahaa he ki aaj is maamle main koi bada faisla kiya ja saktaa he
 Health Minister Satyendra Jain, sitting on a hunger-strike, has been hospitalized on Sunday due to a sudden deterioration of health
 kejariwal, manish sisodiya or gopal raay abhi bhi uparajyapal ke daftar par jame hue hai
 On Sunday, Chief Ministers of Karnataka, West Bengal, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh appealed to PM Narendra Modi to intervene to end the deadlock between the two
 in chaaron rajyon ke mukhyamantri ne apana samarthan kejariwal ko diya or kaha ki ek chuni hui sarkaar ke khilaaf dilli main jo kuch ho rahaa he, wo galat he
 On the other hand, there has been no indication of initiative by the Central Government or LG in this matter
 aise main aam aadmi party ke paas ab khud is dharne ko khatm karne kaa hi vikalp bachaa he
 Satyendra Jain has been admitted to the hospital and Gopal Rai is seeing a steady decline in health
 agar isi tarah ke halaat bane rahe to kejariwal or sisodiya kii sehat par bhi asar pad saktaa he
 This is the reason why the party is trying to find a way to end this strike and its leaders can claim victory
 aam aadmi party ke aalaa netaaon ko lagata he ki jis uddeshy wo dharne par baithe the, wo bhale puraa na hua ho lekin jis tarah se baaki rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ne dilli main press conference kar kejariwal kaa samarthan kiya or centre ko is gatirodh ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya, usase dilli sarkaar kii maangon ko bal mila or janata main dharne kaa sahi massej gaya
 Not only this, the party is also strong due to the crowd on the streets of Delhi for the siege of Prime Minister's residence on Sunday
 desh kii kai raajnneetik partiyon ne is maamle main aam aadmi party or kejariwal ko samarthan diya he
 In the midst of all this, a party meeting is currently taking place at Kejriwal's residence
 jisamen aage kii ranneeti par charchaa hogi
 If sources are to be believed, the party can take a big decision regarding the dharna in this meeting
 agar bina iees kii hadtaal toote kejariwal dharne ko khatm karne kaa elaan karte hai to phir party ke liye yah ek tarah se peeche janaa hoga
 In such a situation, it will be the effort of the Kejriwal government to adopt such a way to end the dharna, so that the hunger strike also ends and the image of Kejriwal and his ministers in the public of Delhi should not be wrong
 yahi vajah he ki kal jab iees afasaron ne pressvarta kar elaan kiya ki ve tab tak dilli sarkaar ke mantriyon kii routine baithkon main nahin jaaenge jab tak unhen suraksha kaa aashwaasan nahin miltaa he to kejariwal ne turant video massej jari kar saaf kaha ki afasar unke parivaar ke sadasyon kii tarah hai or ve unki suraksha kii puri guarantee dete hai
 There is no response from the IAS Association to this appeal of Kejriwal yet, but if the officers trust the Chief Minister of Delhi and break their alleged strike then it will be like a win for Kejriwal
 duusari ore ye maamla ab hoicourt chalaa gaya he or court kii shuruaati tippanee kejariwal ke samarthan main nahin kahi ja saktin
 BJP and Congress are also trying to create an atmosphere, at least in Delhi, that due to Kejriwal's dharna, the development of Delhi has been stopped and work has come to a standstill
 aise main party agar is dharne ko jari rakhti he to uske liye janata ko jawaab dena mushkil ho saktaa he
 This is also the reason that now there is no option left in front of Kejriwal except to end this dharna at the earliest

 (from input language) jammu-kashmir se judi dhara 370 hataane ke modi sarkaar ke elaan par vipakshi dalon ne sansad main somvaar ko jamkar hangaamaa machaaya
 With this, political mobilization started at 370
 congress samet kai dalon ne modi sarkaar ke is faisle kii aalochana kii to kejariwal jaise dhur virdohi bhi modi sarkaar ke samarthan main khadey najar aae
 Let us see which party is in which court on Article 370

 JDU has 6 mps in the Rajya Sabha, but will not vote against the government in the House

 aam aadmi party kii kalah main team anna ke purv sadsy mufti shamoon kaasmi bhi kud pade hai
 Kasmi said that when he raised the issue of transparency and donations to India Against Corruption, Kejriwal showed him the way out of Team Anna
 kaasmi ne kaha, 'team anna main rahakar jin muddon ko main uthaa rahaa tha, prashanth bhushan bhi aaj unheen muddon ko uthaa rahe hai
 Kasami said that i had talked about bringing transparency in the meetings and putting the donation of India Angest Corruption in the Public Cause Research Foundation (PCRF), if at the same time people had supported, then AAP would not have had the problem of dictatorship
 'kaasmi ke mutabik, 'team anna main bhi chand log faisle karte the or baaki logon kaa kaam un par sirf muhar lagaana hota tha
 i had lodged my protest even then

 ' Commissioner, he really is his age to play from dolls
 or 15 april ko inheengudiyaase hi khilne wo apane nanhe paanv se ghar kii dahleez paar kar gai thi
 But at the door itself he found the devil who took him to his house
 or phir puure do dinon tak us maasoom ko nocha-khasota gaya
 He was kept in the room for two whole days
 is dauraan baap apni gudiya kii talash main dar-dar bhatakta rahaa
 Thought Commissioner Sahab has said such big things on December 16, it may have changed his police
 meri gudiya ko dhund laaegi
 But sorry, Commissioner
 
 
 uski galatfahami jaldi hi dur ho gai
 Commissioner Sir
 
 
 
 Your police shunned, but how could that poor father agree? Looked for rabi
 or aakhirkaar ghar ke neeche hi ek kamare se karaahne kii awaz ai to log us kamare tak ja pahunche
 The doll was imprisoned inside
 ek padosi ne hi use agava kiya tha or do dinon tak use nocha-khasota or phir zakhmi gudiya ko chhod kar bhaag gaya
 After two days, when the doll came out of the house, what was the situation, if you know the full reality of the wounds of this five year old doll being taken from one hospital to another on the stretcher, then believe me you will also scream
 
 vaise kamishnar sahab
 
 
 
 sirf likhane ke liye nahin balki sachmuch likh rahaa hum ki kisi ke zakhmon kaa hisaab likhane main isse pehle haath itnaa kabhi nahin kaanpe
 What should i say about his wounds? sunne ke liye bhi kalejaa chahie
 Just understand that when the doctors who spared the lives of others saw the wounds of this girl, this is what came out of her mouth
 
 
 
 
 kya koi insaan kisi phool jaisi bacchee ke saath aisa bhi kar saktaa he
 When that doll was first brought to the LNJP hospital on April 17, by the time her body did not know how much blood had been shed
 darindon ne puure jism par blade maar rakhi thi
 Most of his internal organs were injured in the lower part of the body
 pet ke andar teen mombatti or ek choti shishi padi thi
 What else can i say next, Commissioner? 
 
 
 You will not be able to hear
 naa ham bol paaenge
 The situation was such that the doctors themselves were not in a position to say anything
 garib baap ke liye itnaa hi santosh kaaphi tha ki chalo bacchee kam se kam doctoron ke haathon tak to pahunch gai
 Treatment has started
 par shaayad doctoron kii baaten sun kar uski bhi ummid tuutati ja rahi thi
 But the Commissioner, yet another face of shamelessness of your brave police was yet to be revealed
 khud to aapaki police gudiya ko dhund nahin pai, haa, jab uski kahani saamne ai to apni naukari bachaane ke liye aapaki hi police ne gudiya ke baap ko do hajaar rupye kii rishwat thama di
 In the name of tea-water
 taaki wo unke nikammepan kii kahani kisi ko naa sunaae
 But you do know
 tab tak gudiya kii kahani aam ho chuki thi
 What was the atmosphere like on December 16? pehle aap harakat main aae uske baad sarkaar
 Gudiya was immediately taken to AIIMS from LNJP Hospital for better treatment
 ji haa
 Just as the innocent was taken from Safdarjung to Singapore on December 16 after an uproar
 ho saktaa he ki doctoron kii dawa, logon kii dua or us gudiya kaa hausala uski jaan bachaa le
 But even if she was alive, the whole life would just keep complaining about life, in which Delhi did you produce me, where people scrape even a doll

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne uttar pradesh chunaav main kabristaan or shmashaan ghat kaa zikr kaa chhedaa to yah maamla ek mudda ban gaya
 Not only Uttar Pradesh, but this matter has been hot in bjp-ruled states
 khaastaur par chhattisgarh main sabakaa vikaas or sabakaa saath kii tarj par sabhi dharmo ke liye ek adad muktidhaam kii maang jor pakad gayi he
 Interestingly, its demand is arising from the ruling BJP itself
 iske liye baqayada bajet main praavdhaan kiye jane ko lekar jor aajamaaish bhi shuru ho gayi he
 In Chhattisgarh, the ruling BJP and the main opposition Congress have become active about the statement of Prime Minister Modi, which he waged to attack his opponents in the Uttar Pradesh elections
 kabristaan or shmashaan ghat ko lekar pradhanmantri modi ne samaajawaadee party par tikhaa hamalaa bolaa tha, lekin ab ye mudda bijepi shasit rajyon main bhi jor pakad gaya he
 It has started in Chhattisgarh, where the demand for a free Muktidham has arisen in all the small villages and cities of the state from within the party itself
 vah bhi baqayada tarkon or daleelon ke saath
 According to BJP leader and party executive committee member Ajay Shukla, there should be an arrangement in the budget for this, because the man's income throughout his life is seen in the funeral site in peace
 bijepi kaa mantra he, sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas
 For this, cremation grounds of Hindus, cemeteries for Muslims and funeral sites for Christians and Zoroastrians should also be well developed and developed, as this is a place where everyone has to go
 sirf bijepi hi nahin rajya kii mukhya vipakshi party congress bhi sabhi dharmon ke liye antim sanskaar ke sthalon ke rakh-rakhaav or vikaas ke liye salanaa bajet nirdhaarit karne kii maang kar rahi he
 Congress leader Prabhat Meghawale has demanded that the government make a provision in its annual budget
 chhattisgarh main hinduon ke shmashaan ghat ,muslimo ke kabristaan or chrischiyanon ke greveyard ke liye bajet main koi praavdhaan nahin hota, naa hi aisi koi parampara he
 After partition, the same rules and regulations are applicable in Chhattisgarh, which are effective in Madhya Pradesh
 rajya main gram panchayate, nagar panchayatein, nagar palika or nagar nigam paramparaagat shmashaan ghat , kabristaan or greveyard ke liye sirf sthaan chaynit karne main NOC jari karti he, jabaki inkaa vikaas sthaneey saamaajik sanghathan yaa phir kisi trust dwaara sanchalit hota he
 It has been 17 years since Chhattisgarh was formed, but whenever the budget was presented in the Legislative Assembly of the state, no amount was allocated for its maintenance or development
 is maamle main rajya ke rajasav mantri prem prakaash pandey kii daleel he ki rajya sarkaar maang aane par antim sanskaar sthal ke liye rajasav sweekrut karti he
 According to him, this subject is about local bodies
 sthaneey nikaay hi antim sanskaar sthal ke rakrakhaav or uske vikaas kii ruparekha taiyaar karte hai
 There is no part of the state, including Raipur to Bastar and Surguja divisions in Chhattisgarh, where the state government has provided any financial assistance for cremation grounds, cemeteries and graveyards
 sarkaar kii bhoomika in sthanon ke liye sirf sthal chayan tak simit rahi he
 For this, the state government allocates land through collectors
 basharte us bhoomi ke liye gaanv main gram or nagar panchayatein, shaharon main nagar palika or nagar nigam ne koi roda naa atakaya ho
 Obviously, these urban bodies issue a No Objection Certificate for the use of that land
 iske baad shmashanghat ke vyavastha kaa jimmaa hindu dharmik vyavastha ke anusaar sthaneey saamaajik or swayamsevi sansthaae , muslimo ke liye vakf board or chrischiyanon ke liye unke sthaneey diase karte hai
 All these institutions raise and maintain economic funds at their level
 rajya ke saamaajik or dharmik itihaas main abhi tak aisa koi mauqaa nahin aayaa he, jab shmashanghat] kabristaan or greveyard ke sthal chayan yaa phir uske rakh rakhaav or vistaar ke liye logon ne sarkaar kaa muh taaka ho

 There is no official talk in the Union Home Ministry but sources say that there will be talk about the extradition of Vijay Mallya and Lalit Modi during the visit of the Home Secretary of the country
 ek adhikari ne kaha ki "bharat lagaataar koshish kar rahaa he ki donon aaropee jald se jald bharat main kanoon ke saamne pesh hon

 The Indian Ministry of Home Affairs has become cautious on the issue raised by Vijay Mallya's lawyer

 republican party kii apni ummidavaari ko sweekaar karte hue apane bhaashan main trump ne kaha, ''maut, tabaahi or kamajori - yahi hillari clinton kii viraasat he
 
 
 The United States is more vulnerable today than before Obama's decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America's foreign policy, and the world is far more unstable
 
 
 mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki apane is nirnay par unhen vaaki afsos hoga
 
 
 Assessing Hillary's record, Trump said that until 2009 ISIS was nowhere in the map and the situation in West Asia was stable

 The Delhi High Court on Thursday pulled the authority for encroachment on the land of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and said that it is itself responsible for the situation
 court ne kaha ki didie ne is masale par aihtiyaati kadam nahin uthaae
 Justice VK Shali, while hearing the petition of the slum dwellers against the dda's decision to demolish the houses of a slum in Vasant Kunj, said, 'you should have taken precautionary action at the time the first encroachment occurred
 yah aapke dwaara khud banaai gai sthiti he
 'the court directed the DDA not to demolish the slum till presenting an affidavit
 didie ko is halafname main bataanaa hoga ki usne punarvaas ke liye yogya nivaasiyon kii pahchaan karne ke liye kshetra kaa surveykshan kiya yaa nahin
 The court ordered the DDA to state in an affidavit whether it had conducted the survey or not, what policy it had adopted in relation to the removal of the slum 'dalit Ekta Camp' and that it had taken up the issue of the court in 2010 regarding the removal of such slums
 Guidelines followed or not
 input-bhashaa Surrounded by scams and corruption, the government has been instructed by some well-known industrialists and personalities from other regions of the country
 sarkaar ko likhe ek khule khat main use apana kaamkaaz sudhaarney kii naseehat dete hue chaar ahm baaten kahi gai hai jin par sarkaar ko turant dhyaan dena chahie
 The letter states that the operations in every sector in the country have now become loose
 satta par baithe logon kii ye pehali zimmedaari he ki ve bharatiyon ke apane or apane desh main vishwaas ko kaayam karen
 According to the report, the country is suffering the most damage from corruption, which should be fought with full force immediately on a war footing
 khat main teesri baat ye kahi gai he ki janata ke numaayinde virodh or rukaawat daalane ke bich fark samajhen
 In this era of coalition, the representatives of the public should understand their responsibility
 ye bhi kaha gaya he ki vikaas kaa phayda desh ke garib logon tak nahin pahunch paa rahaa he
 The reason for this has been attributed to environmental concerns, which people at the state and central level do not have an opinion on
 khat main 14 jane-maane logon ke dastakhat hai jinamein azim premaji, keshav mahindra, deepak paarekh or dow
 Bimal Jalan etc

 The dearness allowance of central employees has been increased by 6 percent to 51 percent
 isse centre sarkaar ke kareeb 50 lakh karmchaaree or 38 lakh pensionbhogi labhanvit honge
 a Union Minister said, "it was decided to increase dearness allowance in the meeting of the Union Cabinet today
 yah vruddhi is saal ek janvari se prabhavi maani jaaegi
 5,715 annually on the exchequer due to increase in dearness allowance
 90 karod rupee kaa atirikt boj padegaa
 The increase in dearness allowance of government employees and pensioners will help them to cope with high inflation
 philhal mahangaai bhatta mul vetan kaa 45 fisad he
 6 percent increase in this is in accordance with the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission for Central employees
 is faisle se 50 lakh karmchaariyon or 38 lakh pensionbhogiyon ko laabh milegaa
 Dearness allowance is revised twice a year on January 1 and July 1
 ullekhneey he ki upabhokta mulya suchakank (audyogic karmchaaree) disambar main 9
 47 percent and 9 in January

 On the basis of this, the dearness allowance is amended
 thok mulya par aadhaarit sakal mudrasphiti farvari maheene main 8

 The BJP government of Rajasthan has decided to celebrate Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Jayanti by canceling holidays in educational institutions on the day of Bakrid
 shiksha vibhaag ke aadesh ke anusaar, 25 sitambar korajya sarkaarake college ke sabhi karmchaaree apane daftar aaenge
 On this day, blood camps will be organized in the name of Pandit Deendayal
 rajasthan sarkaar ke aadesh main likhaa he ki 25 sitambar ko rajya ke college shiksha ayog ke sansthaanon main pandit dinadayal kii jayanti manaai jaaegi, jisamen blad donneton camp yojit kiye jaaenge
 The issue is that Bakrid is also on this day on 25 September, whose holidays are already announced
 yah gajted holiday he, jo aazaadee ke pehle se chali aa rahi he
 In such a situation, the Muslim organizations are calling this day a well-planned conspiracy
 The biggest thing is that Bakrid is dependent on the sight of the moon, that is, on September 24 and 25, Bakrid can be held on any one day, while the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya is on September 25
 Is on aise main chitthee main 24 sitambar ko upasthit rahane ko kyon kaha gaya he? isi vajah se muslim sanghathan ise andeh kii najar se dekh rahe hai
 On the other hand, the Government of Rajasthan says that blood donation is a social work and Pandit Deendayal was a big leader, so one should not see politics in it
 muslim sanghathanon ne is masale par andolan karne ke saath-saath court main jane kii chetavanee di he
 In the past too, the Rajasthan government has been in controversies about making Surya Namaskar mandatory in educational institutions and abolishing the post of Urdu teacher
 bihar kii rahane vaali rashtriya mahila kabddi or kushti khilaadi rubi (badla hua naam) khel kii duniya main naam kamanaa chaahati he
 But due to caste envy in his village, now the domineering are not only asking him to quit the game, but he is being threatened with rape if he does not listen to them
 rubi patna se 40 kilometre dur mokama ke paas pandarak gaanv kii rahane vaali he
 For the past few months, the domineering of the area has been pressuring him to quit the game
 or aisa naa karne par useebalaatkaaraki dhamkee bhi di ja rahi he
 Ruby Yadav belongs to the society and is also a national level player of Kabaddi
 yahi baat uske gaanv ke oonchi bhoomihaar jati ke logon ko nagavar guzar rahi he
 Ruby had contacted the local police about 2 months ago and filed a complaint against the overbearing
 magar police ne us shikaayat par koi kaarywahi nahin kii
 Ruby says that she goes to the kabaddi practice 25 km from her village daily and the villagers of the village are threatening her that she will be raped if she does not stop playing kabaddi
 darasal, kuch maheenon pehle rubi ne kabddi ke ek toornament main bhoomihaar jati kii ek ladki ko haraa diya tha or tab se hi use dabangon dwaara pareshaan kiya ja rahaa he or samay-samay par chhedchhad bhi kii ja rahi he
 In this connection, Ruby reached Patna on Saturday and met SSP Manu Maharaj and lodged a complaint
 patna esaspi se shikaayat darj karaane ke baad rubi ne kaha ki vah kyonki yadav samaaj se aati he isiilie bhoomihaar samaaj ke logon use lagaataar pareshaan kar rahe hai or kabddi chhodane ke liye dabaav bana rahe hai
 The shocking thing is that SSP Manu Maharaj also admitted that Ruby had complained to the local police 2 months ago, but at that time the matter had been closed through negotiations
 magar uske baavjood dabangon ne rubi ko pareshaan karnaa band nahin kiya
 Patna SSP Manu Maharaj said that now he will immediately take action against the accused and his arrest will be ensured
 bhartiya janata party sarkaar ke pehle bajet kii rajnatik vishleshan kii do kasautiyaan hai—ek to avadharana or duusare use kriyanvit karne ke taur-tareeke
 Talking about the first criterion, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave political direction to his finance minister and railway minister at the beginning of the budget preparation
 aisa mana jaataa he ki modi ne saaf kah diya tha ki loklubhaavan upayon se bachaa jaae
 The gift of meaningless should not be distributed and full emphasis should be given to attract investment
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki unhone donon mantriyon ko puure rajnatik samarthan kaa bharosa dilaayaa tha
 It was clear from day one on the concept level that the government's economic vision would be right-wing
 uske baad taur-tareeke kaa sawaal aata he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's three warlords, Commerce Minister and Minister of State for Finance Nirmala Sitharaman, Power Minister Piyush Goyal and Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan regularly discussed the issues that were decided by the Prime Minister
 yah or baat he ki pradhanmantri kii suchi kaaphi lambii thi
 Sources say that the pressure for the FDI package started coming from the Prime Minister's Office
 guds or sarvice tex (jiesti) ke liye bhi vahiin se nirdesh aayaa tha
 Similarly, Modi was adamant on renewable and clean energy
 isiilie gujarat, rajasthan, tamilnadu or ladakh main bahut bade solar power project lagane or 15,000 kilometre lambii gas pipeline sarkari nijee bhagidaari (pipipi) main bichaane par jor he
 Modi's simple mantra for these schemes was that they would start profitable economic activities, generate employment and benefit small and medium entrepreneurs
 sari soch badhati apekshaaon ke anuroop shaharon or udyogon par kendrit thi
 a lot has been done in the budget in this direction, but this process became somewhat blunt as soon as the bureaucracy came under the grip of bureaucracy
 misaal ke taur par agar raksha kshetra main epadi seemaa badhaane kii baat karen to shuru main ise shat-pratishat tak le jane kaa lubhaavna prastaav tha, taaki technology puri tarah bharat main aa sake or bharat ke raksha udyog main gunatmak sudhaar ho sake
 But this proposal got embroiled in a well-known debate that had been going on since the UPA era
 bharat ke niyantran or suraksha jokhimon kii duhai di jane lagi
 The bureaucracy is believed to have imposed many hurdles and eventually the government had to choose the more traditional option of 49 per cent limit insisting on Indian control
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki upie ke mukaable maamuli sudhaar dekhne ko mila
 The UPA government had also approved 49 percent FDI with the condition of technology transfer
 ab bhi in prastaavon ko videshi nivesh sanvadrdhan board se guzarana padegaa
 Due to not having his core economic team, Jaitley had to depend on government officials, most of whom have been in existence since UPA
 sutron ne bataaya ki krantikari badlaav laane kii kisi bhi koshish ko palitha lagane main yah sabase ahm vajah lagati he
 The issue of tax collection from the previous date is also an example where initially the political intention was to eliminate it completely
 lekin yah iraadaa north block ke sarkari afasaron kii aapasi khinchataan main ulajhakar rah gaya or tex niyantran ke vakeelon ne puraane nots khodakar nikaal liye or vahi ghise-pite tark barasaa die
 The real quarrel was that when many countries resort to their right to tax from the old date, should the Indian government give up this right? If the answer is that even if the government does not use it, but the rights should be in their hands, then the question of closing old cases gets entangled on its own
 natijatan aise maamalon main samiti banane kaa afasarshahi samaadhaan saamne aayaa or vitt mantri yah safai dene par majaboor ho gaye ki aakhir yah sahi disha main uthaaya gaya kadam kaise he
 Sources say that the length of the budget speech also reflects the bureaucratic imprint on it
 bhaashan itnaa lanbaa tha ki jetali kii peeth main anthan ho gai or unhen bhaashan ko bich main rokane kaa asaamaanya anurodh karnaa padaa
 The Speaker had to stop the proceedings for five minutes
 is dauraan satta paksh ne anumati maangi ki vitt mantri baithkar apana bhaashan puraa karen
 Nevertheless, he remained restless
 unhen tab raahat mili jab videsh mantri kii salaah maanakar jhukkar padhgaye kii bajaae ve peeth tikaakar baith gaye
 P
 chidambaram kai dinon tak apane bhaashan kaa ek-ek shabd khud padhaa karte the
 But it is understood that Jaitley has adopted the style of delegating this work to others
 iske bhi apane phaayde hai
 But such a long and elaborate speech was held in his hand which took more than two hours to read
 pichley kuch varshon main shaayad yah sabase lanbaa bhaashan tha
 As finance minister, President Pranab Mukherjee used to give long budget speeches on his own
 haalanki arun jetali ne apane bajet bhaashan main kaviyon or shaayaron kaa sahaara lene kii parampara ko todaa he
 The irony is that the budget that was to become the turning point document of the government's policy for the entire team remained entangled in the argument that it was only a seven-month budget and that is why the government could not announce long-term measures
 iske natijatan iraade kaa sanket to anukool lagata he, phir bhi bhavishya ko lekar har koi yahi kehane par majaboor he ki “aage jaakar pataa chalegaa
 "on the political front, this budget has confirmed that the Modi government is fully conscious of not losing the credibility of its mandate and hence there is a tendency not to promise more than capacity under the pressure of huge expectations
" iskaa doosraa pahalu yah he ki bahut adhik mahatvakanksha nahin dikhaai detii
 The target of 7-8 percent growth rate in the first year of coming to power seems to be thought-out but nothing much is successful in awakening it
 sarakar main maujuud sutron ke anusaar, sarkaar kaa iraadaa bajet ke saath-saath lagaataar aise kadam uthaane rahane kaa he jinase niveshkon kii bhaawanaaon main badlaav aae
 Systems and processes will be improved for this
 masalan, audyogic niti or sanvadrdhan vibhaag niyamon main dheel dene par kaam kar rahaa he
 The rule now is that industries with more than 100 employees must seek government permission before any layoffs or lockouts
 ab yah shart 1,000 yaa usase adhik karmchaariyon vaale udyogon par lagane kii baat chal rahi he
 Similarly, an e-platform is being developed for starting new industries so that they can apply in one place and their proposal should be sent to the relevant departments for approval from there
 is sari prakriya par nishchit samay ke bheetar najar rakhi ja sakati he
 All these measures can get full political benefit when they are implemented effectively
 ab sara dhyaan isi par dena hoga
 Modi will have to show his political strength along with his habit of working with tight control over the bureaucracy
 agar aisa nahin hua to nek iraade or asardaar sandesh bhi bahes or pechidagiyon kii bhul-bhulaiya main khokar rah jaaenge
 The charge sheet for running the case in JNU sedition case has not been allowed by the Delhi government so far
 sarkaar ko mangalvaar tak anumati deni thi
 But now the court has clearly said that if the Delhi Police has evidence and videos, then we will take action even after the government does not get permission
 darasal, court ne dilli police kii special cell ko 28 farvari ko anumati lekar aane ko kaha tha
 Actually, till now the Delhi government has not got permission to run a case of treason against the accused in the JNU case
 jis par dilli police ne kaha ki dilli sarkaar ke home department ke paas file ataki he
 At the same time, the Delhi government's lawyer said that he has no knowledge in this matter
 sarkaar ko apane vivek se tay karnaa he ki anumati de yaa na de
 After this, the court asked what evidence is there against Kanhaiya
 is par police ne kaha ki video or forencik saboot hai, jisase pataa chalata he ki kanhaiya na sirf maukey par maujuud rahe, balki deshvirohi naare lagane waalon kaa samarthan kiya or unhen nahin roka
 On this, the court said that we will watch the video
 sarkaar parmishan na bhi de tab bhi ham video dekhakar karrwai karenge
 Now till March 11, the court will take further action after watching the video
 darasal, deshadroh maamle main dilli police ko dilli sarkaar ke anumati leni hoti he or yah dilli sarkaar kaa lau department detaa he
 Not only this, the file also goes to LG to get permission
 agar parmishan nahin mili to chargeshit par court sangyaan nahin legaa
 It is being told that the police applied for the permission on the same day the charge sheet was presented

 The issue of Jat reservation had started picking up since 26 March last year when the 70-member Jat delegation met Prime Minister Modi

 Although sources claim that Khattar had contacted BJP president Amit Shah over phone about this when the agitation was going on peacefully, but he received instructions that there should be no strictness with Jats till the UP elections

 Despite this, Khattar and his team — which included Finance Minister Captain Abhimanyu Sindhu and Agriculture Minister Om Prakash Dhankhar, only two Jat members within the eight-cabinet cabinet — could not gauge the size of the movement

 ve kehete hai, ''is baar naujavaanon ne jat netaaon kii sunne se inkaar kar diya, jin par vastav main duusari jatiyon ke aarakshan kaa asar padaa he
 Sangwan says that eventually this movement became leaderless and was captured by anti-social elements "who cannot claim to be from any particular caste
" ''adhiktar jat netaa is baat se sahamat hai ki chaahe sajishan yaa apni susti ke chalate khatter kurukshetra ke saansad rajkumaar saini par lagaam kasne main naakaam rahe

 In such a situation, the internal pull of BJP is also being said to be the reason behind the movement
