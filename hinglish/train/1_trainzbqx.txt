 At the same time, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also showed strong attitude in Kolkata
 trinmul congress kii pramukh mamata banerjee ne guuruuvaar ko kaha tha ki agar bijepi main himmat he to vah siee or enarasi par sanyukt raashtra (UN) kii nigaraanee main janamat sangrah karaae
 Mamta Banerjee said that after the referendum, let's see who wins
 centre kii modi sarkaar ko chunauti dete hue mamata ne aage kaha ki agar tum haarate ho to tumhen istipha dekar janaa hoga
 Meanwhile, Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankar has urged Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to withdraw the UN Citizenship Amendment statement on the Citizenship Amendment Act and NRC
 rajyapal dhankhad ne twit kar kaha ki desh ke naagarik ke rup main ve banerjee ke bayaan se kaaphi dukhi or aahat hai
 He said that he hopes that the Chief Minister will definitely heed his request as no one should compromise with nationalism
 In the name of our Founding Fathers i fervently appeal to her to act as per her oath and regretfully withdraw her statement
 As a senior leader and constitutional functionary she cannot be oblivious to the potentially dangerous consequences of such approach
 — Jagdeep Dhankhar (@jdhankhar1)december 20, 2019rajyapal jagadeep dhankhad ne apane twit main likhaa, main siem mamata banerjee se apil karata hum ki kripaya apane bayaan ko waapas len
 The United Nations or National Human Rights Commission is an impartial organization and Mamata Banerjee needs to say that how many people are in favor of it and how many are in opposition
 hamen kabhi bhi apane rashtrawaad se samjhauta nahin karnaa chahie
 The nation is paramount and we are sure that CM Mamata Banerjee will heed my humble request and withdraw her statement
 kitna uchit he mamata kii refrendom kii mangabaharhaal, janamat sangrah (refrendom) yani raishumaari
 Meaning to seek public opinion
 haal hi main dekha gaya tha ki england ne europea sangh se alag hone (bracit) ke liye logon kii raishumaari kii thi
 People express opinions by expressing their consent or disagreement
 mamata banerjee bhi naagarikta ke mudde par aisi raishumaari kii maang kar rahi hai
 The question is how reasonable it is for Mamata Banerjee to demand a plebiscite in India on the issue of citizenship
 raajnneetik vishleshak or emity uniwarsity, noida main assitant professor shrish pathak is maamle par mamata banerjee kii maang se ittefaq nahin rakhte hai
 Shrish Pathak says, 'mamta Banerjee is saying an extraordinary thing in excitement
 unki yah baat samprubhta ke khilaaf he
 This is our internal matter
 unhen ek mukhyamantri ke taur par kabhi aisi baat nahin kehani chahie
 'on the question whether there can be a referendum under the supervision of the United Nations? Shrish Pathak says that this can be possible, but the question is why we will take this issue there
 hamen is mudde kaa antarrashtriyakaran nahin karnaa chahie balki mamata banerjee ko yah maang kerani chahie ki is masale par sabhi rajyon kii turant baithak bulaai jaae
 Shrish Pathak says that this is not a legitimate demand on this occasion also because there is no awareness about it in public right now

 Uttarakhand is also known as Devbhoomi
 yahaan har gali-kuche main mandiron kii bharmaar he
 According to Hindu religion, there are 33 crore deities, but in Uttarakhand, this number increases even more, because there is recognition of Bhumia Devta to Gwal Devta, Gram Devta and Kul Devta here
 ye wo jameen he, jahaan mahabharat ke 'khalanaayak' duryodhana or daanveer karn ko bhi puja jaataa he
 Yes, Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand has temples of Duryodhana and Karna
 duryodhana kaa mandir yahaan ke netwar naamak jagah se kareeb 12 kimi dur ‘har kii doon’ road par sthit saura gaanv main he
 Chakrata is about 95 km from Dehradun and Netwar village is about 69 km from Chakrata
 jabaki karn mandir netwar se kareeb dedh mile dur sarnaul gaanv main he
 This land of Sarnaul and Saura village is the land of a great warrior named Bhubruvahana
 manyata he ki patallok kaa raja bhubruvahan dwaparayug main kauravon or pandavon ke bich mahabharat yuddh kaa hissaa bananaa chahta tha
 He came to earth with this desire in mind, but Lord Krishna cleverly drove him away from the war
 bhubruvahan kauravon kii taraf se yuddh main shaamil hona chahta tha or krishna ko andeshaa tha ki bhubruvahan arjuna ko chunauti de saktaa he
 So he gave Bhubruvahana a challenge
 krishna ne bhubruvahan ko ek hi tir se ek ped ke sabhi patton ko chhedne kii chunauti di, is bich krishna ne ek patta todakar apane pair ke neeche dabaa liya
 Bhubruvahana's arrow was moving towards Krishna's feet after piercing all the leaves on the tree, when he removed his leg
 krishna kisi bhi tarah bhubruvahan ko yuddh se dur rakhana chaahate the or unhone use nishpaksh rahane ko kaha
 Being neutral meant staying away from war and no warrior was allowed to stay away from the war of Mahabharata, so Krishna found a way to overcome Bhubruvahana
 unhone kisi tarah bhubruvahan kaa sir uske dhad se alag kar diya
 a sketch of Karna's temple, taken from the Uttarakhand government's website, though Krishna beheaded Bhubruvahan before the war started, but he expressed a desire to see war and Lord Krishna fulfilled his wish
 unhone bhubruvahan ke sir ko yahaan ek ped par taang diya or usne yaheen se mahabharat kaa puraa yuddh dekha
 Locals say that whenever the strategy of the Kauravas failed in the war of Mahabharata, whenever they had to face defeat, Bhubruvahan shouted loudly and asked them to change the strategy
 wo rota tha or aaj bhi ro rahaa he
 It is also believed that the river named Tamas or Tons has formed from these tears of Bhubruvahana
 yahi kaaran he ki aaj bhi is nadi kaa pani koi nahin peetaa
 Both Duryodhana and Karna were big fans of Bhubruvahana
 yahaan ke sthaneey log ab bhi uski veerta ko salaam karte hai or uski prashansa main geet gaae jate hai
 People here have built temples of Karna and Duryodhana, friends of Bhubruvahana
 duryodhana kaa mandir saura gaanv main, jabaki karn kaa mandir sarnaul gaanv main he

 It was good for me australia ke khilaaf melbern main khele ja rahe tisare test ke duusare din(match report) ke khel ke baad bharat driving seat par he
 India declared 443 for 7 wickets in their first innings
 or australian openron ko acha-khaasaa asahaj bhi karaayaa
 But former Kangaroo captain Ricky Ponting has said very strangely
 ponting ne kaha he ki bharat melbern test haar saktaa he
 While the entire cricket world is appreciating Cheteshwar Pujara's innings, the former captain said that India can only lose due to Pujara's innings
 Cheteshwar Pujara's 106 and fifties from Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma power India to 443 / 7d on Day 2 of the third Test
 Can they press their advantage tomorrow? # ausvind REPORT https: / / t

 com / el6jc1tdjibarawa kii pehali pari main jahaan captain viraat kohli ne 204 gendon par 82 ran kii pari kheli, to pujaara ne 319 gendon par 10 chaukon se 106 ran banaae
 Pujara remained on the pitch during the hundred overs
 aakhri main pat kamins ne pujaara kii pari kaa ant kiya
 Pujara bowled at a very low ball
 or kuch der baad ek nichi rahati gend par aisa hi haal ajinkya rahane kaa bhi hua
 And the dismissal of these two clearly indicated how the pitch is going to behave in the next few days
 pujaara ne captain viraat kohli ke saath milakar 170 ran kii saajhedaari karte hue australia ko baikfoot par dhakel diya
 But Ponting has criticized Pujara's style
 ponting ne yah kehane se bhi gurej nahin kiya pujaara kii yah pari bharat ke match ko ganvaane kaa kaaran bhi ban sakati he
 Ponting said that during his batting, Pujara did not show concern for scoring runs
 ponting ne kaha ki agar bharat yahaan se match jeetta he, to pujaara kii is pari ko mahaan pariyon main shumaar kiya jayega
 Ponting further said that if India did not get enough time to dismiss Australia twice, then the reason for losing the match would be Pujara's innings
 unhone kaha ki pujaara ne do shatak banaae hai
 And he does not appear to be out, but during this time his attitude is such that where the run is not discouraged at all
 purv captain ne kaha ki bharat ke paas achche stroke lagane vaale ballebaaj hai, lekin agar ve tej nahin khelte hai, to ausat kareeb do ran prati over hone ja rahaa he
 And this is not good for Test cricket
 mujhe lagata he ki pujaara ke pich par rahete bharat ke liye acha ausat nikaalnaa hameshaa hi mushkil rahaa he
 Anurag Thakur, former 'boss' of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), has a very clear opinion on the issue of controversies between Indian team captain Virat Kohli and former head coach Anil Kumble
 anuraag kaa maananaa he ki team captain kii hoti he or isi kaaran sahi myne main 'bos' use hi hona chahie
 Following the orders of the Supreme Court, today Anurag has been confined to the post of the President of Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) but the opinion of the current President of Himachal Pradesh Olympic Association and BJP MP Anurag on the disputes between the captain and the coach is absolutely is clear
 yahaan anuraag thakur kaa bayaan isliye chaunkaane vaala he, kyonki anil kumble ko team india kaa coach us vakt niyukt kiya tha, jab anuraag thakur bisisiai ke chairman the
 Also, following the Supreme Court's order, Anurag Thakur formed a three-member committee comprising Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman for coach selection
 isi cameti ne anil kumble ke naam par muhar lagaai thi
 Anurag, who is overseeing the Himachal Pradesh Olympic Games released here, said that the pressure between Kumble and Virat put more pressure on Virat
 unhone kaha, viraat ke upar bina baat kaa dawaab kyon banaaya ja rahaa he? viraat ko in sab baton ko lekar nishaanaa bananaa sahi nahin he kyonki yah pehali baar nahin hua he
 The first Greg Chappell was also removed
 yah har samay hi hua he ki captain hi zyada ahm he, chayansmiti main bhi kyonki aakhirkaar team captain ko hi khilaani he
 See the history till date in India, you do not have a player bigger than Virat
 agle 10 saal aapako desh kii cricket isi str par yaa isse aage le jaani he to aapako viraat jaisaa doot chahie
 It is noteworthy that recently Kumble resigned as the head coach of the Indian team after admitting to the differences with Virat
 unka qaraar champiens trophy tak ke liye hi tha lekin bisisiai ne ise westeindies daure tak ke liye badha diya tha lekin vah england se sidhe swadesh laut aae
 After this, many former players had said that Virat has become the boss in Indian cricket, which should not happen
 anuraag jab bisisiai ke adhyaksh the, tab kumble ko coach pad par niyukt kiya gaya tha

 Today those who are sitting should question why such things come out
 is maamle main meri raay bilkul spasht he
 Virat needs to be the boss
 viraat bos hai
 (virat should be the boss, Virat must be the boss, and Virat is the boss)
 vah team ke captain hai or isi kaaran unhen hi bos hona chahie
 "comments coach pad ke bare main thakur ne kaha, "coach kaa apana ek sthaan he, lekin team ke 11 khilaadiyon ko maidan par captain ko khilaanaa he, isiilie praathamikta usee kii baton or jaruraton ko diya janaa chahie
 " input: IANS Anurag, who is overseeing the Himachal Pradesh Olympic Games released here, said that the pressure was put on Virat in Viva The, which took place between Kumble and Virat 
 unhone kaha, viraat ke upar bina baat kaa dawaab kyon banaaya ja rahaa he? viraat ko in sab baton ko lekar nishaanaa bananaa sahi nahin he kyonki yah pehali baar nahin hua he
 The first Greg Chappell was also removed
 yah har samay hi hua he ki captain hi zyada ahm he, chayansmiti main bhi kyonki aakhirkaar team captain ko hi khilaani he
 See the history till date in India, you do not have a player bigger than Virat
 agle 10 saal aapako desh kii cricket isi str par yaa isse aage le jaani he to aapako viraat jaisaa doot chahie
 It is noteworthy that recently Kumble resigned as the head coach of the Indian team after admitting to the differences with Virat

 " input: IANS He said, why is pressure being made on Virat without talking? It is not right to target Virat with all these things because it has not happened for the first time
 pehle greg chapel ko bhi hataaya gaya
 It has happened all the time that the captain is more important, even in the selection committee because ultimately the team has to feed the captain
 bharat main bhi aaj tak kaa itihaas dekhie aapke paas viraat se bada khilaadi nahin he
 For the next 10 years, if you want to take the country's cricket to this level or beyond, then you need a messenger like Virat

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh gave the mantra of victory to Pakistan ahead of the big match against Pakistan on Sunday
 haalanki, unhone jo sharten rakhin unhen puraa karnaa pakistan kii team ke liye mushkil hi nahin, naammumkin hoga
 Actually, in a video chat, Shoaib Akhtar asked Harbhajan Singh what Pakistan should do so that it can win over India
 iske jawaab main harbhajan ne hansate hue kaha, 'pakistan kii team main younis khan ko le aao, injamaam ul haq ko le aao or said anwar ko bhi waapas le aao, tab jaakar kuch behatar ho saktaa he
 'please tell that these three Pakistani players have retired
 aise main harbhajan singh kaa 'guru mantra' pakistan ke kaam nahin aa saktaa
 Speaking on the weakness of the Pakistani team, Bhajji said that the current team could not withstand the pressure
 betuka shot markar khilaadi out ho jate hai
 However, he also praised Babar Azam and said that he is a good player, Imam is also a good player
 saath hi harbhajan ne kaha ki jo galtiyaan younis khan or injamaam nahin karte the, waisi hi ballebaaji pakistani team ke khilaadiyon ko seekhni hogi
 Harbhajan said that there is no shortage of talent in the Pakistani team
 lekin ye galat shot khel jate hai
 He said that Team India captain Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are better because they do not play absurd shots
 unhen pataa hota he ki agar chaukaa maarna he to kahaan maarna he or kis gend par maarna he
 Harbhajan Singh said that if Pakistan's team plays long then something can be better
 saath hi unhone kaha ki pakistan agar toss jeet jaataa he to use pehle ballebaaji kerani chahie
 Because there will be no pressure on the team
 pakistan ko 270 kaa target lekar chalanaa chahie
 This is also the formula for Team India

 The comments maamla he chini maanjhe kaa jisaki vajah se dilli main chaar logon kii jaan chali gai

 loksabhaa chunaav ke maddenjar yah tay ho gaya ki ab dilli main aam aadmi party or congress ke bich kisi tarah kaa gathbandhan nahin hoga
 After an hour-long meeting of Delhi Congress leaders with Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday, Delhi Congress President Sheila Dikshit clearly stated that there will be no alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party and Rahul Gandhi has also accepted it
 aam aadmi party gathbandhan ke liye lalayit thi
 The head of the Aam Aadmi Party itself and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had even said publicly that we are tired of refusing the Congress but the Congress is not agreeing to the alliance
 jabaki congress bhi yah maanati he ki dilli main vah akele bijepi ko nahin haraa sakati or aam aadmi party congress ke alag-alag ladane se vot bantenge jiskaa sidhaa phayda bijepi ko hoga
 Despite this, if the Congress has refused to ally, then there are five possible reasons
 dilli congress ke netaaon kaa maananaa he ki congress ne jab jab kisi rajya main kshetreey partiyon ke saath gathbandhan kiya tab tab party vahaan or neeche chali gai or haalat yah hui ki jahaan par congress party ecchhatra raaj kiya karti thi vahaan party keval ek pichhalggu party banakar rah gai
 Such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
 isliye dilli congress ke netaa shuru se aam aadmi party se gathbandhan ke khilaaf rahe
 The Aam Aadmi Party is also desperate for an alliance with the Congress because the Lok Sabha election is to make the Prime Minister
 isliye aam aadmi party ko lag rahaa he ki shaayad janata is baar uske paksh main naa jaae kyonki kisi bhi surat main pradhanmantri aam aadmi party kaa to ho nahin saktaa
 Therefore, she wants to form an alliance with the Congress because according to Delhi, the Prime Minister will be made either from BJP or from Congress
 aise main aam aadmi party congress ke sahare is loksabhaa chunaav ke liye apane aap ko rashtriya paripeksh main banaae rakhana chaahati he
 While the Aam Aadmi Party believes that when the Assembly elections are held in Delhi, it will have a CM candidate like Arvind Kejriwal, whose name is re-elected by the public in the name of 5 years of work and therefore the Aam Aadmi Party will not need the Congress as much in the assembly elections Lok Sabha is in the election
 lekin agar aam aadmi party loksabhaa chunaav main acha nahin kar pai to uske bare main yah dharna banegi ki dilli ke logon ke man se ab aam aadmi party utar rahi he or iskaa khamiyaja usko vidhansabha chunaav main uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 The Congress understands this, so it flatly refuses the alliance

 Do not stop the train at Khatu station in Rajasthan, let the loco pilot become so expensive that the railways have punished both of them for running only the engines for life
 darasal, 25 farvari ko train sankhya 22481 jodhpur se ravaanaa hui thi

 Therefore, before the arrival of the station, the responsibility of slowing the train to stop at the station lies with the loco pilot and assistant loco pilot, but both of them crossed the speed of 100 instead of stopping the train

 In such a situation, parents have to face a lot of trouble
 agar aap apane bachche ko buree najar se dur rakhana chaahate hai to apanaaen ye upaay
 
 
 1
 bachche ko apane haath se khaanaa parosna chahie
 Food served by your hand will be applied to his body in the same way as mother's milk is used in childhood
 2
 At night, place a lota or glass of water on the right side of the child's head
 isse raat ko sote samay kuvichaar uske mastik par koi asar nahin kar paaenge
 Know, which trees will get promotion in the job by worshiping
 
 
 3
 When the child is awake, be present with him
 yadi baccha jagane par aapako dekhtaa he to din bhar aapaki tasviir ko vah apane dimag main rakhega
 When Lord Shiva broke the teeth of Pushan Dev
 
 
 4
 Children also get the eye of the family
 isliye shaam ko baccha jab bistar par sone jaaen to ek pathar ko bachche ke chaaron taraf ghumaa kar pani se dhokar ek niyat sthaan par rakh dena chahie
 On the day it looks dangerous or if some disease is disturbing, then that stone will not be found in its place or broken
 sadiyon se bachche classroom main sikhte rahe hai, lekin technology ne classroom ko puri tarah se badal daalaa he
 Today our way of reading has completely changed due to modern technology
 paaramparik blike board kii jagah aaj smartboard, tablet or i-book ne le lee he
 It would not be wrong to say that the old classrooms have completely changed today
 is badlaav ke maddenjar jaruri he ki ham classroom main aadhunik takneekon kaa istemaal jari rakhen
 New techno logics such as virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality have created interactive space for classroom learning
 classroom main imarsive larnig takneekon kaa istemaal kiye jane ke kai kaaran hai
 Virtual Reality can change the way students learn
 sirf pregnancy hi nahin, periods miss hone ke or bhi hai karanek aise parivesh kii kalpana karen, jahaan chaatr kaksha main potential or kynetic energy kii avdhaaran samaj rahe hai, iske liye roller coster ride kaa udhaaharan liya gaya he, aise maamalon main taj mahal ke virtual ajukeshan field timp kaa udhaaharan bhi liya ja saktaa he
 The inclusion of immersive technology in the classroom not only makes learning interesting, but also allows students to understand difficult concepts easily
 virtual rielti larnig main aane vaali sabhi baadhaon ko dur karti he or chaatro ko vyaavhaarik larnig kaa mauka pradaan karti he, jo vastav main classroom spes ke daayre se baahar seekhney kaa sarvshereshth tarika hota he
 On the other hand, through virtual reality, students imagine things in the same way that their teachers expect
 is tarah chaatro main rachanaatmakataa ko badhaava miltaa he
 They try to learn the real situation by imagining it
 technology aaj bhi badal rahi he
 In such a situation, it is important to pay attention to many important things before applying immersive technology in the classroom
 virtual rielti chaatro ko bahari duniya se jod rahi he
 In such a situation, it is important to pay attention to what the students are learning in an immersive environment
 pregnancy main nahin chaahati hai koi samasya to naa khaaen ye chigenchatro ko utkrisht anubhav pradaan karne ke liye gunvatttapurna virtual rielti contint banaaya janaa chahie
 It is not enough to make good content, it is a big challenge to implement it in the classroom
 portable viaar labs bade hi rochak tareeke se viaar technology ko classroom main shaamil karti he, isse jahaan ek ore skool main buniyadi suvidhaon or sansadhano kii laagat kam ho jaati he, vahiin duusari ore chaatro ke liye avadharna ko siikhnaa behad vyaavhaarik ho jaataa he
 Until recently, the price and design of a headset was a major challenge that came in the way of adopting VR in schools
 lekin ab yah laagat itani kam ho gai he ki iskaa istemaal aasaani se kiya ja saktaa he
 Also, it would be impractical to expect students to connect with pcs by wearing heavy, oversized VR headsets and enjoy their VR lessons
 hamen ol-in-van mobile viaar hedset kii aavashyaktaa he jo uparokt samasya kaa samaadhaan kar sake or practical handeld controlar dwaara larnig ko interactive banaaya ja sake
 Apart from this, it is also necessary to create awareness about virtual reality among students, teachers, schools, parents and all other stakeholders
 unhen yah jaankaree honi chahie ki kaise virtual rielti classroom main chaatro ke seekhney ke tareeke main badlaav laa sakati he
 It is also necessary to remove the misconceptions associated with it, such as technology can replace the teacher, which is completely wrong
 virtual rielti ek supplementary tul he jo adhyayan or adhyaapan kii gunvattta badhaata he
 The day is not far when the concept of both teacher and school can change
 (lekhika 'viative labs' kii senior ajukeshan cancelatent hai) a high profile case of defamation filed by the country's Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is going on in the High Court of Delhi
 yah cese arun jetali ne aam aadmi party ke sanyojak or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal or party ke anya chaar netaaon ke khilaaf daayar kiya he
 Arvind Kejriwal accused Arun Jaitley of corruption during his tenure in the DDCA and continued to accuse him of scam of several hundred crores from various forums
 bina saboot lagaataar aarope lagane par arun jetali ne unhen pehle to manahani kaa cese karne kii chetavanee di
 Arvind Kejriwal and team took this warning as a threat and presented a challenge that if they go to court there will automatically reveal the truth of the allegations related to the case
 centre kii narendra modi sarkaar main vittamantri arun jetali ne is chunauti kaa sweekaar kiya or court main manahani kaa mukadmaa daayar kar diya he
 Now the case is going on for the last several months
 arvind kejariwal kii ore se desh ke jane maane vakil ram jethmalani ne cese main pairvi kar rahe hai
 It is believed that Ram Jethmalani and Arun Jaitley had a heated debate in the whole case
 maamla ek yah bhi nikalakar saamne aayaa ki jo ram jethmalani is cese ko free main ladane kii baat kar rahe the un desh ke sabase mahange vakil ke liye dilli kii arvind kejariwal sarkaar ne karodon kii fees dene kaa jugad nikaal liya tha
 But the matter got stuck with the governor
 ab arvind kejariwal dilli ke mukhyamantri ke taur par is cese main ladaai ladane ke baat kah rahe hai
 Whatever the case may be, Thursday's court hearing took a new turn when Arjit Jaitley's Rajiv Nair and Sanjeev Sethi, arguing on behalf of Arun Jaitley, asked a question that could exacerbate Arvind Kejriwal's difficulties
 maamla kuch yun bhi ho saktaa he ki arvind kejariwal jo pehle hi 10 karod ke manahani ke maamle kaa cese lard rahe hai unhen ek or 10 karod kaa cese ladanaa na pad jaae
 During yesterday's hearing, the court termed many remarks made by Arvind Kejriwal's lawyer Ram Jethmalani in court on Arun Jaitley as defamatory
 court ne kaha ki agar is prakaar kii bhashaa kaa prayog karne ke liye arvind kejariwal kii ore se kaha gaya he tab is maamle main bahes ko aage lene jane kaa koi phayda nahin he
 For information, let us know that yesterday's hearing was held on an appeal by Raghav Chadha in which Arun Jaitley's lawyers took up the case
 jaj manmohan ne kaha ki aise main pehle kejariwal ko aakar apane aaropon par bayaan dena chahie
 This whole matter came to light when the lawyers appearing for Arun Jaitley's arguments told the court that it should be clear first that the language which Ram Jethmalani is using is being agreed with the consent of Arvind Kejriwal
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki ram jethmalani yah kah chuke hai ki vah jo kah rahe hai wo arvind kejariwal kii taraf se kah rahe hai
 Jaitley's lawyers said that if Arvind Kejriwal has given permission to use such language against Arun Jaitley, then another 10 crore defamation case will be filed
 iske baad jaj manmohan ne latad lagaate hue saaf kaha ki jab pehle hi manahani kaa cese chal rahaa he tab is prakaar se bhashaa kaa prayog kar kisi kaa apmaan nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 In the court, the judge said that if the same thing happened in a rape case, it would have amounted to torture of the victim
 iske baad court ne kaha ki peedit ke vakil is maamle main doosraa cese bhi kar sakate hai
 Explain that while cross-examining Arun Jaitley in front of the joint registrar of the court, Ram Jethmalani used the word crook (deceiver)
 iske baad jetali or jethmalani main tikhi bahes hui
 Both the team of lawyers had a heated debate and had to postpone the case further
 tippaniyan The court has issued a notice in this case and called Kejriwal for clarification
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki kejariwal ke edwocket ne on record ne court main saaf kah diya he ki is maamle main kejariwal kii ore se is prakaar ke shabdon ke prayog ke liye nahin kaha gaya he
 Whereas Ram Jethmalani has said in the court that he has received permission from Kejriwal for such cross examination
 iskaa sahi khulaasa ab kejariwal ke court ke court main bayaan ke baad hi ho paaegaa
 On the other hand, a legal screw in the case is also implicated whether the use of such language in court can be done or not
 abhi is par kuch bhi saaf nahin he
 It is so certain that if the matter of Ram Jethmalani comes true, Kejriwal will face another case and if it turns out wrong, Jethmalani has violated the rules of the lawyers
 centre kii narendra modi sarkaar main vittamantri arun jetali ne is chunauti kaa sweekaar kiya or court main manahani kaa mukadmaa daayar kar diya he

 iske baad jaj manmohan ne latad lagaate hue saaf kaha ki jab pehle hi manahani kaa cese chal rahaa he tab is prakaar se bhashaa kaa prayog kar kisi kaa apmaan nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 In the court, the judge said that if the same thing happened in a rape case, it would have amounted to torture of the victim
 iske baad court ne kaha ki peedit ke vakil is maamle main doosraa cese bhi kar sakate hai
 Explain that while cross-examining Arun Jaitley in front of the joint registrar of the court, Ram Jethmalani used the word crook (deceiver)
 iske baad jetali or jethmalani main tikhi bahes hui
 Both the team of lawyers had a heated debate and had to postpone the case further
 tippaniyan The court has issued a notice in this case and called Kejriwal for clarification
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki kejariwal ke edwocket ne on record ne court main saaf kah diya he ki is maamle main kejariwal kii ore se is prakaar ke shabdon ke prayog ke liye nahin kaha gaya he
 Whereas Ram Jethmalani has said in the court that he has received permission from Kejriwal for such cross examination
 iskaa sahi khulaasa ab kejariwal ke court ke court main bayaan ke baad hi ho paaegaa
 On the other hand, a legal screw in the case is also implicated whether the use of such language in court can be done or not
 abhi is par kuch bhi saaf nahin he
 It is so certain that if the matter of Ram Jethmalani comes true, Kejriwal will face another case and if it turns out wrong, Jethmalani has violated the rules of the lawyers
 puure maamle main mana ja rahaa he ki ram jethmalani or arun jetali main tikhi bahes hui
 The case also came out in one case that the Arvind Kejriwal government of Delhi had paid a bill of crores for the most expensive lawyer of the country, Ram Jethmalani, who was talking about fighting this case for free
 lekin maamla rajyapal ke paas jaakar atak gaya
 Now Arvind Kejriwal as the Chief Minister of Delhi is talking about fighting in this case
 khayr maamla jo bhi ho, guuruuvaar kii court kii sunwaayee main us samay ek nayaa mode aa gaya jab arun jetali kii ore se bahes kar rahe rajeev nair or sanjeev sethi ne ek aisa prashn puch liya jisase arvind kejariwal kii mushkilen or bad sakati hai
 The matter may also be such that Arvind Kejriwal, who is already fighting a case of defamation of 10 crores, may not have to fight another 10 crores case
 kal kii sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne arvind kejariwal ke vakil ram jethmalani kii court main arun jetali par kii gai kai tippaniyon ko nindaatmak qaraar diya
 The court said that if Arvind Kejriwal has been asked to use this type of language, then there is no use to take the debate further in this matter
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki kal kii sunwaayee raghav chaddha kii ek apil par hui thi jisamen arun jetali ke vakeelon ne yah maamla uthaaya
 Judge Manmohan said that in such a situation, Kejriwal should first come and give a statement on his allegations
 yah puraa maamla tab prakaash main jab arun jetali kii ore se bahes ke liye aae vakeelon ne court se kaha ki pehle yah saaf ho janaa chahie ki jis bhashaa kaa prayog ram jethmalani kar rahe hai kya vah arvind kejariwal kii sahmati se ho rahaa he
 He also said that Ram Jethmalani has said that what he is saying he is saying on behalf of Arvind Kejriwal
 jetali ke vakeelon ne kaha ki arvind kejariwal ne agar aisi bhashaa kaa prayog karne kii ijaajat arun jetali ke khilaaf di he to phir ek or 10 karod kaa manahani kaa cese daayar kiya jayega
 After this, Judge Manmohan lashed out and said that when defamation case is already going on, no one can be insulted by using language in this way
 court main jaj ne kaha ki agar aisa hi kisi rape ke cese main hua hota to yah peedit ke pratadna ke baraabar hota
 After this, the court said that the lawyer of the victim can also do a second case in this case
 bataa den ki court ke sanyukt register ke saamne arun jetali kaa cross-ikjamination karte hue ram jethmalani ne crook (dhokheybaaj) shabd kaa prayog kiya tha
 This was followed by a heated debate between Jaitley and Jethmalani
 donon kii vakeelon kii team main bhi tikhi bahes hui maamle ko aage ke liye taalna padaa he
 The comments court ne is maamle main notice jari kar kejariwal ko safai dene ke liye bulaayaa he
 For information, let us know that Kejriwal's Advocate on record has clearly stated in the court that Kejriwal has not been asked to use such words in this case
 jabaki ram jethmalani ne court main kaha he ki is prakaar ke cross ikjamination ke liye unhen kejariwal se ijaajat mili he
 The correct disclosure of this will now be done only after Kejriwal's statement in court
 udhar, maamle main ek kanoonee pench yah bhi fansaa he ki kya court main hue is prakaar kii bhashaa ke istemaal par cese kiya ja saktaa he yaa nahin
 Nothing is clear on this yet
 itnaa jarur he ki ram jethmalani kii baat yadi sahi nikali to kejariwal ek or cese jhelenge or agar galat nikali to jethmalani ne vakeelon ke niyamon kaa ulanghan kiya he

 unhen 2001 main akaal takht kaa jatthedaar banaaya gaya tha

 According to Vedanti, two big leaders of the SGPC, Rajinder Singh Mehta and Sukhdev Singh Bhaur, forced themselves to resign
 joginder singh vedanti se istifa lene ke peeche kai vajahen bataai ja rahi hai
 One made a statement in favor of the Khalistan in the US, and during the political ruckus over the nuclear deal, Vedanti favored Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, supporting the deal
 congress vedanti ke istife ko punjab ke liye nuksandeh bataa rahi he
 His differences with SGPC chairman Avtar Singh Makkar are also being attributed to Vedanti's resignation

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter hindi akhbaaron ke sampadakon ne apane pathakon kii hatya kaa plan bana liya he
 Newspapers are turning into garbage piles
 hindi ke akhbaar ab zyaadaatar propeganda kaa hi saamaan dhote nazar aate hai
 In the last four and a half years, no major news came out from Hindi newspapers or channels
 sahitya kii kitabon se churaai gai bidambnaaon kii bhashaa or rupakon ke sahare hindi ke patrkaar pathakon kii nigaah se batch kar nikal jate hai
 Is not news
 keval bhashaa kaa khel he
 After all, when the matter is constantly investigated to find the news and print on the front page, then why does the Hindi journalist not see it? It is not that he does not have news, his merit is less than anyone, but the owners and slave editors of newspapers blunt his edge
 kya aapkaa hindi akhbaar yaa channel alok verma ke maamle kii khud se padtaal kar rahaa he?aadhi raat se pehle hai power cameti baithti he
 Alok Verma is removed
 supreme court ke mukhya nyaayadhish ranjan gogoi us cameti se khud ko alag kar lete hai
 On the basis that he wrote the decision
 magar us cameti main pradhanmantri baith jate hai
 While the needle of suspicion is on them that they can suppress the Rafal case to save themselves and Ambani
 kaayade se pradhanmantri ko bhi is cameti se alag ho janaa chahie tha
 Should have said that the Supreme Court should decide so that the public does not have doubts
 jis sivisi kii report ke aadhaar par faisla hua, us par supreme court bhi faisla le sakati thi
 Rohini Singh's revelation in The Wire is even more serious
 rohinee singh ne likhaa he ki kendriya satarkta ayukta ke ve choudhary alok verma ke ghar gaye the
 Chaudhary wanted Alok Verma to withdraw his complaint against Rakesh Asthana
 alok verma ne yah baat justise patnayak ko likhakar di thi
 When Rakesh Asthana accused Verma, the Supreme Court tasked Justice Patnaik to investigate the allegations against Verma
 rohinee singh kii khabar kaa abhi tak sivisi choudhary ne khandan tak nahin kiya he
 Think this situation has happened
 rohinee singh ne likhaa he ki alok verma pradhanmantri karyaalay ke ek afasar bhaskar kulbe par mukadmaa daayar karne kaa faisla lene vaale the
 Bhaskar wanted to investigate the role of Kulbe in the coal scam
 rakesh asthana iskaa virodh kar rahe the
 a fight broke out in Verma and Asthana about this
 supreme court ke aadesh ke baad jab 36 ghante ke liye bahaali hui tab alok verma ne bhaskar kulbe ke kilaaf faisla le liya magar unke hatane ke baad nae kaaryvahak nideshak ne verma ke saare faisle palat die
 Rohini Singh writes that Central Vigilance Commissioner KV Chaudhary also hid from the Supreme Court that he had gone to Alok Verma's house and spoke on behalf of Asthana
 yah jaankaree isliye bhi mahatvapurn he ki verma ke khilaaf sivisi ne jo report di he vah puri tarah se asthana kii shikayaton ke aadhaar par he
 Chaudhary wanted Verma to change the adverse remarks made in Asthana's annual career report
 pratikul tippanee ke kaaran pramotion ruk jaataa he
 After Alok Verma refused, Rakesh Asthana started sending complaints against Verma to the Central Vigilance Commissioner
 usee ke aadhaar par verma ko hataaya gaya
 Varma takes no cognizance of the complaints against Asthana
 justise patnayak ne bhi indian express kii seemaa chishti se kaha he ki kendriya satarkta ayukta kii report main jo aarope hai ve sahi nahin hai
 Are baseless justise patnayak ne rohinee singh se bhi kaha he ki unhone indian express se jo kaha he us par kaayam hai
 Six cases of investigation against Asthana are pending in the CBI
 asthana dilli hoicourt gaye the ki exiaar kaarij kii jaae magar hoicourt ne ulta sibiai ko hi das hafte ke bheetar jaanch karne ke aadesh de die
 Now tell me, do you think that the Prime Minister should have made the decision to remove Alok Verma? What does morality say? Will the rulers do anything for Ambani? Now find this news in any of your Hindi newspapers
 kya koi akhbaar is khabar kaa follow ap kar rahaa he? aisi nahin he ki hindi akhbaaron ke paas manze hue patrkaar nahin hai, magar aisi khabaren kahaan hai? sarkaar or sivisi ko fark nahin padataa kyonki unhen pataa he ki aisi khabaren hindi akhbaaron or channelon ke zarie janata tak pahunchengi hi nahin
 Today, the Telegraph newspaper also said that former Chief Justice TS Thakur said that Alok Verma should be given a chance to speak
 kisi bhi sarkaar kaa moolyankan uske daur kii media kii haalat se shuru hona chahie
 If the media is not free, then based on what information you are evaluating that government, ask yourself this question and ask your Hindi newspaper and news channels
 sabakuch barbaad ho jaae, isse pehle yah sawaal zarur puuchhen
 Note- a rumor is being spread that Alok Verma helped Mallya to drive away
 tathy yah he ki maalya ke bhaagane ke ek saal baad verma chif bane
 Mallya ran with the help of the entire government machinery
 itane bhi bhole na bane
 If you make a fool, at least don't be foolish

 iske baavjood sharad pavaar ajit pavaar ke khilaaf sakht rukh nahin apana rahe hai or lagaataar ensipi ke diggaj netaa unhen manaane main jute hai
 In the midst of all this, Sharad Pawar has given rise to the issue of CM of two and a half years
 aise main sharad pavaar ke man main kya chal rahaa he, iskaa andaja koi bhi nahin laga paa rahaa he
 Soft Sharad Pawar on Ajit Pawar Ajit Pawar has joined hands with BJP by breaking NCP
 iske baad bhi sharad pavaar ne ajit pavaar ko na to party se baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya he or na hi koi thos karrwai kii he
 Sharad Pawar is completely soft on Ajit Pawar
 'pavaar parivaar' kii koshishhai ki kisi bhi tarah ajit pavaar ko manaaya jaae or unhen phir ensipi kheme main waapas bulaayaa jaae
 In view of this, Sharad Pawar and Supriya Sule have also talked to Ajit Pawar's brother Srinivas

 aise main sawaal uthta he ki is bayaan ke jariye ensipi sharad pavaar ne kya siyaasi sandesh dena chaahate hai
 Has Sharad Pawar tried to convey political message in this gesture? shivasena ne bijepi ke saamne dhai-dhai saal ke siem kaa formula rakhaa tha, jis par baat nahin ban saki thi
 In such a political crisis, when the Shiv Sena is on the back foot, Sharad Pawar has run the gamut of political bargain by keeping the cm's talk for two and a half years
 saath hi sharad pavaar ne kaha ki shivasena ke saath kuch bhi bura nahin ho saktaa, kyonki maine unase vaada kiya he
 He said that the three parties have to run the government together for 5 years, so nothing should happen in a hurry
 aise main sharad pavaar ke man main kya chal rahaa he, isko na to congressi samaj paa rahe hai or na hin shivasena ke netaa

 pradhanmantri ke salaahkaar sam pitroda ne kaha, "ham 12veen panchavarshiya yojana main shiksha par kareeb 100 arab dollar kharch karne ja rahe hai
 "he said that the government has opened the doors for private and migrants for greater investment in education
 pitroda ne kaha, "hamaari manshaa shiksha vyavastha ko udaar banane kii he
 What we did to improve the economy in 1991, now needs to be done for education
 " unhone pravasi bharatiyon se bharat ke shiksha kshetra main nivesh karne ko kaha
 Pitroda said, "there are vast opportunities for private investment in this sector
 mauka sthaneey niveshkon or pravaasiyon ke liye hai
 "it is noteworthy that more than 15,00 diaspora Indians are participating in the Ninth Pravasi Day celebrations
 yah sankhya pichley varsh kii sankhya se 20 pratishat adhik he
 On 20 March, Union Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar announced to provide full autonomy to 62 institutions of higher education
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar shiksha ke kshetra main udaar vyavastha kaayam karnaa chaahati he or swytatta ko gunvattta se jodne par jor de rahi he
 Javadekar described the government's move as historic
 yah aitihaasik to he lokin us tarah nahin jaisaa ki shiksha mantri or sarkaar kaa daawa he
 If we look at the amount of higher education received and the terms of the University Grants Commission (UGC) notification on autonomy in this budget, then it becomes clear that the government is actually pulling back from education
 vishvavidhyalayon ko swaittata sambandhi 12 farvari 2018 kii ujisi kii adhisuchana main sansthaanon ko do shreniyon main swaittata dene kii baat kahi gai he
 Institutions in both categories have been given some leeway, which do not require permission from the UGC
 lekin isaki shart yahi he ki sansthaanon ko uske liye fund khud jutanaa hoga or sarkaar se vah koi anudaan nahin maangege
 This shows that the government will not fund these institutions in return for this perceived autonomy
 swaittata kii shrenee-1 vaale santhaan bina ujisi ke anumodan ke hi nae paathyakram, skool centre aadi khol sakate hai yaa phir sudur campus bhi khol sakate hai
 But the condition is that they will not ask for funds from the government
 vahiin shrenee-2 ke santhaan bina anumodan ke nae paathyakram, skool aadi to khol sakate hai lekin sudur campus ke samay ujisi kii anumati chahie par anumati pradaan karte samay nirikshan kii jarurat nahin rahegi
 But the condition of all this is that the institution will not expect any kind of fund from the government
 isi tarah bajet main sarkaar ne vishvavidhyalay, iity, iiem aadi ucch shiksha ke sabhi swaittat sansthaanon ke bajet main pichhali baar kii tulana main kareeb 3,233 karod ru
 Cut it down
 isse bhi saaf he ki sarkaar ucch shiksha se haath khinch rahi he
 The students will have to pay the price for this perceived autonomy
 darasal ye santhaan chaatro kii fees aadi badha kar hi apana fund juta sakate hai
 Secondly, they will have to raise funds in private sectors, so the money that will be given, obviously, the institutions will remain in danger of losing their autonomy or being affected
 yahi vajah he ki chaatr or shikshak sanghathan ise shiksha ke nijeekaran kii kavayad maan rahe hai

 unhone kaha tha ki musalamaanon ko ayodhya main mandir nirmaan ke liye car seva kerani chahie
 The comments gauratlab he ki upi main samaajawaadee sarkaar ke darja hasil mantri ompal nehra ne musalamaanon kaa aahvaan kiya tha ki ve ayodhya, mathura or kaashi main masjidon par apana dawa chhodkar vahaan mandir banavaane main hinduon kaa saath den

 He took a fight with the BJP, VHP and the Sangh Parivar when the Babri Masjid was demolished

 Significantly, the Minister of Socialist Government status in UP, Ompal Nehra, had called upon Muslims to support Hindus in Ayodhya, Mathura and Kashi by leaving their medicine on mosques and building temples there
 sapa netaa ne upi ke bijanour jile main choudhary charansingh jayanti ke ek kaarykram main musalamaanon ko yah naseehat di thi
 Let me tell you that Nehra, 65 years old, is said to be close to Mulayam Singh Yadav
 unhone babari masjid giraae jane par bijepi, viechpi or sangh parivaar se morcha liya tha
 Nehra questioned the Muslims that "you tell me that if Lord Ram's temple is not built in Ayodhya now, where will it be built?" He told the Muslims that if they want friendship and reconciliation among the Hindus and Muslims in the country, then there is only one way to leave their medicine at the mosques in these three places

 "" Britain's parliament on Thursday passed a resolution in favor of moving the country out of the European Union, the Breguit Agreement, from 29 March
 bregsit ko lekar desh main jari raajnneetik gatirodh ke bich yah prastaav paarit hua he
 In the House of Commons, 412 mps voted in favor of this proposal related to the delay in 'brexit Day' while 202 members voted in opposition
 haalanki, bregsit main deree ke liye europea sangh ke sabhi 27 deshon kii sahmati kii jarurat hogi
 Meanwhile, EU leaders have indicated that they are not in favor of extending the date of Breguit on the basis of the ongoing political deadlock in Britain

 On the other hand the European Union said that it could do nothing more than this

 a resolution has now been passed to extend the date of this process
 After an exasperating few days, Parliament’s rejection of no deal and desire for an extension shows there is still some common sense in Westminster
 But without a radically new approach, business fears this is simply a stay of execution

 ye kahani 70 saal puraani he
 In the year 1947, two countries were born on the world map
 ek bharat, doosraa pakistan
 Pakistan became the first country in the world to be built on the basis of the religion of Islam
 bantwaare ke baad se lekar aaj tak pakistan ne aisi 5 ahm galtiyaan kii hai, jisane use naa sirf barbaadi ke kagaar par khadaa kar diya he, balki do tukdon main bhi baant diya
 Here we will tell you those 5 mistakes of Pakistani from partition to waste
 ye wo galtiyaan jisane pakistan ke itihaas kii tareekhen badal di
 1- Pakistan's access to remote Washington DC After the Second World War in 1945, America rapidly emerged as a superpower
 lekin rus ne use kadi takkar di
 So the world got divided into two camps
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke do saal baad 1947 main aaazaad hue bharat aurapakistanke saamne do raste the
 Either going to the American camp or Russia
 bharatne teesraa rasta chunaa gutnirpekshata kaa
 That is, to create your own path by creating equal distance from both
 lekin pakistan ne yahaan par sabase badi galati kar di
 Pakistan had been traveling to Washington DC since 1947 to join the American camp
 lekin shuruyaat main america ne use ghaas nahin daalaa
 In 1953, there was a change in American politics
 jon foster dales republican raashtrapati dwite ijanhaavar ke videsh mantri bane
 Dalles made a policy for America in 1954
 ye niti thi puri duniya main rus ke khilaaf sheet yuddh ko tej karnaa
 America needed strategic allies from Central Asia, South Asia to the whole world to surround Russia
 bas yaheen pakistan kii lottery lag gai
 Indeed, through Pakistan, the US wanted to end Russia's interference in Afghanistan
 lihaaja, is daur main america ne pakistan samet duniya ke kai deshon ke saath sainya gathbandhan kiye
 Which includes pacts like Baghdad Pact, Santo, Seeto
 pakistan ke jariye apane hiton ko saadhane ke liye america ne khule haath se pakistan ko paise or hathiyaar dene shuru kiye
 At the behest of America, Pakistan started raising the slogan of Jihad in Afghanistan
 kul milakar british bedi se aaazaad hua pakistan america kaa gulam ban gaya
 Now his remote control was operated from Washington DC instead of London
 bantwaare ke baad america ke saath jane kaa pakistan ke hukmaranon kaa faisla behad doorgaami niklaa
 This broadly resulted in three results - (a) Pakistan's economy and military became completely dependent on the US money
 muft ke paison ne pakistan ke hukmaranon ko nikamma bana diya
 Even today, as America pulls back its hands, Pakistan's hands and feet begin to swell
 (b)america ko pakistan ke nagarikon kii nahin balkee uski us fouj kii jarurat thi, jiskaa istemaal wo afghanistan main pair failaa rahe rus ko rokane ke liye karnaa chahta tha
 Therefore, the importance of military in Pakistan increased, which was against the spirit of democracy
 (c)loktantr main niyam-kanoon, chunaav, nyaaypalika taqatvar hoti he, lekin america kii taraf jane se pakistan main in sabakaa astitv khatre main pad gaya, kyonki america aisa nahin chahta tha
 Neither elections were held in Pakistan nor did the judiciary get the status that it enjoys
 hua ye ki nagarikon ke adhikaar ko taakh par rakhte hue naukarshah or sena ne gathjod bana kar satta par kabja kar liya
 The result was that the army in Pakistan became all-round
 sena ke prabhaav main bharat ke saath teen yuddh (1947, 1965, 1971) hue
 Pakistan was badly defeated in all three wars and in 1971 Pakistan broke up into two parts
 nayaa desh bana bangladesh
 In the meantime, neither the industry nor the agriculture were concentrated in Pakistan
 nateeja ye hua ki america se mili khayraat ke paison se pakistan main sena or naukarshah varg to bahut amir ho gaya, lekin janata garibi se neeche jivan jeene ko majaboor ho gai
 Seeing the greed for money, the army pushed the unemployed youth on the path of terror against Afghanistan and India
 garibi, bhukhmaree or aatankwaad puri duniya main pakistan kii pahchaan ban gai
 2- Pakistan Federal Court's far-reaching verdict belongs to Pakistan's judiciary's second biggest mistake
 pakistan main 1954 main samvidhan sabha bani
 Ghulam Mohammed was the Governor General at that time
 unhone samvidhan sabha ko bhang kar diya
 At that time, the Governor General and the President had the same rank in Pakistan
 maulavee tamizuddin us samay sindh asembli ke spikar the
 Tamizuddin moved the High Court
 sindh hai court ne bada faisla dete hue governor general gulam mohammad ke faisle ko naa sirf khaarij kar diya, balki samvidhan sabha ko phir se behaal kar diya
 Governor General Ghulam Mohammad reached the Federal Court in appeal against it
 us samay pakistan ke supreme court ko fedral court kehete the
 The Chief Justice of the Federal Court was Mohammad Munir
 justise munir ne 1955 main faisla diya or ek nai misaal kaayam karte hue 'kanoon-e-jarurat' kii nai avadharana di
 He said in his decision that the Governor General Ghulam Mohammed's decision under the 'law of Necessity' was correct
 pakistan ke itihaas main pehali baar 'najariya-e-zarurat' naam kii aisi avadharana saamne ai jisane pakistan kii kismat hi badal di
 The existence of the constitutional institution was destroyed, killing democracy
 pakistan ke is sanvaidhanik sanstha ko aage jaakar bharat kii tarah kii ek sansadeey sabha ke rup main parivartit hona tha
 This constitutional body was to announce elections in Pakistan later
 'kanoon-e-jarurat' pakistan kii gale kii fans ban gaya
 Due to this law, Ayub Khan's coup was later legalized, Yahya Khan upheld the coup
 jiya-ul-haq ne takhtapalat ko kanoon sammat bataaya or sabase aakhir main general parvej musharraf ke takhtapalat ko sahi tehraaya gaya
 Justice Munir, who gave the verdict of 'law-a-need', in his book 'from Jinnah to Jiya' in 1984, himself admitted that his decision changed the fate of Pakistan
 3- pakistani pradhanmantri mohammad ali bogra kaa vivaadit faisla1954 main pradhanmantri mohammad ali bogra ne ek vivaadit formula pesh kiya
 This formula is known as Bogra formula in the history of Pakistan
 formule ke tahat pashchim pakistan ke sabhi suubon ko (rajyon, riyasaton, swat, kabaili ilaakon ko milakar) milakar ek suba banaaya janaa tha
 In this decision, it was decided to eliminate Swat, tribal and local autonomy, identity and culture of the province and incorporate them into one state
 isi tarah se purvi pakistan (jo ab bangladesh he) ko ek soobe main baandhne kii baat kahi gai
 Bogra Saheb announced in 1954 and he did so in 1955
 iske baad aayub khan jab satta main aae to unhone ise kanoonee rup se or majboot karke lagu kar diya
 Pakistan was divided into two subos (west Pakistan and East Pakistan)
 san 1962 ke pakistani samvidhan main bhi ise amalijama pahana diya gaya
 This disputed decision had a terrible result
 pakistan ke alag-alag suubon main aazaadee kii aawaaj buland hone lagi
 Since 1955, till date, Balochistan has been saying in the whole world that it has been captured by Pakistan at the point of gun
 baluchistan kaa kahana he ki 1947 ke bantwaare ke vakt pakistan ke kaayade ajam jinna ne baluchistan kii janata se jo vaada kiya tha pakistan ke hukmran uskaa paalan nahin kar rahe hai
 Jinnah promised that Baluchistan would be part of Pakistan but would have its own rule
 apana kanoon hoga
 After 1955, Pakhtuns started saying the same thing that they had to make Pakhtunistan, they had to make their own law
 shashan tantra khadaa karnaa tha
 But he has been forcibly part of Pakistan at gunpoint
 pakistan main bantwaare ko (baluchistan, pakhtunistan) lekar jo aawaaj uthne lagi wo 1955 main pradhanmantri mohammad ali bogra ke us faisle ke baad uthne lagi jisamen unhone pakistan ke purvi or pashchimi bhaag ke tamaam suubon ko milakar do agal-alag unit yaa rajya banane kaa faisla kiya
 The rebellion started for the first time in Balochistan during Ayub Khan's tenure when Bogra saheb's decision to make Pakistan a central unit forced Ayod Khan to come to power
 ayub khan ke vakt main hi jo beej purvi pakistan or pashchimi pakistan ke boe gaye usne pakistan main aarthik rup se bhedbhaav, kshetreey str par logon ke saath bhedbhaav, logon ke utpeedan kaa silsilaa shuru kar diya
 East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) started saying that we earn from jute and take advantage of West Pakistan, all development is happening only in West Pakistan
 haalaaki kii hakeekat ye thi kii pashchim pakistan main bhi vikaas sirf punjab praant or karachi main ho rahaa tha
 There was no development in Baluchistan and frontier areas
 or naa hi vikaas sindh ke ilaakon main dikhaai diya
 The accusations that people from the Punjab region dominate in Pakistan
 punjabi civil military ke logon kaa pakistan par raaj he
 The reason for such sentiment started only because of forcibly making Pakistan into a province and its first result was shown in 1971 when Pakistan was split into two
 ab baluchistan bhi pakistan se alag hone ke liye lard rahaa he
 If Pakistan had given attention to regional identity like India from the beginning, the voices of rebellion would not have been raised in Pakistan
 yahaan ek baat samajni hogi ki fouj or naukarshahi hameshaa kendriya cmand par yakeen karti he
 The concept of holding power command in one hand is military
 vikendrikaran kii niti raajnneetik log apanaate hai
 Politics believe in sharing power
 yahi vajah he ki musharraf ke kaarykaal main jab kendriya cmand shuru hua to baluchistan main vidroh kii aawaaj tej ho gai
 During this period, the importance of military generals on every issue of Pakistan increased
 4- purvi pakistan main hue chunaav ke nateezon ko manyata nahin denapakistan kii satta main jab yahaya khan aae to vahaan par chunaav hue
 When elections were held, the people of Bengal (east Pakistan) got a chance to express their anger
 shaikh mujiburrahman ke liye purvi pakistan main jamkar vot hue or unki awami lig ko bahumat mila
 Pakistan's biggest mistake was that it refused to accept the election results
 agar pakistan us vakt chunaav kaa faisla maan letaa to uske tukade nahin hote
 Pakistan's civil-military bureaucracy, which now also includes political people (zulfiqar Ali Bhutts won a majority in West Pakistan) did not allow Mujibur Rahman to become the Prime Minister of Pakistan
 khaas baat ye thi ki sena ke is faisle ke saath julfikaar ali bhutto bhi the
 Therefore, it was fiercely opposed in East Pakistan and a rebellion started
 pakistan ne iske khilaaf faujee karrwai shuru kii
 Millions of people were killed
 purvi pakistan se bharat main sharnaarthi aane lage
 India offered Mujib's help
 mujeeb ne maan liya
 He said that Bengal Muslims had made the most sacrifices for Pakistan, but West Pakistan had always looked at it from the point of view of Hikrat
 1965 ke yuddh ke baad se hi bharat-pakistan ke rishte behad talkh chal rahe the
 Hindustan intervened and sent its army to help the people there in East Pakistan
 pakistan ke do tukade ho gaye
 5- Pakistan's needless interference in Afghanistan
 Afghanistan was always a satellite of Russia
 vahaan andruni halaat is tarah se hue kii communist party ne techover kar liya
 Even before when there was a monarchy, he had relations with Russia
 jis tarah se pakistan america kii bahari chaowkee thi, usee tarah se afghanistan bhi rus kii bahari chaowkee thi
 This thing used to knock America
 america ne pakistan ko kaha afghanistan main jehad shuru karo
 For this, the US started giving money to Pakistan
 jiya-ul-haq ne america se paisa or hathiyaar lene ke laalach main bevajaah afghanistan par dhaava bol diya
 In Pakistan, Buddhists refer to this move in Pakistan as a murderer
 afghanistan main ye bhavan fail gai ki america ke paise par pakistan kiraye kaa kaatil ban gaya he
 After 8 to 10 years, when America moved from here, Pakistan became lonely
 isi bich pakistan main 10 saal tak jiya-ul-haq sahab kaa sainik shashan chalata rahaa
 The elections could not be held
 is dauraan america se pakistan ko khub paisa mila
 When the money was received, the strength of the army increased
 fouj kii kshamta bhi bad gai
 The coffers of military officers and bureaucrats continued to be filled, but Avam could not find anything
 chunki fouj ko jehad ko pramot karnaa tha, aloktantric ravaie ko nyyochit tehraana tha, lihaaja fouj kaa jhootha islamickaran kiya gaya
 In the name of Islam, the Pakistani people were tricked that since the army is protecting Islam, there is no need for democracy in Pakistan
 iskaa nateeja behad khatarnaak hua
 In Pakistan, there was violence in the name of Islam
 samskritiyon main takaraav shuru ho gaya
 The jihad, terrorism, violence, shia-sunni conflict were fueled by the army
 aaj jis kattarpanthi takaton se pakistan jujh rahaa he wo sab afghanistan main america ke ishaare par bevajaah dakhal dene kii vajah se he
 War on Terror also came up for this reason
 aaj pakistani fouj is baat ko lekar pareshaan hai ki jehadi ab ulta unheen ke gale pad gaye hai
 Today, the shia-sunni conflict has increased in Pakistan, the Taliban are killing the Barelwis
 ladaai ho rahi he ki islam he kya? ye sari ladaaiyon kii vajah 1980 ke dashak main jiya-ul-haq ke dauraan afghanistan main pakistan ke dakhal kaa nateeja he
 Pakistan is suffering as a result of this
 pakistan ke dakhal se pehle kabul main pakistan hi nahin puri duniya se log ghoomane jate the
 The weather in Afghanistan was very good and because of Russia's interference there, the western culture spoke
 ye sari jehad, ladaai, maar-kaat, khun-kharaba jo 1980 main shuru hua or 10 saal rahaa
 Then after 10 years, there was a civil war in Afghanistan of Jihadis and Mujahideens
 or phir uske baad taliban, america or duniya bhar ke aatankiyon kaa garh ban gaya afghanistan
 There has been an atmosphere of instability in Afghanistan for the last 30 years before there was peace
 america se saath milakar pakistan ne use nark bana diya or ab afghanistan ke aatankwaadiyon ne pakistan ko nark bana diya he
 Until a few days ago Tarun Tejpal had everything
 kalam kii takat thi
 There was a glow of wealth
 palak jhapakate apane sting opareshnon se achche-acchon kii saakh mitti main mila dene kaa dhardaar hunar tha
 But on November 7 and 8, in a five-star hotel in Goa, the man did what he did to a girl under his own power, making a dent in Tarun Tejpal's fort, once counted among Asia's most powerful journalists, for Tejpal Neither it is possible to save its stronghold nor itself
 ye takat kaa nasha tha
 The realization of his presence in the big and high profile sections
 yaa phir kisi kii bhi chulein hilaa dene kii galatfahami
 
 
 Whatever Tejpal did to a lady generalist working in his own magazine, Tehelka, inside the elevator in the dark of night, he brought the stars of Tejpal's fortune to the night
 20 november ko tejpal ne chah maheene ke liye tahalaka kii sabase oonchi kursi se hatane kaa faisla kiya tha, lekin isi din se saare halaat unke khilaaf ho gaye
 After this, as the matter progressed and continued to grow
 pehle sirf apni managing editor se shikaayat karanevaali is ladki ne police or magistrate ke saamne apane bayaan darj karwaae or dekhte hi dekhte tarun tejpal ko kanoonee museebaton ne gher liya
 The people who were saved by the sting of Tejpal also broke the opportunity on Tejpal and on the other hand, the threat of arrest on Tejpal's head started
 police kabhi tejpal ke naam saman jari karti, to kabhi adaalat se gaiyr jamaanti warrant hasil karti or isi apadhapi ke bich shuukravaar yani 29 november kaa din is tej-tarraar patrkaar kii jindagi kaa sabase uthal-puthal bharaa din sabit hua
 Until morning, Tejpal stayed away from his house and escaped from the police, but by the day, Tejpal got relief from the court in installments
 pehle teen ghante or phir agle din subah das baje tak
 In the meantime, Anjan Tejpal, on his way from Delhi to Goa, went on a journey which was like two and a half hours, but maybe more than two and a half hours for Tejpal
 
 
 akhirkaar tejpal ek baar phir se usee goa main the, jahaan se pehali baar unke takadir ke sitara doobane laga tha
 Tarun Tejpal, accused of sexual exploitation, has created panic all over the country, exactly 12 on Friday afternoon
 58 minute par goa jane ke liye dilli ke indira gandhi airport par najar aae
 For the past few days, the Goa Police was lying behind Tejpal with his hands washed and he would slip every time from the police
 lekin hawaii raste se goa jane ke liye jab tejpal jab shuukravaar kii dopaher dilli ke airport par hajir hue to phir ve naa to media ke camaron se batch sake or naa hi vardiwaalon se
 Police immediately surrounded them
 tejpal shaayad itani aasaani se kaabo main nahin aate, lekin pichley 24 ghanton ke dauraan goa police ne un par kanoon kaa shikanja kuch itani teji se ksaa ki unke saamne sidhe goa kii flite pakadaney ke sivaay koi rasta hi nahin bachaa
 He had obtained a non-bailable warrant in the name of Tejpal from Panaji's Sessions Court on Thursday, having missed the deadline to appear before the police
 or shuukravaar kii subah hote-hote vahi goa police tejpal ke ghar main chhapemari kar rahi thi
 But despite this rage on his face, the police did not find any clue
 alabatta jab tejpal kii patni ne takreeban do ghante kii poochtacha ke baad bhi police ko apane pati se pichley 24 ghanton se naa milane kii baat kahi, tab jaakar police ne tejpal kaa ghar choda
 Apparently, Tejpal's hide and seek with the Goa Police was continuing and in this connection, the police decided to search every flight from Delhi to Goa
 police ne dilli krime branch ke saath milakar dilli main tejpal ke kai thikaanon ke saath-saath har flites kii booking kii jaanch kii
 Tejpal had already withdrawn his anticipatory bail application filed in the Delhi High Court
 aise main unke paas giraftaar se bachane kaa or koi rasta nahin bachaa tha
 So, as soon as the court time started, Tejpal's lawyers went to the same court from where the police had secured a non-bailable warrant against him
 tejpal kii is koshish kaa phayda ye hue ki unhen court se dhai baje tak ke liye giraftaar se raahat mil gai
 Apparently, now Tejpal could once again breathe in the open air
 or adaalat se mili isi abhaydaan ke baad wo apane vakil or gharavaalon ke saath goa jane ke liye dilli se ravaanaa hue
 The family members thought that their Tarun would grow up to be a big officer
 lekin tarun kii ankhon main ek ke baad ek teen sapane tairte rahe
 The first dream was to write a book
 doosraa sapana tivi par aana or teesraa sapana apana dot com shuru karnaa
 Riding on these dreams, Tarun Tejpal from Chandigarh to Delhi grew from one to one and kept forging fort
 lekin khud ke aacharan or imaan kaa kila bharbarakar sidhe kanoon kii choukhat par gira he
 The revelations of Tejpal expanded the scope of Tejpal's thinking
 or tahalaka ke naam par hi unke dot-com ne khoji patrakarita kii duniya main unki dhak or saakh ko
 In 2007, Tehelka did a sting of how the people of BJP, VHP and Bajrang Dal had rioted in Naroda Patiya in Gujarat
 tejpal ne is baat kaa bhi khulaasa kiya tha ki kaise 700 karod ke telecom ghotaale main dayaanidhi maaran kaa haath tha
 And how the increasing rape incidents in Delhi are the result of irresponsible attitude of Delhi Police
 lekin ittfa dekhie ki vahi tejpal aaj balaatkaar kii kanoonee dhaaraon kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 From Delhi to Goa
 lekin tahalaka namaki apni dream magagin ko nikaalane se pehle tarun tejpal ne apni kalam kaa jaadu bhi dikhaa diya tha
 In 2005, Tarun Tejpal's novel The Alchemy of Desire was published
 tejpal kaa upanyaas8 baras pehle yon shaushan ko lekar tejpal ne aisa upanyaas likhaa ki duniya main usne dhooma machaa di
 This debut novel by Tarun Tejpal 'the Alchemy of Desire' was selected for the Bad Sex Award
 ittefaq dekhie ki 8 saal baad khud tarun tejpal isi bed sex ke kathghare main khadey he 
 The UK award is given to the book that has the most embarrassing description of sexual activity
 ye bhi sanyog dekhiye ki peedita ke jis i-mail ko aadhaar banaakar goa police ne cese darj kiya use wo goa main sabase sharmnaak maanati he
 The special thing is that this novel of Tarun Tejpal was also selected in the final list of the French Literature Prize Prix Femina whose jury consists only of women and, coincidentally, the women of Tehelka, their own magazine about Tarun Tejpal, were the first to resign
 Started because she was deeply hurt by his pleas on sexual harassment of Tarun Tejpal
 khoji patrakarita ko glamer ke rang main rangane vaale tarun tejpal ne bahut kuch kamaaya
 Big price with name too
 ek patrkaar se kaarobaari bhi ban gaye
 But drunk to earn everything, Tejpal probably forgot the Visakha guidelines of the Supreme Court and forgot the dignity of the editor
 anjaam dharti se aasmaan tak ud rahaa he
 The pain of the victim 'I do not know whether i myself or my friends and supporters are still willing to see me as a rape victim
 
 
 lekin sach yahi he ki ye sabakuch peedit tay nahin karti, balki ye kaanoon tay karata he
 
 
 And the law is very clear in this case, whatever Tejpal did to me, it comes under the purview of rape
 ' ye alfaaz hai us bahadur ladki ke, jisane tahalaka ke chif or jane-maane patrkaar tarun tejpal ke khilaaf yon utpeedan kaa iljaam lagaakar puure desh main tahalaka machaa diya he
 On Friday, this girl not only kept her heart open in her statement to the media, but also told how despite all the difficulties she is engaged in this fight
 ladki ne kaha he, 'tejpal kii tarah ye ladaai mere liye daulat or rasookh kii ladaai nahin, balki izzat kii ladaai he
 It is a fight to tell that my body is not the property of my employer
 lekin hakeekat yahi he ki ye shikaayat darj karavaate hi maine naa sirf apni pasandida naukari balki aarthik aatmanirbharta bhi kho di he, balki apane aap ko nijee hamalon ke liye bhi taiyaar kar liya he
 This fight is not easy
 'peedit ladki ne agar is ladaai main uskaa saath dene ke liye logon kaa shukriya adaa kiya, to khud par ungali uthaanewaalon ko bhi aade haathon bhi liya
 He said, 'if i am thankful to the people for support in this battle, then i am also hurt because of some statements such as calling my fight a political conspiracy before the election
 ' The political thorn in the state considered India's most important battlefield has started moving away from the BJP towards the samajwadi-congress alliance
 kitni dur jaakar aakhir main ye kanta rukta he, isi par nirbhar karegaa ki bijepi phinishing line ko vijeta ke taur par paar karne main kaamyaab rahati he yaa akhilesh-rahul ke gathjod ke aage maat kha jaati he
 According to the last opinion poll conducted by axis-my India for India Today group before the UP elections, bjp's account has decreased by 25 seats compared to the previous opinion poll
 pichhlaa opinian pole disambar main or taaja opinian pole janvari main kiya gaya
 According to axis-my India estimates, the BJP is going to get 180 to 191 seats in UP if the elections are held immediately
 lekin espi-congress gathbandhan bhi zyada peeche nahin he
 The alliance is projected to get 168–178 seats
 gathbandhan se sabase zyada nuksaan bahujan samaaj party (bispi) ko hota dikh rahaa he
 The BSP is seen losing 40 seats between December and January
 pichley ek maheene main sabhi ahm raajnneetik takaton ke vot share ke hisse main bhi bada utaar-chadhaav dekhne ko mila he
 The BSP was seen losing a fifth of its vote share in a month
 is party kaa vot share 26% se ghatakar 20
 Came in at 1%
 najar aayaa 'gathbandhan' kaa phaaydataja opinian pole ke aankade dikhaate hai ki congress ke haath kaa saath samaajawaadee party kii cycle ko milane se samaajawaadee party ke voton main 7% voton kaa ijapha hua he
 According to opinion polls, SP has 26 per cent
 lekin congress ke saath gathbandhan hone ke baad is gathbandhan ko 33
 It is estimated to get 2% votes
 haalanki is nae gathbandhan se bijepi kaa apana vot share kamovesh aprabhavit he
 The fact is that bjp's own vote share, which was seen as 33% in December, increased to 34 in January
 8% ho gaya
 The election in UP is now broadly like a two-horse race between the BJP and the sp-congress alliance
 disambar main bijepi ko nikatatam pratidwandvi espi par 100 seat kii badhat hasil thi
 But now with akhilesh-rahul, they have completely changed the political equations of UP
 haalanki pradesh main congress haashie par pahunchi takat he lekin isane ek maheene ke antaraal main hi tathakthith dharmanirpeksh gathbandhan ke liye 76 siton kaa ijapha karne main madad kii he
 If the UP election is compared to horse racing, then in December the BJP horse was running somewhere ahead
 lekin janvari main isaki raftaar main kami aana shuru hua
 On the other hand, the sp's horse received a powerful dose from the Congress, so it started running at a faster pace than before
 agle kuch hafte ye tay karenge ki bijepi kaa ghoda apni badhat ko barkaraar rakhane main kaamyaab rahata he yaa phir aakhri strtch main pratidwandvi kii ore se pachhad diya jaataa he
 At the moment, the vote share difference between the two main rivals is 1
 6% se bhi kam par aa tikaa he jo apane aap main 'margin of erar' ke andar aata he
 It is important to keep in mind that while looking at these poll scores, the Axis teams started doing ground work for the latest opinion poll from January 15 onwards
 us vakt gathbandhan ke astitv main aane ko lekar halchal thi lekin saath hi kuch anischitata bhi thi
 This was due to frequent reports of breakdown of talks for the alliance
 espi-congress gathbandhan kaa elaan aakhirkaar 22 janvari ko hua
 But by then, 40% of the survey work by Axis had been completed
 exis ke teenon pole ke dauraan jatigat aankadon ke adhyayan se dilachasp tathy saamne aae ki kis tarah upi kaa chunavi ganit badalata rahaa he
 In the last one month, there has been a huge gathering of Yadavs and Muslims in favor of sp-congress alliance
 disambar main 72% yadavon kaa kahana tha ki ve espi ko vot denge
 In January, this figure increased by 10% to 82%
 isaki ek badi vajah ye he ki disambar main jitne yadav bijepi ke paksh main vot dene kii baat kar rahe the, unamem se bhi aadhe espi kii taraf mud gaye
 In December, 71% of Muslims said they would vote for SPCO
 janvari main ye aankada badhkar 74% ho gaya
 The sp's alliance with the Congress has helped bring in 19% of the upper caste votes
 disambar main akele espi ko savarna votaron main sirf 9% hissaa hi mil rahaa tha
 Meanwhile, in the last one month, the BSP was seen losing some support among all caste classes
 duusari ore, beete ek maheene main anya pichhadaa varg (obisi) or savarna voton kaa bijepi ke paksh main jamaavada hua he
 For BJP, 53% of obcs were showing leanings in December, which has increased to 56% in January
 vahiin savarnon kii baat kii jaae to bijepi kaa samarthan disambar main 61% se badhkar janvari main 68% ho gaya he
 If BJP gets an edge in Eastern UP, then if the region is divided region-wise, then the BJP is seeing a clear lead in Eastern UP
 is kshetra main kul 167 seat hai
 According to Axis estimates, BJP is going to get 89 seats in eastern UP
 vahiin espi-congress gathbandhan ke khate main 55 siten ja sakati hai
 The BSP may have to satisfy itself on 22 seats
 agar pashchimi upi kii kul 136 siton kii baat kii jaae to yahaan muslimon ke badi taadaad main ekajute hone kii vajah se espi-congress ke khate main 68 siten ja sakati hai
 In western UP, BJP can get 53 seats
 vahiin bispi sirf 13 siton par hi jeet hasil karti najar aa rahi he
 Central UP has traditionally been considered a stronghold of the Samajwadi Party
 yahaan kii kul 81 siton main se espi-congress gathbandhan ko 47, bijepi ko 31 or bispi ko sirf 3 siten milane kaa anumaan he
 Bundelkhand is the smallest region of UP
 yahaan bijepi ko 12, espi-congress gathbandhan ko 4 or bispi ko 3 seat mil sakati hai
 In such a situation, the big question is that when the situation is getting favorable for sp-congress alliance, will Akhilesh and Rahul be able to beat Narendra Modi and Amit Shah on the counting day? It all depends on what comes out during the campaign in the next one month
 If the Muslims and Yadav are united behind the sp-congress alliance, in response to this, there is gathering in support of the obcs and the upper castes Kabijp
 agle ek maheene main hindu voton kaa jutana or bad saktaa he
 Distinguishing from Bihar, UP has a long history of communal polarization
 bijepi ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main iskaa kaamyaab prayog kiya tha
 If communal mercury rises further during campaigning, then the Hindu votes coming to a ghat can help BJP to counter the caste arithmetic of Team Akhilesh and Rahul
 vahiin, espi or congress majbootee se prachaar abhiyaan chalaati hai, sahi ummidavaaron ko maidan main utaarti he, saath hi dharmanirpeksh gathbandhan kii ore se acchhee sankhya main savarna ummidavaaron par daanv lagaaya jaataa he to bijepi ke samarthan main savarnon kaa jutana sambhavat: simit ho jayega
 Because many upper caste voters can vote in favor of upper caste candidates raised by the alliance
 ek or bada swing factor dalit vot bhi he
 So far, both the Jatav and non-jatav votes were seen standing in the bsp's court during the three opinion polls of the Axis
 lekin jaise jaise bispi kii sthiti kamjor padane kii charchaa jor pakad rahi he, aise main sambhaavna he ki gaiyr jatvon main se kuch vot dene ke liye apni praathamikta badal sakate hai
 Simply put, Muslims and Yadavs are seen standing behind the sp-congress alliance
 isi ke mukaable savarna or obisi bijepi ke paksh main ekajute ho rahe hai
 But in the end, where will the Dalit vote go, it will decide who will be crowned on the throne of UP? The war of Uttar Pradesh is still open
 aglaa ek maheenaa sambhavat: desh ke taaja chunavi itihaas ke sabase kade or kaante ke chunavi muqablon main se ek kaa gavaah banane ja rahaa he
 Let's put the board in place
 dillimein shanivaar ko gajipur kii khodaa colony main ek tivi fatne se do bacchon kii maut ho gai
 When Yehdsahua, both children were watching cartoons on TV in the house
 is haadase kaa shikaar hue lucky kii umr 4 saal or uske chote bhai ishu kii 3 saal thi
 The truck carrying 26 crores of goods has been mourning in the house after the robbery and his mother is crying bitterly in memory of her children again and again
 maa donon beton ke liye cartoon channel lagaakar saamaan lene bazaar chali gai thi
 At the time of the accident, there was no one other than these two innocent people in the house
 tivi main dhamaake ke baad jab kamare se dhuaan baahar aane laga to pados ke logon ne donon bacchon ko najadik ke hospital pahunchaaya, jahaan doctor ne donon ko mrit ghoshit kar diya
 10 achievements of the Kejriwal government, the entire room was set on fire due to the explosion, causing smoke and smoke there
 maa baahar se darwaja band karke gai thi, jisase bachche ghar se baahar bhi nahin nikal paae
 When the neighbors opened the door, the two children were engulfed in flames
 donon ko najadik ke laal bahadur hospital main le jaaya gaya, lekin tab tak wo dam tod chuke the
 Police have sent the bodies of both of them for postmortem and started investigation
 Can't believe it's been a year already! Never a dull moment with this one @ritssajdeh # myhappinesspic

 The Aam Aadmi Party has suffered a major setback in Punjab
 party se nilambit chal rahe vidhayak sukhpal singh khera ne party kii praathmik sadsyta se istipha de diya he
 Khaira has written his resignation letter to Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal and made many allegations
 bataa den ki beete kuch samay pehle sukhpal khera aap netritv ke khilaaf baghawat kar di thi or unako party se nilambit kar diya gaya tha
 However, Sukhpal Khaira, along with some mlas, intensified the reception against the central leadership
 haalanki, eches phulka ke baad sukhpal khera kaa istipha, loksabhaa chunaav se pehle aam aadmi party ke lihaaj se sahi nahin he
 Sukhpal Singh Khaira alleged that the party has "completely deviated" from the ideology and principles on which it was formed after the Anna Hazare movement
 party virdohi gatividhiyon main sanliptata ke chalate pichley saal november main party se nilambit kiye gaye khera ne apana tyaagptr aap ke rashtriya sanyojak arvind kejariwal ko bhej diya he
 The MLA from Bolath said in his resignation, “the current political culture of the traditional parties of the country has deteriorated due to which a lot of expectations were raised with the formation of AAP
 ” khera ne kaha, “durbhaagya se party main shaamil hone ke baad maine mahasoos kiya ki aap kaa padakram bhi paaramparik kendrikrut raajnneetik partiyon se alag nahin he
 "he has been a vocal critic of the AAP leadership since he was removed from the post of Leader of Opposition in the Punjab Assembly in July last year

 in November 2018, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) suspended Sukpal Singh Khaira and Kanwar Sandhu, who had adopted rebellion from disgruntled leaders, from the party on Saturday for allegedly indulging in 'anti-party activities'
 Had done it
 aam aadmi party kaa tark tha ki khera lagaataar party virdohi gatividhiyon main shaamil the or lagaataar kendriya or pradesh party netritv ko nishaanaa bana rahe the
 In response to his suspension from AAP, Sukhpal Khaira called the decision a "dictatorship" and said he would hold a meeting with mlas and party workers and decide on the next step
 khera khemaa aap kii punjab ikai ke liye swaittata kii maang karata rahaa he
 This camp has the support of some AAP mlas

 In this sequence, BJP leaders will meet Gujarat Governor OP Kohli on Saturday evening

 The decision made on Friday, in the presence of central observers Arun Jaitley and Saroj Pandey, was confirmed once again on Friday in the name of Vijay Rupani and Nitin Patel
 vidhayak dal kii baithak ke baad mukhyamantri ke liye duusari baar vijay roopaani or dipti siem ke liye nitin patel par bharosa kiya or unheen kaa naam final ho gaya
 However, before this, there were speculations that the BJP could implement the UP formula in Gujarat as well
 yani do up mukhyamantri banaae jane kii sambhaavna jataai ja rahi thi
 At the same time, the discussion about new names was also hot
 kendriya mantri mansukh mandavia se lekar vajubhai vaala jaise naamon par kaaphi charchaa rahi
 In 2012 too, the BJP formed the government in the state and on 20 December the government was formed
 aise main ab jald hi nai sarkaar kaa gathan ho jayega
 It is believed that on 25 December, on the occasion of Christmas, the swearing-in ceremony of the new government under the leadership of Vijay Rupani may be held

 Charanjit Channi, leader of the Congress Legislature Party in the Punjab Legislative Assembly, has quoted an RTI alleging that 6 ministers of the Punjab government are using private vehicles for their offices instead of government vehicles, and in this way their personal rather than government vehicles By using vehicles and taking claims in return, these ministers have damaged the government revenue by more than one crore 17 lakhs
 
 channi ne aarope lagaaya ki mantri apni gadiyon kii keemat se zyada to inke kiraaye kaa clem le chuke hai
 Although all this has been done under the rules, but the question arises that when the rules are also made by the government itself, then how should the ministers not benefit
 is bare main artiai se jaankaree maangi gai topunjab sarkaarake general prashasan vibhaag kii cabinet maamalon se sambandhit branch se mili jaankaree ke mutabik kai baaten saamne ain
 Ministers who earn lakhs: Sikandar Singh Maluka, Minister, Government of Punjab - took a claim of more than 45 lakhs for the use of his personal vehicle in the last 39 months
 gulzaar sinr ranike–pichley 6 maheene main 37 lakh se zyada kaa clem liya
 Surjit Kumar Jeyani - Took over 12 lakh claims in the last 8 months
 surajeet singh rakhda–pichley nau maheene main 11 lakh se zyada kaa clem
 Janmeja Singh Sekhon - Took over 6 lakh claims in the last 8 months
 sohan singh thandal–pichley teen maheenon main 4 lakh se zyada kaa clem
 If the average of the personal vehicles of all these ministers were taken out, then according to this, if the government vehicles were used, then about one crore 17 lakh rupees of government revenue could be saved
 vahiin is artiai main naam aane vaale mantriyon ne bhi apana bachaav karte hue kaha ki sarkari vaahanon kii jagah jo wo apane nijee vaahanon kaa istemaal kar rahe wo niyamon ke mutabik hi he
 At the same time, the Akali dal-bjp government defended its ministers and the government, saying that such ministers are taking claims as per the rules, which are using their private car instead of the government car and while giving this money of claim to the ministers somehow The rule has not been ignored, nor have the ministers flattened the government revenue by taking more than the claim and the Congress has forcefully called it Udda is engaged in creating
 yahaan sawaal ye he ki agar mantriyon ke liye texiyaan bhi hair kar lee jaati to bhi sarkari paise kii bachat ho sakati thi

 He was admitted to a hospital in Dubai on Monday after the sudden deterioration of the former military dictator of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf, facing charges of grave treason
 yah jaankaree unki party ol pakistan muslim lig (apimail) ne di he
 Musharraf, who had been living in Dubai for the past several years, was to record his statement in a Pakistani court on December 5
 apimail kii mahasachiv mahrin malik aadam ne kaha, 'purv raashtrapati general (sevanivrutt) parvej musharraf kii tabiyat achaanak kaaphi bighad gai, jiske baad unhen aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 His health is very poor these days and he is undergoing treatment in Dubai
 'islamabad kii ek vishesh adaalat ne musharraf ko nirdesh diya hua he ki vah sangeen rajdroh maamle main paanch disambar 2019 ko apana bayaan darj karaaen
 Musharraf was summoned several times by the special court, but he did not appear
 vishesh adaalat ne 19 november ko maamle kii sunwaayee puri kar lee thi or kaha tha ki vah 28 november ko faisla sunayegi
 After this, not only Musharraf but Pakistan's Imran government also took refuge in Islamabad High Court and appealed to the Special Court to stop the verdict
 inkaa kahana tha ki aswasth hone ke kaaran musharraf maamle main apana paksh nahin rakh sake hai
 Let them keep sides
 is par islamabad hoicourt ne adaalat ko faisla sunaane se roak diya or maamle kii sunwaayee paanch disambar se karne ko kaha
 The special court said that it would follow the instructions of the Supreme Court and the directions of the High Court did not matter to her
 lekin, iske saath hi vishesh adaalat ne faisla nahin sunaate hue, ek baar phir musharraf ko paksh rakhane kaa mauka dete hue unhen paanch disambar ko apana paksh ricard karaane kaa aadesh diya tha
 Now, just three days before this, Musharraf's health has suddenly deteriorated, in such a situation that there is very little chance of him once again putting his side
 musharraf par november 2007 main desh par 'samvidhan ke khilaaf jaakar apatkaal thopane' kaa aarope he
 In this case, death penalty can also be found if proven guilty
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne vaada kiya ki nai vastu evam seva kar jiesti vyavastha main kar kii dar tay karte samay kisi tarah kaa hairaan karne vaala faisla nahin liya jayega
 He said that the tax rates would not be significantly different from the current level
 haalanki, vitt mantri ne kaha ki companiyon ko jiesti ke tahat karon main katautee kaa laabh upabhoktaaon ko sthanantarit karnaa chahie
 The current impact of central and state duties will be eliminated by GST
 vitt mantri jetaliki aguwai vaali jiesti parishad kii 18-19 may ko srinagar main baithak hone ja rahi he jisamen vibhinn vastuon or sevaaon par kar kii daron ko antim rup diya jayega
 Earlier, at least 10 indirect taxes would be integrated into GST
 bhartiya udyog parisangh siaiai kii vaarshik baithak ko sambodhit karte hue jetali ne kaha ki jiesti ke sanchaalan ke liye sabhi niyam or niyaman taiyaar ho gaye hai
 The Finance Minister said, the formula under which this work is being done has also been told
 aise main kisi ko hairaan hone kii jarurat nahin hogi
 It will not be very different from the existing one
 jiesti parishad kendriya utpaada kar,seva kar or waite jaise shulkon ke ekikaran ke baad jiesti parishad ne chaar daron 5, 12, 18 or 28 pratishat tay kii hai
 Finance Minister Jaitley said that its fitment would be done after incorporating the full effect of the current taxation central and state duties
 uske baad kisi seva yaa vastu ko uski sabase najdiki kar ke daayre main rakhaa jayega
 The Finance Minister said that 13 meetings of the GST Council have been held so far and so far there has been no need to divide the vote on any issue
 unhone kaha ki aise main vibhinn raajnneetik dalon kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale sabhi rajya jiesti dhaanche par sahamat hue hai
 Jaitley said that the Council is of the view that the benefit due to the lower tax rates under GST should be transferred to the consumers
 vitt mantri ne kaha, laabh bura shabd nahin he, lekin anuchit rup se ye nahin liya janaa chahie
 In such a situation, consumers should get the benefit of tax reduction
 ye ek aisa siddhant he jise chunauti nahin di ja sakati
 The anti-profit provision has been added to the GST Act approved by Parliament
 jisase ye sunishchit ho sake ki karon main katautee kaa phayda upabhoktaaon ko diya ja sake

 vidhayakon ke bedroom main lagaaein sisitivibijepi ke rashtriya mantri aar pi singh ne kaha he ki kejariwal kaapane vidhayakon cegharon or daftaron main hi nahin, unke bedroom main bhi camera lagavaana chahie
 Because the way legislators treat their wives should also come to the fore

 It was accused of domestic violence
 mahila ayog ne ye maamla dilli police ke paas bhej diya he
 Even before this, AAP MLA Somnath Bharti's dispute with his wife was in the news
 maamla mahila ayog se lekar dilli police tak pahunchaa tha
 Somnath Bharti also had to go to jail in this case

 He said that it has now become clear that even Arvind Kejriwal has no confidence in his mlas
 isliye wo unke daftaron main camera lagavane kii baat kar rahe hai
 Legislators misbehave with those who come to ask for water, complain about electricity or bring their problems
 upaadhyaay ne kejariwal se sawaal bhi kiya ki apnevidhayakon kedftaron main to camera lagavane kii yaad aa gai, lekin jin 15 lakh camaron ko dilli kii sadakon par lagane kaa vaada unhone kiya tha, us vaade ko puraa karne kii yaad kab aegi? There has been a sharp response from political parties after the ongoing raids of several investigating agencies, including the CBI, in different cases

 Even my father is not left out as he criticizes the RSS and BJP government
 'aapako bataa den ki aaj bhi sibiai ne haryana ke purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ke ghar par chapa maaraa gaya he
 a strong reaction has also been expressed by the Congress on this
 congress netaa anand sharma ne kaha he ki bijepi galatfahami main na rahe ki agenciyon ke durupyog se congress ghabara jaaegi
 The Congress will answer this fiercely
 The CBI has become BBI (BJP Bureau of Investigation)
 Whoever joins hands with the BJP gets clean-chit and becomes Raja Harish Chandra & those who criticize them are hounded by agencies

 In the conversation, Gadkari explained his priorities and his thinking
 jab unase poocha gaya ki dilli aakar wo kaisaa mahasoos kar rahe hai to unhone kaha ki dilli kaa mausam unke liye thandha he
 He said that when he became the youngest President of BJP, everyone welcomed him
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki unki koi vyaktigat mahatvakanksha nahin he or naa hi unki koi ichha he ki dilli main aakar apana raajnneetik aadhaar majboot karen
 He said, 'I am a moderate worker of the party and have to work from the roots for the party
 unhone yah bhi kaha 'adhyaksh bhi vyavastha kaa hissaa hota he or main sabko saath lekar kaam karuunga
 All the people are with me and are giving me strength
 jab unase poocha gaya ki rajnath singh ko party ke andar ke hi kai logon kii vajah se kamyaabi nahin mil pai to kya unke saath bhi vaisaa hi hoga
 On this, he narrated the song 'quit Kal Ke Baat Kal Kal Kal Purani' from the film 'naya Daur' that he wants to forget old things and work afresh
 gadakari ne kaha ki party main jo kamiyaan hai use dur kiya jayega
 He also said that with the focus on development, it is necessary to strengthen discipline and maintain mutual trust
 unhone kaha ki wo yah sunishchit karenge ki party ke log party kii andruni baton kii charchaa media ke saamne na karen, aisa karnaa galat he
 Gadkari said that due to media discussion, the party is weak, so internal matters should be discussed in the party itself
 party chhodkar gaye netaaon ko waapas laane ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki wo party chhodkar jane vaale netaaon ko jodne kii koshish karenge or iske liye pradesh or party ke bade netaaon se salaah lee jaaegi
 When asked if you are influenced by the RSS, he said that he was more influenced by ABVP than the RSS

 "this leader immediately got into the question of how such a message went to the public after the two-phase polling and how to deal with it now? a senior BJP strategist says," After the first phase of elections The grand alliance created such an atmosphere that the fight was one sided, while nitish-lalu made the cancellation of the Prime Minister's rally unnecessary during the long holiday of Dussehra after the second phase
 ''lekin dashahara ke maukey ko party ne ghar-ghar saghan jansampark main lagaaya or vijayadashami ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi kii teen dinon tak tabadatod reliyaan karakar kaaryakartaaon main josh bharne kii koshish kii
 Also changed the promotional strategy
 pehle do charan main lalu prasad yadav or jangalraj ke mudde par hamalavar modi ne tisare charan ke matdaan se thik pehle mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko ahamkaari babu or tantric se hui unki mulaakaat ke mudde par sidhaa nishaanaa saadhaa
 How the bjp's top leadership is under pressure for Bihar elections can also be gauged from the fact that according to the Assembly, Prime Minister Modi himself is keeping an eye on every big and big issue and the resources required for the election
 haalanki aarakshan ke mudde par sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat kaa bayaan bihar main bijepi ke gale kii fans bana hua he
 In response to Lalu's remarks on the issue that one cannot remove Mai's Lal reservation, the Prime Minister also had to reply in the same manner that there would be no tampering of SC-ST reservation while he was alive
 ranneetik badlaav kaa asar bijepi par dikhne laga he
 "the contest for 105 seats in the third and fourth phase is unilateral," says Dharmendra Pradhan, election-in-charge of Bihar BJP and Union Petroleum Minister
 tisare charan kii voting ne hamaare liye satta kii neenv taiyaar kar di he to chauthe charan ke baad hamaari sarkaar ban jaaegi
 "bjp's national secretary Srikant Sharma adds to this comment," By coming in the fifth phase, the grand alliance will fight the leader of the opposition
 ''haalanki bijepi maan rahi he ki donon gathbandhanon kii takat saamaajik lihaaj se 30 se 35 fisadi ke bich he, lekin isamen ati pichhadaa varg nirnaayak sabit ho saktaa he
 Therefore, the party is giving preference to the leaders of that society according to the small pocket
 pehle charan kii 49 siton main bijepi kaa apana akalan 24 siton kaa he jabaki duusare charan kii 32 siton main se vah 16 se 22 siten milane kaa daawa kar rahi he
 That is, in the first two phases, the BJP itself believes that the nitish-lalu coalition is overshadowed
 lekin bijepi kii ummiido ko udaan mili he tisare charan ke matdaan se jahaan loksabhaa ke mukaable 3 fisadi zyada vot pade hai or yah kshetra sanghathanaatmak lihaaj se bijepi kaa majboot garh mana jaataa he
 Of the 50 seats in the third phase, the party is projected to get at least 32 to 35 seats
 bijepi kaa maananaa he ki duusare charan ke chunaav main endie ke sahyogi jeethanram maanjhi kaa phayda mila to tisare charan main algepi supremeo ramvilas paswan kaa
 Around 8 percent of the Dalit voters were in this phase
 tisare or chauthe charan ko hi bijepi satta kii ladaai maan rahi he
 According to the voting pattern of the Lok Sabha elections, in the total 105 seats in these two phases, the NDA got 45 per cent and the lalu-nitish-congress got 38 per cent votes apart from the separate votes received

 In this argument, the BJP is looking at its advantage, but its strategists also believe that the contest is very tough and a difference of just two per cent votes can upset the arithmetic of any coalition's power

 If these 5 symptoms are seen in children, then take them seriously and talk to the child
 jarurat ho to unhen manovaigyanik ke paas lekar jaaen or skool se bhi baat karen
 1
 baccha khoyaa-khoyaa rahata haihkhub baatcheet karne vaala baccha achaanak chup-chup rahane lage or kisi se baat karnaa use pasand naa aae to samajhen kuch gadabad jarur he
 Talk to the child, assure him that you are not separate from him and in no case you will not be angry with the child, no matter how big
 2
 Getting angry at small things: This is human psychology in which a person gets angry only when he is troubled from inside
 agar aapkaa khushmijaaj baccha aajkal har choti-choti baat par rone lagata he yaa gussa karata he to samaj len ki kuch aisa he jiske bare main aapako nahin pataa
 Talk to the child and try to know
 bachche ke skool se baat karen
 He may be misbehaving in school
 3
 Don't feel sleepy: The fact that children are not sleeping is a big sign that they are scared inside
 ise halke main naa len or turant manovaigyanik se mulaakaat karen
 Take out the fear of the child as soon as possible
 4
 Being alone: your child suddenly started being the worst bit
 akele rahane lage to bhi chintaa kii baat he
 Because children do this only when they are scared of anything inside
 5
 Avoids a particular person: If your child ignores a particular person, do not consider him or her to be small talk, nor force the child to talk to that person
 bachche ko confidence main lekar aap jaanane kaa prayaas karen ki kya vajah se jisase baccha us vyakti ko nazarandaaj kar rahaa he

 The Sangam city Allahabad will witness the biggest fair to be held on earth early next year, when from January 14 to March 10, 10 crore devotees and tourists from this country and abroad will step into this holy city
 itane bade aayojan ke liye mahaj teen maah hi bache hai, lekin bhrashtachar, laaparvaahee or kuprabandhan se jakadi taiyaariyaan isaki gavaah hai ki is desh main koi bhi bada aayojan dhaandhlee kaa daag liye bagaiyr puraa nahin ho saktaa
 Actually, preparations for Mahakumbh to be held in Allahabad after every 12 years are divided into two phases this time
 pehle charan main elahabaad shahar kaa saundaryikaran hona he to duusare charan main sangam ke aasapaas mela sthal kii taiyaariyaan puri kerani hai
 This preparation will start when the water level of ganga-yamuna will decrease after the rain
 aise main duusare charan kii taiyaari agle 15 dinon ke bheetar shuru hogi, lekin pehle charan kii taiyaariyaan kaagajon par jitne joro par chal rahi hai utani hakeekat main nahin dikhaai pad raheen
 The state government is providing 70 percent of the budget required for these preparations, while the remaining 30 percent is central government

 In the month of march-april, the exercise to widen the roads, make dividers between them and revamp the streets began
 yaheen se hi prashasnic kuprabandhan or bhrashtachar kaa sangam bhi dikhne laga
 First of all, work started on 18 crossroads of the city without widening the roads
 in kaaryon se janata ko takalif hui or jab prashasnic adhikariyon ne uski na suni to maamla elahabaad hycourt main gaya or nyaayalay ne chairahon ke nirmaan or saundaryikaran par tatkaal prabhaav se roak laga di
 The situation is that the roads carved everywhere have become the identity of the city

 90 million litre daily (emeldi) kii kshamta vaale mahadori rajapur astipi kaa nirmaan isi varsh 20 aktubar tak puraa hona tha lekin kumbh tak iske puure hone kii koi ummid nahin he
 Swami Harichaitanya, the prelate of the Shrimad Paramahamsa ashram Tikadamafi and a member of the anti-ganga pollution campaign, says, “in the last Ardh Kumbh, three crore people bathed in the Ganges and this time their number will increase more than three times
 aise main ganga ko kam-se-kam 5,000 kusek atirikt pani kii jarurat padegi
 For this, the government should try now
 ”shradghaluon kii dikkaton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue prashasan ne ganga or yamuna nadi ke kinare kul aath ghat banane kii yojana banaai or iske liye 30 karod ru

 ganga ke kinare prashasan ne teen ghaaton kaa nirmaan prastaavit kiya tha lekin yah tathy bhi saamne aayaa ki ganga kii dhara maarg badalati rahati he, aise main iske kinare ghat banane kaa koi auchity nahin he

 ab jabaki vishwa ke is sabase bade meley ke shuru hone main teen maah se kuch zyada kaa samay shesh rah gaya he, paryaton vibhaag ne is ore koi kaam nahin kiya he
 There is neither any hype about this fair on the internet nor other means
 ”varisht bijepi netaa kesharinath treepathi kehete hai, “kumbh meley kii taiyaariyon main kuch vaisaa hi bhrashtachar he jaisaa ki pichley varsh rashtramandal khelon ke dauraan saamne aayaa tha

 Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi appeared in an aggressive mood against RJD supremo Lalu Prasad and his family on Saturday

 Sushil Modi addressed the death anniversary program of former Bihar Chief Minister Jananayak Karpoori Thakur after the conclusion of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Union Conference

 Modi said that when Karpoori Thakur, who was active in politics for 50 years, died, he had a pucca house and no bank balance
 lekin unke naam kii duhai dene vaale aise log bhi hai jinhen mauka mila to 28 varsh kii umr main 30 se zyada benami sampatti ke maalik ban gaye
 Modi's reference was to RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav
 modi ne kaha ki rashtramandal sansadeey sangh sammelan main unhone ek tippanee kii ki vidhayika main bhrashtachariyon kii entry kii vajah se aaj ke din teen mukhyamantri jail kii hawa kha rahe hai
 The ruckus created by the RJD legislators during the program after this remark leads to the saying 'thork in the beard of a thief'
 kaarykram ke dauraan hangaamaa machaane vaale argedy vidhayakon se modi ne sawaal poocha ki unhen bataanaa chahie kya unke netaa lalu prasad yadav andolan yaa satyagrah kii ladaai main jail gaye hai yaa chaara ghotaale jaise bhrashtachar ke aarope main 3 court se unhen sajaa mili he jisaki vajah se vah jail kii hawa kha rahe hai?argedy ke vidhayakon ne jo susheel modi par aarope lagaaya he ki rashtramandal sansadeey sangh sammelan jaise antarrashtriya sammelan ko unhone apni raajnneeti karne ke liye istemaal kiya or bihar kii garima ko kalankit kiya he, iske jawaab main modi ne kaha ki darasal bihar ko badnaam or kalankit un logon ne kiya jinhone bihar kaa khajaana lutaa or 15 saal tak bihar ko andhere main dhakelne kaa paap kiya
 Modi said the image of Bihar has been tainted once again by the uproar caused by his mlas at international conferences in support of convicts like Lalu

 praveen ne goli lagane ke baad ghayal avasthaa main police or patna main apane ek mitra ko phone kar bachaane kii guhaar lagaai
 But he was not helped by Faridabad Police
 mritak ke saale ranjit kumaar ne aarope lagaaya tha ki agar samay par police madad mil jaati to praveen kijaan bachaai ja sakati thi
 The family members of the deceased had also alleged that after reaching Faridabad, they continued to call the Faridabad Police the location of the forest, but the police continued to trick them for 6 hours
 ab police kii hiraasat main aropiyon kaa is tarah hansanaa or saath main police waalon kaa bhi hansane main unka saath dena, unki laaparvaahee ko ujagar kar rahaa he
 The police may be arresting two accused and patting themselves on the back, but the truth is that till now the police have not been able to arrest the main conspirator Varun

 Pakistan has suffered a major setback from the World Bank
 darasal world bank ne pakistan ko 100 million dollar ke us karj ko radd kar diya he jo ek natural gas afishansi project ke liye diya janaa tha
 This decision has been taken due to Pakistan not being able to achieve the developmental goals
 sui sadarn gas company (esasgisi) karachi main apane distribution ilaakon main is pariyojna ko shuru karne vaali thi
 The objective was to increase the supply of natural gas while reducing gas losses in the pipeline system

 is bhoomika ne unhen desh kii un chand mahilaon kii qatari main shaamil kar diya jo desh main kisi technology company kii kaman sambhaal rahi hon

 There is also the name of a Brigadier, in whose house this entire conspiracy was hatched
 akhbaar kaa daawa he, ‘aatanrik mantralay kii dekharekh main karai gai jaanch ke nishkarshon ko jaanboojhkar gupt rakhaa gaya
 Even this information was hidden from the top leadership of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP)

 'the report of the letter did not say that this Brigadier is currently working in the Army or has retired
 uske naam kaa khulaasa nahin ho paaya he
 This claim of the newspaper has been rejected by Malik outright
 malik ne karachi main samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘yah puri tarah se managasaint kahani he
 this is wrong
 kisi brigadier ke ghar koi sajeesh nahin rachi gai
 In all the reports i have seen in this case so far, there is no mention of any brigadier anywhere
 ’akhbaar ke anusaar benazir ke pati jaradaari ne hi is jaanch report ko saarvajanik karne kii yojana kuch samay ke liye taal di he
 He wanted the leadership of the army to be taken into confidence first and then to allow legal action against that officer and others

 These people not only gave shelter to the attackers, but also provided all kinds of help

 a heated debate has ensued over this, everyone is making their own arguments
 is bich purv kendriya mantri faruk abdulla kaa kahana he ki islam kaaphi libral dharm he, ye kisi ko koi bhi kaam karne se nahin roktaa he
 He said that Zaira's decision to leave films is not right
 haalanki, isi ke saath faruk abdulla ne kaha ki kya pataa unke (zaayra) boyfriend yaa phir hone vaale pati ne unhen filmein chhodane ke liye kah diya ho
 Abdullah said that if i ever meet her, i will definitely tell her that she was doing a great job
 unke nirnay kii aalochana karne ke saath-saath faruk abdulla ne ye bhi kah diya ki ye unki personal chwis he
 He said that working in Bollywood does not make anyone unsupervised

 He wrote that 5 years ago i took a decision that changed my life
 lekin unhen lagata he vah imaan se bhatak gai thim, isliye vah is kshetra ko chhodane kaa faisla karti hai
 After this decision by Zaira, a heated debate started on social media
 kuch celebs ne jaayra ke nirnay ko saraahaa or kaha ki vah khud kya karnaa chaahati hai iske liye azaad hai
 So some people called quitting work in the name of religion as absurd
 jammu-kashmir ke purv mukhyamantri or faruk abdulla ke bete umr abdulla ne bhi jaayra ke faisle par twit kiya tha

 FTII Students Association (FSA) representative Ranjit Nair, who was protesting against the appointment of actor Gajendra Chauhan to the head of the institute, said a 'hunger strike' was being withdrawn to facilitate dialogue with the government
 chaatro ne kal kaha tha ki agar soochna evam prasaaran mantralay baatcheet ke liye taarikh or sthal kii pushti karata he to ve baatcheet kaa rasta saaf karne ke liye apni bhukh hadtaal waapas lene ko taiyaar hai

 (also from input language news agency) (input bhashaa samachar agency se bhi) Most of us would have dal-rice cooked in the house everyday
 kuch logon ke ghar main ye dopaher kaa mukhya aahaar hota he to kuch ke ghar main raat kaa
 But lentils and rice is something that we can eat everyday and that too without getting bored
 daal-chaaval ko pasand kiye jane kii bahut si vajahen hai
 First, its taste
 sada or mithaas bharaa
 The second and the biggest reason for liking lentils and rice is that it gets ready immediately
 kuch khaadya padaarth aise hote hanjo keval ek varg vishesh ko hi pasand aate hai, par daal-chaaval ek aisi cheez he jo har varg chaav se khaataa he
 Pulses are rich in protein, fiber and cholesterol and rice is rich in carbohydrates
 aise main ye ek healdi diet he
 Benefits of eating lentils and rice: 1
 daal main kai aise amino acids hote hai jo chaaval main nahin hote
 In such a situation, when you eat dal and rice together, you get all these nutrients
 2
 Both lentils and rice have high amounts of fiber
 ye ek supachya vyanjan he
 The presence of fiber improves digestion
 agar aap safed chaaval kii jagah brown rice kaa istemaal karte hai to ye or bhi phydemand he
 Brown rice contains essential salts such as selenium, manganese, copper, phosphorus and magnesium
 3
 There is no lack of protein in those who eat meat, but for vegetarian people, lentils are the main medium of protein
 isamen maujuud folatedil ko surakshit rakhane main bhi madadgaarhota he
 4
 aisa mana jaataa he ki chaaval khaane se vajan bad jayega
 But it is not so
 daal-chaavan khaane se kaaphi der tak pet bhare hone kaa ahsaas hota he
 Due to which there is no need to eat something throughout the day and the extra calories are not stored

 People have tried to know whether JNU has become a stronghold of drug addiction
 Over the past few years, hundreds of students have been caught drinking alcohol and cannabis at the JNU campus
 artiai ke jariye yah bada khulaasa hua he
 RTI activist Gopal Prasad of Delhi had asked the JNU administration under the Right to Information rule that between 2010 and 2016, how many students were caught in JNU while drunk and what action was taken against them? The reply from JNU Chief Information Officer and Chief Proctor's office is shocking
 artiai main aayaa javabapake sawaal ke jawaab main ham yah bataanaa chaahate hai ki saal 2010 se 2016 ke bich jeenyu main kul 300 chaatr-chatraayen sharaab, bear, ganja or duusare tamaam nashe karte hue pakade gaye
 In this reply sent by JNU administration, the names, courses and hostels of all 300 students have been named
 saath hi bataaya gaya he ki kis aarope yani kis din vah nashebaaji karte hue pakade gaye
 Highlights of the reply received from RTI - Most of the students were caught with alcohol, beer, ganja and other intoxication at midnight
 kai maamalon main jeenyu main padhane vaale chaatr-chaatra apane bahari doston ke saath college campus ke andar sharaab, bear, ganja pite pakade gaye
 In most cases, the security staff or the warden was also abused or scrambled
 open air theatre se lekar 24X7 dhaba or parking main bhi sharaab pite pakade gaye
 Some students were caught climbing on top of the Pichimabad water tank after risking their lives by drinking alcohol
 sharaab pikar nashe main tej mujeec bajaate hue kuch chaatr bhi pakade gaye
 Many students were caught drinking
 nashe main dhut hokar gaali-galouj or hangaamaa karte hue bhi kuch chaatr-chatraayen pakade gaye hai
 Most students were fined 2000 and 3000 only
 kuch maamalon main doshi chaatr-chaatraon ko ek semester ke liye nilambit bhi kiya gaya
 Some students do not leave hostels after the completion of studies
 In response given by the Chief Information Officer and Chief Proctor's Office, it has been said that a total of 537 students, including these 300, have been fined in the last 6 years

 The work of the party is not well done
 On the basis of the anti-incumbency wave, BJP has cut the ticket of all its existing councilors, the work of the same municipal corporation has been made the basis
 bijepi ne emsidi ke kaamon kaa khub bakhaan kiya he
 In which it has been talked about making many things online like property tax, map clearance, health and trade license
 to vahiin open gym or elidi lits kaa bhi zikr he
 Which BJP is counting as good works, but the big question is that if worked in MCD then who did it
 jin parshadon ne kaam kiya he usee kaa bijepi ne tikat kaat diya he
 On the other hand, to encircle the Congress, it refers to the same old corruption raga and the promises of the AAP in the assembly elections to attack the Aam Aadmi Party, which were made for five years
 lekin bijepi apane 10 saal kii satta ko chhodkar do saal ke kejariwal sarkaar ke kaamon ko gina rahi he
 The BJP has also appealed to the people in the MCD elections to win the BJP again by a huge vote in the upcoming Municipal Corporation elections
 jisase pradhanmantri modi ke sapane ko saakaar karne kii baat kahi gai he
 That is, after the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, once again in the corporation elections, the BJP will use the face of Prime Minister Modi
