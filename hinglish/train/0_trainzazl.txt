 Today the film has been released, which was waiting for a long time
 
 
 wiliam shakespeare ke mashhoor naatak 'hamelet' par aadhaarit vishaal bharadwaj kii film 'haidar' aa gai he, jisamen shahid kapur, shraddha kapur, irfan khan, tabboo, ashish vidhyaarthee or keke menon mukhya bhoomikaaon main hai
 
 
 The story of 'haider' is set against the backdrop of Kashmir of 1995, where terrorists have terror on one side and army fear on the other side
 
 
 yahaan 'haidar' apane mata-pita ke saath rahata he
 
 
 'haider''s father is a doctor, and his mother plays Tabu
 
 
 'haidar' ke chachaa bane hai keke menon, jo peshey se vakil dikhaae gaye hai
 
 
 The terrorist from across the border does not surround 'haider', so his parents send him to Aligarh to study, but when he returns from there, he sees that his house is destroyed, the father is missing, And the mother is preparing to marry her uncle
 
 
 iske aage kii kahani aapako paise kharch karke dekhni padegi
 
 
 Now let's talk about the shortcomings and merits of the film
 
 
 vishaal bharadwaj ne bahut khubsuurati ke saath 'hamelet' ko film kaa rup diya he
 
 
 Beyond the drama, the film thrives on the screen like a real story
 
 
 kashmir kii haalat 'haidar' kii kahani ke jariye jis tarah vishaal ne bayaan kii he, vah aapako hairaan kar saktaa he, kyonki yah film drishyon ke alaava manahosthiti ke saath zyada khelti he
 
 
 However, you may be forced to peep into the characters more than their faces, because every moment of the film has been executed by Vishal Bhardwaj very closely
 
 
 film kii gati aapako dhimi lag sakati he, kyonki yahaan kai seens main kirdaaron kii shaareerik kam, maansik gatividhiyaan zyada hai
 
 
 However, i think Vishal could have created such scenes in some way, so that the audience would be able to connect better, because after some time the film starts lengthening
 
 
 film main shahid kapur or shraddha kapur ke bich filmaaya gaya ek gaanaa he, jo film ke ek khaas bhaag main aapako bematlab lag saktaa he
 
 
 Actor Irrfan Khan is in the guest role, but his entry and acting are bang
 
 
 irfan kaa kirdaar ruhani he, or yah sochane par bhi majaboor kar detaa he ki unke darje kii acting karnaa shaayad hi kisi ke bas main ho
 
 
 Shahid's father's character Narendra Jha is impressive
 
 
 tabboo kii parformens to kamaal kii he hi, shahid ne bhi kamaal kaa abhinay kiya he
 
 
 Now let's talk about the songs of the film
 
 
 yun to gulzaar ne saare hi gane behtareen likhe hai, lekin khaastaur par 'bismil
 
 
 'looked very impressive
 
 
 is geet ko jitna acha gulzaar ne likhaa he, utani hi khubsuurati se sukhwinder ne ise gaaya he, or sudesh ne is par kamaal kii koreography kii he
 
 
 Shahid Kapoor is an amazing dancer, but in this song i felt his dance performance so far, because he never misses the mood and steps
 
 
 shraddha kapur bhi in sabhi ke bich apane kirdaar ke saath nyaay karti hai, lekin ashish vidhyaarthee jaise actor ko film main zyada istemaal nahin kiya gaya
 
 
 KK Menon is alright, though his gestures sound the same as in every film of his
 
 
 darshakon ko yah bataanaa mujhe behad zaruri lag rahaa he ki agar aapako 'haidar' se masaaledaar antertaning film jaisi ummiden he, to aap niraash ho sakate hai, kyonki yah film unke liye he, jinhen tehraav or eemaandaaree se kahi jane vaali kahaniyaan pasand aati hai
 
 
 i have rated this film - 3
 5 star

 aksar bahut bada aadmi ban jane ke baad kuch sapane hamaara peechha nahin chhodte
 One such dream was following CA Amit Chopra from Bangalore
 ye sapana tha ek bada bijnesaman banane kaa
 Know how Amit, after pursuing his dream, set up his company as CA
 utaar-chadhaav ke daur ko paar karke kaise aaj kar rahe karodon main kamai
 Amit was doing well in his career as a Chartered Accountant
 yahi nahin wo lakhon rupee main kamai kar rahe the
 But there was a dream that made him feel empty
 wo apane man kaa kariyar chaahate the or man chahta tha bijnesaman bananaa
 Just one day he decided to live his dream and quit his CA job
 naukari chhodkar khud kaa bijness shuru kiya
 Started his own company for this
 'kesar international' naam se company kaa registration karaayaa jo construction fermon ko steel angel, jost, beam, rod, baar jaise steel utpaada uplabdh karaati he
 Today his company's turnover is more than 10 crores
 pehle nahin pataa tha karnaa kya he
 
 
 Speaking to your story website, Amit said that earlier he himself did not know what to do
 vah kehete hai ki main bas ek aisa bijness shuru karnaa chahta tha, jisamen jokhim kam ho
 Just in this direction, i started doing research
 is dauraan maine dekha tha ki steel sector ek aisa kshetra he, jo teji se aage bad rahaa tha
 And i took the decision that i know that steel production in the country is continuously increasing
 india brands equity foundation ke aankadon ke anusaar, 2018 main 106
 India was the second largest steel producer in the world in 2018 with a production of 5 million tonnes
 in sab research ke baad maine isi field main bijness shuru karne kaa faisla liya
 In a year, the company made this earnings Amit says that i have realized that construction companies have to source all the products of constructive steel from here
 isse unhen dikkat kaa saamana ho rahaa tha
 Despite having the capacity to purchase it, they could not find steel products of the right choice
 maine faisla kiya ki main ek hi platform par ye sabhi product awel karaungaa
 That is when the foundation of the company was laid
 ab nahin he wo bhatkarmit bataate hai ki saal 2018 main unhone is company kii shuruyaat kii
 Now we provide steel products like steel angle, jost, beam, road, bar, etc
 directly to the construction firms
 unhone kaha ki unki company kii kamai se zyada jaruri he wo santosh jo unhone kamaaya he
 Now he is not as distracted as before

 (input bhashaa se) The Congress, which has so far refrained from directly attacking the SP over the communal violence in Muzaffarnagar district of Uttar Pradesh, has demanded the resignation of the state Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav

 Steps have been taken to prevent the effects of local air pollution around the Taj Mahal — for example, vehicles have been banned near its premises, more than 200 industries have been shut down in Agra, iron casting Scrubbers have been required to install scrubbers (gas removal purifiers) and filters on their smoke chimneys, with new polluting industries within the buffer zone surrounding the mausoleum
 It went banned Gon and that recently went banned burning food Kande dung as cooking fuel

 Keeping this in mind, the researchers began investigating the ambient air in and around the Taj Mahal
 unke adhyayanon ne dikhaaya ki taj mahal ke badrang hone kii vajah baarik kanon—kaala carbon (kajli), bhura carbon or dhul kii paraton—kaa baari jamaav tha
 Most of these came from the activities of the people in the city — especially burning biomass, or burning the city's solid waste in the open, burning wood and cow dung and stubble burning — besides diesel emissions and smoke There were also spill vehicles

 uttar pradesh main bijepi kii sarkaar banane ke baad mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne pradesh kii sabhi sadakon ko 15 june tak gaddha-mukt karne kaa bharosa dilaayaa tha
 This deadline now has only 15 days left
 aise main 'aaj tak' ne upi kii sadakon ke reality check ke jariye jaanane kaa prayaas kiya ki is disha main ab tak kitni pragati hui
 For this, the 'aaj Tak' team reviewed the roads in Lakhimpur Kheri, Barabanki, Chandauli and Allahabad
 lakhimpur khirirashtriya rajmarg 724 dilli ko pilibhit, lakhimpur, baharich, ayodhya, basti ke raste assam tak jaataa he
 Visiting the Dhaurahra tehsil area of lakhimpur-kheri district can be clearly seen that the roads are in ruins
 yahaan gadde itane khatarnaak hai ki aae din haadason ko nyotaa dete rahete hai
 The 'aaj Tak' team saw the plight of a truck stuck in a big pit
 trek kaa driver is musiibat se baahar nikalne ke liye duusare trek or rasse kii madad letaa dikhaa
 The driver of the truck said that there are so many pits here that even driving becomes a problem
 kachua chaal se hi trek ko aage badhanaa padataa he
 The driver of the roadways bus leading to Nepal also says that due to these broken roads, the passengers of Nepal get a chance to sarcasm
 sadak kaa istemaal karne vaale sthaneey nagarikon kaa bhi kahana he ki yahaan itane gadde hai ki inaki vajah se vaahan aae din kharaab hote rahete hai
 They also say that by June 15, they expect the roads to be completely pitched
 barabankibarabanki ke bashindon ke mutabik 15 june tak sadakon kaa 'gaddha mukt' hona dur kii kaudi hi najar aata he
 Many important roads of Barabanki are still full of pits
 neshnal haive 28 se bas adda, kachhari or railway stesan ko jodne vaale maarg kii haalat beete ek saal se kharaab he
 On this route, all types of drivers like bikes, cars, rickshaws, etc
 have to face difficulties
 logon ke pradarshan ke baavjood is sadak kii haalat nahin sudhari
 In order to know the condition of the streets of Nagar Panchayat Banki, till today, the team reached there, there were only pits on the road
 in sadakon ko durust karne kii jimmedaari nagar panchayat banki kii he
 But chairman Anshu Singh does not know when the tender has come and when the work will start and end
 unase jab poocha gaya to unka kahana tha ki tender ho gaya to gaddha mukt karne kaa kaary 10 taarikh se shuru ho jaayegaa or 15 taarikh tak khatm karne kii koshish kii jaayegi
 At the same time, the Executive Officer of Nagar Panchayat Premnath claimed that in a day or two, the work of ridding these roads will start
 chandauli15 june tak sadakon ko gaddha mukt karne ke vaade kii jamini hakeekat jaanane ke liye 'aaj tak' team ne chandauli kaa rukh kiya to vahaan bhi sadakon kii haalat khastahal hi dikhi
 In the Mughalsarai area of chandauli, the home district of Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, a 12-kilometer road from Dulipur to Sahupuri, Vyasnagar to Ramnagar was reviewed, then there were pits
 jab aasapaas rahane vaale graminon se poocha gaya to unka jawaab tha ki pichley do dashak se is sadak kii kisi ne sud nahin lee
 According to the local citizen Ramnath Prasad, the condition of the road is so bad that if the passersby do not move, they fall and get injured
 ramnath ne kaha ki bade-bade adhikari bhi is sadak se aate-jate hai lekin isaki dasha nahin sudhari
 The condition of roads in Allahabad and Kaushambi also seems unlikely given that their craters are free by June 15
 kaushambi kii manori road bade-bade gaddhon main tabdeel ho gai he
 It is always full of water
 logon kaa nikalnaa dubhar he
 Local citizens say that the rotation of a magic wand can improve the condition of roads here by June 15, otherwise it seems unlikely
 (lakhimpur khiri se abhishek verma, barabanki se saiyad rehaan mustafa, chandauli se udai gupta or elahabaad se pankaj shrivastav ke inputs ke saath) India may have reached a losing position in the second Test cricket match against England but opener Gautam Gambhir still hopes for a miracle
 gambhir abhi ek chor par tike hue hai
 He is playing unbeaten 53 runs
 unhone kaha ki isse pehle bhi bharat is tarah kii paristhitiyon se baahar niklaa he
 He recalled the 2004 Test match played against Australia at the same ground in which India had bowled the visiting team for 93 after chasing a target of 111 runs
 gambhir ne kaha, ‘chamatkaar hote rahete hai
 Things change completely
 yadi ham acha score bana lete hai to kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 You will remember here the Test match in which Australia were dismissed for 70 or 80 runs
 vah meraa pehla test match tha
 "he said," Tomorrow we will try and the positive thing is that we have three wickets left
 yadi hamaari ek saajhedaari ho jaati he or ham unhen 120-130 ran kaa lakshya dete hai to match jeevant ban jayega
 If we can score 113 runs for seven wickets then we can all out them too
 ve bhi ye ran banane ke liye sangharsh karenge
 The important thing is that we have to give a good score for the bowlers' defense
 ’’gambhir jis match kii baat kar rahe hai usamen is match main khel rahe bharat kii teen spinneron main se ek harbhajan singh ne paanch jabaki baayen haath ke spinner murali karthik ne teen wicket liye the
 India won the match after trailing by 99 runs in the first innings
 unhone kaha, ‘meraa maananaa he ki unhone (panesar or swaan) hawa main adhik teji se gend karaayi
 When you are getting help from the wicket and you accelerate the ball in the air, some balls spin and some go straight
 ’gambhir ne kaha, ‘‘mujhe lagata he ki hamane kuch avasaron par hawa main teji se gend karaayi jabaki kuch maukon par dhimi karaayi
 There is a turn and bounce in this wicket and in this Monty and Swan got us in trouble by having the ideal fast ball
 hamen bhi turn or oochaal mil rahi thi
 Only the boom made a big difference
 ’’gambhir ne bhartiya spinneron kaa paksh liya
 He said, 'I would not say that their spinners bowled better than our spinners
 yadi aap elistare cook or kevin petersan kii saajhedaari ko hataa do to unke anya ballebaajon ne koi khaas yogadan nahin diya
 This proves that our bowlers also bowled well
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘main yah kahuunga ki monti ne ojha kii tulana main acchhee gendbaaji kii
 He was getting extra bounce
 ’ Significantly, Malishka made a song a few days ago about BMC in a video showing the condition of pits and traffic on the streets of Mumbai
 darasal, malishka ne online video main ek geet - 'mumbai tula biemasi var bharosa naay kaa (mumbai 
 
 
 Do you not believe BMC) 'sarcasm on the metropolis here
 yah video unke offis main hi shoot kiya gaya tha
 In this Marathi song, BMC has been blamed for these problems, citing traffic, dirt and rain in Mumbai
 is video ko soshal media par lakhon log dekh chuke hai or vibhinn tarah se biemasi or shivasena kii karypranali par kataaksh kiye gaye hai
 The song is inspired by the famous Marathi folk song "sonu Tuja Mayawar Bharosa Nahi Kaai"

" ' imran ne iske jawaab main kaha, 'yah sarkaar america kii naukar he jo americanyon ke juute main paalish kar rahi he
 Imran urged US Ambassador Richard Olson to send his message to the US State Department and asked if Pakistanis were children of a small god

 This year, the first aircraft from Bhopal to Saudi Arabia to take Haj pilgrims will fly on 17 September
 madhyapradesh haj cameti ke adhyaksh sanwwar patel ne kaha, ‘is varsh haj tirth yatriyon ko le jane liye bhopal se saudi arab ke liye kul milakar paanch vimaan 17 sitambar se 21 sitambar tak udaan bharenge
 These planes will carry 1,200 passengers in total
 harek vimaan main 240 yatri honge
 He said that the Haj Committee of India along with the officials of Indian Airlines and Saudi Airlines has prepared a program to take Haj pilgrims from Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh
 patel ne bataaya ki 21 sitambar ke baad indore hawaondde se yatriyon ko haj par le jane ke liye ab tak unhen koi kaarykram nahin mila he
 He said, 'both Indian Airlines and Saudi Airlines have agreed to provide good facilities to the pilgrims
 ’ If all goes well, before the Lok Sabha elections, the Modi government will implement the UBI i
e
 Universal Basic Income Scheme across the country
 is yojana ke lagu hone ke baad kisaan, vyapaaree or berozegaar yuvaaon ko har maheene 2,000 se 2,500 rupee tak kii nishchit rakam milegi
 This plan of Modi government can prove to be a game changer
 lekin aisa nahin he ki berozegaron ko paise dene kii yah yojana pehali baar kisi desh main lagu hoga
 Such schemes have been in operation in countries like France, Germany and Japan for years
 aaj ham aapako is report main kuch aise hi deshon ke bare main bataane ja rahe hai jahaan is tarah kii yojana lagu he
 According to the report of the French Guardian, France is the place in Europe where the unemployed get the most facilities
 agar 2017 ke aankadon par gaur karen to yahaan berozegaron ko sarkaar salanaa kareeb 7 hajaar euro (5
 6 lakh)
 yani maheene ke hisaab se 46 hajaar rupee kaa bhatta miltaa he
 However, the unemployed also get this allowance with certain conditions
 germanyisi tarah germany main bhi kai str par berozegaron ko pement di jaati he
 The unemployed living alone can take around 390 Euros per month (about 30 thousand rupees)
 haalanki berozegaar shaks teen maah tak kaam nahin dhundta he to unka pement apane aap 30 fisadi tak gata diya jaataa he
 irelandareland has several stringent regulations to provide facilities to the unemployed
 masalan, aapako kam se kam 7 din tak berozegaar hona chahie
 In addition, the Department of Social Protection must state that you are 'competent for work'
 iske alaava aapkaa soshal insurance main countribution bhi hona chahie
 According to italyreport, the unemployment rate in Italy is 12
 9 fisadi he
 In 2013 the Government of Italy replaced unemployed benefits
 ab berozegaron ko kuch sharton ke saath yahaan 1,180 euro prati maah (kareeb 90 hajaar rupee) milte hai
 At the same time, in Japan, the government helps in the situation of physical or learning disability as well as mental health
 japan main yah rakam kareeb 153 pound prati maah (kareeb 15 hajaar rupee) he
 Where the idea came from in India, Modi government can implement some similar universal basic income scheme
 is skim kaa suzav sabase pehle landan uniwarsity ke professor gaay standing ne diya tha
 He was led by a pilot project for five years in 8 villages in Indore, Madhya Pradesh
 prayog ke tahat in gaanvon kii 6,000 kii aabaadi ko phayda pahunchaaya gaya
 500 per month was deposited in the account of these villagers
 vahiin bacchon ke khate main 150 rupee jamaa karaae gaye
 About 100 million people can be covered under this scheme in India
 saal 2016-17 ke aarthik survey main sarkaar ko is skim ko lagu karne kii salaah di gai thi
 The election of the next President of the country is yet to be held, but the Railways has started the new saloon process for the visit of the new President at a cost of eight crores
 aapako bataate chalem kiraashtrapatike bhraman yaa yatra ke liye ek khaas train hoti he jise salon kaha jaataa he
 The saloon has all the special and modern facilities
 railway is pariyojna ko manjuuri ke liye nae raashtrapati ke paas july main bhejega
 The saloon that currently exists is of 1956 and has included 87 visits from the country's first president, Dr

 narendra modi or nitish kumaar jaise netaaon kii branding kar unako desh videsh main chamakaa chuke pike yani prashanth kishor kii class ab uttarakhand main bhi lagane lagi he
 With a huge team and laptops in hand, PK has now taken over the reins of Uttarakhand
 unki pehali paathshaala haridwar main lagi he, jahaan khud harish ravat kii beti or patni donon hi haath aajmaana chaahati hai
 It is being said that this time the election of the Congress is going to be completely digital and Prashant Kishore himself has taken charge of all this
 mana jaataa he ki modi ke liye kaam karne vaale prashanth kishor ne mote paise lekar us vakt kaam kiya tha lekin harish ravat kah rahe hai ki wo ek sahyogi ke taur par hi pradesh main congress ko seva de rahe hai
 On the other hand, the number of such leaders is also constantly increasing, who want to stay away from pk's spin
 pike kii phiraki, harish kaa bharosasibiai kaa shikanja or 10 apane vidhayakon ke baagi hone ke baad harish ravat sahit puure pradesh congress ko lagata he ki is baar kaa chunavi sangram bahut kathin hone vaala he
 The effect of Modi's wave on him is also being seen in many seats in the state, hence Harish Rawat has given Prashant Kishore, who is playing a role for the management guru and party in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, to the Congress's Doli Naiya in his state too
 Has called for crossing
 apane hi logon main ghir chuke harish ravat ko lagata he ki ab prashanth kishor kaa anubhav hi pradesh main unako bachaa saktaa he
 If Harish Rawat is believed, then the way Prashant had planned to put Modi on the power of the country in 2014, if he does here too, the atmosphere can be in favor of Harish Rawat to a large extent
 ravat kaa kahana he ki modi ke liye unako hair kiya gaya tha, lekin yahaan wo sirf seva kii bhaavana se aaye hai
 Kishore dislikes Kishore? If sources are to be believed, Kishore Upadhyay does not want anyone else in the state to participate in the election game of the Congress, but if the party has to follow the command of the high command, then Kishore is also forced to join the tone of PK
 upaadhyaay kii maane to agar pike rajya main seva kii bhaavana se aaye hai to kuch acha hi hoga
 The state president says that after the government comes to the state, the cooperation of PK will not be forgotten
 pike or unka management1977 main bihar ke sahibabad main janmen prashanth kishor ke lohe ko desh ne tab mana jab unhone 2014 main narendra modi ke liye kaam kiya
 Political consultant PK has also worked for Nitish Kumar
 isse pehle wo priyanka gandhi ke saath bhi kaam kar chuke hai
 PK does the same from writing speeches of leaders in whichever state and for whom they work, from managing posters, banners, slogans and rallies
 media se duriuttarakhand main bhi prashanth kishor ne pichley 5 din se deraa daalaa hua he, subah 11 baje se lekar wo alag-alag jagahon par pradesh congress ke mukhya chehron kii paathshaala laga rahe hai
 Prashant Kishore, while brainstorming with all the leaders, has made it clear that his strategy should not go out at all, especially the media does not

 The Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) has filed a complaint with the BCCI and IPL against Rajasthan Royals captain Shane Warne
 warn par aarope he ki unhone anukool pich muhaiyaa karaane kaa unka aagrah nahin maanane par aaarasie sachiv sanjay dikshit ko saarvajanik taur par apshabd kahe the
 RCA alleged that Warne had misbehaved with Dixit for not fulfilling his demand after Rajasthan Royals' humiliating nine-wicket defeat to Royal Challengers Bangalore in a home match on Wednesday night
 warn pehle hi ghoshnaa kar chuke hai ki vah is ipel ke baad khilaadi ke taur par is twanti-20 lig se sanyas le lenge
 RCA venue director Narendra Joshi has written to IPL Chief Operating Officer Sundar Raman in which he accused Warne of using abusive words for Dixit in public and calling him a liar and a scandal
 joshi ne is purv australian cricketer ke khilaaf karrwai karne kii maang kii
 The incident took place immediately after the award distribution ceremony at Sawai Mansingh Stadium
 sutron ne aarope lagaaya ki haar se niraash warn dikshit ke paas gayi or unke sandesh kaa jawaab nahin dene ke liye unhen apshabd kahe
 He tells Dixit to be a liar, boastful and leave from there

 He also apologized for the incident
 sutron ne bataaya ki dikshit ne bisisiai ke paas un sandeshon ko bheja he jo warn ne lagaataar unhen bheje the
 When contacted, Dixit said that Warne's behavior was probably due to the disappointment of the team's relentless defeat
 in haar se rajasthan rails kaa play aaf main jagah banane kii sambhaavna lagbhag samaapt ho gayi he
 Dixit questioned, the BCCI has already cleared the pitch that the pitch falls under the purview of the committee and curator
 isliye uski maang ko kaise sweekaar kiya ja saktaa he
 His behavior was totally inappropriate and i have asked for action against him
 shilpa shetty vahaan pahunchi or unhone sthiti sanbhali
 Warne was troubled by two consecutive defeats at home ground at the hands of Chennai Super Kings and RCB as he believed that Rajasthan Royals could take advantage of home conditions by changing the pitch after a seven-wicket loss to Mumbai Indians last month and then criticizing Sachin Tendulkar
 flop down
 rajasthan rails ko dhimi pichen pasand hai jinamein gend nichi rahati he lekin tendulkar kii tippanee ke baad bisisiai ne apni maidan or wicket samiti ke adhyaksh venkatsundaram ko jaipur bhejkar unhen is maidan par hone vaale ipel ke baaki maichon ke liye nayaa wicket taiyaar karne ke liye kaha tha

 johny liver, lakshmikant berde, raajapaal yadav or is film ke pappi ji na ho to shaadiyon vaali filmon kii baat nahin banati
 The same Pappi ji, who missed out on getting something in life, but always present to live with
 har ghar main home delivery kii tarah
 He used to sing at other weddings and yearn for his marriage
 pappi ji ne rang jamaa diya
 And Singh Sahib of Rampur was reminded of Ranjhana
 banarsi ke baad ab rampuri ban kar us kaaiyaanpane ko nibhaa gaye, jise odhe aaj bhi hamamen se kai dusron ke liye khatmal bane rahete hai
 Wedding is the biggest dream and festival of Hindustani society
 sabakaa anubhav ek sa he
 It is a strange ritual
 itani kadavaahaton ke buniyaad par rachi jaati he, magar usamen se bhi sabake liye apaar khushiyon or yaadon kaa mauka nikal hi aata he
 Whether it is marriage or reconciliation
 bengali baba kaa board bataata he ki shaadi ke bheetar kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan aaj tak koi nahin dhund sakaa he
 Therefore, there is something else about films with weddings
 lagata he ki hamaare ghar kii kahani chal rahi he
 From shopping at London's super market Tesco's cell to Kanpur's Birhana Road
 ham or aap jitne bhi mahanagareey ho jaaen, dil ke bheetar basaa to vahi gaanv kasbaa he na
 Nostalgia does not always occur in the past tense
 vartmaan kaal kii bhi hoti he
 We have just left Kanpur Patna and gone to London Paris and have just brought a mango pickle from there
 ye filmein bhi ek chitthee kii tarah hamaari zindagi kii ek shaam main aa jaati hai
 Like someone knocked on the door of an old closed house and someone came in before saying 'who is'
 hamaare sapanom ne hamase zindagi hi le lee
 Where is the place left for each other to come home early or spend an evening of two moments
 ye to sabaki niyati he, tabhi to sabko ye film bhi acchhee lagi
 Loved or used to live
 puuchhuun to sach-sach bataaoge kaa yaa boluun datto yaa landan ritern vaali ko
 If you are not in the mood to leave movies loaded with the burden of big stories, then Tanu Weds Manu can watch
 yah aisi film to he hi ki dekhte dekhte saath vaali kii ungliyaan tham lete hai
 Slightly puffing each other with shoulder to shoulder
 or kya chahie
 The job of millions has made life depressed
 do sau rupee ke tikat kii ek film hansaa de to sauda sasta hi hua na
 The comments hamaare sahyogi brijabhooshan shukla se hi film shuru ho jaaegi ye to maine sochaa hi nahin tha
 Swara Bhaskar is also starting to look like a neighbor
 koi naaz nakhra nahin
 Play the character
 tum koun ho bhul jaao
 Haryanvi Bhai Saab, you have given Haryana a good lecture, so thank you
 rahi baat dear kangana kii, to sab to tarif kar hi chuke hai
 Look, Kangana does not know how to act
 vah to bas har kirdaar ke angan main jaakar khadi ho jaati hai
 The sight of the beholder starts acting while looking at them
 soch rahaa hum kanpur main firangan banakar masti karne vaali kangana acchhee he yaa yallo tii-shart vaali datto
 Hey, i will weigh with the scales
 chal film dekh or nikal
 If Twitter, Facebook will do so throughout the day, there will be a craving for similar films
 ab do sau rupee main yaa to kanpur kaa tikat kataa le yaa phir ye film dekh le
 What is the name of the film? tanu vaids manu ritern
 Who should talk big things
 tanu vaids manu ritern dekhakar hansi ruk sake to roak lenaa ji
 Johnny Lever, Laxmikant Berde, Rajpal Yadav and if Pappi ji is not there in this film, then films with weddings do not become a thing
 vahi pappi ji, jo zindagi main kuch paane se chook gaye, magar saath nibhaane ko hameshaa maujuud
 Like Home Delivery in Every Home
 dusron kii shaadiyon main gaate bajaate rahe or apni shaadi ke liye tarasate rahe
 Pappi Ji added color
 or rampur ke singh sahab ranjhna kii yaad dilaa gaye
 After Banarsi, now Rampuri has become a part of that work, which many of us still remain bedbug for others
 shaadi hindustani samaaj kaa sabase bada sapana or tyohaar he
 Everyone's experience is the same
 ajeeb rasm he
 So much bitterness is built on the foundation, but out of that comes an opportunity for immense happiness and memories for everyone
 chaahe shaadi mail milaap se ho jaae yaa kundali milan se
 Bengali Baba's board says that to date no one has been able to find solutions to the problems within the marriage
 isliye shaadiyon vaali filmon kii baat hi kuch or hoti he
 The story of our house seems to be going on
 landan ke super market tesco ke cell se karidaari se lekar kanpur kaa birhaana road
 Whether we and you become a metropolitan city, it is the same town inhabited within the heart
 nostaljia hameshaa bhoot kaal main nahin hoti he
 It is also of the present tense
 abhi-abhi to ham kanpur patna chhodkar landan paris gaye hai or abhi-abhi to vahaan se aane vaala koi aam kaa achaar le aayaa he
 These films also come like a letter in one evening of our life
 jaise kisi ne puraane band pade ghar kaa daravaaza khatkhataya ho or 'koun he' bolne se pehle koi andar aa gaya ho
 Our dreams took life away from us
 ek duusare ke liye jaldi ghar aane yaa do pal kii shaam bitaa lene kii bekaraari kii jagah kahaan bachi he
 This is everyone's destiny, that's why everyone liked this film too
 pyaar karte ho yaa karte the ji
 If i ask, i will tell the truth or speak to Datto or London Returns
 badi kahaniyon ke boj se laden hue filmein nikalne kaa mood na ho to tanu vaids manu dekh sakate hai
 This is such a film that while watching, the fingers of the person are held together
 thodaa kandhe se kandhaa ladaakar ek duusare ko gudguda lete hai
 what do you want more
 lakhon kii naukari ne jivan ko udhaas kar diya he
 If a film with a ticket of two hundred rupees was made, then the deal was not cheap
 tippaniyan i did not even think that the film will start with our colleague Brij Bhushan Shukla
 swara bhaskar bhi padosan kii tarah lagane lagi hai
 There is no tantrums
 kirdaar he kirdaar ko nibhaao
 Forget who you are hariyaanvi bhai saab aapane haryana ko acha lacture pilaayaa he so aapkaa to shukriya banataa he na
 Dear Kangana, this thing has been praised
 dekho ji, kangana ko to acting aati hi nahin he
 She simply stands in the courtyard of each character
 dekhne vaale kii nigaah unhen dekhte hue acting karne lagati he
 Thinking Kangana is good or fun with yellow T-shirt, having fun as a Firangan in Kanpur
 are ib taraazoo lekar taulega ke
 Watch the movie and get out
 din bhar twitor, fasebuk karegaa to aisi hi filmon ke liye tarasegaa
 Now for two hundred rupees, either cut the ticket to Kanpur or watch this movie
 naam kya he re film kaa

 haalanki, sapa se unka rishta zyada nahin tik paaya or ajam khan kaa vajood un par baari pad gaya
 Azam Khan returned to the SP, while both Amar Singh and Jaya Prada had to look out
 iske baad amar singh ne rashtriya lokmanch banaaya or choudhary ajit singh kii rashtriya lokdal ke saath uskaa vilay kar liya
 In 2014, Jaya Prada contested from Bijnor Lok Sabha seat of UP on the Rashtriya Lok Dal ticket, but she was defeated badly
 amar singh ke saath jaya pradahalanki, jaya pradaa kaa raajnneetik kariyar sapa va areldi main aane se pehle hi shuru ho gaya tha
 At the age of 32, in 1994, she joined the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) of Andhra Pradesh on the call of NT Rama Rao (NTR)
 do saal baad hi 1996 main tidipi ne jaya pradaa ko rajyasabha saansad bana diya
 She was annoyed if she was not nominated to the Rajya Sabha again
 iske baad 2004 main jaya pradaa ne samaajawaadee party jwine kar lee
 It is said that Amar Singh played an important role in joining Jaya Prada to SP
 is raajnneetik safar se pehle filmi kariyar dhalaan par aane se pehle jaya pradaa ne parde par khub naam kamaaya
 Career started with Telugu films On April 3, 1962, in Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh, Jaya Prada was born to the film world, Krishna Rao
 skool kii padhai ke saath hi unhone dance or mujeec kii class lenaa bhi shuru kar diya
 As a result, at the age of 13, when a school director was spotted on his school stage performance, he offered a three-minute dance song to Jaya Prada in a Telugu film
 iske liye jaya pradaa ko 10 rupee mili
 But the care that his film journey got from here, he went on to earn a big name in Bollywood
 film sargam se bollywood main entrisal 1979 main ai film sargam se unhone bollywood main entry kii
 The film became a big hit
 haalanki, bollywood main jaya pradaa ko bada brakethru saal 1984 main ai film 'tohfa' ne dilaayaa
 Jaya Prada's film with Jitendra and Sridevi was well received, which brought her to stardom
 vivaadon main jaya pradaafilmi kariyar main tarakkee paane vaali jaya pradaa ne 1986 main mashhoor film diarector shrikant nahata se shaadi kii
 The relationship of the two was also the center of discussion
 shaadi se pehle jaya pradaa or shrikant nahata ke rishton kii media main khub charchaa hoti thi
 Because Nhata was married
 yahi baat vivaad kii badi vajah bhi bani kyonki nahata ne apni pehali patni ko talaak die bina hi jaya pradaa se shaadi kii
 During the election campaign, Jaya Prada became the center of controversy after politics
 jab duusari baar tidipi ne unhen rajyasabha ke liye nahin bheja to jaya pradaa ne khule taur par virodh kiya or party kii duusari netaaon ko tarjeeh milane ke aarope lagaate hue apni naaraazgi jaahir kii
 The real controversy of Jaya Prada's life was seen in Rampur itself, when Azam Khan openly opposed him
 jaya pradaa ne yahaan tak iljaam lagaae ki ajam khan ne rampur main unki ashleel tasviren bantwain
 Now that she is contesting once again from Rampur seat, there is a war of words between Azam Khan and her
 jaya pradaa bijepi or ajam khan sapa ke tikat par aamane-saamne hai

 a recent study suggests that girls' breakup emotionally troubles girls more than boys
 haalanki research maanate hai ki jab ladkiyaan brallep ke phej se baahar aa jaati hai to wo zyada strong ho jaati hai
 Conversely, the boys move quickly but are never able to recover fully
 apane aasapaas yaa phir aapane khud is tarah ke kai cese dekhen honge
 Let us know how to handle ourselves after the breakup, whether it is about boys or girls
 
 
 1
 Let's say that now that everything is over instead of becoming an emotional flower, the sooner you believe that now that your relationship is over, the sooner you will be able to come out of this pain
 aksar brallep kaa hona sahi hi hota he or is baat se aapako deal karnaa hoga
 After crying a lot, you said to yourself that you have to be happy now because there is a lot to be done in life
 padhein :jab pyaar doosraa mauka den to kya karen
 
 
 2
 khud ko sanbhalane ko samay denimotions kokai baar sanbhalanaamushkil ho jaataa he lekin iskaa ye matlab bilkul nahin he ki aap ise apni kismat maan ke baith jaaen
 Give yourself time to get out of this situation, as if you will manage yourself completely in one month or in the next three months or six months
 jab aap khud ko samay se baandh lenge to khud ba khud aapako is kii chintaa rahegi
 By doing this you will feel quite well
 3
 Remove not only the heart but also from social media, anyone can be removed from your x Kodil in any way, but in today's time, social media will remind you by removing a link from somewhere
 aise main apane eks ko har site se an follow kar den
 Delete the number from the phone list
 aisa karke aapako thodi der kaa dukh hoga lekin sach maniye aage chalakar aap relex feel karenge
 Also read: Anushka, not Deepika, because of this every girl can breakup
 
 
 4
 Once again, we have full opportunity to give ourselves time, we often ignite ourselves in the circle of loving and cherishing others
 agar aapane bhi khud ke saath aisa kiya he to ab time aa chukaa he ki khud ko samay diya jaae
 Nothing is better than loving yourself
 5
 Eat and cook the things you like, then if you are fond of eating, then if not right then you have a golden opportunity to taste new food and try cooking
 yaa phir aap apni pasand ke restraan yaa phir food chen main bhi jaakar khaanaa enjoy kar sakate hai
 6
 ek baar apane daily routine par najar jarur dalenjab aap kisi ke saath hote ho to kahin na kahin aapaki jindagi unke irdagird gumti rahati he
 Sometimes things like friends, choice and daily routine also change in this affair
 agar aisa he to sabase pehle workout se lekar doston ke saath ghoomane jane tak kii sari list taiyaar karen
 Prepare a seven-day routine every day, and in this list, definitely give space like healthy food, meditation and talking to the family
 padhein :brallep karnaa he to ranbir-anoushka se sikh len ye baaten
 
 
 7
 jab tak sab thik nahin hota single hi rahen
 
 
 As soon as you start recovering, things like your brain being cingled will be taken care of
 isliye jab tak aapako thik na lage partner dhundne main jaldbaaji na karen
 Be very happy and live your life in your own way so that there is no problem for you

 He said that we cannot accommodate all things in one rate
 jaruri khaadya padaarthon ko or paan,tambaakoo jaisi chizon ko ham ek saath ek hi tex slab main nahin rakh sakate
 There should be zero GST on food, because it is a critical requirement
 iske alaava rosemara kii jarurat ke saamaan ko 5 fisadi jiesti tex slab main hi rakhaa janaa chahie

 bataur athlete hamen shuru se hi khel main naitikta kaa paath padhaayaa jaataa he
 We play many vows to play sports spirit, unity, fairness and honesty
 khel or olympic ke prati pyaar or sammaan kii khatir ham in tamaam mulyon ko khud main samaa lete hai
 But is it not justified to raise the question that the moral values of those sitting in sports administration should also be high
 aaj desh bhar ke athlete yahi chaahate hai ki unke khel kii prashasnic kaman eemaandaar adhikariyon ke haathon main ho
 But the truth is that our number comes last in the list of current Indian Olympic Association (IOA)
 ye sangh keval apane swaarth ke liye kaam karata he
 After a successful Olympic campaign, in which we won six medals, the International Olympic Committee suspended the National Olympic Association
 2008 beijing or 2012 landan olympic main behtareen pradarshan ke baad hamaari nigahen 2016 or 2020 ke olympic par honi chahie thi
 a strong Olympic campaign was needed to inspire the youth
 lekin hamaare prashaasak is bahes main ulajh gaye ki daagiyon ko chunaav ladane se roka jaae yaa nahin?ek athlete ke taur par ham yah jarur chahenge ki agar prashaasak olympic andolan kii aguwai karen to unka ek ghoshnaptr avashya ho
 Our politicians can understand the term manifesto better
 aisi sthiti main desh main khel ko aage le jane ke liye unki yojanaayen kya hongi? athleates ke liye vah kya karenge? nae tenlent ko aage laane or puraane diggajon ke liye unke kya-kya plan honge?aaj olympic team ke paas koi permanent sponcer tak nahin he
 Corporate houses say that they are not ready to pay even one rupee for the Olympics due to lack of transparency and people with tainted image
 aap chaahe kisi bhi bhartiya athlete se puch len, wo aapako unke saath tour par jane vaale ayogy kochon kii gaathaayen sunaayenge
 You will know from them how people who do not know the title of the game have been in creamy seats for 20-30 years
 buree se buree jindagi bitaate khilaadiyon ke kisse bhi aap aae din sunate hi hai
 We need leaders we respect for the Olympic campaign, not because of political stature but because of what they can do for sports and athletes
 hamen aise log chahie jinase prerana mili or is tarah ke badtar halaat phir naa paidaa hon
 (the author is the only Indian shooter to win an individual gold medal
 ) They used to say don't throw it away
 ham paalenge
 The world understood that the Messiah came to help the people

 You will remember the story of that shelter home of Muzaffarpur in Bihar or that of the girl child, which has been recorded in the pages of history as the biggest rape case of Bihar
 ab usee rape cond kii kahani ko sibiai ne 73 pannon main kalamband kar adaalat ko saunp di he
 This charge sheet of the screams of 34 innocent girls, confined in 73 pages, will tell whether that was the naked and creepy truth of the girl child of Muzaffarpur in Bihar? The girls who did not know the words of those vulgar songs in Muzaffarpur's shelter home
 unhen un par nachaaya gaya
 Dirty films were shown
 nashe ke injection or dawaaen di gayi
 Dressed in open and ugly clothes
 mehphilon kaa saamaan banaaya gaya
 Was raped
 or wo ye sab sahati raheen
 Suffered because there was no other way
 karatin bhi to kya
 Wherever she goes kisase kahatee ki unke saath kya ho rahaa he
 He had no one
 isiilie to wo yahaan ain thim
 But here too
 
 
 mat puuchhie unke saath kya kya hua
 What did they suffer? is maamle main daakhil kii gai 73 pannon kii chargeshit ke har ek panne par mujffarpur balika grih kii un ladakiyon kii chikhen hai
 Scratched nails are scratched like his body
 sookhe hue aansu hai
 Stunned stone eyes
 sahami hui sisakiyaan hai
 There are dried crusts on the wounds
 bhukh he
 Is thirsty
 or barason kii chalni ruh he
 What a poor thing sehatin bhi thi
 Used to live here too
 jo haivaanon ke saamne khud ko saunp detii thim wo dard se roti thim
 And those who refused were suffering from hunger
 khaanaa nahin diya jaataa tha un bacchiyon ko, jo brijesh thakur or uske mehmaanon ke saamne ashleel gaanon par thirakane se
 And refused to serve herself in front of Thakur's deeds
 in mehmaanon main main netaa bhi the
 Officer too
 ohadedaar bhi or rasukhdaar bhi
 According to this charge sheet prepared by the CBI, 34 of the 42 girls living in the girl child house of Muzaffarpur in Bihar were raped
 balaatkaar kii shikaar ladakiyon kii umr 7 se 13 saal kii thi
 One was only 3 years old
 par brajesh thakur neuse bhi nahin bakhsha behayaayi ko bhi shame aa jaae

 There is mention of giving them injections and drugs, showing pornographic movies and then doing porn with them
 aaropon ke samarthan ke liye sibiai ne 102 gavaahon ke saboot bhi pesh kiye hai
 It tells how Brajesh Thakur, owner of Balika Griha, forced girls to wear open clothes, dance to Bhojpuri songs, get intoxicated and rape by guests
 or manaa karne par unhen bhookha rakhaa
 However, child rights activists say that the CBI has omitted in its charge sheet the names of government officials who knew about these excesses and harassment
 magar unhone naa to unhone hastkshep kiya or naa koi karrwai hi kii
 Among the 21 people who have been charged by the CBI, Brajesh Thakur, Indu Kumari, Meenu Devi, Manju Devi, Chanda Devi, Neha Kumari, Hema Christ, Kiran Kumari, Ravi Kumar Roshan, Vikas Kumar, Dilip Kumar Verma, Vijay Kumar Tiwari, Guddu Kumar Patel alias Guddu, Krishna Kumar Ram alias Krishna, Rosie Rani, Ramanuj Thakur alias Mamu, Ramashankar Singh alias Master Sahab alias Master ji, Dr

 Earlier, a source said on the condition of anonymity that 87-year-old Advani has not been sent a message to attend the program
 sthapana diwas ke kaarykram kii kaman bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke haath he
 Last Saturday, Advani refused to address the party, refusing Amit Shah's request at the party's national executive held in Bengaluru
 pichley 35 saal main party ke kisi bhi adhiveshan main adwani kaa sambodhan bijepi main ek rivaaj kii tarah ban gaya tha
 Advani had done everything possible to prevent Narendra Modi from becoming the Prime Ministerial candidate before the last general election, but he was evicted from a decisive role shortly afterwards
 adwani ke saath hi purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi or murali manohar joshi kii bhi nirnay lene vaale mandal se chuttee kar di gai thi
 All the leaders were later put in the 'guide board', which serves as a suggestion to the party, although opposition parties have maintained that senior leaders have been shifted to the retirement home by the BJP

 The Nobel Prize was awarded in 2007 due to climate change and global warming
 america ke jo vaais president albert gore junior the unhen nobel prise isliye diya gaya tha, kyonki unhone climet par kaam kiya tha
 Nitish Kumar did such work for the first time which no state of India did

 There is NDA government in the state, there is also NDA government in the country, now who will stop whom, give it to whom to give

 According to Brahma and Skanda Purana, Lord Vishnu was incarnated in Puri as Purushottam Neelmadhav

 Being the deity of the Sabar tribe, Lord Jagannath's form here is like tribal gods
 jagannatha mandir kii mahima desh main hi nahin vishwa main bhi prasiddh hai
 By the way, there are some miraculous things associated with this temple that surprise everyone - the flag on the summit of Jagannathamandir always wave in the opposite direction of the wind
 - isi tarah mandir ke shikhar par ek sudarshan chakra bhi he
 Looking at this chakra from any direction, it seems that the mouth of the chakra is on your side
 - mandir kii rasoi main prasad pakaane ke liye 7 bartan ek-duusare ke upar rakhe jate hai
 This Prasad is cooked on wood in pottery
 is dauraan sabase upar rakhe bartan kaa pakwaan pehle pakataa he phir neeche kii taraf se ek ke baad ekprasadpakata jaataa he
 You can not hear the sound of the waves coming from the sea only when you take the first step inside the temple's lion gate

 This experience feels even more unusual in the evening
 - hamane zyaadaatar mandiron ke shikhar par pakshi baithe or udate dekhe hai
 This thing of Jagannath temple will surprise you that no bird passes over it
 yahaan tak ki hawaii jahaaj bhi mandir ke upar se nahin nikalataa
 - The prasad made every day in the temple never diminishes for the devotees, as well as the prasad also ends as soon as the temple is closed
 - din ke kisi bhi samay jagannatha mandir ke mukhya shikhar kii parchaai nahin banati
 - a priest changes the flag on the 45-storey summit of the temple daily
 aisi manyata he ki agar ek din bhi jhanda nahin badla gaya to mandir 18 varshon ke liye band ho jayega
 - Normally, the air moving in the day moves from the sea to the earth and in the evening, from the earth to the sea

 — Chris Gayle (@henrygayle)november 27, 2014 The bjp's Mahakumbhko Congress, which was held in Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday, has been called a flop show
 congresspradesh adhyakshakmalanathane aarope lagaaya ki jis kaarykram ke liye karodon rupee kharch kar die gaye, vahaan bijepi bheed nahin juta pai
 Kamal Nath alleged that the money was spent from the state exchequer for the BJP worker Mahakumbh, but the people of the state did not get any benefit from it
 kamalnath ne tanj kasate hue kaha ki bijepi ne daawa kiya tha ki ye duniya kaa sabase bada kaaryakarta sammelan hoga or isamen 65 hajaar se zyada boothon se 10 lakh se zyada kaaryakarta shaamil honge
 But despite the arrival of PM Modi and Amit Shah, the figure of workers remained around one and a half to two lakhs, that is, half of the number of workers claimed by BJP did not reach the venue of Jamboree Maidan
 kamalnath ne tanj kasate hue kaha ki puraa kaaryakarta mahakumbh 'congress koso' sammelan ban kar rahaa gaya, jisamen piem modi, amit shah aurasiem shivarajane sirf congress ko kosne kaa hi kaam kiya
 At the same time, the BJP has retaliated on the allegations of Congress not gathering
 pradesh bijepi pravaktaa rajnish agarwal ne twit kar likhaa, 'khabaren aa rahi hai ki congress ke netaa apana hoshohavaas kho chuke hai
 Come in the condition of ill-fated-left speaking
 aapako dikhen to inhen thanda pani pilaaein
 Close your eyes and ask them to rest
 kahen tasalli rakhen, ab congress kaa hashr to aisa hona hi he
 There has been a conch shell
 'saath hi bijepi ne daawa kiya he ki kaaryakarta mahakumbh world book of ricard main darj ho gaya he
 After the Mahakumbh, the state BJP has said in its official statement that the world's largest activist Mahakumbh has been awarded the World Record of the World Largest Cadre Based Convention of any Political Party by the UK of the World Book of Records
 world book of ricard kaa praaanpatr siem shivaraj or bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh rakesh singh ne praapt kiya he
 According to the BJP, 15 teams of the World Book of Record UK surveyed different criteria and after that BJP Madhya Pradesh deserves this honor, according to the BJP, the number of systems which were tested on the parameters, mainly such a number of Mahakumbh Party workers present at the event smoothly, food arrangement, 45 LED screens, vehicle arrangement, 5 heliped, 1 lakh square feet er Or exhibition, 26 vehicle system hectares were 1580 toilets

 azaadi mubarak Agenda on the politics of Maharashtra in Aaj Tak, Goyal said - the public voted for the BJP
 Prakash Javadekar attended
 piyush goyal or prakaash jaavdekar ne satr main tamaam muddon par khulkar baat kii
 In this session important topics like economy of the country, economic slowdown, citizenship law, pollution, Delhi elections and Maharashtra's political situation were discussed
 charchaa ke dauraan maharashtra kii raajnneeti se jude ek sawaal par kendriya mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha ki aage gaye yaa peeche gaye yah samay tay karegaa
 But we see this scene when faithfully ends
 modi ke poster chipkaakar vot maange or baad main vahaan jaakar khadey ho gaye jiske khilaaf chunaav ladaa tha
 This is not an alliance
 yah to dharm nahin he
 What happened in Maharashtra is a lower level of politics
 ooncha str bijepi degi
 Piyush Goyal said - if fighting on all the seats, more than 200 seats would be ours
 Piyush Goyal said that this was a post-poll alliance, pre-poll alliance was ours
 agar dekhen to hamane jitne siton par chunaav ladaa usamen se kareeb 70 fisadi siton par jeet hasil kii
 The Shiv Sena also won 40-50 per cent of the battles it fought
 ensipi or congress to or kam jiti
 This means that the people of Maharashtra clearly voted for Modi ji, voted for BJP, voted for Fadnavis
 goyal ne aage kaha ki agar ham shaayad sab siton par ladate to 200 se zyada siten hamaari hotin lekin hamane yuti dharm sarvopari rakhaa
 We did not betray the Shiv Sena
 kaaman voter base bahut tha
 But the alliance formed in the greed of power did not make our government
 janata ne dekha he ki kaise teenon partiyon ne milakar sarkaar banaai he
 i think the three parties will have to compensate for this in the coming years
 ajit pavaar ke saath sarkaar par diya ye javabacharchaa ke dauraan ajit pavaar ke saath milakar sarkaar banane ko lekar puche gaye ek sawaal par prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha ki jab rajyapal santusht hote hai tabhi shapath dilaate hai
 It sometimes happens to love someone else and move away with someone else
 yah aniatik gathbandhan he
 Maharashtra saw this, now Maharashtra will see the emergence of BJP
 piyush goyal ne kaha ki hamen lagata tha ki ajit pavaar ensipi kii aawaaj hai
 Did not talk to Shiv Sena
 shivasena ne daaman chhod diya
 We welcomed
 uske baad wo waapas chale gaye to janata dekh rahi he
 The public will answer them
 tripura main bijepi ne jis tarah se fatah pai he, wo desh kii raajnneeti main pehle kabhi nahin dekha gaya
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has demolished the 25-year-old Left Front Fort in Tripura
 ye apane aap main jabardast rajnatik badlaav he
 The BJP considers its electoral victory even bigger because it not only demolished the fort of its staunch ideological opponent but also assimilated the Congress to zero
 tripura or nagaland main bijepi or unke sahyogiyon kii sarkaar bananaa tay he
 Union minister and senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak that the credit of victory goes first to the people of Tripura, Meghalaya and Nagaland
 unhone kaha kipradhanmantri modike netritv par logon ko bharosa he
 Amit Shah accepts every challenge and we will also win in Kerala
 ravishankar prasad ne kaha kilaftka jameen par koi vajood nahin kyonki vampanthi is desh kii mitti ko nahin samaj sake
 Leftists talk about human rights of terrorists
 kendriya mantri ne kaha ki vampanthi is desh kii sanskaar or samskruti se hameshaa kate rahe hai
 The leftists could never understand the soil and heritage of India
 tripura main jahaan paanch saal pehle bijepi zero thi, vahiin 25 saal main pehali barleft ko kinarelga diya
 On this Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the left is being taken to its right place
 gauratlab he ki tripura main bijepi ko ajey bahut milane ke baad sarkaar bananaa tay he, jabaki nagaland main bhaajapa gathbandhan kii sarkaar banane kii disha main agrasar he
 At the same time, in Meghalaya, the BJP is trying to form a government with non-congress parties
 shanivaar ko mili jeet ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi or party adhyakshmit shahne bijepi kaaryakartaaon se kaha ki ab unka lakshya karnataka, kerala, pashchim bengal or odisha main satta hasil karnaa hona chahie
 Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash has approached the court on Wednesday by filing a fresh petition in the High Court regarding the notice issued by the committee of Delhi Legislative Assembly
 vidhansabha kii prashn evam sandarbh samiti ne unhen mangalvaar ko nayaa notice jari kar 8 march ko apane saamne pesh hone kaa nirdesh diya he
 Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash has challenged the new notice in the High Court
 chif secretary anshu prakaash ne acting chif justise gita mittal or justise si hari shankar kii bench ke saamne kaha ki unhen 5 march ko hai court kii single bench ne 11 april tak cameti ke saamne peshi taalane kaa order diya hua he
 The bench transferred the petition before the single bench for hearing
 ab 8 march ko single bench ke samaksh maamle kii sunwaayee hogi
 Vivek Chib, counsel for Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash told the court that on his petition, a single bench has stayed the stay order
 samiti ke vakil ne 5 march ko court kii bhi aashwaasan diya tha ki chif secretary anshu prakaash se sambandhit maamle main koi kaarywahi nahin karenge
 But he issued a new notice on Tuesday, which is in contempt of court order
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke rup main narendra modi ke 12 saalon ke kaarykaal ke dauraan panchayat raaj darasal modi raaj ke saamne tehra rahaa
 Theoretically, this was the aspect that made the state's growth rate worse than Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and even Bihar
 haalanki gujarat duusare kai rajyon ke mukaable behatar sthiti main tha, lekin maanav vikaas suchakank main koi sudhaar nahin ho rahaa tha
 Gujarat never rose above 15th position among the 30 states and union territories of India in the list of Human Development Index
 panchayat raaj sansthaanon ke avamulyan kii sabase badi vajah yah rahi ki narendra modi sari satta khud tak kendrit rakhane vaale netaa ke taur par ubhare or unhone satta ko vikendrit nahin hone diya
 Although the three great panchayats of the Panchayati Raj - Gandhi, Balwant Rai Mehta and Ashok Mehta - were from Gujarat, Modi failed to do any concrete work on the strong foundation of these great heroes
 duusari ore kerala or karnataka hi nahin, balki maharashtra, haryana, rajasthan ke alaava tripura, sikkim or himachal pradesh ne bhi gujarat ko kaaphi antar se pachhad diya, or logon kii bhagidaari vaale loktantr kaa rasta apanaaya
 At that time Modi was busy in expanding his economic agenda, which included the development of the poor and the common man (I am not even surprised that he had consistently requested my visit to Gujarat as Union Minister of Panchayati Raj Rejected - He was afraid that the truth of his vision would be revealed to everyone
 
 
 ) However, without waiting for Modi to enlighten on this issue, the Congress government under the leadership of Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah took a major step to make Karnataka the top state in the country in terms of Panchayati Raj, and Kerala and Maharashtra To be left behind, who had overtaken them in the last about 15 years
 karnataka panchayat raaj act main sanshodhan ke liye purv vidhansabha adhyaksh keaar ramesh kumaar kii adhyakshata main bani cameti ne pichley saptaah rajya sarkaar ko apni report saunp di
 This report, titled 'gram Swaraj Ka Raasta in Karnataka', contains several important amendment proposals, which have been prepared based on the ground experiences of the last 20 years
 inhen aap beete 30 saalon kaa anubhav bhi kah sakate hai, kyonki darasal '80 ke dashak main hi tatkaaleen mukhyamantri ramakrishna hegade or unke avismaraneey panchayat raaj mantri abdul nazeer sahib ne is disha main ahm shuruyaat kii thi
 The amendment proposal includes transfer of all powers from panchayats to gram sabhas, giving them the right to monitor and control it
 prastaav main ward str par salaah-mashvire se lekar panchayat str par tak is vikendrikaran ko majboot karne kaa bhav shaamil he
 Meaning, a single proposal has found an effective solution to the biggest puzzle of Panchayati Raj - there is a need for effective coordination among the support staff, especially in large panchayats
 choti panchayaton main logon kii bhagidaari kahin zyada prabhavi dhang se sambhav he
 According to the new proposal, clearly defining the obligations and responsibilities of panchayats made them legally more empowered, and the authority to issue 'utility Certificates' was given to Gram Sabhas
 isse kisi bhi kontractor kaa bhugtan tab tak manjuur nahin kiya jayega, jab tak gram sabha ekamat hokar yah faisla na kar le ki kaam santoshjanak rahaa he
 The community will be satisfied with this, the scope of corruption and rigging will also be reduced drastically
 iske alaava prastaav main jila panchayat seva sthapit karne kii baat bhi kahi gai he
 It will be supervised by the Panchayat Services Authority to ensure adequate number of employees at bureaucratic, accounts and technical levels at every level of Panchayat
 ise panchayat samiti ke mukhiyaaon or anya panchon ke anubhav or prashikshan se bhi puraa kiya ja saktaa he
 If the Government of Karnataka accepts the proposal of the Institute of Public Accounts of India to train a Chartered Accountant for 10 panchayats at a nominal fee, then it will be possible to meet the demand for modern, computerized and online administration, thereby making local The accountability of the administration will increase and the problems of local people will also be solved quickly
 panchayat raaj main sarpanch raaj jaisi surat paidaa na ho, iske liye yah zaruri hoga ki panchayat kaa koi bhi kaam cameti ke tahat hoga or koi bhi faisla panchayat ke sabhi sadasyon kii maujuudagi main hoga
 In order to eliminate the emphasis of money and muscle power in Panchayati elections, the committee has recommended payment by the state for the election
 kisi tarah kii privet or party funding kii anumati bhi nahin hogi
 The State Election Commission will have the right to take all decisions related to elections, which will include decisions ranging from delimitation of panchayats to disqualifying candidates without political interference
 lekin is report kii sabase mahatvapurn anushansa panchayaton kii takat or adhikaar ke daayre se sambandhit he
 Referring to the reference to Article 243G of the Constitution, the report stresses the process of decentralization and its content, stating that the Panchayat is the institution of local swaraj
 is report kii sanlagnak suchi main vistrut activity map main un 29 vishyon ko soochibaddh kiya gaya he, jo gyarahavin anusuchee main darj hai, jinke mutabik teen epa - function (kaary), finance (vitt) or functionariz (kaaryakarini) main vikendrikaran kii vidhi kaa zikr he
 This will make it possible to empower panchayats effectively
 panchayatein aarthik vikaas or saamaajik nyaay kii apni yojana or kaaryakramon ko nayaa rup de paaengi, nigaraanee kar paaengi or lagu kar paaengi
 Apart from this, it is also proposed that the recommendations of the State Finance Commission should be accepted and implemented in the same manner as the recommendations of the Central Finance Commission
 in krantikari prastaavon ko lagu karne ke liye karnataka ko centre sarkaar se manjuuri lene kii jarurat nahin he
 They can decide all issues in Bengaluru only, with the support of the Legislative Assembly
 agar rajya sarkaar ne turant faisla kiya to april, 2015 main hone vaale panchayat chunaav main uski baari jeet sunishchit ho jaaegi
 Perhaps this will be a lesson for the anti-panchayat Modi government that they can fool all the people for some time or they can fool some people forever, but not all people can always be fooled
 pashchim bengal main chunaav ayog ne prachaar karne par raat ke 10 baje ke baad se roak laga di he
 
 yah chunaav ayog kaa ek aisa faisla he jisko lekar bahes chhid gai he
 
 kai log kah rahe hai ki yadi chunaav ayog ko prachaar band hi karnaa tha to 15 taarikh ke 10 baje se hi band kar dena chahie tha
 Why it was extended by 34 hours
 kya isliye ki bengal main pradhanmantri ko do raily honi thim
 The Election Commission has come under dispute over this decision and is being accused of bias
 yah pehla mauka nahin he jab chunaav ayog par is tarah se anguliyaan uthaai ja rahi hai
 Major intellectuals of the country have also raised questions about its functioning and the Supreme Court has also commented
 or yah sab ho rahaa pashchim bengal ko lekar kyonki yahaan bijepi or trinmul ke bich takaraar kaaphi bad gaya he
 The tension was already there, but Amit Shah's roadshow served to add fuel to the fire as news of violence came out of it and the situation became uncontrollable
 pashchim bengal main mamata banerjee or pradhanmantri ke bich rishta tanaav se bharaa rahaa he
 In 2014, Mamta called Modi ji a riot babu
 is baar pradhanmantri ne bengal ko tripal tii kaa naam diya yani trinmul, tolabaji, tex
 On this, Mamta Banerjee became furious
 mamata ne bhi is baar koi kasar nahin chodi
 He prohibited the meetings and road shows of Yogi, Smriti Irani and Amit Shah and ordered the chopper not to land
 takaraar badhati hi gai
 Actually the story of this quarrel begins in 2017 when the BJP began to formulate a strategy for Purba Dekho i
e
 the North East states including Assam, Tripura and North East states
 isamen odisha or bengal bhi shaamil tha
 The result of this was shown in the 2018 Panchayat elections
 bijepi ne pehali baar bengal main purulia kii 1944 gram panchayaton main se 644 jeetin
 Similarly, 329 seats were won out of 806 in Jhargram
 jhargram main trinmul ne 79 main 28 gram panchayat ganvaa deen
 Jhargram is the area that Mamata Banerjee first took away from the Left parties in 2011 and the rise of the Trinamool Congress began
 itihaas ab phir apane aapako doharaa rahaa tha
 This time more BJP was beginning to emerge in Jhargram
 panchayat chunaav main trinmul ne jahaan 21,110 panchayat jeetin to duusare number par bijepi rahi
 He captured 5,747 panchayats
 vahiin vamadalon kii jholii main 1,708 or congress ke paas 1,062 panchayatein
 
 vamadalon kaa safaya hona shuru ho gaya tha
 In 2011, where the Left parties had around 40 percent of the vote, it had come down to 25 percent in 2016
 yahi nahin trinmul congress ke cader se bachane ke liye vamadalon ke cader ab bijepi main shaamil hone lage the
 He also had a sense of revenge from the Trinamool
 wo mamata ko naapsand karte the
 The same thing is now coming to the fore
 yahi vajah he trinmul or bijepi ke kaaryakartaaon ke bich sangharsh kii
 Kolkata remains its focal point
 vajah he antim daur kii jin nau siton par chunaav ho rahaa he, ve sab isi ke aasapaas hai
 
 sab ek-duusare se judi hui hai
 Dum Dum, Barasat, Basirhat, Jayanagar, Mathurapur, Diamond Harbor, Jadavpur, Kolkata South, Kolkata North are scheduled to cast their votes on May 19 and the Trinamool Congress is currently holding all these nine seats
 jisamen 2014 main uttar kolkata or dakshin kolkata main bijepi duusare number par thi or is baar baaki saat siton par bijepi or trinmul congress ke bich kadaa muqabla he
 This is the reason why the Prime Minister says that this time the government will be formed from West Bengal
 bijepi ko lagata he ki uttar pradesh,rajasthan,gujarat,madhyapradesh or chhattisgarh kii siton kii bharpai pashchim bengal or odisha se hi hone vaali he
 Obviously when there is so much at stake, then anything can be done and anything can happen
 to yah he kahani pashchim bengal main trinmul congress or bijepi ke bich sangharsh kii

 modi sarkaar dwaara raajnneetik dalon ko milane vaale videshi chande kii jaanch rokane ke liye loksabhaa main laae gaye kanoon sanshodhan ke khilaaf ab left party ne morcha khol diya he
 CPM leader Prakash Karat told 'aaj Tak' that his party would oppose this law
 centre sarkaar ne loksabhaa main us kanoon main sanshodhan pesh kar shor- sharabe ke bich use paarit karvaa liya, jisase ab 1976 se lekar ab tak raajnneetik dalon ko milane vaale kisi bhivideshi chande kii jaanchanhin kii ja sakegi
 The legislation brought through the Finance Bill has got the approval of the Lok Sabha
 sabase hairaan karne vaali baat yah rahi ki itnaa mahatvapurn kanoon loksabhaa main bina kisi charchaa ke paarit kar diya gaya
 Prakash Karat said in a conversation with Aaj Tak that amidst the uproar in Parliament, it was passed and passed a finance bill
 unhone bataaya ki saal 2016 main bhi yahi kanoon laae the, lekin tab hoicourt necongress or bijepico videshi chanda lene ke maamle main doshi paaya gaya tha or usee se bachane ke liye ab modi sarkaar is bill ko dobaaraa 1976 se lagu karwaane ke liye lekar ai he
 Sitaram Yechury has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against this bill
 prakaash karaat kaa kahana he ki ham is kanoon kaa virodh karte hai
 Being a finance bill, this law cannot be stopped in Rajya Sabha
 prakaash karaat kaa kahana he ki ab koi bhi videshi company bharat main apni ek branch kholkar raajnneetik dalon ko chanda de sakati he jisaki jaanch nahin hogi sipiem is kanoon ke khilaaf he
 Apart from the court, the left parties will try to surround the BJP by raising this issue on the road too
 sansad main hangaame ke bich sarkaar ne vitt vidheyak 2018 main 21 sanshodhano ko manjuuri de di, unheen main se ek sanshodhan videshi chanda niyaman kanoon 2010 tha
 This law till now prohibited political parties of India from receiving donations from foreign companies
 sarkaar is bill ko finance bill ke rup main lekar ai jisase rajyasabha main bhi is kanoon ko ab nahin roka ja sakegaa or iske lagu hone ke baad bharat ke sabhi raajnneetik dal kisi bhi videshi company se chanda le sakenge or uski jaanch nahin kii ja sakegi
 CPM leader Prakash Karat alleges that the BJP has saved the Delhi High Court's order in 2014 against the donations of both BJP and Congress through this law
 saal 2014 main dilli hoicourt ne bijepi or congress ko videshi chandon ke maamle main epasiare ke maamle ke tahat doshi paaya tha or centre sarkaar ko in donon partiyon ke khilaaf karrwai karne ke aadesh bhi die the
 In order to avoid action, the Central Government had brought the Finance Bill 2016, in which the Foreign Fund Regulation Act i
e
 FCRA was amended
 ab is nae kanoon ke jariye 1976 se hi raajnneetik dalon ko milane vaale har chande kii jaanch kii sambhaavna ko khatm kar diya gaya he
 Left parties say that he will now fight against this law on the road
 vahiin supreme court main seetaram yechuri dwaara is bill ke khilaaf daakhil kii gai yachika lambit he
