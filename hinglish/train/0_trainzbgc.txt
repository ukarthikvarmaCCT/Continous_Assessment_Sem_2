 Leon took eight wickets for 50 runs, leaving the Indian team reduced to just 189 runs in the first innings on the very first day of the second Test against Australia, but Rahul persisted
 rahul ne match ke baad press conference main kaha, "ham jaanate hai ki aish (aswin) sheersh stareey gendbaaj hai or ek baar vah ek do wicket hasil kar legaa to lay main aa jayega, tab vah australian ballebaaji line ap ko tahas nahas kar degaa, hamen iskaa puraa bharosa he

 tippaniyan He said, "jadeja did not get to bowl that much today but like Leon he can bowl a lot of left-handed batsmen out of the off stump
" agar vah aisi gendbaaji karegaa to use kaaphi wicket bhi milenge
 "rahul said that cracks have started and it will be difficult to bat on this wicket
 unhone kaha ki wicket kaaphi kuch usee tarah kaa he jaisaa ki unhen ranjai trophy maichon main karnataka ke liye khilne ko miltaa tha lekin gharelu maichon ke dauraan daraaren itani jaldi nahin padati
 Rahul said, "I think it is the same kind of wicket as we get in Ranji Trophy

 But here the wicket was very dry and the cracks were very high
 " yah yuva khilaadi 100 ran banane se chook gaya
 He had some shoulder problems but said there was no point in taking a break for therapy
 unhone kaha, "us samay chikitsiya upachaar se mujhe zyada phayda nahin hota
 So i thought of continuing playing and tried to play some shots which were not beneficial for me
 " Rahul said in the post-match press conference, "we know that Ash (ashwin) is the top-level bowler and once he gets a couple of wickets, he will be in rhythm, then he will destroy the Australian batting line up
 , We are confident of this
 " rahul ne yah bhi kaha ki ravindra jadeja bhi upyogi sabit ho sakate hai, agar vah pich kaa istemaal utani hi prabhaavshaalee tareeke se karen jaisaa leone ne kiya

 If he bowls like this, he will also get a lot of wickets
 " rahul ne kaha ki daraaren shuru ho gai hai or is wicket par ballebaaji karnaa mushkil hi hoga

 rahul ne kaha, "mujhe lagata he ki yah usee tarah kaa wicket he jaisaa ki hamen ranjai trophy main miltaa he

 ) Kitab: Diyodhikar: Gulzar Prakasak: Vani Prakashankavar: Hardkavar Price: 250 rupees was going to be big, then if i ask the dimensions, how important it is to grow up!


 The famous poet, filmmaker, story writer as well as the best lyricist Gulzar saheb has written the book Doori
 dyodhi kai choti-choti kahaniyon kaa sangrah he, jisamen gulzaar sahab ke tajurbe or ahsaason kii khushboo aati he
 Gulzar saheb himself has written that stories have many stances
 aisi gol nahin hotin ki har taraf se ek si hi najar aaen
 The head is like a steep hill in front of which many people have climbed and passed by making footpaths
 dyodhi bhi aapako kai pagarhndiyon se lekar gujaregi
 The collection is dedicated by Gulzar to noted theater director Salim Arif
 saleem is sangrah kii kuch kahaniyaan jaise 'athnniyaan', 'jhadi' or 'baas' kaa kitaab ke prakaashan se pehle hi manchan kar chuke hai
 Diyodhi is divided into eight parts by Gulzar Saheb and each part begins with a lion, which does not allow the lack of a poet Gulzar to accompany the storyteller Gulzar
 shuruyaat gulzaar sahab ne dosti se kii he
 If you ever go through the books, you get characters like this, some friends are found standing in the antechamber of time! There are 'sahir and Jadoo' in this Deodhi, 'kuldeep Nayar and Pir Sahab' along with 'bhushan Banmali'
 geetkaar sahir ludhiaanvi or javed akhtar (jaadu) kii dosti main 100 rupee kaa zikr ise beshkeemtee bana detaa he
 100 rupees, Sahir's death and Javed Akhtar's bitter crying will make your eyes moist
 gulzaar sahab ne bharat-pakistan vibhaajan ko bahut kareeb se dekha he or isapar pehle bhi kaaphi kuch likh chuke hai, kyonki unka khud kaa bachapan bhi sarhad ke us paar chhot gaya tha
 In 'kuldeep Nayyar and Pir Sahab', Gulzar Saheb has told how even Pir Saheb could not escape from the divide
 gulzaar sahab or naiyar sahab bagha border kii taraf ja rahe hote hai to naiyar sahab unase kehete hai,'ye sadak agar isi tarah sidhi chalati rahe, naa koi vija puche, naa koi passport dekhe, or main pakistan gum kar aa jaaun, to kya lut luungaa us mulk kaa? luutane waalon kii to naa is mulak main kami he, naa us mulak main
 Why do they need to come from outside? ”no matter how many Indians and Pakistanis will be in the pain, but who cares about human sentiments if they get rid of politics? Read: Open letter to Gulzar
 
 
 agar aap mumbaikar hai to apane shahar ko or kareeb se jaanane ke liye dyodhi kaa doosraa hissaa jarur padhein or agar nahin hai to mumbai ko jaanane kaa isse acha mauka aapako nahin milegaa
 The second part begins with 'sir sir in water and at the feet this city is of Mumbai!'
 
 
 'kabhi naa sone vaali mumbai kii jhopad pattiyon or footpath par rahane waalon kii jindagi kii kahaniyaan padhakar aapkaa dil pasij jayega
 Gulzar saheb has also used the tone of Mumbai with the characters of Mumbai
 'baas', 'jhadi', 'sarathi' or 'footpath' sheershak hi apni kahani ke bare main kaaphi kuch kah jate hai
 The way the death of a man living on the sidewalk has been linked to the death of a dog, and then Hira will say, 'life on the sidewalk is like that!' ankhon ko vija nahin lagata, sapanom kii sarhad hoti nahimband ankhon se roj main sarhad paar chalaa jaataa hum!ab ye sher hi bayaan karata he ki sarhad ke donon taraf ke log kis tarah se apano se milane ke liye tadap kar rah jate hai
 Major Kulwant Singh of India posted on loc summons Fattu aunty from Pakistan to India but cannot even sit for a moment with his mother and aunt
 'over' main bujhaarat singh ke dard kaa andaja aap is pankti se hi laga sakate hai- 'apane bhi ek liter hota to jindagi main kya majaa hota
 Now, bidi cannot be fired over atomic bomb
 
 
 !''dumbe!!' main neuyork main rahane vaale ritred faujee captain shaheen kehete hai- 'faujee ko bhi pehle pahal dar jarur lagata he
 But after taking two or three shots, the fear-and-haras does not even care
 jab goli chalati he to kaartoos kii ek khushboo udati he
 He gets intoxicated while firing on the front
 thodi der goliyaan naa chalem to kabhi-kabhi nasha tuutane bhi lagata he
 It is not necessary to apply someone! If a man gets angry even after awe, there is no fear
 ' jo log vibhaajan ke dard se rubaru nahin hue hai wo in kahaniyon ke jariye us dard ko mahasoos kar sakate hai
 There are as many stories in the Deodhi
 koi bhi ek duusare se nahin miltaa par har jagah baat inasaani jajbaton kii hi hoti he
 There are stories on riots, Kashmiri situation, human bombs, Naxalite and earthquake in Deodhi too
 aakhri hisse kii shuruyaat hoti he is sher ke saath
 
 
 Nabhi's relationship cannot be cut with a flower leaf! Nabhi's relationship is seen in 'sanjh'
 lalaji ko laline kaa bina bataae bal kataane jaisi maamuli baat bhi unhen itnaa aghat pahunchaati he ki unke ant kaa sabab ban jaati he
 At the same time, in 'adjustment', Nana ji is so shocked by the death of Nani that he starts living a nanny's life, wearing a nanny's sari and a blouse, he finds his grandmother
 kyon padhein
 
 
 There are many reasons to read this book
 pehali ye ki ise gulzaar sahab ne likhaa he, duusari ye ki kahanikar gulzaar ke saath shaayar gulzaar bhi dyodhi main maujuud hai
 You can feel every relationship of a human being in the Diyodhi
 bachapan kii khushboo he to budhaape kaa dard or akelaapan bhi
 If there is pain, there is also mention of prayer
 dosti he to dangon ke dauraan kaise insaan hi insaan kaa sabase bada dushman ban jaataa he uskaa bhi byora he
 There are some things about the mood of the troops posted on the border, which you will be surprised to know about

 desh kii pehali bullate train ke project kaa shilanyas gujarat ke ahmedabad main guuruuvaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi or japan ke piem shinjo abe ne kiya
 With the cooperation of Japan, Modi is realizing the dream of bullet train
 ahmedabad-mumbai kii bich chalane vaali bullate train kii neenv rakhane ke baad modi ne kaha ki bharat ko bullate train muft main milegi
 He also explained the mathematics of how the bullet train is making India free in a way
 piem modi ne kaha ki hamen japan jaisaa aisa dost mila he, jo bullate train project ke liye madadgaar bana
 He said that when people go to banks to take loans, the bank tells them the rate of interest is 6 or 7 percent
 modi ne kaha ki jab aap kuch kharidne ke liye bazaar jate hai, to aise main ek-ek paise kaa hisaab lagaate he
 If one buys a bike, he travels around 10 banks, and if one bank reduces even half percent in the interest rate, then it is happy
 is baat ko gujarat ke log bakhubi samajhate hai
 Modi said that people do not get such banks, but we have got a country like Japan, which gives us a loan of 88 thousand crores and interest is just 0
 1 fisadi ke dar par de rahaa he
 PM Modi said that if there is a friend like Japan, then it is possible to realize any project
 kya koi aisa dost yaa bank mil saktaa he jo ye kahe ki muft main lone le lo
 Not only this, if someone says that take a loan without interest and repay not in ten or twenty, but in fifty years, then what will you believe? The loan given by Japan is not to be repaid immediately, but to start the process of giving back after 15 years
 modi ne kaha is tarah hamaare paas japan ke bullate train ke liye liya lone adaa karne ke liye lanbaa vakt he or bjaay dar bhi bahut maamuli he
 This is a free form in which our country will get a bullet train without any money
 bullate train pariyojna se desh kii puunji bachegi or videshi nivesh bhi badhegaa
 The mumbai-ahmedabad High Speed corridor will give a boost to the entire region and will also open up employment avenues
 modi ne kaha ki bharat ek badi aabaadi vaala desh he
 As many people as Japan has, so many people travel by train in India every week
 unhone kaha ki bullate train ke project ko ham kam samay main puraa karne kaa prayaas karenge
 We have scope, Japan has skill
 japan ke sahyog se skill deveopment se desh kii takat hajaaron guna badhegi
 India and Japan have decided to fulfill their determination
 bhale hi log garmi ke mausam ko pasand naa karte hon, lekin garmiyon kaa bhi apana hi ek majaa he
 The warmth of the weather, the clear sky, the sunlight on the face, all give a different feeling
 lekin yahi garm mausam aapke is ehsaas ko feekaa kar saktaa he
 It is the weather of Vogarmi, in which the chances of getting pimples etc
 also increase
 munhaase hone ke kai kaaran ho sakate hai
 Hereditary problems may be one of the reasons
 kabhi-kabhi hamaari twachaa par jami dhul, tel or bacteria aadi bhi munhaason kaa kaaran ban sakate hai
 Those who have oily skin and those who exercise more should take special care of their skin, because the amount of oil in the skin increases due to heat and humidity, as well as the possibility of acne and rashes
 jaisaa ki aksar kaha jaataa he ki 'ilaaj se behatar saavdhaanee he', lihaaza agar aapkaa munhaason se kabhi koi vaasta rahaa he, to phir aapako kuch tips apnaane chahie or munhaason ko dur rakhane ke kuch prakritik upayon par gaur karnaa bhi behatar vikalp ho saktaa he
 Focus on eating - you should avoid eating more glycemic foods, such as donuts, wheat bread, soda and cooked or fried potatoes
 mithe tathaa starch utpaadon ko apane aahaar se dur rakhkar aapmuhaason kii rokthaamkar sakate hai
 Also, by doing this, you will also be healthy for a long time
 tanaav or munhasemhaz shaareerik hi nahin, balki maansik tanaav bhi munhaason kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 So try to avoid stress as much as possible, whether it is workplace stress or stress arising from personal life problems
 munhaason se dur rahanaa he, to tanaav se bhi dur rahanaa hoga
 Use of the wrong beauty products and some acne cosmetics i
e
 cosmetics and cleansing products can also be a cause of acne
 isliye taileey tathaa aise utpaadon se bachein, jinsetvachaa ko nuksanho saktaa he
 Also avoid the ingredients that you are allergic to
 aise utpaada aapke twachaa chhidron main rukaawat paidaa karte hai tathaa use nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 As a result, pimples come out
 pasinaa jarur pochhenjab aap kadi dhoop main baahar nikalate hai to aapako pasinaa bahut aata he
 There are many types of toxins and many dirt in your sweat
 isliye is baat kaa dhyaan rakhen ki hameshaa aapke haath main paseene ko pochhne ke liye koi chota towel yaa rumal ho
 Sweat automatically cleanses your skin, but acne does not come out, so it is important to wipe sweat from time to time
 chehre ko saaf rakhensamay-samay par apane chehre ko kisi saumy clenzar se dhote rahen
 Water splashes on the face bring freshness to the skin and due to hydration, pimples and pimples are kept away
 apane bhojan main falon va sabziyon ko shaamil karenzyada se zyaada hari sabziyaan va fal khaaen
 This type of food not only takes care of your health, but is also a major source of antioxidants, vitamins and other essential nutrients, which help to remove acne scars and heal acne-prone skin
 zyada se zyada pani piengrmiyon main zyaada se zyaada pani pine kaa prayaas karen
 Water eliminates toxins and dirt generated in the body's system and your skin also remains soft
 sust va mand jivan style se bachein -apane sharir kohmeshaa active rakhane kaa prayaas karen
 Yoga and exercise increase skin tone and metabolism is also good
 aaramdaayak kapade hi pahanendile kapade pahanen taaki twachaa ko nuksaan naa pahunche
 Try to avoid the pressure from heat, friction and tight cap etc
 synthetic jogging suut yaa yoga outfit kii bajaae sooti ke kapade hi pahanen
 Keep the body clean after exercise, make sure to take a bath after exercise so that sweating gets cleared
 jab vyaayaam ke baad aapako pasinaa aata he to aapaki twachaa par mrit koshikaayen jamaa ho jaati hai
 Therefore, it is necessary to remove them as soon as possible
 agar ye mrit koshikaayen twachaa par rah jaae to munhaase hone kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 So to avoid this, take a bath or take a refreshing shower
 in nuskhon se aapako phayda to milegaa, lekin yah baat bhi dhyaan main rakhni hogi ki munhaase kai prakaar ke hote hai
 Also, it has to be kept in mind that acne occurs due to age and health reasons (diabetes etc
)
 isliye aapako zyaada sachet rahane kii aavashyaktaa he
 Homeopathy is the best treatment option for any type of acne

 Due to the retort from BSF on the border apane matadaataaon kii samasyaon ko apni hi party kii sarkaar tak pahunchane ke liye pradesh ke do bhaajapa vidhayakon ko sadak par utarana padaa he
 These are former minister and MLA Anup Mishra and MLA Deepak Joshi from Hatpipalya

 Health Minister Anoop Mishra is an MLA from here
 ve apane samarthakon ke saath 13 farvari ko nagar nigam ke daftar pahunch gaye
 He accused the corporation officials of not paying attention to the problems of the public and heard all the officers fiercely
 mishra ne kaha ki adhikari shahar ko sundar banane ke naam par tod-phod kar janata ko pareshaan karne ke tareeke dhundhate rahete hai
 After this, he also put Jan Chaupal in front of the Municipal Corporation headquarters and asked the citizens to report their problems and complaints
 bhaajapa shasit nigam ke khilaaf party ke hi vidhayak ke utar aane se khalabali much gai
 The situation became even more troublesome for the BJP when Brijendra Singh Jadaun, the corporation president along with 20 councilors of the party, also supported Mishra
 yahi nahin, unke samarthan main kai congressi netaa bhi utar aae
 Mishra alleged that the encroachments to widen the roads were removed a year ago but widening was not done yet
 maamle ko badhata dekh pradesh bhaajapa adhyaksh prabhaat jha ko maidan main aana padaa
 Jha went to his house to convince Mishra
 unhone maamle ko sambhalate hue or party main eka dikhaane kii koshish karte hue kaha ki mishra ne apane kshetra kii jan samasyaon ko uthaaya he isamen kuch bhi galat nahin he
 Mishra's attitude can also be considered as a way of making his presence felt at the state level
 darasal dedh saal pehle mishra ke parijanon kaa naam ek hatyakand main aayaa tha, jiske chalate unhen mantrimandal se istipha dena padaa tha
 However, the matter later cooled down and Mishra was hopeful of regaining the ministerial position, but this did not happen
 jan chaoupal ke bahaane jab mishra kaa sandesh sarkaar or sanghathan tak pahunch gaya to thodaa naram padate hue unhone kaha ki unka yah kadam sarkaar ke khilaaf nahin he balki nagar nigam ke adhikariyon ke ravaiye ke khilaaf he
 Mishra was cold in Gwalior when bjp's veteran leader Kailash Joshi's son and MLA Deepak Joshi also came out on the road to convey his voice to the government
 devas jile ke hatpiplya se vidhayak deepak ne apane kshetra se guzar rahe gitti bhare danparon ko bich raah main hi roak diya or aarope lagaaya ki vidhayak nidhi se jo sadak unhone banavaai thi vah ek company ke gitti se bhare in danparon ke kaaran tut rahi he
 Construction of 6-lane road is going on in this area
 sadak nirmaan kii vajah se yahaan danparon kii awajahi bahut bad gai he
 Joshi alleges that the dumpers carry goods in excess of the prescribed limit arbitrarily, causing damage to the roads
 in danparon ke kaaran log surakshit mahasoos nahin kar pate hai
 Joshi says, "despite repeated requests from the administration in this regard, there has been no attempt to find a solution till now
 isi vajah se sadak par aakar apana virodh jataana padaa he
 "joshi has warned that if his problem is not taken care of till February 18, then his next step will be to block the highway of the area
" joshi ke kade tewaron ko dekh nirmaan company ne bich kaa rasta nikaalane kii koshish kii he
 Gayatri Constructions has assured them that the company will fix whatever damage has been done to the road itself
 ummid kar sakate hai ki vidhayakon ke in tewaron se janata ko thodaa-bahut phayda to mil hi jayega

 Team India captain Cool Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Wednesday completely ruled out the possibility of landing with three spin bowlers in the first Test match against England starting on Thursday
 iskaa matlab he ki senior of spinner harbhajan singh ko antim ekadash se baahar rakhkar aar aswin or pragyan ojha ko antim ekadash main khilaayaa ja saktaa he
 Harbhajan has returned to the team after more than a year
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘agar hamen kanpur main 2008 main dakshin africa ke khilaaf jaisaa wicket mila tha, vaisaa miltaa he to ham chaar spinneron ke saath khel sakate the
 We also need to see that we are getting a wicket on which even the fast bowlers are getting a little reverse swing
 hameshaa yahi salaah di jaati he ki aisa gendbaaji akraman rakho jisamen vibhinnata ho
 Dhoni also informed that fast bowler Ishant Sharma will not play in the first Test as he has not yet recovered from viral fever while other fast bowlers Zaheer Khan and Umesh Yadav were available for the team, who did not practice with the team on Wednesday

 dhoni ne kaha, ‘ishanth ko viral he or vah puri tarah nahin ubra he
 Other players available
 ’ ashok dinda ko sharma kii jagah standby ke rup main bulaayaa gaya he, dhoni ne kaha ki team ne thodi atirikt satarkta barti he
 He said, 'he is just a' back-up '
 agar koi raat main yaa phir subah chotil ho jaataa he to vah team main aa saktaa he
 Talking about Zaheer and Yadav being absent in practice today, Dhoni said that it happened according to the team's plan as they want to give rest to these two fast bowlers after a long practice session in Mumbai and here in the last few days
 Were
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘yah hamaari yojana thi
 We had a long practice in Mumbai from November 9 to 11 and have practiced here in the last few days
 ye unke liye lambey satr the
 We said it would be good to give them rest
 ’unhone is vivaad main kuch bhi bolne se inkaar kar diya ki kya yah team ke liye badla chuktaa karne kii siries he kyonki bharat ko pichley saal england main 0
 Whitewash had to be seen from 4
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘main sirf itnaa jaanata hum ki ham maidan par jaayenge to vahaan ek laal gend hogi or do team khelengi
 You can name whomever you want
 ’unhone gautam gambhir or virendra sahvaag kii salaami jodi ko todane kii baat se bhi inkaar kar diya, jabaki dilli kii yah jodi newjiland ke khilaaf pichhali gharelu siries or australia main siries main acha pradarshan nahin kar saki thi
 Dhoni ended the round of speculation and said, "gautam and Veeru will start the innings
 ’ unhone do frontline spin gendbaaj aswin or ojha kii tarif karte hue kaha, ‘aswin or ojha ek duusare ko bakhubi samajhate hai, jo bahut mahatvapurn he
 Ojha controls the run pace at one end and Ashwin is always more aggressive with plenty of variation and likes to use them
 ’ harbhajan kii bhoomika ke bare main dhoni ne kaha ki punjab kaa yah of spinner kaaphi anbhavi he jinase ye donon yuva spinner phayda uthaa sakate hai
 The World Cup final match between Australia and New Zealand in Melbourne is nothing short of a religious crisis in front of New Zealand wicket-keeper batsman Luke Ronchi
 ek ore unki puraani team he australia or duusari unki nai team he newzealand
 Yes, Luke Ronchi is the only cricketer who has participated in international cricket from both Australia and New Zealand
 ronchi kaa janm newjiland ke denevirke main hua tha, lekin 6 saal kii umr main ve apane parivaar ke saath pashchimi australia chale aae
 He soon became recognized in domestic cricket
 unhen 'bhavishya kaa gilcrist' tak kaha jane laga
 Ranchi, who has been batting in wicketkeeping as well as stormy style, got a chance to make his ODI debut for Australia in 2008
 ronchi ne duusare hi vanade main mahaj 22 gend par hafacenchuri jamaa di
 But Ronchi later got only 4 odis and three T20 matches for Australia
 bread hadine kii maujuudagi se ronchi ko ehsaas ho gaya ki unhen ab australia kii ore se khilne kaa mauka shaayad hi mili
 He returned to New Zealand in 2012 and joined the New Zealand team in 2013
 janvari, 2015 main unhone srilanka ke khilaaf mahaj 99 gend par 170 ranon kii tufaani pari kheli
 In this same World Cup semi-final, his fellow player Grant Elliot has shown the feat of ousting his native country South Africa, in such a situation that there will be a religion crisis in front of Luke Ronchi
 lekin luk ronchi kii maa meggi ronchi ne final muqaabale se pehle kaha ki unka betaa ek kiwi he

 unhone yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki video main unki aawaaj ke saath chhedchhad kii gai he
 AFWA cannot claim at its own level that this video is going viral
 hamen koi aisa bhi saboot nahin mila jisase ye pataa chal sake ki video ke saath chhedchhad kii gai he yaa isamen alag se koi aawaaj daali gai he

 In the video, he can be heard making fun of the abbreviations of Delhi Police (DP), Punjab Police (PP)
 viral video se yah pataa lagaana mushkil he ki doosraa aadmi tej bahadur hi he
 The man who is being described as Tej Bahadur can be heard stopping the other man "at ease

 Yadav said, "these people secretly recorded this video and tried to blackmail me
 ”tej bahadur yadav ne is par kuch bhi kehane se inkaar kiya ki ve modi ko maarna chaahate hai
 According to him, this was a ploy to trap him and his voice has been tampered with
 yadav us samay charchaa main aae the jab unhone internet par ek video post karte hue shikaayat kii thi ki javaanon ko “kharaab” khaanaa diya jaataa he
 a court inquiry was held against him and in 2017 he was dismissed for allegedly tarnishing the "BSF image"

 There is no mention of election in the entire conversation of this entire video

 However, at our level we could not confirm when the video is from
 lekin in donon clip kii video yaa audio main koi chhedchhad nahin kii gai he
 During salaamcricket's 'winning the World Cup: Start of a Revolution', 1983 World Cup winning team captain Kapil Dev said that 2015 World Cup will be won by those who will play good cricket for 20 days
 kapil ne kaha, ‘hamane world cap se pehle westeindies ko westeindies main haraaya
 After winning the first match, we got the strength that we can beat any team in the world
 agar aap acha cricket khelenge to duniya kii kisi bhi team ko haraa sakate hai
 We were not known as a good ODI team
 shuruaati kuch match jeetne ke baad hamane jeet ke bare main sochna shuru kiya
 a 1983 or 2011 victory was a miracle in itself
 jab aap yah sochna shuru kar dete hai ki aap jeet sakate hai tab nateeja bhi uske anuroop aata he
 In the salaamcricket Conclave, Yuvraj, Harbhajan and Piyush opened the secrets of the dressing room
 isi seshan main maujuud 2007 world cap vijeta team ke australian captain riki ponting ne kaha, ‘2007 main hamaari team bahut majboot thi
 i also got many defeats as a captain
 lekin baad main safalataa mili
 Our players played well throughout the tour
 semifinal main jeet ke baad ham final main bharat ke saamne the or ham bahut acha khele
 inzamam-ul-haq, former Pakistan captain present in this session, was asked, "you were young in the 1992 World Cup, you hit a four in a match and then you were out
" imran ne aapse kaha, ‘bhai inji tune shot bahut acha khelaa
 Inzamam said, 'the captain's confidence in you is a big deal
 imran kii seat mere bagal main thi or unhone mujhase kaha ki tune chaukaa bahut acha maaraa
 World Cup winning captains are different
 ’ yah puche jane par ki tab imran sanyas lene ke baad vaapasi karne ke liye aae the, kaise hua ye sab? injamaam ne kaha, ‘unako yakeen tha ki main acha karuunga to team bhi acha karegi
 This belief of theirs managed to win the team
 ’kapil se yah poocha gaya ki 1983 main bhartiya dressing room main semifinal main jeet ke baad kya halchal thi, to kapil ne kaha, ‘ham keval 14 log the, vahaan junior se junior khilaadi bhi apni baaten kar saktaa tha
 It was only after the second-third match that we started thinking that we could win this tournament
 ’do world cap jeet chuke westeindies ke captain clive loyad se jab yah poocha gaya ki kya aap 1983 world cap ke final main team india ko syriasli le rahe the? loyad ne kaha, ‘westeindies team ke liye captaini karnaa bahut kathin he
 It is not a country but a group of 20 islands
 ham final se pehle bhartiya team ko chunauti nahin maan rahe the
 When the target of 183 runs was met, it was felt that we would make it
 lekin ant main behatar team jiti
 This was a good result for Indian cricket
 final se pehle ham keval yah soch rahe the ki hamen acha khelnaa he
 During this time, asking Ricky Ponting that you were on the verge of defeat in 1999? He said, 'we lost to New Zealand in the first match of the tournament followed by South Africa
 lekin ham semifinal main pahunche
 Most of our players did not even know after the tie that we had reached the final
 'dressing room main aapkaa role model koun tha?pontinga mark tailor, mark wa, steve wa, glen maikgra sabhi team main the, main kone main khadaa hokar inaki baaten sunata tha
 It was a great experience for the Australian team
 aapane pichley 15 saalon main bhartiya cricket ko badhate dekha he, aapkaa kaisaa anubhav rahaa he?pontinga ham achche pratidwandvi hai
 i like to play against the Indian team
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki bhartiya cricket se judane par paison kii bhi barsaat hoti he lekin saath hi yah bahut acha anubhav hi rahata he
 Many young Indian players are much better right now
 kya ab pakistan main kya ho gaya ki vahaan kaa cricket utana acha nahin rahaa?injamaamah player achche hai lekin vahaan kaa board sthir nahin he, aap kisi policy ko apana nahin pate
 Coaches are changing very frequently
 isaki vajah se khilaadi bhi sthir nahin ho paa rahe
 Missbah, Hafeez is playing well
 chairman shehryaar sahab ke netritv main pakistan cricket sthirataa kii ore badhegaa aisa meraa maananaa he
 Pakistan has not won from India in the World Cup and this time the first match is between India and Pakistan? Inzamam: india-pakistan match is very important for both countries
 pakistan world cap jeet gaya tha jab ham 1992 world cap main bharat se haara tha
 But it will not always be that we will keep losing to India in the World Cup
 kapilacricket bahut kheli ja rahi he
 What will be the team? Mindset should be very strong
 aapkaa focus niyantrit hona chahie
 Team India has no shortage of capacity
 1992 main ham tri siries khele, test siries khele uske baad world cap, is baar bhi kuch aisa hi ho rahaa he? mindset sabase mahatvapurn he
 Today is the technology which was not there in our time
 aaj world cap bahut bada he or jo un 20 dinon main acha khel legaa wo hi jitegaa
 Big names are not needed but commitment
 team india ke saamne sabase badi chunauti he ki khilaadiyon kaa form barkaraar rahe kyonki world cap se pehle unhen tri siries khelnaa he or test bhi
 We had the same thing with the 2007 World Cup
 dhoni ek captain ke rup main bahut sakasham hai
 They are capable of doing this
 kya dhoni vartmaan main vanade ke do behatar captainon main se ek hai?injamaamah dhoni apane fielderon kii placement behatar karte hai
 Dhoni, who has played the World Cup earlier, will get the benefit of his experience
 1983 world cap kii jeet bharat ke liye kaise acha rahaa?kapilh sirf bhartiya team ke liye hi nahin balki kisi bhi team ke liye world cap jeetna or hameshaa ek nai team kaa jeetna cricket ke liye acha he
 It was good for the Indian subcontinent that after us Pakistan and Sri Lanka won the World Cup
 1992 main lambey tour ke baad team kii captaini or world cap khelnaa kaisaa anubhav tha?mohammad ajaharuddinh hamaari team bahut acchhee thi, world cap ke dauraan ek do acchhee vyaktigat paariyaan kheli gayi lekin yah toornament jeetne ke liye kaaphi nahin tha
 Who was the best player for Team India in 1983
 Kapil: You cannot win the World Cup by believing in any one player
 team ke prayek khilaadi ko jeetne ke liye khelnaa chahie
 You can win a match because of a player but not a tournament, not a World Cup at all
 kya misabah kii captaini main maujuuda pakistani team world cap jeet sakati he?injamaamah board ko jise bhi captain bananaa he use kam se kam world cap se pehle ek saal dena chahie
 It is two or three months for the World Cup, it is not right to change the captain of the team
 aise main mujhe lagata he ki misabah ko hi captain banaae rakhana chahie

 The film was India's official Oscar entry that year
 3 ghante 42 minute kii is movie ne america, canada, syria, dakshin korea, norge, afghanistan, swizraland ke film festivels kaa hissaa hote hue pratishthit auskar puraskaar tak kaa safar tay kiya
 Lagaan is regarded as one of the most iconic films of Bollywood due to its narrative, amazing cinematography and shoots on real life location
 is film ke saath hi aamir khan ne bataur produsar apane kariyar kii shuruyaat bhi kii thi
 18 years after the release of this film, Ashutosh Gowariker is bringing the film Panipat with Sanjay Dutt and Arjun Kapoor
 arjuna se aage nikal chuke hai ranvirye film arjuna kapur ke kariyar ke liye behad mahatvapurn maani ja rahi he kyonki ve pichley kuch samay se ek bhi hit film nahin de paae hai or apni acting ko lekar kaaphi aalochana jhel rahe hai
 At the same time, his contemporary actor and friend Ranveer Singh is continuously performing with great performance and has surpassed him
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki ashutosh arjuna ke kariyar ko ek nai jaan de sakate hai
 Significantly, Arjunke Alavasanjay Dutt is also struggling with the famine of the hit film
 unki pichhali film sahib bibi or gangster 3 or kalank box offis par flop sabit hui thi
 At the same time, Sanju managed to earn more than 300 crores by playing a role in his biopic
 haalanki ye bhi sach he ki sanjay dutt ek bade superstar hai or arjuna kapur kii unase tulana nahin kii ja sakati he
 It is also true that Arjun Kapoor has a lot at stake with this Ashutosh Gowariker's film
 dekhnaa ye hoga ki is period film ke saath arjuna kapur kya kamaal dikhaa pate hai

 sabase taaja misaal he grih sachiv elsi goyal kii
 Officials say that Rajnath Singh was not even asked in the way Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the decision and brought a secretary from the Finance Ministry to the Home Secretary
 ab rajnath singh khafa bataae ja rahe hai
 The Home Minister was absent from his office when the new Home Secretary Rajiv Maharishi came and took charge
 vaise jab bhi koi badi ghatana yaa faisla liya jaataa he us vaqt grahamantri nadaarad paae jate hai
 Now take the conversation between India and Pakistan between the National Security Advisor, the entire responsibility was taken up by the NSA, whatever dossiers were being prepared, of course it included the Ministry of Home Affairs and IB officials, but It was only about Doval
 baatcheet hogi yaa nahin hogi ye tay nahin hua tha, lekin grahamantri apane ilaake ke daure ke liye chale gaye the
 When the talks were canceled, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj came and handled the matter
 is puure vivaad main grahamantri kahin na dikhe, na sunai pade jabaki baatcheet se judaa har kaam grih mantralay ne kiya tha
 Whether it was a terror issue, Dawood Ibrahim or border firing, the entire ministry was side-lined
 jab naga ecord hua, tab bhi grih mantralay ko piemo ne puure maamle se dur rakhaa jabaki grih mantralay main ek north east desk he
 The Minister of State for Home Affairs himself dismissed his press conference the day the Accord was signed because he knew people would only ask about the Accord and no one knew anything about the Accord
 grih mantralay ke galiyare vaise bhi is baat se garm hai ki zyaadaatar afasaron kii niyuktiyaan piemo karata he sirf order kii copy grih mantralay ko bhej di jaati he
 By the way, the debate is also becoming common in the officers that the Home Minister is not paying much attention to the work, he is only doing the Khanapurti, his entire focus is on the party
 tippaniyan Every small and big decision was made either from this ministry or somewhere, the role of the ministry was in those decisions
 ab donon nahin he
 One dispute after another is being connected with the Ministry of Home Affairs and it is being alleged that the Home Minister of India is not able to resolve any of these disputes nor is the Ministry running properly

 Whether or not the talks would take place was not decided, but the Home Minister left for a tour of his area

 The Home Minister was nowhere to be seen or heard in this entire controversy, while the Ministry of Home Affairs did everything related to the conversation
 chaahe vah aatank se judaa masalaa ho, daaud ibrahim se judaa yaa phir border firing se, lekin puure maamle main grahamantralay ko said line kiya gaya

 jab baatcheet cancil hui tab videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne aakar baat sanbhali
 The Home Minister was nowhere to be seen or heard in this entire controversy, while the Ministry of Home Affairs did everything related to the conversation
 chaahe vah aatank se judaa masalaa ho, daaud ibrahim se judaa yaa phir border firing se, lekin puure maamle main grahamantralay ko said line kiya gaya
 Even when the Naga Accord was held, the Ministry of Home Affairs kept the PMO away from the entire matter while the Home Ministry has a North East Desk
 khud grih rajyamantri ne jis din ecord par dastakhat hue us din apni press conference kaarij kar di kyonki unhen maaloom tha log sirf ecord ke bare main puuchhenge or ecord ke bare main kisi ko kuch pataa nahin tha
 The corridors of the Home Ministry are hot anyway because the PMO appoints most of the officers, only the copy of the order is sent to the Home Ministry
 vaise is baat par bhi bahes afasaron main aam hoti ja rahi he ki grahamantri kaam kaaj main zyada dhyaan nahin de rahe hai sirf khanaapurti kar rahe hai unka sara dhyaan party main laga rahata he
 The comments kabhi har chote bade faisle is mantralay se yaa to hote the yaa kahin na kahin un faislon main mantralay kaa role hota tha
 Now both are not

 On the other hand, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley have made their position in the party such that when there is a problem, they are led by the government, while the leader of government number two is always missing in times of trouble
 jab naga ecord hua, tab bhi grih mantralay ko piemo ne puure maamle se dur rakhaa jabaki grih mantralay main ek north east desk he
 The Minister of State for Home Affairs himself dismissed his press conference the day the Accord was signed because he knew people would only ask about the Accord and no one knew anything about the Accord
 grih mantralay ke galiyare vaise bhi is baat se garm hai ki zyaadaatar afasaron kii niyuktiyaan piemo karata he sirf order kii copy grih mantralay ko bhej di jaati he
 By the way, the debate is also becoming common in the officers that the Home Minister is not paying much attention to the work, he is only doing the Khanapurti, his entire focus is on the party
 tippaniyan Every small and big decision was made either from this ministry or somewhere, the role of the ministry was in those decisions
 ab donon nahin he
 One dispute after another is being connected with the Ministry of Home Affairs and it is being alleged that the Home Minister of India is not able to resolve any of these disputes nor is the Ministry running properly
 udhar, videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne or vittamantri arun jetali ne apni pojishan party main aisi kar lee he ki jab koi samasya hoti he to unhen sarkaar aage karti he jabaki sarkaar ke number do ke netaa hameshaa musiibat ke samay gaayab rahete hai

 varsh 2014 main pradhanmantri banane ke baad se ab tak narendra modi ne jo bhi bhaashan die hai, unamem se kisi kii bhi is tarah chautarafa saraahna nahin hui, jitani us bhaashan kii hui, jo unhone shanivaar ko sansad ke central haul main bjp-nit NDA ke navnirvaachit saansadon ke samaksh diya tha
 This speech indicated that he wanted to change the reality, spirit and image of his second term as Prime Minister
 prachaarak modi or captain modi ke bich kaa fark prashasankon ko bhi dikhaa, aalochakon ko bhi
 After all, he has reached here by leading the most polarized campaign in the history of parliamentary elections
 lekin ab nayaa behatar janadesh hasil karne ke baad aagaamee guuruuvaar ko ek baar phir bharat ke pradhanmantri ke rup main shapath grahan karne ja rahe modi ne katai nai or aisi style apanaai, jo saaf-saaf dhruvikaran ke ulat thi
 His speech was truly praiseworthy in many aspects - and most of all because of his effort to reach out to Indian Muslims
 unhone is mudde par kya kaha - or usase bhi zyaada ahm - unke kaary unki baton se mail khaaenge yaa nahin, inhen se tay hoga ki itihaas modi kii viraasat ko kis nazar se dekhegaa
 In his message to the Muslims, two things were worth keeping
 pehle, unhone muslimon kaa vishwaas jeetne kii zarurat par jor diya
 He said, "minorities have been deceived in this country through imaginary fears aimed at votebank politics
 
 
 hamen is chal kaa viched karnaa he
 
 
 We have to win trust
 
 
 " duusare, unhone apni hi vaicharik birdari ke bheetar gaharaai tak maujuud soch tathaa purvaagrah ko bhi chhedne kii baat kii - kaha jaataa he, muslim 'ham' nahin hai, 'duusare' hai
 He said, "we cannot have an alien now
 
 
 jo hamen vot dete hai, ve bhi hamaare hai
 
 
 Those who strongly oppose us also belong to us
 
 
 "modi ne muslimon kii taraf yah nai or charitra se mail nahin khaane vaali pahunch kyon banaai he
 
 
 The And why right now
 
 
 ? duusare sawaal kaa jawaab aasaani se diya ja saktaa he
 Now that he has got a bigger and more effective mandate than before, which was almost entirely for Modi and not for BJP, he is more confident that he will be able to take the party and government in that direction
 , Where he would like
 vah is sandarbh main sangh parivaar ke sakhti se bhi bandhaa hua mahasoos nahin kar rahe hai
 Now the Sangh Parivar has to accept his direction, not the Sangh Parivar
 yahaan yah baat yaad rakhane laayak he ki gujarat ke teen kaarykaal tak mukhyamantri rahane ke dauraan bhi unhone rajya main maujuud behad shaktishaalee vishwa hindu parishad tathaa RSS ke anya sanghathanon par puri tarah kaabo paa liya tha
 Now to know the answer to the first question, we have to look at the constraints and opportunities present in front of foreign policy and domestic policies in front of Modi
 gharelu baadhyataa to yah he ki unase votaron kii ummiden aasmaan chhu rahi hai, so, unhen ummiido par khara utarana hoga - khaastaur se aarthik morche par
 The condition of the economy is not good
 rojgaar kii maang bahut zyaada he, or chautarafa he
 The problems in the agricultural sector remain as they are
 or bhale hi mahangaai is chunaav main mudda nahin bani, lekin tel kii keemton main oochaal kii ashanka (america or iran ke bich bad rahe tanaav kii vajah se) se aam aadmi kii dikkatein badhengi hi
 In such a situation, Modi understands the need for peace on the domestic front, which can end the radicalism among his own supporters, and will make the Muslims feel insecure
 unke shabd - ab hamaara koi paraayaa nahin ho saktaa he - saaf-saaf unheen logon ke liye kahe gaye the
 Modi has created another compulsion for himself by adding 'sabka Saath' to his slogan 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'
 yah baat to din kii tarah saaf he ki na hi modi ab tak lagbhag 20 karod bhartiya musalamaanon kaa vishwaas jeet paae hai, na unki party aisa kar pai he
 His new slogan of 'inclusive development' for 'inclusive India' would remain hollow if the country's second largest religious community felt disenfranchised by the ruling party
 23 may ko BJP mukhyalay main die gaye vijay bhaashan main modi ne sahi hi kaha tha ki bhale hi chunaav 'bahumat' ke siddhant par jite jate hon, lekin sarkaar tabhi chalaai ja sakati he, desh tabhi aage bad saktaa he, jab 'sarvamat' ke siddhant kaa paalan kiya jaae
 But will it not remain a 'jumla' talk of 'universalism', if the voice of Muslims is not heard, and if Muslims are not given proper representation in institutions of power
 
 
 ? is mudde par modi pehle se tikhe sawaalon kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 Why 303 BJP mps in the new Lok Sabha do not have a single Muslim
 
 
 ? yahi haal rahaa, to BJP ko vaastavik rashtriya party kaise kaha ja saktaa he
 
 
 The Yes, the party has become geographically accessible across India, but is its social reach national
 
 
 ?videsh niti kii drushti se dekhen, to bhi modi ko bhartiya muslimon ko saath lekar chalanaa hoga
 His efforts have also strengthened India's relations with some important Muslim countries - especially Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) - in recent years, and because of the changing world
 pulavama main CRPF javaanon par hue aatankwaadi hamale ke baad in donon deshon ne bharat or pakistan ke bich tanaav ko kam karne main ahm bhoomika adaa kii thi
 The UAE had announced Modi to be given the highest civilian honor after the election process began in India
 muslim mulkon ke saath bharat ke kareebi hote rishton kii chamak dhundhlee ho jaaegi, agar bharat ke bheetar maujuud sampradayik bantwaare hinsak swaroop main saamne aate rahe
 It is also almost certain that Modi will now start talks with Imran Khan on many issues to normalize relations between India and Pakistan
 maine suna he ki unhone islamabad main sainya thikaanon se sanchaar kii linon ko bhi shuru kar diya he
 i sincerely hope that the new mandate will not be missed by this opportunity, and will use it to achieve what has undoubtedly been the most important challenge to India's foreign policy
 baharhaal, is mushkil kaam ko anjaam dene ke liye modi ko pehle yah dikhaanaa hoga ki unhone na sirf hinduon kaa 'vishwaas' hasil kar liya he, balki bharat ke muslimon kaa 'vishwaas' bhi unhen hasil he
 Yes, Modi's access to Muslims should be welcomed by all, as it can strengthen India's democracy, development and national integrity
 haalanki vah or unki party galati karenge, agar ve maan lenge ki muslimon kaa bharosa sirf baton se - yaa sirf muslimon main dar paidaa karne ke liye dharmanirpeksh partiyon ko kosne se jeeta ja saktaa he
 True, the anti-bjp parties are to some extent guilty of this, and they have used the 'muslim vote bank' for electoral gains, but did Modi and the BJP also keep away from the all-round fear among the Muslims, the power within them The feeling of being gone, the feeling of being perceived outside and even suppressed anger have not contributed to the increase
 
 
 ?isiilie, agar modi apni nai pari kii shuruyaat sachmuch sabko saath jodakar karne ke prati gambhir hai, to unhone bahut-se muddon par aatmamanthan karnaa hoga
 They will also have to force the BJP and the Sangh Parivar to follow their lines
 unhen khud aage badhkar muslim samudaay ke prabhavi or sammanit pratinidhiyon ko niyamit vaartaon ke liye aamantrit karnaa hoga, jinamein unke kade aalochak bhi shaamil hon, or bharat ke loktantric dhaanche main takat ke vibhinn staron par unhen bhi hissedari deni hogi
 Instead of blaming the Congress and other parties for not just blaming the Congress and other parties for the lack of participation of Muslims in education, employment and equal opportunities in the civil services and military services, the concrete policy and such Steps have to be taken to show that they can prove that they are committed to the progress of Muslims
 is sandarbh main, main suzav dena chahta hum ki vah isi vishay par ek shandaar nai kitaab - dinayal and depreveshan : indian muslims after da sachhar cameti and ranganath mishra kamishan reports - padhein, jise maine haal hi main mumbai main jari kiya tha, or yah kitaab maharashtra main sevarat IPS adhikari abdur rahamaan ne likhi he
 In conclusion, i would like to say, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, i wholeheartedly appreciate your speech giving hope in the NDA meeting
 ab karodon deshbhakt bharatiyon (gaiyr-muslim bhi, muslim bhi) ke saath mujhe aagrah karne den - jo aapane kaha, usee par chalem

 iske baad panel main aalia or bhoomi ko shaamil kiya gaya

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne swatantraaa diwas par sena ko lekar bada elaan kiya
 He called for the creation of a new post of Chief of Defense Staff for coordination and effective leadership among the three armies
 piem modi ne kaha ki hamaare desh main sainya vyavastha, sainya shakti or sainya sansaadhan main sudhaar par lambey arase se charchaa chal rahi he
 Reports of several commissions say that there is coordination between our three armies, water, land and sky, but as the world is changing today, thinking of India in pieces will not do
 piem modi ne kaha ki hamaari puri sainya shakti ko ekamusth, ek saath aage badhane par kaam karnaa hoga
 Now we will arrange the Chief of Defense Staff i
e
 CDS
 yun to desh main 1999 ke kargil yuddh ke baad chif of dephence kii maang uthi magar bhartiya sena ke ritred brigadier or raksha visheshgy gurmeet kanwal is mudde ko 1996 se hi uthaate rahe hai
 In an article he wrote for the Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis (IDSA) in 2013, he gave several arguments behind the need for this position
 12 disambar 2013 ko likhe apane lekh mengurmeet kanvalkahate hai ki aadhunik daur ke yuddh main safalataa sanyukt sainya niti or use ekikrut rup se dharaatal par utaarne par tiki hoti he
 Appointment of the Chief of Defense Staff will help in taking decisive decisions in crisis situations like war, analyzing all types of situations with the advantages and disadvantages of advancing each option
 chif of dephence matbhedon ko sulajhaa saktaa he
 CDS should be an overall Commander in Chief, ideally
 bharat ke vistrut bhubhag, lambii simaaon or tatarekhaon ko dekhte hue bahari or aantarik suraksha chunautiyon ke prabandhan ke liye sidies bahut jaruri he
 Why the COAC is not successful COG systematised Brigadier Gurmeet Kanwal gave the example of former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's famous statement - Committees cannot fight wars (committees cannot fight wars)
 winston churchill hi vah shaks the, jinhone duusare vishwayuddh main britain kii nishchit haar ko bhi apane twarit nirnyon se jeet main badal diya tha
 According to Gurmeet Kanwal, the use of Chief of Staff Committee (COAC) in the country has not been successful
 kyonki yah akjicutive athurity nahin he
 It is also not in a position to take harsh decisions regarding the three armies
 yah mukhya rup se sarvasammati se kaam karti he
 Since the end goals are the same for everyone, there is always a disagreement over choosing a route to get there
 aise main yuddh ke dauraan jatil sainya abhiyaanon, dwipaksheeya drushtikon ke dauraan peshewar samaj kii jarurat hoti he
 According to Brigadier Gurmeet Kanwal, often the fate of the entire campaign during a war depends on a single decision
 yah nirnay vishesh rup se chaynit raksha pramukh dwaara hi kiya ja saktaa he na ki sioessi jaisi samiti dwaara
 History is replete with examples when a decision changed the course of war
 duniya ke kai pramukh deshon ne is system ko apanaaya he
 India cannot ignore this
 ab is vyavastha ko apnaane kaa samay aa gaya he
 Brigadier Gurmeet Kanwal tweeted after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the appointment of Chief of Defense Staff from the ramparts of Red Fort

 The committee made several recommendations after reviewing the organizational structure of the three armies
 jisamen chif of dephence pad banane kii bhi baat thi
 However, it was only in the year 2000 that the Headquartered Integrated Defense Staff ((HQ IDS)) was formed to coordinate the three armies
 isaki adhyakshata ek thri star adhikari karata hai, jo chif of stoff cameti ko report karata he
 However, in 2012, the retired bureaucrat Naresh Chandra Committee presented a report related to defense reforms
 jisamen unhone five star chif of dephence staff kii jagah four star Chiefs of Staff Committee chairman kii sthai niyukti kii sifarish kii thi
 However this proposal was pending in the Ministry of Defense
 ab jaakar chif of dephence staff kii niyukti kar modi sarkaar ne kargil waar cameti or adwani kii adhyakshata vaale mantriyon ke samooh kii sifarish ko amalijama pahana diya he
