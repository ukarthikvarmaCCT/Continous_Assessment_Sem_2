 com / dt6sikjhly Election noise ended, Sadhvi Pragya Singh also won the election from Bhopal, but the patriotic statement of Nathuram Godse as a patriot did not leave BJP in pursuit
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke sadhvi ko mili notice kaa jawaab dene kii das din kii miyaad khatm ho gai he
 Now the state BJP is giving a roundabout reply in this matter, then the Congress is saying that all these things were just a show
 amit shah ne nathuram godse maamle main naaraazgi jataate hue 17 may ko sadhvi pragna ko notice bhej das din main jawaab maanga tha, lekin 27 taarikh ko das din puure hone ke baad bhi ab tak isaki anushaasan samiti kii prakriya shuru hone kii jaankaree bijepi main kisi ke paas nahin he
 After Amit Shah's decree in this case, the duration of Sadhvi Pragya's reply has ended, but the state BJP is trying to postpone it by turning around
 madhya pradesh bijepi ke pravaktaa deepak vijayawargeey kaa kahana he ki sari baaten party ke anushaasan samiti ke saamne he, anushaasan samiti jab bhi faisla degi ham usko saarvajanik karenge
 He had to answer in 10 days, what he has given now, he will be able to clear only after the report of the Disciplinary Committee
 haalanki 10 dinon kii samaysima biit jane ke baad bhi anushaasan samiti kii report naa aana saaf ishaara kar rahaa he ki bijepi ne is maamle ko prachand jeet ke baad thande baste main daal diya he
 In fact, on 16 May, Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur not only created controversy by calling Nathuram Godse a patriot in Agar Malwa, but also put the BJP in trouble
 loksabhaa chunaav main antim charan kaa matdaan bachaa tha aise main bayaan se naaraaz piem modi ne ye tak kah diya tha ki wo sadhvi pragna ko kabhi man se maaf nahin kar paaenge jiske baad sadhvi pragna ne apane bayaan par maafee maang lee thi, haalanki maafee kaam naa ai or rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne maamla anushaasan samiti ko bhej diya
 But even after 10 days, the Congress has raised questions if the Disciplinary Committee report did not come
 kamalnath sarkaar main mantri pisi sharma ne kaha ki bijepi sirf dikhaava kar rahi thi
 Amit Shah did not do any wrong message among the public, so just did the formalities and now the elections are over, then the statement of Sadhvi has been covered
 baharhaal jis tarah se bijepi main is puure maamle main chuppi kaa alam dikh rahaa he sawaal uthanaa laazmi he ki jeet kii siyaasi chakachaundh main kya sari bhul-chook ab maaf ho gai he? indigo aircraft engine failed in Mumbai, emergency landing Indigo aircraft engine continues to see disturbances in the aircraft, an Indigo aircraft has been landing in full emergency mode in Mumbai

 He has threatened to tell senior party leaders that if Dr

 On Thursday, when Vijay Goel was asked about the arrogance of the CM candidate inside the party, he said, "people do not mean who is the leader of the party
" log ye jaananaa chaahate hai ki dilli ke kayakalp ke liye bijepi kaa vijan kya he
 On the claim of CM post, Vijay Goyal said, 'I don't need to show strength, the work that i have done in 8 months is visible to my party and leaders
 ' haalanki unhone yah bhi mana ki is res main ve akele nahin hai
 Let me tell you that as a candidate for CM post, Dr

 The magistrate court said that there is no case against Gautam Gambhir for being a voter from two places
 saath hi court ne kaha ki do sthanon par voter ke rup main kisi ummidwar kaa panjikaran use chunaav ladane ke liye ayogy sabit nahin kar saktaa
 Atishine had alleged that Gambhir hid that he was registered as a voter in two assembly constituencies, a crime punishable under the law
 atirikt mukhya metropolitan magistrate samar vishaal ne kaha ki gambhir ke khilaaf aarope aadharahin hai or kanoonee taur par tik nahin sakate hai
 The court said that there is no evidence on record to show that even if a serious statement was made wrong, it could be an offense under Section 31 of the Representation of the People Act (RP)
 court ne kaha ki arapy adhinium kii dhara 17 (koi bhi vyakti ek se zyada nirvachan kshetra main matadaata ke taur par panjikrut nahin ho saktaa he) main sajaa kaa koi praavdhaan nahin he
 Therefore, if a person is registered as a voter in more than one constituency then it is not the same as any crime

 Baghel had asked him whether the quota could be fixed to provide diesel at affordable rates for small and marginal farmers for agricultural work? The government last month fixed the market rate for bulk consumers such as railways and state road transport corporations but there is currently no provision of diesel at different rates for consumers like petrol pumps and owners of big trains

 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne jeenyu ke vivaad par chaatr sangh ke adhyaksh kanhaiya kaa khul kar samarthan kiya he
 Nitish said in his communicators conference on Monday that the charge of treason against Kanhaiya was "a bit too much"
 nitish ne centre sarkaar ko chunauti di ki agar kanhaiya ke desh virdohi hone kaa unke paas saboot hai to wo desh ke saamne laae
 Nitish directly attributed the BJP to the JNU incident and said that all this is happening at the behest of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad
 nitish ne vampanthi netaaon kii us maang kaa bhi samarthan kiya ki police or prashasan ko saare saboot dene chahie ki aakhir wo koun chaatr hai jinhone desh virdohi naare lagaaye
 About Kanhaiya too, Nitish said that he had met him in the past and his belief that he is a young believer in the democratic system
 nitish ne kaha ki sipiai-sipiem par deshadroh kaa aarope lagane par koi vishwaas nahin karegaa
 Some people think that he who believes in his ideology is a patriot, so it is a fascist ideology
 nitish kumaar ne kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh ke bayaan par bhi kaha ki unhen bhi apane bayaan ke samarthan main saboot dene chahie
 Nitish conceded that JNU is being unnecessarily maligned
 "main centre sarkaar se jaananaa chahta hum ki jammu-kashmir vidhansabha main afjal guru ke paksh main prastaav laane vaale or abhiyaan chalaane vaale vidhayak ejeeniyar rashid se bijepi netaa ram madhav aakhir kyon mili
 Nitish said that if this news is true then i want to ask what the BJP is going to do against Ram Madhav
 tippaniyan Nitish argues that currently on the economic front, the central government wants to impose its language of patriotism on the country to divert the attention of the people to hide its failure
 nishchit rup se nitish ne khuleam kanhaiya kaa samarthan kar is mudde par puure desh main bijepi ke khilaaf morchabandi kaa hissaa hone par apni sahmati de di he
 Nitish assesses that no government can run a policy of oppression against students
 nitish ne jeenyu kii ghatana ke liye sidhe bijepi ko jimmevaar maanate hue kaha ki ye sabakuch akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad ke ishaare par ho rahaa he
 Nitish also supported the Left leaders' demand that the police and administration should provide all the evidence as to who are the students who raised anti-national slogans
 kanhaiya ke bare main bhi nitish ne kaha ki purv main wo unase mili the or unki dharna he ki wo loktrantik vyavastha main vishwaas karne vaale yuva hai
 Nitish said that no one would believe the CPI-CPM for accusing them of treason
 kuch logon ko lagata he ki jo unki vichaardhaara main vishwaas karata he vahi deshbhakt he, to ye fasivadi vichaardhaara he
 Nitish Kumar also said on the statement of Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh that he too should give evidence in support of his statement
 nitish ne mana ki jeenyu ko bevajaah badnaam kiya ja rahaa hai
 "I want to know from the central government why BJP leader Ram Madhav met MLA Engineer Rashid, who brought a proposal in favor of Afzal Guru in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly
 '' nitish ne kaha ki agar ye khabar sahi he to main poochna chahta hum ki bijepi ram madhav ke khilaaf kya karwaai karne vaali he
 The comments nitish kaa tark he ki filhal aarthik morche par centre sarkaar apni naakaami ko chhipaane ke liye logon kaa dhyaan bantane ke liye deshbhakti kii apni bhashaa desh par thopanaa chaahati he
 Certainly Nitish has openly supported Kanhaiya and has given his consent to be part of the barricade against the BJP across the country
 nitish kaa akalan he ki koi bhi sarkaar chaatro ke khilaaf daman kii niti apanaakar nahin chal sakati

 co / vkb0etynrx— Anurag Kashyap (@anuragkashyap72)september 19, 2018anuraag ne statement main likhaa - "main is vakt india main nahi hum or mujhe pataa chalaa ki sikh samudaay ko film main dikhaae gaye smoking seen par aapatti he
 This film is not made on any community
 balki ek akele vyakti ke chois par he
 We consulted Sikh people in every way to make this film
 'anuraag likhte hai- "jab ham film main shaadi vaala seen filma rahe the, tab hamase kaha gaya ki ham gurudware main nakli shaadi nahin filma sakate
 So we only completed the scene in the gurudwara
 jab hamane smoking vaala seen shoot kiya to wo seen sadak par shoot kiya gaya tha or lagbhag 150 se zyada log ye seen dekh rahe the
 When we asked him even then he said that the bus had to be removed before smoking
 hamane vahi banaaya jo hamane vahaan dekha or logon se janaa
 Not a single scene of the film has been shot without guidance
 "anuraag ne likhaa- "phir bhi agar kisi bhavanaaen is film kii vajah se aahat hui hai to main unase maafee maangata hum
 "anurag wrote," If someone is doing all this to gather attention, then i am glad that he has got this attention
 " anuraag ne maamla pataa chalate hi maafee maang lee he
 Now it remains to be seen whether the opinion of those who objected to the scenes of the film changes after the apology
 pakistan ke purv raashtrapati parvej musharraf ne kaha ki agar kashmir masale kaa hal nahin niklaa to pulavama jaisi ghatnaayen dobaaraa hongi
 Musharraf said in a special conversation with India Today on the Pulwama attack and the stand of the Government of Pakistan that the main problem behind all these incidents is Kashmir and it is necessary to resolve the Kashmir issue if these incidents are to be stopped
 india today group ke news diarector rahul kanwal or agxcutive editor anjana om kashyap se baatcheet main parvej musharraf ne pakistani sarkaar kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki pulavama hamale main jaish-e-mohammad kaa haath tha, isamen imran sarkaar kii kisi tarah kii bhoomika nahin thi
 So don't blame Pakistan for the attack
 mar nahin jayega pakistan
 
 
 On the diplomatic steps being taken by India for Pakistan, he said that nothing is going to happen
 pakistan kii arthvyavastha sahi raste par chal rahi he or hamen agar blike list main daalaa jaataa he to ham mar nahin jaaenge
 He said that if Prime Minister Narendra Modi attacks Pakistan, it would be the biggest mistake of his life
 pakistan ke purv senadhyaksh ne kaha ki pulavama hamale ke baad aapke pradhanmantri modi ke dil main koi aag nahin lagi hui, usase kahin zyada aag mere dil main tab lagati he jab hajaaron kashmiri maare jate hai
 He said that such things happen after every attack, but i have said, first you solve the basic problem, otherwise such incidents will happen
 bharat ko tathyon ko samajhnaa chahie, kashmir samasya ke hal ke bina yah sab rukne vaala nahin he
 About the terrorist organization Lashkar and its leader Hafiz Saeed, Musharraf said that Lashkar has been helping people in Kashmir since 1991
 aap agar kisi se bhi puuchhenge to vah pakistan main hafiz said ke samarthan main khadaa hoga, kyonki vah kashmiriyon ke haq kii ladaai lard rahaa he
 Why don't you tell us what your government is torturing with the people of Kashmir? pulavama hamale kaa dukhmushrraf ne kaha ki main 40 saal sena main rahaa hum, mere dil main bhi pulavama main maare gaye javaanon ke prati puri samvednaa he
 i have full sympathy for his family
 maine 1971 kii ladaai main apana sabase acha dost khoyaa he
 i know what it is like to lose loved ones
 unhone kaha ki main jaanata hum ki jang ke nattejey kya hote hai or pariwaron par kya bitati he
 a note from the Election Commission may increase the difficulty of 21 Aam Aadmi Party mlas
 artiai ke jawaab main chunaav ayog ne artiai activist vivek garg ko ek note bheja he
 It is written in this note that the Election Commission had sought information from the Chief Election Commissioner of Delhi about the law relating to Parliamentary Secretaries
 kanuunan sahi nahin he kejariwal sarkaar kaa kadamis jaankaree ke mutabik dilli ke siio ne chunaav ayog ko bataaya kidehali members of assembly( removal of disqualification) act 1997 ke mutabik dilli main sirf mukhyamantri ke daftar main sansadeey sachiv niyukt kiye jane kaa praavdhaan he
 It is also written that according to the law, there is no mention of the appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary in the office of the Minister in Delhi
 khud ko peedit dikhaanaa chaahate hai kejarivaldilli ke siem arvind kejariwal kab system se ladate-ladate kanoon se lard gaye or ulajh gaye ye unhen khud pataa nahin chalaa
 Because now Kejriwal and his advisors also know that their mlas are badly entangled in the Office of Profit
 isiilie ab kejariwal kii koshish puraani sarkaron kii misaal dekar apane aap ko peedit sabit karne kii he
 On the other hand, Somdutt and Alka Lamba have filed affidavits in the Election Commission in defense of themselves
 vahiin bijepi netaa arapy singh or vidhayak opi sharma ne kaha kickejariwal or unke vidhayakajuth ke pulindia hai
 Now they are all trying to avoid disqualification
 premium bas sarvice par bhi ghiri kejariwal sarkaaravahin sarkaar premium bas sarvice menghotale ke aarope sebhi buree tarah ghir gai he
 It is being told that the idea was to Ashish Khaitan, the head of the Delhi Dialogue Commission, but when he wanted to talk to him on the allegations of irregularities in the scheme, it was found that he was on leave
 ab is seva main gadabadi kii shikaayat ke baad kejariwal sarkaar ke ek mantri kii apane vibhaag se chuttee ho gai
 So the question is arising whether it is just a coincidence? Two files were made for premium bus service
 In Delhi Legislative Assembly, BJP leader Vijender Gupta told that two files of premium bus service scheme were made
 ek didisi ke chairman ashish khetaan ne banaai or phir baad main parivahan mantri gopal raay ne duusari file banaai
 The motive of the scheme is flawed and it was brought to the fore to benefit a bus company shuttle
 asibi se shikayatke baad raay se vibhaag le liya gaya
 The investigation will find out who was under pressure

 The busiest and most posh market of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh's capital, is roaming the streets of Hazratganj, about 30 policemen, including five women constables, led by the anti-romeo Squad - a deputy superintendent, DSP
 
 
 ye pulisavaale chaaron ore gum rahe hai, or aise logon ko talash kar rahe hai, jo ladakiyon-mahilaon ko pareshaan kar sakate hai, yani 'romeo' (mahilaon se chhedchhad karne waalon ko aamtaur par isi naam se pukaara jaataa he) ho sakate hai
 
 
 The boys who are sitting alone, or walking in groups, are the first to notice these policemen
 
 
 ek gali main apni motorcycle par akele baithe niraj ko inamen se paanch pulisavaalon ne 'gher' liya, or police adhikari ne sawaal daaga, "yahaan kyon baithe ho
 
 
 The Is it a picnic spot
 
 
 ?" Burbate-se Neeraj replied, "I work in a nearby restaurant
 
 
 ", or bataaya ki uski shift abhi-abhi khatm hui he, so, ghar lautne se pehle kuch der saans lenaa chahta hum
 
 
 The policeman, who checked Neeraj's Aadhaar card, said Gurrakar, "there is no need to sit here unnecessarily
 
 
 " sade kapade pahane ekh anya pulisavaale ne apane mobile phone se niraj kii tasviir khinchi, or jab unhen tasalli ho gai ki koi 'gadabad' nahin he, na ho sakati he, ve aage bad gaye
 
 
 Neeraj was shaken by this incident, and he refused to even talk to us
 
 
 
 
 
 And, shortly afterwards, things take an aggressive turn in the anti-romeo campaign
 
 
 dukaanon ke ek block ke saath pulisavaale saad khan ko gher lete hai, jo ek bench par akele baitha he
 
 
 Saad told the police that he had come with his wife, who was shopping at the women's clothing store
 
 
 ek varisht police adhikari kii ore se sawaal daaga jaataa he, "tum dukaan main bheetar kyon nahin gaye
 
 
 ? "before Saad is able to answer, his wife Nazira comes out of the store, and says to the husband" Come, let's go
 
 
 " The policemen immediately proceed, but Nazira is filled with anger by then
 
 
 "ise pareshaan karnaa kehete hai
 
 
 It cannot go with us within every shop
 
 
 yah dukaan mahilaon ke liye hai
 
 
 You cannot ask them why they are sitting here
 
 
 agar yah sharafat se dukaan ke baahar khadey hai, to isamen pareshaani kya he
 
 
 ? " haal hi main chunaav main shandaar jeet hasil kar sattashin hui bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke chunavi vaadon main se ek 'anti-romeo squad' kii shuruyaat buudhvaar ko kuch galat ho gai, jab tivi par dikh rahi tasveeron main pulisavaalon ko yuva jodon or group main gum rahe purushon ko pareshaan karte dekha gaya
 
 
 Newly appointed Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath then had to direct that the couples should not be targeted
 
 
 baharhaal, yah saaf nahin he ki police ke paas saarvajanik sthanon par 'romeo' ko pakadaney ke liye kya yojana he, lekin philhal ek police adhikari ke mutabik, unka iraadaa "collejon or anya jagahon par akele or grupon main gum rahe ladakon se sawaal karne or unki jaanch karne kaa he, taaki chhedchhad kaa iraadaa rakhane waalon ke man main bhi dar paidaa ho
 
 
 " pulisavaalon kaa yah group isi bazaar main lagbhag 30 minute or bitaata he, lekin koi 'romeo' haath nahin aata
 
 
 No one was taken into custody
 
 
 tippaniyan The senior-most police officer in this team, Shivram Yadav, tries to explain to us why they are questioning the men being found alone
 
 
 "ham poochhate hai, kya yah galat he
 
 
 The Is it wrong to ask someone why he is wandering alone
 
 
 ? agar vah dukaan par aayaa he, to thik he
 
 
 But what does it mean to roam alone
 
 
 ? main nahin samaj saktaa ki aap akele kyon baithe rahanaa chahenge
 
 
 You have come here from a motive - shopping
 
 
 ?" 
 
 
 to kya har akele ghoomane vaale ko gher lenaa jaays he
 
 
 The The officer's reply was, "how can anyone tell who he really is without talking to a lonely wanderer
" 
 
 ?" These policemen are roaming around, searching for people who can harass girls and women, ie 'romeo' (women molesters are usually called by this name)
 
 
 
 jo ladke akele baithe hai, yaa group banaakar tahal rahe hai, in pulisavaalon kii nazar main sabase pehle aa jate hai
 
 
 Neeraj, sitting alone on his motorcycle in a street, was 'surrounded' by five of these policemen, and the police officer questioned, "why are you sitting here
" 
 
 ? kya yah picnic spot he
 
 
 ? " budbudate-se niraj ne jawaab diya, "main paas ke hi restaraan main kaam karata hum

 "another policeman dressed in plain clothes took a picture of Neeraj from his mobile phone, and when he was satisfied that there was no 'mess' or could not happen, he went ahead
" 
 
 niraj is ghatana se hill gaya, or usne hamase baat tak karne se inkaar kar diya

 He could not translate 'bad bad' into his mind
 iske saath unhone yah bhi kaha ki unke bayaan ko tod marodakar pesh kiya gaya

 unhone kaha ki unhen khed he ki unki tippanee ko galat tareeke se pesh kiya gaya
 Pitroda said that 'I apologize
 is maamle ko badha-chadhaakar dikhaaya gaya
 Before giving Pitroda's clarification, the Congress (congress) has also given clarification on this issue on its behalf

 Javadekar said, "he (pitroda) said that the 1984 massacre took place
 to kya? desh ko yah puri tarah se asweekaarya he or ham ise bardaasht nahin kar sakate
 "the BJP leader accused the Congress of playing with the sentiments of the people

 pradhanmantri modi ne kaha, "1984 main desh bhar main hajaaron sikh bhai-bahanon kaa katleam hua lekin aaj congress kah rahi he jo hua so hua
 "it is a realization that the anti-sikh violence of 84 is still the sad touch of a large community on which the Congress is surrounded
 isliye fouran congress ne or punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ne khud ko is bayaan se alag kar liya
 Capt Amarinder Singh said, "this time will tell
 jaanch hone do ki 1984 main kisne kya kiya
 But let me tell Modi what happened in Godhra when he was CM? Aren't CM responsible for Law and Order? "but the attacks and the cleanup continue

 Have you ever put a pencil in your mouth? Sure, you must have done this many times, but can you put 92 pencils in your mouth simultaneously
 mumbai main science teacher ke ek teacher ne yah karnama kar dikhaaya he
 This teacher named 'maxi Mouth' is Dinesh Upadhyay, whose name has recorded 48 world records so far
 'maxi mouth' naam se mashhoor bharat ke is science teacher ne ek or record apane naam kar liya he
 This time, Dinesh Upadhyay has made a record of putting one thousand one straw in mouth
 isse pehle dinesh 92 pencil, 79 angoor, 12 mombatti or 5 golf ball ko ek saath munh main rakhane kaa record bana chuke hai
 For this reason, students have named this teacher 'maxi Mouth'
 ek video se mili preranadinesh upaadhyaay kehete hai ki meraa sapana bahut jald hi aise saare records apane naam karnaa he
 Dinesh has been trying to break such records since 2010
 isaki prerana unhen ek america record dharak tod diphysio ko dekh ke mili, jisane 70 pencilo ko ek saath munh main rakhaa tha
 After watching that video, Dinesh felt that he could do better than that
 karte hai chehre kaa masajadinesh upaadhyaay kaa kahana he ki unki is safalataa kaa raaj roj kii jane vaali prectis or unka itnaa bada munh he
 To increase the efficiency of his mouth, Dinesh keeps on trying to enlarge his mouth with fingers along with massaging the face
 apane gaalon ko rabar jaisaa karne ke liye wo apana munh jitna ho saktaa he, utana failaate rahete hai
 It took him four months to prepare himself mentally for the record
 apni pehali koshish ke dauraan unhone 2 number sies kii 100 pencilein lee thi, par sirf 50 pencilein hi daal paae the
 There is a popular saying that 'do not kick on someone's stomach even if kick on his back
 ' magar is desh main aaj se nahin, sadiyon se, gulaami se lekar aazaadee tak, pashaan yug se lekar aaj vaigyanik yug tak, bas ek hi kaam ho rahaa he or vah kaam yah he ki ham apane anndaata, apane paalanhaar, kisaan ke pet par laat maarthe hi chale ja rahe hai
 After all, what is the fault of this provider? Not only this, he is feeding the 100 crore population of this country with his hand
 jis paalanhaar kii puja honi chahie, ibaadat honi chahie, uskaa swaagat sammaan hona chahie, us kisaan ke pet par laat maari ja rahi he
 How long will this round last? And why would it work? sadiyon se peedi dar peedi pet par laat khaane vaala yah kisaan yadi jag gaya, yadi kahin sangathit ho gaya to parinaam kya hoga? kya kabhi sochaa he kisi ne? nahin sochaa he to ab soch lo, abhi bhi samay he, apane anndaata ke sabar kaa baandh tutaa nahin he, yadi sabar kaa baandh tut gaya, to nishchit hi pralay hogi
 Apart from this, no other scene is visible from a distance
 jis jameen par kisaan kheti kar rahaa he, uskaa lagaan sarkaar tay karti he
 The seed company decides the price of the seed that the farmer is sowing, the fertilizer company decides the price of fertilizer the farmer is using, the tractor company decides the price of the tractor with which the farmer is plowing the field
 Is, the price of diesel falling in it is decided by the government, the electricity department decides the price of tubewell, electricity, other equipment used in farming such as shovel, hoe, thresher, fodder machine, tractor tra Lee, and more of them go all cost manufacturer
 magar vidambnaa yah he ki kisaan kii fasalon kii keemat koi or tay karata he
 Why does the farmer not have this right? Why is he deprived of this right? jo kisaan dusron ke manamaani tareeke se tay keemton ke anusaar beej, khaad, pani kaa bhugtan kar apni khun paseene kii gadhi kamai se karata he, us kisaan ko apni fasal kii keemat swayan nirdhaarit karne kaa adhikaar kyon nahin he? When the shoe-making company can fix the price of its shoes at 399 rupees 99 paise and does not reduce even a new penny from it, then why are the farmers poor Gods, Gods trust, Guru Nanak's trust, Lord Jesus's trust? Everyone else has their own beliefs
 ve keemat nirdhaarit karte samay na bhagwaan se darate hai, na khuda se darate hai, na guru nanak se darate hai or na hi prabhu yishu se darate hai
 On the other hand, the crop which the farmer keeps more than his life, neither sees day, nor sees night, nor sees winter, nor sees summer, nor sees rain, nor sees sun, nor sees sun
 Is, neither sees the shade, there is no question of looking at the clock and hour
 din-raat, choubees ghante, bivi or bacchon va parivaar ke anya sadasyon ke saath juta rahata he khet khalihaan par! After so much hard work, when he sees the crop, his dreams become stark after seeing him
 vaataanukoolit kakshon main baithne vaale kisaan kii mehnat kii keemat tay karte hai, unki najar main ek gehun kaa dana boo to sau gehun ugenge, aisi hawaii soch rakhane vaale gehun kii keemat kya jane? jaanata to vah he jo use paidaa karata he
 Then why the cultivator does not have the right to set the price? After all, why is the farmer being denied this right? jab hamaara desh krishi pradhan desh he, arthath is desh kii arthvyavastha krishi par nirbhar he
 Yet why is agriculture not being given the status of industry
 vah isliye ki yadi krishi ko udyog kaa darja de diya gaya to kisaan ko apni fasal kii keemat swayan nirdhaarit karne kaa adhikaar hoga
 Then what will happen to the palladars of these adhatis and the palladars of the government? How will their aspirations be fulfilled? What will happen to those officers who today smell of the sweat of the farmer
 kisaan ke andar pravesh karte hi unhen baahar baithne kaa hukum de diya jaataa he
 These are just a few of the aspects that hinder agriculture from getting industry status
 upar se turra yah ki krishi ko udyog kaa darja milte hi aasmaan fat padegaa
 The farmer will die of hunger, as the tax burden will be imposed on the farmer
 ab in hawaii afasaron se koun puche ki bhaiya aaj kisaan kis tex se mukt he? vah aaj jitani bhi apni aavashyaktaaon kii vastu kharidta he, un sabhi par vah tex detaa he
 Yes, a farmer is being shown a daydream of avoiding a tax and that is 'income tax' i
e
 agriculture is exempt from income tax
 ab in numaayindon se koun puche ki jab kisaan ko inakam hogi, tabhi to vah tex degaa
 There is no cloth on the body, no shoes on the feet, the farmer poor is already weighed down by the debt burden
 yahi silsilaa peedi dar peedi, saat pidiyon se chalaa aa rahaa he
 Whether he is a farmer of the great storyteller Munshi Premchand with 'sava Ser Wheat' or today, a tractor farmer like Hariom Sharma, a writer like me, but both have the same story
 tab bhi kisaan ke pet par laat maari ja rahi thi or aaj bhi kisaan ke pet par laat maari ja rahi he
 But patience also has a limit, sir! Do not break the patience of the patient of this Annadata
 yadi aisa hua to phir pralay ke prakope se is desh ko koi nahin bachaa saktaa he, swayan anndaata bhi nahin

 dhadak ke baad jahnavi-ishan ke paas nahin he kaam? jaane kya he sachjab unase poocha gaya ki unki pasandida script kisi he is par jahnavi ne kaha- mujhe nahin lagata ki main is level par pahunchi hum ki main filmon kaa chayan karun
 Let us see what kind of script comes to me
 'dhadak' kii safalataa par boleen jahnavi, 'mujhe nahin lagata star ban gai hum'mujhe un kirdaaron ko play karnaa acha lagegaa jisase mujhe ek actor ke rup main kuch chunauti milti ho
 My mother also used to say that it is not a big deal to play a character, it is a matter of how well that character was played
 film dhadak kii baat karen to isamen jahnavi ke alaava ishan khatter lead role main hai
 This is Ishan's second film
 ye film marathi blockbster sarat kaa rimek he
 The film has grossed over 60 crores in 10 days of its release
 sant vinoba bhaave sachmuch hamaare liye ‘gunge kaa gud’ the
 We cannot write anything on them
 ek to do pidiyon kii duuri or phir kuch duuri bhugolic bhi
 i was born in Wardha, but after twenty-five years, i came to Wardha once or twice and even saw them from a distance in the meeting
 unke aasapaas tab itane log the ki apane aparichay kaa boj un par daalana thik nahin laga tha
 In this way Vinoba does not sit like a person in our mind
 vah to ek vichaar kii tarah kahin bheetar baithte chale gaye
 We consider this coincidence as our good fortune
 vinoba hamaare liye vyakti nahin, vichaar ban gaye
 But it was also our good fortune that his ideas did not become a subject of research for us
 vah shraddha kaa vishay banataa chalaa gaya
 Quantity does not remain important in faith
 vichaar padhanaa ek kaam he
 It has to be done continuously in research
 khoj-khoj kar nae-nae prasang padhanaa padataa he
 Read what others have not read and show it to others
 shaayad thodaa daraana bhi padataa he
 Then the thought journey is also a journey
 yatra main chale janaa he
 It has its ups and downs, its ups and downs
 aisi yatraaon main sab kuch hota he
 Many times the floor cannot be filled
 tab badi thakaan aati he
 Despair comes
 is sabase mukti mil gai hamen
 By becoming reverent in Vinoba thought
 tab hamaare liye ye vinoba vichaar dhruvatare ke samaan ban gaye hai
 We also have to go to the typical south instead of north, so standing poleward in the north does not allow us to wander easily even while going south
 is shraddha ke kaaran hamen jo bhi thodaa-sa prasad mila he, use ham kai mitra aapas main baantate rahete hai
 One of our comrades living in Punjab works as a clerk in the government, but by taking the time, he is now translating Vinoba's thoughts into Punjabi
 aaj se 30-45 baras pehle america ne ‘waijar’ naamak ek antariksh yaan bheja tha
 Like today, there were no televisions to run around the clock
 lekin akhabaaron main waijar kii khub charchaa thi
 It was then reported that this unmanned 'voyager' is no ordinary spacecraft
 lagbhag 35-40 varsh tak lagaataar gahan antariksh main chalate rahane ke baad yah pehali baar hamaare soramandal ko paar kar kisi agyaat padosi soramandal main pravesh karegaa
 a copper-like piece made of a special metal that never melts, fades, burns, rotts is also placed in the Voyager
 us par ek taraf hamaare is grah prithvi kaa vaigyanik bhashaa main puraa pataa likhaa he
 And also a message on the other side
 vigyaan kii bhashaa main hi likhaa gaya he ki ham yani hamaari yah maanav jati is brahmad main he kahaan, kaise dikhte hai, ham karte kya hai aadi
 When this Voyager was left, it was printed in the newspapers that in this small locality of our navigator, we have just a fence, there is no life on any planet other than our Earth in our solar system
 isiilie padosi mohalle ke kisi ghar tak waijar ek daakiye kii tarah jayega
 Will knock his door
 saubhaahgya se yadi kisi ne darwaja kholaa to yah daakiya use hamaari yah paati, hamaara yah sandesh degaa! to 35-40 baras pehle chode gaye waijar ne is varsh july main hamaara soramandal paar kar liya he
 At what distance the neighboring solar system is, when it will find a planet, house or house, it is not known
 aaj vinoba ke lekh main waijar prasang par yah sab likhane kii bhala kya tuk he? kaaran he vinoba kii bas ek pankti, jo unhone aise hi kisi prasang main kabhi kahi thi
 Do not remember the words properly
 bhav kuch aisa thah mujhe lagata he ki chitiyaan bhi hamen roj aise hi sandesh bhejti hai
 Just
 cheentee se brahmad tak, sookshm se vishaal tak, aadi se ant tak yaa kahen anadi se anant tak vinoba hamen haath pakad kar bade sneh se, bina daraaye yatra karavaate hai
 Vinoba's stature is very big in the minds of us small people
 hamaare liye ve itane bade hai ki is chote se man main unka samaa janaa unki udaartaa hi he
 We do not consider him the leader of Bhoodan
 ham unhen is rup main jaanate bhi nahin
 If you see them in that form, then you will get caught in various figures
 bhoomi, jameen kaa, maati kaa moh to kuch hajaaron saal se yahaan bana hua he
 People are not ready to give even the tip of the needle to their brother, in return, they make war like Mahabharata
 hamane vinoba ko bhudaan yaa jameen ke ek tukade tak simit kar nahin dekha he
 We have learned from them how to recognize the vastness of the sky in the human mind
 unke gundarshan va anya anek siddhant to adbhut hai
 Writing something on Vinoba means dumb jaggery
 ham uskaa swaad man main rakhte hai, bataa nahin sakate
 If you can tell, how does the sympathy interpretation of Vinoba work between Allopathy, Homeopathy, Naturopathy or how beautiful they explain the Vedas being imperfect, or what is their dignity in the largest to smallest institution today

 '' ipel-8 samaapt ho chukaa he
 The team of Mumbai Indians has also captured the trophy
 kuch khilaadiyon ke liye yah sijan behad shandaar or yaadgaar rahaa to kuch ne khaasaa maayoos kiya
 Let's have a look at which players have made the IPL-8 laggards
 virendra sahvaag:ipel 2015 main viru ne bahut niraash kiya
 Sehwag's form was so bad for Kings XI Punjab that he finally lost his place in the team
 viru ne apni 8 pariyon main is saal maatr 99 ran banaae
 Murali Vijay: One of the reasons for the failure of Kings XI Punjab was that the Punjab opener did not work at all
 vijay ne kai baar start to liya lekin use badi pari main tabdeel nahin kar paae
 Murali Vijay scored just 251 runs in 11 matches of IPL-8
 suresh raina:chennai super kings ke liye suresh raina har sijan kaaphi concystant rahe
 But this year Raina's bat could not leave the glow it was before
 raina ne har sijan chennai ke liye 400 se zyada ran banaae lekin is sijan unke balle se maatr 374 ran nikle to jarur, lekin vah chennai ko apane dam par ek bhi match nahin jita sake
 Yuvraj Singh: Yuvraj Singh was included in his team by Delhi Daredevils with a hefty amount of 16 crores
 lekin in rupayon ke badale yuvaraj ne dilli kii team ko maatr 248 ran die
 It is clear from these figures that Yuvraj Singh not only deserves to be a part of this booby team, but the captaincy of this team should also be bestowed on his shoulders
 glen maxwell:ipel-7 main kings ilevan ko final tak pahunchane main ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaale glen maxwell kaa balla is baar bilkul khamosh rahaa
 Maxwell scored just 145 runs in 11 matches this season
 angelo maithyuj:srilanka ke captain angelo maithyuj dilli dairedevills kii team main tisare sabase mahange khilaadi the
 But there was never any uniformity in his performance
 maithyuj ne dilli ke liye 11 maichon main maatr 144 ran banaae
 In bowling too, he took only 7 wickets while disappointing
 james foconor:world cap ke final main main of da match kaa khitaab jitkar ipel khilne aae foconor se kaaphi ummiden thim
 But his performance for Rajasthan Royals was also very mediocre
 foconor ke balle se jahaan maatr 144 ran nikle vahiin gendbaaji main bhi unhone niraash kiya or kul 8 wicket hi le sake
 Dinesh Karthik: Dinesh Karthik fits most in the role of wicket-keeper in the group of these laggards
 royal chalangers bangalore ne karthik ko 10
 5 crore was included in his team
 lekin inhone 16 maichon main maatr 141 ran banaae
 Michelle Johnson: No one but their players were responsible for the plight of Punjab
 johnson jo ki punjab ke mukhya astr the lekin vah puri tarah se misafaire kar gaye
 He took just 9 wickets in 9 matches
 sabase ajeeb baat yah rahi ki unki jamkar dhunaai hui or unhone 9
 Spending per over runs at an average of 37
 ishanth sharma:ipel-8 main sunrisers hyderabad kii gendbaaji kaaphi majboot maani ja rahi thi
 But the bowlers disappointed
 ishanth sharma us fehrist main sabase upar hai
 Ishant took just 1 wicket in 4 matches and his economy 11
 35 kii rahi
 Dale Steyn: Dale Steyn is also second to Ishant Sharma
 unhone 6 maichon main 8
 Won just 3 wickets with an economy of 94
 jammu kashmir main desh kii suraksha ke liye apni jaan dene vaale mohammad aarif pathan ko rajkeey sammaan ke saath aaj buudhvaar ko supurd e khaak kiya gaya
 Actually, Arif Pathan was shot in the chest by Pakistan in a ceasefire violation

 Politics has intensified regarding Padmavati in the Gujarat assembly elections
 bijepi-congress samet kai partiyaan film ke virodh main utar ai hai
 The BJP claimed that in reality Rani Padmavati had never met Alauddin Khilji

 BJP leader said that the story of the film is false, Gujarat BJP spokesperson and senior leader IK Jadeja has opened the front against Padmavati
 unhone daawa kiya ki real life main kabhi bhi rani padmavati or allaudin khilji kii mulaakaat nahin hui
 Historical lies have been fabricated in the film
 CBFC se kaha, phir se film screening karen
 Jadeja has written a letter to the Central Government, Election Commission along with the censor board demanding the release of the film after the Gujarat elections
 BJP kii maang- gujarat chunaav ke baad relies ho 'padmavati', rajput netaaon ko dikhaaen filmpahale party ke rajput netaaon ko dikhaae filmsanjay lila bhansaali kii film par sawaal uthaate hue jadeja ne kaha, party ke rajput netaaon ko film dikhaani chahie
 Releasing it without approval from the Rajput society can provoke violence
 jadeja kaa daawa he, kshatreey samaaj ke kai pratinidhiyon ne party ke saamne aise sakshya rakhen hai jisase sabit hota he ki film kii kahani main tathyon ke saath chhedchhad hui he
 He said that during the Gujarat elections, there was no violence due to the film, for this, the selected Rajput representatives should show the content of the film

 Those who have seen 'bahubali 2' must have felt a bit strange to see that Tamannaah's role is very less in the film
 tamanna jo 'bahubali: da bigning' kaa ahm hissaa thim, unhen 'bahubali 2' main khaas kirdaar kyon nahin diya gaya
 According to reports, 'baahubali' director SS Rajamouli has cut many of Tamanna's scenes from the film
 times of india kii report ke mutabik, tamanna is baat se bilkul bhi khush nahin hai
 It is being said that Rajamouli was not very happy with the visual effects, so he cut some scenes and most of those scenes were part of Tamanna
 'bahubali 2' kaa nayaa record, 1000 karod kamaane vaali pehali bhartiya filmareports yah bhi bataati hai ki tamanna ne film main apane role ke liye ghudsawaari or marshall arts kii training bhi lee thi
 Tamannaah also said that she has an important role in the film
 lekin film dekhne ke baad unhen bahut bura laga he
 PM Satish, the sound engineer of Bahubali 2 'bahubali 2', which is heavily influenced by Aamir's 'dangal' and Hrithik's 'krish', told a conversation with Indian Express, Rajamouli has set a standard quality
 hamaara culture he ki kisi bhi tarah agar paise bachate hai to bachaa liya jaae
 But Rajamouli does not think so at all
 rajamauli sound mixing ke antim din bhi kuch seens cat kar rahe the kyonki unke hisaab se kuch computer graphics achche nahin the
 Even after the film is mixed, they do not hesitate to cut the scene
 rajamauli kaa elaan, bahubali 2 ke baad ab bahubali 3 bhi aegiisi bich box offis par lagaataar nae record tod rahi 'bahubali 2' ne kamai kaa ek nayaa itihaas rach diya he
 Bahubali has become the first film in India to gross 1000 crores worldwide

 The Valsad seat is considered quite lucky

 However, earlier this seat was known as Bulsar

 After this Morarji Desai Congress won the election from here in 1971
 1977 main janata party ko is seat par jeet mili
 In 1980 and 1984, the Congress with Indira Gandhi won

 While he could not win in the Modi wave of 2014 and fought on BJP ticket
 si patel ne unhen shikast di
 In 1996, BJP won this seat for the first time and senior party leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee at the Center got an opportunity to run the government
 haalanki, yah sarkaar mahaj 13 din hi chal pai
 After this, in 1998, such a political situation happened that BJP led the power of the Center
 1999 se 2004 tak atal bihari vaajapeyi ne majbootee se apana puraa kaarykaal kiya
 The interesting figure is that in these three elections, BJP won from Valsad seat
 iske baad 2004 main congress jiti to centre main upie kii sarkaar bani
 In 2009, the Congress government was not very confident about repeating the government, but still Manmohan Singh ran the government for 5 years and in this election also the Congress won from Valsad seat

 varb or priprojishan, varb or edwarb, varb ke saath edwarb or priprojishan ke combination ko Phrasal varb kehete hai
 The meaning of Phrasal verb is quite different from the meaning of its original verb
 akasar ham Phrasal Verb ko puuraapadhaneke bajaae sirf pehle shabd ko padhate hai
 In this way, we make meaning of the sentence from the first word and are confused
 aaie jaanate hai a alfabet ke kuch aise hi Phrasal varb ke bare main:english main akasar hoti hai ye 10 galtiyaanpachhe for:ache kaa matlab hota he dard, dukh, pidaa
 But the phrasal verb Ache for is completely different from Ache
 Phrasal varb ache for kaa arth hota he kisi cheez yaa insaan ke liye tarasna yaa lalayit hona
 You can understand this more thoroughly with this example: She was lonely andaching forlove
 yani vah akeli thi or pyaar ke liye taras rahi thi
 Abide by: This Phrasal verb means to respect, obey
 udhaaharan ke liye: i don't need toabide bythe rules
 
 yani ki mujhe niyamon kaa paalan karne kii jarurat nahin he
 The word Account for: Account means Account
 lekin Phrasal varbadacchount forka matlab hota he kaaran bataanaa or jawaab dena
 For example: He was brought before the Board toaccount for this behavior

 pichley hi maheene march main ye report sarkaar ko saunpi gai jiskaa kam se kam do baar ucchstareey baithkon main zikr bhi ho chukaa he
 After thorough study and investigation, this committee has come to the conclusion that E-flows Assessment (EFA) is an important means of assessing the health of the river i
e
 River Health Regime (RHR)
 nadi kii sehat ko ek khaas str (RHR) par banaae rakhane ke liye zaruri he ki thos nitigat faisale lene ke baad hi sinchai or panbizli pariyojnaon ko manzuri di jaae or unki hadein tay kii jaaen
 Then, whether plans are being made to make them now or work has started on them
 report main ye belaag sifaarish bhi he ki zarurat pade to nadi ke bahaav ko bhayanak nuksaan pahunchaa rahi chaalu pariyojnaon ko bhi radd karnaa pade to kar diya jaae
 According to the report, the e-flow of the river determines the quality of its water and the aquatic life in it
 nadi kaa i-flo hi aadhyatmik, saanskrithik gatividhiyon ke kaayam rahane kii buniyaad bhi sabit hoga or nadi aadhaarit rojgaaron or udhyamon kii ridh sabit hoga
 The e-flow of the river is not only limited to the flow of water, but it also determines the amount of silt that goes along with the water
 nadi kii ye gaad nichle maidani ilaakon kii urvartaa ko banaae rakhane ke liye behad zaruri he
 That is why the committee report emphasizes that even after the construction of any project, the balance of water and silt in the river should remain the same as it was without any hindrance or dam
 khaas baat ye bhi he ki 32 pannon kii is report kii sifaarishein sirf ganga hi nahin balki desh bhar kii nadiyon par lagu hoti he
 This report cites several earlier reports prepared on the Ganges River
 inamen iaiti consorcium kii report or vivaadit bike chaturvedi cameti report shaamil hai

 One of these important suggestions is to identify the special animals that depend on the river, which can be considered as an indicator of its recovery during the entire journey of the river
 jaise is report main apper ganga basin main snow trout or golden mahashir machhliyon ko aisa indicater mana gaya he
 E-flo and MER should be decided based on how much water species can be saved and maintained in different shallow seasons of the river in different shallow seasons of the year
 report main nadi kii sehat ko paanch virgon main baanta gaya he
 Original, close to original, slightly affected, quite affected and distorted
 agar nadi kaa bahaav nunatam paryaavarniya zarurat(mer) se kam he to wo vikrut rup main he
 Most of the rivers in India (except a few rivers in the northeast and upper catchments of the Himalayas) are in a distorted form as there is no minimum flow
 agar nadi kaa bahaav beete kai saalon ke uske ausat bahaav ke baraabar he to nadi ko uske moulik rup main mana janaa chahie
 According to the committee, the e-flow of water in the river should be more than its minimum environmental requirement so that it can continue to play its fundamental role
 lekin nadi kii sehat kaa ye vivaran uske pani kii maatra se hi zyaada judaa he
 Things are yet to be decided on the quality of the water, its biological properties, etc
 tippaniyan According to the report, maintaining minimum flow of water is the need of not only the river but also the people and society
 agar ye nunatam had bhi nahin banaae rakhi gai to nadi kaa vikrut rup uske echosystem ko khatm kar degaa jiskaa doorgaami asar insaani samaaj par bhi jald hi dikhaai degaa
 Renowned environmentalist Himanshu Thakkar believes that if the government takes this latest report of its own committee made by the Ministry of Water Resources seriously and corrects its stance in the Supreme Court, then it will answer many difficult questions in front of itself

 Only you will get it
 report par amal se naa sirf ganga balki desh bhar kii nadiyon ko nirmal or aviral banane kaa rasta khul saktaa he
 The special thing is that the recommendations of this 32-page report apply not only to the Ganges but to the rivers across the country
 is report main ganga nadi par taiyaar kii gai purv kii kai reporton kaa hawala diya gaya he
 These include the IIT Consortium report and the disputed BK Chaturvedi Committee report
 lekin hairaani kii baat ye he ki ganga basin ke cumulative impact acesment par wild life institute of india kii report kaa zikr isamen nahin he jabaki ye report ganga basin par taiyaar sabase bharosemand reporton main se ek maani jaati he
 The committee has also suggested ways to assess the e-flow of the river's environment, and the Minimum Environment requirement-mer
 inamen se ek ahm suzav ye he ki nadi par ashrith un khaas jeev jantuon kii pahchaan kii jaae jo nadi kii puri yatra ke dauraan uske swasth hone kaa indicater maane ja sakate hai
 As such, snow trout and golden Mahaseer fishes in the Upper Ganges basin have been considered as such indicators in this report
 nadi ke puure uthle or gahare raste main saal ke alag-alag mausamon main kahaan kitna pani banaae rakhkar aise jeev jantuon kii prajati ko bachaae or badaye rakhaa ja saktaa he usee ke aadhaar par i flo or MER ko tay kiya janaa chahie
 The report has divided the health of the river into five sections
 moulik, moulik ke qareeb, thodaa prabhavit, kaafii prabhavit or vikrut rup
 If the river flow is less than the minimum environmental requirement (MER), it is in a distorted form
 bharat main zyaadaatar nadiyaan (uttar purv or himalay ke upree cachament kii kuch nadiyon ko chhodkar) vikrut rup main hai kyonki unamem nunatam bahaav bhi nahin he
 If the flow of a river is equal to its average flow over the years, then the river should be considered as its original form
 cameti ke mutabik nadi main pani kaa i flo uske MER yani nunatam paryaavarniya zarurat se zyaada hona chahie taaki wo apni moulik bhoomika ko nibhaati rah sake
 But this description of the health of the river is more than the amount of its water
 pani kii quality, uske jaivik gun vagairah par baaten tay honi abhi baaki hai
 The comments report ke mutabik pani kaa nunatam bahaav banaae rakhana nadi hi nahin logon or samaaj kii bhi zarurat he
 If this minimum extent is not maintained, then the distorted form of the river will end its ecosystem, which will have a far-reaching effect on human society too soon
 jane-maane paryaavaranvid himanshu thakkar kaa maananaa he ki apane hi jal sansaadhan mantralay kii banaai cameti kii is sabase tazaa report ko hi agar sarkaar gambhirtha se le or supreme court main apane rukh ko sudhaar le to use apane saamne khadey kai kathin sawaalon ke jawaab khud hi mil jaaenge
 The implementation of the report can open not only the Ganges but also the way to make the rivers across the country clean and continuous
 cameti ne nadi ke paryaavaran bahaav yani i-flo ke akalan ke tareeke or nunatam paryaavarniya zarurat (minimum Environment requirement-mer) ko bhi tay karne ke liye suzav die hai
 One of these important suggestions is to identify the special animals that depend on the river, which can be considered as an indicator of its recovery during the entire journey of the river
 jaise is report main apper ganga basin main snow trout or golden mahashir machhliyon ko aisa indicater mana gaya he
 E-flo and MER should be decided based on how much water species can be saved and maintained in different shallow seasons of the river in different shallow seasons of the year
 report main nadi kii sehat ko paanch virgon main baanta gaya he
 Original, close to original, slightly affected, quite affected and distorted
 agar nadi kaa bahaav nunatam paryaavarniya zarurat(mer) se kam he to wo vikrut rup main he
 Most of the rivers in India (except a few rivers in the northeast and upper catchments of the Himalayas) are in a distorted form as there is no minimum flow
 agar nadi kaa bahaav beete kai saalon ke uske ausat bahaav ke baraabar he to nadi ko uske moulik rup main mana janaa chahie
 According to the committee, the e-flow of water in the river should be more than its minimum environmental requirement so that it can continue to play its fundamental role
 lekin nadi kii sehat kaa ye vivaran uske pani kii maatra se hi zyaada judaa he
 Things are yet to be decided on the quality of the water, its biological properties, etc
 tippaniyan According to the report, maintaining minimum flow of water is the need of not only the river but also the people and society
 agar ye nunatam had bhi nahin banaae rakhi gai to nadi kaa vikrut rup uske echosystem ko khatm kar degaa jiskaa doorgaami asar insaani samaaj par bhi jald hi dikhaai degaa
 Renowned environmentalist Himanshu Thakkar believes that if the government takes this latest report of its own committee made by the Ministry of Water Resources seriously and corrects its stance in the Supreme Court, then it will answer many difficult questions in front of itself
 Only you will get it
 report par amal se naa sirf ganga balki desh bhar kii nadiyon ko nirmal or aviral banane kaa rasta khul saktaa he
 If the river flow is less than the minimum environmental requirement (MER), it is in a distorted form
 bharat main zyaadaatar nadiyaan (uttar purv or himalay ke upree cachament kii kuch nadiyon ko chhodkar) vikrut rup main hai kyonki unamem nunatam bahaav bhi nahin he
 If the flow of a river is equal to its average flow over the years, then the river should be considered as its original form
 cameti ke mutabik nadi main pani kaa i flo uske MER yani nunatam paryaavarniya zarurat se zyaada hona chahie taaki wo apni moulik bhoomika ko nibhaati rah sake
 But this description of the health of the river is more than the amount of its water
 pani kii quality, uske jaivik gun vagairah par baaten tay honi abhi baaki hai
 The comments report ke mutabik pani kaa nunatam bahaav banaae rakhana nadi hi nahin logon or samaaj kii bhi zarurat he
 If this minimum extent is not maintained, then the distorted form of the river will end its ecosystem, which will have a far-reaching effect on human society too soon
 jane-maane paryaavaranvid himanshu thakkar kaa maananaa he ki apane hi jal sansaadhan mantralay kii banaai cameti kii is sabase tazaa report ko hi agar sarkaar gambhirtha se le or supreme court main apane rukh ko sudhaar le to use apane saamne khadey kai kathin sawaalon ke jawaab khud hi mil jaaenge
 The implementation of the report can open not only the Ganges but also the way to make the rivers across the country clean and continuous
 agar nadi kaa bahaav beete kai saalon ke uske ausat bahaav ke baraabar he to nadi ko uske moulik rup main mana janaa chahie
