 The names of the beneficiaries were being called, when the turn of the check came from a woman who had a small child in her lap
 manch par bheed dekhakar is mahila ne paas hi main khadi punam mahajan ko apana baccha thamaya or check lene ke liye aage bad gayi
 Poonam too adopted the child with great ease and remained in his lap till the completion of the process of taking the check by the woman

 sirsa loksabhaa seat kaa gathan 1962 ko hua tha, tab se is seat par bijepi ko kabhi kamyaabi nahin mili he
 However, it is said that the BJP never appeared serious about this reserved seat, so in 2014 the BJP left this seat for the HJC after the alliance
 sirsa loksabhaa seat par zyaadaatar congress ke ummidavaar hi jitate rahe hai
 Since 1962, the Congress has won this seat 9 times so far, while INLD got the opportunity to tie Vijay's face here in 1989, 1998, 1999 and 2014
 bijepi ne is seat par 2004 main mahabir prasad ko ummidavaar banaaya tha, jinhen 13
 68 percent votes were received

 The city of Sirsa was captured by the British ruler in 1819
 baad main ise dilli kshetra ke uttari-pashchimi jile kaa ek hissaa bana diya tha
 In 1837, the British made Bhatiana district and made Sirsa its headquarters
 lekin 1857 main angrejon ko yahaan se khaded diya gaya
 Sirsa city was also the victim of Mohammed Ghaznavi's invasions
 saraswati nadi ke tat par basaa hone ke kaaran pehle sirsa kaa naam saraswati nagar tha
 Sirsa was also named Sirsuti in ancient times, while there is evidence of Sirsika in many places
 lekin samay ke saath iskaa naam sirsa prachlit ho gaya

 The people of the procession side also explained and extinguished
 tab kareeb 15 ghante baad shaadi hui
 The groom said that much happened in the confusion
 dainik bhaskar ke mutabik, upi ke gajipur jile ke sakalenaabad se somvaar kii raat ai baraat bihar ke mujffarpur ke bhagavanpur sthit ek hotel main tehrai gai thi
 When the groom did not like the bride during Jaimala, she refused to marry

 There was also a scuffle
 duulhe kii bhabhi par kaan bharne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaaphi bura-bhala bhi kaha

 In the 43rd match of the ICC World Cup-2019, the teams of Pakistan and Bangladesh will face face-to-face at the Lord's ground in London on Friday
 donon tiimon ke world cap kaa safar samaapt ho chukaa he
 Pakistan has to win for the journey ahead of the World Cup by such a difference, which is considered impossible
 england dwaara newjiland ko haraae jane ke baad pakistan ke liye semifinal main janaa mumkin hota nahin dikh rahaa he
 Pakistan can go ahead only when batting first, score 400 and then dismiss Bangladesh for 84 runs
 toss haarate hi pakistan kaa safar samaptsamikaran yah he ki agar pakistan toss haar jaataa he to vah semifinal kii daud se baahar ho jayega or agar toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji letaa he to use yah match 316 ranon se har haal main jeetna hoga
 This is the difference of victory, which no team has achieved in ODI history so far
 england kii jeet sebigadaa1992 kaa ganitis world cap main pakistan kaa ab tak kaa safar 1992 kii tarah hi rahaa he
 The only difference is that the Pakistani team reached the knockout level that year, but this year its paths are quite difficult
 bharat or australia ke haathon mili haar ke baad pakistani team ne shandaar vaapasi karte hue dakshin africa, newjiland or pakistan ko haraaya tha or khud ko semifinal kii daud main banaae rakhaa tha
 But for this he had to depend on England's match
 agar england kii team apane donon match haar jaati to phir pakistan kaa rasta saaf ho jaataa
 Bangladesh has the power to defeat Pakistan
 On the other hand, Bangladesh's team has done well in this World Cup
 yah team semifinal kii daud main nahin he, lekin usne apane harfanmaulaa khilaadi shaakib al hasan ke dam par behtareen pradarshan kar apane prashansakon ko khushi manaane kaa mauka diya he
 Bangladesh team would like to bid farewell to the World Cup with a win and has the full power to defeat Pakistan

 gehun kii fasal par bemausam barsaat kii maar jhelane vaale kisaanon ko rahat dene ke liye modi sarkaar ne anaaj main tut-foot ke naam par kaate gaye 10 rupee 88 paise lautaane kii baat kahi thi
 But even after 2 months, the farmers have not yet received their dues
 chandigarh ke kisaan karnel singh ne punjab kii kharad mandi main jo gehun bechaa tha, uske unhen puure daam mili yani 1450 rupee prati quintal, lekin chandigarh kii mandi main kharid epasiai (food korporation of india) ne kii to lagbhag 11 rupee kam mili
 The Center had promised to make up for the loss when the farmers' organizations raised an issue
 centre sarkaar punjab ke kisaanon kii bakaayaa 2 karod rupee kii raashi dene se peeche hat rahi he
 The amount may seem small to hear, but here the matter is promising
 karnel singh kehete hai ki punjab main to puure paise mili, lekin chandigarh main kam mili the
 Now so much time has passed, i do not know if i will get it or not
 muktsar anaaj mandi ke aadhati balraj singh kaa kahana he ki kisaanon ko hamane puraa pement diya, lekin hamen puri raqam abhi tak nahin mili he
 The state government is avoiding talk at the center and center
 in donon ke bich hamaara nuksaan ho rahaa he
 Central government agency FCI has a total of 18 in Punjab
 48 lakh metric ton gehun sidhe kisaanon se kharida tha, jabaki 80 lakh ton anaaj kii kharid punjab sarkaar kii agenciyon ke zarie hui
 At the same time, there was a lot of politics on the delay in the purchase
 bhartiya kisaan union ke netaa balbir singh rajeval bataate hai ki desh main pehali baar kisi sarkaar ne vailu cat lagaaya
 While the Punjab government agencies gave the entire MSP (minimum Support Price) to the farmers, the FCI paid only Rs 1439, which they are now reluctant to give
 centre sarkaar ke vaade ke ulat april ko jari epasiai ke aadesh ke mutabik, adhikariyon ko spasht nirdesh die gaye hai ki achhatiyon ko unki taraf se jo pement kii jaae, vah vailu cat kii raashi kaat kar ho
 But in the letter, it has also been said that the farmers should pay full MSP, because the Badal government has promised to compensate the loss, but the Chief Minister is saying that the responsibility is with the Center
 tippaniyan Asked questions about this, Prakash Singh Badal said that whatever purchase we make is for the central government, it is their responsibility to pay
 jo bhi dena he, centre hi degaa
 This is a double whammy on farmers of Punjab who sold grain directly to FCI
 pehle to rajya sarkaar ne fasal ke kharaab hone kaa muaavja nahin diya or ab centre sarkaar apane vaade se mukar rahi he
 There is a matter of relief for the farmers involved in the debt trap, but the relief is not reaching them
 shaayad isliye surajeet singh jaise kisaan rahul gandhi se madad kaa bharosa milane ke baavjood aatmahatya kar rahe hai
 The central government is holding back from giving the arrears of Rs 2 crore to the farmers of Punjab
 ye raqam sunne main bhale hi kam lag rahi ho, lekin yahaan baat vaadakhilaphi kii he
 Karnail Singh says that in Punjab, full money was received, but less was found in Chandigarh
 ab itnaa samay biit gaya, pataa nahin ab milegaa bhi yaa nahin
 Balraj Singh, the agent of Muktsar Grain Market, says that we have given full payment to the farmers, but we have not received the full amount yet
 rajya sarkaar centre par baat taal rahi he or centre rajya par
 We are losing between these two
 centre sarkaar kii agency epasiai ne punjab main kul 18
 48 lakh metric tonnes of wheat was purchased directly from farmers, while 80 lakh tonnes of food grains were procured through agencies of the Punjab government
 vahiin, kharid main deree par khub siyasat bhi hui thi
 Balbir Singh Rajewal, leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, says that for the first time in the country, a government imposed a value cut
 punjab sarkaar kii agenciyon ne to kisaanon ko puraa emspi (nunatam samarthan mulya) diya, lekin epasiai ne sirf 1439 rupee ke hisaab se pement kiya, jise dene main ab wo anakani kar rahi he
 Contrary to the Central Government's promise, according to the FCI order issued in April, the authorities have been given clear instructions that the payment made to the agents on their behalf should be deducted from the value cut amount
 lekin khat main saath hi ye bhi kaha gaya he ki aadhati kisaanon ko puraa emspi adaa karen, kyonki nuksaan kii bharpai kaa vaada badal sarkaar ne kiya he, lekin mukhyamantri kah rahe hai ki ye zimmedaari to centre kii he
 The comments is babat sawaal poochne par prakaash singh badal ne kaha ki ham jo bhi kharid karte hai, wo kharid centre sarkaar ke liye hoti he, pement karnaa unki zimmedaari he
 Whatever is to be given, the center will give it
 punjab ke jin kisaanon ne sidhe epasiai ko anaaj bechaa tha, un par ye dohari maar he
 First, the state government did not give compensation for the crop failure and now the central government is backing from its promise
 karz ke jaal main uljhe kisaanon ke liye raahat kii baat to ho rahi he, magar raahat un tak pahunch nahin paa rahi
 Perhaps this is why farmers like Surjit Singh are committing suicide despite getting the help of Rahul Gandhi

 Do you recognize Akhilesh Yadav, son of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and SP President Mulayam Singh Yadav? Whatever your answer, Akhilesh feels that people do not recognize him
 mangalvaar ko pradesh kii rajdhani lakhanu main jab unhone apana yah 'dard' sabake saamne rakhaa to ekbargi sab hairaan rah gaye
 Born in a large political family in UP, son of former Defense Minister of India Mulayam Singh and UP CM Akhilesh Yadav is upset with the people of the state
 vajah he janata main ghatati lokapriyata kii phikr
 Yes, if face recognition is considered to be a measure of popularity, then the common people who came to meet him on at least two occasions in the past could not recognize Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav
 na CM ko pahachaanaa, na mantri koor to or jor de kar poochne par bhi ye log naa to upi vidhansabha adhyaksh mata prasad pandey, na hi peedbludi mantri shivpal yadav or na hi siem akhilesh yadav ko pahchaan paae
 This put Akhilesh Yadav in confusion
 khaas baat ye thi ki akhilesh us vakt bemausam barsaat se peedit kisaanon ko raahat raashi baant rahe the
 The Chief Minister claims that no such state of the land has been distributed by any other state nor by the Central Government
 aise main madad le rahe kisaan or unke pariwaron kaa unhen naa pahchaan paanaa unhen sakate main daal gaya
 Akhilesh said, 'tell me, you are providing help of 7 to 12 lakhs
 fasalon kaa nuksaan hua vahaan bhi madad pahunchaai
 Just when there was a program in the Chief Minister's office where a member was helping
 lok nirmaan mantri or vidhaan sabha adhyaksh the mere saath
 Asked the woman who was being helped that you recognize the Minister of Public Works, she said no
 spikar sahab ko bhi nahin pahachaanati thi wo
 She did not even recognize us

 According to him, the SP government is constantly working for the development of the state and the welfare of the people, but this work is not being publicized properly
 iske liye akhilesh yadav ne party ke kaaryakarta or sarkaar ko to jimmedaar tehraaya hi
 Along with this, it was also said that the media of the state where the people are not able to recognize their CM should also take a lesson from this incident
 jab unase poocha gaya ki log unhen kyon nahin pahchaan paa rahe hai, to unhone kaha, 'dekhiye ham logon ko galatfahami main nahin rahanaa chahie
 Many times people do not recognize
 janeshwar mishra ji ne kaha tha ek baar mujhako

 And we should do it with your help
 balki hamaare-aapke liye bhi sabak he ki ham aapse madad le rahe hai tab bhi nahin pahunch rahi baat
 And our worker too is unable to reach
 or sarkaar bhi nahin bataa paa rahi he ki ye yojana samaajawaadee party ne
 
 
 
 dekho ab ye aarope mat lagaana kii kaaryakarta kaam nahin kar rahaa he
 i am saying that our workers should exercise in the political system that socialist government is giving socialist pension
 samaajawaadee sarkaar he isaliye kisaanon ko itani raahat di gai he
 The SP is the government, so the accident insurance of the farmers has been given Rs five lakh and many families have been given Rs 12 lakh each
 puure pradesh main
 "is there a pre-election haggling? Obviously, after the results of the last Lok Sabha elections, the manner in which the UP government has emphasized on the development agenda, the spontaneity of not reaching its point is visible from the talk of CM Akhilesh Yadav
 vidhaan sabha kaa 2017 main hone vaala chunaav sir par he or aise main nai nai yojanaon ke tabadatod udghaatan or locarpan kar samaajawaadee party kii sarkaar votaron ke bich apni chhavi sudhaarna chaahati he
 Probably because after the unseasonal rain to help the farmers, where the Center has so far sent only Rs 253 crore, the UP government has distributed Rs 1400 crore
 aise main unki sarkaar se madad paane vaale kisaanon or aam logon kaa unako na pahchaan paanaa siem akhilesh yadav ko buree tarah khatak rahaa he
 Let me tell you that this is the longest maneuver between India and America
 is saal yah america ke washington ke paas america sena ke base main chal rahaa he

 On the one hand, incidents of murders are increasing on the basis of mob litching and ideology, while on the other hand hate statements are also increasing continuously
 ye bayaan saansadon-vidhayakon or pravaktaaon kii ore se die jate hai
 Political parties avoid them, but these statements that divide the society and incite them to violence leave their impact

 He said in an event organized on Kargil Vijay Diwas that if he were the Home Minister, he would have ordered the intellectuals to shoot

 unhone yah bhi kaha ki desh ko sabase zyada buddhijiviyon or dharmanirpekshon se hi khatara he

 This is 520 percent more than UPA-2

 unhone kaha tha ki camere dekhte hi pravachan dekar media ko masala na den
 Despite this, the rhetoric of BJP leaders continues
 udhar congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne ek hafte ke bheetar hi duusari baar party netaaon ko bayaanbaji se baj aane kii chetavanee di he
 He has reminded the leaders of Laxman Rekha and said that the party will not hesitate to take action against those who transcend it
 to aisa kyon he ki alaakaman kii chetavanee ke baavjood netaa bhadakaau bayaan dene se baaj nahin aa rahe? or nafrat failaane vaale netaaon ke khilaaf kya karrwai honi chahie? jaahir he jab tak partiyon kii ore se kadi karrwai nahin kii jaati, is tarah ke bayanon kaa silsilaa thamane vaala nahin he
 The first thing to talk about is Basavan Gowda Patil, MLA from Vijaypur, Karnataka BJP
 unhone kargil vijay diwas par yojit ek kaarykram main kaha ki agar ve grahamantri hote to buddhijiviyon ko goli maarane kaa aadesh de dete
 He called liberals and intellectuals as anti-nationals
 baswan gauda ke mutabik buddhijivi desh kii sari suvidhaon kaa istemaal karte hai, jiske liye janata tex detii he or uske baad bhartiya sena ke khilaaf hi narebaaji karti he
 He also said that the country is most threatened by intellectuals and secularists
 baswan gauda isse pehle bhi vivaadit bayaan de chuke hai, jab unhone parshadon se muslimon kii madad na karne kii apil kii thi
 This is the statement of the leader of Karnataka in which journalist Gauri Lankesh is shot and killed in public
 rajya police ke mutabik unki hatya main hindutvvaadi takaton kaa haath he
 Not only Karnataka, there have been attacks on intellectuals and liberals in many states of the country
 nafrat failaane ke bayanon kaa silsilaa uttar pradesh main bhi jari he
 BJP MP Hariom Pandey from Ambedkarnagar said that if the population of Muslims is not controlled then a new country like Pakistan will take shape in India

 Congress spokesperson Rajiv Tyagi recently used extremely derogatory words to anchor in a TV debate
 congress alaakaman ke kehane par unhone maafee maangi
 The comments enditivi ne nafrat failaane vaale bayanon kaa vishleshan kiya to pataa chalaa ki aise bayaan dene vaale adhikansh janpratinidhi or bade netaa hai
 Since 2014, there have been 130 hate speeches
 yah upie-2 ke mukaable 520 fisadi zyada hai
 BJP leaders are at the forefront of making such statements
 91 fisadi bayaan bijepi netaaon ke hai
 Out of 130 such statements since 2014, 118 are from BJP leaders
 bijepi alaakaman bhi kai baar apane saasandon or vidhayakon ko tok chukaa he
 Once, BJP President Amit Shah has reprimanded all the mps who have created problems for the party with inflammatory speeches and statements
 piem narendra modi bhi kai baar tok chuke hai
 He had said that do not spice the media by giving discourses on seeing the cameras
 iske baavjood bijepi netaaon kii bayaanbaji kaa silsilaa lagaataar jari he

 unhone netaaon ko lakshmana rekha kii yaad dilaai he or kaha he ki jo ise laanghega uske khilaaf karrwai se party nahin hichakegi
 So why is it that despite the high command's warning, the leaders are not deterred from making inflammatory statements? And what action should be taken against hate leaders? Obviously, until such action is taken by the parties, the chain of such statements is not going to stop
 yah us karnataka ke netaa kaa bayaan he jis rajya main patrkaar gauri lankesh kii saream goli maar kar hatya kar di jaati he

 com / ahkd2cnet0 Prime Minister Narendra Modi will once again be in Mamta Banerjee's stronghold from West to the center after the Kolkata Police vs CBI case
 piem pashchim bengal ke jalpaigudi kaa daura karenge
 Hence the political mercury of West Bengal is expected to remain at its peak
 piem modi jalpaigudi main rashtriya rajmarg-31 di ke falakata-salsalabari khand ko chaar len kiye jane kii aadharshila rakhenge
 a statement issued from the PMO said that this 41 of the National Highway
 7 kilometre lanbaa khand pashchim bengal ke jalpaigudi jile main aata he or ise kareeb 1938 karod rupee kii laagat se banaaya jayega
 The statement said that Modi will also inaugurate the new circuit bench of the High Court in Jalpaiguri
 vahiin jalpaigudi ke churabhandar se ai khabar ke mutabik modi yahaan ek saarvajanik raily ko bhi sambodhit karenge
 This will be Modi's third rally in the state in a week
 haalanki unki raily sthal ke liye manjuuri ko lekar bhi bhaajapa or trinmul congress ke bich aarope-pratyarope lagaae ja rahe hai
 This comes three days after Mamata Banerjee ended a sit-in protest against the cbi's 'politically motivated' interrogation of Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar in the Saradha chit fund scam
 yahaan bhaajapa sutron ke mutabik modi jile main is manch kaa istemaal banerjee ke aaropon kaa 'makul' jawaab dene ke liye kar sakate hai or chunaavon se pehle party kaaryakartaaon main josh bhi bharenge
 a senior BJP leader said, "apart from giving a message to the party workers, we hope that Modi ji will also give a proper reply to the Trinamool Congress unconstitutional strike
 'bhaajapa ne pichley loksabhaa chunaavon main rajya kii 42 siton main se sirf do siten jiti thim lekin party adhyaksh amit shah ne is baar yahaan se 23 siten jeetne kaa mahatvakankshi lakshya rakhaa he
 Like the cases of other BJP leaders, the party had trouble finding a venue for the Prime Minister's meeting in Jalpaiguri
 jalpaigudi ke sarkari college or usase sate sports athurity of india limited ke maidan ke liye manjuuri nahin milane ke baad party ko jalpaigudi shahar se kareeb 20 kilometre dur kheti kii jameen ko kiraaye par lekar sabha ke aayojan ke liye baadhya hona padaa
 BJP state general secretary Raju Banerjee alleged that local Trinamool Congress leaders are warning bus operators not to take supporters of the saffron party to the rally venue in their vehicles
 trinmul congress ke vidhayak saurav chakrabarti ne haalanki in aaropon ko “niraadhaar” qaraar diya
 About 12-15 lakh rupees are spent every year in the maintenance of the tree, in a state where 51 farmers have committed suicide for little debt
 yah or baat he ki jis vishvavidhyalay ke naam par bodhi vriksh ko ropa gaya, paanch saal baad uski boundry tak tut gai he
 The university is being run in a private building by paying a rent of about 20 lakhs

 In such a situation, there is confusion about the release of 'padmavat'
 pradesh main ratlam, indore or ujjain main zyada virodh ho rahaa he
 In view of the protest, bus services between Indore and Gujarat have been stopped
 purv vitt mantri pi
 Chidambaram while discussing the current state of the Congress said that the Congress had to pay the price for ignoring the party's organization
 varisht patrkaar sagarika ghosh kii kitaab 'indira' ke vimochan main aae chidambaram ne kaha ki upie 1 or 2 main kaaryakartaaon or sanghathan kii upeksha hui
 Would have been nice if all UPA 2 ministers were not repeated
 jameen par kamjor hui partychidambaram ne kaha he ki dekhte hi dekhte jila or pradesh str par unki party kamjor hoti rahi or hamane kuch nahin kiya
 Pointing to the Congress President, he said that if Sonia Gandhi was the President of the party, then obviously she has a responsibility
 purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram ne congress kii maujuuda sthiti par charchaa karte hue kaha ki party ke sanghathan ko nazarandaaj karne kii keemat congress ko chukaani pad rahi he
 Formerly the Finance Minister said that during 2004 to 2014, the party organization was neglected
 unhone kaha ki pradesh str or jila str par sanghathan kii upeksha kii gai
 Chidambaram has said that the Congress is more vulnerable in the states, especially at the district and block level and this is unfortunate
 sonia gandhi thim jimmedaarajab chidambaram se poocha gaya ki kya sonia gandhi kii bhi jimmedaari banati he to chidambaram ne kaha ki jaahir si baat he wo adhyaksh hai to unki bhi jimmedaari he
 Commenting on the current political situation, Chidambaram said that today the Congress is facing a fierce and powerful machine like RSS
 aresas ek badi siyaasi takatjab unase poocha gaya ki 1977 main indira gandhi kii haar ke baad ki congress or maujuuda vakt kii congress kii kamjor sthiti main kya fark he tab unhone kaha ki tab indira gandhi kaa muqabla kuch purv congressi or thake hue samaajwaadiyon se tha lekin aaj aresas jaise shaktishaalee mashin se he
 Kangana Ranot's head was not getting the success of 'queen' and 'revolver Rani'
 kangana ne teen karod rupye ke ofer ko ek jatke main thukraa diya he
 She received this offer to dance in a Delhi wedding
 darasal film 'queen' kii safalataa ke baad unhen jabardast lokapriyata mili he
 This is the reason that he has got a lot of offers to perform in events
 kangana kii bahan rangoli kaa kahana he ki kangana ko aisa kaam karnaa kabhi nahin bhaayaa
 He has not danced in any such function till date
 vah apana sara dhyaan filmon par dena chaahati hai
 After the prohibition in Bihar, not only the general public is relaxed but the police is also playing the peace
 sharabbandi ke baad rajya main aparaadh kam hue hai to sadak par durghatnaon main bhi kami hui he
 Although the state government suddenly took the decision of complete prohibition, the decision of the government is getting tremendous support
 puure bihar kaa daura karne ke baad yah saaf ho jaataa he ki aam janata sharabbandi se bahut khush he
 The effect of prohibition in Bihar is not only because of the strict law made against prohibition of liquor, as well as the sting operation of Aaj Tak
 sting oparation main fanse sattadhari gathbandhan ke congressi vidhayak vinay verma par police kaa shikanja lagaataar kasata ja rahaa he
 Police are continuously raiding his Shikarpur residence and Patna residence for his arrest
 vidhayak ne diya tha sharaab kaa ofranrkatiyaganj ke vidhayak vinay verma neaj tak ke sting mensharab pilaane kaa ofer diya tha
 They have been booked under Shikarpur police station and Pataliputra police station in various sections under the liquor prohibition law
 utpaada evam madh nishedh vibhaag ne police ke sahyog se unke awaas par isliye chhapemari kii kyonki sting main unhone kaha tha ki unke patna or shikarpur sthit awaas par kai tarah ke videshi sharaab maujuud he
 He had also said that no one dared to come to his house and make it red
 halaki ilaake ke log jaanate hai ki vidhayak sharaab nahin pite hai
 He quit alcohol several years ago
 lekin unhen pine kaa nahin pilaane kaa shauk tha
 Due to this hobby, they have run away and are running again
 police lagaataar unhen giraftaar karne ke liye jaanch main teji laa rahi he
 Police asked for copy of sting operation from 'aaj Tak', in this regard, police has also asked for copy of sting operation
 jisase vidhayak ke khilaaf pukhta saboot jutaaye ja saken
 Vinay Verma, who won on the Congress ticket from Narkatiaganj Assembly in West Champaran, comes from the State Family
 shikarpur state se taalluk rakhane vaale vinay verma ke parivaar kaa ilaake main kaaphi rasookh he
 The police station in Narkatiaganj is Shikarpur
 yah thana aazaadee ke pehle shikarpur jane ke liye check post kii tarah tha
 Which was built for the protection of Shikarpur
 aaj haalat ye he ki shikarpur thana lagaataar vidhayak ke ghar par unki giraftaar ke liye dabish de rahaa he
 MLA has good image in the area MLA has good image in the area
 unka puraa parivaar rajnatik he
 His father was an MLA, his cousin Dilip Verma has been an MLA several times
 ek or chachere bhai betia se saansad rah chuke hai or chote chachere bhai kii patni bhi vidhayak rahi hai
 The Congress party is part of the Grand Alliance government in Bihar
 iske baavjood vidhayak ke khilaaf karrwai par koi kotahi nahin he
 SHO of Shikarpur police station Vinod Kumar Singh said that all efforts are being made to arrest the MLA
 halaki unke awaas par kai baar chhapemari ke baavjood ek bottle sharaab bhi baraamad nahin hui he
 Superintendent of the Department of Excise and Prohibition, who filed an FIR in the case, Rakesh Kumar said that the MLA did not cooperate in the investigation
 unhen poochtacha ke liye thane bulaayaa gaya lekin wo vahaan se chale gaye
 So the matter became more serious and an FIR had to be lodged against him
 aparaadh main hui kami is ghatana ne purebihar main sarkaar ke sharabbandiki muhim ko ek massej diya he
 If Raja or Ranka go against the prohibition of liquor law, then you will have to go to jail
 isamen jamaanat bhi nahin milti
 If we look at the statistics of Shikarpur police station, 41 firs were registered in April 2015
 lekin 2016 ke april maheene main keval 30 maamle darj hue hai
 Of these, 11 cases are under prohibition law
 ab isse puure bihar ke darj maamalon kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki aparaadh main kitni kami ai he
 The government had initially stated that there has been a 27 percent reduction in crime due to prohibition of alcohol
 yah aankada or bad saktaa he
 The police also got relief for the police
 Prior to the imprisonment, the time of crime was from 6 pm to 10 pm
 log sharaab pikar marpet or danga fansaad karte the
 But now there is peace at the square intersection, where people used to gather up till late in the night and make fun of it and go inside the house as soon as the evening is over
 chowk chauraaho par dukaane to khuli rahati hai lekin khariddaar bahut kam dikhaai dete hai
 Even in Patna, the roads are almost empty after 9 o'clock
 isse police ko bhi raahat mili he
 7 big businessmen are facing jail because of the special arrangement of drinking liquor for the guests who came to a wedding ceremony in room number 308 at Panash Hotel in Banipatipatna for drinking alcohol in hotels
 yahi nahin police ne hotel ke maalik ko bhi isamen aaropee bana diya he
 All such examples are enough to create fear in the people
 sharabbandi ke faisle se 100 fisadi mahilaayein khushhalaki iske baavjood bhi kahin-kahin se sharaab kii taskari kii soochna aa rahi he
 Due to the open boarder attached to Nepal, people come to drink in the areas adjacent to Nepal
 vahaan ke baar ab bihar ke logon se gulzaar ho rahe hai
 There is a business of serving liquor in many areas of Nepal
 vahiin se taskari bhi ho rahi he
 Similarly, the border of Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh is emerging as a new destination for alcoholics
 lekin in tamaam vishmataaon ke baavjood aam janata behad santusht he
 If women are happy with this decision of 100 percent government, then 90 percent men also believe that this is a good move
 sharabbandi ke said effectsharabbandi ke kai said effect bhi hai
 Meetings in large hotels are now decreasing
 sharabbandi se partyan par asar pad rahaa he
 Even the business of bone doctors has become tardy
 durghatnaon main kami ke kaaran ab marijon main bhi kami hui he
 Because of the number of nursing homes in Patna bypass, similar patients used to reach there
 achaanak hui rajya main purna sharabbandi lagusarkaar ne 1 april se desi sharaab main pabandi lagaai thi or videshi sharaab ke liye sarkaar khud unka outlet khol rahi thi
 But in many places people opposed this government shop of foreign liquor and did not allow the shop to open
 tab sarkaar ne 5 april ko rajya main purna sharabbandi lagu kar di
 This sudden arrest without giving time to anyone did not even give people a chance to destroy the liquor kept in their homes
 bihar ke hotel or baar restaurant ko do din pehle hi ek saal sharaab parosane kaa license mila tha
 But his business was devastated by the sudden government decision
 halaki sarkaar ne unke license fees lautaane kii baat kahi he
 But those who spent on infrastructure are protesting by registering a case against the government in Patna High Court
 3 may ko is maamle kii sunwaayee main hoicourt kaa kya faisla aata he ye dekhnaa mahatvapurn hoga
 How serious the government is regarding the prohibition of alcohol can be gauged from the fact that between April 1 and April 30, the police raided 19010
 jisamen 939 cese sharabbandi kanoon kaa ulanghan karne waalon par darj hue
 In this case, 1291 people have been sent to jail so far
 vidhayak or bade vyapaariyon par bhi kotahi kaa koi manjar nahin dikhaai diya
 In such a situation, the public will be scared of this prohibition law
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kai baar kuch aisa kar guzarate hai jo unki shakhsiyat par sawalia nishaan khadaa kar detaa he
 Generally speaking, it is common for the leaders to slip their speech during the speech, but it is imperative to wipe the tongue of the top men of politics
 fisali hui jubaan se niklaa shabd aksar samachar ban jaataa he
 The same happened with Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 rahul gandhi ne shuukravaar ko raipur main dhuandhar bhaashan diya
 During this time, he targeted the BJP government, Prime Minister Modi and the state CM
 unhone aakraamak style main bhaashan dekar bijepi ko sakate main daal diya
 Kirahulbaba, sitting as a political pundit, has burnt the assembly elections, but as time passed, the bjp's political corridor also started heating up
 bijepi kheme ne rahul gandhi ke bhaashan se achaanak ek aisa vaakya khoj nikaala jo rahul gandhi kii general nolej par sawaal khadaa karne ke liye kaaphi he
 Rahul asked the BJP government why he did not buy from BHEL mobilerahul Gandhi, in his style, attacked the BJP, Prime Minister Modi and Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh on one after the other issues
 aakhir main unhone aise mudde ko chhedaa jo ab unke gale kii fans banataa ja rahaa he
 Taking a dig at Chief Minister Raman Singh's smart phone plan, Rahul Gandhi asked why he did not buy the cell phone from BHEL
 ek nahin do baar rahul gandhi ne mobile kharidi ke liye BHEL kaa naam liya
 He said that Rafael scam on one side and cell phone scam on this side
 is bayaan ke baad rahul gandhi bijepi hi nahin balki aam votaron ke nishane par aa gaye hai
 He is being trolled on social media for his statement
 congress ke kai kaaryakarta bhi rahul ke is bayaan par unhen tanj kas rahe hai
 On the other hand, sitting on the BJP and Rahul Gandhi has put a big issue
 darasal, BHEL baari mashinari banaata he naa kii cell phone
 Rahul Gandhi, bjp's national spokesperson Sambit Patra, trolled over his statement, said on Rahul Gandhi's BHEL statement that this political understanding is that of a politician who dreams of becoming Prime Minister
 mukhyamantri raman singh ne bhi rahul gandhi ke bare main kaha ki naa to unhen raajnneeti kii samaj he or naa hi desh ke bare main koi gyaan he
 Former state chief minister Ajit Jogi taunted, saying that Kirahul says to curb parachute politics in Gandhi Party, but he himself has landed in Congress from parachute
 vahiin chhattisgarh bijepi pravaktaa shrichand sundarani ne kaha ki rahul gandhi naa to gambhir netaa hai or naa hi unki sakaaratmak soch he
 Without examining what anyone told them, those facts hit the public
 philhal cell phone kaa nirmaan na to BHEL karata he or naa hi beasenel
 On gathering information, it was found that both companies do not have any plans to manufacture cell phones in future
 aise main rahul gandhi kis BHEL company kaa zikr kar rahe the ye unheen ko pataa hoga
 At the moment, they are on target of their opponents with their slippery tongue
 bhaajapa adhyaksh rajnath singh ne somvaar ko jagadish shetter ko karnataka main 5 may ko hone ja rahe rajya vidhansabha ke chunaavon ke liye party kii ore se mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya
 At the same time, BJP has suspended two party mps for anti-party activities
 unhone yah ghoshnaa bhi kii ki party ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani or narendra modi karnataka ke chunaav main bhaajapa ke star prachaarak honge
 Singh, along with several party leaders, including Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley, left for Bengaluru today to start bjp's campaign in Karnataka, but the plane they were going through caused some flaws
 iske chalate vimaan kuch der kii udaan ke baad waapas laut aayaa

 com / glyxng9vdm turki main rus ke rajdoot kii hatya ko turki or rus ke netaaon ne uksaane vaali aatanki karrwai qaraar diya he
 On Monday in Ankara, Andre Karlov was shot by a Turkish police officer while he was giving a speech in an art gallery
 haalanki is ghatana ke baad hamalavar ko bhi dher kar diya gaya
 But the murder of an ambassador by a police officer in this way has shocked people all over the world
 sabake jehan main sawaal uth rahaa he ki aakhir rajdoot kii hatya kyon hui
 
 
 The first thing to note is that this incident happened at a time when the relationship between Russia and Turkey is improving and cooperation between the two countries is increasing
 donon deshon ke netaaon ne is baat par jor diya he ki is ghatana kaa saaya turki or rus kii dosti par nahin padani chahie
 Russia is supporting the government of President Bashar al-assad in the ongoing civil war in Syria
 ise lekar turki or rus ke bich tanaav bana hua he
 Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that this incident of murder is provocative action
 iskaa makasad rus or turki ke saamaanya hote rishton or syria main rus, turki, iran or anya deshon kii ore se kii ja rahi shanti bahaali kii prakriya main baadha daalana he
 Protests have also taken place outside Russia's consulate in Istanbul against Russia to support the Syrian government
 lekin turki or rus kii sarkarein aleppo main yuddh viraam par milakar kaam kar rahi hai
 Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said in the tone of Bhiputin that the purpose of the murder is to disrupt the normal relations between Turkey and Russia
 lekin rus or turki kii sarkarein is uksaane vaali karrwai kii sajeesh ko acchhee tarah samajhati hai
 a video of the incident is circulating on social media in which the attacker can be heard chanting 'allahu Akbar', 'don't forget Syria', 'don't forget Aleppo' after the Russian ambassador was shot
 gaur karne vaali baat he ki rus aleppo ke purvi hisse par asad sarkaar ko phir se kabja dilaane ke liye purajor koshish kar rahaa he
 The rebels have been occupied here for nearly four years
 iske alaava rus asad sarkaar kaa sabase shaktishaalee sahyogi he or sitambar 2015 se syria main tamaam ilaakon main hawaii hamale kar rahaa he jisase asad sarkaar ko majboot kiya ja sake
 As a permanent member of the Security Council of the United Nations, he has also used his veto power to try to politically resolve the ongoing war in Syria
 roosi rajdoot kii hatya aise samay hui he jab mangalvaar ko moscow main turki, iran or rus ke diplomats ek meeting karne vaale hai
 The present situation of Aleppo city is to be discussed in this meeting
 maare gaye rajdoot andre carlov putin ke pasandida rahe hai
 He lived with Putin during the Russian President's middle-east visit
 beete kuch varshon se rus madhya-purv main ek baar bhi prabhavi hone kii koshish main laga hua he
 Karlov played a key role in these efforts
 syria ko samarthan dene ke baad se rus or turki ke rishton main talkhi aani shuru ho gai thi
 Turkey is supporting the rebels fighting against Assad in Syria
 aise main lagata he ki hamalavar us samaaj kaa hissaa ho saktaa he jo syria main rus kii karrwai se naaraaz he
 Earlier last year, Turkey killed a Russian fighter plane in its airspace

 At the time, Delhi's chief secretary was summoned to the house of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and beaten by Aam Aadmi Party mlas
 maakan ne kaha ki kejariwal kaa uparajyapal ke ghar dharna uparajyapal kii mili bhagat se kiya gaya tha, kyonki dharne kaa drama donon bhaajapa or aam aadmi party ke liye phydemand tha

 The Reserve Bank of India has introduced a new proposal regarding bank accounts
 RBI ke is nae prastaav ke mutabik ab bina khaataa number badale ab log apana bank badal sakenge
 If this proposal is passed, bank account portability will also be possible after mobile number portability
 saaf he ki sabhi bank khaaton keadhar cardse link hone ke baad ab yah sambhav he ki khaaton ko ek bank se duusare bank main switch kiya ja sake
 Which can be quite a relief for bank account holders
 arabiai kaa kahana he ki haal hi ke daur main banking system main lagaataar technology kaa upyog badha he, jisase in chizon main kaaphi aasaani ai he
 This is why, like mobile number portability, bank accounts can also be made portable
 is portability se phaaydayadi aap apane bank se asantusht hai, uske dwaara di ja rahi sevaaon se pareshaan hai to bina apana bank acount number badale aap bank badal sakate hai
 So, now you do not have to get a new account number if you change your bank account repeatedly
 bank acount portbility ke baad aap ek se adhik bank acount number kii samasya se bhi mukt ho sakate hai
 After this facility, banks will be under pressure to improve the facility being given to customers or else the customer can go to another bank with his bank account
 kya bank honge portability ke liye taiyarbank acount number ko portability dena aasaan kaam nahin hoga
 To move in this direction, banks will have to move towards technology integration while online their data
 sambhav he ki iske liye bainkon ko apane khataadharakon ko unic bank acount dene kii maujuuda prakriya main bada pherbadal karnaa pad saktaa he
 i am alive and live in a society
 maan-bahan, beti kii ijjat par baat aayegi to sadak par utarkar samaaj main jaagrukta bhi failaaunga or beti virdohi balaatkaareeyon kaa samarthan karne vaale nitish chachaa ko bhi satta se ukhaadunga

 It can also be said that they seem misfit somewhere in this role, the direction of 'de De Pyaar De' is very weak and the story is also derailed

 ke shridhar reddy par ek mahila adhikari ko dhamkaane kaa aarope he

 The MLA abused my mother
 usne (vidhayak) mujhase kaha ki jab tak uskaa kaam puraa nahin ho jaataa, hamen bijli, pani or cabel conection nahin milegaa
 Taking the matter seriously, Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy ordered Director General of Police Gautam Savanga to take strict action against the accused and said that strict legal action will be taken against the accused if evidence of the mistake is found

 In the light of recent talks between India and Pakistan between the Home Ministers, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh hoped to develop a peaceful relationship with Pakistan but made it clear that India will also verify to what extent with anti-india terrorist organizations Has been settled
 apni sarkaar kaa bahut hi sadha hua drushtikon pradarshit karte hue singh ne kaha ki keval samay batayega ki pakistan ke saath sambandh ke sandarbh main ghatnakram kya karavat lete hai
 Returning from the G20 summit in Toronto, Singh said in a conversation with the journalists who accompanied him, "the Home Minister (P Chidambaram) was in Pakistan last week
 aapane yah jarur hi padhaa hoga ki unhone vahaan kya kaha
 i think there is some hope

 It is noteworthy that Chidambaram held talks with Pakistani counterpart Rahman Malik in Islamabad on 25 June and stressed the 'visible' result on the action on terrorism centered against India and asked to ensure that Mumbai was responsible for the attack
 People should be punished
 chidambaram ne baatcheet ke dauraan mumbai hamale main shaamil khaskar jamaat ud dawa pramukh hafiz said, sena ke do mejaron tathaa anya logon kaa zikr kiya tha jiske khilaaf bharat turant karrwai chahta he

 isliye keval samay hi batayega ki oont kya karavat letaa he

 ' ye shabd ek baar nahin balki kai baar court ke us kamare main sunai die, jahaan nyaayadhish kii kursi par baithi ek jaj sahiba ek maamle main faisla sunaane vaali thi
 She was pleading with the court that a daughter was not for anyone else but for her real mother
 aisa vaakya shaayad hi aapane pehle kabhi suna hoga
 But this is a fact in Bhagalpur, Bihar, where a daughter was demanding the execution of her strict mother not for her release from the court, but for her harsh punishment
 jaj sahiba ne ek beti ke dard ko mahasoos karte hue sajaa to sunai lekin faansee kii nahin balki umr kaid kii
 a daughter pleading for death sentence from the court was not satisfied with the decision of Judge Sahiba and she kept on talking about knocking the door of the upper court in protest against this decision
 pyaar ke liye bacchon kii parvaah tak nahin kidansal ye kahani he ek aise parivaar kii jisamen ek mahila ne apnepremi ke sahyog se apane pati kii hatya kar di
 The lady Baby Devi and her husband Ramanand Ram lived in a rented house in Bhagalpur with their two children Neelu and Ritesh
 baby devi or ramanand ram bhagalpur ke hi ek nijee skool main kaam kar apane parivaar kaa paalan poshan karte the
 While working, Baby met Manikant Yadav, working as a driver in school
 donon main pehle baatcheet or phir dhire-dhire milane-julne kaa silsilaa shuru hua
 Both of them again fell in love
 do bachche kii maa apane pati ko dhokhe main rakhkar ek driver ke pyaar main is tarah pagal hui ki use apane parivaar or bacchon tak kii parvaah nahin rahi
 The murder of the husband becoming a snag was on his loved one
 ab donon ne milakar pyaar ke raste main roda ban rahe ramanand ram ko hi hataane kii yojana bana daali
 Then on 15 February 2012 as part of the plan, Baby and Manikant Yadav killed Ramanand Ram and threw his corpse into a well
 23 farvari 2012 ko ramanand kii laash kuen se baraamad kii gai
 Based on the statement of the deceased Ramanand's father Kumud Ram, daughter Neelu and son Ritesh after the body was found, a case was filed against Baby Devi and Manikant Yadav as accused
 police dwaara giraftaar kiye jane par baby ne apana jurm kabool bhi kiya

 Construction of this bridge has started rapidly

 The construction of BRTS started on September 2013 but due to various constraints, the project was not completed
 kai sthanon par sadak ko chaudaa karne kii jarurat thi or iske liye atikaraman bhi hataae gaye
 But the biggest difficulty came in the sand ghat, where there was a need to remove the one and a half year old Burj Masjid, which was objected to by a section of the society
 aise main sarkaar ke saamne shahar ke sampradayik sauhaard ko banaae rakhte hue vikaas ko raftaar dene kii chunauti thi
 To maintain the existence of this mosque, the Muslim sect lodged a protest in the Collector and the Municipal Corporation and also approached the Waqf Tribunal from where it got a stay in the matter
 iske baad vibhinn pakshon kii kai daur kii baatcheet hui or aakhirkaar bich kaa aisa rasta nikal hi gaya jo sabhi ko manjuur tha

 This bridge will connect the old city with the new city
 nagareey prashasan ayukta sanjay shukla kehete hai, ''shahar ko brij kii jarurat thi or sabhi pakshon ke sahyog se ise banaaya ja rahaa he
 It will add beauty to the beauty of the city
 ''haal-philhal ek ke baad ek kai sampradayik ghatnaon kaa gavaah ban chukaa pradesh ab ek or ghaav nahin sahanaa chahta tha
 In such a situation, the government showed special interest in finding a middle ground
 nagareey prashasan mantri kailash vijayawargeey bataate hai, ''hamane is samasya kaa aisa rasta nikaala he jis par ab kisi ko bhi aapatti nahin he
 The advantage is that the speed of the city will not be affected during the construction of the bridge
 hamaari manshaa sab ko saath lekar chalane kii rahi he
 Therefore, we do not want to offend any party on the issue of development
 ''masjid ko hataane kaa virodh kar rahe sanghathan bhi brij nirmaan ke nirnay se khush hai
 Masood Ahmad Khan, secretary of the Madhya Pradesh unit of the Co-ordination Committee for Indian Muslims, says, "we are not against the development work going on in the city
 hamaari koshish lagbhag 150 saal puraani us masjid ko bachaane kii he jiskaa aitihaasik mahatv bhi he
 The administration could also widen the way by removing the houses on the other side of the mosque, yet there was talk of removing the mosque
 isi baat par hamaara virodh tha
 Quoting Masood Ahmad Khan Places of Worship (special Provisions) Act-1991, states that most of the mosques in Bhopal are pre-independence and this law prohibits the conversion of any place of worship to another form and Ensuring that religious form was there on August 15, 1947

 CTET Result 2019 copenhegan sammelan se pehle china ne aaj bharat ke is ruukh kaa samarthan kiya ki vikasshil deshon ke liye utsarjan main katautee ke lakshya badhyakaari nahin hai or kaha ki vah jalwaayu parivartan ke ‘shikaar’ donon deshon ke bich ‘sahyog or samanvay’ ko vistaar dene ko taiyaar he
 "we understand India's current stance," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shin Gang told reporters here
 hamen hamaari rashtriya sthitiyon or kshamtaaon ke aadhaar par anukulan or katautee karnaa hogi
 He said that China is ready to strengthen 'contact, coordination and cooperation' with India on the issue of climate change
 gang ne kaha, ‘‘china or bharat vikasshil desh hai or jalwaayu parivartan ke shikaar hai
 He said that both sides are not bound to set binding targets of emission reductions
 bharat ne utsarjan main badhyakaari katautee karne se inkaar kar kaha he ki aisa karne se uski aarthik pragati dhimi ho jaayegi
 Instead, it has chosen to voluntarily take steps to cut emissions
 paryaavaran mantri jairam ramesh ne kal nayi dilli main kaha tha ki vikasshil deshon ke swechha main uthaaye gayi kadam antarrashtriya nigaraanee, report or satyaapan ke daayre main honge
 It was agreed that these steps would be taken on getting international help
 vishwa netaa saat se 18 disambar ke bich copenhegan main jalwaayu parivartan par baatcheet karne kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 Unlike India, China announced its targets last week, saying it would cut emissions per unit of GDP by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020 compared to 2005 levels
 gang kii yah tippanee china, bharat, brazil or dakshin africa ke bich beijing main gat november hui baithak ke baad aayi he jisamen copenhegan sammelan main sahyog karne or ek saajha ruukh banane kaa faisla kiya gaya tha
 a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry said that climate change has been caused by the massive emissions of industrialization of developed countries of the West
 unhone kaha, ‘‘lihaaja, china or anya viksit deshon ke bich hit, chintaaen, apilen saajha hai or jalwaayu parivartan par unka ruukh samaan he

 aachaar samhita lagu hone ke baavjood pradhanmantri modi or bijepi ke prachaar main dikh rahe is channel ko lekar vipaksh sawaal uthaa rahaa he
 He says how can DTH service providers broadcast Namo TV during election campaign? If the government has information about it, why has it not been closed so far? How can such a channel run without the permission of the government? BJP is openly promoting Namo TV? When asked about this, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that the department concerned would clear the government's stand on it
 udhar sarkari sutron kaa daawa he ki namo tivi koi saamaanya tivi channel nahin he
 Namo TV is running as an advertising platform on DTH
 haalanki soochna prasaaran mantralay se manzuri praapt channelon kii list main yah channel shaamil nahin he
 The permission of Ministry of Information Broadcasting is not required to run such advertising platforms
 sarkari sutron kaa kahana he ki namo tivi kaanoon ke jhol kaa phayda uthaakar chalaaya ja rahaa he
 But then why is the BJP promoting it officially? And why is the government not taking action on this? The Congress has targeted the Election Commission to take action in this matter, targeting PM Modi

 In fact, there were reports that a meeting between Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia and Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi was canceled on Tuesday

 It was being claimed that Sonia Gandhi, the interim president of the Congress, wanted to resolve the dispute between the leaders as soon as possible

 Recently, Kamal Nath was called to 10 Janpath after Scindia threatened to leave the party, where Gandhi raised disciplinary issues in the state Congress

 The political winds of West Bengal are changing very much these days
 ab TMC supremeo mamata banerjee ne kaha he ki agar modi sarkaar janata kii bhalaai ke liye kaam kare, to unki party NDA sarkaar ko samarthan de sakati he
 Bardhaman blast due to chit fund money: Amit Shahmata Banerjee also admitted that Modi government is going in the right direction
 mamata ne kaha ki agar sarkaar thik tarah se samaaj ke sabhi virgon ke hit main kaam karti he, to TMC centre ko apana puraa samarthan degi
 Didi has only laid down the condition that work should be 'constructive' and should be for all classes
 baharhaal, mamata banerjee ne modi sarkaar kii ore samarthan kaa pasa aise vakt phenkaa he, jab loksabhaa main use sankhya-bal ke hisaab se kisi party ke samarthan kii darkaar hi nahin he
 As far as Rajya Sabha is concerned, TMC mps can prove to be very helpful by giving support when a bill is passed
 khud piem narendra modi sansad main yah kah chuke hai ki unki sarkaar sabhi dalon ko saath lekar chalane kaa iraadaa rakhti he, chaahe vah party badi ho yaa choti
 Mamta Banerjee's latest statement has come at a time when TMC was seen strongly opposing the central government on many issues
 bijepi ke virodh or mulaayam singh yadav kii aguwai main banane ja rahi kathith 'samaajawaadee janata party' main bhi mamata ko shaamil kiye jane kii koshishen ho rahi thim
 Now Mamata Banerjee's 'u-turn' can change the stance of political wind
 jahaan tak bijepi kii baat he, vah in dinon mamata banerjee ke garh main jaakar prachaar-prasar karne main juty hui he
 Party president Amit Shah himself has taken over the front
 itnaa hi nahin, khud mamata banerjee or unki party tak chitfund ghotaale kii tapish pahunchati dikh rahi he
 In such a situation, it will be seen what Mamta's fresh attitude brings political color in the coming days

 siem yogi kii jubaan jiske chalate band karai gai he, use hi unhone apana hathiyaar bana liya he
 Yogi Adityanath has devised a strategy to better use the Election Commission's three-day ban

 On Tuesday, the first day of the Election Commission's ban, Yogi recited Hanuman Chalisa at the Hanuman temple in Lucknow
 iske baad bain ke duusare din yogi buudhvaar ko ayodhya ke hanumangadhi main darshan karne pahunch gaye
 Not only this, on the third day of the ban, he has made a strategy to visit Kashi Vishwanath temple and Sankatmochan in Banaras
 bataa den ki pratibandh kii vajah se yogi naa to raily kar sakate hai, naa raajnneetik baithak or naa chunaav se judi koi bayaanbaji kar sakate hai
 The Election Commission has also banned him from using social media
 isi ke chalate yogi ne aisa tarika talasha he, jis par agar chunaav ayog roak lagaati he to bijepi ko or bhi raajnneetik phayda mil saktaa he
 After the ban of the Election Commission, Yogi is completely seen in the shelter of Bajrang Bali
 lakhanu or ayodhya ke baad yogi guuruuvaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi kii sansadeey seat varanasi pahunch rahe hai
 Yogis will offer prayers at Sankatmochan temple after seeing Kashi Vishwanath in Benares

 Sasikala has also demanded an ordinance in this regard
 shashikala ne jalikattu masale ko bahut hi mahatvapurn or jaruri bataaya he
 Apart from this, he has also sought Modi's 'sober thoughts' on this issue so that necessary arrangements and action can be taken for Jallikattu
 annadramuk lagaataar is masale par centre sarkaar sejallikattuko lagu karne ke liye apil kar rahi he
 State Chief Minister Panneerselvam has also appealed to PM Modi in this regard
 shashikala ne modi ko patr likhakar kaha he, pashuon ke saath kisi tarah kii krurta nahin kii jaati
 In Tamil Nadu, the bull is worshiped as a deity and the youth who tries to control them take care that they do not have any kind of pain
 unhone kaha ki jallikattu par pratibandh se tamilnadu ke logon main rosh badha he or khaskar yuvaaon main
 All efforts should be made to eliminate it
 rajya paryaavaran mantri anil dave ne nivedan kiya he ki is saal is paramparaagat khel ke yojit karne kii anumati di jaae
 AIDMK mps have also met him on this issue
 vahiin annadramuk ke hi em thambidurai ne kaha ki sarkaar isaki parampara ko dekhne ke liye kuch adhyadesh laa sakati he
 If you run with the only judiciary in a democracy, then that is not the solution
 meri darkhwaast he ki is saal jallikattu ko nirvirodh chalane diya jaae
 Actress and Congress spokesperson Khushboo Sundar attacked AIDMK and BJP, saying that Jallikattu has not been happening since 2015
 kyon pichley do saal main is par kuch nahin kiya gaya? ve keval pongal ke paas aane par kyon is maamle ko uthaa rahe hai? annadramuk or bijepi logon ko gumraah kar rahe hai
 Both parties are playing with the feelings of the people of Tamil Nadu
 khushboo ne kaha ki sirf ek sanshodhan kar pratibandh hataaya ja saktaa he, jo ki sansad main hoga
 But when Pongal comes closer, he is showing off
 nishchit rup se jallikattu par pratibandh samaapt kiya janaa chahie
 We can operate Jallikattu under the rules

 a special bull race is organized on the occasion of Pongal
 pongal ke tyohaar main mukhya rup se bail kii puja kii jaati he kyonki bail ke madhyam se kisaan apni jameen jotata he
 Due to this bull race is organized
 is samaaroh ko jallikattu pratha naam se jaanate hai
 According to the data, between 2010 and 2014, 17 people died while playing Jallikattu and more than 1,100 were injured
 vahiin pichley 20 saalon main jallikattu kii vajah se marane waalon kii sankhya 200 se bhi zyada thi
 Because of this, in 2014, the game was banned by the Supreme Court under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act
 ye thi court kii tippaneesupreme court ne kaha tha ki jallikattu ke mahaj sadiyon puraani pratha hone ke kaaran ise uchit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 Since Jallikattu is centuries old, it cannot be said that it is legally or legally permissible
 jallikattu par bain ko jaij tehraane ke liye court ne balvivaah kii baat bhi kahi thi
 The court had said that children under the age of 12 were married for centuries
 kya iskaa yah matlab he ki bal vivaah kanoonee he? court ne jalikattu par tippanee karte hue kaha tha ki jalikattu ko kya ijaajat de deni chahie bhale hi wo 5000 saal puraani parampara ho or kanoon ke daayre se baahar ho

 ) mahadev ke vishalkay dwarpal shakti or bhakthi kii wo murat hai, jinaki ajna ke bina mahadev ke darshan nahin hote
 a 15-foot giant Nandi is present in the Big Bull temple
 mandir main pravesh karte hi bhakton kii nigahen us vishalkay pratimaa ko ekatak niharti hi rah jaati hai
 Nandi is the gatekeeper of Bhole, without whose desire the doors of devotion would not open
 nandi kii marji ke bina shiv-shankar kisi se nahin milte
 This is the reason why his idol remains outside every Shiva temple and devotees enter the Shiva temple only after seeing them
 nandi bhakthi or shakti kaa pratik hai or shakti kaa ek aisa hi vishaal swaroop dekhne ko miltaa he big bul mandir main
 There is a Big Bull temple on the Bull Temple Road in Basavanagudi, Bangalore, where devotees have their eyes wide open upon entering
 yahaan pravesh karte hi nandi kii vishalkay pratimaa mahadev ke bhakton kaa swaagat karti he or bhole bhandari ke bhakton kii guhaar un tak pahunchaati he
 Although Nandi resides outside every temple of Mahadev and devotees enter the temple only with his permission, but Big Bull temple has the same black colored statue of Nandi of the same stone, which is 15 feet
 It is tall and about 20 feet wide and is a center of special attraction for devotees coming from far and wide
 big bul mandir ke naam par hi is ilaake kaa naam basavangudi padaa he, kyonki sthaneey bhashaa main baswan kaa arth bul or gudi kaa arth mandir hota he
 In Hinduism, the bull is seen to be associated with Nandi, due to which the temple was named Big Bull
 manyata he ki solahavin shatabdi main bane is mandir kii sthapana bangalore ke sansthaapak kempi gaunda ne kii thi
 This temple has unique method of worship and adornment, Nandi is anointed with butter
 kehete hai is shringaar main kareeb 100 kilo makkhan kaa istemaal hota he, jiske darshan kar bhakt nihaal ho uthte hai
 The temple is opened for common devotees at 6 am in the morning and remains open till 8 pm
 kehete hai yahaan jo bhi aata he wo khaali haath kabhi nahin lautataa
 Mahadev makes bad works and brings joy to the devotees
 tabhi to nandi sang shiv ke is manohari rup ke darshan ke liye bhakton kii bheed umad padati he
 There is also a story behind the name of this temple as Big Bull
 mahadev ek baar jise gale laga lete hai uskaa saath kabhi nahin chhodte
 On which the blessing of the witch-bearer becomes immortal
 shiv ke parambhakt, unke vaahan nandi ke saath bhi kuch aisa hi he, tabhi to koi bhi shivala ho yaa phir koi mandir, har jagah nandi, shiv parivaar ke sang jarur najar aate hai
 But a different story of Nandi's devotion and his power is seen and heard in the Big Bull temple
 is mandir kii sthapana ke peeche ek puranic manyata he
 It is said that several hundred years ago, a large number of coconuts were cultivated around this temple
 lekin ek baar ek junglee bail ne puure ilaake main haahaakaar machaa diya, usne kheton main ghuskar nariyal kii puri kheti barabaad kar di
 Then an angry farmer attacked him with a pole and a miracle happened and the bull turned into a black stone statue
 sthaneey logon kaa kahana he ki kaale rang kii pratimaa main bail kaa aakaar lagaataar badhata hi ja rahaa tha, tab uske badhate hue aakaar ko rokane ke liye mahadev ke praturup main trishul ko bail ke maathe main sthapit kiya gaya, jisase bail kaa aakaar badhanaa ruk gaya
 It was here that Kempi Gounda established the Shivling and got the temple constructed
 is mandir kii sthapana ke saath hi yahaan nariyal chadhaane kii parampara shuru hui jo aaj bhi apane mul rup main usee tarah nibhaai ja rahi he
 The coconut fair is organized here every year in the month of november-december when big coconut shops are decorated on both sides of the road outside the temple
 aam bhashaa main is meley ko kadalkavi parishae kaha jaataa he
