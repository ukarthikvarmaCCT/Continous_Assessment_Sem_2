 During this, he responded in a frank manner on national and international issues
 unhone pakistan, aatankwaad, sargical strike or air strike samet kai muddon par apni baat rakhi
 When PM Modi was asked that despite Pakistan surgical strike and air strike, why is the hawk not coming back from its antics? How will Pakistan improve? On this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that after the Uri terror attack, the Indian Army entered Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and carried out a surgical strike
 iske baad jab jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main siarpief ke kafile par aatanki hamalaa hua, to bhartiya vayusena ne pakistan ke balakot main ghuskar air strike kii
 He said, 'with these steps of India, the discussion about terrorism in Pakistan has started
 hamaari vajah se pakistan ke log vahaan kii sarkaar par dabaav daal rahe hai
 The people there are saying that why the Pakistan government has kept these terrorists? Protection of terrorists should stop for the bright future of Pakistan
 pakistan media bhi kah rahaa he ki aakhir pakistan ko kya ho gaya, jo vah aatankiyon ko paal rahaa he?'piem modi ne kaha, 'main chaahe jitne bhaashan de duun, lekin duniya ke gale nahin utarati he
 When we go to Pakistan and kill the terrorists, Pakistan is unable to speak nor deny it
 haalanki apane logon ko bataane ke liye pakistan sarkaar kah rahi he ki kuch nahin hua he
 The Prime Minister questioned whether Pakistan would be ready to accept the surgical strike and air strike? During this time PM Modi targeted those who questioned the surgical strike and air strike
 unhone kaha ki hamaare desh ke think tanks ko samasya samaj hi nahin aati he
 They do not understand how the issue related to Pakistan should be looked at? PM Modi said that this is not a municipal corporation election, it is an election of the country
 is chunaav main desh bhi he, seemaa bhi he or aatankwaad bhi he
 No one can hide from these issues
 unhone kaha ki is chunaav main rashtriya suraksha par bhi charchaa honi chahie

 Lutyens once decorated parts of Delhi
 lekin samay ke saath sikh lene kii taasir dilli ke hukmaranon main shaayad kabhi nahin rahi
 This is the reason that the changed roads in the pond of delhi-ncr are the result of poor drainage system
 alam yah he ki haive se lekar fliover par tagada jam laga he
 Drainage capacity has come down by 30 per cent
 Currently, waterlogging is a major challenge for the city, which needs to be strengthened on a large scale
 dilli-ensiaar ke bigadate drenez system par 'aaj tak' ne shahar ke jane maane toun planar eke jain se khaas baatcheet kii he
 He told, 'delhi's drainage system is 70 years old
 tab 20 lakh aabaadi hua karti thi
 Today the population is around 20 million
 jahaan drenez kii kshamta 30 fisadi badhani chahie thi, wo 30 fisadi ghat gai he
 "increased problems due to irregular colonies," AK Jain, citing the reasons for the drainage system to be weak, says, "many drains of the city are full
" shaharikaran hua, aniyamit coloniyaan banaai gayi or is kaaran bhi drenez barbaad ho gaye
 The garbage going in the drainage is not being cleaned
 yamuna nadi main wazirabad or noida kaa dren girtaa he
 Around 30 percent of the area has been constructed
 kai colony ban chuki he
 Whether it is Akshardham, Millennium Depot or Delhi Secretariat
 achaanak hue is nirmaan se yamuna nadi kii drenez kshamta kam ho gai he
 'the plan was made, but it did not work
 In the last decade, there has been such rapid development in Gurgaon, Noida and Delhi that the government and agencies forgot to plan the city's drainage system
 eke jain kehete hai, 'drenez system ko majboot karne ke liye koi plan taiyaar nahin kiya gaya he
 In such a situation, there is a need to make a central plan
 aisa ek plan 10 saal pehle bana tha, lekin us par kaam nahin hua
 'need to form a high-level committee to control traffic and drainage in Delhi, a ring road should be built, with a road between kondli-manesar-palwal and faridabad-noida-gurgaon
 lekin sarkaar ne ise thande baste main daal diya gaya
 Jain says that property value in Delhi has increased
 is vajah se dilers kii najar khaali jameen par zyada rahati he
 This is also one of the reasons that the construction of irregular colonies in the Yamuna belt of Delhi has increased
 jain ne suzav diya ki dilli main ek nagar nigam, DDA or dilli sarkaar ke bich hipawar cameti banani chahie, jo drenez system par kaam kare
 There were 600 water bodies, now only 150 left, according to the town planner, Delhi is in the Danger Zone
 unka kahana he ki dilli main 600 water body hoti thim, jo ab 150 rah gai hai
 After the rain, the water stops at one place due to the Wazirabad barrage, otherwise Delhi may be completely submerged

 ) sargical strike ko lekar siyasat tej ho gai he
 PM Narendra Modi has taunted the Congress claim
 rajasthan ke sikar main raily ko sambodhit karte hue piem modi ne kaha ki asi kamaron main baithkar kaagaj main sargical strike congress hi kar sakati he
 First he said that we did a surgical strike 3 times, yesterday we said we did 6 times
 ab kuch din main kah denge ki hamane har roj strike kii
 PM Modi said that yesterday a senior Congress leader gave a statement that in our time too many surgical strikes occurred
 ab congress kisi bhi tarah ye sabit karne main tuli he ki hamane air strike kii
 Congressmen have now also revealed the date of the surgical strike
 ye kisi strike thi bhai, jiske bare main aatankiyon ko kuch nahin pataa, strike karne waalon ko kuch nahin pataa, pakistan ko kuch nahin pataa or na desh kii janata ko kuch pataa he
 Taking a dig at the Congress, PM Modi said, "I think there are people in the Congress who keep playing video games at any stage of their age and may even enjoy surgical strikes as video games
" congress karnataka main jo sarkaar chalaa rahi he, uske mukhyamantri ne bayaan diya ki sena main vahi log jate hai jinke paas 2 vakt kaa khaanaa nahin he, bhukhe marate hai, pet bharne ke liye sena main jate hai
 Is this an insult to our brave sons and their mothers or not? In Sikar, PM Modi said that the Congress's behavior towards the army and our martyrs has always been like this
 itane saal congress sarkaar rahi lekin inhone rashtriya war memorial nahin banwaaya
 This watchman had the privilege of building the National War Memorial after 7 decades of independence
 ye vahi congress party he jo chaar dashak tak sainikon ko van rank-van pension ke liye latakaati rahi, thukaraati rahi
 And when Modi said among the ex-servicemen that we will keep doing this, then we asked to throw dust in the eyes of the soldiers that we have implemented
 piem modi ne kaha ki congress ke man main kabhi desh kii raksha karne waalon ke liye sammaan nahin rahaa he
 Therefore, Congress never thought about their interests
 congress kaa panja hameshaa malai ke chakkar main rahata he
 Congress has never gone where there is no rubbing
 ye bhi ek vajah he ki congress ke aate hi mahangaai aasmaan chune lagati he
 That is, Congress came, brought inflation

 In 2014, there was a dispute between the two families and three people from the Rajput family were killed in the incident

 After this murder, Jitendra's family left the village in fear of retaliation
 jitendra kaa parivaar dedh maah pehle hi gaanv lautaa tha or uske baad yah vaardaat ho gai
 However, Jitendra's cousin Vijay explains the reason for the 2014 murder case, "the Rajput youth was not only sparring with Dalit women, but forcibly draining a Dalit youth while making racist remarks when his phone went down the drain
" Were getting the phone out
 " unka kahana he ki 2014 ke hatyakand main unke parivaar kaa haath nahin tha
 Jitendra alleges that the Rajputs were constantly threatening him by returning
 vahiin balavant kaa parivaar saaf inkaar karata he, ''is aagjanee main hamaara koi haath nahin he
 We ourselves are suffering, our people have been killed
 "bahujan samaaj party (bispi) ke netaa or sthaneey vidhayak tech chand sharma kehete hai, ''yah ghatana behad sharmnaak he

 adhiktar kathith oonchi jatiyon ke yahaan mazdooree karte hai yaa phir aasapaas kii companiyon main kaam karne lagate hai
 If they remain silent then fine, but as soon as they resist their atrocities or come into this quarrel, there is a reaction from the upper castes
 " bhagana se lekar sunped tak pratirodh kii yahi prakriya najar aati he
 Whether the case of Jat occupation of Dalits land in Bhagana or the alleged rape of Dalit girls, Dalits have demonstrated from the local level to Delhi
 rashtriya sharmadaliton ke khilaaf julm kaa aisa haal keval haryana main nahin he
 On May 14 this year at Dangawas in Nagaur district of Rajasthan, people of the Jat community crushed Dalits with a tractor over a dispute over possession of a Dalit's land

 Bihar CM Nitish Kumar said in Muzaffarpur in the wake of campaigning for the fourth round of assembly in the state, "tell the BJP, who scared the name of Jungle Raj in Bihar, whether it is Mangalraj to burn Dalit children in Haryana?" About two months ago, there was silence on the attack of the Bhumihar community on the Dalit colony in Khagaria of their state
 vahiin pradesh main ek-ek kar bheeshan dalit narsanhaaron ke aropiyon kaa bari hona bhi koi mudda nahin ban paata
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is trying hard to get the votes of Dalits in his side in Bihar, has not said anything yet on the bjp-ruled Haryana's Sunpeed scandal
 bispi pramukh mayawati ke nirdesh par sunped pahunche party ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh rajaraam ne haryana main dalit utpeeda ke khilaaf party kii ore se sangharsh chalaane kii baat kahi
 But the local Dalits raised their finger on the local BSP MLA and said, "tek Chand Sharma won from here due to the vote of the Dalits and they are now standing with the administration and BJP government instead of Dalits
 " rajaraam ne bhi is tathy ko sabake saamne kabool kiya or karrwai kaa aashwaasan diya
 So, the importance of Dalits is left only to get their votes? In the absence of justice in the misty Asbhagana case of justice, Dalits chose the path of conversion, then the accused of the Dalit massacres in Bihar are being left out due to lack of evidence
 aise main koi do raay nahin ki daliton ko insaaf milane kii aas dhundhlee hi najar aati he
 Even the administration is not clean
 sunped maamle main bhale hi saat aropiyon ko giraftaar kar liya gaya ho, par jitendra ke parivaar ko dar he ki police kahin use hi is maamle main na fansaa de
 Though Haryana DGP Yashpal says, "A CBI inquiry has been recommended in this case, so we have nothing to say on its investigation
" " lekin haryana main daliton ke khilaaf aparaadh ke 68 fisadi badaae kii baat poochne par ve enciarabi ke aankade par hi andeh jataa dete hai
 After Sunpeed and Gohana, now a Dalit in Hisar has committed suicide by accusing the police of excess

 lekin, aisi kai mahilaayein hoti hai jinke stanon main bachche ke janm ke baad bhi doodh nahin aata
 In such a situation, many times the question arises whether any other woman can breastfeed someone's child ? Let us tell you that breast-feeding another child is called weight-nursing
 lekin kya yah bachche ke liye surakshit he
 How safe is it to breastfeed a child with another woman? You must have heard from your grandmother or grandmother that they have breastfed someone else's child at home or relatives and both are perfectly healthy
 agar aapke stanon main doodh kii maatra bahut hi kam banati he yaa doodh hota hi nahin he, to aisi sthiti main wet-nursing kii madad le sakate hai
 How safe is weight-nursing? According to experts, it is not dangerous to breastfeed someone else's child
 lekin, yah puri tarah se surakshit bhi nahin he
 How safe it is for the baby depends on the health of the breastfeeding woman
 bahut-si kaamkaaji mahilaayein aaj ke samay main ek-duusare ke bachche ko brestfding karaati hai
 In many cases it has been found to be completely safe
 lekin kuch halaaton main kisi or se apane bachche ko brestfding karwaane se bachanaa chahie
 Keep these things in mind if a breastfeeding woman is a patient of serious illness, such as: HIV, cancer or any other health related problem, it can prove to be dangerous for the baby

 shivasena ne bijepi se todaa 30 saal purana gathbandhanendha se alag hokar bhi sarkaar nahin bana saki shivasenaudhav ne khud sonia gandhi or sharad pavaar se kii baat24 oktober ko maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey aae to har taraf 'phir ek baar bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan kii sarkaar' kii charchaa hui
 But in the evening of the results, Shiv Sena started eyeing
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne press conference main mukhyamantri kaa pad behad mahatvapurn bataate hue apane iraade jaahir kar die
 After this, there was continuous rhetoric on behalf of Shiv Sena citing 50-50 formulas
 shivasena kaa yah rukh dekh bijepi ne bhi do took kah diya ki jo formula tay hua tha usamen siem pad tha hi nahin
 This statement of Devendra Fadnavis has so much adored the Shiv Sena that today Governor's rule has come in Maharashtra
 is puure sangram main shivasena apana mukhyamantri hone kaa daawa karti rahi, lekin din-ba din fansati bhi gai
 The Shiv Sena first warned its ally BJP and raised the voice of dividing the chief minister's post for two-and-a-half years
 bijepi is baat par raji nahin hui to shivasena ne duusare vikalpon kaa zikr kar puri siyasat ko hi mode diya
 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut publicly stated that he had the support of 170 mlas
 ensipi or congress ke samarthan kii baat bhi khule taur par shivasena kii taraf se saamne aane lagi
 However, there was no formal interaction with the NCP and Congress on behalf of the Shiv Sena in this entire political drama
 lekin shivasena apane tevar dikhaati rahi
 As a result, the BJP fell alone
 rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari ne sabase badi party hone ke naate bijepi ko sarkaar kaa ofer diya, jiske baad ravivaar (10 november) shaam bijepi ne rajyapal ko suchit kar diya ki vah apane dam par sarkaar banane main sakasham nahin he or uske paas kisi or kaa samarthan nahin he
 After the bjp's refusal, the Governor made an offer to the Shiv Sena on the same day and asked him to submit the government's claim within 24 hours
 is ofer ko puraa karne ke liye shivasena ko ensipi or congress kaa samarthan jaruri tha
 Therefore, a round of negotiations and discussions began
 ensipi ne shart rakhi ki shivasena endie se baahar hoti he to vah samarthan par vichaar karegi
 Shiv Sena accepted this condition of NCP and on the next morning i

 The meetings continued till late in the evening, but no result was found and Shiv Sena could not present its claim, after which the Governor offered the government to NCP
 ensipi bhi samarthan patr dene ke bajaay rajyapal se vakt maangane lagi jiske baad rajyapal kii sifarish par raashtrapati shashan lagu ho gaya
 30-year-old relationship broken, compromised with ideology In this entire political tussle, the Shiv Sena has had to end its 30-year-old relationship
 to duusari taraf virdohi vichaardhaara vaali congress or ensipi se sahyog ke liye aage aana padaa he
 Uddhav Thackeray himself has spoken to Sonia Gandhi and called for support
 saath hi thakare ne ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ke saath bhi baithak kii
 Both these incidents were very different in the political history of Shiv Sena, but Uddhav Thackeray had to do so for damage control
 vichaardhaara par samjhauta kar chuki shivasena ke saamne sarkaar main hissedari bhi ek badi chunauti he
 There is news from NCP camp that she wants to share CM post with Shiv Sena for two-and-a-half years
 saath hi congress ke dipti siem or spikar kii bhi jaankaree saamne aa chuki he
 Apart from this, the sources also say that the Congress wants equal share of the three parties in the cabinet and equal distribution of important ministries
 bijepi kaa saath chhod chuki shivasena ko apni party kaa mukhyamantri hone kii khwaahish puri karne ke liye congress-ensipi kaa saath paanaa jaruri he
 It remains to be seen what conditions the Congress and NCP support the Shiv Sena and to what extent Uddhav Thackeray is able to compromise

 During the hearing of Chidambaram's bail plea, Kapil Sibal said in the High Court that even during the custody, the CBI did not find any such document to prove that it was a case of corruption
 chidambaram ke vakil or varisht congress netaa kapil sibbal ne court se kaha, 'sibiai daleel de rahi he ki chidambaram videsh bhaag sakate hai, chidambaram kahaan bhaag rahe hai? na hi koi saboot nasht kar sakate hai

 lekin secular bharatiyon ke man main gujarat 2002 loktantric raajnneeti par ek anarthakaari sadame kii tarah pabast he
 The conviction of Maya Kodnani, a minister in the Modi cabinet, in the Naroda Patia massacre case has refuted Modi's claim that the government was not involved in the 2002 Gujarat atrocities on Muslims
 naroda paatia maamle main aae faisle ne puraane jakhmon ko phir se kuredne kaa kaam kiya he ki aakhir mahatma gandhi kaa gujarat kyon, kaise or kab dharmik raajnneeti, sampradayik vibhaajan tathaa purvaniyojit hinsa ke rangamanch main tabdeel ho gaya?gandhi ne 20veen sadi ke purvarddh main apane rajnatik darshan kii paribhaasha ahimsa naam ke shabd se di thi
 Today it seems to us that non-violence is the philosophy given by Gandhi, but it has been present in Indian religious and philosophical thought tradition, especially in Jain and Buddhist philosophy, for two millennia
 gujarat ke abhijatya samaaj main jainiyon kii ahm maujuudagi kii vajah se gandhi kaa saakshaatkaar choti umr main hi ahimsa se ho gaya
 Ahimsa literally means "lack of desire to hurt others
" ’’ bharat ke swadhinata sangram kaa netritv haath main lekar unhone jain darshan main maujuud ahimsa ke siddhant ko lokapriy raajnneeti kaa hissaa banaaya
 For Gandhi, India's political goal was to achieve Swaraj, which was not only synonymous with freedom from foreign rule, but also to overcome the desire to harm others, also to overcome the violent tendencies within
 gandhivadi sangharsh main ahimsa or swaraj avichhin the
 This meant that true freedom could be achieved without ahimsa, neither at the private nor national level
 agast, 1947 main bharat kaa hinsak tareeke se jo vibhaajan hua, usne ek ahimsak rashtravaadi andolan ke gandhi ke prayaason par pani pher diya
 Barely six months later, he was shot dead by the Hindu fundamentalist Godse
 godse aise kai bharatiyon kaa pratinidhitiv karata tha jinka maananaa tha ki gandhi ke na rahane par ahimsa jaisi apraasangik cheez par koi charchaa nahin karegaa
 They believed that non-violence was a hindrance to the entry of a new nation in violent ways in the post-colonial future
 itihaas kii is krur karavat ke baad vah gandhi kii apni dharti thi jisane sabase pehle unki ore se apni ankhen moond leen or unhen bhulaakar aage bad gai
 Today, the symbol of Gujarat is not Gandhi but Modi, who is determined to shamelessly apply violence in its literal sense and spirit as an essential tool for administration and development
 darasal, yahaan sirf hinsa kaa maamla nahin he, balki kamajoro par varchasv kaayam karne, alpsankhyakon ko unki aukaat dikhaane or hindu prabhutv sthapit karne kii manshaa he jo modi kii raajnneeti ko gandhivaad virdohi banaati he
 In the spring of 2002, Modi's administration became a source of danger rather than protection for the Muslims of Gujarat
 aupniveshik samay se hi sampradayik hinsa ke sandarbh main sarkaar ko dosha or jimmedaari se mukt karne ke liye jis shabd kaa istemaal kiya jaataa rahaa he, vah he ‘‘sampradayik danga’’! dilli 1984, bombai 1992-93 or gujarat 2002 ko kanoon-vyavastha lagu karne vaale sarkari amale kii madad se alpsankhyak samudaayon ke purvaniyojit narsanhaar ko swat:sfoort dange ke rup main prachaarit kiya gaya he
 When Gandhi spoke of non-violence, he was teaching his followers to give up violent tendencies
 ve angreji hukum kii jor-jabardastee ke bainks logon ko apni ‘‘dangai’’ pravriti par sanyam rakhane kaa upadesh de rahe the
 On the contrary, our leaders have incited a violent trend like lava under the constantly burning political ground
 indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad 1984 ke november main kareeb 3,000 sikhon kii hatya par rajeev gandhi ne ise aprihaary bataate hue kaha tha ki ‘‘jab bada ped girtaa he to dharti hilti he
 "on Gujarat 2002, Chief Minister Modi gave the principle of action and" reaction ", by formulating the social illiteracy on the lines of Newton's third principle
 aisa lagata he ki rajya kii sansthaaen, rajnatik dal or civil socity ek gol ghere main sthit hai, or kabhi-kabhi-aise maukon par jinke bare main pehle se kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa, lekin ve puri tarah nirarthak nahin hote-us gol ghere ke centre main acolpaneey hinsa kaa visphot hota he
 Mahatma Gandhi had expressed apprehension that violence takes place at the center of social chains and individual consciousness as a motivating tendency
 lihaaja nijee samprabhutaa kaa arth is aadim pravriti par kaabo paanaa hota he
 True Swaraj is not rooted in a monopoly on violence of a sovereign state, but only in ending the desire for violence in the individual
 aadhunik rajya or nafrat ke bich bhi ek sakriy rishta hota he
 Today, citizens of democratic India need to open their eyes more towards these two elements

 grih mantralay ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha, 'online portal main aisi vyavastha he, jisase junior adhikari bhi kisi enjio ko laal nishaan ke daayre se baahar kar saktaa he, isliye ham is vyavastha main amul badlaav karne ja rahe hai, jisase keval sanyukt sachiv str ke log hi laal nishaan vaale enjio ko manjuuri de saken

 This is the 38th episode of 'mann Ki Baat' and on this occasion PM congratulated the countrymen on Constitution Day and remembered those who lost their lives in the Mumbai attack
 piem ne narendra modi mobile ap par janata se saal 2017 ke achche anubhavon ko bhi saajha karne kii apil kii
 On the occasion of Constitution Day, PM said that those who framed the Constitution should be remembered, because our Constitution has provided protection to the poor and weaker sections of the society and at the same time we should be proud of the framers of the Constitution
 unhone kaha samvidhan nirmaan main baba sahab ambedarkar kaa yogadan ahm he or unhone bharat nirmaan main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai he
 Uniting against terror, remembering the Mumbai attack, PM Modi said that the country can never forget those who lost their lives in the attack
 unhone kaha ki bharat pichley 4 dashakon se aatankwaad se peedit he, kuch saal pehle jab bharat aatankwaad ke khilaaf charchaa karata tha tab log ise gambhirtha se nahin lete the
 But today, when other countries of the world are also in it, all humanitarian forces are ready to unite against it
 piem ne duniya ke sabhi deshon se aatank ke khatme ke liye ek manch par aane kii apil kii he
 For over 4 decades, India has been raising the issue of terror
 Initially the world did not take us seriously but now the world is realising the destructive aspects of terrorism: pm@narendramodi # mannkibaatpic

 He said that while remembering the Navy, it is also important to remember the Maratha Navy and Shivaji Maharaj

 Praising the Indian Navy, PM Modi said that not only in India but also in other countries of the world, our Navy has been helping by running different operations
 deshavaasiyon ko di id kii badhaipradhanmantri ne deshavaasiyon ko id-e-milad kii badhai dete hue paigambar mohammad sahab ke janmdin kii badhai di

 At the end of every year we recall events of the year gone by
 Let us begin 2018 with a message of positivity
 i urge you to compile about 5 positive things from this year & share with me
 With # positiveindia, share your positive moments from 2017
 This will inspire others: PM— PMO India (@pmoindia) November 26, 2017 The Prime Minister on Saturday had also asked for messages from the general public in the form of suggestions
 unhone aam janata se anurodh kiya tha ki vah is baar bhi pichhali baar kii tarah hi bad-chadhakar hissaa len
 Modi also asked the public to share his message through the Narendra Modi mobile app
 pichley ek hafte se twitor par trend kar rahaa he
 The government has not banned 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil'
 cinema and exibitars association of india' ne is bahishkaar kaa aahvaan kiya he
 All the big personalities of Bollywood, especially the complacent Anurag Kashyap got so caught up in the ban and boycott that they got angry with the government as if the government itself had announced the ban
 isi kolahal ke bich ashishnutaa or 'abhivyakti kii aazaadee' par ek baar phir juthi bahes shuru ho gai
 That is why it seems that boycotting 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil' is like showing bigotry
 kuch swayambhu udaaravaadi ise aisa hi rangane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 In a society that gives freedom to propagate ideas with guarantee, no citizen or group can appeal not to watch a film
 is tarah ke vichaar ek udaaravaadi loktantric lokachar main tarksangat hai
 The difference between appealing to a boycott from fellow citizens and asking the government to impose a ban is very simple and clear
 sarkaar se pratibandh lagane kii guhaar ek loktantric adhikaar he, lekin ek sangrakshak rajya se saathi nagarikon ko koi film dekhne yaa na dekhne dene kii ijaajat maangana anaavashyak he
 The government's imposition of sanctions on its own is completely different and inconsistent in this context
 pakistan sidhe or parde ke peeche rahakar bharat se yuddh lard rahaa he
 The recent terrorist attack in Uri sector has become the focus of the entire nation
 is saal main hi bharat ne jammu-kashmir main hue hamalon main apane 71 vir javaanon ko khoyaa he
 Many citizens lost their lives, many families were devastated
 koi bhi naagarik is baat se inkaar nahin kar saktaa ki desh kii raksha kar rahe javaanon ke kaaran hi wo ek surakshit maahaul main aazaadee se ji rahe hai
 It is not wrong to appeal the boycott of the film as a retaliation for the troops stationed on the outskirts to show solidarity and challenge the enemy country
 (pratikaar, haalanki apane aap main bura mana jaataa he, un siddhanton main se he jis par karawas se lekar maut kii sajaa ke kai kanoonee masaude taiyaar kiye gaye hai)ek dushman desh se nafrat kii ja sakati he jiske parinamswaroop uske nagarikon ko bhi unki sarkaar ke kaaryon main sahabhaagi maan liya jaataa he
 Doing so is a natural reaction against those who make our lives difficult
 lekin, us film kaa bahishkaar karnaa jisamen pakistani kalakaaron ne kaam kiya he kyonki ham us desh se nafrat karte hai udaaravaadi siddhanton ke vipareet he
 It is also not wrong to say that the common Pakistani does not want war with India, as the argument of 'aman ki Asha' activists has also put
 ye ek aisa satya he jo apni naitikta kho chukaa he kyonki sandehatmak vishwasaneeyata vaale log is tark kaa istemaal apane nijee hiton ke liye karne lage hai
 It is a puzzle that how Indians who follow the liberal Sanatan religion blind themselves to the beauty of art or even to the secular quietness of commerce because it is being met by those who are compatible with us Are not
 kya dushman desh kii kala kii saraahna karnaa yaa unke dwaara utpaadit maal kii khapat aniatikat he? wasim akram kii gendbaaji kii tarif na karnaa yaa raahat fateh ali khan kii aawaaj main khokar use ansuna karnaa asambhav he
 This is also the painful truth
 kya kala or gyaan kaa parityag kar dena mahaj isliye kyonki wo vipakshiyon se mil rahe hai pratibha virdohi nahin he? ye dharmsankat bilkul vaisaa hi he jaisaa bhagavat gita main likhaa gaya he
 The question arises whether going beyond hatred for the enemy, a film in which Fawad Khan is acting may have a theoretical and subtle opposition
 yadi gaur kiya jaae to samaj paaenge ki ye vivaad darasal, udaarataavaad banaam rashtrawaad kaa he
 And if questioned like this, anyone will see it as black and white and in the end choose the one that looks white (because others are always wrong and black!)
 lekin 'udaaravaadi' or 'rashtravaadi' kaa wain aarekh alag nahin he
 Rather it is connected to each other
 aap ek udaar rashtravaadi ho sakate hai
 The patriotism and the truth can go together even if it is from any corner of the world
 vishesh rup se bharat main jahaan sanathan dharm hamen chunane ke liye kai tarah ke vikalp detaa he
 Scholar of Tamil Dr
 gnana sundaram ne haal hi main kaha he ki 'hindi na siikhnaa hindi ke liye nuksaandaayak nahin he par aapke liye he
 'similarly, not being able to use art and better products only makes us poorer
 dharmik tareeke se samajhane ke liye ki kyon hamen bahishkaar karnaa chahie or hamaare naitik jagat main ye kahaan sahi baithta he? bahishkaar ek antim karrwai or ek vichaar prakriya kaa parinaam he
 But the motive behind our thoughts is more important
 gita se lekar kaant tak gaiyr parinamwad ne naitik vajan pradaan kiya he
 How about if the film is boycotted as a method of sending a message during the time of war, not because it involves the cast of the enemy country
 yadi bahishkaar kaa aahvaan is tareeke se kiya jaataa to yakeenan adhik naitik vaidhata ke saath tark rakhaa ja saktaa he
 a citizen can urge his fellow citizens to impose costs from the warring country's elite
 is prakaar siddhant rup se ek vyakti sahishnu or gyaan kii saraahna karne vaala ban saktaa he lekin kala kaa ek lambii avadhi ke liye bahishkaar ek udaar aadesh ko badhaava degaa
 The consequences of the boycott are likely to create conditions for more art
 utpaadon va saanskrithik aayojanon kaa bahishkaar dushman samaaj ke abhijaat varg par laagat lagayegaa
 If the import of cricket or cement with any film, Pakistan, will be stopped, then it will directly affect the elite ie artists and businessmen
 isse ye sandesh jayega ki ab pehle jaisaa vyapaar nahin hoga
 The business class that funds political parties
 pakistani army se santhganth ke saath chal rahe vyapaar par bhi iskaa asar padegaa
 In this way they will be forced to lobby with their political patrons and come out of their selfishness and advocate to stop terrorism
 ye duniya ko behatar banane ke liye ek swabhaavik prayaas he
 This is a response to the arguments of all those like Richa Chadha who ask, 'will banning films end terrorism? 'dharma production or un jaise un tamaam logon kaa kya? kya jang jaise halaaton mempakistani kalakaronke saath kaam karnaa unke liye uchit he? kya vah khud ko pehle desh kaa naagarik nahin samajhate? yaa vah khud ko 'vidhaataa / rachanaakaar' maanate hai jinka pehla kartavya kala ke prati he? kya vah us samaaj ke prati udasin ho sakate hai jo unhen apni kala ko aage badhaane kii aazaadee va avasar pradaan karata he? kya jise robert rai 'aapasi jimmedaari kaa kshetra' kehete hai wo usase baahar he? bollywood ko lekar anumaan lagane ke bich hamen ise kalakaaron ke vivek or naitikta par chhod dena chahie
 The threat and pressure being given by MNS does not make our Republic a good example
 unke kaaryon se yadi desh ko paison kaa nuksaan yaa kanoon vyavastha par bura asar padataa he to shaayad kalakaaron kii aazaadee ko dhyaan main rakhte hue is samasya ke liye ek kanoon taiyaar kiya ja saktaa he
 (it is also important to know at this time that complete independence is an illusion
 thomas hobs ke saamaajik anubandh siddhant, loko or ruso hamen ye hi sikhaate hai ki samaaj main shantipurna jeene ke liye thodi si swatantraaa kaa vyapaar karnaa padataa he)har peedi par unke samay or samaaj dwaara ek naitik pariyojna thopi jaati he
 In our time, this project is nationalism
 jaisaa ki gandhi ji ne kaha he 'ham hawaaon ko bahane kii anumit to dete he lekin usamen khud ko bahane nahin dete'
 It is necessary to save our country and religion because it has the potential to give a lot to the world
 yah soch tabhi majboot ho sakati he jab hamaara abhijaat varg raajnneeti se thodi duuri bana le or hamaare saamne jang ke liye taiyaar mulk ke khilaaf khadaa ho
 a great society can only be built by trusting one another
 apane dushman main achchhai dhundne ke liye had se zyada udaaravaadi bhi nahin hona chahie
 Even the brilliant nationalist poet Subramanian Bharti has written that 'O good heart, pray to the enemy too'
 har kisi ko naitikta ke aadhaar par bahishkaar kii pairvi karne kaa adhikaar he
 The circle of false liberals can only see bigotry since the principles of liberality are in the true sense bereft of opposition to exclusion
 un logon ke str tak girane kii jarurat nahin he jo bharat se nafrat karte hai yaa jo kala kii duniya ke aatanki hai ( jinke liye naanaa patekar ne 'nakli log' kii oopaadhi di he)
 The time has come to show them a mirror, to expose their intolerance to generosity and freedom of expression
 bhaanuchandar nagarajan raajnneetik vishleshak or swatantra tippaneekar hai

 Leader of Opposition in Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly Ajay Singh has advocated the announcement of Congress candidates six months before the state assembly elections to be held in 2013
 singh ne kaha ki congress ko uttar pradesh ke samaan madhyapradesh main bhi chah maah pehle ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa kar deni chaiye
 He said that this would make it easier for the Congress to campaign
 singh ne kaha ki madhyapradesh main navambar main vidhansabha ke chunaav prastaavit hai tathaa ise dekhte hue congress ko agle saal april may tak adhikansh siton par apane ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa kar deni chaiye
 Accusing the BJP government of Madhya Pradesh of not being serious about corruption, Singh said that if the BJP government were serious about corruption, it would have approved the prosecution sought by the Lokayukta after the investigation against ministers and officials was completed
 unhone kaha ki 2008 ke purv ke anek maamle abhi bhi lambit hai or rajya sarkaar unamem abhiyojan kii sweekrut nahin de rahi he
 m pra vishesh nyaayalay vidheyak kii anumati nahin diye jane se par mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan dwaara dilli main rajghat par maun dharna dene ke elaan ke bare main puche gayi prashn ke uttar main singh ne kaha ki ek or kanoon banane se rajya main bhrashtachar samaapt nahin ho jaayegaa
 He said that there are many laws in the state that can curb corruption, but the state government lacks the will power to reduce corruption
 ullekhneey he ki kendra sarkaar dwaara vidheyak ko raashtrapati ke paas manjuuri ke liye bhej diye jane ke baad mukhyamantri ne apana maun dharna radd kar diya he
 Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan visited the Center on many matters
 pra ke saath bhedbhaav kiye jane ke aarope lagaae hai
 Describing these allegations as false, Singh said that such allegations are being made to hide their mistakes, whereas the BJP does not even thank the Center for its help
 unhone kaha ki yadi khaad kii kami he to rajya sarkaar ne samay par uski maang nahin kii
 He blamed the distribution system of the state government for the lack of fertilizer, and said that fertilizers are not available in the societies, but adequate quantity of fertilizer is available in Kalabazar
 singh ne kaha ki isi prakaar rajya sarkaar koyale kii kami kaa ronaa roti rahati he jabaki jitna koyala m
 She could not use what was allocated to Q
 unhone kaha ki jitna koyala aavantit kiya gaya utani bijli kaa utpaadan hi nahin hua
 In response to a question, Singh said that no matter how good the plans are, but if they are not well implemented, then nothing can happen
 ek anya prashn ke uttar main singh ne kaha ki bhaajapa baar-baar sushasan kaa daawa karti he lekin yadi sushasan he to pradesh main kanoon evam vyavastha kii sthiti kyon bighad rahi he or aparaadh kaa graph kyon badhata ja rahaa he
 Referring to the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, Singh said that he has been given charge of Mirzapur and Sonbhadra districts and will remain there from February 5 to February 15
 is bich ve ek din ke liye avashya congress vidhayak dal kii baithak main bhaag lene ke liye bhopal aayenge
 He said that in the meeting of the State Congress Committee for the upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, he has given instructions to those leaders who are working in the areas bordering Uttar Pradesh
 in netaaon main unke alaava bisahulaal singh, yadavendra singh, indjit kumaar, sunderlaal tiwari aadi pramukh hai
 Social activist Swami Agnivesh said that if the central government invests money on Operation Green Hunt and is ready to solve the problem of common people, then they will bring Maoists to the negotiating table
 jharkhand main atikaraman hataao abhiyaan ke baad hue hangaame ke dauraan garibon ko dilasa dene ek din kii yatra par yahaan aae swami agnivesh ne morahabadi maidan main visthapit ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, kendra sarkaar maovadiyon ke khilaaf ladaai main kharch hone vaala dhan vikaas kaaryon par kharch kare or onpareshan green hunt band kare to maovadiyon ko baatcheet ke teble par main laaungaa
 Agnivesh said that the Naxalite problem should be resolved in the country by talking to the Maoists and there is no reason for conflict with their own people
 isse pehle unhone aarope lagaaya ki jharkhand kii rajya sarkaar atikaraman hataao abhiyaan main ujaad rahe lakhon garibon ke punarvaas kii koi vyavastha nahin kar rahi he jisase khilaaf vah rashtriya andolan khadaa karenge or aavashyaktaa padane par sarvocch nyaayalay kaa darwaja bhi khatkhataayenge
 Team India is in England on a mission to win the World Cup
 shuruaati do match main shandaar jeet bhi hui he lekin intjaar 16 june kaa he
 When there is to be a contest between India and Pakistan
 match se pehle star sports ne ek vigyaapan banaaya he, jisamen sidhe taur par naa sahi lekin ghuma-firaakar bharat ko pakistan team kaa 'baap' bataaya gaya
 Father-son is mentioned in the add because on 16 June is Father's Day
 bhale hi is vigyaapan ko hits mil rahe hon lekin soshal media par ek tikhi bahes chhidi he
 Not only has the debate erupted, but advertisements from both countries are being used against each other
 darasal, ye vigyaapan thik usee tarj par banaaya gaya he jaisaa pichley worldcup main mauka-mauka tha
 The advertisement became a big hit and people shared it openly
 shaayad isi 'maukey' ko ek baar phir se bhunaane kii koshish kii gai he
 In the new advertisement, it is the same actor who played the role of a Pakistani fan, just this time the characters of Bangladesh and India have changed
 pehle aapako bataate hai ki nae vigyaapan main kya he
 It happens that Bangladesh (character) comes to Pakistan (character) and then says that Bhaijaan! The seventh time by chance
 phir pakistan jawaab detaa he ki abbu ne kaha he ki koshish karne waalon kii haar nahin hoti or saamne baitha hindustan kah rahaa he ki maine tumhen kab sikhaaya? yahaan dekhen vigyaapan
 
 
 The controversy has just spread on this, social media users are writing that how can we call a country our son
 jab desh itnaa aage bad gaya he, har cheez main ham number van ban rahe hai to phir bhi itani choti soch kyon he ki tu meraa betaa or main tera baap!@starsportsindiastop doing these cheap advertisement of WC matches

 People feel this video is an opportunity and they are making them crazy
 cricket phens ko lag rahaa he ki har worldcup kii tarah is baar bhi bharat pakistan ko haraayega or cricket kaa baap sabit hoga
 When this advertisement of Star Sports was debated on social media, Pakistan also released an advertisement
 isamen bhartiya vayusena ke wing commander abhinandan kaa mazaaq udaaya gaya he
 Indians are angry at this advertisement
 haalanki, jawaab main pakistani khilaadi bhi tark de rahe hai ki jab apane vigyaapan main india unhen betaa bataa rahaa he to phir pakistani aid main abhinandan kaa mazaaq udana mudda kyon ban rahaa he

 com / epjh0gxq21 —hassaan Niazi (@hniaziisf) June 10, 2019 It is worth noting that cricket matches between India and Pakistan are not a common match
 donon deshon ke samarthak iskaa besabri se intjaar karte hai or jab baat worldcup kii ho to phir josh charam par hota he
 This time the match is also important because the negotiations between the two countries have been stalled, in the past, a war-like situation was created
 pulavama main hamalaa hua, balakot main airstrike hui
 In such a situation, the sentiments of cricket fans are hitting a lot of vibes for this match of the World Cup
 ab sabko besabri se 16 june kaa intjaar he
 They also say that the fundamental right granted by the Constitution cannot be violated and Section 144 enforced by the Delhi Police is arbitrary and illegal
 yachika main sanghathan ne sujhaayaa he ki india get ke paas boat club par shantipurna pradarshan ke liye vaikalpik taur par ijaajat di ja sakati he
 Disappointed over the issue of One Rank One Pension, some ex-servicemen are going to protest at Jantar Mantar once again
 khaas baat yah he ki is baar yah pradarshan gandhi janyati yani do oktober se shuru hone ja rahaa he or dilli ke alaava duusare shaharon main bhi yojit kiya jayega
 Major General Satbir Singh, an advisor to the United Front of x Servicemen, an organization of ex-servicemen, said that in a meeting with Defense Minister Manohar Parikar on 14 March 2016, he had said that you should keep a gun on your head and ask the government Can't get your demand iske baad 29 april ko purv sainikon ne jantar-mantar or kai duusari jagahon par riley bhukh hadtaal ko asthai taur khatm kar diya tha
 Singh said that the soldiers were hopeful that the government would implement the OROP at the appointed time
 pradarshan karne vaale purv sainikon ke mutabik paanch maheene biit jane ke baad bhi koi sakaaratmak sandesh nahin mila he
 The government has set up a one-member judicial commission to remove the discrepancies
 justise reddy 16 jagahon par gaye bhi lekin kuch baat nahin bani
 According to them, there is no work of judicial commission in policy matters
 abhi tak is samiti ne apni report bhi nahin di he
 The comments purv sainikon ko lagata he ki sarkaar nyaay nahin kar rahi he
 These soldiers believe that they are deeply disappointed by the apathy and arrogance of the government
 purv sainikon ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko 15 sitambar 2013 ko rewadi main oropi ko lekar kiya gaya apana vaada yaad dilaayaa
 Major General Satbir Singh told NDTV India that after five months had passed, neither the government spoke to him nor the actors sitting in the government showed their appearance
 civil kshetra main kaary karne waalon ke liye saatvaan vetan ayog aa gaya lekin phogiyon ke liye abhi tak nahin
 Therefore, this demonstration will continue till the real one gets one rank one pension
 haalanki sarkaar ne pehle hi spasht kar diya he ki wo purv sainikon ke liye van rank van pension lagu kar chuki he
 The last time the ex-servicemen held a relay hunger strike at Jantar Mantar for about 360 days
 yah puche jane par ki vetan ko lekar sainikon kaa jantar-mantar par jamaavada kitna shaleen he, general satbir singh kaa kahana he ki wo yah ladaai izzat or insaaf ke liye lard rahe hai na ki paise ke liye

 Ex-servicemen reminded Prime Minister Narendra Modi of his promise made on 15 September 2013 regarding OROP in Rewari
 major general satbir singh ne enditivi india se kaha ki paanch maheene biit gaye, na to sarkaar ne unase baat kii or na hi sarkaar main baithe kartadhartaaon ne apni shakl hi dikhaai
 The Seventh Pay Commission has come for those working in the civil sector but not yet for the soldiers
 lihaaja jab tak asli vaali van rank van pension nahin mil jaati tab tak yah pradarshan jari rahegaa

 shainanc (@shainanc)march 1, 2015 You must have heard that after marriage, two separate lives become one
 unki khushiyaan ek ho jaati hai or unke dukh bhi ek ho jate hai lekin kya aap jaanate hai shaadi ke baad ek partner kii beemaari, duusare ko bhi ho jaati he
 According to a new study, if you marry a weak person, then the chances of your becoming weak after marriage also increases and if you marry a depression victim then your chances of getting depressed also increase
 
 adhyayan ke anusaar, bujurgon menkamajori or avsaad hone kaa ek bada kaaran unke jeevanasathika aisa hona hota he
 The greater the weakness in an aged woman or man, the more depressed they become
 saath hi jitna adhik avsaad hoga, utani hi adhik kamajori hogi
 The study, published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, analyzes the effects of weakness and depression on married people
 dhyaan dene yogya baat yah he ki adhik umr vaale pati kam umr vaale pati kii tulana main adhik avsaadagrast or kamjor hote hai lekindhik umr vaali patni kam umr vaali patni se adhikvsaadagrast nahin hoti he
 Yes, but they are relatively weak
 danpatiyon ke maamle main kamajori or avsaad ek duusare se jude hue ho sakate hai
 From this it can be assumed that attention should be paid to increase activeness in couples, increase sociality and increase mutual support

 YEH SAB CHOR HAIN PAANCH SAAL PAISA KHAATE HAIN AUR JANTA KO LOOT LETE HAIN KAMINE KUTTE- PAPPU JIMADRAS
 SBK Arvind Kejriwal's mission Banaras has started today
 kejariwal subah hi banaras pahunche
 Where he was strongly welcomed by the workers of the Aam Aadmi Party
 kejariwal duusari baar banaras pahunche hai lekin is baar tehraav lanbaa he, or makasad puri tarah se raajnneetik
 In the first tour, the city was identified and this time it is going to try to test the mood of the people of the city
 tabhi to aaj se shuru ho rahe he varanasi daure main sabase pehle kejariwal dalit basti kaa rukh karenge
 There are about 1 lakh Dalit voters in Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency and why should Kejriwal avoid voting for them in his favor
 haalanki dilli main kaashi kooch se pehle unhone yahi kaha ki apane liye nahin balki desh bachaane ke liye varanasi ja rahe he
 In Varanasi, Kejriwal faces no one else but Narendra Modi, and before reaching Varanasi, Kejriwal appealed to the people to join him in this biggest battle from his own coach
 unhone twitor par likhaa, 'varanasi-amethi ke liye nikal gaya hum
 To begin the great revolution
 kripya desh ke liye dua kiijie
 Your prayers have always charisma
 agar vakt he to varanasi yaa amethi zarur aaie
 'election in Varanasi is on 12 May and Kejriwal will be camping in Kashi till 12 May
 kejariwal kii kaashi kilabandi kaa plan puri tarah se taiyaar he
 The activists have a list of instructions, following which Kejriwal wants to execute his mission and purpose
 ek najar jaraa kejariwal ke kaashi plan par bhi
 Kejriwal's 'plan Kashi' will hold small meetings with people in Varanasi before voting
 iske alaava kuch dinon ke antaraal par badi reliyaan bhi kii jaaengi
 Kejriwal will also meet the people of Kashi and leaflets explaining the policy of Aam Aadmi Party and the rules will also be distributed among them
 kejariwal apane virodhiyon ko bhi samajhane kii koshish karenge
 a meeting will also be organized with the voters for mass media, in which the questions of the people will be taken and their answers will also be given by Kejriwal
 sutron kii maane to aam aadmi party ne varanasi ke 16 lakh votaron main se 10 lakh matadaataaon se sidhe samvaad ke liye 10 lakh rupee kaa bajet banaaya he
 a full team of 500 workers will carry out this work
 vaise kejariwal ne abhi se hi kaashi vaasiyon ko saavdhaan karne ke liye unke dimag main ye baat daalani shuru kar di he ki agar modi kaashi ke king banate bhi hai to agle hi din uskaa tyagkar vadodara kii dagar par chal padenge
 The situation is clear that Kejriwal party is making full use of heart and mind to conquer Kashi
 koshish damdaar he lekin ye tabhi sarthak hoga jab kaashi kii janata ise kabool karegi
 The leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party will continue to clamor for their candidature for the Chief Minister's post during the first six months, without realizing that they must first have a sufficient number of mlas to form the government
 saal ke duusare hisse main yah najaara hoga ki netaa apane adhiktam samarthakon ko tikat dilwane ke liye jute rahenge, bagaiyr yah tay kiye ki tikat paane kii iklauti kasuti chunaav jeetne kii unki kshamta honi chahie
 In January, the self-proclaimed chief ministerial candidate of the bjp's Gulabchand Kataria will take out his journey in tribal areas to strengthen the hands of his supporters to get tickets
 iske kaaphi baad vasundhara raaje apana chunaav prachaar abhiyaan shuru karengi
 The RSS will continue to spoil everyone's game by making unnecessary interference in the whole matter
 sangh asahmatiyon ko to jagah de degaa, lekin isse hue nuksaan kii jimmedaari ko uthaane ke liye katai taiyaar nahin hoga
 In the second part of the year, his opponents will have easy access to Vasundhara Raje and their understanding will also increase
 congress ke liye aglaa chunaav jeetna kathin chunauti hoga
 Therefore, there may not be much fighting in the ticket within it
 iske baavjood si
 P
 joshi, bhavar jitendra singh or sachin payalat apane samarthakon ko zyada-se-zyada tikat dilwane kaa prayaas karenge or sabase bada hissaa le jaaenge
 Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot may have to go to Sonia Gandhi's shelter to get his supporters a ticket
 jaipur main congress kaa jo rashtriya adhiveshan hone vaala he, usee ko dekhakar samaj aata he ki congress rajasthan ke vidhansabha chunaav ko kitni ahmiyat de rahi he
 Gehlot will try his best not to publicize any news against him and neither his opponents nor the media
 is dauraan koi bhi badi aapraadhik ghatana, kisi ghotaale kaa khulaasa yaa phir koi aapadaa unki chhavi ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakati he
 The monsoon will prove to be crucial this time for the state
 agar barish acchhee hui to congress kii kuch siton main ijapha ho saktaa he
 If there is a drought, the ruling Congress and top officials will get a chance to cut money in the name of drought relief
 isse bijepi ke do ahm chunavi mudde majboot hokar ubharenge: bhrashtachar or gahalot sarkaar kii naakaami
 The more fear Gehlot gets from Raje, the sharper he will become in his attacks
 chunki bijepi ke kai netaaon ko gahalot ne phayda pahunchaaya he or is tarah bhrashtachar ke maamalon par unka munh band rakhaa he, isliye pratikriya main ve gahalot par sidhe hamale se bachenge
 Instead, he would advise Raje to remain positive
 haalanki raaje rajya ke liye sakaaratmak or gahalot ke liye nuksaandaayak ranneeti kaa santulan saadh kar in netaaon ko niraash hi karengi
 The political fate of the BJP leader Rajendra Singh Rathore is to be decided this year, who is accused of killing Dara Singh in custody
 isi saal jalmahal pariyojna, bhrasht kaarobaariyon-netaaon kii kismat bhi tay hogi, jo is mahalut main shaamil rahe hai
 Many more cases of corruption are yet to come, even if disclosed, BJP leaders will have no hand in it
 is baar vidhansabha chunaav disambar main hone hai or pichhali baar kii 200 main se 96 siton par pichhlaa pradarshan doharaana gahalot ke liye pehle ke mukaable kahin zyada chunauteepurn hoga
 However, if the BJP is entangled in its over-confidence and mutual disunity, then the issue will be whether Gehlot will be able to perform as Manmohan Singh did in 2009? The BJP can hope to win only if it manages to develop its Rajasthan-centric strategy under the umbrella of Vasundhara Raje as soon as possible
 kataaria jaise netaaon kaa istemaal unke prabhaav vaale kshetron main party ke liye zyada se zyada siten laane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Those who conspired with Gehlot in closed doors must have shown him the way out
 chaahe cricket ho yaa koi anya khel, congressiyon kii aapasi ladaaiyon kaa asar sab par padegaa or rajya kaa pradarshan badtar bana rah saktaa he
 Seeing this, it is understandable that the Congress is giving importance to the Rajasthan assembly elections

 Arvind Paranjpe of the Inter University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) said that there will be an opportunity to see the event in winter night

 CB Devgan of the Science Popularization Association of Communicators and Educators (space) said observers from Europe and Africa would not be able to see the early stages of the eclipse as they would occur before the Moon's emergence
 planetary sosayadi of india ke en raghunandan kumaar ne kaha ki yah grahan 2018 tak kaa sabase lambii avadhi vaala grahan hoga
 He said that India is one of the most suitable places to witness this astronomical event where the eclipse can be seen in its various stages from beginning to end
 kumaar ke anusaar bharat or iske aasapaas ke logon ke liye shuru se lekar ant tak (vibhinn charan) purna chandragrahan dekhne kaa mauka 27, 28 july 2018 ko aayega

 agar aap DTH oparator tata ski ke customer hai to aapke liye yah khabar behad jaruri he
 In fact, Tata Sky has been accused of misleading its customers
 is shikaayat ke baad bhartiya doorsanchaar niamak praadhikaran (tri) ne tata ski se states report bhi maangi he
 Explain that TRAI has given time till 31 January for the customers to choose the channel under the new regulatory system
 nae niyamon ke tahat darshak sirf un channelon kaa chayan kar sakate hai or bhugtan kar sakate hai jo ve dekhnaa chaahate hai
 TRAI has written to Tata Sky, according to news agency PTI
 is patr main kaha gaya he- customers se badi sankhya main shikaayatein mili hai ki company ne nai niamkeey ruparekha ke tahat apni pranali main customers ko vikalp kaa praavdhaan nahin kiya he
 In addition, Tata Sky's customer service centers are misleading customers
 in kendron par kaha ja rahaa he ki tri ne nai niamkeey vyavastha ke kriyanvayan kii taarikh badha di he
 TRAI said that this information is completely wrong
 tri ke mutabik usne customers ko tivi channel chunane ke liye 31 janvari, 2019 tak kaa samay diya he
 For information, let us know that these new rules were to come into effect from December 29 but after the request of broadcasters and DTH operators, TRAI decided to extend it till January 31
 kya he nayaa niyamatrai ke nae niyam ke tahat customer apane dit oparate ko sirf utana hi paisa denge jitne channel dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Till now it has been that customers used to recharge monthly plans ranging from 250 to 300 rupees
 is masik plan main aapaki pasand ke channel to hote the lekin wo channel bhi hote the jinhen customer kabhi dekhte nahin the
 At the same time, the customer has to pay extra price to watch many of his favorite channels
 yani tri ke nae niyam lagu hone ke baad customer par dit oparator channel nahin thope sakenge
 Understand in easy language, users have to pay for the channels they want to watch
 tri ke is nae niyam ke tahat dit oparator ko sabhi channel alag- alag yaa kisi ek buke main dene honge
 With this, the user will also be told the price of each channel on the TV screen
 Press Release on Implementation of New Regulatory Framework for Broadcasting & Cable Serviceshttps: / / t
 co / 2xxw5gu0no — TRAI (@TRAI) January 8, 2019 Under trai's new system, the customer will have to pay a network capacity fee of Rs 130 + GST to use the services
 yah customer ko die jane vaale 100 channelon kaa shulk he
 In these 100 channels, TV operators will have to compulsorily have 24 channels of Prasar Bharati
 vahiin agar koi customer 100 se adhik channel sabsakrive karnaa chahta he to use 20 se 25 rupee prati channel extra charge ke rup main bhugtan karne honge
 The teachings of Shri Krishna are as important for the youth in this age as it was for Arjuna
 jaaniye unke die vyavhaarik gyaan kaa saar, kaise aaj ke pratiyogi yug main bhi safalataa kii guarantee detaa he
 1
 krishna har morche par krantikari vichaaron ke dhani rahe hai
 His biggest attraction is that he did not follow any banded rut
 maukey kii jarurat ke hisaab se unhone apni bhoomika badali or arjuna ke sarathi tak bane
 2
 bhagwaan krishna ne pandavon kaa saath har mushkil vakt main dekar yah sabit kar diya tha ki dost vahi achche hote hai jo kathin se kathin paristhiti main aapkaa saath dete hai
 There is no place for conditions in friendship, so you should also keep such friends around you who will be your support in every difficult situation
 3
 Arjuna, the greatest warrior of Mahabharata, not only learned from his Guru but he always kept learning something from his experiences
 yah sikh har student ke liye jaruri he
 Students should always learn from their mistakes and failures apart from teachers
 4
 If the Pandavas did not have the master strategy of Lord Krishna, the Pandavas could hardly have won the war
 isliye kisi bhi pratiyogi pariksha kii taiyaari karne ke liye stratji bananaa aavashyak he
 5
 Don't worry, be happy
 This funde has been taught by Krishna in the Gita
 'kyon vyarth chintaa karte ho? kisase vyarth main darate ho?'6
 If you read any story related to Krishna, you will clearly see that a person should be visionary and should come to assess the situation
 7
 Krishna also teaches us that courage should not be lost in times of trouble or lack of success
 isaki bajaay haar kii vajahon ko jaanakar aage badhanaa chahie
 Face problems
 ek baar dar ko paar kar liya to phir jeet aapke kadamon main hogi
 8
 management ke sabase bade guru hai bhagwaan krishna
 He gave the mantra of living in discipline, not worrying in vain, and focusing on the present instead of the future
 9
 When Lord Krishna saw the poverty of his friend Sudama, he made a palace in place of his hut before reaching his house
 isliye kehete hai ki dosti krishna se kerani seekhni chahie or rishton main kabhi ohade ko bich main nahin laana chahie
 10
 sidhe raste se sab paanaa aasaan nahin hota
 Especially when you have a heavy upper hand
 aise main kootneeti kaa rasta apanaaen
 Krishna is also considered the greatest diplomat

 The song is composed by Ayush Shrestha and Savera Mehta
 iske alaava gane ke bol likhe hai manoj tapadia ne
 The song featured glimpses of Anushka and Bhupalam's Happy Married Life, along with some scenes of the incident that took place in the film, have also been included in the song's video

 See the new song 'main Joe' from the film 'NH10' monsoon satr main sarkaar ko gherne kii ranneeti par ravivaar ko bijepi sansadeey dal ke sheersh netaaon ne baithak kii
 In this meeting held at the residence of senior party leader LK Advani, a plan was prepared to surround the government on issues like inflation and corruption
 somvaar se shuru ho rahe sansad ke monsoon satr main food sicurity bill, bhoomi adhigrahan bill, retail epadiai jaise muddon par bijepi kaa aakraamak rukh rahegaa
 Apart from this, the issue of Telangana will also be raised
 saath hi bijpi kii kolgate scam par bhi sarkaar ko gherne kii koshish hogi
 BJP has demanded that a proposal for formation of a separate Telangana state be brought at the beginning of the session
 party ne monsoon satr main uttarakhand main ai aapadaa, sibiai banaam ibi kalah, epadiai, rupee ke avamulyan or desh kii arthvyavastha kii sthiti aadi vishyon par charchaa karaane ke notice die hai
 The Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress has also aggressively said that the government must first assure that no new state will be considered after Telangana
 vah yah aashwaasan chaahati he ki congress ke netaa pashchim bengal main ‘gorkhaland’ kii maang ko hawa nahin den
 The SP, which is supporting the government from outside, has also taken a tough stand on the Food Security Bill, saying that if the 'anti-farmer' things are not removed from it, then the session will be difficult to run smoothly
 dramuk or trinmul sahit kai dalon ne vidhayika ke kaamkaaj main nyaaypalika ke hastkshep ke mudde par is satr ke dauraan gambhir charchaa karaane kii maang kii he
 These parties say that the Judge Appointment Bill should be decided and the rights of the Supreme Court and High Courts need to be discussed
 udhar sarkaar ne aashwaasan diya he ki vah vipaksh ko andolit karne vaale vishyon kaa sammaan karegi
 In the monsoon session, 44 bills are to be put up for consideration, 6 are to be withdrawn and 14 others are to be introduced
 lekin satr main keval 16 baithken honi hai
 In such a situation, it is impossible to handle so many legislative functions
 adhiktar raajnneetik dalon dwaara 5 se 30 agast tak chalane vaale satr ko bahut hi kam bataae jane par sarkaar ne aashwaasan diya he ki agar aavashyaktaa padi to ise or badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kamal Nath has assured that if necessary, the duration of the session can be extended to cover all subjects
 kamalnath ne is baat se bhi inkaar kiya ki monsoon satr sansad kaa antim satr hoga or desh nirdhaarit samay se pehle chunaavon kii ore batch rahaa he
 He said that this would be followed by two more i

 He appealed to the people to await the decision of a judicial inquiry into the incident

 National Conference activist Syed Mohammad Yousuf died in police custody on 13 September
 rishi ne tivi channel ko bataaya tha ki yusuf ne mantri banane ke naam par ek anya kaaryakarta mohammad yusuf bhatta se rishwat lee thi
 He told that this amount was taken to give to Farooq Abdullah
 kendriya mantri ne kaha, "nyaayik jaanch ke nishkarsho kaa intjaar kiijie
 The truth will be known
 " unhone apane putr evam rajya ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla kaa bhi bachaav kiya or kaha ki mukhyamantri ne nyaayik jaanch kaa nirnay khud hi liya he
 He denied that bribes are taken for the post of minister in the National Conference

 Former Gujarat Chief Minister Shankersinh Vaghela has made a big charge against the Bharatiya Janata Party
 unhone kaha ki pulavama aatanki hamalaa bijepi kii sajeesh thi, jaise godhra cond tha
 NCP leader Shankersinh Vaghela said that "the vehicle used to carry RDX in Pulwama terror attack had its registration number from Gujarat"
 unhone aage kaha, 'godhra cond bhi bijepi kii sajeesh thi'
 Speaking to the media, Shankersinh Vaghela said, "BJP has been resorting to terrorism to win elections
" pichley 5 saalon main tamaam aatankwaadi hamale hue''
 Shankersinh Vaghela did not stop here
 unhone kaha, 'balakot airstrike bijepi kii sochi-samajhi sajeesh thi
 No one was killed in the Balakot attack
 yahaan tak ki koi antarrashtriya agency bhi yah sabit nahin kar pai ki air strike main 200 log maare gaye the'
 Vaghela said, despite receiving information from intelligence sources about Pulwama, no action was taken
 unhone bijepi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki agar aapke paas balakot ko lekar jaankaree thi to pehle hi in aatanki camp ke khilaaf karrwai kyon nahin kii? aap kyon intjaar kar rahe the ki pulavama jaisi koi ghatana ho
 Lashing out at BJP, Shankersinh Vaghela said, 'bjp's Gujarat model is false
 rajya tamaam mushkilon se guzar rahaa he
 The BJP leaders themselves are angry with the party and feel that they are bonded laborers
 aapako bataa den ki gujarat main 26 loksabhaa siten hai

 John Abraham never got into romance in life because he does not want to leave any weakness in front of the drug dealers
 lekin jab maaya yani genelia disuja kii entry hoti he to ye officer khud ko roak nahin paata
 But the situation changes when the drug mafia selectively starts enmity with the families of narcotic officers
 isse pehle 'mumbai meri jaan' jaisi film bana chuke diarector nishikant kaamat kii 'force' tamil film 'kaaka kaaka' kii rimek he
 Some action scenes of the film are definitely off, especially where John picks up the bike and kills the enemy
 lekin kai ection seens josh dilaane main naakaam hai
 Shot in many scenes dim light, that's why 'force' seems a bit dull
 mujhe andeh he ki narcotic officers ke bich fast pes complex dialogs kaaman main samaj paaegaa jiske liye ection film 'force' bani he
 The action films of Salman and Ajay Devgan go into single screens due to their simplicity
 sabase impressive hai chulabuli or bold maaya ke role main genelia disuja
 His dialogues will put a smile on his face

 Mishra currently blows something in this style, "first let Ebola come to India
 aap abhi se itnaa kyon ghabara rahi hai?’’ subah ke nau baje hai
 The sanitation workers are working in the hospital, the smell of anti-septic is spread in the corridor
 doctor aa-ja rahe hai
 The process of arrival of patients has started
 ek chota ladkaa khamosh baitha he or maa uske ganje sir ko sahala rahi he
 This is a common sight in this complex
 lekin ye din saamaanya nahin hai
 The whole world is terrified by the outbreak of the epidemic called Ebola
 yah laailaaj he, ab tak iskaa koi tikaa ijad nahin ho paaya he
 By sneezing, coughing or any kind of bodily secretion, even from dead bodies, its virus spreads and becomes fatal to its prey
 farvari 2014 se ab tak yah 4,500 logon kii jaan le chukaa he yani isse prabhavit lagbhag aadhe log maare ja chuke hai
 The World Health Organization (WHO) says that no country is safe from it
 usne disambar kii shuruyaat tak har hafte isse grast 10,000 nae maamalon kaa andeshaa jataayaa he
 The United Nations has warned the world that Ebola is "speeding up and beating us
" ’’ agar agle 60 dinon main use nahin roka ja sakaa to ‘‘hamaare saamne aisi mahavipatti khadi ho jaaegi, jiske bare main hamaari koi yojana nahin he
 The epidemic from Africa spread from the village of Guekedo in southeastern Guinea in Africa, where a two-year-old child died in December 2013
 yah ibola se pehali maut maani jaati he isliye use ‘‘child jiro’’ kaha gaya
 The virus was also named after the Ebola River Valley because its first case was reported here
 yah virus 1976 se hi samay-samay par ubharta rahaa he
 The root of this disease is told in the cultural customs of Africa, that is, it is spread by their food habits and customs of death
 vahaan hiran, chimpanji, chamagadad, chuuhe, saanp jaise junglee jaanwaron ke maance se vyanjan banaae jate hai
 But viruses of this disease can also occur in animals
 ‘‘child jiro’’ kaa parivaar chamagaadadon kaa shikaar kiya karata tha
 In Africa, Ebola is also spread by rituals of death, the practice of bathing, touching and kissing a dead body
 shav main iske virus behad sakriy ho jate hai
 Before the outbreak of Ebola there were only a few hundred cases
 isliye duniya kaa dhyaan udhar nahin gaya lekin agast main jab dablyuechao ne duniya bhar ke liye khatre kii chetavanee jari kii to hadakamp much gaya
 How much if Ebola spreads its feet in India? It is necessary to keep Ebola patients completely separate
 lekin aisi suvidha mutthibhar aspataalon main hi he, to bharat isse paar paa sakegaa? bada khatra yah he ki gambhir marijon ko khun kii ultiyaan hone lagati hai, uske sharir se niklaa srav yaa khun behad sankramak hota he
 In our crowded country, how much will be the system of keeping patients alone? Blood samples of patients suffering from Ebola infection etc
 should also be examined with extreme caution
 kya hamaare yahaan yah sambhav ho paaegaa? sankraman kaa sabase zyada kareeb 10 pratishat tak khatra swasthyakarmiyon yani doctoron, nurson vagairah ko he, unke tamaam atyaadhunik suraksha kavach dispojable goun, phase mask or dabl letex glavj ke baavjood
 So, is India ready to deal with such a situation? Increasing risk: The risk of this epidemic is increasing everyday
 to bharat main isaki kitni chintaa honi chahie? pehle buree khabar dekhen
 Director of Harvard Global Health Institute and Professor of International Health at Harvard School of Public Health, Dr
 ashish jha i-mail intervyuu main kehete hai, ‘‘pashchim africa main agar sankraman kii yahi dar jari rahi to badi ashanka he ki jald hi iske maamle bharat main pahunch jaaenge
 "the good news is that the WHO has issued emergency warnings in 15 countries, India is not named
" africa main ibola ke failaav ke saghan kshetron-siyara leone, gini or liberia-se hawaii yatriyon kii awajahi ke maamle main bharat main jokhim kam he
 There is a possibility of infection through air travelers and in this case India ranks 24th among the 30 countries suspected of spreading Ebola in the near future
 boston main north eastern uniwarsity ke vaigyanikon ne is tathy ke aadhaar par yah aankada computer modelling se nikaala he ki bharat main pashchim africa se sidhi udaanen maamuli hi hai
 But beware: India is just four places below Spain in this list
 spain main africa ke baahar ibola virus rog (ividi) kaa pehla maamla darj hua he
 The international fraternity has suddenly begun to look at the "lackluster and overcrowded" hospitals of Alam Bharat
 17 aktubar ko neuyork times main chape ek lekh main chetaya gaya, ‘‘bharat main zyada khatra baahar se nahin, balki vahaan kii lastpast saarvajanik swasthya seva se he
 According to Professor Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, which discovered the Ebola virus in 1976, a case of infection in a relatively poor and densely populated country like India could also bring a frightening view
 videsh main kaam kar rahe bhartiya sankraman ke bade strot ho sakate hai
 Africa is the new destination for trade and investment
 vahaan bharat se kareeb 55 arab dollar kaa vyapaar hota he or vahaan kareeb 200 bhartiya companiyaan kaam kar rahi hai
 There are around 45,000 Indians working in West Africa itself
 hafte main saaton din kaam kar kuch hafton ke liye ghar aana unke liye aam baat he
 If an infected person returns home within 21 days of the virus incubation period, then he can call the dreaded scene
 2009 main bharat main swine flu isi tarah failaa tha
 Then a 23-year-old infected boy came to Hyderabad from the US
 piyot kehete hai, ‘‘bharat main doctor or nurse amuman rakshaatmak globe nahin pahante
 They can fall prey to infection and cause it to spread
 ’’ dow
 Jha is of the same opinion, "is India's health system capable of detecting, treating and preventing this deadly virus?" mujhe dar he ki vahaan aise halaat nahin hai
 However, in 2003, when the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was spreading worldwide, India's healthcare failures were questioned
 isolation room, ventilataron ke abhaav se lekar prashikshit doctoron or swasthyakarmiyon kii kami tathaa mahamari ke prati logon main jaagrukta na hone kaa hallaa machaaya gaya tha
 But the threat of SARS did not reach India
 isi tarah 2009 main swine flu kii mahamari kaa bhay failaayaa gaya lekin vaisaa kuch nahin hua
 Virologist Dr
, a faculty member in the Department of Microbiology in different types of viruses
 lalit daar kehete hai, ‘‘ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin he
 "viral diseases spread through contact, water, food or air
 hawa se failane vaale virus zyada ghaatak hote hai
 But in India, not a single case of SARS spread by air and more contagious was seen
 ibola hawa ke jariye nahin failata
 Ebola-infected patients can cause infection in 1-2 people while SARS can spread in 3-4 people and measles in 15-18 people
 daar kehete hai, ‘‘ibola itnaa hi sankramak hota to ab tak 30,000 se 40,000 tak maut ho jaatin
 Ebola is the only filovirus with a mild protein coating on the genetic formula
 is virus ke ansh sankramit vyakti ke rakt, peshaab, paseene, thook, ulti, dast vagairah main thik echivi kii tarah hote hai
 But in case of untreated HIV patient, there may be 50,000 to 100,000 viruses in the body, then one spoonful of blood of Ebola patient can contain 10 billion viruses
 dow
 "ebola needs an entrance to spread, for example a wound or a bruise," Dar explains
 koi marij ke srav ke sthaan jaise naak, aankh, munh ko chhu le to yah failata he
 "therefore the risk is high for the people engaged in the patient
 ibola us vyakti se bhi nahin failata jisamen lakshan nahin dikh rahe hon or vah sankraman kii avadhi puri hone ke daur main ho
 There is also a danger of Ebola being treated as dengue as both cause high fever, headache and fatigue
 lekin ibola main ulti-dast hote hai or khun bhi nikalnaa shuru ho jaataa he
 But, he says, "the current spill of Ebola is not causing much blood vomiting
 is baar usase marane waalon kii dar bhi 50 fisadi hi he
 "vigilant Bharat When 112 Indians left from Liberia on 26 August, no one knew what was in their fate
 bhartiya infrastracchar company effcons ke karmchaaree ibola ke khauf se bharat lautne ko betaab the
 17 passengers landed in Mumbai and 17 in Delhi
 unhen bharat main ‘‘ibola drill’’ se guzarana padaa
 It has been operating at 19 airports in the country since early August
 unase sambhavit shaareerik lakshanon ke form bharwaaye gaye or bukhaar dekhne ke liye thermal scinar se guzarana padaa
 All but one passenger from Delhi were declared free from Ebola infection
 dilli vaale yatri kaa galaa kharaab tha or use bukhaar tha
 The doctor immediately took him to an isolation room at the airport
 kuch din baad test negative aane par use jane diya gaya
 In the last few months, India has screened 22,000 passengers and treated around 450 suspected symptoms
 swasthya mantralay ke disha-nirdeshon ke mutabik, jinamein lakshan dikhte hai, unhen hawaii adde par hi isolation kaksh main rakhaa jaataa he, jo log kisi ibola marij se kisi tarah se jude rahe hai, unki saghan nigaraanee kii jaati he or jinamein koi lakshan nahin hai yaa kisi ke sampark main nahin rahe hai, unhen helpline ke number de die jate hai, taaki baad main koi lakshan ubhare to ve fouran sampark karen
 Safety devices for health workers have been sent to the states
 swasthya mantralay ne jila aspataalon main doctoron or nurson ke prashikshan ke liye ibola ‘‘master classes’’ bhi shuru kii he
 The earlier lesson that India will be able to deal with Ebola is the belief that it has come from the methods adopted in 2009 to prevent swine flu
 dow
 Mishra says, "we have a system of isolation, treatment of infection, safe wearing and trained personnel
" ’’ saavdhaanee baratane par ibola main sankraman kii sambhaavna kaaphi kam ho jaati he
 "our doctors do routine surgeries in cases of HIV or hepatitis C," he says
 agar ibola bharat main mahamari kaa rup le letaa he to apaat chikitsa ke visheshgy dow
 Mishra recommends portable "container hospitals"
 apaat chikitsa ke liye aabaadi se dur portable oparation theatre banane ke prayog main norge, america or israel agrani bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai
 Dr
 mishra kehete hai, ‘‘bharat fouj kii madad se yah kaam teji se kar saktaa he
 Ebola is being overreacted everywhere for political gains
 washington main centre for dijis dynamiks, iconomics and policy ke nideshak, jo bharat main public health foundation ke ucch padaadhikari hai, ramanan lakshminarayan kehete hai, ‘‘america main ek vyakti kii maut or do nurson ke sankramit hone se hi baari ghabrahat fail gai
 "but there is no talk of five people who reached America for treatment, who neither died nor spread infection from them
" unke mutabik, ‘‘madhyavadhi chunaav sir par hai to america ke netaa ibola ko apane prachaar main zyada hawa de rahe hai
 "they believe that India's problem is that" If someone in the US raises a finger on India's healthcare, then we also repeat the same
 sachaai yah he ki bharat kii swasthya seva tamaam dikkaton ke baavjood utani kamjor nahin he
 India successfully controlled the highly contagious swine flu
 uske mukaable ibola kam sankramak he
 In a country with weak healthcare, one person will infect two, whereas in a strong system it spreads less than that
 ’’ ve kehete hai ki ummid yahi he ki bharat is par kaabo paa legaa
 "there is political awareness here
" swasthya mantri khud usamen ruchi le rahe hai
 Caution: Ebola is dangerous and expensive to treat
 aspataalon main bimaaron ke liye adhik bistar, marij kii dekhbhaal ke liye paryaapt swasthyakarmi, ilaaj kii suvidhaayen or marij kis-kis ke sampark main aa rahaa he, is par nigaraanee rakhane kii jarurat he
 The cost of treating an Ebola patient in the US is about $ 1,000 per hour
 vishwa bank ne chetaya he ki 2015 tak ibola mahamari se hone vaala aarthik nuksaan 32
 6 billion dollars
 dow
 Jha says, "not preparing to deal with Ebola will be more expensive
 ’’doctor ek or upaay bataate haih apni shareerik kshamta badhanaa
 Because this virus becomes fatal only by weakening the body's immunity
 sehatmand bhojan kiijie, paryaapt aaraam kiijie, bhojan main paushtik aahaar, taaje fal, vitamin si, di or zinc vagairah zyada len
 Eat less sweet
 sharaab, prasanskarit khaadya padaarth, vagairah kam khaaen
 Use garlic, turmeric, ginger, lemon in food
 yaad rakhen, bharat main lakhon log malaria, echivi, dast or tibi se mar rahe hai
 Ebola is new but less deadly than these

 He has appealed to Pakistani journalists to show news related to Kashmir on their channels for 25 minutes or five minutes or at least three minutes
 aatank ke aakaa makki ne kaha ki hamaare yahaan 85 channel aate hai
 On that we show our culture
 usne kaha ki culture to peeche rah gaya or ab kamabakht channelon par to nagin drama dikhaaya jaataa he
 He said that a drama called Naagin appears in Pakistani channels
 vah bhi ichhadhari nagin kaa drama
 Earlier the mother-in-law's drama used to play and now the serpent drama
 makki ne poocha 'acha yah bataao ki ichhadhari nagin ke drama ko dekhakar aap pakistan ke liye aap koun si khidamat kar rahe hai'
 Terrorist Makki said that at three o'clock the girl stood up and became a wishful serpent
 ab ham yah sab dikhaa rahe hai, jo ek drama ke andar sab kuch khatm ho gaya
 Now where do we go and say that the TV channels here give three to five minutes to Kashmir
 makki ne kaha ki express channel kahata tha ki har khabar par nazar he
 Our son got ready for the express crossing the border and went to the Kashmiris for help and was martyred there, but there was no news on the express and if the car gets hit a little, then the express gets a look
 usne kaha ki hamaare liye na to koi patrkaar nazar aata he or na hi badi-badi thaaliyon (dish) vaali gaadi nazar aati hai
 The terrorist said that Pakistan's rulers are not fit to be called rulers
 inhone hafiz said ko kaid kar liya he
 Makki said, 'I would like to tell you and i have no problem in telling you that Hafiz Saeed had announced in January that the year 2017 will be in the name of independence of Kashmir, but the khichdi which was cooking, it will be in 24 hours Was taken inside only
 hafiz said ko ghar main najarband kar diya gaya
 The foreign policy here was eliminated with a large blade
 madhya purv, madhya asia or kashmir ko lekar koi policy hi nahin he
 The reason for this is that we do not have any foreign minister
 kasam allaah kii sir jhuk jaataa he ki main us mulk kaa aadmi hu, jisaki na koi fahrren policy he, naa koi fahrren ministar
 Makki provoked Pakistani journalists and said that the people of Kashmir are looking towards Pakistan
 usne patrakaron se kaha ki ve asia andrabi, duktrani millat, mirwij ko yah kahe ki ve vahaan jis halaat main khadey ho, to ham bhi yahaan chaiyn se baithe nahin hai

 The case is from East Delhi where the body of a 22-year-old man was found on the railway track in 12 pieces
 gharavaale sidhaa ilzaam yuvak ke sasuraal waalon par laga rahe hai kyonki usne prem vivaah kiya tha
 Actually, the body of 22-year-old Paras Bhasin, who lives in Minakshi Garden, Tilaknagar, has been recovered from the Ganesh Nagar railway trek in 12 pieces
 paras ke gharavaalon kaa aarope he ki unke bete ko juthi shaan ke naam par katl kiya gaya he
 According to family members, Paras married a girl in May this year in the Arya Samaj temple, which the girl told her family members when she started marrying him elsewhere
 paras ke gharavaalon kaa aarope he ki iske baad se hi ladki ke gharavaalo ne ladki ko ghar main bandhak bana liya or paras ko apni beti se dur rahane kii hiyaayat dekar use jaan se maarane kii dhamkee tak de daali
 According to the family members of Paras, on Saturday, a caller from an unknown number had told that Paras has died and his body was lying on the railway track of Ganesh Nagar
 khabar sunakar ghabaraaye parijan fouran us jagah pahunche to unke hosh ud gayi
 The family members are calling the death of Paras as murder because the police had not informed them about Paras's death
 balki kisi anjaan shaks ne di thi
 While Paras's corpse had neither his wallet nor mobile phone
 aise main us anjaan collar ko ye kaise pataa chalaa ki marane vaala paras hi he
 Not only this, the police had also not recovered part of his head from the body of Paras
 haalaakin is maamle main ladki kii maa kaa kahana he donon kii shaadi ke bare main bhi unako kuch pataa nahin he
 The family also alleges that the girl's family members are influential, so the police is trying to postpone the case
 vahiin police kaa kahana he ki paras ke sir kaa hissaa baraamad kar liya gaya he or ab tak kii jaanch ke baad police ise susid kaa maamla maan rahi he
 And that is why the police have not registered a case of murder in this case so far
 vahiin police kaa kahana he ki maamle kii jaanch kii ja rahi he
 But the family members of Paras are adamant that they will take the corpse only when a case is registered
 jaahir he ki jis tarah se paras kii laash mili he usase ye sawaal uthanaa laazmi he ki kya ye mahaj ek haadasa he yaa susid yaa phir ek sochi samajhi sajeesh kaa anjaam
 At present, the answer will be found only after investigation
