 dilli main garajane vaale anna hajaare, aaj bihar main raily kar rahe hai
 Anna Hazare has gone on to write a new chapter of his revolution from Gandhi and jp's workplace
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf deshbhar main alakh jagaai vaale anna ab andolan kaa doosraa adhyay likhane ja rahe hai
 Till now, Anna, who has filled Janlokpal's chorus in Delhi and Mumbai, has chosen the land of Bihar to start the movement again
 anna buudhvaar ko patna main raily kar rahe hai
 After which Anna will awaken Janlokpal's fame all over the country
 yani jis bihar kii dharti ne mahatma gandhi or jepi ke andolanon ko nae tevar die the, anna bhi vahiin se apni aawaaj buland karenge
 When Gandhiji started the movement from Champaran in Bihar and forced the British to leave Hindustan while weaponizing non-violence, JP shook the throne of Delhi by giving the slogan of complete revolution from this Bihar
 anna bhi isiilie patna ke usee aitihaasik gandhi maidan main janatantr raily kar rahe hai
 Anna Hazare has seen the fate of Janlokpal's movement once, hence Anna has chosen Gandhi ji's Martyrdom Day for a rally to start from Patna
 saath hi jepi nivas main thaharne kaa faisla kar khud ko gandhi or jepi kii viraasat se jodne kii koshish kii he
 Janlokpal is the new chapter of the movement
 to anna ke kuch saathi bhi nae hai
 This time with Anna some new faces will also join the rally
 patna kii raily main purv senadhyaksh wike singh, samajasevi medha patkar or kiran bedi ke bhi shaamil hone kii ummid he
 With renewed vigor and renewed vigor, Anna Hazare is again raising the bar against corruption, with the hope that a wave like the August revolution at Ramlila Maidan on August 16 will once again arise
 is andolan main sirf janalokapal kii baat nahin hogi
 Rather, Anna is talking about changing the system with corruption
 kehete hai insaan ke sapane dekhne or unako puraa karne kii koi umr nahin hoti
 Those who say this tell the truth
 apni puri jindagi ham kisi sapane ko lekar jite hai or apane sapanom ko puraa karne kii jimmedaari aapke apane kandhon par hoti he
 The other can help you but can't make them come true for you, can't live
 or jo insaan apane chaah ko puraa karne kii thaan le use phir koi roak nahin saktaa
 Such is the story of dreaming, showing and then making them come true, the shooters Dadri, Chandro and Prakashi Tomar of Johri village in Baghpat, UP
 bahadur hote hai wo log jo kuch kar dikhaane kaa jajba rakhte hai or misaal kaayam karte hai
 The life story of shooter Dadis is also no less than an example for our countrymen and there can hardly be anything more for both Tapsee Pannu and Bhoomi Pednekar's film Bull's Eye Tribute
 kya he film kii kahani?bagpat ke johar gaanv main sthit ye kahani he tomars parivaar kii bahu chandro or prakaashi tomars kii, jo apni jindagi main ghar kaa kaam karne, khaanaa pakaane, apane pati kii seva karne, khet jotane or bhatti main kaam karne ke alaava zyada kuch khaas kar nahin pain
 Her husband blows hookah all day and talks big
 jindagi ke 60 saal aise hi jivan nikaal dene ek baad chandro or prakaashi ko achaanak se apane shooting tallent kaa pataa chalata he
 But dreaming of becoming a shooter, these two grandmothers face thousands of challenges, not one or two
 inamen se sabase badi he shooting kii training lenaa or usase bhi badi he toornament main jaakar khelnaa
 How the women who have never left their house without any men, not only fulfilled their dreams but also inspired the women of the rest of the country to do it, this is shown in this film
 shooter daadi kii kahani aapane bahut se akhabaaron main padhi hogi, bahut se sho yaa news main dekhi hogi
 But through the eyes of Taapsee Pannu and Bhumi Pednekar's film Sand, you have won the story of these two Dadis
 is film main ek nahin bahut si acchhee bate hai
 But if you want to keep something on top, then i will keep the performance of the actors
 is film main badhiya actors ko liya gaya he or bahut soch samajhakar liya gaya he
 You will understand this in the beginning of the film
 chandro tomars ke role membhumi pednekaraur prakaashi tomars ke role main taapasi pannu kii jitani tarif kii jaae kam he
 Both of these actresses have shown great work
 parde par jab donon saath main hoti hai, to aap unka kaam dekhakar man hi man unki daad de rahaa hota he
 There are many scenes in which the acting of both is better than the other
 lekin sabase badi baat ye he ki donon kii chemistry itani laajawab he ki donon ek-duusare ke saath feet baithti hai
 We have seen Bhumi Pednekar in many indigenous avatars
 aise kirdaar nibhaana maano unki khaasiyat he or is baar bhi unhone bemisaal kaam kiya he
 At the same time, i do not think that any such role has been made, which Taapsee Pannu cannot play
 film kii saporting cast bahut solid he
 The work of actors including Prakash Jha, Vineet Kumar Singh, Pawan Chopra is excellent
 prakaash jha jab bhi parde par aate hai, har seen, frem sabakuch apane naam kar lete hai
 Director Tusshar Hiranandani has made this film very well
 film aapako pehle seen se apane saath baandh leti he or phir aap uske saath chalate jate hai
 Its editing is very crisp and not once do you feel that it is slow or is losing its point somewhere
 pehle seen se lekar aakhri seen tak aap apni seat par jame rahete hai or prakaashi or chandro kii jindagi ko jite or mahasoos karte rahete hai
 This film is filled with different emotions and by the end, tears are coming out of your eyes
 film kaa becoground or gane bahut achche hai, jinpar aapkaa man thirakane ko jarur karata he
 The only thing that can knock you is the make up of Tapasi and Bhoomi
 uske alaava choti-moti kamiyaan aap aaraam se nazarandaaj kar sakate hai
 Overall, you must definitely watch the film Bull's Eye, because it is a full-fledged money film, which teaches you great things

 1 agast 1953 ko indian airlines (abhi elliance air) kii shuruyaat hui thi
 The Indian Airlines Company was formed by merging the 7 pre-independence regional companies Deccan Airways, Airways India, Bharat Airways, Himalayan Aviation, Kalinga Airlines, Indian National Airways and Air Services of India
 shuruaati laagat thi 3
 20 crores rupees
 us samay indian airlines ke paas 99 vimaan the
 74 Douglas DC-3 Dakota, 12 Vicars Vikings, 3 Douglas DC-4C and some smaller aircraft
 lekin ye saare vimaan videshi companiyon ne banaae the
 Indian Airlines got its first indigenous passenger aircraft 52 years ago on 27 June 1967
 iskaa naam AVRO hoker sidli eches-748 tha
 It was formed by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and British company AVRO
 yah aaj ke atiar vimaan se thodaa hi chota tha
 Earlier it was built for the army of different countries but after 1957 it was converted into passenger aircraft
 isamen 40 se 48 logon ke baithne kii vyavastha thi
 When the aircraft started manufacturing in India, it was renamed HAL-748
 hindustan aironautics ne 89 vimaan banaae the
 72 for the Indian Air Force and 17 for the Indian Airlines
 HAL-748 vimaan ke desh main haadase9 disambar 1971 - jab yah vimaan madurai utarane kii taiyaari main tha tabhi chinnamannaur ke paas drishyata kam hone kii vajah se haadasagrast ho gaya tha
 In this, 4 crew members and 17 passengers were killed
 lekin, 10 log batch gaye the
 19 August 1981 - Indian Airlines number 557 was moved past the runway of mangalore-bajpe Airport
 kyonki ranve geela tha
 There were no casualties in this incident

 Indian Airlines services 64 and 16 locations in the country
 Indian Airlines flies to 64 locations in India and 16 locations abroad
 pratidin 35,000 siten uplabdh karaata he
 It is the largest airline company in India
 videshon main indian airlines nimnlikhit sthanon ke liye udaan bharti hai
 How is the condition of Indian Airlines now? If we consider the May 2019 report of the Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the official flight of the country is still Indian Airlines
 2019 ke pehle chah maheenon kii baat karen to desh kii kul udaanon main se 13
 2 per cent of the flights are by Indian Airlines
 baaki kai nijee companiyaan milakar sevaayen de rahi hai
 Still in the field of domestic aviation, Alliance Air ie Indian Airlines 31
 73 fisadi share ke saath tisare number par he
 There is Indigo on the first and Spice Jet on the second
 DGCA kii may 2019 kii report ke anusaar ab bhi desh main yatriyon ko unke gantavy tak pahunchane ke maamle main indian airlines (85%) paanchaven number par he
 First Spice Jet (93
 9%), doosraa go air (93
 3%), third indigo (90
 0%) or chauthaa air asia (87

 gharelu udaanon ke tikat radd hone ke maamle main bhi indian airlines paanchaven number par hai
 Earlier, there are Air Deccan, Pawan Hans, Star Air and Trujet

 Premium charges apply !! centre sarkaar dwaara dilli kii aniyamit coloniyon ko niyamit karne ke elaan ke baad siem arvind kejariwal (arvind Kejriwal) ne kaha ki ham is faisle kaa swaagat karte hai
 We had been fighting it for a long time
 iske liye centre sarkaar kaa shukriya adaa karte hai
 He said that we had sent the proposal in 2015 and were in constant touch with the central government
 24 july 2019 ko draft par apane suzav die the
 Although we do not have all the details right now, we will tell you when we come
 ab agederi naa ho, aage ke kadam bhi jald uthaaye jaaen
 Only when the registry comes in hand will people believe that the colony is confirmed
 hamane niyamit hone kaa intazaar kiye bina 5 saal main 6 hazaar karod in colony main nivesh kiya
 Water, sewer, road drains are built
 aapako bataa den kicendre sarkaar ne diwaali se thik pehle dilli (delhi) kii aniyamit coloniyon ke nivaasiyon ko bada tohfa dene kaa nirnay liya he
 The Union Cabinet has decided to regularize irregular colonies of Delhi
 dilli main kul 1797 aniyamit colony hai
 This decision of the government will benefit about 40 lakh people living in these colonies
 haalanki teen coloniyaan niyamit nahin hongi
 This includes Sainik Farms, Mahendru Enclave and Anantharam Dairy
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ye aniyamit coloniansarkari jameen, kheti kii jameen or gram sabha kii jameen par bani hai
 While regularizing the colonies, some percentage of the circle rate will be taken as regular reserving fee
 film 'kil dil' ko diarect kiya he, shaad ali ne
 Shad has previously made films like 'saathiya', 'bunty Aur Babli' and 'jhoom Barabar Jhoom'
 'jhum baraabar jhum dekh' darshak jhum nahin paae the or mujhe lagata he 'kil dil' se bhi darshak dil nahin laga paaenge
 The story of the film is of Dev and Tutu (ranbir Singh and Ali), who are the two important players of Bhaiyya ji
 bhaiya ji logon ko maarane kii supaari lete hai, jise anjaam tak pahunchaate hai, tutu or dev
 Govinda will be seen here in the role of Bhaiya Ji, who is returning to the big screen after almost 4 years
 kahani main mode tab aata he, jab dev disha yani pariniti ko dil de baithta he or dil ke haathon majaboor hokar dev logon ko na maarane kaa man bana letaa he, par bhaiya ji ko dil kaa maamla samaj nahin aata
 You will have to watch the film to know the rest of the game of 'kill and Dil'
 mujhe lagata he ki shaayad gunde ke baad ranvir, shaad ali or nirmaataa ko kuch vakt kaa brake lenaa chahie tha
 The biggest drawback of this film is its story, which ends in a single line
 kahani main nayaapan nahin he
 a line storyline has been drawn, which made the film ineffective
 ye sabhi jaanate hai ki govinda achche dancer or kamaal ke actor hai, par 'kil dil' main mujhe govinda kaa kirdaar adhpaka laga
 Viewers may be forced to think that what is their character after all and why? Ranveer Singh's energy and honesty in acting hides many of the film's shortcomings
 ali or pariniti bas film main hai or thik hai
 What i liked is the music of the film, which is credited to the writing of Shankar Ehsaan Loy as well as Gulzar Saheb
 unki aawaaj main shaayari lubhaati he, par afsos yah film kii kahani main piroi nahin gai he
 'kill Dil' failed to meet my expectations

 Ishwar Bhai Desai has asked US President Obama how long the US will be able to make Pakistan realize that its policy of promoting cross-border terrorism policy against India will have to bear the consequences
 jabaki shrinidhi ne poocha he ki koi bhi desh jab aatankwaad se akele nahin lard paa rahaa he to antarrashtriya antakawaad se nipatane ke liye alag-alag desh saajha hokar ekajutata se iske khilaaf pahal kyon nahin kar rahe hai

 With this decision, both the government and media have started calling it their victory and are also targeting India
 videsh mantralay ne bataaya apni jeetahar maukey par masood ajahar ko bachaane vaala pakistan UN ke faisle ko bharat kii jeet nahin maan rahaa he

 Jha also considered this matter but in strong words
 vidaai ke maukey par unhone kaha, ''jis tarah vaajapeyi ji ne pokharan visphot kii bhanak kisi ko nahin lagane di, usee tarah shivaraj singh chouhan ne narendra singh tomars ko adhyaksh banane ke faisle kii khabar kisi ko nahin hone di
 With this, it became clear that the claims of everything being normal between him and Chauhan were hollow
 haalanki mukhyamantri ne yah kahkar apana bachaav kiya ki, ''sanghathan ke kaam main maine kabhi hastkshep nahin kiya
 i do not even know who is becoming the district and division president in my home district
 ''darasal jha ke kaamkaaj ke tareeke ko lekar chouhan khush nahin the, unki pradesh sanghathan ke mahasachiv arvind menon se bhi nahin patati thi

 This time too, he has stated his intentions
 tomars ne kaha he, ''mere pair hameshaa jameen par rahete hai
 i do not take any decision in over-enthusiasm
 ab mishan 2013 main jute rahaa hum
 According to political analyst Girija Shankar, the main reason for Jha's withdrawal is that he could not increase his acceptance within the party

 Assembly elections in Odisha are due after two years, but the Bharatiya Janata Party has already started preparations for an electoral victory in the state
 bhaajapa kii do divasiy rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak yahaan shuru hui he
 The party achieved good success in the recent local bodies and panchayat elections
 iske baad party ne apana jor ab rajya kii satta main aane par laga diya he
 BJP has been a partner in the state's power for 9 years
 In 1998, the BJP national executive met here
 iske baad bhaajapa ne rajya main biju janata dal se haath milaayaa tha
 BJD also joined the NDA government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee at the Center in 1998
 baad main odisha main bhi bijedy or bijepi ne milakar sarkaar banaai
 Then differences arose between the two and the BJD severed ties with the NDA
 iske baad se bhaajapa rajya main apane vistaar ke liye puraa jor laga rahi he
 Although the BJP was part of the BJD government for nine years from the year 2000, but during this time the BJP failed to establish its roots there, the BJP always remained as an ally
 panchayat chunaavon main shandaar pradarshan se jaagi ummiden2014 ko loksabhaa chunaav main modi lahar ke baavjood bhaajapa rajya main keval ek seat jeet saki thi
 Though Odisha assembly elections are due in the year 2019, but BJP wants to fully capitalize on the better performance in local elections
 bijepi ne odisha ke panchayat chunaavon main shandaar pradarshan kiya he
 While the BJP managed to win only 36 seats out of 851 in the 2012 panchayat elections, it won 306 seats in the 2017 elections
 bijepi ke liye utsahit karne vaali baat ye bhi he ki party sthaneey nikaay chunaavon main biju janata dal ke garh main send lagane main kaamyaab rahi he, or saath hi saath congress ko bhi tisare sthaan par dhakelne main kaamyaab rahi he
 Currently, the Bharatiya Janata Party has only one MP in Odisha, while the party has only 10 mlas
 amit shah har maheene aaenge rajya mesub jab vartmaan samay main bijepi ke liye odisha se achche parinaam aaye hai, to bijepi kaa aglaa lakshya odisha ke vidhansabha or loksabhaa chunaavon main behatar pradarshan kaa he
 For this, the party is also working on a special strategy, under which Amit Shah will spend at least three days every month in different parts of the state till the next election
 iske alaava petroleum mantri dharmendra pradhan samet kuch varisht netaa bhi agle chunaav tak odisha main apana puraa jor lagaate najar aaenge jisase aane vaale samay main odisha main bhi bhartiya janata party kii sarkaar satta main aa sake
 Mission will be important role in 2019 The BJP government is present in 13 states and the party is trying to increase this figure continuously
 odisha main vidhansabha chunaav 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke saath hi hone hai
 In such a situation, the party is not only eyeing the power of the state, but they have also expected to perform well in the state in the Lok Sabha elections

 loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon ne india today – exis maai india ke eczit pole ke nateezon par muhar laga thi
 The results of Punjab, Himachal and Chandigarh proved to be accurate
 haryana ke bhi nattejey kareeb kareeb sahi rahe haalanki aakhri nateezon main thodaa ulat pher rahaa
 In the exit poll, we had told that BJP will prevail in the elections and former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda is sure to lose to Sonepat but we gave two seats to Congress
 congress ek bhi seat jeetne main kaamyaab nahin hui
 The BJP won all 10 seats in the state and remained extremely close to the exit poll results
 india today exis maai india ke eczit pole ne punjab main congress ko 8 se 9, bijepi akali gathbandhan ko 3-5 or aam aadmi party ko 1 seat diya tha
 In the results, Akali BJP got 4 seats, AAP got 1 seat and Congress managed to win 8 seats
 aakhir bijepi sirf 1 hi seat kyon jeet pai yaa akalidal 10 main se 8 siten kyon haar gai to jawaab he akali sarkaar ke khilaaf logon kaa gussa
 The public had rejected the Akali Dal in the last elections which ruled Punjab for 10 years
 bijepi ko bhi isi gathbandhan kaa khamiyaja uthaanaa padaa or captain amarinder ne modi lahar ko punjab main ghusane nahin diya
 Another reason may be that the people of Punjab are not interested in spoiling relations with Pakistan because Kartarpur, the religious site of Sikhs, is there and the work of Kartarpur Corridor may get stuck due to stress
 vaise hi himachal ke bare main ajtak maai exis india kaa eczit pole bilkul sateek sabit hua hamane bataaya tha ki vahaan bijepi sari siten jitkar clin sweep karegi, vahiin chandigarh loksabhaa seat ke liye hamane bataaya tha ki muqabla kadaa hoga
 The BJP justified our poll by winning all the seats in Himachal, where the voters voted on the issue of national security as most of the Himachal families join the army
 haalanki eczit pole main ham janata kaa mood bhaanpane main kaamyaab rahe
 We had said that BJP will perform strongly in Haryana and Hooda will lose the election as well
 hamane ye bhi kaha tha ki punjab main bijepi ko akaliyon kaa saath mahangaa padegaa nattejey bhi kuch aise hi aae

 manavir ke baad Bigg Boss main aayega ek or gurjar boy, aise hogi entribtaa den ki yah pehla maamla nahin he jab pakistan main kisi mahila kalakaar par jaanaleva hamalaa kiya gaya he
 This is the 15th such case reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa this year
 isi tarah ke ek hamale main stage actress sumbul kii 3 farvari ko maut ho gai thi
 Karni Army
 ye naam to aapako yaad hi hoga
 Karni Sena made a lot of noise at the time of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film 'padmavat'
 karani sena kaa kahana tha kii sanjay lila bhansaali kii ye film rajputon kii bhaawanaao ko aahaat karti he
 There was a lot of ruckus about this and protests against 'padmavat' were also organized
 virodh pradarshan hue to maamle bhi darj hue or karani sena ke logo ko hiraasat main lene se lekar jail tak bheja gaya
 Finally the film was released, the film performed well at the box office despite all the protests
 lekin ab karani sena ek baar phir charchaa main he
 Actually, the reason for Karni Sena to come up in the discussion is the Tourism Minister of Maharashtra Jayakumar Rawal
 bataa den ki jayakumar rawal ne maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ko ek letters likhaa he or is letters main unhone karani sena ke khilaaf film padmavat ke dauraan maharashtra bhar main darj hue sabhi maamlo ko waapas lene kii maang kii he
 According to this letter by Jayakumar Rawal, many cases were registered during the Padmavat protests against the Karni army and no damage was done by the Karni army anywhere
 aise main karani sena par darj sabhi maamle waapas liye jane chahie
 On the other hand, when Aaj Tak's team talked to Suran Pal Singh Ammu of Karni Sena on this matter, they said that more than 700 cases have been registered against Karni Sena across the country and more than 200 cases only
 It is registered only in Maharashtra
 aise main in sabhi maamlo ko waapas lenaa chahie or agar aisa nahin kiya gaya to aanevaale chunaavo ke dauraan ham virodh pradarshan karenge
 Now it will be really interesting to see what the Chief Minister of Maharashtra does on this demand of Jayakumar Rawal and Karni Sena

 People know my blog and they like my work
 mujhe khushi he ki maine khud par or bloging par bharosa rakhaa

 From the Garhwal University, doing research on the topic 'yugbodha in Sixty-one Hindi satirical literature', Dr
 Adhikari, who adopted the satirical genre with poetry and essay
 lalit kishor mandora vaise to rashtriya pustak nyaas bharat main hindi ke sahaayak sampadak ke taur par pustak samskruti or sahitya kii gatividhiyon se jude hai par lagaataar likhane-padhane main unka muqabla mushkil
 Satire writes daily, and also appears in some regional newspapers
 unka sahityak naam laalitya lalit he
 During the Delhi World Book Fair this year, several of his satirical collections were printed simultaneously
 unki charchit pustakon main gaanv kaa khat, shahar ke naam, diwaar par tangi tasviren, yani jeena sikh liya, talashte log, intjaar karata ghar, chulhaa udhaas he shaamil he
 a satire written for the readers of Sahitya Aajtak on his latest satire compilation 'pandey Ji and Dillagi' on Me Too
 ***vyangyapandeya ji or lapkuram kaa me tu- laalitya lalitjab se khabar ai he ki me tu muhim ke tahat kai logon kii dukaane khulne lagi he, to lage haath lapkuram bhi ghabaraane lage hai
 Because in youth, we have played big flutes, whose threat will now erupt
 media main bhi kya se kya khabar aa rahi he!ek baar to lagata he ki kya yah locha hoga bhi!kya saare ke saare purush samaaj ko ganda kar rahe hai!kya mahilaon ne unhen rokane ke liye koi bhi kadam nahin uthaaya
 Only an animal can do this bestiality
 aadhe se zyada shaadi shuda log itani ghinoni harakatein karne par amada!chilman ne kaha ki ustad ji, maine aapse pehle hi kaha tha ki aaj ke jamaane main bhi lapkuram kaa mobile bill hajaaron main aata he!kaaiyaan aadmi he
 When you see a soft smile, such men should be avoided
 dusht pravriti ke hote hai, apane to sage hone se rahen
 Where you look, you will be seen smiling
 oh!aise log!kahan se aae is janm main!dharti par logon kaa rahanaa kathin ho gaya
 Radhelal is silent on this matter
 pandeya ji ko pataa he ki kab bolnaa he unako or ve maukey kii talash main honge ki jab samay aayega, tab ve bolenge!aakhir ye loktantr he baba! jahaan log jaanate hai ki kab ullu sidhaa karnaa he or kab ungliyaan tedi kerani he
 At the World Hindi Conference, it was not even cold that now the cry of Me Too has come out loud and laughter
 lekin kisi ko bhi ghabaraane kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin he, kuch din main yah mudda thande baste main chalaa jayega or isaki jagah koi or nayaa mudda aa jaayegaa
 Anyway, we Indians have a very poor memory
 aksar bade-bade mudde bhul jate hai yaa bhula die jate hai
 Then disgruntled Kumar said, Pandey ji
 kabhi hamaare saath bhi chaay pi lijiye, hujur!pandeya ji ko laga ki aaj ye janaab zarurat se zyada khush hai, sochaa aglaa kah rahaa he to pi lete hai
 While sitting, Kumar Sahib showed a picture on mobile and said that this is the picture of the play written by me, Pandey ji was very surprised that you also write the play! Congratulations, brother, we did not know this
 par asantusht kumaar apane kaksh main chupchaap sahitya rachane waalon main ek hai
 Do not say anything to anyone, just continue in your work
 aise log kam hai apni dharti par, jinaki badaulat duniya kaa sansar chal rahaa he
 The news came from somewhere that the mind has slipped, the mind has slipped
 is chakkar main kai log aise bhi hai jo ve karen to sab thik, par unke parivaar ke log karen to vah galat
 Due to this, he has forbidden his family to come on social media
 lekin abhasith duniya main ve gulchharre udaate rahe, is baat kaa unhen koi malaal nahin
 Lapkuram once played English songs on the guitar
 is chakkar main kai mahilaayein aakarshith ho gayi
 Now, if you have the talent to make things, then the line of what is black and what is white will be centered on you
 is maamle main lapkuram shuru se kukhyat kisim ke jeev rahe hai
 said that i do not understand what people get behind women ! Ramay Pandey remembers the day when he went to Raipur for some work and the great poet of the country stayed in his hotel, when someone told a local poet that such poets had come, Waiting for you and the poet was told something similar
 pandeya ji kya dekhte he ki falaane kavi ji lagbhag daudte hue vahaan pahunche jaise kisi madhubala se milane ke liye bageeche main dilip kumaar ne lagbhag daud hi laga di hon ki priytama!kya aaj bhi tum mujh se itnaa sneh karti ho!vah kavyitri sharmaai ki kitne bade kavi ne mere liye daud lagaayee
 By the way, what male species of poets continue to run for women
 aajkal jo me tu kaa prasang chal rahaa he, vah lagbhag vaise hi he ki maranaa to sab ne he
 Of course, whether you have sugar or not, if you do not get caught in a fight, then you have a damn on the male caste, get stuck son, come to the discussion and earn some name baaki to dekhne ke liye bahuterey hai
 There are many such stories in literature which are still trying to come in lime light
 unka machalanaa bhi jaij he
 Our country is progressing in such an environment that when we are interested to see the progress of illegitimate relations
 bai da ve! main maayke ja rahi hoon, kaam vaali se kaam karvaa lenaa, aksar is tarah ke vaakya hawa main tairaa karte the, ab patniyaan saavdhaan ho gai hai ki kya pataa kab koun si sevika me tu ke chakkar main sahab ko fansaa de or kuch aniatik kamai kaa sorce banavaa le
 Nowadays there is no trust in anyone
 udhar yah khabar ai he ki bhabhi ji ghar par hai ki purv heroin shilpa scindia ne kaha he ki yadi donon main aam sahmati se koi sambandh banataa he to vah rape kii ketegiri main nahin aata
 Here, Ramkhelavan said that what is the time, immoral relationship! Iniquity thrives! Who knows where to go and what to do! What will happen to India! Its global image! When Pandey Ji said that Radhe Lal and Ramlubhaya cannot handle this image, what are you and us sons! Go to Chilman's sister-in-law and get the radish peeled, today i want to eat radish and also bring some red salt
 gas khul kar aati he
 It is said that internal cleaning should also be done from time to time
 chilman ne kaha ki baat to sahi he
 He ran and gave the peeled soft beans with salt and ran away
 use pataa tha ki jab pandeya ji gas chhodte he to uski dhamak do kilometre tak pahunchati he, yah baat ramkhelavan ko nahin pataa thim
 Ramkhelavan, which happened that day, did not leave the house for a week
 kisi ne puch bhi liya to kehane laga ki upi main parali ke chalate nikalnaa sambhav nahin
 Lallu did not come today
 pandeya ji bhul baithe the ki use to aaj kisi seminar main janaa tha
 Anyway, the excuse of a seminar is a pleasant affair when there is no work to be done and you have to enjoy the holidays, which there is no harm in trying it occasionally
 dayaal babu mast hai
 Drink tea with Pandey ji
 vaise unako sugar he, lekin kehete hai ki halki mithi chaay kahan nuksaan karti he!madhubala ne kaha ki ye jitne bhi buudhe kisim kii ghaagh prajati ke log hai ye maanane vaale kahan hai!kya kha kar maanenge!kahan jaaenge!lagata he narak main bhi jagah nahin milane vaali
 Everyone nodded in agreement
 iske kaaran or daihik upadeyata ke vimarsh ko lekar ansudhanvetta lagaataar vimarsh kar rahe hai ki vishay ko lekar kitna vimarsh abhi or baaki he!chintan ne shesh logon ko bhi chaitanya bana diya he, unka sochna lagaataar jari he ki vishay ko or kitna praasangik banaaya jaae taaki vishay kii sthapana sucharu rup se vyavasthit kii ja saken
 Radhelal ji approached Ramlubhaya and bowed his head before the establishment of Ramlubhaya
 vah isliye jo vidwaan hoga uski manyata bhi maani jaaegi, jamaana uskaa sammaan bhi karegaa
 Lapkuram's heartbeat is increasing that if someone opens the distinction, then the respect that he has created in old age will be washed away and slander will be different
 udhar dabe swar main attu ne kaha ki izzat hogi tab na bachegi, ye vahi aadmi he na jisane hindi sammelan ke bahaane apni rotiyaan senki
 Such men are not made for any work, nor for literature, you can say Jugaadu, but brother, how long will this jugaad system last! Everyone knows the reality of it
 ab dukaan khulne main der nahin
 Atu said and went to get milk
 udhar pandeya ne suna to use aashcharya bhi hua ki attu ne jo kaha vah baat to thik he, lekin unhen ummid nahin thim ki attu bhi kaam kii baat kah sakegaa
 But whatever is filled from within, brother, whatever he says, he will say it from the heart
 ab to upar vaale bhi samaj gaye, ki is baar to pagal bana diya lekin har baar nahin banenge
 On the other hand, the one whom he embraced made up his mind to release the act of Lapakuram
 press club kaa haal book karvaa diya
 Some channels were also shocked by this news, the woman whom Lapkuram used to shout everywhere, is desperate to open his black letter today
 jab khabarilaal ne kureda to andar se khabar ye lageen ki lapkuram ne usko vishwa hindi sammelan main le chalane kaa vaayada kiya tha or iske evaj main motaa maal bhi bana liya
 Blessed are Lapkuram! Blessed is the society and blessed is the evils and policies of the society! Where will our India and its activities go
 baharhaal lapkuram kisi agyaat sthaan par laapata bataaen gaye hai
 Press talks postponed
 vah mahila aakhri baar lapkuram ke saath dekhi gai
 Radhelal refused to say anything
 sahitya samaaj sakate main ki yah hua kya!ab baaten jo saamne aane lageen vah is prakaar:kya lapkuram kisi shadyantr kaa shikaar hue?kya lapkuram ne us mahila kaa shoshan kiya!kya koi or vajah!baton ke kayaas jari hai
 Next let us see whether it comes to mind
 bane rahiye hamaare saath
 We take a commercial break! Pandey said: Hey, listen, cook, today even the news is no longer there
 kya jamaana aa gaya
 In the morning, Mr
 Kapoor got up and said that he found something in the corner Minocha! Pandeyji said, "no! Are you coming to the cabbage? Oh no! Yesterday we cleaned the park, slept and slept
" atake aayaa tha
 Went to the hospital but went on the way
 sabase acchhee maut yahi he, kisi ko tang nahin kiya
 Pandey ji said - what has been written has been happening, there me! Attack here! What a strange situation! Being strong and keeping an account of your actions, you have no power to change it, nor do we have it! kuch bhumigat ho gaye, lekin unke prasang sade paneer ke bulbule kii manind baahar nikalne ko utsuk hi nahin vyakul bhi hai
 Blood pressure of Lapuram is increased
 unke cheleram khaase dukhi hai ki yadi inkaa bhed khulaa to ve bhi bemaut maare jaaenge!aakhir ve bhi to dukh sukh ke saathi jo thahren!pandeya ji ne narayan hari kaha or ghar ko chal diye
 The real happiness is in his four walls in the house, if you know all this, then the end of the two-to-one affair should end

 Initially, when talking about the history of Congress's Garha Agara parliamentary seat, it was once a Congress stronghold, but in the last two decades only the Bharatiya Janata Party or Samajwadi Party has won this seat
 1952 se lekar 1971 tak yahaan se congress ne jeet darj kii
 After the Emergency, Chaudhary Charan Singh's party Bharatiya Lok Dal won in the anti-congress wave in the country
 haalanki, uske baad hue lagaataar do chunaav 1980 or1984 main congress ne jeet ke saath vaapasi kii, lekin uske baad congress dobaaraa is seat par vaapasi nahin kar saki
 The Janata Dal occupied this seat in 1989
 90 ke dashak main ramalahar ke baad desh main hue lagaataar teen loksabhaa chunaav 1991, 1996 or 1998 main bhartiya janata party yahaan se jiti

 The employees of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) office at Rajnagar in Ghaziabad have decided to clean the office premises themselves from July 1
 imaarat ke 10 safaikarmi kaam chhodkar ja chuke hai
 The news of the scavenging condition of this public sector undertaking (PSU) had reached these scavengers
 BSNL ke karmchaaree karmveer nagar ne bataaya, 'agar jarurat hui to ham safaikarmi rakhenge or unhen apni jeb se bhugtan denge anyathaa khud hi safai kaa kaam karenge
 'BSNL has sent an emergency letter to the government demanding immediate intervention
 patr main kaha gaya he ki BSNL ke liye oparation jari rakhana yaa june ke 850 karod rupee ke selleri bill kii vyavastha karnaa kareeb-kareeb naammumkin ho gaya he
 The institute has pending responsibilities of around Rs 13,000 crore
 aise main iske bijness ko maujuuda str par banaae rakhana mushkil ho gaya he
 How did a profitable PSU collapse? BSNL crisis started two years ago, but this matter came to light in February 2019 when employees were not paid salaries
 upie ke kaarykaal main 2008-09 main pehali baar hua jab 3G spectrum ko nilaamee se pehle hi privet players ko aavantit kar diya gaya
 Despite this, the necessary equipment was not supplied until 2013
 BSNL ke ek aadesh ke mutabik, sanstan china nirmit upkaran kii aapurti nahin le saktaa, jisaki vajah se kai vilamb hue
 The head of a Delhi-based employees union attached to the institute said, "currently, bsnl's share of the mobile market is just 10%
 landline main ye hissedari 70% he
 The current liability of vendors on BSNL is Rs 6000 crore
 agar wo hamaara vetan nahin bhi dete hai, ham chaahate hai ki wo vendors kii dendaree ko chukaayen
 This telecom PSU was profitable till 2009
 2016-17 main iskaa ghaataa 4,793 karod rupee tha jo 2017-18 main badhkar 7,992 karod ho gaya
 Employees say that this deficit is due to policies of separate central governments (UPA and now NDA)
 karmchaariyon par kyon daalaa ja rahaa he aarthik boj?2000 se 2009 ke bich ye santhaan har saal kareeb 10,000 karod rupee kaa munafa kama rahaa tha
 At that time, the number of employees in BSNL was even more than 3 lakhs today
 abhi BSNL main kareeb dedh lakh karmchaaree hai
 NITI Aayog's proposal to shut down BSNL In 2016, NITI Aayog, considered a central government think tank, linked BSNL to loss-making psus
 ayog ne BSNL jaise khastahal santhaan ko durust karne kii jagah band karne kaa prastaav bhi diya
 Competitors are looking at the 5G spectrum auction
 vahiin, BSNL ko 4G ke liye jane se bhi vyavasthit dhang se alag rakhaa gaya, kyonki isse khajaane ko 14,000 karod kii laagat aati
 Employees say that comparing BSNL to private players is unfair
 jeeyo, vodaphone, airtel jaise privet players outsorcing model ko oparation ke liye apanaate hai
 At the same time, BSNL is a PSU where employees are full time
 santhaan ke paas fund kii kami se 20% towers kii bijli aapurti baadhit he
 There are some states like Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh where electricity is still being supplied
 pashchim bengal or tamilnadu main 500 BTS se zyada thap ho gaye hai
 The matter is stuck with the Department of Telecommunications for permission to loan
 sawaal ye he ki BSNL agar karj letaa he to uskaa bhugtan kaise karegaa
 The Department of Telecommunications (dot) is not allowing the institute to approach banks, as far as the revival package is concerned, the employees are waiting what steps the government takes to keep the day-to-day functioning of the PSU smooth
 
 ab dekhnaa he PSU main dobaaraa jaan foonkane ke liye dakhal detii he yaa ise ICU main waapas bhej detii he
 Hello, Ravish Kumar
 isliye nahin ki aaj ke din gandhi kii hatya hui thi, isliye nahin ki aaj bhi kai log is hatya ko jaays maanate hue ghoomte rahete hai, isliye bhi nahin ki hamane kabhi gandhi kii maut ko lekar gaharaa pashchaatap nahin kiya
 But because many of our neighborhoods, cities, bridges, statues, museums, schools, colleges and markets are built in the name of Gandhi
 unke liye to ham kam se kam gandhi ko yaad kar hi sakate hai, taaki gandhinagaron or gandhi chaukon kii praasangikta bachi rahe
 We may not have won Gandhi but could not live without him
 varna dilli police mukhyalay kii diwaar par gandhi kii tasviir kyon ukeri jaati
 Perhaps seeing Gandhi smiling on the wall from a distance will change someone's confidence in the police and the police's behavior towards him
 thanon or afasaron ke kamaron main gandhi kab na the
 In the Times of India, Joint Commissioner SK Gautam has said that this picture of Gandhi matches with the slogan 'peace, Service and Justice' of Delhi Police
 vaise bina gandhi ko soche shanti seva or nyaay kaa naaraa likhaa kaise gaya
 However, i liked the effort of Delhi Police
 kam se kam police mukhyalay dekhne main to pulisia nahin lagegaa
 Some people continue to kill Gandhi day and night, and some keep alive Gandhi day and night
 aaj mujhase milane ames ke teen yuva doctor aae
 Told that AIIMS and some doctor engineers of IIT are trying to save the poor students from the loot of coaching mafia
 in ladakon ne apane chote se prayaas main saadhaaran parivaar ke das ladakon ko mobile phone se koching dekar doctor bana diya he
 They want to do a lot more than that for communal harmony
 bataaya ki hamaare group main hindu, muslim, sikh, isai sab hai
 Kerala is also Orissa and UP
 ham dangon kii maansikta ke kilaaf ladanaa chaahate hai
 Asif, Rajiv and Ajay, like Amar Akbar Anthony, i dreamed of a beautiful Hindustan, i felt like Gandhi today
 pehali mulaaqaat thi magar prabhavit ho gaya
 Then read the article of Radha Bhatt, president of Gandhi Peace Foundation in Hindustan, and felt that you should tell
 radha likhti hai ki agast 2012 main assam ke kokarajhaar main hui bhayankar hinsa ke kaaran samaaj kaa har tabaka ek duusare se bhaybhit ho gaya
 Even today, congress-bjp becomes in Delhi's press conferences regarding this incident
 jab vahaan gandhivadiyon kii team gai to kokarajhaar ke bhay or ghor avishvaas ke maahaul main jaldi hi gandhi wo sahaara ban gaye jiske zariye kai samudaayon ko qareeb laayaa ja sakaa
 The Muslim royal Bodo Santhal all sat together and became fearless to each other
 tay hua ki ham padosiyon par hamalaa nahin karenge
 Children started going to school
 skool−collejon main bhi gandhi kii baat sunne ke liye aayojan kiye gaye
 The youth there started changing and forming groups started going to Sevagram and Aga Khan Palace Poona
 kai college skool or gaanvon main 2 oktober ko ahimsa diwas yuvaaon ne khud manaaya
 Gandhi has become the solution amid violence
 aajkal har duusare din dangon ko lekar bahes hoti he
 Sometimes you will see the faces speaking in this debate in close up
 kisi ke chehre par afsos nahin dikhegaa ki ham congress bijepi ke taur par fail hue to hue hi, lekin usase pehle ham ek samaaj ke taur par fail kyon hue
 Who said remember Gandhi only
 aakhir ye dal jo gandhi jayanti manaate hai aise mauko par gandhi ke sahare takaraav kam karne kyon nahin jate hai or aap inase ye sawaal kyon nahin poochhate hai
 One day Sudhir Kumar Tiwari came to meet me
 bataaya ki unki sanstha un nyayadhishon ke kasbe yaa zile kii adaalat main jaakar gandhi kii pratimaa lagaati he, jinhone eemaandaaree se seva kii he
 So that the lawyers and judges there will get inspiration
 aise samay main jab gandhi kii murtiyon kii praasangikta kisi nautanki se kam nahin samajhi jaati kisi kii unhii murtiyon main itani gahari aasthaa he
 It is not that Gandhi is not
 bhale raajnneetik dalon or satta pratishthanon main gandhi nazar nahin aate
 The BJP is aggressive about whether to fulfill the dream of ending the Congress this time, but they do not say that Gandhi also said that the Congress should be dissolved and become a Lok Sevak Sangh
 kya wo aisa karne ja rahe hai, kya wo isaki baat karte hai
 On the other side is the Congress which does not say what its governments did to Gandhi's ideals
 gandhi ek dhela ban gaye hai dalon ke bich
 Whomever he wishes, Gandhi picks up and kills him
 kabhi anna hazaare aa jate hai gandhi part tu ban kar, to koi arvind kejariwal gandhi topi par aam aadmi likhakar gandhi ke tareekon par chalane kaa daawa karne lagate hai
 Everybody feels that Gandhi means the worker leaders come with all kinds of caps
 jab mohalla sabha tak satta le jane kii baat hoti he to panchayaton ko adhikaar dene kii baat karne vaale ise nautanki kehane lagate hai
 Gandhi had said that decentralization of power and today's leaders say that at least governance
 sabake paas kisim kisim ke gandhi hai, bas gandhi nahin hai
 Can we or our political parties sincerely accept that Gandhi can be worshiped, but cannot follow his ideals
 kya koi dal apane ateet ke tamaam raakhon ko jhaad kar achaanak nae sire se gandhi par chalane ke liye prasthaan kar saktaa he
 Let's see Ravish Uwach

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday intervened in the midst of the debate on the Constitution Amendment Bill of 10 per cent reservation for the economically weaker general category, rejecting Congress's objections to the bill
 arun jetali ne kaha ki vipakshi dalon ke ghoshnaa patr main kai baar aarthik rup se kamjor varg ko aarakshan kii baat kahi gai he jo ki jumala thi
 Jaitley said that 10 percent reservation to the general category does not violate the 50 percent limit of reservation by the Supreme Court
 jetali ne kaha ki congress kah rahi he ki wo is bill se saidhantik rup se sahamat he lekin saamaanya varg ke garibon ke liye aarakshan ke kai baar prayaas hue lekin unke prayaas is rup main nahin the ki court main thahar pate
 Jaitley said this while referring to the notifications issued by the Narasimhav government and the laws made by the state governments from time to time for this
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki rajyon ne yaa to notification nikaala yaa saamaanya kanoon banaaya lekin uskaa adhikaar kaa sorce kya tha
 Source was article 15 and 16 but under it, socio-educational can give reservation to backward only
 jati is pichhadepan kaa paimaana maani gai
 Jaitley said that the Narasimhav government pulled out the 10 percent reservation for the general category, but there was no provision in the constitution
 isliye nyaaypalika ne use nahin sweekaara
 FM Arun Jaitley in Lok Sabha: This reservation bill ensures 'sabka saath, sabka vikas'
 It is a move for equality, will enable social upliftment

 com / eb81yk840k — ANI (@ANI) January 8, 2019 Arun Jaitley explained that the Supreme Court has imposed 50 percent limit only for caste based reservation
 iske liye tark ye tha ki saamaanya varg ke liye kam se kam 50 fisadi to chodi jaaen varna ek varg ko ubaarane ke liye duusare varg ke saath bhedbhaav ho jaataa
 In this sense, the current bill is not against the spirit behind the decision of the Supreme Court
 gauratlab he ki saamaanya varg ko aarthik aadhaar par 10 fisadi aarakshan dene ke liye sarkaar ne mangalvaar ko loksabhaa main sanshodhit bill pesh kiya
 During this, when Arun Jaitley attacked the Congress and the Left parties fiercely

 dilli main ek bakse se baraamad ladki kii laash kaa maamla police ne sulajhaa liya he
 The police have arrested the girl's killer
 jisane puraani ranjish ke chalate pehle ladki ke saath rape kiya or baad main use maut ke ghat utaar diya tha
 a suit of the accused's wife proved to be an important clue in this case
 jisaki vajah se police kaatil tak ja pahunchi
 The sensational incident was found in the box on June 28
 us din dilli police ko khabar mili thi ki bhajanpura ilaake ke ek naale main ek baksaa tair rahaa he
 On receipt of the information, the police reached the spot and when the box was pulled out and opened, a 13-year-old girl's body was found inside the box
 laash do-teen din puraani najar aa rahi thi
 Police were also in a hurry to find a dead body in a suitbox
 ladki kii shinaakht bhi nahin ho paa rahi thi
 That's when the police started investigating the matter
 laash ke saath police ko bakse se kisi mahila kaa suut bhi baraamad hua tha
 Which accidentally left the killer in the box with the corpse
 mahila kaa suut bana suragpulice ne usee suut ko ahm suraag maanakar aage kii tafteesh shuru kii
 Meanwhile, the girl was identified
 ab police ko kaatil kii talash thi
 But the police had only a woman's suit
 lihaaja police ne bhajanpura ilaake main ladki ke aas-paas rahane vaale sabhi gharon main us suut ko dikhaane or uski pahchaan karaane kaa faisla kiya
 The police reached the murderer from the suit and reached the police area and showed the suit to all the people from house to house
 isi dauraan ek mahila ne wo suut pahchaan liya
 The suit belonged to the wife of a man named Ibral
 jo aksar use pahana karti thi
 Police found in the investigation that the woman, whose suit was, lived immediately near the deceased's house
 police kaatil ke kareeb pahunch chuki thi
 From the murderer's house, the absconder immediately went to the house of the man named Ibral
 vahaan maujuud ibraal kii patni ne apane suut ko pahchaan liya
 But he did not know what the suit was doing to the girl's body
 wo hairaan pareshaan thi
 Ibral had been missing from home since the revelations
 pakadaa gaya katilapulice ko maamla samaj main aa rahaa tha
 Ibral's rule was revealed, but it was yet to be confirmed
 police ibraal kii talash main jute gai
 Now the entire focus of the police was on Ibral
 do din kii kadi mehnat ke baad police ne aakhirkaar ibraal ko giraftaar kar hi liya
 In the interrogation, Ibral continued to deny the incident before, but when the police showed strictness, he confessed his crime
 ibraal ne police ko poochtacha main bataaya ki wo kuch maah pehle hi mritka ke pados main rahane aayaa tha
 There was no one in his house on the day of the incident
 wo ghar main akelaa tha or sharaab ke nashe main chur tha
 Before the murder, the 13-year-old girl living in the neighborhood was going from outside her house
 tabhi achaanak ibraal ne ladki ko jabaran apane ghar main khinch liya or darwaja andar se band karke ladki ke saath balaatkaar kiya
 During this protest, he also assaulted the girl for protesting
 or rape kaa baad usne ladki komaut ke ghatutaar diya
 The corpse was hidden in the box, the body of the girl wanted to be located
 lihaaja usne ghar main rakhe ek bade bakse main ladki kii laash daal di
 During this time, he made a mistake that he forgot to leave a suit of his wife kept in the box
 jo ladki kii laash ke neeche dab gaya tha
 On the same night, Ibral saw the opportunity and dumped the box in a rivulet flowing in the area
 ranjish main kii vaardatlekin naale main gandagi or kooda hone kii vajah se baksaa bahane kii bajaay vahiin aasapaas tairta rahaa

 tabhi police ne ladki kii laash baraamad kii thi
 Ibral told police that his girl was in a tussle with the family
 jiske chalate usne is vaardaat ko anjaam de daalaa

 After the Supreme Court's decision, there has been an earthquake all over Pakistan
 pakistani siyasatdan or sainya adhikari sakate main hai
 Everyone has only one question in their mind
 ab bajva kaa kya hoga
 Pakistan Army Chief's term will not increase Pakistan's Supreme Court has suspended the decision of Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa to extend the term of three years to Pakistan
 naa sirf pakistani siyasatdan balki sainya adhikari bhi supreme court ke is faisle se sakate main hai
 Will Bajwa not get 'extension'? Actually, Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa is retiring on November 29
 magar unke ritairement se teen maheene pehle hi pakistani pradhanmantri imran khan ne ek adhisuchana jari kar bajva kaa kaarykaal 3 saal ke liye badha diya tha
 On 19 August 2019, the Prime Minister's Office had approved the extension of service of General Bajwa and its notification was also sent to President Dr Arif Alvi
 raashtrapati ne bhi is par hastakshar kar die the
 Struggling in the PAK with the decision of the Supreme Court, the Pakistani Supreme Court has made it clear by questioning the Imran government's decision that any notification on any extension of the term of the Chief of Army Staff, the completion of the current term of COAS i
e
 Chief of Army Staff
 Can only be released later
 jo 28 november 2019 ke baad hi mumkin he
 Supreme Court notice to Army Chief Bajwa, Reappointment of Chief of Army Staff in Pakistan is possible but extension cannot be done
 or isiilie supreme court ne general bajva ke kaarykaal vistaar kii adhisuchana ko nilambit kar diya he
 Along with this, the court has issued notices to all the parties including the Pakistan Army Chief
 court ke is faisle ke baad bajva kii kursi khatre main aa gai he
 That is, if the government wants to keep Bajwa as the army chief, then first he will have to wait for Bajwa to retire and after that he will be able to appoint him again

 Which cannot be called a majority decision
 general bajva pakistan sena pramukh ke pad se 29 november ko ritair ho rahe hai
 a three-member bench said that during a decree hearing, a three-member bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan said that only the President of Pakistan had the power to extend the tenure of the army chief

 While 14 members of the cabinet did not give any opinion on the absence of non-existence
 supreme court ke is faisle ko sena pramukh general qamar javed bajva or pradhanmantri imran khan ke liye jatke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 Bajwa's good relations with Imran It is believed that Prime Minister Imran Khan and General Qamar Javed Bajwa have very good relations and if the Supreme Court directs the removal of Bajwa then it will be disturbing for him
 general bajva november 2016 main pakistani sena ke pramukh bane the
 The then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif commanded the army in Bajwa's hands
 chunaav main bajva ne kii thi imran kii madad!ab sawaal ye he ki niyamon ko taak par rakhkar aakhir imran khan general bajva ke kaarykaal ko badhaane par kyon amada he
 To understand this, one has to return to the time of the Pakistani elections held last year, because the Bajwa, whose tangle is entangled today, starts with these elections
 jab tamaam siyaasi panditon kii bhavishyavaaniyon ko darkinar karke hue imran khan pakistan main apni sarkaar kaayam kii
