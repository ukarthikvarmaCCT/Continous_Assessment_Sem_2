 Mittal says to India Today, "the court has not given any new order and the old order will be complied with
" lekin ham logon ko aadhaar banavaane ke liye prerit kar rahe hai
 "what is the central government's central government is not in the mood to legalize the authority by bringing a bill in Parliament regarding the Aadhaar project until the Supreme Court compels it to do so
" lekin vah philhal maujuuda sthiti ko behaal rakhana chaahati he
 The petroleum minister refrained from commenting on the latest Supreme Court order
 lekin unhone kuch samay pehle india today se kaha tha, ''pehle ham desh kii sari aabaadi kaa digital masping kar len or phir sanvaidhanik manyata dene kii zarurat padi to use dekhenge
 "this careless attitude of the government causes confusion about the base
" mantralay ke adhikariyon kii daleel he ki jis tarah rashan lene ke liye rashan card jaruri he, videsh jane ke liye passport jaruri he, usee tarah jise bhi alpiji yaa anya skim ke tahat laabh chahie, use aadhaar banvaanaa hoga
 According to sources in the ministry, there is a need to make laws in terms of giving autonomy to UIDAI and other facilities, not to mandate Aadhaar
 isliye supreme court ke saamne jab july main sarkaar ko apana paksh rakhane kaa mauka milegaa to aadhaar kii vajah se hone vaale phaayde or licage ko rokane main mili kamyaabi ko vah tathyon ke saath daleelon ke rup main rakhegi
 In this, the Petroleum Ministry alone figures that there were 10 to 12 lakh people who used to take double benefit of gas subsidy, but after being linked to Aadhaar's unique number and bank account, they were caught through the IFSC code

 K
 mittal to aadhaar kii pairvi karte hue spasht kehete hai, ''aadhaar laabhakaari yojana he
 Every government has the right to identify its citizens for the benefit of the scheme
 yah kaam 1947 main hi kar lenaa chahie tha
 But we are doing it now
 '' unki daleelon se saaf he ki sarkaar aadhaar par peeche nahin hategi
 But its difficulty is political because the Modi government does not want to show that the BJP is going ahead on the basis of the base project on which the question was raised while in opposition
 samaajawaadee party ke ek aise bhi vidhayak hai, jo khud ko hoicourt or hoicourt ke adeshon ke upar samajhate hai
 The case is in Lucknow, where the Hon'ble MLA stopped the Municipal Corporation squad, which went to remove illegal track shops after the High Court order
 emele ne kaha ki patari dukandaaron ko hataane se pehle kisi duusari jagah par basaaya jaae
 But on Saturday, when the municipal corporation went to break illegal construction as per the court order, the MLA, who became the Messiah of the people, did not reach the spot
 samaajawaadee party ke lakhanu madhya kshetra ke maujuuda vidhayak hai ravidaas mehrotra
 The MLA does not run in front of the influence of the Municipal Corporation, nor does the police
 yahaan tak ki ye nyaayalay ke aadesh ko bhi taak par rakhte hai
 The case of Aminabad, the famous market of Lucknow
 aminabad main trephic jam kii samasya or avaidh taur par sadakon par lagaai gai dukaanon ko lekar elahabaad kii lakhanu khandpeeth main ek yachika daayar kii gai thi
 Hearing the petition, the court ordered the district administration to remove the track shopkeepers and illegal constructions by 27 October and present the report to the court on 28th
 hoicourt ke aadesh kaa paalan karaane ke liye lakhanu nagar nigam kaa dasta jab police kii maujuudagi main 22 taarikh ko aminabad ke bazaar pahunchaa, to vahaan pehle to daste ko patari dukandaaron kaa virodh jhelana padaa
 Police handled the situation and the work of removing the encroachment began
 lekin itane main hi sattapaksh ke vidhayak ravidaas mehrotra vahaan pahunch gaye or unhone abhiyaan ko sthagit karne kaa elaan kar diya
 Since the mlas were from the ruling party, the municipal squad that arrived on the spot had to return backwards
 vidhayak ji is baat par ad gaye ki patari dukandaaron ko yahaan se hataane se pehle kahin or inaki vyavastha kii jaae
 Ravidas Mehrotra said that there are one and a half lakh footpath shopkeepers in Lucknow city
 agar bina kisi vyavastha ke inako ujaadne kii karrwai hogi, to inaki samasya kaise hal hogi? unhone daleel di ki aise dukandaaron ke saamne samasya roji-roti kii he
 Those who are shopkeepers on the sidewalk, do this to feed their stomach in compulsion
 ye garib, kamjor va asahaay varg ke log hai
 He said that our demand is that the public should not face any problem, so they should have an alternative system before they are destroyed
 is maamle main agar kisi kii gardan fansi thi, to wo thi nagar nigam or jila prashasan kii
 On one hand the Municipal Corporation had to follow the order of the High Court, on the other hand they could not offend the MLA
 lihaaja nagar nigam ne ek bich kaa rasta nikaala, jiske tahat aminabad kii bazaar main sadak ke kinare ek pili pattee khinch di gayi
 Track shopkeepers were ordered to set up shop inside that yellow strip
 avaidh nirmaan ko todane kii taarikh mukarrar kii gai 26 oktober
 When the municipal team reached Aminabad market to break the illegal construction on this date, people hoped that their sympathizer MLA Ravidas Mahrotra would come back to save the shops, but this did not happen
 vidhayak ji dur-dur tak kahin najar nahin aae or daste ne logon ke virodh ke baavjood avaidh nirmaan ko tod diya
 In fact, the case of the mla's arrogance started to jump, when he realized that his bet could also be heavy on him
 lihaaja vidhayak ji baikfoot par aa gaye

 " While dedicating the birth anniversary of the country's first home minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel as National Unity Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that a nation that does not respect its history cannot create it
 unhone varsh 1984 main aaj hi ke din tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad hue sikh virdohi dangon kaa apratyaksh zikr bhi kiya
 Underlining his contribution to the ceremony organized in honor of Sardar Patel, popularly known as "iron Man", the government clarified that the initiative is not an attempt to undermine the contribution of any other leader
 modi ne kaha, hamen yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki jo raashtra apane itihaas kaa sammaan nahin karata he, vah iskaa srijan kabhi nahin kar saktaa
 
 itihaas, viraasat ko vichaardhaara ke sankeern daayre main vibhajit mat kijiye

 This incident is not only a wound on the hearts of people of a particular religion, but a dagger in the heart of the country's heritage and culture of thousands of years
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki aaj purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi kii punyatithi he
 Recalling Sardar Patel's contribution to the freedom movement, Modi said that Mahatma Gandhi had entrusted him with the responsibility of planning the historic Dandi March, which he successfully completed
 pradhanmantri ne kaha, jab ham ramakrishna paramhans ko dekhte hai tab aisa lagata he ki vah swami vivekanand ke bina purna nahin hai
 In the same way when we see Mahatma Gandhi, he still seems incomplete without Sardar Patel
 isse pehle pradhanmantri kaa swaagat karte hue shahari vikaas mantri em venkaiya naidu ne kaha, agar sardaar patel desh ke pehle pradhanmantri hote, tab itihaas kuch or hota
 Many people feel like this
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki samaaroh kaa uddeshy kisi duusare raajnneetik netaa ke yogadan ko kamatar karnaa nahin he
 The Sangh has always believed that successive governments valued the contribution of the Jawaharlal Nehru and Nehru Gandhi families more than others
 sardaar patel kii tulana chanakya se karte hue modi ne kaha, desh sardaar patel ko kabhi nahin bhul saktaa
 Centuries ago, Chanakya successfully experimented to establish a strong structure by uniting small princely states
 unhone kaha, aazaadee ke baad yahi kaam us vyakti sardaar vallabhbhai patel ne kiya, jinaki aaj ham jayanti manaa rahe hai
 The Prime Minister said, it is unfortunate that a man who devoted his entire life to the unity of India faced opposition and criticism in his political life, but he never deviated from his goal of keeping the country united
 
 ‘ran for unity’ main hissaa lene vaale logon ko sambodhit karte hue modi ne kaha, hamaari samskruti or viraasat vividhta main ekta kii he
 We should rise above the differences of caste, community, language
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki sardaar patel ne apane kaushal, duuradrushti or deshbhakti se desh ko ek sutara main piroyaa
 Recalling Patel's contribution in keeping the country united after partition, Modi said, Sardar Patel demolished the British plan to divide India into many smaller areas
 unhone akele sabhi 550 kshetron kaa desh main vilay kiya
 Modi also praised Sardar Patel's vision and diplomatic ability to unite farmers in the freedom struggle against British rule
 unhone kaha, swatantraaa andolan main kisaanon ko ek takat ke rup main ekajute karne ke unke kaary ne angrejon ke bharat ko chote hisson main baantne ke sapane ko dhwast kar diya
 Calling people to rise above casteism, communalism and linguistic barriers , the Prime Minister said, "sardar Patel gave us an India, we have to make it a great India
" ‘ran for unity’ ko hari jhandi dikhne ke baad modi ne kuch dur tej chalakar daud kaa netritv bhi kiya
 Players like Sushil Kumar, Vijender Singh, Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir also participated in this race
 kendriya mantri sushamaa swaraj, venkaiya naidu, arun jetali evam anya ke saath pradhanmantri ne daud main hissaa lene waalon ko ekta kii shapath dilaai

 isse alaava do oktober ko jammu evam kashmir ke srinagar main hawaondde ke nazadik gogo humhamaa ilaake ke BSF camp par aatankiyon ne hamalaa kiya tha
 In this attack on the 182nd battalion of BSF, the army killed three terrorists
 is hamale main ek ASI shahid ho gaya tha, jabaki teen jawan ghayal ho gaye the

 iske tahat aatankiyon kii ek list taiyaar kii gai he, jiske aadhaar par alag-alag ilaakon main aatankiyon ke khilaaf search oparation chalaaya ja rahaa he or karrwai kii ja rahi he
 So far, many terrorists have been piled into the valley under this operation
 narendra modi 26 may ko pradhanmantri pad kii shapath lenge, lekin unhone kaam pehle hi shuru kar diya he
 This is probably the first time that a leader has started work even before he is sworn in as Prime Minister and an invitation from the President to form the government
 modi cabinet sachiv or grih sachiv se mil chuke hai
 According to the news, he had asked both these top officers to do many important work
 isi tarah sarkaar ke gathan ko lekar bhi unhone party ke kai varisht netaaon se mulaakaat kii he
 It is believed that the Modi government will be the tightest government in the history of the country
 ek aisi sarkaar, jise na to gathbandhan kii majaburiyon ke naam par manamafik mantralay lene ke sahyogi dalon ke dabaav ke aage jhukne kii majaburi he or na party ke andruni samikarnon main santulan bithaane ke liye bujurg netaaon ko edjust karne kaa dabaav jhelana he
 Preparations are on to open the doors of Rajbhavans to leaders who have crossed 75 spring
 khud modi 63 saal ke hai or unki sarkaar main ek-do apwaadon ko chhod umr main unase bada koi netaa shaayad hi mantri banaaya jaae
 In order to cut government expenditure and increase efficiency and efficiency in work, ministries are doing the greatest job of cutting and merging them
 sutron ke mutabik modi sarkaar ke sambhavit swaroop ko lekar kai maheenon se taiyaariyaan chal rahi hai
 Models of governments of many developed countries have been studied and a rough report has been prepared
 isi report ke aadhaar par charchaa chal rahi he ki kai gairzaruri mantralayon ko khatm kiya jayega
 Many ministries will be merged and many ministries will be converted into corporations
 misaal ke taur par grih mantralay se aantarik suraksha ko alag karne kaa prastaav he
 Under this proposal, a Minister of State will be given the charge of internal security and will be directly subordinated to the Prime Minister's Office
 modi sidhe-sidhe ibi or enie jaisi agenciyon ke rozmarra ke kaamkaaj par nazar rakh sakenge
 Similarly, it is proposed to create a new infrastructure ministry, in which several other ministries like surface transport and shipping can be combined
 isamen rail mantralay ko bhi milakar yatayaat mantralay banane kaa bhi prastaav tha, lekin rail mantralay ke baari aakaar ko dekhte hue philhal ise alag hi rakhane kaa vichaar he
 Separate ministries like petroleum and natural gas, energy, coal and non-conventional energy sources can be combined to form the Ministry of Power, while the rural ministries and panchayati raj ministries can also be merged
 isi tarah udyog, vaanijya, kapadaa va sookshm, laghu va manjhale udhyam mantralayon ko milakar ek baari-bharkam mantralay banane kaa prastaav he
 There are also plans to merge the ministries of agriculture, food, food processing, civil consumers and supplies
 ek prastaav yah bhi he ki doorsanchaar, soochna praudyogiki or soochna evam prasaaran mantralayon ko milakar ek nayaa mantralay banaaya jaae
 The thinking behind this is that when the area is the same, why should it be divided into different departments
 kai gairzaruri mantralayon ko khatm karne kaa bhi prastaav he
 The need for ministries like Overseas Indian is not being felt
 ek prastaav yah bhi he ki kai mantralayon ko nigamon main tabdeel kar diya jaae or unki zimmedaari kisi technocrat ko de di jaae
 In this way, the hassle of getting elected from Rajya Sabha or Lok Sabha within six months will be avoided
 alpsankhyak maamalon ke mantralay ko bhi aage jaakar nigam main badla ja saktaa he, jabaki nadiyon ko jodne yaa unhen saaf karne ke liye ek alag mantralay yaa nigam banane kaa bhi prastaav he
 In fact, the exercise of dividing ministries into separate portfolios began with coalition politics and a period of unstable governments formed in the '90s as a strategy to appease senior leaders
 kisi ko andaaza nahin rahaa hoga ki varsh 84 ke baad ek aisi sthir sarkaar banane ja rahi he, jo na sirf ek hi party kii he, balki use sahyogi dalon ke blackmel ke aage bhi nahin jhukna he
 There is no compulsion in front of Modi that important ministries like rail or defense be given to any allies to keep them happy, as happened during the Vajpayee government
 vaise bhi kaha jaataa he ki gathbandhan raajnneeti kaa sabase bada shikaar koi mantralay agar hua he, to vah rail mantralay hi he
 Overall, this entire exercise is being done in the form of 'bhooto na Bhavishti'
 'modi meens bijnes' ke mantra ke saath aane vaale paanch saal main kaam kaa khaakaa taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 The foundation of such a government is being laid which will take India on the path of making India an economic superpower in the 21st century at a fast and fast pace
 isiilie kaha ja rahaa he ki 26 taarikh ko mantrimandal main jagah na milane se bijepi or sahyogi dalon ke kai netaaon ke chehre agar latake nazar aaen, to hairaani nahin hogi
 The government said on Thursday that about 80 people die due to air pollution in Delhi every day
 haal hi jari kiye gaye ek antarrashtriya adhyayan main yah jaankaree di gai he
 In a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said that polluted air is one of the elements responsible for morbidity and premature death
 mantri ne kaha ki jari kiye gaye ek antarrashtriya adhyayan main daawa kiya gaya he kipradooshit vayuke kaaran dilli main pratidin lagbhag 80 logon kii maut hoti he
 The number of premature deaths given in the study is based on rational estimates and related data
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne is sambandh main dilli main do adhyayanon ko pryojit kiya tha, jinhen varsh 2003-2005 ke dauraan kiya gaya
 Studies indicate that damage to chromosomes and DNA is related to contamination, which increases the risk of various diseases

 america ke raashtrapati donald trump (donald Trump) ne kaha he ki bharat dwaara badi sankhya america utpaadon par 100 pratishat se adhik kaa shulk liya ja rahaa he
 Donald Trump asked his administration to look into such foolish business
 isse ek din pehle trump ne bharat kii aalochana karte hue use duniya kaa sabase adhik kar vaala desh bataaya tha
 The US President (donald Trump) has repeatedly called India a tariff king, which levies a very high tax on American products
 trump (donald Trump) ne shanivaar ko las vegas main kaha ki ek aisa maamla he jahaan bharat hamase kaaphi ooncha shulk vasuul kar rahaa he
 Great country, great friend, Prime Minister (narendra) Modi is charging more than 100 percent fee from us for many things
 unhone daawa kiya ki vahiin america dwaara bharat ke aise utpaadon par kuch bhi shulk nahin liya ja rahaa
 Significantly, before this, despite the terrorist attack in the United States and Pulwama and then on the issue of air strikes on terrorist bases in Pakistan, India was seen standing with India, but now it has started the economic front
 But i was preparing to give a big blow
 iske sanket khud americrashtrapati donald trump(donald Trump) ne die hai
 He created a new upheaval in the global economic corridor by making statements in the trade that India was excluded from the Generalized System of Preference (GSP)
 trump ne is babat america kisansad yani 'congress'ko bi baqayda patr likhakar suchit kar diya tha
 If it really happens then in the US market 5
 6 billian dollar mulya ke bhartiya utpaadon ke liye duty free yani shulk-mukt entry kaa darwaja band ho jayega
 This would be a major economic setback
 trump ne somvaar ko kaha tha ki vah bharat ke liye shulk mukt treetment ko khatm karne kaa iraadaa rakhte hai
 It was being told that if the partnership ends under the GSP, it would be the biggest action against India since Donald Trump took office as US President in 2017
 darasal, america vyapaar ghate ko kam karne kii kasam khaane vaale donald trump (donald Trump) kaa maananaa tha ki bharat vyapaar ke maamle main america ko apekshit sahyog nahin kar rahaa
 The reason is that India is charging a hefty tax on American products
 trump kai baar or kai manch se yah baat kah chuke hai
 He believed that India is a country that imposes higher tariffs on American products
 iske jawaab main unhone bhi bharat ke utpaadon ke america bazaar menduty free pravesh rokane kii sochi he
 Trump had said that i am taking this step because despite deep engagement with the US, India has not assured the US that it will provide equal and fair access to the Indian market

 The Karnataka election was also conducted on social media, according to which the Congress was predicted to get 76 seats, BJP 75 and JDS 70 seats
 yani 224 siton vaali vidhansabha main kisi ko bahumat nahin milegaa
 This news also became very viral on social media in which it was said that this opinion poll was done by Today Chanakya
 lekin khabar ke juthi hone kii pole tab khul gai jab today chanakya ne twit karke saaf kar diya ki unhone aisa koi opinian pole karavaaya hi nahin he
 To the extent that a letter from the Intelligence Branch of the state government allegedly went viral in the social media in which the Chief Minister was advised not to contest from Chamundeshwari seat as it would be difficult to win this seat
 angreji main likhi is chitthee main chunaav ladane ke liye chaar duusari seat bhi sujhai gayi thim
 ADG Intelligence has been signed and stamped on this seat
 lekin bahut gaur se dekhne par pataa chalata he ki muhar main Fire & Emergency Services likhaa he, intelligence kii report main fire or immergency services likhaa hona betuki baat he
 To get to the bottom of the case, 'aaj Tak' went to the official website of the Karnataka Police and found out who is the ADG Intelligence who has been signed on this letter
 website ke mutabik is post par ashit em prasad tainaat hai
 But when 'aaj Tak' talked to him, Ashit m Prasad said that his promotion has already taken place last year and he has become DG
 ediji intelligence kii post par ab koi nahin he jabaki ye chitthee 5 april kii bataai ja rahi he
 Prasad said that this letter issued in his name is completely fake and this signature is also not his
 unhone kaha ki wo is bare main exiaar bhi darj kara rahe hai
 Arun Jaitley is not campaigning in Karnataka elections
 iske baavjood virodhiyon ne unhen bhi karnataka chunaav main ghaseet liya
 Some people on social media started saying that Jaitley termed the rape case in Kathua as a minor incident
 sachai ye he ki jetali ne kathua ko lekar koi bayaan nahin diya he
 The video which is being told of Kathua is actually the video of 21 August 2014, in which he said how an incident also brings disrepute to the country
 karj ke maare sirf aap hi nahin he
 The debt of the Indian corporate world has doubled
 4 saal main bhartiya udyog jagat ne desh ke videshi mudra bhandar se zyada karj liya he
 Interestingly, there has been a 107 percent increase in debt
 dumka kaa dangal ek baar phir dilachasp hone ja rahaa he
 Two strong tribal leaders of Jharkhand, Shibu Soren and Babulal Marandi, will be face to face once again after 15 years
 gauratlab he ki saal 2000 main jharkhand rajya kaa gathan hone ke baad babulal marandi soobe ke mukhyamantri bane or phir unhone dumka kii jameen ko alavida kah diya tha
 In Jharkhand, it is expected that there will be a contest on every seat of the Lok Sabha, but the election scenario of Babulal Marandi from Dumka, the sub-capital of Jharkhand, has changed a lot
 yahaan do chir pratidwandvi 15 saal ke baad ek baar phir aamane-saamne hai
 Dumka ST is a safe seat
 santhal adivasee bahul is seat main yun to shibu sorain or babulal marandi, donon bahari santhal adivasee hai, lekin donon kii jamini pakad khaasi majboot he
 In the last matches between these two veterans, Marandi has been defeated twice, while Shibu Soren has had to face mouth once
 vaise babulal marandi, shibu sorain kii patni rupi sorain ko haraakar hisaab baraabar kar chuke hai
 Shibu Soren is also very excited about Babulal's contesting
 unka kahana he ki netaa kii ladaai aakhirkaar netaa se he
 The Dumka seat has become a battle of the nose for both the satraps this time
 vaise 24 march ko bijepi ke pradhanmantri ummidavaar narendra modi dumka main raily yojit kar yahaan bhagava rang chadhaane kii puri koshish karne vaale he
 By the way, Modi wave will be effective in this tribal belt also, it is less likely
 aagaamee dilli vidhansabha chunaav main mukhyamantri shila dikshit apni seat bachaane main bhi naakaam ho sakati hai
 Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal can beat him by a huge margin on the New Delhi assembly seat
 angreji akhbaar 'iconomic times' ne ek opinian pole ke hawaale se likhaa he ki is baar nai dilli vidhansabha seat par sabase bada ulatpher ho saktaa he
 The newspaper conducted this survey on 2101 registered voters of the constituency
 iske mutabik 4 taarikh ko hone ja rahe matdaan main 40 fisadi log kejariwal ko vot dene ja rahe hai
 Kejriwal can emerge as the choice of both men and women
 survey kii maane to unhen purushon ke 41 fisadi or mahilaon ke 42 fisadi vot mil sakate hai
 According to the survey, three-time Chief Minister Sheila Dixit will get the least votes
 unhen sirf 20 fisadi voton se santosh karnaa hoga
 bjp's candidate Vijender Gupta will be second
 unhen 21 fisadi vot mil sakate hai
 Very few people have participated in this survey conducted from 22 to 24 November
 lekin phir bhi isane kahin na kahin shila dikshit ke lambey raajnneetik kariyar par gambhir sawaal khadey kar die hai
 If she loses the election to a newly-mouthed leader like Kejriwal, it will be a big setback not only for Delhi but also for the Congress party at the national level
 agle saal hone vaale loksabhaa chunaavon ke lihaaj se bhi yah congress kaaryakartaaon ke liye behad niraashaa kaa mauka hoga
 The newspaper conducted this survey through 'face to Face' interview
 vah bhi aise samay main jab aam aadmi party ek vivaadit sting oparation kii kaali chaaya se jujh rahi he
 According to the survey, Kejriwal, 45 years old, is getting support from all sections of the society
 khaas taur se yuvaaon main vah behad lokapriy najar aate hai
 According to the survey, 49 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 25 are going to vote for Kejriwal
 isi umr ke 19 fisadi congress or 20 fisadi bijepi ko vot denge
 21 percent of the people who took part in this survey were 18 to 25 years old
 umr ke sabhi virgon main aam aadmi party bijepi-congress se behatar sthiti main najar aa rahi he
 According to the newspaper, only 2 in their survey
 12 fisadi kaa 'margin of erar' he
 The newspaper has shown a 95 percent confidence level on the survey
 yah vidhansabha kshetra 1
 It is home to 2
3 million voters
 2008 main parisemen se pehle is kshetra ko gol market kaha jaataa tha
 This is her 'home ground' for Sheila's electoral journey
 vah yahaan se teen baar chunaav jeet chuki hai
 However, the margin of his victory has decreased in the last two elections

 Modi said that in Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam Singh Yadav's daughter-in-law Dimple Yadav and other family members lost the election which clearly indicates that people have broken the caste wall this time and voted in the name of development

 a post shared by Priyanka Chopra (@priyankachopra) on Aug 18, 2018 at 5:38 am PDT saatven vetan ayog (7th Pay Commission) kii report kii sifarish ke baad alouns ko lekar hue vivaad ke baad sarkaar dwaara gathit samiti karmchaariyon ke pratinidhiyon se baat kar rahi he
 Several times in the last one month, it has been reported that this committee has completed negotiations and submitted its report to the government
 lekin baad main phir yah baat saaf hui ki samiti abhi bhi karmchaaree pratinidhiyon se baat kar rahi he
 Sources say that even today a meeting of the committee is going to be held with the representatives of the employees
 is baithak main kya nirnay hoga, is bare main baithak ke baad pataa chalegaa
 The meeting time is scheduled for four o'clock in the evening
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki karmchaariyon ko echaare, tie-die ke saath-saath kai or alouns ke mudde par saatven vetan ayog kii siforeeshon par aapatti he
 It is noteworthy that the seventh pay commission has abolished many allowances that have been going on since the British rule
 saatven vetan ayog ne maujuud 196 alouns main adhiktar ko yaa to samaapt kar diya yaa phir use milakar keval 55 alouns rakhe hai
 To resolve the objections of the central employees on the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission, the government had constituted three committees which were authorized to interact with the employees' representatives on all issues
 in samitiyon main ek samiti vitt sachiv ashok lavasa ke netritv main banaai gai thi
 The same committee also had the issue of allowance
 pehle kaha ja rahaa tha ki farvari kii 22 taarikh ko is samiti kii antim baithak hui jisamen karmchaariyon se antim baar alouns ke mudde par charchaa kii gai thi
 Representatives of the NJCA, a joint organization of employees, joined to negotiate with the Allowance Committee

 It is believed that this will be payable like the Fifth Pay Commission
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki inako die se alag kar diya jayega or yah fiks slab rate par tay hoga
 It is also being said that the committee has accepted the demand of the employees to give the rate of HRA as per the report of the Sixth Pay Commission
 doosraa sabase ahm sawaal ab bhi bana hua he ki sarkaar ne echaare ko kab se dene kii baat ko sweekaar kiya he
 This question is still haunting the employees

 17 se yah lagu hogi
 As far as the employees are concerned, they have been demanding to implement it since January last year and some time ago there was a hint from the government that all the disputed allowances will be implemented from 1 April 2017
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki karmchaariyon kii maang he ki echaare ko puraane formule ke aadhaar par tay kiya jaae yaa phir isaki dar badhaai jaae
 Central employees say that currently HRA employees are getting less than earlier as per the fixed formula
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog (seventh Pay Commission) dwaara kendriya karmchaariyon ko die jane vaale kai bhatton ko lekar asamanjas kii sthiti he
 The Narendra Modi government had approved the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission in 2016 and implemented the 7th Pay Commission report from 1 January 2016
 lekin, bhatton ke saath kai muddon par asahmati hone kii vajah se in siforishein puri tarah se lagu nahin ho pain
 It is being said that the officials authorized to negotiate on behalf of the government have agreed to raise the HRA to 1 level, now the HRA can be up to 30%, 20% and 10%
 vahiin, vishwasaneey sutron ke hawaale se khabar mil rahi he ki bade shaharon main ise 30 pratishat kiya ja saktaa he, lekin yah abhi tay nahin he
 The employees' organization has said that if the government has not increased the HRA, how can it be reduced
 apane tark ke samarthan main karmchaariyan kii daleel he ki kya shaharon main makaan kaa kiraaya kam hua he
 Have houses become cheap? jab yah nahin hua he to sarkaar apane karmchaariyon ke saath anyaay kaise kar sakati he
 Explain that the Pay Commission in its report had initially fixed the HRA as 24%, 16% and 8% and stated that when the DA reaches 50 percent it will be 27%, 18% and 9%
 Will be respectively
 itnaa hi nahin vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne yah bhi kaha tha ki jab die 100% ho jayega tab yah dar 30%, 20% or 10% kramash : eks, vaai or jed shaharon ke liye ho jaaegi
 It is noteworthy that in the memorandum related to their demand before the pay commission constituted by the joint organization of employees, NJCA asked for this rate to be 60%, 40% and 20% respectively
 sanghathan kaa aarope he ki ayog ne karmchaariyon kii maang ko puri tarah se thukraa diya tha
 He says that the Pay Commission has reduced this rate from the Sixth Pay Commission
 inkaa kahana he ki kyonki ise die ke saath joda gaya he to yah tabhi badhegaa jab die kii dar tay pratishat tak bad jaaegi
 The comments jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki saatvaan vetan ayog se pehle kendriya karmchaaree 196 kism ke alounces ke hakdaar the
 But the Seventh Pay Commission abolished or merged many allowances, leaving only 55 allowances left
 tamaam karmchaariyon ko kai alouns samaapt hone kaa malaal he
 Because many allowances have not been implemented yet and the employees have not received their direct benefits, the employees feel that the Pay Commission report is not yet implemented
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog kii report se karmchaariyon kii kai shikaayatein rahi hai or aise main centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne apane karmchaariyon kii shikayaton ko dur karne ke liye sambandhit mantralay or vittamantralay ke adheen samitiyon kaa gathan kiya he
 These committees are talking to the staff leaders and these committees had to give their decision to the government in four months but till now more than seven months have passed and so far no committee has submitted its report
 sutron kaa kahana he ki aaj bhi samiti kii ek baithak karmchaariyon ke pratinidhiyon se hone ja rahi he
 What will be decided in this meeting will be known after the meeting
 shaam chaar baje baithak kaa samay nirdhaarit he
 For information, please tell that the employees have objected to the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission on the issue of HRA, TA-DA as well as many more allowances
 ullekhneey he ki angrejon ke shashan kaal se chale aa rahe kai bhatton ko saatven vetan ayog ne samaapt kar diya he
 The Seventh Pay Commission has either abolished most of the 196 allowances present or has kept only 55 allowances
 saatven vetan ayog (seventh Pay Commission) kii siforeeshon par kendriya karmchaariyon kii aapattiyon ke niraakaran ke liye sarkaar ne sabhi muddon par baatcheet ke liye teen samitiyon ko gathan kiya tha jinako karmchaariyon ke pratinidhiyon se baatcheet ke liye adhikrut kiya gaya tha
 a committee was formed under the leadership of Finance Secretary Ashok Lavasa
 isi samiti ke paas alouns kaa mudda bhi tha
 It was earlier being said that the last meeting of this committee was held on 22nd of February in which the issue of allowance was last discussed with the employees
 alouns samiti se baatcheet karne ke liye karmchaariyon ke sanyukt sanghathan enzesie ke pratinidhi shaamil hue the
 (seventh Pay Commission: Union Minister in Parliament said important reason for delay in committee report) mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar ne transport alouns (yatra bhatta) ko do bhaagon main baanta he
 One is the CCA and the other is the TA given as undone
 yah paanchaven vetan ayog kii bhaanti dey hoga, aisa mana ja rahaa he
 It is also being said that they will be separated from DA and this fix will be fixed at slab rate
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki samiti ne karmchaariyon kii maang ko maanate hue echaare kii dar ko chathe vetan ayog kii report ke hisaab se dene kii baat ko sweekaar kar liya he
 The second most important question still remains as to how long the government has agreed to give the HRA
 yah prashn abhi bhi karmchaariyon ko sata rahaa he
 Does this rate 1
 1
 16 or 1 is applied
 4
 With effect from 17, it will be applicable
 jahaan tak karmchaariyon kaa sawaal he vah ise pichley saal janvari se lagu karwaane kii maang karte rahe hai or sarkaar kii ore se kuch samay pehle aisa ishaara mila tha ki sabhi vivaadit alouns ko 1 april 2017 se lagu kiya jayega
 For information, let us tell that the demand of employees is that HRA should be decided on the basis of the old formula or its rate should be increased
 kendriya karmchaariyon kaa kahana he ki vartmaan main tay formula ke hisaab se echaare karmchaariyon ko pehle kii tulana main kam milane laga he
 Let me tell you that there is confusion about many allowances given to the Central Employees by the Seventh Pay Commission
 narendra modi sarkaar ne 2016 main saatven vetan ayog (7th Pay Commission) kii siforeeshon ko manjuuri di thi or 1 janvari 2016 se 7wein vetan ayog kii report ko lagu kiya tha
 However, due to disagreement on several issues with allowances, these recommendations were not fully implemented
 kaha ja rahaa he ki sarkaar kii ore se baatcheet ke liye adhikrut adhikari echaare ko 1 str upar karne ko taiyaar hue hai ab echaare 30%, 20% or 10% tak ho saktaa he
 At the same time, reports are being received from reliable sources that 30 percent can be done in big cities, but it is not decided yet
 karmchaaree sanghathan kaa kahana rahaa he ki agar sarkaar ne echaare badhaayaa nahin he to gata kaise sakati hai
 In support of their argument, the workers argue that the rent of the house has come down in the cities
 kya makaan saste ho gaye hai
 When this has not happened how can the government do injustice to its employees
 bataa den ki vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne apni report main echaare ko aarambh main 24%, 16% or 8% tay kiya tha or kaha gaya tha ki jab die 50 pratishat tak pahunch jayega to yah 27%, 18% or 9% kramash: ho jayega
 Not only this, the Pay Commission had also said that when DA becomes 100%, then the rate will be 30%, 20% and 10% for X, y and z cities respectively
 ullekhneey he ki karmchaariyon ke sanyukt sanghathan enzesie ne gathit vetan ayog ke samaksh apni maang se sambandhit gyaapan main is dar ko kramash: 60%, 40% or 20% karne ke liye kaha tha
 The organization alleges that the commission completely rejected the employees' demand
 unka kahana he ki vetan ayog ne is rate ko chathe vetan ayog se bhi kam kar diya he
 They say that because it is combined with DA, it will increase only when the DA rate increases by a fixed percentage
 tippaniyan For information, let us know that before the Seventh Pay Commission, central employees were entitled to 196 types of allowances
 lekin saatven vetan ayog ne kai alounces ko samaapt kar diya yaa phir unhen mila diya jiske baad keval 55 alouns baaki rah gaye
 Many employees are sorry for ending many allowances
 kyonki kai alouns abhi tak lagu nahin hue or karmchaariyon ko uskaa sidhaa laabh nahin mila he to karmchaariyon ko lag rahaa he ki vetan ayog kii report abhi lagu nahin hui
 Explain that there have been many complaints of employees from the report of the Seventh Pay Commission and in such a situation the Narendra Modi government of the Center has set up committees under the concerned Ministry and Ministry of Finance to address the grievances of its employees
 ye samitiyaan karmchaaree netaaon se baat kar rahi hai or is samitiyon ko apana faisla chaar maheene main sarkaar ko dena tha lekin abhi tak saat maheene se zyada samay biit chukaa he or abhi tak kisi bhi samiti ne apni report nahin saunpi he
 To resolve the objections of the central employees on the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission, the government had constituted three committees which were authorized to interact with the employees' representatives on all issues
 in samitiyon main ek samiti vitt sachiv ashok lavasa ke netritv main banaai gai thi

 kaha ja rahaa he ki sarkaar kii ore se baatcheet ke liye adhikrut adhikari echaare ko 1 str upar karne ko taiyaar hue hai ab echaare 30%, 20% or 10% tak ho saktaa he
 At the same time, reports are being received from reliable sources that 30 percent can be done in big cities, but it is not decided yet
 karmchaaree sanghathan kaa kahana rahaa he ki agar sarkaar ne echaare badhaayaa nahin he to gata kaise sakati hai
 In support of their argument, the workers argue that the rent of the house has come down in the cities
 kya makaan saste ho gaye hai
 When this has not happened how can the government do injustice to its employees
 bataa den ki vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne apni report main echaare ko aarambh main 24%, 16% or 8% tay kiya tha or kaha gaya tha ki jab die 50 pratishat tak pahunch jayega to yah 27%, 18% or 9% kramash: ho jayega
 Not only this, the Pay Commission had also said that when DA becomes 100%, then the rate will be 30%, 20% and 10% for X, y and z cities respectively
 ullekhneey he ki karmchaariyon ke sanyukt sanghathan enzesie ne gathit vetan ayog ke samaksh apni maang se sambandhit gyaapan main is dar ko kramash: 60%, 40% or 20% karne ke liye kaha tha
 The organization alleges that the commission completely rejected the employees' demand
 unka kahana he ki vetan ayog ne is rate ko chathe vetan ayog se bhi kam kar diya he
 They say that because it is combined with DA, it will increase only when the DA rate increases by a fixed percentage
 tippaniyan For information, let us know that before the Seventh Pay Commission, central employees were entitled to 196 types of allowances
 lekin saatven vetan ayog ne kai alounces ko samaapt kar diya yaa phir unhen mila diya jiske baad keval 55 alouns baaki rah gaye
 Many employees are sorry for ending many allowances
 kyonki kai alouns abhi tak lagu nahin hue or karmchaariyon ko uskaa sidhaa laabh nahin mila he to karmchaariyon ko lag rahaa he ki vetan ayog kii report abhi lagu nahin hui
 Explain that there have been many complaints of employees from the report of the Seventh Pay Commission and in such a situation the Narendra Modi government of the Center has set up committees under the concerned Ministry and Ministry of Finance to address the grievances of its employees
 ye samitiyaan karmchaaree netaaon se baat kar rahi hai or is samitiyon ko apana faisla chaar maheene main sarkaar ko dena tha lekin abhi tak saat maheene se zyada samay biit chukaa he or abhi tak kisi bhi samiti ne apni report nahin saunpi he
 It is also being said that the committee has accepted the demand of the employees to give the rate of HRA as per the report of the Sixth Pay Commission
 doosraa sabase ahm sawaal ab bhi bana hua he ki sarkaar ne echaare ko kab se dene kii baat ko sweekaar kiya he
 This question is still haunting the employees
 kya yah dar 1
 1
 16 se lagu kii gai he yaa phir 1
 4
 17 se yah lagu hogi
 As far as the employees are concerned, they have been demanding to implement it since January last year and some time ago there was a hint from the government that all the disputed allowances will be implemented from 1 April 2017
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki karmchaariyon kii maang he ki echaare ko puraane formule ke aadhaar par tay kiya jaae yaa phir isaki dar badhaai jaae
 Central employees say that currently HRA employees are getting less than earlier as per the fixed formula
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog (seventh Pay Commission) dwaara kendriya karmchaariyon ko die jane vaale kai bhatton ko lekar asamanjas kii sthiti he
 The Narendra Modi government approved the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission in 2016 and implemented the 7th Pay Commission report from 1 January 2016
 lekin, bhatton ke saath kai muddon par asahmati hone kii vajah se in siforishein puri tarah se lagu nahin ho pain
 It is being said that the officials authorized to negotiate on behalf of the government have agreed to raise the HRA to 1 level, now the HRA can be up to 30%, 20% and 10%
 vahiin, vishwasaneey sutron ke hawaale se khabar mil rahi he ki bade shaharon main ise 30 pratishat kiya ja saktaa he, lekin yah abhi tay nahin he
 The employees' organization has said that if the government has not increased the HRA, how can it be reduced
 apane tark ke samarthan main karmchaariyan kii daleel he ki kya shaharon main makaan kaa kiraaya kam hua he
 Have houses become cheap? jab yah nahin hua he to sarkaar apane karmchaariyon ke saath anyaay kaise kar sakati he
 Explain that the Pay Commission in its report had initially fixed the HRA as 24%, 16% and 8% and stated that when the DA reaches 50 percent it will be 27%, 18% and 9%
 Will be respectively
 itnaa hi nahin vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne yah bhi kaha tha ki jab die 100% ho jayega tab yah dar 30%, 20% or 10% kramash : eks, vaai or jed shaharon ke liye ho jaaegi
 It is noteworthy that in the memorandum related to their demand before the pay commission constituted by the joint organization of employees, NJCA asked for this rate to be 60%, 40% and 20% respectively
 sanghathan kaa aarope he ki ayog ne karmchaariyon kii maang ko puri tarah se thukraa diya tha
 He says that the Pay Commission has reduced this rate from the Sixth Pay Commission
 inkaa kahana he ki kyonki ise die ke saath joda gaya he to yah tabhi badhegaa jab die kii dar tay pratishat tak bad jaaegi
 The comments jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki saatvaan vetan ayog se pehle kendriya karmchaaree 196 kism ke alounces ke hakdaar the
 But the Seventh Pay Commission abolished or merged many allowances, leaving only 55 allowances left
 tamaam karmchaariyon ko kai alouns samaapt hone kaa malaal he
 Because many allowances have not been implemented yet and the employees have not received their direct benefits, the employees feel that the Pay Commission report is not yet implemented

 stress galat poshchar kii vajah se hota he
 Youth working at computer needs to learn to sit properly
 ek shaam shuukravaar ko mumbai kii ek finance company main kaam karne vaala 30 saal kaa research analist ankit meri clinics main aayaa
 He spoke of a sharp pain in the neck
 uski mansapeshiyaan itani akadi hui thim ki vah sir bhi sidhe nahin uthaa paa rahaa tha
 When asked, he told that he had to sit in the chair all day and watch several monitors simultaneously
 alag-alag oonchai par rakhe un monitor se use aankade lene hote hai or apane computer main daalana hota he
 Since one has to constantly look up, there is pain in the neck and back
 tatkaal raahat ke liye vah koi penkiller le letaa, lekin us din kya hua ki puure hafte lagaataar kaam karne kii vajah se achaanak gardan akad gai
 Like Ankit, there are many people who stick to their desktops, laptops, smartphones and tabs, which affects their bodies
 mansapeshiyaan akad jaati hai, peeth main dard hota he or gardan akad jaati he, kalaayiyon main dard hota he
 All this normally happens with those who sit in a chair for a long time
 aise log hafte ke ant main khub varjish karte hai taaki apni jeevanstyli ko kuch raahat de saken
 This causes injury to the muscles of his shoulders and knees
 ankit ko dekhne ke baad maine paaya ki uski gardan kii mansapeshiyaan sankuchit ho gai thim jisase vah akad gai thim
 Thankfully, despite this, he did not complain of spondylitis or disc
 ankit jaise logon ke saath darasal yah hota he ki kaam ke dauraan unke sharir kaa sahaj mudaav prabhavit hota rahata he
 In the beginning, they sit on the chair properly but as the muscles get tired they come to the posture to lie on the chair
 kulha tedha hone ke kaaran qamar ke paas kii ridh kaa mudaav khinch jaataa he
 In this case, if someone bends his neck at an angle according to the TV or computer, the spine comes in a strange position
 yadi yah mudra lambey samay tak rahi to mansapeshiyaan asantulit ho jaati hai
 Spinal discs are endangered and there is an increased risk of spondylitis
 log dard se isliye chatpataate hai kyonki ve apane sharir kaa istemaal karnaa bhul chuke hote hai
 Seating training in the right posture requires awareness
 yadi aap apane swasthya ke prati jaagruk hai to aisi samasya kaa turant samaadhaan kar sakate hai
 Prevent havoc on the waist
 Some very simple ways to keep the posture fine while sitting
 sunishchit karen ki baithte vakt aapaki peeth kursi se peeche kii ore satee ho
 Make sure your chair is not too low, causing your knees to bend more
 aapaki jaanghen farsh ke samanaantar honi chahie
 Sit close to the keyboard
 keyboard tak pahunchane ke liye baahon ko failaana na pade
 When possible, pull the arms, legs, neck and back
 tivi yaa computer kii screen ko itnaa upar rakhen ki aapaki gadran ko baar-baar upar-neeche na karnaa pade
 If the table is large, make a tap to rest the wrist and arm
 bich-bich main uthte rahen
 Fix the height of the table so that your shoulders are relieved

 toilet ke liye gaddha khodakar akshay ne kiya film kaa pramotion a tiger love of Balasaheb Thorat, a minister in Maharashtra, may cost him dearly
 nagpur ke chidyaghar main ek baagh ke pijade main janaa or use pyaar se dularna mantri ji ke liye musiibat ban saktaa he
 Because by doing this the Minister has broken the law
 baagh ke pinjade main jhak safed kurta-pyjama pahane maharashtra sarkaar main mantri bala sahab thoraat nagpur ke chidyaghar main aae the khubasurat baagh ko dekhne
 i could not stop looking and entered her pizzeria
 mantri ji ke saath unka dal-bal bhi pahunch gaya pijade main
 The minister caressed the tiger, loved it
 lekin mantri bala sahab thoraat shaayad bhul gaye ki logon ko dikhaane ke liye jo wo kar rahe hai wo himmat se zyada majaak he pashu ke saath bhi or kanoon ke saath bhi
 The zoo administration also did not ignore the rules, Balasaheb Thorat also forgot that tiger can flare, it can be dangerous
 khayr, mantri ji is baat kii phikr bhala kyon karte
 But at least the zoo administration should have noticed this

 is saal rajya sarkaar ke schuli shiksha vibhaag ne har anganbari ko 'chachaa nehru' kaa janmdin manaane ke liye mahaj 100 rupee die jane ko manzuri di
 In the order of the school education department, the BJP leader criticized the guidelines that how to celebrate Children's Day? But for the expenditure on this, every Anganwadi gave a fund of 100 rupees only
 bijepi netaa rahul kothaari ne rajya sarkaar ke is kadam par pratikriya main kaha, 'har anganwari main ausat taur par ek darjan se zyada kuposhit bachche hote hai
 The state government can withdraw 100 rupees only for them and also on the birthday of the person whom they describe as the creator of modern India and children who were close to their heart
 'congress bachaav main bolicongress ne sarkaar ke kadam kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki rajya kii pichhali sarkaar aise aayojanon ke liye sirf 50 rupee hi manzur karti thi
 An Anganwadi coordinator in Bhopal told India Today, 'so how could the children of Anganwadi celebrate Uncle Nehru's birthday with a budget of 100 rupees? We could have done what was possible to us on this occasion, but not from the 100 rupees that were given to us
 sarkaar ko thodaa samvedansheel hona chahie tha or kam se kam 500 rupee har anganwari ko dene chahie the

 'nehru or shiksha' sheershak se barkatullah uniwarsity main seminar kaa aayojan kiya gaya

 a post shared by KK (@therealkarismakapoor) on Dec 20, 2017 at 2:58am PSTA little forest for Taimur a little boy can never have enough of birds, bees and butterflies and so we have put together a small forest as a birthday gift for the little big boy, Taimur, in Sonave
 It's a special forest, one that thrives on intercropping and i hope that as he grows he too will thrive in and celebrate a diverse society
 a society where people live together through and due to their distinctions
 The forest has about 100 trees on a 1000 sq ft plot
 The trees are as young as Taimur, even younger actually, and each one of them is a local, native, climate resilient specie
 It will be a forest of the super foods of the future
 There are 3 jamuns, 1 jackfruit, 1 amla, 40 Bananas, 14 Moringas, 1 Kokum, 1 Papaya, 5 Seetaphal, 2 Ramphals, 2 Nimbu trees
 Besides these it grows 3 different types of native pulses and many Mirchi, Ginger, Turmeric and kari patta plants
 Not to mention the green leafy veggies and the genda phools that grow in between
 The forest is inspired by Padma Shri Subhash Palekar's zero budget natural farming where one tree grows symbiotically off another and thus is thrifty on one's pocket
 The forest will become a home for pollinating agents like the butterflies, bees, birds and earthworms
 It will help nurture the soil, fix back the nitrogen and minerals in the soil that it grows on, preserve the water table and look elegant and beautiful while doing it all
 Here’s to living sustainably! Happy Birthday

 For a navy that is full of old structures and most of its fleet is more than two decades old, it is easy to blame the recent events for obsolete goods and rusting machines
 lekin pichley teen saal main pani kii is takat ko jin 24 haadason se jujhna padaa, un sabakaa adhyayan yah kahata he ki samasya kii jaden kahin gahari hai
 From the leadership crisis to the ever-increasing monitoring role, the Navy is currently going through its biggest peacetime crisis
 yah baat ajeebogareeb lag sakati he lekin bhartiya nausena ko hakeekat main naukaaon or jangi jahaajon kaa unki tay jindagi se kahin zyada samay tak rakh-rakhaav, sanchaalan or dohan karne kii kshamta rakhane kaa gaurav hasil he
 Sitting in the gallery room of the huge naval building, where Anjali Ila Menon's fifteen-year-old mural has recently been restored, Admiral R
 popularly known as Robin
 ke
 Dhowan gives the example of INS Virat
 lambey samay tak yah bharat kaa akelaa jangi jahaaj tha
 The ship is still floating on water 55 years after its first induction into military service
 dhovan ne india today se kaha, ‘‘kisi bhi badi nausena kii hi tarah hamaare paas bhi puraane jangi jahaajon kii khep he lekin ham unhen kai saal se chalaate aa rahe hai or kaayade se chalaa rahe hai
 "of course, the smallest of the three military forces — the navy, is surrounded by old platforms
" pandubbiyon se lekar yudhpot or aksar nazarandaaj kar die jane vaali sahaayak naukaaon tak, nausena khud yah hisaab bataati he ki kisi bhi samay uske bede kaa lagbhag aadha hissaa 20 saal se bhi zyada umr kaa rahata he
 But is this the only reason for many accidents that have troubled this army of water in recent years? No, and there is almost no consensus among stakeholders within and outside the Navy on this
 aaie kuch tathyon par nigaah daalen
 In the last three years, the Navy has suffered 24 major accidents
 inamen se record 14 ghatnaayen, nausena pramukh ke rup main admiral di
 K
 joshi ke 18 maheene ke kaarykaal main huin
 But analyzing the nature of these events (see graphic), the fact is that most of them had a small, if any small, or negligent human error rather than a normal machine or material malfunction
 haalanki aath durghatnaon main jaanch kaa kaam abhi tak puraa nahin hua he, lekin nausena ne in haadason ke liye jimmedaar laaparvaahiyon ke liye 49 afasaron samet 67 karmchaariyon ke khilaaf anushaasanamak karrwai shuru kii he
 These accidents include everything from sinking a ship to the bottom of the sea to submarine fire
 nausena pramukh ne bhi is baat kaa pukhta sanket diya he ki yah nausena kii sabase badi shaantikalin durghatana he
 The explosion in the INS Sindhurakshak submarine, which killed 18 people, was the result of a series of incidents, including the lack of operational procedures as well as safety measures to supervise explosives in the submarine
 haalanki system main baithe log is baat ko yah thappa dene main hichakate hai lekin hakeekat yahi he ki nausena netritv ke sankat se jujh rahi he
 There are many examples of omissions in nighabani or command
 janvari main vishakhapatnam bandargah main pravesh karte vakt apana propeller kshatigrast karne vaale agrim shrenee ke ubhaychar jangi jahaaj ienes airavat se lekar pichley saal disambar main ek hi hafte ke darmyaan do alag-alag haadason main bhidnt kaa shikaar hue talwaar or tarkash tak, nausena is nishkarsh par pahunchi he ki zyaadaatar ghatnaon main koi gambhir maanviya khami shaamil he
 Many lacked basic navigational skills or awareness of the area
 lihaaja inamen yaa to aadha-adhuraa prashikshan najar aata he yaa phir aisi kariyar growth jise samuchit tareeke se disha nahin mili
 Informed people say that flaws start before a ship gets into the water
 majhele rank ke ek adhikari ne mana, ‘‘dockyard ke adhikari kisi jahaaj ko yah jaanate hue bhi pani main utarane yogya bataa dete hai ki usamen kai dikkatein hai
 Many initial necessary investigations are only on paper
 pani par chalane or ladgaye ke maanak to bhul hi jaaen, kai martabaa to jahaaj tairne ke maanakon par bhi khare nahin utarate
 "they further say that safety procedures are often ignored because if all the investigations are done firmly," it will be difficult for many ships to land on water
 ’’jaruri nahin ki purana jahaaj bekaar hi ho lekin koi kharaab rakh-rakhaav vaala jahaaj jarur jokhim bharaa ho saktaa he
 Another serving naval officer said, "the commander-in-chief wants to see most of his ships at sea
" captain jaanata he ki uskaa kariyar isi baat par nirbhar karata he ki uskaa jahaaj tairta rahe
 Many shortcuts are used to achieve this, which have fatal consequences
 ’’nausena bhi is samasya kii gambhirtha se puri tarah waakif he
 In fact, after a number of major accidents, the list of "reforms" that he has prepared, in this "basic importance" has been given priority over safety checks and procedures
 admiral dhovan kehete hai, ‘‘hamane saare kaaryon ke liye prakriyaayein or maanak tay kar rakhe hai
 We will have to review and make sure that these security aspects are not violated, security audits should be done on time and all procedures are strictly followed
 ’’haalanki ye mudde varshon se parat-dar-parat jamaa hote rahe hai, lekin inaki parinti durghatnaon or haadason ke rup main haal ke varshon main najar aane lagi jab nausena par kaam kaa boj ekaek bad gaya
 After the 2008 terrorist attacks on Mumbai, the role of the Navy increased significantly at sea compared to before
 machuaaron kii naavon se milane vaale tabadatod sandeshon ke aadhaar par samudr main baar-baar kerani padi rahi andhi daudon se lekar zyada pukhta khufia jaankariyon par sakriy karrwai tak, nausena kii tateey jimmedaariyaan kai guna bad gai hai
 Admiral Arun Prakash, former naval chief, says, "naval operational activity has been steadily increasing since 2008, adding to additional pressure on warships and naval personnel
" ’’nausena kaa kahana he ki pratishat ke sandarbh main pichley kuch varshon main uske jangi jahaajon or vimaanon par gasht tathaa mishan kaa boj kam-se-kam 75 fisadi bad gaya he
 This operational burden will continue to increase
 karmiyon ke morche par bhi kai sari chunautiyaan hai
 Take, for example, the underlying dissatisfaction on an issue known as the "SONA" process
 anaupchaarik rup se sambodhit sona main junior or majhole str ke ve adhikari shaamil hai jo sidhe cmanderon or varisht netaaon se jude hai or jinke bare main yah mana jaataa he ki unhen posting tathaa promoshan main variyata milti he
 Many officers within the system complain that advancing careers in the Navy now depends more on these relationships and less on professional grounds
 in pareshaaniyon main ujaale kii kiran yah he ki nausena ab in muddon ko sweekaar karne or inke samaadhaan kii disha main kaam karne main lagaataar khulaa rukh dikhaa rahi he
 Recently, making the list of the above 24 events public is different from the earlier ignored pattern in which the Navy refused to accept any problem
 sosayadi for policy studies ke nideshak si
 Says Uday Bhaskar, "the Navy will have to sit together at the level of flag officers
 duniya kii kai nausenaon ko isi tarah ke sankaton se jujhna padaa he or ek vastugat samiksha sabko aage lekar ja sakati he
 "the Navy is arguably at the cusp of change and in the coming years, while trade and economy will be decisive, it will become an important tool of India's global dominance
" aise main jitani teji se vah apane aapako durust karegi, utani hi jaldi vah is bhoomika ko akhriyaar kar paaegi

 Navjot Singh Sidhu, former cricketer and Congress leader in the 1988 non-willful murder case, is not taking the name of the problems
 supreme court main guuruuvaar ko road rej cese ko lekar hui sunwaayee main punjab sarkaar ke vakil ne kaha ki siddhu maamle main shaamil the, unhen sajaa milani chahie
 At the same time, the petitioner said in the Supreme Court that the three-year sentence given by the Punjab and Haryana High Court should also be upheld
 punjab sarkaar ke vakil ne do abhiyukton kii sajaa kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki punjab or haryana hoicourt ne siddhu ko doshi tehraaya he unhen sajaa milani chahie
 He said that the statement given by Sidhu in the court is false in which he defended himself
 sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne sawaal kiya ki aaropee number do rupinder sandhu par kaise aarope lagaae gaye, jabaki exiaar main uskaa naam tak shaamil nahin tha
 Also, the court asked why Sidhu's statement under CRPC S313 cannot be believed
 sunwaayee ke dauraan punjab sarkaar ke vakil ne kaha ki 1988 ke is road rej maamle main hoicourt ne navjot singh siddhu ko doshi tehraaya he, isliye unhen sajaa milani chahie
 However, the court said that the next hearing of the case would be held on Tuesday
 purv cricketer or saansad navjot singh siddhu kii yachika par supreme court main buudhvaar ko sunwaayee ke dauraan shikayatakarta ne kaha ki siddhu ke khilaaf laaparvaahee se hui maut kaa nahin balki hatya kaa maamla banataa he
 Because Sidhu knew what he was doing
 unhone jo kiya samajhaboojh kar kiya, isliye un par hatya kaa mukadmaa chalanaa chahie
 The complainant said that if it was a case of road rage, he would have hit and run away
 lekin yahaan par siddhu ne pehle unhen gaadi se nikaala or jor kaa mukka maaraa
 They could slap or hit the feet
 lekin yahaan unhone jaanboojhkar kar sir par mukka maaraa or car kii chaabi bhi nikaal lee
 The complainant also said that the court in one of its judgments had ordered the evidence to come on record after 35 years
 is maamle main bhi aisa kiya ja saktaa he kyonki shikayatakarta ko ek nijee channel par siddhu ke intervyuu kii sidi abhi mili he
 However, on Tuesday, Sidhu opposed the complainant's plea in which the complainant has filed a fresh petition in the 1988 Road Rage case alleging that in his interview on a private channel in 2010, Sidhu had admitted that He is guilty of this crime
 siddhu kii taraf se kaha gaya ki supreme court abhi apil par sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 Therefore it cannot be kept on record, in such a case, if they want to file a petition, then file it in the lower court or high court
 purv cricketer navjot singh siddhu ko gaiyr iradatan hatya ke maamle main punjab-haryana hai court ne siddhu ko doshi tehraate hue teen saal kii sajaa sunai thi
 Against whom he had filed a petition in the Supreme Court and the court had also stayed his conviction
 siddhu ko dena pad saktaa he istifapunjab sarkaar ke vakil dwaara siddhu par hoicourt ke faisle ko barkaraar rakhane kii maang ke baad akali dal ne sidhe taur par unase istipha maanga he
 The Akali Dal said that Navjot Singh Sidhu will have to resign even after the decision of the Supreme Court
 agali sunwaayee main agar supreme court punjab evam haryana hoicourt ke faisle ko barkaraar rakhata he or 3 saal kii sajaa jari rahati he to aisi surat main siddhu ko mantri pad se bhi haath dhonaa pad saktaa he
 On the other hand, the Akali Dal has directly demanded Sidhu to resign on the Model Ground with immediate effect, while the BJP has also started making statements against Sidhu, although the Supreme Court is yet to hear on the next date
 But his political opponents have started barricading
 kya he maamladansal, haryana or punjabahicourtne unhen 2006 main 1988 ke ek hatya ke maamle main sajaa sunai
 In 1988 he had a fight with a man named Gurunam Singh
 marpet ke baad is shaks kii maut ho gai thi
 He was sentenced to three years in prison by the High Court
 wo kai din jail main rahe the
 In 2007, the Supreme Court granted relief to Sidhu and stayed the High Court verdict
 raashtrapati kovind ne maharashtra main lagaaya raashtrapati shashanmodi cabinet ne kii thi raashtrapati shashan kii anushansamaharashtra main satta kaa sangharsh apane charam par he
 After the Bharatiya Janata Party refused to form the government, the Governor first invited the Shiv Sena and now the Nationalist Congress (NCP) to form the government
 lekin modi cabinet kii anushansa ke baad raashtrapati ramnath kovind ne rajya main raashtrapati shashan ko manjuuri de di
 In this way, the power struggle that has been going on for the last several days has become patented today
 abhi bhi jari he baatcheet kaa daurarajyapal ne bijepi or shivasena ke baad ensipi ko sarkaar banane ke liye aamantrit kiya tha
 Night 8 to present its claim to NCP
 30 tak vakt tha
 For this reason, according to the pre-decided schedule, senior Congress leaders Ahmed Patel, Mallikarjun Kharge and KC Venugopal had gone to Maharashtra to meet NCP chief Sharad Pawar with the message of Sonia Gandhi, the interim president of the party
 yah he sarkaar gathan kaa ensipi-congress kaa formulabcheet ke dauraan congress ne sarkaar gathan ke liye apni kuch sharten ensipi ke samaksh rakhi hai
 According to sources, the Congress is focused on the Common Minimum Program
 lekin ensipi chaahati he ki congress sarkaar kaa hissaa ho taaki rajya ko majboot or sthaayee sarkaar diya ja sake
 With this, the NCP wants the power of Maharashtra to be run by the Chief Minister of Shiv Sena for two and a half years and NCP for the remaining two and a half years
 iske saath hi ensipi congress ko paanch saal dipti siem kaa pad bhi dena chaahati he
 Government could not be formed even after 19 days, tell you that the counting of votes was done in Maharashtra on 24 October
 chunaavon main bijepi-shivasena kii mahayuti ko spasht bahumat mila tha
 Even after getting the majority, they got stuck together in the formation of the government and the paths of both parties diverged
 iske baad rajya main kisi bhi dal ke paas bahumat na hone kii vajah se matganana ke baad se ab tak 19 din biit chuke hai or rajya main sarkaar gathan nahin ho paaya he
 It was after the elections that the party won a total of 105 seats in the state after the party elections and emerged as the largest party
 56 siton par jeet ke saath shivasena rajya kii duusari sabase badi party thi
 That is, bjp-shiv Sena Mahayuti had a total of 161 seats, which was much higher than the majority figure
 iske baad 54 siton ke saath ensipi jabaki chauthe number congress thi jise 44 siton par jeet mili thi

 supreme court ne somvaar ko apane ek faisle main centre or rajya sarkaron ko nirdesh die hai ki is baat kaa dhyaan rakhaa jaae ki kisi bhi avaidh naagarik kaa aadhaar card na bane
 Along with this, the court has also given instructions that Aadhaar card is not mandatory for essential services like LPG connection, telephone etc
 court ne yah nirdesh ek janhit yachika kii sunwaayee ke dauraan diya
 Earlier it was necessary to have an Aadhaar card for many things and those who did not have an Aadhaar card were having problems

 Most of the confusion was on the issue of LPG, which has now gone away after the court's decision

 kitaab ko padhakar jo baat saamne aati he vah yah ki aise logon ke paas samaaj main apni pahchaan se zyada bada sankat apni jeevika ko lekar he
 The third clap is based on what the lives of the kinners are and how they live
 teesri tali main akelaapan he, jise sabhi charitron ke jivan main dekha ja saktaa he
 It is a bold novel of Hindi, which shows the segregation that exists in society about gender
 kitaab ke bare main kitaab ke flap par likhi pakanj pachori kii tippanee bahut sateek he
 He says, "it is a world of bisexual socials and barracks, cisterns, potters, lesbians and perverted-natures that exists in every city and lives at the fringe of society
" 'kahani kii shuruyaat gautam sahab ke charitra se hoti he, jinke ghar betaa hua lekin ve hijadon ke lakh teesri tali bajaane-gane ke baad bhi darwaja nahin kholte hai
 Because the characters of Gautam sahib, Anandi aunt have also expressed the pain of parents, whose right to be happy when they are children depends on the gender of the child
 baccha ubhalingi he to yah ek mahapaap he
 Whom Gautam saheb, Anandi aunt, spend many years of his life hiding from the world
 lekin samaaj unke dard ko samay ke saath nasoor bana detaa he, jiskaa ant aatmahatya jaise krity par hota he
 Although each character very well tells a new truth and pain, but by the end one character tells the story of being dead despite being alive, that is Vineet, not Vineeta
 haa, yahi he uske jivan kaa adhuraa sach jo use kaamyaab bhi banaata he
 But it gives him the emptiness of life
 kitaab kaa aakhri panna khatm hota he vijay kii kahani par jo ek patrkaar he
 He has the courage to fight the injustice and take every risk in front of the whole world
 magar ek sach he jo vah duniya se chhipaakar rakhata he or yahi vajah he ki vah samaaj main izzatdaar logon main gina jaataa he
 But in the end he tells the truth that he is not a complete man but a eunuch
 kitaab ke aakhri panne ke saath beshak kahani khatm ho jaati he, lekin aise kai sawaal samaaj par uthaati he
 Due to which life of a section has become hell
 is nowell main kai rochak baaten bhi saamne nikalakar aati he, jinase saamaanya varg puri tarah se bekhbar he
 For example, eunuchs who marry or say they consider their husband are called Giriya
 unke naam kaa karwachouth bhi rakhte hai
 Many times, eunuchs do not marry, but one day they become happy, and the other day they become widows
 yah pratha he jiske bare main kuvagam meley se shuruyaat hoti he 
 The fair is held at Villupuram in Tamil Nadu
 is meley main desh bhar se hajaaron hijde aate hai
 These people of the third cunt, who are away from the relationship, get a chance to become happy here for a day
 is tarah unki shaadi karne kii muraad puri hoti he
 This ritual does not end here as it is followed by the ritual of breaking the mangalsutra and all the eunuchs mourn the widowhood
 is rasm main sabhi bad-chadh kar hissaa lete hai
 If anyone dares to break this tradition, the consequences are very serious
 lekhak ne samaaj main tisare ling ke rup main pahchaan rakhane waalon ke jivan ko itane kareeb se chuaa he ki shaayad hi koi resha ho jo haath nahin lage
 The most important thing is that in this society, which we do not consider as a part of the society, they have their own problems
 jaise ki hijadon ke buudhe ho jane par gaddi ke uttaradhikari kii samasya, aadhunik samaaj kii rivaayaton ke chalate hijadon kaa sex racket main judana
 It is a courageous novel in Hindi, which introduces a world full of the urge to live in society, despite the loneliness of gender and the isolation of gender
 jivan main aise tamaam sach hote hai, jise ham maane yaa nahin maane lekin unka apana vajood he, kyonki un par samaaj kii muhar bhle hi nahin lagi ho lekin vakt ne bevakt muhar jarur lagaai he

 sarkaar ne kaha ki vah pichley chaar din se trinmul congress pramukh mamata banerjee se sampark karne kii koshish kar rahi he kyonki pradhanmantri manmohan singh epadiai or dijal kii keemton main hui badhotaree kii vajah bataanaa chaahate hai, lekin isamen safalataa nahin mili
 Finance Minister p Chidambaram said, 'we tried to talk to him four days ago
 pradhanmantri ne unase baat karne kii koshish kii
 We left a message for them so that they could talk
 unki taraf se koi sandesh nahin mila
 Chidambaram was replying to questions about the Trinamool Congress' decision to withdraw support from the government to protest FDI in retail and hike in diesel price
 congress kor group kii baithak ke baad unka yah bayaan aayaa he
 The issue of withdrawal of support from the UPA was discussed in this meeting
 is baithak main tay kiya gaya ki samprag sarkaar dijal kii keemton main vruddhi or khudara vyapaar main pratyaksh videshi nivesh sahit apane un faislon ke bare main trinmul congress ko spashtikaran degi, jiske chalate mamata banerjee kii is party ne sarkaar se samarthan waapas lene kaa faisla kiya he
 After the meeting of the top leaders of the party headed by Sonia Gandhi at the Prime Minister's residence, sources said that the government would brief the ministers of the Trinamool Congress about the circumstances under which these decisions were taken
 is baat kaa koi sanket nahin mila he ki sarkaar epadiai ke nirnay ko puri tarah waapas lene, dijal ke daamon main paanch rupe kii vruddhi main kami karne or ek saal main riyayati rasoi gas silendar kii sankhya chah se 12 kiye jane kii trinmul congress pramukh mamata banerjee kii maangon par kya rukh apnayegi
 The Trinamool has said that if the Center does not agree to its demands, then its six ministers will resign from the Council of Ministers on Friday
 sutron ne bataaya ki chaar din pehle bhi sarkaar ne apane nirnyon kii prishthbhumi ke bare main mamata se baat karne kaa prayaas kiya tha
 Mukul Rai, however, said today that no one has spoken to Mamta on behalf of the government since the decision taken on Wednesday night to withdraw support from the government
 bhaajapa ne dilli ke mukhyamantri or aam aadmi party ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal par sidhaa nishaanaa saadhaa he
 BJP has said that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal should clarify his stand regarding Congress and RJD chief Lalu Prasad
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa susheel kumaar modi ne patna main ek press vijyapti jari kar kaha, ‘kejariwal ko congress or lalu prasad ke bare main apana rukh spasht karnaa chahie
 He alleged that Nitish Kumar is the only mask of the government that is running in Bihar, the real strength is Lalu Yadav, who has been convicted on the charge of fodder scam and cannot contest elections
 lalu ke raaj main darjanon ghotaale hue or unke darjan bhar mantriyon ko jail janaa padaa tha
 Sushil said, 'tell Kejriwal whether Nitish Kumar's government in Bihar has not survived due to the same Lalu Prasad and Congress which are synonymous with corruption? Kejriwal is not supporting Nitish Kumar, the Congress symbol of corruption and Lalu Prasad, a scam advocate? 'he asked,' Did Kejriwal forget his own tweet in which he wrote Lalu Prasad crores of fodder scam i did not give any order to recover that money? What is the secret agreement for a few years' sentence and a fine of Rs 25 lakh? uttar pradesh main naa-nukur karte-karte congress or samaajawaadee party kaa gathbandhan ho to gaya lekin ise antim rup dene main jis tarah se siton kaa molbhav hua or congress ko jis tarah se samjhaute kii mudra main aana padaa usne congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii siyaasi samaj or kshamta par ek baar phir sawaal khadey kar die hai
 This is the reason why the Congress was sitting on about 150 seats as its candidates, and had to sweat it out in persuading the SP for 105 seats
 sankat ke vakt akhilesh ke saath khadi dikhi congressjis samay akhilesh yadav apane pita or chachaa ke saath party or uske chunaav chinh par kabje kii ladaai lard rahe the, us samay unke bade hue hausale kii badi vajah congress kaa parde ke peeche se mil rahaa samarthan bhi tha
 Congress leaders also announced Akhilesh's support in a number of gestures during the scuffle in the SP
 chunaav ayog main akhilesh kii pairvi ke liye jane maane vakil or congress ke varisht netaa kapil sibbal hi pahunche
 Akhilesh had promised 143 seats, Congress sympathies with Akhilesh were fully linked to political gains
 congress sutron ke mutabik akhilesh ne congress se gathbandhan karne or 143 siten uske liye chhodane par likhit sahmati di thi
 On the other hand, Mulayam Singh Yadav was against any alliance with the Congress
 yahi vajah he ki pita-putr kii is ladaai main congress ne akhilesh kaa saath diya
 The Akhilesh Election Commission changed as soon as the cycle was captured, as soon as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh justified Akhilesh's occupation of the bicycle and SP, the UP Chief Minister's attitude changed
 ve congress se siton kii saudebaaji main jute gaye or yaheen rahul gandhi siyasat main khud se nausikhia akhilesh se maat kha gaye
 Akhilesh kept reducing the number of seats again and again and the Congress continued to approve his approval
 akhilesh ne sabase tagada daanv tab chalaa jab unhone congress se baatcheet jari rahane ke dauraan hi apane pratyaashiyon kii list jari kar di
 Akhilesh's final offer to Congress was 100 seats
 akhilesh ke dhobipatak se chit hue rahulrahul ke paas ab sivaay akhilesh kii baat maanane ke koi chaara nahin rahaa
 This is also because the Congress was relaxed about an alliance with the SP and at the time the potential candidates of BSP and BJP were busy making the party air in their respective constituencies, at that time the Congress candidates would sit in the house to stop the sp's fight and get seats
 They were waiting to seal the partition
 yani agar congress akele apane dam par chunaav ladane kii koshish karti bhi to wo uske liye ek haari hui ladaai ladane jaisaa hota
 Careful talk with Priyanka and Sonia's entry at a time when it seemed that the alliance of Kikangress and SP would not happen now, party president Sonia Gandhi and Priyanka went ahead
 sutara bataate hai ki priyanka ne sidhe akhilesh se baat kii to sonia ne bhi mulaayam-akhilesh ke kareebi duusari partiyon ke diggaj netaaon ko is maamle main hastkshep karne or gathbandhan ko pariniti tak pahunchane kii koshish kii
 It was the effect of sonia-priyanka's activism that the alliance between the two parties was sealed after a few hours and the Congress was able to somehow save its nose by getting 105 seats
 pehle bhi gathbandhan ke maamle main gachha kha chuke he rahulsapa-congress ke bich gathbandhan kii is puri kavayad ko pariniti par jarur pahunchaa diya gaya ho lekin isse yahi sandesh gaya he ki rahul gandhi siyasat ke ek chote se faisle ko bhi khud apane boote anjaam tak nahin pahunchaa sake wo bhi tab jabaki akhilesh yadav ke saath unke rishte vaise nahin hai jaise ki argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav ke saath the
 Rahul Gandhi had the option of an alliance with RJD president Lalu Prasad Yadav and ljp's Ram Vilas Paswan to counter the strong alliance of Nitish Kumar and BJP in the 2010 Bihar Assembly elections but Rahul single-handedly took on Congress
 nateeja congress bihar main 6 siton par simat gai
 In the Lok Sabha elections, Rahul allied with RJD but did not climb the stage with Lalu Prasad Yadav, although in the last assembly elections of Bihar, the Congress rectified and the result is that it is a part of the ruling coalition

 mangalvaar yani hanumanji kii puja-archana kaa din or unhen prasann karne ke liye unki priy vastuon ko un par arpan karne kaa din
 It is often seen that Hanuman ji is offered vermilion and many people offer vermilion on Hanumanji even after completion of the vow
 kya aap jaanate hai ki aisa kyon kiya jaataa he?sindur chadhaane ke peeche kya kaaran yaa katha he? agar nahin to jaaniye kya kehete hai shaastra or kyon priy hai hanuman ji ko sindur
 
 
 Hanuman ji, a legend is famous in Ramayana, seeing the vermilion in the demand of Jagjanni Shree Sita ji, wonderfully asked- Mother! Why did you put this red material on the head? Sita ji was pleased at this simple matter of Brahmacharya Hanuman and said, son! By applying this my lord has longevity and he remains happy on me
 shri hanuman ne yah suna to bahut prasann hue or vichaar kiya ki jab ungali bhar sindur lagane se ayushya vruddhi hoti he to phir kyon na saare sharir par ise potkar apane swami ko ajar-amar kar duun
 Hanuman ji did the same
 saare sharir main sindur potkar sabha main pahunche to bhagwaan unhen dekhakar hanse or bahut prasann bhi hue
 Hanuman ji became more firmly convinced in the words of Mata Janaki
 kehete hai us din se hanuman ji ko is udaatt swami-bhakthi ke samaran main unke sharir par sindur chadhaaya jane laga
 Hanuman is also described in Chalisa - Ram Rasayam Tumhare Paasa, Sada Raho Raghupati's Dasa
 
 This proves that Hanuman ji is like a life-giving herb, whose worship brings energy to a physically weak devotee and remains healthy
 sindur chadhaate vakt karen is mantra kaa japashri hanuman kii pratimaa par sindur kaa chola chadhaane ja rahe hai to pehle unki pratimaa ko jal se snaan karaaen
 After this, offer all the pooja materials
 iske baadamantra kaa uccharan karte hue chameli ke telmen sindur milakar yaa sidhe pratimaa par halkaa sa desi ghi lagaakar us par sindur kaa chola chadha den
 The mantra is - vermillion blood color

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi remembered Mahatma Gandhi on his birth anniversary on 2 October and launched a nationwide cleanliness campaign
 paanch din baad, haryana main vidhansabha chunaavon ke pehle hisar main ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue unhone jawaharlal nehru ko yaad kiya or skulon ko 14 se 19 november ke bich bacchon ke liye vishesh abhiyaan kaa aayojan karne ko kaha
 November 14 is the birth anniversary of Nehru and November 19 is Indira Gandhi
 lekin uske baad 31 aktubar ko indira gandhi kii punyatithi manaane kii bajaae unhone sardaar vallabhbhai patel kii 139veen jayanti manaane kaa faisla kiya
 Congress leaders criticized it at all times, alleging that Modi and BJP were grabbing men by their icons
 vipaksh kaa yah aarope sahi bhi tha
 But what the rest of the opposition, including the Congress, was referring to was utterly shameless, in fact it was a very well thought-out tactic, whose nuances were decided in a meeting held on 22 October
 gandhi, nehru or patel rupi ye teen hi bade pratik nahin hai, jin par bijepi ne nazren gada rakhi hai
 Modi government has big plans
 uske paas aise vyaktitvon kii ek lambii suchi he
 a comprehensive list of 72 such personalities has already been prepared
 is daayre main sabhi kshetron or sabhi rajnatik dhaaraon kii shakhsiyaten hai
 These include Veer Savarkar, Deen Dayal Upadhyay and Dr
 shyama prasad mukherjee jaise apekshit dakshinpanthi diggaj hai, to isamen aise bhi naam hai jo shaayad hi kabhi bijepi ke saath jode ja sakenge
 For example, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, freedom fighter Lala Lajpat Rai, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bhimrao Ambedkar, socialist revolutionary Bhagat Singh or scientist Vikram Sarabhai and many others
 smriti irani kaa maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay (echaradi) is ‘‘mishan pratik chinh’’ main agrani rahaa he
 According to sources, the list of 72 people was broadly prepared in the Ministry of Human Resource Development, which was contributed by senior officials of the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the Vice Chancellors of some universities - being given to various emblematic personalities of modern India
 The saffron brigade has long been on the wish list to try to gauge the importance of it afresh
 swatantraaa sangram ke lagbhag sabhi bade netaa congress se nikle the
 In contrast, the saffron camp, which lacked important leaders in its camp, has tried to stake its claim on some of those leaders
 vastav main, haal ke maheenon main modi sarkaar kii ore se sardaar patel or madanamohan malviya kii viraasat par bhagava daawa karne se bhi pehle, atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar ne congress ko apni pasand ke pratik vyaktitvon ko punahsthapit karne ke liye jhidak diya tha
 Long ago, in February 2003, then President A
 pi
 J
 abdul kalam ne swatantraaa senaanee or hindu mahasabha ke netaa vir saavarkar ke ek portret kaa sansad bhawan main anaavaran kiya tha
 On its part, Modi has taken out a statewide "swami Vivekananda Yuva Vikas Yatra" in preparation for the 2012 Gujarat assembly elections, in which spiritual leader Swami Vivekananda was virtually declared a saffron icon
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye bijepi kii chunaav abhiyaan samiti ke pramukh niyukt hone ke baad modi ne gujarat main sardaar patel ke liye ‘‘stechu of unity’’ sthapit karne ke liye lohe ke tukade ikattha karne kaa ek rashtravyapee abhiyaan shuru kiya
 As Prime Minister, he gave the Bharat Ratna to Madan Mohan Malaviya, who spoke of Hindu interests and had been Congress President several times
 darasal, tamaam swatantraaa senaniyon or jivan ke anya kshetron ke pramukh bharatiyon ke mukaable nehru-gandhi parivaar ko congress ke jarurat se zyada tavajjo dene kii vajah se hi bijepi ko bhartiya shalakapurushon kaa apana varg gande kaa mauka mila
 And since the legacy of the nehru-gandhi family could not be erased, the best way to undermine their political glory was to re-introduce other people's image
 vastav main modi ne is aashay ke vyapak sanket pradhanmantri ke rup main padbhaar sanbhaalane ke ek din baad hi de die the, jab 27 may ko nehru kii punyatithi par ve unki samadhi par nahin gaye
 He had just given a Twitter message to remember the first Prime Minister
 haalanki ve sarkaar ke shuruaati din the, par ab ek vyapak suchi bana chuki sarkaar in ‘‘rashtriya pratik purushon’’ ko janata kii smriti main pesh karne ke liye vistrut yojana taiyaar kar chuki he, jo ki congress ke pratik purushon se ulat honge
 This detailed plan includes the decision of the Ministry of Human Resource Development to ask universities to set up benches in their names, build infrastructure in their memory, and organize events in memory of these celebrities
 kendriya madhyamik shiksha board (sibiesai) ne swatantraaa senaanee or tirange ke diziner pingali venkaiya par agast-2014 main jis tarah se niabandh shrunkhlaa yojit kii thi
 In a similar manner, in view of the busy winter months of the teaching session, this remembrance festival will be celebrated extensively between July and September
 22 aktubar kii baithak kii adhyakshata ucch shiksha sachiv ne kii thi or isamen ujisi ke sheersh adhikariyon or anya logon ke alaava dilli vishvavidhyalay or jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay ke kulapatiyon ne bhaag liya tha
 As part of this project, laboratories, libraries and teaching blocks will be built in their names in all schools and higher education institutions, and benches will be set up in their names
 in pratik purushon ne jin sansthaanon main kaam yaa adhyayan kiya tha, unako bhi apane prasiddh purv chaatr kaa jashn manaane ke liye kaha jayega
 Its first glimpse was seen on 25 December
 jis kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay kii sthapana malviya ne kii thi, usee main ujisi kaa ek antar vishvavidhyalay centre malviya ke naam par banane kii ghoshnaa kii gai
 Apart from this, the University Grants Commission, which has already started the foot-symbol installation campaign, has already halved the process of setting up skills (knowledge Acquisition and Upgradation of Skilled Human Abilities and Livelihood) centers in the name of Deendayal Upadhyay in all universities and colleges
 Has been dealt ujisi ne disambar main sabhi vishvavidhyalayon ke kulapatiyon ko tamil kavi subrahmanya bharti par niabandh pratiyogita kaa aayojan karne ke liye kaha tha, jo 72 logon kii is suchi main shaamil hai
 Soon the benches will be set up in the name of Swami Vivekananda, Sri Arvind and Assamese writer Lakshminath Bezbarua
 haalanki nehru or khan abdul gaffaar khan ke naam par bhi peethen sthapit karne kii ummid he, lekin yojanaon ko antim rup dene se pehle lala hardayal or purvottar ke swatantraaa senaniyon jaise vyaktitvon par or adhik jaankaree ekatrit kii ja rahi he
 In fact, the Northeast is the region where the saffron camp is trying to spread on a large scale, and the list gives a clear indication in this direction
 congress ne purvottar ko zyada ahmiyat nahin di, lekin bijepi kii suchi main use acha pratinidhitiv mila he
 These include Gopinath Bordoloi, who was the first Prime Minister of undivided Assam before independence and later became the Chief Minister

 And among many others is the spiritual and political leader of the Nagas, Queen Gaidinliu
 samajha jaataa he ki ‘‘nae yuvakon ko saath lo’’ ke siddhant par chalate hue maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ne sibiesai, kendriya vidhyalay sanghathan or navoday vidhyalay sanghathan ko mishan main shaamil hone ke liye sampark kiya he
 An official associated with this development says that as a plan, these schools can be asked to perform selective symbol men's jubilee or death anniversary programs every month
 adhikari kehete hai, ‘‘is sari kavayad ko online karaane ke liye jald hi ek tarika tay kiya jayega
 An independent agency may be included in this
 ’’ skulon or collejon ke alaava shiksha sambandhi anya sanghathan bhi shaamil ho gaye hai
 For example, in early January, the Ministry of Human Resource Development released a special module on Swami Vivekananda, titled "swami Vivekananda and Shiksha: Empowerment of Teachers and Trainers"
 ise rashtriya shikshak shiksha parishad ne swami vivekanand kii 152veen jayanti manaane ke liye taiyaar kiya tha
 The prominence of these celebrities as freedom fighters rather than Congress leaders is most evident in the cases of Gandhi and Patel
 agar patel kii congress netaa ke taur par pahchaan kii kaat-chhaant karne kii bijepi kii mahatvakanksha ke hisse ke taur par unka sammaan karne ke liye stechu of unity kaa nirmaan kiya jayega, to 30 janvari ko gandhi kii punyatithi par sarkaar mahatma gandhi par ek or dak tikat jari karegi jo modi ke svachh bharat abhiyaan par kendrit hoga
 However, top officials of the post office have reportedly expressed concern that Gandhi is being transformed into a mere symbol of cleanliness
 philhal mumkin he, yahi sab jari rahe
 The saffron family will draw new icons on their own canvas, they will add their favorite colors, with the hope that decades of emphasis on making the nehru-gandhi family a highly glorious symbol will weaken

 This was a really shocking incident for Naresh Goyal, former Jet Airways chairman, when he suffered a notoriety for landing him on an Emirates flight at Mumbai airport on 25 May
 goyal, jinaki vimaanan company ko karjadaataaon ke apatkaaleen rakam muhaiyaa karne se inkaar kar dene par 17 april ko apane tamaam vimaan khadey kar dene pade the, ko abhi giraftaar nahin kiya gaya he
 But reports suggest that the Enforcement Directorate is investigating a case of diverting money against him and the Home Ministry had taken a look out notice for him
 bataaya jaataa he ki company maamalon ke mantralay (emsie) ko jet kii khaataa-bahiyon main kai sandigdh lenden mili hai or usne puri jaanch kii sifarish kii he
 The investigation was initiated by the MCA in February this year
 sarkaar shuruaati dinon main is airline ko mili rakamon ke strot kii bhi jaanch kar rahi he
 However, all his efforts to raise funds to re-raise the airline could not take off
 jet ke upar karjadaataaon kii 8,000 karod ru
 Is a liability of Rs
 400 and he will need an emergency amount of 400 crores to continue his work
 band hone se thik pehle jet airways chah udaanen sanchalit kar rahi thi, jabaki puure kaamkaaj ke vakt uski 119 udaanen sanchalit ho rahi thim
 Government agencies are probably stepping in, driven by the fear of embarrassment that would cost them Rs 12,000 crore to Vijay Mallya, owner of the now-defunct Kingfisher and banks
 kaa chuunaa lagane ke aaropee hira kaarobaari neerav modi or mehul chokasee ke batch nikalne or videsh bhaag jane kii vajah se uthaani padi thi
 Goyal's initial refusal to relinquish control over the company led to a delay in reaching an agreement with the lenders, leading to the airline's closure
 haal hi main jet airways se istifon kaa tantaa lag gaya, jisamen siio vinay dube or siefo amit agarwal ke istife bhi hai, jiske chalate airline ke dobaaraa jinda hone kii ummiden bhi chakanachur ho gayi
 The Hinduja Group is said to have shown some interest in the jet and has Rs 1,000 crore
 se 1,500 karod ru
 We are considering investment, but such plans are certain to cast new developments
 istifon kaa tantaa lagane se jet airways ke dobaaraa jinda hone kii rahi-sahi ummiden dharashayi ho gayi

 Actually, the person who murdered the innocent is also a 9 year old child
 haalanki aaropee ke khilaaf IPC ke tahat maamla darj nahin kiya ja saktaa, isliye juvenil justise lau ke tahat karrwai kii ja rahi he
 The deceased child is named Ayush and was a student of kindergarten at St
 Francis Convent School
 10 din pehle ghar par uske mata-pita nahin the or jab ve lautakar aae to aayush gaayab tha
 When questioned nearby, the neighbors said that they saw him playing with the accused boy living in the neighborhood
 mrit balak ke parijanon ne jab padosi bachche se baat kii to usne bataaya ki vah aayush ko najadik hi ek dukaan ke paas chhod aayaa tha
 But despite inquiries around the shop, nothing was found about Aayush
 kisi anhoni kii ashanka main parijanon ne police main shikaayat kii
 After this, the police also questioned the neighboring boy, but he failed to tell anything clearly
 tab police ne aaropee bachche ke khilaaf apharan kaa maamla darj kar liya
 On Monday, 10 days after the disappearance, a factory worker saw the body of a child floating in a drain
 baad main mritak kii pahchaan aayush ke rup main kar lee gai
 Additional SP of Agra Shlok Kumar told Aaj Tak that after the body of Ayush was found, the neighboring boy and his family members were called to the police station and questioned again
 poochtacha ke dauraan pratham drushtya jo pataa chalaa uske anusaar, aayush padosi bachche ke saath khel rahaa tha, donon ke bich naale ke kareeb jhagada hua or aaropee bachche ne aayush konaale main dhakka de diya
 However, experts say that since the accused child was not intended to be murdered, this case is an accidental death
 senior fijician doctor esake kalra kaa kahana he ki 7 se 12 varsh kii umr kaa baccha agar kuch kanoon ke khilaaf karata he to us par tab tak aapraadhik maamla darj nahin ho saktaa, jab tak aparaadh kii manshaa sabit na ho jaae

 hamaare yahaan ek kahawat he, jo unke vahaan bilkul feet baith gai
 Neither home
 
 Na ghat
 phul time aatankwaad ke saath saath part time netaa banane nikle hafiz said kaa bilkul yahi hashr hua he
 He fielded 265 terrorists in the electoral fray of Pakistan
 betaa, damaad sab chunaav lard rahe the
 But Hafiz Saeed's entire team could not even open the account
 puri team zero par out ho gai
 That is, the terrorist Hafiz Saeed got beaten up badly in his house
 pakistani avam ne hafiz ko nakarapakistan ko bhi hafiz said nahin chahie
 Pakistan does not even want Hafiz's son
 pakistan ko hafiz kaa damaad bhi nahin chahie
 Pakistan does not even want Hafiz's henchmen
 hafiz said jaise aatanki pakistan ke zehan main bhale hi kitna bhi zehar bharne kii koshish kar le
 But it is clear from the result that the people of that country have given that the people of this country, who claim Rehbari of the whole country, have shot the box
 250 se zyaada aatankiyon ko chunavi maidan main utaar kar hafiz said pakistan kaa pradhanmantri banane kaa khwab dekh rahaa tha
 But the country clearly told Maulana that there is no place for Pakistani politics like Hafiz Saeed
 aatanki hafiz said kaa mishan felhafiz kaa siyaasi mansuba phuss ho gaya
 Hafiz's bail in Pakistan's elections was forfeited
 pehali hi ball par captain ne hafiz ko clin bold kar diya
 The people of Pakistan called the militant Jamaat 'khuda Hafiz'
 or is tarah se haafiz said kaa flop sho!buree tarah haari hafiz kii partypakistan kii avam ne imran ko sarkaar banane kaa mauka diya
 Nawaz and Benazir's party got respectable seats
 yahaan tak kii har choti partiyon ne siten jeetin
 a large number of independent candidates also won
 magar nahin jeeta to sirf hafiz said, uskaa kunba or uske aatankwaadi
 Its terrorists were contesting from more than 250 seats
 magar seat jeetna to dur kii baat
 In most places, the security of its terrorist candidates has been confiscated
 pakistani avam se ghar main hi pit gaya hafiz said
 Hafiz Saeed's flop show! Hafiz Talha Saeed, son of Hafiz Saeed from Sargoda, lost, while his son-in-law Hafiz Khalid Waleed from Lahore also suffered a severe defeat
 isi tarah lahore kii hi duusari seat se hafiz kaa chela kaari mohammad sheikh yaqub bhi buree tarah se haar gaya
 In cricket terms, Imran Khan and the whole of Pakistan were so washed up by Hafiz Saeed that they were ripped apart
 haalat ye hui ki mumbai hamale ke mastermind hafiz said kaa ek bhi ummidavaar chunavi ladaai main kahin najar nahin aayaa
 The candidates who had landed in 265 seats, tell you that India's most wanted terrorist Hafiz Saeed had fielded candidates in 265 seats in Pakistan
 uski allahu akbar party itani buree tareeke se to tab bhi nahin haari thi, jab wo akele ladati thi
 But Hafiz and his inmates also drowned out the party
 nateezon se saaf he ki pakistan kii avam ko ab kashmir ke naam par dehshatgardi nahin chahie
 It was decided before the terrorist's dream broke that the public is questioning their rights
 use naukari, kanoon vyavastha or ajukeshan jaisi moolbhoot chizein chahie
 However, looking at the mutual tussle between all the political parties of Pakistan, Hafiz Saeed felt that this time the Pakistani people would take him to the Prime Minister's office and then to the chair from the back door if not directly
 magar aatank ke aakaa kaa sapana tut gaya
 The mark of defeat on Hafiz Saeed's face which Hafiz Saeed had been doing election rallies till yesterday
 aaj us hafiz said kii zabaan suukh gai he
 Murdani is on the face
 galaa bharraya hua he or jubaan ladkadaa rahi he
 And why not? netaa banane chale hafiz said kii puri kii puri team apni pehali chunavi pari main jiro par out hokar siyasat ke maidan se baahar ho chuki he
 The people of Pakistan have rejected the terrorist

 The CAG audit has been questioned on the government's advertisement in a 9-point letter
 3
 In question, one has also asked, what is the basis for seeking details of advertisement expenditure of Delhi government only, why other states and central government have been kept away from such audit
 4
 The rule of audit is that the questions asked should not be subjective, but the questions asked are subjective, so it looks irrational and non-logical
 5
 Constitutional bodies like the CAG should not be influenced by political agendas and at the same time focus on political noise
 6
 The audit is conducted to investigate financial lapses and policy related violations, but the CAG has lodged an objection to the alleged irregularities in the case
 7
 The disturbances that the CAG has mentioned in cases of guideline violations are not covered by the CAG
 8
 In his letter, Sisodia has also mentioned the advertisements of the Central Government which mention the picture and name of the Prime Minister, as well as the advertisements of the Government of Telangana which are also printed in other states
 9
 Apart from this, many more points raised in the CAG audit are also under question and there is interference in the functioning of an authorized government

 apane lekh main unhone rahul gandhi par pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf ghrunit bayaanbaji kaa aarope lagaate hue unhen asafal chaatr qaraar diya
 In his Facebook post, Jaitley quoted the upa's tenure as saying that earlier Congress-led governments used to interfere with entities like RBI, judiciary and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
 jetali ne apane post kaa sheershak 'institutions under atake - da letest fabrication' rakhaa he
 He wrote that the last two months have seen a number of "fake campaigns" that failed in their motive because lies do not have longevity
 unhone kaha ki is dauraan yah log ek jhooth se duusare jhooth ke bich ulajhate rahe
 Attacking the Mamta government of West Bengal, Jaitley said that democracy in West Bengal is in serious trouble
 unhone kaha, 'bijepi ke netaaon ko jameen par nahin utarane diya gaya, saarvajanik sabhaaon ko roka gaya, rathyatra ko roak diya gaya
 The Congress Party's stance on many issues is self-contradictory
 vah kerala main camaron ke peeche gaay kii hatya karte hai or madhya pradesh main go-vadh ke khilaaf rashtriya kanoon adhinium lagu karte hai
 Jaitley said that these newly emerging breeds of institution patrons have two important characteristics
 ek taraf wo sarkaar kii aalochana karte hai or saath hi yah tark bhi dete hai ki abhivyakti kii aazaadee khatre main he
 He said, 'they shed crocodile tears for democracy and do everything possible to convert the world's largest democracy into dynasty
 'jetali ne kaha, 'congress ne haal ke chhattisgarh chunaavon main maovadiyon ke saath gathbandhan kiya
 Rahul Gandhi was seen standing shoulder to shoulder with the 'crumbling' gang at Jawaharlal Nehru University

 iske vipareet, bakaaedaaron ko management se baahar kar diya gaya or congress kaa jhooth ujagar ho gaya
 Stating that the government has consistently maintained an arm's length with the Election Commission, he said that the reason for the attack on evms is not merely to suppress the defeat in the elections but it is an attack on the Commission
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki yah vahi vipaksh he jisane pehle sargical strike par sawaal uthaae or phir ise ek niyamit karrwai qaraar diya jo ateet main bhi ho chuki he
 Jaitley said, 'the army chief was described as a' goonda of the road '
 ladaaku vimaan rafel deal or isaki prakriya ko lekar vaayu sena par gambhir andeh uthaae gaye
 Despite this, they allege that the central government is attacking the institute and making fun of them
 'arabiai ke masale par jetali ne kaha ki ateet main congress kii sarkarein kendriya bank ke governron ko tyaagptr dene ke liye kehane main udaaravaadi rahi hai
 He said, 'pandit Nehru, Mrs
 Indira Gandhi and then Yashwant Sinha had asked the governors to step down
 upie sarkaar ke dauraan aisa kai baar hua
 But nothing of this sort has happened in recent times
 'jetali ne kaha ki sarkaar sibiai yaa kisi anya jaanch agency ke kisi bhi jaanch kaary main hastkshep nahin karti he
 He said that by restoring the credibility of an investigative agency, the institution is strengthened and not attacked
 They did their worst
 We did our best
 Democracy won in Uttarakhand! The BJP again reiterated its demand that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh should resign on moral grounds in the 2-G spectrum scam, to which the Congress reacted sharply, saying that the opposition party has been meaninglessly the same rant
 bhaajapa chaahati he ki pradhanmantri ko is ghotaale kii naitik jimmedaari leni chahie
 The BJP has also demanded that the Congress should apologize for accusing the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government of having links with the controversial corporate lobbyist Neera Radia
 nayi dilli main congress pravaktaa manish tiwari ne kaha ki bhaajapa bina kisi thos aadhaar ke baar baar ek hi baat doharaa rahi he
 On the bjp's demand for the Prime Minister's resignation on moral grounds, Tiwari said that the Congress and the UPA government took action as soon as the matter of corruption came to light, but the BJP did nothing in any matter from Bangaru Laxman to Yeddyurappa
 isse pehle bhaajapa ne aaj congress par bhrashtachar tathaa 2ji spectrum ghotaalaa maamle kii taraf se janata kaa dhyaan hataane ke liye tarah-tarah ke hatkande apnaane kaa aarope lagaaya
 bjp's chief spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters in Lucknow, "A person named Dheeraj Rao, close to a well-known Congress-affiliated house in Haryana, has made baseless allegations against BJP leaders
 ’unhone aarope lagaaya, ‘vah congress kaa khadaa kiya vyakti he
 That party is adept at adopting such tactics to divert public attention from the real issues
 ’ prasad ne kaha ki raav ne bhaajapa ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani par 2ji spectrum maamle ko lekar vivaadon main ghiri nira radia ke trust kaa udghaatan karne kaa aarope lagaaya he, jabaki asaliyat yah he ki adwani pejawar swami ke trust kaa udghaatan karne ke liye gaye the
 He said that the allegations made against BJP President Nitin Gadkari in Mumbai's Adarsh society scam case have also proved unfounded and party leader Ananth Kumar has also sent a legal notice to the accused
 bhaajapa netaa ne congress se maang kii ki vah adwani se maafee maange
 He said, 'this is not the first time that the Congress is adopting such tactics
 vah purv main bhi aisa karti rahi he
 Prasad said that the BJP is demanding the formation of a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to investigate the 2G spectrum scam because the scope of the Public Accounts Committee is very limited
 prasad ne kaha, ‘hamane bade baari man se sansad kii kaarywahi thap karne kaa faisla kiya tha, lekin agar ham itnaa sakht kadam nahin uthaate to doorsanchaar mantri e
 The king does not resign
 prakaran kii sibiai jaanch samet is maamle main jo bhi karrwai hui he vah hamaare dwaara banaae gaye dabaav ke kaaran hi hui he
 He said that the biggest question is why Congress is hesitant to fulfill the demand of JPC
 vah bhi tab jab congress kaa hi sadsy is samiti kaa adhyaksh banegaa
 The BJP leader said, 'it is not a matter of the CBI to investigate some of the questions raised in the tape of Neera Radia
 ve sawaal hai ki kaise ek khaas netaa ko mantri banane ke liye raajnneeti ko prabhavit kiya gaya or kaise karporate labing kii gai
 The answer to these questions should be found by the Parliament itself
 ’ congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi par nishaanaa sadhate hue unhone kaha ki hindu aatankwaad ko bada khatra qaraar dekar rahul pakistan kii mithyaa prachaar kii muhim main madad kar rahe hai
 Describing the 2G spectrum scam as the country's biggest embezzlement since independence, Prasad said that the Prime Minister should resign, taking moral responsibility for it
 unhone kaha, ‘aise vakt main jab mantri janata kii gadhi kamai kaa dhan lut rahe hai, pradhanmantri ko isaki naitik jimmedaari leni chaiye
 Prasad said that the BJP will not back down from its demand to get the 2G spectrum scam case investigated by the JPC

 Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday accused the central government of causing onion scarcity in Delhi
 rashtriya rajdhani kshetra main pyaaj 100 rupee kilo ho gaya he
 Addressing the media along with Food and Civil Supplies Minister Imran Hussain, Sisodia said that the central government had failed to fulfill the assurance it had given on 5 September to provide onions in Delhi
 unhone kaha ki yaa to centre kii laaparvaahee se pyaaj stock main kharaab ho jane ke kaaran keemton main betahasha vruddhi hui he yaa jamaakhoron ko laabh pahunchane kii buree manshaa rahi he
 Sisodia said that people are upset with the rising prices of onions
 unhone kaha, "yah puure desh kaa maamla he, lekin dilli main centre sarkaar jaanboojhkar killat (pyaaj kii) paidaa kar rahi he
 Despite repeated demands from the Delhi government, the Onion Center has stopped giving onions
 "centre sarkaar ne paanch sitambar ko patr likhakar dilli sarkaar ko kaha tha ki uske paas 56,000 ton pyaaj he or vah apni aavashyaktaanusaar pyaaj le sakati he
 Sisodia said, "soon the Delhi government informed that it would take 10 truck onions (2
 5 lakh kilo) rojaanaa lekar saste daam par bechegi taaki jamkhori par lagaam lage
 "he also demanded provision of onions on a daily basis till December 9
 dilli ke upmukhyamantri ne bataaya ki haalanki centre sarkaar ne 10 trek ke bajaae sirf 3-4 trek pyaaj muhaiyaa karavaaya
 He said, "we have formed teams and opened onion sale centers at a cheaper rate in each assembly seat
 centre sarkaar ne patr main jo daawa kiya tha vah pyaaj kaa stock kahaan he? usne pyaaj ke bade stock ko kyon sadane diya? " unhone bataaya ki 24 november ke baad ek trek bhi pyaaj nahin muhaiyaa karavaaya gaya
 The AAP leader said, "despite the claim that there is a huge stock of onions, not giving onion indicates that the central government is probably creating scarcity to benefit the hoarders
" "hossain ne kaha ki dilli sarkaar ne mobile vine, uchit mulya kii dukaan va aavashyaktaanusaar logon ko lagaakar buniyadi suvidhaayen taiyaar kii he
 He said, "I urge Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan to provide onion so that it can be sold at a cheaper price in the national capital

 ' degatraryov shaadishuda hai, jinke 2 bete hai
 Dagataryov is the candidate for the mayor's election in Moscow on 8 September
 unhone kaha ki periods se mahilaon kii thakaan main jabardast ijapha hota he
 It also leads to a decline in women's ability to work and memory
 duusari ore, maanavadhikaar kaaryakartaaon ne mahilaon ko is tarah kii khaas suvidha die jane kii baat ko hi sire se khaarij kar diya he
 Anna Sobko, who has been associated with a group working for human rights in Russia for a long time, said that such a demand for women is unclear and completely irrational
 baharhaal, degatraryov mahilaon ko kitni khaas suvidhaayen dilava pate hai, yah to aane vaala vakt hi batayega
 But his demand has started a long debate

 is
 khabaron ke mutabik is din ko manaane kii ghoshnaa khud sanyukt raashtra kii sabha ne 2010 main kii thi

 When we went on 15 October, we found that this day is celebrated as International Day of Rural Women, which has no relation with Abdul Kalam
 bataa den ki har de ke link par clic kar aap ye jaan sakate hai ki ye din kyon manaaya jaataa he
 It is clear that there is no International Day like World Students Day, nor was it announced by the United Nations in 2010
 agar vishwa chaatr diwas naam kaa koi international de hota to yah duniya bhar main manaaya jaataa or videshi media bhi is par koi khabar prakashit karti
 However every year Indian media celebrates World Students Day on 15 October
 vikipedia par bhi isko lekar jo jaankaree di gai he wo bhartiya media se hi lee gai he
 Not only this, many leading leaders of India have also tweeted linking World Students' Day with Abdul Kalam
