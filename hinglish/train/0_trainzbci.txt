 master blaster sachin tendulkar ne bhale hi cricket se sanyas le liya he, lekin khilaadiyon ke liye 'ballebaazi' karnaa nahin choda he
 They want Rosie's care not to take away the skills of a player
 khilaadiyon kii naukari ko lekar bharat ratna sachin tendulkar bhi phikrmand hai or unhone khilaadiyon kii naukari kii suraksha ko lekar aawaaj uthaai he
 Sachin has demanded that multinational companies start giving jobs to the players
 mauka tha mumbai police gymkhana ke 69wein police aamantran shield ke final kaa, jise karnataka sporting association ne emayeeji cricket club ko haraakar jeeta
 On this occasion, Sachin said, 'the players who were previously contracted were few, the players had job security which is not there today
 pehle khilaadiyon ko duusari chizon ke bare main sochane kii zarurat nahin thi
 He used to pay full attention to the game
 naukari kii chintaa khilaadiyon ke pradarshan par asar daalati he 
 That is why i will appeal to all the multinational companies to start giving jobs to the players, support them and give them security
 'tippaniyan There are now 14 players playing in the school league in Mumbai
 yah idia bhi 'master blaster kaa tha
 The motive behind this was to give more opportunities to the players
 unhone kaha, 'ye thodaa der se aayaa, lekin na aane se thik he 
 
 
 i think a career in inter school is 48 months
 
 
 jisamen pich condishans ahm hoti hai
 That's why i wanted more players to get a chance
 ' Significantly, earlier players used to get government jobs as well, but this figure kept decreasing in the midst of increasing population and decreasing jobs
 ab aasraa nijee companiyon se he
 As such, the Sports Ministry has proposed that those who win the Olympic, Asian Games or World Championships get direct 'A' and 'B' jobs, earlier these sports were not available under the sports quota
 sachin kii guzarish nijee companiyon se he lekin unke kad ko dekhte hue ho saktaa he khilaadiyon kii naukari ko lekar sakaaratmak ruukh sab rakhen
 The occasion was the final of the 69th Police Invitation Shield of Mumbai Police Gymkhana, which was won by Karnataka Sporting Association beating MIG Cricket Club
 is maukey par sachin ne kaha, 'pehle anubandhit khilaadi kam the, khilaadiyon ke paas naukari kii suraksha thi jo aaj nahin he
 First players did not have to think about other things
 ve puraa dhyaan khel par lagaate the
 Job concerns affect players' performance
 isaliye main sabhi bahurashtriya companiyon se apil karuunga ki ve khilaadiyon ko naukari dena shuru karen, unka samarthan karen unhen suraksha den
 Comments mumbai main skool lig main ab 14 khilaadi khel rahe hai
 This idea was also of the 'master blaster'
 iske peeche kaa makasad khilaadiyon ko adhik maukey dena tha
 He said, 'it came a little late, but not coming
 
 
 mere khyaal se inter skool main kariyar 48 maheene kaa hota he 
 
 
 In which pitch conditions are important
 isaliye main chahta tha ki zyada khilaadiyon ko mauka mili
 ' gauratlab he ki pehle khilaadiyon ko sarkari naukari bhi mil jaati thi, lekin badhati aabaadi or ghatati naukariyon ke bich ye aankada ghatata gaya
 Now Asra is from private companies

 Thank you for your affection & support; tomorrow when i engage with you it will not be as President but as a citizen # presidentmukherjee gujarat ke vadodara main rishton kaa katl karata ek sansanikhej maamla saamne aayaa he
 Here a five-month-old pregnant girl has made a serious accusation against her father
 usne police ko bataaya ki uski kokh main pal rahaa baccha uske pita kaa he
 Police have arrested the accused father
 vadodara ke makadpura ilaake kii rahane vaali 19 saal kii peedita ne bataaya ki jab vah 14 saal kii thi, tabhi se uske pita uske sathrepakar rahe hai
 Havan's father threatened to kill the victim on opening his mouth
 peedita kii maa is baat se puri tarah bekhbar thi
 Two days ago, the accused father raped his daughter
 us dauraan usne pita se pet main dard hone kii baat kahi
 a father blinded by lust, he asked him to go to the doctor
 peedita ke pet main asahneeya dard hone ke baad uski maa use doctor ke paas le gai
 After examination, the doctor informed her mother Kopita's pregnancy
 yah sunakar uski maa ke pairon tale jameen khisak gai
 When the mother asked him strictly about this, the victim cried crying, 'my father has a child in my womb
 'peedita kii maa use fouran police stesan lekar gai or apane pati ke khilaaf shikaayat darj karai
 Based on the statements of the victim, the police has registered a case against the accused and arrested him
 philhal peedita kaa ilaaj jari he
 The police is investigating the case
 kanpur ke hotel kanha gallexi main 11 july ko upi main party ke mahasampark abhiyaan kii samiksha karne pahunche bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah puri rau main the
 His enthusiasm for the unilateral victory in the Bihar elections was filled with happiness
 party netaaon ke bich dahaadte hue ve bole, “bijepi upi main 2017 kaa vidhansabha chunaav fatah karegi or agle 25 varsh tak party kii satta pradesh main kaayam rahegi
 "but the Bihar election results have shattered one dream of Shah and now another dream has come to the test
 8 november ko aae bihar chunaav nateezon ne upi bijepi ko sannaate main laa diya
 Amidst this silence, BJP national vice president and UP in-charge Om Mathur reached UP BJP headquarters at 10 am on November 16 for the first time after the Bihar elections were over
 pehle sanghathan chunaav ke kshetra prabhariyon or baad main vidhanmandal dal kii baithak main maathur ne behad chaturaai ke saath party ke sahame hue netaaon se bihar kii koi charchaa nahin kii lekin padaadhikariyon se alag-alag mulaakaat kar upi bijepi ke bhavi “khewanhaar” ke bare main unka man jarur tatola
 BJP may have lost the election in Bihar, but its challenges have increased in UP
 bihar kii bhaanti upi main bhi iske saamne majboot kshetreey rajnatik partiyaan hai jinka tod shah ke sipahasalaron ke paas philhal to nahin dikh rahaa
 These challenges have suddenly exposed bjp's weaknesses in UP
 adhuri he chehre kii talashpichley loksabhaa chunaav main upi se 71 saansad jitaane vaali bijepi dedh varsh bitne ke baad bhi koi aisa “cheharaa” taiyaar nahin kar pai he jo party netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ke bich sarvamaanya ho
 Organizational elections have started in the state
 bihar chunaav ke baad bane maahaul ne bijepi sheersh netritv kii duvidha ko badha diya he
 The party is unable to decide which caste leader to hand over the command of the state
 haalanki sheersh str par upi ke ek darjan netaaon ke naam par charchaa shuru hui he jinhen vidhansabha chunaav se pehle saamaajik samikarnon ko durust karne liye badi jimmedaariyaan saunpi ja sakati hai
 a faction associated with the bjp's top leadership is advocating that the party president in UP be handed over to an OBC leader immediately, while a faction as Laxmikant Bajpayee advocates not changing the Brahmin face to the post
 bihar chunaav main buree tarah maat khai bijepi ab un sambhaavnaaon ko bhi tatolane ja rahi he jisamen nabbe ke dashak main calraj mishra-kalyaan singh kii jodi kii tarj par brahman pradesh adhyaksh ke saath kisi obisi chehre ko mukhyamantri pad kaa daavedaar ghoshit kar aglaa vidhansabha chunaav ladaa jaae
 However, the party does not currently see an OBC leader like Kalyan Singh who has the support of other castes as well
 kamjor kadi bani dalit siyasatvarsh 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko upi main 21 fisadi hissedari rakhane vaale dalit varg ke ek bade hisse kaa samarthan mila tha lekin kuch hi maheene baad hue vidhansabha upachunaavon main yah tabaka party se dur dikhaai diya tha
 Meanwhile, in order for the Dalit leadership to emerge, the BJP nominated Agra MP Ramshankar Katheria in the Union Council of Ministers but even after a year, he has not been able to leave his mark as the Dalit face of the BJP
 katheria dhanuk birdari se aate hai
 The Dalits constitute 30 per cent of the Dalit population and the Dhanukas constitute only two per cent of them
 is aankade ke aadhaar par katheria ke saamne daliton yaa phir ati daliton ko bijepi se jodgaye kii chunauti pahaad sareekhee hi he
 Professor in the Department of Sociology at Banaras Hindu University, Dr
 ajit kumaar bataate hai, “2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi kaa pradarshan is baat par bahut kuch nirbhar karegaa ki vah bispi ke dalit vot bank main kitni send laga paati he
 Apart from Mayawati's core votebank Jatav, BJP has not been able to find any effective face of Pasi and other fraternity even among Dalits
 so netaaon kii kami se jujh rahi bijepi ne un netaaon ke liye apane daravaaje khol die hai jo yaa to bispi se nikaale ja chuke hai yaa phir haashie par daal die gaye hai
 The "jana Sangh Model" remembered was the party booth of the party organization in the era of the Jana Sangh
 upi main sanghathan kii punarrachana karne main juty bijepi ne “jansangh model” kii tarj par gram or ward ko sanghathan kii praathmik ikai na maanate hue booth ko praathmik ikai mana he
 By this model, the BJP has started activating party democracy up to the booth level through organizational elections in UP
 sanghathanaatmak chunaav kii ghoshnaa ke saath hi ek baar phir jod-tod kaa khel shuru ho gaya he
 These contenders have also jumped into the fray for the 2017 assembly elections in the battle of district and division president elections
 tikat ke daavedaar har keemat par apana adhyaksh jitaane kii jod-tod main jute gaye hai taaki party main sthaneey str par samarthan jutaya ja sake
 For BJP, which is facing factionalism and infighting, organizational elections will add fuel to the fire which will not be good for its health before the assembly elections
 haalanki party ke sanghathanaatmak chunaav prabharee or chandauli se saansad mahendranath pandeya isse inkaar karte hue kehete hai, “bijepi ke sanghathanaatmak chunaav sanghathan parv kii tarah hai
 The possibility of controversy in this is baseless
 ”2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav se pehle upi bijepi ke sanghathan main badlaav bhale na ho, lekin party kaa karyaalay vaastu ke lihaaj se badal rahaa he
 Glass walls and gleaming white tiles on the floor will give the BJP office a "corporate" look like a corporate office
 inhen badlaavon ke bich bijepi ke saamne sabase badi chunauti shoshiton or vanchiton kii party banane kii bhi he
 This will form the basis of bjp's victory

 1
 kya aap jaanate hai dakshin disha main bani ghar kii kisi bhi diwaar par ghadi taangna ashubh hota he
 It should always be avoided

 3
 vaastu ke mutabik ghar yaa offis kii deevaaron par pandalam clock yani ghante vaali ghadi lagaana acha hota he

 shaadi-shuda jivan kaa bharpoor anand lene waalon ko bhi apane bed se deevar ghadi dur hi rakhni chahie
 6
 vaastu main diwaar par tangi kharaab ghadi ko bhi ashubh mana jaataa he
 Immediately repair any closed clock in the house and then put it on the wall

 After the meeting, Lalu Yadav told the media after the meeting with 80 mlas of LJRJD that Nitish did not ask for Tejashwi's resignation nor asked for clarification
 lalu ne kaha- jahaan bhi unhen or tejasvi ko apni baat rakhni hogi vahaan rakhenge
 Lalu said that Nitish is the leader of the Grand Alliance government
 argedy sarkaar ke har kadam kaa sakriy samarthan karegi
 The meeting of RJD mlas was chaired by Rabri Devi
 argedy ne saaf kar diya ki vidhaan mandal main tejasvi rahenge
 Tejashwi will not resign: After a meeting with Rabri vidhyaks, Rabri Devi said that all allegations on Tejashwi Yadav are false and they will not resign
 rabari devi ne kaha ki bijepi hamen fansaane kii sajeesh kar rahi he
 Rabri Devi hit out at BJP leader Sushil Modi, saying that he is an outsider and has nothing to do with Bihar
 bahari log bihar kaa vikaas nahin hone dena chaahate isliye hamaare kaam main baadha daalana chaahate hai
 Tejashwi Yadav also gave a clarification: CM Tejashwi Yadav has also denied the resignation
 tejasvi ne kaha ki mujhase kabhi bhi istife ke liye nahin poocha gaya
 Tejashwi accused the BJP-RSS of conspiring to break the grand alliance in Bihar
 unhone bijepi netaa susheel kumaar modi ko bahari bataate hue kaha ki unhen bihar ke vikaas or janata kii chintaa nahin he
 Shivanand Tiwari raised questions on Nitish Meanwhile, Shivanand Tiwari, who is close to RJD chief Lalu Prasad, has questioned Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 unhone kaha he ''main nitish ji or bhrashtachar par unki jiro tolerance kii niti ko 40 saal se jaanata hum
 If the burrows are uprooted then it will go further

 In the previous meeting, RJD flatly denied Tejashwi's resignation
 do din pehle nitish ne kyon bulaai baithak?pehle se kaha ja rahaa tha ki nitish raashtrapati chunaav ke baad koi bada faisla le sakate hai
 After returning from Delhi on Tuesday, Nitish called a meeting on Wednesday
 pehle ye baithak 28 july ko hone vaali thi
 It is worth noting that on July 11 too, a meeting of the JDU Legislature Party was convened at Nitishke Government House 1, Annay Marg, demanding that Tejashwi Yadav, who is being accused of corruption, resign from his post
 needed
 haalanki, us dauraan aisi maang ko lekar jaldbaaji na karte hue nitish ne tejasvi ko apane upar bhrashtachar ke lage aaropon kaa janata ke bich main jawaab dene ke liye kaha tha
 It is believed that due to lack of satisfied full response from Tejashwi in the last 15 days, the legislative party meeting on Wednesday may once again demand strong action against Tejashwi
 is baithak main is baat ko lekar maang uthne kii sambhaavna he ki tejasvi par nitish kumaar koi thos nirnay len or unhen apane mantrimandal se barkhaast karen

 It is clear from this bugle about 18 months before the election that the challenge before the BJP is not only in the states where the vote share it is getting is not turning into a seat, but also in those states where it is in the top vote share as well
 The opposition was successful in blowing dust
 iske chalate party adhyaksh amit shah kii ranneeti ke liye jahaan 42 loksabhaa siton vaala pashchim bengal ahm he, vahiin 80 siton vaala uttar pradesh bhi ranneeti ke kendra main he
 In both these states, Amit Shah faces Mamata Banerjee and Mayawati and only by defeating one of these two can the BJP meet its target
 bengal ke prabharee se shah ne maange 1
 5 crore votes Amit Shah has in charge of West Bengal 1 in keeping with the victory in the 2019 general elections

 If BJP 1 from the state in 2019
 5 karod vot paati he to rajya ke chunaavon main uskaa vot share badhkar 28-30 fisadi tak pahunch jayega
 Due to this vote share, Amit Shah is expected to get at least 28–32 seats from West Bengal in 2019

 At the same time, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP won 71 seats with 42 percent vote share
 duusari ore mayawati ko loksabhaa chunaavon main 20 fisadi vot share mila lekin ek bhi seat jeetne main unki party safal nahin hui
 And in the 2017 assembly elections, she was able to win just 19 seats with 22 percent vote share

 That is, in order to meet the target of 300 seats for BJP in 2019, it is necessary to defeat one of Mayawati and Mamta in Uttar Pradesh and Paschim Bengal

 The government reversed its stand after declaring homosexual relations as grossly unethical, declaring them out of the category of crime
 jiske baad ucchtam nyaayalay kii peeth ne naaraazgi vyakt kii
 Additional Solicitor General PP Malhotra, on behalf of the Ministry of Home Affairs, argued that homosexual relations are against the social order and Indian society cannot adopt prevalent practices abroad
 eesg malhotra ne nyaayamurti jies singhvi or nyaayamurti esaje mukhopadhyaay kii peeth ke samaksh kaha, ‘samalangik sambandh nihaayat hi aniatik hai or saamaajik vyavastha ke khilaaf hai or is tarah kii gatividhiyon se bimaariyaan (aids jaisi) failane kii kaaphi adhik sambhaavna he
 As soon as the media began to describe the government's stand, the Home Ministry immediately distanced itself from the statement of the ASG, issuing a statement in the midst of the court proceedings saying that it did not comment on the Delhi High Court's decision to legalize homosexual relations
 Has not expressed stance
 bayaan main kaha gaya he, ‘grih mantralay ne samalangikta ke mudde par koi rukh akhriyaar nahin kiya he
 The Home Ministry has not given any other instructions other than to convey the decision of the cabinet
 ’ usne bataaya ki atarni general se sheersh nyaayalay ko sirf sahyog karne ko kaha gaya he
 The Ministry of Home Affairs said that the matter was considered by the Cabinet and the decision of the Cabinet was that the Central Government could not appeal against the decision of the Supreme Court
 jaise hi malhotra ne kareeb chaar ghante tak chali kaarywahi ke baad apni daleelein samaapt kin, ek anya eesg mohan jain ne adaalat se kaha ki unhen yah sandesh dene kaa nirdesh diya gaya he ki centre is mudde par koi rukh akhriyaar nahin kar rahaa
 Registering a strong objection to Jain's arguments at the last minute, the bench said that the government has already submitted its arguments and the court cannot take cognizance of the instructions given to them
 peeth ne sarkari vakil se kade lahaze main kaha, ‘adaalat main is tarah ke bayaan nahin den
 This will only trouble you
 ’ peeth ne kaha, ‘bharat sarkaar maamle main daleel rakh rahi he
 He has made his arguments
 ham aapako is tarah kaa bayaan nahin dene denge ki grih mantralay ne eesg malhotra ko nirdesh nahin diya
 We are not taking your instructions into consideration
 ’jab jain ne kaha ki sarkaar halafanama daakhil karegi to peeth ne kade swar main kaha ki isaki jarurat nahin he kyonki maamle main antim sunwaayee shuru ho chuki he or unhen maamle main adaalat kii sahaayta karne kii puri aazaadee he
 When contacted later, Malhotra insisted that he was appearing for the Home Ministry
 adaalat ne agali sunwaayee ke liye 28 farvari kii taarikh mukarrar kii
 Earlier, Malhotra had said in the court, 'our constitution is different and our moral and social values are also different from other countries, so we cannot follow them
 ’ unhone daleel di ki samalangik sambandhon kii saamaajik naamanzoori apane aap main ise aparaadh maanane kaa paryaapt kaaran he
 These are unnatural therefore crimes
 unhone dilli ucch nyaayalay ke faisle kaa virodh karte hue kaha ki bhartiya samaaj samalangikta ko manjuur nahin karata or kanoon ko samaaj se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In 2009, the Delhi High Court decided to exclude gay sex from the category of crime
 bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 377 main samalangik sambandhon ko aparaadh bataaya gaya he jisamen umrakaid tak kii adhiktam sajaa kaa praavdhaan he
 The Supreme Court yesterday asked organizations challenging the legality of homosexual relations to explain the laws applicable to the subject in other countries
 sheersh adaalat ne samalangikta virdohi adhikaar samoohon se kaha ki ucch nyaayalay ke faisle par virodh darj karaate hue dayera badhayen or unhen keval jismani sambandhon tak simit nahin rakhen
 The bench had said that homosexuality should be viewed from the perspective of a changing society as many things which were previously rejected have become acceptable over time

 gautam (singhania) ne sonia (garwaare) or lalit (modi) se aisi sports car ke bare main baat karnaa shuru kiya jise ve khareednaa chaahate the
 He said, "it looks so overwhelming in orange color that you can't even imagine
" ” vahaan itane saare logon, apane doston, ke saath baithe hue mujhe apane andar aisa mahasoos ho rahaa tha ki main yahaan koi bahari insaan hum
 
 
 This was a new group of us and yet we all had to know a lot about each other
 jayadeep (garwaare) balakani main gaye or unhone ek ladki ko drink ofer kiya
 
 
 We were on the fifteenth floor and there was a tremendous view from there
 jamkar sharaab pi ja rahi thi, apartment ke bheetar (mumbai main) kii bheed madhoshi ke sagar main gote laga rahi thi
 Some people had small packets in their hands and would go into the bathroom in groups of two or sometimes three, cocaine was not so common then, but the smoke of the hashish was quite high
 aise group main akasar koi ek ladkaa hota tha jo do yaa teen ladakiyon ko pataakar apane saath 'kash’ lagane ko le jaataa tha
 
 
 Together the charas rolls were prepared and the girls puffed up
 main unako ladkadaate dekhtaa, unki ankhen bhavashunya ho jaati thim
 
 
 i used to get very upset after seeing all this
 har koi yah jaan chukaa tha ki mujhe in chizon ke liye majaboor nahin kiya ja saktaa—ve isaki koshish kar chuke the, main tus-se-mas nahin hua
 It was a part of my life where the pressure from my friends would have no effect
 drugs, cigarette, sharaab—main inamen se kisi ko haath tak nahin lagaana chahta tha, lekin isse kai baar 'tamaasha’ khadaa ho jaataa tha
 This group of special people used to do everything and i was allowed to watch
 gautam kahata tha, 'yash ke liye or pani lao’ or har koi hansane lagata tha
 i got used to all this
 ***main soch rahaa tha, aaj kii raat mjedaar hogi
 The nightclub on the ground floor at the hotel (singapore) was packed
 bombai main bhi har koi jamkar masti karata tha, lekin unhen hameshaa thodaa chaukanna bhi rahanaa padataa tha
 They had to save their family names; Had to preserve his reputation
 lekin yahaan kisi ko koi parvaah nahin thi
 While we were sitting, a familiar looking woman came close to our table
 vah air india kii air hostes thi or hamane bombai airport par use dekha tha
 Gautam found her attractive and Jaideep immediately went close to her and asked where her flight was now
 use singapore janaa tha or donon raji ho gaye ki ve agle kuch din vahaan saath bithaayenge
 
 
 i mustered up courage to ask the air hostess if she would dance with me
 
 
 jab main air hostes ke saath dance karne laga to jai or sujatha ko dekh rahaa tha jo ek kone main dance kar rahe the
 It seemed that both of them have deep love
 duusari ore, meri dance partner thodi hi der main bahekane lagi
 She was touching my shoulders and started gently stroking the hair on the back of my head
 vah aakarshak thi, lekin main satark tha
 i had many experiences from which it came to know that girls came close to me just because of my family name
 aise rishte ek nishchit oonchai tak aage badhate the, lekin aakhir main hameshaa yah mere liye vifal sabit hote the
 She wanted to be with me not because of me but because of my family
 birla sarnem unke liye kuch myne rakhata tha jise main kabhi bhi puri tarah samaj nahin paaya
 
 
 i decided to rest for a while and headed towards my room
 
 
 main bathroom se niklaa hi tha ki ghanti bajane kii aawaaj suni
 
 
 i walked up to the door and tried to sneak out of the peephole
 yah koi asian aurat thi
 
 
 'what can i help you with?' i asked him
 usne jawaab diya, 'main aapse milane ai hum’ or vah ek tarah se mujhe pare dhakelte hue kamare main ghus gai
 Dressed in fishnet stockings and miniskirts, the woman had long hair and was coming down her back
 usne kaaphi mechap kiya hua tha or gaal to aise the jaise laal rang se paint kar die gaye hon
 His top was of red fluffy cloth which was tightly affixed to his body and his nails were quite long and pointed
 vah bade aaraam se mere bistar par ek kinare baith gai
 Keeping the door open, i told him, 'I think you have entered the wrong room number
 ’ usne kaha, 'tum yash ho?’ maine kaha, 'ji haa, yah meraa hi naam he
 'he insisted,' Then there is the right room number! You sit down! ' i thought it was a joke
 kya yah aurat koi veshya he?main ab bhi yah pachaa nahin paa rahaa tha ki mere kamare main aurat baithi hui he jiskaa kahana he ki use 'mere liye’ bheja gaya he
 i asked her, 'what can i do for you?' He pointed to the bed and said, 'hum, you will enjoy boom-boom
 
 
 ’maine us mahila ko samajhate hue kaha, 'suno, mujhe tumhaari jarurat nahin he
 'she was a prostitute of Philippines descent and certainly i was not interested in her
 saath hi, mere doston main yah koi gupt baat nahin rah gai thi ki main abhi tak virgin tha
 It was even more uncomfortable for me to have a physical relationship with a woman like this for the first time
 apane kandhe ke strap kholte hue usne kaha, 'main apane kapade utaaruun?’ maine turant hi atakaey hue kaha, 'nahin, nahin ruko
 We talk 
 
 ’maine us aurat ko samajhane kii koshish kii, 'main jaanata hum ki tumhaare liye parivaar kii jimmedaari uthaanaa bahut ahm he, lekin yah dhandha bahut bura he
 You should not do this
 
 
 ’ usne kaha, 'main jaanati hum! lekin paisa kahaan se aayega?’ maine kaha, 'tum kisi store main naukari kyon nahin karti? tum haseen ho, tum chaaho to koi bhi doosraa kar sakati ho
 He immediately replied, "if I'm beautiful, why don't you have fun with me?" i was stuck
 
 
 maine kamjor-sa bahaanaa banaaya: 'meri tabiyat thik nahin he
 'he placed a hand on my forehead which was as cold as ice
 usne kaha, 'tumhen bukhaar to nahin he!’ uskaa haath dur jhatakate hue maine use lagaataar samajhane kii koshish kii ki use koi or kaam karnaa chahie
 This sermon of mine lasted for about 20 minutes, until finally the woman contemptuously said that she wanted to do something in return for the money that someone had given her and got out of the room
 
 When i went outside, Sujata and Jai were seen peeping out of a room
 ve mujhe dekh rahe the
 i asked him, 'what was all this?' He closed the door completely and started laughing loudly
 jab maine daravaaje ko jor-jor se peetna shuru kiya to sujatha ne use kholaa or mere chehre ko sahanubhuti se dekhne lagi
 Inside, Jaideep and Jai were laughing out loud with their hands raised on the floor
 maine poocha, 'yah sab kisne kiya he?’ jayadeep ne kaha, 'guddu, ham tumhaare daravaaje par kaan lagaae sab kuch sun rahe the
 'I turned red with shame
 ab bhi hansate hue jai chillaakar bolaa, 'guddu ne to usko bhaashan dekar vidaa kar diya!’ main ab bhi nahin samaj paa rahaa tha ki isamen koun-si aisi chutkule vaali baat thi jo meri samaj se baahar thi
 Jaideep said, 'yash! We used to think that your virginity will be dissolved today
 ’ nishchit taur par usne meri dukhati rag ched di thi
 In the end, i came to know that Lalit Modi has sat in Bombay and has asked some people to do all this
 gautam or jayadeep is majaak kaa hissaa the or lalit ne to na jane kaise mere dead ko bhi isamen shaamil hone ke liye manaa liya tha
 
 
 Sitting in Bombay, Lalit and my dad were getting instant news
 
 
 'ab wo kamare main gai he, yash usko kuch bol rahaa he, ye acha nahin he
 
 
 She ran away from fear of speech
 ’ main sirf kalpana kar saktaa hum ki unhone kya bataaya hoga

 Railways has decided to give refund of 5000 or more in ticket cancellation to the account of the person concerned to avoid cash problem in booking tickets from the PRS counter
 isse pehle 10 november ko khate main rifund kii limit 1 xxrep 4 0 se zyada kii thi
 According to the top railway officials, this has been done for two reasons, the first reason is that the railway counter has to face the problem of cash
 zyaadaatar log tikat booking ke liye 500 or 1000 rupee ke note lekar hi aa rahe hai kyonki railway ko 24 taarikh tak puraane note lene ke liye nirdesh mili hai lihaaja logon ko manaa bhi nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Most people are coming with big notes only on the railway counter due to this, due to this there is a big problem of broken money
 doosraa sabase bada kaaran yah he ki jo log apane kaale paise ko safed karne kii ummid main railway main tikat book karana chaah rahe hai to aise logon ko rokane ke liye yah faisla kiya gaya he
 According to railway officials, by the time the note was declared closed on the 8th, PRS bookings for express trains over the counter had been closed
 8 taarikh ko tikat kii kul booking 109
 5 crores, PRS booking was Rs 45 crores
 9 taarikh ko note bandi ke tahat railway puraane note le rahaa tha is vajah se tamaam jagahon par logon ne asi van, asi tu or asi 3 main hajaaron tikat book karaae is vajah se 9 taarikh ko railway ne kul 126
 67 in this ticket booking of 8 crores
 4 crores rupee kii tikat piares ke jariye book karai gai thi
 That is, people were booking indiscriminate tickets by giving 500 and 1000 notes at the ticket counter
 yah tikat booking kii ummid main karai ja rahi thi ki jab tikat cancil karai jaaegi to railway puraane noton kii jagah book karaane vaale ko karaare karaare nae note degaa isse logon ko yah ummid bandhi ki chalo kaale dhan kaa kuch hissaa to safed ho jayega
 But on 10th, when such news started reaching the top railway officials, they took a decision in a hurry
 vah faisla yah tha ki jo log bhi 14 november tak ₹1 xxrep 4 0 se zyada kii tikat book karaayenge to aise logon ko railway nakad rifund nahin degi balki is tarah kaa paisa sambandhit vyakti ke acount main transfar kiya jayega
 When this decision was taken, it was evening
 Look at the booking on the 10th, then 126 on the 10th
 2 karod rupee kii tikat booking karai gai or isamen se piares ke jariye karai gai booking 59
 55 crores
 yani ek din pehle ke mukaable faisle kii vajah se kami ai
 The decision to give the amount of cancellation of tickets of more than ₹ 10,000 to the account of the person concerned brought color on the 11th, on this day, when the honorarium of the people expected to turn their black money white through railways, there was no way to see it If they have reduced the booking, ticket booking amounting to Rs 110 crore was made on 11th, in which only 45 booking at PRS counter
 9 karod rupee kii rahi
 That is, a direct drop of about 25 percent compared to booking 1 day ago
 iskaa sidhaa sa matlab yah hua ki railway ke faisle ne logon kii galatfahami jald hi dur kar di or railway ke tikat ke jariye apane kaale dhan ko safed banane kii firaaq main lage log hataash ho gaye
 Talk of 12th date Torelway ticket booking was only Rs 98 crore, in which booking at PRS counters fell to Rs 37 crore
 13 taarikh ko railway kii tikat booking 79 karod rupee kii rahi or piares counter par booking ghatakar sirf 23 karod rupee kii rah gai
 Speaking of the 14th, the total ticket booking on this day was Rs 106 crore, of which PRS ticket booking was Rs 44 crore
 kul milakar yah kaha ja saktaa he railway ke tikat booking counter ke jariye apane paise ko safed banane kii jugat karne vaale log ab yahaan par nahin aa rahe hai
 In these situations, the railways have reduced the gas refund limit in ticket cancellation from 10,000 to ₹ 5000, which will surely give a big shock to those who want to make their money white by getting tickets from the railway
 ranvir singh kaa kahana he ki kariyar ke shuruaati daur main hi safalataa kaa swaad chakh lene ke kaaran unhen staradam mila, lekin unke parivaar ne unhen jameen se jode rakhane main madad kii
 Ranveer started his acting career with the 2010 hit film Band Baaja Baaraat
 iske baad unhone ‘ladies varsej riki bahal’ kii
 The 28-year-old actor's recently released film 'lootera' has also been well liked
 ranvir jab bhi kabhi ‘kharaab’ vyavhaar karne kii koshish karte hai, to unke pita unhen daant dete hai
 Ranveer said, 'everyone in my small family is closely related to each other
 mere parivaar ke log, khaskar mere pita, mere saath puri tarah spashtvaadi hai
 i would say that there have been occasions when my father has scolded me and said, 'what are you doing? Why are you behaving like this? You are really becoming a bad man
 ’is tarah ve mujhapar niyantran rakhte hai
 Ranveer said, 'and then i have two friends from the age of 13-14
 ve thik vaise hi hai, jaise sachche dost hote hai
 They also criticize my work and never let me fly in the air
 ve mujhe kisi aam ladke kii tarah hi mahasoos karavaate hai
 When you have such close people, your mind can never be disturbed
 ’ranvir singh kaa kahana he ki ve staradam ke bare main chintaa nahin karte or is industry main lambey samay ke liye tike rahanaa chaahate hai
 Ranveer says that he wants to be a part of meaningful cinema like Aamir Khan
 unhone kaha, ‘main aamir khan kii tarah mahatvapurn cinema kaa hissaa bananaa chahta hum
 i think he has been a part of the films that determine Indian cinema the most
 yahi meraa lakshya he

 According to Variety magazine, Luxan Sukameli will direct the film and along with him Kamlesh Pandey will screen the film
 film ke casting kii jaankaree bhi jaldi hi saajha kii jaaegi
 Apart from Osho, the film will also have other main characters
 kya osho rajnish se dar gai thi america sarkaar?film main us mahila patrkaar ke bare main bhi bataaya jayega jisane apni jaan jokhim main daal kar osho kii sachai jaanane ke liye jaanch-padtaal kii thi
 She was curious to know if Osho was really a genius or a fraud
 film main bharat kii aazaadee ke baad kii kahani ke bare main baat kii jaaegi
 The title of the film has been kept as Osho: Lord of the Full Moon
 osho ko rajnish or bhagwaan shri rajnish ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa tha
 Osho, who had read one and a half lakh books, chose this only book in Hindi
 In his time, Osho had gained popularity by speaking against revolutionary ideas, society's modalities and customs and due to this he was also surrounded by controversies
 
 osho aaj bhi kaaphi lokapriy hai or unke folovers desh hi nahin balki vishvabhar main faile hue hai

 The question of whether there will be enough electricity to run a business in India is as legitimate as whether there will be enough fuel for the transportation system or whether the work of generating and distributing electricity within the country is sustainable
 pehle sawaal kaa taarkik jawaab dene ke liye yah maan lenaa jaruri he ki bijli ke utpaadan, transmishan or vitaran kaa puraa kaarobaar kisi bhi anya aarthik gatividhi kii tarah hi samaan niyamon par chalaaya janaa chahie
 For this it is also necessary that our political leadership should not interfere in this entire business on any front other than fixing state-funded subsidies for the weaker sections
 is jagah ko javabdeh niamak pranali se bharaa ja saktaa he
 The common people and industries are now fed up with power cuts and rising prices, but we do not have enough electricity to meet the additional 25 per cent demand generated by climate change
 iske alaava takreeban sabhi bijli niamak ikaiyaan keemton main samay rahete santulan saadhane main naakaam rahi hai jiske chalate vitaran companiyon par baari karj kaa boj lad chukaa he
 7 in May 2012 electricity supply nationwide
 5 pha sadi se 11
 There has been a decrease of 2 percent
 kya hamaare paas aane vaale varshon main is kami ko puraa karne kii kshamta he? beshak, yadi ham ise rashtriya praathamikta kii suchi main pramukhataa den
 If we can raise the capacity addition level from 22,000 MW in the Tenth Plan to 6,000 MW in the 11th Plan, then surely we will be able to achieve the target of 80,000 MW in the 12th Plan
 aisa sambhav bhi he, kyonki hamane 2011-12 main kareeb 20,000 megawatt atirikt bijli paidaa kii thi or 2012-13 main bhi itani hi paidaa kar sakate hai
 In addition, 22,000 MW of power can be added per year in the subsequent two years, even if all of them are fully coal-fired thermal power plants
 philhal, ek lakh megawatt se zyada kii pariyojnaayen nirmaanadhin hai
 Since a thermal project takes four to six years to be operationalized, it will not come in the way of preparation for the 11th Plan
 philhal hamaari kul maujuuda kshamta 2,05,000 megawatt he jo adhiktar koyale se aati he or hamane 1,20,000 megawatt kii adhiktam dainik maang ko puraa kiya he
 The 18th Electric Power Survey shows that the maximum demand will be 2 lakh MW in 2016-17, assuming a GDP growth rate of nine per cent in the 12th Plan
 lihaaja, kshamta kii kami hamaari samasya nahin he, balki asal samasya eendhan kii uplabdhta kii he
 Most disbursing companies are having low cash reserves due to the huge difference between cost of supply and average earnings
 yah antar 2009-10 main biki bijli par prati unit 0
 73 Rs
 tha
 We have four solutions: The first is fuel
 koyale kii jarurat 2016-17 main 84
 20 million tons
 saamaanya kaarobaari sthitiyon main kol india kaa utpaadan 41
 50 million tonnes will be added, adding to it domestic and other sources, total availability 60
 4 karod ton kii banati he yani 23
 There will still be a shortage of 80 million tonnes of fuel
 is kami ko behatar lekin manhage koyale ke aayaat se hi puraa karnaa padegaa
 Coal India extent to extent 46
 1 karod ton paidaa kar saktaa he
 Us 18
 2 karod ton koyala aayaat karnaa hoga
 Secondly, we have to make arrangements for such power stations and tariffs which can work in times of maximum demand
 jin sthanon par lod zyada ho, vahaan ke liye storage hydro stesan or gas aadhaarit peking kendron kii sthapana kii jaani hogi
 For this, separate high tariff will have to be kept on the days of maximum demand so that the needs of consumers can be met
 upabhoktaaon ko smart meter tantra ke madhyam se is prakriya main bhagidaar banaaya janaa hoga
 The third solution may be that we have to improve efficiency so that consumption at the consumer level is reduced, especially in industries and agriculture
 jalwaayu parivartan par pradhanmantri kii kaaryayojna ke tahat pat (parform, achiv and trade) yojana desh ke bheetar 478 urja atisaksham audyogic ikaayiyon ko anivaary maanati he jahaan upbhog kam hota ho
 These consumers consumed 35% of India's total commercial energy consumption in 2009-10, which is 16
 6 karod ton tel ke baraabar (emtioi) baithta he
 Under the scheme, their energy consumption by 2014-15 6
 6 emtioi kam kiya janaa anivaary he jisase salanaa 7,000 karod ru
 Will save isse kam lakshya hasil karne vaali ikaayiyon ko dand bhugatna hoga
 The fourth and most important solution is to curb the revenue shortfall of distribution companies whose cumulative losses are two lakh crores
 ke kareeb pahunch rahaa he or laghu aavadhik ri na bhi kareeb itane hi hai
 These are essentially government institutions
 sarkari bijli niamakon ko vitarakon ke liye universal sarvice obligeshan ko badhyakaari bananaa hoga taaki choubees ghante bijli rahe
 In addition, prepaid meters will have to be installed for chaotic consumers in areas such as telecom
 yadi ham chaahate hai ki bagaiyr katautee ke hamaare gharon main roshni bani rahe, to hamen uski keemat bhi chukaani hogi

 inase avaidh vasuuli karnaa, jabaran kaid rakhana, pramaan patr chin kar rakh lenaa, jabaran sharaab pilaanaa, maansik rup se pratadit karnaa

 dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh swati maliwal ne kaha,“enjio lav commando ke khilaaf milane vaali shikayaton par ayog bahut chakit he
 The owner of the NGO took undue advantage of the fame he received from the TV program Satyamev Jayate and resorted to fulfilling his ulterior motives
 swati maliwal ne kaha ki yuva jodon kii sahaayta karne ke naam par usne avaidh vasuuli kaa ek dhandha khol liya tha
 i hope that the Delhi Police will investigate the matter thoroughly and stern action will be taken against the owner of the NGO and its associates

 mangalvaar ko aam aadmi party ne sansad maarg par march nikaala or notebandi kaa virodh kiya, lekin jitne naare or bhaashan aam aadmi party ke manch se hue, jantar mantar par usase kahin zyada bhaashan alag-alag sansthaaon ke manch par hue or naaron kaa josh in manchon par bhi kam nahin tha

 Let me tell you that on February 27, 2002, 59 people died in a fire in Gujarat's fire on February 27, 2002
 ye sabhi 'karsevak' the, jo ayodhya se laut rahe the

 sabarmati train ke S-6 coach ke andar bheeshan aag lagi thi
 Due to which the passengers present in the coach were hit by it
 inamen se zyaadaatar wo karsevak the, jo ram mandir andolan ke tahat ayodhya main ek kaarykram se laut rahe the
 59 karsevaks were killed by scorching fire
 jisane is ghatana ko bada raajnneetik rup de diya or gujarat ke maathe par ek amit daag laga diya tha
 Modi had called a meeting when the incident happened, Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 us vakt is ghatana ko ek sajeesh ke taur par dekha gaya tha
 After the incident, Modi called a meeting in the evening
 baithak ko lekar tamaam sawaal uthe
 There were allegations that there was a 'reaction to action' in the meeting
 godhra cond ko mana tha sajishtrain kii aag ko sajeesh mana gaya tha
 The Nanavati Commission probing the Godhra carnage had also admitted that the train was set on fire by the crowd
 magar, godhra cond ke agle hi din maamla ashaant ho gaya tha
 On 28 February, the bodies of karsevaks were brought from Godhra to Ahmedabad in an open truck
 ye ghatana bhi charchaa kaa vishay bani thi
 These bodies were entrusted to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad instead of family members
 jaldi hi godhra train kii is ghatana negujarat main dangonka rup le liya tha

 patidaar andolan se netaa bane hardik patel ko rajdroh sahit tamaam maamalon main hai court se jamaanat milane ke baad gujarat kii raajnneeti garma gai he
 While the Congress is engaged to woo the Patidars who are angry with the BJP, the BJP is convincing the Patidars that Hardik has been granted bail due to the soft attitude of the Anandiben government
 hardik se pehle jail se baahar aayaa uskaa khatahardik patel ne jail se khat likhakar kaha he ki jab tak patidaaron ko nyaay nahin miltaa he, unki ye ladai jari rahegi
 After the sedition case of Ahmedabad and Surat after the bail of Hardik Patel in the Visnagar violence, it has now been decided that he will soon be out of jail
 hardik ke saath kaam karne vaale patidaar samaaj ke logon kaa kahana he ki vah 15 july ko subah jail se bahaar aayega
 Hardik said that his letter came out on Tuesday before release
 jail main rahakar or majboot hue iradegel se likhe khat main hardik ne likhaa he ki mujhe bhartiya samvidhan par puraa bharosa he
 Won after a long time
 nau maheenaa maa ke garbh main rahane jitna vakt jail main rahakar bahut kuch seekhney ke liye mila he
 i am not a criminal
 jail main rahakar mere iraade or majboot ban gaye
 Hardik Hardik has never met Amit Shah, he has been teaching how to clean political dirt in 9 months in jail
 main kabhi bijepi adhyaksh amit shah yaa unke kisi netaa yaa congress ke kisi netaa se nahin mila
 It is not a movement of any political party
 yah kisi party kaa andolan hota to main kab kaa baahar hota
 Hardik's direct message to BJP and Congress is clear that before the release of Hardik's jail, an attempt has been made to give a direct message to the Anandiben government of BJP and the Congress which wants to take political advantage of him and the Patidars
 hardik patel ke saathi varun patel kaa kahana he ki jamaanat dilaane mensarkaar kaa koi narm rukh nahintha
 The government's counsel had given a very strong argument
 ise jajment kii copy se saaf dekha ja saktaa he
 Patidars' strategy in the 2017 assembly elections What will be the strategy of Hardik Patel after Hardik comes out of jail? How strong will the Patidars' reservation movement be? Gujarat High Court has asked to stay outside Gujarat for 6 months
 us dauraan wo kahaan jaaenge, yah sawaal bana hua he
 Patidars influence on 50 seats in the state, now one year is left in the 2017 Gujarat Assembly elections
 gujarat main patidaar 17 fisadi hai or patidaar vot saurashtra, uttar gujarat, dakshin gujarat samet kareeb 50 siton par haaavee rahete hai
 If the agitation intensifies after Hardik Patel comes out of jail, the BJP may have to bear the brunt of the Patidars' displeasure
 bijepi-congress main credit kii rassakashibijepi baar-baar yahi raag alaap rahi he ki hardik ko jail se chhudaane main sarkaar kii ahm bhoomika he
 Gujarat Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi says that the Patidars who put the BJP in power put the Patidars in jail
 jail se baahar aane par hoga bada kaarykrampatidaaron ne hardik ke jail ke bahaar aane ke baad pura program tay kar liya he
 Hardik will welcome him when the Patidars come out of jail
 iske baad surat main ek badi sabha kii jaaegi
 The permission was granted to visit the village for a day
 Hardik had asked the court for permission to visit his Kuldevi, but the court has banned him from visiting Mahesana for 9 months
 vaise main hardik ke khaas aagrah par court ne use apana saamaan lene ke liye khud ke ghar viramgaanv aane kii ijaajat di he
 Kul Devi will go to see Hardik in the police guard; Hardik will be left in the state where he would like to go
 patidaaron kii maane to hardik pehle apni kuladevi ke mandir khodldham jaaenge phir sanragpur hanuman kaa darshan kar apane ghar jaaenge
 After this they will have to leave Gujarat
 upi, dilli yaa rajasthan ja sakate hai hardikphilhalapatidaar aarakshan andolan samitike pravaktaa varun patel kaa kahana he ki hardik dilli, rajasthan yaa upi ke lakhanu ja sakate hai
 July 20 is the birthday of Hardik Patel
 vaise main janmdin se pehle hardik 15 taarikh ko jail se baahar aa rahaa he
 The effect of the government's strategy will be seen: How effective the government's strategy of keeping Hardik out of Gujarat will prove to be for the Patidar reservation movement
 lekin itnaa jarur he ki hardik ke jail se reeha hone par patidaar andolan ko ek baar phir hawa milegi

 bhushan ne kaha ki rafel vimaanon kii kharid ke liye do sarkaron ke bich koi qaraar nahin he kyonki france sarkaar ne 58,000 karod rupe ke is saude main bharat ko koi samprabhu guarantee nahin di he

 There is no reason to doubt

 Whenever it seems that terror is going to be relieved
 tab-tab ek or aisi khabar aa jaati he, jo raahat ke bajaae, dehshat paidaa kar jaati he
 The world had just realized that the end of ISIS was near and then ISIS played its last bet
 daanv bhi aisa kii ek jatke main uski takat doguni ho gai
 The news is that Baghdadi has formed an alliance
 apane hi jaise khoonkhaar aatanki sanghathan al-kaayda se
 Now what will be the result of this alliance
 abhi iskaa andaaza laga paanaa bhi mushkil he
 ISIS also had handshakes with Al Qaeda
 ranjishein bhi thi
 There was also enmity
 magar aatank kii duniya kaa dastur kahata he ki gar saamne musiibat ho, to ek duusare se haath mila lenaa chahie
 There is good in that ye iraq or syria ke maujuuda halaat se paidaa hui aatankwaadiyon kii isi noummidi main bhi ummid dhughane kii aakhri koshish kii gai he
 Which ISIS has done with shaking hands with its biggest enemy in the world of terror
 apni ujaad sultanate ko bachaane ke liye bagdadi ne jawahiri
 
 aurajwahiri ne bagdadiki taraf haath badhaayaa he
 
 aatanki kii dosti kaa haath
 
 taaki naam baaki rahe
 
 iesas kaa bhi or alqaida kaa bhi
 
 varanaa jo halaat iraq or syria main ban chuke hai
 
 usamen akele rahakar na to bagdadi kii khayr he
 
 or na hi alqaida ke nusra front kii
 
 ji nusra front
 
 isi naam se alqaida syria main vidrohi banakar asad sarkaar se lard rahaa he
 The Vice President of Iraq Revealed This terror alliance has not been disclosed by any agency but by Iraqi Vice President Ayad Alvi
 zaahir he in daavon main kuch to sanjidagi hogi hi he
 And if so, at least this is not good news for those who are living in their clutches in Iraq and Syria
 ham ye to nahin kah sakate ki kab se magar itnaa tay he ki donon aatanki sanghathanon main baatcheet jari he
 The mediators of Baghdadi and Jawahiri are talking about an alliance among themselves
 khatm nahin hoga iesas kaa aatankise main bina kisi road map
 It will be difficult to control the situation after the war of support and political intervention
 jaisaa ki ham jaanate hai ki agar iraq se iesas ko khatm bhi kar liya jaae to bhi wo marane vaala nahin he
 These wars are going to be prolonged because ISIS has now spread all over the world
 hamaare paas puri jaankaree he ki donon aatanki sanghathan milakar ladane kii planning kar rahe hai
 So even after their elimination from here, their slipper cells will be present in the whole world
 aatankiyon ke paas bachane kaa ek hi tareekairaq main iesas ke tazaa halaat ye hai ki iraqi-america phujon, kurdish fiteron or shiya milicia ne kareeb kareeb inkaa kaam tamaam kar diya he
 And now these traces are left only to a few villages in Mosul
 vahiin rus ke saath milakar syrian phujon ne bhi takreeban takreeban yahi haal apane desh main alqaida kaa bhi kar diya he
 In such a situation, now both of them have the only way left
 apni jaan bachaane kaa bhi or apana naam bachaane kaa bhi
 Both the terrorist organizations came together to realize the danger, but from the point of view, till 2003, ISIS was al-qaidaki branch
 magar saddaam ke takhta palat ke baad khud ko khalipha ghoshit karne or apana alag sanghathan banane kii sanak main bagdadi ne iesas banaaya
 And because of his impunity, this organization of Baghdadi managed to create panic all over the world along with Iraq and Syria
