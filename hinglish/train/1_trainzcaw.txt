 The much-talked-about T20 World Cup cricket between India and Pakistan will now take place in Kolkata rather than Dharamshala due to security reasons and with this announcement, the speculation regarding this match has come to an end
 pakistan ke suraksha dal ke muyne ke baad isisi ne yah match kolkata ke eden garden ko sthanantarit karne kaa elaan kiya
 ICC Chief Executive Dave Richardson said in a press conference, "the decision to have India and Pakistan match in Kolkata instead of Dharamshala was taken for security reasons

 After the Himachal Pradesh government expressed its inability to protect the match, there were uncertainties over the match
 bisisiai sachiv anuraag thakur ne kaha tha ki rajya ko raajnneeti nahin kerani chaiye
 Richardson said he had no choice but to hold the match elsewhere
 unhone kaha, ‘‘faisla kaaphi soch vichaar ke baad liya gaya he
 The ICC and BCCI are aware of the disappointment with this decision but the safety of the tournament is paramount and we took into consideration the concerns raised by our security advisor and the Pakistan Cricket Board
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘main yah pushti karnaa chahta hum ki isisi ko sabhi rajya prashasan ne aashwast kiya he ki suraksha ke puure upaay kiye jaayenge taaki toornament surakshit maahaul main ho sake

 India is a big and complicated country and every ICC tournament faces a lot of challenges

 bainkon main lambii kataron or bheed ko niyantrit karne ke liye sarkaar ne ek nai pahal kii he
 Now people who come to exchange money will have the mark of ink like voting ink so that those who are in the queue can be stopped again and again
 bainkon or atm ke saamne lagi lambii kataron main kuch aise log bhi hai jo sandigdh tareeke se kaale dhan ko safed karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Shaktikanta Das, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, claimed this on Tuesday

 Like voting, this ink will be applied on the fingers of the money changers

 The government claims that there are people in these lines who are standing up to replace old notes several times a day

 "comments vitt mantralay ke paas jaankaree ai he ki garibon, kisaanon ke jan-dhan khaaton main kaaphi paisa apratyaashit tareeke se jamaa hua he
 Now an appeal has been made to the public account holders not to let it be misused
 shaktikant das kehete hai, "kuch jan-dhan khaaton par vishesh nazar rakh rahe hai
 Their limit is Rs 50,000 while the amount up to 49000 has been deposited
 '' The government has also decided to set up a special task force to monitor attempts to use fake currency in the banking system in some areas which will investigate the attempt to deposit black money
 ab bainkon ke sakht niyamon ko lagu karne ke dauraan ye sunishchit karnaa hoga ki aam jaruratmand logon kii pareshaani or naa bade
 There are also some people in long queues in front of banks and atms who are trying to white out black money suspiciously
 aarthik maamalon ke vibhaag ke sachiv shaktikant das ne mangalvaar ko ye daawa kiya
 Now to clamp down on such people, the finance ministry has instructed banks to use special ink
 voting kii hi tarah ye syaahi paisa badalane waalon kii anguliyon par lagaai jaaegi
 Because of this, it will not be possible to change the note more than once
 sarkaar kaa daawa he ki in linon main aise log bhi hai jo din main kai baar puraane note badalane ke liye khadey ho rahe hai
 Shaktikanta Das said, "in the first phase, the system of ink installation has been directed to be implemented in big cities
 "tippaniyan The finance ministry has come to know that a lot of money has been deposited in the Jan Dhan accounts of the poor and farmers

 The death of Namvar Singh is tragic despite his mature age and long literature practice because he has come at a time in which the democratic place of criticism is being reduced to a planned manner in almost every field
 ve lagbhag saat dashak tak aalochana likhte-bolte-padhaate-sikhaate rahe
 It is a tragic irony that the criticism that he had unshakable faith and that he was a fearless user, there is a constant conspiracy to suppress the same criticism in the last phase of his life and exclude him from social discourse
 karne vaale ve hai jo swayan aalochana or asahmati kaa prayog kar hi loktantric vyavastha main sattarudh hue hai
 Namvar Singh may not have gone against these powers in the way he expected, but he was restless due to this fate of criticism
 namvar singh aalochana ko rachana kaa pichhalgua na maanate the, na hi unki aalochana aisi pichhalgua rahi he
 He was one of the few critics who considered criticism to be a companion of the composition, with full confidence and humility
 vidwata, adhyayan, anusandhan, rasikata, vichaar aadi sabhi ko namvar ji ne asaadhaaran pratibha or kshamta ke saath saadhaa
 But basically he was a critic
 agar hindi sahitya ko ek tarah kaa bahultamulak loktantr mana jaae to namvar singh usamen barason pratipaksh kii bhoomika nibhaate-nibhaate sattarudh ho gaye
 No critic found such centrality, prestige and popularity in Hindi as that of Namvar ji
 shaayad kisi bhartiya bhashaa main aalochak ke varchasv kaa aisa or udhaaharan nahin he
 Ramchandra Shukla, Hazari Prasad Dwivedi, Ramvilas Sharma may have been older than Namvar ji and Vijaydev Narayan Sahi as his counterpart, but none of them have gained the kind of place and influence that came from his criticism
 aise saahitiyik paridrishy main jahaan rachana hi centre main rahati ai he, aalochana kaa centre main aana, bina rachana ko apdasth kiye, or ek tarah kii bahukendrikta bananaa ek apratyaashit ghatana he
 Namwar Ji had a special request on the sociality of literature and the need of literature to society
 ve sahitya ko saamaajik sanstha maanate the
 They had disagreements about it many times but they had the amazing ability to relate the changes in literature to socio-political changes
 ve hindi samaaj ko baar-baar yah jataate rahe ki parivartan samajhane or unase nipatane ke liye sahitya kii darkaar hoti he
 Namwar Singh, a longtime teacher, also played the role of a teacher in his time and society: to the extent that he wrote less, spoke more
 unki vagmita saarvajanik vaktrutv kaa ek pratimaan banakar ubhari
 Many times, many people would have listened to them more than they would have read carefully
 yah tak kaha ja saktaa he ki hamaare samay or samaaj main unhone aalochana kii ek saarvajanik vaachik parampara shuru or pratishthit kii
 He was a rare public intellectual of Hindi
 namvar ji apane samay ke bahupathit vyakti the or unki ruchi or paith sahitya ke alaava parampara, itihaas, samskruti, darshan, vichaar, marxvad, aadhuniktaa or uttar aadhuniktaa aadi main gahari thi
 But this huge and deep scholar never allowed Namvar ji to be a burden on his writing or on himself and others
 ve apratyaashit dhang se kisi samakaleen kriti yaa vritti ko praakrit ke kisi pad se yaa walter benjamin ke kisi vaktavy se jodakar samajha sakate the
 There is no other person in Hindi who can instill intellectual gossip with elders, middlemen, moderns and post-moderns with such ease and confidence
 apane ko marxvaadi vichaardhaara kaa ek yoddha maanane vaale namvar singh ne kattarta se dhara main bahna hameshaa pasand nahin kiya
 Like a vigilant critic, he was distracted by it every time he took the risk of being accused of opportunism
 unki gahari rasik-ruchi or drushti main jab-tab dwandv hote rahe or ve kai baar apni ruchi ke bajaae apni drushti se paksh main jhuk jate the
 But there is no doubt that his book-eyed eyes were rarely found to fail in honest examination
 yah bhi ullekhneey he ki namvar ji ne hindi aalochana kii bhashaa ko academik duruhata se mukt kar sampreshnty banane kii lagaataar cheshtaa kii
 He himself never put the burden of his scholarship on her while she was deep and authentic
 hindi adhyaaapak ke rup main namvar singh ek pratimaan ban gaeh un jaise prabhaavshaalee or vicharottejak shikshak kam hi hue hai
 The Vimana Namvar Ji weaved of rapture, wisdom and compassion used to impress and overwhelm his students
 unhone vishvavidhyalay str ke hindi paathyakram ko adhik praasangik banane main bhi mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 Many of his students are teaching across the country today and some of their succession will be left in them, such can be expected
 namvar singh kii yuva peedi main, kai baar ataarkik lagati, aasthaa thi or uske kaaran ve kai baar yuva kritiyon or lekhakon ke bare main atishyokti karne main koi sankoch nahin karte the
 If the moral duty of the critic is to read to the latest till the end, then no one else could have performed this duty better than Namvar ji
 namvar ji ke dehavsaan se hindi main aalochana or aalochak ke varchasv kaa yug samaapt hota haih shaayad murdhanyata kaa bhi
 Now we will go back to the average again
 *** Russia's expert team has made suggestions after preliminary study to fulfill India's dream of running a train at a speed of 200 kmph on a 571-km rail line between Nagpur and Secunderabad
 rus ne hai speed karidor banane ke liye is rail line kii 2 meter oonchi fensing karne kii salaah di he
 There is also a need to cover the land under the railway line with a 40 cm thick concrete sheet
 is tarah ke tamaam sujhaavon ke saath rus ke takneekee pratinidhimandal ne rajdhani dilli main rail bhawan ke andar rail board ke aalaa afasaron ko apane praarambhik adhyayan se rubaru karaayaa
 The delegation from Russia put their plans in front of the railway
 apane prajentation main roosi visheshgyon ne kaha kii nagpur or sikanderabad ke bich purirelway linemein amulchul parivartan kii jarurat he
 To run this railway line at a speed of 200 kilometers per hour, many things need to be changed
 uske mutabik aarambhik adhyayan main yah pataa chalaa he ki yahaan par sanchaar takanic ko bhi letest banaae jane kii jarurat he
 Apart from this, it is necessary to modernize the traction line on this line as per the requirement
 tej raftaar main rail line ke neeche kii jameen naa khiske iske liye bhi kai jagahon par yah jaruri he kii patari ke neeche kii mitti badali jaae
 There are many railway bridges between nagpur-secunderabad and along with this there are small culverts at the place, the Russian delegation said the need for a detailed study to test the strength of all these
 gauratlab he ki pichley saal 15 oktober ko bharat ke puraane mitra desh rus ne bhartiya railway ko raftaar badhaane main madad dene kaa bharosa diya he
 In this case, between the two countries, it has been agreed to study to increase the speed of trains in Nagpur Secunderabad Railway Corridor
 Under this protocol, plans to increase the speed of trains between nagpur-secunderabad to 200 kmph
 is
 rus is maamle main bharat ko takneekee salaah degaa saath hi saath nagpur or sikanderabad ke bich hispid karidor main rus kii railway bhartiya railway ke saath milakar fifty-fifty bhagidaari par sahamat bani thi
 Russia will also help India financially for this
 rus ne bharat ko disambar 2015 ke dauraan takneekee sahyog dene kaa vaayada kiya tha iske liye donon deshon ke bich emoyu sin hua tha
 Several areas of mutual cooperation were identified in the mou, Russia promised to cooperate in high-speed rail in India
 isi ke sathrelonki gati 107 se 200 kilometre prati ghante tak badhaane ke liye bhartiya railway kii maujuuda linon kaa aadhunikeekaran kaa bhi vaayada kiya gaya tha rus ne satellite nevigation or digital sanchaar madhyamon par aadhaarit aadhunik niyantran evam suraksha sambandhit pranaaliyon ke maamle main bhartiya railway kaa puraa sahyog dene ko kaha tha
 Apart from this, technical cooperation was also agreed between India and Russia on rolling stock
the two countries had talked about transportation security and cyber security as well as redevelopment of stations
 duniya kii sabase lambii rail line trans siberian railway chalaane kaa anubhav rus ko he
 The Trans Siberian Railway passes through places which are wild and difficult geographically, in such a situation, this railway is considered to be the wonder of the world, Russia has all the technical information which it can share with the Indian Railways
 isse jahaan ek taraf bhartiya railway ko sasti keemat par takanic mil paaegi to vahiin duusari taraf bharat ke mitra desh rus ko ek bada bazaar
 In this way, this cooperation will be a profitable deal for both the countries
 global reating agency fich retings kaa kahana he ki bharat main guds and services tex (jiesti) lagu karnaa utpaadakta (productivity) main sahyog karegaa or arthvyavastha main iskaa phayda lambii avadhi ke baad dekhne ko milegaa
 According to Fitch, the possibility of long-term growth from GST will increase but tax revenue is unlikely to increase in the near future
 ek karadhaan vyavastha kaa sutarapaat karne walastiek july ko lagu kiya gaya, usamen chaar stareey kar he
 However, revenue will get boosted indirectly in the long run as it supports GDP growth and promotes tax compliance
 apane pratidwandi mudies ke vipareet fich desh kii vittiya saakh par is nayi kar vyavastha ke prabhaav par chup he
 It is worth mentioning that Moody's had said last Sunday that the new tax system will accelerate GDP and this step will prove positive for India's financial credibility
 fich ke mutabikasti kaa laabhyah he ki khudara kaarobaariyon ko rifund kaa daawa karne ke liye aapurt shrinkhalaa main anupaalan dikhaanaa hoga
 Larger companies will encourage their smaller suppliers to push for tax compliance
 kendra sarkaar ne 1 july se puure desh main jiesti lagu karne kaa faisla liya he
 Along with the government, many economic experts at the global level claim that this step will see an improvement in India's credit rating, while foreign investors will also see an increase in the trend towards India
 gauratlab he ki credit reating agencia duniyabar ke deshon kii aarthik or raajnneetik sthit ke aadhaar par use credit reating detii hai
 Global investors are prepared to invest in a country based on this rating
 2017 ke aankadon ke mutabik maujuuda samay main badi arthvyavasthaaon or achche nivesh thikaanon kii suchi main bharat kii sthiti yah chart bayaan karti he
 At the same time, the police said that lathi-charge had to be lathi-charged since RJD workers got down on the scuffle with the police and started stone-pelting
 vahiin rajbhavan ke sutron kaa kahana he ki nirdhaarit samay par koi bhi rajd kaa netaa rajbhavan nahin aayaa
 But of course RJD is trying to maintain the issue of creation scam even if CBI is under investigation
 party ke netaa maanate hai ki is vishay par aise bhi party bijepi jaise vipaksh main aakraamak rahati thi vaisaa tevar dikhne main kaamyaab nahin rahi he
 One of the major reasons for this is that both RJD President Lalu Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav are camping in Delhi due to inquiries in cases against them
 samaajawaadee party ke adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ke chachaa or pragatisheel samaajawaadee party (lohia) (pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (lohia)) ke chif shivpal yadav ne kaha ki uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party (samajwadi Party) or bahujan samaaj party (bahujan Samaj Party) kaa gathbandhan unke bina adhuraa he
 He said that only the Secular Front can defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party in the elections
 aapako bataa den ki shanivaar ko uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party (sapa) or bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ne gathbandhan kiya
 During this time, the two parties reached an agreement on seat sharing in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 donon partiyon ne uttar pradesh kii 80 loksabhaa siton main se 38-38 siton par chunaav ladane kaa faisla liya
 Apart from this, 4 seats have been left including Amethi and Rae Bareli seats
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki do siten purv kendriya mantri ajit singh kii party rashtriya lok dal (rashtriya Lok Dal) ke liye chodi gai hai
 Along with Congress, Shivpal Yadav's Progressive Samajwadi Party (lohia) is also excluded from this alliance
 shanivaar ko jab shivpal yadav se sapa-basapa gathbandhan ko lekar sawaal kiye gaye, to unhone kaha ki yah gathbandhan pragatisheel samaajawaadee party ke bina adhuraa he
 Only the Secular Front can defeat the BJP in elections
 agar ham pichley loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav kii baat karen, to donon main hi sapa or basapa ko karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP had won 71 seats out of 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh and Apna Dal, bjp's ally in NDA, won 2 seats
 aapako bataa den ki haal hi main shivpal yadav samaajawaadee party se alag hokar pragatisheel samaajawaadee party (lohia) banaai thi
 After this, he also announced the creation of a secular front to defeat the BJP in the state
 mayawati ne press conference ke dauraan shivpal par lee thi chutkishukravaar ko bahujan samaaj party or samaajawaadee party ke bich gathbandhan ke elaan ke dauraan mayawati ne pragatisheel samaajawaadee party (lohia) chif shivpal yadav par chutki lee, jis par akhilesh yadav bhi apni hansee roak paae
 Referring to Shivpal Yadav, Mayawati had said, "fearing our alliance, the Bharatiya Janata Party is dragging Akhilesh Yadav's name into the mining scam and misusing the Central Investigation Agency (CBI)

 ' Pawar saheb is missing the sacrifice of Sonia Gandhi nowadays
 vahi qurbaani, jis mudde par pavaar kabhi congress se alag hue the
 But now NCP President Sharad Pawar feels that Sonia has made a historical sacrifice by rejecting the post of Prime Minister and the decision to oppose her was probably not right
 kehete hai raajnneeti main koi bhi baat puraani nahin hoti
 At least Sonia Gandhi's rejection of the Prime Minister's post is a matter of Indian politics, which the Congress would never want to let go
 lekin ab to wo log hi sonia kii is siyaasi qurbaani ko yaad karne se gurej nahin karte jo kabhi sonia ke mudde par hi congress se alag hue the
 You already know Sharad Pawar
 or ye bhi jaanate hi honge ki unhone ensipi kyon banaai thi
 But today, when he turns the old pages of politics, the honey-filled words for Sonia itself are dripping
 ensipi adhyaksh sharad pavaar ne kaha, 'wo vivaad hamane hi khadaa kiya tha
 But one thing i must admit is that we had raised the issue of the post of Prime Minister
 lekin hamen baad main samaj main aayaa ki itnaa bada pradhanmantri kaa pad unhen mil rahaa tha lekin unhone sweekaar nahin kiya, ye sonia ji kaa badppan he
 'such are the equations of power
 jab virodh main rahen to jamkar virodh karen or jab haath mil jaae to dosti to nibhaani hi padegi
 Pawar's changing tone and speech with the needles of the clock at least indicates this

 Another Bollywood actor has broken the silence over the ongoing controversy over Pakistani artists working in India
 ji haa, ham baat kar rahe hai damdaar acting or khaas dialog delivery ke liye mashhoor actor naanaa patekar kii
 Recently, when Nana Patekar was asked a question on the ban imposed in the Pakistani artists 'perfumed industry, his answer was something like,' For me Pakistani artists and everyone else comes later, the first is my country
 desh ke alaava main kisi ko bhi nahin jaanata or na hi jaananaa chaahunga
 Artists are like bedbugs in front of the country
 'itnaa hi nahin, ishaaron hi ishaaron mennana patekarne salmaan khan ke us bayaan par bhi tanj ksaa jisamen unhone pakistani kalakaaron kaa saport kiya tha
 Let me tell you that Salman Khan said in support of Pakistani artists that he is not a terrorist, he comes to the country only when the government gives him a visa
 sarhad pardesh kii surakshake liye khadey javaanon ko desh kaa asli hero bataate hue naanaa ne kaha ki ham actor maamuli log hai
 There cannot be a hero greater than the soldiers
 ham jo bolte hai us par dhyaan mat do
 There is no place for artists in front of the soldiers of the country, so there is no need to give such importance

 India's star batsman Virat Kohli has recently suffered the brunt of deciding not to play in the three-match series against Bangladesh

 De Villiers also tops the list of Test batsmen while Kohli is at 10th position
 haalanki agle kuch maheenon main ranking main badlaav aa saktaa he kyonki divilliars ko srilanka jabaki kohli ne england main khelnaa he
 Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma have also suffered losses like Kohli due to taking rest from Bangladesh tour
 dhawan do sthaan ke nuksaan se 10wein jabaki rohit sheersh 20 se baahar hokar 23wein sthaan par hai
 Suresh Raina, who captained India in Bangladesh, moved up two places to 27th position
 vanade gendbaajon kii suchi main ravindra jadeja or ravichandran aswin ko do-do sthaan kaa nuksaan hua he
 Both of them are seventh and 12th respectively
 tej gendbaaj umesh yadav aath sthaan ke phaayde se 78wein paaydaan par hai
 Stuart Binny, who took six wickets for four runs in the second ODI against Bangladesh, is ranked 206 with a jump of 23 places
 jadeja vanade oleroundaron kii suchi main chauthaa sthaan barkaraar hai
 Pakistan's Mohammad Hafeez tops the list of all-rounders

 a lot of sweets are being sold on Diwali, but there is no poison in them
 ji haa, aisi khabar soshal media par viral ho rahi he, jisamen daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki desh main bikne vaala 67
 7% milk is adulterated
 iske peeche tark diya ja rahaa he ki desh main doodh kaa utpaadan 14 karod or khapat 64 karod litre he to kya ham or aap doodh ke naam par jehar pi rahe hai?kya aap jaharila doodh pi rahe hai? jise aap doodh samaj rahe hai kahin vah jehar to nahin he? bina gaay-bhens ke desh main bah rahi hai doodh kii nadiyaan? ye sawaal ham yun hi nahin uthaa rahe hai
 This is behind this viral video and news which is going viral on many social media platforms including whatsapp
 is video ke jariye daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki desh main jitna bhi doodh bik rahaa he, usamen zyaadaatar nakli he
 It is not milk, but poison
 is viral khabar kii hedline main likhaa he ki doodh nahin jehar peetaa he india
 While it has been claimed in the viral news that whatever milk is being sold in the country, it is mostly fake
 wo doodh nahin he, balki jehar he
 It is written in the headline of this viral news that India drinks poison, not milk
 viral khabar main daawa kiya gaya he ki desh main doodh kaa utpaadan 14 karod litre he, lekin khapat 64 karod litre he
 It is being claimed that 68 sold in the country
 7 fisadi doodh or usase bana product milavati he
 It does not meet the standards set by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India
 dablyuechao ne chetavanee di he ki agar milawat band nahin hui to 87 fisadi bharatiyon ko 2025 tak cancer ho saktaa he
 This news was shocking for us about the poisoning of milk
 is khabar ke viral hone kaa mauka to dekhie
 There is a festive atmosphere in the country, it is Diwali, at this time people celebrate happiness by distributing sweets to each other on a large scale
 aise main hamaare liye ye jaananaa jaruri tha ki mithai jahrili to nahin he?hamane is viral khabar kii padtaal karne kii thaanee
 The viral news claimed that this information was given by Mohan Singh Ahluwalia, Member, Animal Welfare Board India
 hamane sabase pehle mohan singh ahaluwalia ko se sampark kiya
 Talked to him about this viral news
 ahaluwalia ne is baat par achraj jataayaa ki desh main doodh se itane bade paimaane par aisi chijen kaise ban rahi hai jabaki itani maatra main doodh hota hi nahin he
 Ahluwalia made it clear that poisonous milk is being traded in the country under the connivance of government agencies and the mafia conspiracy
 lekin sarkaar is par sakhti karegi, varanaa aane vaale samay main logon ko cancer jaisi bhayanak bimaariyaan jhelni pad sakati hai
 He is going everywhere and exposing the business of poisonous milk
 unhone daawa kiya ki desh main bikne vaala 68
 7% of milk and products made from it are adulterated or poisonous
 science and technology ministry ne bhi food sefti and standard athurity of india 2011 ke survey ke aankade ke hawaale se parliament main isaki pushti kii thi
 As we were progressing in the viral test of fake and poisonous milk, shocking information was coming one after the other
 isi padtaal main hamaari mulaakaat hui swami achyutanand se, jinhone nakli doodh kii ladaai supreme court main ladi
 He said that in 2016, the Supreme Court had ordered all state governments to set up mobile labs, hasty fines in cases of fake milk
 is padtaal main hamaare haath food sefti and standard athurity of india (FSSAI) kii website par sanyukt nideshak dayaa shankar kii ek adwijuri haath lagi
 In this, he has clearly written that adulteration cases often increase during the festival season when demand for milk and milk products is out of supply
 is chitthee main doodh main kya kya milaayaa jaataa he, iskaa bhi zikr kiya gaya he
 Milk mafia add water to increase the milk content
 iske alaava uria, schimd milk powder kaa bhi istemaal hota he
 Detergent powder, soap, synthetic milk are also used to make fake milk
 doodh main fat dikhaane ke liye vegetable oil or fat kaa istemaal hota he
 Hypochlorides, chloramines, hydrogen paraoxide, boric acid are used to prevent milk from bursting
 dahi, paneer, makkhan or kriim banane main bhi hanikaarak rasayanon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 With regard to how harmful this fake milk made of all the chemicals is for health, we have learned from senior nutritionist Dr
 manjari chandra se baat kii
 He said that it is harmful if the chemical content in milk is high
 agar roj is tarah se chemical vaale doodh pite hai to bacchon main neuro, mental ilnes, vikaas kii kami or cancer jaisi beemaari bhi ho sakati he
 Our investigation was now complete
 padtaal main is viral khabar kaa daawa pukhta mila

 teen talaak ko jurm ghoshit kar uske liye sajaa mukarrar karne vaala bill aaj rajyasabha main pesh ho gaya
 However, the opposition's demand to send him to the Select Committee and the Government's refusal to such an uproar that the Deputy Speaker adjourned the House for the whole day
 ab donon paksh ek-duusare kii manshaa par sawaal uthaa rahe hai or apane paksh ko lekar safai de rahe hai
 The triple talaq bill introduced in the Rajya Sabha was passed by almost unanimous vote in the Lok Sabha on Friday
 mahaj paanch ghante kii bahes or bina kisi sanshodhan ke is bill ko bijepi or congress sahit sabhi dalon ne jyon kaa tyon paas kar diya
 The bill requires that it should also be passed by the Rajya Sabha so that it can be made law after the President's signature
 rajyasabha main aaj kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne bill ko pesh kiya lekin vipaksh ne lagbhag ek swar main ise sthaayee samiti ke paas bhejne kii maang kar daali
 The government which was on the backfoot due to the opposition's stance, the government was surprised to send this bill of the opposition including the Congress to the Select Committee
 sarkaar kaa tark tha ki congress sahit jin partiyon ne loksabhaa main bina dikkat ke bill ko paas kara diya ve rajyasabha main badale stand ke saath kaise aa sakati hai
 On the other hand, the opposition argued that the House has a process of its own and that it is following it
 bill ko select cameti main bhejne kii maang jaij or jaruri he
 Jaitley gave 6 months of argument On behalf of the government, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley opposed sending the bill to the Select Committee and said that when the Supreme Court had declared the triple talaq as illegal, then it had asked to make a law within six months
 wo chah maheene 22 farvari ko puure ho rahe hai isliye sadan ko tatkaal bill ko paas karana chahie
 On the other hand, Congress leader Anand Sharma said that there is time for 22 February
 bajet satr isi maheene ke ant main shuru ho jayega tab tak bill par select cameti vichaar kare or ise or majboot kanoon kii shakl de taaki bill kii khaamiyon ko dur kiya ja sake
 Congress leader Kapil Sibal said that when the court had given six months time, it also said that these months will be completed when the law is made
 is tarah sarkaar vakt kaa bahaanaa banaakar jaldbaaji nahin kar sakati
 Amendments put up by the opposition, the Chair said - After the bill was introduced in the legitimate Rajya Sabha, two amendments were introduced by the opposition
 jetali ne ye kahkar in sanshodhano kaa virodh kiya ki congress parampara kaa paalan nahin kar rahi he or sanshodhan ke liye 24 ghante pehle soochna deni hoti he lekin tikhi bahes ke baad upasabhapati pi je courian ne is sanshodhano ko vaid mana
 After this, the opposition members started demanding voting on these amendments, but some members started creating ruckus on behalf of the ruling party
 isapar chair ne sadan kii kaarywahi puure din ke liye sthagit kar di
 Congress strategy: After the proceedings of the Congress, Ranjit Ranjan said on behalf of the Congress that this is a conspiracy
 bijepi karnataka chunaav tak tripal talaak kaa mudda jivit rakhana chaahati he
 The opposition was demanding a division but the government was adamant on postponing the Rajya Sabha

 Shiv Sena, an ally of the government, was also against it

 The government did not allow voting to take place in fear
 congress ne aisa kar muslimon ke bich ye sandesh pahunchane kii koshish kii he ki usne unke hiton ko lekar ladanaa band nahin kiya he
 bjp's strategy: The government does not want to show itself in a minority on triple talaq in any way
 agar voting hoti or sanshodhan manjuur ho jate to uski kirakiri hoti kyonki uske sahyogi hi bill ke khilaaf the
 In such a situation, he chose the way of not voting
 bijepi ab sadan ke baahar teen talaak par vipaksh khaskar congress par hamalavar rahegi ki usne teen talaak kaa bill paas nahin hone diya or muslim mahilaon kii jagah muslim kattarpathiyon kaa paksh sadan main majboot kiya

 After the assassination of Hindu Samaj Party President Kamlesh Tiwari, CM Yogi Adityanath met the victim's family
 unhone kamalesh tiwari ke parijanon ko milane ke liye lakhanu bulaayaa
 After the meeting with CM, Kamlesh Tiwari's mother said that she does not expect much from CM Yogi and his administration
 hamen unke haav-bhav se aisa hi laga 
 This statement of Kamlesh Tiwari's mother, Dr
 kumaar vishwaas ne samarthan kiya he
 He made a tweet after his statement in which Kumar wrote that even if the poor system kills your family, you will have to go to the court of the self-styled owners of that system! After the death of Sanatan rites, the family cannot leave the house till the thirteenth, but the person who dies, whether the law-keeper is an inspector of Bulandshahr or a victim of fundamentalists, will read the court
 nikammi vyavastha aapke gharavaalon ko maar bhi de tab bhi us vyavastha ke swayambhu maalikon ke darbar main janaa hi hoga ! sanathan sanskaron main mrityu ke baad terahavin tak parijan ghar nahin chhod sakate par maranevaala chaahe kaanoon kaa rakhwala bulandshahr kaa inspactor ho yaa kattarpathiyon kaa shikaar,janaa padhegaa darbar https: / / t
 co / 6zoylcrede Explain that after meeting CM Yogi, Kamlesh Tiwari's mother expressed dissatisfaction over this meeting
 aadhikarik sutron ne bataaya tha ki mukhyamantri ne apane awaas par kamalesh tiwari kii maa kusuma, patni kiran or parivaar ke kuch anya sadasyon se mulaakaat kii
 During this, he assured full assistance to the victim's family and said that the government is investigating this serious matter in depth and those guilty will not be spared at all
 haalanki, tiwari kii maa kusuma ne is mulaakaat par asantosh jataate hue kaha tha ki police ke dabaav kii vajah se unhen majabuuran mukhyamantri se milane janaa padaa
 He also said that the Chief Minister's gestures during the meeting were not as per his expectation
 samvaadadaataaon ke is sawaal par kii kya vah mukhyamantri se hui mulaakaat se santusht hai, kusuma ne kaha tha ki santusht kya honge? hamane (mukhyamantri se) poocha ki kyon (kamalesh kii) suraksha hataai gai, kyon uskaa berahami se katl hua
 In Hinduism (after someone dies in the house), 13 days is not taken out anywhere, but their (chief Minister) order was there, so the policemen were after me, then we had to go for help
 ' unhone kaha tha ki hamaari ichha ke mutabik na to unka (mukhyamantri) haav tha na bhav
 If satisfied, why would our anger boil over? We will raise the sword ourselves, if we do not get justice
 'bataa den ki kusuma ne bhaajapa ke ek sthaneey netaa shiv kumaar gupta par jameen ke vivaad ko lekar apane bete kii hatya kaa iljaam lagaaya he, magar abhi uske khilaaf koi karrwai nahin hui he
 On the other hand, after meeting with the Chief Minister, Tiwari's wife Kiran told that Yogi has assured all possible action
 ham unase hui mulaakaat se santusht hai
 Meanwhile, Samajwadi Party (SP) President Akhilesh Yadav said on the meeting of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath with the family of Hindu Samaj Party leader Kamlesh Tiwari, who was killed in the capital Lucknow on Friday, said that it is expected that Yogi will share similar empathy in other districts Will also show towards the family of those killed

 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi guuruuvaar ko punjab ke fatehgarh sahib main kisaan surajeet singh ke ghar gaye
 Surjeet Singh met Rahul Gandhi on April 28 at the grain market in Sirhind and told the farmers about the situation, but a month later, he committed suicide on June 10 after being fed up with debt
 abhi zyaada din nahin beete jab is kisaan ne apni birdari kaa haal purazor tareeke se congress upaadhyaksh ke saamne rakhaa tha
 His pictures made newspaper headlines, but neither was any compensation for the wasted crops nor the confidence of loan pardon
 mritak kisaan ke bete kulwinder singh ne bataaya ki sarkaar kaa koi mantri nahin aayaa or na hi koi afasar, wo to nagar kirthan nikaal rahe hai, kisaan kii sud lene ke liye unke paas time nahin he
 Surjeet's family is sorry that no government representative came to ask about his condition
 vaise badal sarkaar ke paas in dinon fursat he bhi nahin
 The entire staff is preparing for the celebration on the 350th birth anniversary of the establishment of Anandpur Sahib
 19 june ko bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah bhi is kaarykram main shirkat karenge
 Crores of rupees have been spent on the program
 akali dal kii nazar 2017 main vidhansabha chunaav par he
 At the Mahila Akali Dal's conference in Anandpur Sahib on Wednesday, Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal made his intentions clear
 unhone kaha ki rajya main satta hasil kiye bagaiyr dharm kii raksha nahin kii ja sakati he
 Due to unseasonal rains in Punjab, crops in about 7 lakh acres were damaged
 badal sarkaar ne centre se 10 hazaar rupee prati acre muaavze kii maang kii thi, modi sarkaar ne sahaayta raashi to badha di, lekin kisaanon ko kuch nahin mila
 The comments fatehgarh sahib se congressi vidhayak kulajit singh nagara ne kaha ki badal sarkaar ne apni taraf se 3 hazaar rupee muawza raashi kaa elaan kiya tha, lekin kisi ko nahin mila
 Earlier, the government used to give Rs 2 lakh to the family of the farmer who committed suicide, now he has also stopped

 Not many days have passed when this farmer had presented his community in a very strong manner to the Congress Vice President
 unki tasviren akhbaaron kii surkhiyaan baniin, lekin barbaad fasalon kaa na to koi muawza mila or na hi qarz maafi kaa bharosa
 Kulwinder Singh, the son of the deceased farmer told that no government minister nor any officer, he is taking out the city kirtan, he has no time to take care of the farmer
 surajeet ke parivaar ko malaal he ki sarkaar kaa koi numaayinda unka haal poochne nahin aayaa
 By the way, Badal government does not have free time these days

 The Badal government had demanded compensation of Rs 10,000 per acre from the Center, the Modi government increased the amount of aid, but the farmers did not get anything
 tippaniyan Congress MLA from Fatehgarh Sahib Kuljit Singh Nagra said that the Badal government had announced a compensation of Rs 3,000 for his side, but none were found

 aaj bandanavaaz secularadaas kaa phone aayaa-jaldi milo
 He never called directly in this way
 unka assistant karata tha or kuch intazaar ke baad hi ve line par aate the
 i appeared in front of them, avoiding sharp steps
 ve krodh or chintaa se post hue ja rahe the
 The issue was - conversion of people from Agra to Muslims back to Hindu
 bole,'tum kehete ho dharmantaran ahindu he, phir yah sab kyon!?main pasopesh main tha kya kahuun? yahaan vichaardhaara se zyada secularadaas kii haalat mahatvapurn thi
 So i said: None, if you are brought up by the caste of Hindus, then you will become a Muslim again
 is par ve bifer gaye- are musalamaanon main bhi jaatpant kam nahin
 i do not think they will become Muslims back
 ab kya kiya jaae
 Seculardas was in front of me with his hands in his hands, and i was helpless to say anything
 tabhi ek idia aayaa-chaachu, agle chunaav main congress kii vaapasi hogi
 Then these people will again convert to Islam
 yah sunate hi unki ankhen chhalchala gayi
 He started saying - Look, you are lying on lies to keep my mind
 congress vah plane he jiskaa payalat pappu he or modyandhi ke kaaran raajnneetik mausam ekadam pratikul he
 This fly away, will not be able to take takeoff
 main bhi kahaan himmat haaranevaala tha
 So the temptation to use the last weapon could not stop - 'you' will gradually replace the Congress
 derasber secular- vampanthi bhi yahaan theha lagane aa jaaenge
 May be his government is formed in Delhi again
 aapako kya pareshaani?secularadaas is baar gambhir ho gaye
 He said that you are like a lover who got so much love and trust of the girlfriend that he went to Narbhasia and without reason came down on such a thing
 jab hosh aayaa to premika thi, uskaa prem bhi tha lekin vishwaas phakta ho chukaa tha
 What do you mean? i asked being suspicious
 bade sadhe andaaj main secularadaas ne bolnaa shuru kiya-bhai awwal to 'aap' kii sarkaar banane se rahi
 Even if it is made, then this time it will be immersed in the service of the Amokhas so that no one will have time for secular-communal and hindu-muslim
 'tab to badi acchhee baat hogi', maine tokate hue joda
 He then said - See what you will understand us
 humlog secular-communal ke rath par savaar ho naukari paae
 The people of this party got close to power
 bina kisi kaam- dham ke apana sikaa jam gaya
 But meanwhile, internet-mobile-anna-aap and Modi came and spoiled the work
 ye sab kaam karwaane vaale hai or hamaari kaam kii aadat nahin rahi
 i was listening to them with my face ve bina ruke bolte rahe- ham to secular-communal or hindu-muslim ke sahare ritair hone kaa sapana dekh rahe the
 What we do not know is that India or any country becomes good or bad because of its majority
 aaj jo bhi acha he usamen hinduon kaa role bada he
 Kashmir is Muslim-majority
 kya haal ho gaya vahaan kaa? pakistan ke andruni kalah kaa niryaat kendra ban kar rah gaya he
 Suddenly, his attention turned to the clock
 raat ke nau baj rahe the
 He said - Today i cannot even ask you to stop
 donon kamred yahaan jimne vaale hai
 Somebody had brought two bottles of Konyak from America
 or haa, ho sake kabhi kabhaar aa janaa
 Your lie is more comforting than your actual public tent
 maine chutki lee- mujhe kisi ne yahaan dekh liya to? bandanavaaz secularadaas is baar adharoshthon main muskaraaye- are, koi nahin
 i was following Lenin's line: one step back, two steps forward

 26 percent and Muslim voters can play a decisive role in 125 of the total 403 seats in the state assembly
 muslim matadaata aamtaur par bhaajapa ko naapsand karne vaale maane jate hai lekin musalamaanon ke vot bantane kaa sabase zyada phayda bhi bhaajapa ko hi hota he
 This is because the parties that identify themselves as secular depend to a large extent on Muslim voters to take an edge over each other, while the BJP has its traditional vote bank
 varsh 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main sapa kii abhootpurv jeet ke liye muslim matadaataaon ke uske paksh main samuhik matdaan ko mukhya kaaran mana gaya tha
 SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav had also accepted this from several public forums
 muslim matadaataaon ko lubhaane ke liye basapa mukhiya mayawati sabase zyada sakriy najar aa rahi hai
 He said on Saturday that his party can defeat the BJP if the Muslims support it

 According to political observers, in the politics of Uttar Pradesh, which is usually controlled by ethnicity, Muslims are mainly considered as the traditional vote bank of the SP, but in their manifesto released for the 2012 assembly elections, the promises made to the Muslims are not implemented
 And recently there has been signs of disenchantment of Muslim voters with this party due to the ruckus in the 'socialist family'

 He has said that if this match-like situation comes again, he will once again give the 19th over to Rubel Hussain
 rubell ne 19wein over main 22 ran kharch kiye the or yaheen se match bangladesh ke haath se nikalnaa shuru ho gaya tha
 India's wicket-keeper-batsman Dinesh Karthik took the match from Bangladesh's eight-ball innings in this match, winning the victory from Bangladesh's mouth

 com / kvqqiulqkn — twdownload (@twdownload) March 18, 2018 When Karthik came to bat, India's score was 133 for five at the end of 18 overs
 bharat ko jeet ke liye aakhri do overon main 34 ranon kii darkaar thi or karthik ne aate hi rubell dwaara phenke gaye 19wein over main do shandaar chhakkon kii madad se 22 ran batore or aakhri over kii aakhri gend par chakka maar bangladesh ko khitaabi jeet se maharoom rakh diya
 Karthik's winning six on the last ball, Miandad's 32-year-old spell faded Fasashakib said that Rubel bowled according to strategy, but Karthik's batting was different
 daily star ne shaakib ke hawaale se likhaa he, 'eemaandaaree se kahuun to unhone ranneeti ke baahar ja kar kuch bhi nahin kiya
 i don't know that there are batsmen who can hit a six as soon as they come and a four and then a six on the next ball
 'shaakib ne kaha, 'is tarah kii ballebaaji itihaas main kam hui hai, vah chamatkaarik ballebaaji thi, lekin karthik ne aisa kiya
 Obviously Rubel was nervous after giving 10 runs on the first two balls

 purvi dilli main bhukh se hui teen bacchiyon kii maut ne phir ek baar desh ko dahala diya he
 In the same manner as in Jharkhand, the country was stirred by the death of Santoshi in 2017, the death of Santoshi 11 years in 2017 and the death of 58 years Savitri Devi in june this year
 lekin aisi hi kai or mautein hai jinka zikr tak nahin hua
 Similar is the case of the Musahar colony of Kusabanaraski, where seven deaths occurred in the same family, but they did not mention anything other than the local newspapers
 During the Lok Sabha election coverage, some people of the Mushars colony in village Mehndiganj in Sevapuri assembly seat of Banaras, April 2014 Was told this, 'she is looking at the house in front, last year only the whole family died of hunger here
 chaar bachche, maa-baap or ek boodha
 For me, the news of 'death from hunger' was shocking
 kya 2014 main bhukh se maut kii khabar saamaanya khabar ho sakati he? kaala handi main pade aakaal ke baad yah shaayad pehla mauka tha jab bhukh se maut kii khabar maine suni thi
 However, this news could not be confirmed
 anganbari se lekar bidio tak dm se lekar jile ke vidhayak tak sabase poochtacha kii lekin kisi ne yah nahin kubula ki in saat mauton kii vajah bhukh thi
 Ainum said so much, there was definitely 'malnutrition' among the children, but it was not at this stage that they would die
 yah jawaab bhukh kii ore ishaara kar rahaa tha
 But this does not technically prove to be a 'death by hunger'
 basti ke logon ne bataaya ki maa-baap, donon eent ke bhatthon main mazdooree karte the
 But both were ill for a long time
 isliye kamai kaa jariya parivaar ke paas nahin tha
 The people of the township helped for many days, but how long did anyone help? No one knew exactly what day the death took place
 is basti ke kuch gharon main rashan card nahin tha or jin gharon main tha unhen cotedaar kabhi rashan detaa tha or kabhi nahin
 Allegedly, the family of whom the people of the township reported about starvation did not have ration cards
 basti ke logon ne bataaya is haadase ke baad pehali baar yahaan bade-bade adhikariyon kaa jamaavada laga tha
 There were barely 20–22 houses in the settlement
 us basti main 2014 april tak na to sadak bani thi or na hi bijli pahunchi thi
 People from the township told, "ainum and Asha come here only occasionally
" is basti kii kismat kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki ek taraf bilkul satee hui muslim basti or ek taraf brahmanon kii basti thi
 Both the settlements had roads as well as electricity
 lekin yah basti sarkari sevaaon se dur thi
 Inquired as far as could be inquired
 jab koi suraag nahin mila to yah khabar bich main hi chhot gai
 This news was also published in local newspapers as the death of seven people
 kisi ne bhi in mauton kii padtaal gaharaai se nahin kii
 i remember this incident in the Mushars colony for the first time in September 2017 in Simdega, Jharkhand, when the 11-year-old girl died of hunger
 phir jharkhand giridih jile ke mangargaddi gaanv main isi saal hui 58 varshiya savitri devi kii bhukh se hui maut ke vakt ai
 And i cursed myself many times that after all, why did i not go into that news in depth? The reason was probably to meet my election coverage target
 khayr ab ham us khabar kaa zikr karte hai jisko lekar local se lekar neshnal media tak khub ho-hallaa kataa
 Regarding the death of Savitri Devi in jharkhand, the villagers said that their ration card was canceled due to lack of link with Aadhaar
 uske baad se unhen rashan nahin mil rahaa tha
 But the administration explained the disease behind this death and proved it
 santoshi kii maut kii vajah bhi aadhaar card kaa rashan card se na link hona thi
 Santoshi's family was also not getting ration
 uski maa ne kai jarnliston ko bataaya ki kaise uski bacchee kii maut 'bhaat-bhaat' kehete hue ho gai
 The reality is that non-governmental organizations, the opposition or the media only wake up when the news can create a ruckus or a sensation between the ruling party and the opposition
 agar aadhaar ko jaruri karne kaa virodh na karnaa hota to jharkhand main bhukh se hui mautein bhi saamne nahin aatin
 This issue too might have been lost without investigation like the death of Musars of Benares
 purvi dilli main hui teen bacchiyon kii maut kaa mudda bada banane ke chance hai kyonki pehali baat yah mudda rajdhani kaa he duusari baat satta paksh se jis tarah se ise ghar-ghar rashan pahunchane kii yojana se joda gaya usase lagata he, bacchiyon kii maut par abhi or hangaamaa hoga
 Although Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia first tried to shake off, saying that the children had eaten food a day earlier, then how could starvation die? But later the facts in the medical report had to be accepted
 udhar 'aap' ke pravaktaa saurabh bharadwaj ne mudde ko lapakate hue ise alji banaam kejariwal vivaad se jod diya
 He hinted in the matter itself that it would not have happened if there was a plan to provide ration to the house
 or is yojana kaa virodh to sabko pataa he alji sahab kar rahe the
 bjp's Manoj Tiwari and Congress's Ajay Maken also linked it to the hue and cry of the government
 yani rajya badla he par siyasat kaa charitra nahin
 From the state of Jharkhand to Delhi, there is exactly one kind of politics on hunger deaths
 system phir ho gaya felkailash satyaarthee children foundation kii nideshak jyoti maathur kahati hai, ''har jile yahaan tak ki block or gaanv ke str par bal suraksha samitiyaan hoti hai
 The job of these committees is to map the children of the area
 unki suraksha se jude har pahaluon par najar rakhana
 Overall, the work of these committees is to educate and educate children about health
 yah cameti integrated child protection skim (isipies) ke tahat kaam karti he
 "the scheme runs with the participation of the government and civil society
" ve yah bhi bataati hai ki teen bacchiyon kii maut child protection system kii asafalataa ko darshata he
 That means here the system failed again
 in samitiyon ke alaava sawaal yah bhi uthta he ki us kshetra kii anganbari kahaan hai?dilli sarkaar kii annapurna yojana or shila dikshit ke samay shuru hui apni rasoi yojana kahaan hai?duniya ke banisbat kitna bhookha bharat ?ab yah bhi dekh len ki duniya main 'bhukh' ko lekar hamaari sthiti kya he? global hangar index 2017 ke anusaar 119 deshon main bharat kaa number 100 he
 The rank was 97 in 2016
 yani ek saal main ham teen rank neeche phisal gaye
 In this case we are around countries like Djibouti and Rwanda
 report ke anusaar paanch saal se kam umr ke har teen main se ek bachche kaa vajan saamaanya se kam he, vah undervet he
 That is 37
 5 fisadi bachche saamaanya se kam vajan vaale hai
 One in three children is of short stature
 yani 38
 4 percent of children are lower than normal children
 21 pratishat bachche krushkaay yani behad kamjor hai
 All these figures show malnutrition and its type
 pakistan or afghanistan kii rank hamase kuch kharaab he lekin nepal, srilanka, bangladesh kii rank hamase kahin zyada acchhee he
 Nepal's rank is 72, Sri Lanka's rank is 84 and Bangladesh's rank is 88
 jabaki pakistan kii rank 106 or afghanistan kii 107 he
 The starvation of someone is not the country's poverty, but the system's failure
 isliye aisi mauton kii padtaal karte vakt satta paksh or vipaksh ke bayanon ke chhapane se jyaad jaruri hota he system kii padtaal kar us uski khaamiyon ko khojna
 *** jharkhand ke gumla jile main pipul liberation front of india (pielefai) ke teen sandigdh kaaryakartaaon kii shuukravaar ko logon dwaara peet-peet kar hatya kar di gayi

 'captain amarinder soniyaji ko dhamka sake he, virbhadra dhamka sakate hai, apana faisla kara sakate hai, tab hooda saab kyon naa kar sakate hai'
 The speech came from the dais of former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh and his son Deepender Singh Hooda

 Hooda now wants to strengthen the farmer movement in Haryana against the central and state government
 saath hi iske jariye wo apni siyaasi taaqat dikhaakar alaakaman par dabaav daalkar pradesh kii kaman chaahate hai
 On one hand, Rahul Gandhi is trying to revolve the farmer movement by moving around the country
 unhone sabhi pradesh adhyakshon ko taakid kii he ki, wo apane pradeshon main kisaan andolan kii jaankaree har str par len or kisaanon ke saath khadey hon
 That is why Haryana Congress President Ashok Tanwar is holding meetings on the issue of farmers at the district level and is preparing a future strategy
 kisaanon kii 5 panchayaton main alag alag hissaa lengevahin duusari taraf hooda iske samanaantar baithken kar rahe hai or apana kaarykram bana rahe hai
 Hooda says that he will take a separate share in 5 panchayats of farmers in Haryana

 After this, at the district level, the farmers will organize a village padyatra by gathering
 hoodaka kahana he ki, centre kii haryana or centre sarkaar ne kisaanon ke saath vaadakhilaphi kii he
 Aaj Tak asked Hooda that, do you agree with the speech Ranjit Singh is giving from your platform? On this, Hooda said, what should i do if someone says something from the forum, i am a disciplined soldier of Congress
 vahiin manch se bhaashan dene vaale choudhary ranjit singh se ajtak ne band daravaaje main manch se die bhaashan kaa zikr kiya to unhone apana bhaashan doharaa diya, haa dhamkaane jaisaa shabd ab wo bolne se bachate rahe, lekin punjab ke captain or himachal ke virbhadra kaa udhaaharan hooda ko dena nahin bhuule
 On the whole, it is well known that Hooda once again wants the command of Hariyanangakress
 isse pehle rahul kii reliyon main bhi hooda samarthak or tanvar samarthak aapas main bhid chuke hai
 Hooda does not miss a chance to show his strength on every occasion

 These shooters from Uttar Pradesh are named Chandro and Prakashi Tomar

 Anurag Kashyap says that he was very excited when he heard this story
 anuraag kashyap aparaadh kii prishthbhumi par filmein banane ke liye mashhoor hai
 He has formed Gangs of Wasseypur, Gulal, Next etc

 Recently, he said that he was jealous of some films
 kashyap ne twit kiya tha, "meri suchi ek jailis film nirmaataa kii he, kyonki inamen se kuch yaa sabhi ne mujhe phir se sochane par majaboor kar diya, mujhe saahas diya, mujhe abhibhoot kar diya or maine khud se poocha, 'maine kyon ise is tarah se nahin dekha'

 After this, Badhi Ho's name was Likha, in which Neena Gupta and Ayushman Khurana acted tremendously

 dakshin asia ke saat deshon ke pramukhon ne shuukravaar ko bharat kii ore se apane padosiyon ko 450 karod rupee ke sanchaar upgrah ke rup main die gaye uphaar kii sarvasammati se saraahna kii to in deshon ke bich ek abhootpurv antarikshawya sambandh kii baangi dekhne ko mili
 There is no earlier example in the world of space where a free regional communication satellite was presented in this way
 yah bharat ke vishaal hriday ko dikhaata he
 The South Asia satellite, promoted as a project beloved by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is now in orbit
 jokhim bharaa lekin behad aasaan kaam ab puraa ho chukaa he or nishchit taur par isro ne ise anjaam diya he
 But the difficult task is now beginning, when seven member countries have to use their resources to build grassroots infrastructure and keep the software ready for satellite-sent information
 yah kaam kehane ko to aasaan he lekin ise karnaa kaaphi mushkil he
 The real purpose is to stop the influence of China
 After the successful launch of this satellite, Modi said in the video conference, today is a historic day for South Asia
 ek aisa din, jo pehle kabhi nahin aayaa
 Two years ago, India made a promise
 usne dakshin asia main apane bhaaiyon or bahanon ke vikaas or samruddhi ke liye aadhunik antarikshawya praudyogiki ke vistaar kaa vaada kiya tha
 He said, the successful launch of the South Asia satellite fulfills that promise
 is prakshepan ke saath hamane apni saajhedaari ke sabase agrim morche ko banane ke safar kii shuruyaat kar di he
 What was not said was that through this unprecedented foreign policy initiative, India is trying to limit China's growing influence in the region
 pakistan ne apane antarikshawya kaarykram kaa hawala dete hue khud ko is antariksh kaarykram se alag rakhaa
 While everyone knows that its program is far behind in India's state-of-the-art space capabilities and is in a nascent stage
 kaig laga chukaa he isro ko fatkaaris baat main koi andeh nahin he ki antariksh praudyogiki ke kshetra main bharat kii kshamtaayen ucch str kii hai lekin desh kii kai antarikshawya sampattiyon par hathi paalane vaali kahawat lagu hone lagi he
 In the past, the CAG had also reprimanded ISRO for not using photographs taken from space by the country's large remote sensing satellites? These pictures were kept locked and were not made available to civilian planners
 isamen se kaaphi kuch badla he lekin ab bhi jo ek meter se kam ke rejolution vaali upgrahi tasviren hai, ve nagarikon kii pahunch se baahar hai
 The 450-million-satellite satellite edusat launched in 2004, India's Rs 450-crore communications satellite - edusat also failed to meet its targets
 iskaa uddeshy sanvadatmak shikshan ke jariye un logon tak pahunchane kaa he, jahaan aam taur par pahunch nahin banaai ja paati
 The National Institute of Advanced Studies, Bangalore assessed EDUSAT and concluded that it was not fully utilized as it was a technology-based initiative, with inadequate focus on creating appropriate reading material
 vivaadit rahaa jisat-6 kaa prakshepanvarsh 2014 main isro ne behad vivaadit jisat-6 ko prakshepit kiya
 This satellite provides satellite-based unprecedented multimedia capabilities to India's military forces
 lekin khabaron kii maane to iske liye jo handset jaruri hai, ve abhi tak puri tarah viksit nahin hue hai
 It seems that ISRO employs a workforce of 16000 personnel as per its resolve but the ministry fails to make full use of those benefits
 dakshin asia upgrah ke parinaam kaa akalan abhi kar lenaa jaldbaaji hoga or iske liye hamen 12 saal intjaar karnaa hoga
 This is the minimum lifetime of this satellite
 dainik jivan main jab kisi ko koi mahangaa uphaar miltaa he, jiske rakrakhaav par lagaataar acha-khaasaa dhan kharch karne kii jarurat hoti he to vah akasar dhul hi phaankata he
 SAARC countries will have to spend millions of dollars
 We expect Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives and India to put together and put in several millions of dollars which would be necessary to achieve the benefits of this satellite
 bharat kii ore se mili is moolyawaan uphaar kaa purna istemaal na kar paane kii anya vajah ye bhi ho sakati hai ki bharat ke padosi deshon ke paas yaa to pehle se hi sanchaar upgrah hai yaa phir ve inhen hasil karne kii disha main kaam kar rahe hai
 Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani had said, "if we cannot cooperate on the ground, at least in the sky we can cooperate
" sutron kaa kahana he ki is desh ke saath samjhauta hona ab bhi baaki he
 For this they cite technical reasons
 afganistan ke paas pehle se hi afgansaveganistan ke paas pehle se hi afgansat naamak upgrah he
 It is a communications satellite, which he has leased from a European country
 ab yah dekhnaa hoga ki afgaan log dakshin asia upgrah kii sevaaon kaa istemaal karne kaa antim faisla kaise karte hai
 Nepal felt the need for a communication satellite during the horrific 2015 earthquake
 isliye disambar 2016 main usne ek nahin do sanchaar upgrah hasil karne ke liye nivida nikaali
 The government of Nepal can test the Satcom technology on India's gift but in the long run it will have to wait to see if it builds a structure similar to it
 bangladesh bhej saktaa he bangbandhu-1 upgrahabangladesh kii pradhanmantri shaikh hasina ne kaha, prakruti or uske praroopon ko jaanane kii disha main yah ek ahm kadam he
 On today's auspicious occasion, our people can be improved through fruitful relationships
 lekin isi ke saath dakshin asia upgrah kaa intjaar kiye bina hi bangladesh ne antariksh ke kshetra main apni kshamtaaon kaa vistaar shuru kar diya
 He is hopeful that by the end of this year, he can put his Bangabandhu-1 satellite into orbit
 reporton ke mutabik yah upgrah france kii company thels elenia spes dwaara banaaya ja rahaa he
 Sri Lanka already has a communications satellite called supremesat srilanka
 iskaa sanchaalan srilankai upgrah sanchaalak supremesat privet limited dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Interestingly, it is also partnered with China's Great Wall Industry Corporation, China's official satellite manufacturing institute
 ummid he ki 2230 kilogram kaa yah dakshin asia upgrah antariksh main ek mithravat upgrah rahegaa or yah antariksh main hathi paalane jaisaa sabit nahin hoga

 The audience enjoyed the Marvel movie Avengers Infinity War
 haalanki film kaa climex dekh kar bahut se darshak niraash bhi hue
 This is because most superheroes die at the end of the film
 film darshakon ko ek aisi sichuation main laakar chhod detii he jahaan aap sirf kayaas lagaate rah jate hai
 But it is being said that the Avengers will revive in the next part of the film and take revenge on Villain Thanoz
 Incredibles 2 kii elastigirl ke liye kaajol kaa wais over, videomarvala studios ke president kevin fies ne kaha tha ki film ke agle part ke naam kaa khulaasa abhi nahin hone ja rahaa he
 However, flying news about the title of this fourth film of the Avengers series has started coming
 kaha yah ja rahaa he ki maarval studio kii is 22veen film kaa naam "avengers: infinity gontlet" hoga
 It is being said that production is working on the film with this name
 harry potter ke actor mathew louis ne kii garlfriend se shadibataa den ki maarval filmon ke itihaas main avengers- infinity war pehali film thi jisamen villen jeet jaataa he
 However, this film leaves behind many questions in the end, whose answers we will probably get in the next part
 dekhnaa yah hoga ki avengers kaa doosraa part kab aata he or yah apane saath kya kuch thriller lekar aata he
 Describing herself as a greedy actress, Vidya Balan said that she is happy to play roles in 'dirty Picture' and 'kahaani' films
 in donon filmon ke bare main unka maananaa he ki in filmon ne bollywood main safal mahila kendrit filmon ko badhaava diya he
 The comments unhone kaha, haa, main ek laalchee abhinetri hum
 
 
 So i accepted these tremendous opportunities and those films ('dirty Picture' and 'kahaani') paved the way for (heroine-centric films)
 unhone kaha, mujhe iskaa (mahila kendrit filmein ab paisa kama rahi he) shrey lenaa pasand he
 
 
 i become very polite when someone says this
 lekin mer khyaal se sachai yah he ki cinema vaastaviktaa dikhaata he or hamaare aasapaas kii vaastaviktaa yah he ki zyaadaatar mahilaayein apni sharton par jivan ji rahi hai
 He said, yes, i am a greedy actress
 
 
 isliye maine in jabardast maukon ko sweekaar kar liya or un filmon ('darty pikchar' or 'kahani') ne (nayika kendrit bhoomika vaali filmon) ke liye kaamyaab rasta banaaya
 He said, i like to take credit for it (women-centric films are now making money)
 
 
 jab koi yah kahata he to main bahut vinamr ho jaati hum
 But the truth of my mind is that cinema shows reality and the reality around us is that most women are living life on their own terms
 unhone kaha, mujhe iskaa (mahila kendrit filmein ab paisa kama rahi he) shrey lenaa pasand he
 
 
 i become very polite when someone says this
 lekin mer khyaal se sachai yah he ki cinema vaastaviktaa dikhaata he or hamaare aasapaas kii vaastaviktaa yah he ki zyaadaatar mahilaayein apni sharton par jivan ji rahi hai

 In the previous hearing, the five-judge constitution bench had said that the matter should be postponed for the time being because the Center is seriously considering enacting a law to protect people's data in whatsapp, Facebook and other apps
 centre sarkaar yah bhi dekh rahi he ki kya aisa kanoon banaaya ja saktaa he jiske tahat sarvice daata company yaa ap ke data share karne par roak lagaai ja sake

 The work of the Bollywood industry is now becoming less visible on the screen in political news
 desh main ek ke baad ek filmon ke relies ko lekar khub raajnneeti ho rahi he
 Opponents have also opened up against the commercial films of Bollywood to films based on social issues
 pehle deepika padukon starer film padmavati or ab mujffarnagar dangon par besd film 'mujffarnagar : da burning lav' ke virodh main kuch log utar aae hai
 Know what is the whole matter: Princess Diya, angry at Padmavati, said- Rajasthan director has not tolerated tampering
 Actually director Harish Kumar has made the film 'muzaffarnagar: The Burning Love' on the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots
 ye film is saal 17 november ko relies honi he
 Even before release, some anti-social elements in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, have come out to oppose it
 nirdesh harish kumaar ne ek intervyuu main kaha he ki sampradayik dangon ke bure prabhaav ko unhone film main dikhaane kii himmat kii he
 The director has raised the question that when the censor board has passed the film after watching it then why is it being opposed? Election Commission refuses to ban Padmavati, BJP had demanded that it Filmmakers are the ones who dare to show the bad effects of communal riots
 
 It is art and it should be seen with this view
 sensor board ne film dekhi he or agar kuch galat hota to ve ise roak dete
 Who are these people who want to stop the release of the film? Then what is the meaning of having a censor board? There is no other option but to commit suicide Harish Kumar, hurt by the film's protest, quoted Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film 'padmavati' and said that the filmmakers were easily targeted Can go and have always been taken
 unhone kaha ki agar aisa hi hota rahaa to desh main film mekars ke liye bhi vahi halaat ho jaaenge jo ki aatmahatya karne vaale kisaan ke hote hai
 Harish said, 'A farmer is forced to commit suicide without rain and government assistance
 bilkul aisa hi film industry main filmkaaron ke saath ho rahaa he
 'EXCLUSIVE: Full story of Muzaffarnagar riots
 
 
 mujffarnagar main film kii relies ko laker aa rahi dikkaton ke bare main unhone kaha ki aisi atakalein hai ki kuch log film ko bain karaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 He said, the film's posters and standees were sent earlier, but the theater owners are hesitating
 haalanki, kisi ne khuleam in baton ko sweekaar nahin kiya he, lekin mujhe bataaya gaya he ki unhen meri film nahin dikhaane ke liye majaboor kiya ja rahaa he

 Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal said whether the rat will not go to jail if the minister is from the current government ombudsman
 main is lokapal bill par anna ke samarthan se dukhi hum, shaayad unhen puri baat nahin pataa he, kabhi miloongaa to bataaungaa
 The health of Anna ji is important for the country
 'kejariwal ne kaha, 'yah vidheyak kamjor he or isse bhrashtachar nahin rukegaa, balki yah bhrasht logon ko bachaane kaa kaam karegaa
 AAP member Prashant Bhushan said, 'this Lokpal Bill does not have a provision to constitute Lokayuktas, it does not have a provision to protect those who disclose, and it is not free from the government
 'prashanth bhushan ne kaha, 'yadi yah vidheyak bhrashtachar rokane main asamarth he to phir ise paarit karne kaa kya matlab he?' unhone kaha ki yah sirf bhrasht logon ko bachaayegaa
 AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal meanwhile said that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has not been given independence in this bill
 kejariwal ne kaha, 've is vidheyak main sibiai ko swatantra nahin kar rahe hai
 If the CBI becomes independent then the Prime Minister can also go to jail in 2G or some other scams
 'lokapal vidheyak loksabhaa main paarit ho chukaa he or rajyasabha kii pravar samiti ne usamen kaaphi sanshodhan kiye, or shuukravaar ko is vidheyak ko bahes ke liye rajyasabha main pesh kiya gaya
 After the bill is passed in the Rajya Sabha, it will be sent to the Lok Sabha for approval
 sarkaar ne kaha he ki vah vidheyak ko isi satr main paarit karne ke liye bachanabaddh he
 The winter session of Parliament ends on Friday
 anna kaa palatvaraam aadmi party par anna ne palatwaar kiya he
 He said that Kejriwal is speaking on the Lokpal bill without reading it
 mere andolan se ye bill aayaa he
 Aam Aadmi Party should agitate for the shortfall
 unhone kaha ye bill acha he isliye samarthan de rahaa hum, ye isi satr main paas hona chahie, adhiktar partiyaan bhi is bill par raji hai

 isamen se ek he kishoron main badhati porn dekhne kii lat
 Researchers and experts who study Child Psychology and Human Psychology believe that porn addiction among Indian teenagers is increasing rapidly
 iskaa sabase bada kaaran he unke haathon main internet kii uplabdhta
 The children of the world's richest person were forbidden to use mobiles
 Fathers give them mobiles to stay connected to their children
 par mobile main internet kii maujuudagi unhen kai laabh dene ke saath-saath porn kii duniya main bhi khinch rahaa he
 IHBAS Assistant Professor Psychiatrist Drs
 amit khanna ne bataaya ki kishoravastha main bacchon kaa mastishk bahut curious hota he
 In such a situation, after getting internet, they want to read, watch and understand many things
 kishoravastha main hi yadi baccha porn cites dekhne laga he to use kai tareekon se aap sambhaal sakate hai
 Pregnant women must eat these for a smart baby
 
 
 1
 Cut off the internet: If you are giving a mobile to your child from the point of view of safety, do not give internet in it
 ghar main wifai he to behatar hoga ki aap internet ko password protected rakhen or bachche ko password na bataaen
 These natural contraceptives are a million times better than pills2
 uskaa focus badal den: kishor agar porn cites dekhtaa he to aap uskaa focus change kar den
 That means make him BG in other works
 uske saath khelen, baaten karen, research or nai takneekon ke bare main baat karen
 Satan is empty minded
 baccha naa khaali hoga or naa wo porn dekh paaegaa
 3
 sakool main is par shiksha jaruri: bacchon ke teacher or skool administration se baat karen or skool main sex ajukeshan die jane par jor den
 4
 aap bhi baat karen: mata-pita aamtaur par bacchon ke saamne ye sari baaten karte hue sharmindagi mahasoos karte hai
 But you will not know the actual situation until you talk
 bachche ko aapse chupane kii jarurat nahin padegi
 Through conversation, you can end this habit
 pregnancy main mahilaayein is baat se sabase zyada darati hai
 
 
 5
 kahin koi cychetric dysorder to nahin : kai baar cychetric dysorder yani kisi tarah kii maansik beemaari kii vajah se bhi bacchon main ye aadat viksit ho jaati he
 If so, take the child to a psychiatrist
 kaise pahachaane cychetric dysorder he yaa nahin
 
 
 - Children struggling with psychiatric disorder are hyper active
 wo ek jagah sthir nahin baith sakate
 - Such children also have difficulty concentrating
 wo bahut mushkil se ek jagah dhyaan rakh pate hai
 - Are stubborn and get excited quickly
 agar aap apane bachche main ye lakshan dekh rahe hai to use kisi manochikitsak ke paas le jane main der na karen
 Because problems can also get bigger with age

 unhone mujhe dhairya banaaye rakhane ke liye kaha
 He saw me batting at the nets and said that i will play a big innings soon, either in Sri Lanka or in India a matches
 isse meraa kaaphi aatmavishvaas badha
 'khela Pujara said as he used to play,' he (dravid) believed that overall i had batted well in England and Australia tours
 bas main 30 yaa 40 ke apane score ko badi pariyon main nahin badal paa rahaa hum
 So i kept on doing what i was doing and kept playing as i played
 'banaae rakhi apni ekaagrathapujara ne kaha ki aaj duusare chor se wicket girane ke baavjood unhone apana naiysargik khel khelaa
 He said, 'I played my natural game

 i worked hard
 maine apni ekaagratha banaae rakhi
 My plan was simple, to try to rotate the strike and take the shine off the new ball
 ek baar jab main jam gaya to maine apane shot khilne shuru kar die or anya khiladiyon ke saath saajhedaariyaan nibhaai

 Kumar Sangakkara and Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the fourth edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Sunday after facing each other in the ICC World Cup final in Mumbai
 chidambaram stadium main ek baar phir ek duusare ke saamne honge
 Dhoni, who won the World Cup to the Indian team under his captaincy, is the captain of the ipl's Chennai Super Kings team, while the Sri Lankan captain, who is batting in the final, is commanding the Deccan Chargers in this edition of the IPL

 This time, along with Durga Puja, Deepawali and Chhath, the electoral festival will also be bright in Bihar
 chunaav ayog ne spasht sanket die hai ki bihar main vidhansabha chunaav oktober-november main hi honge
 The election was first reported in september-october
 is tarah bihar ke raajnneetik dalon ko apni ranneeti banane or usko amal main laane ke liye kuch or vakt miltaa dikh rahaa he
 In such a situation, we try to understand what are the strengths and weaknesses of the major political parties / coalitions in Bihar elections
 1
 RJD lost power in Bihar in 2005 and was marginalized in 2010
 This election is a golden opportunity for RJD to regain its old relevance and intimidation in the politics of Bihar
 nitish ko mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par sweekaar karne kaa ‘zehar’ lalu ko isi makasad se pinaa padaa
 However, the legal restriction of Lalu not being able to contest elections has increased the party's problems
 party kaaryakartaaon or duusare mahatvakantkshi netaaon main lalu parivaar kii duusari peedi- lalu ke donon beton or beti misa- ke prati waisi vafadari nahin dikhaai de rahi jaisi 90 ke dashak main lalu-rabari ke liye thi
 Opposition to Tej Pratap's candidacy in Mahua in Vaishali district makes this clear
 lalu ke liye sabase anukool raajnneetik halaat tab honge jab yah chunaav 90 ke dashak kii tarj par vishuddh rup se agade banaam pichde kii jang ban jaae
 Lalu knows that governance or delivery is not his strength
 lihaaja unke paas ‘saamaajik nyaay’, jaateey sameekaran or ‘dharmanirpekshata’ hi sabase bada hathiyaar he
 However, bjp's attempt to connect Kamandal with Mandal could become a thorn in Lalu's path
 obisi matadaataaon ke sabase bade samooh yani yadav matadaataaon kaa rukh kaaphi had tak chunavi nateezon par asar daalane vaala he

 jediujun 2013 tak endie kaa hissaa rahi jediu ke liye bijepi ke saath gathbandhan uske saamaajik aadhaar ko pukhta banaata tha
 JDU suddenly fell alone in Bihar politics after the end of the alliance
 samaaj ke ek bade tabake khaastaur se savarna jatiyon ne nitish kaa saath chhod diya
 Nitish has understood that despite all his efforts, the upper castes may not vote for the JDU, so they have left their own party mlas Anant Singh and Sunil Pandey on their side
 nitish ne gathbandhan us vakt todaa jab unka apana vot bank puri tarah se banakar taiyaar nahin hua tha
 The process of Mahadalit, the vote bank of the Backward Castes (EBC), which Nitish was engaged in putting in his court, was not completed till then
 isi vajah se loksabhaa chunaav main jediu sirf 2 siton tak simat gai
 It is clear from the Lok Sabha election results that barring Kurmi and Koiri, the other other dominant castes of Bihar did not vote in favor of JDU
 in sabake baavjood ‘sushasan’ or mukhyamantri ke taur par kiye gaye aarthik-saamaajik vikaas ke kaam or saaf chhavi nishchit hi nitish kii sabase badi takat he
 The absence of any clear leadership in the NDA alliance against him goes in favor of Nitish
 3
 The Bihar election is the most effective opportunity for BJP to cleanse the blot on Brand Modi due to the crushing defeat in NDA Delhi
 bihar fatah ke liye party ‘sam daam dand bhed’ sabakaa sahaara lene vaali he
 BJP wants to set the agenda for Bihar elections according to its own
 modi kii vikasvaadi raajnneeti or jaateey samikarnon kii jamini sachai ke bich talmail banane kii koshish chal rahi he
 The most ideal and easiest situation for the Janata Parivar would have been if the BJP had declared a leader as its chief ministerial candidate
 lalu-nitish kii dili tamanna hogi kii bijepi kisi savarna ko apana mukhyamantri ummidavaar banaae
 In such a situation, his desire to make Bihar election Mandal vs Kamandal will be easily fulfilled
 giriraaj singh ke is bayaan ko, ki koi savarna bihar kaa mukhyamantri nahin ban saktaa, isi prishthbhumi main dekhne kii zarurat he
 The BJP is desperately trying to get Lalu's Yadav voters and Nitish's Mahadalit and EBC voters into their ranks
 lalu-nitish-congress-ensipi ke paksh main muslim voton kii ekamusth golbandi bijepi ke liye nuksaandeh ho sakati he
 Therefore, the BJP has a challenge to bring many other social classes into its fold while retaining its current base
