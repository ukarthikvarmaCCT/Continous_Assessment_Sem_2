 7 may se ramadan ke paak maheene kii shuruyaat ho gai or iske saath hi soshal media par ek garma-garm bahes shuru ho gai he
 It is being said that on the occasion of Navratri, Shabana Azmi had said insult to the Hindu Goddess, to which Kangana Ranaut has given a befitting reply
 fasebuk,twitroor whatsap grups main kangana kii photo ke saath unke hawaale se ek daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki 'dambag kangana ke palatwaar se sann rah gai shabana'twitor par is post ko share karne waalon main bhartiya rigerv bank ke board ke sadsy es gurumurti bhi shaamil the
 However, he later deleted his tweet saying that he had said this on the basis of the information of qualified journalists
 india today fact check ne paaya ki kangana ranut ke hawaale se jo baat kahi ja rahi he wo saraasar managasaint he
 On searching, we could not find any such report which mentions Kangana saying so
 is baat kii pushti karne ke liye hamane kangana ke offis se sampark bhi kiya
 Neha Ansari, who has seen her public relations, told us that the statement that she is quoting on social media is old and there is no truth in it, but that does not mean that the statement of Shabana Azmi is also referring to Be wrong darasal shabana azmi ne do saal pehle durga ashtami ke dauraan ke dauraan ek twit main aisi hi kuch baat kahi thi
 Last month, after making some changes in what he said, he started being shared a lot on social media and there was some controversy about this
 shabana azmi ke bayaan ko lekar puri kahaniyahanpadhi ja sakati he
 Kangana may not have given a shrewd reply to Shabana for her statement as it is being claimed, but the conflict between Shabana and Kangana is not unjustified
 darasal, pulavama hamale ke baad kangana ne shabana azmi ko pakistan ke ek saanskrithik kaarykram kaa nimantran sweekaar karne ke liye deshadrohi kah diya tha
 Reports about this were published in several newspapers including DNA
 baad main shabana aazmi ne pakistan jane kaa kaarykram radd kar diya tha
 According to these reports, Kangana had said that people like Shabana Azmi support the gang that talks about breaking up India
 unhen jarurat kya thi ki pakistan main aise kaarykram kaa hissaa bane
 Now she is trying to save her image
 hamaari film industry aise deshadrohi logon se bhari padi he jo dushmano kaa hausala badhaate hai
 In place of garbage piles and traffic jams every ten steps, this Yamunapar is Krishna Nagar area of delhi from where bjp's CM candidate Kiran Bedi is in the fray
 vah abhi yahaan aane vaali hai lihaaja sadakon kii safai hui he
 The jeep is already ready, as soon as Kiran greets the people and the road show starts
 bhale hi yah seat beete do dashak se bijepi ke paas he, lekin iskaa yah bhi matlab nahin ki logon ko shikaayatein nahin hai
 Even the traditional BJP voters say that sewer problems have been there for years and so far no one has done anything
 krishna nagar kii ek gruhinee miki aroda ne kaha, "modi ji bas baahar yatraaen kar rahe hai, mere kichan main aane vaala saamaan to sasta nahin hua
 "kishanlal, who lives there, said that the AAP party has no base here
 thodaa aage badhane par najaara kuch badla hua tha
 Congress candidate Bansi Lal was campaigning from house to house with a drum and a small convoy
 unki patni nijee taur par logon se jaakar kah rahi thim, "aapane ab tak harshavardhan ji ko mauka diya he, ek mauka inhen bhi dijie
 
 
 " kiran bedi se takkar le rahe bansilaal kaa daawa he ki vah na sirf sthaneey samasyaon ko samajhate hai, balki bedi se behatar bhi hai
 He said that Bedi does not understand the local problems, but i am here, i know what to do and how to do it
 ilaake main aam aadmi party bhi apana jor laga rahi he
 At the moment their candidate SK Bagga is out of the city, the workers have taken charge
 kiran bedi ko apana siem ummidavaar banane ke baad party or kaaryakarta khush hon ki arvind kejariwal kaa karaara jawaab dhund liya he, lekin alaakaman ko yah bhalee-bhaanti pataa he ki dilli kii raah aasaan nahin he
 Even though Krishna Nagar is considered a safe seat for the BJP, here too Kiran Bedi is facing challenges and it takes time to make a place in the hearts of people
 har baar kii tarah is baar bhi phans tivi industry ke sabase lokapriy reality sho 'big bos' kaa besabri se intjaar kar rahe hai
 Now that it has been decided that even the tenth season of 'bigg Boss' will also host the 'sultan' of the industry, it is bound to be a high level of excitement for the fans of the show
 ek angreji antertenment website kii report ke mutabik 'big bos' kaa dasvaan sijan mid-oktober main shuru hone kii ummid he
 Not only this, Salman is also going to start shooting of this show soon after shooting some major scenes of Kabir Khan's film 'tubelight'
 bataa den ki is baar big bos' main aisa kuch hone ja rahaa he jo pehle kabhi nahin hua
 Actually this time the doors of the show's 10th season have also been opened to the common people
 abhi tak ke nau sijan main big bos ke ghar mencelibritihi hissaa lete aae hai
 But Abklars Channel is going to fulfill the wishes of those who wish to participate in the show

 2 big films are releasing later this year
 in donon hi filmon kaa bajet 100 karod se upar he
 The first film is Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh and Shahid Kapoor starrer Padmavati, which is releasing on December 1
 duusari he salmaan khan or katrina caff starer tiger jinda he, jo 22 disambar ko relies hogi
 Padmavati has already had many controversies
 bade str par ban rahi is film ke mujeec or first luk ko pasand kiya gaya he
 The total budget of this film is 150-170 crores
 film trade ke jaankaron ke anusaar ye film shuruaati taur par 140-150 karod kii kamai kar sakati he
 Tiger Zinda Hai, directed by sultan-turned-ali Abbas Zafar, is also in the news due to the action scene and Salman Khan's stardom
 8 din main 8 record: Box Office par saal kii duusari badi film bani golmaalatiger jinda he kaa bajet 100-120 karod rupye he
 According to trade experts, it can do business of 22 to 25 crores on opening day
 film shuruaati taur par 100-120 karod kaa bijness kar sakati he
 Experts are positive about both films
 tiger jinda he ko christmas or new year kii chhutityon kaa laabh milanaa tay he
 Secret Superstar earned 66 crores in the first week, Golmaal 164
goal that Golmaal Again has also got special benefit of holidays recently
 yah film saal 2017 main bharat main sabase zyada kamai karne vaali duusari hindi film ban gai he
 On the first number is the Hindi version of 'bahubali' and on the third is 'judwaa 2'
 2017 kii sabhi badi filmon ko peeche chhodte hue 'golmaal agen' is saal kii sabase badi openar film bani he
 On the first day, the film opened to over 30 crores
 iske saath hi film ne tubalite ke 21 karod or rais ke 20 karod kii opening ko kaaphi peeche chhod diya he
 Prashant Bhushan, a key member of Team Hazare, has stated in clear words that Anna Hazare will come out of jail only after being allowed to go on 'unconditional' fast
 mashhoor vakil or lokapal kii saajha masauda samiti main shaamil bhushan ne kaha ki hajaare abhi jail main bane rahenge
 He said, "hazare will remain in jail until he gets permission to go on an unconditional fast at JP Park or any other place
" iske baad ham sarkaar ke saath charchaa karne ko taiyaar hai
 But this is not possible before
 ’prashanth bhushan ne kaha, ‘ucchtam nyaayalay kaa rukh karne se pehle hamen anna ke saath charchaa kerani he
 He said that Gandhian leaders would come out of jail if the authorities allow Hazare to sit on unconditional hunger strike
 bhushan ne maang kii he ki chhatrasaal stadium main band sabhi logon ko sahi khaanaa or pani muhaiyaa karaayaa janaa chahie
 He said that many processions will be taken out all over the country
 shaayad sahi vakt par sahi sawaal akasar isiilie nahin puche jate kyonki unka jawaab yaa to anpekshit hota he yaa apritikar
 For example, the question is whether a prime minister becomes strong or weak after re-election? The record of all the democratic countries of the world has been disappointing in this matter
 jis cheez ko utsaah or urja kaa bis hona chahie, vah dhire-dhire bhram kaa shikaar hoti chali jaati he
 The reason for this should not be found in the leadership but in the system
 pehle kaarykaal ke agenda main buniyadi taur par vah mahatvakanksha hoti he ki agali baar bhi pari khelni he
 That is why it becomes possible to prepare a practical layout of the fiscal according to the immediate needs of the people
 duusare kaarykaal main thakaan or mugalata, donon ho jate hai
 Democracy like America has abolished the system of third term
 bharat main haalanki jawaharlal nehru ke alaava or koi sarkaar teesri baar raaj nahin kar pai
 That too became an old thing
 dobaaraa chune gaye pradhanmantri kaa dhyaan buniyadi chizon se hat jaataa he
 He keeps on being satisfied in his chair
 uske hone kaa koi vyapak arth nahin hota, sivaay uski kuch nijee vilasitaon ke, jaise vishwa shikhar sammelnon main bhagidaari aadi
 All opportunities fall prey to this kind of pre-planned dramatics, while ideas are largely subject to such bestialities as are not possible to fulfill — such as world peace and so on
 yadi aapako aisa lagata he ki dow
 Manmohan Singh is doing the same three things because it is exactly what he is doing
 eemaandaaree se dekhie to 2009 main hi unhone elaan kar diya tha ki ve bhavishya ke liye nahin hai or na hi bhavishya unka he, jab ve rahul gandhi kii ichha par kisi bhi vakt kursi chhodane kii peshkash kar rahe the
 Obviously, the next election will not be for him, but for Rahul Gandhi - whether he wins or loses
 manmohan singh kii yah niskriyata bhi kargar ho sakati thi, yadi koi aisa hota jo nitigat kaman apane haath main liye rahata, lekin aisa koi nahin jo jahaaj ko rajnatik manzil kii taraf le jaae
 The problem is that Sonia Gandhi herself has forgotten the way because her chosen Khevanhar, her son, lost an opportunity in Uttar Pradesh, where there was scope for the next generation to take the lead
 ab ve saal ke bache hue dinon main videsh rahen yaa desh main, koi fark nahin padataa kyonki yahaan rahete hue bhi ve saarvajanik jivan main koi aisa yogadan to dete nahin jisase unki yaa congress kii koi pahchaan ban sake
 The condition of the Congress is that it is beating hands and feet in the air at this time and the floor is not known
 haa, paseene se tar-batar jaruri ho rahi he
 In such a situation, a man like Pranab Mukherjee could certainly take command, as he did between 2004 and 2009
 lekin ve is baat se mutmain the ki congress unhen manmohan singh kaa uttaradhikari nahin banane vaali
 That is why, taking practical steps, he made a leap to Rashtrapati Bhavan where at least there is an opportunity for ideological leadership
 basharte aapke dimag main vichaar hon
 Secondly, this position is above and far from political threats
 unke baad sabase varisht cabinet sadsy hai sharad pavaar, lekin unki party main das saansad bhi nahin hai
 So they cannot expect even a miracle to become the chieftain of the alliance
 pradhanmantri kii takat ek arth main uske pad se nirpeksh hoti he
 He is as powerful as his personal abilities and limitations are subject to the circumstances
 dow
 The only reason Singh's second term was ineffective is that he kept himself out of every controversy
 is tarah nirpeksh bhav rakhkar unhone darasal apane record ko hi nuksaan pahunchaaya he, jo unki iklauti thati he
 Now neither his cabinet nor his party is ready to listen and obey his words
 bhavishya kii chaabi rahul gandhi ko di gai he, lekin ve use thaamne ko hi taiyaar nahin
 It is not possible that someone else will carry out their work well and they will continue to gather accolades
 aaj congress main koi badi pratibha bachi nahin he
 So despite all the reluctance to prove himself, Congress Dr
 singh se chipki hui he
 The government started walking and running and has now sat down
 congress kii kismat kaa sabase ashaavadi akalan uski kshamta main nahin, balki matadaata kii is ummid par tikaa he ki congress kaa vikalp usase bhi badtar he
 The theory is that the Congress only has to complete this term
 baaki teesraa kaarykaal uske paas khud chalakar aa jayega
 Sometimes speaking several people simultaneously gives the impression that something is happening
 pranab mukherjee ne jab istipha diya, to aisa hi hua tha jab media ke ek hisse ne akalan kiya ki 1991 kii tasviir dobaaraa duharai jane vaali he
 But 1991 was the beginning of the first term, not the end of the last term
 us vakt vichaaron kaa visphot ho rahaa tha or unhen kriyanvit karne kaa utsaah bhi tha
 Despite this, Narasimha Rao did not get a second term
 aakhri dinon main unka akelaapan unke uttaradhikariyon ke liye drushtaant he
 Union Minister Nitin Gadkari today sought the support of the Congress on the issue, reiterating the bjp's commitment to create a separate Vidarbha state from Maharashtra
 sadak parivahan, rajmarg or jahajrani mantri ne ek kaarykram ke dauraan kaha, bhaajapa ne vaada kiya tha ki agar vah maharashtra main sata main aati he to vah alag vidarbha rajya banaaegi
 The party had also passed a resolution in its National Executive held in Bhubaneswar and hence we are not backing down on this issue
 vidarbha aarthik vikaas parishad kii taraf se ‘vikaas kii raajnneeti’ par yojit ek kaarykram ke dauraan gadakari ne kaha, congress ko nae rajya ke gathan ke liye samarthan dena chahie kyonki do
 
 tihaai bahumat (sansad main) kii jarurat he
 He was accompanied by former Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan on the dais
 mantri ne kaha ki bhaajapa hameshaa chote rajyon kii pakshdhar rahi he
 He said that the party established small states like Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand and played an important role in the creation of Telangana when it was in opposition
 gadakari ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kaamkaaj kii style kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki is aarope main koi sachai nahin he ki vah ‘taanashaah’ hai
 On the issue of corruption, Gadkari said that there is a need to change the law in the country to eradicate corruption
 unhone kaha, bhrashtachar ko mitaane ke liye hamane kuch pahal kii he
 
 kshetreey parivahan praadhikaranon main online kaamkaaj is disha main pehla kadam he
 In the program, Chavan said, the younger generation defeated the ruling parties in the state elections due to allegations of corruption against the Democratic Front government in Maharashtra and presenting it in the media
 unhone kaha ki ‘gathbandhan sarkaar kii baadhyataa ke kaaran’ centre or maharashtra main bhi sarkaron ne bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke khilaaf prabhavi kadam nahin uthaae
 The former chief minister also expressed grief over the delay in prosecution in corruption cases and said that it took up to 18 years for some cases to be decided
 chavaan ne maharashtra kii bhaajapa sarkaar par sthaneey nikaay kar (elbiti) ko radd karne ke chunavi vaade se peeche hatane ke bhi aarope lagaae 
 Gadkari, however, claimed that state Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had met him this morning and assured that 'LBT will be abolished within a month'

 jon ne kaha ki film ek drishy madhyam he
 Everyone from Shah Rukh to Aamir is conscious about his bodybuilding
 unhen lagata he ki unka sharir acha dikhnaa chahie, lekin mere liye sirf kad lathi hi sab kuch nahin rahi
 My fans admire my bodybuilding so i don't want to lose it
 jon ne kaha, ‘mere jaisi shaareerik banaavat paane ke liye log marate hai or maine bhi ise hasil karne ke liye bahut mehnat kii he to phir main iskaa phayda kyon na uthaaun
 The 28-year-old actor is now beginning to feel that Bollywood's time is changing and filmmakers are now looking at him from a different perspective
 jon ne kaha ki film nirdeshkon kii soch badal rahi he or ab vah jon abraham ko sirf uski shandaar fijic kii vajah se kisi film ke liye nahin chunate
 He said that now he has more faith in me and the filmmakers are also trusting him more
 jon ne kaha, ‘aaj jab sanjay gupta mujhase ‘shootout at wadala’ film kii baat karte hai to vah mujhe bataate hai ki isamen main maharashtra ke ek dhili kameez pahanane vaale vyakti kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahaa hum

 jaanien un 10 baton ko jinka zikr karte hue raghuram rajan ne kaha ki bhartiya arthvyavastha ke liye inhen nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa:1
 Raghuram Rajan pointed out unrealistic expectations to the Central Government
 iske liye unhone ‘safed ghode par bainthe ronaald reagan’ ke jumale kaa istemaal bhi kiya
 Saying this, Rajan said that the government is responsible for economic growth in the country because they have to do the investment work together with the private and government sector
 2
 Rajan said that the job of the Reserve Bank is to create an atmosphere of trust in view of the value of the rupee, inflation and macroeconomic stability

 So, as the country goes on the path of progress, the institutions that create real expectations will also develop

 com / ot9nng4vcxa post shared by Zoom TV (@zoomtv) on Dec 2, 2018 at 7:39 pm PST kendriya film pramann board ne arthshaastri amartya sen par bani ek documentry ke pradarshan main avrodh paidaa karte hue nirdeshak suman ghosh ko isamen se gaay, gujarat or hindutv jaise shabdon ko mut karne ko kaha he
 The documentary, titled The Argumentative Indian, was planned to be released in Kolkata this weekend but Ghosh refused to mute the four words of the cbfc's Kolkata regional office, which has now led to uncertainty over its release
 in shabdon main hindu india bhi he
 In the documentary, Sen is shown speaking these words
 sibiefasi ke is kadam kii tikhi ninda karte hue mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne chintaa jataai he vahiin ghosh ne kaha ki vah stabdh hai or sadamein main hai
 He tweeted, every voice of the opposition is being suppressed
 ab, dow amartya sen, agar unke jaise kad kaa koi vyakti apni baat aazaadee se vyakt nahin kar saktaa to aam naagarik kya ummid rakhe
 Ghosh said that extracting a few words from a conversation between 83-year-old Amartya Sen and interviewer-economist Kaushik Basu would not make life in the panorama
 ghosh ne bataaya ki sibiefasi ke kshetreey karyaalay ne jin chaar shabdon ko mut karne ke liye kaha he ve hai gujarat, gaay, hindutv vyuu of india or hindu india
 Ghosh said that i expressed my inability to do this, it is a documentary and on a person who has international stature
 main stabdh hum
 He revealed that he had plans to release the film this weekend
 unhone kaha, main unke likhit sandesh kaa intjaar kar rahaa hum or dekh rahaa hum ki kya ve film ko sibiefasi, mumbai bhejenge
 But in any case my answer will be the same
 bhaajapa ne amartya senpper bani documentry se jude sensor board ke faisle kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki nobel puraskaar vijeta hone kaa matlab yah nahin he ki koi jo chaahe use vah kehane kaa adhikaar mil jaataa he
 The Argumentative Indian documentary was scheduled to be released this weekend but the regional office of the censor board put a stop to the film's director Suman Ghosh by directing that he was told by Sen in the film Cow, Gujarat, Hindutva View of India and Mute the words Hindu India
 pashchim bengal bhaajapa ke adhyaksh dilip ghosh ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki main sensor board ke faisle kaa samarthan karata hum
 They did what they thought was right, the board has a lot of learned people and they must have decided after considering all aspects
 unhone kaha, agar aap ek nobel puraskaar vijeta hai to iskaa yah matlab nahin he ki aap jo chaahe, aapako vah kehane kaa adhikaar mil jaataa he
 In the documentary, Sen talks about social choice theory, development economics, philosophy and the rise of right-wing nationalism around the world, including India
 film main 15 saal :2002-2017: kii avadhi darj he or yah sen tathaa unke arthshaastri chaatr kowshik basu ke bich baatcheet ke rup main pesh kii gayi he
 Chief Minister Jeetan Ram Manjhi has rebelled in the midst of a fresh political storm in Bihar
 ek ore maanjhi ne 20 farvari ko vidhayak dal kii baithak bula lee he to vahiin duusari taraf sutron ke hawaale se khabar aa rahi he ki mukhyamantri maanjhi nitish kumaar camp ke chaar mantriyon ko barkhaast kar sakate hai
 Actually the whole matter started when JDU president Sharad Yadav called a meeting of all ministers and mlas of Bihar on 7 February
 sharad yadav ke dwaara baithak bulaae jane kaa jithan ram maanjhi ne virodh karte hue kaha ki ye asanvaidhanik he
 However, Nitish Mishra and Vrishin Patel, ministers in the Bihar government, have also stepped up their protest against the removal of Jitan Ram Manjhi
 donon hi netaaon ne sharad yadav kii ore se bulaai gai is baithak main jane se inkaar kar diya he
 'manjhi has won the hearts of the mlas' Nitish Mishra, in a special conversation till today, admitted that the party has been torn apart
 mishra ne kaha, 'vidhayak dal ko baithak bulaane kaa adhikaar sirf mukhyamantri ko he
 Sharad Yadav's calling of the legislature party meeting is wrong and unconstitutional
 parde ke peeche party ke log jithan ram maanjhi ko apamaanit karne par tule hai
 Nitish Mishra also said that the Chief Minister has won the hearts of mlas in the last 8-9 months
 philhal is maamle main aage kii ranneeti banane ke liye mukhyamantri awaas par baithkon kaa daur jari he
 All Ministers and mlas who are pro-manjhi have started reaching the Chief Minister's residence
 narendra singh, vrishin patel, nitish mishra, mahachandra prasad singh, gyanendra singh gyanu or samraat choudhary mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ke saath aage kii ranneeti taiyaar karne main jute gaye he
 a win in three matches helped Bangalore to two points
 lekin unke pehle match main unhen dephending champion kolkata ke kilaaf jeet mili bhi to gail kii tufaani pari kii vajah se
 Gayle scored 96 runs in 56 balls with 7 fours and 7 sixes against Eden Gardens in that match against Kolkata and snatched the match from Kolkata's mouth
 kuch aisa hi dhamaakaa abi divilliars ne mumbai ke kilaaf match main kiya
 De Villiers scored 41 runs in 11 balls with 5 fours and 3 sixes in that match played in Bangalore, but could not win the team
 darasal viraat kohli kii team ko har department main behatar pradarshan karne kii zarurat he
 Probably need to click together
 varanaa points teble main wo filhal sabase peeche chal rahe hai or chennai unhen itani aasaani se upar nahin chadhane denevaala
 However, Virat Kohli's team has to play the next match at home ground
 lekin hairaani kii baat he ki abi divilliars (3 maichon main 115 ran), kris gail (3 maichon main 127 ran) or viraat kohli (3 maichon main 72 ran) jaise dhamaakedaar ballebaazon kii ye team abtak maat khaati nazar aa rahi he
 There is no dearth of options in this team's batting
 dhamaakedaar top order ke alaava dinesh karthik (3 maichon main 33 ran), raili ruso (1 match main 0) or david visa (1 match main 47 ran) jaise ballebaaz team ke majboot batting kram kaa ishaara karte hai
 But the important thing is that Australian fast bowler Mitchell Starc has fit
 pichley sizan 14 match main 14 wicket hasil karanevaale michel stark (injuri se vaapasi), wies chahal (3 match main 7
 5 wickets with an economy of 00) and Varun Aaron (10 in 3 matches)
 94 kii iconmi ke saath 1 wicket) jaise khilaadiyon ke saath team kii gendbaazi main jaan daal sakate hai
 The Bangalore team may get a little relief that Chennai have lost to Rajasthan in the last match
 wo ummid kar sakate hai ki isse chennai kaa tevar zarur naram padaa hoga
 But Brendon mccullum (162 runs in 4 matches), Dwayne Smith (163 runs in 4 matches), Captain MS Dhoni (117 runs in 4 matches), Suresh Raina (65 runs in 4 matches), Faf du Plessy (44 in 4 matches) Runs) and batsmen like Ravindra Jadeja (17 runs in 4 matches), the two-time IPL champion, Chennai, predict the strength
 tippaniyan Ashish Nehra (6 in 4 matches)
 93 kii iconmi ke saath 6 wicket), dwen braavo (4 match main 8
 7 wickets with an economy of 44), r Ashwin (2 wickets 7 in 4 matches)
 36 kii iconmi ke saath) or mohit sharma (4 match main 4 wicket 9
 With an economy of 06) are the team's dependable bowlers
 pichley match main chennai kii haar ke baavjood unhen kamazor samajhane kii galati koi bhi team management nahin karnaa chahega
 Therefore, there seems to be more than one reason for the match between Bangalore and Chennai to be exciting
 gail ne kolkata ke kilaaf us match main eden gardens par 7 chauke or 7 chakke ke sahare 56 gendon main 96 ran banaae or match ko kolkata ke munh se chin liya
 AB de Villiers did something similar in the match against Mumbai
 divilliars ne bengalooru main khele gaye us match main 5 chauke or 3 chakke ke sahare sirf 11 gendo main 41 ran banaaye, lekin team ko jeet nahin dilaa sake
 Actually, Virat Kohli's team needs to perform better in every department
 shaayad ek saath clic karne kii zarurat he
 Otherwise, they are currently lagging behind in the points table and Chennai will not allow them to climb so easily
 haalanki viraat kohli kii team ko aglaa muqaabala gharelu maidan par hi khelnaa he
 Surprisingly, this team of the dashing batsmen like AB de Villiers (115 runs in 3 matches), Chris Gayle (127 runs in 3 matches) and Virat Kohli (72 runs in 3 matches) are still seen to be defeated
 is team kii ballebaazi main vikalpon kii kami nahin
 Apart from the top order, the batsmen like Dinesh Karthik (33 runs in 3 matches), Riley Russo (0 in 1 match) and David Visa (47 runs in 1 match) indicate the strong batting order of the team
 lekin ahm ye he ki australian tej gendbaaz michel stark fit ho gaye hai
 Mitchell Starc (return from injury), YS Chahal (7 from 3 matches), who took 14 wickets in 14 matches last season
 00 kii iconmi ke saath 5 wicket) or varun aron (3 match main 10
 With an economy of 94, 1 wicket) can put life into the team's bowling with players like
 bengalooru team ko thodi raahat isse mil sakati he ki chennai ko pichley match main rajasthan ke haathon haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 They can hope that this will definitely soften Chennai's attitude
 magar brendan makkulam (4 match main 162 ran), dwen smith (4 match main 163 ran), captain emes dhoni (4 match main 117 ran), suresh raina (4 match main 65 ran), faif du placi (4 match main 44 ran) or rabindra jadeja (4 match main 17 ran) jaise ballebaaz do baar kii ipel champion chennai kii taaqat kaa andaaza karavaate hai
 The comments ashish nehra (4 match main 6
 6 wickets with an economy of 93), Dwayne Bravo (8 in 4 matches)
 44 kii iconmi ke saath 7 wicket), aar aswin (4 match main 2 wicket 7
 With an economy of 36) and Mohit Sharma (4 wickets 9 in 4 matches)
 06 kii iconmi ke saath) team ke bharosemand gendbaaz hai
 Despite the defeat of Chennai in the last match, no team management would mistake the mistake of considering them weak
 isliye bengalooru or chennai ke match ke romaanchak hone kii ek se zyaada vajahen nazar aa rahi hai

 june maheene ke ant main rashtriya jaanch agency (enie) ne hyderabad se 7 logon ko aatanki sanghathan iesas se jude hone or bharat par hamale kii sajeesh rachane ke aarope main giraftaar kiya tha
 NDTV has received statements from 5 of the 7 people, highlighting many disturbing aspects of isis's reach in India
 inase pataa chalata he ki yah aatanki sanghathan apane gurgon ke liye kam se kam 3 bhartiya rajyon main kis tarah hathiyaaron or visphotakon kii vyavastha karata he
 The statements made by the accused in custody cannot be used as evidence in the court, but the NIA says that digital records, confiscated weapons, ammunition and explosives as well as statements of witnesses would have confirmed these confessions
 is
 enie ke mutabik, is sajeesh kaa mukhya sandigdh hyderabad ke puraane shahar se taalluk rakhane vaala 31 varshiya ejeeniyar ibrahim yajdani he, jo ki saudi arab main naukari ke dauraan pehali baar iesas kii taraf aakarshith hua
 Abraham, in his detailed 28-page statement, said he was in contact with an online handler named Abu Isa Al Amerikan, who asked him to go to Syria
 haalanki kai aavednon ke baavjood use vija nahin mil paaya
 After which the handler asked him to stay in India and make a group of people like him and attack here
 enditivi ko mili is samooh ke 5 logon ke bayaan se pataa chalata he ki unka pehla kadam iesas ke amir (pramukh) abu bakar al bagdadi ke prati vafadari kii kasam khaani hoti thi
 (NIA claims that they have obtained these affidavits by decoding the software, which has signatures of all the seven accused)
 Ibrahim and Ilyas's brother Ishaq Yazdani says a false case has been filed against his brother ibrahim ke bayaan main handlers ke nirdeshon kaa bhi zikr he, jisamen use galaap or tutanota jaise ikripted software ke jariye shapathpatr aplod karne or phir saare physical or digital records mitaane ke nirdesh die gaye the
 However, what comes after this makes them different from the groups arrested earlier
 ibrahim or peshey se computer thik karne vaale habib ke mutabik, unke handler ne unhen hathiyaar ekatra karne ke liye maharashtra ke nanded main pehle se tay ek jagah par jane ko kaha
 Abraham said that there used to be a polythene bag hanging on a tree near the wall of the airport complex, which was a secret mark for him
 isi ped ke aasapaas kii jhaadiyon main ek bag tha, jisamen do pistaul or 20 round goliyaan thi
 When these guns were found to be defective, the handler asked them to take a second detour to Ajmer in Rajasthan
 aglaa kadam visphotak hasil karnaa tha, jiske liye is samooh ko zyada dur nahin janaa padaa
 According to Ibrahim and Habib, the handler had arranged for him a sack of sugar and ammonium nitrate, which he had to bring from Budhan Pochampally, about 50 km from Hyderabad
 iske baad usne unhen ghar main hi bam banane ke bare main bataaya
 According to Abraham, his new handler seemed to be North Indian and especially from Bihar or Uttar Pradesh, as he used to speak in an accent like 'I tell, say, you have to do this, yes i have got it'
 tippaniyan However, the family of these accused denies all the allegations as wrong
 ibrahim or eliyas ke bhai ishak yazdani kehete hai ki unke bhai ke khilaaf jhootha cese darj kiya gaya he
 He says that Abraham is a young man who reads and has never contacted ISIS
 enie ke in sabooton kii satyata kii jaanch to court main hogi, lekin abhi tak kii jaanch main agency ke haath lage subut bharat main iesas ke gahare network kii maujuudagi kii ore ishaara karte hai

 According to the NIA, the prime suspect of the plot is Abraham Yazdani, a 31-year-old engineer hailing from the old city of Hyderabad, who was first attracted to ISIS during his job in Saudi Arabia
 ibrahim ne 28 pannon ke apane vistrut bayaan main kaha he ki vah abu isa al amareeki naam ke ek online handler ke sampark main tha, jisane usase syria jane ko kaha tha
 However, despite many applications, he could not get a visa
 jiske baad handler ne use bharat main hi rukne or yahaan apane jaise kuch or logon kaa samooh banaakar hamale karne ko kaha
 The statements of 5 people from this group found on NDTV show that their first step was to swear loyalty to ISIS 'emir (chief) Abu Bakr al Baghdadi
 (enie kaa daawa he ki unhone software dicode kar ye shapathpatr hasil kar liye hai, jinamein saaton aropiyon ke hastakshar hai)ibrahim or eliyas ke bhai ishak yazdani kehete hai ki unke bhai ke khilaaf jhootha cese darj kiya gaya he Abraham's statement also mentions handlers' instructions instructing them to upload affidavits through encrypted software such as Gulfup and Tutanotta and then erase all physical and digital records
 haalanki iske baad jo baat saamne aati he, vah inhen pehle giraftaar kiye gaye samoohon se alag banaati he
 According to Ibrahim and a computer-correcting Habib, his handler asked him to go to a pre-determined location in Nanded, Maharashtra to collect weapons
 ibrahim ne bataaya ki vahaan airport parisar kii diwaar ke paas ek ped par polithine bag tanga hota tha, jo ki unke liye gopneey nishaan tha
 The bushes surrounding this tree had a bag, which contained two pistols and 20 rounds of bullets

 chunaav ke liye raajnneetik dalon main garmaahat pehle hi mahasoos kii ja rahi he
 Before the 2019 elections, there is all-round pressure on the Modi government from inside the house to bring a law in the house for the construction of Ram temple and clear the way for the construction of the temple at Ramjanmabhoomi in Ayodhya
 khud rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke vijaydashami kaarykram main sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne apane sambodhan main kaha tha ki ram mandir ke liye kanoon bananaa chahie
 It was a direct gesture that keeping in mind the sentiments of the supporters of the Sangh and BJP and those who have faith in Ram, the Modi government should bring a law for the Ram temple in the House
 modi sarkaar par mandir nirmaan ke liye dabaav kam nahin he
 From responding to activists and voters on the ground, showing themselves committed to building the temple is becoming essential for the BJP
 duusari ore santon ne sarkaar ko is mudde par gherna shuru kar diya he ki mandir nirmaan main deree ve bardaasht nahin karenge
 The saints say that the BJP has forgotten its promise to build the temple and why the statement of waiting for the decision of the Supreme Court is being given repeatedly by the party
 sunwaayee se pehle centre main mantri giriraaj singh ne kaha ki ab hinduon kaa sabar tut rahaa he
 After the hearing was postponed, the saints of Ayodhya also asked why the hearing was postponed again and again
 dhyaan rahe ki santon ke ek bade varg or ram mandir andolan se jude mahanton ne is varsh 6 disambar se ayodhya main mandir nirmaan kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 The Sant Samaj says that they will start the work of temple construction, if the government wants to stop then stop
 santon kaa yah aahvaan sarkaar ke liye kam chunauteepurn nahin he
 It will be very difficult for the Modi government at the Center and the Yogi government in the state to use any kind of force to stop the saints
 isse bhaajapa ko apane samarthakon ke bich khaasaa nuksaan jhelana pad saktaa he
 This announcement of Sant Samaj has got a kind of legitimacy from today's speech of the Sangh chief
 sangh ne spasht kar diya he ki wo ram mandir ke liye court ke faisle kaa intazaar nahin karnaa chahta or sarkaar iske liye kaanoon laakar mandir nirmaan kaa rasta saaf kare

 3 minute kii kaarywahi or 3 maheene ke liye tal gai ayodhya kii sunwaayeesarkaar laaegi vidheyak?aisi sthiti main bhaajapa ke paas ab ek hi rasta bachataa nazar aa rahaa he or wo yah he ki ram mandir ke prati apni patibaddhta ko sthapit karne ke liye modi sarkaar sadan ke aagaamee sheetakaaleen satr main ram mandir ke vidheyak ko rakhe
 BJP also benefits from this
 pehla to yah ki sarkaar logon ke bich chunaav se thik pehle yah sthapit karne main safal hogi ki unki manshaa ram mandir ke prati kya he
 She will be able to tell her voters that at least BJP and Modi are committed to building Ram temple in Ayodhya
 doosraa laabh yah he ki vipaksh ke liye yah ek sahaj sthiti nahin hogi
 Opposition will break this
 congress ke liye yah aasaan nahin hoga ki wo ram mandir par prastaav kaa virodh karke apni soft hindutv kii puri koshishon ko mitti main mila de
 This will also cause a split in the opposition and there will be a dent in the vote bank of parties like SP BSP
 dhyaan rahe ki santon or matadaataaon ke bich sandesh dene ke liye chunaav se thik pehle modi sarkaar ke saamne yah ek ahm or antim mauka he
 Even during the Kumbh starting in Prayag from January, the government will have to clarify its accountability to the temple in front of the Sant Samaj
 modi sarkaar ke liye aagaamee sheetakaaleen satr is sarkaar kaa antim satr hoga
 The subsequent budget session will end with a mid-term budget and the country will enter the general election
 chunaav se thik pehle apane matadaataaon ke bich ram mandir ke liye vishwaas jataana sarkaar ke liye zaruri he
 It remains to be seen how far the government goes to show this belief

 kuch saal pehle aisa mauka bhi aayaa jab purv vitt mantri arun jetali ko hoicourt main ram jethmalani ke sawaalon ko saamana karnaa padaa tha or is dauraan tikhi bahes kii bhi baat saamne ai thi
 In fact, Arun Jaitley had sued Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for defamation in DCA
 adaalat main arun jetali ke daleelon kaa saamana karne ke liye arvind kejariwal ko ram jethmalani hi sabase behatar vakil lage
 Then what was the law experts waiting for the day when these two big lawyers of the country were going to face each other in the court
 aakhir vah din aayaa jab kathghare main arun jetali khadey the or sawaal puch rahe the ram jethmalanilekin taarikh 17 may saal 2017 ko aakhir vah din aa hi gaya
 When there was a heated debate between Ram Jethmalani and Arun Jaitley
 or purv vitt mantri ram jethmalani ke ravaiye se naaraaz ho gaye
 Ram Jethmalani used the word CROOK (crook) for Arun Jaitley
 sanyukt register deepali sharma ke samaksh upasthit vitt mantri apana aapa kho baithe or jethmalani se poocha ki kya kejariwal se nirdesh lekar unke khilaaf is shabd kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 Jaitley said, "if this is the case, i will increase the charges against the defendant (kejriwal)
 " unhone kaha ki nijee durbhaavna kii bhi ek seemaa he
 Senior Advocates Rajeev Nair and Sandeep Sethi, who are representing Jaitley, also said that Jethmalani is asking derogatory questions and that he should restrain himself from asking irrelevant questions because "the case is Arun Jaitley vs Arvind Kejriwal and it is Ram Jethmalani vs Arun Jaitley Is not
 " is par jethmalani ne kaha ki unhone is shabd kaa istemaal kejariwal ke nirdesh par kiya he
 a group of lawyers, including Jethmalani, who is defending AAP leaders, also said that Jaitley is not entitled to a claim of Rs 10 crore for his alleged defamation
 jetali ne kejariwal or paanch anya aap netaaon raghav chaddha, kumaar vishwaas, ashutosh, sanjay singh or deepak bajpeyi ke khilaaf manahani kaa mukadmaa daayar karke 10 karod rapaye ke kshatipurti kii maang kii thi

 Several petitions were filed in this regard in the Supreme Court
 yachikakartaon kaa kahana tha ki yah adhyadesh asanvaidhanik he or ise lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa
 This ordinance is violating the right to contest elections given by the Constitution
 agar ise lagu kiya jayega to kareeb 95 fisadi mahilaayein apane haq se vanchit ho jaaengi, jabaki 80 fisadi log isse prabhavit honge
 The Government of Rajasthan never made any effort to increase the schools or raise the standard of education in the state
 haalanki supreme court ne is maamle main dakhal dene se inkaar kar diya or mukhya nyaayadhish justise echel dattu ne kaha ki unhen is maamle ko lekar hoicourt janaa chahie
 It was said on behalf of the petitioner that Tuesday is the last date for filing nominations and in such a situation they should get some time, but the apex court denied it
 idhar, sarkaar kii taraf se pesh hue atorni general mukul rohtagi ne court ko bataaya ki isi tarah kii kareeb chah yachikaayen hoicourt main pehle hi lambit hai
 While hearing similar petitions, the Rajasthan High Court has issued a notice to the government and the Election Commission seeking an answer
 ye jawaab 12 janvari tak hoicourt main daakhil karnaa hoga
 But the High Court has not put any restriction on the electoral process
 mangalvaar ko nanmacan daakhil karne kii aakhri taarikh he
 Here, former minister Sachin Pilot was also present in the Supreme Court in this case
 is maamle main saaf he ki congress or anya sanghathan rajya sarkaar ke khilaaf morcha kholane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 It is evident that in the coming days this issue can become quite hot in the politics of the state

 Expelled BJP leader Jaswant Singh on Friday said he was "thrilled" by the High Court's dismissal of the Gujarat government's ban on his controversial book on Pakistan founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah
 gujarat ucch nyaayalay ke faisle par unhone kaha, ‘‘main atyadhik romanchit hum
 "not a derogatory comment against Sardar Patale
 He, however, regretted that the court had to intervene to protect freedom of expression
" unhone kaha, ‘‘antat: adaalat kaa abhivyakti kii swatantraaa kii raksha main aage aana bharat ke raajnneetik varg par tippanee he
 It is also a positive comment on the judiciary
 ’’ yah poochne par ki kya unki pustak par gujarat sarkaar ke pratibandh ko vahaan ke ucch nyaayalay dwaara khaarij kiya janaa abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ko sahi tehraana he, jaswant ne kaha, ‘‘nihsandeh
 Soon after Jaswant was expelled from the BJP just before the contemplation meeting in Shimla, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi announced a ban on his book, saying that Sardar Patel was responsible for partition of the country
 Image has been spoiled
 jaswant ne kaha ki gujarat sarkaar kaa yah daawa ekadam galat he
 He said, "this charge is very regrettable
 pustak main patel kaa ullekh chah yaa saat baar aayaa he or ek baar bhi mahaan sardaar patel ke khilaaf koi apmanjanak tippanee nahin he
 "principles will always weigh heavily" Jaswant strongly criticized the support of both BJP and Congress in Gujarat for banning his book
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ congress or bhaajapa donon hi aisa vot kii khatir kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, when you place the vote on one pan of the scales and the principles on the other, the pan of principles will always be overwhelming
 desh bhar main ham sab bharatvasiyon ko is sawaal par gambhirtha se sochna chahie
 The former foreign and finance minister said that banning or burning the book is not the answer
 uttar yah hoga ki agar aapako us pustak ke bare main koi aapatti he to aap us par duusari pustak likhiye
 Facts and its interpretation should be faced
 He said, "if you do not agree, write another book or say that i do not agree with your conclusion
" aise main kisi ko koi aapatti nahin hogi lekin kitaab par pratibandh lagaana yaa jalaana? kitaab ko jalaana?’’ jaswant ne kaha ki hamamen tathyon or uski vyakhya kaa saamana karne kaa saahas hona chahie bhale hi ham usase kitne hi asahmat kyon na hon
 In this context, he gave the example of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and said that when Shiv Sainiks were opposing James Lan's book on Shivaji, he said that the answer to the book is another book
 jaswant ne kaha ki janata ko yah sawaal poochne kii jarurat he ki jab vah mahaj ‘‘hamaare itihaas’’ kii vyakhya kar rahe the to usamen adaalat ko hastkshep kyon karnaa padaa

 In this episode, CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury has said that the announcement of giving 500 rupees every month to the farmers in the interim budget shows that the government itself is not aware of the crisis of the villages and farmers born by the government
 yechuri ne bajet par pratikriya dete hue kaha, ‘agar kisi kisaan parivaar main paanch sadsy hai to is ghoshana ke tahat har sadsy ko teen rupee pratidin milegaa
 This is a proof of how far the Modi government is from the rural crisis

 com / i0xg74kii4— Tennis TV (@tennistv)may 11, 2018 Tanushree Dutta and Nana Patekar's dispute is constantly being reported from both sides
 naanaa netanushrike aaropon par khulkar baat kii he
 He said that he would answer all the questions through a press conference
 naanaa patekar ne bombai times se baatcheet main kaha ''abhi main jaisalmer main shooting kar rahaa hum
 As soon as i reach Mumbai on 7 or 8 October, i will do a press conference
 main camere ke saamne har sawaal kaa jawaab dena chahta hum
 Feel free to ask me anything
 mere paas chhipaane kii koi vajah nahin he
 Nana continued, "it's up to you what you want to trust
" kya aapako lagata he ki main itnaa ganda insaan hum? kya log mere bare main kuch bhi nahin jaanate
 i do not need to prove my good character
 main filmon main zyada dance nahin karata, to main kisi se kuch bhi ashleel step ke liye kyon kahuunga
 In such a situation, i can either deny all these allegations and say that she (tanushree) is lying or i can drag her to court to spoil my image
 iske alaava main kar bhi kya saktaa hum? lekin main waapas aakar sari baaten karuunga
 Hopefully people will not reach any conclusion before that
 ''naanaa patekar isse pehle bole chuke hai, "unka (tanushri) sexual herracement se kya matlab he? vahaan par 50 se 100 log set par mere saath the
 i see what i can do legally
 "kya he puraa maamla?tanushri ne naanaa patekar par shooting ke dauraan budtamiji or chhedchhad kaa aarope lagaaya he
 He accused Nana of trying to force himself with him during the shooting of a film in 2008
 unhone kaha tha, ''naanaa patekar jabaran kareeb aana chaahate the, ve shooting ke dauraan gane kaa hissaa nahin the, baavjood unhone unke saath intimet hone kii koshish kii
 The kind of accusations that Nana Patekar has made against the word servants, has sparked a new debate in Bollywood
 tamaam celebs ne tanushri kii himmat kii prashansa kii he
 Twinkle Khanna and Priyanka Chopane described Tanushree's move as courageous
 lekin tanushri ne donon hi actress ke saport par sawaal uthaa die
 Priyanka wrote on Twitter, "the world should trust the Survivors
 lekin priyanka kaa sarwairs kahana tanushri ko pasand nahin aayaa
 He said during an interview, "it is a good thing to do all these times, but i want to tell people that i am not a Survivor, but i have a name, i have a story
 ek aisa sach he, jise main baahar laane kii koshish kar rahi hum, ye sirf mere liye nahin he, balki unke liye he jo nai janareshan ke rup main aage aane vaale hai
 " intervyuu dene kaa sahi tarika bhi aapako ek badhiya naukari dilaa saktaa he
 Rachel Bite, Chief People Officer at a recruiting software company, has said that she often makes two such mistakes while giving a candidate interview, which causes her to lose her job
 bataa den, vah appal or intuit main recruiter or echaar agjicutive rah chukin hai
 Where he interviewed more than 6,000 people
 jaane kya he wo galtiyannermi se pesh naa anarechal bite ne kahaan ki intervyuu ke dauraan candidet kaa bihaviour naram nahin hota
 He said that after the phone interview, a candidate was called to the breakfast for the second round
 lekin jis tarah usne hotel ke staff ke saath bihev kiya usase saaf pataa chal gaya ki vah insaan kaisaa he
 He says that whenever a candidate comes to give an interview, he should be gentle
 aapke bure bartaav senaukarito nahin milegi saath hi aapke image par bhi sawaal khadey ho sakate hai
 Know what those mistakes are
 
 
 
 Do not ask questions, they said that you are going to interview for a job in a new company, and if you do not ask any questions related to the company, then it also has an incorrect impression
 recruiter ko lagata he ki aap naukari ko lekar syrius nahin he or nai company ke bare main kuch nahin jaanate
 He says that the candidate in the company who is going to give interview, do research about it
 taaki aap recruiter se company se sambandhit sawaal- jawaab kar saken
 One thing to always keep in mind that whenever you ask an awkward and logical question, no one will consider you stupid

 i have not seen it
 " bombai times ko die is jawaab ne salmaan khan ke phens ke saath hi anya logon ko bhi kaaphi hairaan kar diya
 It is believed that Salman Khan did not pay attention to this meme due to being busy in the promotion of his upcoming film 'bharat' (bharat) or it may be that Bhaijaan is not saying anything on this meme
 bataa den ki film 'piem narendra modi' (PM Narendra Modi) main 'narendra modi' kaa kirdaar nibhaa chuke vivek oberoi (vivek Oberoi) ne aishwarya raay (aishwarya Rai), salmaan khan (salman Khan), abhishek bachchan (abhishek Bachchan), aradhya bachchan (aradhya Bachchan) or khud kii photo kaa prayog karke opinian pole, agsit pole or nattejey par ek mim share kiya tha

 Sharma told PTI, 'A lot depends on the circumstances, but the news coming from there seems to be a very good season for fast bowlers

 This bill has been passed by the Modi government, but now it is being opposed all over the country
 bill paas hone ke baad jo hinsak virodh pradarshan purvottar ke rajyon main shuru hua tha, ab vah desh kii rajdhani dilli tak pahunch gaya he
 While the states of the northeast are concerned about their identity, other states of the country are calling this law as non-constitutional
 purvottar main kyon ho rahaa he bill kaa virodh?nae naagarikta kanoon ke tahatbangladesh, afghanistan, pakistan se aae hindu-jain-buddha-isai-parsi-sikh sharnaarthiyon ko bharat kii naagariktamilnaa aasaan hoga, lekin purvottar ke rajya iskaa virodh kar rahe hai
 In fact, many states of the Northeast say that a large number of people of this community are still staying in their state or area, if they get citizenship now then they will be permanent
 purvottar ke sanghathanon kaa kahana he ki agar adhiktar bahriyon ko vahaan kii naagarikta milti he, to sthaneey asmita, bhashaa, culture, logon par iskaa bura asar hoga
 Most of this is being opposed in Assam
 haalanki, ye bhi bataa den ki purvottar ke kuch kshetron / rajyon ko centre sarkaar ne inner line permit main rakhaa he, jiske kaaran ye kanoon vahaan par lagu nahin hota he
 These include some areas of Manipur, Arunachal, Meghalaya
 purvottar main kai chaatr sanghathan is bill ke khilaaf sadakon par utre hue hai or centre sarkaar se is kanoon ko waapas lene kii apil kar rahe hai
 What is the issue in other states? This law is also being opposed in most of the regions of the country because this law is being violated by Article 14 of the Constitution
 sanghathanon kaa tark he ki ye bill samvidhan ke artical 14 ke samanta ke adhikaar kaa ulanghan karata he, yahi ek virodh kaa asal kaaran he
 Along with this, the logic is that this law violates the basic ideas of India i

 After finishing work one day when i was going back home on my bike, i saw Sunanda at the bus stop
 unhone nile rang kii genes or pili shart pahan rakhi thi
 i stopped looking at them, but before i asked them anything, they came back saying that they like the bike very much
 uske baad ve kehane lageen ki unhen shikare par ghoomane main bada majaa aata he
 What was there again, we left
 duubate suraj kii sunahari rangath main nahaai dal jhil main ham shikare par baithe the
 She might have learned a lot about me because she requested me to sing
 maine gaanaa sunaaya
 Fija smiled in love
 jald hi hamen mahasoos hua ki yah sirf ek dostana pasandgi nahin, balki usase zyada gaharaa ehsaas he
 i started leaving from my house for office an hour before, so that i could take them with me from their uncle's house
 raste main rukkar airforce mess main coffee pinaa hamaara rojaanaa kaa niyam ho gaya tha
 Sunanda was very much like her father and was not so close to her mother
 ve ghanton apane bade bhai ke bare main baaten karatin
 His younger brother was like a son to him, which he really cared about
 jald hi, unhone apane pita se mujhe milwaaya or aise maukon par koi bhi ladkaa sawaalon ke rup main jaisi mixilon kaa saamana karata he, mujhe bhi karnaa padaa
 Meanwhile, she continued to smile while standing behind her father
 1985 main hamaari sagaai ho gai
 One day she said that she wants to do a fashion course in Delhi
 maine unhen hami bhar di
 We have come to Delhi
 unhone south ekstansion ke ek fishan institute main daakhila liya or course puraa kiya
 We got married one day after that
 vah sachmuch ek shandaar shaadi thi
 The journey of the train to the rural area of sopore, away from the bustling urban environment of Srinagar, was very attractive and the wedding ceremony was very beautiful
 sab taraf jaise khushiyaan hi khushiyaan bikhri thim
 We returned to Delhi
 jindagi apni gunguni raftaar se maje main guzar rahi thi
 But then destiny started to turn and time started changing our relationship
 ek aam jode kii tarah hamaare bich bhi matbhed panpane lage jo dhire-dhire badhate ja rahe the
 The separation was now decided
 shaadi hamane shaayad thodi jaldi kar lee thi, yaa yah bhi kah sakate hai ki uske liye ham abhi bahut chote the
 Whatever they are now they are a thing of the past
 ham kaise, kyon or kab alag hue, myne nahin rakhata
 The most important thing is that we both went ahead on our way
 main rishikesh main saath bitaayaa wo lamhaa kabhi nahin bhul saktaa
 At 10 pm, Sunanda insisted that she had to eat the baked split ice cream at the Oberoi Hotel in Delhi
 phir kya, ham car main baithe or dilli ke liye ravaanaa ho gaye, hotel pahunche, desert khaaya or waapas ho liye
 Such was Sunanda-emotion, beautiful, surprising and always in a hurry
 mujhe hameshaa mahasoos hota tha ki sunanda ke man kii door ko aakankshaon, shoharat kii chaah or glamer ke aakarshan ne baandh rakhaa he
 But they had also achieved all this
 baad ke dinon main kabhi-kabhaar achaanak yaa kisi saamaajik samaaroh main hamaari mulaakaat hoti rahi
 Even when the IPL controversy broke out, i knew that they would win and they won
 sujith (sunanda ke duusare pati) ke nidhan par mujhe bada dukh hua tha
 i thought of how she would handle herself even now she has a child
 lekin ve jujharu mahila thim or apane sadhe kadamon se unhone phir kamyaabi hasil kii
 i was very happy when he married Shashi Tharoor
 main unhen khushhaal jindagi bitaate hue dekhnaa chahta tha
 i remember the Sunanda i had met for the first time, whom all Pinky used to call home and i used to call them Soo
 ho saktaa he ki duniya aapako achche se nahin samaj pai, yaa shaayad aap apni jaldbaaji main duniya ko nahin samaj sakin, shaayad aap is duniya ke liye bani hi nahin thim
 "then there is a playful bird flying in the winds

 The Prime Minister said in his address at the National Defense University on Friday that destructive forces want to create an atmosphere of chaos, uncertainty and instability

 Ashraf's remarks have come in the wake of the recent increase in attacks by the Taliban and reports that the Pakistan Army has made a major reshuffle in its policy, calling the country's terrorist groups and insider threats as the biggest security threat

 On Monday, Finance Minister p Chidambaram, along with Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh, reached the Congress office to clarify the questions arising on this new direct cash transfer scheme
 yah nai yojana congress ke bhavi chunavi ranneeti kaa hissaa ho sakati he
 Jairam Ramesh indicated this when he said that Rajiv Gandhi used to say that 15 out of 100 money reaches the people
 ham jo kar rahe hai vah sirf nagad kaa nahin aapke haq kaa transfar he, 'aapkaa paisa aapke haath'
 This statement of Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh shows that the government is giving great importance to its cash transfer scheme in lieu of subsidy
 congress lag rahaa he garib bharat ko yah tohfa uske liye achche raajnneetik ritern laaegaa
 The scheme is being implemented in 51 districts of the country from January next year
 june se ise baaki desh main bhi le jaaya jayega jahaan aadhaar card ban chuke hai
 However, the government has currently implemented the subsidies in this scheme, which are easy to transfer and have less scope for disturbances
 inamen scolership or vidhwaa pension jaisi chizein hai
 Food and gas subsidy is not yet included
 kul 29 tarah kii sabsidiyaan hai jo agle do saal main 42 ho jaaengi
 The government is also focused on the fact that there is no scope for dishonesty and rift in this scheme
 haalanki enditivi india ne apni report main dikhaaya he ki kis tarah rajasthan main iske payalat project main gadabadiyaan hui hai

 enditivi ne jab jairam ramesh se is bare main poocha to unhone mana ki alvar main payalat project main khamiyaan saamne ai hai or unhen durust karne kii koshish kii jaaegi
 The comments naregaa ke baad yah duusari yojana he jo sarkaar ko sidhe garib logon se jod sakati he or yah ehsaas mantriyon ko he
 The government wants to stop the subsidy wastage under this new scheme
 zaruuratmandon tak sabsidi kaa phayda sidhe pahunchaana chaahati he
 However, if the flaws that have come up during the pilot projects in Alwar and elsewhere are not rectified in time, then it can prove to be a difficult challenge to implement properly across the country

 This new plan may be a part of the Congress's future electoral strategy

 sarkaar kaa dhyaan is baat par bhi he ki is yojana main beyimaani or daraar kii gunjaaish na rah jaae
 However, NDTV India has shown in its report how the pilot project in Rajasthan has gone wrong
 philhal sarkaar kah rahi he vah inhen bhi dur karegi
 When NDTV asked Jairam Ramesh about this, he admitted that the pilot project in Alwar had found flaws and would try to fix it

 The reason is clear
 rajani kii ye film karnataka main vivaad ke chalate relies nahin hui he
 Kaala is released in only 2000 theaters worldwide
 darasal, karnataka main kaveri jal mudde par rajnikant kii tippanee kaa virodh ho rahaa he
 In view of this, the release of the film has been postponed
 kaala: japan se film dekhne aa rahe darshak, saudi arab main bana ye recordbata den ki karnataka ucch nyaayalay dwaara film kii surakshit relies ke aadesh ke maddenjar kareeb 120 cinemagharon or multiplex main police kii tainaati kii gai he, lekin apriy ghatnaon se bachane ke liye subah or dopaher ke sho radd kar die gaye hai
 Chief Minister Kumaraswamy is himself a Kannada filmmaker and distributor but has appealed to the distributors not to release the film in the interest of the state and its people at present despite the court's intervention
 sutron kii maane to film relies se pehle hi 230 karod rupee kama chuki he

 Politics is often a game of memories and memories are usually idioms
 main jab kabhi dhoti ke bare main sochataa hum, to mere jehan main ek bedaag kapade kii aisi chhavi ubhartee he jo rojaanaa vaisaa hi jhak-safed bana rahata ho, jo apane sadepan main bhi bhavy ho
 Then suddenly my mind starts comparing between the unmatched plainness of the dhoti and the vast variety of sarees
 donon hi kala ke aise namoonay hai jinamein rosemara kii jindagi kaa aks dikhataa he
 The texture of both of them is like a poem, which is enough to grab the attention of a story
 mujhe yaad he ki mere chachaa chandrashekhar jo ek khagolbhautikeevid the, kaise chennai main baithe-baithe apane puraane presidency college main hokar aane ko betaab rahete the
 He did not want any special hospitality there
 ve to bas itnaa chaahate the ki presidency kii puraani imaarat main khud ko dubo len or puraane jamaane kii yaadon main khud ko bhigo len
 They just wanted to take pleasure in it by remaining ignorant
 unhone iske liye bilkul saaf-suthra nuskhaa apanaaya
 He used to wear one of his favorite dhoti, put on a light shirt and rode around the presidency in a leather sandal
 apane puraane college ke patan par unhen jitna dukh hota tha, vahaan maujuud rahakar ve utane hi khush bhi hote the
 No one knows that this man who is walking in the world is a great scientist
 mujhe yaad he ki bharat lautne ke baad unhone suut chhodkar veshti pahananaa shuru kar diya tha
 Dhoti felt like he was in the house, he seemed to have actually returned home
 unke liye dhoti kaa matlab jivan jeene kaa ek tarika tha, apane hone kii vah avasthaa jahaan unhen baar-baar lautakar aana tha
 Gandhi also wore a type of dhoti
 rosemara kii vah saamaanya dhoti samay ke saath unki raajnneeti kaa pratik hi ban gai
 Gandhi's simplicity made English imperialism synonymous with the power of excessive costumes
 kapadon main laden-fande maharaajaaon or angrej afasaron kii bagal main khadey shishtataa or sadepan se labarej gandhi ke bich kaa rajnatik fark saaf najar aata tha
 It was Gandhi's personality that united the dhoti and the body, against which imperialism, in its vulgar attire, seemed exaggerated
 is muhaavarey se itar yah baat bhi saaf thi ki dhoti kii shishtataa apane aap main bedaag thi, jiskaa ek-ek resha kapaas ke gunon kaa utkarsh bakhaan karata tha
 i remember when Gandhi met the Queen of Britain, she remarked in the chuhal that "the Queen is wearing so much that it is enough for both of us
" ” dhoti kaa isse behatar bachaav or kya ho saktaa tha!apane is tamaam rashtrawaad or samskruti prem ke baavjood mujhe club samskruti se koi parhez nahin he
 In my memory, the club comes as an Englishman, which used to be within all of us
 club jasusi kahaniyon kii kitaab jaisi koi rahasyamay kism kii jagah hoti thi, jahaan sharlaak homes jaise logon se milane kaa sukh miltaa tha
 The club was a unique place, but i have a strange image in my hair brain, where there was a confluence of different worlds
 klbon main praudh log ajibo-garib tareeke se bartaav karte the, jahaan aadmi brij khelte or auraten dhumrapaan karti thim
 It seemed that there should be a concession of encroachment from everyday life
 main bachapan main chips khate hue or ginger bear gatakate hue yah sab dekha karata tha
 The club was a place where you could be English
 mujhe yaad he ki apni kishoravastha main ham klbon ke baahar lage puraane jamaane ke nirdesh “kute or bhartiya kaa pravesh varjit” par thitholi karte or samrajyavad kii haar par hansate the
 i recognize that my thoughts about the club are r
 ke
 The great characters of Narayana were close to Swami, who had established the Madras Cricket Club and charged everyone four fees to enter it, which was a huge amount at that time
 baad main jab ham bade hue to hamane janaa ki club kaa ek matlab raajnneeti or satta bhi he, club vishisht vyaktiyon ke liye hote hai or inamen pravesh kaa maamla mandiron main pravesh jitna vivaadit rup bhi le saktaa he
 i remember that the great engineer Visvesvaraya founded the Centenary Club in Bangalore because he was barred from entering another club
 kuch dinon pehle main centenry club gaya tha, to maine dekha ki kaise vahaan ek ladke ko dwarpal isliye roak rahaa he kyonki vah kachche main aa gaya tha
 Even now, 'elite clothing' is the test of entry
 club kai maamalon main warcestershire sos, angreji naashte yaa skool kii ti jaise angreji dinon ke hangover hai
 But we Indians had our own fundamental technique of indigenizing English things
 ham ab bhi angreji naashte ko bachaae hue hai, lekin england main salbhar bitaane ke baad mujhe ehsaas hua ki hamaare omelette unase zyada swaadisht hote hai
 For Shakespeare and Woodhouse lovers, the collapse of the empire was a matter of deep concern
 club na hote to hamaare paas berty wooster naam kaa paatr nahin hota
 Murid scholar of Englishness Neerad c
 choudhary kaa kissa mujhe yaad he ki jab ve apane sapanom ke swarg britain pahunche to kaise unhone is baat kii shikaayat kii ki bartaani angreji kaa str gir gaya he
 He was very hurt due to English
 club bhale hi angreji samrajya kaa hissaa rahe hon, lekin ve hameshaa se aupniveshik khumaari kaa shikaar nahin the
 There were changes in them
 masalan, club kii choukhat paar karne ko hamane apni naitikta kaa paimaana bhi banaaya tha
 a strong example of the use of clubs is the Indian Army
 afasaron ke club main aap aachaar-vyavhaar, khaane kii mej ke taur-tareeke, style, paridhaan, sammaan or shahi andaaj ke nuskhe sikhte the
 There was a stereotype about entering and behaving, especially regarding clothes
 aise club jab aachaar samhita par jor dete to kisi ko koi aapatti nahin hoti
 i often think that India has been a hospitality-loving country where the last Englishman, or perhaps the last man of the Victorian era or even the last Marxist, has found a place in Indian clubs
 mujhe to khumaari pasand he, khaskar jab usamen angrejiyat ho
 i believe that we have cultivated the English rites, have created an Englishness which they could not even imagine
 aaj hamaare kai klbon ko aadhunik banaae jane or puraane ‘sahab-memsahab’ vaale ravaiyon se paar jane kii jarurat he
 Democracy has a way of dealing with the culture of clubs, although it would require an intuitive understanding and vigilance
 kai club pravesh ke niyamon ke maamle main kathor rahe hai or unhone inkaa istemaal logon ko baahar rakhane main kiya he
 In an emerging economy, club rules may have become irrelevant, but clubs should allow rules that fall within the scope of national law
 club satta kaa aks hai or poshaak satta kii bhashaa
 This power can create alienation and whenever it is done against human dignity, it has to be challenged
 duusare, badalte hue bharat main club choti-choti upsanskritiyon ke vaahak ban jate hai, aisi laghu jeevansheliyaan jinamein logon ko rahane kii chhot di jaani chahie
 There is an attachment to the old ways of living life
 us moh ko khatm karne kii koi jaldbaaji nahin honi chahie
 Now we come to the case of Madras Club
 hycourt ke ek jaj ko club main aane se isliye roak diya gaya kyonki ve dhoti pahane hue the
 This created a ruckus of meaninglessness, but with this we can definitely catch the signs of change
 rajnatik dal turant harakat main aa gaye or diemke ne kaha ki dhoti uskaa saanskrithik or rajnatik pratik he
 In the colonial black dress, lawyers demonstrated in front of the MCC
 mukhyamantri jayalalita harakat main ain or unhone kah diya ki poshaak ke maamle main anaavashyak niyamon vaale klbon kaa license roak diya jayega
 Now, at one level, populist politics is taking place, although at another level it is also an indication towards the club's expired rules
 yah sambhraant kapadon or bandishon ke bich ke fark ko dikhaata he
 Democracy has changed lifestyles and brought society in front of new people and new forces
 in badlaavon ke prati klbon ko sachet rahanaa hoga or vaazib pratikriya deni hogi
 For example, instead of fixing 'just western' attire, clubs can also define its definition as native
 dhoti or duusari kism kii puraani poshaakon ko chhot dekar club apni shishtataa main ijapha kar sakate hai
 Clubs came to us with modernity and they have to protect themselves by remaining part of modernity
 phir bhi, yah ummid to rahegi ki ye badlaav jarurat se zyada na hone paaen
 Diversity is as important as equality but both can exist in the same framework
 club badlaav kii is lahar ke vaahak ban sakate hai or saath hi us shandaar sanak ko bhi kuch had tak bachaae rakh sakate hai jisaki is loktantr ko jabardast jarurat he
 (shiva Vishwanathan is a social science scholar) samaajawaadee party se alag hue shivpal yadav ne apni siyaasi raah chun lee he
 Announcing to form a 'samajwadi Secular Front', he has decided to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 shivpal ke taal thokane ke baad ye saaf ho gaya he ki sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ko bijepi se muqabla karne ke saath-saath apane chachaa se bhi do-do haath karne honge
 Shivpal Yadav has announced to contest the Lok Sabha elections for the first time in his political life
 isse pehle soobe siyasat tak hi ve apane aapako simit rakh rahe the, lekin ab ve rashtriya raajnneeti main dastak dene ke liye kadam aage badhaayaa he
 Shivpal said that i am preparing to contest Lok Sabha elections for the first time, whether Mulayam Singh Yadav has to decide whether the candidates come against me
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki akhirshivpal kis sansadeeysit se taal thokenge
 The strongest strongholds of the SP are Etawah, Mainpuri, Kannauj, Firozabad, Sambhal and Badaun
 inhen kshetra main mulaayam kunbe kaa kabja he
 Etawah Lok Sabha seat is reserved for Scheduled Castes
 is tarah itawa se unke ladane kaa koi auchity hi nahin he
 Mainpuri parliamentary seat has been the traditional seat of Mulayam Singh Yadav
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mulaayam singh yadav mainpuri or azamgarh do siton se maidan main utre the or donon jagah jeet hasil kii thi
 Later, he left Mainpuri seat, after which grandson Tej Pratap Yadav won this seat and reached Parliament
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mulaayam singh yadav ne azamgarh ke bajaay mainpuri se ladane kaa elaan kiya he
 In such a situation, it is impossible to contest against Mulayam Singh from Shivpal Mainpuri
 firozabad seat sapa kii majboot siton main se ek he
 At present, Akshay Yadav, son of SP National General Secretary Ram Gopal Yadav, is a Member of Parliament
 sapa ke liye bahut majboot seat nahin maani jaati he
 Akhilesh won this seat in 2009, but later resigned
 iske baad hue upachunaav main dimple yadav utari, lekin upachunaav main dimple yadav utari, par congress ke rajbabbar se haar gayi
 Ram Gopal and Shivpal's feud is well known, but it is difficult to get elections from Firozabad
 badaayun loksabhaa seat se dharmendra yadav saansad hai
 It is believed that this time too, he will take the field from Badaun
 dharmendra ke rishte shivpal se thik thaak hai
 In such a situation, they are very unlikely to fight this seat
 kannauj se sapa adhyakikhilesh yadavaki patni dimple yadav saansad hai
 It is believed that Dimple Yadav will not contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main dimple yadav ko is seat par jeetne main lohe ke chane chabane pad gaye the
 From this seat, Akhilesh became MP by winning the Lok Sabha elections thrice
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki akhilesh yadav 2019 main is seat se utar sakate hai
 However, they have not announced it yet
 aise main shivpal yadav is seat par apni daavedaari kar sakate hai
 Sambhal seat has been considered as one of the strongest seats of the SP in one round
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi is seat ko jeetne main safal rahi he
 Ram Gopal Yadav may once again contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 in dinon sanbhal main aana janaa unhone shuru kar diya he
 This seat has been such that Mulayam Singh became MP from here twice
 iske baad ramgopal yadav 2004 ke loksabhaa jite
 Now he is expected to land once again
 sapa ke garh main mulaayam kunbe kaa kabja hone se in siton par shivpal yadav ke liye koi spesh nahin najar aa rahe he
 In such a situation, they have only one seat left
 wo he eta loksabhaa seat, jahaan se shivpal apni kismat aajamaa sakate hai
 At present, this seat is occupied by BJP
 yahaan se kalyaan singh ke bete rajvir singh saansad hai, lekin unke khilaaf maahaul najar aa rahaa he
 In such a situation, BJP can field him from Aligarh this time
 aise main shivpal ke chunaav ladane kii sabase zyada sambhaavna eta se he
 Etawah Lok Sabha seat is considered to be very favorable for Shivpal
 is seat par yadav or obisi matadaataaon kii sankhya acchhee khaasi he
 As a result of this, SP had managed to win this seat in 1999 and 2004
 aise main shivpal is seat se apni kismat aajamaa sakate hai
 Shivpal has started his political journey by holding the finger of his elder brother Mulayam Singh Yadav
 unhone pehla chunaav jila sahakaari bank kaa ladaa
 In 1993, he was elected President of District Cooperative Bank, Etawah
 1995 se lekar 1996 tak itawa ke jila panchayat adhyaksh bhi rahe
 Meanwhile, in the interval of 1994 to 1998, Uttar Pradesh Cooperative Village Development Bank also took over as the chairman
 iske baad jaswantnagar se vidhansabha kaa chunaav lade or aitihaasik maton se jite
 After this, he was a minister in Mulayam government to Akhilesh government
 2007 se 2012 tak vipaksh ke netaa kaa pad bhi sambhala

 unka kahana he ki jabatak signechar brij banakar yatayaat ke liye khol nahin diya jaataa tab tak wazirabad pul ko band na kiya jaae, nahin to puri uttar purvi dilli main jabardast trephic jam lag jayega

 ' The Government of West Bengal is adopting the British 'divide and rule' strategy to break the Gorkhaland movement
 is andolan ke kaaran rajya ke teen pahari jile dargiling, kalimpong or kursinyang pichley teen maheene se hinsagrast hai
 Last week, Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) president Bimal Gurung, who had called for an indefinite strike on 9 June to protest against the attempt to impose Bengali language in schools, and until recently GJM chief convenor Binay Tamang were close associates
 ve gorkhaland ke liye saath dharne par baithe or reliyaan kii thim
 But now they are enemies of each other
 gurung kaa aarope he ki tamang unki gaddi par kabja karnaa chaahate hai jabaki tamang kehete hai ki gurung unhen jaan se maarna chaahate hai
 The state government's role is behind this rivalry of both
 sarkaar vahi kar rahi he jo usne 2007 main kiya tha jab gorkha neshnal libration front (jienelef) se nikle or uske pramukh subhash ghising ke chahete rahe gurung ne alag hokar jijeem bana liya
 Now, after ten years, Tamang is leaving his partner Gurung
 tamang ko andolan kaa zyada 'udaar cheharaa' mana jaataa he
 Gurung has been missing since he was booked under the Unlawful Activities (prevention) Act (UAPA) on August 20 after a grenade blast at Kalimpong police station and the look out notice was issued (they are probably in Sikkim)
 29 agast ko rajya sarkaar ne tamang or unke samarthak anil thapa ko ek meeting ke liye bulaayaa, jiske baad unhone hadtaal 12 din ke liye sthagit kar di
 After this, GJM removed Tamang from the post of Chief Convenor by calling him a 'traitor'
 jijeem ke bade netaa roshan giri jin par yuapie ke tahat cese darj he or ve khud bhi gaayab hai, kehete hai, ''hamaare ek saathi ne dikhaa diya he ki kis tarah ve vaastavik baithak se pehle hi rajya sarkaar ke afasaron or mantriyon ke saath meljol badha rahe the
 Gurung and his supporters believe that Tamang's postponement of the strike will undermine the movement's goal
 duusari taraf gurung kaa kahana he ki rajya sarkaar ko gorkhaland ke liye agar majaboor karnaa he to hadtaal hi ekmaatr rasta he
 "the government has won half the battle by registering a case under UAPA against Gurung and his close friends," says a senior official of the state home and hill affairs department
 gurung ab kabhi bhi saamne aakar samarthakon ko andolit nahin kar paaenge
 "that's why Tamang is challenging them to come forward
" abhi kuch din pehle darjeeling or aasapaas ke ilaakon main tamang ke putale jalaae gaye the
 Now the Tamang faction with the support of TMC is holding peace rallies
 ek adhikari kehete hai, ''tamang agar apni takat kaa pradarshan karne main safal rahete hai to sanket saaf he ki ek nae netaa kaa udai ho rahaa he
 "it will not take long for Gurung supporters to change sides

 supreme court ne hoicourt or nichali adaalat ke faisle ko palat diya
 The Supreme Court ruled that neither the direct evidence nor the witnesses identified them against them being involved in the riots
 lihaaza inhen bari kiya jaae

 22 saal baad dilli hoicourt kaa bada faisla aayaa tha
 The trial court had in 1996 sentenced him to five years in prison

 He was charged with violence in violation of curfew on 2 November 1984
 us hinsa main trilokapuri main kareeb 95 logon kii maut ho gai thi or kareeb sau gharon ko jala diya gaya tha
 These people petitioned the High Court against the trial court's decision and then the High Court's decision was challenged in the Supreme Court

 Indian cricket team off-spinner Harbhajan Singh on Saturday hit out at former Australian cricketer Matthew Hayden, saying that Hayden was resorting to cheap popularity to sell his book
 heden ne apni aatmakatha main likhaa he ki harbhajan or bhartiya team ke purv captain saurav ganguli ne 2004 main nagpur main khele gaye test match ke dauraan ghasyukt wicket dekhne ke baad khilne se inkaar kar diya tha
 Harbhajan said that there is absolutely no truth in Hayden's talk and that he is talking nonsense to sell his book
 bhajji ne kaha, "australia ke khilaaf meraa ricard dekhakar kya aapako lagata he ki mujhe is team se darane kii jarurat he
 i have proved myself against them again and again
 main 93 test maichon se yah sabit karata aayaa hum ki mujhe halaat se dar nahin lagata
 Haydn, to my mind, has mentioned the useless thing to sell his book
 " heden ne apni aatmakatha 'standing maai ground' main likhaa he, "ganguli or harbhajan ne match se kuch din pehle hi pich dekh lee thi
 Both were looking at the pitch as the farmer glanced at his field after the storm
 hamane andaja laga liya tha ki donon main se koi bhi test match main nahin khelegaa
 The same happened after all

 Foggy sky berang, benur or udhaas
 No birds were flying
 koi patang nahin dol rahi thi, na hi badalon ke rang asankhya murtiyan banaate hue aa-ja rahe the
 There was no trace of the presence of stars in the night
 tehre hue samudr yaa canvas par mrit padaa
 a faded picture
 na hawa ke bahane kaa koi shor, na aasmaan ke saans lene kii koi aahat, na hi suryoday se pehle ushaa kii chunari kaa champai alok, na hi chaand ke aane-jane se pehle kaa feekaa-sa ujaas, na hi aasmaan kii chaati main suraakh karke jhulata koi deodaar, na hi pahaad kii tikhi nok main chamakati barf kii koi parat, na hi barf kii aahon kaa ghut-ghuta dhuaan, na hi surya kii kirnon ke chubhane se si-si karti dharti kaa swar
 On this sky, a huge sea ship was unable to know how to balance
 nishchal, atal, adol silpatthar-sa, isi fike badrang aasmaan ke ek hisse kii tarah
 There was no one on the deck of the ship, nor any floor waving from the saddle of a window, nor any face, nor noise, nor smoke bending the sea from the railing
 sabhi kuch tehra hua, udhaas, bhayakrant
 Everybody's breath has stopped like a terrible fear but has not allowed to die
 aisa hi to tha wo aasmaan
 a charpoy or throne, standing close to this ship, stood without support
 pataa nahin kisi ne uthaaya hua tha yaa nahin, par isi par main leti hui thi
 Like a part of the plaintiff of death, a quivering groan for the hope of living in a wide sky

 puure maahaul kaa gauge lete hue wo kuch soch rahe-se lagate the
 Suddenly their silence was broken, they turned their eyes towards me and said - Dad, this is heaven
 phir maahaul kii chuppi ko pite hue bole -kitni shaanti he yahan
 i was sitting as if full
 unki baat puri hote-na-hote maine kaha- mujhe yah shaanti nahin chahie
 i do not want this dead paradise
 unhone kaha- yahan bada sukh he
 i immediately said - no, i do not want this happiness
 mere swar main uddandata thi
 i said mutually - i will go to Earth, this is not a good place
 wo udhaas ho gayi
 i started waiting, now what will i say
 achaanak wo puraa parivesh upar uthaa, jaise kisi ne tote kaa pinjraa upar uthaa liya ho
 There was another sky above
 berang, benur
 No darkness nor light ajeeb udaasi bharaa
 The color is like the color after death
 na kisi gaurayya ke peeche daudta uskaa joda, na rang badalte drishy, na hi ‘pi kahan- pi-kahan' kii rat lagaakar udata koi papiha, na hi aam manjariyon main ras gholti koi koyal, na hi sharaarat karke bhaagta koi bhramar
 The whole sky was spread like a widow's sheet
 bedaag aasmaan, jaise sab kuch khokar lutaa-pita-sa baitha ho
 The whole environment was halted again
 darshanik meri udandta se aahat the
 Yet he spoke once like the last heel
 -padma ji, ye baikunth he
 Who does not wish for it yahan vishnu kaa nivas
 
 
 i thought, which Vishnu has invited me by invitation? apane badppan or meri manushya hone kii majaburi kaa phayda uthaa rahe hai
 i will yearnly bid - even if it is Baikuntha, i have no desire for it
 bada andhera he yahan koi chiraag jalaanevaala dikhaai nahin detaa
 No wavy dupatta dries on this colorless sky
 yahan na suraj he, na chaand, ye kaisaa baikunth he
 It is very dark
 aap to prithvi se hokar aaye hai
 Don't you know what on earth is main man-hi-man jaanati thi- yahi ek lamhaa he, agar main udand na hui to mahaan darshanik jeet jaayenge
 Then how will i see the earth? - main yahan nahin rahoongi
 Lakhs of crores of hands on earth burn many lamps to bring glow to the face in the sad veela of the evening
 aap to prithvi par rahakar aaye hai
 Have you ever seen Diwali on Earth? maine unki aankhon main bheetar tak jhaankate hue kaha agar dekhi hoti to diye kii oot main sundari bahu ke chamakate mukhade kii tikhi naak par damakati kaudati laung aapako yaad hoti
 Where Lakshmi bows before Lakshmi, she is my earth
 vahaan surya he, chaand he, chaand- jaise sundar mukhade hai, un mukhadon par kurbaan hote aashiq hai, inhen aashiquon ne bijli banaakar puri prithvi ko ujaale kii dulhin kii tarah sajaa diya he
 No, i will not stay here
 main prithvi par jaaongi

 isaki shuruyaat pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bhaashan se hui, jo khud pehali baar chunakar loksabhaa pahunche hai
 Sources are quoting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his speech said that all mps should keep in touch with each other and everyone must have each other's mobile numbers
 pradhanmantri ne yah bhi kaha ki saansad apane aachaar, vichaar or vyavhaar kaa dhyaan rakhen
 According to sources, the PM said that mps and party leaders will have to focus on their work, away from statements
 piem ne kaha, main bhi pehali baar jeeta hum, main bhi nayaa hum, mujhe bhi apane seniors se siikhnaa he
 
 
 You too take advantage of their experience, brother-nepotism and corruption is the most serious problem, everyone has to stay away from it

 It said that the Prime Minister told the mps that as Members of Parliament we should all do our work seriously
 yaad rakhen, log aapke kaam ko sadan ke andar hi nahin, balki baahar bhi dekh rahe hai
 Our going from opposition to power is not just a few steps, it is a very important change and we should get out of the mindset of the opposition
 ham ek parivaar kii tarah hai or ham sabhi ek lakshya ke liye kaam kar rahe hai
 Try to make new friends, learn from each other and work in a spirit of mutual support

 Modi also asked mps to prepare every topic in detail and only then speak on it
 pradhanmantri modi ne ye bhi kaha tha ki saansadon ko 'raashtra ke naam sandesh' dene se bachanaa chahie
 It was believed that his point was that mps should refrain from speaking in the media on every subject and should only speak on the topics they understand
 party ke anya varisht netaaon ne saansadon se kaha tha ki kisi bhi kaagaj par dastakhat karne se pehle use thik se padhein
 Do not rent servants quarters and take care in meeting unknown persons
 ravivaar shaam chaar baje party ke varishthatam netaa laalkrishna adwani ke maargdarshan ke saath yah paathshaala samaapt ho jaaegi

 People are very disappointed with this performance of Kohli

 In this match, Virat Kohli scored just 1 run in 13 balls

 If # Kohli can't win # IPL also then how can he win # worldcup2019? He is a biggest drama abuser player in India
 Let me tell you that the captain of the Indian team may not have made three World Cup semi-finals but his name has many records
