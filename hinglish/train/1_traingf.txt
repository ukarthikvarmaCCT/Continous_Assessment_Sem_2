 a half-century from Parthil Patel and Virat Kohli, and a 103-run partnership between the two, led India to a strong score in the first ODI against England due to rain, despite their initial success in bowling

 27 runs for 2 wickets in 2 overs when the rain came and then the game could not resume
 bich main 32 over main 224 ran or 20 over main 164 ran ke lakshya ke saath match dobaaraa shuru karne kii koshish kii gai lekin lagaataar barish hone ke kaaran aisa sambhav nahin ho sakaa
 Both of these goals were probably in India's favor
 donon tiimon ke bich doosraa vanade ab chah sitambar ko southampton main khelaa jayega
 India, who were denied the victory so far on the current tour, suffered a setback before the start of the match when star batsman Sachin Tendulkar was ruled out of the match due to his chronic toe injury
 bhartiya pari ke 38wein over main rohit sharma kii anguli main bhi stuart broad kii gend lagane se fracture ho gaya or vah ab shrinkhalaa main nahin khel paaenge
 England got off to a poor start to chase the target
 captain or salaami ballebaaj elistare cook (04) ne praveen kumaar kii gend ko viketon par khelkar pavilion laute
 Praveen also dismissed another opener Craig Kieswetter (06) in his fourth and seventh over of the innings to take England's score to 21 for two
 iske kuch hi der baad barish aane lagi or match bich main hi rokna padaa jo dobaaraa shuru nahin ho sakaa
 At this time Jonathan Trott was playing 14 and Ian Bell two runs
 parthiv or rahane ko shuru main move hoti gend ke saamne dikkatein pesh ai
 Parthiv was lucky when Ben Stokes gave up his extremely easy catch at backward point off Tim Bresnan on a personal score of seven
 donon salaami ballebaajon ne pehle 10 over main 43 ran jode lekin england ke gendbaajon ko safalataa se maharoom rakhaa
 With the half-century of Parthiv Patel and Virat Kohli and a century partnership between the two, India scored 274 for seven in the first ODI of the five-match series against England here
 parthiv ne 95 ran kii pari khilne ke alaava kohli (55) ke saath tisare wicket ke liye 103 jabaki vanade cricket main padaarpan kar rahe ajinkya rahane (40) ke saath pehle wicket ke liye 82 ran kii saajhedaari kii
 Suresh Raina (38) and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (33) added 60 runs in the nine overs for the fifth wicket to bring the team score closer to 275 runs
 maujuuda daure par ab tak jeet se maharoom rahe bharat ko match shuru hone se pehle hi jhatka laga jab star ballebaaj sachin tendulkar pair ke anguuthe kii apni puraani chot ke ubharne ke kaaran match se baahar ho gayi
 Parthiv and Rahane initially faced problems in front of the moving ball
 parthiv bhaagyashaalee rahe jab saat ran ke nijee score par tim bracenen kii gend par ben stokes ne becoward point par unka behad aasaan kaich chhod diya
 Both the openers added 43 runs in the first 10 overs but the England bowlers were denied success
 england ne 11wein over main gendbaaji power play liya to bhartiya ballebaajon ne is puraa phayda uthaaya or paanch over main 35 ran jutaye
 Rahane hit two fours in Stuart Broad's over while Parthiv hit two consecutive fours over James Anderson in the next over
 rahane jab acchhee lay main dikh rahe the tab broad ne unhen samit patel ke haathon kaich kara diya
 Rahane waved in the air trying to pull off Brad's ball and Samit had no mistake in catching a catch at fine leg
 is yuva ballebaaj ne 44 gend kii apni pari main chah chauke maare
 In the next over of Brad, Rahul Dravid (02) was also controversially dismissed
 maidani ampire billy doctrove ne wicket ke peeche kaich kii apil thukraa di thi lekin england ke raferal maangane par tivi ampire marice irasamas ne unhen wicketiper craig keesweater ke haathon kaich out diya
 During the replay, however, the hot spot technique did not confirm the ball touching the bat
 baad main haalanki snicometer main laga ki gend or balle ke bich sampark hua he lekin yah takanic raferal pranali kaa hissaa nahin he
 Parthiv then teamed up with Kohli to lead the team towards a strong score
 parthiv ne darnbek kii gend par chaukaa or phir third main par do ran ke saath 66 gend main apana ardhashatak puraa kiya
 He then played two consecutive pull shots off Bresnan's ball for four
 chaar ran batore
 Kohli also hit fours in the over of Dernbach and Jonathan Trott
 unhone broad kii gend ko bhi therdman par chaar ran ke liye bheja
 Parthiv, however, was on his way to his first century in international cricket when he was caught by the wicketkeeper in an attempt to hit a sharp ball off the off side of Anderson
 unhone 107 gend kaa saamana karte hue 12 chauke maare
 He became Anderson's 200th victim in ODI cricket
 rohit sharma (0) bhi agle over main ritred hart ho gayi jab broad kii gend unki tarjani anguli main lagi or unhen chotil hone ke kaaran waapas lautnaa padaa
 Kohli meanwhile touched the 50-run mark off 69 balls with a single off Anderson
 unhone samit par bhi chaukaa jadaa lekin baayen haath ke is spinner kii agali gend ko vah viketon par khel gayi
 He hit four fours in 73 balls

 While Baizatal was ablaze with the grandeur of this ceremony, there was silence on Tansen's tomb
 aayojan sthaan badalane ke peeche samskruti vibhaag kaa tark tha ki ees ne tansen kii majaar par aayojan kii anumati nahin di he, jabaki ees se jude ek sthaneey adhikari bataate hai ki is saal samskruti vibhaag ne majaar par samaaroh ke aayojan kii anumati maangi hi nahin thi, keval urs aayojan kii anumati lee gai thi
 According to the ASI officials, last year, during the Tansen concert, spikes were made in the tomb premises and garbage was spread everywhere
 yahi nahin majaar or makbare main lagaai gai liten taangi gai, jisase smarak ko nuksaan pahunchaa
 On this, ASI asked the Culture Department for an answer in this regard which the department has not given till date
 smarak ko nuksaan pahunchane kaa yah vivaad keval tansen kii majaar tak simit nahin rahaa
 After this, ASI has become conscious about the safety of every monument it preserves
 samskruti vibhaag ke sanchaalak shriram tiwari kehete hai, ''ees ne khajuraho ke nrity utsav se lekar mandu ke mahal, bhojpur or chanderi ke durg main hone vaale aayojanon par bhi aapattiyaan jataani shuru kar di hai
 The famous dance festival of Khajuraho takes place at a distance of 700 feet from the main temple of Kandaria Mahadev
 35 saal pehle tak yah utsav mandir ke bheetar hi hua karata tha, lekin ees ne isse mandir ko nuksaan pahunchane kii ashanka jataai thi, jiske baad yah aayojan mandir ke baahar hone laga
 But now ASI has objected to this and they have planted trees outside the temple where the stage is made
 ees adhikariyon ne is jagah lite lagane par aapatti jataai he or kaha he ki isse 1,000 saal puraane mandir ko nuksaan pahunch saktaa he
 Tiwari also believes that there should be no such loss to monuments, but at the same time they add that the lights are installed so that people see the temple well in the background
 ees kii isi tarah kii aapatti ke baad mandu ke jahaaj mahal ke paas hone vaala utsav isse baahar kiya jane laga he
 The ASI has also expressed reservations about organizing cultural events in the fort of Bhojpur
 ees, madhya pradesh cirkil ke up-adheekshak basant swarnakaar kehete hai ki sangrakshit smarakon par saanskrithik aayojan kiye ja sakate hai lekin iske liye kuch niyamon kaa paalan karnaa jaruri he
 He says, "the culture department has violated the rules many times
 '' swarnakaar ke mutabik, pichley saal ke sangeet samaaroh ke dauraan tansen kii majaar ko nuksaan pahunchaa tha, or jab is babat patr bhejkar vibhaag se jawaab maanga gaya to koi uttar nahin mila
 So ASI seized last year's security fund
 is baar vibhaag ne anumati hi nahin maangi or aayojan sthal baijatal kar diya
 "as long as the Culture Department does not fulfill the terms of the ASI, there will be objections," says Swarnakar Saaf
 aakhirkaar in smarakon ko phir se to nahin banaaya ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, events will be allowed only after considering all aspects
 ''philhal, bich kaa koi rasta nikalataa nahin dikhaai de rahaa he
 Both departments are committed to not harming protected monuments
 lekin dashakon se chale aa rahe saanskrithik samarohon kii rangath aayojan sthal badalane se kitni feeki pad jaaegi or us maukey ke maahaul par iskaa kitna asar padegaa, is ore kisi kaa dhyaan nahin ja rahaa he
 With the commencement of the budget session of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has once again activated Operation Lotus
 karnataka main congress-jedies sarkaar ke gathan ke baad gathbandhan ko asthir karne kii bijepi kii yah chauthi koshish he
 The center of this BJP campaign is being described as Renaissance Hotel in Mumbai
 is baar bijepi kaa daawa he ki uske saath jedies ke 3 vidhayakon samet kul 14 vidhayak hai
 It is being told that the operation of Operation Lotus Part-4 is in the hands of Maharashtra MLA Prasad Lad
 prasad laad maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ke kareebi maane jate hai
 However, the Congress has said that 7 mlas did not attend the session which started on Wednesday
 inamen se 4 baagi vidhayak hai
 The mlas who did not join after the whip was released by the Congress are Ramesh Jarkiholi (rebel), Mahesh k (rebel), Umesh Jadhav (rebel), b Nagendra (rebel)
 congress vidhayak anand singh par hamale ke maamle main aaropee vidhayak jeen ganesh faraar chal rahe hai
 While MLA Sudhakar n and BC Patil have taken permission of the party
 udhar bajet satr ke pehle din rajyapal ke abhibhaashan kaa bahishkaar karte hue purv mukhyamantri bies yeddiurappa ne kaha ki koi vikaas nahin hone vaala, cabinet main hi andruni kalah he lihaaja ham rajyapal ke abhibhaashan kaa bahishkaar kar rahe hai
 Right now we are not going to bring no confidence motion
 ham intjaar karenge or sthiti par najar rakhenge
 In the 224-member assembly of Karnataka, the congress-jds alliance has a total of 118 mlas, including the Speaker of the Assembly
 vahiin sabase bade dal ke taur par bijepi ke paas 104 vidhayak hai
 Earlier, the BJP had tried to destabilize the congress-jds coalition government after two independents withdrew support from the government
 jiske tahat bijepi se sabhi 104 vidhayak dilli ke sate gurugram aakar tike the
 While the legislators were upset with the alliance, they were told to contact the BJP in a hotel in Mumbai
 lekin bijepi kii yah koshish naakaam ho gai kyonki party jarurat ke mutabik vidhayakon ke istife kaa jugad nahin kar pai, jisase sarkaar ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav laayaa ja sake
 But now once the assembly session starts, BJP has stepped up its efforts
 bijepi kii koshish he ki gathbandhan ke zyada se zyada vidhayakon ko bajet satr main shaamil na hone par raji kiya jaae
 The BJP hopes that the atmosphere created by the resignation of some of these mlas will be followed by other mlas, which will make it easier to bring a no-confidence motion against the government
 sarkaar ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav laane kii sthiti khadi karne ke liye bijepi ko kul 13 vidhayakon ke istife kii jarurat hogi
 After the whip is issued, Congress legislators have two options to either stand with the party or lose their membership by disqualification
 or phir 'lotus' simbel par chunaav ladakar vidhansabha main aaen
 However, the last time the Congress issued a whip, most of the mlas were said to be in touch with the BJP
 They considered it appropriate to attend the party meeting

 Gehlot continued to create an imbalance, so that a group of supporters could be formed
 joshi ke jane se gahalot ko yah bharosa ho gaya ki party main vahi ek netaa hai
 Gehlot has seen how leaders like Girija Vyas failed despite getting every possible opportunity to move forward in the past
 chaar maheene pehle jaipur main congress kii samanvay samiti kii baithak main joshi ne kaha tha ki gopalgarh or bhopalgarh kii ghatnaon ke rup main kushasan ujagar hua he
 He wanted Gehlot to give a small but effective administration
 gahalot ne mantrimandal, bordon or nigamon kaa to vistaar kiya he, lekin ek darjan vibhaag aaj bhi apane paas rakhe hue hai
 Even when he chose non-political people, he preferred the older people of his group, who are known to have less than average sense, but they used to create stories of conspiracies and politics on trivial matters
 is expert
 yahi vajah he ki naaraaz kaaryakartaaon ko lekar congress ke saamne kaaphi mushkilen aa rahi hai

 itnaa hi nahin, jaipur metro ne puraane shahar kii dharoharon ko bachaane ke liye moti rakam chukaakar mumbai ke ek dharohar visheshgy kii sevaayen lee thim
 Nevertheless, the six temples that were removed, instead of giving their original design, were kept with the same temples
 virodh kii ek anya vajah yah he ki puja sthal keval aasthaa ke centre nahin hai
 They are associated with the economy for priests, owners and shopkeepers and the business is flourishing with the connivance of temple committees, leaders and officials
 mandiron ko giraae jane kaa virodh 'mandir bachaao dharohar samiti' ke tahat kiya ja rahaa he
 It has the full support of Hindu organizations associated with the BJP
 vahiin congress kaa kahana he ki sattadhari bijepi sarkaar apni khaal bachaane ke liye in sanghathanon kaa sahaara le rahi he
 There are two reasons behind these protests
 ek, isane lalit modi se jude hangaame ko kuch had tak kam karne main madad kii he or doosraa, hinduon ko yah sandesh dena ki bijepi ke sahyogi sanghathan hinduon kii aasthaa ke liye lard rahe hai
 The Sangh has sent pictures of the demolished temples to its Nagpur office
 anadhikrut mandir kaa mudda congress shashan main shuru hua tha, jab ashok gahalot mukchaymantri the
 At that time 27 temples were removed, but not a single unauthorized mosque was erected
 bijepi ke maujuuda shashan ke dauraan jin 73 dharmik sthalon ko hataaya gaya he, unamem 8 masjiden bhi hai
 Both governments started the work of removing the shrines after getting a Supreme Court order
 adalati aadesh ke baad gahalot sarkaar kii ore se karaae gaye ek surveykshan main pradesh main 58,000 anadhikrut dharmik sthalon kii pahchaan kii gai thi
 There are 900 religious places in Jaipur alone
 sarkari adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki jin dharmik sthalon ko hataaya ja rahaa he, unamem se 10 fisadi musalamaanon ke hai
 Thus, they are not showing this strictness only towards the religious places of Hindus
 prashasan ne pichley saal jin 73 dharmik sthalon ko hataaya tha, unamem se zyaadaatar mandir ring road ke project par padate the
 There was not much hue and cry last year, as those temples were in the outskirts and not too old
 bijepi kii chintaa kaa ek mukhya kaaran yah bhi he ki panchvati cirkil kaa mandir pradesh adhyaksh ashok paranami ke nirvachan kshetra main he
 Apart from this, what will happen if the High Court starts asking for the report that what steps have been taken at the remaining 56,000 unauthorized religious places in the state? a senior official says, "how can we say that we will not follow the court's order?" At the same time, disgruntled leaders who have not been made ministers are also supporting these protests
 paranami kehete hai, ''yah mudda kaaphi samay se garma rahaa tha, par ab yah gambhir ho gaya he
 However, the current opposition to the Sangh is certainly a regressive move and with the support of the court, CM Vasundhara Raje will be able to face it
 sangh bhale hi unhen adaalat ke aadesh kaa counter karne ke liye kuch sanshodhan karne par majaboor kar saktaa he, par lambey daur main isse koi phayda nahin hoga
 The court will not allow unauthorized temples, mosques or churches to come in the way of the law obstructing the construction of roads
 sangh ko sochna hoga ki agar vah ring road or metro ke liye gharon-dukaanon ke giraae jane kaa virodh nahin karata to mandiron ko hataane par itnaa ho-hallaa kaise kar saktaa he? indian-american hotelier Vikram Chatwal, who was arrested with drugs at a Florida airport, has been released on a bond of 56 thousand dollars or about 31 lakh rupees

 com / zfjvjjmush bhartiya khaadya suraksha evam maanak praadhikaar (FSSAI) ne desh main megi noodles se pratibandh hataane se jude bombai hoicourt ke aadesh ke khilaaf aaj supreme court main yachika daayar kii
 The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India has termed the August 13 order of the High Court as 'flawed' and questioned the purity of samples given to the government approved laboratories for re-testing
 ethesaai ne daleel di he ki hoicourt ne kisi tatasth praadhikaar kii bajaay swiss company kii bhartiya ikai nestle ko hi nae namoonay uplabdh karaane ke liye kah kar 'bhul' kii he
 Earlier, the High Court quashed the orders of the Indian Food Safety and Standards Authority and the Food Controller of Maharashtra to ban nine varieties of Maggi Noodles in the country
 hoicourt ne kaha tha ki pratibandh lagaate samay naiysargik nyaay ke siddhant kaa paalan nahin kiya gaya, kyonki megi kaa utpaadan karne vaale paksh ko suna nahin gaya tha
 The comments ethesaai sutron ne kaha ki yachika main khaadya niamak ke adhikariyon ke khilaaf kii gai pratikul tippaniyon ko bhi hataane kii maang kii gai he
 It states that the authority should be allowed to examine samples in the laboratory under the relevant law and also not to insist on testing only in government recognized laboratories, which are very few in number
 hoicourt ne isse pehle ethesaai or maharashtra khaadya niamak epad ke aadesh ko nirast kar diya tha
 He banned nine varieties of Maggi noodles in the country
 hoicourt ne kaha ki noodles par roak lagaate samay naiysargik nyaay ke siddhant kaa paalan nahin kiya gaya, kyonki vinirmaataa ko uskaa paksh sunne kaa mauka nahin diya gaya
 The FSSAI has argued that the High Court has 'erred' by asking the Indian unit of the Swiss company to provide new samples instead of any neutral authority
 isse pehle, hoicourt ne desh main megi noodsl kii nau kismon par pratibandh lagane sambandhi bhartiya khaadya suraksha evam maanak praadhikaar or maharashtra ke khaadya niyantrak ke adeshon ko nirast kar diya tha
 The High Court held that the principle of natural justice was not followed while imposing the ban, as the party producing the magi was not heard
 tippaniyan FSSAI sources said that the petition also sought to remove adverse comments made against officials of the food regulator
 isamen kaha gaya he ki praadhikaar ko sambhddha kanoon ke tahat prayogshaala main namoonon kii jaanch kii ijaajat di jaay or saath hi keval sarkari manyata praapt prayogshaalaon main jaanch par jor nahin diya jo ki sankhya main bahut kam hai
 The High Court had earlier quashed the order of FSSAI and Maharashtra food regulator FDA
 inhone desh main megi noodles kii nau kismon par roak laga di thi
 The High Court held that the principle of natural justice was not followed while prohibiting the noodles, as the manufacturer was not given a chance to hear its stand
 ethesaai sutron ne kaha ki yachika main khaadya niamak ke adhikariyon ke khilaaf kii gai pratikul tippaniyon ko bhi hataane kii maang kii gai he
 It states that the authority should be allowed to examine samples in the laboratory under the relevant law and also not to insist on testing only in government recognized laboratories, which are very few in number

 How will Hindustan respond to Pulwama attack? In response, BJP spokesperson Sambit said that India will respond to Imran's speech in a circular manner and his statement reflects the sentiment of the Pakistan Army, terrorists and ISI, but the Prime Minister of India responds to the bullet with a bullet
 aatankiyon ko choda nahin jayega or vakt par jawaab diya jayega
 Our women too, heavy on your jawans, Pawan Kheda of Congress said that Imran Khan should first look at the history and geography of his country, when it comes to Pakistan and China, all political parties are standing together in unison
 pakistan ke mantri ke bayaan par congress ke netaa ne kaha ki hamaare desh kii mahilaayein jo chuudi pahenti hai, vah bhi pakistan ke sainikon se zyada majboot hai
 SP spokesman Ghanshyam Tiwari said that India will respond to this strongly, we are all standing with the Prime Minister and his answer will be the answer of this entire country

 raksha visheshgy ne kaha ki chunaav aaenge-jaaenge lekin abaki baar aar-paar kii ladaai honi chahie
 Sushil Pandit, who is fighting for the rights of Kashmiri Pandits, said that our sons are engaged in protecting the people and leaders of Kashmir but leaders like Mehbooba Mufti, Omar Abdullah did not reach Srinagar to offer a flower on the body of the jawans, whereas from Delhi Home Minister Rajnath Singh was giving shoulder to the body of the soldiers there
 susheel pandit ne kaha ki algaavvaadiyon par kathor karrwai honi chahie kyonki vahi ghati ke yuvaaon ko bhadakaane kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 When will Siddhu take action? Sambit Patra said that if the enemies of the country are around us, then those who shout anti-national slogans, protest the hanging of terrorist Afzal Guru, also need to be busted
 siddhu kaa naam liye bagaiyr sambit ne kaha ki kuch netaa pakistan ke piem ko apana yaar bataate hai or kehete hai ki aatankwaad kaa koi dharm or desh nahin hota
 Nothing will happen from the candle march, when will such leaders be expelled from the party
 siddhu par lage aaropon par congress ke pawan kheda ne kaha ki kis cricketer ne kya kaha, abhinayta ne kya kaha, hamen kab tak in baton main ulajhaayenge
 Enough of the government and the enemy of the country is not Sidhu or Kamal Haasan, but our enemy is General Bajwa
 desh kii senaaon ko ab jawaab dena dijie
 Union expert Avnijesh Awasthi said that the mockery of the martyrdom of the soldiers has been made earlier in JNU
 unhone siddhu ke bayaan par kaha ki yah kisi netaa kaa nijee bayaan nahin ho saktaa, aise bayaan dene waalon ko shame aani chahie
 SPEECH SPEAKER SPOKE Ghanshyam Tiwari said that the time of the speech is over now and action is expected from the government
 tiwari ne kaha ki desh ke dushman andar nahin baithe balki hamaara dushman padosi mulk he
 He said that the leaders of the country do not have the right to speech because none of us has made a sacrifice as big as the soldiers
 tiwari ne kaha ki desh kii raajnneeti main bahut saare matbhed hai lekin aaj unhen ukhaadne kaa vakt nahin he
 MS Bitta said that there was a long fight against terrorism in Punjab in which we responded to Pakistan
 padosi se do took kaha ki na khalistaan bana tha or na banane denge
 But we will have to escape from the traitors of the country because those people are really enemies of the country
 bitta ne kaha ki siddhu ne desh ke saath gaddari kii he or unhen pakistan ke piem imran ke ghar pakistan hi chale janaa chahie
 Pawan Kheda of the Congress said that the statement made by Sidhu has been given by Rajnath Singh in the Parliament of the country a few days ago

 mumbai kii baari barish ek baar phir se charchaa main he
 Rain in the city has affected life and traffic considerably
 aane vaale dinon halaat or bighad sakate hai
 Anyway, Mumbai has seen the terrible problems due to rain in 2005 and 2017
 aise main pani bhare sadakon main chalanaa kabhi-kabhi hamaari majaburi ban jaati he
 In such a situation, if you are walking by car and get stuck in the rain then keep these tips in mind
 exost main pani ko jaane se roke:jab bhi bhayankar barish kii sthiti main drive karen sabase pehle sadak par pani kii gaharaai ko bhaanp len, kyonki har car of-road car nahin hoti
 Walk slowly on water-laden roads and drive the car on first gear
 excilirator lagaataar den taaki pani exost main naa pahunche or ingine ko kharaab hone se bachaaya ja sake
 2
 car chhod den:agar barish thamane kaa naam naa le or pani kaa str badhata hi jaae to koi thik si jagah dekhakar apni car park kar den
 Filling water in the car can short circuit the electrical system, which can damage the entire security system
 ashanka ye bhi he ki takneekee khami kii vajah se car andar se bhi lock ho saktaa he, saath hi khidkiyaan bhi kaam karnaa band kar sakati hai
 It is better to leave the car in a safe place and leave
 3
 How to break the window: If your car stops working due to technical fault
 aise main sabase pehle car chhodkar nikalne kii koshish karen
 If the doors do not open and the windows are also closed, break the windows
 saavdhaanee ke taur par ek chota hathaudaa hameshaa car ke andar par rakhana chahie
 However, if there is no hammer, then the head rest can be used
 edjasteble head rest ko nikaala ja saktaa he or iskaa bottm khidki todane ke kaam aa saktaa he
 While breaking the window, keep in mind the distance
 4
 Drive slowly: Even if the situation is not like flood and it is raining slowly, visibility and traction can be reduced
 aise sthiti main gaadi dhire chalaanaa hi behatar rahegaa
 The possibility of aqua planning (slippery on wheels) in such rains increases
 5
 Keep the smartphone with you and avoid rumors: Don't get stuck in the car or stop the rain
 to aisi sthiti main sabase pehle apane smartphone ko surakshit rakhane kii koshish karen or bydaree ko bachaane ke liye data of karen yaa power seaving mod on kar den
 Avoid rumors found on whatsapp or any other platform and inform the situation to a family member first
 saath hi adhikariyon ko bhi kol karen

 On the loud voice of Dhanda, Chief Justice Deepak Mishra immediately said that there is no need to raise the voice here

 The daughter of an unemployed father
 Her eyes are always a desolate shrub in the warmth of the jetties and weeds like weeds are distraught deserted like a weeping land, and the sadness of the bushes on the face speaks loudly
 Looks far away
 The old school dress is muddy She not only protects the teachers and classmates but also keeps the eyes from her eyes
 The bag has lost its shine and color
 The stitches are stitched, the shoes are left standing in the foot
 They move among everyone
 It is forbidden to run and fall, so it can be ruined, it can be torn, the skirt can be torn and the shoe is the most different
 She opens and opens the old tiffin box Sometimes in the absence of the necessary solitude, she remains unmoved
 She is afraid of more people than hunger
 Often hears hearsay for not depositing fee Sensible parents do something and save her from getting swept away
 She sometimes asks for water from a girl sitting next to her
 Water is near her, even then the spasm is spilling over her face in such a way as to hide often In the affair, she hides herself in it
 In the life of the daughter of an unemployed father, there is nothing known about the ad hoc hackle, the present is so tragic that what will the future look like
 Sometimes she thinks that maybe her father will get some work and come to her house too, some money does not rain, otherwise it can be happy sometimes by thinking something like this, the daughter of unemployed father! -20152

 Sixty-three years was spent in managing oneself and thirty years in avoiding obligations
 In this way, sixty people have hardly ever lived, apart from man, even the youngest elephants cannot live to this age, the dogs will live barely ten to twelve years
 If you do not live, you have seen them working as soon as you get old by pulling the hull and you can stand on two legs pulling the reins of bull and weeding
 Stumpy horses appear in the trenches in a few days, and they do not see very much on the doors of men, old bulls who cannot get into the plow, and there are no horses who can not pull the cage
 i have seen very little of the oxen and horses dying
 And horses that are unable to bear the weight of a man go away, where they stop giving milk, those animals Area about much less do not meet the interests of Hanjinse man Hotilekin also about their Little do we know that people who live in milking and milking more and more live because the rest of the animals live least and whoever lives a long life has to be a turtle, only to become a scavenger, to create a world full of imagination and illusion and In the name of fighting, the world kept watching the world silently, even then, on the day of sixty days, Muktibodh, who did not even remember sixty i was able to live but had asked the question: 'what have you lived so far?

 When the chorus of hunger was alive, as soon as i felt hunger, i would go out in the world to fill my stomach and i would have reached a moment where the nature would have left me, but i am a man, but i do not know where my portion is eaten, i am a man, i am ill
 The life of my part is not fixed, without any rule, i am fighting the war of life, but the part of others i can eat food, but it is not possible to eat and save food without intelligence
 The journey of civilization that started from the struggle to fill the stomach has changed for some people, it is growing in the cruel lust of filling the house, the market of drugs of indigestion and the plots of the deprived
 i am getting less and less hungry, where do you go in such a hungry 'ramdas' who does not know how to ask and has lost all his life with teeth and hard doors In this city of barbaric buildings, the earth is growing like a flood and getting drowned in it

 jab wo phool jaae to use haath main malkar dhire-dhire chehre par lagaaein
 After this do face scrubbing in round motion

 Vinod Kumar Binny was the first of the leaders who rebelled from the Aam Aadmi Party
 binni ne aaj tak ko exclusive intervyuu diya he
 In this, Binny expressed his displeasure and also made many serious allegations against Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 binni ne kaha ki jin muddon ko lekar party bani thi, sarkaar banane ke baad un muddon par agar-magar kii sthiti aane lagi he
 Accusing Kejriwal, he said that i have never demanded a ministerial ticket or ticket for Lok Sabha elections, whereas if Kejriwal is saying this then he is lying
 do maheene timopas karnaa chaah rahe hai kejarivalbinni ne kaha ki aam aadmi party bhrashtachar ke mudde par bani thi
 The public was promised that the leaders involved in corruption would be taken to jail within six months of forming the government, but today after 20-22 days, no single leader has been booked
 aisa lagata he ki sarkaar do maheene timopas karnaa chaahati he, taaki loksabhaa chunaav se pehle aachaar samhita lagu hone ke baad vah kahen ki ab ham kya kar sakate hai
 Public issues have become more important, running the government, accusing Kejriwal of vandalism from the public, Binny said, 'today water is not reaching people's homes and the government talks about free water
 vaada 700 litre muft pani kaa tha, lekin aapane usamen kami kii
 Not only this, you are charging more than 700 expenses
 aisi koi baat tab yaa menifesto main nahin kahi gai
 It is a fraud with the public
 'binni ne kaha ki aisa lagata he ki arvind kejariwal kaa dhyaan ab janata ke muddon se hatakar sarkaar kaise chalaaya jaae is par kendrit ho gaya he
 This is the reason that the Congress against which the election was fought today is being run with the same government
 kejariwal ke paas baat karne ke liye samay nahinvinod kumaar binni ne kaha ki unki ladaai muddon ko lekar he or vah shuru se iske khilaaf aawaaj uthaate aae hai

 Even LG had his name in the initial list of five ministers
 vahiin, loksabhaa chunaav ke liye manachaahe seat se tikat nahin die jane ke kaaran baghawat kii baat par binni ne kaha ki unase loksabhaa ke liye nomination bharne ke liye khud arvind kejariwal ne kaha tha
 So, if he is now accusing me, then he is lying
 to somnath ke liye anshan karte kejarivalbinni ne arvind kejariwal par party main apane logon ke liye alag maapdand apnaane kaa bhi aarope lagaaya he
 He said that if the allegations were being leveled against Somnath Bharti, if he had been from some other party, Kejriwal would have done a sit-in protest for his resignation and not knowing what he was doing
 lekin apni party or apane logon ke naam par vah khamosh hai
 He said that the situation like this, Somnath Bharti should resign taking automatic cognizance

 He said, 'first everyone said that he will not take the bungalow, will not take the car, but now his words and actions have changed

 Had there been no uproar, he would have been living there

 The ED has arrested Khan under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) for transferring money to foreign banks
 idi ke nideshak raman gupta ne use sanyukt hiraasat ke liye piemele kii vishesh adaalat main jaj shivashankar ke saamne pesh kiya
 The SIT, formed by the Karnataka government in June to investigate the fraud case, has so far arrested 23 people including seven IMA directors

 Son-in-laws usually have some extra respect in our society
 use aap vishesh sthiti kah sakate hai
 But there is only one condition
 jis din damaad saalon (patni ke bhaaiyon) main aapasi ladaai karwaane lage, sasur ke dhur virdohi se pigen badhaane lage yaa patni ko torchar karne lage, uski vishesh sthiti usee kshan samaapt ho jaati he
 Although that son-in-law still remains
 kashmir (ghati) kaa darja usee damaad sareekha tha, balki parivaar ke bade damaad jaisaa, jo apane chote-chote saadhuon kaa bhi sammaan kha jaataa tha
 i will not go into that repeated story of how Maharaja Hari Singh or Sheikh demanded special status and how they merged with India or how many people have died in the valley at the hands of the army and terrorist
 bharat sarkaar ne haal hi main achaanak sansad main raashtrapati ke aadesh se jammu kashmir kaa vishesh darja chin liya, haalanki aahat sirf kashmir ghati he
 It is right that in 2019 this decision seems undemocratic - but it is also - in which 'consent' was not taken from the people of Jammu and Kashmir
 vaise jammu-kashmir se chunakar aae pachaas fisadi saansadon ne us vidheyak kaa sansad main samarthan kiya jiske hisaab se rajya main nai vyavastha behaal kii jane vaali he
 Accordingly, it is wrong to say that the opinion of the elected representatives of the state was not taken
 chune hue pratinidhi sirf vidhayak nahin hote yaa nagarpalika ke sadsy nahin hote
 Also, it is not completely correct to say that there was no discussion on it
 haa, is sansad main ise auchak laayaa gaya or kam samay charchaa hui lekin charchaa sirf sansad main nahin hoti
 a mainstream political party and its former incarnation had been opposing and discussing this article for the last seventy years and on which thousands of tons of paper had been dyed
 desh ke kaddavar netaaon ko ateet or vartmaan donon main is vyavastha se aapatti thi, jisamen se ek kii to usee ghati ke hriday samraat sher-e-kashmir ke shasankaal main jail main ‘mrityu’ tak ho gai
 The creator of the constitution was Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar, the pioneer of socialist politics
 ram manohar lohia samet kai netaaon ko anuchhed 370 par sanshay tha or kashmir maamalon main unki raay itar thi
 Many leaders said that this article is not a document of autonomy, love, engagement and goodwill, but immorality, slyness and rudeness
 is anuchhed par kai log jail gaye, hajaaron sabhaayen huin or hajaaron seminar hue or desh kii hajaaron deevaaren rangi gai
 This had been happening for seventy years
 lekin mukhyadhara kii kuch partiyaan or uske mitra buddhijivi us par chuppi saadhe rahe
 He pretended like an ostrich that the storm was not coming! Many things could be repeated here and there
 yahaan kul chaar baaten aisi hai jis par dhyaan diya janaa chahie:1
 Despite a lot of unethical and inhuman talk of special status, it was implemented, but after a few years in the reign of the country's first Prime Minister, sher-e-kashmir and the Chief Minister of the state were arrested and sent to jail at 12 in the night
 aisa kyon hua? kyonki kashmir ke us netaa ne vishwasghaat kiya tha
 The first deception was given by the same 'son-in-law' who was demanding special status
 jawaharlal nehru kii raajnneetik- aarthik adoordarshita kii tarif yaa aalochana ho sakati he lekin unki raajnneetik udaartaa kaa virodh unke dhur virdohi bhi nahin karte
 Sheikh Abdullah was his friend anyway
 phir nehru ne aisa kyon kiya? kyonki shaikh abdulla ne bharat main kashmir ke vilay ke baavjood america ke sahyog se use aaazaad banane kii yojana bana lee thi or sarkaar ke paas iske pukhta saboot the
 2
 kaayade se abdulla kaa yaheen krity anuchhed 370 ko khatm kar dene ke liye paryaapt tha
 But Nehru was generous and also passionate about his ancestral land
 duusari baat yah thi ki bharat ek navjaat loktantr tha jo us jamaane main anaaj se lekar jeep tak videsh se mangaata tha
 India was viewed with suspicion by both camps of the world and India was immersed in the Nirgut movement
 china-pakistan donon se tanatani shuru ho chuki thi
 In such a situation, the Indian government took another route
 usne anuchhed 370 main usee raste sanshodhano kii jhadi laga di jis raste use laayaa gaya tha
 By the time of Indira Gandhi, many of her thorns were removed
 3
 If the only obvious mistake of the Indian government was that it was rigged in the 1987 election
 farrukh abdulla ko mukhyamantri banane ke liye bharat sarkaar ne chunaavon main khuli dhaandhlee kii or adhikansh virdohi ummidavaaron kaa namakan hi radd karvaa diya
 It is the same Farooq Abdullah who is now calling for democracy
 uske baad kii kahani hamaari peedi ke har noujvaan ko lagbhag maaloom he or kashmir fate hue doodh jaisaa ho gaya jahaan saare tark, saare vivek, sari maanviyata khatm ho gai
 Here, one remembers Jayaprakash Narayan in which he had demanded to give full autonomy to Kashmir, but also said that the problem of Kashmir is not just a political or religious problem, but it is also geographical which has given him the history Has made a difficult turn
 kashmir agar vahaan na hokar urisa yaa chhattisgarh ke paas hota to yah koi samasya hi nahin thi jaise hyderabad yaa bhopal aazaadee ke baad koi samasya nahin rahe
 In such a situation, how much has been connected with the special situation of Kashmir in seventy years, it is a matter of research, yes the separation is clear and there is no need for research
 yahaan is aalekh main kisi dal kaa naam na lekar bharat sarkaar or vyaktiyon kaa zikr karnaa zyada uchit he, kyonki vah aranj marij ‘indian state’ or jammu-kashmir kii janata ke bich tha
 Sanjay Baru, who was the media adviser to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, writes that no state (state system) can exist unless it defines its geography and outskirts in its own way
 jammu- kashmir or khaskar kashmir ghati indian state kii sarhad or uske vajood ke liye chunauti ban chukaa tha jiske saboot kareeb aadha darjan pratyaksh yuddh or dashakon se chale aa rahe chhadam yuddh he
 The support of the latest change brought by some prominent Congress leaders in Kashmir is to support the same Indian state
 vyapak taur par ve bhaajapa kii tarafdaari nahin kar rahe yaa congress netritv kii avhelnaa nahin kar rahe
 In such a situation, we remember a story of the 1962 China War in which some American defense experts also came when the US announced symbolic support to India
 diwaar par tange vistrut nakshe par unhone ishaara kiya ki us ilaake se hokar tanks le jaaya jaae jo us samay purvi pakistan (ab bangladesh) tha
 The Indian side said that it would be immoral, this is Pakistan
 america general ne kaha- ‘murkh aadmi, tumhaari sarhad or tumhaara mulk lutaa ja rahaa he or tumhen abhi bhi naitikta sujh rahi he’!kaash, kashmir kii samasya waisi hoti jaisi bihar kaa pichhadaapan yaa maharashtra ke suukhaagrast kisaanon kii he
 In such a situation, the 'opinion' of Kashmiris would have value
 lekin kashmir saamaanya maamla nahin he or uskaa samaadhaan bhi ‘saamaanya’ nahin hoga
 When a patient gets cancer, he is not given fever medicine
 jo log kashmiriyon kii raay kii baat karte hai, aisa lagata he ve sirf ghati ke logon ko kashmiri maanate hai
 In his opinion, the people of Kashmir's refugee Hindus, Jammu and Ladakh have no importance
 or agar is vyavastha ko baqayada anya vidheyakon kii tarah laayaa jaataa to kya us samvedansheel simapraant ke updrav or antarrashtriya dabaav ko jhela ja saktaa tha? jaahir he, 370 naam ke ‘gale kii haddi’ kaa shikaar ghaat lagaakar hi kiya ja saktaa tha
 When there is a dacoity attack in the house, there is no debate on the sharing of property between the brothers
 desh ke bahut saare kanoon banane ke peeche janata kii mahaj kagaji or (kai baar to wo bhi nahin) raay lee jaati he or lakhon-karodon logon ke pratyaksh-apratyaksh virodh ke baavjood is desh main aarakshan or essi-asti ke liye vishesh praavdhaan lagu hote rahe he
 This happened because it had the power of logic, the ointment of humanity and the fragrance of the future
 anuchhed 370 or 35e un tamaam baton kaa nishedh karata tha jo vyapak samta, nyaay or swatantraaa se judi thim
 Here one recounts the story of Mahabharata in which, like Article 370, many people were living in heavy confusion
 drishtiheen bade bhai ke badale yoddha chote bhai ko gaddi mili, to bade ne samajha yah asthaayee he
 But when the blind was made king after the untimely death of Pandu, he understood that now this system is permanent
 phir us raja kii vyavastha ne apane sangrakshit logon par julm dhana shuru kar diya or aniatik, aviveki or asabhy tareeke apnaane laga
 Finally, there was a war of Mahabharata in which Krishna told Arjuna that to end this unethical and unreasonable system, war would have to be done and every method would be tried for him
 aap chahen to kah sakate hai ki ek aniatik or aviveki vyavastha kaa ant aloktantrit tareeke se hua he
 Because democracy is not just a means, it is also practicable
 aaiye kashmiriat or bhartiyata ko sahi tareeke se judane kaa mauka diya jaae or vahaan loktantr ke ek nae yug kii shuruyaat ho
 (PS: -one of the teenagers today is 'friendzone')
 kashmir, bharat ke saath friendzon kaa rishta chahta he, jabaki raajnneeti main sirf relationships chalati he
 In a relationship you can be the boss, just sit together and eat pizza in the Friendzone)
 (sushant jha hind pocket books (penguin india) ke hindi sampadak hai
 The views expressed here are his own
 india today kii unase sahmati aavashyak nahin he)*** When the people of a country become smart and smart, election after election, does the politics of that country start to get as much disgrace and sarcasm! In 2019 a new equation is being created between the people and the leaders
 ek taraf honge ve voter jo apni jindagi dekhakar vot dene lage hai or duusari taraf hai netaa jinaki siyasat or peeche khisak gai he
 The Modi government has been engaged in the invention of its MGNREGA for five whole years, through which it can be used to do charisma
 vah bhul gai ki upie kii duusari jeet manaregaa nahin balki 2005-08 ke bich gaanv or shahari arthvyavastha main tej vruddhi se nikali thi
 MNREGA had helped in increasing the income
 bhaajapa ab chand aisi skiimon (jan dhan, swasthya, beemaa, gaanvon main bijli) ko karamaati bataakar chunaav main utarane vaali hai jinhen baar-baar aajamaaya gaya par nattejey nahin badalte
 There are 29 lakh vacancies in the government, no resources to recruit and reservation balloons were blown in government jobs on economic grounds
 duusari taraf vipaksh ke bich gathbandhanon kaa vahi len dein, ankaganit kaa khel
 The promise of looting the treasury and the politics of debt waiver
 chunaavon kii taiyaari main jute satta paksh or vipaksh ke sanvaadon main bhayanak bhavishyaheenata he
 His eyes seem to have been fitted in a dark tunnel, at which ends only elections are seen and nothing else
 rajnatik dal pichley dashak main jis tarah vaade karte the jaisi scimen gadhate the jaise avasarwaadi gathjod karte the, aaj bhi sab kuch vaisaa hi he
 Whereas voters have become more intelligent
 netaa hameshaa mugalate main rahete hai ki voter bhaawanaaon, karishmai netaa or vibhaajak siyasat par riz jaataa he
 But the results of the last three Lok Sabha elections in 13 major states and the assembly elections held during this period show that the GDP growth of the states i
e
 decrease or increase in the rate of wages in the villages has been decisive in the voting decisions
 2004 or 2018 ke bich jin rajyon main aarthik vikaas dar yaa mazdooree badi vahaan sattarudh dalon ko zyada vot mili or vikaas dar kam hone par ulataa hua
 This is the reason that in the first election cycles of 2018, governments in those states (also at the center) got a chance again, which had a good growth rate
 shahari madhya varg hi rajnatik bahason kaa mizaaj tay karata he
 India's middle class is growing steadily
 ab isamen 60 se 70 karod log (da local impact of globaligeshan in south and southeast asia) shaamil hai jinamein shaharon ke chote hunarmand kaamgaar bhi hai
 This is the first time in the last two decades that employment, earnings, consumption and savings have fallen badly together for the middle class in India
 gujarat tak, jo shahari madhya varg sattarudh bhaajapa ke saath tha vah baad ke chunaavon main satta virdohi lahar ke haq main aa gaya
 In 25 years of economic liberalization, the country has understood three things which the leaders could not understand
 ek: bazaar jitna bada or sarkaar jitani choti hogi rojgaar utane hi badhengedo: sarkaar kaa kharch rojgaar or kamai kaa vikalp nahin he
 If the government is honest it can increase the earning opportunities to the extent Haitian: Government schemes can only help in crises and increase facilities provided that the ways of working of governments are changed
 gaur se dekhie, chunaav se pehle bharat kii raajnneeti hamen kya thama rahi he: aarakshan, gathbandhan or aajamaai ja chuki scimen
 Countries in the west are worried about not getting good governments out of elections
 unako lagata he ki matadaata sahi faisla nahin kar pate christopher achen or laire bartels kii taaja pustak demokrasi for realists—whai electiosans du note produs risponsive gavarnement khaasi charchaa main rahi he jo bataati he ki chunaavon main matadaata vibhaajak raajnneeti main bah jate hai lekin bharat ke chunaav nattejey baar-baar is baat kii taakid karte hai ki yahaan ke bhole matadaata europe or america ke votaron se kahin zyada samajhadaar hai
 The proverb on India as 'the public, the leader' has always been proved wrong
 yah sanyog he yaa duryog lekin 2019 main pehle se kahin zyada sayaanaa matadaata, pehle se kahin zyada pichhadi raajnneeti ke saamne hoga
 We are entitled to far better leaders than the politics we are getting
 *** a surprise incident occurred on Sunday near Siliguri in West Bengal
 khataranaak stant karte hue ek stant main kii jaan chali gai
 He was crossing the long distance between the two mountains hanging from the rope
 lekin aadhe raste main hi uske saath kuch aisa hua, ki wo hawa main latakta rah gaya
 Stuntman Shailendra was on the run

 Some were playing applause, while some were making noise, increasing the enthusiasm of the stuntman
 is hausala afjai ke bich aadhi duuri is stantman ne tay kar lee thi
 But what happened after that, no one had even thought about it
 kehane kii jarurat nahin he ki stantman shailendra kaa ye tamaasha uski jindagi kaa aakhri tamaasha sabit ho gaya
 In the desire to make a record, he was doing these stunts, but life fell short, the breath stopped
 shailendra ko aspataal le jaaya gaya, lekin vahaan pahunchane se pehle hi sab kuch khatm ho chukaa tha
 Shailendra Roy was doing such a dangerous stunt, but there was no rescue team present there
 wo bhi tab, jab shailendra pashchim bengal police main homeguard kii naukari karte the
 When asked by the police commissioner, he dismissed it as a personal matter of Shailendra
 silligudi ke police kamishnar, jayraman ke mutabik ye program unki jaankaree main tha lekin shailendra chuttee par the
 This was not his official program
 mashhoor stantman shailendra kaa ye stant jindagi kaa aakhri sho sabit hua
 Proved to be the last spectacle of life safar manzil se pehle khatm ho gaya
 The spectacle he left behind, was clapping a while ago, but when he saw the stuntman's last spectacle, his eyes got wet
 holi ke rang kisi ke liye bhi khatarnaak ho sakate hai kyonki bazaar main bikne vaale zyaadaatar rangon main khatarnaak chemicals mili hote hai

 According to him, chemical dyes can have a serious effect during pregnancy

 If a pregnant woman comes in contact with them, she may have problems related to premature delivery, child development
 kai baar to ye rang or mithaiyaan garbhpaat kaa kaaran bhi ban sakate hai
 Dr
 archana kaa kahana he ki holi par rang khelnaa he to khelen lekin uske liye natural rangon kaa istemaal karnaa hi sabase acha rahegaa
 They say that the consumption of more sweets and carbonated beverages increases the level of sugar in the body, which increases the risk of diabetes

 unhone kaha, yah aalochana jaij he
 But if the RBI had not taken steps, then inflation would have reached 12 or 13 percent and not 9
 7 fisad
 Regarding the convertibility of rupee capital account, he said that it will not happen until fiscal stability comes, financial markets do not develop further and the growth rate is not stable and inflation is not stable

 It is worth noting that the Supreme Court had given a verdict in the ramjanmabhoomi-babri Masjid dispute in Ayodhya recently, this case was circling the courts for decades
 supreme court ke faisle ke anusaar vivaadit bhoomi ko hindu paksh ko de diya gaya he, vahiin muslim paksh ko ayodhya main 5 acre kii jameen alag se di gai he
 He first made politics a delight, then made him a ladder and made a different position in the politics of Uttarakhand
 lekin vakt ne karavat lee to siyasatdanon ne bhi berukhi dikhaakar munh mode liya, varanaa shuchita kii baat karne vaala sangh parivaar ho yaa ‘party vid diference’ kaa naaraa dene vaali bijepi yaa phir congress, sabhi kii meharbaani uttarakhand alpsankhyak ayog ke purv adhyaksh sukhdev singh namdhari par baraabar rahi he
 The story of the 45-year-old Namdhari, arrested in the ponty-hardeep Chadha brothers murder case, coming from the floor to Arsh, seems filmy, but it is another recent example of criminalization of politics and politicization of crime
 trek driver se lalabatti tak kaa rutaba hasil karne vaala namdhari 15 saal pehle tak uttarakhand ke kashipur seat se maujuuda bijepi vidhayak harbhajan singh cheema kaa nijee suraksha guard rahaa
 Cheema was himself involved in the business of mining and had a dispute over land with Gurubachan Lal Sharma aka Pandit Sharma associated with the forest mafia and petrol pump business of Bajpur
 inhen dinon tarai kshetra main punjab ke aatankwaad kaa asar charam par tha or isi dauraan cheema ke bete kii hatya ho gai
 Cheema suspected that Pandit Sharma was behind the killing of his son
 isi bich 7 farvari, 1995 ko sharma kii goli markar hatya kar di gai to is hatya main namdhari samet saat log namjad hue the
 It is alleged that in order to become trustworthy of Cheema, Namdhari has killed Sharma by making an army of goons
 jald hi namdhari tarai main mafia ke rup main sthapit ho gaya or kathith taur par cheema kii madad se kaaphi sampatti banaai
 In this journey, the list of cases against Namdhari also became longer
 bajpur thane main hatya, dakaiti samet 12, kashipur main do or upi ke rampur main us par ek mukadmaa darj he
 But when there was a reconciliation between the Sharma family and Cheema, Namdhari joined BJP leader Arvind Pandey, who has been very close to former Chief Minister Bhagat Singh Koshyari
 kaha jaataa he ki namdhari jald hi koshyari kaa khaas ban gaya or siyasat par uski pakad majboot hoti chali gai
 Meanwhile, Namdhari also met Ponty Chadha and Ponty entrusted him with the job of mining contracts in Haridwar
 lekin uski siyaasi hanak hi thi ki tamaam aaropon ke baavjood 2006 main use na sirf sangh ke anushangik sanghathan rashtriya sikh sangat kaa adhyaksh bana diya gaya, balki chaar saal ke bheetar hi nishank sarkaar ne pradesh alpsankhyak ayog ke adhyaksh kii kursi ke saath lalabatti kaa rutaba thama diya, jabaki tarai main gadarpur ke bijepi vidhayak arvind pandey ko chhodkar party ke sabhi vidhayak namdhari kaa virodh kar rahe the
 Not only this, two Chief Ministers changed in the state during this period, but Namdhari managed to save his chair
 haalanki india today se purv mukhyamantri ramesh pokharial ‘nishank’ kehete hai, ‘‘sarkaar kisi ek vyakti kii nahin hoti
 Namdhari's name was suggested by the organization
 namdhari ke aapraadhik record ke bare main jitani baaten ab saamne aa rahi hai, tab aisi koi jaankaree nahin mili thi
 MLA Pandey has been rejecting personal relations with Namdhari outright
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘sanghathan main or sthaneey hone kii vajah se mere sambandh jarur the, lekin vyaktigat sambandh nahin the
 Their thinking and activities were always questionable, so i broke away from them
 namdhari ne chunaav main meraa virodh bhi kiya tha
 i complained to the high command, but Namdhari was patronized by some big leaders
 meraa namdhari ke saath koi kaarobaar nahin tha, bevajaah meraa naam usase joda ja rahaa he
 "but on the question of not immediately removing Namdhari even when Congress comes to government, Yashpal Arya, a minister in Vijay Bahuguna government, says," The government has adopted the entire process to remove Namdhari
 pehle hataane kii maang hui thi, lekin sanvaidhanik pad hone kii vajah se ek prakriya ke tahat hi karrwai hoti he
 "it is no longer acceptable to the leaders to associate their names with Bhale Namdhari, but the BJP stood by him till the police arrested him
" congress kii vijay bahuguna sarkaar ne 20 november ko namdhari ko alpsankhyak ayog ke adhyaksh pad se barkhaast karne main teji dikhaai to rajya bijepi ke adhyaksh bishan singh chuphaal or vipaksh ke netaa ajay bhatta ne namdhari kaa bachaav kiya
 Bhatt even went on to say, "political people continue to be accused, the government has taken the decision of dismissal in a hurry, it is not fair
" ” jabaki chuphaal kii tippanee thi, ‘‘jab tak namdhari ke khilaaf kuch sabit nahin hota tab tak vah party main hai or party unke saath he
 However, after creating a furore, the BJP expelled Namdhari from the party on 26 November
 lekin puraa ghatnakram namdhari kii rajnatik paith ko hi jaahir karata he
 Not only Uttarakhand, its reach is told in seven states of the country
 namdhari ne bandook kaa license punjab se 1985 main banwaaya tha
 All the aspects related to Namdhari are being investigated after being named in the Ponty murder case, but its threat in Uttarakhand had the effect of canceling the arms license in a report sent by the Bazpur police to the DM office on March 6, 2009 The recommendation was made, but in this case the first notice was issued after three years in March 2012

 bajpur main use dagaabaaz ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 It is said that whether it is a matter of estrangement between the Cheema brothers or now the property dispute between Ponty Chadha and Hardeep Chadha, Namdhari took a lot of interest and took advantage in such cases
 lekin chaddha bandhuon ke bich hui golibari ke dauraan namdhari maukey par maujuud tha
 He has now been booked for murder of Hardeep in this case
 jaahir he ki namdhari ko vakt ke saath kadamtal karne kii takanic bakhubi maaloom thi, isliye siyasat main jab jo oonchai par rahaa uske saath ho liye

 haalanki yah episod buudhvaar ko bevesite par prasaarit hua, lekin kuch kaat-chhaant ke saath
 Dua's talk was removed from the show, in which he described the # metoo campaign as a tactic to divert public attention during the election year
 sho ke pehle varjan main dua ne logon kaa dhyaan is ore khinchaa he ki media vaastavik muddon par baat karne ke bajaay isamen ulajhaa he ki kisne kiskaa yon utpeedan kiya or vah bhi kitne saal pehle
 Dua said in the show, 'the elections which are coming closer, the questions that should be asked, they are going in the background, neither the government media nor the court media is raising them, nor are the newspapers raising them
 
 
 
 jo charchaa main he wo ye he ki kisne, kitne saal pehle, kiskaa sexual haraasament kiya, yaa pareshaan kiya, is par charchaa chal rahi he
 
 
 Which also includes a Union Minister
 isamen thodaa keechad mujh par bhi uchhaala gaya he
 
 
 i will also mention that
 ' # metoo ke tahat lagaae ja aaropon par dua ne kaha, 'sarkaar se kaayade se jo sawaal puche jane chahie, jo ekadam chup gaye hai, is puri dibet main, is puure shor main ki koun koun pakadaa ja rahaa he, yaa kis kis par aarope lag rahe hai sirf
 At the end of the show, Dua also talks about the allegations leveled against him
 wo kehete hai, 'mujh par bhi wo keechad uchhaala gaya he, ek aisa keechad, sexual haraasament kaa to nahin he
 
 
 To bother ' dua ne kaha, '30 saal pehle kisi mahila ko laga ki maine kuch aisa kiya jisase unhen pareshaani hui
 Now this is a mud that can be put on the clergyman's cloak, the judge's cloak, the lawyer's cloak, the priest's cloak, any decent man's, The doctor may also apply
 'dua ne kaha, 'keechad ek dafe lag gaya, to jis par phenkaa gaya, wo kya kar saktaa he sivaay iske ki wo inkaar kare ki aisa nahin hua he
 Dua said - I, who have been accused of me, are denying them outright, rejecting that they are absolutely baseless, imagine someone, nothing has happened
 lekin, kyonki main aapke prati javabdeh hum, 'da vir' ke prati javabdeh hum, isliye aaj se
 
 
 Suspending this program for a week

 According to the film 'airlift', Ranjit Katyal was a big businessman of Indian origin in Kuwait at that time
 ranjit bhi us samay khud ko bhartiya kam or kuwaiti zyada maanane lage the
 The Indian government talked to them about evacuating the Indians trapped there
 ranjit kii vahaan kii sarkaar or prashasan main bhi kaaphi paith thi, isliye bharatiyon ko vahaan se nikaalane main ranjit ne badi bhoomika nibhaai
 The comments samay kii reporton ke anusaar saddaam hossain pashchimi deshon kii baat bilkul bhi sunne ko taiyaar nahin the, jiske kaaran america ne un par hamalaa bhi bol diya tha
 According to reports, he actually allowed Indians to leave Kuwait after the intervention of Foreign Minister Indra Kumar Gujral
 haalanki sarkaar ne kisi ranjit katyaal se kisi bhi tarah kii madad lene kii baat kabhi sweekaar nahin kii
 NDTV does not confirm whether Ranjit Katyal is actually there or not
 isi ranjit katyaal ko hero ke taur par pesh karke 'airlift' kii kahani buni gai he, jo bharat kaa ab tak kaa sabase safal rescue abhiyaan rahaa he
 According to the reports of the time, Saddam Hussein was not ready to listen to the western countries at all, due to which the US also attacked him
 reporton ke mutabik asal main videsh mantri indra kumaar gujral ke dakhal ke baad unhone bharatiyon ko kuwait se nikalne diya
 However, the government never accepted any help from any Ranjit Katyal
 ranjit katyaal asal main hai yaa nahin is bare main enditivi koi pushti nahin karata
 By presenting this Ranjit Katyal as a hero, the story of 'airlift' has been woven, which has been India's most successful rescue campaign till date
 haalanki sarkaar ne kisi ranjit katyaal se kisi bhi tarah kii madad lene kii baat kabhi sweekaar nahin kii
 NDTV does not confirm whether Ranjit Katyal is actually there or not

 If we tell you that there are ghosts in the house of Queen Elizabeth of Britain
 to aap yakeen nahin karenge
 but it's true
 in bhuton ko chahie insaaf
 The sound of his footsteps is still heard in the palace of the Queen
 ji haa, mahal ke kamare main ghuste hi tej sirdard hota he, mahal main aaj bhi sunai detii he bhuton ke kadamon kii aahat, jahaan aaj bhi kamare se saaf nahin hota he khun kaa dhabba
 The world has felt this reality for centuries
 vaigyanikon ne isapar research kiya or muhar lagaai ki britain kii maharani ke mahal ke andar chupa he kuch rahasy
 This is not happening in London's Barkidham Palace but in another palace of Queen Elizabeth, Holyrood Castle
 us kaisal kii ho rahi he jahaan maharani aaj bhi aaraam ke kuch pal gujaarne jaati hai 
 Holyrood Castle is the mysterious fort where the soul of a queen who lived nearly 400 years ago is still seeking justice for her death
 aaj bhi vah kisi ko chaiyn se us kile main nahin rahane detii he
 As soon as entering the fort, an unknown fear strikes in the heart of the people
 scotland kii rajdhani edinburgh, great britain kaa vah hissaa jahaan duniya bhar se sailaaniyon ke aane ke silsilaa saalon jari rahata he
 But ghosts are a big reason for tourists here
 yahaan ke kilon main sabase bhootaha kila he hollyrud kaisal
 The fort which once housed the Queen here and which is still the official residence of the British Queen in Scotland
 lekin duniya kahati he ki edinburgh ke is kile main puraane raajaaon kii aatma aaj bhi rahati he or unke saath rahete hai bhoot
 Those ghosts make a lot of chaos in this fort and no one has said this
 balki ek hi bhoot ko bees bees logon ne dekha he
 It dates back to the 16th century
 is kile main rahati thi bhalaa kii khubasurat ek rani queen mairi
 In 1565 he was married to Lord Henry
 lekin kuch hi vakt main meri kaa dil henry se bhar gaya or unki nazdikiyaan david naam ke ek shaks se ho gai
 The king became suspicious of the queen
 henry ne mairi ko harkaton se baj aane ko kaha
 But i did not listen and one day when i was enjoying the royal feast with David
 tabhi raja kii aguwai main kuch sipaahi vahaan aae or unhone david ko duusare kamare main le jaakar uski hatya kar di
 It is said that his David's soul has been seeking justice ever since
 jo bhi us kamare main jaataa he uske sir main dard hone lagata he
 Many claimed to have seen David's ghost
 baad main raja kii bhi hatya ho gai or shaq kii sui rani kii taraf gai
 Rani escaped leaving the palace and reached England
 lekin vahaan bhi uski mushkilen kam nahin hui or rajgaddi ke khilaaf sajeesh main shaamil hone ke aarope main uskaa sar kalam kar diya gaya
 The souls of Raja Rani and her lover three are still wandering in the Ballirud Castle
 britain kii maharani elizabeth kaa mahal hollyrud kaisel
 This fort is as historical as it is mysterious
 aaj tak jis kisi ne is kile ke andar kadam rakhaa uske saath kuch naa kuch ajeeb zarur hua
 If someone was confronted with a frightening spirit, then someone got hurt in a strange way
 zyaadaatar log to is imaarat ko thik se dekhne kii khwaahish bich main chhodkar bhaag khadey hue
 When someone heard the call from the rooms, someone saw a mysterious shadow moving around
 kareeb aath das saal pehle vaigyanikon kaa ek dal bhuton kii sachai jaanane ke liye is imaarat ke andar gaya tha
 Scientists could not reach any conclusion, but they also believed that this is definitely something that is beyond everyone's understanding
 kile kii kahani bas itane par khatm nahin hoti he
 a tunnel leading out of the fort also boasts countless horror stories
 kaha jaataa he ki hollyrud kaisal main ek surang he jo saamne ke us kile ke judata he jo khud bhuton kaa bahut bada baseraa he
 The name of that fort is Edinburgh Castle, from the sixth century to 1603, this fort used to be the royal residence of the kings of Scotland
 edinburgh kasal ek niskriy jwalamukhi ke munh par bana hua he
 It is said that there used to be many tunnels in this fort
 jinamein se ek sunrag kaa rasta hollyrud kaisal tak jaataa tha
 The tunnel was connected to Holyrood Castle so that if anyone tries to capture the king by attacking him, he can escape to this place safely
 lekin rasta check karne ke liye raja ne ek bagpyper bajaane vaale ko surang main bheja
 But he does not know where he got lost in the sound
 kehete hai tab se lekar aaj tak us sunrag se bagpyper kii dhun aaj bhi sunai detii he or surang ke andar ajeeb se halchal kaa bhi pataa chalata he
 It is said that every room in the Edinburgh Castle, every tunnel has been accepted by the ghosts and they leave no stone unturned to drive away anyone who comes inside

 In fact, the time has come when India should come out of the RCEP, taking strict and clear decisions
 '' He said in the letter that the RCEP agreement is a major threat and is not an opportunity for India in any way
 mahajan ne kaha, ‘‘esageem kaa maananaa he ki aarasieepi bharat ke logon ke hit main nahin he

" vastav main ab samay aa gaya he jabaki bharat ko sakht or spasht faisla karte hue aarasieepi se baahar nikalnaa chahie
 '' unhone patr main kaha ki aarasieepi qaraar ek pramukh khatra he or yah bharat ke liye kisi tarah se avasar nahin he
 Mahajan said, "SJM believes that RCEP is not in the interest of the people of India
" bharat main koi bhi kshetra, ilaaka aisa nahin he jise aarasieepi se laabh hoga
 '' (input bhashaa se) He said in the letter that the RCEP agreement is a major threat and is not an opportunity for India in any way
