 lekin goyal kehete hai, 'jab rishu ko mili madad kii khabar saarvajanik ho chuki thi, to yah third party maamla kaise he?'yah maamla kendriya soochna ayog pahunchaa, lekin goyal kaa aarope he, 'tatkaaleen kendriya mukhya soochna ayukta vajahat habibulla ne merit par faisla nahin diya tha, kyonki ve khud piemo main sanyukt sachiv rah chuke hai
 'but in a conversation with India Today, Habibullah gives an example, saying,' Now the flood in Uttarakhand came and the funds were given from the relief fund
 yah jaankaree saarvajanik kii ja sakati he ki raahat ke liye kitni raashi di gai, lekin us paise se kiskaa ghar bana isaki jaankaree nahin di ja sakati
 'the country's first Chief Information Commissioner Habibullah, who himself has taken charge of the Relief Fund as Joint Secretary in the PMO, believes that there should be transparency in this fund
 kis mudde ke liye raashi di gai, use bataaya ja saktaa he
 i had said in my decision as a CIC that the Relief Fund also comes under the purview of the Public Authority
 ' lekin piemo ise nahin maanata
 How and for whom is the fund? As simple as this question is, the more complex the answer
 is kosh kii sthapana desh ke pehle pradhanmantri pan
 Jawaharlal Nehru's appeal was issued in January 1948, in which he created the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund to help the migrants from Pakistan
 us apil ke mutabik fund kaa sanchaalan ek cameti karegi, jisamen pradhanmantri, congress adhyaksh, up pradhanmantri, vitt mantri, tata nyaasiyon kaa, pratinidhi or pradhanmantri raahat kosh kii prabandh samiti main federation of indian chambers of commers dwaara namit sadsy honge
 But according to the PMO website, all decisions are made by the PM with discretion
 ab is kosh kaa istemaal baadh, chakravaat, bukamp, durghatnaon-dangon ke peediton ko raahat dene ke alaava dil kii surgery, gurda pratyaropan, cancer jaisi gambhir or mahange ilaaj ke liye bhi hota he
 The fund is governed not by budgetary provision, but by donations from citizens, companies, institutions
 isamen daan karne waalon ko anshdaan par inakam tex bhugtan main chhot milti he
 But there is no process to select the eligible persons for assistance from this fund
 sahaayta puri tarah se pradhanmantri ke vivek or unke nirdeshon ke anusaar di jaati he
 The work of this fund is looked after by the Joint Secretary level officer of the PMO as the Secretary of Relief Commission , while a Director level officer is posted to assist him
 aapadaa ke samay pradhanmantri raahat raashi kaa elaan karte hai, lekin gambhir bimariyon ke liye garib vyakti ek sade kaagaj par aavedan de saktaa he
 But everyone gets help from this fund, it would be unwise to think
 piemo se uplabdh aankadon ke mutabik, varsh 2000 se 21 sitambar, 2008 tak 2,14,558 aavedan aae, lekin is dauraan sirf 82, 310 logon ko hi raahat kosh se sahaayta mil pai
 No one knows how these people were elected
 na aap yah puch sakate hai
 This means that the entire scam of the scam is ready here
 yahaan ek or baat dilachasp he ki jab rishu ko dil kii surgery ke liye piemo ne 50,000 rupee kii maamuli sahaayta di, us vittiya varsh 2008-09 main piem raahat kosh main kul 1,611 karod rupee shesh the, jabaki 2011-12 main 1,698 karod rupee
 On the Rishu case, Ajay Goyal raises the question, 'why didn't the PMO make such an arrangement instead of financial help so that it can get free treatment in hospitals taking land from the government at a discounted rate
 aakhir piemo ne un aspataalon ko garibon ke ilaaj ke liye dhanrashi kyon jari kii, jo kanoonee taur par garibon kaa ilaaj karne ke liye baadhya hai
 'the Fund is not audited by the constitutional body CAG, but by external chartered accountants
 chupaane ke liye surkhiyon main kosh2005 main soochna ke adhikaar adhinium ke lagu hone ke baad se pradhanmantri rashtriya raahat kosh soochna chhipaane ko lekar hi surkhiyon main rahaa he
 However, the Central Information Commission has rejected those pleas of the Prime Minister's Office that it does not come under the purview of RTI
 pratham soochna ayukta habibulla ne shailesh gandhi banaam piemo cese main faisla diya tha, chunki is raahat kosh kaa sanchaalan piemo karata he, isliye soochna muhaiyaa karai jaani chahie
 However, the same Shailesh Gandhi was later made the Central Information Commissioner, who had kept a long front to make the information about the Prime Minister's Relief Fund public
 ayukta banane se pehle 2006 main gandhi ne raahat kosh se do saal main jari kii gai kul raashi, sansthaaon kii sankhya, sahaayta paane vaale sansthaaon ke naam, uddeshy, kitni raashi di gai or balance shit maanga tha
 But the PMO directed Gandhi to check the official website of the PMO instead of sending a clear reply
 shailesh gandhi ne soochna ayukta niyukt hone ke baad is maamle main aisi koi pahal nahin kii he jo saarvajanik jaankaree main ho
 When this matter reached the Central Information Commission, the PMO said that since the PM Relief Fund is not a public authority, it is not obliged to give any information about this fund
 siisi ko die likhit jawaab main piemo ne kaha, 'piem raahat kosh kii sthapana samvidhan, sansad-vidhansabha ke banaae kanoon yaa kisi upyukt sarkaar kii adhisuchana ke tahat nahin hui he
 Government is not in control of this fund
 ' piemo ke mutabik, ‘yah ek privet fund he jo svaichhik rup se milane vaale daan se chalata he, jiskaa sarkaar se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 The PMO also cited the Rules of Action of both the Houses of Parliament, according to which the question of relief fund is not allowed to be raised in Parliament
 lekin tatkaaleen mukhya soochna ayukta habibulla ne 15 march, 2007 ko apane faisle main kaha he, 'bhale piem raahat kosh trust yaa vaidhanik sanstha nahin he, lekin yah fund pradhanmantri karyaalay ke niyantran main he or vahi kriyanvayan karata he
 It cannot be an independent public authority, but since its information is maintained by the PMO, the RTI as a public authority should provide all the information which does not fall under Section 8 of the law
 ' lekin is faisle main ayog ne labhaarthiyon ke naam ko gupt rakhane kii piemo kii daleel maan lee
 Haryana resident and RTI activist Aseem Takyar asked for details of donors and beneficiaries to the PM Relief Fund between 2009 and 2011, but habitually PMO again called for Section 8
 lekin 6 june, 2012 ko apane faisle main mukhya soochna ayukta ne kaha, 'yah sach he ki is raahat kosh main sarkari fund nahin aata
 But there is also the fact that the PMO operates it
 aksar dekha gaya he ki kai daankarta apana naam media main prachaarit karte hai, isliye agar daankarta apana naam gupt rakhane kii maang nahin karata, to samay-samay par suchi jari karnaa ek acha vichaar ho saktaa he
 At least the name of the charity institution should be released
 ' haalanki ayog ne labhaarthiyon ke maamle main naam na bataane ke nirnay ko jari rakhaa
 In this case, the Central Government appealed in the Delhi High Court
 july, 2012 ko soochna ayog ke aadesh par court ne ste laga diya
 Why is the PM Relief Fund so stubborn in terms of transparency? naam gupt rakhana majaburi he yaa maajaraa kuch or he?visheshgy kii raayah subhash chandra agarwalsaarvajanik kosh yaa nijee jaagir?pradhanmantri rashtriya raahat kosh ko lekar kaaphi vivaad rahaa he kyonki isamen daan dene waalon or labhaarthiyon ke naam gupt rakhe jate hai
 The Central Information Commission, in its decision, has considered this fund to be a fund administered by the Prime Minister's Office, which receives funding from several public authorities, among others
 yah bada vivaad ab bhi bana hua he ki pradhanmantri raahat kosh se anudaan praapt karne vaale logon ke naam saarvajanik kiye jaaen yaa nahin
 The Central Information Commission has asked to reveal the name of the donor, if he does not want to keep it secret
 magar piem raahat kosh ke labhaarthiyon ke naamon kaa khulaasa avashya kiya janaa chahie kyonki ye labhaarthi ek saarvajanik praadhikaran se dhan praïpt kar rahe hai
 The public also has the right to know how the applications for receiving help from the PM Relief Fund are disposed of
 shehanai vadak bharat ratna bismilla khan ne media ke madhyam se aarthik madad tathaa apane parivaar ke liye aajeevika ke saadhan (gas agency) kaa intjaam kiye jane ke anurodh ko saarvajanik kiya
 If anyone needs the government's help, then one should not feel ashamed of it
 labhaarthiyon ke naamon ko saarvajanik kiya janaa kisi aise vyakti dwaara apane adhikaar ke durupyog kiye jane ko bhi rokegaa jo avasarwaadi raajnneeti ke vartmaan yug main kisi tarah pradhanmantri kaa mahatvapurn pad hasil karne main kaamyaab ho gaya ho
 This will also curb the partisan decisions taken by the highly placed people on the recommendation of someone to help with this fund
 piem raahat kosh saarvajanik nidhi he or logon ko anudaan labhaarthiyon kii vaastavik jaruraton ke hisaab se diya janaa chahie na ki sifarish karne vaale logon ke hisaab se

 On the India Today State of States Bihar forum, the state governor Lalji Tandon spoke his views on all issues with utmost care
 ram mandir par puche gaye sawaal main unhone kaha ki is maamle main nyaay jahaan se milanaa chahie, vahaan se avrodh khadaa ho gaya he
 He said that our country is the largest democracy in the world and the judicial system is seen here with respect from all over the world
 ayodhya maamle par dedh sau saal se karod log lard rahe hai
 We are witness to this
 is maamle main samaadhaan kii koshish kii gai, lekin nyaay palika main maamla hone ke chalate main koi tippanee nahin kar saktaa
 However, there was a barrage from where justice should be met
 unhone kaha ki koi samasya he hi nahin, ek sunwaayee main hi iskaa faisla ho saktaa he
 This matter is not in the priorities of the judiciary, but someone had commented that if the struggle and sacrifice of 100 crore people for decades, which is related to the security of the country, is not in the priority of the court, nothing more can be said
 
 tandon ne kaha ki prayag (elahabaad kaa nayaa naam) ek prakritik naam he, yah kisi vyakti par aadhaarit nahin he
 During this time he also shared his memories with his book - Ankaha Lucknow and former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 lalji tandon ne kaha ki lakhanu ko basaane kaa kaam lakshmana ne kiya tha
 No historian has denied this
 isse pehle ise lakshmanpur or lakshmanavati ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Later it was also called Lakhanpur
 angreji bhashaa main vah lakhanu ho gaya
 He said that Lucknow is only a distortion of Lakhanpur or Lakshmanpur
 tandon ne kaha ki ek kahani yah bhi he ki jab angrejon ne lakhanu par kabja kar liya to naachte hue kaha ki 'lack nau' yani aaj hamaara bhagya jag gaya
 And Luck became Lucknow only later
 unhone aage kaha ki kuch log apane laabh yaa haani ke hisaab se itihaas main milawat karte hai
 There was a lot of confusion about Lucknow and by presenting such an appearance of Lucknow that this Nawab and Kabab was reduced to two words
 nawabon ko bhi mughalkaal main avadh kaa soobedaar banaaya gaya tha
 He said that Lucknow is also a part of the country, its culture is not different from the country
 unhone is dauraan samaajawaadee netaa ram manohar lohia kaa bhi zikr kiya or unke saath apni yaaden bhi saajha kii
 He told that earlier Haridwar district did not exist, the district used to be Saharanpur
 sari duniya vahaan haridwar ke naam se snaan karne aati thi
 Who knows Faizabad like this, the whole world knows Ayodhya
 unhone kaha ki chaahe ham kisi bhi dal main hon hamaari saanskrithik soch ke hisaab se hamaare man main hameshaa se ye bhav hameshaa aate hai
 In response to Aaj Tak's anchor Anjana Om Kashyam's question, Tandon said that you decide for yourself whether the names should be changed or not
 jahaan tak lakhanu ko badalane kaa sawaal he to yah kahin nahin miltaa he ki ise lakshmana ke alaava kisi or ne basaaya ho
 Also, Tandon said that as far as Prayag is concerned, it is a natural name
 ye kisi vyakti se sambandhit nahin he
 The railway station in the Sangam area is still called Prayag
 yah aaj se nahin bahut dinon se he
 This is not a new name
 prayag se aashay us jagah se he jahaan, ek se zyada nadiyon kaa sangam hota he
 There are five Prayag in Uttarakhand

" match ke kaaran vahaan badi sankhya main darshakon kii bheed thi
 Afghan officials told of the number of casualties, so far, 50 people have been confirmed dead in the incident

 Governor as per the central government's order until a decision is reached in the Supreme Court or this order is rejected

 uparajyapal se mulaakaat ke baad kejariwal ne press conference karke kaha ki jis tareeke se centre sarkaar nyaayalay ke adeshon kii avmaananaa kar rahi he, isse araajaktaa ko badhaava milegaa

 Taking a dig at Team Anna, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee dismissed the allegations of corruption leveled against him as 'unfair' and 'selfish' and said that it shows lack of responsibility in those who have high standards of ethical behavior
 Claims to represent

 Mukherjee said that false allegations were being leveled against him due to vested interests and malfeasance and the facts were hidden in him
 congress ke varisht netaa ne hajaare or unke sahyogiyon ko yaad dilaayaa ki unhone is prakaar ke aaropon ko lagaakar us naitikta ko taak par rakh diya jiskaa vah daawa karte hai
 In a letter addressed by Mukherjee to Hazare, Arvind Kejriwal, Shanti Bhushan, Prashant Bhushan, Kiran Bedi and Manish Sisodia, it is unfortunate that India Against Corruption, claiming to represent high standards of ethical behavior, has abandoned its moral ground 
 vitt mantri ne team anna dwaara pradhanmantri ko likhe gaye patr ke jawaab main yah baat kahi
 In this letter, Team Anna has reiterated her allegations

 bhartiya cricket team twanti-20 vishwa cap ke antargat mangalvaar ko aar
 They will take on South Africa in their final match of Group-2 of Super-8 to be played at Premadasa Stadium
 varsh 2007 kii champion bhartiya team ko semifinal main pahunchane ke liye dakshin africa ko har haal main haraana hi hoga
 Not only this, his win should be impressive, so that his net run rate can be better than Pakistan
 bharat ko super-8 ke pehle mukaable main australia se karaari shikast jhelni padi thi jabaki duusare mukaable main bharat ne pakistan ko aath wicket se haraaya tha
 The South African team has played two matches in Super-8 so far and has lost in both
 australia sabase behatar net ran rate or chaar ankon ke saath semifinal ke behad kareeb he
 Pakistan are in second place on the basis of better net run rate than India with double digits
 bharat tisare or dakshin africa chauthe kram par he
 India's first eye will also be on the final match of Group-2 between Pakistan and Australia
 yah match yadi australia jeet jaataa he to bhartiya team ke liye semifinal kii raah aasaan ho jaaegi
 In this Surat, she will make it to the semi-finals just by defeating South Africa
 yadi bhartiya team dakshin africa se haar bhi jaati he or uskaa ran ausat pakistan or dakshin africa se behatar rahata he to bhi vah semifinal main pahunch sakati he
 But if Pakistan beats Australia, then there will be no other option for India to defeat South Africa and that too with such a difference that its net run rate is better than Pakistan and Australia, because in the event of Pakistan's victory He and Australia will get four points each and the net run rate of both teams is better than India
 pehle super-8 match main australia se harkar bhartiya team ne apni raah main kaante bo liye
 The victory over Pakistan has made his task somewhat easier but his struggle is not over yet
 dakshin africa team bhale hi kharaab daur se guzar rahi ho lekin is aadhaar par use kamjor nahin aanka ja saktaa
 The South African team, under the captaincy of Abraham De Villiers, has not been technically eliminated from the title race
 bharat ke liye acchhee baat yah he ki uske khilaadiyon ne sahi maukey par acha khel dikhaaya or ek badi jeet ke saath khud ko semifinal kii daud main banaae rakhaa lekin ab uske saamne sambhavat: pakistan ko haraane se zyada badi chunauti he kyonki use jeet ke saath-saath apana net ran rate bhi sudhaarna hoga
 Indian bowlers and batsmen did better against Pakistan
 viraat kohli in dinon jabardast form main hai
 Virat scored an unbeaten 78 against Pakistan while Yuvraj Singh performed all round
 virendra sahvaag ne choti lekin upyogi saajhedaari kar team ko acchhee shuruyaat dilaai thi
 Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni will once again expect good bowling from Laxmipathy Balaji, who took three wickets against Pakistan
 of spinner ravichandran aswin bhi is samay acchhee gendbaaji kar rahe hai
 The comments dakshin africa team bhi is mukaable main jeet darj karnaa chaahegi
 South Africa have world-class batsmen like Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, Jean Paul Duminy and de Villiers who are keen to change the outcome of the match with their batting alone
 gendbaaji main uske paas del sten, morkal bandhu or vyne parnell ke rup main tej akraman he jabaki spin ke rup main johaan botha or robin petersan hai
 India suffered a crushing defeat to Australia in the first match of Super 8 while India defeated Pakistan by eight wickets in the second match
 dakshin africa team super-8 main ab tak do match kheli he or donon main use shikast kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 Australia are very close to the semi-finals with the best net run rate and four points
 pakistan do ankon ke saath bharat se behatar net ran rate ke aadhaar par duusare kram par he
 India is third and South Africa is fourth
 bharat kii pehali najar pakistan or australia ke bich hone vaale group-2 ke antim mukaable par bhi rahegi
 If Australia wins this match, then the semi-final road will become easier for the Indian team
 is surat main dakshin africa ko haraane maatr se vah semifinal main jagah bana legi
 Even if the Indian team loses to South Africa and their average runs are better than Pakistan and South Africa, they can still reach the semi-finals
 lekin pakistan agar australia ko haraa detaa he to phir bharat ke liye dakshin africa ko haraane or vah bhi itane antar se ki pakistan or australia ke mukaable uskaa net ran rate behatar rahe, ke alaava or koi chaara nahin rahegaa kyonki paak kii jeet kii sthiti main uske va australia ke chaar-chaar ank ho jaaenge or donon tiimon kaa net ran rate bharat ke mukaable behatar he
 After losing to Australia in the first Super-8 match, the Indian team took a thorn in its path
 pakistan par mili jeet ne uskaa kaam kuch aasaan kiya he lekin abhi uskaa sangharsh samaapt nahin hua he
 The South African team may be going through a bad phase but it cannot be undermined on this basis
 abraham diviciars kii captaini main dakshin africa team khitaabi daud se takneekee rup main baahar nahin hui he
 The good thing for India is that its players played well at the right moment and kept themselves in the semi-finals race with a big win but now they have a bigger challenge than possibly defeating Pakistan as they have to win - Also your net run rate has to be improved
 bhartiya gendbaajon or ballebaajon ne pakistan ke khilaaf behatar pradarshan kiya tha
 Virat Kohli is in tremendous form these days
 viraat ne pakistan ke khilaaf naabad 78 ran banaae the jabaki yuvaraj singh ne harfanmaulaa pradarshan kiya tha

 ) notebandi ke ek saal guzar chuke hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement was united by the opposition unitedly at 8 pm on 8 November 2016
 ek-do dal ko chhodkar sabane faisle kii mukhaalafat kii thi
 But even after this, if we look at many election results, we will find that the opposition of the opposition against the Modi government has diminished
 notebandi par kyon fail rahaa vipaksh?hua yun ki notebandi ek bahut bada faisla tha
 By the time anyone understood anything, Modi had gone his master stroke
 vipakshi dal or netaa kaaphi samay to faisle ko samajhane main lage rahe
 Even when it came to deciding his stand on it, he had no concrete strategy
 jab vipaksh ke kuch netaa bolnaa shuru kiye tab tak bahut der ho chuki thi
 Opposition parties avoided speaking out openly against the ban on demonetisation because they feared that the way the PM described the decision as attacking the problem of corruption, black money, fake notes and terror funding, it could show them standing in support of the corrupt
 shuru main notebandi ke khilaaf kyon khulkar nahin bol paaya vipakshhaalanki, notebandi ke khilaafmamta, kejariwal, akhilesh or mayawativirodh main utre the par modi sarkaar or bijepi ne in vipadhi netaaon kii chhavi aise bana di jaise ve kaale dhan ke kuberon ko bachaane ke liye kaam kar rahe hon
 This is the reason why the public did not stand behind these leaders in this campaign
 aise main vipakshi dalon or netaaon kaa notebandi kaa virodh karnaa vifal hi nahin balki siyaasi nuksaan bhi uthaanaa padaa
 Amit Shah had made a statement - Mayawati and Mulayam's face have disappeared from demonetisation
 yani bijepi notebandi ko turant kaala dhan se jodne main safal rahi thi
 Positive public opinion: After the announcement of demonetisation of Narendra Modi, the positive reactions received by the public in the media also prevented the opposition from directly opposing this decision
 baad main jab tak vipaksh khulkar iske khilaaf aayaa tab tak bahut der ho chuki thi
 Talking of those who opposed the first day ban on demonetisation, the most vocal were Aam Aadmi Party convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Trinamool Congress supremo and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav
 duusari ore congress notebandi kaa virodh kare yaa notebandi main janata ke liye or zyada raahaton kii maang kare ise lekar kanphyus najar ai
 Rahul Gandhi, in his first tweets after the announcement of 8 November, accused PM Modi of ignoring small farmers, shopkeepers, housewives and asked the question - how to stop a thousand notes and start corruption of two thousand notes Will? Arvind Kejriwal went further to accuse the Modi government that BJP leaders and some corporates were already aware of this demonetisation
 unhone petm jaisi companiyon ke vigyaapan par piem ke photo ko lekar sawaal uthaae
 Kejriwal also reached in front of the Reserve Bank's office for a sit-in with Mamta
 kejariwal ne bhi notebandi ke khilaaf reliyaan karne kaa elaan kiya
 Apart from Delhi and Punjab, his rallies in UP were special
 meerut, lakhanu or varanasi kii unki raily main kuch bheed bhi juty lekin ve akele sarkaar par koi dabaav banane main naakaam rahe
 Describing the entire decision as false, Mamata Banerjee directly demanded to withdraw it
 20 november ko chetavanee di ki piem teen din ke bheetar is faisle ko waapas len varna ve deshbhar main andolan karengi
 But this threat of Mamta's agitation proved to be lousy as her rallies outside West Bengal did not attract crowds
 nitish ne chaunkaaya thabihar ke mukhyamantri or janata dal united ke adhyaksh nitish kumaar ne sabko chaunkaate hue piem modi ke is kadam kaa swaagat kiya tha
 During the road show in Patna, Mamata Banerjee even asked Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to be a traitor to support the demonetisation
 akhilesh-maaya kaa virodh rahaa tha vifaikhilesh yadav, mayawati ne notebandi ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaai thi
 In every election rallies in UP, both leaders spoke out against demonetisation
 akhilesh ke pita mulaayam singh yadav sahit parivaar ke logon par aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle hone ke chalate logon kaa vishwaas nahin jeet paae
 He also had to bear the brunt of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections
 aisa hi haal kuch mayawati kaa bhi rahaa
 His brother Anand Kumar also has a disproportionate assets case, which is also under investigation
 iske alaava notebandi ke baad bispi ke khate main jamaa karai gai moti rakam bhi saarvajanik ho gai
 Due to this, opposing Mayawati failed
 rahul ke gusse par baari kanfusionarahul gandhi ne notebandi ko modi sarkaar par hamale ke liye istemaal karne kii koshish kii
 He accused the government of benefiting his corporate friends, driving away Vijay Mallya and harassing the poor farmers but the BJP was cautious about his attack and after every allegation, BJP spokespersons came back in the media
 congress ke liye asahaj sthiti tab ho gai jab rahul ne bayaan diya ki notebandi ke faisle ke bare main khud vitt mantri arun jetali ko bhi nahin pataa tha
 The BJP accused Rahul of being confused by this statement
 kyonki isse pehle rahul kah chuke the ki piem ke is faisle ke bare main unke corporate doston ko pataa tha
 Opposition unity The Opposition had a chance to show its unity in the Winter Session of Parliament regarding the flopnotation
 is dauraan vipaksh sansad ke donon sadanon ko thap karne main to kaamyaab rahaa lekin usamen koi ekta nahin ban pai jisase wo sarkaar ke khilaaf koi bada andolan ched sake
 Even on 28 November 2016, when the talk of banning India regarding demonetisation came to the fore, the opposition appeared divided
 congress ne ise mahaj janaakrosh diwas ke rup main manaaya
 Nitish Kumar's JDU had also refused to participate in the protests
 mamata ne virodh march nikaala or kejariwal bhi band ke samarthan main nahin dikhe
 Overall, the ruling BJP was given a chance to pinch the opposition
 aaj jab notebandi ke ek saal puure ho chuke hai tab vipaksh ke haath is mudde ko lekar zyada kuch nahin he
 Students graduating from Delhi University's School of Open Learning (SOL) will also have to study syllabus with a regular course
 philhal donon kaa silebus alag-alag he
 The university has formed a committee for this
 is cameti kii report ko academic council or agjicutive council kii meeting main manjuuri ke liye pesh kiya jayega
 a committee has also been formed for Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) in SOL
 campus of open larning ke diarector pro sies dube ne kaha, 'ujisi ke dystence ajukeshan beuro ne SOL corcej ko lekar do sawaal uthaae the jisamen unhone kaha tha ki SOL corcej ke silebus ko regular corcej ke baraabar laayaa jaae tathaa SOL main bhi CCE kaa process lagu ho
 It mainly states that the internal assessment process of regular students should also be applied to SOL students
 donon cametiyaan in muddon par apni report pesh karengi
 It may be noted that while the semester system was implemented for regular students later, SOL still has an annual system
 philhal SOL main semester lagu nahin hoga lekin course main badlaav kiye jaaenge
 Brokers are once again active in the state's largest government hospital, Patna Medical College
 marijon kii jaan ke in saudagaron par lagaam kasne ke liye aspataal prashasan ne immergency ward main sisitivi kaa sakht paharaa to baithaaya he, lekin apni chaalaaki se ye dalal suraksha chakravyuuh ko bhedane main kaamyaab ho ja rahe hai
 The cleverness of these brokers should not get caught by anyone, so now they are getting themselves admitted to the hospital
 marij banakar aspataal main jane ke peeche in dallalon kaa makasad he apni pahchaan chhipaana or pareshaan or garib marijon ko barglaana
 In fact, complaints were being received by the hospital administration for several days of hijacking of brokers in the hospital emergency ward, after which CCTV cameras were installed in the emergency ward to clamp down on these touts, so that their actions could be revealed
 haalanki, apana swaarth saadhane ke liye ye dalal marij banakaaspatalmen bhartee ho jate hai
 They charge a fat commission
 Obviously, the business of these brokers sitting as a patient in the hospital is not coming in anyone's eyes
 idhar, aspataal parisar ke baahar bhi dalal teji se sakriy hai
 The pimples posted outside the hospital premises keep an eye on the medicine slip in the hands of the patients
 parchi par najar padate hin ye marijon ke peeche lag jate hai or phir unhen apane manapsand dukaan tak le jane or phir waapas pahunchane main inkaa motaa kamishan bana lete hai

 com / lfsez1tjfy— wabetainfo (@wabetainfo)december 15, 2016 Timing for some things to happen is so excellent that even the 'conditions', as if Virat Kohli's best cover drive, have brought you across the border or far beyond! Something similar happened with the 25-year-old all-rounder of Mumbai Shivam Dubey (shivam Dubey fetched 5 CR INR) in the IPL auction (IPL Auction2019) held in Jaipur on Tuesday
 mumbai kaa yah olerounder kaaphi din se charchaaon main tha, lekin kisi ko bhi yah ummid nahin thi ki sivam dube itani badi rakam jhatak lenge
 Twenty five times its base price of Rs 20 lakh
 vastav main ravivaar tak bhi koi aisa maanakar nahin chal rahaa tha, lekin somvaar or mangalvaar ke bich kuch aisa hua, jisane sivam dube kii keemat kaa suchakank ekadam se bahut zyada upar chalaa gaya
 Most experts were assuming that the price that Shivam would get would be between two and two and a half crores, but in the end it stopped at five crores
 Why didn't pick the Shivam dubey in our squad KXIP @lionsdenkxip@klrahul11pic

 donon ko jameendaar sahab ke puraane mandir ke ird gird kii jameen khodni he, kuch purana chipa he vahaan
 Excavation goes on
 mitti kii bhi or dilon kii bhi
 Pakhi falls in love with Varun and after some hesitation Varun falls in love with Pakhi
 is dauraan peeche se bade gulam ali khan kii aawaaj main aajaa balam paradesi bajataa rahata he
 But then one day the soil completely goes away
 gaddha ban jaataa he or donon kaa pyaar bhi usee main gir gum ho jaataa he
 It is learned that both he and some of his companions were from a gang of old idols and antique goods
 unhone murti bhi churaai or baap-beti kaa bharosa bhi
 The second half begins
 paakhi biimaar he
 He has TB uske papa mar chuke hai
 Police are behind Varun Gang
 ye sab ho rahaa he dalhousie main
 Where Pakhi's life is as much as the leaves of a falling tree
 tabhi vahaan varun aata he
 And after this the love story filled with grief, compassion and humidity gets thickened
 twachaa ke namb ho chuke hisse main sihari si chhuan jaisaa kuch he yahaan par
 And finally he is the one who makes any love not fun but memorable
 ab kuch critic vaale comentjaisa maine pehle kaha, sonakshi ne bahut acchhee acting kii he
 In the second half, without makeup, she is really sick and at the same time, she is hot in love fever
 ranvir kaa role is tarah se rachaa gaya he ki uski tone first half main down rahe
 He speaks in a slow voice
 second half main unke bolne ko bahut kam he, body lagvange khub bolti he
 The rest are also people
 magar ye film inhen donon kii he
 Music also demands solace like a film
 amit trivedi aasapaas kii chizon se kuch uthaate hai, unhen bhav kii hawa main chhod dete hai
 They fly like light paper
 or nami se unki syaahi geeli hokar kuch kuch banaati rahati he
 The music of the film does not stop the acting and the story anywhere and it is a very important and good thing for the Hindi films
 kahani o henry kii last lif se chavanni se bhi kuch kam inspired he
 The rest is as much
 vah kasi hui he
 But this tightness is not of Bhagam Bhag
 kai seen hataae ja sakate the, magar aisa hote hi film kaa ishwar jo ishk kehalaata he, mar jaataa yaa kamjor ho jaataa
 Because it gets beauty from fine details
 vikramaditya ne apni kaabiliyat ke paudhe main ek nai pattee jod lee he
 Listen to some scene and some love story is like a body
 or sharir kaa koi ek hissaa hota he, jahaan par ungali rakhte hi, thartharaahat hone lagati he or saare indriya bodh jaag jate hai
 To find it, film makers sometimes hover the camera on the lips, sometimes on the eyes
 kabhi baalo par to kabhi gaalon par
 In Lootera, it is a moment of shivering, drying and in the same order, when Pakhi and Varun whisper and talk
 ve baat karte hai or aapke kaan jagate hai
 But then something breaks, and all stops
 second half main ye phir shuru hota he
 This time, not all picture frames are beautiful
 magar isiilie zyada asal or apana he
 This time there are whispers, then you understand that even these grueling chippies are a melodious noise
 toton kii chahak se ubharta shor
 In which someone lives

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter england ke tej gendbaaj fred truman ne jab pehali baar test cricket main 300 wicket liye the to unhen laga tha ki is mukaam par pahunchnaa kisi bhi anya gendbaaj ke liye mushkil hoga lekin muthaiya muralidharan unhen milon peeche chhodkar 800 wicket ke jaadui ank ko chhukar nayaa itihaas rachaa
 After completing 300 wickets, Truman said, "any bowler will be very tired by the time he gets here
" ’’ tab vah sahi the kyonki 1877 ke baad shuru huetest cricket main kisi bhi gendbaaj ke liye 100 wicket tak pahunchnaa kisi khwab ke puure ho jane se kam nahin tha
 However, Truman's record was broken in 1976 and after that many bowlers reached not only 300 but 400 and Muralitharan has now created a new place in front of him
 muralidharan pichley 18 saal se test match khel rahe hai or sanyog se unhone apane antim test match main is jaadui sankhya ko chuaa
 This magical start of wickets in Test matches started with the match played between England and Australia in 1877
 vah 15 march 1877 kaa din tha jab england ke ellen hill ne austrailia ke nait thamsan ko out karke test cricket main gendbaajon ke bich ek duusare se aage badhane or ek naye mukaam tak pahunchane kii hode shuru kii thi
 Nearly 20 years later, England's Jani Briggs became the first bowler in the world to take 100 wickets
 unhone apane karier main 33 test main 118 wicket lekar nayaa ricard banaaya tha
 Australia's leg-spinner Clary Grimmett made the record for taking 200 wickets for the first time in Test cricket
 newjiland main janma yah spinner 1914 main chhuttiyaan manaane ke liye austrailia gaya tha or vahiin kaa hokar rah gaya
 He took 216 wickets in 37 Test matches in his career
 grimet kaa ricard 1953 main england ke tej gendbaaj alek bedsar ne todaa jabaki england ke bryan statham ne 1963 main apane hamawatan gendbaaj ke ricard ko apane naam kiya, lekin in donon main se koi bhi 300 wicket ke mukaam par nahin pahunch paaya jise tab bahut hi mushkil aankada mana jaataa tha
 Fred Truman broke Statham's record in March 1963, and two years later he became the first bowler in the world to touch the magical mark of 300 wickets
 unke baad is mukaam par pahunchane vaale duusare gendbaaj westeindies ke spinner lans gibs the jinhone 1976 main truman kaa ricard todaa tha
 Australia's Dennis Lillee also took the feat of taking 300 wickets after five years and reached his record of 355 wickets
 england ke ian batham ne 1986 main unke ricard ko bhang kiya lekin unke viketon kii sankhya 102 test match main 383 par tham gayi
 Courtney Walls of the West Indies also left no stone unturned to prove Truman wrong, as he was also a fast bowler like Truman but he was the first to show 500 Test wickets
 vals ne 17 march 2001 ko dakshin africa ke khilaaf port spain main yah sankhya chhui or kul 132 test match main 519 wicket liye
 Walls broke this record by Muralitharan in 2004, a few days later, Shane Warne made it to his name
 austrailia ke is diggaj leg spinner ne sabase pehle 600 or 700 test wicket lene kaa kitiman banaaya
 He took 600 wickets in Test cricket against England in August 2005 and then took his 700th wicket by dismissing Paul Collingwood of England in Melbourne on 26 December 2006
 warn ne 145 match 708 wicket liye
 Muralitharan broke his record against England in Kandy in his 116th match 2007-08 and has now managed to reach 800 wickets, reaching where he is currently not seen in any other bowler

 apana faisla sunaate hue supreme court ne kaha ki balaatkaar samaaj ke kilaaf ek aparaadh he, ye do pakshon ke bich kaa maamla nahin he jo aapas main sulah kar len
 The court cannot know whether such a reconciliation is genuine - because the victim may be forced to reconcile under pressure or in an attempt to avoid a lifetime of shock
 court ne kaha, stri kaa sharir uskaa apana mandir hota he
 a woman's dignity is an unbreakable part of her soul that cannot be stained

 While delivering its verdict, the Supreme Court said that rape is a crime against the society, it is not a matter between two parties which should be reconciled
 adaalat ye nahin jaan sakati ki aisi sulah vaastavik he- kyonki peedit dabaav main yaa jivan bhar ke sadame se bachane kii koshish main sulah ko majaboor ho sakati he

 After September 2018, the issue is being discussed all around after the statement of Election Commissioner OP Rawat regarding holding simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in the country
 'ajtak' ne bhi desh main ek saath chunaavon par kuch rajanetaaon kii pratikriya lene kii koshish kii
 We welcome, but this is not so easy
 On the issue of elections, BJP leader GVL Narasiman said, "we have always been in favor of one country one election
 kyonki isse chunaav main kharch kam hota he or usamen paardarshita aegi
 Elections run in some state in the country throughout the year

 This has been discussed in the Parliamentary Committee
 is par chunaav ayog agar sabhi dalon ke saath charchaa karte hai to ham uskaa swaagat karte hai

 But we are ready to fight against Modi government in the election field

 It requires double the machines
 32 lakh saal bhar main
 Achieving 16 lakh now will be the same achievement
 iviem ke saath ab to vivipat bhi chahie
 "speaking further on the elections together, he said," If the Election Commission gives elections simultaneously, if the Assembly is dissolved in the medium term? It should also have proper system in the constitution
 tab kaise kaam chalegaa? baar-baar chunaav kai baar loktantr ke liye bhi acha hota he
 There is moral pressure on governments

" ’’ Bangladesh's all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan said on the incident when Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni faced the umpire in an IPL match that he could understand it as he did the same in the Nidahas Trophy against Sri Lanka 13 months ago
 
 aisa sambhavat: pehali baar hua jab ‘captain kool’ ne apana aapa khoyaa or ampire ulhas gandhe ke faisle ko chunauti dene dagout se nikalakar maidan par aa gaye
 During the match, the fielders escaped the ban despite arguing with the umpire but were fined 50 percent of the match fees
 shaakib ne ravivaar ko dilli capitals ke khilaaf khele jane vaale match kii purv sandhya par kaha, ‘maine nidahaas trophy main aisa hi kiya tha
 i cannot react to this
 ’ nidahaas trophy main srilanka ke khilaaf match ke dauraan nobal nahin dene kaa virodh karte hue shaakib ne khilaadiyon ko maidan se baahar aane ke liye kah diya tha lekin baad main unhone apana man badal liya
 Shakib compared this incident to Dhoni's argument and said, 'it happened suddenly and it shows how obsessed you are with cricket
 aap apni team ke liye kisi bhi tarah se jeet hasil karnaa chaahate he
 'let me tell you that Mahendra Singh Dhoni entered the field in the 25th match of the current IPL season against Rajasthan Royals and he was heard with the umpires
 dhoni isisi kii aachaar samhita ke ulanghan ke doshi paae gaye jiske baad un par match fees kaa 50 pratishat jurmaana lagaaya gaya
 Was this the whole case? It was because after the dismissal of Mahendra Singh Dhoni on the third ball of the last over of the match between Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals, Chennai needed 8 runs in 3 balls to win
 dhoni ke out hone ke baad mishael centner ballebaaji ke liye aae
 At the time, Rajasthan Royals bowler Ben Stokes was bowling
 ben stokes ne is over kii chauthi gend mishael centner ko daali jis par unhone daud kar 2 ran le liye
 At that time, Ben Stokes was given the ball by the on-field umpires, but then immediately withdrew the decision
 is faisle ke baad dhoni itane naaraaz ho gaye ki vah maidan main ghus aae or bich maidan par ampiron ke saath unki kahasuni hui
 Bawal happened on this ball because Chennai said that this ball was above the waist and hence should have been termed no ball
 isi kaaran dhoni bhi maidani ampiron se bahes karne ke liye maidan par aa gaye
 But the umpires did not change the decision
 paanchavin gend par santner ne do ran liye
 Four runs were needed to win on the last ball, here the next ball went wide
 ab aakhri gend par teen ran kii darkaar thi centner ne aakhri gend par chakka maar apni team ko jeet dilaai
 But after this Mitchell Sentner hit the last ball for six to give Chennai Super Kings a four-wicket win over Rajasthan Royals
 isse pehle chennai ne ek baar phir shandaar gendbaaji kaa pradarshan karte hue royles ko saat wicket par 151 ranon par roak diya
 The Rajasthan bowlers made Chennai work very hard to achieve this goal, but Chennai lost the target on the last ball, losing six wickets

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 se ain pehle congress ne apana trump card chal diya he
 Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, daughter of UPA President Sonia Gandhi and sister of Congress President Rahul Gandhi, has stepped into politics
 party ne unhen rashtriya mahasachiv banaate hue purvi uttar pradesh kaa prabharee banaaya he
 Now Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is being directly confronted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, as these two veteran leaders of BJP are representing Purvanchal
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi ko maat dene ke liye sapa-basapa ne congress ko alag rakhkar gathbandhan kiya tha
 In such a situation, the Congress has moved its biggest card in the state
 unhen purvanchal kii jimmedaari saunpane ke peeche congress kii sochi samajhi ranneeti he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who holds power at the Center, is a Member of Parliament from Varanasi Lok Sabha seat of Purvanchal
 iske alaava upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath bhi purvanchal se aate hai
 He has been a longtime MP from the parliamentary seat of Gorakhpur and currently holds the power of the state
 bijepi ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi ko varanasi sansadeey seat se utarkar purvanchal main sabhi dalon kaa safaya kar diya tha
 There was only Azamgarh seat where the SP could win
 isi tarah se 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhi narendra modi ne teen dinon tak purvanchal main deraa jamaakar sapa-congress gathbandhan ko bhi dhul chataa di thi
 However, Purvanchal is considered a strong stronghold of Brahmins
 purvanchal kii adhiktar siton par brahman matadaataaon kii khaasi bhoomika rahati he
 The Brahmins were traditionally supporters of the Congress at one time, but after the Mandal movement, they turned to BJP
 baad main brahman matadaataaon ke ek bade hisse kaa jhukaav mayawati kii basapa kii taraf bhi hua or 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main is tabake kaa jhukaav phir bijepi kii ore ho gaya
 It is believed that Priyanka Gandhi has been given the responsibility of Purvanchal as a strategy to unite and bring these same Brahmins to their side in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki, purvanchal ek daur main congress kaa majboot durg hua karata tha
 All areas of Prayagraj, Varanasi, Balrampur, Bahraich, Bhadohi, Phulpur, Kushinagar, Deoria, Mirzapur, Jaunpur, Sultanpur, Faizabad, Gonda, Basti, Siddharthnagar of Purvanchal were once considered as Congress strongholds
 mana ja rahaa he ki isi kile ko phir se durust karne ke liye congress ne priyanka gandhi ko kaman di he

 Businesses and consumers had to pay tax at many levels at many levels
 vahiin desh main ek jagah se duusari jagah saamaan ko le jane par tex kaa mayajaal maujuud tha jiske chalate ek bahi utpaada desh ke alag-alag hisson main alag-alag keemton par bikta tha
 But Modi government took a very tough decision, completely ending this system and this simple tax system was chosen for the country
 arun jetali ne kaha ki modi sarkaar ne sabhi rajyon ko jiesti lagu karne ke liye taiyaar kiya
 For this, the central government promised the states to compensate any loss in revenue after the implementation of GST

 9 percent more tax has been collected
 yah jiesti kii safalataa ke paksh main sabase bada aankada he

 Piyush Goyal said that before GST, the goods used to come from factories in the country with the bill but when the goods reached their target, that bill was torn and thrown away
 isse factory main bana utana saamaan gananaa main nahin aata or rajasav ko nuksaan hota tha
 But now such loss has been stopped with GST

 lekin modi sarkaar ne revenue neutral tex 15 fisadi ke aasapaas nikaala jiske baad jiesti ko lagu karne kaa hausala badha
 Goyal said that at present the tax on most goods and services in the country is at the rate of 18 percent or less

 Traders in Kanpur opposed GST in a unique way
 ye kaarobaari ghantaghar ke paas bharat mata kii murti ke paas ikattha hue or ghantiyaan bajaakar virodh jataayaa
 The placards in hand were telling that they were opposing the flaws of GST
 lekin ghanti or ghadiya ke saath virodh ke peeche unhone ek dilachasp tark diya
 Traders said that a year ago, the Modi government announced the implementation of GST by ringing the bell
 ab wo unke hi tareeke se ghantiyaan bajaakar kah rahe hai ki sarkaar jiesti kii mushkilon or khaamiyon ko dur kare
 Traders complain that raids are still being conducted on traders
 kaha gaya tha ki sabhi saamaanon par jiesti lagaai jaaegi lekin petrol utpaada isse baahar hai
 On completion of one year, the government should fulfill its promise
 gujarat ke surat main bhi jiesti kii saalagirah kaa utsaah nahin dikhaa
 There was disappointment in both diamond and textile traders
 vahiin, coimbatore main bhi jiesti ke pehle janmdin kaa swaagat nahin hua
 The business of small traders has been affected here
 jiesti se badhegaa rajasav: visheshgyek taraf jahaan vyapaaree jiesti kaa virodh kar rahe hai vahiin, udyog or kar visheshgyon ne isaki saraahna kii he

 udyog mandal asocham ke adhyaksh sandip jajodiya ne kaha ki aisi ashankaayen ki jiesti se mahangaai badhegi or udyog kii aapurti shrinkhalaa main baadha aegi, ab dur ho chuki hai
 Whatever increase in prices is due to the pressure of crude oil and food prices
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki nae kar dhaanche se agle teen se chaar saal main kar se jidipi anupaat sudharega
 Halo Tax co-founder Himanshu Kumar said that GST is a big step in the direction of one nation one tax

 Better tax compliance will improve the tax-to-gdp ratio over the next three to four years

 film kaa naam:'het story 3'reatin2
 5 Directors: Vishal Pandyakalakar: Zarine Khan, Daisy Shah, Sharman Joshi and Karan Singh Grover 'hate Story' franchise films are entirely based on their sex appeal
 isse pehle kii do kishton main pauli dam or surveen chawla ne glamer kaa khub tadakaa lagaaya tha or frenchiji ko apane dam par khinch le gai thim
 However, the story of those films was a tale of bold girls who fight with their circumstances and take their revenge on their own and on their own in a male dominated society
 lekin is baar kahani badal gai he or film ke diarector vishaal pandya or riter vikram bhatta ne kahani main har vah masala daalane kii koshish kii he, jisase vah kamyaabi hasil kar sake
 In this affair, the story becomes very natural and the attempt to factor in suspense is not very successful
 vaise frenchiji jis cheez ke liye femes he, yani sex, to vah bharpoor he
 However, with the arrival of Sunny Leone's new song Supergirl in Interval, the atmosphere in the cinema gets more colorful
 kahani main kitna damafilmaki kahani ek kaamyaab bijnesaman sharaman joshi or uski bivi jarine khan kii he
 He is climbing the stairs of success, but at the same time, a man, Karan Singh Grover, knocks into his life and tells him to spend the night with his wife (something like an indecent proposal)
 phir baat bigadati jaati he
 Karan knows his goal and Sharman is his
 kai raaj bune jate hai or kai raaj khulte bhi hai
 But except for two songs, the rest of the songs interrupt the flow of the story
 phir suspence bhi aisa nahin he ki aapako samaj nahin aae
 But it keeps many places tied, but due to being too loose, it also troubles
 kul milakar agar suspence factor ko thodaa or gaharaai se buna gaya hota to film jabardast ho sakati thi
 Star Appeal has entered the unknown world of Kareen Khanneboldness with this film
 film main vah jis bindaas andaaj main sex seen detii hai, unamem vah khubasurat bhi lagati hai or unka mekaover bhi najar aata he
 Although he is still a little raw in acting, but he seems to be successful in the oomph factor for which he was taken
 udhar,daiji shahne bhi apni kaaya or adaaon se role ko kargar banane kii koshish kii he, film main unka hathiyaar bhi sexi andaaj rahaa he
 Overall, if the film keeps it tied, it is because of Zarine and Daisy
 sharaman joshi or karan singh grover kii acting saamaanya he
 Sharman does not freeze with Zarin
 yah frenchiji heroin par focus karti hai to is baar bhi puraa focus jarine or daiji hi hai
 Earn Ki Baat The previous films of 'hate Story' series did well at the box office as films are often of low budget
 is baar bhi film kaa bajet 20-25 karod ru
 Is told between film kii kahani bahut solid nahin he, lekin het story frenchiji ko lekar hip hameshaa zyada hi rahati he
 If youth audiences connect with the film, then the film is not going to be in loss
 
 
 padmavati malik mohammad jaaysi ke prabandh-kavy padmavat kii nayika he
 According to its story, the unique beauty Padmavati was the daughter of King Gandharvasen of Sinhaldesh
 uske paas hiraaman naam kaa tota tha, jo kisi baheliye ke haathon pakadaa gaya or chittod ke raja ratnasen ke yahaan ja pahunchaa
 Hearing the description of Padmavati from Hiraman, Ratnasen disguised the monk and married Padmavati and brought him to Chittor
 udhar, ratnasen dwaara apamaanit jyotishi raghav chetan se padmavati kii sundarataa ke bare main sunakar dilli ke sultan allaudin khilji ne chittod par akraman kar diya
 After failing even after eight years of war, he sent false message of the treaty and imprisoned King Ratnasen by deceit
 ratnasen ko chhodie kii shart thi padmavati
 Padmavati then enlisted the help of gora-badal
 solah sau palakiyaan sajaai gayi or bhes badalakar raja ratnasen ko mukt karaayaa gaya
 On returning to Chittor, when King Ratnasen came to know that King Devpal of the neighboring state of Kumbhalner had sent a love offer to Padmavati through a messenger, he went to Kumbhalner and challenged Devpal to a duel
 is ladaai main devpal ko maut or ratnasen ko jeet hasil hui, par ek ghaav ne baad main uski bhi jaan le lee
 On the other hand, when Khilji attacked again, when there was no way out, Queen Padmavati along with sixteen hundred women jumped into the fire of Jauhar
 padmavat kaa rachanakaal 1521 se 1542 ke madhya mana gaya he, jabaki iskaa khalanaayak khilji 1296 se 1316 tak dilli kii gaddi par rahaa tha
 According to the facts of history, Khilji attacked Chittor in 1303, where the wife of King Ratnasinh was named Padmini
 jaaysi ke kathanak ke itane hi tathy itihaas main milte hai, baaki ko kavi kii kalpana mana gaya
 But the British officer Jequus Tod (1782–1835) told another story in accounts heard from the bards of Rajasthan
 tod ke yahaan ratnasen kaa naam bhim singh he, padmavati kaa naam padmini or uske pita or sinhaladesh ke raja kaa naam gandharvasen kii bajaae hammir he
 Hearing about Padmini's form, Khilji marched on Chittor
 bhayankar yuddh ke baad bhi koi parinaam na nikalne par khilji ne sandhi prastaav bhijwaya ki use bas ek baar padmini kaa rup dekh lene diya jaae
 Thus the war came to a halt and he was shown the image of Padmini in a mirror
 tod ne allaudin ke duusare hamale main rana bhim singh ke apane 11 putron sahit maare jane kii baat kahi he
 Although later researchers in Toad's work have often found faults, another book mirror supports Akbari Tod with some manipulation in the case of Padmavati's story
 jaaysi se kareeb aadhi sadi baad likhi gai aaine akabari main ratnasen kaa hi ullekh he
 Acharya Ramchandra Shukla has explored in detail the history and geography of Jayasi in the great epics of Padmavat
 unke mutabik, "allaudin ke samay kii or ghatnaon kaa bhi jaaysi ko puraa pataa tha
 He has written the name of the country of the Mongols 'harev'
 allaudin ke samay main mongolon ke kai akraman hue the jinamein sabase jabardast hamalaa 1303 main hua tha
 Alauddin ascended Chittor in 1303
 allaudin chittod garh ko ghere hue he, isi bich main dilli se chitthee aati haih"ehi vidhi dheel dinh tab tain! dilli ten aradaasain ain
 Pichhiun Harev Dinhi who is the chair, who now ascended the lamp
 jinh bhuin math gagan tehi laagaa, thane uthe aav sab bhaaga
 Uh Sah Chittur Garh Chhava, here des now Hoi Parava
 "kya ramchandra shukla ke is udhaaharan se yah anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he ki jaaysi apane baaki varnanon man, bhi tathyon ko lekar utane hi durust honge? vaise jahaan tak purvardh ke raja-rani, tote vaale kathasutra kii baat he to shukla or hajariprasad dvivedi, donon ne hi ise prachlit or bahushrut mana he, jisamen kavi ne apane naamon ko feet kiya
 It is also a matter to remember here that in the history of literature, Padmavati is not only the heroine of Malik Muhammad Jayasi
 hajariprasad dvivedi ne is kram main dasvin sadi ke mayur kavi ke padmavati-katha naam ke ek kavy kaa ullekh kiya he, or prithviraj raso main bhi prithviraj kaa ek padmavati se vivaah hota he
 One thing that is common in all these stories in and around Padmavat is the villainy of Khilji
 kya iskaa kaaran vahi he jaisaa khilji ke samakaleen itihaaskaar jiyauddin barani ne likhaa ki "usne faraao (apni krurta ke liye kukhyat misr ke romanpurv shaasha) se bhi kahin zyada nirdosh logon kaa khun bahaya
 "whatever be the truth, it would be better for those earning from Padmavati's story and for those who make a ruckus to remember Ramachandra Shukla rather than the statement of Barney, who wrote," Handwritten copies of Padmavat are mostly in the homes of Muslims
 Has been found in itnaa main anubhav se kahata hum ki jin musalamaanon ke yahaan yah pothee dekhi gai un sabko maine virodh se dur or atyant udaar paaya
 " dilli desh main food security bill lagu karne vaala pehla rajya ban gaya he

 Speaking about the development in the state in Bathinda, Punjab, about two years ago, Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal announced that now days are not far when buses will run on water in Punjab as it is abroad
 tab virodhiyon ne dipti siem sukhbir singh badal ke is bayaan ko majaak main liya or kaha ki sukhbir hawa main baaten kar rahe hai or aisa kuch nahin hone vaala
 When Badal's joke was created on social media, Sukhbir Singh Badal had said in a January 2015 rally that buses will run on water in Punjab in the same way as it runs abroad and Punjab will be the first state in the country to do so
 sukhbir badal ke is elaan ke saath hi vipaksh ke saath-saath soshal media par bhi unki khilli udayi gai or fasebuk va twitor jaisi soshal citon par unhen bahut trol kiya gaya
 After this, Sukhbir Badal's claim that buses will run on water in Punjab became a question of neck and credit
 kareeb 2 saal baad sukhbir badal ne apane is vaade ko puraa karke apane virodhiyon ko jawaab dene kii koshish kii he or punjab main amphybius bas yani sadak or pani donon par chalane vaali bason kii shuruyaat punjab sarkaar kii taraf se kar di gai
 Punjab Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal flagged off these buses on the lake of Harikapatan at Amritsar and started the service to the public
 punjab sarkaar ne somvaar se ye pani main chalane vaali basen pani main utaar di he
 a special track has also been constructed at Harikapatan lake at a cost of crores to lift this bus into the water
 jameen or pani donon par chal sakati he ye basvishesh taur par pani par hi chalane vaali in bason ko amphybius basen kaha jaataa he
 The American company manufactured bus parts in Thailand and assembled in Goa
 ye bas jameen par chalane ke saath hi pani main bhi utar sakati he or kisi choti kishti yaa krooj kii hi tarah pani par chal sakati hai
 This two crore bus will run on the road and also float on the water
 philhal is bas ko amritsar se harikapattan naam ke tourist sthal tak chalaaya jayega
 Harikerathan is a tourist spot near Amritsar, where there is a lake on which water is ready to run this bus
 project par kharch hue kul 10 karod rupedo karod bas par or aath karod harikapattan par is bas ke liye trek banane or is bas project ke anya kharchon par yani kul milakar das karod punjab sarkaar ne is project par kharch kiye hai
 The fare of this bus has been kept at 2000 rupees per person to come and visit Harikepatan, 45 km from Amritsar railway station
 jabaki sirf harikapattan main jhil kii saiyr karne ke liye 800 rupee prati vyakti kharch karne honge
 Punjab was not the first state to run buses on water, Sukhbir Badal claimed that Punjab would be the first state in the country to run buses on water, but before Punjab, these buses have run in Kerala and Goa, but still this project of Punjab government has been called election By starting before, Sukhbir Badal hopes that he will get a lot of benefit in the elections

 Zuckerberg had built this platform dedicated to friendship

 vaise raajnneeti tak to phir bhi sahi he lekin pichley do teen saal main soshal media se jis tarah afvaahon ko failaayaa ja rahaa he wo chintajanak he
 Due to these rumors, 'mob lynching' is now becoming a familiar term
 iske pehle ye 'mob linching' turm aam bharatiyon ke liye lagbhag anjaanaa hi tha
 At least i did Google for the first time after the Dadri lynching of 2015 to know its meaning
 google se hi mujhe pataa chalaa 'mob-linching' kaa arth he, arthath shaq ke aadhaar par kisi ko apradhi maan kar bina kisi sunwaayee ke 'on da spot' faisla sunaate hue jaan le lenaa
 Then from 2015 onwards, on the lines of 'mob lynching' Kaun Banega Crorepati, we became popular among Indians
 shuru-shuru main mob-linching gau-hatya or bif bain ko le kar hua magar ab bacchon ke apharan vaali afvaahen apane charam par he
 Look at the lynching, only 25 people have lost their lives between May 2018 and July 1, 2018
 isi killer linching siries kaa taro-tazaa udhaaharan dhule gaanv he
 Where some people had come to beg, but a news came out on whatsapp that some people have come to the village to kidnap children
 uske baad kya dekhnaa or kya samajhnaa
 The news spread like wildfire and within an hour the crowd surrounded five strangers and kept slapping them with slippers, kicking and kicking sticks until they were dead
 is ghatana se koi haftaa bhar pehle gujarat main ek pantalis saal kii mahila ko bhi baccha chor hone ke andeh main bheed ne peet-peet kar maar daalaa
 Later, it was found out about the woman that she too was a beggar and was begging for her livelihood
 gujarat se pehle assam main bhi do ejineering ke chaatro ko baccha chor hone ke andeh par maar daalaa gaya jabaki wo picnic manaane ke liye ja rahe the
 a similar incident took place in Kerala too where a Hindi-speaking person was killed by the mob as a child thief
 ye to mahaj baangi bhar he
 The value of people's lives is now just a rumor
 koi bhi shaks whatsap yaa fasebuk par ek khabar likh kar post kar detaa he or uske baad forvarding kaa khooni khel shuru ho jaataa he
 Enthusiasts begin to gather at one place as soon as they read the news
 jaise hi ye log bheed kii shakl ikhtyaar kar lete hai unki nazaren kisi ajanabi chehre ko talashne lagati hai, jise unhone shaayad pehle kabhi dekha na ho or jaise hi wo cheharaa mil jaataa he log apana frestration nikalnaa shuru kar dete hai
 On the spot the verdict is heard without any argument of that stranger face
 ab sochane vaali baat ye he ki achaanak se ye mob-linching kaa khel itnaa jor kaise pakadaney laga he? aakhir kami samaaj kii he yaa system kii? koun jimmedaar he in ja rahi jaanon ke liye?news channel khabar dikhaa kar bhul jate hai, netaa bayaan de kar apane ghoslen main aaraam farmaane chale jate hai agali linching ke intjaar main
 Nobody thinks what will happen to the family of the victim of lynching? How will their life go? Those families neither receive any compensation nor any other assistance
 zyada dur jane kii bhi jarurat nahin he abhi kal hi hue mob-linching ke shikaar ki patni apane teen bhukhe bacchon ko god main liye bilakh-bilakh kar ro rahi thi
 She was constantly referring to the hunger of her children with the plea of justice from the government
 kanaabadoshon ke samudaay ki is mahila kaa pati dhule gaanv ke bazaar se bheekh main chaaval or aataa lene gaya tha magar wo lautaa nahin
 This is just one example
 aise kitne hi parivaar honge jinke ghar ke mukhiya ko unmadit bheed ne shaq ke aadhaar par maar daalaa
 For a few days, those families remained in the news, but what happened to them after that, no matter what condition they are in

 soshal cites ke jariye afvaah failaane waalon par sakhti karne kii jarurat he
 And it is necessary that strict punishment should be provided for such people
 ham maan bhi len ki soshal media ke liye riforms banaayen bhi gayi to ek party iske saport main baithegi to duusari virodh main
 There is more selfishness here than country interest
 sab apane-apane agenda ke saath aage bad rahe hai
 Also, the number of unemployed in the country is also increasing day by day, so it is not a big or unique thing to turn these empty minds into a bloody crowd
 bas ham sab ko ab apni-apni baari kaa intjaar karnaa chahie
 Someday, on a road or an intersection, we can also be killed on suspicion

 is jeet ke jashn main mumbai ke vankhede stadium main chal rahe match par kam hi cricket fans kii nazar gai hogi
 But in the ongoing Ranji final in Mumbai, 23-year-old Karun Nair of Karnataka created a new history by scoring an unbeaten triple century
 ranjai final ke tisare din chathe number par khalete hue karun nair ne naabad 310 ranon kii pari khelkar gundappa vishwanath ke 1977-78 main banaae gaye 247 ranon ke record ko peeche chhod diya jo unhone uttar pradesh team ke kilaaf banaae the
 This is the highest score by any batsman in the Ranji final from Karnataka
 yahi nahin apni 815 minute kii pari main karun ne kamaal kaa sanyam dikhaaya he
 If he is able to add ten more runs to his score, then Baroda's Gul Mohammad's 319 runs can break Ranji record
 gul mohammad ne 1946-47 main holkar ke kilaaf ranjai final main 319 ranon kaa record banaaya tha
 The nearly seven-decade-old record is now visible to Karun Nair
 filhal karun nair 310 ranon ke saath apane captain aar vinay kumaar ke saath kries par jame hai, jo naabad 41 ran banaakar note out hai
 It is also important that in this match Nair also completed his double century for the first time
 isse pehle unka sarvaadhik score unki naabad 151 ranon kii pari thi
 In this innings of nearly 13 and a half hours, Karun has so far scored 58
 16 ke strike rate se khelte hue ek chakka or 45 chauke lagaae hai
 Karnataka have so far scored 618 runs, losing 7 wickets against Tamil Nadu's 134 for the first innings
 yani ab tak karnataka ne 448 ranon kii badhat hasil kar lee he

 Researchers at the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute found that three nights a week of good sleep increases insulin activation to a large extent
 insulin jiske na banane se yah beemaari hoti he
 Major Shoredhi Dr
 peter liu ne bataaya ki ham sabhi jaanate hai ki paryaapt neend jaruri he lekin zyada kaam kii vajah se yah puri nahin ho paati
 Study We found that increasing sleep hours increases the body's ability to use insulin and reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes in older individuals
 insulin kisi vyakti ke rakt main sharkara ke str ko niyamit karne ke liye mukhya rup se jimmedaar he
 Liu said that the good news is that older people who are not able to get enough sleep due to overwork can increase this risk if they increase the hours of sleep

 disidablyoo chif trilokapuri ke paas sthit chilla gaanv main bane shauchalay kaa nirikshan karne pahunchi to pataa chalaa ki ye shauchalay dilli nagar nigam kaa he
 In this toilet, a person was coming out of the toilet made for women, while the toilet made for men was closed
 raat ke samay is shauchalay ko band kar diya jaataa he
 Antisocial elements drink alcohol in this toilet at night
 iske baad swati jaihind chilla gaanv ke duusare chor par bane shauchalay kaa nirikshan karne pahunchi
 This toilet was also found closed
 is shauchalay kaa rakrakhaav bhi nagar nigam dwaara kiya jaataa he
 There was a shortage of staff in these toilets, due to which there was a lot of dirt
 iske baad disidablyoo chif trilokapuri ke block 27 main bane shauchalay kaa nirikshan karne pahunchin
 This toilet was closed and was never opened
 aage badhate hue sanjay cap main bane shauchalay kaa bhi disidablyoo chif ne nirikshan kiya
 This toilet belonged to Delhi Correctional Shelter Board
 yahaan bane shauchalay main gandagi thi or vahaan maujuud chaukeedaar ne bataaya ki raat ke samay aawaara kism ke log yahaan aa jate hai jo lutpaat karte hai, isliye vah shauchalay band kar detaa he
 Finally the DCW Chief inspected the toilet built at Indra Cap
 yah shauchalay bhi band padaa tha
 They found that these toilets have a slum area and because of the closure of the toilets, women have to go to the toilets on the road and have rape incidents with them
 raat ke kareeb 3 baje shauchalay kaa nirikshan karne ke baad ayog kii adhyaksh waapas apane aphis main aa gai
 It is worth noting that the Satyagraha of the President of the Delhi Commission of Women has been going on for the last four days to demand a draft from the governments to get the death penalty for the rapists of the little girls within 6 months
 disidablyoo chif din-raat kaam karke apana satyagrah kar rahi hai
 For the last four days, she has not gone home, instead visiting the office during the day and at night, registering her protest
 band shauchalayon par dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh swati jaihind ne kaha ki raat ke samay hi adhiktar mahilaayein gharon se nikalakar saarvajanik shauchalayon main jaati hai or raat ke samay hi shauchalay band kar die jate hai
 He said that on the one hand, a campaign is going on at the national level to stop open defecation in the country, while the toilets are closed in the capital of the country
 aise main ye abhiyaan sirf jumale banakar rah jaaenge
 DCW Chief Swati Jaihind said that they are preparing a report on the closed toilets that will be sent to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and the Government of Delhi to open the toilets at night and keep them clean
 6 oktober ko azamgarh main hone vaali mulaayam singh yadav kii raily ko party ne philhal radd kar diya he
 However, no reason has been given to postpone Mulayam Singh Yadav's rally before the election
 jaankaron ke mutabik party ke bheetar machi andruni kalah or baghawat ke dar se party ne philhal mulaayam ki ye raily taal di he
 In Azamgarh, socialist Partikai has split into Khemo and there has been infighting within the party in the district unit
 party ko dar he ki kahi is baghawat kaa asar chunaav kii is shankhanaad raily par hi na dikhaai de
 Let me tell you that Mayawati had a big rally in Azamgarh and made her realize her strength
 aise main agarmulaayam kii reliflop hoti to party ke manobal par asar padataa
 Sensing the same, Samajwadi Party has decided to postpone this rally for the time being
 mulaayam kii ye raily usee itiai maidan par honi thi, jahaan mayawati ne apni sarvajan hitay sarvajan sukhaay raily kii thi
 Mulayam Singh himself is an MP from Azamgarh and in some sense a bad rally from Mayawati could have overshadowed him politically

 ve mere liye adarsh hai jo mujhe mehnat se aage badhane kii prerana dete hai na ki nakal karke
 While composing music, like these unique people, there should be original imagination and different style
 donon mulkon ke sangeet kii baat karen to bhartiya sangeet mukhya rup se yahaan ke film udyog se panpa he
 Here the music of the songs is based on the demand of the film and the singers sing those songs according to the demand of the music director and the scenes

 The police is raising a lot of suspicion behind the incident everywhere that only a member of the house is behind these incidents, or are the women themselves not cutting their peaks?

 The Congress lodged a strong objection to the issue
 congress kii ore se anand sharma ne point of order kaa hawala dete hue upasabhapati se bhupendra yadav kii is tippanee ko record par na jane dene kii apil kii
 After discussing the budget, Bhupendra Yadav termed it as the blueprint of public interest schemes of the government
 sapa-tiemasi ne uthaae sawalsapa saansad vishmbhar prasad nishad ne kendriya bajet ko lekar sarkaar par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 The MP said that the government has announced all kinds of schemes but they will only encourage black marketing and bribery
 sarkaar ko jameen hakeekat ke bare main kuch bhi pataa nahin he bas netagan jhuthe vaade or jumale de rahe hai
 He said that this government has completely failed in dealing with important issues like employment, health, inflation
 tiemasi ke saansad maanas ranjan bhuniya ne badt par charchaa ke dauraan apane sambodhan main kaha ki sarkaar ne yojanaon kaa elaan kiya he lekin uske liye paisa kahaan se aayega ye is bajet main nahin bataaya he
 He said that from where the government will bring funds for Ayushman Bharat scheme, Finance Minister should tell about this to the House

 Bhunia was delivering his first address in the House
 renuka maamle par hangaamaarajyasabha main buudhvaar ko bhaashan ke dauraan pradhanmantri narendra modi ne congress ke kai netaaon ko nishaanaa banaaya
 Meanwhile, there was an occasion when in response to his statement, when Congress MP Renuka Chaudhary started laughing loudly, Chairman Venkaiah Naidu also expressed his displeasure, but Modi stopped Naidu and said, "speaker, you have to give something to Renuka Say no ramayana serial ke baad aisi hansi ab sunai di he
 After this statement of Modi, there was a lull in the house and Renuka's objection was buried in those laughter
 renuka yahi kahati raheen ki pradhanmantri kehete hai ki wo mahilaon kaa sammaan karte hai lekin mahilaon par is tarah kii tippanee kii ja rahi he
 Congress MP Kumari Selja, reacting to the pm's remarks, said that this is the culture of the BJP and the thinking of the PM
 unhone kaha ki piem modi ne sirf congress kii varisht saansad or purv mantri kaa apmaan nahin kiya balki yah ek mahila kaa bhi apmaan he or unhen iske liye maafee maangani chahie
 The Finance Minister will reply that the budget session that starts from January 29 will end on Friday

 bijepi ne bijli mudde ko lekar kaarysthgan prastaav diya tha, jise adhyaksh ne naamanzoor kar diya
 Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Nandkishore Yadav said that the opposition is seeking answers from the government on the problems of the people, but the government is not ready to answer
 sarkaar ne shaharon main 24 ghante or gaanvon main 15-16 ghante bijli dene kii baat kahi thi, lekin shaharon main hi paryaapt bijli nahin mil rahi he
 Seeing the BJP uproar, the Speaker adjourned the house till 2 pm

 You will be charged for calling from Jio on other networks
 Know here all the talk related to Jio's new decision, you will now have to pay for calling on other networks
 jeeyo se jeeyo network par colling free rahegi, lekin kisi duusare network par colling ke liye yugers ko 6 paise prati minute kii dar se bhugtan karnaa hoga
 Jio has said that from now on customers will have to get an IUC top-up recharge for calling from Jio to other networks
 ab tak keval data ke liye richarge karana hota tha or colling or SMS kii seva free milti thi
 For your information, let us enter Jio in the telecom sector on 5 September 2016
 tab se lekar ab tak company colling kii sevaayen free de rahi thi
 Understand about IUC, IUC means to understand the interconnect usage charge, the fact is that the company has to pay the fees fixed by TRAI for calling from one telecom network to another
 aise main jis network se duusare network main outgowing kol kiye jate hai, use saamne vaale network ko IUC fees dena padataa he
 IUC is the reason for Jio's new decision because telecom companies have to pay on the basis of calls made on each other's network
 aise main agar sabhi networks main kol kii sankhya agar baraabar ho to bhugtan kii rakam baraabar ho jaati he
 But the balance deteriorates when more calls are made from one network to another and only one network has to pay more IUC charge
 kyon laga charge?trai kii ore se 2017 main IUC charge 6 paise prati minute tay kii gai thi or kaha gaya tha ki 1 janvari 2020 tak ise khatm kar diya jayega
 Then the company had kept the calling free
 lekin haal hi main tri ne rivyuu ke liye aiusi se judaa kansaltesan paper maanga he or isaki avadhi badhaai ja sakati he
 For this reason, after increasing pressure, Jio has decided to stop free calling
 philhal jeeyo ne kaha he ki ye ek asthai kadam he or IUC ke khatm hote hi colling ko phir se free kar diya jayega
 What are the new plans? Currently calling on Jio's network and landline is free
 lekin agar aap jeeyo ke network se kisi duusare network par kol karnaa chaahate hai to ab aapako alag se IUC top-ap vauchar se richarge karnaa hoga
 Its starting price is 10 rupees
 jeeyo kii ore se chaar nae plance pesh kiye gaye hai
 Along with this recharge, you will also get additional data
 dhyaan rahe aapako duusare network par colling ke liye 6 paise prati minute kii dar se bhugtan karnaa hoga
 Let us tell you that these new top up vouchers will be apart from the monthly plans
 yani ise aise samajhen ki aap agar 149 rupee kaa manthali plan yuj karte hai to ab aapako jeeyo ke network se duusare network par kol karne ke liye nae top ap ko khareednaa hoga
 During the hearing of a case reached in the Supreme Court, the judge was also surprised
 supreme courtke jajon kii bench ne nichali adaalat kewotsapake jariye sunwaayee karne par naaraazgi jaahir kii
 The bench said, "is this a joke? In fact, former Jharkhand minister Yogendra Sav and his wife Nirmala Devi are accused in the 2016 riot case
" 15 disambar 2017 ko sheersh adaalat ne unhen jamaanat di thi
 The court had made a condition that they would stay in Bhopal and would not enter Jharkhand except to participate in the court proceedings
 haalanki, hazaribagh kii ek adaalat ne 19 april ko watsap video kol ke jariye unke khilaaf aarope tay kiye or donon aropiyon ko mukademe kaa saamana karne ko kaha
 Taking the plea seriously, a bench of Supreme Court Justice SA Bobde and Justice LN Rao said, 'what is happening in Jharkhand? This process cannot be allowed and we cannot allow the slander of the administration of justice
 ’bench ne jharkhand sarkaar ke vakil se kaha, 'ham yahaan watsap ke jariye mukadmaa chalaae jane kii raah par hai
 This cannot be done
 yah kis tarah kaa mukadmaa he? kya yah majaak he?’ bench ne donon aropiyon kii yachika par jharkhand sarkaar ko notice jari kiya or do saptaah ke bheetar rajya se iskaa jawaab dene ko kaha
 Senior advocate Vivek Tankha, representing the case on behalf of the Sau couple, said that the Bhopal district court and Hazaribagh district court of Jharkhand were instructed to run the case through video conferencing
 tankha ne kaha ki donon jila adaalaton main zyaadaatar video conferencing sampark bahut kharaab rahata he or nichali adaalat ke jaj ne watsap video kol ke jariye 19 april ko aadesh sunaaya
 The counsel for Jharkhand told the court that former minister Sau is violating the conditions of bail and has stayed out of Bhopal for most of the time, due to which the trial hearing is being delayed
 isapar bench ne kaha ki yah alag baat he
 If you have problems with violating the bail conditions of the accused, then you can file a separate application for cancellation of bail
 ham saaf karte hai ki jamaanat kii sharton kaa ulanghan karne vaale logon se hamen koi sahanubhuti nahin he
 The bench asked Tankha how many cases were there against both the accused
 In response, Tankha stated that there are 21 cases against Sau
 jabaki, unki patni ke khilaaf 9 maamle lambit hai
 Both are leaders and have led various protests against the land acquisition by NTPC
 inamen se zyaadaatar maamle un andolanon se jude hai
 Tankha said that since both the accused were mlas at the time these cases were filed
 isliye unke khilaaf in maamalon ko dilli kii special court main transfar kiya janaa chahie, jo netaaon se sambandhit maamalon par khaastaur par vichaar karti he
 Let me tell you that Koegendra Saw and his wife are accused in a case related to violent clashes between villagers and police in 2016
 isamen chaar log maare gaye the
 Sau became a minister in Hemant Soren's government in August 2013
 california kii ek saahsee billi tara in dinon sthaneey logon or utyub par kaaphi mashhoor ho gai he
 Tara has also been honored during a baseball match recently
 darasal, tara ne chaar saal ke bachche ko ek kute se bachaane kaa saahasik kaam kiya he, jabaki aam taur yah dekha jaataa he ki billi khud kute se darati he
 Tara did this feat on May 13, after which the video of the incident captured in the security camera went viral on youtube
 is video ko ab tak 21 million se adhik log dekh chuke hai
 The child injured in the incident, Jeremy, has 10 stitches in his leg, while the cat swooped on him just after the dog attacked
 jeremi ke pita reyaan bataate hai ki unhone video ko edit kiya or use utyub par parivaar or doston ke liye aplod kiya tha
 He did not think that the video would get such an encouragement
 video main cycle chalaa rahe jairemi par ek kutta ghaat lagaakar hamalaa karata he or uske pair ko ghaseetne lagata he
 Then Tara swoops in on the dog and drives her away
 ghar ke sadsy kii tarah he taraghatana ke baad se reyaan ke parivaar ne tara ko apane saath rakh liya he
 Tara is now a part of his family and his wife Erika, along with Ryan, take care of him
 tara ke saahasik kadam ke baad haal hi ek sthaneey besabaal match ke dauraan tara ko match kaa pehla gend phenkane kaa mauka diya gaya
 Although she could not succeed in this, she tried and with the help of Ryan she bounced the ball
 reyaan kehete hai, 'tara ke aane se jeremi ko ek nai dost mil gai he
 He is quite happy
 'video main dekhen kaise billi ne kute ko di maat

 He said that before the announcement of Kovind's name, the opposition parties had thought of making a tribal their candidate

 Therefore, we are also considering landing a tribal person

 5 starpichley dinon sabase zyada charchaa kaa vishay rahi film 'udata punjab' aakhirkaar bahut saare utaar-chadhaav ke bich relies ho chuki he
 How is this film made now? Can you meet your standards? Let's review
 kahanithfilm kii kahani punjab kii prishthbhumi par aadhaarit he, jahaan nashe main dhut rahane waltomi singh (shahid kapur) mashhoor pop singer he
 Because of which many young people want to be like him
 vahiin duusari taraf doctor preet saahani (karina kapur khan) hai, jo nashe ke kaarobaar ko jad se khatm karnaa chaahati he or iske liye uski madad punjab police main kaam karne vaala sartaaj singh (dilajit dosanjh) karata he
 The film also stars a girl (alia Bhatt) from Bihar who gets caught in the clutches of drug dealers for some reason
 ab kya nashe kaa ye kaarobaar khatm ho paaegaa? ye aapako film dekhakar hi pataa chalegaa
 Script: The film's story is designed to draw attention to a particular issue, which is about 'drugs'
 or isi ke ird gird saare kirdaaron ko sajaayaa gaya he
 The film is in a very dark shade, where you get intoxicated everywhere
 real lokshans kii shoot dekhne kaa anand bhi aata he
 The story of the film seems to be quite long in the second half, but is corrected according to the target
 abhinayahfilm ke liye jo shahid kapur ne luk or lahaza liya he wo kamaal kaa he or darshneey bhi he
 Diljit has also done the right thing as a Punjab Police Officer
 karina kapur kaa kirdaar bhi apane role ko bakhub nibhaataa he
 But Alia Bhatt's work, her look and tone is the best, which does not look like she is Alia
 film ke baaki kalakaaron ne bhi sahaj abhinay kiya he
 Weak episode: The issue of the film is correct, but perhaps it may be a bit difficult for the weak hearted as the film has a lot of bad blood along with abusive gulouches
 sangitahfilm kaa sangeet relies se pehle hi super hit he
 The background score also goes well with the story line
 'ek kudi' or 'chitta ve' gane film main jachate hai
 Why watch: If you are a fan of Alia Bhatt, Shahid Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor Khan or Diljit Dosanjh and are inclined to film on serious issues, then definitely watch this film
