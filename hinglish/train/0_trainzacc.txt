 agle saal loksabhaa chunaavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ol india majalis-e-ittehadul muslimin (eiemiem) ne maharashtra kii anusuchit jatiyon main khaasaa prabhaav rakhane vaale bharip bahujan mahasang (bibiem) ke saath chunavi gathbandhan kar liya he
 At a joint rally held in Aurangabad on 2 October to announce the alliance, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi announced that Bhim Rao Ambedkar was indeed a larger leader than Mahatma Gandhi
 unhone kaha ki is dalit mahapurush ne desh ko sabase bada loktantric hathiyaar—samvidhan—diya
 The new coalition is eyeing 13 per cent Dalit and 12 per cent Muslim voters in the state, who together can influence the election results in Aurangabad, Akola, Malegaon and mumbai-south Central, out of the four Lok Sabha seats in the state
 bibiem ke adhyaksh prakaash ambedkar kehete hai ki yah gathbandhan matdaan ke puraane rujhaanon ko badal degaa
 "we have come together to teach the BJP a lesson," he says
 ''lekin isane bhaajapa ke khilaaf ek saajha morcha banane kii congress kii yojana ko bigaad diya he
 State Congress president Ashok Chavan, who clashed with AIMIM as a partner, was hopeful that he would bring BBM with him
 lekin ambedkar eiemiem ke saath gathbandhan ko lekar adig hai or kehete hai ki ve congress ke prastaav par tabhi vichaar karenge jab vah bibiem ko rajya kii 12 siten dene ke liye taiyaar hogi
 Ambedkar dismissed Sharad Pawar as an opportunist and rejected his alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)
 vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki bibiem-eiemiem gathbandhan akola se baahar safal nahin ho paaegaa
 Ambedkar wants to contest from Akola itself
 unka kahana he ki eiemiem ne 2014 main madhya aurangabad or bhaikhla main vidhansabha chunaav jitkar or nanded kii mahanagarapalika main badi kamyaabi hasil karne ke baad uskaa phayda ganvaa diya he
 The party did not get a single seat in the same Nanded Municipal Corporation elections six months ago
 haal hi main ovaisi ne jis tarah vidhayak vaaris pathan se ganesh utsav ke dauraan ganpati kaa naaraa lagane par maafee maangane ke liye jor diya, usase votaron main naaraazgi he
 Certainly this is not going to be an easy election for this alliance
 saamaajik nyaay rajyamantri ramdaas athavle, jinka daliton main acha-khaasaa prabhaav he, kaa kahana he ki bibiem-eiemiem gathbandhan darasal bhaajapa ke liye vardaan sabit hone vaala he kyonki isse voton kaa vibhaajan hoga
 In addition, Maharashtra Muslim Association (MMS), a collective organization of about 50 ngos with 2 crore members, considers AIMIM as 'outsider'
 iske adhyaksh fakir mohammad thakur kehete hai, ''hamen sthaneey netaaon kii jarurat he
 On the other hand, the BJP camp sees the BBM-AIMIM alliance as a great opportunity to strengthen its party's KOBC base
 sattadhari party pehle se hi obisi ke liye rajya sarkaar ke vibhinn kaaryakramon par jor dene kii yojana bana rahi he
 Even the Shiv Sena feels that this will benefit the BJP
 shivasena ke netaa sanjay raut kehete hai, ''bhaajapa ne khud hi yah gathbandhan banwaaya he taaki vah vipakshi voton main send laga sake
 "the impact of AIMIM has declined since 2014: The party did not get a seat in the Nanded metropolitan municipality six months ago
" *** On the one hand, the central government has enacted a new death sentence for rape of minor girls, whereas in Odisha, a case has come up in which the panchayat was engaged in raping the minor girl with rape
 
 aakhirkaar jab peedita garbhvatee ho gai to parijanon ne police main cese darj karavaaya

 divyang bacchee se rape kaa maamla saamne aane ke baad gaanv ke log panchayat ke jariye rafa-dfa karnaa chaahate the
 But even after 4 months, the panchayat did not take any action against the accused person
 is bich peedit bacchee bhi garbhvatee ho gai to parijanon ne police kii sharan lee
 Let us tell you that a sensational case of rape was reported by a priest from Dhamtari district of Chhattisgarh with a disabled girl
 dhamtari shahar ke kotwali thana kshetra main sthit ram mandir parisar main nivas karne vaale ramashankar vaishnav (28) par ek divyang yuvati (24) ne rape kaa aarope lagaaya he
 On the evening of 24, the victim was going back home from computer class
 usee vakt vaishnav ne usase kaha ki uski maa mandir main he
 The victim says that after this the priest took her to her house, where she suddenly fainted
 jab use hosh aayaa to khud pujari ne use bataaya ki uske saath rape hua he
 Police officials said that the woman was frightened by the incident
 usne jab apane parijanon ko ghatana kii jaankaree di tab ve log use lekar thaan aae
 a case was filed against accused Vaishnav here
 police ne yuvati kii shikaayat ke aadhaar par cese darj karte hue vaishnav ko giraftar kar liya he
 The matter is being investigated
 april maheene main hi bihar ke siwan jile se ek divyang naaballig bacchee se rape kii dahala dene vaali ghatana saamne ai
 The incident is from Siwan's sparrow
 police ne bataaya ki aaropee bhi naaballig he, jise ghatana ke agle hi din giraftaar kar liya gaya

 According to the police, the accused young man took the minor girl to her house and after raping her, left the victim back at her home
 sarkaar ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki bhoomi adhigrahan or punarvaas tathaa punasrthaapan vidheyak kaa masauda taiyaar kar liya he or is par vibhinn pakshon se raay maangi gai he
 Minister of State for Rural Development Shishir Kumar Adhikari gave this information to the Rajya Sabha in written reply to the questions of Captain Singh Solanki
 unhone bataaya ki bhoomi adhigrahan kaa kisaanon par padane vaale pratikul prabhaavon ko kam karne ke liye masauda vidheyak main kai upbandh shaamil kiye gaye hai
 Author: Hakan Gundaprakash: Yatra Books, Translation Council of India Price: 295 Rupeescover: The paperback paper which the magazine picked up, only discusses the books of select publishers
 ek to media main sahitya kaa spes simatata ja rahaa he, duusare us simatate spes main bhi charchaa kuch ‘khaas’ thappon vaali kitabon tak simatati ja rahi he
 The result is that we do not know the publication of many good or important books
 kuch kaa pataa fasebuk aadi se chal jaataa he, kaiyon kaa vahaan bhi nahin
 For example, i would not have known about the unique books of Turkey, if i had not got the unique gift of four books from the travel books
 ye chaaron kitaaben turki ke lekhakon kii hai, un lekhakon kii jo vahaan ke lokapriy, charchit lekhak hai
 i will try to write these books in turn
 sabase pehle aaj jis upanyaas kii charchaa karne ja rahaa hum vah he 2011 main turki ke sarvshereshth upanyaas ke rup main puraskrit upanyaas ‘dafn hoti jindagi’, lekhak hai haakaan gunde
 Manisha Taneja, a Spanish language scholar who researches Marquez's novel 'one Hundred Years of Solitude', translates it under research, through English to help us reach it in a simple, simple language
 turki main do tarah ke upanyaas khub likhe or padhe jate hai
 On one hand, crime stories are written and read a lot, such novels which are called thrillers in English
 duusare, vaise upanyaas jinke ek adarsh model ke rup main main orhan paamuk ke upanyaas ‘snow’ ko dekhtaa hum
 That is, the story of the struggle of fundamentalist Islamic organizations in a 'liberal' society
 aise kathanak ‘west’ ke pathakon ko khub pasand aate hai, jo unke saamne islam kii ek barbar chhavi pesh karata he
 In the era of 'struggle for civilizations', Western society is able to present its superiority by calling Islam as fanatical, barbaric, medieval thinking
 aise kathanak ko aadhaar banaakar likhe gaye upanyaason ko ek bada pathak varg miltaa he, inaam ikraam milane kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 This novel by Hakan Gunde is a novel of this second category
 ek derda he jiskaa vivaah 11 saal kii umr main ek shaikh ke bete se kara diya jaataa he
 There is an incident in the novel that when the convoy of Sheikh's vehicles in the village comes to the village to like the girl, the kind of atmosphere shown in the village reminds me of Barabas Sagar Sarhadi's 'bazaar', In which one of the Gulf money middle aged comes to Hyderabad to like a girl so that she can be married
 hode much jaati he ki vah meri ladki kharid le, vah meri ladki kharid le
 Nonetheless, Darda is married and taken to London, where she lives like a prisoner for five years in an apartment where she has no work except to calm her man's lust
 ek din vah vahaan se bhaag nikalati he
 She becomes addicted to heroin
 eni naam kii ek aurat use duusari jindagi detii he
 She is a nurse by profession, but keeps Darda like her daughter
 uski jindagi badal jaati he
 There are many such lives
 turki ke liye pyaar he
 There are intricacies of his society
 jivan ke utaar-chadhaav hai
 Amidst the crumbling walls of religion is the light of humanity that keeps everyone connected
 isamen koi shaq nahin he ki islam ke naam par hone vaale atyaachaar ko centre banaakar likhe gaye is upanyaas kaa euaspy yahi he ki islam kattarta badhaata he, dooriyaan paidaa karata he, dharm ke naam par insaani jindagiyon ko dafn kar detaa he
 But there is no doubt that Hakan Gunday has added to the tales of crime fiction, the intricacies, the chemistry of human relationship emotion that you are immersed in the mysterious world of the novel
 shukriya yatra books
 Above all, thank you Manisha Taneja for delivering this novel through easy translation in our language! You may read, many pre-made previews will be strong, but believe me many will break

 President's rule has come into force in Maharashtra for the next 6 months

 Today, a team of Congress leaders reached NCP chief Sharad Pawar to discuss the formation of the government
 ek daur kii charchaa ke baad ensipi or congress ne sanyukt press conference kar apana rukh spasht kiya or kaha ki pehle ham aapas main baat karenge uske baad hi shivasena se baat hogi
 According to information received from Congress sources, the Congress has placed its conditions on joining the government in Maharashtra
 congress chaahati he ki agar vah sarkaar main shaamil hoti he to use sammajanak or lagbhag barabari kii hissedari mili or cabinet kaa bantwaaraa bhi teenon dalon main samaan rup se ho
 This is the reason why Ahmed Patel, the chief troublemaker of Sonia Gandhi, reached Mumbai

 iskaa matlab he ki sarkaar main 42 cabinet mantri rakhe jaaen or unhen teen bhaagon main baant diya jaae
 That is, the accounts of NCP, Shiv Sena and Congress each party should be included in the government of 14 cabinet ministers
 iske saath hi congress kii taraf se is baat kaa bhi dabaav he ki cabinet ke grih or rajasav jaise mahatvapurn vibhaag eemaandaaree ke saath teenon dalon ke bich baante jaaen

 argedy kii iftaar party main bijepi saansad shatrughna sinha pahunche to puure lalu parivaar kaa cheharaa khil uthaa
 Former Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav held an Iftar party at his government residence in which Chief Minister Nitish Kumar along with all the leaders of the Grand Alliance were also invited
 iftaar party main nitish kumaar to nahin aaye lekin bijepi ke saansad or sine star bihari babu iftaar party main pahunch gaye
 Shatrughan Sinha said in a conversation with Aaj Tak, 'I was invited to attend the Iftar party on behalf of the Lalu family, so went away
 ' halaki aaj hi bijepi kii sahyogi party jediu kii iftaar party bhi thi, lekin shatrughna sinha ne kaha ki nyotaa unhen argedy se hi mila
 Tejapratap - As soon as Shatrughan was engaged in Tejashwi, the entire attention came upon him as soon as he reached the Iftar party
 tejasvi yadav or unke bade bhai tejpratap yadav shatrughna ke aasapaas hi rahe
 During this time, both brothers also saw a competition to sit close to Shatrughan Sinha, although Tej Pratap was seen sitting next to Shatrughan Sinha and Tejaswi had to install a separate chair to sit
 is dauraan lalu yadav kii beti or argedy kii rajyasabha saansad misa bharti bhi najar ain
 Will Shatrughan fight the next election from RJD? Shatrughan Sinha said that his coming here should not be seen in relation to politics
 iskaa raajnneeti se koi sambandh nahin he yah aapasi bhaichaare kaa mauka he or main rishta nibhaane aayaa hum kyonki lalu parivaar se meraa purana sambandh rahaa he
 On this occasion, when the reporters asked Shatrughan Sinha if he would contest from the RJD, Tej Pratap sitting next to him said why not? On this, Shatradhan Sinha also said, 'ghee sugar in Tejapratap's mouth'
 sahi ho sakati he tej pratap kii batshatrughna sinha pichley do turm se patna se bijepi ke saansad hai
 He was elected from Patna Sahib seat last year, but the BJP ignored him and kept growing
 shatrughna lagaataar apni party or sarkaar par nishaanaa bhi sadhate rahe lekin party ne unpar koi karrwai nahin kii
 It is believed that the BJP high command has already decided not to give him a ticket this time, so Shatrughan Sinha is looking for a new home
 kyonki shatrughna kai maukon par lalu parivaar ke saath khadey najar aae hai isliye ho saktaa he ki wo aglaa chunaav argedy se laden
 Lalru Prasad Yadav, who did not attend the party due to ill health, did not attend the Iftar party
 unki beti misa bharti ne bataaya ki unki tabiyat thik nahin he, isliye wo iftaar party main nahin aae
 He said that Lalu has got a bail on the health ground and he is not well
 unki surgery honi he jiske bare main hafte bhar main tay ho jayega, unka sugar level bhi hai tha or jitani jaldi ye level down hoga utani jaldi unki surgery ho jaaegi
 Misa told Aaj Tak that Lalu Yadav has been giving an iftar party ever since he took over as the Chief Minister, but in the last few years, some parties and organizations have started doing it, such as RSS and BJP, all this ever Iftar did not have a party
 lekin isko saamaajik kaary chhodkar political event bana diya
 From our side, it is a symbol of unity which the Rashtriya Janata Dal has been giving and will continue to do
 janata dal (you) ke iftaar main congress ke vidhayakapatna main ek din main argedy or jediu ke iftaar party kaa aayojan hua

 jediu kii iftaar party main shaamil hone ke bare main jab unase poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki mujhe or mere party ke sabhi vidhayak ko aamantran patr mila tha
 i feel like i come
 isse pehle lalu ji kii iftaar party main shaamil hua or abhi haj bhawan main aayaa hum
 i have no desire to change the party, i am a Congress MLA and will remain in Congress

 Then two days later a new group took everyone with them to another hideout
 yahaan bangladeshiyon ko bharatiyon se alag kar diya gaya or phir agle din sabhi bharatiyon ko ek bakhtarband gaadi main daalkar kisi pahari par le jaaya gaya
 The terrorists took everyone's phone and cash here and asked to stand upside down and started firing
 harjit ne apane donon taraf saathiyon ko girte dekha
 The firing lasted for about 2 to 3 minutes
 ek goli harjit ki jaangh chhukar nikal gayi, vah bhi neeche gira
 The Indian standing together fell on him
 aatankiyon ke jane ke kareeb 15 minute baad harjit uthaa or apane saathiyon ko awaz lagaai
 But no one answered
 harjit haive par panhucha or ek gaadi vaale se madad maangi lekin badakismati se vah harjit ko unhi aatankiyon ke paas le gaya
 Harjeet told here that his name is Ali and he is Bangladeshi
 tab jaakar uski jaan bachi
 The terrorists asked for his address and the next day Mosul arrived in his company where he told the whole story to a knowledgeable canteen
 vah shaks harjit ko erbil ke border tak chhod gaya jahaan pahunchakar usne bhartiya ucchayog se sampark saadhaa
 After a week in Iraq, Harjit was brought to India by the government
 lekin pichley 10 maheene se use parivaar se alag rakhaa gaya

 He was promised a job but sometimes after traveling to Noida, sometimes Bangalore and then Dharamshala, Harjeet finally came home

 The Foreign Minister said that according to the information available with the government, all 39 Indians are safe and their search will continue

 aatankiyon ne yahaan sabake phone or cash le liye or ulti taraf munh karke khadey hone ko kaha or firing shuru kar di
 Harjeet saw his comrades falling on both sides
 firing kareeb 2 se 3 minute chali
 a bullet came out touching Harjeet's thigh, he also fell down
 saath main khadaa bhartiya uske upar gir gaya
 About 15 minutes after the terrorists left, Harjeet woke up and called his comrades
 lekin kisi ne jawaab nahin diya
 Harjit reached the highway and asked for help from a carriage but unfortunately he took Harjeet to the same terrorists
 harjit ne yahaan bataaya ki uskaa naam ali he or vah bangladeshi he
 Then he saved his life
 aatankiyon ne uskaa pataa poocha or agle din waapas mosul uski company main panhucha diya jahaan usne ek jaankaar canteen vaale ko puraa vakya bataaya
 He left the person Harjeet to the border of Erbil where he reached and contacted the Indian High Commission

 lekin videsh mantralay ko harjit ki baat par yakeen nahin
 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said that Harjeet was under the patronage of the ministry but is no longer in touch with him
 videsh mantri ne kaha ki sarkaar ke paas maujuud jaankaree ke mutabik sabhi 39 bhartiya surakshit hai or uski talash jari rahegi

 unhone kaha, ‘bhale hi aap film banane vaale vyakti se sahamat na hon, magar use adhikaar he ki vah apni film dikhaae
 If we say that what we said is amazing and the other is not right, then it is double-handedness
 ’to jitne bhi log is film ke liye besabri se intjaar kar rahe the, ve khush ho jaaen
 Because now MSG can be seen in many theaters across the country

 aayran ladi ke naam se mashhoor irom sharmila somvaar ko mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal se dilli sachivalay main mulaakaat karne pahunchi
 The meeting lasted for about an hour, though Irom refused to talk to the media about what was discussed in the meeting
 lekin sutron kii maane to aisi kai or mulaakaaten aane vaale dinon main siem ke saath ho sakati he
 Irom gets Kejriwal's support Prior to this meeting, Irom Sharmila had given information through social media that she would meet Arvind Kejriwal during her stay in Delhi and learn the tricks of politics
 16 saal lanbaa anshankhatm karne ke baad yah pehali baar he, jab irom ne kisi netaa se mulaakaat kii he
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has also spoken of giving political support to Irom after the meeting
 agle saal honge chunaavdarasal manipur main vidhansabha chunaav ke sameekaran banane shuru ho gaye hai or 60 sadasyeey vidhansabha ke liye agle saal chunaav bhi hone hai
 In such a situation, political parties have started to do the ground work
 iromka maananaa he ki dilli main kejariwal ne jis tarah se fatah hasil kii he or nai tarah kii raajnneeti kii shuruyaat kii he, usase vah kaaphi kuch sikh sakati hai
 It is likely that Irom will contest against Manipur Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh from the Tobal seat, for which she may soon announce a new political party
 ibobi singh 2002 se manipur ke mukhyamantri hai
 In Delhi too, Kejriwal showed the Congress 15-year-old government a way out of power, which is probably why Irom Rajneeti thought it better to meet Kejriwal to learn the tricks
 aapako bataa den ki isse pehle irom ne nirdaleey ummidavaar ke taur par chunaav ladane kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 BJP leader and former Deputy Chief Minister of Karnataka KS Eshwarappa made a statement shaming humanity
 ek mahila patrkaar ne unase rajya main mahilaon ke khilaaf badhate aparaadh or vipaksh ke deele ravaiye ko lekar sawaal kiya, to ishwarappa ne khijhakar vivaadaaspad jawaab diya
 Eshwarappa crossed the limits of decorum and said, 'you are here
 yadi koi aapako khinchakar yahaan se le jaae or aapkaa rape kar de to vipaksh isamen kya kar saktaa he?'ishwarappa ne yah baat ek sab-inspector kii antim yatra ke dauraan diya
 He was killed on Friday with a knife

 com / drjimfe6ma — ANI (@ani_news) October 17, 2015 Earlier, the Home Minister of Karnataka also made a controversial statement
 kaha tha ki yadido log rape karen, to vah gangrape nahin hota
 If there was controversy over his statement, if the controversy increased, then Eshwarappa also tried to stop the case from growing by giving clarification
 unhone kaha, 'main karnataka kii sabhi mahilaon ko bahanon kii tarah dekhtaa hum
 We ask the state government what is that tax
 vipakshharasambhav kaam karegaa jisase mahilaon kii suraksha bad sake
 'CM said - do not know the reference, but will take action, to the senior journalists of Karnataka, CM Siddaramaiah said that i do not know in what context Eshwarappa gave this answer
 yadi unhone aisa bayaan diya he to main dekhuunga or ham is maamle main karrwai karenge
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a sixth time in its stronghold Gujarat
 haalanki jeet kii raah main congress ke navnirvaachit adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke badale hue avatar ne khaasaa museebataan khadi kii
 Perhaps this is the reason that BJP has won by a very small margin in its own stronghold
 chunaav ke dauraan gujarat main bijepi ke vikaas par kai sawaal khadey kiye gaye
 If the sources of victory are found, then according to the sources, the face of the Chief Minister in Gujarat may change
 sutron kii maane to gujarat main vijay roopaani ke sthaan par kisi duusare vyakti ko yah pad diya ja saktaa he
 According to the information, the party needs a face that may not be able to match the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Gujarat, but can fulfill the development that the BJP has assured in Gujarat
 janata kii ummiido par khara utre or saath hi bijepi netaaon ko sangathit karne main bhi sakasham ho, jo is chunaav main alag-thalag hote dikhe
 If sources are to be believed, the name of the Union Minister Smriti Irani is in the forefront in this race
 majboot netritv main parangat or gujarati bhashaa kii jaankaar hone ke saath hi smritiiranipradhanmantri ke kareebi mantrion main se ek hai
 In such a situation, sources have raised the possibility that Smriti Irani may become the next Chief Minister of Gujarat
 vahiin, siem pad ke is daud main duusare sthaan par kendriya sadak parivahan or rajmarg or shipping ke rajya mantri mansukh mandavia kaa naam he
 Along with being a Mandaviya Patidar, he includes farmers and land leaders
 jabaki sutara tisare sthaan par vajubhai vaala kaa naam bataa rahe hai
 Vajubhai comes from the Kshatriya society
 vah karnataka ke vartmaan governor hai or gujarat vidhansabha ke purv spikar
 Vajubhai Vala's portfolio includes important sectors like finance, labor and employment
 sanghathan ke jaankaar or saurashtra main acchhee khaasi pakad rakhane vaale vajubhai ke naam par bhi muhar lag sakati he
 It is clear that PM Modi is not happy with the results which have come in the Gujarat elections
 saal 2019 main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav ke liye gujarat behad ahm he
 In such a situation, the Prime Minister does not want to let any kind of lapse on the Gujarat Leadership

 ) Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a road show in Varanasi, then about 5 kilometers, but in this 5 kilometer road show, he will touch the entire mood of Benaras
 unka road sho biechayu get ke paas lanka ilaake main mahaamanaa madan mohan malviya kii pratimaa se shuru hoga biechayu kii vajah se hi banaras ko sarv vidya kii rajdhani bhi kahi jaati he
 It is clear that those professor students will leave here giving a big message
 uske baad raste main mumukshu bhawan padegaa yahaan par sadiyon se log kaashi main mukt kii kaamana lekar yahaan rahete hai
 After this, their convoy will reach Assi Ghat, which is known for the meeting of Benares to Adi, where people will welcome them in large numbers
 uske baad jab vah thodaa sa or aage badhenge to vah sonarpura ke us ilaake main pahunchenge jahaan ek taraf bengali samudaay ke log bahut zyada rahete hai
 So there is also Harishchandra Ghat in this locality on the other side, where King Harishchandra was once tested to be a truthist, today how is this election going on to test the truth and untruth in politics
 iske baad unka kafila muslim bahulya madanpura ke ilaake main pahonchega,jo puri tareeke se bunakar samaaj ke log hai
 In this area of the weavers' society, extensive preparations have been made to welcome Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 madanpura se jab aage chale to goduliya kaa chauraahaa aayaa vah goduliya jo banaras kaa praan kaha jaataa he
 The old mohalla is paved in the area of mahal and after that his convoy moves towards Dashashwamedh Ghat where ever Brahma performed the Ashwamedha Yagya, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will join the world famous Ganga Aarti here in this Mahayagya of politics
 yahaan piem ek bada sandesh denge kyonki banaras dharm kii nagari bhi kahi jaati he or uskaa astitv hi ganga or shiv ke milan kaa he
 It is clear that his procession may not be passing through a very large area of benaras but through those areas of Benaras, from where he will take Nasir to the mood of the whole of Benaras, but will also try to give him a new stream

 Most of his time is spent in a small 6 / 8 foot hut while drunk
 maheenon se is jhonpadi kaa kiraaya bhi nahin diya gaya he
 Industry in Punjab is going through a deep crisis and thousands of Karun stories like Ram Kishan are showing signs of that crisis
 soochna ke adhikaar (artiai) ke tahat maangi gai jaankaree main punjab ke udyog or vaanijya vibhaag ne 31 janvari ko yah bataaya ki pichley saat saal main 18,770 factoriyaan apana shater giraane par majaboor hui hai (dekhen graphic)
 Information received from Jasdeepak Singh, head of the RTI unit at the state Congress office in Chandigarh, shows that the major industrial areas of the once-heavy state and the bustling state like Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Mandi Gobindgarh, Batala and Kapurthala etc
 Scale industrial units have closed
 ambala or ludhiana ke bich grand trunk road (rashtriya rajmarg-1) par sthit mandi gobindgarh punjab ke audyogic kshetron ko lagi bandi kii is mahamari kaa sabase sateek udhaaharan he
 The oldest steel and iron market here dates from the 1930s and is still counted among the largest iron markets in South Asia
 mandi govindgarh main kareeb 450 bhatthiyaan, koyale se chalane vaala dhalikhana (foundry) or rolling milon kii ghani basti he
 These factories made everything from long rods to steel for construction, high carbon steel and all kinds of angles and tunnels
 jiti road par is ilaake se guzarane vaale gaadi vaale vaayu pradooshan se pareshaan rahete the, lekin kaarobaar khub fal-phool rahaa tha
 At the same time, there were also countless stories of the locals becoming abruptly wealthy in this area known only as "mandi"
 lekin ab yah manjar badal gaya he
 Says 24-year-old mill owner Jatin Sood, who is fighting the challenge of keeping his father's two steel rolling factories in some way, "the air here has cleared some, but the mills have been completely ruined
" ’’mandi gobindgarh ke audyogic kshetra kii ek-tihaai ikaiyaan yani kareeb 150 se 170 steel factoriyaan ab tak band ho chuki hai (artiai ke jawaab main di gai jaankaree main rajya sarkaar ne 111 ikaayiyon ke band hone kii baat sweekaar kii he, lekin asal sankhya usase 40 se 60 tak zyada he)
 Many units are not even left alive now
 kuch is ummid main or barbaad hui ja rahi hai ki koi chamatkaar hoga or vah phir se jivit ho uthengi
 The bank took over some factories in hopes of recovering the outstanding debt
 kai bandi ke kagaar par khadi hai
 Three former factory workers Sukhram, Darshan Singh and Karnail Singh have got temporary employment to break up APS International at a distance of few furlongs on the highway on the highway leading to Wazirpur
 25 karod ru
 The rolling mill APS International was established about five years ago, but it closed down about six months ago as the factory losses continued to grow
 factory maalik tathaa ol india steel rirollers association (eiesare) ke maujuuda adhyaksh 46 varshiya rajeev sood kehete hai, ‘‘halaat itane bure hai ki milon kii mashine kharidne vaale log bhi nahin hai
 "they say that no one wants to set up a new factory
" isliye apies international kii ekadam acchhee, nai mashine bhi ghate kii bharpai karne ke liye raddi ke bhav bechni pad rahi hai
 "the last ones go back to GT Road
" vahaan ek or rolling mil bikaner industries ke maalik band ho gai mil kii jagah vyavsaayik parisar banaakar uske jariye badhibia kamai kaa saadhan talashne kii koshish main lage hai
 After selling the last mill machine in the trash, a team of laborers are busy digging the factory land 3 feet deep
 eiesare ke vaais president raaj jindal kehete hai, ‘‘paise kii kami ke kaaran mil maalik aakhri pai tak vasuul lene ke jugad main lage hai
 Due to the continuous accumulation of iron waste in the soil for many years, a large amount of iron has dissolved in the factory land and this is the reason that the soil here is selling at ten times the price than normal soil
 ’’kai mil or bhatti maalikon ne apana dhandha hi badal liya he
 For example, at the site of the oxygen bottling plant on GT Road, a dairy has now opened and two dozen buffalo are tied there
 isi tarah kabhi kaaphi munaafe main rahane vaali jeke mills ab eypiel ambuja ke rihaishi or commercial project ‘‘dream city’’ kaa hissaa he
 Jindal, who is struggling to keep his re-rolling mill Kalyan Industries alive on Amloh Road, says, "the steel industry is now on dialysis
 ’’factoriyon ke band hone ke kaaran ram kishan jaise puraane majdoor to ab ekadam besahaara ho gaye hai
 There is also an exodus of laborers on a large scale
 kareeb 25 saal pehle rojaanaa mazdooree se apni jindagi kaa safar shuru karne vaale uttar pradesh ke sultanpur jile ke 45 saal ke balmukund mishra ab loha factory karmchaaree union ke adhyaksh hai
 He estimates that more than 100,000 workers from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar were working here
 unamem se kareeb 60 se 70 fisadi majdoor kaam kii talash main yaa to himachal pradesh, uttarakhand or gujarat kii ore chale gaye hai yaa phir apane ghar laut gaye hai
 Ramchet Gaur, 47, head of Punjab Purvanchal Sabha, says, "half a day will earn at home
 ’’punjab pradesh congress ke adhyaksh pratap singh bajva ne 3 farvari ko ek press conference main kaha ki ‘‘april, 2007 main shiromani akali dal or bijepi gathbandhan kii sarkaar aane ke baad se rajya main hajaaron audyogic ikaiyaan band ho chuki hai
 "it is obvious that the state government's attitude had increased with this statement
 punjab main bijepi ke puraane netaa or rajya sarkaar main udyog mantri madan mohan mittal kehete hai ki congress kii artiai ke jawaab main di gai jaankaree darasal 2007 ke pehle ke saat saalon main band hui factoriyon ke bare main he, jisamen paanch saal amarinder singh kii aguai vaali congress kii sarkaar thi
 Punjab Industry Secretary Vikas Pratap Singh says that most of the information about closed industries has been taken from the All India Census of the Union Cottage, Small and Medium Industries Ministry in 2007-08
 unki in baton main aanshik sach ho saktaa he, lekin iske saath-saath sach yah bhi he ki rajya prashasan pichley saat saal main band hui audyogic ikaayiyon ke bare main bilkul anjaan he
 This is also evident from the reply of RTI
 masalan sood or jindal ke mutabik pichley teen saal main band hui steel kii anginat audyogic ikaayiyon kaa zikr sarkaar ke jawaab main kahin nahin he
 (workers disassembling machine parts in a steel rolling mill in Mandi, Gobindgarh) This plight of difficult industries can be an excuse for the political turmoil of the ruling Akali dal-bjp and Congress
 is baat ko pehle hi bijepi samarthak jindal kehete hai, ‘‘ham na congress vaale hai, na hi bijepi yaa akali dal vaale
 Our religion is to work for development
 ’’ phir aisa kyon hua? apni udhyamita ke liye vikhyath is rajya main udyogon kii yah khasta haalat kyon he?rajeev sood kehete hai ki centre or punjab sarkaar, donon kii nitiyon ke kaaran aaj yah sankat khadaa hua he
 The problem began in 1995 with the withdrawal of the New Delhi government's rent-equivalent scheme
 yah faisla punjab ke utpaadakon ko mul ilaakon se kaccha maal laane main sahuuliyat dene ke liye liya gaya tha
 The matter became more serious in 2003, when the NDA government excluded Punjab from the list of states giving tax concessions to new industrial units for 10 years
 ye riyaayaten teen pahari rajyon himachal pradesh, uttarakhand or jammu-kashmir ko di gayi
 Says Jindal, "earlier coal and sponge iron could be brought in the same fare
 ye bhilai ke kaarkaanon main uplabdh the
 Today we have to pay Rs 2,800 for every metric ton
 ’’padosi rajyon main tex chhot or paanch saal ke liye badha di gai, jisase sthaneey utpaadakon ke liye unase hode lenaa asambhav ho gaya
 Factory owners say that it would have been an advantage to remain competitive through better quality, but that too, due to higher rates of VAT and electricity
 haryana main bhi bijli kii bhatthi ke liye prati unit 5
 It costs 30 rupees, while 6 in Punjab
 33 rupye
 Government officials blame entrepreneurs for not producing better products
 punjab ke audyogic niti nirmaan se jude rahe udyog vibhaag ke ek adhikari kehete hai, ‘‘utpaada main gunvattta laana hi mukhya masalaa he or gunvattta badhaakar riyaayaton ko bemaani kiya ja saktaa he
 "but they also acknowledge that there is no plan to help small and medium scale industries upgrade the technology in the state
" amritsar rice shellers banane vaale 28 varshiya amandeep bhullar kehete hai, ‘‘yahaan har koi apane liye he
 "tension everywhere although the government is not accepting the crisis, but there is concern
" mandi gobindgarh main bade paimaane par udyogon kii bandi kii khabar ke jawaab main upmukhyamantri sukhbir badal ne 21 janvari ko steel utpaadon par waite 50 fisadi kam karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 Earlier in December 2013, at the Progressive Punjab Industrial Summit, Sukhbir announced several concessions to attract investment in construction sector, production sector, agricultural produce processing and infrastructure
 reliance, bharti airtel, itisi or hinduja samooh ke saath kareeb 65,000 karod ru
 k has signed 124 mous
 lekin udyopatiyon kaa kahana he ki punjab main disambar, 2013 main ‘‘audyogic prashray ke liye vittiya riyaayat’’ se nae niveshkon ko hi laabh milegaa
 "there are very few plans to revive existing industries," says Bhullar
 ’’steel toun main lautie to nasrali road par kareeb 40 karod rupye kii band milon ke maalik suune parisaron main jane kii ijaajat isi shart par dete hai ki unki pahchaan ujagar nahin kii jaaegi, taaki in ikaayiyon main jaan foonkane vaale sambhavit sahyogi kahin ghabara na jaaen
 Some laborers wipe heavy machines every day in the hope that one day they can be revived
 lekin inke bachaav kii koi yojana najar nahin aati he
 So, it is probably a losing battle
 yaheen ram kishan kaam kiya karata tha, jo ab is shant mil kii hi tarah apane andhere bhavishya kii ore takataki lagaae dekhtaa he

 Madhu Koda, former Jharkhand chief minister who is battling allegations of black money, alleged on Saturday that some highly-placed political people had conspired to tarnish his image before the state assembly elections and the allegations against him were proved correct
 If done, he will retire from politics
 main unhen benakaab kar duungakoda ne kaha ‘‘mujhe pataa he ki unche padon par baithe kuch raajnneetik log mere khilaaf kaam kar rahe hai
 i will expose them when the time comes
 ’’ hawala or avaidh rup se nivesh karke 2000 karod rupye se zyada kii sampatti batorne ke aarope main iskar vibhaag tathaa pravartan nideshaalay kii jaanch kaa saamana kar rahe kodaa ne kaha ki unhone raajnneeti main ek mukaam hasil karne ke liye kadaa sangharsh kiya he lekin virdohi unki chhavi ko dhoomil karne ke liye bhaddi tarkiben apana rahe hai
 Conspiracy to keep me away from the public In the wake of the assembly elections in Jharkhand, Koda, who has applied to the Enforcement Directorate for a change in the program of inquiry, said that before the election, there was a conspiracy to keep him away from the public
 kodaa ne arji main kaha he ki chunaav main hissaa lenaa unka adhikaar he
 He has requested that he be questioned only after the election in connection with the allegations
 dost chun sakate hai, padosi nahin
 These lines have often been called Pakistan-loving politicians, especially when he is about to visit Pakistan
 china bhi hamaara padosi he, par china ke maamle main ham hindi-chini bhai-bhai kaa naaraa duhraate hai
 sounds delicious
 hindi hai ham, chini se bahut pyaar he
 Brother is from Pakistan, he is a neighbor
 padosi hai china ke vah bhai he
 We offer arms before the arrival of Chinese leaders, here and there we get the news that China's grandeur will not work
 bharat do took baat karegaa
 When he arrives, a strange fake sweetness dissolves in the atmosphere
 sugar-free mithaas
 An ill feeling
 lee kachiyang aae, hamane unke naam kaa uccharan karne kii practice kii
 Prime Ministers of both countries met
 unke ghaney kaale range bal, hamaari safed dadhi aapas main baaten karte rahe
 Heart could not be found; khub mili
 Got shaken up
 donon deshon ke bich sambandhon kii nai aadharshila rakhi gai
 What we said was the influx of one ear, raft with the other
 hamaare kaan main basth ke us tamaache kii gunj jaati nahin
 a Ching or Ming from Beijing tells us an important power, we are so convinced to accept anything
 ladakh ke daulat oldy beg main 19 kimi ghus aae, hamane bahut maan-manuval kiya tab unki sena waapas gai
 On the condition that our army also retreat from its land
 hamane mana
 Once again, we swore that we would force them to respect the agreement on the boundary dispute
 hamane koshish kii, unhone hamen hi samjhaute kaa sammaan karne kii ghudki pilaai
 Will keep talking about border disputes
 koi samay seemaa nahin
 No promise brahmaputra nadi ke maamle par hamane awaz uthaai
 They said they would keep talking
 china kii daityakaar pariyojnaayen chalati rahengin
 Along with the talk
 hamaara sabase bada vyapaar china ke saath he
 But it is almost one-sided
 ham china se aayaat bahut karte hai
 Exports too low
 is vyapaar ghate ko kam karne kii zimmedaari china kii bhi he kyonki ham itane bade bazaar hai
 Our health is good for China's health
 vyapaar par aakar baat rukii he
 Eight new agreements have been reached
 sarkari samajhadaari isi main he ki ham samjhaute karte rahen
 Agreement
 panchasheel kaa samjhauta, nangal dam ke paas maanav-nirmit jhil ke kinare
 The punch of 62 caused disillusionment but not disenchantment
 ham vikasshil tehre, export main pichde tehre, jansankhya tak main kam hai ham
 We are more just in democracy
 unka tantra apana he
 There is party system
 kisi bhi keemat par aage rahane kaa mantra he
 We have an ax, feet too
 or apano se bair bhi
 Manmohan Singh came to Kachiang, China, to go there
 antni ja rahe hai, salmaan ho aae hai
 The issues which were yesterday are the same today
 un masalon kaa hal hoga samjhauta
 Which we will do
 kyonki hamane maan liya he ki ham chote hai
 There are trails in every field
 hamaara palada baari ho par ham loktantr ko taraazoo par rakhte nahin
 We do not know the weight of democracy

 15 november, 1989 ko pakistan ke khilaaf sachin ne apana test kariyar shuru kiya
 Sachin was able to score just 15 runs in this Test match played in Karachi
 9 agast, 1990 ko unhone england ke khilaaf apane test kariyar kaa pehla shatak jadaa
 Sachin went ahead as a batsman and scored a century
 test cricket main sabase zyada ran banane ke gavaskar (10122) ke record ko sachin tendulkar ne todaa
 On 10 December 2005, Sachin Tendulkar broke Gavaskar's record of the most 34 centuries in Tests
 is tarah 17 saalon ke baad gavaskar kii bhavishyavaanee sach sabit hui
 The interesting thing here is that Sachin scored his first century in first-class matches on December 10 and on December 10, he broke Gavaskar's record of making the most centuries in Tests
 gavaskar kii bhavishyavaanee phir 10 disambar ko hi sach hui : sachin acha khelte rahe or bhartiya team main unka chayan hua
 On 15 November 1989, Sachin started his Test career against Pakistan
 karachi main khele gaye is test match main sachin sirf 15 ran bana paae the
 On 9 August 1990, he scored the first century of his Test career against England

 10 disambar, 2005 ko sachin tendulkar ne test maichon main gavaskar ke sarvaadhik 34 shatak ke record ko todaa
 Thus, after 17 years, Gavaskar's prediction came true
 yahaan dilachasp baat yah he ki sachin ne 10 disambar ko hi pratham shrenee maichon main apana pehla shatak jamaaya tha or 10 disambar ko hi unhone test maichon main sarvaadhik shatak banane kaa gavaskar kaa record todaa

 5 gaanv ke 64 bighas kii jameen par lage bannron par likhaa hua he ki is jameen kii malkin sanju devi meena hai
 Who cannot be the mistress of this land, so the Income Tax Department is immediately taking possession of this land

 There is no source of income after the death of Sanju Devi's husband and she herself works as a laborer to raise two children

 The revelation of income tax has created a stir in the area as villagers say that many companies have bought land here, which is said to be land owned by the company but no one knows

 aaj tak reating – 9 / 10 After the victory in Delhi, now BJP councilors have got a new target
 ye target he, dilli ko saaf karne kaa
 Union Minister Vijay Goel has said that Kimodi Mantra means the mantra of development and the mantra of cleanliness
 goyal ke mutabik jabaki parshadon ne aupchaarik taur par apana kaamkaaj nahin sambhala he
 He has not been sworn in as a councilor, then the party president has made him realize his duty, because the councilors have to be sensitive to the problems of the city
 unke kandhon par kitni badi zimmedaari he, iskaa ehsaas dilaanaa he
 According to Goyal, Amit Shah has put the vision of PM Modi in front of the councilors and advised them that the development should not be of the councilors but of the people
 janata ko bijepi se bahut ummiden he, or un ummiido par khara utarana hi parshadon kii asli kasuti he
 The new councilors also appeared cautious after Shah's class and did not forget to mention the Modi mantra in the statements
 malviya nagar se parshad chuni gayi nandani sharma ne kaha kii piem banane ke baad modi ji ne desh main igvarnence or digital india kii raah dikhaayi he
 That is why we will use digital technology for the facilities of citizens in MCD too
 hauj khaas se parshad anil sharma ne kaha kii modi ji kaa sapanasvachh bharatka he or ye sabase pehali zimmedaari emsidi kii he
 The dream of Swachh Bharat will come true, the first thing to be done is to make Delhi not only clean but also beautiful
 parshadon ko ye bhi mantra diya gaya kii emsidi kii jeet sirf padaav he, manzil nahin
 That is why, be prepared for the real exam of the coming assembly elections and work as the target, tell the people that the development and well-being of Delhi can be done by them
 arvind kejariwal bhrashtachar ke khilaaf aam aadmi kii awaz uthaate-uthaate raajnneetik party banane chale gaye or unhone isi naam kii ek party bhi bana lee
 He felt that he could come to power by cashing in on public anger
 yah ek swaabhaavik chintan he or isamen kuch bhi galat nahin he
 Politics and that too Indian politics is like a mud pond in which one descends
 lekin shaayad kejariwal yah soch rahe the ki unke liye chijen kuch alag tarah kii hongi
 Those attacking others often forget about themselves
 aisa hi kuch kejariwal ke maamle main hua
 Now, one after the other charges are being leveled at Kejriwal
 sabase bada aarope to yah laga ki unhone dange bhadakaane ke aaropee ek dharmik netaa kaa saath liya or ab doosraa bada aarope he ki unke liye videshon se jo dhan aa rahaa he use dene vaale log sahi nahin he or kitna dhan mila he yah raashi chhupaai ja rahi he
 Kejriwal is angry with these allegations and is resisting them in his aggressive style which he should also do
 lekin ab unhen yah pataa chal rahaa hoga ki dusron par aarope madh dena bada aasaan he lekin jab baat apane par aati he to bahut chot lagati he
 Kejriwal must have been stinging these things too, because he considers himself a wash of milk and there is no harm in it
 unka record bahut saaf-suthra rahaa he lekin yah raajnneeti to kisi ko nahin chhodti he
 It has its colors, its own style and its own game
 sirf doodh kaa dhulaa hone se raajnneeti main kuch nahin hota
 If this were to happen, why would Shiv Kheda and Manmohan Singh lose the election? These people have a clean image, the number of their fans is very large
 darasal, jab aap duusare par waar karte hai to khud bhi chot khaane ke liye taiyaar rahiye, kyonki yah duusare par ungali uthaane jaisaa he, jisamen chaar ungliyaan aapaki taraf bhi uthati he or kejariwal yah baat bhul gaye
 Politics is a labyrinth of lies in which it is very difficult to find the truth
 ab kejariwal ko yah sach bataanaa hi hoga or apane upar lage tamaam aaropon ko sabooton ke saath khaarij karnaa hoga
 They face very big players of this game who will not let them sit easily
 lekin yah unke liye ek mauka bhi he ki ve apane ko or majbootee se sthapit kar len
 This will increase their confidence in the public and strengthen their steps
 raajnneeti kii phislan bhari raah main chalane kii aadat to unhen daalani hi hogi

 He was trampled to death by tractor
 isi tarah bhind main ipies adhikari jayadevan ne sharaab mafia kii nakel kasi to un par hamalaa kar diya gaya

 Whether Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan or Home Minister Umashankar Gupta have been constantly assuring that there is no bigger than law
