 That is, the education that should be done is not happening, but through TV channels, politics is teaching you the syllabus of hindu-muslim
 acchhee baat yah he ki har din zamin par lakhon kii sankhya main log apni samasyaon ko lekar channelon ke darvaaze khatkhata rahe hai ki unki khabar chale or chalane ke baad sarkaar karrwai kare
 People have worked their way out

 Our business, life, everything is destroyed
 neshnal media yah sawaal kyon nahin uthaata he
 Some youths of Bareilly have written that this village is situated on the main highway Pilibhit bypass
 hamaare kasbe kii main road jisaki tasviir ham atech kar rahe hai, aap dekh lijie
 In June 2018, MLA passed the road and got the foundation stone laid, but see the photo

 The Kawandis of Pilibhit, Nawabganj, Khatima and Tanakpur pass through this route

 The media has left the people or by printing their struggle or news in a corner, it takes the edge off by speed

 The road connecting Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Maharashtra with Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Eastern regions up to the capital Delhi is in a very bad condition, wasting a lot of time due to hours of jam
 yahi nahin sthaneey logon kaa janajivan bhi puri tarah prabhavit he
 Now BJP MP Ranveer Singh Judeo has started creating a ruckus about it
 ranvir singh judev ne mukhyamantri se apil kii he ki ve khud aakar is sadak kii haalat dekh jaaen
 It is not that the public is not active on its behalf

 Local newspapers are publishing the same news that a pregnant woman died due to falling into a pit
 yah haive is baat kaa bhi pramaan he ki sthaneey str par rose chhapane ke baad bhi vyavastha harakat main nahin aati he
 The MP has also written a letter

 We are showing you the news of Bhagalpur edition of Prabhat Khabar

 tippaniyan Now see that 8 lakh railway students are worried that their center is lying 2000 km away
 ye chaatr badi sankhya main hai or rail mantri piyush goyal ko lagaataar twit kar rahe hai
 Ashok Chaudhary of Rajasthan has tweeted to the Railway Minister that he has to travel from Nagaur to Patiala for the exam
 kolkata ke mithilesh yadav ne likhaa he ki unka centre bhopal kyon diya gaya he
 a large number of students are contacting us
 1 agast ko bihar ke do teen jagahon par kuch chaatro ne pradarshan bhi kiya
 The flags of Sasand Pappu Yadav's party are also seen in it
 centre dur hone ke kaaran bahut se chaatr tikat kharid nahin paa rahe hai
 Many students are not getting tickets because the train does not have space
 ek samasya yah bhi he ki 3 din lagaakar pariksha dene ja rahe hai magar uske aas paas kuch or parikshaayen bhi pad rahi hai jo unka chhot jayega
 Rahul Jaiswal from Bihar has tweeted to the Railway Minister that on August 10, Hyderabad has a test in the railway and the next day if they have a test of Grameen Bank, how will they be able to give
 duuri ke kaaran hawaii jahaaz se waapas aane kii unki aarthik kshamta nahin he
 The youth of the country are worried about the job
 railway kii bhartee pariksha main badi sankhya main chaatro ke form riject hue hai
 This was the last chance for many
 main pehle bhi zikr kiya tha magar ve rose guzarish karte hai ki ek baar or zikr kar dijie taaki rail mantri kii nazar pad jaae
 Now do not think there will be anything in it
 9 agast se pariksha hone ja rahi he
 Students have different things about the rejected form
 kuch baton ko sunakar lagata he ki unki shikaayat suni jaani thi par kya karen
 So for their peace we have mentioned today
 ab is baat kii jaanch khud bhi kar len ki rail mantralay sunata he yaa nahin
 8 lakh students should also check what is the effect of raising the issue due to the center falling three days away in prime time
 logon ne apana tarika nikaal liya he
 For the last two days, people from Hafizganj town of Bareilly in UP have been messing up that the road in our area is very bad
 hamaara kaarobaar, jivan sab kuch tabah ho gaya he
 Why does the national media not raise this question
 bareli ke kuch naujavaanon ne likhaa he ki yah gaanv main haive pilibhit bypass par sthit he
 You can see the picture of the main road in our town, which we are attaching
 june 2018 main vidhayak ji ne road paas karvaa kar shilanyas bhi karvaa diya magar photo dekh lijie
 This is also the way for Kanwadi to come
 pilibhit, nawabganj, khatima or tanakpur ke kaanvadiye isi maarg se guzarate hai
 Sir, Shiva devotees pass through dirty water and mud
 dekhakar bura lagata he, par ham janata kya kar sakate hai
 School children come in clean and clean clothes everyday, but the poor people go through dirty water every day, fall and get hurt
 prashasan kaan main tel daal kar baitha he
 Once you show it in prime time, your effect is very quick
 pichley teen saal se road kii haalat karaab he
 Please send a reporter here and show it on TV via NDTV
 vicitra shankhadhaar ne hamaare liye ye video banaakar bheja he
 Vichitra had also complained to the District Magistrate last year with photographs that the road should be fixed
 barish har saal kaa bahaanaa he, tuuti sadakon ko toote rahane kaa ek tarah se seva vistaar he barish
 But people know that there are many roads in the rain which are not broken
 media ne logon ko chhod diya he yaa unke sangharsh yaa khabaron ko kisi kone main chhap kar, speed main hadabad-hadabad chalaakar kinaaraa kar letaa he
 Will you ever watch Speed news? khabaren is tarah se guzar jaati hai jaise express train ke bagal se superfast train
 The news is present but the speed of the speed news kills those news
 log samaj rahe hai ki khabaron kaa matlab kya hota he
 We showed the condition of National Highway NH-43 a few days ago
 uski haalat jas kii tas he
 The Katni Gumla National Highway passes through Ambikapur Batauli and Sitapur in Surguja district
 2016 main andhrapradesh kii ek company ko tender mila tha magar yahaan abhi tak kaam puraa nahin hua he
 The company uprooted the old half of the road but did not build anything new
 company kaa pataa nahin he
 The latest news is that the condition of the road worsened due to the rain, causing a long 24-hour jam
 andhra pradesh, urisa, maharashtra ko madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh, uttar pradesh or purvi pradeshon ke saath rajdhani dilli tak jodne vaali is sadak kii haalat bahut kharaab he, ghanton jam ke kaaran kaaphi samay barbaad ho rahaa he
 Not only this, the life of the local people is also completely affected
 ab bijepi saansad ranvir singh judev ne ise lekar hangaamaa machaana shuru kar diya he
 Ranveer Singh Judeo has appealed to the Chief Minister to come and see the condition of this road himself
 aisi baat nahin he ki janata apni taraf se sakriy nahin he
 In Bhagalpur itself, engineering students from rickshaws to engineering have performed different dharna to repair National Highway 107
 hamane jab 11 july ko khabar dikhaai thi tab uske agle din gadde bharne kaa kaam shuru bhi hua tha magar phir uske baad sab kuch vahiin kaa vahiin ruka hua he
 People's problems are increasing
 barish ke kaaran sadaken kharaab nahin hui hai, barish ke pehle se hi karaab hai
 The people of Bhagalpur are demanding democratically and everyone is aware of this problem, just the solution is not being done
 pichley hafte 28 july ko bhagalpur ejineering college ke chaatro ne bhi is sadak ko lekar pradarshan kiya
 His college is on NH-80
 college ke baahar bade-bade gadde bane hone ke kaaran chaatr hi gir jate hai
 They get hurt
 chaatro ne apane naagarik hone kaa farz adaa kiya or ek din binar poster lekar is sadak ke nirmaan kii maang kii
 It is not that the people are not active on their behalf
 hamane 11 july ko is haive ko lekar prime time main dikhaaya tha
 The next day its pits started to be filled, but our colleague Kanhaiya says that work was done on the same day, after that there is no trace of work
 sthaneey akhabaaron main yahi khabaren chap rahi hai ki gadde main girane ke kaaran garbhvatee mahila kii maut ho gai
 This highway is also proof that the system does not come into action even after daily appearances at the local level
 saansad ne bhi patr likhaa he
 Everybody has done everything but there is no improvement in NH-80
 ham aapako prabhaat khabar ke bhagalpur sanskaran kii khabar dikhaa rahe hai
 On July 31, it was reported that the life of pregnant woman Vibha Kumari was lost due to this road
 rishtedaaron ne bataaya ki vibha ko lagaataar khun nikal rahaa tha, aspataal lekar ja rahe the lekin krishi vishvavidhyalay ke paas jam main unka auto funs gaya
 Vibha lost her life due to excessive blood flow
 prabhaat khabar ke anusaar is sadak par gaddhon ke kaaran jam laga hua tha
 Often remains
 vibha ko sabor se mayaganj pahunchane main 2 ghante lag gaye
 When auto fell in every pit, Vibha screamed with pain
 aapane ejineering college ke chaatro ko suna
 They are quite clear about their rights
 chaatro ne apane pradarshan se neshnal haive ke eczecutive ejeeniyar ko majaboor kar diya ki ve sade kaagaj par likhakar vaada karen ki ek hafte main gadde bhar denge or 21 sitambar tak puraa kaam ho jayega
 The students said that the stuffing of the pit is coming
 hamane unase kaha ki unke pradarshan ke 5 din baad college ke saamne kya sthiti he kya ve video record kar bhej sakate hai
 See what you have sent
 godi media janata ke muddon ko upar aane se roak rahaa he, upar ke muddon ko janata ke maathe par thope rahaa he magar janata sangharsh kar rahi he, wo tasviren le rahi hai, video bhi bana rahi he or jahaan tahaan media waalon ko bhej rahi he
 Politics has moved away from these issues
 wo kisi theme ko lekar agenda set karti he, jise lekar aap bahes karte rahe
 The comments ab dekhie 8 lakh railway ke chaatr pareshaan hai ki unka centre 2000 kimi dur centre padaa he
 These students are in large numbers and are constantly tweeting Railway Minister Piyush Goyal
 rajasthan ke ashok choudhary ne rail mantri ko twit kiya he ki unhen pariksha ke liye nagaur se patiala janaa pad rahaa he
 Mithilesh Yadav of Kolkata has written why his center has been given Bhopal
 badi sankhya main chaatr hamase sampark kar rahe hai
 On August 1, some students demonstrated in two places of Bihar
 isamen saasand pappu yadav kii party ke jhande bhi dikh rahe hai
 Many students are unable to purchase tickets as the center is away
 bahut se chaatro ko tikat nahin mil rahaa he kyonki train main jagah nahin he
 There is also a problem that he is going to take the exam after 3 days, but there are some other examinations around him which will be missed
 bihar se rahul jaiswal ne rail mantri ko twit kiya he ki 10 agast ko hyderabad main railway kaa imtehaan he or agle din gramin bank kii pariksha he to ve kaise de paaenge
 They do not have the economic ability to return by plane due to distance
 desh kaa yuva naukari ko lekar pareshaan hai
 a large number of students' forms have been rejected in the Railway Recruitment Examination
 bahuton ke liye yah aakhri chance tha
 i had mentioned earlier also, but every day they request that we mention once more so that the railway minister can be seen
 ab lagata nahin ki isamen kuch hoga
 The exam is going to be held from 9 August
 riject hue form ke bare main chaatro kii alag-alag baaten hai
 Hearing some things, it seems that their complaint was to be heard but what to do
 to unki shanti ke liye hamane aaj bhi zikr kar diya
 Now, check for yourself whether the Railway Ministry listens or not
 8 lakh chaatr bhi jaanch kar len ki prime time main teen-teen din dur centre padane ke kaaran pareshaani kaa mudda uthaane kaa kya asar hota he
 Rain is an excuse every year, one way service extension of broken roads is rain
 magar log jaanate hai ki barish main aisi bahut si sadake hai jo nahin tuuti hai
 The media has left the people or by printing their struggle or news in a corner, it takes the edge off by speed

 BJP President Amit Shah has attacked CM Nitish Kumar in an election rally
 amit shah ne aarope lagaaya ki nitish ne bihar kii janata se dhokhaa kiya or BJP kii peeth par khanjar chalaaya
 He also accused lalu-nitish of lying on the issue of reservation
 bijepi jansangh ke vakt se hi aarakshan samarthalamit shah ne aarope lagaaya ki lalu-nitish aarakshan ke mudde par jaan-boojhkar jhooth bolkar janata ke bich bhram failaa rahe hai
 He claimed that BJP has been supporting reservation since the time of Jana Sangh, there is no scope for change
 unhone kaha ki lalu raajnneeti to karte hai samaajwaad or pichhadon kii, lekin tikat beton ko baantate hai
 Family is the first for Lalu
 'jangalraj laane vaale se mil gaye nitish'begusarai main chunaav prachaar karte hughamit shahne kaha ki jis jangalraj kaa virodh karke nitish ne satta pai, usee jangalraj ko laane vaale lalu prasad se ve mil gaye
 He claimed that the lalu-nitish pair would not be able to take Bihar forward
 unhone kaha ki jangalraj ke dauraan apharan, dakaiti or khun kii ghatnaayen lagaataar saamne aati thim
 The BJP president said that Jayaprakash Narayan had given the slogan of 'complete revolution' against the Congress, but now jp's followers Lalu and Nitish have formed an alliance with the Congress
 unhone kaha ki nitish satta hasil karne ke liye kisi se bhi dagaa kar sakate hai
 Encouraging BJP workers, Amit Shah said that this party has been winning through the hard work of the workers
 gauratlab he ki shahchunaav prachaar ke liye 7 dinon ke bihar daure parahain
 Aajtak's 'operation Ram Mandir' on the Ram temple has exposed the Hindu and Muslim parties of the Ram Janmabhoomi case
 yah khulaasa nyaay ke sabase bade mandir yani supreme court ke prati aasthaa rakhane vaale desh ke har deshbhakt naagarik ko jhakzor kar rakh degaa
 In order to carry out 'operation Ram Mandir', Aaj Tak's Undercover Reporters along with intelligence cameras met the parties in Ayodhya who trust the Supreme Court regarding the Ram Janmabhoomi case in front of the cameras
 lekin camere ke band hote hi unki raay bhi badal jaati he
 An old issue of communal tension about which the dam of patience is now weakening
 ek taraf ayodhya main ramamandir nirmaan ko lekar besabri kaa alam he or duusari taraf supreme court he, jahaan se ram janmabhumi vivaad cese main taarikh par taarikh mil rahi he
 But do the Hindu and Muslim petitioners speak on the issue of Ram temple, do they really think the same? Knowing the explosive thinking of the Muslim parties of Ram Janmabhoomi in this Aaj Tak's intelligence cameras, knowing your explosive thinking will make your hair stand up
 ram janmabhumi vivaad cese main muslim pakshakaar haji mehboob ko aapane akasar camaron ke saamne supreme court ke faisle kaa sammaan karte or ramamandir kaa paksh lete hue suna hoga
 Once, he had even agreed to compromise outside the court for Ram temple
 unhone kaha tha ki agar babari masjid kii jagah chhodte hai, to agar hindu apana mandir banaaen hamen koi aitraaj nahin he
 But when Aaj Tak's undercover reporter interacted with Haji Mehboob at home in Ayodhya, his two-pronged thinking came to light
 haji mehboob- aaj bhi agar masjid masale main agar jajment aa jaae to kya aap jaanate hai miyaan, kya aap vahaan ek eent rakh sakate hai
 i had also done the challenge, we said till i am alive, keep a brick and tell me
 reporter - jajment ke baad bhi ? supreme court ke jajment ke baad bhi
 
 haji mehboob - haa, haa, rakh ke bataaen
 
 inshollah main jinda hum jab tak, saaf baat main kahata hum
 
 main to bolta hum
 
 meri jindagi main wo ek eent nahin rakh sakate
 
 chaahe wo kuch bhi kar len
 
 reporter - ram mandir kii ?haji mehboob - haa yaad rakhiyegaa
 
 reporter - chaahe supreme court kaa jajment hi kyon na ho ?haji mehboob - chaahe supreme court kaa jajment ho
 
 chaahe jahannum main jajment ho
 
 main musalmaan hum or chota sa musalmaan hum, gunahagaar hum lekin wo meri jindagi main eent nahin rakh sakate
 
 reporter - supreme court kaa jajment bhi nahin maanenge aap ?haji mehboob - kuch bhi nahin maanoonga
 
 yaad rakhiyegaa
 
 oparation ram mandir dekhne ke liye yahaan clic karen
 
 
 That is, Haji Mehboob does not get tired of trusting the Supreme Court in front of open cameras, the same Haji Mehboob can be heard defying the Supreme Court's decision on the intelligence camera
 jab hamane haji mehboob se poocha ki agar wo supreme court ke faisle ke baad bhi ramamandir nahin banane denge to desh ke halaat bighad sakate hai
 So this was Haji Mehboob's answer
 
 
 reporter - jaise aap kah rahe hai ki supreme court kaa jajment bhi hinduon ke fevar main aayaa, mandir ko lekar to aap ek eent nahin lagane denge
 
 haji mehboob - bilkul nahin lagane duungaa
 
 main aapse
 
 aap musalmaan hai isliye main kah rahaa hum, nahin to, maine to kaha ki bhai thik he jajment aayega, dekha jayega
 i said this 
 But suppose y Keen
 
 No Muslim can tolerate that
 
 Reporter - So there will be a clash, it will be in the country? Haji Mehboob - It would have been a clash
 
 Will happen
 
 Have to be, what are two opinions in this? 
 Haji Mehboob exposed his double-minded thinking not only to the Ram temple, but also to the largest temple of justice on Aaj Tak's intelligence camera
 lekin sawaal ye he ki haji mehboob itnaa bada daawa, itane confidence se kaise kar rahe hai
 Haji Mahboob himself gave us the answer
 haji mehboob ne ajtak ke khufia camere par kabool kiya kii 1992 main ayodhya main bigade maahaul main unhone khud bam chalavaaye the or koi unka kuch bigaad nahin paaya tha
 Haji Mehboob - i do not lie
 jo hota he wo duniya jaanati he ki haji mehboob ne bam chalavaaye the
 i had it run
 do raay nahin he
 Reporter - you planted the bomb? Haji Mehboob - you got it done
 
 Haji Mehboob - This is administration too, God is sorry
 wo mujhase bahut darati he
 
 reporter - yahaan ayodhya kii ?haji mehboob - ayodhya kya, faizabad jo bhi he
 
 haji mehboob ne ramamandir or ram janmabhumi cese ko lekar apane dil main chhipe iraade ajtak ke khufia camere par kholkar rakh die
 So now the question was that the intentions regarding the Ram temple in Ayodhya are Haji Mehboob
 vahiin ram janmabhumi cese ke baaki muslim pakshakaar bhi rakhte hai
 The decision against Babri Masjid is not acceptable - in the case of Iqbal Ansariram Janmabhoomi dispute, Babri Masjid's party Iqbal Ansari has also said in front of cameras, like Haji Mehboob, that if the Modi government brings an ordinance on the construction of Ram temple, then they will have any objection Will not done
 20 november ko unhone kaha tha ki agar kanoon banane se desh kaa bhala ho rahaa he
 If there is peace, make laws, from where the law is to be made, from there the law will be made
 camere par ikbaal ansaari kii baaten sunakar lagata he ki unke man main kanoon ko lekar bahut aasthaa he
 But behind the cameras, Iqbal Ansari also turns to Haji Mehboob
 ajtak ke khufia camere par ikbaal ansaari ko ye kehete hue suna ja saktaa he ki agar supreme court kaa faisla babari masjid ke khilaaf aata he to use nahin maanenge or naa koi or musalmaan maanane ko taiyaar hoga
 Reporter - You think people will accept the decision of the Supreme Court
 
 Iqbal Ansari - Ayodhya, this is Babri Masjid
 isko puri duniya jaanati he
 So the Supreme Court should decide
 
 Like people come to know the name of the minister after 5 years
 
 Similarly, many generations to come to Babri Masjid will know that this mosque is in Ayodhya
 ye naam isiilie padaa he babari masjid
 Reporter - i am saying the same, so no one will accept this decision of the Supreme Court
 
 Iqbal Ansari - No one will listen
 
 Reporter - i will not agree? Iqbal Ansari - No one will agree
 
 When we asked the off camera Babri Masjid party Iqbal Ansari what would happen if the decision did not come in favor of the Muslims
 is par ikbaal ansaari kii raay bhi haji mehboob kii raay se match kar gai
 Reporters - if the Supreme Court's decision comes against the Muslims, i will not accept Muslims? Iqbal Ansari - will not
 reporter - musalmaan nahin maanenge to karenge kya?ikbaal ansaari - aap musalmaan ho
 
 aap kya karoge bataao
 
 reporter- gussiqabaal ansaari - to phir aise hi jaan loreporter - phir to bavaal hoga desh main ?iqbaal ansaari - bavaal banaaya gaya he
 
 yani naa to ikbaal ansaari or naa hi haji mehboob, ayodhya main vivaadit bhoomi par ramamandir nirmaan hone dene ke paksh main nahin hai
 Then why should the Supreme Court not order the construction of Ram temple
 yani ram janmabhumi vivaad main in donon muslim pakshakaron kii soch domunhi he
 One that speaks on camera and one that Aaj Tak told you
 ab sawaal ye he ki jab muslim pakshakaron ko supreme court kaa faisla maananaa hi nahin he to phir wo cese lard hi kyon rahe hai
 
 
 The answer to this question is found in Haji Mehboob's claim which he has made on Aaj Tak's intelligence camera
 haji mehboob ne saaf kaha ki ol india muslim personal lau board babari masjid ke naam par acha-khaasaa paisa kama rahaa he
 
 
 Reporter - Now while he also claims Ayodhya on Babri Masjid
 
 Haji Mahboob - Director - Personal Law Board
 
 Haji Mehboob - Hey, all these claims are coming for the same, they are doing politics on the same
 
 Whatever is coming is coming in the name of Ayodhya
 
 Reporter - good money is coming to them? Haji Mehboob - has come a lot
 
 And where are we getting it from? 
 Someone fights in his pocket, who is fighting for the mosque
 
 Haji Mehbooba claims that the All India Personal Law Board does politics in the name of Babri Masjid and in the name of Babri Masjid, money comes not only from all over the country but also from abroad
 
 
 reporter - ol india muslim personal lau board ke paas funding kahaan se aa rahi he?haji mehboob - wo jane?reporter - jaisaa aap kah rahe hai na ayodhya babari masjid ke naam par kaaphi paisa aayaa unke paas ?haji mehboob - are, har jagah se aa rahaa he libya he
 
 kai baar to hamaare saamne
 
 haji mehboob kii baaten babari masjid ke naam par chal rahe siyasat ke khel ko kholkar rakh detii hai
 Haji Mehboob claims that those who fill their pockets by doing politics at Babri Masjid, never want this issue to be resolved
 haji mehboob - dekhie hamaari kaum main, wo bhi nahin chaahate is masale ko khatm karnaa
 
 reporter - hamaari kaum ke log bhi nahin chaahate, musalmaan bhi nahin chaahate ?haji mehboob - koi nahin chahta
 
 reporter - ayodhya kaa masalaa hal ho
 
 ? vajah isaki sar ?haji mehboob - vajah he ki agar jab tak chalata rahegaa, sabaki rotiyaan, daal roti chalati rahengi
 
 
 Babri Masjid's party Iqbal Ansari also agrees with Haji Mehboob's talk
 ikbaal ansaari ne mana ki babari masjid ke naam par bahut si sansthaaen or log sirf raajnneeti kar rahe hai or paisa kama rahe hai
 
 
 Iqbal Ansari - Who Does? 
 We still say who helps
 
 Come and go
 
 The name is of Babri Masjid
 
 All people come throughout the day
 
 If you guys are in our place
 
 You know how many people help us
 
 Many people earn on our work
 
 Who gives what 
 Those who are there will tell the work of the country, when they go to Ayodhya, they look after the Muslims
 
 There is donations here, there is donations there
 
 Who gives money here? 
 Reporter - means people are earning in your name? Iqbal Ansari - All people earn
 
 The same remained on the time of our father
 
 People make empty idiots
 
 Let's do politics
 
 On Aaj Tak's intelligence camera, Iqbal Ansari revealed that he was also offered an offer to drop the Babri Masjid case by a Muslim religious leader who had mediated outside the court over the Ram Janmabhoomi
 
 Iqbal Ansari - Say, take half the land in Lucknow, brother
 
 Reporter - What did you say? Iqbal Ansari - Take half the ground in Lucknow
 
 Wasim Rizvi is giving
 
 Reporter - What is half a bed? Iqbal Ansari - means 600 sq ft
 reporter - 600 sq ft
 Take the land in Lucknow
 
 Iqbal Ansari - Yes, in Lucknow
 
 Reporter - For what? Iqbal Ansari - For the mosque
 
 The truth that Iqbal Ansari is claiming, he himself would have known, but Iqbal Ansari also claimed on Aaj Tak's intelligence camera that if a socialist government is formed in UP, his sons are sure to be hired
 ikbaal ansaari - abaki akhilesh sarkaar aegi, usee main ho jayega
 
 ham to yahi ummid lagaae hai
 
 reporter - kisi se baat chal rahi he ?ikbaal ansaari - ab kii ho jayega
 
 baatcheet to he
 
 reporter - agali upi sarkaar main ho jaaegi naukari?ikbaal ansaari - hareporter - baatcheet he aapaki ?ikbaal ansaari - haanikabal ansaari kii baaten sunakar lagata he ki wo babari masjid ke pakshakaar rahete-rahete apni aane vaali pidiyon kii daal-roti kaa jugad bhi kar chuke hai
 Which shows the benefits of becoming a party to Babri Masjid
 nishkarsh ke taur par kaha ja saktaa he ki muslim pakshakaron ke liye ram janmabhumi vivaad siyasat kaa jariya he
 Which he does not want to let go at any cost
 kya hindu pakshakaar ye kabool kar lenge ki supreme court babari masjid ke paksh main faisla suna denge or agar supreme court kaa faisla ram mandir ke khilaaf aayaa to hindu pakshakaar kya karenge
 
 
 Will the Hindu parties accept the verdict against them? 
 
 ?isi silsile main ajtak kii special invastigeshan team kii agali mulaakaat huitrilokinath pandese jo supreme court main ramalala nyaas kii taraf se ram janmabhumi cese main pakshakaar hai
 Triloki Nath Pandey lives in Karsevak Puram in Ayodhya
 trilokinath pandeya- jaj faisla kyon nahin dete hai
 
 77 saal kyon laga
 
 aapse main puch rahaa hum
 
 ?reporter - ji nahin
 
 hamako jaankaree nahin he
 
 kyon nahin de rahe hai?trilokinath pandeya - ab samay iskaa uttar degaa
 
 hamase mat kahalawaiye bhagwaan
 
 kuch niyat hogi
 
 is desh ke vishay main kuch nirnay karne ke liye
 
 lekin ye tay he ki hindu samaaj ram janmabhumi par koi samjhauta nahin karegaa
 The temple will definitely be built whether Huk and Krukayani Muslim parties will not accept the verdict against themselves and Hindu parties will not accept the verdict against themselves, but what will the Hindu parties do if the Supreme Court verdict comes against them
 is sawaal ke jawaab main trilokinath pandey ne samvidhan badal daalane ke mansoobey jaahir kar die
 
 
 Reporter - Suppose Sir, the Supreme Court's decision has come and Muslims have been given the right to build a mosque, at that place, then they will start building it
 
 Trilokinath Pandey - How to make it
 
 Will go to public court 
 Reporter - There will be law, police and administration with them to get it done
 
 Trilokinath Pandey - Somebody will stand with us
 
 Public makes police stand up
 
 People make the constitution public
 
 Public makes government
 
 New constitution will be made, new police will be formed, new court will be formed, new system will stand
 
 In the Supreme Court, Trilokinath Pandey, a party advocate of Ram temple, claims that no Hindu will accept any decision against Ram temple
 
 And there will be uproar in the whole country
 
 
 reporter - supreme court ke order ko hindu nahin maanegaa ?trilokinath pandeya - nahin maanegaa
 
 reporter - or aap kah rahe hai uski jagah phir ek jaise dharm sansad hai, aise hi ek dharm nyaayalay bhi hoga?trilokinath pandeya - nahin, dharm nyaayalay nahin hoga
 
 nayaa samvidhan hoga
 
 nayaa uthal-puthal aayega duniya main
 
 reporter - phir to desh main hangaamaa ho jayega
 
 trilokinath pandeya - ho jaae
 
 desh chahega to hoga
 
 trilokinath pandeya kaa daawa he ki ram mandir ke aade aane vaali har aadchan ko dur kar diya jayega
 
 
 But when Aaj Tak's undercover reporter asked why the Ram temple could not be built in the Vajpayee government, he told an anecdote
 
 
 trilokinath pandeya - atal ji kii sarkaar ke baad, sarkaar main hi
 
 atal ji or adwani ji se ashok singhl kii baatcheet band ho gai or jivan paryant bolchaal nahin hui
 
 reporter - vajah ?trilokinath pandeya - dekhie tay hua ki atal ji kii sarkaar ko 5 varsh chalaanaa he
 
 reporter - 2004 tak ?trilokinath pandeya - lekin santon ke andar ye kautuhal paidaa hua ki atal ji ke raaj main kyon mandir kii charchaa nahin ho rahi he
 
 ashok ji ne atal ji se kaha ki adhikrut kshetra he, usamen 45 acre jameen ram janmabhumi nyaas kii he
 
 usamen se ek acre jameen hamako de dijiye
 
 
 The stone which is ready for us, which we should put there so that in the eyes of the world, it seems that this government is stirring something
 
 Reporter - Who said this sir? Trilokinath Pandey - Ashok ji
 
 Reporter - Ashok ji
 
 Trilokinath Pandey - Atal went to court
 
 Supreme court
 
 Reporter - Atal Ji
 
 Trilokinath Pandey - And the bench of 5 judges said that this cannot happen
 
 It cannot be any kind of transaction, worship, ritual in it
 
 So Ashok ji said to Atal ji, now the Supreme Court has banned
 
 Now taking the name of Ram Janmabhoomi will be contested
 
 We have been working in the social zone for a long time
 
 i have come to suggest that the Bill of Ram Janmabhoomi should be brought
 
 Bill will fall
 
 But the government will also fall
 
 Will go among the public on this subject and may come to government with absolute majority
 
 Reporter - is it 2001? Trilokinath Pandey - No, it's 2003
 
 Advani was sitting there
 
 Advani Ji said that the government would not sacrifice for a temple wall
 
 Reporter - Advani ji said? Trilokinath Pandey - The claims and revelations of Trilokinath Pandey, the Hindu party in the Jeeram Janmabhoomi case, suggest that if the Supreme Court has not ruled in favor of Ram temple, the Hindu organizations can go on the Khilafat
 
 
 hamaari agali mulakatsantoshi akhaade ke mahant saurabh dasse hui
 
 
 According to Mahant Saurabh Das, Santoshi Akhara is a branch of Nirmohi Akhara and Nirmohi Akhara is another party in Ram Janmabhoomi case
 saurabh das ne ajtak ke khufia camere par daawa kiya ki agar faisla haq main nahin aayaa to bhi kisi bhi keemat par ram mandir banakar hi rahegaa
 How will this happen? ye aap khud mahant saurabh das kii jubaani sun lijiye
 
 
 Reporter - If the decision does not come in your favor, then what is the preparation for it? Saurabh Das - Then the people who are older than us will prepare it
 
 Reporter - they'll tell you, you'll do it? Saurabh Das - we have to do that
 
 Reporter - The Mahant, the saint who would say
 
 Saurabh Das - will complete their cooperation
 
 With body and mind
 
 Reporter - whether he asks you to carry out a violent agitation? Saurabh Das - it is a later matter
 
 That is, like the Muslim parties, the Hindu parties have given their verdict on the Supreme Court's decision on Ram Janmabhoomi
 
 
 jab faisle ko lekar supreme court main abhi tak sunwaayee kii taarikh tak tay nahin hui he
 
 
 Seeing the revelations of Operation Ram Temple, it can be said that both the Hindu parties or the Muslim parties have nothing to do with the Supreme Court's decision
 ye wo log hai jinhone aasthaa ke vishay ko bhi politics or power kaa khel bana diya he
 It is considered a duty to expose such people till date
 kyonki ye jaruri nahin he ki sach wo hi ho jo aapaki ankhon ke saamne ho
 Sometimes the truth is hidden from your eyes and sometimes it is deliberately hidden
 ajtak ne oparation ram mandir ke jariye ram mandir ko lekar isi chhipe hue sach kaa khulaasa kiya he
 On India Today's 'operation Ram Mandir', Amit Malviya, head of the BJP IT cell, spoke of giving away the undisputed land around the disputed site in Ayodhya to their original owners
 bataa den ki 29 janvari ko, centre sarkaar ram janmabhumi nyaas sahit apane mul maalikon ko nirvivaad rup se 67 acre jameen waapas karne kii anumati ke liye sarvocch nyaayalay kaa rukh kar chuki he
 Malaviya said, "after the decision of the Supreme Court on this matter, it will be up to the state and central governments to execute the court's decision in peace and a Ram temple should be constructed
" vaise bhi, vahaan ki 67 acre jameen nirvivaad he
 This is just a small part of which there is a dispute
 'haalanki, vishwa hindu parishad (vihip) ne kadi pratikriya di
 VHP spokesperson Sriraj Nair claimed that his organization was law-abiding, but approved nothing less than the Ram temple on the disputed land
 unhone kaha, "ham yahaan keval ek mandir ke liye nahin lard rahe hai
 Who dares to remove the deities from the so-called disputed site
 yah ek mandir he or hameshaa ek mandir rahegaa
 "activist and Islamic scholar Asad Khan Falahi spoke of legally resolving the issue
" unhone kaha, 'pakshakaar antim shabd nahin he

 Mahmud Pracha, a member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, reiterated Falahi
 unhone kaha, 'bharat main, bharat kaa samvidhan hi prabal hoga
 i may not be happy with the decision of the Supreme Court but i have to accept that decision

 Whoever does this, we will suppress his voice in a legal way

 This morning (monday), Alsayee Delhi was not yet awake from the sleep that the murder of an elderly doctor in Jahangirpuri area caused sensation in the area
 65 saal ke bujurg doctor mukeem kilashunke hi ghar main padi mili or kamare ke andar sara saamaan bikharaa hua tha
 The elderly doctor Mukim lived with his daughter in the h block house of Jahangirpuri
 beti subah 7:00 baje apane skool padhaane ke liye chali gai or doctor mukeem ghar par akele the
 When the maid working in the house arrived at around 10 o'clock, she saw that the goods were in disarray and the doctor Mukim Keelashpadi was nearby
 laash ke paas ek bada sa chaaku bhi padaa tha, lekinhatyachaaku se nahin kii gai thi
 The daughter's engagement took place two days ago, and the police suspects that the doctor has been murdered
 2 din pehle hi doctor mukeem kii beti kii sagaai hui thi or 9 disambar ko uski shaadi honi thi
 The police suspect that due to the wedding, some cash and jewelery must have been in the house, which the killer must have been aware of and the killer must have entered the house to rob him
 police jab maukey par pahunchi to kamare kaa darwaja khulaa hua tha
 Police suspect that a friendly entry has taken place in the house

 Married women in India wear red clothes
 jise suhaag kii nishaani mana jaataa he
 According to the survey conducted earlier, women dressed in red dress consider men to be more attractive in terms of sex
 mahilaon kaa bhi maananaa he ki saamaajik jamaavade main laal rang ke kapade main saji mahilaon se ve khatra mahasoos karti hai
 They believe that women in red dress in search of sex

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special news letter rajyasabha saansad ram jethmalani ne bijepi adhyaksh nitin gadakari ke khilaaf morcha khol diya he
 Jethmalani on Tuesday demanded BJP President Nitin Gadkari's resignation
 jethmalani ne gadakari ko salaah di he ki wo party ke hit main or svachh jaanch hone tak party ke adhyaksh pad ko chhod den
 Ram Jethmalani said, 'please resign till Nitin Gadkari completes the investigation
 istipha dene se koi doshi sabit nahin hota he
 Jethmalani made this strong statement a day after the resignation of his son Mahesh Jethmalani
 gauratlab he ki mahesh jethmalani ne nitin gadakari ke aaropon main ghire rahane ke baavjood party adhyaksh pad par bane rahane ke virodh main rashtriya kaaryakarini se somvaar ko hi istipha de diya he
 Ram Jethmalani has termed Nitin Gadkari's comparison of Dawood with Swami Vivekananda as irrelevant and termed it a "nonsense"
 unhone kaha ki agar gadakari party kaa hit chaahate hai to unhen istipha de dena chahie
 Ram Jethmalani said that the bjp's top leadership wants to remove Gadkari from the post of president but no one is speaking openly
 jethmalani ne daawa kiya ki yashavanth sinha, jaswant singh or shatrughna sinha unke sampark main hai or unhen ummid he ki wo bhi gadakari se khush nahin hai
 Ram Jethmalani said that no one in the party has opposed his stand on Gadkari
 pradhanmantri pad ke liye apane pasandida ummidavaar ke bare main poochne par jethmalani ne kaha, ‘rahul gandhi ko main raajnneeti main anpadh maanata hum
 Do you remember any important quote from Rahul in the last 10 years
 haa, nitish kumaar eemaandaar or safal mukhyamantri rahe hai or endie ke saath bane rahe to sambhavit ummidavaar ho sakate hai
 But in my view, Narendra Modi is the best candidate
 ’bijepi ke rajyasabha saansad ram jethmalani ne kareeb do hafte pehle hi nitin gadakari ko salaah di thi ki wo aaropon ke alok main bijepi adhyaksh pad ke liye dobaaraa nahin khadey hon

 har taraf faile bade bangale
 
 
 Sometimes the proximity of the bungalows gives new companions for the battle of Raisina Hill, sometimes even though the proximity of the bungalows for this fight, there are distances in the hearts
 
 
 1 janvari, 2004 ko sonia gandhi apane bangale 10, janpath se nikalakar paidal chal di thim 12, janpath main rahane vaale apane padosi ramvilas paswan ke ghar
 
 
 On the first day of the new year, he joined hands with the neighbor and laid the foundation of the UPA and after five months sent a veteran like Atal Bihari Vajpayee to 7, Race Course Road to 6, A
 Krishna Menon Marg
 
 
 isi lutian dilli main ek baar phir brihaspativaar kaa din paswan ke naam rahaa
 
 
 Travel from Janpath to Ashok Road
 
 
 narendra modi ke liye siem se piem tak kaa ummiido-bharaa safar
 
 
 For Paswan, the journey from 'communalism' to 'secularism' and then 'communalism'
 
 
 raajnneeti kaa vicitra sanyog dekhie
 
 
 All this happened on the day, just twelve years before, when the Sabarmati train was lit in Godhra, Gujarat, after which there were riots in the state, in view of which Ram Vilas Paswan demanded Atal Bihari Vajpayee to remove Narendra Modi after a few months
 Resigned from the government
 
 
 haalanki jaankaar kehete hai ki paswan isliye naaraaz the, kyonki unase doorsanchaar mantralay chin liya gaya tha
 
 
 However, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has hunted down two birds with one stone by joining hands with Ram Vilas Paswan
 
 
 bihar main nitish kumaar ke saath 17 saal chalaa gathbandhan saamaajik aadhaar par kaaphi majboot tha, lekin nitish ke jane ke baad endie se kuch pichhadi or ati-pichhadi jatiyaan, mahadalit or pasmanda muslim chhitak gaye
 
 
 BJP realizes that if it wants to win a large number of Lok Sabha seats in the state, apart from Modi's name, social engineering will also have to be taken care of
 
 
 party netaaon kaa daawa he ki rajya main modi kii hawa he, lekin khud narendra modi kehete hai ki agar tair ko hawa main lekar khadey ho jaao to usamen apane-aap hawa nahin bhar jaati
 
 
 The air in the tire will be filled only when the polling booth is worked and people are brought to the polling booths
 
 
 yani, ishaara saaf he ki bijepi ko apane voton kaa pratishat badhaane ke liye saamaajik dayera badhanaa jaruri he
 
 
 So, the party has done this by joining hands with Paswan in Bihar
 
 
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko nitish ke saath rahakar 14 fisadi vot mili the, jabaki paswan ko lalu prasad yadav ke saath rahakar kareeb saat fisadi vot
 
 
 Interestingly, in an alliance with Lalu, Paswan had a chance to contest 12 of the 40 seats, but could not win a single one
 
 
 bijepi ke saath gathbandhan kii neenv rakhane vaale paswan ke bete chiraag anaupchaarik charchaaon main kehete hai ki lalu prasad ne parde ke peeche khel khelaa or apane yadav voton ko paswan ke paas nahin jane diya, jabaki paswan ne har seat par apane samarthakon ke vot argedy ko dilwaaye
 
 
 This allegation has also dominated the breakdown of relationship with Lalu
 
 
 bijepi netaaon kaa maananaa he ki kareeb 15 siten aisi hai, jahaan pachaas hajaar se do lakh tak paswan vot hai
 
 
 By the way, whether Paswan or Mayawati, both of them have the ability to transfer the votes of their Dalit supporters
 
 
 lihaaza paswan or upendra kushvaha ke saath bijepi 30 fisadi kaa nirnaayak aankada paar kar sakati he, isiilie usne bihar main ab saamaajik nyaay kaa ek bahurangi gathbandhan taiyaar kar liya he
 
 
 The BJP seems to be benefiting from this alliance at the national level
 
 
 use lag rahaa he ki paswan ke saath aane se narendra modi kii sampradayik chhavi ko lekar sambhavit sahyogiyon kii soch badalegi or chunaav se pehle or chunaav ke baad in dalon kii bijepi se judane kii jhijak dur hogi
 
 
 The BJP is now eyeing Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal, Naveen Patnaik in Odisha and Assam Gana Parishad in Assam
 
 
 assam main uskaa agypi se chunaav purv gathbandhan bhi sambhav he, to vahiin tiemasi or bijedy ke saath use chunaav ke baad samarthan milane kii ummid he
 
 
 Talk is going on with MDMK, PMK and DMDK in Tamil Nadu
 
 
 or paswan ke saath gathbandhan hone ke 12 ghanton ke bheetar hi diemke pramukh em karunanidhi kaa bayaan bhi aa gaya he, jisamen unhone narendra modi kii jamkar tarif kii he
 
 
 So, the BJP feels that an alliance with Paswan will work in its favor
 
 
 vaise bhi lutian dilli main paswan ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki jidhar hawa bah rahi hoti he, paswan vahiin hote hai

 According to the information received from the sources, the Road Transport Ministry has made a list of some such dangerous national highways in the country, in which incidents of crime continue to occur
 in sadakon par jab bhibadi ghatnahoti he to sarkaar or suraksha agenciyon par sawaal uthte rahete hai

 It is a bit annoying nowadays, because he is not able to recognize new notes of 2000 and 500 rupees easily
 sarkaar kaa daawa he ki nae noton main netraheenon kii suvidha ke liye vishesh praavdhaan kiye gaye hai
 The comments 500 ke note ke kinare kuch ubhari hui 5 lakeeren di gai hai, jabaki 2000 ke note ke kinare ubhari hui 7 lakeeren hai
 But in reality the blind are not able to identify these new notes easily, because the ridges of the lines in these notes are very light
 in ubhaaron ko mahasoos karne main netraheenon ko samasya aa rahi he
 Rajeev claims that Braille has more bulge of letters, so that those letters are understood, but in new notes, these bulges are much less
 unka kahana he ki nae noton kii lakiron ke ubhaar ko braille ke ubhaaron ke saath talmail karke chapa janaa chahie tha
 There are 5 raised ridges along the side of the 500 note, while there are 7 ridges embossed on the side of the 2000 note
 lekin hakeekat main netraheen aasaani se in nae noton kii pahchaan nahin kar paa rahe hai, kyonki in noton main lakiron kaa jo ubhaar he, vah behad halkaa he
 Visually impaired are experiencing problems in sensing these bulges
 rajeev kaa daawa he ki braille main aksharon kaa ubhaar zyada hota he, jisase wo akshar samaj jate hai, lekin nae noton main ye ubhaar kaaphi kam hai
 He says that the emergence of new note lines should have been printed in sync with the braille highlights

 The Union Cabinet approved the bill on 17 July

 It is said that this will repeal the Indian Medical Council Act 1956
 chikitsa ayog nijee medical collejon or dimd vishvavidhyalayon main 50 fisadi siton ke liye sabhi shulkon kaa niyaman karegaa
 Which is expected to reduce the entry fee
 kyon ho rahaa is bill par hangaamaa?neshnal medical bill ke 32wein praavdhaan ke tahat community health prowiders ko marijon ko davaaiyaan likhane or ilaaj kaa license milegaa
 While doctors object to this because it will endanger the lives of patients
 is bill main ek praavdhaan yah bhi he ki ayurveda-homeopathy doctor brij course karke allopathic ilaaj kar paaenge
 While doctors say that this will give a boost to quacks and hawks
 privet medical collejon ko 50 fisadi siton kii fees tay karne kaa haq milegaa
 While doctors say that this will lead to corruption in private medical colleges
 praavdhaan ke anusaar padhai puri karne ke baad practice shuru karne ke liye doctoron ko ek test paas karnaa hoga
 On the other hand, doctors say that once the test fails, there is no option to give the test again

 Rajasthan is not taking the name of the calm calm in the BJP over the post of state president
 is bavaal main ab bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah kaa faisla bhi dagamagane laga he
 About 15 ministers of Rajasthan are camping in Delhi against the creation of BJP state president Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat
 saath hi bijepi ke jat or duusare jati ke vidhayak bhi dilli main jaakar kendriya netritv ke faisle ke khilaaf bijepi netaaon ko samajhane main lage hai
 At the same time, it is being told that the central leadership of the BJP is not in the mood to make a splash on this matter anymore
 isliye mangalvaar ko rajasthan main bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh kii ghoshnaa kar di jaaegi
 It is also being said that the central leadership has almost made it clear that Minister of State for Agriculture Gajendra Singh will be the BJP state president of Rajasthan
 jitani jaldbaaji main kendriya netritv main rajasthan bijepi adhyaksh ashok paranami kaa istipha liya tha utana hi nae adhyaksh ko banane main deree ho rahi he
 As soon as it was reported in Rajasthan that Union Minister of State for Agriculture Gajendra Singh could be made the state president of BJP

 yah pehla mauka he jab bijepi kaa kendriya netritv kisi rajya main khud ke str par naam tay karne ke baavjood use ghoshit nahin kar paa rahaa he
 The main reason for this is the opposition of Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje

 It is being said that the central leadership feels that Gajendra Singh has been associated with the RSS for a long time
 bijepi kekaddavar netaa rahe bhairon singh shekhavat kii tarah yah bhi gajendra singh shekhavat he
 But the state leaders feel that Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje is also a Rajput
 pradesh adhyaksh bhi agar rajput ho gaya to baaki jatiyaan naaraaz ho jaaegi or bijepi kaa chunaav jeetna mushkil ho jayega
 At the same time, the son of Union Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal went on the page of BJP National President Amit Shah and wrote that if Gajendra Singh Shekhawat was made the President, the Congress would get 140 seats

 The Aam Aadmi Party chief made this statement at Visakhapatnam Airport before leaving for Delhi
 kejariwal kaa kahana tha ki congress ke saath koi gathbandhan nahin he
 We had a meeting with Rahul Gandhi, where he refused to ally with the AAP
 congress kii dilli ikai kii adhyaksh shila dikshit ke bayaan ki AAP ne unki party se sampark nahin kiya' par unhone kaha, "agar hamane unase (rahul) baat kar lee he to kisi or se baat karne kii koi jarurat nahin he, kisi bhi surat main, vah ek junior leader hai
 "former Delhi Chief Minister Sheili Dixit has also denied an alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party

 Credit card companies have attracted people to make expensive purchases by placing a higher spending limit on the card
 aksar inkaa puraa bhugtan nirdhaarit samay tak nahin ho paata or credit carddharakon ko yaa to chakree rin lenaa padataa he yaa shesh raashi ko iemi main badalawaanaa hota he
 If you are in a position to liquidate the balance by the next due date, then there is nothing wrong with cyclical debt, if you are not in a position to pay this balance in the near future, it is better to convert it to EMI
 quebera
 "technically, the dues on the card (not just that big purchase amount) can be converted into EMI," says Aditya Kumar, founder and CEO of Com
 aise main bank parivartit shesh par nishchit dar se byaaj lagaate hai
 When compared to using a cyclical loan by paying minimum dues, the amount of interest increases and the option of converting to EMI is much cheaper
 indiyalends ke sansthaapak or mukchay adhishasi gaurav chopra kehete hai, ''iemi main badalawaane par teen kaarak rin par byaaj kii dar ko prabhavit karte hai: (a) rin praapt karta kii credit profile (ba) rin kii avadhi or (sa) bank kii aantarik nitiyaan
 Normally, these loans converted to EMI after credit card transactions are charged at the rate of 14 to 21 per cent per annum, while the interest rate on the credit card is about 42 per cent
 lekin iemi main parivartan ke vikalp sabhi maamalon main ek jaise nahin hote or unki kul laagat main kaaphi antar hota he
 If you use credit cards often for large purchases, then it is better to consider the costs of converting unpaid dues to EMI
 iemi main parivartit karwaane kaa faisla lete samay keval kam byaaj dar par dhyaan na dekar processing shulk par bhi dhyaan den
 Processing fees play a major role in total repayment in short-term loans
 mani tap ke sah-sansthaapak tathaa mukhya parichaalan adhikari anuj kakkad kehete hai, ''aapako iemi par byaaj ke saath hi 18 pratishat kii dar se jiesti or processing shulk kaa bhugtan karnaa hota he
 In this way, you have to pay additional charges and GST in case the loans converted in this manner are repaid ahead of schedule
 '' aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki kam byaaj dar dikhaa rahe kisi credit card par aapako duusare se zyada processing shulk dena pad rahaa ho (graphic dekhen)
 Most credit cards offer the option of payment in three to 24 months
 lekin, unki byaaj dar samaan nahin hoti
 Kakkar says, "the longer the period, the higher the interest rate
 '' alag-alag card alag-alag graahakon ko bilkul alag byaaj daron kaa prastaav kar sakate hai
 It is better to find the options for change in EMI and compare the total cost incurred on them

 The Shiv Sena says that the chief minister's post should be distributed for two-and-a-half years
 lekin bijepi ne kaha ki aisi kisi sthiti par samjhauta nahin hua
 After this, the 30-year-old friendship broke down and the Shiv Sena's attitude became strong

 Later, the Congress said that at present, no support letter has been given to the Shiv Sena

 After this, the governor invited NCP to form the government and at night, NCP chief Sharad Pawar called Uddhav Thackeray and said that he is ready to form government with Shiv Sena

 This dramatic incident between Mamata and the Modi government began when the team of CBI officers who went to her residence for the purpose of questioning Kumar were stopped by sentries-personnel stationed there
 iske baad kolkata police ne sibiai ke kuch adhikariyon ko hiraasat main bhi le liya
 This was an unprecedented situation of confrontation between the police forces of the Center and the state

 Please save India, save democracy, save the Constitution
 ' mamata ne sabhi vipakshi partiyon se apil kii ki ve modi sarkaar ko satta se bedakhal karne ke liye ekajute hon
 Apart from the Army, he also called for the security forces of the Center and states to 'condemn' the attitude of the Modi government

 CBI joint director Pankaj Srivastava said, "we went there to interrogate him (kumar) and investigate
" or yadi unhone sahyog nahin kiya hota, to ham unhen hiraasat main le lete
 According to the CBI, Kumar, a 1989 batch West Bengal cadre IPS officer who led the SIT set up by the West Bengal Police to investigate the chit fund scams, has to be questioned regarding missing documents and files, but he has appeared before the investigating agency Has not responded to notices issued to lokapal vidheyak par mangalvaar ko loksabhaa main charchaa se pehle sarkaar ne iske liye samarthan jutaney kii mashkkat kii vahiin bhaajapa or vam dalon ne isamen sanshodhan prastaav laane par jor diya
 Describing all the UPA allies as united, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal said that other political parties should not introduce the amendment as it has been prepared after due consideration
 unka kahana tha ki kanoon banane kii prakriya sthir nahin he or jab bhi koi anubhav saamne aata he isamen baad main badlaav kiye ja sakate hai
 He said that all political parties should accept that for the first time in 40 years, a bill on the issue of Lokpal has reached the level of discussion in Parliament
 bansal ne in atakalon ko khaarij kar diya ki congress ne isliye teen line kii vip jari kar sabhi saansadon ko mangalvaar ko loksabhaa main maujuud rahane ke liye kaha he kyonki vah ghabaraai hui he
 He said that this is a legitimate process

 Actually JNU Students' Union President Mohit Pandey has not got registration in the monsoon semester
 mohit pandey ke saath hi united obisi forum ke chaatr dilip kaa bhi panjikaran jeenyu ne roak diya he
 According to the JNU administration, "before the start of the monsoon semester, a notice was issued to all the students to appeal that the students who were fined by the JNU administration should pay the fine before the new semester
 aisa nahin karne vaale chaatro ko monsoon semester main daakhila nahin diya jayega
 "despite this, the JNU Students' Union president did not pay the fine, so the administration had to stop Mohit's registration for the monsoon semester following the rules
 prashasan ke mutabik baar-baar soochna dene ke baad bhi chaatro ne jurmaana nahin bharaa
 According to student union president Mohit Pandey, the JNU administration wants to suppress the voice of the students' union
 mohit par jeenyu prashasan ne kareeb 20 hajaar rupaye kaa jurmaana thonka he
 Also, about 6 inquiries are going on in different cases, 2 firs are also registered
 mohit ne jeenyu prashasan par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki ye puri kavayad unhen campus se baahar nikaalane kii he
 Preventing a student from registering means killing his / her academic
 mohit ne ye saaf kar diya he ki beshak ye semester unka aakhri semester he, lekin iske baavjood wo jurmaana nahin bharenge or jeenyu prashasan ke khilaaf apana sangharsh jari rakhenge
 Let us tell you that the JNU administration has taken various cases such as illegal occupation of the Admin block, hostage of VC and senior officials, videography in Academic Council meeting and protests on the banned Admin Block on the issue of mphil-phd

 On Friday, the JNU Students' Union, while sharing photos from outside the admin, tweeted that the administration did not allow the meeting to come in and out of the gate
 jeenyu chaatro kaa aaropahai ki wo apane adhyaksh mohit pandey ke panjikaran ke masale par jeenyu prashasan se milanaa chaahate hai, lekin prashasan baithak bulaakar bhi milane ko raji nahin he
 The JNU administration has its own arguments on this matter
 mohit pandey ke twit ke baad hi rector 2 professor satish ne bhi ek twit kiya
 According to which this meeting was called to discuss the issues related to the students in the new semester, in which only three office bearers of the students' union were called, because Mohit Pandey is not currently a JNU registered student
 lekin baaki ke padaadhikari bhi get par ad gaye ki mohit ke bina wo baithak kaa hissaa nahin banenge
 The JNU administration waited for the students for about 40 minutes but they did not come
 saaf he ki jeenyu prashasan or chaatrasangh ke bich mohit pandey ke panjikaran ko lekar ek nayaa vivaad tool pakad rahaa he
 In support of Mohit, the JNU Students' Union has decided to hold a university strike and protest on Monday

" Have to go but stand with your brothers, take some trouble

 “kairana is a communally sensitive area
 kuch saal pehle yah jagah khabaron main thi kyonki aisi report ai thi ki muslimon ke dar se hindu kairana chhod rahe the
 Muslims in Kairana are believed to be above 60 per cent of the population

 Azam Khan said that even after 1947, Muslims are serving a sentence
 agar musalmaan pakistan chale jate to unhen yah sajaa nahin milti
 If Muslims are here, they will have to face the punishment of mob litching

 What will happen now will have to be endured unhone kaha hamaare purvaj pakistan kyon nahin gaye? yah moulana aaazaad, jawaharlal nehru, sardaar patel or baapu se puuchhen

 Regarding the reasons for the breakdown of mobile customers, the official said that BSNL could not compete with the rampant marketing strategy of private companies

 The Delhi High Court is also one of them
 All the decisions that have come from here have been seen as examples for the whole country, but the sad aspect of this is that the Delhi High Court has almost half the number of judges, due to which there are about 71,000 cases pending in the court
 yun todilli hoikorapani sthapana ke 50 saal 2016 main hi puure kar chukaa he
 For any institution, so many years are enough to strengthen it, but even after so many years, the Delhi High Court has not got as many judges as have been given by the government
 jaj kam, bad rahe lambit maamledillihoicourtko nyaayik prakriya sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye 60 jajon kii manjuuri mili hui he, lekin philhal hoicourt kareeb-kareeb aadhe yani sirf 33 jajon kii sankhya se hi kaam chalaa rahaa he or uskaa nateeja he ki dinon din badhate lambit maamle
 The High Court currently has 71,000 cases awaiting its trial
 pichley 35 saal se vakaalat kar rahe vakil ashok agarwal kehete hai ki 80 saal kaa vruddh jab court ko kahata he ki vah pichley 20-25 saal secsalad rahaa he, uski umr ko dhyaan main rakhkar cese ko jald khatm kiya jaae to court kahata he ki aapke vaaris maujuud hai court se aae faisle se unako phayda jarur hoga philhal hamaari nyaay vyavastha kii sthiti aisi he
 The number of judges is half the impact on decisions, so it directly affects the decisions that are made
 aksar maamalon mensunwaayeejajon ko jaldi-jaldi puri kerani padati he or kai baar sunwaayee kii taarikh ek saal baad mil paati he jiske chalate naa sirf vakil dabaav main rahete hai balki iskaa bura asar jajon ke kaamkaaj par bhi padataa he
 Advocate Pankaj Gupta says that as the cases grow in the diary of the judge and the lawyer, the pressure automatically doubles
 agar ek vakil ke taur par meri capicity din main chaar cese handle karne kii he, lekin mujhe 10 maamle handle karne pade to nishchit rup se dabaav badhegaa
 Waiting for Chief Justice in High Court: For the last one year, Delhi High Court has been waiting for its Chief Justice
 philhal gita mittal acting chif justise kii bhoomika nibhaa rahi hai
 By August, two more judges will retire from the High Court
 ek jaj ke paas ausatan 2 hajaar cese pending he
 Every day a judge has to hear 100 to 150 cases
 lagbhag do dashak se vakaalat kar rahe shashaank dev kehete hai ki jab jaj hi nahin honge to sochie nyaay kaise milegaa, maamalon main sunwaayee kaise hogi or cese main jald nipataara kaise sambhav he
 In such a situation, it is not difficult to guess how much the judges themselves work under pressure and the problem of the general public is not hidden from us, who spend millions of years and wait for years only for a court order

 shailendra pandeya - jyotishi The United States plans to sell 145 state-of-the-art 155mm Howitzer cannons valued at $ 647 million to India to strengthen bilateral and strategic alliances with India

 The government took a good step by announcing the Bharat Ratna award to Sachin Tendulkar on the day of his departure from cricket, but it also opened up a box of controversies
 yun to aaj tak kii voting main hamane dekha ki lagbhag 68 pratishat log sachin ko yah sarvocch sammaan dene ke paksh main the
 But it is also important for about 32 percent people to disagree
 sachin tendulkar kii khel ke maidan main jo uplabdhiyaan hai uske liye unhone kaaphi kuch paaya bhi
 He was well received as one of India's most loved sportsman, but also received immense wealth
 ve ek aise brand ban gaye, jisaki khel kii duniya main koi sani nahin
 Every big company wanted the endorsement of their brand from Sachin and was willing to pay for it
 natijatan sachin tendulkar duniya ke sabase dhanadhy khilaadiyon main shumaar ho gaye
 Forbes magazine ranked Sachin at number 51 in the list of world's wealthiest players
 matlab saaf he ki sachin ne desh ko jitna diya, usase kam unhen nahin mila
 But remember the hockey wizard Dhyanchand
 hockey kaa yah vilakshan khilaadi dhyaan chand niswaarth bhav se kheltaa rahaa, shoharat or dhan se dur
 There was nothing in his life except hockey
 dhyanchand ko hockey ke jaadugar ke rup main janaa jaataa tha
 In his career he scored a total of 1,000 goals which many cannot think of today
 inamen se 101 gol to olympic khelon main daage gaye the
 The whole world was surprised by watching Dhyan Chand's game
 na jane kitne bade logon ne unki prashansa kii
 It will be surprising to the fans of cricket that Don Bradman himself said that after watching Dhyan Chand's game, he scored goals like scoring runs
 unhone antarrashtriya hockey toornamenton main kai mahatvapurn jeet dilaakar paradheen bharat kaa sammaan badhaayaa
 Despite so many achievements, Dhyanchand could not get the respect he deserved
 unhone na to kabhi dhan kii chahat kii or na sammaan kii
 He lacked money, suffered from illness and looked up to him, while he was popular abroad, his life-size statue was erected in Austria and a station was also named after him in England
 unhone ni:swaarth bhav se hockey kii seva kii or ritairement ke baad bhi bacchon ko muft main hockey sikhaate rahe
 All the reasons exist to give Bharat Ratna to this son of Mother India
 sarkaar ne sachin ko samay rahete hue bharat ratna dekar acha kiya, lekin dhyanchand kii shandaar uplabdhiyon ko use bhoolanaa nahin chahie
 Instead of taking advantage of the wave of popularity, he should have thought in the interest of sports and should not ignore a superhero
 centre sarkaar ne fasebuk, twitor jaisi soshal netwarking site ko chetavanee di he ki ve apni site se 'aapattijanak' samagriyaan hataa len, varanaa sarkaar is disha main kadam uthaaegi
 Due to this attitude of the government, there is a fear of banning these sites among the internet lovers and voices have also started raising their opposition
 kendriya sanchaar evam soochna praudyogiki mantri kapil sibbal ne soshal netwarking site ko yah chetavanee somvaar ko fasebuk, twitor, utyub or microsoft ke pratinidhiyon ke saath hui baithak main di
 Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Sibal said, "the materials posted on the site are hurting the religious sentiment and respect of dignitaries of many communities
 " unhone kaha, "kisi bhi saarvajanik vyakti kii vyangyatmak tasviir kaa koi bura nahin maanata, lekin yadi aap mujhe ek nishchit rup main dikhaaenge to yah sweekaar nahin he
 Other people should also be protected
 " sibbal ne yah bhi kaha ki soshal netwarking site ke adhikariyon se unhone pehali baar paanch sitambar ko mulaakaat kar site par iske istemaalkartaaon dwaara aapattijanak saamagree daale jane ko lekar sarkaar kii chintaaon se avgat karaayaa tha
 He said, "they have to give us the figures
 iske baad ham kadam uthaaenge
 We will ask them to provide information
 isse nipatane ke liye hamen samay den
 But one thing is clear that we will not allow such materials
 " sibbal ne haalanki yah nahin kaha ki sarkaar is disha main kya kadam uthaa sakati he
 Meanwhile, representatives of the social networking site have raised questions on what content will be 'objectionable', how to decide? They also say that it is difficult to monitor each and every content that is put on the site
 fasebuk kii ore se mangalvaar ko jari bayaan main kaha gaya he, "ham us saamagree ko hataayenge jo hamaari sharton kaa ulanghan karte hai
 These include materials such as hatred, bullying, violence, or a picture of nostalgia
 " company ne yah bhi kaha ki vah is sambandh main centre sarkaar kii chintaaon se waakif he or bhartiya adhikariyon ke saath aage bhi baatcheet karegi
 At the same time, Google said that a distinction needs to be made between controversial and illegal materials
 company ke pravaktaa ne kaha, jo bhi saamagree kanoon ke khilaaf hoti he use team dwaara hataa diya jaataa he
 But if the content is valid despite being controversial, it is not removed, because Google respects all views
 adhikariyon ke anusaar, soshal netwarking site ke pratinidhiyon se paanch sitambar kii sibbal kii mulaakaat main unhen vah tasviir dikhaai gai thi jisamen congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi va pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko galat dhang se dikhaaya gaya he, jabaki kuch anya tasviren dharmik bhaavana aahat karne vaali thim
 This was followed by R
, Secretary, Central Communications Department
 chandrashekhar ne bhi 19 oktober ko in companiyon ke adhikariyon ke saath baithak kii thi or yah nirnay liya gaya tha ki is tarah kii samagriyon ko lekar aachaar samhita banaai jaaegi
 But they verbally agreed to several clauses, but in written reply they did not agree to any of the clauses
 unhone kaha ki ve tabhi koi kadam uthaaengi jab mantralay adaalat kaa aadesh lekar aae
 On the other hand, this attitude of the government has raised fears among internet lovers to ban such a site
 iske virodh main swar bhi uthne lage hai
 Rajya Sabha MP and industrialist Rajiv Chandrasekhar said that Sibal is trying to implement Chinese model of Internet control in India
 lekin vah isamen safal nahin honge
 At the same time, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said on Tuesday that he is against the ban on online materials but he also said that freedom of expression is often misused
 microbloging site twitor par umr ne likhaa, "yadi soshal netwarking website par pratibandh kii pahal hoti he to main abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ke paksh main khadaa hounga, lekin yah un swatantraaaon main se ek he jisane durbhagyavash mujhe chintit kiya he

 Call it a new generation lifestyle or style, but one in four women go on a date only to enjoy free dinner, not with the intention of romance and long relationships

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious bullet train project is to be built in collaboration with Japan
 iske liye donon deshon kii sarkaron ke bich ahm qaraar bhi ho chuke hai, lekin haal hi main japan main ek bada steel scandle hua he
 It has been revealed in this scandal that the steel used for Japan's bullet train is not according to the prescribed standards
 isse yah sawaal uthne laga he ki kya iskaa modi sarkaar ke dream project mumbai-ahmedabad bullate train par bhi koi asar padegaa yaa nahin
 Kobi Steel has been accused of the fact that Japan-based company Kobi Steel Limited has been accused of consuming inferior goods for the bullet train
 company ne ashanka jataai he ki kobi steel ke research centre main kuch chhedchhad kii gai he
 Steel sent by the company was found to be substandard
 isaki khabar media main aane ke baad company ke management ne iske liye maafee bhi maang lee he
 No Security Threats Central Japan Railways and the companies operating the bullet train here, however, have made it clear that there is no security threat
 company kii taraf se bheja gaya steel maanakon par khara nahin utraa he
 The Government of Japan is currently investigating the matter
 bharat ke liye kitna chintajankabharat kii pehali bullate train japan ke sahyog se hi ban rahi he
 In such a situation, after the arrival of the scandal involving the bullet train in Japan, discussions have started in India
 yahaan sawaal uthne lage hai ki is ghotaale kaa bharat par kya asar pad saktaa he
 However, if we look at Japan's Sahayag in India's bullet train project project, it does not seem to have any effect on it
 mek in india par he foksabhaarat kii pehali bullate train taiyaar karne ke liye japan technology or vittiya madad de rahaa he
 Japan has also prepared the blueprint of Indian bullet train
 haalanki bullate train banane ke liye istemaal hone vaale kalpurje or anya chijen swadesh main hi banaai jaaengi
 The Government of India wants to promote the 'make in India' campaign through this
 aise main kobi ke is scandle kaa koi bhi asar bharat par hona na ke baraabar he
 Not unsafe, the subhuman has complaints
 Talking about the scam that surfaced in Japan, it is alleged that the company that used steel for the bullet train is subhuman
 bullate train kaa sanchaalan karne vaali companiyon ne saaf kiya he ki isse bullate train kii suraksha par koi asar nahin padegaa
 India has many options, in the future if the Indian government also asks for steel from Japan, then there are many big Japanese companies apart from Kobi, from which it can take steel
 japan kii steel industry main jeefi holdings samet anya companiyon kii bhagidaari 75 fisadi se bhi zyada he
 Coby Steel is a small part of this industry
 behatar he japan kaa trek recordjapan main chalane vaali bullate train kaa ab tak record he ki isaki vajah se koi haadasa nahin hua he
 Which simply means that the safety standards of the bullet train here are very strict
 bharat main chalane vaali pehali bullate train bhi japan kii takanic ke badaulat banane vaali he
 In this case, looking at Japan's track record, this technology can be trusted

 or shantipurna tareeke se unhen jane dena chahie tha
 This was completely non-essential

" " bhushan ne kaha, "yah puri tarah shantipurna pradarshan tha
 People have the basic right to perform in a peaceful manner
 " unhone kaha, "main baba ramdev kaa samarthak nahin hum lekin main desh ke logon kaa samarthak hum
 i do not agree with what he did but he has raised his voice against corruption

 In this celebration of democracy, colors of election are being seen
 ab pehle kii tarah binar poster or bille chunaav achaar samhita kii vajah se nahin hai
 In these situations, where people are getting their leaders and party's election mark on their backs, they have been seen dancing on the drums while many candidates have been dancing

 Along with the candidates, supporters of different parties are also in different colors

 Apart from this, you will be stunned by seeing the propaganda poster of Samajwadi Party made on the back of Vinod Jaiswal in a totally unique way
 is poster main akhilesh yadav, dimpal yadav, mulaayam singh or unki party kaa chunaav nishaan he or yah sab unhone hameshaa ke liye godane se godwa liya he
 Taking the same mark on both arms, they go out every morning to promote the Samajwadi Party and make people aware of their back posters
 vinod kehete hai ''achaar samhita kaa ulanghan nahin karnaa he, achaar samhita kaa apmaan nahin karnaa he

 Like the leader, the pajama-kurta has put a garland around his neck and Budhu Ram, who is driving a rickshaw, has come to nominate
 budhu rickshaw chaalak hai
 No one listens to the problems of rickshaw drivers, so they made up their mind to contest elections and made nominations of their rickshaw driver fellows sitting on their rickshaws

 '' Seeing this, it is said that in a democracy, elections are a celebration, a festival and all these activities add a unique color to it
 pratyaashiyon ke saath-saath alag-alag partiyon ke samarthak bhi alag-alag rang main hai

 Sri Lanka are upbeat after defeating Canada by 210 runs in their first match
 khud ko khitaab kaa daavedaar maan rahaa srilanka shanivaar ko pakistan ke khilaaf premdasa stadium main bhidega
 This will be his second match
 pakistan ne bhi vishwa cap kaa aagaaj shandaar tareeke se kiya he
 He defeated Kenya by 205 runs on 23 February at the same ground in Hambantota, on which Sri Lanka registered the fifth largest World Cup win in terms of runs

 Pakistan showed a world-class game against Kenya, scoring over 300 runs first and then piling it on 112 runs
 srilanka ne bhi canada ke khilaaf 300 se adhik kaa score khadaa karne ke baad vipakshi team ko 122 ranon par samet diya tha
 Both teams can be given equal status in terms of performance so far, but Sri Lanka have a slightly heavier balance in terms of balance
 srilanka ko is match main gharelu darshakon kaa bharpoor samarthan milegaa
 Sri Lanka is expected to have the highest number of viewers for this match
 srilanka jahaan ballebaaji main pehle match main shatak lagane vaale mahela jayavardhane, tillakaratne dilashaan or captain kumaar sangakaara par nirbhar karegaa, vahiin gendbaaji main use lasith malinga, nuwan kulsekara or star spinner muthaiya muralidharan par bharosa hoga
 Pakistan bowled well after strong batting to match the match
 pakistan ek baar phir kamran akmal, younis khan, umr akmal or misbah ul haq ke boote bada score khadaa karne kaa prayaas karegaa, jabaki gendbaaji main use umr gul, shoeb akhtar or kenya ke khilaaf paanch wicket jhatakane vaale captain shahid afridi kii phiraki par nirbhar rahanaa hoga
 Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Pakistan are expected to reach the final-8 from group-a, but Pakistan and Sri Lanka's effort will be to maintain the winning streak to get the top position in the table, as it will help them in the quarter-finals
 They will face relatively poor teams in Group B

 The Indian team was actually playing a knockout match against South Africa on 11 June 2017 at the Oval in London to make it to the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy
 do din pehle vah isi maidan par srilanka ke khilaaf match haar chuki thi jiske jeetne kii koi ummid nahin thi
 So now it was a fight to do or die
 duniya kii number ek vanade team ke khilaaf is match main bahut kuch daanv par laga tha or maano yahi dabaav kam na ho, media main captain or coach (anil kumble) ke bich takaraav par koharaam machaa hua tha
 The match was of great importance for captain Virat Kohli
 tikhi gendbaaji ke dam par bharat ne yah match aasaani se jeet liya
 And Virat took the responsibility of India's run chase on his shoulders, as he often did throughout the year, and returned after finishing the match on 76 not out

 18th of June 2017, The Oval, London

 Shortly after the end of the match, Kohli started being trolled on social media and started furiously abusing all types of abuses
 itani buree tarah nicha dikhaane ke liye unki khub laanat-malaanat kii gai
 No one was more saddened by this defeat, but the love and hatred of his fans was nothing new for Kohli, who has been playing cricket at the highest level for more than a decade
 ve bakhubi jaanate the ki hindustan main cricketron ko ek din devtaa kii tarah sir par uthaa liya jaataa he or agle hi din shaitan kii tarah dutkaar diya jaataa he
 It turned out that the Champions Trophy was an exception for Virat, the year that was great for him
 2017 ke calendar main 2,818 antarrashtriya ran ab tak ke itihaas main tisare sabase zyada ran hai—or kumaar sangakaara (2,868 ran, 2014 main) ke record se mahaj 46 ran hi kam hai; unhone bataur captain ek ke baad ek lagaataar nau siries jiti hai; or pichley 17 maheenon main chah baar 200 se zyada ranon kaa score banaaya he
 In addition to a high average in all formats of the game, the most convincing evidence of his strength and dominance on the field is that he occupies the number one position in the ICC rankings of both short-over formats and is ranked No
 1 in Tests
 2 par (australia ke steve smith ke baad) hai
 To understand this well, it would be enough to say that no batsman in the world is included in the ICC Top 5 of all three formats
 captain or coach ke bich anban ko bhulaayaa ja chukaa he or saal kaa ant kisi pariktha kii tarah shandaar shaadi se hua he
 Virat Kohli's Metamorphosis, January 2012
 austelian, jaisaa ve aksar karte hai, viraat ko lagaataar khijane main kaamyaab ho gaye the
 He was fed up with the manipulation of the audience and then came up with a cheap way to counter him: he was called a "wanker" (vile or disgusting) by a particularly noisy part of the crowd
 She showed her middle finger in response
 gusse ko nahin sambhaal paanaa shuruaati kohli kii khaasiyat thi or is par chintaa jaahir kii jaati thi ki yah kahin is honhaar ke puri tarah khilakar nikharane ke raste kaa roda na ban jaae
 The story changed completely over the course of two months
 kohli ne dhaka main pakistan ke khilaaf match main match-jitau 183 ran banaae the
 The match ended shortly before midnight
 media badi taadaad main maujuud tha or match kii apni report bhejne se pehle kohli ke soundbite kaa intjaar kar rahaa tha
 The place of the press conference in Mirpur was right in front of the pavilion and one has to cross the entire ground to reach the media yard
 media centre kii taraf jate hue viraat raste main achaanak ruke, mude or stand main apane phens ke ek hisse kii taraf aahista-aahista daudaahe lage
 Some 2,000 spectators stayed after the match and were still shouting "kohli, Kohli" with full enthusiasm
 kai log yah dekhakar hairaan rah gaye ki viraat ne media kaa rukh karne se pehle apane mureedon ko tasveeron or autograph se navajane kaa faisla kiya
 Of course, he was well aware of what he was doing and he even apologized to the media people gathered there as he entered the press conference room
 kayapalat shuru ho chukaa tha
 That aggressive figure of the field would now reveal a new maturity, a new patience and a restraint

 So, listen to Sachin himself, what happened after that, "when i was sitting in the dressing room, i saw Virat coming towards me
 ve mere kareeb pahunche to maine dekha ki unki ankhon main aansu the or unhone ek gift meri taraf badha diya
 Apparently, it was something that was very close to his heart
 unhone kaha ki yah unke dead ne unhen di thi (acchhee takadir ke liye paariwarik viraasat) or ve hameshaa yah sochate rahete the ki ve ise kiske haathon main saunpenge
 i was stunned that they considered me such a rare honor
 ham gale mili, meri ghigghi bandhane lagi or maine viraat se kaha ki isse pehle ki main rone laguun, aap yahaan se chale jaaen
 "this metamorphosis was completed by 2016-17, when Virat took over the captaincy in all three formats of the game

 There was a fear of criticizing the media for criticizing Dhoni and questioning his place in the team

 As the captain of the Indian cricket team, my job is to lead the team with its best abilities

 "yah apane aap main jabardast bharosa he
 Some people mistakenly believe it

 This, and also what Tendulkar calls his "marginal vision", "can read the game very brilliantly and anticipate what is going to happen next in the game
 yahi vah baat he jo use dusron se alag karti he
 "apart from pushing his innings very closely and at the right speed, he can be credited with being forward-looking in cricket in a variety of ways

 In Mohali, Virat, in the footsteps of his compatriot Ravichandran Ashwin, "chased down the Australian total" and set the match at Kolkata on a pitch that was difficult for his bowlers

 jis shaks ne mahaj nau saal main 50 international shatak banaae hai, vah bahut acha khilaadi to hoga hi
 "much has been written about Virat's legacy of growing stature, fitness business, how crazy he is about fitness
 maujuuda bhartiya team jaahir taur par kshetrarakshan ke maamle main khel ke har formet main duniya kii sabase behtareen team he, jisamen viraat kaa fitness mantra is yuva team ke liye maano jivan kaa darshan ban chukaa he

 "they know that a career in sports is short, with only a few good moments
 
 In this sense, they are using their existing influence properly
 maujuuda sthiti kaa akalan kar adarshavaadi viraat utpaadon ke prachaar par apni pakad majboot bana rahe hai, jiskaa matlab he ki apni pasand ko tarjeeh dena or aakarshak prastaavon ko thukraa dena
 His international career reflects his reluctance and impartiality in his dealings with Dhoni in the evening
 purv captain par jab kabhi media hamalaa karata he, to viraat unke bachaav main aage aa jate hai
 He lashed out at the press conference on 8 November, "I don't understand why MSD is being targeted
" " saurabh kehete hai, ''maine jo kuch dekha tha, yah usase alag he
 i love seeing how Virat defends Dhoni
 "charchit shaadi or nai jindagikohali aaj ek celebrity hai or unhone apni vyaktigat or peshewar jindagi ke bich spasht rekha khinch rakhi he
 This was reflected in the grand, but private decision of their wedding at the Tuskeni Heritage Resort in Italy, and their way of expressing commitment, from limiting media access to the event
 shaadi ke baad unhone anginat prashansakon or media ke liye apane daravaaje khol dieh dilli or mumbai main hue do resepshan main italy main media kii gaiyr-maujuudagi kii bharpai kar di
 Like his batting, Virat also takes a lot of time in his life
 unki shaadi uplabdhi bhare saal ke ant main hui, jab captain or coach kaa vivaad kaaphi peeche chhot chukaa tha, vaise bhi yah varsh unke peshewar jivan kaa ab tak kaa saphaltam varsh sabit hua he or is varsh kii vidaai isse behatar bhala kaise ho sakati thi
 There are tough challenges in the new year
 uplabdhiyon ke baavjood viraat kii asli kahani abhi saamne nahin ai he
 a win in any of the tours of South Africa, England and Australia will create an aura of invincibility around them
 kya viraat ko chunautiyon kaa ehsaas he? kya ve yah jaanate hai ki agle 12 maheene main vifaltaa kitni baari pad sakati he? aktubar, 2017 ke aakhir main ai do report, jinamein kohli ke bare main kaaphi kuch likhaa gaya tha, se mujhe pataa chalaa ki unhen is baat kaa ehsaas he
 While one report related to Kohli becoming the world's top sports brand, another report focused on her possible marriage to actress and her partner Anushka Sharma
 donon hi maamalon main dilachasp yah he ki kohli kuch bhi karen, unhen jaij tehraaya gaya tha
 Of course, if they say or do something, it becomes news
 isliye jab yah pataa chalaa ki ve anoushka se shaadi kar sakate hai, to yah saare media ke liye braking news thi
 And it was only in a few days that Kohli evicted Shahrukh Khan as India's most precious brand
 bahut kuch daanv par laga he or kohli apane kaarobaar kii oonch-neech jaanate hai
 There is a lot to be written about Kohli
 paanch saal baad kya ve bharat ke sabase mahaan ballebaaj or sabase shandaar captain honge yaa phir unka patan aise nirankush ke rup main hoga jisane kiwandati jaise kumble ke saath bura bartaav kiya? kya unke liye yah myne rakhata he ki unhen ham aakhir kis rup main dekhte hai? ek vyakti ke rup main kohli ko kya vaaki isaki parvaah he? meraa akalan he ki ve asaliyat main aise nahin hai
 They seem to have lived the time perfectly, in their gyms, in their training, in their weddings, and on a pitch of 22 yards
 meraa akalan he ki ve karodon rupye ke prachaar sambandhi karaaron ko yun hi nahin jane denge
 They realize their responsibilities, they fully concentrate when batting or practicing
 maano koi maanviya robot hon
 Ian Batham, the all-rounder of the past, says, "the good thing about Virat is that he plays to win

 centre sarkaar ne jawaab main kaha he ki iskar vibhaag ne chhapemari main kuch bhi galat nahin kiya
 It is the decision of the department to use or not use paramilitary force in the raids
 sarkaar kii isamen koi bhoomika nahin
 Actually, Karnataka's Congress minister DK Shivkumar Kerijort had raided the Income Tax recently
 iskar vibhaag ne dilli or karnataka sthit 39 thikaanon par chaape maare the, jisamen kareeb 9
 Cash of Rs 5 crore was recovered
 sivakumar ke jis eagleton resort par chapa padaa tha, usamen gujarat congress ke vidhayak tehre hue the
 They were kept in Bangalore to protect the party mlas from horse trading in view of the Rajya Sabha elections
 yahi vajah he ki congress ne iskar vibhaag kii is chhapemari ko centre sarkaar dwaara kii jane vaali kaarywai bataai thi
 Not only this, the Congress legislators staying in the resort from Election Commission to its complaint have been intimidated and threatened by the paramilitary forces
 chunaav ayog ne congress ke aaropon par centre sarkaar ke vitt sachiv se tathyaparak report dene ko kaha gaya tha
 On this, the Finance Ministry of the Central Government has defended the Income Tax Department on the issue of raids in Karnataka
 sarkaar ne apane jawaab main iskar vibhaag dwaara ardh sainik bal ke upyog ko sahi tehraaya
 According to sources, according to the central government, it is not uncommon for the Income Tax Department to use the military forces during a raid
 duusari ore vahiin gujarat sarkaar ne bhi chunaav ayog ko jawaab dete hue kaha kii kanoon vyavastha banaae rakhana rajya kii jimmedaari he
 She is meeting him
