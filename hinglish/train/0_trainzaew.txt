 ayodhya ram janmabhumi maamle main SC kii samvidhan peeth main sunwaayee kaa 23waan dinjilani kaa daawa- 1934 se 1949 ke bich babari masjid main niyamit namaaj hui22-23 disambar 1949 kii raat ramalala kii murti ko masjid ke andar rakhi gai-daavaayodhya ram janmabhumi maamle main supreme court kii samvidhan peeth main sunwaayee lagaataar jari he
 On behalf of the Muslim side, another lawyer Zafaryab Jilani on Friday tried to prove through documents that between 1934 and 1949 there were regular prayers in the Babri Masjid
 to vahiin ek anya muslim paksh kii taraf se varisht vakil rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki hindu baahar ke ahaate main puja karte the, lekin 22-23 disambar 1949 kii raat ramalala kii murti ko avaidh tareeke se masjid ke andar shift kar diya gaya
 During the 23rd day hearing in the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in the Ram Janmabhoomi case, second lawyer Zafaryab Jilani started the debate on behalf of the Muslim side, saying that in 1885 when Nirmohi Akhara filed a petition in the court, he in his petition The disputed land was said to be a mosque on the western border
 yah hissaa ab vivaadit jameen kaa bhitari angan ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The 'nirmohi Akhara', a regular namaz between 1934 and 1949, also referred to the mosque in his 1942 trial in which he accepted the mosque as a three-dome structure
 varisht vakil jafarayab jilani in dastavejon ke jariye yah sabit karne kii koshish kar rahe hai ki 1934 se 1949 ke bich bhi babari masjid main niyamit namaaj hoti thi
 However, before the bench, advocate Jilani said that there were not many people coming for the daily prayers, but there was a crowd in the prayers
 kai logon ke bayaan nichali adaalaton main darj hai jo faijabad se namaaj adaa karne yahaan janmasthan masjid main aate the
 In 1949, people who prayed Namaz, Zafaryab Jilani argued that from the documents presented by the Nirmohi Akhara, it is clear that there was a mosque but even then how can we say that Namaz was not read there
 unhone mohammad hashim ke bayaan kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki hashim ne apane bayaan main kaha tha ki unhone 22 disambar 1949 ko babari masjid main namaaj padhi thi
 Zafaryab Jilani quoted Haji Mehboob's statement that on 22 November 1949 he had offered namaz at Babri Masjid
 jilani ne ek gavaah ke bare main bataate hue kaha ki 1954 main babari masjid main namaaj padhane kii koshish karne par us vyakti ko jail ho gai thi
 Zafaryab Jilani also referred to the statement of Hafiz, who taught Taraweeh prayers in the Babri Masjid in 1945–46
 unhone ek gavaah ke bayaan kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki usne 1939 main magarib kii namaaj babari masjid main adaa kii thi
 Zafaryab Jilani, appearing for the Muslim side, is trying to prove on the statement of the witnesses of the Muslim side that even after 1934 the Namaz was read at the disputed site
 isse pehle hindu paksh kii taraf se supreme court main jirah ke dauraan yah daleel di gai thi ki 1934 ke baad vivaadit sthal par namaaj nahin padhi gai thi
 On behalf of the 'nirmohi Akhara Shebiyat' Muslim side, senior advocate Rajeev Dhawan started his arguments for another one of the Muslim parties
 dhawan ne kaha ki nirmohi akhaada ne sirf prabhaar or prabandhan ke liye, andar ke ahaate ke adhikaar ke liye yachika daakhil kii he
 He further said that at first Hindus worshiped in the outer courtyard, but on the night of 22-23 December 1949, the idol of Ramlala was illegally shifted inside the mosque
 dhawan ne kaha ki nirmohi akhaade kaa kahana he vah shabiyat yani sevaayat he
 At present, the arena is deprived of management rights, but if a new temple is built, then the Nirmohi Akhara will remain its Shebiyot
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki 1885 main mahant raghubar das ke mukademe ko pehle nirmohi akhaade ne nakaar diya tha, lekin baad main nirmohi akhaada kaa mahant maan gaya tha
 Similarly Nirmohi Arena earlier rejected the term birthplace but later considered it in the judicial entry
 somvaar ko bhi jari rahegi sunwaayeerajiv dhawan ne sthaan ko juristic person maanane kii daleel par bhi sawaal uthaaya
 He argues that the Hindu side has argued that here rivers, mountains, wells are prayed for, i argue that this is a Vedic practice
 jahaan tak vedon kaa sawaal he ki ve ise puujate hai lekin is rup main nahin
 You pray to the Sun, but do not call it your jurisdiction
 unhone kaha ki swayambhu kaa concept yah hota he ki ishwar khud ko parilakshith karata he, jaise koi parvat yaa maansarovar, isse ye sabit nahin hota ki is tarah ke swayambhu ishwar swaroopon kaa juristic personality hi ho

 kencinghton ovel par pehla din gendbaajon ke naam rahaa tathaa kul 13 wicket gire
 India had a poor start and lost the top four wickets within 38 runs
 iske baad lakshmana ne suresh raina (53) ke saath paanchaven wicket ke liye 117 ran kii saajhedaari kii
 India lost 201 runs after losing the last six wickets for 46 runs

 ishanth sharma, praveen kumaar or abhimanyu mithun teenon ne ek-ek wicket lekar pehle din bharat kaa palada kuch baari rakhaa
 Ishant took Adrian Barath (3) in the fourth over of the innings with a short pitch ball
 ishanth kii gend barath ke balle ke bich ke hisse se lagakar gali main khadey viraat kohli ke paas pahunchi jinhone kaich kaa abhyaas kiya
 In the next over, the ball carrying Praveen Kumar's swing took the outside edge of Lendl Simmons (2) to the wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni's gloves
 ab mithun kii baari thi jinhone din ke antim over main derren braavo (9) ko dhoni ke haathon kaich karaayaa
 Bravo, however, was not happy with the decision

 This season saw Bishu and Edwards' bowling feat
 bishu ne lakshmana or raina ke alaava praveen (12) ko out kiya jabaki edwards ne dhoni (2), harbhajan (5), or mithun (shunya) ko pavilion bheja
 The second season was entirely in the name of Indians, in which Laxman's artistic stroke and Raina's adventure shot were also seen
 lekin chaay ke vishram ke baad in donon kii saajhedaari lambii nahin chali
 In the third over of the third season, Bishu got the much awaited success to West Indies by dismissing Raina
 vaise yadi is shrinkhalaa main ampiron kii nirnay samiksha pranali (udiares) hoti to raina pavilion nahin lautate
 Bishu's ball suddenly bounced towards the leg stump, which hit Raina's Thai pad and went to the short leg fielder
 westeindies kii apil main bhi zyada dam nahin tha lekin ampire asad rouf kii ungali uth gayi
 Raina was not happy with the decision
 vah is ummid main boundry par bhi khadey rahe ki kya pataa ampire apana faisle main sudhaar kar den
 He played 105 balls in his innings and hit seven fours
 iske baad bhartiya pari simtane main der nahin lagi

 The Supreme Court has declared the Aadhaar card constitutional with certain conditions
 aaie jaanate hai ki Aadhaar jaisaa card banane kaa vichaar sabase pehle kab or kyon aayaa
 
 
 Aadhaar is actually the name of a project under which all citizens and residents (living more than 180 days) are given a unique identity based on their biometric details
 yah pahchaan sarkaar niyantrit ek bhandar unic identification athurity of india (UIDAI) main surakshit rakhi jaati he
 It is the largest biometric project in the world

 People associated with the Indian power establishment were shocked by the sudden infiltration of Pakistani army into the Indian border
 is ghuspaith kii vajah se hi 1999 kaa kargil yuddh hua tha
 After this, the then Atal Bihari Vajpayee government constituted a committee to review the Kargil war

 jioem ne kaha ki avaidh ghuspaith kii samasya gambhir ho gai he or bharat main rahane vaale sabhi nagarikon or gaiyr nagarikon ke liye registration anivaary hona chahie
 The gom said that all citizens should be given a Multi Purpose National Identity Card (MNIC) and non-citizens should be issued a different color i card

 In 2007, for the first time MNI cards were issued
 lekin is project kaa naam badalakar neshnal athurity for unic aaidentity (NAUID) kar diya gaya
 In 2011, more than 160 people were killed in the 26 September Mumbai attack by Pakistani terrorists
 iske baad NAUID par kaam tej kar diya gaya
 NAUID was finally established in January 2009 through a notification from the then Planning Commission
 baad main iskaa naam badalakar UIDAI kar diya gaya or iske tahat die jane vaale card kaa naam Aadhaar card kar diya gaya
 Aadhaar was challenged but Aadhaar was challenged in the Karnataka High Court on the ground that it violates the basic rights of citizens

 In 2013, the Supreme Court made all state governments and the central government defendants in the case
 supreme court ne aadhaar par ai sabhi yachikaaon ko ek saath jod diya

 rajya sabha se congress saansad piel puniya kaa maananaa he ki boforce to farji mudda banaaya gaya tha, jo court of lau main khaarij ho gaya
 The real scam is Rafael, in which everything is clear like glass, how the price was increased and how an industrialist was given the benefit
 rafel deal 2019 chunaavon me mukhya mudda hoga
 It is worth mentioning that first Rahul Gandhi raised this issue continuously in his rallies, Congress kept up the issue by holding press conferences again and again
 phir rahul ne modi sarkaar ke khilaaf aae avishvaas prastaav par bolte hue piem kii maujuudagi main rafel mudde ko sadan ke patal par puri takat ke saath uthaaya
 Two days later, former Defense Minister AK Antony, after a large press conference, further extended Rahul's allegations
 iske baad party kii ek baithak main khud rahul ne apane netaaon se kaha ki, rajyon main jin muddon par aap media se mukhaatib hote hai, hote rahen
 But at the same time, on the big national issue like Rafael, also tell the media in simple terms
 iske baad congress media vibhaag or soshal media vibhaag ne is mudde ko jan jan tak pahunchane ke liye apni ranneeti banaai he
 In this, a short clip of the statement containing the allegations against Rafaelul was made viral
 aage bhi alag alag bhashaaon main iske chote-chote pamfalet baantkar isko kone kone main pahunchane kii taiyaari he
 In this entire exercise special care is being taken that easy language should be attractive and attractive in public
 ranneeti ke tahat, rahul ke aaropon ke teen binduon ko khaas taur hai lite kiya janaa he:1
 Why was the Modi government buying a fighter aircraft worth Rs 520 crore during the UPA government for Rs 1670 crore? upie ne rakh-rakhaav or bhavishya main utpaadan kaa jimmaa sarkari company hindustan aronutics limited ko diya, usko modi sarkaar ne ek privet company ko diya, jiske paas ladaaku kya vimaan banane kaa koi anubhav nahin he
 3
 desh kii suraksha se jude raksha saude main ghotaalaa hua
 The Congress probably remembers that during Bofors, the figure of 64 crores brokerage was repeatedly thrown by the opposition, which went on everyone's tongue
 kuch isi tarj par congress bhi aankadon ko saral or sidhe tareeke se chunavi mudda banaayegi
 For this, Rahul, the rest of the leaders and the Congress will continue to raise the issue in a new way, with the opposition ahead
 isi ranneeti ke tahat congress loksabhaa main is mudde par piem or raksha mantri par galatabayani kaa aarope lagaakar visheshadhikaar hanan prastaav laane kii taiyaari main hai
 At the same time, the Aam Aadmi Party, which was once the anti-upa government, is also standing with the Congress in this campaign, the party's Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is also surrounding PM Modi in the Rajya Sabha on this issue
 kul milakar 1989 main to vipaksh ne congress ke khilaaf ek raksha saude ko hathiyaar banaakar use siyaasi farsh par laa diya tha, thik vaise hi ab congress vipaksh ke saath milakar ek raksha saude ke jariye siyasat ke itihaas ko doharaana chaahati he
 The BJP may be waiting for its election manifesto, but it has been severely criticized by other parties
 nai dilli main somvaar ko bijepi ne lagbhag sabhi varisht netaaon kii maujuudagi main apana ghoshnaa jari kiya
 The return of the Ram temple in this important document has provoked the Congress and CPM
 haalanki congress netaa digvijay singh ne yah jarur kaha ki bijepi jaisi party ne madrason kii madad kii baat kahi he to yah loktantr ke liye shubh sanket he
 Digvijay happy with the promise of Madrasas' help! Digvijay took a dig at the BJP for the Ram temple issue
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe maaloom tha, in logon main ram ke prati nishtha nahin
 Only propagated and made political use of Ram's name
 ' digvijay ne haal hi main aae cobra post ke sting kaa zikr karte hue kaha, 'aap cobra post kaa sting dekhenge, to usamen VHP netaa kah rahe hai ki jab tak kuch hindu nahin marenge, tab tak is andolan main jaan nahin aegi
 In 2004, he said that a huge temple would be built, then stopped talking
 par mujhe khushi he ki bijepi jaisi party bhi madrason ko madad kii baat kar rahi he, to yah desh ke liye shubh sanket he
 BJP said goodbye to Atal: JDU, once a BJP ally, has also condemned the inclusion of issues of 'hindutva hardline' in the manifesto
 jediu mahasachiv kasee tyaagi ne kaha, 'aaj kaa din atal yug kii samaapti kaa din he
 16 years ago, he promised the country that the controversial issues, such as the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute, Section 370, the Uniform Civil Code, would not place them in the manifesto
 lekin bijepi ne aaj dobaaraa in muddon ko jod atal ko alavida kah diya
 There is no mention of special status to Bihar in this manifesto
 'unka asli cheharaa ujagar: cpivamapamwi party sipiai ke netaa gurudas dasgupta ne kaha ki is ghoshnaa patr main ram mandir kaa mudda jodakar bijepi ne apane asli rang dikhaa die hai
 He said, 'he wants to strengthen his Hindu vote
 magar yahi unka sampradayik cheharaa he
 This is a warning to those who think that Narendra Modi is a strong leader and can run the country
 'congress netaa raashid alvi ne kaha ki bijepi samvidhan ke mutabik mandir kii baat kar rahi he, to isse kise inkaar he
 Then what are they quarreling with for 20 years
 bijepi ko bataanaa chahie ki kya samvidhan masjid todakar mandir banane kii ijaajat detaa he?'mandir banaaenge, taarikh nahin bataaenge'mayawati kii party ne bhi ram mandir ko chunavi mudda banane kaa virodh kiya he
 Party leader Sudhindra Bhadauriya while taunting BJP said, 'it is also saying that we will build Ram temple, but after talking to people
 jo puraane log hai, vah jaanate hai, vahi naaraa he ki ramalala ham aaenge, mandir vahiin banaaenge
 But will not tell the date
 inkaa asli mukhauta amit shah or vasundhara raaje hai
 ' bihar ke up-mukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ke gards par mediakarmiyon se marpet kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 It is being told that Tejashwi's security and supporters fiercely beat up the media persons for asking questions
 ghatana us vakt kii he jab tejasvi yadav cabinet kii baithak se baahar nikal rahe the
 In secretariat, Tejashwi Yadav spoke to the media
 bijepi ke istife kii maang ko lekar mediakarmi lagaataar tejasvi yadav se sawaal kar rahe the
 Meanwhile, Tejashwi Yadav's security guards and supporters erupted and started scrambling with media persons
 is marpet se pehle hitejasvi ne media par apana gussa jaahir kar diyatha
 He had said that a section of the media is Modi-oriented and a goon
 is bavaal se pehle railway tender ghotaale main ghire bihar ke dipti siem tejasvi yadav pehali baar apane bachaav main or virodhiyon par bhi jamkar bole
 Tejashwi Yadav walked out after the cabinet meeting
 cabinet se pehle bhi media ne unhe sawaalon ke saath gheraa tha, lekin tab wo chupchaap andar chale gaye
 But after the meeting was over, when the questions about his resignation started again, Tejashwi lashed out and his supporters were also infuriated

 desh main khastahal sarkari banking dhaanche ko durust karne ke liye centre sarkaar 4 sarkari bainkon ke marjar plan par kaam kar rahi he
 With this decision, where the second largest state-owned bank will be ready after the State Bank of India, the distressed banks, which have become a burden for the central government, will be able to stand on their feet after this merger
 centre sarkaar kii taiyaari ke mutabik ek or bada sarkari bank banane kii kavayad main idibiai, central bank, bank of baroda or oriental bank of commers kaa marjar kiya jayega

 However, before this scheme works, the central government has now prepared a road map of 4-5 big banks in the country

 The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has taken a major step in the terror attack on the Pathankot airbase
 enie kii vishesh adaalat ne shuukravaar ko chaar pakistani aatankiyon ke khilaaf giraftaar kaa warrant jari kar diya he, jinamein masood ajahar or uske bhai rauf kaa naam bhi shaamil he
 The Mohali-based NIA special court on Friday issued an arrest warrant against four Pakistani handlers, Masood Azhar, his brothers Rauf, Kasif Jan and Shahid Latif, accused of the attack
 is aadesh ke saath hi ab ye sabhi chaar aatanki aadhikarik rup se maamle main wanted kii shrenee main aa gaye hai
 The PAK team came to investigate that this step has also been taken by the NIA at a time when the Pakistani JIT has changed his face as soon as he returns to his country after checking from Pathankot
 jeiti ne kaha he ki use pathankot main aise koi saboot nahin mili jo yah sabit kar saken ki hamale main pakistani sarajameen kaa istemaal hua
 Whereas sources are quoted saying that India has such strong evidence as forensic and electronic evidence, which Pakistan cannot deny
 JIT ko saunp chuke hai naam or patasarkari sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki bharat ne pathankot airbase par hamalaa karne vaale pakistani aatankiyon ke saath hi unke aakaaon kii pahchaan bhi kar lee he
 India is said to have handed over complete electronic evidence of the conversation of Maulana Masood Azhar, his brother Rauf and terrorist handler Kasif Jan to the JIT
 yahi nahin, bharat ne jab JIT ko 4 aatankiyon ke naam or unke pate saunpe to JIT ne unamem se na sirfatankiyonki pushti kii, balki unke pakistan sarajameen se aane kii baat bhi sweekaar kii
 So what has scared Pakistan? The Pakistani JIT may be saying that the evidence is weak, but the truth is that the evidence submitted by the NIA is strong and sound
 bharat ne pakistani JIT ko 17 pej kaa ek rodmap bhi diya he, jisamen bataaya gaya he ki hamalaa maamle kii jaanch kaise badhegi
 Pakistan has also taken that road map from India
 un 17 pannon ke alaava NIA ne paak JIT ko detail LR bhi diya he
 It is also being understood that Pakistan was frightened by the proposal of the Indian investigative team to leave and perhaps that is why it changed its stand

 olympic main cricket ko shaamil karne kii maang pehle bhi hoti rahi he, lekin isko kabhi gambhirtha se nahin liya gaya
 This time, when the ICC is making efforts for it itself, the world's richest board remains a barrier to BCCI cricket's participation in the Olympics
 apane rutabe ko lekar BCCI kaa adiyal ravaiyaolympic main cricket ko shaamil karne ke liye sabakuch thik chal rahaa he, intjaar he to bas bharat kii manjuuri kaa
 The ICC and IOC want to include T20 cricket in the Olympics
 bisisiai iske liye sahamat nahin he
 The main reason for BCCI not participating in the Olympics is its autonomy
 bisisiai nahin chaahati ki uski swytta par koi khatra paidaa ho
 BCCI does not want to distribute its earnings from IOA Another reason for opposition from BCCI is about revenue, if BCCI joins IOA, it will have to distribute its revenue, which BCCI does not want at all
 isisi, bisisiai ko raji karne ke liye har sambhav prayaas kar rahi he

 In such a situation, it is also difficult for the ICC to take a step without India
 iosi pehle hi saaf kar chukaa he ki jab tak badi tiimon or uske bade khiladiyon ke khilne aashwaasan nahin miltaa iosi, isisi ke aise kisi prastaav par vichaar nahin karegaa
 The ICC has till September the deadline of the ICIC till September, within which it has to convey its decision to the IOC, so that further processing can be completed
 supreme court dwaara gathit prashaskon kii samiti ne bisisiai ke siio rahul johari se cricket ko olympic main shaamil karne sambandhit report maangi he
 Cricket can be included in the 2024 Olympics if the BCCI agrees
 olympic main cricket kaa aayojan 1990 paris olympic main kiya gaya tha
 The 2024 Olympics in Paris may once again become the return venue of cricket in the Olympics

 Rekha has recommended this amount to be given from his mp-fund
 mathura ke kishori raman balika inter college or nauhajhil ilaake kekasturba gandhi balika inter colejko yah raashi milegi

 dilli menam aadmi partika pehla ek maheenaa puraa ho chukaa he lekincagerivalsarkaar ne is dauraan ek bhi bade project ko manjuuri nahin di he
 In fact, to approve any project with a budget of more than 10 crores, a meeting of the Expenditure and Finance Committee, ie EFC, is chaired by the Finance Minister
 agar kisi project kii laagat 50 karod se adhik kii hoti he to use mukhyamantri kii adhyakshata vaali iefasi main laana jaruri hota he
 But no meeting of this committee was held in the first one month of Kejriwal government, so no plan costing more than 10 crores was passed
 gauratlab he ki guuruuvaar ko upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne nae mukhya sachiv ke ke sharma or dilli sarkaar ke sabhi vibhaagon ke mukhiya kii meeting bulaai he

 iske alaava dilli main pichley do saal se nae 1500 bason kaa tender bhi atka padaa he
 It also needs to be approved as soon as possible

 prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav PAC se nikaale gayeam aadmi party main aapasi dwandv chal rahaa he, is antar kalah kaa khulaasa hua
 This proved to be a major setback for party seekers when its founding members Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav were expelled from the National Executive (PAC), accusing them of being involved in anti-party activities during the assembly elections
 phir kya tha, AAP netaaon ne pehali baar khulkar bhadaas nikaali
 Despite the ban, Mayank Gandhi made the details of the party's national executive public through his blog and targeted Ashish Khaitan and some other leaders
 isamen unhone yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan ko PAC se baahar karne ke liye arvind kejariwal ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 After this, another blog of his came and he wrote that after writing the first blog, he is being humiliated
 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki unhen bibiem (blueberi massenger) group se bhi baahar kar diya gaya
 Through this blog, he feared that he would be humiliated and expelled from the party
 prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav kii ore se bhi ek lanbaa-chaudaa khat jari kiya gaya jisamen donon ne apane upar lage kai aaropon par hairaan karne vaali baaten bataai

 ' tripura main 25 saal se sattarudh sipiai(em) sarkaar ko vidhansabha chunaavon main karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 While the CPI (M) continued to form the government in the state after the last 5 elections, this time the ruling BJP at the Center has cleared its way to a two-thirds majority by beating it
 chunaavon main is nattejey ke baad saaf he ki bijepi kii ranneeti sattarudh left se adhik prabhavi sabit hui he or rajya kii janata ne mukhyamantri maanik sarkaar kii lokapriyata ko nakaarte hue bijepi ke badlaav ke naare ko zyada pasand kiya
 Know the bjp's strategy that led to this unexpected victory
 
 
 42 hajaar panna pramukhaleft party ke is garh ko dhwast karne ke liye bijepi ne rajya main prati 60 voter ek panna pramukh tainaat karne kii ranneeti bichaai thi
 It is noteworthy that after the success of the strategy of Panna chiefs in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections in 2017, the party also appointed a total of 42 thousand Panna chiefs in Tripura
 in panna pramukhon ko unke hisse main aae 60 votaron ko saadhane kii jimmedaari di gai thi
 The Panna chiefs had to keep direct contact with the voters as well as publicize the policies of the Central Government and ensure that all the voters reached the polling booth on the day of voting

 During this period, the top leaders of the party and other SAIL functionaries were given responsibility to publicize the achievements and achievements of the central government in the three states
 devdhar saadhe teen saal se hantripura main is apratyaashit jeet ke liye aresas se training le chuke bijepi netaa sunil devdhar kii ahm bhoomika rahi
 Deodhar, who hails from Mumbai, started his job of turning around for the party in Tripura about 2 years ago
 devdhar ko chunaavon se pehle bijepi ne tripura kaa incharge niyukt kiya tha
 Significantly, in the 2014 general elections, Deodhar played an important role as the campaign manager of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 tripura kaa incharge niyukt hone ke baad devdhar ne rajya main prachaar ke liye 'modi dhyut yojana' chalaate hue bijepi kaaryakartaaon dwaara modi sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon ko kshetreey bhashaa main pahunchane kaa kaam kiya

 rajya main chunaav kaa bigul bajane se pehle hi janvari 2018 se hemanta sharma ne tripura main deraa daalkar bijepi kii jeet ko tay karne kaa kaam kiya
 It is worth noting that earlier Hemanta Sharma also played a very important role in the formation of BJP government in Assam, Arunachal and Manipur
 ram madhav kaa rahaa netritvtripura samet purvottar main teenon rajyon ke chunaav prachaar kii kaman ram madhav ne sanbhali thi

 khaastaur par tripura main ram madhav kii pahal par rajya kii maanik sarkaar kii satta ko vikaas virdohi qaraar dene kii ranneeti par kaam kiya gaya
 Apart from this, under the leadership of Ram Madhav, the party decided the victory of the BJP by sending the party among the tribal voters in the state
 pichley chaar saal main darjanon mantriyon ke daure huecader yukt left partiyon ke mukaable ke liye bijepi ne sirf sanghathanaatmak taur par party ko nahin khadaa kiya
 The BJP worked in the campaigning of the Prime Minister's two important rallies for the state elections, as well as dozens of central government ministers
 gauratlab he ki beete chaar saal ke kaarykaal ke dauraan bijepi ne rajya main lagaataar kendriya mantriyon ko bhejne kaa kaam kiya jisase samay aane par vah rajya kii maanik sarkaar ke mukaable party ko majboot vikalp ke taur par pesh kar saken
 In these visits of the Union Ministers, the schemes of the Central Government were strongly publicized and it was clearly argued before the people of the state that the Government of Manik has done only to keep the state away from development
 guwahati headquarter, assam se milapura saportatripura main bijepi kii is shandaar jeet ke kendra main assam rahaa
 Since forming the government in Assam last year, the BJP has consistently made Guwahati the center of its political activities in the Northeast to make inroads in other states of the Northeast
 assam ke vitt mantri hemanta vishwa sharma ko jeet kaa daaromadar saunpane ke saath-saath tripura incharge sunil devdhar ko bhi guwahati main camp karne ke liye kaha gaya
 However, Guwahati has also been kept in the center for elections to Nagaland and Meghalaya, the other two northeastern states
 sushamaa swaraj ne lalit modi ko portugal kaa vija dilaane main madad kii

 sushamaa ne iske liye bitrish saansad kith vaaj or vahaan ke ucchayukta se baatcheet kii or kaha ki lalit modi ko travel vija dene main bharat sarkaar ko koi aapatti nahin he
 There has been a ruckus on the fact that Lalit Modi, who left India in 2010, is accused of cheating around Rs 500 crore

 Lalit Modi is not coming to India from England to escape the investigation

 However, the real idea of IPL was that of Madhav Rao Scindia
 magar jab lalit modi ke rishte bhartiya cricket board se kharaab hue, to sabhi ne lalit modi se ankhe mode lee
 The sayers also say that Lalit Modi is also behind the lawsuit against Srinivasan in the Supreme Court and the prominent lawyers appearing in it

 The comments is prakaran ne bijepi ke andruni kalah kii kalai bhi khol di he
 Now look at Rajnath Singh and Sushma's first BJP president Amit Shah
 ek vakt main pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi gujarat cricket sangh ke adhyaksh rah chuke hai or ab amit shah iske adhyaksh he
 Shah is aware that it will not only be an attack on Sushma, but will also be the prime minister on target, as the Prime Minister's Office runs a lot in the Ministry of External Affairs
 yahaan ahm yah nahin he ki is vivaad ke peeche koun he
 The important thing is how right it is to help a fugitive on humanitarian grounds

 This is where the BCCI comes in this picture
 cricket board main netaaon kaa dakhal se sabhi waakif hai
 This is the reason that Kirti Azad openly came to Sushma's thought and tweeted that who is the snake of the sleeve in BJP! baat ishaaron ishaaron main ho rahi he
 Everyone knows who removed Kirti Azad from Delhi Cricket Association and till now their board in Bihar has not yet been recognized by the BCCI

 There is a fierce battle within the Congress to become a minister in Chhattisgarh
 varisht vidhayakon ko mantri pad dene se inkaar karne ke baad mukhyamantri bhupesh baghel kii musiibat badhati ja rahi he
 There has been pressure from more than half a dozen leaders within the party who have not been given ministerial berths
 lihaaja aise netaaon ko santusht karne ke liye mukhyamantri bhupesh baghel ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko khat likhakar mantriyon kii sankhya main ijapha karne kii maang kii he
 He has demanded a ministerial position of 20 percent instead of 15 percent of the total number of mlas citing geographical location and area of the state
 darasal, bhupesh baghel ke mantrimandal main varisht vidhayak va purv mantri satyanarayan sharma, amitesh shukla or dhanendra sahu ko jagah nahin mil pai he
 Arun Vora, MLA son of senior Congress leader Motilal Vora, is also unhappy over not getting a berth in the cabinet
 yahi haal anusuchit jati or janajati ke kai netaaon kaa bhi he
 State President of the party's Scheduled Tribe Front Amarjeet Bhagat was also busy in manipulating to become a minister, but he felt disappointed
 wo teesri baar vidhayak bane hai, jabaki aath baar ke vidhayak or purv mantri rampukar singh ko bhi maayusi haath lagi he
 He was so annoyed at not becoming a minister that he left the half-finished program from the oath taking place and returned
 bastar se adivasee netaa or purv mantri manoj mandavi bhi mantri nahin banane se asantusht hai
 In a letter sent to Prime Minister Modi, the Chief Minister of the state said that Article 164 (1-A) of the Constitution of India will not exceed 15 percent of the number of ministers including the Chief Minister in the Council of Ministers in a state
 is praavdhaan ke anusaar chhattisgarh main mukhyamantri sahit mantriyon kii sankhya 13 se adhik nahin ho sakati he
 He said that the area of chhattisgarh state is 1
 35 lakh varg kilometre se adhik he or yah raashtra ke kul bhubhag kaa 4
 4 percent
 iske saath hi chhattisgarh rajya kaa kshetrafal tamilnadu, telugana, bihar or pashchim bengal se bhi adhik he
 In Chhattisgarh, Scheduled Tribe population is 32 percent, Scheduled Caste 12 percent and Other Backward Class population is about 45 percent
 isko dhyaan main rakhte hue nae rajya main bhugolic kshetrafal ko dhyaan main rakhte hue shashan-prashasan ke sucharu sanchaalan ke liye mantri parishad ke sadasyon kii sankhya main vruddhi kiya janaa aavashyak he
 On the basis of all these facts, Chief Minister Baghel requested the Prime Minister to take appropriate initiative to amend the provision of Article 164 (1-A) of the Constitution to increase the number of members of the Council of Ministers in the state of Chhattisgarh from 15 percent to 20 percent

 asantusht netaaon ko manaane main juta congress alaakamanavhin,congress partike bheetar mache ghamaasan ko shant karne ke liye pradesh prabharee piel puniya jorshor se lage hue he
 He has instructed all the claimants of the ministers to show their stance of discipline in the party forum itself
 asantusht netaaon ko jald hi congress varking cameti kii baithak bulaae jane kaa bharosa dilaayaa gaya he
 The Congress has strategically left a vacancy in the cabinet
 party tamaam netaaon ko yah sandesh de rahi he ki loksabhaa main sarvshereshth pradarshan karne vaale vidhayak ko mantri banaaya jayega
 For this also this place has been kept vacant
 party ko is baat kaa andeshaa he ki mantri nahin banane se failaa asantosh kahin loksabhaa chunaav main us par baari na pad jaae
 Due to this, the party high command has to be hard pressed to convince the disgruntled leaders

 He called the Aidengue and Chikungunya-spreading Aedes a royal mosquito
 isaki dilachasp vajah bhi bataai
 According to Minister GK, dengue mosquito does not work in double shift, meaning it only bites during the day and not at night
 din main kaam karata he raat main nahinmantriji ke mutabik- din main bhi al subah yaa shaam ke vakt hi zyada active rahata he
 He also advised his party MLA Madan Lal, who was wearing a half sleeve shirt, to wear a full arm shirt from now on, as it reduces the risk of dengue mosquito bites
 emsidi par jamkar saadhaa nishaniske pehle aam aadmi party ke vidhayakon ne sadan main dengue aurchikngunia ke badhate maamalonko lekar emsidi kii jamkar khinchaai kii
 One by one, all legislators have alleged that the MCD is neither cleaning the roads properly nor preventing water from accumulating in the drains, allowing mosquitoes to thrive
 kaha- zyada painic failaayaa ja rahapatrakaron se baat karte hue bhi satyendra jain ne kaha kidengue ko lekar painic zyadafailaayaa ja rahaa he, jabaki hakeekat ye he ki dengue ke mariz ko aspataal main bhartee hone kii zarurat nahin he
 People watch the news of dengue on TV and are scared and reach the hospital
 jabaki dengue ke mariz ke liye paracitemaal hi ek dawaai he

 shahid film ke geet 'i vatan, i vatan, hamako teri kasam, teri rahon main jaan tak lutaa jaaenge' deshbhakti kaa pramukh gaanaa he
 This song is still heard anywhere in Mukesh's voice
 
 
 desh se pyaar karne waalon ke rongte khadey kar detaa he
 5
 film kabuliwala kaa geet 'i mere pyaare vatan, i mere bichade chaman, tujhpe dil qurbaan' aaj bhi deshbhakti kii alakh jagaata he
 Especially those who are away from the country and their home, they remember their home through this song
 6
 Praising our country, respecting the country is also patriotic
 film shahid-e-ajam kaa geet 'jahaan daal-daal par sone kii chidiya karti he baseraa, wo bharat desh he meraa' main jab manoj kumaar apane desh kii tarif karte najar aate hai to har hindustani kaa seenaa garv se chaudaa ho jaataa he

 This song also has tremendous lyrics written in praise of India

 In the film Upkar, when Manoj Kumar is seen singing 'my country's soil, gold sprouted, sprouted diamonds and pearls', it is believed in the heart that gold and silver and diamonds-pearls come out of the land of the country
 desh kii mitti or kisaanon kii mehnat ko salaam karata yah geet aaj bhi bachche-bachche kii jubaan par chadha rahata he

 If the country is independent, there is a need to maintain independence even after that
 dushman kii buree nazren desh par aksar lagi rahati hai
 In such a situation, the film leader's song 'we cannot erase our freedom, we can cut our heads but cannot bow our heads' shows our devotion to the country
 yah geet bataata he ki aaj bhi aise logon kii koi kami nahin he jo desh ke liye sar kataane ko bhi taiyaar hai

 The song 'aye Mere Pyare Vatan, Aye Mere Bichde Chaman, Tujhpe Dil Kurban' from the film Kabuliwala still evokes patriotism
 khaastaur par jo log desh or apane ghar se dur hai ve isi gane ke jariye apane ghar ko yaad karte hai
 6
 apane desh kii tarif, desh kaa sammaan karnaa bhi deshbhakti hi he
 In the film shaheed-e-azam's song 'where the gold bird does roost on the wall, it is Bharat Desh Hai Mera', when Manoj Kumar is seen praising his country, every Indian's chest becomes wide with pride
 
 7
 In the east-west film, the song emanating from the lips of Manoj Kumar is 'preet Jahan Ki Reet Sada, i sing the song there, i am a resident of India, i talk about India' and a wave of heart rises and Lightning flashes throughout the body
 is geet main bhi bharat kii tarif main jabardast bol likhe gaye hai

 This song, saluting the soil of the country and the hard work of the farmers, still prevails on the tongue of every child

 desh aaazaad hua to uske baad bhi aazaadee ko barkaraar rakhane kii jarurat hoti he

 On the last day of the first phase of campaigning in Jharkhand, Congress President Sonia Gandhi attacked the Modi government at the Center in Daltonganj fiercely, saying that Narendra Modi made false promises to the people in the greed of power, while the Congress always respected people Worked
 sonia ne bijepi ko nafrat failaane vaali party bataaya
 Sonia said, in the greed of power, the BJP made promises to the people, but did not fulfill the promises
 bijepi kii sarkaar main yahaan aparaadh badha
 Sonia said that BJP can go to any extent for the chair
 congress party adhyaksh ne kaha ki ek taraf congress party he, jisane sabhi virgon ke liye logon ke liye kaam kiya, vahiin, bijepi samaaj main sampradayik tanaav paidaa kar rahi he
 He appealed to the people to consider all aspects before casting their vote
 sonia gandhi ne kaha ki logon ke sammaan ke liye congress ne kaam kiya, lekin achche din ke lubhaavne vaade ke saath jo log satta main aae, unki naakamayaabi har kone se najar aa rahi he
 Sonia Gandhi said that the natural resources of this country should be in her hands for the development of the people and her party had taken the initiative to give this right to the tribals and the poor
 unhone kaha ki congress kii pahal par adivaasiyon, garibon, daliton, pichhadaa varg ke logon or alpsankhyakon ko bhoomi adhigrahan adhinium ke tahat adhikaar die gaye the, lekin centre kii bijepi sarkaar isamen sanshodhan karne kaa vichaar kar rahi he
 Sonia claimed that it is the efforts of the previous UPA government and its development plans that are helping the country to move towards becoming a developed country today
 jharkhand kii samasyaon ke liye bijepi par hamalaa bolte hue sonia ne kaha ki logon ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bataanaa chahie ki rajya main 14 saal main 11 saal bijepi satta main rahi he, lekin yahaan samasyaayein jas kii tas raheen
 He alleged that while the UPA government was at the Center, Jharkhand was given crores of rupees for the implementation of programs in areas such as electricity, roads, drinking water and health, but it was of no use in the bjp-ruled state
 sonia ne kaha ki aaj ve (bijepi) kuposhan kii baaten karte hai, lekin bijepi ke shashan vaale rajyon ke lakhon aise logon par ve dhyaan kyon nahin de rahe hai
 Jharkhand has 40 percent mineral wealth of the country, yet why this state is backward
 
 
 aaj bhi jharkhand main andhera he
 Bharatiya Janata Party's Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy is well known for his rhetoric against the Gandhi family
 lekin pichley kuch dinon se unhone apni sarkaar ke khilaaf hi morcha khol diya he
 Even if the BJP does not answer their questions, an uncomfortable situation arises for the party
 ek ke baad ek twit ke jariye swami modi sarkaar par hamale kar rahe hai
 Now it is not clear why Swamy has taken such a stand against the party itself
 The issue of change of name of Ahmedabad is about the big city of Ahmedabad in Ahmedabad
 swami kaa kahana he ki jab centre main manmohan kii sarkaar kii thi, to gujarat ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri narendra modi the or unhone upie sarkaar ne ahmedabad kaa naam badalakar'karnavati'karne kii maang kii thi
 But his demands were not fulfilled at that time
 ab swami ne isi mudde ko lekar twit kiya he, unhone twit main likhaa, 'abhi to centre modi sarkaar he or wo ahmedabad kaa naam badalakar karnavati rakh sakati he
 Because Narendra Modi wanted to change the name of Ahmedabad during the UPA government '
 i urge PM to restore original name Karnavati for Ahmedabad
 As CM he had sent the proposal to PM MMS
 Now Namo is PM so he must finalise it— Subramanian Swamy (@swamy39)december 26, 2017kot-pant pahananaa choden modi ke mantridusraa twit main swami kaa gussa western paridhaan ko lekar bijepi par utraa
 Owner believes Western clothes are imposed by foreigners
 saath hi unka kahana he ki western kapade bhartiya mausam ke anukool nahin hai
 Through the tweet, he advised BJP leaders to leave western clothes and wear clothes suited to Indian weather
 saath hi unhone likhaa ki bijepi ko ise party anushaasan ke taur par lagu karnaa chahie
 In fact, many ministers including PM Modi, Kiran Rijiju are seen wearing coat-pants in between
 Western dress is a foreign imposed slavishness
 BJP should make it of party discipline for ministers to wear Indian climate friendly clothes— Subramanian Swamy (@ Swamy39) December 26, 2017 unhone isi hafte notebandi par sawaal uthaakar bijepi ko baikfoot par laa diya
 The work which the opposition had done till now, has been working for Swami for the last few days
 ahmedabad main chartered acountint ke ek kaarykram main swami ne kaha ki sarkaar ne notebandi kaa arthvyavastha or GDP par vipareet asar nahin dikhaane ke liye kendriya sankhyikee sanghathan (CSO) ke adhikariyon par behatar aarthik aankade dene kaa dabaav banaaya tha
 Swamy termed the current GDP figures as fake
 swami ne kaha, 'jidipi ke timahi aankadon par na jaaen
 They are all fake
 yah baat main aapako kah rahaa hum, kyonki mere pita ne siesao kii sthapana kii thi
 Recently i went there with Union Minister Sadanand Gowda (minister of Statistics)
 unhone siesao adhikariyon ko aadesh diya, kyonki notebandi par aankade dene kaa dabaav tha
 Therefore, he is releasing such GDP figures to show that demonetisation had no effect

 Swamy said that this decision is not in India's interest
 bharat kii credibility par bada sawaal khadaa ho gaya he
 Neither the US nor Israel will trust us
 unhone kaha ki hamane hameshaa philistin kaa samarthan kiya he, jo kashmir ke maamle main hameshaa hamaara virdohi rahaa he
 India has made a big mistake by not voting in favor of America and Israel
 India has made a huge mistake by not voting with US and Israel on US decision to choose West Jerusalem as location for its Embassy
 At present UN holds holy city of enemies as partitioned
 West Jerusalem is Israel's

 'TN BJP record: a national ruling party gets a quarter of nota’s vote
 Time for accountability — Subramanian Swamy (@ Swamy39) December 24, 2017: Subramanian Swamy raised questions against the BJP on the acquittal of all the accused in the 2G spectrum scam, besides the decision of the BJP on December 24, 2017
 unhone kaha ki aakhir aisa kya hua ki sibiai kii adaalat ko 2G ghotaale ke sabhi aropiyon ko bari karnaa padaa
 He said that the Modi government should immediately appeal to the High Court in the case
 bijepi netaa ne kaha ki maamle main sibiai ne koi dilchaspee nahin dikhaai
 He said, 'my party did not appear ready in the fight against corruption, due to which the accused in the case were acquitted by the court
 'swami ne apni hi sarkaar ko naseehat dete hue kaha ki is tarah kaa faisla mere liye koi jhatka nahin he, lekin itnaa jarur he ki agar hamane bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai ke taur tareeke nahin badale, to saal 2019 main bijepi ko tagada jhatka lagegaa
 People will question us about the matter in the year 2019
 While the internal sabotage is obvious to me, we shall win the 2G Spectrum on Appeal because the judgment is bogus

 Radhe Ma's English class will be surprising to know, but if you did not participate in Radhe Ma's class, you will regret it because Radhe Maa also teaches English on the spot
 aisa unhone upi ke sanbhal main kar ke dikhaa diya
 Journalists had come to ask questions, but Radhe Maa started her English class by aside the question
 mumbai se chalakar radhe maa gai to thi sanbhal ke kalki mahotsav main bhaag lene, lekin mahotsav main patrakaron se aamanaa-saamana hote hi radhe maa ne aisa drama kiya ki dekhne vaale bas dekhte hi rah gaye
 Radhe Ma's style was worth seeing
 kalki mahotsav main pahunchi radhe maa ne haath jod kar kaha jai mata di
 Then told a journalist that Saturn's condition is going on him, if you conface you will be happy
 or phir shuru ho gai radhe maa kii english class
 Rather than answering the questions of journalists, Radhe Maa started the English class
 or apane andaaj main tuki phooti angreji ke vaakya bolkar patrakaron se uskaa anuwaad poochne lagi
 When the journalists refused, Radhe Ma's mercury rose
 aam taur par khamosh rah kar vivaadon se bachane kii koshish karne vaali radhe maa is rose bilkul nae avatar main najar ai
 In such an avatar, where silence was coming out of the fire and embers from the eyes
 unka gussa dekhne laayak tha
 She looked completely different
 kalki mahotsav ke dauraan patrakaron ke sawaalon kaa jawaab dete-deteradhe maanek baar phir kuch itani baichaiyn hui ki pehle to gusse main laal-pili ho gayi or phir usee andaaz main rote-rote press conference bich main chhod kar bhaag khadi hui
 Just like a few days ago, during Aaj Tak's interview, she ran away from the weeping camera
 lekin radhe maa ko itnaa gussa aayaa kyun? kyon patrakaron ke sawaalon se itani baukhala gai wo? akhir kyon aaropon ke sawaalon par ulta patrakaron ko hi katghare main khadaa karne lagi wo? aap jab radhe maa kaa puraa press conference sunenge, to kabhi hairaan honge or kabhi hansate-hansate lot-pot ho jaaenge
 Actually, Radhe Maa has a long list of allegations
 inamen se kuch aarope jahaan vakt ke saath hawa ho gaye
 At the same time, there are some who are still following him
 phir chaahe wo wo aarope ashleelata failaane kaa ho, dahej ke liye kisi ladki ko sataane kaa, apane hi guru ke khilaaf saazish rachane kaa yaa phir aadhi raat kisi ko telephone kar dhamkaane kaa
 But before today, no one could say the least about Radhe Maa that Radhe Maa had never talked profanely to anyone or talked in a loud voice, but what had not happened till date, he became stable
 pichley hafte bhar main ek ke baad ek kai intervyuu dene ke baad camere kaa saamana karne or patrakaron ke sawaalon kaa jawaab dene ke maamle main radhe maa kaa kanfidence kuch itnaa hai hua ki sir se upar se guzar gaya
 Rather than answering questions directly or keeping quiet, Radhe Maa started to harass journalists
 kabhi kisi sawaal par kaha ki tum par shani kii dasha chal rahi he, to kabhi kaha ki tum kya doodh ko dhule ho
 But when the journalists objected to this idea of radhe Maa, then see how Radhe Maa turned
 kaha, main to maa hum kya maa ko apane bacchon par gussa karne kaa bhi haq nahin he
 But at the same time it also added that the mother does tantrums in front of the children and the children have to raise every tantrum
 vaise is press conference ke dauraan english kii do chaar panktiyaan or alfaaz bolkar radhe maa ne shaayad ye bhi sabit karne kii koshish kii ki padhe likhe hone ke maamle main koi bhi use unniis samajhane kii galati naa kare
 Just look at how Radhe Ma got uprooted on a question related to writing her studies
 goyaa jaise english bolnaa hi kisi ke padhe likhe yaa anpadh hone kaa paimaana ho
 By the way, another interesting thing among all of this was that Radhe Maa once again spoke her same old age jumla, which she spoke while facing the camera for the first time after accusing herself of dowry
 ji haa, vahiin ai em pyor and paayas vaala
 Rather, telling himself to be pure and emulsion, he also asked the journalist to tell him what to understand

 So dumbfounded on a question that you asked to see what happens to you in the next 15 days? That journalist turned out to be sensible, who blew this curse in the air, otherwise, if there was a devotee type item, perhaps his heart would have sat on this curse

 is kahawat ko sach austria kii parvatarohi angela itor ne sach kiya he, jisane lagaataar asafal rahane ke baad bhi apane lakshya ko hasil karne kii thaan lee
 Eater has become the first woman to climb the world's most inaccessible rocky hill
 angela se pehle sirf do purush ne us chattan par fatah hasil kii thi
 First left home then begging, now the first transgender of the country, the rock that Angela has climbed is on a hill called Planta de Siva, Spain, which is inclined towards the ground at a 45 degree angle
 spain main yah chattan vilanueva del rozaario sthit oonchi or ascharyajanak gupha ke paas maujuud hai
 The rock rocks of this cave made of limestone are absolutely smooth, which cannot be thought of climbing
 13 saal main paas kii 12veen, 8 bhashaaon main baat karti he jahnviis pahari par chadhane ke liye angela par paagalpan savaar tha ki unhone ek-do nahin balki puri saat baar koshishen kii
 But every time he had to face defeat
 lekin apni jid kii vajah se unhone is chattan par chadhaai kar jeet hasil kar lee
 This person shows the way of living to millions of blind
 
 
 koun hai angela itervah ek middle class parivaar se taalluk rakhti hai
 From childhood, his parents used to make him practice climbing mountains
 lekin jab vah 18 saal kii thi to unke doston ne unhen pahari se neeche gira diya tha
 After which she broke
 angela itor kai vaishvik chadhaai kii compitishan jeet chuki he
 She has also become a four-time world champion
 ham sab jaanate hai or aksar kehete hai ki aamir khan sabase zyaada or behatar tareeke se media kaa istemaal karte hai
 We also say and see that at the time of the release of the film, Shahrukh Khan comes in front of the media two or three times in a day, but be it Shahrukh or Aamir, they are all behind Kangana Ranaut
 maine pichley kuch saalon main jo dekha he us hisaab yaa us najariye se kangana se behatar to nahin kah saktaa magar ye kah saktaa hum ki kangana ranut se zyaada media kaa istemaal koi nahin karata yaa kangana se zyaada akhbaaron main koi nahin rahata
 Whether Kangana's film is on the verge of release or not, Kangana is not affected by it
 aap subah main mumbai kaa koi bhi akhbaar uthaaen usamen har rose kareeb kareeb sabhi akhbaaron main kangana se judi koi story yaa kangana kii koi na koi tasviir honi hi honi he
 Most of them are newspaper apps through which these stories reach on social networking sites and websites and then these morning news start running on news channels and music channels in the evening
 maine ek baar kangana se ye sawaal bhi poocha tha ki aapaki filmein aaen yaa naa aaen, aap har rose khabaron main rahati ho
 What do you need? Then Kangana had said, 'I do my work and our PR agency does its work and my agency is doing good work
 ' i think Kangana is very fond of being in the media headlines and perhaps that is why she gives a big amount of money to the industry's big PR agency for her publicity
 in piaar agency ke dwaara media net kharidvaaya jaataa he jisamen ped stories chhapavai jaati hai
 If Kangana has given money for the treatment of fever of her maid's child, then she also becomes a newspaper news
 kangana ke kaam kii koi bada star esemes karke taareef karata he, wo bhi akhbaar kii surkhi bana di jaati he vagairah vagairah
 And if an agency is a little relaxed, Kangana immediately changes the agency
 maine pichley 5 saalon main 3 agency badalte hue dekha he kangana ko
 The comments aam taur par sitare apni film ko promot karne ke liye media kaa istemaal karte hai magar kangana ke liye ye zaruri nahin
 Just by having them in the newspapers everyday means
 kai baar media dusre bade sitaron ke jhagadon, vivaadon yaa unki relationships kii khabaron ko dhundta he or or chatapata banaata he magar kangana ke maamle main media ko mehnat karne kii zarurat nahin padati kyonki wo khud hi aisi chatpati kahaniyaan media ke paas bhejti hai
 Overall, it would not be wrong to say that there is no more in the media and news these days than Kangana
 haalanki iskaa kuch khaas phayda bhi nahin he kangana ko kyonki jab film acchhee hoti he tab hit hoti he or jab film kamazor hoti he tab flop
 According to what i have seen in the last few years or from that point of view, i cannot say better than Kangana, but i can say that no one uses the media more than Kangana Ranaut or no one lives in newspapers more than Kangana
 kangana kii film release ke kagaar par khadi ho yaa na ho, kangana ko isse koi asar nahin padataa
 If you pick up any newspaper in Mumbai in the morning, almost every newspaper has to have a story related to Kangana or some picture of Kangana
 unamem se zyaadaatar akhbaaron ke eps hai jinke madhyam se soshal netwarking cites or websites par ye stories pahunchati hai or phir subah kii ye khabaren shaam hote hote news channels or mujeec channels par chalane lagati hai
 i once asked Kangana this question whether your films come or not, you live in the news every day
 isaki kya zarurat? tab kangana ne kaha tha, 'main apana kaam karti hum or hamaari piaar agency apana kaam karti he or meri agency acha kaam kar rahi he
 ' mujhe lagata he ki kangana ko media kii surkiyon main rahane kaa kuch zyaada hi shauq he or shaayad isliye wo industry kii badi piaar agency ko apane prachaar ke liye moti raqam detii hai
 Media net is purchased by these PR agency in which paid stories are printed
 kangana ne agar apni naukaraani ke bachche ke bukhaar ke ilaaj ke liye paise die hai to wo bhi akhbaar kii khabar banakar aati he
 a big star praises Kangana's work by SMS, that too is made the headlines of the newspaper, etc
 or agar koi agency thodi dhilaai baratati he to kangana foran agency badal detii hai
 i have seen Kangana changing 3 agency in the last 5 years
 tippaniyan Normally stars use media to promote their film but this is not necessary for Kangana
 bas unhen har rose akhbaaron main rahane se matlab he
 Many times the media looks for news of other big stars' quarrels, controversies or their relationship and makes it snappy but in Kangana's case the media does not have to work hard because they themselves send such snappy stories to the media
 kul milakar ye kahana galat nahin hoga ki media or khabaron main kangana se zyaada in dinon koi nahin rahata
 However, it does not have any special benefit because Kangana is a hit when the film is good and a flop when the film is weak
 kangana kii film release ke kagaar par khadi ho yaa na ho, kangana ko isse koi asar nahin padataa

 kai baar media dusre bade sitaron ke jhagadon, vivaadon yaa unki relationships kii khabaron ko dhundta he or or chatapata banaata he magar kangana ke maamle main media ko mehnat karne kii zarurat nahin padati kyonki wo khud hi aisi chatpati kahaniyaan media ke paas bhejti hai
 Overall, it would not be wrong to say that there is no more in the media and news these days than Kangana
 haalanki iskaa kuch khaas phayda bhi nahin he kangana ko kyonki jab film acchhee hoti he tab hit hoti he or jab film kamazor hoti he tab flop
 Normally stars use media to promote their film but this is not necessary for Kangana
 bas unhen har rose akhbaaron main rahane se matlab he
 Many times the media looks for news of other big stars' quarrels, controversies or their relationship and makes it snappy but in Kangana's case the media does not have to work hard because they themselves send such snappy stories to the media
 kul milakar ye kahana galat nahin hoga ki media or khabaron main kangana se zyaada in dinon koi nahin rahata
 However, it does not have any special benefit because Kangana is a hit when the film is good and a flop when the film is weak

 For India, the game of the fourth day was a volatile one
 bharat ne ek samay srilanka ke saat wicket 87 ran par ukhaad diye the lekin usne iske baad srilanka ko vaapasi kaa mauka dekar match main jeet darj karke shrinkhalaa 1-1 se baraabar karne kaa mahatvapurn mauka ganvaa diya
 Samaraweera (83) and especially Mendis (78) were responsible for this, adding 118 runs for the ninth wicket to take Sri Lanka's second innings score to 267 runs
 pi sara ovel kii tuutati pich par 257 ran ke mushkil lakshya kaa peechha karne ke liye utre bharat kii shuruyaat behad najuk rahi or chauthe din kaa khel samaapt hone tak vah teen wicket par 53 ran banaakar sangharsh kar rahaa he
 India still need 204 runs to win, but it will be very difficult to bat on this pitch on the fifth day
 abhi sachin tendulkar 11 or nitwachaman ishanth sharma do ran banaakar krij hai
 India were dominated by both Sri Lankan spinners on the fourth day
 mendis ne yadi balle se kamaal dikhaaya to suraj randiv ne gendbaaji main bharatiyon ko jatke diye
 Kumar Sangakkara handed the off-spinner a new ball
 He soon strengthened Sri Lanka's grip on the match by showing Virender Sehwag (00), Rahul Dravid (07) and Murali Vijay (27) as pavilions
 dravid is shrinkhalaa main phir se bharosemand sabit nahin ho paye or randiv kii teji se spin leti gend ko dephend karne ke prayaas main bold ho gayi
 In this way, Dravid scored only 95 runs in this three-match series
 randiv ne iske baad salaami ballebaaj vijay ko bhi pavilion bheja jinhone isse pehle kuch achche shaat lagaaye
 The off-spinner, who took a bounce at the leg and middle stump, came from the upper part of Vijay's bat and reached the backward short leg to Jayawardene who took a very low catch
 iske liye ampiron ko haalanki tisare ampire kii madad leni padi
 Earlier, India had a strong hold on the match
 sahvaag ne guuruuvaar ko srilanka kaa sheersh kram jhakzora tha to chauthe din pragyan ojha or amit mishra ne uske madhyakram ko dhwast kiya lekin samarvira or mendis ne bharat kii ummiido ko gaharaa aghat pahunchaaya
 Both of them set a new record for Sri Lanka from the ninth wicket partnership
 mendis bhartiya gendbaajon par kitna haaavee the uskaa andaja isi se lag saktaa he ki unhone srilankai pari main sarvaadhik 157 gend kheli, sarvaadhik das chauke or pari kaa ekmaatr chakka lagaaya
 Ojha then caught Sangakkara (28) in the hands of Suresh Raina and gave a shocking blow to Sri Lanka
 angelo maithyuj (05) bhi mishra kii nichi phultas par tendulkar ko midwicket par kaich thama baithe
 This leg-spinner also lbw to wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene on the next ball
 samarvira or lasith malinga (15) ne kuch der bhartiya gendbaajon ko safalataa se maharoom rakhaa
 Malinga hit Ojha for two fours but Sehwag lbw to a straight ball to end his innings
 samarvira ne puri jimmedaari se ballebaaji kii tathaa ek do ran lekar score aage badhaayaa jabaki kairam bal ke gendbaaj mendis ne ojha kii gend par srilankai pari kaa pehla chakka bhi jamaaya
 The partnership of these two was finally broken by Abhimanyu Mithun after taking the new ball in the third season but then India got the wicket not by the skill of the bowler but by the mistake of Samaraweera
 unhone mithun ke over ke bounsar par pul karne kii koshish kii lekin vah unke dastaanon ko chumkar mahendra singh dhoni ke paas chali gayi
 Samaraweera played 139 balls and hit six fours
 samarvira ke out hone ke baad mendis adhik aakraamak ho gayi or unhone iske turant baad ishanth par lagaataar teen chauke jamaaye
 Finally, in an attempt to hit the ball off Mishra, he catches Raina on the short extra cover

 Subhash and Arun Yadav have written in their letter that the farmers who produced good cotton last year produced more cotton this year
 niryaat jari rahane se kisaanon ko 4500 rupee prati quintal kii dar se kapaas kaa bhav mil rahaa tha, lekin paanch march se achaanak rui ke niryaat par pratibandh laga diya gaya
 Due to this, its prices have been reduced to Rs 3500 per quintal in the cotton market

 In such a situation, banning cotton exports is a blight on farmers

 The dead included a 65-year-old to a two-year-old girl
 haroonges taur par har maut ek hi tarah se ho rahi thi
 Before dying, the person would have restlessness, then chest pain and then suddenly he would die
 ghar waalon ko yahi lagata ki maut dil kaa daura padane se ho rahi he
 Therefore, after every death, the householder would forget that death and be patient
 magar isi ghar kaa ek betaa jo america main rah rahaa tha, use kuch shaq hota he
 So he returns to Kerala from America
 iske baad saamne aati he, ek aisi kahani jo haal ke vakt main naa kabhi suni gai naa sunai gai
 Story of a slow death
 lordes maathaa carch qabristaan, kudathai, kosikod, kerala4 aktubar 2019
 This had never happened before
 kahin nahin hua tha
 At least not in India
 kai cese ke silsile main kai baar kabren khodi gayi
 Piles were removed
 magar kisi kabristaan main ek saath chah-chah kabren khod kar chah-chah murdon ko baahar nikaala jaae, ye manzar isse pehle logon ne nahin dekha tha
 Who are the six dead who were buried at different times in the last 14 years
 ek saath 6 kabron kii khudaikeral police ke liye bhi ye pehla tajurba tha
 So the police came here with full preparation
 baqayada camere main har khudate kabr ko kaid kiya ja rahaa tha
 Those Chhab tombs are first identified
 jinhen khoda janaa tha
 After this, the excavation of all the six tombs begins one by one
 14 saal, 6 maut, ek hi parivarain kabron main se jo sabase puraani kabr thi
 She was 17 years old
 jabaki jo sabase taaji kabr thi
 She was also three years old
 yani in chah kabron main pehali laash 2002 main dafnai gai thi
 While the sixth and last corpse in 2016
 is bich chaar or laashen yahaan dafnai gai thim
 By the way, six of the six corpses belonged to the same family
 par chah mautein 14 saal ke faasale main hui thim
 The work of the police was completed in the first installment of the death by the Murdons
 laashen kabr se baahar aa gai thim
 What do corpses also call skeletons
 magar police ke liye ye bhi kaaphi he
 Because after examining these six skeletons, the police are going to find out the truth about their being dead
 or iske liye sabhi kankalon ko forensik jaanch ke liye bheja gaya
 Only after the report of that investigation was it to be revealed that this is the common death of six or serial killing? Before these secrets open, we try to tell you the truth of these corpses by telling them some truth
 wo bhi in gade murdon kii madad se
 On September 22, 2002, the first death, Annamma's status was the eldest in the Thomas family of Annamma Thomaskarel
 puraa parivaar anamma ke ishaare par hi chalata tha
 But then every day suddenly Annamma feels restless
 dekhte hi dekhte anamma dam tod detii hai
 The family thought that Anamma died of a heart attack
 lihaaza baad main anamma ko kudathai ko lordes maathaa carch ke isi pushtaini qabristaan main dafna diya gaya
 September 26, 2008, another death, exactly 6 years and 4 days after the death of Tom thomasanamma, another death occurs in the same house
 is baar maut ghar ke mukhiya or anamma ke pati tom kii hui thi
 Just like Anamma
 pehle bechaini or phir maut
 This time too, the housemates believed that Tom died of a heart attack
 lihaaza tom ko bhi isi kabristaan main dafna diya gaya
 Exactly equal to Anamma
 30 oktober 2011, teesri maut, roy thomsis din ghar main teesri maut hoti he
 Anamma and Tom's son, Roy Thomas, died this time
 roy kii maut bhi thik vaise hi hui
 Sudden restlessness and then stop at the law
 ghar waalon ne maan liya ki roy ko bhi dil kaa daur padaa he
 Even Noi's wife believed the same
 magar ek hi tarah se hui is teesri maut ne roy ke mamaa mathew ko man main shaq daal diya
 Matthew was adamant on conducting the post-mortem
 jehar se hui thi mautpostmortem hua or jab report ai to sab dang rah gaye
 Poison was found in 40-year-old Roy's body
 wo bhi synide
 After this, the matter should have become murder
 police ko tafteesh kerani chahie thi
 But despite the complaint, the police did not investigate the matter and the case of Roy's death was forgotten
 24 april 2014, chauthi maut, mathew manjaadiilroy kii maut ke teen saal baad hi achaanak usee haal main is baar us mathew kii bhi maut ho jaati he
 Which raised suspicion on Roy's death and due to which the post-mortem of Oy had to be done
 us postmortem report se hi khulaasa hua tha ki roy kii maut jehar kii vajah se hui thi
 May 3, 2014, the fifth death, the continuation of the death in the Alpheinthomus family was not yet stopped
 magar is baar jo maut hui wo chaunkaane vaali thi
 a two-year-old girl Alfine was killed in the house
 achaanak saansein ruk gayi
 Just like the other people died in the house
 alphine roy ke chachaa kii beti thi
 January 11, 2016, Sixth Death, Philly After the death of thomasalphine, one day suddenly, Alfine's mother, Philly, also feels restless and dies suddenly
 ye ghar main chhathi maut thi
 This happened exactly as the first five people had been killed
 yani ek hi tarah se hui thi
 The bodies recovered from the graves were Annamma's second son and Roy's brother Rojo Thomas, who lived with his family in the US, away from Kerala
 ek ke baad ek wo bhi ek hi tarah se harek maut ne roji thomas ko sochane par majaboor kar diya
 So he reached Kerala from America
 rozi thomas kerala police ke saath us kabristaan main pahunchi
 Because now, one by one, the corpses were coming out to extract the truth
 pehali maut kii jaanch kaa faislapahele rozo thomas kaa shaq kerala police ko betuka lagata he
 Because there were definitely six deaths
 magar 14 saal ke faasale par
 But the post-mortem report of Rojo's brother Roy was definitely forcing the police to think
 isi ke baad police 2011 main yani ab se aath saal pehle hui roy kii maut kii tafteesh karne kai faisla karti he
 And thus a murder was now going to give a clue of five murders
 bhabhi ne chachaa ke bete se kii shadiroso thomas ko ghar ke chah-chah sadasyon kii maut lagaataar kachot rahi thim
 Parents, brothers, uncles, uncle's son's wife and daughter had died
 magar jo cheez sabase juyada rojo ko pareshaan kar rahi thi wo ye ki chachaa ke bete shaju kii patni phili kii maut ke saal bhar baad hi 2017 main uski bhabhi jolly ne shaju se shaadi kar lee thi
 Suspicion of property papers was confirmed
 After this, when Rojo looked at the property documents of the house, it was found that most of his property was taken by his sister-in-law, Jolly
 wo bhi apane pati roy or saas sasur yani anamma or tom ke farji dastakhat se
 After this Rojo complained to the police and suspected that the six deaths in his family in the last 14 years were not general deaths but slaughter
 iske liye rojo ne apane bhai or jolly ke pati roy kii us postmortem report kaa bhi hawala diya, jisamen sharir main jehar paae jane kii baat kahi gai thi
 The police did this, the officer investigating the case revealed that all the murders were done by Jolly
 usne pehle anamma ko maaraa kyonki wo parivaar kii sabase ahm sadsy thi
 He used to see all the things in the house
 unhen isliye maaraa gaya kyonki unhen markar hi parivaar ke tamaam aarthik faislon par control kiya ja saktaa tha
 Jolly had killed mother-in-law Anamma
 to phir use sasur tom ko maarane kii kya zarurat thi
 After all, what was the reason for Tom's death in Julie's intrigue
 sasur se naaraaz thi jollydoosri maut jolly ke sasur kii thi
 The reason for his murder was that he was continuously selling many properties of the house
 unhone jolly or uske pati ko jaaydaad se bedakhal kar diya tha
 Although initially he had a good relationship with his father-in-law
 magar baad main donon main kuch dikkatein paidaa ho gayi
 He had decided that he would go to America after selling all the properties
 ye baat jolly ko nagavar guzari thi
 Jolly slaughtered her husband
 Now number three comes that of Jolly's husband Roy Thomas
 wo jolly kii saazish kaa shikaar kaise bana
 Roy Thomas, who was murdered because Jolly was shocked to see the property go by hand
 donon main isko lekar aksar vivaad rahane laga tha
 Eventually Jolly kills him as well
 mathew ne kiya tha shaq, isliye gai jaanachauthaa number aayaa mathew manjaadiil kaa jinka thomas parivaar ke is property se koi sidhaa lenaa-dena nahin tha
 But after the constant death in the family, he was looking at Jolly with suspicious eyes
 jolly ko laga ki mathew agar zindaa rahaa to bhed kul jayega
 According to the investigating officer, the next death was of Matthew
 jo roy kii maut ke baad uski body kaa postmortem karaae jane par jor de rahaa tha
 He had become suspicious of Jolly
 or vah in mauton kii vajah kaa khulaasa chahta tha
 The innocent baby girl was also killed
 ghar ke mukhiya tom ke chote bhai zachariya ke bete shaju kii 2 saal kii beti thi alphine
 Why did Jolly kill him
 ye sawaal pareshaan karne vaala tha
 The investigating officer revealed that Jolly was not happy with her husband Roy
 wo aksar kaha karti thi
 He always thought of a husband like Shaju
 wo man hi man shaju se shaadi karnaa chaahati thi
 But it is not possible for Alphine and Philly to be alive
 isliye uske khaane main synide milakar jolly ne use maar daalaa
 Then Shaju's wife was murdered by the alfaline
 ab baari phili kii thi
 Because Jolly could marry Shaju only after killing her
 lihaaza aglaa number phili kaa tha
 Shaju's wife Philly was given the jolly by mixing poison in the water
 jise pite hi uski maut ho gai
 After all these deaths, Jolly got married to Shaju in the year 2017
 parivaar ke 6 logon kii maut ke baad jab jolly ne shaju se shaadi kii, tab pehali baar rojo ne us par shaq kiya
 And he came from America and started investigating this whole matter, then this deep plot of murder was revealed

 In an effort to resolve the crisis, Chief Labor Commissioner NK Prasad held a meeting with the management and the ICPA, but both sides remained adamant on their stand, which led to the negotiations failing

 At the meeting, management was adamant that it would not hold talks with the unregulated labor organization, while the pilots sought to restore the recognition of their organization, remove seals from its offices and reinstate dismissed and suspended employees
 vimanseva ke pratinidhiyon ne yah kehete hue payalton se vaarta karne se inkaar kar diya ki unka sanghathan manyata praapt nahin he or unhone adaalat ke adeshon kaa ulanghan kiya he
 Officials said the pilots, on the other hand, insisted that their union's recognition be restored and that all six sacked pilots be withdrawn

 ek majboot khufia tantra badi-se-badi ladaai main kaise aapako dushman se do kadam aage rakhata he or kamjor tantra kaise haar tay kar detaa he, iskaa sateek udhaaharan chhattisgarh main dekha ja saktaa he, jahaan apane majboot tantra ke bal par maovadi surakshabalon ko dhul chataa rahe hai
 In the past, ever since the army has knocked in Bastar on the pretext of a training center in Abujhmad, hardly a day has passed when the Maoists have not carried out any incident
 durbhagyapurna baat yah he ki maovadiyon ke khilaaf morche par date javaanon ko apane kamjor khufia tantra kii keemat jaan ganvaa kar chukaani pad rahi he jabaki maovadi sateek khufia soochnaaon ke bal par hi kadam-kadam par unhen maat de rahe hai or beete ek maah ke bheetar hi 40 se zyada javaanon ko maut ke ghat utaar chuke hai
 On the basis of information received from their military intelligence late on the night of 10 June, the Maoists boarded a mine-protected vehicle from Dantewada to Katekalyan and blew up a landmine blast near Gatam on the way
 is ghatana main saat espeo (vishesh police adhikari) samet 10 javaanon kii maut ho gai
 The Maoists carried out the incident with the help of the same night vision device that they had looted in April 2010 by attacking the CRPF at Tadmetla
 is ghatana ke baad se, police ke vaahanon kii awajahi, jo ab tak raat main mufeed maani jaati thi, bhi khatre se khaali nahin rahi he
 The information system of the Maoists is so strong that the police are unable to trace it
 haalanki june 2005 main shuru hui salwa judum muhim ne dakshin or pashchimi bastar main maovadiyon ke soochna tantra ko dhwast kar unke hosh phakhta kar die the lekin jald hi unhone nae sire se alag se khufia ikaayiyon kaa gathan kar liya
 Earlier members of LOS (local Organization Squad) and LGS (local Guerrilla Squad) used to get information about the activities of the police only through the villagers, Sangham members, children of the revolutionary tribal women's organization and Bal Sangham but now their information system is three-tier are done
 kareeb paanch saal pehle astitv main ai maovadiyon kii pipuls sikret sarvice (pieses) apane taur-tareekon se suchanaaen ikaithi karti he
 The Maoists have also established their military intelligence and formed the Tactical United Front and the Factional Committee under their Urban Prospective Plan
 inke jariye ve shahari kshetron ke majdoor sanghathanon, karmchaaree sanghathanon or saamaajik sansthaaon main ghuspaith kar logon ko sarkaar or samvidhan ke khilaaf bhadakaane ke saath hi suchanaaen bhi sankalit karte hai
 On the contrary, to get information about the activities of Maoists on the lines of Andhra Pradesh, the police has set up an Intelligence Agency named Special Intelligence Branch (SIB), but due to lack of infrastructure in the last six years, its structure has been properly maintained
 Could not stand rajya ke grih mantri nanakiram kanvar bhi badhati maovadi ghatnaon kii vajah police ke kamjor khufia tantra ko maanate hai
 They bluntly say, "the police intelligence system has failed
" ''tri-stareey soochna tantra ke baavjood maovadiyon kaa mukhya aadhaar dandakaarany adivasee kisaan-majdoor sangh jise sangham sadsy ke naam se zyada janaa jaataa he, hi hai
 Tribals associated with it are still using the methods of giving signals that have been going on for generations
 masalan, ve alag-alag andaaj main tali, siti, dhol, bansuri bajaakar yaa pashu-pakshiyon kii aawaaj nikaalkar yaa phir pedo yaa ghar kii chhaton par rang vishesh kaa kapadaa taangkar police or digar suraksha balon kii gatividhiyon kii jaankaree dekar ilaake main maujuud maovadiyon ko pehle hi aagaah kar dete hai
 Bastar currently has more than one lakh Sangham members
 pichley do saal se yahaan arddh sainik balon kii tainaati ke saath hi maovadi sangham sadasyon ko khaas tavajjo dene lage hai
 These are now organized in the mass militia and LOS and LGS in the presence of top commanders
 duusari ore, behad shaatir ho chuke maovadiyon ke khilaaf gathit police kii khufia agency esaibi kaa dhaancha or karypranali chaunkaane vaali he
 The Maoists are active in two-thirds of the state, but the police headquarters has approved a staff of just 140 for the SIB, which has the same number as cumin in the camel's mouth
 yahi nahin, ab tak sweekrut puure padon par bhartee tak nahin ho saki he
 Only the Superintendent of Police (SP) is posted at Jagdalpur, the headquarters of Bastar, which has 39,000 sq km of land, and only his driver in the name of the staff
 balki espi ko vaahan bhi puure salbhar baad jaakar naseeb ho sakaa he

 Apart from Sori, there are only one sub-inspector, five assistant sub-inspectors and three head constables in five districts of Bastar
 in halaat main samajha ja saktaa he ki esaibi kisi chal rahi he
 Some officers of SIB say with suppressed language that it is not possible to get information without spending money
 paise kaa hi kamaal he ki andhrapradesh kii esaibi ko simavarti rajyon main bhi hone vaali maovadiyon kii gatividhiyon kii jaankaree fouran mil jaati he
 This is the reason why the Maoists in Andhra have been almost wiped out
 iske vipareet pradesh ke halaat din-ba-din bhayaavah hote ja rahe hai
 But police spokesperson Vivekananda, who is also the Deputy Inspector General of the SIB, denies the weakening of the intelligence apparatus, saying that intelligence events cannot be questioned due to one or two incidents
 ve kehete hai, ''esaibi police kaa aantarik maamla he, ise majboot banane kii koshishen jari hai
 "apart from the SIB, there is also an intelligence system of the police captain in the districts, who obtain information with the help of their informers, secret troops and spos
" iske alaava centre sarkaar kaa intligence beuro bhi maovadiyon se sambandhit suchanaaen ikaitha kar rajyon ko detaa he
 With the help of SPO, the police information system has become somewhat stronger
 ilaake ke chappe-chappe se waakif hone ke saath hi ve sthaneey boli ke jaankaar bhi hote hai
 Due to the surrender of Maoists in these, it is also possible for the police to guess their ways
 espeo kii madad se police ne kai safaltaaen bhi hasil kii hai
 With his help, the police are able to enter such areas where it was not able to go for the last two decades
 police ke soochna tantra kii sabase mukhya kadi ye espeo aaj maovadiyon ke sabase bade dushman hai
 In the last five years, Maoists have killed more than 300 spos and their families
 yahi vajah he ki andruni ilaakon main nae logon se koi baat tak karne ko taiyaar hi nahin hota or police ke pahunchane se pehle hi puraa kaa puraa gaanv khaali ho jaataa he or police haath malati rah jaati he
 The Maoists are destroying the police system with the development of information system on the strength of fear
 ve police ke mukhabiron ko bhari jaidaalat main berahami se maut ke ghat utaarne ke baad laash ko milon dur mukhya maarg ke kinare phinkava dete hai taaki ghatana ko zyada prachaar mil sake
 Along with the dead body, they also leave a threatening letter that this will be the result of those who support the police
 kamobesh yahi haal ve un logon kaa bhi karte he, jo unhen jaanate-boojhte hue bhi police kii gatividhiyon kii jaankaree nahin dete
 Not only this, if the police came out on patrol, under pressure, if someone gives them the same food and drink or tells them the way, then they do not even spare him
 vaise bhi salwa judum ke baad police soochna tantra ke majboot hone kaa pradesh vah phayda nahin uthaa paaya jo 60 ke dashak main tateey andhrapradesh ke adivasee bahul sitampeta ilaake main koya vidroh se uthaaya gaya tha jabaki maovadi isaki tulana koya vidroh se hi kar rahe the
 This can be considered as a lack of concrete strategy
 maovadiyon ke khilaaf morche par police kii lagaataar naakaami kii pramukh vajah graminon ke bich uski paith na hona bhi he
 But the police never made any serious effort in this direction, whereas the principle of guerrilla warfare is the same - the victory with which the people
 iske vipareet bhale hi bahari logon ke bich maovadiyon kii chhavi barbar hatyare kii he par ve apane prabhaav vaale ilaake main logon se kaaphi acha vyavhaar rakhte hai
 His image is like a primate among the tribals
 aatmasamarpit maovadi hi bataate hai ki ek aria commander ek aam adivasee ko vaisaa hi sammaan detaa he jaisaa vah apane sheersh commander ko detaa he
 The Maoists are alert all the time, while the negligence of the police is seen as accidents
 gorilla warfare main hameshaa kuch nae andaaj main karrwai kar shatru ko chaunkaaya jaataa he
 The Maoists have been following it from the very beginning as part of their long-term strategy, while the police are still doing the futile exercise of dealing with traditional methods without any concrete strategy
 akatya, abhedya or sudridhbastar main maovadiyon ke tri-stareey soochna tantra main ve praathmik str par pieses, digar sainya, rajnatik ikaayiyon samet sahyogi sanghathanon kii madad se jaankaree hasil karte hai
 After the formation of the State Military Commission in 2009, the Maoists understood the need for military intelligence and also set it up in a year
 military intligence bade hamale se pehle vahaan par suraksha balon se sambandhit tamaam jaankariyaan jutati he or iske saath hi ilaake kaa khaakaa bhi taiyaar kar apni sainya ikaayiyon ko saunp detii he
 Based on this, the Maoists conduct the attack after rehearsing

 unhone kaha ki basapa va congress ek hi sikke ke do pahalu hai
 Everyone knows what the Congress gave to the state during its forty years of rule and corruption was dominated in the BSP regime and the biggest scam took place during the BSP rule itself
