 The Naxals attacked the villagers hiding in the bushes on the shield of the Naxalites when the CRPF detachment was preparing to eat food in the afternoon after surveillance
 ghanton chali is khooni jang main 300 naksaliyon or gaanvvaalon kaa muqabla kar rahe mahaz 33 siarpief ke jawan kamazor tab pade jab gaanvvaale naksaliyon kii dhaal banakar khadey ho gaye
 In such a situation, the CRPF jawans stopped their hands to avoid firing at the villagers, but instead shot themselves on their chests for those who brought them to their deaths

 To revenge him, his arms are bursting

 The Naxalite attack was as dangerous as the Naxalite attack in the Inside Storysukama, its insider story is as disturbing
 naksaliyon ne siarpief ke javaanon par beshak achaanak ghaat lagaakar hamalaa kiya ho, lekin is hamale kii saazish kaafii gahari thi or lambey vakt se chal rahi thi
 The manner in which the attack was carried out, the preparations and the disguise done in disguise before the attack are evidence of this in themselves
 ye sukama main hue is saal ke sabase bade naksali hamale kii insaide story he
 Yes, there is an inside story of four lines, but in this inside story, there are such screws of the deep intrigue of the Naxalites that the mind wanders by listening

 Those who had put a cloak of innocence on their face from above
 lekin andar se is saazish main naksaliyon kaa saath de rahe the
 Unbelievable, this disclosure is made by the same lion of Sukma, who came back alive after facing a barrage of bullets from the Naxalites and saw everything with his own eyes
 ab ye in gaanvvaalon kii koi majaburi thi yaa phir vaaki unki niyat main khot tha, ye to vahi bataa sakate hai
 Made up of women and children Dhalanxali used about 50 women and children as a shield

 They were also attacking with hand-made grenades during the attack
 hamalaavaron main 50 mahila naksali bhi shaamil thim
 25 INSAS rifles and 6 AK 47s and a rocket launcher were looted from the jawans
 vaise jab tak aamane-saamne kii jang chali siarpief ne bhi kai naksaliyon ko maut kii neend sula diya
 But since many of his own soldiers had been killed, he thought it more important to take his soldiers to hospitals than to recover the bodies of the Naxalites

 There have been suggestions to eliminate Naxalism in the country

 The Narendra Modi government has started an exercise towards rejuvenation of the country's minorities
 sarkaar alpsankhyakon ke liye behatar shiksha ke saath-saath madrason ke shikshakon ko khaas training dekar modern ajukeshan se jodygi
 Along with this, Madrasas will also be linked with knowledge science, computer, internet, e-learning and smart education system
 modi sarkaar ke is kadam ko muslim sanghathan or buddhijivi musalamaano ke liye sakaaratmak kadam bataa rahe hai
 At the same time, Islamic scholars are calling it airborne statement
 kya kehete hai mukhtaar abbaas nakwikendriya alpsankhyak kalyaan mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi kehete hai ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv vaali insaaf, imaan or ikbaal kii sarkaar ne vikaas kii sehat ko sampradayikta evam tushtikaran kii beemaari se mukti dilaai he or shashaktikaran kaa maahaul taiyaar kar diya he
 Naqvi says that school dropout girls of minority class will be linked to education and employment by providing them bridge courses from reputed educational institutions of the country
 deshbhar ke madrason main mukhyadhara kii shiksha ko protsaahit karne ke liye madrasa shikshakon ko vibhinn shaikshanik sansthaanon jaise jamiya milia islamia or aligarh muslim uniwarsity aadi se prashikshan dilaayaa jayega
 So that they can impart knowledge of mainstream education in madrasas Hindi, English, Mathematics, Science and Computer etc
 modi sarkaar ke is kadam ko jamiyat ulema-e-hind ke mahasachiv moulana mahmud madani ne swaagat karte hue kaha, 'musalamaanon ko aupchaarik shiksha se joda janaa chahie
 Equal opportunities should be provided to all sections of society for the benefit of the country, especially in the field of education
 ham hameshaa is tarah kii pahal kaa swaagat karenge
 'making a modern step without interfering with madrasas is a positive step: Kamal Farooqui, former chairman of the Delhi Minorities Commission and Kamal Farooqui, who runs several educational institutions for Muslims, says that if Modi government arranges for modern education without any manipulation and change in madrasas So this is a welcome move
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jis tarah loksabhaa chunaav ke baad 26 may ko apane saansadon ko sambodhit karte hue musalamaanon ko lekar baaten kahin he, ise sakaaratmak rup se liya janaa chahie
 He said that the country cannot be brought on the path of progress and development by putting 200 million Muslims behind
 faruki ne kaha ki madrason ke shikshakon ko training dene ke saath-saath agar sarkaar vahaan ignu or NIOS (nation institute of open schooling) ke centre kholkar aadhunik shiksha se jodatii he to kisi ko etraj nahin he
 Apart from this, the government should also make an order that the students coming out of the madrasa should be given admission in all the universities of the country
 abhi desh ke jamiya milia islamia, aligarh muslim uniwarsity, jeenyu or moulana aaazaad urdu vishvavidhyalay main hi admician diya jaataa he
 The government's move is air-air: Maulana Hamid Nomani, the general secretary of All India Muslim Majlis Mushawarat Maulana Hamid Nomani, who called the Modi government's move to air, said who has stopped the linking of madrasas with modern education
 desh main jo madrase sarkaar se manyata praapt hai or fund lete hai unhen aap behatar banaaie, lekin modi sarkaar kuch karne ke bajaay sirf mudda banaakar charchaa main rahane chaahati he
 How will she move away from the RSS ideology and improve the education system of Muslims is an important question
 sarkari skulon main chat nahin he
 Children are studying under the tree and talks are being done about madrasas
 'modi sarkaar dwaara madrason or uske shikshakon ko modern bananaa saraahneey kadam'jabaki, dilli ke fatehpuri masjid main chal rahe madrase ke kaari asaraarul haq kaasmi kehete hai ki sarkaar madrason main bina hastakshep kiye hue agar modern ajukeshan se jodatii he to behatar kadam he
 Modern education is very important and every madrasa needs to be hi-tech
 modi sarkaar agar ek bajet nirdhaarit kar madrason main padhaane vaale shikshakon ko hitech or aadhunik shiksha kii training detii to yah swaagat yogya kadam he
 Kasami says that he is successful in the Islamic cause of madrasas
 islamic shiksha se jindagi jeene kaa salika miltaa he, lekin jindagi kii jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye tarakkee bhi kerani he
 Madrasas are behind in this direction
 aise main agar modi sarkaar madrason or uske shikshakon ko marden banane kaa kadam badhaati he to saraahneey kadam hai
 This is the need of the hour for Muslims

 Significantly, in 1998 the Ramji Mahajan Commission in Madhya Pradesh had recommended 27 percent reservation for backward classes instead of 14 percent, but people went to court against it and this recommendation could not be implemented till date

 The two-member team from Pakistan to India had to spend several hours at the Wagah border to take stock of the security arrangements for the India and Pakistan matches
 iske peeche vajah ye thi ki do main se ek sadsy aazam khan ke visa main gadabadi thi
 Something happened that when Pakistan decided to send a 2-member security team from Pakistan to look into their security preparations before their cricket team, one of those two, Usman Anwar, despite being on Sunday, got visa from Indian High Commission given away
 duusare sadsy aazam khan ko bhi visa lene ko kaha gaya lekin aazam khan ne ye kehete hue visa nahin liya ki unke paas pehle se bharat kaa visa he
 When Khan along with Usman Anwar entered India via the Wagah border, his visa turned out to be not a road but air route
 is visa main daakhil hone vaale shahar ke taur par dilli darj tha
 That means they could not enter that road
 isliye unako wagha imigration par roak liya gaya
 Both India and Pakistan give visas to each other's citizens according to the city
 yani jis shahar kaa visa hoga vahiin ja sakate hai
 Not only this, it has to be mentioned on the visa form that through which route they will enter from one country to another
 tippaniyan When information about Azam Khan's case was given to the Ministry of External Affairs, he immediately came into action
 kyonki maamla cricket match kii suraksha gauge se judaa tha isliye mantrayal ne ise special cese ke taur par liya
 The Ministry of External Affairs wrote to the Ministry of Home Affairs, advocating for necessary changes in Khan's visa
 pakistani nagarikon ke visa se sambandhit antim faisle grih mantralay hi karata he
 The Ministry of Home Affairs also approved a change in Khan's visa
 iske baad hi osman or khan donon wagha se dharmashala ke liye ravaanaa ho sake
 Meanwhile, Pakistan Deputy High Commissioner Ubaidur Rahman had reached Nizamani Dharamshala

 The other member Azam Khan was also asked to take a visa but Azam Khan did not take a visa saying that he already had a visa to India
 osman anwar ke saath khan ne jab wagha border ke zarie bharat main pravesh kiya to unka visa sadak maarg kaa nahin balki hawaii maarg kaa niklaa
 Delhi was registered as the city to be admitted in this visa
 matlab vah sadak maarg ye nahin daakhil ho sakate the
 Therefore, they were stopped at Wagah immigration
 bharat or pakistan donon desh ek duusare ke nagarikon ko visa shahar ke hisaab se dete hai
 That is, the city that has a visa can go there itself
 itnaa hi nahin visa form par ye bhi ullekh karnaa padataa he ki ve kis maarg se ek se duusare desh main pravesh karenge
 The comments aazam khan ke maamle kii jaankaree jab videsh mantralay ko di gai wo turant harqat main aa gaya
 Because the matter was related to the security of the cricket match, the ministry took it as a special case
 khan ke visa main zaruri tabdili kii pairvi karte hue videsh mantralay ne grih mantralay likh diya
 The Ministry of Home Affairs makes the final decision regarding visas for Pakistani citizens
 grih mantralay ne bhi khan ke visa main tabdili par apni muhar laga di

 cambridge analitica data scandle ke maamle par wo sawaalon ke jawaab de rahe the
 Let me tell you that Mark Zuckerberg avoided many questions, gave a chilling answer or said that his team will follow up with the senator asking questions
 C-SPAN kii tronscript ke mutabik mark jakarberg ne testimony ke dauraan lagbhag 15 baar kaha, ‘hamaari team aapke saath follow ap karegi’clic karen or padhein mark jakarberg par kaise hue tikhe sawaalon ke bauchhaar or kya the unke javabjab senetter ne poocha ki kya fasebuk se conect kiye gaye divaais of hone ke baad bhi divaais trek karata he
 In response to this question, he said that we do not have the answer to this question yet and it can be answered later
 ek senetter ne fasebuk par rangabhed or bhedbhaav kaa bhi aarope lagaaya or kaha ki is bhedbhaav ko lekar is desh kaa itihaas kharaab rahaa he
 Facebook is promoting discrimination
 fasebuk par logon main bhedbhaav karne vaale vigyaapan hai or is par kaabo nahin paa rahaa he
 On this question, Mark Zuckerberg said that this question is important and it can be overcome with artificial intelligence
 haalanki unhone yah bhi kaha he ki company sabhi chizon ko ek-ek karke rivyuu nahin kar sakati he or aisa karnaa mushkil he
 The Senator asked Mark Zuckerberg, 'we have deleted Facebook, you say that we are the users of the data, so do you delete that data? If you do, how long does it take? Why was the data you gave to the advertising companies? Mark Zuckerberg found it difficult to answer this question
 iske jawaab main unhone pehle to kaha ki fasebuk delit hone ke baad aapkaa data bhi delit ho jaataa he, lekin unhone iskaa jawaab nahin diya ki isamen kitna samay lagata he
 Along with this, after giving the data to the advertising companies, they have also responded roundly
 aakhir main unhone kaha ki is jawaab ke liye main yaa meri team aapke saath follow ap karegi
 Regarding Artificial Intelligence, he said in response to many people that through this technology, he is overcoming things like hate speech on Facebook
 lekin jab unase poocha gaya ki asal main artificial intelligence ko kaise company ke liye utilise kar rahe hai to unhone kaha ki main yah sunishchit kar saktaa hum kii meri team is jaankaree ko lekar aapke saath follow ap karegi
 Overall, he postponed the difficult questions by asking them to follow up
 ab dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki unki team kis tarah kii jaankariyon ke saath follow ap karti he
 The example of how kind the Congress government is over Mayawati, the former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, is given by the fact that she was allotted three bungalows in Lutyens Zone, the most important area of delhi
 usase bhi dilachasp baat yah he ki in teenon ko milakar ek vishaal mahabangla bana diya gaya
 It is believed that the total area of this super bungalow will be around 28,800 square feet and no such minister has such a big bungalow
 kendriya mantriyon ke bangale amuman 4,800 varg foot ke hote hai or tip 8 kaa bangala 8,250 varg foot kaa hota he
 This super bungalow has been prepared by combining three such bungalows
 in teenon kii chahardivari ko todakar inhen puri tarah mila liya gaya he
 The Type 8 bungalow consists of eight bed rooms, four servants quarters, two garages, front and rear lawns
 bangalon ko is tarah milaanaa kanoonee taur par galat he
 Not only this, large scale unauthorized constructions have been done in them
 kichan, kamare or toilet to banaae hi gaye hai, fibre shit kii chhaten bhi banaakar jagah gheri gai he
 Mayawati has been allotted three bungalows in Gurdwara Rakabganj area of new Delhi
 rakabganj road par bangala number 12, 14 or 16 unhen die gaye hai
 The names of Bungalows Nos
 14 and 15 have been removed from these
 dilachasp baat yah bhi he ki mayawati ko gurdvara rakabganj road par hi ek or sarkari bangala aavantit kiya gaya he or vah he 4 number
 RTI activist Subhash Aggarwal sought information about them under Right to Information
 unhen bataaya gaya ki yah ikai bahujan prerana trust ko di gai thi or mayawati hi is trust kii dekhbhaal karti thim
 Under this, it is also reported that the Mahabangala was allotted to the Trust by the Ministry of Urban Development
 usne hi teenon bangalon ko milaane kii anumati bhi di thi
 Mayawati was given the bungalow of 4 Gurdwara Rakab Ganj Road as the President of Bahujan Samajwadi Party
 isamen bhi avaidh nirmaan kiya gaya he
 It has a temporary structure of 145 square meters
 iske alaava iske parisar kii chahardivari ko ooncha kar diya gaya he
 Three or four rooms adjoining these walls have also been built
 subhash agarwal ne in tarah se hue aavanton ke maamle par jaanch kii maang kii he
 They have also asked how the CPWD kept their eyes closed against this illegal allocation
 unhone yah bhi jaananaa chaha he ki aavanti ne kaise teen bangalon ko milakar ek bana diya
 He has also voiced an inquiry against the Directorate of Estate officials who combined three bungalows into one Mahabangala and handed it over to a person who did illegal construction there
 jab bhi daftar main aapke compyur yaa laptop par virus aata he to akasar sidhe-sidhe ye aarope laga diya jaataa he ki aapane koi galat link clic kiya hoga yaa koi porn site dekhi hogi, lekin ab khulaasa hua he ki is maamle main bos bhi kuch kam nahin
 Let us know that viewing more porn sites increases the risk of viruses on the device
 akasar karmchaariyon par ye aarope lagata rahata he ki ve internet par maujuud aisa-vaisaa link kar dete hai, jisase daftar kii suraksha main send lag jaati he
 But now a study has revealed that the company bosses are not behind in damaging the security
 threattrack sicurity kii research se khulaasa hua he ki 40 fisadi sicurity profeshnals ne paaya ki unke company ke senior bos ke divaais (computer, laptop or mobile) par virus kaa hamalaa isliye hua kyonki un par porn website dekhi gai thi
 At the same time, 60 per cent security professionals said that they have removed the virus from the device of their company's senior officers when they click on a wrong link or they receive money from a phishing mail (the purpose of such emails is password, such as password
 To steal
 sibar criminal inkaa istemaal karte hai
 ) Is deceived
 yahi nahin, 45 fisadi ne kaha ki unhen senior afasar ke divaais par tab bhi virus mila jab unhone apane ghar ke kisi sadsy ko uskaa istemaal karne diya
 In addition, a third of the security professionals said that the officers of their company had a virus on their mobiles because they had downloaded a bad app
 aapako bataa den ki is survey main america kii badi bijness companiyon main kaam karne vaale 200 sicurity profeshnals ko shaamil kiya gaya tha

 bombai times kii report ke mutabik, donon main kariyar ko lekar bahut bahes hoti he
 Quoting sources, the website had written - There is a constant debate between the two about each other's careers
 abhinav ko shweta kii safalataa se samasya he
 Shweta Tiwari's relationship with her second husband also soured, will marriage break? However, Abhinav has said in a statement that everything is fine between him and Shweta
 unhone kaha- hamaare bich sab thik he
 i am never insecure with Shweta's success
 ham donon apane kariyar par focus kar rahe hai or khush hum
 Significantly, Shweta and Abhinav met on the sets of the show
 donon ne 2013 main shaadi karne se pehle teen saal tak date kiya tha
 Before this, Shweta married Raja Chaudhary
 shaadi ke 9 saal baad saal 2007 main donon ne talaak le liya tha

 cricket main bhi ajibo-garib sanyog dekhne ko milte hai
 a similar coincidence also happened during India's innings on the third day of the first Test match against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens
 yah rahaa teesraa sanyog! yah sanyog dekhne ko mila dilaruvaan perera kii ore se phenke gaye pari ke 52wein over ke dauraan or yah teesraa sanyog mahaj paanch hi gendon ke bheetar hua

 darasal 52wein over kii teesri gend par rabindra jadeja ne defensive stroke khelaa or srilankai khilaadiyon kii kaich kii apil par ampire wilson ne nakaar diya
 On this, the Sri Lankan team demanded a review

 And this review proved to be correct
 jadeja tisare ampire kii samiksha main kaich kii apil se to batch gaye, lekin elbeadblyoo qaraar die
 After receiving an opinion from the third umpire, on-field umpire Wilson changed his decision and called Jadeja out
 shuruyaat main camere main pehali baar ko laga ki vastav main gend unki baanh se lag kar gai he, lekin thodi hi der main saaf ho gaya ki gend ne unke balle kaa bahari kinaaraa bhi liya tha
 And this third coincidence (third umpire) within four balls returned the pavilion to two of India's fierce batsmen

 " paraali jalaane kii ghatnaon main kami ke sanketahawa main sudhaar, pradooshan se mil sakati he raahatrajdhani dilli or aas-paas ke ilaakon main pradooshan ke lihaaj se acchhee khabar aa rahi he
 In Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, there has been a decrease in cases of burning paddy straw, the waste portion of the paddy crop
 pichley hafte dilli main pradooshan kaa str vishwa swasthya sanghathan yani WHO ke maanak se 15 guna upar pahunch gaya tha
 India Today's Data Intelligence Unit (DIU), after analyzing data from the MODIS and WIRES satellite platforms under nasa's Firm Project, found that stubble burning in North India has decreased by nearly 88% since November 10 
 haalanki, giravat kaa trend aage bhi jari rahegaa yaa nahin is bare main koi jaankaree nahin he
 Last time also the number decreased for three to four days but again the farmers started burning stubble
 haalanki, gehun bone kaa samay bhi ab nikalataa ja rahaa he, isliye paraali kii ghatana main kami aane kii sambhaavna zyada he
 The satellite issued alerts for thousands of fire incidents through thermal imagery in many areas of North India including Punjab, Haryana
 pehle se duniya ke pradooshit shaharon main awwal maane jane vaale dilli shahar kii hawa or jahrili ho gai
 Despite the Supreme Court's prohibition, incidents of stubble occurred especially in Punjab and Haryana
 hawa kii gati or disha jab-jab dilli kii ore hui tab-tab pehle se pradooshan kii maar jhel rahi dilli main haalat bad se badtar hone lagi
 In the first three days of last week, more than seven thousand cases of stubble burning were reported in other states of North India including Punjab, Haryana, UP

 5 condensed and dissolved in Delhi air
 invarjan yani hawa main smog yaa jaharila dhuaan ke liye paraali ke saath-saath mausam ke thanda hone hawa kii gati kam rahanaa ise jahrili bana detaa he
 Therefore, the level of pollution varies from city to city
 dilli kii bhugolic banaavat, lakhon gadiyon or thermal stesan kii vajah se hawa saal main maatr ek yaa do din saamaanya rahati he
 In such a situation, the smoke coming from the stubble dissolves the poison in the air here
 udhaaharan ke liye diaiu ne sabase khatarnaak pradooshan kan PM2
 5 Those who are unable to stop the nose hair and masks of people, checked the average level every hour in Delhi
 hamane paaya ki 15 november ko yah sabase 600 ke upar pahunch gaya tha
 It should have been 25 by WHO standard
 puure hafte ke 24 ghante kaa str kii gananaa ke baad paaya ki pichley hafte ke dauraan ausatan har samay PM2
 5 was 15 times the WHO standard
 haalanki paraali kii ghatnaon kii kami kaa asar abhi dilli kii hawa par kuch khaas nahin hua he, lekin shanivaar se pradooshan ke str main giravat ke sanket milane lage hai
 There is a relief in the air quality index ie AQI in cities of North India
 ravivaar (17 november) ko saat baje gurugram main PM2
 5 AQI was 107, while Delhi's 259 (6 am), Faridabad 266, Noida 218, Ghaziabad 226, Lucknow 254, Moradabad 209, Kanpur 327, Varanasi 304, Patna 344, Kolkata 236 were recorded
 ye sabhi aankade ravivaar subah 6 ke hai
 The most affected by poisonous air is in the cities of North India
 jahaan dhul or dhuen ke saath andhadhundh construction puure saal chalata rahata he
 The large number of vehicles, thermal power plants and cold stubble burning in Delhi make it more dangerous
 isliye inamen se koi bhi kisi tarah kam hota he to dilli ko thodi raahat mahasoos hoti he
 Delhi may get immediate relief due to reduced cases of stubble burning, but is not expected to be completely free from pollution
 uttar pradesh main pilibhit jile kii ek court ne kendriya mantri calraj mishra ke khilaaf gairajamaanti warrant jari kiya he
 He is accused of violating the code of conduct during the 2009 Lok Sabha elections

 puure desh main is baar monsoon saamaanya rahane or distribution behatar rahane kaa asar kheti par dikhne laga he
 The area under sowing of kharif crops is around 36 as compared to last year
 66 lakh hectare zyada rahaa he
 According to the latest data from the Ministry of Agriculture, the total sowing area of kharif as on 1 September is 1033
 99 lakh hectare pahunch gaya he, jabaki pichley saal is samay yah aankada 997
 It was 11 lakh hectares
 kharif fasal kii buvaai zyada rahane ke peeche jo sabase bada kaaran mana ja rahaa he wo he sahi vakt par barish kii shuruyaat or barish kaa samaan vitaran hona he
 At the beginning of the monsoon season i
e
 from the second week of June, the rain in the country gained momentum and this situation remains so far
 is vajah se kisaanon ne kharif kii fasalon kii bad-chadhakar buvaai kii
 Paddy is the main crop of the Kharif season and its dependence on monsoon is to a large extent
 is baar acchhee barish ke chalate desh main dhan kii buvaai kaa rakabaa pichley saal ke 364
 372 against 43 lakh hectares
 95 lakh hectare rahaa he
 That is, there is an increase in acreage in paddy producing states
 dhan kii buvaai behatar rahane ke saath joardaar barish kaa daur chalane kii vajah se iske utpaadan main badhotaree ke saath hi is baar kisaanon kii laagat kam rahane kii puri sambhaavna najar aa rahi he
 But the question is whether farmers will get better prices this time or not
 mote anaajon kii kharif buvaai bhi is baar pichley saal ke mukaable takreeban 10 lakh hectare badhkar 184
 13 lakh hectares have been recorded
 sarson or moongfalee jaisi tilhan fasalon kaa buvaai rakabaa bhi kharif sijan ke dauraan pichley saal ke mukaable 1 lakh hectare badhkar 179
 It has become 6 million hectares
 vahiin duusari taraf ganne kii baat karen to iskaa buvaai rakabaa pichley saal ke mukaable 5 lakh hectare ghatakar 45
 There has been 77 lakh hectares
 dalhan kii baat karen is saal iske buvaai rakabe main joardaar badhotaree dekhi gai he
 Sowing of pulses till September 1 last year 106
 92 lakh hectare rakabe main hui thi
 But this time sowing of pulses crops in kharif season 142
 02 lakh hectare rahaa he
 This simply means that at this time the effect of increased prices of pulses and good monsoon are also visible on the sowing of pulses
 joardaar buvaai ke chalate daalon kii keemton main narmi kaa rukh aana shuru ho gaya he
 It is anticipated that pulses prices will fall further in the coming months

 ' In a suspected case of murder for the sake of false pride, a man shot his daughter and her lover after they were spotted together in Chandpurana village in Moga district, Punjab

 The SHO said that efforts are on to nab the absconding accused father
 bhartiya dand samhita kii vibhinn dhaaraon ke tahat ek maamla darj kar liya gaya he
 It was the first match of the 2011 World Cup in Dhaka and everyone in India was talking about revenge
 bangladesh ne caribbean main bharat ko 2007 vishwa cap ke pehle mukaable main haraaya tha or phir jo hua, vah bhartiya cricket ke itihaas ke sabase dardanaak adhyyon main se ek ban gaya
 Revenge of that defeat was to restore that superiority
 virendra sahvaag ne pehali gend par hi chaukaa lagaakar jataa diya ki is baar koi galati nahin hogi
 His explosive 170 runs and 101 runs of young Virat Kohli helped India secure an easy win
 sahvaag, tendulkar, dhoni or yuvaraj ne us 'badla abhiyaan' ke puraa hone ke baad raahat kii saans lee thi or kohli ke liye to yah match bas jashn manaane ke avasar kii tarah tha
 Kohli did not experience the pain of 2007 and 2011 was a bold expedition for him
 kohli kii captaini main haalanki bharat ne under-19 kaa vishwa cap jeeta tha par 2011 kii us team main ve bachche jaise the or duusare varisht khiladinnon kii tarah naakaami ke boj tale dabe nahin the
 So they could not understand the relief and joy of the victory that was found after the painful defeat
 shaayad isliye ve vishwa cap vijay kii us khushi kaa anubhav nahin kar sake honge jo auron ne kii thi
 Of course he too was very happy with the victory but could not be as emotional as Tendulkar, whose eyes were glazed over after the victory
 tendulkar ne is pratishthit trophy ke liye 22 saal kaa lanbaa intjaar kiya tha
 Kohli became a partner of the World Cup trophy-winning team in just three years
 2015 main nakshaa badal chukaa tha
 Kohli had now become the mainstay of the team's batting and he was expected to play an important role in winning the World Cup to this team
 tendulkar ke sanyas ke baad ve bharat ke liye taabeej kii tarah the or chele ne guru kii jagah le lee thi
 He is undoubtedly the best player in limited overs games
 ek ballebaaj ke rup main apane kariyar kii chotii par hai
 They are making new records and will soon surpass Tendulkar's record of 49 ODI centuries
 kohli vishwacap 2019 kii ummiido se waakif hai
 They know how much is at stake in this
 unke saath bebaak baatcheet ke kuch ansh:aapane jitne bhi toornament khele hai, kya 2019 kaa vishwa cap unamem sabase mahatvapurn he?vishwa cap se bada kuch nahin ho saktaa
 When i look back, i have to say that in 2011 i was young and i was not pressured to make decisions
 hamaari team jis tarah kii thi, usamen mujhe karnaa bas itnaa hi tha ki acha khelnaa tha
 The 2015 tournament was different in that i was involved in more sports than before but still, i did not have to be a part of all meetings and decision-making sessions
 ab captain ke rup main yah thodaa alag he
 i know that i will be responsible for the decision and it is my responsibility to make sure that we move in the right direction in England
 yahi baat is vishwa cap ko un sabhi toornaments main sabase bada banaati he jisamen maine ab tak khelaa he
 And as a batsman? You are probably batting your best
 aapane pichley kuchhek varshon main har saal saat yaa aath shatak lagaae hai or ab sachin tendulkar ke 49 ekadivasiy shatakon ke record ke daravaaje par dastak de rahe hai
 Does this give you new confidence in this World Cup? i have been asked this question many times in the last few weeks
 main eemaandaaree se kahuun to nahin jaanata ki meri kshamta ke hisaab se yahi meri sabase acchhee ballebaaji he
 Yes, i have done well and i am well aware that there will be a fall at some point
 lekin main us par dhyaan dene vaala nahin hum
 i am currently winning and trying to win matches for my team
 sirf yahi ek cheez he jiskaa koi matlab he
 If some records are broken in the process, it is fine
 keval ek cheez jo myne rakhti he vah he bharat kii jeet or main isamen yogadan dene ke liye apni puri koshish karata hum
 The team has been announced and you have a team of 15 fighters
 aap isse puri tarah se santusht hai? kya yah sabase acchhee or complit team he jise ham chun sakate the?beshak
 We have taken care of all sides in this team
 hamaare paas achche ballebaaj hai or vijay shankar or hardik pandya jaise triayami kshamta vaale khilaadi hai
 We have a very good spin attack with Kuldeep (yadav), (yuzvendra) Chahal and (ravindra) Jadeja and we also have a fast offensive bowler
 lambey samay tak hamane number 4 par kai khiladinnon ko aajamaaya lekin vijay shankar ke aane ke saath vah jagah puri ho gai he
 He is a great batsman, a very good fielder and can also bowl 4-5 overs in the middle of an innings
 ham hameshaa se ek tri-aiami khilaadi chaahate the or hamaari jis bhi vipakshi team ke paas aise khilaadi hai unhen ham hairat se dekha karte the
 Now we have such players and i must say that i am happy with Vijay's inclusion in the team
 haalanki abhi iskaa faisla nahin hua he ki koun kis sthaan par ballebaaji karegaa lekin vijay ke aa jane se team india kii takat or bad gai he
 You have always talked warmly about Dhoni
 jab unka pradarshan thodaa dhalaan par tha, to aapane logon se sanyam rakhkar intjaar karne ko kaha
 
 
 We have always known what Mahendra Singh Dhoni has brought with him in this game
 jab log unke peeche haath dhokar pad gaye the, to mujhe laga ki yah to unke saath anyaay ho rahaa he
 There was a solid reason for what we said at that time
 hamane is pahalu par detel main baat kii ki agar ve yahaan nahin hote hai to ham kya-kya chijen ganvaa baithenge
 Between 35 and 50 overs in a one-day match, it is Mahi Bhai who adjusts the fielding from behind the stumps, as he stands in the best position to do so
 mujhe maidan main kinare kii taraf fielding kerani hoti he kyonki main usee kshetra main rahakar team main sabase zyada countribute kar saktaa hum
 We have a relationship of complete trust and respect
 main bhaagyashaalee hum ki mujhe unke jaise vyakti kaa saath mila he jo meri is puri yatra main mere saath rahe hai or khel ke sandarbh main dekhen to ve mere bare main lagbhag sab kuch jaanate hai
 After a long time, this World Cup is going to be the most competitive, in which every team participating is to play with all the other teams
 dakshin africa (5 june), australia (9 june), newjiland (13 june) or 16 june ko pakistan ke khilaaf bharat ke shuruaati chaar mukaable kathin honge
 i see these bouts as an opportunity
 in chaar mushkil tiimon ke saath shuruyaat hogi or inamen se har khel main kadaa muqabla hoga
 If we beat them and give a statement from them, then our campaign will get strengthened
 aapako aakraamak hone kii jarurat hoti he, vishwa cap main jokhim lene ke liye taiyaar rahanaa padataa he
 Instead of playing a few easy matches in the beginning, i am happy to play with bigger teams as this will set the campaign ahead of us
 hamaara dhyaan sirf behatar cricket khilne par he
 Have you dreamed of standing on the Lord's balcony with the World Cup trophy on July 15? No, of course not
 jaisaa ki maine kaha, main vartmaan main rahanaa chahta hum or ek baar main ek hi kadam badhaata hum
 We have nine games first, then a semi-final and only then a final
 ham ek baar main ek match ko dhyaan main rakhkar aage badhenge

 Bigg Boss 13 debuted on Sunday night
 premier ke maukey par sho ke host salmaan khan ne sabhi contestants ko janata se rubaru karavaaya
 Bigg Boss 13 also featured Rashmi Desai, Siddharth Shukla, Paras Chhabra, Daljeet Kaur and Devoleena Bhattacharjee as well as Bollywood actress Koyna Mitra
 big bos 13 main koyna ke hissaa lene ke charche bahut the or is bade event main unki entry dekhne laayak thi
 Black outfits were chosen by Saki Saki Girl, Koyna Mitra, for her entry in Bigg Boss
 salmaan ne koyna ko 12wein contestant ke rup main bulaayaa, lekin uske baad kuch aisa hua ki sab hans pade
 Actually, Salman's tongue slipped while introducing Koyna and he took the name of Katrina Kaif
 is baat kaa andaja khud salmaan khan ko bhi lag gaya tha, jaise hi unhen ehsaas hua wo hansate hue bole main to katrina kehane ja rahaa tha

 Bigg Boss 13 is also going to rock something similar
 bataa den ki koyna mitra ne musafir, apana sapana mani mani jaisi filmon main kaam kiya he
 Apart from this, he has also worked in many music videos
 big bos 13 ke ghar main entry karne se pehle koyna ne mahalaya kii shubhakamanaayen sabhi phens ko di thi or kaha tha ki kaise ve is baar durga puja miss karengi
 Lalu came to the stage and thronged
 kuch aisa hi najaara buudhvaar ko argedy kii parivartan raily main dekhne ko mila
 Lalu organized the rally but he himself reached Gandhi Maidan by about three hours late
 par jab pahunche, to chand hi minuton main puure kaarykram kii kaman sambhaal lee
 First started to remove the crowd present on the stage
 maidan main khadi bheed bekaabu hui, to mike ke jariye hi unhen bhi nirdesh dene lage
 This sequence continued for a few minutes
 agar gussa aata, to samarthakon ko daant bhi daalate
 When Lalu gets into action, then someone who does not listen to him
 aakhirkaar 10 minute ke andar hi vyavastha chust-durust ho gai or kaarykram apane plan ke mutabik sarapat chaalu
 But what should workers also do? Repeated feelings should not be controlled
 bich-bich main narebaaji karne lagate
 But Lalu did not like this slogan
 baat lalu kii naapsand kii ho, to kaaryakartaaon ko bhaawanaaon par niyantran karnaa hi padegaa
 Lalu's stage management did not stop here
 apane bhaashan ke dauraan bhi chir-parichit andaaj main samarthakon ko daantate najar aaen
 When ever targeting opponents, they do not miss the opportunity to hold a 'class' of enthusiastic supporters
 aakhir baat jab lalu kii ho, to unke is anokhe andaaj ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Whether or not the change will bring change in Bihar, it is a matter of later, but the entire country saw the change in a few minutes from Lalu's stage management

 com / s9mpvgwoih — UTV Motion Pictures (@utvfilms) August 13, 2015 Watch the film 'katti Batti' song Sarafira: jab china kii peking uniwarsity main 1960 main sanskrit kii padhai shuru hui to yahaan saikadon saal se thahari hui parampara ko punerjeevan mila tha
 After Hieun Song's visit to India in the seventh century, reading Sanskrit became a ritual for Chinese scholars
 isaki vajah yah thi ki sanskrit ke boote ve buddha granthon kaa anuwaad karne main sakasham ho jate the
 Buddhism took root in China, but Sanskrit studies gradually ended
 1940 ke dashak main sanskrit or pali kaa gyaan rakhane vaale aadhunik daur ke china ke mahaan bharatvid ji jiyanalin ne jab peking uniwarsity main nae paathyakram kaa jimmaa sambhala tab huyang baoseng mahaj 18 saal ke the
 He has prepared a research essay on Vedic literature
 paanch dashak ke academik kareer main huyang ne bhagavadgita, upanishdon se lekar buddha sahitya lalitvistaar sutara or vajrachhedika yaa hirak sutara jaise saikadon granthon kaa anuwaad kiya
 Today, their combination in Sanskrit and Pali language is none in the world
 bhashaa ke prati huyang ke samarpan ko dekhte hue maanav sansaadhan mantralay ke tahat dimd uniwarsity rashtriya sanskrit santhaan ne unhen 15 agast, 2011 ko raashtrapati ke prashasti patr se vibhooshit kiya
 Huyang was the only international person to receive this honor that year
 is sammaan ke saath paanch lakh ru
 Award is also given
 lekin aankh ke rog se pareshaan 72 varshiya huyang raashtrapati pratibha patil se sammaan lene bharat nahin aa sake
 The honor was long due to Huyang and his colleagues from China's most prestigious academic institution, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS)
 lekin yah puraskaar lalaphitaashahee main funs gaya
 Due to this, the educational exchange of the two countries is being disrupted
 huyang ko prashasti patr to mil gaya, lekin santhaan ne kaha ki puraskaar kii raashi tabhi di ja sakati he jab form par unke dastakhat ko koi chini bank pramanit kare
 But Chinese banks argue that Chinese law does not give them the right to authenticate any form that has not been issued by the Chinese government
 lalaphitaashahee ke liye kukhyat bainkon ne spasht kah diya ki ve jamaa khate kaa maanak certificate to de sakate hai lekin huyang ke jivit hone kaa pramaan-patr nahin de sakate
 In August 2013, a certificate of account at Huyang's Chinese Bank was sent to the institute via email
 santhaan yaa maanav sansaadhan mantralay se koi jawaab nahin mila to is saal april main unhone beijing main bhartiya duutavas ko likhaa
 The Embassy responded that it had no record of Huayang's award, so send a copy of it
 is saal june main duutavas ko prati email kii gai
 But till now no response was received
 is maamle ko dekhne vaaleen santhaan main pariyojna prabharee shukla mukherjee kahati hai ki peking uniwarsity main assistant professor or huyang ke chaatr binod singh pichley saal prashasti patr or shawl le gaye the
 However, it is not clear why he was not given the prize money
 haalanki sutara is baat kii pushti karte hai ki chini bainkon kaa form par sahi dastakhat na karnaa hi aadchan bana
 In his CASS office, Huang told India Today that he felt "quite proud" by receiving the honor
 ve bataate hai ki unhen puraskaar raashi nahin mili he
 Sitting between dozens of books of Sanskrit literature and his translation, Huayang talks about bringing Sanskrit a reputation in China
 2005 main chape mahabharat ke chah khandon ke anuwaad main unhen kareeb ek dashak laga tha or china sarkaar se uske liye puraskaar bhi mil chukaa he
 This translation has been sold out by hand and is now being brought to the next edition
 huyang kehete hai, ‘‘sanskrit bharat kii samskruti, darshan, vichaaron or granthon ko samajhane kaa sutara he
 Many of my students want to know more about Buddhism and want to study Sanskrit for it
 ’’binod singh bataate hai ki huyang kaa maamla iklauta nahin
 The biggest hitch in this is the bureaucracy
 ’’ ve bataate hai ki sanskrit kii padhai karne ko utsuk chini chaatro ko bharat main pechida aavedan prakriya se guzarana padataa he
 So many of these learn Sanskrit go to Europe
 pakistan ke peshawar main ek car main hue visphot main ek pratibandhit aatanki sanghathan ke 2 aatankiyon kii maut ho gai, jabaki 5 log ghayal ho gaye
 Explosive Power Police chief Sifwat Ghayur told reporters through the remote that the bomb was planted in a car which was being driven by Mubin Afridi, a spokesman of the banned outfit ansar-ul-islam
 afridi ke saath uskaa ek dost bhi maaraa gaya
 He said that when the car was in the Hayatabad area of peshawar, someone detonated the bomb with a remote control
 vaardaat ke peeche dushmani mumkinpulice pramukh ne kaha ki afridi kii pratibandhit lashkar-e-islam sanghathan se dushmani thi or is baat kii ashanka ko ‘andekha’ nahin kiya ja saktaa ki isi sanghathan ne afridi ko nishaanaa banaaya ho
 Ghayur said that the police have arrested 2 suspects after the attack
 police ne bataaya ki ghayalon main adhiktar vahaan se guzar rahe naagarik hai
 The car was completely destroyed in the explosion
 ramajaan ke maukey par suraksha kadighayur ne bataaya ki ravivaar se shuru hone ja rahe ramajaan maah ko dekhte hue masjidon or samvedansheel ilaakon main suraksha vyavastha majboot kar di gai he
 ansar-ul-islam and lashkar-e-islam have long been feuding to gain control over the Khabar area of peshawar
 jammu-kashmir main ab congress or neshnal conference kaa purana gathbandhan tut chukaa he
 The Congress will contest alone 87 seats in the upcoming assembly elections
 congress mahasachiv gulam bani aaazaad ne press conference karke neshnal conference se gathbandhan tuutane kaa aupchaarik elaan kiya
 He also made it clear that the party will contest all the seats alone
 pradesh ke siem umr abdulla ne twitor par is baat kii safai di ki unhone gathbandhan tuutane kaa elaan kyon nahin kiya
 He wrote, 'I told him that i will not announce it, because i do not want to appear opportunistic

 pipuls democratic party (pidipi) pehle hi vidhansabha chunaav ke liye apana najariya saaf kar chuki he
 PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti said that her party would contest the assembly elections on its own
 gauratlab he ki jammu-kashmir main dwisadaneey vyavastha he
 Members of the Legislative Assembly are directly elected by the public, while the members of the Legislative Council are elected by 87 members of the Legislative Assembly
 rajya vidhansabha kaa chah varshon kaa kaarykaal agle saal janvari main puraa ho rahaa he
 Elections are due by the end of this year
 sarkaar banane ke liye kisi ko 44 siton kii darkaar hoti he
 However, it remains to be seen how far the Congress alone can get seats in the assembly elections
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne apni kathith 'dohari naagarikta' ke mudde par loksabhaa kii ek samiti kii ore se bheje gaye notice kaa jawaab daakhil kar diya he
 In his reply, Rahul questioned the committee's decision to take cognizance of a complaint that was 'not correct'
 'subramanyam swami par nishanounhone bijepi netaa subramanyam swami ko bhi is baat kii chunauti di ki vah unka british passport number or anya sambandhit dastavej saarvajanik karen
 In response to a notice sent by the Ethics Committee headed by senior BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani, Rahul also said that the complainant had 'grossly misled' the issue
 rahul ne kii sabooton kii mangasmiti sachivalay ko 23 march ko die gaye apane jawaab main congress upaadhyaksh ne kaha, 'mujhe hairat ho rahi he ki aachaar samiti ne ek aisi shikaayat kaa sangyaan liya jo sahi nahin he
 This is an attempt to discredit me
 maine na to kabhibritish naagariktamangi he or na hi kabhi lee he
 My identity is of an Indian
 ' is maamle se kareebi taur par jude sutron ke mutabik, rahul ne maang kii he ki shikayatakarta apana aarope sabit karne ke liye saboot pesh karen or apni daleelon ke samarthan main ek halafanama daakhil kare
 'swamy clearly misled' Rahul said, 'in support of his argument, no document on which he is relying is written that i have ever declared myself a British citizen
 ' unhone kaha ki yah saaf ho chukaa he ki shikayatakarta ne 'saraasar gumraah kiya' he
 The Congress vice president said that citizenship is a fact and if he ever sought or acquired British citizenship, it would be part of the official documents of the British Home Office
 unhone kaha, 'shikaayat darj karaane se pehle strot se tathy kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa tha
 "sources quoting the reply filed by Rahul on the notice said," i request Mr
 Swamy to reveal publicly the evidence of Rahul Gandhi's alleged British passport number and related documents to prove he was a British citizen
 'rahul gandhi par aropadwani kii adhyakshata vaali aachaar samiti ne march ke duusare hafte main rahul ko notice jari kar us aarope par unka jawaab maanga tha jisamen kaha gaya tha ki congress upaadhyaksh ne britain kii ek company main nideshak kaa pad hasil karne ke liye khud ko british naagarik ghoshit kiya tha
 In the first week of January, Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan referred the complaint made by BJP MP Mahesh Giri to the Ethics Committee in the first week of January
 giri ne apni party ke sahakarmi subramanyam swami ke is aarope kii 'uchit jaanch' kaa anurodh kiya tha jisamen kaha gaya tha ki britain main ek company banane ke liye rahul ne khud ko british naagarik ghoshit kiya tha
 Swamy had also written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi last November questioning Rahul's citizenship
 teesraa saptak ke murdhanya kavi kedarnath singh nahin rahe
 He has left for Hindi literature with eight poetry collections and three criticism books

 Kedar ji's last interview, including Sahitya Akademi Award, Vyas Samman and Jnanpith, was published in India Today Literature Anniversary 2017
 yah baatcheet kala-samskruti patrkaar ajit raay ne kii thi
 Ajit Rai was with Kedarnath Singh in a journey and the conversation of both of them as if the entire history of world poetry was revealed
 us neem andheri raat main donon kavita ke ek duusare hi bhugol main pahunch gaye the
 In the same conversation, Kedarnath Singh recalled how when Nicaragua's pastor and communist poet Ernesto Kardenal wrote a poem on the suicide of Hollywood's Dreamgirl Marilyn Monroe, there was a panic, "oh God, you know who he talks to?" Wanted to do "(phir dhire se kehete hai, ''vah america raashtrapati se baat karnaa chaahati thi
 She was in love
 kitna dukhad he prem main kisi stri kaa aatmahatya karnaa!")ajit raay ne ab baatcheet ko prem par mode diya tha
 Kedarnath Singh went through a deep infinity of memory and then remembered Kardanal, "when you are not in New York, no one is in New York
" jab tum hoti ho neuyark main,to koi nahin hota neuyark main
 "such a great poet was expelled by the Communist Party because he kissed the feet of the pope while doing the duty of clergy
 baatcheet phir mahaan roosi kavi maaychovsky or stallin ke samvaad kii taraf mudati he
 Kedarnath Singh had told the whole story, a young poet read a poem against Stalin in a small unknown cafe in Moscow among four friends
 vah maaychovsky kaa shagird tha
 The next day, Stalin's phone rang at Mykowski's house
 stallin ne us yuva kavi kaa naam lekar poocha ki vah kaisaa kavi he
 Mykowski panicked fearfully that he was an ordinary poet
 stallin ne yah kehete hue phone rakh diya, ''aap apane dost ko bachaana nahin chaahate
 "mykowski's wife scolded him well
 us raat ke baad us yuva kavi kaa kuch pataa na chalaa
 That is, even a dictator like Stalin wanted to know what his level was before he killed a poet
 ho saktaa tha ki maaychovsky ke yah kehane se uski jaan batch jaati ki vah ek mahatvapurn kavi he
 "(() Ajit Rai's entire conversation with Kedarnath Singh is our significant legacy as his last interview in India Today literature annuity
 puraa saakshaatkaar padhane ke liye sahitya varshiki kii prati hasil karen
 )) *** raashtrapati pad ke liye ramnath kovind ke saamne apana ummidavaar utaarne ke liye vipaksh guuruuvaar ko baithak to kar rahaa he, lekin baithak se pehle hi kai vipakshi partiyaan yah maan rahi hai ki bijepi kaa muqabla karne ke liye apni ranneeti banane main vipaksh phir chook gaya
 Prior to the meeting, the discussion is going on strongly that the opposition can make Prevlok Sabha speaker Meera Kumar its candidate
 mira kumaar bhi ramnath kovind kii tarah dalit hai, bade kad kii netaa hai or jagjivan ram kii beti hai
 She has also been a Lok Sabha speaker
 kai vipakshi partiyon ko lagata he ki agar congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne baaki vipakshi partiyon se baatcheet kar endie se pehle hi mira kumaar ko ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya hota to endie ke upar dabaav bad jaataa
 According to Mamatasutras who did not agree on Meira Kumar's name, some leaders had discussed this with Sonia Gandhi
 sonia gandhi mira kumaar ko ummidavaar banaae jane ke paksh main bhi thim
 But he said that the Left and Mamta Banerjee are in favor of making Gopal Krishna Gandhi the opposition candidate
 isiilie mira kumaar ke naam par faisla nahin ho sakaa
 After this it was decided that the first NDA should be allowed to declare its candidate
 ab kai vipakshi partiyon ko lagata he kiramnath kovindke mukaable mira kumaar ko utarkar bhale hi dalit ke khilaaf dalit khadaa kar diya jaae, lekin dalit raajnneeti kaa sandesh dene ke hisaab se endie baaji maar chuki he
 It is already decided to win the NDA candidate according to the number force, but the Opposition also lost to the NDA symbolically
 ab haalat yah he ki vipaksh kii baithak se pehle hi unke samarthan main aane vaale dal ramnath kovind ke naam par sahamat najar aa rahe hai
 The Chief Minister of Bihar has given a big blow to the opposition by supporting Nitish Kumar Ramnath
 vot bank ke liye nitish kaa samarthan!darasal, sabhi raajnneetik dal ramnath kovind par stand lene ke maamle main apana napha-nuksaan soch rahi he
 Nitish Kumar came to Ramnath Kovindke's court because he is a Mahadalit, whose politics Nitish Kumar has been doing
 iske alaava kovind kaa bihar kaa governor hona bhi ek kaaran rahaa
 Not only this, Nitish Kumar's tension with Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal is also going on continuously
 aise main ramnath kovind ke bahaane bijepi ke kareeb jaakar nitish kumaar lalu yadav par dabaav badha rahe hai
 The confusion of maya-akhilesh is the second of the Uttar Pradesh parties
 aaj tak uttar pradesh se koi bhi vyakti raashtrapati nahin hua he
 No party of UP wants to give the message that when the person of UP came to be the President, he stuck the road in the way
 samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party kaa bhi yahi asamanjas he
 Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati is finding it difficult to oppose Ramnath Kovind because she too is a Dalit
 duusari taraf agar vipaksh ne mira kumaar ko pehle hi apana ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya hota to shaayad bispi ke liye faisla lenaa aasaan hota
 Anyway, the Samajwadi Party has only 20,000 votes and the BSP has only 6000 votes
 isliye in donon partiyon ke virodh se koi khaas fark padane vaala nahin he
 Now the situation is that before the Opposition meeting only four parties appear to be strongly in favor of contesting against Ramnath Kovind
 congress, left, trinmul congress or rashtriya janata dal ke alaava koi bhi khulkar ummidavaar utaarne ke paksh main najar nahin aa rahaa he
 The 17-year-old relationship is on the verge of rupture today
 siyasat ke sabase puraane dost ab ek-duusare par etbaar nahin kar paa rahe
 Now the relationship has become so sour that there is talk of separating the roads
 jediu ko narendra modi manjuur nahin, isliye bijepi se 'talaak' kii baaten ho rahi hai
 a final decision is likely on 15 or 16 June
 is bich puri khinchataan par adwani ne nitish kumaar or sharad yadav se phone par baat kii he
 When the phase of complaints starts in love, then understand that the time has come for divorce before Nikah
 siyaasi gathbandhan main sabase puraane maane jane vaale dost bijepi or jediu ke bich aisi talwaar khinchi he ki rishte ab tuutane kii kagaar par hai
 If a new face of BJP emerged in Goa, then JDU also fired
 jediu ke tamaam netaa ek sur main kehete hai ki ab juda rahon par chalane kaa vakt aa gaya he
 When JDU voiced 'divorce-divorce-divorce' from the BJP, the JDU president and NDA convenor acted with little restraint
 rishton kii guarantee to nahin di, par do-teen dinon tak bayanon par dhyaan naa dene par jor jarur diya
 The BJP president, who played the biggest bet in Modi's name, was asked where in the Mahabharata Lankand came from, while the party's new Raj k Nath said, 'ask Meghnad'
 bayaanbajiyon ke is daur main ab tevar donon ore ke sakht hai
 Both of BJP and also of JDU
 or vaqt bataata he ki sakht tevar se siyasat badalati kam he, bigadati zyaada he
 BJP will now realize this pain more, because the PM has to make it and for this, he is showing the same maneuver
 ab siyasat ke rangamanch par dekhnaa ye he ki talaak kii ye dhamkiyaan bas dhamkiyaan bhar hai yaa phir aane vaale dinon main koi nayaa gul bhi khilne vaala he
 Then there was the exercise of the Third Front, the intruders keep saying that the Third Front cannot run in India
 kehane vaale kehete rahen ki teesraa morcha kabhi sthaayee nahin hoga
 But whenever the power equation in the country deteriorates, turmoil in the politics of the Center and the states begins, the third front comes first in the discussion
 ek baar phir bijepi main modi raaj kaayam hone se endie kaa vajood khatre main aayaa or tisare morche kii hawa ne jor pakad lee
 As soon as Mamata Banerjee, who was leading the air of the Third Front, felt that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's colleagues were vowing to get rid of the BJP, they spread the alliance for the Third Front
 jediu ke mahasachiv kasee tyaagi kii pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee se mulaakaat bhi hui or phir elaan hua ki teesri takat banane kii baat main dam he
 After the meeting, Nitish Kumar himself called Mamata Banerjee and congratulated her for trying to give life to the Third Front
 mamata banerjee ne kabool kiya ki wo tisare morche ke liye odisha ke mukhyamantri naveen patnayak ke bhi sampark main hai
 Naveen Patnaik, however, says that it is too early to envisage a third front
 abhi apane pattey kholane ke mood main nahin patnayakanithish kii tarj par naveen patnayak ne bhi dilli main dam dikhaaya
 Vishal Swabhiman rallied to give special status to Odisha and during this time he said that now let's see how much color the air of the Third Front catches
 naveen patnayak 'wet and watch' kii niti apana rahe hai
 But the Samajwadi Party, which once betrayed Mamata Banerjee, did not delay in inviting the Third Front to Nitish Kumar
 congress-ensipi ke haath-paanv phuletisraa morcha abhi hawa main hi he, lekin congress ke paseene chhootane lage hai
 The Congress and NCP have called the Third Front a 'khayali Pulav'
 third front apane bal-boote par sarkaar nahin bana sakati
 Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar said this in a conversation with media in Sangli, Maharashtra
 pavaar ne kaha ki teesraa morcha kitni bhi koshish kare, to bhi apane boote par sarkaar nahin bana sakati
 He will have to seek the help of some national party
 pavaar ne yah bhi kaha ki UPA yaa NDA ke liye bhi pradeshik partiyon- jaise DMK, TMC ko saath liye bagaiyr sarkaar bananaa mushkil he
 The Agriculture Minister said that it is impossible to have Lok Sabha elections before 2014

 However, despite all this and despite being arrested for sexual exploitation and going to jail, the statement issued by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Institute in favor of Girish Chandra Verma has not only described him as innocent but also It has been said that this charge of rape is nothing but the conspiracy of his enemies

 Queen Victoria of Britain died on this day, 22 January 1901
 rani raaj parivaar se taalluk rakhti thim
 In this case, he was raised very strictly
 victoria ke janm ke 8 maheene baad hi pita kaa nidhan ho gaya tha
 After which his maternal uncle got his education done
 mana jaataa he ki victoria ko kisi bhi purush se ekant yani akele main milane nahin diya jaataa tha
 Even older servants could not come to them
 jitani der ve shikshakon se padhatin, unki maa yaa daima unke paas baithi rahati
 But in spite of such strictness, at the end of the 19th century, a reality was revealed to the world, which an ordinary British citizen was not ready to digest
 jaane kya thi baatcharon taraf charchaa fail gai thi ki rani kaa pyaar ho gaya he
 If she is the queen of Britain, then she must have fallen in love with a prince
 lekin jab baat logon ke saamne ai to sabhi ke hosh ud gaye
 The first Queen of Britain, Victoria, fell in love not with a king but with a modest servant
 jo bhartiya tha
 It was Abdul Karim, a slim man who made Queen Victoria her lover
 duniya kii pehali maharani thim victoria, akele main nahin mil sakate the purushakaise shuru hui prem kathybdul kareem 24 saal ke the jab ve 1887 main agra se england gaye the
 He was sent to Queen Victoria as a gift from India
 vah ek saal ke bheetar hi is noujvaan ko maharani ke darbar main shikshak kaa darja de diya gaya tha or unhen nirdesh diya gaya ki wo maharani ko hindi or urdu sikhaaen
 Abdul and Victoria's love affair was revealed when Abdul's diary was revealed
 jisase pataa chalaa ki bharat se maharani kaa sevak banaakar britain gaye abdul kareem ko kis tarah maharani dil de baithi hai
 The story of Victoria and Abdul is exactly like it happens in films
 ek amir gharaane kii ladki or garib ladke ke bich pyaar hona
 Punyathithi: Know why Devendranath says Tagore was very well known for his greatness, let Abdul Karim behave in such a tall stature and beautiful personality that the queen not only impressed him but came closer to him
 baad main abdul kareem ke naam ke aage munshi jud gaya
 He became the Queen's Secretary of India
 jab rani ko abdul se prem hua unki umr 60 varsh thi
 NSA Ajit Dovalmaharani, who changed 'religion' for seven years in PAK, often wrote his heart in letters to him
 kabhi-kabhi to maharani apane patron main chumban ke pratik bhi banaati thi, jo us samay main behad asaadhaaran baat thi
 The relationship between the two was very emotional which can be described at different levels
 maharani kii maut ke baad san 1901 main king edward abdul kareem ko waapas bharat bhej diya
 Not only this, the correspondence between Karim and the Queen was ordered to be confiscated immediately and destroyed
 kareem maharani ke saath kareeb 15 saal rahe
 After his return home, he lived alone in Agra
 agra main unhone jahaan apane aakhri saal bitaye, vah sampattimaharani ne unhen di thi
 When Abdul died in 1909, he was just 46 years old

 However, by the end of the Lok Sabha elections, there will be a majority in the Rajya Sabha and after that it will be easy for the Modi government to pursue its legislative agenda

 Will be brought mukhyamantri siddharmaiya old mysore main apni chamundeshwari vidhansabha seat nikaal sakate hai lekin uttar karnataka kii badami seat par bijepi ke adivasee netaa shriramulu se unhen karaari takkar mil rahi he
 An in-depth analysis of data from India today-axis My India exit poll shows that Sriramulu, a very close friend of the Mining King Reddy brothers, has left no stone unturned to relieve Chief Minister Siddaramaiah's sweat on the Badami seat
 agsit pole data ke vishleshan se ye dekhnaa dilachasp he ki reddy bhai khud jin siton se lade vahaan utana acha nahin kar paae jitani ki bijepi ne unase ummid kii thi
 The exit poll estimates that g Somashekhar Reddy, elder brother of Gali Janardhana Reddy, is in a tough fight with Congress candidate Anil Lad in Bellary city
 vahiin agsit pole bellari gramin seat par shriramulu ke kareebi rishtedaar sannaa fakirappa ko congress ke bi nagendra se pichhadta dikhaaya gaya he
 Nagendra is also a big name in the field of mining
 agsit pole ke mutabik bellari jile kii hi compali seat par shriramulu ke bhattije tii ech suresh babu kii bhi congress ummidavaar je en ganesh ke saamne haalat khasta he
 If people close to the Reddy brothers have to fight hard to win their seats, this will be a big message for the BJP from the voters of Karnataka
 bijepi ne bellari ke kukhyat reddy bhaaiyon par bada daanv lagaate hue unke kunbe or karibiyon ko aath tikat isliye die the ki aisa karne se hyderabad karnataka or central karnataka main party kii sambhaavnaaen behatar hongi
 Altogether, the BJP made the Reddy brothers in charge of 22 seats in three districts like Bellary, Raichur and Chitradurga
 exis maay india ne karnataka kii un sabhi 222 seat par apane surveykshakon ko bheja tha jahaan 12 may, shanivaar ko matdaan hua
 a hard and thorny seat is considered to be the seat where the difference of votes between the winner and the second closest candidate is less than 2%
 karnataka ke anya viipi ummidavaaron kii baat kii jaae to mukhyamantri pad ke liye bijepi kaa cheharaa bies yediurppa ko agsit pole data ke mutabik apane garh shikarpura main badhat hasil he
 Similarly, Janata Dal Secular (JDS) state president HD Kumaraswamy is in a comfortable position in his seat Ramanagaram
 kaante ke mukaable vaali 36 siton ke paas he kunjimangalvaar ko matganana vaale din karnataka ke kile kaa sara daaromadar un 36 siton par tikaa he jahaan exis maay india agsit pole ne bahut zyada kaante kii takkar dikhaai he
 These seats are spread across different regions of Karnataka
 bombai karnataka main 10 seat par talwaar kii dhar par chalane vaala muqabla he
 Similarly, in Karnataka Karnataka, it is expected to contest 8 seats in Central Karnataka and 5 seats in Coasters Karnataka, 4-4 seats in Bangalore and Old Mysore
 agar in kaante kii takkar vaali 36 siton ko alag kar diya jaae to agsit pole data ke mutabik congress 89, bijepi 73 or JDS 24 seat par jeet hasil karti najar aa rahi he
 If the Congress has to win a majority on its own, it will have to win most of these 36 contested seats
 vahiin bijepi ko vishwaas he ki kaante kii takkar vaali siton main party kaa behatar santhnik kaushal aakhirkaar congress par baari padegaa
 BJP national president Amit Shah has calculated that the cadre of the party and the Sangh did a great job in bringing the BJP voters out of the house to the polling booth
 congress ke saath garib, BJP amiron kii pasandkarnatakake votaron ko aamadani ke hisaab se baanta jaae to exis agsit pole data ke adhyayan se ye saaf he ki congress kii lokapriyata karnataka ke nimna aay varg main sabase zyada he
 As the income horizon increases, that is, in the higher income groups, the popularity graph of the Congress decreases
 garibi rekha se neeche rahane vaale yani BPL pariwaron main congress kaa vot share 40% he
 Apart from this, Congress has 33% support among people whose income is between Rs 11000-2 xxrep 4 0 
 jin logon kii aay 31,000 rupye se zyaada he, unamem mahaj 20% vot share hi congress ke paas he
 On the other hand, BJP has a large vote share of 54% of the rich voters of Karnataka
 vahiin BPL pariwaron main mahaj 34% voter hi bijepi ke saath khadey najar aate hai
 While BJP national president Amit Shah is trying to brand the party as a party of the poor, his efforts may not seem to be effective in the Karnataka elections
 ashikshiton kaa haath congress ke saath, shikshiton kaa bharosa BJP parashiksha ke pyramid se judekarnatakake agsit pole data ko dekha jaae to voter jitna adhik shikshit he uskaa voting kaa jhukaav utana hi zyada bijepi kii ore he
 The Congress has a 47% vote share among the illiterate voters of Karnataka
 dasvin paas votaron main 36% or graduate votaron main 33% congress ke saath hai
 BJP, on the other hand, has 41% vote share among graduate voters, 37% among tenth passers and 29% among uneducated voters
 karnataka ke jaateey chakravyuuh ko bhedanakarnataka main 76 seat aisi hai jahaan lingayat samudaay ko nirnaayak sthiti main mana jaataa he
 The Congress won 48 of these seats in the 2013 assembly elections
 lekin agsit pole ke mutabik is baar congress ke liye ye aankada ghatakar 33 seat par aane kaa anumaan he
 In the 2013 Karnataka assembly elections, BS Yeddyurappa had hurt bjp's prospects by forming his own party Karnataka Janata Paksha (KJP)
 is baar lingayat prabhaav vaali siton main bijepi kii seat sankhya 18 se badhkar 40 tak pahunchane kii ummid he
 There are 13 seats in Karnataka with Muslim community influence
 yahaan congress kii seat sankhya 8 se badhkar 11 ho sakati he
 At the same time, the JDS figure on such seats can come down from 3 to 1
 karnataka main vokkaligga samudaay kii bahulata vaali 54 seat hai
 The number of Congress and JDS on these seats may remain the same as it was in the 2013 assembly election results
 old mysore main bijepi 2013 ke mukaable is baar apana pradarshan kuch sudhaarti najar aa rahi he
 Here BJP is projected to get 11 seats in Vokkaligga belt
 2013 vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko yahaan 8 seat se hi santosh karnaa padaa tha

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne somvaar ko maharashtra ke wardha main jansabha ko sambodhit kiya or hindu aatankwaad ke masale par congress par nishaanaa saadhaa
 It is clear that before the election, the BJP has once again played the Hindutva card, which it can redeem in the coming days
 narendra modi isse pehle 2014 chunaav ke dauraan bhi wardha aae the, tab or ab ke bhaashan main kaaphi antar dikhaai padataa he

 In the speech, when and on whom? In his 32-minute speech, the Prime Minister spoke on the issue of Hindu for a total of 6 minutes
 unhone rahul gandhi ko bhi unke kerala kii vynad seat se bina naam liye nishane par liya, jab unhone kaha ki kuch log dar ke kaaran aisi seat se chunaav lard rahe hai jahaan par hindu alpsankhyak hai
 After this, the Prime Minister took a total of 5 minutes against Nationalist Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar
 unhone sharad pavaar kii raajnneeti, congress ke saath or parivaar main chal rahi kalah ke muddon par nishaanaa saadhaa
 If he listened to the entire speech of the PM, he spoke on the issue of terrorism, airstrike, nationalism and Pakistan for more than half the time
 gaur karne vaali baat ye bhi he ki piem ne apane bhaashan main sabase kam samay apni sarkaar kii uplabdhiyaan ginane or wardha se jude muddon par baat karne par bitaayaa
 Farmer suicides have been a major issue in this region of Maharashtra, according to a figure, around 14,000 thousand farmers have committed suicide in the region so far
 piem ne apane bhaashan ke sirf 3 minute kisaan, unki sarkaar ke dwaara kisaanon ke liye kiye gaye kaam par baat kii
 The Prime Minister's speech began with the A-SAT launch and then the entire speech focused on the issue of Hindutva
 2014 ke bhaashan main kya tha khaas?pichley loksabhaa chunaav main jab narendra modi pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar the tab bhi unhone wardha main sabha kii thi or unka wo bhaashan ab ke bhaashan se kaaphi alag tha
 In a 32-minute speech given on 20 March 2014, he spoke on the issue of farmers for 18 minutes and criticized the then UPA government
 kisaanon ke mudde par raajnneeti kii baat ho, aatmahatya kaa mudda yaa phir gujarat kaa udhaaharan dene kii piem ne kisaanon ke mudde par bharpoor baat kii thi
 Apart from this, the PM on Jawans and terrorism was two and a half minutes, mostly OROP

 Demand and general issues of votes - 2 minutes apni kitaab kii vajah se navazuddin siddiki lagaataar vivaadon main funsate ja rahe hai
 Now a theater artiste who has worked with him has called him a liar as a human being
 shuukravaar ko ek lambii fasebuk post likhakar theatre artist ne kaha - navazuddin tumhen aaj bhi auraton kii izzat kerani nahin aati
 This artist is none other than Sunita Rajwar
 unhone navaj ke saath kaam kiya he
 In his book An Ordinary Life: a Memoir, Nawaz wrote to Sunita stating that he had abandoned her because of poverty
 khabaron kii maane to kitaab ke content se naaraaz sunita navaj ke khilaaf cese karne ke bare main soch rahi hai
 4 Disclosures: Aamir Khannawaz, who did not recognize Nawaz who worked together 18 years ago, has revealed many of his affairs in his book
 isamen unke saath kaam karne vaali ko-actress se hotel kii vetres tak shaamil hai
 Nawaz had named Sunita Rajwar, revealing the first love
 unhone daawa kiya ki berogari kii vajah se jab unka brallep hua, us vakt wo suicide tak kii sochane lage the
 Nawaz has made sensational revelations related to the relationship with Miss Lovely co-actress Niharika Singh
 sunita kii tarah niharika ne bhi navaj kii baton ko ashleel qaraar diya or ise kitaab bechney kaa sasta hathkandaa kaha
 Sunita alleged in her Facebook post that Nawaz has lied to her about many lies
 navaj kii chhodane kii asli vajah vah nahin thi, jo unhone bataai
 It was not like that at all
 aisi thi navaj kii miss lavali kii pehali film, 157 Scenes par aapattipadhen, post main kya likhaa-kehete hai naseeb vakt badal saktaa he, insaan kii fitrat nahin
 After reading Nawaz's book, he felt like this and suddenly remembered a lion of 'mailaram Wafa', "once he saw me smiling, such a reality is the rest of the stories"
 kyonki is biography main kaaphi had tak sirf chapai he, sachai nahin, kai baaten nawaz ne apane man se, apane hisaab se or apane haq main likhi hai, chit bhi meri pat bhi meri tips
 He has also called himself evil in a very beautiful way and has equally blamed all the evil of his evil on women
 khaskar mujh par, kyonki unki maane to mere baad unka pyaar se or auraton se vishwaas hi uth gaya tha or unke saare imotions RIP yani rest in pis ho gayi the
 However, as far as i am concerned in his biography, the result of his lies starts from where my mention, ie from the first two lines of the beginning, where Nawaz is saying that he never met me in NSD
 NSD main wo mere ek saal senior the to zaahir he mulaakaat to hoti hogi
 Yes, there was nothing between us at that time, but to say that never met, it seems a bit strange
 navaj kii jindagi kaa raaj- garlfriend kii vajah se karnaa chaahate the suicidaphir unhone kaha ki main unke ghar kii deevaaron main art-work karti thi, hamaare naam ukera karti thi, dil banaaya karti thi, jinke bich se hokar kabhi-kabhi tir bhi guzara karata tha
 After reading this it felt as if i did not go to meet him, but to take his Arts and Crafts class
 had to tab ho gai jab unhone romantic bollywood movie style main likh diya ki hamaare brake-ap ke baad unhone white paint kii baaltee lee or brush se mere art-work ko diwaar se or mujhe dil se mitaate gaye
 Now the question arises that when i had never made any art work, then whose art work are they talking about, let these small things be ignored, but the real game, they have Played where our break-up came from
 nawaz hameshaa se Sympathy seeker rahe hai, wo koi asi chiz nahi chhodte jahaan se sahanubhooti batori ja sakati ho, kabhi apane rang rup ko lekar, kabhi garibi ko lekar, kabhi ye kahkar kii wo wochaman kii naukari kar chuke hai, jab kii sach to ye he ki us vakt unka fimali becoground mere fimali becoground se acha tha
 Seeing such an inscrutable success makes one feel a bit scared of success sometimes
 kair, nawaz kaa kahana he ki wo garib the or stregalar the isaliye maine unhen chhod diya
 So what was I, Nawaz, i was poorer than you, you were staying at least in your house, i was staying in a friend's house and doing it
 filmon ke liye itani fees lete hai navaj, bataaya actress se padaa tha pehla thappadaye sirf tum acchhee tarah jaanate ho ki hamaara rishta ek play se shuru hokar us play ke maatr teen sho se pehle khatm ho chukaa tha, kyonki tumhaari sachai mere saamne aa chuki thi
 i had stopped taking your phone, because it was disgusting to think about you, what would you talk to me
 maine ye kabhi nahin kaha ki tum apane kariyar par focus karo or main apane
 Now that you have already crossed all limits, also know why i left you, i left you because you used to share all personal things with our common friends while making fun of our relationship
 tab mujhe pataa chalaa ki tum aurat or pyaar ke bare main kya soch rakhte ho
 The second big lie that forced me to write this post is that after your success i started telling people that you and i once had a deep relationship
 naa maine tab kisi ko kuch bolaa tha or naa aaj tak kisi ko kuch bataaya
 Then why such a big lie, Nawaz, if you become very truthful, you would also print the name of those people in your biography with whom i used to tell you about our relationship after your success
 tumne likhaa he ki main tumhaara pehla pyaar thi, sookhe main pehali barish kii tarah, agar ye pehla pyaar tha to bhagwaan kare kisi ko esa pehla pyaar na mili
 Today the name is yours, you are doing a good job, so i did not say then, but now i will definitely say focus on your career
 maine tumhen tumhaari garibi kii vajah se nahin tumhaari garib soch kii vajah se choda tha
 You proved with your biography that the Nawaz i knew today is much poorer than that
 naa tumhen tab auraton kii izzat kerani aati thi or naa hi ab sikh paae ho
 All i can say on your situation is, "go, you are capable of complaining, now you are much smaller than my complaint"
 
 And yes, i am not a mountain, but a mountain

 adarsh awaas ghotaalaa maamle main maharashtra ke do purv mukhyamantriyon ne ek duusare par us samay doshaaropan kiya jab ashok chavaan ne kaha ki is bhukhand kii manjuuri vilasarav deshmukh ne di thi or isamen unki koi bhoomika nahin thi
 In an affidavit submitted to the Commission investigating the alleged irregularities in the case, Chavan also said that he did not make any recommendations for the inclusion of civilians in the society created for armed personnel in the Colaba area

 chavaan ne deshmukh kaa naam liye bina kaha ki pune, mumbai or upnagaron main 25 lakh rupee se adhik raashi vaale bhukhand ke aavanton ke liye mukhyamantri ko faisla karnaa hota he
 Deshmukh, who submitted an affidavit before the Adarsh commission on June 17, blamed the Revenue Department and the Collector of Mumbai for the allocation of land, saying that he acted on the proposal which was sent to him for the allotment of land for the Adarsh society
 chavaan ne aaropon kaa jawaab dete hue apane aath prishthon ke halafname main kaha tha, ‘meraa yah suzav dene kaa koi sawaal hi nahin uthta ki sosayadi main asainya sadasyon ko bhi shaamil kiya janaa chahie or aisi koi bhi baat ki is maamle par mere saath vichaar vimarsh kiya gaya tha yaa maine koi suzav yaa nirdesh diya tha yaa is sambandh main maine koi faisla kiya tha, galat he or main isse inkaar karata hum
 Reacting to Chavan's affidavit, Deshmukh said, "now it is for the judicial commission to decide who is right and who is wrong
" sabko apana mat pesh karne kaa adhikaar he
 Deshmukh had earlier alleged that Chavan, the then revenue minister, had asked the housing society to change its rules and also include civilian members in it

Because Sadhvi, who leads Hinduism, is talking of boycotting her and her films, and on the other hand, hardline Muslims leading Islamism have been talking of getting these Khans out of Islam already

 We cannot expect more from him

 We work only for the praise of the audience

 He later appeared in 'kidnap', 'luck', 'I Hate Love Story', 'delhi Belly', 'mere Brother Ki Dulhan' and more recently 'matru Ki Bijli Ka Mandola'

 ' imran jald hi film 'vans apon e time in mumbai 2' main ek mahatvapurn bhoomika main najar aaenge

 Former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has fiercely spewed venom against India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 ek intervyuu main musharraf ne kaha he ki bharat ke khilaaf ladane ke liye paak sena ke alaava lakhon ladaake taiyaar hai
 Our army is capable of capturing India from both sides in Kashmir
 agar bharat hamaare upar pathar phenkata hai to pakistan ko bharat par eent phenkna chahie
 Pervez Musharraf, then Kashmir's Yadmusharraf, blamed India for ceasefire violations
 musharraf ne piem modi par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa he or kaha he ki modi muslim virdohi or pakistan virdohi hai
 In this interview, Musharraf said, "pakistan should give a befitting reply to the ceasefire violation by India
" bharat vaale kashmir main kuch kar rahe hai
 Our army can control India from both sides
 ham muslim hai, agar unhone hamaare ek gaal par chaanta maaraa to ham doosraa gaal aage nahin badhayenge
 'they said,' If India throws stones at us, we should throw bricks at them
 bharat ko jawaab dene ke liye hamaare paas sena ke alaava bhi kai strot hai
 Even inside Kashmir, many people are against India, just to provoke them
 iske alaava pakistan se ek lakh log bharat ke khilaaf ladane ko taiyaar hai
 In such a situation, India should not take Pakistan lightly
 ' People with excessive sugary foods may have an increased risk of disease called Alzheimer's

 What Kalpana has shown while handling herself in difficult times is not a matter of everyone
 khud kii hi shaadi ke dauraan hue sadak haadase main bhai samet 15 parijan kii maut har kisi ko hilaa kar rakh detii he
 But she made history by building toilets as she showed her courage and became a brand ambassador
 iske saath hi usepiem modise milane kaa bhi mauka milegaa
 This was a complete affair that on May 5, his family went to Nagla Lal Singh village of Etah with Kalpana Lagun
 jab uske parivaar vaale vahaan se waapas laut rahe the to sadak haadase main bhai samet 15 parijano kii maut ho gai
 She was married on 9 May in a hot environment and Kalpana came to her in-laws Nagla Lal Singh
 itani badi ghatana ke baad khud ko sabhanlate hue jo usne kar dikhaaya wo tarif ke kaabil he
 After coming there, she saw that her in-laws did not have toilets, so she became depressed by this, but she did not lose courage
 shaadi ke agle din dm amit kishor ne haal chaal poochne ke liye use phone kiya to usne sasuraal main shauchalay naa hone kii baat bataai
 After that DM Amit Kishore reached Nagla Lal Singh and helped him to make the showroom

 He then helped her build the toilet

 chah farvari kii shaam thik chah baje jab punjab kor group ke 17 netaa lutiyans dilli ke 2, krishna menon maarg vaale bangale main bulaae gaye to alaakaman ke saath hone vaali is baithak kaa ekmaatr agenda tha—agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main shiromani akali dal se gathbandhan ko tod akele laden yaa yathasthiti barkaraar rakhen
 National President Amit Shah remained silent in the meeting, but Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley asked four questions - what is the political situation? How much will the BJP gain if they contest alone? What will be the situation if we fight in alliance? In a meeting that lasted about two and a half hours, the state unit said in unison: In the current political situation, the BJP does not benefit from an alliance with the Akalis
 lekin is baithak ke teen din baad jab akali netaa or punjab ke upmukhyamantri sukhbir singh badal shah or jetali se mili to bijepi ke tevar thande pad gaye
 According to sources, Shah assured Badal that the alliance would continue
 iske baad badal ne saarvajanik taur par elaan kar diya, ''akali-bijepi gathbandhan sthaayee he jo nahin tut saktaa
 We will work on a strategy to win elections jointly
 '' is faisle se niraash bijepi ke ek varisht netaa yaad dilaate hai, ''chaar maheene pehle (11 aktubar ko) jab pradhanmantri narendra modi ne chandigarh main yojit ek kaarykram main manch par maujuud punjab ke mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal ko bharat kaa nelson mandela bataaya tha, usee vakt saaf ho gaya tha ki kaaryakartaaon kii apeksha kaa daman hone vaala he
 "though no formal announcement has been made by the BJP about the future of the alliance, but the BJP is well aware of its strength in Punjab
" pradhanmantri modi or jetali kii punjab main nijee ruchi he
 Modi, as general secretary of the organization, has taken charge of the state and knows the fertility of the political land of the state from the BJP point of view, while the Jaitley Modi wave, considered the party's best strategist, also contested the Amritsar Lok Sabha seat with more than one lakh votes
 Are defeated
 gathbandhan ke masale par hui baithak ke bare main punjab bijepi ke adhyaksh camel sharma kehete hai, ''gathbandhan or rajnatik paridrishy ke bare main rajya ikai se baithak main charchaa hui
 "while the state BJP in-charge and national vice-president Prabhat Jha says," The leaders have put their point before the high command and now the high command has to decide
 ''gathbandhan bani majaburipunjab kii rajnatik paristhiti kii aupchaarik samiksha bhale shah ne kii, lekin pradhanmantri modi khud soobe ke halaat ko lekar itane chintit hai ki unhone kendriya grih rajyamantri kiren rigiju ko punjab bheja or sansadeey kshetravaar report maangi
 Rijiju went to Punjab on 31 January and 1 February and met the workers of every field and took feedback
 sutron ke mutabik, rigiju ke saath baithak main bijepi ke sthaneey netaaon ne akali sarkaar ke kaam karne ke tareekon par naaraazgi jataai to maahaul ko arajak bataaya
 The pain of the BJP leaders was about second-rate behavior despite being in the government
 is report ke baad hi pradhanmantri ne samiksha baithak bulaane ke nirdesh die
 The BJP argues that although the alliance with the Akalis is going to be politically damaging in today's situation, it is going to benefit strategically
 punjab simavarti rajya he jiskaa samrik mahatv he or gathbandhan tuutata he to ugravad kii aag main jhulas chuke is soobe main raajnneeti ke alaava bhi anya parinaam dekhne ko mil sakate hai
 BJP strategists link this argument to the incident of October 2015, when the stolen pages of the Guru Granth Sahib were found scattered in several areas, which provoked Sikh society and created tension in the state
 pathankot or gurdaspur main hue aatanki hamale ko bhi usee se jodate hue ek bijepi netaa kehete hai, ''bijepi rashtriya party he or philhal centre main satta main he, isliye khaas taur par punjab ke maamle main raajnneeti se pehle desh hit he
 In the equation, the BJP represents the urban Hindus of the Sikh community in the Akali Dal villages, so this alliance gives the message of unity and brotherhood
 '' in daleelon ke alaava bhi bijepi ke ek netaa kaa kahana he ki ab gathbandhan todgaye se party ko koi phayda nahin milane vaala kyonki vah bhi sava nau saal se satta main bhagidaar he or satta virdohi lahar se batch nahin sakati
 bjp's pressure strategy to maintain the alliance in the country interest cannot come in a meeting of just two and a half hours
 yah sthiti bijepi netritv ke saamne pehle se hi thi
 But for the first time in the neighboring state of Haryana with the Center, the BJP, which won the fort for the first time and broke the 25-year-old alliance in Maharashtra, got so strong that it made a strategy to weigh the alliance again in Punjab
 bijepi ke ek vyathit netaa kaa kahana he, ''rajya main hamaari hissedari kam he
 a mere 20 per cent stake cannot be called an alliance
 haryana vidhansabha chunaav main akali dal kii ore se bijepi ke virdohi ieneldi ko samarthan dene ke baavjood vahaan party bahumat ke saath satta main pahunchi
 "actually, the BJP high command's strategy was to make public the anger against the alliance, so the leaders of the state unit were never stopped from criticizing the Akali Dal
" bijepi kii ranneeti thi ki akali dal par dabaav banaakar siton kii sankhya badhaai jaae
 The BJP contests 23 seats out of the total 117 seats in the assembly
 party ke ek ranneetikaar kaa kahana he ki gathbandhan ko tarksangat banane ke liye bijepi ko kam se kam 40 siten milani chahie jin par vah kabhi na kabhi chunaav lard chuki he
 However, it is clear from Akali Dal's stance that the number of seats in BJP is not going to increase, but there can be a change of seats
 kamjor sanghathan or antarkalahasthaneey kaaryakartaaon kii upeksha kar gathbandhan main bane rahane kii vajah bijepi kii santhnik shakti bhi he
 The alliance of the BJP and the Akali Dal dates back to 1997, whose foundation was laid when the central government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 1996 was gathering a majority figure
 us vakt akali dal or bispi kaa gathbandhan tha, lekin akali dal ne bina shart bijepi ko samarthan diya
 The then BJP in-charge Madan Lal Khurana laid the foundation of this alliance
 us samay se bijepi 23 seat par hi ladati aa rahi he
 The party's influence is limited to urban Hindu areas
 itane lambey samay se satta main bhagidaar hone ke baavjood bijepi sabhi 117 vidhansabha kshetro main apana majboot aadhaar khadaa nahin kar pai he
 Wherever BJP has been contesting elections, the number of its booth workers is between 10 and 15, while in weak areas the number is limited to 4-5
 bijepi kaa vidhansabha main sarvshereshth pradarshan 2007 main tha jab use 23 main 19 siten mili thi
 But the harsh attitude of Navjot Singh Sidhu, who was MP for Amritsar Lok Sabha seat for three terms, is making it difficult for the party
 siddhu lambey samay se akali dal se gathbandhan todgaye kii maang kar rahe hai
 But Sidhu did not reach the final meeting on this issue
 ab unke aap main jane kii atakalein lag rahi hai
 On the other hand, there is a tussle over the state president
 maujuuda adhyaksh camel sharma duusare kaarykaal kii koshish main lage hai, lekin haal hi main unke purv nijee sahaayak jimmy sandhu ke drug taskaron se kathith sambandhon ko lekar vivaad hua tha
 The NDA, which performed well across the country during the Familyism and aap-congress Factor Lok Sabha elections, fell behind in Punjab while for the first time, the AAP won only four seats in Punjab from across the country
 use bijepi se teen guna or akali dal se mahaj do fisadi kam vot mili
 BJP leaders believe that the way AAP gets votes in all circles, the atmosphere can be gauged against the Akali government
 sarkaar main jis tarah parivaarwaad or bijness main akali dal kaa varchasv badha he, use aap or congress ne bada mudda bana rakhaa he
 Increasing smuggling of drugs, corruption are some of the issues which are against the current government
 haalanki bijepi kaa kahana he ki satta virdohi vot jab vipakshi dhadon main bantega to uskaa phayda akali-bijepi ko milegaa
 Says a leader, "manpreet Badal, after separating from the Badal family in the last election, contested the People's Party of Punjab and got 5 percent votes and the Prakash Singh Badal government returned to power
 '' haalanki chunavi mudde ke taur par paksh main ginane ke liye bijepi-akali ke paas kuch lok-lubhaavan yojanaayen or krishi ke liye 100 fisadi bijli sabsidi he
 It is obvious that the BJP has suffered from the possible consequences in Punjab, but it has realized so much that it will be able to fight alone in the state on its own

 supreme court ne 30 hajaar se zyada niveshkon ke jamaa kiye 2000 karod se zyada rupee lautaane ke liye pehle 550 karod rupee jamaa karaane kii shart rakhi thi
 The court has now extended the management of Jaypee Group till January 25 to pay the last installment of this condition

 That is, by October 27, it was a condition of depositing this amount in the registry of the Supreme Court
 jepi group ke kaaphi minnaton ke baad court ne pehle hajaar karod rupee jamaa karne kii shart rakhi
 On this too, the Jaypee Group kept stating its compulsions, saying that it would pay by selling assets
 par court kaa kahana tha ki sampattiyaan bechakar ye rupee niveshkon ko hi diye jaaenge isaki kya guarantee he
 Therefore, there was also a ban on selling any property or transferring it on lease until the amount was paid
 phir baat uthi saat sau karod jamaa karne kii shart par, lekin aakhirkaar kam se kam saadhe paanch sau karod rupee jamaa karaane ko kaha tha
 On less than this, the Supreme Court was not ready to take any kind of defamation
 supreme court ne kai baar jepi associats ke prabandhakon or nideshkon ko court main talab kiya tha
 The court had clearly stated that either investors should be given flats or they should be refunded at the rate of 14% interest on their deposits
 jepi associats ne baar-baar kaha ki unako 205 kilometre lambey chah len vaale yamuna express ve ke aasapaas kii sampatti lij par dene kii chhot di jaae to usee rakam se wo niveshkon ko bhugtan kar denge
 Apart from this, he has deposits of Rs 593 crore in ICICI Bank, but the court was not satisfied with any of jp's proposals, as all those offers were poor in the eyes of the court
 court ke sakht ravaiye ke baad jepi associats ne ab tak 425 karod rupee to supreme court kii registry main jamaa kar diye, baaki kii rakam ke liye mohalat mil gai
 On the other hand, the court has also assured all investors to keep their interests safe and protected
