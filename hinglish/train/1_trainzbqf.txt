 The demand for wireless headphones is increasing in the Indian market
 log ab vird headfones kii tulana main wireles headphone lenaa zyada pasand kar rahe hai
 But it is not easy to get a wireless headphone with good sound quality in the budget
 is bich bazaar main popular audio brands Skullcandy ne apane Jib+ wireles headphone ko haal hi main launch kiya tha
 The company has priced it at Rs 2,499
 haalanki abhi Amazon par isaki bikri 2,070 rupee main ho rahi he
 We have used this headphone for a long time and now we are going to tell you its review
 dizin or bild quality:ye headphone puri tarah se rabar kaa bana hua he
 Its neck band is a bit wide
 lekin iskaa overol strecchar duusare neckband kii tulana main kaaphi alag he
 Its buttoned part is plastic
 baaki yearbads ko simple rakhaa gaya he
 Here is the external flap of the extra grip
 isse grip to thik baith jaati he, lekin yearbads behatar tareeke kaanon ke andar nahin ja pate
 This affects the sound quality
 aise main behatar sound quality ke liye meri taraf se suzav he ki is flap ko hataa de
 Overall, its look is not impressive
 aap ise kairi karne main kaaphi pareshaan honge, kyonki iskaa nackband vaala part bhi sidhe vir jaisaa he, aise main edjastment main kaaphi pareshaani hoti he
 In addition, the wire is very long and magnets are not provided to connect the earbuds
 magnet nahin hone kii vajah se yearbads alag-alag rahete hai or inhen handle karnaa thodaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 Since there is no magnet, the magnets allow only the matter of the switch
 haalanki ek acchhee baat ye he ki ye nek main kairi karne ke liye heavi nahin he
 Talking about the buttons, it has been in-line in the left side wire itself
 yahaan teen buttens die gaye hai
 In addition to two volume rockers, there is a multi button in the middle
 ise teen second tak dabaakar rakhane se ye on / of hota he
 Also, multi-button calls can be received and cut
 vahiin on karne ke saath hi 5 second tak dabaakar rakhane se ye bluetooth peyaring ke liye ready hota he
 Here LED is given which starts blinking
 saath hi yahaan charging ke liye yahaan micro USB port diya gaya he
 Bluetooth version 5 in this headphone
 0 kaa upyog kiya gaya he
 In such a situation, fast connectivity is available here
 iske alaava yahaan multi batan se virtual assistant ko bhi actevet kiya ja saktaa he
 Talking about the volume rockers, the + sine is the volume up and - the sine is the volume down and holding them for 2 seconds allows the track to be preceded and next
 parformens:ham yahaan parformens main audio output, colling or bydaree kii baat karenge
 First of all, let's talk about the audio output, so let us tell you here that the company has used 9mm drivers
 overol audio quality kaaphi balanced he
 We have used classical, psychedelic rock, jazz, rock, dubstep, EDM, BDM, metal, trance and folk with many genres and all the genres are quite good
 High, Mids or Lows saare nots clear hai
 However the base has a slight punch miss and the sub base could have been a bit better
 phir bhi keemat ke lihaaj se ise najar andaaj kiya ja saktaa he
 Overall tuning is quite good
 bydaree kii baat karen to company ne 6 ghante kaa daawa kiya he or company kaa daawa yahaan sahi thahartaa he
 Talking about microphone, it is also better for calling
 lekin bheedbhad vaali jagahon par ise yuj karne main aap pareshaan ho sakate hai, kyonki yahaan pasive nois canselation bhi nahin he
 Verdict: Now the question is, should you buy it? So the answer is that if you want better audio quality in the budget then you can invest money in it
 baaki luk or dizin ke maamle main ye thodaa feekaa he
 Buying it for sports activity might not be good either

 sapa main mache ghamaasan ke bich amar singh ne aaj lakhanu main kaha ki main ek saath paanch vichaardhaaraon ke saath nahin hum
 He said that i am not used to doing politics through the thief door
 haalanki iske saath hi joda ki raajnneeti kaaphi krur or nirmam hai
 Responding to the issue of my business in UP, i said that i did not do a money business there
 iske saath hi kaha ki main akhilesh kii unnati main baadhak nahin hum
 i bless them to be famous
 main lakhanu isliye hi aayaa hum ki pita-putr main mail ho
 The comments sapa main takhtapalat hone or akhilesh kheme ke paksh main sankhya bal hone par bolte hue amar singh ne kaha ki mulaayam be-haisiyat hai, ye sunne kii hamaari kshamta nahin he
 Also said that we do not understand the status of anyone with the strength of numbers
 haisiyat vyaktitv se banati he
 However, he also added to the question of how Shivpal's tainted partner has now become white along with Akhilesh
 ullekhneey he ki sapa main mache ghamaasan ke bich ek janvari ko sapa ke ek dhade ne party se baghawat karte hue ek akhilesh yadav ko party kaa rashtriya adhyaksh chun liya or amar singh ko party se baahar nikaal diya gaya
 With the ouster of Mulayam Singh from the national president, Shivpal Yadav's post of party state president was also taken away
 akhilesh khemaa party or pita-putr main jhagade kii jad bhi amar singh ko tehraata he
 Speaking on the coup in SP and the strength of the Akhilesh camp in favor, Amar Singh said that Mulayam is unconcerned, it is not our ability to listen
 saath hi kaha ki sankhyabal se kisi kii haisiyat ham nahin samajhate
 Status is made up of personality
 haalanki unhone sawalia lahaze main yah bhi joda ki shivpal ke daagi saathi ab akhilesh ke saath milakar safed kaise ho gaye hai
 It is worth mentioning that on 1 January, a faction of the SP rebelled from the party, choosing Akhilesh Yadav as the national president of the party and Amar Singh was expelled from the party
 mulaayam singh ko rashtriya adhyaksh se bedakhal karne ke saath hi shivpal yadav kaa party pradesh ke adhyaksh kaa pad bhi chin liya gaya
 Akhilesh Khema also confronts Amar Singh at the root of the feud between the party and father-son
 ullekhneey he ki sapa main mache ghamaasan ke bich ek janvari ko sapa ke ek dhade ne party se baghawat karte hue ek akhilesh yadav ko party kaa rashtriya adhyaksh chun liya or amar singh ko party se baahar nikaal diya gaya
 With the ouster of Mulayam Singh from the national president, Shivpal Yadav's post of party state president was also taken away
 akhilesh khemaa party or pita-putr main jhagade kii jad bhi amar singh ko tehraata he

 dangal fame diarector nitesh tiwari kaa mahatvakankshi project ramayana kaaphi samay se charchaa main he
 There is tremendous buzz about the casting of the film
 reports hai ki ruthik roshan ko ram or deepika padukon ko sita ke role main cast karne kii planning he
 Meanwhile, there are reports that South Superstar Prabhas has been approached to play the role of Ravana
 pichley dinon pinkavila se baatcheet main nitesh tiwari ne kaha tha- chhichhore ke baad main ramayana banane ja rahaa hum
 It will be a trilogy
 ham is project ko banane ke liye har sambhav koshish kar rahe hai
 When Nitesh was asked about casting Deepika and Hrithik Roshan, he said - We are at concept level right now
 hamane abhi casting ke bare main sochaa tak nahin he
 But a source associated with the production said that for the first time in the Ramayana, hrithik-deepika will share the screen
 iske alaava ek popular superstar ravan kaa role play karegaa
 The source revealed that the makers have kept a budget of 600 crores for the Ramayana
 ye kisi bhi indian film ke liye sin kiya jane vaala bada bajet he
 It will be released across India
 ise hindi, tamil or telugu main relies kiya jayega
 The team wants Bahubali star Prabhas to play the role of Ravana
 unka maananaa he ki prabhas kii persenality is kairactor ko suut karegi
 His physique is perfectly fit for Ravana's role
 lekin abhi deal lock nahin hui he
 Prabhas has not taken any decision yet
 sutara ke mutabik, allu arvind, namith malhotra or madhu mantina ne pehali baar nitesh tiwari ke is project ke liye haath milaayaa he
 The SP does not want to leave the BSP in any way to defeat the Narendra Modi-led BJP in 2019
 yahi vajah he ki sapa upi main basapa kii junior partner banane ko bhi taiyaar he
 Before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the pressure of BSP President Mayawati on the alliance has started to work
 sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav ne ravivaar ko mainpuri main ek sabha ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki gathbandhan ke liye vah tyaag ko taiyaar hai or agar unhen gathbandhan karne ke liye do-chaar siten kam par bhi samjhauta karnaa pade to vah peeche nahin hatenge
 Let me tell you that before Kairana Lok Sabha by-election, Mayawati had made it clear that if she did not get respectable seats, her party would contest alone
 mayawati ke is bayaan ko raajnneetik taur par ek bade bayaan ke taur par dekha ja rahaa tha, jisamen unhen bada partner maanane kii ek jid nihit thi
 In Mainpuri, Akhilesh Yadav has once again put his arms before Mayawati for an alliance and in the name of renunciation, he has also approved Mayawati as a big partner
 ab dekhnaa yah he akhilesh yadav ke lagbhag junior partner banane ke liye taiyaar ho jane ke baad kitni siton par donon partiyon ke bich samjhauta hota he
 Significantly, there are a total of 80 parliamentary seats in UP
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main modi lahar main bijepi gathbandhan ne 73 siton par jeet hasil kii thi
 SP got 5 seats and Congress 2 seats
 jabaki basapa kaa khaataa bhi nahin khulaa tha
 Similarly, in the UP assembly elections held last year, the SP managed to win more seats than the BSP
 haalanki in chunaavon main donon partiyaan alag-alag chunaav ladi thi
 In the phulpur-gorakhpur by-election, the SP was supported by the BSP
 iskaa nateeja tha ki bijepi ko karaari haar mili
 The relationship between the two parties has since strengthened
 yahi vajah he ki akhilesh yadav basapa kaa saath kisi bhi surat main chhodane ko taiyaar nahin he

 bombai hai court ne udyogpati vijay maalya ke lagjri vimaan kii nilaamee naa hone par naaraazgi jataai he
 The court on Tuesday directed the service tax department to re-estimate the auction price
 court ne kaha he ki mulya tay karne se pehle dastavejon ko court main pesh kiya jaae uske baad nilaamee ke liye vibhaag ko samay diya jayega
 During the debate in the court, it was clarified by the service tax department that the tender received for the auction is much less than the reserve price, due to which the auction process has not been completed
 jabaki mubani international airport kii ore se vakil ne kaha ki vibhaag nilaamee se rakam vasuul kar paane main khud ko asamarth paa rahaa he

 airport prabandhan kii ore se daleel di gai ki maalya ke vimaan se duusare airport par duusare jaruri kaam prabhavit ho rahe hai
 Mallya's plane has just surrounded the airport and should be sold in junk
 vijay maalya kaa lagjri vimaan‘airbas e319’disambar, 2013 se parkig main khadaa he
 The service tax department has not been auctioned so far despite three attempts

 Mallya has escaped from the country and is now trying to make a debt by selling his assets
 vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne bazaar main ai susti ko dur karne or arthvyavastha ko durust karne ke liye alag-alag sectors, udyog or aam aadmi ko mandi se raahat dene ke liye kai elaan kiye
 Nirmala Sitharaman may be talking about not worrying about India's economic slowdown by comparing it to other countries, but the situation of economic slowdown on the ground is presenting another picture
 mandi ke badal teji se kaale or ghaney hote ja rahe hai or iskaa asar auto, real estate, telecom or banking se lekar steel or textile jaise sectoron par dikhnaa shuru ho gaya he
 These are the four main reasons for the economic slowdown
 
 
 - pehali vajah to antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii badhati keemten hai, jiskaa asar mahangaai dar par padaa he
 - Second reason is the depreciating value of the rupee against the dollar, the price of one US dollar is touching the 72 rupee figure
 - aayaat ke mukaable niryaat main giravat se desh kaa rajkoshiya ghaataa badha or videshi mudra bhandar main kami ai he
 Apart from this, due to the ongoing trade war between the US and China, the risk of economic slowdown in the world is increasing rapidly, which has also affected India
 vaise ye to bahari vajah hai, jo desh main aarthik mandi ko badhaava de rahi hai
 But its internal reasons are much larger
 jaise ki arthvyavastha ke mahatvapurn audyogic kshetron main giravat, demand or supplai ke bich lagaataar kam hota antar or nivesh main maamuli kami jaisi chijen mandi kii taraf ishaara kar rahi hai
 The effect of which is now visible
 jaaniye aisi baaten jo aarthik mandi kaa alarm baja rahi hai
 
 
 
 
 - The country's auto sector has gone into reverse gear
 auto industry main lagaataar nau maheene se bikri main giravat darj ho rahi he
 Sales of cars and motorcycles declined by 31 percent in July
 jisaki vajah se auto sector se jude saadhe teen lakh se zyada karmchaariyon kii naukari chali gai or kareeb 10 lakh naukariyaan khatre main hai
 - After agriculture sector, the textile sector, which employs 10 crore people, is also in poor condition
 nordarn india textile mills association ne to baqayada akhabaaron main vigyaapan dekar khulaasa kiya he ki desh ke kapadaa udyog main 34
 There has been a decline of 6 percent
 jisaki vajah se 25 se 30 lakh naukariyaan jane kii ashanka he
 - Similar situation is in real estate sector, where till March 2019 12 lakh 80 thousand houses are ready in 30 big cities of India but their buyers are not available
 yani builder jis gati se makaan bana rahe hai log us gati se kharid nahin rahe
 According to recently released data by RBI, there has been a decline in the loans given by banks to industries
 petroleum, khanan, textile, fertiliser or telecom jaise sectors ne karj lenaa kam kar diya he
 It is the effect of the recession that 5 in gold and silver imports in the quarter from April to June 2019
 3 fisadi kii kami ai he
 While in the same period last year 6
 3 fisadi kii badhat dekhi gai thi
 The slowdown in investment and industrial production is also reflecting the slowdown in the Indian stock market
 sensex 40 hajaar kaa aankada chhukar ab phir 37 hajaar par aakar atak gaya he
 According to the data released by the Central Statistical Organization, the country's GDP growth rate in 2018-19 is 6
 8 pratishat rahi jo beete 5 saalon main sabase kam he
 After which the RBI sensing the recession, reduced the growth rate for the year 2019-20 to 6
 9 fisadi kar diya he
 These are the figures which warn the country from the economic downturn
 jiske bare main niti ayog ke vaais chairman rajeev kumaar ne bhi desh ko aagaah kiya or aarthik mandi ko lekar sarkari nitiyon or faislon ko bhi katghare main khadaa kiya he
 Opposition parties are stunned after the statement of National self-service Association (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat regarding reservation
 congress ne aresas or bijepi par dalit-pichhadaa virdohi hone kaa aarope lagaaya
 Seeing the escalation of the dispute, the RSS has issued a clarification
 aresas ke akhil bhartiya prachaar pramukh arun kumaar ne kaha ki sarasanghachaalak mohan bhagwat ke dilli main ek kaarykram main die gaye bhaashan ke ek bhaag par anaavashyak vivaad khadaa karne kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he
 He said in a statement released on Twitter that he had called for expressing views on a sensitive subject like reservation, stating the importance of resolving all questions on the basis of good mutual interaction in society
 arun kumaar ne kaha ki jahaan tak sangh kaa aarakshan ke vishay par mat he, vah anek baar spasht kiya ja chukaa he ki anusuchit jati, janajati, obisi or aarthik aadhaar par pichhadon ke aarakshan kaa sangh purna samarthan karata he
 At the same time, BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain also said in favor of Bhagwat that Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat has said that there should be a dialogue on reservation, what is wrong in this? What does anyone object to the dialogue? He further said that PM Modi has already said that there was reservation, there is reservation and there will be reservation
 unhone kaha ki pehle bhi mohan bhagwat ke bayaan ko galat samajha gaya tha ab bhi galat samajha ja rahaa he
 Modi government has given 10 percent reservation to general castes instead of abolishing the reservation, which was also welcomed by SC / ST and OBC sections without reducing the reservation of SC / ST or OBC quota
 hossain ne kaha ki mujhe lagata he ki vipaksh is par raajnneeti karne kii koshish kar rahaa he lekin is par wo kaamyaab nahin honge
 rss's All India Publicity chief Arun Kumar said in a tweet, "as far as the Sangh's opinion is on the subject of reservation, it has been clarified many times that Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Other Backward Classes (OBC) and (RSS) fully supports the reservation of backward on economic grounds
 'kumaar ne twit main kaha ki dilli main ek kaarykram main die mohan bhagwat ke bhaashan ke ek bhaag par anaavashyak vivaad khadaa kiya ja rahaa he
 It is worth mentioning that on Sunday, Bhagwat had said that those who are in favor of reservation and those who are against it, it should be discussed in a harmonious atmosphere
 congress or basapa jaisi vipakshi partiyon ne bhagwat kii is tippanee ko lekar bhaajapa or iske vaicharik sanghathan aresas par prahaar kiya he
 Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said that Bhagwat's remarks have exposed the 'anti-dalit-backward' face of the RSS-BJP

 dakshin africa ke ballebaajon ne paanchaven or aakhri vanade main bhartiya gendbaajon kii jamkar dhunaai kii, lekin captain mahendra singh dhoni ne unka bachaav karte hue kaha ki wicket se unhen koi khaas madad nahin mil rahi thi
 Batting first, South Africa scored a mammoth 438 for four and then dismissed India for 224 in 36 overs
 dhoni ne match ke baad kaha, dakshin africa ne apni ballebaaji kii shuruyaat shandaar kii or baad main usne teji se ran banane jari rakhe
 As they were playing, a score of more than 350 seemed certain to be scored
 lekin yah ballebaaji ke liye acha wicket tha
 He said, our fast bowlers were not getting help from the pitch
 unke bounsar par bhi naakaam sabit hue
 Our spinners were also not getting turn
 ham vankhede ke wicket ko jaanate hai ki hamaare gendbaajon ke liye kuch bhi anukool nahin rahaa
 The comments bharat ke lakshya ke peechha karne ke bare main unhone kaha, sabhi ballebaajon ne apni taraf se sarvshereshth prayaas kiya
 But when the run rate reached above 15 runs per over after the 25th over, the task was difficult for us
 dhoni kaha, yah ek aisa match rahaa, jisane hamen siries jeetne kii daud se baahar kiya
 But this happens in cricket and we cannot do anything special
 test cricket se sanyas le chuke dhoni ne kaha ki bharat, dakshin africa ke khilaaf 5 november se mohali main shuru hone vaali test siries main acha pradarshan karegi
 He said, it is a well balanced team
 hamaare paas achche tej gendbaaj or spinner hai, jo acha pradarshan kar sakate hai
 We have batsmen who are doing well
 team acha pradarshan karegi
 Dhoni said after the match, South Africa started their batting brilliantly and later they continued to score fast
 jaisaa ve khel rahe the 350 se adhik kaa score bananaa tay lag rahaa tha
 But it was a good wicket for batting
 unhone kaha, hamaare tej gendbaajon ko pich se madad nahin mil rahi thi
 His bouncers also proved to be unsuccessful
 hamaare spinneron ko bhi turn nahin mil rahaa tha
 We know Wankhede's wicket that nothing was favorable for our bowlers
 tippaniyan Regarding chasing India's target, he said, all batsmen tried their best
 lekin jab 25wein over ke baad ran rate 15 ran prati over se upar pahunch gaya, tab hamaare liye kaam mushkil ho gaya tha
 It was a match that put us out of the race to win the series, said Dhoni
 lekin cricket main aisa hota he or ham kuch khaas nahin kar sakate
 Dhoni, who retired from Test cricket, said that India will do well in the Test series against South Africa starting November 5 in Mohali
 unhone kaha, yah acchhee santulit team he
 We have good fast bowlers and spinners, who can perform well

 While the SP candidate Praveen Nishad set a record for victory in this Lok Sabha seat under the influence of Gorakhnath temple, the Congress also made an unsolicited record that has put its political credibility at stake here
 is baar kii haar ke saath hi congress na sirf gorakhpur main buree tarah haari, balki ye lagaataar saatvin haar he jisamen congress pratyaashee apni jamaanat tak nahin bachaa sake

 Earlier in the 2014 elections, the Congress fielded Ashtabhuja Prasad Tripathi in the election, but in the Yogi wave, he 'flowed' that his bail was also forfeited
 unhen 45693 vot mili
 In 2009, Lal Chand Nishad entered the electoral battle on the Congress ticket, but he did not get any benefit from the Congress being in power at the Center
 yogi ke prabhaav ke chalate unhen sirf 30262 mat hi mili
 In the 2004 general election, Congress fielded Sharadendu Pandey, but he could also get only 33477 votes
 1999 main congress ne yahaan se muslim pratruashi dow
 Launched Syed Jamal but he too could not do any good and got only 20026 votes
 1998 main hue chunaav main congress kii ore se lagaataar duusari baar harikesh bahadur utre, lekin unhen bhi sirf 22621 vot hi mili
 In the 1996 election, Harikesh Bahadur could get only 14549 votes, which could not succeed in saving the bail
 is bargorakhpur ke upachunaavamein bhagava garh main sendhamari karte hue sapa pratyaashee praveen nishad ne bhaajapa pratyaashee upendra shukla ko 21881 maton se haraaya he
 Praveen Nishad got a record 456513 votes in the election
 vahiin bhaajapa pratyaashee upendra shukla ko 434632 vot mili

 Former Indian cricketer and now commentator Sanjay Manjrekar has clarified the remarks made while commentating on Karen Pollard
 unhone kaha ki unhone pollard ko kabhi ‘buddhiheen’ nahin kaha tha
 It was also clear from the video footage that Manjrekar did not use the word 'unintelligent' but Pollard took to Twitter to slam the former cricketer, following which there was a strong reaction on social media
 manjrekar ne twit kiya, 'kaha tha ki kya vah upree kram main ballebaaji karne kii kshamta rakhte hai
 It is not my style to use words like 'brainless' or 'don't have brains'
 main aalochak ho saktaa hum lekin apmaan kabhi nahin kar saktaa
 He further wrote, 'I will also ask those reacting to the Pollard case to listen to the footage
 'https: / / t

 Never used the words brains or brainless

 iske alaava soshal media par bhi unhen kaaphi aalochana kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Pollard felt that this Indian while commentating had dubbed him as 'brainless'
 pollard ne apane pehle twit main likhaa, 'sanjay manjrekar aapako kya lagata he ki ki aapako kuch bhi bolne kii aazaadee he kyonki aapako bolne ke liye paisa diya jaataa to aap bakawaas karnaa jari rakh sakate ho
 'said "does he have the range?" Using terms like' no brains' or 'brainless' not my style
 i can be critical but never insulting
 - Sanjay Manjrekar (@sanjaymanjrekar) April 15, 2017I would also encourage all those reacting to the Pollard issue to hear the footage & not just take my word for it

 congress netaa abhishek manu singhvi ne daawa kiya ki aadhaar par modi sarkaar ko supreme court se bada jhatka laga he
 The court has rejected 90 percent of the claims of the current central government
 unhone kaha, 'centre kii modi sarkaar ne UPA dwaara gathit achche aadhaar bill ko puri tareeke se khatm kar diya tha
 It can be learned from BJP how to eliminate any good concept

 To the extent that one has to think, the famous Vijender, who has won 10 out of 10 matches in professional boxing, has missed something

 But it is also true that those whom Vijender has defeated so far are not the ones who create fear in the hearts and minds of the famous boxers

 The matter is complicated
 british mukkebaaz rocky fielding july main tyran jeg ke khilaaf ring main utre
 Fielding has been mostly away from the glare, and has been fighting boxers whom Vijender has beaten in almost all matches, while Jegg is the "regular" WBA Super Middleweight title holder (in contrast to the "super" title of Britain's Jordan Groves since 2017 Is near)
 muqabla fielding ne jeeta
 Jegg Chit in five rounds
 jeg or fielding kaa muqabla dekhte hue aap sochenge ki vijender ne donon main se kisi ke bhi khilaaf bahut achche-se nibata hota, kyonki unka rakshaatmak or chaukanna andaaj donon ke zyada aakraamak khel par baari hota
 Had it not been so, Vijender would have been a contender for a more sensible belt
 ab marke kii baatah pichley dinon fielding-vijender mukaable kii baat chal rahi thi par yah hua nahin
 Francis Warren of Queensberry Promotions, the manager of Vijender's matches abroad, confesses that "I loved seeing Vijender reach further"
 ''july main kaamanwealth belt ke liye lee marakham ke khilaaf jarur ek fite hone vaali thi, jo marakham kii chot ke chalate nahin ho pai
 But an interesting point: Fielding still held the Commonwealth title until recently and then left it in the wake of more big matches
 isiilie ve vijender se ladgaye nahin utre
 Vijender, however, did not bother much with his pace
 ve sitambar main kaamanwealth khitaab ke liye "ek bade mukkebaaz'' (naam kaa intjaar kiijie) ke khilaaf agali ladaai kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 They believe that it was good not to meet Fielding
 "main maayoos nahin
 Because now they are world champions and now i will fight for the world championship
 ab mujhe pehle, duusare or tisare number waalon se mukaable kii jarurat he
 Vijender is happy and full of confidence
 khush warren bhi hai, par ve jodate hai, "unke maamle main ham teen-chaar maheene peeche hai
 "and time is running out
" ve 32 saal ke hai, us umr se mahaj ek saal dur, jab ek pichley super-middlawet andre ward ritair ho gaye the
 They are at least two years older than any defending champion
 vijender ke nazariye se acchhee baat yah he ki teen-chaar maheene profeshnal boxing main banane-bigadgaye ke liye zyada nahin hote
 Once you reach 12 rounds of bouts here, there are one or two fights a year
 bharat main vijender kii manager company ioes sports ke neerav tomars kehete hai, "ham zyada phikrmand nahin hai
 If Warren and Tomar are to be believed, Vijender is moving towards a big title fight
 bakaul tomars, "jo bhi antarrashtriya khitaab uplabdh ho
 "and in the words of Warren," WBO title match over the next 12 months is likely to be a world title, "isn't the management's dual system pulling Vijender in different directions? One of the most experienced voices in professional boxing It is reasonable to trust Warren when he says, "vijender's skill is very high

 Talk with actress Shweta Basu Prasad on issues such as The Tashkent Files, Role in the film, Shastri's death, Expectation from Modi, Classical Music, Career, Nevin Kumarnell i liked the script of the files
 yah hamaare purv pradhanmantri bahadur shastri kii maut par aadhaarit he
 His death remains mysterious even after 53 years
 meri tarah aaj kaa yuva bhi chahta he ki is rahasy par se paradaa uthe
 So does this film hide the mystery? For this you will have to watch the film
 aapako sochane ke liye majaboor karegi
 It is an investigative thriller film
 film main aap kya role adaa kar rahi hai?main aaj kii patrkaar raagini phule kaa role kar rahi hum jo ek report chhapati he ki shastri ji kii maut kii postmortem report kahaan he
 This is followed by uproar and an inquiry commission sits
 shastri ji kii hatya ke sawaal se aap kitni sahamat hai?sawaal yah nahin he ki shastri ji kii hatya kisne kii
 The question is how he died
 jis paristhiti main wo laae gaye the palampur airport par wo bahut hi rahasyamay tha
 Her face was blue, i don't think she was a natural death
 agar heart atake hua tha to postmortem report de den
 What do the families of Shastri want? They also want to know the reality
 film main sunil shastri or anil shastri ke bhi intervyuu hai
 Do you have any expectation from Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Shastri's death? If Modi ji sees the film and sets up a commission of inquiry on Shastri's death, our objective of making the film will be fulfilled
 jarnalism karne ke baad aapkaa man us disha main kaam karne kaa nahin hua?jarnalism se grajuation karne ke baad maine acting nahin kii balki chaar-paanch saalon tak camere ke peeche kaam kiya
 On the subject of why classical music is less popular, i made a documentary route in which i interviewed Pandit Jasraj, AR Rahman, Vishal Bhardwaj, Hariprasad Chaurasiaji, Amjad Ali Khan
 ise aap abhi netflix par dekh sakate hai
 i think classic music should be preferred in the education system
 vaise, agar main phir se acting kii duniya main nahin lauti hoti to shaayad main bibisi yaa discovery ke liye dacumentary banane nikal padati
 After taking the National Award as a child artist, was there any mistake regarding career? Not at all
 acting kii duniya main rahati to main afsos bhi karti ki meraa bachapan chhot gaya, meri padhai chhot gai
 There are many child actors who regret that their childhood has been lost

 (news agency bhashaa se bhi input) In a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) President Raj Thackeray said on Friday that the word 'pradhan Sevak' was first introduced by the country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru
 manase pramukh raaj thakare ne piem modi par tanj kase hue yah bhi kaha ki aap nehru or indira gandhi ko gaali dete rahe, lekin aap abhi bhi unki copy karte hai
 Raj Thackeray said that there is a plaque in the Nehru Memorial Museum in Teen Murti Bhawan in New Delhi, which is written by Pandit Nehru
 "is desh kii janata hamen pradhanmantri naa kahe, pratham sevak kahe
 "thackeray said amid applause," but he (modi) just changed the 'first servant' to 'pradhan Sevak'
 " thakare yahaan congress ke netritv vaale 56 dalon ke mahagathbandhan ke liye ek sabha ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 Raj Thackeray said, "you kept abusing Nehru and Indira Gandhi, but you still copy them
 pichley paanch saalon ke dauraan aapane har mudde par sirf jhooth bolaa he
 "he also rejected Modi's allegation, in which he has repeatedly said that no one from the Congress family had met Bhagat Singh in jail when he faced the death penalty during the freedom struggle

 There will no longer be any liquor shop on the national highway ie the national highway and the state highway ie 500 meters here and there
 aadesh supreme court kaa he
 See media coverage
 meet ke kawarej main avaidh ko vaid banane par jor he
 License will have to be taken otherwise the police and the government will attack the mob
 sharaab ke samay aisa jor nahin he ki supreme court ne jaisaa kaha he vaisaa hi paalan hona chahie
 The question of wine, tourism, revenue and employment were prominently linked
 boojadkhaane or meet ke vakt vaid or avaidh ko hi pramukhataa mili
 We want to present samples of some newspaper headlines so that you can see what was the language and intent of the media at the time of the meat and slaughterhouses
 - ection main yogi, log kush, avaidh boojadkhaanon par taale - Meat factory administration unlicensed sealed - shahar main sanchalit teen avaidh boojadkhaane sil - Campaign to stop illegal slaughterhouse started - zile main pashu kataan par laga rahaa aghoshit pratibandh - Meat traders on strike to protest action - upi main boojadkhaanon par karrwai, jaane vaid avaidh kaa antar - The headlines of English newspapers were like this - 17 rules UP meat sellers must follow - how up's meat business was run before Yogi Adityanath cracked the whip - This Is How The Slaughterhouse Ban In Uttar Pradesh Will Cripple Revenue, Cost Millions Of Jobs Not only was the police raiding the abattoirs and meat cock shops, some people were also doing what they considered themselves to be the government volunteers
 meet kii dukaane kisne jalaai aakhir
 Beef and meat have been arranged in the same line, whereas beef or cow slaughter has been prohibited in UP since the 1950s
 rajya sarkaar cheekhti rahi ki uskaa faisla kisi samudaay vishesh ke prati nahin he
 Those who have a license need not worry
 boojadkhaanon ko avaidh bataaya gaya magar kya yah bataaya gaya ki vahaan kya cat rahaa tha
 Goat, buffalo or cow
 bajaay is antar ke sabko aise pesh kiya gaya jaise avaidh boojadkhaane kaa matlab vahaan gaumance kaa kaarobaar ho rahaa ho
 This was the tone of the language of the media
 tone vah hua jo jor jor se bolaa ja rahaa he, andertone wo hua jo bina bole bolaa ja rahaa he
 Which side did the media highlight in order to remove liquor shops within a radius of 500 meters adjacent to national and state highways
 rajya sarkarein rajmargon kaa darja badalakar raahat de rahi hai
 The highway is being brought under the purview of the municipality
 phir is faisle kaa kya matlab rah jayega
 In the media coverage, the closed shops of liquor were shown as if the house of the global economy was destroyed
 reporter se lekar ankar kii bhashaa main in dukaanon ke prati sahanubhuti dikhi, rojgaar or kaarobaar ke nuksaan ke paksh ko zyaada majbooti se ubhaara gaya
 Shown how Freedom of Choice has been attacked
 iske tone andertone main aapako samudaay kaa rang nahin milegaa
 That is why the liquor businessman was able to present himself with confidence to the media
 puure kawarej main aapako sadak durghatana kaa paksh yaa to gaayab dikhegaa yaa kamazor dikhegaa
 How quickly did the media sympathize with liquor shops, especially the English media
 uske hedlins is tarah rahe
 
 
 - HOW MUMBAI COPED WITH LIQUOR BAN ALONG HIGHWAYS - SC highway booze ban causes long lines, short tempers - Highway liquor ban: 5,000 people may lose jobs in Chandigarh - sc's highway liquor ban is disastrous, will kill hospitality sector, hit one million jobs - Liquor ban along highways: How court orders leave state coffers dry - Shrinking exchequers is what state governments are most worried about - SC highway booze ban causes long lines, short tempers meet dukandaaron ko media vaid hone kaa lacture de rahaa tha, sharaab dukaanon ko lacture dena bhul gaya ki supreme court kaa aadesh he paalan kiijie
 Those people who disappeared were wandering in UP and checking the license of meat shops, making them legal
 ab aate hai sharaab kaarobaariyon ke masale par
 They are indeed trapped by the order of the Supreme Court
 achaanak unke saamne dukaane band hone kaa khatara paidaa ho gaya he jinhen sarkaar se license lekar hi kholaa tha
 But imagine how sympathetic the media is showing these things, the same campaign drives the media against the road accident
 kya aap meet dukaanon ke kawarez main footpath par meet murga bechney waalon kii kahani jaan saken, jinaki dukaane hataa di gayi hai
 Even their livelihood has been taken away
 hotel koi bottle nahin he ki jeb main rakhkar kahin or chalate bane
 One million people are being claimed to be associated with it
 2 lakh karod kaa kaarobaar bataaya ja rahaa he
 The decision of the Supreme Court will affect thousands of bars, pubs, shops along the highway
 naukariyaan jaaengi
 This court will not think, if the government does not think then who will think
 supreme court ne kyon aisa faisla diya
 Will also have to think
 sadak durghatana se marane waalon main pachis pratishat nashe ke kaaran gaadi chalaane ke kaaran maare jate hai
 Every year more than 6000 people die from accidents caused by alcohol
 kya koi adaalat ise dekhati rah sakati he
 a decision has resulted in a crisis on employment of more people than they could save in one stroke
 kya supreme court ke aadesh se kuch bhi ankush nahin lagegaa
 Why governments opened liquor shops along the highway
 dand sarkaron ko dena chahie, mil gaya dukandaaron ko
 The comments ankar red wine ke phaayde bataa rahe hai, jaise meet se protein nahin miltaa he
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has challenged the central government to show them by implementing liquor ban
 bijepi shasit rajyon main sharabbandi kare
 Our politics is also behind liquor
 darasal hamaari aadhuniktaa or raajnneeti kaa tair panchar ho gaya he
 His car is stuck
 sadak or parivahan mantri nitin gadakari kaa loksabhaa main diya gaya bayaan he ki 'bharat main har saal paanch lakh sadak durghatnaayen hoti hai
 Due to this, one and a half lakh people are killed every year, causing a loss of 55000 crores annually
 yah raashi jidipi kaa teen pratishat he
 ' 18 march 2014 ko punjab haryana hoicourt ke chif justise ne faisla diya tha ki haive ke kinare khuli sharaab kii dukaane dikhni nahin chahie or in tak pahunchane kaa rasta band ho janaa chahie
 So before the Supreme Court, the High Court gave such a decision
 tab punjab or haryana kii sarkarein supreme court chali gayi
 The damage is also from a road accident, also by a Supreme Court ruling

 rajya sarkarein rajmargon kaa darja badalakar raahat de rahi hai
 The highway is being brought under the purview of the municipality
 phir is faisle kaa kya matlab rah jayega
 In the media coverage, the closed shops of liquor were shown as if the house of the global economy was destroyed
 reporter se lekar ankar kii bhashaa main in dukaanon ke prati sahanubhuti dikhi, rojgaar or kaarobaar ke nuksaan ke paksh ko zyaada majbooti se ubhaara gaya
 Shown how Freedom of Choice has been attacked
 iske tone andertone main aapako samudaay kaa rang nahin milegaa
 That is why the liquor businessman was able to present himself with confidence to the media
 puure kawarej main aapako sadak durghatana kaa paksh yaa to gaayab dikhegaa yaa kamazor dikhegaa
 How quickly did the media sympathize with liquor shops, especially the English media
 uske hedlins is tarah rahe
 
 
 - HOW MUMBAI COPED WITH LIQUOR BAN ALONG HIGHWAYS - SC highway booze ban causes long lines, short tempers - Highway liquor ban: 5,000 people may lose jobs in Chandigarh - sc's highway liquor ban is disastrous, will kill hospitality sector, hit one million jobs - Liquor ban along highways: How court orders leave state coffers dry - Shrinking exchequers is what state governments are most worried about - SC highway booze ban causes long lines, short tempers meet dukandaaron ko media vaid hone kaa lacture de rahaa tha, sharaab dukaanon ko lacture dena bhul gaya ki supreme court kaa aadesh he paalan kiijie
 Those people who disappeared were wandering in UP and checking the license of meat shops, making them legal
 ab aate hai sharaab kaarobaariyon ke masale par
 They are indeed trapped by the order of the Supreme Court
 achaanak unke saamne dukaane band hone kaa khatara paidaa ho gaya he jinhen sarkaar se license lekar hi kholaa tha
 But imagine how sympathetic the media is showing these things, the same campaign drives the media against the road accident
 kya aap meet dukaanon ke kawarez main footpath par meet murga bechney waalon kii kahani jaan saken, jinaki dukaane hataa di gayi hai
 Even their livelihood has been taken away
 hotel koi bottle nahin he ki jeb main rakhkar kahin or chalate bane
 One million people are being claimed to be associated with it
 2 lakh karod kaa kaarobaar bataaya ja rahaa he
 The decision of the Supreme Court will affect thousands of bars, pubs, shops along the highway
 naukariyaan jaaengi
 This court will not think, if the government does not think then who will think
 supreme court ne kyon aisa faisla diya
 Will also have to think
 sadak durghatana se marane waalon main pachis pratishat nashe ke kaaran gaadi chalaane ke kaaran maare jate hai
 Every year more than 6000 people die from accidents caused by alcohol
 kya koi adaalat ise dekhati rah sakati he
 a decision has resulted in a crisis on employment of more people than they could save in one stroke
 kya supreme court ke aadesh se kuch bhi ankush nahin lagegaa
 Why governments opened liquor shops along the highway
 dand sarkaron ko dena chahie, mil gaya dukandaaron ko
 The comments ankar red wine ke phaayde bataa rahe hai, jaise meet se protein nahin miltaa he
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has challenged the central government to show them by implementing liquor ban
 bijepi shasit rajyon main sharabbandi kare
 Our politics is also behind liquor
 darasal hamaari aadhuniktaa or raajnneeti kaa tair panchar ho gaya he
 His car is stuck
 sadak or parivahan mantri nitin gadakari kaa loksabhaa main diya gaya bayaan he ki 'bharat main har saal paanch lakh sadak durghatnaayen hoti hai
 Due to this, one and a half lakh people are killed every year, causing a loss of 55000 crores annually
 yah raashi jidipi kaa teen pratishat he
 ' 18 march 2014 ko punjab haryana hoicourt ke chif justise ne faisla diya tha ki haive ke kinare khuli sharaab kii dukaane dikhni nahin chahie or in tak pahunchane kaa rasta band ho janaa chahie
 So before the Supreme Court, the High Court gave such a decision
 tab punjab or haryana kii sarkarein supreme court chali gayi
 The damage is also from a road accident, also by a Supreme Court ruling
 boojadkhaanon or meet murga kii dukaanon par chhapamari police hi nahin kar rahi thi, kuch log bhi kar rahe the jo khud ko sarkaar ke swanyasevak samaj rahe the
 Who lit the meat shops? gaumance or maance ko ek hi qatari main bitha diya gaya jabaki upi main 1950 ke dashak se hi gaumance yaa gau hatya pratibandhit he
 The state government shouted that its decision is not towards any particular community
 jiske paas license he unhen chintaa karne kii zarurat nahin he
 Slaughterhouses were declared illegal, but was it told what was being cut there
 bakra, bhens yaa gaay
 Instead, this difference was presented to everyone as if the illegal slaughterhouse meant the beef business there
 ye media kii bhashaa kaa tone tha
 The tone is what is being spoken out loud, the undertones are what is being spoken
 rashtriya or rajkeey rajmargon se sate 500 ke meter ke daayre main sharaab kii dukaanon ko hataane ke aadesh main media ne kis paksh ko ubhaara
 State governments are giving relief by changing the status of highways
 haive ko nagarpalika ke daayre main laayaa ja rahaa he
 Then what will be the meaning of this decision
 media ke kawarej main sharaab kii band dukaanon ko aise dikhaaya gaya jaise global arthvyavastha kaa ghar ujaad gaya ho
 In the language of the reporter to the anchor, these shops showed sympathy, the strength of loss of employment and business was more strongly highlighted
 dikhaaya gaya ki kis tarah se freedom of chwis par hamalaa hua he
 You will not find the color of the community in its tone undertones
 isliye sharaab kaarobaari puure aatmavishvaas ke saath apni baat media ke saamne rakh sake
 In the entire coverage, you will see the side of road accident either missing or weak
 media kitni jaldi sharaab kii dukaanon ke prati sahanubhuti rakhane laga khaskar angrezi media
 His headlines stayed like this

 com / nzkejpulrs Let us tell you that on 26 February, after the Pulwama terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir, India attacked the terrorist base of Jaish, which was on Pakistani territory
 bhartiya vayusena ne pakistan ke balakot main jaish e mohammad keatanki shivi par 1000 kilo ke bam giraayethe
 It was reported that many terrorists were killed
 bharat ne kareeb 12 miraj ladaaku vimaanon kaa istemaal kiya or1000 kilo bamon kii barishkar di
 After this Pakistan's anger started coming out and it tried to reject the claim of India
 bhartiya vayusena kii karrwai ke agle hi din pakistan ke ladaaku jahaaj bhartiya seemaa main ghusane kaa prayaas kar rahe the
 The IAF gave a befitting reply to this
 vayusena keving commander abhinandan 27 farvari ko subah kareeb das baje pakistani vayusena ke fiter plane kaa peechha karte hue pakistan kii seemaa main ja ghuse the
 Abhinandan's plane also crashed after Pakistan killed the F-16
 is vajah se unhen kisi tarah parachute kii madad se utarana padaa
 He was later released by Pakistan after nearly 60 hours
 lokapal bill ke nae draft ko cabinet kii manjuuri mil gai he
 The amendment to the Lokpal bill was approved in the cabinet meeting held on Thursday
 ab is bahupratikshit bill ko sansad ke aagaamee bajet satr main rajyasabha main pesh kiya jayega
 Significantly, the Lokpal bill that the government was bringing before it passed in the Lok Sabha but got stuck in the Rajya Sabha
 tab sarkaar ne ise select kamity ke paas vichaar ke liye bheja tha
 Now the Lokpal Bill passed by the Cabinet has included all the suggestions of the Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha
 sarkaar kaa daawa he ki is par tamaam siyaasi dalon kii sahmati he or cabinet kii manjuuri ke baad ise sansad se paas karaane main dikkat nahin aegi
 However, social activist Anna Hazare termed the cabinet meeting on Thursday as a drama
 unhone kaha ki bhrashtachar ke khilaaf sarkaar niyat or manshaa saaf nahin he
 How is the new bill of Lokpal different from the old one? 1
 nae bill main rajyon main lokayukta banane kaa adhikaar rajya sarkaron par chhod diya gaya he, jabaki puraane bill main rajya sarkaron ke liye saal bhar ke bheetar lokayukta kii niyukti jaruri thi
 State governments had strongly opposed it as an interference in their authority
 2
 According to the new bill, five people will be appointed together with the Lokpal
 jinamein pradhanmantri, netaa vipaksh, supreme court ke mukhya nyaayadhish, loksabhaa adhyaksh shaamil honge iske alaava paanchvaan sadsy piem or netaa vipaksh dwaara chunaa gaya koi nyayavid hoga
 In the first appointment PAN, only the Prime Minister, Leader of Opposition, Chief Justice of Supreme Court and Speaker of Lok Sabha were kept
 3
 The new bill empowers the Lokpal to run cases against government employees
 pehle ye adhikaar sarkaar ke paas tha
 4
 nae bill main dharmik sansthaaon ko chhod sabhi enjio ko lokapal ke daayre main rakhaa gaya he
 All ngos in the old bill were outside the Lokpal
 5
 The new bill will give government officials a chance to present their case before the Lokpal before the inquiry
 pehle unke paas ye adhikaar nahin tha
 6
 iske alaava sarkaar ne select cameti kii ye sifarish bhi maan lee he ki sibiai ke diarector of prosicution kii niyukti sivisi kare
 7
 sarkaar ne ye bhi maan liya he ki sibiai ke jo adhikari lokapal dwaara saunpi jaanch kar rahe hogen, unke tabadale se pehle lokapal ke saath bhi baatcheet kii jaaegi

 Regarding hosting of Modi in future, Jamia spokesperson Mukesh Ranjan said, "we have received a reply from the PMO that the Prime Minister will not be able to visit the university due to lack of time
" isliye, hamane govardhan mehta ko aamantrit kiya he jinhone apni rajamandi di he jiske baad hamane uchit taarikh par faisla kiya
 Ranjan said that the university has nothing to do with the protest of the alumni and is hopeful of hosting Modi sometime in the near future

 It is said that when love goes beyond limits, it becomes a passion
 ek aisa junun jisamen insaan jaan le bhi saktaa he or jaan de bhi saktaa he
 One such example of obsessive love was seen in Raigad, Maharashtra
 jahaan ek mahila pulicekarmi ke ishk main giraftaar ek police vaale ne duusare police ko hi maar daalaa tha
 The incident which took place in the bike was like a blast that happened in the district headquarters of Raigad

 His motorcycle was parked in the headquarters parking lot

 After the accident, police started investigating

 The rajamala uncovered in the investigation looked like a terrorist incident

 And when the investigation came to light, everyone was shocked
 police ke adhikari sakate main aa gaye jab unhen pataa chalaa ki is vaardaat ko anjaam dene vaala or koi nahin balki ek police vaala hi tha
 Ishq became a passion, the fact was solved, and it turned out that obsessive love was the reason behind this incident
 yah maamla ek pulisavaali or do police waalon ke bich pyaar kaa tha
 The constable posted at the police headquarters, Nikesh Patil, had a love affair with a female policeman, his colleague
 ek doosraa sipaahi prahlaad patil bhi usee mahila police karmi ko had se zyada pyaar karata tha
 However, the woman policeman used to call her only friend

 The enmity between the two was increasing

 He is now jailed on charges of conspiring and committing murder
 desh main bhale chaahe jitani pareshaani ho, hamaare netaaon ko koi pareshaani nahin he
 They are comfortable wearing nice clothes, their suitcases seem like new
 chashma bhi mahangaa hi hota he, is dal se tikat nahin miltaa he to us dal se le aate hai
 You keep arguing on democracy, people who are not in any struggle take advantage of all your struggles, do not appear on any street and buy tickets to the party comfortably
 jab bhi aap netaaon kii taraf dekhenge to khud par hi shaq hone lagegaa ki khwamkhaah hameen pareshaan hai

 One and a half times the cost is not being received, announcement is being made, assurance is being given
 pension maang rahe hai mil nahin rahaa he
 They are not asking for market arrangements
 karz maafee maangate hai jiskaa elaan to hota he magar milti nahin he
 The result of the peaceful rally was that the government had accepted most of the demands
 30 june 2017 tak ke karz maaf honge
 You may remember that the debt waiver was announced on 24 June 2017 in Maharashtra
 dedh lakh tak ke krishi karz ke maaf kiye jane kaa elaan kiya gaya tha
 It was claimed that 89 lakh farmers would benefit
 rajya sarkaar ke khajaane par 34,000 karod kaa boj padegaa
 But people from the ground say that not everyone has received loan waiver yet
 ab ek nayaa elaan hua he ki 30 june 2017 tak ke karz maaf honge
 Following the banner of All India Kisan Mahasabha, these farmers have completed their journey and have re-impressed the government that they can return again if they forget the earlier promise
 dobaaraa bhul jane par tibaara laut sakate hai
 Today came to Mumbai on 9 March, with the movements discussed by the state government
 jo unki maangen thim unamem se kareeb kareeb sari maangen manzur kii thi
 More than 90 percent were landless tribals
 unki maang thi unhen van zamin kaa patta milanaa chahie, sarkaar ne pahal lekar aashwaasan kiya he ki chah maheene main aise saare daavon ko manzur karenge
 They will be given all the land allowed in the law
 is baat ko maanya kiya he
 On December 15, 2006, 11 years ago, the Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers legislation was passed
 hua yah tha ki jo adivasee sadiyon se apni zamin par rahe the, unhen atikaramanakari ke rup main dekha jane laga tha
 The tribals living in the forest did not have rights over their own land and forest
 forest afasar samajhataa tha ki vahi jangal kaa maalik he, adivasee nahin
 After passing 11 years ago, a large number of tribals got land leases under this law
 maharashtra ke adivasee kisaan sansad ke paas kiye gaye apane kanoon ke hisaab se haq maang rahe hai
 Land has been found in Gadchiroli and Nandurbar as of 2006, but not in other districts
 11 saal pehle paas hue is kanoon kaa yah ricard he ki do hi zile main kuch dhang se lagu hua he, baaki zilon main haal bahut acha nahin he
 Can the Maharashtra government get tribal farmers their rights within six months
 isi 6 march 2018 kii hindu kii khabar he
 The Minister of Tribal Affairs, Government of India, directed the Chief Secretaries of the state that all claims made under the Forest Rights Act 2006 should be dealt with quickly
 is saal 30 janvari tak 20 rajyon main kareeb 1 lakh 40 hazaar daawey kiye gaye
 Of these, 64,328 or 46 percent of the land was identified
 madhya pradesh se sabase adhik daawa kiya gaya 27,275
 This was followed by Chhattisgarh 14,161, Odisha 5964 and Maharashtra 5748
 kisaanon ne board ke parikshaarthiyon kaa khyaal rakhaa
 They did not have problems in the morning, so they came to Mumbai by night
 badale main mumbai waalon ne bhi kisaanon kaa koob khyaal rakhaa
 Some brought tea, some brought food and some brought chappals
 agar yah badlaav he to acha he
 How long farmers will be ignored
 neerav modi hazaron karod lekar bhaag jaataa he magar kisaan dedh lakh ke karj ke liye faansee chadh jaataa he
 In every budget you will hear that the loan amount for farmers will be 10 lakh crore this time
 kya wo raashi unhen milti he
 You know that in this budget, the target of agricultural credit has been increased to 11 lakh crore from the previous year's 10 lakh crore
 pi sainath ne bibisi hindi se kaha he ki naabard kii 2017 kii sambhavit link credit plan ke tahat jitna karz diya gaya he uskaa 53 pratishat hissaa mumbai or uske upnagaron ko diya gaya he
 While in Mumbai, you can understand who is a farmer
 in dinon bank series ke dauraan saikadon bankeron ne hamen bataaya he ki kisaan jab karz lene aata he to use majaboor kiya jaataa he ki vah fasal beemaa bhi le or duusari beemaa polisy bhi le
 The insurance premium often exceeds the interest on its loan
 ab yah baat kai prakaar kii report main aa chuki he ki kisaanon ko bataae bagair unke karz se beemaa kii premium raashi le lee ja rahi he
 Farmers are getting anxious
 dilli yaa rajyon kii rajdhani se kiye ja rahe ek-ek vaade or daawey par unki nazar he
 Therefore, when the price of potato was not received as promised in UP, farmers threw potatoes on the streets of Lucknow
 aapako yaad hoga pichley saal april maheene main tamilnadu ke kisaan aae the
 There was a severe drought in a hundred years
 in kisaanon ne media or sarkaar kaa dhyaan khinchne ke liye kya kya nahin kiya
 Put lentils and rice on the road and eat it
 nange badan ho gaye, gale main aatmahatya karne vaale kisaanon kaa narmund lataka liya
 Till funeral
 iske baad bhi kisi par kuch asar nahin padaa
 They came back again with the same demands that one and a half times the cost should be paid, pension and loan waiver
 100 dinon tak pradarshan karne ke baad ye dilli se chennai laut gaye
 You must be thinking that those farmers have disappeared
 lekin nahin
 These farmers are on a march from Kanyakumari in Chennai to Chennai
 raste main padane vaale gaanvon main jate hai, kisaanon se milte hai, unhen apane mudde ke bare main samajhaate hai taaki kisaanon main jaagrukta faile
 Slept on the way
 in kisaanon ne abhi himmat nahin haari he
 Since March 1, 22 farmers have boarded a bus to villages in Tamil Nadu
 dilli ko khabar bhi nahin he
 These people stay in every district for three days
 abhi tak 4 zilon kaa daura kar chuke hai
 They will visit 32 districts of Tamil Nadu
 aapako yaad hoga pichley saal june ke maheene main 1 se 10 june tak kisaan madhya pradesh ke mandsaur main karz maafee or laagat kaa dedh guna hasil karne ke liye andolan kar rahe the
 We and you do not know about the recommendation of the Swaminathan Commission, but the farmer of India has come to know about the recommendation of the Swaminathan Commission
 aap laagat kaa dedh guna nahin dekar kisaanon ko bevakoof nahin bana sakate hai
 The great success of 2019 will be that the farmer will take one and a half times the cost
 jis tarah se wo har ladaai haarane ke baad laut rahaa he, usase yahi lagata he ki ek din vah yah daam le legaa
 With these demands, farmers agitated in Sikar, Rajasthan from 1 September 2017 to 13 September 2017
 yah andolan itnaa anushaasit tha or ahimsak tha ki isamen zile or aas-paas ke ve log bhi aa gaye jo kabhi kisaanon ke andolan main shariq nahin hue the
 Onions were not getting peanut prices, the cost went up
 akhil bhartiya kisaan sabha ne hi sikar main andolan taiyaar kiya tha
 Two former CPM mlas from Sikar, Amra Ram and Prema Ram are leading it
 is andolan main mahilaon kii bhagidaari purushon se zyaada thi
 Farmers were demanding that the ban on sale of calves be lifted
 aawaara pashuon kaa samaadhaan ho or 2017 main pashuon kii bikri par lagi pabandi kaa kanoon waapas hate
 They were also asking for a monthly pension of five thousand for a farmer of sixty years
 sikar ke kisaan andolan kii khubi yah thi ki isamen auto chaalak union, privet taxi union, ambulance vaale, aara mashin union ne bhi raily nikaali he yaa andolan ko samarthan diya he
 Everyone said that if the farmer does not have money, then his business is also affected
 tab sarkaar dabaav main ai or samjhauta kiya ki 50,000 tak kaa lone maaf hoga
 Farmers will get a Rs 2000 pension
 sarkaar ko laga ki kisaan bhul gaye
 Now we will not return again, but when the Rajasthan government budget was presented, the loan of all the farmers was not forgiven
 sirf sahakaarita sosayadi se lone lene vaale kisaanon kaa 50,000 kaa lone maaf hua
 Therefore, on 22 February 2018, the movement started again in Sikar and the slogan of Jaipur Chalo was given
 sikar, nagaur, jhunjhunu or kota se kisaan jaipur kii taraf badhane lage
 He was arrested but the government had to leave the peasant leaders
 samjhauta hua magar lagu hota nahin dekhakar kisaan phir se 1 may ko apane apane zila mukhyalayon kaa gheraav karne vaale hai
 If the farmers were not allowed to enter Jaipur, then the farmers have decided that they will not allow these ministers to enter the villages
 bihar ke kai zilon main makka kii kheti karne vaale kisaan pareshaan hai
 There is no grain in the maize crop
 kai ilaakon main makke main dana nahin aayaa he
 Farmers' money has sunk a lot
 pataa chal rahaa he ki unhen ghatiya beej bech diya gaya he
 According to Bihar's media report, 1732 acres of maize crops have not been covered
 jaagran or prabhaat khabar kii khabaron ke anusaar mokama main 500 acre main lagi fasal barbaad ho gai
 Farmers' capital has sunk
 kisaanon ne acchhee paidaavaar ke liye hibrid beej kharidi, jiske liye keemat chukaai 1500 rupee prati kilo
 The seed company claimed that 40 quintals of maize would be grown in one bigha
 kisaanon ko kuch haath nahin laga
 In a bigha, the farmers only spent 6000 rupees on the seed and wasted
 sarkaar ke mantri ne vidhansabha main kaha he ki kisaanon ke nuksaan kii bharpai kii jaaegi
 Farmers don't even know where to go and what to do if they are cheated by the seed companies
 unke vot lekar kapadaa or din raat party badalane vaale netaaon ko bhi pataa nahin rahata he ki ve in maamalon main awaz uthaaen
 You may remember that last year 21 farmers died of pesticides in Yavatmal, Maharashtra
 companiyon ke khilaaf kuch nahin hota he
 On March 6, the Agriculture Minister told the Lok Sabha that 272 farmers have died due to pesticides in Maharashtra in four years
 ye sarkari aankada he
 272 farmers died like this, if they were valued, the leaders themselves would have created a ruckus
 par kya aapane netaaon ko chintaa karte dekha he
 Therefore, whatever the crisis you are in, the leaders of our country are in fun
 ab waapas lautate hai mumbai aae kisaanon par
 Aparna Karthikeyan of newsmint has written a good article about how much damage is done when farmers come into any movement
 har din 30 se 35 kimi paidal chalane vaale in kisaanon ke bare main is tarah se bhi dekha janaa chahie
 Many times we do not take into account the cost of their performance
 ye wo kisaan he jo apane khet main khud kaam karte hai
 Staying away from the farm for a day is a loss for them
 andolankaaree jaanate hai ki waapas jaakar kai dinon tak bhookha rahanaa hoga
 Tamil Nadu farmers suffered losses ranging from Rs 20,000 to Rs 30,000 after the agitation
 kisaanon ke peeche unke jaanavar bhi biimaar pad jate hai
 There is no one to care for
 bahut se kisaan khetihar mazdoor hote hai
 If they do not earn a day, then their family will not spend
 bhukhe sona padegaa
 It is obvious that the government should think how long it will not pay one and a half times the cost of the crop, how long it will not give pension to the farmers, it has to be given today or tomorrow, it is better to give it
 tippaniyan Otherwise farmers have come to Mumbai, will start coming to Delhi tomorrow, will start coming to their respective state capitals
 bhartiya kisaan union ke netaa ne phone kiya tha ki ve bhi dilli aane vaale hai
 The demand of these farmers is also no different from the farmers of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh
 laagat kaa dedh guna diya jaae
 The report of Prof
 Ramesh Chandra Committee is applicable
 aatmahatya karne vaale kisaanon ke parijanon ke punarvaas kii rashtriya niti bane
 The existing insurance policy is not in the benefit of the farmers
 isse sirf beemaa company ko phayda ho rahaa he
 Farming should be excluded from the World Trade Organization
 ganne kaa bakaayaa bhugtan turant kiya jaae
 This is what is seen by seeing these demands
 yaa to krishi mantri log koi kaam nahin karte hai yaa phir ve itnaa kaam karte hai ki uske baad bhi samasyaayein khatm nahin hotin
 Farmers can neither buy Rajya Sabha tickets nor Lok Sabha seats
 wo na to dal badal sakate hai na hi kapade badal paa rahe hai
 One has to travel from Nashik to Mumbai
 180 kimi kii is yatra main kisaanon ne apni takalif ko phir se jiyaa hoga, phir se ve apni awaz or iraade ko dhar de paae honge
 When he comes to Mumbai to achieve all these successes, then the eyes of the cameras start falling on his foot ulcers
 laagat se dedh guna daam mil nahin rahaa he, elaan hi ho rahaa he, aashwaasan hi mil rahaa he
 Is not getting pension asking for
 bazaar kii vyavastha maang rahe hai wo ho nahin rahi
 The loan apologizes, which is announced but is not available
 shantipurna raily kaa nateeja yah niklaa ki sarkaar ne zyaadaatar maangen maan lee hai
 The loan will be waived till June 30, 2017
 aapako yaad hoga ki maharashtra main 24 june 2017 ko karj maafee kii ghoshnaa hui thi
 a waiver of agricultural loans up to one and a half lakhs was announced
 daawa tha ki 89 lakh kisaanon ko phayda hoga
 The state government coffers will incur a burden of 34,000 crores
 lekin zamin se log bataate hai ki abhi tak sabko karz maafee nahin mili he
 Now a new announcement has been made that the debt will be waived till June 30, 2017
 akhil bhartiya kisaan mahasabha ke binar chale in kisaanon ne apni yatra puri kar sarkaar par dobaaraa asar daalaa he ki pehle kaa vaada bhul jane par ve dobaaraa laut sakate hai
 If forgotten again, you can return to Tibet
 aaj 9 march ko mumbai main aayaa tha, andolanon ke saath rajya sarkaar ne charchaa kii
 Almost all of those demands were accepted
 90 pratishat se zyaada bhoomihin adivasee the
 Their demand was that they should get a forest land lease, the government took the initiative and assured that in six months all such claims will be approved
 kanoon main jitani zamin kii anumati he wo unhen di jaaegi
 It has been validated
 15 disambar 2006 yani 11 saal pehle anusuchit janajati or anya paramparaagat van nivasee kanoon paas hua tha
 What happened was that the tribals who had been on their land for centuries were being seen as encroachers
 jangal main rahane vaale adivaasiyon ko apni hi zamin or jangal par adhikaar nahin tha
 The forest officer believed that he is the owner of the forest, not the tribal
 11 saal pehle paas hone ke baad is kanoon ke tahat badi sankhya main adivaasiyon ko zamin ke patte mili hai
 The tribal farmers of Maharashtra are demanding their rights according to their law made before Parliament
 gatchiroli or nandurbaar main 2006 ke hisaab se zamin to mili he magar baaki zilon main nahin hua he
 This law, passed 11 years ago, has a record that it has been implemented in some way in two districts, the situation is not very good in other districts
 kya maharashtra sarkaar chah maheene ke bheetar adivasee kisaanon ko unka haq dilaa sakati he
 This is the Hindu news of March 6, 2018
 bharat sarkaar ke adivasee maamle ke mantri ne rajya ke mukhya sachivon ko nirdesh diya ki van adhikaar kanoon 2006 ke tahat jitne bhi daawey kiye gaye hai unhen jaldi niptaya jaae
 By January 30 this year, about 1 lakh 40 thousand claims were made in 20 states
 inamen se 64,328 yani 46 pratishat zamin kii pahchaan kar lee gai
 The highest claimed 27,275 from Madhya Pradesh
 iske baad chhattisgarh 14,161, orissa 5964 or maharashtra 5748
 The farmers took care of the board examiners
 unhen subah dikkat na ho isliye ve raat ko hi chal kar mumbai aa gaye
 In return, the people of Mumbai also took care of the farmers
 koi chaay lekar aayaa, koi khaanaa lekar to koi chappal lekar aa gaya
 If it is a change then it is good
 kab tak kisaanon ko andekha kiya jayega
 Nirav Modi runs away with thousands of crores but the farmer hangs himself for a loan of one and a half lakh
 har bajet main aap sunate honge ki kisaanon ke liye karz kii raashi is baar 10 lakh karod hogi
 Do they get that amount? aap jaanate hai ki is baar ke bajet main krishi rin kaa lakshya pichley saal ke 10 lakh karod se badhaakar 11 lakh karod kar diya gaya he
 p Sainath has told BBC Hindi that 53 per cent of the loan given under nabard's 2017 potential link credit plan has been given to Mumbai and its suburbs
 jabaki mumbai main koun kisaan he aap samaj sakate hai
 These days during the Bank Series, hundreds of bankers have told us that when a farmer comes to take a loan, he is forced to take crop insurance and other policies
 aksar beemaa kaa premium uske karz ke byaaz se zyaada ho jaataa he
 Now it has come in many types of reports that insurance premiums are being taken from their loans without telling the farmers
 kisaan besabr ho rahe hai
 He keeps an eye on every promise and claim being made from Delhi or the state capital
 isiilie jab upi main vaade ke hisaab se aalu ke daam nahin mili to kisaan lakhanu kii sadakon par aalu phenk aae
 You will remember that in April last year, farmers of Tamil Nadu came
 vahaan sau saal main sabase bheeshan sookhaa padaa tha
 What did these farmers not do to grab the attention of the media and the government
 sadak par daal chaaval rakhkar khaaya
 Naked body, hung the neck of farmers who committed suicide
 antim sanskaar tak kiya
 Even after this, nothing was affected
 ve dobaaraa aae unheen maangon ko lekar ki laagat kaa dedh guna daam mili, pension mili or karz maafee ho
 He returned from Chennai to Chennai after performing for 100 days
 aap soch rahe honge ki ve kisaan gaayab ho gaye hai
 But not
 ye kisaan tamilnadu ke kanyakumari se chennai tak ke march par hai
 Those on the way go to the villages, meet the farmers, explain to them about their issue so that awareness is spread among the farmers
 raste main hi sote hai
 These farmers have not given up yet
 1 march se 22 kisaan bas main savaar hokar tamilnadu ke gaanvon main gaye hai
 Delhi does not even have news
 ye log har zile main teen din tak rukate hai
 Have visited 4 districts so far
 ve tamilnadu ke 32 zilon main jaaenge
 You will remember that in the month of June last year, from 1 to 10 June, farmers were agitating in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh to get loan waiver and one and a half times the cost
 ham or aap swaminathan ayog kii sifarish ke bare main na jaane magar bharat kaa kisaan swaminathan ayog kii sifarish ke bare main jaan gaya he
 You cannot fool farmers by not giving one and a half times the cost
 2019 kii yahi badi kamyaabi hogi ki kisaan laagat kaa dedh guna le legaa
 The way he is returning after losing every battle, it seems from him that one day he will charge this price
 inhen maangon ko lekar kisaanon ne rajasthan ke sikar main 1 sitambar 2017 se 13 sitambar 2017 tak andolan kiya
 This movement was so disciplined and non-violent that it also attracted people from the district and surrounding areas who had never joined the farmers' movement
 pyaaz moongfalee ke daam nahin mil rahe the, laagat bad gai thi
 The All India Kisan Sabha had created a movement in Sikar
 sikar se sipiem ke do purv vidhayak amara ram or prema ram ise lead kar rahe hai
 The participation of women in this movement was more than men
 kisaan maang kar rahe the ki bachhadon kii bikri par roak hataai jaae
 Stray animals should be resolved and in 2017 the ban on the sale of animals should be withdrawn
 ye saath saal ke kisaan ke liye paanch hazaar kaa masik pension bhi maang rahe the
 The specialty of Sikar's peasant movement was that auto driver union, private taxi union, ambulance, Ara machine union have also taken out a rally or supported the movement
 sabakaa kahana tha ki kisaan ke paas paise nahin hai to unke vyapaar par bhi asar padataa he
 Then the government came under pressure and agreed that loan up to 50,000 would be waived
 kisaanon ko 2000 rupee pension milegaa
 The government felt that the farmers had forgotten
 ab dobaaraa nahin lautenge lekin jab rajasthan sarkaar kaa bajet pesh hua tab saare kisaanon kaa lone maaf nahin hua
 The loan of 50,000 was waived only for the farmers who took loan from the cooperative society
 lihaaza 22 farvari 2018 ko phir se sikar main andolan shuru hua or jaipur chalo kaa naaraa diya gaya
 From Sikar, Nagaur, Jhunjhunu and Kota, farmers started moving towards Jaipur
 inaki giraftaar hui magar sarkaar ko kisaan netaaon ko chhodana padaa
 The agreement was reached but the farmers are about to encircle their district headquarters again on 1 May
 jaipur main kisaanon ko nahin ghusane diya gaya to kisaanon ne tay kiya he ki ve in mantriyon ko gaanvon main nahin ghusane denge

 Then the government came under pressure and agreed that loan up to 50,000 would be waived

 madhya pradesh se sabase adhik daawa kiya gaya 27,275
 This was followed by Chhattisgarh 14,161, Odisha 5964 and Maharashtra 5748
 kisaanon ne board ke parikshaarthiyon kaa khyaal rakhaa
 They did not have problems in the morning, so they came to Mumbai by night
 badale main mumbai waalon ne bhi kisaanon kaa koob khyaal rakhaa
 Some brought tea, some brought food and some brought chappals
 agar yah badlaav he to acha he
 How long farmers will be ignored
 neerav modi hazaron karod lekar bhaag jaataa he magar kisaan dedh lakh ke karj ke liye faansee chadh jaataa he
 In every budget you will hear that the loan amount for farmers will be 10 lakh crore this time
 kya wo raashi unhen milti he
 You know that in this budget, the target of agricultural credit has been increased to 11 lakh crore from the previous year's 10 lakh crore
 pi sainath ne bibisi hindi se kaha he ki naabard kii 2017 kii sambhavit link credit plan ke tahat jitna karz diya gaya he uskaa 53 pratishat hissaa mumbai or uske upnagaron ko diya gaya he
 While in Mumbai, you can understand who is a farmer
 in dinon bank series ke dauraan saikadon bankeron ne hamen bataaya he ki kisaan jab karz lene aata he to use majaboor kiya jaataa he ki vah fasal beemaa bhi le or duusari beemaa polisy bhi le
 The insurance premium often exceeds the interest on its loan
 ab yah baat kai prakaar kii report main aa chuki he ki kisaanon ko bataae bagair unke karz se beemaa kii premium raashi le lee ja rahi he
 Farmers are getting anxious
 dilli yaa rajyon kii rajdhani se kiye ja rahe ek-ek vaade or daawey par unki nazar he
 Therefore, when the price of potato was not received as promised in UP, farmers threw potatoes on the streets of Lucknow
 aapako yaad hoga pichley saal april maheene main tamilnadu ke kisaan aae the
 There was a severe drought in a hundred years
 in kisaanon ne media or sarkaar kaa dhyaan khinchne ke liye kya kya nahin kiya
 Put lentils and rice on the road and eat it
 nange badan ho gaye, gale main aatmahatya karne vaale kisaanon kaa narmund lataka liya
 Till funeral
 iske baad bhi kisi par kuch asar nahin padaa
 They came back again with the same demands that one and a half times the cost should be paid, pension and loan waiver
 100 dinon tak pradarshan karne ke baad ye dilli se chennai laut gaye
 You must be thinking that those farmers have disappeared
 lekin nahin
 These farmers are on a march from Kanyakumari in Chennai to Chennai
 raste main padane vaale gaanvon main jate hai, kisaanon se milte hai, unhen apane mudde ke bare main samajhaate hai taaki kisaanon main jaagrukta faile
 Slept on the way
 in kisaanon ne abhi himmat nahin haari he
 Since March 1, 22 farmers have boarded a bus to villages in Tamil Nadu
 dilli ko khabar bhi nahin he
 These people stay in every district for three days
 abhi tak 4 zilon kaa daura kar chuke hai
 They will visit 32 districts of Tamil Nadu
 aapako yaad hoga pichley saal june ke maheene main 1 se 10 june tak kisaan madhya pradesh ke mandsaur main karz maafee or laagat kaa dedh guna hasil karne ke liye andolan kar rahe the
 We and you do not know about the recommendation of the Swaminathan Commission, but the farmer of India has come to know about the recommendation of the Swaminathan Commission
 aap laagat kaa dedh guna nahin dekar kisaanon ko bevakoof nahin bana sakate hai
 The great success of 2019 will be that the farmer will take one and a half times the cost
 jis tarah se wo har ladaai haarane ke baad laut rahaa he, usase yahi lagata he ki ek din vah yah daam le legaa
 With these demands, farmers agitated in Sikar, Rajasthan from 1 September 2017 to 13 September 2017
 yah andolan itnaa anushaasit tha or ahimsak tha ki isamen zile or aas-paas ke ve log bhi aa gaye jo kabhi kisaanon ke andolan main shariq nahin hue the
 Onions were not getting peanut prices, the cost went up
 akhil bhartiya kisaan sabha ne hi sikar main andolan taiyaar kiya tha
 Two former CPM mlas from Sikar, Amra Ram and Prema Ram are leading it
 is andolan main mahilaon kii bhagidaari purushon se zyaada thi
 Farmers were demanding that the ban on sale of calves be lifted
 aawaara pashuon kaa samaadhaan ho or 2017 main pashuon kii bikri par lagi pabandi kaa kanoon waapas hate
 They were also asking for a monthly pension of five thousand for a farmer of sixty years
 sikar ke kisaan andolan kii khubi yah thi ki isamen auto chaalak union, privet taxi union, ambulance vaale, aara mashin union ne bhi raily nikaali he yaa andolan ko samarthan diya he
 Everyone said that if the farmer does not have money, then his business is also affected
 tab sarkaar dabaav main ai or samjhauta kiya ki 50,000 tak kaa lone maaf hoga
 Farmers will get a Rs 2000 pension
 sarkaar ko laga ki kisaan bhul gaye
 Now we will not return again, but when the Rajasthan government budget was presented, the loan of all the farmers was not forgiven
 sirf sahakaarita sosayadi se lone lene vaale kisaanon kaa 50,000 kaa lone maaf hua
 Therefore, on 22 February 2018, the movement started again in Sikar and the slogan of Jaipur Chalo was given
 sikar, nagaur, jhunjhunu or kota se kisaan jaipur kii taraf badhane lage
 He was arrested but the government had to leave the peasant leaders
 samjhauta hua magar lagu hota nahin dekhakar kisaan phir se 1 may ko apane apane zila mukhyalayon kaa gheraav karne vaale hai
 If the farmers were not allowed to enter Jaipur, then the farmers have decided that they will not allow these ministers to enter the villages
 bihar ke kai zilon main makka kii kheti karne vaale kisaan pareshaan hai
 There is no grain in the maize crop
 kai ilaakon main makke main dana nahin aayaa he
 Farmers' money has sunk a lot
 pataa chal rahaa he ki unhen ghatiya beej bech diya gaya he
 According to Bihar's media report, 1732 acres of maize crops have not been covered
 jaagran or prabhaat khabar kii khabaron ke anusaar mokama main 500 acre main lagi fasal barbaad ho gai
 Farmers' capital has sunk
 kisaanon ne acchhee paidaavaar ke liye hibrid beej kharidi, jiske liye keemat chukaai 1500 rupee prati kilo
 The seed company claimed that 40 quintals of maize would be grown in one bigha
 kisaanon ko kuch haath nahin laga
 In a bigha, the farmers only spent 6000 rupees on the seed and wasted
 sarkaar ke mantri ne vidhansabha main kaha he ki kisaanon ke nuksaan kii bharpai kii jaaegi
 Farmers don't even know where to go and what to do if they are cheated by the seed companies
 unke vot lekar kapadaa or din raat party badalane vaale netaaon ko bhi pataa nahin rahata he ki ve in maamalon main awaz uthaaen
 You may remember that last year 21 farmers died of pesticides in Yavatmal, Maharashtra
 companiyon ke khilaaf kuch nahin hota he
 On March 6, the Agriculture Minister told the Lok Sabha that 272 farmers have died due to pesticides in Maharashtra in four years
 ye sarkari aankada he
 272 farmers died like this, if they were valued, the leaders themselves would have created a ruckus
 par kya aapane netaaon ko chintaa karte dekha he
 Therefore, whatever the crisis you are in, the leaders of our country are in fun
 ab waapas lautate hai mumbai aae kisaanon par
 Aparna Karthikeyan of newsmint has written a good article about how much damage is done when farmers come into any movement
 har din 30 se 35 kimi paidal chalane vaale in kisaanon ke bare main is tarah se bhi dekha janaa chahie
 Many times we do not take into account the cost of their performance
 ye wo kisaan he jo apane khet main khud kaam karte hai
 Staying away from the farm for a day is a loss for them
 andolankaaree jaanate hai ki waapas jaakar kai dinon tak bhookha rahanaa hoga
 Tamil Nadu farmers suffered losses ranging from Rs 20,000 to Rs 30,000 after the agitation
 kisaanon ke peeche unke jaanavar bhi biimaar pad jate hai
 There is no one to care for
 bahut se kisaan khetihar mazdoor hote hai
 If they do not earn a day, then their family will not spend
 bhukhe sona padegaa
 It is obvious that the government should think how long it will not pay one and a half times the cost of the crop, how long it will not give pension to the farmers, it has to be given today or tomorrow, it is better to give it
 tippaniyan Otherwise farmers have come to Mumbai, will start coming to Delhi tomorrow, will start coming to their respective state capitals
 bhartiya kisaan union ke netaa ne phone kiya tha ki ve bhi dilli aane vaale hai
 The demand of these farmers is also no different from the farmers of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh
 laagat kaa dedh guna diya jaae
 The report of Prof
 Ramesh Chandra Committee is applicable
 aatmahatya karne vaale kisaanon ke parijanon ke punarvaas kii rashtriya niti bane
 The existing insurance policy is not in the benefit of the farmers
 isse sirf beemaa company ko phayda ho rahaa he
 Farming should be excluded from the World Trade Organization
 ganne kaa bakaayaa bhugtan turant kiya jaae
 This is what is seen by seeing these demands
 yaa to krishi mantri log koi kaam nahin karte hai yaa phir ve itnaa kaam karte hai ki uske baad bhi samasyaayein khatm nahin hotin
 The farmers took care of the board examiners
 unhen subah dikkat na ho isliye ve raat ko hi chal kar mumbai aa gaye
 In return, the people of Mumbai also took care of the farmers
 koi chaay lekar aayaa, koi khaanaa lekar to koi chappal lekar aa gaya
 If it is a change then it is good
 kab tak kisaanon ko andekha kiya jayega
 Nirav Modi runs away with thousands of crores but the farmer hangs himself for a loan of one and a half lakh
 har bajet main aap sunate honge ki kisaanon ke liye karz kii raashi is baar 10 lakh karod hogi
 Do they get that amount? aap jaanate hai ki is baar ke bajet main krishi rin kaa lakshya pichley saal ke 10 lakh karod se badhaakar 11 lakh karod kar diya gaya he
 p Sainath has told BBC Hindi that 53 per cent of the loan given under nabard's 2017 potential link credit plan has been given to Mumbai and its suburbs
 jabaki mumbai main koun kisaan he aap samaj sakate hai
 These days during the Bank Series, hundreds of bankers have told us that when a farmer comes to take a loan, he is forced to take crop insurance and other policies
 aksar beemaa kaa premium uske karz ke byaaz se zyaada ho jaataa he
 Now it has come in many types of reports that insurance premiums are being taken from their loans without telling the farmers
 kisaan besabr ho rahe hai
 He keeps an eye on every promise and claim being made from Delhi or the state capital
 isiilie jab upi main vaade ke hisaab se aalu ke daam nahin mili to kisaan lakhanu kii sadakon par aalu phenk aae
 You will remember that in April last year, farmers of Tamil Nadu came
 vahaan sau saal main sabase bheeshan sookhaa padaa tha
 What did these farmers not do to grab the attention of the media and the government
 sadak par daal chaaval rakhkar khaaya
 Naked body, hung the neck of farmers who committed suicide
 antim sanskaar tak kiya
 Even after this, nothing was affected
 ve dobaaraa aae unheen maangon ko lekar ki laagat kaa dedh guna daam mili, pension mili or karz maafee ho
 He returned from Chennai to Chennai after performing for 100 days
 aap soch rahe honge ki ve kisaan gaayab ho gaye hai
 But not
 ye kisaan tamilnadu ke kanyakumari se chennai tak ke march par hai
 Those on the way go to the villages, meet the farmers, explain to them about their issue so that awareness is spread among the farmers
 raste main hi sote hai
 These farmers have not given up yet
 1 march se 22 kisaan bas main savaar hokar tamilnadu ke gaanvon main gaye hai
 Delhi does not even have news
 ye log har zile main teen din tak rukate hai
 Have visited 4 districts so far
 ve tamilnadu ke 32 zilon main jaaenge
 You will remember that in the month of June last year, from 1 to 10 June, farmers were agitating in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh to get loan waiver and one and a half times the cost
 ham or aap swaminathan ayog kii sifarish ke bare main na jaane magar bharat kaa kisaan swaminathan ayog kii sifarish ke bare main jaan gaya he
 You cannot fool farmers by not giving one and a half times the cost
 2019 kii yahi badi kamyaabi hogi ki kisaan laagat kaa dedh guna le legaa
 The way he is returning after losing every battle, it seems from him that one day he will charge this price
 inhen maangon ko lekar kisaanon ne rajasthan ke sikar main 1 sitambar 2017 se 13 sitambar 2017 tak andolan kiya
 This movement was so disciplined and non-violent that it also attracted people from the district and surrounding areas who had never joined the farmers' movement
 pyaaz moongfalee ke daam nahin mil rahe the, laagat bad gai thi
 The All India Kisan Sabha had created a movement in Sikar
 sikar se sipiem ke do purv vidhayak amara ram or prema ram ise lead kar rahe hai
 The participation of women in this movement was more than men
 kisaan maang kar rahe the ki bachhadon kii bikri par roak hataai jaae
 Stray animals should be resolved and in 2017 the ban on the sale of animals should be withdrawn
 ye saath saal ke kisaan ke liye paanch hazaar kaa masik pension bhi maang rahe the
 The specialty of Sikar's peasant movement was that auto driver union, private taxi union, ambulance, Ara machine union have also taken out a rally or supported the movement
 sabakaa kahana tha ki kisaan ke paas paise nahin hai to unke vyapaar par bhi asar padataa he
 Then the government came under pressure and agreed that loan up to 50,000 would be waived
 kisaanon ko 2000 rupee pension milegaa
 The government felt that the farmers had forgotten
 ab dobaaraa nahin lautenge lekin jab rajasthan sarkaar kaa bajet pesh hua tab saare kisaanon kaa lone maaf nahin hua
 The loan of 50,000 was waived only for the farmers who took loan from the cooperative society
 lihaaza 22 farvari 2018 ko phir se sikar main andolan shuru hua or jaipur chalo kaa naaraa diya gaya
 From Sikar, Nagaur, Jhunjhunu and Kota, farmers started moving towards Jaipur
 inaki giraftaar hui magar sarkaar ko kisaan netaaon ko chhodana padaa
 The agreement was reached but the farmers are about to encircle their district headquarters again on 1 May
 jaipur main kisaanon ko nahin ghusane diya gaya to kisaanon ne tay kiya he ki ve in mantriyon ko gaanvon main nahin ghusane denge
 Farmers cultivating maize in many districts of Bihar are upset
 makke kii fasal main dana hi nahin aayaa he
 There is no grain in maize in many areas
 kisaanon kaa paisa kaaphi dub gaya he
 It is learned that they have been sold substandard seeds
 bihar kii media kii report ke anusaar 1732 acre main makke kii fasal main dana nahin aayaa he
 According to the news of Jagran and Prabhat Khabar, 500 acres of crop in Mokama was destroyed
 kisaanon kii puunji dub gai he
 Farmers bought hybrid seeds for good yield, for which the price paid was Rs 1500 per kg
 beej company ne daawa kiya tha ki ek bighas main 40 quintal makka ugega
 The farmers did not touch anything
 ek bighas main beej par hi kisaanon ke 6000 rupee lag gaye or barbaad ho gaye
 The government minister has said in the assembly that the losses of the farmers will be compensated
 beej companiyon se dhokhaa khaane par kisaanon ko bhi pataa nahin rahata ki kahaan jaaen, kya karen
 Even leaders who change their cloth and party day and night by taking their votes do not know that they should raise their voice in these matters
 aapako yaad hoga ki pichley saal maharashtra ke yavatmal main kitnashak se 21 kisaanon kii maut ho gai thi
 Nothing happens against companies
 isi 6 march ko krishi mantri ne loksabhaa main bataaya ki chaar saal main maharashtra main kitnashak se 272 kisaanon kii maut hui he
 This is the official data
 272 kisaan aise hi mar gaye, unki keemat hoti to netaa khud hi hangaamaa karte
 But have you seen leaders worrying? isiilie aap jitne bhi sankat main hon, hamaare desh ke netaa mouj main hai
 Now let's return to the farmers who came to Mumbai
 newalminute kii aparnaa kartikeyan ne ek acha lekh likhaa he ki jab kisaan kisi andolan main aate hai to peeche kitna nuksaan hota he
 This should also be seen about these farmers walking 30 to 35 km every day
 ham kai baar unke pradarshan kii laagat kaa dhyaan nahin rakhte hai
 This is the farmer who works on his own farm
 khet se ek din bhi dur rahanaa unke liye ghate kaa sauda he
 The agitators know that they will have to go back and starve for several days
 tamilnadu ke kisaanon ko andolan ke baad 20 hazaar se lekar 30,000 rupee tak kaa ghaataa hua
 Their animals also fall ill after the farmers
 dekhbhaal karne vaala koi nahin hota he
 Many farmers are agricultural laborers
 ve ek din nahin kamaayenge to unke parivaar kaa kharch nahin chalegaa
 Will have to sleep hungry
 zaahir he sarkaar ko sochna chahie ki kab tak fasal kii laagat kaa dedh guna nahin denge, kab tak kisaanon ko pension nahin denge, aaj na kal dena hi hoga, behatar he de diya jaae
 The comments varna kisaan mumbai aae hai, kal dilli aane lagenge, apane apane rajyon kii rajdhaniyon main aane lagenge
 The leader of the Indian farmer union had called that they too are coming to Delhi
 in kisaanon kii maang bhi maharashtra, tamilnadu, madhya pradesh ke kisaanon se alag nahin he
 One and a half times the cost
 pro ramesh chandra cameti kii report lagu ho
 National policy to rehabilitate families of farmers who committed suicide was made
 maujuuda beemaa policy kisaanon ke phaayde main nahin he
 Only the insurance company is benefiting from this
 kheti ko vishwa vyapaar sanghathan se baahar kiya jaae
 Sugarcane dues should be paid immediately
 in maangon ko dekhakar yahi lagata he
 Either the Agriculture Minister does not do any work or he does so much work that even after that the problems do not end
 agar yah badlaav he to acha he
 How long farmers will be ignored
 neerav modi hazaron karod lekar bhaag jaataa he magar kisaan dedh lakh ke karj ke liye faansee chadh jaataa he
 In every budget you will hear that the loan amount for farmers will be 10 lakh crore this time
 kya wo raashi unhen milti he
 You know that in this budget, the target of agricultural credit has been increased to 11 lakh crore from the previous year's 10 lakh crore
 pi sainath ne bibisi hindi se kaha he ki naabard kii 2017 kii sambhavit link credit plan ke tahat jitna karz diya gaya he uskaa 53 pratishat hissaa mumbai or uske upnagaron ko diya gaya he
 While in Mumbai, you can understand who is a farmer
 in dinon bank series ke dauraan saikadon bankeron ne hamen bataaya he ki kisaan jab karz lene aata he to use majaboor kiya jaataa he ki vah fasal beemaa bhi le or duusari beemaa polisy bhi le
 The insurance premium often exceeds the interest on its loan
 ab yah baat kai prakaar kii report main aa chuki he ki kisaanon ko bataae bagair unke karz se beemaa kii premium raashi le lee ja rahi he
 Farmers are getting anxious
 dilli yaa rajyon kii rajdhani se kiye ja rahe ek-ek vaade or daawey par unki nazar he
 Therefore, when the price of potato was not received as promised in UP, farmers threw potatoes on the streets of Lucknow
 aapako yaad hoga pichley saal april maheene main tamilnadu ke kisaan aae the
 There was a severe drought in a hundred years
 in kisaanon ne media or sarkaar kaa dhyaan khinchne ke liye kya kya nahin kiya
 Put lentils and rice on the road and eat it
 nange badan ho gaye, gale main aatmahatya karne vaale kisaanon kaa narmund lataka liya
 Till funeral
 iske baad bhi kisi par kuch asar nahin padaa
 They came back again with the same demands that one and a half times the cost should be paid, pension and loan waiver
 100 dinon tak pradarshan karne ke baad ye dilli se chennai laut gaye
 You must be thinking that those farmers have disappeared
 lekin nahin
 These farmers are on a march from Kanyakumari in Chennai to Chennai
 raste main padane vaale gaanvon main jate hai, kisaanon se milte hai, unhen apane mudde ke bare main samajhaate hai taaki kisaanon main jaagrukta faile
 Slept on the way
 in kisaanon ne abhi himmat nahin haari he
 Since March 1, 22 farmers have boarded a bus to villages in Tamil Nadu
 dilli ko khabar bhi nahin he
 These people stay in every district for three days
 abhi tak 4 zilon kaa daura kar chuke hai
 They will visit 32 districts of Tamil Nadu
 aapako yaad hoga pichley saal june ke maheene main 1 se 10 june tak kisaan madhya pradesh ke mandsaur main karz maafee or laagat kaa dedh guna hasil karne ke liye andolan kar rahe the
 We and you do not know about the recommendation of the Swaminathan Commission, but the farmer of India has come to know about the recommendation of the Swaminathan Commission
 aap laagat kaa dedh guna nahin dekar kisaanon ko bevakoof nahin bana sakate hai
 The great success of 2019 will be that the farmer will take one and a half times the cost
 jis tarah se wo har ladaai haarane ke baad laut rahaa he, usase yahi lagata he ki ek din vah yah daam le legaa

 In a bigha, the farmers only spent 6000 rupees on the seed and wasted
 sarkaar ke mantri ne vidhansabha main kaha he ki kisaanon ke nuksaan kii bharpai kii jaaegi
 Farmers don't even know where to go and what to do if they are cheated by the seed companies
 unke vot lekar kapadaa or din raat party badalane vaale netaaon ko bhi pataa nahin rahata he ki ve in maamalon main awaz uthaaen
 You may remember that last year 21 farmers died of pesticides in Yavatmal, Maharashtra
 companiyon ke khilaaf kuch nahin hota he
 On March 6, the Agriculture Minister told the Lok Sabha that 272 farmers have died due to pesticides in Maharashtra in four years
 ye sarkari aankada he
 272 farmers died like this, if they were valued, the leaders themselves would have created a ruckus
 par kya aapane netaaon ko chintaa karte dekha he
 Therefore, whatever the crisis you are in, the leaders of our country are in fun
 ab waapas lautate hai mumbai aae kisaanon par
 Aparna Karthikeyan of newsmint has written a good article about how much damage is done when farmers come into any movement
 har din 30 se 35 kimi paidal chalane vaale in kisaanon ke bare main is tarah se bhi dekha janaa chahie
 Many times we do not take into account the cost of their performance
 ye wo kisaan he jo apane khet main khud kaam karte hai
 Staying away from the farm for a day is a loss for them
 andolankaaree jaanate hai ki waapas jaakar kai dinon tak bhookha rahanaa hoga
 Tamil Nadu farmers suffered losses ranging from Rs 20,000 to Rs 30,000 after the agitation
 kisaanon ke peeche unke jaanavar bhi biimaar pad jate hai
 There is no one to care for
 bahut se kisaan khetihar mazdoor hote hai
 If they do not earn a day, then their family will not spend
 bhukhe sona padegaa
 It is obvious that the government should think how long it will not pay one and a half times the cost of the crop, how long it will not give pension to the farmers, it has to be given today or tomorrow, it is better to give it
 tippaniyan Otherwise farmers have come to Mumbai, will start coming to Delhi tomorrow, will start coming to their respective state capitals
 bhartiya kisaan union ke netaa ne phone kiya tha ki ve bhi dilli aane vaale hai
 The demand of these farmers is also no different from the farmers of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh

 The existing insurance policy is not in the benefit of the farmers
 isse sirf beemaa company ko phayda ho rahaa he
 Farming should be excluded from the World Trade Organization
 ganne kaa bakaayaa bhugtan turant kiya jaae
 This is what is seen by seeing these demands
 yaa to krishi mantri log koi kaam nahin karte hai yaa phir ve itnaa kaam karte hai ki uske baad bhi samasyaayein khatm nahin hotin
 You will remember that in the month of June last year, from 1 to 10 June, farmers were agitating in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh to get loan waiver and one and a half times the cost
 ham or aap swaminathan ayog kii sifarish ke bare main na jaane magar bharat kaa kisaan swaminathan ayog kii sifarish ke bare main jaan gaya he
 You cannot fool farmers by not giving one and a half times the cost

 sabakaa kahana tha ki kisaan ke paas paise nahin hai to unke vyapaar par bhi asar padataa he
 Then the government came under pressure and agreed that loan up to 50,000 would be waived
 kisaanon ko 2000 rupee pension milegaa
 The government felt that the farmers had forgotten
 ab dobaaraa nahin lautenge lekin jab rajasthan sarkaar kaa bajet pesh hua tab saare kisaanon kaa lone maaf nahin hua
 The loan of 50,000 was waived only for the farmers who took loan from the cooperative society

 From Sikar, Nagaur, Jhunjhunu and Kota, farmers started moving towards Jaipur

 The helicopter is reported to be of the Hindustan Aeronautics Academy
 bataaya ja rahaa he ye helicopter train payalat uda rahe the, tabhi choper kaa ingine fail ho gaya, jiske baad ek imaarat kii chat par helicopter ko surakshit utaara gaya
 There were two pilots in this helicopter

 Due to the lack of cash on the Bengali Durga Puja due to the economic downturn, the pressure of 20-40 percent reduction in reduced ad budget Durga Puja is the biggest festival of Bengal which is celebrated with great pomp
 lekin aisa lag rahaa he ki desh main chai aarthik mandi ne is tyohaar kii chamak feeki kar di he
 Pooja organizers are under the influence of the recession, as corporate advertisers have reduced advertisements due to lack of cash
 puja aayojakon kaa kahana he ki korporate praayojakon kii kami ke chalate ham par dabaav he ki ham apane bajet main 20 se 40 fisadi tak katautee karen
 Sayendeb Chakraborty, secretary of Hajra Park Durgotsav Committee in South Kolkata, says, "every year, by this time the vacancies outside the puja pandal were filled with advertisements, but this year there is not a single advertisement
 hamane har cheez main katautee kii he, kyonki companiyaan vigyaapan par kharch karne kii icchhuk nahin hai, jabaki vigyaapan hi hamaare liye paise kaa mukhya strot tha
 According to Chakraborty, for the large-scale Durga Puja events, the planning and budgeting of the next year was done as soon as the last year's puja was over
 puja aayojakon ke liye kalakaaron ko jutanaa, saaj-sajja karana, nai theme chunanaa kaaphi mushkil kaam hota he, taaki zyada se zyada bheed ko aakarshith kiya ja sake
 For this, the money you get from the unorganized sector is mostly in advance and in cash
 lekin is baar kalakaaron or vendoron ko dar sata rahaa he ki unhen nuksaan hoga
 Arun Pal, the idol creator, said, 'pooja committees book idols, then make some payments in advance and when we deliver the idol, we get full money
 aamtaur par ham murtiyon banane ke liye karj lete hai or paise aane par waapas kar dete hai
 This time we are afraid whether the worship organizers will pay us on time
 'sponcers ko sata rahaa darmukhyamantri mamata banerjee ke kshetra bhavanipur ke ek puja pandal main taiyaariyon kii nigaraanee kar rahe kuch varisht logon ne bataaya ki puja kharch par iskar vibhaag kii nigaraanee ke chalate zyaadaatar sponcers ko dar sata rahaa he
 Ashish Sengupta, executive president of Abshar Sarbojneen Durgotsav Samiti said, “any fear of income tax is just gossip, no pooja committee is going to pay income tax
 iskar vibhaag ne yah spasht kiya he
 Nevertheless, it has become a perception among people which has influenced sponsors
 'asocham kii 2013 kii report ke mutabik, pashchim bengal main durga puja kii kul arthvyavastha 25,000 karod kii thi
 It was expected that it would grow at a rate of 35 per cent every year
 bade bajet ke saath puja aayojak bheed ko aakarshith karne par dhyaan kendrit karte hai taaki vigyaapan dene vaale brands ko zyada se zyada phayda ho, lekin khapat main giravat ke chalate maang main kami ai he
 With this, organized sector companies have reduced the advertising expenses during the festive season
 8000 binar kii booking, mila he 2000 kaa orderoutdoor edvertising agency chalaane vaale ratul biswas kaa kahana he, 'jo clients vigyaapan par 50 se 60 lakh kharch karte the, ve ab mahaj 10 lakh kharch kar rahe hai
 We have to book the ad space in advance of the client's order
 hamane puraa kolkata main advance main 8000 binar kii jagah kii booking kara lee he, lekin abhi tak sirf 2000 kaa order mila he
 With just three weeks left in Durga Puja, it is beyond our imagination
 automobile, real estate or fast mowing kanjumar guds (FMCG) sector sabase kharaab haalat main he
 Due to lack of funding, the organizers are making changes in the promotional system at the last moment
 iskaa matlab yah bhi he ki udghaatan ke liye badi shakhsiyaten nahin bulaai jaaengi
 a Pooja Committee member said, 'honestly, this time Maa Durga will save us!' To help Durga Puja committees, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has announced to give Rs 25,000 to each of the 28000 committees of the entire state
 sarkari madad main pichley saal ke mukaable yah 150 fisadi kii badhat he
 Senior Trinamool Congress leader Madan Mitra said, 'the country's economy is counting the last breath due to the wrong policies of the Modi government
 aise main mujhe andeh he ki puja samitiyaan paanch dinon ke liye dhang se puja yogic kara sakengi
 At the same time, BJP leader Shishir Bajoria denied any economic downturn, saying that Pooja committees are being politicized due to which people have stopped giving donations for worship
 'unhone kaha, 'pehle puja ke liye sthaneey logon se fund jutaaye jate the or kabhi fund kii kami nahin hoti thi
 Then gradually the involvement of chit funds came to light, but now that too has ended
 trinmul ke netaa or mantri puja ko paisa ugaahne ke racket ke liye istemaal karte hai
 It has nothing to do with the state's economy
 ' Navratri is celebrated twice a year
 pehla caitra maas main, jise caitra navaratri kehete hai or doosraa asina maas main, jise sharadiya navaratri kehete hai
 During Navratri, nine different forms of Goddess Durga are worshiped for nine days
 asina maas main manaae jane vaale navaratri main dasven din vijaydashami yani dashahra tyohaar ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 But have you ever thought that Dussehra Day is celebrated on the tenth day of Kinnavratri? We are telling you the same here
 
 
 navaratri main bhuulakar bhi naa karen ye galtiyaan, maa ho jaati hai narazkaise hui thi sharadiyanvaraatri kii shuruyataisi manyata he ki sharadiyanvaraatri kii shuruyatbhagwan ram ne kii thi
 Lord Rama first started the worship of the Shardian Navaratras along the seashore
 ram ne lagaataar 9 dinon tak shakti kii puja kii thi or tab jaakar unhone lanka par jeet hasil kii thi
 This is the reason why Dasha Maharamna is performed on the tenth day after worshiping Durga Maa for nine days in the Shardiya Navaratras
 har saal 10wein din tab se hidashahramnaaya jaataa he or mana jaataa he ki adharm kii dharm par jeet, asaty kii satya par jeet ke liye 10wein dinadshahramnaate hai

 Scientists said that they feared that after this, the speed with which he was coming down, he hit the moon's surface at the same speed
 chunki, lander bich-bich main chand ke chakkar laga rahe orbitor se conect ho rahaa he, isliye isro vaigyanikon ko ab bhi ummid he ki lander se sampark sthapit ho jayega
 Vikram Lander was supposed to come from the red line, but that path was lost

 By the way, let me tell that i was out of the country in Malaysia
 lekin main 15-20 dinon ke liye india ai hui thi
 Then i got a call for wild card entry
 
 
 (bich main kaat kar) jisane bhi bulaayaa
 
 main aapako bataa rahi hum na
 
 aap mujhe bolne kaa to mauka den
 You will also ask questions, you will also answer, so why did you call me here? That is why you called acting good
 (tahaakaa) acting nahin kar rahi hum main
 i am enjoying, how much fun i am having with you
 aap bade achche or jolly hai
 You are laughing a lot here, while in the Bigg Boss house, some people call you a militant and some call it ill-tempered
 to kya vahaan yah sab aapkaa nakli rup tha?nahin-nahin aisa nahin tha
 Was there a fixed rate that the more you fight, the more money you will get? Lets talk, how do you talk
 aap jane koun-sa najariya nikaal lete hai
 It doesn't happen like that
 main doli bindra, ek abhinetri hum
 My job is to act
 aap agar mujhe apane sho main bulaayenge to kisalie bulaayenge?manoranjan ke liye
 Would you call me for entertainment? i am not a social worker and will work for free
 paise to luungi na? bas baat yaheen khatm ho jaati he
 Yes, but what did they call you? Now they know why they called me? i am a senior artist
 ab unhone kya dikhaaya, vah aapane dekha
 Yes, you did not show what you did 24 hours, otherwise you do not know what happens
 nahin, nahin, aisi koi baat nahin
 According to me, everything i had seen before i went there is actually there
 agar kuch or baat hoti to main sabase pehle bolti, kyonki meri jabaan to koi band nahin kar saktaa, chaahe kuch bhi ho jaae
 i always follow the truth main sirf sachaai kii baaten hi nahin karti hum
 i do what she says
 izzat do to izzat lo
 Live and live, don't disturb
 (gaanaa gaati hai) aapas main prem karo mere deshpramiyo
 While talking about love, Dhishum - Dhishum had started
 vahaan logon ne mere liye, ek akeli ablaa ke liye aisa maahaul bana diya tha, vahaan mujhe alag-thalag kar diya gaya
 That house is very terrible
 yah sho reality kaa baap he
 i would like to tell you why i accepted it
 big bos itane saalon se dekhati aa rahi hum
 The show seems quite entertaining
 prabhu ji yahaan prastutakarta hai
 If Prabhu ji is invited to Bigg Boss house, we will see you laughing and playing, treating you with love
 logon se majaak-masti karte rahenge
 There will be real God
 aapane acchhee baat kahi ki jo asaliyat he, vah vahaan jaakar pataa lag jaati he
 So Dolly Bindra who is inside and outside, she was the same? Or was there something else inside? No, not the same
 darasal halaat kuch aise ho gaye the
 i think you are not as bad as you were shown there
 yaa aapane acting kii thi vahaan?nahin, acting to main karti nahin hum
 i also work in films myself
 main to filmon main bhi script nahin padhati hum
 Your character is shown in Big Boss that a woman quarrels, is willing to mess with everyone, who keeps looking for an excuse to fight
 unhone aapako iske liye koi script de di thi?main uske bare main aapse koi baat hi nahin karnaa chaahati kyonki is baat kaa koi mahatv hi nahin he
 This is a reality show
 main yah anubhav lene gai thi ki agar main vahaan tik gai to main jindagi main kahin bhi tik sakati hum
 Without a phone, without a newspaper
 aapaki rojaanaa kii jivan style vahaan nahin hoti
 You are always on camera
 par mujhe yah samaj main nahin aayaa ki log mujhe itnaa galat kyon samajhte hai
 i came into focus more
 haa, kyon ain?maine jab cliping dekhi to khud hairaan rah gai
 i feel very sad shweta tiwari aise lard rahi thim jaise khali pahalawaanon se kushti ladate hai
 Ever since i moved there, there was a feeling of insecurity in Shweta
 sabhi mere khilaaf ho gaye the
 i was completely alone
 main ek baat jarur kangi ki is ghar main rahane kaa apana alag anubhav he
 The same saying applies to this that if you marry, you repent, or even if you don't, you regret it
 lekin anubhav jarur lenaa chahie
 There i have been out of control many times
 aap jeetne ke liye andar gai thim na?main sach bataati hum ki main jeetne ke liye nahin, balki masti karne gai thi
 There was no motive to win
 big bos ke ghar main alag-alag saamaajik, aarthik prishthbhumi ke log hai
 Some belong to rich households, some to poor
 kya aapako lagata he ki is vajah se kuch khaas tarah ke log ek group bana lete hai?maine isaki parvaah nahin kii ki koun kaisaa he
 i went there as a guest
 agar vahaan logon ko meraa swabhaav pasand nahin he to meri galati nahin he
 If he liked my food, that was all right
 jab main hansatii-bolti thi to thik tha
 But when he spoke something on his wrong things, he was not well
 phir aapako kyon nikaal diya?dekhie kaayade-kanoon unke apane hote hai
 Because of your wrong behavior? They did what they thought was right
 mujhe jo thik laga, vah maine kiya
 Was his decision justified? i have no qualms
 mujhe koi dukh nahin he ki mujhe kyon nikaala gaya
 What did you learn there Did you learn the art of fighting or not? i learned not to make friends, but not to love people
 lekin big bos main to log pyaar hi kar rahe the
 Were obscene
 meraa matlab ek insaan or duusare insaan ke bich pyaar se he
 You stayed in Big Boss for four weeks, did you think that the people there are real? Only one is true, the rest is fake
 sirf khali sachche hai, baaki sab nakli hai
 Bigg Boss Show is being talked about at 11 pm due to obscenity
 log maryaada kii rekha paar kar jate hai
 You also used the language many times

 Let people see reality in it

 yuvaraj singh ke karodon cricket premiyon ko zankrut kar dene vaale karishme kii naav par savaar bharat ne guuruuvaar ko vishwa cap ke duusare quarter final main australia ko paanch wicket se chit karke semifinal main pakistan se romaanchak, dilachasp or kade mukaable kii neenv rakhi
 Yuvraj became the team's savior for the third time in this World Cup
 is baar unke bemisaal pradarshan se bharat jahaan 27 saal baad vishwa champion banane se do match kii duuri par pahunch gaya vahiin riki ponting kaa captain ke rup main khitaab kii hetric puure karne kaa sapana bhi chakanachur kar diya
 India was also rewarded for bowling better than in previous matches as Australia managed to score only 260 for six despite Ponting's 104-run strategic innings scoring only 102 runs in the league stage, the flat pitch of Motera's Sardar Patel Stadium But there was not a big goal
 sachin tendulkar ke 53 or gautam gambhir ke 50 ran ke baavjood jab bharat kaa score paanch wicket par 187 ran tha to match par donon tiimon kaa palada baraabar lag rahaa tha
 However, Yuvraj, who took two wickets for 44 runs in ten overs in the Australian innings, made a difference between the two teams
 unhone 65 gend par aath chaukon kii madad se naabad 57 ran banaaye or suresh raina :naabad 34: ke saath 74 ran kii atoot saajhedaari kii jisase 1983 ke champion bharat 47
 Scored 261 runs for five wickets in 4 overs
 ab nigahen 30 march ko mohali par tiki rahengi jahaan final se pehle final khelaa jayega kyonki muqabla do kattar pratidwandviyon bharat or pakistan ke bich hoga
 Pakistan thrashed the West Indies by ten wickets in the first quarter-final yesterday
 bharat 1983, 1987, 1996 or 2003 ke baad paanchavin baar semifinal main pahunchaa he
 It is also a coincidence that in 1983, India had stopped the title campaign of the two-time champions West Indies, whereas now the Indian team forced Australia to return homeless
 ghutane kii chot se ubarkar vaapasi karne vaale virendra sahvaag :22 gend par 15 ran: shuru se hi asahaj dikh rahe the
 The Australian referral of the catch was dismissed by the umpire on the back of a wicket in the first over of Betray Lee against him but he was caught at square leg on the rising ball of Shane Watson as a second change
 tab bharat kaa score 44 ran tha
 Tendulkar dominated the game from the start
 unhone shaan tait ke pehle over main do chauke jadne ke baad mishael janson or watasan kii gendon ko bhi seemaa rekha paar bheja
 Tendulkar, who completed 18,000 runs in One Day, however returned to the pavilion before completing his century on Motera
 tait kii gudleyngth gend unke balle ko chumkar hadin ke dastaanon main samaa gayi
 He played 68 balls and hit seven fours
 gambhir :50 ran: or viraat kohli : 33 gend par 24 ran : ne iske baad ek do ran lekar australia par dabaav banane kii koshish kii
 Both were leading the innings well with a couple of runs but Kohli gave his wicket in reward by playing a wrong shot on the fullback of David Hussey
 behtareen farm main chal rahe yuvaraj ne isi over main chaukaa jadkar apana khaataa kholaa
 He produced a good sample of his paddle sweep but was run out by his mistake after completing a serious half-century at the other end
 tab yuvaraj therdman par gend khelkar apni jagah par khadey rahe jabaki gambhir aadhi pich tak daud gayi or is tarah se unki pari 64 gend tak simit rahi jisamen do chauke shaamil hai
 Yuvraj sent a wicket of Tait in the air for four runs and then Brett Lee's third man and a four in the cover gave him confidence
 unke ek shaat ko rokane ke prayaas main lee chotil bhi ho gayi jinke powerple ke pehle over main raina ne pari kaa pehla chakka jadaa
 Yuvraj lured the audience with a winning boundary over Lee
 isse pehle australian pari main ponting ne ankar kii bhoomika nibhaai
 He meanwhile shared a 70-run second wicket stand with Brad Haddin (53) and a 55-run partnership for the sixth wicket with David Hussey (34 not out)
 dhoni ne chennai superkings ke apane turup ke ikke aswin ko nayi gend saunpi or unhone shen watasan :25: ko bold karke australia par dabaav banaakar coach gairi karston kii salaah par puri tarah se amal kiya
 Dhoni also made frequent changes in bowling and even got Tendulkar and Kohli bowled
 tendulkar ne van de main 2009 ke baad pehali baar gend sanbhali
 Harbhajan Singh, who performed well against Australia, was put on the attack in the ninth over
 unhone pehle spel ke chah over main 18 ran diye lekin aakhir ke chaar over main 32 ran lutaa gayi
 But Ponting came to the crease with full commitment
 lachar farm ke kaaran media ke nishane rahe ponting ne tab ankar kii bhoomika nibhaakar jaandaar pari kheli jabaki duusare chor se wicket gir rahe the
 In the middle, when he looked to flow his innings, Zaheer Zaheer's charismatic slow ball uprooted Michael Hussey's off-stump, forcing him to play again
 ponting ne yuvaraj ke dasven over main extra cover par chakka or phir chaukaa jamaakar unka gendbaaji vishleshan bigaadane kii koshish kii
 Yuvraj took two wickets for 44 runs
 jahir ne haalanki naye ballebaaj camerun white : 12 : ko bhi adhik der nahin tikne diya or jinhone waapas gendbaaj ko aasaan kaich thamaya
 Australia took the batting powerplay in the 44th over and scored 44 runs in these five overs
 ponting ne is bich van de main apana 30waan or vishwa cap main paanchvaan shatak puraa kiya
 He returned to the pavilion soon after with a reverse shot on Ashwin and caught in the short third man field

 During a press meeting recently, Dhanush spoke about the fees of actors
 unhone kaha tha, aaj ke daur main actors ke liye puri fees paanaa bahut durlabh ho gaya he
 But in my film Asuran, Thanu sir has set my salary before shooting

 On his statement, Asuran's producer Kalapalli Phanu said that Dhanush has also sacrificed several crores for the release of his films
 haalanki dhanush ne kisi produsar kaa naam nahin liya tha, lekin unke is bayaan ke baad al ajahagappan or ke
 Filmmakers like Rajan are quite upset
 ajahagappan ne ek website se kaha, vijay or ajit jaise actors producers kii madad karte hai
 But those who invested money in Dhanush's films have failed in this business
 ve is field se ab gaayab hi ho chuke hai

 Producers make films with private loans

 china ne bharat ko ek baar phir dhamkee di he
 China has said that if India did not withdraw its army from Doklam, war would be fought
 itnaa hi nahin china ne ise aakhri chetavanee bataaya he
 The editor of the Chinese government newspaper Global Times issued this warning via video message
 unhone kaha ki nai dilli sabase bure vakt kii taiyaari nahin kar rahaa he
 He has also said that the security agencies are not telling the truth to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and keeping him in the dark
 'nehru jaisi naadaani na karen'is sandesh main global times ke sampadak hu jigin ne 1962 ke yuddh kaa bhi zikr kiya he
 He said, "what Nadani Nehru did in 62 is what India is doing today
" ''pehali baar piem modi kaa namchin ne pehali baar pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa naam lete hue yuddh kii dhamkee di he
 Government newspaper Global Times has said that India's security agencies are keeping Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the dark about their capabilities
 ye he puraa sandesh
 
 
 Government newspaper Global Times has said that India is still doing the same foolishness that Nehru did in 1962
 akhbaar ne sidhe taur par kaha he ki bharat kii suraksha agenciyaan apni kshamtaaon ko lekar pradhanmantri narendra modi ko andhere main rakh rahi hai
 Instead of preparing for the worst, New Delhi is learning to expect good from its citizens
 kya bharat sarkaar us carch kii tarah he jo prarthana kii aguwai kar rahaa ho? agar bharat china kii chetavanee ko nazarandaaj karata rahaa to yuddh hokar rahegaa
 If India's security agencies continue to seduce Narendra Modi, it will be difficult to avoid war
 iskaa matlab bharat itnaa saahsee ho gaya he ki china kii chetavanee ko tavajjo hi na de
 In 1962, Nehru thought that China would not attack
 bharat aaj bhi utana hi nadaan he
 India is an amazing country
 -hu jijinmukhya sampadak, global timeschin or bhutan ke bich vivaadit kshetra he dokalamchin or bhutan ke bich doklam ek vivaadit kshetra he
 India and Bhutan consider it a Bhutanese territory

 China's road construction work was stopped by Indian troops citing no decision on ownership over Doklam
 unhone kaha ki bharat ke liye sainya adhikariyon ko chini kshetra main bhejnaa avaidh he
 Be it Bhutan's security concerns or under the guise of protection
 bharat ne apni karrwai ke sambandh main koi kanoonee aadhaar pradaan nahin kiya he
 ' bainkon ke atm kaa baar-baar istemaal november se mahangaa pad saktaa he
 The Reserve Bank has decided to limit the free use of atms in six metros
 aap chaahe rupee nikaalen yaa keval khate kii jaankaree len, tay sankhya se zyada istemaal par 20 rupee kaa shulk dena hoga
 The atms of another bank in the six metros of the country will be used free of charge only three times in a month, while only five transactions can be done from their bank atms
 isse adhik istemaal par graahakon ko har baar 20 rupee shulk chukaana hoga
 This new system of withdrawing money from atms will be implemented in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Kolkata and Hyderabad from November
 bainkon ke sanghathan bhartiya bank sangh (ibie) ne iske liye rigerv bank ko gyaapan bheja tha
 In the notification issued by the Reserve Bank, the number of free transactions has been reduced essentially from the existing five to three per month for savings account holders using atms of other banks
 isamen vittiya or gaiyr-vittiya donon tarah ke lenden shaamil hai
 This arrangement will be applicable at atms located in six metros of the country
 rigerv bank ne haalanki yah bhi spasht kiya he ki nai vyavastha chote, no-frill, or basic bachat khaataa dharakon ke khaaton par lagu nahin hogi
 Apart from the six metros of the country, the new system will not be applicable in other cities

 Some were reading books, some were writing articles and were appreciated for their contribution in the fight for equality in their society
 lekin bharat main padhai-likhaai chhod kar, vichaar-vimarsh bhul kar, ve giraftaari se bachane kii koshish main lage hue hai
 a case of inciting violence was first registered against him, then his Maoist links were discovered, he was directly linked to the conspiracy to assassinate the Prime Minister, the court did not care if the police gave relief, he was arrested

 But Anand Teltumbde is still not safe
 adaalatein ek had tak hi unki madad kar sakati hai
 If it wants power, it can find many more ways to suppress and oppress them
 bharat main pulisavaalon ko maaloom he ki kisi ko tang karne ke kitne kanoonee raste hua karte hai
 Anand Teltumbde is not alone
 unke saath or bhi log hai jo yah saare aarope jhel rahe hai
 It can be said that when you go out for resistance to power, you should also be ready for its results

 Pak Shahera Fahmida Riyaz, who had recently passed, had to remain inundation for seven years
 is daur main unhone hindustan ko apana ghar banaaya
 So the list of writers-intellectuals who have been tortured at the hands of power is very long
 kehane kii zarurat nahin ki loktantric azaadi or manushya kii asmita ke paksh main chale sangharsh main unka yogadan bahut bada he
 But why should this situation come before any writer or intellectual in India? The Indian state of the nation had developed a mind of its own in the struggle for independence
 yah samaj bahut saafe thi ki bharat chaahe jitani bhi samasyaayein bhugte, vah apane nagarikon kii azaadi or garima banaae rakhega
 The freedom to speak in Indian democracy is the result of this thinking and understanding
 apatkaal is niyam main ek apwaad kii tarah aayaa jisaki sazaa indira gandhi ko bhugatni padi
 The intellectuals of the country also understood that to maintain their independence, it may have to be fought and beaten
 in dinon sarkaar kii aalochana se dukhi bahut saare log yah sawaal uthaate dikhte hai ki kya ham kisi or desh main- masalan, china yaa pakistan main- itani azaadi ke saath apni baat rakh sakate hai? ve bhul jate hai ki yah azaadi kisi sarkaar kii di hui nahin he, bhartiya janata kii kamai hui he or isaki tulana kisi ne nahin ho sakati
 The truth is that in many democratic countries of the world, the level of freedom of the press is better than India
 baharhaal, anand teltumbade par lauten
 Recently, he was upset reading his poignant appeal
 yah lagata rahaa ki is desh kaa aam naagarik kitna bebas he
 How easily can governments crush it
 sambhav he, anand teltumbade bahut krantikari yaa jujharu tabiyat ke shaks na hon jaise hamaare bahut saare saathi nahin hai
 Neither is the author of these lines
 lekin kai tarah ke anyaayon se bindha unka apana jivan ek swaabhaavik pratirodh rachataa he
 His consciousness of these injustices compels him to write and speak
 unhen ek samuhik yaa santhnik ladaai uchit or zaruri lagati he
 Power is afraid of this consciousness
 vah anand teltumbade jaise logon ko sabase khataranaak maanati he
 Because they say their words very sincerely and their words impact
 lekin yah sirf anand teltumbade ko dabaane kaa maamla nahin he, yah dusron ko daraane kii bhi koshish he- yah bataane kii ki agar ve satta ke kilaaf bolenge to unako isaki sazaa bhugatni padegi
 But whether it is fearful or fearless, it has to be resisted
 varanaa ek lekhak ke taur par hamaara koi mol nahin bachaa rahegaa
 The author eventually has to stand against the power and the rights of the weak - this understanding has been there for those who write for centuries
 to is lekhak kii kuch dari, kuch dabi hui awaz ko bhi anand teltumbade ke paksh main kii ja rahi apil kii tarah dekha-mana jaae
 Anand and writers like them can be safe, can move freely in the world of reading and writing, this will only enrich our intellectual and political society and as a country we will be stronger

 co / lpkvotei9f— Sushma Swaraj (@sushmaswaraj)july 10, 2016 Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is a smartphone that you can use more than a smartphone
 kaaphi sambhaavnaaen hai
 This is a Note series and in the given s Pen, the company has added many new features this time, which is groundbreaking
 phone kii disple shandaar he or philhal isse better disple vaale smartphone aapako shaayad market main na milen
 In this review, you will read about the Galaxy Note 10+ from the technicality that a common man wants to know while buying a phone
 hamaara ye rivyuu hamaare readers ke liye he, taaki wo phone kharidne se pehle ye samaj saken ki phone asal jindagi main kaam kaise karata he
 You will get many reviews, in which you will get to see so much technicality that you can hold your head by seeing it
 baharhaal ye rahaa sabase bharosemand rivyuu – Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ kaa
 Design and Build Quality i have used the Galaxy Note 10 Plus as a primary phone for some time
 is phone main diya gaya styles yani s Pen vaaki behtareen he
 Through air gestures, you can remotely control your phone in many ways
 photose swip karne hon yaa camera actevet karnaa ho in sab ke liye es pen yuj kar sakate hai
 The Galaxy Note 10 is impressive in terms of design and build quality
 phone kii disple kaaphi badi he, phone powerful he or bydaree bhi badi he, lekin phir bhi ye phone baari nahin he
 The front will have a punchhole only for the screen and selfie camera
 bejals na ke baraabar hai
 But a little chin is definitely given
 Galaxy Note 10 kii body solid he or ye apni keemat ko justiphi karti he
 It can be placed at number-1 in premium Android smartphones
 rier panel kii baat karen to camera placement acha he
 Nowadays companies offer good cameras, but due to camera placement, the entire back design gets spoiled
 Galaxy Note 10 ke saath aisa bilkul nahin he
 Camera placement is correct and next to it is dual LED flash
 ek haath se phone yuj karnaa mushkil he, kyonki phone kii disple kaaphi badi he or ye note siries kii khaasiyat bhi he
 Display Note 6 of Galaxy Note 10 Plus
 8 inch kii AMOLED he
 The screen is HDR10 + rated
 asal jindagi main ye disple aapako kaaphi pasand aane vaali he
 Samsung's display in premium smartphones has not been the answer since long ago
 brit, colorphul, fluid – yaa phir vuing angal kii baat kar len ye disple har tarah se prabhavit karti he
 Gaming, videos, photos or videography, in every case, you see real colors in its display
 is OLED panel ko vivid mod main chalaayenge to jaahir he behatar rigelt milegaa
 i liked the Note 10+ screen better than the iphone XS Max
 Galaxy Note 10 Plus camera parformansis smartphone main chaar rier camere die gaye hai
 Three are in one module and the fourth camera is in the middle of the flash
 inamen se ek wide angel lens he or is baar company ne ultra wide camera bhi diya he
 The wide angle camera is amazing
 frem main kaaphi chijen ek saath aati hai, tamaam chijen cover hoti hai
 In terms of ultra wide, the company has done much better, but when it comes to the overall camera experience, it does not meet the expectation
 aisa nahin he ki iskaa camera kharaab yaa he isse tasviren acchhee nahin aati hai, lekin kuch kami he isamen
 Talking about camera setup, there is a 16 megapixel ultra wide, 12 megapixel wide angle, 12 megapixel telephoto and a depth vision camera in the rear for this
 selfi ke liye isamen 10 megapixl kaa panchhole camera diya gaya he
 The camera app is the same as the camera interface
 chunki is phone main es pen he to uske liye kuch nae fitures bhi hai
 As mentioned earlier, now you can control the camera with gesture control of s Pen
 fitures kii baat karen to yahaan slo mo, super slo mo, nite mod, hiplaps, live focus or food jaise mods die gaye hai
 Scene is also a feature of auto detection
 camera parformens kii baat karen to isamen kai fitures hai or acchhee photose clic hoti hai
 Live Focus works well and corrects background and foreground recognition
 haalanki isamen or bhi better karne kaa scope he
 The macro shots are excellent and so is the wide angle lens
 ye sabhi apana kaam sateek karte hai
 Clicked photos contain details, photos are sharp
 nite shot kii baat karen to Pixel 3 ke level kaa to nahin he, lekin thik thaak he
 Photos come in night mode also
 selfi camera kai logon ko pasand nahin aayaa, lekin mujhe isamen koi khaas dikkat nahin dikhi
 However, the beautifications given in it do the complete work of making the feature photos fake
 agar kisi ko photo kii thodi bhi samaj he to wo samaj jayega ki ye photo edited he yaa isamen effects die gaye hai
 Software based portrait mode has also been given for selfie camera
 kam roshni main bhi acchhee selfi clic kii ja sakati hai
 But there will be a lot of noise, which is the problem of all cameras
 selfi camera ke liye koi flash nahin he aapako screen kii lite par hi nirbhar karnaa hoga
 The Zoom In Mic feature also works well and distant sound is passed while recording video
 video recording kii baat karen to rier camere se aap 60 frem prati sencond kii rate se 4K record kar sakate hai
 There is a camera based feature that also works well
 kisi cheez ke majorment ke liye aap Quick Measure ap ko yuj kar sakate hai
 Samsung Galaxy Note + Performance is a expensive phone, is Samsung's flagship, is special for productivity, so people generally expect that there will be no compromise on the performance
 samsung ne aisa hi kiya he
 This is tremendous in terms of performance
 kaaphi fast he, smood he, multi tasking ke liye isse better abhi koi smartphone nahin he
 There is no problem in switching apps or loading apps
 phone lag yaa hang nahin karata he
 The company has already improved its Android-based custom user interface
 pabaji khilne kii koshish kii maine
 After half an hour the phone started heating up
 phir band kiya, phir se pabaji start 
 
 lekin afsos pabaji ke dauraan lagaataar phone garm hota he
 It should not happen
 haalanki duusare heavi eps ke saath kai eps yuj kar len phone garm nahin hota
 It is also not hot to watch videos
 spacifications kii baat karen to is smartphone main Exynos 9825 chipset he jo 7nm besd he
 This processor is considered to be special for performance
 maine jo divaais rivyuu kiya he isamen 8GB ram ke saath 256GB kii internal storage di gai he
 We do not go into much technicality, let us know that the performance of the phone is excellent and it will not disappoint you at all
 under disple fingerprint scinar ko or fast hona chahie
 i have used PIN most of the times, because it is not as fast
 company ko is taraf dhyaan dena chahie
 Battery backup: Its battery is 4300mah
 puure din kaa byaap aaraam se milegaa agar aap mixd yuj karte hai to
 Always on display, you can remove so much backup by using edge lighting
 heavi yuj karne par shaam hone tak bydaree khatm hone lagegi
 It has been supported with fast charging which is good
 wireles charging or power share kaa bhi feechar he
 If you have a smartphone or smart watch with wireless charging support, then you can charge it by placing it behind the phone
 iphone x ko charge karke test kiya he, charging zyada slo nahin he or thik thaak charge ho jaataa he
 Should you buy this phone? If budget allows, you can buy this phone
 sirf camera parformens ke liye phone kharid rahe hai to ye phone aapke liye nahin he
 If you want a phone with a good display, excellent performance and a good design, then this is for you

 rajasthan vidhansabha main buudhvaar ko hue abhootpurv hangaame ke baad adhyaksh kailash meghavaal ne anushaasanheenata ke aarope main congress ke baarah sadasyon samet 14 vidhayakon ko ek saal ke liye vidhansabha kii sadsyta se nilambit kar diya
 The suspended mlas include Congress's Govind Dotasara, Dheeraj Gurjar, Shakuntala Rawat, Ashok Chandna, Shravan Gurjar, Heera Lal, Sukhram Vishnoi, Mewa Ram, Ramesh Meena, Ghanshyam, Rajendra Singh, Bhajan Lal, Independent Hanuman Beniwal and bsp's Manoj Nyagali
 
 adhyaksh kailash meghavaal ne sarkari mukhya sachetak kaalu laal gurjar kii ore se sadan main anushaasanheenata ke liye in 14 vidhayakon ko sadan kii sadsyta se ek saal ke liye nilambit karne ke liye rakhe gaye prastaav ko dhvanimat se paarit karaayaa
 Rajpa's Dr
 kirodi laal meena or bhaajapa ke ghanashyam tibadi ne sarkari mukhya sachetak kii ore se rakhe gaye prastaav kaa virodh karte hue kuch bolnaa chaha lekin adhyaksh ne donon ko bolne kii anumati nahin di
 The comments adhyaksh meghavaal ne dukhi hote hue kaha ki pratipaksh ke kuch huddangi vidhayak sadan kii paramparaon, niyamon or asana ke nirdeshon kii paalna nahin kar sadan main anushaasanheenata kar rahe the
 What the members of the opposition did during the Question Hour on Wednesday was shameful
 adhyaksh ne kaha ki maine pratipaksh sadasyon ko bolne kaa puraa samay dekar galati kii ,lekin ab sadan main kisi ko anushaasanheenata nahin karne di jaaegi

 ) Speaker Kailash Meghwal passed a resolution on behalf of the Government Chief Whip Kalu Lal Gurjar to suspend these 14 mlas from the membership of the House for one year for indiscipline in the House
 rajpa ke dow
 Kirodi Lal Meena and bjp's Ghanshyam Tiwadi wanted to protest against the proposal put forward by the government chief whip but the Speaker did not allow both
 tippaniyan Speaker Meghwal said unhappily that some Hooddangi mlas of the opposition were doing indiscipline in the House by not following the traditions, rules and postures of the House
 buudhvaar ko prashnkaal ke dauraan pratipaksh ke sadasyon ne jo kuch kiya vah sharmnaak tha
 The Speaker said that i made a mistake by giving the opposition members full time to speak, but now no one will be allowed to indiscriminate in the House

 ) kendriya mantri arun jetali kaa mangalvaar ko america ke neuyork main oparation hua he
 After which Jaitley has been advised rest for two weeks
 tab tak ke liye arun jetali se vitt mantralay kaa jimmaa le liya gaya he or rail mantri piyush goyal ko atirikt prabhaar diya gaya he
 It is expected that Piyush Goyal will present the last budget of the tenure of the Modi government
 66 varshiya arun jetali 13 janvari ko america gaye the
 Sources said that he was tested for 'soft tissue' cancer this week
 haalanki, is dauraan bhi jetali soshal media par sakriy rahe
 Apart from writing posts on Facebook, he also tweeted on current issues
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle pichley saal 14 may ko jetali kaa ames main gurda pratyaropan hua tha, uske baad se vah videsh nahin gaye the
 In the same month, Arun Jaitley was made the bjp's campaign head for the upcoming general election
 bina portpholio ke mantri honge arun jetaliis dauraan arun jetali mantri pad par barkaraar rahenge, lekin unke paas koi portpholio nahin hoga
 Let me tell you that even before when Arun Jaitley was admitted in the hospital, Piyush Goyal also took charge of the Finance Ministry
 arun jetali pichley saal gurda pratyaropan ke baad 23 agast ko kaam par laut aae the or unhone vitt or corporate mantralayon kii jimmedaari phir sambhaal lee thi
 Let us tell you that Jaitley has the responsibility of the Finance Ministry since the Narendra Modi government came to power
 14 may, 2018 se 23 agast, 2018 tak vah bina portpholio ke mantri rah chuke hai
 Apart from this, Arun Jaitley has held the responsibility of Ministry of Defense, Corporate Ministries

 isse pehle videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj bhi apana ilaaj kara chuki hai, haalanki pichley kaaphi samay se vah apni jimmedaari sambhaal rahi hai
 The ex-wife of pakistani-american terrorist David Coleman Headley claims that he tried to stop the 2008 Mumbai attack, but he was ignored by the US authorities
 do baar bharat kii yatra kar chuki hedli kii duusari patni, faija autalla ne ek televijan ke saath baatcheet main kaha he ki videsh main america adhikariyon se milakar usne 2008 ke mumbai hamale ko rokane kii koshish kii thi, lekin unhone is par dhyaan hi nahin diya
 WLS-TV / DT of Chicago quoted Autalla as saying, "that's why i went to him and started giving him information
" maine kaha ki vah har cheez ko bam se udaane ja rahaa he, vah ek apradhi he
