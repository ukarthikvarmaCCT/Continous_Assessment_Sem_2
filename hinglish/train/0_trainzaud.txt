 In the Rajya Sabha, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad raised the issue of a class-specific and mob attack on Dalits, and even in the states, the Congress got ready to surround the BJP government on this issue
 ab is mudde par bhopal ke yuvaaon ne pradhanmantri modi ke naam chitthee likh kar apana virodh darj karaayaa he
 Youngsters thumb their blood on the letter
 madhya pradesh congress ke pravaktaa abbaas hafeez ne is muhim kii shuruyaat kii
 The protesters say that since Narendra Modi has become prime minister again, incidents of mobocracy have become common in the country and the silence of the BJP government boosts the morale of such people
 pradarshan kii aguai kar rahe congress ke pradesh pravaktaa abbaas hafeez kehete hai, ''bheedtantr main shaamil log bhaajapa kii vichaardhaara ke samarthak hote hai or wo alpsankhyak evam dalit samudaay ke khun ke pyaase hai
 "there is political self-interest behind these incidents," says Abbas, but if this attack does not stop, the country's Ganga Jamuni Tehzeeb will suffer a great loss
 'bhopal ke yuvaaon kaa kahana he ki vah is muhim ko puure desh main le jaaenge
 He also hoped that after this letter, Prime Minister Modi will show strictness towards the accused of the incidents
 is mudde par congress netaa durgesh sharma kaa kahana he ki congress sabhi tarah kii deshvirohi gatividhiyon kaa virodh karti rahi he or karti rahegi
 There will not be any mobilization in the country
 *** After talks between Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav, Nitish has not spoken to anyone
 mana ja rahaa he ki tejasvi yadav ne apni safai main jo kuch kaha hoga usase wo santusht nahin hai
 Therefore, it is being said from JDU that it is still standing on the old stand
 matlab saaf he ki tejasvi yadav ko apni sampatti ke bare main binduvaar jaankaree bihar kii janata ko dena chahie
 Now it is up to Tejashwi Yadav to decide how he will give his cleaning
 tejasvi or nitish ke bich mangalvaar ko cabinet baithak ke baad kareeb 45 minute tak baatcheet hui
 Tejashwi Yadav clarified the allegations leveled against him and said that the CBI has framed him
 saath hi vah court main iske khilaaf jaaenge or agrim jamaanat ke saath-saath cese main poochtacha ke khilaaf bhi apil karenge
 But it seems Nitish Kumar is not satisfied with his answer, only then he has not spoken to anyone after this conversation
 is bich tejasvi yadav aaj dilli ja rahe hai
 He is believed to be going to Delhi to seek legal advice
 halaki iske alaava bhi kai atakalein lag rahi hai
 According to the information received from the meeting, Nitish Kumar had said that the CBI has registered a case after the investigation and it is not the subject of the state, therefore, he should not seek a scavenging cleanliness but the people of Bihar will have to be clarified
 baithak main tejasvi ko yah bhi yaad dilaayaa gaya ki mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar banate samay yah tay hua tha ki bhrashtachar se koi samjhauta nahin hoga

 japan ne bharat ke saath urja, krishi or dawaaon ke kshetra main behatar sambandhon par jor dete hue ravivaar ko kaha ki asia ke ye do majboot raashtra aapas main aarthik sahyog badhaakar chamatkaar kar sakate hai
 The Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, said in a meeting held with the Chambers of Commerce and Industry here today that the two countries have great potential to increase economic cooperation
 vaanijya evam udyog mandalon asocham, siaiai or fikki kii baithak main ebe ne kaha 'majboot bharat or majboot japan donon saath ho sakate hai or meraa maananaa he ki ham aisa karke chamatkaar kar sakate hai 
 
 mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki donon deshon ke bich sahyog ke liye vyapak sambhaavnaayen maujuud hai
 ' japan ke pradhanmantri kal hone ja rahi ganatantr diwas kii parade main mukhya atithi honge
 He said that his delegation included entrepreneurs from various industrial sectors
 isamen ucch praudyogiki companiyon ke udhyami bhi shaamil he or unke paas bharat ke samaksh peshkash ke liye kaaphi kuch he
 Abe said 'it is not that only India needs Japan
 
 Japan also needs India
 
 
 japan ko maanav sansaadhan kii aavashyaktaa he jo ki aapke paas he or meraa aapse aagrah he ki aap jaapan kii yatra par aaiye or swayan us praudyogiki ko dekhen jo japan aapako pesh kar saktaa he
 ' unhone kaha ki dawaaon ke alaava japan ke paas krishi kshetra se judi praudyogiki bhi he jisamen donon deshon ke bich gathbandhan kii sambhaavnaayen hai
 In the energy sector, Japan has competent technology that can reduce carbon dioxide emissions
 donon deshon ke bich varsh 2011 main vyapak mukt vyapaar samjhauta lagu ho chukaa he

 rajasthan mantrimandal ne gurjaron ke alaava banjaaraa, gadriya, gadibia lohaar or rabari jatiyon ke liye vishesh pichhadaa varg kii nai shrenee banaakar paanch fisadi atirikt kota dene kaa faisla kar ek aisa siyaasi daanv chalaa he jo isse pehle tamaam rajyon main munh kii kha chukaa he
 Except Tamil Nadu, no other state in the country has more than 50 percent reservation
 rajasthan ne jo daanv ab chalaa he, use 2001 main jharkhand or 2004 ke baad se kai baar andhra pradesh main chalaaya ja chukaa he
 But both the states repeatedly had to be defeated in court
 lekin ab 50 fisadi aarakshan vaale rajyon kii qatari main tamilnadu or chhattisgarh ke saath rajasthan bhi khadaa ho gaya he
 Constitutional expert Subhash Kashyap tells India Today, "crossing the limit of 50 per cent is not law and constitution compliant
 lekin tamilnadu ne samvidhan sanshodhan ke jariye aarakshan kii seemaa 50 ke paar kii he
 It has put the reservation in the ninth schedule, while Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh have not done so and some comments can be made only by studying it
 ’’kashyap kii tippanee us avasarwaad kii raajnneeti kii ore bhi ishaara he kyonki rajyon main vot bank ke hisaab se sarkarein cabinet kii baithak main faisle kar leti hai, jo nyaayik samiksha ke aage aundhe munh gir jaataa he
 Kashyap argues that the limit cannot be exceeded without constitutional amendment
 "if the reservation is more than 50 per cent, then its basic sentiment is lost
" ’’rajasthan main aarakshan kii seemaa paar karne kaa yah koi pehla mauka nahin he
 On November 28, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot recommended that a special reservation of five per cent be given to Gurjars and four other castes through a cabinet decision
 lekin aisa karne se kul aarakshan 54 fisadi ho jaataa he
 Earlier, the bjp's Vasundhara government had fixed 14 percent reservation for the economically backward along with 5 percent for the Gurjars, raising the reservation limit to 68 percent
 lekin ab gahalot sarkaar ne raaje ke nirdhaarit gurjar varg ke saath aarthik rup se pichde virgon ke liye 14 fisadi aarakshan or anya vishesh cote ko alag kar diya he
 He has said to set up a separate commission for the economically backward classes
 jabaki chhattisgarh kii raman singh sarkaar ne to centre sarkaar ke paanch saal puraane notification kii aad main siyaasi daanv khelte hue
 The reservation of tribals was increased from 20 to 32 percent
 apane is kadam se mukhyamantri raman singh ne rajya main baar-baar uthne vaali adivasee siem banane kii maang kii dhar ko bhothari karne kii koshish kii
 But with this the reservation limit was reduced to 58 percent
 jise hycourt main chunauti di gai or ste lagate hi raman sarkaar kii saansen phool gayi, kyonki purana kanoon khatm ho chukaa tha
 In this way, reservation in recruitment in state jobs was ending, after which the court filled the interim relief on the government's application
 vaise singh kii daleel he, ‘‘jatiyon kii aabaadi ke mutabik aarakshan tay kiya gaya he, jiske liye hamane vidhansabha main kanoon banaaya
 The Supreme Court's decision on crossing the 50 per cent limit is unclear
 ’’raman singh ne jaateey aabaadi ko aadhaar banaaya, lekin sawaal uthta he ki agar unhone centre ke noticecation par amal karne main paanch saal kaa intjaar kiya to jaateey janaganana kii report kaa intjaar kyon nahin kiya? aakhir jaateey gananaa kii report se tasviir saaf hoti or tab zyada taarkik tareeke se aarakshan kii nai seemaa tay kii ja sakati thi
 It is clear that the interest of governments has become more connected to social justice
 gahalot bhi singh jaisi hi daleel de rahe hai
 He says, "the Supreme Court has said in the Indira Sawhney case that reservation under special circumstances can cross the 50 per cent limit and the Israni Commission has recommended in this context
 jise hamane maan liya he
 "but Prashant Bhushan, a senior advocate of the Supreme Court, denies the reservation limit being exceeded even in Tamil Nadu
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘koi rajya aisa nahin kar saktaa
 You have to study how Rajasthan or other states did it
 ’’supreme court kii hi ek anya varisht vakil kamalesh jain bhi 50 fisadi kii seemaa paar karne ko asanvaidhanik tehraati hai, lekin unka maananaa he, ‘‘vidhayika chaahe to is seemaa ko badha sakati he, basharte yah anuchit, anyaaypurna or manamaana nahin hona chahie
 He argues that the judiciary also falls within the purview of the legislature
 shahbaano prakaran kii nazeer dete hue ve kahati hai, ‘‘supreme court ne mahila ko nyaay diya tha, lekin sansad ne kanoon banaakar us faisle ko palat diya or court kuch nahin kar paaya
 The judiciary is also helpless and has to work within the ambit of the legislature made by the legislature
 ’’lekin sawaal uthta he ki vishesh paristhitiyon ko sabit kaise kiya jayega
 The figures of castes in the country are from pre-independence to 1931 only
 vishesh paristhitiyon ko paribhaashit karne ke maamle main sabase bada jhatka jharkhand ko lag chukaa he
 In 2001, the Marandi government recommended the implementation of 73 per cent reservation as soon as a new state was created
 rajya sarkaar kaa tark tha ki jharkhand atyant pichhadaa rajya he, aise main vah 50 fisadi aarakshan kii adhiktam seemaa ko paar na karne kii bandish se aaazaad he
 But when the matter reached the Supreme Court, a backward state like Jharkhand was also forced to accept the reservation limit of 50 per cent

 Shammi Kapoor, who holds the highest rank in Bollywood in the all-time romantic actor category, is known as one of the brightest, most beautiful and bubbly heroes of Hindi films, who immortalized dozens of films with his memorable performances

 The Modi government, which came back to power, presented its first budget on 5 July
 vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne loksabhaa main qareeb do ghante kaa bajet bhaashan diya
 But this general budget came into discussion even before it was presented in Parliament
 vajah- us ataichi kaa nadaarad rahanaa jise saalon se sabhi sarkaron ke vitt mantri bajet ke din dikhaate nazar aate the
 The leather-gray briefcase was of great importance to televisiongoers and photographers
 lekin modi sarkaar khabaron main aisa chutilaapan laana jaanati he or jaahir he is baar ke bajet se se pehle bajet kii thili charchaa main ai
 There was a lot of discussion about this red bag on social media
 thodi hi der main yah twitor or google search main trend karne laga tha
 Sitharaman appeared outside the Parliament with a budget document resembling bookkeeping instead of a briefcase
 is bahikhaate par kalava jaisaa riban bandhaa tha or rashtriya pratik bana hua tha
 The reason for doing this was also given
 mukhya aarthik salaahkaar krishnamurthi subramanyan ne kaha ki ye bhartiya parampara he or ye pashchimi vichaaron kii gulaami se nikalne kaa pratik he
 It is not a budget but a bookkeeper
 asal main, bajet ko bag main laane kii parampara kai sadiyon puraani rahi he or jaahir he yah british parampara rahi he
 In 1733, when British Prime Minister and Finance Minister Robert Walpole came to present the budget, he had a leather bag in his hand
 is thile main hi bajet se jude dastavej the
 This leather bag was called Buzzet in French, on the basis of this process later came to be called Budget
 laal suutakes kaa istemaal pehali baar 1860 main british bajet chif wiliay gladstone ne kiya tha
 It was later also called the Gladstone Box and the UK budget continued to be presented in this bag
 lambey samay baad is bag kii sthiti kharaab hone ke baad 2010 main ise aadhikarik taur par ritair kiya gaya
 India gained independence from the British in 1947, but the tradition of the budget remained the same with the British

 K
 shanmukham chetty ne jab 26 janvari, 1947 ko pehali baar bajet pesh kiya to vah bhi ek chamade ke thile ke saath sansad pahunche
 After this, the budget continued to be presented with this tradition for many years
 1958 main yah parampara badali or pandit jawahar laal nehru ne kaale rang ke brifces main bajet pesh kiya
 After this, when the then Finance Minister Manmohan Singh presented the budget in 1991, the color of the briefcase was changed to red
 tab se hi laal brifces main bajet pesh kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Even the interim budget of 1 February 2019 was presented by Piyush Goyal in the red briefcase itself
 magar, is baar modi sarkaar ke duusare kaarykaal kaa pehla bajet lekar ain vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ke haath main laal brifces kii jagah bajet ke dastavej laal makhmali kapade main lipte najar aae
 This is the first time that both the leather bag and the briefcase have disappeared from the government's budget
 bajet kii is nai parampara ko bahi-khaataa bataaya ja rahaa he
 That is, the name given to the budget was given to the economic blueprint presented in leather bags and suitcases based on the word Buzzet in the French language

 dharmanagari pushkar ke bazaar main ghoomte samay yahaan dukaanon par koi ajanabi bhashaa likhi dikhe to chaunkiye mat
 It is Hebrew or Arabic language
 tamaam aise restaraan bhi hai, jahaan chaay pine jaaen to menu card par bhi yahi bhashaa milegi
 For the last five years, Pushkar has remained the main tourist destination of Israel
 ye puure saal bharat aate rahete hai
 From September to April, a large number of Israeli tourists have started living here
 guptchar vibhaag ko inkaa puraa record rakhana padataa he
 In 2012, 14,300 Israeli tourists visited Pushkar
 in payartkon kii badi sankhya ko dekhte hue hotel udyog ne bhi qamar kasi
 Even after preparing banners / cards in Hebrew and Arabic languages, they were called from Delhi to the cook to serve special food
 hebrew bolnaa sikh chuke paayal restaraan ke maalik kishan sharma ne apane yahaan jab se yahudee baavarachi bulaayaa he, vahaan har vakt paryatakon kii bheed lagi rahati he
 Ravi Rawat, owner of Om Siva Restaurant, happily chides, "israeli tourists know how to live
" ve kharch karne main kanjusee nahin karte
 Between his culture and food, he enjoys it even more
 29 varshiya nehorai ko hi lijie
 She comes to Pushkar every year
 unheen ke shabdon main, ''yahaan bada sukun miltaa he
 i especially love watching the setting sun here
 ” israel ke ek or sailaani danniel ko vaise yahaan garmi lagati he par yah jagah unhen pasand he
 After winters, these tourists go to Dharamshala or Manali in Himachal Pradesh in the summer
 israeli nagarikon ke bharat aane kaa sabase bada kaaran chhuttiïyaan bitaana hi he
 The bottom line of interacting with tourists is that they work hard, so it is necessary to have fun on holidays
 danniel kii maane to ''20 se 30 kii umr ke zyaadaatar israeli saal main ek baar ghoomane jarur nikalate hai
 According to police, they are disciplined and do not break the law
 ” haal hi main sthanantarit upkhand magisterat nishu agnihotri ke shabdon main, ''aaj kii taarikh main bhi pushkar main yahi koi 2,000 israeli sailaani hai par unase kanoon-vyavastha kii kahin koi samasya khadi hone kii koi khabar nahin he
 ”but these tourists have definitely seen the addiction to addiction
 dasek saal pehle tak pushkar main israeli sailaaniyon kii taadaad amuman duusare deshon se aane vaale paryatakon jitani hi hua karti thi
 Then their main attraction used to be Goa
 yahaan par yaîdi saamudayik bhawan khabaad kii sthapana hone se inaki sankhya badaae lagi
 In view of this, Khabad was later shifted to a large hotel near the main bus stand
 vahaan yahudee dharm guru rabbi ko bhi bulaayaa gaya
 non-israelites are not allowed in Khabad
 goa main khabaad 2009 main band hone or himachal pradesh, arunachal pradesh vagairah main sakhti ke baad to pushkar jaise israeli sailaaniyon kaa mukhya adda hi ban gaya
 The pillar here has now become the largest in India
 kai baar to ek samay par israeli sailaaniyon kii taadaad yahaan 4,000 tak pahunch jaati he
 Jewish Guru Aryava explains that the khabad acts like a reform center
 israel main kisi ke liye bhi yuvavastha main sainya prashikshan lenaa jaruri he
 After training, youth consider India a suitable place to spend money on fun
 inhen main se nasha vagairah karne vaale yuvaaon ko sudhaarney ke liye khabaad kholaa gaya he, jisase ki ve apni samskruti ko bhul na saken
 But despite these claims, many Israeli tourists keep doing rave parties, etc
 isi ko dekhte hue sthaneey purohiton main in par ankush lagane kii bhi maang shuru ho gai he
 Well, hotels and others have benefited from the increase in tourist arrivals, but this increasing number has become a headache for the administration and intelligence department
 pakistani aatankwaadi david colman hedli ne 2011 main america main pakade jane ke baad bataaya tha ki 2008 main mumbai par hamale se pehle usne pushkar main rahakar yahaan ke khabaad kii reki kii thi
 He stayed in the hotel just opposite Khabad and prepared a complete map here
 is khulaase se guptchar vibhaag bhi sakate main tha kyonki hedli ke pushkar main rahane ke baavjood uske aise koi dastavej mili hi nahin
 Subsequently, a lawsuit was filed against the hotel owner and Khabad was given high-class special protection
 khufia beuro, military intelligence, sibiai or rajasthan aatank nirodhi daste samet desh kii paanch vibhinn agenciyon ne khabaad kaa muyna karke apaat kaarykram bhi banaae
 The state government deployed armed police for 24 hours there
 agnihotri ne pichley dinon khabaad prabandhakon se ise pushkar se baahar sthanantarit karne ke nirdesh die
 The hotel owner was asked not to extend the lease of Khabad
 agnihotri ke anusaar, ''yah suraksha kaa masalaa he or khabaad kii suraksha ke liye kade kadam uthaane jaruri hai
 During the Pushkar cattle fair, heavy security has to be done here and the security of Khabad on that is an additional responsibility for us
 ” duniya bhar main yahudiyon ke khilaaf aatankwaad kii ghatnaon ko dekhte hue pushkar main suraksha jaruri ho gai he
 Armed police and detectives have regular duties at Khabad
 phir bhi koi ghatana hoti he to iskaa asar dharmik nagari par padegaa, kyonki khabaad pushkar ke bichobich bana he
 Recently, the Central Bus Stand near Khabad was also moved to another place, so that there could be little gap in the movement of devotees and tourists
 israeli paryatakon kii badi aavak ne pushkar kasbe ko nayaa rojgaar diya he par ise antarrashtriya str par ab utana hi samvedansheel bhi bana diya he
 The local police and later the CID were given an investigation after the murder
 18 log shaq ke daayre main bhi aae the lekin kisi kii giraftaar nahin ho pai thi
 The investigation was handed over to the CBI by the Bombay High Court 2 years later
 ab vaardaat ke 4 saal baad jaakar 2 aaropee pakade ja sake hai
 The government, which has been unhappy with several reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) over the alleged scams, which have come to light in the last few months, said that it is actively considering the proposal to make the CAG a multi-member organization
 pradhanmantri karyaalay main rajyamantri narayansami ne kaha ki kaig bahut ‘utaavle’ ho gayi hai or vah chaahate hai ki sabhi sanvaidhanik sansthaaen unke mandandon ke bheetar kaam karen
 He said, "there is an active discussion about making CAG a multi-member organization in this regard
 sarkaar is par sakriyata se vichaar kar rahi he
 Former Controller and Auditor General VK Shunglu had made such a suggestion about which Narayanasamy gave the above response in response to the question asked
 shungalu ne suzav diya tha, ‘teen sadasyeey sanstha apane sanchaalan main or adhik paardarshita barteg
 a member must be a Chartered Accountant or its equivalent, with professional audit qualification
 
 'he said in a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh,' It should not be seen as the removal of the Indian Audit and Accounts Service Officer from a three-member body, having experience in finance, accounting and best international practices in these areas
 Ho
 ’maujuuda kaig vinod raay kii ore se anek maukon par kii gayi tippaniyon ke sandarbh main mantri ne kaha, ‘yah durbhagyapurna he ki is desh main sanvaidhanik sanstha sarkaar ke faislon par hi tippanee kar rahi he
 'narayanasamy said,' Recently such statements are coming from the CAG which are inappropriate
 meri raay he ki yah anuchit or anaavashyak hai
 i think opinions have become more rash nowadays
 main aisa mahasoos karata hum
 'he said,' i am not criticizing that
 main yah bataa rahaa hum ki sarkaar main sabhi ko unhen diye mandandon ke bheetar kaam karnaa chahie
 The Minister said that the work of the CAG is to study whether several agencies of the Government of India are spending properly
 loksabhaa main puducheri sansadeey kshetra kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale mantri ne kaha, ‘meri raay main kaig apane adhikaar kshetra se pare jaakar kaam kar rahe hai
 This is my personal opinion, not official
 koi bhi sanvaidhanik sanstha ho, kaig ho, sivisi ho yaa chunaav ayog ho yaa koi mantri ho, hamen samvidhan kii ruparekha ke daayre main bharat sarkaar ke banaaye niyamon ke tahat kaam karnaa chahie
 He said that my request to the CAG is that he should discharge the responsibilities within the constitutional framework under these criteria otherwise it would be very unjust
 2ji spectrum or koyala block aavanton main aniyamittaaon kaa daawa karne vaali kaig kii reporton ke bare main puche jane par narayansami ne kaha, ‘kya koi aniyamitata hui yaa koi bhrashtachar hua he, is bare main jaanch-padtaal tay tantra karegaa or vah sansad he
 He said, 'the CAG report is a draft report
 ise loksabhaa adhyaksh ke saamne pesh kiya jaataa he
 The Lok Sabha Speaker will send it to the Public Accounts Committee
 piesi kaig kii tippaniyon par adhyayan karegi or apane nishkarsh bataaegi
 Only the CAG said so it should be considered final, it does not happen
 ’mantri ne kaha ki kaig kii report par padtaal piesi karti he
 He said, 'he is a committee of Parliament
 vah report degi or uske baad keval sarkaar karrwai kar sakati he
 The government will not take action only on the CAG report
 ’narayansami ne kaha, ‘kaig dwaara hajaaron report jamaa kii gayi hai
 He has blamed chief ministers of many states, ministers of states, officials of many states and the center

 He expressed support for his party leader Digvijay Singh's demand that the leak of the report allegedly from the CAG office be stopped
 narayansami ne kaha, ‘puraa maamla yah he ki report jamaa hone se pehle saarvajanik ho jaati hai
 Whose protection is it? How does it become public? Who is responsible for this?' Android 10 ko aadhikarik taur par relies kar diya gaya he
 Google launched its mobile operating system Android 10, almost two months after it was announced
 3 sitambar ko lonching ke dauraan company ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki aaj se hi Pixel smartfones ke liye android 10 kaa apadet jari kiya ja rahaa he
 That is, in the coming days, Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL users will get Android 10 update
 baharhaal keval google picksal smartfones ke liye android 10 kaa apadet nahin jari kiya gaya he balki Andy Rubin ke Essential smartfones or oneplus ke letest oneplus 7 or oneplus 7 Pro smartfones main bhi android 10 kaa apadet milanaa shuru ho gaya he
 oneplus has rolled out the open beta build of Android 10 for its new oneplus series (oneplus 7 and oneplus 7 Pro)
 isaki jaankaree khud vanplus kii ore se twitor par di gai he
 These are new features: - New UI design - Enhanced location permission for privacy - New customization features - From left navigation bar can now be switched left or right for recent apps - New game space feature - Updated ambient display - Now message Will be able to block spam from keywords - Some bug fixes will also be found in oneplus 7 and oneplus 7 Pro Install in this way Android 10 Open Beta Updates Switch to the more than 30 percent of batteries in their phones and devices in storage for at least 3GB
 saath hi yugers apadet se pehle saare data byaap karnaa bhi naa bhoolen

 yahaan se local apgrade main jaaen, yahaan se instolation package main or apgrade karen
 - Click restart after the system upgrade is 100 percent
 dhyaan rahe ye stable bild nahin he aise main is software main kuth bags ho sakate hai
 oneplus has informed that stable builds of oneplus 7 and oneplus 7 Pro will be released soon
 aisa lagata he ki buudhvaar ko film relies karnaa akshay kumaar or ranbir kapur ke liye kuch khaas kaam nahin kar sakaa he
 Perhaps he was looking for a longer week in hopes of achieving success like Salman Khan
 lekin baaji ulti hi pad gai
 Of course, the reason for this has been a weak story
 agar salmaan khan kaa record dekhen to unki film ek tha tiger 2012 main 15 agast yani buudhvaar ke din relies hui thi
 The film made 32 on this day
 92 karod ru
 Had earned bos se jude sutron kii maane to film ne pehle din 15 karod ru
 Earned
 is din bhi id thi
 Since then, there has been a continuous decline in the collection of the film
 film ne pehle paanch dinon main 45
 5 crores Rs
 kii kamai kar lee he
 The film's earnings are after receiving a decent review of the film
 film kii laagat lagbhag 70 karod ru
 It is said
 shaayad yah mana ja saktaa he ki buudhvaar ko film relies karnaa sitaron ke liye mafik nahin baith rahaa he
 Ranbir Kapoor's shamelessness was similar to this
 50 karod ru
 The film made with a budget of Rs
 58 crore so far
 kaa kaarobaar hi kar saki he
 Similarly Krrish-3 was to be released on November 4 (monday)
 lekin distributor or agjibitors ke ishaare par film ko 1 november (shuukravaar) ko relies karne kaa faisla liya gaya
 Looking at the fate of these two films, this decision of people associated with Krish-3 can be called good
 lekin asli kahani to film relies ke baad hi pataa chalegi
 In Thane, Mumbai, a security guard named Yogesh Jadav was caught red-handed while making a video in the chasing room of his own colleague
 kolsate road sthit daftar main mahila duty khatm hone ke baad 8 baje kapade badalane changing room gai usee samay company kaa hi ek security guardmahila kaa videobana rahaa tha
 The entire incident was captured in the CCTV camera installed in the company
 company ke adhikariyon ne is ghatana kii jaanch ke baadpulice main shikaayat darjakarvaai
 The Kapurbawadi police arrested the security guard for violating the 37-year-old woman's privacy

 America is the first team to achieve a hat-trick of World Cup titles in women's football
 kuccha main bhartiya tatarakshakon dwaara 11 pakistani machuaaron kii giraftaar ke ek din baad, padosi mulk ne ravivaar ko gujarat tat ke najadik bhartiya 12 machuaaron ko giraftaar kar liya he
 Not only this, two boats of these fishermen have also been confiscated and all have been taken to Karachi
 gauratlab he ki shanivaar ko bhartiya tat rakshakon ne kuccha ke jakhau tat se 11 pakistanimchuaaron ko giraftaarakia tha
 National Fishworks Forum (NFF) Secretary Manish Lodhari said that these fishermen have been arrested by the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency (PMSA) near the international sea border line
 jaankaree ke mutabik, ye machuaare paanch-chah din pehle gujarat ke dwarka jila sthit tateey shahar okha se ravaanaa hue the
 Lodhari said, 'we came to know about this incident from the fishermen who returned here
 hamen bataaya gaya ki machhlee pakadaney kii do naukaaon par savaar 12 machuaaron ko piemesa ne pakad liya he or unhen karachi le jaaya gaya he

 In addition, about 860 fishing boats are in Pakistan's possession
 koyala ghotaalaa maamla manmohan sarkaar ke liye gale kii haddi ban gaya he
 The Manmohan government seems to be trapped badly in this
 is maamle me jabardast mode tab aayaa jab pradhanmantri karyaalay ne is baat ko kabool kar liya ki kumaar mangalam birla kii company hindalco ko kol block ke aavanton kii manjuuri pradhanmantri ne hi saal 2005 main di thi
 The funny thing is that while on one hand the CBI is allocating the coal block allocated to Hindalco, on the other hand, the Prime Minister says that there is nothing wrong in the allocation of coal block to Hindalco
 piemo ne kumaar mangalam birla ke netritv vaale hindalco sahit ek sanyukt upkram ko kiye gaye koyala blaak aavanton main kisi tarah ke aparaadh se inkaar kiya
 The Prime Minister's Office made it clear that Singh was the 'competent authority' who approved the proposal submitted by the Ministry of Coal in the year 2005
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ne sweekaar kiya ki aavanton ko lekar ek aktubar 2005 vaala antim nirnay padtaal samiti kii sifarish se ‘alag’ tha
 The Prime Minister's Office released the details of the sequence of events, which meant that the norms were laid down by the Prime Minister, due to Birla and Odisha's Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik being softened
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ne is mudde par hangaame ke bich jari ek bayaan main kaha, ‘pradhanmantri is baat ko lekar santusht hai ki is sambandh main kiya gaya antim nirnay puri tarah se uchit tha or yah unke samaksh rakhe gaye maamle se sambandhit gun dosha ripet gun dosha ke aadhaar par kiya gaya
 The Prime Minister's Office has justified the allocation of coal blocks to Hindalco and justified it
 piemo ne is maamle main kisi bhi gadabadi ko khaarij karte hue ek bayaan main kaha ki pradhanmantri ke saamne pesh kiye gaye maamle ke gun-dosha or odisha sarkaar kii talabira-2 koyala khand hindalco ko dene kii sifarish ke aadhaar par koyala mantralay ne yah faisla kiya tha
 The recommendation stated that this would create employment
 bayaan main kaha gaya he ki aavanton, jaanch ke nishkarsh par nirbhar hoga or kendriya anveshan beuro-sibiai ke jaanch jari rakhane or nai soochna praapt karne par koi roak nahin he
 Meanwhile, the Odisha government has justified Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik's move in which he wrote a letter to the Prime Minister asking Hindalco to allot coal blocks
 gauratlab he ki sibiai ne chaar din pehle aditya birla samooh ke adhyaksh kumaar mangalam or purv koyala sachiv pi si paarekh ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya he
 Parekh has said that if he was an accused in the conspiracy, the prime minister should also be made an accused as he had approved the amended decision in this regard
 is par bhaajapa ne pradhanmantri ke tyaagptr kii maang kar di
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday distributed a check for increased compensation among the 1984 Sikh riot victims
 pichley saal sarkaar ne sikh danga peediton ke muaavje ko badhaane kaa faisla kiya tha
 Delhi government will distribute compensation of 130 crores
 is raahat raashi se kareeb 2600 pariwaron ko phayda hoga
 Confrontation in central-delhi Government Last year, the Central Government had announced to give a sum of five lakh rupees to the Sikh riot victims
 lekin kuch pariwaron ko hi yah raashi mil pai
 The Delhi government wrote a letter to the central government in this regard and demanded to distribute the relief amount at the earliest
 maamla vidhansabha main bhi uthaa tha, lekin centre ke taraf se raahat raashi na milane ke baad dilli sarkaar ne apane rajasav se yah raashi vitarit karne kaa faisla kiya
 On this occasion, Delhi Chief Minister Arvid Kejriwal said- 'this massacre was so bad that the world was bowed down
 dilli or centre main har tarah kii sarkaar bani or sikhon ko insaaf dilaane kii baat kahi lekin kyon insaaf nahin dilaayaa gaya
 If people of 1984 were punished, Gujarat and Dadri would not have happened
 'kejariwal ne kaha- jo congress ne 31 saal main nahin kiya wo 49 din main hamane kiya
 Justice will get justice
 aaj desh ko sirf aam aadmi bachaa saktaa he, chaaron taraf nafrat failaa rakhi he or raashtrapati ne bhi dukh jataayaa he isape
 a check of 5 lakh rupees is a small tribute
 aane vaale samay main koi himmat nahin karegaa nafrat failaane kii
 If there is punishment in any one case
 sabak milani chahieis maukey par aap netaa eses phulka ne kaha ki danga peediton kaa haq muaavje or insaaf donon par he
 There is also a lesson that such incidents should not happen from now on
 phulka ne kaha ki aage aise jurm na ho iske liye sabak dena zaruri he
 
 
 If i had given a lesson, i would not have to look in Gujarat in 1993 and 2002 and Dadri and other places
 congress, NDA par hamalaphulka ne kaha- 49 dinon kii sarkaar main congress ne SIT ko roak diya
 
 
 But on 12 February the NDA turned SIT and mocked the victims
 SIT bananaa dilli sarkaar kaa kaam tha
 But the center came in the middle, yet we approved the SIT of the center but after 9 months nothing has happened
 phulka ne kaha ki ham kejariwal ji se maang karenge kii centre kii SIT ko radd karwaane main aage aayen or ham court kaa rukh bhi karenge
 In Mumbai, there has been an increase in the number of women having abortions in the last few years
 hairaani kii baat he ki sabase zyada ve mahilaayein garbhpaat kara rahi hai jinhone garbhanirodhak goliyon kaa istemaal kiya
 According to the latest data, more than thirty thousand women have undergone abortions in Mumbai last year
 tivi par aapane garbhanirodhak goliyon kaa vigyaapan jarur dekha hoga
 Women use these pills as a contraceptive measure
 magar hairaani kii baat he ki in garbhanirodhak goliyon kaa seven karne ke baavjood mahilaayein garbhvatee ho rahi hai or unhen majaburi main garbhpaat karwaanaa pad rahaa he
 If we talk about Mumbai metropolis, then there has been an increase of about 50 percent in abortion cases in 2013-14
 isamen sabase adhik andheri, juhu, malwani or tilakanagar jaise ilaakon main sabase adhik garbhpaat hone kii baat saamne ai he
 There is another shocking thing in the report, which states that in addition to the neutralization of the pills, 5 percent gender-testing in Mumbai has also been reported
 jabaki lagbhag 8 fisadi ne apni jaan ko jokhim main daalkar garbhpaat karavaaya he
 Doctor Ritu Jain says that the increase in abortion cases in this way is worrying and it can prove to be very fatal for the lives of women
 darasal garbhpaat ko lekar jo report saamne ai he usne pichley teen saalon ke record tod die hai
 While there were a total of 19701 abortion cases in 2011-12, a total of 27,256 women have had abortions in 2012-13 and 30,117 in 2013-14
 jabaki saal 2014 ke abhi keval kuch maheene hi beete he or ye aankada teji se upar kii taraf bad rahaa he

 According to the news from our sources, the employees who were earlier working in these old pcs, the company has started the work of updating those computers by removing them from work
 taaki sambhavit khataron ko taala ja sake
 Significantly, as soon as incidents of cyber attack occurred worldwide, it became known that the old Windows XP system was the most targeted
 kyonki mana jaataa he ki in computaron ko hack karnaa havers ke liye behad aasaan hota he
 Let me tell you that a part of the computers of the Andhra Pradesh Police Department was targeted by hackers on Saturday under the Global Cyber attack
 chitoor, krishna, guntur, vishakhapatnam or shrikulam jile ke 18 police units ke computer sibar hamale se prabhavit hue the, haalanki adhikariyon kaa kahana tha ki rosemara ke kaamon main koi pareshaani nahin ai

 Antony has bluntly told Pakistan that now we want only and only results
 pakistan ke campon main training lekar napak mishan par nikalne vaale ye aatankwaadi kai baar bharat main maut kaa tandav dikhaa chuke hai
 But the Defense Minister has warned the world that India has been targeted till now, there are other countries on its target
 vaise raksha mantri ne is baat kii khushi jaahir kii he ki mumbai hamale ke baad kai mulkon ne bharat ke saath khadey hokar aatankwaad ke khilaaf ekajutata dikhaai
 The Taliban is showing its most frightening face to the people of the Swat Valley of North West Frontier Province
 swat ghati main taliban maasoom bacchon ko kasaai banane kii talim to kaaphi dinon se de rahaa tha, ab vah dikhaa rahaa he maasoom chehre vaale khoonkhaar aatankwaadiyon kaa video
 The video is also shocking
 taliban kii ore se swat ghati hi nahin, balki puure north west frontier provins main aise-aise video tepe dikhaae ja rahe hai, jisamen 12-15 saal ke bacchon kaa giroh achaanak kisi duusare bachche par hamalaa bolta he or phir badi berahami se ret dete hai us maasoom bachche kii gardan
 Huge videos of innocent children carrying weapons in their hands are shown to the public
 dil bhale kaanpata rahe, lekin talibani dehshat kii screen se nazaren hataane yaa phir palken khapkaane kaa matlab he maut
 For those who refuse to watch the video of the Taliban, the Taliban has fixed the death sentence
 taliban kaa khufanaak cheharaa baccha-baccha dekh le, iskaa intazaam taliban ke himytiyon ne kar diya he
 They are downloading the video of terror on their mobile phones and sending it from door to door
 pakistan ke north west frontier provins main taliban kii dehshat nai nahin he
 The people of Swat Valley have also started getting used to Taliban decrees, but the Taliban's intent is very dangerous behind the video of the terror that the Taliban is now showing
 ye sochakar logon kii ruh kaanp rahi he ki taliban ab puure pakistan kii nasl bigaadane main juta he
 He does not want to make children honest, but honest
 afghanistan se lautne ke baad taliban ne pakistan main jis swat ghati ko apana thikaana banaaya tha, wo ghati ab taliban kii factory main tabdeel ho chuki he
 The Taliban is making human bombs in this factory
 pakistan ke halaat se vaakif logon ne bhi ab maan liya he ki jis swat ghati ko pakistan kii jananath kaha jaataa tha, us khubasurat vaadi ko taliban ne ab khaufnak jahannum bana daalaa he
 Taliban madrasas training a for Allah as well as b for bomb have found an army of young men in Swat and surrounding areas who are ready to die at a behest of the Taliban
 naam jehad kaa he, lekin taliban ke ye aatmghaatee aatankwaadi bikne ke liye bhi taiyaar hai
 He is also taking bets on the murder of a VIP and a contract to hire a terrorist organization
 taliban kii factory main taiyaar maanav bam pakistan ke liye musiibat hai, to hindustan ke liye bahut bada khatara he
 Experts believe that lashkar-e-taiba, jaish-e-muhammad and Al Qaeda have a strong connection with the Pakistani Taliban
 isliye zarurat padane par taliban ke aatmghaatee aatankwaadi hindustan par hamale main istemaal kiye ja sakate hai
 Anyway, the Taliban has openly threatened that its human bombs are ready to attack India
 taliban ke napak aatanki mansoobon ko anjaam dete hai uske jehadi ladaake jo taliban kii sabase badi takat hai
 These jihadi fighters can do anything at the command of their boss
 jaan le bhi sakate hai to jaan de bhi sakate hai
 Jihadis or terrorists are trained in four parts
 ye chaaron charan behad khatarnaak hoten hai
 The duration of the first part is of three months
 is dauraan 16 se 21 saal kii umr ke rangaruton ko shaareerik or maansik taur par taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 Meanwhile, fighters are not allowed to marry
 is training ke liye ye bhi jaruri he ki chune gayi ladaakon ko kisi bhi tarah kii beemaari naa ho, unhen padhanaa likhnaa aata ho or wo jihad ke liye puri tarah taiyaar hon
 This training is six months long
 is dauraan jehad ke liye samarpit ladaakon ko hathiyaar chalaanaa sikhaaya jaataa he
 Before this training, all fighters have to prepare a will with their own hands and give it to their commander
 tisare hisse kii training 3 maheene tak chalati he or isamen aatankiyon ko khaastaur par bam banane kii training di jaati he
 In this part of the training, terrorists are also given training in heavy weaponry
 chauthaa hisse kaa prashikshan ek hafte se lekar 10 din tak chalata he
 During this time, the fighters are given special training to operate small hand weapons like pistols and knives
 vaise to in chaar dauron se guzarane ke baad jehad kii training puri ho jaati he
 During this training, there is also a dirty game of creating hatred in the name of religion in the hearts and minds of the terrorists, which affects the jihadis the most
 iske baad jehadi kisi ko bhi bhi maarane ke liye taiyaar ho jate hai
 But the real training still remains
 aatankiyon ko taiyaar kiya jaataa he kisi bhi vakt jaan dene ke liye or wo ban jate hai maanav bam
 In this, they themselves die, as well as they keep many lives silent with them forever
 is training ke liye baqayda khaas class lagaai jaati he, jisamen maanav bam kaise ore kin haalat main bananaa he is par khaas jor diya jaataa he
 After all these training, now all the fighters become Jihadis and start the business of spreading terror all over the world
 itnaa hi pakistan kii army chif general kayaani ke hawaale se bhi khabar he ki ve bharat se jang karne ke liye puri tarah taiyaar hai
 It is said about General Kayani that while Kayani was the chief of Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI, Kayani added the Taliban inside Pakistan
 yahi vajah thi ki pakistani army ne pashtun belt par apana aapa kho diya
 There came a period under the rule of General Musharraf when the relations between the Pakistan Army and the Taliban soured in response to America
 lekin jaankaron kii raay main mumbai hamalon ke baad halaat badal rahe hai
 The distance between the Taliban and the Pak Army is decreasing day by day
 taliban ke bhadkaa bayaan bhi yahi ishaara kar rahe hai
 After the Mumbai attack, India has generally told Pakistan and the world in every tone, terrorism is not tolerable to India and the world will also have to unite against terror, but it is eagerly waiting to see how long this effect will show

 Officers should be satisfied before the FIR: On the statement of the court, the Supreme Court raised the question that if the court does not enforce the right to live in this country, then who will? Why can't the court exercise its right to enforce its right to live? The Supreme Court said that the court order is being misinterpreted
 hamane kaha he ki FIR se pehle afasar santusht hon ki kisi ko jhootha to nahin fansaaya ja rahaa he
 Court cannot make such new law: On the question of Attorney General Court, Attorney General KK Venugopal on behalf of Central Government said that the court cannot make new law like this

 There are some provisions in this Act where there will be only a sentence of 6 months

 The Supreme Court said that the Central Government is saying that only 15 per cent of the cases have been registered under this Act
 iskaa matlab ye nahin kii baaki 85 fisadi sahi hon
 In 75% of the cases, 85% of the accused, the Barisuprim Court, told the Central Government that if you have any data, give it
 tab emicas (nyaay mitra) amrendra saran ne kaha ki baaki 85 fisadi maamalon main se 75 fisadi main aaropee adaalat se bari ho gaye

 It is now clear from the results and trends of the Maharashtra and Haryana Assembly elections that the Modi wave that had arisen in the country before the Lok Sabha elections is still intact
 donon hi rajyon main bijepi ne congress ko satta se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya he
 It is a different matter that the BJP will have to join another party to form the government in Maharashtra
 kul milakar yah chunaav har siyaasi party ke liye kuch na kuch sabak jarur chhod gaya he
 Here it is tried to investigate what message came out for the parties from these results
 
 
 maharashtra ke chunavi nattejey isliye kaaphi ahm ho jate hai, kyonki vahaan chunaav se thik pehle do puraane gathbandhan achaanak tut gaye
 After this, all the big parties tried their own power
 1
 BJP: In Maharashtra, BJP is looking to strengthen its roots in the state by scoring a century on its own
 bijepi kii kamyaabi ne kaaryakartaaon main bhi josh paidaa kar diya he
 The BJP took advantage of the risk it took by breaking alliance with Shiv Sena
 bijepi ke liye sabak yahi he ki use apane nae party adhyaksh amit shah par haal main bharosa barkaraar rakhana hoga or aane vaale chunaavon main bhi unki ranneeti ko hi tarjeeh deni hogi
 Also, if you want to achieve more, you have to be ready to take similar risks
 2
 Shiv Sena: The lesson for Shiv Sena is that it is much more beneficial to leave the stubbornness in politics and read the waves and then follow it accordingly
 yah alag baat he ki bijepi se alag hone ke baad bhi shivasena kaa aadhaar kamjor nahin hua
 Despite this, over-ambition can prove detrimental to the party
 3
 Congress: Congress has been accused of misrule and scams in the state, while the party has focused its attention solely on changing leadership
 congress ke liye sabak loksabhaa chunaav jaisaa hi he
 The public wants development and good governance
 keval aaropon se pallaa jhaad lene bhar se public kaa bharosa jeetna naammumkin he
 4
 ncp:ensipi ke liye sabak yahi he ki use janata ke bich apni chhavi or behatar banani hogi
 Separating from a party like the Congress just before the election is not a more profitable deal

 In a changing era, a publication cannot be misled for a long time
 haryana main bijepi apane dam par sarkaar banane ja rahi he
 The results of this state also have some lessons for political parties
 1
 BJP: Even though there was no strong face of CM in BJP in the state, the party has gained power with the help of Modi wave
 massej saaf he ki janata vikaas ke naam par bijepi par bharosa jataa rahi he
 He will have to live up to the expectations of the people in the coming times
 2
 Congress: The lesson for the Congress that is going to be ousted from power is that it will have to get more good marks from the people in the paper of honesty even in the coming elections
 iske bina apane vaale daur main uske liye or bhi zyada mushkilen khadi ho sakati hai

 HJC (BL): The coming round for the party can prove to be more difficult

 In such a situation, big political parties will have to take a lesson and keep a close watch on their moves and faces, otherwise this is what is published

 The leader who had the power to forgive the debt of the farmers of India even in the slavery of the British, used to stop the auction of their fields and got the bill of land used, which is still called the Messiah of the farmers, his name is Chaudhary Charan Singh
 
 choudhary charan singh bhartiya arthshaastra ke vidwaan the
 Raising voice for farmers throughout life is perhaps the real reason that Chaudhary Charan Singh has been labeled as the messiah of farmers
 haalanki, aaj charan singh ke vaaris unki viraasat ko sahejane main vifal ho gaye hai jab charan singh kii 32veen punyatithi (29 may) he to rashtriya lokdal us muhane par pahunch gai he jahaan har taraf sookhaa hi sookhaa najar aa rahaa he
 When Charan Singh's politics began, it was everywhere
 yahaan tak ki angrejon ke shashan main bhi charan singh kii tuuti bolti thi
 He continued to represent the Chaprauli assembly seat of Baghpat till 1977
 is bich unhone gaanv, garib or kisaanon ke liye jamkar kaam kiye
 When Charan Singh became MLA in the interim government of 1937, he passed the debt waiver bill in 1939 while in government
 charan singh kaa ye wo kadam tha, jo aaj bhi raajnneetik dalon kaa mukhya agenda mana jaataa he
 At the same time, Charan Singh stopped the auction of farmers' fields

 com / pwcfdbx9tt — Rashtriya Lok Dal (@rldparty) May 29, 2019 Charan Singh did all this work while in Congress Party
 lekin kareeb 40 saal tak desh kii sabase puraani party kaa hissaa rahane ke baad 1967 main unhone istipha de diya
 This was the time when Jawaharlal Nehru was dead and there was a ruckus about leadership in the Congress and the Indira Gandhi era had begun
 lihaaja, charan singh ne apana rasta alag kar liya or congress se istipha dene ke baad hi bhartiya kranti dal kaa gathan kar liya
 The political situation became such that Charan Singh became the Chief Minister of UP and took this responsibility for about a year
 ye pehla mauka tha jab upi main gaiyr-congress sarkaar kaa gathan hua
 This government included the Jana Sangh, Socialist, Praja Socialist, Swatantra Party and Communist, which was amazing in itself

 However, the Janata Party soon became divided

 Charan Singh became Prime Minister in July 1979
 haalanki, kuch din baad hi indira gandhi ne samarthan waapas le liya or charan singh kii sarkaar bhi gir gai
 It is also a history that Charan Singh was the only Prime Minister who never faced Parliament
 choudhary charan singh ke pautra jayant choudharichoudhary charan singh ke bare main ek or badi baat ye kahi jaati he ki wo mahatma gandhi ko maanane vaale lekin nehru ke pratispardhi the
 He never underestimated himself

 He was then married to Gayatri Devi
 charan singh kii 6 santanon main ek choudhary ajit singh hai, jo philhal rashtriya lokdal ke adhyaksh hai
 Even today there are farmers on the National Lok Dal's agenda, but it has failed to win the trust of the public
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav or 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main areldi kii karaari haar ne uske astitv par sankat khadaa kar diya he
 The party won only one MLA, who later joined the BJP
 philhal, areldi kaa na koi vidhayak he or na hi koi saansad
 Even in the current election, both Chaudhary Ajit Singh and his son Jayant Singh have lost the election
 29 may 1987 ko aakhri saans lene vaale choudhary charan singh ne kisaanon kii raajnneeti kar jo viraasat ajit singh ko saunpi thi, uski fasal ab barbaad ho gai he

 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hinduist organization, has prepared the campaign plan to conquer the Mission-2017 in Uttar Pradesh
 yahi nahin, is babat ek survey report sanghathan ne apane purv prachaarak or pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bhi saunp di he
 The Sangh in its report has made several important suggestions for the return of power in UP
 report main kaha gaya he ki yadi bijepi ko upi main satta main vaapasi kerani he to abhiyaan kii kaman kisi ek netaa ke haathon main na saunpkar, ek majboot team ko upi main utaarna hoga
 It has been suggested that if a powerful leader from the Center also needs to be deployed in UP
 gupachup tareeke se bani he reportsurvey main lage logon ke mutabik, bijepi kisi bhi keemat par2017 main upi kii satta hasil karnaa chaahati he
 To achieve this goal, its mother organization Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has secretly conducted the study with the help of its senior campaigners and survey agencies of youth of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi
 usee report ke aadhaar par party yahaan agle vidhansabha chunaav kii ranneeti taiyaar karegi
 The RSS report also suggested the names of leaders for the bjp's return to UP in which the upper caste-backward-dalit leaders of different castes have been suggested to form a region-wise trio
 saath hi kaha gaya he ki uske peeche pradesh netritv ke jujharu netaaon kii jugalbandi yaa tikdi ko team ke rup main khadaa karnaa hoga
 It has been said in the report that it would be better to develop a team of leaders of Jamaat instead of leaders of castes
 iske liye party ko upi main badi surgery kaa suzav diya gaya he
 Suggesting for the organization general secretary, the state president, organization general secretary, leaders of both houses of the legislature have been asked to re-constitute the social equation

 Such leaders are forbidden to form part of the organization and electoral strategy, whose attitude towards the establishment of power in UP and who have been constantly accused of economic attacks
 kisi bahari ko pratyaashee na banaaensang kii report main kaha gaya he ki saansadon ke suzav par kisi bhibahari vyakti ko party pratyaashee na banaaen
 If in any case, it seems appropriate to do so, then the proposal of the local organization should be brought

 On the suggestions of senior leaders, the cognizant Central Ministers have been asked to give realization to the schemes related to their departments in their respective areas which are pro-poor with regional development
 saath hi nepathy main bhej die gaye varisht netaaon ke saath pradesh mukhyalay par sasamman masik baithak kar unki tippanee kaa gambhirtha se sangyaan liya jaae

 Krishna Gopal, National President Amit Shah, National General Secretary Organization Ramlal, State in-charge Om Mathur and the team engaged in the survey have already set out to organize a one-day meditation program somewhere in Delhi in December

 If for some reason the party does not emerge strong in UP, then Prime Minister Modi secretly used his core issue to come to power at the Center in 2014, be clear on the same agenda in 2019, otherwise it will be difficult to get across

 com / kiakkd9ebc Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal rejected the claim of former telecom secretary Siddharth Behura jailed in 2G case in which he said in court that the then Finance Minister p Chidambaram and Finance in a meeting in December 2007 on the entry fee for 2G license Secretary D
 Subbarao was present
 sibbal ne kaha, ‘‘hamane ricard dekha he
 The record states that there was no such meeting
 na to chidambaram (ab grahamantri) ko or na hi subbarao (ab rigerv bank ke governor) ko is prakaar kii koi baithak kii yaad he
 "it is amazing that Behura became the telecom secretary on January 1, 2008 and he is referring to the meeting on December 4, 2007," he said
 us samay unhen iske bare main nijee taur par koi jaankaree nahin thi or unhone apane bayaan ke samarthan main koi dastavej bhi nahin pesh kiya he
 On Wednesday, Behura said before Special CBI Judge OP Saini that Subbarao decided to retain the entry fee of Rs 1,659 crore for 2G license and if the then finance secretary is not an accused in the case, he should not be heard against
 
 behura ke vakil aman lekhi ne kaha tha, ‘‘chaar disambar 2007 ko hui baithak main subbarao ne faisle ko antim rup diya tha
 It approved the policy and stated that there is no need to revise the entry fee (rs 1,659 crore earmarked during the NDA rule in 2001)
 ’’ behura pichley chah maheene se jail main hai
 Lekhi had said, "the then Finance Minister p Chidambaram was also present in the meeting held on December 4, 2007
 vitt mantralay ke hissaa rahe subbarao ne agar koi galati nahin kii to maine kaise galat kiya
 "sibal said," It is dangerous to make the argument given by one of the accused as evidence and accept the complete truth
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘at: adaalat main ek aaropee kii daleel ko swayan ke bachaav main diye gayi bayaan ke rup main liya janaa chahie
 Since he is an accused, he would like to defend himself by any means including unrealistic facts

 The police can also get Honeypreet to get her narco test done to extract the truth
 philhal police kii ek team haniprit ko lekar panchakula sector 23 kii chandi mandi thane se sector 20 thane pahunchi
 From there, Honeypreet was taken to Bathinda, where she was hidden for two days
 sutron ke mutabik, haryana police haniprit kaa narco test karvaa sakati he
 For this, the police is preparing to apply for a narco test in Panchkula court
 darasal, poochtacha ke dauraan lagaataar police ke sawaalon se batch rahi he
 She is also repeatedly changing her statements
 police ko gumraah karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 Therefore, to get the truth out of Honeypreet, the police want to get her narco test done, which is also demanded by a former serviceman
 isi bich panchakula police ne punjab ke bhavanigarh police se sahyog kii maang kii he
 He says that media vehicles are following him
 isliye unako bhavanigarh thane main kuch der ke tehraav ke liye jagah chahie
 On this, the Punjab Police said that they would be given all kinds of support
 jarurat padane par police protection bhi di jaaegi
 Police reached Honeypreet and Bhawanigad police station with Honeypreet and Sukhdeep and the gates there were closed
 iske baad haryana or punjab police haniprit or sukhdeep ko lekar bathinda kii nai basti kii gali number 5 ke us makaan main pahunchi, jahaan par haniprit ko rakhaa gaya tha
 The lock of this house was closed
 police taala todakar andar gai
 Earlier, the police commissioner says that Honeypreet is being questioned
 jarurat ke hisaab se ham use har jagah le jaaenge
 We got a 6-day remand for Honeypreet
 abhi tak ke poochtacha main haniprit bahut kuch nahin bataaya he
 On October 3, after the arrest of Honeypreet, IG Mamta Singh, Panchkula Police Commissioner AS Chawla, DCP Manbir Singh and other police officers started raising questions
 is poochtacha kaa nateeja sabhi ke liye paheli thi
 Everyone wanted to know what secrets Honeypreet posed to the police
 baba ke saath rishton par kya bolaa he
 Let us tell you that in many cases including sedition and inciting violence, accused Honeypreet has been sent to 6 days police custody by the Panchkula court
 court main sunwaayee ke dauraan haniprit haath jodakar roti rahi or khud ko bekasoor bataati rahi
 The Haryana Police had sought 14 days of custody, but the court has sent him for 6 days in custody at present
 police haniprit se poochtacha kar rahi he
 In an exclusive interview to Ajatak, Honeypreet said that after the way she is being shown, she is scared of herself
 use deshadrohi kaha gaya, jo galat he
 Her relationship with father is pak
 usne kaha, 'mujhe samaj main nahin aata he ki baap-beti ke pavitra rishte ko uchhaala gaya
 The reason for my fear was also how i was presented
 depressant main chali gai thi hanipritahanipritne kaha tha ki ram rahim ke jail jane ke baad vah depressant main chali gai thi
 He could not understand what to do
 use logon ne jaisaa bataaya usne vahi kiya
 He has full faith in the court
 vah nyaay ke liye haryana-punjab hoicourt jaaegi
 But before he went to the High Court to surrender, the police caught him
 world kapashuru hone main gine-chune chaar din bache hai or pichley kareeb 3 maheene se australia main deraa daali hui team india ko aakhirkaar jeet kaa swaad chakhne ko mil gaya he
 Team Indian defeated Afghanistan by 153 runs in a practice match
 bharat kii is jeet main rohit sharma, suresh raina or ajinkya rahane jaise kuch sitare timatimaate hue dikhe
 But as a unit, Team India did not impress in this match either
 toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karne kekptain em
 s Dhoni's decision was once again overshadowed by opener Shikhar Dhawan
 ve sirf 4 ran banaakar hi pavilion laut gaye or bharat ko sirf 7 ran ke score par hi pehla jhatka laga
 After this, Virat Kohli's bat, the 'successor' of Sachin Tendulkar, the perfect cancer 'master blaster' once again betrayed him, the team and the fans
 kohli apni pari ko 5 ran se aage nahin badha paae
 In this way, there were only 16 runs on the board and two leading batsmen of India appeared to be resting in the pavilion
 gaur karne laayak baat ye bhi he ki unke saamne australia, dakshin africa yaa england ke gendbaaj goli kii raftaar se ball nahin phenk rahe the
 Rather, the newly born Afghanistan bowlers in the cricket world uprooted the feet of these two players of Team India
 khayr in donon ke out hone ke baad rohit sharma or suresh raina ne acchhee ballebaaji practice kii
 There was a 158-run partnership between the two batsmen
 raina 75 ran banaakar pavilion waapas laute or unke baad maidan par aae ajinkya rahane ne rohit sharma ke saath milakar team kaa score 3 wicket ke nusaan par 269 ran tak pahunchaaya
 On this score, Rohit Sharma was out, he scored 150 runs
 ab rahane kaa saath dene ke liye khud captain mahendra singh dhoni maidan par aae, lekin 20 gendon main 10 ran banaakar pavilion laut gaye
 India's 5th wicket fell as Dhoni
 iske baad bharat ne koi wicket nahin khoyaa
 In this way, India scored 364 runs in a 50-over game
 ajinkya rahane 88 ran or sar ravindra jadeja 11 ran banaakar note out rahe
 The score also includes 21 extra runs scored by the Afghanistan batsmen
 ballebaaji main to do-chaar timatimaate sitaron ne team india ko saadhe teen sau ke paar pahunchaa diya, lekin gendbaaji main team india kii haalat dayaneey he
 While India had lost the first two wickets on a score of just 16 runs, the Indian bowlers were able to get the first wicket of Afghanistan on a total of 30 runs
 iske baad afghanistan ke ballebaajon ne duusare wicket ke liye 63 ran jod die
 Not only this, a 60-run partnership was also done for the fourth wicket
 haalanki iske baad lagaataar antaraal par afghanistan ke ballebaaj aae or pavilion laut gaye
 The most worrying thing for India is that its bowlers were not able to allout even a novice team like Afghanistan
 afghanistan ne 50 over main 8 wicket ganvaakar 211 ran banaae
 Not only this, Indian bowlers also looted 20 runs as an extra in this small score of Afghanistan
 gendbaajon kii ye meharbaani nahin hoti to afghanistan kii team 200 kaa aankada bhi nahin chhu paati
 Navroj Mangal scored the highest for Afghanistan and Usman Ghani scored 44 runs
 bharat ke 'star gendbaaj' mohammad sami 9 over main 39 ran dekar ek bhi wicket hasil nahin kar paae, jabaki duusare 'star gendbaaj' umesh yadav ne 9 over main 35 ran lutaakar ek wicket hasil kiya
 R
 called the 'backbone' of spin bowling
 aswin ne 10 over main 37 ran lutaae or 1 wicket hasil kiya, jabaki mohit sharma or ravindra jadeja ne 2-2 wicket jatke
 One wicket also came in Suresh Raina's bag
 antat: team india ne yah match 153 ran se jeeta
 Congratulations to Team India for a near victory after being cut in Australia for three months
 gujarat ke bade netaaon main shumaar shankar singh waghela ne sharad pavaar kii party ensipi kaa daaman tham liya he
 This time too, he can contest from Sabarkantha seat
 haalanki, 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bataur congress pratyaashee unhen haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 After going to the Congress for nearly two decades, Vaghela's entry into the NCP is seen as an attempt to save his drowning political journey
 shankar singh waghela ne apane raajnneetik safar kii shuruyaat immergency ke daur se kii
 Born in a Rajput family in Vasan, Gandhi Nagar, Vaghela was initially an active member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 immergency ke daur main vah jail bhi gaye
 After the Emergency, he became the first MP from Kapadvanj on the Janapa Party ticket, but lost the seat in the 1980 election

 1989 main waghela gandhinagar loksabhaa seat or 1991 main godhra loksabhaa seat se jite
 In 1995, when BJP won 121 out of 182 seats in Gujarat, legislators Vaghela was chosen as its leader, but the top leadership gave Keshubhai Patel the CM chair
 sitambar 1995 main waghela ne 47 vidhayakon ke samarthan ke saath bijepi netritv ke khilaaf vidroh kar diya
 As a compromise, Suresh Mehta, a Vaghela loyalist, was made the CM, lost the 1996 Lok Sabha election from the Vaghela Godhra seat and soon left the Bharatiya Janata Party with his supporters, leading to the fall of Suresh Mehta's government
 iske baad waghela ne rashtriya janata party naam se apni party banaai or oktober 1996 main congress party ke samarthan se mukhyamantri bane
 He won the by-election to the Gujarat assembly from Radhanpur seat in early 1997, but in October 1997 he was forced to resign as chief minister amid the ongoing political turmoil in Gujarat and his fellow rebel former BJP MLA Dilip Parikh became CM
 paarikh kii sarkaar bhi lambey samay tak nahin chali or 1998 main gujarat vidhansabha ke liye nae sire se chunaav karana padaa
 Vaghela did not contest this election
 unhone apni nai party kaa congress main vilay kar diya
 The BJP returned to power in Gujarat with a thumping majority in 1998 and Keshubhai Patel again became CM
 waghela 1999 or 2004 main kapadvanj loksabhaa seat se se congress ke ummidavaar ke rup main jite
 He was made a Union Minister in the UPA Government
 baad main kapadvanj seat parisemen main panchmahal seat ho gai or waghela 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main panchmahal seat se haar gaye the
 He contested and won the Kapadvanj seat in the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly
 waghela gujarat vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa bane
 Along with this, he was also the President of Gujarat Congress
 unhone gujarat main sabarkantha loksabhaa seat se 2014 main chunaav ladaa or bhaajapa ummidavaar deepasingh shankarasingh rathod se haar gaye
 He quit the Congress in July 2017 with 13 mlas and stepped down as the Leader of the Opposition in the Gujarat Legislative Assembly
 congress chhodane ke turant baad unhone 2017 ke gujarat vidhansabha chunaav se pehle jan vikaas morcha naam se ek nayaa sanghathan shuru kiya
 Since his organization was not registered in the Election Commission, he fielded 95 candidates on the All India Hindustan Congress Party ticket
 chunaav main unki party koi bhi seat nahin ji pai
 Now he has moved to Sharad Pawar's NCP

 Gori Tere Pyaar is a cinematic adaptation of a very weak and confusing story, whose first half, which happens in the city of Bangalore, is somewhat tolerable, but as soon as Ghori falls in love, Chora gets dung
 
 yahaan aise gaanv banaaya or dikhaaya jaataa he, jaise koi vilayati babu jo peshey se set diziner ho, kisi painting or kuch ek saath ke dashak main bharat par banaai gai docyamentry filmein dekhne ke baad gaanv kii kalpana kar rahaa ho

 In the same way, in a very backward village, you should not be surprised to see the villagers who are chirping at the song Chingam because Chori is Chichori, Chhora is also Chhichora and now all these things are being explored in the film village

 At the same time, a 47-year-old woman reached near the temple's womb, Nadappandhal, but the devotees chanted Swami Sharanam Ayyappa and prevented her from entering there
 police ne bataaya ki ye mahilaayein kerala main mandir ghoomane aae shraddhaluon ke group kaa hissaa thim

 com / 1btgt2toje— GURMEET RAM RAHIM (@gurmeetramrahim)december 24, 2014 After the humiliating defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, nothing is going well for the Congress
 desh kii satta par sabase zyada samay kabiz rahane vaali congress kii ab haalat aisi he ki wo abhi bina kaman ke he
 Rahul Gandhi has also resigned from the post of president
 saath hi party ke kai varisht netaa apane-apane padon se istipha de chuke hai
 Its effect is also visible on the functioning of the party
 sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki haar ke baad congress kharch main katautee ko majaboor he, party ke kai ikaiyon ko die jane vaale fund main katautee kiye jane kii bhi khabar he
 Congress cut expenses! Sources are reported to have cut the monthly expenses of Congress Seva Dal
 party ab congress seva dal ko dhai lakh kii jagah 2 lakh rupee maheenaa de rahi he
 The accompanying party also asked the Mahila Congress, National Students Union of India (NSUI) and Youth Congress to cut expenses
 sutron ke mutabik congress mukhyalay main kaam rahe karmchaariyon ko haar ke baad ab tak vetan nahin mila he, sirf congress sanghathan ke karmchaariyon ko vakt par tankhwaah mili
 Also, out of 55 employees of the party's social media department, only 35 remain
 loksabhaa chunaav main mili haar ke baad soshal media vibhaag ke kai karmchaaree pehle hi chhodkar chale gaye
 The remaining employees were also given late salary
 kaaryvahak adhyaksh pad par jald faislavahin, party ke ek varisht sutara ne shuukravaar ko ieenes ko bataaya ki seedblusi kii baithak ke liye aane vaale dinon main ek taarikh tay kii jaaegi
 In which the decision will be taken on the acting president of the party
 netritv sankat ke bich, congress ke puraane or varisht sadasyon ne upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi se asthai rup se pad sanbhaalane kaa aagrah kiya, lekin unhone kathith taur par kharaab swasthya kaa hawala dete hue anurodh thukraa diya
 The names of several senior leaders are running for the post of acting president
 inamen mukul vaasanic, mallikarjun khadge, jyotiraditya sindhiya or susheel kumaar scindia shaamil hai
 Scindia, however, said that he is not in the race for the top post
 congress main dikhaa bikharaav, kai ne chodi partivahin, is siyaasi uthaa-patake ke bich 134 saal puraani party congress main bikharaav hota dikhaai de rahaa he
 mlas and leaders in states have started breaking ties with the party amid turmoil at the party's top leadership level
 pichley ek maheene se telugana, karnataka or goa main kai congress vidhayakon ne party chodi he
 The party's biggest setback came in Karnataka, where the Congress has lost power
 karnataka main chah july ke baad congress ke 79 vidhayakon se main 13 vidhayak apana istipha de chuke hai, jisase pradesh main 13 maheene puraani gathbandhan sarkaar ke liye sankat paidaa ho gaya he
 In Goa, 10 mlas left the party on 17 July under the leadership of Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Chandrakant Kavlekar
 congress ke yah 10 vidhayak bijepi main shaamil ho gaye hai jisase sattadhari party ke paas ab vidhansabha main 27 vidhayak ho gaye hai
 The Congress has only five mlas left in the 40-member Goa assembly
 isse ek maheenaa pehle telugana main party ke 18 vidhayakon main se 12 ne party chhodkar telugana raashtra samiti kaa daaman tham liya tha
 The Congress party suffered a crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections 2019
 542 sansadeey siton main se party mahaj 52 siten hi jeet saki
 Congress president Rahul Gandhi himself could not save his parliamentary seat Amethi
 unhen vahaan se bhartiya janata party kii pratyaashee raheen smriti irani se haar mili
 However, Rahul Gandhi won from Wayanad parliamentary seat in Kerala
 saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main kagress ko karaari haar mili thi
 Seven Republican members, under pressure from House leaders, dropped an amendment resolution protecting the rights of homosexuals, despite slogans of shame, shame on Democrat members in the US parliament
 sadan main hangaame ke baad maton ke bich kaa antim antar 213-212 kaa rahaa, jo sadan ke sadsy seen petric meloni (democrate-neuyork) kii ore se laae gaye sanshodhan ko naamanzoor karne ke liye kaaphi tha
 The purpose of this amendment was to uphold a legislative order that prohibits discrimination on behalf of federal contractors with LGBT employees
 meloni or anya democrate gusse main aa gaye
 Rajimelloni, who was doing the voting, said, he pulled discrimination from the jaws of equality
 unhone kaha ki vah memaurity leader or california se republican pratinidhi kevin maikaarthi se baat karne pahunche kyonki maikaarthi republican sahakarmiyon ko is sanshodhan ke khilaaf matdaan karne ke liye raji karne par kaam kar rahe the
 She herself admitted to being gay, mccarthy asked Melony to return to her seat
 meloni ne kaha, maine unase poocha, samanta ke paksh main khadaa hone ke liye mujhe kis taraf khadaa hona chahie? apane samalangik hone kii baat spasht taur par sweekaar karne vaale neuyork ke is pehle samalangik congress sadsy ne kaha, yah sharmnaak tha
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address eight more rallies before the third and fourth phases of the Bihar Legislative Assembly
 is jaankaree ke baad un atakalon ko viraam lag gaya he, jo 16 oktober ko baxur, paliganj or vaishali main modi kii jansabhaon ke radd hone ke baad se lagaai ja rahi thim
 Polling in these three places is to be held on October 28
 tisare-chauthe charan ke liye 4-4 reliyambijapi kii bihar ikaike adhyaksh mangal pandeya ne kaha ki modi tisare charan ke matdaan se pehle 4 or chauthe charan ke matdaan se pehle bhi itani hi reliyon ko sambodhit karenge

 chauthe charan main 55 vidhansabha siton ke liye votingbihar main chauthe charan main 55 vidhansabha siton ke liye pehali november ko matdaan hoga
 Modi addressed 11 rallies in Bihar before the first and second phase of voting
 in charnon main vidhansabha kii 81 siton ke liye matdaan ho chuke hai
 The plan for the first 40 rallies was PM Modi, who specializes in the art of speech, had earlier planned to hold 40 meetings in Bihar
 haal ke dinon main kisi pradhanmantri ne itani reliyon ko sambodhit nahin kiya he
 However, after the cancellation of some of Modi's rallies, his anti-grand Alliance said that it has happened because the BJP has agreed that it is losing the election
 isse pehle kisi bhi pradhanmantri ne vidhansabha chunaav main prachaar ke liye do yaa teen baar se adhik bihar kaa daura nahin kiya tha

 There is growing conflict between Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav on the issue of note closure
 argedy ke upaadhyaksh raghuvansh prasad singh ne guuruuvaar ko nitish kumaar par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki jis tareeke se nitish ne note bandi kaa mudde par pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa samarthan kiya he vah galat he or isse mahagathbandhan kamjor hua he
 In an exclusive conversation with 'nitish trying to get closer to BJP' today, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said that by supporting the central government on the note closure, it has become clear that Nitish Kumar will once again return to join hands with BJP
 Looking for his way singh ne kaha ki is baat ke bhi asaar hai ki nitish waapas endie main chale jaaen
 'mahagathbandhan has become weak' Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said, 'nitish Kumar and BJP have a 17 year old relationship
 kyonki nitish kumaar ne note bandi par pradhanmantri kaa samarthan kiya he, is baat ko bal miltaa he ki vah waapas bhaajapa ke saath haath mila sakate hai
 It is wrong to support factionalism and this has weakened the grand coalition government of Bihar
 'jadyu ne kaha- maansik santulan kho chuke hai raghuvanshraghuvansh prasad singh ke bayaan ko mahagathbandhan sarkaar ke liye fajihat bataate hue he janata dal united ne kaha ki unke bayaan se yah baat sabit ho gai he ki vah apana maansik santulan kho chuke hai
 JDU spokesman Sanjay Singh also wondered why RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav is silent despite Raghuvansh Prasad Singh's constant attack on Nitish Kumar? JDU demanded Raghuvansh Prasad Singh taking the statements seriously Lalu Prasad Yadav should show him the way out of the party
 'raghuvansh ko party se baahar karen lalu'jad you pravaktaa sanjay singh ne kaha, 'yah baat kaaphi ascharyajanak he ki aakhir lalu prasad yadav apane party ke netaa raghuvansh prasad singh ke lagaataar aa rahe bayanon par chup kyon he
 From such statements, it seems Raghuvansh Prasad has lost his mental balance
 aise bayanon se mahagathbandhan sarkaar kii fajihat hoti he
 Lalu should immediately bring Raghuvansh Prasad Singh out of the party
