 There is going to be a contest of thorns for the Karnataka assembly elections
 sattarudh party congress sabase badi party ke taur par ubharne ja rahi he lekin purna bahumat ke aankade se kuch siten dur rah sakati he
 According to the India today-karvy Insights Opinion Poll, the JDS may play the role of kingmaker in the event of a hung assembly
 jaanate hai pole se judi 10 khaas baaten
 
 
 Ten important findings of Opinion Poll 1
 congresskarnataka main sabase badi party ke taur par ubhar kar saamne aa rahi he, lekin bahumat ke aankade se ye phir bhi darjan bhar siton se peeche rah jaaegi
 According to Karvy's estimate, the Congress is going to get 90-101 seats in the 224-seat assembly
 2
 BJP is likely to be in second place with 78-86 seats
 ye aankada karnataka main sarkaar banane ke aankade se kareeb 30 seat kam he
 3
 devegoda kii jedies rajya main kingmekar kii bhoomika main saamne aa sakati he
 Karvy estimates that the JDS may gain 34–43 seats in Karnataka
 congress or bijepi donon ko hi agali sarkaar banane ke liye jedies kii madad kii jarurat padegi
 4
 jab jedies samarthak votaron se poocha gaya ki trishanku vidhansabha kii sthiti main gauda ko kis party ke saath janaa chahie to uske jawaab main sarvaadhik 39% votaron ne kaha ki jedies ko congress ko samarthan dena chahie
 5
 vot share par nazar daalen to karnataka main kaante kii ladaai hone kaa sanket miltaa he
 There is a difference of only 2% in the vote share of the two main parties
 pole main istemaal margin of erar bhi itnaa hi he
 The Congress has a possible vote share of 37%, while the BJP has 35%
 pole dikhaata he ki 49 siton par jeet-haar kaa antar bahut kam rah saktaa he
 6
 karnataka main mukhyamantri siddharmaiya kii ore se kiye gaye kaam ko lekar votaron kii acchhee raay he
 38% of the participants considered the Chief Minister's work as good or very good
 siddharmaiya ko rajya ke agle mukhyamantri ke taur par dekhne ke haq main sabase zyada votaron ne raay di he
 33% of voters consider Siddaramaiah as the first choice as Chief Minister
 bijepi ke yediurppa ko duusare number par yani 26% votaron ne mukhyamantri ke liye pehali pasand mana he
 7
 voter aisa maanate lagate hai ki rahul gandhi ke mandiron main jane se congress ko phayda milegaa
 42% of the voters believe that Congress will have good chances in the election because of Rahul's visit to temples
 haalanki kaante kii ladaai vaale chunaav main aakhri vakt main congress kis tarah khud ke liye sakaaratmak maahaul banaae rakhti he, is par bahut kuch nirbhar karegaa
 Any man axed like Mani Shankar Iyer or Chole Bhature can prove to be very damaging for the Grand Old Party
 8
 Old allegations of corruption against BS Yeddyurappa seem to be damaging the bjp's prospects
 40% pratibhaagiyon ne mana ki ye puraane aarope chunaav main bijepi ke khilaaf jaaenge
 9
 siddharmaiya ke ranneetik daanv jaise ki alag se rajya kaa jhanda, skulon main kannada ko anivaary bananaa, lingayat ko alag se alpsankhyak dharm kaa darja dena, ye sabhi congress ke liye chunavi nafaa pahunchaate dikh rahe hai
 10
 bijepi ke liye sabase acchhee ummid ye he ki congress karnataka main sarkaar banane ke liye jaruri saadhaaran bahumat se peeche rahe or bijepi phir jedies ke saath milakar sarkaar banaae
 However, Muslim supporters of JDS started to feel that if BJP could be supported by JDS, then they could also move towards Congress
 karnataka main 13% muslim voter hai

 It was a pleasure to see Railway Minister Piyush Goyal's tweet today
 unhone swatantraaa senaanee bipin chandra paal kii jayanti par yaad kiya he
 It is written that Bipin Chandra Pal will continue to inspire generations with his nationalism and revolutionary ideas
 koi vaaki krantikari vichaaron se prerit ho gaya or sarkaar ko chunauti dene laga, to sabase pehle piyush goyal hi use deshadrohi kah denge yaa unke samarthak yah kaam kar denge
 For a week, he was not inspired by any great man
 unke twit par kisi kii jayanti yaa punyatithi kaa samaran nahin he
 On October 31, he gets inspired by Sardar Patel through a tweet
 likhte hai, "unki ichhashakti faaulad jaisi drudh thi, desh ke liye unki patibaddhta adwitiya thi, unka sankalp atal tha
 
 
 Whatever work he got for the national interest, he completed it with full devotion
 
 
 "behatar hota, aap isi ke saath apni ichhashakti or mili hue kaary ko purna kar dikhaane kaa udhaaharan dete
 Remembering to congratulate on bhaiduj, Govardhan Puja, Dhanteras, Chhath, but do not remember to account for the work of the ministry
 akhir itane mahapurushon se jis shaks ko itani prerana mil rahi ho, to phir unka mantralay 15,000 se adhik ummidavaaron ko jwining letters kyon nahin de rahaa he
 
 
 The Why the railway minister who was inspired from Patel to Pal could not complete the examination process in 20 months
 
 
 ?farvari, 2018 main railway ne loko payalat or technitian kii bhartee nikaali thi
 20 months have passed, but still the process of this examination is not complete
 pariksha kaa riselt aa gaya he
 Documents have been verified after the results
 medical bhi ho chukaa he
 No more than 4,000 technicians have joined the Kolkata board itself
 1,409 loko payalat kii jwining nahin hui he
 They are sitting at home after passing the exam
 berojgaar hai
 According to the candidates, joining should have taken place by September
 ab november chaalu ho chukaa he
 The candidates from Allahabad Board have also written to me that candidates on 10,000 posts are waiting for appointment
 hazaron kii sankhya main chaatr intazaar kar rahe hai
 The process from document testing to medical examination has been completed
 jwining kab hogi, pataa nahin
 Is the government saving their money by putting them at home
 
 
 ? magar yah to dekhie ki din guzarane ke saath berojgaaron par kya musiibat hoti hogi
 
 
 ? a Gorakhpur board candidate has reported that there were 1,681 posts of loco pilots there
 1,377 padon par bhartee puri ho gai, lekin uske baad kaa pataa nahin chal paa rahaa he
 The technician's condition is worse
 unki jwining kaa panel tak nahin bana he
 There were 5,700 posts in Railway Recruitment Board, Mumbai, but the restoration of 600 has been completed
 jwining hui he
 4,100 candidates are still waiting
 behatar he, railmantri apana mul kaam karen
 i have an account of more than 20,000 candidates, who are waiting for appointment even after passing
 yah sankhya or bhi adhik ho sakati he
 The Minister is requested to give a joining letter to everyone within a week
 unhen vetan dena shuru karen
 If you do this much, then it is enough
 iske baad ve bhul bhi jaaen ki aaj kiski jayanti he, to kisi ko bura nahin lagegaa
 Sardar too will not mind, nor will Bipin Chandra Pal

 The main opposition Marxist Communist Party (CPI-M) in West Bengal has questioned the timing of the arrest of suspended Trinamool Congress MP Kunal Ghosh in the Saradha chit fund scam case
 makapa ne daawa kiya he ki ghotaale main mukhyamantri mamata banerjee kaa naam lene ke thik baad saansad kunal ghosh ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Mohammad Salim, a member of the CPI-M core committee, said, "the timing of the arrest tells a lot
" banerjee kaa naam liye jane ke baad agle din hi unhen (kunal) giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Now it has become extremely important to get the case investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
 ''majaak banakar rah gai jaanch'unhone aage bataaya, 'tab to vishesh jaanch dwaara is ghotaale kii ab tak kii gai jaanch ek majaak ban gai he, kyonki ab tak iskaa koi nateeja nahin nikal sakaa he
 Kunal was not only the Chief Executive Officer of the Sharda Media Group but has also held a key position in the Chief Minister's Secretariat for some time
 itane lambey samay tak na to banerjee or na hi jaanch adhikariyon ne uski (kunal) gatividhiyaan jaanane kii koshish kii
 Till now he has been questioned only once
 ''mamata kaa naam lete hi giraftaar hue kunal'saleem ne aage kaha, 'lekin jaise hi usne trinmul congress ke liye bura bhala kahana shuru kiya to jaanch adhikariyon ne us par shikanja kasnaa shuru kar diya
 And he was arrested as soon as he named Mamta Banerjee
 ''meri giraftaar ek sajeesh'vahiin apni giraftaar ko 'sajeesh' qaraar dete hue kunal ghosh ne kaha ki police ko maamle main sach kaa pataa lagane ke liye pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee or unki party ke do netaaon kii madad leni chahie
 Apart from Mamta, Ghosh asked 11 other people to get help
 inamen trinmul ke mahasachiv mukul roy, khelmantri madan mitra or party ke saansad suvendu adhikari ke naam shaamil hai
 Ghosh posted on Facebook, in a post posted on Facebook, "the investigation should take help of those who know Sen (saradha Group owner Sudipta Sen) and who took direct or indirect help from Sharda group
 Or know some things differently
 ’ unhone saath hi kaha ki vah kisi ke upar koi aarope nahin laga rahe
 In Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh, a man strangled his wife and son to death
 use shaq tha ki uski patni ke kisi gairmard ke saath avaidh sambandh hai
 The accused hails from Karnal district of Haryana
 police ne aaropee kii patni or bete kii laash uski car se baraamad kii he
 The Saharanpur police had received information that a suspicious white car was parked in the Gagalhedi police station area on the Dehradun highway
 police ne maukey par jaakar dekha to car main ek mahila or bachche kii laash padi thi
 Blood was spilled inside the car
 donon kii galaa retakarahatyaki gai thi
 a man was lying unconscious in the car
 police ne panchnaame ke baad mahila or bachche kaa shav postmortem ke liye bhej diya
 And the unconscious person was brought to the police station
 hosh main aane par us shaks ne police ko bataaya ki haridwar se aate vaqt do logo ne usase lift maangi thi
 He made them sit in the car
 un donon yuvakon ne uski patni or bachche kii galaa retkar hatya kar di
 The police could not believe the story of that young man
 kyonki vahaan koi lut nahin hui thi
 Police recovered from the documents recovered from the youth that he hailed from Aivla village of Butana, Thana in Karnal district of Haryana
 uskaa naam vijay he
 The deceased was his 30-year-old wife Seema and 5-year-old son Jashn
 iske baad police ne vijay se kadai se poochtacha kii, vijay police kii sakhti ke aage tut gaya or usne police ko sachai bataa di
 In fact, Vijay suspected that his wife Seema had an illicit relationship with a non-resident
 or uskaa betaa jashn uski aulad nahin he
 In the same doubt, he conspired to kill both of them
 sajeesh ke tahat vah donon ko lekar uttar pradesh ke saharanpur main aayaa
 On the way, he drank both by mixing sleeping pills in tea and milk
 jisase wo donon so gaye
 After this, he stitched both of them inside the car and put them to death
 aaropee ke mutabik vah shavon ko kahin thikaane lagane kii firaaq main tha
 But upon seeing the police checking in Saharanpur, he got scared and turned his car towards the forest
 jahaan car ko sandigdh dekhakar gaanv waalon ne police ko khabar kar di
 The police have arrested the accused
 esaspi manoj tiwari ne bataaya ki sirf avaidh sambandhon ke shaq main hi is hatya kii vaardaat ko anjaam diya gaya he
 After many times, this question comes to mind that whether this accident could have been avoided? Even after the Muzaffarnagar train accident, many people may have thought this, but the bitter truth is that the Khatauli train accident could not be averted
 kyonki ek do jagah nahin, balki kadam-kadam par railway ke ejeeniyar, afasar, karmchaaree laaparvaahee kii ganga main dubkee laga rahe the
 The report of the Joint Investigation Team that arrived for investigation after the accident is eye-opening
 is report ko padhane ke baad to yah kahkar bhi dil ko tasalli nahin di ja sakati ki agar yah na hua hota, to haadasa hone se batch jaataa
 Because Khatauli had such a mesh of railway negligence woven in which the death of passengers was fixed
 ajtak ke haath lagi joint invastigeshan team kii reportajtak ko joint invastigeshan team kii report haath lagi he
 There have been many shocking revelations in this report
 saath hi is baat kaa bhi khulaasa hua he ki hajaaron-lakhon logon ko safar karaane valirel ke trek par kis kadar laaparvaahee bartijati he
 The joint report claimed that the accident occurred due to the railway line being cut and a gap in it, but the reasons behind it were shocking
 jis trek se sau kilometre se bhi zyada kii raftaar se musafiron se bhari train guzarani ho, vahaan railway ke mentanence ejeeniyar kis tarah laaparvaahee se trek ko kaat dete hai
 Irresponsible officers remain unaware of this, which is highlighting a terrible lapse of the railway's security system
 itani soochna ko jis beparwahee se aage paas kiya jaataa he, control room main baithe karmchaaree bhi usee laaparvaahee ke andaaj main andekha kar dete hai
 Its brunt is in the shape of Khatauli train accident
 railway trek par marammat ke dauraan kii prakriya kaa nahin kiya gaya paalanjoint invastigeshan team kii report ishaara kar rahi he ki railway trek par marammat ke vakt jo tay prakriya yani standard aaparating proscisger apanaaya janaa chahie tha, usamen se kisi kaa bhi paalan nahin kiya gaya, jabaki ye kaam jaan-maal ke jokhim se judaa hua tha
 According to the statement of JE Mohanlal Meena, a JE engaged in repair work during the investigation, a 20-minute block was sought on the track so that no train would pass through that track for twenty minutes, but the control room either ignored it or else The demand for this blockage was not taken seriously
 trek par red flag bhi nahin lagayis laaparvaahee ke baad bhihadasatala ja saktaa tha, lekin laaparvaahiyon kaa silsilaa thama hi nahin
 According to the rules of the railway, whenever a repair is done on the track, a banner flag ie red flag is put on the track, but the working people also did not follow this rule
 agar jhanda laga hota, to train ke driver ko sanket mil jaataa or haadase ko taala ja saktaa tha yaa phir kam se kam janmaal ke nuksaan se bachaa ja saktaa tha, lekin jis jhande ko chetavanee ke liye trek par lagaaya janaa chahie tha, wo haadase vaali jagah par fold kiya hua mila
 The interesting thing involved in the senior engineer inquiry committee of the department responsible for the accident is that in the investigation report, the Permanent Way department has been held responsible for the accident and a senior engineer of the same department reached the spot to investigate the accident
 Were also involved in p-way vibhaag ke SSE yani senior section ejeeniyar is cameti kaa hissaa the, lekin jaise hi jimmedaari unheen ke vibhaag par aayi, to unhone report par apane dastakhat hi nahin kiye

 dharm sansad main adhyakshata kar rahe shankaracharya swaroopanand saraswati ke pratinidhi swami avimukteshwaranand ne 'ajtak' se baatcheet main kaha ki dharm sansad ke liye sabhi dalon ko nyotaa diya gaya he taaki ram mandir nirmaan ko lekar unki raay janata ke saamne aae
 Swami Avimukteshwaranand said that through the Dharma Sansad, it would be decided that the Sadhu Sannyasis would not withdraw from the Dharma Sansad until the date of commencement of construction of the Ram temple was known

 TMC President and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee attended the Iftar party on Monday amid the ongoing rage between BJP and TMC over Jai Shri Ram in West Bengal
 is party kaa aayojan kolkata municipal corporation ne kiya tha
 It is worth mentioning that a day ago, by writing a long wide post on the social site Facebook, Mamta Banerjee gave clarification on the controversy over the name Ram
 vahiin bijepi netaaon ne unhen ram naam kaa jaap karne kii salaah di thi
 Mamta had said that she had no problem with the slogan of any political party
 bijepi dharmik naare jai shri ram kaa raajnneetik istemaal kar rahi he
 We will not tolerate any attempt to impose such political slogans
 didi ne likhaa tha ki logon ko bataanaa chaahati hum ki bijepi ke samarthak phek video, phek news ke jariye phek suchanaaen failaa rahe hai
 An atmosphere of confusion is being created by this
 raja ram mohan raay se laker vidyasagar tak bengal mahaan samaaj sudhaarkon kaa sthal rahaa he, lekin bijepi apni ranneeti ke jariye bengal main nakaaratmakataa failaa rahi he
 He wrote that if a party chants a special slogan in its rallies, then they have no problem
 har raajnneetik dal kaa apana naaraa he, meri party kaa naaraa jai hind or vande maataram he, vamadal inkulab jindabad kehete hai, duusari partiyon kaa doosraa naaraa he, ham ek duusare kaa sammaan karte hai
 Accusing the BJP of mixing religion and politics, Didi said that the BJP was doing negative politics

 Today Varun Gandhi is reaching Pilibhit, under tight security, Varun will file his nomination today
 enese ke aarope or supreme court se perol par rihaai ke baad pilibhit main aaj varun kii maujuudagi par sabaki nazren gadi hui hai
 People in Pilibhit are waiting for Varun Gandhi again today
 bijepi kaaryakarta or tamaam bade netaa varun ke saath hai, to chunaav ayog bhi pilibhit par camaron ke alaava har tarah se nazren gadaaye baitha he
 The reason is that Varun Gandhi is going to file his election papers in Pilibhit today
 varun, jin par enese kaa aarope baaki he, jinhen supreme court se do hafte kii perol mili he
 When Varun reached Bareilly on Tuesday, he did not open his tongue, reached home without saying anything, accepted the greetings of the workers at the door of the house and went quietly into the house
 maa menka bhi saath thim, koi kuch nahin bol rahaa
 Perhaps Varun remembers the instructions of the Supreme Court and the advice of big leaders like Advani and Rajnath
 28 march ke sarender ke baad varun ko 16 april ko hi supreme court se perol mili, or usee din shaam ko eta jail se varun ko reeha kar diya gaya
 Even on that day Varun kept quiet
 dilli main bijepi ke tamaam aalaa netaaon se bhi mili, or sabane yahi kaha hoga, ki varun halafname par kaayam rahanaa, kyonki perol kaa matlab enese se chhutkaaraa nahin
 The NSA is yet to hear
 is sab ke bich pilibhit main aaj kaa din ahm he
 Everyone has their eyes on what Varun speaks and how much he speaks
 dilli kaa pradooshan sehat ke liye behad khatarnaak ho gaya he
 You can guess this from the fact that in the last few months people are leaving Delhi to avoid pollution
 taaja maamla bharat main costarika kii ambesder mariela krooj alvarej se judaa he
 Became sick of the pollution of Vedilli
 pareshaan alvarej dilli chhodkar bengaluru pahunch gai hai
 He has mentioned this on his blog
 unhone likhaa ki, " dilli ke pradooshan ne meri sehat kharaab kar di he
 i found this out when i arrived in Bangalore
 yahaan aate hi main biimaar ho gai
 In another blog post, he warned people about the dangers of pollution, wrote that the earth is being destroyed by pollution
 main bharat se pyaar karti hum, lekin pradooshan se biimaar ho gai
 We have to deal with this
 "bataa den ki mariela ke alaava bhi kai deshon ke ambesder dilli chhodane kii planning kar rahe hai
 Thailand ambassador Chutitron Gongsakdi even wrote a letter to Bangkok officials last week, asking him to be given a 'hardship allowance' to stay in Delhi as Delhi's pollution worsened his health
 maaloom ho ki hardship alouns afghanistan, iraq or syria jaise kathin paristhitiyon vaale deshon main posted hone vaale ambasadaron ko diya jaataa he
 In this interview, Mexican ambassador Melba Priya said in an interview to a news channel that, "it has become difficult to live in Delhi due to pollution
 raajnneeti se pareshaan hokar nahin balki pradooshan se pareshaan hokar dilli chhodane kaa vichaar kar rahi hum
 Now the country will have to rise above politics to reduce pollution, because now our family is concerned
 " Amid reports of a major setback to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Kabullet traindream project, the Central Government has clarified that no decision has been taken to stop funding for the bullet train project
 yah safai kendra sarkaar shaamil rajya sarkaron kii ek joint venture company he jise bullate train project kii jimmedaari di gai he
 a leading English newspaper had claimed that the Japan International Cooperation Agency (zika), the Japanese company funding the bullet train project, had stopped funding for the bullet trail network

 'zika is the agency of the Government of Japan and it sets socio-economic policies internationally for the Government of Japan

 In addition to this compensation, farmers in both states have placed a condition for giving land that the government should ensure common facilities in these areas as well as arrangements for hospitals and doctors at the village level, including shared ponds, schools, solar lights
 is report ke baad sarkari company ne daawa kiya he ki media main prakashit aisi khabaren galat he
 According to the government, Zika has not taken any such decision
 vahiin sarkaar company ne daawa kiya ki bharat sarkaar or jika ke bich 10 billian yen kaa lone agreement kiya ja chukaa he or jika kii taraf se project ke liye koi bhi fund maujuuda samay tak pending nahin he
 On the problem of farmers, it has been said that the company is aware of the problem of the farmers affected by this project and the company is fully responsible for the farmers affected
 monsoon kaa aakhri daanv kahin tham na le modi sarkaar ke liye voton kii barishgauratlab he ki 508 kilometre kii bullate train pariyojna main lagbhag 110 kilometre kaa safar maharashtra ke palghar se gujarata he or kendra sarkaar ko yahaan ke kisaanon se jameen lene main kadi chunauti kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 At the same time, in Gujarat also, the government has to acquire about 85 de hectares of land from 5000 farmer families spread over eight districts
 bullate train project jahaan kendra sarkaar kaa dream project he vahiin isaki funding karne vaali japani agency ne abhitak mahaj 125 karod rupee jari kiye hai
 As per the agreement between India and Japan, to complete the project by 2022, Japan has to invest around Rs 80,000 crore while the remaining Rs 20,000 will be invested by the Central Government in the scheme
 ab funding rokane ke japan ke faisle ke baad niti ayog or vitt mantralay ke paas is project ko samay se puraa karne ke liye vikalp kii kami he
 The two-hour long meeting at the Prime Minister's residence on inflation was inconclusive
 koi faisla nahin liya ja sakaa
 The only decision was that there would be another meeting the next day
 subah saadhe das baje pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke bulaave par sarkaar ke teen bade mantri pahunche the
 Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and Home Minister p Chidambaram
 pehle hi media ko bataa diya gaya tha ki kuch faisle liye ja sakate hai, isliye press conference bhi hona tha
 Journalists were also called inside pm's residence, but two hours later, it was told that the meeting is not yet over completely, it will also be on Wednesday
 yani mahangaai par sarkaar ke mukhiya or unke sipahasalaron ne do ghante tak maathapai kii or phir ek or meeting kii prishthbhumi rakhi gai
 Earlier in the middle meeting, Pranab Mukherjee got up and left
 yah kaha gaya tha ki unka pehle se kaarykram he, isliye ja rahe hai

 As soon as the election bugle starts in the country, there is a big increase in arrivals in Kolkata's Malik Ghat Flower Market and Ghazipur Phool Mandi in Delhi
 baat jab deepawali kii ho to in donon bazaaron main saans lenaa bhi kaarobaariyon ke liye nuksaan sabit hota he
 Malik Ghat Market is Asia's largest flower market and Ghazipur mandi is the country's largest consumption market
 yahi vajah he ki chunaav ke vakt phool kii maang main itnaa bada ijapha dekhne ko miltaa he
 Why is this special Diwali this year Diwali is special in Delhi
 yahaan supreme court ke aadesh ke baad pataakhaa bechney par pratibandh laga hua he
 Therefore, this year, along with Safe Deepawali, the slogan of pollution-free Deepawali is also being raised
 choti deepawali or badi deepawali kii raat is saal aasmaan main pataakhe footte kam najar aaenge
 Like last year, children and old people will not have to admit in the hospital due to difficulty in breathing on the morning of Diwali
 phulon kii demand badhegi?bazaar se pataakhe gaayab hone ke chalate is deepawali dilli main phool or sajaavati saamaan kaa kaarobaar tej rahane kii ummid he
 Fake flowers (made of paper and plastic) for Deepawali have been selling for the past one month
 asli phulon kii thok supplai kar rahe gajipur mandi main kaarobaariyon ke liye bhi yah deepawali khaas he
 With the ban on firecrackers, they also hope to increase sales, so the preparations are complete that this time they can sell as much as possible in two days' business
 iske liye lagbhag sabhi kaarobaariyon ne apni aam aadhat se 5 guna adhik phool kaa order diya he
 Also read: 'nationalist' boycott of Chinese firecrackers and fighters will not work? Flowers will be sold at 5 times the price? The direct rule of business in Ghazipur mandi
 yahaan phool kii supplai fiks he
 The demand fluctuations are high and the biggest risk is that if a flower is not sold in a few hours, then a foreign flower of 100 rupees (from Thailand) lying in front of them will also wither away
 lihaaja bazaar main jaise hi phool kii demand tej hoti he, keemton main automatic ijapha hone lagata he

 andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri en
 When Chandrababu Naidu decided to contest elections in Telangana in coordination with the Congress in the recent past, his close associates did not take any time to understand that Naidu has made strides towards interfering in the national politics of 2019
 yadi ve khud ko andhra pradesh tak simit rakhane kii soch rahe hote to us congress ke saath telugana main talmail nahin karte jise (congress) andhra pradesh ke bantwaare ke liye rajya kii janata jimmevaar maanati he
 Telangana became a separate state, Andhra had no majority in its favor
 pichley chunaav main janata ne congress ko rajya ke bantwaare ke liye sajaa bhi di or apane majboot garh rahe andhra main congress na to loksabhaa, na hi vidhansabha main koi seat jeet saki
 Actually Chandrababu Naidu is a leader who has played his role several times at the central level
 endie, upie or fedral front main unki mahatvapurn bhoomika rahi he
 But Rajasekhara Reddy, the Congress chief minister in Andhra Pradesh, pushed Naidu to the margins in the 2004 and 2009 Lok Sabha and Assembly elections
 rajasekhar reddy ke nidhan ke baad congress rajya main ladkadaane lagi
 Naidu then contested the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in 2014 in alliance with the BJP and was successful in forming the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) government
 naidu ne isi saal andhra ko vishesh rajya kaa darja nahin die jane par modi sarkaar se naata tod liya
 With this decision of Naidu, the hope of anti-bjp parties, especially Congress, with a view to central politics, strengthened for 2019
 bhaajapa virdohi dal yah jaanate hai ki andhra main bina naidu ke bhaajapa kuch khaas karne kii sthiti main philhal nahin he
 Politicians who are sitting on the imagination of the Federal Front are also seeing a strong partner in the form of Naidu
 modi virdohi dal yah maanakar chal rahe hai ki dakshin main modi ke khilaaf dakshin gaurav kii baat kar naidu dakshin bharat ke siyaasi dalon ko apane paksh main khadaa kar sakate hai
 Naidu is slowly advancing his game plan but his rival YSRC Congress leader Jaganmohan Reddy is also not sitting quietly
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main ve 67 seat jeetne main safal rahe the
 This time Jaganmohan may tie up with the BJP
 jagan jaanate hai ki rashtriya raajnneeti se pehle rajya main pair jamaana jaruri he
 Chandrababu Naidu, the center strategist, Chandrababu Naidu, the chief of the state and the Chief Minister of the state, Chandrababu Naidu was the first in the Congress
 1982 main anti ramarao ne jab telugudesham party banaai to bhi naidu congress main bane rahe
 In the 1983 Andhra Pradesh Assembly elections, Naidu contested against the TDP candidate but lost
 baad main ve tidipi main shaamil ho gaye
 Naidu's political skills were revealed when TDP leader N
N
 bhaskar raav ne antiaar ke khilaaf vidroh kar diya
 Chandrababu re-united the TDP mlas who had rebelled against NTR at the time and paraded before the President
 31 din baad antiaar ko dobaaraa rajya kaa mukhyamantri behaal kiya gaya
 After this incident, Naidu's stature rose sharply in the TDP and NTR made him the General Secretary of the party
 baad main jab antiaar ne lakshmi parvati se shaadi kar lee to naidu, antiaar ke khilaaf ho gaye or unhone tidipi vidhayakon ko apane paale main kar liya or rajya ke mukhyamantri bane
 Leader of Opposition in the Jaganmohan Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly
 ve rajya ke purv mukhyamantri rajasekhar reddy ke putr hai
 Originally a Congressman
 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main unhone congress ke liye kadappa jile main prachaar kiya
 In 2009, he was elected as an MP from Kadapa on a Congress ticket
 jab unke pita kii mrityu helicopter durghatana main ho gai to chah maheene baad unhone pita kii yaad main shradhanjali yatra shuru kii
 The Congress asked him not to travel but Jagan did not agree
 november 2010 main unhone congress chhod di
 Formed YSRC Congress in 2011
 2014 ke loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav main unhone acha pradarshan kiya lekin tidipi-bhaajapa gathbandhan se unki party chunaav haar gai
 In November last year to strengthen his position, he has traveled 3,000 km on foot
 charchaa he ki 2019 main ve bhaajapa ke saath mil kar chunaav lard sakate hai
 Annoyed by the state's bifurcation, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Kiran Kumar Reddy resigned in 2014, but now he has returned to the Congress again
 unki vaapasi se congress ko majbootee milane kii ummid jaagi he lekin congress ke khilaaf janata kii naaraazgi dur karne ke liye unhen bahut mehnat kerani hogi
 BJP President Kanna Laxminarayan of Andhra Pradesh has been posted this year
 kapu samudaay par acchhee pakad rakhane vaale kanna congressi rahe hai or paanch baar vidhayak or mantri bhi ban chuke hai
 The BJP has given him the command of the state in view of his experience and his ability to resist Naidu

 These days, there is news that the real reason behind Raghu and Rajiv's departure from the famous reality show 'roadies' is their bad behavior
 yahi nahin, khabaron kii maane to donon ko sho se nikaal baahar kiya gaya he, kyonki vah sho ke daura khub gaali-galoch karte hai or team ke saathiyon ke saath bhi unka bartaav kuch aisa hi rahata he
 But is it all true or just a rumor? sachai kii padtaal ke liye ajtak website kii team pahunchi sidherghuor rajeev ke paas
 In a special conversation, he told RJ Alokko how and why these news are false and his decision to separate from the show is his own
 kya he mudda? kya sach main aap donon ko 'rodies' se nikaala gaya he?raghu:yaar, ek afvaah udi he
 Don't know who said that me and Rajiv have been removed from Roadies
 kaaran bataaya gaya he ki meraa gusse vaala swabhaav he
 i abuse meri team mujhase pareshaan he
 She does not want to work with me, etc
 ye baaten mujhe bahut pareshaan karti hai or meri team ko kaaphi dukh he
 The channel people don't even know who said this
 unki taraf se bhi koi baat nahin hui he, lekin main or rajeev ye bataanaa chaahate hai ki jisane bhi ye afvaah udayi he, ye sab galat he
 Don't you both feel like in 'roadies' now? Raghu: See, there are two to three things
 sabase pehle to rajeev colocium company kaa head he, jo 'rodies' or 'splitsvilla' ke saath-saath 'master shef' or 'master shef junior' bhi produs karte hai
 If Rajiv did not have time, he left in season 9 and once in 10 he came only at my behest
 'rodies 11' main wo bhi nahin kiya
 My journey was over after 'roadies 10'
 maine darshakon ko by bhi bol diya tha
 Also wrote a book 'rare View of my Roadies Journey'
 channel ke saath meraa aisa rishta he ki maine sijan 11 kiya, lekin march main hi jab rodies 11 khatm hua to maine kah diya tha kii ab main nahin kar paaunga
 a monotony began to form
 ek hi tarah kaa kaam karnaa acha nahin lag rahaa tha
 The channel also agreed with us
 mujhe kaaphi khushi he ki is baar channel 'rodies' ke 12wein sijan main nae logon ke saath kaam karegaa
 Now whoever has spread this rumor, all those channels have no connection
 hamaari team se hamaara koi mudda nahin he, puri team hamaara saport kar rahi he
 We are happy
 ab aap log kya karenge?raghu:hamane apana khud kaa production house kholaa he, jahaan tivi, on ground or kaaphi brands ke saath baaten chal rahi hai
 Whatever our experience is for the Indian youth
 ham websites ke liye kaam karenge
 Intended to work in films? Raghu: We were fired (laughs) after 'tees Maar Khan'
 nahin, nahin
 We have two films coming out
 ek bobi bedi production or ek nagesh kukunur ke saath
 Talk is going on in many other places
 kya aap afvaah failaane vaale ke khilaaf manahani kaa daawa karenge?raghu:yaar saamne aakar bolo naa
 What is the need to speak backwards? ho saktaa he hamase koi galati ho gai ho
 But we have no such intention
 rajeev:film 'damini' main sani deol kaa ek dialog he, 'band pinjre main kaid sher par to bachche bhi moongfalee phenk dete hai

 ham aapako dilli se kareeb 700 kilometre dur upi ke sultanpur main sthit ek kamare kii kahani bataane ja rahe hai
 The memories of room number 105 of Hotel Garden View are associated with President Kovind
 kareeb chaar saal pehle kovind isi kamare main tehre the
 Kovind then came to Sultanpur to join the Run for Unity program as a BJP leader
 kovind ke raashtrapati banane ke saath hi hotel sanchaalak ne is kamare kii khaas saaj sajaavat karai
 Also named it 'president Kovind Suite'
 hotel sanchaalak ke daawey ke mutabik is kamare kii demand bahut zyada bad gai he
 The charge of this room has also been increased
 thahrie, isse pehle ki aap ise hotel sanchaalak kaa marketing kaa funda maanane lage, aapako bataa den ki kamare se hone vaali aamadani hotel khud nahin rakhata balki isepradhanmantri raahat koshmen bhejtaa he
 On 14 December 2013, Kovind stayed in room number 105 of Hotel Garden View
 tab kisne sochaa hoga ki kovind aage chal kar desh ke raashtrapati banenge
 According to hotel operator Sandeep Srivastava, when the NDA announced Kovind's name for the presidency, Kovind's visit to Sultanpur four years ago came into his mind automatically
 unhone hotel main thaharne vaale customers kaa record khangala to 14 disambar 2013 kaa bill bhi mil gaya jisame kovind ke naam kaa ullekh tha
 The hotel operator has now completely changed the furnishing of room number 105
 yahaan kovind kii photo ke saath ve kab se kab tak is kamare main ruke the, iskaa byoraa bhi diya gaya he
 Customers also ask for a different pleasant experience when staying in the room
 sharad shrivastav naam ke customer ne bataaya, “maine ek site ke jariye hotel booking kaa opshan dekha
 Two or three hotels were seen
 mujhe kamaron ke hisaab se hotel garden vyuu kaa vikalp acha laga
 i came here at night and checked in, so i did not know in which room i was going to go
 room main maine jaakar dekha ki vahanmananeey raashtrapati kovindka chitra laga hua tha
 They stayed here for one night on 14 December 2013
 ”dubai me rahane vaale meraaj ahamed ne bhi kuch aisa hi anubhav sunaaya
 According to Meraj, he came to know about the suit in the Garden View Hotel in the name of President Kovind
 hotel sanchaalak kii is pahal kaa sabase acha pahalu yahi he ki suit se jo bhi aamadani hogi wo pradhanmantri raahat kosh main bheja jayega jo ki jaruratmandon ke kaam aegi
 Senior BJP leader LK Advani told the media after meeting Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat in Nagpur that the Cash for Vote scandal was the biggest scam in the country
 adwani ne kaha ki unke jivan kaa udyeshy saaf-suthri raajnneeti karnaa rahaa he
 He said that the preparations for the rath yatra have been completed and the yatra will be completed before the next session of Parliament
 sangh se apane kareebi rishte ke bare main adwani ne kaha ki main raajnneeti main baad main aayaa, pehle sangh se judaa tha
 He said that the blessings of the Sangh remained with me
 piem pad kii daavedaari ko lekar adwani ne kaha ki unhen sangh or duusare sanghathanon se jo mila he, wo piem pad se kahin zyada he
 Advani said that after the arrests in the 'cash for Vote' case, he has decided to undertake a nationwide tour against corruption and in this connection he has come here to meet Sangh chief and party president Nitin Gadkari
 unhone kaha ki is yatra ke liye unhen sangh kaa puraa samarthan or aashirwad praapt he
 The Sangh has also given instructions to its workers to make the yatra a success
 jab unase poocha gaya ki isse pehle aapane kai yatraaen kii hai to kya us samay bhi aapane sangh se aashirwad liya tha, to unhone kaha, yatra ko safal banane ke liye jin logon se samarthan kii jarurat padi, unase sahyog liya gaya
 There is often a formal and informal interaction with the Sangh
 cash for vot maamle ko swatantra bharat kaa sabase bada ghotaalaa qaraar dete hue adwani ne kaha ki sansad main 'vot ke liye note' maamle ke ujagar hone ke samay main loksabhaa main vipaksh kaa netaa tha or is maamle ko ujagar karne ke liye maine hi apane saansadon ko anumati di thi, aise main yadi ye purv saansad doshi hai to unase bada main doshi hum
 He said that he had found it appropriate to expose the matter, when he had allowed it to his colleagues
 varsh 2008 main vishwaas mat prastaav ke dauraan bhaajapa ke kuch saansadon main loksabhaa main noton kii gaddiyaan laharaate hue sarkaar ke paksh main vot dene ke liye rishwat die jane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 The former Deputy Prime Minister also met BJP President Nitin Gadkari and inquired about his health
 gadakari kaa 12 sitambar ko oparation hua he or vah swasthya laabh kar rahe hai
 Advani said, BJP president will come to Delhi on September 24
 maine unase yatra kii ghoshnaa karne kaa aagrah kiya he
 By then the travel plan will be completed
 jab unase yatra ke byore ke bare main poocha gaya to adwani ne kaha ki 11 oktober ko diggaj samaajawaadee netaa jaiprakash narayan kaa janmdin he or yah yatra shuru karne kii asthaayee tithi thi
 Sources say that the yatra will probably start from Sitab Diara in Saran district of Bihar
 sitab diyaara jepi kii janmasthali he
 Advani termed the meeting with Bhagwat as normal, saying that he kept meeting him informally
 purv up pradhanmantri ne kaha, ham un sabhi se bhent karte hai, jo yatra main koi bada yogadan kar sakate hai
 Advani said that he would go to BJP-NDA ruled states
 unhone is par jor diya ki kuch kamiyon ke baavjood ye rajya anya ke mukaable zyada acchhee tarah shasit hai
 The former Deputy Prime Minister said that he thought about the visit as the autumn session of Parliament did not run in 2010 on the opposition's demand for a vote scandal in lieu of the 2008 note and a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) probe into the 2G spectrum allocation scam
 adwani ne kaha ki yatra ke liye unki yojana tab drudh hui jab vicellabloar ke rup main kaam karte hue ghotaale kaa pardaafash karne vaale hamaare do saansadon ko jail bhej diya gaya, jabaki unhone ek acha kaam kiya tha or loktantr kii mahaan seva kii thi

 worldcup-1983 se judi jeet bhartiya cricket ke lihaaj se mile kaa pathar kahi ja sakati he
 When the Indian team reached England for the Prudential World Cup under the leadership of the legendary all-rounder Kapil Dev, he was not even considered a contender until he reached the semi-finals
 iske peeche kaaran varsh 1975 or 1979 ke worldcup main team india kaa pradarshan tha
 In the 1975 World Cup, the Indian team could only defeat East Africa
 england ne us samay bhartiya team par 200 ran se adhik ke antar se jeet hasil kii thi
 In this match, England's team scored a huge score of 334 runs in 60 overs
 1979 ke worldcup ke dauraan bhi team india kii yahi kahani lagbhag jari rahi or kamjor maani ja rahi srilanka ke khilaaf bhi use haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 However, the Indian team created history by completing all this cancer in the 1983 World Cup
 kapildev ke jambaajon ne final main team india ne westeindies ko haraakar vijeta trophy kar kabja jamaaya
 Almost every player in the team contributed something to this performance, but there was one player who, despite being very talented, could not play a match in the World Cup
 kai logon ko to shaayad yaad bhi nahin hoga ki kapil dev ke netritv main worldcup champion bani bhartiya team main tej gendbaaj sunil valsan bhi the
 Walson did not get a chance to play any match in the World Cup
 baat yaheen tak hoti to thik he
 Walson could not play any international match for India after this
 worldcup vijeta team ke sadsy hone ke baavjood unke khate main ek bhi interneshal match darj nahin he
 The comments kai purv khilaadi, sunil valsan ko pratibha se bharpoor cricketer maanate the
 Walson was a left-arm fast bowler representing Delhi and Railways in domestic cricket
 75 pratham shrenee ke maichon main 25
 212 wickets at an average of 35 are recorded in his name
 chah baar unhone paanch yaa isse adhik or ek baar 10 se adhik wicket hasil kiye
 In the domestic cricket matches, he dismissed the world's greatest opener Sunil Gavaskar
 har koi jaanata he ki sani apane wicket ke liye gendbaajon se kitni mehnat karaate the or unhen out karne kaa kaam koi saadhaaran gendbaaj nahin ho saktaa
 Walson was a left-arm bowler
 80 ke dashak yaa isse pehle bharat ke paas baayen haath ke gendbaaj bahut kam hue hai
 After Karsan Ghavri, there was no left-arm bowler in the Indian team for a long time
 is lihaaj se valsan team ke liye upyog sabit ho sakate the, lekin durbhaagya se unhen ek bhi international match khilne kaa mauka nahin mil paaya
 The reason behind this was the performance of Team India in the World Cup in 1975 and 1979
 1975 ke worldcup main bhartiya team mahaj purvi africa ko parajeet kar pai thi
 England then won the Indian team by a margin of over 200 runs
 is match main england kii team ne 60 over main 334 ran kaa vishaal score khadaa kiya tha
 The same story of Team India continued almost even during the 1979 World Cup and they had to face defeat against the deemed Sri Lanka
 baharhaal, bhartiya team ne yah tamaam kasar 1983 ke worldcup main puri karte hue itihaas rach diya
 Kapildev's jambajas captured the winning trophy after Team India defeated West Indies in the final
 is pradarshan main team ke lagbhag har khilaadi ne kuch na kuch yogadan diya, lekin ek khilaadi aisa tha jo behad pratibhavan hone ke baavjood worldcup main koi match nahin khel sakaa
 Many people may not even remember that the Indian team, led by Kapil Dev, was also the fast bowler Sunil Walson
 walsan ko worldcup main koi match khilne kaa mauka nahin mila
 If this thing were to happen here, it would be fine
 valsan iske baad bharat kii ore se koi international match bhi nahin khel paae
 Despite being a member of the World Cup winning team, there is not a single international match recorded in their account
 tippaniyan Many former players considered Sunil Walson a cricketer of talent
 gharelu cricket main dilli or railway kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale valsan baayen haath ke tej gendbaaj the
 25 in 75 first-class matches
 35 ke ausat se 212 wicket unke naam par darj hai
 Six times he took five or more and once more than 10 wickets
 gharelu cricket muqablon main unhone duniya ke mahaan openar sunil gavaskar ko out kiya
 Everyone knows how hard Sunny used to get the bowlers for their wickets and dismissing them cannot be an ordinary bowler
 valsan baayen haath ke gendbaaj the
 India have had very few left-arm bowlers since the 80s or earlier
 karsan ghavri ke baad bhartiya team main lambey samay tak koi baayen haath kaa gendbaaj nahin rahaa
 In this sense, Walson could prove to be of use to the team, but unfortunately he did not get a chance to play a single international match

 Rather, during the entire election campaign of Bihar Assembly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi used to ask the people in every meeting of theirs that electricity came
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav ke prachaar main vahi pradhanmantri narendra modi ab apane sahyogi or unki har sabha main manch par maujuud bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii har ghar bijli yojana kii tarif karne se nahin chookte
 On Thursday also in Darbhanga, Bihar, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that i congratulate Nitish ji that he has given away the lantern forever
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apane bhaashan ke dauraan guuruuvaar ko darbhanga main congress party ko gherte hue kaha ki agar aap 2004 ke unke menifesto ko dekhenge to unhone agle paanch saalon main yani ki 2009 tak har ghar bijli pahunchane kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin aap log bataaie kya ye vaada puraa hua? to agar ye vaada puraa nahin hua, agar har ghar bijli nahin pahunchi, to aap logon ke saath dhokhaa kiya gaya
 But with assuming power, i had targeted to deliver electricity to 18 thousand villages in 1 day and have fulfilled that promise
 isi sandarbh main unhone bihar main vidyutikaran ko lekar kaam kii charchaa karte hue kaha ki bihar main jaisaa kaam hua he pahaado main or jammu kashmir ke sudur ilaakon main usee ko apanaate hue bijli pahunchane kaa kaam kiya
 In fact, the scheme to provide electricity to every household in Bihar was not only completed before its time, but the central government also included its model in its Saubhagya scheme and this time Nitish Kumar makes electricity the main issue in every house of his house
 And it is said that when electricity has reached every house, what is the need of a lantern

 vivaadit sthal par mandir kaa todna aurangzeb ke samay hua na ki babar ke samay
 According to Kunal, in 1813, a Shia religious teacher manipulated the inscription according to which Mir Baqi built this mosque at Babur's behest
 kunal is shilaalekh ko farzi bataate hai
 They give evidence in support of everything in this book
 is kitaab ko padhakar lag rahaa he ki lekhak mandir nirmaan ke hinduvadi sanghathanon ke doharepan se bhi khinn hai 
 Kunal feels that he is more interested in politics than in the temple
 kishor kunal kaa daawa he ki is kitaab main mandir nirmaan ke paksh main sahi tathyon ko pesh kiya he
 Their effort is also to save the history of Ayodhya
 tippaniyan Someone associated with the temple construction section said that Babur was innocent
 uske khilaaf us aparaadh ke liye dashakon tak nafrat failaai gai jo usne kii hi nahin' koi maamuli baat nahin he
 Kunal Babar is called a liberal and a fearless warrior
 ham aap jaanate hai ki maujuuda raajnneeti main babar kaa naam lete hi kis kis tarah kii baaten zahan main ubhar aati hai
 Will they be able to digest these claims of the organization and leader Kunal, who did countless provocative arguments calling 'babri ki Auladon'? No water has been shed before and after the demolition of Babri Masjid
 kunal ne ayodhya kaa bada hi dilachasp itihaas likhaa he
 Worth a read
 kunal ke ayodhya main sirf ram nahin hai, rahim bhi hai
 In saving Ayoghya's history and declaring Babur as innocent, Kunal spent many years of his life in the archives, but how will the politics of witnessing the evidence accept the book of this Sanatani Ramanandi historian
 unki is kitaab ko padhate hue yahi soch rahaa hum ki kunal ke anusaar babar ne mandir nahin todaa, vah babari masjid nahin thi lekin ayodhya ke itihaas ko jin logon ne dhwast kiya ve koun the balki ve koun hai
 Where are they today and where is Ayodhya ?? mandir nirmaan kii dhara se jude kisi vyakti kaa yah kahana ki 'babar nirdosh tha
 For decades, hatred was spread against him for a crime that he did not commit
 kunal babar ko udaaravaadi or bemauf yoddha kehete hai
 You know what kind of things emerge in the current politics as soon as Babur is named
 kya ve sanghathan or netaa kunal ke in daavon ko pachaa paayenge jinhone 'babari kii auladon' kehete hue anginat bhadakaau takreeren kii thim? babari masjid dhwans ke pehle or baad main jamaane tak pani nahin koon baha he
 Kunal has written a very interesting history of Ayodhya
 padhane laayak he
 There is not only Ram, but also Rahim in Kunal's Ayodhya
 ayoghya ke itihaas ko bachaane or babar ko nirdosh bataane main kunal ne apni zindagi ke kai saal abhilekhagaaron main laga diye lekin saakshyon ko todane marodane vaali raajnneeti is sanatani ramandi itihaaskaar kii kitaab ko kaise sweekaar karegi
 While reading this book, i am thinking that according to Kunal Babur did not break the temple, it was not Babri Masjid, but the people who demolished the history of Ayodhya, who were they but who are they
 ve aaj kahaan hai or ayodhya kahaan he?? Kunal has written a very interesting history of Ayodhya
 padhane laayak he
 There is not only Ram, but also Rahim in Kunal's Ayodhya
 ayoghya ke itihaas ko bachaane or babar ko nirdosh bataane main kunal ne apni zindagi ke kai saal abhilekhagaaron main laga diye lekin saakshyon ko todane marodane vaali raajnneeti is sanatani ramandi itihaaskaar kii kitaab ko kaise sweekaar karegi

 ve aaj kahaan hai or ayodhya kahaan he?? Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting, Rajyavardhan Rathore, who reached the Information Against Propaganda session of Aaj Tak Editors Roundtable, said that social media is the best means to speak
 log ise apana rahe hai
 Although it is also misused, but it is happening not only in India but in the whole world

 unhone kaha ki kuch logon ne maahaul kharaab karne kii koshish kii, ashishnutaa kaa mudda uthaaya gaya, kuch log aword waapas kar sarkaar kii chhavi dhoomil karne main lage the, lekin ek bada varg sarkaar ke saath he
 The Minister of State for Information said that where the secret is to be kept
 modi sarkaar rakhti he, na to paisa li hota he na jaankaree
 It is not like earlier governments that everything gets leaked before the meeting
 soshal media par trols or bhakt ke sawaal par rathod ne kaha ki agar soshal media par hona bhakt hona he, to jaldi se bhakt banie
 
 
 Join social media
 unhone kaha ki jab yaman or iraq main bhartiya fanse hue the, to bharat sarkaar ne unako nikaalane ke liye har kadam uthaaya
 It is not just about one person
 ye sarkaar bharat ke har naagarik ke liye ladegi
 On the question of Pakistan policy, he said that the Government of India's stand is very clear
 aatank or baatcheet saath nahin chal sakati
 The policy of this government is clear that if it happens, terror will be first
 champions trophy main bharat-pakistan ke match par unhone kaha ki bhartiya cricket control board sarkaar kaa ang nahin he
 The Modi government is not feeding biryani to anyone
 aaj jitna sena ke paas hausala he, utana kabhi nahin tha

 But our president is embarking on a long journey in this scorching summer

 Government plans will be taken among the public
 chaahe wo andaman ho yaa kahin bhi
 
 logon ko sarkaar kii yojanaon ke bare main bataanaa bahut jaruri he
 It tells us what our fitness is
 ek samay tha ki garmiyon ke din main puri kii puri upie sarkaar chhuttiyon par hoti thi
 On the question of spreading the business and the business of promotion, he said that if we are making a mistake, then the opposition should bring it to Parliament
 tathy ye he ki ve sansad ko chalane nahin de rahe hai
 The Congress party has lied to Jawaharlal Nehru's alleged letter written to British PM Clement Attlee about Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose

 Take whatever action you feel is right on it
 ' haalanki chitthee par nehru kaa sirf naam likhaa he, unka hastakshar nahin he
 The letter was written on 27 December 1945

 It was from this platform that the top leader of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) Ashok Sinhal commented, in which there was pain of the past and hope of the future
 unhone kaha tha, ''bijepi ne 1990-91 vaali vaicharik raah chhod di thi, agar party waapas usee raah par dridhtaa ke saath khadi hokar chale to vah loksabhaa main 300 siten jeet sakati he
 The BJP and the Sangh Parivar bet on Narendra Modi and created history, regardless of coalition partners
 par sanyog hi he ki vihip apane astitv ke 50wein varsh main duvidha main he
 She is unable to decide whether the government of her dreams will implement her agenda
 yah duvidha beja nahin he
 Last year, the vhp's religion parliament in Kumbh was the first campaign to make Narendra Modi the prime ministerial candidate of the BJP, although Modi was not present in it
 loksabhaa chunaav main bhale hi 'apratyaashit sampradayik dhruvikaran dekha gaya, lekin ise modi or 'vikaas’ kaa samarthan mana gaya
 The results of the recent by-election, as if confirmed again
 or ab 50veen varshganth ke avasar par 'hindu hriday samraat’ modi kii ore se kisi tarah kaa shubhakamana sandesh na milanaa, na hi uske netaaon ke saath mulaakaat is baat kii ore ishaara kar rahi he ki modi ke netritvvali endie sarkaar vihip ke liye bahut saajagaar nahin hone vaali
 As it is, the VHP movements have gained an edge in the non-bjp regime itself
 lekin usne nai sarkaar se ummid nahin chodi he, jaisaa ki uske antarrashtriya mahasachiv chanpat raay india today se kehete hai, ''lambey samay baad desh main nae dhang kii sarkaar bani he, jiskaa pradhanmantri aazaadee ke baad paidaa hua shaks he or uski soch vahi he, jo ham chaahate hai
 "modi's support: Compulsion or strategy: The dilemma of VHP leaders is that they are avoiding talking to the Modi government on their issues right now
" unka kahana he ki is vakt sanghathan kaa focus sirf samaaj ko jaagruk bananaa he isliye ve apni urja ko baantnaa nahin chaahate
 According to sources, the Sangh Parivar is not in a mood to entangle the Modi government on any controversial issue for two years
 duusari taraf modi bhi vihip ko zyada tavajjo dene ke mood main nahin dikhte
 Even after four months of forming the government, he has not met any VHP leaders
 vihip ke ek varisht netaa kaa kahana he ki agar modi ne sangh ke netaaon se mulaakaat kii or vihip se nahin to yah dhyaan dena hoga ki sangh pitru sanghathan he jabaki vihip or bijepi kaa rishta bhai-bhai kaa he
 He reveals the Sangh's strategy, "the Sangh has clearly told all the advance organizations that the solution will be within the frame (within the existing constitutional scope), so there is no need to show aggression on the Ram temple issue
" ”vihip ke ek varisht modi samarthak netaa ke mutabik, vihip ko ehsaas he ki sansad ke ucch sadan (rajyasabha) kaa ankaganit modi sarkaar ke paksh main nahin he
 Therefore, there will be an effort to strengthen the BJP in the assembly elections for the next two years
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav prachaar ke samay jab modi ne devalayas se pehle shauchalay kii baat kahi thi, tab togdipha ne virodh karte hue unase maafee kii maang kii thi
 The picture of radical or soft Hindutva generational change in the BJP and the RSS has been completely clarified, but the war of supremacy in the VHP is so strong that if a camp always stands with Modi, the Togadia camp is considered to be a staunch opponent of Modi

 Prakash Sharma, a recent VHP national spokesperson and former Bajrang Dal convenor, who is considered a supporter of Modi, says, "there can be differences between individuals, but there is no distance from the VHP as an organization
 ” togdipha or modi ke katu rishte saarvajanik hai, aise main modi samarthak gut apana behatar bhavishya dekh rahaa he
 Along with Champat Rai and Togadia, the name of the organization General Secretary Dinesh Chandra is also taken as factions
 ek varisht netaa kii tippanee he, ''ashok sinhal ke baad vihip main jabardast varchasv kii ladaai sataha par dikhegi
 However, Togadia says on this question of India Today, "we do not answer questions related to political or individual
 in sawaalon kaa vihip se koi matlab nahin he
 "the VHP has always been adopting an aggressive strategy on issues like temple, cow protection, conversion, while the fabric of Sangh cultural nationalism has been creating a definition of Hindutva
 aise main vihip agar naram hindutv kii raah apanaati he to uske astitv par sawalia nishaan lag jayega
 This is the reason why VHP has adopted the strategy of Hindu Sammelan at 700 places in the country in the 50th year to show its importance
 is aayojan ko sirf chuttee ke din (shanivaar-ravivaar) ko karne kii yojana he, jisamen har saptaah 40-50 jagahon par sammelan honge or uske kendriya padaadhikariyon kii puri team in sabhi sammelnon main shirkat karegi
 In November, Ram is taking out a Baaraat Yatra which will go through azamgarh-ghazipur in UP to Janakpur in Nepal
 is yatra ko lekar pichley saal 84 kosi parikrama kii tarah hi tanaav kii ashankaayen jataai ja rahi hai
 The experience of its governments, however, completely derailed the movement in 1993
 isaki vajah yah thi ki bijepi ke kuch netaa babari dhaancha giraae jane se pehle 1991 main rajasthan, madhya pradesh or uttar pradesh main apni sarkaar banane se ati aatmavishvaas main aa gaye the
 The BJP was overlooked here because the saints did not campaign in the 1993 election and they also lost in a wave that destroyed the dome of the Babri Masjid after the car service
 uske baad centre main endie kii sarkaar bani to vihip ko gaiyr bijepi sarkaron ke mukaable zyada apmaan sahanaa padaa
 The agitation against the Tehri dam was the most hurt to his credibility
 us samay sinhal or giriraaj kishor sareekhe netaaon ne jal samadhi tak kii dhamkee de di thi, lekin unhen baad main peeche hatana padaa
 Under the pressure of Sinhala, the Vajpayee government formed a committee under the chairmanship of Murali Manohar Joshi, who flagged off the Tehri dam, and the water released through the pipes was accepted by the VHP as the uninterrupted Ganga
 nai urja hasil karne kii jaddojahadamodi sarkaar ke do maheene puure hone ke baad sinhal ne jab 2014 ke aam chunaav kaa is tarah vishleshan kiya, ''bharat main jinako secularavaadi bolte hai, ve musalamaanon ko hindu samaaj ke viruddh khadaa kar raajnneeti chalaanaa chaahate the
 But Muslims have understood for the first time that a government can be formed in the country even without their power
 ” yah bayaan vihip kii yah soch jaahir karata he ki aakraamakata ke bina uske sanghathan ko dhar nahin mil sakati
 Therefore, she wants to take advantage of having her own ideological government
 lekin vah jis tarah modi sarkaar kaa phayda uthaa rahi he usase sampradayik tanaav kaa maahaul paidaa ho jaataa he
 However, Modi is committed to providing a better life by providing employment opportunities to crores of unemployed
 yani vihip or modi kaa agenda mail nahin khaataa
 In such a situation, where he is in dilemma due to his government, the Modi government has to follow the national religion
 lekin jab bhi aisa lage ki modi vihip ke agenda ko lagu karne lage hai to maan lijie ki halaat unke kaabo se baahar ho rahe hai

 video recording isse aap 460 frem prati second ke dar se kar sakate hai or yah 4K recording ke bhi qaabil he
 For the selfie, it has a 16-megapixel front camera
 donon camera sensors soni ke hai
 In the camera interface, you have been given advanced HDR feature
 camera interphes aasaan he or isse shandaar or profeshnal tasviren clic kii ja sakati hai
 However, the lack of a telephoto of one of its dual rear cameras can be called a drawback
 lekin becoground bler karne ke liye yah thik he
 Good photography can be done under low light or good lighting conditions at all times
 aapako advanced photography kerani he to iske liye isamen pro mod diya gaya he
 From here you can give a professional touch to photography by using features like ISO and White Balance
 auto mod par bhi acchhee photography hoti he
 Super slow motion is an amazing feature and it is very useful
 camera ap main aap chote video edit bhi kar sakate hai
 Tasks can be performed to add music to it or to apply pir filters
 kai filters die gaye hai jinhen yuj kiya ja saktaa he
 The camera focus of oneplus 6 is superb and it focuses any object quickly
 khaas baat ye he ki object dur ho yaa paas aapako clic kii gai tasviir dekhne main acchhee lagati he or colors achche lagate hai real lagate hai
 In the case of low light, you will get noise in pictures and if you compare it with Pixel 2 and Galaxy S9, then in this case its camera is behind them both
 photography karnaa is smartphone se kaaphi aasaan he, kyonki yujar interphes kaaphi simple he
 Overall, its camera is excellent, but it definitely felt a little faded compared to Galaxy S9 Plus and Pixel 2 XL
 bydaree bavepabooneflus 6 main 3300mah kii bydaree di gai he
 The backup is good and you can use it comfortably one day by full charge
 qolkom snapadragon 845 bydaree iffishient procesar he or isamen kuch bydaree seaving fitures bhi hai jo bakhubi kaam karte hai
 If you watch heavy gaming, messenger, social media and videos more then you will need a charger in half a day
 lekin ab jo isaki khaasiyat he wo iskaa dasha charger
 It is very fast and your phone charges fast
 sirf 38 minute main hamane dasha charger se ise 60 fisadi tak charge kiya he
 During the launch, the company had claimed that you can do gaming while charging the phone with the dash charger or watch videos
 hamane rivyuu ke dauraan ise daawey par khara paaya he
 Since the charging process takes place in the dash charger adapter, the phone does not heat up and this is a good thing
 yani dasha charger ke do bade phaayde hai
 Should you buy this smartphone? If your budget allows you should buy this smartphone
 is segment kaa best smartphone bhi he or aapako yah rivyuu se andaja ho jayega aisa ham kyon kah rahe hai
 However, if it had a rating of wireless charging, new design and water resistance, it could not only beat this segment, but could also beat the expensive segment
 lekin aisa nahin he
 Rating to date - 8

 The incident in Kasganj, which shook the country, has already taken a week
 dhire-dhire kasganj shahar apni puraani raftaar par laut aayaa he
 The opening of shops is a stroll in the markets
 subah bacchon se bhare rickshaw skulon kii ore jate dekhe ja sakate hai
 Students attending colleges are appealing for peace in the city
 kasganj kaa har bashinda yahi dua kar rahaa he ki is shahar ko phir kisi kii buree najar naa lage
 Aman has undoubtedly returned to the city but the administration is fully prepared
 adhikari field main date rah kar har sthiti par najar rakhe hue hai
 Rapid Action Force contingents are still carrying out flag marches in every corner of the city
 prashasan kii koshish yahi he ki kisi bhi updravi tatv ko shahar main phir koi khuraafaat karne kaa mauka naa mili
 In 'aaj Tak' Nekasganj went from place to place and tried to get people to know their heart
 jaananaa chaha ki kasganj kya phir se amir khusro or tulsidas kaa kasganj ban paaegaa? kya yahaan se ganga jamuni tahjeeb kaa sandesh desh ko phir ja paaegaa?‘aaj tak’ samvaadadaata ne kasganj main un teenon jagahon kaa gauge liya jahaan ganatantr diwas vaale din shuru hui ghatana hinsak takaraav main badal gai or goli lagane se chandan gupta kii jaan chali gai, saath hi naushaad pair main goli lagane se ghayal hua
 One week after the incident 'aaj Tak' first moved to Baradwari area
 yaheen se 26 janvari ko chandan gupta or uske saathi vande maataram or bharat mata kii jai ke naare lagaate hue niklaa tha
 The people of Baradwari hope that the situation will be rectified soon
 is ilaake main dukaan chalaane vaale naval kehete hai ki halaat dhire dhire thik ho rahe hai or ummid he ki jald hi sab kuch pehle jaisaa ho jayega
 The second episode of the sad incident that took place in Kasganj on 26 January was the area of badunagar
 yaheen sthit vir abdul hamid chowk par kathith taur par bhadakaau naare lagane ke baad bavaal hua tha
 The police detained 6 boys after a raid in Badunagar last week
 ghatana ke ek hafte baad ‘aaj tak’ vir abdul hamid chowk par pahunchaa to vahaan galiyon ke muhane par sangeenon ke saath pulicekarmi paharaa dete dikhe
 Shopkeepers were engaged in business as usual, so children were seen coming alone on the road
 badunagar main logon kaa yahi kahana tha ki halaat ab thik ho gaye he or aman-sukun laut aayaa he
 a large number of people of the Muslim community live in Badunagar
 26 janvari kii ghatana ko lekar aise aarope bhi saamne aae the ki yahaan pakistan ke samarthan main naare lage
 Aaj Tak spoke to the people of the Muslim community standing at Veer Abdul Hameed Chowk on such allegations
 jo kuch unhone kaha, unamem ye baaten ahm hai
 1
 “agar hindu or musalmaan donon chaahe to aapas kii kadavaahat khatm ho jaaegi
 "2
 “ham pahal karnaa chaahate hai
 If the Hindu brothers want to take out the tricolor on August 15, we are with them
 ham chaahate hai ki ve muslimon ko bhi apane saath lekar chale
 If we raise slogans of 'pakistan Murdabad', we will do so before and beyond them
 ‘pakistan murdaabaad’ tha he or hameshaa rahegaa
 "3
 “muslim sirf allaah ke saamne sir jhukaate hai
 Vande Mataram means to bow before the earth, so we cannot bow before the earth
 lekin ham ‘hindustan jindabad’ kehete hai or ‘jai hind’ bhi kehete hai
 We also sing- 'our best from all over India
 ’ ye baat ham pakistan kii chaati par chadhakar bolenge
 Also, a thousand times will speak - Pakistan Murdabad
 ”4
 "we have nothing to do with Pakistan
 ham bharat main paidaa hue yahi paley bade, azaadi kii ladaai main hindu, muslim, sikh, isai sabhi saath milakar lade or angrejon ko yahaan se bhagaaya
 India is a country of all of us
 "5
 There were no slogans in support of Pakistan here
 agar ham par koi aisa aarope laga rahaa he to wo bilkul galat he
 Everybody from Badunagar wants to join the army and tell how much he loves India
 badunagar main jinase baat kii gai unhone ye sawaal bhi uthaaya ki yahaan adhiktar garib majdoor, palledaar rahete hai
 They are worried about raising bread every day on June 2, what riot they will create
 badunagar ke baad ‘aaj tak’ ghatana kii teesri kadi vaali jagah soot mandi pahunchaa
 According to the statement of DM Singh of Kasganj, the angry youth, who stopped the tricolor journey, arrived here with flags and poles in the hands of revenge
 chandan gupta kii hatya main namjad aropiyon- saleem, wasim or naseem kaa ghar soot mandi ke paas hi sthit he
 Of these, Salim has been arrested
 kasganj ke dm ke mutabik chandan gupta ko goli chat par se maari gai thi
 The story looks similar in the CCTV footage that surfaced
 jahaan se ghatana kii teesri kadi kaa video banaaya gaya, ‘aaj tak’ vahaan bhi pahunchaa
 The video was shot from the roof of this building located near the Sut Mandi Collectorate
 baharhaal, soot mandi main bhi ab halaat puri tarah saamaanya dikhaai die
 In Kasganj, what Hindus, Muslims do, everyone wants that peace and tranquility always prevail in the city
 saath hi raajnneeti kaa wo jehar yahaan se dur hi rahe jo apane phaayde ke liye insaan ko insaan se baantnaa chahta he
 There is a severe shortage of water in areas of Saurashtra and North Gujarat
 saurashtra ke rajkot, jamnagar or amarelli zilon ke kai gaanvon main alag-alag jagahon par 7 din se lekar 18 din ke antaraal par pani aata he
 When we met the people of Lodhika village of Rajkot, it came to know that there was no water in the village for 12 days and there is no possibility of water for the next 4-5 days
 gaanv ke log har 3 se 4 din ke antaraal par nahaate hai or itane hi dinon par kapade bhi dhoe jate hai
 Without drinking water, the water tank is called from the market at an interval of every 4-5 days, which solves the problem of drinking water for 4-5 days
 lekin is ek tank ke liye unhen 150 rupee dene padate hai
 In the village, small children do not appear to go to school, instead they will be seen carrying water from the pot
 gujarat ke saurashtra main kai dam sookhne kii kagaar par hai, isliye sarkaar unase logon ko pani nahin de paa rahi he
 Although water is being transported through canals of Narmada canal to Saurashtra, but it seems inadequate
 log sarkaar se guhaar lagaate rahete hai, lekin koi khaas karrwai nahin ho rahi he
 The sarpanch of Kotda Sangani village in Rajkot told that his village used to get water every 10 days for the last two months
 unhone andolan kiya to ab 5-6 din par pani aane laga he, jisase kuch had tak unki samasya hal hui he
 The comments is bich khabar ai he ki arab sagar main chakravaat uth rahaa he, jisase saurashtra samet gujarat ke kai ilaakon main agle do dinon main barsaat kii sambhaavna he
 People feel that the government is not listening, maybe if the weather is kind and if it is good rain, then their problems will get easier
 varanaa lodhika gaanv ke log to kah rahe hai ki agar pani kii samasya hal nahin hui, to yaa to wo vahaan se palaayan kar duusari kisi jagah rahane chale jaaenge yaa phir aanevaale samay main sabhi chunaavon kaa bahishkaar karenge

 Both of them became friends on Facebook
 tasveeron main dekhen kaise hisar ke gaanv main jindagi basar kar rahi hai adrianabharat aane ke do maheene baad adriana ne apane 25 varshiya premi mukesh kumaar se byaah rachaa liya
 Not only did Adriana marry, but she is completely settled in Mukesh's family
 haryana ke panipat ke chote se gaanv main adrean bilkul usee tarah se rah rahi hai jaise baaki ke gaanv vaale rahete hai
 Partying with her friends in California, shopping with her daughter Lucy and going to the gym, Adriana now sweeps her in-laws, cooks and also works in the fields
 jindagi main aae is bade badlaav se adriana behad khush hai
 Adriana, who works as a receptionist at an acupuncture center in California, says, "I feel very good here with Mukesh
" main iske badale duniya kii koi bhi cheez qurbaan kar sakati hum'
 Adriana says that she has had many affairs in America, but she never got true love
 unhone pichley saal farvari main apane se 16 saal chote mukesh se fasebuk ke jariye baatcheet kerani shuru kii
 Gradually the two came close to each other and one evening Mukesh got a call
 adriana kahati hai, 'phone par hi mukesh ne apane pyaar kaa izhaar kiya
 i did not know how to react and at first i just laughed
 lekin jab hamane thodi or baat kii to mujhe ehsaas hua ki vah rishte ko lekar gambhir he
 i told him that if he wins my heart then i will marry him
 iske baad hamane teen or hafton tak baatcheet kii or usee dauraan maine tay kar liya ki mujhe mukesh ke saath rahanaa or main bharat jane ke liye taiyaar hum'
 Adriana had to leave her 25-year-old daughter Lucy in the US to meet Mukesh
 adriana ke mutabik, 'jab maine logon ko bataaya ki main bharat ja rahi hum to ve hairaan rah gaye
 My daughter was crying
 use chintaa sata rahi thi ki kahin mere saath kuch galat naa ho jaae
 He said that India is not safe for women and then i had to explain it
 'kuch log kehete the ki mukesh farji he or vah vaaki main he hi nahin
 i cannot tell how i felt when i first saw him outside the Indira Gandhi Airport in Delhi
 adriana ke liye bharat ke chote se gaanv main rahan aasaan nahin tha
 There is neither toilet nor other basic facilities inside the house
 unhone kaha, 'jab main pehali baar ghar ke andar daakhil hui to hairaan rah gai
 There is more ban on girls
 mahilaon ko apane tan ko acchhee tarah dhak kar rakhana hota he
 We cook on the stove
 ham bail gaadi kaa istemaal karte hai
 If my family comes to know how i am living then they will understand that i have gone mad
 shuruyaat main to bahut dikkat ai, lekin mujhe jald hi ehsaas ho gaya ki khush rahane ke liye fancy toilet yaa shower kii jarurat nahin'
 Adriana says that the villagers have accepted her wholeheartedly
 unke mutabik, 'pehle to ve mujhe kisi celibrity se kam nahin samajhate the, lekin ab apane jaisaa hi maanate hai
 Now i dress up like her and speak a little Hindi too '
 mukesh or adriana kii shaadi november 2013 main puure hindu reeti-rivaajon ke saath hui
 Mukesh speaks broken English and says 'adriana is a good wife'
 wo hameshaa ghar ke kaamon main lagi rahati hai or jab meri maa bartan dhoti he wo kahati hai, 'nahin main karuungi
 This is my job '
 main adriana ke saath ghar basaakar behad khush hum
 it's true love'
 ab donon apana parivaar badhanaa chaahate hai
 However, Adriana does not rule out going back to America
 unka kahana he, 'main mukesh ke saath apana parivaar badhanaa chaahati hum or meri saas to chaahati hai ki hamaare do bachche hon
 i want to bring some American food and amenities here
 lekin ek din ham apane parivaar ke saath america waapas janaa chahenge

 choudhary ne bataaya, "paanch bachche ek ghar main funs gaye the
 
 
 We rescued them around midnight
 
 
 " ek tasviir main paanchon bacchon ke siron, chehron or seenon par safed raakh kii parat ko dekha ja saktaa he
 Singrauli, part of which falls in Uttar Pradesh's Sonbhadra district, has 10 coal-fired power plants, with a total capacity of 21,000 MW in any region of the country
 kendriya pradooshan niyantran board (CPCB) ke mutabik, inhen power planton ne singrauli ko ghaziabad ke baad desh kaa doosraa sabase zyaada pradooshit audyogic kshetra bana diya he
 The EPMPL said in a statement that the breaking of the ash pond is a Wednesday night incident, and alleged that it was a 'clearly deliberate incident' (sabotage or Sabotage)
 shri choudhary ne bataaya, "raakh ke li hone se lagbhag 500 kisaan prabhavit hue hai
 
 
 We have called for a preliminary inquiry, which will examine all aspects, including a statement issued by the company
 
 
 " colector ne yah bhi bataaya ki rajya tathaa kendriya pradooshan niyantran adhikari sample ikatthe kar rahe hai
 Villagers can see the flood of silt in the areas around the power plant, including agricultural land, in photographs and videos made by the villagers
 is kritrim talaba kaa istemaal us raakh ko jamaa karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, jo koyala aadhaarit power plant main mul utpaada ke saath-saath paidaa ho jaati he
 This coal ash is very harmful, which contains many poisonous substances including arsenic

 " Film Review: The Lunch boxector: Irrfan, Nimrat Kaur, Nawazuddin siddiquidirector and Writer: Ritesh Batraduration: 1 hour 44 minutes How is the movie The Lunch Box? Everyone has been asking this question since i came to see it
 jawaab bahut sidhaa sa he
 This is a very simple, simple film, represented in many layers
 trailor dekhakar lagata he ki lav story he da lunch box
 But it is a story of going beyond that and understanding ourselves anew, clearing the nets in the darkness of the past, and encouraging a new journey
 ye andar kii aawaaj se rabta kaayam karne or samaaj main sach si ho chuki khaufnak sochon kii papadi ukhaadne kii koshish bhi he
 If you are fond of watching good movies, watching movies with family, and if cinema means to you, then when you return from the hall, come back with a piece of the story on your mind's ground
 to lunch box aapke liye he
 There is an accountant in Mumbai
 dashakon se ek sarkari daftar main filon ke bich ghira kaam karata he
 His name is Fernandes (irrfan)
 uski jindagi ek lakeer ke baar baar khinche jane se bani basi kharonch si he
 Checking the data in the office
 lunch brake main restaraan kaa khaanaa khaanaa
 Smoking cigarettes before boarding a local after the holiday
 waapas jaakar hotel kaa pack khaanaa khaanaa or uske baad balakani main ek or cigarette pinaa
 Everything is fainting, but with a hollow silence
 phir ek roj uske paas jo lunch box aata he
 He belongs to someone else
 ye lunch box nahin he ek adrishy pul he
 This bridge cannot bear the weight of humans, but takes their thoughts from this corner to that well
 ek aankh he, jo chashma utaar lunch box main rakhe pakwaan soonghti he, sahalaati he, saraahti he or fidd khaati he
 There is a woman at the other end of the bridge
 ila (nimrat cor) naam he uskaa
 Ila has a child and a husband
 jo bas daftar se aata jaataa he or patni se ek mahanagareey kism kii thandak baratata he
 When Ilaham happens that the box reaches somewhere else
 to roti ke saath parchi jane lagati he
 When this process starts, it is met without meeting
 dukh, takalif, chintaaen or armaan ek duusare ke saamne bichne lagate hai
 And in the same sequence, Ila and Fernandes find themselves fresh, able to go beyond the fear
 is safar ke dauraan in do ke bich duniya he or us duniya kaa billaa pahan hajiri bharta he shaikh (navazuddin)
 Sheikh, it is all those things that make us
 akelaa hone kaa, jujhane kaa, pyaar paane kaa or choti choti duniyavi sajishein rachane kaa madda
 The beauty of the film is that in today's apnea and if we can say that the extent of vulgarity is not obvious like love
 yahaan kuch bhi turat phurat nahin he
 There is no forced restlessness
 ek tanaav sa he, jo is kahani ko dekhne vaale ko apana raajadaar bana letaa he
 You are watching this and both the characters are becoming the rulers in this sequence
 phir khud ko bataae bina aap apane dhang se in kirdaaron ko kuch bataanaa chaahate hai, dusron ke bare main
 Their stress also makes you feel appreciated
 ek kahani ke jinda hone kaa subut hota he ye anubhav
 The film does not have Irrfan
 ek shaks he shaleen dhang se chidhchidha yaa kahen ki rigerv ho chukaa
 Cursed to be middle aged
 uski kalmon ke kinaaron se plasters ukhdane laga he kaale rang kaa
 And when there is no actor in the film
 bas kirdaar hi ho, to aap samaj lijie ki abhinay kitna tasallibaksh rahaa hoga
 Nimrat Kaur did not see that she was working in a film for the first time
 acting nahin kahuunga, ek kism kaa chhichhlaapan sa lagata he ila ke role main unhen dekhne ke baad is kriya ke istemaal main
 Confined in itself by taking many turns
 kuch jhijakati, besabab yakeen karti or phir us des ke safar ko nikalati ila, jahaan paise nahin khushi or apana saath myne rakhata he
 Nawazuddin has a small role, but his clothes are so fine and clear that you start to see yourself in the sheikh
 itane akele ki anaath sa mahasoos karte
 Strong enough that everyone would have the courage to do it
 auki phir scooter jaisi chijen paane ke liye ek lajjat bhari sajeesh rachate
 The film does not end
 aap baahar aate hai or ye aapke saath chali aati he
 You keep changing its climax in its own way
 gadhate rahete hai ek nai kahani ki ab ila or furnandis ke saath kya hoga
 And during this, another voice comes
 antee kii aawaaj (bharti acharekar kii aawaaj)
 She is a companion of Auntie Ila
 yaa kahuun ki unki aawaaj
 Here, another experience of the fine Meenakari of director and writer Ritesh Batra is achieved
 kya khub film banaai he tumne yaar
 Gave surety a new height
 yakin ki cinema aisi saral or isiilie jatil kahaniyon ko bhi kehane kii gunjaaish rakhata he bharat main
 Now see
 beton ko mare jate is desh ko
 Where Ila's mother (lilit Dubey) does not have the pleasure that the married daughter is helping them
 ye dukh he ki agar uskaa betaa jinda hota, to aaj yun haath na failaane padate
 The mother says this and again takes the money from the daughter, filled with impatience and annoyance
 maa ye kahati he or usee dauraan ila kii beti par haath bhi pher rahi hoti he
 There are many such symbols in The Lunch Box
 papadiyaan ukhaadte, bina aawaaj kiye
 Some noise is lukewarm
 muskuraane ko majaboor karte
 Do check out The Lunch Box man bharpayt trupt hoga is box ko kholane or khaane ke baad
 Trailer of the movie The Lunch Box kamartod mahangaai se jujh rahi public ko thodi raahat milti najar aa rahi he

 After the cash crunch in many states of the country, the demonetisation-like atmosphere has been created, now the government and the Reserve Bank have stepped up efforts to get people out of trouble

 On the domestic front, Pakistan has been trying to normalize relations with the US, including the 2011 US military attack to kill Osama bin Laden and the death of 24 Pakistani soldiers in a NATO air strike from across the border last year
 The reason was sour

 The result was seen at the end of the year, when the US 68 as a compensation for Pakistan's expenditure in the war against terrorism

 bjp's new poster boy Narendra Modi will contest the Lok Sabha elections from UP
 iske kayaas to kuch maheenon se lagaae ja rahe the, magar unke khaas sipahasaalar amit shah ko upi kaa prabharee banaae jane ke baad yah lagbhag tay ho gaya tha
 Then the struggle started, to identify the seat on which the wind swept across UP in favor of the saffron party
 party sutron ke mutabik lakhanu, banaras or elahabaad aisi siten hai, jinhen modi ke liye pehle charan main short list kiya gaya
 Lucknow pan has the highest weight in this
 isaki tasdik hui buudhvaar ko, jab amit shah bataur party mahasachiv or pradesh prabharee pehali baar lakhanu pahunche
 Modi's fragrance turned into a chorus
 ab bachaa he to sirf aupchaarik elaan
 Amit Shah only said that 'the strong foundation of the NDA government that will be formed under the BJP leadership in 2014 will be laid from UP'
 party ranneetikaron ke mutabik ye sirf or sirf tabhi mumkin he, jab khud narendra modi yahaan se chunaav laden
 At present, BJP has only 10 seats out of 80 in Uttar Pradesh
 party ke aantarik survey ke mutabik agar modi upi se chunaav ladate hai, to ye aankada shartiya taur par 30 ke paar pahunch saktaa he
 Party president Rajnath Singh himself also wants Modi to contest from UP
 sutron ke mutabik rajnath is iljaam se tang aa gaye hai ki ve jis soobe se aate hai, vahiin unki party tiddi phiseddi ban gai he
 According to Shah's close aides, Modi will contest from Lucknow itself
 vajah sirf tay jeet nahin he
 Actually, this seat also has symbolic significance in the party
 yah seat 1991 se atal bihari vaajapeyi ko sansad pahunchaa rahi thi
 In 2009, when Vajpayee was not in a position to contest elections due to poor health, the party heavyweight and Atal's special Lalji Tandon contested from here
 prachaar ke dauraan tandon ne baar baar kaha ki main to sirf atal ji kii khadaauun sambhaal rahaa hum
 In such a situation, when Modi is claiming to hold the legacy of Atal at the Center, then what better seat than Lucknow can be used to strengthen it
 vaajapeyi se pehle bhi yah seat viipi rahi he
 Sheila Kaul, Indira Gandhi's maternal uncle and cabinet minister at the center, has also been elected three times from here
 immergency ke baad hue 1977 ke chunaav main yahaan se piem pad ke tagade daavedaar hemavathi nandan bahuguna bhi chunaav jeet sansad pahunche hai
 Talking about the current situation, the BJP cannot breathe very comfortably
 2012 ke pehle tak haal ye tha ki shahar kii paanchon siton par bijepi kamobesh jhaadu laga detii thi
 But in the last election, only one seat came from Kamal
