 devda kaa yah bayaan us samay aayaa, jis samay dilli main isi vishay par sarvadaleey baithak ho rahi thi
 Deora said that i believe that good governance, constantly in electoral mode, is a hindrance in raising real problems and the governance character of populist promises is definitely not a long-term solution to the serious problems facing the citizens of the country

 box offis par lagaataar hangaamaa machaa rahi film 'bahubali 2' kii 1500 karod paar kii kamai ko 'gadar' ke diarector anil sharma koi itihaas rachana nahin maanate
 Anil Sharma says that today, according to statistics, his film Gadar crossed the 5000 crore mark
 box offis par kamai ke roj nae record tod rahi film bahubali ke bare main anil sharma kaa kahana he ki ye sab samay-samay kii baat he
 His film 'gadar Ek Prem Katha' came in the year 2001 and at that time the film grossed 265 crores
 agar aaj ke hisaab se dekhen to ye aankada 5000 karod hota he
 In such a situation, 'bahubali 2' has not made any record
 phir chalegaa bahubali or devsena kii jodi kaa jaadu, is film main aaenge najainil sharma ne bete utkarsh kii debyue film 'jeniyas' kii lonching ke maukey par is baad kaa khulaasa kiya
 When he was asked questions about the earnings of 'bahubali 2', he said, "don't bring me into all this
" agar koi acchhee film aegi to record tootenge hi
 As far as Bahubali 2 is concerned, this film has not done anything like this
 unhone aage kaha ki jaisaa ki maine pehle bataaya ki 2001 main gadar ne 265 karod kamaaye the, us samay tikat sirf 25 rupee kaa hua karata tha
 If we compare it with today's time, then it is 5000 crores and Bahubali 2 has earned only 1500 crores
 sabase kamau film bani bahubali-2, jaane karan johar ko hua kitna munafnil sharma ke bete utkarsh ne 'gadar' sani or amisha ke bachche kaa role play kiya tha
 Now he is going to debut in the film 'genius'
 is maukey par dharmend, hema malini or javed akhtar bhi maujuud the
 But even if Gadar did not break any record, if the argument is seen in Anil Sharma's talk, then the claim of making Gadar's record is also not correct
 kyonki is aadhaar par sholay or dilavaale dulahaniya le jaaenge kii kamai gadar se kahin zyada hoti! Former England captain Tony Greig termed the decision to rest Sachin Tendulkar and Mike Hussey 'embarrassing' during the tri-odi cricket series between India and Australia

 unmukt chand ke ajey 111 ranon kii pari se pehle under 19 vishwa cap cricket ke final match main aaj tak sirf do shatak lage the
 According to Wasim Akram, Unmukt's century was his best century in junior cricket till date
 isse pehle shatak lagane vaale brett williams (australia) or stephen peters (england) kaa naam koi ausat cricket premi nahin jaanata
 Now 34 years old, Peters scored more than 12,000 runs in first-class cricket, but could never win England, while Williams played only four first-class cricket matches before leaving cricket
 chaar saal pehle under-19 main malaysia main bharat kii jeet ke baad team ke captain rahe viraat kohli ne kaha tha, “maine sabase kaha tha ki vahaan jaakar aise khelnaa, jaise yah hamaari jindagi kaa aakhri khel ho
 "today Kohli is shining like a star on the cricket sky with 13 ODI centuries in 87 innings
 janvari main australia ke khilaaf unhone apana pehla test shatak adelaide main lagaaya tha
 It is a different matter that the day of Kuala Lumpur can be the only memorable day for the rest of his teammates as there are dozens of players for whom junior cricket, apart from Kohli or Yuvraj Singh (man of the tournament of the winning Indian team in 2000) The World Cup final is the most important moment of his life
 masalan, 2000 main under-19 team kii ballebaaji ke kram main sheersh sthaan par the ravanit ricki, lekin aakhri baar unhone 2008 main ranjai khelaa tha
 In the same year, Shalabh Srivastava, who took 14 wickets, was banned for five years after being accused of fixing in a home match
 2008 ke vijetaon ko sammanit karne ke liye yojit ek kaarykram main rahul dravid ne bataaya tha ki junior se mukhya team main aana kitna kathin hota he, main aapako yaad dilaanaa chahta ki 2000 main under-19 vishwa cap jeetne vaali team kaa sirf ek sadsy (yuvaraj singh) aaj brisben main bhartiya team kaa hissaa he (jisane teen deshon kii sibi shrunkhlaa jiti)
 This is a matter of thinking for you
 main 1991 main under-19 ke liye khelaa tha or main apni team main iklauta vyakti tha, jo uske baad bhi aage badha or bharat ke liye match khele
 This is the beginning of a decisive phase in your life
 yahaan ke baad aap kya karte hai, vahi myne rakhega
 "today, when a lot of new faces are coming in Indian cricket, it is no wonder that there is so much enthusiasm among the heroes of the Under-19 World Cup
 lekin unmukt ko chhod den to baaki ko apane rajya kii ore se ranjai khilne kii bhi guarantee nahin he
 Even though they have made headlines with this victory, but the real game is ahead
 under-19 main viraat kohli ke do or saathi ravinder jadeja or saurabh tiwari ne bhi bharat ko jeet dilwaai thi
 However, neither of them has become a regular part of the Indian team
 ipiel main shatak lagane vaale pehle bhartiya manish pandey ko team main pahunchane ke liye ab bhi kaaphi lanbaa safar tay karnaa baaki he
 Unmukt Chand, who has made his habit of playing long innings according to the need of the team, has the mental strength and ability to make long jumps to get entry into the Indian team
 quarter final main pakistan ke khilaaf 3 wicket par 8 ran kii khatarnaak sthiti se team ko ubaarane vaale baba aparajit ne bhi apana loha manavaa liya he, jabaki harmit singh ne jabardast dabaav ke bich santulan or niyantran baratate hue team ko jeet kii dahalij tak pahunchane kaa dhairya pradashat kiya
 Sandeep Sharma, who hit the yorker and swung the ball like a wizard, and Kamal Passi, who showed skill from both bat and ball, also caught the attention of the people
 lekin jaisaa dravid ne kaha tha ki yahaan ke baad ve jo karenge, vah zyada myne rakhega or vahi tay karegaa ki ve agle kohli yaa yuvaraj honge yaa phir anjaan naamon kii bheed main gum ho jaaenge

 com / 7zzqi9vekm madhyapradesh ke vindhyas kshetra ko yun to pichhadaa ilaaka mana jaataa he, magar yah kshetra prakritik sampada se bharaa padaa he
 The natural shade here is pleasing
 barish ke mausam main umadte-ghumdatebadalkai baar pahaado se galabahiyaan karte najar aate hai, jo romanchit kar dete hai
 About 40 kilometers from the divisional headquarters Shahdol towards the tribal dominated village Bijapuri of Anuppur district, there are many places where two vehicles cannot pass simultaneously on the road originating between two mountains
 kuch pal ke liye to aise lagata he, jaise pahaad hi hamaare upar aa gaya ho!sankare or ghumaavdaar raste se guzarate hue aasmaan par mandaraate badal kai baar aise lagate hai, jaise pahaado se galabahiyaan kar rahe hon
 This view makes it very captivating and makes you stay for some time
 is tarah ke drishy aamtaur par pahari ilaakon main hi dekhne ko milte hai
 Local resident Santosh Kumar Dwivedi says that this area is natural and culturally rich, tribal areas are in abundance here, or say that there are few people in the rural areas other than tribals
 adivasee prakruti or samskruti se prem karte hai, jiske chalate jangal bache hai or unki saanskrithik viraasat barkaraar he
 This is the reason that the view of this area during the rainy season is amazing and enchanting
 hare bhare pahaado ke paas aate badal, dosti kaa ahsaas kara jate hai
 Tribal social activist engineer Vijay Cole says, this area can be developed as a tourist destination, but governments do not pay attention to it
 sarkaar pahal kare to ek taraf jahaan paryatak prakruti kaa anand le sakenge, vahiin yahaan kii samskruti ko bhi jaan paaenge
 The dance, songs, music here are pleasing, which can win over everyone
 yah vah kshetra he, jahaan bandhavgarh jaisaa rashtriya udyaan he or amarkanta jaisaa dharmik nagar
 Therefore, if the State Government and the Tourism Development Corporation are determined, this area can be developed as a tourism sector, but both the government and the corporation are not focused on this

 The story of a young woman from Jodhpur who refused to adopt her marriage in childhood will now be read in the CBSE book
 sibiesai ne us yuvati kii kahani ko isi satr se kaksha 11veen or 12veen main ‘human ritis and gender studies’ kii kitaab main jagah di he
 Human Rights and Gender Studies are being introduced as a new subject from this session
 20 saal pehle jodhpur jile ke luni gaanv kii lakshmi kii umr jab sirf 1 saal thi, tab uski shaadi satlana gaanv ke 3 saal ke rakesh ke saath kar di gai thi
 When Lakshmi was 16 years old, she came to know about this marriage
 tabhi se wo apane aap ko shaadishuda maanane se lagaataar inkaar karti rahi he
 During this time she also came to know about some bad things and habits of her in-laws and her husband Rakesh
 iske chalate lakshmi ne apane gaune kaa virodh karne kaa faisla kiya or uske is faisle main uske bhai hanuman ne bhi saath diya
 On the occasion of Akshaya Tritiya, Lakshmi was supposed to be a cowboy, after which she had to stay in her in-laws, but she made up her mind to oppose it
 isi dauraan lakshmi or uske bhai ne sarathi trust kii managing trustee or punarvaas manovaigyanik kirti bharti kaa ek sthaneey channel par bal vivaah ke khilaaf ek intervyuu dekha
 The siblings asked Kirti for help
 lakshmi ne bataaya ki wo bachapan main hui is shaadi se khush nahin thi or usne is bare main apane mata-pita ko bhi bataaya, lekin ve nahin maane
 He then sought assistance from Bharti
 bharti ne 'aaj tak' ke sahyogi akhbaar 'mail today' ko bataaya ki pehle to unka iraadaa kisi tarah se counselling karke yaa kanoonee tareeke se ‘gauna’ hone se rokna tha, lekin lakshmi ko dar tha ki kuch maheene baad uske sasurali phir gauna karne kii jid karenge or use hameshaa ke liye unke ghar janaa padegaa
 Seeing this fear of Lakshmi, Bharti thought of a permanent solution to her problem
 iske baad kanoonee rup se lakshmi ke pati rakesh kii rajamandi ke saath 24 april 2012 ko jodhpur main public notary kii maujuudagi main donon kii shaadi ko radd kiya gaya
 According to Bharti, this is the first case of cancellation of marriage in childhood
 haalanki shuru main rakesh is shaadi ko banaae rakhana chahta tha, lekin counselling ke baad vah naram pad gaya
 The story of Lakshmi has been included in the book 'gender Related Issues' as the second chapter
 is adhyay kaa naam ‘indian tinager anals har child marij’ diya gaya he, yah 11veen kaksha kii kitaab main pej number 207 par he
 However, it is not mentioned in this chapter that after growing up, Lakshmi married a man of her choice on 31 January 2013
 uske pati kaa naam mahendra he
 She is now happy and happily living with her husband in Rohat village in Pali district
 chargeshit main kathua sthit rasana gaanv main devisthan , mandir ke sevadaar ko apharan , balaatkaar or hatya ke peeche mukhya sajeeshkarta bataaya gaya he

 Film Name: Kaun Kisni Pani Director: Neela Madhab Pandstar Cast: Kunal Kapoor, Radhika Apte, Saurabh Shukla, Gulshan Grover Duration: 113 minutes Certificates: u / a Rating: 1
 5 stararahim ji kaa ek doha he, 'rahiman pani raakhiye, bin pani sab sun', yani pani kii maujuudagi bahut hi jaruri he
 In 2011, a film released 'ayam Kalam', which is widely appreciated, then 'jalpari' in 2012 and 'bablu Happy Hai' in 2014, which was not appreciated by the audience
 ab inhen filmon ke diarector nila maadhab pandas ne pani kii samasya par aadhaarit ek film banaai he jiskaa naam 'koun kitne pani main', ab kya yah film diarector kii soch ko janata tak pahunchaayegi? aaie jaanate hai kisi he yah film:kahaneeyah kahani he do gaanvon kii jinka jaat ke aadhaar par vibhaajan kiya gaya he, upree bhaag main pushtaini raja ke vanshaj vruj singh dev (saurabh shukla) apane logon ke saath rahete hai or bairi bhaag main khaaru pahalwaan (gulshan grover) apane logon or beti jahnavi (radhika apte) ke saath rahata he
 When Raj Singh Dev (kunal Kapoor), son of Vraj Singh Dev, comes to his village after writing studies, he sees that there is a problem of water on every side and together with his father, he pretends that Barry started getting water from the part
 aakhirkaar donon gaanvon ke log kisi ek nishkarsh par ekamat hote hai or happy anding ho jaati he
 The issue of script, acting, music and film is quite intense but the script and screenplay are quite faded
 jahaan ek taraf raja he lekin uske paas bhi pani nahin he, vahiin puri film main paise se badhkar pani ko dikhaaya gaya he, jaise pani dekar aap shaadi kijiye, pani dekar sahavaas kariye or pani dekar hi is gaanv main pujari aapako aashirwad detaa he
 Neela has made a very good blueprint for the film, but the manner of showing satire is quite weak
 film kaa ek dialaag kaaphi khaas tha kii 'pyaase kii koi jaat nahin hoti, pyaasa to bas pyaasa hota he
 'raja's property is not sold because there is no water in the village, Raja's son goes to work in the enemy village
 aaj kii ikkisvi sadi main is film ko dikhaane kaa dhang or bhi behatar ho saktaa tha kyonki pani kaa mudda bahut hi gambhir he or use vyangy ke rup main dikhaane kii koshish naakaam si lagati he
 If we talk about acting, then Saurabh Shukla, Gulshan Grover and Radhika Apte have done great work and maybe after many days, Kunal's acting edge has reduced due to appearing on the silver screen
 kunal ko dekhakar aap unke kirdaar se ittefaq nahin rakh pate hai
 Odisha's folk song 'rangbatti' is quite good in the film but there is also a love song which weakens the pace of the film
 kyon dekhenyadi aap kunal kapur, radhika apte, saurabh shukla yaa gulshan grover ke fain hai, tabhi is film ko dekhen
 Why not see Mehanat's earnings like water, don't look for any other option on weekends

 BJP president Amit Shah has appointed election in-charge and associate of Haryana, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Delhi
 isi ke saath bhaajapa ne in chaaron rajyon main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav kaa shankhanaad kar diya he
 At the same time, the BJP has devised a strategy to solve the caste-regional equation
 bhaajapa adhyaksh or kendriya grahamantri amit shah ne kendriya mantri prakaash jaavdekar ko dilli kaa chunaav prabharee banaaya he
 Whereas, Union Ministers Hardeep Singh Puri and Nityanand Rai have been given the responsibility of election cum in-charge

 Whatever decision will be taken in the meeting of this group of 14 countries, it will pave the way for cutting and increasing prices of petrol and diesel in the coming days
 shuukravaar ko ho rahi is baithak main ek ahm prastaav par charchaa honi he, jo agar paas ho gaya to aapako saste petrol or dijal kaa tohfa aage bhi miltaa rahegaa

 If this proposal is passed in the meeting, all OPEC countries will increase the production of crude oil
 isse kachche tel kii behatar aapurti ho sakegi
 The advantage of having a good supply will be the possibility of a cut in crude oil prices
 iskaa sidhaa phayda gharelu str par saste petrol or dijal ke taur par milegaa
 But Iran, which is implicated in Iran, has said that it will do whatever it can to pass this proposal to increase the production of crude oil

 If Iran's mind 
 
 agar baithak main iran ke man kii hoti he or production badhaane kaa prastaav paas nahin ho paata he, to kachche tel kii supplai par iskaa asar padana tay he
 This may increase the prices of crude oil
 aisa hone par petrol or dijal kii badhati keemton se raahat milane kii ummid kam ho jaaegi
 Will the meeting be inconclusive? In such a situation, what will the oil producer decide in the meeting of these 14 countries
 visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki yah baithak benatija sabit ho sakati he
 Because on one side the Saudi is adamant on its stand
 vahiin, iran bhi production na badhaane ko lekar apana paksh majboot kar rahaa he

 aaj 16 sitambar se poornima tithi ke din se shraadh kaa aarambh hoga gaya he
 In this ancestral period, charity is done in reverence to the ancestors in the form of tarpan
 pitrupaksh paksh ko mahalay yaa kanagat bhi kaha jaataa he
 According to the belief in Hinduism, when the Sun enters Kanyarashi, ancestors descend from the hereafter and come here on earth for some time to their sons and grandchildren
 shraadh sanskaramritak ke liye shraddha se kiya gayatarpan, pind or danhi shraadh kaha jaataa he or jis mrit vyakti ke ek varsh tak ke sabhi aurdhv daihik kriya-karm sampann ho jate hai, usee ko 'pitar' ko pitar kaha jaataa he
 It is written in the Vayu Purana that 'my ancestors who are beautiful, they should be satisfied with the sesame seeds of barley
 saath hi sristi main har vastu brahma se lekar tinke tak, chaahe vah char ho yaa achar ho, mere dwaara die jal se trupt hon'
 The reason for Shraddha According to ancient literature, ancestors come to the earth from the full moon of the month of Sawan
 vah nai ai kusha kii konpalon par virajman ho jate hai
 In Shraddha or Pitra Paksha, the person who takes donations and food in the name of ancestors or who removes it in their name, receives it in a subtle manner
 granthon main teen pidhiyon tak shraadh karne kaa vidhaan bataaya gaya he
 According to the Puranas, Yamaraja frees all the creatures in the Shraddha Paksha every year
 jisase vah apane swajanon ke paas jaakar tarpan grahan kar sakate hai
 The three ancestors father, grandfather and great-grandfather are considered as the three gods
 pita ko vasu ke samaan mana jaataa he
 The Rudra deity is considered like a grandfather
 aditya devtaa ko pardada ke samaan mana jaataa he
 It is considered representative of all other ancestors at the time of Shraddha
 shraadh kaa mahatvashraddha ke saath joshubh sankalp or tarpankia jaataa he use 'shraadh' kehete hai
 The importance of Shraddha is described in many ancient texts and Puranas
 shraadh kaa pitaron ke saath bahut hi ghanishtha sambandh he
 Shraddha is the only means of providing food and reverence to the fathers
 is prakaar kiya jaataa he ann daanshastron ke anusaar jin vyaktiyon kaa shraadh manaaya jaataa he, unke naam or gotra kaa uccharan karke mantron dwaara jo ann aadi unhen diya samarpit kiya jaataa he, vah unhen vibhinn rupon main praapt hota he
 For example, if a deceased person gets a deva vagina according to their deeds, then they get the food fed to the Brahmin on the day of Shraddha in the form of nectar
 yadi pitar gandharv lok main he to unhen bhojan kii prapti bhogy rup main hoti he
 If the animal is in the vagina, in the form of the trunk, the snake is in the vagina, in the form of air, in the form of Yaksha, in the form of drink, the demon is in the vagina, in the flesh, the phantom is in the vagina, and in the form of human vagina, the grain Food is obtained in the form of goa kii parafum visheshgy monica ghurde ke postmortem main yah baat saamne aayi he ki unki hatya galaa ghont kar kii gayi he, haalanki isaki pushti nahin ho saki he ki hatya se pehle uske saath balaatkaar hua tha yaa nahin

 By the way, it is only the nature of boys to get pranked on the ways of girls
 iske baavjood ladakon ko impress karnaa bahut zyada sahaj nahin hota he
 Girls must know how to treat a date with whom they want from Dilozan and with whom they want to take the relationship forward
 darasal, kisi shaks ke man ko padhanaa bahut mushkil kaam he
 If a boy gives more importance to a friend, it does not mean that he wants to be tied to him in a lasting relationship
 short time ke liye to ladke kisi ko bhi sweekaar kar sakate hai, lekin aage kisi mode par musiibat khadi ho sakati he
 This is the reason that in order to make a full impact on boys, it is important to take care of some things
 yahaan kuch tips die ja rahe hai:1
 Take special care of your dress before going on a date with the boy
 dress waisi honi chahie, jisamen aap puri tarah se shaleen najar aaen
 Understand this well that it is not necessary to have a brand new or expensive dress
 dress modern to chalegaa, par isse kisi tarah kii foohadataa nahin jhalkani chahie
 2
 jo bhi bolen, soch-samajhakar bolen
 As soon as you have thoughtfully, do not start saying it immediately
 kam shabdon main bhi apni baat zyada asardaar tareeke se kahi ja sakati he
 It should not be said that without saying anything without consideration, then it should be regretted after sitting for hours
 3
 Generally, boys feel that girls talk and talk too much
 ladakiyon ko chahie ki ve kam se kam shuruaati daur main is image par apni ore se 'muhar' lagaati najar na aaen
 Also, do not force the boy to annoy them by putting as many questions as possible
 4
 It is very pleasing to the boys to be blush with the girls, but balance is very important in this
 itnaa na sharamaaen ki koi jaruri baat ankahi rah jaae, par itnaa bhi na khul jaae ki aapaki image hi 'diferent' ban jaae
 5
 aap jaisi hai, ekadam waisi hi najar aane kii koshish karen
 Avoid wearing a cloak worn in the direction of putting impressions
 dur tak jane vaale rishte kii buniyaad sach kii jameen par hi tik sakati he
 6
 parafum ke zyada istemaal se bachein
 It is also best to use mild fragrance perfumes in very small quantities
 7
 Never try to see boys with glasses of money
 jajbaati ladke aisa katai pasand karte ki koi unke rishte ko dhan-daulat ke scale par maapen

 ghatnakram kii jaankaree rakhane vaale ek adhikari ne naam nahin chhapane kii shart par 'da express tribune' se kaha ki imran chaahate the ki unki trump se aamane-saamne kii mulaakaat ho jisase vah kshetra main pakistan kii bhoomika ko lekar america main paae jane vaale 'sanshay' ko dur kar saken
 But, due to tensions and lack of trust in the relationship between the two countries, it was a crooked task to persuade the US administration to meet
 aise main ek hi rasta samaj main aayaa or vah yah ki america prashasan ko bypass kar sidhe trump se sampark saadhaa jaae
 The official said, "this was the point when the use of non-traditional methods was considered
 " iske baad pakistan ne kushanar se nijee sambandh rakhane vaale prince salmaan kii madad lene ke liye unase sampark kaa faisla kiya
 After coming to power, there were many meetings between Imran and Salman, due to which the two developed a good relationship and it worked
 sutron ne bataaya ki iske baad prince salmaan ne kushanar ke jariye raashtrapati trump ko imran khan se mulaakaat ke liye sahamat kiya
 The newspaper reported that another person who played a major role in making Imran's visit to the US possible is Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who is considered close to the US and an admirer of Imran's 'vision' in the Afghanistan case

 ' If you get out of the discussions of some BJP leaders on land acquisition and roam in the surrounding rural areas, then you will be asking yourself the question whether the BJP tried to test its strength on the ground of rural politics before this law changes
 Was it? The surprise is further exacerbated when the captains and investors of private companies, along with the data, point out that the recession has now penetrated even in the rural and town markets where demand for consumer products, bikes, gensets, building materials is continuously falling
 jab tak shahari bazaar dulki chaal nahin dikhaate, gramin arthvyavastha ko jhatka dena thik nahin he
 However, the biggest surprise comes when the state officials say that after the new law, their governments had started persuading them to give land to the farmers at high compensation, but due to the central government's indiscriminate land, the land has started to become politically hot
 congress kaa bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon udyogon ke haq main nahin tha lekin vah ek lambii rajnatik sahmati se niklaa tha jisamen bijepi sahit sabhi dal shaamil the, jinaki sarkarein alag-alag rajyon main hai
 Land is ultimately a matter of the states, so the states had started the exercise of agreeing the farmers in their own way under the new law and replacing the concerns of the industries by changing the state law
 uttar pradesh sarkaar ne do saal main kareeb 30,000 hectare jameen kisaanon se lee
 This was not a one-time acquisition but the landlords spoke directly to each landlord and compensated them under the new law and made the land registry in the name of the government
 agar uttar pradesh sarkaar kaa aankada sahi he to aisi kareeb 28,000 registry ho chuki hai
 Estimates of socio-economic impact on the affected in large land acquisitions and the condition of consent of 80 per cent of landowners may be the reason for the delay in infrastructure projects
 rajasthan ne iskaa samaadhaan nikaalane ke liye rajya ke bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon main kisaanon ko muaavje kii raashi badhaane kaa prastaav diya
 Some suggestions were made by the State Assembly Select Committee, which made the law more or less balanced
 pashchim or dakshin ke rajyon ne land pooling ke jariye bhoomi adhigrahan ko sahaj kiya
 In this process, the government collects small parts of the land from the farmers and makes a big package and after developing the infrastructure there, the cost of development is removed from it and the land is given back to the landowners, which increases the price of the land and the vendors Private developers get good prices
 andhra pradesh sarkaar ne vijaywada ko apni nai rajdhani banane ke liye, land pooling ke jariye keval teen maah main 30,000 acre jameen kisaanon se juta lee he
 The government of Chhattisgarh successfully used land pooling to establish Naya Raipur just as it did in Gujarat
 jameen par raajnneeti kii aandhi shuru hone ke baad andhra pradesh ko ab vijag airport ke liye 15,000 acre jameen jutaney main mushkil hogi or rajdhani dilli main land pooling bhi sahaj nahin rahegi
 The ground is sensitive
 rajya sarkarein iske adhigrahan ko zyada vyaavhaarik taur par sambhaal sakati hai
 It would have been better if the states changed their laws according to the needs of the industry, as it did in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, or made efforts like land pooling which were done by the states of west and south
 lekin modi sarkaar ne ati aatmavishvaas main jameen kii jatil raajnneeti main khud ko ulajhaa liya or rajyon kii koshishon ko bhi kamjor kar diya he
 a vigilant government should have stayed on the agricultural land in view of the recent appearance of the rural economy
 nai sarkaar ne aate hi samarthan mulyon main badhotaree roak di
 It did not reduce inflation, but income from farming did decrease
 monsoon ausat se kharaab rahaa
 Prices of agricultural products decreased in the world, which also reduced exports
 gramin ilaakon main mazdooree badaae kii dar ab ghat gai he
 Meanwhile, in the light of growing concerns over farming, a political ground has been set aside to liberalize land acquisition, with a 26 percent increase in farmer suicides in 2014
 das saal main pehali baar gaanvon main jameen kii keemton main badhotaree ruk gai he
 The softening in gold prices is also due to reduced rural demand
 bharat main dupahiyaa vaahan, upabhokta utpaada, jensett, cement va bhawan nirmaan saamagree kaa bazaar bade paimaane par gramin arthvyavastha par nirbhar he
 The figures of companies of these products are showing a big decline in sales and earnings
 companiyon kii chintaa yah he ki shahari or audyogic arthvyavastha main growth kii roshni abhi tak nahin chamaki he
 After the acquisition of land, if the political atmosphere in the villages is disturbed then the right demand will be further replenished
 bhoomi adhigrahan par sir khapaane kaa yah sahi vakt nahin tha
 It would have been better to turn this way after returning to economic growth and employment, while the BJP leaders have been mulling that the party did not open its mouth on the land acquisition during the election and after coming to power, now they have to embrace this fireball from the farmers Is being given the responsibility of bhoomi adhigrahan ko lekar siyaasi va aarthik taapmaana parakhane ke baad yah dharna chot khaati he ki netaa hameshaa janata kii nabj sahi dhang se padhate hai
 It is not only that the haste of the ordinance on land acquisition has given the desperate and scattered opposition a chance to unite, but the impasse on this law is ending the feel-good in the country's environment
 bhoomi adhigrahan main badlaav jid ke saath sansad se paarit bhi ho jaae to bhi maahaul behatar nahin paaegaa
 During the discussion in the Lok Sabha on the President's address, the Prime Minister had taunted the Congress that i know politics well, but the changed politics on land acquisition is pointing to something else
 ek insaan ke jivan main shaayad sabase badi khushi pita banane kii hoti he
 But imagine that when you get this happiness, then you are not present there to witness it
 ji, kuch aisa hi hua he bhartiya olerounder rabindra jadeja ke saath
 Ravindra Jadeja became the father of a daughter late Wednesday night
 lekin vah champions trophy ke liye england main he isliye apni beti se nahin mil paae
 Seeing the daughter through video calling, Rarivaba, wife of Ravindra Jadeja, gave birth to the daughter late Wednesday night at Sterling Hospital in Rajkot
 rabindra jadeja or riwaba kii shaadi pichley varsh 17 april ko hui thi
 Ravindra Jadeja saw his little angel's face through video calling

 Dhoni's memory arrived
 
 You may remember, in 2015, when Jiva, the daughter of former Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, was born

 According to political experts, like Manipur, Goa and Meghalaya, if the Congress remains a few seats away from the majority, then the BJP will form the government in Karnataka
 isse pehle kai rajyon ke chunaav main bahumat ke aankade tak naa pahunch jane ke baavjood bijepi apni sarkaar banane main kaamyaab rahi

 loktantr kii kadra karne waalon ke liye or loktantr se takat paane waalon ke liye bhi isko yaad rakhana jaruri he
 The day of 25 June 1975, when the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi imposed emergency in the country citing internal disturbances
 iske saath hi jaiprakash narayan samet sabhi virdohi netaaon ko jail main daal diya gaya tha
 The term of Parliament was increased from five years to six years

 Along with all of this, the process of Indira's government and her petty prince and political heir Sanjay Gandhi's arbitrations began
 kaagaj par ise paanch sutri program kaha gaya
 Sanjay Gandhi was not at all impressed by his maternal grandfather Pandit Nehru's socialism and Mummy's alleged pro-poor policies

 For example, the book by Kuldip Nayar, then editor of the Indian Express news agency, Emergency Retold
 yaa phir itihaaskaaron ne ise bhartiya raajnneeti ke ek adhyay ke taur par likhaa
 For this, all the first hand accounts, news reports and the report of the Shah Commission made by the Janata government to investigate the emergency were considered as the basis

 kuch rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hone vaale hai jisamen maharashtra bhi shaamil he
 Now a lot of promises will be made before the election
 kisaanon kii samasya ko lekar baat hogi
 Many schemes for farmers will be announced
 chunaav ke baad yah sab vaade khokhale sabit honge kyonki agar rajnatik dalon ne apana vaada puraa kiya hota to aaj kisaan aatmahatya nahin karata
 Does not take loan from bank
 agar kisaanon ko apane fasal kaa sahi daam mila hota to dusron kaa pet bharne vaala kisaan khud bhookha nahin rahata
 a few days ago, 35-year-old Ujjwala of Vidarbha area of maharashtra committed suicide by jumping into a well with her four daughters but the news did not create as much uproar as it should have
 kareeb ek maheene pehle ujjwala ke pati ne bhi aatmahatya kar lee
 In the last four years, 5214 farmers have committed suicide in Vidarbha region
 ek kisaan ke aatmahatya kar lene ke baad uske parivaar ke bare main koi nahin sochataa
 In the hindu businessline, Radheshyam Jadhav has written a report saying that when the farmer commits suicide, there is nothing serious about his family
 yah bhi kaha gaya ki kai vidhwaa sarkaar kii skim se baahar ho jaati hai or pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke tahat unhen ghar bhi nahin milte
 Social workers are demanding Rs 1000 per month for the family of farmers in the form of widow pension but only 600 rupees is being given by the government and even this 600 rupees is not able to reach most widows
 june ke maheene main maharashtra sarkaar ne vidhansabha main kaha tha ki 2015 se lekar 2018 ke bich kul-milakar 12021 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 When the Congress and NCP were in Maharashtra between 2011 and 2014, 6268 farmers committed suicide
 2015 se 2018 ke bich yah sankhya 91 pratishat tak bad gai he
 Imagine if the Fadnavis government had promised the farmers in 2014 that the right way would have forced farmers to commit suicide? In the same month, 22-year-old Lovepreet Singh committed suicide due to debt in village Bhotana in Barnala district of Punjab
 Lee
 is kisaan parivaar kii chaar pidiyon ke 5 log karze ke kaaran aatmahatya kar chuke hai
 Due to the debt which 5 people of four generations of this family gave their lives, neither their debt could be forgiven nor the family could get any financial help
 karj 8 lakh rupye ke kareeb bataaya ja rahaa he jabaki parivaar ke paas kareeb ek acre jameen he
 Only the mother and sister of the deceased are left in the house now
 lovepreet ke pita ne kareeb 18 maheene pehle aatmahatya kar lee thi
 The Punjab government keeps talking about loan waiver but the condition of farmers in Punjab is not good
 indian express kii khabar ke anusaar pichley do saal main punjab main 1280 kisaan aatmahatya kar chuke hai
 a few days ago the Punjab and Haryana High Court said that farmers should get a fair price for crops
 court ne kaha tha kisaanon ko laagat se teen guna emspi milanaa chahie
 Now it is to be seen what steps the Punjab Government takes regarding this
 sabase dilachasp baat yah he 2016 ke baad desh main kul-milakar kitne kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he uskaa koi data centre sarkaar ke paas nahin he
 In 2018, while answering a question in the Lok Sabha, Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh said that the National Crime Records Bureau has not published any data on farmer suicides after 2016
 NCRB grih mantralay ke andar kaam karata he or krime ko lekar data sangrah karata he, jisamen aatmahatya bhi shaamil he
 According to data available on NCRB website, in 2015, 8000 farmers have committed suicide in the country and the highest number of 3030 farmers have committed suicide in Maharashtra
 report ke anusaar sabase zyada kisaanon ne rin or fasal kharaab ho jane kii vajah se aatmahatya kii he
 Altogether 5650 farmers committed suicide in 2014
 2016 ke baad kisaan aatmahatya kaa koi data hi nahin he
 Legislative assembly elections are going to be held in Haryana too
 mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ne kaha he ki haryana ke 10 lakh kisaan jinhone agricultural koaparative socity, district koaparative central bank se lone liya he or paisa waapas nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Or the farmers whose account has been converted into NPA will get rid of penalty and interest
 sawaal yah uthaa rahaa ki chunaav se pehle sarkaar ko kisaanon kii yaad kyon ai ?kisaan union kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ko puraa lone maaf kar dena chahie tha
 Had the farmer been in a position to repay the loan, the loan would have been repaid
 karj chukaa nahin paa rahe hai isiilie unka karj NPA ban gaya he
 Farmers Union says that farmers have taken loans from National Bank too, which is very much but the government is not forgiving it
 koaparative bank se kisaan adhiktam 90 hazaar kaa lone hi le sakate hai jabaki neshnal bank se 90 hazaar se zyada lone le sakate he
 That is why most of the farmers are worried about the loan taken from National Bank but the government is not serious about such farmers
 lagbhag sabhi rajyon main kisaanon kii halaat kharaab he
 The farmer is committing suicide
 sarkaar ko kisaanon kii samasya ko lekar zyada gambhir hona chahie
 The problems of the farmers are not solved just by announcing the scheme
 skim sahi dhang se lagu hui he yaa nahin yah bhi dekhne kii jarurat he

 AAP founder members Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav reacted immediately and denied the resignation

 arvind kejariwal hatenge yaa nahin iskaa faisla 28 march ko rashtriya parishad kii baithak main hoga
 Publicly, he says that Arvind Kejriwal is our leader, but privately he demands his removal
 arvind kejariwal ko hataane kii kisi bhi koshish ko main nahin sweekaar kar saktaa
 Now let the National Council decide on 28 March

 After this, Prashant Kishore did not look back

 In 2015, Prashant Kishor formulated a strategy of campaigning for JDU during the Bihar assembly elections

 Unsuccessful in UP, Congress won in Punjab 2016; Prashant Kishor's magic failed for the first time in 2016
 upi main congress ko aashaatheet safalataa nahin mili
 However the PK strategy in Punjab was successful and Captain Amarinder Singh became the Chief Minister in Punjab
 yahaan upi main congress ke parinaamon ko lekar sidhe pike ko jimmedaar tehraana bhi sahi nahin hoga
 Because as the election mercury was rising, reports of confrontation between the local leaders and Prashant Kishore also came to the fore

 The strategy of Prashant Kishore is clearly visible in Mamta Banerjee's aggressive attitude and the changing attitude of TMC, now it has to be seen how much their hard work brings
 ab pike ne aam aadmi party ke liye bhi vidhansabha chunaavon main ranneeti taiyaar karne kii jimmedaari le lee he
 There has also been a demand for Prashant Kishore abroad, who became the hero of Modi's victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 In 2015, while Prashant Kishore was preparing an election strategy for JDU in Bihar, on the other hand he was also giving election advice abroad

 Advantages to companies This increase in consumer losses may be good news for gas producers
 isse oengisi, oil india, vedanta, reliance jaisi apstream gas exploration karne vaali companiyon kaa rajasav bad jayega
 But this would be bad news for the consumer, as it would make compressed natural gas (CNG) and PNG used in vehicles expensive
 isse bijli utpaadan, urvarak utpaadan or petrochemical utpaadan kii laagat bhi bad jaaegi
 Wholesale price-based (WPI) inflation may also rise as gas prices rise

 But he could not get an entry
 logon ne bataaya ki ham samay par pahunche the
 Entered the line throughout the day but no entry was found
 kuch log kaafii naaraaz hue
 He said that we will not come to see the Delhi parade from next time
 unhone bataaya ki yahaan bahut buree vyavastha thi
 If the seat was full then no pass was given
 hamaara samay bhi kharaab ho gaya, paisa bhi gaya or parade bhi nahin dekh paae
 If someone had bought a ticket for Rs 500, then someone had bought a ticket for the parade by paying Rs 300
 dilli ke logon ko bhi nahin mili entridelli ke mayur vihaar main rahane vaale log apni daadi ko pehali baar parade dikhaane lekar pahunche the

 When these people could not see the parade, they saw the live parade on 'aaj Tak' in their mobile at Mandi House itself

 All these were rural kotwar or security personnel

 The Mayor of North Delhi has directed that the order of reduction of salary of MCD employees should not be implemented
 meyar kaa yah faisla ajtak par khabar dikhaae jane ke baad aayaa he
 Let us tell you that on 6 April, Aaj Tak had told how the North MCD employees are being blown away by the salary deduction order
 beete hafte hi south dilli kii meyar kamaljit saharaavat ne selary katautee ke aadesh ko south emsidi main lagu nahin karne ke nirdesh die the or ab north dilli kii meyar priti agarwal ne bhi adhikariyon ko nirdesh die hai ki is aadesh ko lagu naa kiya jaae

 meirpriti agarwalane karmchaariyon kii baton ko sunne ke baad nirdesh die ki aadesh ko lagu naa kiya jaae
 About 2200 employees working in North MCD have breathed a sigh of relief from this decision of Preity Aggarwal
 pradhanmantri karyaalay main rajya mantri jitendra singh ne kaha he ki vah congress samet tamaam raajnneetik guton se apil karte hai ki surakshakarmiyon ke manobal ko taak par rakhkar kisi tarah kii raajnneeti ne karen
 Before proceeding further, let us say that this statement of Jeetendra Singh came after the Congress and National Conference's charge that Army Chief General Bipin Rawat should explain to the youth and not use hooliganism
 guuruuvaar ko sena pramukh general bipin ravat ne hidaayat bhare lahaze main kaha tha ki sainya oparation ke dauraan javaanon par patharav karne vaale logon ko aatankwaadiyon kaa sahyogi mana jayega or unase sakhti se nibata jayega
 General Rawat said that those who want to help terrorism by showing the flag of ISIS and Pakistan will be considered anti-national and will not be spared
 sena pramukh ne yah bhi kaha ki - main chetavanee nahin, samajhane ke liye apni taraf se hidaayat de rahaa hum ki agar aap baj nahin aate hai or agar aap suraksha balon ke oparation main baadha banate hai to ham sakhti se karrwai karenge
 After this statement by the Army Chief, the Congress and other parties said that General Rawat should think before using such language
 neshnal conference ke netaa mustafa camel ne kaha tha ki 'is tarah kii bhashaa to gunde istemaal karte hai
 Comments udhar jitendra singh ne congress par aarope lagaaya ki he ki party khud se itani niraash he ki aise shabd laa rahi he jise loktantr ke itihaas main aaj tak istemaal nahin kiya gaya
 He said that the army chief has expressed concern, not a warning
 vah ek apil thi ki koi bhi firing line ke kareeb na aae lekin congress kuch or hi dikhaa rahi he
 Jitendra said that the Congress, which calls itself a national party, has been forced to speak the language of separatists for cheap politics
 soshal media par javaanon dwaara shikaayat karne ko lekar sena pramukh ne kahatha ki iske saath unhone yah bhi kaha ki hamaare kuch jawan hai jo soshal media main propaganda ke jariye ho saktaa he is tarah ke rukh ko apana rahe hon, lekin unka is tarah kaa ravaiya rahaa to ham sakhti se pesh aaenge
 On Thursday, Army Chief General Bipin Rawat said in a terse tone that those who pelted soldiers during a military operation would be considered as accomplices of terrorists and would be dealt with vigorously
 general ravat ne kaha tha ki jo log ISIS or pakistan ke jhande dikhaakar aatankwaad kii madad karnaa chaahate hai unako desh virdohi mana jayega or bakhsha nahin jayega
 The army chief also said that - i am not warning, i am instructing on my behalf to explain that if you do not come to the hawk and if you obstruct the operation of the security forces then we will take strict action
 sena pramukh ke isi bayaan ke baad congress or anya partiyon ne kaha ki general ravat ko is tarah kii bhashaa kaa istemaal karne se pehle sochna chahie
 National Conference leader Mustafa Kamal had said that 'goons use this kind of language
 'tippaniyan On the other hand, Jitendra Singh has accused the Congress that the party is so disappointed with itself that it is bringing words which have not been used in the history of democracy till date
 unhone kaha ki sena pramukh ne chintaa jataai he, na ki chetavanee di he
 It was an appeal that no one should come close to the firing line but the Congress is showing something else
 jitendra ne kaha ki congress jo apane aapako rashtriya dal kahati he, sasti raajnneeti ke liye algaavvaadiyon kii bhashaa bolne par majaboor ho gai he
 Regarding the complaint by the soldiers on social media, the army chief had said that with this he also said that there are some of our jawans who may be adopting such a stance through propaganda in social media, but their kind If attitude is there, we will act strictly

 khud ko dharmaguru bataane vaale asaram kii kerani ne unhen tamaasharam bana diya he, lekin ye tamaasha kanoon ko thenga dikhaa rahaa he
 Asaram's lyrics continued to give rise to controversies
 inke ashram or dharmik kriyakalapon par ungali uthati rahi
 He faced many serious allegations and now he has created a new controversy with a new speech
 is baar unka bol us rajya ke mukhyamantri ke liye he jis rajya kii police balaatkaar ke iljaam main asaram ko giraftaar bhi kar sakati he
 Baba Asaram, who describes himself as 74 years old, has been giving clarifications every now and then that he is not a rapist
 ram naam bhul gaye, kirthan bhajan bhul gaye
 What to do, the allegation is the same
 16 saal kii ladki ne baba par balaatkaar kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The rape allegations have disappointed Asaram
 tamaam saboot or ladki ke bayaan baba ko kathghare main khadaa kar rahe hai, baba kanoon ko kai baar chakma de chuke hai, lekin pehali baar balaatkaar ke maamle main fanse hai
 The screws of law are tightening around them
 ek naaballig ladki ne asaram par iljaam lagaaya ki jodhpur ke paas ek formahouse main unhone balaatkaar kiya, lekin kamaal dekhie ki rajasthan sarkaar harakat main nahin ai
 After all, what is the reason for Ashok Gehlot's silence? Has Asaram's old relationship with Gehlot not become a stone in the way of law? Asaram Bapu is still far from the legal grip
 maamla sansad main bhi pahunch chukaa he or hangaamaa bhi khub ho rahaa he lekin asaram baapu par bolne se rajasthan sarkaar or prashasan donon bhaag rahe hai
 After all, why Ashok Gehlot is making excuses not to arrest Asaram
 asaram baapu ne ahmedabad main kaha ki rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ko main sandeshaa bhejtaa rahata hum
 They also know me, they have come to me many times
 wo to aise aadmi hai ki kai baar aate-jate wo bina bulaaye hamaari gaushala main chale jate hai, itnaa prem he hamaari goshaala ke prati
 He also came to these things and said raw and sure that sadhus should improve their behavior
 mujhe ashrcharya hota he
 Asaram's relationship with Ashok Gehlot became very good from the very first term
 gahalot ke pehle kaarykaal main hi asaram ne rajasthan main apane ashram khole the
 The Gehlot government even gave 100 bighas of land to Asaram in Niwai in Tonk district in the name of Gaushala, which was inaugurated by Ashok Gehlot himself
 iske alaava rajasthan main asaram ke 23 ashram hai or 6 se zyada farm house hai
 Asaram has a large number of supporters in Rajasthan, while Ashok Gehlot is no less than a vote bank
 rajasthan sarkaar kii najaron main asaram ke kaddavar kad kaa andaja isi saboot se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki jab rajasthan ke mukhyamantri se aaj tak ne 23 agast ko baatcheet karne kii koshish kii to kaha gaya ki jo kuch kahana he hamane kal hi kah diya, baaki aap police se baat karen
 Till date reporters kept sitting outside the room of Rajasthan DGP Harishchand Meena, because it was said that Saheb was sleeping and when he woke up, the said DGP Saheb would meet on Monday
 rajasthan bijepi adhyaksh vasundhara raaje ke dhaulpur city pales ke baahar 6 ghante intjaar karaae jane ke baad kaha gaya ki madam ke paas raat nau baje tak vakt nahin he
 Off camera, police officials are clearly saying in the conversation that they have solid evidence that on August 15, Asaram and the girl were in the Hariom Ashram in Mathania, 30 km from Jodhpur
 lekin asaram kii giraftaar to dur abhi tak poochtacha kii ijaajat police ko nahin mili he
 Obviously, when Asaram himself is referring to the relationship with Ashok Gehlot, who is standing in the box of charges, then how to show any courage? Cleanliness is fine, but the question is why Asaram was not arrested despite the serious allegations like rape
 The After all, why the law has not reached Asaram yet? After all, who is saving Asaram? The Congress government of Rajasthan is facing questions about Asaram away from fearful arrest because the Gehlot government of Rajasthan is silent for several days after the case is filed
 siyaasi daanvpech kii majaburi aisi he ki poochtacha asaram se honi chahie thi, lekin asipi se lekar kamishnar tak poochtacha kar rahe hai peedita se hi
 In fact, the real saying behind this is that the Gehlot government is afraid of getting out of the hands of Asaram's Sindhi society and their blind devotees
 rajasthan main kareeb 40 siton par sindhi samaaj ke log apana prabhaav rakhte hai, jinamein asaram kii gahari paith he
 The Congress is afraid that the hatred of Asaram may prove to be a loss deal for him in the Assembly elections held at the end of the year
 bijepi bhi votbank dekhakar bad rahi havotbank kii raajnneeti main bijepi bhi peeche nahin
 Asaram is very close to Vasundhara Raje and BJP leaders
 tabhi to vot ke chakkar main andhi bijepi bhi peedita ke bajaay asaram ke saath khadi najar aa rahi he
 Whether it is Suman Sharma or Uma Bharti, President of Mahila Morcha of Rajasthan BJP, BJP is also running its vote bank

 kendriya soochna ayog ne geneticali modiphoid (jiem) food ke maamle main paardarshita na baratane ke liye paryaavaran mantralay kii khinchaai kii he
 The Central Information Commission has asked the government to make all the information and data related to GM Mustard (mustard) public before 30 April
 jiem mustard ko haalanki abhi kheton main bataur fasal ugane or bechney kii ijaajat nahin he lekin ise viksit kiya ja chukaa he
 If the Government's Genetic Engineering Approval Committee - which is the regulatory body in this case - allows for this, GM mustard will be the first GM food to be grown in the fields
 abhi hamaare desh main keval jiem kapaas ko hi ugaaya jaataa he
 The comments is bare main ek paryaavaran kaaryakarta kavita kuruganti ne sarkaar se jaankaree maangi thi, lekin paryaavaran mantralay kii ore se jaankaree na diye jane ke baad unhen kendriya soochna ayog kaa rukh karnaa padaa jisane is jaankaree ko zaahir karne kaa aadesh diya he
 There has been controversy about GM crops before
 isse pehle swasthya sambandhi khataron kaa dar jataate hue jiem bangan ko ugane kii anumati bhi nahin mil pai
 Environmental activists have complained that the government's genetic approval committee is not working transparently about this
 kendriya soochna ayog ne sarkaar se kaha he ki vah jiem mustard (sarson) se judi sari jaankaree or aankade 30 april se pehle saarvajanik kare
 Although GM Mustard is not yet allowed to grow and sell as a crop in the fields, it has been developed
 agar sarkaar kii genetic ejineering apruval cameti – jo ki is maamle main niamak body he - iske liye anumati detii he to jiem sarson pehla jiem khaadya hoga jise kheton main ugaaya jayega
 At present, only GM cotton is grown in our country
 tippaniyan Kavita Krugunti, an environmental activist, had sought information from the government about this, but after the information was not given by the environment ministry, she had to turn to the Central Information Commission which has ordered this information to be revealed

 Who is not a fan of Amitabh Bachchan, but two senior government officials in Chhattisgarh were overwhelmed by Amitabh's madness and were given notice

 notice ke bare main poochne par raut ne kaha ki wo shahar se baahar hai or unhen kisi notice ke bare main jaankaree nahi he
 However, due to this entire case being blamed, some officials believe that this may be their action for those who did not get a chance to share the stage with senior Bachchan
 naam naa bataane kii shart par ek adhikari ne kaha unhone kya galat kar diya
 Who wouldn't want to dance with the superhero? mjedaar baat ye he ki khud mukhyamantri raman singh ne amitabh kaa swaagat rajkeey suvidhaon ke saath kiya

 But recently, i noticed that the collection of Shayari Aziz Ansari's Hindi poetry in Indore - in the air is full of passion - but it seemed that in Indore itself, it is a specialty that poets like Aziz Ansari have been born before relief
 , Whose poetry is also not going to give any less relief
 raahat se aath saal bade or chhihattar ke ho chale azeez ansaari arase se akashwani main vibhinn padon par kaary karte rahe
 In the last years of the job, Indore retired from the post of Center Director in 2002 from All India Radio and continued to try his hand in ghazals, songs, Nat, Bhajan etc
 ab tak unki gazalon ke kai sangrah saaya ho chuke hai kintu sankochavash apane likhe ko der se chapaane ke kaaran ve kahin nepathy main rahe
 There are deep observances in the Ghazals of Aziz Ansari that make us deal with the complexities of life
 kaise duniya main chand log beyimaanion se amir banate gaye tathaa padhane-likhane vaali kaum ke haathon main talavaarein aa gayin
 Their ghazals say this in their own way - yesterday, the talaks were bare hungry, all in this village, where did these kothis and these cars come from? We had sent them to read 'aziz', where did these swords in their hands come from? ? Aziz Ansari's poetry is looking at all the evils of life, which cannot be overlooked by ordinary people
 siyasat ne gaye saalon main mulk ko hindu-muslim, mandir-masjid ke naam par itnaa tabah kiya he ki desh kii buniyadi tarakkee ke sthaan par hamane videshi takneekein aayaat kii hai tathaa ham electranik chijen khapaane vaale desh main badalte gaye
 The capital of the developed countries has made us continuously weak and technocratic
 paristhitiki ke maamle main hamane jitne samjhaute kiye hai, ve hamaare mulk kii behatari ke raste main avarohak sabit hue hai
 Another ghazal of Ansari Saab is Ashar Mulahija - Kale Khote is his business, he is a good owner; Poetry is full of human spirit
 usamen jivan kii dhoop chhaanv kii parachhaaiyaan hai, yatharth kii maarmik tahariren hai
 The tone of speech makes his poetry come alive, then Jeevanabhubhav adds color to the faithfulness in his poetry, he reminds the human being of the inconsistencies spread in life and also the way of his treatment
 badi bahar kii gajalen unke yahaan hai to choti bahar main bhi unhone khub likhaa he
 Where they live the realization that - Sahama - Sahama is living his life all around like fuel, and he also feels this euphoria - it has spread like it is happy with the arrival of Chandan
 bhale hi namchin shaayaron main unki naam shumaar nahin ho paaya ho par unki shaayari urdu kii jadid shaayari ke sthapaty se rachi basii he
 His style of saying is his own
 kis salike se ve yah baat kehete hai-saare gamon kaa ek thikaana hamaara dilasaare jahaan main apana thikaana kahin naheendharati he maa to maa hi mitaayegi bhukh bhikahata he koun dharti par dana kahin nahiskhmon kaa apane paas zakhira jo he 'azeez'aisa milegaa tumko khazaana kahin nahin
 The collection 'hawa Josh Mein Hai' will make Aziz Ansari popular among Hindi readers, no doubt
 ve kis tarah se apni shaayari ke jariye behatar jindagi kii salaahiyat pesh karte hai vah unki tamaam gazalon main kahin na kahin najar aa hi jaataa he
 How do i look like we are in this world, i see a lion in his own ghazal - where i have no respect for him, but i am not there
 jis tarah se hindi main urdu shaayari kaa dakhal musalsal bad rahaa he, hindi kii adbi duniya bhi nae lahaze se maalamaal ho rahi he, isamen sanshay nahin
 Aziz Ansari's poetry provides us with the new spirit of Ghazals, new architecture

 com par sampark kiya ja saktaa he
 Friends, brothers and sisters
 nae rishte bananaa pradhanmantri narendra modi ko behad pasand he
 But under the guise of these relationships, you will not expect more from the PM
 samajha kariye
 Not every human can be a CID inspector who breaks all closed doors
 modi in dinon puri duniya ke deshon, udyogpatiyon or tamaam niveshkon ko bharat aakar kisi bhi cheez kaa nirmaan karne ke liye kah rahe hai
 This invitation and scheme has been given the slogan of 'make in India' by the PM
 lekin mere or modi ji ke pyaare mitron, bahanon or bhaaiyon aap ye jaan lijie ki kuch aisi bhi dukhati rag hai, jinke bare main piem modi kisi se ye nahin kah sakate ki'kam mek in india'
 Know in which cases PM Modi will not say 'make in India' 1
 jawan banane kii dawa:hamaare mitra rupi piem kisi se ye nahin kah sakate hai ki aap bharat main jawan banane kii dawa banaaie kyonki agar aisi dawa ban gai, to sabase pehle jawan hone kii ichha laalkrishna adwani or murali manohar joshi ke man main ubal sakati he
 In such a situation, the compulsion to give opportunity to the youth (advani and Joshi) on the expectations of the 2019 election of PM Sahab may be overwhelming
 isiilie is dawa ke bare main modi nahin kah sakate ki mek in india
 2
 rahul gandhi kaa chhavi nirmaan:nanhen or pyaare se dikhne vaale rahul gandhi modi ke dhur virdohi hai
 Rahul's popularity is not that much compared to Modi's
 upar se wo modi ke kute vipakshi netaa bhi hai
 In such a situation, Modi cannot say to anyone that come to India and make Rahul Gandhi popular
 bhala koi apane liye gaddha khodta he kya
 Yes, it is also a matter of fact that children should not be put on a load in order to force them into politics
 3
 Dharna: The biggest obstacle on the path of development is its opposition
 vaise bhi jinke khud ke desh main kejariwal hote hai wo dharna dene ke liye kisi or se kaise kah sakate hai
 That is why Modi can never tell anyone that let us sit in India or unite to picket
 shukr he ki bharat is maamle main aatmanirbhar he
 Thanks to 'you'
 4
 Spying equipment: Spying and cheating are a sin
 snupaget maamle ne us vakt piem banane kaa sapana dekhne vaale modi ko jitna baichaiyn kiya, ye yaa to khuda jaanata he yaa amit shah
 The opposition was beginning to take on Modi as a 'cobra'
 in sabase kisi tarah ab modi nikal paae hai
 In such a situation, Modi will make someone tear up the dead by saying 'come make spy equipment in India'
 5
 Film on marriage: Oh
 ek baar phir dukhati rag
 In two separate nominations, Married and unmarried, and after the news of Mrs Jashodaben Modi appeared in the media, Modi's face may have been red but in red
 aise main piem sahab kisi diarector, produsar, hollywood or bollywood ke kisi insaan se yah nahin kah sakate ki aaie meri shaadi par koi film yaa documentry banaaie
 Do not say, 'come make in India' is better than becoming a film of an empty yellow film
 6
 New government: bjp's government has been formed after Modi's speech in the Bhagavata Purana, with the emphasis of millions of activists and from Amit Shah's heels to the top
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kisi bhi mulk main ye nahin kah sakate ki aaie bharat main sarkaar banaaie
 On your stomach
 oh maafee, apane deshbhakti ke sapanom par laat maarane kii himmat kisi main nahin hoti mitron
 7
 upiessi ke sawaalon kii hindi:rajnikant ko chhod diya jaae to puure vishwa main kisi main himmat nahin he ki wo upiessi exam ke sawaalon kii hindi samaj sake
 Almost every person of India understands this
 isiilie piem sahab kisi bhi desh ke goli sanganak (tablet computer) rupi dhurandhar se ye nahin kah sakate ki aaie bharat main upiessi exam kii hindi samajhie yaa anuwaad kaa koi software banaaie
 That's why don't make in India
 8
 Live TV Interview: Looking at the history so far, it is almost certain that Prime Minister Narendra Modi cannot say to any TV channel that let's take my live interview in India
 so dont mek dis van in india
 The reason behind this is probably to give comfort to the indigenous journalists that if you do not, no one is there
 virodhiyon ko ise swadesh prem kii bhaavana se jodakar dekhne kii jarurat he
 9
 pawan chakki:ek to ye logon kii itti gandi aadat he
 Where Modi's name is not heard, he starts arguing as soon as he hears wind and wave
 aise main piem sahab kisi se bhi ye nahin kah sakate ki kam mek pawan chakki in india
 Because the opposition can relate it to the Modi wave and say that Modi air is really only due to other people
 isiilie pawan chakki waalon 'na aana is desh meri lado' gaanaa suniye or chil rahiye
 10
 samskruti:bijepi, aresas or khud modi bhi bhartiya samskruti ke samarthak hai
 In such a situation, Modi cannot ask anyone to come to India and expand a new culture
 khaastaur par western culture
 Where the practice of 'khullam-khulla pyar karege hum both' is followed
 kisi nai samskruti ko bharat main mek(banane) se ganga safai main lagi uma bharti, pasaliyaan hilaate hue ramdev or yogi tip star prachaarak bura maan sakate hai or sabko saath na lekar chalanaa piem narendra modi ke mizaaj ke khilaaf he
 Note: If you are someone's alias devotee and reading this satire, your soul has been disturbed
 uske liye maaf kijiega par aapke liye sirf ek baat
 First please make democracy in India
 bolne, likhane kii aazaadee dene ke liye pathakon kaa shukriya
 Congress calls for investigation of Vasundhara's bungalow Congress bid - Raje spent 2,000 crore on the bungalow
 a round of accusations has started in Congress
 congress netaa ghanashyam tiwadi ne aarope lagaaya he ki purv mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne apana awaas bachaane ke liye 2017 main vidhansabha main purv mukhyamantriyon ke awaas or suvidha se sambandhit bill lekar ai thim
 Tiwari said that Vasundhara Raje has spent 2 thousand crores on that house
 yah koi purv mukhyamantri kaa awaas nahin balki rajmahal he, jisaki jaanch honi chahie
 After the High Court order, people should show the house how the government money has been misused
 bataa den ki ghanashyam tiwadi vasundhara raaje ke is awaas ko lekar kaaphi pehle se andolan chalaa rahe hai
 On the other hand, after this decision, Rajendra Rathore, the then Parliamentary Affairs Minister of the Vasundhara Government and now Deputy Leader of the bjp's Rajasthan Legislative Assembly, introduced the Bill in the Assembly in 2017, favoring Vasundhara Raje
 unhone kaha ki purv mukhyamantri kaaphi bade pad par baithe hue log hote hai, jinhen kai tarah kii suvidhaon kii jarurat hoti he
 He said that in view of these requirements, we had implemented these facilities
 ab rajasthan hai court kaa aadesh aayaa he to ham pehle uskaa adhyayan karenge
 But one thing is certain that the BJP carried forward the tradition of the Congress
 rathod ne kaha ki purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot se lekar congress ke sabhi purv mukhyamantriyon ko bangale kii suvidha thi or yah sab congress raaj main shuru hua tha
 Even after coming to power, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had advocated for this bill in the High Court
 purv mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke awaas khaali karne ke maamle par rajendra rathod ne kaha ki yah unka vyaktigat maamla he, lekin jab rajasthan hai court kaa aadesh aa gaya he to hamen lagata he ki sabhi ko iskaa paalan karnaa chahie
 The Rajasthan government has to decide whether to go to the Supreme Court against the High Court order, the BJP welcomes the decision of the Rajasthan High Court
 bataa den ki rajasthan hai court ne purv mukhyamantriyon ko bada jhatka diya he
 Justice Prakash Gupta has declared the Rajasthan Ministerial Pay Amendment Act 2017 invalid
 is adhinium ke tahat purv mukhyamantriyon ko rajasthan main kai suvidhaon kaa praavdhaan tha
 Now after the decision of the court, all the former chief ministers of the state will have to vacate their bungalows within 2 months and return the government staff
 court ke faisle ke mutabik purv mukhyamantriyon ko 2 maheene kaa samay diya jayega or uske baad agar vah khaali nahin karte hai to bazaar bhav se unase paisa liya jayega
 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi has denied the media reports that it was being claimed that seats have been divided for Lok Sabha elections in Kandi
 susheel modi ne twit karke kaha ki abhi endie main 2019 main hone vaaleam chunaavake liye na koi aupchaarik faisla hua he, na hi isko lekar koi vivaad he
 However, no decision has been taken yet on seat sharing
 hamaare saamne keval sabhi 40 siten jeetne kaa lakshya he
 There is no formal decision or any dispute on seat sharing for the 2019 elections in NDA
 hamaare saamne keval sabhi 40 siten jeetne kaa lakshya he
 All components are working on this objective

 com / jxovwcfscp — Sushil Kumar Modi (@sushilmodi) August 30, 2018 Deputy Chief Minister Modi said that all the constituents are working towards this objective
 chidiyaan kii aankh dekhne waalon ko or kuch najar nahin aata he
 Earlier, it was reported from the sources that the seat sharing formula has been prepared between the NDA constituents
 biharki 40 siton main se endie ne 31 siten jiti thim jinamembijapi22 siton par, lokjanshkti party 6 siton par or upendra kushvaha kii party araspi 3 siton par vijayi rahi thi
 This time, according to the new formula prepared by the Janata Dal United (JDU) joining the NDA, according to BJP 22 seats for 20 seats, Lok Janshakti Party for 5 seats for 6 seats and Upendra Kushwaha's party for 3
 You will get 2 seats instead
 mukhyamantrinithish kumaaraki party jediu jisane 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mahaj 2 siten jiti thi, is baar use 12 siten milengi
 One seat can be won by Arun Kumar, who was separated from Kushwaha's party, but Sushil Modi has rejected this formula by tweeting

 According to the bullet fired by knocking on the door of the cash van, the cash van of SIPL company was standing in the service lane in front of Axis Bank near Lucknow's VVIP Road Raj Bhavan
 cash vine ke andar suraksha guard indra mohan cash kaa bag haath main lekar baithe the
 Then a miscreant riding a motorcycle came and knocked on the door glass of the cash van and asked to open the gate, then Indra Mohan opened the mirror
 tabhi badmaash ne indra mohan ko goli maar di or unke haath se cash bag chin liya
 Hearing the sound of the bullet, the custodian Umesh standing nearby reached there, then the miscreant shot him on the leg too and looted the bag of cash and escaped
 goli kii awaz sunakar kuch log jamaa hue to do logon ko lahooluhaan padaa dekh police ko soochna di gai
 The police rushed the two injured to the hospital where guard Indra Mohan was declared dead, while Umesh is undergoing treatment
 ghatana ke baad cash vine ke chaalak ram sevak se police ghatana ke sambandh main poochtacha kar rahi he
 After this incident, the UP Police senses, because the incident took place in the safest area of uttar Pradesh
 police ke haath-paanv phoolne kaa andaja isi se lagaaie ki is ghatana ke turant baad dijipi bhi mauka-e-vaardaat par pahunche or khud jaanch kaa jimmaa sambhala
 The incident of robbery and murder between the Chief Minister's residence and the assembly was carried out by the unruly miscreant Dwarahatya and the sensational robbery of the robbery, which is also the bungalow of Law Minister Brijesh Pathak, a short distance from that place
 iske alaava ghatana sthal aisi jagah par he jahaan se din bhar viviipi movement hota rahata rahata he
 Apart from this, if seen from the site of the incident, then the distance of the Chief Minister's house assembly is also within a radius of two-two hundred meters
 ghatana sthal kaa raaj bhawan ke paas hona hi police kii mustaidi par sawalia nishaan lagaataa he
 Akhilesh tweeted on the incident of robbery and murder, and Tanjakhilesh Yadav took a target of the UP government by tweeting that there was a murder and robbery under the nose of the Governor and Chief Minister and now let us see what the government with an encounter would tell

 pichley dinon lakhanu main SSP kaa tabadalaa isliye kar diya gaya kyonki shahar main kuch aparaadh ho gaye the, lekin is badi vaardaat ke baad dekhnaa yah he ki yogi adityanath kis tarah kaa ection lete hai
 Video - a man-eater tigress Avni was killed varsh 2010-11 ke rail bajet se koi saptaah bhar pehle prasiddh saamaajik kaaryakarta evam narmada bachaao andolan kii netaa medha patkar ne rail mantri mamata banerjee se maang kii he ki vah nai ‘khanpan niti’ ghoshit karte samay is kaary main sthaneey logon kii adhiktam bhagidaari sunishchat karen
 Patkar said, 'indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) has a monopoly in the tender process in the current catering policy implemented by the Indian Railways
 nai niti main railway ko chahie ki vah is prakriya main adhik se adhik sthaneey logon kii bhagidaari sunishchit kare
 On the other hand, railway sources say that whether or not the new catering policy will be announced in the Railway Budget to be presented in the Lok Sabha by Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee, it is not yet decided but it is certain that it will be sometime from now Can also come
 saamaajik kaaryakarta medha patkar kaa aarope he ki railway kii vartmaan ‘khanpan niti’ main nihit swaarthee log nividaaon main anaap-shanaap dar bharkar prakriya main adnga lagane kaa prayaas karte hai, taaki isamen deree ho or is bich ve sambandhit adhikariyon ko prabhavit kar saken
 When asked about this, Chief Regional Manager posted at IRCTC Bhopal Virendra Singh said that the Railway Board has not issued any written instructions refusing to invite new tenders
 unhone kaha ki nai khanpan niti par rail mantri vichaar kar rahi hai or yah niti kabhi bhi aa sakati he
 It is noteworthy that in December last year, while presenting a 'white paper' on Indian Railways, the Railway Minister had said on the issue of taking away the catering license by some operators, 'the overall arrangement was to bring uniformity in the catering license and increase the participation of the local people
 Review is needed
 ’ saamaajik kaaryakarta medha patkar ne rail mantri mamata banerjee se vartmaan khanpan niti ke kaaran railway steshnon se hataae gaye logon ke punarvaas kii bhi maang kii he
 He said that railway work is not only to earn profit, but also to provide employment opportunities to maximum people
 siyasat gunjaaish se shuru hoti he
 On 22 January, when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president Amit Shah's rally in Malda, West Bengal, gathered a fair crowd, it was probably a search for the same scope that the saffron party would take seats from the central and western areas of the country
 Wants to compensate for the potential loss of new land
 is raily kii ahmiyat ko isi baat se samajha ja saktaa he ki malda pahunche shah bukhaar se tap rahe the par raily sthagit nahin kii gai
 In this meeting, BJP leader Rahul Sinha shouted: Ladai sarasari BJP vs Trinamule
 
 
 jaikhene padam phool aise che, oikhene choti-choti ghaser fooler kii darkaar? (ladaai sidhe-sidhe bhaajapa banaam trinmul kii he
 
 
 Where the lotus flower has arrived, what is the need of small grass (trine) flowers now?) BJP also wants this
 vah pashchim bengal main chunavi ladaai ko sidhe-sidhe bhaajapa banaam trinmul karnaa chaahati he or uski najar un swing voton par he jo pichley chunaavon tak communiston ke paale main the or amuman mamata virdohi vot hai
 The BJP fears that it may lose half the seats in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
 lihaaja, party ne isaki bharpai ke liye mishan 123 shuru kiya he
 The campaign is to win maximum of the 123 Lok Sabha seats that the party could not win in 2014 despite the raging Modi wave
 pichley saal hi, bhaajapa ne in 123 siton ko 25 samoohon main baantkar inke prabharee niyukt kar die the
 Now, when elections are absolutely head over, the party has shifted focus to booth level
 yah narendra modi-shah kii aisi ranneeti he jisane pichley saadhe chaar saal main takreeban sabhi vidhansabha chunaavon main achche nattejey die hai
 Of these 123 prospective parliamentary seats, 77 are in West Bengal, Assam and Odisha only
 inamen se 2014 main bhaajapa sirf 10 par jeet hasil kar pai thi
 If the West Bengal BJP is finding very fertile land, then it is not mere silence
 pichley panchayat chunaav main bhagava party ne sattadhari trinmul congress ke dabadabe ke baavjood achche nattejey hasil kiye or vam morche ko peeche chhodkar duusare paaydaan par aa gai
 Now BJP strategists are eyeing about 22 seats
 maujuuda loksabhaa main pashchim bengal se bhaajapa ke paas mahaj do siten—asanasol or darjeeling—hi hai
 But under the latest strategy, the main battlefield of BJP is Jungle Mahal area of the state
 bhaajapa pichley kuch samay se is kshetra main kaaphi sakriy he
 Shah had expressed his intention to hold a meeting with party leaders in Purulia district on June 28, six months earlier
 saath hi, pradhanmantri modi ne bhi midanapur main 'krishi kalyaan samavesh' raily kii thi
 The signs are clear
 vaise, purulia, bankuda or pashchim midanapur jilon main failaa jangal mahal ek daur main maovadiyon kaa majboot garh tha or yahaan chah loksabhaa siten hai
 Recently there has been good news for BJP from this area
 haalia panchayat chunaav main trinmul congress ke mul vot bank adivaasiyon ke samarthan main badlaav dikhaa he, jisase trinmul ne teen jilon main kam se kam 34 fisad panchayat siten kho di hai
 Despite several successful government schemes in the Jungle Mahal, Trinamool could not file nomination in some tribal panchayat areas of Jhadgram and prevented BJP from taking the lead
 trinmul ke sutara bataate hai ki jangal mahal ilaake main sabhi takatein mamata ke khilaaf ekajute ho gai hai
 In these districts, these forces gave secret support to the BJP and the party won one-third of the gram panchayats in Purulia district and almost half of the seats in Jhargram district
 isliye, bhaajapa kaa sara dhyaan balurghat, kuchbihar, alipur duaar, jalpaigudi, malda uttar, purulia, jhadiram, medinipur, krishnanagar or haavda jaisi uttari bengal or jangal mahal ke janajaatiy varchasv vaale siton par he
 But bjp's mission Bengal will not be so easy
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main soobe main bhaajapa ko do loksabhaa siten hasil hui thim or 16
 8 percent votes were received
 lekin 2016 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa kaa vot share girakar 10
 It was 2 percent
 asal main, bhaajapa ke ganit ke duusare pahalu bhi hai
 In 2014, BJP stood second in three Lok Sabha seats
 pichhali dfa bhaajapa pahari ilaakon main gorkha janamukti morcha (jijeem) ke saath gathbandhan main thi or isaki vajah se darjeeling seat uske khate main ai thi
 But this time the path to Darjeeling seat will also not be easy
 2014 main is seat se trinmul congress ne mashhoor footbal khilaadi bichung bhutia ko bhaajapa ke es
 s
 ahaluwalia ke khilaaf utaara tha
 The BJP overcame this challenge with the help of GJM and the swiftness of the Modi wave
 par is baar jijeem-bhaajapa gathjod tut chukaa he
 In such a situation, the present seat is also under threat
 2014 main bhaajapa jin teen losasabha siton par duusare sthaan par rahi thi unamem se do kolkata ke shahari kshetra main padati hai
 BJP is worried that Kolkata is Mamta's own area
 bhaajapa ke duusare paaydaan vaali teesri seat malda dakshin seat thi, jahaan muslim aabaadi kul aabaadi ke aadhe se adhik he
 The seven assembly seats in which BJP had finished second in the last assembly elections have mostly been scattered
 bhaajapa chunavi baitarani paar karne ke liye soobe main kuch sweekaarya chehron kii talash main he
 The ruling Trinamool Congress leader Mukul Roy has already joined the BJP and after the arrival of Soumitra Khan, the BJP is no longer dependent on faces like Roopa Ganguly and Lockett Chatterjee
 pashchim bengal bhaajapa ke rahul sinha or dilip ghosh jaise jamini netaa sangharsh to kar rahe hai par unka janaadhar adhik vyapak nahin he
 As such, the party is in search of some popular and famous candidates
 khan ke bhaajapa main aane ke baad abhinetri mausami chatarji bhi haal hi main bhaajapa main shaamil ho chuki hai
 BJP sources say that at least six Trinamool mps are in touch with him
 inamen se adhiktar roy ke kareebi maane jate hai
 Muslim votes prove extremely decisive in West Bengal elections
 asal main, vam kaa kila dhahne ke peeche kii kai vajahon main ek muslim voton kaa paala badalakar mamata ke peeche aa khadaa hona bhi tha
 But due to the strong presence of the family of Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary and late ABA Gani Khan Chowdhury in North Bengal, the Congress is strong in at least six seats in that area and the Muslim voters there are in favor of the Congress
 congress ne 2014 main jin chaar siton par jeet hasil kii thi, unamem se sari uttar bengal main hai
 Malda, Murshidabad and North Dinajpur have a majority Muslim population, while South Twenty Four Parganas, North Twenty Four Parganas, Nadia and Virbhum districts have more than one-fourth of the Muslim population
 sachaai he ki bengal main musalamaanon kaa saath chunaav jitau sabit hua he
 By 2006, the Left Front had the support of Muslims and its victory was equally huge
 lekin 2009 ke loksabhaa chanaavon se paridrishy badalanaa shuru hua, jab trinmul congress-congress gathbandhan ne kareeb saath fisadi muslim bahul siten jitkar kul 26 sansadeey siten hathiyaa leen
 The same happened in the 2011 assembly elections
 par 2014 main trinmul kaa congress ke saath gathjod tut gaya phir bhi mamata musalamaanon kii pasandida bani raheen
 Trinamool won 34 seats
 pichley chaar chunaavon main trinmul ne muslim bahul 39 fisadi siton par jeet hasil kii he
 However, this time the BJP has a stake in making a dent in its vote bank in the places where the Left Front's base has fallen
 soobe main aisi 36 vidhansabha siten hai jahaan muslim aabaadi apekshaakrit kam he, vahaan trinmul kii baaki partiyon par badhat ghatakar 12 fisadi ho jaati he
 Here are the seats where the BJP can cherish dreams of victory by polarizing Hindu votes
 duusari taraf, kam se kam 14 loksabhaa siten aisi hai jahaan muslim aabaadi 40 fisadi tak he
 Here the vote share difference (left Front vs Congress vs Trinamool) is around 10%
 yahaan bhaajapa muslim voton main bahukoniya mukaable se hone vaale sambhavit bantwaare or hindu voton ke dhruvikaran par ummiden tikaa rahi he
 If there is a split in Muslim votes, the BJP mustache
 party rajya main muslim voton kii ahmiyat ko samaj rahi he
 Therefore, the party fielded about 850 Muslim candidates in the panchayat elections and nearly half of them won
 bhaajapa kii ranneeti he ki bengal main muslim voton ko kahin ekamusth na jane diya jaae or use bahukoniya mukaable main baantkar hindu voton ko ekajute kar liya jaae
 The BJP had planned to take out a rath yatra in the state to consolidate Hindu votes
 teen charnon main hone vaali is yatra ke jariye rajya ke 77,000 matdaan kendron ko chuaa jaataa
 But the state government refused to approve the yatra and threw water on the party's plans
 22 janvari ko malda kii raily main shah ne kaha, ''mamata didi ko dar tha ki hamaari rathyatra nikali to rajya main trinmul sarkaar kii antim yatra nikal jaaegi
 Not only Shah to unite the Hindu votes, all the leaders from the stage in Malda raised the issue of infiltration from Bangladesh, citizenship of non-muslims who had become refugees from there
 shah ne to saaf kaha, 'durga puja visarjan hamen yahaan nahin karne diya jayega to kya visarjan pakistan jaakar kiya jayega?'' durga puja visarjan vaale maamle par soobe main kaaphi ho-hallaa machaa tha or uski yaad dilaakar, jaahir he, bhaajapa hinduon ko bhavuk karnaa chaah rahi he
 The first of the bjp's all-round strategy in Bengal is to separate the alienated votes in its favor
 iske liye bhaajapa apane sitara prachaarkon ko maidan main utaar rahi he
 Apart from Modi and Shah, Rajnath Singh, Yogi Adityanath and Shivraj Singh Chauhan are scheduled to hold more than 100 gatherings in the state's 32 seats in the next two months
 loksabhaa chunaav tak party ne kul 300 sabhaaon kii yojana banaai he
 State BJP vice-president Jayaprakash Majumdar says, "modi ji will draw attention to how such (opposition's) opportunistic alliances have kept governments falling and had to hold elections again and again
" '' jaahir he, bhaajapa kii koshish mamata virdohi maton ko ek paale main laane kii he
 According to BJP sources, the Left Front will retain anti-mamata votes in the 34 Lok Sabha seats where it secured at least 3 lakh votes by staying second
 soobe main apni paith ko adhik shashakt karne ke liye bhaajapa bengal ke pratik purushon ko apane chunavi abhiyaan kaa hissaa bana rahi he
 In front of the huge crowd in Malda, Shah says, "when Mamta held a rally at the Brigade Ground, no one shouted Bharat Mata ki Jai or Vande Mataram
 inhen modi ke alaava abhi kuch nahin sujh rahaa he
 It was not a coincidence that a large cutout of Subhash Chandra Bose was present on stage at Shah's rally and Shah in his speech not only Netaji Bose, but Swami Vivekananda, Rabindranath Tagore, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Bankimchand Chattopadhyay, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee
 , Mentioned many times to Batukeshwar Dutt and Suryasena
 ab bhaajapa chunaav ghoshit hone se pehle rajya ke vibhinn hisson main modi kii chaar reliyon kii taiyaari main he
 The first of these was to be held in Kolkata on 8 February, but it has been postponed for a few days after Mamta's massive rally
 ab bhaajapa apni raily main baari bheed dikhaane ke liye taiyaari karnaa chaahati he
 The BJP can now be a complete attacker on Mamta as she has no compulsion to take a soft stand in support of GST
 bhaajapa ke aakraamak ravaie se mamata bhi kaaphi chaukanni ho chuki hai
 He has issued instructions to the Trinamool leaders to continue in their respective constituencies
 mamata ne kaha, ''jab bhi bhaajapa jhooth failaae, aap turant uskaa virodh karen
 "but perhaps that was not enough
 mamata ne duusare upaay bhi kiye hai
 On February 2, the place of Modi's rally in Thakurnagar of North 24 Parganas was booked by the Trinamool leader in advance
 29 janvari ko purvi midanapur main shah kii raily ek bhaajapa samarthak ke khet main honi thi
 But on the provocation of Trinamool, the neighboring farmer wrote a report to the police about the possibility of his farm getting spoiled
 isse shah kii raily par 28 janvari kii raat tak ashankaayen chai raheen
 On 23 January, Union Minister Smriti Irani had to cancel her rally at Suri in Virbhum as the Mamta administration did not allow her helicopter to land at the government helipad
 bhaajapa ko, jaahir he, isamen sajeesh najar aa rahi he
 State BJP president Dilip Ghosh says, "the government did the same dirty politics at Shah's rally on January 22
 '' in kadamon main mamata kii bechaini jhalkati he
 This uneasiness also abounds with the way the BJP is spreading its wings in the state
 —saath main romita datta*** Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the country's first full-time woman, presented the first general budget of the second term of the Modi government in Parliament
 apane bajet main nirmala sitaraman ne samaaj ke sabhi virgon ke saath mahilaon kaa bhi khaas dhyaan rakhaa
 In the budget speech, Nirmala Sitharaman said that the country cannot progress without the development of women
 'nari tu narayani' kehete hue vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne bajet pesh karte hue elaan kiya ki jandhan khatadharak mahilaon ko 5000 rupee overdraft kii suvidha di jaaegi
 Apart from this, a separate loan of one lakh rupees will be arranged for women
 mahilaon ko kya phayda hoga2014 main modi sarkaar aane ke baad se hi jandhan yojana ke tahat bank khate khulwaane kaa kaam kiya gaya he
 a woman who has a Jan Dhan account, can withdraw money even if there is no money in her account
 ab tak mahilaayein apane jandhan khate se sirf 2 hajaar rupee hi nikaal sakati thim, jise badhaakar ab 5 hajaar rupee kar diya gaya he
 This is called overdraft facility
 duusari taraf modi sarkaar ke pehle kaarykaal kii mudra yojana kaa laabh bhi is baar mahilaayein le sakengi
 Modi government has been saying that large scale employment opportunities have been created in the country using Mudra loans
 ab nai sarkaar kaa pehla bajet pesh karte hue nirmala sitaraman ne bataaya ki mahilaayein is yojana ke tahat 1 lakh tak kaa lone le sakengi
 However, this facility will be for women associated with SHG

 The atmosphere in the Supreme Court changed when Justice JS Kehar, who was hearing a case, questioned the red color on the petitioner's hands
 darasal supreme court main jaimahabharat party kii yachika par sunwaayee chal rahi thi
 The petition said that in the last Lok Sabha elections, the party fielded candidates for 25 Lok Sabha seats in different states
 lekin chunaav ayog ne ummidavaaron ko aath alag-alag chunaav chihn die jisaki vajah se kaaphi pareshaani hui
 The petition has demanded that the Election Commission give the election mark to the party at the time of registration

 During the hearing on Monday, the Election Commission said that work is being done in this direction and it will take time to reach the result
 justise kehar ne kaha ki chunaav ayog 6 hafton main iskaa hal nikaalen
 Meanwhile, looking at the red hands of party president Vishwa Mohan, who was presenting his side, Justice Kehar asked what had been put on his hands
 yachikakarta ne kaha ki wo lakshmi kii puja karte hai
 The judge said that he should not come to the court with red color because this color distracts his attention
 isi bich vishwa mohan ne kaha ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main unki party desh main sarkaar banaaegi
 On this, Justice Kehar said that the Attorney General is sitting behind and he does not like such things

 ek disambar se teen disambar tak bulandshahr main desh or duniya bhar se aae kareeb das lakh musalmaan ek iztima main hissaa le rahe the
 Ijtima ends on December 3
 das lakh kii bheed ab apane-apane ghar ko lautne lagati he
 And at the same time a crowd of about four hundred people makes a roadway
 iztima se laut rahe bahut saare log isi raste se guzarane vaale the
 Things were very tense
 aage kuch bhi ho saktaa tha
 And from here, the question arises that what happened in Bulandshahr on Monday was a conspiracy behind it? More than a million people were returning from Ijtima
 chaar sau ke qareeb bheed rasta roke thi
 a handful of policemen were standing in front
 teen disambar ko kuch bhi ho saktaa tha bulandshahr main
 On December 1, 2018, Dariyapur, Bulandshahr Alami Ijtima Committee, Dariyapur organized Ijtima in Bulandshahr
 iztima main amuman sharai yani sharia se jude masale or unke hal kii baaten kii jaati hai
 At the same time, training is given about Deen
 takreeren hoti hai
 It has nothing to do with politics or political matters
 amuman aise iztima main desh ke alaava duniya ke alag-alag mulkon ke bhi log shirkat karte hai
 This Ijtima was to be held from December 1 to December 3 and for this, necessary permission was also obtained from the authorities
 haalanki kehete hai ki prashasan ne do lakh logon kii ijaajat di thi
 While more than a million people visited Ijtima
 iztima ke liye bulandshahr ke dariyapur gaanv ke alaava arauli, akbarpur or mirgoopur gaanv main bhi intjaam kiye gaye the
 The first two days of Ijtima pass completely peacefully
 ab bas iztima kaa aakhri din tha
 On December 3, around 11 am near Chingrawati outpost area, Mahav village, Bulandshahrsubah, some remains of animals were found lying in the forest near Mahav village
 jisapar aas-paas ke gaanvon ke logon kii nazar padi
 It was said that food was being prepared for those involved in Ijtima
 jangal main usee ke avshesh phenke gaye hai
 However, no one tried to know whether these were the remains of cows, buffaloes or goats
 bas isi ke baad sthaneey log bhadak gaye, yaa phir unhen bhadakaayaa gaya
 It started with 50-60 people
 unhone chaowkee chingravathi ke saamne pradarshan shuru kar diya
 His demand was that the police should immediately investigate the case and file an FIR and arrest the culprits
 pradarshan ke dauraan kuch log bulandshahr syana maarg par bhi pahunch gaye or road jam kar diya
 Now call it a coincidence or a conspiracy that Ijtima was over at the time when it all started and now a crowd of millions was returning to their respective homes from Bulandshahr
 unke ghar jane kaa ek rasta wo bulandshahr syana maarg bhi tha jise jam kar diya gaya tha
 The breath of the police had swelled
 bheed ugr thi
 On the other hand, people were going back from Ijtima
 raste main kuch bhi ho saktaa tha
 There may have been clashes between the crowd and those returning from Ijtima
 kehete hai ki is cheez kaa andaja police ko bhi tha or police ne subah hi prashasaan se or force kii maang kii thi
 But force was not provided in time
 baaki us vakt jo force maujuud thi wo is najuk halaat se nipatane ke lihaaj se behad kam thi
 And this is what the crowd took advantage of
 maukey par achaanak afvaah failaai jaati he
 People are instigated
 danga bhadakaayaa jaataa he
 The crowd fires when they kill each other
 ye sab hote-hote bheed ne jab police chaowkee par hamalaa bolaa tab tak teen gaanvon ke kareeb 400 log jamaa ho chuke the
 a mob armed with swords, lathis, poles and desi kattas attacked the police first, then at the outpost, then set the vehicles on fire and finally shot and killed Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh
 haalanki jis jagah bheed ne ye tamaam hangaamaa kiya, wo jagah iztima ke aayojan sthal se kareeb 50 kilometre dur thi
 Otherwise guess what could have happened

 is dauraan ghar main peedita akeli thi, lekin jab peedita ke parijan ghar waapas aae to dekha ki unki beti nahin he
 When the daughter did not come till late night, the victim's family informed the Lonar police
 iske baad bhi kisi bhi tarah kii karrwai nahin hone par ladki kaa pita subah taharir lekar thane gaya
 The police kept them sitting in the police station till the evening and later sent them home without writing a report

 After that, the victim told the story of the incident that took place with her

 majalis-e-ittehdul muslimin (emm) ke adhyaksh asaduddin ovaisi ne buudhvaar shaam ajtak kii ankar anjana om kashyap se khaas baatcheet kii
 He gave his opinion on the Pulwama attack and BJP politics from the current Lok Sabha elections
 asaduddin ovaisi ne kaha ki suraksha ke mudde par ve hameshaa sarkaar ke saath khadey rahe hai lekin pulavama hamale ke baad bijepi netaaon ne raajnneetik rotiyaan senkani shuru kar di hai jisamen ve naakaam rahe hai
 Owaisi said that Rahul Gandhi is still learning politics
 priyanka gandhi ke bare main kaha ki vah unhen nahin jaanate kyonki wo raajnneeti main nai ai hai
 In the beginning of this special conversation, Aaj Tak asked Owaisi that BJP has nationalism, Bharat Mata ki Jai, but what do you have? In response, Asaduddin Owaisi said, 'we have the constitution given by Baba Bhim Rao Ambedkar, which is bigger than all these BJP issues
 samvidhan jiske paas hoga, sabase badi takat uske paas hogi
 That is why when i speak of the Constitution, the Sangh Parivar, BJP does not have any answer
 'asaduddin ovaisi se aglaa sawaal poocha gaya ki chunaav ke vakt unako samvidhan kii yaad nahin aati or bif biryani kii baat hone lagati he
 Why so? In response, Asaduddin Owaisi said, 'when the 2014 elections were going on, Narendra Modi was saying in the election campaign that the people of Pakistan had come to India whom we fed Biryani
 maine unheen kaa jumala yaad dilaane ke liye aisa bayaan diya tha
 'asaduddin Owaisi also expressed his opinion on the Pulwama attack
 unhone kaha, 'bijepi abhi khel rahi he, baar-baar apni kamajoriyon ko chupaane ke liye mudde uthaae jate hai
 Who is responsible for the Pulwama attack? ham maanate hai ki pakistan ne un logon (aatanki) kii madad kii lekin aap (piem modi) kyon khamosh baithe the
 How did RDX go there in such a large number
 iske peeche koun jimmedaar he
 Why did you not remove any minister, any officer
 desh main sarkaar aapaki he, jammu kashmir main governor aapkaa he, to isaki raajnneetik jimmedaari bhi to aap par aati he lekin koi ection lene ko taiyaar nahin
 'asaduddin Owaisi is often accused of running the bjp's agenda
 isapar unhone kaha ki ham kisi kaa agenda nahin chalaa rahe balki bijepi ko expoj kar rahe hai
 BJP is not getting ready to take responsibility for Pulwama because they know that they will be exposed
 pulavama hamale ke saboot maangane or isamen kitne aatanki maare gaye, iske jawaab main asaduddin ovaisi ne kaha ki 'pakistan ke khilaaf air strike jarur hui
 We have reservations about whether Rajnath Singh is telling the truth or what the Foreign Secretary of the Government of India has said is true
 meraa maananaa he ki jo stand videsh sachiv ne diya wo sach he
 What the Indian Air Force chief said is true
 baaki rajnath singh, amit shah, ahaluwalia, krishi mantri sab apni siyaasi roti senkane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Some say 250, some say 300, some say 150, Ahluwalia says that killing was not the motive
 isliye pulavama ko lekar inhen bataanaa chahie ki inaki galati se ardex vahaan tak pahunchaa
 Asaduddin Owaisi said that the mood of the country has become such that if he speaks anything against Narendra Modi, he is called a traitor
 pakistan jane kii baat kah dete hai
 We do not tolerate these moods because we have been speaking against it
 musalamaanon ke khilaaf soch pichley paanch saal main badi he
 This thinking will have to change
 musalamaanon par baar baar shaq karnaa thik nahin he
 In response to the question of what is the most important issue in the country at present, Asaduddin Owaisi said that employment is the biggest issue for the youth
 desh kii jo sansthaaen hai
 Its strength is also very important
 narendra modi ko unhone jumala polytics se joda to rahul gandhi ke bare main kaha ki abhi ve rajaneta ban rahe hai
 Regarding Priyanka Gandhi, Owaisi said that he does not know her as she has just entered politics
 nitin gadakari ke bare main ovaisi ne kaha ki ve nagpur main apni party ke andruni kalah se chunaav haar sakate hai
 The Lok Sabha election campaign has reached its final stage and all political parties have given their strength for the seventh phase

 Money will go to the account of women
 saath hi vaada kiya ki sarkaar banane ke pehle saal main 22 lakh logon ko rojgaar denge
 Attacking the Modi government at the Center, Congress President Rahul Gandhi said that Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister of India and promised to give jobs to the youth of the country every year, but what happened to his promise
 56 inch ke pradhanmantri ne yah bhi vaada kiya ki logon ke khate main 15 lakh rupye daale jaaenge
 The Congress President said that a large number of jobs will be created through the justice scheme
 satta main aane ke ek saal ke andar 22 lakh khaali padon ko jald bharaa jayega
 The youth will be given employment through the panchayat
 unhone kaha, 'maine piem modi se khule main bahes karne kii chunauti di thi
 Everything will be cleared in just 15 minutes of debate
 main aaj 4 sawaal karuunga
 He will not be able to answer my questions
 lekin congress logon ko sach bataaegi
 Rahul Gandhi surrounded the Modi government on demonetisation saying that the decision of demonetisation brought everyone in line
 apane paise ke liye logon ko sangharsh karnaa padaa
 He promised that farmers would be given a good price for their crop, but what happened
 mek in india kaa kya hua
 If you look on the left, India, look on the right, but the government failed to give employment to the people
 karjamaafee par sarkaar ko gherte hue rahul gandhi ne kaha ki narendra modi ne ek bhi kisaan kaa karja maaf nahin kiya, lekin unhone 15 amir logon ke hajaar karod rupye maaf kar die
 Whereas we want to give money to the poor
 1984 ke sikh dange par sam pitroda ke 'hua to hua' vaale bayaan bolte hue rahul gandhi ne kaha ki sam ko iske liye maafee maangani chahie

 maakan ne kaha ki yah puri tarah modi sarkaar kii vifaltaa he ki ek vaishvik imaarat kaa rakrakhaav sarkari kharchen par nahin karvaa paa rahi he
 Ajay Maken said that Narendra Modi himself roams abroad after spending crores of rupees, wears so expensive clothes, while on the other hand he is avoiding to bear the cost of maintenance of the Red Fort

 kuch yun congress netaa digvijay singh ne bina ruke 6 maheene 11 din main narmada kii parikrama kaa samaapan kiya
 Such a view of Sanatan Dharma which was completely opposite to the previous role of Digvijay Singh in politics
 digvijay kii chhavi centre kii siyasat main aane ke baad pro-muslim kii rahi he
 Who can forget his statements at special times
 bottla house cond or laden kii maut ke vakt digvijay ke bol unki chhavi kharaab karte gaye
 Then the terrorist sat calling Hafiz Saeed
 or to or upi chunaavon main muslimon ko aarakshan kii vakaalat bhi karne vaale wo hi the
 In the new innings, in the changed style, in the political equation, the political player as if in politics, made his inning plan afresh
 khaadi kaa chola utaar pile vastra dhaaran kar liye or nikal padenarmada kii kathin pad yatrapar
 Declaring the visit as religious, he also announced no political rhetoric for 6 months
 shaayad digvijay ko bhi rahul or congress kii tarah 2014 main bani apni anti hindu chhavi kaa ehsaas ho chalaa tha
 His wife continued with him like a cult Hindu woman during this journey
 raste main mandiron ke darshan karte, sant or muniyon kaa aashirwad lete ye jodi sanathan hindu parampara kaa adarshavaadi tareeke se paalan karti rahi
 After this, Jaisadigvijay announced that after completing the yatra, he would not fry any pakoras but would openly do politics
 wo najar bhi aa gaya
 On one side the yatra was coming to an end, on the other hand Manjar was telling that, Digvijay's future politics is also starting from here
 manch se siyasat duuradigvijay ke is dharmik manch par sadhu-santon ke bich aahista-aahista madhya pradeshcangresske tamaam diggaj aane lage
 Kamal Nath, state president Arun Yadav, former Union minister and MP Kantilal Bhuria, Rahul's close Meenakshi Natarajan, senior leader Suresh Pachauri, MP and Congress's legal cell chief Vivek Tankha, including state in-charge general secretary Deepak Bavaria also sat on the dais
 manch dharmik tha isliye siyaasi baaten to nahin huin, lekin har vaktaa kii jubaan par digvijay kii tarif ke pul the
 The legendary Kamal Nath even said that Digvijay is my brother, i salute him
 wo hamaari aan baan shaan hai
 At the same time, actor Ashutosh Rana, who aspired to try his luck in politics, called Digvijay a Rajarshi
 rana ne kaha ki digvijay raja to hai hi, lekin narmada parikrama karke wo rishi bhi ho gaye
 So i will call him Rajarshi
 manch par siyasat main digvijay apana dabadabaa dikhaa rahe the, tabhi madhya pradesh congress kii siyasat main kya hone ja rahaa he, uski bhanak bhi lag rahi thi
 After all, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Satyavrat Chaturvedi were not present on the stage
 kaarykram ke samaapan ke turant baad ajtak se khaas baatcheet main digvijay ne centre or rajya kii siyasat ke lihaaj se apane iraade jaahir kar die
 Will end factionalism, digvijaydigvijay Singh said that he is not in the race for the post of CM of Madhya Pradesh, but if the high command says, he is ready to unite everyone for the sake of Congress by ending factionalism, mutual pulls and fuss of the state Congress i
e
 State Congress He describes himself
 saaf he ki digvijay ab madhya pradesh congress kii raajnneeti menking nahin kingmekarbanana chaahate hai
 Digvijay, who was CM after the party's defeat in the state in 2003, announced not to contest elections for the next 10 years and not to interfere directly in the state's politics
 jiske baad wo 2014 main jaakar rajyasabha kaa chunaav ladakar saansad bane
 Now his eyes are again on the politics of the state, but in the role of Chanakya or Pitamah
 rajya ke saath hi digvijay kaa centre kii siyasat kaa bhi plan taiyaar he
 In his desire to interfere in the internal politics of the party, he openly says that the decision was beyond his comprehension, which he did not even know, on the question of the Congress not being able to save bail in the Phulpur and Gorakhpur by-elections
 party main bade kad kii chaahacentre main digvijay sirf mahasachiv rahakar mahaj ek rajya kaa prabhaar sanbhaalane kii bajaay rashtriya raajnneeti main apana bada kad chaahate hai
 That is why he says that he was the secretary general for 14 years, how much work will i do now
 agar janardan dvivedi kii tarj par rahul mujhe badalte hai to mujhe koi dikkat nahin
 But Digvijay does not stop here
 wo saath hi jodate hai ki rahul badlaav ke liye koi bhi faisla karen, vah unke saath hai
 But Rahul will have to keep harmony between youth and experienced leaders
 madhya pradesh main november main chunaav hone hai, narmada yatra ke dauraan digvijay rajya kii kareeb 114 siton main ja chuke hai
 His close friend says that his next plan is to visit the entire state
 shaayad isiilie digvijay kehete hai ki chunaav jeetna he to rajya ke netaaon ko janata ke bich janaa hoga or unke man kii baat sunani hogi
 According to Digvijay's close people, he is not entitled to make someone the face of CM in the state
 aakhir isi daanv se hi to wo kingmekar bananaa chaahate hai
 But the political players are well versed in the culture of the Congress
 isliye kehete hai ki rajya kii siyasat ho yaa centre kii yaa apana siyaasi bhavishya, wo sab sabase pehle party adhyaksh rahul gandhi se charchaa karenge
 Rahul's open waiver: In terms of the politics of the center, he continues to make sharp attacks on Amit Shah and PM Modi, thereby increasing the stature in national politics
 saath hi bhavishya main centre congress or baaki vipakshi dalon ke saath aane kii vakaalat karte hai, lekin ye kehete hue ki jahaan congress kamjor ho vahiin gathjod ho
 By the way, Digvijay knows that now Rahul is not the boss Sonia in the party
 isliye wo sonia- rahul kii tulana ko bemaani maanate hue rahul ko khuli chhot dene kii baat karte hai
 Finally, citing phulpur-gorakhpur, furthering Rahul's statement, Digvijay says that if the strategy is correct, Modi can be defeated in Benaras and BJP in the country
 kul milakar siyasat kii aakhri siries main digvijay nahin chal paae
 Therefore, by doing new homework and repairing the prick thorns of his politics, he is entering a new series of politics
 is baar wo flop hote hai yaa main of da siries banate hai iske najar rakhni hogi digvijay kii aage kii raajnneeti par

 Home Minister p Chidambaram on Friday became a victim of attack in both houses of Parliament for his alleged statement that if only the southern and western parts were in place, India would have progressed much more
 baari hangaame or narebaaji ke bich bhaajapa, sapa, rajd sahit kuch dalon ke sadasyon ne chidambaram kii barkhaastagi kii maang kii
 The uproar over the alleged statement of Chidambaram led to the adjournment of the Lok Sabha for 45 minutes and normal functioning could not take place later, which led to the adjournment of the House indefinitely
 donon hi sadanon main sadasyon ne chidambaram kii kathith tippanee par kadi aapatti jataayi
 It is reported that Chidambaram made the said remarks during a conversation with US Ambassador Timothy in 2009, which was revealed by wikileaks and published in the news daily Hindu
 nichle sadan main sapa pramukh mulaayam singh yadav ne yah mudda uthaate hue kaha ki chidambaram ne desh ke grih mantri hone ke baavjood rashtriya ekta ke khilaaf tippanee kii he
 He said that the most serious thing is that Chidambaram has said this to a foreign ambassador
 grahamantri ko barkhaast karne kii maang ko lekar unki party ke sadasyon ne narebaaji kii
 The SP leader said that it was extremely objectionable that Chidambaram made such remarks while holding the post of Home Minister
 narebaaji karte hue sapa saansad asana ke saamne aa gayi
 Mulayam said that Chidambaram's statement is shameful and should be removed immediately
 apane is bayaan ke liye chidambaram maafee bhi maangen
 BJP mps also supported SP members and attacked Chidambaram though Chidambaram was not present in the House at that time

 Raising the issue in the Rajya Sabha, Ram Gopal Yadav of the SP said that Chidambaram has insulted the country with his remarks
 isse desh kii ekta khatre main padati he
 They should withdraw their statement immediately

 The Modi government at the Center has expressed its defenses amidst the chaos over the Rafale deal and said that we have not misled the court, but the court misunderstood our argument

 The Center made it clear that it was not saying that the CAG report was tested by the PAC or that the edited portion was placed before Parliament
 usne spasht kiya ki note main kaha gaya he ki sarkaar kaig ke saath mulya vivaran ko saajha kar chuki he
 This sentence is written in the past tense and is "factually correct"
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki ukt note mote aksharon main likhaa gaya he 
 In it, the sentence written in bold letters says that the government has shared the price details with the CAG

 It said that the PAC was examining the CAG report

 According to the petition, in the note, it has been said from the Center that the PAC is examining the CAG report
 yah prakriya kii vyakhya he jo aam taur par apanaayi jaati he lekin faisle main angreji main ‘‘ij’’ yani ‘‘he’’ kii jagah ‘‘haij been’’ arthath ‘‘kar chuki he’’ kaa istemaal hua he
 The government has filed the petition at a time when the opposition Congress and others have questioned the issue and accused the government of misleading the apex court over the CAG report
 modi sarkaar ko badi raahat dete hue ucchtam nyaayalay ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki vah rafel ladaaku vimaan saude main nirnay lene kii prakriya se ‘‘santusht’’ he
 The apex court rejected the demand for an inquiry after which a round of accusations began between the BJP and the Congress over this decision

 The senior Congress leader told the media here that the government did not present the correct facts before the Supreme Court and lied in the court
 unhone kaha, 'sarkaar ne vahaan dikhaaya ki kaig rapat pesh kii gai he or piesi ne uski jaanch kii he
