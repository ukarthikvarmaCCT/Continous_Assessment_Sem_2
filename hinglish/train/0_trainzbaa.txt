 nehru ji ne sansad main kaha tha ki 370 ghiste-ghiste ghis jaaegi to hamane ghis daali
 What is new in this?

 It (article 370) was written as temporary
 kyon asthaayee likhaa

 NRC had brought Rajiv Gandhi on the issue of new citizenship law and National Citizenship Register (NRC) across the country, Amit Shah said on Tuesday that when NRC brought Rajiv Gandhi, it was secular, now Sonia Gandhi is opposing
 amit shah ne kaha, 'main spasht kar duun ki enarasi main dharm ke aadhaar par koi karrwai nahin hogi
 Whoever is not found to be a citizen of this country under NRC will be removed
 isliye enarasi sirf musalamaanon ke liye he yah kahana galat baat he
 He said, 'who brought the other thing NRC? i want to ask those who are protesting who brought it
 main congress adhyaksh or gulam nabi aaazaad se poochna chahta hum ki 1985 main jab assam samjhauta hua tab pehali baar enarasi kii baat sweekaar kii gai
 Then Clause 14 (a) was added to our Citizenship Act of 1955 on 3 December 2004

 At that time also the Congress was in government
 unke (congress) banaae kanoon par wo ham se hi sawaal kar rahe hai
 So did you make the law to put on a show case? If it did not seem necessary, then why did the law be made? 'after looking at the CAA and NRC, the question arises that what is the intention of the government? On this, Amit Shah said that do not look at this issue by associating it with the constituency
 ise thodaa peeche jaakar dekhnaa hoga
 First of all, the division of the country should not have been done on the basis of religion
 lekin yah katu satya he ki is desh kaa vibhaajan dharm ke aadhaar par hua
 Partition should never be on the basis of religion, but the Congress surrendered in the name of divided religion
 is desh kaa vibhaajan dharm ke aadhaar par hua
 Amit Shah said that the Congress divided the country on the basis of religion
 ye nahin hona chahie tha

 The Tata group has shown interest in buying a stake in debt-ridden Air India, news agency PTI reported quoting sources
 air india abhi sarkaar se mili package ke bal par chal rahi he
 This airline has been running at a loss for a long time and many suggestions are coming about it
 niti ayog ne to airline ke purna nijeekaran kaa suzav diya he
 However, the Civil Aviation Ministry has expressed concern over the proposal to privatize this national airline
 sarkaar ise phir se behatar sthiti main laane ke liye kai vikalpon par vichaar kar rahi he
 The government has not said anything about taking the Tata Group stake, but sources say the ministry is in favor of keeping Air India with itself
 tata group ke spoxperson ne ek email ke jawaab main kaha- ham aise maamalon par koi tippanee nahin karte
 The comments is puure ghatnakram kaa ek paridrishy banataa he ki 51 fisadi steke sarkaar apane paas rakhe or 49 fisadi nijee companiyon ko bech diya jaae jisamen videshi companiyaan bhi shaamil ho sakati hai
 Another option is to sell a minority stake in Air India and then deal with the airline's debt problem
 iske liye airline kii parisampattiyon ko bechaa ja saktaa he
 This is a 'homecoming' of sorts for the Tata group
 1932 main tata airlines ke naam se shuru kii gai is vimaanan company kaa baad main rashtriyakaran kar diya gaya tha
 Currently, the company has a debt of 52 thousand crores
 bataa den tata vistara or air asia india, donon ke saath sanyukt upkram main pehle se hi is kshetra main he

 a scenario of this whole development is that 51 percent of the stake should be retained by the government and 49 percent sold to private companies, which may also include foreign companies
 ek anya vikalp yah bhi he ki air india main alpaansh hissedari kii bikri kii jaae or uske baad airline ke karj kii samasya se nipta jaae
 For this, the assets of the airline can be sold
 tata group ke liye yah ek prakaar kii 'ghar vaapasi' he
 The airline, started in 1932 under the name of Tata Airlines, was later nationalized

 Azam Khan was interviewed by leading correspondent Piyush Babelle
 peedit pariwaron se milakar laute mantri ne mana ki raja bhaiya ko mantri bananaa badi galati thi
 He also said that Muslims are still seen as traitors in the country
 unhone sweekaar kiya ki pradesh main saal bhar main hue aparaadhon ke liye ve sharmasaar hai
 It has been a year for the SP government
 is dauraan aap log kya kar paae?darasal ham is ek saal ko tajurbe or imtahaan kaa saal kah sakate hai
 The government that has gone, has left an uncountable problem
 usase badi baat yah hui ki media se lekar netaaon tak kisi ko yah bharosa nahin tha ki samaajawaadee party itane bahumat se sarkaar bana legi
 He thought of himself as weak
 har choti-si baat, ek badi vajah bani hamaari badanaami kii
 No one can say good about those who have committed crime and those who have committed a crime
 lekin bispi sarkaar main dehshat kaa jo maahaul tha, ab vaisaa dehshat kaa maahaul nahin he
 But crime has increased in this one year as far as crime is concerned
 agar basapa sarkaar ke tareeke ko apanaaya gaya hota, ugaahi ke liye logon ke katl kiye jate, rishwat ke liye logon ke katl hue hote, to vah bahut sharmnaak suurate-haal hui hoti
 but that did not happen
 koi hidin hand aparaadhiyon ko uksaane kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 These crimes happened in our government, it is a shame for us
 is vakt pratapgarh ke is ek vaakye ko chhodkar koi aisa vakya nahin hua jab report loj nahin hui
 This was a big case
 hilited maamla tha
 There was the case of a minister
 ek sio kii hatya kaa maamla tha
 There is a case of killing a pradhan and his brother
 isamen bhi chaar main se teen aaropee jail main hai
 But what about fourth? Look, in this we are not justifying the absence of arrest
 chunki cese sibiai ko supurd kar diya gaya he
 He will have full rights and we are fully cooperating
 aise vyakti ko mantrimandal main laana kya jokhim bharaa kaam nahin tha?beshak raja bhaiya ko mantrimandal main laana jokhim kaa kaam tha
 Because he was taken into the cabinet and this incident happened
 hamaare paas apni safai main kehane ko kuch nahin he
 Looking back, Muslims became the target of many riots in a year? Will this not break the trust of Muslims from Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav? Do you understand that the government must have felt very happy
 in dangon main
 The government which has come to power with the support of the Muslims, with the support of the backward, with the support of the weak, that government will want to destroy itself by rioting and killing the Muslims
 aakhir ye bhi to sochie koun log hai iske peeche
 There can be two ways to stop those people
 ek to, jaisi karrwai dehshatgard karte hai, koi dictator karata he, waisi karrwai kii jaae
 There is no place for him in democracy
 sarkaar ne jo bhi karrwai kii kananu ke daayre main kii
 The rioters made a mission that we will defame this government
 to kya uttar pradesh sarkaar kanoon ke daayre main dangaiyon ko roak paane main aksham he?rokane kii koshish kar rahe hai, lekin koi bada fasaad na ho jaae, yah bhi dekhnaa he
 Because you know that this state has seen many dates like October 30, 1990 (firing day in Ayodhya) and December 6, 1992 (babri Masjid demolition)
 uskaa bada nuksaan kamajoro ko hi hua
 If the knife falls on the melon or the melon falls on the knife, the loss is due to the melon itself
 21 saal baad koi musalmaan pisies bana or vah bhi maar diya gaya
 How much harm has this caused to Muslim society? If a police officer of this level is murdered among us, then we have to think what is our future? This question is not just for any political party, it is for the whole society
 ham 1947 main pakistan nahin gaye, upi se koi pakistan gaya nahin he
 Jinnah Sahib's Pakistani slogan failed
 pakistan gaye dedh fisadi logon kii sajaa saadhe 98 fisadi ko di jaaegi? kya hamaare saath insaaf hoga? moulana aaazaad the hamaare numaayinde, jinna nahin the
 If the country is not divided, there is no hatred of the name of partition and what is happening with us today does not happen
 sabase zyada lujar ham hai, nuksaan to sirf hamaara hua he
 If divided, they are called traitors in their own country
 kitna bhi dil nikaalkar de den, yahi kaha jayega ki ab de rahe ho jab dhadak nahin rahaa he
 We went to life and gave him heart, he did not appreciate
 kya aap yah kahana chaah rahe hai, ki musalamaanon se sautela vyavhaar hota he?sautela to nahin, lekin samajhane main galati hui
 The day it will be understood that the right to Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav belong to Atal Bihari Vajpayee Saheb in India, the same rights belong to Muslims, then all the issues will end themselves
 sapa ne vaada kiya tha ki aatankwaad ke aarope main band begunaahon ko reeha karaayaa jayega
 Why this promise could not be implemented much? One of the main accused in terrorism is arrested
 uske baad ek-duusare se jude logon kii giraftaar hoti he
 In these other types of arrests, the police presented their report in the innocence
 bahut hilited keson main bhi tarika to yahi hoga
 The police will give their report, now the decision is with the court
 isamen hamaara koi dakhal nahin he
 Is there a need for sensitive police? Those who accuse Muslims of being terrorists
 jo log yah kehete hai ki har musalmaan aatankwaadi nahin he, lekin har aatankwaadi musalmaan he
 He forgets about "abhinav Bharat"
 or vah ye bhul jate hai ki jab dilli kii sadakon par samuhik balaatkaar ke maamle ko lekar saare hindustan ke noujvaan panjon par khadey ho jate hai or sarkaar se ek majboot kanoon kii maang karte hai
 When the central government starts to think that there is no revolution like Tahrir Chowk
 tabhi sarhadon par achaanak do sir utar jate hai
 And on the next day there is no case and the matter is over
 ye sawaal jo aapane uthaaya to kya ye sawaal aapaki party ko sansad main nahin uthaanaa chahie tha?main is par kuch kah nahin saktaa
 But tell me why did your Netaji raise the issue of joining the BJP conditionally in Parliament? Is there scope for relationship with BJP? There is no question of scope for BJP
 na aisa hamaara itihaas he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party had to realize, our leader, he had to show to the whole country that these people and these people have no goods except hatred
 inhen kitna bhi pukaaro ye andhe hai, ye bahere hai, ye bina pairon ke hai, inke haath nahin hai
 He was fascist and will remain fascist
 kya aapako nahin lagata ki modi ke mishan 2014 se muslim congress kii taraf ja sakate hai?pichhali baar sapa ko nuksaan congress kii vajah se nahin hua tha, pichhali baar musalmaan kanphyus ho gaya tha kisi khaas vajah se
 
 yani aap us samay party main nahin the isliye muslim kanphyus hue?ye sab kehane kaa vakt nahin he
 There will be great bitterness of the matter
 lekin musalmaan kanfooj ho gaya tha
 What is in your box for Muslims? i am working on a special charter for Muslims
 jald hi netaji se milakar ise antim rup duungaa
 You should understand that there will be a solid system of education and employment of Muslims
 jaise koi ejeeniyar he to use itani madad mil sake ki vah apana rojgaar shuru kar sake
 We will end the system that produces misteries

 haryana or maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav (maharashtra, Haryana Election Results 2019) ke parinaamon main kaaphi uthal puthal dekhne ko mil rahi he
 While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has secured a majority in the trends in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, the BJP is still trailing by a majority in Haryana
 isi vajah se ab bijepi janata jananaayak party (JJP) se sampark kar rahi he or kingmekar ke rup main jejepi netaa dushyant chautaala ubharkar saamne aa rahe hai
 On the other hand, BJP state presidents of Maharashtra and Haryana are trailing in the trends
 maharashtra bijepi adhyaksh chandrakant patil (chandrakant Patil) kothrud vidhansabha seat or haryana bijepi adhyaksh subhash baraala (subhash Barala) tohana vidhansabha seat par peeche chal rahe hai
 It is being said that the career of both BJP presidents in both states is at stake
 kothrud seat kii baat karen to bijepi kaa sabase surakshit seat kehalaata he
 This is because it is an urban area and has a BJP vote bank here
 kothrud seat ke liye chandrakant patil ko pashchim maharashtra se shift karakar laae the
 Chandrakant is called Maratha Face
 chandrakant patil kii manase party ke ummidavaar kishor naanaa scindia se haarane kii sambhaavna bani hui he

 At the same time, the dream of winning more than 75 seats in Haryana is not fulfilled

 Pakistan considers the objectionable remarks made by Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi against Home Secretary GK Pillai as an 'attempt to divert attention' from the issue of terrorism
 bharat kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki kuraishi ko sambhavat: pakistan ke un tatwon ne aisa karne ke liye baadhya kiya hoga, jo donon deshon ke bich baatcheet baadhit karnaa chaahate hai
 Government sources said that Pakistani elements seeking hostility with India were upset over the successful conclusion of India's Home Minister and Home Secretary level talks with Pakistan last month
 unke dabaav main hi sambhavat: kuraishi ne yah bayaan diya he
 Sources said that Home Minister level talks with Pakistan were so good that Home Minister Rehman Malik told Home Minister p Chidambaram that next time Pakistan will answer India's questions related to terrorism, India should not despair
 Will look
 unhone kaha ki pakistan ke baatcheet nahin chaahane vaale tatv grih sachiv or grih mantri ke str par hui dwipaksheeya baatcheet ko hi vifal karne kii koshish karnaa chaahate the lekin ab unhone videsh mantri str kii vaarta main aisa kar daalaa
 Qureshi compared Pillai with Foreign Minister SM Krishna in a joint press conference in Islamabad on Thursday with Hafiz Saeed, the Jamaat-ud Dawa chief and the Mumbai attack plotter, saying that Home Secretary Pillai was carrying out negative propaganda
 kuraishi ne kaha, ‚Äòlekin main jaananaa chahta hum ki is vaarta kii purvasandhya par bhartiya grih sachiv dwaara diya gaya bayaan kis had tak madadgaar sabit hoga
 Both of us (ministers) believe that it was not needed
 ‚Äôsutron ne kaha ki kureshi kaa yah bayaan pakistan dwaara aatankwaad se dhyaan bantane kaa prayaas he kyonki vah bharat kii ore se uthaaye gayi ghuspaith jaise muddon par ab tak koi karrwai nahin kar paaya he
 Pillai had earlier this week accused Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI of having played an alleged role in controlling and coordinating the Mumbai terror attack from beginning to end
 sutron ne kaha ki pakistan ko mumbai aatanki hamale ke aaropee david hedli ke bhartiya jaanch agenciyon ke samaksh diye gayi bayaan se judy kuch soochna di gayi or usase kaha gaya ki vah yadi adhik gopneey jaankaree chahta he to use america kanoon vibhaag or epabiai se sampark karnaa chahie
 He said that Headley has admitted in a statement before the Indian authorities that the ISI had allegedly helped the terrorists in the Mumbai terror attack and a full briefing was given by the ISI to the perpetrators of the attack
 sutron ke mutabik haal ke dinon main seemaa paar se ghuspaith kii ghatnaon main bhi badhottaree hui he
 Stopping infiltration is not only the responsibility of India but also of Pakistan
 ‚Äô unhone kaha ki adarsh rup se bharat pakistan ke saath naye sire se sambandh sthapit karnaa chahta he lekin iske liye kadam dar kadam aage badhanaa hoga or vishwaas behaal karnaa hoga
 According to sources, the selective approach in dealing with terrorists will not work and Pakistan does not approve of taking action against the Taliban of Afghanistan and not taking action against the Taliban of Pakistan
 yah bhi nahin ho saktaa ki vah lashkar e tayba par karrwai na kare or kisi anya aatanki sanghathan par karrwai kare
 He should deal with every terrorist in the same manner
 intervyuu ke dauraan aksar aisa hota he ki ham aasaan sawaalon jawaab dete samay kuch maamuli galtiyaan kar baithte he, jiske vajah se ek acchhee naukari haath se chali jaati he
 If you are looking for a new job and are going to interview, then answer this way
 
 
 jaane intervyuu ke dauraan kaisaa ho aapkaa jawaab
 
 
 Tell something about yourself? Usually in interview, this question is asked first of all to tell something about yourself
 iske liye kuch taiyaari kar len
 It should not be that you are repeating things
 koshish karen ki jo kaam aap jaanate hai usee ke bare main bataaen
 Keep in mind that you should focus more on those things and work, for which position (work) you have gone to take a job
 pehle se kiye kaamon ko bataate hue vartmaan main jo kaam aap kar rahe hai unhen bataate hue baat khatm karen
 Do not exaggerate yourself
 pichhali naukari kyon chodi?aise prashnon kaa sakaaratmak jawaab den
 If there is any problem in that job, do not mention it at all
 jo bhi bataaen use hansmukh hokar bataaen or sakaaratmak mode par laakar baat khatm karen
 It did not even say by mistake that the previous office environment was not good, holidays were not available, work pressure was high
 revijan ke saath in baton kaa rakhen dhyaan, pariksha main aaenge achche marxkitne saal kaam kaa anubhav?jis pad ke liye aap intervyuu dene ja rahe hai usase sambandhit puraane anubhavon ke bare main bataaen
 If there is no experience related to the post, mention the works related to it
 apane aap ko zyada ekperions dikhaane ke liye apana kaamon kaa gun gane kii jarurat nahin he
 Doing so can create a negative impression
 hamaare santhaan ke bare main kya jaanate hai?intervyuu se ek din pehle company ke bare main research karke jaaen
 For example, what kind of work does the company (institution) you want to go to, who is its competitor in the market, what is the attitude of the institute in the market
 santhaan ko or aage le jane main aap kis tarah kii bhoomika nibhaayenge
 What are those things that you know whose experience can make the company better
 kyon judana chaahate hai?ye ek ahm sawaal he
 Answer this question thoughtfully in view of the information collected about the company
 jawaab main sachai hona jaruri he, nahin to aapaki juthi baat yahaan turant pakad main aa jaaegi
 Want to change jobs, or increase income
 aisa jawaab dekar apane pair par kulhadi maarane kii koshish naa karen
 Present it in such a way that you may have come to join this institute for a long time
 iskaa sawaal kaa jawaab ekadam sateek or sakaaratmak den
 TIPS: If you are on the heights of success, do not you think about this work? The interviewer will not want to hear a long answer
 kya aap nishchit taur par yahi naukari paanaa chaahate hai? agar haa
 So the better answer for such questions is that i will do better work for the institute as much as possible
 main yahaan ritred hone tak kaam karnaa chaahunga, basharte ki company ko meri jarurat ho
 Why should the institute take you? You tell them that the work that you need is needed in the institute and you can share your experience with the institute and take the institute to the path of success
 jab aap anubhav kii baat karen to kisi duusare aavedak se tulana naa karen
 If possible, the ideas that advance the institute can be kept
 aapkaa sabase majboot paksh kya he?jawaab kai ho sakate hai lekin sakaaratmak jawaab hi den
 Your ability to work, skill to overcome problems, ability to work under pressure, professional experience, leadership skills and positive attitude
 kitni selary kii ummid?yah prashn poocha hi jaataa he
 It has to be answered very cleverly
 isliye pehle iskaa jawaab naa den or kahen ki haalanki yah bahut mushkil jawaab he, acha hoga aap mujhe kitna dene ke icchhuk hai
 In many cases, the interviewer says that he will tell you later
 aise main kahen- thik he, kaam ko dekhte hue mujhe thik selary kii ummid he

 kalbe jawaad ne maang kii he ki madrason par sawaal uthaane or madrasa shiksha khatm karne kii maang ke baad ab rizvi ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kii jaani chahie
 Kalbe Jawad said that Shia Central Waqf Board Chairman Wasim Rizvi has made baseless and baseless allegations on madrasa education
 unhone madrason ko aatank se jodakar bada paap kiya he, isliye maafee nahin di ja sakati
 Jawad said jointly condemning the baseless statement made by Shia Waqf Board Chairman Wasim Rizvi for Madrasas, all ulema of India demanded Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's arrest of Wasim Rizvi
 shiya dharm guru ne upi sarkaar se sawaal kiya ki aakhir sarkaar dwaara wasim rizvi ko chhot die jane kaa kaaran kya he? abhi tak uske khilaaf lambit sibiai jaanch kyon nahin karai gai or na police dwaara chargeshit daakhil kii ja rahi he

 shiyamoulanane kaha ki agar mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ko bhi chunauti di
 He said that if the government does not take strong action against Wasim Rizvi, then we will be forced to protest from Lucknow to Delhi
 moulana ne kaha ki 5 saal ke liye madrase ajam khan ke paas rahe hai, jiskaa matlab he ki ajam khan ke samay se aatankwaadi banaaye ja rahe hai
 The chairman has also remained silent for five years, which means that he is also involved in the crime of making terrorists
 moulana ne shiya madrason ke jimmedaaron se bhi kaha ki vah is maamle par kyon chupp hai
 Rizvi has targeted madrassas and accused them of making terrorists
 isliye shiya madrason ke jimmedaar uske khilaaf karrwai kii maang karen
 Kalbe Jawad said that Wasim Rizvi is making such baseless and inflammatory statements to gain his interests and avoid arrest, but now such statements cannot be tolerated
 kalbe jawaad ne pradhanmantri narendra modi or mukhyamantri yogi adityanath se maang kii he ki wasim rizvi ke niraadhaar aaropon ke khilaaf karrwai kii jaae or use giraftaar kiya jaye

 On stopping the Prime Minister's address during Azan, Azam Khan said, 'it is not appeasement, fear of Allah, because of all the things he has done here, there are many things that could have happened in any Islamic state
 'iske saath hi unhone notebandi or 'goshabandi' ko lekar bhi piem par nishaanaa saadhaa

 lokapal kii niyukti na hone par naaraazgi jaahir karte hue supreme court ne centre sarkaar ko kadi fatkaar lagaai he
 The court said that since 2014, why the appointment of Lokpal has not been done so far
 court ne sarkaar se poocha ki aakhir ab tak lokapal kanoon main sanshodhan kyon nahin kiya gaya he ? kyon sarkaar sanshodhan karne se apane kadam kyon peeche khinch rahi he ?mukhya nyaayadhish ne tippanee karte hue kaha is sarkaar ko bane dhai saal ho chuke hai, jab tak ye sarkaar he koi bhi netaa pratipaksh nahin ban saktaa to kya is vajah se lokapal kii niyukti ataki rahegi ?? ham aisa kaise hone de sakate hai ki lokapal jaisi sanstha kaa koi matlab hi na ho
 Commenting on the petition filed by Prashant Bhushan's body, the Supreme Court said that Parliament passed the Lokpal Act in January 2014 but the Lokpal has not been appointed yet
 sanshodhan act sansad main lambitasarkaar ne kaha kanoon ke mutabik lokapal kii chayan cameti main vipaksh kaa netaa hona jaruri hai, lekin durbhaagya se abhi sansad main koi vipaksh kaa netaa hi nahi hai, lokapal act main sanshodhan kaa wo bill abhi sansad main lambit hai jiske jariye sabase badi vipakshi party ke netaa ko bhi lokapal chayan cameti kaa sadsy banaaya ja sake
 Cannot disrespect the mandate The Supreme Court questioned why the government is holding back from passing this amendment, the Lokpal law has been brought after much struggle and the government cannot disrespect the mandate by negligence
 court ne sanket die ki sarkaar kaa lachar ravaiya rahane par wo aadesh paas kar saktaa hai jiske jariye sabase badi vipakshi party ke netaa ko lokapal chayan cameti kaa sadsy niyukt kiya jaye
 Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi argued in the court that the Supreme Court does not have the right to act in Parliament and make laws
 sansad ko kis tarah chalanaa chahie yah bataane kaa adhikaar supreme court ke paas nahin he
 Rohatgi said how the Supreme Court can believe that Parliament is not serious about the amendment bill

 The story of some of the other actresses is not much different, even if they have allegedly crossed the hiccups of the casting couch and become the beloved of Telugu audiences
 tollywood mahilaon kaa shoshan karne vaale nirmaataa-nirdeshkon ke liye badnaam he lekin vahaan pratispardhaa bhi tagdi he jisase nikal kar aage baduya hota he
 Apart from this, only one out of every five Telugu heroines are successful due to the bias towards the clean and white color of the manufacturers
 unka maananaa he ki telegu darshakon ko sthaneey ladakiyon ke mukaable bahari ladkiyaan zyada pasand aati hai
 However, the big money makers believe that "local Telugu girls dance in dance, wearing bikini and kissing scenes
" '' telegu heroin anjali ko pehali baar mauka dene vaale film diarector nageshwar raav kehete hai, ''zyaadaatar telegu ladkiyaan filmi kariyar kii khwaahish nahin rakhti hai
 Whatever comes, they do not have the aggression to compete and they do not interest the audience because they are reluctant to romance or dance openly like their competitors in other films
 ''nirmaataa-nirdeshak tammaa reddy bharadwaj bataate hai, ''shahari telegu ladakiyon kaa rujhaan or ravaiya zyaadaatar maamalon main feet nahin baithta he
 "she is also hesitant to mail her photos or come for auditions
" ve kehete hai, ''har duusare din mere mail par mumbai kii ladakiyon ke sivi or tasviren aa jaati hai
 Recently, a Thai girl sent me a mail expressing her desire to work in a Telugu film
 ''isliye pratibhasampann telegu abhinetriyaan swati, madhu shalini or bindu madhavi vagairah tamil or malayalam filmon kii peshkash par hi zyada bharosa karti hai
 But the more popular actresses are those who do not know Telugu and who dominate
 ve purush abhinaytaon ke saath kadam milaane ke liye bahut jaldi se dialog delivery sikhti hai jinke ird-gird kahani gumti he
 Legendary producer-director-actor Dasari Narayan Rao complains, "many young heroines feel that they will spend a few years in Telugu cinema on the basis of their beauty
" ''abhinetriyon ke liye telegu cinema duusare dakshin bhartiya film bazaaron‚Äîtamil, malayalam or kannada‚Äîse zyada aakarshak he kyonki iskaa bharat or america main bada bazaar he jisase heroinon kii kamai zyada ho jaati he or kai maamalon main to unhen hindi filmon se bhi zyada paise mil jate hai
 The Telugu industry tries to produce at least two films in a week, which are not necessarily released, by this scale, it even surpasses Bollywood at times
 kai bade bajet kii filmein bhi nikalati hai, unamem kuch bahubhashi bhi hai jaise 10 july ko relies hone vaali bahubali 135 karod ru
 May be the most expensive film made with a production cost of Rs
 yah hindi, tamil or malayalam main bhi relies ho rahi he
 However all established manufacturers gamble to invest in other businesses as well
 zyaadaatar real estate, soochna praudyogiki or yahaan tak ki kheti-kisaani main bhi paisa lagaakar telegu cinema ko bahuaiami udyog bana dete hai
 Of the manufacturer
 el
 Damodar Prasad says, "new producers make at least two Telugu films out of every five who do not even try to understand the nuances of this film industry
" ''paise ke maamle main sitare hameshaa phaayde main rahete hai
 Successful actresses like Anushka Reddy, Samantha Ruth Prabhu, Kajal Aggarwal, Tamannaah Bhatia and Nayantara were paid Rs 1 crore for a film produced by a producer
 se zyada adaa karte hai
 At the same time, there are also heroines like Rakul Preet Singh, Anjali, Nitya Menon and Regina Kasandra, which cost Rs 50-80 lakh
 tak kamaati hai
 Usually, actresses ask for more money after seeing a short career, because many heroes do not want to land with them in more than two-three films
 haal ke daur main dashak bhar se zyada kaamyaab kariyar vaali kannada mul kii saundarya jaisi kuch hi heroine thim
 Soundarya was killed in a helicopter crash in the 2004 election campaign
 unke alaava tamil mul kii ramya krishna, punjabi simran or idhar kuch samay se trisha hi safal hai
 Trisha is also Tamil and also does Tamil films
 isliye tollywood main abhinetriyon kaa ek hi mantra he, jab tak chamak he, jitna ho sake, bator lo

 donald trump ne twit kiya, das saal tak search karne ke baad, mumbai aatanki hamalon kaa tathakthith mastermind ko pakistan main giraftaar kar liya gaya
 There was a lot of pressure in the last two years to find him
 raashtrapati donald trump kahana chaahate hai ki hafiz said kii giraftaar america ke baari dabaav ke chalate hui he
 Earlier, the perpetrator of Mumbai attack and global terrorist Hafiz Saeed was arrested in Pakistan

 After running a 'sweep' on BJP and Congress in Delhi Assembly elections, now it is the turn of Ramlila Maidan
 jaise hi arvind kejariwal ne 14 farvari ko is maidan main shapath lene kaa elaan kiya, puraa sarkari amala ramlila maidan ko lekar jute gaya
 What police, what MCD - all got ready
 dilli sarkaar ke pramukh sachiv anando majumdaar ne bataaya ki puri taiyaari ho rahi he or har taraf dhyaan diya ja rahaa he
 It is being specially taken care of that there will be a lot of crowd at the time of swearing, so in the same way all the departments are meeting and preparing for it
 mana ja rahaa he ki is baar kaa shapath grahan behad khaas hoga, or ek lakh logon kii kshamta vaala ramlila maidan logon kii bheed ke chalate chota pad jayega, lihaaja baahar screen lagane kii yojana bhi he
 Apart from this, since the Aam Aadmi Party has also invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his cabinet ministers for the swearing-in ceremony, government officials are working on this issue too
 unki koshish he ki aane waalon ko dikkat na ho, jabaki dilli police yah tay karne main juty he ki ramlila maidan kaa suraksha gheraa kaise banaaya jaae
 By the way, there is also a road show of Arvind Kejriwal to be held before the swearing-in ceremony in front of the police, so during that time, the traffic police is also preparing its roadmap for the people to face any kind of problem
 aam aadmi party main kumaar vishwaas ko lekar phir siyasat tej ho gai he
 Two big party leaders Dilip Pandey and then Deepak Vajpayee questioned Kumar Vishwas, on Friday, a poster was found near the office of the Aam Aadmi Party demanding that Kumar Vishwas be dismissed from the party, saying he was a friend of the BJP
 
 haalanki, party ise vipaksh kii sajeesh bataa rahi he
 Two incidents between Kejriwal Amanatullah in close days are indicating that everything is not right about Kumar Vishwas
 kumaar vishwaas ke khilaaf bayaan dene vaale vidhayak amanatulla khan ke ghar iftaar party main siem kejariwal shaamil bhi hue or saath main tasviren bhi khinchvaai
 Apart from this, party leader Dilip Pandey questioned that Kumar Vishwas speaks against the Congress but why not speak for BJP leaders? Earlier, even after a crushing defeat in the MCD elections, Kumar Vishwas was confronted
 party vidhayak amanatulla ne aarope lagaaya tha ki bijepi ke ishaare par kumaar vishwaas vidhayakon ko todane main lage hai
 However, Kejriwal managed to hold the controversy then
 phir kapil mishra baagi ho gaye or kejariwal par tabadatod aarope lagaate aa rahe hai
 Kapil Mishra has been described as the Kumar Vishwas camp
 AAP main baghawat kaa itihaas2011 main india against karpshan se anna hajaare ke netritv main hue jan lokapal andolan se lim lite main aae arvind kejariwal ne apane kuch sahyogiyon ke saath 26 november 2012 main aap party kaa gathan kiya tha

 Several founding members of the party are among the leaders who have left Kejriwal
 daalate hai party main baghawat ke itihaas par ek najar
 Kapil Mishra After the MCD election, Kejriwal removed his close minister Kapil Mishra from the post of minister
 iske baad kapil mishra ne kejariwal par satyendra jain se do karod rupee lene kaa aarope laga diya
 Since then Kapil Mishra has been continuously accusing Kejriwal of making revelations
 yogendra yadav, prashanth bhooshkanna andolan se lekar aam aadmi party banane tak kejariwal ke saath rahane vaale mashhoor vakil prashanth bhushan bhrashtachar ke khilaaf maahaul banane main ahm bhoomika nibhaa rahe the

 Because of this he was expelled from the party

 Mayank Gandhi wrote an article on his blog after the expulsion of Mayanki Gandhi Yogendra Yadav, Prashant Bhushan and others
 lekh main unhone kejariwal par kai aarope lagaae
 He resigned a few days later
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke khilaaf soshal media par aapattijanak post saajha karne ko lekar ek patrkaar ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya gaya he
 a police officer said on Saturday that an FIR was lodged against journalist Prashant Kanaujia at Hazratganj police station on Friday night by a sub-inspector
 isamen aarope lagaaya gaya he ki aaropee ne mukhyamantri ke khilaaf aapattijanak tippanee kii or unki chhavi dhoomil karne kaa prayaas kiya
 a senior police official said that the police is about to interrogate the accused journalist soon
 bataa den ki aaropee patrakaarkanojia ne ek video tivetor or fasebuk par share kiya tha, jisamen ek mahila mukhyamantri karyaalay ke baahar vibhinn media sanghathanon ke samvaadadaataaon se baat karti dikh rahi he
 The woman is claiming that she has sent the marriage proposal to the Chief Minister
 kanaujia ke tivetor handle par likhaa he ki vah iiemasi or mumbai vishvavidhyalay ke chaatr rah chuke hai or kuch media sanghathanon se jude hai
 (from input language) vakt badla, takneekee badali, tarika badla to kaagaj kaa rupaya bhi plastic mani main badal gaya
 Speaking of plastic money, if you have that small card, then there is no need to keep money in your pocket
 bas chalate-chalate kisi bhi atm par jaaie or jarurat ke hisaab se paise nikaal lijie
 There are about one lakh 80 thousand such atms in this country and 25 thousand crore rupees are put into those atms daily and withdrawn
 par atm tak ye hajaaron karod rupye kaise pahunchate hai? inaki suraksha ke kya intjaam hote hai? pichley hafte dilli mensaade22 karod rupye kii luutake baad ye sawaal achaanak bada ho gaya he
 a few stories of loot
 
 
 02 agast 2013 ko uttar purvi dilli ke maansarovar ilaake main hameshaa kii tarah ek cash-vine atm main rupye daalane pahunchi thi lekin isse pehle ki rupye daal kar vine aage badhati achaanak hi teen hathiyaarband badmaashon ne vine ko gher liya or gan point par 37 lakh 50 hajaar rupye lut liye din dahaade hui isvaardaatne sabko chaunkaa diya
 Many years have passed since this incident, but the robbers have no clue
 29 november 2014 ko bheed bhare kamala nagar bazaar main jindagi apni raftaar par thi
 Then suddenly people were shocked by the sound of gunfire
 lekin isse pehle ki log kuch samaj pate, bazaar ke bichon-bich lage ek atm main cash bharne ke dauraan security guard kaa katl kar badmaash dedh karod rupye lekar rafuchakkar ho gaye
 Neither one could see the face of the miscreants nor could identify the number of the car
 alabatta paas hi lagesisitivi cameremen badmaashon kii tasviren jarur kaid ho gayi
 But this matter is still unresolved
 26 november 2015 ko govindpuri ilaake main esas security agency kii ek cash vine saadhe 22 karod rupye lekar pashchimi dilli ke vikaspuri se okhla ke liye chali thi, lekin shrinivasapuri se govindpuri ke bich hi driver sari kii sari rakam lekar gaayab ho gaya
 This was the latest and biggest incident of such loot in Delhi
 chunki maamla bada tha, police ne sari takat jhonk di or agle din suraj nikalne se pehle hi vine kaa driver puure cash ke saath pakad liya gaya
 Bank incidents also decreased; some stories are only from Delhi
 desh bhar main aisi vaardaaton kii fehrist kahin bahut lambii he
 But on the pretext of these incidents, the security of atms in all parts of the country, including Delhi, and the methods of putting money in them have once again come into question
 sawaal khadey ho gaye hai ki aakhir atm main rupye daalane ke kaayade-kanoon kya hai or kya is kaam main lagisecurity agenciyanor police uske hisaab se chalati he yaa phir nahin? kyonki ye maamla sirf rupayon kii lut yaa amaanat main khyaanat kaa nahin he, balki aisi hi lut kii vaardaaton main ab tak desh main saikadon log apni jaan se haath dho baithe hai
 We all go to an ATM at least once every week
 jaahir he, atm ne qatari main khadey ho kar bank se rupye nikaalane ke jhamele se bhi sabko aaazaad kar diya he, saath hi aise transiction ke dauraan main bank main hone vaali gunaah kii vaardaaton main bhi kami ai he
 How much money is paid every day? Do you know that there are 10,000 atms in Delhi alone, in which crores of rupees are poured and withdrawn daily
 jabaki desh bhar main atm kaa aankada kul 1 lakh 80 hajaar ho jaataa he
 Now, when there is a transaction of crores of rupees daily from such atms, then there is a question about their safety
 lekin is sawaal kaa jawaab behad chaunkaanewaala he
 The money of your hard earned money is lost when it comes to billions of rupees beyond the thousand, ten thousand, lakh, ten lakh, crore, ten crore, then such an arrangement is made
 ye tasviren hai dilli ke aise hi privet chest kii, jahaan se har roj arabon rupye kaa transiction hota he
 Yes, billions of rupees and these rupees are neither of any mint nor of any rich sultan, but it is that part of your and our hard earned money, which reaches the pocket of all of us through this chest
 darasal, dilli main cash vine se hue saadhe 22 karod rupye kii lut kii vaardaat ne agar dilli police ke haath-paanv phula die, to bank se atm tak rupye pahunchane ke puure taur-tareeke par bhi sawaal khadey kar die or rupayon kii hifaajat ke saath-saath logon kii jindagi se jude aise hi sawaalon ke jawaab jaanane ke liye ham ja pahunche usee company main, jiske cash vine se amaanat main khyanat kii ye vaardaat hui thi or jiske hajaaron cash vine ke paas har roj puri dilli main karodon rupye idhar se udhar karne kii badi jimmedaari he
 Now let us understand the role of such security agencies in broad money transfusion to understand this matter
 security companiyon ko outsource karte hai bankebank main jo rupye jamaa hote hai, tamaam hisaab-kitaab ke baad bank unheen rupayon ko etiemon main bharne ke liye bhejtaa he
 But this work is not done by the bank itself
 balki suraksha sambandhi baton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue aise hi security companiyon ko outsource karata he
 And these companies do everything from collecting rupees from bank to keeping them in their safety and filling them in different atms
 guuruuvaar ko bhi esas company kii jis cash vine ko lekar driver bhaag niklaa tha, wo cash vine kuch aise hi exis bank ke chest se rupye lekar use okhla vaale daftar main le kar ja rahi thi, jinhen aage alag-alag atm centre tak pahunchaaya janaa tha
 But in the meantime, the game took place on the way ye or baat he ki tamaam rupye insurd the
 This entire system of collecting money from banks and sending them to different ATM centers is very big and important in itself
 dilli main hi das hajaar atiemdilli samet puure desh main lage etiemon kii taadaad or usamen bhare jane vaale rupayon ke hisaab se iskaa pataa lagata he
 According to the current figures, Delhi alone has ten thousand atms in the country's capital
 jabaki puure desh main alag-alag bainkon ke lagbhag ek lakh assi hajaar atm lage hai
 With the help of such security agencies, banks across the country put around Rs 25,000 crore into atms every day
 desh bhar main alag-alag suraksha agenciyaan ye kaam 8 hajaar jeepies monitard cash-vine kii madad se karti hai
 But the most shocking aspect of this whole system is that no rule law has been enacted by the government for such sensitive work till date
 yani sabakuch bhagwaan bharose chal rahaa he
 Hundreds of people are killed every year, including the country's capital Delhi, if hundreds of people are killed every year in different cities in the guise of looting similar rupees, but despite all this, God is still going on
 dilli main guuruuvaar ko hui saadhe 22 karod rupye kii lut kii vaardaat ke baad is maamle keepadtaal ke dauraankuch aisi hi chaunkaane vaali baaten saamne ai
 It became clear that the police do ensure that the security agencies run certain laws from time to time, but there are no clear guidelines on paper for this
 aise main kuch niyam kanoon aise hai, jinhen khud bainkon ne apane rupayon kii hifaajat ke liye bana rakhe hai, jabaki kuch police or suraksha agenciyon ne yani sabase gambhir vishay par hi milijuli sarkaar chal rahi he
 The most serious subject is untouched by the ignorance of the rules
 According to these unannounced rules, usually the banks have made a rule not to carry more than 1 crore rupees in a cash van
 jabaki police ne tamaam bank or agencys ko bank or chest ke alaava gadiyon main sisitivi camere or jeepies lagane kii hidaayat de rakhi he
 The police have also said to take two gunmen along with the amount of more than one crore rupees
 jabaki haivi transiction ke dauraan local police ko ittila dene kii baat bhi kahi gai he
 But since there is nothing clearly on paper in these rule laws and the case of punishment for violation is also not clear

 In some areas of Delhi, crores of crores are being done by declaring government land as private and all this is happening with the devotion of some leaders of administration and Congress
 taaja kissa dilli ke gokulpuri ilaake kaa he, jahaan land shark bane property dealron ne ek shaks ko 4 karod 40 lakh rupee main sarkari jameen bech di

 peshey se gudgaanv kii ek privet limited company main diarector waike sharma dilli ke gokulpuri ilaake main rahete hai
 Sharma's wife's dream was to open a school, to which she signed a 300-square-yard deal with a property firm in Gokulpuri
 sauda karne vaale log sthaneey property dealer the or kuch congress ke sthaneey netaa bhi
 The land deal was finalized for 40 million rupees
 40 lakh unhone peshgi di or baaki rakam lone paas hone ke baad dena tay hua
 The truth of the land was revealed when Sharma applied for a bank loan
 naa to jameen ke maalik kaa pataa tha or naa hi jameen se judaa ek bhi kaagaj asli
 When Sharma asked questions through RTI, it came to know that the land is of Gram Sabha, which cannot be sold
 police se lekar netaa or prashasan tak puure system se harkar sharma ne court main arji lagaai or court ne naa sirf police ko do sthaneey congress netaa surendra sharma or satish upaadhyaay samet 7 logon ke khilaaf exiaar darj karne ke nirdesh die balki maamle main shaamil sarkari adhikariyon ke khilaaf bhi karrwai karne kaa nirdesh die
 The documents present with Yogendra Sharma make it clear that in this brokerage of land, from Patwari to Tehsildar and from Police to Leader all are black in the brokerage of the property
 jo ye bhi saaf karte hai ki jameen ke dalal puure system ko hi bhrasht kar chuke hai

 What Yogendra Sharma has experienced in the last 7 months can happen to any Delhiite

 Tata Motors' small car Nano has reached a stage where the company will have to take a big decision about it
 tata group ke purv chairman ratan tata kii duniya kii sabase sasti car banane kii yojana ke tahat nirmit is car ne khub tahalaka machaaya, lekin bikri ke maamle main yah koi chamatkaar nahin kar pai or ab iske astitv par hi sawaal uthne lage hai

 The name of the cheap car got customers away from it, because people in this country buy cars to show their status
 yahaan kaaron se logon kaa sammaan judaa hua he
 They do not want their neighbors to see their cheap cars
 unhone kaha ki naino ko ek chip car ke rup main sthapit karnaa ek galati thi
 Ratan Tata had expressed the hope that everyone would buy it by making this car at a price of Rs one lakh
 is car kii sari duniya main ejineering ke udhaaharan ke rup main prashansa hui, lekin yah kabhi ummiido par khari nahin utari or ab isaki ausatan bikri 2,500 prati maah par ja pahunchi he
 For this, the company set up such a large plant in Anand in Gujarat
 isi car ke plant ke liye zamin dekar narendra modi ne desh ke bade kaarobaariyon main apana sikaa jamaaya
 But now making just 2500 cars every month in such a large plant is hurting the company
 aankade bataa rahe hai ki june, july or agast main maheenon main har maheene lagbhag 2,000 naino kaaren bikin
 The company made all efforts to sell this car
 iji finance kii suvidha bhi di lekin is car kii bikri nahin badi
 The company hoped that this car would sell more in small towns and villages, because people would go beyond motorcycles and scooters to buy small cars, but this car did not sell there
 ulte shaharon main logon ne ise duusari car ke rup main apana liya
 That is, someone who already had a car, bought this car as an amateur
 company ne oktober maheene main naino kaa sienji vairient bhi pesh kiya, jisaki keemat is naino se 35,000 rupee zyada thi, lekin yah car bhi koi khaas jalawaa nahin dikhaa paa rahi he
 Now the company is preparing to introduce its diesel variant and maybe a model will be introduced at the Auto Fair next year
 shaayad yahi kaaran he ki tata motors ne phir se singoor main naino plant lagane kii ichha jataai he
 He has said this in the Supreme Court through his lawyer Harish Salve
 unhone sheersh adaalat ko bataaya ki company naino plant ke vistaar ke iraade se vah jameen apane paas rakhana chaahati he
 For now, the company will soon introduce a better model, which it is working on
 is car ke aage or peeche ke hisse ko or behatar banaaya gaya he

 According to Neeraj Shekhar, Chandrasekhar also wanted that the immediate nature of socialism should change in view of the changing political and global scenario
 khaas taur par vah 1991 ke baad ke halaat main is badlaav ko jaruri maan rahe the
 He says "chandrasekhar believed that the benefits of liberalization and globalization are less and losses are greater
 unka kahana tha ki agar videshi companiyon ko desh main aane kii anumati di jaaegi to isse unhen laabh or desh kii companiyon ko nuksaan hoga
 According to Prof
 Anand Kumar, it is ironic that in this era of opportunism spread in Indian democracy, there is no significant legacy of Chandrashekhar left today
 phir bhi sampradayikta, janatantr virodh, garibon kii upeksha or alpsankhyakon ke utpeedan ke har maukey par chandrashekhar ek achche netaa ke rup main yaad kiye jaaenge
 Born on 1 July 1927 at Ibrahimpatti in Ballia district, Uttar Pradesh, Chandrashekhar earned a Masters degree from the University of Allahabad
 unhen chaatr raajnneeti kaa tejatarraar netaa mana jaataa tha
 He came in contact with the powerful socialist Acharya Narendra Dev and learned the story of socialism
 vah varsh 1964 main congress main shaamil hue lekin unhen indira gandhi kii gatividhiyon se kadaa etraj tha
 He split from the party in the year 1975
 chandrashekhar ko apatkaal ke dauraan giraftaar karke jail main daal diya gaya tha

 As a translator of the biography of Bebak / Sushant Jhagandhi and a general reader of Gandhi literature, i feel that the more i know about the graphical detail of Gandhi life, the closer i feel to art
 kisi raajnneetijna kaa kala-rup hona ajeeb baat lagati he
 Gandhi was a political person who was called a politician among saints and a saint among politicians, but he did not know how many forms
 kam se darjan bhar se upar kii bhoomika to unhone khud ginai thi, kaiyon ne do darjan bhi bataai jisamen anuvadak, patrkaar, safaikarmi se lekar dharmaguru or rasoiyaa tak kii bhoomika thi
 Much has been written and spoken about them that there is no escape or repetition to say a lot of things
 lekin jaisaa ki churchill ke ek prakhyat jeevanikar ne kaha ki har yug ke britainvaasiyon ko apana-apana churchill khojna chahie or ye baaten kisi bhi mahaan vyaktitv ke bare main utani hi sach he
 Youth of every age should evaluate Gandhi from their point of view
 kuch saal yaa dashak pehle tak aisa tha ki gandhi vichaar main truti khojna ishaninda sareekha tha
 But now it is not so
 is peedi ke bhartiya gandhi kaa vastunishth or samgr moolyankan kar rahe hai jo uchit bhi he
 Gandhi's idea of blacks in South Africa in the first few days and subsequent changes in him, his proclamation of unilateral celibacy without his wife's consent, relations with his own sons, prohibiting sons from inter-religious marriages, his Khilafat movement And later his relationship with those leaders, his political dealings with Subhash Chandra Bose
 Is controversial and probably puts him in the ranks of a politician "politician"
 lekin ye baaten ye bhi bataati hai ki gandhi kaa vyaktitv sampurna nahin tha or unhone iskaa daawa bhi bahut kam kiya
 Yes, they seemed to be extremely progressive to their age and highly conservative to progressives according to their era and hence they have not yet been forgiven by the people of those two camps
 madhya varg kii yah sanathan traasadee he
 The ideas about the freedom of women going on in the twenty-first century, obviously Gandhi was not his advocate to that extent
 lekin unke aandolan main mahilaayein hissaa le rahi thi or ve unhen jivan ke har kshetra main protsaahit kar rahe the
 He was not untouched by human weaknesses and he was not ready to back down when his emotional and friendly relationship with Rabindranath Tagore's niece Sarladevi Chaudharani developed! But they also accepted the proper opinion of their followers and disciples - this was their specialty
 jaahir he, gandhi tollstoy ke vichaaron se prabhavit hokar ek kramiktavaadi kii tarah vyavhaar kar rahe the jisane gaharaai se ye anubhav kiya tha ki bharat yaa duniya kii samasyaon kaa hal hinsa yaa auchak parivartan main nahin he
 He was a naturalist who reflected not only on his lifestyle but also on his political footsteps
 charlie chaplin ne jab duusare golmos sammelan ke dauraan hui unki landan yatra ke darmyaan unase poocha ki ve aadhunik vigyaan ko lekar itane sanshay main kyon hai, to unka jawaab tha ki ve vigyaan ko lekar sanshay main nahin hai balki uske dwaara insaani shoshan or hinsa ko lekar jarur sanshay main hai
 Gandhi's views on decentralized development, small scale industries, traditional science of knowledge, development of indigenous languages etc
 are such that we feel like a panacea for the many struggles and challenges of the present
 is vaishvik hoti duniya main jisamen vigyaan ne sattatantr ko pichhali sadi se hajaar guna zyada taqatvar bana diya he, pratirodh ke paaramparik tareeke ksheen hote ja rahe hai or gandhivadi tarika shashakt hota ja rahaa he! haal yah he ki arab ke islamic aandolan se lekar honkong or europe tak vahiin tareeke aajamaae ja rahe hai jisaki gandhi ne vakaalat kii thi
 Many experts say that Gandhi was the first Indian politician who did 'cultural mapping' from the West's rule and that is why many Indian scholars from the West and those influenced by him could not forgive Gandhi
 gandhi ghanghor praachyavaadee the lekin pashchim kii urja, anushaasan or gati ke prashansak the
 Here Vivekananda seems impressed by those who said that the good of the world is hidden in the union of East and West
 is lekh kii shuruyaat main gandhi kii tulana kala se kii gai he
 If you borrow the words of Nirmal Verma, an art is interpreted by thousands of people in a thousand meanings, yet it cannot be fully explained
 or us vyakhya ke kram main vah hajaar logon ke antas main kuch na kuch parivartan kar detii he
 Gandhi was such an art
 unki dedh sauveen jayanti par ham itnaa hi kah sakate hai ki vah ‚Äòsant‚Äô rajaneta ek art bhi tha
 a universal and lovely art

 a well-known bone surgeon states that bones of Indian people are traditionally weak and deformed compared to American or British ones and Indians are at greater risk of getting osteoporosis (bone disorder)

 unhone kaha ki ham niyamit vyaayaam kaa jitna dhyaan rakhenge, haddiyon kii takalif se utane hi dur rahenge
 He said that people in western countries are more health conscious and exercise regularly, so their bones are stronger and of the highest quality

 unhone kaha, "nigeria or kenya jaise deshon main haddi ke oparation ke liye bahut se marij mil jaaenge

 unhone kaha ki africa deshon ke saath chikitsa sambandhi dwipaksheeya samjhaute desh main swasthya paryaton ko badhaava de sakate hai

 BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra attacked Azad's statement, saying where do he like Hindus? BJP spokesman Sambit Patra called Azad's statement an insult to Hindus, saying that Ghulam Nabi Azad's statement was abusive towards Hindus

 , While only 5 percent Muslims used to call them in their programs

 It has not been even a decade since all the 125 crore citizens of the country have been given a unique biometric link ID number 'aadhaar'
 112 karod bharatiyon ko yah number diya ja chukaa he
 The government's intention behind starting this Aadhaar program was to create a means of identification of all citizens of the country
 lekin ab jab sarkaar ise apane kaamkaaj ko aasaan karne ke liye istemaal karnaa shuru kar rahi he to andaja lag rahaa he ki uskaa yah program jarurat se zyada vrihad ho jane ke khatre se bhi jujh rahaa he
 The challenge of ID? There is a problem of ID for doing any work in the country
 mobile kaa sim chahie to 2-3 teen idi dijie
 ID for driving license, ID for passport
 kisi sanstha athwa sarkaar dwaara bhi idi maange jane par bhi aap voter idi, driving license, rashan card jaise document saamne kar denge
 But on all these documents, the institutions raise questions even to the distant government
 lihaaja, in sabhi chunautiyon ko hal karne ke liekendra sarkaar kaa aadhaar numberhai
 It is prepared through the unique ratina image and fingerprint from the eyes of the citizens
 is number kaa duplikeshan nahin kiya ja saktaa or ise bataur idi desh main lagu kiya ja rahaa he
 Expanding Aadhaar: Aadhaar number of citizens joining bank accounts will be a means of providing financial support to the government jahaan pehle sirf chune hue padhe-likhe logon tak sarkari skiimon kaa phayda pahunch paata tha jise idi, form ityadi ke istemaal kii jaankaree thi
 With this basis, the government will be able to transfer money directly into the bank accounts of citizens
 jahaan pehle desh kaa ek bada tabaka banking ke daayre se baahar tha aadhaar kii madad se vah bank, insurance sevaaon ke saath-saath sarkaar se swasthya, peedies, jandhan ityadi jaisi sevaaon ko aasaani se le saktaa he
 Services such as borrowing from someone, withdrawing money from pension funds, taking tickets for railways and air travel can also be done easily, if needed
 in sabhi sevaaon ke liye sarkaar athwa sansthaaon ko sirphapake fingerprint yaa aankh ko scankarne kii jarurat hogi or aapako sabhi sevaaon ke liye hari jhandi mil jaaegi
 Like Reliance, the government's work will also be easy: Reliance Industries' mobile network service, recently launched, has been able to add 100 million subscribers in just three months using the Aadhaar network
 vahiin isse pehle sarkari athwa nijee mobile oparator ke offis par ek dupliket sim card nikalwane ke liye aapako lamb-chaude form ke saath kai idi kii photocopy lagaani padati thi
 Now the central government has prepared an option to provide financial help to the citizens by using the Aadhaar on the same lines
 kitna khatra he aadhaar menkendra sarkaar ne jab aadhaar program kii shuruyaat kii thi tab daleel di thi ki yah program puri tarah se nagarikon kii swechha par hoga
 It will not be mandatory to take Aadhaar number
 iskaa istemaal sirf sarkaar dwaara soshal security ke naam par die jane vaale vitti laabh ko sidhe nagarikon ke bank acount main karne ke liye kiya jayega
 But it is clear from the decisions of the Central Government that at present the Central Government is moving towards making Aadhaar mandatory for all services

 bheed bahut thi
 Suddenly a rumor spread that an electric wire fell on the Pipa bridge
 log idhar-udhar bhaagane lage, sankare raste par dabaav bana or bhagdad much gai
 By the time people took the fear of this rumor out of their hearts, by the time they could recover, a lot had been lost

 When Subedar Major Ram Swaroop Purohit, the father of five daughters, retired in 1988, he had a modest pension in his hand and a mountain of responsibilities before his eyes
 48 saal kii umr main unhen rahane ke liye ghar chahie tha, ladakiyon ke liye var chahie the or niyamit aay kaa aisa strot chahie tha, jo asal main jindagi ko nae sire se shuru kar sake
 Because when the people were grooming the future of themselves and their children, this soldier was standing on the border in three wars with Pakistan and China, putting his life for the country
 use itnaa vakt hi nahin mila ki ghar-makaan bana le or baaki jimmedaariyaan samay rahete nibata le
 After retirement in the middle of age, he opened a bicycle shop in his ancestral town Talbehat in Lalitpur district to pull the door of life

 If today the priest was given Rs 21,840
 pension milti he to unase kahin zyada pension unheen kii rank ke un purv sipaahiyon ko mil rahi he jo naukari main unase junior the or jo unke baad ritair hue
 That is why the issue of One Rank One Pension in the country is heating up again before the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin is maahaul main bhi purv sainik purv afasaron se peeche hai
 If you look closely at the people who are demanding 'one Rank One Pension' from the army, you will find that most of them are those who are commissioned officers
 jinaki naukari aaraam se 50 saal yaa zyada tak pahunch jaati he or jo itane padhe-likhe hai ki nijee kshetra unhen naukari dene ko taiyaar rahata he
 On the other hand, there are soldiers who are forced to work as private security guards on a nominal salary
 lekin ek baar phir sainikon kii aawaaj afasaron kii dahaad ke neeche dabati najar aa rahi he
 If not sure, remember the rally of bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi in Rewari town of Haryana adjoining Delhi on 15 September 2013 in which he was addressing ex-servicemen

 darasal sarkaar kaa ishaara saatven vetan ayog main teenon senaaon ke liye alag se intjaam karne yaa phir unke liye alag se vetan ayog banane kii taraf tha
 But it was Brown who, by sending a three-page letter to the Defense Minister, made it clear that the problem is not in the Pay Commission, but in the basic thinking of salary fixation
 darasal, desh main har saal kareeb 65,000 faujee ritair hote hai or ek anumaan ke mutabik abhi 23 lakh purv faujee or 3 lakh purv sainikon kii vidhwaaen hai‚Äô in logon ne indian eks sarvicemen movement (iiesam) naamak sanghathan banaakar purv phogiyon ke pension kii visangatiyon ko dur karaane ke liye teen dashak se chali aa rahi muhim tej kar di he
 The reason for this demand of former soldiers is the government policy under which the army is retired at a young age for the purpose of keeping soldiers

 ‚Äù ve civil police ke consteble or sena ke ek sipaahi kii tulana karte hai, ''sipaahi 35 saal main ritair hota he or consteble 60 kii umr main
 If you see the difference of salary, then an army soldier till the age of 60 years will get Rs 47 lakh
 kaa nuksaan hota he
 After all, what is the fault of army personnel? "kadayan has met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2008 to demand troopers and returned 30,000 medals to the President in a gradual hunger strike in 2009
 lekin jaise-jaise sena main van rank-van pension kaa mudda garm ho rahaa he, baaki vibhaag bhi sakriy hote dikh rahe hai
 The railway department with 14 lakh employees and 7 lakh pensioners is also raising demand for One Rank One Pension

 We want the Army to succeed in this matter

 We do not even know from where the ITBP rule of retirement came in 57 years
 ‚Äùdarasal har sarkari mahakme main vetan or pension ko lekar aisi-aisi visangatiyaan hai ki agar sarkaar ne inhen chhedaa to jinn ko bottle se baahar nikaalane jaisaa alam hoga
 If only ex-servicemen are given the same rank equal pension as before January 1, 2006, then the central government will immediately get around Rs 1,300 crore

 The Ministry of Personnel has even said that the implementation of One Rank One Pension will not only increase the financial burden on the exchequer, but Civilian pensioners will also raise such demands and this will result in salaries of Rs 8-9,000 crore

 In such a situation, lakhs of old soldiers like Subedar Major Purohit might have to wait a long time to get 'one Rank, One Pension'

 The SP and the BSP are together once again
 kaaran sirf itnaa ki bhaajapa ko haraana he
 There was a wave of Narendra Modi in 2014
 isi vajah se upi main bhaajapa ko 78 main se 71 siten mili thim
 This is not the first time that SP-BSP opposing each other has come together
 thik aise hi 26 saal pehle 1993 main ayodhya ke ram mandir kii lahar thi
 The Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati alliance formed to defeat the BJP hopes that they can both show the charisma of 1993
 1993 main mulaayam singh yadav or kanshiram ne ram mandir lahar ke bich bhaajapa ko rokane main safalataa pai thi
 Let us tell you how SP-BSP defeated BJP 26 years ago
 
 
 sapa-basapa ne 1993 main milakar jiti thim 176 siten1993 main upi vidhansabha main 422 siten thim
 The SP had fielded 256 and BSP 164 seats
 sapa ne 109 or basapa ne 67 siten jiti thim
 The two parties together captured 176 seats
 haalanki, bhaajapa ne 177 siten jiti thim
 However, the SP-BSP formed a government with some parties including Janata Dal
 bhaajapa ko puraa bharosa tha ki ram lahar use dobaaraa satta degi
 The proximity of Kanshi Ram and Mulayam Singh Yadav was the focus of discussion then
 is dauraan ek naaraa ‚Äòmili mulaayam kanshiram, hawa main ud gaye jayshri ram‚Äô bhi charchaa main tha
 If the voting happened like 2014, then the BJP lost the vote share of BJP and Apna Dal in 2014 43
 63% tha, jo sapa-basapa ke kul vot share 42
 Is greater than 12%
 agar, siton ke hisaab se dekhen or sapa-basapa kaa vot share milaayaa jaae to 41 siton par bhaajapa ko baari nuksaan ho saktaa he
 But, the result depends on issues, not mathematics
 2014 main congress ke khilaaf anti-inakambency thi, isliye logon ne bhaajapa ko chunaa tha
 The biggest two issues will be the performance of the Modi government in 2019
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan kii safalataa jaateey samikarnon par nirbhar karegi
 The BSP announced its withdrawal of support in June 1995 after almost 2 years of being together with the SP-BSP from the guesthouse scandal
