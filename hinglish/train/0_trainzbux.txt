 The appeal filed in the Supreme Court states that Hajj is a religious pilgrimage and GST should not be imposed on it
 isse pehle bhi haj yatra par jiesti hataane kii maangen uthati rahi hai
 Under the new Haj policy for the year 2018 to 2022, there is a provision to levy GST on this yatra

 Since then, this policy has been opposing among the Muslim sections

 Under this policy, the burden on pilgrims visiting Hajj and Umrah every year may increase

 Of this, there is a 70:30 split between the government and private tour operators

 input:ians Demonetization is about to complete one year
 lekin is ek saal ke dauraan logon ko kai kadave anubhav hue
 Today we will tell you about such people, for whom demonetisation proved to be a nightmare
 sabase pehle baat laksminagar main rahane vaale pramod kii
 Pramod is an insurance adviser by profession
 pichley saal lagu huinotbandike baad pramod ne bhi apane peshey main digital pement ko tavajjo dena shuru kar diya tha
 But what happened to them last month changed their thinking about cashless transactions
 oktober main pramod ne card se ek policy kaa pement kiya tha
 After this, the amount was deducted from Pramod's account, but the insurance company did not get it
 tab se pramod kai baar bank ke customer care main phone kar chuke hai or kai baar bank ke chakkar laga chuke hai
 But even after a month has passed, they have not received the money from their account
 ab pramod puch rahe hai ki unka paisa aakhir gaya to gaya kahaan
 Pramod says that he will not make digital payments in life
 sab cash main hi karenge
 According to Pramod, the bank got the form filled with them, but no one is ready to tell where the money went
 pramod akele nahin, jinako notebandi ne pareshaan kiya
 According to Balakishan Sharma, who runs a grocery wholesale shop in Shahdara, everything was fine till November 8 last year

 After the demonetisation, some months passed very heavily, but now after a year, we have been able to go somewhere

 While their business runs more on cash
 ghonda main restaurant chalaane vaale rahul choudhary kii kahani bhi kuch alag nahin
 After the demonetisation, all banks from Paytm started taking debit and credit cards, whose picture is seen from these posters sticking on their counters
 lekin malaal is baat kaa he ki har graahak Paytm lekar nahin aata
 Therefore, there is still a strong emphasis on cash
 rahul ke mutabik restaurant main pehle pair rakhane kii jagah nahin hoti thi
 But now only a few people are coming
 unamem se zyaadaatar wo jo sirf samosa, chaay or colddrink pikar hi chale jate hai
 Hence, there are also wards of giving the salary of the staff

 There should not be an impression of Manmohan Singh in this budget, but the impression of Rahul Gandhi is definitely that India is divided into two parts
 ek hissaa bharat he or doosraa india
 p Chidambaram caught it so tightly that instead of falling the wall started to look higher
 haalanki daawa ye he ki ye koshish usee diwaar ko todane ke liye he
 After this budget, you can say that India is happy India despondent
 dil kholkar rakh diya he vitt mantri ne bharat ko khush karne main
 India means that part of the country which is either very backward or less developed
 or india matlab wo hissaa jo roti-kapadaa or makaan ke janjaal se aage bad chukaa he, uski kamai moti he, mahange restraan main khaanaa khaataa he, kam se kam rajdhani yaa hawaii jahaaj main safar karata he or videshon main chhuttiyaan manaata he
 Reasons for India to be happy
 
 
 -mahilaon or bacchon ke liye 97136 karod
 37303 crores for education and health
 - isamen rashtriya gramin swasthya mishan par 21000 karod shaamil he
 65887 crores to the Ministry of Human Resource Development
 - gramin vikaas ke liye 80 hajaar karod
 There are more reasons for India to be happy in Chidambaram's budget
 sabko baant-baantkar diya he, kisi ko nahin choda
 Less than anyone, but more to everyone
 - saaf peyajal par 15260 karod
 - Mid-day meal 13215 crores
 - kuposhan se ladane ke liye alag se 300 karod
 The sight of concessions did not stop here
 - manaregaa 33000 karod

 The poor person waits for the whole year, do something of the tax
 lekin chidambaram ne brake laga liya
 - Meaning there is no relief to tax payers
 jitna dete the utana hi dete rahiye
 Great relief was expected on home loan, but Chidambaram has caught the tilt by giving a discount of 1 lakh on a house of 25 lakh
 25 lakh kaa ghar miltaa kahaan he ye apane aap main khoj kaa vishay he
 - If you have bought a house worth more than 50 lakhs by juggling from anywhere, then give 1% TDS to the government

 Apart from this, the UP police has created a software called Aasman (advanced Application for Social Media Analytics), through which any person using social media or his post can be easily tracked
 gadabadi failaane vaala koi post kis jile ke kis computer yaa phir mobile se post yaa phir share kiya gaya he, iskaa pataa bhi aasaani se lagaaya ja saktaa he

 Today, there is talk of making the whole of India a Digital India, while the story of the village inhabiting India is telling a different picture
 taaja aankadon ke mutabik gaanv main rahane vaale 14-18 ayuvarg ke 59 pratishat yuvaaon ne kabhi computer kaa istemaal nahin kiya he vahiin 64 pratishat yuvaaon ne internet kaa upyog nahin kiya he
 CA 2018: Mohit of Karnal did the top, this one strategy gave success
 This important information came from the ASER-2017 annual report released by Pratham, an NGO working in the field of education
 yah sanstha varsh 2005 se har saal, anual states of ajukeshan report (asar) jari karti aa rahi he
 'asar' talks about children's enrollment in school, ability to do basic education and basic math
 haalanki is baar kii report main aise yuvaaon kii baat kii gai he jo 14 se 18 aayu varg ke bich aate hai
 According to the 2011 census, there are 100 million youth in this age group in the country at this time
 156 pej kii is report main kai ahm jaankariyaan di gai hai
 According to this report, 73 percent of the youth had used mobile in the last one week
 itani pratishat ladkiyaan nahin istemaal karti mobilemobile phone aaj ham sabaki ahm jarurat ban gaya he, lekin ladke or ladakiyon ke mobile phone istemaal karne main chaunkaane vaala bada antar bhi saamne aayaa he
 According to the report 'asar-2017', 12 percent are boys who have never used mobile phones, while 22 percent are girls who do not have access to mobile phones
 anchal ne aise kiya bharat kaa naam roshan, modi ne bhi kii thi taribais report se yah bhi maaloom chalata he jaise-jaise umr badhati he vaise-vaise yuvaaon ke bich mobile phone kaa istemaal badhata he
 64 percent of 14-year-old youth have used mobile phones in the past week, while 82 percent of 18-year-old youth have used mobile phones in the past week
 himachal kii gita verma baniin WHO kii calendar girl, mukhyamantri ne kii tarifhalanki is report main ek baat khaas taur se kahi gai he ki aaj bhi gaanv ke yuvaaon ke bich computer or internet kii pahunch bahut kam he
 In the past week, 28 percent have used the Internet and 26 percent have used computers
 iskaa taatpary he ki 59 pratishat ne computer or 64 pratishat ne internet kaa istemaal kabhi nahin kiya he
 At the same time, the question is that Internet and computer is not able to reach rural youth in India, so how can we think about Digital India
 offis ho yaa ghar, har jagah sambandhon kaa acha hona jaruri hota he
 At times, we have some human weaknesses in our personality, due to which our relationship deteriorates
 aaie jaanate hai raashi anusaar kin baton kaa dhyaan rakhen or kya upaay karen jinase aapke rishte behatar ho jaaen
 Aries zodiac - are very short tempered
 bahut jaldi gussa aata he
 Hence their relationship with their juniors and seniors deteriorates very quickly
 niyamit rup se surya ko jal arpit karen 
 Taurus - Stubborn nature is very much inside them
 offis main aksar peeth peeche inke sahyogi inkaa virodh karte hai 
 This problem is improved by offering water to Shiva
 mithun raashi- krodh main ye apni vaani par niyantran nahin rakh pate
 They carry on working in the office, but difficulties arise in the family
 nity praatah hanuman chalisa kaa paath karnaa laabhadaayak hoga
 Cancer zodiac- People of this zodiac have a childlike nature
 choti choti baton par gussate or maanate hai 
 Their nature is generally not bad, but people always keep a wrong impression about them
 kaale rang ke prayog or tel masaale ke seven se bachanaa laabhakaari hoga
 Leo zodiac- People of this zodiac sign have a lot of anger
 inkaa krodh aksar visphotak ho jaataa he
 Due to their fierce nature, they often dispute with higher officials
 ravivaar ko namak or adarak ke seven se parhez karen 
 Virgo - People of this zodiac know how to control their nature and behavior
 apana nuksaan kabhi nahin karte
 Whether seniors or juniors, all remain under their influence
 parantu parivaar ke logon ke saath aksar inaki nahin banati
 If this is the problem, then donate sweet things on Tuesday
 tula raashi- is raashi ke logon kii apane seniors ke saath khub nibhati he 
 But it does not play well with juniors
 parivaar main ye log sambandh nibhaane kii khub koshish karte hai par vahaan nibh hi nahin paati
 To overcome the problem, they should worship Shani Dev
 vrishchik raashi- is raashi ke log apane juniurs or sinitors ke saath thik sambandh banane kii koshish karte hai
 But often fall prey to controversy and conspiracy
 paariwarik sambandh koshish karke nibhaa or bana hi lete hai
 To avoid problems, they should fast on Monday
 dhanu raashi- is raashi ke logon ke swabhaav par koi niyantran nahin hota
 When anger comes you can go to any extent
 seniors ke saath banane ke liye ji tod koshish karte hai 
 And do not care for juniors and family members at all
 inako surya ko niyamit jal arpit karnaa chahie
 Capricorn- These people know when and how to treat them
 offis or ghar main aksar raajnneeti or dimag se kaam lete hai
 Sometimes their anger spoils their close relationships
 inako ek chaandi kaa kadaa dhaaran karnaa chahie 
 Aquarius - People of this zodiac are extremely moody
 prem main seniors , juniurs or parivaar ke logon ke saath khub sambandh banane kaa prayaas karte hai 
 But when anger comes, nobody cares
 inako gita kaa niyamit paath karnaa chahie or nashe se bachanaa chahie
 Pisces zodiac - These people are very active with their juniors and seniors
 thode laaparvaah hone ke kaaran parivaar main ban paanaa mushkil hota he
 They should consume sugar in milk regularly
 kaashi vishwanath kaa banaras badal gaya he
 Will change further
 banaras ke jis hisse ko duniya ke pracheen basaavaton main gina jaataa tha uskaa kaaphi kuch ab gaayab ho chukaa he
 The whole of Benaras may be Benaras, but the real Banaras is what is called the city of Baba
 jahaan baba vishwanath kaa mandir he or mandir ke aas paas galiyon kaa sansar tha
 Generally, if there was any interference in such an old settlement in any country of the world, then there would be a stir
 magar baat-baat par bolne vaali kaashi bhi kolahal paidaa nahin kar saki
 Who should read this silence of Kashi according to his own words when only famous people could not speak
 magar charchaa honi chahie thi
 In the city as well as outside the city
 har badlaav ko ricard kiya janaa chahie tha
 a gentleman present in Benares said that Baba Vishwanath is now with Baba Somnath
 matlab yahi tha ki un tak pahunchane kaa rasta chaudaa or sapaat ho gaya he
 The lanes are missing and the ground is like that
 8 march ko pradhanmantri ne kaashi vishwanath dham project kaa shilanyas kiya
 He also said that what happened is a matter of research
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki itnaa bada project bagaiyr kisi bade raajnneetik virodh ke puraa ho rahaa he yah koi saamaanya baat nahin he
 There was also minor opposition from the people
 is project par banaras hindu uniwarsity ko research karnaa chahie
 The name of the project is Kashi Vishwanath temple expansion beautification scheme
 april 2017 main yah yojana ai ki vishwanath mandir ke saraswati phatak se lekar lalita ghat manikarnika ghat hote hue 24,000 varg feet ilaake main ek ganga pathave banaaya jayega jiskaa naam hoga vishwanath koridor
 Under the Vishwanath Mandir Trust, he purchased 250 houses falling on this route by compensation, which the Prime Minister was mentioning that people quietly left without giving their house to Baba
 puraane gharon se 33 mandir bhi nikle hai jinka punaroddhar kiya jayega
 This part of Kashi is completely new
 vaisaa nahin he jo is dharti par kaashi ko dekhne vaale zindaa logon kii smritiyon main hai
 They must now place this new Kashi in their memories
 kai log ise lekar utsahit bhi hai or kai bahut kuch kho dene ke kaaran udhaas bhi
 The new Banaras grown among the old Banaras who know Banaras in Benares are astonishing
 ankhen faad kar dekhte hai to purana banaras nazar nahin aata or khulkar bolte hai to nayaa banaras chup kara detaa he
 From entering the temple to the exit after worship, a wide field has started to appear
 ganga tak kaa rasta bhi ab khulaa maidan sa dikhataa he
 This is just the first phase
 duusare charan main pracheen mandiron kaa punaroddhar hoga
 Museum will be built here in the third phase
 librari banegi
 Rest house will be built
 40 foot chaude galiyare ke kinare yah sab banegaa
 Everything is happening on such a large scale, people are neither talking about apprehensions nor cheating on enthusiasm
 pradhanmantri research kii baat kar rahe hai
 The Prime Minister in his speech said a lot about this project
 magar is project ko lekar jo vigyaapan chapa tha, uske bare main main kuch kahana chahta hum
 The project they want to present to the world by conducting research
 us project ke vigyaapan main yah chape ki kaashi vishwanath project main pankhaa or cooler lagegaa
 Cantonment will be made and drinking water will be provided
 yah pradhanmantri ke kaarykram kii garima ke anukool nahin lagata he
 It seems that the UP Public Relations Department did not know the importance of this project or else he would not write such a small thing that a fan would be cooler

 Input IANS bharat-pakistan ke bich border par tanaav or kootnithik jang ke bich guuruuvaar ko piem modi or pakistani pradhanmantri navaj sharif kazakhstan ke astana main aamane-saamne hue
 Dua-salaam also took place when the leaders of the two countries who went to Astana for the SCO conference met face to face in a program
 sutron ke mutabik piem modi ne navaj sharif se unke sehat ke bare main poocha
 PM Modi then took the news from Sharif about his mother and the rest of the family
 haalanki iske baad saanskrithik kaarykram main piem modi or sharif ne ek-duusare se kaaphi duuri par baithe the
 This was PM Modi's first meeting with Nawaz Sharif since 2015
 isse pehle piem modi achaanak disambar 2015 main navaj sharif ke janmdin par unke ghar lahore ja pahunche the
 The Foreign Ministry's statement came amidst dua-salaam that there was no proposal for bilateral talks
 isse pehle sushamaa swaraj ne bhi elaan kiya tha ki aatankwaad ke saath-saath baatcheet nahin kii ja sakati
 modi-nawaz has also met earlier during the SAARC meeting
 modi ke nimantran par navaj 2014 main dilli aakar shapath grahan samaaroh main bhi shaamil hue the lekin kya aaj ke halaat main dosti kii raah par aage bad paanaa donon netaaon ke liye sambhav he
 There are 5 big difficulties in this path, which do not seem possible to overcome
 1
 pak's help to separatism in Kashmir The situation in Kashmir today is more complicated than before
 modi sarkaar kisi bhi haalat main ghati se algaavvaad auki aatankwaad ko khatm karne kaa faisla kar chuki he
 The army has full freedom of operation
 ghati main algaavvaad or patharbaji ke liye pakistan se mil rahe paise par bhi shikanja kasne ke liye enie jaanch main juty hui he
 On the other hand, Pakistan openly declares that its support for the conflict in Kashmir will continue
 aise main navaj or modi kii dosti kii gaadi aage kaise badhegi isko lekar sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 2
 border par tanaav or ghuspaith kii badi ghatnaayenkashmir main jari patharbaji or hinsak pradarshnon ke bich elosi par bhi sena ne sakhti badha di he
 In the last 48 hours, there have been 4 infiltration attempts on the loc in which 7 Pakistani terrorists have been killed
 naugam-poonch-naushera-machhil samet kai ilaakon se pakistan lagaataar ghuspaith kii koshish kar rahaa he lekin mustaid sena ke jawan lagaataar in koshishon ko vifal kar rahe hai
 In the DGMO meeting, it has been clearly told to Pakistan that if the firing from Pakistan will be fully answered
 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne saaf elaan kiya he ki aatankwaad or baatcheet saath-saath nahin chal sakate
 3
 jadhav cese ko lekar jari kootnithik jangpakistan main kulbhushan jadhav ko faansee kii sajaa sunaae jane ke baad donon deshon ke bich kootnithik jang bhi chhidi hui he
 In any case, Pakistan is adamant on hanging Kulbhushan but the international court has given a shock to Pakistan by stopping it till the completion of the trial
 pakistan kii bigadel sena is maamle main adi hui he or vahaan kii sarkaar is disha main koi faisla shaayad hi le
 Therefore, Jadhav's case is also a big hurdle in starting bilateral talks
 4
 In Pakistan, whenever the army intervener Sharif extends a hand of friendship with India, there is an obstacle from the army
 1999 main vaajapeyi sarkaar ke saath vaarta ke turant baad kargil yuddh hona or lahore main modi-navaj mulaakaat ke baad pathankot-uri hamale pakistani sena or iesai kii shah par hue
 Their clear motive was to derail the dialogue
 pakistan main sarkaar sena ke is sathganth kaa koi tod nahin nikaal saki he or sena kabhi bhi bharat ke saath shanti ke raste par pakistan ko badhane nahin degi
 This is also a big obstacle in the way of friendship
 5
 china-pakistan's growing friendship china-pakistan Economic Corridor, China's growing economic interest in Pakistan is also a hindrance in the way of friendship
 pakistani aatankiyon par bain ke raste main china apane vito kaa istemaal kar pakistani sena or janata ko khush karata he
 Due to the growing friendship of china-pakistan, India will have to move towards strengthening relations with countries like america-japan etc
 enesji main bharat kii sadsyta ke raste main bhi china roda ban rahaa he
 Along with India, it is also trying to get membership in Pakistan
 bharat or pakistan ke bich baatcheet aane vaale dinon main patari par lautati nahin dikh rahi
 In a conversation on religious fundamentalism, Babylon Supriyo admitted that he ate beef during college days
 prakaash raaj ke dharmik ashishnutaa ke aarope par babul ne safai di ki wo dharmik bhedbhaav nahin karte
 When Modi's minister and Prakash Raj confronted each other on religious fanaticism, he said, "I grew up in Bengal
" main imambara ke paas rahaa hum
 i have eaten beef during college days
 mere bahut saare videshi dost hai
 i have many Pakistani friends
 muslimon ke tyoharon main maine khushiyaan manaai hai, mithaiyaan khai hai
 i cannot say that i have never visited a temple or visited a mosque
 lekin main ye jarur kahuunga ki yadi musalmaan basti main suar kaa maance nahin bechaa jaataa to usee tarah hinduon ke saamne gaay kaa maance nahin bechaa janaa chahie
 Babul said these things during a session in India Today's 'karnataka Panchayat' held in Bengaluru (karnataka)
 is seshan main babul ke alaava abhinayta prakaash raaj ke congress leader khushboo sundar, bijepi pravaktaa malvika avanish bhi thim
 Rajdeep Sardesai moderated the session
 meri daadi najar utaarne ke liye mujhe masjid le jaati thim: babul supriyobabul supreyo ne kaha, dharmik sahishnutaa kaa matlab yah nahin he ki main apane dharm kaa aadar na karun
 The biggest thing is that if i do not respect my religion myself, how will anyone else do it? i have visited both the temple and the mosque
 bachapan kaa zikr karte hue bataaya, main kisi tarah ke puja-paath par vishwaas nahin karata, lekin mujhe yaad he meri daadi mujhe masjid le jaaya karti thim

 dilli hoicourt ne sarkari skool main teachers kii bhartee na hone ko lekar lagaai gai janhit yachika par dilli sarkaar ko notice bheja he
 Thousands of teachers have not yet been admitted even after several orders of the High Court
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki court sarkaar ko nirdesh de taaki samaybaddh tareeke se teachers kii bhartee ho sake
 On the basis of information collected through RTI in the PIL filed in the High Court, the court has been told that a total of 14743 people of teaching and non-teaching are required in Delhi government schools
 sirf 9366 teaching or non teaching staff hi philhal skulon main hai
 The recruitment of about 5377 teaching and non-teaching staff has still not been done
 iske alaava dilli sarkaar ke skulon ke infrastracchar par bhi is janhit yachika main sawaal khadey kiye gaye hai
 The petition has demanded the introduction of transportation system on the lines of private schools to allow children studying in government schools to travel from home
 saath hi sarkari skulon main nijee skulon kii tarah nursery or kindergarton kii padhai bhi shuru karne ke liye vikalp talashne kii maang kii gai he
 The petitioner has told in the information collected through RTI that 150 children are seated together in a class room in a room of 20x20, which is also dangerous for them in terms of health
 yachikaamein kaha gaya he ki dilli ke skulon main shikshakon ke kaaphi pad khaali hai, jisase shiksha kii gunvattta par kaaphi asar padaa he
 The court will hear the case again on November 2
 is tarah kii janhit yachika dilli sarkaar ke un bade-bade daavon kii pole kholti he jisamen sarkaar har duusare din sarkari skulon ke infrastracchar or suvidhaon ko badhaane kaa bakhaan karti he
 In terms of statistics, there has been a slight reduction in rape incidents in Delhi, but at least 5 girls are still raped every day in Delhi
 ji haa, har roj kam se kam 5 ladakiyon ke saath
 And we are not saying this but the statistics of Delhi Police, which she has released in this year's annual press conference, saying that now women are safe in Delhi
 dilli police ke aankadon par agar najar daalen to dilli main rose kam se kam 5ladakiyon se balaatkaarhota he
 Surprisingly, in 96% of rape incidents, only the knowledgeable are guilty
 yahi vajah he ki repist main sabase zyaada taadaad 'family frends' kii he
 We can say that in comparison to 2016, there has been a decrease in the cases of rape, modesty and molestation, ie crime against women
 lekin sachai to ye he ki pichley do saalon main rape ke sirf 15 maamle hi kam hue hai
 In 2016, there were 2,264 rapes in Delhi
 jabaki 2017 main 2 hazaar 49 ladkiyaan rape kaa shikaar baniin
 Similarly, in 2016 there were 435 cases of modesty breach
 jabaki pichley saal usase kam 3 hazaar 2 sau maamle darj hue2016 main chhedchhad ke 894 maamle darj kiye gaye the
 While 621 cases of molestation have been reported in the last year
 lekin rape ke maamalon kaa trend vahi pehle kii tarah hi khataranaak he
 In Delhi, as many as girls or women with rape are also dangerous, 96 percent of cases are known to rapist girls, while only 4 percent girls are victims of strangers
 dilli police kii maane to dilli main sabase zyaada 38 fisadi rape family friend karte hai
 This is followed by the neighbors with 19 percent
 ladakiyon kii aabru luutane main rishtedaar bhi peeche nahin hai
 14 percent of rapes do the same
 jabaki 4 fisadi sahakarmi balaatkaari nikalate hai
 In this way, 20 percent of people are knowledgeable about girls
 aise main police mahilaon ko surakshit rakhane ke chaahe jo bhi jatan karen, khud mahilaon ko bhi sajag satark rahane kii zarurat he
 Gender sensitization at home is also a demand of the times
 ucchtam nyaayalay ke purv nyaayadhish markandeya katju ne somvaar ko kaha ki sheersh adaalat ne saumya maamle main aaropee ko die gaye mrityudand ko aaajeevan karawas main badalakar gambhir bhoolen kin or isaki vajah yah he ki nyaayadhish lambit maamalon ke baari boj kii vajah se maamalon par zyada samay nahin de pate hai
 In his Facebook post, he said, "I truly believe that the Supreme Court has made some serious mistake in its decision by changing the death penalty pronounced by the Kerala High Court
" '' unhone kaha, ''sambhavatya ye galtiyaan isliye huin kyonki adaalat par kaam kaa itnaa zyada boj he ki vah maamalon par utana vakt nahin de paati jitne ki vah hakdaar hai, yadi maamalon kaa aisa baari boj nahin hota to chijen kuch or hotin
 '' bhartiya press parishad ke purv adhyaksh ne kaha ki jab unhone suna ki unhen 11 november ko peshi ke liye notice jari kiya gaya he to vah pareshaan ho gaye or unhone sochaa ki ucchtam nyaayalay unhen apamaanit karne kaa praytn kar rahaa he kyonki unhone uske faisle kii aalochana kii he, aisa aadesh apratyaashit tha
 Therefore, he initially said that he would not appear
 unhone kaha ki jab unhen ucchtam nyaayalay kaa notice praapt hua or unhone use padhaa tab unhen ahsaas hua ki adaalat ne mere liye bahut hi sammanjanak bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya he or mujhase pesh hone ke liye anurodh kiya he na ki mujhe aadesh diya he
 As he appears serious about reconsidering his decision and is not obstinate in this matter
 tippaniyan He said, "we are all human beings and we all make mistakes but the gentleman is the one who realizes his mistake, accepts it and tries to rectify it
 yah nyaayadhishon par bhi lagu hota he

 He said, "perhaps these mistakes happened because the court is so much burdened with work that it is not able to give as much time to the cases as it deserves, things would have been different if the cases had not had such a heavy burden
" '' The former President of the Press Council of India said that he was upset when he heard that he had been issued notice for production on 11 November and thought that the Supreme Court was trying to humiliate him as he criticized his decision

 He said that when he received the notice of the Supreme Court and read it, he realized that the court had used very respectful language for me and requested me to appear and not ordered me

 In terms of the Indian team, India has not lost a match since 2005 at the ground of Kotla
 tab se bhartiya team ne is maidan par saat match khele hai, jisamen paanch main use jeet mili he jabaki ek match radd ho gaya or ek match benatija rahaa he
 For India, however, Virat Kohli is the only player of the current team in Kotla to score a century

 Will Dhoni come out with some changes in the team on this pitch suited to batting
 niyamit spin gendbaaj ravichandran aswin kii anupasthiti main pichley match main shaamil amit mishra jaraa bhi prabhavit nahin kar sake
 In such a situation, can Kuldeep Yadav be given a chance to make his debut or will he call a specialist batsman in the team, given the batting performance of the batsmen in the last match and without taking risks, part-time spin bowlers like Dhoni, Ravindra Jadeja and Suresh Raina will work? 
 dhoni agar aisa karte hai to murali vijay ko mauka mil saktaa he
 There is also a lack of an aggressive batsman in the lower order
 kohli or raina par nishchit taur par is match main khud ko sabit karne kaa dabaav bhi rahegaa
 Recently, news came that actress Jacqueline Fernandes was going to sing an item in her production film 'hero' at the behest of Salman Khan
 is gaanaa film kabold ganahone vaala tha or isaki reharsal bhi shuru ho chuki thi
 But now the news is that this song will not be shot
 ek angreji akhbaar ke mutabik, diarector or mekars ko ab us gane kii jarurat nahin lag rahi he or iske alaava shooting ko sthagit bhi kar diya gaya he
 However Jacqueline and actor Suraj Pancholi were rehearsing this song for several days
 salmaan khandwara produs kii ja rahi is film memsuraj pancholike saath actor sunil shetty kii beti atiya shetty lead role main najar aaenge
 This film has been directed by Nikhil Advani
 yah film mashhoor nirmaataa nirdeshak subhash ghai kii film 'hero' kaa rimek he
 Subhash Ghai wants Nikhil Advani's film to be a bigger hit than the old film 'hero'
 'mohabbat main nahin he fark jeene or marane kaa, usee ko dekhakar jite hai jis kaafir par dam nikle
 ' dhoni ke bare main sochate-sochate mirza gaalib sahab kaa yah sher achaanak jehan main aayaa
 No matter how much people hate Dhoni, Murid will also be his biggest critic for watching him play
 main hameshaa us vichaardhaara kaa rahaa hum ki test cricket main, phir se kah duun ki sirf test cricket main dhoni kabhi captaini ke myanon main khare nahin utre or ye baat khud dhoni bhi shaayad maanate honge
 His technique is no better than any club cricketer
 swing or oochaal leti gendon ko vah jis tarah khelte hai, usase coach yuva khilaadiyon ko jarur bataate honge ki in gendon ko kaise na khelaa jaae! lekin, team main bataur wicket keeper or ballebaaj unki bhoomika kabhi sawaalon main nahin rahi
 Well, we humans have a tendency to criticize someone while we live, but after someone's departure, we always remember him as a good person
 dhoni ne 90 test match khele
 Lost almost every match abroad
 
 
 par sawaal yah he ki koun-sa captain videsh main jeeta he? koi nahin
 India has never had any bowler who gives them a Test match and, if a bowler had done a great job, the batsmen would have blown his actions
 par, sawaal ye he ki dhoni aakhir itani der tak captain kaise bane rahe? to yahaan bataa den ki isamen dhoni kii kismat or virendra sahvaag kaa bada yogadan he
 
 
 
 donon dhoni ke natrutv main khub chale or dhoni ne iskaa fal bhi khub khaaya
 Not only this, Harbhajan Singh, Gautam Gambhir, Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman played the best cricket of their career when Mahendra Singh Dhoni was the captain
 nateeja yah rahaa ki ye khilaadi khelte gaye, dhoni jitate gaye or vaah-wahi lutate gaye
 Between the series of two Test matches would be ODI cricket and T20, in which Mahi would surprise everyone and in short format his success would be redeemed in Test cricket, but, today when Dhoni has retired from Test cricket The silence of these senior players answers many questions
 na sahvaag, na gambhir, na yuvaraj or na harbhajan singh ne kaha ki dhoni ne bhartiya test cricket ke liye kya kiya! meraa khud kaa akalan he ki maahi ne desh or chayankartaaon ko kam se kam is baat ke liye taiyaar kar liya he ki agar ham 2015 world cap nahin jite to un par isaki zyada gaaj na gire
 Under the circumstances of Australia, it seems very difficult for this team to save the World Cup crown and who can understand this better than Dhoni
 khayr, ab kohli yug ke liye taiyaar ho jaae or shuruaati daur se to yahi lagata he ki jitna kohli maidan par ulajhenge or ladenge utani hi dhoni kii shakhsiyat zyada badi najar aegi

 Police sources said on Tuesday that a minor girl belonging to a Brahmin family went missing on September 8 in Tithrouda village of Singhwali Ahir police station area

 Police has registered a case of disappearance of the girl in this regard

 upwas jo desh kii aazaadee kii ladaai ke dauraan british hukumat ke khilaaf mahatma gandhi kaa mukhya hathiyaar hota tha vahi upwas aaj ke daur main satta paksh or vipaksh ke liye raajnneetik hit saadhane kaa aujaar ban gaya he
 On 9 April, the Congress, under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi, fasted across the country in the name of harmony in support of Dalits and in various sections of the society
 vahiin,bijepine vipaksh kii ore se sansad nahin chalane dene ke virodh main guuruuvaar ko deshbhar main upwas rakhaa
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi sat down at Rajghat on April 9, but the picture of some Delhi Congress leaders eating food before the fast made him laugh out loud
 congress ke upwas main hui kirakiri ko dekhte hue bijepi bahut satark rahi
 Due care was taken to ensure that no false message goes anywhere during the party fast
 upwas ko deshbhar main safal banane ke liye baqayada planning bhi kii gai or kendriya mantriyon ko desh ke kone-kone main bheja gaya
 From Delhi to Chennai to Bangalore to Patna, all the Union Ministers were absorbed in fasting
 dilli ke hanuman mandir main bhi kendriya mantriyon kaa tantaa laga
 Those who arrived here included Smriti Irani, Maneka Gandhi, Vijay Goel, Suresh Prabhu, Narendra Singh Tomar
 party netaa upwas par baithe to samarthan main bhaajapa kaaryakarta bhi anushaasan main dikhe
 However, there were dozens of people who were brought to fill empty chairs
 is maukey par kendriya mantri vijay goyal or bijepi saansad ne congress par nishaanaa saadhane main koi kasar nahin chodi
 He said that the way the Congress party wasted the country's money by not allowing Parliament to run and all the important bills could not be passed, the leaders and activists of the party have fasted across the country
 bijepi ne sochi samajhi ranneeti ke dilli main upwas kii jagah ke liye chandani chowk ke toun haul kii jagah hanuman mandir ko chunaa
 Food and drink shops nearby also appeared closed
 aam taur par guuruuvaar ko ye dukaane khuli rahati hai
 Harish Khurana, who exposed the Congress's fast, was seen praising the BJP openly for today's fast
 khurana ne kaha, 'bhaajapaayiyon ko upwas upwas karnaa aata he
 Those with spiritual power need no hypocrisy
 'bijepi ke upwas ke dauraan party kaaryakarta anushaasit hokar gambhirtha se apane netaaon ke bhaashan sunate najar aae
 There were also some who were probably brought to fill the chairs
 naa to unka upwas se koi vaasta tha or naa unhen ye pataa tha ki kis mudde par upwas rakhaa ja rahaa he
 One such person was Suresh who was brought from Gurgaon with 30 more people
 sudhir gudgaanv ke sector-12 main rahete hai or unke ghar main bijli nahin aati he
 Due to this, the distressed Suresh was told that his problem would be solved by coming here
 isi ke chalate wo apane saathiyon ke saath dilli main bijepi ke upwas sthal tak aa gaya
 However, this political tug-up between the ruling BJP and the opposition Congress over fasting is not seen to end

 UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said in the Chief Minister's Secretariat after the cabinet meeting that the government has decided to directly recruit 35 thousand soldiers in view of shortage of police force, which will be completed in the next few months
 isbharteeki khaas baat ye he ki isame likhit pariksha nahi lee jaayegi, ummidavaaron ke hiskool or intermediat main praapt ankon or shaareerik pariksha ke aadhaar par merit list banaakar bhartee kii jaaegi
 These soldiers can get a monthly salary of about 20 thousand
 isse sarkaar par lagbhag 80 karod rupee kaa masik kharchaa aayega
 It is worth mentioning that earlier the government had recruited 18,000 police constables on the basis of written examination but the matter has gone to court and the High Court had stopped the recruitment process by putting a question mark on the marker or whitener

 It is not known to which side the governments or the courts will float the camel of policies tomorrow morning, so it will be necessary to arrange policy risks in the business, even if the service or products become somewhat expensive
 ” yah jhunjhalaai hui tippanee ek bade niveshak kii thi jo haal main bharat main nitiyon kii anischitata ko bisur rahaa tha
 If the new year begins with resolutions, governments, courts, agencies, politicians should take a pledge against contingency and continuity in policies
 nitiyon kii anischitata keval udhyamiyon kii musiibat nahin he
 From young people to eager businessmen and ordinary consumers to retired to taking the next step, no one knows when the policy will change color and they will have to find a way to avoid its impact
 dilliki sadakon par od-even kaa niyam tay karte samay kya dilli sarkaar ne companiyon se poocha tha ki ve apane karmchaariyon kii awajahi ko kaise samyojit karengi? isse unke sanchaalan kaarobaar or videshi graahakon ko hone vaali asuvidhaon kaa kya hoga? badi dijal kaaron ko band karte hue kya supreme court ne yah samajhane kii koshish kii thi ki pichley paanch saal main auto companiyon ne dijal takanic main kitna nivesh kiya he
 After the arrival of the Modi government at the Center, investors who were celebrating Diwali in the market had no idea that they would get tax notices when they were expecting a new and permanent tax policy
 aise udaahranon kii fehrist lambii he jinhone bharat ko sarkari khataron se bharaa aisa desh bana diya he jahaan nitiyon kii karvaton kaa andaaj mausam ke anumaan se bhi kathin he
 Democracies are full of change but big countries also need visionary stability
 bharat is samay sarkari nitiyon ko lekar sabase jokhim bharaa desh ho chalaa he
 This confusion is compounded because the public did not leave any confusion in their mandate
 pichley do varshon ke lagbhag sabhijnadeshdo-took taur par sthaayee sarkaron ke paksh main rahe or jo paroksh rup se sarkaron se sthaayee or doordarshee nitiyon kii apeksha rakhte the
 However, be it new taxes like Swachh Bharat or the U-turn of the governments or the drastic changes in the moving policies, the whole governance is filled with a special kind of ad hocism
 gavarnence kaa yah tadarthwaad chaar staron par sakriy he or gahare nuksaan paidaa kar rahaa he
 First, the possible continuity in economic policies should be the most obvious, but there are changes in the policies related to income tax, service tax, industrial income tax
 jiesti ko lekar asamanjas sthaayee he
 Preparation of a new policy has started by showing a ready crate of changes in the Income Tax law (shom Committee)
 koyala, petroleum, doorsanchaar, banking jaise kuch aise kshetra hai jahaan agle sudhaaron kaa pataa nahin he
 Such uncertainty prevents investors from taking risks
 doosraa kshetra saamaajik nitiyon va sevaaon se judaa he, jahaan logon kii jindagi prabhavit ho rahi he
 For example, take the mobile call drop
 mobile network kharaab hone par companiyon par jurmaane kaa praavdhaan hua tha lekin companiyaan adaalat se ste le ain
 Now everything has stopped
 saamaajik kshetron main nirmaanadhin nitiyon kaa ant hi nahin dikhataa
 Today, if students want to plan their future, they do not know what will be the scenario of education in the coming five years or from which studies will get employment
 nitiyon kii anischitata ke tisare halake main ve anokhe you-turn hai jo nai sarkaron ne liye or phir safar ko bich main chhod main diya
 From Aadhaar card to the lack of law and lack of law, there is a large void of policies in areas such as rural employment because the policies of the previous government are closed and new ones are not made
 ek badi anischitata yojana ayog ke jane or nayaa vikalp na ban paane ko lekar ai he
 Which has created a huge vacuum between the ministries and the states on the sharing of expenses and monitoring of policies
 nitigat anischitata kaa chauthaa pahalu adaalatein hai, jo kisi samasya kevartmaan paranirnay sunaati hai lekin uske gahare asar bhavishya par hote hai
 If governments are ready with policies, perhaps the courts will not come to the executive role by giving orders like banning the sale of cars, reducing pollution, cleaning the rivers, giving food to the poor or reforming the police, but will give justice on rights
 bharat main aarthik udaarikaran or globaligeshan kaa ek puraa daur bitne ke baad gavarnence kii naseehaton ke saath dirghakaalin nitiyon kii jarurat thi
 But policy indecision has emerged due to the sluggish move of the government, U-turn on previous policies, petty pressures and political insistence and activism of courts
 congress kii das saal kii sarkaar ek khaas kism kii shithilataa se bhar gai thi lekin sudhaaron kii agali peedhishon kaa vaada karte hue satta main ai modi sarkaar nitiyon kaa asamanjas or asthirataa or badha degi, iskaa anumaan nahin tha
 Elections also take place in Western democracies
 vahaan rajnatik dalon ke vair bhi kamjor nahin hote lekin nitiyon kaa maahaul itnaa asthir nahin hota
 Even if the policies are changed, there is a long discussion with the affected parties, important decisions are not implemented like India
 nitigat doordarshita, samasyaon se sabase bada bachaav he
 But as the famous Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard used to say, there are two ways to be foolish
 ek jhooth par bharosa kiya jaae or doosraa sach par vishwaas na kiya jaae
 Due to the governance and policy obscurity of India, people are becoming foolish in both these ways
 kya nayaa saal hamen nitigat aakasmikta se nijaat dilaa paaegaa? sankalp karne main kya harj he

 Was able to achieve
 indian premier lig ke pehle teen toornamenton ke sabase mahange khilaadi rahe england ke kevin petersan ipel chaar kii nilaamee main flop sho sabit hue jabaki team india ke salaami ballebaaj gautam gambhir ne 24 lakh dollars (lagbhag 11 karod chaar lakh rupee) kii keemat ke saath sabhi ko peeche chhod nayaa ricard banaaya
 Indian players dominated the players' auction held on January 8 and 9 in Bangalore and most of them earned more than last season, while foreign players faced disappointment this time and many did not even get half of their previous price
 Could do it
 pichhali baar gambhir ko dilli dairedevills ne sirf saat lakh 25 hajaar dollars main kharida tha lekin is baar team india ke is salaami ballebaaj ke liye kolkata nite rides ne 24 lakh dollars kii boli lagaai
 This is more than their total earnings from the first three tournaments
 bharat ke jin khilaadiyon ko pichhali baar ke mukaable kaaphi adhik munafa hua unki fehrist kaaphi lambii he or isamen yusuf pathan, robin uthppa, rohit sharma or irfan pathan sareekhe khilaadi shaamil hai
 KKR also bid for Yusuf for $ 21 lakh, while his previous team Rajasthan Royals bought him for only $ 4,75,000 in the pre-ipl auction before the tournament, which means he was able to get a contract for almost four and a half times more 
 maujuuda satr main cricket se dur rahe alrounder irfan pathan ke liye dilli daire davills ne 19 lakh dollars kharch kiye jo 925000 dollars ke unke pichley ipel anubandh se dogune se bhi adhik he
 Not only this, young Indian cricketers also got a lot of money
 pichley teen satr main adhiktam 50 lakh rupee kaa anubandh hasil karne ke hakdaar saurabh tiwari or ravindra jadeja ko kramash: royal chalangers bangalore ne 16 lakh dollars (lagbhag saat karod 36 lakh rupee) or team kochi ne nau lakh 50 hajaar dollars (chaar karod 37 lakh rupee) main kharida
 On the other hand, foreign players were disappointed in the auction this time
 andrew flintaff ke saath pehle teen toornament ke sabase mahange khilaadi rahe petersan is baar chah lakh 50 hajaar dollars hi juta paye jo unke 15 lakh 50 hajaar dollars ke pichley anubandh kaa aadha bhi nahin he
 Peterson was bought by Deccan Chargers this time while last time he was part of RCB
 petersan ke alaava jis videshi khilaadi ko sabase adhik nuksaan hua vah austrailia ke andrew symonds or dakshin africa ke jepi dumini rahe
 Last time, for the Symonds sold for 1
3 million 50 thousand dollars, this time Mumbai Indians made the highest bid of 8 lakh 50 thousand, while Duminy could only get three lakh dollars
 dumini ko pichhali baar mumbai indians ne nau lakh 50 hajaar main kharida tha jo unki maujuuda keemat se teen guna se bhi adhik tha
 Last time, KKR bid for Australian fast bowler Brett Lee, who was sold for nine million dollars, and this time he sold at his reserve price of four million dollars
 itnaa hi nahin pichhali baar mumbai indians se nau lakh dollars kaa anubandh paane vaale srilanka ke sanath jayasoorya, westeindies ke kris gail (keker, aath lakh dollars), dakshin africa ke harshal gibs (deccan chargers, paanch lakh 75000 dollars) or mark bouchar (aaarasibi, chaar lakh 5 xxrep 4 0 dollars) ko to is baar koi kharidaar hi nahin mila
 But it is not the case that all the foreign players suffered
 srilanka ke mahela jayavardhane apni pichhali keemat se lagbhag teen guna hasil karne main safal rahe jabaki del sten ko lagbhag chaar guna paisa mila
 Jayawardene was last bought by Kings XI for four lakh 75 thousand dollars, while this time he joined Team Kochi for $ 1
5 million
 isi tarah aaarasibi ke saath pichhlaa anubandh 325000 dollars main karne vaale sten ke liye is baar deccan chargers ne 12 lakh dollars kharch kiye
 For Sri Lankan star spinner Muttiah Muralitharan, Kochi also spent $ 1
1 million, while his previous contract with Chennai Super Kings was $ 600,000
 isi tarah pichhali baar aaarasibi se paanch lakh dollars kaa anubandh paane vaale camerun white ko deccan se 11 lakh dollars kaa anubandh mila
 Not only this, Deccan was bought by Australia's unknown all-rounder Dan Christian for nine million dollars
 madhyapradesh ke badvani jile ke varala thana kshetra main pichley hafte bijepi netaa manoj thakare kii hatya ke maamle kaa police ne pardaafash karne kaa daawa kiya he
 According to police, senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader Tarachand Rathore Banjara committed the murder to maintain political supremacy
 police ke anusaar rathore kaa maananaa tha ki party main thakare kii vajah se uski haisiyat kam ho rahi he
 Tarachand Rathore gave a contract of five lakh rupees to Anil of Bistan village to get Manoj out of the way and killed him
 is hatyakand main bijepi netaa tarachand rathore, anil or uske saat saathiyon ko police ne giraftaar kar liya gaya he
 The BJP had given a memorandum regarding the law and order of the state at the state level and at the district headquarters regarding this massacre

 The title is '14-year-old girl married to 52-year-old lawyer: Court'
 isaki sabaheding main likhaa gaya he ki 'bombai hoicourt ne kaha he ki ham yuvati kaa bhala dekh rahe hai ab samaaj main koi or use patni ke rup main sweekaar nahin karegaa
 'this news printed on the front page of the Hindu calendar in the country, which is considered infamous for child marriage, makes us think
 bal vivaah ke tamaam kanoonon, praavdhaanon or abhiyaanon ke bich yah nirnay ek vyakti kaa jivan bachaane ke liye bhale hi is shaadi ko vaid qaraar de rahaa ho, lekin aap sochie ki is nirnay kaa sandesh kya jane vaala he? kya court main jaakar us shaadi ko vaazib tehraakar hi ladki kaa bhavishya bachaana ekmaatr vikalp tha yaa iske koi or raste bhi the, sochaa janaa chahie
 Two days ago i went to a district court of Madhya Pradesh to participate in a debate on child marriage
 is baatcheet main nyaay vyavastha se jude log bhi shaamil the
 Since the court was complex and people associated with the judicial system were also present in front of me, i felt it necessary to present a figure presented in Lok Sabha
 isamen bataaya gaya tha ki varsh 2014 se lekar 2016 tak ke teen saalon main desh main bal vivaah ke 849 maamle darj kiye gaye the in 849 maamalon main se keval 35 maamalon main hi dosha siddh ho sakaa
 During the same period, cases were registered in 33 cases of child marriage inside Madhya Pradesh
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki ek bhi maamle main aarope siddh nahin ho sakaa
 Didn't the child get married or did we fall behind in proving guilty
 haalanki maine iske jawaab die jane kii apeksha nahin kii thi, par bataaya gaya ki bal vivaah pratishedh adhinium or iske tahat kiye gaye praavdhaanon kaa mul uddeshy sajaa dena nahin balki bal vivaah ke prati jaagrukta paidaa karnaa he
 Surprised by my question in the auditorium, it was more shocking than listening to the answer, because because of the data scattering and looking at the ground reality, i think it is a very serious subject and if the Government of India has set sustainable development goals Assuming the commitment, it has been said that by 2010, the practice of child marriage will be completely abolished in the country, will it really end like this? Nkde National Family Health Survey issued
 iske mutabik desh main ab bhi takreeban 26 pratishat bacchon ke vivaah tay umr se kam main ho rahe hai
 When the third survey came out 15 years ago, this figure was around 57 percent
 kya yah aankada chota he
 Look at the data from another source, which comes in the form of numbers, so that you will be able to recognize its magnitude
 desh ke sabase bade surveykshan janaganana 2011 main paaya gaya ki desh main takreeban ek karod 21 lakh bacchon ke bal vivaah hue
 About nine lakh children were found inside Madhya Pradesh, who were married at the time of census
 vivaah ke baad ladkiyaan maa bhi ban gayi or hairaani kii baat to yah ki talaak yaa vidhwaa bhi ho gayi
 Think if this is not a direct violation of child rights
 bal adhikaar samjhaute ke tees saal hone ja rahe hai
 In these thirty years, what right understanding has been made about our child rights
 bal vivaah ke maamle main to jo samaj bani he usase main chakit rah gaya
 Last year while we were wandering in Rajgarh district while investigating the field of child marriage in Madhya Pradesh, we found something else there
 rajgad bal vivaah or naataraa pratha ke liye samvedansheel mana jaataa he
 When we were disappointed to see a child married couple in the temple, we reached out to local journalist colleagues
 unhone bataaya ki ab puraa maamla badal gaya he
 Now after marriage, the couple does not come to the temple because they come to know that outsiders are also coming at this time, and the administration is also alert
 isliye aisa nahin hua ki bal vivaah band kar die gaye iske ulat ab log aise duurastha ilaakon main jaakar shaadi karte hai jahaan prashasan or media pahunch na sake
 Such marriages often take place at night and also visit temples a few days later
 hamen laga ki yadi maamla itnaa gambhir he to phir shaayad yah maamla itnaa chota nahin he
 It will not be completed by taking some success stories
 vah rasaadaaygi se bhi puraa nahin hone vaala
 If such news will come from the court as it appears today, then believe us, our hands will tremble in making a report on this matter for the Sustainable Development Goals in 2030

 Amid growing speculation in the Valley over some potentially major decisions regarding the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, former Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti said on Friday that the matter has now crossed over and that India has preferred land rather than people
 mahabuuba ne pradhanmantri narendra modi se apil kii ki vah rajya ke vishesh darjen ke saath chhedchhad naa karen
 He said that the results of such a step would not be good
 mahabuuba ne anya partiyon ke netaaon ke saath shuukravaar raat ko rajyapal satyapal malik se mulaakaat kii or unase un 'afvaahon ko khaarij karne kaa anurodh kiya jisase ghati main bhay kaa maahaul paidaa ho gaya he' unhone kaha ki aisa lagata he ki apni vishisht pahchaan kii raksha ke liye jo kuch bhi baaki bachaa he, use bharat, jammu kashmir kii janata se 'balpurvak chin'ne kii taiyaari main he
 The PDP president tweeted, 'AAP failed to win the love of a single Muslim-majority state, which rejected discrimination on religious grounds and chose secular India
 ab maamla aar-paar kaa ho chukaa he or bharat ne janata ke badale jameen ko tarjeeh di he
 You failed to win over the love of a single Muslim majority state which rejected division on religious grounds & chose secular India
 The gloves are finally off & India has chosen territory over people
 He said in another tweet, that (the founder of the PDP and two-time chief minister), Mufti (mohammad Saeed) Saheb always used to say that whatever the Kashmiris get, they will get from their own country India
 lekin aaj aisa lagata he ki apni vishisht pahchaan kii raksha ke liye unke paas jo kuch bhi bachaa tha, yahi desh unase vah balpurvak chhinane kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 Mufti sahab would always say that whatever kashmiris will get, it will be from their own country India
 But today the same country seems to be preparing to rob them of whatever little is left to protect their unique identity
 Addressing a press conference at his residence in the evening, he said that if the Prime Minister wants to win the hearts and minds of the people of Kashmir by talking about 'insaniyat, Jamhooriyat, Kashmiriyat', then why is such an atmosphere being created where people His identity seems to be in danger
 mahabuuba ne kaha, 'mujhe bharosa he ki desh ke log jammu kashmir ke logon ko chaahate hai naa ki keval bhoomi
 But the situation is such that it seems that you consider Jammu and Kashmir to be the issue of the region
 puraa kshetra pehle se hi aapke saath he
 He said that Jammu and Kashmir is the only Muslim majority state which in difficult times rejected the two-nation theory on the condition that it joined a secular and democratic India to protect its unique identity
 mahabuuba ne kaha ki vah is mudde par sahmati banane ke liye ghati main anya raajnneetik dalon ke netaaon se mulaakaat karegi or ekajute hokar ladaai ladengi, samvaadadaata sammelan ke baad unhone nekan adhyaksh faruk abdulla, pipuls conference netaa sajaad lone or imran ansaari, jammu kashmir pipuls movement ke netaa shah faisal se mulaakaat kii

 Modi has written a letter in this matter
 khat ke zarie modi ne esaity ke saamne pesh nahin hone kii vajah bataai he
 Modi also said that whenever he is called, he will be present
 isse pehle ye khabar ai thi ki purv congress saansad ehsaan jafari kii patni zakia jafari kii arji par esaity ne modi ko poochtacha ke liye 21 march ko bulaayaa he
 But when Modi did not appear on March 21, various speculations began to be made on this
 ab modi ke khule khat se is maamle main twist aa gaya he
 Narendra Modi may be refusing to get the summons himself, but he is only speaking half truth in this matter
 sachai yah he ki 11 march ko esaity ne modi ko notice bhejkar poochtacha ke liye haazir hone ko kaha tha
 Keeping in mind that Modi is the Chief Minister, the SIT had asked him to choose any date after 21 March according to his convenience and inform him about it
 mukhyamantri ke daphtar ne is samman kii pavati bhi bheji thi
 But after that no information was given to SIT
 ab aise main modi kitna sach bol rahe hai ye koi bhi samaj saktaa he

 Former Union Human Resource Development Minister and senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal said on Sunday that the Parliament (parliament) has now become a theater
 sibbal ne madhyapradesh kii rajdhani main 'samvidhan or deshbhakti' par yojit tok-sho main hissaa liya or vahaan se congress daftar gaye
 During the discussion with reporters, he said, earlier what we used to see in the theater (drama), now it is seen in Parliament
 sansad vah jagah he, jahaan aise muddon par charchaa honi chahie, jisase desh aage bad sake
 He further said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is pursuing the agenda of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)
 vah ab bhi desh ke pradhanmantri ke taur par nahin, balki sangh ke prachaarak kii tarah hi kaam kar rahe hai
 Sibal said, he will not be seen from the perspective of the Prime Minister of the country, i am worried about this
 unhone congress par kiye ja rahe shabdic hamalon or upyog main laai ja rahi 'bhashaa' par bhi sawaal uthaaya or kaha ki desh ko aage badhanaa he to hamen apane samvidhan ko apnaanaa hoga
 Also, such rhetoric has to be stopped and worked in the interest of the country and not for its political gains
 jeenyu main lagaae gaye kathith desh virdohi naaron ke baad kii karrwai ko lekar kiye gaye sawaal par sibbal ne kaha, vahaan jo kuch hua, vah samvidhan ke mutabik tha yaa nahin, yah nyaayalay tay karegaa, lekin main itnaa jarur kahuunga ki vishvavidhyalay main police bhejnaa thik nahin he
 He further said that the BJP has decided that till the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) becomes effective in every university, it will not get rest
 sibbal ne kaha ki chaatro ko apni baat kehane kaa haq nahin dena, unhen pakadaney ke liye police bhejnaa galat he
 By not giving the chancellor of the university to improve the situation, if the government is able to improve it, then it is an attack on the university system
 unhone aage kaha ki chaatr agar apane man kii baat nahin kahenge, vichaar vyakt nahin karenge to vishvavidhyalayon kaa auchity hi khatm ho jayega
 University means students to put their thoughts in front of everyone, you may not like it
 vahaan baat vishvavidhyalay str par hona chahie na ki sarkaar bich main aae or deshadroh kaa mukadmaa chalaae
 On the question asked about the state's much talked about Professional Examination Board (vyapam) scam, Sibal said that he did not think that the CBI investigation was going on in this case
 agar jaanch chal rahi hoti to sibiai ko jo dastaveji pramaan saunpe gaye hai, un par ab tak koi kargar karrwai kyon nahin kii gai
 The comments unhone kaha ki sibiai ko original exelshit or tepe saunpe ja chuke hai, jinamein kai logon ke naam bhi hai, magar ab tak unamem se kisi kii bhi sibiai ne giraftaar nahin kii he
 Sibal further said, after 2019, the country will see how the CBI investigation takes place

 is samay sibiai puri tarah bhaajapa sarkaar ko bachaane kaa kaam kar rahi he
 He also questioned the literal attacks being made on the Congress and the 'language' being used and said that if the country has to move forward, we have to adopt our Constitution
 saath hi is tarah kii bayaanbaji ko rokna hoga or desh ke hit main kaam karnaa hoga, na ki apane raajnneetik laabh ke liye
 Asked about the action taken after the alleged anti-national slogans imposed in JNU, Sibal said, "whatever happened there was according to the constitution or not, this court will decide, but i would definitely say that sending police to the university not right
 unhone aage kaha ki bhaajapa ne tay kar liya he ki jab tak har vishvavidhyalay main akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad (abivipi) prabhavi nahin ho jaati he, tab tak use chaiyn nahin milegaa
 Sibal said that it is wrong to send students to the police to nab them, not to give their right to speak
 vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati ko halaat sudhaarney kaa mauka nahin dekar sarkaar hi use sudhaarney main lag jaae to yah uniwarsity system par akraman he
 He further said that if students do not say their mind, do not express their views, then the justification of the universities will end
 vishvavidhyalay kaa arth he chaatro dwaara apane khayalaat ko sabake saamne rakhana, ho saktaa he yah aapako pasand na aae
 There should be talk at the university level, not that the government should come in and prosecute treason
 rajya ke bahucharchit vyavsaayik pariksha mandal (vyaapman) ghotaale ko lekar puche gaye sawaal par sibbal ne kaha ki unhen to nahin lag rahaa ki is maamle kii sibiai jaanch chal rahi he
 If the investigation was going on then why no effective action has been taken against the documentary evidence that has been handed over to the CBI
 tippaniyan He said that the original excelsheet and tapes have been handed over to the CBI, which also has the names of many people, but so far none of them have been arrested by the CBI
 sibbal ne aage kaha, varsh 2019 ke baad desh dekhegaa ki sibiai jaanch kisi hoti he
 At present, the CBI is working completely to save the BJP government
 jeenyu main lagaae gaye kathith desh virdohi naaron ke baad kii karrwai ko lekar kiye gaye sawaal par sibbal ne kaha, vahaan jo kuch hua, vah samvidhan ke mutabik tha yaa nahin, yah nyaayalay tay karegaa, lekin main itnaa jarur kahuunga ki vishvavidhyalay main police bhejnaa thik nahin he
 He further said that the BJP has decided that till the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) becomes effective in every university, it will not get rest

 Terry Walsh was replaced by new head coach Paul Van Ace about a month ago
 nae coach ke aane ke baad se nishchit rup se bhartiya team kaa yah pradarshan uske liye utsaah badhaane vaala hoga
 For Van Ace, India's third place finish is a relatively good start
 vaan es ke coach banane ke baad se bhartiya team kaa yah pehla toornament tha
 India had earlier played a 1–1 draw with Korea in the league stage
 ravivaar ke match se pehle bharat ne shanivaar ko ajalan shah stadium main vishwa vijeta or toornament ke gat vijeta australia ko 4-2 se haraakar chaunkaa diya tha
 For India, both goals were field goals by Nikin Thimmaiah (10th minute) and Satbir Singh (22nd) while South Korea scored both goals on penalty corners by Yo Hyosik (20th) and Nam Hyunwu (29th)

 baithak ke baad mukherjee ne kaha ki dwipaksheeya sahyog ke masale par donon netaaon ke saath unki baatcheet upyogi rahi
 Afghan Foreign Minister Spanta, without naming Pakistan, said that both countries are facing terrorism from the same source
 aise donon deshon ke bich ye samajhadaari badi he ki aatankwaad se mukaable ke liye suraksha or soochnaaon ke hastantaran main aapasi sahyog badhaayaa jaae
 Senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy once again said that the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya will start soon and devotees can go there till next Diwali
 shanivaar raat mumbai main ‘raamarajy’ vishay par yojit ek vyaakhyaan main unhone kaha, ‘‘ham agali diwali ram mandir main manaayenge
 The Ram temple in Ayodhya will be almost ready by October next year, as everything is ready and all the materials for construction are already in place
 use keval jodna he, jaisaa swami narayan mandir ke maamle main hua tha
 The BJP leader said ahead of the December 5 hearing of the Ramjanmabhoomi Babri Masjid case that the Allahabad High Court had already looked into the matter to a great extent and there was nothing left for the Sunni Waqf Board to argue against it
 unhone kaha, ‘‘maine ek atirikt daleel di he ki us sthaan par prarthana karnaa meraa or hindu samudaay kaa moolbhoot adhikaar he
 Muslims do not have that right
 unki ruchi sirf sampatti main he, jo ek saamaanya baat he
 The BJP leader said that there is no need to enact a new law for the construction of Ram temple
 unhone daawa kiya ki tatkaaleen narsingh raav sarkaar ne supreme court main daayar ek halafname main kaha tha ki agar yah sthapit ho jaataa he ki sthaan par ek mandir tha, to jameen mandir ke nirmaan ke liye de di jaaegi
 He is now proved
 isse pehle patna main ek samaaroh ko sambodhit karte hue swami ne kaha tha ki ram mandir kii raah main ai rukaawaton ko dur kiya ja rahaa he
 Construction work will be started soon
 agle hafte ham log diwali manaane vaale hai, lekin agali diwali tak ram mandir shraddhaluon ke liye puja ke liye uplabdh hoga
 He said that no one can get votes only by talking about development
 chunavi kamyaabi ke liye hindutv ko bhi yaad rakhana jaruri he
 At the same time, after bjp's blistering victory in the UP civic elections, there has been speculation whether the way for the construction of Ram temple has been cleared now
 On the one hand, this matter is in the Supreme Court, on the other hand the BJP MP has given rise to new speculation by linking bjp's victory in the body elections with Ram Mandir
 isse pehle yogi ndhyodhya main diwalike din puja kar bhagwaan ram kaa aashirwad liya tha, lekin aaj ayodhya kii janata ne bhi nikaay chunaav main bijepi pratyaashee ke maathe par jeet kaa tikaa lagaakar yogi kii jholii bhar di

 -yogiadityanath, mukhyamantri, uttar pradesh(21 agast, 2017 ko saharanpur main apane ek bhaashan main)ganga-yamuna kaa doaab in dinon pani-pani he
 Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh is situated amidst this water
 ise aap upi kaa pehla yaa antim jila bhi kah sakate hai
 It separates the Yamuna from Haryana, the mountains from Himachal Pradesh and the mountains and the Ganges from Uttarakhand
 saharanpur kaa itihaas sajhi samskruti kaa rahaa he, lekin ab jaateey hinsa or rajnatik gatividhiyaan isaki pahchaan ban gai hai
 In 'airtime Politics', this district is now a subject of national debate, which sometimes starts on the issue of ethnic conflict and sometimes focuses on the issue of Mayawati's resignation
 sabase bada sawaal yah he ki saare rajnatik dalon kaa focus saharanpur hi kyon he? sawaal isliye ahm hekhyonki saharanpur main rajnatik prayogon se jaateey rasayanon main kai baar ubaal aayaa, jo bavaal kaa kaaran bane
 In fact, a series of incidents of ethnic violence in Shabbirpur village on 5 May and ethnic violence on 9 and 23 May made Saharanpur the center of national discussion
 basapa supremeo mayawati ain or shanti kii apil karke chali gayi, lekin unke jate hi phir hinsa bhadak gai
 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi also came but he was returned from the Saharanpur border itself
 jile par rashtriya siyaasi dalon kaa focus teen saal purana he
 The 2014 Lok Sabha election campaign was started by the BJP from this district and by winning the Lok Sabha seat, he started making a dent in the BSP fort
 2016 main bhaajapa ne vidhansabha chunaav abhiyaan kii shuruyaat bhi centre sarkaar ke do saal puure hone par pradhanmantri narendra modi kii saharanpur main raily se hi kii thi
 After this, BJP President Amit Shah left from here in November 2016 with a Parivartan Yatra
 sankshep main yahi ve baaten or shakhsiyat hai jinaki vajah se 'airtime politics main saharanpur 'prime time' par bana hua he, lekin rajnatik makasad hasil karne ke liye hinsa yahaan pehali baar dekhi gai
 The latest political developments are the results of the assembly elections, in which the BSP, which held four of the seven seats in Saharanpur, was reduced to zero by the BJP in 2017
 bhaajapa or basapa kii yah ladaai yahaan kareeb do dashak puraani he
 In 1998, the then BSP supremo Kanshi Ram was contested from the Saharanpur Lok Sabha seat by Mayawati, but bjp's fake Singh defeated him by giving the slogan 'kanshiram harao-khet Bachao'
 mayawati chaiyn se nahin baithi or unhone 'cast chemistry' kaa daanv khelte hue 1999 main mansoor ali khan ko chunaav ladaakar bhaajapa se yah seat jeet lee thi
 Later also Mayawati depended on this cast chemistry
 unhone yaheen ke siyaasi prayog ko pradesh bhar main aajamaaya or mukhyamantri baniin
 Mayawati twice won elections from her own Harauda Safer (now Rampur Maniharan) seat, but this time the BJP wrested this reserved seat from the BSP
 jaahir he, ab yah siyaasi ladaai bahut najdiki ho gai he
 The challenge is to stand again in front of the BSP and to retain success in front of the BJP
 saharanpur se paanch baar loksabhaa sadsy rahe basapa netaa or purv kendriya mantri kaaji rashid masood kehete hai, ''bhaajapa or aresas ranneeti ke tahat yah prachaarit kar rahe hai ki dalit vot bhaajapa ke saath aa rahaa he jabaki dalit vot basapa se alag nahin he
 BSP 22 in the 2017 assembly elections
 8 fisadi vot mili, jo vishuddh rup se daliton ke hai
 People belonging to other caste and religion were kept away from the BSP under a conspiracy
 '' bhaajapa kii tarah congress ne bhi saharanpur main send lagaai he or vah har us koshish main lagi he, jisase dalit uske saath jud saken
 Masood says, "the Congress conspiracy also got a message from the BJP that Dalit votes can be broken and she too jumped into the game
 ''kareeb 34 lakh aabaadi vaale is jile main daliton or musalamaanon kii taadaad 22 lakh se zyada he
 There are also 14 Muslims
 6 lakh he
 For this reason, political parties are using this district as a laboratory
 shabbirpur jaisi jaateey hinsa or bhim army jaise gaiyr rajnatik dal ke udai ne siyaasi dalon ko khulkar khilne kaa mauka de diya

 The Chairman of the Department of Political Science at Jain Degree College, Dr
 virendra kumaar sharma 'shammi' kaa maananaa he, ''dalit utpeeda kii ghatnaayen deshbhar main pratik banakar ubharne lagi hai
 Political parties and their supporters do not readily accept political change
 vipaksh majboot nahin he or majbootee ke lieek hona padegaa
 The sacrifice that Ekta wants to sacrifice cannot be given by the opposition
 '' saharanpur main vipaksh ke naam par badi party congress he or pradesh upaadhyaksh imran masood khulkar bhim army kaa samarthan kar chuke hai
 Imran Masood, who won two mlas in the assembly elections, is the Congress here
 2019 main saharanpur loksabhaa seat se priyanka gandhi ke chunaav ladgaye kii charchaaon se ve utsahit najar aate hai
 "saharanpur is a very quiet district," says Masood, but BJP MP Raghav Lakhanpal Sharma spoiled the atmosphere on April 20 by forcibly taking out an Ambedkar procession at Road Dudhli
 loktantr main baat rakhane kaa haq sabko he, lekin bhaajapa satta kaa durupyog kar vipakshi dalon par haaavee hone kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 We talk of social unity
 sochna to unako he jo shmashaan, kabristaan, id or diwaali ko lekar vaimnasy failaane vaale bayaan de rahe hai
 "BJP MP Raghav Lakhanpal Sharma does not agree with Imran's words at all
 ve kehete hai, ''imran masood kis bhashaa kaa prayog karte hai, yah 2014 main puri duniya dekh chuki he
 If the mass base of BJP is increasing then it is a sign that the people are rejecting non-bjp parties
 ham sabko saath lekar sabake vikaas kii baat karte hai
 "now the question is how much energy will the opposition be able to generate in Saharanpur?" BSP is zero in Saharanpur today
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav se pehle hi uske vidhayak dharm singh saini (nakud) or mahavir rana (behat) bhaajapa main chale gaye the
 The SP, BSP and Congress are the three big political forces in the opposition and even if they become one at the national and state level, it is not possible at the local level
 loksabhaa seat par 9 baar congress, 3 baar bhaajapa, 2 baar janata party, do baar janata dal, ek baar samaajawaadee party or do baar bahujan samaaj party chunaav jiti hai
 The BSP has dominated the assembly elections for most of the two decades
 jaahir he ki jeet kaa swaad sabko yaad he, lekin saharanpur main chunauti ke rup main ise sirf basapa or congress le rahi he
 Mayawati's resignation from the Rajya Sabha on Shabbirpur violence is a great example of this
 basapa shjiroy se shuru kar rahi he
 Changing its tendency, it is becoming agitational again
 daliton ke saath gaiyr dalit 'conect' ko viksit kar rahi he
 In view of the change of villages and Dalits, the support of new communication tools and social media is increasing
 sabaki najar daliton or gaiyr bhaajapa dalon kii musalamaanon par he
 The SP, BSP and Congress want to attract Muslims by showing Dalits with them
 jabaki bhaajapa apane paramparaagat voton ke saath daliton ko jodpha chaahati he or iskaa prayog vah loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav main kar chuki he
 The concern of the BSP is to hold these votes and to put other votes in them and this is also the problem of making Saharanpur a political lab
 safed magar matamaili ho chuki is murti ko dekh kar laga ki ambedkar kii he
 Shocked mind was watching who could be the last one, who is standing with pad and bat on the way to the eighty ghats of Benares

 mujhe nahin maaloom ki kin logon ne yah murti lagaai or lagane kaa itihaas kya he magar banaras ke itihaas ke is safed panne ko dekh miaz harihar ho gaya
 i don't know much about Vijji but Vijji renewed Banaras for me
 jo log banaras ko jaanane kaa daawa karte hai darasal wo banaras ke bare main utana hi jaanate hai

 After the Lok Sabha elections, now the political board of Maharashtra Assembly elections is being laid
 sattadhari bijepi-shivasena aam chunaav ke tarj par hi is baar ke vidhansabha chunaav main milakar congress-ensipi kaa muqabla karengi
 For this, the seat-sharing between the bjp-shiv Sena alliance remains, but the formula for the Chief Minister's post between the two parties is still not decided
 bataa den ki loksabhaa chunaav main maharashtra main bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan ne shandaar safalataa darj kii
 However the story does not end here, but begins
 kuch hi maheene baad soobe main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav tak is gathbandhan ko barkaraar rakhte hue aisi hi safalataa ko dohraane kii badi chunauti he
 For this, the seat sharing formula is already decided between the two parties
 maharashtra kii kul 288 vidhansabha siton main se bijepi-shivasena donon dal baraabar-baraabar siton par chunaav ladenge
 This means that Shiv Sena will try its luck in 144 seats and BJP in 144 seats
 lekin mukhyamantri pad ke liye baari-baari se dhai-dhai saal yaa jise zyada siten mili uskaa siem ho, inamen se kisi bhi formule par koi sahmati nahin bani he
 In an interview to India Today, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said that i do not think we are going to back out of this agreement
 ham donon hi achche se samaj chuke hai or hamane ab man bana liya he ki saath milakar chunaav ladenge
 Our first goal is to win 220 out of 288 seats in the assembly elections
 mukhyamantri ke pad ke formule par devendra fadanvis ne kaha ki jahaan tak mukhyamantri pad kii baat he to mujhe nahin lagata he ki ham kisi bhi formule ke liye raji hue hai ki yah dhai-dhai saal hoga yaa chunaav main jise zyada siten aati hai, use mukhyamantri milegaa
 We will decide when the time comes
 siem fadanvis ke bayaan ke baad saaf he ki mukhyamantri pad ke kisi formule par abhi tak shivasena or bijepi ke bich koi sahmati nahin bani hui he or chunaav nattejey ke baad hi is sawaal kaa hal donon dal talash karenge
 Actually, bjp-shiv Sena contested in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, but only after a few months, there was so much tension in the state assembly elections that the 25-year-old alliance was broken
 donon dal alag-alag vidhansabha chunaav lade
 BJP got 122 seats and Shiv Sena 63 seats
 iske baad donon dalon ne milakar rajya main sarkaar banaai thi
 In fact, before 2014 in the state of Maharashtra, Shiv Sena has been behaving like bjp's elder brother in the state
 isi kaa nateeja he ki soobe kii kul 288 vidhansabha siton main se 171 siton par shivasena or 117 siton par bijepi ladati rahi
 Shiv Sena used to fight in more seats, then won more seats
 haalanki ladi gai siton par jeet kaa pradarshan bijepi kaa hi behatar rahata tha
 But due to the total number of seats left behind, BJP used to fall behind in the claim of Chief Minister
 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav se pehle bijepi barabari kii siton par ladakar adhik siten jeetne vaale ko mukhyamantri pad dene kii maang par ad gai
 As a result, the alliance broke
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main maharashtra kii siyasat bijepi kaa graph badhane ke baad shivasena bhi is baat ko bakhubi samaj chuki he ki baraabar-baraabar siton ke formule par chunaav ladakar apni takat kaa ehsaas karen

 In reply, spinner Abdur Razzaq took three wickets for 25 runs
 dakshin africa team 184 ran par simat gai
 Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons said it would be difficult to defeat South Africa but his team would get the benefit of playing on their own soil

 Two flats in three have been bought in the name of Mallya as well as his then minor daughter Tanya

 congress kii antarim adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne guuruuvaar ko apni puri team se mulaakaat kar party ke sadsyta abhiyaan, prashikshan modul tathaa mahatma gandhi kii 150veen jayanti manaane kii yojanaon ke bare main charchaa kii
 By the way, it can be easily predicted that no matter what the Congress plans today, the BJP trying to include Mahatma Gandhi in the category of 'their worshipers' will be defeated, because they have a comprehensive plan for the occasion first
 Is ready from vichaar-vimarsh ke liye kii gai aaj kii baithak main party mahasachiv or uttar pradesh kii prabharee priyanka gandhi wadra shaamil thim, lekin unke bhai or purv party pramukh rahul gandhi nadaarad the
 After a few weeks, Team Sonia is not keen on making any comments about the assembly elections going to be held in the three states - Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand
 congress ko sadsyta abhiyaan kii zarurat isse zyaada kabhi nahin rahi - kyonki maharashtra main to kai netaa ek ke baad ek party se baahar nikal gaye hai
 These include filmstar Urmila Matondkar, who had joined the party just five months earlier, and while leaving, termed 'ochiha internal politics' as the reason for her decision
 naaraazgi kaa muzahiraa us samay bhi bahut saaf-saaf hua, jab congress kii mumbai ikai ke purv pramukh milind devda or unase pehle mumbai congress ke mukhiya rahe sanjay nirupam ne soshal media par ek duusare par jamkar hamale kiye
 By the way, social media has now become the new and favorite ground of congress-e-jung - in fact, the party does not have the workers to take any fight to the ground
 nirupam ne ek saakshaatkaar main NDTV se kaha tha ki party maharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav haar jaaegi
 Such friends lived
 beshak, vah galat nahin kah rahe hai
 The BJP is fully prepared to take on the Congress in all three states, but there is no preparation for the Congress, as the party leaders in all the three states are busy in throwing mud at each other
 kaaphi uthapatak ke baad bhupendra singh hooda ko chunaav cameti pramukh ke taur par haryana kaa prabhaar diya gaya he, lekin unke kareebi netaaon kaa kahana he ki ab kaaphi der ho chuki he, or vah bhi asar daalane main kaamyaab nahin ho paaenge
 He gives the example of Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, who had been adopting a rebellion a year before the election, to ensure that he gets complete freedom in the context of assembly elections
 ek ore jahaan BJP or amit shah is baat kii yojana bana rahe hai ki maharashtra main sahyogi dal shivasena ko naaraaz kiye bina badi party banakar kaise ubharen, or saath hi yah bhi jataa diya jaae ki 'bos' koun he, vahiin congress ab tak sirf sharad pavaar ke saath seat-bantwaare ko antim rup de pai he
 This was also done when Sharad Pawar spoke to Sonia Gandhi and warned that till the agreement is reached, leaders from both parties will not stop going to BJP
 pavaar bilkul sahi the
 Kripa Shankar Singh, who has been called the North Indian face of Congress in Maharashtra politics after Urmila Matondkar, has also left the party, and is now planning to join the BJP
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki pavaar khud bhi thakare parivaar kii donon shakhaon - uddhav tathaa raaj - ko yah samajhane main vyast hai ki amit shah se sabase phydemand 'samjhauta' kaise kiya ja saktaa he
 He is probably doing this because he thinks that the time spent in pursuing the winning team's strategy will be more useful than spending time in alliance negotiations with Congress
 team sonia ne kaaryakartaaon or netaaon ke liye training modul par baat zarur kii, lekin party main sheersh par maujuud vaicharik shunya behad spasht nazar aata he
 The Congress does not know where it stands today, because its leaders are leaving positions publicly
 RSS kii vyavastha kii nakal karnaa bhi unke liye rambaan siddh nahin ho saktaa
 The RSS worker believes in a very clearly defined ideology, but the Congress worker does not have this facility
 yahaan tak ki kashmir main kiye gaye shatdown tathaa faruk or umr abdulla jaise mukhyadhara ke netaaon ko hiraasat main liye jane kaa virodh bhi congress kii ore se bahut kam rahaa, or vah bhi party ke soshal media handlon tak hi simit rahaa
 Former Finance Minister P
 chidambaram tathaa karnataka ke party netaa di
 K
 sivakumar kii giraftaar kaa virodh bhi behad kamazor rahaa
 Neither of the two were discussed in today's meeting
 narendra modi sarkaar ke rahete CBI or ED jaisi jaanch agenciyon or kar vibhaag ke behad sakriy hone kaa sonia gandhi se zyaada virodh to pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne kiya he
 a Congress leader said to me, "even in the face of the daily bad news, the economy has sunk, there was no protest from our side
 
 
 is mudde par hamen puri takat ke saath virodh jataane kii zarurat thi, logon ko naukariyon kii killat ke bare main bataane kii zarurat thi, lekin is mudde par ek baar dow manmohan singh ke baat karne ke baad ham bilkul chup ho gaye
 
 
 "while affirming the crisis, party treasurer Ahmed Patel also warned state units and candidates that the acute shortage of funds meant that they would have to help themselves in the elections
 aaj kii baithak main is par bhi charchaa nahin kii gai
 In the current situation of the Congress, it seems like the party has met today's meeting with an agenda that will not only baffle its rivals but also its own leaders
 isse pehle, kabhi bhi party apni yaa desh kii zaruuraton ko lekar itani kati-kati kabhi mahasoos nahin hui thi
