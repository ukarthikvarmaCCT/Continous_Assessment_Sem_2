 In winter, there are many choices of fruits and vegetables
 apni diet main papeeta, gaajar, tamaato, paalak or duusare mausami falon-subjiyon ko shaamil karen
 Apart from this, the body can be kept warm naturally by using ginger, garlic, black pepper, cinnamon

 Avoid consumption of cold things

 There is a lot of speculation behind the silence observed by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on the third consecutive victory of Chief Minister Narendra Modi in Gujarat and this stance is also linked to the 2010 Bihar Assembly elections, in which the Chief Minister of Gujarat Did not congratulate Nitish Kumar on his victory at the time
 mukhyamantri ke kareebi sutron ne bataaya ki 2010 main bihar vidhansabha chunaavon main nitish kumaar ko baari jeet mili thi, lekin iske liye narendra modi ne koi badhai nahin di thi
 Perhaps Nitish Kumar's stance is also in response to his well thought out strategy
 unhone kaha ki modi kii lagaataar teesri baar jeet haalanki koi choti-moti jeet nahin he, lekin 2010 main bihar main vidhansabha chunaavon main nitish kumaar ke netritv main ummidavaaron kii jeet kaa pratishat 85 tha
 Even then, sources said, Narendra Modi did not directly or indirectly congratulate Nitish Kumar
 bijepi or jediu gathbandhan ne argedy supremeo lalu prasad, congress or lojpa ko dhul chataate hue 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav main 243 siton main se 206 main jeet hasil kii thi
 With the silence of Nitish Kumar, many kinds of speculations are being made now

 After an official event on Friday, when a response was sought on Narendra Modi's historic victory in Gujarat, he (nitish) left for another meeting without saying anything
 guuruuvaar ko bhi mukhyamantri ne gujarat ke sambandh main koi pratikriya dene se inkaar kiya tha
 Nitish Kumar's mysterious silence was not liked by jdu's ally BJP leaders
 kai netaa is par aashcharya jataa rahe hai
 BJP state president CP Thakur said on Nitish's silence that he is wondering why the chief minister is silent? It is normal that each other is congratulated on victory
 narendra modi ke kattar samarthak or nitish sarkaar main pashu evam matsay sansaadhan mantri giriraaj singh ne kaha, badhai dena ek saamaanya prakriya he

 Sources close to the chief minister said that Nitish Kumar had a landslide victory in the Bihar assembly elections in 2010, but for this Narendra Modi did not congratulate him
 sambhavat: nitish kumaar kaa rukh bhi sochi-samajhi ranneeti ke tahat uske jawaab main he
 He said that though Modi's third consecutive victory is not a trivial victory, in the Bihar Assembly elections in 2010, the percentage of victory of the candidates led by Nitish Kumar was 85
 sutron ne kaha, tab bhi narendra modi ne pratyaksh yaa paroksh taur par nitish kumaar ko badhai nahin di thi

 According to the Reserve Bank of India, no deadline has been set for introducing Sharia (islamic banking) or interest-free banking in the country
 islamic yaa sharia banking aisi vittiya vyavastha he jo byaaj nahin lene ke siddhanton par aadhaarit he
 Interest is banned in Islam

 isisi world cap-2019 main bhartiya cricket team kaa saamana mangalvaar ko edbeston cricket ground par bangladesh se hone ja rahaa he
 So far, the Indian team, who looked in good form, had to face England in their last match
 bangladesh ek aisi team he, jisase is world cap main achche pradarshan kii ummid to sabhi ne kii thi, lekin jis tarah kii cricket yah asian team khel rahi he, usne sabhi ko hairaan kar diya he
 The highlight of this team in this World Cup has been the consistency in its performance, the lack of which was found with the team before today
 donon ke bich vanade world cap main ab tak 3 mukaable hue hai, jinamein se bharat ne 2 match jite hai, jabaki bangladesh ko ek match main safalataa mili he
 Bangladesh had spoiled India in the 2007 World Cup, India will have to be cautious in the match to be held in Edgbaston
 vaise to bharat semifinal main jane se ek ank kii duuri par he, lekin agar bangladesh ke khilaaf use haar milti he to uskaa srilanka ke khilaaf match karo yaa maro jaisaa ho jayega
 Bangladesh can spoil the game of any team
 2007 world cap main isi team ne bharat ko maat dekar shuruaati daur se baahar kar diya tha
 In such a situation, India has to be cautious in looking at the current form of Bangladesh
 dhawan-shankar toornament se baahar hambharat ke khilaaf vaise bhi bangladesh ne amuman acha kiya he, kai jeeten hasil kii hai
 This time this team is in rhythm and full of confidence
 is match se pehle bharat ko ek or jhatka bhi laga he
 All-rounder Vijay Shankar has been ruled out of the World Cup due to a leg injury
 shankar bharat ke duusare aise khilaadi hai, jo world cap se baahar ho gaye hai
 Prior to that, Shikhar Dhawan also had to leave the tournament due to a thumb injury
 point tebleshakib ne balle-ball donon se kiya umdaa pradarshanbangladesh team ko yahaan tak pahunchane main uske sabase anbhavi khilaadi shaakib al hasan kaa ahm yogadan rahaa he, jinhone balle or gend se behtareen pradarshan kiya he
 At the same time, Tamim Iqbal has done well with the bat in big matches against teams like South Africa, England, New Zealand
 bangladesh sirf shaakib ke dam par hi nahin he
 Tamim Iqbal, Mahmudullah, Mushfiqur Rahim, Litton Das have also run the scoreboard with Shakib
 gendbaaji main captain mashrafe murtaja, mustafijur rahamaan team ke liye bada role nibhaate aae hai
 Bangladesh's hopes for the semi-finals: Jindalambe, who is on the field after the interval break, will once again depend heavily on Shakib against India and will hope that his and Rahim's pair will show up again in the big match
 is match main jeet bangladesh ke liye semifinal kii ummiido ko jinda rakhane ke liye bhi jaruri he
 India's performance against England was poor in the past year, Bangladesh is recognizing that when it comes to do or die situation, it takes a dangerous form
 bharat ko is baat se waakif rahanaa hoga
 If we talk about the Indian team, then she played against England a day ago i
e
 on Sunday and she has to play this match after a day's rest
 england ke khilaaf bhartiya team kaa vijay kram ruk gaya
 The Indian team also scored runs against the hosts and its batsmen could not score runs
 byaap plan ke saath team india ko chalanaa hogabhartiya gendbaajon ko is match main behatar ranneeti or byaap plan ke saath utarana hoga kyonki jis tarah kii ballebaaji jesan roy, johny beresto ne kii thi us tarah kii ballebaaji tameem, shaakib or rahim karne main sakasham hai
 When it comes to Indian batting, India has to consider once again that the absence of the top-order batsman till the end increases the chances of defeat for the team
 rohit or kohli ne england ke khilaaf behtareen paariyaan khelin, lekin jaise hi yah donon out hue, bhaar aayaa madhya kram par jahaan chotil shankar kii jagah number-4 par yuva rishabh pant ko mauka mila tha

 yah is tiger kaa khauf hi he ki hamirpur jile ke kunehata or mahoba jile ke gudi gaanv ke sabhi gramin 4 dinon se khule main shouch ko nahin ja rahe hai
 Perhaps this is why people are enjoying describing this tiger as the brand ambassador of ODF

 unhone mufti se poocha ki aakhir ye kaise sambhav hoga ki wo donon ko ek saath samarthan den?@mehboobamuftihas told the Congress she will support the UPA candidate for # rajyasabhavice Chairman
 She's also told the BJP she will support the NDA candidate

 Used the exact emoji
 unhone bhi jawaab main ek imoji kaa istemaal kiya
 😆 hats off to who ever operates your account for you
 They actually have a sense of humour 
 Nice emoji use 👍🏼— Omar Abdullah (@omarabdullah) August 7, 2018 The Mufti called the statement supporting the candidates of both the ruling party and the opposition as fake news and speculation
 unhone abdulla ko jawaab dete hue twit kiya, 'aamtaur par sandigdh news channelon dwaara phek news or juthi khabar chalaai jaati he
 But when a politician like Omar Abdullah concocts stories entirely based on imagination, such an attempt to confuse fails

 It is known that recently the alliance of PDP and BJP in Jammu and Kashmir has been broken, after which the coalition government in the state fell

 Both the ruling party and the opposition are trying hard to win their respective candidates in the Deputy Speaker elections to be held on August 9
 iske liye todphod kii raajnneeti bhi jari he
 Simultaneously, efforts are being made to get angry allies, because the displeasure of allies can prove dangerous in this election

 In fact, the Akali Dal hoped that the nda's deputy chairperson in the Rajya Sabha would be his candidate
 bataa den ki akali dal se naresh gujral kaa naam charchaa main tha, lekin antim samay par bijepi ne jediu ke saansad harivansh ko ummidavaar bana diya, jisase akali dal main naaraazgi hai
 For this, the Akali Dal Parliamentary Party headed by former Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal met at the house of Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal
 upasabhapati ke liye kya he rajyasabha kaa ganit?sankhyabal ke hisaab se dekha jaae, to rajyasabha main kul sadasyon kii sankhya 244 he
 Meaning the NDA needs the support of 123 members for a majority
 bijepi ke 73, jediu ke chah, akali dal ke teen, shivasena ke teen, bodo pipul frant ke ek, naga pipul frant ke ek, sikkim demkratic frant ke ek, arpiai ke ek, teen nirdaleey or teen manonith sadasyon ko milakar kar NDA ke paas 95 saansad hai
 In such a situation, the NDA needs another 28 mps to win the election
 sutron ke mutabik ediemke ke 13, tiares ke chah or wiesar congress ke do sadsy endie ke ummidavaar harivansh ko apana samarthan dene ke liye sahmati de chuke hai
 As of now, NDA candidate Harivansh has the support of 116 mps according to the latest numbers

 After winning the victory, he told reporters that Jinnah's picture in Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) shows a kind of mentality
 unhone kaha, 'ab is desh main jinna dhunde bhi nahin milegaa, sidhaa pakistan jayega
 'he said,' forget the previous things

 ''ab dekhtaa hum AMU kulapati kaise jawaab nahin dete'satish gautam yaheen nahin ruke, unhone aage kaha ki eemyu kulapati ne mere kai patron kaa jawaab nahin diya he, jo asanvaidhanik he
 Now let me see how they do not respond? Let me tell you that in May 2018, Aligarh MP Satish Gautam had given rise to the Jinnah controversy by saying that 'jinnah mentality' would have to be removed from AMU
 iske baad yah vivaad centre sarkaar tak pahunchaa tha
 Meanwhile, Satish Gautam had written a letter to AMU University VC Tariq Mansoor asking why Jinnah's picture has been installed in the university
 After this incident, Satish Gautam took Jinnah's name even after one year of voting
 satish gautam ne kaha tha ki unka pehla mudda ye he ki aligarh muslim uniwarsity main anusuchit jati / janajati va anya pichhadaa varg ke hindu samaaj ke chaatro ko bhi aarakshan mili
 Now after winning the victory again, once again Satish Gautam has asked to remove Jinnah's picture from AMU
 saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki eemyu main essi-asti or obisi varg ke chaatro ko daakhila or aarakshan milegaa

 Responding to Rahul Gandhi, RK Singh said that it is a wrong thing to question the martyrdom of the martyrs family and the valor of our army
 aisa pehle kabhi nahin hua he
 Union Minister Singh said that there were many attacks in India earlier, but the Congress Party government did not take any revenge
 yah narendra modi kii sarkaar he, jisane shahadat kaa badla liya he
 If Pulwama attack happened, then Prime Minister Narendra Modi took revenge
 bhartiya vayusena ne pakistan main ghuskar aatankiyon ke thikaanon ko tabah kiya
 If anyone with an understanding of international strategy will be discussed in this matter, then he will tell what the Modi government has done
 pulavama aatanki hamale ke baad modi sarkaar ne jo kiya, wo aatankiyon ko kadaa sandesh detaa he ki agar aap hamako maarenge, to ham aapako maarenge
 If you kill one, we kill two
 aarake singh ne kaha ki air strike ke jariye modi sarkaar ne yah bhi sandesh diya ki agar hindustan par aankh uthaai, to ham andar ghuskar maarenge
 Earlier, the government did not take revenge for any terrorist attack
 congress adhyaksh par prahaar karte hue aarake singh ne kaha ki jin bahadur payalton ne pakistan ke bheetar ghuskar aatankiyon par hamalaa kiya, un par sawalia nishaanaa lagane par rahul gandhi ko shame aani chahie
 On the allegations against Rahul Gandhi of becoming a poster boy in Pakistan and the Congress president's retaliation against Narendra Modi, RK Singh said that these people are well aware of who is the poster boy in Pakistan
 pakistan ke tivi channelon main poster bvoy dikhte hai
 During this, RK Singh said that the President of the Congress Party is speaking the language of Pakistan, which is a very shameful thing
 darasal, guuruuvaar ko rahul gandhi ne press conference main kaha ki pulavama hamale main shahid hue javaanon ke parijan ne bhi poocha he ki pakistan or uske aatankiyon ke khilaaf kya karrwai hui?is dauraan pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki wo navaj sharif se milane pakistan gaye the or pathankot main hamale ke baad iesai ko bulaayaa tha
 Let me tell you that after the Pulwama terror attack, the Indian Air Force entered into Balakot in Pakistan and carried out an air strike on the bases of the terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammad, in which a lot of terrorists are being killed
 haalanki bharat main kuch netaa bhartiya vayusena dwaara kii gai air strike ke saboot maang rahe hai
 At the same time, surveillance by the National Technical Research Organization (NTRO) revealed that when the Indian Air Force carried out an air strike, more than 280 mobile phones were active in the jaish-e-mohammed terrorist camps in Balakot
 iske aadhaar par yah daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki bhartiya vayusena kii karrwai main 280 se zyada aatanki maare gaye the
 We all know that urea is not good for farming and farming
 iskaa asar ham sabake swasthya par bhi pad rahaa he
 But what is going on in the world of urea, we do not know
 indian express main kheti ke panne par ji ravi prasad kaa ek lekh dekha
 In the introduction to G
 Ravi Prasad it is written that he is an expert in agrochemicals and manure management
 inkaa sawaal he ki bharat ko aakhir kitna uria chahie
 As much as urea is sufficient
 use sasti daron par kisaanon ke haath main dena na kheti ke liye thik he or na hi sabsidi ke lihaaz se desh kii arthvyavastha ke liye
 The farmer gets urea at a rate of less than five and a half rupees per kg, so does not hesitate to use it
 kisaanon ko uria kaa nuksaan acchhee tarah se pataa he magar ve kai kaarnon se iske chakra se nahin nikal pate hai
 When urea enters the fields, after coming in contact with soil moisture, ammonia forms gas and delivers it to the air
 isse nikalne vaala nitrogen bhu-jal ko prabhavit karata he
 If you use urea more then the poison of nitrate increases in air and water
 pradooshit hota he
 India made neem coated urea production mandatory in 2015-16
 neem kaa tel ammonia or nitrogen banane kii prakriya ko dhimaa kar detaa he
 The bag of urea was also reduced from 50 kg to 45 kg
 europea sangh ne tay kiya he ki 2020 se urio main uries or nitriphication inhibitor kaa istamaal hoga
 Apart from the neem layer
 kya vaaki sara uria neem coted hota he? yah sawaal man main uthta he
 We do not know how many factories made necessary technical changes to coat neem, how much investment was made on them? How does the common farmer investigate whether urea is neem coated? Only farmers who use urea should answer this
 2015-16 main uria kaa utpaadan 24
 48 million tons
 bikri hui 31
 97 million tons
 yah sabase adhik tha
 Sales were high because we also import urea
 2016-17, 2017-18 main uria ke utpaadan main aanshik giravat aati he
 24
 20 million or 24
 02 millitons ton
 bikri main bhi thodi kami aati he
 Imported urea also decreases
 ji ravi prasad kehete hai ki sarkaar ko uria ke upbhog main kami laane kaa prayaas tej karnaa chahie magar uskaa dhyaan uria kaa utpaadan badhaane par he
 The government is going to start a closed five urea factory
 chambal fertiliser bhi plant laga rahaa he
 If urea was produced according to the capacity in these plants, the production of urea in India would be 32 million tonnes per annum, a peak of 24 in 2015-16
 48 million ton se bhi zyaada hoga
 G
 Ravi Prasad says that its burden will fall on the treasure of India
 iske liye unhone uria ke utpaadan main istamaal hone vaale prakritik gas kii maatra or laagat kaa hisaab nikaala he
 On this basis, it is said that half of the requirement is to import natural gas
 prakritik gas simit maatra main he
 Why should they be used in urea production? agar bharat uria kii khapat main sirf 10 pratishat kii kami le aae, jo ki mumkin he, to paanch saal ke ausat ke hisaab se uria ke aayaat par hi 5,680 karod kii bachat ho jaaegi
 The cost of making urea under the new standard would be 6,400 crore
not only will the money be saved khapat main kami hone se paisa hi nahin bachegaa balki kheti or kheton kii sehat ko bhi laabh hoga

 Ravi Prasad says that if urea can be imported at $ 250 per ton, then what is the point of spending $ 420 per ton on production
 vaise bhi sarkaar ko uria par kaaphi sabsidi deni hoti he
 Urea production in the new plant will increase but its export will be difficult
 kyonki utpaadan ke liye kaaphi mahangi daron par prakritik gas kaa aayaat karnaa padegaa jisase laagat bad jaaegi
 Obviously, efforts will be made to increase its consumption in the Indian market in some way
 hindi ke akhabaaron main is tarah kii baaten kahaan hoti hai
 We do not know what is the other side of Ravi Prasad's talk, yet you read it
 kam se kam isi bahaane uria ke sawaal par sochna to shuru karenge
 a new thing will be debated

 The crooks reached the bank at midnight with the intention of robbing them
 lekin consteble ne unpar fire kar diya
 Due to this, he ran away fearfully
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki bank main 925 karod rupee the
 If the crooks had managed to loot it, it would have been the biggest robbery of the country
 mili jaankaree ke anusaar, jaipur ke ji-skim aria main sthit bank main der ratahathiyaaron se lasabdmaashon ne dhaava bolaa
 All the robbers had covered their mouths

 While the miscreants were trying to open the shutter, Constable Sitaram (27), who was inside, opened fire, after which all the miscreants ran away
 yah puri ghatana sisitivi main kaid ho gai
 On this, ACP (crime) Prafulla Kumar told that when the crooks were trying to break the shutter of the bank, Sitaram saw them from inside
 usne badmaashon par firing shuru kar di or mauka pate hi alarm baja diya
 Within minutes, a large number of policemen arrived at the bank
 police control room ko bhi soochna de di gai
 Which led to the blockade in the city

 Therefore, the possibility of torrential rain has deepened in Odisha and West Bengal for the next 24 hours
 uske baad bhi tamaam ilaakon main rah-rahakarbarish kaa silsilaajari rahegaa
 The Meteorological Department has issued warnings of rains for the next two-three days at many places in Odisha as well as in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and East Madhya Pradesh

 mausam vibhaag kaa kahana he ki odisha, purvi madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or jharkhand main agle 48 ghante tak baari barish kii khaasi sambhaavna he
 According to the Meteorological Department, the depression in the Bay of north-west Bengal has now turned into a deep depression
 deep depressant banane ke baad ye wedar system ab pashchim bengal kii taraf chal diya he or is baat kii khaasi sambhaavna he ki deep depressant digha tat par 17 taarikh kii raat ko pahunch jaae
 Along with this, the Meteorological Department has advised fishermen in the coastal areas of West Bengal not to venture into the sea

 When the deep depression hits the coast, it will turn into a low pressure area
 iske baad odisha, jharkhand or chhattisgarh hota hua ye wedar system madhya pradesh main joardaar barish degaa
 Due to this weather system, a series of rains will be seen for the next three days
 mausam ke jaankaron kaa kahana he ki 20 taarikh ko bengal kii khadi main ek doosraa kam dabaav kaa kshetra ban rahaa he
 This low pressure area will also strengthen and come towards Odisha
 is wedar system ke banane par mausam vibhaag puri tarah se najar rakhe hue he
 Awam is a group formed last year by activists who turned away from the Aam Aadmi Party
 chunaav se thik chaar din pehle avam ne aam aadmi party ke khilaaf khulaase jaisaa kuch kar ke sansani failaane kii koshish kii he
 Awam alleges that in the month of April last year, four checks worth Rs 50 lakh were deposited in the account of Aam Aadmi Party
 jin chaar companiyon ne ye check chande ke rup main die, darasal ve companiyaan bogus hai
 These companies are working to make 'black Money' into 'white Money'
 avam ne khud bhi press conference main in companiyon ke do check dikhaae, jin par koi taarikh nahin thi
 What does this prove against the Aam Aadmi Party? Awam wants to prove that the Aam Aadmi Party wants to make his black money appear white by turning it into a check, but Awam himself seems to be stuck in his questions
 press conference main jab unase poocha gaya ki in companiyon ke diarector koun log hai to is sawaal ko ye kahkar taal diya ki ham suraksha kaarnon kii vajah se naam nahin bataa sakate
 When asked how these companies gave you the check without putting a date, then they did not even reply to it
 avam kii manshaa yaheen se sandigdh ho jaati he
 It is true that the addresses of these companies are fake, but these companies are registered, have bank account and PAN number
 inke bijnes or ghate-munaafe ke bare main koi jaankaree uplabdh nahin he
 The Aam Aadmi Party did not take precaution, but the question is to what extent the precaution should be taken
 agar party ke paas chanda aata he to zyaada se zyaada uski bank sambandhit jaankariyaan hi dekhi ja sakati hai or jise aam aadmi party ne dekha bhi
 However, after seeing such a huge amount of money for once, curiosity must have arisen in the mind of the Aam Aadmi Party as to who is so kind to them
 aam aadmi party ne ab tak takreeban 20 karod rupee hi ikatthe kiye hai or zaahir he in 2 karod rupayon kaa bhi isamen bada yogadan he, lekin kanoonee rup se is maamle par aam aadmi party ke khilaaf koi cese nahin banataa he
 If questions are being raised on the intention, then the answer of the Aam Aadmi Party in its argument is that if it was only black money, why would it be converted into a check and put its information on the website
 aakhir isaki jaankaree virodhiyon ko aam aadmi party kii website se hi mili he
 BJP also tried to capitalize on these allegations in its favor
 lekin bijepi ne bhi pakki taiyaari nahin kii thi
 In his press conference held on Monday, he was seen raising many absurd questions
 masalan, kaise 4 check raat ke 12 baje ek saath jamaa hue? yogendra yadav ne apane jawaab main kaha ki bijepi ise bada khufia rang de rahi he, lekin website par jaankaree bank nahin, party aplod karti he
 There is also truth in this matter, because banks are not open at 12 o'clock at night
 soshal media par ek sting bhi gum rahaa he, jahaan avam ke sadsy kisi kii hawa utaarne kii saazish rachate nazar aa rahe hai haalanki sting kitna sahi he isaki pushti patrkaar nahin kar sakate
 It is also reported that the members of the Awam are related to the BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party as well as the Congress believe that this is a 'dirty trick' of the BJP
 aam aadmi party ne jab kaha ki vah sabhi partiyon ke fund kii jaanch ke liye court main apil karenge tab bhaajapa ke vitt mantri arun jetali ne haasyaaspad bayaan diya ki is gandi raajnneeti main mananeey court ko na ghasita jaae
 The question is: whose dirty politics was Arun Jaitley pointing to? in aaropon kaa nuksaan aam aadmi party ko ho saktaa tha agar baaki rajnatik partiyon ne apane chandon kaa hisaab saarvajanik kiya hua hota, lekin is vaqt bhaajapa or neshnal conference ke umr abdullah bhi ye baat sabit karne par amada hai ki aam aadmi party alag nahin, balki unke jaisi hi ek party he
 After all, why not investigate how these companies got registered at fake addresses? Why should not the names of their owners be public, after all, according to the allegations, these companies turn black money white
 bhaajapa ne centre main apni sarkaar hote hue bhi jaanch ke aadesh kyon nahin die? kul milakar bhaajapa or avam kii ye chaal bhi flop sabit hoti dikh rahi he

 Ashwani Lohani, chairman of Air India, may meet Rajnish Kumar, chairman of the State Bank of India, to buy large jets of Jet Airways
 donon ke bich yah mulaakaat dilli main ho sakati he
 Darsial, a group of banks led by SBI has control of Jet Airways
 aise main jet airways se jude maamalon par faisla lene kaa adhikaar esbiai ke paas he
 According to the information, Air India has shown interest in leasing out the five big jets of Jet Airways
 iske liye air india ke chairman aswani lohani ne state bank pramukh ko patr bhi likhaa tha
 Jet Airways currently has 16 major aircraft
 inamen 10 bi 777- 300iaar or chah airbas e330es vimaan hai
 What is the purpose of Air India? Air India wants to put these aircraft into service on its international routes
 darasal, air india naye antarrashtriya margon par udaan sevaayen shuru karnaa chahta he
 In addition, it also intends to increase the number of flights on existing international routes, but it does not have additional aircraft to do so
 paisanger ko bhi kar rahi madbais bich air india ne jet airways ke asthaayee rup se fanse antarrashtriya yatriyon kii mushkilen kam karne ke liye vishesh kiraye kii peshkash kii he
 Air India said in a statement that "special fares" have been offered to passengers stranded at foreign airports in Paris, London Heathrow, Singapore, Dubai, Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi, Jeddah and Muscat
 air india ne kaha ki jin yatriyon ke paas jet airways kii vaapasi kii conform tikat hogi, ve air india ke " fanse hue yatriyon ke liye vishesh kiraaya package " kaa laabh uthaa sakenge
 Why did this happen? Jet Airways, started by travel agent Naresh Goyal in the 80s, provided airlines to millions of passengers for two and a half decades, but the airline's debt crisis began to wane after the 2010 crisis
 is dauraan company ko lagaataar ghaataa uthaanaa padaa
 After this, Jet Airways started failing to pay the debt
 pichley saal disambar main 123 vimaanon ke saath parichaalan karne vaali company ne beete mangalvaar ko keval paanch vimaanon ke saath parichaalan kiya
 Currently, Jet Airways owes more than Rs 8,500 crore to banks
 agar aap koi aisa utpaada lenaa chaahate hai jisamen chhot mili to aapaki talash share bazaar main maujuud closed-and mutual fund se puri ho jaani chahie
 Many mutual funds are coming to the market with huge discounts i
e
 at a much lower price than the Net Asset Value (NAV)
 yahaan usase sambandhit kuch jaankariyaan di ja rahi hai ki yah kaise kaam karata he or kya aapako isamen paisa lagaana chahie
 Mutual fund funds are mainly of two types - open ended and closed ended
 open anded mutual pha fund ve hote hai jinhen kabhi bhi kharida or bechaa saktaa he yaa usase baahar niklaa ja saktaa he jabaki closed-anded fund keval launch ke samay hi fund house se kharide ja sakate hai
 Also, you can come out of it only after a certain period, that is, you can sell
 yah avadhi alag-alag ho sakati he
 To ensure liquidity, these schemes need to be listed on the stock market so that investors can buy and sell them in the secondary market
 lekin share bazaaron main is tarah ke fund kam maatra main uplabdh hote or isliye enevi ke mukaable chhot ke saath kam keemton par beche jate hai
 For example, the NAV of the Axis Equity Advantage Fund Series-1 Regular Plan (growth) on 11 October
 04 ru
 But at the end of that day its value was 9 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE)
 38 ru
 Was
 iskaa matlab he ki enevi ke mukaable yah 15 pratishat chhot ke saath bechaa gaya
 Similarly, many other closed-end mutual funds are also available with discounts
 phaayde kaa saudanivesh kaa buniyadi siddhant he kam keemat par khareednaa or oonchi keemat par bechnaa
 Says Jiju Vidyadharan, Senior Director, Crisil Research, "closed-ended funds are less traded on the stock exchanges, so they are available with huge discounts
 lekin inamen chhot or anya phaayde paripakvata kii avadhi or tex ke mutabik alag-alag hote hai
 Experts say that closed-ended funds offer good opportunities for better returns
 daalamia adwyjuri services ke diarector brijesh daalamia kehete hai, ''secondary bazaar se closed-anded fund khareednaa or atirikt phayda lene ke liye use paripakvata kii avadhi tak rakhe rahanaa kharaab idia nahin he
 "they say," but the discount being given to the investor and the remaining period of the scheme should be taken into consideration
 '' unki salaah he ki niveshak ko paripakvata or uski avadhi puri hone ke kareeb tak ise rakhana chahie
 Buyers who intend to sell it at intervals of a few days may have to sell it at a discount
 leader 7 financial adwyjaries ke sansthaapak suresh sadgopan kehete hai, ''niveshkon ko closed-anded fund lete samay isse jude jokhim ke str ko dhyaan main rakhana chahie or sochna chahie ki kya ve yah jokhim uthaane ke liye taiyaar hai
 
 
 If yes, then invest money in such schemes and stay connected with it till the maturity period so that there is more profit
 ''niveshak nimna baton ko bhi dhyaan main rakhenyojana kaa pichhlaa pradarshnah mutual fund kaa laabh alag-alag skiimon se sidhe judaa hota he
 Even if you buy mutual funds from the secondary market, the benefit on maturity is based on NAV
 udhaaharan ke liye, agar aap koi fund secondary bazaar se 12 ru
 NAV of Rs 11 at the time of maturity due to buy in and not perform well
 rahata he to uskaa laabh paripakvata ke saath enevi ke maujuuda mulya par aadhaarit hoga
 "what's important is how the fund's past performance has been," says Dalmia
 yah saath ke duusare fundon ke samaan hona chahie yaa phir usase behatar hona chahie
 "their advice is not to invest money in a fund that has not performed well, even if they are being given more leeway
" taraltah visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki niveshkon ko apana paisa bich main hi nahin nikaalnaa chahie
 Says Sadagopan, "to get good profit, the investor must stay till the maturity period
 ''bazaar main maang or aapurti kaa niyam hi keemat tay karata he
 If you need to withdraw your money, there is no other way to get out of it except through the stock market
 aisi sthiti main aapako jaldbaaji main bazaar main fund bechnaa pad saktaa he or tab jaahir he, aapako nuksaan uthaanaa hoga
 Tax: You have to pay a short-term tax at the rate of 15 percent on the capital gain you get for investing in a stock in less than one year and a long-term tax at the rate of 10 percent on the capital gain for an investment of more than one year
 tex main bachat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue behatar laabh paane ke liye aapako aise saajha kosh main paisa lagaana chahie jisaki paripakvata avadhi ek saal se zyada ho
 In the case of debt funds, the investor needs to be more careful as the short-term tax is levied on the gains from investments of less than three years which are subject to personal tax
 udhaaharan ke liye agar aap teen saal se pehle date fund main nivesh par 10,000 ru
 If you get capital gains of Rs, then this profit will be added to your total income and then you will have to pay tax according to your slab
 lekin agar aap use teen saal se adhik samay tak apane paas rakhte hai to aapako zyada phayda hoga, khaskar tex ke oonche slab main kyonki date fund main dderghaavadhi puunjigat laabh tex 20 pratishat hota he
 Conclusion Of course, buying closed-ended funds with a discount may be a good investment option but finding such an opportunity is not an easy task
 share bazaar main bahut si closed-anded yojanaayen soochibaddh hai jo alag-alag tarah kii hai jaise ki mid cap, small cap or thematic
 Says Vidyadharan, "it does not seem easy to identify such funds with the right discounts
" nivesh ke baad aapako paripakvata tak fund main bane rahanaa chahie
 To exit early, you may have to sell it at a discount to the market
 '' ve kehete hai ki khudara niveshkon ko lambii avadhi ke hisaab se open-anded yaa closed-anded mutual pha fund main nivesh karnaa chahie, tabhi unhen acha phayda mil saktaa he, na ki fori phaayde ko dhyaan main rakhkar
 Keep in mind before investing
 Be aware that you are willing to take the risk in the scheme you are investing in
 Performance is dependent on the performance of the fund, so put money in a better fund
 Liquidity is a disadvantage when selling funds quickly before maturity
 isliye macurity tak fund main bane rahanaa sunishchit karentaxzyada kar dene se aapkaa phayda ghat jaataa he lihaaja ek saal baad maior hone vaale fund main nivesh karenritail niveshkon ko adarsh paristhitiyon main open anded yaa close and fund main baraabar bantwaaraa karke lambii avadhi kaa lakshya tay karke paise lagane chahie
 Only then will the profits be realized

 unhone koi naam nahin liya tha lekin shabd kaa istemaal is tarah kiya ki kai logon ne ise aise samajha ki ye sonia gandhi ko lekar kaha gaya
 On December 4, at a Chunavi rally in Jaipur, PM Modi had lashed out at the Congress over various allegations of corruption
 isi dauraan wo vidhwaa pension skim kaa hawala de rahe the
 Modi said, 'during the Congress rule, the names of thousands of' widows' were listed in the government lists but in reality they did not exist and the money went to these widow accounts
 ’pradhanmantri kaa bhaashan unke aadhikarik utyub channel par bhi aplod he
 At the 42nd minute in the original speech, Modi begins talking about the alleged widow pension scheme
 bhaashan ke is hisse main unhone jo kaha, wo jas kaa tas is prakaar he- “hamaare desh main, congress ne aisi sarkaar chalaai ki jo beti paidaa nahin hui, jis beti kaa janm nahin hua, wo congress sarkaron ke kagaz pe wo beti vidhwaa bhi ho gai
 
 
 And the daughter's widow pension also started getting
 
 
 ye rupye koun koun vidhwaa thi jo leti thi? ye congress kii koun si vidhwaa thi, jiske khate main rupaya jaataa tha
 During his election campaign, Modi hit out at the nehru-gandhi family
 jis bhaashan kaa sandarbh diya ja rahaa he wo bhi isse alag nahin tha
 Although Modi did not openly name Sonia Gandhi while making a 'widow' remark, users on social media got a chance to interpret their own meaning of what the Prime Minister actually wanted to say

 filmmekar shaan sahib ne lead role play kiya he
 On making a remake of the film, Shaan said that it was very important to collaborate with the Indian crew
 puja bhatta ne 3 saal kii umr main kamaaye the 1200 rupee, ghar chalaane main mili thi madadshaan kaa kahana he ki ham pakistani, bharat ke saath usee tarah kaam kar sakate hai jo china, america ke liye karata he
 Speaking further, Shaan said that the cost of making films in India at this time is very high and i think in the coming 5 years the situation will be that the makers will not be able to afford the cost of making a grade films
 tab wo aisi jabah dhughange jahaan jaakar wo film bana saken
 Talking about the film, Shaan said that i could name the remake film anything but nothing could connect more people than its original title
 mujhe aisa lagata he ki ye ek brij he jise ham insaaniyat ke liye bana sakate hai bina kisi raajnneeti ko shaamil kiye
 Mahesh Bhatt Threat Case- The accused made threatening calls to 8 more celebrities, on the other hand Mahesh Bhatt has congratulated Shaan for the film
 apni film kii rimek banane par utsahit mahesh kaa kahana tha ki shaan sahib ne us film kaa rimek banaaya he jisase meraa kariyar shuru hua tha
 Now it remains to be seen how the film is made because every filmmaker has his own style
 a stunning looking film shot with passion

 Taking advantage of Pakistan's intelligence agency isi's revelations by the wikileaks about relations with the Taliban and al-qaeda, the US may pressurize Islamabad to take strong action against militant groups operating in its territory

 ’obama prashasan ke kai adhikariyon ke nijee vichaar akhbaar main uddhrut kiye gaye hai

 ek bade buki ne naam na chhapane kii shart par kaha ki dilli main bijepi ko 5-6 siten milengi or aam aadmi party ko 1-2 siten mil sakati hai

 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ke liye bhavishyavaanee karte hue buki ne bataaya ki use 231 se 233 tak siten aa sakati hai
 Regarding the Congress, it says that the party can get 71-73 seats
 aam aadmi party ko desh bhar main 5-6 siten mil sakati hai
 Buchi said that this means that if someone puts a bet of Rs 1,000 on the BJP that the party will not get 231 seats and if the party actually wins 230 or less seats then it will get Rs 1,000
 isi tarah agar koi yah satta lagaataa he ki bijepi 233 siten yaa zyada jeetegi to us vyakti ko 1,000 rupee milenge
 But if it does not happen, then its money will be confiscated
 piem ummidavaar ke liye buki kaa kahana tha ki buudhvaar yaa guuruuvaar kii subah tak agar modi par koi ek lakh rupee lagayegaa or agar vah jeet gaye to satta lagane vaale ko 40,000 rupee milenge

 isi tarah karnataka main 28 main se 18 siten or kerala main 20 main se 4 siten milane kaa anumaan he

 The first sight of this split is seen in UP where the SP-BSP alliance has broken up immediately
 mangalvaar ko bispi adhyaksh mayawati ne ghoshnaa kar di ki uttar pradesh main aane vaale up chunaavon main wo akhilesh yadav kii samaajawaadee party or areldi ke saath bane gathbandhan kaa hissaa nahin rahengi or unki party akele hi ye chunaav ladegi
 Mayawati alleged that Akhilesh Yadav could not get his caste votes to the BSP candidates, i
e
 Akhilesh failed to get the votes transferred
 india today exis maay india ke post pole survey ke aankadon ko jaanch kar india today data intelligence unit ne paaya ki ye aarope galat hai
 In this alliance formed before the Lok Sabha elections, the advantage actually came to Mayawati and not to the Samajwadi Party, because the Yadavs unitedly voted for the BSP but the Dalits did not show such solidarity for the Samajwadi Party
 yadav-ekajute vot bainkyadav, dalit or musalmaan milakar uttar pradesh kaa 49 pratishat hissaa banaate hai
 The India Today Axis My India Post poll survey showed that in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Yadavs and Muslims showed more commitment to the alliance than Dalits
 uttar pradesh main dalit vot do shreniyon main bante hue hai jatav or gaiyr jatav
 While Jatav Dalits have been supporting the BSP, non-jatav Dalits had distanced themselves from the party in the 2014 elections
 yadav-dalit-musalmaan samudaayon main se 10 pratishat to gaiyr jatav hi hai, ab sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke paas 39 pratishat vot bank batch paata he
 The survey also made it clear that while 72 percent of the Yadavs voted for the alliance, 74 percent of the Jatav Dalits chose the alliance
 vahiin, bijepi ko vot dene ke sawaal par dalit samudaay ke log kuch aage najar aate hai
 20 percent Yadav, 21 percent Jatav Dalits chose BJP
 gaiyr jatvon main se 60 pratishat ne bhaajapa ko vot diya or 30 pratishat ne gathbandhan ko
 The Axis My India survey also shows that the welfare schemes of the BJP were a major contributor to bring non-jatav Dalits to their side
 garib mahilaon ke liye muft gas conection, shauchalayon kaa nirmaan or awaas jaisi skiimon ne gaiyr jatav vot bank ko apni ore khinchaa
 Even in the seats, BSP did not put anything in the hands of Mayawati in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 5 saal pehle basapa ek bhi seat nahin jeet pai thi
 At the same time, Samajwadi Party had won 5 seats by fighting alone
 gathbandhan kaa hi nateeja he ki 2019 main basapa 10 siten jeetne main kaamyaab hui, jabaki samaajawaadee party 5 siton par jyon kii tyon bani rahi
 Of those 5 seats, 2 belonged to Mulayam Singh Yadav and his son Akhilesh Yadav
 mayawati ne jis bhi vajah se gathbandhan tod diya ho, lekin aankade duusari hi kahani kah rahe hai or akhilesh ke saath gathjod kaa sabase zyada phayda unhen hi mila he

 lekin ye yphone yugers ke liye mushkil he
 Because apps that lock apps on ios's App Store are negligible
 kuch asp hai bhi, lekin inke liye paise dene hote hai
 This is probably the reason why the whatsapp lock feature will first come to ios

 In the election season, the politics of allegations and counter-allegations are on the rise
 reliyon se road-sho tak
 From street street to flashlight padyatra
 sabhi netaa bas isi jugat main lage hai ki kisi tarah bas unke khate main janata ke adhik se adhik vot aa jaae
 In this election season, the leaders are keeping an eye on every issue, from tightening each other to their speech
 is baar kaa chunaav, logo ke bich seat or vot ke charchaa kaa vishay hone ke saath-saath raajnneeti ke liye ek style trend bhi set kar rahaa he
 There are some leaders in India who are famous among the people for their style and dressing sense besides their politics
 to aaie jaanate he, koun hai bhartiya raajnneeti ke stylish netaa
 1
 narendra modithgar pahanaave ke aadhaar par bhartiya raajnneeti ke stylish netaa kii ho rahi ho to usame sabase pehla naam bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa hoga
 Modi's dressing sense is worth praising
 jo unpar kaaphi fabtaa bhi he
 Khadi's half-sleeved kurtas with linen churidars are part of his identity
 uske alaava khaadi ke kurte par vibhinn rango ke jackets unke is poshaak kii shaan ko or badha dete hai
 From Kurtos of different colors to jackets and suits, Narendra Modi looks amazing in every dress
 unhonen baraak obama ke bharat daure ke dauraan ek aisa suut pahana tha jisame unka naam likhaa tha jo bhartiya media ke liye charchaa kaa vishay ban gaya tha
 Like his suit, Modi has also become a subject of much discussion regarding his dressing and style sense

 2
 shashi tharurkshashi tharur india ke fashneble netaaon main se ek hai
 a mix of style and politics is seen in Shashi Tharoor
 apni bayaanbaji kii tarah wo logo ke bich apane fishan style ke liye bhi jane jate hai
 Tharoor is not left behind to leave an impression of his dressing on the people and is known for his attire which sets him apart from the leaders
 tharur zyaadaatar chatkh rang ke kurte or pajamen yaa trouger main dekhe jate hai
 But Tharoor also has a variety of stylish suits and traditional mundu and kurtas that Tharoor wears on special occasions

 (deeksha Priyadarshi is an ITMI student and a trainee at India Today) *** agar lalu prasad yadav mugalate ke shikaar hue hai to bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) deevaaron par likhi ibaarat ko samaj nahin pai
 The BJP, which wrote the biggest success story in Bihar election 2010, got a wish without any mercy
 usne jitne kii ummid nahin kii thi usase kahin zyada siten milin
 Earlier, its leaders were saying, "we will win some seats, some will lose
" '' sabko lag rahaa tha ki bhaajapa ek baar phir badi party jad(you) ke saaye main rahane ke liye majaboor rahegi
 But the party surprised everyone by winning 91 of its 102 candidates
 use 2005 kii 55 siton ke mukaable is baar 36 adhik siten milin
 The truth is that even the leaders of the party are surprised by such a massive victory
 bhaajapa ko iskaa andaja nahin tha
 So it took time for her to react officially to the result
 aashcharya nahin ki usne patna ke apane karyaalay main sabase aakhir main samvaadadaata sammelan bulaayaa
 At that time Lalu and ljp's Ram Vilas Paswan were answering the last question of the media
 is deree kaa kaaran shaayad susheel kumaar modi or si
 P
 thakur ko saath laane main hui ho sakati he
 By the way, the two leaders smiled and took photographs together
 bhaajapa ne yah kamaal kaise kar dikhaaya? haalanki modi ne ise ''sakaaratmak vot'' qaraar diya lekin bhagava party kii kamyaabi ke peeche kai vajahen lagati hai-noummid vipaksh or rajg ke voton kaa safal mishran se lekar jamini str par badhiya prabandhan
 In addition, delimitation of constituencies also played its part
 isaki vajah se pichley vidhansabha chunaav main jahaan 52 nirvachan kshetron main agadi jatiyon kii paryaapt sankhya thi, vahiin is baar aise kshetron kii sankhya 72 ho gai
 The Forward refused to go with the Congress and continued to support the BJP
 iske alaava, behatar parinaam kaa ek kaaran yah bhi ki bhaajapa ke ummidavaar hi uplabdh vikalpon main behatar maane ja rahe the
 Importantly, even though both the BJP and the JD (U) are telling the NDA victory and thanks to each other, they held separate press conferences to describe their success story
 isse kai logon ko laga ki yah gathnabandhan ke saajheedaaron ke bich apni badhat sabit karne kii shuruyaat thi
 In fact, the JD (U) 81, which secured 115 seats in 141, achieved nearly 90 percent success by the saffron party
 56 fisadi safalataa ke mukaable behatar pradarshan kiya
 Now the points of reference have changed
 bhaajapa kii kamyaabi se sabit hota he ki donon saajheedaaron ne ek-duusare ko bakhubi vot hastantarit kiya
 Lalu and Paswan clearly failed to make such cooperation
 nitish kumaar ne mukhyamantri banane ke baad se ati pichhadi jatiyon (ibisi), muslim or mahadalit kaa anokhaa jod taiyaar karke majboot saamaajik aadhaar taiyaar kiya he
 The BJP, on the other hand, has retained its traditional vote bank of businessmen and upper castes, while the opposition — with the Congress and RJD-LJP fighting separately — represented people from different social groups
 donon partiyon kii shandaar jeet ko alag karke nahin dekha ja saktaa
 This proves that the NDA has considerable acceptance among the voters
 haalanki nitish kumaar ne laalkrishna adwani samet bhaajapa ke kai pramukh netaaon ke saath koi saajha chunaav prachaar nahin kiya
 Perhaps Arun Jaitley was the only major national leader of the BJP with whom Nitish went out to campaign
 haalanki agadon kaa bada varg nitish kumaar se khush nahin tha phir bhi unhone bhaajapa or uske saajheedaar ko vot diya
 BJP liked him better than Congress
 shuru main congress se ummid thi lekin vah dhire-dhire khatm ho gai
 Similarly, Lalu failed to gain confidence despite promising 10 per cent reservation for the forward castes
 ye parinaam jad (you) ke liye vishesh rup se mahatvapurn hai kyonki ateet main nitish kumaar bhaajapa se zyada chunavi laabh uthaate the
 This time the situation was reversed
 yah record se jaahir ho jaataa haih rajya main jad (you) kaa vot pratishat 2000 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad 2009 ke aam chunaav main kareeb chaar guna bad gaya jabaki bhaajapa kaa gir gaya
 BJP only 13 in 2009 general election
 93 fisadi vot hi bator pai, jo uske rashtriya ausat 18
 Was less than 8
 lekin 2010 main party phir apana aadhaar badhaakar saamne ai
 Before the assembly elections, the BJP was seen as a party that is ready to play the supporting role of Nitish Kumar for political gains
 kai logon kaa maananaa tha ki 2004 or 2009 ke aam chunaav main haar ke baad bhaajapa kaa kendriya netritv bhavishya main centre tak pahunchane ke liye nitish ko seedhi samajhane laga tha
 In the past, the BJP has allowed everything from keeping Narendra Modi away from campaigning for the sake of maintaining an alliance, to the Nitish government implementing pro-minority measures
 in chunaav nateezon se bhaajapa main ek doosraa modi ubhar aayaa he-bihar ke upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi, jo rajya main party kaa cheharaa hai
 His stature now seems to have risen considerably
 sanyogvash, modi ko party ke bheetar or baahar saarvajanik rup se nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa tha
 He was being projected as someone who often bowed down to Nitish
 lekin ve badi hoshiyaari ke saath samaveshi agenda par kaam kar rahe the, yah kaam bhaajapa ke pehle ke netaa nahin kar paae the
 Now his party has an example, which proves how moderate electoral politics have more electoral benefits than soft Hindutva
 party ko is apratyaashit safalataa se rashtriya raajnneeti main bhi badhat mil sakati he
 Modi says, "it's a win for progress and development
" in parinaamon se yah dharna khatm ho gai he ki kuch varg hamen vot nahin dete
 Even minorities supported the BJP
 ''abhi tak bihar main rajg kii is safalataa kii visheshta yah rahi he ki bhaajapa ne nitish ke alpsankhyak samarthak agenda ko shaamil karne main kaaphi dariyaadilii dikhaai he
 Perhaps the party felt that Nitish may not need BJP, he needs him more
 iske peeche mukhyatah yah dharna thi ki nitish apane boote saamaanya bahumat hasil kar sakate hai
 He did so by winning 115 seats alone - just seven short of the majority in the Assembly
 lekin bihar main bhaajapa ke liye acchhee baat yah he ki ab use bhi baraabar kaa darja hasil he
 After this encouraging result, it will be interesting to see the relationship between the two partners
 duusari ore lalu kaa janaadhar bikhar gaya he
 This is clearly his worst defeat ever, more than the party's defeat in 2005
 unki patni or purv mukhyamantri rabari devi donon jagah se haar gayi, jisase lalu kaa kharaab pradarshan jaahir hota he
 These results also prove that the NDA has strengthened its position since the 2009 general election
 use tab 40 main se 32 siten mili thim
 Lalu and Paswan have become isolated in the politics of Bihar, and are now left as leaders of their community
 ek ore jahaan rajd ko 22 siten milin vahiin lojpa ko keval teen par santosh karnaa padaa
 Lalu and Paswan are now away from power in Bihar for five years
 centre main avaanchit kii unki sthiti se unka patan or tej ho gaya he
 They are also losing their importance in national politics
 duusari ore, congress mukhya vipakshi kii bhoomika nibhaane kii ummid kar rahi thi
 But because of the crushing defeat — he got only four seats — all his hopes were shattered
 alpsankhyakon kaa sabase bada varg spasht rup se rajg ke peeche lamaband ho gaya he; isi tarah mahadlit or ati pichhadi jatiyaan bhi uski samarthak hai
 The signs of development also inspired the people of Bihar to go beyond religion and caste to vote for development
 pehali baat, behtareen or chikani sadakon se rajya ke vibhinn saamaajik or aarthik varg main nitish kii apil janch gai
 He got an edge in the elections due to the better condition of law and order and health services in the state
 nitish ko lambey safar kii shuruyaat kerani thi, kyonki kaaphi aage janaa he
 Bihar has drank development with Nitish's stunning victory
 rajya aakhirkaar bharat ke vikaas kii mukhyadhara main shaamil ho gaya he
 Even though Bihar is not fully glowing, its possibility cannot be ruled out
 lalit modi prakaran main pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue congress ne un par aarope lagaaya ki vah videshmantri sushamaa swaraj or rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ko bachaakar 'raaj dharm' nahin 'raaje dharm' nibhaa rahe hai
 Reiterating Congress's demand to remove Raje and Swaraj, party spokesperson Ajay Kumar told reporters here, 'the Prime Minister should follow Rajdharma rather than' Lalit Dharma 'or' Raje Dharma '
 ' Criticizing the Prime Minister, Kumar said that his response to the issue of corruption and black money after his promises made during the Lok Sabha elections was 'very disappointing'
 unhone aarope lagaaya, 'in muddon par kadam uthaane kii jagah modi, jinke paas kaala dhan he unke sangrakshak ho gaye hai
 ' kumaar kii yah tippanee kuch dinon tak samarthan main aawaaj nahin uthne ke baad bhaajapa kendriya netritv ke raaje ke bachaav main aage aane kii prishthbhumi main ai he
 The comments haalanki, rajasthan bhaajapa ne un par lage sabhi aaropon ko yah kehete hue khaarij kiya he ki ipel ke purv pramukh lalit modi ke avrajan aavedan ke samarthan main jis dastavej par raaje ne dastakhat kiya use unhone kisi adaalat main pesh nahin kiya
 However, the Congress spokesperson contended that Raje has acted 'anti-national' by secretly supporting Lalit Modi's immigration application
 unhone daawa kiya isse bhaajapa kaa 'chhadam rashtrawaad' ujagar ho gaya he

 Kumar's remarks came against the backdrop of bjp's central leadership coming forward in defense of Raje after not voicing support for a few days
 tippaniyan However, the Rajasthan BJP has rejected all the allegations leveled against them, saying that the documents that Raje signed in support of the immigration application of former IPL chief Lalit Modi did not produce it in any court
 haalanki, congress pravaktaa ne daleel di ki lalit modi ke avrajan aavedan kaa gupt rup se samarthan kar raaje ne 'raashtra-virdohi' kaam kiya he
 This, he claimed, has exposed the bjp's 'pseudo nationalism'

 Will you ever ask yourself? chaatr jivan main khape naujavaanon kaa kitna pratishat itihaas padhata hoga
 How many ancient history must have been read in history
 puraa jivan laga denge to bhi aap pracheen itihaas ke saare pahaluon ke bare main jaan nahin sakenge
 It is easy for politicians to say that they have been forgotten in history
 unhen sthaan nahin diya gaya
 It is true that when people do not study, how will they know likhane waalon ne to likhaa hi he
 If not written then it should be written yah to satat chalane vaali prakriya he
 Home Minister Amit Shah has said that the Left wrote, the British wrote, now they will write their history
 peshewar itihaas likhnaa hi chahie
 But with facts and references
 lathi se nahin, kalam se likhaa janaa chahie
 However, if you feel that the Gupta period has been neglected in historiography, then you can see this list

 a blast in Quetta city of Pakistan killed about 15 people and injured more than 20 people

 According to eyewitnesses, the first loud explosion shook the area and later the sound of firing was heard

 Police and rescuers also reached the spot after the explosion

 Sources in the security forces said that at the time of the blast, the polio teams were moving from the polio center towards the targeted areas

 The appearance of four judges of the Supreme Court in the media is a very unnatural incident
 chaaron jajon ne supreme court ke pradhan nyaayadhish par kaam ke bantwaare main varishton kii upeksha kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The level of the judiciary and democracy at which these allegations have been made is very serious and this has led the common man to speculate on the developments within the country's largest court, his imagination, which is making many times worse picture of what happened
 is dhundh kaa chantnaa jaruri he
 On May 7, 1997, the Supreme Court accepted the charter called Restatement of Value of Judicial Life for the consideration of the conduct of judges
 baad main ise sabhi hoicorton main bhi lagu kiya gaya
 One of the rules of this charter was that the judge would not come before the media and express his opinion, he would speak through the judgment
 saath hi jaj aisa koi kaam bhi nahin karegaa jisase logon kii nyaaypalika ke prati dharna kharaab ho
 On January 12, both of these Charter provisions were grossly violated
 agar jaj media ke saamne aae hai to unhen media ke un sawaalon kaa bhi saamana karnaa padegaa jo shaayad koi patrkaar apni jindagi main kabhi kisi jaj se karne kii himmat nahin uthaa paata
 Supreme Court judges are high-ranking legalists
 dhairya or bhaavnaatmak dridhtaa hameshaa kaayam rakhane kii ummid kii jaati he or agar paristhitiyaan vipareet hon to ye apeksha or bad jaati he
 But this did not happen on 12 January
 mukhya nyaayadhish ke prati asantosh jaahir karne se adaalat kaa saamaanya prashasan sawaalon se ghira
 All judges in the Supreme Court are of equal merit
 lekin vahaan bhi agar mahatvapurn or kam mahatvapurn keson ke bantwaare kii khinchataan hona nakaaratmak ishaara karata he
 If the judge who makes the allegations says that the Chief Justice is the First Amang Equals, then he should not complain that the cases are less and more important
 koun sa cese kis adaalat main chalegaa ye nirvivaad rup se sarvocch nyaayalay ke pradhan nyaayadhish kaa ekadhikaar he
 He is the Master of Roster
 chaaron jajon ne isko chunauti dete hue isamen loktantr kaayam karne kii baat kahi he
 But democracy should not spread too much so that discipline is wired
 media main aane vaale jajon ne press conference main faisla janata par choda he
 So now the matter of the public - if there is a decision from the Supreme Court, then the general public sees the judge's name later, first she trusts the biggest court
 janata ye nahin dekhati ki ye faisla kis nyaayadhish ne sunaaya he
 The issue was of more importance, so a decision on this should have been pronounced by another court
 pradhan nyaayadhish ke prashasnic adhikaar sarvopari hote hai or shaktiyon ko loktantr kaa rang diya jayega to desh ke or bhi sansthaaen vivaadon main aa jaaengi
 If democracy is raised in the army and police, the country will be in trouble
 koi bhi tantra ek anushaasan main kaam karata he or isamen daraar nahin padani chahie
 Some people are arguing that if such a voice should arise in the government too, then tell them that the head of the government has a solution to show such people to the outside and the government has the option to show the way out every five years
 Is near lekin nyaaypalika main aise koi vikalp nahin hote, uski sabase badi cheez uski pratishtha hoti he or pratishtha jaaegi to puri nyaaypalika kii jaaegi, bada yaa chota koi batch nahin paaegaa

 The quarrel over the dress code of girls in college is old

 There SRK Degree College has banned the burqa
 college kaa ek video saamne aayaa he jisamen principal chadi lekar burqe main ai chaatraon ko college se bhagaate nazar aa rahe hai
 These students say that they are being asked to take off the burqa at the bus stop and enter the college

 The police is asking the girls wearing the burqa that they go out to the bus stand and take off the burqa

 He became the richest man in India
 gautam adani ne bhi bich main hi college chhod diya or ambani kii tarah arbapati bane
 There are many more examples of highly successful entrepreneurs who have dropped out of university studies
 badakismati se zyaadaatar log apwaad nahin hote or na hi ve jabardast pratibhavan hi hote hai, saath hi unamem udhyam kshamta kaa bhi abhaav hota he
 For most people, a good education in a university is the passport to success
 aap puch sakate hai ki aisi post graduate digriyon (eme, emessi, emcom or emphil, piechdi) kaa kya phayda he jo emb kii tarah naukari dilaane vaali peshewar yogyata se las na kar sake? jawaab he, iske kaaphi phaayde hai
 That is why India Today decided to conduct a special university survey and ranking in 2010 to assess the quality of universities in India that offer post-graduate degrees in arts, commerce and science
 apane tisare sanskaran main india today-nilsan survey bharat ke 50 sheersh vishvavidhyalayon (survey kiye gaye 160 main se) kii ranking kar rahaa he
 Like our hands-on college survey, this ranking has also emerged as a magical scale for students, parents and people associated with education across the country
 is saal pehali baar ham paanch sabase teji se ubharate or paanch sabase bade pichhadon kii suchi bhi alag se de rahe hai
 We have also listed five top universities by region
 pashchim kii viksit arthvyavasthaaon main vishvavidhyalay kii grajuation kii degree aam taur par acchhee naukari paane ke liye kaaphi he
 Graduation degree in India is rarely enough to get an attractive job
 ho saktaa he ki jane-maane vishvavidhyalayon ke gine-chune nami college naukari dilaa paane main madadgaar hote hon
 But in such a degree the degree of post graduation can show
 yah isliye nahin ki eme yaa emessi kii padhai kar lene se bhavi niyokta kii najar main sambhavit karmchaaree kii utpaadakta bad jaati ho
 But the additional degree the person possesses indicates his or her ability to be more capable
 america arthshaastri maaikel spence ko apane in vichaaron ke liye nobel puraskaar mil chukaa he
 This is the reason why students from top ranked universities get better jobs than lower ranked universities
 isliye nahin ki unhone adhik yaa behatar gunvattta vaali padhai kii he, balki isliye ki unhone (dusron kii tulana main) sheersh rank vaale vishvavidhyalay main atirikt degree ke liye admician lekar apni ucch kshamta ko darshaya he
 Reputation is not often seen, nor can it be guessed
 nilsan ke saath saajhedaari main india today ke shreshth vishvavidhyalayon ke survey main bharat ke shreshth vishvavidhyalayon kii reating ke liye vyapak fieldwork or aankadon kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 This includes subjective criteria (such as the opinion of top academics across the country) and objective criteria (teacher-student ratio, courses to be conducted, etc
)
 2011 kii hi tarah dilli vishvavidhyalay is baar bhi sheersh par he
 It is followed by Banaras Hindu University, Calcutta University and Jawaharlal Nehru University
 ye sabhi vishvavidhyalay pichley saal bhi sheersh 5 main shaamil the
 There has been a slight change in his rank, but he has come a long way in building his reputation and reaching from bottom to top
 sheersh paanch main nayaa naam aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay (eemyu) kaa he
 To some extent, one of the reasons is that some universities like Mumbai, iisc-bangalore and Pune could not provide factual data due to some of their constraints, due to which they could not be included in our survey
 lekin yah bhi sahi he ki eemyu kaa is tarah aage aana yah darshata he ki yah vishvavidhyalay apni puraani pratishtha phir se hasil karne kii jaddojahad main he
 It is possible that there will be little commentary on the rank of various universities but hardly any question will be raised on its overall trend
 viksit arthvyavasthaaon main aam taur par log us samay hi postagraduate degree kaa rukh karte hai jab unhen shodh yaa shikshan se jude kariyar main janaa hota he
 Universities in India also need a lot of teachers

 Unfortunately, in the mid-2000s, there was a period when some such institutions were created overnight that had achieved deemed university status without meeting the highest standards of quality
 saubhaahgya se us daur ko ham peeche chhod aae hai
 Now some of the country's leading industrialists are investing in universities and their aim is to turn them into global destinations of excellence

 And in this way only India will benefit
 tarika: kaise anjaam di gai rankingindia today kaa nilsan company ke saath kala, vigyaan or vaanijya vishyon ke bharat ke shreshth vishvavidhyalayon kii pahchaan ke liye yah teesraa survey he
 Only those universities are preferred where postgraduate courses in arts, science and commerce are offered
 is surveykshan main rashtriya mahatv ke un sansthaanon ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya he jo kisi ek kshetra jaise ejineering, medicine, lau yaa patrakarita aadi main visheshgyata rakhte hai
 For this reason Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) or National Institute of Technology (NIT) are excluded from the list
 rank kaa pataa lagane ke liye avadharanatmak score (academik visheshgyon se liye gaye gahan saakshaatkaar) or vastuparak score (vishvavidhyalayon dwaara muhaiyaa karaae gaye tathyaatmak aankade) ko milakar banaae gaye ek pha rmule kii madad lee gai
 Step 1: In-depth interviews were conducted with experts to confirm the standards at which universities are to be assessed at the end of the study
 in maanakon main pratishtha, academik sansaadhan, faikalti, shodh prakaashan / pariyojnaayen, buniyadi dhaancha, placement ke avasar or ucch shiksha ke liye panjikaran shaamil hai
 Step 2: Desk research was done to get the list of universities for the survey
 internet, prakashit report or association for indian uniwarsities kii handbook jaise gaun stroton kaa istemaal bhi kiya gaya
 After this an overall list of more than 160 universities was prepared
 charan 3:in 160 vishvavidhyalayon kii suchi 337 visheshgyon (dean, register, reader or professor) ke saamne rakhi gai or ghoshit maanakon ke aadhaar par unase inaki reating karne ke liye kaha gaya
 These experts were prohibited from rating their university
 unhen die gaye maanakon ke aadhaar par vishvavidhyalayon ko 100 ank baantne ke liye kaha gaya
 Additional importance was given to each standard which was decided based on the average rating given by the experts
 is tarah sabase ahm maanak ko sabase zyada mahatv or sabase kam ahm maanak ko sabase kam mahatv diya gaya tha
 On the basis of importance, the five key parameters were determined by the total perceptual score of a university based on ratings given by experts
 is kavayad ke ant main sheersh 75 vishvavidhyalayon kii ek suchi nikalakar ai
 Step 4: We collected factual information from these top 75 universities
 inamen se 50 ne apane aankade hamase saz kiye
 These figures were related to infrastructure, placements, academic resources, research and publication and faculty
 aakhri ranking prakriya main un vishvavidhyalayon ko shaamil nahin kiya jinhone apane aankade muhaiyaa nahin karaae the
 Step 5: After taking the opinion of the experts in Phase 3, we took the weightage of the conceptual and factual information
 kul score paane ke liye avadharanatmak score ko 50 fisadi or tathyaatmak score ko bhi 50 fisadi vettege diya gaya
 After weighing these weightages, the scores were listed on the basis of 100 points

 The Indian government describes it as a 'victory', but Westminster Magistrate Court Chief Magistrate Emma Arbhanot's decision to extradite billionaire fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya to India does not mean that Mallya will soon be behind bars
 arbthanot kaa aadesh mahaj vahaan ke grih mantri sajid javed ke liye sifarish kii tarah hi he or pratyrpan kaa antim faisla unhen hi lenaa he
 Mallya can apply against the Arbhannot decision within two weeks
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah bhale daawey karen ki yah pradhanmantri narendra modi ke liye ek jeet he, lekin abhi maamla anishchit he, kyonki oonchi adaalat main haar sambhav he
 Not only this, Mallya will still have to go through many bureaucratic and legal hurdles before being presented to an Indian judge
 apane aadesh main arbthanot ne kaha ki 'pratham drushtya' yah maamla dikhataa he ki maalya ke kingfisher airlines ko die gaye idibiai bank ke karj kaa durupyog kiya gaya or unhone apane prabhaav kaa istemaal karte hue bank afasaron se jhooth bolaa
 The court also rejected Mallya's claim that his case was political and that his trial in India would not go on impartially
 maalya ke is daawey ko bhi khaarij kar diya gaya ki bhartiya jelon kii vyavastha kaaphi ghatiya he
 Advocate Pramod Nair, working in both India and the UK, argues that Mallya will have many opportunities to appeal, but "a detailed and considered decision of the magistrate's court can prove to be quite persuasive
" ''taatkaalik prakriya ke rup main britain ke grih mantralay ne is baat kii pushti kar di he ki use court kaa aadesh mil chukaa he
 Mallya has been given four weeks to appeal his defense, after which the Home Minister will decide in two months
 is samay seemaa ko badhaane ke liye bhi vah apil kar saktaa he
 After the extradition order is confirmed, Vijay Mallya can first appeal to the High Court and then to the Supreme Court
 sibiai ke ek varisht vakil ne apana naam jaahir na karne kii shart par bataaya ki arbthanot kaa aadesh bas ''kai kadamon main se pehla kadam hi he
 At least not immediately
 ''nishchit rup se maalya agar apil ke liye aavedan nahin karata he, to use grih mantri ke nirnay ke 28 dinon ke bheetar pratyrpit kar diya jayega, lekin itani aasaani se yah sab nahin ho saktaa
 "it is a daydream to bring Mallya back before the general election," a source close to the proceedings told
 ''maalya ke khilaaf aapraadhik kaarywahi par sabaki nigahen hai or yah masalaa ek rajnatik footbal ban gaya he, lekin is maamle main pragati britain se pratyrpan hasil karne kii behad dhimi prakriya par nirbhar he
 In January last year, the Bangalore-based debt recovery tribunal ordered United Breweries Holdings Limited, of which Mallya is still the chairman, to repay a loan of Rs 6,203 crore to a consortium of 15 banks led by the State Bank of India and that too 11
 5 fisadi ke salanaa byaaj ke saath
 a month later, the Karnataka High Court held a hearing on an order to consolidate the functioning of the UBHL
 ubchael ne court ko bataaya ki uskaa asset kareeb 15,000 karod ru
 Rs
 3,500 crore remaining
 ke puure karj ko chukaane ke liye kaaphi he, lekin uski kai parisampattiyon ko pravartan nideshaalay ne kurk kar rakhaa he
 Several banks then went to the tribunal to order the ED to free Mallya's assets so that the debt could be recovered
 aktubar main ek tribunel ne kaha ki maalya kii property par bainkon kaa pehla adhikaar he
 But the ED insisted that the attachment property cannot be sold while the criminal case is going on
 britain kii magistrate ke haalia aadesh ke baad, esbiai ke chairman rajnish kumaar ne kaha ki pratyrpan se karj vasuuli kii prakriya tej ho sakati he
 But lawyers familiar with the matter disagree
 ek varisht vakil ne naam na jaahir karne kii shart par kaha, ''court agar apane tatwadhan main nibatare ke prastaav par sahamat hota he, to yah karj kaa kam se kam kuch hissaa hasil karne kaa sabase suvidhajanak tarika ho saktaa he
 If this is not done, it can be decided by the process of consolidating the functioning of the company that the banks will be able to get the amount
 ''philhal sach yah he ki maalya ko bhartiya court main ghaseetne yaa bainkon ke karj kaa kuch hissaa vasuulne, donon kaa rasta abhi lanbaa he
 It remains to be seen what strict steps the government takes against this fugitive economic criminal

 bhartiya cricket team dakshin africa ke khilaaf new wanders maidan par mili ek ran kii romaanchak jeet ke baad new lands maidan par khele jane vaale shrinkhalaa ke tisare ekadivasiy mukaable main mangalvaar ko badhat banane ke iraade se utregi
 On the other hand, South Africa would also like to win here
 paanch maichon kii ekadivasiy shrinkhalaa main donon timen 1-1 kii barabari par hai
 The injury to the players of Team India is a matter of concern for the team
 shrinkhalaa ke pichley do muqablon main bhartiya ballebaaji flop rahi he jabaki shanivaar ko khele gaye mukaable main bhartiya team ne gendbaajon ke shandaar pradarshan kii badaulat jeet hasil kii thi
 Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni's problems have increased as the master blaster Sachin Tendulkar, who returned to ODI cricket after nearly 11 months, was ruled out of the rest of the series due to a hamstring injury
 salaami ballebaaj virendra sahvaag, gautam gambheer, or praveen kumaar ke baad sachin chauthe khilaadi hai jo chot ke kaaran vartmaan shrinkhalaa se baahar hue hai
 India have played two odis against South Africa at the New Lands ground in Cape Town so far and have lost in both the matches
 bharat ko 1992 main khele gaye pehle ekadivasiy mukaable main dakshin africa ne chah wicket se haraaya tha jabaki 2006 main khele gaye mukaable main mejabaan team ne mehmaan team ko 106 ranon se maat di thi
 From this point of view, the pan of South Africa is heavy on this ground
 bharat ne haal main sampann teen test maichon kii shrinkhalaa ke duusare test match main dakshin africa ko kingsmid maidan par 87 ranon se haraaya tha or iske baad khele gaye antim or nirnaayak test match ko vah drow karaane main safal rahaa tha
 Thus in India, for the first time in South Africa, India won the Test series
 jabaki durban ke moses mahida stadium main khele gaye ekmaatr twanti-20 match main bhartiya team ne mejabaanon ko 21 ranon se shikast di thi
 The responsibility of batting in the Indian team will be on the shoulders of Parthiv Patel and Murali Vijay, who replaced Tendulkar
 haalanki vijay abhi tak team ko acchhee shuruyaat dene main asafal rahe hai
 Patel recently made a comeback to the home ODI series played with New Zealand after nearly six years
 patel ne bengaluru or chennai main khele gaye ekadivasiy maichon main kramash: 53 or 56 ranon kii pari kheli thi
 The responsibility of the middle order will be on the shoulders of Suresh Raina, Virat Kohli and Yuvraj Singh, while captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni would also like to play a big innings

 aise main ashanka he ki raahil sharif kii tarah vah bhi bharat ke prati sakht rukh apanaae rah sakate hai
 However, many experts say that it is too early to assess his attitude towards India
 vahiin pakistan ke nae senadhyaksh bajva ko kaaphi pehle se jaanane vaale bharat ke purv senadhyaksh bikram singh ne unase satark rahane kii salaah di he
 General Bajwa served as a brigade commander in the United Nations Mission in Congo in 2007 under General Bikram Singh
 bikram singh ne bajva ko 'puraa peshewar' or 'utkrisht pradarshan vaala' sainya afasar bataaya
 He says his performance at the United Nations was commendable, but things changed when a military officer returned to his country

 bajva ke paas pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir (pioke) or uttari kshetron main vyapak bhaagadari ke kaaran niyantran rekha se jude maamalon kaa maahir mana jaataa he
 In such a situation, it is feared that like Raheel Sharif, he too can keep a strict attitude towards India

 agar aap nivesh karne ke bare main soch rahe hai to maujuuda samay aapke liye sabase behtareen sabit ho saktaa he
 Because the Lok Sabha elections are close and there is a huge amount of cash flow in the economy during the election, which makes the wheel of the economy dynamic
 aise main jo log nivesh karke paisa bananaa chaahate hai unke liye yah ek behtareen mauka sabit ho saktaa he
 This, says Ashutosh Bishnoi, managing director (MD) and (CEO) of Mahindra Mutual
 unka kahana he, 'notebandi or jiesti ke kaaran arthvyavastha thodi ruk si gai thi
 At first, there was no money in the hands of the people and then the supply also decreased
 tab kanjumar demand jo ruk gai thim, wo ab bahut teji se aage aa rahi hai
 In such a situation, the profits of companies are also increasing
 pichley 6 maheene ke corporate riglts dekhakar yah samajha ja saktaa he ki kai sectoron main munafa teji se bad rahaa he
 'he said,' The budget has also been such that will encourage people to spend, in such a way the demand of people will increase and this will also increase the profits of companies
 vahiin duusari taraf companiyon kii cost ghat rahi he
 Oil prices have come down, the price of industrial commodities like steel-copper is at the lowest level ever
 aise main aane vaale samay main bhi companiyon kii laagat ghategi or munafa badhegaa
 So, this time is very good for investing in good companies
 har inwaster ko chunaav ko investment ke maukey ke taur par dekhnaa chahie
 Ashutosh said, "if you invest in SIP, you can also increase it
 agar har maheene ek esaypi kar rahe hai or agar aapke paas thode or paise hon to do esaypi daalane lagen
 If we look at the debt market ie fixed income funds, then its rates are getting reduced
 rate kam hone kaa matlab he ki aapke fund kii vailu bad rahi he
 This series will still go on
 'unhone kaha, 'agle 6-8 maheenon main rate badhane kii koi sambhaavna najar nahin aa rahi he
 It is more likely that the rate will decrease
 agar pichley ek-do saalon kaa karporate bond fund kaa ritern dekhen to 11-12 fisadi ke kareeb ho chukaa he
 7 also in liquid funds
 25-7
 It is getting a return of 5, even the risk is equal to this
 aise main jo log lambey samay ke liye market main hai, wo apana esaypi karte rahen
 'before investing, you need to pay attention to these 3 things: * Is the business of this company good? For this you will have to look at the balance sheet of the company for many years
 * company kaa vailuation market main kaisaa he?company kaa bijness bahut badhiya ho saktaa he, lekin jaruri nahin he ki market main use vailuation mila ho, yani company ko profit to hota he, lekin jaruri nahin he ki stock market main company kaa naam dikh rahaa ho
 Many times the opposite is also true that the company is not making profit at all, but its value is seen in the stock market
 aisi company dhundhani chahie, jisamen bijness or vailu donon badhiya hon
 * Is this the right time to invest? The most important thing is to see when to invest in which company or stock, time is a big factor
 aapako akalan karnaa hoga ki bazaar main iskaa wolum kitna he
 Which big investors are putting money in or withdrawing it
 yah technical analysis karnaa jaruri he ki kahin is samay nivesh karnaa ghate kaa sauda to nahin ho jayega

 eden gardens stadium main apana antim test match khel rahe mahaan ballebaaj sachin tendulkar, jab guuruuvaar ko west indies ke khilaaf 10 ke nijee yoga par shen shillingford dwaara pagabaadha out kiye to chaaron ore sannata chaa gaya
 Actually, Sachin Tendulkar became the victim of bad umpiring
 west indies ke gendbaaj shillingford kaa pradarshan prabhaavshaalee tha or unhone bharat kii mashhoor ballebaaji linep ko jhakzorne main koi kasar nahin chodi, lekin tendulkar kaa bhagya ne saath nahin diya or ampire nigel long ne unhen galat pagabaadha out diya
 There is no doubt that Shillingford dodged Tendulkar, who had announced his retirement, with his 'doosra', but the ball hit his upper thigh
 tivi riple se lag rahaa tha ki gend unke stump ke upar se nikal sakati thi
 Tendulkar scored 10 runs and looked good in touch
 unhone ampire kii anguli uthne se pehle do chauke lagaae the
 The audience did not believe for a moment that Sachin was out, but when the truth was faced, expressions of disappointment could be seen on his face
 darshak sachin se badi pari kii ummid kar rahe the
 The audience then stood in honor of Sachin returning to the pavilion
 sachin sir jhukaae apane stroke chayan par afsos karte pavilion laute
 Every eye was towards the pavilion end and at each sight there was regret of not seeing Sachin's batting for a long time
 iske baavjood darshakon ne is mahaan khilaadi kaa taaliyon ke saath abhinandan diya
 When Sachin came on the wicket, the view was completely opposite
 murali vijay kaa wicket girane ke baad jaise hi sachin ballebaaji ke liye maidan par aae to puraa eden gardens stadium maano ji uthaa
 The opening 45 minutes of the morning session did not go well for India
 shikhar dhawan or murali ke saste main out hone ke baad cheteshwar pujaara kaa saath dene sachin wicket par aae
 About 40 thousand spectators present in Eden at that time, as if waiting for this moment
 darshakon ne sachin ke wicket par aate hi joardaar garjana kii
 It was heard from Esplanade metro station, one kilometer from the roaring stadium
 metro or bason se stadium tak pahunch rahe darshak isse utsahit ho gaye
 The spectators who were outside the stadium understood that Sachin had arrived
 kisi ko bharat ke do wicket ganvaane kaa gam nahin tha
 Security personnel stationed at the entrances of the stadium were encouraging people to enter early
 kisi ne marathi main kaha-sachin aalaa re, to darshakon kaa ek samooh joro se hans padaa
 Sachin scored one run off the opening six balls
 iske baad drinks tak unhone do chauke lagaae
 The excitement of the audience on every run was worth watching
 chaukon par to maanon puraa stadium ji uthta tha
 Had Sachin stayed on the wicket for lunch, then Eden was expected to be packed
 bengal cricket sangh ke adhikariyon ne bhi buudhvaar ko kaha tha ki ve guuruuvaar ko eden ke liye sabase bade din kii ummid kar rahe the
 Given India's poor condition in the first innings, Sachin is expected to bat in the second innings as well and this hope will force the spectators to come to Eden on the third or fourth day
 sachin apane antim ranjai match main bhi saat ranon par out ho gaye the, lekin phir unhone haryana ke rohtak main haryana ke khilaaf 79 ranon kii naabad pari khelkar mumbai ko jeet dilaai thi
 In Eden too, viewers will expect a similar innings from Sachin
