 Recently there were reports that actress Vidya Balan would play the role of Benazir in a biopic on the late Prime Minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto
 lekin afsos aisa mumkin nahin ho paaegaa, kyonki benazir bhutto kii zindagi par banane vaali kisi bhi film ke adhikaar unke pati or unke parivaar ke paas hai
 Consequently, any filmmaker can think of making this film under the close supervision of Bhutto's husband Asif Ali Zardari and his family
 gauratlab he ki benazir kii hatya ke baad disambar, 2007 main shabana aazmi benazir kii byopic kaa hissaa banane vaali thim
 Mahesh Bhatt was to direct this indo-pak production
 yah film bhi unke pati zaradaari kii dakhsandaazi kii vajah se ban nahin pai thi
 Apart from this, Sushmita Sen was also to play the role of Benazir Bhutto on the big screen
 lekin is film ke nirmaan ko bhi rokna padaa tha
 In such a situation, given the current situation, it can be said that Vidya will probably not be seen in Bhutto's role anymore
 sirf benazir hi kyon haal hi main vidya ne gayika emes subbalakshmi par banane vaali byopic kaa hissaa banane se bhi inkaar kar diya tha

 And despite this, many had to return disappointed
 nobel puraskaar paa chuke is dharm guru ne jab sambodhit kiya to kuch aisa kaha jo desh ke liye gaurav kii baat he
 The Dalai Lama said, 'india is our Guru
 ' or 'ham iske chele hai
 Everything we have learned, known, achieved, has reached us only from India
 'buddhavaad kaa vigyaan se naate se lekar bhrashtachar or dharmanirpekshata ke bare main baat karke dalai lamas ne yah bhi joda ki main 77 varsh kaa ho gaya hum or bhi sansar kii khoj main hum
 Tibetan Religion Guru Dalai Lama said, 'I always try to learn what i can learn
 ' british upanyaaskaar pico lir se baat karte hue dalai lamas ne kaha ki main ab bhi khud kaa ek vidhyaarthee samajhataa hum
 After the session, the Lama responded to questions about the nature of Indian society, particularly about the gang-rape incident, which had united young Indians on the streets
 dalai lamas ne kaha, mujhe lagata he ki ek bade shahar main, 24 ghante main, koi na koi katl yaa rape kii ghatana ghatati hi he
 These things always happen
 nirbhar karata he ki ham in ghatnaon ko kis tarah dekhte hai
 The lama says, 'truly, when someone kills one, we call him a murderer, but when someone kills thousands, we call him a hero
 ' haalanki vah rape ke aarope main maut kii sajaa se sahamat to nahin hai, par kehete hai yah to desh ke kanoon kaa maamla he, desh ko hi sochna he ki is tarah kii ghatnaon ke baad kis tarah ke kadam uthaae jane sahi honge
 Every country can determine this in its own way
 phir bhi, vah kehete hai ki is tarah kii samasyaon se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye samaaj main asamanta ko kam karne kii taraf kadam uthaae jane chahie, kanoon vyavastha sahi ho or jaagarukta badhaai jaani chahie
 Dharma Guru says, yes it is necessary that there should be special security system for women
 lekin mukhya suraksha shiksha hi ho sakati he
 Only education can bring change in society
 tibet ke is dharm guru ko china kii taraf se hameshaa nakaara jaataa rahaa he, is bare main jab unase sawaal kiya gaya to unhone kisi bhi raajnneetik prashn kaa jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya
 He only said that he has retired now
 dalai lamas ne kaha ki bharat ko apane uttari padosiyon kaa saath paane ke liye koi upyukt rasta khojna hoga
 He said that this 21st century is a century of conversation
 bhootkaal kii tarah yadi aaj hinsa hoti he to yah donon pakshon ke liye vinaashkari sabit hogi
 
 
 Before finishing his talk, he said, we should remember 'hindi Chini Bhai Bhai'

 Dawood is in Karachi only
 ek baar phir ho gaya he iskaa khulaasa
 You might want to know who is the daughter-in-law of Dawood, where is the daughter-in-law of Don
 to ham aapako bataa den ki sania kaa taalluk landan se he or parivaar kaaphi rasukhdaar he
 The home of Moin Ibrahim, the only son of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, is settled
 23 sitambar 2011 ko daaud ke bete moin kii shaadi ho gai
 Moin is studying medicine
 don ke bete kii bahu bhi koi maamuli nahin he
 Sania is the daughter of a London-based businessman
 sutron ke mutabik moin or sania kii mulaakaat bhi landan main hi hui
 Sania is studying in London and the intention is that Moin and Sania will stay in London ahead
 is bare main daaud kaa bhai anis ibrahim ne kaha ki bhai (daaud ibrahim) kaa armaan tha ki uske bete kii dulhan koi maamuli na ho
 And Moin Ibrahim, Dawood's only son, fulfilled this promise of him
 don kii har mehfil kii tarah ye bete kii shaadi kaa jashn bhi shandaar tha
 Dawood Ibrahim's bungalow White House in the Clifton area of karachi was also decorated like a bride
 halaki aisa kaha ja rahaa he ki isse bhi bada jashn aane vaale dinon main ek resepshan main manaaya jaaenga
 This was confirmed by d Company in a phone conversation with Aaj Tak
 aatank kii duniya kaa behad khaufnak naam or bharat kaa dushman number ek daaud ibrahim kareeb 2000 behad khaas mehmaanon ke sang khushi se jhum rahaa tha
 Dawood's bungalow was playing the clarinet in the White House
 ek se ek lajij or chuninda pakwaanon kii daavat ho rahi thi
 Because Dawood Ibrahim's son Moin Ibrahim was getting married to Sania, the daughter of a London business man
 anderworld don ne apane iklaute bete kii shaadi badi dhoomdhaam se karne kaa armaan paal rakhaa tha
 Dawood wanted that when Moin brought the bride, it would be a grand event, the native foreign guests would attend the wedding, and such a feast, such a dance song that the world would keep watching
 lekin khoonkhaar aatankwaadi osama bin laden kii maut ne daaud ke armaanon par pani pher diya
 Osama's death forced Dawood to stifle his dream of marrying his son with pomp
 isliye 23 sitambar ko pakistan main karachi ke clifan main maujuud daaud ke bangale white house main jab moin ibrahim kii shaadi hui to kaaphi saavdhaanee barti gai
 - Although around 2000 guests attended Moin's wedding, but it was attended by the same people who are very close to Dawood
 - halanki moin kii shaadi main 2000 ke kareeb mehmaanon ne shirkat kii lekin isamen vahi log shaamil hue jo daaud ke kaaphi kareebi hai
 Most of the guests at the wedding were from the girl side
 - shaadi main anis ibrahim, chota shakeel maujuud tha

 yahi kaaran he ki unhone apane mitra or gudgaanv ke suresh agarwal ke saath ganatantr diwas ke maukey par bharat ke samvidhan ko sakshi maanakar bangkok main vivaah rachaaya
 The early life of Nisha's parents, a resident of Chikhala, a small village in Balaghat, Tehsil Kiranpur, was full of struggles

 Nisha said that she wants to give a message to the society that thousands of marriages are broken despite many practices and fire breaks and the two families keep circling the courtroom, saying that the constitution is witnessing marriage
 
 unhen khushi he ki unke pati ne bhi samvidhan ke prati atoot vishwaas darshaya
 Overwhelmed by this, he decided to marry, considering the Constitution as a witness

 The failure is not giving up the pursuit of Virender Sehwag
 balle ke saath isi naakaami ke kaaran sahvaag beete ek saal se bhartiya team se baahar hai
 Sehwag played the last Test match for India in March 2013 and his last a-day match was held in January 2013
 iske baad vah lagbhag ek darjan se adhik pratham shrenee or list-e mukaable khel chuke hai, lekin unke balle kii dhar ab tak nahin laut pai he
 It was expected that Sehwag would be able to regain the shine of his bat through the Visar Hazare Trophy (north Zone), but he failed miserably in two matches of this tournament
 sahvaag 27 farvari ko firozshah kotla maidan par jammu-kashmir ke khilaaf 15 ran bana sake the, jabaki shanivaar ko punjab ke khilaaf unke balle se sirf 10 ran nikle
 Earlier, Sehwag played a total of seven Ranji matches in the last season, but in a single match, he did not get a hundred off his bat
 14 disambar, 2013 ko dilli main vidarbha ke khilaaf unhone 56 ran banaae the, jo beete ranjai satr main unka sarvocch score tha
 Sehwag scored 1 and 15 in two innings against Gujarat, 9 against Mumbai and 35 not out, 3 and 6 against Haryana, 0 and 44 against Odisha, 10 and 12 against Punjab and 32 and 11 runs against Karnataka

 He was replaced by Shikhar Dhawan in the Test team and made a brilliant hundred in March 2013 in Mohali
 sahvaag beeti 10 test pariyon main ek bhi shatak nahin laga sake hai, jabaki beeti ek darjan ek-divasiy pariyon main unke balle se sirf ek ardhashatak niklaa
 Sehwag has two triple centuries in Test matches and the highest individual innings (219) in odis
 kharaab form ke kaaran haalanki dhire-dhire sahvaag kii vaapasi kii raah mushkil hoti ja rahi he or saath hi saath unki sammanjanak vidaai kii sambhaavna bhi kamjor hoti ja rahi he
 Sehwag has scored the fastest triple century and fastest double century in Test matches
 kam se kam footwork par vah sabase sateek scwater drive khilne ke maahir hai
 There is a great synergy between his eyes and hands and that is why he has the ability to deliver good balls outside the boundary
 aaj kii taarikh main sahvaag kaa yah adbhut gun unka saath nahin de rahaa he or isi kaaran vah match dar match naakaam hote chale ja rahe hai

 ye unke daftar main kaam kar rahe ek karmchaaree kaa number he

 Despite Saina Nehwal's convincing win, India had to settle for a silver medal with a 1-3 defeat to defending champions Malaysia in the final of the Commonwealth Games badminton mixed team event
 siri fort khel parisar par bharat kii ore se cyna ne ek game se pichhadane ke baad vaapasi karte hue mu chu vong ko 24-26, 21-17, 21-14 se haraaya jabaki baaki teen muqablon main mejabaan desh ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 However, he got a silver medal

 In such a situation, it has become mandatory to have elections for one seat in the state
 bijepi ne 9wein ummidavaar ke taur par gajiabad ke shaikshanik vyavsaayee anil agarwal ko rajyasabha kaa ummidavaar banaaya he
 BJP state president Mahendra Nath Pandey said that the party is getting 28 votes after winning 8 candidates
 aise main nirdaleey vidhayakon ke saath milakar hamaare 9wein ummidavaar kii jeet tay he
 Explain that the opposition has united in the state on the pretext of Rajya Sabha elections
 basapa akele apane 19 vidhayakon ke dam par rajyasabha chunaav nahin jeet sakati
 In such a situation, SP, Congress and RLD have declared their support
 iske baad basapa pratyaashee bhimrao ambedkar ke rajyasabha pahunchane kii raah main bijepi ke 9wein ummidavaar ne roda atka diya he
 There are 403 members in 8 BJP, one SP and one seat in the UP Assembly, out of which 402 mlas will vote for 10 Rajya Sabha seats
 rajyasabha chunaav jeetne ke liye ek sadsy ko 37 vidhayakon kaa samarthan chahie
 According to this figure, the BJP alliance has one seat fixed in the account of SP with 8 and 47 mlas
 10veen or aakhri seat ke liye sapa ke 10 atirikt vot, bispi ke 19, congress ke 7 or 3 anya ke saath milakar ek ummidavaar ko jita sakate hai
 BJP has so far announced 8 candidates, whose victory is confirmed
 jabaki vipaksh kii ore se sapa ne jaya bachchan ko ummidavaar banaaya he, unki bhi jeet tay he
 In the way of the BSP, the Kantebjp has made trouble in front of BSP candidate Bhimrao Ambedkar by taking Anil Aggarwal for the Rajya Sabha on the last day
 sapa, congress or areldi ke samarthan ke baad ab unki bhi jeet tay maani ja rahi thi
 But now elections are to be held
 mana ja rahaa he ki bijepi apane 9wein ummidavaar ke liye nirdaleey vidhayakon ko saath laakar vipaksh kii ekajutata ko fail karne ranneeti banaai he
 The arithmetic of the Rajya Sabha is a fixed formula for the Rajya Sabha elections, divided by the total number of members of the assembly by an addition in the vacant seats
 nishkarsh main bhi ek jodne par jo sankhya aati he
 The same number of votes is required for a member to win the Rajya Sabha election
 agar upi kaa udhaaharan liya jaae to 10 siton main 1 joda jaae to yoga hua 11
 Now dividing 403 by 11 then it comes to 36
 63
 If 1 is added to it, the sum is 37
 63
 That is, a member needs the support of 38 mlas to win the UP Rajya Sabha elections
 haalanki chunki ek vidhayak kaa nidhan ho chukaa he isliye yahaan 37 vidhayakon ke samarthan se hi rajyasabha ummidavaar kii jeet tay ho jaaegi

 pulavama hamale ke baad bharat ne bhale hi pakistan jane vaali teen nadiyon kaa pani rokane kii baat kahi ho, lekin bharat ke is kadam se pakistan par koi asar nahin padegaa
 This is to say of Khwaja Shumail, Secretary, Ministry of Water Resources of Pakistan
 pakistani akhbaar don ko die intervyuu main khwaja shumil ne kaha ki bharat purvi nadiyon kaa pani yadi rokegaa to uskaa pakistan par koi asar nahin padegaa
 Because these rivers come under the authority of India under Indus Agreement
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki yadi bharat teenon nadiyon ke pani ko divert karke apane logon ke liye istemaal karata he to is kadam par pakistan ko koi bhi aapatti nahin he
 India has the right over the waters of Ravi, Sutlej and Beas under the Indus Water Agreement
 pani rokane par kya kaha tha gadakari ne
 
 
 It is worth noting that Union Minister Nitin Gadkari had said in a program that the water of Ravi, Beas and Sutlej coming under the Indus Water Agreement will be diverted to Yamuna
 jo ab tak pakistan main ja rahaa tha
 Diverting the water will provide water for irrigation in many states including Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Haryana and farmers will be able to grow a variety of crops
 in teenon project par pehle hi kaam shuru ho chukaa he
 Indus water agreement will not be affected
 
 
 kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ne aage kaha ki teenon nadiyon kaa pani diawart karne kii yojana dirghakaalik he
 Which will not affect the Indus Water Agreement
 aane vaale 6 saalon main yah yojana puri hogi
 The construction of dams on the rivers has started
 maaloom ho ki nitin gadakari pakistan ja rahe bharat ke hisse ke pani ko diawart karne kii baat pehle bhi kah chuke hai
 However, his statement came at a time when there is tension between India and Pakistan over Pulwama

 aap aajkal dating main vyast hai, lekin aap donon ke bich anban hoti rahati he
 You like her very much and she is you
 lekin phir bhi na chaahate hue aap donon ke bich kahasuni ho hi jaati he or vah aapaki baton se naaraaz ho kar chale jate hai yaa phir baat karnaa band kar dete hai
 You keep wondering what has happened to him that he got so uprooted
 gaahe bagaahe aap unhen unke is vyavhaar ke liye kos bhi leti hongi, lekin jo baat ham aapako bataane ja rahe hai ho saktaa he ki aap use sun kar hairaan ho jaaen
 Yes, you blame them for getting angry at something, but the truth is that you do not know yourself what men like
 agar sachmuch aisa hi he, to jaaniye ki koun si aisi baaten he, jo aapkaa saathi kisi bhi haal main sunanaa nahin chahta
 If your partner is more worried about your figure, don't forget to tell him about your fatty food, which you ate last evening
 bhale hi vah aapse aapke puraane rishton ke bare main kitni hi poochtacha kar len
 But he would never want you to talk about his old love or ask for any explanation
 pichley maheene yaa saptaah kii kisi baat ko lekar agar aap unhen baar baar sawaalon main gherengi, to yakeen maniye vah aapse baat karne main bhi kataraane lagenge
 Often girls make the same mistake
 vah yah ki apane saathi se khud kii tarif sunne ke liye vah use apni tulana kisi duusari ladki se karne ko kahati hai
 Even then it is fine, but the consequences can be dangerous when she asks her to confront her own sister or a close relative
 agar aapkaa saathi kabhi bhavuk hokar apane bhavishya ke bare main baat kare, jisamen vah bacchon kaa zikr bhi kar de
 So do not take this lightly
 matlab saaf he ki vah aapako lekar gambhir he
 Do not take such things of their joke
 ek baat to sach he ki ladakon ke dimag main pyaar ke saath saath bistar ke sangeen pal bhi ghoomte rahete hai
 But never forget to ask him for clarification about whether he ever thinks about making a connection with someone else

 This is a big deal

 Captain Virat Kohli says, "you must have seen on the field, i was taking advice from MSD and Ashish Nehra
 haalanki test formet main main thodi captaini kar chukaa hum, lekin vanade or tii20 main game teji se badalte hai

 " Virat is particularly keen on captain Dhoni

 Top BCCI officials including Board President Shashank Manohar and Delhi and District Cricket Association chief Arun Jaitley held a meeting to draft the Cricket Board on the show cause notice of the ICC on the matter
 pich prakaran ke baad bharat or srilanka ke bich paanchvaan or antim ek divasiy antarrashtriya match radd kar diya gaya tha kyonki dilli kii pich khilne ke liye khatarnaak paayi gayi thi
 According to BCCI sources, in response to this, the board stressed that while the pitch may have been 'bad', it was not completely 'unfit'
 ek sutara ne kaha, ‘‘mana ki agar pich kharaab thi, to aap sirf jurmaana dekar chhot sakate hai
 But if it is declared as 'unfit' to play, then it will be banned for a year or two and the board does not want to because Kotla is included in the 2011 World Cup venues
 ’’ isi ke mutabik bisisiai is puure prakaran par ek dastavej taiyaar kar rahi he or vah apni bahes kaa aadhaar ise hi banaayegi ki is match main khel 24 over tak khelaa gaya or iske baad hi adhikariyon ne match ko radd kiya
 According to sources, BCCI would prefer that 130 balls were thrown in this canceled match, out of which only seven balls were raised
 inamen se kuch khatarnaak rup se uchhali thi or kuch nichi rah gayi thi
 Interestingly, DDCA vice-president and former player Chetan Chauhan used the same logic and claimed that the match officials were in a hurry to cancel the match
 ek baar isisi ko bisisiai kaa jawaab mil jaayegaa to mukhya match referi ranjan madugale or isisi ke cricket mahaprabandhak dev richardsan is mudde par antim faisla karenge
 If this pitch is considered 'bad', then Ferozeshah Kotla can avoid a penalty of $ 15,000, along with a directive that appropriate corrective action be taken for the pitch
 vahiin agar pich khilne ke liye ‘anfit’ maani jaati he to kotla ko antarrashtriya maichon ke liye ek yaa do saal kaa nilambit kiya ja saktaa he

 During the campaigning for the recent assembly elections in Gujarat, visiting the temple-temple on behalf of Congress President Rahul Gandhi made a lot of headlines
 rahul or congress kii ore se ‘soft hindutv’ kii line pakadaney kii bhi khub charchaa hui
 It was during the Gujarat elections that Rahul's 'janaudhari Hindu' and 'shivbhakt' avatars also appeared
 gujarat main chunaav puraa hone tak congress main ye hichkichaahat bhi rahi ki kahin daanv ulta naa pad jaae
 It is different that to some extent in Gujarat this bet was effective for the Congress
 aise main sawaal ye he ki kya congress or team rahul aane vaale chunaavon main bhi soft hindutv kii usee line ko aage badhayegi jo gujarat me pakadi thi?gujratanttijey aane ke baad beshak congress gujarat main bahumat nahin paa saki lekin bijepi ko 100 siton se neeche rokkar majboot takkar dene main jarur kaamyaab rahi
 Congress and Team Rahul feel that their new policy adopted in Gujarat was effective and due to this, BJP could not redeem the issue of Hinduism in Gujarat
 ye bhi hakeekat he ki rahul gujarat main jahaan jahaan bade mandiron main darshan ke liye gaye, un vidhansabha kshetron main congress ko acchhee kamyaabi mili
 On the question of Rahul's temple visit, Congress spokesperson Raj Babbar reminds that Prabhat Pheri and Bhajan Kirtan Congress has been doing this for years, it is not new for the party
 ab yahaan sawaal ye uthta he ki kya ‘grand old party’ aane vaale chunaavon kii ranneeti bhi usee line ke ird gird bunegi jo usne gujarat chunaav main apanaai

 After 20 January, the first phase of the campaign can be started by Rahul Gandhi in Karnataka
 is daure ke liye karnataka congress ne apana prastaav taiyaar kar liya he, jisko rahul ke saath baithak main charchaa ke baad ghoshit kiya jayega
 There is only a possibility of altering a lot about the dates
 karnataka yatra ke pehle charan main rahul teen badi jagahon par jaaenge
 These places are being chosen in such a way that different sections can be linked together
 rahul pehle charan ke dauraan mysore, belgaum or bellari ja sakate hai
 Mysore - In addition to Rahul's small programs, a big youth conference is organized here
 ye shahar bengaluru ke kareeb he
 Mysore has been chosen for the youth conference in terms of technology and youth jobs
 belgaum- ye wo shahar he jahaan mahatma gandhi ko congress adhyaksh kii kaman saunpi gai thi
 Rahul can address the women's conference here
 bellari-ye jila adivaasiyon kii bahulata vaala he isliye yahaan congress kii ore se adivasee sammelan karnaa tay hua he
 Bellary also has considerable political importance for the Congress
 sonia gandhi ke videshi mul kaa mudda uthaate hue 1999 main isi seat se bijepi netaa sushamaa swaraj ne loksabhaa chunaav main unhen chunauti di thi
 At that time, the voters of Bellary had shown their trust in Sonia Gandhi and Sushma Swaraj had to face defeat in the elections
 rahul ke karnataka daure ke pehle charan main gujarat kii tarj par aadi vedant se sambandhit bada dharmik sthal shringery math bhi shaamil he
 Rahul's grandmother and former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi also visited Chikmagalur to visit the Shringeri Math
 indira ne chikmagalore se loksabhaa kaa chunaav bhi ladaa tha
 At that time, 10 candidates filled the form in front of Indira
 us chuwaav main sthaneey congress kaaryakartaaon ne vivaadit naaraa bhi lagaaya tha- “ek sherni das langur, chikmagalore-chikmagalore
 "in Karnataka, even in Karnataka, if you go to temples and monasteries and keep holding the line of soft Hindutva, then there is a possibility of its discussion in the political corridors

 When the Mughals ruled this country, the Kedarnath temple was buried under the snowy mountains
 400 saal aisa rahaa, magar mandir kii ek eent bhi nahin khiski
 If we go back even further, then there was paddy cultivation around here under the rule of Vikramaditya

 This information has come from the article of Geologist Ravindra Kumar Chaujar, who has done research in Kedarnath Valley

 'standing at a height of 11,742 feet above sea level, turning the needle of time a little past, one will see a wonderful sight: a forest bathed in greenery, brown rows of rocky slopes, the metamorphic peaks of mountains and a calm, slow pace
 The golden green grass forest stretches far along the banks of the waves of Mandakini flowing through it
 nakshe par nadi se lagbhag 100 meter dakshin main ek choti-si bindinuma akruti dikhti he: yah he kedarnath mandir, jo himalay main aae pralay kaa sakshi ban gaya
 During my 20 years of research and field work on the Himalayan region of Garhwal, the serene calm image of Kedarnath is living in my mind

 It is said that this Shiva temple of Kedarnath was built by five Pandavas during the Mahabharata period

 saftware profeshnals kaa bhi kahana he ki agar iviem ke program main ek khaas code tip kar diya jaae to vot ek hi ummidavaar ko milenge, bhale hi voting mashin par koi bhi batan dabaai jaae
 People who have questioned evms say that after the election, evms should be randomly audited
 khaas taur par un vahaan, jahaan pratidwandiyon ke bich jeet kaa antar 15000 voton se zyada kaa rahaa he
 Obviously, before the elections in Bihar and Maharashtra, the Commission should answer these questions

 Parties may not have given tickets to half the population according to their proportions in this election, but here hundred percent women astrologers tried to explain the horoscope of the leaders and told who would be the king of UP
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii kundali, akhilesh yadav kii kundali, mayawati kii kundali, rahul gandhi kii kundali, inke grahon kii chaal kya kahati he, kiski kundali main rajyog he or kiski kundali main neech bhang raaj yoga he isaki gananaa kaashi jyotish vidhushi parishad ke binar tale baithi mahila jyotishiyon ne kii
 Because they say that the horoscope is like a person's mirror and every fluctuation of his life can be read by the movements of the planets
 jyotishacharya sonaali dikshit kahati hai ki piem modi, mayawati or akhilesh kaa janmang chakra dekhen to chunki mayawati or akhilesh donon kii buddha kii mahadasha chal rahi he
 In the Mahadasha of Buddha of Mayawati, there is a transit of Venus and it is also the Mahadasha of the Buddha of Akhilesh, if the position of Lagna is considered auspicious, then Akhilesh's party will come as the biggest party
 lekin ye sirf ek jyotishi kaa mat he
 Like other political parties of other astrologers gathered here, different opinions came out
 grahon kii chaal bhi koi parashar vidhi se kar rahaa tha to koi ank ganit se to koi samasaar shaastra se netaaon ke satta main pahunchane kii chaal ko naap rahaa tha
 Since the method was different, in this move of planets, Mayawati was seen ahead in some and Akhilesh in some, but most of all PM Modi was seen making his lead
 haryana se yahaan ai jyotishacharya anjali soni kahati hai ki modi ji kii kundali main lagn main mangal or chandramaa baithe hai jo balishtha yoga bana rahe hai isaliye modi ji kii hi sarkaar aegi
 The comments mahila jyotishiyon ne yahaan neton kii kundali ko panchang ke sahare apni apni vidhi se adhyan kiya
 However, to get the horoscope of the leaders, everyone took the support of Google only
 netaaon kii kundali kaa koun sa grah kiske bhav ko ooncha or nicha kar rahaa tha, kiski drushti vakri he or koun kiske liye maarak he
 After this calculation, even this panchayat of women astrologers could not reach any conclusion
 kaashi jyotish vidhushi parishad kii mahasachiv swati baranwaal ne bataaya ki sabhi mahila vidhushi yahaan ikattha hui thi
 Even though all astrology and seeing the movement of all the planets are telling the future, but like the leaders, they too do not have one
 or aisa isaliye bhi he kyonki chunaav main to asal jyotishi janata hoti he jo apane ballat kii chaal se netaaon kii taqadir badalati he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's horoscope, Akhilesh Yadav's horoscope, Mayawati's horoscope, Rahul Gandhi's horoscope, what does the planets of his planets say, whose horoscope has Raja Yoga and whose horoscope has low dissolved Raj Yog, calculated by the banner of Kashi Astrology Vidushi Parishad The women astrologers sitting under it did
 kyonki inkaa kahana he ki kundali vyakti ke aaine kii tarah hoti he or uske jivan ke har utaar chadhaav ko grahon kii chaal se padhaa ja saktaa he
 Jyotishacharya Sonali Dixit says that PM Modi, Mayawati and Akhilesh see the Janmak Chakra, since both Mayawati and Akhilesh are having Buddha's Mahadasha
 mayawati ke buddha kii mahadasha main shukr kii antardasha he or akhilesh ke buddha kii mahadasha he wo lagnesh bhi he, to lagn kii dasha shubh maani jaati he, lihaaja sabase badi party ke rup main akhilesh kii party aegi
 But this is only the opinion of an astrologer
 yahaan juty duusari jyotishiyon ke raajnneetik partiyon kii tarah alag-alag mat nikal kar saamne aaye
 Some were also doing the trick of the planets in the parashar method, while some were calculating the number of maths and some of the tricks of the leaders of the world from power
 chunki vidhi alag-alag thi lihaaja grahon kii is chaal main kisi main mayawati aage najar aa rahi thi to kisi main akhilesh, lekin zyaadaatar main piem modi hi apni badhat banaate najar aaye
 Jyotishacharya Anjali Soni, who came here from Haryana, says that Mars and Moon are sitting in the ascendant in Modi's horoscope who are making Balishta yoga, so only Modi government will come

 Swati Baranwal, general secretary of Kashi Jyotish Vidushi Parishad told that all the female students had gathered here
 bhale hi sabhi jyotish hon or sabhi grahon kii chaal dekh kar hi bhavishya bataa rahe hon par netaaon kii tarah inamen bhi eka nahin he

 haalia hui ek study main kaha gaya he ki edlt filmein dekhne vaale zyaadaatar purush dhokheybaaj hote hai
 They have a habit of cheating much more than others
 kya aapako bhi aisa lagata he?aaj ke samay main agar koi aapse koi ye kahe ki usne aaj tak edlt film nahin dekhi he to us par yakeen karnaa thodaa mushkil ho saktaa he
 The question immediately flashes in your mind that is it possible? Although this study only tells about men, but women are not behind in watching adult films
 30 se 35 varsh kii mahilaayein sabase adhik edlt filmein dekhati hai
 On the one hand, while there is a general perception about men that they definitely watch adult movies, women still hide this thing
 unka maananaa hota he ki agar unke partner ko ye pataa chal gaya to wo un par bharosa karnaa chhod degaa
 The same is true of men
 study ke mutabik edlt filmein dekhne vaale purushon main dhokhaa dene kii aadat prabal hoti he
 In another study related to this, it was said that fraudulent men watch adult movies two to three times a day
 angreji akhbaar times of india ke anusaar, uniwarsity of central florida ke e maraliya guin ke anusaar, edlt filmein purushon ko vikalp detii hai
 At that time he feels that he has options
 sexologist or kansaltent doctor dhananjay gambhire kaa kahana he kiporn dekhne se dekhne vaale main himmat aati he
 With this, he moves to cheat
 isaki vajah se unke vyavhaar main bhi kaaphi badlaav aa jate hai
 In such a situation, there may be a relation between watching adult movies and cheating but not directly
 iske peeche ek badi vajah ye bhi maani jaati he ki porn dekhne waalon ke liye antarang sambandh phantsi se adhik kuch nahin rah jaataa he
 In such a situation, they like to live in fantasy more than real life
 kaise kam karen edlt filmein dekhne kii lat ko?doctoron kaa kahana he ki ye koi beemaari nahin he lekin isaki lat buree he
 This can cause problems
 aise main khud ke liye kuch niyam banane kii jarurat he:-khud par kaabo
 Restrain yourself from watching adult movies
 -isse jude sabhi madhyamon ko hataa den
 -spend your free time in other tasks
 -agar aap apni aadat par kaabo nahin kar paa rahe hai to doctor kii salaah len

 You come to our home office remember to laugh along with a loud chant
 mujhe vishwaas he aap kuch bhi nahin bhuule honge

 togadiya ne likhaa ki vah or unke jaise tamaam kaaryakarta raamarajy kaa sapana sanjoe hue the, lekin 4 saal kii sarkaar ke baad ab vah sapana bikharata hua najar aa rahaa he
 There are many issues regarding Hindus looking at the path of promise fulfillment
 in muddon main sabase pehla mudda hyodhya main bhagwaan ram kaa bhavy mandirjo sansad main kanoon se ab band hi saktaa he
 Togadia said, the central government should withdraw the orders and advisory given to the states to take action against them by calling the gau rakshaks as goons
 patr main modi sarkaar ko kaaman civil code par apane vaayade ko puraa karne ko bhi kaha gaya he
 Talking about the situation of the farmers in the letter, Togadia wrote, "brother, you know very well i am from a poor peasant family of Saurashtra, Gujarat
 maine swayan mere haathon se kheti kii he
 i go to farming even today
 hamaare ghar main gaanv ke khet se laai hui sabji aapane khai he
 i have seen very closely how bad the situation of farmers in the village is today
 togadiya ne kaha, desh bhar ke hajaaron kisaanon se milakar unki baaten suni he
 That is why i want to communicate with you on the issues of farmers
 pradhanmantri ko likhe gaye patr main togadiya ne kaha, vikaas ke liye hinduon ko apamaanit karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 Both can go together

 Praveen Togadia said, 4 years have passed since the government has taken a U-turn on all its promises, but there is still time and by sitting together and discussing we can all take the country forward on the path of Hindutva and development

 Instructed the students not to share personal information anywhere by mistake
 amit pathak ne apane vidhyaarthee jivan ke kuch pahaluon ko saamne rakhte hue bataaya ki har insaan main koi na koi khubi jarur hoti he
 He needs to be recognized

 Your own dreams will also come true
 vidhyaarthiyon ko sabase pehle anushaasan main rahanaa siikhnaa hoga
 Addressing students, he said that never share your personal content on whatsapp and Facebook in life
 anjaan insaan ko apni detail bhi kabhi na bataaen
 Also take care in making video calls and keep your location secret

 gujarat main chunaav prachaar mangalvaar ko khatm ho gaya
 Earlier, the BJP and Congress dumped their full force
 gujarat main rahul gandhi ne pehali baar press conference karke tamaam sawaal uthaae or pradhanmantri narendra modi ko gherne kii koshish kii
 At the same time, many BJP ministers responded one after the other to Rahul Gandhi's allegations
 rahul gandhi ne gujarat main apane chunaav prachaar ke dauraan press conference main aarope lagaaya tha ki narendramodibhrashtachar ke maamle par chup ho gaye hai
 From the son of Amit Shah to the Rafale deal, they are not responding to the allegations

 Rahul Gandhi need not worry about that
 unhone kaha ki ek-ek sawaal kaa jawaab gujarat kii janata ko de diya gaya he
 Raising the question of Nano factory in Gujarat, Rahul Gandhi also said that land for Nano factory was given almost free of cost, but Gujarat did not benefit from it
 unhone modi ke si plane main landing par bhi sawaal uthaaya or kaha ki yah dhyaan bhatakaane kii koshish he
 Responding to this, Naqvi said that when the election campaign started in Gujarat, Rahul Gandhi was saying that development has gone mad
 ab vikaas dikh rahaa he to vikaas kaa majaak udaane vaale baichaiyn ho rahe hai
 Now the people will respond selectively to these people
 mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne rahul gandhi ke congress party ke adhyaksh chune jane ke bare main kataaksh karte hue kaha ki rahul gandhi ab apni party ke president ho gaye hai
 He has got promotion with out performance
 isliye vah dabl badhai ke paatr hai

 Now in opposition, he is throwing a no ball
 unhen meri salaah he ki pich kaa mood dekh kar khelen
 The way the BJP attacked Manmohan Singh's dinner with the former Foreign Minister of Pakistan
 apni press conference main rahul gandhi ne is baat ko bhi uthaaya

 lekin jis tarah se puri congress or pakistan kaa puraa kunba bachaav main utar aayaa he, usase saaf he ki daal main kaala nahin he, puri kii puri daal kaali he
 Along with this, Naqvi also added that before raising the question of Pakistan, he should also keep in mind that the Modi government had given a befitting reply to the terrorists by entering Pakistan
 aaj pakistan kii duniya main koi nahin sun rahaa he
 The whole world is influenced by Modi's policies
 arab desh se lekar america tak koi pakistan kii nahin sun rahaa he
 When Manmohan Singh was in government, even small countries showed eyes to India

 aapako bataa den ki yah joda bachche ke sarnem ko lekar apane bich ho rahe jhagade ko sulajhane ke liye court kii sharan main pahunchaa tha
 But instead the judge ordered him to change the first name of the child
 kyonki jaj ke mutabik sirf ek shaks kaa naam hi maseehaa ho saktaa he or vah or koi nahin balki jijas christ hai
 The case is from the US state of Tennessee
 khabar ke mutabik, bachche kii maa jelesa martin or uske pita bachche ke sarnem par sahamat nahin ho paa rahe the
 Both wanted to put their surname in front of the child's name
 is jhagade ko sulajhane ke liye donon guuruuvaar ko jaj lu an belue kii adaalat main pahunche
 However, Belu did not object to the child's surname, but to his name Messiah
 bachche kaa puraa naam maseehaa deshaun martin tha, lekin belue ne bachche ke mata-pita se kaha ki ve maseehaa naam bhul jaaen or bachche kaa naam badalakar martin deshaun mekaklog rakh den
 In this way, the surname of both the parents of the child will come in this name
 jaj belue ke mutabik, 'maseehaa shabd keval shabd nahin balki yah ek oopaadhi he, jo keval ek shaks ke naam he or vah he jijas christ
 'when the judge was asked what he had to say about the children whose name is Jesus, he said,' i thought about this too, but it is not relevant in this case
 'bachche kii maa martin jaj ke is faisle se hairaan hai or unka kahana he ki unhone kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki unke apane dharm kii vajah se unhen apane bachche kaa naam badalane ke liye majaboor hona padegaa
 He said, 'I am shocked
 maine apane bachche kaa naam yah sochakar maseehaa nahin rakhaa tha kyonki yah bhagwaan kaa naam he
 i do not think a judge can force me to change my child's name due to his religious beliefs

 ' sab unhen twitor ministar kah kar pukaarte hai or vaaki unhone south block or videsh niti ko twitor par laa diya he
 Since the gentle, cultured Shashi Tharoor has started using his Oxford accent and Blackberry fiercely at the Ministry of External Affairs, he has led to controversy one after another
 yahaan tak ki ab do sabhyataaon kii takaraahat main talavaarein bhi khinchati dikh rahi hai
 One is that of old ideas, bound by tradition and rules and diplomatic etiquette; The second is the non-acceptance of sanctions, the habitual use of the more liberal bureaucracy of the United Nations and the fondness to roam the high literary ranks
 unki taaja chook-yadi ise is shrenee main rakhaa ja saktaa he to-jawaharlal nehru kii videsh niti par kii gai aalochanatmak tippaniyan hai, jinhone kabhi na khatm hone vaale tharur aakhyaan ko phir shuru kar diya or desh ke videsh niti pratishthan tathaa kutanyik goshtiyon ko hathiyaar uplabdh kara diya, jahaan videsh rajyamantri kii har harakat or har twitor ko katili najaron se dekha jaataa he, har baar unke rajnatik kariyar kaa marsia likh diya jaataa he
 This time Tharoor became aggressive and he lambasted the media for misrepresenting him that the controversy is not giving up on him due to so much audacity and hurting the sentiments of many people
 ek vajah to yah he ki pehali baar saansad banane ke baavjood unhen rajyamantri ke pad par bitha diya gaya
 The second reason is undoubtedly his exotic accent and five star lifestyle

 Foreign policy is also a complex and responsible task, which cannot be prepared like this (on Twitter)
 ''tharur ko mantri kii kursi par baithe chah maheene ho gaye hai
 In this period he has made less friends, more enemies
 ab to tharur par hamale ke liye phir qamar kasi ja rahi he, unke khilaaf nae aarope taiyaar kiye ja rahe hai
 One of them is the money spent by the Ministry of External Affairs to buy books written by him, including the book in which the Gandhi family has been slightly criticized
 haj kota ke aavanton se sambandhit shikaayatein bhi hai jinaki vajah se hi unase yah jimmedaari chin lee gai
 Being the state minister, Tharoor is a stronghold of the Gulf, Latin America and African countries
 pehle haj kota aisa hi prabhaar sanbhaalane vaale mantri sambhalate aae the
 "the responsibilities were not allocated afresh," Tharoor believes
 videsh mantri hi puure mantralay kaa hsabhaari hota he, or har maamle kii filein unke daftar se hi hokar jaati hai
 So in the case of Haj too, he made all the decisions, but when we were both in Delhi, adequate consultation was done
 '' lekin krishna ise duusari tarah dekhte hai, ''siton ke aavanton ke tareeke ko lekar ba't sari shikaayatein hamen mili thim

 Tharoor's alleged list of ministerial status includes a growing list of controversies
 kaha ja rahaa he ki apni pustak indiyah from midnite tu da milinium ko ve videsh ke bhartiya duutavaason main pramot kar rahe hai
 His critics point out that there was criticism of the nehru-gandhi family and that the Ministry should not promote such books, Tharoor denies the allegations, he has a reputation, "on what basis are these allegations made?" The book was published in 1949 and some copies were purchased only then
 
 
 mere sarkaar kaa hissaa banane se bahut pehle
 "but the documents available with India Today from the Ministry of External Affairs show that Tharoor's three books, including India from Midnight to Millennium, were purchased by the Foreign Office after he became the Minister of State for External Affairs

 Though Tharoor may be technically correct that he was not involved in the selection response, the etiquette suggested that he should have advised his ministry not to buy his books so that it would not be considered an abuse of office
 iske alaava adhiktar vivaad shaileyon ke takaraav se bhi sambandhit he
 In South Block, if junior ministers have to keep their chair, then they have to keep their mouth shut, but Tharoor is made of clay, and the other is from a cultural background, and this is the root of the problem

 One of the consequences of Tharoor being engulfed in controversies is that under him, attention is being diverted from important issues such as solid policy interventions about Africa, Latin America and the Gulf countries

 The report of Justices Ranjit Singh Ayog, made to investigate the violence in Punjab after the Guru Granth Sahib's disgrace cases, overturned the important witness statement of the case even before it was tabled in the Assembly
 mukhya gavaah himmat singh ne ayog ke chairman or jail mantri sukhjinder singh randhaava ke dabaav main bayaan dene kaa aarope lagaaya he

 In an editorial in Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'saamana', Shiv Sena has praised the Fadnavis government for loan waiver of farmers
 saamana main likhaa gaya he ki rajya sarkaar ne jis tarah vipaksh ke sabhi netaaon or duusare pakshon se baatcheet kar kisaan karj maafee kaa rasta nikaala wo tarif ke kaabil he
 The farmer will always be indebted to the government

 Apart from this, Shiv Sena also attacked the congress-ncp in an editorial for taking credit for loan waiver of farmers
 sampadakeey main shivasena ne kaha kii maharashtra kekisaanon kii karj muktiki maang kaa shivasena ne samarthan kiya or karj mukti dilaane kaa vachan diya, jise puraa karne ke liye shivasena ne apni sarkaar se hi jhagada kiya lekin shivasena ne apana puraa kiya
 The loan waiver will benefit 90 lakh farmers of the state while 40 lakh farmers will be deprived of this loan waiver
 aise kisaanon ko bhi shivasena sarkaar par dabaav daalkar nyaay dilaaegi
 In the editorial, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray pledged to do what the government will do to take back the cases registered on farmers during the farmers' agitation in Maharashtra
 sampadakeey menmukhyamantri fadanvis kii kisaanon kii karjamafise sarkaar par 35 hajaar karod rupee ke boj ko lekar chintaa par fatkaar lagaayee
 Shiv Sena said that this loan waiver is nothing to prevent farmers' suicide in the state
 sampadakeey main shivasena ne kaha rajya chalane ke liye paison se zyada janata kii jaan kaa zyada mol he
 Will the government rule the dead if the number of people dying everyday increases? Uddhav in the editorial advised the Chief Minister to cancel large projects and seek cooperation from mlas, mps, current and former ministers, metropolitan members to reduce the burden of debt waiver of farmers
 sampadakeey main uddhav ne kisaanon kii karj maafee par sawaal uthaane or ise fishan kaa naam dene waalon ko jawaab dete hue kaha ki shivasena ke liye yah ladaai kisaanon or unke bacchon ke bhavishya or unki jindagi-maut kii thi

 dakshin gujarat or mumbai main in dinon red sand boa kii taskari dhadlle se ho rahi he
 In common parlance, it is also called a double snake
 haal hi main navi mumbai police ne teen logon ko giraftaar kar chaar red sand boa baraamad kiya, jinaki bazaar main keemat paanch karod rupee se bhi zyada he
 The police had received intelligence that some people were coming to deal with the boa, laid a trap and found three red sand boas near Kharghar after searching the three suspects for their bags for questioning
 krime branch ke inspector sunil bajaare ke mutabik khaarghar main little mal ke nikat teen log ek agent se milakar in sanpon kaa sauda karne vaale the, lekin unhen range haathon pakad liya gaya
 Four double snakes, medicine and several syringes were found from his bag
 in sanpon ko injection dene ke baad unka vajan bad jaataa he, jisase unka daam tay hota he
 The names of the arrested accused are Feroz Rasool Khan, Rohit Om Prakash Mishra and Anil Kishore Jadhav
 police ke mutabik aisi ashanka he ki in logon ke taar kisi internation racket se jude hon
 Investigation is going on in this regard
 jaankaar bataate hai ki boa kaa baseraa sabase sabase zyada gujarat main he
 They are found in Surat, Tapi, Valsad and Vapi in Gujarat besides Dadar and Nagar Haveli
 iske alaava matamaile rangon vaala is saanp kaa maharashtra, andhra pradesh kii seemaa, tamilnadu or uttar-purvi ilaakon ke maidani or daldali bhaagon main bhi baseraa he
 It is said that the thicker the boa, the higher its price
 police ke mutabik behad durlabh ho chuke ye saanp taskaron kii duniya main vajan ke hisaab se bikne lage hai or bakaayaada inkaa rate cord bhi he
 250 gram of boa is sold for Rs 2-5 lakh, while 500 gram of boo is sold for 8-10 lakh rupees
 ek kilo ke boa kii keemat ek karod rupee tak ho sakati he, jabaki do kilo kaa boa 3-5 karod rupee main bikta he
 Perhaps this is the reason why the weight of these idiots is increased by injecting them in the circle of the rate cord
 darasal boa ke taskar isse judi manyataon ko bhi bhunaate hai
 If a boa is seen around the house, it is considered auspicious sign in many areas of the country
 dakshin ke kai rajyon main ise matake main rakhaa jaataa he or mana jaataa he ki isse dhan kii prapti hoti he
 Recognition is related to the progress of the house, so people are not afraid to raise it because it is not poisonous
 itnaa hi nahin agar ise paala, to aamadani kaa ek or jariya bhi khulata he
 People also rent it for the puja and get the money by the hour
 udhar, aise maamle bhi kam nahin, jab is domunhe kii aahuti di jaati he or ye manyata judi he kaala jaadu se
 According to one information, in South Asian countries, it is also used to make tablets of strength
 kuch nai dawaaon ke research main bhi ise aajamaaya ja rahaa he
 According to Lt
 Col
 Jesse Khanna, member of the Animal Welfare Board of India, red sand boa is being used to make many medicines
 china, taiwan, malaysia jaise deshon main inaki maang bahut bad gai he
 Boa is neither poisonous nor angry
 lagbhag ek meter se zyada lambey is saanp kii ausat umr 15−20 saal tak hoti he
 The specialty of a boa is its tail, which looks like a mouth, so it is also called a double-faced snake
 dakshin asia ke kai deshon main in sanpon ko paala bhi jaataa he, lekin dawaaon or research main inaki jarurat ko dekhte hue badi taadaad main inkaa shikaar bhi ho rahaa he
 For this two mouths, this unruffled person is given a lot of trouble and his tail is burnt and wax is filled in it and he is given the appearance of eyes, so that the boa can be described as a bifurcation
 shikariyon ne laalach kii intehaa main boa ko vilupt prajatiyon kii catagori main khadaa kar diya he

 pakistani media ne videsh vibhaag ke hawaale se rapat main kaha he ki ahaluwalia ko ek virodh patr bhi saunpa gaya he
 Prior to this, a special meeting of the National Security Committee of Pakistan NSC chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan took place, in which it was decided to raise the matter in all international forums
 pakistan ne sweekaar kiya he ki bhartiya vayusena ke vimaanon ne balakot main hamale kiye, lekin usne kaha ki jab uske yudhak vimaanon ne javaabi karrwai kii to bhartiya vimaan waapas laut gaye or is hamale main jameen par koi nuksaan nahin hua he
 However, within a few hours of the attack, Pakistan threatened to retaliate

 bihar main sharabbandi ke mudde par rajya kii police or utpaada vibhaag main sab kuch saamaanya nahin he
 In one case, the state police questioned the officers and employees of the excise department for 10 hours at the police station to pressurize them on the basis of which source
 yahi nahin, is maamle main ab utpaada nireekshak deepak kumaar ko giraftaar kar liya gaya he
 Also, Suvendra Kumar of Lohra has also been arrested

 But in this case, instead of sending the accused to jail, the police kept trying to create pressure by questioning the officers of the excise department at the police station
 lekin maamle ne us samay tool pakad liya jab nalanda ke zila adhikari sen ke gaanv espi ke saath pahunch gaye or yahaan tak kah daalaa ki sen ko fansaaya gaya he
 But in this case, when the senior officials of the excise department warned the police that if there was pressure on their department officials to save Sen, they would not conduct raids in future, then Sen was sent to jail
 haalanki utpaada nireekshak kii giraftaar ke baad ab ye maamla kitna garmayega, yah jaanane ke liye philhal intjaar karnaa hoga
 The comments shanivaar ko bihar ke purv up mukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne nalanda ke dm or espi ke khilaaf morcha khol diya

 The issue relates to Nalanda, the home district of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, where 167 liquor bottles were recovered from the house of one of his party's block president Chandrajit Kumar Sen on 30 August
 lekin is maamle main police aropiyon ko jail bhejne kii jagah utpaada vibhaag ke adhikariyon se hi thane main poochtacha kar dabaab banane kii koshish karti rahi
 But the case caught up when Nalanda district officials reached Sen's village SP and even said that Sen had been implicated
 lekin is maamle main jab utpaada vibhaag ke variya adhikariyon ne police ko chetavanee di ki agar sen ko bachaane ke liye unke vibhaag ke adhikariyon ke upar dabaav banaaya gaya to wo bhavishya main chhapemari nahin karenge, tab jaakar sen ko jail bheja gaya
