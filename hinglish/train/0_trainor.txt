 It is necessary to find out which party had appealed for the Bharat Bandh, because even all the opposition parties do not know the answer
 ravivaar se somvaar tak wo yahi safai dete rahe hai ki unhone bharat band kii apil nahin kii he
 At a rally in Uttar Pradesh's Kushinagar on Sunday, Prime Minister Modi said that on the one hand the government is engaged in closing all the routes of corruption, on the other hand it is trying to close all the ways of black money, on the other hand people want to stop India
 aap mujhe bataaiye bhrashtachar kaa rasta band hona chahie ki bharat band hona chahie
 After this statement of the Prime Minister, the opposition started asking for proof that who has appealed for the Bharat Bandh
 kya media or soshal media ne apni taraf se 28 november ke alag-alag virodh kaaryakramon ko bharat band kaha
 This is not difficult for BJP to prove
 bijepi 24 november ke tamaam press conference or press relies kaa baarik adhyayan kar sakati he jab 28 november ke kaarykram kaa elaan hua tha
 We have seen many parties, cannot claim them but as much as we have seen, there is no mention of Bharat Bandh in any of them
 24 november ko congress netaa randeep surajevaala ne kaha tha ki congress desh bhar main jan aakrosh diwas manaayegi
 Sitaram Yechury's statement on the 24th itself is that on 28 November, many parties will celebrate the Day of Anger across the country
 24 november ko hi sipiai netaa di raja ne kaha tha ki left dal 24 november se 30 november ke bich haftaa bhar pradarshan karenge
 CPM has a press release on its website which is released on 23 November
 isamen saaf kaha gaya he ki 6 left dalon ne tay kiya he ki ek saptaah kaa virodh pradarshan hoga
 India is not a closed word in the press release
 27 november ko pradhanmantri ke bayaan ke baad usee din dilli main jairam ramesh ne press conference kar saaf kar diya ki congress ne bharat band kaa aahvaan nahin kiya he
 On Sunday itself, the Aam Aadmi Party also made it clear that there was no appeal for Bharat Bandh on their behalf
 vaise tripura or kerala main sipiem ne band kiya
 In Kolkata, CPM leader and politburo member Viman Bose has criticized the bandh and said that the Left has made a mistake by invoking the bandh
 band or bharat band main antar hota he
 The question is who appealed for the shutdown of India
 basapa netaa mayawati ne bhi somvaar ko bayaan diya ki basapa ne bharat band kii apil nahin kii
 Samajwadi Party MP Naresh Agarwal said that i think this is a successful shutdown till now, because India is closed since the day of demonetisation
 ham koi nayaa band nahin bula rahe hai
 Ghulam Nabi Azad also said in the Rajya Sabha that the Prime Minister had made a misrepresentation
 loksabhaa main congress netaa mallikarjun khadge ne pradhanmantri se galatabayani ke liye maafee kii maang kii he
 The BSP, SP, AAP, Trinamool, Congress and six Left parties i
e
 11 opposition parties kept saying that we did not appeal for the Bharat Bandh, then from where did the Prime Minister talk of Bharat Bandh
 vipaksh ko piem se jawaab to nahin mila lekin piem ke bharat band kehane se vipaksh din bhar safai dene main laga rahaa
 BJP also understood that the best word to shut down the opposition is India
 baharhaal somvaar ko kai jagahon par dharna pradarshan hua
 Only the workers of the parties appeared on the streets regarding demonetisation
 aam log samarthan main nahin utre
 In many places trade boards have also put up their posters that they do not support the Bharat Bandh
 whatsap par shanivaar se hi abhiyaan sa chal rahaa tha ki ham bharat band kaa samarthan nahin karte hai
 So, was the slogan of Bharat Bandh spread through whatsapp and whose support and opposition started talking
 samachar padhane kaa yaa pataa karne kaa vakt nahin he to koi baat nahin, whatsap kii saamagree ko hi khabar maanane kii galati na karen
 People of every party are misleading through this
 baharhaal is bich notebandi ke dauraan itane niyamon kii ghoshnaa hui he ki sabakaa hisaab rakhana mushkil he
 It was discussed earlier that people who deposit more than 2
5 lakhs in their account will be fined 200%
 10 november ko kendriya rajasav sachiv doctor hasmukh adhiya se sawaal poocha gaya ki maan lijie vibhaag ko ye pataa chalata he ki kisi khate main das lakh se zyaada kii rakam jamaa kii gai he or rakam jamakarta kii ghoshit aay se mail nahin kha rahi he
 In this case, how much tax and penalty will be imposed on the depositor
 to adhiya sahab kaa jawaab he ki is tarah ke maamalon ko kar chori mana jayega
 As per section 270 (a) of the Income Tax Act, the amount of tax will be recovered and 200 percent amount will be recovered as penalty in addition to the tax paid
 patr soochna karyaalay kii website par ye press release maujuud he
 At the rally in Ghazipur, the Prime Minister made it clear that excluding notes in the Ganges does not wash away sins
 in bayanon se yahi lag rahaa tha ki jo log 30 disambar ke baad apni aamadani kaa hisaab nahin de paayenge unki kair nahin he
 Action will be taken against them
 28 november ko vitt mantri arun jetali ne loksabhaa main iskar sanshodhan bill pesh kiya
 According to this, those who claim themselves to be black have got another opportunity to turn white
 ek karod blike mani par 30 fisadi yani tees lakh rupee tex dene honge
 Ten percent will be fined one million
 33 fisadi sarcharge jo tex par lagata he,yani 9
 90 lakh rupees
 yani ek karod main se 49
 90 lakh rupees tax will be deducted
 ab bachaa 50 lakh to uskaa 25 lakh turant mil jayega
 25 lakh rupees will be deposited in the Prime Minister's Poor Welfare Deposit Scheme
 chaar saal tak bina byaaj ke paisa sarkaar ke paas rahegaa
 After that, 25 lakh people will get black money
 yani ek karod kaala dhan he to usamen se pachaas lakh abhi bhi batch saktaa he
 Not only this, those who did not declare their income and were caught in the raid, if they could not account, then they would be taxed 60 percent
 25 fisadi sarcharge or 10 fisadi jurmaana lagegaa
 85 rupees for 100 rupees will be taxed
 khud bataa denge to 100 main 50 rupaya aapkaa rahegaa
 If you do not tell, you will get 15 rupees in 100
 yani donon hi surat main aap blike mani kaa pachaas fisadi white ho saktaa he
 When the government had started a plan to declare undisclosed income between June 1 and September 30 and called it a final plan, then what should be considered in this situation
 kya sarkaar kaale dhan vaale ko ek or mauka de rahi he?tippaniyan Regarding the plan from June to September, the government had made it clear that the Income Tax Department would not investigate where the money came from
 lekin unhen 45 percent tex or penlti dene honge
 In the June 2016 ‘mann Ki Baat’, the Prime Minister said, “for those who have undisclosed income, the Government of India has given an opportunity
 jurmaana dekar ham anek prakaar ke boj se mukt ho sakate hai
 i have promised that if voluntary who gives information to the government regarding undisclosed income, then the government will not do any kind of investigation
 saath hi main deshavaasiyon se yah bhi kahana chahta hum ki 30 sitambar tak kii ye yojana he
 Take this as one last chance
 30 sitambar ke pehle aap is vyavastha kaa laabh uthaaen or 30 sitambar ke baad sambhavit takalifon se apane aap ko bachaa len
 " nae sanshodhan par ham baat karenge
 Some provisions are also old, some have been added
 sarkaar ko yah sanshodhan kyon karnaa padaa, jab usne 1 june se 30 sitambar kii karrwai ko aakhri mauka kaha
 Whether the undisclosed income received during or after demonetisation should not be forfeited
 kahin ye ek or mauka to nahin he
 When demonetisation is going on, what is the meaning of this amendment, we have to understand whether gold, property and shares also come in this amendment or we are understanding it only in the context of cash notes
 pradhanmantri ke is bayaan ke baad vipaksh saboot maangane laga ki kisne bharat band kii apil kii he
 Did the media and social media on its part call separate protest programs of November 28 as Bharat Bandh? bijepi ke liye bhi sabit karnaa koi mushkil nahin he
 The BJP can closely study all the press conferences and press releases of 24 November when the 28 November program was announced
 hamane kai dalon kaa dekha he, daawa to nahin kar sakate lekin jitna dekha usamen kisi main bharat band kaa zikr nahin he
 On November 24, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala had said that the Congress would celebrate the public outrage across the country
 24 ko hi seetaram yechuri kaa bayaan he ki 28 november ko kai dal desh bhar main aakrosh diwas manaayenge
 On 24 November, CPI leader d Raja had said that the Left parties would hold a week-long protest from 24 November to 30 November
 sipiem kii website par ek press release he jo 23 november ko jari hui he
 It clearly states that the 6 Left parties have decided that a week of protests will take place
 press release main bharat band shabd hi nahin he
 After the Prime Minister's statement on 27 November, Jairam Ramesh made it clear in Delhi on the same day that the Congress has not called for a Bharat Bandh
 ravivaar ko hi aam aadmi party ne bhi saaf kar diya ki unki taraf se bharat band kii apil nahin hui he
 However, CPM shut down in Tripura and Kerala
 kolkata main sipiem netaa or paulitte beuro sadsy vimaan bose ne is band kii aalochana kar di he or kaha he ki band kaa aahvaan kar left ne galati kii he
 There is a difference between Bandh and Bharat Bandh
 sawaal he bharat band kii apil kisne kii
 BSP leader Mayawati also made a statement on Monday that the BSP did not appeal for the Bharat Bandh
 samaajawaadee party ke saansad naresh agarwal ne kaha ki mere khyaal se ye ab tak kaa safal band he, kyonki bharat to notebandi ke din se hi band he
 We are not calling any new bandh
 rajya sabha main gulam nabi azaad ne bhi kaha ki pradhanmantri ne galat bayani kii he
 In the Lok Sabha, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge has demanded an apology from the Prime Minister for wrongdoing
 basapa, sapa, aap, trinmul, congress or chah vam dal yani 11 vipakshi dal yahi kehete rahe ki hamane bharat band kii apil hi nahin kii thi to phir pradhanmantri ne bharat band kii baat kahaan se kar di
 The opposition did not get a reply from the PM, but due to the pm's saying Bharat Bandh, the opposition was busy in cleaning the whole day
 bijepi bhi samaj gai ki vipaksh ko band karne kaa sabase acha shabd bharat band he
 However, there was a sit-in demonstration at several places on Monday
 notebandi ko lekar dalon ke kaaryakarta hi sadakon par nazar aae
 Common people did not come in support
 kai jagahon par vyapaar mandalon ne apana poster bhi laga diya ke ve bharat band kaa samarthan nahin karte hai
 whatsapp has been running since Saturday that we do not support the Bharat Bandh
 to kya bharat band kaa naaraa whatsap ke zariye failaayaa gaya or jiske samarthan or virodh kii baaten hone lageen
 If there is no time to read or know the news, then do not make the mistake of accepting the content of whatsapp as news
 har dal ke log iske zariye kuprachaar kar rahe hai
 However, during the note ban, so many rules have been announced that it is difficult to keep track of all
 pehle charchaa hui ki jo log apane khate main dhai lakh se zyada paisa jamaa karenge to 200 percent jurmaana lagegaa
 On November 10, Union Revenue Secretary Dr
 Hasmukh Adhia was asked the question that suppose the department finds that more than one million has been deposited in an account and the amount does not match the declared income of the depositor
 aise main jamakarta par kitna kar or jurmaana lagaaya jayega
 So Adhia Sahib's answer is that such cases would be considered tax evasion
 iskar adhinium kii dhara 270(e) ke hisaab se kar kii raashi vasuuli jaaegi or bhugtey kar ke alaava 200 pratishat kii raashi jurmaana ke rup main vasuuli jaaegi
 This press release is available on the website of the Press Information Bureau
 gajipur kii raily main pradhanmantri ne saaf kar diya tha ki ganga main note bahaane se paap nahin dhul jate hai
 It seemed from these statements that those who will not be able to report their income after December 30 are not in good shape
 unke khilaaf karrwai hogi
 On November 28, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley introduced the Income Tax Amendment Bill in the Lok Sabha
 iske anusaar khud aage aakar apana kaala dhan bataane waalon ko safed karne kaa ek or mauka mila he
 One crore black money will have to pay 30 per cent, ie 30 lakh rupees tax
 das fisadi yani das lakh jurmaana lagegaa
 33% surcharge levied on tax, ie 9
 90 lakh rupee
 That is 49 out of a crore
 90 lakh rupee tex ke cat jaayenge
 Now 50 lakhs left, then 25 lakhs will be found immediately
 25 lakh rupee pradhanmantri garib kalyaan deposit skim main jamaa hoga
 The money will remain with the government for four years without interest
 uske baad 25 lakh kaale dhan vaale ko mil jayega
 That is, if there is one crore black money, then fifty lakh can still be saved from it
 yahi nahin jin logon ne apni aay ghoshit nahin kii or chaape main pakade gaye, hisaab nahin de paae to un par 60 fisadi tex lagegaa
 There will be 25 percent surcharge and 10 percent penalty
 100 rupee main 85 rupaya tex main chalaa jayega
 If you tell yourself, 50 rupees in 100 will be yours
 nahin bataayenge to 100 main 15 rupaya hi aapako milegaa
 That is, in both cases, you can be fifty percent white of black money
 jab sarkaar ne 1 june se 30 sitambar ke bich aghoshit aay ghoshit karne kii ek yojana chalaai hi thi or use antim yojana kaha tha to aisi sthiti main is nae sanshodhan ko kya samajha jaae
 Is Government Giving Black Money Another Chance? Comments june se sitambar kii yojana ko lekar sarkaar ne saaf kar diya tha ki iskar vibhaag is baat kii koi padtaal nahin karegaa ki paisa kahaan se aayaa he
 But they have to pay 45% tax and penalty
 june 2016 ke 'man kii baat' main pradhanmantri ne yah baat kahi thi, "jin logon ke paas aghoshit aay he, unke liye bharat sarkaar ne ek mauka diya he
 We can be free from many types of burden by paying a fine

 vasai ke kile kaa aitihaasik mahatv he

 Apart from this, vegetables and crops were also grown in this fort
 vasai tab mahatvapurn ho gaya jab sopaara ke puraane sopaara bandargah (vasai se 10 kilometre dur aaj kaa nalasopara gaanv) prayog karne ke liye surakshit nahin rahaa
 Despite this, it remained a center of trade for the people of Vasai

 The Portuguese built strong walls and a main gate from all four sides

 Vasai remained a symbol of prosperity for about 150 years thereafter
 is dauraan portugaliyon ne yahaan mahatvapurn ghar, math, carch or anathalay banaae
 Only Portuguese nobles were allowed inside the fort
 portugaliyon ke adheen vasai nausena ke pramukh centre or jahaaj nirmaan kaa pramukh centre bhi tha
 In 1739, the brother of Maratha ruler Peshwa Bajirao, Cheemaji Appa conquered the fort
 haalanki isamen unhen bahut se logon ko khona padaa
 It was in 1802 when Peshwa Bajirao II signed the treaty of Vasai
 iske baad vasai kaa kila or shahar puri tarah angrejon ke prabhutv main aa gaya
 Today, the beauty of the fort is only slightly during Diwali when foreign and other tourists arrive here
 yahi wo samay he jab kile kii safai karai jaati he
 But today most of the structures inside this old fort are in ruins and are waiting for renovation

 Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj spoke about this noise
 bahut dukh ke saath kahana pad rahaa he ki ab giriraaj singh, shahanwaaz hossain, yogi adityanath or muqataar abbaas naqvi ke haathon kai log pakistan jane se vanchit ho jaaenge
 These people did not have a travel agency, but while challenging the opponents from time to time, they definitely said that they will send or go to Pakistan
 inke dwaara pakistan bheje jane kii kaamana karne vaale logon ko ab apane paise se janaa padegaa
 i had high hopes from these leaders coming in prime time that at some point, Shahnawaz bhai or Giriraj ji will send me to Pakistan
 bihar se hone ke baad bhi inhone meraa khyaal nahin rakhaa
 Now that Pakistan and Hindustan are going to be brothers, they may not even be needed
 sangh ke bayaan ke baad bhartiya raajnneeti ke in pakistan bhejk netaaon ko pakistan bhejne kii travel agency band kar bihar chunaav main ji jaan se jute janaa chahie
 Pakistan is the largest chapter of the tithe ie Sathe Satyam in Indian politics
 pakistan ko sabak sikhaana he, ise hamaare netaaon or unke kuch agyani samarthak ratate rahete hai
 As soon as elections are over, they start to get louder
 pakistan kaa naam lekar kai netaaon main videsh mantri kii si kshamta kaa vikaas hone lagata he
 Pakistan is a problem in Indian politics that is resolved in two minutes with statements
 in dinon gaddaar lafz se bor ho chuke netaaon ne pakistan bhejne kaa prayog shuru kar diya he
 There were so many statements of sending there that Pakistan must have been terrified
 is ghabrahat main wo bhi seemaa se is paar logon ko dhadadhad bhejne laga
 These leaders only considered their opponents eligible to go to Pakistan
 sangh ke bayaan se ab bijepi ke samarthakon ko bhi pakistan jane main koi naitik sankat nahin hoga
 Seriously, this thinking was preventing the government from doing anything new
 pradhanmantri jab bhi kadam badhaate hai sab pakistan ko sabak sikhaane vaala chapter kholkar ratna chaalu kar dete hai
 The domestic industry of hostility is going to be good days in Pakistan
 pakistan ko lekar saare kanfuzan dur hue
 Sometimes neighbors, sometimes enemies and sometimes in the morning, people even start the process of going to a certain destination to go to Pakistan
 ab aise log kaan kholkar sun len
 The order has come from the biggest school to teach Pakistan that we are all brothers
 sangh or sarkaar ke bich chali teen dinon kii safal samanvay baithak ke baad aresas ke sah sar kaarywah dattatreya hasbhole ne kaha he ki bharat ke padosi deshon ke saath paariwarik or saanskrithik sambandh bhi hai
 Be it Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Pakistan or Bangladesh
 balki apane sharir se hi tuutakar wo bane hue hai do desh to
 
 pakistan or bangladesh
 So it is natural that the people living here belong to their own family
 kabhi-kabhi sambandhon main
 
 jaise bhai bhaiyon main bhi ho jaataa he
 This must have happened in a few decades
 lekin in sab ko bhuulakar ham padosi deshon ke saath saanskrithik sambandh
 
 apane itihaas ke saath
 
 bhugol ke saath jo jude hue hai
 
 wo or achche kaise ho sakate hai, is drushti se bhi thodaa padosi desh ke bare main vichaar kiya
 Journalist Smita Mishra also asked that there has been a rapid increase in the past few times from Pakistan, do you think it is possible for India to establish a brother-brother relationship
 to dattatreya hasbhole ne kaha ki bharat main kaurav or pandav bhi bhai bhai the
 Everything has to be done to establish a religion
 dharm sthapana ke liye sab karnaa padataa he
 But for the establishment of religion, there was a war between the Kaurava Pandavas
 kya hasbhole ji ne yah kah diya ki dharm ko lekar jo kaurav pandavon ke bich hua vaisaa kuch hone vaala he yaa ve ye kah rahe hai ki dharm yuddh se pehle kii tarah 105 bhai ek ho sakate hai
 Hearing this statement, i was a bit worried by Hurrian leader Gilani ji
 agar un par is bayaan kaa sakaaratmak asar ho gaya to kya pataa ve phir se suutakes lekar dilli ke chanakyapuri sthit pakistan duutavas aa jaye, udhar se sartaaj azeez sahab bhi aa jaaen
 Can these meetings now take place under the principle of Bhai Bhai? inhen mulakaaton ke chalate to wo baat na ho saki jiskaa vaada upha main pradhanmantri kar aae the
 Will Ufa's color bring color now? kya kuch nayaa or pehle se bada karne ke liye kuch nayaa alag maahaul banaaya ja rahaa he
 After all, why does the RSS feel that there was a fight between Bhai Bhai, civil court, there was no fight over terrorism, Tada court one
 kya sangh ab aatankwaad kii shart se nikal kar samskruti or sambandhon ke dusron raste ko mauka dena chahta he
 What will happen to the chapter that teaches the lesson? kya uski tilanjali de di gai he
 By the way, the supporters of the conversation who are supporters of the Sangh's brother should be happy that the Sangh has also come with them
 jo sabak sikhaane vaale chapter liye baithe hai wo lonly feel kar sakate hai
 Dattatreya ji may have disappointed the defense beat puffs by telling Bhai Bhai's quarrel, while encouraging local beat journalists who covered the domestic fight
 vaise isi saal june main mathura main sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat kaa ek bayaan aayaa tha ki The entire subcontinent is a Hindu nation
 kisi ko shaq nahin hona chahie ki bharat bangladesh yaa pakistan me jo bhi rah rahe hai wo hindu raashtra kaa hissaa hai
 According to newspaper reports, they also called Pakistan and Bangladesh as Hindu nations
 unhone kaha ki unki naagarikta alag ho sakati he magar rashtriyata hindu he
 Was today's statement an extension of the Sangh chief's statement or has there been a new twist
 kya sangh ne pradhanmantri kii kisi line ko sweekaar kiya he
 Another important thing happened
 
 
 
 And this was said right before the arrival of this convoy of black trains of the Prime Minister
 dattatreya hasbhole ne kaha ki arthvyavastha kaa model pashchimi na hokar bhartiya mulyon par bane
 The government should pay attention to the education and medicine of the villagers so that their migration to the cities is stopped
 agar sangh vaaki aisa chahta he to use sarkaar ko shaabaashi dene se pehle bataanaa chahie tha ki arthvyavastha kaa koun sa faisla pashchimi model ko nakaar kar bhartiya mulyon ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 The comments smart city ke daur main kya kisi ke paas sachmuch aisa formula he yaa sangh ke paas he to kya sarkaar vaaki us par chalakar palaayan roak degi
 To increase migration, a smart city is being prepared so that India can become more urban
 kya ye sab kehane sunne ke liye acchhee baaten hai yaa mek in india ko is model main feet kar bahala phuslaa diya jayega
 The coordination of the two from the coordination meeting was not a message to the entire Sangh Parivar that they should get together in Bihar elections
 sarkaar sangh sab ek hai
 Pakistan Hindustan is brother
 wo koun hai jo in bhaaiyon ke bich jhagada kara rahe the
 Where will they go now? unhen prime time dekhnaa chahie

 Where will they go now? unhen prime time dekhnaa chahie
 The domestic industry of hostility is going to be good days in Pakistan
 pakistan ko lekar saare kanfuzan dur hue
 Sometimes neighbors, sometimes enemies and sometimes in the morning, people even start the process of going to a certain destination to go to Pakistan
 ab aise log kaan kholkar sun len
 The order has come from the biggest school to teach Pakistan that we are all brothers
 sangh or sarkaar ke bich chali teen dinon kii safal samanvay baithak ke baad aresas ke sah sar kaarywah dattatreya hasbhole ne kaha he ki bharat ke padosi deshon ke saath paariwarik or saanskrithik sambandh bhi hai
 Be it Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Pakistan or Bangladesh
 balki apane sharir se hi tuutakar wo bane hue hai do desh to
 
 pakistan or bangladesh
 So it is natural that the people living here belong to their own family
 kabhi-kabhi sambandhon main
 
 jaise bhai bhaiyon main bhi ho jaataa he
 This must have happened in a few decades
 lekin in sab ko bhuulakar ham padosi deshon ke saath saanskrithik sambandh
 
 apane itihaas ke saath
 
 bhugol ke saath jo jude hue hai
 
 wo or achche kaise ho sakate hai, is drushti se bhi thodaa padosi desh ke bare main vichaar kiya
 Journalist Smita Mishra also asked that there has been a rapid increase in the past few times from Pakistan, do you think it is possible for India to establish a brother-brother relationship
 to dattatreya hasbhole ne kaha ki bharat main kaurav or pandav bhi bhai bhai the
 Everything has to be done to establish a religion
 dharm sthapana ke liye sab karnaa padataa he
 But for the establishment of religion, there was a war between the Kaurava Pandavas
 kya hasbhole ji ne yah kah diya ki dharm ko lekar jo kaurav pandavon ke bich hua vaisaa kuch hone vaala he yaa ve ye kah rahe hai ki dharm yuddh se pehle kii tarah 105 bhai ek ho sakate hai
 Hearing this statement, i was a bit worried by Hurrian leader Gilani ji
 agar un par is bayaan kaa sakaaratmak asar ho gaya to kya pataa ve phir se suutakes lekar dilli ke chanakyapuri sthit pakistan duutavas aa jaye, udhar se sartaaj azeez sahab bhi aa jaaen

 Where will they go now? unhen prime time dekhnaa chahie
 After a three-day successful coordination meeting between the union and the government, RSS co-head Dattatreya Hasbole has said that India also has family and cultural ties with neighboring countries
 nepal, bhutan, srilanka, pakistan yaa bangladesh ho
 Rather, they are two countries, broken by their own bodies
 
 Pakistan and Bangladesh
 to swaabhaavik he yahaan rahane vaale log apane hi parivaar ke hai
 Sometimes in relationships
 
 Like brother gets into brothers also
 aisa kuch dashakon main hue honge
 But forgetting all these, we have cultural relations with neighboring countries
 
 With its history
 
 Those associated with geography
 
 In terms of how they could be better, they also thought about the neighboring country
 patrkaar smita mishra ne poocha bhi ki pakistan kii taraf se pichley kuch samay main tezi se ghatnaayen badhi hai, kya aapako lagata he ki bharat ke liye mumkin he bhai-bhai jaise sambandh sthapit kar paanaa
 So Dattatreya Hasbole said that Kauravas and Pandavas were also brothers in India
 dharm sansthapana ke liye sab karnaa padataa he
 Everything has to be done to establish a religion
 lekin dharm sansthapana ke liye hi to kaurav pandav ke bich yuddh hua tha
 Did Hasbole ji say that something like that happened between the Kaurava Pandavas about religion is going to happen or they are saying that 105 brothers can be the same as before the war of religion
 is bayaan ko sunate hi mujhe hurrian netaa gilaani ji thodi chintaa to hui
 If this statement had a positive effect on him, then what do he know that he should again take the suitcase to the Pakistan Embassy in Chanakyapuri, Delhi and Sartaj Aziz Saheb should also come there
 kya ab ye mulaakaaten bhai bhai ke siddhant ke tahat ho sakati hai
 Due to these meetings, the thing that the Prime Minister had promised in Ufa could not happen
 kya ab upha kii ulfat rang laaegi
 Is there a new different environment being created to make something new and bigger than before
 aakhir aresas ko kyon lag rahaa he ki bhai bhai kaa jhagada tha, civil court vaala, aatankwaad ko lekar jhagada nahin tha, tada court vaala
 Does the Sangh now want to leave the condition of terrorism and give opportunity to other way of culture and relations
 sabak sikhaane vaale chapter kaa kya hoga
 Has she been given a cry vaise sangh ke bhai bhai vaale bayaan se jo bhi baatcheet ke samarthak hai unhen khush hona chahie ki unke saath sangh bhi aa gaya he
 Those who are seated with lessons from the lesson can feel lonely
 bhai bhai kaa jhagada bataakar dattatreya ji ne dephence beet ke phufaaon ko niraash kiya hoga to gharelu jhagada cover karne vaale local beet ke patrakaron ko utsahit
 However, in June this year, a statement from Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat came in Mathura that puraa upmahadweep hi hindu raashtra he
 No one should doubt that those living in India, Bangladesh or Pakistan are part of the Hindu nation
 akhabaaron kii report ke anusaar unhone pakistan or bangladesh ko bhi hindu raashtra kah diya
 He said that his citizenship may be different but the nationality is Hindu
 kya aaj kaa bayaan sangh pramukh ke bayaan kaa vistaar tha yaa koi nayaa mode aayaa he
 Has the Sangh accepted any line of Prime Minister
 ek or mahatvapurn baat hui
 
 
 
 or ye baat thik pradhanmantri kii kaali gadiyon ke is kafile ke aane se pehle kahi gai
 Dattatreya Hasbole said that the model of economy should be based on Indian values rather than western
 sarkaar gaanv waalon kii kamai padhai or dawaai par dhyaan de taaki unka shaharon kii taraf palaayan ruke
 If the Sangh really wants to do this, then it should have told before giving praise to the government, which decision of the economy has been made on the basis of Indian values by rejecting the Western model
 tippaniyan In the era of smart city, does anyone really have such a formula or does the union have it, then will the government really stop migrating on it
 palaayan badhaane ke liye hi to smart city taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he taaki bharat or adhik shahari ho sake
 Are these all good things to hear or will Make in India be lured into this model
 samanvay baithak se donon kaa samanvay kahin puure sangh parivaar ko sandesh to nahin tha ki bihar chunaav main chalakar jute jaaiye

 With Noida being a high tech city, it has become a city of cyber thugs
 iskaa udhaaharan ek baar phir dekhne ko mila jab sibar thagon ne rashtriya junior profeshnal kabddi ke naam par 150 khilaadiyon se thagi kii
 Through the website, these players were first deposited in the account in the name of registration and they were called to Noida Stadium for trial on Monday
 lekin jab maukey par aayojakon kaa pataa nahin chalaa tab stadium prabandhan sahit khilaadiyon ne isaki shikaayat police se kii
 Like Senior Pro Kabaddi in Noida, around 150 players were called to the Noida Stadium for trials for the Under 15 and 17 trials in the name of Junior Professional Kabaddi
 jisamen ladke or ladkiyaan donon hi shaamil the
 Organizers www
 kbdjunior
 The online trial amount was called from the applicants through a website named com
 online raashi jamaa karne ke baad trial main shaamil hone ke liye khilaadiyon ko website ke madhyam se ek entry tikat bhi jari kiya gaya, jiske aadhaar par trial main hissaa lene kii baat kahi gai thi
 After the last date of registration, neither the website is opening nor the phone numbers of the organizers are being found
 yah bhi padhein: noida: garib or anaath kii madad ke naam par thagi karne vaala gang police giraft menmerut, gajiabad, saharanpur, bijanour sahit kai jilon ke khilaadiyon ko noida bulaayaa gaya tha
 All these players reached Noida Stadium with their coach at 8 am
 lekin inkaa trial lene ke liye koi aayojak maujuud nahin tha
 When these players from far and wide talked to the stadium management about this, they refused to have any such competition or trial
 unhone bataaya ki aise kisi aayojan ke liye stadium kii booking nahin kii gai he
 After this, the players who came to participate in the trial marched to the SP City office located in Noida Sector 6 and sat on the dharna
 jiske baad kuch peediton se espi city ne mulaakaat kii or mana ki unke saath dhokhadhadi hui he
 He handed over the investigation of the case to the cyber cell and the Kotwali police, taking the Tahrir from the victim players, including the stadium management
 pareshaaniyon se ghire pune sthit film and television institute of india (apatiai) ke chairman or abhinayta gajendra chouhan ko ab apane tivi ke saathiyon kaa sahaara mil rahaa he
 The cast of the popular TV serial 'mahabharata' has now come out in favor of Gajendra Chauhan aka 'yudhishthira'
 darasal, gajendra chouhan kii apatiai adhyakshata ko lekar sanstha ke chaatr or baaki sadsy kadaa virodh kar rahe hai
 But in this case, actor Punit Issar, who played the role of 'duryodhan' in 'mahabharata', while talking to Gajendra Chauhan, told NDTV that injustice is happening to his TV cousin
 punit kehete hai, "dukh kii baat he ki yah maamla bad se badtar hota ja rahaa he
 
 
 How can one question his ability without giving Gajendra a chance
 
 
 ? isaki kya guarantee he ki koi zyaada 'bada naam' apatiai ko behatar tareeke se chalaa paaegaa
 
 
 ? " is maamle main sirf 'duryodhana' hi nahin, 'mahabharat' main unke 'sautele bade bhai karn', yani abhinayta pankaj dheer bhi aisa hi kuch kehete nazar aate hai
 According to Pankaj, "if the government has assigned this task to Gajendra, then there must have been something in it
" 
 
 vaise bhi apatiai chairman kaa kaam padhaane kaa nahin, sanstha chalaane kaa he, isliye is post kaa chouhan ke acting kariyar se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 
 
 " pankaj dheer ne yah bhi kaha ki kai baar ausat teacher se padhakar bhi kai chaatr kuch bada kar jate hai
 Anyway, a lot of big personalities sat on the chair of FTII chairman, but they could not fulfill their responsibilities well
 in donon ke alaava 'mahabharat' ke 'mukhya khalnaayakon' main se ek 'shakuni' kii bhoomika adaa karne vaale gufi paintal ne kaha, "yah sach he ki apatiai ke purv adhyakshon kii tulana main gajendra ke paas utani yogyata nahin he, lekin agar sarkaar ko apane hi kisi aadmi ko bithaana tha to shatrughna sinha yaa hema malini ko bhi yah pad diya ja saktaa tha
 
 
 However i do not think it is right to oppose the students in this way
 
 
 gajendra ko khud ko sabit karne kaa mauka to ek baar milanaa chahie
 
 
 " in sabake bich 'mahabharat' ke 'bhishma pitamah', yani abhinayta mukesh khanna ne kaaphi khulkar apni baat saamne rakhi
 Mukesh took a strong stand and said that the government takes this decision and the students have no right to keep their conditions
 agar gajendra ko lagata he ki vah is laayak hai to unhen mauka diya janaa chahie
 If the students have problems then they should leave FTII, the thinking of the students is wrong
 tippaniyan It is worth noting that Mukesh Khanna has been campaigning for the Bharatiya Janata Party for the last 15 years and recently he has been appointed as the President of Children's Film Society
 vahiin 'draupadi' ke naam se pahachaani jane vaali roopa ganguli ne bhi is puure ghatnakram ke liye chaatro ko hi jimmedaar tehraaya he
 He also reiterated that once Gajendra was given a chance
 pashchim bengal main bhaajapa kii sadsy roopa ganguli maanati hai ki kisi ko is tarah apamaanit karnaa galat he
 Even though Gajendra's career has not been very memorable, but perhaps his luck was more to blame in this
 vaise bhi industry main har kisi ko uski kaabiliyat ke hisaab se maukey kahaan mil pate hai

 vaise bhi industry main har kisi ko uski kaabiliyat ke hisaab se maukey kahaan mil pate hai
 In this case, not only 'duryodhana', in the 'mahabharata', his 'elder elder brother Karna', that is, actor Pankaj Dheer also seems to say something similar
 pankaj ke mutabik, "agar sarkaar ne gajendra ko yah kaam saunpa he to usamen kuch to baat rahi hogi
 
 
 Anyway, the job of FTII chairman is not to teach but to run the organization, so this post has nothing to do with Chauhan's acting career
 
 
 " Pankaj Dhir also said that many students, after studying with the average teacher, sometimes make something big
 vaise bhi kaaphi badi hastiyaan apatiai ke chairman kii kursi par baithi, lekin ve apni jimmedaariyaan achche se nahin nibhaa pain
 Apart from these two, Goofy Pental, who played 'shakuni', one of the 'main villains' of 'mahabharata', said, "it is true that Gajendra does not have that much merit compared to former FTII presidents, but if If the government had to seat a man of its own, then this post could also be given to Shatrughan Sinha or Hema Malini
 
 
 haalanki mujhe nahin lagata ki chaatro kaa is tarah virodh karnaa sahi he
 
 
 Gajendra should get a chance to prove himself once
 
 
 " Amidst all this, 'bhishma Pitamah' of 'mahabharata', that is, actor Mukesh Khanna, spoke very openly
 mukesh ne kadaa rukh apanaate hue kaha ki yah faisla sarkaar leti he or chaatro ko apni sharten rakhane kaa koi haq nahin
 If Gajendra feels that he deserves this, then he should be given a chance
 agar chaatro ko samasya he to ve apatiai se chale jaaen, chaatro kii soch galat he
 The comments gauratlab he ki mukesh khanna pichley 15 saal se bhartiya janata party ke liye chunaav prachaar karte aa rahe hai or haal hi main unhen children film sosayadi kaa adhyaksh niyukt kiya gaya he
 At the same time, Roopa Ganguly, known as 'draupadi', has also held the students responsible for this whole incident
 unhone bhi ek baar gajendra ko mauka die jane kii baat doharaai
 In West Bengal, BJP member Roopa Ganguly believes that it is wrong to humiliate someone like this
 bhale hi gajendra kaa kariyar bahut yaadgaar na rahaa ho, lekin isamen shaayad unki kismat kaa dosha zyada tha

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki congress mukt bharat kaa unka naaraa raajnneetik rup se mukhya vipakshi dal ko samaapt karne kaa nahin balki desh ko congress samskruti se chhutkaaraa dilaane ke liye he
 He said that when i talk of Congress Mukt Bharat, it is not a matter of election results
 main chahta hum ki congress khud bhi congress samskruti se mukt ho, yah desh ke hit main hoga or ek swasth loktantr ke liye yah jaruri he
 In an interview to Times Now channel, PM Modi said that Congress has been the main pillar of the country's politics, whose culture was spread to all political parties
 unhone kaha ki congress mukt bharat kaa unka naaraa pratikatmak he or vah chaahate hai ki congress bhi ‘congress samskruti’ se mukt ho jaae
 For the first time, the PM spoke so elaborately on his 'congress Mukt Bharat' slogan, which he gave in the first campaign of 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 congress shasit rajyabta den ki bijepi dwaara die 'congress mukt bharat' naare ko vah raajnneetik hathiyaar par istemaal karti
 The Congress was reduced to 44 seats in the Lok Sabha elections
 iske baad baad kai rajyon main congress ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa he or satta bhi gavanni padi he
 The Congress now runs the government only in Punjab, Puducherry, Karnataka and the northeastern states of Meghalaya and Mizoram
 meghalaya main farvari main chunaav kaa elaan ho chukaa he
 Modi said that the slogan became famous but the sentiment behind it could not be effectively transmitted as things are often said to be in a hurry in the flow of politics
 unhone kaha ki jab vah congress mukt bharat kii baat karte hai to vah congress ke kisi sanghathan yaa ikai ke rup main hone tak simit nahin hai
 He claimed, 'the culture of Congress that emerged after independence started influencing other political parties
 unhen lagata he ki kisi ek raste par chalanaa safal sabit hoga
 Casteism, dynasty, corruption, exploitation, treachery and occupation of power completely
 ye sab bhartiya raajnneetik samskruti kaa hissaa ban gaya jiskaa mukhya stambh congress thi
 Modi said that even during the freedom struggle, the Congress had a culture that inspired the youth to sacrifice for the country
 congress samskruti kaa zikr karte hue unhone kaha ki ye ‘khamiyaan’ ek had tak sabhi dalon main dekhi gai
 Political parties have to protect from this culture and preserve the political character of the country
 unhone kaha ki aane vaali pidiyon ko is samskruti se bachaana hoga
 Therefore, what i am saying is just a symbol

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has used Modi's Congress Mukt Bharat slogan from time to time to attack the BJP
 unhone kaha tha ki vah bijepi kii vichaardhaara se ladenge lekin use kabhi puri tarah samaapt nahin karnaa chahenge kyonki yah bhi samaaj ke ek varg kii abhivyakti he
 Empowering women from the triple talaq bill Taking a dig at the Congress for opposing the triple talaq bill in the Rajya Sabha, the Prime Minister said that he should get rid of this backward thinking instead of doing vote bank politics
 modi ne kaha ki unhen vishwaas he ki rajeev gandhi ke pradhanmantri rahane ke dauraan congress ne jo galati kii thi usase kuch sabak lenge
 Prime Minister Modi said that this step was so that all should live with respect
 congress is samaaj seva ko kyon nahin samaj pai yah chintaa kaa vishay he
 Has politics fallen so much? Is the power hunger so much that they can see innocent mother and sisters suffering and still doing their politics
 yah bahut swarthpurna he
 It hurts me
 ' modi ne kaha ki maahaul bhi badal gaya he or duniyabar main islamic deshon ne bhi apane kanoon badale hai
 Let me tell you that in the year 1985, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of divorced woman Shah Bano who demanded alimony from her husband
 haalanki kattarpanthi muslim samoohon kii tikhi pratikriya ke baad rajeev gandhi kii aguwai vaali congress ne baad main ek kanoon ke madhyam se faisle ke praavdhaanon ko halkaa kar diya tha
 Modi said that Congress Party or any other party doing vote bank politics should get rid of this backward thinking and look at women empowerment and women with respect
 modi ne daawa kiya ki yah vidheyak raajnneetik kadam nahin he balki ek baar main teen talaak kehane kii kupratha se prabhavit muslim mahilaon ko bachaane ke uddeshy se he

 The game of the use of words is such that if it is not used properly then our objective, despite being right, has an adverse effect on the front
 agar aapane himesh reshmia kaa gaanaa' dard dilon ke kam ho jate main or tum gar ham ho jate' suna hoga to bakhubi 'main' or 'ham' kaa antar aap samaj gaye honge

 Advantage in friendship: Whenever you say 'I' among friends, your friends do not feel close to you
 vahiin, 'ham' bolne se vah ek atmik rup se jud jate hai
 Partner of happiness and sorrow: When someone says that we are with you in a crisis, then the person in front feels that he is not alone
 uske dukh main sab uske saath hai
 Development of collective spirit: 'I' increases individualism, while 'we' increase collectivism and mutual brotherhood
 rishton main sudhaar:agar aapaki jindagi main aapke gharavaalon ke saath aapasi rishte sahi nahin chal rahe hai, to aapane kabhi sochaa he ki aapke 'main' kehane kii aadat se to yah kadavaahat nahin aa rahi he
 If you start taking responsibility for every success and failure by saying 'we', you will find that it will strengthen the relationship to an extent
 swaarth nahin dikhegaa:'main' shabd kaa istemaal baar -baar karke aap apane ko swaarthee dikhaate hai, jabaki 'ham' kaa istemaal karke aap swaarth se upar uth jate hai

 On behalf of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the rally in Jagdalpur on Friday
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apane bhaashan kii shuruyaat chhattisgadhi bhashaa main kii
 The PM said that on the day of the festival of Brotherhood, i have come to ask you for something
 ab tak desh main jitne bhi pradhanmantri hue hai, unase zyada baar main akelaa bastar aayaa hum
 Whenever i have come, i have not come empty handed
 PM modi ne kaha ki pehle kii sarkaron kaa kaarobaar tera-meraa kaa tha, main aaj apni jimmedaari adaa karne aayaa hum
 The responsibility is to remove the difficulties of the people here
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki pehle kii sarkarein mere-tere ke khel main uljhi raheen, lekin hamaara makasad sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas he
 People are surprised to see the development of Chhattisgarh
 'urban naksaliyon ke samarthan main bolti he congress'pradhanmantri ne kaha ki pehle kii sarkarein kahati thim ki naksaliyon kii vajah se yahaan kaa vikaas nahin ho rahaa he
 But our government made development in the face of all the difficulties
 jo urban maovadi hai wo shaharon main asi main rahete hai or unke bachche videshon main padhate hai, lekin vahaan baithe-baithe adivasee bacchon kii jindagi barbaad karne kaa kaam karte hai
 Congress party stands in favor of Urban Maoists, Congress is cultivating votes by making Naxalism an issue
 'bastar main koi or naa aa paae'pradhanmantri ne kaha ki bastar kii har seat par camel khilanaa chahie, agar or koi aa gaya to bastar ke sapanom main daag laga denge
 We have to fulfill Atal ji's dreams, that's why we have repeatedly come to Chhattisgarh
 chhattisgarh ab 18 saal kaa ho rahaa he, isliye ham iske sapanom ko puraa kar rahe hai
 He said that the central government and the Raman Singh government of the state are continuously working for the development of Chhattisgarh
 'chhattisgarh kaa vikaas rokatii thi upie sarkaar'jab chhattisgarh bana to shuruyaat main congress kii sarkaar bani, inhone shuru main hi iske saath galat kar diya
 But in a short time, people made sense and chose the Bharatiya Janata Party
 BJP kii sarkaar ne 15 saal tak chhattisgarh ke vikaas ke liye khun-pasinaa bahaya he
 PM said that when there was UPA government at the center, Raman Singh did not help the government
 dilli kii sarkaar chhattisgarh ke saare kaam ko atkana chaahati thi
 'got double engine of development after 2014' PM Modi said that since 2014, development of Chhattisgarh got double engine, one Delhi engine and Raipur engine
 hamaari sarkaar ne chhattisgarh ke 9000 gaanvon ko sadakon se roak diya, rajya main neshnal hive kaa nayaa jaal bana diya gaya he
 Congress always sees Dalit-victims as vote banks, never as human beings
 atal ji kii sarkaar ne pehali baar adivaasiyon ke liye alag se mantralay banaaya tha
 The Prime Minister said that the Congress party makes fun of the costumes of the tribals, their living
 jab mujhe adivaasiyon ne pagadi pahanaai, to congress ne uskaa majaak udaaya
 Since then, the tribals of the Northeast are angry with the Congress, now the Congress people do not dare to say something like that
 ek samay par congress ne adivaasiyon ko goliyon se bhun diya tha
 The Prime Minister said that the Naxalites killed a journalist, he had just come here to do his work
 lekin congress party in naksaliyon ko krantikari kahati he, jinhone nirdosh ko maar diya wo inhen krantikari lag rahe hai
 Those who want to end democracy, give a befitting reply by voting more

 In the first phase, elections to these seats will be held, there will be voting in two phases in the assembly elections in Chhattisgarh

 Of these seats, 12 seats are reserved for Scheduled Tribes and one seat for Scheduled Castes
 raman singh banaam karunaa shuklapahale charan main rajanandgaanv se mukhyamantri raman singh or purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kii bhatijikarunaa shukla chunaav maidan main hai
 At the same time, the fate of two Raman cabinet members and a BJP MP is also to be decided in the first phase
 rajya main bhartiya janata party pichley 15 varshon se satta main he or is baar vah 65 siton par jeet ke saath chauthi baar sarkaar banane kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 At the same time, the Congress is trying to come to power this time
 rajya main sarkaar bachaane or banane ke liye bhaajapa or congress ne apni takat jhonk di he
 Here, former state Chief Minister Ajit Jogi's party Janata Congress is contesting in alliance with Chhattisgarh (J) Bahujan Samaj Party, which is likely to be a triangular contest in many seats
 rajya main varsh 2013 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main 90 siton main se 49 siton par bhaajapa ne or 39 siton par congress ne jeet hasil kii thi
 At the same time, BSP and independent candidates won one seat each

 The story of Mumbai's Vrishali Pispati from an investment banker to a social worker is very interesting
 apane bete kii dekharekh karne ke liye 42 saal kii vrushali ne thode samay ke liye kariyar se brake liya tha
 During this time she joined an NGO called Mumbai Mobile Crèches, which works in the fields of health, education and safety of children of construction workers

 aam aadmi party or congress ke bich gathbandhan kii charchaa, ek nae mode par aakar khadi ho gai he
 On the one hand, while the nomination time for the candidates is coming to a close, both the political parties are unable to take any concrete decision regarding the alliance
 haal hi main gathbandhan kii charchaa ke liye band hue daravaaje, aam aadmi party or congress ne apni apni sharton ke saath dobaaraa khol die hai
 On Saturday, Manish Sisodia, deputy CM in the Aam Aadmi Party government, held a press conference for the first time at the party headquarters regarding an alliance with the Congress
 sisodiya ne congress par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki congress kii taraf se gathbandhan ko lekar dheelaapan apanaaya ja rahaa he
 The Congress is unable to take any decision on a small issue, due to which the precious time of 1 month has been wasted
 congress se gathbandhan kii vajah ginate hue manish sisodiya ne bataaya ki abhi pichley 1 hafte se dobaaraa se congress ne aam aadmi party ke varisht netaaon ke saath baatcheet shuru kii he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has proposed to stop the BJP in 33 Lok Sabha seats in front of the Congress
 in 33 siton main 7 siten dilli kii, 10 siten haryana kii, 13 siten punjab kii, 1 seat chandigarh kii or 2 siten goa kii shaamil hai
 At present 23 out of these 35 seats are BJP mps
 sisodiya ne kaha ki agar congress hamaare is prastaav par gaur karti to 2014 ke mukaable sidhe-sidhe taur par 23 siton kaa nuksaan bhaajapa ko pahunchataa
 Questioning the intent of the Congress on the alliance, Manish Sisodia said that the Congress has deliberately delayed taking any decision
 aisa nahin he ki congress is par nirnay nahin le sakati thi, parantu jaan boojhkar kabhi ek netaa ke dwaara to kabhi duusare netaa ke dwaara alag-alag baaten kahi gai
 However, this interesting quarrel started on Friday when Congress leader PC Chacko, who talked to the Aam Aadmi Party for the alliance, said that the Aam Aadmi Party wanted to negotiate seats in Haryana and Punjab as well, due to which 7 seats in Delhi But the agreement could not be reached
 dilli main congress kaa formula 4-3 kaa tha, yani 4 seat aam aadmi party or 3 seat par congress
 PC Chacko said that if the Aam Aadmi Party only wants an alliance in Delhi, then the Congress is ready for talks even today
 congress netaa pisi chaako ke prastaav par palatwaar karte hue shanivaar ko manish sisodiya ne kaha ki "hamaare prastaav par congress ne kaha, ki keval dilli kii 7 siton par gathbandhan karenge
 By doing this, does the Congress want to win the BJP in the remaining 26 seats? The Aam Aadmi Party has an absolute majority government in Delhi, and the Aam Aadmi Party can win seven seats on its own in Delhi, but winning the seats in Delhi alone is not the goal of the Aam Aadmi Party
 ab yah congress ko tay karnaa he ki is samay unki praathamikta modi or shah kii jodi ko haraana he yaa zyada siton par chunaav ladane kaa record bananaa he
 At the moment, Manish Sisodia has put a new proposal before the Congress
 sisodiya ne kaha ki goa kaa time nikal chukaa he, to us par baat karnaa vyarth he, or congress kii maane to punjab main donon hi partiyaan, ek paksh main he or duusari vipaksh main he vahaan bhi gathbandhan na karnaa ek baar ko samaj aata he lekin haryana or chandigarh main gathbandhan ne karne kaa kya kaaran he? agar congress chaahe to abhi bhi samay he, modi or shah kii jodi ko 18 siton par haraaya ja saktaa he
 If the Congress is ready to form alliances in Delhi as well as Haryana and Chandigarh, then the Aam Aadmi Party is also ready for an alliance
 aam aadmi party or congress main gathbandhan kaa jhagada tej hone kii ek vajah namakan kaa samay bhi he, jo dhire-dhire nazadik aa rahaa he
 According to the information, the notification will be issued on April 16 for the Lok Sabha elections to be held on May 12
 yani is din se chunaav ladane ke icchhuk ummidavaar namakan kar sakenge
 While the last date for filing nominations will be April 23
 iske baad chunaav karyaalay 24 ko namakan patron kii jaanch karegaa, to vahiin 26 april tak naam waapas liya ja sakegaa
 Let me tell you that Lok Sabha elections are to be held in seven seats of Delhi

 com / kosrnbdgoj Congress, the country's oldest party, is still not ready for change
 party ne loksabhaa chunaav main jo karaari shikast jheli he, usase laga tha ki vah apane ko samay ke anusaar badalegi
 But not
 abhi bhi vahaan kuch nayaa, krantikari yaa abhootpurv sa hota nahin dikhataa he
 The party is behaving like a stray boat in Mahasamudra
 use pataa nahin he ki use janaa kahaan he
 After such a huge defeat, people felt that the party would prepare itself from a new level
 lekin party main itnaa nirnay he ki use kuch nahin sujh rahaa he
 Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi is not particularly interested in carrying the party
 ve loksabhaa main party ke netaa banane ko taiyaar nahin the lihaaja mallikarjun khadge ko netaa bana diya gaya
 Kharge may be a skilled parliamentarian and a settled leader, but there is no dearth of better and smarter leaders in the party
 lekin aisa lagata he ki sonia gandhi ke salaahkaaron ne yah naam chunaa he
 It is also necessary to say a word here about Sonia Gandhi's advisors
 ye salaahkaar parde ke peeche se kaam karne vaale mutthi bhar log hai
 They are not grassroots leaders and have never dealt with vote politics
 aise log sonia gandhi ko kisi raay dete honge, iskaa andaja aasaani se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 As far as Rahul Gandhi is concerned, he is not much interested in playing the role of active leader in the party and in such a situation he kept a tight silence on this choice
 behatar hota party ek loktantric tareeke se lok sabha main netaa kaa chunaav karti
 But it is not the tradition of the Congress to do so
 band kamaron se jari farmaan par yah party chalati he or isliye is mahasankat kaa koi hal dhundh nahin paa rahi he
 There is no hurry to reorganize the party after the defeat there
 party main ek vidroh punap rahaa he
 a confrontation between the new ideology and the old thinking is clearly visible
 lekin party aalaa kaman kii ore se koi bhi pahal hoti nahin dikh rahi he
 It seems that the Congress has become a victim of policy paralysis just like the UPA government
 sabase dilachasp baat to yah he ki party vanshavaad se mukti paane kaa koi prayaas bhi nahin kar rahi he, haalanki kai mahatvapurn netaa is tarah ke sanket de rahe hai
 They want the party to think in this direction and strengthen its roots so that in the coming time it can contest elections on its own
 jo log yaa sansthaaen diwaar par likhi ibaarat nahin pard pate hai unka bhavishya andhakaarmay hota he
 The same situation is with the Congress because there is no member of the Gandhi family with a charismatic personality nor a politician with original ideas
 jaahir he yah party apane sadasyon kii soch or unki mehnat se hi uth paaegi
 But how will all this happen? In turn, it comes to the advisors of Sonia Gandhi, who runs the country from behind the scenes and has her own agenda
 to intjaar kiijie ki party kab or kaise apana aglaa or bada kadam uthaati he

 Nobody really knows what is Digvijay Singh's intention
 patni amrutha or koi 90 anya logon ke saath, congress mahasachiv 30 sitambar ko chah maheene ke liye narmada parikrama par nikal pade, 3,300 kilometre kii paidal yatra par, jo madhya pradesh or gujarat main nadi ke maarg kii parikrama karegi
 But is this the 'spiritual quest' they claim? Or is there a comprehensive political plan to reestablish himself and the Congress in his home state? Whatever it may be, Raja (as Digvijay is commonly called in Madhya Pradesh) has taken on his rivals in both BJP and Congress Has applied force
 10 aktubar ko, hoshangabad jile ke maaragaanv main unhone asaamaanya vinamrata ke saath kaha tha, ''yah ek puri tarah se aadhyatmik khoj he or jaraa bhi rajnatik nahin he
 i am always judged excessively as a leader and less as a person
 '' yatra ke dauraan kafile main shaamil hue samarthakon or party kaaryakartaaon ko digvijay ne unke or congress ke liye narebaaji karne par daant bhi diya
 He also avoided making political remarks
 unki 'khoj' main baari hindu dharmik pratikatmakataa he, jisamen lagaataar aaratiyaan hoti hai, bhagava kaa atirek pradarshan he, or yahaan tak ki ek mobile mandir bhi he, jisamen nirantar puja hoti rahati he
 The parikrama passes from village to village, in which 'narmade har! People are greeted with the slogan '
 vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki sabase kam str par is tirthayatra se digvijay ko vah 'hindu-virdohi' label hataane main madad milegi, jise unhone pichley varshon main hasil kiya he
 He says, "I am a very religious person, but my religion tells me to respect all other religions
" ''unke baar-baar manaa karne ke baavjood parikrama main najar aane ke liye kataribaddh tareeke se pesh hone vaale congress ke netaaon ko alag-alag baaten najar aa rahi hai
 Bundelkhand Congress leader Brijendra Singh Rathore said, "I have come here to show solidarity with Digvijay Singh
 '' ve kehete hai ki jab digvijay unke bich main jate hai, to party kaaryakarta utsahit mahasoos karte hai
 And although he refuses to make any political remarks, what he sees in the villages, such as changes in the pattern of crops, pollution in the Narmada, lowering of river water levels, fishery problems, etc
 Noting all of them with hard work
 ve kehete hai, ''main apni ankhen or kaan band nahin kar saktaa
 "the special thing is that a few months ago, the Namami Devi Narmade Yatra of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan passed through this route
 gaanv kii deevaaron par chitrit us yatra ke naare abhi bhi fike nahin hue hai
 Rajesh Patel, a Congress worker from Kondarwara, a village on the route, says, "people are comparing a king's view of a helicopter to a king and walking like a common man
" '' 11 aktubar kii dopaher ko digvijay ne nasirabad main sankshipt vishram kiya tha, jahaan se narmadapar siem chaihaan kaa paitruk gaanv jait he
 Digvijay must be thinking something
 aakhirkaar chouhan hi hai, jo madhya pradesh ke sabase lambey samay tak mukhyamantri rahane vaale ke taur par digvijay ke record ko paar kar chuke hai
 The residents of Jait have said that they will welcome Digvijay when they reach the village of Parikrama in February next year
 yahaan ke dharmendra chouhan kehete hai, ''vaise hi, jaise ham parikrama karne vaale sabhi logon kaa swaagat karte hai
 On the question of the yatras being political, he said with mocking laughter, "digvijay's yatra is 100 percent political and Shivraj Chauhan's yatra was 120 percent political

 The second question for children from PM was, did teachers contribute more in your life, or experiences? The Prime Minister replied that for me both are very important
 narendra modi se bacchon kaa teesraa sawaal rahaa, kya aapane bachapan main sochaa tha, pradhanmantri banenge, vishwaprasiddh honge
 
 
 The Prime Minister replied, never thought that i would become PM, i could never even become a monitor in class
 hamen jivan main kuch banane ke nahin, kuch karne ke sapane dekhne chahie, kyonki karte-karte kuch ban gaye to ban gaye, nahin bane to koi baat nahin
 The pleasure of doing something gives a lot of happiness in itself
 narendra modi se bacchon kaa chauthaa sawaal, ham jaise bacchon se baatcheet kar aapako kya laabh miltaa he? pradhanmantri kaa jawaab, bahut saare kaam hote hai, jo laabh ke liye nahin kiye jate or iskaa alag anand hota he

 The children asked Modi the eighth question: In a lazy but clever child and hard working child, who will you pay attention to? The Prime Minister replied that if i were a teacher, i would not discriminate against any child
 koi bhi teacher bacchon se bhedbhaav nahin karata
 The ninth question of children was to Narendra Modi, do you remember the mischief done during your student days? The Prime Minister said that the development of children stops without mischief
 unhone kaha ki bachapan main vah khud bhi bahut shararti the or doston ke saath shehanai bajaane waalon ko imali dikhaate the, taaki uske munh main pani aa jaae or use shehanai bajaane main dikkat ho

 Oli, who was in coalition government with the Maoists at the time, entered into a trade and transit treaty with China, similar to the treaty Nepal has with India
 kuch hi dinon baad oli kii sarkaar gir gai
 Doubts were raised that this was done with the help of India
 isse nepal main bharat virdohi lahar ko or hawa mili
 Nepal held re-elections and the left-wing UML / Maoist coalition won a three-quarter majority in parliament and formed governments in six of the seven provinces formed under the new federal structure
 yah sab bharat ke liye bade jatke jaisaa tha
 So, taking unusual initiative, India sent foreign minister Sushma Swaraj to Kathmandu and expressed India's goodwill towards the government of Nepal under Oli's leadership
 haalanki tab tak nae pradhanmantri ke rup main oli kaa shapathgrahan abhi hua bhi nahin tha
 All eyes were on Oli's recent visit to India
 videsh niti ke jaankaar najar gadaaye the or yah samajhane kii koshish kar rahe the ki haal ke varshon main donon taraf paidaa hue avishvaas kaa kitna asar bharat-nepal rishton par dikhegaa
 The tour was very smooth and the credit goes to both Oli and Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 donon hi pakshon ne ateet kii galatchhemiyon ko kuredne ke badale, aapasi sahyog kii vishaal sambhaavnaaon ke maddenjar ise or majboot karne kii jarurat par bal diya
 India announced that it would provide financial assistance to connect Raxaul in Bihar to Kathmandu in Nepal by rail network and to connect Bihar and Nepal by waterways
 nepal kaa maanas badalane ke liye yah masterstroke tha
 The two countries signed important agreements to increase cooperation in the field of agriculture as well
 madheshiyon ko 1950 kii sandhi main shaamil karne ke liye samvidhan sanshodhan or china ke belt and road (biarai) ke liye nepal ke samarthan jaise asahaj muddon par is yatra main charchaa nahin hui
 Oli, in contrast to his earlier view, was seen this time talking about building greater economic relations with India
 bharat-nepal sambandhon kaa moolmantra ab tak suraksha par aadhaarit rahaa he lekin ab donon desh vikaas ke mantra ke saath aapasi rishton ko aage badhayenge
 During the interaction with the business houses of India, he invited investment in the fields of hydropower, tourism, agriculture, SME and export based industries and assured all kind of cooperation towards creating a conducive environment for Indian investors
 bharat yatra ke dauraan oli china ke saath nepal ke sambandhon ko majboot karne ke prati, apana paksh bahut sahajata se rakhte dekhe gaye
 He said that the intensification of Nepal's relations with China will not hurt Indian interests
 oli ke jald hi china kii yatra par jane kii bhi sambhaavna jataai ja rahi he
 There will be some new announcements in China visit that will make New Delhi's ears stand again
 bhavishya main kuch apratyaashit nahin ghatata, to agle kuch varshon tak oli nepal ke pradhanmantri bane rahenge or nepal lambey antaraal ke baad rajnatik sthirataa kaa anand legaa
 Oli's image is anti-india in Nepal and leaning towards China
 bharat ko aashaa he ki apni dilli yatra ke dauraan oli ne jis rajnatik sooyeeboojh kaa parichay diya he, vah aage bhi jari rahegi or bharat nepal main china ke lagaataar badhate prabhaav ko kuch had tak rokane main kaamyaab hoga

 loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon se jo aankaden aae hai wo chaunkaane vaale hai
 According to this Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal himself has lost his seat and is at number three
 nai dilli vidhansabha main jahaan 2015 main kejarivil ne shila dikshit ko haraaya tha vahaan is baar khud congress se peeche hai
 According to this Lok Sabha election, the Congress has got 26 thousand 312 votes while the Aam Aadmi Party has got 14 thousand 740 votes
 yahi nahin najafagarh se kejariwal sarkaar main mantri kailash gahalot bhi tisare number par hai, yahaan congress ko loksabhaa ke voton ke anusaar 23 hajaar 354 vot milegein to aap ko 22 hajaar 302 vot
 If based on these figures, the constituency-wise seats of the assembly are matched, then out of the 70 seats in Delhi, BJP could win 65 seats and Congress 5 seats whereas Aam Aadmi Party's account also does not appear
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad mili aankadon ke anusaar bijepi jahaan 65 siton par aage he vahiin vah 5 siton par duusare number par he jabaki congress 5 seat jeet rahi he or 42 siton par duusare number par he or 23 siton par tisare number par
 The Aam Aadmi Party is not winning a single seat while in 23 seats it is in the second position and in 47 seats in the third place
 maujuuda aankadon ke anusaar bijepi ko 56
 5% votes have been received which is almost 10% more than in 2014
 or 2015 ke vidhansabha ke mukaable saade 24 fisadi adhik he
 While Congress got 22
 5 fisadi vot mili hai jo 2014 ke mukaable 7
 5 per cent more and 12 and a half per cent more than the 2015 assembly
 vahiin aam aadmi party ke aankadon ko dekhen to use is loksabhaa chunaav main keval 18 fisadi vot mili hai, jo 2014 ke lok sabha chunaav ke mukaable saade 14 fisadi kam hai
 Whereas, compared to the 2015 assembly, the vote has reduced by 31
5%
 yani aam aadmi party kaa soupada saaf he
 Now the Aam Aadmi Party needs to introspect how to save the party as it has three mps in Rajya Sabha and only one MP in Lok Sabha
 haalanki yahaan yah daleel jarur di ja rahi he ki loksabhaa or vidhansabha ke chunaav alag alag muddon par lade jate hai or yah karnama aam aadmi party ne 2015 main karke dikhaaya he jab 2014 main ek bhi loksabhaa kii seat nahin jeetne vaali aap ne vidhansabha main 67 siten jiti thim or use apane muhalla clinics or sarkari skulon ke kayakalp karne jaise kaamon par bharosa he
 But the figures for the current Lok Sabha elections are also indicating a lot
 chunaav ke dauraan kejariwal kaa vah bayaan aapako yaad hoga jisamen unhone kaha tha ki musalmaan congress ko to vot nahin de rahaa he or hindu bhi nahin vot karne vaala he magar aankadon ne ise galat sabit kiya he
 Congress is the number two party in the assembly and AAP is number three in the assembly like Muslim-majority Ealaks like Seelampur, Babarpur, Mustafabad, Ballimaran, Matiamhal, Chandni Chowk and Okhla
 yani aam aadmi party ke liye sankat kaaphi gaharaa he raahat kii baat ye he ki aap ke paas abhi kuch maheenon kaa vakt he jisase wo apni haalat sudhaar saktaa he varanaa aam aadmi party dhire dhire jis tarah ubhari thi usee tarah khatm ho jaaegi kyoki punjab or goa main uskaa koi bhavishya nahin he or naa hi haryana main or naa hi aap main kejariwal kisi or ko netaa ke rup main ubharne dena chaahate hai
