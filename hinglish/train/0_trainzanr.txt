 cancer se jang lard rahe goa ke mukhyamantri manohar parrikar ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi par ochhi raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaate hue bada palatwaar kiya he
 On the meeting with the Congress President a day ago, Parrikar said that Rahul has done this meeting only for his political benefit
 parrikar ne rahul par raajnneetik avasarvadita kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Parrikar wrote a letter to Congress President Rahul Gandhi and said that you came to meet me for your political benefit
 mere saath bitaye 5 minuton main na to aapane rafel kaa zikr kiya or naa hi usase sambandhit kisi anya bare main charchaa kii
 Parrikar said - Rahul gave a false statement
 Parrikar said that making such a low level of politics in a courtesy meeting makes a false statement in my mind about the honesty of your journey
 main media main ai khabar padhakar vyathit hum ki aapane kaha ki main is prakriya main shaamil nahin tha
 i think you are using this journey for political gain
 parrikar ne rahul gandhi kii us bayaan kii ninda kii jisamen rahul ne kaha tha ki mangalvaar kii mulaakaat ke dauraan parrikar ne unase kaha tha ki rafel deal kii unhen koi jaankaree nahin thi
 What did Rahul Gandhi say while addressing the Youth Congress at Talkatora Stadium in Delhi, Rahul said that yesterday i met Parrikar
 unhone khud kaha tha ki deal badalte samay pradhanmantri ne raksha mantri se nahin poocha tha
 Rahul said that the President of France told that Modi told him that if the contract is needed for the world's largest deal, then Anil Ambani will have to give the contract
 iske baad HAL kaa contract chin liya gaya
 Parrikar has retaliated on this same statement of Rahul
 Dear Rahul Gandhi, you showed how insensitive you are, by lying in the name of a person fighting a disease
 The people of India are disgusted by your reckless behavior
 In his trademark style,@manoharparrikarji sets the record straight

 aapke is vyavhaar se desh ke log nafrat karte hai
 Goa Minister said - should not be politics, Goa Minister Mowin Godinho also said that Rahul Gandhi should not do politics on the meeting with Parrikar
 movin ne kaha ki bhale hi ham alag-alag raajnneetik dalon se hon, lekin jab ham ek duusare ke prati shishtachar jataate hai to isamen raajnneeti shaamil nahin kerani chahie
 Rahul Gandhi went to meet Parrikar on Tuesday, it is said that Rahul Gandhi suddenly reached Parrikar on Tuesday
 parrikar se mulaakaat ke baad unhone twit kiya ki aaj subah main goa ke mukhyamantri manohar parrikar se sheeghra swasth hone kii shubhakamana dene ke liye milane gaya

 Senior Congress leader and former foreign minister SM Krishna has questioned the leadership of the party's National Vice President Rahul Gandhi
 aaj tak se khaas baatcheet main krishna ne kaha ki jaipur adhiveshan ke daawey karnataka chunaav main phuss ho gaye he or party ne galat ummidavaaron ko tikat diya he
 Earlier in the press meet program organized by Press Club of Bangalore and Bangalore Reporters Guild, Krishna said that he has taken an active part in the selection process of the candidate since 1972
 unhone kaha ki tab chayan samiti main 15 se 16 sadsy hua karte the, jisamen gambhir charchaa hoti thi
 He said that the committee had about 60 members this time
 is samiti main vah bhi shaamil the
 He described it as complicated
 yah puche jane par ki kya congress ‘saavadhi jamaa’ (1999-2004 ke bich mukhyamantri ke taur par unke dwaara kiye gaye achche kaary) ko bhunaane main vifal rahi he? unhone kaha, ‘pichley netaaon dwaara kiye gaye achche kaaryon kaa laabh lene ke liye chaturaai, budhimata or rajnatik kushaagratha honi chahie
 Those who say that it is not needed, then it is their loss
 yah unka nuksaan nahin he jinhone ise arjeet kiya
 The former chief minister refused to predict which party would come to power
 unhone kaha, ‘janadesh kaa anumaan lagaana kathin he
 People do not share secrets (who they will vote for)
 kai baar, chunaav main baat bighad jaati he, kyonki jin logon se sampark kiya jaataa he ve gumraah karne vaali soochna dete hai
 Krishna said that when the Congress won a landslide victory in 1999, Ghulam Nabi Azad, the then incharge of the party's Karnataka affairs, led the party's efforts from the front despite severe pain in the back
 vah samooche prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan rajya ikai ke saath the
 Krishna said, 'some kind of catalyst must emerge that unites everyone and moves forward with us
 ’yah puche jane par ki kya vah mandya main party kaa netritv karenge to unhone film abhinayta ambareesh kaa naam liye bina kaha, ‘main vahaan kya karuunga jab vahaan aise netaa hai jo apane dam par jeetne kii kshamta rakhane vaale dasiyon ummidavaar laa sakate hai
 Krishna is reportedly having a dispute with cine actor-turned-politician h Ambarish there
 yah puche jane par ki kya maujuuda raajnneeti (khud ko darkinar kiye jane se) se udhaas hai to krishna ne kaha, ‘raajnneeti kabhi udhaas nahin karti he’ or unhone duglas macarthar ke bhaashan ko uddhrut karte hue kaha, ‘puraane sainik kabhi nahin marate
 They have just become weaker
 ’is congress netaa ne kaha, ‘main sirf ghar par baithkar chintan-manan nahin kar rahaa hum
 i have other hobbies like music, tennis and yoga
 mujhe unase kaaphi santosh miltaa he
 Krishna was of the opinion that the pre-election manifesto has lost its ground and relevance at the present time
 party ke chunaav ghoshnaa patr jari karne ke kaarykram se alag rahe krishna ne kaha, ‘sattarudh party chunaav ghoshnaa patr ko tabhi yaad karti he jab koi use yaad dilaataa he or jab vipaksh ke netaa vidhansabha main charchaa ke dauraan iskaa zikr karte hai
 At that time no Legislative Agreement is found in the State Secretariat, and they have to be obtained from the Congress office
 ’ There is no decrease in the number of students in all these colleges
 kahin ek hazaar pard rahe hai to kahin do se teen hazaar bhi pard rahe honge
 They will also charge college fees
 kya aap jaanate hai ki unke saath kya hota hoga
 What would they get out of studying without a professor-lecturer
 desh ke tamaam rajyon main javaaniyon ko barbaad karne kaa rashtriya project chal rahaa he
 Your attention should not go this way, so the leaders are creating various issues from morning till evening
 jab is desh main shikshak hi nahin hai to chaatr pard kaise rahe hai
 Without being a master, can India be a world guru? kai saal se ye halaat hai
 Everywhere from Bihar to Rajasthan, UP to Madhya Pradesh, the education budget is being spent only in the maintenance of buildings
 padhaane waalon par kuch nahin ho rahaa he
 Lalit Narayan Mithila University is very bad
 magar in ilaake ke logon ko yah haal kyon nahin dikhaa, meri samaj se baahar he
 We have taken all this data from the budget of the university which is sent to the state government
 2017-18 ke bajet patr ke anusaar puure vishvavidhyalay main 1918 pad sweekrut hai magar 1918 se maatr 488 shikshak hi padhaa rahe hai
 1430 posts are empty
 50 fisadi se bhi kam prophessoron ke dam par yah uniwarsity kaise chal rahi he
 Students are not getting professors, they are getting ruined, those who could have been professors are not getting jobs
 ve bhi barbaad ho rahe hai
 Similarly, 1099 posts have been left in non-teaching
 sarkaron ne bhartiyon band kar di hai
 The building of the college and university seems to be shining but all of them have turned into ruins
 aap in vishyon par kisi netaa ko bolte nahin dekhenge
 How will they tell, then they will have to tell why there are no teachers in these colleges and for how long
 akhir madhunabi, begusarai or darbhanga ke logon ne apane collejon kaa yah patan kaise sweekaar kiya
 Madhubani's RK College was formed in 1940
 sthaneey vyapaaree the, ramakrishna purve, unheen ke kaaran or unheen ke naam par ye college he
 The city must also have forgotten Ramakrishna Poorve, now everyone remembers RK College
 yahaan inter se lekar prost graduate ke 15,000 chaatr padhate hai
 You would not believe that there are only 30 professors for 15,000 students
 ek professor par 500 chaatr aaenge
 Isn't it funny kya ek shikshak 500 chaatro ko padhaa saktaa he? media dilli or dilli ke bhi teen chaar netaaon ke bayanon ke peeche bhaag rahaa he lekin kya ham soch rahe hai ki desh kahaan bhaag rahaa he
 Together 30 professors can teach 15,000 students
 is niyati ko madhubani zile ke logon ne sweekaar bhi kaise kar liya
 There is no teacher in Hindi, Urdu, Geography and History here
 yahi nahin ganit, jeev vigyaan or vanaspati vigyaan main ek ek teacher hai
 In these subjects, there is also no provision for keeping guest or contract teachers
 jis vishay ke shikshak nahin hai vahaan class nahin hoti he
 So is the college just the name of the system of taking admission
 principal se lekar professor kisi se baat kiijie, sab chup ho jate hai
 Nobody wants to come on camera
 ghabara kar koi bol hi nahin rahaa
 Meaning you can tell that colleges are running without teachers, which can be action
 karrwai karne vaale ko itnaa yakeen he ki shikshak bhale na ho magar uske khilaaf karrwai nahin hogi
 Should the state government not refund the admission fees to all the students instead of taking action
 yah apane aap main ghotaalaa he ki admician fees lijie or padhaane ke liye teacher mat rakhie
 Only the leader comes on camera and his spokesperson on the panel
 kai logon se baat kar pataa chalaa he ki 41 collejon main se 28-30 college main koi sthaayee principal nahin he
 All these colleges are running due to the charge
 ye us mithilanchal kaa haal he jahaan se na jane kitne professor, iees se lekar ipies bane honge
 Udaanacharya Rosda College is in Samastipur
 udayanacharya sanskrit ke bade mashhoor vidwaan hue
 This college is named after him
 1960 main ise banane ke liye ram vilaas purve or ram avatar purve ne zamin daan main di thi
 The college has been running since 1960 in an 11-acre campus
 iskaa kabir bhawan lagata he kabir par hi ro rahaa he
 The building will look like everything is fine, but there are only 8 professors to teach 1600 students
 yahaan 34 pad manzur hai lekin 26 pad khaali hai
 There is no professor in Hindi
 ganit main bhi ek hi professor he
 There is no professor in History Political Science, Geography, Sanskrit
 yakeen nahin hota ki yahaan ke chaatr kiskaa cheharaa dekhne college aate honge, kya is college main kabhi koi mantri nahin jate honge, koi saansad yaa vidhayak kaa kaarykram bhi nahin hota hoga
 How big of a deception did the students studying here, have they ever known
 hamane ek shikshak sangh ke sachiv se sawaal kiya ki mata pita to aate honge aap logon ke paas ki padhai nahin ho rahi he, chaatr bhi to aate honge
 He knew their answer but you might not know
 professor sahab ne kaha ki koi mata pita nahin aata he poochne ki unke bacchon ke saath kya ho rahaa he
 The students do not even come, they just live in such a situation that after three years they will get the degree
 bihar main ucch shiksha dhwast he
 This collapse of our consciousness in democracy is really worrying
 kya aapane sochaa he ki bagaiyr guru ke bharat vishwa guru kaise banegaa, kya apane noujvaan chaatro ko bevakoof banaakar bharat ko vishwa guru banaaya ja rahaa he, ye duniya kii ankhon main dhul jhonkne ke liye ho rahaa he yaa bharat ke naujavaanon kii ankhon main dhul jhonkne ke liye ho rahaa he
 You are looking at the building of Lalit Narayan Mithila University
 1972 main yah vishwavidwalay kaayam hua tha
 Operates 69 colleges in four districts
 darbhanga maharaj kii di gai zamin or imaarat main yah vishvavidhyalay chalanaa shuru kiya tha
 Here the class runs at little
 is vishvavidlaay kaa kaam sirf mukhya chaar kaam rah gaye hai
 Filling the form, getting admission, filling the examination form and publishing the result
 padhai iskaa kaam nahin he
 The session of this university is going on for a year
 teen saal ke bie riselt aane main chaar saal se adhik samay lag jaataa he
 There are various ways to manage it
 bie pratham varsh kaa riselt niklaa he
 Children passed without studies
 visi kehete hai ki jaldi hi inhen duusare varsh kaa farm bharne ke liye kaha jayega or duusare saal kii padhai ke bagair pariksha dilaa di jaaegi
 In this way, the session going back by one year will be regularized
 magar jo chaatr do saal teen saal bagair padhe paas honge unka jivan to hameshaa ke liye aniyamit ho jayega
 There are vacancies of teachers in these colleges but no guest or adhoc is allowed
 dilli vishvavidlaay main kam se kam edock ke sahare padhai kaa kaam chalata rahata he
 The Vice Chancellor informed that we are going to start the e-school so that the teacher shortage can be filled
 jo ritaryrd professor hai unhen padhaane ke liye rakhaa jayega
 But new talented youngsters will not be kept in vacant places
 bihar main is samay bahaali chal rahi he
 Like slow motion news
 zarurat se bahut kam shikshakon kii niyukti ho rahi he
 The university has received many teachers due to the recent resumption, but even after this, according to the budget paper of 2018-19, there are 1312 vacancies in Mithilanchal University
 si em science college darbhanga kaa pratishthit college he
 Naik has given it an a grade
 iske baad bhi 50 fisadi pad khaali hai
 There were supposed to be 106 professors, but only 27 professors are teaching here
 79 prophessoron kii kami he is college main
 3000 students study here
 iske baad bhi nack ne e grad diya he
 Can a college get an a grade without a teacher? kyon milanaa chahie
 Is this the a grade of India that there is no teacher to teach? si em science college ke principal ne kaha ki patna uniwarsity main bhi koi e grad college nahin he
 CM is Science College
 yahaan par class hoti he
 Its laboratory and library are quite good
 college main class band he
 The result is a glut of coaching centers outside the college
 bharat kii shiksha vyavastha inhen koching centre ke bharose chal rahi he
 Which do not come under any Human Resource Development Minister nor any University Grant Commission
 is board ko aap dekhie
 Deepavali's bumper blast is for tuition
 deepawali ke avasar par barahavin class ke commers ke liye 7000 kaa admician 1500 main mil rahaa he
 Tution also has AC and non-ac categories
 non asi class room sasta hota he
 The fees for a subject range from 4500 to 6000
 asi class room main ek vishay ke liye 7 se 8000 tution fees he
 Students from weaker economic classes attend these universities
 un par sarkarein do prakaar kaa boj daalati hai
 First, the teacher does not pay the fees from them
 phir baahar jaakar tution fees dene ke liye majaboor karti hai
 At a glance, the education government of India is running, but look closely, the poor parents are carrying the burden of India's education system
 badale main unhen shiksha kii jagah bacchon kii barbaadi mil rahi he
 This has been happening for twenty years

 How many people donated land with great pride, donated property but all have turned into colorful ruins
 rangepute khandhar isliye kaha kyonki deveopment fees or milane vaale anya fund se bahut se college chamakate nazar aate hai
 There is a renowned girls' college in Begusarai, Bihar
 nami kis liye he pataa nahin magar yahaan saadhe das hazaar ladkiyaan padhati hai
 The comments shri krishna mahila college nack kii grading ke anusaar bi grad college he
 The National Accreditation Council does grading of colleges
 is bi grad college main saadhe das hazaar ladkiyaan padhati hai or begusarai zile kaa yah ek maatr sarkari mahila college he
 In 1958, this college was built by Biseshwar Prasad Singh and Saryu Prasad Singh
 apni zamin daan main di
 Saryu Singh was an MLA and also a freedom fighter
 kis hisaab se saadhe das hazaar chaatraon ke liye profasaron ke tees pad manzur hai, pad manzur karne vaale ne zarur ganit main fail hone kaa badla liya hoga
 Yet only 9 out of 30 professors are here
 jahaan saadhe das hazaar main 9 se bhaag kiijie to pataa chalegaa ki ek professor par 1200 bacchon kii zimmedaari he
 Can a professor teach 1200 girls? sanskrit, urdu, chemistry, botni main shikshak nahin hai
 Girls are free to study in Bihar
 admician ke liye koi fees nahin lagati he
 There are no professors in the class either
 rajya sarkaar ne do bajet satr se college ko paisa nahin diya he
 Electricity and Internet bills have not been given
 computer or anya kaam ke liye dihadi par log rakhe jate hai magar fund ke abhaav main college wo bhi nahin rakh paa rahaa he
 This is the condition of Digital India
 chaatro ko professor nahin mil rahe hai, ve barbaad ho rahe hai, jo professor ho sakate the unhen naukari nahin mil rahi he
 They are also being ruined
 isi tarah non teaching main bhi 1099 pad khaali hai
 Governments have stopped hiring
 college or uniwarsity kii imaarat hi chamakati nazar aa rahi he magar sabake sab khandhar main badal gaye hai
 You will not see any leader speaking on these subjects
 kaise bonlege, phir unhen bataanaa padegaa ki in collejon main shikshak kyon nahin hai ou kab tak honge
 After all, how did the people of Madhunbi, Begusarai and Darbhanga accept this decline of their colleges
 1940 main bana tha, madhubani kaa aar ke college
 Ramakrishna Poorve was a local businessman, because of him and this college is named after him
 shahar ne bhi ramakrishna purve ko bhula diya hoga, ab sabko aar ke college hi yaad rahaa hoga
 It has 15,000 students from Inter to Prost Graduates
 aap yakeen nahin karenge ki 15000 chaatro ke liye yahaan maatr 30 professor hai
 a professor will have 500 students
 kya yah mazaaq nahin chal rahaa he
 Can a teacher teach 500 students? The media is running behind the statements of three or four leaders of Delhi and Delhi but are we wondering where the country is running
 30 professor milakar kya 15000 chaatro ko padhaa sakate hai
 How did the people of Madhubani district accept this fate
 yahaan hindi, urdu, bhugol or itihaas main koi shikshak hi nahin he
 Not only this, there are teachers in mathematics, biology and botany
 in vishyon main guest yaa theke par shikshak rakhane kii bhi vyavastha nahin he
 There is no class in the subject for which there are no teachers
 to kya college sirf admician lene bhar kii vyavastha kaa naam he
 Talk to anyone, from the principal to the professor, everyone goes silent
 koi camere par nahin aana chahta he
 Nobody is speaking with fear
 matlab aap yah bataa den ki college bina shikshakon ke chal rahe hai jo karrwai ho sakati he
 The actioner is so sure that even if the teacher is not there, action will not be taken against him
 karrwai kii jagah kya rajya sarkaar ko saare chaatro ko admician fees waapas nahin karnaa chahie
 It is a scam in itself to collect admission fees and do not hire a teacher to teach
 camere par sirf netaa aate hai or panel main unke pravaktaa
 Talking to many people, it is learned that out of 41 colleges, 28-30 colleges have no permanent principal
 prabharee ke badaulat ye saare college chal rahe hai
 This is the situation in Mithilanchal, from where no one knows how many professors, from IAS to IPS
 samastipur main udayanacharya rosda college he
 Udayanacharya became a very famous scholar of Sanskrit
 unheen ke naam par yah college he
 It was donated by Ram Vilas Purve and Ram Avatar Purve in 1960 to build it
 11 acre ke campes main yah college 1960 se chal rahaa he
 Its Kabir Bhavan seems to be crying on Kabir itself
 imaarat dekhakar lagegaa ki sab thik hi he magar yahaan ke 1600 chaatro ko padhaane ke liye maatr 8 professor hai
 Here 34 posts are approved but 26 posts are vacant
 hindi main to koi professor hi nahin he
 There is only one professor in mathematics
 itihaas polytical science, bhugol, sanskrit main koi professor nahin he
 It is not sure whose students will come to the college to see its face, will there never be a minister in this college, there will not be any MP or MLA program
 yahaan padhane vaale chaatro ke saath kitna bada chal hua, kya unhen kabhi pataa chalaa hoga
 We questioned the secretary of a teachers union that parents would be coming, you are not having education, students would also come
 unka jawaab jaanata tha magar aap shaayad nahin jaanate honge
 Professor Sahab said that no parents come to ask what is happening to their children
 chaatr bhi nahin aate hai, ve bas isi firaaq main rahete hai ki teen saal baad degree to mil jaaegi
 Higher education in Bihar is dismantled
 loktantr main hamaari chetana kaa yah patan vaaki chintajanak he
 Have you thought about how India will become a world guru without a guru, is India being made a world guru by fooling its young students, is it going to throw dust in the eyes of the world or dust in the eyes of the youth of India? Is going to blow lalit narayan mithila vishvavidlaay kii imaarat aap dekh rahe hai
 This University was established in 1972
 chaar zilon ke 69 kalege kaa sanchaalan karata he
 This university started running in the land and building given by Darbhanga Maharaj
 yahaan class na ke baraabar chalati he
 The work of this university remains only the main four
 farm bharna, admician karana, pariksha kaa farm bharaana or riselt prakashit karnaa
 Studying is not its job
 is uniwarsity kaa seshan ek saal let chal rahaa he
 It takes more than four years to get a three-year BA result
 ise manage karne ke liye tarah tarah kaa tarika nikaala jaataa he
 BA first year result is out
 bina padhai ke bachche paas hue
 VC says that soon they will be asked to fill the second year form and the examination will be conducted without studying for the second year
 is tarah se ek saal se peeche chal rahe seshan ko niyamit kar diya jayega
 But students who pass two years, three years without studying, their life will be irregular forever
 in collejon main shikshakon ke pad khaali hai magar guest yaa edock rakhane kii anumati nahin he
 In Delhi University, at least the work of studies continues with the help of adhoc
 vaais chancelar ne bataaya ki i paathshaala shuru karne ja rahe hai taaki shikshak kii kami puri kii ja sake
 Retired professors who are professors will be hired to teach
 magar khaali jagahon par nae pratibhashali naujavaanon ko nahin rakhaa jayega
 Restoration is currently underway in Bihar
 dhimi gati ke samachar kii tarah
 Very few teachers are being appointed out of necessity
 haal kii bahaali se uniwarsity ko kai shikshak mili hai lekin iske baad bhi 2018-19 ke bajet patr ke anusaar mithilanchal vishvavidlaay main 1312 pad khaali hai
 CM Science College is a prestigious college of Darbhanga
 ise nack ne e grad diya he
 Even after this, 50 percent posts are vacant
 106 professor hone chahie the, lekin yahaan maatr 27 professor hi padhaa rahe hai
 There is a shortage of 79 professors in this college
 yahaan 3000 chaatr padhate hai
 Even after this, Naik has given a grade
 bagair shikshak ke kya kisi college ko e grad mil saktaa he
 Why should we get it
 kya yahi bharat kaa e grad he ki padhaane ke liye teacher nahin he
 Principal of CM Science College said that there is no a grade college even in Patna University
 si em science college he
 There is a class here
 isaki prayogshaala or librari kaaphi acchhee he
 Class is closed in college
 nateeja college ke baahar koching centre kii bharmaar ho gai he
 India's education system is running on the strength of these coaching centers
 jo na kisi maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri ke antargat aate hai or na kisi uniwarsity grant kamishan ke
 Look at this board
 deepawali kaa banpar dhamaakaa he tution ke liye
 On the occasion of Deepawali, the admission of 7000 for the 12th class commerce is getting 1500
 tution ke bhi asi or non asi catagori hai
 Non AC class rooms are cheaper
 ek vishay kii fees 4500 se 6000 hoti he
 There are 7 to 8000 tuition fees for one subject in an AC class room
 in vishvavidhyalayon main kamazor aarthik varg ke chaatr padhate hai
 Governments place two types of burden on them
 pehle unase fees lekar teacher nahin detii hai
 Then go out and force them to pay tuition fees
 ek nazar main lagegaa ki bharat kii shiksha sarkaar chalaa rahi he, magar gaur se dekhie to garib maa baap bharat kii shiksha vyavastha kaa bhaar dho rahe hai
 In return, they are getting wastage of children instead of education
 bees saal se yah sab ho rahaa he
 Colleges built in village village towns towns have been abolished
 kitne logon ne bade armaan se zaminein daan deen, sampatti daan di magar sab rangepute khandhar main badal gaye hai
 Rangepute ruins said because many colleges are shining with development fees and other funds available
 bihar ke begusarai main ladakiyon kaa ek nami college he
 i don't know what the name is for, but ten and a half thousand girls study here
 tippaniyan Sri Krishna Mahila College is a b grade college as per the grading of NAC
 neshnal acridation coucil collejon kii grading karti he
 This b grade college teaches 10,000 girls and it is the only government women's college in Begusarai district
 1958 main is college ko biseshwar prasad singh or sarayu prasad singh ne banwaaya tha
 Donated his land
 sarayu singh vidhayak the or swatantraaa senaanee bhi
 According to which thirty posts of professors are allowed for ten and a half thousand girls, those who have sanctioned the posts must have avenged their failure in mathematics
 phir bhi 30 main se 9 hi professor hai yahaan
 If you divide 9 out of ten and a half thousand, then you will find that a professor is responsible for 1200 children
 kya 1200 ladakiyon ko ek professor padhaa sakati hai
 There are no teachers in Sanskrit, Urdu, Chemistry, Botany
 bihar main ladakiyon kii padhai muft he
 There are no fees for admission
 class main bhi professor nahin hai
 The state government has not given money to the college for two budget sessions
 bijli or internet kaa bill tak nahin diya ja sakaa he
 People are hired on daily basis for computer and other work, but due to lack of funds, the college is unable to keep it either
 ye haal he digital india kaa
 Madhubani's RK College was formed in 1940
 sthaneey vyapaaree the, ramakrishna purve, unheen ke kaaran or unheen ke naam par ye college he
 The city must also have forgotten Ramakrishna Poorve, now everyone remembers RK College
 yahaan inter se lekar prost graduate ke 15,000 chaatr padhate hai
 You would not believe that there are only 30 professors for 15,000 students
 ek professor par 500 chaatr aaenge
 Isn't it funny kya ek shikshak 500 chaatro ko padhaa saktaa he? media dilli or dilli ke bhi teen chaar netaaon ke bayanon ke peeche bhaag rahaa he lekin kya ham soch rahe hai ki desh kahaan bhaag rahaa he
 Together 30 professors can teach 15,000 students
 is niyati ko madhubani zile ke logon ne sweekaar bhi kaise kar liya
 There is no teacher in Hindi, Urdu, Geography and History here
 yahi nahin ganit, jeev vigyaan or vanaspati vigyaan main ek ek teacher hai
 In these subjects, there is also no provision for keeping guest or contract teachers
 jis vishay ke shikshak nahin hai vahaan class nahin hoti he
 So is the college just the name of the system of taking admission
 principal se lekar professor kisi se baat kiijie, sab chup ho jate hai
 Nobody wants to come on camera
 ghabara kar koi bol hi nahin rahaa
 Meaning you can tell that colleges are running without teachers, which can be action
 karrwai karne vaale ko itnaa yakeen he ki shikshak bhale na ho magar uske khilaaf karrwai nahin hogi
 Should the state government not refund the admission fees to all the students instead of taking action
 yah apane aap main ghotaalaa he ki admician fees lijie or padhaane ke liye teacher mat rakhie
 Only the leader comes on camera and his spokesperson on the panel
 kai logon se baat kar pataa chalaa he ki 41 collejon main se 28-30 college main koi sthaayee principal nahin he
 All these colleges are running due to the charge
 ye us mithilanchal kaa haal he jahaan se na jane kitne professor, iees se lekar ipies bane honge
 Udaanacharya Rosda College is in Samastipur
 udayanacharya sanskrit ke bade mashhoor vidwaan hue
 This college is named after him
 1960 main ise banane ke liye ram vilaas purve or ram avatar purve ne zamin daan main di thi
 The college has been running since 1960 in an 11-acre campus
 iskaa kabir bhawan lagata he kabir par hi ro rahaa he
 The building will look like everything is fine, but there are only 8 professors to teach 1600 students
 yahaan 34 pad manzur hai lekin 26 pad khaali hai
 There is no professor in Hindi
 ganit main bhi ek hi professor he
 There is no professor in History Political Science, Geography, Sanskrit
 yakeen nahin hota ki yahaan ke chaatr kiskaa cheharaa dekhne college aate honge, kya is college main kabhi koi mantri nahin jate honge, koi saansad yaa vidhayak kaa kaarykram bhi nahin hota hoga
 How big of a deception did the students studying here, have they ever known
 hamane ek shikshak sangh ke sachiv se sawaal kiya ki mata pita to aate honge aap logon ke paas ki padhai nahin ho rahi he, chaatr bhi to aate honge
 He knew their answer but you might not know
 professor sahab ne kaha ki koi mata pita nahin aata he poochne ki unke bacchon ke saath kya ho rahaa he
 The students do not even come, they just live in such a situation that after three years they will get the degree
 bihar main ucch shiksha dhwast he
 This collapse of our consciousness in democracy is really worrying
 kya aapane sochaa he ki bagaiyr guru ke bharat vishwa guru kaise banegaa, kya apane noujvaan chaatro ko bevakoof banaakar bharat ko vishwa guru banaaya ja rahaa he, ye duniya kii ankhon main dhul jhonkne ke liye ho rahaa he yaa bharat ke naujavaanon kii ankhon main dhul jhonkne ke liye ho rahaa he
 You are looking at the building of Lalit Narayan Mithila University
 1972 main yah vishwavidwalay kaayam hua tha
 Operates 69 colleges in four districts
 darbhanga maharaj kii di gai zamin or imaarat main yah vishvavidhyalay chalanaa shuru kiya tha

 Filling the form, getting admission, filling the examination form and publishing the result
 padhai iskaa kaam nahin he
 The session of this university is going on for a year
 teen saal ke bie riselt aane main chaar saal se adhik samay lag jaataa he
 There are various ways to manage it

 Children passed without studies
 visi kehete hai ki jaldi hi inhen duusare varsh kaa farm bharne ke liye kaha jayega or duusare saal kii padhai ke bagair pariksha dilaa di jaaegi
 In this way, the session going back by one year will be regularized
 magar jo chaatr do saal teen saal bagair padhe paas honge unka jivan to hameshaa ke liye aniyamit ho jayega
 There are vacancies of teachers in these colleges but no guest or adhoc is allowed
 dilli vishvavidlaay main kam se kam edock ke sahare padhai kaa kaam chalata rahata he
 The Vice Chancellor informed that we are going to start the e-school so that the teacher shortage can be filled
 jo ritaryrd professor hai unhen padhaane ke liye rakhaa jayega
 But new talented youngsters will not be kept in vacant places
 bihar main is samay bahaali chal rahi he
 Like slow motion news
 zarurat se bahut kam shikshakon kii niyukti ho rahi he
 The university has received many teachers due to the recent resumption, but even after this, according to the budget paper of 2018-19, there are 1312 vacancies in Mithilanchal University

 1972 main yah vishwavidwalay kaayam hua tha
 Operates 69 colleges in four districts
 darbhanga maharaj kii di gai zamin or imaarat main yah vishvavidhyalay chalanaa shuru kiya tha
 Here the class runs at little

 Filling the form, getting admission, filling the examination form and publishing the result

 Children passed without studies
 visi kehete hai ki jaldi hi inhen duusare varsh kaa farm bharne ke liye kaha jayega or duusare saal kii padhai ke bagair pariksha dilaa di jaaegi
 In this way, the session going back by one year will be regularized
 magar jo chaatr do saal teen saal bagair padhe paas honge unka jivan to hameshaa ke liye aniyamit ho jayega
 There are vacancies of teachers in these colleges but no guest or adhoc is allowed

 CM is Science College

 BJP leaders have said that in the event of formation of government in Maharashtra, BJP should have CM in the state
 itnaa hi nahin rajya main party akele apane dam par chunaav lade
 Local BJP leaders have alleged that Shiv Sena always plays the role of elder brother in the state
 bijepi ko niyantrit karne kii koshish karti he
 The leaders have demanded that the Shiv Sena's actions no longer need to be tolerated
 party ne shivasena par aarope lagaaya he ki loksabhaa chunaav main mili jabardast safalataa kaa shrey narendra modi ko nahin diya gaya
 Local BJP leaders have also accused the Shiv Sena leaders of humiliating them
 aantarik baithak main shivasena ko lekar naaraazgiloksabhaa chunaav main shandaar pradarshan se utsahit maharashtra bijepi ke kai padaadhikariyon ne kaha ki party ko is varsh ke ant tak hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main gathbandhan saajhedaar shivasena ko kam mahatv nahin diya janaa chahie
 Maharashtra BJP chief Devendra Fadnavis told party workers at a meeting in Mumbai that Shiv Sena's grievances would be resolved on a suitable platform
 unhone kaha, ‘shivasena hamaara achche samay ke saath hi mushkil daur kaa bhi saathi rahaa he
 Just because our party has done well in the Lok Sabha elections, it would not be right to call for breaking the alliance
 ’ unhone yah baat kuch netaaon ke bhaashanon ke jawaab main kahi jinhone kaha ki shivasena ne gat 25 saalon ke dauraan bhaajapa ke rajya main badhane nahin diya
 Senior BJP leader Madhu Chavan said, 'shiv Sena (traditionally) fielded candidates for 174 seats and BJP for only 114 seats (in assembly elections)
 yah antar bahut adhik he or hamaari party ko samaan hissedari milani chahie
 'some speakers wanted the party to break the alliance
 bhaajapa ke ek netaa ne kaha, ‘hamen kamatar karke mat ankiye
 The party leadership should repose faith in the workers and contest all 288 seats and we will create history
 ’ Both Rohit and Rahane may get a chance when landing with 4 bowlers, the Indian team management is in a dilemma to prepare a combination for the first Test match against West Indies
 
 paanch visheshgy gendbaajon ke saath utarane kii dasha main rohit sharma or ajinkya rahane main se kiskaa chayan karnaa he yah abhi tay nahin hua he
 The first Test of the two-test series will be played from 22 to 26 August at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium (north Sound, Antiga)
 yah donon tiimon kaa vishwa test championships ke tahat pehla muqabla hoga
 If Team India follows the strategy of landing with four bowlers, then both Rohit and Rahane can get a place in the playing XI
 agar aisa nahin hota he to phir in donon main se kisi ek ko baahar baithna hoga or maujuuda form ko dekhte hue rahane kaa chayan mushkil lag rahaa he
 After seven and a half months, India will come out to play in the long-term format and the biggest question about the final XI is that Virat Kohli and Ravi Shastri get off with an extra sixth batsman or extra bowler for the first Test match starting on Thursday
 Whether or not agar bhartiya team prabandhan paramparaagat ranneeti se chalata he to keel rahul or mayank agarwal ko pari kaa aagaaj karnaa chahie, lekin yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki rahul ko australia ke khilaaf antim do test maichon ke liye team main nahin chunaa gaya tha or hanuma vihari ne pari kii shuruyaat kii thi
 IND vs WI: Just one win
 
 
 or captain kohli kar lenge dhoni kii barabarivihari ne haalanki zyada ran nahin banaae, lekin unhone gend kii chamak utaarne main ahm bhoomika nibhaai, jiskaa agarwal or cheteshwar pujaara ko phayda mila
 If Rahul's poor Test record of last year is kept in mind, Vihari can start the innings again
 pujaara or kohli tisare or chauthe number par do majboot stambh hai, lekin samasya uske baad shuru hoti he
 Wicketkeeper batsman Rishabh Pant can land at number six and in the absence of Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja can come at number seven to balance the team
 aise main kohli ko rohit or rahane main se kisi ek kaa hi chayan karnaa hoga
 Rohit scored an unbeaten half-century in his final Test innings and he also batted well in the first innings of the practice match
 rahane ne duusari pari main ran banaae, lekin vah achche form main nahin hai or yahaan tak ki hampshire ke liye county cricket main khelte hue bhi unka aatmavishvaas nahin bad paaya
 These two can be included in the XI only on the strategy of landing with four bowlers
 aise main teen tej gendbaaj jasprit bumraah, mohammad shami or eshanth sharma tathaa ravichandran aswin yaa kuldeep yadav ke rup main ekmaatr spinner ko team main rakhaa jayega
 Placing extra batsmen means Jadeja will not get a chance
 captain kohli hameshaa paanch gendbaajon ko utaarne ke pakshdhar rahe hai, kyonki test match jeetne ke liye 20 wicket lene jaruri hote hai
 Umesh Yadav can also be included in the team if the pitch is suited to fast bowlers
 bhugarbhashastra kii ek vishesh shakha, jisamen bukampo kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he, seismology kehalaata he
 There are three types of tremors
 (1) praathmik tarang:yah tarang prithvi ke andar prayek madhyam se hokar guzarati he
 Its average velocity is 8 km per second
 yah gati sabhi tarango se adhik hoti he
 Due to which these waves reach the first place at any place
 (2) dwitiya tarang:inhen anuprastha tarange bhi kehete hai
 This wave only passes through the solid medium
 iskaa ausat veg 4 kimiprati second hota he
 (3) L-waves: They are also called as surface or long waves

 D
 Love ne kii thi
 They are also sometimes called as love waves

 These waves are confined to the ground
 ye thos, taral or gas teenon madhyamon main guzar sakati he
 Its velocity is 1
 5-3 kimi prati second he
 Seismic waves are underlined by a device called Seismograph

 (b) Only the primary waves can pass through the central part of the earth but their velocity decreases there
 (c)gaun tarange drav padaarth main se nahin guzar saktin
 (d) L-waves move only near the ground
 (e)vibhinn madhyamon main se guzarate samay ye tarange paravartit or apavartit hoti hai
 The origin of the earthquake is called its epicenter
 bukamp ke centre ke paas P,S or l teenon prakaar kii tarange pahunchati hai
 In the inner parts of the earth, these waves change their path and travel inward on a concave path
 bukamp centre se dharaatal ke saath 11000 kimi kii duuri tak p or s tarange pahunchati hai
 On reaching the central part, the s waves disappear and the p waves are refracted
 isaki vajah se bukamp ke centre se 11000 kimi ke baad lagbhag 5000 kimi tak koi bhi tarang nahin pahunchati he
 This zone is called the Shadow Zone
 bukamp kaa adhikendre (epicentre)bukamp ke centre ke thik upar prithvi kii sataha par sthit bindu ko bukamp kaa adhikendre kehete hai
 The sensitive instruments by which the intensity of seismic waves are measured are called seismographs
 iske teen scale hai:(i)rociferal scale(ii)markeli scale(iii)richter scalerictor scale (richter Scale)bukamp kii tivrata maapne vaale richter scale kaa vikaas america vaigyanik charles richter ne 1935 main kiya tha
 Each next unit on the Richter scale has 10 times more intensity than the previous unit
 is scale par 2
 0 or 3
 0 kii tivrata kaa bukamp halkaa hota he, jabaki 6
 a magnitude of 2 means a powerful earthquake

 jiske baad somvaar ko engiti main chif secretary or dilli jal board ke siio pesh hue
 Jal Board CEO Keshav Chandra told the NGT that the Executive Board of Jal Board is not allowing me to follow your order

 The chairman of the Delhi Jal Board is himself Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 engiti jal board ke siio ke bayaan par bhadak gaya or kaha jis kaam ko 2019 main puraa karnaa he
 It has not even been started yet
 court ne poocha kyon na dilli jal board or dilli sarkaar ke bank khaaton ko jabt kar liya jaae
 The NGT issued a show cause notice to the Delhi government and the Jal Board and asked them to file a reply within 10 hours
 agar 14 sivej treetment plant sahi samay par chaalu ho jate hai to yamuna kaa 67 fisadi pradooshan kam ho jayega
 Yamuna was to be cleaned in a total of 2 phases
 pehle phej main 14 sivej treetment plan lagaana tha or 2019 tak puraa karnaa tha
 Now it has to be seen what the Delhi Government and the Water Board say in response to the show cause notice after 10 days

 Fish are on the trees Author: Pratibha Chauhan Prakash: Bodhi Prakashan, Jaipur Price: Rs 125
 desh, samaaj, bhashaa ke prati gahari samvednaaon vaala kavita sangraipane pehle hi kavy sangrah pedo par hai machhliyaan main pratibha chouhan ne jis paripakvata kaa parichay diya he, vah bahut kam dekhne ko miltaa he
 There are two extreme trends in Hindi poetry here
 ek taraf, kavita ko lagbhag abujh bana diya ja rahaa he to duusari taraf kavita ke naam par yatharth kii sthool abhivyakti ho rahi he
 Pratibha has made her own poetic path between these two extremisms
 sampreshniyata se samjhauta kiye bina yatharth ko kalatmak tareeke se abhivyakti kar dena unki viral visheshta he
 The earliest poems of women often contain a plurality of personal experiences
 is kaaran unki kavitaaon kii vishay-vastu atyant simit hone ke saath hi ekares bhi ho jaati hai
 There is a lot of thematic expansion of talent
 unki kavitaaon main stri kii nijee anubhuti kii jagah desh, samaaj, raashtra, paryaavaran, visthaapan, bhashaa aadi kii chintaa adhik he
 This uniqueness is his real strength
 visthaapan kaa dard main ve jahaan visthapit manushya kii pidaa or hataasha ko abhivyakti karti hai to jajba main manushya or prakruti ke bich ke ekatarfa rishte ko—usamen baantne kaa jajba tha / or aadmi main lene kaa
 There are also some good love poems in this collection
 in kavitaaon main samarpan kaa bhav adhik mukherit hua he
 In many places, the sublime of erasing its existence
 baavjood iske, kavitaaon main bhavukta kii jagah bauddhikta kaa sansparsh he
 Images and symbols are best used
 bhavapaksh ke saath rup paksh bhi utana hi sundar he
 -dinesh Kumar kya aap tiger ke papa bananaa chaahate he? ji haa, yadi aapako jaanwaron se pyaar he, unke liye kuch karnaa chaahate hai, to aap ranchi ke birsa jaivik udyaan (ju) aa sakate hai
 Animals can be adopted here
 unke abhibhavak ban sakate hai
 To reduce the cost of maintenance of animals, Zoo Management has given this attractive offer to the people
 ju management logon ko iske prati jaagruk karne ke liebollywood abhinetri priyanka chopdake baad bhartiya cricket team ke captain mahendra singh dhoni ko bhi is muhim main jodna chahta he
 It has been trying for the last two years, but has not been successful yet
 lekin ju menagement ko lagata he ki is baar dhoni jaanwaron ke liye aage aaenge or unhen god lenge
 According to Zoo director AK Patra, the expense of animal care in Zoo is very high
 isliye hamane yah yojana shuru kii he ki log jaanwaron ko god le sakate hai
 For this we are also working on a plan to add some big celebrities
 pichley saal main priyanka chopra ne sundari or durga naam kii do sherni ko god liya tha
 His mother has been here many times with her relatives
 jharkhand sarkaaraki is muhim se ju ghumne aane vaale darshak bhi kaaphi khush hai
 He says that this initiative of the government will benefit the animals on the one hand, while the common man will get the opportunity to do something for the animals directly for the first time

 'lockheed Martin has made no such comments

 Marathi manush and Hindi speaking, there was bound to be ruckus
 gujarat daure ke pehle din raaj thakare ne hindi boli to maharashtra main siyaasi paara chadh gaya
 Raj Thackeray was attacked daily
 narendra modi ke sarkari mehmaan banakar gujarat pahunche emenes ke mukhiya raaj thakare to jubaan badal gai
 See what Raj Thackeray said on Gujarat tour
 Often Marathi speaking firebrand leaders started speaking Hindi in Modi's state and targeted those in Hindi who are trying to rule on his tour
 raaj thakare ne kaha, 'kisi state kaa deveopment dekhnaa rajaniti nahin hoti he, jo log aisa sochate hai unki soch kaaphi choti hoti he
 But Raj Thackeray's visit to Gujarat did not create panic; however, questions were raised in the politics of Maharashtra when he spoke Hindi in Gujarat
 maharashtra vidhansabha main bavaal hua or shivasena ko marathi mudde par ekadhikaar jataane kaa mauka mil gaya
 The Congress also quickly quipped on Raj's Hindi language
 raaj thakare kii hindi sunakar samaajawaadee party ke netaa abu azmi ko wo din yaad aayaa jab samaajawaadee vidhayakon ke hindi main shapath lene par raaj thakare ke vidhayakon ne hangaamaa khadaa kiya tha
 Therefore, Abu Azmi immediately attacked
 jab siyaasi hamalon kii khabar raaj thakare tak pahunchi to unhone palatwaar marathi main hi kiya
 Raj Thackeray is on a nine-day Gujarat tour and has eight days left

 The Oxford Dictionary chose the term after conducting a poll
 vahiin merian-webster ne 'science' (science) ko is saal kaa sabase lokapriy shabd chunaa
 But if we choose the most popular desi word (jargon) of this year, what can it be? If the matter is polled in India, then Kapil Sharma's 'baba Ji Thullu' will reach the top
 'baba ji kaa thullu' bolnaa aajkal logon ko bada kool lagane laga he
 Kapil Sharma, the host of 'comedy Nights with Kapil', started using it in his show and upon seeing it 'baba Ji Ka Thullu' spread throughout the country
 kapil ke sho main aane vaale superstar hon yaa college jane vaale yangsters sabaki jubaan par is saal 'baba ji kaa thullu' chaaya rahaa
 Now you can gauge the popularity of this jargon from the fact that the bosses of the MNC company also hold their staff meeting 'baba Ji
 
 
 ' kaa jamkar istemaal karne lage hai
 What does 'baba Ji Ka Thullu' mean? 
 
 agar aapako kadi mehnat ke baad bhi kuch acha rigelt na mili or aapaki mehnat bekaar jaae to aap is jargon kaa istemaal kuch is tarah kar sakate hai
 
 
 Did you get even after doing so much! 'baba Ji's Thullu'

 desh bhar main is samay CAA or NRC ko lekar koharaam machaa hua he
 While the Modi government and its supporters are welcoming it as a historic step, the opposition, Muslim organizations and students in many camps are opposing it
 aaie jaanate hai ki CAA he kya (what is CAA) or CAA or CAB main kya antar he (difference between CAA and cab)?kya he naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon (caa)naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon yani CAA kaa phul form Citizenship Amendment Act he
 This was the CAB (citizenship Amendment Bill) before it was passed in Parliament
 Difference between CAA and CAB kii baat karen to sansad main paas hone or raashtrapati kii muhar lagane ke baad ye bill naagarik sanshodhan kanoon (CAA, Citizenship Amendment Act) yani act ban gaya he
 Citizens of India will be given to Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis, Jains and Buddhists who fled there due to religious persecution in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh with the help of Citizenship Amendment Act
 isliye ho rahaa desh bhar main virohis act kii madad se pakistan, afghanistan, bangladesh se aae hindu, isai, sikh, parsi, jain or buddha dharm ke logon ko bharat kii naagarikta di jaaegi
 But this act does not include people of Islam
 naagarikta sanshodhan bill ke kanoon banane ke baad ab pakistan, afghanistan, bangladesh ke hindu, isai, sikh, parsi, jain or buddha dharm ke wo log jinhone 31 disambar 2014 tak bharat main pravesh kar liya tha
 All of them will be able to apply for citizenship of India
 is kanoon ke virodhiyon kaa kahana he ki isamen sirf gaiyr muslim logon ko naagarikta dene kii baat kahi gai he, isliye ye dharmik bhedbhaav vaala kanoon he jo ki samvidhan ke anuchhed 14 kaa ulanghan he
 What happened in the Supreme Court on CAA (supreme Court on CAA) The court took cognizance of all the 59 petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019
 court ne naagarikta kanoon par ste lagane se saaf taur par manaa kar diya he
 The court has issued a notice to the central government
 ab maamle kii sunwaayee 22 janvari 2020 ko hogi
 With the help of Citizenship Amendment Act, now those of Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis, Jains and Buddhists of Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh who entered India by the decisive date of 31 December 2014
 ve sabhi bharat kii naagarikta ke paatr honge
 Has CAB become a Law? CAB means Citizenship Amendment Bill has now become law after passing the President's seal in Parliament
 Why does the Act leave Muslims out?grahamantri amit shah kaa kahana he ki afghanistan, pakistan or bangladesh muslim desh hai
 There, Muslims are not oppressed in the name of religion, so they are not included in this act
 cat-of kii taarikh kya he?-naagarikta ke liye cat-of kii date 31 disambar 2014 rakhi gai he
 -who are the people out of the CAA? -the law excludes the tribal areas of Assam and Meghalaya, Mizoram or Tripura besides Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Nagaland
 -kya bharat kii bangladesh, afghanistan or pakistan ke saath prayaavartan sandhi he?-prayaavartan kisi ko waapas bhejne yaa kisi ko unke mul sthaan par waapas bhejne kii prakriya he
 Once the government determines the nationality of illegal migrants (according to the Act), ideally they should be sent back to their country of origin
 haalanki bharat kii bangladesh, pakistan or afghanistan se aisi koi sandhi nahin he
 - Who are illegal migrants according to the Citizenship Act, 1955? Are migrants
 -nae kanoon ke mutabik avaidh pravasi koun hai?-afghanistan, bangladesh yaa pakistan se aane vaale sabhi hindu, sikh, buddha, jain, parsi yaa isai jo disambar 2014 se pehle bharat main pravesh kar chuke hai, unhen avaidh pravasi nahin mana jayega
 Apart from them, people entering India without valid passports or travel documents or those entering with valid documents who have not returned even after the sanctioned period are all illegal migrants
 -is kanoon ke khilaaf pradarshan kyon ho rahaa he?-virodhiyon ko kahana he ki ye kanoon samvidhan kii mul bhaavana or secularism ke khilaaf he
 In this law, illegal migrants living in the country are being distributed on religious grounds
 ye desh main avaidh rup se rah rahe chah dharmon ke logon ko to sharnaarthi maanakar naagarikta dene kii baat karata he lekin aise muslimon ko ghuspaithiya bataata he
 This law is also being described as preparation for NRC
 bhavishya main enarasi laane par sirf muslimon ko hi apni naagarikta sabit kerani hogi jabaki baaki chah dharmon ko isse chhot milegi
 Those Muslims who will not be able to prove citizenship of India will be kept in the Detention Center on the lines of Assam

 President Barack Obama has turned to Senate leaders to find a solution at the last moment, amid a week-long debate to protect the world's largest economy from the prospect of a 'fiscal cliff'
 'phiscal cliff' se bachane ke liye yadi samjhauta nahin ho paaya, to agle saal kii shuruyaat se hi swat: kar vruddhi or kharch main katautee kii vyavastha lagu ho jaaegi or iske kaaran america phir se mandi kaa shikaar ho saktaa he
 After a political conference in the White House on Friday, the responsibility of reaching an agreement to save the country from the fiscal cliff has been left to Senate leaders
 ucch-stareey baithak ke baad obama ne kaha ki unhen ummid he ki netaa kisi samjhaute par pahunchane main kaamyaab honge
 He also cautioned that the agreement would not be 100 percent favorable for either party
 omaba ne kaha ki kisi samjhaute kii anupasthiti main is mudde par matdaan hona chahie
 According to Obama's plan, there should be no increase in tax for America's middle class
 unhone un logon ko madhya varg kaha, jinaki paariwarik aay 2,50,000 dollar he
 According to Obama, tax increases may be allowed for those above family income
 tippaniyan Harry Reid, the majority leader of the Democrats in the Senate, told reporters Friday that the next 24 hours were extremely important in terms of the deal
 republican netaa seenetter mitch macconil ne ummid jataai ki ravivaar tak unke or read ke bich samjhauta ho jayega
 The most contentious issue in this case is the tax cuts, which came into force during the tenure of former President George Bush

 If a compromise is not reached to avoid the 'fiscal cliff', then by the beginning of next year, the system of automatic tax increase and spending cuts will be implemented and due to this the US may again fall into recession

 He said, 'he (laxman Singh) has his own personality and politics

 unhone kaha, 'hamen har saal tarriff tay karnaa hoga
 Many state governments have not changed electricity rates for years

 For years, questions have been raised about the poor financial condition of the distribution companies of the states
 ab sarkaar ne bel out package ke jariye in companiyon par karj kaa boj kam karne ke liye yah prastaav taiyaar kiya he
 How successful these new initiatives will be will depend on whether the state governments will be ready to raise electricity rates every year

 ) surakshabalon dwaara jammu-kashmir main aatank ke safaaye ke liye chalaae ja rahe oparation ol out ko shuru hue ek varsh ho gaye hai
 According to statistics, since the beginning of the year till date 164 local youths have taken the path of terrorism, over 180 terrorists have been killed and around 350-400 terrorists are active in the valley
 burhan vaani ke safaaye ke baad chalaa hinsa kaa daurjulai 2016 main hijbul commanderburhan vanike maare jane ke baad encounter, band or hinsa kaa daur sirf dakshin kashmir tak simit tha
 However, with the recent killing of terrorist Mannan Wani in North Kashmir and the increasing recruitment of terrorists at the local level, it seems that after South Kashmir, terrorism has now engulfed North Kashmir as well
 darasal july 2016 se pehle dakshin kashmir, uttar kashmir kii tulana main shant mana jaataa tha
 Whereas North Kashmir was considered a stronghold of cross-border militants who took refuge in the jungles of Bandipora, Baramula and Kupwara
 hijbul commander burhan vaani kii maut ke baad 6 maheene tak puure kashmir pradarshan kaa daur chalaa
 Although the security forces also succeeded in getting control of the situation, there was an increase in recruitment of youth from militant organizations from Anantnag, Kulgam, Shopian and Pulwama districts in the local level
 is bich uttar kashmir main hue suraksha balon se muthbhedon main adhiktar maare gaye aatanki seemaa paar se aae the, jabaki dakshin kashmir main maare gaye aatanki sthaneey thea
 Burhan, who became Burhan in the south and Mannan in the north, Burhan Wani, who hails from the Tral region of Pulwama district of south Kashmir, at one time became the face of terror in the valley
 uttar kashmir ke kupwada jile kaa rahane vaala mannaan vaani jo ki aligarh muslim uniwarsity main piechdi kaa chaatr tha or 7 janvari 2018 ko eke-47 ke saath uski photo viral hone ke ek din baad hijb-ul-mujahiddeen ne isaki pushti kii thi ki mannaan hijbul main shaamil hua he
 It became clear that till now everything is not going well in North Kashmir untouched by local terrorism
 10 oktober ko kupwada jile ke handwara ilaake main maare gaye aatanki mannaan vaani par surakshabalon ke sutron ke mutabik mannaan pichley 9 maheene se dakshin kashmir ke jilon main sakriy tha or use uttar kashmir main sthaneey yuvakon kii bhartee ke liye bheja gaya tha
 But before he and the young men were seduced to take up arms, he was killed along with one of his companions
 sthaneey yuvakon kii bade paimaane par ho rahi bharteesurakshabalon ke sutron ke anusaar uttar kashmir main sakriy zyaadaatar aatanki pakistani hai, jabaki dakshin kashmir main sthaneey aatanki sakriy hai
 Their masterminds sit across the border and instruct them
 seemaa paar baithe inke sarganaon kaa maananaa he ki sthaneey samarthan or sahanubhuti hasil karne ke liye inhen sthaniyon, khaskar uttar kashmir main bhi pair jamaana padegaa
 According to sources, there are 350-400 terrorists active in the Kashmir Valley and since January, 164 youths of the Valley have taken the path of terrorism
 yah sankhya pichley kuch varshon main badi he
 66 Kashmiri youths joined the terrorist organizations in 2015 and 88 Kashmiri youths in 2016, while the number increased to 120 in 2017
 or is saal janvari se ab tak yah sankhya 180 tak pahunch gai he
 In the month of October alone, the security forces have killed 17 terrorists of Hizbul and Lashkar
 2016 main kashmir main 150 or 2017 main 213 aatanki maari gaye the
 According to the data, in 2016, 28 terrorists were killed in 18 encounters in North Kashmir and in 2017, 32 terrorists were wiped out in 24 encounters
 lekin 2018 main uttar kashmir main 31 encounter main 40 aatanki maare gaye
 There was a ceasefire violation from across the border 44 times to infiltrate terrorists in the area of north Kashmir
 sutron ke mutabik abhi uttar kashmir main takreeban 100 aatanki sakriy hai jinamein 16 sthaneey shaamil hai
 Dual challenge for security forces: In South Kashmir, terrorists are threatening police personnel, army news, mainstream leaders through social media
 jise dekhte hue prashasan ne kai baar is ilaake main mobile, internet sevaayen bhi band kii
 Recently some videos from Kupwara and Baramulla districts of North Kashmir went viral in which the local terrorists related to lashkar-e-taiba were found threatening the panchayat election candidates and local leaders in the state that if they did not leave politics, then it was damaged
 Will have to suffer
 naam na bataane kii shart par jammu-kashmir police ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha ki uttar kashmir main dakshin kashmir kii tulana main aatankiyon kii sankhya kam nahin he
 Just as terrorists were seen in public gatherings, mosques and markets in South Kashmir, now in North Kashmir too, the local youths have started taking front from the security forces at the encounter sites and obstructing the encounter
 isliye is ilaake main bhi dakshin kashmir kii tarah kanoon vyavastha kaayam rakhane main mushkil kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 On the one hand, the let-based base in North Kashmir is finding it difficult for the security forces to maintain law and order, while on the other side it is also a challenge to wipe out the infiltrators from across the border before reaching the cities and towns
 isse pehle ghati kaa suraksha tantra santusht tha usne aatankwaad ko dakshin kashmir main simit kar rakhaa he, jabaki uttar kashmir main ranneeti seemaa paar se ho rahe ghuspaith par kendrit thi
 But now the challenge for the security forces is that Lashkar-linked militants are building their bases in Bandipora and Kupwara districts of North Kashmir

 He hit back at the BJP, accusing that the main opposition party does not think about the country and wants to come to power somehow before 2014
 unhone mukhya vipakshi dal se jaananaa chaha ki kya 1998 se 2004 tak koyala aanvanton ke jo bhi faisle kiye gayi hai ve sabhi radd kar diye jaayen or hajaaron karod kaa nuksaan kara diya jaye
 He said, 'this is not a general issue, it is a complex economic issue related to the future of the country

 jo vipaksh kah rahaa he, kya unhen uske nateezon ke bare main pataa he
 If power and steel plants do not get coal, they will have to import coal and the cost of imported coal is three times higher

 He said that there has never been any occasion when someone has uttered a word
 haa hamane kaig ke nishkarshon par asahmati jarur jataai he
 On the contrary, he cited the statements of some BJP leaders during the tenure of the NDA government, saying that when they make allegations, they do not think what they said
 unhone chunauti bhare lahaze main kaha ki bhaajapa ne kaig ke khilaaf jaise shabdon kaa istemaal kiya vaisaa koi shabd hamane kabhi istemaal nahin kiya
 He said that what happened during the NDA tenure was all right
 sab paardarshee tha
 All that we did was wrong
 unhone bhaajapa par aarope lagaaya ki ve karte kuch hai or kehete kuch or hai
 He called the Prime Minister a constitutional body like the CAG and said that if the CAG is a constitutional body, then the Prime Minister is also a constitutional body
 unhone saaf tair par kaha, ‘ham kaig kii report se sahamat nahin hai

 parantu alam yah he ki jahaan ek kai companiyaan 3 ji sevaaon ko abhi tak laanch bhi nahin kar paayi hai to vahiin duusari ore kai companiyaan jinhone 3 ji sarvice laanch to kar diya he lekin koi bahut shandaar sarvice nahin de paa rahi hai
 In the race to provide the fastest 3G service, companies want to make Indian customers their customers with this fast
 koi kahata he, aap isamen live tivi dekh sakate hai to koi kah rahaa he ki mobile se hi aap apni padhai kar sakate hai
 So someone claims that it will fulfill the need of internet in a blink of an eye
 lekin sawaal uthta he ki kya graahak sach main in sevaaon se khush hai yaa yah vigyaapan keval vigyaapan ban kar hi rah gaye hai
 According to Rohan, who studies in Delhi University, the things that are going somewhere in 3G service are not only wrong but also misleading
 rohan kaa kahana he, ‘maine 3 ji seva upyog karne ke liye naa keval 25 hajaar rupee phone main kharch kiye balki prati maheene mere phone kaa bill do hajaar rupee se zyada aane laga he
 Video calling facility can be called only by name because the picture of the front stops
 ’diu kii hi ek chaatra shilpi ne bataaya, ‘ham ladkiyaan hostel main rahete hai or maine nayaa phone or 3 ji seva keval yah soch kar liya tha ki mobile main hi match kaa lutf uthaaenge lekin live tivi ke naam par yah sarvice aapaki apekshaaon par ekadam khara nahin utarati
 Not only this, many people have also complained of call drops and voice breaks
 3 ji seva ko lekar mobile pradaataaon ke daftaron main shikaayatein badhati ja rahi hai
 People are feeling cheated on themselves
 ise istemaal karne waalon kaa kahana he ki companiyaan jitne daawey kar rahe hai uskaa aadhe se kam bhi yah apane ko sabit nahin kar paa rahe
 Yes, it can definitely be said that its condition can improve in the coming days

 If this does not happen then a very big movement will arise
 unhone aage kaha ki bijepi ko ab yah maan lenaa chahie ki unke mukhyadhara ke mudde se bhatak jane ke kaaran hi unka logon se sampark kataa he
 BJP should again raise issues like Ram Mandir and Uniform Civil Code
 pehle bijepi satta main aane ke liye inhen sab muddon ko uthaaya karti thi lekin jab se ye saare mudde bijepi ne chhod diya tab se sant samaaj ne party ko chhod diya he
 For the last 15 years, the Sant Samaj is unhappy with the BJP

 The party reached power on these issues and got 180 seats

 Singhal further said that if the BJP does not pay attention to this, then the Sant Samaj itself is capable of taking big decisions and they will also get the full support of the Hindu society

 ) First the breakdown of NSA level talks and now everything has to come to a standstill on Kashmir issue
 phir pakistan ke raksha mantri kaa ye kahana ki agar bharat ham par yuddh thopata he, to use baari nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 Now Army Chief General Dalbir Singh has said that in view of the changed strategy of Pakistan, our forces should be ready for small battles in the near future
 kya iske myne is tarah nikaale ja sakate hai ki bharat or pakistan paanchave yuddh kii ore bad rahe hai
 However, before this, Pakistan had to face defeat in the Kargil War of 1948, 1965, 1971 and 1999
 lekin phir ab waisi hi sthiti ban rahi he
 Let's try to understand this whole matter with 10 signs
 
 
 1
 The NSA talks were canceled at UFA in Honoros, which agreed to resume talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif
 uske baad tay hua tha ki 23 agast ko NSA str kii vaarta hogi
 But the issue of sending invitations to Kashmiri separatists from Pakistan caught fire and the talks of both the countries were canceled
 2
 Stopping everything on Kashmir The darkest aspect of postponing the NSA talks was that everything between India and Pakistan came to a standstill on the Kashmir issue
 pakistan ne kashmiri algaavvaadiyon ko nimantran waapas lene se inkaar kar diya to bharat ne saaf kar diya ki kashmir ko chhodkar vah kevalatankwaad ke masale par vaarta karegaa
 The road ahead from here seems difficult because both countries have set their own boundaries on Kashmir
 3
 Threats from Pakistani Defense Minister and Security Advisor After the break up of NSA talks, continuous threatening statements came from Pakistan
 isse saaf lagata he ki vaarta tuutane ke baad pakistan ko bharat kii ore se aatanki campon ko nasht karne ke liye karrwai kaa dar sata rahaa he
 First Pakistan's security adviser Sartaj Aziz threatened India, then the Defense Minister there threatened that if India imposes war on us, it could suffer heavy losses
 4
 Rajnath Singh's strong statement on the firing was going to be a case of terrorism as well as repeated ceasefire violations from India in the NSA talks, but after the talks broke down, now India has to respond to firing from across the border The only option left
 kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh ne seemaa par tainaat surakshabalon ko spasht sandesh diya ki pehle goli mat chalaao, lekin agal udhar se goli chalati he, to phir goliyon kii ginati mat karo
 This statement also refers to the growing relationship between the two countries
 5
 Army Chief's latest statement: On Tuesday, amidst constant threats from Pakistan, Army Chief General Dalbir Singh made it clear to the soldiers that they would have to be prepared for short battles in the near future, amidst increased cross-border infiltration and continued attempts of terrorism
 is bayaan se andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki aatankwaad ke khilaaf agar pakistan kaa dhulmul ravaiya jari rahaa to bharat pakistan ke ilaakon main maujuud aatanki campon ko nasht karne ke liye simit karrwai kar saktaa he
 6
 antarrashtriya samudaay kii ashankavarta tuutane, seemaa par lagaataar golibari badhane or donon kii ore se aa rahe talkh bayanon ko dekhte hughantarrashtriya samudaay bhi chintitahai
 China has appealed to both countries to exercise restraint
 saath america rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar sussain rice ne pakistan kaa apaat daura kar vahaan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif se mulaakaat kii
 Along with the tension between India and Pakistan, there is another matter of concern for the international community
 vah he pakistan main aatankiyon ke haath parmaanu hathiyaaron ke lag jane kii ashankaayen
 7
 seemaa par lagaataar ashaanti badhanaaise saal pakistan kii ore se 240 baar sijafire todaa gaya he
 In the month of August, there were 55 breakage of ceasefire
 pichley do hafte main seemaa paar sehui firing main jammu-kashmir ke seemaa ilaakon main teen aam logon kii maut hui jabaki nau ghayal hue
 On 15 August, there was a firing in areas of India by Pakistan
 rus ke upha main 10 july ko pradhanmantri narendra modi or pakistani piem navaj sharif ke bich mulaakaat hone ke baad pakistan ne 95 baar sijafire todaa he
 8
 mumbai hamalon main nyaayik prakriya kaa thahar janamumbai hamalon ke aropiyon ke khilaaf pakistan kii adaalaton main karrwai se bhi bharat ko kam hi ummiden hai
 Negligent position was adopted by the Pakistani agencies in the court against all the accused including Lakhvi
 aise main bharat ko mumbai hamalon ke sajeeshkartaaon ke khilaaf pakistan se kisi nyaay kii ummid ab kam hi he
 9
 pakistan kii aantarik sthitihaal ke dinon main pakistan ke andar kharaab hui sthiti bhi yuddh kii ore use le jane ke sanket kar rahi he
 All the terrorist organizations, including the Taliban, are carrying out continuous attacks inside the country, along with executing the conspiracy outside Pakistan
 queta main lagaataar aatmghaatee bam dhamaake ho rahe hai
 Apart from this, after the army's campaign against the tribal fighters in Baluchistan, the fighting there is intensifying
 itihaas par agar najar daalen ko jab bhi pakistan aantarik sankat se jujhane lagata he to ubarne ke liye bharat par yuddh thopane kii niti apanaataa he
 However, all the four wars so far, Pakistan has had to face defeat in the 1948, 1965, 1971 and 1999 Kargil wars
 10
 The increasing pressure on the Indian government is also a difficult time for the Indian government
 vaarta ke teble par aane se bachane ke liye pakistan kashmir mudde kaa sahaara le rahaa he
 On the international stage, India cannot take this issue because it constantly talks of a bilateral solution
 mumbai hamalon samet tamaam aatanki hamalon ke sajeeshkarta pakistan main sangrakshan paae hue hai or pakistan ise maanane ko taiyaar nahin
 Continuing firing from across the border and Pakistan is the reverse India accuses
 aise main bharat main sarkaar par janata kaa dabaav bad rahaa he ki pakistan ko sabak sikhaaya jaae
 In such a situation, the Government of India may have to take limited action against terrorist elements present in Pakistan and elements like Dawood Ibrahim
 sena pramukh kaa bayaan isi sthiti kii ore ishaara kar rahaa he

 unhone likhaa to isliye aapako sadhvi pragna(sadhvi Pragya) se koi samasya nahin he

 javed akhtar ne likhaa ki mujhe laga ki aap peedit hai, isliye maine sochaa ki is maamle par aap zyada samvedansheel honge
 So you have no problem with the Sadhvi

 Net (@ranbirkapoorfc)july 23, 2016yahi nahin, teenon ne saath main khub dance bhi kiya
 There was a time when Jaranveer Singh started dancing by picking up Ranbir Kapoor on the dance floor and Deepika Padukone was standing there cheering her
 bihar main rajnatik uthal-puthal ke bich bijepi ke liye apni maujuuda loksabhaa saansadon kii sankhya barkaraar rakhte hue jedy-you ko maat dene kii gambhir chunauti he
 In the alliance, the BJP has been fighting 17 seats out of 40 Lok Sabha seats, out of which the party currently has 12 mps
 lekin badale rajnatik sameekaran main use apni seat barkaar rakhana mushkil lag rahaa he
 Anyway, BJP is seeing Narendra Modi's influence in Bihar, but still the party is not in a mood to take any risk
 har loksabhaa siton ke liye party andruni taur se sameekaran or napha-nuksaan kaa akalan karne main jute chuki he
 Of this, the party's path is no longer easy for Bhagalpur Lok Sabha seat
 yahaan se philhal bijepi ke muslim cheharaa shahanvaj hossain saansad hai, jabaki unase pehle bihar ke purv upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi saansad the, jinhone rajya main upmukhyamantri banane ke baad istipha de diya tha
 Due to alliance with JD-U, the path of Shahnawaz Hussain in Bhagalpur was easy, but now the situation is not smooth
 bhagalpur se is baar khud susheel kumaar modi chunaav main utarane kaa man bana chuke hai
 In such a situation, the most difficult is that of Shahnawaz Hussain, for whom there is no easy seat
 bhagalpur se sthiti sahaj nahin dekh shahanvaj purniya seat se chunaav ladgaye kii yojana bana rahe the, lekin vahaan abhi bijepi se udai singh saansad hai
 From this seat, this time the Congress may field Bahubali Pappu Yadav in the elections, so the Purnia seat is not proving to be favorable for them
 so shahanvaj ab party ke bheetar khud kehane lage hai ki bhagalpur se susheel modi ko ladaaya jaae
 According to sources, Shahnawaz's reasoning behind this is that the party should not risk any seat because Bhagalpur is going to become a seat of prestige anyway
 in daleelon ke jariye shahanvaj party hit main bhagalpur seat susheel modi ke liye chhodie kii baat kar ‘shahid’ dikhaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 While the truth is that there is confusion in the party over contesting elections from there, they are unable to win a seat in the state
 ab shahanvaj apni shahadat ke jariye rajyasabha kii seat sunishchit karne kii firaaq main hai, taaki endie kii sarkaar banane kii sthiti main muslim chehre ke taur par kendriya mantrimandal main jagah mil sake
 But his opposition leaders in the party are now quipping, 'is it really martyrdom or helplessness? viraat kohli kii aguai main bhartiya cricket team westeindies ke daure par he
 The team enjoyed beach volleyball here in St

 Life is not the solution with yoga, but a lifestyle based on it shows us the way to a balanced life
 ham us par to chalate nahin, yogabhyas samaapt hote hi man vachan or karm se duusare ko parrast karne ke khel main lag jate hai
 a yogi cannot talk bitterly about anyone
 kya yoga karne vaale netaa aisa kar sakate hai
 Therefore they are leaders, not yogis
 yoga se jivan kaa samaadhaan nahin he, balki is par aadhaarit jivan style hamen ek santulit jivan kaa rasta bataati he
 We do not walk on it, as soon as the yoga practice is over, the mind gets engaged in the game of defeating the other by word and deed
 yogi kisi ke bare main katu baat kar hi nahin saktaa
 Can yoga leaders do this? isliye ve netaa hai, yogi nahin

 avadhesh narayan singh ne kaha ki aisa maamla pehle kabhi nahin hua, isliye isaki puri padtaal ke baad karrwai kii jaaegi
 It is believed that the BJP MLC is set to fall as it is a question of dignity of the upper house

 Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav has alleged that BJP is engaged in suppressing the case

 Sushil Modi has worked to suppress the matter
 kal kaala din tha
 We demand from BJP and PM that action should be taken on this
 puri ghatana CCTV main kaid he
 If someone in RJD does this, we immediately send him to jail, we ask the Chairman

 It cannot be denied that films are becoming experimental these days
 jahaan ek taraf bade bajet kii badi masala filmein darshakon kaa manoranjan kar rahi hai, vahiin experimental filmein bhi koi na koi sandesh lekar darshakon ke bich pahunch rahi hai or samaaj kaa aaina banakar unka cheharaa dikhaa rahi hai
 The story of these films may be fictional, but most of the stories are taken from real life
 ab taaja udhaaharan le lijie
 Producer Dhanraj Jethani, Anil Jethani and Chandresh Jethani's film 'yuva' will see the youth fighting for justice
 is film kii kahani javaani main kadam rakhte 15 se 17 saal ke chaatro kii he, jo police system se bhid jate hai
 The film's story is inspired by real events
 is film ko diarect kiya he jasbir bijendra bhaati ne
 The film stars Jimmy Shergill and Archana Puran Singh along with actors like Om Puri and Sanjay Mishra
 dhanraj jethaani, anil jethaani or chandresh jethaani isse pehle film 'ankur murder cese' bana chuke hai, jisaki kaaphi saraahna hui thi
 The producer of the film says that we got praise and courage from 'ankur Murder Case'
 unhone kaha, hamane film 'bin bulaae baaraati' naam kii masala film bhi banaai he
 But with a film like 'yuva', we also give some message along with entertainment, which is pleasant in itself
 vaaki is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki agar koi film manoranjan ke saath kuch sikh bhi de to kya bura he
 
 
 And it seems that Bollywood is also growing in interest
 tabhi to kabhi 'taare jameen par' banaakar shiksha pranali par bahes chhedi jaati he, to kabhi 'rang de basanti' jaisi film se javaanon ko jaagrit kiya jaataa he
 Sometimes the debate on the justice system is created by creating 'no One Killed Jessica', sometimes the injustice done to an athlete like 'paan Singh Tomar' is shown
