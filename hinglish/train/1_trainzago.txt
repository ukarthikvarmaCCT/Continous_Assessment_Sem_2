 a thin stream in the media from public opinion about Narendra Modi in Japan has opened many doors for progress like Mahanadi
 pehali baar modi se japani media april, 2007 main rou-ba-rou hua tha
 He then came to Japan with a 50-member delegation of Gujarat businessmen and state officials
 unhone vahaan apane rajya main laajawab kaarobaari maahaul kii duhai dekar japani nivesh kii apil kii thi
 He also met Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for the first time
 unki apil kaa vakt bhi makul tha
 The Indian economy had its good days
 2004 or 2005 main china main japan virdohi pradarshnon kii vajah se japani companiyaan apni gatividhiyon ke vistaar ke liye nae kaarobaari maukey talash rahi thi
 Till that time, China was the major destination for their investment
 bharat main gujarat ko acha ilaaka mana ja rahaa tha kyonki gujarat se hokar guzarane vaale dilli-mumbai audyogic corndor kii yojana aakaar lene lagi thi
 Opinions about Modi in Japan became very positive in 2008 after Tata Motors' Nano factory arrived in Gujarat from West Bengal
 hairaani kii baat yah bhi he ki kuch japaniyon kii raay main mukhyamantri ne mahaj chaar din main naino kii factory sthapit karvaa di thi
 The second round of rapid improvement in Modi's image in Japan came in July 2012
 us samay ek aupchaarik nimantran paakar modi doosraa pratinidhimandal lekar japan pahunche
 The Government of Japan welcomed him as if he were the Prime Minister
 modi phir abe se mili, jinaki libral democratic party (aldypi) tab satta se baahar thi
 The delegation held an investment seminar in Tokyo and other major cities that attracted a large crowd as interest in Japan and Modi grew by then
 janvari, 2011 main wibrant gujarat nivesh sammelan main kai japani udyogpati or sarkari adhikari shirkat kar chuke the
 In addition, the japan-india Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement was also entered into force from August 2011
 yah ek tarah kaa mukt vyapaar samjhaute jaisaa tha
 Hence, a favorable environment was beginning to develop in Japan for Modi and there was hope that he would one day be the leader of the Indian economy
 aktubar, 2011 main hi japani modi premi bhartiya nivesh paraamarsh form ke siio ne likhaa tha ki bhartiya rajyon main gujarat kii aarthik vruddhi sabase tej he
 It was indicated that Modi can become the Prime Minister of India
 lekin modi ke chhavi vistaar ke is duusare daur main bhi japaniyon kii unamem dilchaspee sirf kaarobaari or sarkari halkon tak hi simit thi
 The third round of Modi's image expansion came in September 2013 when the BJP announced him as its prime ministerial candidate
 is daur main saamaanya japani log bhi modi main dilchaspee lene lage
 The number of Modi's reports in the Japanese media gradually increased
 media kaa kawarej janvari, 2014 main us samay kaaphi bad gaya jab bharat main janamat surveykshan aam chunaavon main modi or bijepi kii rahul gandhi or congress par badhat dikhaane lage
 Media reports played a big role in Modi's image among ordinary Japanese
 japani media ne apni reporton main modi ko kitni tarjeeh di? sabase zyada is pahalu par jor diya gaya ki unka aarthik prabandhan laajawab he
 During his Chief Minister's tenure, Gujarat's rate of economic growth was 10 per cent, while India's economic growth rate declined after a good start in UPA-1
 duusare, gujarat bhrashtachar or bijli kii dikkaton se mukt lagata he
 There decisions are instant, which is not the case in other states
 jaapni media main modi ke kuch naare bhi khub charchaa main rahe
 For example, "not red lace, just red carpet for investors", "minimum government, maximum governance
" ’’modi kii abe se kareebi sambandh hai
 When Abe's LDP won a landslide victory in December 2012 and became the Prime Minister for the second time, Modi was among the first foreign leaders to congratulate him
 tab ve mukhyamantri hi the jabaki baaki badhai dene waalon main rashtradhyaksh the
 The Japanese media has also been showing similarities between Abe and Modi's policies
 donon hi arthvyavastha main teji laane ke himachati hai or apane-apane model abenomics or modinomics ke jariye rojgaar ke maukon kaa vistaar karte hai
 a section of the media also focused on the debate between Amatrya Sen vs Jagdish Bhagwati
 sen ko congress or samaaj kalyaan ke paksh main bataaya gaya jabaki bhagwati ko bijepi or vruddhi ke paksh main
 In the matter of defense policy, Abe insists that Japan is an advocate of peace, but military strength will also remain
 unhone america ke hadsan institute 2013 ke harman con award ke dauraan apane bhaashan main sweekaar kiya ki ve dakshinpanthi sanyvaadee hai
 Modi also insists on the recognition of the best India
 shaayad donon pradhanmantri aakraamak china se nibatane ke bare main ek jaisaa sochate hai
 Although Modi has carefully avoided exposing his China policy, the Japanese media focuses on his double-meaning comments
 masalan, arunachal pradesh main 22 farvari, 2014 ko apni chunavi sabha main modi ne kaha, ‘‘china ko apane vistaar ke nazariye ko chhodia hoga
 "then in an interview to a newspaper on May 6, 2014, he said," It will be helpful for both countries if India and China want to improve their relationship and move towards erasing differences
 ’’lekin denon netaaon main samaantaaon ke alaava kai ahm fark bhi hai jinase unka najariya taiyaar hota he
 For example, Abe was born into an important political family, while Modi has reached this milestone on his own
 japani media ne modi kii saraahna kii he lekin unke nakaaratmak paksh ko bhi jagah di he, khaskar 2002 ke gujarat dangon main unki bhoomika ko lekar
 Some newspapers and channels described the riots as genocide, some referred to BJP and Modi's prejudice against Muslims, it was also told that there are no Muslims among the new BJP mps
 swaabhaavik rup se japani media main bhartiya musalamaanon kii ashankaon kaa zikr bhi ubhara ki modi shaayad unke khilaaf kadam uthaaen
 In the media, the apprehensions of Indian journalist Siddharth Varadarajan were also given, the question is, "what happens if lashkar-e-taiba, Al Qaeda or some other Pakistan based terrorist organization attacks India?" To what extent will india-pakistan relations deteriorate in such a situation and how will Muslims be treated? ”most Japanese people will be surprised to hear of the riots under the Modi government, although many believe this will not happen again
 modi ke purvavarti manmohan singh ne japan or bharat ke dwipaksheeya rishton ko majboot karne ke liye kaaphi kuch kiya
 His media advisor, Sanjay Baru, wrote in his 2014 book The Accidental Prime Minister that "abe's return to power in 2012 brought the agenda alive, forging closer ties with Japan in the economic and defense sectors of UPA-2 foreign policy Became an important part of ’’modi is dwipaksheeya rishte ko aage badhaane kii acchhee sthiti main hai
 Abe's tenure is yet to last two and a half years
 isliye donon pradhanmantriyon ke paas apane rishte majboot karne kaa paryaapt samay he jo majboot dwipaksheeya rishte kaa bhi aadhaar banegaa
 i am often asked in the Japanese media whether Modi and Abe can open a common front against China, which is creating tension in Asia
 meraa jawaab yah he ki sirf is vajah se hamen unke bich saajhedaari ko sochakar ati utsahit nahin ho janaa chahie ki modi atal bihari vaajapeyi kii tarah dakshinpanthi vyaavhaariktavaadi hai or abe shaayad vishwa yuddh ke yakusukuni smarak par dobaaraa na jaaen
 We should not worry in vain about their partnership
 japani media saans roke intjaar kar rahaa he ki kya modi kaa pehla videsh daura japan kaa hoga

 madrasamanzoor ehteshamrajakmal prakaashan, dariyaganj, nai dilli-2,keemtah 350 ru
 No hurry: Manjoor Ehtesham Manjoor Ehtesham's novel Madrasa does not reveal any major issues in its story but the presence of different characters of the property mafia Ghani Mian and MP Imran Alam apart from Sabir, Maryam, Aligarh Mamu and Banngi Fufu of this time Fraud can be seen and felt far more clearly here
 yah or baat he ki manjuur ehteshaam ke pichley upanyaas bashaarat manzil ne kuch chatkh adarshavaadi tevar ke saath rashtrabhakt musalamaanon kii gandhivadi chhavi darshaate hue jis tarah kii kissagoi kii buniyaad rakhi thi, madrasa main yah kissagoi kuch chhin-bhinn hui he
 While advancing the novel at a slow pace, Manjur Saab does not appear to be in a hurry, but instead continues to tear away the kamkasha running in closed minds
 mumbai, bhopal, bareli, aligarh ke bich awajahi karata hua yah upanyaas jin or kuch kirdaaron ke bhaavbheene vrittant se buna gaya he vah hai nanijan, parchhaayi or aamir
 How the step of steplessness makes a person lonely and orphaned, how do his innocent dreams bear the unblemished markings of the boot of time and how does he dream of building a madrasa
 jameendo
 As it happens, Sabir has become synonymous with it
 aakhir ek roj sabir par yah raaj khulata he ki vah jise apana pita maanata he ve uske sautele abba hai, jinaki pehali bibi se kai santaanen hai
 He seems to be campaigning to get a share in the property but does not succeed
 uski talim bhi adhuri hi rah jaati he
 He reaches Bareilly, Aligarh and Banangi Fufu in search of his roots and Aligarh Mamu reveals that his mother was married to a person of old age from his mother long before his consent
 is rishte se uski nanijan is kadar khafa huin ki pakistan ja bases or aligarh maamu se rishta tod liya
 All the girls in the life of Sabir, who was a cricket stalker and later engaged in dyeing and painting, also came to know Alka, who was the daughter of a film producer, but it did not last long
 aakhirkaar sampann bedi parivaar kii jis ladki pinki se sabir ne muhabbat kii, usne mariyam ban kar uskaa daaman thama, par yah rishta bahut dinon tak use musiibat main daale rahaa
 By the time her daughter was born to Sayani and married, the gap between Sabir and Maryam had widened
 lihaaja sabir or mariyam jivan bhar lagbhag apane-apane ajanabi kaa jivan jite rahe
 The way Sabir eventually struggled for the sake of a piece of land at Tekri with the dream of a madrasa building was also shattered by land mafia
 is upanyaas kaa taana-bana bahut jatil nahin he, par iske indraj kabhi-kabhi ub paidaa karte hai
 The flow in the account is not the same as in Manjur's previous novels Drought Banyan, dastan-e-lapata and Basharat Manzil
 lihaaja kabhi-kabhi iske gadhy main aalasy se chalate-phirte kisi shaks kii-si chaaya numaayan hoti he
 Aligarh Mamu is fond of shero-shayari, quotes from film songs are spot on in her tongue, and Sabir looks for refuge in Ghulam Ali's shayari and liquor cup after he is estranged from Mariam
 madrase kii tamir kaa sapana sabir kii nekaniyati kaa hi saboot he par uske apane jivan main aise ucchadarshon kii kahin koi zyada shinaakht nahin milti
 The power that we need from Sabir is not there
 jar nahin aata
 Instead of turning into a torch, he is constantly lying
 yon dekha jaae to sabir kaa kirdaar us aam aadmi se bahut miltaa-julata he jisaki duniya main na rishte kaam aate hai, na maitri
 Whose faith is wavering, whose foundation rests on Yatimi, whose mother, while being a husband, has betrayed an older person who may have later converted into a marriage, who resembles her father's shadow- Even like a dead one jameen kaa tukdaa khojataa hua ant main 'haare ko harinaam' par laut aata ho-sabir aise thake-haare shaks kii numaaindgi karata prathit hota he
 The question arises that what does Manzoor Saab want to say through this novel? Its cut is in the blurb of the novel itself: it is never possible to say that its purpose is so much about any great creation
 
 
 balki vah hamaare hi jivan kaa ek zyada ujle prakaash main buna gaya chitra hota he jisase ham na jane kitni dishaao se roshni pate hai
 "perhaps this is the reason why it is said to be a pleasant intervention in the rhythmic landscape of contemporary Hindi novel, while not just galloping on the prevailing array of Kisagoi and justifying the novel beyond any elaborate discussion
" bina kisi vimarsh kii tayshuda jumalebaji main fanse is upanyaas main ek jagah amjad ke saath baatcheet main sabir kaa yah kahana ki ''meri haisiyat, is chalis saal ke aa
 No less than Jad country

 i am the form of freedom of the country
 meri shiksha bhale hi na ho pai lekin apane jivan main jo kuch hum tumhaare liye madrase se kam nahin
 The glory of this novel is hidden in this metaphor of independence

 Although the speed of its story may not have been so much approved, but the situation of the common man and sometimes common Muslim is present here

 'goa police ne is maamle main shoma se do din pehle lagaataar 8 ghante poochtacha kii thi
 Apart from this, Shoma was constantly defending her in this case, but she was constantly being questioned, after which she finally resigned from her post

 The woman journalist complained to her managing editor Shoma Chaudhary in an official mail
 iske jawaab main tarun ne yon utpeedan kaa aparaadh sweekaar karte hue maafee maangi thi or chah maheene ke liye apana pad chhod diya tha
 But there was a stir as soon as this mail became public

 Dear all, this time is very difficult for all the teammates associated with TEHELKA

 There was only two days to act on the complaint that the news came to the media before that

 As far as my feminist side is concerned, i think i acted accordingly, because i preferred my colleague's side
 haalanki, iske baavjood na sirf baahar ke logon ne balki media ne bhi mere upar baar-baar sawaal uthaae or mai is par ab sangyaan letaa chaahati hum
 i worked very hard for Tehelka for many years, whatever work i have done is special to me and i respect it
 main nahin chaahati hum ki meri sachai par sawaal uthaae jaae, jo ki tahalaka kii chhavi ko bhi kharaab karti he
 Therefore, i resign with the immediate post of Managing Editor
 mere kai pathak or sahyogi hai, jo is mushkil samay main mujh par bahut vishwaas kar rahe hai, main un sab kaa aabhaar prakat karti hum
 i will come to the office to close the case and give the necessary handover
 main bataa nahin sakati ki yah sab mere liye kitna takalifdeh he
 i do not want to leave this place in the middle of this challenge except Tehelka, but i have to
 main is samay tahalaka ke saath rahanaa chaahati hum par nahin jaanati ki meraa tahalaka ke saath rahanaa tahalaka kii madad karegaa yaa nuksaan pahunchayegaa
 i regret that i could not maintain the clarity under my leadership

 It is worth noting that earlier, Chief Election Commissioner Nasim Zaidi had said in May that the Bihar Assembly elections would be held in september-october
 haalanki jaidi ne chunaav kii taarikh ko lekar koi khulaasa nahin kiya tha, lekin samajha ja rahaa he ki ayog matdaan ko tyoharon se pehle samaapt karne par vichaar kar rahaa he

 In fact, despite holding elections for decades, our electoral system has neither been able to get out of the clutches of bureaucracy nor be people friendly
 ye prakriya itani jatil he ki adhikansh log vot daalane ko ab bhi jhanjhat or sirdard hi maanate hai
 From the top, the Election Commission is making this whole process more tedious, boring and expensive by prolonging the election programs
 jabaki iskaa thik ulta hona chahie tha
 The technology that is being used to conduct elections on a large scale today could not have been imagined at the time of Lok Sabha elections

 The counting of votes should be started as soon as the entire voting is over and a delay of three to four days should be stopped in this work
 chunaav ayog ne suraksha balon ke movement main kathinaayee ke naam par kai charnon main chunaav karaane kii jo parampara shuru kii ab wo aam ho gai he
 Leave the Lok Sabha, even in many states, assembly elections continue for two or two months in many stages
 saare chunaav ek saath kara paanaa shaayad abhi mumkin na ho paae, magar ayog ko us disha main aage badhanaa chahie
 By doing so, he will probably strengthen the faith in the democracy of thousands of millions of voters like Usha ji and prevent them from returning home empty-handed

 Referring to his busy schedule, he said, 'if i had time today, Morari would have gone to Bapu's program

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised Dawoodi Bohra Muslims in Indore and many people lost their beggars
 aisa isliye bhi he kyonki madhya pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bamushkil do maheene kaa vakt bachaa he
 The Prime Minister's move is also being compared to his 2011 fast for harmony and peace in Ahmedabad, where he refused to wear a forged cap offered by a maulana
 is baar chijen alag thim
 On September 14, the Prime Minister went to Indore to personally meet Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin, the spiritual head of the Bohra Muslims, but he told the world how much respect he had for the Ismaili Shia sect
 uske baad modi nange paanv paas hi sthit saifi masjid parisar pahunche or baad main unhone vahaan logon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, ''is samudaay ke saath unka lagaav bahut purana he
 He is overwhelmed by the support the community has given him and this is why he moved to Indore
 ''bohara samudaay ko apane 'parivaar' jaisaa bataate hue unhone kaha ki ve televijan par live prasaarit ho rahe is kaarykram kaa upyog duniya ko ''shanti, vikaas or sadbhaav ke liye boharaaon ke yogadan' se parichit karaane ke avasar ke rup main karnaa chaahate hai
 Interestingly, out of the non-bohra community, only the Prime Minister, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and his security squad were allowed to visit the site
 shesh log bohara samudaay ke varisht purush sadsy the
 Relations between Bohras and the majority Muslim Sunni community have been under stress for a long time and the arrival of Narendra Modi in Indore would only add to the resentment among the Sunni community
 boharaaon kii sankhya duniya bhar main bamushkil 10 lakh bataai jaati he or unamem se sabase bada bohara samaaj gujarat ke vyapaariyon kaa he
 In Madhya Pradesh, their number will not exceed one lakh and Bohra Muslims have the ability to influence the election results of less than six assembly constituencies
 lekin samudaay aarthik rup se bahut samrudh he
 So why did Prime Minister Modi go there? Although Modi said that he has a long standing relationship with Syedna and the visit is an effort to take those ties forward, but Modi has taken the initiative several times before to build relationships with small groups among Muslims
 masalan, pakistani-canadai barlavi netaa taahir-ul-kadri ke liye unka samarthan, jinhen sunni devbandiyon ke mukaable zyada udaaravaadi mana jaataa he
 Some Muslim leaders are referring to the Prime Minister's visit to Indore as an attempt to divide Muslim voters in Madhya Pradesh before the elections
 muslim political council of india ke tasalim ahamed rahamaani kehete hai, ''agar pradhanmantri vaaki samaveshi bananaa chaahate hai to unhen devband or imambada janaa chahie
 The Muslims of the state will vote very thoughtfully

 Before the ICC Cricket World Cup, which starts next month, 2015 and before the tri-series between Australia, England and India, India's first World Cup winner captain Kapil Dev has expressed hope of a win from current captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team
 dhoni ke test cricket se sanyas lene ke faisle ko behad bold faisla maanate hue kapil dev ne kaha, dhoni chaahate to aasaani se 100 test match khel sakate the, lekin unhone 90 test ke baad hi aankadon kii parvaah kiye bagaiyr test ko alavida kah diya
 
 
 Kapil says that the work he could not do by himself or many other cricketers like him, Dhoni did it

 After his 90th Test, Dhoni said goodbye to five days of classic cricket, there were many speculations and controversies about the reasons for retirement, but most experts considered it to be a very bold decision for Dhoni
 kapil ne kaha, dhoni ne jo kuch kiya he, usase administrators bhi sabak le sakate hai
 Seeing Dhoni, now the officers can leave the decision to remain in the chair for 30 years or entire life
 unhone kaha ki vakt aa gaya he ki team india do yaa teen captainon kii niti par vichaar kare
 He proposed a formula for different captains to be kept for different formats
 unhone kaha ki aisa vakt bhi aa saktaa he ki team india main non-plaing captain ke rakhe jane par vichaar kiya jaae
 Speaking during the fourth Pataudi Memorial Lecture in Kolkata, Kapil also praised former captain Tiger Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi
 kapil ne worldcup main team india kii jeet kii ummid jataai or team ko sabase bade toornament ke liye shubhakamanaayen bhi deen

 For a long time the central government employees are awaiting a decision on the recommendations made by the Modi government on the allowances made in the Seventh Pay Commission
 kendra sarkaar ne pichley saal june main saatven vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko manjuuri de di thi lekin bhatton par kii gai siforeeshon ko rivyuu karne ke liye vitt sachiv ashok lavasa kii cameti gathit kar di thi
 It is expected that this committee will submit its report to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday
 vetan ayog ne kendra sarkaar ke karmchaariyon keehouse rent alouns main katauteekarte hue 24 fisadi karne kii sifarish kii he
 Central employees used to get 30 per cent HRA from the Sixth Pay Commission
 kuch reports ke mutabik rivyuu cameti ne echaare kii dar main katautee nahin karne kii sifarish kii he
 It is worth noting that the Central Government constituted the Review Committee on the allowance of Central employees in July 2016
 shuruyaat main cameti ko apni sifarish karne ke liye 4 maheene kaa samay diya tha jise baad main badhaakar 22 farvari 2017 kar diya gaya tha
 The Seventh Pay Commission had recommended the abolition of 52 allowances out of the 196 allowances received by the Central Employees since the Sixth Pay Commission and asked for merging 36 allowances among themselves
 vetan ayogne 12 bhatton main kisi tarah kaa koi badlaav nahin kiya tha
 The main things related to the Pay Commission - It is noteworthy that 47 lakh central employees and 53 lakh pensioners will get direct benefit of the increase in the Pay Commission
 isamen sena ke 14 lakh karmchaaree or 18 lakh pension bhogi bhi shaamil hai
 Right now the government has been able to give increase in basic salary only to most of the employees, while the amount of allowance is yet to be decided
 -kendra sarkaar kaa pichley saal july main aae notification ke mutabik kendriya karmchaaree kii newmatam selary 7,000 rupee prati maah se badhkar 18,000 rupee ho gai thi
 At the senior level, 2 to the Cabinet Secretary
 5 lakh rupee tak kii selary mil sakati he jabaki saatven vetan ayog kii siforeeshon se pehle use mahaj 90,000 tak kii selary milti thi
 So, one thing is clear that due to the time taken by the Central Government in this decision, it is not giving allowance to the employees of the Central Government from the budget of the current financial year (2016-17)
 isse vetan ayog kii siforeeshon secendra sarkaar ke khajaane par pade bojko sarkaar ne agle vitt varsh ke liye taal diya or maujuuda vitt varsh main sarkari khajaane ke liye bachat karne me kaamyaab hui he

 Let me tell you, earlier on November 16, Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said that the government will import one lakh tonnes of onions through the MMTC
 sarkaar ne pyaaj kii uplabdhta behatar banane ke liye nijee aayaat ko bhi manjuuri di he or dhrumikaran evam swatchta ke praavdhaanon ko bhi saral banaaya he
 The government has taken this step at a time when prices have skyrocketed due to shortage of onions in the domestic market
 dilli main pyaaj kii khudara keemten 60 rupee prati kilogram tak pahunch gai
 This crisis has arisen due to 26 percent decline in onion production in Kharif season 2019-20

 loksabhaa main congress netaa mallikarjun khadke ne sarkaar kii nitayon par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki vipaksh ko daraaya ja rahaa he
 He said that whatever is happening in Parliament is opposed to the intention of the government
 hangaame ke bich khadge ne kaha, 'is vakt desh main do kanoon hai
 There are different laws for both the ruling and the opposition
 sarkaar kii niyat kharaab he or vah daman kii niti apana rahi he
 Opposition is opposing the same thing
 ' loksabhaa spikar sumitra mahajan se apil karte hue unhone kaha, 'hamaari baton ko karrwai se hataaen nahin
 "congress is threatening the court in Parliament" Questioning the opposition of Congress, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu said that the opposition is creating a ruckus without reason
 sarkaar har mudde par charchaa ke liye taiyaar he, lekin ve log samay barbaad kar rahe hai
 He also said that the government has no role in the National Herald case
 congress sansad main court ko dhamka rahi he
 In Rajya Sabha too, there was a lot of uproar in the ruckus in the Rajya Sabha for the second consecutive day and due to this, the house was adjourned till 11:30 AM and then till 12:15 PM
 baad main teesri baar sadan ko do baje tak ke liye sthagit kar diya gaya
 Congress mps shouted slogans in the House
 congress ne yahaan bhi sarkaar par badale kii raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaate hue hangaamaa kiya
 The visit of the next Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, is an extraordinary saga of a man, who was as much cheered by his opponents as he was by his supporters
 jiske samarthakon kaa kahana he ki ek vahi hai jo desh ko jhanjhawaton se nikaal le jayega
 During his tireless and goal-focused election campaign that brought Narendra Modi to the top of power, he said, 'I believe that God has chosen me
 ' apane jabardast chunaav prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan 63 varshiya modi ne khud apni ankhon se congress virodh or uske saath hi endie ke joardaar samarthan kii aandhi ko mahasoos kiya
 Dismissing the charge of being a dictator, Modi said during the campaign that he believes in teamwork and those who have worked with him know that he is a strong-willed decision-maker
 modi ne apane virodhiyon par aarope lagaaya tha ki vah unpar hamale karne ke liye bahut hi aspasht, vaiyaktik or phijul aarope lagaate hai or unhen taanashaah, vibhaajankaree or behad kattar bataate hai
 He said that there is no serious allegation against him like corruption, nepotism or incompetence
 party ke kendriya netritv ke 'dilli club' main ek bahari vyakti kii haisiyat rakhane vaale modi ne party ke bheetar or baahar unhen lekar hue saare virodh ko, bijepi ke liye centre main sarkaar banane ke vaaste jaruri bahumat se bhi zyada siten jutakar ek tarah se dhata bataa di
 The BJP has managed to achieve a tremendous majority under his leadership, as in 1984, under the leadership of Rajiv Gandhi, the Congress had won more than 400 seats and no other party has done so in the meantime
 laalkrishna adwani jaise party ke varisht netaa or anya ke virodh kaa saamana karne ke baavjood 63 saal ke sangh prachaarak modi ne solahavin loksabhaa ke chunaav ke liye deshbhar main aisa athak abhiyaan chalaaya jis par savaar hokar bhartiya janata party ne apana ab tak kaa sabase badhiya pradarshan kiya
 Having been present in the country's politics for the last three decades, the party was yet to register such a grand victory
 modi ko jab sitambar main party kaa pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya gaya, tab bhi unka kaaphi virodh hua tha, lekin yah virodh unhen bijepi ko 2004 ke baad dobaaraa sattashin karne ke unke lakshya se diga nahin paaya
 Initially, a lot of doubt was raised about whether Modi would be able to match the aura of senior BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 vaajapeyi ko unke pratidwandvi bhi kaaphi udaaravaadi maanate the or unki vajah se sahyogi dal bhi endie ke saath jutate the
 But, the BJP had full faith in Modi and in return for that trust, the party started getting support from more parties before the elections
 khaastaur se un dalon kaa bhi, jinhone 2002 ke gujarat dangon ke liye modi ko aaropee tehraakar endie se naata tod liya tha
 The other party or their adversaries may address Modi with addresses such as those who divide the society, polarize and fanatical Hindutvaists and are accused of anti-muslim riots in Gujarat, but Modi's supporters consider him 'such a strong leader' Will never do the politics of appeasement adopted by the opposition
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke pad par apane kareeb 12 saal ke kaarykaal ke dauraan modi ne apni chhavi ek aise netaa ke rup main gadhi jiske paas pichley kuch varshon se 'nitigat jadta' se jujh rahe desh kaa shashan chalaane ke liye ek vaikalpik drushtikon he
 During his campaign, making development his main issue, Modi tried very hard to reach out to the youth power, middle class and rural people to assure them of 'the winds of change' and perhaps this was their effort, however Attempts to polarize the electorate by occasionally picking up some of the favorite themes of the saffron forces also appeared in his campaign
 ek kushal yojanakaar modi ne, railway stesan par chaay bechney vaale se lekar bharat kaa ek lokapriy netaa banane tak kaa safar badi safalataa se puraa kiya, haalanki unke bahut se virdohi unke is daawey se sahamat nahin hai ki vah kabhi chaay bhi bechaa karte the
 In the state considered to be the 'laboratory of Hindutva' of the Sangh Parivar, Modi had made his image as Chief Minister a fanatic, who was winning his victory for election for three consecutive elections
 loksabhaa chunaav main alpsakhyakon, khaastaur par musalamaanon kaa samarthan hasil karne ke liye unhone jaanate boojhte apni kattar hindutvvaadi chhavi ko tyaag diya or apana puraa dhyaan vikaas ke mudde, khaastaur se garib musalamaanon ke vikaas par kendrit kiya
 Irrespective of the party's opposition for being declared the prime ministerial candidate, Modi cleverly ran a relentless and high-tech campaign for the general election as never seen before
 is abhiyaan ke tahat unhone deshbhar main 450 se zyada reliyon ko sambodhit kiya
 Born in the backward 'modh Ghanchi' (teli) community in the historic Vadnagar town of Mehsana, Gujarat, Modi's rise is an extraordinary event, although many of his opponents do not even consider him to be associated with the backward community
 sangh ke prachaarak or 1985 main bijepi main kaam karne ke liye bheje gaye modi gujarat ke mukhyamantri pad par aktubar 2001 main kabiz hone se pehle tak party ke aise padaadhikari the, jo parde ke peeche kaam karte the ore party ke liye ranneeti taiyaar karte the
 Just five months after he took over as chief minister, his image became a controversial leader in the 2002 Gujarat riots cases after a fire in a coach of the Sabarmati Express and the death of 59 karsevaks in it
 unpar dangon ke dauraan akarmanya bane rahane kaa aarope laga, lekin us cond kii jaanch ke liye bani sabhi jaanch samitiyon ne jaanch ke baad unhen sabhi aaropon se mukt kar diya
 These include the report of the Special Investigation Team formed under the direct supervision of the Supreme Court
 gujarat main hui farji muthbhedon ke mudde par bhi modi par lagaataar aarope lagate rahe hai ore unke kareebi sahyogi amit shah ne to haal tak in aaropon kaa saamana kiya, lekin modi pratikulata paristhitiyon ko avasaron main badalane kii kala ko bakhubi jaanate hai
 He carried out some such development schemes in Gujarat, due to which he got immense public support in 2007 and 2012
 modi kaa daawa he ki unhone apni pahchaan ko nae sire se talashne kii prakriya main vikaas ke mudde ko samoochee raajnneeti ke centre main laa diya he
 Modi declared a 'sadbhavna fast' to reach out to Muslims in Gujarat after the Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team declared him as a clean Pakistani in the 2002 riots case in Gujarat
 aise hi upwas unhone gujarat ke anya shaharon main bhi kiye
 Modi has been beating the Gujarat model of development a lot, and is also promoting his government's industry-friendly policy, although there are some critics

 desh ke purv soochna evam prasaaran mantri manish tiwari kaa kahana he ki chunaav main narendra modi or unki party bijepi ne jhuthe vaade karke janata ko chalaa he
 In today's program 'sidhi Baat', Manish Tiwari made many serious allegations against the Modi government
 unhone kaha, 'narendra modi ne chunaav ke dauraan jhuthe vaade kiye
 Why did not the public know that strict measures would have to be taken to control inflation
 kai jaruri chijen mahangi ho jaaengi
 The most important thing is that the Modi government has to take responsibility for its tough decisions
 ab vah apane faislon ke liye upie or uski nitiyon ko jimmedaar tehraana band kare
 'manish Tiwari further said,' This government has made many mistakes in just one month
 aane vaale samay main is sarkaar ko kai mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padegaa, or aise samay main congress phir se ekajute hogi
 We will play the role of positive opposition

 His decision has sent a wrong message to some organizations in Pakistan
 in sanghathanon ko aisa lagata he ki aatank ke khilaaf bijepi kaa sakht ravaiya sirf chunavi propaganda tha
 In the "sidhi Baat" program, Manish Tiwari also answered questions related to Congress and Rahul Gandhi
 intervyuu ke mukhya ansh
 
 sawaalh rahul gandhi ke chuttee lekar ghoomane ke masale par aap kya sochate hai?manish tiwari-har vyakti kii apni style hoti he or vah usee ke anurup kaam karata he
 The allegations being made on Rahul Gandhi are baseless
 kai vyakti jo kaam choubees ghante main karte hai vah duusare vyakti chaar ghante main kar lete hai, to zyada der kaam karne kaa matlab ye nahin ki aap bahut kaabil hai
 Working too long may also mean that you are not very capable
 kyonki offis ke liye nirdhaarit samay main aap kaam nahin kar paa rahe hai
 The natural law is that the person works for some time and rests for some time
 isliye ye kahana ki ek vyakti chuttee letaa he, nahin letaa he, uske kaam karne kii kshamta zyada, kam he yah bilkul bebuniyaad aarope he
 Question: Will Rahul Gandhi be able to beat Modi? Manish tiwari-congress party workers and leaders have not lost their morale
 lekin is baat par chintan ho rahaa he ki das saal tak hamane sarkaar chalaai, sarkaar main rachanaatmak kaam hue
 Despite this, it has been defeated
 haar ke kaarnon par bahut hi gambhirtha se chintaa karne kii zarurat he
 And there is a need to take such steps so that we can win the trust of the people, then it does not mean that morale has dropped
 sawaalh mallikarjun ko netaa vipaksh bana diya, unhen loksabhaa main kahana chahie tha ki main duungaa modi ko maat, naa ladanaa chaahate hai, naa bhidana chaahate hai
 Want to have a holiday 
 
 
 
 manish tiwari-netaa vipaksh ban jaae to phir aap vanshavaad kaa aarope lagaana shuru denge
 We made a senior leader from the Dalit community a leader of the opposition
 rahul gandhi ke paas upaadhyaksh kaa pad he to iskaa matlab ye nahin ki unke paas netaa vipaksh kaa bhi pad hona chahie
 The Leader of the Opposition has made someone else so that the work of Parliament can also be run smoothly and the party can be reconstructed
 aapke aarope bilkul bebuniyaad he or dekhiegaa aane vaale maheenon main jaise jaise ye sarkaar galati karegi, agar iske pehle ek maheene kaa vishleshan kare to is sarkaar ko aane vaale dinon main kaaphi kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 And at that time the Congress will play the role of a constructive opposition
 sawaalh pehle rahul gandhi or uske priyanka gandhi ke bachche
 
 isi tarah congress kaa netritv rahegaa
 The Manish tiwari-nehru Gandhi family is emotionally attached to the Congress Party
 sawaalh tital hi desh chalaane ke liye kaaphi nahin he
 Manish Tiwari - i am ready to listen to you
 sirf tital hi nahin thos kaam bhi rahaa he
 The way Sonia Gandhi led from 1999 to 2004 and the way she opposed communal powers
 isliye 2004 main congress party upie bana pai or hamaari sarkaar bani
 So it was not only because of the surname, he also left the post of Prime Minister
 or das saal tak us par khadi rahi
 Therefore, to say that the Congress believes in only one family and dynasty
 wo parivaar congress party or is desh kaa jo abhipraay he usamen vishwaas rakhata he

 And also gave his team a fightable score

 On Saturday, no political party joined the Election Commission's challenge of hacking the machine by disturbing the Electronic Voting Machine (EVM)

 Chief Election Commissioner Nasim Zaidi said that only NCP and CPI-M participated in the open challenge organized by the Commission
 haalanki chunauti main shaamil hone aaye donon dalon ke pratinidhiyon ne iviem hack karne ke bajaay mashin ke takneekee pahaluon se judi kuch bhrantiyon ko dur karne kaa anurodh kiya
 The Commission had on May 12 invited all recognized national and state-level political parties to participate in the open challenge after the all-party meeting held on complaints of malfunctions in evms
 lekin 3 june ko yojit hone vaali chunauti ko sweekaar karne kii 26 may ko nirdhaarit samay seemaa main sirf do dalon (ensipi or makapa) ne hi aavedan kiya tha
 Zaidi said that the commission had chosen to provide the claimants to hack the 14 machines used in 12 assembly segments in the recently concluded five state assembly elections
 unhone bataaya ki donon dalon dwaara mashin hack karne kii anichhaa jaahir karne par unki maang ke mutabik ayog kii takneekee visheshgyon kii samiti ke sadasyon ne donon dalon ke pratinidhiyon ko iviem ke takneekee pahaluon kii vistaar se jaankaree di
 Zaidi said that NCP MP Vandana Chavan raised the issue of requesting the Commission to provide the evm's memory number and battery number four days ago
 lekin is par ayog ke pratinidhi sudhir jain ne unhen bataaya ki chunauti main shaamil mashine silband thim or ye donon number chunauti ke dauraan hi unhen muhaiyaa karaaye ja sakate hai
 This fact was already conveyed to Chavan by the Commission

 But he rejected it
 haalanki ensipi ke pratinidhiyon ne ayog dwaara antim samay main iviem ke chayan kii shart main badlaav karne par virodh darj karaate huye kaha ki ayog ne pehle raajnneetik dalon kii marji se iviem mashin muhaiyaa karaane kaa vikalp diya tha lekin baad main ayog dwaara chaynit 14 mashiinon main se kisi ek mashin ko chunane kaa vikalp diya gaya
 The comments jaidi ne bataaya ki is aapatti ke saath ensipi ne bhi chunauti se pallaa jhaad liya
 However, party representatives expressed satisfaction with the EVM by resolving 8 doubts about the EVM with the technical committee
 jaidi ne iviem ko lekar vyaapt shankaaon ko dur karne main sabhi raajnneetik dalon ke sakaraatmak sahyog kaa swaagat karte huye kaha ki isse desh main loktantric mulyon kii gahari jadon ko majbootee milegi
 Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which has been loudly claiming the disturbances in evms, had already distanced itself from it, rejecting the terms of the challenge organized by the Commission
 haalanki ayog dwaara yojit iviem chunauti ke samanaantar aap kii ore se bhi aaj iviem chelange main hissaa lene ke liye chunaav ayog sahit anya pakshakaron ko aamantrit kiya gaya
 Party spokesman Saurabh Bhardwaj said that representatives of the Commission, political parties, EVM maker and other experts have been invited to participate in the challenge of hacking evm-like machines

 But only two parties (NCP and CPI-M) applied in the deadline set on May 26 to accept the challenge to be held on June 3
 jaidi ne bataaya ki ayog ne chunauti ke liye haal hi main sampann paanch rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav main 12 vidhansabha kshetron main istemaal kii gayi 14 mashiinon ko hack karne ke liye daavedaaron ko muhaiyaa karaane ke liye chunaa tha
 He said that according to his demand that both the parties expressed reluctance to hack the machine, the members of the committee of technical experts of the Commission informed the representatives of both parties in detail about the technical aspects of EVM
 jaidi ne kaha ki ensipi saansad vandana chahvan ne is dauraan chaar din pehle unke dwaara ayog se iviem kaa memory number or bydaree number muhaiyaa karaane kaa anurodh karne kaa mudda uthaaya
 But on this the Commission representative Sudhir Jain told him that the machines involved in the challenge were sealed and both these numbers could be provided to them only during the challenge
 is tathy se ayog ne chahvan ko pehle hi avgat kara diya tha
 The Commission once again proposed to hack the machine, providing NCP representatives the option to reveal the evm's memory number and battery number during the challenge itself
 lekin unhone ise asweekaar kar diya
 However, NCP representatives lodged a protest against the change in the condition of selection of evms at the last minute, saying that the Commission had earlier given the option to provide evms at the will of political parties but later on 14 machines selected by the Commission Was given the option to choose one machine from
 tippaniyan Zaidi said that with this objection NCP also overcame the challenge
 haalanki iske evaj main party ke pratinidhiyon ne iviem ko lekar 8 shankaaon kaa takneekee samiti ke saath samaadhaan kar iviem ko lekar santushti jaahir kii
 Zaidi while welcoming the positive support of all political parties in removing doubts about evms, said that this will strengthen the deep roots of democratic values in the country

 Describing the challenge organized by the commission as just a sham, Bhardwaj said that by going a step ahead, the registered applicants at Hackathon will be given a chance to make any kind of disturbances from the motherboard to the software in the machine

 The UPA government's differences came to the surface after the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) expressed 'serious objection' to the Congress's methods of running a coalition government
 rakanpa adhyaksh evam krishi mantri sharad pavaar tathaa baari udyog mantri prafull patel ke apane mantralay nahin jane se unke istife kii atakalon ko or bal mila
 Despite Pawar's talks with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi, the deadlock has so far persisted and the NCP has called a party meeting on Monday to decide the strategy ahead
 duusari ore, pradhanmantri or congress party donon ne hi pavaar ko apana bahut upyogi sahyogi bataakar maamle ko sulajhane kii koshish kii
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh approached the angry Sharad Pawar and described him as a 'very helpful ally' but there is no indication of what the Congress leadership is going to do to address ncp's concerns
 vahiin congress ne rakanpa ke saath gatirodh ko zyada tool nahin dete hue kaha ki rakanpa pramukh sharad pavaar samprag ke ek varisht or sammanit netaa hai or party ke saath sabhi muddon ko baatcheet ke jariye sulajhaa liya jaayegaa
 The day after Pawar and his party colleague Praful Patel did not attend the cabinet meeting as a protest, the NCP chief met Congress President Sonia Gandhi to discuss the party's grievances
 dilachasp baat yah he ki naaraaz pavaar samprag or congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se milane apni saansad beti supriya sule kii nijee car se gaye
 This was bolstered by speculation about his resignation as a minister
 krishi mantri pavaar or unke saathi baari udyog mantri prafull patel shuukravaar ko apane mantralay nahin gaye
 Pawar later held consultations with senior colleagues of his party
 iske baad patel ne kaha ki rakanpa sarkaar ke kaamkaaj or gathbandhan ke sanchaalan ko lekar naakhush he or ise congress netritv ko bataa diya gaya he
 Patel said that the UPA-II government was entering the last two years of its tenure and NCP wanted the government to be 'more decisive' and 'more committed' on public issues
 unhone kaha, ‘hamaare kuch mudde hai jisapar ham kuch badlaav chaahate hai
 He said that the party would remain a part of the UPA
 patel ne in khabaron ko khaarij kar diya ki pavaar sarkaar main number do kii haisiyat nahin die jane se naaraaz hai
 After putting the ball in the court of Congress to redress the grievances of the party, the party will meet on Monday to decide the future policy on the issue
 vahiin congress ne rakanpa ke saath gatirodh ko zyada bhav nahin dete hue kaha ki rakanpa pramukh sharad pavaar samprag ke ek varisht or sammanit netaa hai or party ke saath sabhi muddon ko baatcheet ke jariye sulajhaa liya jaayegaa
 Congress general secretary and head of media department Janardan Dwivedi told reporters, 'sharad Pawar is a senior and respected leader in our eyes
 samprag main unhen isi sammaan ke saath dekha jaataa he
 Dwivedi also said that there is no serious problem and a solution will come out
 party main asahajata ko jaahir karte hue rakanpa ke ek varisht netaa ne kaha ki sahyogi dalon ke saath vichaar-vimarsh kaa abhaav he or un muddon kaa samaadhaan nikaalane ke liye samanvay samiti kaa abhaav he
 He said that administrative and political issues had accumulated due to the Congress not taking along coalition partners
 singh ko beeti raat pavaar kii ore se bheje gaye patr main in baton ko shaamil kiya gaya tha
 The old Congress ally asked, "are allies of the coalition confined only to the Ministry or to its department
" kyon kisi nirnay main unhen shaamil nahin kiya jaataa
 'he said,' My party has never felt that we have any role other than the ministry and affairs that we have
 ’party netaa ne kaha ki samprag samanvay samiti gathit karne ke mudde ko bhi rakanpa ne uthaaya lekin usapar amal nahin kiya gaya
 Asked about the resignation, Patel said, "as of now we have neither formally resigned nor have any question to accept it
 mudda istipha nahin he
 Only a letter has been sent to the Prime Minister
 ’patel ne purajor tareeke se kaha ki unke netaa pavaar kii apni shakhsiyat he or sarkaar main number do rahe pranav mukherjee ke baad unka sthaan rahaa he
 He said, 'pawar is not such a petty leader who makes such small talk himself
 hamaare mudde bade hai
 The number two status is being exaggerated
 apni shakhsiyat ke kaaran hi pavaar (sansad main) sonia gandhi ke baad or (mantrimandal kii baithkon main) pranav mukherjee ke baad baithte rahe hai

 " Targeting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh once again, senior BJP leader LK Advani said that he is the weakest Prime Minister due to which his government is showing signs of being 'near the end after several organs become inactive'
 kamjor va anirnaayak hai pradhanmantri: adwaniisase do din pehle pradhanmantri ne adwani se apane khilaaf kathor bhashaa kaa istemaal nahin karne ke liye kaha tha
 Advani said in a press conference that the Prime Minister has said that we should not use strong words
 maine kya kathor shabd kahe? maine keval itnaa kaha ki jawaharlal nehru se lekar sabhi pradhanmantriyon main manmohan singh sabase kamjor hai
 This is a political comment
 isamen kathorta kahaan he?kade shabdon se bachein adwaniah manmohan singhpane bayaan ko waapas nahin lene par jor dete hue bhaajapa netaa ne kaha ki pradhanmantri kaa kahana he ki vah aahat hue hai kyonki maine unhen sabase kamjor pradhanmantri kaha
 If it is unfair to describe the reality in the same way, then i am guilty but not me but the Supreme Court has said that the 2G scam could have been avoided and if Manmohan Singh ji had shown activeness then 1 would be due to the treasury
 76 lakh karod rupee ke anumaanit nuksaan ko roka ja saktaa tha
 Taking an equally strong stand on the Congress, the former Deputy Prime Minister said that with the passing of every day, all the signs of the end are visible in the UPA government, which is being led by Manmohan Singh by name but control by Sonia Gandhi She has been adwani ko manmohan par aata he tarasadwani ne kaha ki samprag ke kai purv mantri bhrashtachar ke aaropon main tihaad main hai, anya vahaan jane ke liye qatari main khadey hai
 Senior ministers of the Prime Minister's own party are publicly criticizing each other and talking contradictory
 unhone kaha ki sattarudh party ke sabase taqatvar mahasachiv roj aise bayaan dete hai jinka niyamit rup se party ke anya netaaon ko khandan karnaa padataa he
 This type of condition in a patient is called dysfunction of multiple organs
 adwani ne kaha ki trinmul congress jaise samprag ke sahyogi dal manmohan singh sarkaar se duuri bana rahe hai, jisaki alokapriyata badhati ja rahi he
 However, he does not want to make his frustration public at the moment
 laalkrishna adwani kii jan chetana yatra shuruuadwani ne guuruuvaar ko kaha tha ki trinmul congress adhyaksh mamata banerjee ghotaalon ko lekar chup kyon hai? vahiin aaj unhone kaha ki vah mamata ke bebaak bayanon kii kami mahasoos kar rahe hai
 The BJP leader said that at the core of differences within the UPA, there is a growing anger against the planned loot of the country
 unhone kaha ki sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan ko ‘vibhajit pragatisheel gathbandhan’ kaha janaa chahie
 Advani said that 2G, Commonwealth, Adarsh, Air India and many other scams are examples of this
 duniya main bharat kii chhavi is samay sabase nichle paaydaan par he kyonki shashan chalaa rahaa gathbandhan bhrashtachar kaa paryaay ban gaya he
 On the corruption charges against his party leader and former Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa, Advani said that as far as our party is concerned, we have never been soft on corruption charges
 jaise hi lokayukta kii report ai hamane unase istipha dene ko kaha
 He said that due to ncp's anger due to the image of the Congress being a party of massive corruption at high levels of government, Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar has given a fresh statement against Sonia Gandhi's ambitious Food Security Bill

 iske baad unhone third party QR code scinar se ise scan kiya or unhone ek URL mila
 He transferred the URL generated from the QR code scanner to another mobile via whatsapp in which he had already logged into the test Facebook account
 bheje gaye URL ko clic karne se unase log in karne ke liye Allow or Deny kaa opshan aayaa
 The researcher says that here he hoped that an error would be found
 lekin aisa nahin hua or wo test acount ko apane computer main kholane main safal ho gaye jo unke liye hairaani bharaa tha
 For this they did not even need to enter the password
 unhone aisa kai baar tri kiya or wo har baar safal hue
 They have also used cross cy forging request for this

 It had a budget of 10 crores and the film did triple business at the box office
 tarif ke saath film ko 2 neshnal aword or film fere awords bhi die gaye the
 Now its sequel 'jolly LLB 2' is ready with Akshay Kumar in the lead role in place of Arshad Warsi
 court ke aadesh ke baad 4 kats ke saath film relies hui he
 Jolly LLB 2 shooting in Lucknow Watch: Review from Lucknow: The story is from Lucknow, where the story is based in Lucknow where lawyer Jagdishwar Mishra alias Jolly (akshay Kumar) lives with his wife Pushpa Pandey (huma Qureshi) and child
 apane khushmijaaj nechar ke hisaab se jolly puure nyaayalay main femes he
 See who gets to the screening of 'jolly LLB 2'
 While he solves the English paper of school children and is a wife, on the other hand, he also jokes during a court case
 isaki vajah se justise sunderlaal treepathi (saurabh shukla) bhi kaaphi pareshaan hote hai
 Then the twist in the story comes when the case of Hina Siddiqui (sayani Gupta) comes before the court and in the story there is an entry of characters like Iqbal Qasim (manav Kaul), Inspector Singh (kumud Mishra) and the last case while fighting in the court Jolly is fronted by renowned lawyer Pramod Mathur (annu Kapoor)
 yah cese hina kaa he jo apane pati kii bel ke liye baar-baar court kaa darwaja khatkhataati he
 There is a case against 'jolly' in the Jaipur court too
 Why should you see the film? Subhash Kapoor's strong writing and efforts to focus on the important case is commendable

 - The cinematography and screenplay of the film is excellent
 film ke kai sikvence aise hai jo aapke chehre par muskaan le aate hai
 Weak Links - The story in the film goes from Lucknow to Benares and Jammu Kashmir which slows down the pace of the film
 - court main dharne kaa sikvence bhi kaaphi lanbaa khinchataa he jise chota kiya ja saktaa tha
 - First and second half are a bit slow
 ye raftaar behatar ho sakati thi
 - Court room drama is good and funny too
 lekin isamen flo nahin he
 The budget of the film is said to be around 78 crores, including the expectation of Akshay's film box office stuck in the law
