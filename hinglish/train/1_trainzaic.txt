 Sources say that three bjp's fire brand leaders Uma Bharti, Yogi Adityanath and Varun Gandhi did not attend the state executive meeting due to their displeasure with UPBJP president Keshav Prasad Maurya
 in teenon netaaon kaa kahana hai ki keshav prasad maury ne apni nai team main unke logon ko nahin rakhaa he

 According to sources, the Gorakhpur rally was just an excuse Yogi Adityanath refused to attend the meeting due to resentment

 After that, PM Modi rallied in Allahabad on 13 June and Gorakhpur on 22 July

 auskar 2018 ke liye bharat ko riprogent karne ke liye nominete hui newton ko lekar ek ke baad ek nae vivaad saamne aa rahe he
 It is being told based on the story of Iranian film 'secret Ballet'
 diarector anuraag kashyap ne newton ke saport main joardaar morcha kholaa hua he
 He proved through a Facebook post that Newton was not a copy of the Secret Ballet film
 anuraag kashyapane fasebuk main likhaa he -jo log newton ko sikret ballat kii copy maan rahe hai unhen ye pataa chalanaa chahie ki sikret ballat ke produsar marco mular kaa is par kya kahana he
 i took a copy of the film's link from Newton's directors and sent it to Marco Muller
 newton dekhne ke baad marco mular ne kaha, ye bahut hi sabhy film he, or yakeenan ye hamaari film kii kahani se churaai nahin gai he
 When i asked him if i could share this response on social media after watching his Newton film, he said clearly yes of course you can use my statement
 bataa den ki isse pehle bhi anuraag kashyap newton ke saport main utre the
 He tweeted and said - 'newton' from 'secret Ballet' is as inspired as 'the Avengers' (hollywood film) from 'watan's Keeper'
 unhone kaha, 'newton' ko berlin filmotsav main puraskaar diya gaya tha or main ye vaada kar saktaa hum ki vahaan ke curator ek saal main itani filmein dekhte hai, jitani ham apni puri jindagi main nahin dekhte
 The film, starring Rajkumar Rao, revolves around a government employee who is struggling to monitor polling in the Maoist-affected area of chhattisgarh, while 'secret Ballet' tells the story of a woman polling officer who one day The people of Iran go to a remote area to agree to vote
 Newton is an award winner from Berlin Fest and i can promise you those curators watch more films in a year than rest of us do in a lifetime
 - Anurag Kashyap (@ anuragkashyap72) September 24, 2017 "newton" is as much a copy of "secret Ballot" as The Avengers is of Watan Ke Rakhwale — Anurag Kashyap (@ anuragkashyap72) September 24, 2017 That day when you wake up to the news that a deserving film makes a deserving box office
 
 Newton Shines
 
 super happy
 
 - Anurag Kashyap (@ anuragkashyap72) September 24, 2017 Not only this, since Newton is outpacing the rest of the Bollywood movies released at the box office, many controversies related to the film are coming up
 pehle ise sikret ballat film kii kahani copy bataaya gaya tha or haal hi main film ke poster ko bhi sathyajith re kii film ganashatru se miltaa-julata kaha gaya
 Oscar-winning Satyajit Ray's film Ganashtru came out in 1990
 bataaya jaataa he ki is film kii kahani kii prerana re ko norge ke rangakarmi henrik ibasan ke naatak se mili thi
 Well, despite all these controversies, Newton is getting a lot of love from the audience
 ab aage dekhnaa ye he ki auskars 2018 main ye film kya bharat ko jeet dilaa paati he yaa nahin
 
 desh main phir se modi sarkaar bananaa lagbhag tay he
 In the trends, BJP seems to get a strong majority
 centre main modi sarkaar kii vaapasi se karnataka kii congress-jedies sarkaar par khatre ke badal mandaraane lage hai
 Former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda has asked his CM son HD Kumaraswamy to think about his resignation
 haalanki, kumaraswami ne istipha dene se inkaar kar diya he
 CM Kumaraswamy said that he will fight it, but will not resign
 siem ne kasee venugopal se phone par baat bhi kii or unhen aage kii ranneeti banane ke liye bengalur aane kaa nyauta diya he
 KC Venugopal told the CM not to worry and the Congress is with him and the alliance should continue
 kumaraswami ne congress netaa dike sivakumar se baat bhi kii jo australia main hai
 Shivkumar also assured that the alliance would be fine
 siem ne mukhya sachiv se kal sabhi mantriyon ko anaupchaarik baithak main bhaag lene ke liye baat kii
 Congress high command asked CM Kumaraswamy not to take any decision in haste
 karnataka kii 225 vidhansabha siton main bijepi ko 104, congress ko 78, jedies ko 37, basapa ko 1, kepijepi ko 1 or anya ko 2 siton par jeet mili thi
 In this way no party had got a majority figure
 bijepi rajya kii sabase badi party hone ke naate bies yediurppa ne mukhyamantri kii shapath lee, lekin congress-jedies ke ek saath aane se vah bahumat sabit nahin kar paae
 After this, Congress formed Kumaraswamy government in the state with support to JDS
 karnataka main lagaataar kumaraswami kii sarkaar par sankat ke badal chhaae hue hai
 BJP ran Operation Lotus thrice against him, but he failed
 ab mana ja rahaa he ki centre main sarkaar banane ke baad bijepi phir oparation lotus chalaaegi or is baar bada khel ho saktaa he
 The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) has said that Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav is laying thorns in the path of his son and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav
 vihip ne kaha, "mulaayam kaa kaal ab samaapt ho chukaa he, lekin vah apane bete akhilesh ke aane vaale bhavishya kii raah main kaante hi bo rahe hai, jiskaa nateeja bahut bura hoga
 " churaasi kosi parikrama ko lekar vihip ke rashtriya pravaktaa prakaash sharma ne kaha ki sarkaar ke bheetar santon ko rokane kaa saahas nahin he
 If the government will stop the saints, it will also have to be prepared to suffer very serious consequences
 santon ko roke jane ke baad yah andolan sirf uttar pradesh kaa na hokar puure desh main failega or uski jimmedaari sarkaar kii hogi
 The comments sharma se yah puche jane par ki vihip nai parampara kii shuruyaat karne par kyon adig he, to unhone kaha, parampara nai nahin he
 There is no set date for the tradition of saints
 id ke maukey par sarkaar un saikadon masjidon ko bhi khulawaati he, jo lambey arase se band rahi hai or 100 yaa 200 kii sankhya me sant yadi parikrama karnaa chaahate hai, to vah itani baichaiyn kyon he
 Sharma said, the VHP has not been involved in Amarnath's yatra for a long time
 lekin kya kal ko yadi vihip yatra kaa faisla karti he, to use yah kahkar nahin hone diya jayega ki yah nai parampara kii shuruyaat he
 He said, "honestly, Mulayam's time has come to an end
 unhone apane samay main karsevakon par goli chalavaai thi, or unako uskaa parinaam bhi bhugatna padaa
 Now he is teaching his son the same, which is not auspicious sign for his future

 haal hi main vivek oberoi dwaara share kiya gaya ek mim khub viral ho rahaa he jisane nae vivaad ko tool de diya he
 Vivek has shared a meme on Twitter which has a photo collage
 pehle main aishwarya, salmaan ke saath najar aa rahi hai
 In the second, Aishwarya's pair can be seen with Vivek while in the third picture Aishwarya is with her daughter Aaradhya and husband Abhishek
 is mim ko ek joke se joda gaya he jo logon ko zyada pasand nahin aayaa he
 It clearly shows that Vivek has attacked Aishwarya's personal life
 tamaam celibrities or twitor yujar apana virodh jataa rahe hai
 However Vivek's reaction has also come to this and from his perspective he has done nothing wrong
 saath hi maafee maangane se bhi inkaar kar diya he
 This was the case, now let us know what is the story between Aishwarya, Salman and Vivek and what exactly was the dispute that had a bad effect on Vivek's career
 jab kareeb the salmaan-aishwaryaham dil de chuke sanam wo film jisane salmaan khan or aishwarya raay ke relationships kii neenv rakhi thi
 While working together in this film of Sanjay Leela Bhansali, both came close to each other and the news of affair between the two was echoed in the film corridors
 magar baad main halaat ek jaise nahin rahe
 It is said in many reports that Aishwarya kept distance from Salman due to his strict attitude
 saal 1999 se shuru hua pyaar kaa ye rishta bahut lanbaa nahin chalaa or saal 2002 tak aate aate ye rishta mahaj ek dastaan bhar banakar rah gaya
 Vivek Oberoi also has an aspect in this story
 Haha! 👍 creative! No politics here

 com / 1rpbbxzu8t— Vivek Anand Oberoi (@vivekoberoi)may 20, 2019jab bich main aae vivekiske baad aishwarya kii jindagi main vivek oberoi ne dastak di
 Vivek Oberoi was a young artist in those days and liked people
 donon ne saath main kyon ho gaya naa film main saath kaam kiya
 During this time, reports of both of them coming close
 magar ye khabar bhi zyada dinon tak nahin tik saki
 Suddenly, Vivek Oberoi did something that not only ruined his career, but his relationship deteriorated from both Salman Khan and Aishwarya Rai
 vivek ne jari kii press conferencevivek oberoi ne sabhi ko chaunkaate hue ek press conference rakhi or kaha ki salmaan khan, aishwarya raay ko daraate dhamkaate hai or daaru ke nashe main un par waar karte hai
 Salman's reaction to this accusation of Vivek imposed on Salman was bound to be tough, but Vivek's relationship with Aishwarya also got cracks
 salmaan buree tarah se vivek se khafa ho gaye or unhone vivek se kabhi baat nahin kii
 Though realizing his mistake, Vivek apologized to Salman and has been asking till date, but Salman is adamant on his decision
 vahiin aishwarya kii dooriyaan bhi vivek sang hamesh-hameshaa ke liye bad gayi or aish ne vivek sang brallep kar liya
 Ash went ahead in her life, married Aishwarya and Abhishek Bachchan in the year 2007
 is shaadi se unki aradhya naam kii beti bhi he
 Talking about the matter, there has been no response from the Bachchan family on this
 naa hi salmaan kii taraf se koi bayaan aayaa he
 But if something like this happens, the difficulties of conscience can increase

 Political parties in Maharashtra continue to celebrate Ajit Pawar NCP chief Sharad Pawar's nephew in Maharashtra's war of power has revolted and formed government with BJP
 iske baavjood ensipi ke tamaam netaa ajit pavaar ko manaane main jute hai
 In such a situation, the stakes of Sharad Pawar's return to Ajit Pawar are being taken under political compulsion or political plan is being laid under a thoughtful strategy
 maharashtra kii siyasat aise mode par aakar khadi ho gai he ki koun kya siyaasi daanv chal rahaa he
 Political pundits are also failing to guess this
 aise main ajit pavaar ke bagawati daanv se congress-ensipi-shivasena gathbandhan ko baikfoot par laakar khadaa kar diya he to bijepi bhi uljhan main fansi hui he
 In such a situation, veteran leaders of NCP along with Ajit Pawar are churning in the assembly
 ajit pavaar ko chagan bhujabal or jayant patil jaise bade ensipi netaa manaane main jute hai
 Jayant Patil, who was elected the leader of the new NSP legislative party after the rebellion of Ajit Pawar, has publicly invited Ajit Pawar to return
 jabaki nawab malik ne kaha he ki ajit pavaar se galati ho gai he, unhen istipha de dena chahie
 NCP leader Nawab Malik has claimed that 53 out of 54 mlas are united
 ajit pavaar ne galati kii he or galati sudhaarney ke liye ve turant istipha den
 He said that the BJP government does not have a majority
 ajit pavaar or devendra fadanvis ko istipha dena chahie
 Resign before being insulted, otherwise the government will be brought down on the floor of the House
 chagan bhujabal bhi ajit pavaar se mileensipi ke ek or bade netaa chagan bhujabal ne bhi ajit pavaar se mulaakaat kii

 According to sources Toshrad Pawar and Supriya Sule have also talked to Ajit Pawar's brother Srinivas
 ensipi is koshish main he ki ajit pavaar fadanvis sarkaar main dipti siem ke pad se istipha den
 Actually, NCP chief Sharad Pawar is such a respected leader of the politics, who knows when and what political bets will come
 in siyaasi uthapatak ke bich sharad pavaar ne pehali baar khulaasa karte hue kaha ki hamane shivasena se dhai-dhai saal mukhyamantri pad kii maang kii thi, lekin is masale par matbhed tha
 No consensus was reached
 isi ke chalate yah sara siyaasi ulatpher hua he
 However, Sharad Pawar also said that Ajit Pawar's decision to go with BJP was personal
 maine shivasena ko samarthan dene kaa vaada kiya he or main apane vaade ko puraa karuunga
 So, is this the reason why NCP is beating hands for the return of Ajit Pawar? At the same time, Maharashtra Deputy CM Ajit Pawar had tweeted on Sunday, 'I am in NCP and will always be in NCP and Sharad Pawar Saheb is our leader
 ' isi ke baad ensipi ke diggaj netaa ajit pavaar kii ghar vaapasi ke liye manaane main jute hai

 Union Home Minister p Chidambaram is on a tour of Lalgarh and Midnapore areas of West Bengal today
 
 In these areas, they are reviewing the anti-naxal operation Green Hunt
 chidambaram ravivaar ko lalgarh police stesan pahunche
 Apart from this, after visiting the CRPF camp and a health center there, he will go to Midnapore
 khabar he ki lalgarh main unhone suraksha gheraa todakar gaanvvaalon se mulaakaat kii auki baatcheet kii
 On the one hand, Chidambaram met the people, on the other he was opposed
 ilaake ke daure par chidambaram ke pahunchane se pehle maovadi sanghathan pisipie (pipuls cameti against police atrocities) ke samarthakon ne unke putale jalaae
 Maoists also burnt effigies of Manoj Verma, SP of West Midnapore
 unka aarope he ki sarkaar vikaas ke mudde se munh mode rahi he
 The Maoists have demanded the removal of security forces from the area and to end Operation Green Hunt
 lalgarh ke daure ke baad chidambaram ne saaf kaha ki naksaliyon ke khilaaf sena kaa istemaal nahin hoga
 According to Chidambaram, only the state police and paramilitary forces will carry out the operations against the Naxalites
 ye puche jane par ki is samay naksali thodaa shant hai , iskaa kya matlab nikaala jaae
 Chidambaram said that the Maoists may be regrouping and hence they need to be monitored
 naksaliyon ke khilaaf abhiyaan par chidambaram ne kaha ki iske kuch achche nattejey aae hai lekin ab bhi kuch kamajoriyaan hai
 Home Minister p Chidambaram, who visited the Naxalite affected areas of West Bengal, has put forward a fresh proposal for talks with the Maoists, refusing to include the army in the anti-maoist campaign
 sthiti kii samiksha karne ke liye lalgarh kii yatra par gaye chidambaram ne mukhyamantri buddhadev bhattacharya se vaarta ke dauraan kaha ki is sambandh main kanoon or vyavastha behaal karne kii jimmedaari rajya sarkaar kii he
 Chidambaram described the Naxalites as 'cowards', who are hiding in the forests
 unhone naksaliyon kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki ve pipuls cameti against police atrocities (pisipie) kii aad main apni gatividhiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 The PCPA has appealed for a 24-hour bandh in West Midnapore, Purulia and Bankura to protest Chidambaram's visit
 pradesh ke shisharsth police or prashasnic adhikariyon ke saath baithak ke baad chidambaram ne patrakaron se kaha ‘nahin, ham naksaliyon ke khilaaf sainya karrwai kaa vichaar nahin kar rahe
 Only state police, state armed police and paramilitary forces will be deployed to counter the naxalites
 ’chidambaram ne kaha ‘naksaliyon ko hamane vaarta ke liye nyauta diya, lekin iske pehle ve hinsa choden
 If they really want development, if they really want to solve people's problems, they are welcome to talk
 ’ unhone kaha ‘maine unase kaha ki ham duniya kii kisi bhi cheez par baat kar sakate hai, lekin unhen hinsa chhodani chahie
 Expressing concern over any direct or indirect cooperation by the PCPA to the Naxalites, he said that if he really had a problem, he would use his position to ensure dialogue between the state government and them
 grih mantri ne kaha ki unhone dar ke kaaran maovadiyon kaa saath dene vaale graminon se bhi apil kii ki ve aisa na karen
 He said, 'I appealed to him not to give any kind of cooperation to the Naxalites
 naksalwadi logon ke liye kisi tarah kaa vikaas nahin kar sakate
 'chidambaram also agreed that the villagers have reasons to be dissatisfied due to lack of development
 chidambaram ne kaha ‘maine unase kaha ki naksali aapako maar rahe hai or aapako lagaataar maarthe rahenge
 They have no place in society
 ’ chidambaram ne sanyukt balon ke naksal virdohi abhiyaan ke parinaam ko ‘mishrit’ kii sangya dete hue kaha ki kuch ‘kamiyon’ ko dur karnaa jaruri he
 Chidambaram said that intelligence reports indicated that the Naxalites are constantly reorganizing and they need to be constantly monitored to fight against them
 grih mantri ne kaha ki pashchim bengal or urisa evam jharkhand main naksal virdohi abhiyaan lambey samay pehle shuru hone vaala abhiyaan tha or aage bhi naksalwadiyon ko haraane main do se teen saal kaa samay lag saktaa he
 Chidambaram said, 'there is no ready answer for this
 ’ maowad prabhavit ilaakon se sanyukt balon kii vaapasi kii sambhaavna ko nakaarte hue unhone kaha ki maovadi virdohi abhiyaan jari rahegaa
 The Home Minister said, "will there be any use to withdraw the joint forces?" It is a long running process and will take two to three years to complete
 aapako dhairya rakhana hoga
 Chidambaram had commented that the entire responsibility stops at the Chief Minister's Office, to which he said that the Chief Minister must instead ensure that the responsibility stops at the office of the Superintendent of Police and the Officer of the Station House
 unhone kaha ‘agar jimmedaari kahin ja kar na ruke, to yah prashasnic tantra kii vifaltaa he
 In the context of PCPA, Chidambaram said that the organization was formed on November 2, 2008 on the issue of police atrocities
 chidambaram ne prashn uthaaya ‘yah sanghathan police nrushansataaon ke khilaaf bana tha
 Now why is it acting as a cover for the Maoists? Why is the PCPA supporting the Maoists directly or indirectly? ' He said, 'if he has any kind of trouble, then i am willing to use my position to arrange a dialogue with his state government
 ’ grih mantri ne kaha ‘nrushansata he yaa nahin, is baat par charchaa ho sakati he, lekin naksaliyon kii madad karnaa bahut badi galati he, jo ve kar rahe hai
 On the other hand he said that the villagers have reasons to be dissatisfied as they do not have facilities related to education, health, electricity and ration
 iske pehle chidambaram subah lagbhag 08
 Came here in a BSF helicopter from Kolkata on 05th
 unhen ek bullate pruf car main helipad se lalgarh ke police thane le jaaya gaya
 Regarding the media reports of Maoist top leader Kishenji getting well, he said, "the police told me that he does not agree that Kishenji gave an interview
 police nishchit taur par or kaam kar sakati he or sach khoj nikaalegi
 In reference to the PCPA, Chidambaram said that his jailed leader Chhatradhar Mahato and his brother Asit Mahato are not doing good for the people by helping the Naxalites
 ’ chidambaram ne sabhi partiyon ke netaaon ko salaah di ki ve lalgarh jaaen or graminon se baat karen
 Talking about Maoist violence, he said, 'west Bengal has a mixed record and the situation should improve
 ’ chidambaram ne kaha ‘pashchim bengal main kuch phaayde hue hai, lekin kuch kamajoriyaan hai
 It will take time to improve the situation in Orissa and Jharkhand and this is a problem
 ’ grih mantri ne kaha ki maharashtra ke gatchiroli or andhrapradesh ke kai bhaagon main sthiti main kaaphi sudhaar he
 Last year in Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, the killer who filed a report of the son's disappearance turned out to be his killer
 usne apane avaidh sambandhon main baadhak ban rahe putr kii hatya ke liye 10 lakh rupye kii supaari di thi

 i hope that my body will recover in time and i will be fully fit to play (ranji Trophy)
 maine net satr shuru kiye hai, lekin main abhi match feet nahin hum
 Saha was repatriated after playing his first Test match of the year in Cape Town, South Africa, due to a hamstring strain

 According to a new survey, BJP can become the number one party in the state with 27 percent votes
 yah survey sienen-ibien, da hindu or siesdis ne milakar kiya he
 According to the survey, the BSP will suffer the most
 uske vot pichhali baar kii tulana main 8 fisadi ghatakar 21 fisadi rah jaaenge
 While SP will get 23 and Congress will get 16 per cent votes
 bijepi kii vaapasi main agadi jatiyaan ahm role nibhaaengi, jo isse pehle baari-baari bispi or espi ke paksh main rah chuki hai
 The second important reason would be disillusionment with the Akhilesh government
 survey kii maane to khud espi ke 67 fisadi voter puri tarah yaa aanshik rup se yah chaahate hai ki siem kii kursi ab akhilesh ke bajaae unke pita mulaayam ko sanbhaalani chahie
 However, 23 per cent of the people polled did not say whom they would vote for

 is baat kii andekhi nahin kii ja sakati ki sarv main shaamil 23 fisadi logon ne apane pattey nahin khole hai
 The role of small parties has also been ignored in the survey

 This will depend to a large extent on how the BJP uses the Modi card

 In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, both BJP and Congress got 18 percent votes
 lekin bijepi ko 10 siten or congress ko 21 siten milin
 The BSP had the highest vote share, but it stood at number three despite 28 percent votes
 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main, espi ne 403 main se 224 siten apane naam kin
 His vote percentage was 29
 13
 BSP was barely three points behind in terms of vote percentage, but got just 80 seats

 ganga main lage kharboozo ko todane ke liye mirzapur ke teen bachche ghar se chupchaap ganga main pahunche to vah zyada gaharaa pani hone ke kaaran ganga main dub gaye
 Seeing the children drowning, there was a pledge
 People somehow jumped out of the Ganges and took out the children, but by then all three children had died
 himalay kii sabase oonchi chotii everest par vijay pataakaa fahraane vaali arunima sinha junun ko everest se bhi bada manati hai
 It is his passion, which enabled him to touch the height of Everest despite not having a left leg
 pesh he, unki bahaduree or kamyaabi kii daastaan unheen kii jubaanih'main safalataa ke aasmaan par hum, everest ke upar hum
 i have got what i have wished for
 mere pairon ne bhi meraa puraa saath diya
 What happened is i don't have my own left leg
 paraye pair ne paraepan kaa ahsaas tak nahin hone diya
 What a foot, i would have been here even if i had nothing else
 oonchai hi mujhe pukaarti he, mere buland iraadon ko koi chhu bhi nahin saktaa, mujhe koi roak bhi nahin saktaa
 i wanted to play volleyball-football, wanted to be a hockey champion, but my cut leg prevented me from going to rules tied to the law
 log kehete hai ki kanoon pairon main bandhi hui bediyon ke samaan hote hai, mere paas to ek pair bhi nahin tha, lekin parvat par chadhane se mujhe koun roak saktaa tha
 When i first expressed my heartfelt desire to conquer Everest, what a joke people had made
 aaj ve hi log dekh len ki main kahaan par hum
 Hey, if you would have got the floor by walking on your feet, then billions of people would have reached their floors, it is encouraging that you can reach anywhere
 jaise main aaj yahaan par hum shwet barf se dhaki pahadiyon or svachh nile akaash ke neeche, jai bajrangbali!naam meraa he arunima sinha
 i am also called Sonu
 main bahut prasiddh nahin hum lekin do saal pehle mere saath jo haadasa hua tha, usase mujhe pahchaan mili
 That identity was not of any good faith nor did i do any good
 vah badanaami thi
 But what was my fault? i belong to Kshetrana (shajadpur) locality in Ambedkar Nagar district of Uttar Pradesh
 sach to yah he ki ham log mulat: bihar ke hai
 Father was in the army and we had come to Sultanpur
 lekin jab main chaar saal kii thi, tabhi mere pitaaji kaa swargvaas ho gaya
 i have a younger brother and older sister Lakshmi
 aap samaj sakate hai ki bina pita ke parivaar kii kya haalat hoti he
 My mother came to Ambedkaranagar and got a job in the health department
 kisi tarah jivan kii gaadi aage badhane lagi
 i too was sent to school to study, but i used to feel more into playing, in our society, girls have a tradition of mastering the housework, girls are rarely seen playing
 logon ne manaa bhi kiya lekin main kahaan maanane vaali thi
 My mother also did not interrupt me and didi Lakshmi like my mother used to stand behind me like a wall
 maine footbal, wollyboul or hockey kheli
 When the boy came out with a stick to play hockey, where are the boys from the neighborhood
 ve meri khilli udaate the
 They used to say, look, you are going to play as a queen of Jhansi, carrying a big eye stick
 main vaise to ladakon kii parvaah bhi nahin karti thi, lekin jab baat akharane vaali lagati thi to main ghurkar unki taraf dekhati thi, to ve udan chhu ho jate the
 i remember that once i would be 14 years old and both our sisters were going somewhere by bicycle, then Lakshmi didi stopped at one place and started talking to someone and i went ahead and waited for her there
 us dauraan kuch ladke cycle se udhar se gujarey to mujhase rasta chhodane ko kaha
 i refused and said that there is a place ahead, get out of there
 ve apni baat par ade rahe or main apni baat par
 Meanwhile, when Lakshmi didi came and we started walking, a boy slapped me, which hit my sister's cheek
 bheed kaa laabh uthaakar ladke bhaag gaye
 i was very angry to see the sister on the cheek
 maine didi se kaha ki chalo us ladke ko dhundhakar sabak sikhaate hai
 Sister refused but Chandi was riding on me
 ham donon un ladakon ko kaaphi der tak talashte rahe or gum-phir kar usee jagah aa gaye
 Seeing the collar of a boy's shirt standing at the paan shop there, Didi said that this is the boy
 bas phir kya tha, maine daudkar us ladke ko daboch liya or didi se kaha, 'maar didi, chhodana nahin
 'there was a crowd, there was a lot of ruckus but i did not leave
 ant main us ladke ke ghar vaale aae or maafee maangi tab jaakar maine use choda
 After that, no one looked at me or towards my sister
 lakshmi didi kii shaadi ho gai lekin mere prati unka itnaa pyaar rahata he ki vah sasuraal se zyada maayke main hi rahati hai or meri or meri maa-bhai kii madad karne ke liye hameshaa jaan die rahati hai
 My brother-in-law Om Prakash ji is like a god to us
 bajrangbali ne unhen jaise hamaare liye hi banaaya tha
 His shadow has helped me fulfill my dream
 maine inter kiya, elelbi kiya lekin khelnaa mere liye junun ke samaan hi tha
 i played volleyball-football in the surrounding districts, won many awards, but my passion kept growing
 maine rashtriya str par bhi khelon main bhaag liya lekin mujhe meraa haq nahin mila
 i had hands and feet, passion but no ladder, no roof that would let me move forward, keep me safe
 maine sochaa ki kahin par naukari kar luun taaki usee ke saath aage badhati jaaun
 Put forms in many places
 siaisef main bhi koshish kii or ek din noida main siaisef ke daftar main jane ke liye ghar se nikal padi, akeli
 The day was 11 April 2011
 mujhe nahin maaloom tha ki meri duniya badalane ja rahi he
 Sitting on a seat by the side of the window in the running compartment of the Padmavati Express train, in the dark of night, looking for a light like firefly that some 'loafer type' boys came and they swooped on the chain lying around my neck
 mujhe hansi aa gai
 What is the point of these boys taking away my thing from me? i held the boy's hand and jerked it
 lekin tabhi duusare ladke ne mere gale main haath daalaa to mere gardan hataa lene par uske haath main chen kii jagah meri shart kaa kaaler aa gaya
 He dragged him by holding the collar and two-three boys caught me and pulled him near the door
 mere liye unase nibatna mushkil kaam nahin tha lekin tabhi ladakon ne mere upar aisi laat maari ki main chalati train se baahar gittiyon ke bich lotati si najar ai
 
 pataa nahin kya hua, mujhe kuch pataa nahin ki mere pair ke upar se train ke kitne pahie guzarate chale gaye
 Were they the wheels of the Padmavat Express or the trains passing over the other tracks? At that time it was half past one and the train was near Bareilly
 lekin kuch sochane-samajhane se pehle dard ke aaveg ne mujhe besudh kar diya
 When i would break my sleep in between, i would see that i was lying on the side of the train tracks, i had a leg cut off, just some meat had kept it attached to my body
 bagal kii patari se rah-rahakar trainen guzar rahi thim
 The distance between the track and me was only a few inches
 main apane ko patari se dur karnaa chaahati thi lekin mere paas itnaa dam kahaan tha, us par bheeshan dard
 i lay in that rugged night the same way
 jab mujhe hosh aata to bajrangbali ko yaad karke yahi kahati ki jai bajrangbali
 What is happening with my life, and what is left to happen now? Sometimes a picture of a mother came in front of her eyes, sometimes brother, sometimes Lakshmi didi and sometimes brother-in-law
 pau fatne par jab log shouch ke liye railway kii patariyon kii taraf aae to mujhe padaa paaya
 The villagers came
 meraa naam-pataa poocha
 Perhaps in the faint sense i had told the telephone number of the house
 jija ne unase kaha ki itani madad or kar dijie ki arunima ko kisi aspataal tak panhucha dijie
 i was taken to the hospital around 7 am
 meri bain taang kaat di gai
 i was admitted to the trauma center in Lucknow after the media made noise
 vahaan se phir mujhe ames le jaaya gaya
 The doctors saved me
 siaiesaf ne naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The then Railway Minister Mamta Banerjee also announced the job
 tatkaaleen khel mantri ajay maakan ne kaaphi raahaten deen
 The society did not digest these things
 ilaaj ke saath hi vivaad bhi shuru ho gaya ki main rashtriya str kii khilaadi nahin hum
 i have not even passed Inter
 main kisi ke saath bhaag rahi thi
 i am married
 maine kisi pratiyogita main bhaag nahin liya
 i am a liar, a fraud
 upi ke ediji rail e
 K
 jain ne to baqayada press conference karke mujhe jhootha sabit kiya or kaha ki maine train se kudakar aatmahatya kii koshish kii thi yaa phir main us behad sunsaan ilaake main akele aadhi raat ko railway line paar kar rahi thi, jab yah durghatana ghati
 i got angry

 Calling Jain a lot, he told me that if one of your soldiers was present in the train, he would tell that there was no attempt to rob me in the train that day
 Did GRP help me despite being on the tracks overnight? i used to think that i a
 ke
 Go to Jain and face him
 ames main meri maa, meri bahan or jija ne mujhe samajhaayaa ki or ladakiyon ke saath kya-kya nahin hota, log tejaab tak daal dete hai, tumhaara to bas ek pair hi gaya he, ab aage kii yojana banaao
 Sister's inspiration brought to my mind that i should do something that the world sees
 kyon na everest par chadh jaaun? bina pair ke everest par chadhana hi mujhe sabase behatar vichaar laga
 This is the real challenge
 aasaan kaam to har koi kar letaa he
 Made it easy for me rakesh shrivastav or unke bhai shailesh shrivastav ne jo innovative naam se ek sanstha chalaate hai
 They made a prosthetic leg for me which i wear
 mujhe ajay maakan ne itani sahuliyatein deen or vah bhi tab, jab uttar pradesh kii sarkaar mujhe mulgim bataane ke liye utaaru thi or media mere peeche pad gaya tha
 Players' organization 'sai' did not even consider me as a player
 main cheekh-cheekh kar kaha karti thi ki 'main jinda hum, mujhase aakar pucho, main juthi nahin hum
 'but the troubles and ordeals were not yet over
 chaar maheene ames main gujaarne ke baad jab main waapas lauti to meri badanaami meraa peechha kar rahi thi
 i got a certificate of disability and also a pass by rail
 lekin mujhe train ke senkad class kii arakshit bogi main chalane ke liye tikat nahin miltaa tha
 i was run, suspected
 mere liye viklang bogi main chalanaa bhi apmaan ke kadave ghunt pine ke samaan hi tha
 RPF soldiers would see my leg openly and then ask for a pass and check it
 ek baar to haridwar main jab mujhe tikat nahin mila to stesan master ne bahut madad kii
 He asked the counter clerk to give him the ticket but he said that he suspected me of it
 usamen hastakshar thik nahin hai
 In the end, the station master forced me to board the train on my own
 mamata banerjee ne naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 When i reached the Ministry of Railways through artificial legs, their PA refused to join
 teen baar niraash hokar main laut ai
 When i somehow managed to meet Railway Board Chairman Vivek Sahai, i was surprised to hear his answer
 unhone saare kagajaat dekhe or phir kaha ki pehle jiarapy se badhiya si report lagavakar lao
 This was the humanism of the railway minister and chairman
 maine himmat nahin haari
 Said that i will show my strength to all of them, they will all recognize me and come to me on their own
 mujhe bachhendri paal ne kaaphi protsaahit kiya
 Due to his training, i am so close to the sky today
 main mount everest kii chotii par hum jahaan par har koi nahin panhuch paata he
 It seems that just raise my hand and touch it
 mujhe bukhaar aa gaya or neeche bhi lautnaa tha us duniya main jo nahin chaahati thi ki main yahaan tak pahunchun
 But there were some people who believed in me and i have reached here only because of them
 meri ichha apane jaise viklang logon kii madad karne kii he, jinhen samaaj thukraata he
 i want to build a sports academy for him, seven and a half bighas of land have been found in Unnao
 saadhe teen bigha or kharidni he
 When those who have high desires like me will come out of this academy, then i will feel that everything that happened to me was fine because if it had not happened, then who would be able to encourage the coming generation! i will turn 27 on the 10th of next month
 mujhamen abhi bahut si oonchaaiyon ko chune kaa hausala baaki he
 Just challenge me! supreme court sahaara samooh ke pramukh subrat roy kii yachika par somvaar ko sunwaayee karegaa

 purv kendriya mantri or congress netaa salmaan khurshid ne bharat or china ke bich tanaav badhane par chintaa jataate hue kaha ki sarkaar ko satark rahanaa hoga
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, Salman Khurshid said, 'this is a matter of concern
 aisa kyon ho rahaa he or yahaan tak baat kaise pahunchi, is par bahut saare sawaal hai
 But there is also the question of the identity and security of our country
 ham sirf itnaa hi kah sakate hai ki hamaari sarkaar ko satark rahane kii aavashyaktaa he, kisi dhokhe main nahin rahanaa he ek bahut badi jimmedaari he, bahut bada kartavya nibhaana he or jisamen sara desh saath degaa
 "the government is not serious! Salman Khurshid also alleged that the government is not serious in this matter
" unhone kaha, 'pradhanmantri aisesamay main baahar hai to kya sandesh bhejnaa he, kya karrwai ho rahi he, isaki jaankaree desh ko honi chahie
 It seems that the Prime Minister has been lost in Israel and he has been welcomed there and he has become completely lost
 yah unka apana nirnay he
 At this time, the Prime Minister and the government should give their full attention and full time to this problem
 chaati thokna or chillaanaa samajhadaari kii baat nahinunhone kaha ki is samay vishwa kii gambhir sthiti bani hui he
 It is not necessary for us that we also speak in the same language as China
 puri duniya main or america, china, bharat kaa trikon he
 Whose relations are formed, it will have a very wide and far reaching impact all over the world
 isliye badi samajhadaari or subut se kaam karne kii jarurat he, lekin yah bhi sahi he ki ham peeche nahin hat sakate hai
 Chest banging and shouting is also not very sensible
 25 saal kii mehnat ko kharaab na karensalmaan khurshid ne kaha, 'jab bhi aisa kuch hota he, samajhadaar log samaadhaan nikaalane kaa prayaas karte hai
 Let's try to cool the thing
 hamaare china ke sambandh bahut achche nahin the,rajivji ne jaakar ek baar phir se madhur sambandh karne kaa prayaas kiya
 The conversation started, we have moved forward to a great extent
 ab jo kuch bhi pichley bees 25 varshon main kii hui mehnat he, jisamen kuch paaya gaya he, china or bharat ke madhur sambandh bane he
 i do not think that should spoil it

 bijepi ke parshad chandani chowk main avaidh bazaar or avaidh atikaraman ke zarie moti kamai kar rahe hai
 This is the reason why BJP is putting obstacles in every development work

 We were constantly in touch with him
 vyapaariyon ne kaha tha ki wo abhi notebandi or jiesti kii maar vyapaaree jhel rahaa hai, isliye diwaali ke baad kaam shuru hona chahie
 Alka Lambane alleged that BJP leaders are now protesting under the guise of businessmen

 thanon main janmashtami ko lekar upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath dwaara die gaye bayaan par 'aaj tak' ke saath hui vishesh baatcheet main bijepi netaa vinay katiyaar ne apni raay vyakt kii
 He said, "what Yogi has said is right, i support him
" agar or bhi kadam uthaane padenge uthaae jaaenge, ham sab saath hai
 "vinay Katiyar said," Ever since Yogi became the Chief Minister, he has done many things
 main samajhataa hum ki hindu dharm ke liye wo aavashyak kadam uthaa rahe hai
 Earlier, Janmashtami was celebrated in the police station but due to the politics of appeasement, the Samajwadi Party government banned it and allowed to offer Namaz on the streets
 jaisaa chaaho vaisaa karo, updrav karo, narsanhaar karo or chhedchhad karne kii chhot de di or hamen janmashtami manaane par bhi roak ye thik nahin he
 Therefore, what Yogi has said is right, i support him
 agar or bhi kadam uthaane padenge uthaae jaaenge, ham sab saath hai
 "talking on the Kavad yatra, Vinaya Katiyarne said," Dhol, Nagara and Manjira ring in Kavad
 ye thik he kyonki sab log dur se aate hai
 This also leads to awakening
 is par bhi yogi ji ne thik kaha ki agar ye sab nahin bajenge to shmashaan yatra lagegi
 Yes, some people get intoxicated
 bhole ke bhakt hai, isamen koi aapatti nahin he
 Everyone is going to Bhole's court, everything goes there
 lekin sanyam se janaa chahie
 "speaking on loudspeakers in mosques," Katiyar said, "mosques did not have loudspeakers at first
 ab to masjidon main laudspikar kii baadh aa gai he
 Now they fight to install loudspeakers in mosques
 sampradayik dangakarne main masjidon se laudspikar kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 If Ajan is used then it is fine, but it is used for communal rioting
 jaise kahin bhi thodaa sa sampradayik tanaav hota he masjidon se aalha-hu-akbar ke naare lagaae jate hai
 Which increases stress
 laudspikar ko band karnaa chahie
 "vinay Katiyar continued," The Yogi government is working to strengthen both Hindus and Muslims
 ham kah rahe hai ki agar aap sadak par namaaj adaa karenge to janmashtami bhi manegi
 Ram Vanwas is over in UP
 yogi ji ram bhakton ke liye bhi kaam kar rahe hai
 "on the issue of triple divorce, Vinay Katiyar said," It is true that divorce is the work of oppressing women
 ye durbhagyapurna he isliye hamane virodh kiya
 The triple divorce case should be closed
 halaala puri tarah se khatm hona chahie
 Halala is the work of oppression
 halaala to apmaan karne kaa kaam he
 The maulvis have silver in it
 isamen mahila ko yatnaa sahani pad rahi he
 Why this triple divorce should apply in India
 hamane court main iskaa virodh kiya he
 If there is no divorce, there will not be halala
 ye puri tarah se galat he
 It should be closed
 agar court kaa nirnay tripal talaak ke khilaaf aayega to khushi hogi

 Commoner Luv Tyagi, who took entry as a neighbor in Bigg Boss 11's house, is strengthening his hold among the contestants
 ghar main mehjabeen, lucinda or sabyasachi ke saath padosi banakar rahane vaale lav kaa andaaj gharavaalon ko kaaphi acha lagata tha
 Despite the nomination, there has also been an appeal on social media for the escaped Love Tyagi
 padosi kaa unic andaaj aayaa pasandpadosi banakar gharavaalon se baat karne vaale lav kaa phone karke 'main aapkaa padosi bol rahaa hum' bolnaa logon ko or gharavaalon donon ko kaaphi pasand aata tha
 As a neighbor, Love's role was also important in planning against the family
 padosi bane lav ko sabhi phens jald se jald ghar main entry lete hue dekhnaa chaahate the
 As soon as Love entered the main house, his friends and relatives started posting photos of him on social media
 aisa lag rahaa tha ki lav koi celebrati hai
 Shilpa revealed, Pak said - Pak is also crazy about 'angoori Bhabhi'; Love fell silent as soon as she entered the house, after seeing the entry of the house, a different form of love was found
 After hearing the stories of Sabyasachi and Mehjabin, Love revealed about herself
 It is not considered necessary to tell anything
 mehjabeen or sabyasachi kii baton par saare gharavaalon ko vishwaas ho gaya tha lekin mastermind vikaas gupta ko unke saare jhooth pataa chal gaye
 Vikas not only exposed mehjabin but also exposed the lies of love
 jab ghar se do padosi lucinda or lav ko out karne kii baat ai to lav ne hindi jaanane ko phayda uthaaya or gharavaalon ko khud ko bachaane ke liye samajha liya
 After this, Love began to show his true colors and stopped carpeting with the family
 is baat ko salmaan khan ne bhi bolaa or is aadhaar par gharavaalon ne lav ko target karnaa shuru kar diya shivaay hina khan ke
 Bandh, out of Bigg Boss's house, weeping out, Punish's bad Halluva fame, when Jyoti Kumari and Luv Tyagi were in Bottom 2, then it seemed that Love would soon be homeless from home but it remains to be seen that Love Stayed in the house
 lav ke doston ne ek uske liye priyank or sapana ke saath risk liya or lav ko bachaa liya
 As a result, Sapna Chaudhary, a strong contender for the house, was out of the house
 iske baad se phens ke bich lav ne majboot pakad banaai or ab wo daavedaaron kii list main shaamil hai
 Bigg Boss will not get extension due to Salman, this is the reason, but will the love show win, when the bandh was out and Love got a lot of votes, then it was clear that Love will stay in the house
 last wyk main hue alimination main kaaphi chaunkaane vaala rigelt saamne aayaa tha jahaan majboot daavedaar hiten tejavaani ghar se baahar ho gaye the to vahiin shilpa ke baad lav sabase se zyada vot paane vaale duusare number ke contestant bane the
 Love Tyagi, who started with the turtle trick, seems to be a strong contender in the winner's race
 agar reports kii maane to ghar main baaki kaamanar vikaas, arshi or punish se zyada lav femes ho rahe hai
 So, does Love also come in the bid to win the show? a post shared by bipashabasusinghgrover (@bipashabasu) on Apr 8, 2018 at 2:33am PDTA post shared by karan singh grover (@iamksgofficial) on Jan 14, 2018 at 1:29am PST a passenger named Kaushik Chatterjee, who was traveling on the santragachhi-pune Express in Raipur, tweeted to Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu, complaining about the food being provided to him from Pantrikar

 After the complaint of the passenger, the Ministry of Railways asked the passenger for complete information in this matter
 khaane kii gunavaktaa isamen khaas thi
 The aggrieved passenger told that the Pantrikar employee took an order to eat at Raipur station
 jo use chaar ghante baad nagpur railway stesan ke pehle parosa gaya
 The lentils served in food and vegetable both smelled

 It seemed as if the onions and tomatoes served in the salad had not been washed
 jabaki usase thali kii puri rakam lee gai thi
 First, the Ministry sent a complaint to the Raipur DRM and directed the investigation
 haalanki shikaayat milane tak trainraipur mandalse aage nagpur rail mandal ke antargat aane vaale ilaake main daakhil ho chuki thi
 After this, the Ministry of Railways has sent the said complaint to IRCTC and directed to investigate the entire matter and take action

 antarrashtriya shram sanghathan kii ibaarat ke mutabik yon utpeedan sex ke maamle main stri-purush bhedbhaav kaa khaas rup he, jo mard-aurat ke bich takat ke gaiyr-baraabar rishte ko jaahir karata he
 The United Nations Treaty on the Elimination of all forms of discrimination against women (CEDAW) demands "measures to protect women from sexual harassment and other forms of violence or coercion at the workplace"
 yonutpeedan vibhinn roopon main ho saktaa he
 This may include oral or written forms such as dress, personal behavior or body commentary, sexual or gender-based lewdness, soliciting sexual favors or asking repeatedly to walk outside, sexual gestures, personal or sexual life This includes spreading rumors, threatening by sending e-mails or text messages of a sexual nature
 iskaa swaroop shaareerik ho saktaa he or hamale, kareeb aane yaa rasta rokane, gaiyr-vaazib dhang se chune, chuumane, aalingan karne, thapthapaane, haath pherane, sahalaane kii shakl le saktaa he
 This includes staring at the body from top to bottom, making and pursuing abusive gestures of sexual nature
 yon utpeedan ke drishy roopon main yon prakruti ke poster, drawing, tasviren, screensevar, i-mail yaa text saamne rakhana yaa saajha karnaa or yon uttejanaa paidaa karne vaala sangeet bajaanaa shaamil he
 The most important symptom of sexual harassment is that it is disliked and unwanted, is done frequently, often in favor of sex in favor of sex, and it creates unhealthy and hostile environment in the work
 yon utpeedan kii khabaren duniya bhar se aati rahati hai
 We keep reading a lot of reports, ranging from children in schools to sexual harassment in a variety of situations at workplaces
 zyaadaatar auraten yon utpeedan ko lekar khamosh rahati hai, baavjood iske ki iskaa manovaigyanik asar tabah karne vaala ho saktaa he
 Family pressures and future personal concerns (marriage and relationships) due to social stigma, possibly losing their jobs, poor future career prospects, real concerns about keeping it confidential, fear of embarrassment and slander But how often will it affect) Often, shy women stop complaining of sexual harassment or abuse
 aksar aisa hota he ki auraten shikaayat darj karwaane kii bajaae vah kaarysthal yaa shaikshanik santhaan hi chhod detii hai
 The result of suppressing these complaints comes in the form of the same stereotypes about the victimized woman that she was involved or responsible in some way or the other to promote the perpetrator, which makes the environment worse
 ek santhaan kii aantarik shikaayat samiti (isisi) ke adhyaksh ke taur par kaam karne or postagraduate shikshak hone ke naate in muddon ko lekar meri chintaaen kai sahuuliyat ke binduon se upji hai jinamein media or academik jagat bhi shaamil hai
 The first concern is the extent of awareness at all workplaces about what sexual harassment is and how they have the right to complain and correct it
 kaarysthal par mahila yon utpeedan (rokthaam, nishedh or sudhaar) adhinium 2013 jahaan kanoonee sahaara muhaiyaa karata he, vahiin aise utpeeda ke shikaar kai log apni shikaayatein lekar aage aane se hichakate hai
 Apart from social reasons, one of the biggest reasons behind this is the common concern that the name will be hoisted
 kanoon kaa takaza he ki isisi main likhit shikaayat darj karwaai jaae par bahut hi kam auraten likhit shikaayat darj karwaane ko taiyaar hoti hai
 a common belief is that most of these complaints are caused by old-fashioned pay-offs or when the relationship that is formed with consent becomes sour
 aisi vajahen apwaad swaroop hi hoti hai
 The law allows reconciliation, which means that if the accused agrees to abide by the complainant's fixed conditions (apologies, affidavits that that particular misconduct will not be repeated, agreement to seek help, etc
) Can be eliminated
 sudhaar ke upaay ke taur par yah mahatvapurn he, khaskar tab jab utpeedan isliye hua ho ki aaropee ko pataa nahin tha ki vah jo kar rahaa tha, vah asweekaarya or kanoon ke khilaaf tha
 This means that people should be made aware of how to say 'no' to unsolicited offers, how and when to recognize that the offer has been turned down and step back, and what is the boundary line of violation in professional relationships Can
 maansik swasthya peshewar hone ke naate main do buniyadi muddon par atak jaati hum
 The first is that between the changing attitudes of society, there is a lot of confusion among many men and women about what is the role of sex in an emotional relationship that is developing, what is mutual consent and what is bullying
 mahaj ek galat faisla aksar avaanchit nateezon ke silsile kaa sabab ban jaataa he
 Sexual activity at an early age is an important problem that can lead to many kinds of difficulties in later life
 lihaaja jimmedaari kaa boj shaikshanik sansthaanon or kaarysthalon par hi aa jaataa he, jo ho saktaa he ki aise muddon ko sanbhaalane ke liye puri taiyaar na hon
 There should be a mandatory ICC in all workplaces and educational institutions
 aakhir main, aisi tamaam shikayaton kii jaanch prakritik nyaay ke siddhanton kaa paalan karte hue karnaa jaruri he, taaki kisi bhi kism ke atyaachaar ko roka ja sake

 According to Rajya Sabha MP SS Ahluwalia, it is a strange coincidence that the Lok Sabha was dissolved when the Lokpal Bill came up for discussion in Parliament
 unhone kaha ki aisa 1968 se ho rahaa he
 The Lokpal and Lokayukta Bill was introduced on May 9 that year
 ise sansad kii chayan samiti ke paas bheja gaya tha
 In Lok Sabha, it was passed as Lokpal and Lokayukta Bill, 1969 on 20 August 1969
 baharhaal is vidheyak ke rajyasabha main paarit hone se pehle chauthi loksabhaa bhang ho gai or vidheyak bhi nirast ho gaya
 After this, the second Lokpal and Lokayukta Bill was introduced on 11 August 1971
 ise na to kisi samiti ko bheja gaya or na hi yah sadan main paarit hua
 With the dissolution of the fifth Lok Sabha, this bill also came to an end
 iske baad 28 july 1977 ko is aashay kaa vidheyak laayaa gaya
 It was referred to the Joint Select Committee of both the Houses of Parliament
 sanyukt pravar samiti kii anushansaaon se pehle hi chhathi loksabhaa bhang ho gai or saath hi vidheyak bhi khatm ho gaya

 For this, Rs 2,000 to 5,000 was borrowed from moneylenders on interest and was always buried under their debt
 lekin kuch saal pehle jab mujhe kisi ne kaha ki alkhar sosayadi bina byaaj ke rin detii he to hairaan ho gai
 He first took a loan of Rs 10,000 from the society to run the shop
 uske baad usne sosayadi se 20,000 rupee se 50,000 rupee tak rin liya
 Kamla said, 'I have opened a wholesale shop today by taking a loan from the society and expanding my business from a small Khomche shop

 Geeta said, 'my life changed after coming in contact with the Alkhar Society
 isane hamen sammaan kii jindagi jeene main madad kii
 For poor people like us, the interest-free loan is God's blessing
 yahaan bainkon kii tarah karj milane kii koi anischitata nahin hoti he
 'another beneficiary Sanjay Singh said that banks are not interested in giving loans to those running small shops
 unhone kaha, 'bank karj par byaaj to letaa hi he, saath hi karj lene ke liye itane saare dastavej bharne kii bhi jarurat hoti he jisase ki garib aadmi pareshaan ho jaataa he
 'sanjay has a small clothes shop, which is run by his wife and he sells clothes on a bicycle
 alkhar sosayadi se kareeb ek dashak se jude avkaash praapt bank adhikari samim rizvi ne bataaya, 'byajmukt karj bhale hi muslim parampara ho kyonki islam main byaaj ko anuchit mana jaataa he
 But it (alkhar Society) gives interest-free loans not only to Muslims but also people of all religions
 'alkhar sosayadi ke prabandh nideshak naiyar fatmi ne ieenes ko bataaya ki byajmukt karj kii ampasandi bad rahi he
 He said, 'for those who are not able to reach the bank, small amount of five to 10,000 rupees is also important

 On Wednesday, due to the Supreme Court's decision on Arunachal Pradesh, there was a round of chaos in the political corridors
 lekin ek sawaal jisane aam janata ke man main bhi ghar kar liya he, vah he ki aakhir arunachal kii kaman kiske haath hogi? kalikho pul SC ke faisle ke baad se mukhyamantri nahin rahe
 Nabam Tuki took over as Chief Minister late Wednesday evening but he does not have a majority
 sirf 5 maheenon ke andar hi kalikho pul nearunachal pradesh ke mukhyamantri ke taur par padganva diya
 Because the Supreme Court's decision asked to restore the situation like December 2015
 kai maheenon ke raajnneetik sankat se jujhane ke baad isi salfarvari main bijepike samarthan se arunachal pradesh main sarkaar bani thi
 Nabam Tuki has been reinstated as the Chief Minister of the state
 unhone apana kaam bhi shuru kar diya he
 But now the dispute between BJP and Congress about Arunachal may increase even more
 uttarakhand main haarane ke baad bijepi ab arunachal main apni pratishtha bachaane main juty hui he, saath hi congress bhi rajya main apni sarkaar bachaane main lagi hui he
 Because even though Nabam Tuki has become the Chief Minister, he will still have to prove his majority
 arunachal vidhansabha main 60 vidhayak hai or kisi ko bhi bahumat sabit karne ke liye 31 vidhayakon kaa samarthan hona jaruri he
 The special thing is that 20 mlas have rebelled in December only, angry with Nabam Tuki
 saath hi do kii sadsyta par pehle hi hoicourt sawaal uthaa chukaa he
 Arunachal Pradesh has become very interesting at the political level
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki ye ladaai aakhirkaar koun jitegaa

 Imran said - Mistakes from both the countries
 Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said in the program that i saw happiness in the Sikh community if i could explain to the Muslims that as Muslims stand 4KM away from Medina and they cannot go there
 lekin ab ye sapana puraa hua he, iske liye ham lagaataar kaam kar rahe hai
 You will be happy when you come here next year

 And always the other player would become the champion, the player afraid of losing would never become big
 'kab tuutegi zanjeer'imran khan ne kaha ki jab main siyasat main aayaa to aise log se mila jo bas apane liye hi kaam karte the, awam ko bhul jate the
 If there is another type of politician, he used to do politics in the name of work, not in the name of haters
 unhone kaha ki aaj jahaan pakistan-hindustan khadaa he, 70 saal se aisa hi ho rahaa he
 He said that there were mistakes on both sides, but the chain will not be broken unless we move forward
 'france-germany ek saath to bharat-pak kyon nahin'unhone kaha ki ham ek kadam aage badhkar do kadam peeche hat jate hai, ye takat nahin ai he ki kuch bhi ho ham rishte thik karenge

 unhone kaha ki agar hindustan ek kadam aage badhayega to ham do kadam aage badhayenge
 "there cannot be a war between the two countries" Imran Khan said that when Sidhu went back the last time, he was severely criticized, but what is the crime of a person who has brought the message of peace
 hamaare donon ke paas atomi hathiyaar he, to inke bich jang ho hi nahin sakati he
 To think of war between the two countries is insane
 unhone kaha ki agar siddhu pakistan main chunaav lard len to wo jeet sakate hai
 He said that we should not wait for Sidhu to become the Prime Minister
 ham chaahate hai ki donon mulkon ke bich main aman ho
 Navjot Singh Sidhu looted during the foundation stone of Kartarpur Sahib Corridor in Pakistan, Navjot Singh Sidhu said that Hindustan Jeeva, Pakistan Jeeva
 unhone kaha ki mujhe koi dar nahin, meraa yaar imran jiven
 Sidhu said that everyone will have to change their mind, only then peace will prevail
 unhone kaha ki ab khun-kharaba band hona chahie, dosti kaa paigaam aage badhanaa chahie
 Much damage has been done so far
 siddhu ne kaha ki kartarpur coridor donon deshon ke logon ke bich main sampark badhayega, jo sampark tutaa hua tha wo ab dobaaraa jud rahaa he
 Whenever the history of Kartarpur Corridor will be written, Imran Khan's name will be written on the front page
 unhone kaha ki bantwaare ke dauraan do punjab tut gaye the, aaj imran jaisi koi chaabi aani chahie ki inhen jodna chahie

 The work has been completed by the person whose service was written
 guru nanak sahab ne apana aakhri samay aapaki dharti par bitaayaa, lekin 4 kimi
 It took 70 years to complete this gap
 unhone kaha ki yahaan meraa koi dost, koi jaanane vaala nahin lekin ek sikh hone ke naate meri aradaas puri hui he
 Harsimrat Badal became emotional while saying his words
 hamaari party 7 maheene se is maang ko puraa karne main lage the, hamaari cabinet ne iskaa faisla liya or aaj ye sapana puraa ho rahaa he
 He said that when the Berlin Wall can fall, why can't the hatred between India and Pakistan be overcome
 unhone kaha ki aap bhi guru nanak sahab ke naam par sikaa chalaaen, dharmik sthalon ke liye train chalaaen or kartarpur kaa vikaas karen
 'praise the world for pak's decision', Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said in the program that today is a very important day in the history of India and Pakistan
 unhone kaha ki pakistan kii sarkaar ne jo faisla kiya he vah raajnneeti se prerit nahin he
 This decision of Pakistan is being praised all over the world
 unhone kaha ki ham ye faisla kaaphi samay se lenaa chaahate the, lekin bharat-pakistan ke rishton ke kaaran ye faisla nahin ho sakaa
 PAK has cheated! In this program which is being considered a symbol of peace, Pakistan has once again acted to deceive

 pakistan ke tej gendbaaj shoeb akhtar ne phir se ek vivaad paidaa kar diya he or is baar unhone bharat ke master ballebaaj sachin tendulkar or rahul dravid kii kaabiliyat par sawaal uthaaye hai
 Former Pakistan cricketer Shoaib Akhtar has made strange claims in his biography
 bharat ke mahaan cricketer sachin tendulkar ko shoeb kii gend se lagata tha dar
 It has been claimed that Shoaib's biography, famous for tange bowling, has been controverted
 is kitaab main rawalpindi express ne ye daawa bhi kiya he ki ipel main unke saath cheeting hui
 In Shoaib's biography, Shahrukh Khan and former IPL chairman Lalit Modi have been accused of cheating in the IPL
 pakistan ke vivaadaaspad khilaadi ne apni aatmakatha ‘controvarshili yorse’ main kaha ki tendulkar faisalabad trek par unki teji kaa saamana karne se darate the
 He has also claimed that Tendulkar and Dravid are not match winners nor do they know the art of ending a match win
 akhtar ne apni kitaab main kaha, ‘vivian richards, riki ponting, bryan lara or un jaise kai mahaan ballebaaj hai jinhone balle se dabadabaa banaaya or ve sahi myne main match vijeta the
 Initially, when i bowled to Sachin, i found him lacking these qualities
 unhone bhale hi itane ran or ricard bana liye hon lekin unamem match samaapt karne kii kaabiliyat kii kami he
 The fast bowler announced his retirement during the World Cup this year
 unhone ek udhaaharan bhi diya, jisamen unhen laga ki tendulkar unka saamana karne se dare hue the
 Akhtar said, “sachin was suffering from tennis elbow which benefited us in the series and this greatly affected the performance of this great batsman
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘hamane bounsar se use pareshaan kiya
 When i came to the dressing room on the first day, i came to know that Sachin does not feel comfortable facing fast and bouncy balls
 mere khilaaf vah kaaphi asahaj the or yahi unke khilaaf gendbaaji ke liye kaaphi tha
 'akhtar wrote,' i bowled a fast ball to Sachin which he did not touch, it was a surprise for me
 vah dur hat gaya
 This was the first time i saw him moving away from me and that too on the slow pitch of Faisalabad
 agle match main maine use sir par hit kiya or vah iske baad score nahin bana sakaa
 The 36-year-old Akhtar said that Tendulkar and Dravid are not match-winners who together have added 56,000 international runs (33,000 by Tendulkar and 23,000 above Dravid)
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki sachin tendulkar or rahul dravid shuru se hi match vijeta nahin the or na hi ve cricket main match samaapt karne kii kala jaanate hai
 Akhtar, who played for Shah Rukh Khan's Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL, accused the Bollywood superstar and former IPL Commissioner Lalit Modi of 'cheating'
 unhone kaha, ‘main ipel main mujhe di jaani vaali raashi se khush nahin tha or maine shahrukh se is bare main baat kii
 Shahrukh and Modi convinced me
 mujhe modi or shahrukh kii baat nahin sunani chahie thi
 Akhtar has also talked long about politics in the Pakistan Cricket Board and also accused two former captains Wasim Akram and Shoaib Malik
 unhone malik ko pisibi adhyaksh naseem ashraf kaa chamachaa qaraar kiya or kaha ki tabhi unhen (malik ko) captaini saunpi gayi thi
 Till yesterday, Sara Ali Khan was busy in her father Saif's birthday party

 kaaphi samay se charchaa he kisarcbhishek kapur kii film kedarnath ke saath apana bollywood debyue karne vaali hai
 Looking at this picture, it seems that preparations for his debut are also going on loudly
 is tasviir ko bhi nirdeshak abhishek kapur ne hi instagram par post kiya he

 Earlier, there were also reports that after Sushant's Rabta flopped he was removed from Kedarnath

 Ekta Kapoor is producing this film
 dekhte hai ki sara kii ye film relies hone ke baad unki adaakaari kii kitni charchaa hoti he
 But even before that, he has prepared his very good fan following
 sara kabhi bollywood parties main najar aati hai
 Sometimes, due to their new looks, they become the subject of discussion
 aamir khan apni film sikret superstar ke kaaran charchaa main hai
 This film stars Zaira Wasim in the lead role and Aamir Khan in the supporting role
 aise main sawaal uthanaa lajimi he ki kya aamir khan ko lead actor se kam fees milegi?jab yah sawaal ek patrkaar ne aamir se poocha to unhone ye jawaab diya, 'sambhavat: mujhe jaayra se kam kaa check nahin milegaa
 We have two levels of payment in films
 ek us kaam ke liye jo aap kar rahe hai or jo main kar rahaa hum vah bhi kisi duusare actor ke baraabar he
 Everyone should get equal money
 isi tarah mujhe lagata he ki technicins ko bhi actors ke baraabar paisa milanaa chahie
 Aamir Khan said that it is a fact that your fees in films depends on your contribution in bringing the audience to the theater
 har team main do yaa teen log aise hote hai, jo darshakon ko theatre tak khinch laate hai
 Others cannot do this work
 ise hi staradam kaha jaataa he
 These people could be AR Rahman, salim-javed or someone else
 jis din jaayra darshakon ko khinchne main mujhase zyada kaabil ho jaaegi, us din use beshak zyada fees milegi
 It will not be decided on the basis of gender
 aamir ne bathroom main suni thi 3 idiyat kii script, kholaa khud kii saxes kaa sikretabata den ki femail actor ko mail actor ke baraabar fees die jane kaa maamla pehle bhi uth chukaa he
 The Bollywood actress has given her opinion on something like this
 anoushka sharma- hamaari industry main mail actor kii tulana main apni samakaksh femail actor ko ek chauthai fees milti he
 Think that our expenditure on dress and accessories is 40% of our income
 priyanka chopra-mujhase kaha gaya tha ki femail actors ko riples kiya ja saktaa he, kyonki ve kisi ke bhi peeche jaakar khadi ho sakati hai
 Even today, actresses are paid less fees than mail actors worldwide
 kangana ranot- mere mail counter part ko meri tulana main teen guna zyada fees di jaati he
 Even then, there is no possibility of the film being successful
 aakhir ye asamanta kyon he
 Sonam Kapoor- This is the Practical Society
 yahaan beintahaan langik asamanta he
 i still have difficulties in getting fees, budget for shooting etc
 emnesti international india kii vevesite kii reportsitambar 2015 se june 2019 ke bich desh main 902 aparaadhemnasti international india kii interective website 'halt da het' ke mutabik bharat main 2016 ke baad se kathith 'het krime' kii ghatnaon main teji se badhotaree dekhi gai
 In the first six months of 2019 alone, 181 incidents of such crimes were reported by the website
 beete teen saal kii chhamahiyon kii tulana main ye aankada doguna he
 This represents a dangerous trend in the country
 ye baat emnesti international india ne 2019 kii pehali chamahi ke liye 'het krime' ke aankadon ko jari karte hue kahi
 Targeting in the name of religion? Aakar Patel of Amnesty International India said, 'in India where people are targeted based on their caste, religion and gender identity
 vahaan het krime khatm karne kii patibaddhta ke liye or desh ke dand kanoonon ke liye aavashyak he ki pehle aise aparaadh kiye jane ke peeche rahane vaale purvaagrah ko pahachaanen
 Also, such incidents should be documented
 ye donon hi baaten maujuuda paridrishy se saaf taur par gaayab hai
 Amnesty International India launched the website 'halt the Hate' in September 2015, with no reliable data publicly available on "hate Crime" in India
 upi ke dadri main 52 varshiya mohammad akhlaaq kii bif khaane ke shaq main hatya kiye jane ke baad emnesti international india ne angreji or hindi media main ai reports ko apni website par sankalit kiya
 At the same time, she was classified on the basis of what was the level of violence, against whom she was directed and what was the motive behind such an offense
 kya kehete hai aankadesitambar 2015 se june 2019 tak, 'halt da het' website ne bharat main kul 902 het krime darj kiye
 This year i
e
 in 2019, a total of 181 incidents of alleged hate crime were reported between January and June
 report kii gai 37 ghatnaayen inamen se aisi thim jinamein peedit maare gaye
 More than two-thirds of the victims of the incidents between January and June 2019 were those who suffered due to their Dalit identity
 iske baad muslim (40), adivasee (12), isai (4) or asal yaa dharna ke aadhaar par sexual orientation yaa ling pahchaan (6) kaa number aayaa
 Some alleged hate crimes against Dalits happened because of preventing them from accessing public property like roads, water, crematoriums, schools etc
 17 het krime kii ghatnaayen go raksha or honor kiling ke naam par darj huin
 Who is the highest in the list of victims? Many victims were targeted because of their special identity
 agarmahilaon ko lakshith karkie gaye het krimes kii baat kii jaae unamem peediton kii pahchaan dalit, muslim, isai, adivasee yaa LBT (lesbian, bisexual or transgender) ke taur par saamne ai thi
 In 30 of these incidents, women were either raped or sexually assaulted
 isi tarah, pulavama main farvari 2019 main aatmghaatee bamahamale main suraksha balon ke42 sadasyon kii maut ke baad desh main kashmiri musalamaanon par bheed ke hamale kii 14 ghatnaayen huin
 Most of these victims were small Kashmiri traders living in other parts of the country
 2019 kii pehali chamahi main sabase adhik kathith het krime kii 37 ghatnaayen farvari main huin
 On the second spot, there were 36 such incidents in March, including the most affected, 72 Ht crime in which the crowd was involved
 inamen se aadhi ghatnaayen (37) musalamaanon ke khilaaf nirdeshit thim
 In all such incidents, the victims were either forced to say 'vande Mataram' or 'jai Shri Ram' or 'jai Hanuman' or 'pakistan Murdabad' or were asked to take off their hats
 paanch aisi ghatnaayen raheen jinamein peediton kii maut hui
 Since September 2015, Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states like Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Haryana, Tamil Nadu ruled by AIADMK had the highest incidence of alleged hate crime
 uttar pradesh desh ke sabhi rajyon main het krime kii ghatnaon main sabase upar rahaa
 Between September 2015 and June 2019, there were 216 such crime reports in Uttar Pradesh
 sarvocch nyaayalay ke dishanirdeshon par amal nahinemnasti international india se jude aakaar patel ne kaha, 'durbhaagya se, bharat main het krime kii ghatnaon kii sateek jaankaree uplabdh nahin he
 Because except a few exceptions, the law here does not identify Hate Crime as separate offenses
 nateeja ye he ki aparaadhon ke peeche bhedakaari makasad ko lekar sarkari data uplabdh nahin he
 The alarming increase in the incidence of alleged hate crime clearly shows that there was a lack of implementation of the Supreme Court guidelines
 isse javabdehi kii kami rahi or is tarah ke aparaadhon ko lekar dussahas badha
 However, the Supreme Court in July 2018 insisted on clearly defining 'lynching'
 saath hi rajya sarkaron ko bheed kii ore se kii jane vaali hinsa ko rokane ke liye prabhavi kadam uthaane ke liye kaha
 Only Rajasthan and Manipur are the states that passed the relevant laws
 centre sarkaar kaa jabaabadusri ore centre sarkaar kaa kahana he rajya sarkarein 'mob linching' par kanoon banane main sakasham hai
 In the absence of a clear law, such crimes are recorded in sections relating to 'riot', 'unlawful assembly', 'murder', 'criminal intimidation', 'willful dishonor for breach of peace'
 ye aparaadh kii bhayavahata ko kam karata he
 All this makes the figures not only inadequate but also misleading
 rashtriya aparaadh record beuro (ncrb)aparaadh kii ghatnaon par vaarshik aankadeprakashit karata he
 But since 2016 it has not released a report of 'crime in India'
 aakaar patel ne kaha, 'het krime ko lekar aavashyak he ki aparaadh kii kism or prakruti ke aadhaar par vargeekrut kar data ko sabhi staron par report kiya jaae
 It includes all levels of reporting, investigation, prosecution and punishment
 yah jaruri he ki jaanch adhikari sandigdh het krime kii teji se, nishpaksh dhang se or sabhi pahaluon par jaanch karen
 At the same time, he said, "the prosecution officers should, when sufficient evidence is present, bring the discriminatory motive to the notice of the court
" sabase ahm he ki nafrat or het krime kii saarvajanik taur par ninda ho, or iske liye rajanetaaon kii ore se pahal ho

 sarkaar banane ke dedh saal bitne ke baad bhi yah yojana kai vajahon se hakeekat main nahin utar paa rahi thi
 In the government budget passed in February this year, a provision of Rs 800 crore was made for distributing free saris, but the plan was hanging in the balance due to the absence of an opinion about the color and length of the saris

 An official involved in the meeting says that the biggest problem was the color of the sari
 yah tay hua he ki sari kaa rang aisa katai na ho jisase vah kisi raajnneetik party ke jhande ke rang se mail khaataa ho
 Officials say that the Chief Minister has advised to keep the color of free-selling sarees so that they do not look dirty

 No decision has yet been made regarding the date and inauguration of the plan

 After all, to know how the situation of the country was soon after independence, you should read the letter written by the socialist movement leader Suryanarayan Singh to Mahatma Gandhi
 suryanarayan babu ne mahatma gandhi ko yah patr darbhanga jail se likhaa tha
 Below we are giving this letter as it is
 poojya baapu,sadar pranamadarbhanga jile kii aaj aisi sthiti he, congressi mantrimandal main aaj jo yahaan daman chakra chal rahaa he, jameendaar or sarkari karmchaariyon kaa gathbandhan janata or kaaryakartaaon par jis tarah julm dha rahaa he, aaj isaki ore koi aankh uthaakar dekhne vaala najar nahin aata
 There is darkness all around
 governri shashan main yahaan aaj kii tarah ke daman or julm hote to iske viruddh praant ke rashtriya akhabaaron ke kollam ke kollam mote aksharon se bhar die gaye hote or hamaare netaaon kii bhi aawaaj iske viruddh uthi hoti, jaisaa ki sadaa aaj ke pehle hua karata tha
 But today in the Congress cabinet, where the provincial national newspapers have kept their mouth shut, our Congress leaders also have no time to look and think this, the condition of the District Congress Committees is even worse
 chunaav kii dhaandhlee ke kaaran aaj aise log chotii par hai, jinhen jila ke jan jivan kaa bhayankar akalyaan bhi vichlit nahin karata, aise samay main hamen agar kisi se koi ummid he to vah aap hi ho sakate hai, jisane sadaa satya or nyaay ke liye hi apni jaan baaji par rakhi he
 Since last March, the suppression cycle of the officers of this district started running on the socialist workers, but now we are also becoming the workers of socialists affected by this brutal repression cycle
 gat march main jabaki jile bhar main bheeshan ann sankat prarambh ho gaya tha, jile ke kone-kone main bhukhi janata dane-dane ko taras rahi thi, chor bazaar khub garm tha or jagah-jagah se bhukhmaree kii khabaren aane lagi thim to ham logon ne darbhanga or madhubani main bhukkhadon ke pradarshan kaa aayojan kiya
 By gathering, taking out the procession tried to draw attention of the officials towards the food crisis, but the result was reversed
 marz ke sahi ilaaj ke bajaay sarkaar ne daman niti ko akhriyaar kiya
 After a few days of silence, the district officials started attacking him due to the inspiration of secret advice
 hamaare saathiyon ko bihar 'mentinence of public order act' kaa shikaar banaaya jane laga
 The law, which was used to create havoc with bloodshed to stop the gatherings and rallies of farmer-laborers and whose successful efforts were written by the Collector, was also implicated in this law

 As a result, on April 18, the agrarian peasants of the district, including Hindus, Muslims and women, all participated in seven peaceful demonstrations of great enthusiasm to protest against this unfair arrest

 Such atrocities can be a shame for any government
 sabase uttejnaa dene vaali to yah hui ki auraton par berahami ke saath laathiyaan chalaai gayi, unhen sadakon par ghasita gaya or bhaddi-bhaddi gaaliyaan bhi di gayi
 Torn off national flags and wiped shoes from them, and in this connection 97 persons were arrested and jailed on that day

 The women of the landlords fill themselves with water for their own drinking, this is what makes the community livid, but the women who continue to fill water for their childhood, youth and old age also do not consume anyone
 phir kisaanon or jameendaaron main kuch chetana aa rahi he
 This makes them jealous

 Hundreds of false prosecutions are currently being run across the district to harass farmers and peasant activists
 in dhaandhliyon ke chalate jila bhar ke kisaan jis tarah tabah kiye ja rahe he, unamem se do-chaar kaa namoonay ke taur par ullekh kar dena anupyukt na hoga
 In Jagdishpur, Thana Baheda, Darbhanga, in 1939 AD, the peasants fought for their rights, ate bullets, panchayats and the then District Magistrate wants to intervene the lands of the farmers, dozens of prosecutions were conducted to destroy the farmers

 kisaanon ko pakad kar jail main band kar diya gaya or unki gaiyrhaaziri main hi unke gharon ko lutaa jaataa, bina vajan kiye hi har prakaar kaa galla uthaa liya jaataa
 Taking the landlords along, police officers sneak into people's homes and try to harass them by terrorizing the farmers
 kanoonee karrwai bhi is prakaar kii jaati he ki kanoon ke baahar ke kaam bhi usamen samaa saken
 Such action is being done in the entire district
 jin kisaan kaaryakartaaon ko pakadaa gaya, unhen usee jameendaar babu jiske yahaan shraadh ke uplakshya main bhoj kaa aayojan kiya tha, ke yahaan 24ghante tak bina dana-pani die kaidi kii haisiyat main kothri main band rakhaa or khaanaa maangane par daroga ne unhen laathiyaan deen
 This was done in such a way that the impact of the peasant worker in the common farmers is reduced and the dominance of the landlords comes down on them

 We have been hearing from the childhood that 'cow is our mother', but where it is worshiped in the society due to its usefulness, then on the other hand, there is cow vigor
 desh main isko lekar bahes or vivaad hote rahe hai lekin in sab ke bich ek khabar yah bhi he ki mathura ke muslim samaaj ke logon ne ab gauraksha kaa sankalp liya he
 On the call of the Yamuna Raksha Dal, the people of the Muslim community assured that no Muslim in Brij promotes cow slaughter anyway, and now that the whole society is coming together to protect the cows, the Muslims will not be left behind
 unhone mathura sahit braj main gaukashi par purna pratibandh lagane kaa sankalp liya
 Sant Ramesh Baba of Maan Mandir Seva Sansthan, Barsana, the inspiration for the campaign, addressed hundreds of hindu-muslims at a public meeting convened at Islamia Inter College on Sunday, saying that there was no cow slaughter in India even during the Mughal period
 unhone is sambandh main tatkaaleen badshaah akbar dwaara jari ek farmaan kaa ullekh karte hue kaha ki usne apane rajya main gaukashi par spasht pratibandh laga rakhaa tha, kintu angrejon ne bhartiya arthvyavastha kii ridh (kheti) ko nuksaan pahunchane kii garaj se jagah-jagah gaukashi ke katlgaah khulavaa die
 In this way, the British did a two-way damage to Indian society and worked to break the hindu-muslim brotherhood

 On this occasion, some representatives of the Muslim society expressed concern over the present condition of the cows and said that it is very sad when the cows are seen in the dirt on the streets of mathura-vrindavan in Gopal's city
 hamen kisi bhi prakaar is sthiti ko badalane ke prayaas karne honge
 The conference was attended by Baba Jayakrishna Das, National President of Yamuna Raksha Dal and the leader of Yamuna Mukti Movement, Abdul Jabbar, Convenor of the Conference, Riyazuddin Qureshi, State Secretary of BJP Minority Cell, Ramakant Shastri, President of Mann Mandir, former Provincial Vice President of RLD Dr

 'bancroft ne kaha,‘iske liye main bhi jimmedaar hum kyonki us samay mujhe vahi thik laga
 i paid a heavy price for this mistake
 mere paas vikalp tha or maine baari galati kii
 He said that if he did not follow Warner's suggestion, he felt that he put his interest above the team's interest
 unhone kaha,‘main bistar par jaataa to mujhe lagata ki maine sabhi ko nicha dikhaaya
 i think i lost the team and lost my chance to win the match
 'gauratlab he ki dakshin africa ke khilaaf isi varsh march main hue test match ke dauraan bancroft ko sandpaper (retmal) ke jariye gend kii 'shakl bigaadte hue' camere par pakadaa gaya tha
 The Australian team was criticized worldwide after the ball tampering case surfaced

 To support this 'conspiracy', Cameron Bancroft was banned for nine months

 But there are also many movie stars who have objected to the content of the film
 actress swara bhaskar ne bhi film ke diarector sanjay lila bhansaali kii film padmavat dekhne ke baad twit karte hue da vir main prakashit apane open letters ko post kiya he
 i loved the performances by all the actors in # Padmaavat- The film is seductive in its grandeur, scale, beauty, power of its actors' performances, music, design, vision
 
 
 and therein lies the problem! Some thoughts
 
 sorry abt the length 🙈🙈🙈https: / / t
 co / 0hynvlavad— Swara Bhasker (@reallyswara) January 27, 2018 He started his open letter with the title 'at the End of Your Magnum Opus


 i Felt Reduced to a Vagina - Only'
 swara ne likhaa he ki is film ke jariye bhansaali ji ne sati or johar pratha kaa mahimamandan kiya he
 Swara is very upset with the image of women presented through the film
 open letters kii shuruyaat main to swara bhaskar ne bhansaali kii or se film main kaam karne vaale stars kii tarif kii
 He further wrote that women have been confined as 'vajaina'
 film ke aakhir main rani padmavati dwaara izzat kii raksha ke liye khud ko jala dene ke drishy par vah likhti hai, ‘sar, mahilaon ko rape kaa shikaar hone ke alaava jinda rahane kaa bhi haq he
 You could not sleep the whole night watching "padmavat", whatever you mean by this famous actress - husband, protector, owner, who decides the sexuality of women, women have the right to survive despite their death
 ’ swara aage or bhi talkh rukh apanaate hue kahati hai, ‘mahilaayein chalati-phirti vajaina nahin hai
 Yes women have this organ but they have more
 isliye logon kii puri jindagi vajaina par kendrit, is par niyantran karte hue, isaki hifaazat karte hue, isaki pavitrataa barkaraar rakhte hue nahin bitni chahie
 'I saw Padmavat, the boycott of the Rajputs who committed the violence, also believes that the film is based on historical facts and the evil practices like Sati and Jauhar have been part of our society
 haalanki, vah kahati hai ki film kii shuruyaat main sati-johar pratha ke khilaaf disclemur dikhaa kar ninda kar dene bhar kaa koi matlab nahin he, kyonki iske aage teen ghante tak rajput aan-baan-shaan kaa mahimamandan chalata he
