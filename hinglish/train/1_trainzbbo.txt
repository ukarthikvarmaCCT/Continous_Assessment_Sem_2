 The government will bring the land acquisition bill in the Lok Sabha next Monday
 sarkaar ne is bill ko apni naak kaa sawaal bana liya he or yahi vajah he ki sarkaar ne apni puri takat lagaakar vipaksh ke mansoobon ko naakaam karnaa chaahati he
 Understanding the arithmetic of the Rajya Sabha, the Prime Minister gave the responsibility of accepting four of his senior ministers Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley, Nitin Gadkari, Venkaiah Naidu as small parties

 Saurabh fared well against his experienced rival as Olympic gold medalist Taufiq, 2004
 mukaable ke dauraan vah kai baar badhat banane main kaamyaab rahe lekin use barkaraar nahin rakh sake
 Saurabh started well in the first game to take a 5–1 lead at one time but inexperience hampered him on fragile occasions

 In the meantime, Modi's naming continues with a tight grip on him
 congress netaa shakeel ahamed ne ishaaron hi ishaaron main 'rambo' modi ko 'mogambo' bana daalaa he
 Reacting to Modi, Shakeel Ahmed said, 'I have always been saying that the way some people are trying to become Rambo, they will soon become Mogambo
 'shakeel ahamed ne kaha, 'rambo or mogambo jaise kairactor filmon main hi achche lagate hai
 But the people of BJP are engaged in projecting Rambo to one of their leaders that he comes in the mountains and takes 15,000 people away
 yah bilkul hi haasyaaspad he
 The BJP also retaliated on the Congress attack
 bijepi netaa mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne kaha ki aajkal subah hote hi congressi netaa narendra modi ke bare main bayaan dene lagate hai
 Only time will tell who is Rambo and who is Mogambo? This is not the first such attack on Modi
 isse pehle congress netaa satyavrath chaturvedi ne modi kii tulana ravan se kar daali thi
 He had said if Modi is a super man and does he have the Pushpak aircraft of Ravana? On the other hand, MP Gurdas Kamat described Narendra Modi as a monster and said that he breaks the temple, not builds it

 Finally!! At my sisters place,mastered the art of chopping onions!!! They are still laughing but i have a new skill now Every year Suhaginen fasts for Karwa Chauth (karwa chauth 2018) in wishing her husband a long life
 karvaa chouth ke vrath ko behad kathin mana jaataa he
 Fasting of Karva Chauth is as important as making Chhava
 bina chalni ke karvaa chouth kaa vrath purna nahin ho saktaa he
 On the day of Karva Chauth, the Suhagin women look at their husbands after watching the moon by placing a lamp in the lamp
 apane pati ko chalni se dekhne ke baad hi apana vrath puraa karti hai
 According to religious beliefs, the Moon is considered to be the form of Lord Brahma
 ye bhi manyata he ki chand kii aayu lambii hoti he
 Also, the moon is a symbol of beauty and love
 yahi vajah he ki karvaa chouth ke vrath ke dauraan mahilaayein chalni se chand ko dekhakar apane pati kii lambii umr kii kaamana karti hai
 According to a legend, the moneylender's daughter fasted Karva Chauth for the long life of her husband
 lekin bhukh se uski haalat kharaab hone lagi thi
 The moneylender also had 7 sons
 sahuukaar ke beton ne apni bahan se khaanaa khaane ko kaha
 But the moneylender's daughter refused to eat
 bhaaiyon se jababahanki haalat dekhi nahin gai to unhone chand nikalne se pehle hi ek ped kii aad chalni ke peeche ek jalataa hua deepak rakhkar bahan ko kaha ki chand nikal aayaa he
 His sister then opened his fast by considering Deepak as the moon
 lekin vrath kholane ke baad uske pati kii mutyu ho gai
 It is believed that her husband died due to opening the fast without seeing the real Chandal
 mana jaataa he ki yaheen se swayan apane haath main chalni lekar chand ko dekhne ke baad pati ko dekhakar karvaa chouth kaa vrath kholane kii parampara shuru hui, taaki koi chal kapat se kisi kaa vrath na tudwa sake

 bhartiya cricket team ne 72 saal ke lambey intjaar ko khatm karte hue australian sarajameen par pehali baar test siries jitkar somvaar ko apane cricket itihaas main svarnim adhyay joda
 The fourth and final Test match at the Sydney Cricket Ground missed the draw due to bad weather and rain and thus India managed to win the series 2–1
 iske saath hi usne border- gavaskar trophy bhi apane paas barkaraar rakhi
 India won the trophy in 2017 by winning the series 2–1 at their home grounds
 is siries se pehle or siries ke dauraan australia ke purv captain riki ponting ke saare purvanumaan dhare ke dhare rah gaye or viraat brigade ne kangaaroon ko uski dharti par maat di
 India visited Australia under the leadership of Lala Amarnath for the first time in 1947–48, a few days after independence
 tab uskaa saamana sar don breadman kii ajey australian team se tha
 Since then, Virat Kohli's team finished waiting for India to win the series

 But in contrast, Team India made history by beating Australia 2–1
 ponting kaa sirf ek purvanumaan 'fail' nahin hua, balki atiutsaah main kii gai unki sari bhavishyavaaniyan galat sabit huin
 Ricky Ponting had said shockingly before the series started
 unhone kaha tha ki test siries main donon tiimon main se sabase zyada ran hamaare osman khwaja banaaenge
 He will also be the man of the series
 khwaja ran banane ke maamle main bhartiya captain viraat kohli ko pachhad denge

 vah 198 ran hi bana paae or sarvaadhik ran banane waalon kii suchi main saatven sthaan par rahe
 He could not even beat Kohli, with Kohli scoring more (282) runs than him
 sabase badhkar cheteshwar pujaara ne siries main kul 521 ran banaakar main of da siries ko aword bhi jeet liya
 Virat, who was immersed in the victory celebration, had Ricky Ponting during the embrace of Anushka at the Sydney ground, claiming that India might have to bear the brunt of Cheteshwar Pujara's slow batting in the Melbourne Test
 lekin unka yah anumaan bhi galat sabit hua
 India won the Melbourne Test by 137 runs to take a 2–1 lead in the series
 darasal, pujaara ne us test kii pehali pari main 319 gendon main 106 ran banaae the, jisaki badaulat bharat ne apni pehali pari 443 / 7 ranon par ghoshit kii thi
 The truth is that no Australian batsman could score a century in the series
 uski taraf se marcus haris kii chauthe test match main 79 ranon kii pari ucchtam score rahaa
 It was not easy for his batsmen to play Jasprit Bumrah, Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Shami, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav
 Cheteshwar Pujara is the Player of the Match AND the Player of the Series! # ausvindpic

 Jasprit Bumrah took 21 wickets in the series
 bharat ke paas siries 3-1 se jeetne kaa mauka tha, lekin barish ne uski ummiido par pani pher diya
 India had declared their first innings ended by scoring 622 runs for seven wickets, in response to which Australia were bowled out for 300 runs and had to go on their own soil for the first time in 31 years
 swaraj india ke adhyaksh yogendra yadav ne dilli main behatar shiksha dene ke arvind kejariwal sarkaar ke daawey ko jhooth kaa pulinda qaraar diya
 In fact, Kejriwal government is constantly claiming to provide better education in Delhi, then Yogendra questioned these claims of Kejriwal only on the basis of the figures of Delhi government
 yogendra yadav ne dilli sarkaar ke aankadon kaa hawala dete hue daawa kiya ki kejariwal sarkaar ne in 20 maheenon ke dauraan prachaar par khub paisa bahaya, lekin shiksha vyaystha par pichhali sarkaron se bhi kam kaam kiya
 Yogendra Yadav claims 1
 farvari 2015 ko dilli kii satta main aane ke baad aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ne apana pehla bajet pesh kiya, jisamen shiksha bajet ko dogune se zyaada (106 % vruddhi) karne kii baat kahi gai
 However, the figures that have come out are surprising
 darasal bajet kaa 'yojanabaddh hissaa' (planned component) pichley saal kii tulana main 2,219 karod se 106% badhaakar 4,570 karod kar diya gaya tha, na ki puraa bajet
 Whereas in fact the expenditure is only Rs 2,932 crore
 yani pichley saal kii tulana main (pichley saal kaa shiksha par kharch tha 2,139 karod rupee) shiksha par karch main vaastavik badhotaree 37% kii hui, jis tathy ko aam janata ke saamne galat tareeke se pesh kiya gaya
 2
 aam aadmi party ne 500 nae skool kholane kaa vaada kiya tha
 In the year 2014-15, total 1,007 schools of Delhi Government were in the National Capital Region, which increased to 1,011 by the end of the year 2015-16
 yani saal bhar main kul 4 nae skool khole gaye, jo ki pichhali sarkaron dwaara apane kaarykaal main khole gaye skulon kii sankhya kii tulana main kaafii kam he
 It is also to be noted here that the total number of schools in delhi-ncr has come down from 5,798 to 5,796 in 2015-16
 3
 The people of Delhi were promised 20 new colleges, but statistics show that by the end of the year 2015-16, one college has reduced
 2014-15 main 85 college the, jo 2015-16 main 84 rah gaye
 4
 dilli main 42,827 EWS kota seat hai, lekin usamen se 24,372 EWS kota khaali he
 That is, 57% of the qualified students are not getting the benefit of it
 5
 The Higher Education and Skills Guarantee Scheme was the largest program of the Delhi Government
 is skim ke tahat 30 disambar 2016 tak (yani pichley dedh saal main) kul 405 aavedan aae, jisamen 97 vidhyaarthiyon ko lone diya gaya
 In this, the Delhi government gave only 3 loans, out of which 3
 15 lakh rupee karch hua
 All other loans were given under the similar scheme of the Modi government
 haalanki is yojana ke pehle saal main hi yani 2015-16 main dilli sarkaar ne vigyaapan par 30 lakh rupee kharch kar die
 That means a total of 3 in Delhi
 15 lakh kaa lone dene ke liye aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ne 30 laakh rupee kaa iske prachaar par hi kharch kar diya
 Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav said that the Aam Aadmi Party, which makes big promises and claims on the issue of education, instead of working for the people of Delhi, just keeps on playing the drum of work
 aam aadmi party ke sansthaapak sadsy rahe yogendra ne punjab ko behatar banane ke arvind kejariwal ke vaade par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa or kaha ki punjab ke logon ko bhi dilli aana chahie, taaki hakeekat kaa pataa chal saken

 : / # awkwardmoments # awkwardwhen people wish happy birthday and you accidentally say 'thanks and same to you' # awkwardmomentswhen you call your teacher 'mom' # awkwardmoments Polling date in Rajasthan is very close and before this, there is a gathering of leaders on the platform of Panchayat Aaj Tak in the capital Jaipur, where they are being asked questions related to the public
 isi kadi main kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri or rajasthan ke chunaav prabharee prakaash jaavdekar ne shirkat kii, jisamen unhone chunaav se jude sabhi mahatvapurn pahaluon par jawaab die
 On this occasion, India Today news director Rahul Kanwal, when he questioned the resentment of the party workers and the rebellion after the ticket distribution, accepted the rebellion, but hoped that it would not cause any harm to the party
 itnaa hi nahin, prakaash jaavdekar ne apane jawaab main kaha ki bijepi main congress se kam baghawat he
 He attributed the rebellion to the return of power
 jaavdekar ne kaha, 'jo satta main aata he, usee ke yahaan baghawat hoti he
 Out of this rebellion, hundreds of people have withdrawn their names
 sirf mantri or vidhayak log hai, jo lard rahe hai, unhen hamane nishkasit kar diya he
 Prakash Javadekar hoped that the public would stop the rebel leaders
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki congress ho yaa bijepi janata kisi bagawati ko pasand nahin karegi
 On the question of resentment within the party, Javadekar said that it is not so, some time ago there was a lack of dialogue, but now it is not so and the whole team is united
 unhone bataaya ki party ke 10 lakh kaaryakarta puure rajya main ghar-ghar gaye hai
 Explain that the BJP has expelled ministers, mlas and office bearers from the party's primary membership
 party se tikat katane ke baad baagi hue in netaaon ko namakan waapas lene ke liye manaaya gaya lekin jab nahin maane to 11 netaaon ko party se 6 saal ke liye nishkasit kar diya gaya
 Four ministers of the current government are among the leaders expelled on the rebellion
 alvar kii ramgarh seat se vivaadit bayane dene vaale vidhayak gyandev ahuja kaa tikat bhi kaat diya gaya he, jiske baad unhone nirdaleey chunaav ladane kaa nirnay liya he

 The Congress emerged as the single largest party in Goa's Assembly elections, but despite this, the BJP succeeded in forming the government
 congress kii is naakaami ke peeche party ke sthaneey netaaon khaskar pradesh congress samiti adhyaksh eduardo falero ko jimmedaar mana jaataa he
 According to information received from the sources, the Congress wanted to tie up with Vijay Sardesai's Goa Forward Party before the elections in Goa, but this reconciliation could not be implemented due to Falero's repeated objections
 (padhein-goa main sarkaar banane ke liye gadakari ne kaise kii koshish)iske baadacongresske kendriya netritv ne goa kii fatorda seat par saradesai ke khilaaf apana ummidavaar naa utarkar samjhaute ko aghoshit rup se aage badhaata dikhaa
 However, if sources are to be believed, Goa Congress President Falero also tried to put a hitch in it and announced an independent candidate to be pitted against Sardesai on the Congress symbol
 goa ke prabharee banaae gaye congress mahasachiv digvijay singh phir harakat main aae or unki koshishon ke baad antim kshanon main falero ne apane kadam waapas khinch liye
 After this, the Congress got 17 seats in the 40-member assembly in the assembly elections held on March 11 and the BJP had to be satisfied with 13 seats
 iske alaav jipief or maharashtravaadi gomantak party (emjeepi) ko 4-4 siten tathaa do nirdaleey vidhayakon ko jeet mili
 This result made it clear that Congress would need support from other parties to form the government
 iske baad digvijay singh or purv mukhyamantri digambar kaamat ne saradesai se sampark saadhaa
 After some explanation, two other GPF mlas, including Sardesai, agreed to support the Congress, but placed a condition that Falero should be replaced by another Chief Minister
 iske baad saradesai kii congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi se bhi baat karai gai
 Then late night Digvijay Singh and his team persuaded Falero to make Digambar Kamat the Chief Minister till late night
 haalanki is bich bijepi kii taraf se jod-tod main jute kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ne usee raat saradesai or unki party ke duusare vidhayakon ko saadh liya or agali bhor ko jipief vidhayakon ne manohar parrikar ko siem banaae jane kii shart par bijepi ko samarthan kaa aupchaarik elaan kar diya
 Buzzed by this announcement, Digvijay Singh and Digambar Kamat tried their best to get in touch with GPF mlas including Sardesai, received several calls but their phones kept on shutting down and thus all their efforts were lost
 iske do ghante baad hi manohar parrikar ne goa kii rajyapal mridula sinha se milakar sarkaar banane ke liye jaruri vidhayakon ke samarthan kii chitthee ke saath apana daawa pesh kar diya
 Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said in the Lok Sabha on the second day of the monsoon session that the incidents of lynching had been happening even before
 in ghatnaon par karrwai karne kaa kaam rajya sarkaron kaa he
 The Congress had filed an adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha regarding mob lynching and demanded a discussion on the issue in the House
 iske baad rajnath singh ne is mudde par sarkaar kaa paksh rakhaa
 He said, 'it is true that there have been incidents of lynchings in many places in the country
 jisamen kai logon kii jaane gai hai
 Incidents of lynching have been occurring before
 is dauraan maare vaale logon sankhya kisi bhi sarkaar ke liye chintaa kaa vishay he
 'rajnath Singh further said,' i condemn and criticize the incidents of lynchings on behalf of the government
 ye ghatnaayen afvaahon or andeh ke aadhaar par hoti hai
 But it is the responsibility of the state governments to take strong and effective action against such incidents
 'unhone kaha, 'yah rajya kaa maamla he centre kaa nahin
 Despite this, the central government cannot sit silently on this

 After the defeat, captain Virat Kohli cited Indian batting as the main reason
 kohli ne bharat kii 72 ran se haar ke baad kaha, ‘‘ham lagbhag 70 ran se haar gayi, agar hamane pehali pari main maukey nahin ganvaae hote to ve 220 ran ke aasapaas hi ran bana pate
 Losing many wickets in a short interval made our situation worse
 ham teenon din match main the or yah shandaar match tha
 "captain Kohli believes that any one batsman should have scored 70 to 80 runs in the second innings
" viraat bole ki yah shandaar prayaas tha lekin kisi ko 75 yaa 80 ran banane kii jarurat thi, 20 yaa 30 ran paryaapt nahin the
 He had less of a bowler (dale Steyn) but he pitched the ball in right field and put his life
 hamen bhi apni galatiyon main sudhaar karne kii jarurat he
 "let us tell you that no major partnership was played for India in the first innings apart from the 99-run partnership for the eighth wicket between Hardik Pandya and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, which is a matter of concern for the team
" pandya kii tarif main padhe kasidekohli ne kaha, ‘‘is match main acchhee saajhedaari kii bhoomika ahm hoti or unhone hamase behatar pradarshan kiya
 The bowlers soon took lessons and performed brilliantly in the second innings

 Kohli said, "we have faith in Pandya, whether at home or abroad
 He always wants to do well
" usne gajab kaa jajba dikhaaya or uski pari shandaar thi
 "south African captain Faf Duplessis said his team played well in difficult moments all the time
" unhone kaha, ‘‘is test main har baar mushkil daur main hamane acha pradarshan kiya
 The way we responded each time was a brilliant one
 yahaan tak unki acchhee gendbaaji ke baavjood hamane dabaav nahin banane diya
 "duplessis said," The first morning we expected the ball to take movement but in the first hour we lost a few wickets
 mujhe lag rahaa tha ki 270 acha score he lekin pandya ne iske baad jokhim uthaaya or vah chal gaya
 Again the bowlers handled the responsibility well

 After Qureshi's resignation, Election Officer Chief Justice (retd) VK Bali postponed the nomination review process to be held on Saturday
 bali ne kaha ki samiksha prakiya chunaav ayog ke nae adhyaksh-sadsy kii niyukti ke baad hi shuru hogi
 After this, a very strange situation has arisen, because it will also have an impact on the elections on November 25
 in chunaavon ke tay samay par hone kii sambhaavna kam hi he kyonki puri prakriya main vilamb ho gaya he
 Qureshi resigned, saying, "I appreciate that the IOA appointed an independent committee for the elections
" lekin main apane pad par bana nahin rah saktaa, kyonki ioe ne sarkaar ke khel dishanirdeshon ko sweekaar kiya tha, lekin ab inkaa paalan nahin karnaa chahta
 Qureshi wrote, Since my tenure as Sports Secretary, i have been following the sports guidelines of the government
 ab ioe dishanirdeshon kaa paalan nahin kar rahaa or meraa jameer mujhe pad par bane rahane kii sweekruti nahin detaa
 Staying in the committee would be a conflict of interest

 The IOA had formed a three-member committee to oversee the postponed elections thrice, but after Qureshi's resignation, the apex body of sports in the country would have to find his option
 kuraishi ke istife ke baad nirvachan adhikari mukhya nyaayadhish (sevanivrutt) wike bali ne shanivaar ko hone vaali namakan kii samiksha prakriya ko sthagit kar diya
 Bali said that the review process would start only after the appointment of the new chairman-member of the Election Commission
 iske baad kaaphi ajeeb sthiti paidaa ho gai he, kyonki iskaa asar 25 november ko hone vaale chunaavon par bhi padegaa
 These elections are unlikely to be held on time as the entire process has been delayed
 kuraishi ne istipha dete hue kaha, main isaki saraahna karata hum ki ioe ne chunaavon ke liye swatantra samiti kii niyukti kii
 But i cannot hold on to my post, as the IOA accepted the government's sports guidelines, but no longer wants to follow them
 kuraishi ne likhaa, khel sachiv ke rup main apane kaarykaal ke dauraan se hi main sarkaar ke khel dishanirdeshon kaa paalan kar rahaa hum
 IOA is no longer following the guidelines and my conscience does not approve me to continue in office

 Pakistan has unsuccessfully tried to hide the role of terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed in the attack on CRPF convoy in Pulwama
 pakistan ke videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi ne videshi media ke saath baatcheet main kaha ki pulavama hamale ke liye jaish jimmedaar nahin he
 Shah Mehmood Qureshi said that there is a confusion in what Jaish is said to take responsibility for this attack
 unhone is hamale kii jimmedaari nahin lee he
 Qureshi said, "no, they have not claimed responsibility for this attack, there is a confusion in this, the confusion is that the leadership of Jaish has not said so in this matter
" " shah mahmud kuraishi se jab ek intervyuu ke dauraan poocha gaya ki hamale ke baad jaish ne khud hi kaha tha ki ve iske liye jimmedaar hai
 In response, Qureshi said that he has not taken any responsibility
 isapar virodhabhas kii sthiti he
 During an interview with foreign media, he tried to save Jaish completely
 bataa den ki pulavama hamale main siarpief ke 40 jawan shahid ho gaye the
 Soon after the attack, Jaish released a video claiming responsibility for the attack
 bataa den ki shuukravaar ko shah mahmud kuraishi ne sienen ko die ek intervyuu main mana tha ki jaish kaa sargana moulana masood ajahar pakistan main hi maujuud he
 Qureshi had said that Maulana Masood Azhar is very ill, the condition of his illness is that he cannot leave his house
 unhone kaha tha ki agar bharat moulana masood ajahar ke khilaaf aise saboot detaa he jo pakistan kii adaalat ko maanya ho to pakistan masood ajahar par karrwai karegaa
 Referring to the madrassa in Bahawalpur, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said that India and some countries of the world are giving that madrasa the name of a training camp
 kuraishi ne kaha ki vahaan ek madrasa he, media ko vahaan le jaaya gaya tha or un logon ne jo dekha wo duniya ke saamne hai
 Qureshi once again reiterated the old lie of Pakistan that there is a new government in Pakistan and our new policy is that we will not use our soil for terrorist activities
 chaahe wo bharat hi kyon na ho
 Love is a very special feeling and now even scientists have approved it
 aise main koi lakh koshish kar le phir bhi iske mahatv ko kam nahin kar saktaa he
 No one can say that this happens only in films
 asal jindagi main pyaar jaisaa kuch bhi nahin hota he
 We all have our own thoughts and beliefs about love, but there are many such things that may surprise you
 par ek baat jo tay he wo ye kipyar ek sakaaratmak bhaavana hajo insaan ko bhi sakaaratmak rahane main madad karata he
 There are emotional benefits to love as well as it is also very good for health
 aaie jaanate hai pyaar se judi kuch rochak or mjedaar baaten:1
 Many animals live with the same partner throughout their lives
 wo bhi ek-saathi ke niyam kaa paalan karte hai
 Swans, sparrows, vultures and langurs of many species live with the same mate
 2
 When you look at your partner's eyes continuously for five minutes, during that time your heart also beats in the same synergy
 3
 It takes us only a few minutes to like a person
 kuch minute ke antaraal main hi ham ye tay kar lete hai ki wo shaks acha he yaa nahin
 4
 gale laganaa kisi dawa kii tarah he

 bacchon mencancerbahut aam nahin he
 Due to insufficient data on the basis of population, it is not possible to fully estimate such cases in India
 haalanki, bataaya jaataa he ki 14 saal se kam umr ke bacchon main cancer ke lagbhag 40 se 50 hajaar nae maamle har saal saamne aate hai
 Many of these cases cannot be diagnosed

 Survival of children with cancer has improved in the last 30 years
 aaj kii taarikh main bacchon main cancer ke kareeb 70 pratishat maamle ilaaj ke yogya hai
 Surprisingly, this improvement has not come from the discovery of new drugs to treat cancer in children, but that the improvement has come from the better synergy of three medical methods - chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy
 gauri kapur maanati hai ki uplabdh therapy ko ilaaj ke nae innovations ke saath milaate hue lagaataar kiye gaye clinical trial se yah safalataa hasil kii ja saki he
 These clinical trials have been carried out by various teams working towards the treatment of children in North America and Europe

 paryaapt dekhbhaal ke baad bhi anaavashyak deree, galat pareekshan, adhuri surgery yaa aparyaapt chemotherapy se ilaaj par nakaaratmak asar padataa he
 An average general practitioner or pediatrician is rarely able to identify cancer in a child
 bacchon main cancer ke lakshanon ko dekhakar samajha ja saktaa he ki isaki pahchaan deree se kyon hoti he yaa phir isaki pahchaan kyon nahin ho paati he
 In addition to hematological (blood-related) cancer and brain tumors, other cancers in children do not appear in early adults
 bacchon main sakorma or ambryonal tumor sabase zyada hote hai
 There are many symptoms of cancer in adults which are very difficult to show in children
 bacchon ko hone vaale cancer main apithelial tishyu kii bhoomika nahin hoti he
 Therefore, there is no bleeding outside or epithelial cells do not come out like a crust
 bacchon main cancer ke lakshan-- peelaapan or raktasrav (jaise chakatte, bevajaah chot ke nishaan yaa munh yaa naak se khun)- haddiyon main dard
 - There is no pain in a particular part and the child is often awake at night due to pain

 This was the most dreadful incident of recent times in Delhi
 dilli ke outer ring road par din ke ujaale main police ko insaani jism ke tukade mil rahe the
 After an hour's effort, the police succeeded in successfully retrieving a human corpse in six different pieces from a radius of about three kilometers
 lekin akhir laash kiski thi? is laash ke tukade kisne bikhere? or akhir kyon hua ye qatl?ring rod par mili laash ke 6 tukdebiti 31 march 2017 kii subah qareeb 8 baje the
 On the Ring Road in North Delhi, this day people came to notice something that made everyone's color stand up
 sadak ke bichon-bich kisi insaan kaa kataa hua sir kuch itane karine se rakhaa tha, maanon wo sir naa ho kar koi sho-pis ho
 But even this shock of severed head was not enough
 isi sir se kuch duuri par chaar alag-alag hisson main insaani haath-paanv bhi bikhare pade the
 These pictures were very terrible and were pointing towards some dreadful incident
 kaatil ne aise lagaaya tha laash ko thikanelihaaza foran police maukey par pahunchi or alag-alag hisson main bikhri laash ke in tukdon ko ikattha kar tafteesh kii shuruyaat kii gai
 Police calculated that these pieces were scattered within a radius of about three kilometers
 yani qaatil ne jism ke kate hue hisson ko ek jagah par nahin, balki ring road ke ird-gird gum-gum kar bikher diya tha
 So that neither these pieces ever match nor the secret of this murder story is lost
 yakeenan ye desh kii rajdhani main hue ek aise kaufanaak qatl kii kahani thi, jo is vakt puri tarah blind thi
 Blind means disharmony
 laash ke in tukdon ke sivaay police ke paas is qatl ko lekar philhal or koi jaankaree nahin thi
 Not even a ratty police talash rahi thi suragkate sir or haath-paanv ko dekh kar itnaa to saafe tha ki laash kisi noujvaan kii he, lekin wo noujvaan koun tha
 He lived somewhere nearby or his body was brought here and brought from far away
 ye sab abhi raaj hi tha
 But then the police caught sight of such a thing, seeing that the first hope in the investigation of the case
 laash ke kate hue haath par ek tatu bana tha
 It was written- Om Sai Ram
 ab ye om sai ram hi police ke paas pehla or iklauta suraag tha
 But it was also very difficult for the police to identify the person who died due to this clue
 lihaaza, usne aas-paas ke rihaayshi ilaaqon main aise ladke kii talash shuru kii, jo ghar se gaayab tha
 Tattooed hand made on the first Suragring road, where this corpse was found, it is inhabited by areas like Burari and Sant Nagar in Delhi
 aise main police ne sabase pehle inhen jagahon par gumshuda naujavaanon kii talash shuru kii
 This police work was like finding a needle from a pile of straw
 lekin police peeche nahin hati or jald hi use ek or kamyaabi mili
 He came to know that a young man named Nitin is missing from Sant Nagar
 or ittefaq se uske haath par bhi om sai ram kaa tatu he
 So, is this dead body of Nitin? The identity of the deceased happened that the police had identified the person who died
 lekin uskaa qatl kyon or kisne kiya, ye ab bhi ek sawaal hi tha
 In such a situation, the police started trying to find out where and with whom Nitin, who was last seen dead, was seen
 And in this effort, the police got an important clue
 ye suraag tha ek sisitivi footage kaa
 Indeed, the condition of this corpse scattered in pieces was such that it was not easy to identify
 or yahaan to maamla maa kaa tha
 How would she recognize such a corpse of her son, but Nitin's younger brother did not make a mistake
 usne pahchaan liya ki ye laash uske bhai nitin kii hi he
 The important clue found from the CCTV footage, but the question was that how did twenty-five-year-old Nitin finally reach his house just one evening ago? Who killed him? What could have been the reason for this? And why did the murderer choose such a dangerous way to dispose of the corpse? All these questions were making everyone nervous
 lekin in sawaalon kii tah tak pahunchane ke liye gahari taftish kii darkaar thi
 Now the police started questioning in the surrounding area
 isi koshish main use ek or suraag mila
 Clue of a CCTV footage
 mahaz chand second kii ye sisitivi footage santnagar ke hi ek chemist shop ke paas qaid hui thi
 In which two boys were seen going on bikes
 or in do ladakon main ek nitin tha
 Policemen reached two youths and came to know that Nitin was talking to someone standing outside the same drug shop last evening and after talking, went on a boy's bike and went somewhere
 jinda haalat main yahi nitin kii aakiri tasviir thi
 Now the police, along with Nitin, put all their efforts to find the boy who was last seen
 is ladke kii pahchaan happy ke taur par hui
 However, Happy was missing
 ab police kaa shaq or gaharaa ho gaya
 He started thinking that Happy is the hand behind the murder of Nitin
 is bich technical servilans se police ko ye bhi pataa chalaa ki beeti raat happy ke saath ek or ladke kii telephone par baat ho rahi thi or raat ko donon hi ladakon ke mobile kii lokation bhi saath-saath thi
 This boy was Pawan
 dushmani main kiya berahami se katlpulice ne pawan ke thikaane par dabish di wo naa sirf pakadaa gaya, balki uske makaan main police ko aisi chizein nazar ai, jise dekh kar vardiwaalon ke bhi paanv thithak gaye
 In the room of Pawan, a linen sheet, clothes and other things were lying in the blood
 or to or ghar kaa puraa kaa puraa bed box bhi koon se bharaa tha
 It was clear that Nitin was killed here, the killers had hidden him in this bed box before disposing of the corpse
 lekin sawaal ye tha ki akhir happy or pawan ne nitin kii jaan kyon lee? donon kii usase kya dushmani thi? donon ne 6 qatl kaa itnaa khatarnaak tareeqa kyon chunaa? happy to kair faraar tha
 But the story Pawan told about the plot of the murder was shocking for the police
 ye do saal puraani dushmani kii ek aisi aag thi, jo 15 agast 2015 se hi happy or pawan ke seene main sulag rahi thi
 Due to this, both of them together killed Nitin and divided the corpse into 6 pieces and threw it on the ring road

 aaj tak ke khulaasexsarhua he or railway kaa dalal aa gaya he giraft main
 It is worth mentioning that till date, through the sting operation, the revelation of railway tickets brokerage was extensively disclosed
 railway ke jo dalal hamaare camere kii giraft main aae the unamem se ek rakesh chaurasia ko railway police ne giraftaar kar liya he
 During your under cover operation, your channel was first noticed on March 16 on Rakesh
 vah nai dilli railway stesan ke booking counter par dikhaa tha
 We understood that black has a part in Yedal
 uske haathon main dher sari rigerveshan slip the or usne kai tikaten kharidi thim
 After this, when we showed it again, we stood running with feet on our heads
 balki bhaag kar train ke neeche chup gaya
 Eventually the railway police has arrested it

 The Congress will not campaign much for the upcoming assembly elections in the capital Delhi
 ye jaanate hue ki dilli main apane astitv ko banaae rakhane ke liye in chunaavon main congress karo yaa maro vaali sthiti main he, congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi sirf ek or rahul gandhi 2 raily karenge
 The Congress party leader said that the Gandhi family would go out to campaign only for 10 days
 lekin baaki 6 mukhyamantriyon or baaki varisht netaaon kii agar baat kii jaae to kul 40 netaa milakar dilli main kareeb 150 sabhaayen karenge
 In 2013 too, the high command also campaigned less
 us samay purv chif minister shila dikshit ko dar tha ki zyada dikhaave se upie ke liye satta virdohi lahar uth sakati thi
 It is very important for the Congress to come back to power to maintain its future in Delhi
 haalanki itihaas gavaah rahaa he ki kisi bhi rajya main agar congress neeche girakar tisare sthaan par pahunchi he to badi mushkil se vaapasi kar pai he
 But some people believe that low profile and peaceful campaigning would be better to improve the party's position
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne is baar apana bajet bhaashan hindi aurangreji main rakhaa
 He followed in the footsteps of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and became the special finance minister to do so
 vitt mantri jetali ke paas agle saal hone vaale loksabhaa chunaavon or aath rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle aa rahe is bajet ko loklubhaavan banane kii chunauti bhi he
 Prior to the Finance Minister, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has often preferred to give speeches in Hindi at big events and celebrations
 vah aksar videshi manchon par bhi aisa karte najar aate hai
 Jaitley also presented his budget speech in both Hindi and English languages
 banenge aaazaad bharat ke pehle vitt mantrijetali ne is baar apane bhaashan main hindi or angreji donon bhashaaon main pesh kiya
 All the Finance Ministers have presented budgets in English till date in the history of independent India
 jetali ne puraa bhaashan to hindi main pesh nahin kiya, par iske kuch hisson ko hindi main pesh kiya
 Elections in Hindi-speaking states are special, because this time the budget is being considered important for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections as well as the elections in eight states
 meghalaya, nagaland or tripura, karnataka or mizoram ke alaava hindi bhashi pradeshon rajasthan, madhyapradesh or chhattisgarh main bhi aane vaale samay main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 The last three states are very important for the BJP
 in rajyon ke matadaataaon tak aasaani se apni baat pahunchane ke liye arun jetali hindi main apni baat rakhana pasand kiya
 To give voice to the rural areas, the motive says that the strategy behind Jaitley's speech in Hindi was that common people also take interest in the budget, especially those living in rural areas
 vartmaan modi sarkaar kaa yah antim purna bajet he or iske jariye sarkaar aam chunaav se pehle logon ko lubhaane kii koshish karegi
 Agriculture is a very important part in the budget and this time this sector can get special preference
 saath hi hindi main bajet pesh karke jetali kaa makasad aam aadmi kii isamen ruchi bananaa rahaa, khaskar kisaan samudaay kii bajet ko lekar dilchaspee badhanaa bhi rahaa
 Jaitley, who has been robbed earlier, has been seen speaking in Hindi several times in between his last four budget speeches
 apane pichley lagaataar chaar bajet main vah hindi main kai shaayari bhi pard chuke hai
 He has received applause in Parliament and a lot of discussions outside Parliament on these poets
 is baar bhi unhone aisa hi kiya
 He also counted the achievements of his government in Hindi

 It happens to all of us that we are aware of many things but the rationality of those things is not known
 aisa hi kuch aate ke saath bhi he
 We all know that eating bran flour is beneficial, but very few people know about these benefits
 aksar hamaare gharon main aate ke chokar ko bekaarasmajhakar phenk diya jaataa he
 The flour sold in the market is also very fine
 mana ki aise aate se bani rotiyaan mulaayam hoti hai lekin ye kitni khatarnaak ho sakati hai iskaa andaja bahut kam logon ko hota he
 Talking about wheat, its bran contains many salts and vitamins
 isi vajah se ise adarsh resha bhi kaha jaataa he
 It is more important to use bran flour because the ingredients we get from bran are not available anywhere else
 chokar yukt aataa khaane ke phaayde:1
 Constipation problem is eliminated by using bran flour
 isse aanto main chipka hua mel or gandagi saaf ho jaati he
 Keeping the intestines clean does not produce gas and there is no problem of flatulence
 2
 It works to heal gastric lesions
 3
 Bran should also be used to balance cholesterol
 cholestrol ko niyamit karke ye dil sambandhi bimariyonko bhi hone se roktaa he
 4
 appendicitis or bavasir jaisi bimariyon main bhi chokar vaala aataa bahut phydemand hota he
 5
 ye fibre kaa khajaana hota he jo motopa ghataane main bhi kargar hota he
 And among all this, the power obtained by braking is also used in recharging the battery
 kaha ja rahaa he ki ye hybrid system maujuuda hybrid kaaron se kaafii alag he
 How it performs in the market in the long-distance will be seen
 vahiin car ko zyaada premium, surakshit or aaraamdeh banane ke liye honda ne fichars kii lambii list lagaai he
 ABS, EBD, vehicle stability assist with traction control, brake assist, hill start assist and six airbags
 vahiin, kai angel se dekhne ke liye camere bhi
 The engine also has a remote start so that it can cool down before entering the car
 car main media or internet ke istemaal ke liye appal car play or android auto bhi diya gaya he
 There is a three-year unlimited km warranty and a five-year warranty on the hybrid battery
 tippaniyan May be you wonder why the new price is coming in double price from the price range that was in the previous record? So the reason is that it is being brought from the CBU route
 to qeemat ke hisaab se bmdablyoo ke 3 series, audi kii e-4 yaa marcedes kii si-class ke takkar main aa gai he
 But the car has also been made premium in terms of features and comfort
 ho saktaa he ki is segment kii kaaron ko chhodkar graahak acord hybrid kii taraf bhi aaen
 At the same time, the car it is currently competing with, ie the Camry Hybrid of Toyota, is also worth around three lakhs less than the Accord
 kair
 
 
 Even though there is not much market for hybrid cars in India, it is also true that customers may not think of the environment as they think in developed countries, but they will like its affordable and luxury package
 aise main yahi lag rahaa he ki company ke paas package to zordaar he par ise bharat main banane yaa assembl karke isaki qeemat ko neeche laayaa ja sake, to ho saktaa he khud ko bhi chakit kar den
 At the same time, Honda has made a long list of features to make the car more premium, safe and comfortable
 ABS, EBD, whical stability acist trection control ke saath, brake acist, hill start acist or chah airbag
 At the same time, cameras for viewing from many angles
 ingine remote start kii bhi suvidha he, taaki car main ghusane se pehle hi use thanda kar saken
 Apple Car Play and Android Auto have also been given for media and internet use in the car
 teen saal kii analimited kimi kii varantee he or paanch saal kii varantee hybrid betry par he
 The comments ho saktaa he aap sochen ki pichhali acord jis qeemat range main thi, nai usase dabl qeemat main kyon aa rahi he? to uski vajah he ki ise sibiyu ke root se laayaa ja rahaa he
 In terms of price, the 3 Series of BMW, Audi's A-4 or Mercedes c-class has come in competition
 par car fichars or aaraam ke hisaab se premium bhi banaai gai he
 Except for cars in this segment, customers may also come towards the Accord Hybrid
 vahiin iskaa muqaabala jis car se filhal ho rahaa he yani toyota ki camri hybrid, uski qeemat bhi acord se teen lakh ke aasapaas kam he
 Well 
 
 bhale hi bharat main hybrid kaaron kii zyaada market nahin he, par ye bhi sach he ki graahak bhale hi paryaavaran ke bare main vaise naa sochen, jaise viksit deshon main sochate hai, lekin wo isaki kifaayat or lagzri vaale package ko pasand karenge
 In such a situation, it seems that the company has a strong package, but if it can be made or assembled in India to bring its price down, then it may surprise itself

 Shah Rukh's new film My Name Is Khan got a bumper opening and King Khan got a bit soft
 pehle maafee na maangane par ade shahrukh ne germany main kaha ki wo is maamle par baatcheet karenge
 The trend is also soft
 mumbai se lekar karachi tak or neuyork se lekar berlin tak khan kaa tufaan jo chalaa
 Khan's madness removed the borders of the borders
 saat samandar paar buland aawaaj main gunja khan kaa afasana
 What Karachi, Berlin and New York saw King Khan's craze everywhere
 neuyork nisaar ho gaya is khan ke jalwe par
 Shahrukh showed why he is the king of the overseas market
 film kii banpar opening se khan ho gaye hai khush
 The softness in Shahrukh's stance on not apologizing first is now clearly visible
 shahrukh ko maaloom he ki duniya ke chakkar lagane ke baad bhi unki manzil mumbai hi he
 So he made a gesture to bow down
 bhale hi shivasena kaa virodh kaamyaab na rahaa ho
 But King Khan knows that staying in Mumbai and hating the Shiv Sena is not a good deal for him
 
 
 to kuch aisa kar den ki sena bhi khush rahe or khan bhi

 chambal ke daakuon kii kahani hameshaa hindi cinema ke darshakon ko aakarshith karti rahi he
 There are many block buster masala films on the story of dacoits from Sholay to Paan Singh Tomar
 yahaan tak ki phulan devi ke jivan par baniin oibeet bandit queen ne bhi tikat khidki par shandaar kamai darj kii
 But Sonchidia, which was released last Friday, was disappointed in terms of earnings
 multistarar sonchidiya ko lekar vaisaa utsaah dekhne ko nahin mila jaisaa ki chambal or behad kii kahani par bani filmon ke liye dikhataa rahaa he
 Sonchidiya stars well-known actors like Sushant Singh Rajput, Bhumi Pednekar, Manoj Bajpayee, Ranveer Shorey, Ashutosh Rana
 film kaa nirdesan abhishek choube ne kiya he
 But the film made in the budget of 30 crores, only 4 in the first weekend
 60 karod rupee hi kama pai
 Sonchidiya's pace has been slow since the beginning
 aise main film kaa bajet nikaal paanaa naammumkin dikh rahaa he
 Sonchidiya was rated well by the critics
 baaki bi-toun stars ne bhi movie ko acha rispons diya tha
 Now the question is that despite the strong content, the crowd of stars and the good acting, how did the film miss the crowd of the audience in theaters? Maybe it is due to these three reasons that Chambal's charm did not show in theaters this time
 
 
 Hahaha :)) 😉🙏❤️🍻💥 Sonchiriya 1st March 2019 💥 @bhumipednekar @bajpayee

 Releasing on low screens The biggest reason for the low collection of Honolmty Starrer movie is its release on low screens
 ise kul 940 screens par relies kiya gaya
 Sonchiriya received 720 screens in India and 220 screens in overseas
 jabaki sushant singh kii film ke saath relies hui luka chuphi ko bharat main 2100 or oversij main 407 screens mili
 Sonchiriya has suffered the loss of low screen sharing
 kaha ye bhi ja rahaa he ki film ko rural ilaakon main kam screens mili
 Where its target audience was
 luka chuphi ke alaava ek hafte pehle relies kamedi drama total dhamal kaa bhi screen par kabja tha
 Kar rahe hai yeh robbing the garden plot, thoda wait, yeh robbery shuru hogi from 1st March

 agressive pramotion naa honasonchidiya kaa agressive tareeke se pramotion nahin hua
 However, in TV reality shows, the film's lead actors did make an appearance
 lekin unic subject par bani movie kaa pramotion or behatar tareeke se ho saktaa tha
 It would not be wrong to say that Sonchidia has failed to reach its audience
 baagiyon ke beehad mein hamesha shaanti rehti he, sab bade pyaar se joh rehte hai! Miliye inse 1st March se aapke nazdeki cinemagharon main! @sushantsinghrajput @bhumipednekar @bajpayee

 ' a complaint has been lodged against Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan for singing the national anthem more than the scheduled time
 unhone shanivaar ko kolkata ke eden gardens main bharat or pakistan ke bich hue world tii20 match se pehle raashtragan gaaya tha
 It is alleged that Big b finished the national anthem in 1 minute 10 seconds instead of 52 seconds

 unhone 'daayak' kii bajaae 'nayak' shabd kaa istemaal kiya
 Amitabh often sings the National Anthem during the Games competition

 1
 aazaadee aadhi raat ko:14 agast kii raat 11 baje se hi aazaadee samaaroh shuru ho gaya tha
 One of the main speakers of the ceremony was our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru
 nehru ne kaha, 'madhya raatri kii is bela main jab puri duniya neend kii agosh main so rahi he, hindustan ek nai jindagi or aazaadee ke vaataavaran main apni aankh khol rahaa he
 It is a moment that is rarely seen in history, when we enter from the old era to the new era and when an era comes to an end and when the soul that has been suppressed for many days of a country suddenly finds its expression
 ' nehru ne yah bhaashan english main diya tha lekin iske baavjood bhi bahut se english na jaanane waalon kii ankhen nam ho gayi thim
 2
 nahin jhuke hamaara tirangaa:tirange ko lekar nehru ne disambar 1929 lahore adhiveshan main yaadgaar bhaashan diya
 Nehru said in his message, 'once again you have to remember that now this flag has been hoisted
 jab tak ek bhi hindustani mard, aurat, baccha jinda he, yah tirangaa jhukna nahin chahie
 '3
 bantwaare kii shikaar mahila:bantwaare kii takalif sabase zyada mahilaon ko hi uthaani padi
 Countless cases of rape, kidnapping of Hindus, Muslims and Sikh women were reported
 baad main sarkaar kii koshishon se jab yah mahilaayein waapas ghar lautne kii sthiti main ain to bahut sari mahilaayein yaa to ghar janaa hi nahin chaahati thi yaa mahilaon ke pariwaron ne 'apavitra' kah unka parityag kar diya tha
 After independence, the number of women in the brothels of Delhi, Mumbai had increased considerably
 nehru ne ek radio kaarykram ke jariye in mahilaon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'bantwaare ke dauraan jin mahilaon ko tamaam tarah kii takalifon kaa saamana karnaa padaa, unhen ye nahin sochna chahie ki hamen unke charitra ke bare main koi andeh he
 We want to bring them back with love because it is not their fault

 Nehru's Opinion on Jannat: Kashmir's peace was disturbed in October 1947 by a tribal attack by attackers from Pakistan
 us vakt kashmir bharat main shaamil nahin hua tha
 India had prevented the tribal attack from escalating by sending troops in time
 kashmir main shanti sthapit ho jane ke baad nehru ne apni bahan ko khat likhakar kaha, 'main yah maanata hum ki kashmir ke bhagya kaa faisla kashmiri log hi karenge
 As far as i am concerned, i have no objection that Kashmir should become almost free
 lekin yah ek krur majaak hoga ki kashmir pakistan kaa ek shoshit hissaa banakar rah jaae

 Let them go from here
 is baat par sadan main hangaamaa shuru ho gaya
 Seeing the uproar, Nehru went to the stage and told the members, 'this is not a Jhansi public meeting that you get up and start giving your knowledge in a loud voice saying brothers and sisters
 '6
 Nehru's attitude towards minorities: From the formation of the nation to the partition of the country, the consideration of minorities posed a major challenge for Nehru
 nehru ne is bare main ek baar kaha, 'ham jis tarah se apane bahusankhyak samaaj ke saath vyavhaar karte hai, usee tarah kaa vyavhaar alpsankhyak varg ke saath bhi karenge
 i would say that minorities should not only be treated equally, but should be treated in such a way that they realize that there is no discrimination against them

 Nehru's 95-minute speech: In 1952 the first election was held in India

 Will stay '8
 Stubborn Nehru: Nehru was very stubborn in some respects
 andhra pradesh kii maang ko lekar 19 oktober 1952 ko potti shriramlu ne aamaran anshan shuru kar diya tha
 This fast received a lot of support from the people
 is bare main nehru ko bhi yathasthiti pataa thi
 On December 3, Nehru wrote a letter to Madras Chief Minister Rajagopalachari, saying, "events like the fast for the demand of Andhra Pradesh have started and i am getting telegrams which are discordant in this regard
" main isse bilkul bhi prabhavit nahin hum or main ise puri tarah se nazarandaaj kar dena chahta hum
 'but 12 days after this letter, on 15 December, Sriramalu died on the 58th day of fast
 maut kii khabar sunate hi andhra kaa puraa ilaaka hinsa main dub gaya
 In view of the violence, two days after the death of Sriramalu, Nehru agreed to the formation of the state of Andhra Pradesh

 Nehru's biggest problem: After independence, many leaders and citizens faced a lot of difficulty in building India
 nehru se ek baar francisi lekhak melroux ne aazaadee ke baad unki sabase badi samasya ke bare main jaananaa chaha
 Then Nehru said, 'the biggest problem for me was the creation of an egalitarian society through fair means
 shaayad ek dharmik desh main dharmanirpeksh rajya kaa nirmaan bhi mere liye samasya rahi he
 '10
 jab nehru ne maani haar:26 november 1962, wo din jab pradhanmantri nehru ne radio ke jariye chini phujon ke aage bharat kii haar kaa elaan kiya
 Nehru said, 'these Chinese forces attacked us and these people from the eastern border province of Nefah entered our country and they attacked our military troops
 uske baad vahaan ek kaaphi badi jang hui
 The Chinese put such a large army there that they removed and suppressed the small army from us

 Significantly, in April, the Saudi Arab Emirates had expelled Omar and two other beautiful youngsters who had joined during a festival, not only from the program but also from the country

 The members of the commission feared that the women attending the ceremony might make connections with them

 bharat chodo andolan ke 75 saal puure hone ke maukey par buudhvaar ko loksabhaa main pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi or phir congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne apana bhaashan diya
 On this historic occasion, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress President Sonia Gandhi remembered the brave soldiers of independence and called for inspiration from their struggle
 lekin ye mauka modi or sonia ke bich kii raajnneetik pratidwandvita se nahin batch sakaa
 The two leaders fiercely targeted each other's ideology
 ye pehla mauka tha jab sansad main modi or sonia is tarah aamane-saamne the or donon ne ise bhunaane kii koi kasar nahin chodi
 Sonia said that this movement reminds us that people with narrow mindset cannot be allowed to be prisoners of divisive thinking
 mahatma gandhi ne ek nyaay sangat bharat ke liye ladaai ladi thi
 But this has been clouded by the politics of hatred and division, the scope of the debate of ideas in the public space is getting reduced, at times, the rule of law also seems to be strengthening the illegal powers
 agar hamen apni aazaadee ko surakshit rakhana he to hamen har damankaaree shakti ke khilaaf sangharsh karnaa hoga chaahe ve kitni bhi sakasham ho
 We have to fight for the India in which we believe, in which everyone in India is free, whose freedom is unquestioned
 sonia ke loksabhaa main die gaye bayaan par 'aaj tak' ne desh ke kuch netaaon kii pratikriya lene kii koshish kii
 In which BJP leaders condemned Sonia's statement, former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and senior leader Farooq Abdullah appeared in his favor
 farrukh abdulla ne kaha, "bharat kii haalat aaj bahut kharaab he
 Today people are being divided and oppressed in the name of religion
 iske liye andolan hona chahie
 We are together, many people have sacrificed for the independence of the country
 aresas ne bharat chodo andolan kaa virodh kiya tha, ye sach he
 BJP does politics on every subject and accuses others
 bijepi netaa kailash vijayawargeey ne kaha, "sonia gandhiji kaa bhaashan jisane likhaa he unhone vishay kii gambhirtha ko samajha nahin he
 Today, remembering to participate in Quit India Movement, we had to discuss and not to do politics
 aaj ke din sonia gandhi ko raajnneeti nahin kerani chahie
 Sonia Gandhi is not fully aware of history, so she has given this statement
 unke script riter ne thik se research nahin kiya tha
 "BJP leader Giriraj Singh said," i feel pity for those who have done politics to this day
 pradhanmantri ji sankalp le rahe hai ki desh se garibi, berogari ko dur karnaa he lekin kuch log aaj bharat chodo andolan main bhaag lene vaale logon ko yaad karne kii jagah raajnneeti kar rahe hai, desh unhen maaf nahin karegaa
 It is not so easy to understand the Sangh
 uske lierashtravadako samajhnaa hoga
 For that one has to understand the history of the Sangh
 aaj sonia gandhi ne jo raajnneeti kii he desh unhen maaf nahin karegaa

 The debt waiver promise returned the Congress to power in three states
 somvaar ko madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantriyon ne shapath lene ke chand ghante ke andar hi karjamaafee kaa elaan kar diya
 For Congress President Rahul Gandhi, who is looking for political land with the help of farmers, the debt waiver is like Sanjeevani
 aise main ab congress is mudde ke sahare 2019 kii siyaasi bisaat bicha rahi he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi had drawn such a streak in the politics of the country with the slogan of Congress-mukt Bharat, in which BJP was seen from the center to the states of the country
 aise kathin daur main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi desh kii siyasat main apni jagah banane ke liye kisaanon ke karjamaafee mudde ko lekar aage bade
 Within hours of taking oath of Chief Minister, Kamal Nath signed the loan waiver file
 is aadesh ke saath hi kisaanon ko sarkari or sahakaari baikon dwaara diya gaya 2 lakh rupye tak kaa alpakaaleen fasal rin maaf ho jayega
 After MP, the debt of farmers in Chhattisgarh was also waived
 bhupesh baghel ne mukhyamantri pad kii shapath grahan karne ke baad cabinet kii baithak kii or kamalnath kii raah par chalate hue kisaanon kaa karj maaf karne kaa elaan kiya
 The loan of 6100 crore rupees of the farmers of the state will be waived
 in teen rajyon se pehle congress ne punjab or karnataka main bhi kisaanon ke karjamaafee ke vaade par amal kar chuki he
 Whereas in Karnataka the Congress is running the government in collaboration with JDS
 baavjood iske congress ne kisaanon kii karjamaafee ke vaade ko puraa kiya tha
 The debt waiver of the Congress has created problems for the BJP
 aise main modi sarkaar ab karjamaafee kaa kadam uthaati bhi to congress iskaa shrey lene se nahin chukegi
 Explain that during the Congress-led UPA-1 government, the debt of farmers was waived
 rahul isi aadhaar par samay-samay par modi sarkaar se samuhik kisaanon kii karjamaafee kii baat uthaate rahete hai
 He keeps saying that when the government can waive the debts of the industrialists, why not the debt of the farmers? With the debt waiver of the farmers, the Congress has tasted victory in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections once again with the same issue to win the political war of 2019
 Has gathered congress ne teen rajyon main vaapasi ke baad madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main karjamaafee karke trump card chalaa he
 Rahul Gandhi has been struggling for a long time on the issue of farmers since recent election campaigns
 uttar pradesh main mayawati sarkaar ke dauraan bhatta parsul kaa mudda uthaa tha
 Where the farmers' agitation was going on against the land acquisition
 vahaan rahul gandhi motorcycle par savaar hokar pahunche the
 While the police had blockade around Bhatta Parsaul village
 iske baad bhi rahul kisaanon ke bich pahunchane main kaamyaab ho gaye the
 He consistently raised the demand of farmers in his election rallies
 rahul gandhi ne kisaanon kii ladaai ko puri takat ke saath ladane ke liye kai rajyon kaa daura kiya tha
 He did hikes across the country from north to south in the scorching sun
 rahul ne punjab se paidal yatra shuru kii or phir maharashtra ke vidarbha or telugana main, kerala main machuaaron kii samasya ko lekar padayatra kii thi
 Rahul went to the homes of farmers suffering from unseasonal rains, heavy rains and hailstorms, who committed suicide due to some reason after the natural calamity
 jantar-mantar par baithe tamilnadu ke kisaanon ke bich bhi rahul gandhi pahunche the
 When the Modi government was going to amend the land acquisition bill, Rahul came on the road
 rahul uttar pradesh ke aligarh jile ke tappal gaanv main bhi gaye the, jahaan kisaan jameen adhigrahan ke khilaaf andolan kar rahe the
 After this, the Modi government had to pull back
 rahul ne upi vidhansabha chunaav se pehle 2500 kimi kii kisaan yatra kii thi
 He used to do Khat Sabha among farmers
 desh bhar ke kisaanon par ek report bhi rahul ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko saunpi thi or kaha tha ki kisaanon ke karj maaf karen
 After winning elections in three states, Congress governments immediately followed Rahul's promise and the Congress governments of Madhya pradesh-chhattisgarh decided on debt waiver within a few hours of their swearing in

 But neither Akhilesh nor Mayawati are on her target
 rahul ke nishane par hai to sirf piem modi
 On the pretext of farmers, Rahul Gandhi is making sharp attacks on PM Modi
 rahul gandhi logon se piem ke videsh dauron, piem kii selfi or 10-12 udyogpatiyon se piem modi kii nikatataa or unke karj maafee kii charchaa apane har bade-chote bhaashan main kar rahe hai

 However, this visit of Rahul Gandhi is focused on farmers and their issues, Rahul Gandhi wants to make a loan waiver of farmers a campaign so that it does not benefit in UP, it will emerge as a big promise in 2019 elections

 This time with his unmatched performance, India reached the distance of two matches after becoming the world champion after 27 years, while Ricky Ponting's dream of completing a hat-trick of titles as captain was shattered

 Despite Sachin Tendulkar's 53 and Gautam Gambhir's 50, when the Indian score was 187 for five, the two teams seemed to have an equalizer on the match

 He scored an unbeaten 57 off 65 balls with eight fours and a 74-run unbroken partnership with Suresh Raina (34 not out) to help 1983 champions India 47

 Yuvraj, running in excellent form, opened his account by hitting a four in the same over
 unhone apane pedal sweep kaa acha namoona pesh kiya lekin duusare chor par gambhir ardhashatak puraa karne ke baad apni galati se ran out ho gayi
 Yuvraj then stood in his place playing ball on Thirdman while Gambhir ran to the half pitch and thus his innings was limited to 64 balls which included two fours
 yuvaraj ne tait kii gend hawa main laharaakar chaar ran ke liye bheji or phir brett lee par third main or cover main chaukaa jadkar unka aatmavishvaas diga diya

 He gave 18 runs in six overs of the first spell but 32 runs were taken in the last four overs
 lekin ponting puri patibaddhta ke saath krij par utre the
 Ponting, who was the target of media due to poor form, then played an innings by playing the role of anchor while wickets were falling from the other end

 yuvaraj ne 44 ran dekar do wicket liye
 Zaheer, however, did not allow the new batsman Cameron White (12) to stay any longer and gave the bowler an easy catch

 "he adds that but every time the energy is new in the farmers

 He laughs and says, "see who is tired first?" However, these farmers from Tamil Nadu have warned that if they are not allowed to go to Parliament on Friday, they will protest naked

 But just like every other time, the same question is, will the ruling rulers sit in Delhi protest? *** ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan ko lekar ek taraf jahaan sadhu-santon ke sabar kaa baandh tut rahaa he or unhone modi sarkaar ko turant is masale par adhyadesh laane tak kaa ultimatum de diya he, vahiin bhartiya janata party ke bheetar ram mandir par abhi tak koi charchaa hi nahin hui he
 On Sunday, on the occasion of the conclusion of the religious program in Delhi, sadhus and saints from all over the country passed the proposal for the construction of the Ram temple, which said that now there will be no agreement nor any talks on the construction of the Ram temple
 For this, instead, the government should bring an ordinance or enact laws at the earliest
 santon ke is nirnay ke baad sattadhari bijepi ke rashtriya pravaktaa shahanvaj hossain ne ajtak se kaha ki ram mandir kaa maamla pichley aath saal se supreme court main he, isliye desh kii janata chaahati he is masale par kanoon banaaya jaae
 'no discussion on Ram temple in the party' When Shahnawaz Hussain was questioned on the decision of the saints, he called the demand for the construction of Ram temple a right of saints
 saath hi santon kii kanoon banane kii maang par unhone kaha ki tathyon ko dekhne ke baad sarkaar ko faisla karnaa he ki kanoon bananaa he yaa nahin
 However, being the spokesperson of the Bharatiya Janata Party, he said that i am the authorized spokesman of the party and there has been no discussion in the party about the construction of the Ram temple
 shahanvaj hossain ne ye bhi kaha ki ram mandir cese desh kaa sabase purana maamla he or sirf aresas yaa viechpi hi nahin, balki desh kii bahut badi aabaadi chaahati he ki is masale par jald faisla aae
 What was decided in the gathering of saints: The two-day program of the program came to an end on Sunday, in which Swami Jitendra Nand Saraswati, the National General Secretary of the All India Saints Committee, said on the construction of Ram temple that it is not a request but an order
 unhone kaha ki kanoon laayaa jaae or chunaav se pehle ram mandir ke nirmaan kaa kaam puraa ho
 If it is not done then we know our way
 santon ne kaha ki itihaas main pehle bhi bahut kuch ho chukaa he, ab mandir nirmaan hokar rahegaa
 Let us tell you that this statement of Shahnawaz Hussain has come in such an atmosphere when many big leaders associated with BJP, even a minister in Modi government, are strongly demanding the construction of Ram temple immediately and the question is also postponed in Supreme Court

 After the start of the new season with a win, Team India will look to maintain the winning momentum in the second ODI against Sri Lanka on Tuesday
 bharat ne viraat kohli kii 106 or senior ballebaaj virendra sahvaag kii 96 ran kii pari kii badaulat pehle vanade main srilanka par 21 ran kii jeet darj kii thi
 The first ODI pitch at the Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium was the preferred pitch for limited-overs matches, where the batsmen had a chance to play a good innings after getting settled
 yah wicket tas jitkar ballebaaji karne ke anukool thi or bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne bhi aisa hi kiya
 Initially strong winds helped the bowlers to swing the ball but overall the conditions were favorable to the batsmen
 bharat ke liye ek or acchhee khabar ho sakati he
 Fast bowler Nuwan Kulasekara, who has consistently performed well for Sri Lanka in recent times, has been ruled out of the series due to groin injury
 pehle vanade main kaich lapakane kaa prayaas karne ke dauraan unhen yah chot lagi thi
 In tomorrow's match, once again everyone's eyes will be on Virat Kohli, who is in excellent form and has scored four centuries in his last five matches
 satr ke pehle hi match main shatak banane se kohli kaa aatmavishvaas bhi badha hoga
 It is the same with Sehwag
 chot ke kaaran asia cap se baahar rahane vaale sahvaag ne team india ke aagaamee vyast satr kii shandaar shuruuaat kii he
 Gautam Gambhir, who returned to the pavilion cheaply in the first match, will play tomorrow with the intention of forgetting this disappointment
 suresh raina or captain dhoni simit overon ke maichon main lagaataar acha pradarshan karne main safal rahe hai or antim overon main inkaa bahumoolya yogadan nishchit taur par kaaphi antar paidaa karata he
 Rohit Sharma's fluctuating form may however be a matter of concern for the Indian team
 yah ballebaaj apane 81 vanade maichon ke karier main apni pratibha ke mutabik nahin khel paaya he or ab usne sirf do shatak jade hai
 Rohit will also be disappointed with his average above 32 and he will have to focus on consistently doing well in the upcoming matches
 haalanki is baat kii sambhaavna nahin lagati ki bharat agle kuch maichon main apni antim ekadash ko koi badlaav karegaa, basharte koi khilaadi chotil nahin ho
 Captain Dhoni, who was punished for his slow over pace in the last match, will however be expecting a better performance from his bowlers
 alrounder irfan pathan kii maujuudagi ne team ko jaruri santulan pradaan kiya he
 His pace of the ball has decreased significantly but his ability to get movement from the new ball makes him a strong choice, especially given the presence of an aggressive batsman like Dillakaratne Dilshan in Sri Lanka's top order
 bharat ko iske alaava behtareen farm main chal rahe kumaar sangakaara kaa bhi tod nikaalnaa hoga jinhone pichley match main 133 ran kii pari kheli thi
 Dilshan and Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene do not go through poor form for long and are capable of taking any bowling attack on their day
 bharat ke senior tej gendbaaj jahir khan or yuva umesh yadav ne pehle match main adhik ran kharch kiye the or inhen kifayati gendbaaji karne par dhyaan dena hoga
 In the last match for India, off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin was the best bowler and he kept the Sri Lankan batsmen tight in the middle overs
 vaapasi kar rahe pragyan ojha ke khilaaf sangakaara ne khulkar ran batore the lekin jayavardhane ke wicket se nishchit taur par unka manobal badha hoga
