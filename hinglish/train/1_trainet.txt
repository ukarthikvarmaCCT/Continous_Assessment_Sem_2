 yah kahani sirf uttar pradesh kii nahin he, har pradesh main aisi kahani hogi jahaan karmchaaree kai saal tak sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon main kaam karne ke baad baahar phenk die jate hai
 After 10 years, 20 years of government jobs, these people, who were thrown out, are seen staging a sit-in outside the secretariats and the district office
 aisa nahin he ki ye adaalaton se nahin jitate, jeetne ke baad bhi inaki niyukti nahin hoti he or agar haar gaye to court ke faisle kaa bahaanaa banaakar hameshaa ke liye inaki sunwaayee band kar di jaati he
 There is a need for strict review of the government's policy and the decision of the court so that a measure can be made that it cannot be carried so easily by taking ten to twenty years of service and pretending to rules and norms
 ham aaj uttar pradesh ke shiksha mitron kii baat karne ja rahe hai
 It is not that the media did not talk about them; local newspapers are full of agitations and demonstrations by Shikshamitras
 news channelon ne bhi dikhaaya magar inaki samasya kaa samaadhaan kaa kuch ata pataa nahin he
 Whereas this matter is not one hundred two hundred and not one lakh 70,000 education friends
 sankhya ke lihaaz se bhi sochie ki yah kitna bada maamla he, magar iskaa samaadhaan kya hoga kisi ko pataa nahin
 Shiksha Mitras have been sitting on a dharna in Lucknow for 49 days
 pichley ek saal main kitna dharna de chuke hai, hisaab karnaa mushkil he
 His story is such that from 2002 to 2009, one lakh 78 thousand Shiksha Mitras are appointed
 pehali or duusari kaksha ke bacchon ko padhaane ke liye
 There were no trained teachers at that time, so they were appointed instead, because the literacy rate in the country was very low
 in shiksha mitron kii selary 2002 main 1850 rupye thi jo 2014 main regular hone se pehle 3500 par pahunchi thi
 He taught 12 years in schools for so little money
 11 july 2011 ko upi sarkaar kaa aadesh nikalataa he ki in sabhi ko sarkari santhaan se duurastha shiksha ke zarie beatisi kaa course karaayaa jayega
 When he was appointed, there were many inter passes
 magar zyaadaatar ne bie kii degree hasil kar lee or beatisi kaa bhi certificate mil chukaa tha
 From 1 August 2014, they get around 40,000 salaries
 maamla hoicourt main jaataa he jahaan se inkaa regular hona radd ho jaataa he
 He goes to the Supreme Court after a long hearing and loses the case on 25 July 2017
 sarkaar kahati he ki inaki samasya kaa samaadhaan nikaalenge magar ek saal biit gaya
 At present, more than one hundred seventy thousand education friends are on the road
 unki naukari regular hui thi jo ab nahin he
 Salary was getting 40,000, which is now 10,000 only
 inaki samasya kaa samaadhaan kya nikalegaa kisi ko pataa nahin he
 i do not even know when it will come out
 jab tak ye 12 saal tak 3500 kii selary par padhaa rahe the tab kisi ko nahin laga ki ye bekaar hai ayogy hai, inhen nikaal dena chahie
 Most are ordinary boys
 aae din upi ke akhabaaron main chhapata rahata he ki sadame se shikshamitra kii maut ho gai, avsaad se maut ho gai, kisi ne aatmahatya kar lee to koi avsaad kaa shikaar ho gaya
 On 2 June, Mahesh Kumar, an education friend of Hapur, ended his life
 marane se pehle unhone zile ke sanghathan ke adhyaksh se poocha tha ki unka maandey kab aayega
 Education friends were not getting 10,000 since March in Hapur
 ye noujvaan cancer se jujh rahaa tha or dawa ke paise nahin the
 Its companions wept while telling its story
 jisaki tankhwaah 10,000 rupee ho or wo bhi teen maheene se kisi ko na mili to sochie uski haalat kya ho gai hogi
 There is no one in UP who is not aware of the problem of education friends
 kai saansadon or vidhayakon ne inaki samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye patr likhe hai
 In the 2017 Vidhan Sabha elections, the bjp's resolution letter states that the employment problem of all Shiksha Mitras of the state will be resolved in 3 months in a fair manner
 tab tak hoicourt ne inke regular kiye jane ke faisle ko nirast kar chukaa tha
 After the formation of the government, the decision of the Supreme Court comes, their job is canceled in that too
 18 sitambar 2015 ko banaras ke saansad ke netaa pradhanmantri modi ne do baar apane bhaashanon main shiksha mitron kaa zikr kiya he
 Listen and see why the promise was not resolved even after making a promise
 lakhanu main shiksha mitra 49 dinon se dharnarat hai
 Only the Prime Minister can tell whether he is with this education friends or not, whether he is talking to his yogi government on the solution of his problem
 ek lakh sattar hazaar logon kii naukari, selary or zindagi kaa masalaa ram bharose yaa kisi cameti bharose nahin choda ja saktaa he
 In his election speeches, Chief Minister Yogi also promised to take some steps for Shiksha Mitras
 pradhanmantri modi or mukhyamantri yogi kii jubaan kaa kya matlab rah jayega agar inaki samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin nikalataa he
 They should tell
 is vakt inhen 10,000 mil rahaa he jo nunatam mazaduri se kam he
 At least this injustice is done by calling the Prime Minister in the morning to get him away from the UP government
 pradhanmantri shikshak diwas ko kaaphi mahatv dete hai to phir ve kaise bardaasht kar sakate hai ki upi ke shiksha mitron ko nunatam mazdooree se kam or duusare rajyon se bhi kam selary mil rahi he
 Haryana gets 12 months salary and Rs 21,714 a month
 punjab main 12 maheene vetan miltaa he or ek maheene kaa 19,400 miltaa he
 Maharashtra gets 12 months salary and 35,000 a month
 ab aate hai supreme court ke faisle ke kuch hisse par
 We have not translated verbatim, decisions are not written in Hindi, but somehow i am presenting the essence of last steps
 supreme court ne apane aadesh main likhaa he ki 23 agast 2010 ke notification kii taarikh ke baad shikshakon kii niyukti ke liye jo nunatam paatrata tay kii gai he uske tahat shiksha mitra nahin aate hai, jiske kaaran unhen regular nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 No appointment can be made without this minimum eligibility and in this case the appointment is made after 2010
 shiksha mitron kii niyukti na sirf theke par hui thi balki shikshak banane kii paatrata yaa shikshak ko milane vaale maandey ke hisaab se bhi nahin hui thi
 Therefore they cannot be regularized as teachers
 supreme court ne jo apwaad swaroop faisle die hai wo maujuuda cese ke sandarbh main lagu nahin hote hai
 We believe that Shiksha Mitra was never appointed as a teacher nor does it come under the exemption granted under Section 23 (2) of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Act
 isliye bhi inaki niyukti nahin ho sakati he
 The state government does not have the right to grant exemption on its behalf
 tippaniyan On the one hand, we claim to have regularized 1 lakh 78 thousand people in violation of rules, on the other hand we have an obligation to uphold the rule of law
 hamen is baat kaa bhi sammaan rakhana he ki sarv shiksha abhiyaan ke tahat 6 se 14 saal ke bacchon ko uchit tareeke se prashikshit shikshakon se shiksha mili
 To understand the decision of the court, we are going to take the help of Faizan Mustafa Saheb, the constitution expert, to understand from him what are the chances and inconsistencies in this decision
 kya is faisle ke baad upi sarkaar ke adhikariyon or mantriyon ke paas koi rasta bachataa he yaa nahin bachataa he
 Is there any legal way left to Shiksha Mitras to withdraw his salary of 40,000 and become regular
 14 saal tak sarkaar ke lakshya ko puraa karne ke baad kya kisi ko aisa phenkaa ja saktaa he, 10,000 kaa maandey bhi asthaayee vyavastha he is paise par inkaa jivan kab tak chalegaa
 The Supreme Court has written in its judgment that even if the stop gap is temporarily kept for teaching someone, only qualified teacher will be appointed in the end
 adaalat ne stop gap shabd kaa istamaal kiya he, par aap sochie 2002 se 2014 tak ye log padhaate rahe
 Should the court consider 12 years of service as a stop gap, should there not have been compensation for that 12 years of service
 sarkaar kii niti or adaalat ke faisle kii sakht samiksha kii zarurat he taaki ek paimaana ban sake ki kisi se das bees saal kii seva lekar use niyamon or maapdandon kaa bahaanaa banaakar itani aasaani se chalata nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Today we are going to talk about education friends of Uttar Pradesh
 aisa nahin he ki media ne inaki baat nahin kii, sthaneey akhbaar shikshamitron ke andolan or pradarshnon se bhare pade hai
 News channels also showed but some solution to their problem is not known
 jabaki yah maamla sau do sau kaa nahin ek lakh 70,000 se adhik shiksha mitron kaa he
 In terms of numbers, think how big a matter it is, but no one knows what the solution will be
 lakhanu main 49 dinon se shiksha mitra dharne par baithe hai
 It has been difficult to calculate how much has been staged in the last one year
 inaki kahani is tarah se he ki 2002 se 2009 tak 1 lakh 78 hazaar shiksha mitra niyukt kiye jate hai
 To teach first and second grade children
 us vakt prashikshit shikshak nahin the to unki jagah inhen niyukt kiya gaya, kyonki desh main sakshartaa dar bahut kam thi
 The salary of these Shiksha Mitras was Rs 1850 in 2002, which reached 3500 before becoming regular in 2014
 itane kam paise par inhone 12 saal skulon main padhaayaa
 On 11 July 2011, the order of the UP government comes out that all these will be offered a BTC course through distance education from a government institution
 jab inaki niyukti hui thi tab bahut se inter paas the
 But most of them have obtained BA degree and BTC certificate too
 1 agast 2014 se inhen kareeb 40,000 vetan miltaa he
 The matter goes to the High Court from where their regularization gets canceled
 supreme court jate hai vahaan lambii sunwaayee ke baad 25 july 2017 ko cese haar jate hai
 The government says that they will solve their problem, but a year has passed
 is vakt ek lakh sattar hazaar se adhik shiksha mitra sadak par hai
 His job was regularized, which is no more
 selary 40,000 mil rahi thi, jo ab 10,000 hi mil rahi he
 No one knows what will solve their problem
 kab nikalegaa iskaa to or bhi pataa nahin
 While he was teaching at the salary of 3500 for 12 years, no one felt that they are useless, they should be discarded
 zyaadaatar saadhaaran gharon ke ladke hai
 It is published in the newspapers of UP that Shikamitra died due to shock, died of depression, someone committed suicide and someone became a victim of depression
 2 june ko hapur ke ek shiksha mitra mahesh kumaar kii zindagi samaapt ho gai
 Before dying, he had asked the president of the district organization when his honorarium would come
 hapur main shiksha mitron ko march se 10,000 bhi nahin mil rahaa tha
 This young man was battling cancer and had no money for medicine
 isaki kahani bataate hue iske saathi ro pade
 Whose salary is Rs 10,000 and if he does not get any for three months, then imagine what his condition would have been
 upi main aisa koi nahin jo shiksha mitron kii samasya se waakif na ho
 Many mps and mlas have written letters to address their problem
 2017 ke vidhaan sabha chunaavon main bhaajapa ke sankalp patr main likhaa he ki pradesh ke sabhi shiksha mitron kii rojgaar samasya ko 3 maheenon me nyyochit tareekon se suljhaayaa jayega
 By then the High Court had quashed the decision to make them regular
 sarkaar banane ke baad supreme court kaa faisla aata he usamen bhi inaki naukari nirast ho jaati he
 On 18 September 2015, Prime Minister Modi, the leader of the Banaras MP, has twice mentioned Shiksha Mitras in his speeches
 aap suniye or dekhie ki vaada karke baad bhi aakhir is samasya kaa samaadhaan kyon nahin niklaa
 Shiksha Mitra has been in Lucknow for 49 days
 pradhanmantri hi bataa sakate hai ki ve is shiksha mitron ke saath hai yaa nahin, apni yogi sarkaar se inaki samasya ke samaadhaan par baat kar rahe hai yaa nahin
 The issue of jobs, salary and life of one lakh seventy thousand people cannot be left to Ram's faith or any committee's trust
 mukhyamantri yogi ne bhi apane chunavi bhaashanon main shiksha mitron ke liye kuch kadam uthaane kaa aashwaasan diya tha
 What will be the meaning of the words of Prime Minister Modi and Chief Minister Yogi if their problem is not resolved
 unhen bataanaa chahie
 They are currently getting 10,000, which is less than the minimum wage
 kam se kam yahi ninsaphi pradhanmantri ji subah phone kar upi sarkaar se dur karvaa den
 The Prime Minister gives great importance to Teacher's Day, so how can they afford that up's education friends are getting less than minimum wages and less than other states
 haryana main 12 maheene vetan miltaa he or ek maheene kaa 21,714 rupee miltaa he
 Punjab gets 12 months salary and 19,400 a month
 maharashtra main 12 maheene vetan miltaa he or ek maheene kaa 35,000 miltaa he
 Now come to some part of the decision of the Supreme Court
 hamane shabdash anuwaad to nahin kiya he, hindi main faisle to likhe nahin jate magar kisi tarah aakhri pare kaa saar pesh kar rahaa hum
 The Supreme Court has written in its order that Shiksha Mitras do not fall under the minimum eligibility set for the appointment of teachers after the notification date of 23 August 2010, due to which they cannot be regularized
 is nunatam paatrata ke bagair koi niyukti nahin ho sakati he or is cese main niyukti 2010 ke baad hui he
 The appointment of Shiksha Mitras was not only on contract but also according to the eligibility to become a teacher or the honorarium paid to the teacher
 isliye inhen shikshak ke rup main niyamit nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The exceptions given by the Supreme Court are not applicable in the context of the present case
 hamaara maananaa he ki shiksha mitra kabhi bhi shikshak ke rup main niyukt nahin hue the or na hi ye sarv shiksha abhiyaan kanoon kii dhara 23(2) ke tahat mili chhot ke daayre main aate hai
 Therefore also they cannot be appointed
 rajya sarkaar ko apni taraf se chhot dene kaa adhikaar hasil nahin he
 The comments ek taraf hamaare saamne niyamon kaa ulanghan kar 1 lakh 78 hazaar logon ko niyamit kiye jane kaa daawa he to duusari taraf hamaara daayitv he ki ham kanoon ke raaj ko kaayam rakhen
 We also have to respect that under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, children between 6 and 14 years should get education from properly trained teachers
 adaalat ke faisle ko samajhane ke liye hamane samvidhan visheshgy faizan mustafaa sahab kii madad lene ja rahe hai unase samajhenge ki is faisle main kya guzaaish hai, kya visangityaan hai
 After this decision, is there any way left to the officials and ministers of UP government or not
 kya shiksha mitron ke paas koi kanoonee rasta bachaa he jisase ve apni 40,000 kii selary waapas le sakate hai or regular ho sakate hai
 After fulfilling the government's goal for 14 years, can anyone be thrown such, the honorarium of 10,000 is also a temporary arrangement, how long will their life last on this money
 supreme court ne apane faisle main likhaa he ki agar stop gap yani asthaayee taur par kisi ko padhaane ke liye rakhaa jaae to bhi ant main qualiphoid teacher kii hi niyukti hogi
 The court has used the term stop gap, but you think these people continued to teach from 2002 to 2014
 kya adaalat 12 saal kii seva ko stop gap maanati he, kya us 12 saal kii seva ke badale muawza nahin milanaa chahie tha
 Shiksha Mitras have been sitting on a dharna in Lucknow for 49 days
 pichley ek saal main kitna dharna de chuke hai, hisaab karnaa mushkil he

 After the formation of the government, the decision of the Supreme Court comes, their job is canceled in that too
 18 sitambar 2015 ko banaras ke saansad ke netaa pradhanmantri modi ne do baar apane bhaashanon main shiksha mitron kaa zikr kiya he
 Listen and see why the promise was not resolved even after making a promise
 lakhanu main shiksha mitra 49 dinon se dharnarat hai
 Only the Prime Minister can tell whether he is with this education friends or not, whether he is talking to his yogi government on the solution of his problem
 ek lakh sattar hazaar logon kii naukari, selary or zindagi kaa masalaa ram bharose yaa kisi cameti bharose nahin choda ja saktaa he
 In his election speeches, Chief Minister Yogi also promised to take some steps for Shiksha Mitras
 pradhanmantri modi or mukhyamantri yogi kii jubaan kaa kya matlab rah jayega agar inaki samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin nikalataa he
 They should tell
 is vakt inhen 10,000 mil rahaa he jo nunatam mazaduri se kam he
 At least this injustice is done by calling the Prime Minister in the morning to get him away from the UP government
 pradhanmantri shikshak diwas ko kaaphi mahatv dete hai to phir ve kaise bardaasht kar sakate hai ki upi ke shiksha mitron ko nunatam mazdooree se kam or duusare rajyon se bhi kam selary mil rahi he
 Haryana gets 12 months salary and Rs 21,714 a month
 punjab main 12 maheene vetan miltaa he or ek maheene kaa 19,400 miltaa he
 Maharashtra gets 12 months salary and 35,000 a month
 ab aate hai supreme court ke faisle ke kuch hisse par
 We have not translated verbatim, decisions are not written in Hindi, but somehow i am presenting the essence of last steps
 supreme court ne apane aadesh main likhaa he ki 23 agast 2010 ke notification kii taarikh ke baad shikshakon kii niyukti ke liye jo nunatam paatrata tay kii gai he uske tahat shiksha mitra nahin aate hai, jiske kaaran unhen regular nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 No appointment can be made without this minimum eligibility and in this case the appointment is made after 2010
 shiksha mitron kii niyukti na sirf theke par hui thi balki shikshak banane kii paatrata yaa shikshak ko milane vaale maandey ke hisaab se bhi nahin hui thi
 Therefore they cannot be regularized as teachers
 supreme court ne jo apwaad swaroop faisle die hai wo maujuuda cese ke sandarbh main lagu nahin hote hai
 We believe that Shiksha Mitra was never appointed as a teacher nor does it come under the exemption granted under Section 23 (2) of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Act
 isliye bhi inaki niyukti nahin ho sakati he
 The state government does not have the right to grant exemption on its behalf
 tippaniyan On the one hand, we claim to have regularized 1 lakh 78 thousand people in violation of rules, on the other hand we have an obligation to uphold the rule of law
 hamen is baat kaa bhi sammaan rakhana he ki sarv shiksha abhiyaan ke tahat 6 se 14 saal ke bacchon ko uchit tareeke se prashikshit shikshakon se shiksha mili
 To understand the decision of the court, we are going to take the help of Faizan Mustafa Saheb, the constitution expert, to understand from him what are the chances and inconsistencies in this decision
 kya is faisle ke baad upi sarkaar ke adhikariyon or mantriyon ke paas koi rasta bachataa he yaa nahin bachataa he
 Is there any legal way left to Shiksha Mitras to withdraw his salary of 40,000 and become regular
 14 saal tak sarkaar ke lakshya ko puraa karne ke baad kya kisi ko aisa phenkaa ja saktaa he, 10,000 kaa maandey bhi asthaayee vyavastha he is paise par inkaa jivan kab tak chalegaa
 The Supreme Court has written in its judgment that even if the stop gap is temporarily kept for teaching someone, only qualified teacher will be appointed in the end
 adaalat ne stop gap shabd kaa istamaal kiya he, par aap sochie 2002 se 2014 tak ye log padhaate rahe
 Should the court consider 12 years of service as a stop gap, should there not have been compensation for that 12 years of service
 is vakt ek lakh sattar hazaar se adhik shiksha mitra sadak par hai
 His job was regularized, which is no more
 selary 40,000 mil rahi thi, jo ab 10,000 hi mil rahi he
 No one knows what will solve their problem
 kab nikalegaa iskaa to or bhi pataa nahin
 While he was teaching at the salary of 3500 for 12 years, no one felt that they are useless, they should be discarded
 zyaadaatar saadhaaran gharon ke ladke hai
 It is published in the newspapers of UP that Shikamitra died due to shock, died of depression, someone committed suicide and someone became a victim of depression
 2 june ko hapur ke ek shiksha mitra mahesh kumaar kii zindagi samaapt ho gai
 Before dying, he had asked the president of the district organization when his honorarium would come
 hapur main shiksha mitron ko march se 10,000 bhi nahin mil rahaa tha
 This young man was battling cancer and had no money for medicine
 isaki kahani bataate hue iske saathi ro pade
 Whose salary is Rs 10,000 and if he does not get any for three months, then imagine what his condition would have been
 upi main aisa koi nahin jo shiksha mitron kii samasya se waakif na ho
 Many mps and mlas have written letters to address their problem
 2017 ke vidhaan sabha chunaavon main bhaajapa ke sankalp patr main likhaa he ki pradesh ke sabhi shiksha mitron kii rojgaar samasya ko 3 maheenon me nyyochit tareekon se suljhaayaa jayega
 By then the High Court had quashed the decision to make them regular
 sarkaar banane ke baad supreme court kaa faisla aata he usamen bhi inaki naukari nirast ho jaati he
 On 18 September 2015, Prime Minister Modi, the leader of the Banaras MP, has twice mentioned Shiksha Mitras in his speeches
 aap suniye or dekhie ki vaada karke baad bhi aakhir is samasya kaa samaadhaan kyon nahin niklaa
 Shiksha Mitra has been in Lucknow for 49 days
 pradhanmantri hi bataa sakate hai ki ve is shiksha mitron ke saath hai yaa nahin, apni yogi sarkaar se inaki samasya ke samaadhaan par baat kar rahe hai yaa nahin
 The issue of jobs, salary and life of one lakh seventy thousand people cannot be left to Ram's faith or any committee's trust
 mukhyamantri yogi ne bhi apane chunavi bhaashanon main shiksha mitron ke liye kuch kadam uthaane kaa aashwaasan diya tha
 What will be the meaning of the words of Prime Minister Modi and Chief Minister Yogi if their problem is not resolved
 unhen bataanaa chahie
 They are currently getting 10,000, which is less than the minimum wage
 kam se kam yahi ninsaphi pradhanmantri ji subah phone kar upi sarkaar se dur karvaa den
 The Prime Minister gives great importance to Teacher's Day, so how can they afford that up's education friends are getting less than minimum wages and less than other states
 haryana main 12 maheene vetan miltaa he or ek maheene kaa 21,714 rupee miltaa he
 Punjab gets 12 months salary and 19,400 a month
 maharashtra main 12 maheene vetan miltaa he or ek maheene kaa 35,000 miltaa he
 Now come to some part of the decision of the Supreme Court
 hamane shabdash anuwaad to nahin kiya he, hindi main faisle to likhe nahin jate magar kisi tarah aakhri pare kaa saar pesh kar rahaa hum
 The Supreme Court has written in its order that Shiksha Mitras do not fall under the minimum eligibility set for the appointment of teachers after the notification date of 23 August 2010, due to which they cannot be regularized
 is nunatam paatrata ke bagair koi niyukti nahin ho sakati he or is cese main niyukti 2010 ke baad hui he
 The appointment of Shiksha Mitras was not only on contract but also according to the eligibility to become a teacher or the honorarium paid to the teacher
 isliye inhen shikshak ke rup main niyamit nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The exceptions given by the Supreme Court are not applicable in the context of the present case
 hamaara maananaa he ki shiksha mitra kabhi bhi shikshak ke rup main niyukt nahin hue the or na hi ye sarv shiksha abhiyaan kanoon kii dhara 23(2) ke tahat mili chhot ke daayre main aate hai
 Therefore also they cannot be appointed
 rajya sarkaar ko apni taraf se chhot dene kaa adhikaar hasil nahin he
 The comments ek taraf hamaare saamne niyamon kaa ulanghan kar 1 lakh 78 hazaar logon ko niyamit kiye jane kaa daawa he to duusari taraf hamaara daayitv he ki ham kanoon ke raaj ko kaayam rakhen
 We also have to respect that under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, children between 6 and 14 years should get education from properly trained teachers
 adaalat ke faisle ko samajhane ke liye hamane samvidhan visheshgy faizan mustafaa sahab kii madad lene ja rahe hai unase samajhenge ki is faisle main kya guzaaish hai, kya visangityaan hai
 After this decision, is there any way left to the officials and ministers of UP government or not
 kya shiksha mitron ke paas koi kanoonee rasta bachaa he jisase ve apni 40,000 kii selary waapas le sakate hai or regular ho sakate hai
 After fulfilling the government's goal for 14 years, can anyone be thrown such, the honorarium of 10,000 is also a temporary arrangement, how long will their life last on this money
 supreme court ne apane faisle main likhaa he ki agar stop gap yani asthaayee taur par kisi ko padhaane ke liye rakhaa jaae to bhi ant main qualiphoid teacher kii hi niyukti hogi
 The court has used the term stop gap, but you think these people continued to teach from 2002 to 2014
 kya adaalat 12 saal kii seva ko stop gap maanati he, kya us 12 saal kii seva ke badale muawza nahin milanaa chahie tha
 On 2 June, Mahesh Kumar, an education friend of Hapur, ended his life
 marane se pehle unhone zile ke sanghathan ke adhyaksh se poocha tha ki unka maandey kab aayega
 Education friends were not getting 10,000 since March in Hapur
 ye noujvaan cancer se jujh rahaa tha or dawa ke paise nahin the
 Its companions wept while telling its story
 jisaki tankhwaah 10,000 rupee ho or wo bhi teen maheene se kisi ko na mili to sochie uski haalat kya ho gai hogi
 There is no one in UP who is not aware of the problem of education friends
 kai saansadon or vidhayakon ne inaki samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye patr likhe hai
 In the 2017 Vidhan Sabha elections, the bjp's resolution letter states that the employment problem of all Shiksha Mitras of the state will be resolved in 3 months in a fair manner

 The Supreme Court has written in its judgment that even if the stop gap is temporarily kept for teaching someone, only qualified teacher will be appointed in the end
 adaalat ne stop gap shabd kaa istamaal kiya he, par aap sochie 2002 se 2014 tak ye log padhaate rahe
 Should the court consider 12 years of service as a stop gap, should there not have been compensation for that 12 years of service
 ab aate hai supreme court ke faisle ke kuch hisse par
 We have not translated verbatim, decisions are not written in Hindi, but somehow i am presenting the essence of last steps
 supreme court ne apane aadesh main likhaa he ki 23 agast 2010 ke notification kii taarikh ke baad shikshakon kii niyukti ke liye jo nunatam paatrata tay kii gai he uske tahat shiksha mitra nahin aate hai, jiske kaaran unhen regular nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 No appointment can be made without this minimum eligibility and in this case the appointment is made after 2010
 shiksha mitron kii niyukti na sirf theke par hui thi balki shikshak banane kii paatrata yaa shikshak ko milane vaale maandey ke hisaab se bhi nahin hui thi
 Therefore they cannot be regularized as teachers
 supreme court ne jo apwaad swaroop faisle die hai wo maujuuda cese ke sandarbh main lagu nahin hote hai
 We believe that Shiksha Mitra was never appointed as a teacher nor does it come under the exemption granted under Section 23 (2) of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Act
 isliye bhi inaki niyukti nahin ho sakati he
 The state government does not have the right to grant exemption on its behalf
 tippaniyan On the one hand, we claim to have regularized 1 lakh 78 thousand people in violation of rules, on the other hand we have an obligation to uphold the rule of law
 hamen is baat kaa bhi sammaan rakhana he ki sarv shiksha abhiyaan ke tahat 6 se 14 saal ke bacchon ko uchit tareeke se prashikshit shikshakon se shiksha mili
 To understand the decision of the court, we are going to take the help of Faizan Mustafa Saheb, the constitution expert, to understand from him what are the chances and inconsistencies in this decision
 kya is faisle ke baad upi sarkaar ke adhikariyon or mantriyon ke paas koi rasta bachataa he yaa nahin bachataa he
 Is there any legal way left to Shiksha Mitras to withdraw his salary of 40,000 and become regular
 14 saal tak sarkaar ke lakshya ko puraa karne ke baad kya kisi ko aisa phenkaa ja saktaa he, 10,000 kaa maandey bhi asthaayee vyavastha he is paise par inkaa jivan kab tak chalegaa

 ek taraf hamaare saamne niyamon kaa ulanghan kar 1 lakh 78 hazaar logon ko niyamit kiye jane kaa daawa he to duusari taraf hamaara daayitv he ki ham kanoon ke raaj ko kaayam rakhen
 We also have to respect that under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, children between 6 and 14 years should get education from properly trained teachers
 adaalat ke faisle ko samajhane ke liye hamane samvidhan visheshgy faizan mustafaa sahab kii madad lene ja rahe hai unase samajhenge ki is faisle main kya guzaaish hai, kya visangityaan hai
 After this decision, is there any way left to the officials and ministers of UP government or not
 kya shiksha mitron ke paas koi kanoonee rasta bachaa he jisase ve apni 40,000 kii selary waapas le sakate hai or regular ho sakate hai
 After fulfilling the government's goal for 14 years, can anyone be thrown such, the honorarium of 10,000 is also a temporary arrangement, how long will their life last on this money
 supreme court ne apane faisle main likhaa he ki agar stop gap yani asthaayee taur par kisi ko padhaane ke liye rakhaa jaae to bhi ant main qualiphoid teacher kii hi niyukti hogi
 The court has used the term stop gap, but you think these people continued to teach from 2002 to 2014
 kya adaalat 12 saal kii seva ko stop gap maanati he, kya us 12 saal kii seva ke badale muawza nahin milanaa chahie tha

 The fast-paced wicketkeeping world of former Indian cricket team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is convincing
 36 saal ke dhoni ravivaar ko vanade main 100 stump karne vaale duniya ke pehle wicketiper ban gaye
 He achieved this feat in the fifth and last ODI of the series against Sri Lanka
 dhoni ne apane kariyar ke 301wein vanade main is jaadui aankade ko chuaa
 Sri Lankan batsman Akila Dhananjay became Dhoni's 100th victim
 gendbaaj yajuvendra chahal rahe
 Earlier Dhoni stumped 99th in the second ODI of the series
 tab dhoni ne apane 298wein vanade main danushka gunathilka ko stump kar srilankai diggaj kumaar sangakaara (99 stamping) kii bakabari kii thi
 Even then bowler Yajuvendra Chahal remained
 vanade main sarvaadhik stamping kii baat karen, to dhoni ne abtak 2004 se 2017 ke dauraan 100 stump kiye hai

 com / fub5l5v7re— Virat Kohli (@cricvids1)september 3, 2017 The fourth phase of Lok Sabha elections has been completed and there is 3 more voting in this seven-phase election
 pichley chaar charnon main pashchim bengal kii 42 main 18 siton par voting ho chuki he or chaaron baar soobe kii janata ne badi taadaad main apane gharon se nikalakar vot diya he
 Incidents of violence have also been frequent among bumper voting in Bengal
 baavjood iske matadaataaon ke josh ko kam karne main yah naakaam sabit hui hai
 In West Bengal, however, the voting percentage remains high and if we talk about the last two Lok Sabha elections, then it has the highest number of votes compared to other states of the country
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bengal main 81
 40 per cent of the votes were cast and the state also had 82 in the Modi wave
 17 fisadi janata ne apane matadhikaar kaa istemaal kiya tha
 The bumper voting of Bengal shows that the cadre of various parties stands firmly with their leaders here
 bheeshan garmi or hinsa kii ghatnaayen bhi bengal kii janata kaa manobal todane main naakaafi rahati hai
 Bumper voting and more violence In the first phase, 81 percent voting was done in 2 seats of Bengal and in the second phase 81 seats in 3 seats
 68 fisadi vot pade
 Also 79 in 5 seats in the third phase
 36 voting hui or somvaar ko chauthe charan main rajya kii 8 siton par vot daale gaye
 76 of Bengal also in this fourth phase
 66 votaron ne apni-apni party ke paksh main matdaan kiya
 In the elections held so far, the state has had an average voting percentage of 80 per cent
 pichley chaaron hi charnon main soobe ke vibhinn ilaakon se hinsa kii ghatnaayen bhi dekhne ko milin
 In the fourth phase, there was a clash between TMC and BJP supporters in the bjp-occupied Asansol seat
 yahaan tak ki kendriya mantri or bijepi saansad babul supriyo ke khilaaf FIR tak darj karai gai he
 Both TMC and BJP have filed complaints against each other in the Election Commission amid the fourth phase of voting
 duusari ore veerbhum jile se bhi updrav kii ghatnaayen saamne ai hai
 Whereas earlier in the third phase, the convoy of CPM MP Mohammad Salim was attacked in Islampur during voting
 yahaan chunavi hinsa kaa itihaas purana he, haal hi main sampann hue nikaay chunaav iskaa sabase bada udhaaharan sabit hue the
 For the Modi government that came to power with an absolute majority in the last Lok Sabha election, Bengal is no less than a litmus test
 pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah khud bengal par paini najar banaae hue hai
 The party claims that this time in the state they will get more seats than before
 bengal main kul 42 loksabhaa siten hai or pichley baar tiemasi ko yahaan 36 siton par jeet mili thi
 Apart from this, the Congress was reduced to only 4 and Left 2 seats
 bijepi ko tab 2 siten mili thim lekin is chunaav main party 20 se zyada siten jeetne kaa target rakhaa he
 After the BJP gained power at the Center, Tripura, the oldest stronghold of the Left, collapsed and won the assembly elections there and created history by creating a government alone
 ab bijepi kaa focus odisha or bengal jaise rajyon par he, jahaan kshetreey dalon kaa dabadabaa rahaa he
 The political battle between Modi Vs Mamtamodi and Mamta is not hidden from anyone
 centre main baithi sarkaar par agar koi netaa sabase tikhe hamale ke liye janaa jaataa he to uskaa naam mamata banerjee hi he
 In 2014, BJP got only 2 Lok Sabha seats in Bengal, but the party has strengthened its organization here in the last 5 years
 iskaa nateeja he ki bijepi rajya main chauthe number se duusare number kii party bengal main ban gai he
 At the same time, whether it is the issue of Bangladeshi infiltrators or the NRC, the swords are already drawn between the two parties on all such burning issues
 haalanki tiemasi pramukh mamata banerjee bengal main bijepi ke liye koi bhi spes nahin dena chaahati hai
 This is the reason that activists of both parties go to the vote with the intention of strengthening their leader and witness their passion towards the party making it an increasing voting percentage
 kaha yah bhi ja rahaa he ki uttar pradesh, madhya pradesh, gujarat or rajasthan jaise rajyon se hone vaali nuksaan kii bharpai ke liye bijepi ne bengal-odisha ko chunaa he
 The BJP had won huge support and seats in the 2014 elections from all these states, but it will prove challenging to repeat it this time
 aise main bijepi kii ranneeti he ki in rajyon main agar siton kaa nuksaan hota he to bengal jaise rajya main behatar pradarshan kar uski bharpai kii ja sake
 For this, clear messages have also been given to the workers
 desh, duniya, mahanagar, khel, aarthik or bollywood main kya kuch hua

 There has been a controversy over a new song by Punjabi singer Sidhu Musewala

 Regarding this, religious organizations in Punjab have demanded registration of FIR against Sidhu Musewala for hurting religious sentiments under 295A
 haalanki sikh sanghathanon ke virodh ke baad siddhu muusayvaala ne apane fasebuk pej par ek video jari karke maafee maang lee or puure vivaad ko khatm karne kii koshish kii he

 The Modi government has fully committed to declare triple talaq as punishment for the same
 centre sarkaar ne guuruuvaar ko ‘da muslim vimen protection of ritis in marij act’ bill loksabhaa main pesh kiya
 If Muslim organizations are angry about this bill, the Modi government is calling it a historic step for the empowerment of Muslim women
 desh kii tamaam muslim mahilaon se ajtak ne teen talaak ke khilaaf laae ja rahe bill ko lekar baat kii
 Muslim women protest against three divorces in unison, but do not even want to see the husband go to jail
 lekin teen talaak par puri tarah se pabandi lage iske liye kanoon banane kii paksh main jarur khadi najar aa rahi hai
 Ujma Parveen, studying at Aligarh Muslim University and working in an NGO in Delhi, says, "it is a matter of pleasure if the government is bringing a new law for the betterment of Muslim women
" sarkaar komuslim mahilaon kii madadke liye kanoon bananaa chahie na ki mushkilen paidaa karne vaala
 If a law is being brought without consultation, it is just like imposing it
 'ujama parveen ne kaha ki vidheyak main jis tarah ke praavdhaanon kii baat saamne aa rahi he, usamen kai chizon par apatti he
 Action has been said on the third party's complaint
 iske alaava koi pati agar teen talaak de detaa he, to shaadi khatm nahin hogi
 But the husband will be punished
 aise condishan main patni or bacchon kii dekhbhaal kaise hogi
 If the government really wants the betterment of Muslim women, then after the open discussion, legal implementation should be done
 patrakarita kii padhai kar rahi neha farhin kahati he ki muslim mahilaon ke haq main teen talaak ek buraai kii tarah he
 In Muslim society people are divorcing their wives on small matters
 aise main teen talaak par kadaa kanoon banaaya janaa chahie, taaki puri tarah se is par roak lag sake
 Apart from this, women should get equal rights, so that they can live in society with full respect
 handicraft export kaarobaar kar raheen rana khan kahati hai,teen talaak islam kaa hissaahi nahin he
 The government is making laws
 isse pati patni ke bich talaak ke baad jo sulah kii gujainsh rahati he, wo bhi khatm ho jaaegi
 The government should not interfere in our Sharia
 muslim mahilaon ke utthan ke liye sarkaar kadam uthaae, na ki raajnneetik laabh ke liye
 Afroz, who hails from Unchahar in Uttar Pradesh, says that the triple talaq is against Sharia
 is par puri tarah se pabandi lagani chahie
 Legislation should be made for this, but after talking to women and ulema of Muslim community, Modi government should take any step
 raibareli kii rahane vaali peshey se teacher sabiha parveen ansaari kahati hai ki teen talaak se muslim mahilaon kii jindagi barbaad ho rahi he
 It should be banned
 iske liye kanoon banaae janaa chahie, lekin sharia kii roshni main ho na kii sharia ke khilaaf
 Atikunisha of Najibabad says that triple talaq should be banned, because even Islam does not consider it right
 kanoon ke bajaae saamaajik jaagrukta ke jariye is tarah kii jo khamiyaan hai, unhen dur kiya jaae
 The law that the government is bringing, if someone gives three divorces, then he should be jailed
 aise main parivaar ke saamne dikkatein khadi hongi
 Better than punishment, the wife should be made a partner in the husband's property
 dilli ke jamiya millia islamia vishvavidhyalay ke itihaas vibhaag se eme kar rahi sadaf javed kahati hai ki teen talaak islamic sharia ke khilaaf he
 The way the Modi government is introducing the bill, it is also not correct
 is mudde par muslim personal lau board sahit sabhi se charchaa honi chahie
 Introducing bills in haste will complicate problems rather than solve them

 He wrote many songs for Hindi films
 gopaldaas niraj kaa janm (gopal Das Neeraj Birthday) 4 janvari 1925 ko uttar pradesh ke itawa jile ke puravali gaanv main hua tha
 People still remember Neeraj for his famous songs written by him
 unhone bollywood ke liye kai superhit gane likhen, jinhen log aaj bhi gunagunaate hai
 Today, on the occasion of Gopal Das Neeraj Birth Anniversary, we are telling you 10 things related to his life
 cricket kii duniya main pakistan ko aisi team ke taur par janaa jaataa he jo kabhi shandaar pradarshan karti he, to kabhi behad kharaab
 But he has many players who are capable of reversing the match on their own and this makes them one of the most attractive teams in the World Cup starting May 30
 1992 main world cap kaa khitaab jeetne vaali pakistani team lagaataar 10 vanade match ganvaakar yahaan pahunchi he
 The poor form of the team can also be gauged from the fact that Afghanistan also defeated them in the practice match
 pakistan world cap kii taiyaariyon ke maddenjar ek maheene pehle hi england pahunch gaya
 But in the ODI series, England beat him 4–0 and raised his concerns
 isse pehle dubai main pakistan ko australia ne 5-0 se haraaya tha
 The team won their last ODI against South Africa in January

 The team was not in rhythm even before the 1992 World Cup
 aise pradarshan ke baad bhi koi team use halke main nahin lenaa chaahegi, kyonki team ne england kii inhen paristhitiyon main 2017 main champiens trophy kaa khitaab jeeta tha
 To return to victory, Pakistan will have to improve their fielding and bowling
 team ke coach miki arthur bhi ise chintaa kaa kaaran bataa chuke hai
 In the two matches against England, the team could not defend the target of 358 and 340 runs, while in two other matches, the bowlers also gave away more than 350 runs
 team ke liye acchhee baat yah he ki ballebaaj lay main he or england kii paristhitiyon se main acha kar rahe hai

 He has appealed to the Congress Ministers to listen to the Congress workers and office bearers

 Sonia said that there should be better communication between the government and the Congress party even further

 This cold war of the Grand Alliance in Uttar Pradesh has become more apparent after ticket distribution
 congress ne apane muslim pratyaashiyon ke sahare dalit-muslim gathjod ke dam par dilli kaa khwab sanjone vaale basapa-sapa gathbandhan par gaharaa aghat kiya he
 There are four such Lok Sabha seats in West UP alone, where the Muslim candidates of the Congress, especially BSP supremo, may prove to be harmful for Mayawati
 muradabad, bijanour, saharanpur or amroha chaar aise loksabhaa kshetra hai, jahaan se congress ne muslim chehron ko mauka diya he
 Imran Pratapgadi from Moradabad, Nasimuddin Siddiqui from Bijnor, Imran Masood from Saharanpur and Rashid Alvi from Amroha have been given tickets
 ye chaaron sirf pratyaashee bhar nahin hai, balki inaki apni alag khaas pahchaan bhi he
 Imran Pratapgarhi is a famous poet and his craze is quite popular among the masses
 nasimuddin siddiki kabhi mayawati ke rhite hand kahe jate the, or lambey arase tak unhone basapa main number do kii bhoomika main rahete hue kaam kiya
 Imran Masood has emerged as the most vocal face of the Congress in West UP
 haalanki, unke talkh bayaan puure desh main vivaad kaa centre bane hai
 Being a national spokesperson, Rashid Alvi carries his identity across the country
 yani in netaaon kaa kad is baat kii ore ishaara kar rahaa he ki yahaan gathbandhan ke ummidavaaron ko jhatka lag saktaa he
 Senior journalist Yusuf Ansari, who has a special hold on UP politics, told Aaj Tak that doing so is an important part of the Congress strategy
 mayawati congress par lagaataar hamale kar rahi thim, jiske baad congress ne apni ranneeti badali or jin siton par jeetne kii ummid he, vahaan muslim ummidavaaron ko utaarne kaa faisla kiya
 According to Yusuf Ansari, in the Lok Sabha seats that have more than 20 per cent Muslim population, and there is no Muslim candidate for the alliance, the Congress has adopted a strategy to field its strong Muslim candidate
 lekin amroha se basapa ummidavaar danish ali ke khilaaf congress kaa ummidavaar utaarna uske iraadon or majbootee detaa he
 According to Yusuf Ansari, the Congress has taken some decisions with the intention of teaching a lesson to the BSP only after seeing Mayawati's tough stance, a decision has also been taken against Amroha candidate Danish Ali, who is close to the Congress, to field Rashid Alvi
 bijanour seat se congress pratyaashee nasimuddin siddikito kya congress kii yah stretage gathbandhan or khaskar basapa ko vaaki nuksaan pahunchaa sakati he, ab ye bada sawaal he
 If we look at the equations of these four seats, then there may be adverse circumstances for the alliance
 in chaaron loksabhaa kshetron main musalmaan vot na sirf nirnaayak bhoomika main he, balki vah netritv karata bhi najar aata he
 Moradabad seat is 45 per cent, Bijnor seat 38 per cent, Saharanpur seat 39 per cent and Amroha seat 37 per cent Muslim
 bijanour loksabhaa seat par congress ne pehle ek gurjar netaa indira bhaati ko ummidavaar banaaya tha, lekin basapa ne bhi gurjar netaa maluk nagar ko mauka de diya
 On the other hand, BJP again reposed trust in sitting MP Kunwar Bharatendra
 gathbandhan kaa hindu ummidavaar dekh congress ne apana faisla badal liya or nasimuddin siddiki ko ummidavaar bana diya
 The main reason for this is the 5 lakh Muslim voters here
 jabaki basapa ummidavaar maluk nagar kii najar 1 lakh gurjar or 3 lakh dalit matadaata par he
 Maluk Nagar is a Gurjar, but his society's vote has been going to the BJP
 duusari taraf shivpal yadav kii pragatisheel samaajapaadi party ne ilam singh gurjar ko chunaav maidan main utaara he
 In such a situation, the Congress has not only shocked the BSP by taking down a leader like Nasimuddin Siddiqui, but has also strengthened his chances of victory
 musalamaanon kii aadhi aabaadi muradabad main bhi gathbandhan ke liye musiibat ban sakati he
 In Moradabad seat, the Congress had declared State UP President Raj Babbar as a candidate, but when BJP gave its sitting MP Kunwar Sarvesh a chance again and the possibility of any SP-BSP alliance was over, the Congress immediately made its decision
 Withdrew and gave a chance to the famous poet Imran Pratapgarhi
 gathbandhan main yah seat sapa ke khate main gai he, lekin abhi tak pratyaashee kaa naam final nahin kiya gaya he
 Around 45 per cent Muslims are here
 ab tak is seat par hue 17 chunaavon main se 11 baar muslim pratyaashiyon ne yahaan se baaji maari he
 Congress star Azharuddin has also won this seat in 2009
 aise main congress ne ek baar phir imran pratapgadhi ke rup main mashhoor chehre ko is seat se utaara he
 Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood is likewise a star candidate of Congress in Saharanpur seat, whose name is Imran Masood
 puraane raajnneetik parivaar se taalluk rakhane vaale imran masood ko 2014 main modi lahar ke bajwood 34 fisadi vot mili the, jabaki bijepi se jeetne vaale raghav lakhanpal ko 39 fisadi mat praapt hue the or basapa mahaj 19 fisadi vot par simat gai thi
 Now the SP-BSP alliance has given a chance to Haji Fazlur Rahman from the Saharanpur region with 39 percent population
 aise main is baar saharanpur seat kii ladaai trikoniya mukaable main badalati najar aa rahi he, haalanki haji fajalurrahman kii svachh chhavi unka padala baari kar rahi he
 Exactly, a tough contest is also seen in the Amroha seat, where 37 percent Muslims are there
 jedies chhodkar basapa main shaamil hue kunwar danish ali amroha seat se chunaav lard rahe hai, lekin congress ne rashiv alvi ko utarkar unki chunauti badha di he
 The two leaders are seen arguing together on national TV
 raashid alvi saansad bhi rah chuke hai
 In such a situation, the fight of these two can also give a big chance to the BJP
 amroha seat se congress pratyaashee raashid alviek or bada sawaal ye he ki kya musalmaan matadaata bijepi ke khilaaf bane sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke saamne congress ummidavaar ko vot karegaa
 On this, senior journalist Yusuf Ansari believes that the trend of Muslims towards the Congress has increased and the main reason for this is the lack of trust in Mayawati
 unke mutabik, muslim samaaj main ye soch ubhar rahi he ki kahin chunaav ke baad vah mayawati bijepi ke saath na chali jaae
 In such a situation, a Muslim can choose a strong Muslim candidate for Congress in front of the alliance of Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav
 dilli main aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ke hatane ke aath maheenon ke baad ab raashtrapati ne uparajyapal najeeb jang ko is baat kii ijaajat di he ki vahasarkaar bananeke liye bijepi ko bulaaen
 The BJP was also the largest party in the House earlier and had not shown any interest in forming the government at that time
 is vajah se sadan nilamban kii sthiti main tha
 Now, after the victory in two other states, the BJP leadership has started thinking that it would be better to have a government after holding elections again here
 jaahir he ki raashtrapati ne usee ichha ke anuroop apni ijaajat de di he
 Delhi Assembly has a total of 70 seats, out of which 31 were won by BJP but three of its mlas became mps and by-elections are to be held in those constituencies
 use lagata he ki in upachunaav main uski jeet hogi
 Probably due to this belief, the party now wants to form its government in the state
 udhar, duusari sabase badi party aam aadmi party kaa is maamle main rukh badalata rahaa
 At first she proposed to dissolve the Vidhan Sabha but later she turned back from this stand
 usne uparajyapal ko likhaa ki vah sadan ko bhang na karen
 Now the BJP has stood up to form the government and has got the green signal of the Lieutenant Governor
 jaahir he jab vah sarkaar banaaegi to kaaphi khinchataan hogi or vidhayakon ke kharid-farokht ke aarope lagenge jaisaa pichley dinon lage the
 The Aam Aadmi Party made such allegations many times
 baharhaal, ab dilli main sarkaar banane kii kavayad shuru hui he or bijepi ko kaaphi papad belane padenge kyonki yah utana aasaan nahin he
 He has the support of an Akali MLA besides his mlas
 dekhnaa yah he ki party is gap ko kaise bharegi
 It will have to take the support of independent mlas and this is not very difficult because the truth is that no legislator wants elections so soon
 arvind kejariwal bhale hi lambey-chaude daawey kar len, lekin unki party ke hi zyaadaatar vidhayak chunaav se bhaag rahe hai
 Perhaps this is the only point that will help BJP to form government
 congress ke netaa bhale hi iske khilaaf aawaaj uthaaen lekin unhen pataa he ki agar chunaav hue to naav dub bhi sakati he
 The condition of the party in the metropolis is so bad that it would be a costly deal for him to contest immediately
 vaise bhi ve satta main aane vaale to nahin the
 Now, if elections are held, then the prestigious post of MLA can also go
 lekin in sab ke bich supreme court ke vaazib sawaal kaa kendra sarkaar ke paas kya jawaab he ki aakhir yah faisla karne main itnaa vakt kyon laga? The Aam Aadmi Party, which landed in Delhi for the first time in the election season, has performed miraculously
 lekin 'aap' kii hi tarah purv main kai nai partiyon ne chunaav main behtareen pradarshan kiya he
 Talking about the political parties formed during the last thirty years, the leaders of those parties who did not belong to any political party, the performance of their party has been excellent
 bhartiya rajasav seva chhodkar raajnneeti main utre arvind kejariwal ke netritv main pehali baar mukaable main utari 'aap' ne shandaar pradarshan karte hue congress ko dilli main tisare sthaan par dhakel diya

 Demonetisation had already done badly to farmers

 yahaan sadak tomaataron se ati padi thi
 On the way, bike riders were sliding on tomatoes
 yahaan koi spain jaisatomato festivalanheen ho rahaa tha
 Rather it was a result of the helplessness of the farmers
 kisaanon ko tomaataron ko sadak par hi phenkna pad rahaa he kyonki inhen mitti ke mol lene ke liye bhi kharidaar nahin mil rahe
 After selling 20-25 paise per kg tomatoes, the farmers are throwing them on the road instead of taking them home

 After tomatoes and oranges, pea-producing farmers have also broken their back
 matar kaa utpaadan to bahut hua lekin notebandi kii vajah se kisaanon kii sari ummiido par pani phir gaya
 The condition is that the farmers are allowing the peas to remain in the field
 unka kahana he ki matar ko tudwane or phir use mandi le janaa unke boote main nahin he
 The cost of farmers is more than the cost of peas
 gwalior main kisaanon ko matar ke daam ek rupaya kilo bhi nahin mil paa rahe
 Farmer Mohan Singh of Panihar village said that 3 quintals of seeds were planted for peas in 6 bighas of land

 unhone prashn uthaaya he ki kaise centre sarkaar ne collegium kii ore se bheji gai list par faisla lene se pehle sijeai deepak mishra se charchaa tak nahin kii
 Speaking to the Indian Express, former Chief Justice of India RM Lodha said, 'this is an attack on the heart of the independence of the judiciary
 'collegium kii siforeeshon ko pehle kai hafton tak atkaaye rakhana or phir usamen se sirf ek naam ko chunanaa, ek nae prachlan ko dikhaata he
 It is as if the government is choosing its favorable name and is prohibiting the names of those who are not favorable
 ye nyaaypalika main hastkshep he
 Former Chief Justice RM Lodhane said, in such a situation, CJI Deepak Mishra should call a collegium meeting with immediate effect and talk to the government on the issue
 'justise lodha ne kaha, mere kaarykaal ke dauraan 2014 main bhi aisa hi hua tha
 The government then cleared the name of former Solicitor General Gopal Subramaniam, bypassing the 4 names of the panel sent to the Supreme Court for appointment of judges
 tab main desh se baahar tha
 After this, i expressed my displeasure by writing a letter to the then Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad

 Justices Lodha said, the recent developments have sent the wrong message

 mujhe andeh he ki kya unhone is bayaan se pehle collegium main apane sahyogiyon se paraamarsh liya he
 Justice Shah said, it is clear that Justice Joseph's name was withheld because he gave a verdict against the Center in 2016
 vah is pad ke liye sabase upyukt vyakti he
 Justic Shah also criticized the CJI for not talking to the central government in this regard

 Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi has demanded simultaneous elections for both the Rajya Sabha seats in Gujarat
 singhvi ne daawa kiya ki unhen vishwasaneey sutron se khabar mili he ki chunaav ayog donon siton par alag-alag samay chunaav karaane par vichaar kar rahaa he
 Abhishek Manu Singhvi said it would be unconstitutional not to hold simultaneous elections in both the Rajya Sabha seats vacated after the resignation of Amit Shah and Smriti Irani from the Election Commission
 abhishek manu singhvi ne kaha ki ham chunaav ayog se amit shah or smriti irani kii seat par ek saath chunaav karaane kaa anurodh karnaa chaahate hai, bajaay iske ki do alag-alag samay par chunaav hon
 If simultaneous elections are held, one seat can win the ruling party and one seat opposition
 agar alag-alag samay par chunaav hue to yah galat hoga
 Singhvi said that the Congress party would take up the issue with the Election Commission
 sonia gandhi kii ore se loksabhaa chunaavon par andeh jataane ke sawaal par singhvi ne kaha ki ham is bare main ek sire se koi bada bayaan nahin dena chaahate lekin itnaa jarur kahana chaahate hai ki chunaav ayog ne jitna mahatv satta paksh ko diya utana vipaksh ko nahin diya
 Singhvi said that 80 percent of the parties cast doubt on the electronic voting machine and the issue was also placed before the Election Commission
 ham ye nahin kah rahe ki iviem ko puri tarah se khaarij kar diya jaae balki ise vivipat se link karne kii hamaari maang he

 ) Nurse Bhanwari Devi first became the means of wishing those people, but later when her ambitions arose and she started demanding 'haq' in return, she was killed by the same people
 bhavari devi kii hatya ke maamle main kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) kii ore se pehali march ko daakhil duusari chargeshit kaa nishkarsh kuch isi shakl main saamne aayaa he
 She was an assistant nurse
 pichley saal 1 sitambar ko vah laapata ho gai
 It was reported that she was blackmailing the state's Public Health Engineering Minister Mahipal Maderna and Congress MLA Malkhan Singh Bishnoi
 in donon ke saath uske avaidh sex sambandhon vaali video sidi kathith rup se uske kabje main hone kii baat saarvajanik hone par vah gaayab hui thi
 Maderna was removed from the government as soon as the CBI took up the case
 unhen or congress vidhayak malakhan ko giraftaar karke jail bhej diya gaya
 The charge sheet states that the entire story began in 2002 when Bhanwari met Malkhan in connection with his transfer
 unke bich kaa avaidh shaareerik sambandh prem main tabdeel hota dikhaa
 Malkhan is the son of Ram Singh Bishnoi, a prominent leader of the region and a minister in the previous Congress government in the state
 malakhan se bhavari ko ek beti bhi hui, jo uski duusari beti he
 Meanwhile, Malkhan met him with his deep friend Congress leader Mahipal Maderna
 malakhan kii jaankaree main hi maderna bhi bhavari ke saath sex main lipt rahane lage
 The matter really started to deteriorate from there when Bhanwari started taking morcha to her Malkhan-born daughter
 vidhansabha yaa sthaneey nikaay ke chunaavon main bhavari ko tikat nahin mila to use yah andeshaa sataane laga ki malakhan kahin use darkinar na kar de
 He started harassing her in public places and even complained against her in the police
 malakhan kaa parivaar bhavari ko lekar gusse main tha
 And slowly Malkhan also started to distance from him
 usne bhai parsaram bishnoi or bahan indra bishnoi ko bhavari ke sampark main rahane ko kaha, jisase ki use shant karaayaa ja sake
 Malkhan used to spend a lot of money on Bhanwari
 dhire-dhire bhavari ne mukhar hona shuru kar diya
 He tells Malkhan and his family that he has a CD containing footage of Malkhan's sex relationship with him
 is tarah ke khatre ko bhaanpakar bishnoi parivaar ne bhavari ke gusse ko maderna kii ore modane kaa faisla kiya
 She was advised that if she made a CD of her sex relationship with Maderna, she could earn a lot of money
 yah sab isliye kiya ja rahaa tha ki jaal main funskar maderna jab mantri pad se haath dho baithen to malakhan ko mantri banane kaa mauka mil jaae
 In the December 2008 assembly elections, there was a tussle between these two friends, fond of Sura and Sundari
 bhavari or indra ne pehle to bhavari kii nanad gudiya ke saath maderna ke sex sambandhon kii sidi banane kii koshish kii lekin gudiya ne inkaar kar diya
 After this, Bhanwari decided that she would prepare a CD of her sex relationship with Maderna
 jaipur main rajasthan paryaton vikaas nigam (artidisi) ke hotel gangaur main usne vah sidi banaai bhi lekin vahaan chhipaae gaye camere kaa kone thik na rakh paane se film thik na ban pai
 Later more films were also made
 inhen main se ek maderna ke jodhpur ke paas jhalmond sthit farmahouse main bani
 The CBI says that a CD was also owned by Malkhan Singh but was destroyed before he could get his hands on it
 bishnoiyon kaa ek samooh pehle malakhan ke bahut kareeb tha lekin satta ke khel main dhire-dhire usne apni patibaddhta maderna se jataa di
 The same group played a decisive role in plotting to get the CD from Bhanwari
 is prakriya main usne paise bhi banaae, sidi or tepe media ko pahunchaae or dhire-dhire maderna or malakhan ko raji karke bhavari ko marava daalaa
 Like any thriller, one character after another added to this story
 sohanlal bishnoi jan swasthya abhiyantriki mahakme main thekedaar tha
 He had good access to the top
 afasaron ko unke manmutabik posting dilava detaa tha
 He made her a sister to get a CD from Bhanwari
 sohanlal ne bhavari ko dene ke naam par maderna se aath lakh ru
 Took it but never gave it to him
 bhavari ne sidi dene ke liye 50 lakh ru
 Asked for cash and after that she agreed to write on a paper that she no longer had a CD
 uske dastakhat kar dene par maderna 10 lakh ru
 Cash and Rs 40 lakhs
 check se dene ko raji hue
 This entire case further revolved around the CD
 is bich malakhan ke logon ne bhavari ke ghar se kuch dividi or sidi hathiyaa leen
 The Malkhan camp leaked a CD of Maderna to the media
 congress ke ek chhutbhaiye netaa sunil gurjar ke jariye yah sidi maderna tak pahunchaai gai
 a plot was also bought for Bhanwari in Ajmer, with the promise that Malkhan would build a house on it
 aisa lagata he ki ek samay par malakhan or maderna donon ne keemat dekar sari sidi hasil karke maamle ko nibataana munasib samajha
 But when he came to know that a CD was being broadcast on all sides, he found that Bhanwari could no longer be trusted
 mumkin he, usne or bhi pratiyaan rakhi hui hon
 At this point, he agreed to Sohanlal's suggestion to eliminate Bhanwari
 sohanlal is maamle main maderna kaa khaas hote hue bhi apane chachere bhai malakhan ke ishaare par kaam kar rahaa tha
 Maderna had hired a local leader and his special Sahiram Bishnoi on his behalf
 indra yahaan bhavari or dusron ke bich sampark sutara kaa kaam kar rahi thi
 These people tried to intimidate Bhanwari through some false kidnapping incidents 
 is par usne police afasar lakhram kii madad se hathiyaaron kaa license banavaa liya
 Maderna had engaged Lakaram's duty to pacify Bhanwari in some way
 lekin ant main sabane yahi nishkarsh nikaala ki blakemeling ke is maamle kaa hal bhavari ko markar hi nikaala ja saktaa he
 Bhanwari's husband persuaded her to travel alone to meet Sohanlal
 usne paisa dene ke vaade ke saath use gaadi main baitha liya
 Bhanwari suspects his intentions and is killed in a moving vehicle
 sahiram bishnoi ne uski laash ko thikaane lagane ke liye ek giroh se sampark kiya
 Bishna Ram and his gang agreed to the task but kept a condition: to help them in cases of fraud against farmers in the Maderna area
 bhavari devi kii laash ko jalaakar uski haddiyon ko besabaal ke balle se kuta diya gaya
 Then all were mixed with mud and thrown into the tributary of Indira Gandhi Canal
 bhavari ke saamaan ko bhi vahiin phenk diya gaya
 The CBI claims that it has recovered assistant nurse Bhanwari's watch from there in its current condition
 usne kuch avshesh bhi baraamad kiye hai lekin abhi yah tay nahin ho paaya he ki ve bhavari ke hi hai
 The CBI is strong about the motive for the murder
 agar sunwaayee ke dauraan sibiai majboot saboot pesh karne main safal ho gai, to maderna or malakhan sahit har us vyakti ko doshi tehraaya ja sakegaa, jis par hatya kii sajeesh kii jaankaree hone kaa aarope he
 The problem is that the circumstantial evidence is very strong, but the CBI does not have direct evidence that Malkhan and Maderna directed the murder
 hatya ko anjaam dene ke aropiyon ko sajaa dilaane main sibiai ko kahin zyada aasaani se safalataa mil sakati he
 Indira Bishnoi and Parasram Bishnoi have emerged as the main conspirators, so Bishna Ram and his associates are more likely to be convicted of erasing evidence
 puri aarope patr main maderna malakhan ke parivaar kii sajeesh ke shikaar ke taur par saamne aate hai
 Even Bhanwari Devi herself was not that eager to take revenge on Maderna
 mana jaataa he ki bhavari ne maderna ke ghar par sirf ek baar, tab bavaal khadaa kiya tha, jab use yah vishwaas dilaa diya gaya tha ki uske tabadale ke peeche maderna kaa haath he
 The CBI charge sheet indicated that it may be a conspiracy by Malkhan's family to first get him transferred and then Malkhan to get him transferred
 lekin iske pehle dosha maderna par madh diya jaae
 Since his CD was already publicized, Maderna knew that if Bhanwari was killed, he would be the first to suspect him
 lekin kanoonee sutron kaa kahana he ki maderna bhi blakemeling se tang aa chuke the
 He was also suspicious of Sohanlal's role in the conspiracy against him
 bhavari kii hatya ho jane se unke saath ke video tepe main bhavari ke hi hone kii satyata kii pushti hona kathin ho jaataa
 The cbi's allegation could be more strong evidence that after Maderna's murder, Sohanlal got Rs 10 lakh through Sahiram Bishnoi
 chukaaye the
 Saheeram's presence at Mahipal's house during the execution of the plot also proves Maderna's role
 sahiram kaa bhavari ko jinda yaa murda lekar aane ke liye kiraye par lenaa bhi sabit karata he ki hatya purv niojit thi
 The allegation shows that all the accused knew about the murder till 2 September
 sibiai ne bhavari devi ke or bhi netaaon or jane-maane logon se sambandh rahe hone kii baat kaa ullekh kiya he, lekin unamem se kisi kaa bhi naam nahin liya gaya he
 In the initial investigation too, more attention was focused on Maderna than Malkhan
 malakhan ke parivaar kii bhoomika kii baariki se jaanch tab shuru hui, jab yah mudda uthaa ki maderna ko fansaane se kise phayda ho saktaa he
 Shambhu Singh Khetasar, who lost the election against Maderna, has also been named after he instigated Amarchand to register a case stating Maderna as the prime suspect
 bachaav paksh yah daleel de saktaa he ki bhavari apni marji se sohanlal ke saath gai thi
 And he was not even kidnapped, that all the people were given supari to pressurize Bhanwari to hand over the entire CD
 or yah bhi ki chalati gaadi se chalaang lagane kii vajah se durghatanavash uski maut ho gai
 The CBI has cited a conspiracy to get Bhanwari killed in a road accident, but has not explained why the conspiracy involving more than a dozen people was abandoned and the conspiracy was difficult to keep a secret
 kya hatyare apane aapako is kadar ajey maanakar chal rahe the ki unhone bhavari jaisi shakhsiyat kii hatya kii sajeesh banane kii himmat kar lee?malakhan or maderna main tulana karen, to aarope patr main maderna ke khilaaf kamjor saboot die gaye hai
 According to the charge sheet, Malkhan was named by Sohanlal as the one who ordered the murder
 maderna ne isse sirf sahmati jataai thi
 Instead of accusing Maderna of conspiring to murder, it may be alleged that he did nothing to stop this conspiracy
 malakhan apni bahan indra or bhai parsaram kii tulana main kam doshi najar aata he
 The CBI has submitted this charge sheet within 90 days of the arrest of Maderna and Malkhan to prevent them from getting bail
 lekin sibiai ko abhi or saboot jutaney kii jarurat he
 He hopes that after arresting Indra, some evidence will be handed over
 duusare, is maamle kaa bhagya is aashay ke thos sabooton par tikaa hua he ki bhavari kii hatya hi hui thi
 The residue extracted from water does not prove this
 sibiai sabhi ko tabhi doshi sabit karvaa paaegi, jab vah ek yaa do aropiyon ko apana gavaah banane main safal hogi
 Be it Pakistan or China, tensions and attacks on both borders have increased
 pehle pakistan kii ore se hi seemaa par tanaav banaaya jaataa tha, lekin ab chini seemaa par bhi kaaphi tanaav rahata he
 In such a situation, the life of our soldiers is always stuck in breath, on which Mulayam Singh Yadav also questioned in Lok Sabha today
 purv raksha mantri or saansad mulaayam singh yadav ne bharat ke khilaaf pakistan or china kii ore se badhate tanaavpurn maahaul ko dekhte hue gahari chintaa jataai he
 He said that our soldiers are very brave and courageous, but are sacrificing their lives
 hamen chaahate hai ki sarkaar asamanjas kii sthiti se baahar nikle or sena ko sahi nirdesh de
 Mulayam Singh, ready to 'return home', will contest from Mainpuri
 The next Lok Sabha election, Mulayam Singh raised the matter related to the soldiers posted on the border in zero time

 However, a new banner has come out with 'atishi Singh' written on it
 ab ise lekar sawaal khadey ho sakate hai

 com / loylv1s7tj— Aam Aadmi Party Delhi (@aapdelhi) October 21, 2018 Has Atishi changed his surname again for political reasons? Let me tell you that in September last month when Aaj Tak reporter asked Atishi that Aam Aadmi Party opposes caste politics but what was the reason that he had to remove his surname 'marlena' just before Lok Sabha elections? Atishi had said, "it is very interesting that in a city like Delhi, there will not be big issues about who eats, what wears, what names are used
" pichley kuch dinon main media ne mere twitor handle or poster par likhe naam ko lekar vistrut charchaa kii he
 "he said," There is an appeal to journalists that if the name is talked about, electoral politics will be focused on the name or caste
 lekin patrakaron ke likhane kii azaadi ko kabhi roka nahin he
 In the same way, we have the freedom to eat or what names are on the Twitter handle
 "mudda naam nahin, kaam hona chahie'ajtak' ne yah sawaal bhi poocha tha ki aapako lagata he ki naam main kuch nahin rakhaa he to upnaam hataane kii zarurat kyon padi? kya aapako dar tha ki aapke sarnem 'marlena' ko lekar bhram failaayaa ja saktaa he? aatishi ne kaha tha, "darasal maine apana paariwarik sarnem kaaphi saal pehle chhod diya tha
 i am using the first name in the election campaign because i think the issue should be work rather than name
 "mata pita ne ditha tha upnaambata den ki purvi dilli se loksabhaa prabharee banaae jane ke baad aatishi ke upnaam 'marlena' ko soshal media ke saath party website, poster or binar se hataa diya gaya tha
 Atishi said that Marlena is not his surname
 yah unke mata-pita dwaara diya gaya upnaam he
 She had also told that her surname is Singh, but she herself decided that she would only use the name Atishi for the election
 aatishi ke nazadiiki logon ke mutabik loksabhaa prabharee banaae jane ke baad purvi dilli main yah afvaah failaani shuru kii gai thi ki aatishi videshi yaa chrischin hai
 According to one of his close friends, Atishi's father's name is Vijay Singh and mother's name is Trupti Wahi
 marlena upnaam unhen unke mata-pita ne hi diya tha
 However, now a new banner has surfaced in which many questions have arisen due to 'atishi Singh' being written

 According to former DUTA president Aditya Narayan, 'during the protest, Satinder Awana used derogatory words against the teachers for making baseless allegations
 awana ne kaha ki ye kanhaiya kumaar ke samarthak he, pakistan ke samarthan ne naare lagaate hai or kashmir kii aazaadee kii baat karte hai
 The matter worsened when Satinder Awana grabbed the collar of a teacher
 duuta adhyaksh nandita narayan ke mutabik, 'jab maine bich bachaav karne kii koshish kii to awana ne kaha ki apni umr dekh, tu naksali he

 Not only this, some of the teachers abused Dusu activists and students and abused us when they said Vande Mataram and Bharat Mata ki Jai
 ' awana ke kaha ki yahaan par chaar aisi chatraayen bhi ai thi jinako hamane jeenyu main desh virdohi naaron ke video main dekha tha yahaan ek aise vyakti ko bhi hamane dekha jo kanhaiya ke saath tha
 He said that there are apprehensions that these people are plotting anti-national incident and want to destabilize DU

 But on Monday, once again, representatives of DUTA reached between the teachers and students agitating in the college, the teachers and the students protested
 bady sankhya main chatraayen,shikshak tathaa shikshak pratinidhi diu kulapati ke karyaalay tak pahunche
 But there was a debate between the student union president and teachers between the slogans of Vande Mataram and Bharat Mata Ki Jai and the matter reached a scuffle
 duuta or enesayuai ne is ghatana ke baad diu prashasan se dusu adhyaksh satinder awana ke khilaaf sakht karwaai karne kii maang kii he

 35 saal ke dhoni ne chauthe number par utarkar na sirf ek chor sambhala, balki 22 gendon main 39 ranon kii pari khelkar srilanka ke liye 181 ranon kaa target choda
 Team India's feat in Cuttack, the most interesting moment of Barabati Stadium in the biggest win in T20s, was when Dhoni hit a brilliant six over deep square leg on the last ball of the innings
 srilankai captain thisara perera kii us gend par chakka lagane ke baad dhoni daudte hue pavilion main daakhil hua
 At that time the entire stadium resonated with 'dhoni-dhoni'
 score card ke liye yahaan clic kareninternational cricket kii baat karen, to dhoni ne apane kariyar main ab tak 24 baar chakka lagaakar pari 'finnish' kii
 Know when and when it happened - 13 times in odis (9 times in target chasing innings) 8 times in T-20 International (3 times in target chasing innings) 3 times in Test cricket (1 time in target In the chasing innings) - Dhoni has hit the last ball of the 20th over of T20 International for the most six times so far

 kal tak sarkaar kii sahyogi rahi tidipi somvaar ko loksabhaa main yah prastaav laa sakati he, shuukravaar ko tidipi ne sarkaar se samarthan waapas lene kaa faisla kiya he
 YSR Congress tried to bring the resolution in the House even today, but it could not be presented due to the uproar
 loksabhaa main tidipi akele yah prastaav nahin laa sakati kyonki is pesh karne ke liye kam ke kam 50 saasandon kaa samarthan jaruri hota he
 The TDP has only 16 mps in the Lok Sabha
 aise main vipakshi dalon ke sahyog ke bina yah praswaav sadan main pesh bhi nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Procedure for bringing the motion: In the day, whichever party wants to move a no-confidence motion, first it has to give written notice to the Chairman
 iske baad sabhapati us dal ke kisi saansad se ise pesh karne ke liye kehete hai
 But it is accepted only when the proposal has the support of at least 50 mps
 sadan is charchaa ho sakati he or phirvoating karaija sakati he yaa samarthan karne vaale saansadon ko khadaa kar unki ginati kii jaati he
 Usually this proposal is brought with the aim of toppling the government when a government comes in a minority
 lekin iskaa istemaal sarkaron ko gherne or chetavanee swaroop bhi kiya jane laga he
 There have been many proposals in the past when the government had sufficient figures and there was no threat to it
 modi sarkaar ke maujuuda aankadon se bhi jaahir he ki use is prastaav se koi khatra nahin he
 The BJP alone is crossing the majority mark (272)
 agar isamen endie ke saajheedaaron ko shaamil kar liya jaae to yah sankhya kaaphi ho jaati he
 The BJP has 274 mps in the Lok Sabha, a party-wise Lok Sabha
 vahiin congress ke 48, ediemke ke 37, tiemasi ke 34, bijedy ke 20, shivasena ke 18, tidipi ke 16, tiares ke 11, sipiem ke 9, wiesar congress ke 9, samaajawaadee party ke 7, inke alaava 25 anya partiyon ke 56 saansad he
 There are 5 seats vacant in the Lok Sabha
 aise main tidipi ke endie se baahar aane ke baad bhi shivasena, algepi (6), apana dal (2), araspi (3) , jediu (2) or akali (4) jaise dalon kaa samarthan sarkaar ko hasil he
 History of no-confidence motion In August 1963, the first time in the history of Parliament was proposed by JB Kripalani
 tatkaaleen pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru kii sarkaar ke khilaaf rakhe gaye is prastaav ke paksh main sirf 62 vot pade or virodh main 347 vot pade the
 Since then, no-confidence motions have been moved more than 26 times
 lekin zyaadaatar prastaav sadan main girte aae hai
 The Morarji government had fallen because of the mistrust motion brought by the first non-congress Prime Minister Morarji Desai's government in 1978
 haalanki desai sarkaar ke khilaaf 2 avishvaas prastaav rakhe gaye the, pehle prastaav se sarkaar ko koi dikkat nahin hui, lekin duusare prastaav ke vakt ghatak dalon ne saath nahin diya tha
 Indira Sarkar's record was the highest no-confidence motion in Parliament's history against the Indira Gandhi government
 unki sarkaar ko aise 15 prastaavon kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 In this sequence, the governments of Lal Bahadur Shastri and Narasimha Rao had faced no-confidence motion 3-3 times
 avishvaas prastaav pesh karne kaa record sipiem ke saansad jyotirmaya basu ke naam he
 He had 4 no-confidence motions against the Indira government

 In fact, the Kamdhenu Cow Sanctuary (century) project in Madhya Pradesh was started with great vigor
 madhya pradesh ke agar malwa main sthit ye desh kii akeli sancturi thi jise besahaara chhod di jane vaali gaayon ke sambhavit samaadhaan ke taur par prachaarit kiya gaya tha
 This century had a capacity to hold 6000 cows
 lekin sancturi ne 4000 gaayon ke baad or gaayon ko aashray dene par haath khadey kar die hai
 This red flag has been shown on behalf of Swami Akhileshwaranand, Chairman of Madhya Pradesh Cow Conservation Board
 bataa den ki swami akhileshwaranand hi wo shaks hai jinhone alag se gaay mantralay banane kii maang kii thi
 The Madhya Pradesh government conferred on Swami Akhileshwarananda the status of a cabinet minister but pulled up when the question of releasing funds for the cow sanctuary came up
 swami akhileshwaranand ne india today ko bataaya, ‘hamane 4000 gaayon ke baad or gaayon ko lenaa band kar diya he
 We do not have resources
 kisaan is sijan me gaayon ko kheton main nahin ghusane dete
 We have information that 10,000 cows are being pushed from Rajasthan border towards Century
 aise main jab pehle se sansadhano kii kami he or gaayon ko anumati di gai to ye aapadaa ko nyotaa dene jaisaa hoga

 'the Congress did not delay in targeting the BJP on this issue
 congress pravaktaa shobhaa ojha ne kaha, ‘sarkaar gaay par raajnneeti karti he lekin jab sahi main unke liye kuch karne kii baat aati he to fund kii kami ronaa royaa jane lagata he
 The government has money to make wildly on advertisements but no funds for cows
 wo gaay ke naam par sirf raajnneeti karte hai lekin asaliyat main inkaa gaay se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 The foundation stone of Kamadhenu Gau Sanctuary was in December 2012 and it was opened in September 2017 for cows
 abhayaarany kaa mukhya uddeshy besahaara gaayon ko vadh se bachaana tha
 Explain that the Central Government had proposed to provide 1000 acres of forest land in each district of 16 states for such sanctuaries, which can support the destitute cows
 lekin hakeekat main jo akeli aisi sancturi astitv main he wo fund kii killat se jujh rahi he

 court ke aadesh ke baad modi ne kaha ki asal main jhooth par aadhaarit koi maamla hamaari kanoonee pranali main tikta nahin he or iske liye main abhaari hum

 In Wardha, Maharashtra on the first date of April, Prime Minister Narendra Modi allegedly tried to take two targets for his party-wise offensive of Hindutva for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 ek, centre sarkaar ke rukh se kuch anmane se ho gaye rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) or vishwa hindu parishad (vihip) kii chunaav main puri madad aashwast kii jaae
 Secondly, through polarization, 54 seats in the Lok Sabha can be cleared, where the Muslim population is more than 20 percent
 bhaajapa netaaon ko ummid he ki agar dhruvikaran kii koshishen safal ho jaati hai to kuch siton ke sambhavit nuksaan kii bharpai ho sakati he
 By the way, it can also become a strong tool for activists of the Narrative Saffron Brigade who were gasping in the government's claims of development and were forced to play on the backfoot due to the ground reality
 modi ne wardha main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke kerala ke vynad se chunaav ladgaye ke faisle par kaha, ''vah (rahul gandhi) aisi siton (vynad) kaa rukh kar rahe hai jahaan par mejority (bahusankhyak hindu), minurity (alpsankhyak) main he, vahaan unhen apni jeet pakki lag rahi he
 "(it is clear that Wayanad has more than 49 percent Hindu population, which the Congress has clarified
 vahaan muslim 28
 8 percent and Christian 21
 5 fisad hai)
 But Modi tried to label Rahul Gandhi and the Congress as being a minority (muslim) preacher
 unhone nerrative pukhta karne ke liye yah bhi kaha, ''vot bank kii politics ke liye congress, rakanpa or unke sahyogi dal kisi bhi had tak ja sakate hai
 The Congress has tried to put Hindu terrorism stain on crores of people of this country
 "yah kadam pradhanmantri kii us sochi-samajhi ranneeti kaa hissaa ho saktaa he jo aresas or sanghathan (bhaajapa) ko holi ke baad (24-25 march) ko mili feedback ke baad taiyaar kii gai he
 According to RSS sources, "the Congress victory in the three states of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan last December was the first bell of danger for the BJP, which showed that there is disappointment for the central government in rural areas and farmers
" balakot ke baad sthiti main sudhaar hua lekin kisaanon kii pareshaani or gramin ilaakon kii samasya bhaajapa ke liye abhi bhi chunauti bani hui he
 "A BJP leader says that surveys of various TV channels and internal surveys of the party are indicating that it is difficult to regain the areas where the BJP performed well in 2014
 khud bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah yah maanate hai ki jin rajyon main 2014 main bhaajapa ne sau fisadi siten jiti thim, usamen kuch kami aa sakati he
 In such a situation, the big question is, where will this damage be replenished? Says a BJP strategist, "the way the leaders of Congress and its allies are making helpful statements for Pakistan and the attempt to describe Hindus as terrorists has taken place during Congress rule, we will take the issue among the people and The Congress or its allies will have to bear the brunt of it
 " makasad he hindu voton ko bantane na diya jaae
 In fact, there are about 60 Lok Sabha seats across the country which are sensitive to polarization
 masalan, jammu-kashmir kii 6 main se paanch siten aisi hai jahaan muslim aabaadi 30 fisadi se adhik he
 The BJP currently has three seats in Udhampur, Jammu and Ladakh
 in siton par muslim aabaadi kramshah 31, 28 or 46 fisadi he
 Then, of the 9 seats in Bihar (more than 20 per cent of the Muslim population), the BJP currently has only 6 seats
 pashchim bengal main loksabhaa kii 17 siten aisi hai, jahaan 20 fisadi se lekar 60 fisadi tak muslim aabaadi he
 The BJP could not win a single one of these 17 seats in 2014
 lekin is baar, bhaajapa mahasachiv, bengal ke prabharee kailash vijayawargeey kaa daawa he, ''bengal main bhaajapa kam se kam 25 siten jeetegi
 Apart from 2 seats in 2014, BJP will also win 23 seats where the Muslim population is fair
 " bengal pradesh bhaajapa ke netaa yah sweekaar karte hai ki piem ke wardha ke bhaashan ke baad bhaajapa ke paksh main maahaul bana he
 Similarly, there are 8 seats in the neighboring state of Assam, where the population of Muslim voters varies from 24 percent to 56 percent
 yahaan bhaajapa ke paas sirf 3 saansad hai
 There are 16 seats in Uttar Pradesh where the Muslim population is more than 20 percent
 in sabhi siton par 2014 main bhaajapa ne jeet hasil kii thi
 There are 4 seats in Maharashtra where Muslim voters constitute more than 20 percent of the population
 bhaajapa or shivasena ne 2014 main in sabhi siton par jeet hasil kii thi
 The strategy of difficult paths, in fact, the move of Hindutva instead of the slogans of development and the central government's plans is because of the difficulty that stands before the Modi government and the BJP
 chhattisgarh main congress ne kisaanon kii karjamaafee or fasalon ke samarthan mulya main badhotaree kaa vaada kiya tha or yah vaada logon tak pahunchaa
 It remained an important issue of discussion in the state before the elections in Chhattisgarh
 bhaajapa yahaan buree tarah se haari
 The defeat made the BJP realize that there is no attraction among the central government schemes among the farmers
 bhaajapa ne yah galati sudhaarney kii koshish kii or 2019-20 ke antarim bajet main do hectare tak kii jot vaale kisaanon ko salanaa 6,000 ru
 Announces cash giveaway

 It was decided to give in the installment of chunaav se pehle kisaanon ko is vaade ke mutabik paisa mil sake, ise aashwast karne ke liye pehali kist disambar 2018 se hi dene kii ghoshnaa kii gai
 But the Congress in its election manifesto gave 20 percent of the poorest people Rs 72,000 annually
 nakad muhaiyaa karaane ke liye nyaay yojana par amal kaa vaada kiya he
 Though the BJP tried to promote it by calling it a daydream and a false promise of the Congress, the discussion started among the people about the scheme
 congress ke media vibhaag ke pramukh randeep singh surajevaala kehete hai, ''bhaajapa ne kaaphi koshish kii ki nyaay yojana charchaa se baahar ho jaae
 For this, he also tried to promote the achievement of scientists in space (A-SAT) as the achievement of the Modi government
 pradhanmantri ne twit karke puure desh ko bataaya ki ve kuch bada elaan karne vaale hai
 "surely Surjewala, the Prime Minister tried to create this atmosphere so that the discussion of 'justice' goes backward", but Modi and Amit Shah could not succeed in their efforts
 "bhaajapa ke waapas hindutv par lautne kii duusari vajah siyaasi ankaganit kaa akalan he
 In states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Maharashtra, where the BJP had a big success in 2014, this time the competition is not easy
 uttar pradesh main sapa-basapa or ralod ke gathjod kii vot hissedari 2014 main bhaajapa ko mili vot share par baari padati dikh rahi he
 The vote share of the rjd-congress-rlsp-hum and the VIP party (mukesh Sahni) in Bihar may not be huge on the NDA (BJP-JD (U) -LJP) but the contest seems to be a thorn
 maharashtra or jharkhand main bhi kamobesh aisa hi he
 Meaning the contest is for 182 seats
 rajd ke pravaktaa or rajyasabha sadsy manoj jha kehete hai, ''modi sarkaar ne agar kisaanon, garibon or yuvaaon ke liye itnaa kuch kiya he to phir hindu voton ke dhruvikaran kii koshish kyon he? modi pichley loksabhaa chunaav main apane har bhaashan main sirf yuva, rojgaar or 'sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas' kaa raag aalaap rahe the
 This time they are talking about minority-majority at the very beginning as they feel that there is no other option but to avoid losing Hindutva
 lekin ve chaahe jo kar len, modi sarkaar ko satta se hatane main mahaj kuch hi din bache hue hai
 "hindutva has 162 seats in the Lok Sabha in Saharashtra West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar
 in rajyon main muslim matadaata acchhee taadaad main hai
 Although excluding ikki-dukki (eg, Kishanganj) seats, Muslim voters are nowhere in a position to win seats on their own
 lekin in rajyon main hindu votaron kaa ek bada tabaka, bhaajapa virdohi dalon kaa kor voter bhi he
 For example, in Bihar, the Yadavs are with the RJD and in Uttar Pradesh, the Yadavs are considered to be the voters of the SP and the Dalit BSP
 aise main dalit, pichhadon or agadi jati main siyaasi rup se vibhajit hindu voter kisi ek dal ke saath tabhi jute sakate hai, jab hindutv ke naam par dhruvikaran hi chunaav kaa sabase pramukh mudda ban jaae
 However, after five years in power, the pair of Modi and Amit Shah have started to feel that there is no edge left only in the achievements of development or government, which can be achieved on the basis of absolute majority
 2014 main modi ke saamne apekshaakrit aasaan sthiti isliye thi kyonki us vakt centre main congress kii aguai main upie sarkaar thi
 Then Modi had a solid target to launch a political attack
 is baar modi khud centre sarkaar ke mukhiya hai or zyaadaatar rajyon main bhaajapa or endie kii sarkaar he
 In such a situation, Modi does not have a strong target to attack this time
 unke paas sirf apni sarkaar kii uplabdhiyaan bataane ke alaava doosraa chaara bachaa nahin he
 But the achievement is not one that can push the opposing parties to the backfoot
 aise main sirf or sirf ek hi taaranhar mudda bachaa he hindutv
 Describing the Congress as anti-hindu and pro-pakistan, the BJP wants to play on the front foot, which has been started by Prime Minister Modi
 lekin sawaal yah he ki kya yah aasaan he?*** On the night of 5 October, politics has intensified over the encounter of a youth at the hands of the police station of Moth police station in the district
 month police ke thanadhyaksh dharmendra singh chouhan par firing kar car luutane ke aarope main erch ke karguvaan gaanv ke nivasee pushpendra yadav kaa encounter kiya gaya tha, lekin mritak ke parijanon ne police kii kahani ko khaarij kar police par hi pushpendra yadav kii hatya kiye jane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 After this, politics also intensified with serious questions being raised on the police
 9 aktubar ko samaajawaadee party ke rashtriya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ne pushpendra yadav ke gaanv pahunchakar parivaar ko santvanaa dene ke baad police par hi pushpendra kii hatya karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Akhilesh said, "what kind of Ramraj is this, where the encounter of innocence is going on?" At the same time, the police are dismissive of all these allegations and are looking into flattery to prove the culprit by exposing Pushpendra Yadav's old crime record
 darasal, 5 oktober ko month thana police ne pushpendra yadav kaa encounter kar diya tha
 According to Jhansi SSP OP Singh, mining businessman Pushpendra Yadav returned from Kanpur on October 5 to attack the police station head Dharmendra Singh Chauhan, who was going to the Moth police station
 isamen goli lagane se dharmendra singh ghayal ho gaye the, jiske baad pushpendra yadav unki creta car lootakar bhaag gaya tha
 According to the police, the attack was carried out because a truck by Pushpendra Yadav was seized by the police
 jhaansi police kaa daawa he ki ravivaar ko postmortem hone ke baad shav ko uske gaanv bhej diya gaya tha
 But the deceased brother Ravindra and family members refused to cremate the body
 shav risive nahin karne ke baad jhaansi police ne gaanv main munaadi karakar shav ke jhaansi muktidhaam main police dwaara antim sanskaar karne kii soochna jari kar di
 After this, the police performed the last rites of Pushpendra
 antim sanskaar hone ke baad yahaan logon main or aakrosh dekha gaya
 The Samajwadi Party has started protests by making it an issue
 akhilesh yadav bole encounter nahin police ne kii hatyasmaajawaadee party ke rashtriya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ne karguvaan gaanv pahunchakar pushpendra yadav ke parivaar ko santvanaa di
 Akhilesh Yadav has said, "this is not an encounter, the police have shot and killed Pushpendra Yadav
" police apane gunahon par pardaa daalane ke liye encounter kii juthi kahani bana rahi he
 "akhilesh Yadav said that this is Gandhi's country
 yahaan yah kaisaa ramraj chalaaya ja rahaa he
 These people who assure Ramraj are destroying the soul of the country
 mritak pushpendra ke parivaar ne police par lagaae gambhir aropamritak pushpendra yadav kii patni shivangi yadav ne trek pakade jane ke evaj main rupayon kii maang ko lekar police ke haathon pushpendra kii hatya kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Sivangi says, "moth police were constantly taking money from her husband
 trek pakadaaey ke baad pati ne police ko ek lakh rupaya diya tha
 Even after this, another demand of 50 thousand rupees was being made
 pushpendra ne rupaya nahin dene kii baat kahkar pehle ke rupye waapas maange to use police ne goli markar maar daalaa
 "the deceased's brother Ravindra Yadav says, the police had evidence of the police officer Dharmendra Singh taking the money
 lene dein par baat bigadgaye par police ko laga ki vah isamen ulajh sakati he to unhone pushpendra ko maar diya
 He also took his mobile which had many proofs
 parivaar kaa kahana he ki thana incharge ke khilaaf hatya kaa cese darj nahin hone tak vah kanoonee ladaai ladenge
 On this matter, Rajya Sabha MP Dr
 chandrapal singh yadav kehete hai, ''police kii puri theory hi sawaalon ke ghere main he
 Pushpendra is not a criminal
 usase lagaataar police paise le rahi thi
 When the matter got worse, his encounter was shown
 pushpendra ke mobile kii kol detail kii jaanch ke baad hi kai chijen saaf ho jaaengin, jis par police pardaa daal rahi he
 "these questions are being raised on the police
 Among the questions that are being raised on the role of the police near the encounter incident, why did the Police Station officer Dharmendra Singh Chauhan come back from Kanpur to meet Pushpendra Yadav before taking charge in the police station? Who to meet him? Called and why did he go there in plain uniform? It was here that there was a dispute between the police station and Pushpendra, after which Dharmendra Singh alleged Received that went drove them shot by pushpendratandon who escaped while injuries to his ear and cheek
 iske baad hi police ne month thane main pushpendra ke khilaaf jaanaleva hamale or creta car luutane kaa mukadmaa darj kiya or kareeb chaar ghante baad hi combing kar pushpedra ko muthbhed main maar giraane kaa daawa kar diya
 After this, he is also surrounded by questions on the delay in post mortem of the dead body
 parivaar ko abhi tak postmortem report nahin dene kaa bhi aarope laga he
 *** raajnneetik gathjod or chunavi mausam 
 Sounds tasteless without slogans
 lekin badalte raajnneetik sameekaran naaron kii bhashaa bhi badal dete hai
 Those who used to shout slogans against each other, now they are together, so think how new slogans of new friendship will be
 ek samay ‘'chadh gundan kii chaati par, muhar lagegi hathi par'' kaa naaraa dene vaali basapa ab sapa ke saath he or 2019 kaa chunaav mil kar lard rahi he
 Obviously, after this alliance, the color of the slogans will also change
 vahiin ‘‘uttar pradesh ko ye saath pasand he'' kaa naaraa dene vaali sapa ko ab congress ‘‘naapsand'' he
 Political analyst Vimal Kishore told "bhasha", "meet Mulayam Kanshi Ram, Hawa Ho Gaye Jayashreeram"
 1993 main jab uttar pradesh main sapa or basapa ne milakar vidhansabha chunaav ladaa tha to bhaajapa ko torget par letaa hua ye naaraa kaaphi charchit rahaa 
 "he said," Now once again the SP-BSP are together but the leadership has changed
 mulaayam kii jagah akhilesh yadav or kanshiram kii jagah mayawati hai
 The SP-BSP has also divided the seats of Uttar Pradesh by forming an alliance for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, so interesting slogans will definitely come out
 '' kishor ne purv ke kuch dilachasp chunavi naaron kii yaad dilaayi 
 The bsp's slogan of "uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections 2007" is not elephant, Ganesh is, brahma-vishnu is Mahesh "
 2014 main bhaajapa ne naaraa diya, ‘‘abaki baar modi sarkaar'' jo party kii vijay kaa kaarak bana 
 The slogan given by the Congress in the 1996 Lok Sabha elections was “jat na na paat ko, seal haath se haath”
 chunavi mausam main naaron ko sangeet main pirokar laudspikar ke sahare aam logon tak pahunchane vaale lok kalakaar ashish tiwari ne kaha, ''is deepak main tel nahin, sarkaar bananaa khel nahin 
 
 
 This slogan was once a counter-attack by the Congress in response to the Jana Sangh's slogan "jali Jhut Bhage Bail, Ye Dekho Deepak Ka Khel"
 ''unhone bataaya ki bhaajapa ne shuruuaati dinon main joardaar naaraa diya tha, ‘‘atal, adwani, camel nishaan, maang rahaa he hindustan''
 Targeting Sonia Gandhi, the BJP gave the slogan in 1999, "fight Ram and Rome
" ''tiwari ne kaha ki ram mandir andolan ke samay bhaajapa or aresas ke naare ‘‘saughandh ram kii khate hai, ham mandir vahiin banaaenge'', ‘‘ye to pehali jhaanki he, kaashi mathura baaki he'' , ‘‘ramalala ham aaenge, mandir vahiin banaaenge'' janabhaawanaaon ke prachand prerak bane
 In response to this slogan, it is said to date
 
 
 ‘‘par taarikh nahin bataaenge 
 "he told that the BJP had given the slogan in 1996," Everybody has seen "bari Bari, Abki Bari Atal Bihari"
 pichley chaar dashakon se raajnneeti par paini najar rakhane vaale varisht patrkaar pradhyumna tiwari ne kaha ki 1989 ke chunaav main ve pi singh ko lekar ‘‘raja nahin fakir he, desh kii takadir he'', diya gaya naaraa unhen satta kii sidhiyaan chadha le gaya
 He said, "remove poverty"
 
 
 1971 main indira gandhi ne yah naaraa diya tha
 During that time she used to say the same sentence at the end of the speech in every election meeting - "he says, Indira Hatao, i say Poverty Poverty, you have to decide
" '' tiwari ne kaha ki basapa ne congress or bhaajapa kii kaat ke liye dilachasp naaraa diya tha, ‘‘chalegaa hathi udegi dhul, naa rahegaa haath, naa rahegaa phool'

 This incident of rape is from Narayani police station area of banda district

 On Thursday she was alone at home

 During this time the girl screamed for help

 But accused Puneet beat him up

 Police say that the accused will be arrested soon
 40 rupye se lekar 200 rupye tak main milane vaale saste, bagaiyr ISI mark vaale helmet pahanakar bike chalaanaa yaa bike par peeche baithna gaiyr kanoonee bhale hi ho lekin iske liye 9 saal main ek baar bhi chaalaan nahin kaata gaya he
 Giving information through RTI, Ulhas PR said that in the last 9 years, the Delhi Traffic Police has not invoiced any biker wearing non-isi helmets
 ghatiya helmet pahanane par koi apni galati maan letaa he to koi dosha madhne ke liye koi or sir talash letaa he
 The fear of the law does not allow the head to remain open, but in such a helmet named the head is not safe because these helmets are cheap but not durable
 ISI marking ke bagaiyr vaale helmet sadak kinare footpath par aapako kahin bhi 40-50 rupye se lekar 100-200 rupye main mil jate hai
 However, the question is when the motor vehicle act states that the helmet must have the ISI mark for the bike
 helmet pahananaa anivaary he to phir in sadakchhaap helmet kii bikri par roak kyon nahin lagati or police iske istemaal par chaalaan kyon nahin katati, yah bhi ek digar sawaal he
 Seeing the cap of Rs
 50, Delhi Traffic Police may get the illusion of a helmet and you will also be saved from a challan of Rs
 100, but believe that such a helmet is no more than Aanchal or Pallu
 ye helmet aapako chot se bachaav kii guarantee nahin detaa lekin police ke chaalaan se jarur bachaa letaa he
 Because of this feature, there is a lot of demand for cheap helmets in the market and when there is demand, there will be supply and production
 dilli get par helmet ke vikreta siddharth chaddha bataate hai ki saste helmet kii bhi khapat he
 Only 50 percent of the people will need a helmet with ISI mark
 baaki to saste kii hi demand karte hai
 We have helmets ranging from Rs 40 to Rs 2000
 tippaniyan Actually, there is no restriction on the production of cheap helmets because the mandate list of Bureau of Indian Standards does not mention helmets
 aise main non-isi yani ghatiya quality ke helmet bananaa kanuunan jurm nahin, bhale hi motor vikal act ise pahanakar bike chalaane kii ijaajat na de
 But let us tell you that if you use a cheap helmet, then you will not get an insurance claim if your head is hurt
 dilli police ke aankadon ke mutabik, 2014 main bina helmet vaale 2 lakh 48 hajaar 357 logon kaa chaalaan hua
 Whereas, till May this year, challans of 2 lakh 68 thousand 585 people were cut
 har maheene ausatan 30 logon kii maut helmet kii vajah se hoti he
 Last year, 1221 two-wheelers were killed in which 247 people died and 1179 were injured
 vahiin 2015 main marane waalon kii taadaad 209 he jabaki 1268 log ghayal hue
 If someone agrees to wear a cheap helmet, then someone seeks another head to blame
 kanoon kaa dar sir ko khulaa to nahin rahane detaa, lekin naam ke aise helmet main sir surakshit bhi nahin rahata kyonki ye helmet saste hote hai par tikaoo nahin
 Without ISI marking, helmets can be found anywhere on the roadside pavement for anywhere from Rs 40-50 to Rs 100-200
 haalanki, sawaal yah he ki jab motor vikal act kahata he ki bike ke liye helmet kaa ISI mark kaa hona jaruri he
 Wearing a helmet is compulsory, so why is there no restriction on the sale of these roadside helmets and why the police do not cut the challan on its use is also a big question
 -50 rupye main milane vaale cap ko dekhakar dilli trephic police ko helmet kaa bhram ho saktaa he or aap 100 rupee ke chaalaan se batch bhi jaaenge, lekin yakeen maniye aisa helmet anchal yaa pallu se zyada nahin
 This helmet does not guarantee you protection from injury, but definitely saves you from police challan
 apni isi khaasiyat kii vajah se bazaar main saste helmet kii khaasi demand he or jab demand hogi to supplai bhi hogi or production bhi hoga
 Siddharth Chadha, the helmet seller at Delhi Gate, says that cheap helmets are also consumed
 50 fisadi hi log honge jinhen ISI mark vaala helmet chahie hota he
 The rest demand only cheap
 hamaare yahaan 40 rupee se lekar 2000 rupee tak kaa helmet he
 The comments darasal saste helmet ke production par koi roak nahin he kyonki beuro of indian standard kii mandetry list main helmet kaa zikr nahin he
 In such a situation, making non-isi helmets of substandard quality is not a legal offense, even if the motor vehicle act does not allow it to ride a bike
 lekin aapako bataa den ki agar aap saste helmet kaa istemaal karte hai to sar main chot aane par insurance clem nahin milegaa
 According to Delhi Police data, 2 lakh 48 thousand 357 people without helmets were challaned in 2014
 jabaki, is saal may tak 2 lakh 68 hajaar 585 logon kaa chaalaan kataa
 Helmets account for an average of 30 deaths each month
 pichley saal 1221 tu vilers kaa accident hua jisamen 247 logon kii maut hui jabaki 1179 log ghayal hue
 At the same time, the number of people who died in 2015 is 209 while 1268 people were injured

 Actually, there is no restriction on the production of cheap helmets because the mandate list of Bureau of Indian Standards does not mention helmets
 aise main non-isi yani ghatiya quality ke helmet bananaa kanuunan jurm nahin, bhale hi motor vikal act ise pahanakar bike chalaane kii ijaajat na de
 But let us tell you that if you use a cheap helmet, then you will not get an insurance claim if your head is hurt

 pradhanmantri narendra modi sansad main raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par charchaa kaa jawaab dete hue jaise hi bolnaa shuru kiya vaise hi vipakshi bench se shorsharaba shuru ho gaya
 After that Modi started speaking
 modi ne kaha, is sadan kii sansadeey parampara bahut hi ucch rahi he
 Very experienced in the House, the senior dignitaries who have been trying to solve the problems of the nation for three-four decades, and who are constantly trying, are also sitting in this House
 mujh jaisaa nayaa vyakti kuch kah rahaa he, sadan kii garima maryaada main kuch kami rah jaae, to nayaa hone ke naate aap mujhe kshamaa karenge
 It is believed
 padhein: rajyasabha main modi kaa puraa bhaashanrashtrapati ji ke abhibhaashan par loksabhaa main 50 se adhik aadarneey sadasyon ne apane vichaar rakhe hai
 i have heard almost all the speeches while in the house and some sitting in my room
 ye baat sahi he ki ye swar aayaa he ki aapane itani sari baaten bataai hai, kaise karoge, kab karoge
 i believe that one has touched the right subject and it is very natural to come to mind
 main ek anubhav bataata hum apana
 Naya Naya went as the Chief Minister in Gujarat
 ek baar sadan main kah diya ki main gujarat ke gaanv-ghar main 24 ghante bijli pahunchaana chahta hum
 The ruling party played applause, there was silence in the opposition
 hamaare vipaksh ke netaa the, choudhary amar singh
 Senior and settled leader of Congress

 How will he speak? unke man main yah vichaar aana swaabhaavik tha
 i was sure, and it happened
 padhein: modi ke bhaashan kii 10 jaandaar bateisaliye varisht mahanubhaavon ke man main vichaar aana swaabhaavik he
 How will it happen if not done yet? magar main sadan ko vishwaas dilaataa hum ki raashtrapati ne jo rasta prastut kiya he, use puraa karne main ham koi kotahi nahin baratenge
 For us, the President's address is not just part of the tradition
 hamaare liye unke madhyam se kahi har baat pavitra bandhan kaa darja rakhti he
 It is our effort to fulfill it and the same thing can also become our inspiration
 isliye raashtrapati ji ke abhibhaashan ko aane vaale samay ke liye, hamane hameshaa ek garima bhi deni chahie, gambhirtha bhi deni chahie
 All of us in the House should try to complete it together
 choti moti nok jhonk jarurijab matdaan hua, tab matdaan hone tak ham sab ummidavaar the, lekin sadan main aane ke baad ham janata ke ummiido ke doot hai
 We are the keepers of public expectations
 kisi kaa kaam use purna karnaa hoga
 If there is any deficiency then the work of some will have to raise a finger on it, so that the work is completed
 choti moti nok jhonk jaruri hoti he
 But i got a completely positive view in the House
 jo mudde uthaae gaye, unamem aashaa thi
 Wherever you are sitting in this Parliament, the hope of the public is echoed in everyone's voice
 ye bharat ke bhagya ke liye ek shubh sanket he
 So Sorry: Modi's school changed the routine of ministers After many years, the country has ensured the journey of development for five years by voting for stable governance, for development, for good governance
 bharat ke matadaataaon kii ye chintaa or unka chintan, ab unhone hamen jo jimmedaari di he, use hamen paripurna karnaa he
 But we have to think about one thing
 ki duniya ke andar bharat ek bada loktantric desh, us rup main to hamaara ullekh hota he
 But is there no time to demand that we are such a great democratized power in front of the world
 hamaari paramparaayen kitni oonchi hai
 There is so much awareness about democracy in the mind of our common man
 kya hamane duniya ke saamne is takat ko sahi rup main prastut kiya he
 After this election it becomes our collective responsibility to influence the world
 puraa europe or america main milakar jitne matadaata hai
 More people are involved in elections
 kya hamane is samarthy ko prakat kiya he
 It is true that in some cases the mentality of slavery of 12 hundred years is affected
 sar ooncha kar baat karne kii himmat kam padati he
 Sometimes the color of the skin also shows the effect
 un sab baton se mukt hokar ab vishwa ke saamne taqatvar rup main prastut hone kaa, aankh se aankh milakar, seenaa tanakar bharat ke 125 karod logon kii takat ko saamne rakhaa jayega
 We will keep his agenda
 is desh kaa garib kisi ke tukdon par palane kii ichha nahin rakhatabhaayiyon bahanon, mananeey adhyaksh mahoday ji, desh, is par sabase pehla adhikaar kiskaa he
 Who should the government be for
 kya sarkaar sirf padhe likhe logon ke liye ho
 Should the government only be for the benefit of these few people
 sarkaar garibon ke liye honi chahie
 Amir has to teach his child, he can hire any school and teacher
 koi biimaar ho gaya to saikadon doctor uske yahaan aakar khadey ho sakate hai
 Where to go poor uske naseeb main to sarkari skool auki aspataal he
 Therefore, it is the first responsibility of the government to listen to the poor and live for the poor
 agar ham sarkaar kaa kaarobaar garibon ke liye nahin chalaate hai
 If we do not run for the benefit of the poor, then the people of this country will never forgive us
 or isliye mananeey adhyaksh mahodaya ji
 This government has first priority
 or ham to dinadayal ji ke aadarshon main paley log hai
 Who spoke about Antyodaya
 gandhi-lohia or dinadayal ji, in teenon mahapurushon ne ek hi rasta dikhaaya ki samaaj ke aakhri chor par baithe vyakti tak sansaadhan or sahaayta pahunchaai jaae
 The poor has to bring that strength, so that it can fight
 garibi ke khilaaf ladaai kaa sabase bada aujaar hota he, shiksha
 Freedom from blind faith
 agar ashiksha se ham baahar laane main safal hote hai, to is desh kaa garib kisi ke tukdon par palane kii ichha nahin rakhata he
 He is ready to create his own world on his own
 ham uski is moolbhoot takat ko pakad bal dene kaa prayaas karen
 If government schemes help in this
 shashan kii sari vyavasthaaen us aakhri chor main baithe vyakti ke kalyaan ke liye hon
 Then the matter will be formed
 suvidha shahar kii ho, aatma gaanv keeham sadiyon se sunate aae hai
 India is a country of farmers and villages
 ye naare sunne main achche lagate hai
 But can we put our hands on the chest and say that we have been able to change their appearance
 ham kisi sarkaar kii aalochana ke liye khadey nahin hue hai
 It is our collective responsibility to make it a priority
 raashtrapati ji ke bhaashan main us baat ko karne kii hamane koshish kii
 Here the subject came up, how will we do it
 suvidha di jaae to gaanv denge vikaas main zyada yogadanjahan suvidha shahar kii ho
 May the soul belong to the village
 gaanv kii pahchaan, gaanv kii aatma main bani hui he
 When a procession comes in the village, the whole village feels that our procession has come
 lekin hamaare gaanv ke logon ko ham aadhunik suvidha se vanchit rakhenge kya
 i say from experience that if the village is given modern facilities, then it will contribute more to the development of the country
 agar gaanv ko 24 ghante bijli, internet conection, schuli padhai mili
 The village may not have the best teacher
 magar ham satellite ke jariye, aadhunik vigyaan ke jariye shahar main baithe zyada kaabil shikshak ke jariye use achche se padhaa sakate hai
 If the youth of the village gets employment then why should they leave the parents
 jo log puch rahe hai, kaise karenge, unako javabgaanv main udyog faile, agro besd industry bane, is takat ko ham sweekaar karen to kisaan kaa gaanv kaa jivan badal saktaa he
 Sikkim small state, sparsely populated, but did important work
 sikkim pradesh kaa har utpaada organic hone vaala he
 Today there is a worrying class of Holistic Health Care all over the world
 ve iske liye daam dene ko taiyaar hai
 The whole country can do what the farmers of Sikkim did
 hamaari chintaa he ki puure north east ko ham organic state ke rup main ubhaaren, vishwa ke bazaar par kabja karne ke liye sarkaar unki madad kare
 So how big a change can come
 hamaari itani krishi uniwarsity hai
 Research is being done
 magar jo lab main he, vah land main nahin he
 it is unfortunate
 hamen aadhunik krishi kii taraf jane kii jarurat he
 In Gujarat, we moved to Swile Health Card
 kisaan ko pataa chalaa ki uski jameen kis fasal ke liye swasth he
 Being made a card showed him that he was growing the wrong crop, used more fertilizer
 jab card ban gaya, to uski laagat bachi or utpaadan badha
 Can it not apply in the whole country
 jo log puch rahe hai kaise karenge
 Telling them hamaare agriculture uniwarsity ke student chuttee main gaanv jate hai
 There are labs in 10 + 2 colleges all over India, it should be made a test lab
 chuttee ke dauraan us lab main swil test karen
 The income earned will benefit both agricultural students and schools
 chote chote prayog karne honge
 What is the railway's habit? mande ko jo maal aae, vah ek hafte tak chalaa janaa chahie
 Manda gets marble, Tuesday is tomato

 Why are we not sensitive? garib ke ghar main shaam kaa chulhaa jalanaa chahiehamaari iti field main pahchaan bani
 But we do not have real time data of Agro Products
 kya ham yah data nahin bana sakate
 We have promised to remove inflation
 ham pramanikta se prayaas ke liye patibaddh hai
 Not because it is just an election promise
 hamaari soch he ki garib ke ghar main shaam kaa chulhaa jalanaa chahie
 Poor's sons will not sleep in the evening with tears
 desh main ann ke bhandar kii kami nahin he
 The system is lacking
 real time data ho
 Let the government know
 jahaan kami ho, vahaan fouran bheja jaae
 Accordingly, become a warehouse
 food karporation of india, saalon se dhaancha chal rahaa he
 If his system is rectified, then i claim that we can change things
 barason se dalhan main research nahin ho rahaa
 People get protein from this only
 agar kuposhan ke khilaaf ladaai ladani he to is par kaam karnaa hoga
 Over the years, we have neither been able to increase production in pulses, nor in its nutrients
 ye ek badi chunauti he
 We should motivate agricultural scientists for this
 'pune or upi kii barbar ghatnaon par kathorta se kaam karenge'bharat ko vikaas yatra main hamaari jo pachaas taka jansankhya he
 We have mothers and sisters, they have to be linked to economic progress
 hamen unki sakriy bhagidaari, unka sammaan or suraksha kii chintaa kerani hogi
 Some incidents have happened in the past
 ham satta main hon na hon
 It is an agonizing event
 chaahe pune kii hatya ho
 Whether Uttar Pradesh is killed
 mandi kii ghatana ho
 Let our sisters be raped
 ye sab ghatnaayen aatmachintan ke liye prerit karti hai
 The government will have to work hard
 desh intjaar nahin karegaa
 Our own soul will not forgive
 main to rajanetaaon se apil karata hum
 Stop psychologically analyzing rape incidents
 hamen shobhaa nahin detaa
 We play with the dignity of our mother and sisters
 kis raajnneetik str par pahunch gaye hai
 What makes us like this type of rhetoric
 kya ham maun nahin rah sakate
 And therefore, respect for women, safety of women, this should be the priority of all our 125 crore countrymen
 china boodha ho rahaa, bharat javanaye desh 65 fisadi jansankhya, 35 se kam aayu kii he
 We are so fortunate
 ham us yug main jivit hai, ham us sansad main baithe hai, jab hindustan duniya kaa sabase noujvaan desh he
 Demographic division, let us recognize this strength
 puri duniya ko skild lebar power kii jarurat he
 China is growing old in our neighborhood, we are becoming young
 ye adwantage he
 Therefore, all countries of the world have the same agenda, skill development
 yahi hamaari bhi praathamikta honi chahie
 We should make it a labor and victory
 'scam india ko skill india bananaa he'hamaari duniya main pahchaan ban gai he, scam india
 We have to build our country's identity, that of Skill India
 or us sapane ko ham puraa karenge
 By creating a separate ministry
 entrprenyorship or skill development banaakar
 We ask here what
 dada dharmadhikari kii kitaab padhi thi bachapan main
 Mahatma lived with Gandhi and Vinoba
 noujvaan naukari lene gaya
 He asked what do you do
 unhone kaha, main graduate hum
 Dada asked, what comes
 usne kaha, main graduate hum
 Dada then asked what is coming
 vah phir bolaa, main graduate hum
 We can feel from this that to survive in life, one must have skill in hand, only degree will not work
 skill development karnaa hoga, uskaa saamaajik states bhi bananaa hoga
 'there is no change in the condition of Muslims' The village child leaves school after seventh due to poverty
 hunar sikhta he
 But the society keeps saying later, well, be seventh
 hamane unke hunar ke kaam ko degree se chhod diya
 Made iti's two-year diploma equivalent to tenth
 aaj hindustan duniya ko maths or science ke teacher de saktaa he
 If the trader goes out then he will bring capital
 shikshak baahar jayega to puri peedi lekar aayega
 Be a Dalit, be a victim, be exploited and deprived
 vanavaasi bhai bahan ho
 i am not saying that there was no seriousness in the earlier government
 magar hakeekat ye he ki unke halaat nahin badale
 Are we ready to come out of the old pattern? mere musalmaan bhai
 When i was younger, i used to see bicycle repairs
 aaj unki teesri peedi bhi vahi kaam kar rahi he
 To change this, we have to have focused activity
 isamen main tushtikaran nahin, badlaav laane ke taur par dekhtaa hum
 Any body, if any part is disabled, the body cannot be healthy
 agar vah durbal rahaa, to samaaj shashakt nahin rah saktaa
 And we are committed to the development of every weaker section
 'gandhi ke aazaadee andolan se len prerana'hamen vikaas kii ek nai paribhaasha kii taraf janaa hoga
 The freedom struggle in the country did not go through a period of 1200 years when there was no fight for the capital
 1857 ke baad puraa desh sangharsh jujhataa rahaa
 The sequence continued
 desh ke liye balidaan kaa silsilaa chalata rahaa
 Andaman's prison was full
 lekin ye mahatma gandhi kaa bahut bada yogadan tha, jise itihaas ko sweekaar karnaa hoga
 It was Gandhiji, who made independence a mass movement, despite the immense number of people desirous of dying for freedom
 koi jhaadu lagaataa tha, koi soot katta tha, koi kisi ko padhaata tha or har koi kahata tha ki main aazaadee ke liye kaam kar rahaa hum
 The British could not understand it
 gandhi ji ne aazaadee ke andolan ko janandolan banaaya
 We learn from them
 prerana len
 We should also make development a mass movement
 ise sarkari kaarykram banaaenge, to vahi hoga jo aazaadee ke liye ladane waalon ke saath pehle hua tha
 'every citizen should understand his responsibility' Everyone in the country should feel that i am doing for my country
 khet main kisaan, kaam karata majdoor, padhaata shikshak, har koi soche, main apane desh ke liye kar rahaa hum
 Even if i don't throw garbage on the way
 samay par naukari par jaataa hum
 So all this is also a service to the country
 ek cricket ke maidan main puraa desh bharat mata kii jai kah khadaa ho saktaa he
 So can also stand for the development of the country
 paanch saal ke baad mahatma gandhi kii jayanti ke 150 saal hone ja rahe hai
 Can we not take this resolution? gandhi ji ko swatchta pasand thi
 We have read the events of Sabarmati Ashram
 kya ham mahatma gandhi ke charnon main 150veen jayanti par saaf sudhare bharat ko rakh sakate hai
 In 2022, 75 years of independence of the country will be completed
 kitne logon ne apni javaani khapa di
 How many people climbed the gallows
 kya aazaadee ke 75 saal ko ek parv kii tarah manaane ke liye agle 5-8 saal prerana ke centre kii tarah rakhen
 i was born after independence
 mere man main vichaar aata he
 i did not get a chance to die for the country
 lekin desh ke liye jeene kaa mauka to mila he
 'mulayam ji get your guidance' if Mulayam Singh ji said that he has run the government, which i want to do

 If you face difficulty then you will get guidance from experienced people like you
 kisi ne kaha ki hamaari nitiyaan nae bottle main puraani sharaab he
 It is natural for them to miss alcohol
 lekin yah bhi kaha ki bhai ye to hamaari baaten hai, aapane jaraa upar neeche karke rakh di hai
 There is nothing new
 iskaa matlab jo ham kah rahe hai wo aapako bhi pataa tha
 Once Duryodhana was asked whether this religion was an understanding of unrighteousness or not
 to usne kaha ki main dharm ko jaanata hum, par meri pravriti nahin
 What is the truth, what is good, i know
 lekin wo mere diene main nahin he
 'take blessings of senior leaders of every party' Mahabharata period is over
 na pandav bache hai, na kaurav bache hai
 But there has always been a sense of victory of the Pandavas in the public mind
 vijay hamen sikhaati he
 We should also learn
 main is sadan ko vishwaas detaa hum
 Whatever seniors we have here, why not belong to any party
 unke aashirwad se ham us takat ko praapt karenge, jo hamen andhkaar se bachaae
 Teach meekness every moment
 kitni bhi sankhya kyon na ho
 We do not proceed without you
 hamen samuhikta kaa bhav apnaanaa he
 These days models are discussed
 gujarat model
 My speeches will be heard
 gujarat kaa model gujarat main bhi ek jile kaa model duusare jile main nahin chalata he
 The country is full of diversities
 agar kuccha ke registan kaa model valsad ke hare bhare ilaake main lagaataa to gujarat kaise tarakkee karata
 'discussion of development model started due to Gujarat' Second model of Gujarat is that we should learn good in any corner of India
 sweekaar karen
 We want to move forward with it in the coming days
 jo acha he, ham sabakaa he, use lekar aage badhenge
 It was spoken on behalf of Tamil Nadu yesterday
 hamaara model gujarat se acha he
 i welcome kam se kam vikaas ke model kii baat or tulana to shuru hui
 Earlier this did not happen
 gujarat model kaa yahi sabase bada yogadan he
 My ears are longing to hear that Gujarat has lagged behind, we have gone ahead
 yahi pratispardhaa he
 Small states are also doing very well
 chhattisgarh, maowad ke saaye main ji rahaa rajya
 What model of PDS did they create? bahan mamata ji, 34 saal kii buraai se rajya ko baahar laane ke liye kitni mehnat kar rahi hai
 Also from Kerala
 vahaan se maine ek junior afasar ko bulaayaa
 We all sat like students, they taught two hours family planning
 nagaland se adhikari aae
 Teached us the nuances of a Tribal Plan there
 yahi chahie
 'allegations in democracy are bad, not criticism' These elder brother's behavior will not work
 ham milakar desh aage badhayenge
 That is why we talked about the organization of cooperatives
 mujhe vishwaas he mananeey adhyaksh mahodaya ji
 Overall i can say that the discussion has been meaningful and in support
 aalochana bhi hui he, to apeksha ke sandarbh main hui he
 i welcome it
 kisi bhi bench or dal se achche suzav mili hai
 i do not criticize them, they ask for guidance
 loktantr main aarope bure hote hai, aalochana to takat detii he
 Today, i had the opportunity to speak in the new house
 kahin koi shabd idhar udhar ho gaya ho
 There has been a lack of rules
 main kshamaa kahana chaahunga
 We were the first candidates to vote
 ab ummiido ke doot or rakhwale hai

 ' Politics has been heated over two starvation deaths in the bjp-ruled state of Jharkhand
 vipaksh is mudde par rajya sarkaar par hallaa bolne main koi kasar nahin chhod rahaa
 At the same time, Chief Minister Raghuvar Das says that both incidents are sad but these deaths have not happened due to hunger
 mukhyamantri ne vipaksh par aarope lagaaya ki logon ko gumraah kar jharkhand kii chhavi kharaab karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 What is the reason behind these deaths in Jharkhand? Is the reason for these deaths being the cancellation of the ration card of the poor, due to which they were deprived of cheap food grains
 ‘aaj tak’ ne sachai kii tah tak jane ke liye jharkhand ke kai ilaakon main saarvajanik vitaran pranali (PDS) kaa reality check kiya
 The team of Aaj Tak tried to find the answers to these questions
 kya alag alag ilaakon main gramin logon ke paas rashan card uplabdh hai yaa nahin? or agar rashan card he to unhen rashan mil rahaa he yaa nahin? saath hi unke rashan card kii aadhaar card se link hone kii kya sthiti he?bataa den ki kai ilaakon se aise aarope saamne aae hai ki jahaan rashan card aadhaar se link nahin he arthath jin graminon ke paas aadhaar card nahin he unhen rashan vikreta rashan dene se manaa kar rahe hai

 yahaan rahane vaale adhiktar log dihadi majdoor hai
 Many of them do not have ration cards
 kuch ke paas card to he lekin beete do maheene se rashan kii dukaan se anaaj nahin mil rahaa he
 According to Pahana Ekka, a young man from the village, he is not getting ration after his mother's death
 rashan vikreta kaa kahana he ki finger print nahin mil rahaa, isliye pehle maa ko lekar aao tabhi rashan milegaa
 Ekka says that in such a situation she does not know what to do
 Can you eat and be full? Shukro, a woman from this village, is pained that there is a ration card but she is not linked to Aadhaar, so she is not getting food grains
 dhanbad main bhi PDS bimaardhanbad main kiye reality check main paaya gaya ki ward number 9 main rahane vaale kuch behad garib parivaar ke logon ko rashan card se rashan nahin mil paa rahaa
 - In a population of 22 thousand people, about 35 poor families came out who do not have a name among the ration card holders
 - kareeb 64 garib parivaar aise hai jinke rashan card to bane hai lekin ye jab bhi rashan vikreta ke paas jate hai to wo rashan cardj ko aadhaar se link karne ke liye kahata he
 Most of them do not know what ration card is linked to Aadhaar

 These include Pink Card (BPL family) 25,528 and Yellow Card (antyodaya family) 4,808
 vahiin safed card kii sankhya 8567 he
 White card holders are considered outside the purview of food security
 is card par khadyann nahin milti sirf kerosine muhaiyaa karaayaa jaataa he
 Some families in Mandu say that despite being in BPL, they have been given the wrong white card, due to which they are not getting ration
 simdega main 2000 rashan card raddasimdega main aadhaar se nahin jud paane kii vajah se 2000 card radd kar die gaye
 Due to this, these families are not getting cheap ration
 sarkaar kii manshaa aadhaar se rashan cardon ko jodakar rashan kii kalabazari rokane kii he lekin rashan card radd hone se aise kai logon ko khaane ke laale pad gaye hai jinhen saste khadyann kii bahut jarurat he
 Reality check was done when the opposition called the government lekin is masale par jharkhand main raajnneetik maahaul bhi garmaaya hua he
 On Monday, all opposition presented a strategy of encircling the government on the issue of starvation deaths
 congress netaa subodhakant sahay ne kaha ki ek maasoom hafte bhar tak bhukh se tadap kar mar gai or sarkaar is par lipapoti karne main lagi he
 According to IVM leader Babu Lal Marandi, the government claims that all schemes are running properly, so why are these deaths due to hunger
 jharia or simdega main dekha gaya he ki log ek ek hafte tak pani pikar rah rahe hai
 Opposition is spoiling the image of Jharkhand: The Chief Minister of Jharkhand Raghuvar Das is dismissing the allegations of the CM opposition
 mukhyamantri ke mutabik vipaksh jharkhand kii chhavi kharaab karne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Describing the events of both the deaths as tragic, the Chief Minister said that the Deputy Commissioner was sent to the spot for investigation

 (agency se input) The series of tweets and statements about Ram Manohar Lohia's birth anniversary is not taking the name of threat
 piem modi ne bhi lohia kii janyati shanivaar ko twit kar mahagathbandhan ke netaaon ko aade haath liya
 At the same time, RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari also spoke on the occasion
 unhone is babat ek fasebuk post bhi likhaa
 He wrote that if Lohia had been there today, he would have been uniting opposition parties to oust Prime Minister Narendra Modi from power
 shivanand tiwari ne apane post main likhaa ki lohia maanate the desh kii raajnneeti par kangresi ekadhikaar kii vajah se loktantr khatare main he
 To save democracy, he started a campaign of non-congressism
 gaiyr kangresavad unki ranneeti thi
 He had a special reference
 jansangh ke pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay or communist party ke kamred bhupesh gupt unke gaiyr-congresavad kii ranneeti ke sakriy sahyogi the
 In the context of that then it was a successful strategy
 us ranneeti kaa parinaam tha ki azaadi ke baad pehali martabaa aadha darjan se zyada rajyon main gaiyr-congressi sarkarein baniin
 Congress's notion of invincibility broken
 shivanand ne aage likhaa ki jaisaa ki naam se hi spasht he, kisi bhi ranneeti kaa makasad taatkaalik hota he
 In contrast, policy is either permanent or long-term
 lohia agar aaj hote or aaj bhi gaiyr-congressiwad kaa naaraa de rahe hote to log unka uphaas udaate
 Today's condition of Congress in country's politics can only be called pathetic
 loksabhaa main to aaj use virdohi dal kii manyata bhi praapt nahin he
 According to Shivanand Tiwari, a man with little understanding of Lohia's ideas and policies, it can easily infer that if he had been there today, he would have been restless towards mobilizing the entire opposition to overthrow Narendra Modi's government
 loktantr or samvidhan aaj khatare main he
 Fundamentalism has strengthened in the last five years
 modi sarkaar kii kattarwadi nitiyon kii vajah se desh kii seemaa par ghor ashaanti he
 Whether it is Kashmir from Pakistan or North East states with China
 aisi sarkaar jo desh kii simaaon par rahane vaale apane nagarikon ke man main apni nitiyon kii vajah se bhay or shankaa paidaa karti he usko laayak sarkaar nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 If Lohia had been there today, he would have said that the eviction of such inferior government from power is the political religion of today
 pandit nehru ke sherwani or chust pajame vaali poshaak ke vishay main lohia kehete the ki mogul darbar ke tabalchi aisa poshaak pahante the
 What would Lohia say about Narendra Modi's finery? The manner in which intolerance has increased under Modi raj is terrible
 modi ke viruddh bolne main khatara he
 Looking at the way the media is today, how can it be said that we are a democratic country! For the purpose of establishing a healthy democracy in the country, Lohia had devised a strategy of non-congress debate to remove the Congress from power
 lohia aaj hote to modi sarkaar kii dharmik kattarwadi nitiyon se loktantr ko bachaane ke liye desh kii satta se modi sarkaar chyut karne ke makasad se sadak se sansad tak kii niti banane kii disha main bechaini ke saath sakriy hote
 Lohia's politics was fierce
 ,akramakata thi
 Had Lohia been today, he would have been lodged in a jail after eating sticks with his colleagues against the policies of the Modi government
 narendra modi ji kair manaaen ki aaj lohia yaa lohia jaisaa koi nahin hai
 Otherwise, this autocratic rule of five years would have been shaken by now

 a Pakistani lawyer is fighting a legal battle in the Lahore High Court to prove him innocent after 86 years of hanging
 vakil imtiyaaj raashid kuraishi ne arji dekar yachika par jald sunwaayee kaa aagrah kiya
 The Lahore High Court bench had in February urged the Chief Justice to constitute a larger bench for hearing the petition filed by Qureshi, but no action has been taken so far
 bataa den ki kuraishi lahore main bhagat singh memorial foundation chalaate hai
 What was in the petition? In the petition, Qureshi had said that Bhagat Singh was a freedom fighter
 jinhone avibhajit hindustan kii aazaadee ke liye sangharsh kiya tha
 Many Pakistanis, especially those living in the Punjabi-speaking Lahore region, consider Bhagat Singh a hero
 bhagat singh kaa aaj bhi sammanunhone kaha ki bhagat singh kaa aaj bhi bhartiya up mahadweep main na keval sikhon balki musalamaanon dwaara bhi sammaan kiya jaataa he
 Even the founder of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, paid tribute to him twice
 unhone kaha, 'yah rashtriya mahatv kaa vishay he
 'the petition has demanded the court to abrogate the sentence of Bhagat Singh following the principles of reconsideration and order the government to give him state honors
 is kaaran chadhaaya faansee parbhagat singh ko 23 saal kii umr main british shaskaon ne 23 march 1931 ko faansee par chadha diya tha

 is silsile main bhagat singh , sukhdev or raajaguru par british police adhikari jon pi sanders kii kathith taur par hatya karne ke liye yah maamla darj kiya gaya tha
 Qureshi said, "I have filed a petition in the Lahore High Court for an early hearing on the Bhagat Singh case
" maine register se aagrah kiya ki maamle kii sunwaayee kii taarikh tay karen or ummid he ki is maheene maamle par sunwaayee hogi
 He said that a letter to the federal government has been demanded to install the statue of Bhagat Singh at Shadman Chowk (the main part of Lahore) where he was hanged along with two of his associates

 In Rajkot, India had scored 316 runs chasing a mammoth target of 326 runs
 vah match kai lihaaj se ahm tha
 Staying so close to victory while chasing a big goal indicates a bad time
 ab jabaki kharmaas biit chukaa he, bharat ke saamne nai chunautiyaan hai
 He has to take care of himself before the home Test series with Australia and for that he will have to win over the English team
 captain mahendra singh dhoni ko un galatiyon se bachanaa hoga, jo unhone rajkot main kii thi
 The absence of Cheteshwar Pujara, who was playing in great form, in the playing XI had caused criticism for Dhoni
 dhoni rabindra jadeja ke sthaan par pujaara ko team main shaamil kar sakate the lekin beete match main pakistan ke khilaaf harfanmaulaa pradarshan karne vaale jadeja ko captain kaa bharosa mila or is tarah bharat ko ek achche farm main chal rahe ballebaaj ke bina hi maidan main utarana padaa
 This time is bad for Dhoni
 ek samay tha, jab vah jis cheez ko choote the, sona ho jaataa tha lekin aaj halaat badal chuke hai
 There was a time when Dhoni's wrong decisions were also proved correct, but today many of his right decisions are also proved wrong
 aise main dhoni ko jaanboojhkar koi jid yaa galati se bachate hue apane saathiyon ko acha khilne ke liye prerit karnaa chahie
 This is more important for the team because without Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, the team is seen to be weak anyway
 or to or salaami ballebaaj beete saal se lekar ab tak ek maukey par bhi acchhee shuruyaat nahin de sake hai
 The team lacks balance of performance
 yahi kaaran he jab gendbaaj acha karte hai to ballebaaj flop ho jate hai or jab ballebaaj chamakate hai to gendbaaj kaam kharaab kar dete hai
 In Rajkot, three England batsmen had scored more than 100 runs and four batsmen of India were able to make more than this average but despite this the team lost
 kaaran saaf he, bhartiya ballebaajon ko kuch or der tak wicket par tike rahanaa hoga
 It is the same for bowlers
 ishanth sharma ne pakistan ke khilaaf tisare mukaable main dilli main shandaar gendbaaji kii thi lekin rajkot main unke 10 over ke cote main 86 ran bane
 Being a strike bowler, Ishant has to be consistent in his performance
 duusari ore, english team ke saamne bharat se kaaphi kam chintaaen hai
 His batsmen are in good rhythm and the bowlers are doing their job well
 ekadivasiy shrinkhalaa se pehle do abhyaas match haarane ke baavjood english team ne uskaa asar apane pradarshan par nahin aane diya
 Trying Ian Bell as an opener by captain Alastair Cook has led to new energy communication for the team
 do abhyaas maichon se lekar ab tak bel ek shatak or do ardhashatak laga chuke hai
 He has good and in-form batsmen in the form of Eoin Morgan, Craig Keyswetter and Kevin Pietersen, who have the ability to score at a very fast pace
 in sabane rajkot main ise sabit bhi kiya he
 It is difficult to say what the Kochi pitch will do but it is so sure that the English team is looking to equalize the 5-0, 5-0 defeat in the last two series in India and it is very difficult to stop them in these conditions of India
 Will be difficult

 Significantly, the accused in the Malegaon bomb blast case and BJP candidate from Bhopal Lok Sabha seat, Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, accused the police officer Hemant Karkare, who was martyred in the Mumbai terror attack
 pragna ne mumbai aties ke divangat pramukh kaa naam lete hue kaha, ‘itani yatnaaen deen, itani gandi gaaliyaan deen jo asahneeya thi, mere liye or mere liye nahin, kisi ke liye bhi

 "so canned food has become not only unsafe but also dangerous enough to cause diabetes and high blood pressure in children? Actually, the answer to this question is present in the latest food report of the Center for Science and Environment (CSE)

 Michael Jansen, assistant professor at the University of North Carolina, states, "contrary to the common belief that smartphones and social media are negatively impacting young people's mental health, we are not seeing much support for the idea that phones and online Time spent is associated with increased risk of mental health problems

 doston se baat karne ke liye phone kaa istemaal karnaa acha he, lekin chaatro ko saamne se milakar doston se baat karne ko bhi mahatv dena chahie
 "he adds," Social media can be used to express ideas with positivity
 iske saath hi soshal media se prabhavi dhang se nipatane ke liye bacchon ko kuch skills kii jaankaree hona chahie
 "the elders should help them give a better shape to the overall lifestyle of children by becoming a better role model

 The furore has been intensifying with the recommendation of disqualifying 20 mlas of Delhi's ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)
 rashtriya rajdhani kii raajnneeti main aarope-pratyarope isliye tej ho gaye hai, kyonki agar raashtrapati ramnath kovind ne AAP ke 20 vidhayakon ko ayogy ghoshit kiya, to jaahir taur par sattar siton vaali dilli vidhansabha main 20 siton par chunaav phir se honge
 While the AAP is deeply concerned about the elections in these 20 seats, on the other hand there is a wave of happiness in the BJP and the Congress
 donon vipakshi dalon ne in 20 vidhansabha siton par chunaav ke liye taiyaariyaan shuru kar di he
 In fact, the written test of disqualification of 20 mlas of the Aam Aadmi Party can be reached anytime
 dilli main dobaaraa chunaav ko lekar AAP chintishgar raashtrapati ne chunaav ayog kii sifarish maani, to dilli kii 70 vidhansabha siton main 20 par chunaav shuru ho jaaenge
 The worry of re-election can be clearly seen on the forehead of Aam Aadmi Party
 AAP ke 20 vidhayakon ke ayogy ghoshit hone kii sifarish ke baad machaa sangram shuukravaar shaam tak shant ho gaya tha, lekin AAP ke nae navele saansad sanjay singh ne is sangram kii shuruyaat subah-subah phir kar di
 Who should explain to Sanjay Singh that counting one's sins does not reduce his sins
 vipakshiyon kii nazar main dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal samet puri party sandigdh hai
 So the question is bound to arise
 AAP par tanj kasate hue vipakshi kah rahe hai ki chuppi todie kejariwal ji
 In preparation for the Congress elections, not only the BJP, but the Congress Legislative Assembly which has ruled Delhi for a long time is zero
 lihaaja uskaa aakrosh zyada shaktishaalee he
 But the BJP is being targeted by the Aam Aadmi Party, but the Congress is being attacked
 AAP ke 20 vidhayakon ko ayogy tehraane kii chunaav ayog kii sifarish kii khabaron se utsahit dilli congress ne sambhddha vidhansabha kshetron main sambhavit up-chunaavon ke liye yojana banani shuru kar di he

 isamen party padaadhikariyon ne ubharate paridrishy or 20 vidhansabha kshetron main sambhavit chunaavon ke bare main charchaa kii
 a senior party leader who attended the meeting said that during the entire meeting, discussions centered on the recommendation of disqualifying 20 AAP mlas
 is dauraan aane vaale dinon main sabhi 20 vidhansabha kshetron main sammelan karne kaa faisla kiya gaya
 Aam Aadmi Party has received a setback from the Election Commission and High Court
 ab somvaar ko dobaaraa sunwaayee he
 But the hope of relief is slim
 20 vidhayakon ke ayogy ho jane se dilli kii sarkaar par to koi khatra nahin he, kyonki use dilli vidhansabha main baari bahumat hasil he
 But it is definitely that if the mlas are disqualified, then 20 seats will be re-elected and it is obvious that for BJP and Congress, these elections will be like Sanjeevani
 dilli vidhansabha main AAP vidhayakon kii sankhya ghatakar rah jaaegi 4620 vidhayakon ko ayogy tehraae jane se dilli vidhansabha main AAP ke vidhayakon kii sankhya ghatakar 46 ho jaaegi
 When the Election Commission recommended the President to disqualify the 20 AAP mlas, the BJP immediately questioned whether the AAP government now had any 'moral right' to remain in power? BJP and Congress attacked Kejriwal Chairman Manoj Tiwari said that the party's Delhi unit is ready for elections at any moment
 unhone kaha, ''ham AAP ke 20 vidhayakon ko ayogy ghoshit karne kii sifarish kaa swaagat karte hai
 Arvind Kejriwal should resign from the post of Chief Minister taking responsibility for this moral defeat
 '' udhar, pradesh congress adhyaksh ajay maakan ne kaha ki ab mukhyamantri aravind kejariwal ko satta main rahane kaa koi adhikaar nahin he
 Hanging on these AAP mlas, the post of Talawalabh, 20 AAP mlas who came under the scanner include Kailash Gehlot, a party MLA from Najafgarh and a minister in the Kejriwal government
