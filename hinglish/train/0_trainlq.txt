 aise main bihar main holi ke ek chalan ne apana hi rang jamaa liya he
 This is the practice of 'kurta Phad Holi'
 mjedaar ye he ki holi kii yah parampara mardo tak hi simit nahin he or na hi yah kisi khaas varg kii parampara he
 Holi has its own tradition of singing in Bihar and it continues to divide according to class and region
 holi geeton ke gayan se kshetra vishesh ke logon ke bich paramparaon kii jaankaree mil jaati he
 In the morning there used to be a game of kado (mud) in the Holisubah of mud
 isamen keechad ke saath gobar kaa mishran banaaya jaataa tha, jisase holi kheli jaati thi
 This Holi was practiced from 10 to 11 am
 isi kram main kapade sharir se alag kiye jate the, taaki keechad se puraa sharir ranga hua najar aae
 People divided into two groups tried it on each other
 iske baad samay shuru hota tha rang kaa
 It was very important to paint teeth
 rangane vaala ko vijeta or jisko ranga gaya vah parajeet mana jaataa tha 
 Then the round of abuses started
 samavet gayan main gaaliyaan gaai jaati thim
 The phase of colors used to end after two o'clock in the afternoon and then the singing of Gulal and Holi began
 badalte samay main gayan khatm ho gaya he par kurta faad holi jinda he, kyonki lalu prasad ke samay main is parampara ko kaaphi tool mila or prachaar bhi
 Today it is in its youth and everyone tries it
 patna ke 65 varshiya bujurg vrujanandan prasad ne kaha ki agar saral shabdon main kahen to diwali hamaare ghar kii safai kaparv he to holihamaare man kii safai kaa parv he
 He said that the actual beginning of Holi starts at the beginning of Phalgun month
 holi ke ek din purv holikaa dahan ke dauraan aasapaas ke kooday kaa ant ho jaataa he to varsh kaa prarambh hota he rang or gulaal kii dhamachaukadi se

 paris ko aatanki hamalon se dahalane vaale chaar chehron main se teen to ab is duniya main nahin rahe
 But the only surviving female terrorist of this module still remains a scam for the Elite Police Force of France
 charlie abdo ke 'gunahagaar' hue dherkahane kaa matlab ye ki france kii police ko agar is vakt kisi insaan kii sabase zyada talash he, to wo he ek 26 saal kii ladki, jiskaa naam hayaat boumedini he
 Boumedini, the beautiful bull that has the head of the murder of the four innocent innocents of the super market, as well as the complicity of being involved in terrorist acts and who, despite being on the police radar for years, has managed to deceive the police every time She goes
 jaaniye hayaat boumedini ke bare menjehad ke naam par hathiyaar uthaanewaali hayaat kii ek duusari tasviir saamne ai he
 Hyatt, who lives in a two-piece bikini with her boyfriend and live-in partner, Amédée Coulibelli, is the biggest and alive criminal of the latest terrorist attacks in Paris
 bahut se logon ke liye ye yakeen karnaa bhi mushkil ho saktaa he ki jis jehani kattarpan kii badaulat ye ladki begunaahon kii jaan lene se bhi gurej nahin karti, vahiin mauka milane par aisi aisho-aaraam kii jindagi bhi khul kar jiti he
 But it says that the pictures never lie
 france police kii maane to hayaat boumedini abhi nahin, balki kai saalon se amedi colibeli ke saath rah rahi thi or amedi kii tarah uskaa itihaas bhi daagdar rahaa
 In 2010, he met Amdi Coulibelli, who was jailed for ten years in a dacoity charge, and since then the two have become friends with each other
 udhar, jail main hi super market ke gunahagaar amedi kii mulaakaat aatankwaadi harkaton main shaamil rahe kouchi bandhuon main se ek sharif kouchi ke saath hui
 Here Amédée was influenced by Cauchy and then changed his religion
 france police kii maane to kouchi bandhuon ne hi amedi or uski garlfrand hayaat kii mulaakaat france ke murat naam ke kasbe main rahanevaale ek kattar dharmik netaa jamail beghaal se karwaai thi or iske baad beghaal ne apane ghar par chaaron kaa brinwash kiya
 The fact is that at this time, the name of the most wanted for the French police, Hyatt Boumedini, has not come before the police for the first time, but before that in 2010, the French police questioned him once in connection with terrorist acts
 lekin isse pehle ki uske khilaaf koi sakht karrwai hoti, wo police ko chakma dekar aatankwaadi harkaton main shaamil hoti rahi, or to or usne apane bwoyfrand ke saath murat main apane aalaa kaman beghaal ke ghar par hi hathiyaar chalaane kii training bhi hasil kii
 On the other hand, the track record of Hyatt's Boyfrand Amédée is also not good
 wo apni nau bahanon kaa iklauta bhai tha
 But instead of helping the family, he remained involved in the world of crime from the beginning
 pehle usne lut or dakaiti kii kai vaardaaton ko anjaam diya or phir dhire-dhire drug deling bhi karne laga
 He was convicted in these crimes and he remained in jail for a long time
 lekin jail kii salakhen bhi use sudhaar nahin saki or baahar nikal kar wo tathakthith jihadi harkaton main shaamil ho gaya
 After wreaking havoc in the super market, the police punished Amedi for his crimes
 lekin uski garlfrand or bikni se burke tak kaa safar tay karanevaali amedi ab bhi france police ke liye ek paheli bani he
 Although three of these four faces that have rocked the world as well as France in the last three days have now piled up, but Hyatt still remains a headache for the police
 police kii maane to colibeli ne jab guuruuvaar ko do pulisavaalon ko apana nishaanaa banaaya tha, tab hayaat bhi uske saath thi or uske duusare din supermarket main bhi usne begunaahon kii jaan lee
 But before the police catch her, she manages to escape by dodging and in such a situation the police suspect that she can now go to any extent to avenge her companions
 lihaaja, france kii police ne uske naam most vanted samet armd and dangers ke tag ke saath nae sire se poster jari kar die hai

 The Shiv Sena said that it is surprised that when the Ram temple will not be built in Ayodhya during the tenure of the current bjp-led government

 Shiv Sena said through the party mouthpiece Saamana, "he (modi) came to power in the name of Ram, though according to him, Lord Ram is not older than the law
 ab sawaal yah he ki agar bahumat vaali sarkaar main mandir kaa nirmaan nahin hoga to kab banegaa

 Such that even Parinda could not kill
 lekin is dauraan gali-mohalle ke apradhi khuleam ghoomte rahe
 The Delhi Police figures are saying this
 1-15 janvari tak kaa krime grapsdhikariyon ne bataaya ki zyaadaatar pulicekarmi lutiuns dilli main tainaat the
 From 1 to 15 January, 427 cases of theft and snatching were registered in Delhi
 jabaki 1 se 15 disambar ke bich aise maamalon kii sankhya 394 thi
 That is, in a month, such crimes increased by 92 percent
 vahiin 2015 main 1 janvari se 15 janvari tak aise 348 maamle darj kiye gaye the
 There is a similar difference in theft of vehicles and houses

 Therefore, in Thane, except Lutyens Delhi, every police station had to operate with 40 percent staff
 mal or bade bazaaron main baari sankhya main police bal tainaat kiya gaya tha, baavjood iske un jagahon par local apradhi apni karatuuton ko anjaam dene main kaamyaab rahe
 This was the strategy
 a senior Delhi Police official said that the strategy was to deploy the soldiers in such a way that khaki is seen everywhere in the capital's malls, roads and markets
 yah ranneeti isliye apanaai gai taaki aatanki or unka saath dene vaale apradhi khauf main rahen
 Investigating Officer a senior police officer said that while cases are being registered, their investigation is becoming difficult
 kyonki jaanch adhikari bahut kam hai

 At the same time, the state government's authority has been stated on the circle rate of electricity and land
 ab aadmi party ne dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dilaane ke mudde ko lekar janata ke bich jane kii ranneeti banaai he
 Through this, where she will be able to put pressure on the Center, in the coming Lok Sabha elections, Delhi will put the money to cash in on this issue
 aam aadmi party ke dilli pradesh sanyojak evam cabinet mantri gopal raay ne kaha ki pichley chaar saal se centre sarkaar dilli kii janata ke saath anyaay kar rahi he
 Obstacles are being put to all the work of the Delhi government
 iske samaadhaan ke liye hamane harsambhav prayaas kiye parantu koi sakaaratmak parinaam nahin aae
 After the formation of our government, in May 2015, the Union Home Ministry tried to take away the powers of the Delhi government by issuing notifications
 is sandarbh main hamane centre ke samaksh bhi apana paksh rakhaa or dilli ke up rajyapal ke samaksh bhi apana paksh rakhaa parantu kahin se koi samaadhaan nahin niklaa
 Finally, we were forced to knock the doors of the judiciary
 gopal raay ne kaha ki hamane hai court main is sandarbh main apana paksh rakhaa or uske baad supreme court main bhi apana paksh rakhaa
 The date was found at both the places, but the people of Delhi did not get justice
 loktantr main sabase badi adaalat janata kii adaalat hoti he
 The party has decided that on this issue we will now go among the people of Delhi and start a movement on a large scale
 gopal raay ne kaha he ki dilli ke logon ko kai samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 The major problems are -1
 dilli vaasiyon ke vot kii keemat desh ke anya bhaago se aadhi kyon?2
 The hardworking people of Delhi give a tax of 1
25 lakh crores to the center, why does Delhi get back only 325 crores? 3
 dilli ke collejon main kyon nahin hota dilli se 12veen paas karne vaale chaatro kaa daakhila? kahaan jaaen dilli ke chaatr?4
 Why are young people wandering in Delhi for jobs? Who will answer millions of vacant posts? 5
 dilli waalon kii suraksha kiske jimme he? dilli police he kiske prati javabdeh?6
 Why can't the elected government of Delhi take decisions in the public interest? How do the transfer posting of viceroy-lg Sahab officers-employees imposed since the British era? 7
 dilli ke logon kii jameen par dilli ke logon ke liye skool aspataal banane ke liye centre sarkaar se kyon gidgidaana padataa hai
 8
 dilli main bhrashtachar rokane vaali ACB ko centre sarkaar ne kyon chhina

 dilli kii saaton loksabhaa siton par bhaajapa ke pratyaashiyon ko jitakar loksabhaa main bheja tha, parantu bhaajapa ne dilli kii janata ke saath phir bhi sautela vyavhaar kiya
 We hoped that perhaps the court would bring some relief to the people of Delhi, but there was no solution from there either
 antat party ne tay kiya he ki dilli main ek andolan kiya jayega
 He said that in order to win the Aam Aadmi Party candidates on the seven Lok Sabha seats of Delhi, to form a coalition government in the country and to give full state status to Delhi, the party will go among the people of Delhi and will make a wide-ranging movement
 
 party ne tay kiya he ki 23 farvari ko apane sabhi vidhayakon ke saath andolan ko lekar ranneeti banaaegi
 Implementation of these strategies will be discussed by meeting with 1000 office bearers of Delhi on 24 February

 maahi, captain kool or emesadi jaise naamon se pahachaane jane vaale mahendra singh dhoni ne test se rest lene kaa faisla kar liya he
 While all the former players and cricket experts are saying Dhoni's decision right, some people like former cricketer Atul Vasan are also pointing fingers at him due to his retirement in the middle series
 dhoni ke captaini ke saath hi test cricket ko bhi adwida kehane par bahut se log aashcharya chakit hai
 Those who questioned Dhoni's captaincy and position as a player in his Test team till yesterday, are also now bridging his praise
 kai log aise bhi hai jo dhoni ke sanyas se khush ho sakate hai yaa yun kahen bahut zyada khush honge
 It can be said that Dhoni said goodbye to Test cricket, he was sad, and also happy, that is, Total Cocktail
 khel ke jaankaron or purv khilaadiyon ko aashcharya hua to unke prashansakon ko ab safed jersey main dhoni ko nahin dekh paane kaa dukh rahegaa
 But there is also a group which can be happy with the retirement of Captain Cool
 yah wo jamaat he jo 2 disambar 2005 ko dhoni ke test team main aane yaa yun kahen 23 disambar 2004 main dhoni ke antarrashtriya cricket kariyar kii shuruyaat se hi haashie par chali gai thi
 Players like Dinesh Karthik, Wriddhiman Saha, Parthiv Patel, Ambati Rayudu, CM Gautham, Uday Kaul, Puneet Bisht, Naman Ojha, Aditya Tare and Robin Uthappa are the pioneers in this group that can express happiness with Dhoni's retirement
 haalanki ambati rayudu or robin uthppa part time wicketiper hai or ve ek ballebaaj ke taur par team main jagah banaate rahe hai
 But the rest of the wicketkeeper-batsmen can now think of making a place in Team India
 maujuuda daure ke antim test match main dhoni kii gairmaujuudagi main riddhimaan saaha wicketiper kii bhoomika nibhaayenge
 Needless to say 9 years have passed since 2005, but for these wicketkeeper batsmen, a better time would never have come before this
 kai baar baton-baton main log hamase puch lete the ki dinesh karthik jaise khilaadiyon ko team main aane ke liye kya karnaa chahie
 So the answer was that they cannot do anything, because they have to replace captain Dhoni, not wicketkeeper Dhoni and it is almost impossible
 lekin ab in sabake liye achche din aa gaye hai
 For the first time in 9 years, Team India has vacated the place of wicketkeeper
 ab khulaa manch he or in khilaadiyon ke paas sunaharaa mauka bhi, team india main apni jagah pakki karne kaa
 Take a look at the first class record of some wicketkeeper-batsmen present in the country ready to replace Dhoni

 Also 2 in February 2015 to Dean Philpula

 It is said that 75,000 diamonds have been found so far from this area of america
 pehali baar 1906 main yahaan se hira mila tha
 In 1906, a man named John Huddlestone found two glowing crystals at this place
 donon crystal kii jaanch karwaai gai to pataa chalaa ki ye keemtee hira hai
 After this the place was named The Crater of Diamond
 iske baad jon ne apni 243 acre jameen diamond company ko oonchi keemat par bech diya
 In 1972, this land came into the National Park
 1906 se hi is jameen ko diamond utpaadan kshetra banane kii koshishen kii jaati raheen, lekin ise aam logon ke liye khol diya gaya
 a 14-year-old youth, Kaleel Landford, was 7 in March this year, CNN reported
 44 carat ko hira mila tha
 Even more surprising is that to get such a big diamond, the young man had to work for only 30 minutes or half an hour
 kalel ne bataaya ki vah yahaan se guzar rahaa tha tabhi uski najar bhure rang ke ek pathar par padi, lekin paas jaakar dekha to laga koi khaas cheez he

 bataaya jaataa he ki america ke is ilaake se ab tak 75, 000 heere mil chuke hai
 The diamond was first found here in 1906
 1906 main jon hadlestone naamak aadmi ko isi jagah do chamakate hue crystal mili
 When both the crystals were examined, it was found that they are precious diamonds
 iske baad is jagah kaa naam da cretar of diamond rakhaa gaya

 jab tak 23 may ko nattejey nahin aa jate, main un aankadon par bharosa nahin karne vaala, jo eggzet pole ne hamen die hai
 It is not that i believe in a conspiracy theory that elections have been rigged, or evms have been tampered with
 main in par yakeen nahin karata, kyonki vaastaviktaa, jo mujhe dikh rahi he, isse bilkul alag he
 i may be wrong, or i may have missed seeing when India changed so much, but i need real figures to believe
 main maanata hum ki pichley paanch saal main desh main kuch had tak badlaav aayaa he
 It has become more 'hindu' than at any time before
 puraane vakt ke hindu apni hindu pahchaan kaa bakhaan karne se bachate the, lekin ab aisa nahin he
 This, i think, is the real 'contribution' of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 agar laalkrishna adwani ko is baat kaa shrey diya janaa chahie ki unhone hinduon ke ek hisse main yah bhaavana bhar di ki khaase bahusankhyak hone ke baavjood unke saath bhedbhaav kiya jaataa he, to modi ne usee bhaavana ko aisi vyapaktaa se dhaal diya, jisase vah jeet hasil kar saken
 Now only Muslims are no longer vote banks
 kahin bada hindu vot bank taiyaar ho chukaa he, jisane muslim vot bank ko lagbhag apraasangik bana daalaa he
 Prejudice against Muslims in a section of Hindus - Mahatma Gandhi mentioned it in his book Hind Swaraj in the year 1909 - has now created a new identity
 us purvaagrah ne vaastavik swaroop le liya he
 The way political Islam used to be, now political Hindus are also
 lekin bada sawaal he - kya rajnatik hindu hona itnaa bada ho gaya he ki vah apni aarthik pahchaan ko kho chukaa he
 
 
 The Doesn't it matter now that your sons and daughters are not getting jobs, and in the last few years your purchasing power has reduced drastically, and now you can go out and buy items like cars whenever you want
 
 
 ? ab yah myne nahin rakhata, ki bachat ghat rahi hai, or vyapaar ghate main chal rahe hai
 
 
 The Today's truth is that India, despite being the fastest growing economy in the world, is not in good shape
 har aarthik sanketak ek bhayaavah katha suna rahaa he or arthshaastri cheta rahe hai ki bharat dhire-dhire mandi kii disha main bad rahaa he, or aane vaale din samooche desh ke liye mushkilon se bhare honge
 i am not ready to believe that the new political Hindu is so disinterested with his economic identity that everyday problems do not matter to him
 aankade dikhaate hai ki berojgaare ne saare record tod daale hai, yah pichley 45 saalon main sarvocch str par he or iske kam hone ke koi asaar nazar nahin aa rahe hai
 The latest CMIE figures show that unemployment 8 in the third week of April
 4 fisadi ke sarvakalik oonche str par thi
 The government has consistently denied this figure
 darasal, sarkaar ne rojgaar ke aankade prakashit karnaa hi band kar diya he or usase judi agenciyaan in aankadon kii sachai par sawaal khadey karne lagi hai
 NSSO and CMIE figures are being mocked
 audyogic utpaadan gir rahaa he, vinirmaan tathaa sarvice sector ab laabhadaayak nahin rahe
 Consumption, especially rural consumption, has declined, auto sales have also fallen extremely badly in recent months
 maine apni pustak hindu raashtra main tark diya he ki samoochee janata ko sammohit kar lene ke liye 'swarg kaa vaada' behad kargar hathiyaar he
 We have seen this happening in demonetisation and soon after that
 sari duniya bhounchakki rah gai thi, jab notebandi ke baavjood BJP ne varsh 2017 main uttar pradesh main shandaar jeet hasil kar lee thi
 But after that, the way GST was implemented, people's suffering increased manifold, and that was the time when Modi's popularity was felt to be declining
 gujarat, karnataka, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan ke nateezon ne is baat ko sabit bhi kiya
 But it is difficult to believe that things have changed so much since December 2018, and people have forgotten all their suffering in such a way that they have decided to give Modi a better mandate than 2014 - while at that time He was considered a messiah, not a divider-in-chief
 2019 main modi vahi shaks nahin hai
 In 2014, he did not speak on contentious issues
 unhone vikaas ko mudda banaaya tha
 He promised jobs, promised to revive the country, he promised to bring the moon
 unhone vaada kiya tha ki vah bharat ko 'vishwaguru' bana denge
 He did not talk on communal issues
 hindu-muslim mudde unke agenda main nahin the
 He spoke of 'sabka Saath - Sabka Vikas'
 2019 main vah badal chuke hai
 He vigorously raises the issue of minorities and majorities when Rahul Gandhi decides to fight Wayanad
 vah khuleam un hinduon kii baat karte hai, jinhen 'jai shri ram' kaa naaraa lagane par pashchim bengal main pareshaan kiya ja rahaa he, or rajya main muslimon ko prashray die jane kii baat karte hai
 He resorted to the bravery of the army despite the order of the Election Commission
 unhone ding haanki, kaise unke netritv main, sena ne pulavama aatankwaadi hamale ke kade jawaab main aatankwaadiyon ko unheen kii dharti par ghuskar maaraa
 In 2014, the opposition was divided
 bhrashtachar ke gambhir aaropon kii vajah se congress sweekaarya nahin rahi thi
 In such a situation, Modi presented himself as a breath of fresh air
 varsh 2019 main vipaksh kii ekta kaa graph kaaphi ooncha he, haalanki yah behatar ho saktaa tha
 This time Modi, not Congress, had to answer whether he fulfilled the promises made five years ago
 or unka scorcard ummiifazah nahin lag rahaa tha
 The marketing of some government welfare schemes has been good, but was she able to get a second term
 mujhe shaq he
 Despite this, exit polls are trying to say that people are not only happy with his tenure, but are willing to give him a better mandate than before
 kaha jaataa he ki modi hameshaa apane kaan zamin se jodakar chalate hai
 If he had any idea of such results, as the exit poll suggests, he would not look as wobbly, tired and defensive
 modi ko khud ko aatmavishvaas se bharpoor dikhaanaa pasand he
 But at that press conference, which he never addressed, he was not at all real in his character
 vah behad chintit lag rahe the
 Was he acting? 
 
 ? mujhe nahin lagata
 Despite not believing in conspiracy theory, i am finding it hard to believe that these figures can be true
 main yakeen nahin karnaa chahta ki ye eggzet pole logon kii vaastavik soch or ichha ko parilakshith karte hai
 So, let's wait for the final results, the real results
 sirf tabhi ham kah paaenge ki kya bharat sachmuch vah ban gaya he, jo use nahin hona chahie
 Radiation emissions from mobile telephone towers will be reduced from the current level to a tenth of the level from Saturday
 isse mobile toweron se nikalne vaali vikiranon se aam logon ke swasthya par pratikul asar sambandhi chintaaen dur hone kaa anumaan he

 VIDEO: lifestil dijis bharat main 61 fisadi mauton ke liye jimmedaar a song composed by the Samajwadi Party (SP) for its national president Mulayam Singh Yadav's 'man Se Hain Mulayam and Aadhe Loha Hai' is gaining popularity in party programs
 lekin is geet ko likhane vaale mulaayam singh yadav ke shikshak 81 varshiya udai pratap singh ke liye yah kaam jivan kii sabase kathin chunautiyon me se ek tha
 Uday Pratap Singh, president of Uttar Pradesh Hindi Sansthan, who has written more than two dozen songs on Mulayam Singh, revealed aspects related to the lyrics written on Mulayam in a special conversation with 'india Today' in his office in Lucknow
 singh bataate hai, 'do maheene pehle mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne mujhe 1989 main america gayak billy joel ke behad lokapriy geet 've didant start da fire' kii dhun sunai or is par geet likhane ko kaha
 It was the toughest challenge of my life, because i had never written a Hindi song to the tune of an English song
 ' singh ke mutabik angreji gaanon main keval ridam hota he or kavita nahin hoti
 In such a situation, it was very difficult to compose poetry on English tune
 puraane netaaon kaa naam daal bithaaya dhun se talmeluday pratap singh bataate hai 'maine mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ko salaah di ki ve is kaam ko lokapriy geetkaar gopal das niraj ko saunpen
 They can do this work beautifully, but Akhilesh does not believe
 ek maheene kii mehnat ke baad udai pratap singh ne angreji dhun par 'man se hai mulaayam or iraade loha hai' likh daale jo in dinon party kaaryakramon main behad lokapriy ho rahe hai
 Singh says that in the beginning of the song, i included the names of the leaders associated with the socialist movement before Mulayam and kept pace with the tune and then mentioned the public welfare schemes of the SP government
 udai pratap singh 1958 main jain inter college karahal, mainpuri main angreji ke shikshak the
 Here, he studied English in Mulayam Singh Yadav's 12th standard
 padhai puri karne ke baad mulaayam bhi jain inter college main udai pratap singh ke saathi shikshak bane
 Uday Pratap Singh says, 'when Lohia Ji started the English Hatao Movement, i and Mulayam participated in it together
 yaheen se hamaara saath shuru hua jo ab tak barkaraar he
 'uday Pratap wrote the first song on Mulayam Singh Yadav in 1984 when he started the Kranti Rath Yatra in the state
 is geet ke bol the- 'keval netaa nahin mulaayam singh vah to ek vichaar he, jor julm kii takkar main vah jan jan kaa hathiyaar he
 After this, Uday Pratap wrote songs for Mulayam on several occasions
 1996 main jab mulaayam ne tisare morche ke gathan ke sapane ko hakeekat main badalane main kamyaabi hasil kii to udai pratap singh ne unke yashgan main likhaa, 'naam mulaayam singh he lekin kaam bada fauladi he, sab vipaksh kii bikhri takat ek manch par laa di he
 'uday Pratap Singh won elections from Mainpuri Lok Sabha seat from 1989 to 1996 and became a member of the tenth Lok Sabha
 iske baad jab mulaayam ne mainpuri ko apana sansadeey kshetra chunaa to udai pratap ko rajya sabha main jagah di
 After forming the SP government in UP last year, Mulayam had given the responsibility of the post of president of Uttar Pradesh Hindi Sansthan to Uday Pratap Singh

 yah pehali baar he
 Whether believe it or not, the BJP wants to woo the Muslims of West Bengal, who constitute thirty percent of the state's electorate
 yah jaanate hue kimamta banerjeeki ''muslim tushtikaran kii raajaneet'' par hamalaa karne ke baavjood hindu matadaataaon ke paryaapt vot party ko nahin mil rahe the, bhartiya janata party ne ab 'udaar' musalamaanon tak pahunchane kaa faisla kiya he
 On 19 February, the party's state unit will host a state-level conference for the Muslim community titled 'narendra Modi and the development of minorities'
 muslim buddhijiviyon, doctor, vakil or technocrates jaise peshewaron or anya logon ke saath dharmik netaaon ko isamen hissedari karne ke liye aamantran bheje gaye hai
 Speakers will include former journalist and Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta, state BJP chief Dilip Ghosh and Trinamool Congress rebel leader Mukul Roy
 bhaajapa mahasachiv debashri roy chedhri kaa kahana he ki yah musalamaanon ko un sabhi kaamon ke bare main 'suchit or shikshit' karne ke liye he, jo pradhanmantri ne unhen 'shashakt' banane ke liye kiye hai
 For example, she cites the "historic decision" related to triple talaq, which has come as a boon for millions of poor Muslim women
 na to congress or na hi kisi anya sarkaar ne aisa karne kii himmat dikhaai, bhale hi unhen musalamaanon ke dost ke rup main dekha ja rahaa ho
 "the time has come," Chaudhary says, when Muslims will know what the BJP government has achieved under Modi
 ve 700 karod rupye kii vaarshik haj sabsidi kii vaapasi kaa ullekh karti hai, jise ab muslim ladakiyon kii shiksha main lagaaya jayega
 She says that this is real development, not the appeasement policy of Congress and Trinamool Congress
 "we will also tell how Modi ji made Syed Mohsin Raza in Uttar Pradesh the Minister of Minority Affairs of Uttar Pradesh, while the party has a single Muslim was not given election ticket
 ''choudhary kahati hai ki bhagava sammelan main is par bhi dhyaan kendrit kiya jayega ki kaise bhaajapa shasit rajyon ne musalamaanon kii behatar dhang se seva kii he
 Such as Gujarat, where ten per cent of government employees are Muslim, while under the Trinamool Congress rule, Muslim participation in the government workforce in Bengal is barely three per cent
 ghosh kehete hai ki musalmaan barabari kaa haq chaahate hai, khayraat, daan yaa tushtikaran nahin
 The results of the Uluberia Lok Sabha by-election held on February 1 make it clear that the BJP should not even think of defeating the Trinamool Congress by ignoring the Muslim voters
 is seat par 40 fisadi muslim hai or trinmul congress kaa ummidavaar 4,74,000 voton se jeeta jabaki bhaajapa duusare sthaan par rahi
 Although his vote percentage definitely increased
 bhaajapa 19 farvari ke is aayojan ko is saal may-june main hone vaale panchayat chunaav ke lihaaj se bhi mahatvapurn maan rahi he
 *** smartphone companiyaan ab 5G smartphone laane kii taiyaari kar rahi hai
 Some companies are also testing 5G smartphones
 agle saal tak market main 5G smartfones dekhne ko bhi mil sakate hai
 But Apple does not want to rush for it
 report ke mutabik aipal 2020 main 5G saport vaale iphone launch kar sakati he
 According to reports, Apple will use Intel 8161 chipset for the 5G iphone in 2020
 is par kaam kiya ja rahaa he or sabakuch thik rahaa to yphone modem ke liye intel ko chunaa jayega
 Significantly, Intel is working on a chipset named 8160 which will be used for prototyping and testing
 fast company ne sutron ke hawaale se bataaya he ki aipal ne 5G modem ke liye mediatech se bhi baatcheet kii he
 But it is being described as Plan B
 mediatech bhi 5G modem par kaam kar rahi he, lekin aam taur par yah company bajet smartfones ke liye procesar banaati he
 The legal battle between Apple and Qualcomm is on, so there is no possibility of interaction with Qualcomm on the 5G chipset
 philhal aipal ne is report ke baat koi bhi bayaan nahin jari kiya he
 Talking about 5G network, by the end of 2019, telecom companies will start testing it
 philhal kai jagahon par isaki testing ho rahi he, lekin bharat main abhi isaki shuruyaat honi baaki he
 In 2019, smartphone companies will introduce the 5G feature as marketing by giving it a boost

 pichley paanch saal me pehali baar isi sijan main malaria se hui do mauton ke baad nagar nigam dilli ke chandra vihaar main fever survey main juta he
 Blood samples are being taken, but this action did not show there after the first death due to malaria in Shahdara in the month of July
 dilli ke chandra vihaar main 4 agast ko praveen sharma kii malaria se hui maut ke baad ab nigam vahaan survey kara rahaa he
 As soon as one gets information about fever, his blood sample is being taken
 tasadeeq kii ja rahi he ki kahin marij ko malaria to nahin
 East Delhi Municipal Corporation Assistant Malaria Inspector Prem Singh said that whenever someone dies due to malaria, we take a sample of the fever victim and send it to the clinic whether they have malaria or not
 itnaa hi nahin, maut kii khabar ke baad ilaake main foging bhi shuru ho gai he or spray bhi hone laga he
 With entry in sub register and in presence of doctors
 lekin nigam ke ravaiye se log naaraaz dikhe
 Meena, who owns a vegetable shop in Chandra Vihar, says the chain started after death
 nahin to kahaan aate hai ye log
 On the other hand, 55-year-old Surender laughs saying that sometimes when the corporation people are seen working in this area, then we consider ourselves lucky
 aaj ham khushnaseeb hai
 The comments lekin shahdara ke west jyotinagar anchlev main 13 july ko malaria se dam todane vaale 62 saal ke charan singh ke ilaake main nigam ne bukhaar peediton kaa koi survey nahin karavaaya
 The bus fogged in the area for Khanapuri and only sprayed medicine in their house
 shaayad yah berukhi isliye bhi ki media main inaki khabar ai hi nahin
 Charan Singh's son Narendra tells that there was fogging in the area
 mere ghar main spray kiya gaya
 There was no survey of malaria fever anywhere in the neighborhood, nor blood samples were taken
 is sijan main do maheene ke bheetar malaria se do mauton ke pehle beete paanch saal main dilli main or koi maut report nahin hui
 So the question arises whether malaria is spreading again in the capital
 
 
 ? After Praveen Sharma died of malaria on 4 August in Delhi's Chandra Vihar, the corporation is now conducting a survey there
 jaise hi kisi ko bukhaar kii jaankaree milti he, uskaa blad sample liya ja rahaa he
 It is being confirmed whether the patient has malaria
 purvi dilli nagar nigam ke assistant malaria inspector prem singh ne bataaya ki jab bhi malaria se kisi kii maut hoti he, ham bukhaar peedit kaa sample lekar clinics bhejte hai ki kahin unhen malaria to nahin
 Not only this, after news of death, fogging has started in the area and spray has also started
 sab register main entry ke saath or doctoron kii maujuudagi main
 But people appeared angry with the attitude of the corporation
 chandra vihaar main sabji kii dukaan karne vaali minaa bataati hai, maut ke baad yah silsilaa shuru hua he
 Otherwise where do these people come? udhar, 55 saal ke surendar yah kehete hue hans padate hai ki kabhi-kabhaar nigam ke log is ilaake main kaam karte dikh jaaen, to ham khud ko khushnaseeb samajhate hai
 Today we are lucky
 tippaniyan But in the area of 62-year-old Charan Singh, who died of malaria on July 13 in Shahdara's West Jyotinagar Enclave, the corporation did not conduct any survey of fever victims
 bas khanapuri ke liye ilaake main foging hui or sirf inke ghar main dawa kaa chhidkaav
 Perhaps it is also because of his displeasure in the media
 charan singh kaa betaa narendar bataata he ki yahaan ilaake main foging hui
 Sprayed in my house
 aasapados main kahin bhi malaria fever kaa na survey hua, na blad sample liye gaye
 There were no more deaths reported in Delhi in the last five years before two deaths from malaria within two months of this season
 to sawaal uthanaa lajimi he ki kahin malaria phir se rajdhani main paanv to nahin pasaar rahaa

 ? Is Nawaz Sharif disqualified for life or is there any hope of his return to the center of politics? This discussion and speculation is not limited to ordinary Pakistanis unaware of the legal nuances
 sharif ko saarvajanik pad ke liye ayogy tehraane ke supreme court ke faisle ke ek din baad kanoonee visheshgyon se lekar kanoonee paryvekshakon kii jamaat pasopesh main he
 When the question was presented to the veteran lawyers that how long Nawaz would stay away from the active politics of Pakistan, most of them did not show any clear answer
 pakistani akhbaar don kii ek report ke mutabik kuch kanoonee visheshgyon ne kaha ki is sawaal ko hal karne kii jarurat he, kyonki is par bahut lambey vakt se gaur nahin kiya gaya he
 a bench of five members of the Supreme Court disqualified Sharif under Articles 62 and 63 of the tajirat-e-pakistan
 supreme court baar association ke purv adhyaksh tarik mahmud kaa kahana he ki supreme court kii brihad peeth aise kai maamalon par vichaar kar rahi he, jinamein samina khawar hayaat or mohammad hanif kaa maamla shaamil he
 These include determining whether disqualification is permanent under Article 62 (1) (f) of the Constitution
 purv pradhan nyaayadhish anwar jahir jamaali ne aise hi ek maamle kii sunwaayee karte hue hairat jataai thi ki kya anuchhed 62 or 63 ke aadhaar par kisi ko hameshaa ke liye chunaav main hissaa lene par ayogy tehraaya ja saktaa he, kyonki log kuch samay ke baad praavdhaan ke tahat yogya hone ke liye khud ko sudhaar sakate hai
 Senior advocate Raheel Kamran Sheikh said that former Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani was disqualified under Section 63 five years ago in a contempt of court case with disqualification for five years
 shaikh ne kaha ki badakismati se samvidhan ke anuchhed 62(1)(epa) ke tahat ayogyata kii koi avadhi nahin he
 However, he approved of Mahmud
 unhone kaha ki kuch maamle lambit hai, jinamein yah nirdhaarit karnaa chahie ki he kya samvidhan ke anuchhed 62(1)(epa) ke tahanyogyata maujuuda chunaavatak yaa phir hameshaa ke liye hogi
 On the other hand, Ahsan Bhun, Vice President of Pakistan Bar Council, says that Sharif's disqualification is forever
 is tark ke samarthan main vah saal 2013 ke abdul gafoor lahari ke maamle kaa hawala dete hai, jisamen tatkaaleen pradhan nyaayadhish iftikar mohammad choudhary ne vyavastha di thi ki anuchhed 63 ke tahat kuch ayogyagtaayen asthai swaroop kii hai or is anuchhed ke tahanyogy ghoshitvyakti kuch avadhi bitne ke baad yogya ho saktaa he, jabaki anuchhed 62 ke tahat ayogyata sthaayee he
 He says that Article 62 does not provide for any such period after which a person disqualified will be eligible to contest the Parliament

 isi vichaar par chalate hue jammu-kashmir police aatankwaad kii raah chhod chuke kashmiri yuvaaon ke liye ghar vaapasi kaarykram chalaa rahi he
 Under this, Kashmiri youths who have come out of the jaws of terrorism are shown dreams of a golden future and the path to fulfill those dreams is shown
 ye kahani ek aise kashmiri yuva kii he jo pakistani aatankwaadiyon ke bahekaave main aakar aatankwaad kii raah par mud gaya tha, lekin ab wo aatankwaad kii pagadendi chhodkar mukhyadhara main lautne vaale kashmiri yuvaaon kaa poster bvoy ban chukaa he
 You may remember that the son of Kashmir who took a 'u-turn' on the path of terrorism, last year, the terrorist Danish Bhatt, who was seen in the crowd during the funeral of Hizbul commander Sabzar Bhatt, surrendered to the Handwara police
 iske baad wo saamaanya jindagi ji rahaa he
 22-year-old Danish Ahmed Bhatt is very happy in his new life
 wo un dinon kii yaadon par mitti daal rahaa he, jin dinon wo civil sarvice pariksha kii taiyaari ko chhodkar hijbul mujahidin main aatanki banakar bhartee ho gaya tha
 There was a lot of noise in the media when pictures of Danish Ahmad, a Hizbul Mujahideen commander, Sabzar Bhatt, were displayed during the funeral
 baad main danish ke hijbul mujahidin main bhartee hone kii khabar ne uske parivaar ko todakar rakh diya
 But now Danish has broken its path of terror and is part of the Jammu and Kashmir Police's Homecoming Program
 wo us din ko kosta he jab usne aatanki banane kaa faisla kiya tha
 When Danishdanish Ahmed was a student of BSC, when he became a terrorist of Hizbul Mujahideen, he was a bsc student in Doon PG College of Agriculture Science and Technology, Dehradun
 iske baad july 2017 main danish ne handwara main police or 21 rashtriya rifl ke saamne samarpan kar diya tha
 After the surrender, Danish had admitted that he had been given the responsibility of making the youth in North Kashmir a terrorist
 danish kaa kahana he ki dakshini kashmir main aatankiyon se saath kuch samay bitaane ke baad use aatankwaad main shaamil hone kii galati kaa ahsaas hua
 Recently, Sabir Khan, who has been awarded the Gallantry Award for Anti Terror Operations, has been entrusted with the responsibility of making Danish living off the path of terrorism a mainstream life
 sabir khan roj danish se milte hai or tabatak milte rahenge jabatak ki unhen puraa bharosa naa ho jaae ki danish ke dimag se ab aatankwaadi soch hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye nikal chuki he
 When will Danish return to normal life
 iskaa faisla sabir khan ko hi karnaa he
 Donates to his father's business, Danish now contributes to his father's business and is about to resume his studies
 use ummid he ki uskaa ateet uske sunahare bhavishya ke aade nahin aayega
 Danish is not the only Kashmiri youth who first took up a gun affected by terrorism, then left the gun and set an example by holding his books again
 danish ab un kashmiri yuvaaon ke liye prerana bhi he jo aatankwaad ke daldal main funskar apni or dusron kii jaan ke dushman ban gaye hai
 In 2017, when 130 Kashmiri youth became terrorists, terrorists have started re-establishing their roots in Kashmir valley
 Since then Pakistani terrorist organizations like jaish-e-mohammed, lashkar-e-taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen have kept a bad eye on Kashmiri youth
 jammu-kashmir police ke mutabik, saal 2016 main kashmir ghati main kareeb 70 sthaneey yuva aatankwaadi vichaardhaara se prabhavit hokar aatankwaadi ban gaye the
 At the same time, this figure doubled in the year 2017
 suraksha agenciyon ke mutabik pichley saal kashmir main kam se kam 130 sthaneey yuva aatankwaadi sanghathanon main shaamil hue
 The 'homecoming Mahayagya' for the stray sons of Kashmir
 jammu-kashmir police believe that terrorists coming from Pakistan are not as big a headache for them as they are Kashmiri youth who become terrorists and become enemies of their own people
 yahi vajah he ki jammu-kashmir police ne kashmiri yuvaaon ko aatankwaadi vichaardhaara se bachaane ke liye muhim chalaai he
 Which opens the doors to new life for wandering Kashmiri youth like Danish Ahmed Bhatt

 BJP candidate Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore from Jaipur Rural has said that Congress has come to the polls to weaken the state
 us party ko log vot nahin denge, jo dhara 370 ko barkaraar rakhane kii baat karti he
 There is talk of removing the army in Kashmir and abolishing the Special Protection Force Act of the Army issued in the states
 rathore kehete hai ki ham logon ke bich jaaenge or bataaenge ki congress agar aa gai to kis tarah ke halaat desh main paidaa honge
 Rathore alleges that even in this it has been said that a law will be made on the media as well

 jabaki unke saamne congress ne krishna punia ko maidan main utaara he rathore modi ke naam ke bharose chunaav maidan main rahane ke bajaay jaateey sameekaran bhi saadhane main lage hai
 Seeing the fight between Rajput vs Jat in Jaipur Rural, Rathore is trying to convince Congress's vote banks, Scheduled Castes, Tribes and Gurjars, to meet separately and that the BJP is their real party
 rajyavardhan singh rathore ne donon hi jatiyon ke samaaj ke logon ko unke mandiron main bulaakar samajhane kii koshish kii ki ve congress ke saath naa rah kar bijepi kaa saath den
 Although Rajyavardhan Rathore is not ready to speak anything even after repeatedly asking about Congress candidate Krishna Poonia
 darasal rathore kii ranneeti he ki vah puure chunaav prachaar main krishna punia kaa naam nahin lenge
 This is also the strength of the Congress because Krishna Poonia is an international player, so it can stand against Rathore
 raajnneeti main nai hai to unke upar koi aarope bhi nahin he

 ) An important meeting of the heads of the country's military, political and intelligence departments was taking place on December 2 inside the Prime Minister's Office in South Block
 baithak kaa agenda behad gambhir tha
 The options suggested by a dozen people in the room could lead to a fifth war between India and Pakistan
 yah baithak us ghatana ke sirf ek hafte baad chal rahi thi, jisamen 10 pakistani aatankwaadiyon ne mumbai ko nishaanaa banaakar 165 nirdosh logon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya tha
 After that attack, the whole country was angry and there was tremendous pressure on the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to take revenge

 Suggested options included special forces missions, covert attacks, attacks on camps for training terrorists on behalf of the Air Force and waging a limited war with Pakistan
 badale kii karrwai ke vikalpon kii jaankaree america ko bhi thi
 In the memoirs of former Pakistan Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmood Kasuri, Naid a Hawk nor a Dove, released in New Delhi on 9 October, the Bush administration reported Senator John Mannken shortly after the November 26, 2008 attack , Lindsay Graham and US Special Representative in Afghanistan Richard Holbrook were sent to Islamabad to assess the public's mood
 cold start manjuur naheembhartiya jaanchakartaaon ne march 1993 main mumbai serial bam dhamaakon or july 2006 main local train dhamaakon main pakistan kaa haath hone kaa pataa laga liya tha
 In both these attacks, more than 257 and 187 people were killed respectively
 lekin 26 / 11 kaa hamalaa alag kism kaa tha
 This was the first attack by Pakistani terrorists in which civilians and foreigners were targeted with deliberate brutality

 In his place Lieutenant General Milan Naidu, the Vice President of the Army, was attending the meeting
 pradhanmantri ne pakistan se nibatane ke liye gupïtachar vibhaag ke pramukhon se unki raay maangi
 Officials present at that meeting say that the Army's option was still negotiable up to that time
 ek vikalp cold start kaa tha, jisamen bhartiya sena kii yah yojana thi ki antarrashtriya seemaa par puri taiyaari kaa intjaar kiye bina twarit hamalaa kiya jaae
 When the Parliament was attacked in December 2001, it took more than a month for the army to make full preparations on the Pakistani border
 tab tak dandatmak hamale karne kaa avasar nikal chukaa tha
 The army had learned a lesson from it and developed a cold start, under which emergency military action could be carried out within a few hours, not a few days
 lekin leftinent general naidu ne kaha ki ve senadhyaksh ke 28 november ko dakshin africa ke daure se lautne kaa intjaar karnaa chahenge
 On the other hand, the Navy also had no option for swift retaliation
 nausena pramukh admiral surish mehta ne kaha ki unki sena abhi hamale ke liye taiyaar nahin thi or uske paas 'cold start' jaisi koi ranneeti nahin thi
 Intelligence agencies were angry with the Navy for not paying any heed to the warning that the exact location of the lashkar-e-taiba ferry waiting to enter India was given
 2013 main purv khufia contractor edward snowden ke khulaason se pataa chalaa ki central intelligence agency (siie) ne lashkar kii nauka or pakistan adhikrut kashmir (pioke) main sthit lashkar-e-taiyaba mukhyalay ke bich baatcheet ko pakad liya tha or 18 november ko ro ko uski jaankaree de di thi
 This was eight days before the terrorists attacked Mumbai

 lekin hamale ko safal banane or nagarikon ko nuksaan hone se bachaane ke liye unhen aatankwaadi training campon ke thikaanon kii sahi jaankaree honi chahie
 But intelligence agencies did not have such accurate information
 isliye sainya vikalp ko taal diya gaya
 Alternatives to the attack The second meeting of the security establishment of India, which took place on 2 December, was more focused on the option of military action against Pakistan
 us vakt tak manmohan singh sarkaar spasht taur par oparation parakram kii tarah kii yuddh kii taiyaari yaa cold start ke vikalp ko khaarij kar chuki thi
 Now only options for punitive assault against let were to be considered
 hamale ke thik ek saptaah ke baad bhartiya khufia agenciyon ne mumbai hamale main lashkar kaa haath hone kii puri tasviir taiyaar kar lee thi
 The confessional information behind the confession was a confessional statement from the terrorist Ajmal Kasab caught in the attack, several hours of conversation between the let man sitting in the Karachi control room and the Mumbai attackers
 sashastr bal, khaskar sena or nausena, ab bhi eliti ke thikaanon par hamalaa karne ke vikalpon ke liye taiyaar nahin the
 General Kapoor said that Pakistan can also respond to the attack, after which India will also have to give a titular answer
 sena ke vikalpon kaa suzav ek anpekshit paksh kii ore se aayaa tha—em
 K
 narayanan, jinhone vistaar se paanch vikalp saamne rakhe the
 In recent times, this was perhaps the first time that a variety of military options have been placed before the Indian government and all have been said to avoid full-scale war
 in vikalpon main sargical hawaii hamalon se lekar gupt karrwai or suraksha balon ke chaape tak shaamil the
 The first option was covert action against the let leadership in Pakistan
 teen anya vikalpon main eliti ke training campon or pioke main uske mukhyalay par hawaii hamalaa karne ke suzav die gaye the
 Indian Air Force fighter jets would carry out surgical (precision) attacks on let bases or attack special forces commando camps with helicopters so that ordinary civilians would not suffer any harm
 antim vikalp ke taur par simit yuddh shuru karne kii baat thi, jisamen hawaii hamalon ko sirf pioke tak hi simit rakhana tha taaki ladaai puri pakistani seemaa par na failane paae
 It is not clear whether these options were prepared after consultation with the Indian Army, but the three army chiefs were involved in the discussion and had given a thorough consideration of all options
 har sainik vikalp ko baariki se pesh kiya gaya tha or bharat kii har karrwai par pakistan kii ore se hone vaali sambhavit pratikriya ko bhi dhyaan main rakhaa gaya tha
 The action was confined to pok in all five options put forward by Narayanan
 bharat is hisse par apana daawa jataata aayaa he
 The first option, in which the let leadership was to take revenge attacks, was intensely considered, but was later rejected
 pataa chalaa ki bharat ke paas gupt karrwai kii kshamta nahin thi
 He did not have his own men in Pakistan

 gujral ne 1997 main pakistan ke bheetar ro ke gupt opareshnon ko band kar diya tha or unke baad aane vaale pradhanmantriyon ne apane khufia pramukhon ke un anurodhon ko khaarij kar diya tha, jinamein pakistan ke bheetar ro ke oparation ko phir se shuru karne kii baat kahi gai thi
 If action was taken by sending his commandos through infiltration, then like Kasab, he could be in danger of being caught
 baithak main shaamil adhikariyon ko dar tha ki aisa karne par bharat ko bhi pakistan kii shrenee main rakh diya jayega
 Officials of Indian intelligence agencies were not able to give accurate information about let leaders and locations of training camps to the army
 unke paas pakistan main gupt oparation karne vaale aise aadmi nahin the jo thikaanon ko tabah kar saken
 Nor could they provide the necessary intelligence in a short time
 aakhirkaar hawaii hamale ke vikalp ko tyaag diya gaya
 The last option was limited war, which was to be limited to pok only
 is ke tahat sena antarrashtriya seemaa par puri taiyaari ke saath jamaa hoti taaki pakistan yuddh ko pioke se baahar na le ja sake
 One of the reasons that complicated the Indian Army's action was that the US military was present in three airports and their airspace in Pakistan
 bhartiya vaayu sena ko apane hamale main arab sagar se hokar pakistan or afghanistan main aane-jane vaale america ladaaku vimaanon, bamavarshakon, dronon or transport vimaanon ko bhi bachaana hota
 The military chiefs thought that if war broke out, Pakistan could use its nuclear capability, given its limited military capability and the possibility of India's victory
 agar ladaai shuru ho jaati to jaruri nahin he ki pakistan bhi khud ko simit yuddh ke daayre main rakhata
 He could have threatened the use of nuclear weapons, causing the international fraternity to interfere immediately
 ek adhikari ke mutabik—agar bharat ko antarrashtriya dabaav ke kaaran yuddh rokna padataa to yah bharat ke liye thik nahin hota
 Thus the last option was also rejected
 paaya gaya ki bhartiya sainik mashin jo varshon kii upeksha ke kaaran khokhli ho chuki thi, paaramparik yuddh ke nazariye se nirnaayak nateeja nahin de sakati thi
 Unlike Operation Brastacks in December 1986 and Operation Parakram in December 2001, the armed forces were not deployed for the war on the Pakistan border in December 2008
 lekin ek baar phir yah saaf ho gaya ki lashkar-e-taiyaba jaise aatankwaadi sanghathan parmaanu kshamta vaale do padosiyon ko ek-duusare ke khilaaf yuddh main jhonkne kii kshamta rakhte hai

 Bajwa also spoke on the requirements to support and advance the Punjabi language and script
 unhone hawala diya ki veda or isaki shikshaayen sari sanskrit main hai lekin phir bhi sanskrit dhire-dhire darkinar hoti gai or dar he ki aage chalakar kahin punjabi lipi kaa bhi vahi hashr na ho jaae
 He reiterated that the loss of Gurmukhi script would also harm the works of Guru Nanak, as most of his teachings are recorded in this

 " pradhanmantri narendra modi (narendra Modi) ne rashtrapita mahatma gandhi (mahatma Gandhi) par yahaan sanyukt raashtra main apane vichaar rakhte hue kaha ki gandhi bhartiya the, lekin vah keval bharat ke nahin the or yah manch iskaa jeevant udhaaharan he
 Prime Minister Modi shared his views on Mahatma Gandhi at an event organized by India here
 modi samet vishwa ke netaaon ne yahaan sanyukt raashtra mukhyalay main gandhi saura park kaa bhi udghaatan kiya or gandhi kii 150veen jayanti par sanyukt raashtra ne unki yaad main ek dak tikat bhi jari kiya
 The Prime Minister's Office tweeted and said that while speaking on the topic 'relevance of Mahatma Gandhi in the contemporary era', Modi said, "gandhiji was Indian, but not only of India
 aaj yah manch iskaa jeevant udhaaharan he
 "modi said," You can imagine how impressed Gandhi's life was with whom he never met
 martin luther king junior (martin Luther King Jr) hon yaa nelson mandela (nelson Mandela), unke vichaaron kaa aadhaar mahatma gandhi the, gandhi ji kii soch thi
 "the Prime Minister said," Today the definition of democracy has a limited meaning that the people should choose the government of their choice and the government should work according to the expectation of the people, but Mahatma Gandhi emphasized the real power of democracy
 unhone vah disha dikhaai jisamen log shashan par nirbhar na hon or swaavlambee bane
 "he said," Mahatma Gandhi pioneered a social system that does not depend on the government
 yah sarvavidit he ki mahatma gandhi parivartan laae, lekin yah kahana bhi uchit hoga ki unhone logon kii aantarik shakti ko jagaa kar unhen swayan parivartan laane ke liye jaagrit kiya
 "he said," Even if Gandhiji was not responsible for the freedom struggle, he would have gone ahead with the basic elements of Swaraj and Swavalamban
 gandhi ji kii yah soch aaj bharat ke saamne badi chunautiyon ke samaadhaan kaa bada madhyam ban rahi he
 '' pradhanmantri modi ne kaha, ‘‘beete paanch varshon main hamane janabhagidaari ko praathamikta di he
 Whether it is Swachh Bharat Abhiyan or Digital India, the people are now leading these campaigns themselves
 ''modi ne kaha ki gandhi ne kabhi apane jivan se prabhaav paidaa karne kaa prayaas nahin kiya lekin unka jivan hi prerana kaa kaaran ban gaya
 He said, "today we are living in the era of" how to impress "but Gandhiji's thinking was -" how to inspire "
 ''modi ne kaha, ‘‘ chaahe jalwaayu parivartan ho ,aatankwaad, bhrashtachar ho yaa phir swarthparak saamaajik jivan ho, gandhi ji ke ye siddhant, hamen maanavtaa kii raksha karne ke liye maardarshak kii tarah kaam karte hai
 i believe that this path shown by Gandhiji will prove to be a motivator in building a better world
 ''pradhanmantri modi ne kaha, ‘‘ main samajhataa hum ki jab tak maanavtaa ke saath gandhi ji ke vichaaron kaa yah pravaah bana rahegaa, tab tak gandhi ji kii prerana or praasangikta bhi hamaare bich bani rahegi

After the Supreme Court's decision on the Rafale Deal, BJP has come to life
 sansad main ab tak baikfoot par dikh rahi bijepi faisle ke baad se vipaksh or mukhya taur par congress par palatwaar karne par utar ai he
 On Friday, there was a lot of uproar on Rafale in Parliament and the functioning of both houses was disrupted
 ab tak is deal ko lekar sansad main vipakshi dal sarkaar par hamalavar the, lekin faisle ke baad se bijepi or centre sarkaar ko palatwaar kaa mauka mil gaya he
 Recently, several meetings of the House have been an uproar over the deal and again the Rafale deal has become a major reason for the deadlock in Parliament
 sansad main kya-kya huapahale loksabhaa main bijepi saansadon kii ore se court ke faisle ke baad congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke khilaaf narebaaji kii gai
 BJP mps shouted 'rahul Gandhi apologize'
 udhar, vipakshi dal bhi apane-apane muddon ko lekar wel main aakar virodh pradarshan karne lage
 Opposition parties, including Congress, demand that the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) be investigated for the Rafale deal
 loksabhaa spikar sumitra mahajan ne kaha he ki agar vipaksh charchaa ke liye taiyaar he to vah rafel deal par charchaa kii ijaajat de sakati hai
 However, due to the uproar, the house proceedings have been adjourned till Monday

 In the Lok Sabha, Speaker Sumitra Mahajan tried several times to pacify the mps, but it did not show any effect

 In the Rajya Sabha, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley demanded a discussion on the Rafale deal
 unhone kaha ki congress is charchaa kii shuruyaat kare or unke ek-ek jhooth ko desh ke saamne rakhaa jayega
 The Congress party has been adamant on discussing Rafael for several days and demanding a probe by the JPC, but now after the decision of the Supreme Court, the government is also looking to discuss it
 ye bhi padhein:rafel par supreme court ke faisle ke baad bhi anuttarit rah gaye ye savaalcongress adhyaksh rahul gandhi rafel deal ko lekar sidhe-sidhe pradhanmantri narendra modi par aarope lagaate aae hai
 The Congress alleges that there has been corruption in this deal and Prime Minister Modi is responsible for it
 court ke faisle ke baad bijepi kaa kahana he ki rahul gandhi ne pradhanmantri ko badnaam karne kii koshish kii or desh ko rafel deal main bhrashtachar ke naam par gumraah kiya he, jiske liye unhen maafee maangani chahie
 Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said in the Lok Sabha that Congress President Rahul Gandhi has tried to mislead the country on the Rafael Deal and he should apologize to the House, the entire country
 rajnath ne kaha ki congress adhyaksh ne atanrarashtriya jagat main desh kii chhavi dhoomil karne kii koshish kii he
 Citing the decision of the Supreme Court, Rajnath has said that no question can be raised on the Rafael Deal
 unhone kaha ki congress kii sarkaar par bhrashtachar ke aarope rahe hai or inke mantriyon ko to jail tak janaa padaa he
 That is why the Congress tried to tarnish the image of the government and now the Congress Party and their president should come to the House and apologize to the country

 Fast bowler s Sreesanth believes that the way the young cricketers are getting popularity and a lot of money at the beginning of their career, they need a mentor to keep them from being misled
 srisanth ne kaha, ‘khel main aaj jis tarah se bahut adhik paisa or manoranjan shaamil he vaise main aapke paas yadi menter he yaa koi aisa vyakti jo ki aap ko sahi raah dikhaa sake to phir aap sahi raah par aage badhoge
 It can also be a coach or someone from the family who actually keeps an eye on the player and the player will also have to listen to him
 yadi aap pratibhashali or kadi mehnat karne vaale ho to phir aapako pareshaan hone kii jarurat nahin he’

 unhone kaha, ‘apane kaam par dhyaan kendrit rakhana vastav main mahatvapurn he lekin prayek kii apni nijee jindagi bhi hoti he
 It is important that he understand the line between stupidity and bravado '

 Sreesanth said, 'maybe the bowlers want to play for a long time
 ve 10 se 15 saal tak khelnaa chaahate hon
 The reason for this can also be fear of injury
 har din apana sarvshereshth pradarshan karnaa hameshaa behatar hota he
 Keeping your strength for the next match may also be the reason
 unhone kaha ki achche pradarshan se hi khilaadi team main apana sthaan banaaye rakh saktaa he or isse sambandhit dabaav kabhi bahaanaa nahin ho saktaa
 Sreesanth said, 'to be honest, you have to do well rather than complain
 visheshkar jab aap bhartiya paristhitiyon main khelte ho to dabaav hota he
 In fact it is difficult to perform well on arrival
 yah tej gendbaaj ke liye chunauti hoti he visheshkar ekadivasiy maichon ke powerple main lekin aapako tanaav ke in kshanon se paar paanaa hoga’

 The month of Sawan is celebrated all over the country as a festival and people have been following this tradition for centuries
 bhagwaan shiv kii puja karne kaa sabase uttam maheenaa hota he sawan lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki sawan ke maheene kaa itnaa mahatv kyon he or bhagwaan shiv ko yah maheenaa kyon priy he? aaie jaanate hai iske peeche kii manyataon ke bare main
 
 
 Importance of Sawan Mass
 
 
 shravan maas hindi calendar main paanchaven sthaan par aata hai or is ritu main varsha kaa prarambh hota hai
 Shiva, who is called the God of Shravan, is worshiped in different ways during this month
 puremah dharmik utsavhote hai or vishesh taur par sawan somvaar ko puja jaataa hai
 Sawan Mahotsav is celebrated with full enthusiasm in the country of India
 bhagwaan shiv ko kyon priy he sawan kaa maheenaa?kaha jaataa hai sawan bhagwaan shiv kaa ati priy maheenaa hota hai
 The belief behind this is that Daksha daughter Mata Sati gave up her life and lived a cursed life for many years
 uske baad unhone himalay raaj ke ghar parvati ke rup main janm liya
 Parvati worked hard throughout the month of Savan to get Lord Shiva in her husband form, which pleased Lord Shiva fulfilled his wish
 apni bharya se pun: milaap ke kaaran bhagwaan shiv ko shravan kaa yah maheenaa atyant priy hai
 This is the reason that this month Kumari Kanya prays to Shiva for good groom
 manyata hai ki sawan ke maheene main bhagwaan shiv ne dharti par aakaar apane sasuraal main vicharan kiya tha jahaan abhishek kar unka swaagat hua tha isliye is maah main abhishek kaa mahatv bataaya gaya hai
 According to mythology, according to the religious belief, the sea was churned in the month of Saavan, in which the Halahal venom was discovered by Lord Shiva, due to which he got the name of Neelkanth and thus he saved the creation from this poison
 iske baad sabhi devataaon ne un par jal daalaa tha isi kaaran shiv abhishek main jal kaa vishesh sthaan hai
 In the rainy season, Lord Vishnu goes into Yoganidra and at this time the whole creation becomes under Lord Shiva
 at: choumasa main bhagwaan shiv ko prasann karne hetu manushya jati kai prakaar ke dharmik kaary, daan, upwas karti hai

 But when and how these funds were being reached, it was not well known
 abtak jo saboot mil rahe hai, uske mutabik ye paise hawala ke jariye hi math tak pahunchaae gaye hai
 If the investigating agencies have found the Chinese connection of the money received from the monastery of Karmapa, then it will obviously become a big evidence of Chinese intervention in the Indian border

 bollywood main ek or produsar baccha dastak dene ja rahaa he
 Prabhudeva's 'ramaiya Vastavaiya' is releasing soon and producer Girish Kumar, son of producer Kumar Taurani, is making his Bollywood debut with this film
 bade parade par pehali baar aa rahe girish ek khatarnaak "surfing" seen kar rahe he jo ajtak bollywood kii filmon main pehle kabhi dikhaai nahin diya he
 This is a unique scene in Bollywood
 itnaa hi nahin to kuch seens bahut hi anuthe hai jo pani ke andar shoot kiye ja rahe hai or iske liye khaas taur par america ke hawaii se international export "christopher bryan" ko bulaayaa gaya he
 This scene is done by Girish himself
 prabhudeva girish ko lekar alag tarah ke seen karnaa chaahate the or isliye kaaphi soch-vichaar ke baad unhone pani ke neeche ekadam anuthe seen karne kaa faisla liya
 Along with surfing expert 'leon Ingram', many experts from all over the world were called to shoot the scene and also had backup support ready at the location during the stunt
 lekin girish ne surfing ke saare seens khud hi kiye
 Ramiya Vastavaiya stars Girish Kumar and Shruti Haasan in the lead role
 film 19 july ko relies ho rahi he
 Producer Vasu Bhagnani's son Jackie Bhagnani has yet to perform a miracle at the box office
 See how Girish leaves an impression on the hearts of the audience

 He not only gained independence from his colonial masters, but also bestowed that freedom in the most courageous way possible
 kabhi-kabhaar uthal-puthal ke dauron ke baavjood umang or aashaa kii vah udaan jari he
 During the past seven decades, when most of our neighbors were miffed with all kinds of subjugations, our freedom flight turned into an enduring tale of bravery and firm intentions

 is prakriya main beshak kuch puraani gadbaditaan bhi ho gai hai
 However, they also maintain the common foundations of the same freedom where the clamor of aspirations is present and being fulfilled
 haari hui jangaisi hi ek aazaadee vah he jise kai deshon main pehle se hi aajamaaya ja rahaa he
 This is the freedom to consume substances for recreation
 duusare lafjon main, "nasha karne kaa adhikaar''
 Like all old civilizations, we have a double attitude towards aesthetic pleasure
 20veen sadi ne duniya bhar main 1960 or 1970 donon dashakon ke nashile or maadak daur dekhe, jab jan shiksha, yatra or vaanijya kii shakti se otprot ek vaishvik yuva samskruti apane dam par takat banakar khadi ho gai
 In those days, societies took very strong legal measures to deal with the increase in the use of various types of recreational drugs
 1980 kaa dashak amal kaa daur tha
 To be more clear, the era of war against drug abuse
 nashe ke khilaaf jang kii aguai america ne kii or usee ne isamen sabase zyada paisa lagaaya
 The paradox is that it was hailed as a land of independent people and had been the target of anger and resentment of the western world for over three decades
 duusari jagahon ke samaaj nashile padaarthon par 1961 ke sanyukt raashtra sammelan or uske baad kii antarrashtriya sandhiyon ke tahat apni jimmedaariyon se bandhe the or 1970 ke dashak main unhone apni vidhaayi or pravartan mashinari ko taiyaar karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 By the mid-1980s, the international system against the production, distribution and consumption of recreational drugs was largely established
 in kanoonon or agenciyon ke khilaaf sakriy or failaa tha ek pachmail jamaavada jisamen utpaadakon or vitarakon ke cartil ke alaava sabase ahm ve lakhon upabhokta the jo is kanoon ko taak par rakhkar mujarimon kii jindagi basar karne kaa jokhim uthaane ke liye taiyaar the
 Simply because they believed that doing so would lead to a life of independence
 aap maanakar chal rahe honge ki is jang kaa nateeja to pehle se tay hi rahaa hoga
 Every year we hear great success stories in which government agencies catch tons of marijuana or quintals of cocaine and burn them out in a spectacular display of public relations
 alabatta, is sabakaa in padaarthon kii street price yani roj-roj badalati or ghoshit se kam keemat par, or na hi inke milane or khapat ke staron par, koi fark padataa maaloom detaa he
 It is a really strange battle in which even if we win the battles, there remains doubt about the outcome of the war
 dhire-dhire, jaisaa ki yon kranti ke maamle main hua, pashchim main nashe kii aazaadee ko lekar aam logon kii raay badal rahi he
 Some of the reason for this is the destruction caused by the war against narcotics and some reason is the changing concept about freedom itself
 2011 main pahiyaa tab puraa ulataa gum gaya jab sanyukt raashtra ke purv mahasachiv kophi annan, purv america secretary of state jorge shulj or america fedral rigerv ke purv chairman paul walker sareekhee do darjan pramukh hastiyon kii sadsyta se las global kamishan on drug policy ne apni lambii-chaudee report main kaha ki "nashile padaarthon ke khilaaf vaishvik jang naakaam ho chuki he or iske duniya bhar ke logon or samaajon ke liye vinaashkari nattejey hue hai''
 The report analyzed the devastation created by this war and advocated as an alternative that the use of narcotics be made largely non-criminal for those who do not cause any physical harm to others
 is rukh ko kamishan kii 2017 kii report main or vistaar se rakhaa gaya jiskaa sheershak thah "nashile padaarthon kaa istemaal karne vaale logon ke khilaaf purvagrahon kaa muqabla karnaa
 The Hindustani experience of drug control laws and implementation has been as much a combination of successes and failures as the experience around the world
 hamane bhi 1985 main ek behad sakchat kanoon narcotic drugs and psycotropic substances (andipies) act banaaya jo 1961 ke pehle sammelan se shuru hokar tamaam sanyukt raashtra sandhiyon ke tahat hamaari baadhyataaon ke anupaalan main taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 During the more than three decades of the existence of the NDPS law, it was criticized in many quarters and cited as an example of alleged police misbehavior, more similar to the notorious Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (prevention) Act or TADA
 police afasar hone ke naate main kahuunga ki asal dikkat hamaari pravartan agenciyon ke haathon is kanoon ke amal main nahin he, balki dikkat us buniyadi falsafe main he jo is kanoon kii jad main hi he
 When you make a strict law, there is a possibility of misuse of it
 hindustan main nashile padaarthon ke khilaaf jang hamaari paaramparik samskruti main narkotics padaarthon ke istemaal ke samrudh or jatil itihaas ko dekhte hue or bhi bidambnaa se bhari he
 Like other forms of entertainment like music and art, the consumption of all substances is also interwoven in religious practices
 jis tarah dakshin america shaamnavadi anushthanon ke liye ayuvaska or mescalin sareekhe matibhram paidaa karne vaale padaarthon kaa seven karte hai, usee tarah bhaang or charas kaa seven naga akhaadon kii shaiva puja paddati ke saath abhinn taur par judaa hua he
 If you go to the Kavad Mela to be held in Haridwar or any one of the four Kumbh Melas in four cities, you will see Charas celebrating
 iskaa istemaal yahaan zyada khatarnaak nashe kii taraf le jane vaale shuruaati nashe ke kii taur par nahin, balki shiv kii bhakthi ke taur par hota he
 Similarly, the use of opium is widely accepted in large parts of the country and in the society
 in prathaon or dasturon ko aapraadhik banane se bhi inaki khapat par lagaam kasne main koi madad nahin mili he
 All it did was hand over another tool to harass people
 yon dasturon kii tarah hi yah vah ilaaka he jisamen sarkaar nijee aazaadee ke aage yah jang roj-ba-roj haar rahi he or rajyasatta kii naitik takat or nijee swatantraaa se isaki baari keemat chukaa rahi he
 This is a battle that the state cannot win
 vivek or garima ke saath peeche hatakar ise gaiyr-aapraadhik bananaa or medical research tathaa sabooton ke aadhaar par niyam-kaayade lagu karnaa hi iskaa akelaa samaadhaan he

 rajasthan sarkaar ke adhyadesh ko lekar siyaasi galiyaaron main chal rahe aarope-pratyarope ke bich congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne rajya kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Rahul tweeted on Sunday that 'madam Chief Minister, we are living in the 21st century
 yah saal 2017 he, 1817 nahin
 In fact, the Vasundhara government has issued an ordinance that no judge, magistrate or public servant will be investigated without any approval from the government
 rahul gandhi ne isi adhyadesh ko lekar mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 According to this ordinance, no public servant can come under scrutiny on a decision taken in the course of his duty, except in the Code of Criminal Procedure 197 wherein a competent officer at the government level must allow procedure within 180 days
 agar 180 din ke andar prosicution kii ijaajat nahin detaa he to swayan hi ijaajat maan lee jaaegi
 Why only 1817 in Rahul's tweet? Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has blood relation with Scindia Gharana
 1794 se lekar 1827 tak gwalior main daulataraav sindhiya kaa shashan tha
 In 1816, the British sought cooperation with the Scindia house to suppress the Pindaris
 kuch samay tak sindhiya gharaana angrejon ke aamantran par uhapoh kii sthiti main rahaa, agle saal 1817 main purna sahyog kaa vaada karte hue gwalior kii sandhi hui
 The media also cannot disclose, the ordinance issued in September 2017 states that no media can release the name and identity of any judge, magistrate or public servant unless the competent authorities of the government allow it
 criminal lau rajasthan amendament ardinance 2017 ke naam se jari is aadesh se saaf taur par media par gag order laga he ki kisi bhi adhikari kii pahchaan wo tab tak ujagar nahin kar saktaa jab tak sarkaar ke str par sakasham adhikari isaki ijaajat nahin de
 Ordinance brought to save whom? Assembly session in Rajasthan is starting from October 23
 aise main is tarah ke adhyadesh laane par vasundhara sarkaar par kai tarah ke sawaal uth rahe hai
 The ordinance states that since the Legislative Assembly does not exist yet
 lihaaja adhyadesh laana jaruri he
 To save who is in such a hurry, this ordinance has been brought
 ise lekar har taraf charchaa ho rahi he
 Home Minister Gulabchand Kataria says that this ordinance has been brought to protect honest officers
 koi bhi eemaandaar adhikari kaam karne main darataa he ki koi jaanboojhkar juthi shikaayat kar use fansaa degaa
 On the other hand, social activist Kavita Srivastava says that this is a black law in the state
 isaki aad main bhrashtachar kiya jayega or media bhi kuch nahin kar paaegaa
 What is 1 in the ordinance of Vasundhara government
 rajasthan sarkaar bhartiya dand samhita main sanshodhan ke liye adhyadesh lekar ai he, jise 23 oktober se shuru ho rahe vidhansabha satr main bill ke rup main paarit kiya jayega
 2
 is adhyadesh ke anusaar kisi bhi locasevak (sarkari karmchaaree) jaj yaa magistrate ke khilaaf koi karrwai rajya sarkaar ke ijaajat ke bina nahin hogi
 3
 kisi bhi locasevak ke khilaaf koi bhi exiaar darj nahin kara saktaa he
 The police also cannot register an FIR
 4
 No court can go against any public servant nor judge can give any order against any public servant
 5
 No media can make allegations against a public servant without the permission of the government
 6
 Permission from the government has to be taken before any public servant's complaint
 180 din ke andar sarkaar ke str par sakasham adhikari ijaajat degaa or 180 din ke andar ijaajat nahin de paaya, to uski sweekruti apane aap maan lee jaaegi

 Tensions between India and Pakistan remain equal
 magar philhal aisa bhi nahin ki donon desh khud ko jang main jhonk den
 But suppose that if both countries jump into the war and then somewhere nuclear war between India and Pakistan started, what will happen? The picture would be terrible
 ek hafte main hi do karod das lakh log maare jaaenge
 More than half of the people will be scorched by the heat of the bomb
 jo bachenge wo radiation se maare jaaenge
 Half of the world's ozone layer will be wasted
 aadhi duniya se sardi-garmi kaa mausam hi khatm ho jayega
 Nuclear winter will destroy the world
 vanaspatiyon or ped-paudhon ke nishaan tak mit jaaenge
 Half of the world's two billion people will die of surf starvation
 aadhi duniya bhugtegi khamiyajab sirf hindustan or pakistan kii nahin he
 Half the world is at stake
 ji haa, agar galati se bharat-pakistan ke bich jang hoti he or us jang main donon desh apane sirf aadhe parmaanu bam kaa hi batan dabaa den, to hindustan or pakistan main to ek jatke main hi do karod das lakh log maare jaaenge
 But its effect will have to be faced not only by the neighboring countries but also half the world
 khaufnak hoga asarbharat or pakistan ke paas jo parmaanu bam hai
 Each of them is equivalent to a 15-kiloton bomb dropped on Hiroshima
 ye bam jaise hi girenge sabase pehle isaki garmi, tapish or radiation logon ko maaregi
 Even after that, it will not be easy for those who survive
 bhopal gas ke tees saal baad aaj teesri peedi bhi biimaar paidaa ho rahi he
 Then it is a nuclear bomb
 andaja lagaaie iskaa asar kitna lanbaa or khatarnaak hoga
 The effects of radiation of ozone layer will be ruined, not only will people suffer, but they will die of sesame seeds by other methods and results
 vaigyanikon kii maane to itane radiation se vayumandal main ozone parat barbaad ho jaaegi
 The disappearance or ruining of the ozone layer from the atmosphere now means that the gas will be removed from the air which changes the weather
 yani aadhi duniya main sardi-garmi ke fiks mausam kaa silsile hi band ho jayega
 In such a situation, it is very possible that after this war, such a terrible cold will occur that only the name-marks of trees and plants can be erased from the world
 aise main insaanon kii haalat kya hogi ye saza ja saktaa he
 If more than 2 crore people will be killed, according to scientists, in the face of nuclear war between the two countries, 2 crore 10 lakh people will die in the first week
 mauton kaa ye aankada duusare vishwa yuddh main maare gaye logon kii taadaad ke mukaable aadhi hogi
 Not only this, this figure of death will be 2 thousand 221 times more than the total number of common people, police, jawans and security forces killed in terrorist attacks in the last 9 years in India
 kehane kaa matlab he ki is vakt aatankwaadi insaan or insaaniyat ko jitna nuksaan pahunchaa rahe hai, parmaanu yuddh usase 2 hazaar guna zyaada insaanon kii jaan legaa
 The condition will be that from a large area of the world, trees and plants will disappear
 vegetesan yani ped-paudhon kaa naamo-nishaan bhi khatm ho jayega
 And for this reason only about 2 billion people will be starved
 ye aankade 2013 main bhautik vaigyanikon ke antarrashtriya sanghathan ne parmaanu yuddh rokane ke liye kiye gaye ek adhyayan ke baad jari kiye the

 simba ke superhit song ''aankh maare'' main arshad varsi, tushaar kapur, kunal khemu or shreyas talapade kaa kemeo najar aayaa tha

 China's famous tight rope walker Adili Wuxar, a man who walks on a tight rope, holds the world record for the longest walk in Titrop
 vuksar ne bards nest stadium main lagaataar 198 ghante tak titarope walking kar ginis book of world records main apana naam darj kara liya he

 The 'lemon-chilli' debate is taking place in India these days
 rakshaamantri rajnath singh ne aar bi 001 rafel vimaan ko france se kharidne ke maukey main kuch aisa kar diya ki vipaksh ne unka majaak bana daalaa
 But the side taunted the opposition's joke and wired it
 muslim netaa asauddin ovaisi ne haidarabaadi andaaj main modi sarkaar ko ek naseehat tak de daali kyon na seemaa par neembu mirchi taang den, desh par aane vaali sari alaaen balaayein tal jaaengi
 Actually the Defense Minister placed two lemons under the wheels of Rafael, made a swastika on top of the aircraft and worshiped it
 vaise hi jaise ghar main kisi gaadi ke laane par hindu dharm ke log karte hai
 People divided into different factions clashed over it
 dakshinpanthi jo hindu dharm ke khilaaf kuch sun nahin sakate, vampanthi jo rakshaamantri ke neembu-mirchi aasthaa ko cond bataakar ise dharm ko badhaava dekar alpsankhyakon par dabaav banane kii niti ke taur par dekhte hai
 The discussion about the purchase of Rafael fell behind to argue in favor and opposition of the shattered Lemon Mirch
 vaise bhi in dinon bharat hi nahin balki duniya ke bade-bade desh bhi dhruvikaran yani do charampanthi soch ke logon main bant chuke hai
 Now see, people will also say that why do people get into such silly discussions? Why are such issues given? After all, what does it matter? But the truth is that such extreme thinking proves to be effective weapons for 'polarization'
 samajhnaa yah jaruri he ki aakhir yah dhruvikaran hota kaise he?to is dhruvikaran kii prakriya ko samajhane ke liye bheed nahin balki vyaktigat soch ke tareeke ko samajhnaa hoga
 Psychologists also conducted several studies to understand polarization
 is aadhaar par kai thiyari bhi taiyaar huin
 Learn the psychology of political polarization-1-personal approach theory: According to this theory, people who do not assess their performance are extremist
 matlab udaaravaadi nahin balki is paar yaa us paar kii soch rakhane vaale
 Such people do not even learn from their mistakes
 is tarah se soch ko 'metacognitive skill' kehete hai
 Now these people will be of either right-wing or left-wing ideology
 udaaravaadi bilkul bhi nahin
 Such people do not listen against their opinion at all
 2-ek approach he, jiskaa sambandh aasapaas ke vaataravaran se he
 As such, the emergence of 'right wing' is visible in India these days
 to kya ye sab nae dakshinpanthi hai? aisa nahin he
 Actually, the political atmosphere of the country did not support this thinking earlier
 secularism yaa dharmanirpekshata yaa phir chhadam dharmanirpekshata kahen to bhi galat nahin hoga ko poshan kiya gaya
 But as soon as the power started airing the right wing, people whose ideas were still sleeping with no air
 darshanik 'irik hofer' ne ek niabandh likhaa 'da tru biliver'
 Irik wanted to see what is the motivation behind communism or Nazist movements? How a big movement stands up
 to ve is nishkarsh par pahunche ki logon ke bheetar supt padi soch ko jab apni jaisi soch ke log milte hai to ve usase jud jate hai
 And stand up a movement
 haalanki kai baar netaa itnaa prabhaavshaalee hota he jo na keval supt padi soch ko jagaata he balki aapaki soch ke rukh ko bhi badal detaa he
 3-eco Chamber Effect: The most important Eco Chamber effect is to understand
 soshal media (ap, fasebuk, twitor or na jane kya kya) ke jamaane main har rajnatik dal apane agenda ko failaane main sakasham he
 Social media notifications constantly matching your thinking keep coming on your phone
 darasal aap ne ateet main jis tarah kii post ko clic kiya he, waisi post aapke soshalmedia main lagaataar girti he
 You do not even know when the fine line of your thinking turns into a deep gulf through these posts
 chunaav ke dauraan to yah kamaal kaa hathiyaar sabit hoti he
 For example, if a political party is able to get 55 percent votes then B
 45 percent
 jaahir he 55 pratishat vot vaali party hi vijeta hogi
 But at 55, not all a party supporters will be strong
 agar 10 pratishat log bhi is us taraf se is taraf aa gaye to nateeja ulataa ho jayega
 Now it will depend on how many qualified people have been hired by which party to promote their agenda
 isiilie to raajnneetik jeet haar kaam par nahin balki uske sandeshvaahakon kii chunaav ranneeti par nirbhar karti he

 sharaab mafia sarkari kaayade kanoonon kii dhajjiyaan udaae to baat samaj main aati he
 But if the government keeps its rules in check, then the victim said plead
 aisa hi ho rahaa he chhattisgarh main
 The BJP government of the state has been selling liquor itself since April 1
 lekin wo bhi sharaab thekedaaron ke lathaiton kii tarj par
 When the government could not find a shop to sell liquor in Raipur, a liquor shop was opened on a part of a drug store
 logon ne pehali baar dawa or daaru kaa sangam ek saath dekha
 But this is not the case
 is sharaab dukaan ke thik bagal main praathmik skool he
 Whereas the government has made a rule that the halls will be at least 100 meters away from religious places and schools
 chhattisgarh kii rajdhani raipur ke posh ilaake shankar nagar kaa yah maamla he
 This school has been running on the main road here for almost 20 years
 iske thik bagal main pehle dawa dukaan hua karti thi
 But now this liquor store has opened between the school and the drug store
 ek april se yah sharaab kii dukaan apane pure shabaab main he
 From morning to night, there is a crowd of alcohol enthusiasts
 logon ne pehali baar dawa or daaru kaa anoothaa sangam dekha he
 Actually, in this area, people did not give their premises and shops to open liquor shops, then the administration narrowed the part of the drugstore
 dawaaon ke rank ek ore kar partishan kiya gaya or raaton raat sharaab dukaan khol di gayi
 While doing all this, the administration did not pay any attention to the fact that there is a school right next to the liquor shop
 wo bhi kareeb 20 saal purana
 Neither the drug dealer has any objection to the liquor store nor do the alcohol enthusiasts
 lekin afat tut padi he is skool ke chaatro or teacheron ke upar
 Their objection was overruled
 ilaake ke logon ne bhi is sharaab dukaan kaa virodh kiya
 But his voice too was submerged like the sound of a burrow
 philhal padhai likhaai chhod is skool ke chaatro or unke abhibhavakon kaa vakt sharaab dukaan hataane kii maang ko lekar hone vaale anshan main biit rahaa he
 According to the excise rules of the state, in no case should there be religious places and schools around it to open a liquor shop
 in donon sthalon se sharaab dukaanon or ahaaton kii duuri kam se kam 100 meter ke antar main honi chahie
 But this rule was taken away
 prashasan or aabkaari vibhaag or police ke afasaron ne maukey kaa sthal parikshan kiya
 After this, the drugstore portion was narrowed and allowed to open liquor shop in it
 jabaki dawa dukaan kholane ke liye jo drug license jari kiya jaataa he
 It contains a complete map of the drugstore
 iske baad hi dawa dukaan kaa license jari kiya jaataa he
 In this case, the drug store was divided into a liquor shop without a NOC from the Health Department's Chemist and Druggist Department
 philhal prashasan jaanch kaa hawala de kar apana pallaa jhaad rahaa he
 While the Excise Minister of the state claims that the government has taken the liquor business in public hands
 chhattisgarh main sharaab dukaanon ko kholane ke liye rajya kii bijepi sarkaar ne edi chotii kaa jor laga diya he
 So far only about two and a half hundred shops have been opened out of about twelve and a half hundred shops of domestic and foreign liquor
 isse rojaanaa sarkaar ko lakhon rupee kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 In fact, there is tremendous opposition from the state liquor shops across the state
 pradarshnkaree sharaab kii dukaane kholane nahin de rahe hai
 On the other hand, the government is running a string of laws to open these shops

 uttar pradesh main kisaanon kii karj maafee ke mukhyamantri adityanath yogi ke faisle ke baad ab maharashtra sarkaar bhi karj maafee ke raste talashne main jute gai he
 Giving information in this regard, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said that the state government will study the model of agricultural loan waiver of Uttar Pradesh
 yogi model kaa adhyayan karenge fadanavismaharashtra vidhansabha main shivasena or bijepi sadasyon ne maang kii thi ki rajya sarkaar pareshaan kisaanon ke liye karj maafee kii ghoshnaa kare
 Fadnavis responded to this in the assembly and said, "we are trying to give debt relief to 31 lakh farmers
" iske liye ham yah adhyayan karenge ki upi kaise itani badi rakam jutayega
 Fadnavis also said that he has directed the Finance Secretary of the state to study how Uttar Pradesh will fulfill its promise of debt waiver
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri ne tamilnadu main krishi rin maafee par hoicourt ke nirdesh kaa hawala dete hue ne kaha, tamilnadu main karj maafee kaa maamla bilkul alag he
 The decision of farm loan waiver is the prerogative of the state government and the court in Maharashtra will not need to give such instructions for loan waiver
 bataa den ki tamilnadu main kisaanon ke shantipurna pradarshan ke baad hoicourt ne rajya sarkaar ko krishi rin maaf karne kaa nirdesh diya tha
 Fadnavis announced in the Legislative Assembly, we are studying to implement agricultural loan waiver
 karj maafee ko lekar shivasena kii maang se ham sahamat hai or ham jald hi is par faisla le lenge
 congress-ncp had demonstrated before the announcement of Fadnavis, opposition parties had demonstrated outside the assembly on this demand
 congress or ensipi ke vidhayakon ne uttar pradesh kii tarj par maharashtra ke kisaanon ke bhi karj maaf karne kii maang karte hue vidhansabha ke baahar narebaaji kii
 Leader of Opposition in Maharashtra Legislative Council, Dhananjay Munde, says in question, "how can the same party in two states have two different stances on debt waiver?" He says, "during the current session of the Vidhan Sabha, more than 100 farmers have given their lives in the state
 sarkaar ko is par shame aani chahie
 In the meantime, Shiv Sena has welcomed CM Fadnavis' statement on debt waiver
 shivansena vidhayak pratap sarnike kehete hai, 'sadan kii kaarywahi shuru hote hi hamane upi or tamilnadu kii tarj par maharashtra ke kisaanon ke karj maaf karne kii maang kii
 If Yogi Adityanath can decide this within 16 days of assuming power, then why not Maharashtra? The attitude of the Chief Minister (fadnavis) is also positive on this and he has asked the Finance Secretary to report on it
 ham ummid he ki jald hi samaadhaan nikalegaa
 'before that, Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray had congratulated Yogi Adityanath for waiving the farm loans of farmers and said that the Maharashtra government should also follow this step

 Business of crores
 
 
 kidnaping
 
 
 And a ransom of 100 crores
 
 
 ek aisa apharan he, jo hua to desh ke pashchimi kone par maujuud ek chote se dweep par
 
 
 But the fabric of its plot was woven together with the 6 states of the country
 patna se takreeban 50 kilometre dur chhapra jile ke ek gaanv main khushi kaa maahaul tha
 People were dancing and singing, as the procession was coming out of this house
 lekin isi baraat ke peeche is makaan ke ek kamare main wo raaj dafn tha, jiske bare main koi soch bhi nahin saktaa tha
 Because on the one hand there was a marriage in this house, a crowd of people gathered
 daavat udayi ja rahi thi
 On the other hand, in a room of this house, a young man incarcerated for the last twenty days was waiting for his release
 duusare lafjon main kahen to apni azaadi ke liye ghadiyaan gin rahaa tha
 But the question is, how could a young man be imprisoned in a packed house where hundreds of people had come and gone, due to the tremendous movement due to marriage? The question is also what was the crime of this young man after all? And who had held him here in this state? In response to these questions, that strange story of kidnapping is hidden, which can be difficult for anyone to believe
 ek aisa apharan jisamen chand siyasatdanon or pulisavaalon kii shah par ek arbapati kaarobaari ke bete ko agava kiya gaya
 He was imprisoned for 25 days and a ransom of 100 million was sought
 kyonki ye thi ab tak kii sabase badi kidnaping
 The young son was attacked by miscreants who attacked a factory in Daman and there was silence in a family in Surat
 kyonki badmaashon ne is ghar ke noujvaan bete ko agava kar liya tha
 But after this, the demands that the miscreants put in front of this family, the demand was neither kept nor heard till now
 desh ke centre shasit pradeshon main se ek daman main is rose jo kuch hua, uske bare main koi soch bhi nahin saktaa tha
 Suhail Hingora, the son of wealthy businessman Hanif Hingora, was kidnapped from his factory by a gang of armed goons when he arrived at the factory as usual
 is vaardaat ne surat ke rahanevaale hingora parivaar ko baichaiyn kar diya
 This was a big shock for him
 noujvaan suhail jitna tej-tarraar tha, utana hi smart bhi
 He was a karate black belt holder
 lekin hathiyaaron se las gundon ke aage uski ek na chali or agle chand minuton main use uthaa kar badmaash daman se dur nikal chuke the
 After this, when Suhail did not return till late, the family came to the police, but the Daman police could not find any specific clue about Suhail
 isi bich do din guzar gaye or phir vahi hua jiskaa dar tha
 Call from unknown numbers
 Now some unknown numbers started calling on Suhail's father Hanif Hingora's mobile
 kol karanevaale ne kaha, 'tumhaara betaa suhail hamaare kabze main he
 If you want his interest, then arrange for a hundred crores of rupees
 idhar, tumne rupye die or udhar tumhaara betaa waapas laut aayega
 And yes, if you try to do any tricks, the result will not be right
 'ye baaten sunate hi hingora parivaar main sannata pasar gaya
 The ground slipped under Suhail's father Hanif Hingora's feet
 ab gharavaalon ko ye baat samaj main aa gai ki unke laadle ko badmaashon ne agava kar liya he
 And there is only one way to release the son, that is to fulfill the demand of the kidnappers
 lekin ye maang jitani badi thi, uske bare main soch kar bhi hingora parivaar ko paseene chhot rahe the
 Every time the ransom was called from a new number, the Hingora family was waiting for the next call
 udhar, daman police badmaashon kaa pataa dhundhane ke liye puri tarah chaukanni ho chuki thi
 After this the family received several phone calls one by one and each time the kidnappers threatened to return the son if Suhail's family did not give the money as soon as possible
 lekin, is baatcheet or tamaam koshish ke baavjood police aparankartaaon kaa pataa nahin laga saki
 The reason is that whenever the police tried to trace the numbers calling the Hingora family, the number was switched off
 hairaani ye bhi thi ki har baar phiroti ke liye ek nae number se kol kiya ja rahaa tha
 The gang was spread from Daman to Odisha and Uttar Pradesh
 The gangsters had made full preparations before abducting Suhail
 udhar, police suhail ke ghar aanevaale har number kaa servilans shuru kar chuki thi
 
 
 But this time also the police got confused
 tafteesh ke dauraan use pataa chalaa ki suhail ke gharavaalon ko jin numberon se telephone kiya ja rahaa he, wo number odisha or uttar pradesh ke hai
 
 
 That is, SIM cards of those numbers were bought from Odisha and Uttar Pradesh
 
 Apparently, the gang of kidnapping miscreants was not a minor, but a gang that stretched from Daman to Odisha and Uttar Pradesh
 or tamaam koshishon ke baavjood suhail ke asli thikaane ke bare main police koi bhi ore-chor nahin mil rahaa tha
 Meanwhile, a long time passed and then a thing happened that shocked the Hingora family
 
 
 ab unke bete ke ghar lautne kii ummid nazar aane lagi thi
 Now almost a month after Suhail was kidnapped, the family members were constantly talking to the kidnappers about the ransom
 kyonki hingora parivaar amir to tha, magar itnaa bhi amir nahin tha ki wo sau karod rupye kii phiroti itani aasaani se chukaa dete
 On the other hand, while talking to the Hingora family for so many days, the miscreants had also realized that their victim could not get them hundred crores of rupees
 baharhaal, isi bich gharavaalon ne aparankartaaon ko takreeban 9 karod se 25 karod rupye ke bich kii koi rakam dene kii hami bhari or badmaashon ne is rakam ke badale suhail ko reeha karne kaa faisalaa suna diya
 Now a month later, the happiness of the Hingora family was now returning
 or badmaashon ne suhail kii rihaai ke liye jo jagah bataai, usne ek baar phir hingora parivaar ko ghuma diya
 The miscreants said that Suhail's release would be with the Gandhi Setu of Patna on paying the ransom
 to kya suhail ko itane dinon tak kahin bihar main chipa kar rakhaa gaya tha?gharavaalon kii muraad hui puribaharhaal, wo vaqt bhi aayaa jab gharavaalon kii muraad puri hui
 And on 28 November, Suhail was handed over to his family members near Gandhi Setu in Patna
 yani karodon kii phiroti ke is khel main suhail kii jaan batch gai
 There were still many questions, to which no one had answers
 masalan, akhir suhail ko agava kisne kiya tha? use bihar main kahaan chipa kar rakhaa gaya tha? daman se lekar bihar tak is gang ke log kahaan-kahaan chhipe the? sawaal kai the, lekin sabake sab ansulajhe
 Abducted by the dish number ID number of the dish connection, now Suhail had escaped from the clutches of the miscreants and reached Surat, and the police had also come to his house to ask him the address of the kidnappers
 vaise to apharan ke vakt badmaashon ne use nashe kaa injection laga kar behosh kar diya tha or maheene bhar use ek kamare main band rakhaa gaya, yahaan tak ki rihaai se pehle bhi uski ankhon par pattee bandhi rahi
 But despite this, Suhail finally told the policemen the address of the house, where he was imprisoned for so many days
 darasal, suhail ne kaidwale kamare main lage televijan set ke dish conection kaa idi number yaad kar liya tha or das dijit kaa ye idi number police ke liye sabase bada suraag sabit hua
 Just by this link, the police reached this house in Chhapra Chaturpur village
 or suhail ke bataae mutabik is kamare main chipaaya gaya uskaa roomaal or idi card bhi police ne yahaan se subut ke taur par baraamad kar liya
 The police arrested a young man named Ranjit from here, the same Ranjit, who was married during Suhail's imprisonment here
 jabaki kuch din baad ranjit kaa pita naagamani singh bhi police kii jaal main funs gaya, jo khud jharkhand police kaa sab inspector tha
 But still the police is looking for many miscreants including Ranjit's two brothers Deepak Singh and Sonu Singh in this case
 jinhone sau karod kii kidnaping kaa ye puraa jaal-batta desh ke chah rajyon main failaa rakhaa tha

 Significantly, Saif al Arab was the youngest of Gaddafi's six sons
 aatankwaad or charampanth se puri duniya jujh rahi he
 In such a situation, this letter of a 6-year-old child gives a chorus that there is hope and humanity in the world
 kehane ko to uski umr sirf 6 saal he lekin uski charchaa sanyukt raashtra sangh main bhi he
 The reason is that boundaries don't matter to him
 wo maanata he ki duniya kaa har baccha dost ban saktaa he
 Whether it is from Iraq or Syria
 uske liye naam myne nahin rakhata
 He does not recognize people by his name and religion
 
 
 insaan ko sirf insaan maanata he or insaanon ke saath to insaaniyat se hi pesh aana chahie
 
 
 Isn't it, a 6-year-old American child has written a letter to President Barack Obama
 chitthee main likhaa he "main syria ke us rifuji bachche ko apane ghar main rakhana chahta hum
 i want to make him a part of my family
 " ye baat usee syrian bachche ke liye kahi gai he jo khun se lathpath, dhul main sanaa hua ek jagah chupchaap main baitha tha
 Whose picture had once again stoned the world and warned them to stop it all
 
 
 ladaai band karo
 The name of the child writing the letter is Alex and the Syrian child is Omran Dakhnish
 hamaare or aapaki tarah elex ne bhi omran kii tasviir dekhi
 But apart from us, he thought of making this child a friend
 jab baraak obama ne ye chitthee padhi to unki ankhen bhar ain
 Obama, who gave big and diplomatic speeches, could only say that this is a letter of a child who has not yet learned to condemn
 use shaq karnaa nahin aata he or wo darataa nahin he
 This video of Obama has been shared over 60 thousand on Facebook
 khat kaa asar dekhie, yun to white house main bahut si chitthiyaan aati hongi lekin white house ne khud is chitthee ko publish kiya he
 This is how Alex started his letter
 
 
 dear president obama,kya aapako wo baccha yaad jise aap syria se ambulance main laae the?kya aap krupa karke use mere ghar laaenge
 
 
 We will wait for you aapke swaagat main ham jhande, phool or gubaare lekar khadey rahenge
 We want to make him a part of our family
 mai use apana bhai banaaunga
 Obama also mentioned this letter at the United Nations summit
 obama ne jor dekar kaha ki ham sabhi ko elex se bahut kuch siikhnaa he
 Later, the White House also recorded Alex with this letter
 'big bos 10' ke pehle din se hi contestant bane tantric baba om swami kaa khub bolbalaa he
 Before making the entry at home, there are plenty of people who claim to have made Salman the world's biggest star and to cross the rest of the contents of the house
 tivi screen par inaki jhalak dekhte hi darshakon ke jahan main ek hi baat aati he ki dekhen ab baba kis contestant ko apni tantra shakti kaa hawala dekar kya vardaan dete hai
 To be fair, from the first 2-3 episodes of 'bigg Boss 10', the contentants have started cutting from Baba
 yahaan tak ki salmaan bhi sho ke opening de par baba ke bartaav se hairaan najar aae
 These are the things of this Baba that are really disturbing the audience and the contestants due to nonsense, they are really strange: 1
 baba kaa salmaan se daawa karnaa ki unke liye aisi ladki dhund lee he jise vah khud bhi shaadi karne se inkaar nahin kar paaenge
 Not only this, he will also try to make Salman the world's biggest star with his tantra knowledge
 2
 The contestants of the house may not have met the boys as many as they are meeting Boba Om Ji
 gauri surat se lekar man kii sundarataa ko bhaanpane vaale baba sho kii contestant ko kabhi ye kehete najar aa rahe hai ki itani gauri ho, koun se desh se ai ho
 So someone says that you are very beautiful not only from outside but also from the mind
 main tumhen tumhaare mukaam tak pahunchaaungaa
 3
 saream tivi sho par mahila ko tamaacha jadne vaale ye baba big bos ke ghar kii femail contestant ko saraswati, durga, lakshmi kaa rup maanate hai or kehete hai, 'ab mujhe deviyon ke liye puja karne kii chintaa nahin he kyonki mere saath ye sabhi saakshaat deviyaan hai
 '4
 baba kii ek or baat bahut niraali he ki sawaal jisase marji poocha jaae, jawaab vahi dena chaahate hai
 For the moment like Mandeepika Padukone, who reached the show, must have wondered where she got stuck
 pehle to baba ne unhen saakshaat lakshmi kah daalaa kyonki baba ko darasal deepika kaa naam nahin pataa tha or kaha ki 'main inhen achche se jaanata hum, ye to saakshaat lakshmi hai
 As long as Deepika stayed in the house, Baba did not let anyone else talk to Deepika, Deepika would have a question with someone else, but Baba is that he would put his leg in front of someone
 5
 From the first day, Contestant was seen treating Baba with respect, but now Baba is seen knocking the Contestant out of his absurd things
 pichley hi episod main to manu punjabi, manavir gurjar or baaki sadasyon ke liye to ab baba jaise majaak hi ban gaye
 When Baba said that he did not cry as soon as he was born, but started speaking
 yah sunakar sabhi hairaan the or ek contestant ne to yah tak kah diya ki 'paidaa hote hi bole kya the, ye to bataaen
 Eyebrow eyebrow or something like a dog
 'khayr ghar kaa maahaul dhire-dhire garmaataa najar aa rahaa he
 Because Baba may have seen the Contestant in his monstrous form or rather, in real terms
 dekhte hi dekhte swami ji lopamudra or monaalisa ke naak main dam karte najar ae or ab aane vaale episods main ye dekhnaa hoga ki is baba ke prakope se gharavaale khud ko kaise bachaate hai

 BJP leaders met President Pratibha Patil under the leadership of their senior leader LK Advani and complained about the 'unconstitutional behavior' of Karnataka Governor Hansraj Bhardwaj and demanded his removal
 raashtrapati se mulaakaat karne gayi bhaajapa ke pratinidhimandal main karnataka ke 23 saansad bhi shaamil the
 The leaders complained that Bhardwaj has been making statements against the state government ever since he became governor in June last year
 bhaajapa netaaon ne kaha ki ‘sanvaidhanik vyavastha behaal karne ke liye’ bharadwaj ko hataaya janaa ‘jaruri’ he
 After meeting Patil at Rashtrapati Bhavan, Advani told reporters, 'we appealed to the President to call the Governor of Karnataka back as he is adopting an extra-constitutional and confrontational approach
 gyaapan main hamane aise kai udhaaharan bataaye jinase sabit hota he ki vah shuruyaat se hi raajnneetik agenda apanaaye hue hai
 'BJP leaders have complained to Pratibha when Bhardwaj and Karnataka Chief Minister B
 es yediurppa ke bich tanaav bad gaya he
 This tension has increased after the Governor gave his approval to register an FIR against the Chief Minister in a corruption case
 bharadwaj kii niyukti ko desh main ‘loktantr khatm’ karne kii disha main uthaaya gaya kadam qaraar dete hue bhaajapa ne kaha ki rajyapal kaa ‘najariya or bartaav’ asangat or samanaantar uddeshyon se prerit he
 He is acting less like a constitutional officer and more like a Congress worker
 yediurppa par lage bhrashtachar ke aaropon par uthaaye gayi kadam ke chalate bharadwaj kii aalochana karte hue bhaajapa ne kaha ki rajyapal raajnneetik kaarnon ke chalate durbhaavna nahin rakh sakate or khud ko jaanch ayog yaa lokayukta ke sthaan par nahin maan sakate
 In the memorandum, the BJP referred to several public statements made by the Governor of Karnataka against the Chief Minister and said that 'publicly such statements are usually made by opposition leaders
 aise bayaan sarkaar ke sanvaidhanik pramukh nahin diya karte
 Advani also reminded that Sushma Swaraj, Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha and Arun Jaitley, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, had also made Prime Minister Manmohan Singh aware of the subject a few months ago
 nafarmani vaale rukh main najar aa rahe yediurppa bharadwaj ke saath apane vivaad ko kal rashtriya rajdhani tak le jaye jab unhone rajya main ubhare siyaasi halaat se nipatane kii ranneeti taiyaar karne ke makasad se party ke varisht netaaon se mulaakaat kii
 This political situation has emerged in the state following the Governor's approval to prosecute Yeddyurappa for his alleged involvement in land scams
 karnataka se saansad or bhaajapa ke varisht netaa venkaiya naidu ne maujuuda halaat kaa dosha congress par madhte hue kaha ki puure prakaran main ‘sutaradhar’ congress alaakaman he or karnataka ke rajyapal ‘patrdhar’ najar aa rahe hai
 The instructions are meeting the High Command and the Governor is playing the role of taking steps
 yah poochne par ki kya raashtrapati se mulaakaat karnaa party ke paas uplabdh aakhri vikalp tha, unhone kaha ki pratibha patil ke samaksh is mudde ko rekhaankit karnaa jaruri tha
 Naidu said, 'I want to know whether the Congress is trying to set an example that the governor of any state can order prosecution of the Chief Minister on the basis of just a few complaints
 ’ unhone aagaah kiya ki agar congress or centre ‘vivek kaa istemaal kiye bina’ rajyapal ko samarthan dena jari rakhega, to desh bhar main arajak sthiti utpann ho sakati he
 Naidu said, "if the governor wants to govern in this way, go against the mandate and does not perform his constitutional duty, then a chaotic situation will arise across the country
" ’ Vishwa Hindu Parishad's International President Ashok Singhal has simultaneously targeted the Maharashtra ATS and Congress investigating the Malegaon blasts

 He accused the ATS Pir of misconduct and said that the ATS was trying to discredit Hindu organizations like Bajrang Dal
 unhone centre sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki sarkaar har morche par vifal rahi he
 Singhal objected to the term Hindu terrorism and said that it was a conspiracy to malign saints and saints
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki vot ke liye hindu sanghathanon ko nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
