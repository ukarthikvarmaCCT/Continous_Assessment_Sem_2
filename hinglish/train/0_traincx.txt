 Whoever is made the chairman of the regulatory board associated with it should have complete knowledge of DNA technology

 sarkaar badalati he to desh ke mahapurushon ke bare main najariya bhi badal jaataa he
 If the ruling governments give importance to their emblem, then the leader of the opposition also becomes the attacker
 rajasthan main pichhali bhartiya janata party (bijepi) sarkaar ne schuli shiksha ke paathyakramon main badlaav karte hue vir saavarkar ko mahaan krantikari or swatantraaa sangram kaa yoddha bataaya tha
 The Congress government, which came to power, changed the course and added to the syllabus of Veer Savarkar that Savarkar came out of jail after being apologized four times, being fed up with the British torture
 rajasthan kii skulon main dasvin kaksha ke bhaag-3 ke paathyakram main desh ke mahapurushon kii jeevani ke bare main padhaayaa jaataa he
 The previous BJP government had disappeared the first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru from the chapter of great men
 saath hi vir saavarkar par ek chapter likhaa tha, jisamen unhen mahaan swatantraaa swatantraaa senaanee bataaya gaya tha
 The biography of Veer Savarkar was written as a great revolutionary
 satta main congress ne aate hi ghoshnaa kii thi ki bijepi sarkaar ne jo paathyakram badale hai, unki samiksha kii jaaegi
 After review, the new syllabus has now been prepared
 chaatro ko jo nai kitaaben banti ja rahi hai unamem ek baar phir se vir saavarkar kii jeevani main jod diya gaya he ki cellular jail main angrejon kii yaatnaaon se itnaa tang aa gaye the ki saavarkar ne 4 baar angrejon se maafee maangi thi
 Later he was also ready to work with them
 paathyakram main aae is parivartan ko lekar bijepi ke netaaon main aakrosh he
 Changes in syllabus, Govind Singh, Education Minister of Rajasthan government said that in this case it is said that the government does not make syllabus, there is a committee of academics for it and academicians decide what to teach
 sarkaar paathyakram ke maamle main hastkshep nahin karti he
 On the other hand, the Congress is giving the same old logic that the BJP government used to argue on the last change in the syllabus
 haalanki sarkaar kii safai par naa to tab bharosa tha or naa hin ab bharosa he or rahi baat shikshavidon kii to vahaan bhi vichaardhaara ke str par bantwaaraa ho chukaa he

 Concerned about the future of Test cricket, Laxman lobbied for the start of day-night matches in Test cricket and the youngsters who took care of T20
 unhone bisisiai dwaara yojit mansoor ali khan pataudi smriti vyaakhyaan main kaha, cricket ke bhavishya ke liye test cricket kaa astitv bahut jaruri he
 This should be the biggest concern for administrators
 hamen nahin pataa ki din-raat kaa test takneekee jaruraton ko puraa karegaa yaa nahin, lekin nayepan ke kaaran darshak jarur ise dekhne aaenge
 He said in a speech of about half an hour, after a day's work people will come to the ground and enjoy the game for a few hours
 koun jaanata he ki isse test cricket main ruchi phir jaag jaae
 He said, it would be a good initiative to take Test cricket for five days under floodlights at places where extreme heat and low dew fall
 lakshmana ne sweekaar kiya ki in dinon test cricket main ruchi bahut kam ho gai he
 He said, it is no fun to play in front of the empty galleries
 test cricket ko bachaane ke tareeke talashne honge
 Laxman also said that he also likes T20 cricket
 unhone kaha, tii20 cricket ne kai aayam khole hai
 The audience is guaranteed entertainment in three hours, much like cinema
 hamen aisa tarika talashna hoga ki donon praaroop saath rah saken
 He said, despite having old thoughts, i like T20 cricket a lot
 main tii20 cricket khelnaa pasand karata
 It makes you think differently
 lakshmana ne divangat mansoor ali khan pataudi ke prati bhi sammaan vyakt kiya
 He said, i feel great giving lectures in the memory of the youngest Test captain, one of the pioneers of Indian cricket
 unki anginat uplabdhiyon ke alaava vah bhartiya cricket ke pehle superstar the, apane samay se bahut aage

 sarkarein agar hameshaa janata ke saath hotin to isi bharat desh main isi vakt main alag-alag sarkaron ke kilaaf saikadon kii sankhya main virodh pradarshan nahin chal rahe hote
 If you choose the government, you are there but it is not always yours
 ye baat jaanane ke liye metric paas hona zaruri nahin he
 That is why we change the government after five years or wait for change
 is desh main apni zamin bachaane ke liye logon ko sarkaron se goli khaani padi he
 Governments turned their citizens into terrorists by false cases and spent twenty years in prison
 puraa itihaas bharaa padaa he, virodh ke nae nae hausalon se
 In every round, an opponent comes who gives that round a new status
 raajnneetik dal hi sirf virodh nahin karte hai
 People of the ruling party get all kinds of facilities when they protest
 police unka saath detii he
 The government supports virdohi dal ke liye thodi chunautiyaan hoti hai magar unke paas bhi takat hoti he
 This facility is not available to all the workers' organizations, farmer laborers and professional organizations
 virodh ke liye tamaam tarah ke sanghathan kii zarurat hoti he
 Political parties do not oppose every issue
 jaise agar aap abivipi or enesayuai se kahenge ki aap berojgaare or mahangi shiksha ke kilaaf desh bhar kii rajdhaniyon main pradarshan karen to ve katthak karne lagenge
 Because where they raise their voice, it is possible that their party can have a government
 dilli ke jantar mantar jaaiye
 Try going from the state capital to the district headquarters
 log kin paristhitiyon main apni maang ko lekar virodh pradarshan kar rahe hote hai
 In all of these, his opposition is the biggest one who raises his voice alone
 jab tak koi akelaa awaz uthaane vaala hota he tab tak yah ummid bhi bachi rahati he ki koi he
 Those who remain silent or ignore it only understand when they are victims of violence of government and society and call a leader or reporter
 gurmeher cor kaa virodh isliye bada tha ki usne apni baat kehane ke liye sanghathan nahin banaaya
 His opposition became greater when his voice was reacted by the Union government minister
 grih rajya mantri kiran rijiju ko kaayade se gurmeher cor kaa hausala badhanaa chahie tha magar unhone uske kilaaf tippanee kar sari sarkaar ko uske kilaaf kar diya
 Hence the opposition of Gurmehar Kaur is big
 gurmeher cor ne virodh to jataayaa tha ki wo abivipi se nahin darati hai
 When she spoke alone, the weak world of social media ran that someone spoke
 shaayad viral hua or phir gurmeher cor ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 Everyone criticized the ABVP and the ABVP also responded, but a girl was afraid to speak alone that she is not afraid of ABVP
 is baat ko pal bhar main gaayab kar diya gaya or saamne laayaa gaya ek saal purana video, jise gurmeher cor ne kisi or sandarbh main you-tub par daalaa tha
 Now he was attacked with the help of that video
 is hamale main grih rajya mantri tak shaamil ho gaye
 The BJP MP said that Dawood Ibrahim also did not use the father's soldier to justify his anti-national
 zaahir he gurmeher kaa akelaapan or bad gaya or uskaa saahas bhi
 What was Gandhi's biggest contribution? unhone aam se aam logon ko is dar se azaad kar diya ki bina lathi ke banduukon se las or 200 saal se jami british hukumat kaa virodh kar sakate hai
 Without fear
 is buniyadi dar se jo bhi azaad karaane nikalataa he, samaaj or sarkaar ko dar lag jaataa he
 You go to Twitter and see what language has been used against Gurmehar
 ye isliye ki koi ladki sarkaar police dekh kar chup rahe
 Did not say
 magar ladki thodi ziddi nikali kah diya ki darati nahin he
 Now she has said that she has lifted her voice, now she will be silent
 baat sahi bhi he
 She is not scared, she has now put it on you that if you can stand with a single girl then show up
 koi ram sahab hai jo bharat or pakistan ke bich yuddh ke khilaaf hai
 Encourage peace
 vahi you tub main aise sandesh daalate hai
 On 28 April 2016, Gurmehar had posted this video in Hindi and English for him
 gurmeher cor is video main bataa rahi hai ki jab wo do saal kii thi to uske pita shahid ho gaye, chah saal kii thi to ek burkevali ko maarane kaa bhi prayaas kiya kyonki use lagata tha ki mere pita kii maut kii zimmedaar vahi he
 His mother then explained that my father was killed by war, not by Pakistan
 usne yahi likhaa ki nafrat ko bhoolanaa sikh liya
 It was not easy but not too difficult
 agar main aisa kar sakati hum to aap bhi kar sakate hai
 Today i am a soldier just like my father
 main bharat or pakistan ke bich shanti ke liye ladati hum kyonki agar yuddh nahin hua hota to mere pita aaj mere paas hote
 The world speaks against war
 sabko pataa he ki yuddh insaaniyat kaa dushman he isliye chhutbhaiya se lekar bade netaa shanti kii baat karte hai
 When Gurmehar put this video on youtube, a young Pakistani man Faiyaz Khan supported him
 abhi tak aapane mitra desh suna hoga, shatru desh suna hoga, faiyaaz khan ne gurmeher cor ke saath ek nae desh kii kalpana pesh kii
 Sibling country means siblings' country
 ham zindagi main isliye aate hai nayaa or kuubasurat sochane
 Fayyaz Khan lives in Australia
 6 may 2016 ko ye video you tub par daalaa
 There is some Ram sahib who runs a movement on You Tube to encourage peace between India and Pakistan
 usee video main faiyaz kehete hai
 
 
 Hi Gurmehar Kaur, i am Fayaz Khan from Pakistan
 jab main pehali baar australia aayaa to sabhi bharatiyon ko vaise dekhtaa tha jaise mujhe skool main sikhaaya gaya tha
 But soon we started eating in the class room, sharing chairs as if we were close friends
 kargil yuddh main tumhaare pita kii maut par ham sabhi ko afsos he
 i have seen war, have seen deaths in my hometown of Swat but have not lost any member of my house by luck, but i have thousands of Gurmehar Kaur around me
 main bharat aana chahta hum bina kisi viza kii pabandi kii
 We will fight together against these restrictions
 seemaa ke donon taraf hazaron logon ko gurmeher cor kii tarah takalifon se guzaranaa na pade, ham iske liye ladenge
 i cannot give you the love of your father, but of course you have got a brother from the enemy country
 chalo is duniya main ek anokhaa rishta banaate hai jahaan bhai ek musalmaan he or bahan ek sikh
 Now this enemy country replaces the word with Sibling country
 matlab bhai bahan kaa desh kar dete hai
 This effect was from Gurmehar's video
 gurmeher cor ke video ke khilaaf bhi kai video aa rahe hai
 He is also being criticized
 hamaara focus is baat par he jab koi akeli ladki bolti he to kya hota he
 Go to Twitter and submit the abuses given to Gurmehar Kaur
 nari devi he ke naam par nautanki karne vaale samaaj kii pole khul jaaegi
 What is the point, Gurmehar Kaur posted the video that she is not afraid of ABVP
 magar use kinare karne ke liye ek saal purana video nikaala gaya or is tarah pesh kiya gaya jaise wo pakistan ke khilaaf ladate hue maare gaye sainikon kii qurbaani ko chota kar rahi he
 Is using her father
 dhundne waalon ko usee you-tub par yahi video mila hoga lekin unhone aap tak yah baat nahin failaai kyonki koshish he ki aap rashtrawaad ke naam par sankate rahen
 Keep giving the feeling of violence inside you a chance
 gurmeher ke post ne jo hasil kiya wo hazaar mixilon se bhi duniya main ajtak kahin bhi hasil nahin ho sakaa he
 Sibling Country
 bhai bahan kaa desh
 We did not use the word martyr
 ham nahin karte hai
 You ask why we do not use martyrs, who answer
 or ye jawaab grih rajya mantri kiren rijiju ne loksabhaa main diya he
 In reply to the question of Lalganj MP Neelam Sonkar on 22 December 2015, the Minister of State for Home Affairs said that "the Ministry of Defense has informed that the word 'martyr' is not used in the context of any casualties in the Indian Armed Forces
" isi prakaar kisi kaary yaa kaarywahi ke dauraan kendriya sashastr police balon or assam rifles ke javaanon kii mrityu ho jane ke sandarbh main bhi aisa shabd prayukt nahin hota he
 The same answer was given by former Minister of State for Home RPN Singh in Lok Sabha on 18 February 2014 that the government has never defined the term martyr
 abivipi ko kiren rijiju se poochna chahie ki desh ke liye jaan dene vaale sainikon ke liye shahid shabd kaa istemaal kyon nahin hota he
 The government and the military do not call those who sacrificed their lives a martyr
 yah jawaab aapako loksabhaa kii website se mil jaayenge
 You can take a print out and tweet them
 bharat sarkaar seemaa par jaan dene vaale sainikon ke liye shahid shabd kaa istemaal nahin karti he
 Be cautious about newspapers and TV or else you will be among those who grumble the fleet of this country
 inamen se zyaadaatar kaa kaam hukumat ke liye zindaabad bolnaa ho gaya he
 Gurmehar Kaur has spoken as much as she spoke
 uske virodh main log bole to samarthan main bhi bole hai
 She is a student isse badi baat kya ho sakati he ki pratham varsh kii is chaatra kaa saath uske shikshakon ne diya he
 Teachers in the English Department of Lady Shri Ram College have issued a statement which states, 'we are a faculty member of the English Department of Lady Shri Ram College, clearly and strongly supporting our student Gurmehar Kaur
 uniwarsity se jude muddon par apane vichaaron ko rakhane ke uske adhikaar kaa samarthan karte hai
 It is quite satisfying for us teachers that they have expressed themselves with great sensitivity, creativity and bravery rather than resorting to silence on the environment around them
 hamen lagata he ki shiksha sansthaanon kaa ye kartavya he ki wo apane chaatro ko hinsaatmak badale kii karrwai ke dar se dur unhen samvedansheel or javabdeh banaaen or unamem aalochanatmak chintan kii kshamta viksit karen
 We are proud that Gurmehar has performed his duty as a young citizen of this country
 use mil rahi hinsa or barbarta kii dhamkiyon kii ham ninda karte hai
 Social media responses by public figures such as Virender Sehwag and Randeep Hooda are shameful forms of intimidation and fear that Gurmehar is facing, towards the violent mob that the university has recently witnessed
 ham janata se samajhadaari kii apil karte hai
 We also appeal to those institutions that have the responsibility to restore people's trust in law and justice and provide an environment for our young citizens to think fearlessly and express themselves
 
 
 ' Governments have a lot of power
 ham or aap jab is ghatana ko bhul jaayenge to wo koi tarika nikaalegi
 The teachers supporting Gurmehar Kaur will harass her
 notice bhejegi
 They will get their register checked
 bahut se shikshak na to apane liye bol pate hai na apane chaatr ke liye
 Many teachers marry in this country with dowry and roam on the day of the teacher as deities
 aise shikshakon ke liye main un shikshakon kaa naam pard rahaa hum jinhone gurmeher kaa saath diya he
 Janet Lalwampui, Nangoum Maheshakanta Singh, Maitreyi Mandal, Johnathan Vagchaz, Rachita Mittal, Shernaz Cama, Aarti Minocha, Rukhsana Shroff, Madhu Grover, Wafa Hamid, Rita Joshi, Maya Joshi, Tania Sachdev, Mitali Mishra, Arunima Ray, Dipti Kar Rajeev, Tania Sachdev
 aisi story ke liye taiyaar rahiye ki samarthan karne vaale teacheron ko kaise pareshaan kiya gaya
 What should a teacher do to not support her student, especially when the minister and MP are speaking against her
 twitor par use balaatkaar karne kii dhamkiyaan di ja rahi hon or likhakar gaaliyaan di ja rahi hon
 Suppose your daughter studies there, what should the teacher do
 is lihaaz se ye badi baat he
 The ABVP organized a tricolor tour on its behalf on Monday 
 bijepi netaa shina ensi ne kaha he ki jise bhi pareshaani he use lekar bahes honi chahie
 There should be no place for violence
 abivipi ke netaa saket bahuguna ne morris nagar thane main shikaayat darj karai he
 It has been said that through the media from all over the country and also in TV studios, it has been said that some people are threatening to kill and rape them on social media
 desh ke kisi bhi naagarik ko aisi dhamkiyaan milanaa galat he
 The police should take strong action against such elements
 durbhaagya se gurmeher ji hamaare sanghathan abivipi par aarope laga rahi hai lekin main saaf karnaa chahta hum ki hamaara koi bhi daayitvadharee isamen shaamil nahin he
 As of late, Saket Bahuguna has done a good job
 saket ko kiren rijiju se bhi kahana chahie ki aap gurmeher kaa saath dijie, suraksha kiijie kyonki wo akeli he
 Even though he has opposed us
 phir bhi jitna uske bas main he utana to saket ne kiya hi
 Saket should now look at the pictures in which the people of his organization are shown committing violence
 wo chahen to hinsa karne vaale sadasyon ko nikaal sakate hai
 Even though the violence of the other factions remains in their organization, Saket Bahuguna has a great chance to respond to the opponents and send a message to his organization that we will not commit violence
 ummid he saket bahuguna kii yah baat mantriyon or saansadon tak pahonchegi jo gurmeher ke dimaag ko dooshit karne waalon kaa pataa laga rahe the
 Based on his one year old video, he was challenging his patriotism
 kisi bhi sarkaar kaa numaayinda ladakiyon kii baat ko bhale naapsand kare magar uski samaj yaa swatantra soch ko chunauti nahin de saktaa he
 However, now Gurmehar has made a statement separating himself from further proceedings, 'main campan se khud ko alag kar rahi hum
 Congratulations to all of you
 mujhe akelaa chhod den
 i said what i had to say
 ek cheez jo nishchit he ki ab ham hinsa karne yaa kisi ko dhamkee dene se pehle do baar sochenge, or isliye meraa virodh tha
 This campaign is for students, not for me
 march main badi sankhya main hissaa len jo koi bhi mere saahas or bahaduree par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 i will say to them that i have shown more courage than i have
 ' Gurmehar Kaur has done her work
 unke saath or unke pehle bhi bahut si ladakiyon ne awaz uthaai he
 We asked some young girls how the society around them treats them when they speak, for the first time or they speak again and again
 ve pehle kis dar se khud ko azaad karti hai or jab azaad hoti hai to unka bolnaa kis tarah se or kis kis ko daraa detaa he
 Who are the girls who say that they speak a lot, if you speak, then see, the purpose of today's prime time is to bring the girls who speak in response, so that you can see them
 zarur ladki hone ke kaaran use koi phayda nahin milanaa chahie, uski baat kaa tarkon ke aadhaar virodh hona chahie
 There should be debate, but when someone silences a girl, it should not be right for her to speak, to support her for her courage
 miranda house kii chaatra hani ne ek video hamen bheja he jisamen wo kah rahi hai, 'sabko awaz uthaani chahie, main nahin ham nahin to koun awaz uthayega
 'there is so much instruction for girls, yet someone comes forward to speak
 inaki parivaar waalon se guzarish he ki itnaa bhi na daren
 Siddhi says that whenever girls accompanying her are to speak, they are reminded of safety and kept silent
 wo koun log hai jo ladki ke bolne par khatara ban jate hai
 Resist his point
 asahmat hoiye lekin use yah bolne vaale koun log hote hai jo kehete hai ki thik nahin hoga
 Is such a voice coming from people sitting in a chair
 kahin aap aise logon kaa samarthan to nahin karte jo ladakiyon ke bolne par dekh lene kii baat karte hai
 There is no dearth of such people from society to all governments
 yamini dikshit aisi hi ek chaatra hai jo bolne ke apane anubhav ko aapse saajha karnaa chaahati hai
 Yamini is fighting for a place in the university where any kind of differences can be resolved through dialogue
 ramajas college main jhagade kaise hue, pathar kisne phenke, police kya kar rahi thi, isaki jaanch ho rahi he or kabhi nateeja nahin aayega
 So in prime time our motive is not to go into the reasons or side opposition to that quarrel
 ham gurmeher ko lekar hue vivaad ke sandarbh main dekhne kii koshish kar rahe hai ki jab koi ladki bolti he to uske saath kya kya hota he
 How does she fight herself before speaking, how does the world fight her when she speaks
 ham baat kar rahe hai ki hinsa kaa dar samaapt karne kii zimmedaari jitna abivipi kii he utani hi isa kii he, in donon se sabase adhik javabdehi police or uniwarsity kii he
 We have taken consent from these girls, they have also shown courage that they will speak on the situation of speaking
 duniya main virodh kaa tarika sarkaar nahin tay karegi
 People will decide
 ab dekhiye pradhanmantri ne man kii baat shuru kii
 In response, Congress leader Sandeep Dixit started talking about work
 ve bhi radio ke zariye kaam kii baat main pradhanmantri se sawaal karte hai or internet par daal dete hai
 This is how democracy thrives
 tarah tarah kii awaazen sunai detii hai
 Between these voices, you choose someone as Prime Minister and you do not choose anyone
 miranda house kii aditi kahati hai, 'main kisi sanghathan kii nahin hum
 If someone did not like something, they should have a peaceful demonstration
 unke paas soshal media par bahut se log likhane se darate hai
 They are running away from politics
 yah raajnneeti ke liye acha nahin he
 Why do they think that the gang of abusers will start writing anonymously
 aap gaali dene waalon kii profile check kiijie
 See which political party they are supporters of
 whatsap aajkal soochna ke naam par kachra failaayaa ja rahaa he
 There are rumors of anonymity
 puraa tantra laga hua he kisi ko bheetar bheetar badnaam karne main
 Probably for all these reasons especially ordinary women are afraid to write
 gurmeher ke post par bhi kisi kisi baaten likhi gai hai
 The police has registered a case
 dekhte hai kya hota he
 On Tuesday, a march took place at Delhi University
 is march kaa aayojan chaatr or shikshakon ne kiya tha
 The AISA organization was also involved
 is march main sarvapriya sangwan ne un ladakiyon se baat kii jo kisi sanghathan kii to nahin hai magar hinsa kii raajnneeti ke virodh main ain thim
 Hopefully the college administration will not disturb such speaking girls but will issue a letter to them that you have brightened the name of the college by participating in a peaceful demonstration
 aisa patr college ke principal ko dena chahie
 It should be given to the members of ABVP and also to the people of AISA
 or un chaatro ko bhi jo kisi sanghathan se nahin hai jaise aditi
 Nidikshma Sharma is a student of Ramjas
 wo kahati hai, 'hamane dekha ki kaise hamaari uniwarsity rit place main badal gai
 This thing is meant to be kept
 virodh karnaa zaruri he kyonki wo hamen daraana chaahate hai
 ' soshal media par ham kaisaa samaaj banane de rahe hai jahaan ladakiyon ko bolte vakt sochna pade ki khatara to nahin he
 If you come out of the house then there is danger, stay at home and speak to the world even then there is danger jab jubaan hi nahin bachegi to betiyaan kiske liye bachengi
 Will the statistics department and women's welfare department survive for data
 bahut si ladkiyaan hai jo in gaali dene vaale girohon kaa muqabla kar rahi hai
 His contribution will be remembered in times to come
 gaali dene vaale ek baat yaad rakhen
 Governments and political parties will quit using them
 ve soshal media main chaahe jo likh len, jis bhi netaa kaa naam le len magar samaaj main kabhi nahin bataa sakenge ki ve kisi raajnneetik dal ke samarthan main gaaliyaan likhte hai
 Threaten people
 ek chaatra pranjal ne kaha, 'pehle main is protest main aana nahin chaahati thi kyonki mere parent bahut chintit the
 It is not that they support ABVP, but they are afraid of ABVP not to do anything to me
 pranjal kii tarah hi sarvapriya ko dilli vishvavidhyalay ke march main skool kii ek chaatra mili
 Aditi wo pranjal ke saath hi thi
 Aditi said that fear has become her weapon and it is more important for girls to protest because they are told that you are weak
 tippaniyan Various types of protests are taking place in the world
 bharat main hi haazi ali dargah or shani mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh ko lekar kitna jabardast andolan hua
 Women started this movement
 apane sawaal ke naam par vot lene ke liye nahin balki samaaj ko badalane ke liye
 You remember Nikita Azad
 patiala kii nikita ne akele napkin andolan kii shuruyaat kar di
 Nikita wrote a letter to the trustee of the Sabarimala temple that i am a twenty year old girl, my eyes, ears, nose, lips, hands, feet are all like other human beings
 main ek aurat hum jise maahvaaree hoti he
 i have heard mother say that one should not go to temples at such times
 aurat apavitra hoti he
 This letter from Nikita created uproar in the country in which she asked the Sabarimala people why women are being prevented from coming to the temple during menstruation
 yah sawaal usne akele uthaaya
 Congress did not lift from bjp's platform
 in dalon ke netaaon kii saansen phool jaaengi
 So it is important that someone should raise their voice alone
 jab koi aisa kare to ham saath den
 Also ask a voice person
 nikita se bhi sawaal hue magar use sawaal karne ke liye daraana thik nahin he
 Girls are raising their voices
 inhen akele main yaa bheed main kisi bhi kaaran se maarane waalon ko dhamkaane waalon kaa saath mat dijie
 It may be that the crowd has the right arguments, reasons, but it is not the court
 wo kanoon nahin he
 He does not have the right to decide on the road for the right thing
 yah baat chemistry ke silebus kaa nahin he
 Is in the syllabus of common life
 bina skool gaye samaj main aa sakati he
 The whole history is replete with fresh morale of protest
 har daur main koi virdohi aata he jo us daur ko ek nayaa mukaam detaa he
 Political parties are not the only ones opposing
 sattadhari dal ke log jab virodh karte hai to unhen har tarah kii suvidha hasil hoti he
 The police supports them
 sarkaar saath detii he
 There are some challenges for the opposing party but they also have strength
 yah suvidha tamaam karmchaaree sanghathan, kisaan mazdoor or peshewar sanghathan ko hasil nahin hoti he
 All kinds of organization are required for protest
 har masale par raajnneetik dal ke log virodh nahin karte hai
 For example, if you tell ABVP and NSUI that you will protest against unemployment and expensive education in capitals across the country, then they will start doing Kathak
 kyonki jahaan ve awaz uthaayenge, mumkin he vahaan unki party kii sarkaar ho sakati he
 Go to Jantar Mantar in Delhi
 rajyon kii rajdhani se lekar zila mukhyalayon par jaakar dekhiye
 Under what circumstances are people protesting against their demand? in sabamein uskaa virodh sabase bada hota he jo akele awaz uthaata he
 As long as someone is the only one to raise a voice, there is still hope that there is someone
 yah baat chup rahane vaale yaa dekhakar andekha karne vaale tabhi samajhate hai jab wo kahin sarkaar or samaaj kii hinsa ke shikaar hote hai or kisi netaa yaa reporter ko phone karte hai
 Gurmehar Kaur's opposition was so great that she did not form an organization to speak out
 uskaa virodh isliye bada ho gaya jab uski awaz par centre sarkaar ke mantri ne pratikriya di
 Kiran Rijiju, the Minister of State for Home, should have encouraged Gurmehar Kaur from the rule, but he made a comment against her and turned the entire government against her
 isliye gurmeher cor kaa virodh bada he
 Gurmehar Kaur had protested that she is not afraid of ABVP
 usne akele jab bolaa to soshal media kii kamazor duniya daud padi ki koi to bolaa
 Probably went viral and then Gurmehar Kaur was targeted
 abivipi kii aalochana to sabane kii or abivipi ne bhi dat kar jawaab diya magar ek ladki kaa akele bolne se ki wo abivipi se nahin darati he, isse dar to paidaa hua
 The matter disappeared in a moment and was brought to light by a year-old video, which Gurmehar Kaur had put on youtube on another reference
 ab us video ke sahare us par hamalaa hua
 The Minister of State for Home joined the attack
 bijepi ke saansad ne kaha ki daaud ibrahim ne bhi apane anti neshnal ko sahi tehraane ke liye baap ke sipaahi hone kaa istamaal nahin kiya
 Apparently Gurmehar's loneliness increased and his courage too
 gandhi kaa sabase bada yogadan kya tha
 He freed the common people from the fear that armed with sticks and could resist the British rule, which had been in existence for 200 years
 bina dare
 Whatever comes out of this basic fear, the society and the government get scared
 aap twitor par jaakar dekhiye, gurmeher ke khilaaf kis bhashaa kaa istamaal kiya gaya he
 This is because some girl kept silent after seeing the government police
 bole nahin
 But the girl turned out to be a bit stubborn and said that she is not afraid
 ab usne kaha he ki use jitna awaz uthaanaa tha uthaa liya, ab wo chup rahegi
 What has been said is correct
 wo dari nahin he, usne ab aap par daal diya he ki aap ek akeli ladki ke saath khadey ho sakate hai to khadey hokar dikhaaiye
 There are some Ram sahibs who are against the war between India and Pakistan
 shanti ko protsaahit karte hai
 They put such messages in youtube
 28 april 2016 ko unheen ke liye gurmeher ne hindi or angrezi main ye video daalaa tha
 Gurmehar Kaur is telling in this video that when she was two years old, her father was martyred, when she was six years old, she even tried to kill a burqewali because she thought she was the one responsible for my father's death
 tab uski maa ne samajhaayaa ki pakistan ne nahin mere pita ko jang ne maaraa he
 He wrote that he learned to forget hatred
 yah aasaan nahin tha lekin bahut mushkil bhi nahin
 If i can do it, you can too
 aaj main bhi apane pita kii tarah hi ek sainik hum
 i fight for peace between India and Pakistan because if there had not been a war, my father would have been with me today
 duniya yuddh ke kilaaf bolti he
 Everyone knows that war is the enemy of humanity so that's why leaders from smallpox to big talk talk about peace
 gurmeher ne jab yah video you tub par daalaa to uskaa saath pakistan ke ek noujvaan faiyaaz khan ne diya
 Till now you must have heard the allied country, the enemy country, Fayyaz Khan introduced the idea of a new country with Gurmehar Kaur
 sibling desh yani bhai bahan kaa desh
 This is why we come to life thinking new and beautiful
 australia main rahete hai faiyaaz khan
 On 6 May 2016, this video was uploaded to youtube
 koi ram sahab hai jo bharat pakistan ke bich shanti ko protsaahit karne ke liye you tub par andolan chalaate hai
 In the same video, Fayaz says
 
 
 hai gurmeher cor, main fayaaz khan hum pakistan se
 When i first came to Australia, i used to see all Indians as i was taught in school
 lekin jaldi hi humlog class room main khaanaa, kursiyaan saajha karne lage jaise ham kareebi dost hon
 We all regret the death of your father in the Kargil war
 maine yuddh dekha he, apane shahar swat main mautein dekhi hai lekin kismat se apane ghar ke kisi sadsy ko nahin khoyaa, lekin mere aasapaas hazaron gurmeher cor hai
 i want to come to India without any visa restriction
 ham donon in paabandiyon ke kilaaf mil kar ladenge
 Thousands of people on both sides of the border do not have to go through the hardships like Gurmehar Kaur, we will fight for it
 main tumhen tumhaare pita kaa pyaar to nahin de saktaa, lekin beshak tumhen dushman desh se ek bhai mil gaya he
 Let's create a unique relationship in this world where the brother is a Muslim and the sister a Sikh
 ab is dushman desh shabd ko sibling desh se badal dete hai
 That means, let's do siblings' country
 ye asar hua tha gurmeher ke video kaa
 There are many videos coming against Gurmehar Kaur's video as well
 unki aalochana bhi ho rahi he
 Our focus is on what happens when a single girl speaks
 aap twitor par jaakar gurmeher cor ko di gai gaaliyon ko jamaa kiijie
 In the name of Nari Devi Hai, the society of the gimmick will open
 mul baat kya he, gurmeher cor ne video daalaa ki wo abivipi se nahin darati he
 But to shore it up, a year old video was taken out and presented as if it is shortening the sacrifices of the soldiers killed while fighting against Pakistan
 apane pita kaa istemaal kar rahi he
 The seekers may have found the same video on the same youtube, but they did not spread it to you, because the effort is to keep on cracking in the name of nationalism
 apane andar hinsa kii bhaavana ko mauka dete rahen
 What Gurmehar's post has achieved has not been achieved anywhere in the world even with thousands of missiles
 sibling desh
 Country of siblings
 hamane shahid shabd kaa istemaal nahin kiya
 We do not
 aap puuchhiye ki ham shahid kaa istemaal kyon nahin karte hai, jo jawaab dete hai
 And this answer has been given by the Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju in the Lok Sabha
 22 disambar 2015 ko lalganj kii saansad neelam sonkar ke sawaal ke jawaab main grih rajya mantri ne kaha ki ''raksha mantralay ne suchit kiya he ki 'shahid' shabd bhartiya sashastr senaaon main kinhin cazcelatiz ke sandarbh main prayukt nahin kiya jaataa
 Similarly, such a term is not used to refer to the death of soldiers of Central Armed Police Forces and Assam Rifles during an action or action
 yahi jawaab 18 farvir 2014 ko purv grih rajya mantri arpyen singh ne loksabhaa main diya tha ki sarkaar ne kabhi shahid shabd ko paribhaashit nahin kiya he
 The ABVP should ask Kiren Rijiju why the word martyr is not used for soldiers who die for the country
 sarkaar or sena apni jaan kii qurbaani dene vaale ko shahid nahin kahati he
 You will get this answer from the Lok Sabha website
 aap print out lekar inhen twit kar sakate hai
 The Indian government does not use the word martyr for soldiers who died on the border
 akhbaar or tivi ko lekar satark ho jaaiye varna is desh kaa bedaa gark karne waalon main aap bhi shaamil honge
 Most of these work has become alive for the sake of government
 gurmeher cor ne jitna bol liya tha utana bol liya he
 People have spoken against him and have also spoken in support
 wo ek chaatra he
 What can be bigger than this, that this first year student has been supported by her teachers
 ladi shriram college ke angrezi vibhaag ke teacheron ne ek bayaan jari kiya he jisamen likhaa he, 'ham ladi shriram college ke angrezi vibhaag ke faikalti member saafataur par or majbooti se apni chaatra gurmeher cor kaa samarthan karte hai
 Supports his right to express his views on university-related issues
 ham shikshakon ke liye ye kaafii santoshjanak he ki usne apane aasapaas bane maahaul par chuppi kaa sahaara lene ke bajaay badi hi samvedansheeltaa, rachanaatmakataa or bahaduree ke saath khud ko vyakt kiya he
 We feel that it is the duty of educational institutions to make their students sensitive and accountable and away from the fear of violent revenge action and develop their capacity for critical thinking
 hamen garv he ki gurmeher ne is desh ke ek yuva naagarik ke taur par apana kartavya nibhaayaa he
 We condemn the threats of violence and vandalism she is receiving
 virendra sahvaag or randeep huda jaise public figures dwaara soshal media par die gaye jawaab us dhamkee or dar kaa sharmnaak rup hai jiskaa saamana gurmeher kar rahi hai, us hinsak bheed kii taraf se jiskaa rup uniwarsity ne haal hi main dekha
 We appeal to the public for understanding
 ham un sansthaanon se bhi samajhadaari kii apil karte hai jinke haath main ye zimmedaari he ki wo kaanoon or nyaay main logon kaa bharosa behaal karen or hamaare yuva nagarikon ke liye bina dare sochane or khud ko vyakt karne kaa maahaul den
 
 
 ' sarkaron ke paas takat bahut hoti he
 When we and you forget this incident, it will find a way out
 gurmeher cor kaa samarthan dene vaale shikshakon ko pareshaan karegi
 Will send notice unke register check karavaaegi
 Many teachers neither speak for themselves nor for their students
 bahut se shikshak is desh main dahez lekar shaadi karte hai or shikshak diwas ke din devtaa banakar ghoomte hai
 For such teachers, i am reading the names of those teachers who have supported Gurmehar
 janet lalwampui, nangoum maheshakanta singh, maitreyi mandal, jonthan vagchz, rachita mittal, shernaz kama, aarti minocha, ruyeesana shrauf, madhu grover, vafaa hamid, reeta joshi, maaya joshi, tania sachdev, mitali mishra, arunima re, dipti nath, karunaa rajeev, tania sachdev
 Be prepared for a story of how the supporting teachers were harassed
 ek teacher ko apni chaatra kaa saath nahin dena chahie to kya karnaa chahie, khaskar tab jab uske kilaaf mantri or saansad bol rahe hon
 On Twitter, he is being threatened with rape and abuses in writing
 maan lijie ki aapaki beti vahaan padhati ho to teacher ko kya karnaa chahie
 In this sense, it is a big deal
 abivipi ne somvaar ko apni taraf se tirangaa yatra kaa aayojan kiya tha
 BJP leader Shaina NC has said that there should be a debate on whoever is in trouble
 hinsa kii koi jagah nahin honi chahie
 ABVP leader Saket Bahuguna has filed a complaint at the Morris Nagar police station
 kaha he ki media ke madhyam se puure desh se or mujhase bhi tivi studio main ye baat kahi he ki kuch log unhen soshal media par jaan se maarane or balaatkaar kii dhamkee de rahe hai
 It is wrong for any citizen of the country to receive such threats
 police ko aise tatwon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kerani chahie
 Unfortunately Gurmehar ji is blaming our organization ABVP but i want to make it clear that none of our liabilities are involved in this
 der se hi sahi, saket bahuguna ne acha kaam kiya he
 Saket should also tell Kiren Rijiju that you should support Gurmehar, protect because she is alone
 bhale hi usne hamaara virodh kiya he
 Still, Saket did as much as he has
 saket ko ab un tasveeron ko dekhnaa chahie jisamen uske sanghathan ke log hinsa karte dikhaaye gaye hai
 If they want, they can remove the members who commit violence
 bhale hi duusare gut ke hinsa karne vaale apane sanghathan main bane rahen magar saket bahuguna ke paas ek shandaar mauka he virodhiyon ko jawaab dene kaa or apane sanghathan ko sandesh dene kaa ki ham hinsa nahin karenge
 It is expected that this talk of Saket Bahuguna will reach the ministers and mps who were looking for those who corrupted Gurmehar's mind
 uske ek saal puraane video ke aadhaar par uski deshbhakti yaa samadh ko chunauti de rahe the
 The representative of any government may dislike the talk of the girls but cannot challenge their understanding or independent thinking
 baharhaal ab gurmeher ne khud ko aage kii kaarywahi se alag karte hue bayaan diya he ki, 'I am separating myself from the campaign
 aap sabhi ko badhai
 Leave me alone mujhe jo kahana tha wo maine kah diya
 One thing that is certain is that now we will think twice before committing violence or threatening someone, and so i was opposed
 ye campan chaatro ke liye he, mere liye nahin
 Participate in large numbers in March, whoever is questioning my courage and bravery
 unke liye kahuungi ki maine zarurat se zyaada himmat dikhaai he
 ' gurmeher cor ne apana kaam kar diya he
 Many girls have voiced with them and even before them
 hamane kuch noujvaan ladakiyon se poocha ki jab wo bolti hai, pehali baar bolti hai yaa baar baar bolti hai to unke aas paas kaa samaaj unke saath kis tarah kaa bartaav karata he
 With what fear does she first liberate herself, and when she is free, how can she speak and which scares someone
 koun hai jo ladakiyon ke bolne par kehete hai ki bahut bolti ho, bologi to dekh lenaa, aaj ke prime time kaa makasad iske jawaab main un ladakiyon ko samaane laana he jo bolti hai, taaki aap unhen dekh saken
 Surely she should not get any benefit due to being a girl, her talk should be opposed on the basis of arguments
 bahes honi chahie lekin jab koi kisi ladki ko chup karaaye to uski baat ke liye na sahi, uski himmat ke liye uskaa saath dena chahie
 Honey, a student of Miranda House, has sent us a video in which she is saying, 'everyone should raise their voice, not me or who will raise their voice
 ' ladakiyon ke liye kitni hidaayat hoti he phir bhi koi na koi aage aati he bolne ke liye
 His family is requested not to be afraid too much
 siddhi kahati hai ki jab bhi unke saath kii ladkiyaan bolne ko hoti hai unhen suraksha kii yaad dilaakar chup kara diya jaataa he
 Who are those people who become a threat when a girl speaks? uski baat kaa virodh kiijie
 Disagree but who are the people who say it, that they say will not be okay
 kya aisi awaz kursi par baithe logon se bhi aa rahi he
 Somewhere you do not support such people who talk about seeing girls when they speak
 samaaj se lekar tamaam sarkaron main aise logon kii kami nahin hai
 Yamini Dixit is one such student who wants to share her speaking experience with you
 yamini uniwarsity main ek aisi jagah ke liye lard rahi he jahaan kisi bhi tarah kaa matbhed baatcheet ke zariye suljhaayaa ja sake
 How the fights took place in Ramjas College, who threw stones, what the police were doing, it is being investigated and there will never be a result
 isliye prime time main hamaara makasad us jhagade ke kaarnon yaa paksh vipaksh main janaa nahin he
 We are trying to see in the context of the controversy over Gurmehar what happens to a girl when she speaks
 wo bolne se pehle khud se kaise ladati he, jab wo bolti he to usase duniya kaise ladati he
 We are talking that the responsibility of ending the fear of violence is as much as abvp's responsibility to AISA, the police and university have the most accountability for both of them
 hamane in ladakiyon se sahmati lee he, unhone bhi himmat dikhaai he ki ve bolne ke halaat par bolengi
 The government will not decide the way of protest in the world
 log tay karenge
 Now see, the Prime Minister started Mann Ki Baat
 iske jawaab main congress ke netaa sandip dikshit ne kaam kii baat shuru kar di
 They also question the Prime Minister about the work through radio and put it on the Internet
 is tarah se loktantr faltaa phulata he
 Different sounds are heard
 in awaazon ke bich hi aap kisi ko pradhanmantri chunate hai or kisi ko nahin chunate hai
 Aditi from Miranda House says, 'I don't belong to any organization
 agar kisi ko kuch pasand nahin tha to unhen shantipurna pradarshan karnaa chahie
 He has many people afraid to write on social media
 ve raajnneeti se bhaagane lage hai
 This is not good for politics
 unhen kyon lagata he ki gaali dene waalon kaa giroh anaap shanaap likhane lagegaa
 Check the profile of your abuser
 dekhiye ki ve kis raajnneetik dal ke samarthak hai
 whatsapp is being spread in the name of information nowadays
 anaap shanaap afvaahen hai
 The whole system is engaged in defaming someone inside
 shaayad inhen sab vajahon se khaskar aam mahilaayein likhane se ghabraati hai
 What kind of things have been written on Gurmehar's post too
 police ne maamla to darj kiya he
 Let's see what happens
 mangalvaar ko dilli vishvavidhyalay main ek march hua
 This march was organized by students and teachers
 isa sanghathan bhi shaamil tha
 In this March, Sarvapriya Sangwan spoke to girls who are not from any organization but came against the politics of violence
 ummid he ki college prashasan aisi bolne vaali ladakiyon ko pareshaan nahin karegaa balki unhen ek patr jari karegaa ki aapane shantipurna pradarshan main hissaa lekar college kaa naam raushan kiya he
 Such a letter should be given to the principal of the college
 abivipi ke sadasyon ko bhi dena chahie or isa waalon ko bhi
 And also those students who are not from any organization like Aditi
 nidikshma sharma ramajas kii chaatra hai
 She says, 'we saw how our university turned into Riot Place
 ye baat rakhane ke liye hoti he
 It is important to protest because they want to scare us
 ' What kind of society are we letting on social media where girls have to think while speaking that there is danger? ghar se niklo to khatara, ghar main rahakar duniya se bolo tab bhi khatara
 When the tongue is not left, the daughters will save for whom
 kya sankhyikee vibhaag or mahila kalyaan vibhaag ke aankadon ke liye bachengi
 There are many girls who are combating these abusive gangs
 aane vaale vakt main unka yogadan yaad kiya jayega
 Remember one thing that abuses
 sarkarein or raajnneetik dal unka istemaal kar chhod denge
 Whatever they write on social media, they can take the name of any leader but in society they will never be able to tell that they write abuses in support of any political party
 logon ko dhamkaate hai
 Pranjal, a student, said, 'at first i did not want to come to this Protest because my parents were very worried
 aisa nahin he ki wo abivipi ko saport karte hai, lekin wo abivipi se darate hai ki kahin wo mujhe kuch na kar den
 Like Pranjal, Sarvapriya got a school student in Delhi University in March
 aditi
 She was with Pranjal
 aditi ne kaha ki dar unka hathiyaar ho gaya he or ladakiyon ke liye virodh karnaa zyaada zaruri he kyonki unhen bolaa jaataa he ki tum kamazor ho
 The comments duniya main tarah tarah ke virodh pradarshan ho rahe hai
 What a tremendous movement in India for the entry of women into the Haji Ali Dargah and the Shani Temple
 mahilaon ne yah andolan chalaaya
 Not to take votes in the name of your question but to change the society
 aapako nikita azaad yaad he
 Nikita of Patiala started the napkin movement alone
 nikita ne sabarimala mandir ke trustee ko patr likh diya ki main bees saal kii ladki hum, mere aankh, kaan, naak, hont, haath, paanv sab hai jaise duusare insaanon ke hai
 i am a woman who has menstruation
 maine maa ko kehete suna he ki aise samay main mandiron main nahin janaa chahie
 a woman is impure
 nikita ke is patr ne desh main hangaamaa machaa diya jisamen usne sabarimala waalon se poocha tha ki maahvaaree ke samay auraton ko mandir aane se kyon roka ja rahaa he
 He raised this question alone
 congress bijepi ke manch se nahin uthaaya
 The breath of the leaders of these parties will swell
 isliye zaruri he ki koi akele bhi awaz uthaae
 When someone does this, then we support
 awaz uthaane vaale se sawaal bhi karen
 Nikita was also questioned but it is not right to scare her
 ladkiyaan awaz uthaa rahi hai
 Do not support those who kill them in private or in the crowd for any reason
 ho saktaa he ki bheed ke paas sabase sahi tark hon, kaaran hon magar wo adaalat nahin he
 That is not the law
 sahi baat ke liye sadak par faisla karne kaa adhikaar uske paas nahin he
 This is not the case with the syllabus of chemistry
 aam zindagi ke silebus main he
 Can understand without going to school
 in sabamein uskaa virodh sabase bada hota he jo akele awaz uthaata he
 As long as someone is the only one to raise a voice, there is still hope that there is someone
 yah baat chup rahane vaale yaa dekhakar andekha karne vaale tabhi samajhate hai jab wo kahin sarkaar or samaaj kii hinsa ke shikaar hote hai or kisi netaa yaa reporter ko phone karte hai
 Gurmehar Kaur's opposition was so great that she did not form an organization to speak out
 uskaa virodh isliye bada ho gaya jab uski awaz par centre sarkaar ke mantri ne pratikriya di
 Kiran Rijiju, the Minister of State for Home, should have encouraged Gurmehar Kaur from the rule, but he made a comment against her and turned the entire government against her
 isliye gurmeher cor kaa virodh bada he
 Gurmehar Kaur had protested that she is not afraid of ABVP
 usne akele jab bolaa to soshal media kii kamazor duniya daud padi ki koi to bolaa
 Probably went viral and then Gurmehar Kaur was targeted
 abivipi kii aalochana to sabane kii or abivipi ne bhi dat kar jawaab diya magar ek ladki kaa akele bolne se ki wo abivipi se nahin darati he, isse dar to paidaa hua
 The matter disappeared in a moment and was brought to light by a year-old video, which Gurmehar Kaur had put on youtube on another reference
 ab us video ke sahare us par hamalaa hua
 The Minister of State for Home joined the attack
 bijepi ke saansad ne kaha ki daaud ibrahim ne bhi apane anti neshnal ko sahi tehraane ke liye baap ke sipaahi hone kaa istamaal nahin kiya
 Apparently Gurmehar's loneliness increased and his courage too
 gandhi kaa sabase bada yogadan kya tha
 He freed the common people from the fear that armed with sticks and could resist the British rule, which had been in existence for 200 years
 bina dare
 Whatever comes out of this basic fear, the society and the government get scared
 aap twitor par jaakar dekhiye, gurmeher ke khilaaf kis bhashaa kaa istamaal kiya gaya he
 This is because some girl kept silent after seeing the government police
 bole nahin
 But the girl turned out to be a bit stubborn and said that she is not afraid
 ab usne kaha he ki use jitna awaz uthaanaa tha uthaa liya, ab wo chup rahegi
 What has been said is correct
 wo dari nahin he, usne ab aap par daal diya he ki aap ek akeli ladki ke saath khadey ho sakate hai to khadey hokar dikhaaiye
 There are some Ram sahibs who are against the war between India and Pakistan
 shanti ko protsaahit karte hai
 They put such messages in youtube
 28 april 2016 ko unheen ke liye gurmeher ne hindi or angrezi main ye video daalaa tha
 Gurmehar Kaur is telling in this video that when she was two years old, her father was martyred, when she was six years old, she even tried to kill a burqewali because she thought she was the one responsible for my father's death
 tab uski maa ne samajhaayaa ki pakistan ne nahin mere pita ko jang ne maaraa he
 He wrote that he learned to forget hatred
 yah aasaan nahin tha lekin bahut mushkil bhi nahin
 If i can do it, you can too
 aaj main bhi apane pita kii tarah hi ek sainik hum
 i fight for peace between India and Pakistan because if there had not been a war, my father would have been with me today
 duniya yuddh ke kilaaf bolti he
 Everyone knows that war is the enemy of humanity so that's why leaders from smallpox to big talk talk about peace
 gurmeher ne jab yah video you tub par daalaa to uskaa saath pakistan ke ek noujvaan faiyaaz khan ne diya
 Till now you must have heard the allied country, the enemy country, Fayyaz Khan introduced the idea of a new country with Gurmehar Kaur
 sibling desh yani bhai bahan kaa desh
 This is why we come to life thinking new and beautiful
 australia main rahete hai faiyaaz khan
 On 6 May 2016, this video was uploaded to youtube
 koi ram sahab hai jo bharat pakistan ke bich shanti ko protsaahit karne ke liye you tub par andolan chalaate hai
 In the same video, Fayaz says
 
 
 hai gurmeher cor, main fayaaz khan hum pakistan se
 When i first came to Australia, i used to see all Indians as i was taught in school
 lekin jaldi hi humlog class room main khaanaa, kursiyaan saajha karne lage jaise ham kareebi dost hon
 We all regret the death of your father in the Kargil war
 maine yuddh dekha he, apane shahar swat main mautein dekhi hai lekin kismat se apane ghar ke kisi sadsy ko nahin khoyaa, lekin mere aasapaas hazaron gurmeher cor hai
 i want to come to India without any visa restriction
 ham donon in paabandiyon ke kilaaf mil kar ladenge
 Thousands of people on both sides of the border do not have to go through the hardships like Gurmehar Kaur, we will fight for it
 main tumhen tumhaare pita kaa pyaar to nahin de saktaa, lekin beshak tumhen dushman desh se ek bhai mil gaya he
 Let's create a unique relationship in this world where the brother is a Muslim and the sister a Sikh
 ab is dushman desh shabd ko sibling desh se badal dete hai
 That means, let's do siblings' country
 ye asar hua tha gurmeher ke video kaa
 There are many videos coming against Gurmehar Kaur's video as well
 unki aalochana bhi ho rahi he
 Our focus is on what happens when a single girl speaks
 aap twitor par jaakar gurmeher cor ko di gai gaaliyon ko jamaa kiijie
 In the name of Nari Devi Hai, the society of the gimmick will open
 mul baat kya he, gurmeher cor ne video daalaa ki wo abivipi se nahin darati he
 But to shore it up, a year old video was taken out and presented as if it is shortening the sacrifices of the soldiers killed while fighting against Pakistan
 apane pita kaa istemaal kar rahi he
 The seekers may have found the same video on the same youtube, but they did not spread it to you, because the effort is to keep on cracking in the name of nationalism
 apane andar hinsa kii bhaavana ko mauka dete rahen
 What Gurmehar's post has achieved has not been achieved anywhere in the world even with thousands of missiles
 sibling desh
 Country of siblings
 hamane shahid shabd kaa istemaal nahin kiya
 We do not
 aap puuchhiye ki ham shahid kaa istemaal kyon nahin karte hai, jo jawaab dete hai
 And this answer has been given by the Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju in the Lok Sabha
 22 disambar 2015 ko lalganj kii saansad neelam sonkar ke sawaal ke jawaab main grih rajya mantri ne kaha ki ''raksha mantralay ne suchit kiya he ki 'shahid' shabd bhartiya sashastr senaaon main kinhin cazcelatiz ke sandarbh main prayukt nahin kiya jaataa
 Similarly, such a term is not used to refer to the death of soldiers of Central Armed Police Forces and Assam Rifles during an action or action
 yahi jawaab 18 farvir 2014 ko purv grih rajya mantri arpyen singh ne loksabhaa main diya tha ki sarkaar ne kabhi shahid shabd ko paribhaashit nahin kiya he
 The ABVP should ask Kiren Rijiju why the word martyr is not used for soldiers who die for the country
 sarkaar or sena apni jaan kii qurbaani dene vaale ko shahid nahin kahati he
 You will get this answer from the Lok Sabha website
 aap print out lekar inhen twit kar sakate hai
 The Indian government does not use the word martyr for soldiers who died on the border
 akhbaar or tivi ko lekar satark ho jaaiye varna is desh kaa bedaa gark karne waalon main aap bhi shaamil honge
 Most of these work has become alive for the sake of government
 gurmeher cor ne jitna bol liya tha utana bol liya he
 People have spoken against him and have also spoken in support
 wo ek chaatra he
 What can be bigger than this, that this first year student has been supported by her teachers
 ladi shriram college ke angrezi vibhaag ke teacheron ne ek bayaan jari kiya he jisamen likhaa he, 'ham ladi shriram college ke angrezi vibhaag ke faikalti member saafataur par or majbooti se apni chaatra gurmeher cor kaa samarthan karte hai
 Supports his right to express his views on university-related issues
 ham shikshakon ke liye ye kaafii santoshjanak he ki usne apane aasapaas bane maahaul par chuppi kaa sahaara lene ke bajaay badi hi samvedansheeltaa, rachanaatmakataa or bahaduree ke saath khud ko vyakt kiya he
 We feel that it is the duty of educational institutions to make their students sensitive and accountable and away from the fear of violent revenge action and develop their capacity for critical thinking
 hamen garv he ki gurmeher ne is desh ke ek yuva naagarik ke taur par apana kartavya nibhaayaa he
 We condemn the threats of violence and vandalism she is receiving
 virendra sahvaag or randeep huda jaise public figures dwaara soshal media par die gaye jawaab us dhamkee or dar kaa sharmnaak rup hai jiskaa saamana gurmeher kar rahi hai, us hinsak bheed kii taraf se jiskaa rup uniwarsity ne haal hi main dekha
 We appeal to the public for understanding
 ham un sansthaanon se bhi samajhadaari kii apil karte hai jinke haath main ye zimmedaari he ki wo kaanoon or nyaay main logon kaa bharosa behaal karen or hamaare yuva nagarikon ke liye bina dare sochane or khud ko vyakt karne kaa maahaul den
 
 
 ' sarkaron ke paas takat bahut hoti he
 When we and you forget this incident, it will find a way out
 gurmeher cor kaa samarthan dene vaale shikshakon ko pareshaan karegi
 Will send notice unke register check karavaaegi
 Many teachers neither speak for themselves nor for their students
 bahut se shikshak is desh main dahez lekar shaadi karte hai or shikshak diwas ke din devtaa banakar ghoomte hai
 For such teachers, i am reading the names of those teachers who have supported Gurmehar
 janet lalwampui, nangoum maheshakanta singh, maitreyi mandal, jonthan vagchz, rachita mittal, shernaz kama, aarti minocha, ruyeesana shrauf, madhu grover, vafaa hamid, reeta joshi, maaya joshi, tania sachdev, mitali mishra, arunima re, dipti nath, karunaa rajeev, tania sachdev
 Be prepared for a story of how the supporting teachers were harassed
 ek teacher ko apni chaatra kaa saath nahin dena chahie to kya karnaa chahie, khaskar tab jab uske kilaaf mantri or saansad bol rahe hon
 On Twitter, he is being threatened with rape and abuses in writing
 maan lijie ki aapaki beti vahaan padhati ho to teacher ko kya karnaa chahie
 In this sense, it is a big deal
 abivipi ne somvaar ko apni taraf se tirangaa yatra kaa aayojan kiya tha
 BJP leader Shaina NC has said that there should be a debate on whoever is in trouble
 hinsa kii koi jagah nahin honi chahie
 ABVP leader Saket Bahuguna has filed a complaint at the Morris Nagar police station
 kaha he ki media ke madhyam se puure desh se or mujhase bhi tivi studio main ye baat kahi he ki kuch log unhen soshal media par jaan se maarane or balaatkaar kii dhamkee de rahe hai
 It is wrong for any citizen of the country to receive such threats
 police ko aise tatwon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kerani chahie
 Unfortunately Gurmehar ji is blaming our organization ABVP but i want to make it clear that none of our liabilities are involved in this
 der se hi sahi, saket bahuguna ne acha kaam kiya he
 Saket should also tell Kiren Rijiju that you should support Gurmehar, protect because she is alone
 bhale hi usne hamaara virodh kiya he
 Still, Saket did as much as he has
 saket ko ab un tasveeron ko dekhnaa chahie jisamen uske sanghathan ke log hinsa karte dikhaaye gaye hai
 If they want, they can remove the members who commit violence
 bhale hi duusare gut ke hinsa karne vaale apane sanghathan main bane rahen magar saket bahuguna ke paas ek shandaar mauka he virodhiyon ko jawaab dene kaa or apane sanghathan ko sandesh dene kaa ki ham hinsa nahin karenge
 It is expected that this talk of Saket Bahuguna will reach the ministers and mps who were looking for those who corrupted Gurmehar's mind
 uske ek saal puraane video ke aadhaar par uski deshbhakti yaa samadh ko chunauti de rahe the
 The representative of any government may dislike the talk of the girls but cannot challenge their understanding or independent thinking
 baharhaal ab gurmeher ne khud ko aage kii kaarywahi se alag karte hue bayaan diya he ki, 'I am separating myself from the campaign
 aap sabhi ko badhai
 Leave me alone mujhe jo kahana tha wo maine kah diya
 One thing that is certain is that now we will think twice before committing violence or threatening someone, and so i was opposed
 ye campan chaatro ke liye he, mere liye nahin
 Participate in large numbers in March, whoever is questioning my courage and bravery
 unke liye kahuungi ki maine zarurat se zyaada himmat dikhaai he
 ' gurmeher cor ne apana kaam kar diya he
 Many girls have voiced with them and even before them
 hamane kuch noujvaan ladakiyon se poocha ki jab wo bolti hai, pehali baar bolti hai yaa baar baar bolti hai to unke aas paas kaa samaaj unke saath kis tarah kaa bartaav karata he
 With what fear does she first liberate herself, and when she is free, how can she speak and which scares someone
 koun hai jo ladakiyon ke bolne par kehete hai ki bahut bolti ho, bologi to dekh lenaa, aaj ke prime time kaa makasad iske jawaab main un ladakiyon ko samaane laana he jo bolti hai, taaki aap unhen dekh saken
 Surely she should not get any benefit due to being a girl, her talk should be opposed on the basis of arguments
 bahes honi chahie lekin jab koi kisi ladki ko chup karaaye to uski baat ke liye na sahi, uski himmat ke liye uskaa saath dena chahie
 Honey, a student of Miranda House, has sent us a video in which she is saying, 'everyone should raise their voice, not me or who will raise their voice
 ' ladakiyon ke liye kitni hidaayat hoti he phir bhi koi na koi aage aati he bolne ke liye
 His family is requested not to be afraid too much
 siddhi kahati hai ki jab bhi unke saath kii ladkiyaan bolne ko hoti hai unhen suraksha kii yaad dilaakar chup kara diya jaataa he
 Who are those people who become a threat when a girl speaks? uski baat kaa virodh kiijie
 Disagree but who are the people who say it, that they say will not be okay
 kya aisi awaz kursi par baithe logon se bhi aa rahi he
 Somewhere you do not support such people who talk about seeing girls when they speak
 samaaj se lekar tamaam sarkaron main aise logon kii kami nahin hai
 Yamini Dixit is one such student who wants to share her speaking experience with you
 yamini uniwarsity main ek aisi jagah ke liye lard rahi he jahaan kisi bhi tarah kaa matbhed baatcheet ke zariye suljhaayaa ja sake
 How the fights took place in Ramjas College, who threw stones, what the police were doing, it is being investigated and there will never be a result
 isliye prime time main hamaara makasad us jhagade ke kaarnon yaa paksh vipaksh main janaa nahin he
 We are trying to see in the context of the controversy over Gurmehar what happens to a girl when she speaks
 wo bolne se pehle khud se kaise ladati he, jab wo bolti he to usase duniya kaise ladati he
 We are talking that the responsibility of ending the fear of violence is as much as abvp's responsibility to AISA, the police and university have the most accountability for both of them
 hamane in ladakiyon se sahmati lee he, unhone bhi himmat dikhaai he ki ve bolne ke halaat par bolengi
 The government will not decide the way of protest in the world
 log tay karenge
 Now see, the Prime Minister started Mann Ki Baat
 iske jawaab main congress ke netaa sandip dikshit ne kaam kii baat shuru kar di
 They also question the Prime Minister about the work through radio and put it on the Internet
 is tarah se loktantr faltaa phulata he
 Different sounds are heard
 in awaazon ke bich hi aap kisi ko pradhanmantri chunate hai or kisi ko nahin chunate hai
 Aditi from Miranda House says, 'I don't belong to any organization
 agar kisi ko kuch pasand nahin tha to unhen shantipurna pradarshan karnaa chahie
 He has many people afraid to write on social media
 ve raajnneeti se bhaagane lage hai
 This is not good for politics
 unhen kyon lagata he ki gaali dene waalon kaa giroh anaap shanaap likhane lagegaa
 Check the profile of your abuser
 dekhiye ki ve kis raajnneetik dal ke samarthak hai
 whatsapp is being spread in the name of information nowadays
 anaap shanaap afvaahen hai
 The whole system is engaged in defaming someone inside
 shaayad inhen sab vajahon se khaskar aam mahilaayein likhane se ghabraati hai
 What kind of things have been written on Gurmehar's post too
 police ne maamla to darj kiya he
 Let's see what happens
 mangalvaar ko dilli vishvavidhyalay main ek march hua
 This march was organized by students and teachers
 isa sanghathan bhi shaamil tha
 In this March, Sarvapriya Sangwan spoke to girls who are not from any organization but came against the politics of violence
 ummid he ki college prashasan aisi bolne vaali ladakiyon ko pareshaan nahin karegaa balki unhen ek patr jari karegaa ki aapane shantipurna pradarshan main hissaa lekar college kaa naam raushan kiya he
 Such a letter should be given to the principal of the college
 abivipi ke sadasyon ko bhi dena chahie or isa waalon ko bhi
 And also those students who are not from any organization like Aditi
 nidikshma sharma ramajas kii chaatra hai
 She says, 'we saw how our university turned into Riot Place
 ye baat rakhane ke liye hoti he
 It is important to protest because they want to scare us
 ' What kind of society are we letting on social media where girls have to think while speaking that there is danger? ghar se niklo to khatara, ghar main rahakar duniya se bolo tab bhi khatara
 When the tongue is not left, the daughters will save for whom
 kya sankhyikee vibhaag or mahila kalyaan vibhaag ke aankadon ke liye bachengi
 There are many girls who are combating these abusive gangs
 aane vaale vakt main unka yogadan yaad kiya jayega
 Remember one thing that abuses
 sarkarein or raajnneetik dal unka istemaal kar chhod denge
 Whatever they write on social media, they can take the name of any leader but in society they will never be able to tell that they write abuses in support of any political party
 logon ko dhamkaate hai
 Pranjal, a student, said, 'at first i did not want to come to this Protest because my parents were very worried
 aisa nahin he ki wo abivipi ko saport karte hai, lekin wo abivipi se darate hai ki kahin wo mujhe kuch na kar den
 Like Pranjal, Sarvapriya got a school student in Delhi University in March
 aditi
 She was with Pranjal
 aditi ne kaha ki dar unka hathiyaar ho gaya he or ladakiyon ke liye virodh karnaa zyaada zaruri he kyonki unhen bolaa jaataa he ki tum kamazor ho
 The comments duniya main tarah tarah ke virodh pradarshan ho rahe hai
 What a tremendous movement in India for the entry of women into the Haji Ali Dargah and the Shani Temple
 mahilaon ne yah andolan chalaaya
 Not to take votes in the name of your question but to change the society
 aapako nikita azaad yaad he
 Nikita of Patiala started the napkin movement alone
 nikita ne sabarimala mandir ke trustee ko patr likh diya ki main bees saal kii ladki hum, mere aankh, kaan, naak, hont, haath, paanv sab hai jaise duusare insaanon ke hai
 i am a woman who has menstruation
 maine maa ko kehete suna he ki aise samay main mandiron main nahin janaa chahie
 a woman is impure
 nikita ke is patr ne desh main hangaamaa machaa diya jisamen usne sabarimala waalon se poocha tha ki maahvaaree ke samay auraton ko mandir aane se kyon roka ja rahaa he
 He raised this question alone
 congress bijepi ke manch se nahin uthaaya
 The breath of the leaders of these parties will swell
 isliye zaruri he ki koi akele bhi awaz uthaae
 When someone does this, then we support
 awaz uthaane vaale se sawaal bhi karen
 Nikita was also questioned but it is not right to scare her
 ladkiyaan awaz uthaa rahi hai
 Do not support those who kill them in private or in the crowd for any reason
 ho saktaa he ki bheed ke paas sabase sahi tark hon, kaaran hon magar wo adaalat nahin he
 That is not the law
 sahi baat ke liye sadak par faisla karne kaa adhikaar uske paas nahin he
 This is not the case with the syllabus of chemistry
 aam zindagi ke silebus main he
 Can understand without going to school
 gurmeher cor ne virodh to jataayaa tha ki wo abivipi se nahin darati hai
 When she spoke alone, the weak world of social media ran that someone spoke
 shaayad viral hua or phir gurmeher cor ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 Everyone criticized the ABVP and the ABVP also responded, but a girl was afraid to speak alone that she is not afraid of ABVP
 is baat ko pal bhar main gaayab kar diya gaya or saamne laayaa gaya ek saal purana video, jise gurmeher cor ne kisi or sandarbh main you-tub par daalaa tha
 Now he was attacked with the help of that video
 is hamale main grih rajya mantri tak shaamil ho gaye
 The BJP MP said that Dawood Ibrahim also did not use the father's soldier to justify his anti-national
 zaahir he gurmeher kaa akelaapan or bad gaya or uskaa saahas bhi
 What was Gandhi's biggest contribution? unhone aam se aam logon ko is dar se azaad kar diya ki bina lathi ke banduukon se las or 200 saal se jami british hukumat kaa virodh kar sakate hai
 Without fear
 is buniyadi dar se jo bhi azaad karaane nikalataa he, samaaj or sarkaar ko dar lag jaataa he
 You go to Twitter and see what language has been used against Gurmehar
 ye isliye ki koi ladki sarkaar police dekh kar chup rahe
 Did not say
 magar ladki thodi ziddi nikali kah diya ki darati nahin he
 Now she has said that she has lifted her voice, now she will be silent
 baat sahi bhi he
 She is not scared, she has now put it on you that if you can stand with a single girl then show up
 koi ram sahab hai jo bharat or pakistan ke bich yuddh ke khilaaf hai
 Encourage peace
 vahi you tub main aise sandesh daalate hai
 On 28 April 2016, Gurmehar had posted this video in Hindi and English for him
 gurmeher cor is video main bataa rahi hai ki jab wo do saal kii thi to uske pita shahid ho gaye, chah saal kii thi to ek burkevali ko maarane kaa bhi prayaas kiya kyonki use lagata tha ki mere pita kii maut kii zimmedaar vahi he
 His mother then explained that my father was killed by war, not by Pakistan
 usne yahi likhaa ki nafrat ko bhoolanaa sikh liya
 It was not easy but not too difficult
 agar main aisa kar sakati hum to aap bhi kar sakate hai
 Today i am a soldier just like my father
 main bharat or pakistan ke bich shanti ke liye ladati hum kyonki agar yuddh nahin hua hota to mere pita aaj mere paas hote
 The world speaks against war
 sabko pataa he ki yuddh insaaniyat kaa dushman he isliye chhutbhaiya se lekar bade netaa shanti kii baat karte hai
 When Gurmehar put this video on youtube, a young Pakistani man Faiyaz Khan supported him
 abhi tak aapane mitra desh suna hoga, shatru desh suna hoga, faiyaaz khan ne gurmeher cor ke saath ek nae desh kii kalpana pesh kii
 Sibling country means siblings' country
 ham zindagi main isliye aate hai nayaa or kuubasurat sochane
 Fayyaz Khan lives in Australia
 6 may 2016 ko ye video you tub par daalaa
 There is some Ram sahib who runs a movement on You Tube to encourage peace between India and Pakistan
 usee video main faiyaz kehete hai
 
 
 Hi Gurmehar Kaur, i am Fayaz Khan from Pakistan
 jab main pehali baar australia aayaa to sabhi bharatiyon ko vaise dekhtaa tha jaise mujhe skool main sikhaaya gaya tha
 But soon we started eating in the class room, sharing chairs as if we were close friends
 kargil yuddh main tumhaare pita kii maut par ham sabhi ko afsos he
 i have seen war, have seen deaths in my hometown of Swat but have not lost any member of my house by luck, but i have thousands of Gurmehar Kaur around me
 main bharat aana chahta hum bina kisi viza kii pabandi kii
 We will fight together against these restrictions
 seemaa ke donon taraf hazaron logon ko gurmeher cor kii tarah takalifon se guzaranaa na pade, ham iske liye ladenge
 i cannot give you the love of your father, but of course you have got a brother from the enemy country
 chalo is duniya main ek anokhaa rishta banaate hai jahaan bhai ek musalmaan he or bahan ek sikh
 Now this enemy country replaces the word with Sibling country
 matlab bhai bahan kaa desh kar dete hai
 This effect was from Gurmehar's video
 gurmeher cor ke video ke khilaaf bhi kai video aa rahe hai
 He is also being criticized
 hamaara focus is baat par he jab koi akeli ladki bolti he to kya hota he
 Go to Twitter and submit the abuses given to Gurmehar Kaur
 nari devi he ke naam par nautanki karne vaale samaaj kii pole khul jaaegi
 What is the point, Gurmehar Kaur posted the video that she is not afraid of ABVP
 magar use kinare karne ke liye ek saal purana video nikaala gaya or is tarah pesh kiya gaya jaise wo pakistan ke khilaaf ladate hue maare gaye sainikon kii qurbaani ko chota kar rahi he
 Is using her father
 dhundne waalon ko usee you-tub par yahi video mila hoga lekin unhone aap tak yah baat nahin failaai kyonki koshish he ki aap rashtrawaad ke naam par sankate rahen
 Keep giving the feeling of violence inside you a chance
 gurmeher ke post ne jo hasil kiya wo hazaar mixilon se bhi duniya main ajtak kahin bhi hasil nahin ho sakaa he
 Sibling Country
 bhai bahan kaa desh
 We did not use the word martyr
 ham nahin karte hai
 You ask why we do not use martyrs, who answer
 or ye jawaab grih rajya mantri kiren rijiju ne loksabhaa main diya he
 In reply to the question of Lalganj MP Neelam Sonkar on 22 December 2015, the Minister of State for Home Affairs said that "the Ministry of Defense has informed that the word 'martyr' is not used in the context of any casualties in the Indian Armed Forces
" isi prakaar kisi kaary yaa kaarywahi ke dauraan kendriya sashastr police balon or assam rifles ke javaanon kii mrityu ho jane ke sandarbh main bhi aisa shabd prayukt nahin hota he
 The same answer was given by former Minister of State for Home RPN Singh in Lok Sabha on 18 February 2014 that the government has never defined the term martyr
 abivipi ko kiren rijiju se poochna chahie ki desh ke liye jaan dene vaale sainikon ke liye shahid shabd kaa istemaal kyon nahin hota he
 The government and the military do not call those who sacrificed their lives a martyr
 yah jawaab aapako loksabhaa kii website se mil jaayenge
 You can take a print out and tweet them
 bharat sarkaar seemaa par jaan dene vaale sainikon ke liye shahid shabd kaa istemaal nahin karti he
 Be cautious about newspapers and TV or else you will be among those who grumble the fleet of this country
 inamen se zyaadaatar kaa kaam hukumat ke liye zindaabad bolnaa ho gaya he
 Gurmehar Kaur has spoken as much as she spoke
 uske virodh main log bole to samarthan main bhi bole hai
 She is a student isse badi baat kya ho sakati he ki pratham varsh kii is chaatra kaa saath uske shikshakon ne diya he
 Teachers in the English Department of Lady Shri Ram College have issued a statement which states, 'we are a faculty member of the English Department of Lady Shri Ram College, clearly and strongly supporting our student Gurmehar Kaur
 uniwarsity se jude muddon par apane vichaaron ko rakhane ke uske adhikaar kaa samarthan karte hai
 It is quite satisfying for us teachers that they have expressed themselves with great sensitivity, creativity and bravery rather than resorting to silence on the environment around them
 hamen lagata he ki shiksha sansthaanon kaa ye kartavya he ki wo apane chaatro ko hinsaatmak badale kii karrwai ke dar se dur unhen samvedansheel or javabdeh banaaen or unamem aalochanatmak chintan kii kshamta viksit karen
 We are proud that Gurmehar has performed his duty as a young citizen of this country
 use mil rahi hinsa or barbarta kii dhamkiyon kii ham ninda karte hai
 Social media responses by public figures such as Virender Sehwag and Randeep Hooda are shameful forms of intimidation and fear that Gurmehar is facing, towards the violent mob that the university has recently witnessed
 ham janata se samajhadaari kii apil karte hai
 We also appeal to those institutions that have the responsibility to restore people's trust in law and justice and provide an environment for our young citizens to think fearlessly and express themselves
 
 
 ' Governments have a lot of power
 ham or aap jab is ghatana ko bhul jaayenge to wo koi tarika nikaalegi
 The teachers supporting Gurmehar Kaur will harass her
 notice bhejegi
 They will get their register checked
 bahut se shikshak na to apane liye bol pate hai na apane chaatr ke liye
 Many teachers marry in this country with dowry and roam on the day of the teacher as deities
 aise shikshakon ke liye main un shikshakon kaa naam pard rahaa hum jinhone gurmeher kaa saath diya he

 aisi story ke liye taiyaar rahiye ki samarthan karne vaale teacheron ko kaise pareshaan kiya gaya
 What should a teacher do to not support her student, especially when the minister and MP are speaking against her
 twitor par use balaatkaar karne kii dhamkiyaan di ja rahi hon or likhakar gaaliyaan di ja rahi hon
 Suppose your daughter studies there, what should the teacher do
 is lihaaz se ye badi baat he
 The ABVP organized a tricolor trip on its behalf on Monday
 bijepi netaa shina ensi ne kaha he ki jise bhi pareshaani he use lekar bahes honi chahie
 There should be no place for violence
 abivipi ke netaa saket bahuguna ne morris nagar thane main shikaayat darj karai he
 It has been said that through the media from all over the country and also in TV studios, it has been said that some people are threatening to kill and rape them on social media
 desh ke kisi bhi naagarik ko aisi dhamkiyaan milanaa galat he
 The police should take strong action against such elements
 durbhaagya se gurmeher ji hamaare sanghathan abivipi par aarope laga rahi hai lekin main saaf karnaa chahta hum ki hamaara koi bhi daayitvadharee isamen shaamil nahin he
 As of late, Saket Bahuguna has done a good job
 saket ko kiren rijiju se bhi kahana chahie ki aap gurmeher kaa saath dijie, suraksha kiijie kyonki wo akeli he
 Even though he has opposed us
 phir bhi jitna uske bas main he utana to saket ne kiya hi
 Saket should now look at the pictures in which the people of his organization are shown committing violence
 wo chahen to hinsa karne vaale sadasyon ko nikaal sakate hai
 Even though the violence of the other factions remains in their organization, Saket Bahuguna has a great chance to respond to the opponents and send a message to his organization that we will not commit violence
 ummid he saket bahuguna kii yah baat mantriyon or saansadon tak pahonchegi jo gurmeher ke dimaag ko dooshit karne waalon kaa pataa laga rahe the
 Based on his one year old video, he was challenging his patriotism
 kisi bhi sarkaar kaa numaayinda ladakiyon kii baat ko bhale naapsand kare magar uski samaj yaa swatantra soch ko chunauti nahin de saktaa he
 However, now Gurmehar has made a statement separating himself from further proceedings, 'main campan se khud ko alag kar rahi hum
 Congratulations to all of you
 mujhe akelaa chhod den
 i said what i had to say
 ek cheez jo nishchit he ki ab ham hinsa karne yaa kisi ko dhamkee dene se pehle do baar sochenge, or isliye meraa virodh tha
 This campaign is for students, not for me
 march main badi sankhya main hissaa len jo koi bhi mere saahas or bahaduree par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 i will say to them that i have shown more courage than i have
 ' Gurmehar Kaur has done her work
 unke saath or unke pehle bhi bahut si ladakiyon ne awaz uthaai he
 We asked some young girls how the society around them treats them when they speak, for the first time or they speak again and again
 ve pehle kis dar se khud ko azaad karti hai or jab azaad hoti hai to unka bolnaa kis tarah se or kis kis ko daraa detaa he
 Who are the girls who say that they speak a lot, if you speak, then see, the purpose of today's prime time is to bring the girls who speak in response, so that you can see them
 zarur ladki hone ke kaaran use koi phayda nahin milanaa chahie, uski baat kaa tarkon ke aadhaar virodh hona chahie
 There should be debate, but when someone silences a girl, it should not be right for her to speak, to support her for her courage
 miranda house kii chaatra hani ne ek video hamen bheja he jisamen wo kah rahi hai, 'sabko awaz uthaani chahie, main nahin ham nahin to koun awaz uthayega
 'there is so much instruction for girls, yet someone comes forward to speak
 inaki parivaar waalon se guzarish he ki itnaa bhi na daren
 Siddhi says that whenever girls accompanying her are to speak, they are reminded of safety and kept silent
 wo koun log hai jo ladki ke bolne par khatara ban jate hai
 Resist his point
 asahmat hoiye lekin use yah bolne vaale koun log hote hai jo kehete hai ki thik nahin hoga
 Is such a voice coming from people sitting in a chair
 kahin aap aise logon kaa samarthan to nahin karte jo ladakiyon ke bolne par dekh lene kii baat karte hai
 There is no dearth of such people from society to all governments
 yamini dikshit aisi hi ek chaatra hai jo bolne ke apane anubhav ko aapse saajha karnaa chaahati hai
 Yamini is fighting for a place in the university where any kind of differences can be resolved through dialogue
 ramajas college main jhagade kaise hue, pathar kisne phenke, police kya kar rahi thi, isaki jaanch ho rahi he or kabhi nateeja nahin aayega
 So in prime time our motive is not to go into the reasons or side opposition to that quarrel
 ham gurmeher ko lekar hue vivaad ke sandarbh main dekhne kii koshish kar rahe hai ki jab koi ladki bolti he to uske saath kya kya hota he
 How does she fight herself before speaking, how does the world fight her when she speaks
 ham baat kar rahe hai ki hinsa kaa dar samaapt karne kii zimmedaari jitna abivipi kii he utani hi isa kii he, in donon se sabase adhik javabdehi police or uniwarsity kii he
 We have taken consent from these girls, they have also shown courage that they will speak on the situation of speaking
 duniya main virodh kaa tarika sarkaar nahin tay karegi
 People will decide
 ab dekhiye pradhanmantri ne man kii baat shuru kii
 In response, Congress leader Sandeep Dixit started talking about work
 ve bhi radio ke zariye kaam kii baat main pradhanmantri se sawaal karte hai or internet par daal dete hai
 This is how democracy thrives
 tarah tarah kii awaazen sunai detii hai
 Between these voices, you choose someone as Prime Minister and you do not choose anyone
 miranda house kii aditi kahati hai, 'main kisi sanghathan kii nahin hum
 If someone did not like something, they should have a peaceful demonstration
 unke paas soshal media par bahut se log likhane se darate hai
 They are running away from politics
 yah raajnneeti ke liye acha nahin he
 Why do they think that the gang of abusers will start writing anonymously
 aap gaali dene waalon kii profile check kiijie
 See which political party they are supporters of
 whatsap aajkal soochna ke naam par kachra failaayaa ja rahaa he
 There are rumors of anonymity
 puraa tantra laga hua he kisi ko bheetar bheetar badnaam karne main
 Probably for all these reasons especially ordinary women are afraid to write
 gurmeher ke post par bhi kisi kisi baaten likhi gai hai
 The police has registered a case
 dekhte hai kya hota he
 On Tuesday, a march took place at Delhi University
 is march kaa aayojan chaatr or shikshakon ne kiya tha
 The AISA organization was also involved
 is march main sarvapriya sangwan ne un ladakiyon se baat kii jo kisi sanghathan kii to nahin hai magar hinsa kii raajnneeti ke virodh main ain thim
 Hopefully the college administration will not disturb such speaking girls but will issue a letter to them that you have brightened the name of the college by participating in a peaceful demonstration
 aisa patr college ke principal ko dena chahie
 It should be given to the members of ABVP and also to the people of AISA
 or un chaatro ko bhi jo kisi sanghathan se nahin hai jaise aditi
 Nidikshma Sharma is a student of Ramjas
 wo kahati hai, 'hamane dekha ki kaise hamaari uniwarsity rit place main badal gai
 This thing is meant to be kept
 virodh karnaa zaruri he kyonki wo hamen daraana chaahate hai
 ' soshal media par ham kaisaa samaaj banane de rahe hai jahaan ladakiyon ko bolte vakt sochna pade ki khatara to nahin he
 If you come out of the house then there is danger, stay at home and speak to the world even then there is danger jab jubaan hi nahin bachegi to betiyaan kiske liye bachengi
 Will the statistics department and women's welfare department survive for data
 bahut si ladkiyaan hai jo in gaali dene vaale girohon kaa muqabla kar rahi hai
 His contribution will be remembered in times to come
 gaali dene vaale ek baat yaad rakhen
 Governments and political parties will quit using them
 ve soshal media main chaahe jo likh len, jis bhi netaa kaa naam le len magar samaaj main kabhi nahin bataa sakenge ki ve kisi raajnneetik dal ke samarthan main gaaliyaan likhte hai
 Threaten people
 ek chaatra pranjal ne kaha, 'pehle main is protest main aana nahin chaahati thi kyonki mere parent bahut chintit the
 It is not that they support ABVP, but they are afraid of ABVP not to do anything to me
 pranjal kii tarah hi sarvapriya ko dilli vishvavidhyalay ke march main skool kii ek chaatra mili
 Aditi wo pranjal ke saath hi thi
 Aditi said that fear has become her weapon and it is more important for girls to protest because they are told that you are weak
 tippaniyan Various types of protests are taking place in the world
 bharat main hi haazi ali dargah or shani mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh ko lekar kitna jabardast andolan hua
 Women started this movement
 apane sawaal ke naam par vot lene ke liye nahin balki samaaj ko badalane ke liye
 You remember Nikita Azad
 patiala kii nikita ne akele napkin andolan kii shuruyaat kar di
 Nikita wrote a letter to the trustee of the Sabarimala temple that i am a twenty year old girl, my eyes, ears, nose, lips, hands, feet are all like other human beings
 main ek aurat hum jise maahvaaree hoti he
 i have heard mother say that one should not go to temples at such times
 aurat apavitra hoti he
 This letter from Nikita created uproar in the country in which she asked the Sabarimala people why women are being prevented from coming to the temple during menstruation
 yah sawaal usne akele uthaaya
 Congress did not lift from bjp's platform
 in dalon ke netaaon kii saansen phool jaaengi
 So it is important that someone should raise their voice alone
 jab koi aisa kare to ham saath den
 Also ask a voice person
 nikita se bhi sawaal hue magar use sawaal karne ke liye daraana thik nahin he
 Girls are raising their voices
 inhen akele main yaa bheed main kisi bhi kaaran se maarane waalon ko dhamkaane waalon kaa saath mat dijie
 It may be that the crowd has the right arguments, reasons, but it is not the court
 wo kanoon nahin he
 He does not have the right to decide on the road for the right thing
 yah baat chemistry ke silebus kaa nahin he
 Is in the syllabus of common life
 bina skool gaye samaj main aa sakati he
 What was Gandhi's biggest contribution? unhone aam se aam logon ko is dar se azaad kar diya ki bina lathi ke banduukon se las or 200 saal se jami british hukumat kaa virodh kar sakate hai
 Without fear
 is buniyadi dar se jo bhi azaad karaane nikalataa he, samaaj or sarkaar ko dar lag jaataa he
 You go to Twitter and see what language has been used against Gurmehar
 ye isliye ki koi ladki sarkaar police dekh kar chup rahe
 Did not say
 magar ladki thodi ziddi nikali kah diya ki darati nahin he
 Now she has said that she has lifted her voice, now she will be silent
 baat sahi bhi he
 She is not scared, she has now put it on you that if you can stand with a single girl then show up
 koi ram sahab hai jo bharat or pakistan ke bich yuddh ke khilaaf hai
 Encourage peace
 vahi you tub main aise sandesh daalate hai
 On 28 April 2016, Gurmehar had posted this video in Hindi and English for him
 gurmeher cor is video main bataa rahi hai ki jab wo do saal kii thi to uske pita shahid ho gaye, chah saal kii thi to ek burkevali ko maarane kaa bhi prayaas kiya kyonki use lagata tha ki mere pita kii maut kii zimmedaar vahi he
 His mother then explained that my father was killed by war, not by Pakistan
 usne yahi likhaa ki nafrat ko bhoolanaa sikh liya
 It was not easy but not too difficult
 agar main aisa kar sakati hum to aap bhi kar sakate hai
 Today i am a soldier just like my father
 main bharat or pakistan ke bich shanti ke liye ladati hum kyonki agar yuddh nahin hua hota to mere pita aaj mere paas hote
 The world speaks against war
 sabko pataa he ki yuddh insaaniyat kaa dushman he isliye chhutbhaiya se lekar bade netaa shanti kii baat karte hai
 When Gurmehar put this video on youtube, a young Pakistani man Faiyaz Khan supported him
 abhi tak aapane mitra desh suna hoga, shatru desh suna hoga, faiyaaz khan ne gurmeher cor ke saath ek nae desh kii kalpana pesh kii
 Sibling country means siblings' country
 ham zindagi main isliye aate hai nayaa or kuubasurat sochane
 Fayyaz Khan lives in Australia
 6 may 2016 ko ye video you tub par daalaa
 There is some Ram sahib who runs a movement on You Tube to encourage peace between India and Pakistan
 usee video main faiyaz kehete hai
 
 
 Hi Gurmehar Kaur, i am Fayaz Khan from Pakistan
 jab main pehali baar australia aayaa to sabhi bharatiyon ko vaise dekhtaa tha jaise mujhe skool main sikhaaya gaya tha
 But soon we started eating in the class room, sharing chairs as if we were close friends
 kargil yuddh main tumhaare pita kii maut par ham sabhi ko afsos he
 i have seen war, have seen deaths in my hometown of Swat but have not lost any member of my house by luck, but i have thousands of Gurmehar Kaur around me
 main bharat aana chahta hum bina kisi viza kii pabandi kii
 We will fight together against these restrictions
 seemaa ke donon taraf hazaron logon ko gurmeher cor kii tarah takalifon se guzaranaa na pade, ham iske liye ladenge
 i cannot give you the love of your father, but of course you have got a brother from the enemy country
 chalo is duniya main ek anokhaa rishta banaate hai jahaan bhai ek musalmaan he or bahan ek sikh
 Now this enemy country replaces the word with Sibling country
 matlab bhai bahan kaa desh kar dete hai
 This effect was from Gurmehar's video
 gurmeher cor ke video ke khilaaf bhi kai video aa rahe hai
 He is also being criticized
 hamaara focus is baat par he jab koi akeli ladki bolti he to kya hota he
 Go to Twitter and submit the abuses given to Gurmehar Kaur
 nari devi he ke naam par nautanki karne vaale samaaj kii pole khul jaaegi
 What is the point, Gurmehar Kaur posted the video that she is not afraid of ABVP
 magar use kinare karne ke liye ek saal purana video nikaala gaya or is tarah pesh kiya gaya jaise wo pakistan ke khilaaf ladate hue maare gaye sainikon kii qurbaani ko chota kar rahi he

 miranda house kii aditi kahati hai, 'main kisi sanghathan kii nahin hum
 If someone did not like something, they should have a peaceful demonstration
 unke paas soshal media par bahut se log likhane se darate hai
 They are running away from politics
 yah raajnneeti ke liye acha nahin he
 Why do they think that the gang of abusers will start writing anonymously
 aap gaali dene waalon kii profile check kiijie
 See which political party they are supporters of
 whatsap aajkal soochna ke naam par kachra failaayaa ja rahaa he
 There are rumors of anonymity
 puraa tantra laga hua he kisi ko bheetar bheetar badnaam karne main
 Probably for all these reasons especially ordinary women are afraid to write
 gurmeher ke post par bhi kisi kisi baaten likhi gai hai
 The police has registered a case
 dekhte hai kya hota he
 On Tuesday, a march took place at Delhi University
 is march kaa aayojan chaatr or shikshakon ne kiya tha
 The AISA organization was also involved
 is march main sarvapriya sangwan ne un ladakiyon se baat kii jo kisi sanghathan kii to nahin hai magar hinsa kii raajnneeti ke virodh main ain thim
 Hopefully the college administration will not disturb such speaking girls but will issue a letter to them that you have brightened the name of the college by participating in a peaceful demonstration
 aisa patr college ke principal ko dena chahie
 It should be given to the members of ABVP and also to the people of AISA
 or un chaatro ko bhi jo kisi sanghathan se nahin hai jaise aditi
 Nidikshma Sharma is a student of Ramjas
 wo kahati hai, 'hamane dekha ki kaise hamaari uniwarsity rit place main badal gai
 This thing is meant to be kept
 virodh karnaa zaruri he kyonki wo hamen daraana chaahate hai
 ' soshal media par ham kaisaa samaaj banane de rahe hai jahaan ladakiyon ko bolte vakt sochna pade ki khatara to nahin he
 If you come out of the house then there is danger, stay at home and speak to the world even then there is danger jab jubaan hi nahin bachegi to betiyaan kiske liye bachengi
 Will the statistics department and women's welfare department survive for data
 bahut si ladkiyaan hai jo in gaali dene vaale girohon kaa muqabla kar rahi hai
 His contribution will be remembered in times to come
 gaali dene vaale ek baat yaad rakhen
 Governments and political parties will quit using them
 ve soshal media main chaahe jo likh len, jis bhi netaa kaa naam le len magar samaaj main kabhi nahin bataa sakenge ki ve kisi raajnneetik dal ke samarthan main gaaliyaan likhte hai
 Threaten people
 ek chaatra pranjal ne kaha, 'pehle main is protest main aana nahin chaahati thi kyonki mere parent bahut chintit the
 It is not that they support ABVP, but they are afraid of ABVP not to do anything to me
 pranjal kii tarah hi sarvapriya ko dilli vishvavidhyalay ke march main skool kii ek chaatra mili
 Aditi wo pranjal ke saath hi thi
 Aditi said that fear has become her weapon and it is more important for girls to protest because they are told that you are weak
 tippaniyan Various types of protests are taking place in the world
 bharat main hi haazi ali dargah or shani mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh ko lekar kitna jabardast andolan hua
 Women started this movement
 apane sawaal ke naam par vot lene ke liye nahin balki samaaj ko badalane ke liye
 You remember Nikita Azad
 patiala kii nikita ne akele napkin andolan kii shuruyaat kar di
 Nikita wrote a letter to the trustee of the Sabarimala temple that i am a twenty year old girl, my eyes, ears, nose, lips, hands, feet are all like other human beings
 main ek aurat hum jise maahvaaree hoti he
 i have heard mother say that one should not go to temples at such times
 aurat apavitra hoti he
 This letter from Nikita created uproar in the country in which she asked the Sabarimala people why women are being prevented from coming to the temple during menstruation
 yah sawaal usne akele uthaaya
 Congress did not lift from bjp's platform
 in dalon ke netaaon kii saansen phool jaaengi
 So it is important that someone should raise their voice alone
 jab koi aisa kare to ham saath den
 Also ask a voice person
 nikita se bhi sawaal hue magar use sawaal karne ke liye daraana thik nahin he
 Girls are raising their voices
 inhen akele main yaa bheed main kisi bhi kaaran se maarane waalon ko dhamkaane waalon kaa saath mat dijie
 It may be that the crowd has the right arguments, reasons, but it is not the court
 wo kanoon nahin he
 He does not have the right to decide on the road for the right thing
 yah baat chemistry ke silebus kaa nahin he
 Is in the syllabus of common life
 bina skool gaye samaj main aa sakati he
 Gurmehar Kaur is telling in this video that when she was two years old, her father was martyred, when she was six years old, she even tried to kill a burqewali because she thought she was the one responsible for my father's death
 tab uski maa ne samajhaayaa ki pakistan ne nahin mere pita ko jang ne maaraa he
 He wrote that he learned to forget hatred
 yah aasaan nahin tha lekin bahut mushkil bhi nahin
 If i can do it, you can too
 aaj main bhi apane pita kii tarah hi ek sainik hum
 i fight for peace between India and Pakistan because if there had not been a war, my father would have been with me today
 duniya yuddh ke kilaaf bolti he
 Everyone knows that war is the enemy of humanity so that's why leaders from smallpox to big talk talk about peace
 gurmeher ne jab yah video you tub par daalaa to uskaa saath pakistan ke ek noujvaan faiyaaz khan ne diya
 Till now you must have heard the allied country, the enemy country, Fayyaz Khan introduced the idea of a new country with Gurmehar Kaur
 sibling desh yani bhai bahan kaa desh
 This is why we come to life thinking new and beautiful
 australia main rahete hai faiyaaz khan
 On 6 May 2016, this video was uploaded to youtube
 koi ram sahab hai jo bharat pakistan ke bich shanti ko protsaahit karne ke liye you tub par andolan chalaate hai
 In the same video, Fayaz says
 
 
 hai gurmeher cor, main fayaaz khan hum pakistan se
 When i first came to Australia, i used to see all Indians as i was taught in school
 lekin jaldi hi humlog class room main khaanaa, kursiyaan saajha karne lage jaise ham kareebi dost hon
 We all regret the death of your father in the Kargil war
 maine yuddh dekha he, apane shahar swat main mautein dekhi hai lekin kismat se apane ghar ke kisi sadsy ko nahin khoyaa, lekin mere aasapaas hazaron gurmeher cor hai
 i want to come to India without any visa restriction
 ham donon in paabandiyon ke kilaaf mil kar ladenge
 Thousands of people on both sides of the border do not have to go through the hardships like Gurmehar Kaur, we will fight for it
 main tumhen tumhaare pita kaa pyaar to nahin de saktaa, lekin beshak tumhen dushman desh se ek bhai mil gaya he
 Let's create a unique relationship in this world where the brother is a Muslim and the sister a Sikh
 ab is dushman desh shabd ko sibling desh se badal dete hai
 That means, let's do siblings' country
 ye asar hua tha gurmeher ke video kaa
 There are many videos coming against Gurmehar Kaur's video as well
 unki aalochana bhi ho rahi he
 Our focus is on what happens when a single girl speaks
 aap twitor par jaakar gurmeher cor ko di gai gaaliyon ko jamaa kiijie
 In the name of Nari Devi Hai, the society of the gimmick will open
 mul baat kya he, gurmeher cor ne video daalaa ki wo abivipi se nahin darati he
 But to shore it up, a year old video was taken out and presented as if it is shortening the sacrifices of the soldiers killed while fighting against Pakistan
 apane pita kaa istemaal kar rahi he
 The seekers may have found the same video on the same youtube, but they did not spread it to you, because the effort is to keep on cracking in the name of nationalism
 apane andar hinsa kii bhaavana ko mauka dete rahen
 What Gurmehar's post has achieved has not been achieved anywhere in the world even with thousands of missiles
 sibling desh
 Country of siblings
 hamane shahid shabd kaa istemaal nahin kiya
 We do not
 aap puuchhiye ki ham shahid kaa istemaal kyon nahin karte hai, jo jawaab dete hai
 And this answer has been given by the Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju in the Lok Sabha
 22 disambar 2015 ko lalganj kii saansad neelam sonkar ke sawaal ke jawaab main grih rajya mantri ne kaha ki ''raksha mantralay ne suchit kiya he ki 'shahid' shabd bhartiya sashastr senaaon main kinhin cazcelatiz ke sandarbh main prayukt nahin kiya jaataa
 Similarly, such a term is not used to refer to the death of soldiers of Central Armed Police Forces and Assam Rifles during an action or action
 yahi jawaab 18 farvir 2014 ko purv grih rajya mantri arpyen singh ne loksabhaa main diya tha ki sarkaar ne kabhi shahid shabd ko paribhaashit nahin kiya he
 The ABVP should ask Kiren Rijiju why the word martyr is not used for soldiers who die for the country
 sarkaar or sena apni jaan kii qurbaani dene vaale ko shahid nahin kahati he
 You will get this answer from the Lok Sabha website
 aap print out lekar inhen twit kar sakate hai
 The Indian government does not use the word martyr for soldiers who died on the border
 akhbaar or tivi ko lekar satark ho jaaiye varna is desh kaa bedaa gark karne waalon main aap bhi shaamil honge
 Most of these work has become alive for the sake of government
 gurmeher cor ne jitna bol liya tha utana bol liya he
 People have spoken against him and have also spoken in support
 wo ek chaatra he
 What can be bigger than this, that this first year student has been supported by her teachers
 ladi shriram college ke angrezi vibhaag ke teacheron ne ek bayaan jari kiya he jisamen likhaa he, 'ham ladi shriram college ke angrezi vibhaag ke faikalti member saafataur par or majbooti se apni chaatra gurmeher cor kaa samarthan karte hai
 Supports his right to express his views on university-related issues
 ham shikshakon ke liye ye kaafii santoshjanak he ki usne apane aasapaas bane maahaul par chuppi kaa sahaara lene ke bajaay badi hi samvedansheeltaa, rachanaatmakataa or bahaduree ke saath khud ko vyakt kiya he
 We feel that it is the duty of educational institutions to make their students sensitive and accountable and away from the fear of violent revenge action and develop their capacity for critical thinking
 hamen garv he ki gurmeher ne is desh ke ek yuva naagarik ke taur par apana kartavya nibhaayaa he
 We condemn the threats of violence and vandalism she is receiving
 virendra sahvaag or randeep huda jaise public figures dwaara soshal media par die gaye jawaab us dhamkee or dar kaa sharmnaak rup hai jiskaa saamana gurmeher kar rahi hai, us hinsak bheed kii taraf se jiskaa rup uniwarsity ne haal hi main dekha
 We appeal to the public for understanding
 ham un sansthaanon se bhi samajhadaari kii apil karte hai jinke haath main ye zimmedaari he ki wo kaanoon or nyaay main logon kaa bharosa behaal karen or hamaare yuva nagarikon ke liye bina dare sochane or khud ko vyakt karne kaa maahaul den
 
 
 ' sarkaron ke paas takat bahut hoti he
 When we and you forget this incident, it will find a way out
 gurmeher cor kaa samarthan dene vaale shikshakon ko pareshaan karegi
 Will send notice unke register check karavaaegi
 Many teachers neither speak for themselves nor for their students
 bahut se shikshak is desh main dahez lekar shaadi karte hai or shikshak diwas ke din devtaa banakar ghoomte hai
 For such teachers, i am reading the names of those teachers who have supported Gurmehar
 janet lalwampui, nangoum maheshakanta singh, maitreyi mandal, jonthan vagchz, rachita mittal, shernaz kama, aarti minocha, ruyeesana shrauf, madhu grover, vafaa hamid, reeta joshi, maaya joshi, tania sachdev, mitali mishra, arunima re, dipti nath, karunaa rajeev, tania sachdev
 Be prepared for a story of how the supporting teachers were harassed
 ek teacher ko apni chaatra kaa saath nahin dena chahie to kya karnaa chahie, khaskar tab jab uske kilaaf mantri or saansad bol rahe hon
 On Twitter, he is being threatened with rape and abuses in writing
 maan lijie ki aapaki beti vahaan padhati ho to teacher ko kya karnaa chahie
 In this sense, it is a big deal
 abivipi ne somvaar ko apni taraf se tirangaa yatra kaa aayojan kiya tha
 BJP leader Shaina NC has said that there should be a debate on whoever is in trouble
 hinsa kii koi jagah nahin honi chahie
 ABVP leader Saket Bahuguna has filed a complaint at the Morris Nagar police station
 kaha he ki media ke madhyam se puure desh se or mujhase bhi tivi studio main ye baat kahi he ki kuch log unhen soshal media par jaan se maarane or balaatkaar kii dhamkee de rahe hai
 It is wrong for any citizen of the country to receive such threats
 police ko aise tatwon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kerani chahie
 Unfortunately Gurmehar ji is blaming our organization ABVP but i want to make it clear that none of our liabilities are involved in this
 der se hi sahi, saket bahuguna ne acha kaam kiya he
 Saket should also tell Kiren Rijiju that you should support Gurmehar, protect because she is alone
 bhale hi usne hamaara virodh kiya he
 Still, Saket did as much as he has
 saket ko ab un tasveeron ko dekhnaa chahie jisamen uske sanghathan ke log hinsa karte dikhaaye gaye hai
 If they want, they can remove the members who commit violence
 bhale hi duusare gut ke hinsa karne vaale apane sanghathan main bane rahen magar saket bahuguna ke paas ek shandaar mauka he virodhiyon ko jawaab dene kaa or apane sanghathan ko sandesh dene kaa ki ham hinsa nahin karenge
 It is expected that this talk of Saket Bahuguna will reach the ministers and mps who were looking for those who corrupted Gurmehar's mind
 uske ek saal puraane video ke aadhaar par uski deshbhakti yaa samadh ko chunauti de rahe the
 The representative of any government may dislike the talk of the girls but cannot challenge their understanding or independent thinking
 baharhaal ab gurmeher ne khud ko aage kii kaarywahi se alag karte hue bayaan diya he ki, 'I am separating myself from the campaign
 aap sabhi ko badhai
 Leave me alone mujhe jo kahana tha wo maine kah diya
 One thing that is certain is that now we will think twice before committing violence or threatening someone, and so i was opposed
 ye campan chaatro ke liye he, mere liye nahin
 Participate in large numbers in March, whoever is questioning my courage and bravery
 unke liye kahuungi ki maine zarurat se zyaada himmat dikhaai he
 ' gurmeher cor ne apana kaam kar diya he
 Many girls have voiced with them and even before them
 hamane kuch noujvaan ladakiyon se poocha ki jab wo bolti hai, pehali baar bolti hai yaa baar baar bolti hai to unke aas paas kaa samaaj unke saath kis tarah kaa bartaav karata he
 With what fear does she first liberate herself, and when she is free, how can she speak and which scares someone
 koun hai jo ladakiyon ke bolne par kehete hai ki bahut bolti ho, bologi to dekh lenaa, aaj ke prime time kaa makasad iske jawaab main un ladakiyon ko samaane laana he jo bolti hai, taaki aap unhen dekh saken
 Surely she should not get any benefit due to being a girl, her talk should be opposed on the basis of arguments
 bahes honi chahie lekin jab koi kisi ladki ko chup karaaye to uski baat ke liye na sahi, uski himmat ke liye uskaa saath dena chahie
 Honey, a student of Miranda House, has sent us a video in which she is saying, 'everyone should raise their voice, not me or who will raise their voice
 ' ladakiyon ke liye kitni hidaayat hoti he phir bhi koi na koi aage aati he bolne ke liye
 His family is requested not to be afraid too much
 siddhi kahati hai ki jab bhi unke saath kii ladkiyaan bolne ko hoti hai unhen suraksha kii yaad dilaakar chup kara diya jaataa he
 Who are those people who become a threat when a girl speaks? uski baat kaa virodh kiijie
 Disagree but who are the people who say it, that they say will not be okay
 kya aisi awaz kursi par baithe logon se bhi aa rahi he
 Somewhere you do not support such people who talk about seeing girls when they speak
 samaaj se lekar tamaam sarkaron main aise logon kii kami nahin hai
 Yamini Dixit is one such student who wants to share her speaking experience with you
 yamini uniwarsity main ek aisi jagah ke liye lard rahi he jahaan kisi bhi tarah kaa matbhed baatcheet ke zariye suljhaayaa ja sake
 How the fights took place in Ramjas College, who threw stones, what the police were doing, it is being investigated and there will never be a result
 isliye prime time main hamaara makasad us jhagade ke kaarnon yaa paksh vipaksh main janaa nahin he
 We are trying to see in the context of the controversy over Gurmehar what happens to a girl when she speaks
 wo bolne se pehle khud se kaise ladati he, jab wo bolti he to usase duniya kaise ladati he
 We are talking that the responsibility of ending the fear of violence is as much as abvp's responsibility to AISA, the police and university have the most accountability for both of them
 hamane in ladakiyon se sahmati lee he, unhone bhi himmat dikhaai he ki ve bolne ke halaat par bolengi
 The government will not decide the way of protest in the world
 log tay karenge
 Now see, the Prime Minister started Mann Ki Baat
 iske jawaab main congress ke netaa sandip dikshit ne kaam kii baat shuru kar di
 They also question the Prime Minister about the work through radio and put it on the Internet
 is tarah se loktantr faltaa phulata he
 Different sounds are heard
 in awaazon ke bich hi aap kisi ko pradhanmantri chunate hai or kisi ko nahin chunate hai
 Aditi from Miranda House says, 'I don't belong to any organization
 agar kisi ko kuch pasand nahin tha to unhen shantipurna pradarshan karnaa chahie
 He has many people afraid to write on social media
 ve raajnneeti se bhaagane lage hai
 This is not good for politics
 unhen kyon lagata he ki gaali dene waalon kaa giroh anaap shanaap likhane lagegaa
 Check the profile of your abuser
 dekhiye ki ve kis raajnneetik dal ke samarthak hai
 whatsapp is being spread in the name of information nowadays
 anaap shanaap afvaahen hai
 The whole system is engaged in defaming someone inside
 shaayad inhen sab vajahon se khaskar aam mahilaayein likhane se ghabraati hai
 What kind of things have been written on Gurmehar's post too
 police ne maamla to darj kiya he
 Let's see what happens
 mangalvaar ko dilli vishvavidhyalay main ek march hua
 This march was organized by students and teachers
 isa sanghathan bhi shaamil tha
 In this March, Sarvapriya Sangwan spoke to girls who are not from any organization but came against the politics of violence
 ummid he ki college prashasan aisi bolne vaali ladakiyon ko pareshaan nahin karegaa balki unhen ek patr jari karegaa ki aapane shantipurna pradarshan main hissaa lekar college kaa naam raushan kiya he
 Such a letter should be given to the principal of the college
 abivipi ke sadasyon ko bhi dena chahie or isa waalon ko bhi
 And also those students who are not from any organization like Aditi
 nidikshma sharma ramajas kii chaatra hai
 She says, 'we saw how our university turned into Riot Place
 ye baat rakhane ke liye hoti he
 It is important to protest because they want to scare us
 ' What kind of society are we letting on social media where girls have to think while speaking that there is danger? ghar se niklo to khatara, ghar main rahakar duniya se bolo tab bhi khatara
 When the tongue is not left, the daughters will save for whom
 kya sankhyikee vibhaag or mahila kalyaan vibhaag ke aankadon ke liye bachengi
 There are many girls who are combating these abusive gangs
 aane vaale vakt main unka yogadan yaad kiya jayega
 Remember one thing that abuses
 sarkarein or raajnneetik dal unka istemaal kar chhod denge
 Whatever they write on social media, they can take the name of any leader but in society they will never be able to tell that they write abuses in support of any political party
 logon ko dhamkaate hai
 Pranjal, a student, said, 'at first i did not want to come to this Protest because my parents were very worried
 aisa nahin he ki wo abivipi ko saport karte hai, lekin wo abivipi se darate hai ki kahin wo mujhe kuch na kar den
 Like Pranjal, Sarvapriya got a school student in Delhi University in March
 aditi
 She was with Pranjal
 aditi ne kaha ki dar unka hathiyaar ho gaya he or ladakiyon ke liye virodh karnaa zyaada zaruri he kyonki unhen bolaa jaataa he ki tum kamazor ho
 The comments duniya main tarah tarah ke virodh pradarshan ho rahe hai
 What a tremendous movement in India for the entry of women into the Haji Ali Dargah and the Shani Temple
 mahilaon ne yah andolan chalaaya
 Not to take votes in the name of your question but to change the society
 aapako nikita azaad yaad he
 Nikita of Patiala started the napkin movement alone
 nikita ne sabarimala mandir ke trustee ko patr likh diya ki main bees saal kii ladki hum, mere aankh, kaan, naak, hont, haath, paanv sab hai jaise duusare insaanon ke hai
 i am a woman who has menstruation
 maine maa ko kehete suna he ki aise samay main mandiron main nahin janaa chahie
 a woman is impure
 nikita ke is patr ne desh main hangaamaa machaa diya jisamen usne sabarimala waalon se poocha tha ki maahvaaree ke samay auraton ko mandir aane se kyon roka ja rahaa he
 He raised this question alone
 congress bijepi ke manch se nahin uthaaya
 The breath of the leaders of these parties will swell
 isliye zaruri he ki koi akele bhi awaz uthaae
 When someone does this, then we support
 awaz uthaane vaale se sawaal bhi karen
 Nikita was also questioned but it is not right to scare her
 ladkiyaan awaz uthaa rahi hai
 Do not support those who kill them in private or in the crowd for any reason
 ho saktaa he ki bheed ke paas sabase sahi tark hon, kaaran hon magar wo adaalat nahin he
 That is not the law
 sahi baat ke liye sadak par faisla karne kaa adhikaar uske paas nahin he
 This is not the case with the syllabus of chemistry
 aam zindagi ke silebus main he
 Can understand without going to school
 duniya yuddh ke kilaaf bolti he
 Everyone knows that war is the enemy of humanity so that's why leaders from smallpox to big talk talk about peace
 gurmeher ne jab yah video you tub par daalaa to uskaa saath pakistan ke ek noujvaan faiyaaz khan ne diya
 Till now you must have heard the allied country, the enemy country, Fayyaz Khan introduced the idea of a new country with Gurmehar Kaur

 maan lijie ki aapaki beti vahaan padhati ho to teacher ko kya karnaa chahie
 In this sense, it is a big deal
 abivipi ne somvaar ko apni taraf se tirangaa yatra kaa aayojan kiya tha
 BJP leader Shaina NC has said that there should be a debate on whoever is in trouble
 hinsa kii koi jagah nahin honi chahie
 ABVP leader Saket Bahuguna has filed a complaint at the Morris Nagar police station
 kaha he ki media ke madhyam se puure desh se or mujhase bhi tivi studio main ye baat kahi he ki kuch log unhen soshal media par jaan se maarane or balaatkaar kii dhamkee de rahe hai
 It is wrong for any citizen of the country to receive such threats
 police ko aise tatwon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kerani chahie
 Unfortunately Gurmehar ji is blaming our organization ABVP but i want to make it clear that none of our liabilities are involved in this
 der se hi sahi, saket bahuguna ne acha kaam kiya he
 Saket should also tell Kiren Rijiju that you should support Gurmehar, protect because she is alone
 bhale hi usne hamaara virodh kiya he
 Still, Saket did as much as he has
 saket ko ab un tasveeron ko dekhnaa chahie jisamen uske sanghathan ke log hinsa karte dikhaaye gaye hai
 If they want, they can remove the members who commit violence
 bhale hi duusare gut ke hinsa karne vaale apane sanghathan main bane rahen magar saket bahuguna ke paas ek shandaar mauka he virodhiyon ko jawaab dene kaa or apane sanghathan ko sandesh dene kaa ki ham hinsa nahin karenge
 It is expected that this talk of Saket Bahuguna will reach the ministers and mps who were looking for those who corrupted Gurmehar's mind
 uske ek saal puraane video ke aadhaar par uski deshbhakti yaa samadh ko chunauti de rahe the
 The representative of any government may dislike the talk of the girls but cannot challenge their understanding or independent thinking
 baharhaal ab gurmeher ne khud ko aage kii kaarywahi se alag karte hue bayaan diya he ki, 'I am separating myself from the campaign
 aap sabhi ko badhai
 Leave me alone mujhe jo kahana tha wo maine kah diya
 One thing that is certain is that now we will think twice before committing violence or threatening someone, and so i was opposed
 ye campan chaatro ke liye he, mere liye nahin
 Participate in large numbers in March, whoever is questioning my courage and bravery
 unke liye kahuungi ki maine zarurat se zyaada himmat dikhaai he
 ' gurmeher cor ne apana kaam kar diya he
 Many girls have voiced with them and even before them
 hamane kuch noujvaan ladakiyon se poocha ki jab wo bolti hai, pehali baar bolti hai yaa baar baar bolti hai to unke aas paas kaa samaaj unke saath kis tarah kaa bartaav karata he
 With what fear does she first liberate herself, and when she is free, how can she speak and which scares someone
 koun hai jo ladakiyon ke bolne par kehete hai ki bahut bolti ho, bologi to dekh lenaa, aaj ke prime time kaa makasad iske jawaab main un ladakiyon ko samaane laana he jo bolti hai, taaki aap unhen dekh saken
 Surely she should not get any benefit due to being a girl, her talk should be opposed on the basis of arguments
 bahes honi chahie lekin jab koi kisi ladki ko chup karaaye to uski baat ke liye na sahi, uski himmat ke liye uskaa saath dena chahie
 Honey, a student of Miranda House, has sent us a video in which she is saying, 'everyone should raise their voice, not me or who will raise their voice
 ' ladakiyon ke liye kitni hidaayat hoti he phir bhi koi na koi aage aati he bolne ke liye
 His family is requested not to be afraid too much
 siddhi kahati hai ki jab bhi unke saath kii ladkiyaan bolne ko hoti hai unhen suraksha kii yaad dilaakar chup kara diya jaataa he
 Who are those people who become a threat when a girl speaks? uski baat kaa virodh kiijie
 Disagree but who are the people who say it, that they say will not be okay
 kya aisi awaz kursi par baithe logon se bhi aa rahi he
 Somewhere you do not support such people who talk about seeing girls when they speak
 samaaj se lekar tamaam sarkaron main aise logon kii kami nahin hai
 Yamini Dixit is one such student who wants to share her speaking experience with you
 yamini uniwarsity main ek aisi jagah ke liye lard rahi he jahaan kisi bhi tarah kaa matbhed baatcheet ke zariye suljhaayaa ja sake
 How the fights took place in Ramjas College, who threw stones, what the police were doing, it is being investigated and there will never be a result
 isliye prime time main hamaara makasad us jhagade ke kaarnon yaa paksh vipaksh main janaa nahin he
 We are trying to see in the context of the controversy over Gurmehar what happens to a girl when she speaks
 wo bolne se pehle khud se kaise ladati he, jab wo bolti he to usase duniya kaise ladati he
 We are talking that the responsibility of ending the fear of violence is as much as abvp's responsibility to AISA, the police and university have the most accountability for both of them
 hamane in ladakiyon se sahmati lee he, unhone bhi himmat dikhaai he ki ve bolne ke halaat par bolengi
 The government will not decide the way of protest in the world
 log tay karenge
 Now see, the Prime Minister started Mann Ki Baat
 iske jawaab main congress ke netaa sandip dikshit ne kaam kii baat shuru kar di
 They also question the Prime Minister about the work through radio and put it on the Internet
 is tarah se loktantr faltaa phulata he
 Different sounds are heard
 in awaazon ke bich hi aap kisi ko pradhanmantri chunate hai or kisi ko nahin chunate hai
 Aditi from Miranda House says, 'I don't belong to any organization
 agar kisi ko kuch pasand nahin tha to unhen shantipurna pradarshan karnaa chahie
 He has many people afraid to write on social media
 ve raajnneeti se bhaagane lage hai
 This is not good for politics
 unhen kyon lagata he ki gaali dene waalon kaa giroh anaap shanaap likhane lagegaa
 Check the profile of your abuser
 dekhiye ki ve kis raajnneetik dal ke samarthak hai
 whatsapp is being spread in the name of information nowadays
 anaap shanaap afvaahen hai
 The whole system is engaged in defaming someone inside
 shaayad inhen sab vajahon se khaskar aam mahilaayein likhane se ghabraati hai
 What kind of things have been written on Gurmehar's post too
 police ne maamla to darj kiya he
 Let's see what happens
 mangalvaar ko dilli vishvavidhyalay main ek march hua
 This march was organized by students and teachers
 isa sanghathan bhi shaamil tha
 In this March, Sarvapriya Sangwan spoke to girls who are not from any organization but came against the politics of violence
 ummid he ki college prashasan aisi bolne vaali ladakiyon ko pareshaan nahin karegaa balki unhen ek patr jari karegaa ki aapane shantipurna pradarshan main hissaa lekar college kaa naam raushan kiya he
 Such a letter should be given to the principal of the college
 abivipi ke sadasyon ko bhi dena chahie or isa waalon ko bhi
 And also those students who are not from any organization like Aditi
 nidikshma sharma ramajas kii chaatra hai
 She says, 'we saw how our university turned into Riot Place
 ye baat rakhane ke liye hoti he
 It is important to protest because they want to scare us
 ' What kind of society are we letting on social media where girls have to think while speaking that there is danger? ghar se niklo to khatara, ghar main rahakar duniya se bolo tab bhi khatara
 When the tongue is not left, the daughters will save for whom
 kya sankhyikee vibhaag or mahila kalyaan vibhaag ke aankadon ke liye bachengi
 There are many girls who are combating these abusive gangs
 aane vaale vakt main unka yogadan yaad kiya jayega
 Remember one thing that abuses
 sarkarein or raajnneetik dal unka istemaal kar chhod denge
 Whatever they write on social media, they can take the name of any leader but in society they will never be able to tell that they write abuses in support of any political party
 logon ko dhamkaate hai
 Pranjal, a student, said, 'at first i did not want to come to this Protest because my parents were very worried
 aisa nahin he ki wo abivipi ko saport karte hai, lekin wo abivipi se darate hai ki kahin wo mujhe kuch na kar den
 Like Pranjal, Sarvapriya got a school student in Delhi University in March
 aditi
 She was with Pranjal
 aditi ne kaha ki dar unka hathiyaar ho gaya he or ladakiyon ke liye virodh karnaa zyaada zaruri he kyonki unhen bolaa jaataa he ki tum kamazor ho
 The comments duniya main tarah tarah ke virodh pradarshan ho rahe hai
 What a tremendous movement in India for the entry of women into the Haji Ali Dargah and the Shani Temple
 mahilaon ne yah andolan chalaaya
 Not to take votes in the name of your question but to change the society
 aapako nikita azaad yaad he
 Nikita of Patiala started the napkin movement alone
 nikita ne sabarimala mandir ke trustee ko patr likh diya ki main bees saal kii ladki hum, mere aankh, kaan, naak, hont, haath, paanv sab hai jaise duusare insaanon ke hai
 i am a woman who has menstruation
 maine maa ko kehete suna he ki aise samay main mandiron main nahin janaa chahie
 a woman is impure
 nikita ke is patr ne desh main hangaamaa machaa diya jisamen usne sabarimala waalon se poocha tha ki maahvaaree ke samay auraton ko mandir aane se kyon roka ja rahaa he
 He raised this question alone
 congress bijepi ke manch se nahin uthaaya
 The breath of the leaders of these parties will swell
 isliye zaruri he ki koi akele bhi awaz uthaae
 When someone does this, then we support
 awaz uthaane vaale se sawaal bhi karen
 Nikita was also questioned but it is not right to scare her
 ladkiyaan awaz uthaa rahi hai
 Do not support those who kill them in private or in the crowd for any reason
 ho saktaa he ki bheed ke paas sabase sahi tark hon, kaaran hon magar wo adaalat nahin he
 That is not the law
 sahi baat ke liye sadak par faisla karne kaa adhikaar uske paas nahin he
 This is not the case with the syllabus of chemistry
 aam zindagi ke silebus main he
 Can understand without going to school
 hai gurmeher cor, main fayaaz khan hum pakistan se
 When i first came to Australia, i used to see all Indians as i was taught in school
 lekin jaldi hi humlog class room main khaanaa, kursiyaan saajha karne lage jaise ham kareebi dost hon
 We all regret the death of your father in the Kargil war
 maine yuddh dekha he, apane shahar swat main mautein dekhi hai lekin kismat se apane ghar ke kisi sadsy ko nahin khoyaa, lekin mere aasapaas hazaron gurmeher cor hai
 i want to come to India without any visa restriction
 ham donon in paabandiyon ke kilaaf mil kar ladenge
 Thousands of people on both sides of the border do not have to go through the hardships like Gurmehar Kaur, we will fight for it
 main tumhen tumhaare pita kaa pyaar to nahin de saktaa, lekin beshak tumhen dushman desh se ek bhai mil gaya he
 Let's create a unique relationship in this world where the brother is a Muslim and the sister a Sikh
 ab is dushman desh shabd ko sibling desh se badal dete hai
 That means, let's do siblings' country
 ye asar hua tha gurmeher ke video kaa
 There are many videos coming against Gurmehar Kaur's video as well
 unki aalochana bhi ho rahi he
 Our focus is on what happens when a single girl speaks
 aap twitor par jaakar gurmeher cor ko di gai gaaliyon ko jamaa kiijie
 In the name of Nari Devi Hai, the society of the gimmick will open
 mul baat kya he, gurmeher cor ne video daalaa ki wo abivipi se nahin darati he
 But to shore it up, a year old video was taken out and presented as if it is shortening the sacrifices of the soldiers killed while fighting against Pakistan
 apane pita kaa istemaal kar rahi he
 The seekers may have found the same video on the same youtube, but they did not spread it to you, because the effort is to keep on cracking in the name of nationalism
 apane andar hinsa kii bhaavana ko mauka dete rahen
 What Gurmehar's post has achieved has not been achieved anywhere in the world even with thousands of missiles
 sibling desh
 Country of siblings
 hamane shahid shabd kaa istemaal nahin kiya
 We do not
 aap puuchhiye ki ham shahid kaa istemaal kyon nahin karte hai, jo jawaab dete hai
 And this answer has been given by the Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju in the Lok Sabha
 22 disambar 2015 ko lalganj kii saansad neelam sonkar ke sawaal ke jawaab main grih rajya mantri ne kaha ki ''raksha mantralay ne suchit kiya he ki 'shahid' shabd bhartiya sashastr senaaon main kinhin cazcelatiz ke sandarbh main prayukt nahin kiya jaataa
 Similarly, such a term is not used to refer to the death of soldiers of Central Armed Police Forces and Assam Rifles during an action or action
 yahi jawaab 18 farvir 2014 ko purv grih rajya mantri arpyen singh ne loksabhaa main diya tha ki sarkaar ne kabhi shahid shabd ko paribhaashit nahin kiya he
 The ABVP should ask Kiren Rijiju why the word martyr is not used for soldiers who die for the country
 sarkaar or sena apni jaan kii qurbaani dene vaale ko shahid nahin kahati he
 You will get this answer from the Lok Sabha website
 aap print out lekar inhen twit kar sakate hai
 The Indian government does not use the word martyr for soldiers who died on the border
 akhbaar or tivi ko lekar satark ho jaaiye varna is desh kaa bedaa gark karne waalon main aap bhi shaamil honge
 Most of these work has become alive for the sake of government
 gurmeher cor ne jitna bol liya tha utana bol liya he
 People have spoken against him and have also spoken in support
 wo ek chaatra he
 What can be bigger than this, that this first year student has been supported by her teachers
 ladi shriram college ke angrezi vibhaag ke teacheron ne ek bayaan jari kiya he jisamen likhaa he, 'ham ladi shriram college ke angrezi vibhaag ke faikalti member saafataur par or majbooti se apni chaatra gurmeher cor kaa samarthan karte hai
 Supports his right to express his views on university-related issues
 ham shikshakon ke liye ye kaafii santoshjanak he ki usne apane aasapaas bane maahaul par chuppi kaa sahaara lene ke bajaay badi hi samvedansheeltaa, rachanaatmakataa or bahaduree ke saath khud ko vyakt kiya he
 We feel that it is the duty of educational institutions to make their students sensitive and accountable and away from the fear of violent revenge action and develop their capacity for critical thinking
 hamen garv he ki gurmeher ne is desh ke ek yuva naagarik ke taur par apana kartavya nibhaayaa he
 We condemn the threats of violence and vandalism she is receiving
 virendra sahvaag or randeep huda jaise public figures dwaara soshal media par die gaye jawaab us dhamkee or dar kaa sharmnaak rup hai jiskaa saamana gurmeher kar rahi hai, us hinsak bheed kii taraf se jiskaa rup uniwarsity ne haal hi main dekha
 We appeal to the public for understanding
 ham un sansthaanon se bhi samajhadaari kii apil karte hai jinke haath main ye zimmedaari he ki wo kaanoon or nyaay main logon kaa bharosa behaal karen or hamaare yuva nagarikon ke liye bina dare sochane or khud ko vyakt karne kaa maahaul den
 
 
 ' sarkaron ke paas takat bahut hoti he
 When we and you forget this incident, it will find a way out
 gurmeher cor kaa samarthan dene vaale shikshakon ko pareshaan karegi
 Will send notice unke register check karavaaegi
 Many teachers neither speak for themselves nor for their students
 bahut se shikshak is desh main dahez lekar shaadi karte hai or shikshak diwas ke din devtaa banakar ghoomte hai
 For such teachers, i am reading the names of those teachers who have supported Gurmehar
 janet lalwampui, nangoum maheshakanta singh, maitreyi mandal, jonthan vagchz, rachita mittal, shernaz kama, aarti minocha, ruyeesana shrauf, madhu grover, vafaa hamid, reeta joshi, maaya joshi, tania sachdev, mitali mishra, arunima re, dipti nath, karunaa rajeev, tania sachdev
 Be prepared for a story of how the supporting teachers were harassed
 ek teacher ko apni chaatra kaa saath nahin dena chahie to kya karnaa chahie, khaskar tab jab uske kilaaf mantri or saansad bol rahe hon
 On Twitter, he is being threatened with rape and abuses in writing
 maan lijie ki aapaki beti vahaan padhati ho to teacher ko kya karnaa chahie
 In this sense, it is a big deal
 abivipi ne somvaar ko apni taraf se tirangaa yatra kaa aayojan kiya tha
 BJP leader Shaina NC has said that there should be a debate on whoever is in trouble
 hinsa kii koi jagah nahin honi chahie
 ABVP leader Saket Bahuguna has filed a complaint at the Morris Nagar police station
 kaha he ki media ke madhyam se puure desh se or mujhase bhi tivi studio main ye baat kahi he ki kuch log unhen soshal media par jaan se maarane or balaatkaar kii dhamkee de rahe hai
 It is wrong for any citizen of the country to receive such threats
 police ko aise tatwon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kerani chahie
 Unfortunately Gurmehar ji is blaming our organization ABVP but i want to make it clear that none of our liabilities are involved in this
 der se hi sahi, saket bahuguna ne acha kaam kiya he
 Saket should also tell Kiren Rijiju that you should support Gurmehar, protect because she is alone
 bhale hi usne hamaara virodh kiya he
 Still, Saket did as much as he has
 saket ko ab un tasveeron ko dekhnaa chahie jisamen uske sanghathan ke log hinsa karte dikhaaye gaye hai
 If they want, they can remove the members who commit violence
 bhale hi duusare gut ke hinsa karne vaale apane sanghathan main bane rahen magar saket bahuguna ke paas ek shandaar mauka he virodhiyon ko jawaab dene kaa or apane sanghathan ko sandesh dene kaa ki ham hinsa nahin karenge
 It is expected that this talk of Saket Bahuguna will reach the ministers and mps who were looking for those who corrupted Gurmehar's mind

 Saket should also tell Kiren Rijiju that you should support Gurmehar, protect because she is alone

 We are trying to see in the context of the controversy over Gurmehar what happens to a girl when she speaks
 wo bolne se pehle khud se kaise ladati he, jab wo bolti he to usase duniya kaise ladati he
 We are talking that the responsibility of ending the fear of violence is as much as abvp's responsibility to AISA, the police and university have the most accountability for both of them

 Let's see what happens
 mangalvaar ko dilli vishvavidhyalay main ek march hua
 This march was organized by students and teachers
 isa sanghathan bhi shaamil tha
 In this March, Sarvapriya Sangwan spoke to girls who are not from any organization but came against the politics of violence
 ummid he ki college prashasan aisi bolne vaali ladakiyon ko pareshaan nahin karegaa balki unhen ek patr jari karegaa ki aapane shantipurna pradarshan main hissaa lekar college kaa naam raushan kiya he
 Such a letter should be given to the principal of the college
 abivipi ke sadasyon ko bhi dena chahie or isa waalon ko bhi
 And also those students who are not from any organization like Aditi
 nidikshma sharma ramajas kii chaatra hai
 She says, 'we saw how our university turned into Riot Place
 ye baat rakhane ke liye hoti he
 It is important to protest because they want to scare us
 ' What kind of society are we letting on social media where girls have to think while speaking that there is danger? ghar se niklo to khatara, ghar main rahakar duniya se bolo tab bhi khatara
 When the tongue is not left, the daughters will save for whom
 kya sankhyikee vibhaag or mahila kalyaan vibhaag ke aankadon ke liye bachengi
 There are many girls who are combating these abusive gangs
 aane vaale vakt main unka yogadan yaad kiya jayega
 Remember one thing that abuses
 sarkarein or raajnneetik dal unka istemaal kar chhod denge
 Whatever they write on social media, they can take the name of any leader but in society they will never be able to tell that they write abuses in support of any political party
 logon ko dhamkaate hai
 Pranjal, a student, said, 'at first i did not want to come to this Protest because my parents were very worried
 aisa nahin he ki wo abivipi ko saport karte hai, lekin wo abivipi se darate hai ki kahin wo mujhe kuch na kar den
 Like Pranjal, Sarvapriya got a school student in Delhi University in March
 aditi
 She was with Pranjal

 What a tremendous movement in India for the entry of women into the Haji Ali Dargah and the Shani Temple
 mahilaon ne yah andolan chalaaya
 Not to take votes in the name of your question but to change the society
 aapako nikita azaad yaad he
 Nikita of Patiala started the napkin movement alone
 nikita ne sabarimala mandir ke trustee ko patr likh diya ki main bees saal kii ladki hum, mere aankh, kaan, naak, hont, haath, paanv sab hai jaise duusare insaanon ke hai
 i am a woman who has menstruation
 maine maa ko kehete suna he ki aise samay main mandiron main nahin janaa chahie
 a woman is impure
 nikita ke is patr ne desh main hangaamaa machaa diya jisamen usne sabarimala waalon se poocha tha ki maahvaaree ke samay auraton ko mandir aane se kyon roka ja rahaa he
 He raised this question alone
 congress bijepi ke manch se nahin uthaaya
 The breath of the leaders of these parties will swell
 isliye zaruri he ki koi akele bhi awaz uthaae
 When someone does this, then we support
 awaz uthaane vaale se sawaal bhi karen
 Nikita was also questioned but it is not right to scare her
 ladkiyaan awaz uthaa rahi hai
 Do not support those who kill them in private or in the crowd for any reason
 ho saktaa he ki bheed ke paas sabase sahi tark hon, kaaran hon magar wo adaalat nahin he
 That is not the law
 sahi baat ke liye sadak par faisla karne kaa adhikaar uske paas nahin he
 This is not the case with the syllabus of chemistry
 aam zindagi ke silebus main he
 Can understand without going to school
 yahi jawaab 18 farvir 2014 ko purv grih rajya mantri arpyen singh ne loksabhaa main diya tha ki sarkaar ne kabhi shahid shabd ko paribhaashit nahin kiya he
 The ABVP should ask Kiren Rijiju why the word martyr is not used for soldiers who die for the country
 sarkaar or sena apni jaan kii qurbaani dene vaale ko shahid nahin kahati he
 You will get this answer from the Lok Sabha website
 aap print out lekar inhen twit kar sakate hai
 The Indian government does not use the word martyr for soldiers who died on the border
 akhbaar or tivi ko lekar satark ho jaaiye varna is desh kaa bedaa gark karne waalon main aap bhi shaamil honge
 Most of these work has become alive for the sake of government

 abivipi ne somvaar ko apni taraf se tirangaa yatra kaa aayojan kiya tha
 BJP leader Shaina NC has said that there should be a debate on whoever is in trouble
 hinsa kii koi jagah nahin honi chahie
 ABVP leader Saket Bahuguna has filed a complaint at the Morris Nagar police station
 kaha he ki media ke madhyam se puure desh se or mujhase bhi tivi studio main ye baat kahi he ki kuch log unhen soshal media par jaan se maarane or balaatkaar kii dhamkee de rahe hai
 It is wrong for any citizen of the country to receive such threats
 police ko aise tatwon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kerani chahie
 Unfortunately Gurmehar ji is blaming our organization ABVP but i want to make it clear that none of our liabilities are involved in this
 der se hi sahi, saket bahuguna ne acha kaam kiya he
 Saket should also tell Kiren Rijiju that you should support Gurmehar, protect because she is alone
 bhale hi usne hamaara virodh kiya he
 Still, Saket did as much as he has
 saket ko ab un tasveeron ko dekhnaa chahie jisamen uske sanghathan ke log hinsa karte dikhaaye gaye hai
 If they want, they can remove the members who commit violence
 bhale hi duusare gut ke hinsa karne vaale apane sanghathan main bane rahen magar saket bahuguna ke paas ek shandaar mauka he virodhiyon ko jawaab dene kaa or apane sanghathan ko sandesh dene kaa ki ham hinsa nahin karenge
 It is expected that this talk of Saket Bahuguna will reach the ministers and mps who were looking for those who corrupted Gurmehar's mind
 uske ek saal puraane video ke aadhaar par uski deshbhakti yaa samadh ko chunauti de rahe the
 The representative of any government may dislike the talk of the girls but cannot challenge their understanding or independent thinking
 baharhaal ab gurmeher ne khud ko aage kii kaarywahi se alag karte hue bayaan diya he ki, 'I am separating myself from the campaign
 aap sabhi ko badhai
 Leave me alone mujhe jo kahana tha wo maine kah diya
 One thing that is certain is that now we will think twice before committing violence or threatening someone, and so i was opposed
 ye campan chaatro ke liye he, mere liye nahin
 Participate in large numbers in March, whoever is questioning my courage and bravery
 unke liye kahuungi ki maine zarurat se zyaada himmat dikhaai he
 ' gurmeher cor ne apana kaam kar diya he
 Many girls have voiced with them and even before them
 hamane kuch noujvaan ladakiyon se poocha ki jab wo bolti hai, pehali baar bolti hai yaa baar baar bolti hai to unke aas paas kaa samaaj unke saath kis tarah kaa bartaav karata he
 With what fear does she first liberate herself, and when she is free, how can she speak and which scares someone
 koun hai jo ladakiyon ke bolne par kehete hai ki bahut bolti ho, bologi to dekh lenaa, aaj ke prime time kaa makasad iske jawaab main un ladakiyon ko samaane laana he jo bolti hai, taaki aap unhen dekh saken
 Surely she should not get any benefit due to being a girl, her talk should be opposed on the basis of arguments
 bahes honi chahie lekin jab koi kisi ladki ko chup karaaye to uski baat ke liye na sahi, uski himmat ke liye uskaa saath dena chahie
 Honey, a student of Miranda House, has sent us a video in which she is saying, 'everyone should raise their voice, not me or who will raise their voice
 ' ladakiyon ke liye kitni hidaayat hoti he phir bhi koi na koi aage aati he bolne ke liye
 His family is requested not to be afraid too much
 siddhi kahati hai ki jab bhi unke saath kii ladkiyaan bolne ko hoti hai unhen suraksha kii yaad dilaakar chup kara diya jaataa he
 Who are those people who become a threat when a girl speaks? uski baat kaa virodh kiijie
 Disagree but who are the people who say it, that they say will not be okay
 kya aisi awaz kursi par baithe logon se bhi aa rahi he
 Somewhere you do not support such people who talk about seeing girls when they speak
 samaaj se lekar tamaam sarkaron main aise logon kii kami nahin hai
 Yamini Dixit is one such student who wants to share her speaking experience with you
 yamini uniwarsity main ek aisi jagah ke liye lard rahi he jahaan kisi bhi tarah kaa matbhed baatcheet ke zariye suljhaayaa ja sake
 How the fights took place in Ramjas College, who threw stones, what the police were doing, it is being investigated and there will never be a result
 isliye prime time main hamaara makasad us jhagade ke kaarnon yaa paksh vipaksh main janaa nahin he
 We are trying to see in the context of the controversy over Gurmehar what happens to a girl when she speaks
 wo bolne se pehle khud se kaise ladati he, jab wo bolti he to usase duniya kaise ladati he
 We are talking that the responsibility of ending the fear of violence is as much as abvp's responsibility to AISA, the police and university have the most accountability for both of them
 hamane in ladakiyon se sahmati lee he, unhone bhi himmat dikhaai he ki ve bolne ke halaat par bolengi
 The government will not decide the way of protest in the world
 log tay karenge
 Now see, the Prime Minister started Mann Ki Baat
 iske jawaab main congress ke netaa sandip dikshit ne kaam kii baat shuru kar di
 They also question the Prime Minister about the work through radio and put it on the Internet
 is tarah se loktantr faltaa phulata he
 Different sounds are heard
 in awaazon ke bich hi aap kisi ko pradhanmantri chunate hai or kisi ko nahin chunate hai
 Aditi from Miranda House says, 'I don't belong to any organization
 agar kisi ko kuch pasand nahin tha to unhen shantipurna pradarshan karnaa chahie
 He has many people afraid to write on social media
 ve raajnneeti se bhaagane lage hai
 This is not good for politics
 unhen kyon lagata he ki gaali dene waalon kaa giroh anaap shanaap likhane lagegaa
 Check the profile of your abuser
 dekhiye ki ve kis raajnneetik dal ke samarthak hai
 whatsapp is being spread in the name of information nowadays
 anaap shanaap afvaahen hai
 The whole system is engaged in defaming someone inside
 shaayad inhen sab vajahon se khaskar aam mahilaayein likhane se ghabraati hai
 What kind of things have been written on Gurmehar's post too
 police ne maamla to darj kiya he
 Let's see what happens
 mangalvaar ko dilli vishvavidhyalay main ek march hua
 This march was organized by students and teachers
 isa sanghathan bhi shaamil tha
 In this March, Sarvapriya Sangwan spoke to girls who are not from any organization but came against the politics of violence
 ummid he ki college prashasan aisi bolne vaali ladakiyon ko pareshaan nahin karegaa balki unhen ek patr jari karegaa ki aapane shantipurna pradarshan main hissaa lekar college kaa naam raushan kiya he
 Such a letter should be given to the principal of the college
 abivipi ke sadasyon ko bhi dena chahie or isa waalon ko bhi
 And also those students who are not from any organization like Aditi
 nidikshma sharma ramajas kii chaatra hai
 She says, 'we saw how our university turned into Riot Place
 ye baat rakhane ke liye hoti he
 It is important to protest because they want to scare us
 ' What kind of society are we letting on social media where girls have to think while speaking that there is danger? ghar se niklo to khatara, ghar main rahakar duniya se bolo tab bhi khatara
 When the tongue is not left, the daughters will save for whom
 kya sankhyikee vibhaag or mahila kalyaan vibhaag ke aankadon ke liye bachengi
 There are many girls who are combating these abusive gangs
 aane vaale vakt main unka yogadan yaad kiya jayega
 Remember one thing that abuses
 sarkarein or raajnneetik dal unka istemaal kar chhod denge
 Whatever they write on social media, they can take the name of any leader but in society they will never be able to tell that they write abuses in support of any political party
 logon ko dhamkaate hai
 Pranjal, a student, said, 'at first i did not want to come to this Protest because my parents were very worried
 aisa nahin he ki wo abivipi ko saport karte hai, lekin wo abivipi se darate hai ki kahin wo mujhe kuch na kar den
 Like Pranjal, Sarvapriya got a school student in Delhi University in March
 aditi
 She was with Pranjal
 aditi ne kaha ki dar unka hathiyaar ho gaya he or ladakiyon ke liye virodh karnaa zyaada zaruri he kyonki unhen bolaa jaataa he ki tum kamazor ho
 The comments duniya main tarah tarah ke virodh pradarshan ho rahe hai
 What a tremendous movement in India for the entry of women into the Haji Ali Dargah and the Shani Temple
 mahilaon ne yah andolan chalaaya
 Not to take votes in the name of your question but to change the society
 aapako nikita azaad yaad he
 Nikita of Patiala started the napkin movement alone
 nikita ne sabarimala mandir ke trustee ko patr likh diya ki main bees saal kii ladki hum, mere aankh, kaan, naak, hont, haath, paanv sab hai jaise duusare insaanon ke hai
 i am a woman who has menstruation
 maine maa ko kehete suna he ki aise samay main mandiron main nahin janaa chahie
 a woman is impure
 nikita ke is patr ne desh main hangaamaa machaa diya jisamen usne sabarimala waalon se poocha tha ki maahvaaree ke samay auraton ko mandir aane se kyon roka ja rahaa he
 He raised this question alone
 congress bijepi ke manch se nahin uthaaya
 The breath of the leaders of these parties will swell
 isliye zaruri he ki koi akele bhi awaz uthaae
 When someone does this, then we support
 awaz uthaane vaale se sawaal bhi karen
 Nikita was also questioned but it is not right to scare her
 ladkiyaan awaz uthaa rahi hai
 Do not support those who kill them in private or in the crowd for any reason
 ho saktaa he ki bheed ke paas sabase sahi tark hon, kaaran hon magar wo adaalat nahin he
 That is not the law
 sahi baat ke liye sadak par faisla karne kaa adhikaar uske paas nahin he
 This is not the case with the syllabus of chemistry
 aam zindagi ke silebus main he
 Can understand without going to school
 sarkaron ke paas takat bahut hoti he
 When we and you forget this incident, it will find a way out
 gurmeher cor kaa samarthan dene vaale shikshakon ko pareshaan karegi
 Will send notice unke register check karavaaegi
 Many teachers neither speak for themselves nor for their students
 bahut se shikshak is desh main dahez lekar shaadi karte hai or shikshak diwas ke din devtaa banakar ghoomte hai
 For such teachers, i am reading the names of those teachers who have supported Gurmehar
 janet lalwampui, nangoum maheshakanta singh, maitreyi mandal, jonthan vagchz, rachita mittal, shernaz kama, aarti minocha, ruyeesana shrauf, madhu grover, vafaa hamid, reeta joshi, maaya joshi, tania sachdev, mitali mishra, arunima re, dipti nath, karunaa rajeev, tania sachdev
 Be prepared for a story of how the supporting teachers were harassed
 ek teacher ko apni chaatra kaa saath nahin dena chahie to kya karnaa chahie, khaskar tab jab uske kilaaf mantri or saansad bol rahe hon
 On Twitter, he is being threatened with rape and abuses in writing
 maan lijie ki aapaki beti vahaan padhati ho to teacher ko kya karnaa chahie
 In this sense, it is a big deal
 abivipi ne somvaar ko apni taraf se tirangaa yatra kaa aayojan kiya tha
 BJP leader Shaina NC has said that there should be a debate on whoever is in trouble

 Unfortunately Gurmehar ji is blaming our organization ABVP but i want to make it clear that none of our liabilities are involved in this
 der se hi sahi, saket bahuguna ne acha kaam kiya he
 Saket should also tell Kiren Rijiju that you should support Gurmehar, protect because she is alone
 bhale hi usne hamaara virodh kiya he
 Still, Saket did as much as he has
 saket ko ab un tasveeron ko dekhnaa chahie jisamen uske sanghathan ke log hinsa karte dikhaaye gaye hai
 If they want, they can remove the members who commit violence
 bhale hi duusare gut ke hinsa karne vaale apane sanghathan main bane rahen magar saket bahuguna ke paas ek shandaar mauka he virodhiyon ko jawaab dene kaa or apane sanghathan ko sandesh dene kaa ki ham hinsa nahin karenge
 It is expected that this talk of Saket Bahuguna will reach the ministers and mps who were looking for those who corrupted Gurmehar's mind
 uske ek saal puraane video ke aadhaar par uski deshbhakti yaa samadh ko chunauti de rahe the
 The representative of any government may dislike the talk of the girls but cannot challenge their understanding or independent thinking

 sahi baat ke liye sadak par faisla karne kaa adhikaar uske paas nahin he
 This is not the case with the syllabus of chemistry
 aam zindagi ke silebus main he
 Can understand without going to school
 aisi story ke liye taiyaar rahiye ki samarthan karne vaale teacheron ko kaise pareshaan kiya gaya
 What should a teacher do to not support her student, especially when the minister and MP are speaking against her
 twitor par use balaatkaar karne kii dhamkiyaan di ja rahi hon or likhakar gaaliyaan di ja rahi hon
 Suppose your daughter studies there, what should the teacher do
 is lihaaz se ye badi baat he
 The ABVP organized a tricolor trip on its behalf on Monday
 bijepi netaa shina ensi ne kaha he ki jise bhi pareshaani he use lekar bahes honi chahie
 There should be no place for violence
 abivipi ke netaa saket bahuguna ne morris nagar thane main shikaayat darj karai he
 It has been said that through the media from all over the country and also in TV studios, it has been said that some people are threatening to kill and rape them on social media
 desh ke kisi bhi naagarik ko aisi dhamkiyaan milanaa galat he
 The police should take strong action against such elements
 durbhaagya se gurmeher ji hamaare sanghathan abivipi par aarope laga rahi hai lekin main saaf karnaa chahta hum ki hamaara koi bhi daayitvadharee isamen shaamil nahin he
 As of late, Saket Bahuguna has done a good job
 saket ko kiren rijiju se bhi kahana chahie ki aap gurmeher kaa saath dijie, suraksha kiijie kyonki wo akeli he
 Even though he has opposed us
 phir bhi jitna uske bas main he utana to saket ne kiya hi
 Saket should now look at the pictures in which the people of his organization are shown committing violence
 wo chahen to hinsa karne vaale sadasyon ko nikaal sakate hai
 Even though the violence of the other factions remains in their organization, Saket Bahuguna has a great chance to respond to the opponents and send a message to his organization that we will not commit violence
 ummid he saket bahuguna kii yah baat mantriyon or saansadon tak pahonchegi jo gurmeher ke dimaag ko dooshit karne waalon kaa pataa laga rahe the
 Based on his one year old video, he was challenging his patriotism
 kisi bhi sarkaar kaa numaayinda ladakiyon kii baat ko bhale naapsand kare magar uski samaj yaa swatantra soch ko chunauti nahin de saktaa he
 However, now Gurmehar has made a statement separating himself from further proceedings, 'main campan se khud ko alag kar rahi hum
 Congratulations to all of you
 mujhe akelaa chhod den
 i said what i had to say
 ek cheez jo nishchit he ki ab ham hinsa karne yaa kisi ko dhamkee dene se pehle do baar sochenge, or isliye meraa virodh tha
 This campaign is for students, not for me
 march main badi sankhya main hissaa len jo koi bhi mere saahas or bahaduree par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 i will say to them that i have shown more courage than i have
 ' Gurmehar Kaur has done her work
 unke saath or unke pehle bhi bahut si ladakiyon ne awaz uthaai he
 We asked some young girls how the society around them treats them when they speak, for the first time or they speak again and again
 ve pehle kis dar se khud ko azaad karti hai or jab azaad hoti hai to unka bolnaa kis tarah se or kis kis ko daraa detaa he
 Who are the girls who say that they speak a lot, if you speak, then see, the purpose of today's prime time is to bring the girls who speak in response, so that you can see them
 zarur ladki hone ke kaaran use koi phayda nahin milanaa chahie, uski baat kaa tarkon ke aadhaar virodh hona chahie
 There should be debate, but when someone silences a girl, it should not be right for her to speak, to support her for her courage
 miranda house kii chaatra hani ne ek video hamen bheja he jisamen wo kah rahi hai, 'sabko awaz uthaani chahie, main nahin ham nahin to koun awaz uthayega
 'there is so much instruction for girls, yet someone comes forward to speak
 inaki parivaar waalon se guzarish he ki itnaa bhi na daren
 Siddhi says that whenever girls accompanying her are to speak, they are reminded of safety and kept silent
 wo koun log hai jo ladki ke bolne par khatara ban jate hai
 Resist his point
 asahmat hoiye lekin use yah bolne vaale koun log hote hai jo kehete hai ki thik nahin hoga
 Is such a voice coming from people sitting in a chair
 kahin aap aise logon kaa samarthan to nahin karte jo ladakiyon ke bolne par dekh lene kii baat karte hai
 There is no dearth of such people from society to all governments
 yamini dikshit aisi hi ek chaatra hai jo bolne ke apane anubhav ko aapse saajha karnaa chaahati hai
 Yamini is fighting for a place in the university where any kind of differences can be resolved through dialogue
 ramajas college main jhagade kaise hue, pathar kisne phenke, police kya kar rahi thi, isaki jaanch ho rahi he or kabhi nateeja nahin aayega
 So in prime time our motive is not to go into the reasons or side opposition to that quarrel
 ham gurmeher ko lekar hue vivaad ke sandarbh main dekhne kii koshish kar rahe hai ki jab koi ladki bolti he to uske saath kya kya hota he
 How does she fight herself before speaking, how does the world fight her when she speaks
 ham baat kar rahe hai ki hinsa kaa dar samaapt karne kii zimmedaari jitna abivipi kii he utani hi isa kii he, in donon se sabase adhik javabdehi police or uniwarsity kii he
 We have taken consent from these girls, they have also shown courage that they will speak on the situation of speaking
 duniya main virodh kaa tarika sarkaar nahin tay karegi
 People will decide
 ab dekhiye pradhanmantri ne man kii baat shuru kii
 In response, Congress leader Sandeep Dixit started talking about work
 ve bhi radio ke zariye kaam kii baat main pradhanmantri se sawaal karte hai or internet par daal dete hai
 This is how democracy thrives
 tarah tarah kii awaazen sunai detii hai
 Between these voices, you choose someone as Prime Minister and you do not choose anyone
 miranda house kii aditi kahati hai, 'main kisi sanghathan kii nahin hum
 If someone did not like something, they should have a peaceful demonstration
 unke paas soshal media par bahut se log likhane se darate hai
 They are running away from politics
 yah raajnneeti ke liye acha nahin he
 Why do they think that the gang of abusers will start writing anonymously
 aap gaali dene waalon kii profile check kiijie
 See which political party they are supporters of
 whatsap aajkal soochna ke naam par kachra failaayaa ja rahaa he
 There are rumors of anonymity
 puraa tantra laga hua he kisi ko bheetar bheetar badnaam karne main
 Probably for all these reasons especially ordinary women are afraid to write
 gurmeher ke post par bhi kisi kisi baaten likhi gai hai
 The police has registered a case
 dekhte hai kya hota he
 On Tuesday, a march took place at Delhi University
 is march kaa aayojan chaatr or shikshakon ne kiya tha
 The AISA organization was also involved
 is march main sarvapriya sangwan ne un ladakiyon se baat kii jo kisi sanghathan kii to nahin hai magar hinsa kii raajnneeti ke virodh main ain thim
 Hopefully the college administration will not disturb such speaking girls but will issue a letter to them that you have brightened the name of the college by participating in a peaceful demonstration
 aisa patr college ke principal ko dena chahie
 It should be given to the members of ABVP and also to the people of AISA
 or un chaatro ko bhi jo kisi sanghathan se nahin hai jaise aditi
 Nidikshma Sharma is a student of Ramjas
 wo kahati hai, 'hamane dekha ki kaise hamaari uniwarsity rit place main badal gai
 This thing is meant to be kept
 virodh karnaa zaruri he kyonki wo hamen daraana chaahate hai
 ' soshal media par ham kaisaa samaaj banane de rahe hai jahaan ladakiyon ko bolte vakt sochna pade ki khatara to nahin he
 If you come out of the house then there is danger, stay at home and speak to the world even then there is danger jab jubaan hi nahin bachegi to betiyaan kiske liye bachengi

 Threaten people
 ek chaatra pranjal ne kaha, 'pehle main is protest main aana nahin chaahati thi kyonki mere parent bahut chintit the
 It is not that they support ABVP, but they are afraid of ABVP not to do anything to me
 pranjal kii tarah hi sarvapriya ko dilli vishvavidhyalay ke march main skool kii ek chaatra mili
 Aditi wo pranjal ke saath hi thi
 Aditi said that fear has become her weapon and it is more important for girls to protest because they are told that you are weak
 tippaniyan Various types of protests are taking place in the world
 bharat main hi haazi ali dargah or shani mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh ko lekar kitna jabardast andolan hua
 Women started this movement
 apane sawaal ke naam par vot lene ke liye nahin balki samaaj ko badalane ke liye
 You remember Nikita Azad
 patiala kii nikita ne akele napkin andolan kii shuruyaat kar di
 Nikita wrote a letter to the trustee of the Sabarimala temple that i am a twenty year old girl, my eyes, ears, nose, lips, hands, feet are all like other human beings
 main ek aurat hum jise maahvaaree hoti he
 i have heard mother say that one should not go to temples at such times
 aurat apavitra hoti he
 This letter from Nikita created uproar in the country in which she asked the Sabarimala people why women are being prevented from coming to the temple during menstruation
 yah sawaal usne akele uthaaya
 Congress did not lift from bjp's platform
 in dalon ke netaaon kii saansen phool jaaengi
 So it is important that someone should raise their voice alone
 jab koi aisa kare to ham saath den
 Also ask a voice person
 nikita se bhi sawaal hue magar use sawaal karne ke liye daraana thik nahin he
 Girls are raising their voices
 inhen akele main yaa bheed main kisi bhi kaaran se maarane waalon ko dhamkaane waalon kaa saath mat dijie
 It may be that the crowd has the right arguments, reasons, but it is not the court
 wo kanoon nahin he
 He does not have the right to decide on the road for the right thing
 yah baat chemistry ke silebus kaa nahin he
 Is in the syllabus of common life
 bina skool gaye samaj main aa sakati he
 The ABVP organized a tricolor trip on its behalf on Monday
 bijepi netaa shina ensi ne kaha he ki jise bhi pareshaani he use lekar bahes honi chahie
 There should be no place for violence
 abivipi ke netaa saket bahuguna ne morris nagar thane main shikaayat darj karai he
 It has been said that through the media from all over the country and also in TV studios, it has been said that some people are threatening to kill and rape them on social media
 desh ke kisi bhi naagarik ko aisi dhamkiyaan milanaa galat he
 The police should take strong action against such elements
 durbhaagya se gurmeher ji hamaare sanghathan abivipi par aarope laga rahi hai lekin main saaf karnaa chahta hum ki hamaara koi bhi daayitvadharee isamen shaamil nahin he
 As of late, Saket Bahuguna has done a good job
 saket ko kiren rijiju se bhi kahana chahie ki aap gurmeher kaa saath dijie, suraksha kiijie kyonki wo akeli he
 Even though he has opposed us
 phir bhi jitna uske bas main he utana to saket ne kiya hi
 Saket should now look at the pictures in which the people of his organization are shown committing violence
 wo chahen to hinsa karne vaale sadasyon ko nikaal sakate hai
 Even though the violence of the other factions remains in their organization, Saket Bahuguna has a great chance to respond to the opponents and send a message to his organization that we will not commit violence
 ummid he saket bahuguna kii yah baat mantriyon or saansadon tak pahonchegi jo gurmeher ke dimaag ko dooshit karne waalon kaa pataa laga rahe the
 Based on his one year old video, he was challenging his patriotism
 kisi bhi sarkaar kaa numaayinda ladakiyon kii baat ko bhale naapsand kare magar uski samaj yaa swatantra soch ko chunauti nahin de saktaa he
 However, now Gurmehar has made a statement separating himself from further proceedings, 'main campan se khud ko alag kar rahi hum
 Congratulations to all of you
 mujhe akelaa chhod den
 i said what i had to say
 ek cheez jo nishchit he ki ab ham hinsa karne yaa kisi ko dhamkee dene se pehle do baar sochenge, or isliye meraa virodh tha
 This campaign is for students, not for me
 march main badi sankhya main hissaa len jo koi bhi mere saahas or bahaduree par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 i will say to them that i have shown more courage than i have
 ' Gurmehar Kaur has done her work
 unke saath or unke pehle bhi bahut si ladakiyon ne awaz uthaai he
 We asked some young girls how the society around them treats them when they speak, for the first time or they speak again and again
 ve pehle kis dar se khud ko azaad karti hai or jab azaad hoti hai to unka bolnaa kis tarah se or kis kis ko daraa detaa he
 Who are the girls who say that they speak a lot, if you speak, then see, the purpose of today's prime time is to bring the girls who speak in response, so that you can see them
 zarur ladki hone ke kaaran use koi phayda nahin milanaa chahie, uski baat kaa tarkon ke aadhaar virodh hona chahie
 There should be debate, but when someone silences a girl, it should not be right for her to speak, to support her for her courage
 miranda house kii chaatra hani ne ek video hamen bheja he jisamen wo kah rahi hai, 'sabko awaz uthaani chahie, main nahin ham nahin to koun awaz uthayega
 'there is so much instruction for girls, yet someone comes forward to speak
 inaki parivaar waalon se guzarish he ki itnaa bhi na daren
 Siddhi says that whenever girls accompanying her are to speak, they are reminded of safety and kept silent
 wo koun log hai jo ladki ke bolne par khatara ban jate hai
 Resist his point
 asahmat hoiye lekin use yah bolne vaale koun log hote hai jo kehete hai ki thik nahin hoga
 Is such a voice coming from people sitting in a chair
 kahin aap aise logon kaa samarthan to nahin karte jo ladakiyon ke bolne par dekh lene kii baat karte hai
 There is no dearth of such people from society to all governments
 yamini dikshit aisi hi ek chaatra hai jo bolne ke apane anubhav ko aapse saajha karnaa chaahati hai
 Yamini is fighting for a place in the university where any kind of differences can be resolved through dialogue
 ramajas college main jhagade kaise hue, pathar kisne phenke, police kya kar rahi thi, isaki jaanch ho rahi he or kabhi nateeja nahin aayega
 So in prime time our motive is not to go into the reasons or side opposition to that quarrel
 ham gurmeher ko lekar hue vivaad ke sandarbh main dekhne kii koshish kar rahe hai ki jab koi ladki bolti he to uske saath kya kya hota he
 How does she fight herself before speaking, how does the world fight her when she speaks
 ham baat kar rahe hai ki hinsa kaa dar samaapt karne kii zimmedaari jitna abivipi kii he utani hi isa kii he, in donon se sabase adhik javabdehi police or uniwarsity kii he
 We have taken consent from these girls, they have also shown courage that they will speak on the situation of speaking
 duniya main virodh kaa tarika sarkaar nahin tay karegi
 People will decide
 ab dekhiye pradhanmantri ne man kii baat shuru kii
 In response, Congress leader Sandeep Dixit started talking about work
 ve bhi radio ke zariye kaam kii baat main pradhanmantri se sawaal karte hai or internet par daal dete hai
 This is how democracy thrives
 tarah tarah kii awaazen sunai detii hai
 Between these voices, you choose someone as Prime Minister and you do not choose anyone
 miranda house kii aditi kahati hai, 'main kisi sanghathan kii nahin hum
 If someone did not like something, they should have a peaceful demonstration
 unke paas soshal media par bahut se log likhane se darate hai
 They are running away from politics
 yah raajnneeti ke liye acha nahin he
 Why do they think that the gang of abusers will start writing anonymously
 aap gaali dene waalon kii profile check kiijie
 See which political party they are supporters of
 whatsap aajkal soochna ke naam par kachra failaayaa ja rahaa he
 There are rumors of anonymity
 puraa tantra laga hua he kisi ko bheetar bheetar badnaam karne main
 Probably for all these reasons especially ordinary women are afraid to write
 gurmeher ke post par bhi kisi kisi baaten likhi gai hai
 The police has registered a case
 dekhte hai kya hota he
 On Tuesday, a march took place at Delhi University
 is march kaa aayojan chaatr or shikshakon ne kiya tha
 The AISA organization was also involved
 is march main sarvapriya sangwan ne un ladakiyon se baat kii jo kisi sanghathan kii to nahin hai magar hinsa kii raajnneeti ke virodh main ain thim
 Hopefully the college administration will not disturb such speaking girls but will issue a letter to them that you have brightened the name of the college by participating in a peaceful demonstration
 aisa patr college ke principal ko dena chahie
 It should be given to the members of ABVP and also to the people of AISA
 or un chaatro ko bhi jo kisi sanghathan se nahin hai jaise aditi
 Nidikshma Sharma is a student of Ramjas
 wo kahati hai, 'hamane dekha ki kaise hamaari uniwarsity rit place main badal gai
 This thing is meant to be kept
 virodh karnaa zaruri he kyonki wo hamen daraana chaahate hai
 ' soshal media par ham kaisaa samaaj banane de rahe hai jahaan ladakiyon ko bolte vakt sochna pade ki khatara to nahin he
 If you come out of the house then there is danger, stay at home and speak to the world even then there is danger jab jubaan hi nahin bachegi to betiyaan kiske liye bachengi
 Will the statistics department and women's welfare department survive for data
 bahut si ladkiyaan hai jo in gaali dene vaale girohon kaa muqabla kar rahi hai
 His contribution will be remembered in times to come
 gaali dene vaale ek baat yaad rakhen

 It is expected that this talk of Saket Bahuguna will reach the ministers and mps who were looking for those who corrupted Gurmehar's mind
 uske ek saal puraane video ke aadhaar par uski deshbhakti yaa samadh ko chunauti de rahe the
 The representative of any government may dislike the talk of the girls but cannot challenge their understanding or independent thinking
 baharhaal ab gurmeher ne khud ko aage kii kaarywahi se alag karte hue bayaan diya he ki, 'I am separating myself from the campaign
 aap sabhi ko badhai
 Leave me alone mujhe jo kahana tha wo maine kah diya
 One thing that is certain is that now we will think twice before committing violence or threatening someone, and so i was opposed
 ye campan chaatro ke liye he, mere liye nahin
 Participate in large numbers in March, whoever is questioning my courage and bravery
 unke liye kahuungi ki maine zarurat se zyaada himmat dikhaai he
 ' gurmeher cor ne apana kaam kar diya he
 Many girls have voiced with them and even before them
 hamane kuch noujvaan ladakiyon se poocha ki jab wo bolti hai, pehali baar bolti hai yaa baar baar bolti hai to unke aas paas kaa samaaj unke saath kis tarah kaa bartaav karata he
 With what fear does she first liberate herself, and when she is free, how can she speak and which scares someone
 koun hai jo ladakiyon ke bolne par kehete hai ki bahut bolti ho, bologi to dekh lenaa, aaj ke prime time kaa makasad iske jawaab main un ladakiyon ko samaane laana he jo bolti hai, taaki aap unhen dekh saken
 Surely she should not get any benefit due to being a girl, her talk should be opposed on the basis of arguments
 bahes honi chahie lekin jab koi kisi ladki ko chup karaaye to uski baat ke liye na sahi, uski himmat ke liye uskaa saath dena chahie
 Honey, a student of Miranda House, has sent us a video in which she is saying, 'everyone should raise their voice, not me or who will raise their voice
 ' ladakiyon ke liye kitni hidaayat hoti he phir bhi koi na koi aage aati he bolne ke liye
 His family is requested not to be afraid too much
 siddhi kahati hai ki jab bhi unke saath kii ladkiyaan bolne ko hoti hai unhen suraksha kii yaad dilaakar chup kara diya jaataa he
 Who are those people who become a threat when a girl speaks? uski baat kaa virodh kiijie
 Disagree but who are the people who say it, that they say will not be okay
 kya aisi awaz kursi par baithe logon se bhi aa rahi he
 Somewhere you do not support such people who talk about seeing girls when they speak
 samaaj se lekar tamaam sarkaron main aise logon kii kami nahin hai
 Yamini Dixit is one such student who wants to share her speaking experience with you
 yamini uniwarsity main ek aisi jagah ke liye lard rahi he jahaan kisi bhi tarah kaa matbhed baatcheet ke zariye suljhaayaa ja sake
 How the fights took place in Ramjas College, who threw stones, what the police were doing, it is being investigated and there will never be a result
 isliye prime time main hamaara makasad us jhagade ke kaarnon yaa paksh vipaksh main janaa nahin he
 We are trying to see in the context of the controversy over Gurmehar what happens to a girl when she speaks
 wo bolne se pehle khud se kaise ladati he, jab wo bolti he to usase duniya kaise ladati he
 We are talking that the responsibility of ending the fear of violence is as much as abvp's responsibility to AISA, the police and university have the most accountability for both of them
 hamane in ladakiyon se sahmati lee he, unhone bhi himmat dikhaai he ki ve bolne ke halaat par bolengi
 The government will not decide the way of protest in the world
 log tay karenge
 Now see, the Prime Minister started Mann Ki Baat
 iske jawaab main congress ke netaa sandip dikshit ne kaam kii baat shuru kar di
 They also question the Prime Minister about the work through radio and put it on the Internet
 is tarah se loktantr faltaa phulata he
 Different sounds are heard
 in awaazon ke bich hi aap kisi ko pradhanmantri chunate hai or kisi ko nahin chunate hai
 Aditi from Miranda House says, 'I don't belong to any organization
 agar kisi ko kuch pasand nahin tha to unhen shantipurna pradarshan karnaa chahie
 He has many people afraid to write on social media
 ve raajnneeti se bhaagane lage hai
 This is not good for politics
 unhen kyon lagata he ki gaali dene waalon kaa giroh anaap shanaap likhane lagegaa
 Check the profile of your abuser
 dekhiye ki ve kis raajnneetik dal ke samarthak hai
 whatsapp is being spread in the name of information nowadays
 anaap shanaap afvaahen hai
 The whole system is engaged in defaming someone inside
 shaayad inhen sab vajahon se khaskar aam mahilaayein likhane se ghabraati hai
 What kind of things have been written on Gurmehar's post too
 police ne maamla to darj kiya he
 Let's see what happens
 mangalvaar ko dilli vishvavidhyalay main ek march hua
 This march was organized by students and teachers
 isa sanghathan bhi shaamil tha
 In this March, Sarvapriya Sangwan spoke to girls who are not from any organization but came against the politics of violence
 ummid he ki college prashasan aisi bolne vaali ladakiyon ko pareshaan nahin karegaa balki unhen ek patr jari karegaa ki aapane shantipurna pradarshan main hissaa lekar college kaa naam raushan kiya he
 Such a letter should be given to the principal of the college
 abivipi ke sadasyon ko bhi dena chahie or isa waalon ko bhi
 And also those students who are not from any organization like Aditi
 nidikshma sharma ramajas kii chaatra hai
 She says, 'we saw how our university turned into Riot Place
 ye baat rakhane ke liye hoti he
 It is important to protest because they want to scare us
 ' What kind of society are we letting on social media where girls have to think while speaking that there is danger? ghar se niklo to khatara, ghar main rahakar duniya se bolo tab bhi khatara
 When the tongue is not left, the daughters will save for whom
 kya sankhyikee vibhaag or mahila kalyaan vibhaag ke aankadon ke liye bachengi
 There are many girls who are combating these abusive gangs
 aane vaale vakt main unka yogadan yaad kiya jayega
 Remember one thing that abuses
 sarkarein or raajnneetik dal unka istemaal kar chhod denge
 Whatever they write on social media, they can take the name of any leader but in society they will never be able to tell that they write abuses in support of any political party
 logon ko dhamkaate hai
 Pranjal, a student, said, 'at first i did not want to come to this Protest because my parents were very worried
 aisa nahin he ki wo abivipi ko saport karte hai, lekin wo abivipi se darate hai ki kahin wo mujhe kuch na kar den
 Like Pranjal, Sarvapriya got a school student in Delhi University in March
 aditi
 She was with Pranjal
 aditi ne kaha ki dar unka hathiyaar ho gaya he or ladakiyon ke liye virodh karnaa zyaada zaruri he kyonki unhen bolaa jaataa he ki tum kamazor ho
 The comments duniya main tarah tarah ke virodh pradarshan ho rahe hai
 What a tremendous movement in India for the entry of women into the Haji Ali Dargah and the Shani Temple
 mahilaon ne yah andolan chalaaya
 Not to take votes in the name of your question but to change the society
 aapako nikita azaad yaad he
 Nikita of Patiala started the napkin movement alone
 nikita ne sabarimala mandir ke trustee ko patr likh diya ki main bees saal kii ladki hum, mere aankh, kaan, naak, hont, haath, paanv sab hai jaise duusare insaanon ke hai
 i am a woman who has menstruation
 maine maa ko kehete suna he ki aise samay main mandiron main nahin janaa chahie
 a woman is impure
 nikita ke is patr ne desh main hangaamaa machaa diya jisamen usne sabarimala waalon se poocha tha ki maahvaaree ke samay auraton ko mandir aane se kyon roka ja rahaa he
 He raised this question alone
 congress bijepi ke manch se nahin uthaaya
 The breath of the leaders of these parties will swell
 isliye zaruri he ki koi akele bhi awaz uthaae
 When someone does this, then we support
 awaz uthaane vaale se sawaal bhi karen
 Nikita was also questioned but it is not right to scare her
 ladkiyaan awaz uthaa rahi hai
 Do not support those who kill them in private or in the crowd for any reason
 ho saktaa he ki bheed ke paas sabase sahi tark hon, kaaran hon magar wo adaalat nahin he
 That is not the law
 sahi baat ke liye sadak par faisla karne kaa adhikaar uske paas nahin he
 This is not the case with the syllabus of chemistry
 aam zindagi ke silebus main he
 Can understand without going to school
 gurmeher cor ne apana kaam kar diya he

 Siddhi says that whenever girls accompanying her are to speak, they are reminded of safety and kept silent
 wo koun log hai jo ladki ke bolne par khatara ban jate hai
 Resist his point
 asahmat hoiye lekin use yah bolne vaale koun log hote hai jo kehete hai ki thik nahin hoga
 Is such a voice coming from people sitting in a chair
 kahin aap aise logon kaa samarthan to nahin karte jo ladakiyon ke bolne par dekh lene kii baat karte hai
 There is no dearth of such people from society to all governments
 yamini dikshit aisi hi ek chaatra hai jo bolne ke apane anubhav ko aapse saajha karnaa chaahati hai
 Yamini is fighting for a place in the university where any kind of differences can be resolved through dialogue
 ramajas college main jhagade kaise hue, pathar kisne phenke, police kya kar rahi thi, isaki jaanch ho rahi he or kabhi nateeja nahin aayega
 So in prime time our motive is not to go into the reasons or side opposition to that quarrel
 ham gurmeher ko lekar hue vivaad ke sandarbh main dekhne kii koshish kar rahe hai ki jab koi ladki bolti he to uske saath kya kya hota he
 How does she fight herself before speaking, how does the world fight her when she speaks
 ham baat kar rahe hai ki hinsa kaa dar samaapt karne kii zimmedaari jitna abivipi kii he utani hi isa kii he, in donon se sabase adhik javabdehi police or uniwarsity kii he
 We have taken consent from these girls, they have also shown courage that they will speak on the situation of speaking
 duniya main virodh kaa tarika sarkaar nahin tay karegi
 People will decide
 ab dekhiye pradhanmantri ne man kii baat shuru kii
 In response, Congress leader Sandeep Dixit started talking about work
 ve bhi radio ke zariye kaam kii baat main pradhanmantri se sawaal karte hai or internet par daal dete hai
 This is how democracy thrives
 tarah tarah kii awaazen sunai detii hai
 Between these voices, you choose someone as Prime Minister and you do not choose anyone
 miranda house kii aditi kahati hai, 'main kisi sanghathan kii nahin hum
 If someone did not like something, they should have a peaceful demonstration
 unke paas soshal media par bahut se log likhane se darate hai
 They are running away from politics
 yah raajnneeti ke liye acha nahin he
 Why do they think that the gang of abusers will start writing anonymously
 aap gaali dene waalon kii profile check kiijie
 See which political party they are supporters of
 whatsap aajkal soochna ke naam par kachra failaayaa ja rahaa he
 There are rumors of anonymity
 puraa tantra laga hua he kisi ko bheetar bheetar badnaam karne main
 Probably for all these reasons especially ordinary women are afraid to write
 gurmeher ke post par bhi kisi kisi baaten likhi gai hai
 The police has registered a case
 dekhte hai kya hota he
 On Tuesday, a march took place at Delhi University
 is march kaa aayojan chaatr or shikshakon ne kiya tha
 The AISA organization was also involved
 is march main sarvapriya sangwan ne un ladakiyon se baat kii jo kisi sanghathan kii to nahin hai magar hinsa kii raajnneeti ke virodh main ain thim
 Hopefully the college administration will not disturb such speaking girls but will issue a letter to them that you have brightened the name of the college by participating in a peaceful demonstration
 aisa patr college ke principal ko dena chahie
 It should be given to the members of ABVP and also to the people of AISA

 If you come out of the house then there is danger, stay at home and speak to the world even then there is danger jab jubaan hi nahin bachegi to betiyaan kiske liye bachengi
 Will the statistics department and women's welfare department survive for data
 bahut si ladkiyaan hai jo in gaali dene vaale girohon kaa muqabla kar rahi hai

 ek chaatra pranjal ne kaha, 'pehle main is protest main aana nahin chaahati thi kyonki mere parent bahut chintit the
 It is not that they support ABVP, but they are afraid of ABVP not to do anything to me
 pranjal kii tarah hi sarvapriya ko dilli vishvavidhyalay ke march main skool kii ek chaatra mili
 Aditi wo pranjal ke saath hi thi
 Aditi said that fear has become her weapon and it is more important for girls to protest because they are told that you are weak
 tippaniyan Various types of protests are taking place in the world
 bharat main hi haazi ali dargah or shani mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh ko lekar kitna jabardast andolan hua
 Women started this movement
 apane sawaal ke naam par vot lene ke liye nahin balki samaaj ko badalane ke liye
 You remember Nikita Azad
 patiala kii nikita ne akele napkin andolan kii shuruyaat kar di
 Nikita wrote a letter to the trustee of the Sabarimala temple that i am a twenty year old girl, my eyes, ears, nose, lips, hands, feet are all like other human beings
 main ek aurat hum jise maahvaaree hoti he
 i have heard mother say that one should not go to temples at such times
 aurat apavitra hoti he
 This letter from Nikita created uproar in the country in which she asked the Sabarimala people why women are being prevented from coming to the temple during menstruation
 yah sawaal usne akele uthaaya
 Congress did not lift from bjp's platform
 in dalon ke netaaon kii saansen phool jaaengi
 So it is important that someone should raise their voice alone
 jab koi aisa kare to ham saath den
 Also ask a voice person
 nikita se bhi sawaal hue magar use sawaal karne ke liye daraana thik nahin he
 Girls are raising their voices
 inhen akele main yaa bheed main kisi bhi kaaran se maarane waalon ko dhamkaane waalon kaa saath mat dijie
 It may be that the crowd has the right arguments, reasons, but it is not the court

 You remember Nikita Azad
 patiala kii nikita ne akele napkin andolan kii shuruyaat kar di
 Nikita wrote a letter to the trustee of the Sabarimala temple that i am a twenty year old girl, my eyes, ears, nose, lips, hands, feet are all like other human beings
 main ek aurat hum jise maahvaaree hoti he
 i have heard mother say that one should not go to temples at such times

 This letter from Nikita created uproar in the country in which she asked the Sabarimala people why women are being prevented from coming to the temple during menstruation
 yah sawaal usne akele uthaaya
 Congress did not lift from bjp's platform
 in dalon ke netaaon kii saansen phool jaaengi
 So it is important that someone should raise their voice alone
 jab koi aisa kare to ham saath den
 Also ask a voice person
 nikita se bhi sawaal hue magar use sawaal karne ke liye daraana thik nahin he
 Girls are raising their voices
 inhen akele main yaa bheed main kisi bhi kaaran se maarane waalon ko dhamkaane waalon kaa saath mat dijie
 It may be that the crowd has the right arguments, reasons, but it is not the court
 wo kanoon nahin he
 He does not have the right to decide on the road for the right thing
 yah baat chemistry ke silebus kaa nahin he
 Is in the syllabus of common life
 bina skool gaye samaj main aa sakati he
 The government will not decide the way of protest in the world
 log tay karenge
 Now see, the Prime Minister started Mann Ki Baat
 iske jawaab main congress ke netaa sandip dikshit ne kaam kii baat shuru kar di
 They also question the Prime Minister about the work through radio and put it on the Internet
 is tarah se loktantr faltaa phulata he
 Different sounds are heard
 in awaazon ke bich hi aap kisi ko pradhanmantri chunate hai or kisi ko nahin chunate hai
 Aditi from Miranda House says, 'I don't belong to any organization
 agar kisi ko kuch pasand nahin tha to unhen shantipurna pradarshan karnaa chahie
 He has many people afraid to write on social media
 ve raajnneeti se bhaagane lage hai
 This is not good for politics
 unhen kyon lagata he ki gaali dene waalon kaa giroh anaap shanaap likhane lagegaa
 Check the profile of your abuser
 dekhiye ki ve kis raajnneetik dal ke samarthak hai
 whatsapp is being spread in the name of information nowadays
 anaap shanaap afvaahen hai
 The whole system is engaged in defaming someone inside
 shaayad inhen sab vajahon se khaskar aam mahilaayein likhane se ghabraati hai
 What kind of things have been written on Gurmehar's post too
 police ne maamla to darj kiya he
 Let's see what happens
 mangalvaar ko dilli vishvavidhyalay main ek march hua
 This march was organized by students and teachers
 isa sanghathan bhi shaamil tha
 In this March, Sarvapriya Sangwan spoke to girls who are not from any organization but came against the politics of violence
 ummid he ki college prashasan aisi bolne vaali ladakiyon ko pareshaan nahin karegaa balki unhen ek patr jari karegaa ki aapane shantipurna pradarshan main hissaa lekar college kaa naam raushan kiya he
 Such a letter should be given to the principal of the college
 abivipi ke sadasyon ko bhi dena chahie or isa waalon ko bhi
 And also those students who are not from any organization like Aditi
 nidikshma sharma ramajas kii chaatra hai
 She says, 'we saw how our university turned into Riot Place
 ye baat rakhane ke liye hoti he
 It is important to protest because they want to scare us
 ' What kind of society are we letting on social media where girls have to think while speaking that there is danger? ghar se niklo to khatara, ghar main rahakar duniya se bolo tab bhi khatara
 When the tongue is not left, the daughters will save for whom
 kya sankhyikee vibhaag or mahila kalyaan vibhaag ke aankadon ke liye bachengi
 There are many girls who are combating these abusive gangs
 aane vaale vakt main unka yogadan yaad kiya jayega
 Remember one thing that abuses
 sarkarein or raajnneetik dal unka istemaal kar chhod denge
 Whatever they write on social media, they can take the name of any leader but in society they will never be able to tell that they write abuses in support of any political party
 logon ko dhamkaate hai
 Pranjal, a student, said, 'at first i did not want to come to this Protest because my parents were very worried
 aisa nahin he ki wo abivipi ko saport karte hai, lekin wo abivipi se darate hai ki kahin wo mujhe kuch na kar den
 Like Pranjal, Sarvapriya got a school student in Delhi University in March
 aditi
 She was with Pranjal
 aditi ne kaha ki dar unka hathiyaar ho gaya he or ladakiyon ke liye virodh karnaa zyaada zaruri he kyonki unhen bolaa jaataa he ki tum kamazor ho
 The comments duniya main tarah tarah ke virodh pradarshan ho rahe hai
 What a tremendous movement in India for the entry of women into the Haji Ali Dargah and the Shani Temple
 mahilaon ne yah andolan chalaaya
 Not to take votes in the name of your question but to change the society
 aapako nikita azaad yaad he
 Nikita of Patiala started the napkin movement alone
 nikita ne sabarimala mandir ke trustee ko patr likh diya ki main bees saal kii ladki hum, mere aankh, kaan, naak, hont, haath, paanv sab hai jaise duusare insaanon ke hai
 i am a woman who has menstruation
 maine maa ko kehete suna he ki aise samay main mandiron main nahin janaa chahie
 a woman is impure
 nikita ke is patr ne desh main hangaamaa machaa diya jisamen usne sabarimala waalon se poocha tha ki maahvaaree ke samay auraton ko mandir aane se kyon roka ja rahaa he
 He raised this question alone
 congress bijepi ke manch se nahin uthaaya
 The breath of the leaders of these parties will swell
 isliye zaruri he ki koi akele bhi awaz uthaae
 When someone does this, then we support
 awaz uthaane vaale se sawaal bhi karen
 Nikita was also questioned but it is not right to scare her
 ladkiyaan awaz uthaa rahi hai
 Do not support those who kill them in private or in the crowd for any reason
 ho saktaa he ki bheed ke paas sabase sahi tark hon, kaaran hon magar wo adaalat nahin he
 That is not the law
 sahi baat ke liye sadak par faisla karne kaa adhikaar uske paas nahin he
 This is not the case with the syllabus of chemistry
 aam zindagi ke silebus main he
 Can understand without going to school
 miranda house kii aditi kahati hai, 'main kisi sanghathan kii nahin hum

 shodh main yah tathy bhi ubharkar aayaa ki purush or mahilaon ke naak main yah antar 11 saal kii aayu main spasht hona shuru ho jaataa he

 Internal and external organs of each person included in the research were continuously measured
 shodhakartaaon ne paaya ki 11 varsh kii avasthaa se pehle tak ladke or ladakiyon kii naak kaa aakaar ek tha
 But along with Tarunai, there was a difference in the shape of his nose
 halton ne apane shodh main kaha he, 'yahaan tak ki yadi purush or mahila ke sharir kaa aakaar ek hi ho, phir bhi purush kii naak mahila kii naak se badi hoti he
 'he also said that the results of this research may apply to other communities as well as European citizens, but it is too early to say until such facts are obtained through research

 unhone kaha ki saikadon varshon se logon kii chahat he ki jis bhagwaan ram ke aadarshon kaa anusaran karke manushya apane jivan path par chalata he vahi ram aaj bhi tent main rah rahe hai
 We residents of Janakpur are very unhappy with this, Sita ji who thrives in the palace has no place in Ayodhya
 aise main supreme court se ummid he ki faisla mandir banane ke paksh hi main aayega
 Janakpur is the place where Sita Mata's childhood was spent
 yahi wo jagah he jahaan swanyambar hua or siya ko ram mili
 The people of Janakpur, barely 20 km from the Bihar border and 60 km from Sitamarhi, the light spot of Mata Sita, are quite curious
 sita mata ke mandir main badi bhakton kii bheedsupreme court ke faisle ko lekar aam aadmi se lekar raajnneetik dal ke netaa tak, sabaki yahi chahat he ki yodhya main ram mandir kaa bhavy nirmaan ho
 Ever since the Supreme Court hearing on the case in Ayodhya, since that day the crowd of devotees has increased in the temple of Janak Dulari Sita Mata and everyone has the same belief that the decision of the Supreme Court will be in favor of building the temple
 kathmandu se darshan ke liye ai radha koirala kahati hai ki ram mandir bananaa chahie or ham chaahate hai ki jis prakaar ham sita mata kaa darshan karne janakapur aate hai usee tarah se ham yodhya bhagwaan ram kaa darshan karne jaaen
 This will further strengthen relations between India and Nepal
 nepal saamaajik or saanskriti rup se bharat se judaa hua he or bhagwaan ram kaa sasuraal janakapur nepal main hone se logon kii aasthaa ek dusre ke prati zyada he
 Rajiv Jha of Janakpur says that even today when someone comes here from Ayodhya, he is still treated like a son-in-law
 vaise bhi mithilanchal main satkar kii ek parampara rahi he
 According to Mahant Ram Roshanadas of the temple of Janjankapur Dham, the grand preparations for Vivaha Panchami, if the decision of the Supreme Court before Vivah Panchami is in favor of making the temple, then this time a grand Vivaha Panchami ceremony will be organized
 vaise to vivaah panchami har varsh manaai jaati he lekin har 5 varshon ke baad iskaa aayojan bhavy rup se hota he or sanyog ye he ki is varsh 21 disambar ko vivaah panchami kaa paanchvaan varsh hai
 In such a situation, the people of Janakpur are very hopeful that the decision will come in their favor
 mahanth ram raushan das bataate hai ki agar faisla paksh main aayaa to bharat ke kaaphi bade-bade log bhagwaan ram kii baraat ke saath yahaan aaenge or jaahir he ki samaaroh kaaphi bhavy hoga
 Janakpur is being painted in saffron color for this event
 puure shahar ko kesaria rang main isliye ranga ja rahaa he kyonki bhagwaan ram ko kesaria rang behad pasand he
 This is the reason why Lord Hanuman used to paint saffron color on his body
 janakapur upmahanagarapalika ke meyar lalkishor saah kehete hai ki puure shahar ko kesaria rang main rangane ke liye nagarpalika ke dwaara aam janata ko muft main kesaria rang uplabdh karaayaa ja rahaa he taaki janakapur dham aate hi log aasthaa ke rang main rang jaaen or ise safraun city ke naam se bhi jane

 When he was asked when he would get married, Salman turned back and asked whom he should marry and for how many days
 salamaanane kaha, 'ab shaadiyaan jindagi bhar ke liye nahin hotin
 Time has changed

 Salman has been avoiding the question of his marriage for a long time
 bhale hi unhone shaadi na kii ho, lekin 'kik' star katrina caff or jaclyn furnandis ke saath apane rishton ko lekar surkhiyon main rahe hai
 Prior to this, he has also dating Aishwarya Rai
 input:ians In Delhi, despite all efforts between the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress, there has not been an alliance
 ab donon partiyaan apane-apane dam par dilli kii sabhi saat loksabhaa siton par chunaav lard rahi hai
 Allegations are also going on in both the parties
 ab dilli ke mukhyamantri or aam aadmi party ke rashtriya sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne bataaya he ki unka congress ke saath gathbandhan kyon nahin ho paaya he
 In a special conversation with TV Today Network's consulting editor Rajdeep Sardesai, Arvind Kejriwal has claimed that the Congress President Rahul Gandhi had no intention, so the alliance has not been formed
 kejariwal ne bataaya ki aam aadmi party ne gathbandhan ko lekar puri koshish kii he, lekin congress ne apane kadam peeche khinch liye
 Arvind Kejriwal also kept the entire conversation with the Congress on the alliance
 kejariwal ne bataaya, 'desh ke saamne sabase bada mudda ye he ki kis tarah narendra modi or amit shah kii jodi se desh ko bachaaya ja sake
 That is why it was decided to have an alliance with the Congress'
 kejariwal ne bataaya ki pehle dilli, haryana, punjab or goa kii 33 siton par gathbandhan hone kii baat thi, lekin baad main yah dilli, haryana or chandigarh kii 18 siton tak pahunch gai
 Kejriwal claimed that the alliance had been decided on 18 seats, with a joint press conference scheduled to take place the next day
 lekin agle din congress netaaon ne phone uthaanaa band kar diya
 Arvind Kejriwal told that after the talks were decided on 18 seats, the Congress placed a condition on another seat in Haryana
 kejariwal ne kaha ki aam aadmi party ne congress kii yah shart bhi maan lee, jo ki naammumkin thi, lekin phir bhi congress ne kadam peeche kar liye
 Arvind Kejriwal also questioned the intentions of Rahul Gandhi, not Twitter, but talks that the Congress is responsible for the alliance
 kejariwal ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ne gathbandhan ke sambandh main twit kiya
 Kejriwal said that which alliance has happened on Twitter in the history of the world
 iskaa matlab ye he ki rahul gandhi dikhaa rahe the ki wo gathbandhan karnaa chaahate hai, lekin karnaa nahin chaahate the
 He said that alliances are from sit-down conversations, thus not on Twitter
 congress-aap ke gathbandhan se bijepi ko miltaa giftcongress se gathbandhan kii tamaam koshish karne ke baad jab yah gathjod nahin ho paaya to ab kejariwal daawa kar rahe hai ki agar gathbandhan ho bhi jaataa to congress apni siten nahin jeet paati
 Arvind Kejriwal said that in the three seats we were giving to the Congress, the Congress would face defeat
 is lihaaj se ye gathbandhan congress-aap kaa nahin, balki bijepi-aap kaa ho jaataa
 AAP had two options Arvind Kejriwal said that the Aam Aadmi Party had two options
 pehla vikalp ye tha ki 4-3 ke formule par gathbandhan ho jaae or congress ko di gai teen siten sidhe bijepi ko gift kar den
 The other option was that Aam Aadmi Party worked hard on seven seats and snatched all the seats from BJP
 kejariwal ne kaha ki aap ne doosraa vikalp chunaa he or dilli kii sabhi saat siton par wo jeetegi
 The Aam Aadmi Party is now contesting elections with this other option and the BJP and Congress are in front of it
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki dilli main 12 may ko jab matdaan hoga to dilli kii janata is trikoniya mukaable main kis par bharosa karti he

 anderworld main koharaam much gaya he
 Mumbai is being heated
 gangvaar kii kahaniyaan sunai ja rahi hai
 All this is happening due to the attack on a 'brother'
 
 
 navi mumbai kii jail main band anderworld don abu salem par jail ke andar goliyaan chalaai gayi
 Salem was shot two, but the bullet hit his finger and he survived
 haalanki is shootout ke baad di-company kii taraf se chota shakeel ne daawa kiya he ki salem par kaatilaanaa hamalaa usee ne karaayaa he
 But the police is also investigating the matter from the aspect that Abu Salem himself did not carry out this attack on himself to avoid punishment? When a face came on the underworld target in Mumbai on Thursday night, the corridors of the underworld i once again grew restless
 ye cheharaa daaud kaa nahin, daaud ke bhai iqbaal kaa bhi nahin, daaud ke dushman chota rajan kaa bhi nahin tha, balki daaud or chota rajan donon ke jaani dushman abu salem kaa tha
 So, targeting the target, there has been a panic in the underworld once
 nishane par bhale hi sirf abu salem tha, lekin daanv par puraa andrworld
 What is the reality behind this attack? Why is Abu Salem's life in danger? Who wants to reheat Mumbai? Is d-company behind the attack? Chhota Rajan wants to take revenge from Abu Salem or has Salem created a conspiracy to attack himself? Bharat Nepali gang shooter Devendra Jagtap aka JD was lodged in this jail
 us par ek vakil ke katl kaa iljaam he
 JD had gone to court on Tuesday in connection with this murder case
 jedy se court main mulaakaat ke liye uski bivi or teen saathi aae the
 Except for jd's lawyer, this was the last time these four people met him in court
 peshi ke baad jedy kareeb paune aath baje waapas taloja jail ke apane jeneral barrack main laut aada tha
 JD arrives in his barrack at eight o'clock after searching Jama to complete the entry drill
 uske barrack ke saath hi abu salem band tha
 At that time Salem was sitting in the barrack
 salem or daiji ke bich barrack main ek cardboard tha or kuch puraane akhbaar pade the
 At the same time, JD suddenly pulled out a revolver
 usne abu salem kaa nishaanaa lekar do goliyaan chalaayin
 Salem had been alerted by the time the first bullet missed the target
 lihaaza duusari goli jab chali to wo jhuk gaya
 This time the bullet was in the finger of his right hand
 isi bich jedy ne teesri goli chalaane kii koshish kii, magar goli revolver main hi funs gai or fire nahin ho sakaa
 By then, the prison guards and sentries had reached the barracks after hearing the sound of gunfire
 unhone jedy ko usee vakt daboch liya
 Abu Salem was immediately rushed to NMMC Hospital, then shifted to JJ Hospital in Mumbai at around two o'clock in the night, where after the operation, a bullet stuck in his finger was removed
 jail ke andar hue shootout main to salem batch gaya, lekin ab sawaal yah uth rahaa he ki aakhir ati surakshit jail main revolver or goli pahunchi kaise? police kii maane, to navi mumbai ke taloja jail main baahar se aane vaale har kaidi kii do baar talaashi hoti he
 One at the main gate and the other before entering the barrack
 lekin jedy donon hi baar talaashi main suraksha gardon ko aakhir kaise chakma de gaya? kahin isamen jail staff kii bhi to mileebhagat nahin he? vaise shuruaati jaanch ke baad jail ke chaar staff ko suspend kar diya gaya he
 In 2005, Portugal ceded Abu Salem to India on the condition that it would not sentence him to death for his crimes
 isi shart ke baad salem ko mumbai laayaa gaya or mumbai ke arthur road jail me band kar diya gaya
 But in 2010, inside Salem Road Jail, Abu Salem was attacked by the guilty of the 1993 Mumbai serial blast Mustafa Dosa
 isamen salem buree tarah jakhmi ho gaya tha
 After this, Salem was shifted from Arthur Road Jail to Taloja Jail in Navi Mumbai in 2010 itself
 yahaan salem ko shuruyaat main sabase surakshit anda cell main rakhaa gaya tha
 But then later shifted to General Barrack
 mumbai police ke mutabik mangalvaar ko jedy seshan court peshi ke liye gaya tha, tab usase uski patni ke alaava teen or log mili the
 The police suspect that the revolver was given to the Jedi by either of these four men
 jaahir he ki jail ke andar do-do jagah chakma dene kaa matlab he ki yaa to suraksha guard ne apni duty thik se nahin nibhaai yaa phir ye sajeesh kaa hissaa bhi ho saktaa he, isiilie philhal chaar logon ko suspend kar diya gaya he
 JD is said to belong to Santosh Shetty and Vijay Shetty's gang
 sutron ke mutabik salem or jedy ke bich kuch saptaah pehle phiroti ke paise ko lekar jhagada hua tha
 Then the Jedi threatened Salem
 sutron ke mutabik jab donon chota rajan ke liye kaam karte the, tab bhi paise ko lekar donon ke bich vivaad hua tha
 Salem later formed his own gang and joined JD Santosh Shetty and Bharat Shetty
 abu salem par hamale ke kuch hi der baad di-company kii taraf se daawa kiya gaya ki salem par hamalaa company ne karaayaa he
 According to sources, initially the JD himself also told the police
 magar phir baad main jedy lagaataar apane bayaan badalata rahaa
 However, according to Mumbai Police sources, it is also possible that Salem may have carried out the attack on Salem itself, as Salem could have a big benefit from this attack
 vaise sutron kii maane, to salem taloja jail se baahar nikalnaa chahta tha or usne jail prashasan se use uttar pradesh kii kisi jail main shift karne ke liye ek arzi bhi di hui he
 In this application, he had also told the jail authorities about the threat of life in Taloja jail
 sutron ke mutabik isliye usne usee jail main band bharat nepali ke shooter devendra jagataap ko apane upar hamalaa karne ke liye kaha tha
 In fact, Salem wants to kill two birds with one stone
 pehla to is hamale ke baad use maharashtra se baahar nikaal kar uttar pradesh bhej diya jaae
 If it does not, he can appeal to the Portuguese government to send him back to Portugal
 darasal jab salem ko portugal main giraftaar kar bharat bheja gaya tha, to portugal ke supreme court ne bharat ke saamne ye shart rakhi thi ki wo salem ko maut kii sazaa nahin de saktaa
 If he felt that Abu Salem's life in India's prison was in danger, he could end his extradition treaty with India and demand that Salem be sent back to Portugal
 lihaaza police ko shaq he ki ho saktaa he ki salem ne khud par hamale kii khud hi saazish rachi ho
 Therefore, the matter is also being investigated from this aspect

 India's intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing believes that Lakhvi is going to prove fatal not only to India but to the entire Middle East

 Among the more than one films like 'saat Uchkke', 'inferno', 'anna', 'love Day', Bollywood's Baby Doll Sunny Leone's 'unscrupulous Love' was also released this week
 trailor or gane to niraashajanak the lekin filmpremi or sameekshak hone ke kaaran main 'beyimaan lav' bhi dekhne theatre pahunchaa, aaie aapako aid kii tarah 'before' or 'after' vaali dastaan sunaata hum
 
 
 Before watching the film: Before going to the theater it was in my mind that this film too will have 2-3 special dance numbers (also called item songs by some people)
 kuch intimet seens honge or sani leone thodi or behatar acting karti hui najar aaengi
 The suspense of the interlocutory story will remain intact and after that perhaps there will be better climax and eventually a good film will be seen
 film ke dauraan:jaise hi film kii shuruyaat hoti he jatke se ek special dance number chalane lagata he, jisamen sani leone apni style main parform karti dikhaai detii hai
 Then suddenly some business related scenes, some love-loving scenes, then some typical bed sequences appear, and i keep wondering when the story will start
 isi bich screen par'intermishan'likhaa hua najar aata he
 i pulled out thinking that the story would probably be found in the second half
 khayr interval ke baad ek baar phir se forcephul seens, dialogs, kuch ghise pite intimet seens or aakhirkaar film kaa khatm ho janaa
 After watching the film: When i came out of the theater after watching the film for about two hours, the same question was going on in my mind that for whom are such films made? There was nothing in the film that was new or different
 naa hi koi bahut adbhut intimet seens, naa hi jabardast gane, or naa hi acchhee kahani
 After all, in what hurry has this film been made
 darshak ise kyon dekhne aaenge? sani leone ke naam par kuch log theatre tak ja sakate hai, lekin unhen bhi niraashaa hi milegi
 Even better was Sunny's 'leela' and 'ragini MMS 2' films
 film ke baaki kirdaar jaise rajnish duggal, rajeev verma bhi koi bada prabhaav nahin chhod sake
 Ultimately, the film's debut and outcome was the same and i felt love in the film is not dishonest but dishonest with my ticket money
 to ye to thi meri dastaan, baaki aap khud tay kar sakate hai ki yah film aapako dekhni he yaa nahin kyonki 'marji he aapaki, aakhir paisa he aapkaa
 ' aatanki sanghathan 'islamic state of iran and da levaint' (ISIS) ke mukhiyaabu bakar al-bagdadiki maut kii khabar he
 'radio Iran' has claimed this
 agar yah daawa sahi niklaa to duniya ke sabase khatarnaak aatanki sanghathan ko bada jhatka lag saktaa he
 'all India Radio News' quoted this as 'radio Iran' on Twitter
 Leader of the # isisterrorist group Abu Bakr al-baghdadi has died: Radio Iran— All India Radio News (@airnewsalerts)april 27, 2015ai thi buree tarah ghayal hone kii khabargauratlab he ki pichley hafte british news website 'da gargian' ne bagdadi ke pashchimi iraq main hawaii hamale memburi tarah ghayal hone kii khabar di thi
 Referring to an IS source in Iraq, the 'guardian' wrote that Baghdadi suffered serious injuries in the us-led airstrike on March 8 in al-baz in Nineveh province
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki shuruyaat main bagdadi kii chotein jaanaleva lag rahi thim, lekin baad main usne dhimi gati se ricover karnaa bhi shuru kar diya tha
 It is being told that after Baghdadi was injured, top IS leaders felt that Baghdadi would not survive
 isliye unhone aanan fanan main ek baithak bulaai or nae netaa ke naam par bhi vichaar bhi shuru kar diya
 Significantly, in November and December of last year, there were reports of wounded and killed in Baghdadi's airstrikes, although this could not be confirmed
 iraqi adhikari hisham al-hashimi ne gardian ko bataaya, 'haa, 18 march ko al baj ke najadik umm al-rous gaanv main hue hamale main bagdadi ghayal ho gaya tha
 During that time many other leaders of the organization were also with him
 ' The Spanish train Talgo will be re-tested between Delhi and Mumbai in the first fortnight of September
 dilli or mumbai root par talgo kaa yah paanchavaa or antim trial hoga
 There have been four trials of this train in August, but due to heavy rain the trial could not be completed
 ab mausam vibhaag kii madad legaa rail mantralay1 agast se 12 agast tak dilli or mumbai ke bich talgo kechaar trial hue, lekin in sabhi trylon ke dauraan raste main jhamajham barish rahi or surat ke aage ek baar trek bah jane kii vajah se trial ke dauraan train mumbai tak bhi nahin pahunchi
 In such a situation, the Talgo train will be seen running in the first fortnight of September on a day when it is not raining on this train route
 rail mantralay is maamle main mausam vibhaag kii bhi madad legaa
 Expected to cover delhi-mumbai in less than 11 hours, the Talgo has been seen to run at a maximum speed of 120 to 140 kilometers per hour between Delhi and Mumbai
 talgo train ko 150 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar parmumbai-dillike bich chalaakar nahin dekha gaya he
 Talgo claims that the technology of his coachage is such that his car can run at a speed of 200 kilometers per hour on the existing track itself, but to run at this speed, rail track fencing is necessary
 150 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar ke liye kisi bhi tarah ke siares clearence kii jarurat nahin padegi
 In such a situation, it is expected that the Spanish train will run at a speed of 150 km per hour during the trial between Delhi and Mumbai in September and will complete the distance of these two metros in less than 11 hours
 mumbai or dilli ke bich time trial main safal rahi telgorel mantralay ke ek ucch adhikari ke mutabikatalgo kii train mumbai or dilli ke bichatime trial main safal rahi he
 The specialty of the Talgo Company's coaches is that they can run at high speeds even on sharp curved turns
 dilli or mumbai ke bich relpatariyon par 795 jagah par ghumaav hai, jahaan par train kii raftaar ke liye gati seemaa he
 For example 1
 8 degree ke ghumaav kii rail patariyon par bhartiya railway kii rajdhani express ko 115 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar ke neeche chalaanaa padataa he, lekin talgo kii train 142 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar se daud sakati he
 Similarly, there are many such bridges on this route, on which Rajdhani Express has to run at a speed of 15 km per hour
 lekin talgo ke kochej halke hone kii vajah se in pulon par inke liye koi bhi raftaar seemaa nahin he
 In such a situation, the railway seems quite confident about Talgo
 aluminium ke bane hai talgo train ke dibbespain kii yah train 9 coach vaali he, jisame ek coach janarator, ek dining car ke alaava 5 saamaanya asi chair car or 2 asi ekjicutive class coach he
 Each general coach has seating seats for 36 and executive class coaches for 20 passengers
 talgo dibbon main bhartiya rail ke mukaable aadhe se bhi kam chakke lage hai
 For example, eight wheels are put in a train compartment, but there are two wheels per Talgo
 iske alaava talgo ke dibbe aluminium ke bane hone kii vajah se bhartiya rail dibbon ke 68 ton ke vajan ke mukaable mahaj 16 ton ke hi hote hai, lekin inaki keemat kii baat karen tobhartiya rail dibbonke mukaable inaki keemat teen gune se zyada padegi
