 nai dilli ke madar terresa kricent vaale apane ghar par prasad ne nyaaypalika se sarkaar ke matbhedon kii baat nakaarte hue india today ke associat editor raveesh tiwari se kanoonee sudhaaron ke bare main baat kii
 Edited excerpts: Are law ministers confronting the judiciary? Not at all
 ek vakil or kanoon mantri ke rup main mere or sarkaar ke liye nyaaypalika kii swatantraaa punit evam pavitra he
 We have been among the agitating students of JP movement
 immergency ke dauraan jab adhikaron or swatantraaa kaa hanan aam tha, hamane media, vyakti or nyaayik swatantraaa ke liye ladaai ladi
 Was there any rift between the ministry and the CJI over the appointment of Gopal Subrahmanyam as a judge? The government also has the power to reconsider the collegium system
 sanstha ke nirmaataa ne khud hi sarkaar ko yah haq de rakhaa he
 In the case of Gopal Subrahmanyam, we exercised that right on an objective, concrete and reasonable basis
 is bare main main itnaa hi kah saktaa hum
 Doesn't the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) take away the supremacy of the court in a way? First of all, the bill was passed unanimously in both the houses and there was not a single vote against it
 duusare, yah kavayad 26 saal se chal rahi thi
 There have been about four attempts of constitutional amendments so far
 vidhi ayog, sansadeey samitiyon, mananeey venkatchelaiya kii adhyakshata vaali sarkari samiksha samiti aadi kii anginat reporton main collegium system kii jagah rashtriya nyaayik ayog ko apnaane kii sifarish kii gai thi
 The prominence of the judiciary remains intact
 magar bill us ghatana ke agle hi din pesh kiya gaya jab pradhan nyaayadhish ne collegium system samaapt kiye jane sambandhi yachika ko khaarij kar diya tha?maine pradhan nyaayadhish ke, jinka vyaktigat rup se main bahut sammaan karata hum, vichaaron par kabhi tippanee nahin kii he
 Could the government not hold a public debate and wait till the winter session of Parliament? We have already waited more than 20 years
 aakhir sthaayee samiti har tarah kii raay-mashvira kar hi chuki thi
 Justice J
 in front of many parliamentary committees
 es
 Varma Tak, whose decision brought the collegium system into existence, gave a statement
 venkatchelaiya ayog ne har mumkin raay-mashvira kiya tha
 Is the veto provision not a way to control the judiciary? Absolutely not
 iskaa yah praavdhaan ki ayog ke do sadsy kisi sifarish ko asweekaar kar sakate hai, 1998 ke us faisle kii bhaavana ke anuroop hi he jisamen saaf taur par yah kaha gaya tha ki agar collegium ke do sadasyon ko kisi sifarish par aapatti ho to us par jor na diya jaae
 a commission consisting of six members may have a different opinion, but two opinions become a call for logic and justice, which must be given due attention
 vidhivettaon kaa kahana he ki ayog samvidhan ke mul dhaanche ke khilaaf he
 In contrast, my proposal is a much improved form of previous proposals
 pichley kai prastaavon main to supreme court ke sirf ek nyaayadhish or mukhyamantriyon ko bhi shaamil kiye jane kaa praavdhaan tha
 The Standing Committee had recommended three eminent persons; We are just including two
 yah bahut hi swasth evam santulit sanrachana he
 The basic question is, we respect the independence of the judiciary
 lekin sansad or loktantr bhi mul dhaanche ke hi hisse hai
 If the court repeals the amendment, you will have a direct confrontation with the judiciary
 kya loktantr ke liye yah thik hoga?nyaaypalika ko nyaayik punarawalokan kii shakti praapt he
 We respect him
 sansad kii kanoon banane kii shakti bhi ek sanvaidhanik shakti he
 If anyone challenges, the government will present its case before the court
 javabdehi kaa pahalu jo pehle bill kaa hissaa tha, use bill main kyon nahin shaamil kiya gaya?vah ek alag bill he
 Connecting the two together would complicate matters
 nishchit rup se jald hi is maamle main ek alag vidheyak laayaa jayega

 Mayawati, the Bahujan Samaj Party supremo and former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, reached Risaldar Park on Saturday and gave a final darshan of Buddhist monk Bhante Pragyanand
 beete guuruuvaar ko hi lakhanu ke kejieu aspataal main pragyanand kaa nidhan ho gaya tha
 He was the one who initiated the Buddhist religion to Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar, the creator of the constitution
 nidhan ke baad pragyanand ke parthiv sharir ko risaldaar park buddha vihaar lakhanu main buddha upaskon or buddha anuyaayiyon ke darshanath rakhaa gaya he
 Bhante Pragyanand gave initiation to Babasaheb Ambedkar on October 14, 1956 and was called Ambedkar Guru
 bataa den ki pragyanand ko seene main dard or saans lene main takalif ke baad trama centre main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 From there he was shifted to the Gandhivard of KGMU
 vah gandhi ward keisiu main bhartee the, unke fefde main infections tha or blad sugar kii samasya bhi thi
 90-year-old Pragyanand breathed his last at 11 am on Thursday
 pragyanand kii dekhbhaal karne vaale bhante suman ne bataaya ki wo beete do varsh se bed par the
 Sri Lankan-born Buddhist monk Pragyananda came to India in 1942
 baba sahib ne 1948 or 1951 main lakhanu kaa daura kiya tha
 During this time, he also expressed his desire to adopt Buddhism from Pragyanand
 baad memhindu dharm kii kuritiyon kaa virodhakarte hue 14 oktober 1956 ko baba sahib ne patni sahit buddha dharm apana liya tha
 Seven other Buddhist monks, including Buddhist monks Chandramani and Pragyananda, were initiated at Deekshabhoomi in Nagpur by Dr
 Ambedkar

 Three militants were killed in an encounter on Thursday in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district
 police ke mutabik, muthbhed ke dauraan do jawan bhi ghayal hue hai
 a senior army officer told, "on Thursday afternoon, the presence of militants was reported in Buchu village (tral) of Pulwama district
 iske baad sthaneey police, rashtriya rifles or kendriya rigerv police bal (siarpief) ke javaanon ne us ilaake kii gheraabandi kii
 " unhone kaha, "ghire aatankwaadiyon dwaara suraksha balon par firing ke baad muthbhed hui, jisamen hijbul mujahidin ke teen aatankwaadi maare gaye, jabaki rashtriya rifles ke do jawan ghayal ho gaye
 " adhikari ne kaha, "muthbhed sthal par golibari band ho gai he or chhipe aatankwaadiyon kii talash kii ja rahi hai
 The perpetrators killed are local
 unke paas se teen eke 47 rifl baraamad hui hai
 " janvari kii 7 taarikh jharkhand ke koderma jile kii 12 varshiya madhu kumari ke liye kaal banakar ai
 The innocent girl from bhagwatidih village of Markacho Panchayat went to the farm outside her house in the early hours to defecate
 isi dauraan aawaara kutton ne us par hamalaa kar diya
 Some children tried to drive the dogs away but by then it was too late
 aawaara kutton ne us maasoom ko maar daalaa tha
 This painful incident is not just an accident but it also reveals the claims of the Central Government's ambitious Swachh Bharat Mission and administrative functioning
 jharkhand ke koderma jile ko pichley saal sitambar main hi khule main shouch se mukt(odief)ghoshit kiya ja chukaa he
 Then why did Madhu have to go out of the house for defecation? Obviously, the death of this innocent puts a question mark on the manner of declaring ODF
 kendriya peyajal or swatchta mantralay ke mutabik, odief kii anivaary shart shauchalay kaa istemaal he
 That is, unless all the members of all the households in a village use the toilet, then that village cannot be declared ODF
 sarkaar ke mutabik, odief gaanvon kii sankhya main lagaataar jabardast ijapha ho rahaa he
 According to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (rural) data under the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, about 6 crore 13 lakh household toilets have been built in the villages under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan starting from 2 October 2014 till 5 February 2018
 gaanvon ko odief ghoshit karne main bhi jabardast teji he
 While 47,105 villages were declared ODF in 2015-16, 3,16,670 villages have been declared ODF so far in 2017-18
 yani pichley do saal main hi odief gaanvon kii sankhya main 2,69,565 yani 572 fisadi (kareeb 6
 7 times) increased (see graphics)
 in aankadon par bharosa karen to 2015 ke baad se teen saal main rojaanaa kareeb 51,000 shauchalay ban rahe hai or pichley 2016 se prati din kareeb 370 gaanv odief ghoshit kiye ja rahe hai
 The ground reality: You will keep searching for Dobal Gram Panchayat, about 30 km from Pauri town in Pauri Garhwal district of Uttarakhand
 isi panchayat main he kaserpur gaanv
 This village has a population of about two hundred and fifty, near the lush green mountains and river valley
 gaanv main sabake paas mobile phone or aadhaar card he lekin log ab bhi khule main shouch jane ko majaboor hai
 Ironically, on June 22 last year, the government has declared all rural areas of Uttarakhand as ODF
 sarkaar kaa daawa he ki gramin uttarakhand main 100 fisadi gharon main shauchalay nirmaan kar diya gaya he
 When India Today's team reached Keshavpur, share cropper Devilal along with his daughter were breaking mustard greens in the field
 odief kii baat par ve kehete hai, ''hallaa to bahut he lekin hamase to koi shauchalay ke bare main poochne tak nahin aayaa
 "his daughter Kamla also replies," i was born here, married here, have children too, but have not yet seen any toilet facility in the village
 mahilaon ko shouch ke liye andhere kaa intjaar karnaa padataa he
 Either get out towards the forest before dawn or wait for it to be night
 ’’ phir, khataron kaa andeshaa hameshaa bana rahata he
 Talking about the next day's daily wage on a mobile phone, Komal Singh of the village says, "there is no electricity and toilet facilities in the village, whereas the risk of guldar (leopard) in this area is very high
 ’’ jaahir he, is gaanv kaa haal uttarakhand ke odief ke daawey ko munh chidhaa rahaa he
 Officials' statement about Madhu's death in the Panchayat declared ODF in Jharkhand was that Madhu's family name was not in the baseline survey of the ODF and hence the toilet could not be built in it (the central government learned the status of toilets in the country in 2011-12 a survey was conducted for which was released in 2012-13
 ise besaline survey kaha jaataa he)
 In Uttarakhand, the baseline survey under which toilets have been built, does not include the names of many people
 pradesh ke vitt or swajal mantri prakaash pant is baat ko sweekaar karte hai, ''pradesh ke gramin ilaakon ko 2011-12 ke besaline line survey ke aadhaar par odief ghoshit kiya gaya he
 Accordingly, the target was to build 5,90,000 toilets in the state, which has been completed
 ’’ aise main sawaal uthta he ki gaanvon ko vaaki khule main shouch se mukt karnaa he yaa mahaj kaagajon kii khanaapurti kerani he?kamobesh yahi haal duusare rajyon kaa bhi he
 On February 10, Munni Bai, a 40-year-old who went to the open defecation in Sonagara, village panchayat of Surpur district of Chhattisgarh, was crushed to death by elephants
 lekin sarkari kaagajon main to na sirf yah panchayat balki chhattisgarh ke puure gramin ilaake ko odief ghoshit kiya ja chukaa he
 About 92 percent of the ODF declared in Rajasthan is also similar
 pradesh ke sarahadi jile jaisalmer ko 2017 ke aktubar main odief ghoshit or satyapit bhi kiya ja chukaa he
 But when India Today visited some villages in the district, toilets have been shown in paper at many places, but toilets were found on the spot
 aisa hi ek gaanv do sau aabaadi vaale hamiron kii basti he
 Moyab Khan of the village says, "the sarpanch can tell why the toilets are not built
" hamen shauchalay banane ke liye paise nahin mili
 Nor do we have enough money to make it ourselves
 paisa milegaa to ham banavaa bhi lenge
 "similarly, toilets have been built in only about 50 houses in the village beyond 400 houses
 graminon kii shikaayat he, jin logon ne shauchalay bana liye hai, unhen uskaa bhugtan nahin mila he
 The rest of the villagers did not show any interest in building toilets
 jaisalmer ke colector ke
 C
 meena kaa kahana he, ''jaisalmer main 2012 ke survey ke mutabik, 1,04,812 parivaar hai
 38,208 toilets have already been built and the remaining 66,594 have been constructed in the last six years
 ab tak bane shauchalay par 29 karod, 17 lakh ru
 Have been spent
 8 karod, 87 lakh ru
 Payment is due, which will be attempted to be paid soon
 ’’ colector meena kii maane to puure jile main mahaj 10 parivaar bache hai jinke paas shauchalay nahin he
 While the ground reality is something else
 kya hai odiasekendriya peyajal auki swatchta mantralay ke mutabik khule main shouch se mukt (odief) kaa paimaana aavashyak rup se shauchalay kaa istemaal he
 That is, the Gram Panchayat, the district or the state (all rural), all the people of all families use toilets, the same is ODF
 satyapaodief ko chaar stareey satyaapan se guzarana padataa he
 First the block level, then the district, then the state level officials and finally the officials of the Union Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation do the verification
 shauchalay nirmaanh1-besaline survey main jiskaa naam ho vah vyakti swatchta adhikari ke paas naam darj karaata he
 2-the officer gives the acknowledgment of the commencement of construction
 3-45-50 din main nirmaan puraa karnaa hota he
 4-built toilet, it is necessary to have water tank, arrangement of lights, door
 5-kaam puraa hone kii soochna ke baad adhikari raseed lekar 12,000 kii protsaahan raashi jari karata he
 And who became, for what purpose? Another problem appears in Dabdi village of Jaisalmer district
 yahaan meghavaalon kii basti main kareeb 175 parivaar hai, jinamein kareeb aadhe pariwaron ke paas shauchalay hai
 But due to lack of water, people do not use them either
 gaanv ke lakshmana ram bataate hai, ‘‘mere ghar main shauchalay bana hua he par pani kii kami ke kaaran ham kabhi-kabhaar hi iskaa istemaal karte hai
 "they say that earlier the water pipeline used to pass through their homes, but this line is closed and they have to bring water from far away
 isi tarah jile main khuiyala, baandha, kuchdi, tanot, gamnevaala, ranau, kuriaberry, paanche kaa taala, avaay jaise kai gaanv hai, jahaan bahut hi kam sankhya main shauchalay bane hai
 At the same time, people do not use them because of the scarcity of water
 haalanki jile ke colector meena aankadon par puri tarah kaayam hai, ‘‘jila puri tarah odief he
 This target has been achieved based on the 2011 baseline survey
 adhiktar log shauchalay kaa istemaal karte hai or jo nahin kar rahe hai, unke bich lagaataar jaagrukta abhiyaan chalaaya ja rahaa he
 "scams have eaten toilets, but district council chief Anjana Meghwal does not agree with the collector
 unke mutabik, ‘‘gramin anchalon main ek fisadi log bhi bane hue shauchalay kaa istemaal nahin karte
 Most of the population still goes to defecation in the open
 ek to jaagrukta kii kami he, pani kii samasya ise or badhaati he
 There is no specific plan for ODF in desert areas
 ’’isi tarah aatmavishvaas se bhare barmer ke colector shivaprasad nakaate bhi daawa karte hai ki is jile main bhi 31 march, 2018 tak 88,000 baaki bache sabhi shauchalay bana liye jaaenge
 But here too, problems like Jaisalmer stand
 thar registan main aabaad jaisalmer jile se kareeb 2,000 kimi dur bengal kii khadi se lage odisha ke puri jile ke khandahota gram panchayat ko jald hi odief ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he kyonki yahaan shauchalay banane kaa lakshya hasil kiya ja chukaa he
 But people are using these toilets not for defecation but for keeping cattle
 graminon kaa kahana he ki in shauchalayon kaa nirmaan itane bekaar tareeke se kiya gaya he ki ye istemaal nahin kiye ja sakate
 However, Sarpanch Dhavaleshwar Nayak, who appointed contractors to construct toilets, believes, "the demand for water here is met by tankers
" pine ke liye pani nahin he to log shauchalay ke liye pani kahaan se laaen
 According to the National Sample Survey, 2015, about 60 percent of the toilets in rural areas of the country do not have water
 jaahir he, aise main log unka istemaal anya kaamon ke liye kar rahe hai
 Layers of disturbances in the construction of toilets also open in Uttar Pradesh
 pradesh ke lalitpur jile main odief ghoshit ho chuke bamhori sar gaanv ke prasann rajput ke yahaan 2017 ke sitambar main shauchalay banaaya gaya he
 But Prasanna's mother Rajkunwar says, "the village secretary has left the toilet pits incomplete
 jo pipe lagaai gai, vah bhi chatak kar kharaab ho gai he
 Even on many occasions, the toilet work was not completed
 aise main hamaara parivaar baahar hi shouch jane ko majaboor he
 "toilets were built here in the same village of Ramlal in 2016-17, but the daughter-in-law of the house says prayer," Two days after the construction, the toilet seat was sunk into the ground
 seat tut jane ke kaaran shouch ke liye baahar jane ko majaboor hai
 The story of Kahar Singh of the village is also similar
 kagaji he pairahan: aankadon kii baazeegariuttarakhand sarkaar rajya ke odief ghoshit hone ke liye kuch zyada hi jaldi main he
 As soon as the declaration of ODF of rural Uttarakhand was declared, Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said, "uttarakhand has become ODF due to collective and community effort
 is vishesh uplabdhi ke peeche pradhanmantri kii apil kaa asar he
 For this i would like to praise all the village heads of the state
 ’’ lekin ab vahi gram pradhan is yojana ke tahat sirf aadhi rakam milane se halkaan hai
 Village head of Dharkot, Bhupendra Singh says, "at present, half the amount has been received in the scheme
 kaam abhi puraa nahin hua he
 We have not sent the ODF report
 report bhejte hi hamen puri rakam dene kaa vaada adhikariyon ne kiya he
 "if the princes did not send the ODF report, then on what basis were the panchayats declared as ODF? The village head of Kanda Panchayat in Pauri Garhwal district, Surendra Mohan, says," The announcement was made over but at the village level No one has come and seen
 ’’ uttarakhand main jo gaanv chhot gaye hai, uske liye besaline survey ko vajah mana jaataa he
 Swajal Project Officer S
 in Pauri
 es
 Sharma says, "the baseline survey of toilets built under the mission is 2011-12
 jo is survey main shaamil nahin ho paae hai, unke yahaan manaregaa ke tahat shauchalay banaae jaaenge
 1,100 for the first toilet of the Cleanliness Mission for just Rs
 (1999 main sampurna swatchta abhiyaan ke tahat) or 51,00 ru
 (under 2005 Nirmal Gram Yojana) were available in grants, but it was difficult to build toilets in such amount
 un labhaarthiyon ke naam bhi record main aa gaye
 By next March 2018, we will also cover all of them under ODF Plus
 ’’ jaahir he, pradesh ko kaagajon par hi puri tarah odief ghoshit kiya ja rahaa he
 At the national level too, there are many flaws in the statistics of toilets and ODF
 odief kaa elaan hone ke 90 din ke bheetar satyaapan kaa praavdhaan he lekin uttarakhand main kareeb dhai hajaar gaanvon kaa satyaapan chah maheene ke baad hua
 About one lakh ODF declared villages in 2017-18 are not verified
 duusari taraf, is mishan ke pehle jo shauchalay bane par kharaab rahe, unhen bhi shauchalay ke record main darj kar liya gaya, jabaki ve istemaal main hai hi nahin
 According to the 2014 report of the United Nations, 79 lakh toilets are defunct in the country
 sulabh shauchalay ke sansthaapak bindeshwari pathak bhi is baat ko sweekaar karte hai
 'all work is going on in figures, but the ground reality is something else' Swachh Bharat Abhiyan seems to be missing? The Prime Minister's initiative has brought the inspiration of cleanliness from door to door
 lekin sari jimmedaari pradhanmantri kii nahin he
 It is also the work of machinery
 hamane pradhanmantri se kaha he ki toilet ke liye 12,000 ru
 Not enough
 banegaa to uski gunvattta kuch khaas nahin rahegi
 What does an average toilet cost? a normal toilet costs 20-25,000
 main banataa he, par hamane 15-20 aise dizin banaae hai jinaki laagat 12,000 se 5,000 ru
 Is also up to par iskaa kaam kisi agency ko de diya jaae to vah apni cat to legi hi
 Then quality will matter
 desh ke 11 rajya odief ghoshit ho gaye lekin
 
 
 i will not answer you (laughs) but toilets are not built in many places but villages are declared ODF
 besaline survey main saikadon log chhot gaye?aap thik kah rahe hai
 But i cannot give any answer on the baseline survey
 vaise, shauchalay kaa bananaa or aankadon kii reporting kaa khel 1986 se chal rahaa he
 The only way to change it is to trend the boy from the village and hand it over
 aavanton bhi badhanaa hoga
 12,000 Rs
 ke saath atirikt rakam lone ke rup main deni hogi
 This will make good toilets
 hamane jin 25 sau gaanvon ko odief banaaya he, vahaan shikaayat nahin milegi
 In states like Odisha, people are living in toilets? The government should decide that even if there are no toilets in every house, as many as they become useable
 yani aapako lagata he ki sarkari model main khami he?bilkul khami he
 And scams are also coming out? i have also been working in 26 states since 1974
 1,600 shaharon main ghotaalaa kahin to nahin hua
 But when all the recipients have met, what can we say? sarkaar main jo log hai or netaa hai unka to kuch bigadataa hi nahin
 In many places, there is also a problem of water in the toilets? In our design, one lotus of water is enough for flush
 lekin hamase kisi ne poocha nahin in takneekon ke bare main
 There is also a problem of treatment? There are 4,041 government notified towns and sewers are in only 732 cities
 dilli main hi treetment mahaj 69 fisad he
 Even in Delhi, 31 percent of the stool is going to Yamuna without treatment
 mishan ke aankadon kaa pechbesline sarvesvachh bharat mishan ke tahat shauchalayon ke nirmaan main 2012-13 ke besaline survey ko aadhaar banaaya gaya he
 That is, there are no plans for the population after that
 sanyukt raashtra kii 2014 kii report main hi desh main 79 lakh shauchalay bina istemaal ke pade hanshauchalay istemaal hi nahinjaisalmer se lekar bundelkhand ke kuch gaanv odief ghoshit, lekin vahaan yaa to shauchalay kharaab bane yaa phir pani kii kami kii vajah se unka istemaal hi nahin, or aankadon main shauchalay bane hue hanghotalaa hi ghotalaakai jagahon par kaagaj ke aankadon main shauchalay bana dikhaakar paise hadap liye gaye (dekhen ghotaale kaa box), jabaki asal main ve bane hi nahinkaagaj par odiafuttarakhand main kai pradhanon kaa aarope ki shauchalay puure banaae bina hi odief ghoshit kar diya gayaaye bhi raah kii adchanenodief satyaapan main deriodief ghoshit jagahon ko teen maah ke bheetar satyapit karnaa hota he, lekin kai jagah iske baad bhi satyaapan nahin
 Nearly one lakh ODF declared villages are not verified (as of February 13, 2018) in 2017-18
 Pending applications are waiting for more than one million applications across the country, of which 97% applications are stuck for more than six months due to delay in payment
 Complaints of delay in payment of water, according to a 2015-16 survey by the National Sample Survey Office, about 60% of rural toilets lack water, and 40% have drainage Mr

 pehlerel mantri pawan kumaar bansalki rail patari se utari, phir ghante bhar baad hikanoon mantri ashvini kumarako gaiyr-kanoonee kaam mahangaa pad gaya
 Late night, Ashwini Kumar submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 ashvini kumaar ke istife kii kahanikanoon mantri se istipha dilwane ke liye congress ko kaaphi mashkkat kerani padi
 According to reports, the Congress did not have to work very hard for the resignation of the Railway Minister, but Ashwani Kumar did not easily prepare for the resignation
 ve aakhri vakt tak apni safai dete rahe
 According to sources, before meeting the Prime Minister, Ashwini Kumar met Ahmed Patel and tried his best to give his clarification
 ashvini ne poocha ki aakhir meraa kasoor kya he? ashvini kumaar ne kaha ki sonia ji istipha nahin chaahati or is maamle par unase baat kii ja sakati he
 On this, Ahmed Patel said that no decision has been taken and there is a lot of pressure in the party too
 ashvini kamaar ne phir kaha ki party main bhi baat kii ja sakati he
 On this, Ahmed Patel said that the decision has been taken
 sutara bataate hai ki ye puraa drama kareeb 50 minute tak chalata rahaa, tab jaakar ashvini kumaar istife ke liye taiyaar hue
 According to the stories of Pawan Bansal's resignation, Pawan Bansal also tried to explain
 yahi nahin unhone istife kii peshkash bhi kii thi
 On May 4, he wrote a one-page letter to the Prime Minister, clarifying the arrest of his nephew
 bansal ne kaha tha ki wo istipha dena chaahate hai, lekin pradhanmantri ne unhen intjaar karne ko kaha
 But on May 10, Sonia Gandhi met the Prime Minister and it is believed that a decision was taken on Pawan Bansal's resignation in this meeting
 iske baad pawan bansal rail mantralay gaye or apana istipha bheja
 Why did Ashwani Kumar have to resign? The law minister found it expensive to change the status report of the CBI in the coal scam worth millions of crores
 isi saal 8 march ko koyala ghotaale ke maamle main sibiai kii ore se ek halafanama supreme court main pesh kiya janaa tha
 If that affidavit does not become the throat of the government, so before that four such high profile meetings were held, out of which two were present law ministers themselves
 isi saal farvari main ek din kanoon mantri ashvini kumaar, atorni general ji i vaahnavati, sibai diarector ranjit sinha or tatkaaleen edishnal solicytor general harin rawal kii ek gupt baithak kanoon mantri ke daptar main hui
 It was decided at that meeting that the CBI report be kept in a sealed envelope instead of sending it as an affidavit to keep the case a secret
 supreme court ne 24 janvari ko kol block aavanton ghotaale main sibiai jaanch par states report maangi thi
 But, the law minister did not stop at playing with the law
 6 march ko kanoon mantri ke daftar main ek baar phir ashvini kumaar, atorni general ji i vaahnavati, sibiai diarector ranjit sinha, tatkaaleen edishnal solicytor general harin rawal, sibiai ke joint secetry o pi galhotra or sibiai ke diaiji ravikant kii baithak hui
 Ashwini Kumar suggested some changes in the status report there
 mantriji kaa hukum maanate hue states report se screening cameti ke kuch chart hataa die gaye
 The Supreme Court reprimanded the government for this
 congress or sarkaar pehle to ashvini kumaar kaa bachaav karte rahe, lekin pani sir ke upar ja pahunchaa, to mantriji kii kursi kii qurbaani leni padi
 Pawan Kumar Bansal and Ashwini Kumar are considered very close to PM Manmohan Singh, but coincidentally, the two ministers close to the Prime Minister had to go together
 kyon patari se utari rail mantri kii kursi?aakhir, 3 may ko shuru hue hiprophile siyaasi drame kaa ant 10 may ko ho hi gaya
 First Pawan Bansal's nephew Vijay Singla was caught red-handed taking bribe, and then later Pawan Bansal was also surrounded by his flames

 On the night of 3 May, after the cbi's big revelations and action, a tornado erupted
 ek saptaah kii uthapathak ke baad pawan bansal ko istipha dene ke liye aakhirkaar congress haikaman ko kahana hi padaa
 The string of allegations started with Pawan Bansal's nephew Vijay Singla, one end of whom was later joined by Mama Pawan Bansal
 3 may ko hi sibiai ne chandigarh or mumbai main chaar logon ko giraftaar kiya
 The case is related to crores of bribery in the Railway Ministry and Pawan Bansal's nephew Vijay Singla was arrested by the CBI taking a bribe of 90 lakhs
 sibiai ke mutabik vijay singla or railway board member mahesh kumaar ke bich 10 karod rupye kii deal hui thi, jiske mutabik vijay singla ne mahesh kumaar ko railway board member electrical banavaane kaa vaada kiya tha
 Under this deal, on May 3, the CBI seized Rs 90 lakh given as the first installment of the bribe
 pawan bansal or mahesh kumaar ke bich bhi kai baar mulaakaat ke saboot saamne aa chuke hai
 Pawan Bansal and Mahesh Kumar met in Delhi on 7 April, while on 17 April, information about the meeting between Pawan Bansal and Mahesh Kumar has been revealed in Mumbai

 aaj release hui he, dheron vivaadon se nikalakar rupahale parde tak pahunchi film 'ems : da massenger' iskaa nirmaan kiya he deraa sachcha sauda ke hakeekat antertenment ne or mukhya bhoomika nibhaane sahit film ke kai vibhaagon ko sambhala he khud baba gurmeet ram rahim singh ne
 Even with the direction of the film, apart from Jeetu Arora, Gurmeet Ram Rahim himself has been associated
 film ko lekar sabase bada sawaal uthaa tha ki kya baba ram rahim film main khud kaa prachaar kar rahe hai, to jawaab he ki film, gurmeet ram rahim ko thik usee tarah dikhaati he, jaise unke anuyaayi unhen dekhte hai
 Yes, but those people who are not his disciples will definitely find this film promoting Baba Ram Rahim and Dera Sacha Sauda
 film main jin saamaajik buraaiyon ko dikhaaya gaya he, ve vaaki maujuuda halaat main kadavi sachai hai
 Filmmakers and film goers may find the film technically and funny given the rest of the departments, but the message given in the film is serious and solid
 film kaaphi had tak sant ram rahim kii jindagi bayaan karti he
 Baba in the film makes people away from addiction like drugs and alcohol and makes him a follower, due to which the drug and alcohol mafia becomes Baba's enemies
 tab baba ram rahim apni chamatkaari shaktiyon se khud ko or apane shishyon ko mafia se bachaate hai
 The film also stars Flora Saini and Jai Shree alongside Baba Ram Rahim
 film dekhne se pehle mujhe film se koi ummid nahin thi or na hi baba se achche abhinay kii, lekin aashcharya is baat kaa he ki film ke ection or drama ne mujhe film se jode rakhaa
 If you can digest the action of Sunny Deol, Ajay Devgan, Rajinikanth and Salman Khan then why not the action of Sant Ram Rahim
 ajay jahaan do bikes, do kaaron or do ghodon par khadey hokar ection kar sakate hai, to baba ram rahim do chalati bason par kyon nahin
 There is no doubt that Baba is raw in acting, but his conviction, ie his conviction on his character, is worth watching
 film ke kuch gane pehle hi charchaa bator chuke hai or agar bhavyata kii baat karun to shaayad hi bollywood kii kisi film yaa gane main asal main itani bheed nazar ai ho, jitani baba kii film main mujhe dikhi
 An attempt has been made to hide the weaknesses of Ram Rahim's acting and dance from the quick changing scene, ie the editing of the songs is good
 khaamiyon kii baat karen to special effects kii quality kaaphi kharaab he
 All actors, except actor Gaurav Gera, are making noise in the film in terms of acting
 deraa sachcha sauda kii ore se jin samaajik kaamon ko karne kaa daawa kiya jaataa rahaa he, un sabaki jhalak film main dikhi
 For example, blood donation, getting girls out of prostitution, campaigns against alcohol, drugs, even global warming
 kis shrenee main film ko rakhaa jaae, yah sochna mere liye mushkil kaam tha, lekin phir laga, jin logon kaa vishwaas baba ram rahim or unke deraa sachcha sauda par he, ve iskaa anand uthaaenge
 Those who are not followers of Baba will watch the film laughingly
 unhen yah film anjaane main kamedi kii tarah hansaa sakati he
 Yes, but the social issues that Baba talks about in his film are not joking issues, and the society needs to think seriously about them
 meri ore se film kii reating he - 2

 bhagwaan na to marate hai
 Nor do they fade away leaving their devotees crying
 shri satya sai baba swaghoshit taur par bhagwaan the, bilkul un logon kii tarah jo unke darshan ke liye unke 'prasanti nilaum' ke baahar panktibaddh hokar khadey rahete the
 But the difference between them and those overwhelmed by their aura was that they knew that they were God, while the rest of them did not know
 andhra pradesh main babaake shahar puttaparthi main, jahaan isai dharmaguru pope ke vatican kii tarah shraddhaluon kii bheed umadti he, easter ke ravivaar ko jab unhone 85 saal kii umr main apni aakhri saans lee, to unke bhakton ne ise unki mrityu nahin mana
 It was not a full stop but a semicolon in the cosmic cycle of avatars
 yah sirf deh kaa tyaag tha
 However, he could not follow the time which he himself had set for his departure from this world
 baba ke mahatvapurn ang nirdhaarit samay se 11 saal pehle hi jawaab de gaye
 On the day Jesus was resurrected, the world's most popular and wealthiest preacher left the stage on which he had been sitting for nearly seven decades
 ve apni durlabh chumbakeey shakti se garibon, amiron, raajnneetikon, arbapatiyon or filmi sitaron ko apane charnon main jhukaate aa rahe the
 The supreme master and lord sharing peace and love, and his best friend no longer for millions of devotees
 lekin unka aabhamandal barkaraar he
 And also his vast empire built on the strength of his charisma
 manushya ko aadhyatmik shanti uplabdh karaane ke bazaar main har duusare guru kii tarah satya sai baba kii kinvadanti kaa pehla vaakya swayan baba ne hi likhaa tha
 It began 85 years ago in the month of November in the village of Puttaparthi, where Satyanarayana Raju was born with certain spiritual powers
 ve vayask hone se pehle hi guru ban gaye the or 14 saal kii umr main unhen ehsaas hua ki ve koi saadhaaran manushya nahin balki shiridy ke sai baba (1835-1918) ke avatar hai
 This was the beginning of that person's life, whose fame was going to spread far beyond Puttaparthi
 unke ghaney ghunghraale bal vaise hi sabase alag dikhte the jaise ki naarangi rang ke unke vastra
 Baba associated his spiritual powers with social work
 dukhaharta, upadeshak or chamatkaaron se paroapkaar karne vaale baba ne kisi dharm vishesh kaa anusaran nahin kiya balki apane upadeshon main maanavtaa ke paanch stambhon par jor diya-satya, naitik aacharan, shanti, prem or ahimsa
 In the end, it is these miracles that maintain people's faith towards Gods and ascetics
 sai baba ne hawa se raakh or swiss ghadiyaan paidaa karne ke chamatkaar dikhaane se kahin zyada saamaajik kaam kiye
 His contribution in the field of health, education and drinking water is an ever-present miracle, which is making the lives of thousands of people happy
 phir bhi baba ke aalochak pragatisheel log un par tarahatarah ke aarope lagaate hai or unke chamatkaaron ko haathon kii safai bataate hai
 However, the controversy could not diminish his charisma
 ravivaar ke dinjab ve aasthaa ke 8 arab dollar vaale samrajya se vidaa hue tab tak satya sai baba ne vah sab hasil kar liya tha jo duusare baabaaon ke liye mushkil he- unhone aadhyatmikta or saamaajikta ke bich main saraahneey santulan banaaya tha

 rashtriya doping rodhi agency (nadaa) ne pahalwaan narsingh yadav ko somvaar ko doping aaropon se bari kar diya
 This paved the way for him to go to Rio Olympics
 nadaa ne kaha ki yah pahalwaan sajeesh kaa shikaar hua
 The drama lasted a week after Narasimha's positive anabolic steroid methanadinone was found positive on June 25, after Nada Director General Naveen Aggarwal read out his statement acquitting him, doubting his fate
 jaan boojhkar nahin liya tha steroingarwal ne is faisle ko padhate hue kaha, ‘hamane beete samay ke (do june tak) ke namoonay ko dhyaan main rakhaa, jisamen uskaa koi bhinamoona positivanhin paaya gaya tha
 It was inconceivable what would be the benefit of taking this banned substance once
 isliye panel kaa maananaa tha ki ek baar liya gaya padaarth ‘jaan boojhkar’ nahin liya gaya tha
 Rule 10 of Nada
 4 kaa mila phaaydaunhone saath hi kaha, ‘panel ne mana ki yah athlete nadaa kii doping rodhi samhita kii 10
 4 is entitled to the benefit of Sec
 yah dhyaan main rakhte hue ki vah sajeesh kaa shikaar hua, panel nenada ke doping rodhiniyamon ke aaropon se use bari kar diya
 Agarwal said that the sample taken on July 5 contained much less restricted substance than the sample taken on June 25
 sajeesh kaa shikaar hua tha narsinghunhone kaha, ‘25 june ko liye gaye namoonay kii report main pratibandhit padaarth kii jitani maatra pai gai thi, vah paanch july ko liye gaye namoonay main kaaphi kam ho gai
 Agarwal said, "the important thing is that when the second sample of the athlete was taken on July 5, he did not know the report of the first sample
 agar yah khilaadi niyamit rup se ise le rahaa hota to paanch july kii report main is pratibandhit padaarth kii maatra utani hi hoti
 Narsingh said - Confident of getting justice, Narasimha, who is breathing breathlessness, said that he is desperate to go to the Olympics and win medals for the country
 unhone kaha, ‘main bahut khush hum or olympic main padak jeetne kii ummid lagaae hum
 Truth won
 yah sunishchit karegaa ki kisi anya khilaadi ke saath aisa kuch nahin ho
 This is a big win
 ’ narsingh ne kaha, ‘main jaanata tha ki main sahi hum or mujhe nyaay milane kaa puraa bharosa tha
 Indian Olympic Wrestling Federation (WFI) President Brij Bhushan Singh said that the process of inducting Narasimha into the Olympic team has started
 is doping prakaran ke saamne aane ke baad bharat kaa 74 kigra varg main kota sthaan bachaane ke liye rio jane vaali team main unki jagah praveen rana ko bhejne kii ghoshnaa kii gai thi
 Narasim Singh will go again in place of Praveen Rana said, "to save the country's quota, we had sent the name of Praveen Rana and told the World Organization that if Narasimha gets the green signal then it will be sent only
 hamane united vishwa kushti ko bataa diya tha ki narsingh cadoping se bari hone ke baadawah praveen rana kii jagah legaa
 He said, 'we are confident that Narasimha will go
 faisle se spasht he ki narsingh sajeesh kaa shikaar hua tha
 Nada Singh Yadav will go to Rio if Nada has agreed to this

 a recent meeting of security agencies has revealed that some suspicious activities are being carried out in Narowal district of Pakistan
 yahaan par kuch sandigdh stri-purush dekhe gaye hai
 The agencies suspect that the ISI is or is in the process of opening a new terrorist training center in Narowal
 aapako bataa den ki kartarpur sahib pakistani punjab ke narowal jile main hi sthit he
 The agencies suspect that the infuriated people in Pakistan can now make Narowal their new base so that Indian Punjab can be infiltrated
 narowal main bhartiya agenciyon kii kadi nazarbhartiya suraksha agenciyon ko shaq he ki ISI or khalistaani samarthak gurudware ke darshan ke liye jane vaale shraddhaluon ko bargalane kii koshish kar sakate hai
 Security agencies in India have been keeping a close watch on Narowal, especially since former Pakistan Army Chief General Aslam Baig had said in an interview that Pakistan would send jihadis to India through the Kartarpur corridor

 isse pehle kai baar dekha gaya he ki pakistan jane vaale kai kathith shraddhalu waapas laut kar nahin aae
 Apart from the return of the pilgrims, another major challenge before the security agencies will be to stop the infiltration of suspected Pakistanis through the corridor
 sutron ke mutabik shraddhaluon ke vesh main koi sandigdh pakistani nakli dastavej dikhaakar bharat main daakhil naa ho paae iske liye shraddhaluon ke aane-jane par kai baar dastavejon kii jaanch hogi

 is antim daur kii ladaai main jeet-haar kaa matlab, kya he siyaasi dalon ke ati aakraamak vyavhaar or kya he is antim daur main har dal kii ek ek seat par chunavi ranneeti? aaie jaanate hai chunavi jang ke antim morche kii kahani
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has to fight the last battle in Kashi
 prachaar khatm hone ke baad narendra modi ab kedarnath main aasthaa main leen hai
 At the same time, before the last round of voting, when the opposition is busy in multiplication of coalition from Delhi to Lucknow
 aise main pradhanmantri modi do kilometre paidal chalakar kedarnath dham pahunch gaye
 He bowed with reverence and meditated in the cave
 2019 kii maha pariksha kaa antim paper baaki he
 Or say the final paper's marking remains
 achche marks paane ke liye party ke netaaon ne khub pasinaa bahaya
 During the election campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has 146 rallies, Rahul Gandhi 122, Yogi Adityanath 135 and Amit Shah 172 rallies
 vahiin 484 siton par vot daale ja chuke hai
 Now 59 seats are at stake in the final battle
 bijepi kaa daawa ye he ki bahumat ke baad atirikt siton ke bonus ke liye ye siten unke liye jaruri hai
 The opposition claims that it is necessary to win these seats as the last bet of the change of power
 bengal main bijepi kaa jor or mamata kaa palatwarbat talkhi or tu-tadaak tak bhi rahati to ganimat thi, ye kehake tasalli di ja sakati thi ki siyasat kaa str neeche gaya he
 But the kind of violence, arson and abuse of the last six phases of voting in West Bengal has raised the question why? Why in Bengal? Dum Dum, Barasat, Basirhat, Jayanagar, Mathurapur, Diamond Harbor, Jadavpur, Kolkata South, Kolkata North are to be voted in West Bengal
 in sabhi siton par philhal mamata kii party trinmul congress kaa kabza he, lekin bijepi ke bengal main mishan 23 plus ke lihaaj se ye sabhi siten behad ahm hai
 Apart from the bjp's top leadership in these areas, the strongman Mukul Roy, who joined the tmc's BJP, has consistently campaigned on the basis of caste and religious equations
 bijepi ne sabase adhik urja pashchim bengal main kharch kii
 UP, Bihar and West Bengal were the three states where voting was provided in the seven phases
 pashchim bengal kii ahmiyat siton ke lihaaj se aise samaj aati he ki agar upi jaise vishaal rajya main pradhanmantri maudi ne 27 reliyaan kin to pashchim bengal main 17 reliyaan kin
 BJP President Amit Shah held 15 rallies and public meetings

 Mamta Banerjee is the leader who led the most powerful leadership of the anti-modi front
 chunaavon ke baad vipakshi dalon ke sambhavit gathbandhan main unka kad pehali pankti main samajha jaataa he
 But his political stature will depend a lot on how much he will be able to stop the expansion of BJP in Bengal
 mamata samarthak unhen piem ke taur par dekhnaa chaahate hai
 There are many who have named Mayawati as PM, even then the Congress has not given up its claim
 antim ladaai se pehle sarkaar gathan kii taiyaariyaan shuru ho chuki hai
 Mamta Banerjee is the leader who led the most powerful leadership of the anti-modi front
 chunaav baad vipakshi dalon ke sambhavit gathbandhan main unka kad pehali pankti main samajha jaataa he, lekin bengal main bijepi ke vistaar ko wo kitna roak paane main safal ho sakengi is par bhi unka siyaasi kad kaaphi kuch nirbhar karegaa
 Attempts to form a government The efforts to form a government have intensified even before the last phase of these massive elections
 yani agar puri siten naa ain, to koun koun samarthan de saktaa he
 If a mixed mandate came, how can the claim to form a government be presented as soon as possible
 ye sari taiyaariyaan shuru ho gai hai
 Sonia Gandhi herself has taken the initiative to unite the anti-bjp parties, and called a meeting of the opposition parties on the day of the results i
e
 23 May
 iske liye congress kii taraf se vipakshi netaaon ko aupchaarik nyauta bhej diya gaya he
 Not only are the constituents of the UPA on this list, but invitations have also been sent to the leaders of political parties advocating for the Third Front
 abhi tak ensipi ke sharad pavaar or diemke se em ke stallin ne nyauta sweekaar kiya he
 In fact, the Congress fears that a situation like Goa and Manipur may not arise in the event of close results
 jab congress sarkaar banane se chook gai thi, lekin bijepi kareebi ladaai maan hi nahin rahi
 He has expressed confidence of crossing the figure of three hundred in each of his claims
 tisare morche ke kayaskoshish keval congress kii nahin hai, gaiyr bijepi sarkaar banane ke liye tidipi adhyaksh chandrababu naidu dilli daure par aae
 Naidu met left leaders
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal se mili
 Rahul met Gandhi on Saturday
 sharad pavaar se mili
 And then went to Lucknow and also met Akhilesh
 haalanki dilachasp hoga ki sarkaar banane kii koshishon main juty partiyaan piem ummidavaari ko lekar kya qurbaani dene ko taiyaar hongi
 Ghulam Nabi Azad says that it is clear that the Congress is the oldest political party in the country
 agar hamen 5 saal tak sarkaar chalaani he to sabase badi raajnneetik party ko hi iskaa mauka milanaa chahie
 The NDA is also beating hands, the BJP has also started working on the possibility of new allies in the NDA to regain its hold on power
 isaki kaman jediu ne sanbhali hui he
 Though there has been no response to this offer from the BJD and YSR Congress so far, but these two regional parties are such that they were not seen standing anywhere with the opposition alliance
 karnataka main kumaraswami ke shapath grahan se lekar kolkata main mamata banerjee ke manch par lagbhag sabhi gaiyr-endie dalon ke netaa pahunche the
 But Naveen Patnaik and Jagan Mohan Reddy neither went anywhere nor sent any of their representatives to be a part of the grand alliance picture

 siddharmaiya is baat par jor de rahe hai ki unhone isi saal farvari main jo bajet pesh kiya tha, use lekar hi aage badha jaae
 The new budget should be replaced by a supplementary budget
 siddharmaiya kii is maang ko jedies supremeo ech di devgauda tak khaarij kar chuke hai
 This is the reason for Siddaramaiah's displeasure? a video of Siddaramaiah about the budget presented by Kumaraswamy also went viral
 is videon main ve bol rahe the ki kumaraswami bajet banaakar use congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi se sweekruti lenge
 Siddaramaiah was seen expressing displeasure with some Congress mlas for presenting the new budget
 in donon video ke saamne aane ke baad gathbandhan saajhedaaron main asahaj sthiti paidaa ho gai he
 Crisis on Kumaraswamy Government? Actually, even though the congress-jds coalition government has been formed under the leadership of Kumaraswamy in Karnataka, everything is not going well between the two parties

 For the last few days, Siddaramaiah has been continuously expressing his dissatisfaction with CM Kumaraswamy

 Many party mlas are dissatisfied with the absence of a minister
 kumaraswami kii cabinet main congress cote ke 6 mantriyon kii jagah abhi bhi khaali hai
 Major Gogoi did exactly what he did
 supreme court ke adeshon ke tahat hi major ne karrwai kii
 Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi said this to NDTV India
 unhone kaha ki supreme court ke aadesh hai ki atyaadhik bal istemaal na ho
 This is the best example of how to overcome the situation using minimum force
 ek vyakti ko shield na banaate to janmaal kaa nuksaan hota
 On 27 April, the central government was shocked by the Supreme Court when the Supreme Court rejected the curative petition of the central government in the Manipur case
 supreme court ne faisle main badlaav karne se inkaar kiya jisamen kaha gaya tha ki sena yaa police atyaadhik bal kaa istemaal nahin kar sakati
 The comments manipur main sena dwaara encounter karne ke maamle main centre sarkaar supreme court pahunchi thi
 a curative petition was filed against the July 2016 decision of the Supreme Court
 centre ne kaha tha ki is faisle par phir se vichaar kiya jaae nahin to militant ke khilaaf sena ke aaparishan par asar padegaa
 Even this order is affecting the provisions of AFSPA
 darasal supreme court ne kaha tha ki sena yaa police aise maamalon main acces power kaa istemaal nahin kar sakati or aatmaraksha ke liye nunatam bal yani force kaa istemaal kiya jaae
 On behalf of the Center, AG Mukul Rohatgi said that in such a state where militant insurgency is going on, it is not a question of self-defense but of attacking
 iskaa asar uttar purvi rajyon or jammu-kashmir main padataa he jahaan AFSPA laga hua he
 In such areas, the army has to attack rather than self-defense to carry out operations
 isliye supreme court apane aadesh par phir se gaur kare or is par jald sunwaayee ho
 Earlier, the Supreme Court has also dismissed the review petition
 27 april ko centre sarkaar ko supreme court se jhatka laga tha jab manipur maamle main supreme court ne centre sarkaar kii curative pitishan khaarij kii thi
 The Supreme Court refused to change the judgment, stating that the army or police could not use excessive force
 tippaniyan The central government had reached the Supreme Court in Manipur for an encounter with the army
 supreme court ke july 2016 ke faisle ke khilaaf curative pitishan daakhil kii gai thi
 The Center had said that this decision should be reconsidered or else the army's operation against the militants will be affected
 yahaan tak ki yah aadesh AFSPA ke praavdhaanon par bhi asar daal rahaa he
 In fact, the Supreme Court had said that the army or police cannot use the access power in such cases and the minimum force is used for self-defense
 centre kii ore se agi mukul rohtagi ne kaha tha ki jis rajya main militant insergency chal rahi ho aise maamalon main aatmaraksha kaa sawaal nahin balki hamale karne kaa hota he
 This affects North Eastern states and Jammu and Kashmir where AFSPA is in place
 aise ilaakon main sena ko oparation chalaane ke liye aatmaraksha nahin balki hamalaa karnaa hota he
 Therefore, the Supreme Court should revisit its order and it should be heard soon
 isse pehle supreme court punarvichaar yachika bhi khaarij kar chukaa he

 The political war in the BJP and the Congress has continued since the Supreme Court's verdict on the investigation into Judge Loya's death
 ek taraf jahaan congress kaa kahana he ki jaj loya kii maut kaa maamla kaaphi gambhir he, maamle kii nishpaksh jaanch honi chahie
 At the same time, BJP says that the false propaganda of the Congress party has been revealed in the Judge Loya case
 upi ke baliya se bijepi saansad bharat singh ne vivaadit bayaan diya he
 He said that Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and the Congress Party are working at the behest of Christian missionaries
 desh kii janata se maafee maangen rahul gandhibharat singh ne kaha ki jaj loya maamle main congress party ne isai mishanri ke ishaare par hi supreme court main yachika daayar kii thi
 It is the Christian missionaries who control the Congress party
 bijepi saansadane kaha ki isai mishanri se desh kii ekta ko khatra he
 MP Bharat Singh said that Rahul Gandhi should apologize to the people of the country and the media
 gauratlab he ki bijepi ne chif justise deepak mishra ke khilaaf mahabhiyog maamle par bhicongress partyper hamalaa bolaa
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Friday that the Congress and its allies were making political use of impeachment
 vittamantri ne kaha kijaj loya kesamen congress party ke jhuthe propaganda kii pole khul gai he or usee kaa badla lene ke liye yah mahabhiyog prastaav laayaa gaya he
 Bringing this against one judge is trying to give a message to other judges that if you do not agree with us, then 50 mps are enough to take revenge
 asaram baapu
 Do not know how many devotees kept seeing their God in them, but what is it that came out, there is no need to tell
 jodhpur jail main band hai
 The police became active when a minor girl accused them of sexual harassment
 khulaase par khulaase hone lage
 But till today you will reveal the words of the victims and former disciple of Asaram, you will surely be surprised to hear one truth of all the dark deeds of Asaram
 in sawaalon ke ghere main asaram hai or pehali baar gavaahi dene aae hai wo log, jo dharm ke is dhandhebaaj baba ke jhaanse kaa shikaar bane
 So read the meaning of 'asaram' for Asaram's Gurukul and those living in the ashram
 
 
 ashram main rahi peedit ladki kaa bayaanraipur main asaram ke ashram main rahi peedit ladki ne chaunkaane vaala khulaasa kiya he
 The victim told that when Asaram used to come to Raipur ashram, we were hired to serve his refreshments
 tab main skool main thi
 This is 2004
 jab main or meri saathi ladkiyaan asaram ko chaay-naashtaa dene ke liye jate the to vah hamase ashleel baaten karte the
 Used to give different kinds of temptation
 chhedchhad karte the
 The victim said, 'asaram had unwavering faith in the people
 isliye main dar ke maare logon ko ye baat nahin bataa saki, apane maa-baap ko bhi nahin
 Now my faith for every Baba is over
 sab dhongi hai
 Let it be
 asaram ko kadi se kadi sajaa honi chahie
 The victim also said, 'thousands of girls may have fallen prey to their obscene antics but would not have come out in fear
 'vaidya prajapatigujarat main asaram ke ashram main rahe vaidya prajapati ne kaha ki aise kaale karname pichley kareeb 30 saalon se chal rahe hai
 Thousands of girls have sex rackets going on
 1994 main chitra lekha main asaram ke virodh main kuch prakashit hua tha
 In response, Asaram burnt the office of that magazine

 The police have to inquire a lot, so she is not speaking openly
 lekin ajtak ko sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik us video clip main asaram ek ladki ke gardan or kandhe par haath pher rahe hai
 That mobile clip has been sent for scientific investigation
 apane asaram ke liye ye shiva har gunaah main saajheedaar rahaa
 Like Asaram's shadow everywhere
 jodhpur police ko usee shiva se ek aisi sidi ke bare main pataa chalaa, jisase asaram ke anjaane raaj saamne aa sakate hai
 But before that CD, the police have found a video clip from Shiva's mobile phone, which is enough to tell Asaram's intentions and intentions
 ab sawaal uthta he ki asaram kii in tasveeron kaa makasad kya ho saktaa he? kya aisi clip naaballig ladakiyon ko blackmel karne ke liye banaae jate the? kya aisi koshishon ke jariye asaram ladakiyon ko sammohit karte the? yaa ye tasviren mahaj asaram ke aniatik iraadon ko aainaa dikhaa rahe hai?in sawaalon ke bich hi ahmedabad sthit asaram ke ashram se police ko kuch ahm suraag haath lage hai
 According to sources, according to the information received by the police during the interrogation of Shiva, according to him, the way forward for Asaram may be more difficult
 jabaki unke khilaaf mili electronic suraagon kii jaanch abhi baaki he
 Asaram also confessed in the sting operation that Chambal people also visit his ashram

 equity or date aadhaarit mutual fund main antar ko aasaan bhashaa main aise samajha ja saktaa he ki equity itief main aapkaa paisa kisi company main hissedari kharidne main jaataa he, jabaki date main aap us company ko udhaar dete hai
 In this case, debt-based products are considered safer than equities
 buudhvaar ko cabinet ne desh ke pehle korporate bond aadhaarit itief ‘’bharat bond itief’’ ko manjuuri de di he
 Bharat Bond will be the first bond ETF in the country
 isse pehle desh main keval equity aadhaarit itief hi trade hote the
 According to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, this will provide an additional source of funds to government companies and institutions
 bharat bond itief ke antargat sarkari sansthaaon kii ore se jari bond trade kiye ja sakenge
 The unit price of ETF will be Rs 1000, so that small investors can take maximum stake in it
 is itief ke antargat macurity kii do samyavadhi hai pehali teen varsh or duusari aath varsh
 How safe are these etfs launched in the country for investors? And what should an investor keep in mind while investing? Jitendra Solanki is a certified financial planner answering these questions
 finanntial planar jitendra solanki kehete hai, 'is itief main nivesh se pehle niveshkon ko yah bhalibhanti samaj lenaa chahie ki yah bond bazaar se judaa itief he
 This will be the first time that the general public will be able to connect with the bond market
 "right now the products related to the bond market are not very popular in the country
 aise main bharat bond itief nishchit taur par chote niveshkon ko aakarshith kar saktaa he
 Gold and equity-based etfs are already traded in the market, making investors familiar with ETF products
 bond itief main kaise ritern kii ummid?paramparaagat nivesh madhyam masalan bank diposit aadi kii tulana main bond itief achche ritern de sakate hai
 However, etfs with maturity of 3 years will be able to beat the inflation rate

 Is there any risk in investment? Only bonds with triple a rating of Navratna companies will trade in Bharat Bond ETF
 yani jokhim simit he
 But liquidity in this product can be a problem
 yani log jab chahen tab unhen itief bechney main mushkil kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he yaa unhen maujuuda bazaar bhav se neeche bikwaali kerani pad sakati he
 Investors should assess the liquidity position in the bond ETF before investing
 10 saal kii avadhi vaale bond nivesh ke liye kaise?lambii avadhi main ye bond mahangaai ko maat dekar puunji ko surakshit rakh sakate hai
 Returns ranging from 7 to 8 percent are expected in these bonds
 10 saal kii avadhi share bazaar main nivesh ke lihaaj se bhi behatar he
 One can get good returns over the same period by investing there
 haalanki vahaan jokhim zyada he
 At a time when the interest rate on deposits is going down, then opening the debt market to small investors may be better in terms of investment options
 lekin inke prati jaagarukta badhaane liye satat prayaas jaruri hai

 According to the notice, two channels broadcast the content without any independent verification about the complaint

 According to the notice, the intern worked barely three to four days in his office

 yahaan ek ladki ne apane bwoyfriend ko shaadi ke liye prapoj kiya
 The boyfriend refused to marry due to family pressure
 gusse main aakar ladki ne apane bwoyfriend kaa privet part kaat daalaa
 The case is from Mangolpuri area of delhi
 aaropee ladki (23) apane bwoyfriend (35) ke saath pichley 4 saal serilationshipsmein thi
 According to the information received, the girl's family had proposed marriage in front of the boy's family members
 ladke ke gharavaalon ne is shaadi se inkaar kar diya
 Even after this, the girl's family did not lose courage
 is bich unhone kai baar ladke ko samajhane kii koshish kii
 On Wednesday night, the girl's sister-in-law called the young man and called him home
 donon pariwaron kaa ghar aasapaas hi tha, lihaaja yuvak unke ghar pahunch gaya
 The girl took the young man to another room on the pretext of talking and started pressing for marriage
 aarope he ki ladki ne shaareerik sambandh banane kaa dabaav daalaa
 When the boy refused, she got angry and brought a vegetable cutting knife from the kitchen and brutally cut the boy's private part

 Earthquake scientists have warned that the region along the Himalayas is under extreme pressure from Himachal Pradesh, Garhwal, Kumaon, Nepal to Sikkim and further east in the west

 This causes small earthquakes to occur at intervals of large earthquakes as rocks move to reduce pressure

 valdia kaa kahana he ki is tarah ke bhubhag badi hui bhugarbheey gatividhiyon ke ''geyodinemic hotspot'' hai jahaan bhavishya main vinaashkari bukamp aa sakate hai
 Such fragile centers exist in the plains of the Ganges, the coast of the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, as well as areas far from the coastline

 Clear conventions about the danger spots appear everywhere

 In Bihar, the 2008 Kosi river diverted its flow to an empty path and due to this, floods caused great destruction
 bhuvaigyanikon kaa kahana he ki bhoomi ke doobane yaa ubharne kii vajah se nadiyon kii gati dhimi ho jaati he yaa ve apni raah badal leti hai
 It is a matter of conviction that cracks in the rock layers below the ground have started to stir, which can eventually cause earthquakes
 pahaado main kai jhranon ke sookhne ke baad march, 1999 main chamoli main bukamp aayaa jisamen 103 log maare gaye
 The region experienced landslides several times during the dry season due to frequent earthquakes which are not easily known
 valdia kaa kahana he ki ye donon hi baaten jameen ke bheetar uthalputhal kaa sankawt detii he jiske kaaran bada bukamp aata he
 Paleocene seismic features (ancient earthquake effects that are protected in rocks) are always associated with fragile sites
 bihar main janvari, 1934 main aae 8
 There were at least three major earthquakes of 1,700 and 25,000 years before a devastating earthquake of 4 magnitude
 isi tarah 2,800 se 6,000 saal pehle bukamp sambandhi kai pracheen ghtnaaon ke aks pashchimi bharat main vadodara or dadar ghati ke aasapaas chattaanon ke dhaanche main dekhe ja sakate hai jinke baad janvari, 2001 main bhuj main vinaashkari bukamp aayaa jisamen kareeb 20,000 log maare gaye
 The sinking of the ocean floor in the vicinity of Andaman Island caused a severe tsunami in December 2004, causing devastation in the coastal areas of India, Sri Lanka and Indonesia
 bharat kaa bukamp sambandhi nakshaa purana or avishwasaneey ho gaya he
 It is based on incomplete records in which only major earthquakes are recorded
 valdia chetavanee dete hai ki is tarah ke aankadon ke aadhaar par badi pariyojnaon khaas taur se parmaanu sanyantron or bade baandhon kii yojana bananaa ''khatarnaak'' he
 Indian geologists are calling for a "concrete change" in the country's outlook about earthquakes
 ve is baat par jor dete hai ki physiographic badlaavon, bhuskhalan ke swaroopon, nadiyon ke bahane ke tareekon, peleio seismicity se lekar jameen ke neeche ucch dabaav kaa sankawt dene vaali radon gas ke utsarjan ke bare main tamaam tarah kii uplabdh jaankaree kaa istemaal kiya chahie
 Ironically, the old law citing national security concerns has restricted access to maps of all coastal and border areas, hampering geological research
 is baat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ki internet par is tarah ke aankade hasil karnaa kitna aasaan he, ye pratibandh aaj haasyaaspad lagate hai
 Regular monitoring is important to improve information about earthquake losses so that planners can protect large projects from tsunamis and earthquakes as well as choose safe locations
 himachal pradesh main bhakhda baandh, jahaan se chaar rajyon ko bijli kii aapurti or sinchai hoti he, iskaa ek makul udhaaharan he, jahaan america ejeeniyar harvey slocum ne 1950 ke dashak ke aakhir main is vishaal dhaanche ko sthir rakhane ke liye bhuvaigyanik akalan kiya tha
 The dam site is at the base of clay in a zone of cracked rocks in earthquake sensitive areas
 slocum ne yahaan kai maheene bitaye or asthir mitti ke harek inch kii khudaai kii or isaki jagah mitti kii chattan ke neeche kai ton thos kancreet dalwakar, aisa intjaam karavaaya taaki baandh par bukamp kaa koi asar na ho
 Like his other colleagues, Valdiya also believes that seismological monitoring should be brought under a national authority free from bureaucratic or political pressure
 abhi bhartiya mausam vibhaag ek kendriya agency he jo sunami samet bukamp sambandhi gatividhiyon ko record karti he
 But the agency does not monitor minor earthquakes
 desh main aisi koi pranali nahin he jo nadiyon ke bahaav main parivartan, bhuskhalan, achaanak hone vaale utsarjan or isse jude duusare tathyon kaa jayja le sake or unka baqayada byora rakh sake
 
 valdia kaa kahana he, ''ham payaarvaran kanoonon ke kisi bhi tarah ke ulanghan par to badi aapattiyaan jataate hai lekin hamamen se zyaadaatar log pariyojnaon kii jagahon ko lekar ajeeb tarah se udasin hai jo hamaare paryaavaran ke liye nuksandeh ho sakate hai

 kings 11 punjab pehali baar apane ghar mohali main cricket match khilne pahunche or ummid thi ki kam se kam yahaan ki oochaal bhari pich se team ko kuch phayda pahonchega
 But nothing happened Punjab's team lost by 20 runs
 team ne pehle glan maxwell ko baahar kar sabko chaunkaaya tha, to kal ke match main virendra sahvaag bhi bench par baithe muskuraate hi nazar aae
 The changes that Punjab made were of no use
 vaise hi shahar se kaaphi dur hone kii vajah se kam hi log mohali ke stadium main ipel kaa match dekhne pahunchate hai
 But the team was playing here for the first time this season
 logon ko laga tha ki shaayad team ko apane phens kii hausala afzai kii zaroorat thi lekin hua kuch bhi nahin
 The real problem of the team is his batting which looks absolutely dull
 saat maichon main team kii ore se sirf chaar ardhshtak bane hai
 The performance of Indian batsmen in particular has been disappointing
 na to abhi tak sahvaag kaa balla chalaa, na hi murali vijay kisi kaam aa rahe hai
 The comments team videshi khilaadiyon par zarurat se zyaada nirbhar kar rahi he lekin gharelu khilaadiyon kii naakaami ko bhala wo kab tak chupa paaenge

 Kings 11 Punjab arrived in Mohali for the first time to play a cricket match and it was expected that at least the bouncy pitch here will give some benefit to the team
 lekin hua kuch nahin punjab kii team 20 ranon se haar gai
 The team first surprised everyone by dropping Glenn Maxwell, then in yesterday's match Virender Sehwag was seen smiling as he sat on the bench
 punjab ne jo bhi badlaav kiye wo kisi kaam ke nahin the
 Similarly, due to being far away from the city, few people reach the stadium of Mohali to watch the IPL match
 par team pehali baar yahaan is sizan main khel rahi thi
 People felt that maybe the team needed the courage of its fans but nothing happened
 team kii asli samasya uski ballebaazi he jo bilkul feeki nazar aati he
 Only four fifties have been scored by the team in seven matches
 khaskar bhartiya ballebaazon kaa pradarshan niraash kar dene vaala rahaa he
 Neither the bat of Sehwag has been played yet, nor Murali Vijay is of any use
 tippaniyan The team is relying excessively on foreign players, but how long will they be able to hide the failure of domestic players
 saal 2014 main team final main pahunchi thi or is baar ank talika main phiseddi he
 Perhaps the time has come for the coach and captain to press the panic button

 But have you ever heard that a child chewed his fingers? You might not be able to believe the story of seven-year-old Manisha and five-year-old Dinakal Patel living in Raipur
 in bhai-bahan ko ek durlabh beemaari he jiske chalate unhen kisi dard kaa ehsaas nahin hota he
 These siblings, suffering from a disease called Congenital Insensitivity, do not feel any discomfort
 jis chot se kisi kii cheekh nikal jaae, us chot kaa in donon ko ehsaas tak nahin hota he
 Even if there is a wound, the fear of infection always remains
 kongenital insensitivity ek anuvaanshik beemaari he
 Which is caused by the mutation of the SCN9A gene
 ye ek behad gambhir sthiti he
 One day when the father of the children Gopal Prasad Patel returned from his work, he saw that his children were blood-stained
 patel dar gaye
 Patel says that at first he could not believe that both of them had hurt themselves
 wo donon ghar par khel rahe the or khel-khel main hi donon ne apane haath-pair chaba daale the
 Patel and his wife are laborers
 us din donon kaam par gaye hue the or patel kii maa bacchon kii dekhbhaal kar rahi thim
 When she went to feed the children, she saw that the fingers of the children were severely cut
 unhen dekhakar lag rahaa tha jaise kisi chuuhe ne unki ungaliyon ko kutar daalaa ho
 When Patel returned home, he immediately rushed to the hospital with the children
 uske baad unhen ek duusare bade aspataal main shift kar diya gaya
 Patel's biggest concern at the moment is how he will treat the children
 unhen andaja bhi nahin he ki bacchon ke ilaaj main kitna kharch aayega
 Patel says that it is very sad to see children in this condition
 isse pehle jab bacchon ko chot lagati thi to maa-baap sochate the ki unke bachche bahut bahadur hai
 The children's mother Anita says that no one has ever seen these babies crying since they were born
 is samay bacchon kaa ilaaj kar rahe doctor puranendu saxena kaa kahana he ki in bacchon kii beemaari bahut hi durlabh he or unhen kisi bade aspataal main vishesh ilaaj kii jarurat he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is often found saying that assembly and Lok Sabha elections should be held simultaneously in the country so that the government gets time to work
 alag-alag samay par hone vaale chunaavon or uske pehle kii aachaar samhitaayen sarkaar kaa keemtee vakt barabaad kar detii hai
 The Prime Minister is repeatedly claiming in his public meetings that the BJP is going to win by a huge majority in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections
 bhartiya janata party ke prachaar or netaaon ke bayanon ko maane to mishan 265 se kahin aage jaakar abaki baar, 300 paar vaale naare or daawey party kii ore se kiye ja rahe hai
 Modi is preparing to prepare Purvanchal through Varanasi, this is the strategy
 
 That is, the BJP is confident about its victory in Uttar Pradesh
 koi andeh nahin
 Jeet is decorated in front of the plate
 ab na atishay prachaar kii zarurat he or na hi galiyon, reliyon main vakt barabaad karne kii
 If the BJP believes then it is time for them to prepare early to form this government
 lekin sthiti aisi he nahin
 Varanasi is the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 yahaan kii siton par jo sthiti bani hui he usne party or pradhanmantri donon kii neend uda rakhi he
 If Gujarat is the model for Modi, then Benaras is his land
 or zamin par haar zamin khisakane se kam nahin he
 Perhaps this concern is troubling the party and the Prime Minister
 bhaajapa kaa banaras main prachaar tantra khud isaki chugali karata nazar aata he
 The Prime Minister's cabinet, which calls for time for the functioning of the government, seems to be moving around in street in Benaras
 ek se ek kendriya mantri, party ke bade netaa, prabandhak or jaateey ganit ke hisaab se anukool chehre, sabko line banaakar banaras main utaar diya gaya he
 It seems that the BJP is actually taking the entire army against any Alexander in Benares
 use haar kaa bhay he
 He is worried about survival and saving the citadel
 agar aisa nahin hota to pradhanmantri sahit cabinet ke tamaam netaaon ko banaras main dar-dar dastak dene kii kya zarurat thi
 He kept on doing his work in Delhi
 pradesh or zile ke bhaajapa netaa apana prachaar kaa kaam jari rakhte
 The government would do its work, the party would do its work
 ek jite hue chunaav ke liye jaan laga dena khud aatmavishvaas kii kami kaa khulaasa karata he
 Smriti Irani is engaged in helping women, leave Ravi Shankar Prasad, Dharmendra Pradhan, Modi has come to the field with his full trinity (modi, Shah and Jaitley)
 pradhanmantri rodsho karenge, reliyaan karenge, baaki log chauraahon, konon par puri-sabzi or chaay kii dukaanon tak maahaul banane ke liye utaar die gaye hai
 Here the question is not only about the difference between words and actions
 chintaa kaa vishay yah bhi he ki jab bajet se lekar nitiyon tak dilli main bahut kuch sanbhaalane or tay karne ko baaki he to phir puri sarkaar ko banaras main kyon jhonka ja rahaa he
 How appropriate it is
 pehle ke pradhanmantriyon ne bhi kya aisa kiya he or agar kiya bhi he to ek jame-jamaaye pradhanmantri ko is tarah desh kii sarkaar ko kshetra kii ladaai main jhonk dena kya naitik or uchit he
 Power is achieved by creating, decorating and showing the magic of dreams
 lekin satta main aane ke baad sapanom or kathanon ke bajaay saakaar hoti chizein or kerani ke aadhaar par moolyankan hota he
 The central government's full entry into one area and indulging in publicity is a sign of weakening power in this assessment
 modi khud bataa rahe hai ki lahar kho chuki he, ab zamin bachaana zaruri he

 Should elections to Lok Sabha and state assembly be held simultaneously in India? Or would it be against the principle of parliamentary democracy, weakening the framework of the Indian Constitution in view of the underlying concept of a five-year term fixed for the Lok Sabha as well as the State Legislative Assembly? Is it possible to form a political consensus on this issue and make a constitutional amendment in this regard? Ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Pranab Mukherjee have expressed their support for the effort in this direction, the issue has come to the center of national debate

 ateet main loksabhaa or rajya vidhansabhaon ke chunaav saath-saath karaae jane ke mudde par vibhinn netaaon kii ore se uthaae gaye vichaar par kuch sarkari ayog bhi charchaa kar chuke hai
 The name of Venkatachaliah Commission in 2002 and Natchiappan Commission in 2015 can be taken
 aitihaasik rup se dekhen to pehle chaar loksabhaa chunaav—1952, 1957, 1962 or 1967—rajya vidhansabhaon ke saath-saath karaae gaye the, sirf kuch ikke-dukke apwaadon ko chhodkar
 The cycle of elections changed in 1968 and 1969 after the Congress rule led by Indira Gandhi sacked non-congress governments in several states
 har koi is baat se sahamat he ki saath-saath chunaav karaane kaa vichaar acha he
 In view of the huge expenditure of elections, it has become very important to improve the electoral system so that transparency can be brought and election expenses can be reduced
 centre for media studies ke ek anumaan ke anusaar, 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav par 35,000 karod ru
 The expenditure was incurred, which was about 10 times the amount spent by the Election Commission
 2014 ke aankadon ko aadhaar maanate hue prati chunaav har loksabhaa nirvachan kshetra par ausat kharch kareeb 70 karod ru
 And about 10 crores on every assembly constituency (4,033 in 29 states and two union territories Delhi and Puducherry)
 baithta he, yah maanate hue ki loksabhaa or vidhansabha par agar ek hi dar se kharch hota he
 With this, if the expenditure of assembly, municipal and panchayat elections is also added again and again, this figure is Rs 1,00,000 crore
 se bhi upar chalaa jayega (dekhen graphics)
 If this huge expenditure is curbed, it will reduce corruption and weaken the mafia's hold in the electoral system and will help to a great extent in stopping the use of wrong money
 baar-baar hone vaale chunaavon, jinke liye aachaar samhita lagu kerani padati he, kii vajah se sushasan main baadha padi he or nitigat faisle nahin liye ja sake hai
 President Pranab Mukherjee during his speech on 5 September had pointed out this aspect on the question of a student
 unhone kaha, ''aaj puure saal kahin na kahin chunaav hote hai or niyamit rup se hone vaale kaam thap ho jate hai, kyonki vahaan par chunaav kii aachaar samhita lagu ho jaati he
 This not only stops work in the state, but also halt the work in the central government

 The 2014 election manifesto of the BJP stated in the section on "institutional Reform": "the BJP would like to find a way through which the assembly and Lok Sabha elections can be held simultaneously" through dialogue with other parties
 " ghoshnaa patr main aam sahmati ko saaf-saaf vyakt kiya gaya tha
 The Prime Minister reiterated the proposal at a conference of Chief Ministers and Chief Justices of the High Court in April and he has expressed it in two of his interviews on television
 lekin unke virodhiyon kaa maananaa he ki ek saath chunaav karaane kaa vichaar uchit nahin he
 According to one, if a government falls into a no-confidence motion or if President's rule comes into force in a state under Article 356, it leaves no room for by-elections or mid-term elections
 samvidhan kii jaankaar vakil indira jaisingh ke mutabik, yah ek rajnatik kadam he
 At a time when the BJP is neither in the Rajya Sabha nor in most of the state assemblies, it is hoping that it will lead to a national wave across the country in favor of one party or person — such as the Modi wave in 2014
 To be taken advantage of
 june main jab vidhi mantralay ne apni raay jaahir kii thi to chunaav ayog ne bhi centre or rajya ke chunaavon ko saath-saath karaae jane ke vichaar kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Veeravalli Sundaram Sampath, who was the chairman of the Election Commission between 2012 and 2015, believes that the idea of holding elections together is good, but it is unrealistic
 unka suzav he ki yah zyada acha hoga, ''agar ek hi saal main hone vaale sabhi vidhansabha chunaavon ko saal ke ek-chauthai hisse main karaayaa ja sake taaki baaki ke teen hisse chunaav se mukt hon
 "he also feels that this will make it easier for the state assemblies controlled by the same political party, such as BJP, to go to the polls simultaneously
 samvidhan ke kaary kii samiksha ke liye rashtriya ayog (venkatchalaiya ayog) kii masauda samiti ke purv adhyaksh subhash kashyap is vichaar ke sabase bade samarthak hai
 According to him, this will reduce the expenditure on elections by less than half
 is ayog ne ek saath chunaav ke mudde par gahan vichaar kiya tha
 Experts suggest amending the constitution in Articles 83 (term of Parliament), 85 (adjournment and abolition of Parliamentary session), 172 (term of Legislative Assembly) and 174 (adjournment and abolition of Assembly session) to make the process To be brought back on track par kashyap kaa maananaa he ki iske liye samvidhan main sanshodhan karne se zyada siyaasi ichhashakti kii jarurat he
 For this, initiatives can be taken by the government itself, such as holding simultaneous elections in BJP ruled states
 is aapatti ko khaarij karte hue ki aisa karne se paanch saal kii nishchit avadhi se sansadeey loktantr kii prakruti ko chot pahonchegi, loksabhaa ke purv mahasachiv kashyap ''rachanaatmak aalochana" kii avadharana kii pairvi karte hai
 Thus a vote of no confidence against a government will automatically create an alternative majority government
 germany or japan main lagu is tarah kii vyavastha ek saath chunaav karaane kaa rasta aasaan kar degi kyonki tab vidhansabha paanch saal se pehle bhang nahin hongi, bhale hi unka netritv badal saktaa he
 Critics of this view believe that the five-year fixed-term doctrine is against the democratic spirit of representation
 vakil manu singhvi kaa maananaa he ki ek saath chunaav karaane kaa vichaar saidhantik rup se acha prathit hota he par vyaavhaarik nahin he
 He says, "due to repeated elections, there is a need for a system and stability and in this way it feels good to hold elections together, but if it affects the spirit of democracy then the name of the system But no agreement can be reached on the matter of democracy
 " vakil kapil sibbal bhi is baat se puri tarah sahamat hai
 "conducting simultaneous elections is conceptually good, but given the basic spirit of the parliamentary system, simultaneous elections are neither practical nor feasible," he says
 " ve maanate hai ki ek saath chunaav karaane kaa vichaar sansad main kabhi paarit nahin ho paaegaa
 Jaisingh is of the same opinion
 ve kahati hai, ''sansad yaa rajya vidhansabha ke liye paanch saal kii nishchit avadhi vaidhanik rup se asambhav he, kyonki sansadeey vyavastha ke centre main pratinidhi sarkaar he, jiskaa asli matlab he ki samprabhutaa janata par ashrith he

 "he says that this proposal is not only far-fetched, but also a violation of the system of parliamentary accountability, as it challenges the basic structure of the Constitution
 "to centre or rajyon main ek saath chunaav karaane kii bahes kis nattejey par pahunchaati he? jahaan har koi is baat se sahamat he ki yah vichaar acha he or isse paisa or vakt kii bachat hogi, kaam ke liye zyada vakt milegaa, vahiin ek chintaa he ki kya isse samvidhan kii mul bhaavana ko chot pahunchati he
 These differences can be overcome by constitutional amendment and political consensus
 aakhir jab guds and services tex par sahmati banaai ja sakati he to koi kaaran nahin ki chunavi sudhaar ke mudde par aam sahmati nahin banaai ja sake
 a national debate on this and some small steps, such as the suggestion of CEC Sampath that holding elections to all the Legislative Assembly in a year, may be a big step in this direction

 mujhe shame aati hai ki is tarah kaa bayaan ke itane bade pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri ne diya he

 Referring to the controversy over Hanuman being called a Dalit, the BJP MLA said, 'there is talk of dividing Hanuman ji into caste-religion, but the reality is that he belonged to the whole world and every religion
 hamaara maananaa he ki hanuman ji muslim the
 Therefore, the name that is given inside Muslims is similar to the word Hanuman
 ' unhone kaha ki hanuman se milte julate naam sirf islam main hi rakhe jate hai
 The BJP MLA also said, 'many Muslims have also built Hanuman's temples in Uttar Pradesh capital Lucknow

 Now you should not be confused, first see all viral tweets and know how the arguments of the user or others are confusing people
 a maths meme that is actually funny rather than stupid:solve carefully!230 - 220 x 0
 5 = You probably won't believe it but the answer is 5! # Maths — KJ Cheetham ❄️ # FBPE 🔶 (@kj_cheetham) July 13, 2019 Ok, if you are solving it in such a way that 230 - 220 = 10 Then 0 it

 This way the solution is - 220 x 0
 5 = 110 or is aankade ko ghataaen: 230-110 = 120no, it’s 120, unless it’s written (230-220) x 0

 sibiai jaanch kii maangaajtak se khaas baatcheet main tejasvi yadav kaa kahana he ki kai maamalon main sibiai jaanch kar rahi he lekin abhi tak uskaa koi rigelt nahin aayaa he
 Even if it is an important matter like creation scam
 lekin sibiai se badi desh main koi jaanch agency nahin he
 In this case, the CBI should be investigated under the supervision of the court
 tejasvi yadav kaa kahana he ki is maamle main mukhya aaropee sanstha kaa sanchaalak brajesh thakur kai rasukhdaar logon kaa kareebi hone ke saath bihar ke upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi kaa bhi kareebi he

 dijipi ne bataaya ki sanstha main rah raheen 44 ladakiyon main se 42 kii medical jaanch karai gai thi jisamen se 29 bacchiyon ke saath dushkarm kii pushti hui he
 Siddiqui said that the Janta government is going to be spit on the issue that there was a lot of uproar in the Bihar Assembly on Tuesday in the case of sexual exploitation of girls in the girls' house in Muzaffarpur
 sadan ke shuru hote hi pramukh vipakshi dal argedy ne is maamle ko uthaate hue sibiai jaanch kii maang kii or kaha ki yah jaanch patna hoicourt kii nigaraanee main taaki dudh kaa dudh or pani kaa pani ho sake
 Senior RJD leader Abdul Bari Siddiqui said that Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh is ready to investigate the matter with the CBI
 aise main rajya sarkaar sibiai jaanch kii anushansa kyon nahin kar rahi he
 Siddiqui said that this is such a big and disgusting incident that if the statement of girls is made public then the people will spit on the government
