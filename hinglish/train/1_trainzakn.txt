 This rhetoric that has been going on for the last three months has made Muslims like aap's vote bank in Delhi
 atishyokti na samajhen to lagbhag sau fisadi muslim vot aam aadmi party ko gaya
 In a year-and-a-year, the BJP has to fight the war of Bihar and Bengal
 to aage ke liye sanket kya hai?1
 Forget the lesson of Uttar Pradesh: Modi got the support of Muslims in Uttar Pradesh during the Lok Sabha elections despite allegations of Gujarat riots
 mujffarnagar dangon ke baad ve sattadhari samaajawaadee party se naaraaz the, kyonki usne dangon ke dauraan or baad main santoshjanak karrwai nahin kii thi
 Muslims liked Modi's point that they focus on development, not religion
 muslim premi hone ko dikhaava nahin karte
 Imam Bukhari from Delhi elections when Muslims asked him to vote for AAP in Delhi
 to shaayad ho saktaa he ki kai musalamaanon ko yah acha na laga ho
 But when Kejriwal shied away from this statement, the Muslim voter openly came with AAP
 vikaas kii ummid main
 2
 nirankush hai saansad, shaayad na samajhen :sadhvi niranjana jyoti, sakshi maharaj, yogi adityanath bijepi ke saansad hai
 But the headlines for the last three months are only due to his controversial statements
 muslimon kii badhati aabaadi par sawaal uthaanaa, hinduon ko zyada bachche paidaa karne ke liye kahana, lav-jehad or anya maamalon par tikhi baaten karnaa
 Many times it has come out that Prime Minister Modi has duped his mps for making controversial statements and instructed them not to do so
 ho saktaa he aisa kiya bhi ho
 But the effect did not show
 behad sakht maane jane vaale modi kii yadi ye tab nahin sun rahe the to aage kya sunenge
 3
 baaki hindu sanghathan control se baahar :modi jab gujarat ke mukhyamantri the to vahaan na sirf bijepi, balki sangh bhi unki marji se kaam karata tha
 Many Sangh leaders, whom Modi did not trust, were expelled from the state
 lekin desh kii satta sanbhaalane ke baad unke liye yah itnaa aasaan nahin he
 Organizations like Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, VHP, Bajrang Dal, Hindu Mahasabha and their leaders are moving forward with their respective agendas
 baat kar rahe hai
 Regardless of what effect it will have on the political politics of the BJP
 khaastaur par tab jabaki in sabhi sanghathanon ko bijepi se jodakar hi dekha jaataa he
 Now these organizations have to maintain their existence
 bijepi kii bijepi jane

 bihar or bengal main nirnaayak muslim vot :bihar kii 243 vidhansabha siton main se 60 siton par jeet-haar kaa faisla muslim hi karte hai
 Provided they are in favor of one party
 congress ke patan ke baad se ye pehle argedy or janata dal united ke bich bante rahe
 The Muslim vote, which has stood with the JDU-BJP alliance for two times in Bihar, expecting development and peace, is now at the crossroads
 jediu or bijepi ke aamane-saamne ho jane ke baad
 If there is a JDU-RJD alliance in the elections, then the situation will be similar for BJP here as in Delhi
 isi tarah agle saal hone vaale pashchim bengal chunaav ke liye bijepi ne abhi se kadi mehnat shuru kar di he
 In any event, there is tension between BJP worker and Trinamool workers
 vamapanthiyon ko peeche dhakelte hue bijepi yahaan chunavi jang main trinmul ko sidhi takkar dena chaahati he
 But here too, Muslims decide the fate of 25 percent of the 294 seats
 jo pehle vamapanthiyon ke saath the, or ab trinmul ke saath
 The BJP wants to divert the majority Hindu vote in its favor by targeting Bangladeshi infiltrators here, but now it is too early to say that it will come with the BJP

 Congress-like appeasement, Congress-like culmination: Congress is accused of deceiving Muslims in the name of secularism
 nateeja, congress ke paksh main ekatarfa girane vaala yah vot usase hameshaa ke liye chhitak gaya
 During the Lok Sabha elections, a confidence was raised when Modi said that he does not discriminate on religion
 satta main aane ke baad se unhone na to aisa kuch kiya or na hi aisa kaha, jisase lage ki ve musalamaanon se koi bhedbhaav karte hai
 But the way his colleagues are constantly talking about Muslims, it is affecting their image
 jaise congress par tushtikaran kaa daag laga, vaise hi kahin modi par neutral hone kaa dikhaava karne kaa daag na lag jaae
 And do not destroy the plans of spreading beyond the Hindi speaking states

 Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia attacked the Chief Minister Shivraj in Indore, calling him the biggest imposter of Madhya Pradesh
 sindhiya ne kaha, 'main shivaraj kii tarah ghoshnavir nahin hum
 On Monday, Scindia said at an election meeting of the Congress at Musakhedi intersection in Indore that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seated at the center as a great honor, in Uttar Pradesh as Yogi ji (chief Minister Yogi Adityanath) and in Madhya Pradesh as Shivraj
 Are the biggest creeps
 'unhone ne kaha ki shivaraj ne mukhyamantri ke rup main 21 hajaar aisi ghoshnaaen kii, jinamein se ek bhi jameen par nahin utar sakin
 i am not a declarator like Shivraj
 sindhiya ne pradesh kii badahaal sadakon ke lekar shivaraj sarkaar ko gherte hue kaha ki bade-bade gaddhon ke kaaran soobe kii sadaken maut ke gaddhon main badal gai hai, lekin shivaraj kehete hai ki ye sadaken america kii sadakon se behatar hai
 He said that the Chief Minister, who is always in Udan Khatole, from the height of 20 thousand feet, the road pit also looks soft as velvet
 sindhiya ne kaha ki ucch shiksha hasil karne vaale yuvaaon kii ankasuchee berogari ke praaanpatr main badal gai hai or 40 lakh noujvaan aajeevika ke liye dar-dar bhatak rahe hai
 Encircling the central government on demonetisation, he said that it took Prime Minister Narendra Modi one day that he should take a stormy step and he decided to ban demonetisation but this step has ruined the lives of many daily laborers

 com / hs8y3h700l dhire-dhire yah saaf hota ja rahaa he ki rahul gandhi hi congress ke agle sarvesarva honge
 The party may be happy with this decision, but NCP chief Sharad Pawar, his partner in UPA 1 and 2, is angry
 darasal, daagi netaaon par adhyadesh par rahul gandhi ne saarvajanik taur par virodh jataakar khud kii bhrashtachar virdohi chhavi banaai
 On the other hand, Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan is trying to sidestep the NCP in the state through political manipulation
 is paristhiti ko lekar ensipi netaa asahaj hai, khaskar sharad pavaar
 According to NCP sources, Sharad Pawar mentioned his displeasure during the meeting of NCP minister and members of the party's core committee
 darasal, dilli kii siyasat kii jimmedaari sharad pavaar or prafull patel par rahi he
 Notably, Praful Patel and Sonia Gandhi's political secretary Ahmed Patel ensured the smooth running of a coalition in Maharashtra and at the Center, but now Ahmed Patel has backed down on key issues like seat sharing between ncp-congress in Maharashtra
 ensipi ke ek varisht netaa ne bataaya ki ahamed patel ne hi pichley loksabhaa chunaav main 26-22 ke formule par aakhri muhar lagaai thi, par ab jab sthaneey congress netritv seat bantwaare par nae formule kii maang kar rahaa he to ahamed patel peeche hat gaye hai, or ensipi netritv ko jaankaree di he ki seat bantwaare ko lekar ab congress ke nae netritv se baat kerani hogi
 Sources said that Pawar expressed his displeasure by saying, "there is confusion about who to talk to in Congress
" 'sharad paravaar ne party netaaon ko chunaavon kii taiyaari karne ko kaha he
 The party wants to field with the Congress in the upcoming elections, but the NCP is in a tizzy about the leadership change in the Congress
 iske alaava do hafte pehle maharashtra daure ke dauraan rahul gandhi dwaara die gaye bayaan ne bhi aag main ghi daalane kaa kaam kiya, jisamen congress upaadhyaksh ne kaha tha ki agar ham apane dam par bahumat laate hai to hamen ensipi kii jarurat nahin
 If the alliance breaks with the NCP, Maharashtra may come out of the hands of the Congress
 donon partiyon kaa netritv yah jaanata he ki agar unhen maharashtra main satta chahie to unke paas saath bane rahane ke alaava koi upaay nahin he
 But NCP feels that Congress is not giving them importance
 pichley do saalon main soobe ke mukhiya prithviraj chavaan ne ensipi ko asahaj sthiti main daalane kaa koi mauka nahin choda
 Whether it is action against the state cooperative bank which Ajit Pawar used to run, or a statement about the state's poor irrigation situation
 log maanate hai ki prithviraj chavaan ne jaanboojhkar ensipi dwaara sanbhale ja rahe mantralayon or unke netaaon par nishaanaa saadhane kii ranneeti apanaai
 At the same time, Sharad Pawar himself has expressed his displeasure over the working style of the chief of the state in strong words
 ab jab chunaav najadik hai or congress ke zyaadaatar saathi saath chhodkar ja chuke hai, party nae netritv ko lekar ensipi main asahajata badhati ja rahi he
 In such a situation, if the Congress and NCP have to successfully face the challenge of Narendra Modi in Maharashtra, then this issue has to be resolved
 dilli vidhansabha chunaav ke lienamakan kii prakriya pureeki ja chuki he
 Everyone has 15 days to campaign for the election, so the era of rallies and meetings has started gaining momentum

 Describing Kiran Bedi as the 'hired captain', he has described Narendra Modi as 'gabbar'

 The drugs sent by the Majithia dynasty are in the veins of the young men in Punjab

 khabaron ke mutabik, is movie main vicky ke apojit sara ali khan ko approach kiya gaya
 But due to lack of role in the role, the actress refused to be a part of it
 centre kii modi sarkaar satta me chaar saal puure karke chunavi varsh me pravesh kar chuki he
 In such a situation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself is getting to know about the achievements of his government
 isi kram main apane do divasiy purvanchal yatra ke duusare din piem modi mirzapur main 4 badi pariyojnaon kii saugat di
 Here, PM Modi inaugurated the Bansagar project as well as the foundation stone of 108 Jan Aushadhi Kendra, Medical College and the bridge connecting Benares and Mirzapur in Chunar
 mirzapur ke chanaipur gaanv main yojit ek kaarykram main bansagar pariyojna ke locarpan ke saath mirzapur me banane vaale medical college kii aadharshila rakhi
 Addressing the rally here for four decades, planningpm Modi said that this area has always been an area of possibilities and now the state seems to be developing after the coming of Yogi ji's government in UP
 unhone kaha ki beete 2 dinon main is kshetra ke liye vikaas se judi tamaam parijaanaaon kii shuruyaat kii gai yaa phir unhen janata ko samarpit kiya gaya
 Describing the achievements of the Bansagar project, PM Modi said that if this scheme had started earlier, you would have got this benefit 2 decades ago, but earlier governments did not worry about the farmers
 unhone kaha ki 40 saal pehle is pariyojna kaa shilanyas hua tha lekin kaam shuru hote-hote 20 saal nikal gaye lekin yojana par sirf baaten or vaade kiye gaye
 He said that in 2014 our government worked to start all the stuck, bhatki and latki schemes
 piem modi ne kaha ki ek or antarrashtriya report ai he jisamen kaha gaya he ki beete 2 saal main bharat main 5 karod log bheeshan garibi se baahar nikle hai
 There is also a big impact of the government's schemes which are reducing the expenses of the poor
 unhone kaha ki jo log aajkal kisaanon ke liye ghadiyaali aansu bahaate hai, unase aapako poochna chahie ki aakhir kyon unhen apane shashan kaal main desh bhar main faili is tarah kii adhuri sinchai pariyojnaayen nahin dikhaai deen? kyon aise kaaryon ko adhuraa hi chhod diya gaya
 The Prime Minister will leave Varanasi Airport from here and will return to Delhi from there
 pariyojnaon kaa saugatgauratlab he ki bansagar pariyojna uttar pradesh ke mirzapur or elahabaad ke acinchit kshetron ke liye khaasaa laabhadaayak sabit hoga
 The PM will also address a public meeting along with the inauguration of the Bansagar project on the Son River
 jisase padosi jile sonbhadra, robertsganj or mirzapur se sate madhyapradesh ko bhi saadhane kaa prayaas karenge
 Let us tell you that the part of Madhya Pradesh of Bansagar project was completed in 2006 which was inaugurated by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee

 According to reports, the film's uneven and very unique script has played an important role in the casting of the film

 Both of them decided to work in this film so that they could make society comfortable about the issue from the point of view of a father and daughter

 The film is directed by Shaily Chopra Dhar
 saath hi is film se ek baar phir se lambey vakt baad anil kupar or juhi chawla kii jodi darshakon ko dekhne ko milegi
 Rajkummar Rao also plays an important role in the film

 Talking about Rajkumar Rao, his film Mantle Hai Kya and Made in China will be released in the year 2019
 salmaan khan kii tivi par jald vaapasi hogi
 There is still time for the next season of Bigg Boss, but in the meantime he is coming on the small screen to show his strength
 kapil ke sho main dabl mining chutkulon ko lekar vivaadon main siddhusalmaan khan kii vaapasi ho rahi he 'das kaa dam' se
 And it is being said that it will replace Kapil Sharma's show
 diene kii ek khabar ke mutabik, deal ho gai to is sho kaa prasaaran july main shuru ho saktaa he
 However, nothing has been said about this officially
 jaankariyaan li karte the bodygards, salmaan ne job se nikalabta den ki salmaan khan 'das kaa dam' ke pehle do sijan, 2008 or 2009 main host kar chuke hai
 The special thing is that Salman Khan works with a special connection with the audience
 jal gai salmaan kii 'tubalite', unke is andaaj par fida ho jaaenge aapvahin yah khabar bhi aa rahi he ki da kapil sharma sho kii girti tiarapy ko dekhte hue channel ne is kamedi sho kaa contract rineau nahin kiya he
 In such a situation, it is being speculated that Kapil's show may stop soon
 sunil grover or ali asagar ke sho chhodane ke baad se channel or kapil sharma ke bich vaise hi tanaav aa chukaa he
 Looking at all these things, it seems that the channel may place its bets on Salman Khan! kalaadhan mudde par vitt mantri arun jetali ke bayaan par congress ne bhi hallaa bolaa he
 The Congress has challenged the government to come out with full information and the party is above the person
 yahi nahin, congress ne kaha kimodi sarkarablackmel karne kaa hatkandaa apnaanaa band kare
 Finance Minister Jaitley had said on Tuesday about disclosing the names of illegal foreign account holders, that this may embarrass the opposition party
 ek din baad congress mahasachiv ajay maakan ne kaha ki sarkaar ko ‘ardhsaty’ or ‘chuninda licage’ se bachanaa chahie
 Maken said, "congress is not going to blackmail from any such threat
 hamen blackmel karne kaa prayaas nahin karen
 Strict action should be taken against whoever is found involved
 lekin yah badale kii bhaavana se prerit nahin hona chahie or yah aadha sach nahin hona chahie
 On the issue of black money, there has been a situation of war between the ruling BJP and the Congress
 sarkaar ne haal hi supreme court ko bataaya tha ki vah swiss bank khataadharakon ke naamon kaa khulaasa nahin kar sakati
 The UPA government had also taken a similar approach earlier
 jab congress ne bijepi sarkaar par is mudde ko lekar ‘paakhand karne’ kaa aarope lagaaya to mangalvaar ko jetali ne kaha ‘naam jald hi saarvajanik kar die jaaenge
 i assure you that when the names are made public, i (BJP) will not feel any shame
 in naamon kii vajah se congress party ko jarur kuch sharmindagi hogi
 Reacting sharply to the statement of 'semi-truth, not true', Maken said, 'congress does not need to blackmail
 unke paas jo bhi naam he uskaa unhen khulaasa karnaa chahie or unhen sarkaar kii tarah karrwai kerani chahie
 They should not try to blackmail us
 ' maakan ne kaha, 'ham unhen yah bhi kahana chaahate hai ki ve naamon kii sankhya ko 136 logon tak simit na karen
 We want to tell the BJP and the Prime Minister that half-truth is not true
 unhen chuninda or durbhaavna se prerit khulaase nahin karne chahie
 They should come up with all the names
 'maakan ne yah bhi yaad dilaayaa ki narendra modi ne loksabhaa chunaav prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan kaha tha ki yadi kalaadhan waapas laayaa jaataa he to har naagarik ko 15 lakh rupee milenge, jabaki grahamantri rajnath singh ne 100 din ke bheetar kalaadhan waapas laane kaa vaada kiya tha
 100 days have already passed
 ab to 150 din hone vaale hai or ek paisa bhi waapas nahin aayaa he
 Rejecting Jaitley's remarks, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh accused Jaitley of 'bluffing' the people, while Youth Congress President Rajiv Satav wondered what was stopping the Finance Minister from disclosing the names
 loksabhaa chunaav kii tarikhon kaa elaan ho chukaa he or sabhi dalon kii ore se chunavi reliyon ko lekar antim rup diya ja rahaa he
 The Congress, which is trying to return to power, is also hoping for a big victory due to party President Rahul Gandhi and General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra
 congress kii ahmedabad main hui seedblusi baithak ke baad ab priyanka gandhi purvi uttar pradesh ke daure par jane vaali hai
 The full list of official programs regarding party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's upcoming tour of eastern Uttar Pradesh is yet to arrive at the party headquarters in Lucknow, but according to sources she will be visiting eastern Uttar Pradesh from Thursday
 sakriy raajnneeti main aane ke baad priyanka ne pichley maheene 11 farvari ko lakhanu main road sho kiya tha
 He was also accompanied by Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Jyotiraditya Scindia in charge of Western Uttar Pradesh during this road show
 mana ja rahaa he ki priyanka gandhi ne purvi uttar pradesh main apane kaarykram ko lagbhag tay kar liya he
 After the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting, Priyanka will soon leave for a tour of eastern Uttar Pradesh, where she will first visit Prayagraj and from there she will visit Varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 ab ganga ke raste varanasipriyanka gandhi kaa kaarykram sadak ke raste se purvi uttar pradesh main rajnatik reliyon or sabha karne kaa tha, lekin sutron kii maane to priyanka ab prayagraj se varanasi ganga ke raste se ja sakati hai
 If this happens, more than half a dozen parliamentary constituencies will be covered in this route of about 100 kilometers and in a new way she will enter Prime Minister Modi's parliamentary constituency
 sutron ke anusaar, priyanka gandhi kaa kaarykram kuch is tareeke se ho saktaa he
 Priyanka Gandhi will first visit her ancestral home Anand Bhavan during the Prayagraj tour
 phir vah purvi uttar pradesh ke bade congressi netaaon or kaaryakartaaon se milengi
 After that she will first go to Mirzapur by steamer from Prayagraj, where she will see Vindhyavasini Devi and then leave for Varanasi
 aadhikarik taur par congress kii mahasachiv banaae jane ke baad party kii ore se priyanka gandhi ko purvi uttar pradesh kii jimmedaari saunpi gai he
 While the Congress is preparing with the help of Rahul and Priyanka to challenge the BJP, after the alliance of the SP and BSP in the state, it has been cleared by the BSP supremo on Tuesday that their party somehow managed to get the Congress from any state If we do not combine, responsibility has increased on Priyanka
 mangalvaar ko kiya tha pehla twitmana ja rahaa he ki congress jald hi apana jabardast prachaar abhiyaan shuru karne ja rahi he
 Like the BSP, SP President and former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav also made it clear in his interview to a foreign news magazine that there is no time left for any coordination with the Congress as the parties have entered the fray
 saaf he congress uttar pradesh ke chunavi samar main akele hi utregi or vah priyanka ke sahare hogi
 In the simple dignity of Sabarmati, the truth lives on

 Following the Supreme Court's order to reinstate Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) director Alok Kumar Verma, the opposition has launched a fierce attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 congress ne kaha ki modi aise pehle pradhanmantri hai jinke avaidh adeshon ko sheersh court ne khaarij kiya he
 Other political parties also said that this order is a big setback for the government
 congress pravaktaa randeep singh surajevaala ne kaha, pradhanmantri sibiai ko tabah karne ke maamle main supreme court ke saamne benakaab hone vaale pehle pradhanmantri ban gaye hai
 Earlier, he had similarly destroyed the credibility of the Central Vigilance Commission (requiring the advice of a former Supreme Court judge)
 modi ab aise pehle pradhanmantri ban gaye hai jinke avaidh adeshon ko sheersh court ne radd kar diya he
 Governments came and governments went, but the autonomy of our constitutional institutions has always been maintained
 aaj kaa supreme court kaa nirnay modi sarkaar ke liye sabaq bhi he or sikh bhi!modi ji,aapke napak iraade dhwast ho jane ke baad,ab aap desh se saarvajanik rup se maafi maange !pic

 Surjewala tweeted, this is a lesson for you about our democracy and the strength of the Constitution
 isse pataa chalata he ki aap kitne bhi swechhachari hon, ant main kanoon aapako pakad hi letaa he
 Surjewala called the Prime Minister a 'crush of democratic institutions'
 congress netaa mallikarjun khadge ne bhi adaalat ke faisle kaa swaagat kiya
 He told reporters outside Parliament that today you will use these agencies to pressure people, tomorrow someone else will do it
 aise main loktantr kaa kya hoga? vahiin makapa mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne kaha ki adaalat ke faisle se sabit hota he ki pradhanmantri or unki sarkaar is maamle main sidhe taur par shaamil the
 Speaking to journalists outside Parliament, Rashtriya Janata Dal (rajedi) MP Manoj Jha called the decision a slap in the face of the government
 vahiin dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki yah aadesh is maamle main pradhanmantri modi ko sidhe doshi tehraata he
 The Aam Aadmi Party chief wrote on Twitter, the Supreme Court's reinstatement of the CBI chief directly blames the Prime Minister
 modi sarkaar ne desh ke sansthaanon or loktantr ko tabah kar diya
 Wasn't the removal of the CBI director midnight illegally an attempt to stop the investigation into the Rafale scam, which is directly linked to the prime minister? People's Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti has also welcomed the Supreme Court verdict
 unhone kaha ki centre sarkaar apane siyaasi phaayde ke liye sibiai or enie jaisi jaanch agenciyon kaa durupyog band kar dena chahie
 Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan said the order was an incomplete victory for CBI Chief Verma
 unhone kaha, unhen behaal to kar diya gaya he lekin unhen koi bhi nitigat faisla lene se roak diya gaya he
 Significantly, in its order, the court said that any decision regarding Alok Verma will be taken by the High Powered Committee to elect and appoint CBI Director

 But is this possible in this era of social media? Recently Bollywood celebrities gave their reactions to the surgical strike conducted by the Indian Army
 isamen bollywood kii sadabahaar gayikaasha bhoslene bhi jai hind likhaa
 See tweet -JAI HIND! - ashabhosle (@ashabhosle) September 29, 2016 But he had to write so much that his official Twitter account was like 'india Pakistan Ki Jang'
 iske jawaab main unke liye bhadde riplai die gaye
 You should definitely read what Asha Taine wrote after getting upset with them -didn't know so many abusive kutte were following me 😃deleted all
 Doodh ka doodh pani ka pani Guess my fellow artistes facing same problem— ashabhosle (@ashabhosle)september 30, 2016lekin is par bhi logon ne unako nahin bakhsha
 So he tweeted this about Pakistan and the people of Pakistan- Didn't know so many abusive kutte were following me 😃deleted all

 Best to ignore hate mail 😄😅😂— ashabhosle (@ashabhosle) September 30, 2016 Salman Khan said - pak's actors are not terrorists, bring permission
 
 
 or phir durban main apane concert kii ghoshnaa kar apane kaam main vyast ho gayi-looking forward to meeting my South African friends at tomorrow's concert in Durban
 As — ashabhosle (@ashabhosle) September 30, 2016 But it left a question about how reasonable it is to do this with artists and what they get! congress kii mahasachiv priyanka gandhi buudhvaar ko apni ganga yatra ke aakhri padaav par varanasi pahunchane vaali hai
 She wants to give a big message by meeting people living on the banks of the Ganges in the area with 5 Lok Sabha seats
 varanasi pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa kshetra he, aise main kaaryakartaaon ko yah bataanaa jaruri he ki party kisi seat ko halke main nahin rahi he
 Priyanka Gandhi has met thousands of people in these 3 days
 lekin raajnneetik jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki varanasi main congress kii raah itani aasaan nahin he
 The situation is such that there are Congress leaders here but the cadre is not strong
 cader ko majboot karne ke saath hi priyanka gandhi ko kai or chunautiyon se jujhna hoga
 The Congress is the oldest party and there was a time when Congress mps from Varanasi were elected, but the party was successful only in 2004 after the Janata Dal ousted the Congress in 1989 when Rajesh Mishra was elected MP from the Congress
 agar priyanka gandhi kii ganga yatra ko dekhen to isamen bhi kaaryakartaaon kaa abhaav sa dikhataa he
 On Tuesday, when Priyanka Gandhi reached the temple of mother Vindhyavasini, the slogans of every Modi reached there
 agar kaaryakartaaon kii majboot team hoti to aisa hona mushkil tha
 The 2009 election also saw a huge crowd at Sonia and Priyanka's rally, but that crowd did not turn into votes and the Congress candidate had to face defeat
 agar loksabhaa kii baat karen to mandir andolan ke baad keval ek baar 2004 main congress pratyaashee rajesh mishra ko yahaan se vijay mili
 Earlier in 1991,1996,1998, 1999 BJP candidates continued to win from here
 bijepi ke shankar prasad jaiswal yahaan se 3 baar saansad rahe
 In 2009, bjp's Murali Manohar Joshi was elected as an MP
 2014 ke chunaav main to narendra modi ne saare sameekaran badal die or prachand voton se yahaan se saansad chune gaye
 Ajay Rai of Congress finished third
 2009 ke mukaable congress ko kam vot mili
 Aam Aadmi Party convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal finished second from here
 unhen 2 lakh se zyada vot mili the jabaki congress pratyaashee ajay raay ko kareeb 75000
 If we talk about Vidhan Sabha, Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency has 5 Vidhan Sabha, Rohanian, Varanasi North, Varanasi South Varanasi Cantt and Sevapuri
 lekin kisi bhi seat par philhal congress kaa vidhayak nahin he
 The BJP won from Rohania in the 2017 election while the Congress got only 3207 votes in the 2014 assembly by-election
 isi tarah varanasi north main congress haashie par rahi
 In Varanasi South, the Congress was in a fight where Congress candidate Rajesh Mishra finished second after BJP
 varanasi kaint main bhi congress duusare number par rahi lekin jeet kaa kareeb 6 xxrep 4 0 rahaa
 The MLA from Apna Dal (sone Lal) won from Sevapuri
 congress kaa yahaan haashie par rahi
 In such a situation, the biggest challenge is to strengthen the workers in Varanasi
 agar party vaaki main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf yahaan se ladanaa chaahati he to use pehle hi pratyaashee ke naam kii ghoshnaa kerani hogi jisase kaaryakartaaon main koi bhram na rahe
 Political experts believe that during this visit, Priyanka will also have to announce whether the Congress candidate will contest against Narendra Modi or the SP-BSP candidate will be supported
 grass root par kaam karke hi sanghathan taiyaar hoga jo congress ko jagah dilaane main kaamyaab ho saktaa he
 Congress tried to hold its own in Varanasi even before this
 modi sarkaar ke do saal puure hone par congress netaa digvijay singh vahaan pahunche the jisamen unhone centre sarkaar kii naakaamiyaan ginai thim
 Rahul Gandhi has also gone to the farmers conference held in Varanasi
 lekin jis varanasi ko aresas kaa garh mana jaataa ho, jahaan se bijepi lagaataar jeet hasil kar rahe hon, vahaan par party ko majboot karne ke liye cader ko or majboot karnaa hoga
 America saw another major catastrophe in 'gun culture'
 duniya ke sabase taqatvar desh main andhadhundh firing kii khabaren lagaataar aati rahati hai
 Many innocent people are losing their lives in such firing

 After this incident there is a wave of mourning throughout the country
 in ghayalon main ek bhartiya america chaatr bhi shaamil he
 It is believed to be one of the deadliest firing incidents in US history
 skool main badi sankhya main bhartiya america samudaay ke chaatr padhate hai or inamen se kam se kam ek chaatr is golibari main maamuli rup se ghayal hua he
 The student studying in class ninth is undergoing treatment in the hospital
 duusari ore, haalanki america sansad ke spikar paul reyaan america nagarikon se bandook rakhane ke adhikaar ko khatm kiye jane kii baat se inkaar kiya he
 He says that even after such incidents, he does not think that the country should be strict about keeping guns
 vahiin america raashtrapati donald trump ne raashtra ke naam sambodhan main is golibari par dukh vyakt kiya or hataahaton ke pariwaron ke liye prarthana kii tathaa samvednaaen vyakt kin
 He said that we are with the families of those killed
 haadase ke shikaar logon ke parijanon se vah milane jaaenge
 In times of tragedy, the bonds that sustain us are those of family, faith, community, and country
 These bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil - and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need

 The Delhi Commission for Women has issued a notice to the Deputy Commissioner of Police, New Delhi, asking why an FIR was not registered against Sardar Singh, captain of India's hockey team, despite a complaint in an alleged sexual harassment case eight days ago? disidablyoo ne yah bhi poocha ki aaropee ke saath shaareerik sambandhon ke bare main ek mahila adhikari ke bajaae ek purush asi ne shikayatakarta se poochtacha kyon kii or use kareeb aadhi raat tak police thane main kyon roka gaya? ayog ne is maamle main 15 june ko praathmiki darj karne kii sifarish kii thi
 "the commission has been informed that no FIR has been lodged so far despite the complaint being lodged at the Chanakyapuri police station," the notice said
 ' isamen kaha gaya he, 'ayog ise gambhirtha se letaa he, kyonki yah ucchtam nyaayalay ke aadesh kaa ulanghan he, jisamen yah kaha he ki yadi soochna kisi sangyeya aparaadh ke bare main khulaasa karti he to praathmiki darj karnaa siarpisi kii dhara 154 ke tahat aavashyak he or aisi sthiti main praathmik jaanch aavashyak nahin he
 The Commission received a representation on 22 June in connection with some 'violations' in the protocol by the Delhi Police, according to which the complainant was questioned by a male ACP about a physical relationship with the accused rather than a female officer
 shikayatakarta ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki use 16 june ko raat nau baje police thane bulaayaa gaya or police thane main kareeb aadhi raat tak roke rakhaa gaya
 The woman officer contacted the complainant on June 20, seven days after receiving the complaint
 ayog ne disipi se notice milane ke 48 ghanton ke bheetar jawaab dene ko kaha he

 notice main kaha gaya he, 'ayog ko suchit kiya gaya he ki chanakyapuri police thane main shikaayat darj karaae jane ke baavjood ab tak koi praathmiki darj nahin kii gai he
 'it states,' the Commission takes it seriously, as it is a violation of the order of the Supreme Court, stating that if the information discloses about a cognizable offense then lodging an FIR under section 154 of crpc Is necessary and in such a situation primary investigation is not necessary

 The highlight of this victory is that this is Australia's first win against South Africa in Melbourne
 is maidan par in donon tiimon ke bich yah saatvaan vanade tha, isse pehle khele gaye sabhi vanade dakshin africa ke naam rahe hai
 The man of the match, 'man of the Match' Smith, presented a batting pattern in the second match in a row under odd conditions
 smith ne abhi pakistan ke khilaaf pichley maheene hi apana pehla shatak jamaaya tha or tab se lagaataar behtareen pradarshan kar rahe hai
 In the last match too, he scored 73 not out from just 55 balls and played an important role in bringing the team score to 329
 smith ne wicketiper ballebaaj mathew vade (52) ke saath chathe wicket ke liye 121 ran kii saajhedaari karke team ko sankat se ubaara
 James Faulkner later hit a stormy innings of 34 off 19 balls, which helped Australia to 268 for seven with one over remaining
 isse pehle dakshin africa ne pehle ballebaaji karte hue aath wicket par 267 ran banaaye the
 Captain AB de Villiers scored 91 runs for him
 unke alaava david miller (45) hi kuch upyogi yogadan de paye
 At one time it seemed extremely difficult for Australia to achieve the target
 pichley match main shatak jadne vaale aaron finch (22), unke saath pari kaa aagaaj karne vaale david warner (chaar), alrounder shen watasan (19), captain george beli (16) or glen maxwell (do) main se koi bhi del sten (47 ran dekar do wicket) kii aguwai vaale dakshin africa akraman kaa saamana nahin kar paaya
 But Smith batted with full commitment
 divilliars ne unhen pichley match main khatarnaak ballebaaj qaraar diya tha or daayen haath ke is ballebaaj ne vastav main ise sabit kiya
 He was dismissed when the team equalized the South African score
 smith ne apni 104 ranon kii pari main 112 gend kheli tathaa saat chauke lagaaye
 South Africa had given the target of 268 in the fourth ODI against Australia, after winning the toss and batting first, the South African team scored 267 for eight with the help of 91 runs by captain AB de Villiers
 divilliars ne 88 gend kii apni pari main chah chauke lagaaye
 After his dismissal in the 43rd over, the South African team could manage just 37 runs in the last seven overs
 apane 19wein vanade shatak kii ore badhate dikh rahe divilliars ko tej gendbaaj pat kamins ne steve smith ke haathon lapakvaaya
 Since then, Cummins, Mitchell Starc and James Faulkner have not allowed the South African batsmen to play openly
 david miller ne 61 gend main teen chaukon kii madad se 45 ran banaaye jabaki phalf du plasis ne 37 gend main 28 ran banaaye
 Cummins and Faulkner took two wickets each for Australia

 raashtrapati ne kaha, ‘jhuthe vaayadon kii parinti mohabhang main hoti he, jisase krodh bhadakta he tathaa is krodh kaa ek hi swaabhaavik nishaanaa hota he- sattadhari varg
 'he said that this anger would be calmed only when governments give the results for which they were elected

 Mukherjee warned that the ambitious Indian youth would not forgive his future betrayal
 jo log satta main hai, unhen apane or logon ke bich bharose main kami ko dur karnaa hoga
 Those who are in politics should understand that with every election there is a warning attached to it: 'give the result or get out'

 unhone kaha ki is baat kaa aakrosh he ki kya hamen rajya ke sabhi hisson tak samtapurna vikaas pahunchane ke liye chote-chote rajya banane chahie
 The debate is legitimate but it should conform to democratic norms

 Let us tell you that Upen Yadav was a member of the BJP during the 2013 assembly elections and played an important role in connecting the youth with Vasundhara

 Top leadership's failure to curb anti-incumbency, Magarur local leaders, two-four parties and its disgruntled activists from the upper-caste anger during last year's Dalit protests, all of which concern party president Amit Shah There are reasons for which he is credited with leading the party's victory in both national and state level elections
 alabatta haal kii chunavi haaron ko jhatak dene vaale shah loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle kaaryakartaaon main josh foonkane ke liye khud apni or pradhanmantri narendra modi kii jodi kii bhaashan kala par bharosa karnaa chahenge
 In the last four-and-a-half years, as BJP President, Shah has traveled nearly seven lakh kilometers and met party workers and supporters in 450 of the 700 districts of the country
 'desh kaa mizaaj' surveykshan ke mutabik pradhanmantri ke pad ke liye modi ke baad duusari sabase lokapriy pasand shah hi hai
 The number of BJP workers led by Shah is reportedly said to have increased to 11 crores
 aaj bhaajapa kii 400 jila ikaayiyon ke paas yaa to apana daftar he yaa daftar banane ke liye jameen he, jabaki 2016 main aisi ikaayiyon kii taadaad mahaj 160 thi
 Party workers believe that Shah has worked harder than any other president before him
 haalanki is chunaav main party ke liye itnaa hi kaaphi nahin ho saktaa
 Is the modi-shah duo still unbeatable or their aura is fading? Shah's second term came to an end, but he has not yet been able to form a full team of his office bearers
 party ke sheersh yaa bich ke str par gairtajurbekaar yaa kamjor netritv par bharosa karne kaa nateeja yah hua he ki jamini str se sahi or paryaapt feedback nahin aa rahaa he
 Shah's decisions are having an impact on this
 ahm baat yah he ki shah ne alokapriy ho chuke party ke nirvaachit netaaon ke khilaaf sakhti dikhaane se parhez kiya he
 For example, one reason for the defeat in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan was that Shah could not persuade the state leadership to replace at least 50 per cent of the mlas facing anti-incumbency statements in their constituencies
 party ko isaki keemat chukaani padi
 If the Shah had the same attitude during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the party may have to pay a heavy price once again as a large number of sitting mps are facing anti-incumbency
 party kaaryakartaaon kii niraashaa or maayusi shah ke saamne ek badi samasya he
 Government positions are lying vacant on a large scale because the Modi government has not been able to recruit them yet
 kuch maamalon main bhaajapa-aresas se itar logon ko ahm padon par baitha diya gaya he
 The Modi government has given a disproportionate share of power with party workers and has had a dismal impact on the morale of ordinary BJP workers
 ve shikaayat kar rahe hai ki congress jab bhi satta main ai, usne party ke sadasyon ko siyaasi ohadon se navajna pakkaa kiya
 Says a senior BJP leader, "by filling the vacant posts as quickly as possible, the sense of alienation among the workers will have to end and they have to give some kind of assurance that they are being taken care of
" ''bhaajapa ne rashtriya str par un tamaam party prakoshthon ko hataa diya he jo pichley saal tak maujuud the or party kaaryakartaaon main algaav kii bhaavana ko badha rahe the
 The second challenge for Shah is the party's stand on the Ram temple issue, which is different from the feeling of the average party worker that the BJP should enact a law immediately and start building the temple
 bhaajapa 2014 ke chunaav main madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh kii vijeta ke taur par gai thi or congress dilli kaa chunaav haar chuki thi; is baar vidhansabha chunaavon kii paraajay bhaajapa ke liye abhi taaja hi he
 The BSP-SP alliance in the state of Uttar Pradesh, which gave 71 Lok Sabha mps to the BJP in 2014, may give it a tough challenge
 so abaki baar, maamla 2014 jaisaa nahin he

 The BJP has reached the level of mapping of booths in terms of preparations for the assembly elections, on the other hand the Grand Alliance parties are denying the leadership of Hemant Soren
 kuch partiyaan to chunaav apane dam par sabhi siton par ladgaye kii taiyaari main jute gai hai
 In fact, in the last Lok Sabha elections, the Congress had led the Grand Alliance, at the last time the seats were divided in Delhi and it was decided to make Hemant Soren the leader of the Grand Alliance in the Assembly elections
 tab se jhamumo yah maanakar chal rahaa tha ki bhavi mahagathbandhan ke netaa hemanth sorain hi honge lekin congress ke nae pradesh adhyaksh rameshwar uraanv ne sorain ke netritv ke daawey ko sire se khaarij kar diya he
 In Giridih, Rameshwar Oraon clearly said, "the leader of the grand alliance has not been announced yet
" mahagathbandhan ke swaroop par abhi baatcheet baaki he
 There is a dispute over seat sharing
 '' par pradesh ke kaaryakari adhyaksh irfan ansaari hemanth sorain ke netritv kii baat maanate hai
 He says, "then it was said that the election would be contested under the leadership of Hemant Soren
 agar ham alag-alag lade to voton kaa bantwaaraa nahin rukegaa or phayda bhaajapa ko hoga
 On the other hand, the JMM has quoted a letter from Rahul Gandhi's tenure saying that the issue of leadership was decided in the Lok Sabha elections itself
 congress ke jharkhand prabharee arpyen singh bhi kehete hai, ''mahagathbandhan ko lekar koi bhi baat abhi kahana jaldbaaji hogi
 Negotiations for the agreement are underway afresh
 hemanth sorain hi netaa honge aisa abhi se tay nahin he
 In such a situation, JMM has started its preparations
 sorain maahaul banane ke liye sabhi 24 jilon main badlaav yatra par nikal pade hai
 Though he gives a firm reply on the delay in the alliance, "only after this journey is over will we be able to say anything on it
" agar bhaajapa kii raghubar sarkaar ko hataane ke liye meri bali deni hogi, to ham iske liye bhi taiyaar hai
 Soren's Parivartan Yatra started from Santhal Pargana and Kolhan areas is an attempt to retain the party's vote bank
 sutara bataate hai ki jhamumo chunaav main sabhi 81 siton par aajamaaish ke mood main he
 On the other hand, the Congress is also seen to be altering the organization and making five working presidents
 ansaari kehete hai, ''jhamumo ke saath gathjod hamaari majaburi he
 "former Chief Minister Babulal Marandi's party Jhavimo is also not in a hurry on the grand alliance
 marandi ne daawa kiya ki unki party bhi sabhi siton par chunaav kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 But Marandi is also growing up with Congress
 is baar rashtriya janata dal (rajd) loksabhaa chunaav kii bhul nahin doharaana chahta
 The RJD then withdrew from the Grand Alliance and fielded its candidate from Chatra
 par mahagathbandhan main shaamil hone kii ichha jataate hue bhi 30 agast ko ranchi main tejasvi yadav ne janaadhar ke hisaab se siton ke bantwaare kaa pech fansaa diya
 RJD is contesting 10 to 12 seats
 10 july ko jab jhamumo ne vipakshi dalon kii baithak main 41 siton par apni daavedaari pesh kii to baaki vipakshi dalon ke liye bachiin 40 siten
 This includes the Congress, JVM, RJD and Left parties
 congress kii najar 20 se 25 siton par he
 At the same time, jvm's claim is for at least 15 seats
 haal yah he ki jharkhand main vidhansabha kii utani siten hi nahin hai, jitne par mahagathbandhan ke dalon kaa daawa he
 On the other hand, the BJP has not only set a target of winning more than 65 seats for itself but has also given the slogan 'har ghar, Raghubar' by declaring Chief Minister Raghubar Das as the CM candidate
 charchaa he ki bhaajapa, vipakshi dalon ke kuch vidhayakon ko apane paale main laane kii jugat main he or isamen sukhdev bhagat jaise congressi chehre ke saath jhamumo ke log bhi hai
 The issue of possible breakdown is also a matter of concern for the opposition parties
 taqatvar or aakraamak ho rahi bhaajapa se mukaable ke liye unako ek hona padegaa or yah badi chunauti he

 This opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) is enjoying a lot, while the Janata Dal United (JDU) led by the state government has become uncomfortable
 jediu ne giriraaj ko twitor kii siyasat chhodane kii salaah di he
 In Begusarai, the JDU did not like to question the law and order of the local mps for uncontrollable crime
 jadyu ke pravaktaa rajeev ranjan ne is par pratikriya vyakt karte hue kaha ki giriraaj baar-baar kisi na kisi bahaane gathbandhan dharm ko lekar pehle bhi aarope lagaate rahe hai
 There is no honesty on their part in the discharge of coalition religion

 Identifying Giriraj such statement, the JDU spokesperson said that if there is so much concern about these questions, then they should seek the help of the administration, not follow Twitter
 unhone kaha ki aise bayaan giriraaj singh kii pahchaan ban gaye hai
 The state government is familiar with its responsibility
 in ghatnaon ke liye jimmedaar logon kii giraftaar or puri tatparta se aarope patr daayar karne ke nirdesh jari kiye ja chuke hai
 Rajiv Ranjan said that in such cases, nothing will be tolerated
 bayanon se jo bhi raajnneeti karnaa chaahate hai, unki party ke netaaon ko bhi samaj aa rahaa he
 He said that instead of making such statements, it would be better if you talk in the party forum

 lakhanu main mulaayam singh or akhilesh yadav ke ghar agal bagal hai
 There is no wall between the two houses but in the relationship such a big wall has been erected between them that the family quarrel is now being fought in the Election Commission
 mulaayam singh yadav kuch bhi daawa karen, ye baat dhire-dhire saaf hoti ja rahi he ki samaajawaadee party main sulah kii gunjaaish ab lagbhag khatm ho gai he
 Both Akhilesh and Mulayam factions submitted their documents to the Election Commission on Monday to vindicate their claims
 mulaayam somvaar kii shaam ko hi dilli laut aae aurshivpal yavadafilhal dilli main hi hai
 It is believed that within a day or two, Akhilesh will go to Delhi to meet Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi and after that, the alliance with Congress and Rashtriya Lok Dal can be finalized
 sutron ke mutabik congress ko 88 seat dene ke bare main mote taur par sahmati ban bhi chuki he
 The intention of Akhilesh Yadav's alliance with the Congress was made clear at the same time that he did not declare candidates on the seats in his list where the Congress has sitting mlas
 iske alaava sonia or rahul ke chunaav kshetra raibareli or amethi main bhi ek ko chhodkar baaki sabhi siten khaali chodi gai thim
 The most upset among the alliance with the Congress is the candidates whom both Akhilesh and Mulayam want to give tickets
 donon taraf se jari kii gai list ke mutabik aise 167 ummidavaar hai jinka naam donon hi liston main he
 Mulayam Singh has declared a list of 397 candidates, while Akhilesh Yadav has announced 235 candidates
 aise tamaam ummidavaar ye soch kar maayoos hai ki baap bete ke jhagade main unka kaam tamaam ho jayega
 He now has to decide whether he wants to join Akhilesh's camp or stick with Mulayam Singh
 zyaadaatar aise ummidavaar philhal khulkar kuch bhi bolne se inkaar kar rahe hai kyonki unhen bhi is baat kaa intjaar he ki cycle chunaav chinh kiske paas jaataa he
 Most of the candidates believe that it will be very difficult to win the election with the new election symbol

 balaatkaar se peedit mahilaayein jinda laash nahin hotin
 To say this is a backward social notion that promotes the body of a woman as the essence of femininity and declares rape as death
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki ham kisi bhi tarah ek aise aparaadh kii barbar prakruti kaa sarleekaran kar rahe hon jo ek stri deh kii swaittata ko bhang karata he or usamen itani hinsak send lagaataa he jitna or kuch bhi nahin ho saktaa
 But the rape victim remains alive, lives her life and lives normally, provided her society gets her justice soon, punishes her criminals harshly and gives her a chance to rebuild her life
 safadarajang aspataal main maut se jang ladati us yuvati (jise ab ilaaj ke liye singapore bhej diya gaya he) ne apni maa ko kathith taur par yahi to likhaa tha, ‘‘main jeena chaahati hum

" yah dukhadaayak sachaai he ki rajdhani main mahilaon kii suraksha ke liye dilli police ko die gaye disha-nirdeshon kaa yadi paalan kiya gaya hota, masalan kaale shishe lagane vaali bason ke maalikon ko dandit kiya gaya hota, to aisa jaghanya aparaadh nahin ho saktaa tha
 It was a very minor step, but only because of it not being taken, a young woman is fighting death due to fatal wounds
 is disha-nirdesh kaa ulanghan karne vaale sheersh police afasaron ko kya dandit nahin kiya janaa chahie? lekin ab tak koi karrwai nahin hui he
 The courageous girl is still fighting for life and death, while the whole country and especially the city where she came in search of employment, has been boiling over the violence against her

 Everyday thousands of women have to undergo sexual harassment at different levels in buses, on roads and in the metro
 kaamkaaji mahilaayein khaskar nishaanaa banaai jaati hai
 All this has been going on for so many days, despite this a conspiracy of silence has been continuously created while the most heinous crimes continue to be against women and children
 aaj jo naare ham sun rahe hai, ve chuppi ke tuutane kaa sanket hai
 That is why we should openly welcome this public uplift, even if it contains lustful elements that are included by drinking some alcohol to spoil the atmosphere
 dilli kii sadakon par peedit ladki ke liye insaaf kii maang kar rahe hajaaron noujvaan shaayad in pradarshnon ke madhyam se samvedansheel ban saken or mahilaon ko vastu kii tarah dekhne kii bajaae barabari kaa darja de saken

 After all, it is only men who commit violence against women

 However, after this, boys and youth have to be educated in a very systematic way against the inherited male dominance and the notion of discrimination against girls
 desh ke kuch hisson main aitihaasik rup se saamaajik sudhaar ke majboot andolanon ke nahin hone ke chalate mahilaon ke prati purushon ke ravaie main aakraamakata or nafrat kaa bhav he
 Such attitude is found especially in the case of young girls when people say that women are crossing the Lakshman Rekha to be a good daughter, mother, sister and wife
 jab koi mahila apni jaruraton or aakankshaon kii vajah se ek swatantra naagarik ke taur par apni asmita ko abhivyakt karti he, to uske khilaaf hinsa ko or vyapak saamaajik sweekruti mil jaati he
 Any expression of women's sexuality should be punished, whether it is a case of interracial / inter-communal companionship of their own free will, or a reaction given to a woman's dress, speech or movement
 maujuuda maamle main aparaadhiyon ne peedita or uske mitra par yahi yahi fikaraa ksaa tha ki ve itani raat gaye baahar kya kar rahe hai
 In the culture of the so-called modernization of the Indian economy and the market-based consumerism that came with it, the objectification of the female body through bipartisan advertisements easily matches with the anti-female patriarchy we have here
 iskaa asar itnaa tagada he ki yah bharat ke har hisse main fail chukaa he, yahaan tak ki un jagahon par bhi jahaan auraton ne saarvajanik jivan main kahin zyada swatantra bhoomika nibhaai he
 Even now, there is not much attention that the aggressive culture of the market is giving rise to the kind of bestial feelings in the social life lost against the female body, and the culture of resistance is inadequate
 pradarshnon se mahilaon ko milegaa sawaal poochne kaa saahasis pradarshan kaa sabase chankane vaala ahm pahalu noujvaan ladakiyon kii isamen sakriy or swataru sfoort bhagidaari he
 The courage of a girl victim of vandalism has touched the hearts of the women of this country
 in sabhi ko saarvajanik sthalon par jo apmaan sahanaa padataa he, vahi inhen ekasutra main pirota he
 This could have happened to any of them
 ladkiyaan jo naare laga rahi thim or jaise placord thame hue thim, ve swatantra naagarik ke taur par unki pahchaan ko jaahir karte hai jinke paas apni marji ke hisaab se kapade pahanane, bolne-chaalane or vyavhaar kaa adhikaar he
 The anger hidden within them seems to have finally found a platform
 jaahir taur par yah maujuuda ghatana se hi judaa he, lekin unhen isi bahaane ab anyaaypurna vyavastha ke khilaaf apni chunauti kii takat or uske naitik rup se jaij hone kaa ehsaas ho chalaa he
 Even on a personal level, the women who went to these demonstrations will definitely get the strength to question discriminatory behavior everywhere, including their home

 It would be futile to call a special session of Parliament if only inefficient and harmful laws were adopted in the name of draconian laws

 But to get women to justice, political will will be required under the leadership of the country

 Two days later, in Vijaypur area of sheopur district, the dacoits kidnapped Bunty, a young man who was irrigating the fields, in the presence of his father
 abhi kuch din pehle hi gwalior ke ghatigaanv ilaake se ek jadi-booti vikreta kaa apharan ho gaya tha
 Mishra, the abducted supervisor, came out after four days, but this incident confirmed the increasing mobilization of dacoits in the region

 But the reality is that the dacoits have rarely released anyone without a ransom in any case

 These are cattle-stealing dacoits, who nowadays have been ransomed
 police inhen turant pakadaney yaa inkaa khaatmaa karne ke paksh main he
 "DIG Gupta also adds his opinion to it," Pappu and Kalli Gurjar are not such big dacoits who can be listed as these people do not commit regular crimes nor are they organized gangs
 '' police dakaiton ko jaan-bujhkar soochibaddh nahin karti
 In this case, the reward is declared on the head of the main dacoit, but the police say about their gang members that they work temporarily
 dakaiton ko soochibaddh na karne se sarkaar ko bhi aparaadh kam dikhaane kaa mauka mil jaataa he
 Whatever the side of the police, the dacoits are engaged in increasing stature by taking advantage of not being listed

 As the police feel relief by killing the big dacoits, the small crooks stand up

 Therefore, it is necessary to constantly wipe out the small crooks along with the dacoits
 ''tasviir kaa ek pahalu yah he ki ilaake main girohon ke movement kii khabar vahaan ke thana prabharee se lekar adhinsthon ko hoti he, par unki koshish yahi rahati he ki chote badmaashon ko bada karo, phir maaro
 The reason? Premature promotion and greed for Madel

 Family members said that Shivangi had married a court named Vipin Sagar three months ago

 The family alleged that Vipin implicated Shivangi in his love trap and formed a physical relationship with her
 parijanon kii maane to vipin shivangi se shaadi nahin karnaa chahta tha lekin dabaav ke chalate usne shivangi se shaadi kii thi
 Shortly after marriage Vipin started fighting with Shivangi
 itnaa hi nahin, vipin shivangi ke sharir ko cigarette or maachis se bhi daagta tha
 At the same time, Vipin's family started demanding dowry from Shivangi
 har roj kii yaatnaaon se tang aakar kuch roj pehle shivangi apane maayke aa gai thi
 Seeing the situation worsening, Shivangi's father went to his in-laws but he was banished from there

 That was a big mistake on my part

 But i can say one thing that we were all with our captain

 The impasse over seven months has come to an end with Governor Devanand Kunwar appointing the regular vice-chancellor (VC) and pro-vice-chancellor in the six universities of the state
 lekin rajbhavan or bihar sarkaar ke bich paraspar vishwaas main lagaataar aa rahi kami kii samasya ab bhi barkaraar he, sambhawatah donon pakshon ke bich khai or gaharaa gai he

 Shahi has described them as "illegal"
 sanyog se, shahi, jo purv mahadhivaktaa bhi hai, is mudde par pehle bhi rajyapal kii aalochana karne se peeche nahin rahe hai
 Shahi criticized the Governor saying that prior to the appointments, the Raj Bhavan did not favor mandatory consultation with the state government
 rajya ke vishvavidhyalayon ke kuladhipati kunwar or nitish ke bich 17 july ko baithak hui thi
 It spoke on allegations that it was said that the Raj Bhavan is coming in the way of higher education
 bade str par mana ja rahaa he ki beshak mulaakaat ke dauraan kulapati kii niyuktiyon ko lekar charchaa hui thi, lekin mukhyamantri ne baithak ke dauraan kulapati pad ke liye kisi bhi naam par charchaa nahin kii thi
 Governor Kunwar, who has displayed his advocacy in the Guwahati High Court and the Supreme Court, seems to agree to a great extent that his two meetings with the Chief Minister regarding the appointment of Vice Chancellors fulfill the condition of consultation
 kaha ja rahaa he ki maanav sansaadhan vikaas ke bheje gaye naamon ke panel main se kisi bhi naam ko na chune jane se shahi naaraaz hai, vahiin vishvavidhyalay ke sutara tark de rahe hai ki niyam echaradi ko naam bhejne ke liye yogya nahin banaate hai
 The Governor's Secretariat believes that the government may suggest some names during the consultation process, but the Chancellor is not obliged to agree to those names

 The tenure of the Vice Chancellors of these universities ended in January this year
 kulapatiyon kii maujuuda niyuktiyaan is sandarbh main kaaphi mahatvapurn hai ki pichley saat maheene se kaaryvahak kulapati in vishvavidhyalayon ko chalaa rahe the kyonki rajya sarkaar or rajbhavan ke bich ek raay nahin ban paa rahi thi, jis kaaran se matbhed khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahe the
 Some Congress leaders also tried to give political color to this issue by raising their voice in favor of the Governor
 congress netaa ranjita ranjan kahati hai, ''rajyapal ke rajya ke vishvavidhyalayon ke paden kuladhipati hone ke kaaran kulapatiyon kii niyukti unka adhikaar hota he
 NDA leaders are trying to make it an issue
 rajg ke rajyapal ke pad ke mahatv ko kam karne ke prayaason ko congress katai bardaasht nahin karegi
 Earlier, JD (U) spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member Shivanand Tiwari met the Prime Minister on Tuesday and complained about Kunwar's continued efforts to appoint a vice-chancellor without consulting the state government
 udhar, yuva congress adhyaksh lalan kumaar ne bihar ke rajyapal ke sanvaidhanik adhikaar par sawaal uthaane kii rajg kii koshishon kii aalochana kii he
 This is not a new case of loss of confidence between the State Government and the Governor

 Senior BJP leader and former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha said that if the BJP government is formed at the Center, Robert Vadra's earnings will be investigated and if he is found guilty, legal action will be taken against him

 For two Lok Sabha seats, the media presents Priyanka's talk as if she is addressing a crowd of millions

 Sinha said that his entire family is leading a public life

 What remains in public life is commentary on both good and evil

 Sinha said that the Congress, which has run the government for ten years at the Center, has no issues and hence it is carrying out personal attacks
 jab bijepi ne iskaa jawaab dena shuru kiya to ab chubhan ho rahi he

 com / 4notvhdl3o tha zuk pehle dilli main punjab kaa sa husnapper ab voh pani kehete hai multan bah gayazok ko kya pataa tha ki jis dilli ke suurate haal par unki aah nikal rahi he, sadi kaa panna palatate palatate isi dilli kii khubsuurati or rasookh par log rashk karenge
 Delhi, which runs the country's rule, Delhi, which makes and destroys the fortunes, has become 100 years old for you and our Delhi
 nai dilli ko banaaya bhale hi angrejon ne lekin ise sanvaarane or kai baar bigaadane kaa bhi kaam ham hindustaniyon ne hi kiya
 At this hundredth stage of the age of Delhi, let's turn to see how Delhi became New Delhi
 baat 1910 kii he jab england ke nae raja jorge pancham kii tajposhi hui
 By then, the country had become a slave to the British rule
 kalakatta ke raste hindustan aane vaale angrez vahiin se desh kii satta chalaa rahe the
 The need for a new capital had been felt by the British for many years, but the decision to partition Bengal made this need a compulsion
 1905 main hue bengal ke batwaare kaa virodh itnaa bad chukaa tha ki angrejon ne rajdhani vahaan se sametane main hi hoshiyaari samajhi
 What could have been better for this than the coronation of the new king
 12 disambar 1911, yahi wo taarikh thi jab dilli main shahi darbar laga
 For the first time both the king and queen were present in this court
 sau saal pehle kii us darbar main british hukumat kii shaano shaukat kaa jalawaa har taraf bikharaa tha
 When the court was about to end, in a very dramatic way, the King of England himself stood up and declared that Delhi would now be the capital of India
 dilli darbar khatam hone ke teen din baad rajdhani kii neenv rakhi gayi
 The King and Queen laid the rock
 nayi rajdhani ke elaan ke baad kingsve camp ke paas ek asthaayee rajdhani banaai gayi
 Then began the exercise of acquiring land for the capital
 dilli us samay avibhajit punjab praant kaa hissaa thi
 About 1
25 lakh acres of land in 128 villages of Delhi and Vallabhgarh tehsils were taken to build New Delhi
 or dilli ke shilanyas ke sirf 9 din baad 21 disambar 1911 ko pachaas hazaar kisaanon or kaashtkaaron ko adhigrahan kaa notice thama diya gaya
 The village land acquired for the new capital included villages like Malcha, Raisina, Mangalapuri, Jaisingpura, Talkatora, Barakhamba
 angarez chaahate the ki unki dilli mughaliya dilli se bilkul alag dikhe
 For this, famous architect Edwin Lutyens and his partner Herbert Baker were called to Delhi in 1912
 lutian ne aate hi neenv kaa pathar daali gayi coronaton park kii zamin ko tang or malaria ke khatre se bhari bataate hue anfit qaraar de diya
 Then began the search for a new land which stopped at Raisina Hill
 kingsve camp par jorge pancham kaa lagaaya patthak raaton raat chaar mile dur lage is raisina hill par panhucha diya gaya
 This is in May 1913
 jahaan ye pathar rakhe gaye aage chal kar vahiin par ye north or south blaak bane
 The work of building the most magnificent buildings of the nation's capital has started around the barren and rocky hills of Raisina Hills
 maalcha gaanv ke peeche kii zamin patharilii thi, so vahaan pathar kii khadaan banaai gai or pathar dhone ke liye ek railway line bhi bichaai gayi
 And then Raisina Hills, where the noise of power and politics resonates today, there was a buzz of gunpowder a hundred years ago
 aaj jahaan sansad bhawan, raashtrapati bhawan, sarkari daftaron or mantriyon-saansadon ke bangale dikhaai padate hai, unhen taiyaar karne ke liye rysina hills ko dynamite se udaaya gaya
 New Delhi was being built
 or usamen sabase dilachasp or pechida kaam tha sansad bhawan kaa nirmaan
 Both the architects Lutyens and Baker got hooked on its craft and style
 sansad bhawan ke nirmaan kaa zimmaa baker ke paas tha jinhone iskaa aakaar kuch aisa tay kiya
 But Lutyens were adamant on making it circular and eventually Lutyens did
 1921 main sansad bhawan kaa shilanyas hua or paanch saal baad 80 lakh rupee kii laagat se ye taiyaar hua
 Baker's credit for the design of the North and South blocks, the country's bureaucratic stronghold, goes to Baker
 1930 main taiyaar hui in do imaarato ko duniya ke sabase bhavy sarkari daftaron main gina jaataa he
 When the Rashtrapati Bhavan with round dome was built, it was named Viceroy's House
 kyonki tab is mahal main vysarai rahete the
 The British government's biggest figure in India
 lutian kii dizin par ye rajmahal 17 saal main ban kar taiyaar hua
 But Lutyens' masterpiece was yet to come
 unhen dilli ko nai pahchaan deni thi, jiske liye lutian ke dimag main ubhara india get kaa nakshaa
 The Parliament House was built in just five years but it took a full ten years for India Gate to be built
 or iskaa shilanyas 1921 main usee duk of conot ne kiya tha, jinke naam par dilli ke pehle or sabase posh market kaa naam padaa conot place
 The city started settling, the seven seaside residents started coming, then they got the call of their favorite market from Connaught Place
 aaj aaleeshaan shorums or jagamag logon kii raunak se gulzaar rajeev chowk tab keekar ke jangalon se ghira gaanv tha- madhoganj gaav
 The work of Connaught Place began in 1920
 ghode kii naal ke aakaar main bana ye bazaar us vaqt europe ke bazaaron ko khubsuurati or shaano shaukat main puri takkar detaa tha
 Madhoganj's haunted forest ended in the glow of Connaught Place, but there was a fault at that time with Lutyen's Honor in making Delhi's heart, which has not been fixed till date
 us jamaane main bhi barsaat ke dinon main knot place kaa vahi haal ho jaataa tha jo aaj ek phuhaar padate hi ho jaataa he
 The same mud and the same dirty water on the streets
 lekin ek mjedaar baat or bhi he
 Although the appearance of Central Park was a little different then but still there is what happens today
 bas aaraam farmana or gappein ladaana
 After 20 years of preparation, Delhi has truly emerged as the capital of the country
 15 farvari 1931 ko aupchaarik taur par nayi dilli kaa udghaatan hua
 But no one knew then how another appearance of Delhi is going to emerge in the coming days
 angrejon ne desh par raaj karne ke liye dilli main deraa daal liya tha
 New Delhi was made for itself
 dilli kaa vartmaan chamak rahaa tha lekin bhavishya dhundhlaya hua tha
 To eliminate this blur, British warlords started showing them pictures of the future
 haalanki angrejon ne 1881 main hi saint stephens college bana diya or 1899 main hindu college banakar taiyaar ho gaya
 Ramjas College was also formed in 1917
 isliye angrej uniwarsity ke naam par anmane the
 But under pressure, Delhi University was formed in 1922 by combining all three colleges
 angrej shaayad uniwarsity ke liye kabhi taiyaar nahi hote
 But coming to New Delhi, he also had to show his generosity and got only 40 thousand rupees from the pocket of that show - for Delhi University
 angrej sahab bahaduron ne uniwarsity bana di to desi rhibahadur kya skool bhi nahin banavaa sakate the
 Perhaps that's why Lala Raghuveer Singh and Sir Shobha Singh opened a modern school in Delhi for the purpose of preparing new plants for the university
 1920 main khulaa ye skool 1932 tak badi shakl le chukaa tha
 The training of new age in New Delhi started here
 ek taraf gyaan kii badi-badi paathshaalaayein khuleen to duusari taraf dharm ke bade-bade mandir bhi banane lage
 At that time, the lock of castes used to hang on most temples
 tabhi nai dilli main ek aisa mandir bana, jahaan chuaachhut ke liye no entry kaa board taang diya gaya
 The country was also feeling the heat of Gandhi's charismatic personality amidst the threat of English rule
 gandhi kii soch ko puraa desh salaam kar rahaa tha
 He was creating an India that could be free from all forms of slavery
 aise hi ek mandir kii buniyaad rakhi gayi 1933 main
 In 1939, when the Laxminarayan temple of Birla was ready, Gandhiji inaugurated it only on the condition that people of every caste would be allowed to come here
 azaadi se pehle hi aazaadee ke siddhant dilli waalon kii soch badal rahe the
 But living in New Delhi's tradition was not changing the old Delhi tradition
 keekar ke jangalon ko saaf karke nai dilli to ban gayi lekin dilli kii jaan chandani chowk tab bhi apane dharre par chal rahi thi
 Wherever the prince of the Mughalia Sultanate came to visit Tafrih
 haweliyon ke jharokhon se dilli apane pados main basati hui nai dilli ko dekh rahi thi
 But his life was going on the old wheels of tradition
 nae daur ne chandani chowk main bhi glamer kii chandani bikher di, lekin puraani pahchaan aaj bhi kaayam he
 Whether it is a street with a paratha or a traditional way of business, it continues even today with slight changes
 gulaami ke daur main satta kaa pataakaa beshak angrej architect lutiuns kii basaai nai dilli main laharaata rahaa, lekin aaazaad bharat main tirange ko sabase badi salaami puraani dilli kii sabase badi pahchaan lalakile par hi milti he
 At midnight of 14–15 August 1947, while the world was sleeping, India was awakened by the gong of freedom
 us jaagran kaa alakh dilli main jagaa, jo tab tak mulk kaa mustakabil likhane laga tha
 New Delhi was 36 years old
 lekin us raat aazaadee kii khushiyon main nahaai nai dilli kaa janm hua
 Where the Europeans did not rule, the common Indian was dreaming of his new status in the new India
 nehru ke aitihaasik bhaashan ke saath dilli hi nahin desh kii takadir kaa bhi panna palata or azaad bharat ke nae adhyay kii shuruyaat hui
 As if on 15 August 1947, the entire Delhi Parliament House gathered
 yakeen karenge aap ki ye vahi sansad bhawan he jahaan aam aadmi to chhodiye, bagaiyr ijazat parinda bhi par nahi maar saktaa
 But then look at the scene - whether the Prime Minister and the common man - in freedom, every person stood shoulder to shoulder with the status of just one Indian
 nai dilli kii munder se nae hindustan kaa nakshaa dekhne kii dilchaspee or ankhon main khushiyon ke aansu liye
 But the joy of breaking the chains of slavery came with the wounds of the Partition of the country
 apana sab kuch lutaa kar aae lakhon sharnaarthiyon ke liye nai zindagi kii nai ummid nai dilli se hi thi
 On the basis of this expectation, Delhi started settling from a different end
 lajpatnagar, rajendranagar, nizamuddin, east punjabi baag, greater kailash, kingsve camp jaise ilaako main sharnaarthiyon ke liye nai bastiyaan basaai gayi
 It was the encouragement of these people and the generosity of Delhi that the then refugee camps are among the most posh areas of present-day Delhi
 50 or 60 ke dashak raashtra nirmaan ke dashak the
 There was a network of dams, roads and industries across the country, but in Delhi, there was a lot of fun and devotion in the pace of life
 hindustan kaa vistaar ho chukaa tha or ab dilli ko nibhaani thi nae hindustan kii har zarurat puri karne or vikaas kii nai raah dikhaane kii jimmedaari
 New Delhi had now moved on the new path towards the new destination
 shahar kii pahchaan banane vaale kai ahm santhaan zarur vajood main aae, jinamein sabase khaas tha 1956 main ban kar taiyaar hua ol india institute of medical sinsez yani ames, jiskaa aaj bhi desh main koi sani nahin to 1961 main indian institute of technology kaa dilli main campus kholane kaa 16 saal purana sapana bhi saakaar ho gaya
 JNU, started in 1969, made the people of Delhi aware of the international standard of education
 1962 main dilli hawaii adde ko us jagah par shift kar diya gaya jise aaj ham indira gandhi international airport ke terminal-thri yani tii 3 ke naam se jaanate hai
 The development of Delhi caught real momentum in the game when it was announced that Delhi will host the 1982 Asian Games
 vaise to 1951 main pehle asian games dilli main hi hue the lekin tab inke bare main koi jaanata nahin tha
 In the next 30 years, Asiad's credibility had grown significantly
 so 82 ke asian khel dilli kii saakh kaa sawaal bhi ban gaye
 The shame of Hindustan was now in the hands of Delhi, so the great process of polishing Delhi started
 angrejon ne vikaas ko sapaat sadakon par daudaya tha, lekin ab dilli kii tarakkee udaan bharne kii taiyaari main thi
 Delhi saw its first flyover in 1979–80 between Safdarjung and Defense Colony
 is oonchai se hi khel ke wo maidan bhi dikhne lage, jinase pataa ki hindustan ab naa sirf apane pairon par khadaa he balki duniya se kadamtal kar rahaa he
 Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium was built for the Asiad Games, while the sports village of Siri Fort was also ready to host Asian players
 sachmuch 1982 ke asian khelon ne dilli kii to sirf surat badali lekin south dilli kii takadir bhi badal gai
 After the Asiad, the areas of South Delhi which could not be settled even by the British, living in the same South Delhi became a status symbol
 rysina hills se shuru hua nai dilli kaa safar ab dilli kii sarhad main samaa nahin rahaa tha
 Delhi had become the capital of hearts along with the country
 1926 main nai dilli ko desh ke rail network se jodne ke liye nai dilli railway stesan shuru ho chukaa tha or azaadi ke baad desh ke kisi shahar se dilli dur nahin rah gai thi
 When the railroad of people started in Delhi, it was realized that the heart of Delhi is as large, its borders are as tight
 tab yaad aayaa 1962 main dilli ke pehle master plan main diya gaya en si aar banane kaa prastaav
 Nearly two decades after the plan was enacted, Parliament finally passed the bill and enacted the National Capital Region in 1985
 ab dilli ko koi phikr nahin thi
 There was no land for expansion, nor was the sky to fly
 dilli ne apni seemaa se sate upi ke noida or gajiabad or haryana ke gudgaanv, sonipat or faridabad ko baanhe failaakar apana liya
 a poet has said that who will love him, who will cross the Jamuna
 jamuna paar ke log bhi shaayad yahi sochate the ki dilli ab bhi unase dur he
 But the changing times made many areas of Jamunapar stand in posh areas of Delhi
 mazdooron or majaburon kii bastiyon ke bich nai dilli kaa glamer ab greater dilli tak pahunchane laga tha
 Mother Dairy, which started in 1974 in the same Yamuna crossing, became a destination without which the Delhi morning was incomplete
 nai dilli main shwet kranti ke das baras biit chuke the
 For the first time in Delhi, which always attracts everyone from the heart without any discrimination, provoking hatred
 31 oktober 1984 yahi wo taarikh thi, jab dilli manahoosiyat main dub gai
 Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was gunned down by her own security personnel
 is ghatana ne dilli kii soch badal di
 Always thinking of progress, Delhi first started thinking of revenge, which had a terrible riot
 gunaah chand siraphiron kaa tha, jisaki sazaa puri kaum ko dene kii sanak savaar ho gai
 Delhi also took that pain on his chest
 dangon kii aag buji to ek baar phir nai dilli nikal padi nae safar par, takanic ke pankh lagaakar duniya ko nae bharat se rubaru karaane kii udaan bharne kaa daur inhen dangon ke baad shuru hua
 After Indira Gandhi, the command of the country was in the hands of the young Rajiv Gandhi
 dilli kii buniyaad majboot ho chuki thi, zarurat thi raftaar kii
 Till now, Delhi became the capital of communication revolution of the country, in 1986, through trunk call and telegram
 mahanagar telephone limited yani emtnael kii shuruyaat choti si thi, sirf dilli or mumbai ke liye shuru hui is telephone seva ne puure desh ko aapas main judane kaa sidhaa, aasaan or behad speed vaala rasta dikhaa diya
 In the 1980s, Delhi realized that the time was going to change rapidly
 iske liye hindustan ko bhi badalanaa padegaa or hindustan ko rasta dikhaane kii jimmedaari dilli ko hi nibhaani hogi
 With this thought, a small car was brought to Delhi
 1980 main japan ke sahyog se gudgaanv main maaruti car company kii buniyaad padi
 In 1984, the first batch of small but affordable Maruti cars hit the streets and Delhi ran at full speed
 baiylgaadee or taange se shuru hua dilli kaa safar tab tak suhana tha, jab tak tram kaa jamaana tha
 After independence, the pace of New Delhi increased, but the progress was now charging its price from Delhi
 angrejon ke jamaane main sahab bahaduron kii buggy or motorcar kii jagah daudti-bhaagti gadiyon ke dhuen main dilli kaa dam ghutane laga
 When the buses started running for the common people in Delhi in the name of Delhi Transport Service in 1948, Delhi people were happy
 1958 main sansad ne ise dilli transport korporation main badal diya, lekin naam badalane se kya hota
 Diesel continued to burn in these buses and Delhi was engulfed by poisonous smoke
 pani naak tak aa gaya, to supreme court kii dakhal ke baad deazal vaali bason kii jagah sienji basen dilli kii dhadkan ban gayi
 Delhi breathed peace, but under the burden of the growing population, Delhi was still suffocating
 ditisi kaa boj ghataane ke liye local trainen to thim, lekin unka network behad kamazor tha
 And then the metro came to rejuvenate Delhi
 1995 main jab dilli metro rail korporation vajood main aayaa, tab dilli ne sochaa bhi nahin tha ki agle saat saal main metro rail uski life line ban jaaegi
 In 2002, Delhi boarded the metro rail for the first time
 dilli metro kaa ye pehla safar tha dilashaad garden se rithala ke bich jo kab nai dilli se puraani dilli or phir ensiaar kii jaan ban gai, ye pataa hi nahin chalaa
 Delhi had moved one step further towards becoming a world class city
 paanch sitara hotels to pehle se the, ab dilli main paanch sitara hospitals kaa daur shuru ho chukaa tha
 Hospitals of big industrial houses started opening in 1951 to compete with Sir Gangaram Hospital, which started as a charitable hospital
 dilli ab taiyaar thi duniya ko apni chamak-damak se dang karne ke liye
 By the end of the 20th century, Delhi used to find its identity in the British building
 lekin ikkisvin sadi main kadam rakhte hi dilli ne rakhi apni nai pahchaan kii neenv
 Akshardham on the banks of Yamuna
 akshardham se 21veen sadi ke dilli kii shuruyaat hui to uskaa aglaa padaav bana kaamanwealth games
 Sportspersons from 71 countries were coming to Delhi for the first time and Delhi started decorating itself to receive them
 1982 ke asiad khelon ke baad dilli kii chamak main koi chand-sitara nahin judaa tha
 Now there was a chance to compensate them all
 dilli main stadium to the lekin un tak pahunchane ke raste tang ho gayi the
 Hence, for the first time, a massive campaign was started to drive Delhi out of the traffic red net
 fliover or anderpas kaa jaal bich gaya
 The world saw a different New Delhi on 3 October 2010
 chamakati-damakati dilli
 But there was a big stain behind this fire
 dilli kaa safar is asamanjas ke saath jari he ki daag chhupaae yaa chamak-damak par itaraae
 Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Babulal Gaur, who has made headlines many times due to his controversial statements, has said that if he used Yadav surname in front of his name, BJP would not make him CM
 gaur 2004-05 main madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri rah chuke hai
 Speaking at a function on Sunday, he said, 'if i had written Yadav in my name, i would not have become Chief Minister'
 unhone yah baat banke bihari yadav samaaj samiti dwaara yojit ek samaaroh main kahi
 The leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party said that he is Yadav, but Yadav does not blossom
 yah unka top sikret he, jo aaj bataa rahe hai
 If Yadav had written, he would not have become the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh
 party shaayad chunaav main tikat tak nahin detii
 He said this when an officer expressed his desire to address him with the nickname Yadav in place of Gaur
 gaur ne aage kaha ki agar yadav samaaj ke log gita kaa gyaan le len to desh main raaj karenge
 Gaur Yadav had come to attend the community wedding program
 is maukey par vivaah yogya yuvak-yuvatiyon kaa parichay bhi hua
 People of the Yadav community of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar were also present at the ceremony
 khel ke maidan kaa purana dastur he
 When the team starts losing, the fingers start to lift at each other
 magar khel ke maidan kaa ye dastur pakistan main aatank ke maidan main bhi dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 Operation All Out of the Indian Army gave the runners out of Kashmir in such a way that their masters' plans were shattered
 bechaini to laazmi he
 But in this restlessness, two of Pakistan's biggest terrorists Hafiz Saeed and Syed Salahuddin have fought among themselves
 alam ye he ki donon ek duusare kii jaden kaatane main lag gaye hai
 The terrorists who were trying to enter the country from the outskirts, terrified by Operation All Out, were selectively killed by those who had been sheltering in Kashmir, and those who were trying to shake the valley
 oparation ol out ke tahat ab tak 230 se zyada aatankiyon ko maaraa ja chukaa he
 So, in the world of terror, the height of fury is now that the jihad contractors have clashed with each other
 kufia agency kii report se bada khulaassbar ye he ki aatanki sanghathan lashkar, hijbul or jaish main aapasi jang chhid gai he
 Due to this, conspiracy is being hatched to remove Salahuddin from the Jihad Council
 ajtak ko mili exclusive khufia report ke mutabik united jehad counsil ke chif ke pad ko lekar pakistan ke teen teen bade aatanki sanghathan aapas main bhid gaye hai
 In this tussle, Hafiz Saeed and Maulana Masood Azhar are trying to remove Syed Salahuddin of the Hizbul Mujahideen, sitting as the Chief of the United Jihad Council
 kya he united jihad counsilaatank ke ye thekedaar aapas main kyon bhide hue hai, uske jaanane se pehle ye jaananaa zaruri he ki aakhir ye united jihad council he kya
 In fact, the United Jihad Council is made up of terrorists who have only one aim
 kashmir main aatank failaana
 These different organizations, like the unguided missile, exploded here without any motive, so at the behest of Pakistani intelligence agency ISIS, they have been merged and made a council
 jise iesai apane tareeke se ghati main ashaanti failaane ke liye istemaal karata he
 Head to the council, now come on the storm which is the cause of discussion for the whole world and news of relief for India
 iesai ke ishaare par is jihad council kaa chif hijbul mujahidin ke saiyad salahuddin ko banaaya gaya tha
 But just like last year, the Indian Army, under Operation All Out, piled around 230 terrorists of Pakistan before any stir
 usase is council main sir footwwal shuru ho gai he
 Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar had made the isi's chief, Sayyid Salahuddin, the Chief of the United Jihad Council, to spread terror in Kashmir
 magar ab yahi dono aatanki salahuddin ko hataane kii sajeesh kar rahe hai
 If this is the case, it would be considered a success of the Indian Army
 haalanki jaankaar maar rahe hai ki ye pakistani khufia agency iesai kii chaal bhi ho sakati he
 So in this situation, it has to be understood what is its next plan
 salahuddin ko hataane kii sifarishapanachh yani multi agency centre or intelegence wing kii report ke mutabik haafiz said or moulana masood azhar ne hijbul ke sargana saiyad salahuddin ko hataane ke liye iesai se sifarish kii he
 It is reported that following this recommendation, the ISI wants the Hizbul Mujahideen commander, Amir Khan or Imtiaz Khan, to become Chief of Hizbul
 salahuddin ko sata rahaa he darhaalanki aisi naubat aane se pehle hi khabar he ki hijbul ke chif saiyad salahuddin ne dar kar khud hi istife kii peshkash kii he
 Because he fears that if he does not do so, he may have to face the consequences
 khabar he ki yun bhi bhartiya sena ke oparation ol out ke baad duusare aatanki sanghathan ne salahuddin ke order ko maananaa chhod diya he
 What's more, ISI itself has rejected him
 bijepi ne congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi par jamkar hamalaa bolaa he
 BJP leader and Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that Sonia ji should tell why if the Congress did a good job, then it was reduced to 44 seats
 bijepi ne sonia ke kal ke hamale ke jawaab main yah baat kahi he
 During a rally in Haryana yesterday, Sonia Gandhi said that those who shout do not work
 ravishankar prasad ne purvavarti upie sarkaar par tikhi tippanee karte hue kaha ki pehle faisle 10, janpath se hua karte the, lekin ab faisle piem awaas yani 7 aarasiar se hote hai
 He also said that India's rating has increased after Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister
 kaale dhan ke mudde par bolte hue unhone kaha ki is maamle main hamane kaaphi kuch kiya he or ab baaki ke desh bhi hamaara sahyog kar rahe hai
 It is noteworthy that Sonia had attacked the Modi government in Haryana's election rally on Saturday, saying, what happened to the promise of bringing back black money from abroad within 100 days of her coming to power? Have any steps been taken for this? off course not
 sonia ne kaha, kya keemten kam huin? kya garibon ko do june kaa khaanaa sasta milane laga yaa yuvaaon ko zyada rojgaar mili? Sonia said, no country is formed in a day
 kisi bhi desh ke vikaas ke liye kai saalon kii kadi mehnat, sahi iraadaa or balidaan kii ichha chahie hoti he
 Accusing the Modi government of sabotaging the policies of previous UPA governments, he asked people not to be influenced by hollow promises

 aapako bataa den ki diwali ke baad jab hawa main thand kaa ahsaas hona shuru hota he tab dengue kaa larva panapana band ho jaataa he kyonki use upyukt mausam or taapmaana nahin miltaa
 According to the figures released by MCD on Monday, the cases of dengue have reached 6 thousand

 noida ke thana phej-2 ilaake ke jitram colony main sab saamaanya chal rahaa tha
 People were living their normal routine
 lekin ek din apni bhabhi se milane aae ek shaks ke aane se colony main bhuuchaal aa gaya
 Suddenly the frieze of the colony started to look bloody and the colony was drowned in weeds
 laalach, insaaniyat or haivaaniyat kii yah daastaan aapako hilkaar rakh dekhi
 Not only this, you will be forced to think how much a person can fall in greed
 darasal, paise or sampatti kii bhukh main yahaan ek kiraayedaar ne apane makaan maalik or uski beti ko na sirf maut ke ghat utaara balki unki laash ko thikaane lagaakaar ghar par avaidh kabja kar maalikon kii tarah rahane laga
 After the death of husband Veer Singh in Rajabalajitaram Colony, the widow Rajbala and her daughter Priyanka lived alone
 unka sambandhiyon se milanaa-julna bhi kam ho gaya tha, aise main varshon se koi unase milane bhi nahin aayaa tha
 Bobby and his family members, who lived in the neighborhood, first grew relations with Rajbala and then moved to live as a tenant in the house
 laash ko car main band kar yamuna main bahayajankaree ke mutabik kiraayedaar banane ke baad beete saal oktober maheene main bobi ne apane doston or sambandhiyon ke saath milakar maa-beti kii hatya kar di
 The assassins used his car to hide the corpse of the widow Rajbala and her daughter
 aaropee kaa kahana he ki usne rajbala kii car main laash daalkar shavon ko yamuna main phenk diya or makaan par kabja kar liya
 The revelation of the arrival of the brother-in-law and his family had been living in Rajbala's house very chic for the last five months, but one day suddenly the brother-in-law of Rajbala came looking for them
 jaankaree ke mutabik jab devar ne apni bhabhi rajbala ke bare main poocha to bobi ne rajbala ko jaanane se inkaar kar diya
 Just here, the brother-in-law got suspicious and reported the kidnapping of Rajbala and her daughter to the police
 hatyare ne kabool kiya gunaharipart darj hone ke baad police bhi ise apharan kaa hi maamla samaj rahi thi, lekin jab raaj khulaa to sabhi sakate main aae gaye
 The assassin Bobby not only admitted the murder in the police interrogation but also gave information layer by layer of the incident
 police ne bobi or uske saale ko giraftaar kar liya he, jabaki faraar teen anya aropiyon kii giraftaar ke liye dabish de rahi he
 The corpse has not been found
 
 
 bobi ne police ko bataaya ki usne apane parivaar ore dost ke saath milakar makaan par kabja karne kii niyat se vidhwaa rajbala or uski beti priyanka kii hatya kii
 He said that after the murder, he carried the dead bodies in the Maruti 800 car of Rajbala and washed it in the Yamuna
 haalanki tamaam koshishon ke baavjood police ko rajbala or priyanka kii laash abhi tak nahin mili he
 According to the police, the neighbors said that the floor of the house has recently been built
 police ko shaq hua to usne ghar kii khudaai bhi kar daali, lekin shav baraamad nahin hue
 However, now that the police are looking for the dead body along with the absconding accused, the colony is in awe of this sensational revelation

 Where to study: Indian Institute of Carpet Technology, Bhadoheelalit Kala Institute, Jabalpur College of Arts and Craft, Uttar Pradesh sanskrit ko na sirf bharat kii balki duniya kii pracheenatam bhashaa hone kaa gaurav praapt he
 It is also believed that Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati, Oriya, Punjabi, Assamese, Gurkhali and Kashmiri are the Aryan languages which originated from the Sanskrit tradition
 sanskrit ko sabhi arya bhashaaon kii mul bhashaa siddh karte hue maxmooler ne likhaa tha ki inamen jitne shabd hai, ve sanskrit kii mahaj 500 dhaatuon se nikle hai
 We used to memorize Sanskrit shlokas in my childhood days
 hamaare shikshak kaha karte ki sanskrit bolne se jubaan saaf hoti he
 Apart from this, he would say that the computer also understands the command of Sanskrit language very easily
 kai baar firangiyon ke sharir par sanskrit ke shloke gude dikhte
 Then even though we did not understand this, but with the passage of time, we also understood that Sanskrit is indeed a very useful language
 vaise yahaan pesh hai ve kuch kaaran jinhen jaanane ke baad aapkaa sir bhi sanskrit ke sammaan main jhuk jayega -1
 The order of words does not matter much in Sanskrit
 
 
 sanskrit main vaakyon kii sanrachana apekshaakrit aasaan hoti he
 The meaning of sentences becomes clear even when words are kept here and there
 2
 Sanskrit is a language older than Latin and Hebrew
 
 
 ji haa, aap bhale hi is tathy se waakif na hon lekin bhashashastriyon ne is baat kii taakid kii he ki sanskrit hamaari duniya kii pracheenatam bhashaa he
 3
 pehle sanskrit sirf maukhik bhashaa thi
 
 
 Today, even though Sanskrit is written in Devanagari script, at first it was only oral language
 haalanki ise pehle bramhi lipi main bhi likhaa jaataa tha
 4
 bharat ke alaava nepal or indonesia bhi karte hai istemaal
 
 
 Within India, where 'satmamev Jayate' is a social message
 vahiin 'janani janmabhumishch swargadpi gariyasi' nepal kaa saarvajanik mantra he
 5
 sa dingding naamak chinis lok geet gayika ne apane gane sanskrit main likhe hai or wo unhen gaati bhi hai
 6
 duniya kii agrani vaigyanik sanstha "nasa" ke anusaar sanskrit computer ke liye sabase mufeed bhashaa he
 7
 China shabd sanskrit ke Cina se niklaa he
 It originates from the Qin dynasty of China
 burma ko bramhadesh se liya gaya he
 Sri Sri signifies holy
 8
 Sanskrit is taught in Germany
 
 
 vaise to duniya ke harek desh main aaj sanskrit kii demand he lekin germany main isakikhaasi demandahai
 There are 14 universities in Germany alone that offer Sanskrit courses
 9
 There are also Sanskrit newspapers in India
 
 
 ho saktaa he ki aap sanskrit ke akhabaaron se waakif na hon lekin "sudharma" naamak sanskrit akhbaar saal 1970 se hi astitv main he
 It can also be read online
 10
 Yoga and Sanskrit are interwoven into each other
 
 
 yoga ke tamaam asana ke naam sanskrit bhashaa se aate hai
 It is evident that Sanskrit and Yoga are closely related to each other
 11
 Sanskrit is the dialect of the villages of India
 
 
 bharat ke bheetar aise do gaanv bhi hai jahaan log puri tarah sanskrit bolte-batiyate hai
 The names of these villages are Mattur and Hosahalli
 aaj bhale hi sarkarein or desh kii ganmaanya sansthaaen sanskrit bhashaa ke behatari kii baaten karti hon lekin jamini vaastaviktaa usase ekadam bhinn he
 Even today, their use is only symbolic
 ham sirf unhen kinhin kirthan-bhajan main hi sunate hai
 So the real need is that we start practicing Sanskrit
 chaahe sarkaar isamen hamaari madad kare yaa na kare
 After all, we can do so much for our favorite Sanskrit

 magar kuch varisht patrakaron ke mutabiq manya ek chota-motaa apradhi tha, jo bahut taaqatvar nahin tha or mumbai kaa pehla encounter bhi manya kaa nahin, balki 1980 main luvis furnandis kaa hua tha
 The comments jo bhi ho, ham gangs or gangsters kii sachai par nahin, balki film par agar baat karen, to yah film manya surve or uskaa encounter karne vaale police ofisar isaac bagwaan kii he, jise behtareen dhang se dikhaaya gaya he
 Director Sanjay Gupta has put the story on screen well
 jon abraham or anil kapur ne acha abhinay kiya he
 Manoj Bajpayee has done justice to his role
 tushaar kapur or sonu sood kaa kaam bhi acha he
 It would have been even better if the film had no abuses
 kahani ke hisaab se film thodi lambii lagati he, lekin film angeging he
 There are sizzling songs and excellent dialogues are also mixed, so my rating for 'shootout at Wadala' is 3
 5 star
 
 
 But according to some senior journalists, Manya was a petty criminal, who was not very powerful and Mumbai's first encounter was not of Manya but of Louis Lewis Fernandes in 1980
 tippaniyan However, if we talk about the truth of the gangs and the gangsters, but not on the film, then the film is of Manya Surve and her encounter police officer Isaac Bagwan, which is shown in the best manner
 nirdeshak sanjay gupta ne kahani ko achche se parde par utaara he
 John Abraham and Anil Kapoor have done well
 manoj bajpeyi ne apane role ke saath puraa insaaf kiya he
 The work of Tusshar Kapoor and Sonu Sood is also good
 agar film main gaaliyon kaa istemaal na hota, to or bhi acha hota
 According to the story, the film seems a bit long, but the film is engaging
 tadakate-bhadakte gane hai or behtareen dialogs kaa saath bhi mila he, isliye 'shootout at wadala' ke liye meri reating he 3
 5 stars

 boat house ke bare main aapane suna or padhaa hoga, par kya aapane kabhi aise gaanv yaa kisi samudaay ke bare main suna he jo hameshaa pani main hi rahete hai or bahari duniya se na to milanaa chaahate hai or na hi koi tallukaat rakhana chaahate hai
 There is one such village on earth whose every person lives in water for 24 hours
 ji haa
 This is not a hypothetical thing, but a fact

 Know who was the first heroine of Indian cinema, whose 4 minute kissing scene surprised
 
 
 yah basti 1300 saal puraani he or yahaan kareeb-kareeb 8500 log rahete hai
 But what is surprising is how such a large number of people live on water
 ningde city main basii yah basti duniya kaa ekmaatr aisa gaanv he jo puri tarah se gahare samudr par basaa hua he
 All the people living in this village are fishermen, who are called
 is samudaay ke sabhi log naavon par hi apana ghar banaakar rahete hai
 Fishes die and from that their livelihood too

 These fishermen gradually made the boats their home to save their family
 jab kabhi khatra najar aata ye naavon ko samudr main dur le jate
 The family of these fishermen in South East China, Badastur, are still living in their traditional boat houses
 ek aisi singer jo gane se zyada apane style se he 'femes'chuki ye hameshaa samudr main tairte rahete hai isliye taanka jati ke logon ko 'gypsys of da si' bhi kaha jaataa he
 These people neither come to the shore nor have any relationship with the people living outside the sea

 Her fame is as Amma with a rupee idli

 But in this era of social media, his story has become a little easier after reaching the famous people of the country
 unhen ab lakdi kaa chulhaa nahin foonkna hoga
 Due to the intervention of industrialists Anand Mahindra and Dharmendra Pradhan, they have got free LPG connection
 yahaan chote dhabon main aamtaur par jahaan idli 10 rupee or bade restaraan main 50 rupee tak main milti he, lekin kamalaatal hai ki apane thihe par pichley 30 saal se logon kii bhukh shant karne ke liye sasti idli kaa yah anokhaa vyapaar kar rahi hai
 Even at this age, she is selling about 600 idlis with sambar-coconut chutney at the rate of Re 1
 One of those humbling stories that make you wonder if everything you do is even a fraction as impactful as the work of people like Kamalathal
 i notice she still uses a wood-burning stove
 If anyone knows her I'd be happy to ‘invest' in her business & buy her an LPG fueled stove

 shuruyaat main vah 25 paise main idli bechati thim
 With the cost of rice, urad dal and coconut rising, they have now reduced the price of idli to Re 1
 unke liye yah ek tarah se saamaajik vyapaar he
 There is more service value attached to profits
 kamalaatal savere chaar baje uthakar akele sari taiyaari main jute jaati hai
 His shop is crowded with students, government and private companies employees, drivers and daily wage workers
 inhen ke bich main kisi ne unki idli kii dukaan ke bare main soshal media par daal diya or baat viral hote hue mahindra and mahindra samooh ke pramukh anand mahindra tak pahunch gayi
 At the same time the Collector of Coimbatore

 He assured Kamalatal all possible help from getting a house under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana
 mahindra kamalaatal kii kahani se abhibhoot hue or unhen lakdi kaa chulhaa phunkate hue dekhakar unhen muft gas stove or rasoi gas conection dene kii baat kahi
 She recently tweeted, 'I saw that she (kamalatala) still cooks on a wood stove
 yadi koi unhen jaanata he to main unke vyapaar main ‘nivesh' karnaa chahta hum or unhen ek alpiji stove kharidkar dena chahta hum
 On this, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan interfered and Bharat Gas Coimbatore provided him with a gas connection
 This is superb
 Thank you Bharat Gas Coimbatore for giving this gift of health to Kamalathal
 As i have already stated, i am happy to support her continuing costs of using LPG

 NITI Aayog Deputy Chairman Rajiv Kumar said on Tuesday that the Indian currency should be allowed to find its natural level and the belief in people to consider the strong rupee better is an illusion

 He underlined the potential for large number of job creation in the export sector, saying that if the rupee is strong, it aids imports and encourages the rich to travel more
 unhone kaha ki desh kai samasyaon se bharaa hua he jisamen niryaat ke liye lagane vaali laagat shaamil he, jaise ki mahangi bijli or mahangi puunji
 Therefore, the best approach the world is adopting is to allow the currency to find its proper value
 unhone kaha, 'or yahi rupee ke saath bhi ho rahaa he
 Asked when the rupee will improve against the kidnapper, he said that when every youth gets good employment, then the Indian currency will strengthen
 aalochakon ko jawaab dete hue kaha, 'hamaari prati vyakti aay abhi ke 2,000 rupee se badhkar 5000 rupee tak hone ke baad rupee main majbootee aegi (aisa tab hoga jab hamaare yuvaaon ko rojgaar milegaa)
