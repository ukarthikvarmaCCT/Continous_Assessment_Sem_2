 Chief Minister J
 jayalalita apane dost se adhiktam laabh uthaanaa chaahati hai, aakhir 37 loksabhaa or 10 rajyasabha saansadon kii takat jo he unke paas
 This was the first meeting after Modi became bjp's prime ministerial candidate on September 2013 when Jayalalithaa came to meet him on June 3 with a list of his demands
 modi ke saath unke rishte hameshaa se hi mithe rahe hai lekin loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan ve unase dur hi raheen
 But he never hesitated to praise Modi's Gujarat model during the good days of friendship
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke rup main modi ke teenon shapath grahan samaaroh 2002, 2007 or 2012 main ve shaamil huin
 So Modi was also present at the swearing-in ceremony of Jayalalithaa as Chief Minister in May 2011
 lekin tamilnadu vidhansabha chunaav zyada dur nahin he or srilankai tamilon kaa maamla abhi ubaal par he, isliye ve modi ke pradhanmantri pad ke shapath grahan samaaroh main nahin ain kyonki ve srilanka ke raashtrapati mahindra rajpakshe ke saath najar aane kaa jokhim nahin lenaa chaahati thim
 Rajapaksa was invited to the ceremony
 iske baavjood endie jayalalita ko khush rakhana chahega, bhale hi unki maang suchi khaasi lambii or baari-bharkam he
 Not only because they will get the support of their 10 mps in the Rajya Sabha (where the number of NDA mps is less) but as senior political analyst Ahmed Shabbir says, "it is also about cooperation
" modi sarkaar pratyaksh videshi nivesh (epadi) jaise kuch kade nitigat faisle le sakati he, aise main rajnatik dalon kii aam sahmati darshaya janaa sarkaar ke hit main ho saktaa he
 If Jayalalithaa opposes them, the Trinamool Congress (TMC), Biju Janata Dal (BJD) and the Left parties can also join her
 or bijepi modi ke agenda kaa virodh karne waalon ko ekajute hote kabhi nahin dekhnaa chaahegi
 "but some of the demands in Tamil Nadu may also pose a challenge for Modi
 cells tex ke 7,000 karod ru
 Returns immediately, which are payable by the Central Government
 jayalalita ne dilli se ve 4,000 karod ru
 They have also demanded that they spend under the centrally sponsored schemes
 unka rajya bijli kii tangi se do-chaar ho rahaa he, isliye ve chaahati hai ki rajya main kendriya bijligharon se jo bijli vitarit nahin kii gai (kul 450 megawatt) modi uskaa 15 fisadi rajya ko den
 These include commissioned units of Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, Neyveli Lignite Corporation of Tuticorin and JV Project of NTPC at Vellore
 kaveri mudda bhi rajya main bhaawanaaon ko bhadakaane kaa kaam kar rahaa he, lihaaja jayalalita ne kaveri management board or jal niyaman samiti kii maang kii he jo 2007 ke kaveri jal vivaad panchat ke antim faisle ko lagu kar sake
 It was notified by the UPA government in 2013
 ek baar board or cameti kaa faisla lagu ho gaya to tamilnadu ke paas nadi par bane baandh ke jal kapaat kholane kaa adhikaar aa jayega, jisase rajya main pani aa jayega
 Says a state bureaucrat, "though we won the case against Karnataka in the Supreme Court, but it is not implementing the order of the Supreme Court and is not giving us the requisite water as it still has the right to manage the water plants
" 
 ‚Äù modi ko karnataka main bijepi ko iske liye raji karnaa hoga kyonki yah mudda yahaan bhi utana hi bada or mahatvapurn he
 Jayalalithaa's other demands also include a performance grant under the 13th Finance Commission, which provided Rs 1,888 crore for 2011-12 to 2014-15
 dene kii sifarish kii thi
 But till now Rs 125 crore
 hi mili hai
 Jayalalithaa claims that her state fulfilled six of the nine conditions and also worked heavily on the remaining three
 saamaanya cells tex (jiesti) bhi ek anya mudda he jise ve chaahati hai ki modi sulajhaa len
 He emphasized that the proposed GST issue would affect the autonomy of his state and that the loss would be permanent, it would also have a negative impact on production and exports
 jayalalita ne ek vikalp sujhaayaa he, ve chaahati hai ki ek rajya main tex ugaahi, waite ke vikalp ke rup main tex vasuuli or swyttikaran, kendriya utpaada shulk or sarvice tex kaa adhikaar rajya ko hi diya janaa chahie jabaki centre antarraji karadhaan par hi focus kar rahaa he
 Jayalalitha raised an additional Rs 10,000 crore for the modernization of the state police
 kii bhi maang rakhi he
 In addition, the state wants to keep Transport Corporation free of double fuel prices
 lekin modi ke liye unki rajnatik maangen puri karnaa zyada mushkil hoga
 Jayalalithaa wants India to come up with a proposal to criticize Sri Lanka for 'genocide' in the civil war at the United Nations
 ve yah bhi chaahati hai ki sarkaar srilankai tamilon or duniyabar ke visthapit tamilon ke bich alag 'ilam‚Äô ke liye janamat sangrah karwaane kaa prastaav rakhe
 He also believes that Modi should withdraw Katchatheevu from Sri Lanka
 paak jaldamru-madhya main 285 acre kii jameen bhatak gaye tamil machuaaron ke khilaaf karrwai karne ke liye srilanka nausena kaa aadhaar rahi he
 Another demand of Jayalalithaa is that Narendra Modi terminate the 1974 and 1976 agreements under which the island was given to Sri Lanka
 1991 main tamilnadu vidhansabha ne ek prastaav bhi paarit kiya tha, jiske tahat yah dweep or uske aasapaas kaa samudr bharat ko diya janaa tha
 Jayalalithaa's petition has been pending in the Supreme Court since 2008
 eiediemke ke varisht netaaon ko ummid he ki modi ye maangen maan lenge
 Since becoming Chief Minister in 2011, Jayalalithaa has been fighting the Center, sending dozens of messengers to the then Prime Minister, though most did not receive any response
 unke virodh or maangon main sab kuch shaamil tha, srilanka sena kaa tamil machuaaron ke apharan or hamale se lekar bijli dene main sarkaar kii udaseenta‚Äîor bhi bahut kuch
 She has also been a vocal critic of the upa's decorative program Food Security Bill
 unhone manmohan singh ko likhaa tha, ''ek sangheey dhaanche main jahaan rajyon kaa janata ke saath nikat sambandh hota he yojanaon ko banane or lagu karne kaa haq rajyon ko hi hona chahie
 ‚Äùhe also said that this would cost the state government Rs 1,800 crore
 kaa atirikt bhaar padegaa
 "we have laddoos in both our hands," says a party leader

 From April 1, rickshaw will not run without registration in Chandni Chowk, which is counted as the busiest markets of our country's capital
 hai court ne yah aadesh chandani chowk sundarikaran maamle main diya he
 It is worth noting that many petitions were going on in the High Court regarding the Chandni Chowk Redevolution
 sunwaayee ke dauraan kai baar sawaal uthe ki is ilaake main lagane vaale jam main rickshaw badi vajah hai
 There are many rickshaws that run without a registry in these areas
 hai court ne is maamle main bade camp lagane ke die aadeshhai court ne rickshon ke registration karaane ke liye do baar baden camp lagane ke aadesh bhi agenciyon ko die the
 About 500 rickshaws have also been registered in this camp
 jo nahi hue hai ve ab ek april ke baad chandani chowk ke ilaake main nahin chal paaenge
 Significantly, there are more than 20 lakh rickshaws all over Delhi and more than 50 thousand rickshaws are being run in this area every day
 haalanki registration sirf 500-600 rickshon kaa hi ho paaya he
 The purpose of this registration is not only to identify the drivers but also to keep the rickshaws running illegally
 gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon ne kii he yachikachandani chowk main aksar trephic jam kii hi samasya bani rahati he
 Questions have also been raised about the existence of this historical area
 hai courtpahale kuch yachikaaon kii sunwaayee ke baadachaandani chaukamen rickshaw chalaane ko bain kar chukaa tha lekin phir kuch gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon ne yachika lagaai ki isse hajaaron log berozegaar ho jaaenge
 Therefore, they should be allowed to run with registration

 In 1967, when a Bhamashah gave land for this, many gave money

 But nobody's name was buried anywhere
 pustkaalay ke prabharee kapoorchand betala bataate hai, ''naam na likhe jane kii shart par hi logon se aarthik madad lee gai he
 People with money make money and write names, but what about those people who have worked hard for this, worked hard
 '' sarkaar se bhi madad kii chitthee ai lekin prabandh samiti ke logon ne ise lene se saaf inkaar kar diya kyonki ve nahin chaahate the ki isaki dasha bhi duusare sarkari pustakaalayon jaisi ho

 buraadi samuhik khudakushi cond main ab aisa lag rahaa he ki parivaar ke chote bete lalit kii maansik beemaari ne hi 11 sadasyon kii jaan le lee
 Lalit was the victim of a mental illness that caused him to see his father in his dream and he tried to follow his father's orders
 uske ghar se tantra mantra vidya se judi kitaaben bhi mili hai
 Most importantly, the whole family trusted Lalit a lot
 jab aadhyatm nazariye ko andhaa kar de to vahi hota he joburadike is ghar main hua
 Police are suspecting the role of Lalit, the younger son of the family, behind the dead bodies hanging from the roof of 11 people
 mana ja rahaa he ki lalit ne hi bhagwaan se saakshaat bhent kii chahat jagaakar parivaar ko samuhik khudakushi kii taraf dhakel diya
 In the police investigation, the needle of suspicion is now turning towards Lalit
 aisa lag rahaa he ki ho na ho lalit maansik beemaari kaa shikaar tha
 Relatives say Lalit started talking in his father's voice for a few months
 pita kii maut ke baad uskaa daawa tha ki pita use dikhaai dete hai
 It seems that Lalit was a victim of an illness called Shared Psychotic Disorder or Delusions
 iske shikaar logon ko lagata he ki uske kaanon main koi kuch kah rahaa he
 Victims of this disease want to make others feel the same as what they are doing
 bataaya ja rahaa he lalit apane mrit pita ke sapane main aane kii baat kaha karata tha
 No rope was also tied in Lalit's hands, after which the entire investigation has become focused on him
 krime branch lalit ke jivan kaa itihaas khangaalane main jute gai he
 Police are trying to know that -01
 kya lalit bana maut kaa mastermind?02
 Who were Lalit's friends? 03
 lalit kii lifestil kya thi?04
 Who was closer to Lalit? 05
 lalit kaa milanaa-julna kisase tha?06
 Whom did Lalit talk to on the phone? 07
 kya lalit apane pita ke sabase kareeb tha?08
 When did he start thinking about seeing his dead father? 09
 lalit kii awaz kaise gai or kaise lauti?police ko ghar main mandir ke paas jo register mila he, usamen ek hi handriting main nots likhe hai
 This writing looks like Lalit only
 disambar 2017 se is register ko likhaa ja rahaa tha, or 26 june ko register ke chaar pej ek saath bhare gaye
 It seems that the whole family used to trust Lalit's words about handwriting
 ye anushthan bhi lalit ke hisaab se hi kiya gaya
 The act of hanging the hanging flag is also said to be part of this ritual
 postmortem report ke mutabik faansee lagaae jane ke din parivaar ke kai logon ne khaanaa nahin khaaya
 As the wedding preparations were going on in the house and renovation was taking place in the house, it seems that Lalit was confident that even hanging on the noose would save their lives
 afsos ki ye nahin hua or ek bharaa-puraa parivaar ujaad gaya

 i have said many times before that the five people of the Congress Party, whose names i openly take several times, were involved in these riots and the law is doing its work on them, but i want to ask Modi ji If you are holding Rajiv Gandhi responsible for the 1984 Sikh riots, then should we hold you responsible for Godhra? Because you were also the Chief Minister of that state at that time
 bijepi par nishaanaa sadhate hue siem amarinder ne kaha ki jahaan tak mujhe jaankaree he rajeev gandhi us vakt bengal yaa bihar main baithe hue the, jab unhen indira gandhi ji kii mrityu kii khabar mili
 How can they have their hands in such riots? duusari baat ye jo kaha ja rahaa he ki rajeev gandhi apane offis se puure dangon ko monitor kar rahe the

 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi has demanded a ban on polygamy in Muslims like having four marriages
 unhone kaha ki desh main kanoon banaakar bahu-vivaah pratha par roak lagani chahie
 Sushil Modi said that there are three divorces and polygamy social evils
 argedy ne susheel kumaar modi ke is bayaan par pratikriya dete hue kaha ki susheel modi ko musalamaanon kii bahut chintaa he lekin unke bijepi ke shashan main jo daliton par atyaachaar ho rahaa he uskaa kya
 RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari said, "kisushil Modi is worried about polygamy among Muslims, but i want to know from him whether his party considers Dalits to be Hindus or not?" As far as the concern of Sushil Modi is concerned, running a single family with a wife in this era of inflation is like climbing the Himalayas, so who has four wives
 jis prakaar bhima koregaanv main hindutvvaadiyon ne daliton par hamalaa kiya isse to yahi sabit hota he ki wo log daliton ko hindu nahin maanate
 After the formation of Sushil Modi's party government at the Center, there has been a huge increase in anti-dalit incidents
 musalmaan or dalitadonon tathakthith gaurakshakon ke shikaar ho rahe hai
 Those who are struggling to get the right to justice for Dalits are considered a threat to the security of the country
 unhone kaha ki susheel modi kii jamaat insaanon ke bich barabari ke siddhant ko nahin maanati he
 They do not believe in the Indian Constitution
 ye log samvidhan ko badalakar manusmriti ke aadhaar par shashan chalaanaa chaahate hai
 It is not their objective to organize Hindu society on the basis of social equality by eradicating ethnic non-equality
 ye musalamaanon or isaaiyon ke khilaaf nafrat failaakar hindu vot bank bananaa chaahate hai
 RJD will not allow their plans to be completed on the soil of Bihar

 State Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who is facing the bjp's attack due to not celebrating Yoga Day in Bihar, on Sunday in front of the BJP raised questions
 nitish kumaar ne pradhanmantri, narendra modi se poocha ki kya yoga main sharaab pine kii anumati di jaati he? agar nahin to kya unka daayitv nahin hai ki yoga diwas ke uplakshya main sharaab kii kareed bikri par pehle pabandi lagaayi jaae
 At least if the Prime Minister had declared the ban in the bjp-ruled state, yoga would have been respected
 nitish ravivaar ko jharkhand ke palamu main sharabbandi ke mudde par yojit mahilaon ke ek sabha ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 In Jharkhand, Nitish Kumar had also attended a women's conference in Dhanbad earlier, where Babulal Narani of Jharkhand Vikas Morcha openly joined him on this issue
 nitish ne aaj bhi doharaaya kii jharkhand main agar logon ne saath diya to babulal mukhyamantri honge
 The comments yoga diwas ke mudde par apni aalochana par nitish ne khulkar jawaab diya or kaha ki mujhe maaloom nahin ki pradhanmantri kab se yoga kar rahe hai lekin main varshon se yoga ke asana, pranayam or yoga nindra niyamit rup se karata rahaa
 But alcohol is not allowed in yoga
 unhone kaha, pradhanmantri ji bina sharaab par pabandi lagaae kaisaa yoga diwas manaaya ja rahaa he
 Nitish alleged that by turning everything into an event, attention is diverted from the original subject, if the Prime Minister wants to celebrate Yoga Day, first ban the sale of liquor, after that i will also stand with you
 nitish ne jharkhand ke mukhyamantri raghuvar das par bolte hue kaha ki sharaab bandi ke mudde par bihar kaa samarthan karne ke bajaay unhone puure rajya main sharaab kii bikri badha di jo sabit karata hai ki jharkhand sarkaar is mudde par kitna gambheer he
 Nitish was addressing a gathering of women on Sunday on the issue of prohibition in Palamu, Jharkhand
 jharkhand main nitish kumaar ne isse purv dhanbad main bhi ek mahilaon ke sammelan main bhaag liya tha jahaan jharkhand vikaas morcha ke babulal naarangi khul kar is mudde par unke saath aae the
 Nitish reiterated that Babulal would be the chief minister if people supported him in Jharkhand
 tippaniyan On his criticism on the issue of Yoga Day, Nitish responded openly and said that i do not know how long the Prime Minister has been doing yoga but i have been doing yoga asanas, pranayama and yoga nidra regularly for years
 lekin yoga main sharaab ke seven kii anumati nahin di jaati
 He said, what kind of yoga day is being celebrated without the Prime Minister banning alcohol
 nitish ne aarope lagaaya ki har chiz ko ek event main badal kar mul vishay se dhyaan bhatakaaya jaataa he agar pradhanmantri ji aap yoga diwas manaanaa chaahate hai to pehle sharaab bikri par pabandi lagaaein, uske baad main bhi aapke saath khadaa rahoonga
 Speaking on Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghuvar Das, Nitish said that instead of supporting Bihar on the issue of liquor ban, he increased liquor sales across the state which proves how serious the Jharkhand government is on the issue
 yoga diwas ke mudde par apni aalochana par nitish ne khulkar jawaab diya or kaha ki mujhe maaloom nahin ki pradhanmantri kab se yoga kar rahe hai lekin main varshon se yoga ke asana, pranayam or yoga nindra niyamit rup se karata rahaa
 But alcohol is not allowed in yoga
 unhone kaha, pradhanmantri ji bina sharaab par pabandi lagaae kaisaa yoga diwas manaaya ja rahaa he

 Are you also one of those people who stay united day and night to get rid of their growing weight and belly fat? iske saath hi aapke aatmavishvaas ko bhi badhaata he
 However, there is another side to this
 'acchhee body' paane ke baad aapkaa saamana kai aise badlaavon se hota he, jinke bare main aapane shaayad kabhi sochaa bhi nahin hoga
 Know 5 such important things
 
 
 1
 You will not be able to digest your changed body so easily! There are many people who have lost many kilos of weight, who are unable to fully balance with their new body
 lagbhag 83 poundvajan ghataanevaale karston griffin ne angreji akhbaar hafington post ko bataaya, 'vajan ghataane ke 2 saal baad bhi main is baat se pareshaan hum ki maine kya kiya? vajan ghataana to kaaphi aasaan tha, lekin uske baad mili nai kaaya ko pachaa paanaa mere liye rojaanaa kaa sangharsh ban gaya
 According to clinical psychologist Ed Abramson, people think that a new physique will be like a miracle, but the reality is different
 aapako is nai kaaya ko apnaane main thodaa vakt lagata he, lekin ekbar jab aap ise apnaanaa sikh jate hai to sabakuch thik hone lagata he
 2
 vajan to gata liya par extra skin kaa kya?aapane agar kaaphi acchhee maatra main vajan ghataya he to is baat kii puri sambhaavna he ki aapako jhurriyon or stretch ke nishaanon ko jhelana pad saktaa he or sabase niraash karne vaali baat yah he ki charbi ghatane ke baad bachi is extra skin se bachane ke liye surgery ke alaava koi doosraa opshan maujuud nahin he
 Money is spent in this surgery, along with it some bad effects can also come out
 isliye, is pahalu par bhi pehle se soch len
 3
 kuch rishton main bhi badlaav ke liye taiyaar rahen!kuch paane ke liye kuch khona to padataa hi he na! is baat kii puri sambhaavna he ki vajan ghataane ke liye kii ja rahi aapaki tamaam koshishen aapako kai logon se dur kar dengi, kyonki aapke khan-paan, uthne-baithne jaisi kai aadaten badalane vaaleen hai
 Along with these changes, you will have to sweat a lot to stay connected with your loved ones
 4
 The old jeans and that t-shirt will no longer accompany the new body after the weight loss is going to require new clothes and it is not possible without loosening your pocket
 to apane pahanaave or rahan-sahan par nae sire se kharch karne ke liye taiyaar ho jaaie
 However, do not rush into shopping for new clothes and gradually introduce your wardrobe to new friends
 5
 Friend is no longer that friend! It is very likely that your people, who are feeling the change coming in you, will start giving many suggestions for your well-being, which will pass you on exasperating
 isliye jaruri he ki aisi 'salahon' ko dil par naa len or apane lakshya par puri tarah se dhyaan den
 When Rajinikanth announced his foray into politics on December 31, Tamil Nadu BJP President Tamilisai Saundararajan immediately said that the BJP 'welcomes his (rajinikanth) thinking of spiritual politics
 ' jaahir he, dharm virdohi raajnneeti ke lambey asar vaale is dravid rajya main bhagava dal ko apni dharm se judi siyasat ke liye jagah banati dikhne lagi he jiskaa use lambey samay se intjaar tha
 In fact, Tamil Nadu has been at the center of the DMK and AIADMK, both major parties with insurgent politics from the very beginning
 in dalon ke netaa mandiron main jate bhi hai to vah vyaktigat hota he
 In such a situation, Tamil Nadu has been a barren land for the BJP
 bhaajapa kii vichaardhaara ke mul main hindutv he or rajya main uski jameen taiyaar karne laayak party ke paas koi kaddavar netaa bhi nahin he
 However, the BJP planned Yogi Adityanath's journey from Ayodhya to Rameswaram last November
 yatra farvari madhya ke liye tay kii gai he
 N
 of Tamil Nadu politics
 ashokan kehete hai, ''yogi adityanath kii yatra se dharm se judi siyasat kii charchaa to hogi lekin dharm, siyasat main koi factor tabhi banegaa jab rajya kaa koi bada yaa prasiddh cheharaa paroksh yaa pratyaksh rup se ise charchaa main laae
 Talking about spiritual politics on behalf of Rajinikanth can indirectly help BJP
 ''rajnikant bhaajapa kaa samarthan karenge yaa nahin, yah to abhi tay nahin he lekin bhaajapa unhen saadhane kii koshish main lambey samay se lagi rahi he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has met her in 2014
 bhaajapa sutron kaa kahana he ki bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne rajnikant ke maamle ko kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ko saunp rakhaa he
 Gadkari has been in touch with him since last month
 bhaajapa yuva morcha kii rashtriya adhyaksh punam mahajan pichley agast main rajnikant se mil chuki hai
 In the meeting with BJP general secretaries on 25 December last, the way Amit Shah refused to pursue the plan made for Tamil Nadu so far is also being linked to the Rajinikanth episode
 baithak main amit shah ne saaf kar diya tha ki bhaajapa ko philhal na to dramuk or na hi annadramuk ke saath jane kaa faisla karnaa chahie
 Says Tamil Nadu BJP in-charge Muralidhar Rao, "there will be no discussion on the issue of whether the BJP will fight in Tamil Nadu itself or form an alliance with anyone
" '' kya rajnikant bhaajapa kaa samarthan karenge? is prashn par muralidhar raav to chuppi saadh gaye lekin tamilnadu bhaajapa pramukh tamilisai kahati hai, ''rajanikant aadhyatmik raajnneeti kii pairokari kar rahe hai or ve bhrashtachar ke khilaaf bhi hai
 This is the view of BJP, therefore they will not be opposed to BJP
 ''matlab saaf he ki rajnikant bhale bhaajapa ke saath saamne se na dikhen lekin ve jis raajnneeti kii baat kar rahe hai, use khilne main bhaajapa maahir he
 Anyway, Rajinikanth is talking about contesting the 2021 assembly elections and the bjp's target at this time is the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 rajnikant ke paas sanghathan abhi nahin he jabaki bhaajapa kaa thodaa-bahut sanghathan bhi he, uske paas sansaadhan bhi he or aresas ke rup main pitru sanghathan bhi he
 The BJP can help Rajinikanth create an organization, if not directly
 jis tarah bhaajapa ke netaa lagaataar unase taratamya baitaane main safal rahe hai, usase yah saaf ho jaataa he ki bhaajapa rajnikant ko tamilnadu main apane lonching pad kii tarah dekhati he
 At present, the BJP is assuming that the DMK and AIADMK, both major parties of the state, are in a shaky state
 annadramuk main netritv kaa sankat he
 M
 in the DMK karunanidhi ke baad viraasat kaa sawaal sulajhana abhi baaki he
 In such a situation, the BJP is hopeful that if Rajinikanth manages to establish himself with the thinking of spiritual politics, it will not take long for him to make a place in the state
 bhaajapa ke rashtriya sachiv ech
 Says Raja, "in Tamil Nadu, showing oneself as non-theistic was a fashion for political parties
" rajnikant ne jis aadhyatmik raajnneeti kii baat kii he, ham uskaa swaagat karte hai kyonki hindu virdohi raajnneeti ke paraabhav kaa vakt aa gaya he
 '' ipies afasar amitabh thakur ne kendriya grih mantralay se anurodh kiya he ki unhen uttar pradesh se kisi anya cader main bheja jaae
 Telling Mulayam Singh Yadav that danger of life in Rule 5 (2) of IPS Cadre Rules, Amitabh said in his application that he and his social worker wife Dr
 nutan thakurko sapa pramukh mulaayam singh yadav se jaan ko khatra he
 Mulayam had also threatened him on the phone
 khanan mantri gayatri prajapati ke khilaaf nutan ne lokayukta ko shikaayat kii thi
 Amitabh has said that these people are very powerful and in such circumstances it would be appropriate to change their cadre
 maharashtra ke sarkari jeje hospitals grant medical college kii chaatraon ne 'choti skirt' naa pahanane or kaaryakramon ke dauraan purush saathiyon se alag baithne ke farmaan ke khilaaf ravivaar ko pradarshan kiya
 He claimed that through this order, officers are trying for 'moral Policing'
 adhikariyon ne 21 march ko holi ke ek kaarykram ke baad ye nirdesh jari kiye
 In the program, some youths created ruckus and abusive behavior in the premises of the prestigious medical institute
 adhikariyon ke circular ke khilaaf asahmati jataate hue chaatraon ne ravivaar ko takhne tak kapade pahanakar or apana cheharaa dhankkar pradarshan kiya
 a protesting student said that the college administration shared posts detailing these instructions on Facebook and whatsapp group of girls residing in the hostel
 is bare main santhaan ke dean dow ajay chandanvaale ne kaha 'chaatraon se apeksha he ki ve uchit paridhaan pahanen
 This is my message to the students

 '(input-bhashaa) The government has told parliament, citing security agencies, that Pakistan-based terrorist organizations have ordered 'sea jihad' against India
 grih rajya mantri hansraj gangaaraam ahir ne buudhvaar ko rajyasabha main ek sawaal ke likhit jawaab main yah jaankaree di
 Asked whether the government was aware of the Pakistani militant group's concept of maritime jihad, Ahir said, "as per the available inputs, Pakistan-based organizations have ordered their members for 'maritime jihad' against India
" ''ahir ne haalanki kisi aatankwaadi sanghathan dwaara pattan, swatantra samudri kshetra main cargo tathaa tel ke tankeron par 26 / 11 ke aatanki hamale kii tarah kaa hamalaa karne kaa koi vishisht input nahin hone kii sadan ko jaankaree di

 kya dilli kii arvind kejariwal sarkaar kisaanon ko is baar bhi muaavja degi? somvaar ko siem kejariwal ke ek twit ne kisaanon ko ummid baandhne kii vajah de di
 Kejriwal tweeted that the Divisional Commissioner has been asked to assess the crop damage caused by the unseasonal rains in Delhi
 jab narela ke vidhayak or rajasav vibhaag ke sansadeey sachiv sharad chouhan se is bare main poocha gaya, to unhone kaha ki kisaanon ko nuksaan to hua he or abhi nuksaan kaa akalan chal rahaa he
 The way we paid compensation to farmers last time, we will definitely do something for them this time too
 bemausam barish or ola vrishti ne uttar pradesh, punjab, haryana samet dilli main bhi fasalon ko kaaphi nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 According to the farmers of Kheda Khurd village in northwest Delhi, this time the wheat crop has suffered more than the last time, so the Kejriwal government should pay more compensation than the last time
 kheda khurd gaanv ke kisaan sundar ne 3 acre jameen kiraaye par lekar gehun lagaaya tha, lekin sab barbaad ho gaya
 Sundar says that about 80 percent of the crop has gone bad
 unka 8 logon kaa parivaar mukhya rup se kheti par nirbhar he, lekin fasal kharaab hone se kai chunautiyaan saamne khadi he
 The comments do acre main gehun kii kheti karne vaale kisaan chand ram ne bataaya ki unka nuksaan pichhali baar se zyada he, isliye kejariwal sarkaar ne jahaan pichley saal 14,000 rupee acre kaa muawza diya tha, vahiin is saal muaavja kam se kam 20,000 to hona hi chahie
 According to Khera Khurd's farmer Rampat, this time the crop has become so bad that there will be nothing left for the animals to eat themselves
 vaise dilli main bahut zyada kheti nahin hoti, lekin pichley saal siem kejariwal ne pehali baar 20,000 rupee acre kaa muaavja dekar dilli main kisaanon ko muaavja dene kii parampara shuru kii thi or nunatam 14,000 rupee acre ke hisaab se muaavja diya tha
 Therefore, the eyes are now on Kejriwal's announcement

 The two young men, Imran Gardi and Pratap Rathore, were stunting on the security railing near the trench, alerting the rest of the citizens
 lekin sharaab kaa nasha dimag par haaavee hone ke kaaran unhone ek naa suni or jis baat kaa dar tha vahi hua
 One slipped his leg and the other fell with him into the ditch

 The rescue team was keen that if there was any life between the two, they should be immediately rescued by hospitalization

 Rohit Sharma, one of India's best batsmen in odis, believes that Mahendra Singh Dhoni's decision to give up his limited overs captaincy in the 50-over format was a career change for him
 rohit ne vishesh intervyuu main kaha, ‚Äòmujhe lagata he ki vanade maichon main pari shuru karne ke faisle ne meraa kariyar badal diya or yah faisla mahendra singh dhoni ne kiya tha
 After that i became a better batsman
 isse mujhe apana khel behatar tareeke se samajhane main madad mili or main sthiti ke anusaar behatar pratikriya de paaya
 Rohit first played an opener during the home series against England in early 2013
 unhone is siries main 80 ke aasapaas ran banaae or phir champions trophy main thos pradarshan kiya
 In reference to Dhoni asking for the start of the innings, Rohit said, "he (dhoni) came to me and said" i want you to start the innings because i am sure you will do well
 ‚Äô tum cat or pul shot, donon acha khel sakate ho isliye tumhaare andar salaami ballebaaj ke rup main safal hone kaa gun he
 "he said," Dhoni told me that we are not scared of failures and disappointed with the criticisms
 vah badi tasviir dekh rahe the kyonki us saal england main champions trophy honi thi
 According to Rohit, Dhoni's ability to test a player's abilities is unmatched
 rohit ne kaha, ‚Äòengland main champions trophy ne meraa bharosa badhaayaa ki main pari kii shuruyaat kar saktaa hum or main subah england ke halaat main safed gend se khilne kii chunauti kaa saamana karne ko taiyaar tha
 Rohit suffered a thigh muscle injury during the ODI series against New Zealand and he is still recovering from it
 unhone kaha, ‚Äòaap ise lekar kuch nahin kar sakate or maine pehle bhi is tarah kii sthitiyon kaa saamana kiya he
 What is disappointing to me is that the injury happened when i was in a rhythm after scoring three consecutive half-centuries in Test matches against New Zealand

 Pakistan Army Chief Rahil Sharif has once made a provocative statement about Kashmir
 kaha ki kashmir hamaari gardan kii nas he or isaki azaadi kii ladaai ke liye ham har str par kootnithik or naitik samarthan dete rahenge
 Rahil Sharif said these things in his speech on 6 September on the occasion of Pakistan Defense Day
 raahil shareef ne kaha ki makabooza kashmir ke awam kii qurbaaniyon ko ham salaam karte hai
 The people of Kashmir are fighting for their rights, but they have to fall prey to government terror

 nitish sarkaar dwaara bihar main sharabbandi ke baad ab bijepi kii sarkarein bhi is disha main kadam badhaane lagi hai
 Yesterday, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan announced that he would close liquor shops in the state one by one, so today Chief Minister Raman Singh of Chhattisgarh has also announced liquor ban in the state
 khaas baat ye he ki raman singh ne ye elaan apni bihar yatra ke dauraan hi kiya
 Significantly, in Bihar, the Nitish Kumar government has imposed complete prohibition
 gujarat ke baad aisa karne vaala bihar doosraa rajya ban gaya he
 Nitish has been saying from the beginning that liquor ban in any state can be completely successful only if it is stopped in the whole country
 lagata he ki nitish kii apil rang dikhaane lagi he
 On Monday, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh said that liquor ban will be implemented in a phased manner in the state
 namaami devi narmade- narmada seva yatra ke tahat narsinghpur jile ke nimkheda ilaake main ek program ke dauraan unhone kaha- pehle charan main rajya sarkaar narmada nadi ke kinare paanch kilometre tak sabhi sharaab kii dukaane band karaayegi
 After this, liquor will be banned in residential areas in the next phase
 khaskar un ilaakon se jahaan shaikshik santhaan or dharmik sthaan hai, unke aasapaas kii dukaane band karai jaaengi
 Today on the lines of Shivraj, Raman Singh also announced the implementation of liquor ban in Chhattisgarh in a phased manner
 raman singh do din kii apni nijee yatra par bihar main hai or aaj subah hi unhone patna main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar se mulaakaat kii thi
 After the meeting, in Munger, Raman Singh said that liquor ban will be done in villages where the population is 3 thousand or more
 unhone kaha ki main chhattisgarh main sharaab bandi lagu karuunga or rajya ab is disha main aage badhegaa
 Raman Singh visited Swami Niranjananand Saraswati's ashram in Munger to meet him
 pradhanmantri narendra modi karnataka main lagaataar chunavi reliyon ko sambodhit kar rahe hai
 a large crowd is gathering in his public meetings and road shows
 lekin raichur kii raily main piem modi kaa saamana apane ek aise fain se ho gaya jisane apane puure badan par modi kaa tatu banavaa rakhaa tha
 During the rally, PM Modi noticed this person standing in the crowd, he stopped his speech in the middle and instructed his fan to wear a shirt
 piem modi ne kaha, 'aapke pyaar ke liye abhaari hum, aapane puure sharir ko aise kar diya he lekin main prarthana karata hum ki sabha main dhyaan dijie or shart pahan lijie
 He said that there will be a prayer to the youth that do not give so much trouble to their bodies
 piem modi kii apil ke baad bheed main khadey shaks ne tunrat shart pehali lee
 Meanwhile, the people present at the rally got excited and started shouting slogans loudly
 raily ke baad tatu banavaane vaale basavaraj ne bataaya ki usne 15 ghante kii mehnat ke baad piem modi kaa tatu apane badan par banwaaya he
 Raichur: Took 15 hours to get this done
 i got it made as PM has done good work in 4 years
 He mentioned me in his rally today & said that i should help BJP win elections in the state

 video yahaan dekhen:congress par karaara hamalapiem modi ne jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki desh ke har kone se congress chali gai, karnataka se bhi inkaa safaya hona chahie
 Now no one can save Karnataka
 unhone kaha ki congress kaa nayaa mantra he- jhooth bolo, jahaan bol sakate ho, jitna bol sakate ho jhooth bolo
 This is his campaign
 sansad main gatirodh kaa aarope lagaate hue piem ne kaha kicongress sansad ko chalane nahin detii
 They are afraid that Modi is going to work one after the other, winning the trust of the people of the country
 unhone kaha ki congress ne obisi kamishan ko sanvaidhanik adhikaar dene ke liye koi kaam nahin kiya, hamane kiya
 The anti-congress of Dalit, OBC, Adivasi did not allow it to be passed in the Rajya Sabha
 bihar kemukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhiki style bhale hi filmi ho, par tareekabilkul chanakya jaisaahe
 Manjhi is seen acting as the character of the film protagonist, and like Chanakya is patting every step
 maanjhi kaa maksadabhi film nayak ke kirdaar jaisaa he yaa nahin? ye kahana mushkil hoga
 Nitish Kumar, who promoted himself as Chanakya of Bihar, came at a time in his political life when he felt himself trapped in the lurch
 tab unhen ek 'maanjhi' kii jarurat thi jise patavaar thamakar wo tab tak brake le saken jab tak log loksabhaa chunaavon main unki karaari haar kii baat bhula den
 That's when he heard the name of Jeetan Ram Manjhi
 nitish ne sochaa to yahi hoga ki 'maanjhi', unke khadaauun ke sahare shashan chalaayenge, lekin sochaa hua hota kab he?19 may, 2014 ko istipha dekar nitish kumaar ne maanjhi ko apana uttaradhikari ghoshit kiya to kaha gaya ki ab vah remote control se sarkaar chalaayenge
 Nitish kept the remote with him, but forgot to change the battery
 puraani bydaree bhala kitna din chalati or ab to bydaree tabhi badalati jab mukhyamantri uski ijaajat detaa
 By the time Nitish understood this, it was too late
 yaa kahen ki baaji haath se takreeban nikal chuki thi
 It is not even in the break that Nitish left for the Char Dham Yatra by handing over the chair to Manjhi
 nitish niyamit taur par vidhayakon se milte rahe
 To stay connected with people, he also kept visiting somewhere
 udhar, maanjhi chupchaap kaamkaaj kii baarikiyon ko samajhate rahe
 He had an old experience of politics, he had got freedom to work just like this for the first time
 bihar main jatigat raajnneeti kii kitni ahmiyat he ye maanjhi ko acchhee tarah pataa tha
 Manjhi knew that the Mahadalit agenda on which Nitish strengthened his political grip in Bihar also comes from the same section
 shaayad tabhi unhone samaj liya ki bandook chalaane ke liye kandhaa dene se to acha he ki khud hi bandook tham lo
 Not only did Manjhi have a chair and a pen, he also grabbed a gun equipped with Mahadalit formulas from Nitish's hand
 iske baad vah chun chun kar shikaar karte chale gaye
 The Mahadalit chief minister was probably waiting for the iron to heat up
 jaise hi mauka mila ek raajnneetik chaal chali
 Manjhi announced that he wanted to retire in a packed meeting
 bas ek aakhri raajnneetik khwaahish he ‚Äì aglaa mukhyamantri koi mahadalit hi bane
 This arrow also hit the target
 maanjhi mahadaliton ke asli maseehaa ban kar ubharne lage
 On the bureaucracy, the scribe targeted Nitish Kumar's most loved officer whom neither the leader nor his fellow officers liked
 agar wo kisi ko pasand the to bas nitish ke jiske paas remote to tha lekin bydaree discharge ho chuki thi
 Manjhi drove the officer cheaply
 maanjhi ne kuch or afasaron par bhi nigaraanee baitha di
 For this, they deployed their trusted officers from place to place
 maanjhi ko pataa tha ki bihar main agar sabase zyada kisi par bharosa kiya ja saktaa he to wo he apni birdari
 He chose such officers and elected them to important positions
 ab target par mantriafasaron ke baad maanjhi ne apni sarkaar ke kuch aise mantriyon ko bhi short-list kiya jinhen nitish kaa aadmi samajha jaataa he
 Manjhi sees Lallan Singh, PK Shahi, Shyam Rajak and Shravan Kumar working with him but seems to be closer to Nitish
 mana ja rahaa he ki afasaron kii tarah maanjhi aise mantriyon ko bhi baahar kaa rasta dikhaane kii koshish main hai
 Tell me, who is the leader? Like Manjhi, his supporters are also rebel
 maanjhi ke badhate kad ko dekhte hue vidhayakon ne bhi bayaanbaji shuru kar di he
 Citing the constitutional process, they are saying how the party president or anyone else besides the chief minister can call a meeting of the legislature party
 nitish samarthakon kaa apana tark he
 He says that Manjhi himself is the leader elected by the mlas
 unhen to nitish kumaar ne manonith kiya or wo mukhyamantri ban gaye
 Then with which mouth are they saying such things
 brake ke baad kii baithkembihar main baithkon kaa daur jari he
 So many meetings together are happening for the first time after Nitish took a break from power
 maanjhi apane samarthakon ke saath, to nitish apane samarthakon ke saath ranneeti taiyaar kar rahe hai
 JDU president Sharad Yadav has support with Nitish while his political partner Lalu Prasad has also given the green signal
 haalanki, parde ke peeche wo maanjhi ke paksh main hawa bhi bana rahe hai, aisi charchaa he
 Samajwadi Party President Mulayam Singh Yadav has also called and advised Nitish to take the chair, while Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan, who has joined hands with BJP, is trying to raise the voice of Manjhi
 discharge ho chuki bydareevala remote liye nitish kumaar samaj nahin paa rahe hai ki ab apane bhasmasur se nipten to aakhir kaise?kabhi kabhi lag rahaa he ki ye sari gatividhiyaan patna main nahin balki gokuldham socity main chal rahi hai

 Recently Samsung launched the flagship smartphones Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 +
 in smartfones ke launch se pehle ye khabar thi ki company Galaxy S8+ ko dual camera seoup ke saath utaar sakati he
 But this did not happen
 ab jab donon smartfones launch ho chuke hai or 21 april se cell ke liye aane vaali hai, tab khabar aa rahi he ki samsung Galaxy S8+ main dual camera seoup ke liye testing kar rahi he
 These are the most special features and specifications of Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus
 a photo with a dual camera setup of Samsung Galaxy S8 + has been seen on the Chinese microblogging website Weibo
 mana ja rahaa he ki ye launch se pehle kaa shuruaati prototip he
 In this picture, two cameras are seen inside the module like a capsule, a sensor and a flash are also visible below it
 khabar he ki Galaxy S8+ ke is prototip kaa model number bhi Galaxy S8+ ke model number se miltaa he
 That being said SMG955F
 saath hi rochak baat ye he ki iske back main fingerprint bhi najar nahin aa rahaa he, aise main agar company kabhi is prototip ko launch karti he to isamen fingerprint sensor disple main diya ja saktaa he
 Samsung's new Galaxy S8 can do what even the iphone cannot, but it is also important to mention that big smartphone companies like Samsung make a design final only after testing many prototypes
 baharhaal tasviir ko dekhakar iske launch ke bare main kuch bhi kahana jaldbaaji hi hogi
 Even if Samsung launches, then before that the company will definitely wait for the launch of iphone 8

 raat 8 baje
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing the country said that from twelve o'clock at night, 500 and thousand rupee notes will become pieces of paper, that is, there will be no legal tender
 is faisle ne puure desh main bhagdad kii sthiti bana di, har koi atm-bank ke aage ghanton line main khadaa rahaa
 Meanwhile, the government brought out a new pink note of 2000 rupees in the market, which was discussed and debated a lot
 ab thik 526 din baad ek baar phir sthiti kuch waisi hi he
 The pink note that came in is now on the verge of disappearing completely
 desh main cash ko lekar phir se haahaakaar machaa he
 atms, banks everywhere, people are wandering rate for cash
 atm khaali he or uski vajah se logon kii jeb bhi
 But what happened in these 526 days that the pink note of 2000 came and then its scarcity started
 or gaayab ho gaya gulabi note
 
 
 # On November 8, 2016, the demonetisation announcement was followed by the 2000 pink note
 # sarkaar ne arthvyavastha main majbootee kaa tark dete hue ye note jari kiye the
 But the large amount of notes that were issued in the market were not reaching back to the bank
 lagaataar in noton kii jamkhori kii khabaren aati raheen
 # That is why the government stopped the printing of 2000 notes since mid-2017 last year
 # aankadon ke mutabik is samay market main 6
 2000 notes worth 7 lakh crores are in circulation
 yah cirkulation main jari kul 18
 04 lakh crore is one-third of the notes
 ise padhein: kya modi sarkaar ke FRDI bill ke khauf se khaali ho rahe hai atm?ab kya kar rahi he sarkaar
 
 
 # The government has come into full action after complaining of cash shortage
 sarkaar kii taraf se koshish kii ja rahi he ki 100, 200 or 500 rupye ke note ko zyada se zyada chapa jaae
 # According to the government, 500 notes worth about 500 crore rupees were being printed earlier, but now efforts are being made to print up to 2500 crore rupees
 # sarkaar ne is tangi ke peeche tark diya he ki aamtaur par ek maheene main 20,000 karod rupee cash kii maang hoti he, lekin april ke pehle 13 dinon main hi 45,000 karod rupee nikaale gaye
 Demonetisation Part 2: Did the decision to stop printing 2000 notes go upside down? 8 per cent of atms empty, increased in these states According to the information, eight per cent of all atms across the country currently do not have cash
 is samay desh main kul atm ke 25 fisadi atm state bank of india ke paas hai or uske bhi 16 fisadi atm main paisa nahin he
 Maximum cash problems are coming in banks and atms in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Jharkhand, Gujarat and now it is being said that Delhi, Ghaziabad, Noida and Gurgaon may also be affected
 bhartiya janata party ke adhyaksh amit shah ne silvasa main apni sarkaar ke kaamon ko ginaya
 He also targeted the Congress fiercely
 unhone kaha ki centre sarkaar ne paanch saal main 129 yojanaayen shuru kin
 i have come in the public of Daman Diu by taking account of 129 schemes
 piem modi abhi bhi desh ke garib, dalit or pichhadon ke liye kaam kar rahe hai
 This is happening because the people of PM Modi's family have not been in the previous government
 shah ne kaha ki pichley 4
 In 5 years, the Modi government has worked in every region of the country
 desh kii suraksha ko sunishchit karne kaa kaam or desh kaa gaurav badhaane kaa kaam hamane kiya he
 The Congress governments ran in the country for years but they never worried about the health of the poor of the country, Modi government has given health protection to 50 crore people of the country
 unhone kaha ki desh kii suraksha ko sunishchit karne kaa kaam or desh kaa gaurav badhaane kaa kaam hamane kiya he
 For us, the protection of Mother India is the biggest priority, then for us it comes to win elections
 desh main ek ke baad ek ghotaalaa karne vaali congress party aaj ham par aarope laga rahi he, lekin desh kii janata sab jaanati he wo congress ke bahekaave main aane vaali nahin he
 Shah said, 'the Congress party committed scams of 12 lakh crores and that Congress is blaming Modi ji today
 kaan kholkar sun lo rahul ji aapke parivaar kaa to ghotaalon kaa itihaas rahaa he
 There is not a single stain on Modi ji's kurta and the people of the country have faith in him
 'unhone kaha, 'rafel saude main chavanni tak kaa ghotaalaa nahin he, congress party jhuthe aarope laga rahi he or kal desh kii raksha mantri ne desh kii sansad main congress ke sabhi aaropon ko jhootha bhi sabit kar diya he
 ' aam aadmi party ke aitihaasik jeet kii ore badhane ke bich bijepi ne kaha ki chunaav arvind kejariwal par raishumaari thi or ise centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ke pratibimb ke taur par nahin dekha janaa chahie
 BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao said that local issues were effective in the election
 yah puche jane par ki kya yah modi ke kaamkaaj par janamat sangrah tha, unhone kaha, main is rup main nahin dekhtaa
 He said, this election was a referendum on Arvind Kejriwal
 dilli ke logon ne ise is rup main dekha
 i think people definitely voted for Kejriwal

 The ruling Aam Aadmi Party of Delhi says that the work of mlas is not going on in the current pay and allowances and the issue should be discussed how an MLA should run his work in this

 or yah sthiti aise samay banane ja rahi he jab desh pehle se hi koi darjan bhar rajyon main naksalwad or kashmir main aatankwaad se jhulas rahaa he
 The importance of this small piece of land located in Faizabad district of Uttar Pradesh for both the Hindus and Muslims fighting this battle is that their religious sentiments are attached to it
 adaalat main or andolanon main hinduon kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahe vibhinn sanghathanon kaa daawa he ki yah bhagwaan ram kii janmasthali he jabaki musalamaanon kaa kahana he ki yah 16veen sadi kii babari masjid he, jiskaa nirmaan pratham mughal samraat babar ne karavaaya tha
 On July 26, the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court held three judges ‚Äî Justice S

 The sharma-key bench indicated that the hearing on both sides had been completed and a decision in the matter would be heard in September
 ayodhya vivaad kii visphotak prakruti ke maddenjar na sirf pratidwandvi sanghathan-musalamaanon kii taraf se babari masjid ection cameti or ol india muslim personal lau board or hinduon kii taraf se nirmohi akhaada or samoochaa sangh parivaar khaskar vishwa hindu parishad (vihip)-is faisle par pratikriya karne ke liye qamar kas rahe hai balki mukhyamantri mayawati ne bhi sarkari tantra ko puri tarah chaukas kar diya he
 Under this, the government holidays of police personnel have been canceled till further orders
 yahi nahin, vibhinn jilon main kanoon-vyavastha kii nigaraanee ke liye sarkaar ne varisht adhikariyon ko vishesh police adhikari banaakar tainaat kiya he
 The state government has also asked the Center to send some 500 companies of paramilitary forces to deal with the situation
 uttar pradesh kaa guptchar tantra sampradayik tatwon kii gatividhiyon kii nigaraanee karne ke liye din-raat ek kar rahaa he
 An Additional Director General of Police level admitted, "we have to be very vigilant before and during the High Court verdict and immediately get into action if anyone tries to create a communal problem
" ' is adhikari ke anusaar, varanasi or bareli samet rajya ke kareeb aadha darjan jilon main sampradayik sthiti bahut tanaavpurn ho gai he
 The most important thing is whether the losing party will follow the court's decision
 is par faijabad main ek chote-se praathmik vidhyalay main shikshak niraj mishra pratikriya jataate hai, 'supreme court ne jab shahbaano maamle main faisla diya tha to kya hua tha? tab kya musalamaanon ne tatkaaleen centre sarkaar par is faisle ko sansad ke jariye badalane kaa dabaav nahin daalaa tha?adaalat ne mandir ke viruddh faisla diya to hamen bhi yahi karnaa chahie
 'undoubtedly, the Ayodhya case may prove politically dynamite
 angrej bhi is mudde ko adaalat ke jariye sulajhane main naakaam rahe the or unhone yathasthiti banaae rakhane main hi bhalaai samajhi thi
 The same situation happened with the central and state government
 yahaan tak ki shankaracharya or muslim personal lau board yaa saiyad shahabuddin ke hastkshep karne par is maamle kaa koi shantipurna samaadhaan nahin nikal paaya
 The situation is grave because apparently it may be a matter of religious sentiments, but the reality is that both sides want to benefit from the matter to establish their political dominance
 donon pakshon ke puraane record ko dekhte hue yah sochna bhi morrkhtaa hogi ki ve adaalat ke adeshon kaa aksharshah paalan karenge
 During the last 20 years, some half-a-dozen Prime Ministers, religious heads and bureaucrats may have tried to settle the case, but they finally had to leave the case to court after burning fingers
 mukhya rup se aresas-vihip-bajrang dal kii aguai main hindu sanghathanon ne is silsile main jan abhiyaan shuru bhi kar diya he
 VHP spokesman Sharad Sharma says, 'hanuman Chalisa recitation has started in some seven lakh temples in the country
 ' iskaa pehla pradarshan 16 agast ko hua, jisamen na to bheed juty or na hi vah koi prabhaav chhod paaya
 This gives a glimpse of the declining credibility of the Sangh Parivar, including the BJP, in the Ayodhya case
 bhaajapa or uske aanushanbik sanghathan sadakon par hi nahin, kanoonee str par bhi adaalat main maamle ko puure josh-kharosh se ladane main asafal rahe hai
 He left such an important case, which proved to be lifesaving to bring the party to power for the first time in 1991, to the mere trust of a group of local lawyers

 In this case, some of the office bearers of the main plaintiff, Nirmohi Akhara, raised crores of rupees from the public in the name of construction of Ram temple on the Sangh Parivar
 dakaar jane kaa aarope lagaate hai
 The arena has been fighting in this case since 1885
 bhaajapa 6 disambar, 1992 ko ayodhya main vivaadit dhaancha giraae jane ke baad se is maamle se dur rahane kaa prayaas karti ai he
 Even during the elections, he kept the Ayodhya case in abeyance, which disappointed his staunch Hindu supporters
 bhaajapa or sangh parivaar ke mood kii jhalak shriram janmabhumi nyaas kii viraan padi kaaryshaala se milti he, jahaan is samay 'paise ke abhaav' kii vajah se kaam rukaa padaa he
 It was more than three years when the construction of pillars for the proposed temple of Lord Rama began here
 is sambandh main abhi mushkil se 65 pratishat hi kaam puraa ho paaya he
 Rama devotees who have gathered from all over the country have also stopped visiting here
 jo ikkaa-dukka log yahaan aate bhi hai, ve un hindu sanghathanon ke haathon 'thage' mahasoos karte hai, jinhone ayodhya main bhavy ram mandir kaa nirmaan karne ke to bade-bade vaade kiye the, lekin centre main sattarudh hone ke baad unhen nibhaa nahin paae the
 Mushtaq Siddiqui, who is contesting the case on behalf of Hashim Ansari, the main complainant of the ownership claim at the Ayodhya site, claims that from 1885 to 1941, the Nirmohi Arena has been in writing admitting that the structure at the said site is of the Babri Masjid and has He has no problem
 unke anusaar, 'san 1949 main aakar ayodhya maamle ko ek baar phir hawa di gai, jab bhagwaan ram kii murtiyon ko chori-chhipe dhang se us dhaanche ke bheetar rakh diya gaya
 Ansari, who has been fighting this case for more than 60 years, is now 90 years old and lives almost alone in his house
 thodaa ruk-rukkar ve kehete hai, 'meri jindagi kii aakhri khwaahish ab usee jagah par masjid bani dekhne kii he, jahaan use dhahaaya gaya tha or isse yah sabit ho jayega ki bharat dharmanirpeksh desh he

 Not only the Sangh Parivar, Muslim organizations and the Mayawati government are preparing for the final battle, but the residents of the temple town of Ayodhya are apprehensive about the days of September when the court will give its final verdict
 ayodhya main tainaat ek varisht police adhikari kaa kahana he, 'yah sahi he ki jo paksh bhi haar jayega, vah hycourt ke aadesh par sthaganadesh paane ke liye supreme court kaa dwaar khatkhataayega, lekin is faisle se jeetne vaale paksh ke manobal main jarur vruddhi ho jaaegi
 i do not, however, dismiss the victorious side's sentiments and celebrations on the streets, as well as the recurrence of the dreaded days of the early 90s
 ' is maamle ke chalate ayodhya gat puure 60 saal se trast he
 In the 90s there were riots and people lost their families in valuable property apart from losing their families in the winter
 or unke liye yah yantranaa shaayad abhi bhi khatm na ho
 But Hashmi does not agree with this
 unka kahana he, 'ayodhya dharmanirpeksh nagari he, jahaan sampradayik sadbhaav logon ke maanas main gahare paith chukaa he
 i have been fighting a case against the followers of Ram Janmabhoomi for the last 60 years, now i am 90 years old and i live alone in my house, but no Hindu has hit me with a stone
 rajnatik netaaon or sampradayik tatwon ko agar ham paas na fatakane den to ayodhya ko kuch nahin hoga

 On April 8, i had decided to release my disagreements on the consultation paper on the Net Neutrality (consultation Paper) of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on Twitter
 regulatting over da top services naam ke 118 panne ke dastavej ko padhgaye ke baad yah spasht ho gaya tha ki ek baar phir internet or uske karodon upabhoktaaon ke liye khatarnaak chunauti paidaa hone ja rahi thi
 i tweeted that consumers should be part of this consultation process and give their feedback so that their voice can be heard
 sirf ek hafte baad bhartiya internet upabhokta ne apni takat kaa sahi pradarshan kar daalaa he‚Äîsoshal media or mukhyadhara kaa media bhi net neutrelity ke samarthan main khulkar saamne aa chukaa he or usne is masale par tri ke nazariye par sawaal khadey kar die hai
 Net neutrality is the basic principle that ensures that all online content is available to the consumer on equal terms
 takneekee taur par kahen to iskaa matlab yah hua ki sabhi data packeton ke saath samaan bartaav ho
 This element makes the Internet a free and mutually collaborative space as it is today
 aisa manch jo upabhoktaaon ko apni pasand kii saamagree ko mukt tareeke se chunane kii takat detaa he, sivaae uske jo kanuunan varjit ho
 This strength has made the application and services successful, which have changed the consumer experience world
 haal hi main jab bharat kii sabase badi doorsanchaar seva pradaata company airtel ne kuch vishisht eps ke liye atirikt shulk lagane kaa prayaas kiya tha to is maamle main tri kii chuppi pakadi gai thi
 The move was withdrawn after consumer outrage
 isaki vajah se mujhe tri ko likhane ko baadhya hona padaa tha jisamen maine usase aagrah kiya tha ki ve bazaar kii takat ke is durupyog main apana hastkshep karen
 This consultation process is late, but the result is the same
 net neutrelity par bahes koi darshanik kism kii nahin he
 Like section 66A of the IT law, it also deals with the basic soul of the free and constantly growing Internet
 dhara 66e ke maamle main jahaan kuchhek netaa abhivyakti ko baadhit karnaa chaahate the, to taaja maamle main kuch telecom companiyaan hai jo internet kii gatiki or aarthiki ko niyantrit karnaa chaah rahi hai
 If these companies are arbitrary, then consumers will have to pay a separate fee for opening apps like whatsapp, Viber in addition to regular data charges
 doorsanchaar companiyaan iske peeche jo vajah ginava rahi hai, unamem duusari companiyon ke apane plateform par ho rahe nawacharon se lekar suraksha kaaran shaamil hai jo unki kamai par asar daalenge
 For this reason, they want a regulatory framework for OTT (over the top content) to be prepared so that companies can recover money for these apps
 isamen do raay nahin ki sirf phone kol se companiyon ko aane vaale rajasav par tike doorsanchaar kaarobaari model par khatra mandara rahaa he, lekin yah bhi sweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki doorsanchaar companiyon ko data-kendrit companiyon or kaarobaari modelon main roopantarit karne kaa aarthik boj upabhokta ke kandhe par daal diya jaae
 The strange thing is that while many investors understand that the innovations and changes in technology are affecting the whole scenario, people sitting in the TRAI do not even know this
 tri kii siforishein net neutrelity ke siddhanton kaa ulanghan hai
 It aims to create a mechanism where telecom companies will gain the strength to leverage their tariffs on consumers' access to specific services and apps
 upabhoktaaon ke hit kii baat karen to tri kaa koi bahut gauravmay ateet dikhaai nahin detaa chunki usee ke raaj main doorsanchaar pradaataaon kii sevaaon ke str main giravat ai he
 This step also seems to be tilted towards the telecom companies, which can be given many examples
 masalan, skypi jaisi otiti sevaaon ke failaav se doorsanchaar operataron kii kamai par padane vaale "pratikul prabhaavon" par vistrut talikaayen di gai hai
 Publicly available information says that telecom operators are still reaping huge profits, so these tables are nothing more than white lies
 tri ne jo sawaal uthaae hai unamem bhi kuchhek uske pakshpatpurna ravaiye ke prati dharna ko or pusht karte hai, jaise "vyaavhaarik nazariye ke hisaab se koun-se bhedbhaav tarksangat hai?" yah poochne kaa aashay banataa he ki vyaavhaarikta ke naam par kitni gaiyr-kanoonee gatividhi kii anumati he
 There are many examples which further reduce the trust of consumers in the reduced TRAI and telecom companies
 is baar haalanki logon ne jo cheekh-pukaar machaai he, vah ek aise desh main upabhokta takat kii apratyaashit misaal he jahaan upabhokta adhikaron ko hameshaa haashiye par rakhaa gaya he
 There is much to learn from the regulatory body and private companies in this incident
 net nirpekshata par bharat kaa jo bhi aadhikarik paksh tay hoga, vah aagaamee dashakon main bharat kii praudyogikeey chhap ke lihaaj se nirnaayak sabit hoga
 trai's recommendations will reach the government after 24 April
 is baat ke sakshya hai ki sarkaar kaa najariya tri ke samaan nahin rahegaa
 The government will have to take a decisive decision
 doorsanchaar ke kshetra main nivesh or niveshak ahm hai, lekin centre main to upabhoktaaon ko hi rakhana hoga kyonki internet ke bhavishya par kisi bhi bahes main sabase bade hitdharak ve hi hai
 a handful of private companies cannot set the rules for important things like the Internet
 (lekhak rajyasabha saansad or praudyogiki udhyami hai) The crisis is intensifying for the Chinese tech company Huawei
 america trump sarkaar ke aadesh ke baad google ne huaave ke smartphone se Android kaa license cancil kar diya he
 Not only this, Microsoft has removed Huawei laptops from its stores
 taaja khabar ye he ki britain main vodaphone na Huawei ke 5G smartfones ke liye pre booking ko bhi suspend kar diya he
 The matter is not over here
 royatres kii ek report ke mutabik britain kii chip mekar ARM ne bhi chini company huaave ke saath apana bijness suspend karne kii taiyaari kar lee he
 This is being done by following American regulations
 aapako bataa den ki ARM duniya kii sabase badi chip diziners main se he
 According to a Bloomberg report, the world's major chipset companies such as chip makers Intel, Qualcomm and Broadcom have told their employees that they will not supply anything to Huawei until further notice
 shuukravaar ko america trump sarkaar ne huaave ko blaclist karne kaa aadesh diya he
 It has been alleged that this Chinese company is acting as a spy of the Chinese government and is spying for the Chinese Government
 aapako bataa den ki is samay huaave duniya kii duusari sabase badi smartphone company ban gai he
 But now the company has many problems after being sidelined by Google and chipset companies
 ab company ko apane smartphone main dene ke liye bana android vaala mobile oparating system taiyaar karnaa hoga
 Apart from smartphones, Huawei may also suffer major losses in 5G deployment
 kyonki 5G ke liye company ne bade paimaane par taiyaari kii he or zyaadaatar 5G ke zyada equipments america companiyaan hi supplai karti hai
 Overall, the issue for now is that millions of crores of users will be in trouble
 google ke eps nahin chalenge or android kaa saport bhi band hone kii sambhaavna he
 Although security updates will continue to be received, Google has made this clear
 lekin google eps kaa saport na milanaa kisi android smartphone ke liye badi baat hogi

 In a spot-fixing case, a London court sentenced three Pakistani cricketers Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Aamir to bookie Mazhar Majeed
 salmaan bat ko 30 maheene, mohammad asif ko 12 maheene or mohammad aamir ko 6 maheene kaid kii sajaa sunai he jabaki buki mazhar majid ko 2 saal 8 maheene kaid kii sajaa sunai he
 In a hearing that lasted almost three weeks, Justice Jeremy Cook, sentencing the players' agent Mazhar Majeed, was sent to jail for two years and eight months
 cook ne sajaa paane vaale chaaron logon se kaha, ‚Äòriayat kii apil ke baavjood ye aparaadh itane gambhir hai ki jail kii sajaa hi upyukt hogi
 Butt, who corrupted his comrades, has been called the 'mastermind' of this entire scam
 is prakaran kaa khulaasa ab band ho chuke teblide ‚Äònews aaf da world‚Äô ne pichley saal agast main ek sting opareshaan ke jariye kiya tha
 The judge said, 'it is clear that you are the architect of these cases
 aapako yah sunishchit karnaa tha ki ye donon gendbaaj fiks samay ke mutabik gendbaaji karen
 'cook told Asif,' No money was received from you but it is clear that you conspired to throw Noble
 ‚Äô bat or asif ko mangalvaar ko juri ne dhokhadhadi kii sajeesh rachane or galat tareeke se paisa sweekaar karne kaa shadyantr rachane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Majeed and Aamir admitted their guilt before the hearing in September
 in cricketron ko haalanki apni sajaa kaa keval aadha samay jail main bitaana pad saktaa he kyonki acha bartaav hone par inhen license par reeha kiya ja saktaa he
 These three cricketers have also been asked to pay the expenses incurred in the case
 bat ko 30937 pound jabaki asif or aamir ko kramash: 8120 or 9389 pound dene ko kaha gaya he
 Judge Cook said, 'now when people will see surprising things in the match or a surprising result will come or sometime in the future, the fans of the game who spend the match will spend some money wondering if this match is fixed
 Or what they saw was natural
 ‚Äô ye teenon cricketer jab adaalat pahunche to mediakarmiyon or aam aadamiyon ke bich kamare main jagah paane ke liye khinchataan bhi hui
 The entire episode of spot-fixing began in August last year when shocking footage surfaced in which Majeed was claiming that he could fix a test match for $ 1 million
 usne daawa kiya kiya bat, asif or aamir uske liye kaam karte hai or usne khulaasa kiya ki kaise teen teenon ne sajeesh ke tahat england ke khilaaf lords test ke dauraan jaanboojhkar nobal phenki
 The police raided the hotel rooms of the cricketers after the sting operation and recovered cash which they both could not give any clear answer
 isisi ne iske baad anushaasanamak karrwai karte hue bat ko 10 saal (paanch saal nilambit), asif ko saat saal (do saal nilambit) or aamir ko paanch saal ke liye pratibandhit kar diya
 In the earlier match-fixing cases, eminent cricketers like Hansi Cronje, Salim Malik and Mohammad Azharuddin were found guilty by various judicial commissions but none of the cricketers have been convicted so far

 During the sentencing, prosecuting lawyer Aftab Jafarzi QC said that Butt and Asif, motivated by greed, 'corrupted' a match which was watched by millions and 'betrayed' their team, Pakistan Cricket Board and the game
 Bigg Boss 12 Grand Finale big bos 12 kii trophy bhai-bahan kii jodi main se deepika kakkad ibrahim ne jeet lee he
 Sreesanth was the first runner up
 soshal media trends or phens ke saport ko dekhte hue sabhi ko laga tha ki sijan 12 kii trophy srisanth hi jeetenge
 But in the end he lost to tv's daughter-in-law Deepika Kakkar Ibrahim
 tisare number par bihar ke contestant deepak thakur rahe
 He left the game with a briefcase at the last minute during the final
 jeet ke prabal daavedaar maane ja rahe srisanth kii haar se unke phens behad niraash hai
 After coming so close to the trophy, why did Sreesanth miss out on becoming a winner? Let's know 5 reasons
 # 1
 The fan following of the TV actress, The Mathasreesanth is an international cricketer
 yangsters or cricket lovers ke bich unki jabadast popularity he
 But in the case of Fandom, he lagged behind Deepika
 sasuraal simer kaa se ghar-ghar main popular huin deepika ne darshakon ke dilon main khaas pahchaan banaai thi
 Which benefited him in Big Boss
 # 2
 Gratitude on the migration Heavydeepikki Bigg Boss Journey was decent and gracious to all the contestants till date
 salmaan khan ne unhen sijan 12 kii sabase Dignified ladi bhi kaha tha
 Deepika never abused herself during the 105-day journey, did not use profanity
 bina matlab ke mudde nahin banaae or kabhi aapa nahin khoyaa
 Deepika's calm and gracious behavior impressed the TV audience
 vahiin srisanth hameshaa galat bhashaa or agreshan hi dikhaate najar aae

 The biggest reason behind becoming a TV daughter-in-law is Deepika Pipika Kebig as the bosswinner, being her popular face in the Hindi region
 tivi kii popular bahu kaa kirdaar nibhaane kii vajah se unhen sho main phayda mila
 Sreesanth is no less popular, but due to his distance from the cricket field and low popularity in the Hindi region, he got support from limited people
 deepika ko tivi world ke celebs ne bharpoor pyaar diya

 Sreesanth did not participate in many tasks
 tamaam maukon par unhen dekhakar lagata tha ki wo logon se cat rahe hai
 The second thing is that Sreesanth's celebrity attitude towards common contestants also went against him

 There has been a political uproar in India since the French President Fran√ßois Hollande's statement about the Rafale deal
 is masale ko lekar pehlecongressdhyaksh rahul gandhi ne piem modi or anil ambani par tikhaa hamalaa bolaa, jiske jawaab main sarkaar kii ore se kendriya kanoon mantriravishankar prasadko maidan main utaara gaya
 During this, he hit back at Rahul Gandhi and accused him of helping Pakistan by making the information of Rafael public
 iske baad congress ne phir palatwaar kiya or congress kii ore serandeep surajevalane morcha sambhala
 Reversing Ravi Shankar's statement, Surjewala said, "PM Modi is silent on Rahul Gandhi's questions about Rafael, but the Ministry of Defense and Law Minister are making statements
" kanoon mantri gaiyr kanoonee baat kar rahe hai
 They are immersed in ego
 vaharilianceke vakil rah chuke hai
 In this case, the defense minister is also not coming forward
 ' is dauraan unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi, rakshaamantri nirmala sitaraman or ravishankar prasad korafel dilke dastavej saarvajanik karne kii chunauti di
 The Congress leader said, "we had no secret agreement with France
 kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad or rakshaamantri nirmala sitaraman jhooth bol rahe hai
 BJP should stop counting false flaws
 'unhone kaha, 'kanoon mantri or raksha mantralay ne kaha ki 30 hajaar karod rupee kaa theka anil ambani kii company ko dilaane main bharat sarkaar kaa koi role nahin tha
 The reality, however, is that the chief servants were not serving the country, but Ambani
 rafel deal kaa samjhauta karne vaale france ke tatkaaleen raashtrapati oland ne saaf taur par kaha ki 36 rafel kharidne kii shart yah tha ki 30 hajaar karod kaa theka echeel se chhinakar reliance samooh ko diya jayega
 The Congress leader said, "it is also true that the Kirafel Deal was held between President Hollande and Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi
 is deal par jab oland kaa bayaan saamne aayaa, to france kii sarkaar, bharat sarkaar or piem modi main se kisi ne isko galat tehraaya
 It is clear that Hollande is true
 unke bayaan ko koi chunauti nahin de paaya
 Even the Law Minister could not cut his statement
 'isse pehle rahul gandhi ke bayaan par palatwaar karte hue kendriya kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki congress adhyaksh rafel kii sabhi jaankariyon ko saarvajanik karwaakar pakistan kii madad karnaa chaahate hai
 Prasad said, 'rahul Gandhi has called Prime Minister Modi a thief, a popular leader of the country and a symbol of honesty
 aaazaad bharat main aaj tak kisi party ke rashtriya adhyaksh ne aise shabdon kaa prayog kisi pradhanmantri ke liye nahin kiya he
 Rahul Gandhi has become Congress President without any merit and ability only because he comes from Gandhi family
 lihaaja unase koi or ummid kii bhi nahin ja sakati he
 Reversing Rahul Gandhi, Ravi Shankar Prasad said, 'the person who is out on the vine with his mother in the corruption, plunder of land and share, who is silent on the looting of land by his brother-in-law and whose whole family took bribe in Bofors No, the country cannot expect anything from him
 congress party bhrashtachar kii janani he
 Targeting the Congress president, Ravishankar Prasad said, "they are saying that tell the price of Rafael, so that the enemy becomes alert
" wo rafel kii sabhi jaankaree saarvajanik karwaakar pakistan kii madad karnaa chaahate hai
 Rahul Gandhi is playing in the hands of India's enemies by insisting on making information about all weapon systems public

 The fact is that till the first fortnight of August, there have been 20 incidents of extremely heavy rain (ie more than 244 mm in 24 hours) and 100 incidents of heavy rain (ie 124-244 mm rain) in the country

 Mahesh Rawat, vice-president of weather forecasting agency Skymet, says, "the normal monsoon pattern has deviated for the last 6-7 years
 ab kam dabaav kaa kshetra bengal kii khadi ke madhyavarti ilaake main banane laga he
 Due to this, its normal route has shifted slightly to the south in central India i

 southern part of Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Vidarbha, southern Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan
 ''ravat kii baat kii pushti karata he pune ke savitribai phule vishvavidhyalay kaa 2014 main aayaa ek adhyayan, jisamen deshbhar ke 1951 kebaad se barish ke pattern main badlaav kii taraf ishaara kiya gaya he
 According to this, there is a regional irregularity in the amount of rain during the monsoon season and the incidence of torrential rains has increased in Gujarat and western India including Kutch
 adhik shaharikaran vaale ilaakon main aisa adhik ho rahaa he
 For instance, Mount Abu, Rajasthan received 50 per cent of the rainy season in just three days and the rainfall figure reached 1,715 mm
 mahesh ravat kehete hai, ''is baar do lagaataar kam dabaav ke kshetra bengal kii khadi main ban gaye
 He reached Gujarat directly through the new route and got moisture from the Arabian Sea as well, Badal stayed there for several days due to the formation of deep depression on Gujarat
 isse baari or bahut baari barish hui
 Rawat says that as the first cloud weakened, the second low-pressure cloud also came in and the cloudy rain continued for ten consecutive days due to this seasonal event
 natijatan gujarat or pashchimi rajasthan main ausat se kaaphi zyada barsaat se baari baadh aa gai
 In fact, it was the peculiar behavior of the monsoon, because if the low pressure that normally forms in the Bay of Bengal is formed in the inner ocean, then cyclones usually turn towards Odisha, Bengal or Myanmar
 is baar donon chakravaat pashchim kaa rukh kar gaye or gujarat or rajasthan ke aasmaan main jaakar atak gaye
 After this, the monsoon changed momentum and moved northwards and spread from the Himalayan foothills, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand to Assam and Arunachal
 aisi mausami paristhiti kaa dakshini hissaa sookhaa rahata he jise brake monsoon paristhiti kehete hai
 This time too, due to this break, there was no rain in northwest India for several days
 udhar, monsoon tarai ilaakon main joardaar barish se nagaland, mizoram, manipur or tripura kii barsaat assam main baadh kii vajah ban gai
 Dr
 charan singh bataate hai ki in chaar chote rajyon main ausat barsaat hoti he lekin is baar tej barish to hui hi, china se aa rahi brahmaputra kaa paat bhi ufan rahaa tha
 There was a flood in Assam
 aapako yaad hoga, dedh dashak pehle tak barsaat dhimi or kai dinon tak hua karti thi, lekin ab musaladhar barish ke dinon kii ginati bad gai he
 The torrential rain in a few hours brings devastation
 mahesh ravat kehete hai, ''ab zyada barsaat thunder shower ke rup main yani garajane vaale badalon se hone lagi he
 The 890 mm monsoon that should be raining between 1 June and 30 September is getting more or less the same, but the days of rain have reduced
 isaki vajah jalwaayu main badlaav, hariyaali kii kami or pradooshan baduya he
 All these factors are affecting the monsoon
 ''monsoon ke mizaaj par ipicisi (jalwaayu parivartan par vibhinn deshon kii sarkaron kaa panel) kaa 2015 main kiya ek adhyayan is baat ko vistaar se bataata he
 According to this, the heat of a place increases the use of the land there and it affects the type of rain
 jameen ke istemaal kaa tarika or hawa main maujuud dhulkan or pradooshan (airosol) dharti se takaraakar lautne vaali garmi kii maatra (albido) ko bhi prabhavit karte hai
 The air becomes hotter due to the presence of more aerosols
 natijatan jo badal dur tak failane chahie ve garm hawa ke saath upar uthakar garajane vaale badalon main badal jate hai
 This causes more rainfall in one place
 ipicisi ke adhyayan main barish ke is badale pattern ko 5 se 15 fisadi tak bataaya gaya he
 These events have also started manipulating the dates of arrival of monsoon
 ravat jin garajane vaale badalon kaa zikr karte hai pehle ve monsoon se pehle march, april or may main uttar bharat main 'norwester' yaa bengal main 'kalbaisakhi' naam ke tufaanon ke saath aate the
 But now as soon as the air above the mainland in India is hot, and moisture is formed, thunder clouds become
 ye dharti kii sataha se kareeb 3 hajaar foot par hi hote hai leki na iskaa upree sira 50 hajaar foot tak chalaa jaataa he
 If there is speed in these clouds, it rains well within a radius of 100 kilometers, but if there is a terrain, the clouds cannot cover much distance and then it rains heavily in that area
 vaishvik adhyayanon se lekar mausam vaigyanik tak is baat par ek raay hai ki monsoon kaa yah asaamaanya mizaaj hi new normal he or hamen nae maahaul main dhalane kii koshish kerani chahie
 In flood-hit areas, as well as in cities like Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru or Chandigarh, the only way to prepare for the management of such a disaster more quickly and expeditiously

 However, the start of England's innings on the second day of the match was not very good and the Indian bowlers managed to tie the English batsmen in the first and second seasons of the day
 ek samay 113 par chaar wicket khokar dabaav main najar aa rahi mejabaan team ke liye gairi balance (110) or moin ali (32) ne paanchaven wicket ke liye 98 ran jode
 Indian bowling looked completely derailed after tea

 Score runs at an average of 03

 In such a situation, Murali Vijay revived Moin and revived the Indian team
 iske baad captain dhoni ne maukey kaa phayda uthaate hue 81wein over main nai gend lene kaa faisla kiya
 India got the benefit of this and Bhuvneshwar Kumar finally took the wicket of the balance, which proved to be a headache for the visiting team throughout the day

 In a rhyme, he said interestingly that the Congress leaf from Bihar will be cleared and Lalu will have to face defeat
 isamen koi andeh nahin he
 The senior BJP leader said that Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan have always been doing politics of casteism and religion, but this time people will make the NDA victorious in the name of development

 The BJP, which is trying to return to power for the fourth time in Madhya Pradesh, has made a series of promises to the public, but in the midst of all this, what has renewed memories of the Congress manifesto is the cow and the cow shed
 bijepi ne apane ghoshnaptr main gaushalaon kii sankhya badhaane or har sambhaag main gau-abhyaarany kholane kaa vaada kiya he
 However, it is different that Arun Jaitley, who came to release the bjp's manifesto, seems unaware of this and he himself admitted that some issues are not for the manifesto
 arun jetali se jab is babat sawaal poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki gaay kaa vishay menifesto se aage badhkar hota he
 Seeing their agenda in bjp's manifesto, Congress also jumped into the fray
 congress ne aarope lagaaya ki nae gau- abhyaarany kholane se pehle desh ke iklaute gau-abhyaarany kii sud le lete
 The Congress has described the bjp's vision as blind
 congress pradesh adhyaksh kamalnath ne twit kar bijepi ke ghoshnaptr ko jhootha qaraar diya
 Kamal Nath wrote that 'bjp's vision letter issued today is just cheating and cheating, nothing new but old announcements have been included again

 Let us tell you that last week Congress also promised to increase cow shed in its manifesto and the way it is now mentioned in the BJP manifesto, it seems that the issues related to people have now been replaced by cow, cow and religion

 Significantly, the CCS consists of four top ministers from the Department of Defense, Home, Foreign and Finance besides the PM
 yani shah inamen se koi ek mantri ban sakate hai
 Significantly, during Narendra Modi's stay in Gujarat, Amit Shah had been the Home Minister in his government
 isliye isaki bhi charchaa he ki amit shah ko centre sarkaar main grih mantri banaaya ja saktaa he
 But Rajnath Singh, who was the Home Minister in Modi's first government, has also won this time from Lucknow and is among the most senior leaders of the party

 He has held key portfolios in the past and this time too he may get an important ministry

 Controlling the fiscal deficit during the last five years has been a major challenge before the Central Government in the preparation of the Interim Budget
 kaarykaal ke shuruaati teen saal main modi sarkaar ne is jimmedaari ko bakhubi nibhaayaa
 After which it was expected that the government would get full numbers after handling the fiscal deficit in the five-year report card
 lekin sarkaar ne july 2017 main deshbhar main jiesti lagu karne kaa faisla liya or is faisle se safalataa kii disha main bad rahi sarkaar ko you-turn mil gaya
 According to India Today editor Anshuman Tiwari, when the Modi government took office in 2014, the country was engaged in the exercise of handling financial losses
 kendra sarkaar vaishvik or gharelu kaarnon se apane kaarykaal ke shuruyaat main is ghate par lagaam lagane vaali behad safal sarkaar banakar ubhar rahi thi
 But after the implementation of GST in July 2017, the biggest success of the Modi government's tenure turned towards its failure
 modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal kii 2014 main shuruuaat hone ke baad vaishvik bazaar main kachche tel kii keemton main tej giravat rahi
 This decline continued to provide relief to the central government till the middle of 2018 and due to this the savings in the import bill gave the government treasury the opportunity to balance its deficit

 BUDGET 2019: 5 years of Modi government, pass or fail in handling fiscal deficit? Anshuman Tiwari said that after GST was implemented in July, the government got a big setback in the revenue sector
 jahaan jiesti lagu karne ke liye sarkaar ko rajasav kaa ek bada hissaa rajyon ko saunpna padaa vahiin jiesti se ummid ke mutabik rajasav ekatra nahin hua
 In its early tenure, the Central Government made a provision for a recapitalization package to implement the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission due to the strong treasury and to improve the health of banks
 iske alaava kendra sarkaar ne kai rashtravyapee yojanaon samet kisaan karj maafee ke liye rajasav ke ek bade hisse ko kharch kiya
 Due to all these expenses, the situation of revenue deficit was reversed for the government and at the beginning of the tenure, the government which had achieved the revenue deficit target had reached its target

 buudhvaar ko adaalaton kaa twist ham sabane dekha
 First Sessions Court verdict
 
 Salman sentenced to five years
 phir kuch ghante baad bombai hoicourt kaa jamaanat kii shakl main salmaan ko raahat, par ye jamaanat ye raahat bas aaj raat bhar ke liye he
 On Friday, the court will give a verdict on Salman afresh
 aakhir kya-kya ho saktaa he shuukravaar ko adaalat main
 
 aaie aapako bataata hum
 During the Bombay High Court hearing on bail on Friday, Salman Khan is not required to stay in court
 ummid yahi he ki wo bandra ke apane isi gallexi apartment main baith kar dhadkate dilon se court ke faisle kaa intjaar karenge
 Now, if the news of relief comes from Bombay High Court, then Salman can sleep peacefully in this house of Bandra
 lekin kahin faisla khilaaf aayaa to buudhvaar kii tarah shuukravaar ko ek baar phir salmaan ko seshans court kaa rukh karnaa hoga
 They will have to surrender themselves by going there
 or phir seshans court se police hiraasat main unhen arthur road jail janaa hoga
 And in this way, on Friday, this place will be special for Salman
 ab sabase bada sawaal ye ki aakhir shuukravaar ko bombai hai court main kya hoga yaa kya-kya ho saktaa he? to ise samajhane ke liye pehle ye samaj lijie ki shuukravaar ko bombai hoicourt ne salmaan khan ko do din kii jo jamaanat di he wo antarim jamaanat he
 And this interim bail was granted because Salman was not found in the copy of the session court session
 darasal seshans court ke faisle ko hoicourt main chunauti dene yaa jamaanat paane ke liye jaruri he ki faisle kii copy aapke paas ho
 Now Salman's lawyer has got a copy of the verdict
 khud jaj deshpandey ne ye copy salmaan ke vakil ko di he
 So now in such a case three things can happen in the court on Friday
 pehali, hoicourt salmaan kii apil ko manjuur karte hue unki jamaanat kii miyaad badha kar cese kii sunwaayee kii agali koi taarikh de sakati he
 But this date will be after summer vacation
 adaalat main garmi kii chuttee 9 may se shuru ho rahi he or 7 june tak chuttee rahegi
 That is, in such a case there will be no hearing of the case till the first week of Firzoon
 duusari, court salmaan kii jamaanat kii apil ko khaarij kar de
 In such a case, Salman will have to surrender in the sessions court immediately after the verdict and then go to jail
 or teesri ye kisalmaan ke vakil adaalat main ye daleeldein ki faisle kii copy unhen der se mili he lihaaja unhen padhane kaa vakt diya jaae taaki wo cese dhang se taiyaar kar saken
 In such a case, if the court finds it, then it can extend the bail period by giving Salman the next date
 salmaan kii taraf se shuukravaar ko bhi bombai hoicourt main jane-maane vakil harish salve pairvi karenge
 According to sources, if the Bombay High Court on Friday rejects Salman's bail application, then a team of lawyers have prepared to go to the Supreme Court at the same time
 vaise ye bombai hoicourt hi he jisane 2003 main salmaan khan ko isi hit and ran cese main ek badi raahat di thi
 Reversing the judgment of the lower court, Salman's fate is to be decided once again in the same Bombay High Court after 12 years, removing the section of culpable homicide against Salman
 karnataka ke mukhyamantri bi es yediurppa ke baagi tewaron ke aage naram padate hue bhaajapa alaakaman unhen rajya main hone ja rahe panchayat chunaavon tak abhaydaan dene kaa man banaati nazar aa rahi he
 He fears that the party will not have to suffer huge losses in these elections if Yeddyurappa is removed
 bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa ne kaha, ‚Äòyediurppa ko had se had panchayat chunaav sampann hone tak samay diya ja saktaa he
 We have not reached any final decision yet
 karnataka ke gramin ilaakon main yediurppa kaa acha aadhaar he, jahaan lingayat matadaata unke samarthak hai
 Yeddyurappa's sons were asked by the party high command to resign after a case of irregularities in the allocation of precious urban land in the state had asked them to resign, but they have been avoiding it by adopting rebel tactics
 tuji spetrum or adarsh houseing sosayadi aadi ghotaalon kii sanyukt sansadeey samiti se jaanch karaane kaa sarkaar par dabaav banaae hue bhaajapa yediurppa ko hataane ko lekar pasopesh main he
 Not removing them weakens the siege being run against the government on corruption, and removal on the other hand may pose a risk of incurring losses in the upcoming panchayat elections in the state
 yediurppa lingayat samudaay ke hai jo karnataka ke matdaaon kaa 19 pratishat he
 Apart from this, saints of some religious sects of the state have also come out in support of him
 isse bhaajapa kaa kendriya netritv jaldbaaji karne se bachane kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 However, most of the bjp's top leadership believes that Yeddyurappa should be removed from the Chief Minister's post if the government is to maintain moral pressure in the matter of corruption
 duusari ore karnataka ke kuch bhaajapa saansadon ne aaj varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani or sushamaa swaraj se bhent kar yediurppa ko mukhyamantri banaae rakhane kaa aagrah kiya
 Advani is said to have told the mps that the right to take a final decision on Yeddyurappa has been delegated to BJP President Nitin Gadkari
 maamle ke samaadhan ke prayaas main arun jetali or em venkaiya naidu ne aaj subah yediurppa se baatcheet kii
 Yeddyurappa, who reached Delhi yesterday, is publicly adopting both 'soft-hot' stances
 party alaakaman ke nirnay ko maanane kii baat karne ke saath vah yah bhi kah rahe hai ki unhen 110 se 120 vidhayakon kaa samarthan praapt he
 He is also claiming that the high command has not asked him to resign and the central leadership has been silent on his claims
