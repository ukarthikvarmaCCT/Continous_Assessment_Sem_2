 dilli main beete hafte, is saal ke sarvaadhik dengue ke maamle saamne aae hai
 People fear about thirty new cases a week
 ek hafte ke bheetar itane maamle saamne aane par nagar nigam ne bhi turant baithak bulaai

 MCD is responsible for health services
 vahiin fund dene kaa kaam dilli sarkaar ko karnaa he lekin donon hi jhagade main vyast hai

 nigam kaa kahana he ki kejariwal sarkaar ne use ab tak fund nahin diya he jisaki vajah cedengue or malariaki rokthaam main lagane vaale karmchaariyon ko selary nahin di ja saki he
 That is, once again the common man is seen to be at a disadvantage in the tussle between the Delhi government and the MCD

 However, Aamir and the director of the film, Advaita Chandan, clearly understand that the film's politically symbolic references can be interpreted and they want to ensure that the film does not face any controversy

 The figure size is not determined for the model
 The model does not get any jobs
 The average figure size of Indian women is? In the modeling world there is more demand for girls with flexible waist, white skin tone and high height
 
 
 ye na jane kis kitaab main likhaa he
 But whether it is boy or girl, it is expected that their appearance should be the same as the fashion industry has decided
 yadi vah fishan industry ke banaae hue niyamon ke antagart aate hai to vah modelling kii duniya main pravesh kar sakate hai anyathaa nahin
 But have you ever wondered why even today, people of fat and plus size are not seen from the eyes of the model? Why does he feel uncomfortable in making a career in this field, what is the reason for this? About this, model Varshita Thatavarthi, who came on the platform of India Today mindrocks-2019, explained how girls are divided into categories that are obese or There are plus sizes
 bataa den, is seshan ko moderet saurabh dvivedi kar rahe the
 Varshita said that there are less opportunities in modeling for the plus size model i
e
 obese people in the market and the opportunities available are considered different from other models
 kya hai UK2, UK4, us0sho ko moderet kar rahe saurabh dvivedi ne varshita se sawaal karte hue poocha ki model ke UK2, UK4, US0 ke figure sies tay kiye jate hai to kya fishan diziner kapade kisi kuposhan ke marijon ke liye dizin karte hai
 Because the people of India are eating, drinking, healthy, healthy, healthy, then how did this change begin? Varshita said that figure sizes are fixed for the model
 unhone ek vaakya share karte hue bataaya ki 'lackme fishan wyk' main plus sies model kaa special sho hota he jisamen vah walk karti he
 i feel very bad thinking this
 aapako bataa den,uk2, UK4, US0 model ke sies hote hai jis aadhaar par modells kaa chayan kiya jaataa he
 My question is why is plus size considered special
 inke liye alag se ramp walk kyon yojit kii jaati he? kyon nahin in sabhi model ko main stream, fishan stream kaa hissaa banaate hai?vahiin unhone bataaya ki zyaadaatar bhartiya mahilaon kaa everej figure sies 16 he
 On the other hand, if you are selling in UK, UK4, US0 size sample market, which woman are you targeting to buy? Model Narmata Tripathi says that with 9 Zero size girls, take a plus size model Do not try to make yourself look great
 unhone kaha 90 pratishat samay daski tone vaali skin or plus sies vaali model ko kaam karne kaa mauka tak nahin miltaa
 They want fair-skinned girls
 aise main unka aatmavishvaas hilta he or vah andar se maayoos hoti hai

 Rahul said that we have seen the Nirav Modi, Rotomac case and more cases will come up
 congress adhyaksh bole ki bijepi chunaavon main hajaaron karod rupye kharch kar rahi he, aakhir ye paisa kahaan se aa rahaa he
 All this money is coming from people like Nirav Modi, Vijay Mallya
 isliye ye sawaal hi nahin uthta he ki piem modi kyon is mudde par chup hai
 He said that the PM has about 2 hours to explain to the children how to pass the exam, but there is no time to speak even a minute on this issue
 rahul ne kaha ki pehle unhonenotbandilagu kii, phir puure desh se kaha ki bainkon kii line main khadey ho jaaen or bank ke peeche se blike mani ko white kiya gaya
 Apart from this, Rahul also targeted the PM via tweet

 bihar main vidhansabha kii 10 siton par hone ja rahe upachunaav ko lekar hue nae gathbandhanon ko bada raajnneetik parivartan mana ja rahaa he
 For the first time in this election, not only the Left parties are talking about stopping the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) by creating a new front, but the ruling Janata Dal (united) in the state along with its rival Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) as well as the Congress The Mahagathbandhan has announced to put a dent in the election summer
 yah chunaav na keval agle varsh hone vaale bihar vidhansabha chunaav ke purv kaa semifinal mana ja rahaa he, balki donon gathbandhanon ke liye yah chunaav agnipariksha bhi he
 However, it is not easy for both the alliances to take on the BJP
 gathbandhan ke liye sabase badi samasya ek-duusare dalon ke voton ko ekajute banaae rakhane kii hoti he
 For the first time in this election, Congress has joined hands with the ruling JDU in Bihar, while Lalu Prasad's RJD is also in alliance with JDU this time
 do dashak purv jab lalu prasad or nitish kumaar ek saath the tab donon kaa muqabla congress se tha
 Later Lalu became part of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), while Nitish joined the National Democratic Alliance (NDA)
 vaise abhi tak siton ko lekar tasviir spasht nahin he parantu itnaa tay ho chukaa he argedy or jediu chaar-chaar jabaki congress do siton par chunaav ladegi
 Lalu and Nitish have said that the issue is not to divide seats, but to stop BJP
 vaise pichley loksabhaa chunaav main argedy ko jediu se adhik mat mili the
 At that time, voters had said that Nitish will vote in the assembly elections, yet to bring Narendra Modi to the center
 ab yaksha prashn yah he ki lalu ke saath gathbandhan kar nitish apana vahi aakarshan barkaraar rakh paaenge
 Nitish's fascination has been on the basis of work among the forward castes, but how much support Nitish will be able to gain for the forward castes in the new alliance is also a big question
 modi ko ab pyjama pahanayegi bihar kii janata?vaise bijepi is gathbandhan ko 'jangalraj part do' qaraar de rahi he
 The left parties have also announced to contest the elections together, calling the alliance of RJD, Congress and JD-S an opportunistic alliance
 bihar main pehali baar bhartiya communist party (sipiai), marxvaadi communist party (sipiem) or bhartiya communist party-marxvaadi-leninvaadee (sipiem-maale) saath main chunaav lard rahi he
 CPM will field candidates in three seats, CPI in two and CPM (male) in five seats
 raajnneetik vishleshak surendra kishor kehete hai ki yah chunaav mukhya rup se lalu or nitish ke gathbandhan kii agnipariksha hogi
 By the way, there has been a tradition till now that the voter who wears kurta (forms government at the center) must wear pajama (government in Bihar)
 vah kehete hai ki jab kendra main 1977 main morarji desai ke netritv main janata party kii sarkaar bani thi, tab uske baad hue bihar vidhansabha chunaav main karpuri thakur kii sarkaar bani thi
 Similarly, in 1980, when the Congress government was formed at the center, the Congress government was formed in Bihar
 vaise kishor yah bhi maanate hai ki chunaav ke dauraan in gathbandhanon kii asli pariksha hogi
 In the last Lok Sabha election, JDU also got the votes of anti-lalu voters, so after joining this alliance, they will be able to attract these votes to them, it has to be seen
 manmohan sarkaar ke mantrimandal kaa vistaar jald hoga
 There are reports that several new ministers may take oath in Manmohan's cabinet on 28 October
 28 oktober ko cabinet main pherbadal?khabaren hai ki 28 oktober ko upie sarkaar ke cabinet main pherbadal ho saktaa he
 Looking at the programs of President Pranab Mukherjee, only on Sunday, October 28, the day seems empty, when the cabinet reshuffle can be implemented
 khabaron ke mutabik cabinet pherbadal main ek se zyada vibhaag sambhaal rahe mantriyon kaa bhaar halkaa kiya jayega
 In this context, 2 to 3 new cabinet ministers and 3 to 4 new ministers of state can take oath and they can be handed over vacated departments
 sarkaar ke sarvshereshth chaar mantralayon main koi pherbadal nahin hoga
 Who is in the minister's race? In the political corridors, the biggest speculation at this time is that who will be the one who will take the chair of the minister in the cabinet reshuffle? There is a possibility that a 7-time MP from Maharashtra, Vilas Muttemwar, may get a place in the cabinet to fill Vilasrao Deshmukh's place

 Chiranjeevi, who merged his party Prajarajyam with the Congress, is also named in the ministerial race
 manmohan mantrimandalke is pherbadal main rahul ke yuva brigade ko kitni tavajjo milti he, is par to najar rahegi hi saath hi desh ye bhi dekhnaa chahega ki aaropon se ghire apane mantriyon ke saath upie sarkaar kya saluk karti he? It seems that Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar is on the front line of harming his party
 guuruuvaar ko unhone piem modi ko 'neech insaan' bataa diya
 After this, PM Modi responded to this in a public meeting in Gujarat and said, 'you called us inferior, said of the lower caste
 ye 18 tarikh ko nattejey hi dikhaaenge ki gujarat ke bete ko aisa kahana kitna baari padegaa
 In this way, Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar has once again made the Congress in trouble by making controversial statements
 iske pehle ve kai baar aisa kar chuke hai
 In the Lok Sabha elections, he had described PM Modi as a chaiwala, which the Congress suffered a lot
 piem ne janata se kaha, 'aapane mujhepradhanmantrike taur par dekha he
 Have you ever noticed that i have ever done anything low
 congress ke logon aap maansik santulan ganvaa chuke hai
 i do not care to sit with the poor of this country
 mujhe garv he ki bhale hi main neech jati kaa hum, lekin ucch kaam karnaa mere sanskaar he
 BJP has also become an attacker on Mani Shankar Aiyar's statement
 ek press conference kar party netaa ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki jo darbar kahata he vahi darbari kehete hai
 It is his feudal arrogance that only the Gandhi family can govern
 matdaan se badla lene kaa aahvangujaratmen piem modi ne kaha, 'main sabhi logon se vinati karata hum ki jisane mere liye aise shabdon kaa istamaal kiya he, desh ke pradhanmantri ke liye istemaal kiya he, main to ye hi kahuunga ki koi inke kilaaf koi ek shabd naa bolen
 But if you feel angry for such a mentality in your heart, then vote on the 9th and 14th, work high by pressing the button on the lotus sign
 mujhe bhale hi neech jati kaa kahe, bhale hi apshabd bole, lekin koi duusare ko kuch bolegaa nahin
 In Lokshahi, the only way to teach such people a lesson is to suppress the lotus sign
 mujhe maut kaa saudagar kaha gaya, jail main daalane ki koshish gai
 The government is also presenting this statement in a partial way
 unhone kaha ki kanoon mantri ko videshi naagarik ke bayaan par bharosa he lekin unhen bhartiya naagarik avinaash raay ke bayaan par vishwaas nahin he

 Zikra's family members said that her doll is her favorite toy and she plays with her doll throughout the day
 doctoron ne tarkeeb nikaali or maasoom ko plaster chadhaane se pehle uske saamne uski gudiya ko plaster chadhaaya
 What was it then, the girl got the plaster easily

 Before the final phase of the Lok Sabha elections, there are frequent statements by the leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party which are increasing their difficulties
 pehle sadhvi pragna, phir anant hegade or phir madhya pradesh ke bijepi ke pravaktaa anil saumitr ne nathuram godse-mahatma gandhi vivaad ko lekar bayaan dete hue mahatma gandhi ko pakistan kaa rashtrapita bataaya
 After making a statement on Godse, BJP President Amit Shah expressed his displeasure and said that Sadhvi, Hegde's statement has nothing to do with the party
 vahiin mahatma gandhi ko pakistan kaa rashtrapita bataane vaale bijepi netaa or pravaktaa anil saumitr ko party ne suspend kar diya
 Please tell that Anil Soumitra of Madhya Pradesh wrote on his Facebook account on Friday morning, 'he was the father of the nation, but of the nation of Pakistan
 bharat raashtra main to unke jaise karodon putr hue, kuch laayak to kuch nalayak
 However, he did not write Mahatma Gandhi in his post but the signs were clear
 nilamban ke baad badale surabijepi se nilamban ke baad anil saumitr ke sur badal gaye hai
 Anil Soumitra has said that he has unwavering reverence for Gandhiji
 ajtak se baat karte hue anil saumitr ne kaha, "nilamban kii chitthee abhi mujhe mili nahin he mujhe media se hi jaankaree mili he ki party ne mujh par karrwai kii he
 There is a process of action when the party feels that the party worker has done something outside the party's policies, then the party normally takes action on it, they have asked for the answer and the answer is based on the loyalty and commitment of the party Will give anil saumitr ne nilamban ke baad kaha ki 'gandhiji ke bare main bhartiya janata party or unke sabhi netaaon-kaaryakartaaon ke man main sammaan he jo atoot or akatya he
 We never said any abusive words about Gandhiji and never misused Gandhiji's name
 unhone kaha, "meraa vyaktigat yah maananaa he ki ham log jitna gandhi ji kaa sammaan karte hai utana shaayad hi koi karata he
 Though the Congress people claim it, but the name of Gandhiji has been misused by the Congress Party to establish its empire
 "gauratlab he ki anil saumitr madhya pradesh main bhartiya janata party ke pravaktaa hai
 If seen on his Facebook profile, his picture is seen with former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan as well as many veteran leaders
 saath hi unke kai post aise bhi hai jo vivaadit ho sakate hai
 In the last phase to be held on May 19, votes will also be cast in Madhya Pradesh
 darasal, mahatma gandhi ke hatyare nathuram godse ko lekar beete do dinon main bavaal ho gaya he
 First BJP leader and candidate from Bhopal, Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, described Nathuram Godse as a patriot and was then defended by Anant Hegde, a minister in the central government, though he later said that his Twitter had been hacked
 sadhvi pragna ne apane bayaan main nathuram ke bare main kaha ki vah deshbhakt the, hai or rahen
 On which the entire opposition was furious, the entire opposition including Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi had called this statement dangerous
 jiske baad unhen maafee maangani padi thi, haalanki bijepi ne pragna ke is bayaan se khud ko alag kar liya tha
 At the same time, when there was a ruckus on the statement of Sadhvi, Anant Hegde, a minister in the Modi government, tweeted that there is no need to apologize for this statement
 balki unhone to ye bhi kah diya ki is charchaa se nathuram godse khush ho rahe honge

 Those who have weddings in their homes are bringing their old gold and turning it into new ones
 lekin nai kharidari koi nahin kar rahaa
 According to Jain, the situation is such that if someone is coming to sell their gold, then the jewelers do not have the cash to give it in return
 jain ne bataaya ki kuch din pehle ek graahak unke passonabechney ke liye aayaa
 He needed money to pay the hospital's hefty bills
 lekin uski madad nahin ho pai kyonki badale main dene ke liye cash hi nahin tha

 People are spending whatever cash is available at such times only on basic needs like food

 'most of the jewelers say that after November 8, most of their transaction is done by card payment
 card pement par sarvice charge hota he jo 1
 40 rupees to 2 rupees or more depending on the limit of the card
 jain kehete hai- 'shaadiyon ke sijan main jab koi sona kharidta he to nunatam kharidari 3 lakh rupye kii hoti he
 If this amount is given by the card, then that service sits in the charge boxes
 card ke saath ye bhi dekha jaataa he ki aadha hi bhugtan hota he kyonki har card kii limit hoti he
 Therefore, most people prefer cash transactions only

 jhaveri bazaar main ek julri store ke maalik rishant jain kehete hai- 'logon ke paas itnaa cash aane main vakt lagegaa ki wo sona kharidne laayak kharch karne main samarth ho saken
 During the wedding season, whatever gold was purchased was usually in cash

 Bringing flexibility in its stand on Article 370 giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir, the BJP said that it should be discussed whether the state has benefited from this constitutional provision
 bhaajapa ke pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaae jane ke baad rajya main apni pehali raily main narendra modi ne kaha ki unki party is mudde ke vibhinn ayaamon par charchaa kar rahi he
 He supported the views of BJP President Rajnath Singh in which he (rajnath) said at the Lalkar rally that if Article 370 proved to be profitable, then his party would support it
 yah bhaajapa ke us rukh ke khilaaf he, jisamen bharat main jammu-kashmir ko vishesh darja die jane vaale anuchhed ko purna rup se radd karne kii maang ja rahi thi
 Mentioning this provision, Modi said that women are not given equal rights in the state as compared to other states of the country
 rajya sarkaar ke aankadon main pradesh main record sankhya main paryatak aane kaa ullekh kiya gaya he, haalanki bhaajapa ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ne rajya main paryaton ke prabhavit hone kaa daawa kiya
 Modi said, tourism is getting affected here
 paryatak himachal pradesh ja rahe hai
 There are good tours for beauty and reverence here
 hindi cinema ke 100 varsh puraa hone kaa ullekh karte hue modi ne kaha, yahaan kaaphi filmon kii shooting hoti he
 Why no film institute was established in Jammu and Kashmir? It is sad that he is not interested in development
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki ladakh kshetra main paryaton ko badhaava dene ke liye sarkaar leh ke raste kailash maanasarobar ke maarg par kyon nahin vichaar karti he? isse pehle bhaajapa adhyaksh rajnath singh ne raily ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki unki party china ke saath seemaa samjhauta ke vishay ko sansad main uthaaegi
 The BJP president said, recently Prime Minister Manmohan Singh went to China, where he had entered into a border cooperation agreement with China, which has many controversial provisions
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri ne samjhauta karne se pehle sansad ko vishwaas main lenaa jaruri nahin samajha
 Superstition is a big problem of our country
 yahaan har insaan kisi na kisi choti-badi cheez ko apane lack kii chaabi maanata he
 But what if this luck raita spreads so much that your life becomes difficult? This is what this film of Sonam Kapoor and Dulquer Salmaan tells you
 lekhika anuja chouhan kii kitaab da joya factor par bani ye film, kahani he joya solanki (sonam kapur) ke bare main, jo 25 june 1983 ko paidaa hui thi
 Since then Zoya's father (sanjay Kapoor) considers her the lucky charm of cricket
 joya ke pita or bhai (sikandar kher) cricket ke bade fain hai or joya bachapan se hi unhen cricket match jitati aa rahi hai
 Zoya works in an ad agency and continues to curse her luck to a large extent
 lekin phir use miltaa he ek aisa project jo uski kismat badal detaa he or joya ban jaati he india kii lucky charm
 Not only this, Nikhil Khoda (dulquer Salman), the captain of the Indian cricket team and the prince of Zoya's dreams, also falls in love with her
 lekin kehete hai naa badi takat ke saath aati hai badi jimmedaariyaan or museebataan
 So just now Zoya has to face these difficulties and save her love too
 is film kii kahani bahut simple he
 Two people who love each other, a cricket team that believes in luck and superstition and a girl is a villain
 ab aise main galat kya ho saktaa he
 Not everything but a lot
 film main sonam kapur ne joya solanki kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa he, jo cricket ke liye lucky he lekin uski khud kii kismat thodi kharaab hi he
 Zoya is flirtatious, flamboyant and blunt
 joya kaa kirdaar bilkul vaisaa he jaise bhi aap sonam kapur ko aaraam se imagin kar sakate hai
 Sonam Kapoor's work is also very good
 lekin isamen thodi kami rah gai he
 Sonam does not give you anything new as Zoya
 aapako unhen dekhakar film khubasurat kii mili kii yaad jarur aa jaati he
 Dulquer Salmaan is the real strong link in the film
 unki acting, unki aawaaj or unki hotnes ke charche is film ke baad khub hone vaale hai
 There are many scenes where Dulkar only talks to his expressions and steals your heart
 angad bedi ek badhiya villen hai
 Sanjay Kapoor and Sikander Kher are also in this film, but sadly they did not get to do much
 film ke baaki saporting actors ne apana kaam sahi nibhaayaa
 Apart from this, the cameos in the film were also good
 diarector abhishek sharma is simple kahani ko thodaa or behatar dikhaa sakate the
 He performed well with romance but could not connect the film perfectly
 haalanki film ke second half main dikhaaya gaya cricket match aapako asli cricket match kii feel detaa he
 This is a romantic comedy film whose jokes are not very good
 film main jokes se zyada aapako logon kii harkaton par hansi aegi
 Admittedly, Zoya Solanki works in an ad agency in the film, but this does not mean that the ad must be filled in the entire film
 sonam ke kirdaar kii costums behad shandaar hai
 The chemistry of Sonam and Dulquer was fine
 film ke gane achche hai, lekin in gaanon kaa lagbhag har duusare seen main chal janaa aapako bahut pareshaan karata he
 Zoya Factor has its own good things
 film ke kuch sikvence badhiya hai, lekin phir bhi ye thodi si kam he

 There are many reasons for this

 There has been an increase in freight but its growth is also around 5 percent, which can be said to be better than last year
 lekin railway se maal dhulaai karnaa kahin mahangaa sabit hota he
 Road transport is taking a heavy toll on the railways in this matter
 railway ke paas kshamta bhi nahin he
 There is no roadmap to increase growth in this budget
 selleri badhane ke kaaran bhi railway kii cost badhati ja rahi he
 In such a situation, the railways can be benefited only by increasing the revenue
 railway ke liye ingine-wagon khareednaa phaayde kaa sauda hota he kyonki isse uski kshamta tatkaal badhati he
 Railways are going to buy 700 engines, 12000 wagons and 5160 coaches in 2018-19

 You do not have the answer to this
 iske saath hi shailaja ne ram bilas paswan se poocha ki aap pramotion main rigerveshan ko kaise lagu karenge
 Shailaja questioned the government's intention and asked why the government is not thinking about women's reservation
 vot lene ke liye yah bill to laa rahi he
 But when will the government think about women? He said that the government is taking forward the RSS agenda to completely abolish reservation
 shailaja ne kaha ki jab se aapaki sarkaar bani he tab se aapane apane bajet main savarna jati ke liye koi praavdhaan kyon nahin kiya
 Now the election has come close, so this bill is being brought
 congress ne apane menifesto main is baat kaa zikr kiya tha
 Shailaja said that the government reduced scholarship and was no longer able to respond to people
 shailaja ne kaha ki uniwarsity main aap aarakshan bilkul khatm kar rahe the baad main jab hallaa hua to phir aap isapar ruke

 ayurvedaki aath shakhaon main se ek shalya tantra yaa surgery shuruyaat se hi ek atyant mahatvapurn or upyogividharahi he
 Maharaja Kashiraj Divodas Dhanvantari of Varanasi has been the father of the surgical sect in Ayurveda
 acharya sushrut (500 i
 e ) kashiraj divodas dhanvantari ke saat shishyon main pramukh the
 He learned surgery and practiced medicine in Kashi (varanasi)
 unhone ayurveda ke sabase mahatvapurn granthon main se ek sushrut samhita kii rachana kii jo shalya chikitsa ke mul siddhanton par upyogi jaankaree detii he
 He has written in detail about the effective method and technique associated with many surgeries
 kshatigrast naak ko phir se bananaa (rhinoplasty), kaan kii lau ko phir se thik karnaa (lobuloplasty), mutr thili kii pathari ko nikaalnaa, laparotomi or sigerian section, ghaav kaa upachaar, jaale, tuuti haddi jodpha, koi antirak phoda, aant or mutr thili ke chhidron se jude upachaar, prostate kaa baduya, bavasir, fistula aadi ke upachaar kii kargar vidhi kii khoj, shalya chikitsa main unki dakshata ko darshaate hai
 Sushruta's designed surgical instruments, antidotes, firefighting and jaundice abstinence are other methods of treatment that can cure many diseases for which surgery is considered the only option
 unhone chah vibhinn shreniyon main 100 se adhik viksit chikitsiya aujaar or vibhinn shalya kriyaaon main istemaal hone vaale 20 prakaar ke dhardaar sargical upkarnon ko viksit kiya
 Along with this, silk and linen threads, plant fibers and cell tissue were also used for various needles and stitches
 unhone aant ke chhidr kii surgery main chinte ke jabade kaa prakritik rup se galkar nasht ho jane vaale clip ke rup main prayog kiya, jo nae-nae prayogon or takanic ke upyog main unki doordarshita kaa parichay detaa he
 He was the first to discuss ophthalmology, eye diseases, and eye medicine
 najar kii kamajori, motiyobind kii surgery ke safed bhaag, netron ke palak se judi samasyaon evam anya kai netra rogon or unke nidaan kaa tarika bataaya
 He has also described in detail about various diseases of ear, nose and throat and their treatment
 shalya chikitsa ke kshetra main unke athulaneey yogadan or ayurveda ke anya moolbhoot siddhanton ke kshetra main unke kaary ko dekhte hue unhen 'shalya chikitsa kaa janak' bhi kaha jaataa he
 Although he has the highest contribution in the field of surgery, he has also contributed significantly in gynecology, obstetric and pediatric management
 sushrut ke samay main ayurveda main surgery kaa bada prachlan tha
 But with time the use of surgery became less frequent
 vishvavidhyalayon main ayurvedic chikitsa pranali ko padhaaye jane kii shuruyaat 1927 main banaras hindu uniwarsity se hui thi
 Then in 1964 the post graduation studies in Ayurveda started, then in the modern era, the era of use of surgery in Ayurveda started
 kai prasiddh ayurvedic sarjan vishvavidhyalay se jude or ayurveda main shalya pranali ke shikshan, prashikshan, shodh evam upyog ke kshetra main saraahneey yogadan diya

 ayurveda main shalya chikitsa ke punaruddhar kii is prakriya main kai mahatvapurn kadam uthaae gaye
 -establishment of many ancient surgical principles and philosophy -using the surgical procedure and technique described in the ancient and important treatise of Ayurveda like Sushruta Samhita -therapy of Ayurveda's specific medical practice and medicine in diseases cured through surgery Doing the diseases that require surgery, in place of alkali, fire and burns Area treatment, which can be simply avoided undergone surgery in Ayurveda and their use
 ayurveda main prachlit vibhinn shalya kriyaaon main se kuch kii to vishwastar par manyata he or ksharsutra se fistula jaisi beemaari kaa upachaar to iske sabase uttam or kargar udaahranon main se ek he
 The alkaloids treatment of Bhagandar is the formation of an abnormal hole in the anus due to a chronic inflammation between the anus and the outer surface of the anus
 is beemaari kaa sabase prachlit upaay he—shalya chikitsa
 With the introduction of many tools and new technology in modern surgery for the treatment of anal fistula, the treatment has become more modern, but its end result is still not very satisfactory, because after surgery the disease resurfaces
 saath hi, mel dwaar ke sikud jane, surgery ke dauraan hui kshati ke kaaran mel ko rokane par niyantran main kami jaisi badi pareshaaniyaan aa khadi hoti hai
 Sometimes these problems become more serious than the original disease
 ayurveda main guda ke fistula ke liye ek anuthi upachaar paddati bataai gai he
 a medicated thread — the Kshatrasutra — is tied in the Bhagandar region
 dhire-dhire yah puure bhagandar kshetra ko katkar alag kar detaa he or guda maarg kii sankuchak mansapeshiyon ko bina koi nuksaan pahunchaae beemaari ko thik kar detaa he
 This technique of treatment was re-established by the Department of Surgery of Banaras Hindu University and duly recognized by the Central Council for Research in Ayurveda (CCRAS) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)
 ksharsutra ek aushadhiyukt dhaagaa (rasinic batti) he jise apamarg, kadli, palash, neem aadi vanaspatiyon ke avyav ko guggalu or haridra jaise anya paudhon ke saath milakar banaaya jaataa he
 Repeatedly wrapping these ingredients on a thread of linen used in surgical work, it is made useable in treatment
 saamaanya or chote bhagandar kii sthiti main upachaar kii safalataa dar shat-pratishat he or jatil, puraane or dobaaraa ubhare bhagandar ke upachaar main isaki safalataa kaa dar 93 se 97 pratishat tak rahata he
 Successfully treated more than 40,000 patients by this method S

 It has been done in the rectal and rectal diseases department of the hospital

 s
 hospital) main neshnal risource centre kii sthapana kii he
 The center is equipped with all the basic and modern facilities related to the treatment of common diseases in Gudmarg and rectum, including Bhagandar
 bavasir bhi ek anya aam samasya he or 10 karod se adhik bhartiya is rog ke shikaar hai
 In Ayurveda, many medicinal herbs have been prescribed to remove constipation and intestinal troubles from the root
 ksharsutra kaa prayog or athwa kshar (aushadhiy vanaspatiyon se praapt lei) kaa prabhavit kshetra par lep karke bavasir ke masse ko alag kar dena is rog ko thik karne ke bade kargar upaay hai
 Wound healing in surgery is also another area in which Ayurveda's contribution is extraordinary
 100 se upar vidhiyaan or powder, paste, patton ke taaja ras, maraham, evam aushadhiy tel tathaa ghi se bani samagriyon ke rup main anek prakaar kii dawaaen uplabdh hai jinka prayog karke puraane or aasaani se nahin bharne vaale ghaavon ko thik kiya ja rahaa he
 The fundamental principle of Ayurveda for healing wounds that are not easily drying is - convert the wicked ulcer (wound) into a pure ulcer
 iske liye vibhinn staron par anek prakaar kii dawaaiyon kii jarurat hoti he
 Wicked ulcers or bad wounds are usually infected wounds filled with inanimate tissues that cause bad odor and pus
 neem, karanj, papeeta, daruharidra aadi vanaspatiyaan dusht vran ko shuddh vran main badal detii hai isliye inhen vran shodhan dawaaen bhi kaha jaataa he
 While jasmine, Haridra, Manjistha, Durva, sandalwood are helpful in healing wounds quickly, hence they are called ulcer planting medicines
 kuch dawaaen aisi bhi hai jo ghaavon kii chikitsa ke donon charnon main upyogi hoti hai
 The Panchavalkal (pancha-five, Valkal-bark), described in Ayurveda for its beneficial effects on wound healing, includes the bark of five plants such as Vat, Udubar, Peepal, Parish and Palaksha
 ye paudhe puure desh main saamaanya rup se or prachurtaa se uplabdh hai
 This compound drug was evaluated on scientific standards and found that the drug inhibits the growth of microorganisms, increases the formation of new blood vessels, increases collagen synthesis and factors necessary for quick healing of the wound
 chunki takanic or dawaaen, donon hi hamaare desh main bharpoor maatra main uplabdh hai isliye is vidhi se upachaar videshon se dressing material aayaat karne ke mukaable bahut sasta ho gaya he
 The use of leech is another para-surgical technique that Ayurvedic surgeons use to heal non-drying wounds, as well as to add skin to plastic surgery
 jokon kii vishesh prajatiyaan hai jo vishakt prakruti kii nahin hotin
 They are used to suck blood out of the wound around the infected wound as needed
 isse rakt kaa sancharan badhata he or ghaav ko teji se bharne main madad milti he
 The use of leech is also very effective in curing diseases like eczema and baldness
 ayurveda main kai anya gaiyr-shalya kriya vaale prayogon kaa varnan he jinka vaigyanik rup se akalan hua he
 If the prostate enlarged, surgery was said to be the only way to treat it
 iske sthaan par prayog se pramanit hua he ki aushadhiy enema ke saath-saath gokshuradi guggul or varun prostate ko thik karne main upyogi hote hai jo pikar seven karne vaali aushadhiyaan hai
 Varun, Gokshur, Stonestone are said to be very effective in correcting urinary stones
 ye davaaiyaan mutr kii thili main pathari kaa bananaa rokatii hai or shalya chikitsa ke baad phir se pathari banane kii sambhaavna ko samaapt karti hai
 a urine stent is a thin tube placed in the ureter
 ye ayurvedic dawaaen mutr stant ko lambey samay tak kargar rakhane or stant ke mutrashay main rakhe jane ke baad uske bheetar lavan ke jamaa hone se rokane main sahaayak hoti hai
 The contribution of Ayurvedic surgeons in curing bone related diseases is commendable
 kuch aise shikshan santhaan saath hi saath nijee prectisionar bhi hai jo haddiyon se jude maamalon khaastaur se haddi kii tut-foot se jude maamalon, peeth ke nichle hisse main dard, discs kaa khisakna evam anya puraani bimariyon kaa ilaaj karte hai
 In addition, fire extinguishers and hemorrhage by some specialized equipment are some other measures that are very effective in relieving chronic muscle pain
 ayurveda kii shalya kriya main prashikshit streerog evam netrarog ke ayurvedic sarjan apane-apane kshetra main shalya chikitsa bhi karte hai
 They are capable of performing general gynecological and postpartum surgeries apart from some of the specialized techniques of treatment described in Ayurveda
 ayurvedic netra sarjan ankhon kii saamaanya surgery jaise motiyobind nikaalnaa aadi ke saath-saath duusari netra sambandhi surgery main sakasham hai
 In Ayurveda, special activities associated with ophthalmology are known as Kriyakalpa
 kriyakalp ek vishesh prakriya he jiske dwaara retina se judi vibhinn samasyaon or anya puraane netra rogon kaa safal upachaar kiya jaataa he
 Although the introduction of surgery in Ayurveda started in the post-independence period by studying and training post-graduation of surgical system at Banaras Hindu University but later it was also started in many other educational institutions
 ab ayurveda main post grajuation shikshan kaa sanchaalan sisiiem or bharat sarkaar ke aayush mantralay dwaara hota he, kai anya pratishthit sansthaanon ne bhi shalya tantra main post grajuation yani emes (ayurveda) kii padhai shuru karai he
 Post graduation training in the surgical system is of three years which can be done after graduation in Ayurveda
 aaj bina surakshit anaesthesia or life saport system ke surgery kii baat sochi bhi nahin ja sakati or yah baat ayurvedic surgery par bhi lagu hoti he
 This was realized at Banaras Hindu University and the introduction of anesthesia in Ayurveda and later CCIM also started a post graduation course in anesthesiology in the Ayurveda department
 ye ayurvedic sansthaanon or nijee sansthaanon main ayurvedic sarjanon kii jaruraton ko puraa kar rahe the lekin anaesthesia par ayurveda main post grajuation course (sangyaaharan) ko achaanak band kar dene se ayurveda main shalya chikitsa kii visheshgyata kii disha main ho rahe kaaryon ko dhakka pahunchaa he or is vishay par tatkaal dhyaan dene kii aavashyaktaa he
 In short, it can be said that the use of surgery in Ayurveda was very popular in ancient times
 banaras hindu uniwarsity ke prakhyat vidwaanon ne 1960 ke dashak main ayurveda main surgery kaa maarg punah prashast kiya lekin anek kaarnon se yah ab tak apni ucch kshamta ko praapt nahin kar sakaa he
 The development of surgery in Ayurveda requires continuous exploration and research along with full support of modern technology and facilities so that the glory of surgery in Ayurveda can be restored and its possible use in human welfare is possible

 # TZH bharat durbhaagya se vyakti kendrit hone kii aadat se kabhi nijaat nahin paa sakaa he
 From media to politics, from cinema to art, our story starts around a few individuals and gets the result
 taaja maamla bollywood kesuperstar salmaan khanke paksh-vipaksh main uthne vaali atirecopurna awaajon kaa he
 The kind of celebration that has been seen in this case is a matter of concern
 salmaan khan maamle main aisa kuch bhi nahin hua, jo is desh ke liye nayaa ho
 a powerful person manages to use the law in his favor
 ye udhaaharan hamane tab se dekha he, jab se hosh sambhala he
 The actor, named Salman Khan, drives the alcoholic drunk on the sidewalk
 natijatan so rahe garib vyakti kii maut ho jaati he
 The road accident is no great surprise
 salmaan se bhi ho gai
 But the hero who helps the magistrates on the cinematic screen does not stop at the scene after the accident
 bhaag jaataa he
 Well there is a difference between the screen and the real image
 jaahir he salmaan bhi utane mahaan nahin hai jitne parde par darshaae jate hai
 Fleeing from the scene was not only a criminal mistake, but also insensitivity
 phir ek pal thahar kar sochen to bharat main durbhaagya se accident ke baad zyadattar maamalon main yahi to hota he
 In Salman too, weakness like ordinary people is not very surprising
 in maamalon main log apane rasookh kaa phayda uthaakar aksar batch nikalate hai
 Salman is on bail for the last 17 years
 vah vakeelon kii fouj khadi kar sakate hai
 Salman has been protecting his expensive lawyer till now
 is baar bhi kuch vakt ke liye to unhone aisa kar hi diya he
 Those who have looked closely at Salman's career, it will not be difficult to guess when the process of creating a big heart's 'bhaijaan', which helps everyone
 salmaan ke dost or mashhoor abhinayta sanjay dutt jo deshvirohi gatividhiyon ke aaropee tehraae gaye the, unke saath bhi kuch aisa hi maamla tha
 Both the stars changed their image after getting into a court-court affair
 dhire-dhire in sitaron se judi khabaron kaa swaroop badal gaya
 Suddenly, Salman and Sanjay Dutt's image started to become a helpful person
 yah sachai he yaa sirf piaar (public relation), yah to gaharaai main utar kar padtaal karne par hi pataa saktaa he
 It is also no less interesting that both stars tried to capitalize on this helpful image in their court cases
 salmaan khan 1998 main pehali baar jail gaye the
 This incident passed after a decade
 soshal media kranti ke taur par ubhara
 It began to rinse every hero's image
 soshal media ke aane se kai logon ne ummid kii ki ab media management kar sakane main samarth sitare logon ko chal nahin paaenge
 But the manner in which people, intellectuals and social media were also engaged in performing his arti on Salman's case, it was an uncomfortable situation
 ek supersitara jise adaalat ne apradhi ghoshit kar diya ho, uske liye padhe-likhe logon kaa bawalaa hue janaa taarkikta ke lihaaj se kamjor sthiti he
 Social media also let Salman escape tough questions
 chhitput awaajon se itar adhikansh awaajen unke paksh main hi thim
 Salman's 'being Human' image proved to be his biggest support
 is chhavi ke nirmaan or iske istemaal ke baad yah bhi sochna chahie ki kya yah chhavi bhi ek jhooth he
 Tales of Salman's generosity have come to us only through those close to him
 soshal media ne logon ko apni baat kehane kaa bada manch de diya he
 But does this mean that we will not respect non-compliant matters as well
 salmaan ke saath yaa unke khilaaf uthne vaali har aawaaj swatantra adaalat kii tarah faisle suna rahi thi
 Does the Indian youth who are educated do not even understand such a minor thing? salmaan par chalane vaale kaarykram or unke sheershakon par gaur kijiega
 The country's biggest decision
 kya vaaki! is desh main isse bada kuch nahin gata pichley kuch dinon main
 Salman has been granted bail by the High Court
 abhi vah doshamukt nahin hue hai
 The kind of celebration being held on bail does not seem appropriate from anywhere
 salmaan ke lakhon phans unpar nisaar hue ja rahe hai
 Will there be such moral pressure on Salman, the hero of such a huge public, to accept the truth (whatever the truth is)
 is maamle par najar isliye bhi rahegi, taaki yah dekha ja sake ki kya nyaaypalika kii giraft se aise taqatvar log batch nikalne main kaamyaab rahenge? ek or vajah se is maamle par najar banaae rakhni chahie ki log apradhi or celebrity apradhi ke maamalon main kis kism kaa fark baratate hai

 'rajeev gandhi ke saath koun koun yudhpot par savaar tha, is sawaal ke jawaab main kaha gaya, 'sonia gandhi divangat pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ke saath ienes viraat par savaar hui thim

 When asked about the daily expenses of INS Virat in 1987, the Navy said that the directorate concerned did not have any information about the expenses incurred during the visit

 The judge of the Rajasthan High Court on Wednesday suggested that the cow be made a national animal, giving a different view of the national bird peacock
 justise mahesh chandra sharma ne kaha, 'jo mor he, ye aaajeevan brahmacharee hota he
 He never had sex with Morni
 iske jo aansu aate hai, morni use chugakar garbhvatee hoti he or mor yaa morni ko janm detii he
 ' unhone kaha ki mor brahmacharee he, isliye bhagwaan krishna apane sir par morpankh lagaate hai
 There are many divine qualities inside the cow as well, in view of which it should be declared a national animal
 ' gaay ko rashtriya pashu ghoshit karne kaa suzav dene ke alaava justise sharma ne rajasthan sarkaar se kaha ki yah sunshchit kiya jaae ki govadh karne waalon ko aaajeevan karawas kii sajaa di jaae

 Congress's Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Wednesday said that Narendra Modi has now been acquitted by the Supreme Court on charges of Gujarat riots and all political parties in the country should accept it
 kendriya mantri or ensipi netaa prafull patel ne yah tippanee karte hue kaha ki ab godhra ke baad hue dangon ke silsile main modi par sawaal uthaaya janaa band hona chahie
 According to Patel, we are in the era when judicial system is considered as the last way to get justice on any issue and if it has given any decision then we should respect it
 ham is par aage sawaal khadey nahin karenge
 He was answering questions in which Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in a television interview accused the Chief Minister of Gujarat that the government was inciting the 2002 riots in the state
 patel ne kaha ki saakshaatkaar main koi vyakti apane vichaar pesh kar saktaa he lekin raajnneeti sirf netaaon kii soch par nahin balki logon kii soch par bhi hoti he
 The NCP leader said, but the fact is that if the judicial system has given a final stop to any dispute, then we should let it remain there
 congress ke ek anya sahyogi neshnal conference ke netaa or kendriya mantri faruk abdulla bhi modi vivaad main nahin padana chaahate
 He said that Modi win or lose but the people of India will decide who will become the Prime Minister

 gayak balram aryaa bhajnaatmak style main gaae ja rahaa tha
 Elders who came to listen to Bhupendra Singh Hooda at a block level meeting in Mohana, Faridabad started being sattvik in this era of political politics
 yah vahi gayak tha, jise thik ek din pehle maine faridabad main narendra modi kii raily main gaate hue dekha or suna tha
 Then all the members of Balarama Arya's troupe had a colorful turban on their heads and all the kalfadars were wearing white kurtas
 narendra modi kii raily ke liye inkaa manch ooncha banaaya gaya tha, taaki log inhen dur se dekh sake or jhum saken
 The voice of these artists was on the rise at the Prime Minister's rally
 gane bhi aise chune the, jinase josh paidaa ho sake
 The same artists were singing in the Congress meeting, but the aggressiveness of the songs was missing
 manch kaaphi neeche bana tha
 When i asked Balram Arya, he said that the political cultures of the two are different
 hamaara congress ke ummidavaar se lagaav to he, magar dil miltaa he bhaajapa se, isliye unki raily main gaate hue josh paidaa ho jaataa he
 In the context of these things, i began to remember what were the lyrics and expressions of songs sung in the Prime Minister's rally and what is being sung in the Congress rally
 vahaan 1857 kii kranti ke nayakon kaa gungan ho rahaa tha
 While recounting the martyrdom of Rani Laxmibai, energy comes naturally in this way
 saare geet vir ras ke the
 With the difference of the same singer and songs of the same background, you can see the body language of the leaders and supporters of Congress and BJP rallies
 congress kii raily main safed kurta to he, magar kurte kii chamak feeki pad gai he
 It seems that the worker is wearing a kurta from the previous day
 bhaajapa kii raily main kaaryakartaaon ko dekhakar laga ki unki jeet tay he, isliye sab nae nae kurte yaa dhule kurte main nazar aa rahe the
 Congress meetings were held in the name of simplicity with apathy, while BJP meetings were held in the name of energy
 congress ko jaldi hi reliyon ke aayojan ko gambhirtha se lenaa hoga
 There is nothing wrong in learning from the BJP in this matter
 bijepi ne jamini str par chunaav ladane kii ranneeti ko ram bharose nahin choda he
 He has laid siege to each and every voter
 jila se lekar block str par ranneetiyon ko chaak-chauband kar diya he
 Every worker has a job, a goal
 party modimay ho gai he, magar isi bahaane bijepi ek peshewar party bhi ho gai he
 Members of the IT cell of the BJP said that in Faridabad, phone numbers were taken from people by going door to door, going to parks
 hamane yahaan tak poocha ki esemes karenge to takalif to nahin hogi
 The sense of giving people numbers showed how much the front likes BJP
 bijepi main iti cell dikhaawati unit nahin he
 IT cell members said that earlier we used to inaugurate the IT cell itself, but this time when the 'war-room' was formed in Rohtak, 1,500 leader-workers came to the inauguration
 har bada netaa vahaan maujuud tha
 Go to any assembly of BJP, IT cell team is systematically engaged in campaigning
 congress kii sabha main mujhe koi mila hi nahin, jo iti kaa kaam kar rahaa ho
 Occasionally collide
 bhupendra hooda ne apane bhaashan kii shuruyaat hi is baat se kii ki chunaav he
 People from all parties will come, say their words
 sabaki suniye
 BJP leaders say don't listen to anyone else
 sirf bhaajapa ko suno or bhaajapa ko chuno
 It is fitting that Hooda took jokes in the style of the country, but in the speech, the Congress leaders are lagging behind
 kisi ko parajeet karne kaa udghosh nahin tha
 There was no power in the claim jahaan bijepi ke netaa lalkaarte hai, vahiin congressi puchkaarte hai

 trivedi ne ek netraheen vyakti kii gavaahi par yuvak kii hatya ke maamle main paanch logon ko umrakaid or chah-chah hajaar rupee jurmaane kii sajaa sunai he
 In this judgment, the court has also identified the blind eye Ramkishan, giving recognition of the accused and giving the witness a major basis
 vah mritak kaa bada bhai he
 According to the prosecution, on 20 January 09, the body of a Dalit Ganga Prasad resident of village Atralia under Biaora police station in the district was found in a pile of garbage behind a temple at Biaora
 police ne kaluram sen, bajesinh dangi, ramesh dangi, mukesh dangi tathaa dalit ramachandra nivasee ataralia ko hatya kaa aaropee banaaya tha
 During the testimony, the court blindly told Ramkishan, recognizing the voice of the accused, that his brother Gangaprasad was with him on the night of the incident
 isse spasht hua ki gangaaprasad ghatana kii raat aropiyon ke saath maujuud tha
 In this case, even before the court, the blind Ramkishan, recognizing the voice of the accused, confirmed his statement
 vishesh nyaayadhish ne sunaaye apane aadesh main aaropee kaluram sen, bajesinh dangi, ramesh dangi, mukesh dangi, tathaa dalit ramachandra ko umrakaid or chah-chah hajaar rupee ke jurmaane kii sajaa sunai he
 On November 17, it is announced that those who are married in their homes can withdraw Rs 2
5 lakh from their bank
 is khabar ke aate hi jinke gharon main shaadiyaan thim, wo bainkon kii taraf bhaage
 He also had to go through the same line which would have been longer, but everyone involved did not get the money
 jab shaadi ke ghar vaale card lekar manager tak pahunche, to kai jagahon par manager jawaab dene lage ki hamaare paas dene ke liye dhai lakh rupee nahin hai or is tarah se paise dene ke liye un tak guideline nahin pahunchi he
 How will anyone pay for the announcement on TV, unless written instructions reach the manager
 lihaaza niraash logon ko in khabaron or faislon par bhi shaq hua
 After being unsuccessful for 4 days, the Reserve Bank of India said on November 19 that banks should start giving this money from next week, when they will get the guideline
 21 november ko arabiai ne adhisuchana jari kar jo guideline bainkon ko bheji usase shaadi vaale gharon kii pareshaaniyaan or bad gai
 The first condition was that the people of the house married till 30 December can withdraw money, but can withdraw as much money as will be deposited in their account by 8 November
 yahi nahin duulhaa-dulhan ke maa-baap yaa khud duulhaa-dulhan paisa nikaalane bank jaayenge
 The groom and groom's families will be able to extract only two and a half lakhs
 jis kisi ne ye guideline banaai he wo lagata he ki bahut dinon se kisi shaadi main nahin gaya he, na hi uske yahaan kisi kii shaadi hui he
 But this is not possible
 shaadi vaale pariwaron kii samasya sirf puraane note badalane kii nahin he
 Whatever is stored has to be removed
 bilkul shaadi saadagi se honi chahie lekin kya yah faisla logon kaa hoga yaa notebandi se hoga
 If this is also the purpose of demonetisation, then it should be implemented in the next passion also
 jab tak yah nahin hota tab tak apane paise ko paanaa kisi kaa bhi adhikaar to he hi, chaahe wo kharch kare yaa na kare
 Not only this, marriage has its own economy
 kai tarah ke rojgaaron ko isse sahaayta milti he
 They all stalled
 rigerv bank kii guideline se agar duulhaa-dulhan bank kii line main ghanton khadey rahenge yaa unke mata-pita rahenge to baaki taiyaari kaa kaam koun dekhegaa
 Many people borrow for weddings, sell homes
 yah sab paisa kaise bank main jamaa hoga
 Even if someone electronically deposits it from America to Delhi account, that money will not be withdrawn
 sarkaar tay kar rahi he ki aap apane khate se kitna paisa nikaalenge, kyonki 86 pratishat noton kaa visthaapan nae noton se abhi tak hua nahin he
 The conditions train did not stop
 apana hi 2
 For evacuation of 5 lakhs, the advance will have to be given to the caterers, tents or marriage houses
 jiske ghar main shaadi he use halafanama jaisaa dena hoga ki unheen ko nagad raashi di gai he jinke paas bank khaataa nahin he
 Just like you will be able to give the florist out of this 2
5 lakh for decorating the pavilion only if he does not have a bank account
 iskaa ek matlab yah he ki agar phool vaale ke paas bank kaa khaataa hua to use check se dena hoga
 Not only this, the bank will have to maintain all the documents
 bhartiya reserve bank ne 22 november ko ek or circular jari kiya he
 The circular of November 21 is valid, only one thing has been added in it, that the person who has to give ten thousand or more cash, has to submit his name only in the bank
 bank waalon kaa kaam bhi kitna bad gaya he
 In this excuse, every manager must be seeing the truth of our society, it will be amazing
 ummid karata hum ki koi manager in anubhavon ko kalambaddh karegaa
 The sociologist should go around recording the marriages of how millions of weddings are happening in India at the moment
 dilli main to ek din main 25 se 30 hazaar shaadiyon hoti hai
 Now come to the problem of farmers
 vitt mantri ne bhi kaha he ki hamaara aglaa jor gramin kshetron par hoga, to ham bhi kisaanon par focus karte hai
 The month of November to December 15 is the sowing of the Rabi crop
 rabi main mukhya fasal gehun kii he
 But according to the region, people also sow barley, gram, potato and lentils during the Rabi season
 is dauraan sirf beej hi nahin, khaad kii bhi zarurat hoti he
 For this, farmers sell old paddy and repay the old loan and take a new loan
 notebandi ke kaaran kisaan kooparative bank se beej, khaad or dawa nahin kharid sakate or na hi lone le sakate hai
 The District Cooperative Bank and Primary Agricultural Credit Society are prohibited from exchanging, depositing and withdrawing notes
 inke paas nae note hi nahin he to nikaalane par kahaan se paise denge
 Urban cooperative banks are also complaining of shortage of notes
 kooparative bank sirf bank nahin, balki dawa, khaad or beej kii dukaan kaa bhi kaam karte hai
 Cooperative banks are the lifeline of farmers
 mumbai zila sahakaari bank ne hoicourt main yachika daayar kii he ki rigerv bank ne manamaane tareeke se zila sahakaari bainkon ko is prakriya se baahar kar diya he
 The sowing time is till December 15, so the government and the farmer still have a week or two to do something
 bahut deree hogi to gehun kii paidaavaar to bad jaaegi magar quality kharaab ho jaaegi
 The Reserve Bank has said that the District Cooperative Bank and PACS should tell the farmers that they can withdraw Rs 24,000 every week from their accounts, but these banks complain that they are not getting the notes
 nae noton kii kami yaa adla badali kii anumati na hone ke kaaran kisaanon par kya asar padaa he, yah jaanane ke liye hamane ghaziabad zila sahakaari bank ke kuch logon se baat kii
 This bank has 33 branches in two-three districts and three and a half lakh farmers are its members
 Ghaziabad has received only 4 crores from different banks
 nayaa note paryaapt nahin mil rahaa he
 The figures of 29 branches show that so far only 1 crore 34 lakh loan has been distributed, whereas between 8 and 22 November last year, loan of 4 crore 44 lakh was distributed
 sirf 6400 hazaar kisaanon ko rabi kii kheti ke liye karz mila he
 About three lakh farmers have not received money
 sirf kheti hi nahin, kisaanon kaa baaki jivan bhi prabhavit hua he
 Apart from treatment, marriage, school fees, they also buy fodder for cattle and purchase cake
 unki dawa-daaru bhi hoti he, aadmi kii to hoti hi he
 Everyone is waiting that the government will take some decision about cooperative banks and give relief
 ek bank manager ne bataaya ki sarkaar ko khaad ke liye kuch karnaa chahie
 They suggest that a new account can be banned from opening
 puraane khate main jamaa karne or nikaalane kii raashi tay kii ja sakati he
 The government ruled on Monday that the farmer can use old notes to buy seeds from the Central and State Government seed centers, agricultural universities
 is raahat se bhi kisaanon ko raahat nahin hui he, kyonki sarkaar kaa yah faisla shaadi ke faisle kii tarah sabhi beej bikri kendron par nahin pahunchaa he
 Exemption is also awaiting regarding manure
 hamaare sahyogi dhananjay ne maharashtra ke akola zile ke akot tehsil se ek kharid bikri centre kaa haal pataa kiya
 Shaligram Kale of the Purchase Center said that the information of the government's decision has not reached them in writing, so they are not giving seeds in exchange for old notes
 shaaligram ji aktubar maheene main hi gehun ke saath quintal beej lekar aae the lekin 22 november tak sirf 10 quinter beej hi bech paae hai
 Since November 8, there has been a business of 10,000 at his shop, whereas till now business of 50 to 60 thousand used to be done
 ek bori main 40 kilo gehun ke beej hote hai
 The price is 1400 rupees
 beej ke saath 50 kilo diapi khaad bhi lagata he jisaki keemat he 1160 rupee
 The Maharashtra Seed Corporation had supplied the seeds to its dealers in the month of October itself, but the dealers are not able to sell after November 8
 maharashtra main 4500 se 5000 adhikrut dealer hai
 On 22nd, there was some business with the new note
 hamaare sahyogi manish kumaar bihar ke purniya or farbishganj main khaad kii dukaan par gaye
 Private shopkeepers cannot sell manure in exchange of old notes, only government shops
 wo bhi beej ke liye
 We will also know the condition of the farmers of Rajasthan, but first tell the condition of the potato market in Agra
 aalu ke teen prakaar hote hai
 There is a very small size potato called Baby Potato and Splinter
 usase thodaa sa bada aalu gulla aalu kehalaata he
 These two are used in the form of seeds and potato is sown in the month of November
 aalu kisaan vyapaariyon kaa kahana he ki aalu kii is verieti kii keemat puri tarah se krash kar gai he
 Traders said that two months ago a 50 kg potato sack was being sold here for Rs 800
 7 nambevar tak 700 se 750 rupee bori kaa bhav tha
 After the demonetisation of November 8, Aloo Mandi was brought up for a week
 uske baad rate sanbhala hi nahin
 Depending on the quality, the big potato is selling for between Rs 350 and Rs 500
 agra mandi se har din dakshin bharat or maharashtra kii ore 500 trek nikalate the lekin ab inaki sankhya mushkil se 100-150 rah gai he
 Orders are being canceled from many places
 ek kisaan ne bataaya ki 480 bori aalu lod kar kanpur bheja lekin kanpur main aalu itnaa kam bika ki vyapaaree ne 9032 rupee hi diye
 If he had given the pre-demonetisation rate, the farmer would have got Rs 2
5 lakh
 isamen se wo store kaa 50,000 kiraaya chukaata
 But now he will have to face terrible losses
 yani aalu ke kisaanon ko ek trek par dedh se do lakh kaa ghaataa hua he
 The experience of each farmer is different but the problems of farmers are also different
 kai mandiyon main kisaanon ko sabzi vagairah kam daam par bechni pad rahi he
 Our colleague Saurabh Shukla went to Azadpur Mandi in Delhi
 kai sabziyon ke daam gir gaye hai
 It is expected that its benefits will be reaching the consumers, but if the farmer does not get the expenses, then he will not be able to take advantage of this good monsoon
 is baar monsoon acha rahaa he or kisaan munaafe kii aas main the
 Saurav was told by a farmer that he had come from Fatehabad, 250 km away

 Our colleague Dhananjay discovered the condition of a purchase and sale center from Akot Tehsil in Akola district, Maharashtra

 maharashtra beej nigam ne to aktubar ke maheene main hi apane dealron ko beej kii supplai kar di thi lekin dealer 8 november ke baad nahin bech paa rahe hai
 There are 4500 to 5000 authorized dealers in Maharashtra

 Our colleague Manish Kumar went to a fertilizer shop in Purnia and Farbisganj in Bihar
 privet dukandaar puraane noton ke badale khaad nahin bech saktaa he, sirf sarkari dukaan hi le sakate hai
 That too for seed
 ham rajasthan ke kisaanon kaa bhi haal janenge lekin pehle bataate hai agra kii aalu mandi kaa haal
 There are three types of potato
 ek bahut chote aakaar kaa aalu hota he jise baby pateto or kirch kehete hai
 a little bigger than that is called Gulla Aloo
 in donon kaa istamaal beej ke rup main hota he or isi november maheene main aalu kii buvaai hoti he
 Potato farmer traders say that the price of this variety of potatoes has completely crashed
 vyapaariyon ne bataaya ki do maheene pehle yahaan 50 kilo aalu kii bori 800 rupee main bik rahi thi
 700 to 750 rupees was the price of the sack till 7 no
 8 november kii notebandi ke baad ek hafte tak aalu mandi ko paala maar gaya
 After that, the rate is not stable
 quality ke hisaab se bada aalu 350 se 500 rupee bori ke bich bik rahaa he
 Every day, 500 trucks used to go from Agra Mandi towards South India and Maharashtra, but now their number is hardly 100-150
 bahut jagahon se order cancel ho rahe hai
 a farmer told that after loading 480 bags of potatoes, he sent them to Kanpur, but the potatoes sold so little in Kanpur that the merchant paid only 9032 rupees
 agar wo notebandi se pehle ke rate se detaa to kisaan ko dhai lakh rupee milte
 Out of this he paid 50,000 rent of the store
 magar ab use bhayankar ghate kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 That is, potato farmers have suffered a loss of one and a half to two lakhs on a truck
 har kisaan kaa anubhav alag he magar kisaanon kii pareshaani bhi alag-alag he
 In many mandis, farmers have to sell vegetables at low prices

 Prices of many vegetables have fallen
 ummid he upabhoktaaon tak iskaa laabh pahunch rahaa hoga lekin kisaan kaa kharchaa nahin nikalegaa to wo is achche monsoon kaa laabh nahin uthaa sakegaa

 Is a producer of brinjal
 notebandi se pehle wo 40 kilo kii apni bori 500 se 600 rupee main bechata tha, lekin 22 november ko wo 100 se 150 rupee main bech kar gaya wo bhi udhaar
 That is, this farmer lost about four hundred on a sack
 kisaan kaa kahana tha ki aane jane kaa haada bhi nahin niklaa he
 The price of green vegetables has been affected

 He said how to harvest or change the note
 tippaniyan How will the farmers be compensated for the loss
 isliye unka sankat sirf beej kaa sankat nahin he
 If we could calculate these losses of farmers in some way, then it would have been known that this number would have been several thousand crores or lakh crores
 kisaanon ko sarkaar se ummid he
 In rural areas, there is a problem of cash in banks, but also in cities, the money in banks is running out quickly
 hamen yah bhi dekhnaa hoga ki agar ek kisaan ko pachaas hazaar se lakh do lakh kaa nuksaan hua to usase wo kitne dinon main ubar paaegaa
 What will be the burden on the debt
 himanshu shekhar bataa rahe hai ki aate ke daam ke baad daalon kii keemat bhi bad gai he
 Chana pulses have become expensive by Rs 38 in Rewa and Rs 37 in Shillong and 25 rupees per kg in Bathinda
 guuruuvaar se big bazaar ke outlet se 2000 tak aap nikaal sakate hai
 The stress of not getting money due to demonetisation is turning into depression and the news is coming out from some places to suicide

 The police have registered a case against bank personnel for their negligence in this case

 This bank has 33 branches in two-three districts and three and a half lakh farmers are its members
 Ghaziabad has received only 4 crores from different banks

 The figures of 29 branches show that so far only 1 crore 34 lakh loan has been distributed, whereas between 8 and 22 November last year, loan of 4 crore 44 lakh was distributed

 ek bank manager ne bataaya ki sarkaar ko khaad ke liye kuch karnaa chahie
 They suggest that a new account can be banned from opening
 puraane khate main jamaa karne or nikaalane kii raashi tay kii ja sakati he
 The government ruled on Monday that the farmer can use old notes to buy seeds from the Central and State Government seed centers, agricultural universities
 is raahat se bhi kisaanon ko raahat nahin hui he, kyonki sarkaar kaa yah faisla shaadi ke faisle kii tarah sabhi beej bikri kendron par nahin pahunchaa he
 Exemption is also awaiting regarding manure
 hamaare sahyogi dhananjay ne maharashtra ke akola zile ke akot tehsil se ek kharid bikri centre kaa haal pataa kiya
 Shaligram Kale of the Purchase Center said that the information of the government's decision has not reached them in writing, so they are not giving seeds in exchange for old notes

 Traders said that two months ago a 50 kg potato sack was being sold here for Rs 800
 7 nambevar tak 700 se 750 rupee bori kaa bhav tha
 After the demonetisation of November 8, Aloo Mandi was brought up for a week

 Farmers are expected from the government
