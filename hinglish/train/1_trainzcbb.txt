 madhyapradesh or maharashtra ke baad ab punjab ke kisaan bhi karjamaafee ke mudde par ekajute hona shuru ho gaye hai
 The farmers of the state are preparing to start a movement on the issue of debt waiver
 bhartiya kisaan union ke punjab adhyaksh balbir singh rajeval guuruuvaar ko chandigarh main kisaan netaaon ke saath ekajute hue or in logon ne meeting karke ye tay kiya ki 10 june ko desh ke duusare kisaan sanghathanon ke saath ek meeting dilli main kii jaaegi
 After this, a movement can be started in Punjab from June 12 on the issue of debt waiver of farmers
 captain ne kiya tha vaadabharatiya kisaan union (rajeval group) ke adhyaksh balbir singh rajeval ne kaha ki captain amarinder singh ne vidhansabha chunaav prachaar ke dauraan kisaanon se vaada kiya tha ki pradesh main congress kii sarkaar banane par kisaanon ke karj maaf kiye jaaenge, lekin sarkaar banane ke baad captain amarinder singh apane vaayade ko bhul gaye hai or pradesh kii kharaab arthvyavastha kii daleel de rahe hai
 Farmer leaders questioned whether Captain Amarinder Singh was not aware of the promise of loan waiver from farmers, which he promised to farmers at that time with debt waiver
 Balbir Singh Rajewal said that if the Punjab government did not make any big announcement about the debt waiver of farmers in the coming assembly session, then the farmers of Punjab would start a big movement like Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra
 puure desh main jahaan kisaanon kii karjamaafee or aatmahatyaon ke mudde ko lekar haahaakaar machaa he, punjab bhi isse achoota nahin he
 It has been more than 2 months since Congress formed the government in Punjab and around 60 farmers have given their lives due to debt burden
 buudhvaar ko chandigarh main hui punjab cabinet kii baithak main bhi kisaanon kii karjamaafee kaa mudda uthaa or captain sarkaar ke mantriyon ne ye rasta khojane kii koshish kii ki pehle se hi baari karj main dubi punjab sarkaar kis tarah se kisaanon ko karjamaafee kaa tohfa dekhakar raahat de sakati he
 The case of increasing suicide killings of farmers in Punjab has now become a major political issue
 punjab vidhansabha chunaav prachaar ke dauraan congress ne kisaanon ko bharosa diya tha ki pradesh main sarkaar banane ke baad unke karj maaf kar die jaaenge or iske liye baqayada unhen form bhi bharkar die gaye the, lekin satta main aane ke baad philhal congress abhi kisaanon se thodaa or vakt maang rahi he or aane vaale bajet satr main kisaanon ke karj maafee ko lekar koi bada elaan karne kii baat kah rahi he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has dominated the ruling Congress for not fulfilling the promise of farmers' suicide and debt waiver in the field
 aam aadmi party ke netaa vipaksh ech es phulka ne kaha ki wo punjab vidhansabha ke spikar ko likh chuke hai ki kisaanon ke badhate aatmahatya ke maamalon ko lekar ek vishesh vidhansabha satr bulaai jaae or aisa na hua to aane vaale bajet satr ke dauraan kisaanon kii badhati aatmahatyaon ke maamalon ko aam aadmi party vidhansabha main uthaaegi
 Congress government is on target of opponents for not fulfilling the promises
 aise main punjab cabinet ke bade chehre logon ko bas yahi bharosa de rahe hai ki wo thodaa vakt intjaar karen, captain amarinder singh ne chunaav prachaar ke dauraan jo vaayade kiye the, unhen jald hi puraa kiya jayega
 If the Punjab government did not make a big announcement about the debt waiver of farmers in the budget session, then it is possible that a big movement like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh will also stand in Punjab, because the farmers of Punjab are also suffering from debt and the days of farmers There are reports of suicides
 bhopal main pradesh congress ke mukhya pravaktaa keke mishra ne aarope lagaaya ki yuvati ne yah kadam isliye uthaaya kyonki girijesh pratap singh duusari shaadi karne ja rahe the

 Post ️🍾🎉🎂A post shared bychris pratt (@prattprattpratt) ondec 13, 2018 at 5:32 pm pstview this post on instagramhere are twin Suffolk lambs, "blackbelt" and "quicksilver
 ” These Suffolk Sheep descended from a nearly wild breed of Island Sheep, over three human family generations and dozens and dozens of lamb generations, becoming incredibly hardy
 Before coming to our farm the entire herd gave birth in the fields with no veterinary help whatsoever
 With no man made shelter, no medicine, no hoof trimming and no supplemented nutrients only the strongest survived
 The result is an incredibly athletic, wild and unusually hardy sheep, which when full grown can easily jump a 5 foot fence
 Ask me how i know! One of them jumped head first into my chest at a full run and nearly knocked the wind out of me
 i was brought back to my days as an all area inside linebacker
 Point being, i was an all area inside linebacker
 Nonetheless, we've had many unique challenges trying to domesticate these wild little Suffolk
 But it’s working! Amazingly mama didn’t mind as we picked up her babies
 Our hope is in a couple generations they will become as calm and fearless as the other domesticated breeds

 No one came to save the crowd
 chaatra ne apane parijanon ke saath nolej park thane main aropiyon ke khilaaf likhit shikaayat darj karai he
 Noida and Greater Noida adjoining Delhi are getting stronger day after day by miscreants
 alam yah he ki badmaash ek ke baad ek lut kii vaardaaton ko anjaam dekar faraar ho jate hai or police karrwai karne kii baat kahkar apana pallaa jhaad leti he
 Greater Noida a student doing btech from NIET College, came to Greater Noida from Noida

 When the student protested, the miscreants pushed the girl and dropped her on the ground
 chaatra himmat dikhaate hue bike savaar donon badmaashon se bhid gai
 The miscreants again dropped the girl to the ground with the help of weapons and escaped
 peedit chaatra kavita kaa kahana he ki jis samay badmaash vaardaat ko anjaam de rahe the, us samay vahaan par kai log bhi maujuud the lekin kisi ne bhi uski madad nahin kii
 The victim student has informed the knowledge park police of the incident with her

 When the newspaper opened in the morning, a paper fell off
 banaras loksabhaa seat se bijepi ke ummidavaar narendra modi kaa parchaa
 It details the work done by the Modi government for the welfare of farmers in Gujarat
 madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh kii bijepi sarkaron dwaara kisaanon ke kalyaan ke liye uthaae gaye kadamon kaa zikr he
 Finally the appeal to the people of Benaras is "don't forget voting day, lotus sign and number three!" darasal, banaras chunaav main iviem par narendra modi kaa naam tisare number par he
 That is why BJP is telling voters about their names, order on evms and election symbol
 parche ke aakhir main kram sankhya 3 ke saath narendra modi kaa naam or camel nishaan ke saath photo diya gaya he, taaki votaron ko pahchaanane main aasaani ho
 Although Modi's name may be at number three on EVM, but on the day of counting, number will remain at number one, there is little doubt in the minds of people about this
 narendra modi ne banaras shahar main sirf do din prachaar kiya he
 Traveling by car for the first time on April 24 and second time on May 8 at Rohania in the election meeting and on the same day from BHU to the BJP Election Office at Rath Yatra intersection
 jise road sho kaa naam nahin diya gaya, lekin tha vah road sho hi
 On the last day of campaigning, Rahul Gandhi did a road show in favor of Congress candidate Ajay Rai in Banaras, while Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav did a road show in favor of Samajwadi Party candidate Kailash Chaurasia
 aam aadmi party ke pramukh arvind kejariwal 9 taarikh ko road sho kar chuke the
 Bahujan Samaj Party candidates are campaigning in rural areas
 lekin baaki tamaam dalon main ladaai doosraa-teesraa yaa chauthaa number hasil karne kii he
 The highest reputation is at stake with Arvind Kejriwal, who has kept his only goal in this Lok Sabha election to defeat Narendra Modi
 kejariwal kii koshish he kisi tarah se duusare number par aane kii, lekin sthaneey congressi vidhayak ajay raay isamen aage dikh rahe hai
 Rahul's roadshow has also encouraged Ajay Rai
 aam aadmi party ke samarthakon kaa daawa tha ki shahar ke teen lakh musalmaan ekamusth kejariwal ke paksh main hai or ajay raay ko samarthan dene kii mukhtaar ansaari kii apil kaa un par asar nahin hua he, jabaki hakeekat main aisa he nahin
 a large proportion of Muslim voters are in favor of Congress, while the remaining votes are divided between Aam Aadmi Party and Samajwadi Party
 sapa ummidavaar chaurasia ko rajya main party kii sarkaar hone kaa phayda bhi mil rahaa he
 Due to the controversy of local DM Pranjal Yadav and his development work in the city, he has more attraction towards Samajwadi Party than Kejriwal among the anti-modi voters
 lekin garib tabake or kuch gramin ilaakon main jabardast prachaar kaa phayda kejariwal ko mila he
 Therefore, the battle of numbers two-three and four is between these three candidates
 jahaan tak bijepi kaa sawaal he, uski koshish modi ko badi jeet dilaane kii he
 In the last election, Murli Manohar Joshi had barely won by nearly 17 thousand votes
 bijepi kaa lakshya he ki modi banaras main vadodara se bhi zyada voton se jite
 Party President Rajnath Singh has indicated that in the event of winning from both the seats, Modi will retain the Benaras seat
 bijepi kii koshish he ki matdaan zyada ho, taaki jeet kaa faasla bad sake
 The party is telling Banaras that they will vote for MP, but they will also get PM
 yani by van, get van free! BJP gave a new twist to the case of Minister of State Niranjan Jyoti in the Narendra Modi cabinet
 centre main mantri or rajyasabha saansad mukhtaar abbaas nakvi kii aguwai main bijepi saansadon ne sansad parisar main lagi gandhi murti ke saamne jaakar pradarshan kiya
 Naqvi alleged that the opposition is overthrowing Sadhvi's case because the minister is from the Dalit community
 isse pehle vipaksh kii maang par pradhanmantri ne aaj loksabhaa main is mudde par apana bayaan diya
 Referring to the social and economic background of Niranjan Jyoti, he appealed to the House to forgive him
 yah bhi kaha ki vah nai hai or varishthajan udaartaa dikhaaen
 The opposition was not satisfied with the Prime Minister's statement
 pramukh vipakshi dal ke netaa mallikarjun khadge ne kaha ki maamla kisi vyakti ke khilaaf yaa uski saamaajik haisiyat kii vajah se nahin uthaaya gaya he, balki samvidhan kii shapath liye ek mantri kii aapattijanak bhashaa kii vajah se uthaaya gaya he
 And the opposition wants to see what action it takes
 spikar kii taraf se kaha gaya ki pradhanmantri ke bayaan kii vipaksh kii maang bhi puri kar ho gai he or ab yah maamla khatm ho gaya, lekin vipaksh loksabhaa se walkout kar gaya
 Actually the opposition is not willing to accept the resignation of Minister Niranjan Jyoti
 sansad kii kaarywahi chaar dinon se baadhit ho rahi he
 On Thursday, parties like Congress, TMC, SP, AAP, CPM, RSP, JDU came together on this issue
 aaj gandhi murti ke saamne congress or tiemasi ke saansadon ne munh par kaali pattee baandhakar pradarshan kiya
 mps also tied black bars within the Lok Sabha

 The films are called Mirrors of Reality
 bhartiya cinemaamen kai filmein aisi rahi hai jinhone vaastavik kahaniyon ko badi khubsuurati se parde par parosa he
 Such films are still made today
 fark sirf itnaa he ki aaj bada bajet, mordan takanic or upyukt sansaadhan hote hai
 Whereas, in old films, directors and actors used to do wonders with very limited resources
 us vakt majboot script, acha abhinay or nirdesan kaushal hi film ko kaamyaab banane kaa mukhya tarika hua karte the
 One such successful film was Dharmendra and Balraj Sahni starrer film Haqiqat, released in 1964

 It is talked about when India was freed from years of slavery and the wounds inflicted by the British for years were fresh on the hearts of Indians
 desh kaa aadharbhoot dhaancha bahut majboot nahin tha
 The financial condition was bad and people did not even have food and drink
 sena bhi in halaaton se achhuti nahin thi
 But despite this, the spirit of patriotism was such that without proper weapons and basic resources, the soldiers clashed at the border to protect the country
 desh kii uttar purvi seemaa par behad vipareet mausam tha, lekin baavjood iske sansaadhanheen bhartiya jawan peeche nahin hate
 They had no clothes, no ammunition, but they had such patriotic spirit that thousands of soldiers continued to fight at the border with the help of a rifle knife
 tamaam jawan shahid hue
 This was the period when the women of the country gave up their mangalsutras to help the Prime Minister's War Fund
 javaanon kii shahadat kii is kahani ko dekhne vaala har bhartiya cinemahol se rokar niklaa tha

 congress kaa kahana tha ki modi sarkaar ne agasta westland ko blaclist main se hataa diya he, jabaki bhaajapa ne congress ke is daawey ko nakaara he

 Let us know that on Sunday, Randeep Surjewala had said in a press conference that the agustawestland was blacklisted by the UPA government in 2013
 usee company ko 2014 main modi sarkaar ne white list main daal diya tha
 Surjewala said that on August 22, 2014, the NDA government pulled Augusta Westland out of the black list

 jaradaari ne iskaa jawaab diya, lekin chaar saal baad beete 12 june ko sarkaar ne ek real estate kaarobaari ko chif justise par hamalaa karne ke liye taiyaar kiya
 58-year-old Malik Riaz Hussain, sitting 12th in the list of rich people in Pakistan, claimed that he gave 34 to Chaudhary's son Arsalan in return for a court ruling in his favor

 But Zardari's friend Mian Amir Mehmood's off-air conversation at the studio of the Urdu TV channel World News leaked abruptly, revealing that Chaudhary was charged with a conspiracy
 duniya special main riyaj se poochtacha ko dikhaaya janaa tha jiske mejabaan the pakistan ke do bade tivi anker mubashir lukaman or meher bukhari
 Instead of questioning the anchors, along with Riyaz, tried to discredit Chaudhary and his son
 lukaman ne phone par kisi se baat kii jise unhone pradhanmantri gilaani kaa betaa or punjab assembly kaa sadsy, 31 varshiya abdul kaadir gilaani bataaya
 Riyaz instigated a rough question, while an anchor objected to it

 He said, "but i want to
 
 
 '' unhone jor dekar kaha, ''main ise saamne laana chahta hum taaki chif justise tak baat ko le ja sakuun

 On 19 June, Chaudhary played a reversal and the first judicial coup in the history of Pakistan
 chif justise ne pradhanmantri gilaani ko is aarope main barkhaast kar diya ki ve bhrashtachar ke aaropon se ghire raashtrapati kaa bachaav kar rahe the
 Once again Pakistan was engulfed in a new political crisis
 uske liye isse bura vakt nahin ho saktaa tha
 The administrative structure in Pakistan has collapsed
 chilchilaati garmi main 20 ghante kii bijli katautee ne pakistaniyon ko sadakon par laa diya he
 Basic services have collapsed
 gujranvala, faisalabad, kasoor, sargodha or okara main hinsak pradarshan ho rahe hai
 The protesters have clashed with the police
 unhone thanon par hamalaa kar use tahas-nahas kiya he, sthaneey bijli board ke daftaron main aag laga di he or rajmargon ko jam kar diya he
 On 18 June, protesters attacked the house of a National Assembly member of the PPP
 thik usee din pradarshnakariyon ne lahore-sialkot sawari train kii teen bogiyon main gujranvala stesan par aag laga di
 Foreign investment is absent, the economy is crawling at an annual growth rate of 3 per cent and the money that is coming is coming from the illegal routes of opium and gunpowder
 neshnal assembly ke ek sadsy kehete hai, ''nakad sirf pakhtunon ke paas he jinka opium ke dhandhe or afghanistan kii seemaa par landi kotal main lagane vaale hathiyaaron ke bazaar par kabja he
 "corruption is unprecedented - according to Transparency International's list released in 2011, Pakistan is ranked 134 in the list of 183 countries
 islamabad ko sabase zyada madad or paise dene vaale washington ke saath bhi rishte sankat main hai
 US efforts to persuade Pakistan to reopen supply routes in Afghanistan have failed because Pakistan is demanding $ 5,000 from the US on every truck going to Afghanistan, while it is willing to pay only $ 250 per truck
 yah maarg november main america helicopter dwaara galati se kiye gaye ek hamale ke baad se band padaa he
 24 Pakistani soldiers were killed in that attack

 Karachi, the largest city, has become an arena for racial riots, where more than 2,000 people have been killed since 2011
 duusari jagahon par kattarpanthi pehle se hi kam ho rahe udaar logon par kahar dha rahe hai
 The only relief for Zardari was that his son, 23-year-old Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, topped the Oxford Dissertation
 yah baat alag he ki agar jaradaari kii naakaamiyon par kisi ko number dena ho, to ve fail ho jaaenge
 The four pillars of democracy in Pakistan have pitted against each other
 karypalika or nyaaypalika ek-duusare ko puri tarah tabah karne par tuli hui hai
 The credibility of the media that people viewed as the ultimate relief against the rise of fundamentalism has also been eroded by the fear of attacks
 kaam karne kii sajaa patrakaron ko yah mili he ki 2000 ke baad se ab tak 39 patrkaar maare ja chuke hai
 Those who are left are doomed to sell - "riyaz says to Lukman of Air," Can you get me the same bungalow as Hamid Mir did? "this time the irony is that of elected governments The Pakistani army, notorious for the coup, is nowhere in the current crisis

 On 26 April, the Chief Justice awarded him a symbolic sentence for contempt of court - "he was sentenced to 30 seconds in prison
" ab unke jane ke baad nyaaypalika ke nishane par jaradaari hai
 Ahmed Rashid, who wrote a book called Pakistan on the Brink, estimates that there is still a more dangerous conflict between the court and Zardari over the letter scandal (memogate)
 america main pakistan ke rajdoot rahe hossain hakkaani ne kathith taur par jaradaari ke kehane par hi pakistani fouj kii nakwl kasne kii guhaar america se lagaai thi
 Says Ahmed, "now the case is in the court of the Supreme Court and in the coming weeks, the trial may start
" yadi aisa hota he to mulk se gaddari ke iljaam main jaradaari or duusare netaaon ko mujrim qaraar diya ja saktaa he
 It will be good for everyone to avoid this situation and to get the election done soon can bring Pakistan back on track
 ''jaradaari jab tak raashtrapati hai, unke sir par samvidhan ke anuchhed 248 kaa saaya he
 The Supreme Court under the leadership of Chaudhary has put pressure on the government to open several corruption cases against Zardari since 2009, with two major cases involving money fraud and bribery
 pakistan kii ek adaalat ne 1999 main jaradaari or unki bivi benazir bhutto ko paanch saal kaid kii sajaa sunai thi
 Bhutto was in exile in London at the time and was found guilty of taking bribes from a Swiss firm during his second prime ministerial term
 iske baad 2003 main ek swiss adaalat ne jaradaari, bhutto or unki maa nusrat bhutto ko pakistan sarkaar ke saath kaarobaar karne vaali swiss fermon se 1
 He was convicted for taking bribe of $ 19 million and misusing Swiss bank accounts for this
 beeti 10 janvari ko adaalat ne gilaani par aarope lagaaya ki ve ''izzatmab shaks'' nahin hai kyonki unhone jaradaari ke khilaaf maamalon ko dobaaraa kholane ke liye swiss adhikariyon ko khat likhane se inkaar kar diya he
 Till date, Zardari could not get his wife's slayer punished and because of all this, he has made his fame known
 ve lagaataar is maamle par apane kadam peeche khinchate rahe or samay-samay par apni siyaasi jindagi bachaane ke liye kisi-na-kisi vafaadaar kii qurbaani dete rahe hai
 His old loyalist Haqqani was first removed as US ambassador in November 2011
 is saal janvari main jab gilaani ne fouj par iljaam lagaaya ki usne memoget main supreme court ke saamne gavaahi dekar samvidhan kaa ulanghan kiya he, to nyaaypalika fouj ke saath khadi ho gai
 Zardari pledged to give relief to both of them that they could sacrifice their prime minister
 yahi vajah he ki unhone gilaani ko barkhaast kiye jane kaa ab tak virodh nahin kiya
 Instead, a day later, the PPP jointly selected 65-year-old Makhdoom Shahabuddin as the next prime minister with his biggest ally PML (Q)
 shahabuddin dakshini punjab ke pipipi netaa hai
 But later the PPP leaders understood that Shahabuddin's name would not be liked by the Chief Justice because in 2011, Chaudhary ordered Pakistan's anti-narcotics Force to interrogate Shahabuddin in custody
 shahabuddin ne 2009 main swasthya mantri rahete hue nau ton effidreen ke aayaat ko manjuuri di thi
 The drug was imported by two pharma companies
 effidreen kaa istemaal sardi-khaansee kii dawaaon main to hota hi he, ise heroin ko shuddh banane ke kaam main bhi laayaa jaataa he
 On June 21, a court issued a non-bailable arrest warrant against him in the same case
 pipipi ne shahabuddin ke is record ko dekhte hue raja parvej ashraf ke naam par mohar laga di or unhen pradhanmantri pad ke liye apana ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya
 However, there is a case against Ashraf in the Supreme Court
 haal tak pakistan kaa teji se ubharta media 15 channelon kii aguwai main supreme court ke bhrashtachar virdohi muhim ke peeche khadaa tha, lekin tivi par choudhary par jhootha aarope gadhe jane kii ghatana ne dikhaa diya he ki pakistan main patrakarita bhi bik chuki he
 On 15 June, all 16 judges of the Supreme Court watched the Riyaz video
 unhone sanvaadon par ghor aapatti jataate hue do nyaayadhishon kii ek cameti bana di, jiskaa kaam channel ke khilaaf avmaananaa kii karrwai karne kii sambhaavnaaen talashna tha
 The credit for this decision went to Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf chief Imran Khan
 unhone india today ko bataaya, ''hamaari party dwaara daayar yachika ke baad hi supreme court ne pradhanmantri ko barkhaast karne kaa faisla kiya he
 The judiciary has done a huge job and we cannot allow it to be overturned '(see box)
 ho saktaa he ki jaradaari kii sarkaar pakistan main kaarykaal puraa karne vaali vahaan kii pehali sarkaar ban jaae, lekin raashtrapati ke laalach or naakabiliyat ne yah tay kar diya he ki log unhen dobaaraa mauka nahin denge

 pichley 24 ghante main bihar main satta kaa sameekaran badal chukaa he
 Big brother-younger brother Lalu and Nitish have broken up and now nitish-modi friendship is common
 nitish phir se endie ke paale main hai or istife ke 15 ghante ke bheetar dobaaraa satta sanbhaalane ja rahe hai
 If Lalu termed it a betrayal by Nitish and a fixed match between BJP and JDU, the BJP formed the Natural Alliance
 lekin aakhir itnaa tej ghatnakram kaise hua
 Sushil Modi was one of the most talked about characters in this whole matter
 susheel modi ne lagaataar khulaason se bhrashtachar ke maamle par lalu kunbe ko gher liya or baad main sibiai or idi ke chhaapon ke baad nitish ko majaboor hokar argedy se gathbandhan todna padaa
 Let us see how little Modi carried out the mission NDA in Bihar
 tejasvi par kiye tabadatod khulaasebihar bijepi ke netaa susheel modi ne isi saal 4 april ko lalu parivaar ke bade bete tej pratap yadav par mitti ghotaale kaa pehla aarope lagaaya
 After this, Sushil Modi continued to crack corruption bombs one by one on Lalu Yadav and his family
 tejasvi, tejpratap, misa bharti, raagini yadav, rabari devi or lalu ko lekar lagaataar susheel modi ne khulaase kiye
 He also approached the agencies regarding these disclosures
 lalu parivaar ke yahaan sibiai or idi ke chaape pade or phir nitish ko lalu se alag hona padaa
 Sushil Modi's revelations over the Lalu family put RJD on the backfoot
 lalu family ko karodon ke free gift par gherasushil modi ne pichley kuch saalon main lalu parivaar ko karodon ke free gift ko lekar bhi gheraa
 It questioned the transaction of several properties in the name of Tejashwi
 susheel modi ke anusaar, upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav or unke bhai va swasthya mantri tejpratap kii khud or unke parivaar kii ek hajaar karod se zyada kii benami sampattiyaan hai
 Why did party leader Premchand Gupta name the land of Lalu's sons, on which Mal was created
 iske alaava tejasvi or tejpratap ko chachaa or naanaa se bhi karodon ke uphaar mili, jo jaanch ke daayre main hai
 Lalu's daughter Hema Yadav and wife Rabri Devi were donated land worth about one crore rupees in 2014 by their servant Lalan Chaudhary
 lalan ke naam se bipiel card bhi bana hua he
 These too came under scrutiny
 kanoon vyavastha ke maamle par bhi gheraabihar main bade aparaadh ke maamalon ko bhi susheel modi ne lagaataar uthaaya
 Sushil Modi directly surrounded the RJD on cases of murder, kidnapping, robbery in various districts
 nitish sarkaar par hamalaa karte vakt susheel modi ye bataate kabhi nahin bhuule ki jangalraj kii vaapasi lalu ke satta main aane ke kaaran hua or pichley kaal main jab nitish ke saath bijepi thi tab halaat kuch or the
 a good rapport with Nitish Modi was also deputy CM with Nitish in the previous NDA government and now he is returning to the post
 nitish ke saath unka talmail kaaphi acha mana jaataa he
 While raising the issue of Jungle Raj in Bihar, Sushil Modi kept in mind that there was no harm to Nitish's image
 susheel modi ne ek taraf lalu kunbe ko nishane par liya to vahiin nitish ko ofer bhi diya ki agar ve lalu kaa saath chhodkar aate hai to unhen samarthan ke liye bijepi taiyaar he
 On Wednesday, when Nitish announced his separation from Lalu, within a few minutes the BJP became active from Patna to Delhi and within a few minutes, support was announced
 susheel modi se kya siikhnaa chahie vipaksh ko?aise vakt main jab desh kii raajnneeti modi ke irdagird focus hokar rah gai he aise main susheel modi kaa abhiyaan vipakshi raajnneeti ke liye ek bada sabak sabit ho saktaa he
 It was only after Bihar lost elections in 2015 that Sushil Modi announced the end of Jungle Raj and started campaigning for the revelations
 susheel modi ne koi badi raily nahin kii or koi band auki virodh-pradarshan nahin kiya
 Through documents, frequent revelations were made and surrounded Lalu, his son Tejashwi and the entire family on corruption charges
 aise vakt main jab congress samet tamaam dalon kii ranneeti modi or bijepi ko gherne main vifal sabit ho rahi he susheel modi kii ye ranneeti vipakshi dalon ke liye ek sabak he

 congress-jedies gathbandhan ko ab bhi dar he ki kahin bijepi oparation lotus ko safal karaane ke liye unke vidhayak na tod den
 Therefore, Congress has taken a big step on the lines of BJP as a precautionary measure
 karnataka main congress-jedies kii saajha sarkaar bhale hi batch gai ho lekin congress ne apane sabhi vidhayakon ko filhal bahari bangalooru ke ek resort main rakhane kaa faisalaa kiya he, jab tak bijepi ke sabhi vidhayak gurugram se waapas karnatek na laut aaen
 Let us know that on Saturday morning, Karnataka BJP President BS Yeddyurappa has called back all the BJP mlas encamped in Gurugram
 darasal, ab congress ne apane vidhayakon ko bhaajapa ke hamale se bachaane ke liye resort le jane kii ranneeti apanaai he
 Siddaramaiah, the leader of the Congress Legislature Party in Karnataka, said on Friday that his party was taking a resort to "protect" its mlas from the "attack" of the BJP
 karnataka ke purv mukhyamantri siddharamaiya ne aarope lagaaya ki pradhanmantri narendra modi or bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah gathbandhan sarkaar ko asthir karne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai kyonki unhen aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon main teen yaa chaar siten hi milane kaa dar he
 Siddaramaiah said, "all our mlas will be together
 ham vahaan sookhe kii sthiti par charchaa karenge
 All our mlas, mps and Ministers will remain in one place
 
 
 jab tak jaruri hoga, ham rahenge
 "he told reporters here," we will discuss the issues of the party
 
 
 bhaajapa ke hamale se bachane ke liye
 We will also discuss drought, Lok Sabha elections
 "congress ke sheersh sutron ke anusaar, party ke kam se kam aath vidhayakon ne paala badalane kaa vaada kiya tha
 Sources said that to avoid this, the legislators were taken to a resort located on the outskirts of the city
 congress vidhayak dal kii baithak ke baad sabhi 75 vidhayakon ko bas main bhar kar bahari bengalooru ke ek resort le jaaya gaya
 All these mlas will remain there till the return of BJP mlas from Gurugram
 lekin jab vidhayak dal ke netaa siddhaharmaiyya se poocha gaya ki ab wo aisa kyo kar rahe hai to unhone bijepi netaa yediurppa kii bhashaa main jawaab diya

 Schools will have to seek government approval by increasing the fees, after which private schools filed a review petition in the High Court double bench

 In its order, the court has said that the government is allowed to take action on private schools which do not obey the directorate of education
 yanifees badhanese pehlesarkaar kii manzooreelena privet skulon ke liye anivaary hoga
 Apart from this, the High Court has told the schools that if they increase the fees in the mid-session and the Directorate of Education takes action on them, then they are free to challenge the action of the Directorate of Education in this matter in the court

 By the way, it is also said that the path of the boys' heart goes through the stomach

 Boys like girls who listen to them and listen carefully to all their big and small things
 agar aap bhi kisi kaa dil churaana chaahati hai to acchhee shrota ban jaaiye

 Praising Sachin Tendulkar, playing his last Test, for his tireless hard work and commitment, Narendra Modi said that every Indian is proud of this cricketer
 bhaajapa ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar modi ne kaha, aaj har bhartiya kii nazren mumbai par he, jahaan sachin cricket ko alavida kehane ja rahe hai
 The country is proud of him
 unhone kaha, har bhartiya ko sachin kaa naam lekar garv hota he
 With his hard work, commitment, dedication and tireless efforts, Sachin has set new records in the game

 sharad pavaar ne kaha- shivasena se koi baat nahin huiraut ne kiya tha 170 vidhayakon ke samarthan kaa daawapavar bole- agar koi baat hogi to sirf uddhav se hogimaharashtra main 9 november ko vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal khatm ho rahaa he, lekin 24 oktober ko vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey aane ke baad se ab tak ye tay nahin ho paaya he ki maharashtra main koun sarkaar banayega or koun vipaksh main baithegaa
 After the elections, power politics is now going on to form the government and Shiv Sena and its leader Sanjay Raut are at the center of the discussion
 lekin sonia gandhi se mulaakaat ke baad sharad pavaar ne aisa bayaan diya he, jo raut ke liye jhatka mana ja saktaa he
 In fact, on Sunday, Sanjay Raut claimed that the Shiv Sena has the support of 170 mlas and that the number may even reach 175
 is daawey ke saath hi raut ne maharashtra kaa aglaa mukhyamantri shivasena se hone kii baat kahi thi
 On this statement of Raut, NCP leader Nawab Malik also said yes it is possible
 lekin somvaar ko jab ensipi ke chif sharad pavaar dilli main sahyogi congress kii antarim adhyaksh sonia gandhi se milakar nikle to unka bayaan shivasena ke liye mufeed nahin tha
 Sharad Pawar told that no one has spoken to me on behalf of Shiv Sena
 shivasena netaa sanjay raut se mulaakaat par sharad pavaar ne kaha ki wo rajyasabha main mere saathi sadsy hai
 But if there is any political discussion, it will be only with Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, not anyone else
 ye he siton kaa samikaranpavaar ke bayaan se saaf he ki sanjay raut bhale hi kuch bhi bayaan dete rahen, lekin milakar sarkaar gathan karne kaa agar koi nirnay hota he to uske liye sirf uddhav thakare se baatcheet hogi
 In such a situation, the question is, which 170 mlas were Sanjay Raut talking about supporting
 kyonki maharashtra kii kul 288 vidhansabha siton main se 105 bijepi, 56 shivasena, 54 ensipi, 44 congress, 2 AIMIM, 3 bahujan vikaas aghadi, 13 nirdaleeyon or 11 anya ke paas hai
 That is, without the support of Congress and NCP, no such condition is being formed on the basis of which Shiv Sena can claim an absolute majority
 ab sawaal yaheen aakar atak gaya he ki maharashtra main sarkaar koun banayega, kyonki bijepi or shivasena apni-apni jagah ade hue hai, jabaki soobe main vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal 9 november ko khatm ho rahaa he
 Recently, Narendra Modi, the bjp's PM candidate, filed his nomination from Vadodara, for the first time, the name of his wife Jashodaben was revealed
 vadodara main namakan ke baad se modi par lagaataar unki vaivaahik sthiti ko lekar hamale ho rahe hai
 On Saturday, the Congress once again attacked Modi with his wife
 congress ne kaha bijepi ke piem ummidavaar apni patni ko to sammaan dete nahin hai to ve anya mahilaon ke sammaan ke bare main kaise baat kar sakate hai
 Congress spokesperson Shobha Ojha said, Modi's decision to hide the truth about his marital status is not a personal but a legal issue
 shobhaa ne daawa kiya ki modi ko beete varshon main apni vaivaahik sthiti ke bare main bataanaa jaruri nahin laga
 He was allegedly involved in the espionage case and has told people that he is unmarried

 Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani has sought to end US drone strikes in the troubled tribal region, saying that his country is trying to acquire intelligence aircraft technology from the US
 gilaani ne kaha ki pakistan khufia jaankaree kaa aadan-pradaan badhanaa chahta he taaki vah aatankwaadiyon se khud ke bal par nipat sake
 Gilani raised the issue of drone strikes before a delegation led by John Bohner, the president of the US House of Representatives, and said that US lawmakers should persuade the Obama administration to formulate a joint strategy, under which drone technology can be handed over to Pakistan 
 bohanor ke saath hui baithak ke baad neshnal assembly yaa sansad ke nichle sadan ko sambodhit karte hue gilaani ne kaha ki unhone america pratinidhimandal ko siie dwaara sanchalit khufia vimaanon ke missile hamalon ke kaaran janata main badhate rosh ke bare main bataaya
 He said, 'I told him that if you want to succeed in the war against terrorism, then you have to respect our political and military efforts

 He said that the war against terrorism is Pakistan's own fight, which it will fight to eliminate the enemy who is posing a serious threat to the country
 gilaani ne kaha ki america ko pakistan ke khufia tantra ko vishwasaneey jaankaree deni chaiye or phir desh apni sarajameen par maujuud aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf khud hi karrwai karegaa
 However, Pakistan openly opposes US drone strikes in the tribal areas, but analysts say there is an inherent understanding between the two countries regarding the attacks and this has led to the elimination of dozens of Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders including tehreek-e-taliban Pakistan chief Baitullah Mehsud

 Madhusudan wrote a letter to the Election Commission for not recognizing him as the AIADMK general secretary
 is bich shashikala ne kaha ki hamaara vishwaas he ki rajyapal samvidhan or loktantr ko akshunn rakhenge
 In a strong message to his opponents, Sasikala on Friday sacked the party's presidium president e Madhusudhanan from the party's primary membership
 vah guuruuvaar ko hi mukhyamantri o panniraselvam ke kheme main shaamil hue the
 Sasikala appointed former minister KA Sengottayan as the new President of AIADMK
 udhar, madhusudan ne kaha, ‘unke mujhe annadramuk se baahar nikaalane se pehle hi maine unhen nishkasit kar diya tha
 ' sengottayan ko party ke sanghathan sachiv ke pad se mukt kar diya gaya
 He was appointed Organization Secretary last week
 shashikala ne party kaaryakartaaon se aagrah kiya he ki ve madhusudanan ke saath koi sambandh naa rakhen or kaha ki unhen sengottayan ko apana sahyog dena chaiye
 Providing a strong support to the opposing camp, Madhusudhanan lent his support to Panneerselvam and said, 'he wants to protect the party
 ’ He had said, 'to protect the AIADMK, everyone should join hands with Panneerselvam
 ’ shashikala ne baghawat karne ke tatkaal baad panniraselvam ko party ke koshadhyaksh ke pad se hataa diya tha lekin panniraselvam kaa kahana he ki party kii asthaayee mahasachiv hone ke naate unke paas party padaadhikariyon ko niyukt karne yaa hataane kii shaktiyaan nahin hai
 Even now claiming to be treasurer, he has written a letter to banks to not allow anyone else to operate the party's accounts without their approval
 shashikala ne varisht netaa dindigul si shrinivasana ko koshadhyaksh niyukt kiya tha
 Reversing Sasikala, Madhusudhanan wrote a letter to the Election Commission requesting that they not recognize VK Sasikala as party general secretary
 unhone kaha ki unka chunaav party ke kanoon ke mutabik nahin hua he
 Madhusudhanan revealed this to reporters
 isse thodi der baad hi shashikala ne unhen ‘‘party ke khilaaf kaam karne’’ ke liye annadramuk se barkhaast kar diya
 Madhusudhanan stressed that according to party rules, only party workers have the right to choose the general secretary
 unhone chunaav ayog se party pramukh ke taur par shashikala ko manyata nahin dene kaa anurodh kiya
 The expelled Rajya Sabha member of AIADMK, Sasikala Pushpa, has already filed a petition in the Commission against the election of VK Sasikala
 unka aarope tha ki chunaav niyamon ke mutabik nahin hua or chunaav ayog ne is par party kii pratikriya bhi maangi thi
 a candidate for the post of general secretary must spend at least five years in the party
 madhusudanan ne kaha, ‘chunki shashikala 31 march, 2012 main hi annadramuk main phir shaamil huin, atev vah mahasachiv banane kii paatrata nahin rakhti hai
 i have requested the Election Commission not to approve his appointment
 ’ Meanwhile, a section of AIADMK mlas denied the media's news and the Panneerselvam faction's allegation that they were held hostage at a special place here

 Panneerselvam's pro-mla VC Arookutty told reporters, "it is difficult to reach the mlas
 unhen bandhak banaakar rakhaa gaya he
 They are elected representatives by the people, so they should be released
 unhen jane diya jaae evam logon se milane diya jaae

 Dimple Yadav, who was elected unopposed in the Kannauj Lok Sabha seat vacated by her husband Akhilesh Yadav's resignation, has become the second woman MP to represent this Lok Sabha constituency
 isse pehle 1984 main dilli kii maujuuda mukhyamantri shila dikshit yahaan se chunaav jiti thim
 After receiving the victory certificate, Dimple went to the Tila temple with Akhilesh Yadav and offered prayers and accepted the greetings of the people standing on the way
 dimple ne pati akhilesh ke hi istife se khaali hui firozabad loksabhaa seat ke liye 2009 main bhi upachunaav ladi thi lekin tab vah congress ke ummidavaar rajbabbar se haar gayi thim
 In this election, the Congress and the BSP did not field candidates against Dimple, while the BJP candidates, who decided to contest at the last minute, missed nominations on time
 chunaav maidan main utre sanyukt samaajawaadee dal ke pratyaashee dasharath shankhwar tathaa nirdaleey ummidavaar sanju katiyaar dwaara apana naam waapas le liye jane ke baad nau june ko dimple ko nirvirodh nirvaachit ghoshit kar diya gaya
 The citizenship amendment bill has been passed in the Lok Sabha
 loksabhaa main is bill ke paksh main 334 mat pade hai or virodh main maatr 106
 You can say that this bill passed with a broad consensus in the House
 lekin is bill ko lekar purvottar ke rajyon main waisi vyapak aam sahmati nahin dikhti he
 In fact, the mps in the northeastern states got much later and much less time due to the low numbers
 jin rajyon main is bill ko lekar sabase adhik ashankaayen thim unke hi saansad do teen para ke sankshipt bhaashan dekar chale gaye
 Wish they had more time, the rest of India would have had more opportunity to understand the restlessness of the Northeast
 jaise aap yah jaan pate ki mizoram ke ek maatr saansad mizo neshnal front ke si lalaroxanga ne bill kaa samarthan kiya lekin jo aagrah kiya use andekha nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Lalrozanga said that Mizoram was undergoing mental torture regarding this bill
 lekin pradhanmantri or grahamantri ne hamaari chintaaon ko dhyaan main rakhaa
 Mizoram is excluded from this bill
 yah bill dharmik pratadna ke aadhaar par naagarikta kii baat karata he
 We urge the Central and all the State Governments of the country to ensure that at least we do not have religious persecution
 north east ko lekar jo bhi aashvsaan die gaye hai unhen puraa kiya jaae
 There is only one MP from Sikkim
 sikkam karmchaaree morcha se saansad ke indra hang subba ne bill kaa virodh kiya or kaha 1975 main sikkim kaa bharat main vilay hua tha
 The citizenship of the people of Sikkim is determined according to the Sikkim Subjects Regulations 1961
 vilay se pehle paidaa hue sikkim ke log sikkimi bhartiya maane jate hai
 They should have been kept out of the purview of the citizenship amendment bill
 ham iskaa virodh karte hai
 Amit Shah has said in response that the protection that Sikkim enjoys under Article 371 will not be tampered with
 purvottar ke aath aise rajya hai jahaan yah bill puri tarah lagu nahin hoga yaa lagu hoga to kuch hisson main hoga
 That is, can they talk about their legitimate concerns of protest against the national interest? Due to this bill, for the first time the system of inner line permit will be brought in Manipur so that the citizenship law cannot be implemented there
 is bill ko laane ke liye inner line permit kaa vaada kyon karnaa padaa, ek desh ek kanoon kii samaj rakhane vaale logon ke liye yah jaananaa zaruri he
 No Indian citizen without a permit can neither go and stay in states with Inner Line Permits
 arunachal pradesh, mizoram or nagaland main yah vyavastha thi or ab modi sarkaar ne manipur main bhi inner line permit lagu karne kaa vaada kiya he, tabhi manipur ko naagarikta kanoon ke daayre se baahar rakhaa jayega
 It needs the Northeast
 bharat ke anya sarahadi ilaakon main bhi inner line permit system he
 Kashmir is in the adjoining areas of Ladakh, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh
 yah kanoon 1873 ke angrezi kanoon kii viraasat he
 It will be implemented in Manipur for the first time in 2019
 nae naagarikta kanoon ke tahat jin logon ko bharat kii naagarikta milegi wo manipur, mizoram, nagaland or arunachal pradesh main jaakar nahin bas sakate hai
 They have to carry a permit
 purvottar ke rajyon main naagarikta register yani enarasi ko lekar kya stand he
 The Nagaland government issued a notification for the citizenship register in July
 mizoram kii sarkaar ne mizoram mentanence of houseold register bill banaaya he jo neshnal register kii tarah he
 The Chief Minister of Mizoram has also met Prime Minister Modi regarding this and sought permission
 ise vidhansabha main paas kiya ja chukaa he
 Mizoram says that people from Myanmar and Bangladesh should be identified
 tripura main congress ke pradesh adhyaksh ne enarasi kii maang kii he
 Home Minister Amit Shah has been speaking in silence in the Lok Sabha that he is coming with NRC
 isi sadan main lekar aa rahe hai
 Will Amit Shah conduct NRC again in Assam? The NRC which fails in Assam, otherwise there is no need to bring citizenship bill
 assam main khud bijepi ke netaa enarasi ko lekar sawaal uthaa chuke hai
 What did Assam get from NRC
 teen saal tak saadhe teen karod log dastauez lekar yahaan se vahaan bhaagate rahe
 No one has yet done an authentic study of how much people have bribed to get their own voter test
 tab pataa chalegaa ki is ek niti ne baabuon kii jeb main karod bhar die
 The people there are telling that a lot of money has been spent
 sarkaar ke bhi 1600 karod pani main gaye
 Let's take a look at Tripura before Assam
 9 disambar ko jab bill loksabhaa main pesh ho rahaa tha, tripura main jabardast virodh ho rahaa tha
 The Indigenous People's Front of Tripura, an ally in Tripura's BJP government, has opposed it
 hadtaal kaa aahvaan kiya tha
 The IPFT and BJP contested the election together
 iske 8 vidhayak hai or 35 bijepi ke
 IPFT is in government but says it will protest while in government
 somvaar ko hi anya sanghathanon ne bhi hadtaal kaa aahvaan kiya tha
 More than a thousand people had to be detained
 tripura kii ekmaatr state uniwarsity maharaja bir vikram uniwarsity or tripura central uniwarsity kii pariksha sthagit kar di gai he
 Trains were also stopped there
 baar-baar kehane par bhi ki tripura tribal ariaz aatonomas district council ke 20 rigerv seat ko naagarikta bill se baahar rakhaa gaya he
 Protests in tribal areas are fierce
 dhalai zile main gair janajaatiy dukaanon ko jala diya gaya he
 Mobile data and Internet in Tripura have been shut down for 48 hours
 esemes band rahegaa
 People there will miss Kashmir for 48 hours
 joint movement against siabi main kai dal shaamil hai
 They have also called for an indefinite strike
 mukhyamantri biplab deb ne kaha he ki andolan kaa koi asar nahin he or iskaa koi tuk nahin he kyonki janajaatiy samudaay ko pehle se sangrakshan hasil he
 Demonstrations are not taking place in non-tribal areas
 vahaan sthiti saamaanya he
 There are different views in the Northeast
 kya unka hit raashtra hit nahin he? kya aapke hindi akhabaaron or channelon ne bataaya ki is bill ko lekar purvottar main kitni alag alag pratikriya he? sochie in akhabaaron ko padhakar aapaki samaj rashtriya banati he yaa jhetreey
 Sometimes you have to think that your understanding of your citizenship has been compressed, limited or expanded by Hindi newspapers
 tripura main virodh jis kaaran se ho rahaa he assam main bhi usee kaaran se ho rahaa he
 The Assam movement was against the infiltrators
 yah bill ghuspaithiye ko hindu or muslim ke aadhaar main bantwaaraa karata he
 Why are the demonstrations happening overnight at the University of Assam
 assam main bhi imtahaan chal rahe hai
 The North East Student Organization NESO called for an 11-hour shutdown on Tuesday
 purvottar ke rajyon ke chaatro kaa yah bada sanghathan he
 Only Nagaland was excluded from this bandh because the Hornbill Festival is going on there
 north east stodand argenizeshan NESO ke band kaa congress, left or AIDUF ne samarthan kiya he
 When this bill was being passed in the Lok Sabha at midnight, students were demonstrating on the street in many universities of Assam
 assam ke logon ne loksabhaa ke chunaav main bijepi ko jamkar vot kiya he
 The students say that the CAB is a direct attack on their identity
 guwahati uniwarsity ke chaatro ne ek press relij taiyaar kiya he jisamen likhaa he ki yah bill samvidhan kii prastaavna ko badalane ja rahi he
 If India is a secular country, then how can such a law come there which gives citizenship to people of particular community and does not give to anyone
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki jab 2016 main bill kaa draft aayaa tha to usamen dharmik pratadna kaa shabd nahin tha sirf minurity likhaa tha
 There is no religious torture even in the 2019 draft
 hamane is bill kaa praaroop dekha
 Religious torture written in its purpose
 yah bill bharat ko aadhikarik rup se anti islamic banaata he
 At the same time Assam also violates the agreement
 usamen yahi kaha gaya tha ki 25 march 1971 ke baad jo videshi aae hai unhen pahachaanakar nikaala jayega
 It was not a matter of religion, it was a matter of removing whoever is foreign
 lekin ab to 31 disambar 2014 tak aae chah dharmon ke visthapiton ko naagarikta dene kii baat kii ja rahi he
 This is a violation of the Assam Accord
 in chaatro kii ek or chintaa he asamiya bhashaa ko lekar
 They say that one has to fill in the citizenship form to state the language
 agar sabane bangla likhaa to isse asamiya bhashaa ko haashiye par dhakel degaa
 They are not satisfied with the government's assurance on the question of language
 amit shah ne kaha he ki purvottar ke jitne bhi swytt parishad hai vahaan yah bill lagu nahin hoga
 Not applicable in Meghalaya
 assam ke bodoland, karabi anglang or dima main lagu nahin hoga
 This means that this bill will be applicable only in 27 districts out of 33 districts of Assam
 netaa aapse nahin kah paaenge
 They have many weapons to distribute
 baant kar bhi aapako kahenge ki hamane ek kiya he
 You do not have to tell this
 jab assam main naagarikta register kaa kaam shuru hua to assam ko laga ki gale kaa haar he
 That necklace is now a necklace in Assam
 is naagarikta register se assam ko kya mila? ab jab puure desh main enarasi lagu hoga to sochie aam logon par kya guzaregi? assam se baahar ke musalmaan pareshaan ho gaye hai
 Being born in this soil, searching papers to prove it
 jo hamaare saath khele or bade hue wo puch rahe hai ki koun sa kagaz laana hoga
 Isn't it enough that everyone should be ashamed that your colleague, our colleague, our classmate, your classmate, your neighbor, our neighbor will stand in line and prove citizenship? Was this India's dream? In 1947, this India rejected partition on the basis of religion
 ab us bharat main dharm ke aadhaar par nagirakata di ja rahi he or us bharat ke logon se naagarikta kaa pramaan patr dena hoga
 What will happen to the poor, who do not even have their own address
 un par kya beetegi jo is bharat ko apana samaj kar kai rajya badal kar jane kahaan kahaan bas chuke hai
 Is this the dream of making India a world guru? Until the list comes, one has to go through the mental torture of being a foreigner even for a moment
 aap un misaalon kaa saamana kaise karenge jab hindu or musalmaan donon ne hazaron kii sankhya main is bharat ke sapane ke liye jaan di thi
 This is the India that chose 81-year-old Bahadur Shah Zafar as its leader in the freedom struggle of 1857
 tab unhen kisi ne videshi nahin kaha
 Will you be able to meet eyes with Bhagat Singh? Will you be able to match eyes with Ashfaq and Bismil? Will you be able to see Gandhi? Was there such a difference between Subhash Chand Bose's Azad Hind Fauz? Did they search for citizenship before forming Azad Hind Fauj? Did you see the religion of your soldiers? Today Assam will have to think why the rest of India is not dealing with their restlessness? Did the speech of any leader, apart from government assurances, contain the voice of Assam's concerns? Today it is spread in the roads and universities of Assam
 assam ko bangla bhashi logon ke bare main sochna hoga
 India will also have to think at what point the fabricated politics of infiltration has left them
 nagirakata milegi phir bhi ve andeh kii nazar se dekhe jaaenge
 Otherwise, was it not his happy day today? Today, Bangla speakers must have been scared on the basis of language

 kya koi ipies adhikari whatsap par aise video ko forward kar saktaa he jisamen chunaav main kisi raajnneetik dal kii jeet kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa ho? chhattisgarh cader ke charchit ipies adhikari es aar pi kalluri ne aisa hi karnama kar dikhaaya he
 Kalluri may have been transferred from Bastar to the police headquarters, but his chase has not been abandoned due to controversies
 taaja maamla whatsap par unke ek video ko forward karne ko lekar he
 It claims bjp's victory in the country where elections are being held, especially in Uttar Pradesh
 congress ne civil seva aacharan samhita kaa hawala dekar kalluri ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang kii he
 The government is awaiting a written complaint
 video main anemation ke jariye pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bahubali film ke drishy kii tarj main shivlinga uthaate dikhaaya gaya he
 While Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi are watching with frustration standing nearby
 is video ke saamne aane ke baad congress ne kalluri ke khilaaf morcha khol diya he
 According to Chhattisgarh Congress President Bhupesh Baghel, this is an open violation of the Service Code of Conduct
 baghel ne kaha ki koi bhi sarkari adhikari samvidhan ke tahat kisi raajnneetik gatividhi main shaamil nahin ho saktaa
 But the kind of video that Kalluri has put out has an appeal to BJP
 baghel ke mutabik ye gambhir maamla he or kalluri ke khilaaf anushaasanamak karrwai honi chahie
 The state government is also surprised by this move of Kalluri
 haal main sarkaar ne dishanirdesh jari kar sabhi adhikariyon or karmchaariyon ko aagaah kiya tha ki vososhal mediaya anyatra aisa koi aacharan naa kare jisase sarkaar kii chhavi kharaab ho yaa phir vibhaag kii gatividhiyon par sawalia nishaan lage

 Sonu Nigam has spoken openly about the national anthem, demonetisation, azaan
 unhone aaj tak ke korykram mumbai manthan 2017 main shirkat kiya tha
 Read, what he said about the Ajan controversy, Modi government, Bollywood industry and religion
 1
 On the issue of national anthem in the cinema hall, Sonu Nigam said- It is a matter of honor for us
 ise aap restaurant, movie haul main bajaakar chota naa kariye
 i will take my parents where they will be respected
 mere hisaab se theatre main rashtriya gaan nahin bajnaa chahie or agar baj rahaa he to sabko khadaa hona chahie
 i will also stand for the national anthem of others
 main leftist nahin hum naa rhite wing main hum
 I'm in the middle
 2
 On the arrangements made by the government on the severe rains this time in Mumbai, Sonu said - i am saying as a citizen
 kisi se gilaa shikawa nahin he
 It has been 3 years of Mumbai Government
 inkaa prayaas dikh rahaa he
 In future i would like that the traffic and road conditions should be fine
 3
 On demonetisation, he said- My father was against demonetisation, but i think it was fine
 kam se kam koi soch to rahaa he kuch thik karne kaa
 4
 modi sarkaar par unhone kaha ki sarkaraa acha kaam kar rahi he
 Effort is visible
 kuch log or media gardan par talwaar lekar baithe rahete hai
 Even though this is true, only then will the government do well
 5
 About his career he said- i did not get anything in the industry soon
 'acha sila diya' acha hit tha
 Then i could not find work
 phir 'sandeshe aate hai' mila
 Yeh Dil Divana became my identity
 meraa kariyar ek gane se nahin bana
 i would not have been able to get success quickly
 achaanak sab miltaa to main pagal ho jaataa
 6
 sonu ne kaha ki pehle lav letters bahut aate the
 Discontinued after the arrival of the Internet
 pehle khun ke likhe letters bhi aate the
 It is no longer the era
 ab fasebuk ke jariye log sampark karte hai

 aajkal arijit singh, armaan malik acha ga rahe hai

 maine rafee sahab ko adarsh mana, lekin unki tarah banane kii koshish nahin kii
 Everyone has a different identity
 main khud kya cheez hum, ye sochna chahie
 8
 ajaan maamle main sonu ke twit ke baad jo vivaad hua tha, us par unhone kaha- har insaan kaa ferj banataa he ki agar use kuch galat dikhataa he, to wo uske khilaaf aawaaj uthaae
 9
 ajaan maamle main dharm bhi jud gaya tha
 In India, people do not understand the heart of the matter, they see it upside down
 usee twit main maine mandir, gurudware ke bare main likhaa he, lekin ajaan ko hilite kiya gaya
 Bollywood was also split after my tweet
 main hairaan hum
 i am not religious, but i am a believer
 mujhe sabamein ishwar dikhataa he
 i believe in all religions
 My close friends came against me at that time
 haalanki sab iske virodh main nahin the
 Today many people appreciate my move
 main aise desh main rahata hum, jahaan baat- baat par fatwa jari hota he
 10
 vivaad ke baad unhone twitor ko chhod diya tha
 To this he said- i saw and learned a lot in Mumbai
 maine siikhaa he ki kabhi galat sangat main nahin rahanaa chahie
 i don't hang out with the wrong people
 gaali dene waalon ke saath nahin rahata
 Twitter is a platform where anyone can abuse anyone
 isliye ab main vahaan nahin rahanaa chahta
 Unless the entire flow of Indian politics, especially the post-independence period, is seen with a bird's eye view, the full significance of the qualitative, legislative changes that have taken place in the near 30 years are not clear
 main kisi party or netaa vishesh ke bare main kuch nahin kahuunga, sirf ghatnaon ke madhyam se chizon ke bare main bataanaa chaahunga
 It is a few days after independence
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha main ek dal sattadhari dal se tuutakar alag hua
 There was no party-change law at that time
 to bhi us dal ke netaa (jo us samay ke bade pratishthit the) ne yah tay kiya ki jis dal ke chunaav chinh par ladakar ve aae the or ab us dal se alag ho rahe hai to vidhansabha se bhi istipha denge
 It is a hallmark of the attitude of the time about the kind of belief and conduct in party change
 us samay aisa bhi nahin tha ki log dal se hatate the to sattadhari dal ko ghabrahat hoti thi
 If he wanted, he would also sit in the assembly and protest
 ab dekhie isamen kitna badlaav aayaa he
 In the meantime, the party became an act to prevent change, which is a qualitative change
 unheen dinon kii baat he ki ek pradesh main ek dal kii sarkaar bani, usne janata par goli chalaa di
 The senior leader of that party said that you resign, why did you shoot? He forced it
 aaj to roj goliyaan chalati hai, ab ye jo badlaav he ki us samay goli chalaanaa ek prakaar se apwaad mana jaataa tha, us apwaad ko bhi sweekaar nahin karenge, ye niti-siddhant tha
 Today we are firing every day, and any party is in government, such incidents happen daily
 in chizon par gambhirtha se vichaar hona chahie
 Another interesting example is of those days
 ek pradesh main jameendaari unmoolan ke bare main ek vidheyak prastut kiya gaya
 There was only a small party and its principle was to oppose zamindari
 lekin uske adhikansh sadasyon main se kareeb 80 fisadi ne jameendaari unmoolan vidheyak kaa virodh kar diya
 The top leader of that party immediately decided to expel them from the party
 unka maananaa tha ki ham jameendaari pratha ke samarthak nahin hai, bhale ye log khud jameendaar rahe hon lekin agar party main hai or aisi saidhantik vikruti paidaa kar rahe hai, to yah nahin chalegaa
 But today despite the anti-defection law, see what people do
 kitni baar sansad main rupye lekar matdaan karne kaa maamla saamne aa chukaa he
 In the old times, there was no law but party moral discipline, there were serious ideas about principles and policies
 aaj kya ho rahaa he sabko maaloom he
 We have to consider that politics is made up of two words - Raj and Policy
 isamen donon kaa hona aavashyak he kyonki bina niti ke agar aap raaj kar rahe hai to vah arajak he
 If there is policy and there is no rule, then that policy is paralyzed
 isliye usamen hameshaa samanvay rakhane kii jarurat hoti he
 If we look at the developments after independence, you will find that today there is more emphasis on the rule and not on the policy
 pehle or ab main jo ek spasht rekha he- hamen raaj karne kaa prabhaav chahie, hamen raaj chahie
 This trend has increased in the last 30 years, whether it is a criminal, violent, rapist, adulteress, corrupt, black marketer, whatever
 
 
 agar ve raaj banane main sahaayak he to uskaa swaagat he
 The second thing is that there will be more or less
 lekin sabhi jagah yah pravriti aa gai he
 Earlier in politics, there was intense opposition to these things, now in place of it, i will not say a single acceptance but it has already come to tolerate and tolerate it
 kuch jagah to shaayad sweekaaryata bhi ho gai he
 People are not uncomfortable about this in the current environment
 chaahe jaise bhi ho, raaj karnaa he kii soch raajnneeti main puri tarah se haaavee he
 Make and break teams, you see the latest situations
 punjab main kya ho rahaa he, bihar main kya hua, upi main chunaav se pehle jo ho rahaa he, vah kya he? aaj chunaav jeetna hi mahaj sabakuch rah gaya he
 Looking at the conduct of parties in parliamentary or assembly and circumstances in the society, one thing will always be said - literature is always a mirror of society
 lekin raajnneeti samaaj kii dasha or darshan he
 So when you see these two together, then the current behavior of politics is understandable, because today the emphasis on Raj is more and the emphasis on policy and principles is less
 lekin ab yah hua kyon he, hamen yah bhi samajhnaa hoga
 If there is such a qualitative difference in behavior, i see that it is visible in some form in the whole society
 jo janpratinidhi hai ve bhi samaaj se hi paidaa hue hai or phir ve samaaj ko banane-bigaadpee ke liye hi kaam karte hai
 When we came from the society and then formed a society, both of us have a mutual relationship
 ab isamen dosha kiskaa he? murgi pehle hui ki anda, koun pehle-koun baad main is par darshanik bahes ho sakati he
 We are talking about reality
 ham log jab chaatr the to vidyalayon-vishvavidhyalayon main nishtha vaala maahaul tha
 When we have come to school and university, we have to study, our thinking about teachers was completely traditional
 koi yah soch bhi nahin saktaa tha ki adhyaapan ke kshetra main koi aniatikta hogi
 When the teacher used to teach, if a student did not come to class, then he used to go to his house and ask what happened, got sick? i have seen that many times the financial condition of the family is not good, the fees could not be filled, then the teachers used to try to collect the fee of that child or waive the fees
 chaatr ke gun dekhakar usko aage badhaane or pratibha ko jaanchane kii pravriti thi
 We have not seen that there was any caste-fraternal relationship between the student and the teacher
 lekin aaj kya he
 Now students become public representatives from the same
 kachhari-court main jaj sahab ne kuch kah diya he to log maan lete hai
 Justice was available at that time, but now the judgments have started to be found
 sthiti yah ho gai he ki ab nirnay bhi liye jate hai
 Whether we will get justice or not, we do not know
 lekin ek nirnay milegaa
 Whether or not that decision is justified, but i can take it if i can
 chikitsa ke kshetra main chikitsakon kii, vaidya ho, hakim ho, yaa doctor, unka vyavhaar or samaaj ke prati drushtikon aaj ke samay se bilkul bhinn tha
 Illness cannot be a reason to recover money
 kisi kii majaburi se ham dhani ho jaaen yah soch nahin thi
 i know many such doctors who used to give medicines free of cost to the poor and also gave milk money for nutrition because they knew that it is their moral religion that if someone comes ill at their door, they should be cured
 lekin ab aisa nahin he
 Was a very large surgeon, he told me that Dr
 joshi jab ham padhate the to hamako bataaya jaataa tha ki kisi marij kii cheer-faad karne se pehle yah dekh lo ki uski ''pulse" strang he yaa nahin
 But now we see whether his purse is strong or not
 ab yah kahaan se aa gaya
 These are the circumstances, the same people come into politics, and without politics, perhaps they go back there again
 is aadan-pradaan par hamen gambhirtha se vichaar karnaa hoga ki yah itnaa vyapak kaise ho gaya
 Are politics and leaders alone responsible for this? Or are there some elements that have brought about this kind of change in the whole society? What are those elements? And how were those elements that we emphasized on earning in place of the force that was on our old policy, morality and duty (I will not use the word religion)
 haalanki is disha main aap dekhenge ki raajnneeti main ab bhrashtachar or kaledhan ko khatm karne, use tantra se dur karne ke liye deshbhar main ek vyapak jagriti dikhaai de rahi he
 This is a good qualitative change
 chunaav or anya gatividhiyaan shuddh dhan se chale uski bhi koshish hi rahi he
 Which has received widespread public support and is welcome
 lekin kabhi-kabhi main sochataa hum ki pichley 25-30 saal main ek vaishvik arthvyavastha kaa nirmaan hua he jisane dhan ko bahut adhik mahatv diya he
 Due to this, there has also been a tendency to fundraise more and more
 abhi hamane dekha ki ek sarkari afasar jisaki pramanikta nihsandeh thi, lekin jab usko pakadaa gaya or sibiai ne mukadmaa chalaaya to usne adaalat se kaha ki mere paas paisa nahin he, main vakil nahin kar saktaa, aap mujhe jail main daal dijie
 Now what has happened ek taraf pravriti he ki vah kahata he ki maine koi aniatik kaam nahin kiya, mere paas paisa nahin he, main itani badi fees nahin de saktaa
 So what is happening in advocacy
 vahaan vyaktiyon ko nyaay mili kya ham iske liye prayatnsheel hai? agar uske paas dhan ho to vah aniatik karke bhi chhutkaaraa paa saktaa he or dhanheen vyakti yahaan ghor naitikta ke jivan ke baad bhi uske upar aarope lag gaye
 i am emphasizing these things because it is right that as a leader we are accused that you are the guide of the country
 lekin sawaal he ki ham kiske maardarshak hai? ham to usee maarg kaa darshan kar rahe hai jis par sab chalakar aa rahe hai
 For the qualitative changes that are taking place, i think that the philosophical changes that have taken place, the vision of the society has changed and all are born from it
 uski jad main jo bhogavaad he use nav udaarvaad kehete hai or yah bhogavaad kaa hi doosraa naam he
 These are essential aspects of the culture of consumerism
 isliye ek buniyadi chintan kii aavashyaktaa he ki hamen saamaajik vikaas, saamaajik pragati ke bare main punarmoolyankan karte hue iske bare main vichaar karnaa chahie ki is desh kii prakruti, medha, sansaadhan, itihaas, maansikta, saamaajik banaavat in sab chizon ko dekhte hue ham saamaajik, aarthik, naitik or phir prashasnic (main rajnatik nahin kah rahaa hum) is par koi samuhik drushti viksit karen or us par kuch vyavhaar kii moolbhoot maryaadaaon ke bare main vichaar karen
 In any area where there is a violation of those basic dignities, there is encroachment, if any institutional change is needed to curb it
 main kai baar sochataa hum ki kya aisa sansthagat parivartan ho saktaa he? or agar ho saktaa he to us sanstha ke niyantrak koun honge? ve aise vyakti ho sakate hai jiskaa baaki samaaj kii aarthik, saamaajik, rajnatik sansthaaon main koi nihit swaarth nahin ho
 But can any such institution be formed? Was there ever such an institution in India or can we consider making it further? So i think in the last 30-40 years, we have gone rapidly aside
 iske gun-dosha or vikruti par bhi vichaar ho saktaa he
 It is not that deformity is the only deformity in the last 30 years
 bhautik or aarthik kshetra main bahut logon ne bahut oonchaaiyaan chhui hai
 But on the other hand, a section of people from all over the world has also gone into a deep moat
 mere saamne kabhi-kabhi yah vichaar aata he ki is vaishvik vishmata main ham aisi pravriti kaa nirmaan kaise kar paaenge kyonki main kai baar logon se jab naitik-aniatik prashnon par charchaa karata hum to us dauraan mujhe ek puraane bujurg ne kaha, ''bhaiya bhul gaye raag rang, bhul gaye chakri, teen chijen yaad nahin nun, tel, lakdi
 "this is such a large section of the society, what will be the effect on it, there is no concern today
 pehle yah chintaa thi ki is varg par kya prabhaav ho rahaa he
 And its contribution may be something to improve this qualitative change or to take it in the right direction and there can be something to make a better society out of it
 meri raay main karnaa chahie

 That is, there is no holiday in the country on Kim Jong Un's birthday
 har shaasha ke janmdin par jashnise kayaas isliye lagane lage hai kyonki isse pehle jo bhi uttar korea kaa shaasha rahaa, uske janmdin par saarvajanik chuttee jarur rahati thi
 When Kim Jong Il's father Kim Jong Il was the ruler, his birthday was celebrated every year on 16 February
 is din ko de of da shining star kehete hai
 This day is not only a holiday, but there was a celebration in the whole country
 isi tarah kim jong il ke pita kim sung kaa janmdin bhi 15 april ko de of da san ke rup main manaaya jaataa tha
 There was a government holiday and celebration all over the country
 kaam ke boj kaa dabaavaye rivaaj tabhi se chal rahaa tha, jab ye donon netaa jivit the or shashan kar rahe the lekin is baar kim jong un shaayad is rivaaj par brake lagane ke mood main hai
 According to sources, there is no mention of Kim Jong Un's birthday in North Korea's new calendar
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki uttar korea ke saamne jo tamaam chunautiyaan he, use dekhte hue janmdin par chuttee nahin dene kaa faisla kiya gaya he
 The truth is that North Korea still faces many challenges
 itanichunautiyonse nipatane ke liye kim jong un ko lagaataar kaam karnaa pad rahaa he
 Such a burden of work that he liked the decision not to celebrate the birthday
 chhavi sudhaarney kii koshishsutron kaa ye bhi maananaa he ki suraksha parishad ke kade pratibandhon, america kii lagaataar dhamikyon or lagaataar missile test ke chalate uttar korea kii mali haalat kaaphi kharaab ho gai he
 In such a situation, if the dictator decides to celebrate on his birthday, his image would get worse
 taanashaah ke khof se bhale hi koi jubaan nahin kholta ho lekin sutron kaa kahana he ki uttar korea main uski chhavi teji se bigadi he
 The economy is becoming hollow due to economic restrictions
 lakhon logon par berogari kaa sankat mandara rahaa he
 In such a situation, Kim Jong Un has no other way but to work continuously to handle the situation
 isliye 8 janvari ko wo na to jashn manaa rahaa he or na hi is din sarkari chuttee kii ja rahi he
 That is, on Kim's birthday, the whole country is not celebrating but working

 Attributing other factors, including state party chief Amarinder Singh, to the Congress's defeat in the Punjab Assembly elections, senior leader of Kapurthala District Congress Sukhpal Khara said that Singh should resign from the post of the Speaker taking moral responsibility for the defeat
 capurthala jila congress ke purv adhyaksh tathaa jile ke bhulatth se purv vidhayak khara ne samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, ‘captain amarinder singh bahut achche vyakti hai

 isse kaaryakartaaon main galat sandesh jaataa he
 'this fast-moving and young leader of the party also said that' Congress Bachao Yatra 'will be taken out in the party Punjab by uniting like-minded people

 Will former Prime Minister Dr
 Manmohan Singh contest from Amritsar Lok Sabha seat of Punjab? This is a very interesting question that can be answered in the coming days
 congress party ne dow manmohan singh se amritsar se chunaav ladane kii apil kii he
 On Sunday evening, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, Congress President of Punjab Sunil Jakhar and in-charge Asha Kumari met former Prime Minister Dr
 Manmohan Singh for about half an hour and during this time he urged that Dr
 Manmohan Singh contest from Amritsar this time
 is baithak ke baad punjab congress ke adhyaksh sunil jakhad ne enditivi india ko bataaya 'hamane purv pradhanmantri dow manmohan singh se aagrah kiya he ki vah punjab kii amritsar seat se chunaav lade
 This will be a matter of pride for Punjab and Punjab Congress
 dow manmohan singh keval fakr-e-hind nahin akele fakr-e-punjab nahin balki fakr-e-jahaan hai
 Obama had said that if someone wants to take an opinion, then take advice from Dr
 Manmohan Singh
 lekin kya dow manmohan singh chunaav ladane ke liye taiyaar ho gaye hai? is sawaal ke jawaab main jakhad ne kaha 'ham unako abhi bol kar aae hai lekin faisla ab unako karnaa he'amritsar punjab kii kul 13 siton main se sabase ahm loksabhaa seat maani jaati he
 From 2004 to 2014, Navjot Singh Sidhu was a Lok Sabha MP from BJP
 duraachaar main siddhu kaa tikat kaatane ke baad bijepi ne varisht netaa arun jetali ko yahaan se chunaav ladaaya lekin varisht congress netaa captain amarinder singh ne arun jetali ko kareeb ek lakh voton se chunaav haraa diya
 In late 2016, Captain Amarinder Singh resigned as MP, accusing the satluj-yamuna Link Canal case of injustice to Punjab
 iske baad farvari 2017 main amritsar loksabhaa seat par upachunaav hua jisamen congress ke gurjeet singh aujala jite
 That is, the Congress currently holds the Amritsar Lok Sabha seat and if Dr
 Manmohan Singh agrees to fight this seat, then the sitting MP will have to consider shifting or cutting his ticket
 ye shaayad ab tak kaa pehla aisa encounter hoga jisamen police or aatankwaadi donon taraf so goliyaan chalin lekin teen pulisavaale jakhmi chaaku se hue
 Before the encounter of eight SIMI terrorists who fled from Bhopal Central Jail and after the encounter, some such pictures have come to the fore
 encounter se sirf 15 minute pehle kii tasveeron main eentkhedi kii pahari par khadey pehle paanch or phir chah vahi aatankwaadi najar aae jo bhopal central jail se bhaage the
 The police team reached the spot and surrounded them all
 pahari par dur khadey saare aatankwaadi behad itmeenaan se khaali haath khadey the
 They had no weapons
 police ko dekhakar bhi wo bhaag nahin balki vahiin rahe
 The eights were then piled up 15 minutes later
 encounter par police kaa bayaanraat ko sava teen baje jail ke andar jail prashasan ko khabar mili ki simi se jude aathatankwaadi gelse bhaag nikle hai
 a head constable also cut his throat before running away
 bhopal local police, sitiji or estf kii timen thik isi jagah un aathon aatankwaadiyon ko dher kar detii hai jo aath ghante pehle hi jail todakar bhaage the
 After this encounter, Bhopal police gave a shocking statement
 bakaul police aathon aatankwaadi aatmaraksha ke dauraan maare gaye
 Because on seeing the police team, they started firing on the police
 hathiyaar kaa maamla gambhipub sawaal ye he ki jail se bhaage aathatankwaadi encountermen maare gaye
 Then when did he come out of jail, where did his weapons come from during the next eight hours? Did they arrange weapons in advance? What weapons did he bring from prison? Because if they had weapons in jail itself, they would not make sharp-edged weapons by cutting steel plates or glass to cut the head constable's throat
 yani saaf he ki agar unke paas hathiyaar tha to wo unhen jail ke baahar mila
 But who gave them the weapon as soon as they came out of the jail? There is no way forward from the hill where Yenkaounterhua is near
 yahaan se sirf aap kudakar hi neeche ja sakate hai or pahari se kudane kaa matlab sidhe maut he
 Now the question is that instead of leaving the city after escaping from jail, why were the eight terrorists waiting in a dead end place and waiting for the police? All the eight terrorists were locked in separate barracks, the student unit of the SIMI (student Islamic Movement of India) These are the eight terrorists who were killed in a police encounter
 in aathon par desh ke kai shaharon main bam dhamaakon or duusare sangeen iljaam the
 The case is still going on in court
 lihaaja aathon andertrial yani vichaaradhin kaidi ke taur par hai sicurity vaali bhopal central jail main band the
 All eight were not together inside the jail
 balki inhen alag-alag baiyrakon main rakhaa gaya tha
 According to the jail administration, they ran away from the jail between 12 noon and 2 pm on the night of eight Diwali
 kambal or chadar kii rassi banaakar faandi deevargel prashasan kaa kahana he ki aathon ne jail se bhaagane ke liye jail kii bees feet oonchi diwaar ko kambal or chadar kii rassi bana kar paar kiya
 During the escape, he killed the throat constable of a head constable
 sawaal ye ki bees feet oonchi diwaar ko kambal or chadar kii rassi banaakar duusare sire par use kaise atakaya hoga
 Three of the terrorists who were killed in Bhopal Central Jail and then in the encounter, three of them had escaped from Khandwa jail in Madhya Pradesh in 2013
 haalanki tab 12 ghante ke andar unhen dobaaraa pakad liya gaya tha
 Since the same incident, most of the terrorists associated with SIMI were shifted to Bhopal Central Jail

 coach dancan flechar ke liye team india se jane kaa vakt aa gaya he
 This is what Team India's results say with them
 purv captain sunil gavaskar ne khul kar dancan flechar ke kilaaf morcha khol diya he
 Gavaskar says that the time has come to change the coach for Team India, whatever the outcome of the T20 World Cup in Bangladesh
 vah chaahate hai ki team kaa coach aisa hona chahie jo yuva ho or jisamen urja ho
 That is, the demand for 65-year-old Duncan Fletcher's farewell has begun to pick up
 aise main ek saath kai sawaal uth khadey hue hai
 Will Duncan Fletcher farewell soon? Will the team get any young coach? Will there be a change before the 2015 World Cup? sunil gavaskar kehete hai ki bhartiya team ko is vakt ek aise yuva coach kii zarurat he jo team ke saath aage badhkar kaam karne ko taiyaar ho
 No one is going to drag his feet on occasion
 ek yuva coach khilaadiyon main behatar talmail bitha saktaa he or unhen disha de saktaa he
 Australia has set a precedent by reversing the team in a few months with a new youth coach
 aisa nahin he ki team india ke coach ko lekar ye sirf sunil gavaskar kii raay he
 Many stalwarts agree with Sunil Gavaskar's opinion
 gavaskar ne pehle team india ke work athiks ko lekar sawaal uthaae the or farukh ejeeniyar iske liye team captain yaa khilaadi se zyada coach ko zimmedaar maanate hai
 Farukh Engineer says that if the team does an optional practice then the coach should ask for the answer
 coach ko team ke abhyaas ko lekar anushaasan dikhaate hue kadaa rukh apnaanaa chahie
 According to Gavaskar, Team India could not play in the final of the Asia Cup, which further ruined the Indian team's record abroad
 fans agle saal australia−newzealand main hone vaale world cap main unase or kaise ummid karenge
 Farrukh believes that the coach has the responsibility to fix many of the team's deficiencies and show the team the right direction in which Coach Fletcher has failed
 farukh ejeeniyar kehete hai ki coach flechar ko itane paise milte hai to vah kya kaam karte hai
 The bowlers are not able to bowl the yorker in the death over, it is the coach's job to watch and tell that the bowler should put the yorker in the last over and not the good length ball
 team india newzealand main test or van-de series main buree tarah haari tab bhi captain dhoni or flechar ko lekar kai sawaal uthe
 It was also said that Andy Flower could become the next coach of Team India
 us vakt bisisiai ne ise sire se nakaar diya or coach fchilor kaa team or bisisiai ke saath qaraar ek saal ke liye bad gaya
 However, whether Fletcher will survive this time remains a question
