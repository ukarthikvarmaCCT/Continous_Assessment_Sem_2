 When Chris Gayle was asked if the Indian team could bowl Ashwin initially against him, he said that it is no longer a surprise, but captain Dhoni can do anything
 vah bahut anpridictable hai or bhartiya team main nehra or bumraah jaise or bhi achche gendbaaj shaamil hai, lekin kris gail hameshaa positive rahete hai, gail ke saamne yah myne nahin rakhata ki koun gendbaaji kar rahaa he

 This is the style of Chris Gayle and in his own cool attitude, he has warned Team India to bring any bowler in front of him, it does not matter to them
 kris gail kii team india ko chetavanee yaheen khatm nahin hui

 Taking a big step in the banking sector, the central government has announced the merger of several big banks
 vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman shuukravaar ko media se mukhaatib huin or banking sector main bade elaan kiye
 In the year 2017, there were 27 banks in the public sector, whose number will now come down to 12
 yah modi sarkaar ke pehle kaarykaal ke dauraan kii hi mahatvakankshi yojana he
 There are many doubts about the merger of public banks, although their experience seems to benefit the country so far
 esbiai se hui thi shuruyatsbase pehle esbiai main uske associat bainkon or mahila bank kaa vilay kiya gaya or uske baad bank of baroda, vijaya bank or dena bank kaa aapas main vilay kiya gaya
 After the merger, SBI joined the list of the 50 largest banks in the world
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki vilay ke baad banane vaale nae bank ke customer base, market main pahunch or sanchaalan main dakshata badhegi
 Apart from this, customers will get good services
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki bade bainkon ko arthvyavastha se bada laabh hota he or ve apni dakshata badhaane ke liye aasaani se cost kating kar sakate hai
 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that this will increase the customer reach
 bank kii kshamta badhegi, nivesh tej hoga or graahakon ko kisi tarah kii asuvidha nahin hogi
 Beneficial for Economy and Banking Having a large number of banks is not only beneficial for the economy, but also reduces their business costs
 purv vitt mantri arun jetali ne bhi kaha tha ki isse bank or majboot honge or unki karj dene kii kshamta badhegi
 Explaining the reasons for the merger, he had said that the investment of companies is being affected due to the weak lending situation of banks
 enpie ke sankat se muqablabanking sector ke kul non parforming esets (NPA) kaa kareeb 90 pratishat hissaa sarkari bainkon kaa he
 The banking sector had an NPA of about Rs 8 lakh crore in the last financial year, which according to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is now 7
 90 lakh karod rupee rah gaya he
 Given the NPA crisis, the merger of weak banks also means that the number of banks will be lower, but they will be better on capital basis and they will be easier to monitor
 bade bainkon ke paas zyada puunji hoti he
 It is easy for the government and regulators to assist them
 sarkaar sankat main aasaani se inaki madad kar sakati he or unhen doobane se bachaa sakati he
 Apart from this, big banks can also manage cash better
 bainkon ke vilay se unka sammilit kaarobaar kaaphi bad jaataa he
 This makes their npas manageable overall
 unke paas kam laagat ke jamaa or bafer capital bad jaataa he
 Not having any adverse effect on customers, people believe that if weak banks merge with strong banks, then there is a deal for the customers
 majboot bank khataadharakon ke liye lambii avadhi main jamaa par zyada aakarshak byaaj de sakate hai or karj kii daren bhi kam kar sakate hai
 The merger process may take at least 4 to 6 months
 sambandhit bainkon kii shakhaon ko nayaa naam milegaa or unke IFSC code bhi badal jaaenge
 However, there will be no impact on the customers of these banks as the process will run in a phased manner
 bataa den ki esbiai main uske associats bainkon ke vilay kii prakriya lambey vakt main puri hui thi or iske baavjood customer sarvice prabhavit nahin hui thi
 The Finance Minister has said that customers will not take any kind of inconvenience, care will be taken, they will have a lot of branches
 sasta ho saktaa he karjajankaron kaa maananaa he ki short turm main bhale hi bainkon ke khataadharakon kii maujuuda nivesh yojana yaa zyaadaatar karj skiimon kii dar par koi fark na pade, lekin nae or vishaal bank lambii avadhi main jamaa par acchhee byaaj dar kii peshkash kar sakate hai, kyonki nae bank kii parisampatti zyada hogi, enpie kam hoga or kaarobaar badhegaa
 Banks can reduce loan rates like home loans, auto loans
 berogari badhane kii ashankavilay kii ghoshnaa hote hi aksar yah dekha gaya he ki karmchaaree virodh par utar jate hai
 Employees' unions say that the npas of banks are increasing, so merging banks will increase unemployment in the country
 iske pehle jab teen bainkon ke vilay kii ghoshnaa hui thi to bank unionon ne iskaa virodh kiya tha
 He claims that the merger of his 5 associate banks with the State Bank of India (SBI) was not a miracle
 us dauraan kai shakhaon ko band karnaa padaa tha
 The NPA was increased and the workforce was laid off
 saath hi state bank kaa kaarobaar bhi ghat gaya tha
 For the first time in 200 years, SBI was at a loss
 behatar bank ke karmchaariyon ko nuksaan!karmchaaree netaaon kaa maananaa he ki behatar vittiya halaat bade network ke kaaran karmchaariyon ko kai suvidhaayen milti hai jo vilay ke baad band ho sakati hai
 Large-scale bank personnel are transferred and lower-level personnel are at greater risk of losing their jobs

 In a letter written to President Pranab Mukherjee, Justice Verma's wife Pushpa has said, "the great honor given to him once again shows how he has kept a place in the hearts and minds of his countrymen
" ’ patr main kaha gaya he ‘unhone kabhi kisi sammaan ke liye na to laalasaa kii or na hi khmebandi kii
 We will not accept this honor because we know that Justice Verma himself does not accept it

 He will be remembered as one of the eminent judges of India and he has given the legacy which is in accordance with the new legal system operating around the world

 jab hamane iskaa kaaran jaananaa chaha to unhone bataaya ki unke pita ko padam vibhushan ke liye namankit kiya ja rahaa he

 Ever since the film's release, Twinkle has been continuously tweeting about updates and success related to the film

 The surprising thing is that before this film, Akshay Kumarki's big budget films of many big stars have failed to show something amazing at the box office or entice the audience
 jabaki toilet ek prem katha jaisi chote bajet kii film jo ek chote se gaanv main rahane vaale ek aam insaan kii jindagi par besd he darshakon ko khub bha rahi he
 With this, filmmakers and big stars should at least learn that viewers now expect better content from the stars

 ' is maukey par europea sansad ke sadsy jeeophri vaan orden, europea sansad kii upaadhyaksh katrina barle or purv saansad jo linen bhi maujuud rahe Amit Shah's claim- Naxalites wiped out in BJP rulecongress leader Subodh Kant questioned the Shah's claim, on the last day of campaigning for the first phase of the Jharkhand assembly elections, BJP President Amit Shah said while addressing a public meeting in Chatra, a Naxal-affected area
 This area was once Naxalite affected
 bijepi sarkaar aane ke baad naksaliyon kaa safaya ho gaya he
 Today no naxalite has the courage to make a mess
 hamane naksaliyon ko 20 feet neeche gaad diya
 Questioning the claim of Amit Shah, Congress veteran Subodh Kant Sahai said that the Election Commission says that 19 out of 24 districts of Jharkhand are Naxalite affected and BJP President Amit Shah is saying that the Naxalites are buried 20 feet below gave
 aise main amit shah jhooth bol rahe hai yaa phir chunaav ayog
 It should be clear who is right and who is wrong in these two
 bijepi adhyaksh or kendriya grih mantri amit shah ne chatra kii jansabha main apane sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon ko ginaya
 During this time, Shah said that this area was affected by Naxalism, until there was a BJP government here
 tab shaam hone ke baad koi baraat bhi gaanv main nahin jaati thi
 Today, he takes a procession in the evening on the injury of Danke
 kisi naksali kii himmat nahin he ki koi gadabad kare
 We buried the Naxalites 20 feet below the ground
 purv kendriya mantri or congress netaa subodh kaant sahay ne kaha ki amit shah kehete hai ki jharkhand se naksaliyon kaa safaya ho gaya he
 Naxalites are carted under 20 feet of ground
 jabaki, chunaav ayukta sunil aroda kehete hai ki jharkhand ke 24 main se 19 jile naksal prabhavit hai
 That is why elections are being held in five phases in the state
 unhone kaha ki abhi haal hi main naksaliyon ne chaar jawan or jeemem ke ek netaa ko maar diya
 Even after this, BJP President Amit Shah and Chief Minister Raghuvar Dasalgatar are saying that the Naxalites have been wiped out
 jabaki jharkhand main khuleam naksaliyon ne chunaav bahishkaar kaa parchaa baant rakhaa he
 In such a situation, who is lying and who is the truth? Let us know that in the first phase of Jharkhand, 13 assembly seats are to be voted on November 30
 yah ilaaka naksal prabhavit mana jaataa he or teen rajyon kii seemaa pehle charan vaale ilaake se milti he
 In such a situation, Jharkhand Election Officer Vipin Chaubey is taking cooperation with the Chief Secretary of the states adjoining Jharkhand

 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Congress's desire to hoist the flag in western UP through jat-muslim alliance has been shattered by the sentence of Qazi Rashid Masood
 medical seat ghotaale main masood ko sibiai court ne 4 saal kii sajaa sunai he
 Masood could be helpful in redeeming the pain arising from Muzaffarnagar for the party
 pashchimi upi ke ahm muslim netaa hai masudayah faisla us samay aayaa he jab congress party pashchimi upi ke is prabhavi muslim netaa ke boote mujffarnagar dange ke baad sapa ke virodh main upji muslimon kii naaraazgi ko bhunaane kii taiyaari kar rahi thi
 Several prominent Muslim organizations have demanded the dismissal of the SP government
 padhein:gujarat main asurakshit hai musalmaan: rashid masudpradhanmantri manmohan singh, congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi danga peediton par maraham lagaakar hamadardi bator chuke hai
 Rashid Masood could play an important role in converting this sympathy to the Congress vote
 vah dange main paidaa hue jakhm ko bhi bharne main kaam aa sakate the
 Now from where will the Congress bring the second National Lok Dal President Ajit Singh, the Congress was eyeing the jat-muslim votes
 congress jis chehre ko aage karke paracham lahraane kii taiyaari kar rahi thi, uske vivaadit ho jane se party kii sari ranneeti ek jatke main bighad gai
 No other leader with stature and experience like Masood is with the Congress in the West
 ab congress ke saamne sabase bada sankat yah he ki upi main kis muslim chehre ko aage karke chunaav ladaa jaae, khaskar pashchimi jilon main jahaan muslimon kii sabase zyada aabaadi he
 Congress does not have any strong Muslim leader who can prove these two parties helpful by directly attacking BJP and SP
 garmiyon kaa kahar har dhalate din ke saath lagaataar bad rahaa he
 In the summer, people also face many skin related problems with health
 vahiin, log jaldi dihydrate ho jate hai
 But you can avoid many problems in summer by making some changes in your dressing style
 aaie jaanate hai garmiyon ke mausam main kis tarah ke kapade pahananaa phydemand hota he
 1
 coton ke kapade pahanen-garmi ke mausam main kai logon ko jarurat se zyada pasinaa aata he
 Cotton clothes should be worn during summer season to avoid this problem
 ye paseene ko ebjorb kar ke use jaldi khushk karata he saath hi sharir se bacteria kii growth ko bhi kam karata he
 Wearing cotton clothes makes the body feel cool and it also controls infections
 isliye yah kahana galat nahin hoga ki garmiyon ke liye coton sabase best fabric he
 2
 synthetic fabric pahanane se bachein-garmiyon ke mausam main synthetic fabric pahanane se bachein, kyonki synthetic fabric main hawa paas nahin ho paati he, isliye pasinaa aane par wo suukhta nahin he or bacteria kii growth badhane se sharir se paseene kii badboo aane lagati he
 3
 halke rang ke kapade pahanen-garmiyon ke mausam main halke rang ke kapade jaise- safed, halke pile, hare, aasamaani rang ke hi kapade pahanen
 Light colored clothes feel cool in summer, as they do not absorb the heat of the sun
 jabaki gahare rang ke kapade zyada se zyada hit ebjorb kar ke aapako garmi kaa ehsaas karaate hai
 4
 deele kapade pahanen-garmiyon ke mausam main jitna ho sake tite kapade pahanane se bachein, kyonki isse blad cirkulation bigadataa he
 When this happens, there are many health problems
 isliye garmiyon ke mausam main sahi kapade hi chune

 iske baad se vah america se baahar hai
 Over 2 lakh people followed him within an hour of creating his Twitter account
 philhal yah sankhya 8
 Has crossed the 50 lakh mark and it is more than those following the nsa's Twitter handle

 He made the first tweet 'can you hear me now' on Twitter

 'see Snowden's first tweet Can you hear me now?' - Edward Snowden (@snowden) September 29, 2015 sansaadhan se lekar sampadakeey pasand jaise tamaam kaarnon se dilli se chalane vaale sthaneey kintu rashtriya kahalaane vaale channelon kii duniya main dakshin bharat or purvottar bharat kaa aagaman tabhi hota jab vahaan aisa kuch hota he jiskaa talulk bhashaa se kam ho, hallaa hangaamaa yaa tamaasha se zyaada ho
 There is no language of spectacle in today's media world
 tamaasha ho to hindi channelon par france kii ghatana bhi bharat kii zaruri khabaron se zyaada jagah gher legi
 Any Chinese road accidents recorded by CCTV are covered in the news of the local version in the channels world
 ye hota rahaa he, yahi hota rahegaa
 Neither you will change nor channel
 jab koi nahin badalegaa to ham kyon badal jaaen
 Recently, when the condition of Jayalalithaa became serious, there was a spectacle on the streets of Chennai
 police ai
 The weeping supporters came, the legislature party started meeting at a place, and all the news inside the hospital got sorted on the channels like a mystery
 aam taur par dakshin bharat kii rozaana kii taqalifon se dur rahane vaale hindi channelon par chennai haaavee ho gaya
 People gathered on the streets of Chennai, police tension and crowds of millions gathered at the sea shore for the last rites
 gambhir or dukhad jhanon main bhi inhen tamaashe kii tarah hi uttar bharat ke darshakon kii duniya main thela gaya
 Because it did not require language
 aap ghar baithe sirf hangaame ke drishy dekh rahe the or bina gaharaai se jane dakshin bharat kii raajnneeti ke bare main jaagruk ho rahe the
 If there was no spectacle in all these moments, then hardly any Hindi channels or global channels running from Delhi would care what has happened in the south
 chennai se aage kii kahani to shaayad hi kabhi aati hogi
 Yes, if there is a spectacle about the Cauvery water agreement, hundreds of buses burn, people commit suicide then Tamil Nadu can take over TV again
 isamen aap darshakon kaa koi dosha nahin he
 TV is also not to blame
 na hi patrakarita kaa
 The fault is probably that of a tamasha who has no language
 tamaasha hi wo tatv he jo dilli se chalane vaale channelon ko chennai main badal detaa he or chennai se chalane vaale channelon ko imphal main
 So many times you have to leave your language and do the spectacle
 magar har baar tamaasha tamaasha nahin hota
 It is a concern within you
 bebasii, bechaini, laachaari hoti he
 Suppose you are Hindi speaking
 chennai main rahete hai yaa kerala main rahete hai
 Two is the number of four thousand
 hindi ke alaava koi bhashaa nahin aati
 But you are angry with any government policy
 zaahir he aap awaz uthaaenge
 Posters will come to Marina Beach with banners so that the convoy of ministers passing by can see you
 ho saktaa he ki un mantriyon ko hindi nahin aati ho
 People passing by do not know Hindi
 aapke poster or us par likhe hamaari maange puri karo ke naare bekaar ho jate hai
 You wish someone could read it
 samaj le ki ham kya kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, you will surely suffer, seek someone that will get off the bus, and will read the language of us and tell the government or the press what we are saying
 jab kuch nahin hoga tab aap kuch or aisa karenge jisase logon kii nazar pade ki kyon 100-200 log pradarshan kar rahe hai
 You will feel alone in your own country
 chikhenge, chillaayenge
 In the end, you will start playing different kinds of spectacle
 harakatein karenge
 Will take clothes off
 aag par chalenge
 Will sing the song
 aap khud ko bhashaa ke paar le jaayenge
 Many times when the students of the Northeast reach Jantar Mantar, the way in which they call the journalists, they can guess their yearning
 wo har kisi ko phone karte hai
 Do not know Hindi but speak English
 phir tuuti phooti hindi main bolte hai
 Someone will reach them, they will bring their talk to the country and the government through the media
 is tarah kaa phone jab bhi aata he, duusari taraf awaz kii bebasii daraati he
 If you find me too heavy, then make it easier
 dilli ke jantar mantar par qatari baddh baithe logon ko dekhiye
 They do not have the language for the media of Delhi
 isliye unhone apane sharir ko hi bhashaa kaa rup de diya he
 His body, his clothes are speaking
 ham sabane isi jantar mantar par dilli ke aas paas ke kisaanon kaa hujum dekha he, magar tamilnadu ke kisaanon ko shaayad nahin dekha he
 They do not know Hindi
 kuch kuch angrezi bol rahe hai magar wo bhi mushkil se
 So they have taken off their clothes
 mahilaayein sirf hare rang ke peticot main hai
 Men in green lungi
 hamane ye sawaal poocha ki haraa rang kyon
 The answer was green because it is the color of the farmers
 dharti kaa rang he
 The politics of North India is taking the idea of kesariya as Hindu and Hare as Muslim, but the farmers of the south are describing Hare as the color of the farmer
 ye kisaan dharm se baahar nahin he
 Tripund is made on everyone's body
 shiv ke bhakt malmu padate hai
 Some farmers have taken a bowl in hand
 angrezi main likhaa he begar yani bhikhaari
 It is written in English so that Delhi can understand
 bhikhaari banakar wo apni baat angrezi main aap tak pahunchaana chaahate hai
 Their banners are also not in Tamil
 angrezi main hai
 Some farmers put garland of Narmund in the neck
 ye pratik he un kisaanon kaa jinhone karze or kheti ke sankat se tang aakar aatmahatya kar lee he
 These farmers, numbering 100, are raising slogans in Tamil
 shaayad hi isaki awaz dilli ke aas paas ke kisaanon tak pahunche
 The farmer in India does not speak for the farmer
 shahar kisaan ke liye nahin bolte he
 Even if the language of slogans changes, the people listening to them do not change
 hamaare sahyogi munne bharti ne bahut prayaas kiya kisi se baat ho jaae
 Neither Munne could speak English nor Hindi
 donon taraf ek bich kii bhashaa bachi hui thi angrezi jisase ham kai baar nakli bhashaai swabhimaan ke naam par chidhate hai
 Who thought that debt-laden farmers, farmers who committed suicide, would have to resort to English
 marathi, punjabi, tamil sab bhashaaon ne kisaanon ko chhod diya he
 Delhi has its own horror of English
 dilli vaali angrezi kasbe vaali angrezi ko daraati he
 Munne Bharti talked to a farmer
 wo kya bol rahe hai ye mat suniye
 Look at the breakdown in how they are speaking
 agar aapako ye topic heavi lagata he to aap kuch or bhi dekhiye
 a large number of people of Tamil Nadu live in Delhi
 kabhi afasar banakar aae or dakshin dilli ke aarake puram main rahane lage
 After retiring from there, he settled towards Mayur Vihar
 or bhi kai jagahon par based hue hai
 These people told that the people of Tamil Nadu are coming and arranging for food
 samarthan jataa rahe hai
 It is also good that the people of this city are going among them, only ten to five
 yahi to hamaari khubi he
 As i said in TV, South India happens on the same occasions when there is a spectacle
 varna ham hindi kii duniya main kahaan tamilnadu ko lekar chintit hote hai ki vahaan pichley chaar maheene main chaar sau kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 The Human Rights Commission, which sits in Delhi, has sent a notice to the state government on 5 January based on the press report there
 tamil dainik ne 3 janvari 2017 ko khabar chhaapi he ki dil kaa daura padane se 83 kisaanon kii maut hui he
 The same newspaper has reported on 5 January 2017 that the death toll of farmers has reached 106 in a month
 ayog ne likhaa tha ki niti banane vaale kisaanon ko nazarandaaz kar rahe hai
 Farmers need to be removed from the farming crisis
 usee vakt madras hoicourt ne bhi chaar hafton ke bheetar tamilnadu sarkaar ko halafanama daayar karne ke liye kaha tha ki sarkaar bataaye ki wo kya aisa karne ja rahi he jisase kisaanon kii aatmahatya ruk sake
 According to media reports, Tamil Nadu is in severe drought
 ham uttar bharatiyon ke liye to abhi garmi bhi nahin ai he magar dakshin ke hamaare priy rajya main sookhaa he
 The state government sought 39,565 crore help to deal with the drought
 ise aap package samajhate hai
 a drought has been declared in Tamil Nadu
 is saal northeast main barish 62 pratishat kam hui he
 This is the first time since 1876 there has been so little rain
 100 saal main pehali baar aisa sankat aayaa he phir bhi is sookhe kii daastaan aap tak laane ke liye kisi ko jantar mantar par nange badan khadey hona padataa he
 The water of Mettur Dam has reduced very much, the farmer can neither look towards the land nor look at the sky
 jantar mantar par jo kisaan aae hai unke paas bahut khet nahin hai
 All are small farmers
 inaki kuch maangen hai
 These farmers are going on hunger strike for 100 days
 inke paas hindi main ek parchaa he jis par sabase upar likhaa he, 'kisaan, jo raashtra ko ann dete hai, unki aatmahatya ko rokna
 Stop Tamil Nadu from becoming a desert
 kaveri nadi ko sookhne se rokna
 Constitution of Management Committee for Cauvery River
 krishi utpaadon ke liye uchit laabhadaayak mulya kaa nirdhaaran
 ' parche main yah bhi likhaa he, dukh ke saath bhukh hadtaal
 The name of the organization is South Indian Nadia Farmers Association
 hamaare liye to yah naam bhi nayaa he
 Nadia Farmers Association
 ye log nadiyon ko jodne kii maang karte hai
 In the morning Jantar Mantar came to show any support for these agitators
 unhone hamaare liye hindi main inaki samasya ko saamne rakhaa he
 Looking at the issue of farmers for so many days, one thing has been understood
 bharat ke kisaan laachaar nahin hai
 Farmers of India know how to make political decisions
 ve apane sankaton ke hisaab se raajnneetik faisla nahin karte hai balki puure samaaj ke liye faisla karte hai
 Otherwise farmers in many states do not vote for any political party
 jantar mantar par hi apane saamaan ke saath tamilnadu ke ye kisaan date hue hai
 Jantar Mantar is the real capital
 bharat kii samasyaon kaa ekmaatr pratinidhi sthal
 The Jantar Mantar that governments have imposed on the people, can only be the site of liberation from Jantar Mantar
 bharat main loktantr zindaa he jab tak jantar mantar zindaa he
 That is why this farmer lies on the bare open road
 kisaanon ko bhi neend aati he
 For three to four days, such rum has been lost as if it was Jantar Mantar
 ye jagah hi inke liye khet he
 Farmers suicide, drought crisis cover us all
 aisi koi baat nahin jiske bare main sarkaar ko na maaloom ho, patrkaar ne na likhaa ho
 The farmers are not getting the price
 kabhi kabhi muaavze mil jate hai
 Sometimes the loan gets forgiven
 lekin sankat or sookhaa har saal yaa har duusare saal laut aata he
 In Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu got the disease if the drought eradicated from the rains
 jab bhi koi suicide karata he, use pichhali suicide ke saath jod diya jaataa he
 106 farmers committed suicide
 yah kisaan 107waan tha
 Therefore, the suffering of the farmers is now beyond language
 jin logon ko bhashaa par bahut bharosa hota he unhen shuukravaar ke indian express ke pehle panne par chhapi bashaarat masood kii report padhani chahie
 The language of Kupwara of Kupwara in Kashmir was not even given a chance
 'maa kii bahon main so rahi thi
 His brother was sleeping next door
 ek goli ai jo kaniza ko khamosh kar gai
 The mother felt something sticky when she extended her hand towards the daughter
 gaur se dekha to bistar par koon failaa hua tha
 Kaniza had left this world
 baahar goli chal rahi thi
 Terrorists were hiding near Kaniza's house which was surrounded by security forces
 goli kiski bandook se chali pataa nahin chalaa
 But Kaniza, who was sleeping in another house, was killed
 uskaa bhai faisal bhi vahiin so rahaa tha
 got injured
 police waalon ne madad kii or astpal le jaaya gaya
 Faizal's life is saved but due to being in the hospital, Kaniza could not even see for the last time
 kashmir kii samasya bhi kisaanon kii samasya kii tarah he
 Everyone knows the crisis
 samaadhaan kisi ko nahin
 Now their problems have been overcome by language
 hamaari samvedanheenata kii koi bhashaa nahin he
 We have become like a bullet who silently kills a twelve-year-old girl and bounces her bed
 agar kaniza kii maa kii takalif ke liye koi bhashaa he to bataaiye
 Ask that language what Kaniza, who was sleeping, said when she was shot
 vahiin to uski maa so rahi thi
 His brother was sleeping there
 tippaniyan 'I loved Kaniza very much
 mere chaar bete hai
 i was the only daughter
 mere daahine haath par sar rakhkar so rahi thi
 Achaakan he breathed in shock
 maine uske badan par apana haath rakhaa to chipchipa sa laga
 When i saw my hands, i was red with blood
 maine kambal phenkaa to dekha ki chaaron taraf koon failaa hua tha
 The blood was flowing from her and Faizal's body
 ' ye kaniza kii maa kaa bayaan he jinhone indian express ke bashaarat masood ko isi tarah bataaya he ki kaise uski iklauti or behad pyaari beti kaniza maar di gai
 Nazir Masudi of NDTV also reached Kaniza's house
 ek reporter ke liye kitna mushkil hota hoga aise vakt main logon se samvaad bananaa
 It is a dark room
 kaniza ke bhai khofazada hai
 Where the sister has gone suddenly is out of their comprehension
 13 saal ke asalam or 10 saal ke zafar kii ankhon main sab he magar unki bahan nahin he
 The house was far away but the bullets cover the distance
 ek hafte ke bheetar yah duusari ghatana he
 In Pulwama too, a child died of an encounter bullet
 15 saal kaa tha, maaraa gaya
 On 5 March, four children were injured in an explosion near the security forces camp in Sopore
 sabake paas daleelein hongi
 There will be some Kashmir experts
 kuch sakht bayaan honge
 All these bullets find their way
 wo kisi aatankwaadi kaa peechha karte karte rasta badal leti he
 What did Kaniza know
 
 
 
 a bullet is coming up to his bed
 haal hi main jab jayalalita kii haalat gambhir hui to chennai kii sadakon par tamaasha hua
 Police came rote bilakhte samarthak aae, kisi thikaane par vidhayak dal kii baithak hone lagi to aspataal ke bheetar kii tamaam khabaren kisi rahasy kii tarah channelon par chaane lageen
 Chennai generally dominated the Hindi channels, which remained away from the daily hassles of South India
 chennai kii sadakon par jamaa log, police kaa tanaav or antim sanskaar ke liye samandar ke kinare umadi lakhon kii bheed
 In severe and tragic scenes, like the spectacle, they were jammed into the world of the viewers of North India
 kyonki iske liye bhashaa kii zarurat nahin thi
 You were sitting at home just watching the uproar and becoming aware of the politics of South India without going deep into it
 agar inhen sab lamhon main tamaasha na hota to shaayad hi hindi channel yaa dilli se chalane vaale kisi bhi bhashaa ke global channel isaki parvaah karte ki dakshin main kya hua he
 The story ahead of Chennai will rarely come
 haa agar kaveri jal samjhaute ko lekar tamaasha ho jaae, saikadon basen jal jaaen, log aatmadah kar len to phir se tamilnadu tivi par chaa saktaa he
 There is no fault of you audience in this
 dosha tivi kaa bhi nahin he
 Nor of journalism
 dosha shaayad us tamaashe kaa he jisaki koi bhashaa nahin hoti he
 The pageant is the element that converts the channels running from Delhi to Chennai and the channels running from Chennai to Imphal
 isliye kai baar aapako apni bhashaa chhodkar tamaasha karnaa padataa he
 But every time a spectacle is not a spectacle
 wo aapke bheetar kii chitkaar hota he
 There is helplessness, restlessness, helplessness
 maan lijie aap hindi bhashi hai
 Live in Chennai or live in Kerala
 do chaar hazaar kii sankhya he
 There is no language other than Hindi
 magar aap sarkaar kii kisi niti se naaraaz hai
 Obviously you will raise your voice
 poster binar lekar marina bich par aa jaaenge taaki vahaan se guzarate mantriyon kaa kafila aapako dekh len
 May be those ministers do not know Hindi
 aas paas se guzarate logon ko hindi nahin aati ho
 The slogans of your poster and our demands written on it, become useless
 aapako lagata he ki kaash koi pard le
 Understand what we are doing
 aisi sthiti main yakeenan aap tadap uthenge, kisi aise kii talash karenge ki koi to bas se utrega or hamaari bhashaa padhakar sarkaar yaa press ko ittala kar degaa ki ham kya kah rahe hai
 When nothing happens, you will do something else that will make people see why 100-200 people are performing
 aap apane hi mulk main akelaa mahasoos karenge
 Will scream, scream
 ant main tarah tarah kaa tamaasha karne lagenge
 Will do things kapade utaarenge
 Will walk on fire
 geet gaayenge
 You will take yourself across the language
 kai baar purvottar ke chaatr jab jantar mantar pahunchate hai to jis andaaz main wo patrakaron ko phone karte hai, usase unki tadap kaa andaaza hota he
 They call everyone
 hindi nahin aati magar angrezi main bolte hai
 Then speak broken Hindi
 koi to pahonchega, unki baat media ke zariye desh or sarkaar ke saamne laaegaa
 Whenever such a call comes, the voicelessness on the other side scares
 aapako meri baat baari bharkam lagati ho to ise or aasaan kar detaa hum
 Look at the people sitting in queues at Jantar Mantar in Delhi
 inke paas dilli kii media ke liye bhashaa nahin he
 That is why they have given their bodies as language
 inkaa sharir, inke kapade bol rahe hai
 We have all seen the farmers around Delhi at this Jantar Mantar, but have not seen the farmers of Tamil Nadu
 inhen hindi nahin aati he
 Some are speaking English but they are also barely
 lihaaza inhone apane kapade utaar diye hai
 The women are just in green petticoats
 mard hare rang kii lungi main
 We asked the question why green
 jawaab mila haraa rang isliye kyonki ye kisaanon kaa rang he
 Is the color of the earth
 uttar bharat kii raajnneeti kesaria ko hindu or hare ko muslim samajhane main lagi he, magar dakshin ke kisaan hare ko kisaan kaa rang bataa rahe hai
 This farmer is not out of religion
 sabake badan par tripund bana he
 Shiva's devotees fall in love
 kuch kisaanon ne haath main katoraa liya he
 It is written in English that Beggar means beggar
 angreji main likhaa he taaki dilli samaj sake
 As a beggar, he wants to convey his words in English to you
 inke binar tamil main bhi nahin hai
 Are in English
 kuch kisaanon ne gale main narmund kii maala daal lee
 It is the symbol of those farmers who have committed suicide by being fed up with debt and farming crisis
 100 kii sankhya main aae ye kisaan tamil main naare laga rahe hai
 Hardly its voice reached the farmers around Delhi
 bharat main kisaan kisaan ke liye nahin bolta he
 The city does not speak for the farmer
 naaron kii bhashaa badal bhi jaati to bhi inhen sunne vaale log nahin badalte
 Our colleague Munne Bharti tried hard to talk to someone
 na munne angrezi bol sakate the na wo hindi
 There was a middle language left on both sides, English which we sometimes tease in the name of fake linguistic self-respect
 kisne sochaa tha ki karz se laden kisaanon ko, aatmahatya karne waalon kisaanon ko angrezi kaa sahaara lenaa padegaa
 Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil have all left the farmers
 dilli kii angrezi kii apni alag dehshat he
 The English town of Delhi scares the English
 munne bharti ne ek kisaan se baat kii
 Do not listen to what they are saying
 kis tarah se bol rahe hai, unke bolne main jo tuutan he, use dekhiye
 If you find this topic heavy, then see something else
 dilli main kaaphi sankhya main taminladu ke log rahete hai
 Sometimes came as an officer and started living in RK Puram in South Delhi
 vahaan se ritair hue to mayur vihaar kii taraf jaakar bas gaye
 Many more are inhabited
 in logon ne bataaya ki tamilnadu ke log aakar khaane pine kaa intazaam kar de rahe hai
 Are showing support ye bhi acha he ki das paanch hi sahi, is shahar ke log inke bich ja rahe hai
 This is our quality jaisaa ki maine kaha ki tivi main dakshin bharat unheen maukon par hota he jab tamaasha hota he
 Otherwise, where in the Hindi world are we concerned about Tamil Nadu, that in the last four months, four hundred farmers have committed suicide
 dilli main baithne vaale manvidhakaar ayog ne 5 janvari ko rajya sarkaar ko vahaan kii press report ke aadhaar par notice bheja he
 The Tamil daily reported on 3 January 2017 that 83 farmers had died due to heart attack
 usee akhbaar ne 5 janvari 2017 ko bataaya he ki ek maheene main kisaanon kii maut kaa aankada 106 par pahunch gaya he
 The Commission wrote that policy makers are ignoring farmers
 kisaanon ko kheti ke sankat se nikaalane kii zarurat he
 At the same time, the Madras High Court had also asked the Tamil Nadu government to file an affidavit within four weeks that the government should tell what it was going to do to stop the farmers' suicide
 media report ke anusaar tamilnadu main bhayankar sookhaa he
 We are not even hot for North Indians, but there is a drought in our beloved state of South
 rajya sarkaar ne sookhaa se nipatane ke liye 39,565 karod kii madad maangi
 You consider it a package
 tamilnadu main sookhaa ghoshit kar diya gaya he
 The rainfall in the Northeast has come down by 62 percent this year
 1876 ke baad pehali baar itani kam barish hui he
 For the first time in 100 years, such a crisis has come, yet one has to stand bare body at Jantar Mantar to bring the story of this drought to you
 mettoor baandh kaa pani bahut kam ho gaya he, kisaan na zamin kii taraf dekh saktaa he na aasmaan kii taraf taak saktaa he
 The farmers who have come to Jantar Mantar do not have much fields
 chote kisaan hi hai saare
 They have some demands
 ye kisaan 100 dinon ke liye bhukh hadtaal kar rahe hai
 They have a pamphlet in Hindi on which it is written at the top, 'farmers, who give food to the nation, to stop their suicide
 tamilnadu ko registan banane se rokna
 To prevent the Cauvery River from drying up
 kaveri nadi ke liye prabandhan samiti kaa gathan
 Determination of fair profitable prices for agricultural products
 ' It is also written in the pamphlet, hunger strike with sorrow
 sanghathan kaa naam he dakshin bhartiya nadiya kisaan sangh
 This name is also new to us
 nadiya kisaan sangh
 These people demand to connect the rivers
 subah jantar mantar par in andolankariyon ke liye koi samarthan jataane aayaa tha
 They have put their problem in front of us in Hindi
 itane dinon se kisaanon ke masale ko dekhte hue ek baat samaj ai he
 The farmers of India are not helpless
 bharat ke kisaan raajnneetik faisla karnaa jaanate hai
 They do not make political decisions according to their crises, but for the whole society
 varna kai rajyon main kisaan kisi raajnneetik dal ke liye vot hi nahin karte
 These farmers of Tamil Nadu are stuck with their belongings at Jantar Mantar itself
 jantar mantar hi asli rajdhani he
 The only representative site of India's problems
 sarkaron ne janata par jo jantar mantar kiya he, usase mukti kaa sthal jantar mantar hi ho saktaa he
 Democracy in India is alive as long as Jantar Mantar is alive
 tabhi to ye kisaan nange badan khuli sadak par let gaya he
 Farmers also get sleep
 teen chaar dinon se aise ram gaye hai jaise jantar mantar hi inkaa ghar ho
 This place is the farm for them
 kisaanon kii aatmahatya, sookhe kaa sankat ham sab cover karte hai
 There is nothing that the government does not know about, the journalist has not written
 kisaanon ko daam nahin mil rahe hai
 Sometimes compensation is received
 kabhi kabhaar karza maaf ho jaataa he
 But the crisis and drought returns every year or every other year
 maharashtra main barish se sookhe ne mukti pai to tamilnadu ko yah rog lag gaya
 Whenever someone commits suicide, it is added to the previous suicide
 106 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii
 This farmer was 107th
 isliye kisaanon kii takaleef ab bhashaa ke paar he
 Those who have great faith in the language should read Basharat Masood's report printed on the front page of Friday's Indian Express
 kashmir ke kupwada kii kaniza ko to bhashaa ne uf karne tak kaa mauka nahin diya
 'sleeping in mother's arms
 bagal main uskaa bhai so rahaa tha
 a bullet arrived which silenced Kaniza
 maa ne jab apana haath beti kii taraf badhaayaa to kuch chipchipa sa mahasoos hua
 If i looked closely, the blood was spread on the bed
 kaniza is duniya se ja chuki thi
 Bullet was going on outside
 kaniza ke ghar ke paas main aatankwaadi chhipe the jinhen suraksha balon ne gher liya tha
 Whose gun shot was not known
 magar ek duusare ghar main so rahi kaniza ko maar gai
 His brother Faizal was also sleeping there
 ghayal ho gaya
 The policemen helped and Astpal was taken
 faisal kii jaan batch gai he magar aspataal main hone ke kaaran kaniza ko aakiri baar ke liye bhi nahin dekh paaya
 The problem of Kashmir is also like the problem of farmers
 sabko sankat maaloom he
 The solution is none
 ab unki takalif bhashaa ke paar ho chuki he
 There is no language of our insensitivity
 ham us goli kii tarah ho gaye hai jo ek baarah saal kii bacchee ko chupchaap maar kar, uske bistar ko lahooluhaan kar gaayab ho jate hai
 If there is any language for the suffering of Kaniza's mother, then tell it
 us bhashaa se puuchhiye ki neend main so rahi kaniza ne tab kya kaha tha, jab goli lagi thi
 His mother was sleeping there
 vahiin to uskaa bhai so rahaa tha
 The comments 'bahut pyaar karti thi kaniza ko
 i have four sons meri iklauti beti thi
 Sleeping with my head on my right hand
 achaakan usne jatke se saans lee
 When i put my hand on his body, it felt a bit sticky
 jab maine apni haathon ko dekha to koon se laal ho gaye the
 When i threw the blanket, i saw that there was blood all around
 uske or faijal ke badan se koon bah rahaa tha
 This is the statement of Kaniza's mother who told Basharat Masood of the Indian Express how his only and very dear daughter Kaniza was killed
 enditivi ke nazir masudi bhi kaniza ke ghar pahunche
 a reporter to communicate with people in such times
 andhera sa cameraa he
 Kaniza's brother is Kafzada
 bahan achaanak kahaan chali gai he ye unki samaj se baahar he
 13-year-old Aslam and 10-year-old Zafar all have eyes but their sister is not
 ghar dur tha magar goliyaan duuri tay kar leti hai
 This is the second incident within a week
 pulavama main bhi encounter kii goliyon kaa shikaar ek baccha ho gaya
 Was 15 years old, killed
 5 march ko sopor main suraksha balon ke camp ke nazadik visphot hone se chaar bachche ghayal ho gaye
 Everyone will have arguments
 kuch kashmir ke export honge
 There will be some hard statements
 in sabase goli apana rasta khoj leti he
 She changes the path chasing a terrorist
 kaniza ko kya pataa tha
 
 
 
 ek goli uske bistar tak aa rahi he
 The fault is probably that of a tamasha who has no language
 tamaasha hi wo tatv he jo dilli se chalane vaale channelon ko chennai main badal detaa he or chennai se chalane vaale channelon ko imphal main
 So many times you have to leave your language and do the spectacle
 magar har baar tamaasha tamaasha nahin hota
 It is a concern within you
 bebasii, bechaini, laachaari hoti he
 Suppose you are Hindi speaking
 chennai main rahete hai yaa kerala main rahete hai
 Two is the number of four thousand
 hindi ke alaava koi bhashaa nahin aati
 But you are angry with any government policy
 zaahir he aap awaz uthaaenge
 Posters will come to Marina Beach with banners so that the convoy of ministers passing by can see you
 ho saktaa he ki un mantriyon ko hindi nahin aati ho
 People passing by do not know Hindi
 aapke poster or us par likhe hamaari maange puri karo ke naare bekaar ho jate hai
 You wish someone could read it
 samaj le ki ham kya kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, you will surely suffer, seek someone that will get off the bus, and will read the language of us and tell the government or the press what we are saying
 jab kuch nahin hoga tab aap kuch or aisa karenge jisase logon kii nazar pade ki kyon 100-200 log pradarshan kar rahe hai
 You will feel alone in your own country
 chikhenge, chillaayenge
 In the end, you will start playing different kinds of spectacle
 harakatein karenge
 Will take clothes off
 aag par chalenge
 Will sing the song
 aap khud ko bhashaa ke paar le jaayenge
 Many times when the students of the Northeast reach Jantar Mantar, the way in which they call the journalists, they can guess their yearning
 wo har kisi ko phone karte hai
 Do not know Hindi but speak English
 phir tuuti phooti hindi main bolte hai
 Someone will reach them, they will bring their talk to the country and the government through the media
 is tarah kaa phone jab bhi aata he, duusari taraf awaz kii bebasii daraati he
 If you find me too heavy, then make it easier
 dilli ke jantar mantar par qatari baddh baithe logon ko dekhiye
 They do not have the language for the media of Delhi
 isliye unhone apane sharir ko hi bhashaa kaa rup de diya he
 His body, his clothes are speaking
 ham sabane isi jantar mantar par dilli ke aas paas ke kisaanon kaa hujum dekha he, magar tamilnadu ke kisaanon ko shaayad nahin dekha he
 They do not know Hindi
 kuch kuch angrezi bol rahe hai magar wo bhi mushkil se
 So they have taken off their clothes
 mahilaayein sirf hare rang ke peticot main hai
 Men in green lungi
 hamane ye sawaal poocha ki haraa rang kyon
 The answer was green because it is the color of the farmers
 dharti kaa rang he
 The politics of North India is taking the idea of kesariya as Hindu and Hare as Muslim, but the farmers of the south are describing Hare as the color of the farmer
 ye kisaan dharm se baahar nahin he
 Tripund is made on everyone's body
 shiv ke bhakt malmu padate hai
 Some farmers have taken a bowl in hand
 angrezi main likhaa he begar yani bhikhaari
 It is written in English so that Delhi can understand
 bhikhaari banakar wo apni baat angrezi main aap tak pahunchaana chaahate hai
 Their banners are also not in Tamil
 angrezi main hai
 Some farmers put garland of Narmund in the neck
 ye pratik he un kisaanon kaa jinhone karze or kheti ke sankat se tang aakar aatmahatya kar lee he
 These farmers, numbering 100, are raising slogans in Tamil
 shaayad hi isaki awaz dilli ke aas paas ke kisaanon tak pahunche
 The farmer in India does not speak for the farmer
 shahar kisaan ke liye nahin bolte he
 Even if the language of slogans changes, the people listening to them do not change
 hamaare sahyogi munne bharti ne bahut prayaas kiya kisi se baat ho jaae
 Neither Munne could speak English nor Hindi
 donon taraf ek bich kii bhashaa bachi hui thi angrezi jisase ham kai baar nakli bhashaai swabhimaan ke naam par chidhate hai
 Who thought that debt-laden farmers, farmers who committed suicide, would have to resort to English
 marathi, punjabi, tamil sab bhashaaon ne kisaanon ko chhod diya he
 Delhi has its own horror of English
 dilli vaali angrezi kasbe vaali angrezi ko daraati he
 Munne Bharti talked to a farmer
 wo kya bol rahe hai ye mat suniye
 Look at the breakdown in how they are speaking
 agar aapako ye topic heavi lagata he to aap kuch or bhi dekhiye
 a large number of people of Tamil Nadu live in Delhi
 kabhi afasar banakar aae or dakshin dilli ke aarake puram main rahane lage
 After retiring from there, he settled towards Mayur Vihar
 or bhi kai jagahon par based hue hai
 These people told that the people of Tamil Nadu are coming and arranging for food
 samarthan jataa rahe hai
 It is also good that the people of this city are going among them, only ten to five
 yahi to hamaari khubi he
 As i said in TV, South India happens on the same occasions when there is a spectacle
 varna ham hindi kii duniya main kahaan tamilnadu ko lekar chintit hote hai ki vahaan pichley chaar maheene main chaar sau kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 The Human Rights Commission, which sits in Delhi, has sent a notice to the state government on 5 January based on the press report there
 tamil dainik ne 3 janvari 2017 ko khabar chhaapi he ki dil kaa daura padane se 83 kisaanon kii maut hui he
 The same newspaper has reported on 5 January 2017 that the death toll of farmers has reached 106 in a month
 ayog ne likhaa tha ki niti banane vaale kisaanon ko nazarandaaz kar rahe hai
 Farmers need to be removed from the farming crisis
 usee vakt madras hoicourt ne bhi chaar hafton ke bheetar tamilnadu sarkaar ko halafanama daayar karne ke liye kaha tha ki sarkaar bataaye ki wo kya aisa karne ja rahi he jisase kisaanon kii aatmahatya ruk sake
 According to media reports, Tamil Nadu is in severe drought
 ham uttar bharatiyon ke liye to abhi garmi bhi nahin ai he magar dakshin ke hamaare priy rajya main sookhaa he
 The state government sought 39,565 crore help to deal with the drought
 ise aap package samajhate hai
 a drought has been declared in Tamil Nadu
 is saal northeast main barish 62 pratishat kam hui he
 This is the first time since 1876 there has been so little rain
 100 saal main pehali baar aisa sankat aayaa he phir bhi is sookhe kii daastaan aap tak laane ke liye kisi ko jantar mantar par nange badan khadey hona padataa he
 The water of Mettur Dam has reduced very much, the farmer can neither look towards the land nor look at the sky
 jantar mantar par jo kisaan aae hai unke paas bahut khet nahin hai
 All are small farmers
 inaki kuch maangen hai
 These farmers are going on hunger strike for 100 days
 inke paas hindi main ek parchaa he jis par sabase upar likhaa he, 'kisaan, jo raashtra ko ann dete hai, unki aatmahatya ko rokna
 Stop Tamil Nadu from becoming a desert
 kaveri nadi ko sookhne se rokna
 Constitution of Management Committee for Cauvery River
 krishi utpaadon ke liye uchit laabhadaayak mulya kaa nirdhaaran
 ' parche main yah bhi likhaa he, dukh ke saath bhukh hadtaal
 The name of the organization is South Indian Nadia Farmers Association
 hamaare liye to yah naam bhi nayaa he
 Nadia Farmers Association
 ye log nadiyon ko jodne kii maang karte hai
 In the morning Jantar Mantar came to show any support for these agitators
 unhone hamaare liye hindi main inaki samasya ko saamne rakhaa he
 Looking at the issue of farmers for so many days, one thing has been understood
 bharat ke kisaan laachaar nahin hai
 Farmers of India know how to make political decisions
 ve apane sankaton ke hisaab se raajnneetik faisla nahin karte hai balki puure samaaj ke liye faisla karte hai
 Otherwise farmers in many states do not vote for any political party
 jantar mantar par hi apane saamaan ke saath tamilnadu ke ye kisaan date hue hai
 Jantar Mantar is the real capital
 bharat kii samasyaon kaa ekmaatr pratinidhi sthal
 The Jantar Mantar that governments have imposed on the people, can only be the site of liberation from Jantar Mantar
 bharat main loktantr zindaa he jab tak jantar mantar zindaa he
 That is why this farmer lies on the bare open road
 kisaanon ko bhi neend aati he
 For three to four days, such rum has been lost as if it was Jantar Mantar
 ye jagah hi inke liye khet he
 Farmers suicide, drought crisis cover us all
 aisi koi baat nahin jiske bare main sarkaar ko na maaloom ho, patrkaar ne na likhaa ho
 The farmers are not getting the price
 kabhi kabhi muaavze mil jate hai
 Sometimes the loan gets forgiven
 lekin sankat or sookhaa har saal yaa har duusare saal laut aata he
 In Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu got the disease if the drought eradicated from the rains
 jab bhi koi suicide karata he, use pichhali suicide ke saath jod diya jaataa he
 106 farmers committed suicide
 yah kisaan 107waan tha
 Therefore, the suffering of the farmers is now beyond language
 jin logon ko bhashaa par bahut bharosa hota he unhen shuukravaar ke indian express ke pehle panne par chhapi bashaarat masood kii report padhani chahie
 The language of Kupwara of Kupwara in Kashmir was not even given a chance
 'maa kii bahon main so rahi thi
 His brother was sleeping next door
 ek goli ai jo kaniza ko khamosh kar gai
 The mother felt something sticky when she extended her hand towards the daughter
 gaur se dekha to bistar par koon failaa hua tha
 Kaniza had left this world
 baahar goli chal rahi thi
 Terrorists were hiding near Kaniza's house which was surrounded by security forces
 goli kiski bandook se chali pataa nahin chalaa
 But Kaniza, who was sleeping in another house, was killed
 uskaa bhai faisal bhi vahiin so rahaa tha
 got injured
 police waalon ne madad kii or astpal le jaaya gaya
 Faizal's life is saved but due to being in the hospital, Kaniza could not even see for the last time
 kashmir kii samasya bhi kisaanon kii samasya kii tarah he
 Everyone knows the crisis
 samaadhaan kisi ko nahin
 Now their problems have been overcome by language
 hamaari samvedanheenata kii koi bhashaa nahin he
 We have become like a bullet who silently kills a twelve-year-old girl and bounces her bed
 agar kaniza kii maa kii takalif ke liye koi bhashaa he to bataaiye
 Ask that language what Kaniza, who was sleeping, said when she was shot
 vahiin to uski maa so rahi thi
 His brother was sleeping there
 tippaniyan 'I loved Kaniza very much
 mere chaar bete hai
 i was the only daughter
 mere daahine haath par sar rakhkar so rahi thi
 Achaakan he breathed in shock
 maine uske badan par apana haath rakhaa to chipchipa sa laga
 When i saw my hands, i was red with blood
 maine kambal phenkaa to dekha ki chaaron taraf koon failaa hua tha
 The blood was flowing from her and Faizal's body
 ' ye kaniza kii maa kaa bayaan he jinhone indian express ke bashaarat masood ko isi tarah bataaya he ki kaise uski iklauti or behad pyaari beti kaniza maar di gai
 Nazir Masudi of NDTV also reached Kaniza's house
 ek reporter ke liye kitna mushkil hota hoga aise vakt main logon se samvaad bananaa
 It is a dark room
 kaniza ke bhai khofazada hai
 Where the sister has gone suddenly is out of their comprehension
 13 saal ke asalam or 10 saal ke zafar kii ankhon main sab he magar unki bahan nahin he
 The house was far away but the bullets cover the distance
 ek hafte ke bheetar yah duusari ghatana he
 In Pulwama too, a child died of an encounter bullet
 15 saal kaa tha, maaraa gaya
 On 5 March, four children were injured in an explosion near the security forces camp in Sopore
 sabake paas daleelein hongi
 There will be some Kashmir experts
 kuch sakht bayaan honge
 All these bullets find their way
 wo kisi aatankwaadi kaa peechha karte karte rasta badal leti he
 What did Kaniza know
 
 
 
 a bullet is coming up to his bed
 maan lijie aap hindi bhashi hai
 Live in Chennai or live in Kerala
 do chaar hazaar kii sankhya he
 There is no language other than Hindi
 magar aap sarkaar kii kisi niti se naaraaz hai
 Obviously you will raise your voice
 poster binar lekar marina bich par aa jaaenge taaki vahaan se guzarate mantriyon kaa kafila aapako dekh len
 May be those ministers do not know Hindi
 aas paas se guzarate logon ko hindi nahin aati ho
 The slogans of your poster and our demands written on it, become useless
 aapako lagata he ki kaash koi pard le
 Understand what we are doing
 aisi sthiti main yakeenan aap tadap uthenge, kisi aise kii talash karenge ki koi to bas se utrega or hamaari bhashaa padhakar sarkaar yaa press ko ittala kar degaa ki ham kya kah rahe hai
 When nothing happens, you will do something else that will make people see why 100-200 people are performing
 aap apane hi mulk main akelaa mahasoos karenge
 Will scream, scream
 ant main tarah tarah kaa tamaasha karne lagenge
 Will do things kapade utaarenge
 Will walk on fire
 geet gaayenge
 You will take yourself across the language
 kai baar purvottar ke chaatr jab jantar mantar pahunchate hai to jis andaaz main wo patrakaron ko phone karte hai, usase unki tadap kaa andaaza hota he
 They call everyone
 hindi nahin aati magar angrezi main bolte hai
 Then speak broken Hindi
 koi to pahonchega, unki baat media ke zariye desh or sarkaar ke saamne laaegaa
 Whenever such a call comes, the voicelessness on the other side scares
 aapako meri baat baari bharkam lagati ho to ise or aasaan kar detaa hum
 Look at the people sitting in queues at Jantar Mantar in Delhi
 inke paas dilli kii media ke liye bhashaa nahin he
 That is why they have given their bodies as language
 inkaa sharir, inke kapade bol rahe hai
 We have all seen the farmers around Delhi at this Jantar Mantar, but have not seen the farmers of Tamil Nadu
 inhen hindi nahin aati he
 Some are speaking English but they are also barely
 lihaaza inhone apane kapade utaar diye hai
 The women are just in green petticoats
 mard hare rang kii lungi main
 We asked the question why green
 jawaab mila haraa rang isliye kyonki ye kisaanon kaa rang he
 Is the color of the earth
 uttar bharat kii raajnneeti kesaria ko hindu or hare ko muslim samajhane main lagi he, magar dakshin ke kisaan hare ko kisaan kaa rang bataa rahe hai
 This farmer is not out of religion
 sabake badan par tripund bana he
 Shiva's devotees fall in love
 kuch kisaanon ne haath main katoraa liya he
 It is written in English that Beggar means beggar
 angreji main likhaa he taaki dilli samaj sake
 As a beggar, he wants to convey his words in English to you
 inke binar tamil main bhi nahin hai
 Are in English
 kuch kisaanon ne gale main narmund kii maala daal lee
 It is the symbol of those farmers who have committed suicide by being fed up with debt and farming crisis
 100 kii sankhya main aae ye kisaan tamil main naare laga rahe hai
 Hardly its voice reached the farmers around Delhi
 bharat main kisaan kisaan ke liye nahin bolta he
 The city does not speak for the farmer
 naaron kii bhashaa badal bhi jaati to bhi inhen sunne vaale log nahin badalte
 Our colleague Munne Bharti tried hard to talk to someone
 na munne angrezi bol sakate the na wo hindi
 There was a middle language left on both sides, English which we sometimes tease in the name of fake linguistic self-respect
 kisne sochaa tha ki karz se laden kisaanon ko, aatmahatya karne waalon kisaanon ko angrezi kaa sahaara lenaa padegaa
 Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil have all left the farmers
 dilli kii angrezi kii apni alag dehshat he
 The English town of Delhi scares the English
 munne bharti ne ek kisaan se baat kii
 Do not listen to what they are saying
 kis tarah se bol rahe hai, unke bolne main jo tuutan he, use dekhiye
 If you find this topic heavy, then see something else
 dilli main kaaphi sankhya main taminladu ke log rahete hai
 Sometimes came as an officer and started living in RK Puram in South Delhi
 vahaan se ritair hue to mayur vihaar kii taraf jaakar bas gaye
 Many more are inhabited
 in logon ne bataaya ki tamilnadu ke log aakar khaane pine kaa intazaam kar de rahe hai
 Are showing support ye bhi acha he ki das paanch hi sahi, is shahar ke log inke bich ja rahe hai
 This is our quality jaisaa ki maine kaha ki tivi main dakshin bharat unheen maukon par hota he jab tamaasha hota he
 Otherwise, where in the Hindi world are we concerned about Tamil Nadu, that in the last four months, four hundred farmers have committed suicide
 dilli main baithne vaale manvidhakaar ayog ne 5 janvari ko rajya sarkaar ko vahaan kii press report ke aadhaar par notice bheja he
 The Tamil daily reported on 3 January 2017 that 83 farmers had died due to heart attack
 usee akhbaar ne 5 janvari 2017 ko bataaya he ki ek maheene main kisaanon kii maut kaa aankada 106 par pahunch gaya he
 The Commission wrote that policy makers are ignoring farmers
 kisaanon ko kheti ke sankat se nikaalane kii zarurat he
 At the same time, the Madras High Court had also asked the Tamil Nadu government to file an affidavit within four weeks that the government should tell what it was going to do to stop the farmers' suicide
 media report ke anusaar tamilnadu main bhayankar sookhaa he
 We are not even hot for North Indians, but there is a drought in our beloved state of South
 rajya sarkaar ne sookhaa se nipatane ke liye 39,565 karod kii madad maangi
 You consider it a package
 tamilnadu main sookhaa ghoshit kar diya gaya he
 The rainfall in the Northeast has come down by 62 percent this year
 1876 ke baad pehali baar itani kam barish hui he
 For the first time in 100 years, such a crisis has come, yet one has to stand bare body at Jantar Mantar to bring the story of this drought to you
 mettoor baandh kaa pani bahut kam ho gaya he, kisaan na zamin kii taraf dekh saktaa he na aasmaan kii taraf taak saktaa he
 The farmers who have come to Jantar Mantar do not have much fields
 chote kisaan hi hai saare
 They have some demands
 ye kisaan 100 dinon ke liye bhukh hadtaal kar rahe hai
 They have a pamphlet in Hindi on which it is written at the top, 'farmers, who give food to the nation, to stop their suicide
 tamilnadu ko registan banane se rokna
 To prevent the Cauvery River from drying up
 kaveri nadi ke liye prabandhan samiti kaa gathan
 Determination of fair profitable prices for agricultural products
 ' It is also written in the pamphlet, hunger strike with sorrow
 sanghathan kaa naam he dakshin bhartiya nadiya kisaan sangh
 This name is also new to us
 nadiya kisaan sangh
 These people demand to connect the rivers
 subah jantar mantar par in andolankariyon ke liye koi samarthan jataane aayaa tha
 They have put their problem in front of us in Hindi
 itane dinon se kisaanon ke masale ko dekhte hue ek baat samaj ai he
 The farmers of India are not helpless
 bharat ke kisaan raajnneetik faisla karnaa jaanate hai
 They do not make political decisions according to their crises, but for the whole society
 varna kai rajyon main kisaan kisi raajnneetik dal ke liye vot hi nahin karte
 These farmers of Tamil Nadu are stuck with their belongings at Jantar Mantar itself
 jantar mantar hi asli rajdhani he
 The only representative site of India's problems
 sarkaron ne janata par jo jantar mantar kiya he, usase mukti kaa sthal jantar mantar hi ho saktaa he
 Democracy in India is alive as long as Jantar Mantar is alive
 tabhi to ye kisaan nange badan khuli sadak par let gaya he
 Farmers also get sleep
 teen chaar dinon se aise ram gaye hai jaise jantar mantar hi inkaa ghar ho
 This place is the farm for them
 kisaanon kii aatmahatya, sookhe kaa sankat ham sab cover karte hai
 There is nothing that the government does not know about, the journalist has not written
 kisaanon ko daam nahin mil rahe hai
 Sometimes compensation is received
 kabhi kabhaar karza maaf ho jaataa he
 But the crisis and drought returns every year or every other year
 maharashtra main barish se sookhe ne mukti pai to tamilnadu ko yah rog lag gaya
 Whenever someone commits suicide, it is added to the previous suicide
 106 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii
 This farmer was 107th
 isliye kisaanon kii takaleef ab bhashaa ke paar he
 Those who have great faith in the language should read Basharat Masood's report printed on the front page of Friday's Indian Express
 kashmir ke kupwada kii kaniza ko to bhashaa ne uf karne tak kaa mauka nahin diya
 'sleeping in mother's arms
 bagal main uskaa bhai so rahaa tha
 a bullet arrived which silenced Kaniza
 maa ne jab apana haath beti kii taraf badhaayaa to kuch chipchipa sa mahasoos hua
 If i looked closely, the blood was spread on the bed
 kaniza is duniya se ja chuki thi
 Bullet was going on outside
 kaniza ke ghar ke paas main aatankwaadi chhipe the jinhen suraksha balon ne gher liya tha
 Whose gun shot was not known
 magar ek duusare ghar main so rahi kaniza ko maar gai
 His brother Faizal was also sleeping there
 ghayal ho gaya
 The policemen helped and Astpal was taken
 faisal kii jaan batch gai he magar aspataal main hone ke kaaran kaniza ko aakiri baar ke liye bhi nahin dekh paaya
 The problem of Kashmir is also like the problem of farmers
 sabko sankat maaloom he
 The solution is none
 ab unki takalif bhashaa ke paar ho chuki he
 There is no language of our insensitivity
 ham us goli kii tarah ho gaye hai jo ek baarah saal kii bacchee ko chupchaap maar kar, uske bistar ko lahooluhaan kar gaayab ho jate hai
 If there is any language for the suffering of Kaniza's mother, then tell it
 us bhashaa se puuchhiye ki neend main so rahi kaniza ne tab kya kaha tha, jab goli lagi thi
 His mother was sleeping there
 vahiin to uskaa bhai so rahaa tha
 The comments 'bahut pyaar karti thi kaniza ko
 i have four sons meri iklauti beti thi
 Sleeping with my head on my right hand
 achaakan usne jatke se saans lee
 When i put my hand on his body, it felt a bit sticky
 jab maine apni haathon ko dekha to koon se laal ho gaye the
 When i threw the blanket, i saw that there was blood all around
 uske or faijal ke badan se koon bah rahaa tha
 This is the statement of Kaniza's mother who told Basharat Masood of the Indian Express how his only and very dear daughter Kaniza was killed
 enditivi ke nazir masudi bhi kaniza ke ghar pahunche
 How difficult it would be for a reporter to communicate with people in such times
 andhera sa cameraa he
 Kaniza's brother is Kafzada
 bahan achaanak kahaan chali gai he ye unki samaj se baahar he
 13-year-old Aslam and 10-year-old Zafar all have eyes but their sister is not
 ghar dur tha magar goliyaan duuri tay kar leti hai
 This is the second incident within a week
 pulavama main bhi encounter kii goliyon kaa shikaar ek baccha ho gaya
 Was 15 years old, killed
 5 march ko sopor main suraksha balon ke camp ke nazadik visphot hone se chaar bachche ghayal ho gaye
 Everyone will have arguments
 kuch kashmir ke export honge
 There will be some hard statements
 in sabase goli apana rasta khoj leti he
 She changes the path chasing a terrorist
 kaniza ko kya pataa tha
 
 
 
 ek goli uske bistar tak aa rahi he
 Many times when the students of the Northeast reach Jantar Mantar, the way in which they call the journalists, they can guess their yearning
 wo har kisi ko phone karte hai
 Do not know Hindi but speak English
 phir tuuti phooti hindi main bolte hai
 Someone will reach them, they will bring their talk to the country and the government through the media
 is tarah kaa phone jab bhi aata he, duusari taraf awaz kii bebasii daraati he
 If you find me too heavy, then make it easier
 dilli ke jantar mantar par qatari baddh baithe logon ko dekhiye
 They do not have the language for the media of Delhi
 isliye unhone apane sharir ko hi bhashaa kaa rup de diya he
 His body, his clothes are speaking
 ham sabane isi jantar mantar par dilli ke aas paas ke kisaanon kaa hujum dekha he, magar tamilnadu ke kisaanon ko shaayad nahin dekha he
 They do not know Hindi
 kuch kuch angrezi bol rahe hai magar wo bhi mushkil se
 So they have taken off their clothes
 mahilaayein sirf hare rang ke peticot main hai
 Men in green lungi
 hamane ye sawaal poocha ki haraa rang kyon
 The answer was green because it is the color of the farmers
 dharti kaa rang he
 The politics of North India is taking the idea of kesariya as Hindu and Hare as Muslim, but the farmers of the south are describing Hare as the color of the farmer
 ye kisaan dharm se baahar nahin he
 Tripund is made on everyone's body
 shiv ke bhakt malmu padate hai
 Some farmers have taken a bowl in hand
 angrezi main likhaa he begar yani bhikhaari
 It is written in English so that Delhi can understand
 bhikhaari banakar wo apni baat angrezi main aap tak pahunchaana chaahate hai
 Their banners are also not in Tamil

 Some farmers put garland of Narmund in the neck
 ye pratik he un kisaanon kaa jinhone karze or kheti ke sankat se tang aakar aatmahatya kar lee he
 These farmers, numbering 100, are raising slogans in Tamil
 shaayad hi isaki awaz dilli ke aas paas ke kisaanon tak pahunche
 The farmer in India does not speak for the farmer
 shahar kisaan ke liye nahin bolte he
 Even if the language of slogans changes, the people listening to them do not change
 hamaare sahyogi munne bharti ne bahut prayaas kiya kisi se baat ho jaae
 Neither Munne could speak English nor Hindi
 donon taraf ek bich kii bhashaa bachi hui thi angrezi jisase ham kai baar nakli bhashaai swabhimaan ke naam par chidhate hai
 Who thought that debt-laden farmers, farmers who committed suicide, would have to resort to English
 marathi, punjabi, tamil sab bhashaaon ne kisaanon ko chhod diya he
 Delhi has its own horror of English
 dilli vaali angrezi kasbe vaali angrezi ko daraati he
 Munne Bharti talked to a farmer
 wo kya bol rahe hai ye mat suniye
 Look at the breakdown in how they are speaking
 agar aapako ye topic heavi lagata he to aap kuch or bhi dekhiye
 a large number of people of Tamil Nadu live in Delhi
 kabhi afasar banakar aae or dakshin dilli ke aarake puram main rahane lage
 After retiring from there, he settled towards Mayur Vihar
 or bhi kai jagahon par based hue hai
 These people told that the people of Tamil Nadu are coming and arranging for food
 samarthan jataa rahe hai
 It is also good that the people of this city are going among them, only ten to five
 yahi to hamaari khubi he
 As i said in TV, South India happens on the same occasions when there is a spectacle
 varna ham hindi kii duniya main kahaan tamilnadu ko lekar chintit hote hai ki vahaan pichley chaar maheene main chaar sau kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 The Human Rights Commission, which sits in Delhi, has sent a notice to the state government on 5 January based on the press report there
 tamil dainik ne 3 janvari 2017 ko khabar chhaapi he ki dil kaa daura padane se 83 kisaanon kii maut hui he
 The same newspaper has reported on 5 January 2017 that the death toll of farmers has reached 106 in a month
 ayog ne likhaa tha ki niti banane vaale kisaanon ko nazarandaaz kar rahe hai
 Farmers need to be removed from the farming crisis
 usee vakt madras hoicourt ne bhi chaar hafton ke bheetar tamilnadu sarkaar ko halafanama daayar karne ke liye kaha tha ki sarkaar bataaye ki wo kya aisa karne ja rahi he jisase kisaanon kii aatmahatya ruk sake
 According to media reports, Tamil Nadu is in severe drought
 ham uttar bharatiyon ke liye to abhi garmi bhi nahin ai he magar dakshin ke hamaare priy rajya main sookhaa he
 The state government sought 39,565 crore help to deal with the drought
 ise aap package samajhate hai
 a drought has been declared in Tamil Nadu
 is saal northeast main barish 62 pratishat kam hui he
 This is the first time since 1876 there has been so little rain
 100 saal main pehali baar aisa sankat aayaa he phir bhi is sookhe kii daastaan aap tak laane ke liye kisi ko jantar mantar par nange badan khadey hona padataa he
 The water of Mettur Dam has reduced very much, the farmer can neither look towards the land nor look at the sky
 jantar mantar par jo kisaan aae hai unke paas bahut khet nahin hai
 All are small farmers
 inaki kuch maangen hai
 These farmers are going on hunger strike for 100 days
 inke paas hindi main ek parchaa he jis par sabase upar likhaa he, 'kisaan, jo raashtra ko ann dete hai, unki aatmahatya ko rokna
 Stop Tamil Nadu from becoming a desert
 kaveri nadi ko sookhne se rokna
 Constitution of Management Committee for Cauvery River
 krishi utpaadon ke liye uchit laabhadaayak mulya kaa nirdhaaran

 The name of the organization is South Indian Nadia Farmers Association
 hamaare liye to yah naam bhi nayaa he
 Nadia Farmers Association
 ye log nadiyon ko jodne kii maang karte hai
 In the morning Jantar Mantar came to show any support for these agitators
 unhone hamaare liye hindi main inaki samasya ko saamne rakhaa he
 Looking at the issue of farmers for so many days, one thing has been understood
 bharat ke kisaan laachaar nahin hai
 Farmers of India know how to make political decisions
 ve apane sankaton ke hisaab se raajnneetik faisla nahin karte hai balki puure samaaj ke liye faisla karte hai
 Otherwise farmers in many states do not vote for any political party
 jantar mantar par hi apane saamaan ke saath tamilnadu ke ye kisaan date hue hai
 Jantar Mantar is the real capital
 bharat kii samasyaon kaa ekmaatr pratinidhi sthal
 The Jantar Mantar that governments have imposed on the people, can only be the site of liberation from Jantar Mantar
 bharat main loktantr zindaa he jab tak jantar mantar zindaa he
 That is why this farmer lies on the bare open road
 kisaanon ko bhi neend aati he
 For three to four days, such rum has been lost as if it was Jantar Mantar
 ye jagah hi inke liye khet he
 Farmers suicide, drought crisis cover us all
 aisi koi baat nahin jiske bare main sarkaar ko na maaloom ho, patrkaar ne na likhaa ho
 The farmers are not getting the price
 kabhi kabhi muaavze mil jate hai
 Sometimes the loan gets forgiven
 lekin sankat or sookhaa har saal yaa har duusare saal laut aata he
 In Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu got the disease if the drought eradicated from the rains
 jab bhi koi suicide karata he, use pichhali suicide ke saath jod diya jaataa he
 106 farmers committed suicide
 yah kisaan 107waan tha
 Therefore, the suffering of the farmers is now beyond language
 jin logon ko bhashaa par bahut bharosa hota he unhen shuukravaar ke indian express ke pehle panne par chhapi bashaarat masood kii report padhani chahie
 The language of Kupwara of Kupwara in Kashmir was not even given a chance
 'maa kii bahon main so rahi thi
 His brother was sleeping next door
 ek goli ai jo kaniza ko khamosh kar gai
 The mother felt something sticky when she extended her hand towards the daughter
 gaur se dekha to bistar par koon failaa hua tha
 Kaniza had left this world
 baahar goli chal rahi thi
 Terrorists were hiding near Kaniza's house which was surrounded by security forces
 goli kiski bandook se chali pataa nahin chalaa
 But Kaniza, who was sleeping in another house, was killed
 uskaa bhai faisal bhi vahiin so rahaa tha
 got injured
 police waalon ne madad kii or astpal le jaaya gaya
 Faizal's life is saved but due to being in the hospital, Kaniza could not even see for the last time
 kashmir kii samasya bhi kisaanon kii samasya kii tarah he
 Everyone knows the crisis
 samaadhaan kisi ko nahin
 Now their problems have been overcome by language
 hamaari samvedanheenata kii koi bhashaa nahin he
 We have become like a bullet who silently kills a twelve-year-old girl and bounces her bed

 Ask that language what Kaniza, who was sleeping, said when she was shot
 vahiin to uski maa so rahi thi
 His brother was sleeping there
 tippaniyan 'I loved Kaniza very much
 mere chaar bete hai
 i was the only daughter
 mere daahine haath par sar rakhkar so rahi thi

 maine uske badan par apana haath rakhaa to chipchipa sa laga
 When i saw my hands, i was red with blood

 The blood was flowing from her and Faizal's body
 ' ye kaniza kii maa kaa bayaan he jinhone indian express ke bashaarat masood ko isi tarah bataaya he ki kaise uski iklauti or behad pyaari beti kaniza maar di gai
 Nazir Masudi of NDTV also reached Kaniza's house

 It is a dark room

 Where the sister has gone suddenly is out of their comprehension
 13 saal ke asalam or 10 saal ke zafar kii ankhon main sab he magar unki bahan nahin he
 The house was far away but the bullets cover the distance
 ek hafte ke bheetar yah duusari ghatana he
 In Pulwama too, a child died of an encounter bullet
 15 saal kaa tha, maaraa gaya
 On 5 March, four children were injured in an explosion near the security forces camp in Sopore

 There will be some Kashmir experts
 kuch sakht bayaan honge
 All these bullets find their way
 wo kisi aatankwaadi kaa peechha karte karte rasta badal leti he
 What did Kaniza know
 
 
 
 a bullet is coming up to his bed
 dilli ke jantar mantar par qatari baddh baithe logon ko dekhiye
 They do not have the language for the media of Delhi
 isliye unhone apane sharir ko hi bhashaa kaa rup de diya he
 His body, his clothes are speaking
 ham sabane isi jantar mantar par dilli ke aas paas ke kisaanon kaa hujum dekha he, magar tamilnadu ke kisaanon ko shaayad nahin dekha he
 They do not know Hindi
 kuch kuch angrezi bol rahe hai magar wo bhi mushkil se
 So they have taken off their clothes
 mahilaayein sirf hare rang ke peticot main hai
 Men in green lungi
 hamane ye sawaal poocha ki haraa rang kyon
 The answer was green because it is the color of the farmers
 dharti kaa rang he
 The politics of North India is taking the idea of kesariya as Hindu and Hare as Muslim, but the farmers of the south are describing Hare as the color of the farmer
 ye kisaan dharm se baahar nahin he
 Tripund is made on everyone's body
 shiv ke bhakt malmu padate hai
 Some farmers have taken a bowl in hand
 angrezi main likhaa he begar yani bhikhaari
 It is written in English so that Delhi can understand
 bhikhaari banakar wo apni baat angrezi main aap tak pahunchaana chaahate hai
 Their banners are also not in Tamil
 angrezi main hai
 Some farmers put garland of Narmund in the neck
 ye pratik he un kisaanon kaa jinhone karze or kheti ke sankat se tang aakar aatmahatya kar lee he

 a bullet is coming up to his bed
 100 kii sankhya main aae ye kisaan tamil main naare laga rahe hai
 Hardly its voice reached the farmers around Delhi
 bharat main kisaan kisaan ke liye nahin bolta he
 The city does not speak for the farmer
 naaron kii bhashaa badal bhi jaati to bhi inhen sunne vaale log nahin badalte
 Our colleague Munne Bharti tried hard to talk to someone
 na munne angrezi bol sakate the na wo hindi
 There was a middle language left on both sides, English which we sometimes tease in the name of fake linguistic self-respect
 kisne sochaa tha ki karz se laden kisaanon ko, aatmahatya karne waalon kisaanon ko angrezi kaa sahaara lenaa padegaa
 Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil have all left the farmers
 dilli kii angrezi kii apni alag dehshat he
 The English town of Delhi scares the English
 munne bharti ne ek kisaan se baat kii
 Do not listen to what they are saying
 kis tarah se bol rahe hai, unke bolne main jo tuutan he, use dekhiye
 If you find this topic heavy, then see something else
 dilli main kaaphi sankhya main taminladu ke log rahete hai
 Sometimes came as an officer and started living in RK Puram in South Delhi
 vahaan se ritair hue to mayur vihaar kii taraf jaakar bas gaye
 Many more are inhabited
 in logon ne bataaya ki tamilnadu ke log aakar khaane pine kaa intazaam kar de rahe hai
 Are showing support ye bhi acha he ki das paanch hi sahi, is shahar ke log inke bich ja rahe hai
 This is our quality jaisaa ki maine kaha ki tivi main dakshin bharat unheen maukon par hota he jab tamaasha hota he
 Otherwise, where in the Hindi world are we concerned about Tamil Nadu, that in the last four months, four hundred farmers have committed suicide
 dilli main baithne vaale manvidhakaar ayog ne 5 janvari ko rajya sarkaar ko vahaan kii press report ke aadhaar par notice bheja he
 The Tamil daily reported on 3 January 2017 that 83 farmers had died due to heart attack
 usee akhbaar ne 5 janvari 2017 ko bataaya he ki ek maheene main kisaanon kii maut kaa aankada 106 par pahunch gaya he
 The Commission wrote that policy makers are ignoring farmers
 kisaanon ko kheti ke sankat se nikaalane kii zarurat he
 At the same time, the Madras High Court had also asked the Tamil Nadu government to file an affidavit within four weeks that the government should tell what it was going to do to stop the farmers' suicide
 media report ke anusaar tamilnadu main bhayankar sookhaa he
 We are not even hot for North Indians, but there is a drought in our beloved state of South
 rajya sarkaar ne sookhaa se nipatane ke liye 39,565 karod kii madad maangi
 You consider it a package
 tamilnadu main sookhaa ghoshit kar diya gaya he
 The rainfall in the Northeast has come down by 62 percent this year
 1876 ke baad pehali baar itani kam barish hui he
 For the first time in 100 years, such a crisis has come, yet one has to stand bare body at Jantar Mantar to bring the story of this drought to you
 mettoor baandh kaa pani bahut kam ho gaya he, kisaan na zamin kii taraf dekh saktaa he na aasmaan kii taraf taak saktaa he
 The farmers who have come to Jantar Mantar do not have much fields
 chote kisaan hi hai saare
 They have some demands
 ye kisaan 100 dinon ke liye bhukh hadtaal kar rahe hai
 They have a pamphlet in Hindi on which it is written at the top, 'farmers, who give food to the nation, to stop their suicide
 tamilnadu ko registan banane se rokna
 To prevent the Cauvery River from drying up
 kaveri nadi ke liye prabandhan samiti kaa gathan
 Determination of fair profitable prices for agricultural products
 ' It is also written in the pamphlet, hunger strike with sorrow
 sanghathan kaa naam he dakshin bhartiya nadiya kisaan sangh
 This name is also new to us
 nadiya kisaan sangh
 These people demand to connect the rivers
 subah jantar mantar par in andolankariyon ke liye koi samarthan jataane aayaa tha
 They have put their problem in front of us in Hindi
 itane dinon se kisaanon ke masale ko dekhte hue ek baat samaj ai he
 The farmers of India are not helpless
 bharat ke kisaan raajnneetik faisla karnaa jaanate hai
 They do not make political decisions according to their crises, but for the whole society
 varna kai rajyon main kisaan kisi raajnneetik dal ke liye vot hi nahin karte
 These farmers of Tamil Nadu are stuck with their belongings at Jantar Mantar itself
 jantar mantar hi asli rajdhani he
 The only representative site of India's problems
 sarkaron ne janata par jo jantar mantar kiya he, usase mukti kaa sthal jantar mantar hi ho saktaa he
 Democracy in India is alive as long as Jantar Mantar is alive
 tabhi to ye kisaan nange badan khuli sadak par let gaya he
 Farmers also get sleep
 teen chaar dinon se aise ram gaye hai jaise jantar mantar hi inkaa ghar ho
 This place is the farm for them
 kisaanon kii aatmahatya, sookhe kaa sankat ham sab cover karte hai
 There is nothing that the government does not know about, the journalist has not written
 kisaanon ko daam nahin mil rahe hai
 Sometimes compensation is received
 kabhi kabhaar karza maaf ho jaataa he
 But the crisis and drought returns every year or every other year
 maharashtra main barish se sookhe ne mukti pai to tamilnadu ko yah rog lag gaya
 Whenever someone commits suicide, it is added to the previous suicide
 106 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii
 This farmer was 107th
 isliye kisaanon kii takaleef ab bhashaa ke paar he
 Those who have great faith in the language should read Basharat Masood's report printed on the front page of Friday's Indian Express
 kashmir ke kupwada kii kaniza ko to bhashaa ne uf karne tak kaa mauka nahin diya
 'sleeping in mother's arms
 bagal main uskaa bhai so rahaa tha
 a bullet arrived which silenced Kaniza
 maa ne jab apana haath beti kii taraf badhaayaa to kuch chipchipa sa mahasoos hua
 If i looked closely, the blood was spread on the bed
 kaniza is duniya se ja chuki thi
 Bullet was going on outside
 kaniza ke ghar ke paas main aatankwaadi chhipe the jinhen suraksha balon ne gher liya tha
 Whose gun shot was not known
 magar ek duusare ghar main so rahi kaniza ko maar gai
 His brother Faizal was also sleeping there
 ghayal ho gaya
 The policemen helped and Astpal was taken
 faisal kii jaan batch gai he magar aspataal main hone ke kaaran kaniza ko aakiri baar ke liye bhi nahin dekh paaya
 The problem of Kashmir is also like the problem of farmers
 sabko sankat maaloom he
 The solution is none
 ab unki takalif bhashaa ke paar ho chuki he
 There is no language of our insensitivity
 ham us goli kii tarah ho gaye hai jo ek baarah saal kii bacchee ko chupchaap maar kar, uske bistar ko lahooluhaan kar gaayab ho jate hai
 If there is any language for the suffering of Kaniza's mother, then tell it
 us bhashaa se puuchhiye ki neend main so rahi kaniza ne tab kya kaha tha, jab goli lagi thi
 His mother was sleeping there
 vahiin to uskaa bhai so rahaa tha
 The comments 'bahut pyaar karti thi kaniza ko
 i have four sons meri iklauti beti thi
 Sleeping with my head on my right hand
 achaakan usne jatke se saans lee
 When i put my hand on his body, it felt a bit sticky
 jab maine apni haathon ko dekha to koon se laal ho gaye the
 When i threw the blanket, i saw that there was blood all around
 uske or faijal ke badan se koon bah rahaa tha
 This is the statement of Kaniza's mother who told Basharat Masood of the Indian Express how his only and very dear daughter Kaniza was killed
 enditivi ke nazir masudi bhi kaniza ke ghar pahunche
 How difficult it would be for a reporter to communicate with people in such times
 andhera sa cameraa he
 Kaniza's brother is Kafzada
 bahan achaanak kahaan chali gai he ye unki samaj se baahar he
 13-year-old Aslam and 10-year-old Zafar all have eyes but their sister is not
 ghar dur tha magar goliyaan duuri tay kar leti hai
 This is the second incident within a week
 pulavama main bhi encounter kii goliyon kaa shikaar ek baccha ho gaya
 Was 15 years old, killed
 5 march ko sopor main suraksha balon ke camp ke nazadik visphot hone se chaar bachche ghayal ho gaye
 Everyone will have arguments
 kuch kashmir ke export honge
 There will be some hard statements
 in sabase goli apana rasta khoj leti he
 She changes the path chasing a terrorist
 kaniza ko kya pataa tha
 
 
 
 ek goli uske bistar tak aa rahi he
 a large number of people of Tamil Nadu live in Delhi
 kabhi afasar banakar aae or dakshin dilli ke aarake puram main rahane lage
 After retiring from there, he settled towards Mayur Vihar
 or bhi kai jagahon par based hue hai
 These people told that the people of Tamil Nadu are coming and arranging for food
 samarthan jataa rahe hai
 It is also good that the people of this city are going among them, only ten to five
 yahi to hamaari khubi he
 As i said in TV, South India happens on the same occasions when there is a spectacle
 varna ham hindi kii duniya main kahaan tamilnadu ko lekar chintit hote hai ki vahaan pichley chaar maheene main chaar sau kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 The Human Rights Commission, which sits in Delhi, has sent a notice to the state government on 5 January based on the press report there
 tamil dainik ne 3 janvari 2017 ko khabar chhaapi he ki dil kaa daura padane se 83 kisaanon kii maut hui he
 The same newspaper has reported on 5 January 2017 that the death toll of farmers has reached 106 in a month
 ayog ne likhaa tha ki niti banane vaale kisaanon ko nazarandaaz kar rahe hai
 Farmers need to be removed from the farming crisis
 usee vakt madras hoicourt ne bhi chaar hafton ke bheetar tamilnadu sarkaar ko halafanama daayar karne ke liye kaha tha ki sarkaar bataaye ki wo kya aisa karne ja rahi he jisase kisaanon kii aatmahatya ruk sake
 According to media reports, Tamil Nadu is in severe drought
 ham uttar bharatiyon ke liye to abhi garmi bhi nahin ai he magar dakshin ke hamaare priy rajya main sookhaa he
 The state government sought 39,565 crore help to deal with the drought
 ise aap package samajhate hai
 a drought has been declared in Tamil Nadu
 is saal northeast main barish 62 pratishat kam hui he
 This is the first time since 1876 there has been so little rain
 100 saal main pehali baar aisa sankat aayaa he phir bhi is sookhe kii daastaan aap tak laane ke liye kisi ko jantar mantar par nange badan khadey hona padataa he
 The water of Mettur Dam has reduced very much, the farmer can neither look towards the land nor look at the sky
 jantar mantar par jo kisaan aae hai unke paas bahut khet nahin hai
 All are small farmers
 inaki kuch maangen hai
 These farmers are going on hunger strike for 100 days
 inke paas hindi main ek parchaa he jis par sabase upar likhaa he, 'kisaan, jo raashtra ko ann dete hai, unki aatmahatya ko rokna
 Stop Tamil Nadu from becoming a desert
 kaveri nadi ko sookhne se rokna

 In the morning Jantar Mantar came to show any support for these agitators
 unhone hamaare liye hindi main inaki samasya ko saamne rakhaa he
 Looking at the issue of farmers for so many days, one thing has been understood
 bharat ke kisaan laachaar nahin hai
 Farmers of India know how to make political decisions
 ve apane sankaton ke hisaab se raajnneetik faisla nahin karte hai balki puure samaaj ke liye faisla karte hai
 Otherwise farmers in many states do not vote for any political party
 jantar mantar par hi apane saamaan ke saath tamilnadu ke ye kisaan date hue hai
 Jantar Mantar is the real capital
 bharat kii samasyaon kaa ekmaatr pratinidhi sthal
 The Jantar Mantar that governments have imposed on the people, can only be the site of liberation from Jantar Mantar
 bharat main loktantr zindaa he jab tak jantar mantar zindaa he
 That is why this farmer lies on the bare open road
 kisaanon ko bhi neend aati he
 For three to four days, such rum has been lost as if it was Jantar Mantar
 ye jagah hi inke liye khet he
 Farmers suicide, drought crisis cover us all
 aisi koi baat nahin jiske bare main sarkaar ko na maaloom ho, patrkaar ne na likhaa ho
 The farmers are not getting the price
 kabhi kabhi muaavze mil jate hai
 Sometimes the loan gets forgiven
 lekin sankat or sookhaa har saal yaa har duusare saal laut aata he
 In Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu got the disease if the drought eradicated from the rains
 jab bhi koi suicide karata he, use pichhali suicide ke saath jod diya jaataa he
 106 farmers committed suicide
 yah kisaan 107waan tha
 Therefore, the suffering of the farmers is now beyond language
 jin logon ko bhashaa par bahut bharosa hota he unhen shuukravaar ke indian express ke pehle panne par chhapi bashaarat masood kii report padhani chahie
 The language of Kupwara of Kupwara in Kashmir was not even given a chance

 media report ke anusaar tamilnadu main bhayankar sookhaa he
 We are not even hot for North Indians, but there is a drought in our beloved state of South
 rajya sarkaar ne sookhaa se nipatane ke liye 39,565 karod kii madad maangi
 You consider it a package
 tamilnadu main sookhaa ghoshit kar diya gaya he
 The rainfall in the Northeast has come down by 62 percent this year
 1876 ke baad pehali baar itani kam barish hui he
 For the first time in 100 years, such a crisis has come, yet one has to stand bare body at Jantar Mantar to bring the story of this drought to you
 mettoor baandh kaa pani bahut kam ho gaya he, kisaan na zamin kii taraf dekh saktaa he na aasmaan kii taraf taak saktaa he
 The farmers who have come to Jantar Mantar do not have much fields
 chote kisaan hi hai saare
 They have some demands
 ye kisaan 100 dinon ke liye bhukh hadtaal kar rahe hai
 They have a pamphlet in Hindi on which it is written at the top, 'farmers, who give food to the nation, to stop their suicide
 tamilnadu ko registan banane se rokna
 To prevent the Cauvery River from drying up
 kaveri nadi ke liye prabandhan samiti kaa gathan
 Determination of fair profitable prices for agricultural products
 ' It is also written in the pamphlet, hunger strike with sorrow
 sanghathan kaa naam he dakshin bhartiya nadiya kisaan sangh
 This name is also new to us
 nadiya kisaan sangh
 These people demand to connect the rivers
 subah jantar mantar par in andolankariyon ke liye koi samarthan jataane aayaa tha
 They have put their problem in front of us in Hindi
 itane dinon se kisaanon ke masale ko dekhte hue ek baat samaj ai he
 The farmers of India are not helpless
 bharat ke kisaan raajnneetik faisla karnaa jaanate hai
 They do not make political decisions according to their crises, but for the whole society
 varna kai rajyon main kisaan kisi raajnneetik dal ke liye vot hi nahin karte
 These farmers of Tamil Nadu are stuck with their belongings at Jantar Mantar itself
 jantar mantar hi asli rajdhani he
 The only representative site of India's problems
 sarkaron ne janata par jo jantar mantar kiya he, usase mukti kaa sthal jantar mantar hi ho saktaa he
 Democracy in India is alive as long as Jantar Mantar is alive
 tabhi to ye kisaan nange badan khuli sadak par let gaya he
 Farmers also get sleep
 teen chaar dinon se aise ram gaye hai jaise jantar mantar hi inkaa ghar ho
 This place is the farm for them
 kisaanon kii aatmahatya, sookhe kaa sankat ham sab cover karte hai
 There is nothing that the government does not know about, the journalist has not written
 kisaanon ko daam nahin mil rahe hai
 Sometimes compensation is received
 kabhi kabhaar karza maaf ho jaataa he
 But the crisis and drought returns every year or every other year
 maharashtra main barish se sookhe ne mukti pai to tamilnadu ko yah rog lag gaya
 Whenever someone commits suicide, it is added to the previous suicide
 106 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii
 This farmer was 107th
 isliye kisaanon kii takaleef ab bhashaa ke paar he
 Those who have great faith in the language should read Basharat Masood's report printed on the front page of Friday's Indian Express
 kashmir ke kupwada kii kaniza ko to bhashaa ne uf karne tak kaa mauka nahin diya
 'sleeping in mother's arms
 bagal main uskaa bhai so rahaa tha
 a bullet arrived which silenced Kaniza
 maa ne jab apana haath beti kii taraf badhaayaa to kuch chipchipa sa mahasoos hua
 If i looked closely, the blood was spread on the bed
 kaniza is duniya se ja chuki thi
 Bullet was going on outside
 kaniza ke ghar ke paas main aatankwaadi chhipe the jinhen suraksha balon ne gher liya tha
 Whose gun shot was not known
 magar ek duusare ghar main so rahi kaniza ko maar gai
 His brother Faizal was also sleeping there
 ghayal ho gaya
 The policemen helped and Astpal was taken
 faisal kii jaan batch gai he magar aspataal main hone ke kaaran kaniza ko aakiri baar ke liye bhi nahin dekh paaya
 The problem of Kashmir is also like the problem of farmers
 sabko sankat maaloom he
 The solution is none
 ab unki takalif bhashaa ke paar ho chuki he
 There is no language of our insensitivity
 ham us goli kii tarah ho gaye hai jo ek baarah saal kii bacchee ko chupchaap maar kar, uske bistar ko lahooluhaan kar gaayab ho jate hai
 If there is any language for the suffering of Kaniza's mother, then tell it
 us bhashaa se puuchhiye ki neend main so rahi kaniza ne tab kya kaha tha, jab goli lagi thi
 His mother was sleeping there
 vahiin to uskaa bhai so rahaa tha

 This is the statement of Kaniza's mother who told Basharat Masood of the Indian Express how his only and very dear daughter Kaniza was killed
 enditivi ke nazir masudi bhi kaniza ke ghar pahunche
 How difficult it would be for a reporter to communicate with people in such times
 andhera sa cameraa he
 Kaniza's brother is Kafzada
 bahan achaanak kahaan chali gai he ye unki samaj se baahar he
 13-year-old Aslam and 10-year-old Zafar all have eyes but their sister is not
 ghar dur tha magar goliyaan duuri tay kar leti hai

 jab maine apni haathon ko dekha to koon se laal ho gaye the
 When i threw the blanket, i saw that there was blood all around
 uske or faijal ke badan se koon bah rahaa tha
 This is the statement of Kaniza's mother who told Basharat Masood of the Indian Express how his only and very dear daughter Kaniza was killed
 enditivi ke nazir masudi bhi kaniza ke ghar pahunche
 How difficult it would be for a reporter to communicate with people in such times
 andhera sa cameraa he
 Kaniza's brother is Kafzada
 bahan achaanak kahaan chali gai he ye unki samaj se baahar he
 13-year-old Aslam and 10-year-old Zafar all have eyes but their sister is not
 ghar dur tha magar goliyaan duuri tay kar leti hai
 This is the second incident within a week
 pulavama main bhi encounter kii goliyon kaa shikaar ek baccha ho gaya
 Was 15 years old, killed
 5 march ko sopor main suraksha balon ke camp ke nazadik visphot hone se chaar bachche ghayal ho gaye
 Everyone will have arguments
 kuch kashmir ke export honge
 There will be some hard statements
 in sabase goli apana rasta khoj leti he
 She changes the path chasing a terrorist
 kaniza ko kya pataa tha
 
 
 
 ek goli uske bistar tak aa rahi he
 Looking at the issue of farmers for so many days, one thing has been understood
 bharat ke kisaan laachaar nahin hai
 Farmers of India know how to make political decisions
 ve apane sankaton ke hisaab se raajnneetik faisla nahin karte hai balki puure samaaj ke liye faisla karte hai
 Otherwise farmers in many states do not vote for any political party
 jantar mantar par hi apane saamaan ke saath tamilnadu ke ye kisaan date hue hai
 Jantar Mantar is the real capital
 bharat kii samasyaon kaa ekmaatr pratinidhi sthal
 The Jantar Mantar that governments have imposed on the people, can only be the site of liberation from Jantar Mantar
 bharat main loktantr zindaa he jab tak jantar mantar zindaa he
 That is why this farmer lies on the bare open road
 kisaanon ko bhi neend aati he
 For three to four days, such rum has been lost as if it was Jantar Mantar
 ye jagah hi inke liye khet he
 Farmers suicide, drought crisis cover us all
 aisi koi baat nahin jiske bare main sarkaar ko na maaloom ho, patrkaar ne na likhaa ho
 The farmers are not getting the price
 kabhi kabhi muaavze mil jate hai
 Sometimes the loan gets forgiven
 lekin sankat or sookhaa har saal yaa har duusare saal laut aata he
 In Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu got the disease if the drought eradicated from the rains
 jab bhi koi suicide karata he, use pichhali suicide ke saath jod diya jaataa he
 106 farmers committed suicide
 yah kisaan 107waan tha
 Therefore, the suffering of the farmers is now beyond language
 jin logon ko bhashaa par bahut bharosa hota he unhen shuukravaar ke indian express ke pehle panne par chhapi bashaarat masood kii report padhani chahie
 The language of Kupwara of Kupwara in Kashmir was not even given a chance
 'maa kii bahon main so rahi thi
 His brother was sleeping next door
 ek goli ai jo kaniza ko khamosh kar gai
 The mother felt something sticky when she extended her hand towards the daughter
 gaur se dekha to bistar par koon failaa hua tha
 Kaniza had left this world
 baahar goli chal rahi thi
 Terrorists were hiding near Kaniza's house which was surrounded by security forces
 goli kiski bandook se chali pataa nahin chalaa
 But Kaniza, who was sleeping in another house, was killed
 uskaa bhai faisal bhi vahiin so rahaa tha
 got injured
 police waalon ne madad kii or astpal le jaaya gaya
 Faizal's life is saved but due to being in the hospital, Kaniza could not even see for the last time
 kashmir kii samasya bhi kisaanon kii samasya kii tarah he
 Everyone knows the crisis
 samaadhaan kisi ko nahin
 Now their problems have been overcome by language
 hamaari samvedanheenata kii koi bhashaa nahin he
 We have become like a bullet who silently kills a twelve-year-old girl and bounces her bed
 agar kaniza kii maa kii takalif ke liye koi bhashaa he to bataaiye
 Ask that language what Kaniza, who was sleeping, said when she was shot
 vahiin to uski maa so rahi thi
 His brother was sleeping there
 tippaniyan 'I loved Kaniza very much
 mere chaar bete hai
 i was the only daughter
 mere daahine haath par sar rakhkar so rahi thi
 Achaakan he breathed in shock
 maine uske badan par apana haath rakhaa to chipchipa sa laga
 When i saw my hands, i was red with blood
 maine kambal phenkaa to dekha ki chaaron taraf koon failaa hua tha
 The blood was flowing from her and Faizal's body
 ' ye kaniza kii maa kaa bayaan he jinhone indian express ke bashaarat masood ko isi tarah bataaya he ki kaise uski iklauti or behad pyaari beti kaniza maar di gai
 Nazir Masudi of NDTV also reached Kaniza's house
 ek reporter ke liye kitna mushkil hota hoga aise vakt main logon se samvaad bananaa
 It is a dark room
 kaniza ke bhai khofazada hai
 Where the sister has gone suddenly is out of their comprehension
 13 saal ke asalam or 10 saal ke zafar kii ankhon main sab he magar unki bahan nahin he
 The house was far away but the bullets cover the distance
 ek hafte ke bheetar yah duusari ghatana he
 In Pulwama too, a child died of an encounter bullet
 15 saal kaa tha, maaraa gaya
 On 5 March, four children were injured in an explosion near the security forces camp in Sopore
 sabake paas daleelein hongi
 There will be some Kashmir experts
 kuch sakht bayaan honge
 All these bullets find their way
 wo kisi aatankwaadi kaa peechha karte karte rasta badal leti he

 kisaanon kii aatmahatya, sookhe kaa sankat ham sab cover karte hai
 There is nothing that the government does not know about, the journalist has not written
 kisaanon ko daam nahin mil rahe hai
 Sometimes compensation is received
 kabhi kabhaar karza maaf ho jaataa he
 But the crisis and drought returns every year or every other year
 maharashtra main barish se sookhe ne mukti pai to tamilnadu ko yah rog lag gaya
 Whenever someone commits suicide, it is added to the previous suicide
 106 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii
 This farmer was 107th

 Those who have great faith in the language should read Basharat Masood's report printed on the front page of Friday's Indian Express

 maa ne jab apana haath beti kii taraf badhaayaa to kuch chipchipa sa mahasoos hua
 If i looked closely, the blood was spread on the bed

 Bullet was going on outside

 It is also an important fact that the foundation of the plant in which the accident took place was laid by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi

 When Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was fighting for the freedom struggle, under his leadership, the land of Rae Bareli became witness to the peasant movement

 After his death, Rae Bareli was led by Indira Gandhi

 After a loud explosion there was a terrible fire and smoke spread all around
 dhamaakaa itnaa bhayanak tha ki tamaam log uchhalkar dur power plant ke pipon se ja takaraae yaa unamem funs gaye
 The news of the accident shocked the Gandhi family
 sonia gandhi apane sansadeey kshetra kii ghatana main peediton se milane janaa chaahati thim, lekin swasthya thik na hone se wo nahin ja sakin
 Sonia said in a condolence message that she herself wanted to come, but due to being unwell, i am not able to reach you
 lekin is dukh kii ghadi main aapke saath hum
 Questions are arising out of Rahul's readiness, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is soon to become Congress President
 unhone apni maa ke sansadeey kshetra main hue haadase par dukh jaahir kiya
 Rahul Gandhi arrived yesterday on a three-day tour of Gujarat
 lekin guuruuvaar ko unhone apane daure ko bich main rokkar sidhe raibareli kaa rukh kiya
 Rahul met the victims and their families in the accident
 rahul ke kisi haadase ke baad peediton se milane jane kaa ye pehla mauka nahin he lekin ve jis tarah gujarat kaa daura bich main hi chhodkar ghatana se 24 ghante hone se pehle hi raibareli pahunch gaye usase unki raajnneeti par najar rakhane vaale log hairaan hai
 The special thing is that Rahul had to come back from Rae Bareli to Gujarat because he had many important programs in view of the elections there
 rahul ke is tarah tatparta dikhaate hue raibareli ke oonchaahar pahunchane se ye bhi kayaas lagaae jane lage hai ki bhavishya ke loksabhaa chunaav main wo amethi ke bajaay raibareli se chunaav lard sakate hai
 Sonia Gandhi is ill by the way
 use dekhakar mana ja rahaa he ki wo aglaa chunaav nahin ladengi
 In such a situation, Rahul can get on Rae Bareli seat because Smriti Irani's entry in Amethi has weakened her grip and the margin of victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections was very less

 In the name of second development, he starts building e governance and call center, but no new thinking about development seems to hit the ground
 vikaas kaa vikalp koun sa vikaas he ye koi nahin bataata balki uski jagah kaarykushalta or mobile phone ke eps ko nayaa vikaas bataa detaa he
 Therefore our understanding of all political debates is not clear that if this is not development then what is other development
 hamaari kheti ek gambhir sankat se guzar rahi he
 Has been going through many years
 centre se lekar rajya sarkaar tak koi apane kaam kaa hisaab nahin detaa ki hamane ye kiya or kheti ko sankat se ubaar liya
 They say Congress and Congress says BJP
 koi saath saal kii duhai detaa he to koi pandrah saal kisi rajya main sarkaar chalaakar bhi nahin bataa paa rahaa he ki hamane iskaa samaadhaan kiya he
 So even this debate gives us no special understanding except that people are happy to see the parties of their choice winning the debate
 sansad main netaaon ke bhaashan kii sanjidagi kaa imtahaan lenaa ho to aap kisi mandi main chale jaaiye
 i cannot say the mandis of other states but have seen the mandis of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana
 maharashtra kii mandi dekhi he kaaphi hitech kism kii lekin vahaan bhi to kisaan aatmahatya kar rahaa he
 Yet if there is so much pressure on the Prime Minister about the farmers that they are speaking in Parliament in a sad tone, then why is there no such pressure on the ministers, officers and employees of the states
 ab main aadhati, bank, mandi or kisaan system kaa network samajhaata hum
 i do not claim that my understanding is complete but i want to keep it as raw as you have understood
 rajya sarkarein apane nigamon ke zariye mandiyon se anaaj kharidti hai
 There is an intermediary between the farmer and these corporations that we call agents and agents
 ye aadhati pidiyon se chale aa rahe hai or zyaadaatar ek hi jatigat samaaj se sambandh rakhte hai
 The farmer brings wheat from the field and keeps it in the market
 uske baad ek karmchaaree aata he to gehun kii nami kii maatra tay karata he or parchez inspector ko kareedne kii anumati de detaa he
 From weighing the wheat of the farmer to filling it into sacks and loading it in trucks, it is the job of transporting it to the godowns of corporations
 iske liye aadhati ko har pachaas kilo gehun kii bori par chah rupee kii mazaduri deni padati he
 In return, the buying agency pays a commission of 2
5 percent to the agent
 agar 1450 rupee prati quintal gehun kaa kareed mulya he to usamen aadhati ko 35-36 rupee milte hai
 Now i could not understand that it gets two and a half percent separately to the adhati or he deducts the labor and commission money from the 1450 in the wheat sack
 aadhati trakon se agenciyon ke paas pahunchaa detaa he
 The buying agencies check the quality of the wheat and deduct a portion of the Rs 1450 if found to be deficient
 iske liye nami kii maatra se lekar toote hue daanon kii maatra kaa pratishat tay hota he
 It is so complicated that you will pass in Algebra but not in the faction
 aadhati kahata he ki agar usne kisaanon ko 1450 rupee de diye or kharid agency ne quality ke aadhaar par kam bhugtan kiya to uskaa nuksaan ho jayega
 However, the farmer will never know that on what basis and in what quantity his wheat quality is weakened and money is cut
 ab yah aadhati kii eemaandaaree par hi nirbhar karata he
 Hence, the agent in the mandi does not give a firm slip to the farmers
 jabaki aadhati ko pakki parchi deni chahie jise je form kehete hai
 In this receipt, the total price and rate of wheat is written with the name of the village and the farmer
 pakki parchi dene kaa matlab puraa paisa dena hoga
 Giving raw pulp means that the agent will cut the money of the farmer later that the price of your wheat has got only 1300 rupees
 kanuunan use kachi parchi nahin deni chahie
 Then when the government has said that all wheat will be purchased
 media main aisi khabaren aati hai magar zamin par sab nahin karidaa jaataa
 All the layers of rules are fixed for which wheat will be purchased
 ek nazar main ham is aadhati ko hataa den to bahut si samasya khatm ho jaaegi
 When the mandi is there, the farmer has to come and sell the grain and there is a government agency to buy, so why are these agents on permanent and caste basis
 iskaa doosraa paksh or bhi he
 If the exploitation can be the reason for exploitation, then it is also the partner of farmers in trouble
 kisaan kehete hai ki bank vaale karz dene ke liye zamin girvee par rakhwa lete hai
 a lot of time is left in paperwork while the agent gives loan on the basis of faith
 jab kisaan ke paas atirikt paisa hota he to wo aadhati ke yahaan hi nivesh karata he kyonki aadhati bank se zyaada byaaz detaa he
 The farmer may be angry with the agent but will not revolt against him because he is trapped in a cycle
 kisaanon ne kaha ki ve bank se zyada aadhati se karza lete hai
 The bank gives loans for agriculture, not personal loans, instead of land
 aadhati personal lone bhi detaa he
 The money is easily available from the agent, but the rules of recovery are very strict
 byaaz dar bainkon se bahut zyaada he
 Not only this, a farmer said that if a loan of two lakh rupees is taken, then it will have to be repaid simultaneously
 aadha chukaayenge to aadhati karz kii puri raashi par alag se dhai pratishat or byaaz le legaa
 In this way Sood becomes more than the original
 jab desh ke netaa kehete hai ki sahukaaron se kisaanon ko mukt karaayenge to puraa sach nahin bolte
 They know who the moneylender is
 aadhati hi wo sahuukaar hai jiske kai sadsy inhen partiyon main bade bade netaa hote hai
 Therefore, if the method is finished then the farmer will end, but if the method continues, the farmer will end
 aap is pankti ko dhyaan se padhate rahiye or yah samajhiye ki jab ham ek makaan ke liye lone lete hai to selary ke aadhaar par pachaas lakh ke makaan ke liye pantis lakh tak kaa lone mil jaataa he
 Our job is also not confirmed
 kabhi bhi ja sakati he
 But if the farmer goes for a loan, first he will pledge one crore of his land with the banks and then he will get a loan of 2
5 lakh
 ek kisaan ne aaj mujhe yahi bataaya
 The loan that i will get from the bank will be available for ten or twenty years, the farmer gets a loan for at least six months
 mandi main anaaj girte hi or bhugtan kaa check milte hi kisaanon ko phone aane lagata he ki pehle lone chukaayiye
 The comments ab is sthiti main hamaare bank bhi kisaanon ke saath sahukaaron se kam atyaachaar nahin karte hai
 Even then the Kisan Credit Card has given him many facilities but the farmer is stuck in a cycle from which he cannot get out
 mausam karaab nahin hone par bhi wo nahin nikal paata he
 The difference is that one hopes that good days have come
 darasal kisaanon ke achche din aate hi nahin he
 It is better to turn off the TV and go to the mandis
 vahaan pataa chalegaa ki kaise kisaan bhagwaan bharose chhod diya gaya he
 Look at their seating arrangement in the mandis
 aapako shame aegi
 There is no watchman to guard the nights
 police nahin hoti
 The farmer awakens throughout the night and guards his grain
 yah sab tab he jab tivi channelon ko dekhakar aisa lagata he ki hamaare netaa kisaanon ke liye kitna kaam kar rahe honge
 Nobody tells what development option is, but instead it tells efficiency and mobile phone apps new development
 isliye tamaam raajnneetik bahason se hamaari aapaki samaj saaf nahin ho paati he ki ye vikaas nahin he to doosraa vikaas kya he
 Our farming is going through a serious crisis
 pichley kai saalon se guzar rahi he
 No one, from the Center to the state government, gives an account of their work that we have done this and got the agriculture out of the crisis
 wo kehete hai congress or congress kahati he bijepi
 If someone asks for sixty years, then even after running a government in a state for fifteen years, he is unable to tell that we have resolved it
 lihaaza is bahes se bhi hamen koi vishesh samaj nahin milti he sivaay iske ki log apni apni pasand kii partiyon ko bahes main jitate dekh khush ho lete hai
 If you want to test the seriousness of the speech of the leaders in Parliament, then you go to some market
 main anya rajyon kii mandiyon kii baat nahin kah saktaa lekin uttar pradesh or haryana kii mandiyaan dekhi hai
 Mandi in Maharashtra has seen a lot of high-tech type, but even there, the farmer is committing suicide
 phir bhi agar kisaanon ko lekar pradhanmantri par itnaa dabaav he ki ve udhaas swar main sansad main bol rahe hai to rajyon ke mantriyon, afasaron or karmchaariyon par vaisaa dabaav kyon nahin he
 Now i explain the network of Aadhati, Bank, Mandi and Kisan systems
 main daawa nahin karata ki meri samaj puri he par jitna kaccha pakkaa samajha he wo aapke saamne rakhana chahta hum
 State governments, through their corporations, buy food grains from mandis
 kisaan or in nigamon ke bich ek madhyasth hota he jise ham agent or aadhati kehete hai
 They have been going on for generations, and mostly belong to the same caste society
 kisaan khet se gehun lekar aata he or mandi main rakh detaa he
 After that an employee arrives, sets the moisture content of the wheat and allows the inspector to buy the purchase
 kisaan ke us gehun ko taulne se lekar bore main bharne or trek main ladakar nigamon ke godaamon tak pahunchane kaa kaam aadhati kaa he
 For this, the adhatti has to pay a wage of six rupees for every fifty kilos of wheat sack
 badale main kharidne vaali agency aadhati ko dhai pratishat kaa kamishan detii he
 If the purchase price of wheat is Rs 1450 per quintal, then the agent gets Rs 35-36
 ab main yah nahin samaj sakaa ki yah dhai pratishat alag se aadhati ko miltaa he yaa wo genhu ko bore main bharne kii mazaduri or kamishan kaa paisa 1450 main se hi kaat letaa he
 The agent delivers the trucks to agencies
 kareed agenciyaan gehun kii quality kii jaanch karti hai or kami paae jane par 1450 rupee main se kuch hissaa kaat leti hai
 For this, the percentage of moisture content is broken and the percentage of grains broken
 yah itnaa jatil hota he ki aap algebra main paas ho jaayenge magar aadhati ke yahaan nahin
 Aadhati says that if he gave 1450 rupees to the farmers and the procurement agency paid less on the basis of quality then it would be lost
 vaise kisaan ko kabhi pataa hi nahin chalegaa ki uske gehun kii quality ko kis aadhaar par or kis maatra main kamazor bataakar paisa kaata gaya he
 Now it depends only on the integrity of the agent
 isliye mandi main aadhati kisaanon ko pakki parchi nahin detaa
 Whereas the adhatti should give a firm slip, which is called j form
 is raseed main gaanv or kisaan ke naam ke saath gehun kii kul keemat or rate likhaa hota he
 Giving a firm slip will mean paying full money
 kachi pakki dene kaa matlab he ki aadhati baad main kisaan kaa paisa kaat degaa ki aapke gehun kaa daam 1300 rupaya hi mila he
 The law should not give him a raw slip
 tab jab sarkaar ne kah diya he ki sab gehun kharida jayega
 Such news comes in the media but not everyone is bought on the ground
 koun sa gehun kharida jayega iske liye niyamon kii tamaam paraten tay hoti hai
 At a glance, if we remove this job, many problems will be eliminated
 jab mandi he, vahaan kisaan ko aakar anaaj bechnaa he or kharidne ke liye sarkari agency he to sthaayee or jatigat aadhaar par ye agent kyon hai
 There is another side to it
 aadhati shoshan kaa kaaran ho saktaa he to yahi musiibat main kisaanon kaa saathi bhi he
 Farmers say that the bankers get the land mortgaged for lending
 kaagazi karrwai main hi kaaphi vakt nikal jaataa he jabaki aadhati vishwaas ke aadhaar par karz de detaa he
 When the farmer has additional money, he invests with the agent only because the agent pays more interest than the bank
 kisaan aadhati se naaraaz ho saktaa he magar uske kilaaf khulaa vidroh nahin karegaa kyonki wo ek chakra main fansaa he
 The farmers said that they borrow more from the bank than the agent
 bank to zamin ke badale kheti ke liye lone detaa he, personal lone nahin detaa
 Arrati also gives personal loans
 aadhati se sirf paisa aasaani se miltaa he lekin vasuuli ke niyam behad sakht hai
 The rate of interest is much higher than banks
 itnaa hi nahin, ek kisaan ne bataaya ki agar do lakh rupee karj liya he to ek saath chukaana hoga
 If you pay half, then you will get another two and a half percent interest on the entire amount of the borrower loan
 is tarah se sood mul se zyada ho jaataa he
 When the country's leaders say that they will free the farmers from the moneylenders, they do not speak the whole truth
 unhen pataa hota he ki sahuukaar koun he
 They are the moneylender whose members are very big leaders in these parties
 isliye aadhati khatm hoga to kisaan or khatm hoga magar aadhati rahegaa to kisaan khatm hoga hi
 You should keep reading this line carefully and understand that when we take a loan for a house, on the basis of salary, you get a loan of up to thirty five lakh for a house of fifty lakhs
 hamaari naukari bhi pakki nahin he
 Can go anytime
 lekin kisaan karz lene jayega to pehle ek karod kii apni zamin bainkon ke paas girvee rakhega phir use dhai lakh kaa lone milegaa
 This is what a farmer told me today
 mujhe bank se jo lone milegaa wo das yaa bees saal ke liye milegaa kisaan ko zyada se zyada chah maheene ke liye lone miltaa he
 As soon as the grain falls in the mandi and the check of the payment is received, the farmers get a call to repay the loan first
 tippaniyan Now in this situation, our banks do not torture the farmers any less than the moneylenders
 phir bhi kisaan credit card ne unhen kai prakaar kii suvidhaayen di hai lekin kisaan ek aise chakra main fansaa he jisase wo nikal hi nahin saktaa
 It does not come out even when the weather is not bad
 fark itnaa hota he ki ek ummid ban jaati he ki uske achche din aa gaye hai
 Actually, good days of farmers do not come
 behatar he tivi band kiijie or mandiyon main jaaiye
 There you will find out how the farmer God has been relied upon
 mandiyon main unke baithne kii vyavastha dekh aaiye
 Shame on you raaton ko paharaa dene ke liye koi chaukeedaar nahin hota
 There is no police
 kisaan raatbhar jagakar apane anaaj kii chaukeedaari karata he
 This is when looking at the TV channels, it seems that our leaders must be working for the farmers
 hamaari kheti ek gambhir sankat se guzar rahi he

 rajya sarkarein apane nigamon ke zariye mandiyon se anaaj kharidti hai
 There is an intermediary between the farmer and these corporations that we call agents and agents
 ye aadhati pidiyon se chale aa rahe hai or zyaadaatar ek hi jatigat samaaj se sambandh rakhte hai
 The farmer brings wheat from the field and keeps it in the market
 uske baad ek karmchaaree aata he to gehun kii nami kii maatra tay karata he or parchez inspector ko kareedne kii anumati de detaa he
 From weighing the wheat of the farmer to filling it into sacks and loading it in trucks, it is the job of transporting it to the godowns of corporations
 iske liye aadhati ko har pachaas kilo gehun kii bori par chah rupee kii mazaduri deni padati he
 In return, the buying agency pays a commission of 2
5 percent to the agent
 agar 1450 rupee prati quintal gehun kaa kareed mulya he to usamen aadhati ko 35-36 rupee milte hai
 Now i could not understand that it gets two and a half percent separately to the adhati or he deducts the labor and commission money from the 1450 in the wheat sack
 aadhati trakon se agenciyon ke paas pahunchaa detaa he
 The buying agencies check the quality of the wheat and deduct a portion of the Rs 1450 if found to be deficient
 iske liye nami kii maatra se lekar toote hue daanon kii maatra kaa pratishat tay hota he
 It is so complicated that you will pass in Algebra but not in the faction
 aadhati kahata he ki agar usne kisaanon ko 1450 rupee de diye or kharid agency ne quality ke aadhaar par kam bhugtan kiya to uskaa nuksaan ho jayega
 However, the farmer will never know that on what basis and in what quantity his wheat quality is weakened and money is cut
 ab yah aadhati kii eemaandaaree par hi nirbhar karata he
 Hence, the agent in the mandi does not give a firm slip to the farmers
 jabaki aadhati ko pakki parchi deni chahie jise je form kehete hai
 In this receipt, the total price and rate of wheat is written with the name of the village and the farmer
 pakki parchi dene kaa matlab puraa paisa dena hoga
 Giving raw pulp means that the agent will cut the money of the farmer later that the price of your wheat has got only 1300 rupees
 kanuunan use kachi parchi nahin deni chahie
 Then when the government has said that all wheat will be purchased
 media main aisi khabaren aati hai magar zamin par sab nahin karidaa jaataa
 All the layers of rules are fixed for which wheat will be purchased
 ek nazar main ham is aadhati ko hataa den to bahut si samasya khatm ho jaaegi
 When the mandi is there, the farmer has to come and sell the grain and there is a government agency to buy, so why are these agents on permanent and caste basis
 iskaa doosraa paksh or bhi he
 If the exploitation can be the reason for exploitation, then it is also the partner of farmers in trouble
 kisaan kehete hai ki bank vaale karz dene ke liye zamin girvee par rakhwa lete hai
 a lot of time is left in paperwork while the agent gives loan on the basis of faith
 jab kisaan ke paas atirikt paisa hota he to wo aadhati ke yahaan hi nivesh karata he kyonki aadhati bank se zyaada byaaz detaa he
 The farmer may be angry with the agent but will not revolt against him because he is trapped in a cycle
 kisaanon ne kaha ki ve bank se zyada aadhati se karza lete hai
 The bank gives loans for agriculture, not personal loans, instead of land
 aadhati personal lone bhi detaa he
 The money is easily available from the agent, but the rules of recovery are very strict
 byaaz dar bainkon se bahut zyaada he
 Not only this, a farmer said that if a loan of two lakh rupees is taken, then it will have to be repaid simultaneously
 aadha chukaayenge to aadhati karz kii puri raashi par alag se dhai pratishat or byaaz le legaa
 In this way Sood becomes more than the original
 jab desh ke netaa kehete hai ki sahukaaron se kisaanon ko mukt karaayenge to puraa sach nahin bolte
 They know who the moneylender is
 aadhati hi wo sahuukaar hai jiske kai sadsy inhen partiyon main bade bade netaa hote hai
 Therefore, if the method is finished then the farmer will end, but if the method continues, the farmer will end
 aap is pankti ko dhyaan se padhate rahiye or yah samajhiye ki jab ham ek makaan ke liye lone lete hai to selary ke aadhaar par pachaas lakh ke makaan ke liye pantis lakh tak kaa lone mil jaataa he
 Our job is also not confirmed
 kabhi bhi ja sakati he
 But if the farmer goes for a loan, first he will pledge one crore of his land with the banks and then he will get a loan of 2
5 lakh
 ek kisaan ne aaj mujhe yahi bataaya
 The loan that i will get from the bank will be available for ten or twenty years, the farmer gets a loan for at least six months
 mandi main anaaj girte hi or bhugtan kaa check milte hi kisaanon ko phone aane lagata he ki pehle lone chukaayiye
 The comments ab is sthiti main hamaare bank bhi kisaanon ke saath sahukaaron se kam atyaachaar nahin karte hai
 Even then the Kisan Credit Card has given him many facilities but the farmer is stuck in a cycle from which he cannot get out
 mausam karaab nahin hone par bhi wo nahin nikal paata he
 The difference is that one hopes that good days have come
 darasal kisaanon ke achche din aate hi nahin he
 It is better to turn off the TV and go to the mandis
 vahaan pataa chalegaa ki kaise kisaan bhagwaan bharose chhod diya gaya he
 Look at their seating arrangement in the mandis
 aapako shame aegi
 There is no watchman to guard the nights
 police nahin hoti
 The farmer awakens throughout the night and guards his grain
 yah sab tab he jab tivi channelon ko dekhakar aisa lagata he ki hamaare netaa kisaanon ke liye kitna kaam kar rahe honge

 Look at their seating arrangement in the mandis
 aapako shame aegi
 There is no watchman to guard the nights
 police nahin hoti
 The farmer awakens throughout the night and guards his grain
 yah sab tab he jab tivi channelon ko dekhakar aisa lagata he ki hamaare netaa kisaanon ke liye kitna kaam kar rahe honge
 At a glance, if we remove this job, many problems will be eliminated
 jab mandi he, vahaan kisaan ko aakar anaaj bechnaa he or kharidne ke liye sarkari agency he to sthaayee or jatigat aadhaar par ye agent kyon hai
 There is another side to it
 aadhati shoshan kaa kaaran ho saktaa he to yahi musiibat main kisaanon kaa saathi bhi he
 Farmers say that the bankers get the land mortgaged for lending
 kaagazi karrwai main hi kaaphi vakt nikal jaataa he jabaki aadhati vishwaas ke aadhaar par karz de detaa he
 When the farmer has additional money, he invests with the agent only because the agent pays more interest than the bank
 kisaan aadhati se naaraaz ho saktaa he magar uske kilaaf khulaa vidroh nahin karegaa kyonki wo ek chakra main fansaa he
 The farmers said that they borrow more from the bank than the agent
 bank to zamin ke badale kheti ke liye lone detaa he, personal lone nahin detaa
 Arrati also gives personal loans
 aadhati se sirf paisa aasaani se miltaa he lekin vasuuli ke niyam behad sakht hai
 The rate of interest is much higher than banks
 itnaa hi nahin, ek kisaan ne bataaya ki agar do lakh rupee karj liya he to ek saath chukaana hoga
 If you pay half, then you will get another two and a half percent interest on the entire amount of the borrower loan
 is tarah se sood mul se zyada ho jaataa he
 When the country's leaders say that they will free the farmers from the moneylenders, they do not speak the whole truth
 unhen pataa hota he ki sahuukaar koun he
 They are the moneylender whose members are very big leaders in these parties
 isliye aadhati khatm hoga to kisaan or khatm hoga magar aadhati rahegaa to kisaan khatm hoga hi
 You should keep reading this line carefully and understand that when we take a loan for a house, on the basis of salary, you get a loan of up to thirty five lakh for a house of fifty lakhs
 hamaari naukari bhi pakki nahin he
 Can go anytime
 lekin kisaan karz lene jayega to pehle ek karod kii apni zamin bainkon ke paas girvee rakhega phir use dhai lakh kaa lone milegaa
 This is what a farmer told me today
 mujhe bank se jo lone milegaa wo das yaa bees saal ke liye milegaa kisaan ko zyada se zyada chah maheene ke liye lone miltaa he
 As soon as the grain falls in the mandi and the check of the payment is received, the farmers get a call to repay the loan first
 tippaniyan Now in this situation, our banks do not torture the farmers any less than the moneylenders
 phir bhi kisaan credit card ne unhen kai prakaar kii suvidhaayen di hai lekin kisaan ek aise chakra main fansaa he jisase wo nikal hi nahin saktaa
 It does not come out even when the weather is not bad
 fark itnaa hota he ki ek ummid ban jaati he ki uske achche din aa gaye hai
 Actually, good days of farmers do not come
 behatar he tivi band kiijie or mandiyon main jaaiye
 There you will find out how the farmer God has been relied upon
 mandiyon main unke baithne kii vyavastha dekh aaiye
 Shame on you raaton ko paharaa dene ke liye koi chaukeedaar nahin hota
 There is no police
 kisaan raatbhar jagakar apane anaaj kii chaukeedaari karata he

 While Prakash Javadekar whipped the Congress, on the other hand, described the BJP as the party that can benefit the country
 laalkrishna adwani kii kathith beemaari ke mudde par unhone kaha ki ve sachmuch biimaar hai
 Also, asked the reporters to wait till tomorrow (sunday) on any major decision taken by the party (possibly regarding Modi)
 jaavdekar ne kaha ki rajnath singh ne kaha he ki vartmaan congress sarkaar ne desh main sankat paidaa kar diya he
 The 9-year-old report card of the Congress is a card of failure and public confidence has been lost on it
 'badalte mausam se biimaar hue adwani'prakaash jaavdekar ne shanivaar ko press conference main kaha ki adwani ji sachmuch biimaar hai
 The doctor has advised them to rest
 isi vajah se ve agle 3-4 din tak keval aaraam karenge
 Javadekar said that Rajnath Singh has also advised Advani not to take stress
 jaavdekar ne bataaya ki adwani ne bijepi kaaryakartaaon ko shubhakamanaayen di hai
 When Prakash Javadekar was asked about Advani's illness, he said that it is because of changing weather, there is no major disease
 jaavdekar ne kaha ki adwani unke maardarshak rahe hai or hameshaa rahenge
 'we gave the glass full', referring to the speech of BJP President Rajnath Singh, Javadekar said that the BJP had given the filled glass to the Congress
 tab desh kii growth rate 8
 It was 4 and now it is at 4

 PM kept morality so that parbajp once again surrounded PM Manmohan Singh regarding coal scam

 Although BJP is giving different reasons for everyone, but everyone knows that smoke never arises without fire
 mishan 2014 ke liye bijepi ne mahamanthan to shuru kiya, lekin adwani ke bina
 According to party sources, Advani was angry at Modi's name, so did not come to the meeting and cited poor health
 haalanki ek din pehle tak bijepi baithak main adwani ke aane kaa daawa kar rahi thi
 Party president Rajnath Singh himself also said that Advani would come, but the differences became so big, the cracks increased so much that Advani withdrew from the national executive meeting
 nahin pahunche kai diggajabaat adwani kii naaraazgi par hi khatm nahin hui
 Before the start of the meeting of the National Executive, there had been reports of many party leaders not coming
 menka gandhi, bisi khanduri, yashavanth sinha jaise netaa baithak main nahin pahunche
 Earlier leaders like Jaswant Singh and Uma Bharti have also left the meeting of the National Executive
 haalanki sabane kharaab sehat kaa hawala diya, lekin yashavanth sinha ne ishaaron-ishaaron main modi ke khilaaf tevar dikhaae or saaf-saaf kaha ki unhen 'namo'nia nahin hua he
 By now it was clear that the BJP had been divided in the name of Modi, but it was constantly said on behalf of the party that there is no discord, no estrangement

 bharat ke matadaataaon ne badi taadaad main khandaani shashan kii bajaae majboot netritv, sarkari meharbaani kii jagah naukari or bharat ke vividh samudaayon ko tusht karne or lubhaane kii niti kii jagah sushasan ke haq main vot diya he
 All these options have been on the chariot of the populist slogans of Modinomics and the promise of a corruption-free progressive India
 kuch kar dikhaane kii kshamta ko chunane kii yah pravriti may, 2013 main bhi saamne ai thi, jab pakistan ke matadaataaon ne nai sarkaar chuni thi or bharat kii hi tarah pakistan piples party ko thukrakar vikaas ke liye zyada anukool navaj sharif ko chunaa tha
 Overall, this is a good omen for the region that the voter is getting smarter and the young population cut off from the past is desperate to have a better life
 dakshinpanth kii taraf bharat kaa jhukaav bhi pakistan se kuch alag nahin he
 The world view of the second largest party that emerged under the leadership of Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz and former cricketer Imran Khan, won in the 2013 election, is also right-wing
 ab donon deshon ko alpsankhyakon ke mudde se nibatna hoga
 Minor non-muslim population and Shia minority population are under attack in Pakistan
 2014 ke chunaav ke baad bharat kii sansad main muslim saansadon kii sankhya sabase kam he
 This tremendous recognition of politics and religion culminated in a political process that began a century ago, where religion was incorporated into politics and faith became a part of political ideology
 isliye pakistan main bahut-se log, khaskar dhur dakshinpanthi tatv modi ke pradhanmantri chune jane par chupchaap khushi manaa rahe hai
 Modi is also the modern face of Hindutva as well as its modern face
 isse pakistan ke astitv kaa auchity siddh ho jaataa he
 Truth may be far from this simple explanation, but the art of airing ideas and exploiting them is politics
 misaal ke taur par pakistan main pramukh bharat virdohi swar jamaat-ud-daawa ke hafiz mohammad said kaa kahana tha ki bharat ke chunaav main bijepi kii jeet ne ‘‘bhartiya dharmanirpekshata kii pole khol di he
 "many of us want a more normal and mature relationship with our older and slightly crooked neighbor
" aise logon ko saavdhaan karte hue said ne kaha ki dosti (maano maujuud ho) ko ab jari nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 Many people like Saeed believe that the elections in India were fought on anti-pakistan and anti-islam sentiments
 haalanki yah atishyokti he, phir bhi modi ne gujarat ke chote-se muslim alpsankhyak varg ke saath jaisaa beraham bartaav kiya he, usase pakistani janamat main aise vichaaron ko takat milti he
 Moving from the south to the path of the middle, optimists like Senator Mushahid Hussain, Chairman of the Defense Committee of Parliament, are more excited
 bhartiya chunaav par raay dete hue unhone kaha ki modi apane aarthik agenda se sanchalit honge or ummid he ki atal bihari vaajapeyi kii kaaryastylee se prerana lenge
 Most of Pakistan's analysts and political parties also believe this
 pradhanmantri vaajapeyi ne bas se pakistan aakar jo pahal kii thi or 1940 ke lahore prastaav ke smarak par jane ke liye jo vishesh prayaas kiya tha, uski donon deshon ke sambandhon par chhap amit he
 Both Sharif and Pervez Musharraf had relations with Vajpayee and his Nixon-like approach to dialogue with the region is a legacy for the new Prime Minister of India, which will be beneficial to remember when formulating the country's foreign policy
 nai sarkaar ke saath pakistan ke sambandh is baat par nirbhar hai ki modi desh main koun-sa rasta apanaate hai
 If Modi is going to fulfill his many promises of economic growth, trade and prosperity, then peace in the region will be in India's highest interest
 iske vipareet yadi bahut kam prachaarit lekin har jagah maujuud atirashtrawaad or mardaangi dikhaane ke raste ko chunaa gaya, to pakistan ko phikr kerani chahie
 Experts would have advised to adopt tactical rhetoric towards Pakistan
 phir bhi nai sarkaar ke liye ek pakistan niti bananaa behad jaruri he
 Till now, this policy has been swinging between the quick reaction to terrorist incidents and the familiarity associated with the sour memories of the politicians of the older generation
 26 november ko mumbai main hue hamalon ke bare main media se sanchalit janata kii yaaddaasht aaj bhi aam janamat par haaavee he
 It is not that this incident should be forgotten, because any incident of terror is unacceptable, but limiting diplomatic options, especially for a country that aspires for regional leadership
 agar bhartiya media ke sanket sach hai, to modi desh kii videsh or suraksha nitiyon ko badalane vaale hai
 If they are also trying to include bjp's manifesto in the government's policies, then there is going to be an era of tremendous competition in indo-pak relations
 isaki shuruyaat sabase pehle afghanistan main dikhaai degi
 Many people fear that if both countries continue to deny the importance of dialogue, then the proxy war between India and Pakistan may intensify
 dilli main baithe aakraamak soch vaale log modi par pakistan kii taraf se takat ke asmaan pradarshan kaa jawaab dene kii aakraamak niti apnaane ke liye dabaav daal sakate hai
 If this happens, then the attitude of Pakistan, especially its security establishment, will get even hotter
 ummid karte hai ki aisi sthiti paidaa nahin hogi
 One of Pakistan's strategic thinkers is concerned that the BJP has always invested in the Indian Army and has tried to modernize it
 isse bhi pakistani satark honge
 Pakistan is already responding to the Indian Army's policy of continuing conventional warfare below the scope of Pakistan's nuclear power
 jab donon deshon ke netaa vikaas, naukari or bullate train ke sapane dikhaa rahe hai, to hathiyaaron kii hode kii donon ko hi jarurat nahin he
 The relations between India and Pakistan need to be freed from both the bureaucratic network and the multiplicity of the military and they should focus more on mutual economic cooperation, which can gradually build trust
 kya modi yah rasta chunane ko taiyaar honge? yah to vakt hi batayega
 The Prime Minister of Pakistan has congratulated Modi and invited him to come here
 desh ke prashasnic pratishthan main bahut se logon kaa maananaa he ki pakistan modi ke saath kaam kar saktaa he
 There are also reports that there have been contacts behind the scenes in recent months
 par jab bharat kaa suraksha pratishthan, media ke kuch hisse or bijepi ke kaaryakarta pakistan ko sirf aatankwaad ke nazariye se dekhte hai, to kya modi uske saath behatar sambandh rakhana chahenge? usase bhi bada sawaal yah he ki satta ke vyavhaar or niti nirdhaaran par bijepi kii vichaardhaara kaa asar kis had tak hoga?modi or unke saathi chaahe koi bhi rasta chune, unhen vaajapeyi kii yah bhavpurn kavita yaad rakhni chahie, ‘‘ab jang na hone denge
 "friendship may be far away, but the people of India and Pakistan certainly have the right to expect mature dialogue from their leaders
 pakistan main pradhananmatri navaj sharif dhire-dhire lekin lagaataar bharat ke prati niti apane haath main lene kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Whatever approach the two sides take on the ideological level, mutual diplomacy including dialogue behind the scenes should continue
 bharat main modi kaa udai sambhaavnaaon se bharaa hua he
 There should be a well-thought-out Pakistani policy in their quiver and negotiations with the civilian government of Pakistan will be fruitful
 pichley varsh disambar main sainya sanchaalan mahanideshkon kii baithak se prerana lete hue sena ke bich sampark bhi behatar hona chahie
 There is a general consensus in Pakistan that relations should be normal and trade should grow
 bijepi sarkaar ke liye chunauti niti ko badalane or aapasi sambandhon ko nayaa rup dene ke behatar raste talashne kii ho sakati he
 (raza Rumi is the advisory editor of The Friday Times Pakistan and author of Delhi by Heart: Impressions of a Pakistani Traveler) bollywood film nirmaataa subhash ghai ko karaara jhatka dete hue bombai hoicourt ne unhen unke mahatvakankshi film institute 'visaling woods international' ke liye aavantit kii gai zamin lautaane kaa aadesh diya he
 The comments ek janhit yachika par faisla sunaate hue court ne kaha ki zamin gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se aavantit kii gai
 The court directed Ghai to allot 14 to the film school in his possession as open land
 5 acre zamin turant sarkaar ko lautaa den, tathaa studio va film institute ke kabje main maujuud 5
 Return 5 acres by July 31, 2014
 court ne ghai se varsh 2000 se 5
 3 crores has also been asked to pay rent annually
 is faisle ko kendriya vigyaan evam takneekee mantri vilasarav deshmukh ke liye sharmindagi kaa kaaran mana ja rahaa he, kyonki goregaanv sthit filmacity main yah zamin unheen ke mukhyamantritv kaal main ghai ke saath ek sanyukt upkram ke tahat film institute kholane ke naam par aavantit kii gai thi
 While awarding the verdict on a PIL, the court said that the land was illegally allotted
 court ne ghai ko nirdesh diya ki vah unke kabje main open land ke rup main maujuud film skool ke liye aavantit kii gai 14
 Return 5 acres of land immediately to the government, and 5 in the possession of the studio and film institute
 5 acre jameen 31 july, 2014 tak lautaaen
 Court from Ghai from the year 2000 to 5
 3 karod rupee salanaa ke hisaab se kiraaya dene ke liye bhi kaha he
 The decision is considered a cause of shame for Union Science and Technology Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, as the land was allotted to filmcity in Goregaon in the name of opening a film institute under a joint venture with Ghai during his chief ministership

 With the completion of voting for the Gujarat elections, the results of the exit poll came out
 ye nattejey congress ke navnirvaachit adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke liye buree khabar kii aahat lekar aae hai
 Despite months of hard work and strict caste equations, the Congress is losing power in Himachal Pradesh, according to the exit poll, while in Gujarat too its seats are not showing much increase
 adhyaksh banane se pehle rahul jis taiyaari or tevar ke saath gujarat chunaav main utre, wo abhootpurv thi
 His confidence was clearly visible
 yah nayaa avatar congress adhyaksh ke rup main unke nae daayitv ko or majboot bhi karata he
 But a week after the announcement of his name as the Speaker, the Gujarat and Himachal assembly election results are coming and if the exit poll results come true then Rahul will have to answer some sharp questions
 haar kii jimmedaari se kaise bachenge?rahul ke aalochak kehete hai ki unke puure raajnneetik kariyar main keval or keval haar hi basii hui he
 Wherever he went to campaign, the party kept losing
 lekin congress adhyaksh kaa pad unki maa sonia gandhi ke paas hone ke kaaran rahul kii maujuudagi main haar congress party kii haar bhi maani jaati rahi
 Now that he has become the party president and was seen as a rage among the people in Gujarat rather than as an outsider, the Congress' defeat in the Gujarat and Himachal elections will be straightforwardly defeated
 aalochak kahenge ki chaahe kaman, party or sarvadhikaar rahul ko de do, unki kismat main haar hi he

 gujarat chunaav kii wo sabase ahm baat jisapar tay hogi jeet or haaranvi main sudhaar, phir kyon bantaadhaar?rahul nihsandeh nae avatar main nazar aa rahe hai
 The perception about them is changing rapidly
 rahul kaa aatmavishvaas behatar nazar aa rahaa he or unka bolnaa, chizon kaa jawaab dena, haazirajavaabi bhi sudhari nazar aa rahi he
 For the first time, Rahul appears like a mature leader
 unhen vipaksh bhi mriganauna maanane kii bhul nahin kar saktaa he
 But the defeat of Gujarat would open the opportunity for him to re-attack the fiery attacks of mockery
 rahul kii chhavi main sudhaar ko is vakt ek pratyaksh pramaan kii zarurat he lekin agsit pole ke mutabik gujarat chunaavon main use ye pramaan miltaa nahin dikhataa
 How will Kshatrapa trust in the new commander? It is also important for Rahul to win Gujarat because he is taken seriously in his own party, it is necessary for him to prove himself
 rahul puraa jor lagaakar bhi gujarat main congress kii naiya paar nahin lagaate dikh rahe
 In such a situation, on what basis will he promise to guarantee victory from his party's faces in the rest of the states
 aane vaale dinon main rajasthan, madhyapradesh jaise rajyon main chunaav honge
 New party leaders are emerging there too
 rahul unase jeet kii guarantee tabhi maang sakate the jab wo khud aisa karke dikhaaen
 But according to exit polls, he is getting failure
 ye bhi padhein
 
 
 More than Rahul, PM is decisive for Modi, how will the mandate of Gujarat stop the opposing voices in the party? There is a large number of leaders in the Congress party who will be gradually marginalized and become less relevant in Rahul style politics
 aise main gujarat ke nattejey agsit pole ke mutabik hi rahe to yahi netaa party ke andar asantosh ko hawa denge
 Slogans such as factionalism and Sonia Lao, Save Congress can also be given
 yahaan tak ki party main neeche ke str par kaaryakarta kaa hatotsahit hona sanghathan ko bachaane or phir se khadaa karne kii drushti se bahut baari pad saktaa he
 At this time, Rahul also has to add enthusiasm to his workers and also shut the mouth of anti-rahul elements
 isamen gujarat kii jeet sahaayak siddh ho sakati thi lekin afsos aisa hota nahin dikh rahaa
 On what basis will the opposition consider the leader? a full year after the Gujarat elections, 2018 is the time to create politics in the country for the next general election
 is samay rahul kii jeet hi unhen vipaksh or modi se asantusht logon ke liye ek vikalp ke taur par saamne laa sakati thi
 But exit poll results show that this is not going to happen
 ab vipaksh rahul main sambhaavnaaen dekhne se inkaar karegaa or banta vipaksh modi ke khilaaf ek vyapak ranneeti taiyaar karne se chook jayega

 His victory in Gujarat would have carried a big message that would have an impact in the upcoming assembly elections and also on national politics
 rahul kii badi hui shakti hi unhen vipaksh ke kisi bade manch ko sanchalit kar paane kii kshamta de sakati thi
 If the exit poll results are true, Rahul will lose this golden opportunity

 This is because nowadays, either the lead role matters or the item song in the film

 The rise of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) anti-corruption warrior Arvind Kejriwal has not only scared the national political parties of India, but there is a fear among some separatist leaders in Jammu and Kashmir
 ve is baat se dare hue hai ki sambhavat: yah party rajya main apana prabhaav bana legi
 This is evident from the statement issued by Mohammad Yasin Malik, one of the separatist leaders
 dilli main aap kii shandaar jeet ke baad jammu evam kashmir libration front netaa yaccin hi vah pehle shaks the, jinhone aap ko 'kashmir virdohi' party kii oopaadhi di
 Not only this, when AAP leader Prashant Bhushan suggested a referendum on the presence of armed forces in populated areas, Malik gave him the title of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) man
 vahiin, bhaajapa ne unhen algaavvaadiyon kaa agent qaraar diya
 Not only Yasin Malik, but Syed Ali Shah Geelani also targeted Bhushan
 yah dekhne main bahut hi dilachasp baat he ki kyon jammu evam kashmir ke algaavvaadi netaa aap party se dare hue hai
 These separatist leaders have always been sidelined due to their corrupt conduct or the space created by mainstream parties
 aise main ab aap ke aavirbhaav or uske rashtriya prabhaav kii vajah se jammu evam kashmir rajya kii raajnneeti main iske pravesh par ek bahes chhid gai he
 This is the reason why separatist leaders were irritated when some intellectuals and civil society groups started discussing AAP as an alternative in Jammu and Kashmir
 yahaan tak ki mukhyamantri umr abdulla bhi jammu evam kashmir main aap party kii lokapriyata or iske aakarshan se sahame dikhte hai

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi celebrated his 69th birthday among the people of his parliamentary constituency Kashi

 In the election year, political meanings are being extracted to reach PM Kavaranasip and to award crores of development projects

 In this form, the SEBP was seated in power in the 2014 Lok Sabha and 2017 assembly elections, securing maximum seats from UP
 ab 2019 kii jang fatah karne ke liye phir mishan purvanchal par apni nigahen jamaa di hai
 In order to practice Purvanchal, PM Modi reached Kashi on Monday on a two-day visit
 is dauraan apane sansadeey kshetra varanasi ko 500 karod ke vikaas pariyojnaon ke tohfe se nawaja
 In this, electrical works (electricity) Old Kashi 36200 lakhs, 33 in 11 KV electrical sub station Betawar-279 lakhs, Atal Incubation Center 2000 lakhs, Nagespur Village Drinking Water Scheme-275 lakhs, 33 in 11 electrical stations, Kurusato Nirma-260 lakhs
 The release is included
 narendra modi ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main varanasi se utarkar vipaksh kaa safaya kar diya tha
 He influenced the election results from Varanasi to Bihar in UP
 azamgarh purvanchal kii iklauti seat thi, jahaan bijepi nahin jeet saki thi
 The rest of the Lok Sabha seats of Purvanchal went to bjp's account
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhi bijepi ne yahi ranneeti apanaai or piem narendra modi ne chunaav prachaar ke aakhri ke teen din varanasi main rahakar vipaksh ko dharashayi kar diya tha
 Now once again, Modi has started the exercise to make Kashi his battlefield to conquer 2019
 gauratlab he ki modi ko satta main aane se rokane ke liye upi main vipakshi dal ekajute ho rahe hai
 In the Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha by-elections of Purvanchal, the BJP was troubled by the unity of the SP-BSP
 iske baad vipaksh kii ekta kii takat kii ajamaaish pashchim upi ke kairana main bhi dikhi, jahaan areldi ne bijepi ko shikast di
 Encouraged by the formula of victory in the by-elections, SP, BSP and Congress are planning to enter into a grand alliance in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 teenon dalon ke bich siton ke bantwaare ko lekar manthan jari he
 SP President Akhilesh Yadav is ready to make every compromise to stop the BJP
 ajtak ke mind rox program main unhone kaha tha ki 2019 main bijepi ko rokane ke liye harsambhav koshish karenge or siton ke samjhaute ke liye do kadam peeche bhi hatana padaa to ham taiyaar hai
 If the Opposition enters the Grand Alliance in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, it will not be easy for the BJP to repeat the results like 2014
 kaashi jaisi loksabhaa seat chhod den to purvanchal kii zyaadaatar siten bijepi ke haathon se nikal sakati hai
 If the Purvanchal slips from the hands of BJP then it will be difficult to reach the power of the country
 upi ke badale siyaasi mizaaj ke tahat bijepi ke liye purvanchal ko sadhana kaaphi ahm ho gaya he
 Perhaps this is the reason why PM Modi is forced to celebrate his birthday in Kashi 
 bijepi pashchimi uttar pradesh ke mukaable purvi uttar pradesh par zyada focus kar rahe hai
 PM Modi has started to weave Mission-2019 from Kashi in Purvanchal
 isse pehle mulaayam ke garh azamgarh main uttar pradesh sarkaar kii sabase badi pariyojna purvanchal express-ve kii neenv rakhi thi
 This will be the largest expressway in the country

 At the same time, the CM of Delhi has said that if PM Modi cannot give security to the CM of Delhi, then he should resign
 siem arvind kejariwal ne dilli vidhansabha main kaha ki dilli police ek sanstha he or police ko apane sammaan kii raksha kerani chahie
 Aam Aadmi Party mlas raised the issue of attacks on CM and no action by Delhi Police thereafter
 aap vidhayakon ne sadan main kaha ki shahid hone kii haalat mendilli policeko di jane vaali ek karod rupee kii sammaan raashi yojana ko khatm kiya jaae, lekin siem ne vidhayakon kii is maang se asahmati jataai
 The CM said that it is not right to blame the Delhi Police for the attacks that are taking place on them and the attitude of the police after that, but behind all this is the dirty politics of the BJP
 kejariwal ne kaha ki bijepi dilli police ko mohara bana rahi he, lekin dilli police ko apane saathiyon kii shahadat kaa sammaan karnaa chahie
 Kejriwal said that he will always be with the Delhi Police, but Modi will never be with the policemen
 kejariwal ne kaha ki duty par shahid hone vaale jin 18 shaheedon ko ek karod rupee kii sammaan raashi di ja rahi he, unamem se 11 dilli police ke sipaahi hai
 Kejriwal said that the Delhi Police should come under the purview of the elected government so that Delhi's law and order can be corrected and the police should be accountable to the government
 unhone kaha ki dilli main aap sarkaar se pehle skool, aspataalon kii buree haalat thi or log teachers or doctoron ko koste the, lekin aaj vahi teachers or doctor hai, jinke kaaran halaat badal gaye hai
 Kejriwal said that if the Delhi Police is also under the government, then these policemen will protect the people of Delhi
 siem ne kaha ki pichley teen saal main un par chaar baar hamale hue hai or ek bhi maamle main chargeshit tak daakhil nahin hui
 Kejriwal said, "the question is why these attacks took place? The people of Delhi have made a secret that they have made a common man a CM and that is why BJP is now taking revenge on the people of Delhi
" bijepi ke ye hamale sidhe dilli kii janata par hai
 BJP has carried out all four attacks on the people of Delhi
 "kejariwal ne kaha ki dilli sachivalay main haal hi main hue hamale ke baad kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh ne unhen phone kiya or unhone grih mantri ko yahi kaha ki yaa to in hamalon main centre kaa haath he yaa phir centre dilli ke siem ko suraksha dene main fail hue hai
 The CM said that the Delhi Police is directly under the Center and if PM Modi cannot provide security to the Delhi CM, then the PM should resign
 jithan ram maanjhi ko samarthan dene ke bare main bijepi alaakaman ke faisle main badlaav party ke vidhayakon ke mood ko dekhte hue aayaa
 According to the sources, the reaction from the mlas at the meeting of the legislature party at the house of party leader Sushil Kumar Modi last night surprised the party high command
 vahiin, jithan ram maanjhi ne aaj subah kaha ki unhone vidhayakon se samarthan maanga he party se nahin
 Most of the mlas in Bihar BJP were of the opinion that the BJP should vote in favor of Manjhi and not walk out during the trust vote as the party high command is thinking
 bijepi vidhayakon ne ek sur main kaha ki wo apane-apane chunaav kshetron se waapas aa rahe hai
 Mahadalits everywhere have anger against Nitish Kumar
 wo is baat se naaraaz hai ki nitish ek mahadalit netaa jithan ram maanjhi kaa apmaan kar rahe hai
 According to the legislators, it is being asked that if Manjhi was to be humiliated in such a way, then why did Nitish Kumar make him the chief minister? ye vahi mahadalit hai jinhone pichley lok sabha chunaav main ek sire se nitish kumaar kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Many BJP leaders will meet saying that after waiting for long queues and hours at many polling stations, the Mahadalit community voted one way in favor of Janata Dal United
 bijepi ke ranneetikaar is vishleshan ko sahi nahin maanate ki maanjhi ko samarthan dene se bijepi kaa oonchi jati kaa samarthak vot usase chhitak jayega
 He asks what Manjhi has done in the last nine months which goes against the upper castes
 unke ek-do bayaan jarur oonchi jatiyon ke khilaaf gaye hai, magar sirf bayanon kii buniyaad par maanjhi kaa virodh karne main koi tuk nahin he
 He also says that in such a situation when Nitish Kumar has tied up with Lalu Prasad, the upper castes cannot go with Nitish under any circumstances
 oonchi jatiyon, gaiyr yadav-kurmi pichde varg or mahadaliton ko saath lekar bijepi lalu-nitish ke muslim-yadav-kurmi vot ko maat de sakati he
 That is why BJP is supporting Manjhi, knowing that he will not be able to prove his majority

 The BJP will keep Manjhi with him but he will not be included in the party
 maanjhi pappu yadav or kuch duusare netaaon ke saath apni party bana sakate hai
 BJP can coordinate with this party
 bijepi chaahegi ki in chah maheenon main maanjhi har vidhansabha seat par jaaen or vahaan ja kar bataaen ki kis tarah se nitish kumaar ne ek mahadalit kaa apmaan kiya he
 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi and former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Prasad Yadav came face to face on Friday on the issue of corruption and benami property
 rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ke netaa va purv upmukhyamantri tejasvi prasad yadav ne upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi par apane bhai kii companiyon ke jariye kaale dhan ko safed karwaane kaa aarope lagaaya to sunil modi ne bhi safai dete hue tejasvi par 26 varsh kii umr main 26 benami sampattiyon ke maalik hone kaa aarope lagaate hue unase jawaab maanga
 Tejashwi Yadav had alleged that Sushil Modi himself has acquired benami property of crores by corruption and he owes his black money to his brother R

 They make whites through Modi's companies
 tejasvi kaa yah bayaan us samay aayaa jab susheel modi lagaataar lalu prasad ke parivaar ke khilaaf benami sampatti ko lekar lagaataar khulaasa karte rahe hai
 Tejashwi said, “R

 vittamantri rahete susheel modi ne bihar ke khajaane kii hifaazat nahin kii
 The Deputy Chief Minister was also accused of wrongly buying a flat
 flats kharidne sambandhi rajd ke aaropon kaa karaara jawaab dete hue upmukhyamantri sumo ne kaha, "maine to isiaisiai bank se 10 lakh rupee karj lekar or shesh raashi check ke jariye dekar flats kharida, jisaki sari jaankaree inakam tex ritern or chunaav ayog ko detaa rahaa hum

 i have been an MLA and a minister for 25 years

 BJP is also trying to gain a foothold here
 chitoor loksabhaa kshetra main kabhi congress kaa ekatarfa raaj tha
 This can be gauged from the fact that the Congress has won the maximum number of victories in the 11 general elections from this seat
 haalanki, 1982 main tidipi ke astitv main aane ke baad congress kaa teji se patan hua or 1982 ke baad hue 9 aam chunaavon main congress ke mahaj do baar hi jeet mil saki, jabaki 7 baar yah seat tidipi ke paas gai
 After the formation of TDP in 1982, general elections were held in 1984, in which the seat of TDP founder NT Rama Rao was also defeated by the Congress
 haalanki, 1989 main congress ne ek baar phir se vaapasi kii or 1991 main seat par jeet hasil kii, lekin congress kii jeet kaa silsilaa yaheen tham gaya or iske baad hue 6 aam chunaavon main tidipi kaa lagaataar is seat par kabja rahaa he
 In the 2014 general elections, the TDP leader continued the TDP victory by defeating the YSR Congress candidate

 Premium charges apply !! Even though Narendra Modi has emerged as a skilled administrator today who knows how to keep his perspective wrapped in tight words, his life story is straightforward in which we can certainly find a cool image somewhere
 ek chaay dukandaar ke bete se lekar desh ke sabase taqatvar pradhanmantri banane tak kaa unka samoochaa safar aise chaunkaane vaale kisson or ghatnaon se bharaa padaa he jinase unki shakhsiyat ko aakaar mila he
 Born in 1950 at the home of Damodardas Modi, the owner of a small tea shop at Vadnagar railway station in northern Gujarat, Narendra grew up in a small three-room house with six siblings
 bachapan ke dinon main narendra modi skool se lautakar apane pita kii dukaan par unki madad kiya karte the or aksar kettle main chaay lekar graahakon tak pahunchaaya karte the
 Mr
 B
 of Vadnagar
 en
 In high school, Modi studied till XI
 vahaan unhen medhaavi chaatr mana jaataa tha
 Not surprisingly, he was the best speaker in his class and participated in school plays
 ek baar unhone bhavnagar ke maharaja kaa kirdaar bhi nibhaayaa tha
 He was active in non-education activities and was a skilled cadet of NCC
 vadnagar main rahane vaale unke sahpaathee sudhir joshi bataate hai, ‘‘ve vaaki bahuaiami the
 His other classmate Nagji Desai, with whom Modi used to spend a lot of time, says, "he topped everything he did in school
" ’’modi 1965 main 15 baras kii umr main aresas netaa babubhai nayak ke prabhaav main aakar aresas kii shakha main jane lage
 a few days after this, he started teaching Swami Vivekananda, whose personality and teachings were admired by him
 iske alaava ve do sthaneey sarvodayi netaaon dwarkadas joshi or rasikalal paarikh ke vichaaron se bhi prabhavit the
 The effect of so many inspirations was that within them a mixture of both the intense nationalism taught by the RSS and the Gandhism of Sarvodaya movement
 unke 17 varsh kaa hone ke baad ke paanch varsh kaaphi uthal-puthal vaale rahe or shaayad yahi unke jivan kaa vah hissaa tha jisane unke vyaktitv par sabase gaharaa prabhaav daalaa
 When he was barely 18 years old, his parents got Modi's marriage to his own Ghanchi (teli) community girl Jashodaben against his wishes
 modi ko ek ore aresas or sarvoday kii vichaardhaara saarvajanik seva kii ore pravrutt kar rahi thi to duusari ore ek pati ke taur par gharelu jimmedaariyaan aan padi thim
 Young Modi was finding it difficult to withstand this two-way pressure
 aakhir unhone apni patni se khed jataayaa ki ve pehle yah faisla le paane ke laayak itane majboot nahin the or phir gharbaar chhodkar teen maheene ke liye ve himalay ke ekant main chale gaye
 From there, he did not return home, but made his permanent place in Ahmedabad
 maamuli shuruyatgujarat ke sabase bade shahar main 1960 ke dashak ke ant main modi ne gujarat rajya parivahan nigam kii canteen main suparvizer kaa kaam shuru kiya
 This was the time when he became closely associated with the RSS and was given charge of the local Vishwa Hindu Parishad unit
 ahmedabad main unhen aresas ke kareeb laane kaa shrey ambalal koshti naam ke vyakti ko jaataa he jo aaj bhi gujarat bijepi ke mukhyalay main kaam karte hai
 While working in the RSS in the early 1970s, Modi's contact began to grow from a person who has perhaps the most profound influence on his life - RSS pracharak Laxmanrao Inamdar
 modi kaise unke vishwaasapaatr bane, uskaa ek kissa bahut dilachasp he
 Inamdar paid Modi Rs 50,000 during a three-day camp of the RSS in a remote area of northern Gujarat
 kaa ek bandal sambhaal kar rakhane ko diya
 Modi did not understand how to handle this cash
 tab unhone us jagah par ek gaddha khod daalaa jahaan din ke samay aresas ke netaa baitha karte the
 He buried the bundle of money there itself
 chauthe din subah jab modi ne inaamdaar kii maujuudagi main gadde se paise nikaale, to ve hatprabh rah gaye
 It was Inamdar who made Modi a pracharak at the age of 22, after which Modi resumed his studies and then completed his BA and MA through distance education
 khichdi or curry modi kaa sthaayee bhojan hua karata tha
 He never had special likes and dislikes about food, although he was always conscious about his clothes, shoes and other items
 yahaan tak ki jab ve ahmedabad ke kankaria ilaake main aresas ke mukhyalay main rahete the, us vakt bhi unka pahanava saathi prachaarkon ke bich charchaa kaa vishay rahata tha, jinhen se saadagi bharaa jivan jeene kii sikh di jaati he
 While working as a publicist, he used to give fancy sandals, beautiful kurtas and attractive watches to his loved ones
 jaahir he, ye chijen chhip nahin paati thim or unki peeth peeche is par kaaphi kaanaafoosee chalati rahati thi
 a pracharak of that era said, "modi was not a hypocrite
 ve koi bhadkila jivan nahin jite the, lekin ek saamaanya prachaarak ke jivan ke mukaable beshak unka rahan-sahan behatar hua karata tha
 He believed in spontaneity, not at unnecessary cost
 ’’ un dinon kaa ek or kissa unke bindaas swabhaav or baaki prachaarkon se alag najariya rakhane kaa parichay detaa he
 An RSS pracharak got married to a woman associated with the Sangh, who was disturbed by the inside of the Sangh in Ahmedabad and people were upset
 yah joda bahut daraa hua tha
 When the couple reached Modi to seek his blessings, they were stunned by his reaction
 modi ne apni jeb se ek chocolate nikaali or bole, ‘‘aparaadh-bodh main mat raho
 You have not committed any sin
 ’’ubhaar kaa daurmodi ne 22 se 25 saal kii avasthaa ke bich aresas se sambhddha sanghathanon main or jila prachaarak ke taur par kaam kiya
 The turning point came when Indira Gandhi imposed Emergency in 1975
 is dauraan modi aresas ke ahm ranneetikaar ke taur par aage aae
 He kept helping underground anti-congress forces for several months
 un dinon ve aresas kaa diya hua ek lambretta scooter chalaate the or kai logon ko ab bhi yaad he ki us samay jansangh ke netaa shankarasingh waghela unke peeche baitha karte the, jo ab gujarat main congress ke bade netaa hai
 Modi's next contribution came in the form of helping the victims of the devastation of the Morvi dam in 1979
 jab unhone baandh ke tuutane kii khabar suni tab ve chennai main the
 He reached the spot within 12 hours and was instrumental in forming a trust to help the families of the victims
 uske baad se modi ke maatahat kaam karne vaale parendu bachubhai bhagat bataate hai, ‘‘morvi cond ke peediton kii madad karne ke liye aresas ko jodgaye main unke netritv ne apaat sthitiyon main ek acha sanghathankarta hone kii unki chhavi ko or bal pradaan kiya
 Modi was sent to the Gujarat BJP in 1986 as Organization Secretary
 ayodhya ram mandir andolan ke liye rajya main unhone ahm ranneetikaar kii bhoomika adaa kii
 During that time there was a drought in the state between 1987-89 and there was a lot of dissatisfaction with the relief work of the state government
 us samay modi ne waghela ke saath milakar sookhaa peediton ke liye insaaf dilaane kii khatir nyaay yatra nikaali
 By that time, Modi was in the news as an emerging leader
 phir unhone 1989 ke loksabhaa chunaav or 1990 ke rajya vidhansabha chunaav main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 bjp's credible performance in both elections firmly established him as an important political and electoral strategist
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki unhen 1991 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke liye bijepi kii 11 sadasyeey rashtriya chunaav samiti kaa sadsy bana diya gaya
 Modi visited the US at least four times between 1990 and 2000
 vahaan unhone apravasi bharatiyon ke bich apni paith banaai
 He spent time at the home of Kanchan Banerjee, an immigrant Indian who was a technician in Boston
 unke ghar par modi ne kai baar bhojan kiya
 Regarding Modi's love for state-of-the-art equipment, Banerjee says, "once my family pressured him to get a gift from us, he hesitantly asked for a modern laptop
" us aadhunik sanskaran kaa istemaal ham bhi tab nahin kar rahe the
 We are surprised to know that they are so familiar with modern technology
 ’’baahar kathor, bheetar naramkaam karne or karwaane ke maamle main behad kathor hone ke baavjood modi kaa naram paksh is baat main dikhataa he ki ve nijee vyavhaar ke maheen se maheen bindu ko bhi dekh pate hai
 Just after the Vibrant Gujarat summit held in Ahmedabad in 2007, a colleague told Modi that Arvind Mills' decision to put Sanjay Lalbhai in the front row on the dais was wrong as he is a highly respected industrialist and his grandfather Kasturbhai Lalbhai was a liberal philanthropist
 modi ke pradhan sachiv ke
 Kailashanathan immediately sent a letter of apology to Lalbhai
 modi ke is kadam se lalbhai ko sukhad aashcharya hua
 If one wants to understand Modi's philosophy deeply, one can see his poetry collections, Aankhon Blessed and Witness, in which Modi has inserted excerpts from his diary written in the 1970s when he was not yet in politics
 modi kaa ek nirmam or kathor paksh bhi he jo is hakeekat main dikhaai detaa he ki kaise unhone apni party ke bheetar apane saare virodhiyon ko kuchal daalaa-pehle gujarat main, jahaan ve keshubhai patel or aresas ke apane purv sahyogi sanjay joshi ke saath vivaadon main uljhe or phir rashtriya str par, jab bijepi ke pratikul rashtriya netritv ko darkinar karte hue 2013 main ve party ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke rup main ubhar kar saamne aae
 Now it is Modi's time, so many speculations will be made about his inspirations and his sources and his interpretations will be done
 ve chaahe jo bhi hon, lekin is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki 2014 main khabaron main chhaae rahane vaale is shaks ne khud itnaa saadhaaran jivan jiya he ki yah apane aap main kam asaadhaaran baat nahin he
 Kochi Tuskers Kerala captain Mahela Jayawardene, who recorded a third win in the IPL, said that the team is showing good solidarity and this is the key to their success
 eden gardens main buudhvaar ko khele gaye ipel match main kochi ne kolkata niterdirs ko chah ran se haraa diya
 The special thing is that Kochi started the season with two defeats, but after that the team defeated teams like defending champions Chennai Super Kings, Mumbai Indians and Kolkata Knight Riders

 iske opening de kaa collection bhi saamne aa gaya he

 The film is receiving mixed reviews
 jo bhi film dekhakar aa rahaa he wo ye kah rahaa he ki film main sirf kangana hi kangana najar aa rahi hai
 The film's co-director Krrish shared his experiences of working with Kangana in the film
 saath hi unhone sonu sood ke film chhodane kii vajah kaa bhi khulaasa kiya he
 During an interview, Krrish said that when the film was ready, Kangana had objections to some scenes in the film
 unhen baaki kirdaaron ke seens zyada lag rahe the
 He said to reshoot some scenes
 film ke produsar camel jain bhi kangana ke saath the
 i agreed to shoot again and i planned with Prasun Joshi
 is dauraan kangan ne achaanak se kaha ki sonu ke kairactor ko interval main maranaa hoga
 While it was completely against history
 manikarnika: diarector bole- sab khud karnaa chaahati thim kangana, katwa die sabake sinabakaul krish, "main is baat se sahamat nahin hua
 Sonu was playing an important character in the film
 film main ve sadashiv ke role main the
 He shot the character beautifully for 35 days
 itahaas ke hisaab se sadashiv ko film main lakshmibai se kuch samay pehle hi maranaa tha magar kangana kii jid is role ko interval main maarane kii thi
 Kamal was also with Kangana
 magar sonu ko ye baat pachi nahin or unhone film main aage kaam karne se manaa kar diya
 When there was opposition from my side for molesting history, Kangana and Kamal said that it should be what is good for the film
 "manikarnika Box office Collection Day 1: kangana kii 'manikarnika' ne kii sadhi shuruyaat, pehle din kamaaye itane karodabata den ki sonu ke baahar nikalne par us dauraan kangana ne kaha tha ki sonu ek mahila nirdeshak kaa hukum nahin maananaa chaahate hai
 But Krrish said on this - it is wrong, it did not happen
 jo kangana ne kaha wo sahi nahin he
 i do not blame Sonu for exiting the film
 pehle film main sonu kaa ran time 100 minute kaa tha joki baad main gata kar 60 minute kaa kar diya gaya
 Who would want to work in such a situation? koi bhi nahin karegaa

 Breathing a sigh of relief after winning the second ODI against the hosts England in a Test series after a crushing defeat, Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni called the 50-over format good for returning to form
 cardiff main khele gaye barish se prabhavit match main dakworth louis paddati kii madad se bharat ko 133 ran se mili jeet ke baad dhoni ne kaha, agle teen maichon main england kii team kii tulana main hamen adhik samarthan milegaa
 You cannot play one dimensional cricket
 yah form main vaapasi karne ke liye acha praaroop he
 India, batting first after losing the toss, recovered from the initial setback to score 304 for six, including an unbeaten 100-run knock by Suresh Raina
 iske jawaab main england kii team dakworth louis paddati se 295 ran ke lakshya kaa peechha karte hue 161 ran par ol out ho gai
 Dhoni said, the beginning is important
 pehle 10 over main ham apekshit ran nahin bana paae, lekin ham jaanate the ki yadi 30 over ke baad ham ek acchhee saajhedaari nibhaa dete hai to phir score doguna kar sakate hai
 It is notable that the rain came soon after the Indian innings and Dhoni said that his team benefited from it
 unhone kaha, barish aane se hamaare spinneron ko madad mili
 Ravindra Jadeja showed amazing bowling and took four wickets for 28 runs
 dhoni ne unke bare main kaha, yadi ham pichhali kuch shrunkhalaaon kii baat karen to jab bhi gend halkaa sa turn leti he, tab hamane dekha ki jadeja ke khilaaf ran bananaa aasaan nahin rahaa
 He said, he bowls in the same area and gets little help from the wicket as well, which is the main reason for his success
 iske saath hi jab use pich se madad nahin milti to vah bhi jujhataa he
 He too needs to improve as a bowler
 acchhee baat yah he ki vah sudhaar kar rahaa he or hamaare liye wicket le rahaa he
 He is a useful player in the lower order for us
 vah jab kuch over bache hon, tab teji se ran juta saktaa he
 Talking about playing with five bowlers, Dhoni said, "we have been playing with five bowlers for years in one-day
" jadeja or aswin donon gendbaaji or ballebaaji kar sakate hai
 Raina is also an option, which can do some overs
 yadi ek gendbaaj kaa din nahin hota he to raina paanch yaa chah achche over kar saktaa he
 Having five bowlers ends my problems
 unhone kaha, tej gendbaajon ko ab bhi sudhaar karne kii jarurat he
 He got some help today
 iske alaava vartmaan kii kshetrarakshan kii paabandiyon main unke liye thodaa mushkil ho gaya he
 Overall, the five bowlers are not a problem, as Jadeja and Ashwin are in the XI

 Where is the diamond Where is the diamond? Perhaps Kohinoor will be a pain, then our Hindi cinema has been creating such dialogues about diamonds
 don kii tijori main rakhaa hira ho yaa bank kii tijori main
 Diamond means a safety circle with a variety of wonders
 heere kii chori karte vakt hamaare tamaam nayak computer science main graduate lagate hai
 Algorithm seems to have been discovered by these people
 ve ek ek number par dhire-dhire ungali rakhte jate hai
 Stop for a while at the last number as if you were remembering the PIN number of the ATM
 aakhri number par ungali rakhte hi daravaaza khul jaataa he or hira haath main aa jaataa he
 Since the ban on gold imports was lifted, our film people shifted to diamond theft in the twenty-first century
 logon main heere kaa general nalege bhi bade, iske liye tamaam tijoriyon main hira hameshaa shishe ke bakse main rakhaa gaya yaa phir bakse ke upar kisi stand main jad diya gaya taaki har darshak ko dikh jaae ki wo rahaa hira
 Through all these scenes, Kohinoor cannot claim whether or not it has been part of any of our national glands i
e
 complex, but diamond has always been a stolen item
 tabhi to tamaam filmon main hamaare nayak hira laane kaa kitna jokhim uthaate rahe hai
 They never steal a diamond at the beginning of the film
 pehle puri film main practice karte hai phir jaakar last seen main churaate hai
 Heera and Clamax have a birth-to-date relationship
 dhooma-2 main to apana ruthik roshan plaster aaf paris kii murti ban gaya
 He stood with them in a diamond safe
 mujhe to lagata he ki aajkal hira chori kaa jo set banataa he wo kisi badi building main lift vaala aria hota he jahaan kai darvaaze ek saath khulte or band hote rahete hai
 Fraudulently, the film people show how safe the diamond is
 kitne darvaaze hai
 In Prince, Vivek Oberoi does not know which cloth he wears which suffers 440 volts of current
 ankhen main sushmita sen paresh rawal, arjuna rampal or akshay kumaar ko kitni training detii he
 Paresh Rawal is also a BJP MP
 unhen aage aana chahie or kahana chahie ki maine ek film main heere kii chori kii he
 They too can close their eyes and bring the Kohinoor if the government permits
 happy new year main shahrukh khan duniya ke logon ko do bhaagon main baant dete hai
 It is said that there are two types of people in the world
 ek vinar or ek luzar
 It was a new item in the ever-dividing market of the rich and the poor, which changed the whole discourse
 magar hira chori karne saare log landan nahin jate hai
 i would like to practice in Dubai before i think whether or not we can steal from here
 baad main ham kohinoor sochenge
 King Khan says that life gives every loser an opportunity to become a winner
 kasam se unke is samvaad ne mujhe pehle qaayal kiya phir ghayal kar diya tha
 Kohinoor will come
 zindagi hamen ek mauka degi use laane kaa
 With this hope, i returned home from the cinema
 aurangzeb ke naam se ham road tak bardaasht nahin kar sakate lekin babar ke haath se sparsh hue kohinoor ke liye itane betaab ho sakate hai, samaj nahin aayaa
 What is less, the fools have not yet declared those people as traitors in the name of nationalism, who gave the eyes of Noor Kohinoor to the British as a gift
 kohinoor ham hindustaniyon ko luzar se vinar banane ke mauqe kaa naam he
 In the name of bringing it, village-by-street, the garbage of history continues to spread the wonders of wonder
 jaise hi pataa chalaa ki november 2015 main pradhanmantri narendra modi landan jane vaale hai hindi channelon ne kohinoor heere ko lekar hangaamaa khadaa kar diya
 Public dream was created about Kohinoor that this is the diamond
 gaur se dekho, ankhen fadkar dekho
 Modi ji is about to come
 channelon ne ek chaalaaki kii
 Whenever written, with the questioning symbol written, Modi can ask the Queen for Kohinoor? Will Modi demand Kohinoor diamond during lunch with Queen? Clipping of these channels on youtube shows that a significant propaganda has been created
 unki baton se aisa laga jaise piem modi lunch ke dauraan yah kehane vaale hon ki madam wo jo hira rakhaa he aapke bagal main, agar mil jaataa to
 
 
 Not me, our country channels are asking
 
 
 agar
 
 
 No problem otherwise
 
 
 
 
 ‘aisa pataa chalaa he’ ke aadhaar par koob khabaren chali
 No one has revealed to whom it is revealed
 aisa pataa chalaa he jaise jangal-jangal baat chali he pataa chalaa he
 It makes me sound like this
 udhar se uttar pradesh se aazam khan bayaan dene lage ki pradhanmantri kohinoor to laayen hi saath main landan se tipu sultan kii wo anguthi bhi lete aaen jis par ram likhaa he
 Something would have taken care of the status of Azam Saheb too
 johari kii dukaan main nahin gaye the hamaare piem ki heere ke saath ek anguthi bhi maang lete
 No one knows if there was a demand for diamonds
 tippaniyan There are some blanks of Indian nationalism which our politics keeps frustrating in the hope that we will be filled sometime
 jab tak nahin bharenge hamaara rashtrawaad puraa nahin hoga
 From the Parliament to the road, Kohinoor has also been presented as a vacant place to be filled from London
 magar hai
 What did the government do? koi lut kar nahin le gaya to yahi kah dete ki chori kar le gaya tha
 It was also a matter of saying that we have given gifts
 kohinoor ko lekar sara excitement hi khatm kar diya modi sarkaar ne
 When Modi was on a visit to London, the British Prime Minister told NDTV that we will not give Kohinoor
 aise to hamaare musium hi khaali ho jaaenge
 Talk to the same thing, Solicitor General of India Ranjit Kumar has said in the Supreme Court that if we do this then our museum will be empty
 jaao o duniya waalon, hamane musium kii khaatir mulk kaa sapana qurbaan kar diya
 But the Supreme Court still has the last hope, so the court did not dismiss the case so that if someone makes a claim in future, it will not be difficult that your court has rejected it
 yani supreme court ne us sapane ko zindaa rakhaa he
