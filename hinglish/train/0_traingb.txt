 salmaan khan ko kaala hiran shikaar maamle main mili jamaanat ke baad bollywood jagat or se phens behad khush hai
 As soon as Salman got bail on Saturday, fans from Jodhpur to Mumbai performed fireworks and distributed sweets
 lekin is khabar se actress or eks big bos contestant sophia hayaat kaaphi dukhi hai
 Katrina came to meet Salman as soon as she came home, these stars also came
 nazarsofia posted a picture of Indian currency on social media posting against Salman Khan
 iske saath unhone likhaa ki in jaruri kagajaton ko jamaa karne ke baad salmaan ko jamaanat mili he
 If everyone has such papers, there is no need to go to court
 salmaan ne is baat ko sabit kar diya he ki hindustan main nyaay se zyada bhrashtachar failaa hua he
 The important papers submitted by Salman Khans lawyers to get him bail
 Ahh
 
 if everyone had these kind of papers
 
 there would be no need for court systems or judges or even a justice system! Well done India!! You have proved that corruption in India is far stronger than any sort of justice
 So 
 inject yourself with steroids, teach the young its ok to kill animals and people and abuse women
 
 throw a few dance moves in pants that are far too tight
 
 
 
 and as long as you have these documents
 
 you are king in India! They say Tiger Zinda hai
 
 but in reality it is an endagered species
 
 
 soon to be extinct 
 
 let the real hearts rise
 
 i am so sorry to all of you who actually had hope in the Indian Justice system
 
 Keep fighting for the truth
 
 because the truth prevails in the end
 Namaste Shalom salaam

 After the incident, Salman had delivered the weapon to Mumbai, this is how disclosure happened
 On Thursday, Sofia expressed happiness after Salman Khan was sentenced
 unhone likhaa tha ki actor kii ek tasviir share kii he
 In which guilty is written
 saath hi being human main se beeing katkar no more human likhaa he
 Karma gets you in the end
 
 
 Many people are afraid to talk against Salman because they think he controls Bollywood
 Well, i no longer serve my ego and therefore am not afraid to speak up
 i am so happy that Salman has gone to jail for what he has done
 Animals are so important to this planet and doing what he did and then mocking it was a huge act of his own self importance
 Lots of children look up to him, and he has a responsibility to the young people
 What is he showing the world when he does things like this? What lessons is he giving them? That it is ok to break the law, to kill animals and then mock it because he is a celebrity? In any western country he would have been vilified for this and the drink driving deaths that he caused
 He has then reinvented himself as a charitable man to try and compensate his karma
 Today, India has shown that no matter who you are, if you break the law, you are no bigger than the law
 i have heard so many young people in India speak about how they are afraid to go to the police about crimes committed by others because they watch the tv and see how people with money and status get away with it because they have paid off the police or the judge or the lawyers
 This happened to me when Armaan Kohli paid off 2 of my lawyers so that i could not continue with the case, Dolly Bindra also told me that Armaans family are powerful enough to put drugs in my bag at the airport and i would be in Jail
 i had to then drop the case as all the lawyers i hired were paid off
 Today, Hindustan can stand strong and hold its head up high to the world and show them that justice is held up in India, and today, all the poor people have been shown a glimmer of hope in their own fight for justice against those who have manipulated the law
 Today i can say Hindustaan zindabaad!a post shared bysofia Hayat(@sofiahayat) onapr 5, 2018 at 10:40am pdtpoto main likhaa- aakhir main aapako karmon kaa fal miltaa he
 Many people are afraid to speak against Salman, because they think Salman controls Bollywood
 lekin main kisi se nahin darati hum
 i am happy that Salman had to go to jail for what he did
 bataa den, bhartiya mul kii british model or actress sophia hayaat ne 2013 main big bos-7 main hissaa liya tha
 She also had an argument with Salman Khan on the show

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi apane daure ke duusare din shanivaar ko sagar or damoh main chunavi jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue piem modi or shivaraj sarkaar par jamkar hamalaa kiya
 Addressing the rally at Damoh, Rahul said, 'there is a difference between Modi and Shivraj
 shivaraj ji tameez se bolte hai or narendra modi ji tameez se bolnaa nahin jaanate hai
 It is sad that he is the Prime Minister of the country, he has been elected by the people of the country, but i will not utter a single word against him wrong
 'bhrashtachar kiya lekin vikaas nahinunhone kaha ki shivaraj akraman karte hai, lekin vah tameez se bolte hai
 Narendra Modi does not know how to speak from Tamizh
 dukh kii baat he
 He is the Prime Minister of the country, but Rahul Gandhi will never speak abusively about him
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki shivaraj ji se ham lard rahe hai khulkar or bhayankar ladaai ho rahi he
 But he is speaking from the tameez
 fark he donon main
 You will say that Rahul Gandhi is praising the Chief Minister, but if the truth is there, we will have to speak
 bhrashtachar jarur kiya he par unhone vikaas nahin kiya, lekin vyakti tameez se baat karata he
 Rahul Gandhi said that Shivraj ruled for 15 years, there are drawbacks
 galtiyaan to kii hai
 The Shivraj government has deteriorated like a burnt pan
 aise main ab ek hi rasta bachaa he
 The old pan is to be lifted by hand and thrown out
 rahul ne kaha ki ab piem ke bhaashan main na kisaanon kii baat hoti he, na yuvaaon ke rojgaar kii baat hoti or na hi bhrashtachar kii baat
 Now let's talk about hate
 gusse main baat karte hai or jhooth main bolte hai
 The reason for this is that Narendra Modi knows that the confidence farmers had of the youth is broken
 ab jab modi ke bhaashan janata sunati he to unki taraf dekhati he to kahati dekho ye jhooth bolne aayaa he
 If Modi understands his mind, he starts calling our family and party bad
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha ki vyapam ghotaale kaa puraa phayda aresas ke logon or shivaraj singh chouhan ke parivaar ko mila he
 Rahul said, 'when i mistakenly took the name of Shivraj Chauhan's son in the Panama Papers, then immediately filed a defamation case, but when i took his name in Vyapam, Dumper scandal, e-tendering, why not file a defamation case Made? In stealing BJP CM Jutarahul said that in every state, the Chief Minister of BJP is busy in stealing something
 rajasthan kii mukhyamantri ke bete ne lalit modi se paisa liya, chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri ke bete kaa naam panama paper main aayaa to yahaan shivaraj chouhan vyapam, danpar cond or i-tendering main he
 Rahul Gandhi said that a woman told our party worker that the kitchen is spoiled in 10 years
 us par pakaayi roti jal jaati he
 Similarly, the government of Shivraj Singh Chauhan has been spoiled like Tawa
 ab haath se tave ko uthankar baahar phenkna he

 In this episode, on Friday, he targeted PM Narendra Modi and CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan by holding public meetings in Vidisha, Raisen and Sehore
 raisen main chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue rahul ne kaha tha ki ab modi bhaashan karte hai to janata yun dekhati he ki meeting kab khatm hogi
 Rahul said that the biggest scam is demonetisation
 yadi notebandi kaale dhan ke khilaaf ladaai thi to line main sirf kisaan, majdoor or chote vyapaaree kyon dikhe, suut-boot vaale kyon nahin dikhe
 Rahul said that Modi 3
 5 lakh karod rupye maaf kar die
 It takes 35 thousand crore rupees a year to run MNREGA
 aise 10 manaregaa ke liye unhone 15 logon ke 3
 5 lakh crores waived
 rajya ke yuva khaskar yahaan is vidhansabha kshetra ke yuva kehete hai ki modi ji yahaan hamaari industry band ho gai jo pehle tha wo khatm ho gai, rojgaar khatm ho gaye
 There is no answer to how much money you put here
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki vah pradhanmantri narendra modi se milane unke offis gaye or unhone kisaanon kii karjamaafee kii baat kahi to pradhanmantri ne kuch nahin bolaa

 In Karnataka, the opposition on the coronation of BS Yeddyurappa has been badly fueled by the opposition
 congress jahaan sadak par hallaa bol ke liye utari he vahiin guuruuvaar ko basapa pramukh mayawati ne bijepi par bada hamalaa bolaa he
 Mayawati said that ever since the BJP came to power, it has been destroying the constitution made by Baba Saheb
 bijepi sarkari mashinari kaa durupyog karke loktantr par hamalaa kar rahi he
 Let me tell you that in the Karnataka Assembly elections, BSP fought an alliance with JDS
 basapa ek seat jeetne main safal rahi he
 No party has got a majority in the state's election results
 bijepi ko 104, congress ko 78, jedies ko 37, basapa ko 1 or 2 siten anya ko mili he
 The Congress and JDS joined hands to form the government after the election results, but the Governor invited the BJP to form the government

 After the death of newborns in the Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad, once again the debate on the issue of malnutrition has erupted
 bahes main gujarat sarkaar par kotahi baratane ke gambhir arol lag rahe hai
 When 'aaj Tak' team tried to find out how Gujarat is performing in comparison to other states in terms of necromancy, there were quite shocking cases
 khaskar ucch madhyam or nichle tabake ke sabhi log kahin naa kahin kuposhan kaa shikaar hai
 Dr
 Jayesh Shah, research consultant at the Center for Culture and Development in Vadodara, said, "it is not the case that malnutrition is found only in tribal areas
 urban ilaake main bhi yah kaaphi gambhir samasya he
 For this, we will need to change the Food Habit

 The death rate of such children is also estimated at 45 percent

 To tackle the problem of malnutrition in cities and villages in Gujarat, the government has built big buildings but there are no staff
 matlab sarkaar hardware bana rahi he magar unako softver kii ahmiyat pataa hi nahin he
 "malnutrition on the basis of income: Upper Income Group - 30% Middle Income Group - 45% Low Income Group - 60% Malnutrition Based Caste - 45% Scheduled Castes - 45% Other Backward Classes - 42% Savarnas - 32% Now Income and Dr
 Jayesh Shah's revision on caste-based figures is noted
 dow jyesh shah ke mutabik, "gujarat sarkaar jo paise kharch karti he wo kuposhan kii samasya se jujhane ke liye kaaphi kam he
 In such a situation, with the help of various ngos and effective people, you will have to speak up for the elimination of this problem, only then Gujarat will be empowered
 " Just think, one day you wake up and see that the response to your fan-mail has come, then how will that day be for you

 Bajpai said that the aim of the campaign was to make the passengers aware of the rules about carrying maximum luggage
 (input bhashaa se) Hello, Ravish Kumar
 do logon ke dilli lautne kaa intazaar ho rahaa he
 Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal
 arvind is vakt chup hai magar unki audio ricarding bahut kuch bol rahi he
 We cannot prove the authenticity of the audio recording, but the leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party itself have proved the things said in it
 vaise main sting ko lekar vyaktigat str par bahut utsahit nahin rahata
 But on social media many people requested in abusive language, it seemed that there could be a decent debate
 is ghanghor ghamaasan ke bich soshal media main aap ke samarthak jis tanaav se guzar rahe hai unhen bengalooru janaa chahie
 It should be seen how their leaders are in a state of meditation and yoga in a state of balance and harmony
 ummid he is mudra main aapke sawaalon ke jawaab hi soch rahe honge
 Allegedly speaking on his voice in the audio CD is made
 vaise hamaari raajnneeti main aise netaa bhi hue hai jo kuch masalon par jawaab nahin dete hai or intervyuu se pehle sawaal likhva lete hai
 Many such leaders have been silent for the last ten and twelve years
 lekin nai or khuli raajnneeti kaa daawa karne vaale arvind kejariwal bhi agar nahin bolenge to phir yahi hoga ki ve jin par sawaal uthaate rahe hai unhen bhi sant ghoshit kar dena padegaa
 Our leaders are saints
 aise tanaav ke vakt unka maun dekhakar un samarthakon ko cartoon channel dekhne lag janaa chahie jo har vakt twitor par tanaav ke haadase se guzarate rahete hai
 From Arvind's picture, which is seen as satvikta, it seems that nothing is spoiled
 audio sidi kaa jitna hissaa public main aayaa he usamen paise yaa pad ke len-dein kii baat nahin he
 But the attempt to contact the mlas of a party is re-alignment, not manipulative, it is not digested
 agar bijepi aam aadmi party ke vidhayakon se sampark karne lage to kya ise jod-tod kaha jayega yaa polytical ri-allinement
 Will Ashish Khaitan still say that this has been happening, is happening and will happen
 jaisaa ki unhone sidi ke sandarbh main kaha he
 We believe that political re-alignment has been, is and will continue to happen
 polytical ri-allinement jod-tod nahin he
 The tape does not show at all that we gained the support of Congress in an unethical manner
 congress ke ve vidhayak hamaare vidhayak ke sampark main the or yah dilli ke hit main tha ki sarkaar bane
 At that time the BJP was also trying to form a government with horse-trading
 pramanikta kaa ek masalaa to he
 Whether the address was brought to the fore, but Kumar Vishwas has admitted that the audio CD was given to him by Rajesh Garg which he gave to senior party leaders
 kis netaa ko diya tha ye nahin bataaya
 Was the party's Lokpal given that CD? kya tab party ne forecinc jaanch yaa exiaar kii
 It is true that if Rajesh Garg leaked during the election, there would have been more than the ruckus that is happening today, but the question is not of time but of things which are applicable all the time
 ab kuch puraane ghatnakramon ko sajaate hai
 On 20 May 2014, Hindu newspaper headline Arvind Kejriwal sought a week's time from Lieutenant Governor to take opinion of the people of Delhi and explore possibilities of forming a government
 usee din pradesh congress ke adhyaksh arvinder singh lavali kaa bayaan he ki congress aap kaa samarthan nahin karegi
 The party wants elections
 10 june ke mail online or 11 june ke india today kii khabar bataati he ki aam aadmi party ke vidhayak rajesh garg ne party kii line se alag jaakar congress ke vidhayakon se apil kii he ve sarkaar banane main aam aadmi party kaa samarthan karen
 Garg Saheb appealed and is now alleging horse-trading
 is maamle main arvind kejariwal ne kai baar line badali or sawaal bhi uthe the
 During this, some AAP mlas also alleged that the BJP is trying to buy by giving money and the temptation of the post
 bijepi ne inkaar kar diya tha
 Arvind Kejriwal told the mlas that he might have a sting to defame the party, but did not say that it has become Kejriwal himself
 3 july ko aam aadmi party raashtrapati se milakar tazaa chunaav kii maang karti he
 On July 4, the Supreme Court sent Arvind Kejriwal's petition to the constitutional bench
 arvind ne vidhansabha bhang kar chunaav karne kii maang kii thi
 In the Indian Express news of July 19, Congress mlas Asif Khan and Hasan Ahmed admitted that the Congress was talking to the Aam Aadmi Party to form the government
 kuch congress netaaon ne kaha tha ki agar kharid-farokht ke aarope nahin lagaati to baatcheet ho gai thi
 On 21 July, Arvind Kejriwal meets the Lt
 Governor and talks of early elections to stop horse-trading
 audio sidi ko samajhane ke liye akhabaaron ke puraane kataranon ko saamne rakhana chahie taaki polytical ri-allinement ke ashish khetaneey siddhant par thik se charchaa ho sake
 At that time, the Congress was publicly talking about elections, but its legislators said that the party is forming the government by meeting the AAP
 us vakt aam aadmi party chunaav kii baat kar rahi thi or bheetar bheetar congress ke vidhayakon se sampark kar rahi thi
 BJP was also claiming to form the government
 ab yah to mukhyamantri arvind par hi nirbhar karata he ki ve dhyaan mudra se baahar aakar kaise jawaab dete hai
 The Congress was being negotiated at the party level or the legislators at the personal level
 donon main antar he
 Political re-alignment takes place at the party level or by bursting the individual MLA
 agar hota he to jod tod kise kahenge
 In the alleged audio CD, Arvind is allegedly telling Rajesh Garg that i should tell you, you should start getting these 6 separated
 6 log alag karke, apni party banaake hamen baahar se samarthan kar den
 In this CD, Arvind is talking about three Muslims
 kai party ke netaa or ham patrkaar jaankaar bhi apane lekhon main muslim netaaon ke bare main aisa kehete hai
 But what would the leaders of the party, who turned out to be brave by publicly rejecting Imam Bukhari's appeal, say in a closed room if an MLA hopes to be a Muslim
 prime time main baat karenge
 Meanwhile the insurance bill has passed
 is bich bahut kuch ho gaya he lekin isi bich yah sawaal sabko pareshaan kar rahaa he jise nayaa samajha tha wo kahin puraane jaisaa to nahin he

 What will change for Muslim women when the triple talaq bill comes into force, the bill to declare three talaqs and punish them was passed in the Lok Sabha on Thursday after a long six-hour debate
 bill kaa naam ‘da muslim vimen protection of ritis in marij act' he
 Triple divorce has now been made a punishable offense under this bill without any amendment
 rajyasabha main paarit hone or raashtrapati kii manjuuri ke baad ye kanoon kaa shakl akhriyaar kar legaa
 In such a situation, everyone is interested in what the effect will be
 muslim mahilaon ko ab agar koi teen talaak detaa he, to kya vikalp honge or unke liye isse kya kuch badalegaa

 film industry ke 'tragedy king' dilip kumaar kaa aaj janmdin he
 His performances range from the century superstar Amitabh Bachchan to Shah Rukh Khan
 aaie jaane bi toun ke is ligendry actor ke bare main kuch khaas baaten-1
 Dilip Kumar was born on 11 December 1922 in Peshawar (now Pakistan)
 janm ke vakt inkaa naam mohammad yusuf khan rakhaa gaya tha
 2
 dilip kumaar ke pita lala gulam sarwar falon ke vyapaaree the or 1930 main inkaa puraa parivaar mumbai shift ho gaya tha
 3
 saal 1940 mendilip kumaarane mumbai kaa ghar chhod diya, or pune jaakar ek army club ke paas 'sandwich stall' lagaaya
 Dileep returned to Mumbai after the contract was over after collecting about Rs 5000
 4
 On coming to Mumbai, Dilip Kumar met Doctor Masani near Churchgate station, and Masani gave him a chance to work in 'bombay Talkies'
 jahaan dilip kumaar us jamaane kii mashhoor abhinetri 'devika rani' se bhi mili, jo 'bombai takies' kii malkin bhi thim
 In Bombay Talkies, Dilip Kumar started working on a salary of Rs 1250 a month, while Dilip Kumar met the famous actor of that time, Ashok Kumar, and the two developed a good friendship
 5
 Dilip Kumar used to help in scripts and screenplays in 'bombay Talkies' because of his knowledge of Urdu language
 devika rani ne hi inkaa naam 'usoof' se badalakar 'dilip kumaar' rakhaa tha
 6
 saal 1944 main dilip kumaar ko 'jowar bhaata' film main lead role mila, jahaan se 'tragedy king' ke acting kariyar kii shuruyaat hui
 The film 'jawar Bhata' did not do much at the box office, but the film 'jugnu', which came out in 1947 with the actress 'noor Jahan', did well at the box office and people came to know the name of Dilip Kumar
 iske baad dilip ne raaj kapur ke saath mehboob khan kii 'andaaj' film kii, jise kaaphi saraahaa gaya
 7
 dilip kumaar ne us jamaane kii ek se badhkar ek heroinon minaa kumari, madhubala, kamini kaushal, vaijantimala, nimmi, or nargis ke saath kai filmein kii
 Famous films of 'tragedy King' include 'mughal e Azam', 'madhumati', 'devdas', 'ganga-jamuna', 'jew', 'musafir', 'naya Daur', 'leader', 'ram and Shyam' , 'revolution' etc
 8
 There is also a 'guinness Book of World Record' for the highest award by an Indian actor in the name of Dilip Kumar
 inhen 'padam bhushan' or 'dada sahab phalke' award se bhi sammanit kiya ja chukaa he
 9
 khabaron ke mutabik dilip kumaar ko us jamaane main kamini kaushal se prem hua, lekin kisi vajah se shaadi nahin ho pai, phir madhubala ke saath bhi mohabbat kii khabaren ain, par gharavaalon kii rajamandi naa hone kii vajah se shaadi nahin ho pai
 Dilip Kumar's name was also associated with Vaijantimala, but both of them called it a rumor
 saal 1966 main dilip kumaar ne 22 saal choti actress 'syra bano' se shaadi rachaai, uske baad 1980 main dilip kumaar ne 'aasamaa' se doosraa byaah rachaaya, par yah shaadi zyada dinon tak tik nahin pai
 These days, Dilip Kumar lives in his bungalow in Mumbai's Bandra area along with Baysayra Banoke
 10
 According to Saira Banu- 'dilip Kumar used to be very fond of omelette, used to eat many omelets at once, and Raj Kapoor and Dev Anand also used to eat fiercely with him
 sansad main sadan ke bheetar satta paksh or vipaksh ke netaaon main nok-jhonk or tikhi bahes to kai baar dekhne ko milti he, lekin aisa kabhi-kabhaar hi hota he ki vipaksh kaa koi sadsy kisi mantri ke liye chocolate bhijwaaye
 Today a similar view was seen within the Rajya Sabha
 samaajawaadee party kii saansad jaya bachchan ne rajyasabha main shoonyakaal ke dauraan yah maamla uthaaya kii sarkaar digital iconomi or cashles pement kii baat to khub kar rahi he, lekin use pukhta karne ke liye jaruri kadam nahin uthaa rahi he
 Jaya Bachchan said that demonetisation was a step taken without preparation, which caused a lot of trouble to the people
 lekin us vakt kaha gaya ki isse cashles iknomi banane main madad milegi
 Jaya Bachchan said that the government talks about digital payments, but the necessary resources are not being provided for it
 dukandaaron ko card se pement sweekaar karne ke liye point of cell (POS) mashin milane main behad mushkil aa rahi he
 He said that 20 lakh point of sale machines are needed in the country, while only 1
5 million machines are available
 dukandaar chaah kar bhi yah mashin nahin kharid paa rahe hai
 On the other hand, banks are charging a hefty fee in lieu of payment from the card, the burden of which is on the shopkeepers
 unka kahana tha ki agar sarkaar sachmuch digital pement ko badhaava dena chaahati he, to use chahie ki card pement par shulk kam kiya jaae
 He said that the government has started such a service from Bheem app to Aadhaar based payment and UPI, that there is confusion and confusion among people about it
 iskaa nateeja yah he ki digital pement karne vaale logon kii sankhya to bad rahi he lekin lenden kii raashi ghatati ja rahi he
 Jaya Bachchan also raised the question that the kind of training that people need to be given to create a digital economy is not available
 jawaab dene ke liye iti mantriravishankar prasad uthe
 He said that the allegation is not correct that the government did not prepare it at all
 ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki ab tak do karod se zyada log bhim ap downlod kar chuke hai or isse 1500 karod rupee kaa len-dein ho chukaa he
 But he accepted that the suggestions made by Jaya Bachchan are worth considering and the government will consider them
 ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki sarkaar digital pement ko lekar aa rahi dikkaton ko dur karne ke liye kadam uthaaegi
 When Ravi Shankar Prasad sat down, Jaya Bachchan took the chocolate out of her purse and wrapped it in a paper and sent it to Ravi Shankar Prasad
 ravishankar prasad ne muskuraate hue is gift ko sweekaar kar liya
 There has been an uproar on social media since the Citizenship Amendment Bill 2019 was passed in the Rajya Sabha, and celebrities who have always voiced current issues on social media are raising their voice against the CAB as well
 bollywood actress richa chaddha (richa Chadha) lagaataar twit kar rahi hai or apane riection de rahi hai

 They expect people to act wisely
 'loksabhaa ke baad rajyasabha main bhi naagarikta sanshodhan bill (CAB) paarit ho chukaa he
 125 votes were cast in favor of the bill while 99 members voted against it
 shivasena ne voting ke dauraan rajyasabha se walkout kiya
 The bill provides for Indian citizenship to people from Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who came to India due to religious persecution from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan
 naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak (cab) ko sansad dwaara manjuuri pradaan kiye jane ke bich ise lekar jari virodh pradarshnon ke maddenjar assam ke guwahati or dibrugarh main buudhvaar ko anischikaal ke liye karfu laga diya gaya
 The Army has been called in Guwahati and Jorhat in Assam, while Assam Rifles personnel have been deployed in Tripura
 adhikariyon ne yah jaankaree di
 On the other hand, protesters pelted stones at Dibrugarh house of Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal
 iske alaava assam ke hi duliajan main pradarshnakariyon ne kendriya mantri rameshwar taili ke ghar par hamalaa kiya or sampattiyon ko kshatigrast kar diya
 The Parliament on Wednesday approved the Bill amid widespread protests in the northeastern states, including Assam, over the Garrity Amendment Bill (CAB)
 rajyasabha ne buudhvaar ko vistrut charchaa ke baad is vidheyak ko paarit kar diya
 The House rejected the opposition's proposal and amendments to send the bill to the Select Committee
 vidheyak ke paksh main 125 mat pade jabaki 99 sadasyon ne iske khilaaf matdaan kiya
 As always, this time too the government claims are proving to be hollow
 maamla dilli kii AAP sarkaar kaa he
 The helpline numbers were issued by the AAP government of Delhi on 19 February to reduce the fear of swine flu in public
 lekin in par sampark karnaa tedi kheer he
 This situation is when more than 700 people have died due to swine flu across the country
 madad kisi kaam kii nahinswine flu kii jaankaree dene ke liye dilli sarkaar ne do helpline number 1800-114-377 or 011-22307145 jari kiye the lekin un par lagaataar vyast tone praapt ho rahi he
 Although the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has also issued a helpline number 011-23921401, you can get some information here
 badhata ja rahaa maut kaa aankadadeshbhar main swine flu ke kaaran hone vaali maut kaa aankada saat sau ke paar pahunch gaya he
 The number of people infected has also increased to more than eleven thousand
 sabase zyada prabhavit rajyon main rajasthan, gujarat or madhyapradesh shaamil he lekin ab is sankraman ne mizoram tak ko giraft main le liya he
 Name: Mahabali singhparty: Janta Dal (united) Candidate: Chanpurpita: Nageshwar Singh Age: 60 years old: Agriculture: 8th pass in 2005, 2009 and 2014 election affidavit
 2015 bihar chunaav affidavit main saal 1973 main 10veen paas bharaa
 The journey so far: Mahabali Singh reached Bihar Legislative Assembly in 2005 by winning the election for the first time on Chainpur seat
 tab wo argedy ke tikat par chunaav main utre the
 In 2009, he reached the Lok Sabha by winning the Karakat seat on JDU ticket
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main karakaat se rashtriya lok samta dal ke upendra kushavaah se haare
 As the dates of the Lok Sabha elections are getting closer, the enthusiasts are also increasing
 maharashtra bhi isse dur nahin he, kyonki centre kii gaddi tak pahunchane main maharashtra (maharashtra) kii mahatvapurn bhoomika rahati he
 Maharashtra is second to Uttar Pradesh in terms of Lok Sabha seats
 yahaan loksabhaa kii kul 48 siten hai
 In such a situation political betting and punishments abound by political parties
 maharashtra main sidhaa muqabla bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan or congress-ensipi (nesanalist congress party)ke bich he
 Let us tell you that elections are to be held in Maharashtra in four phases on April 11, 18, 23 and 29
 aadhikarik aankadon ke anusaar rajya main kul 8,73,29,910 matadaataaon main se 18 se 19 varsh ke 1,19,95,027 matadaata pehali baar matadhikaar kaa prayog karenge
 There are 4,57,01,877 males and 4,16,25,950 females and 2,083 third gender voters among the total voters
 maharashtra or haryana main abhootpurv pradarshan ke baad bijepi ke hausale hausale puri tarah se buland hai or ho bhi kyon na, aakhir bijepi apane jeevankaal kaa sabase sunaharaa daur jo dekh rahi he
 In such a situation, now eyes are on Delhi, what will happen in Delhi, will the government be formed or will elections be held? somvaar ko dilli bijepi adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay ne enditivi india ke saath baatcheet main dilli main chunaav ke sanket dete hue kaha tha ki jis tarah kii tsunami haryana main ai he, uskaa asar aapako dilli main bhi nishchit rup se dikhaai degaa, sankhya ke rup main bhi or vaise bhi
 Though no decision has been taken by the party on this, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear the matter on October 28, in which the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi will tell the court what decision he is taking about Delhi
 siyaasi halkon main charchaa is baat kii he ki dilli ke uparajyapal ne sabase bade dal ke rup main bijepi ko sarkaar banane kaa nyotaa dene ke liye raashtrapati kii raay maangi thi, jis par raashtrapati ne koi raay die bina file lautaa di
 The formal position on this is not clear yet, perhaps it will be clear in the hearing on October 28
 jahaan tak aam aadmi party kaa sawaal he, to vah aaj bhi bijepi ko lalkaar rahi he or kah rahi ki himmat he to chunaav karaao
 The Aam Aadmi Party is stressing that the BJP in Delhi does not have the Chief Ministerial candidate to contest Arvind Kejriwal, so when elections are held in Delhi, the people of Delhi will vote for the Aam Aadmi Party in the name of Kejriwal
 1
 The biggest strength of BJP is Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in whose name the voter presses the button on lotus and votes are given to BJP
 2
 The BJP is in the form of a strong majority in the country, the government for the first time in Haryana and the first time in Maharashtra for the BJP to become Chief Minister
 lagaataar jeet se sanghathan majboot he or kaaryakartaaon main utsaah kaayam he 3
 madhyam varg main party majboot sthiti main 4
 soshal media par narendra modi or hindutv samarthakon kii badi maujuudagi 2
 siem candidet ghoshit karne laayak koi aisa charchit cheharaa nahin, jo arvind kejariwal ko takkar de sake
 There are many leaders in their respective areas, who are in the race of CM, but they are not of the standard of entire Delhi
 1
 Arvind Kejriwal is the face of the Aam Aadmi Party and the voter presses the broom button in his name
 2
 Kejriwal is the most discussed CM candidate of all state level leaders present in Delhi at this time
 3
 The party has a strong support base among the economically weaker sections 4
 The presence of the party and Kejriwal supporters on social media is quite good 1
 Resigning from the government in Delhi is still the biggest reason for the resentment and resentment of Kejriwal and Aam Aadmi Party in the minds of people
 2
 In the coming days, the MLA or the leader of the party does something that puts the party or Kejriwal in question
 isse party kii saakh aam janata main prabhavit hoti he 3
 madhyam varg main party jahaan pichley vidhansabha chunaav main jabardast lokapriy thi, vahiin ab middle class main hi party kii ghati lokapriyata uske liye chunauti bani hui he, jiskaa nateeja loksabhaa chunaav main dekhne ko mila
 As far as the Congress is concerned, it seemed a few days ago that the Congress could climb a little when the elections are held, but after the results of the Haryana elections, it is now clear that the contest will be directly against the BJP vs
 AAP
 aise main jab dilli main chunaav karana bijepi ke haath main he, vah akalan kar rahi he ki kya chunaav karana hi ekmaatr vikalp rah gaya he yaa phir kuch or bhi ho saktaa he or agar chunaav karaane bhi pade, to kab karana thik rahegaa
 On the other hand, the Aam Aadmi Party is also planning its campaign, because this election is linked to its existence
 bijepi ke liye dilli main sarkaar bananaa izzat kaa sawaal he, kyonki vah pichley 16 saalon se dilli main satta se baahar he
 On the other hand, for the Aam Aadmi Party, it is a question of its existence because if it has the largest support base, it is only in Delhi and if it does not win Delhi, then what will it do
 chaliye intjaar karte hai or dekhte hai ki dilli ke naseeb main koun he, kyonki aane vaale kuch dinon main dilli kaa bhavishya tay ho saktaa he
 The BJP today said that the way the two Union ministers Shashi Tharoor and p Chidambaram are 'insulting' the common man, they would be sacked if they were in any public or private service
 madhyam varg kaa apmaan kiyaparty ke pravaktaa rajeev pratap rudi ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki tharur ne vimaan kii iconami class ko ‘bhed-bakriyon’ kaa darja bataakar or chidambaram ne dilli vaasiyon ko shishtachar or aacharan seekhney kii salaah dekar madhya varg kaa apmaan kiya he
 He said that the UPA government, which came to power in the name of the common man, should answer why it is lagging behind the middle class
 uske do mantri kyon lagaataar madhyavarg kaa apmaan kar rahe hai or karrwai karne kii bajaay sarkaar unhen maaf kyon kar rahi he
 Central Gujarat has special importance in the politics of Gujarat
 agar ye kaha jaae ki rajya kii satta kaa singhaasana madhya gujarat ke jariye tay hota he to galat nahin hoga
 This is the reason why BJP blew its bugle from central Gujarat for the elections this year and now Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi has landed on the land of central Gujarat to conquer the political battle of the state
 khaas baat ye he ki bijepi jahaan madhya gujarat ke shahari votaron ke bharose hai, vahiin rahul is ilaake kii gramin aabaadi khaskar daliton-adivaasiyon ko lubhaane main lage hai
 This is the reason why Rahul is going to Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar's Sankalp Bhoomi tomorrow
 madhya gujarat main 63 vidhansabha sitgujarat kii kul 182 vidhansabha siton main se 63 siten madhya gujarat se aati hai
 If you look at the results of the last assembly elections, the bjp's sting has been ringing in central Gujarat as well
 2012 kevidhansabha chunaav main madhya gujaratki 63 siton main se 40 siton par bijepi ne jeet darj kii thi, to congress ne 21, ensipi ne 1 or 1 seat nirdaleey ne jiti thi
 The bjp's stronghold, ahmedabad-vadodaramadhy, Gujarat consists of Ahmedabad, Dahod, Kheda, Anand, Narmada, Panchmahal, Vadodara districts
 inamen se ahmedabad or vadodara bijepi kaa majboot garh hai
 Both these districts are in the urban area
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon kii baat karen to ahmatbaad kii kul 21 vidhansabha siton main se 17 bijepi ne jeetin jabaki congress ko mahaj 4 siten milin
 Out of the 13 seats in Vadodara, BJP won 10 seats while Congress got 2 and 1 seat in the account of others
 gramin ilaakon main congress kaa dabadabbahmadabad or vadodara ko chhod diya jaae to madhya gujarat ke gramin ilaake vaala kshetra congress ke dabadabe vaala mana jaataa he
 Five districts of Dahod, Kheda, Anand, Narmada, Panchmahal have more rural population than the seven districts of central Gujarat
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main in jilon main yaa to congress kaa palada baari rahaa yaa phir muqabla baraabar kaa rahaa he
 The Congress got 5 seats in the 7 assembly seats of Kheda district of central Gujarat, while the BJP got just 2
 aanand jile kii 7 vidhansabha siton main congress ko 4, bijepi ko 2 or anya ko 1 seat mili
 Of the 6 seats in Dahod, 3 were won by BJP and 3 by Congress
 panchmahal jile main 7 siten hai, jinamein se bijepi ko 4 to congress ko 3 siten milin, vahiin narmada kii donon siten bijepi ne jeetin
 Farmers, Patidars and Adivasis play an important role in the political decision of central Gujarat
 patidaaron or kisaanon par majboot pakad ke chalate bijepi lagaataar satta ke singhaasana par kabiz hoti aa rahi he
 Political experts believe that the bjp's hold has weakened in central Gujarat in the last few days
 sardaar patel kii janmabhumi se siyaasi kavayadahardik patel ke netritv main 2015 main hue patidaar aarakshan andolan se mana ja rahaa he ki bijepi se patel samudaay naaraaz he
 This is the reason that recently BJP President Amit Shah under the leadership of Gujarat Deputy CM Nitin Patel started the Gaurav Yatra from Sardar Patel's birthplace
 vahiin ab rahul gandhi bhi sardaar patel ke janmasthan nadiyad jaaenge
 The Congress and the BJP are trying to put the Patel community in their favor and Sardar Patel's birthplace has become a political arena for them
 patel ke saath-saath rahul ko ambedkar kaa bhi aasaramadhya gujarat kaa kshetra adivaasiyon or kisaanon kaa garh mana jaataa he
 Tribal voters are in favor of Congress, which is why Congress won the seat in tribal areas in the last election
 rahul gandhi madhya gujarat ke daure par adivaasiyon main milenge
 On 10 October, Rahul will also visit Baba Saheb Ambedkar's 'sankalp Bhoomi' in Vadodara
 iske jariye rajya ke daliton-adivaasiyon par apni pakad majboot karne kii kavayad he

 com / zvkpgmzdxf — Sachin Tendulkar (@sachin_rt) April 24, 2018 vakt bada nirmam he
 If all goes well, Nirmala Sitharaman would have become the pioneer of India's biggest dream budget
 20 sitambar ko korporate tex main katautee ke saath nirmala ne pi
 Chidambaram (1997-98 made a huge history with corporate, personal income tax, excise, custom cuts)
 lekin yah arthvyavastha he or isamen is baat kii koi ganrti nahin hoti ki ek jaise faisle ek jaise nattejey lekar aaenge
 1
 5 lakh karod rupye ke tohfe (companiyon kii kamai par tex main abhootpurv kami) kii aatishbaajee khatm chuki he
 Most of the selected companies who have received this gift will not distribute it to customers, but will be digested
 share bazaar ke chatur-sujan dhahte suchakaankon se apni bachat bachaate hue is vitamin ke ulate asar kaa mijaan lagane lage hai
 Because even after this dose, there is a fear of decreasing earnings of companies because there is no demand in the market
 companiyon par tex ko lekar sarkaar ke kaam karne kaa tarika anokhaa he
 The Modi government imposed heavy taxes on companies in its first term
 share bazaar main soochibaddh sheersh companiyon kii kamai par tex kii prabhavi dar (riyaayaten aadi katkar) 2014 main 27 fisad thi jo badhate hue 2019 main 33 fisad par ai
 Now reduce it to 27
 6 fisad kiya gaya he
 Who will answer that industrial investment has been falling since 2014, so why tax increase or surcharge on companies' earnings was increased in the new budget? But we know that the latest tax concession is the biggest corporate gift in the history of India • CRISIL said that 1,074 big companies (turnover above Rs 1,000 crore in 2018) will get the biggest benefit from this concession i
e
 Rs 37,000 crore
 , Which accounts for 40 per cent of the total corporate tax collection
 in par lagane vaala tex anya companiyon se zyada tha
 • These companies are spread over 80 industries
 or neshnal stock exange ke bazaar puunjikaran main 70 fisad kii hissedaar hai, isliye share bazaar main teji kaa bulbula bana tha
 • In 2018, around 25,000 companies made profits, which contribute 60 percent to the government's total tax collection
 arthvyavastha ke kuch buniyadi tathyon kii roshni main bazaar or nivesh khud se hi yah puch rahe hai ki 1,000 companiyon ko tex main chhot se maang kaise lautegi or mandi kaise dur hogi?gharelu bachat kaa aankada companiyon ko is riyaayat kii praasangikta par sabase bada sawaal uthaata he
 In previous years, investment or demand has not affected the savings of companies
 2019 main privet korporate seaving jidipi ke anupaat main kai dashakon kii oonchai (12 fisad) par thi
 On the other hand, the savings of the common people (household savings) are at the lowest level (3 percent) for several decades
 aam logon kii aay ghatane se bachat or khapat dhahi he
 They were in need of a concession, the giants do not have the resources to invest
 tex ghatane or karj par byaaj dar kam hone se badi companiyon kii bachat badhegi, bazaar main khapat nahin
 India's recession is deeper in labor intensive industries rather than capital intensive which provide the most employment
 companiyon kii kamai se milane vaale tex kaa 55 fisad hissaa tel gas, upabhokta saamaan, niryaat (soochna takanic, pharma, ratnabhushan) aadi udyogon se aata he jabaki rojgaar dene vaale nirmaan yaa baari nivesh vaale kshetra tex main keval das fisad kaa hissaa rakhte hai
 They are not going to get any great benefit from this concession
 korporate ke is tohfe kaa bill khaasaa baari he! tex sangrah kii tuutati raftaar or munaafon par dabaav ko dekhte hue sarkaar kii yah krupa khajaane par 2
 1 lakh crore will incur a burden of 1 in proportion to GDP
 2 fisad tak he
 States will suffer more from this
 kendriya karon main suubon kaa hissaa kareeb 40 fisad ghat jayega
 Through the Finance Commission, the central government also wants to cut the resources of states from the center
 agar aisa hua to rajyon main kharch main jabardast katautee tay he
 It is worth remembering that state spending is the biggest fuel of demand in local economies
 companiyon kii kamai par tex riyaayat ko lekar america kaa taaja tajurba naseehat he
 Donald Trump had cut corporate tax drastically (35 to 21 percent)
 vah bhi us vakt jab america arthvyavastha mandi se ubar chuki thi, byaaj dar nunatam thi or share bazaar gulzaar tha
 The US stock market made a jump after the tax fell, earnings of companies increased but after 21 months, US GDP has dropped one percent from its peak, the stock market is only 5 percent higher than then, the pace of investment slowed down, The mood of consumers is depressed and the deficit is increased
 milton freedman phir sahi sabit hone ja rahe hai ki sarkaron ke samaadhaan aksar samasyaon ko or badha dete hai!*** Pakistan has been critical of India due to the internet service coming to a standstill in Kashmir, but an international report has revealed that for nine consecutive years, Pakistan is not independent in terms of internet usage
 isi ke saath is saal pakistan ne is maamle main 100 se 26 score kiya he jabaki pichley saal yah 27 tha
 Freedom House (NGO) on Tuesday released its Freedom on the Net (FOTN) report titled 'the Crisis of Social Media', which recorded an overall decline in global Internet freedom from June 2018 to May 2019
 is
 don news kii report ke mutabik, repot main pakistan ko 100 (sabase kharaab) main se 26wein number par rakhaa gaya he, pichley saal kii rekking ke mukaable yah ek sthaan neeche he
 This country has scored 5 out of 25 for barriers to internet usage, Pakistan has scored 14 out of 35 for a limited amount of things searched on the internet, and Pakistan in case of violation of the user rights index Has scored seven out of 40 points
 vaishvik str par, internet or digital media swatantraaa ke maamle main pakistan das sabase kharaab deshon main se ek he
 In terms of regional ranking, Pakistan is the third worst country after Vietnam and China
 internet swatantraaa main ai giravat ke alaava report main yah bhi paaya gaya ki pakistan main suchanaatmak ranneeti ke madhyam se chunaav main bhi herpher kiya gaya he jinamein ati-pakshpaat tikaakaron, boats (internet program) yaa bhraamak yaa galat jaankaree failaane ke liye news site ke saath-saath connectivity par antarrashtriya pratibandh or websites kii blaking jaise takneekee chaal bhi shaamil hai
 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has expressed her desire to meet Home Minister Amit Shah
 mamata ne grahamantri se milane kii ichha aise vakt jataai he jab sibiai kolkata ke purv police kamishnar rajeev kumaar ke khilaaf hathaudaa chalaa rahi he
 In fact, the CBI has formed a special team to trace former Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajiv Kumar in the Saradha chit fund case
 saath hi unka pataa lagane ke liye sibiai kai jagahon par chhapemari bhi kar rahi he
 According to sources, summons has been sent to Rajiv Kumar three times
 wo ab tak hajir nahin hue hai
 In a major setback to Rajiv Kumar, the CBI approached the Kolkata court for a non-bailable warrant (NBW)
 sibiai ne rajeev kumaar ke khilaaf warrant jari karne ke liye barasaat court ke samaksh yachika daayar kii he
 At the same time, the Kolkata High Court on Friday rejected Rajiv Kumar's interim bail plea
 iske baad rajeev kumaar se sibiai kaa sampark nahin ho paa rahaa he
 At the same time, on Wednesday, Mamata Banerjee reached PM residence to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 is dauraan mamata ne piem modi ko mithai or kurta bhent kiya
 Also, PM was invited to come to Bengal
 piem modi se mulaakaat ke baad mamata banerjee ne kaha ki piem ke saath charchaa acchhee rahi
 i did not meet her after taking over as PM in the second term
 mamata banerjee ne kaha ki maine rajya ke liye 13500 karod rupee kii maang kii he
 Also, change of state name is also pending
 ham unke suzav ko bhi sweekaar karne ko taiyaar hai
 Mamta Banerjee called her meeting as Chair to Chair meeting
 desh kii sabase khatarnakcommando forceenesji yani neshnal security gards pehali baar apane javaanon ko nai suraksha chunautiyon ke liye taiyaar kar rahi he
 The soldiers are being trained keeping in mind the different types of attacks taking place in different cities of the country
 aisi kisi bhi chunauti se nipatane ke liye baqayada 'mock drill' kii ja rahi hai
 Commandos are present in the mock drill from the Delhi headquarters of NSG to other parts of the country
 mock drill ke jariye ek hi vakt main alag-alag hamalon se nipatane kii kshamta kaa test kiya ja rahaa he
 The NSG wants to make its strongest preparations on the matter that if ever the enemies of the country conspired to target many cities at one time, they can be given a befitting reply
 bataa den ki saal 2008 main huemumbai hamalemen enesji ne is tarah ke atake kaa saamana kiya tha
 The attack was described by the force as a curtain racer
 lekin ab takanic or stritji main mahatvapurn pragati hui he
 Apart from electronic gadgets, the commando force has also purchased a k9 camera system for its dogs, with the help of which one can monitor 360 degrees during operation
 aatankiyon ke khilaaf ladane ke liye yah takanic cmanderon ko majboot banaati he
 Through this technique, the operational commander gets to know from the cameras on the dog goggles which suspicious place or enemy he is looking at
 itnaa hi nahin, gurdaspur or pathankot airbase jaise aatanki hamalon se paar paane ke liye bhi enesji commando ko vishesh training di ja rahi he
 Explain that after the Mumbai attack, India has strengthened its security
 abhi tak bhartiya surakshabalon ne mumbai atake jaise kisi bhi napak mansoobon ko kaamyaab nahin hone diya he
 In such a situation, this mock drill of NSG commands will prove to be important in failing the conspiracy of the enemies

 eveluesarv ke vishleshan main kaha gaya he ki nokia ke ausat briki mulya main 2005 or 2009 ke bich 39 pratishat kii giravat ai jabaki samsung ke liye yah giravat 33 pratishat rahi

 unhone kaha ki sarkaar 2,000 rupee ke noton kaa vimudrikaran nahin, balki charanbaddh tareeke se unhen chalan se baahar karegi
 Gurumurthy said, "in the past we have likewise removed many series of notes from circulation
" " unhone kaha ki sarkaar chote noton ko chalan main banaae rakhane ke prati katibaddh he
 Gurumurthy's remarks come at a time when the government is talking about demonetisation of Rs 1,000 notes to curb black money, on the other hand it has issued 2,000 notes, which contradicts its stance
 sarkaar kii ore se to is par koi jawaab nahin aayaa, magar aresas ke vichaarak ne safai de di he
 Let us tell you that S
 Gurumurthy has described the demonetization move of the central government as 'financial Pokhran' and said that it is expected that such a change in the economy will become an example
 unhone kaha ki is nirnay se jameen jaaydaad kii keemton main giravat kii shuruyaat hogi or paardarshita ko badhaava milegaa
 Describing demonetisation as 'financial pokhran', Gurumurthy said that when people have surplus money, they have a desire to buy goods that are not needed and thus promote 'irresponsible and heartless spending'
 notebandi se bada badlaav aayega
 He said, 'the way Pokhran brought about a fundamental change in thinking
 koun sochataa tha ki america, bharat ke bare main sochega
 If we had not done nuclear tests, they would not have looked at you
 
 
 ’ gurumurti ne kaha ki jis tarah se pokharan ke baad bharat main buniyadi badlaav aayaa or logon kii uske prati soch badali usee tarah ‘vittiya pokharan‘ se bhi buniyadi badlaav aayega lekin ise samajhane, gananaa karne va logon ko iske bare main samajhane ke liye bahut alag soch samajha kii jarurat he
 The comments ullekhneey he ki bharat ne 1998 main pokharan main parmaanu pareekshan kiye the or desh un chuninda deshon main shaamil ho gaya jinke paas parmaanu hathiyaaron kii kshamta he
 At the same time, the note ban was announced on the night of 8 November this year, under which the then 1000 and 500 rupee notes were removed from circulation
 purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne notebandi ko ‘aitihaasik prabandhkeey bhul’ bataaya he
 Gurumurthy said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken this step of demonetisation so that the 'big managerial mistakes of the economy' can be removed after 2004 by the UPA government
 gurumurti kii tippanee aise samay main ai he, jab sarkaar kaledhan par lagaam lagane ke liye 1,000 rupee ke noton ke vimudrikaran kii baat kah rahi he, duusari taraf usne 2,000 ke note jari kiye hai, jo uske rukh ke prati virodhabhas paidaa karata he
 There was no response from the government, but the RSS thinker has given clarification
 bataa den ki es gurumurti ne centre sarkaar ke notebandi ke kadam ko ‘vittiya pokharan’ jaisaa qaraar diya he or kaha ki isse arthvyavastha main aise badlaav kii ummid he jo ek udhaaharan banegaa
 He said that with this decision, the prices of land property will start to fall and transparency will be increased
 notebandi ko ‘vittiya pokharan’ bataate hue gurumurti ne kaha ki jab logon ke paas adhishesh paisa hota he to unamem aisi vasteen kharidne kii ichha jaagti he jinaki jarurat nahin hoti or is tarah se ‘gaiyr jimmedaarana or hrydayviheen kharch’ ko badhaava miltaa he
 Demonetisation will bring big change
 unhone kaha, ‘jis tarah se pokharan se soch main buniyadi badlaav aayaa
 Who thought that America would think about India
 agar hamane parmaanu pareekshan nahin kiya hota to ve aapaki taraf dekhte hi nahin
 
 
 'gurumurthy said that the way Pokharan changed India and changed the way people think about it, in the same way' Pokharan 'will also bring about a fundamental change, but it is very important to understand, calculate and convince people about it
 Different thinking needs to be understood
 tippaniyan It is noteworthy that India conducted nuclear tests in Pokhran in 1998 and the country joined the select countries which have nuclear weapons capability
 vahiin notebandi kii ghoshnaa is saal 8 november kii raat ko kii gai jiske tahat 1000 va 500 rapaye ke tatkaaleen noton ko chalan se baahar kar diya gaya
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has termed demonetisation as a "historic managerial mistake"
 gurumurti ne kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne notebandi kaa yah kadam isliye uthaaya he taaki samprag sarkaar dwaara 2004 ke baad kii gai ‘arthvyavastha kii badi prabandhkeey bhuulon’ ko dur kiya ja sake

 enpiti ke naam par china ne enesji kii raah rokiloksabhaa main supriya sule or saugat bose ke poorak prashn kaa jawaab dete hue videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki maine pehle bhi kaha tha, aaj bhi kah rahi hum, sadan main kah rahi hum ki china ne prakriyaagat vishyon ko uthaaya tha
 China had said how a country not signing NPT can become a member of NSG
 is tarah sechin ne baadhaaen khadi kii
 Taking the Congress under siege on the pretext of China, Sushma said that once no one believes, we cannot say that he will never agree
 unhone kaha ki hamaare congress ke mitra jiesti par nahin maan rahe hai
 All other parties have agreed
 keval congress nahin maan rahi he
 We are engaged in celebrating
 videsh mantri ne kaha ki lekin congress ek baar nahin maane to kya ham yah kahen ki ve kabhi nahin maanenge
 We are trying to persuade, maybe GST is passed in this session
 ham enpiti par hastakshar nahin karengesushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki 2008 meresainya parmaanu sambandhijo chhot hamen mili thi, usamen enpiti kaa sadsy bane bina hi aage badhaane kii baat kahi gai thi
 He made it clear that we will never sign the NPT
 iske liye hamaari purna patibaddhta he
 On the stand of the earlier government on NPT, Kayamswaraj said that we also give credit to the earlier government for this
 2008 ke baad se chah saal is patibaddhta ko pehle kii sarkaar ne puraa kiya or iske baad vartmaan sarkaar ise aage badha rahi he
 He said that India did not try to get membership of NSG, but it was half-complete
 enesji sadsyta kii raah main aage badha bharatsushamaa ne kaha ki enesji kii sadsyta ke prayaas main bharat ko safalataa nahin milane ko kootnithik vifaltaa nahin mana ja saktaa
 this is not right
 unhone kaha ki pehle yah kaha jaataa tha ki kya bharat enesji kaa sadsy ban paaegaa
 Now it is being asked that India will become a member of NSG

 Narayan Dutt Tiwari was one election away from the Prime Minister's chair in 1991
 tiwari to yahi maanate hai, 'narsingh raav ne chunaav nahin ladaa, ve piem ban gaye
 i contested, incidentally lost by 5,000 votes and could not become PM
 haar bhi sirf isliye hui ki abhinayta dilip kumaar ke chunaav prachaar ke baad virodhiyon ne is baat par hangaamaa khadaa kar diya ki yusuf khan ne apana naam dilip kumaar kyon rakhaa
 The issue of compulsion to change the name of a Muslim actor became an obstacle in Tiwari's path and he still has that defeat in his mind
 pradhanmantri banane kaa unka khwab bhale hi puraa nahin ho paaya par siyasat main unki dakhal kabhi kam nahin hui
 Born on 18 October 1925 in Baluti village in Nainital, Tiwari was the President of the Students' Union at the University of Allahabad at the time of independence
 tiwari sambhawatah desh ke iklaute bade netaa hai jo bharat ke ganraajya banane ke samay se raajnneeti main pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup se sakriy hai
 Tiwari, who has been the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand four times and once in Uttarakhand and a minister of almost every important department at the Center, is not among those who have been imprisoned in the past
 kisi bhartiya vyakti kii ausat aayu (65 saal) ke baraabar raajnneeti main bitaane ke baad ab jabaki ve khud khadey nahin ho pate or mixi main pisa hua khaanaa khate hai, unka rajnatik punarjanm hua he
 After the Hyderabad Raj Bhavan sex scandal and the alleged son dispute, political pundits had read him as a political Murcia
 us samay shaayad hi kisi ne sochaa tha ki dekhte-hi-dekhte tiwari phir se maujuun ho jaaenge
 And even if they did exist, in what way
 dehradun ke forest research institute main unki 1 number kii kothi phir se congressi raajnneeti kaa centre ban gai he
 He contested no elections after 2002, but contested at least 7 candidates from Congress in 2012
 unhone haldwani, ramnagar, kashipur sahaspur, vikasnagar, jaspur, rudrapur or gadarpur main congress ke ummidavaaron ke liye sabhaayen kin or road sho karke vot maange
 They went from helicopter to place
 congress sutron ke mutabik, uttar pradesh main lagbhag do darjan siton par unke prachaar kii maang hui thi, lekin sehat kii vajah se vahaan prachaar kar paanaa tiwari ke liye sambhav nahin ho sakaa
 His bone and digestive system may have weakened, but there is politics in his body and his brain still works like veteran leaders
 prachaar ke dauraan tiwari ne yah kahkar sabko chaunkaa diya ki ve ek baar phir, lekin sirf dhai saal ke liye, uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri ban sakate hai
 Why two and a half years? Because after two and a half years they will become 90s
 matganana se ek haftaa pehle apni kothi main india today se baatcheet karte hue tiwari kehete hai, 'umr ko dekhte hue ab bagdor nahin sanbhaalani, salaah deni he
 'but his supporters present in his room disagree
 yuva congress ke netaa rahe anil kumaar sharma kehete hai, 'rajya ko unke maargdarshan kii jarurat he
 The next Chief Minister will be Tiwari Ji
 ' tiwari ke gaiyr-rajnatik sanghathan nirantar vikaas sampark samiti ke adhyaksh or udyogpati bharat sharma bhi chaahate hai ki tiwari kam-se-kam chah maheene ke liye mukhyamantri jarur bane
 Tiwari, once a special correspondent of the Congress National Herald, listens as a journalist
 diggaj netaa kii tarah unki baton kaa ve na to samarthan karte hai, na virodh
 By the way, Tiwari is desperately awaiting the results of Uttarakhand elections these days
 matdaan ke lagbhag ek maheene baad bhi nateeja na aane se ve naakhush hai
 They say that the result had to be stopped for so long, that is, there is some deficiency
 ve vyangy main kehete hai, 'na khaataa na bahi, jo kuraishi (mukhya nirvachan ayukta) kahen, vahi sahi
 Despite all the controversies and the last stage of the age, what is the special thing that does not allow Tiwari to become a past in Congress politics? The political life of many leaders has been seen to end after such a controversy
 karnataka vidhansabha main porn dekhne vaale mantriyon kii vaapasi aasaan nahin hogi
 After one such true or false sex CD, the political career of an MP in Bihar came to an end
 tiwari ke tike rahane kii sabase lokapriy vyakhya yah he ki ve vikaas purush or saumy netaa hai
 But Om Prakash Valmiki, who is going to the Indian Institute of Advanced Studies (IIAS) of Shimla by becoming a Hindi writer and fellow living in Dehradun, repeats an old statement by Bal Thackeray, 'big people don't do wrong things
 ' ve kehete hai ki tiwari kii saamaajik prishthbhumi bhi unke paksh main kaam karti he
 Valmiki recalls, 'how Dalit leader Jagjivan Ram, who came very close to the post of Prime Minister, was burdened with the allegations of scandal on his son
 'lekin padmashri se sammanit dehradun nivasee kavi or lekhak liladhar jagudi is vyakhya se sahamat nahin hai
 He says that in the Indian folk tradition, no one is rejected because of sexual allegations
 tiwari par lage aarope sahi hai to bhi clasical mithology ke hisaab se unhone koi galat kaam nahin kiya he
 Jagudi says, 'congress has removed Tiwari in the election campaign and washed off the allegations against him
 'congress ke uttarakhand pradesh adhyaksh or congress ke chunaav jeetne kii haalat main mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar yashpal arya kehete hai ki congress ne party adhyaksh sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ke netritv main rajya kaa chunaav ladaa he
 However, Arya remembers Tiwari's time as chief minister between 2002 and 2007, saying that 'the state grew the most during that time
 ' tiwari ke virdohi bhi is tathy se inkaar nahin karte
 Tiwari also does not want to remember the Raj Bhavan scandal in late 2009, 'this is not all
 ghatnaayen ghatit hoti rahati hai, un baton par kya kaha jaae
 'tiwari's fair-skinned and tremendous memory is the secret: plenty of sleep
 ve is umr main bhi atyant chaitanya hai or time magazine or india today kii copy file karwaakar rakhte hai, jin par gulabi, hari or pili parchiyaan lagi hai
 He talks about why companies like Blackberry, Samsung, Sony and Nikon are not in India
 ve kehete hai, 'bharat ko china, japan or korea ke baraabar khadaa hona chahie
 'they are worried about North India lagging behind South India
 tiwari ke canvas par uttarakhand nahin, desh he
 Tiwari, who was once Manmohan Singh's boss in the Planning Commission, says about dividing Uttar Pradesh into smaller states, 'younger brother Prime Minister Manmohan Singh must think
 'uttarakhand main kehete hai ki jis par geet ban gaya vah nibat gaya
 Narendra Singh Negi's folk song CD Nauchmi Naraina on Tiwari was a super hit among the people

 Due to being between two metros like Delhi and Lucknow, the traffic on this road is generally very high
 haive se guzar rahe ek car main savaar do ladakon kii najar sadak kinare padi ek laavaaris suutakes par padati he
 He feels strange to see a suitcase lying on the roadside like this
 lihaaja wo car roak dete hai
 Initially, both of them thought that the suitcase might have fallen down from a vehicle passing by
 chunki din kaa vakt tha or ilaaka aabaad
 So both of them get down from the car and get closer to the suitcase
 ek ladke ne pehle suutakes ko tatol kar dekha
 But it was quite heavy
 iske baad un ladakon ne jaise hi suutakes kaa jip kholaa donon kii lagbhag chikhen nikal padin
 There was a corpse in the suitcase
 ab agle kuch pal khud ko sanbhaalane ke baad donon ladakon ne kisi tarah himmat jutai or police ko phone kar diya
 The police was on the spot in a few minutes
 ab police ne suutakes kaa baariki se muyna kiya
 The corpse belonged to a man
 umr yahi koi chalis ke aasapaas rahi hogi
 There were countless injury marks all over the body
 laash kabje main lene ke baad police ne use postmortem ke liye bhijwa diya
 Apart from the suitcase and the corpse, no other such thing was found from the surroundings, which would have given any clue about who killed or killed
 amroha pulicene sabase pehla kaam yahi kiya ki aasapaas ke saare thanon main laavaaris laash milane kii khabar bhijwa di
 The news also had an impact
 gajiabad police ne apane ilaake se gaayab kareeb 40 saal ke ek shaks ke bare main amroha police ko khabar di
 Abhishek Gupta, a Ghaziabad property dealer, was mysteriously missing from his house for two days
 gharavaalon ne gajiabad main uski gumshudagi kii report bhi likhva rakhi thi
 Is Abhishek Gupta's body found in a suitcase? Abhishek Gupta's family members were called to identify the body
 shaq sahi niklaa
 The corpse belonged to Abhishek Gupta
 lekin 19 disambar ko muradabad jane ke liye ghar se niklaa abhishek aakhir suutakes main kaise pahunch gaya?do din se gaayab property dealer abhishek gupta kii talash main lagi gajiabad police use dhundhane main to kaamyaab ho chuki thi
 But the truth of Abhishek's body found in the suitcase was yet to be found
 abhi ye pataa lagaana baaki tha ki aakhir abhishek ko suutakes tak kisne pahunchaaya?is sawaal kaa jawaab katl ke makasad main hi chupa tha or jab tak makasad kaa pataa nahin lag jaataa kaatil tak nahin pahunchaa ja saktaa tha
 Thus, it starts from Abhishek's house
 abhishek ke gharavaalon se poochtacha to hoti he
 But the householders are unable to throw any special light on the case
 udhar, jis tarah se katl ke baad laash ko suutakes main band kar hive ke kinare niptaya gaya tha, usase itnaa to saaf tha ki ye katl, lutpaat jaisi kisi vajah se nahin, balki dushmani ke chalate kiya gaya he
 That is, whoever the murderer was, was an enemy of Abhishek
 dushmano ko khangalaneke liye ab police abhishek kii kol detail nickelwati he
 It was also suspected that someone might have killed Abhishek due to business rivalry
 is koshish main jab police ne kol detail khangaalane shuru kiye, to ek number par jaakar uski nigaah thahar gai
 This was the number on which Abhishek not only had the most frequent conversations, but also on December 19, the last time before the murder, Abhishek had called this number
 lekin ye number naa to kisi kaarobaari kii thi naa abhishek ke gharavaalon main se kisi kii
 Rather the number was that of a girl named Prerna
 chunki maut se pehle aakhri baar prerana ne hi abhishek se baat kii thi lihaaja police sidhe prerana ke paas pahunchati he
 During questioning, Prerna agrees to know Abhishek well, but does not give any specific information about the murder
 police kii chaanbin jari rahati he
 At the same time, it is revealed that Prerna's Abhishek Gupta was not only speechless, but the two were also very close to each other
 police ko ye bhi pataa chalata he ki abhishek akasar prerana ko paise bhi diya karata tha
 Even after all this information, the police were still not able to reach the purpose of murder or murder
 haalanki police kii najar ab bhi prerana par hi thi or isi baarik najar kii vajah se achaanak police ko ek aisi baat pataa chalati he jo puure cese ko ek nayaa mode or makasad donon de jaati he
 Of course Abhishek and Prerna were very close to each other, but Prerna had another boyfriend
 amit, to kya maamla lav triangal kaa he? yaa phir sajeesh kii jad main kuch or he? or agar prerana hi kaatil he, to katl se ain pehle abhishek ne usee ko phone kyon kiya tha?police ke samnekahani main ab teen kirdaar the
 One himself Abhishek, the other Prerna and the third Amit
 puri kahani inhen teen kirdaaron ke ird-gird thi
 Therefore, the police now started taking out the horoscopes of Amit and Prerna
 tafteesh ke baad jo kahani saamne ai wo kuch yun thi
 There was an old relationship between Abhishek and Prerna
 abhishek aksar apni shaam prerana ke flats main uske saath hi gujaarta tha
 He would fulfill every request of inspiration and often gave him money
 isi bich amit prerana kii jindagi main aa gaya, donon ke bich bhi nazdikiyaan bad gayi
 Then, with the passage of time, Amit came to know about Abhishek
 udhar, amit kii jindagi main aane ke baad prerana bhi ab abhishek se peechha chhudaana chaahati thi
 But Abhishek would reach Inspiration's flat every evening drunk
 lihaaja abhishek se peechha chhudaane ke liye prerana or amit ne use raste se hi hataa dene kaa faisla kar liya
 This was the last day of Abhishek's life
 aksar hone vaali mulakaaton kii tarah is din bhi abhishek prerana se milane ke liye uske flats main aane vaala tha
 But Amit and Prerna had already decided that if Abhishek made the mistake of coming to her flat today, this would be the last day of his life
 shaam hote hi sharaab ke nashe main dhutt abhishek prerana ke flats main ja pahunchaa
 As soon as he arrived, Amit, already ambushed in the flat, made a strong attack on Abhishek's head
 achaanak hue is hamale se abhishek ghabara gaya or ladkadaa kar jameen par gir gaya
 After this, Amit and Prerna together attacked Amit so much that he lost his life
 chunki donon pehle hi abhishek ko thikaane lagane kii taiyaari kar chuke the, lihaaja bagaiyr vakt ganvaae pehle to abhishek kii laash ko ek suutakes main bharaa or phir use thikaane lagane ke liye raat ke andhere main hi ghar se baahar nikal gaye
 Why did Abhishek make the last call to Prerna before she disappeared? So the answer was that before coming to the flat, he was finding out from the inspiration whether he was in the flat or not
 police ke mutabik abhishek or prerana ke rishte itane gupt the ki agar kol ditels naa hote to prerana tak pahunchnaa bhi mushkil tha
 In the 2012 Gujarat assembly elections, when the BJP won 115 seats due to the relentless election campaign of Chief Minister Narendra Modi, his rival and Congress leader Shankar Singh Vaghela told one of his friends with the claim, "BJP 115 The seats were won only because of the delimitation of 182 seats in the Gujarat Legislative Assembly after the 2007 elections, in which urban seats were increased at the cost of rural seats
 Mr
 went out
 agar siton kii sthiti 2007 kii manind hi hoti to bhaajapa 105 siten jeetne main bhi kaamyaab nahin hoti
 In that case there would be a fight between the BJP and the Congress
 " waghela kii yah tippanee hakeekat se bahut dur bhi nahin thi
 For example, in the rural areas of northern Gujarat, where a huge crowd gathered during Modi's rallies in 2012, the party did not do well
 gujarat main kareeb do saal pehle disambar main hue jila panchayat chunaav main congress ne 31 main se 23 siton par bhaajapa ko shikast di
 In the taluk elections, the Congress got a good number of seats compared to the BJP
 in donon chunaav ke nattejey gramin gujarat ke bare main waghela kii baat kii tasdik karte hai
 The victory is seen as a challenge for the BJP and an opportunity for the Congress to return to Gujarat
 donon sthaneey chunaavon main hui haar kaa matlab saaf he ki gusse se sulag rahe gujarat ke gaanv ab ubal pade hai
 The BJP has come to know of its cracking land in rural Gujarat, which is why it has started celebrating the angry villagers
 bhaajapa ne das hajaar se adhik gaanvon main narmada yatra nikaali
 But women, farmers and laborers shied away from it and this journey was also opposed in villages
 bhaajapa ne gramin gujarat ko lubhaane kii ek or koshish ke tahat yahaan kii gramin or kasbaai 149 vidhansabha siton ko cover karte hue ''gujarat gaurav" yatra nikaali
 But this visit also failed to show much effect, to make it effective, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, Information and Broadcasting Minister Smriti Irani and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath were made its main part
 ek or koshish sidhe bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne ahmedabad main toun haul kaarykram karke kii
 In addition to Ahmedabad, 1
25 lakh youth from more than 100 places were connected live with DTH technology
 lekin in koshishon ke bich yah saaf dikh rahaa he ki 22 varshon se rajya main sattashin or rajya kaa kayapalat karne kaa daawa karne vaali bhaajapa kaa pradesh netritv gramin gujarat se sidhe samvaad karne kii himmat nahin juta paa rahaa he
 For this work, BJP is trying to connect people like Varun Patel and Reshma Patel, old colleagues of Hardik Patel, who are leading the Patel movement
 haalanki narendra patel ke saath das lakh ke ''cash cond" ne bhaajapa kii is koshish ko bhi dhakka pahunchaaya he
 The incumbent BJP government appointed chairmen and directors in 18 board corporations to woo voters, raised Anganwadi, Ashavarkar salaries by 50 per cent, reduced petrol and diesel prices by 3 to 4 rupees
 sarkaar ne fiks pe par padhaa rahe shikshakon ko sthaayee karne kii ghoshnaa bhi kar di
 The purchase of cotton and groundnut from farmers at the minimum support price (MSP) has already been announced before Diwali
 sthaneey chunaav main gramin janata kaa janamat saaf najar aayaa or use dekhakar yah bhavishyavaaneehone lagi he ki in nateezon kaa asar vidhansabha chunaav main padegaa
 While this speculation is giving hope to the Congress, it is a cause of concern for the BJP
 isi ummid ke saath congress gujarat main apni rajnatik jameen talashne main jute gai he
 His hope was further strengthened by OBC Kshatriya leader Alpesh Thakore joining the party and Hardik's support
 vahiin jignesh mewaani kaa bhaajapa se virodh congress ke liye ek or shubh sanket he
 This time the Congress will give tickets to young Patidars and OBC faces on a large scale
 congress ne apane sau ummidavaaron kii suchi par phir se manthan karne kaa man banaaya he
 The resentment of the rural areas is a big challenge, as well as there are two more important reasons for the BJP to look more weak in the elections this time than last time
 pehla, do dashak se satta main hone ke kaaran satta virodh rujhaan or doosraa, gandhinagar main modi kii gaiyr maujuudagi
 Although the party has the charisma of Modi as PM, despite this, the bjp's trajectory to climb to power is difficult
 yuva tikdi jignesh mewaani, hardik patel or alpesh thakor bhi bhaajapa ke liye ek chunauti bane hue hai
 The grip of these young leaders of rural background is as strong in the cities as in the villages
 madhya gujarat, uttar gujarat or saurashtra main patel yuvaaon kii ek acchhee khaasi taadaad yuva netaa hardik patel ke saath he
 Hardik, who is agitating for reservation, is forming a clear alliance with the Congress to defeat the BJP
 saurashtra main kai jagahon par bhaajapa ke pradesh adhyaksh jitu vaghani kii gujarat gaurav yatra se zyada log hardik kii sabhaaon main umade
 For example, the Gujarat Gaurav Yatra in Upaleta town in Rajkot district was welcomed by only 800 people while Hardik's gathering at the same place attracted 4,000
 hardik is baat ko acchhee tarah jaanate hai ki janata ke bich ve behad lokapriy hai
 He expressed his opinion to Babaki, saying, "the attitude of the rural people is against the BJP
 vah bhaajapa ke chal bhare gujarat model kaa sach jaan chuki he
 In these elections, the villagers will unite and give their verdict against the BJP
 " aisa nahin he ki yah keval hardik kii banaai hui raay ho
 This is evident in the crowd gathering in their rallies in rural areas
 is tikdi ke duusare bade netaa hai obisi kshatriya yuva netaa alpesh
 He became the leader of his community by running an anti-alcohol movement and was trying to establish himself as the leader of all OBC groups before joining the Congress last month
 alpesh kaa sharaab virdohi andolan shahar ke bahari ilaakon or khaskar gaanvon main charchaa main rahaa
 In such a situation, Thakor is a very popular face among the people at present
 yuva dalit netaa jignesh teesri or badi chunauti hai
 Jignesh is the leader of the class who is not only marginalized in the villages but also in the cities, his position is not good
 una andolan main jis tarah se jignesh ne bhoomika nibhaai usase vah daliton ke netaa banakar ubhare
 And the way people also took him by the hand, it is known somewhere that this community needed a leader
 jignesh ne is khalipan ko bhar diya
 Recently another incident came to light in Gujarat in which a Dalit youth was beaten to death by some people when he was involved in Garba
 isi tarah kii ek or ghatana gandhinagar ke limbodara gaanv main hui
 In it, a Dalit youth was allegedly brutally beaten up because he had a mustache
 gaanvon main to yah ghatnaayen aam hai lekin shaharon main bhi aisi vaaradaaten saamne aa rahi hai
 In such a situation, Jignesh's popularity is continuously increasing
 jignesh daliton hi nahin balki adivaasiyon ke bhi netaa hai
 He has also made a mark in this community by launching a campaign to expose the BJP which failed to provide land under the Forest Act to the tribals
 unhone apni sanstha rashtriya dalit adhikaar manch or adivasee kisaan sangharsh morcha kaa gathjod kar ke saaf sandesh de diya kii ve in donon samudaay ke netaa hai
 The ruling party is aware of the challenge of this young leadership that emerged in Gujarat
 isiilie saurashtra, kuccha or uttar gujarat main is baar patidaar, obisi or adivasee votaron par bhaajapa kaaphi focus kar rahi he
 She is clearly trying to help the community associated with these three leaders
 182 seat vaale gujarat main shahari or ardh-shahari siton kii sankhya 72 he
 The BJP is in a strong position in these places
 lekin gramin ilaakon vaale 110 vidhansabha siton main bhaajapa ke ab tak ekajute rahe votaron ko alpesh, jignesh or hardik patel kii tikdi ne khandit kar diya he
 The BJP is currently trying to break its vote bank in rural areas, if it cannot be saved from breaking due to any reason, at least voters should be prevented from uniting towards the Congress
 bhaajapa kii yah ranneeti bayaan kar rahi he ki party rakshaatmak mudra main he
 However Bhupendra Yadav, BJP general secretary and in-charge of Gujarat, says, "the party will win 150 seats
 satta virdohi rujhaan puure rajya main kahin nahin he
 The Congress organization is nowhere to be seen and the internal battle is at its peak
 "haalanki bhupendra ke in daavon ko bhaajapa ke ek sutara hi khaarij kar dete hai
 According to the source, the real challenge of the party will come after the ticket distribution
 jin logon ke tikat katenge unke samarthak niraash hokar ghar baith jaaenge
 But even when the ticket was cut when Modi was there, the MLA or his supporters were not disappointed, instead everyone remained united in the name of Modi
 is tikdi ke saath hi gramin kshetron ke chote vyapaariyon, dastkaron or kaarigaron ke upar afra-tafari main lagu kiye gaye jiesti ke kaaran upje gusse ne bhaajapa ke liye tasviir or sakht kar di he
 Issues such as farmer suicides, debt waivers and note ban on Tissar have made this picture even more frightening
 haalanki haal hi main chote vyapaariyon or dastkaron ko jiesti main di gai raahat ne sattadhari party ke liye sthiti ko thodaa sudhara he
 However, the BJP has not lost everything in rural Gujarat
 congress ke saamne paaramparik rup se apni virdohi jatiyon—patelon or obisi kshatriyon—ko jode rakhane kii chunauti he
 Actually Patel is traditionally anti-congress caste
 itnaa hi nahin, patel or obisi kshatriya gramin ilaakon main rajnatik rup se ek-duusare ke virdohi hai
 In such a situation, the OBC Kshatriya community can go in favor of BJP
 raajnneetik vishleshak vidyut thakkar ke mutabik, ''gramin kshetron main patelon kaa bhaajapa ke khilaaf hona khud-ba-khud obisi samudaay ko vipareet disha main ekajute kar degaa
 Even today the feud between Patel vs OBC runs here
 "iske baad saurashtra main coli factor maujuud he jo bhaajapa ke paksh main kaam kar saktaa he kyonki is samudaay ke sarvaadhik lokapriy netaa bhaajapa ke purushottam solanki hai
 But the biggest factor in favor of the party here is that the OBC people are opposed to the influential Patel community in general
 agar patel samudaay khulkar bhaajapa ke khilaaf utarataa he to ye donon samudaay bhaajapa ke saath ja sakate hai
 Though these two communities are united only when the issue of Hindutva dominates, but this time it is not so
 haalanki ''gujarat gaurav" ke rup main sthapit narendra modi kii chhavi abhi bhi majboot he
 This image remains intact even in villages
 agar modi apni is chhavi kaa phayda in chunaavon main uthaa paae or 2019 ke chunaavon par lakshya sadhate hue janamat sangrah apane ird-gird hi rakh paane main kaamyaab hue to bhaajapa chunaav jeet sakati he
 bjp's campaign strategy also testifies that it wants to take advantage of this image of Modi
 yahi vajah he ki chunaavon ke dastak ke saath hi rajya main modi kii awajahi bad gai
 The BJP has also planned to hold more than 50 rallies of Modi
 jaahir he, modi kii reliyon main logon kii khaasi shirkat rahegi
 If Modi's magic works, the results may come in his favor
 iske alaava, mukhyamantri vijay roopaani kii seva sethu yojana bhi asar kar sakati he
 This scheme of "good Governance" as a whole was first introduced by taking ten villages at the tehsil level (a tehsil can have 40 to 70 villages)
 up-tehsil ke rup main laayaa gaya yah nayaa navela concept bhi gramin kshetron main bhaajapa ke paksh main ja saktaa he
 In the last one year, the government has covered one crore people under phase three of the scheme so far
 yah aankada rajya kii aabaadi kaa kareeb chhathvaan hissaa he
 The BJP is in a stronger position in urban areas than in rural areas, but despite having the largest urban population in the country, 57 percent of the population in Gujarat still lives in the village
 yahi aabaadi bhaajapa kii pareshaani kii vajah he
 This time the BJP, which performed almost equally in the urban and rural areas in the 2012 election, will woo the villagers only then it will get the power of Gujarat

 Former Australian fast bowler Glenn mcgrath is married to Jane
 1997 main donon kaa pataa chalaa ki jine maikgra ko stan yani breast cancer he

 The Sydney Pink Test has become one of the best ways to fight breast cancer in Australia and with the help of sports, people have come together to fight the disease

 According to the news coming from Bihar, Nitish Kumar will not be the next Chief Minister of the state
 sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki nitish apana istipha waapas nahin lenge
 On Monday, the JDU Legislature Party will approve his decision
 duusari taraf, party ke adhyaksh sharad yadav ne bhi saaf kar diya he ki nitish ji kaa faisla antim faisla he
 It will not be changed

 Significantly, Nitish resigned from the post of Chief Minister of Bihar on Saturday taking moral responsibility for the party's poor performance in the Lok Sabha elections, which has also been approved by Bihar Governor DY Patil
 haalanki, nitish ne vidhansabha bhang nahin karne kii sifarish kii thi

 In the coming days, Khadi's fashionable clothes will be seen written in Made in UP
 maamla yah he ki gujarat kii tarj par ur pradesh main bhi khaadi niti lagu hogi
 Khadi and Village Industries Minister Satyadev Pachauri of UP government reached Allahabad, said that the state government would soon formulate a policy of Khadi
 iske liye masauda taiyaar ho chukaa he or ise agle saal april main lagu kiye jane kii sambhaavna he
 He claims that this will change the picture of both UP and Khadi in the coming days
 uttar pradesh ke khaadi evam gramodyog mantri satyadev pachori ne bataaya ki soobe keeyogi adityanathsarkaar rajya main khaadi niti lagu karegi
 Till now, this type of policy is applicable only in Gujarat in the country
 khaadi evam gramodyog mantri ne kaha he ki khaadi for nesan or khaadi for fishan kii theme ko lekar rajya sarkaar lagaataar khaadi ko badhanaa dene main juty he
 He has said that along with the old traditional charkhas to promote Khadi Mission, solar charkhas will now be promoted
 khaadi aaj desh hi videshon main bhi teji se lokapriy ho rahi he
 He said after the resumption of the long-standing blanket factory, that the entire draft of the proposed Khadi policy has been prepared and plans to be implemented in April 2018
 pachori ne bataaya ki abhi tak khaadi utpaada banane par sarkaar 10 pratishat kii sabsidi detii he
 In the new policy, the government will give 15 percent subsidy instead of 10
 ab khaadi se tirangaa jhanda bhi bhadohi main banaaya jayega
 He informed that a total of seven blanket factories which have been closed in the state will be reopened very soon
 isaki shuruyaat bhadohi main band ek kambal kaarkaana ko khol kar kii ja rahi he
 The government will buy the blankets that will be made from factories

 During this, the officers reprimanded the poor condition of the factory

 com / x7bsinorhl — ANI (@ani_news) March 14, 2016 aaj se teen saal pehle jab bijepi peedigat badlaav ke muhane par khadi thi, us vakt rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) pramukh mohan bhagwat ne tippanee kii thi, “raakh se bhi uthakar khadi hogi bijepi
 "this statement created a ruckus, and his cleanliness was also noticeable," i said that BJP will stand up from the ashes, the ashes have not happened
 agar hogi to vahaan se bhi khadi ho jaaegi
 This statement of Bhagwat and his explanation on it was in line with the roadmap to establish his strong hold on the BJP
 ise unhone us vakt or bhi saaf kar diya jab dilli main baithe chaar diggajon (di-4) sushamaa swaraj, arun jetali, venkaiya naidu or anant kumaar ko nakaarne ke baad kabhi chunaav na jeetne vaale apane hi vidarbha kshetra ke nitin gadakari ko adhyaksh banwaaya
 Now once again the BJP is facing internal wrangling and the Sangh itself is in a dilemma to increase its chances of the BJP having lost two consecutive general elections or to retain its hold on the organization
 atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar banane ke baad aresas ne sanghathan or sarkaar ko swatantra chhod diya tha
 But Bhagwat does not want to repeat this experiment of the Sangh, so by ignoring all the surmuses sitting in Delhi, the Sangh, which has bet on Gadkari, has tried to give him a second term
 sangh main number do kii haisiyat rakhane vaale sarkarywah suresh joshi urf bhaiyyaji bhi gadakari ke khilaaf tamaam aaropon ke baavjood unhen doosraa kaarykaal die jane ke khilaaf nahin dikhte (padhein suresh joshi urf bhaiyyaji se baatcheet)
 Why should Gadkari also be tested in view of the allegations? On this question, Joshi says, "sure, but be sure, but i think they will try to meet that criterion
" ” haalanki ve adhyaksh ke liye gadakari ke naam par nirnay main sangh kii kisi bhoomika se do-took inkaar karte hai
 But for Bhagwat, Gadkari is the trump card through which he can maintain a hold on the organization
 aresas kii duvidha 2014 main sarkaar ke netritv ko lekar he
 a member of his All India Executive Board says, "it has become clear in the discussions within the family that there is no other face other than Narendra Modi who has the potential to bring the party to power in 2014
 modi ko laane se gathbandhan bhi majboot hota dikh rahaa he or chhitak chuke hindu vot bank ko ekajute kiya ja saktaa he
 "but the Sangh's dilemma is whether it would like a government in which it has no interference?" The Sangh brand stuck in this controversy is not even rejecting Modi completely
 bhagwat ke ek vishwast kehete hai, “abhi aath rajyon ke chunaav hone hai, ham abhi se apane pattey kyon kholen?” sangh netaaon kaa bhay modi ke gujarat model se hi he, jahaan unke aage sanghathan bouna ho chukaa he
 These leaders argue that if Modi is projected once or not, he will be established as the leader among the second generation leaders
 aise main na modi apana kabja chhodia chahenge, na hi aresas unhen nazarandaaj kar sakegaa
 According to sources, the Sangh Parivar has a big hurdle with Nitish Kumar in the way of Modi, because the core team of Bhagwat is considered against Modi
 modi ko sirf sah sarkarywah suresh soni, dattatreya hosbale or madan das devi kaa hi samarthan hasil he
 While Devi is currently not active due to health reasons, there has been constant speculation to shun the responsibility of co-ordinating with the BJP by giving away Sony to Bhagwat's trusted Sarkarivah Gopal Krishna
 sutron ke mutabik, gopal krishna or ke
 C
 kannan ko salbhar pehle do nae pad gathit kar bhagwat ne isliye sah sarkarywah banaaya tha taaki unke nirnyon par vipareet raay kaa prabhaav na pade
 It is worth noting that when Bhagwat became Sarsanghchalak, Soni was supposed to be Sarkaryavah, but Bhagwat chose Bhaiyyaji for this post
 bijepi kii kaman puri tarah se duusari peedi ke haath aane or sangh kii yojana ko amali jama pehanaane ke makasad main nishchit taur par rashtriya adhyaksh gadakari ek majboot upkaran banakar ubhare hai
 In his two-and-a-half-year tenure, he has not only gained an edge over the D-4 as per the expectations of the Sangh, but has also not hesitated to ignore his opinion in many important decisions
 gadakari ke rajnatik salaahkaar or rambhau mhaalagi prabodhini sabha ke nideshak vinay sahasrabuddhe kehete hai, “gadakari paaramparik raajnneeti main aaparaparik urrja ke strot hai
 "it is Gadkari's unwavering faith in the RSS that the RSS reposed all names and expressed confidence in Gadkari after bjp's name was put forward for the presidency of Jaitley, Rajnath Singh, Swaraj
" sangh kii koshish he ki gadakari adhyaksh bane rahen or pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar kaa faisla baad main ho, taaki chunaav baad sarkaar banane kii sthiti banati he to unke jariye sangh apni manmarjee chalaa sake
 At the 'agenda Aaj Tak' program in December, Gadkari also put forward the Sangh's thinking, "I say with full authority and confidence as party president that we will not project anyone before the elections and only the right time comes
" But the Prime Minister will announce the name of the candidate
 ” saaf he ki aresas har haal main sanghathan par kabja kar sarkaar kaa bhavishya bhi tay karnaa chahta he
 Bhagwat's opinion about BJP is said to be associated with the Sangh's image
 isliye atal-adwani yug ke baad sangh ke liye yah pehla mauka he jab vah party par apana kabja bana saktaa he or iske liye gadakari unke sabase vishwast sipahasaalar hai
 When his company 'purti' was accused of foul play, Bhagwat, a chartered accountant by his close and profession
 gurumurti ke jariye jaanch karakar gadakari ko paak saaf dikhaane kii koshish kii
 The Sangh has always been anxious about the BJP
 bijepi ke think tanks rahe govindacharya kehete hai, “pichhali baar (2009) jo hua, uski chaaya ab bhi he
 But the Sangh comes in the case of BJP only when the party does not think
 ” gadakari par aarope lagane or gurumurti ke jariye unke paksh main kii gai sangh kii pahal, 2009 main bhagwat kii bijepi ko lekar kii gai tippaniyon ko govindacharya kuch zyada dakhal maanate hai
 But he believes that he does not always interfere
 unke mutabik, gadakari ko adhyaksh banane main bhi sangh kii bhoomika salaah tak simit thi
 The difficulty of the sangh-bjp relationship is that it does not even openly confess it nor does it want to leave the BJP open
 bhaiyyaji bataate hai ki jab jansangh bana to shyama prasad mukherjee ne tatkaaleen aresas pramukh guru golwalkar se madad maangi
 After which Guruji gave some volunteers for help
 haalanki ve yah bhi kehete hai, “jansangh aresas ke mudde par hi janata party se alag hua, isliye kuch na kuch rishte to bane hue hai
 "the increasing interference of the RSS in the bjp's affairs is due to modernity with family duality and decreasing presence in branches
 jaahir he ki sangh jitna gadakari kii adhyaksh pad par dobaaraa tajposhi ko lekar spasht he, utana hi 2014 main sarkaar banane or uske netritv ko lekar sanshay main bhi he
 However, Modi is also looking to improve relations and in the honor ceremony held at the BJP headquarters after the victory in Gujarat, he only gave credit to the organization for becoming a CM from a small worker
 jharkhand ke nae siem hemanth sorain ne kaha he ki gathbandhan sarkaar hone ke baavjood ve koi aisa kaam nahin karenge, jisase logon ke hit kaa nuksaan ho, chaahe sarkaar chale yaa na chale
 During the interview given till date, Hemant Soren said that the post of CM is 'kanto Bhar Taj', but we accept this challenge
 unhone kaha ki unhen bahumat sabit karne main koi dikkat nahin aegi
 Regarding the legal aspect, the law will do its job
 unhone kaha ki spikar koi ho, ve bahumat sabit karenge
 On the issue of corruption, Hemant Soren said that people who are facing corruption cases cannot be held guilty until proven
 unhone kaha ki bhrashtachar baahar se aayaat nahin hota, yah bauddhik logon ke liye hi he, yah gaanvon main nahin he
 Soren defended former CM Madhu Koda saying that even though he is in jail today, he has been acquitted in many cases
 unhone kaha ki kuch jhuthe maamle bhi un par laade gaye hai, ummid he ki ve bedaag baahar aaenge
 'chhote Soren' said that JMM has proved that the right is not obtained by seeking, but by snatching
 naksalwad kii samasya par sorain ne kaha ki naksaliyon se baatcheet ke liye daravaaje hameshaa khulaa hai
 He said that he himself would initiate talks if needed
 pradhanmantri narendra modi is saal ke aakhir tak america daure par jaaenge
 The White House says that US President Donald Trump is waiting to host him
 white house ne apane elaan main piem modi ke daure kii tarikhon kaa elaan nahin kiya he
 This announcement by the Trump administration is a sign that the warmth in relations between the two countries is still intact

 yah aisa avasar tha, jiske liye pichhali sarkarein tarasati raheen
 After liberalization, many experiments of reforms could not hold ground because the political relations of the Center with large and resource-rich states were not warm
 2017 ke baad rajyon ke chunaav nattejey hi sirf is ashanka ko majboot nahin karte balki kuch or tathy bhi isaki pushti karte hai ki kyon ek taqatvar sarkaar ko apane kaamkaaj ke bajaae bhaawanaaon kii hawa baandhani pad rahi he

 november, 2011 ke baad se lagaataar til-til kar dam tod rahi kingfisher airlines july kii shuruyaat main hi jameendoj ho jane ke liye taiyaar najar aa rahi thi
 Salary-deprived and angry employees threatened to go on strike, and the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) began talking about suspending its work, as financial stress could have a serious impact on passenger safety
 haalanki karmchaaree 14 july ko hadtaal par chale hi gaye, jo do maah main paanchavin hadtaal thi, lekin mritpraaya airline bachi rahi
 DGCA e
 ke
 Bharat Bhushan could not continue in office
 pradhanmantri kii adhyakshata vaali cabinet kii niyukti samiti dwaara dijisie ke rup main unhen 30 november, 2012 tak kaa ekstansion dene kii manjuuri die hue ek saptaah bhi nahin beetaa tha ki 10 july ko unhen pad se achaanak hataa diya gaya
 On 9 July, Bhushan wrote a note recommending that a notice be issued to Kingfisher asking them to immediately arrange payment to their employees and debtors
 note main aage likhaa he ki agar puraa bhugtan na ho, to bhi kam-se-kam ek bade hisse kaa bhugtan kiya jaae
 He wrote, "it can be indicated that if the funds are not provided within 15 days of receiving the notice and there is not a significant reduction in the liabilities, then we are forced to stop their work
" Can occur
 '' unhone yah bhi kaha ki kingfisher ne apane karmchaariyon ko farvari, 2012 ke baad se vetan nahin diya he, jo chintaa kaa kaaran he
 He wrote, "special security in (kingfisher's) operations continues to be ignored
 isaki lekha pariksha ke dauraan kai ejineering mudde ubhare hai, jinka suraksha par sidhaa asar padataa he
 "so was Bhushan removed so that Kingfisher could be relieved?" Civil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh says that this assumption is wrong
 unhone india today se kaha, ''hamane yah baat shuruyaat main hi bahut saaf kar di thi ki sarkaar kisi bhi nijee airline ko belout nahin degi
 "but the issue is not about bailout or salvage
" jo sawaal bhushan ne uthaaya tha, vah yatri suraksha par tha
 According to sources, Bhushan had raised the issue of security several times
 jab vimaanon kaa rakrakhaav ejiniyaron dwaara raat ke 2 baje kiya jaataa he or payalat raat-biraat udaan bharte hai, to vittiya or maansik tanaav kaa suraksha par sidhaa asar pad saktaa he
 Ministers do not make much sense of it
 unka kahana he ki desh main pichley chah maheene main koi (hawaii) durghatana nahin hui he
 He says, "as far as stress on pilots and engineers is concerned, how can you measure it?" i am confident that Kingfisher's management will eventually pay their dues
 '' vishleshkon or vimaanan visheshgyon kii raay is tarah kii ashaavadita se hameshaa mail nahin khaati he
 Meanwhile, Kingfisher Airlines says that it is operating with the maximum possible safety under the dgca's close supervision
 bhushan ko achaanak hataae jane ke sawaal par yubi group ke upaadhyaksh (korporate communications) ramprakash mirpuri ne kaha ki yah kahana ''behad galat or sharaarat se bharaa he ki iskaa kingfisher airlines se kisi bhi tarah se koi sambandh he
 Ajit Singh and Executive DGCA Prashant Sukul insist that there was no controversial note of 9 July
 bhushan ke note kaa gum hona chaunkaane vaala rahasy he kyonki iskaa arth yah he ki ise records se fadkar nikaala gaya
 It is a legal offense
 mantralay ko iske alaava bhi kai or baton kaa khandan karnaa pad rahaa he
 On 21 July, Indigo Airlines promoter Rahul Bhatia claimed that "the government is tweaking the aviation policies for a few select companies in the industry
" '' unhone kaha, ''ham lagbhag shunya rin vaali company hai, or hamen unase hode kerani pad rahi he, jinhen ek ke baad ek madad mil rahi he
 Without naming Kingfisher Airlines, Bhatia said he knew of "showy competition" from government-owned Air India, but called him "the government's tireless efforts to keep inefficient private operators in business"
 Sorry
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ek company ko badhaava de rahi he or isse hataasha paidaa hoti he
 Without naming any airline on the issue of Bhushan's removal, Bhatia said that "the equivalent of DGCA in the US is the Federal Aviation Administration
" agar aisi sthiti unke saamne aati he jisamen kisi airline ke chaalak dal ko maheenon se bhugtan na kiya gaya ho, chaahe vah payalat hon yaa takneekee staff, to main guarantee detaa hum ki ve airline ko suraksha ke aadhaar par band kar denge
 "the Ministry of Civil Aviation had to issue a detailed clarification on 25 July after Kingfisher Airlines was given priority," no financial assistance is being provided directly or indirectly to private operators but rather to market forces
 Permission to work as per '' isamen yahaan tak kaha gaya ki ''duniyabar main kahin bhi aisa koi regulatory dhaancha nahin he, jo keval karmchaariyon ke vetan kaa bhugtan karne main naakaam rahane par airline kaa license radd karne kii anumati detaa ho
 Ajit Singh insists that there was no proposal to cancel Kingfisher's license
 mantri mahoday kehete hai, ''yadi kisi sheduld airline ke paas chaalu haalat main paanch vimaan or equity kii ek nishchit rakam he, to iskaa license tab tak radd nahin ho saktaa, jab tak suraksha kaa mudda na ho
 "but Bhushan had raised the issue of security
 haalanki mantralay ko kingfisher kii lachar mali haalat, vetan kaa bhugtan na karne or suraksha main koi sambandh najar nahin aata he, yah bhushan dwaara baar-baar uthaae gaye mukhya muddon main se ek he
 In a note on March 23, Bhushan referred to a meeting with Kingfisher owner Vijay Mallya on March 20, in which Mallya had allegedly claimed that "despite unpaid work for a long time, his employees would not have any Do not complain
 ''lekin bhushan ne tippanee kii he, ''airline karmchaariyon ke vibhinn virgon ke saath meri baatcheet ke baad meraa maananaa he ki unke bich asantosh apane charam par he
 i am of the opinion that this situation raises many questions about the security of their services
 anischitata or tanaav or sabase upar yah tathy ki koi samaadhaan kahin najar nahin aa rahaa he, or iskaa nateeja jaan-bujhkar yaa anjaane main hone vaali aisi ghatnaon main nikal saktaa he, jiske bhayaavah parinaam ho sakate hai
 "bhushan had expressed similar concern in the controversial note dated July 9, which could not be found in the records of the ministry
 unhone 20 july ko apane uttaradhikari sukul ko bheje patr ke saath kingfisher ke note kii ek prati sanlagn kii thi, jisamen uske laapata hone kii jaanch karne ke liye kaha gaya tha
 According to sources close to Bhushan, the note was part of Kingfisher's financial monitoring file (number 23-11)
 yah note dijisie ke up nideshak amit gupta ne taiyaar kiya tha or ise up mahanideshak (hawaii suraksha) lalit gupta ne bhushan ko bheja tha
 Traffic information shows that the file came to the DGCA office on 9 July and went back to Lalit Gupta on the same day
 note kahata he ki (kingfisher kii) vittiya sthiti lagaataar najuk bani hui he, ''hawaii adda operataron, tel companiyon or vendor kii kaaphi dendaree bakaayaa he
 Bhushan also mentioned that the airline's operations were being closely monitored since November 2011 and there has been a significant reduction in its fleet
 jo mul sheetakaaleen shedul tha, udaanon kaa shedul uske lagbhag ek chauthai par roak diya gaya tha
 The International Air Transport Association (IATA) suspended the airline's billing and settlement plan, forcing the airline to cease its international operations from 11 April 2012
 iske alaava, airline ne purvottar kshetra main bhi apane kaamkaaj main katautee kar di he
 This route is mandatory for all airlines
 mantralay ke sutron ne bataaya ki kingfisher ne apana sheetakaaleen shedul 30 aktubar, 2011 ko pesh kiya tha
 According to him, the airline was to fly 460 flights daily with a fleet of 64 aircraft
 lekin uske fouran baad airline ne apni tay udaanon ko radd karnaa shuru kar diya or 11 november, 2011 ko dijisie dwaara vittiya nigaraanee karne kaa aadesh diya gaya
 spicejet, indigo and other private airlines were also brought under the scanner after receiving reports that they too were flying less than scheduled flights

 The court has rejected the petition filed against Akhilesh Yadav's two government bungalows while Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh
 court ne yachika ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki ab ye yachika prabhaavaheen ho gai he
 The court turned down the petitioner's demand that he be allowed to file a petition in the High Court
 pichhali sunwaayee main supreme court ne kaha tha ki mukhyamantri ke paas do bangale rahen to isamen harj kya he? ek bangala rahane ke liye to doosraa sarkari kaamkaaj ke liye
 The Chief Minister has a lot of work, a lot of people come to meet him, so if another bungalow has been taken for office work, what is wrong? In this way, the judges also have two parts, a secretariat and a residence, although the Supreme Court had said that elections are to be held in UP, so the matter will be heard in April after the election
 tippaniyan In fact, the Public Interest Litigation was filed by the Lok Prahari Sangathan by the Supreme Court
 yachika main akhilesh ko paanch kalidaas maarg ke bangale ke alaava chaar vikramaditya maarg par sarkari bangala dene ko chunauti di gai thi
 Earlier in November, the Lucknow High Court gave a major relief to Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, the court dismissed the petition challenging the allotment of a second bungalow to him
 bench ne kaha tha ki mukhyamantri dwaara pehle se aavantit ek bangale ko karyaalay ke taur par bhi istemaal kiya ja rahaa he, jahaan jaahir taur par bahut se log milane aate honge
 In such a situation the privacy of the family must have been violated
 lihaaja, duusare bangale kaa aavanton aisa vishay nahin, jisamen court hastkshep kare
 The petition said that besides the 5 Kalidas Marg, the Chief Minister was told to allot 4 Vikramaditya Marg bungalows beyond the UP Ministers (salary, Allowances and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act - 1981
 esen shukla ne court ko tark diya tha ki ukt adhinium main isi saal sanshodhan karte hue yah aavanton isliye bhi kiya gaya he taaki mukhyamantri ke kaaryamukt hone ke baad bhi bangala unke paas bana rahe
 At the same time, the government argued that since 1985, the practice of allocating two bungalows to the Chief Minister is going on in the state
 mukhyamantri ke paas bahut kaam hote hai, bahut saare log milane aate hai iske liye agar daftar ke kaam ke liye doosraa bangala liya gaya he to kya galat he? is tarah to jajon ke paas bhi do hisse hote hai ek sachivalay or ek awaas haalanki supreme court ne kaha tha ki upi main chunaav hone hai isliye maamle kii sunwaayee chunaav ke baad april main karenge

 isse pehle november main lakhanu hoicourt ne mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ko badi raahat dete hue court ne unhen doosraa bangala aavantit kiye jane ko chunauti dene vaali yachika khaarij kar di thi
 The bench had said that a bungalow already allotted by the Chief Minister is also being used as an office where many people would obviously come to meet
 aise main parivaar kii niztaa kaa hanan hota hoga
 Therefore, allocation of second bungalow is not a subject in which the court intervenes
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki mukhyamantri ko 5 kalidaas maarg ke alaava 4 vikramaditya maarg bangale kaa aavanton upi ministars (vetan, bhatte or prakeern upbandh) adhinium- 1981 se pare jaakar kiya janaa bataaya gaya
 SN Shukla had argued to the court that the amendment in the said Act this year has been done so that the bungalow remains with him even after the Chief Minister is relieved

 Now it will be seen how much truth is there in the talk of both women and only after investigation it will be able to tell the police

 Every film in this series was accompanied by a great outpouring of grandeur and action
 is baar bhi kuch aisa hi kiya gaya he
 Aamir Khan and Katrina Kaif have been used as surprise packages
 katrina caff ke liye film main karne ke liye kuch khaas nahin he
 Has been introduced as glamor but not used
 film theth hindi sine premiyon ke liye kisi jashn se kam nahin he
 Technology, gadgets, bikes and action are also this time like every time
 sab haai quality he
 But the story is completely childish
 kahani main kitna damajaiki shroff da great indian sarkas chalaate hai
 They borrow a lot and they are unable to repay it
 aatmahatya kar lete hai
 His son Sahir (aamir Khan) then takes up the task of starting his circus again and starts committing thefts
 isamen uskaa saath detii he aalia (katrina caff)
 Just like every time Jai (abhishek Bachchan) and Ali (uday Chopra) come to stop the thieves
 bas yaheen se shuru ho jaataa he dhooma-dhadaaka
 Although the story has many lochs
 teen ghante kii film he
 What is not digestible is that the Chicago police have failed and the Mumbai police are called and two of their police officers show their jauhar abroad
 is tarah kii kai baaten jo gale nahin utarati hai
 The star appeal will not be accepted by Aamir Khan's film because it is completely different from the Aamir print film
 isamen koi kahani nahin he
 There is no thrill
 kahani ke maamle main aamir kii sabase kamjor filmon main se ek kahi ja sakati he
 Aamir Khan does not get cast in a negative character
 kahani puri tarah se khaamiyon se bhari hui he
 Katrina's pairing with Aamir Khan is not very good to the eye
 katrina ko jitna mauka mila unhone apana best kiya he
 Abhishek Bachchan is the same as Jai
 ali ke kirdaar main udai jame hai or vah film main hansaane kaa kaam karte hai
 The budget of the film is more than Rs 100 crore
 film kii tikat 50 se 900 rupee tak kii he
 a bumper opening is expected
 marketing kaaphi jabardast rahi he
 In such a situation, the film is expected to join the Rs 200 crore club
 lekin kamjor kahani kai tarah ke shubahaa paidaa karti he lekin bada binar film ko sambhaal saktaa he
 It would not be wrong to say that Dhoom 3 has been nineteen compared to its first films
