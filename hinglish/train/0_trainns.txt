 ) Describing himself as out of the race for the post of Prime Minister, BJP President Rajnath Singh today gave a clear indication that Narendra Modi will be the top candidate if the BJP comes to power after the 2014 general elections
 rajnath singh ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki chunaav ke najadik aane or chunaav ke baad bhi or adhik sahyogi party main aaenge
 He also said that developmental issues will be more important in the bjp's election campaign than the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute
 bhaajapa adhyaksh ne kaha, yah aavashyak nahin he ki party adhyaksh main bheed jutaney kii bhi kshamta honi chahie or vahi pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar bhi hona chahie
 i have a responsibility to do the party work
 mujhe kaam karnaa he or vah kaam he
 
 varsh 2014 ke chunaav main party kii jeet
 Beginning his five-day trip to New York and Washington, Rajnath said in a press conference, "seven months before the election, i appointed Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi as the chairman of the party's election campaign committee
" isamen anokhi baat kya he ? hamane modi ko vaise hi niyukt kiya he jaise or partiyaan niyukt karti hai
 Why are they being interpreted? maine unki chhavi, lokapriyata or party ke prati patibaddhta ko dhyaan main rakhte hue prachaar pramukh namit kiya he
 Asked whether all these signs point to Modi being the prime ministerial candidate, Rajnath Singh said, "the Chief Minister is undoubtedly India's most popular and powerful leader at the moment
" rajnath singh ne kaha, vah na keval gujarat main bheed ke bich lokapriy hai balki tamilnadu, andhra pradesh, uttar pradesh or bihar main bhi
 From north to south, east to west
 rashtriya damakham vaale vahi ekmaatr netaa hai
 His popularity will help the party in the election
 party adhyaksh ko loksabhaa chunaav main pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke rup main pesh nahin kiye jane ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki hameshaa aisa nahin hota
 "my interest is to bring the BJP back to power at the Center and cover the bag of corruption-ridden Congress, while being party president," he said
 chunavi vaayadon ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki bhaajapa ram janmabhumi mudde ke bajaay vikasaatmak bahes ko badhayegi
 He also said, Ram temple has never been a major election issue
 bahut adhik kahen to yah ek rashtriya mudda he, lekin chunavi mudda nahin
 Rajnath has traveled to the US along with party MP Ananth Kumar and party leaders Vijay Jolly and Sudhanshu Trivedi
 singh mangalvaar ko washington main ek sammelan main bharat, afghanistan or kshetreey suraksha par apana mahatvapurn bhaashan denge
 He said that by comparing the performance of the performing NDA government and the corruption-stricken Congress-led UPA government, the people of India have realized that BJP is the only solution
 rajnath singh ne kaha ki gujarat , madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh jaise bhaajapa shasit kai rajyon kaa kaary pradarshan janata dekh rahi he ki yadi ye rajya kai congress shasit rajya sarkaron ke kharaab pradarshan or udyogon kii kharaab haalat ke mukaable, 24 ghante bijli or svachh tathaa prabhavi prashasan uplabdh kara sakate hai to log kisko tarjeeh denge
 People have made up their mind
 varsh 2014 main rashtriya chunaav kaa saamana karne ke liye bhaajapa dwaara uthaae gaye kadamon kaa byora dete hue unhone kaha ki party ne prayek booth par chunaav booth samitiyon kaa gathan kar sanghathanaatmak str par badlaav kiye hai 
 He said, Indian voters have now realized that the Center cannot guarantee five percent growth rate whereas Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have around ten percent growth rate
 koi bhi ab adhik samay tak bhartiya matadaataaon ko bevakoof nahin bana saktaa
 Referring to the recent party debacle in Karnataka and the setbacks in several other states, the BJP president said that assembly elections and body elections are different from parliamentary elections where people vote for a stable government
 unhone kaha ki congress jald hi satta se bedakhal ho jaaegi
 Rajnath Singh said, We are confident that the failure of the Congress government will help the BJP to return to power at the Center
 satta main aane kii icchhuk kisi bhi party ko svachh prashasan dena chahie or logon kii jaruraton ko puraa karnaa chahie
 If they fail, they will be out of power
 sahyogi dalon ke bhaajapa chhodkar jane ke sawaal par rajnath singh ne kaha ki bhaajapa loksabhaa chunaav main spasht bahumat hasil karne kaa prayaas karegi lekin uske saath hi apane nae or puraane sahyogiyon ko nahin bhuulegi
 "despite the expectation of getting a clear majority, we want our partners to participate in the government at the Center," he said
 ab hamaare paas shivasena or shiromani akali dal hai tathaa chunaav ke kareeb aane par kuch or paas aa sakate hai
 There is a possibility of an alliance with like-minded parties even after the election if the need arises
 party adhyaksh ne kaha ki aane vaale loksabhaa chunaav main telugana mudde par aspashtataa ko lekar congress kaa andhra pradesh main safaya ho jayega

 In the triangular series, now all three teams have won one each
 bharat pehle match main newjiland se 200 ran se haar gaya tha jabaki srilanka ne kiwi team ko teen wicket se maat di thi
 Sehwag's clever batting, however, did not have any response from the Sri Lankan team, who first lifted India from a crisis by scoring a 59-run partnership for the fourth wicket with Suresh Raina (21) and then with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (23 not out) Adding 80 runs for the fifth wicket gave the team a big win

 iske baad unhone randiv or maithyuj ko vishesh nishaanaa banaaya or in par kramash: deep midwicket or squaire leg kshetra main chakke jamaaye
 When Randiv came to the next over, India needed five runs and Sehwag's century seemed certain but Bai got four runs off the first ball and the fourth ball became Noble
 srilanka kii mushkil yaheen par samaapt nahin hui or pehle badlaav ke rup main aaye ishanth ne tilan samarvira ko jadeja ke haathon kaich karakar score chaar wicket par 44 ran kar diya
 Dilshan, meanwhile, made some good shots but lost his grip on the ball of Ojha, whose ball went to Rohit waving with the upper edge of his bat
 dilashaan ne 62 gend kheli or paanch chauke lagaaye
 Jadeja then bowled Sri Lanka's position by dismissing Angelo Mathews (15) and Chamara Kapugedara (10)
 aise samay main randiv or nuwan kulshekhara (22) ne aathven wicket ke liye 39 ran kii saajhedaari karke team ko kuch sammanjanak score tak pahunchaaya

 lalu prasad ne ritlal ke pita kaa pair bhi chuaa
 That is, they are ready to do anything for the daughter's victory
 unki adhiktar jansabhaayen patliputra main hi hui hai
 Misa Bharti also agrees that if she is a daughter, she definitely gets more love from her father
 misa kaa muqabla bijepi ke ramkripal yadav se he, jo haal tak argedy main the or misa unhen chachaa kahati hai

 ranjan yadav bhi misa ke chachaa rahe hai, haalanki wo pichley kai saal pehle argedy chhodkar jediu main shaamil ho gaye
 He defeated Lalu Prasad by 23 thousand votes in the last Lok Sabha election
 misa kaa kahana he ki wo apane chaachaaon ko chit karne kaa gur jaanati hai, kyonki donon hi unke pita lalu prasad ke chele hai
 Misa Bharti's in-laws are in the Pataliputra area, so voters are also noticed

 congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad tisare morche ko samarthan dene se inkaar karne ke baavjood samaajawaadee party (sapa) pramukh mulaayam singh yadav ne guuruuvaar ko bharosa jataayaa ki congress morche ko samarthan dene ke bajaay uski sarkaar main shaamil hogi
 Referring to Rahul's statement without naming anyone at the election meetings held in support of SP candidates from Ballia and Mau, Yadav expressed confidence that the Congress would not support the Third Front government from outside, but would join that government
 ' Significantly, amid all the speculations that the Congress would support the Third Front to form a government after the election, Rahul had denied the possibility of supporting the Third Front in Amethi recently
 sapa pramukh ne bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue unhen desh main sabase adhik jhooth bolne vaala qaraar diya or kaha 'modi in dinon behad pareshaan hai ki unka sach ham tak kaise pahunch ja rahaa he
 Modi should not consider me an idiot
 ham rakshaamantri, mukhyamantri or vipaksh ke netaa rah chuke hai
 i also have sources
 ' He said that Uttar Pradesh is very good compared to Gujarat in terms of law and order
 modi kitna bhi jor laga le, lekin bhaajapa 272 kaa aankada praapt nahin kar paaegi
 Yadav also targeted the Congress and said that the Congress has not done anything that the public should remember
 dilli metro main mahilaon ko muft yatra karne kii suvidha dene ko lekar aam aadmi party sarkaar or metro main ke naam se mashhoor i shridharan ke bich khinchataan jari he
 Now Sreedharan has written a letter to Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on this issue
 dilli metro ke pehle prabandh nideshak shridharan ne sisodiya ko likhe khat main kaha, 'metro main mahilaon ko muft yatra kii suvidha dene kaa meraa virodh tab tak ke liye he, jab tak dilli metro ne jo karj liya he, usko chukaa nahin detii he
 'sreedharan said in his reply letter,' Your government can compensate the loss of Delhi Metro by providing free travel facilities to women, but the governments after you will not be able to do so
 agar dilli sarkaar mahilaon ko muft yatra kii suvidha main kharch karegi, to tex dene vaale log sawaal karenge
 'sreedharan said that the speed of metro line construction in India is very slow due to lack of funds
 yahaan par 25 kimi prativarsh ke hisaab se metro line bichaai ja rahi hai lekin china main 300 kimi prativarsh kii raftaar se metro line bich rahi hai
 He said in the letter that i am not opposed to providing free travel facilities to women, but i am opposed to doing so in the metro
 agar ham metro main sirf mahilaon ko muft yatra kii suvidha dete hai, to student, divyang or senior citigen ko kyon nahin? duniya main kisi bhi metro ne sirf mahilaon ko muft yatra kii suvidha nahin di he
 If the Delhi government cares for women as much, then it is my opinion that instead of providing free travel facilities to women, the Delhi government should send the fare directly to their bank account
 shridharan ne sisodiya ko likhe khat main kaha ki is baat ko sabhi jaanate hai ki vidhansabha chunaav jeetne ke liye dilli kii aam aadmi party sarkaar ne mahilaon ko metro main muft yatra kii suvidha kaa tohfa dene ja rahi he
 Sreedharan has also written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi opposing the convenience of free travel for women in the Delhi Metro
 iske baad sisodiya ne shridharan ko khat likhaa tha or apni naaraazgi jataai thi
 What did Sisodia say about Sreedharan's protest? Manish Sisodia wrote in a letter to Sreedharan, "I am shocked as well as saddened by your letter
" jisamen aapane metro main mahilaon ko muft yatra kaa kharch dilli sarkaar dwaara uthaane ke prastaav kaa virodh kiya he
 After the completion of the third phase of the metro, its ridership will be 40 lakh passengers daily, but according to Delhi Metro, at present the average ridership is 25 lakh
 ' shridharan ko likhi chitthee main dilli ke upmukhyamantri ne kaha tha ki dilli metro apni kul kshamta se mahaj 65 fisadi hi kaam kar rahi he, jo metro kii gunvattta or parformens ke liye behad kharaab he
 Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Sisodia had claimed that after the Delhi government's decision, the number of female passengers in the metro will increase, which will increase the metro's capacity by 90 percent
 unhone kaha tha ki aam aadmi party sarkaar ke prastaav ke baad bhi dilli metro kii rosemara kii ridership sirf 3 lakh yatri pratidin badhegi, jabaki metro kii dizin kshamta 40 lakh yatriyon kii he
 Sisodia had also said that his government's purpose is not to interfere with the functioning of the Delhi Metro, but to show readiness to extend it along with all the projects of the Delhi Metro, which were kept hanging for years
 kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ne'bajet aaj tak'par charchaa ke dauraan kaha ki sarkaar digital connactivity ke madhyam se nayaa bharat bana rahi he
 He said that the government is opening call centers in rural areas so that the youth will get employment
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki hafiz said desh ke liye kya bolta he wo sabko pataa he
 Evidence of the government is working is visible in the survey
 tamaam survey sarkaar ke kaam ko dikhaate hai, haalanki hamen abhi or mehnat kii jarurat he
 'PDP never supported Afzal Guru' On the issue of anti-national slogans in JNU, opposition to Afzal Guru's program and formation of government in collaboration with PDP in Jammu and Kashmir, he said that BJP has formed government in the state for public interest
 unhone kaha ki pidipi ne kabhi bhi afjal guru kaa samarthan nahin kiya he
 The Union Minister said that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of the country
 sarkaar kii ore se kashmir mudde ko sulajhane kii har sambhav koshish ho rahi he
 He said that the Prime Minister of Pakistan has considered the Kargil war as his fault

 apane 'man kii baat' kaarykram main ravivaar ko unhone bataaya ki bharat fifa under-17 vishwacap footbal pratiyogita kii agle saal mejabani karegaa
 Concern over the country's performance in football: In his address to the program broadcast on Akashvani, the Prime Minister expressed grief that in the last few decades India has fallen to a very low position in the FIFA Football rankings, while India won the gold medal in the 1951, 1962 Asian Games
 And India finished fourth in the 1956 Olympic Games
 har noujvaan footbal ke saath judemodi ne kaha ki under-17 vishwacap ek aisa avasar he jo is ek saal ke andar chaaron taraf naujavaanon main footbal ke liye ek nayaa josh, nayaa utsaah bhar degaa

 How did India's youth become interested in sports through the FIFA Under-17 World Cup

 'apart from cricket, trend in sports also, the Prime Minister said that such situation is not right where 65 percent of the population is young and we have lost in the world of sports
 samay he, khelon main ek nai kranti ke daur kaa
 And we are seeing that like cricket in India, now the mood is becoming about football, hockey, tennis, kabaddi
 agle saal 2017 main bharat fifa under-17 vishwacap kii mejabani karne ja rahaa he
 24 teams from the world are coming to play in India

 Today our ranking in FIFA is so low that i do not even dare to speak
 yuvaaon main badi footbal kii deewanagimodi ne kaha ki in dinon bharat main yuvaaon kifootbal main ruchibadhati ja rahi he
 Be it EPL, Spanish League or Indian Super League matches, the youth of India take time to watch on TV to get information about it

 iske saath hi captain viraat kohli ne is salek or sirispar kabja kar liya
 After the match, Virat Kohli looked very happy in the press conference
 lekin ek sawaal ne unhen phir naaraaz kar diya
 When Captain Kohli was questioned by a journalist Nemhendra Singh Dhoni's current form and place in the team, he fiercely defended his former captain
 viraat ne kaha, 'mujhe samaj nahin aata log sirf un par (dhoni) par ungali kyon uthaa rahe hai
 If i do not score runs in three matches, then no one will raise a finger on me, because i am not 35 years old, so why with them? The situation in Rajkot at that time was such that if Hardik Pandya came to bat, he could not even score runs
 kisi ko bhi dhoni par sawaal uthaane kaa koi haq nahin he
 "dhoni is fit and has passed all the fitness tests
 Virat said," He (dhoni) is fit and has passed all the fitness tests
 vah har sambhav tareeke se team ke liye yogadan de rahe hai
 Be it strategically or batting
 agar aap srilanka or australia ke khilaaf kheli gai siries ko dekhen, to unhone behtareen pradarshan kiya tha
 'it is not necessary to be able to perform better every time
 Kohli said that people are constantly targeting the same person, which is not right
 dhoni team main apni bhoomika or khel ko behatar tareeke se jaanate hai
 However, they are not necessarily able to perform better every time
 dilli ke tii-20 match main unhone aate hi jo chakka maaraa tha, use match ke baad kai baar dikhaaya gaya
 Everyone was happy and now suddenly if they are not able to score well in a match, then everyone has fallen behind them
 
 
 
 People should be a little patient, he said, 'I think people should be patient
 dhoni ek aise khilaadi hai, jo cricket ke har praaroop kii samaj rakhte hai
 He is a sensible person
 vah har praaroop main apni bhoomika ko achche se pahachaanate hai
 Therefore, i do not think anyone else has the right to decide their life
 'darasal, siries ke duusare match main team india ko rajkot main kiviyon ne haraaya tha
 After this, questions are being raised about Dhoni's batting
 purv tej gendbaaj ajit agarkar ne sabase pehle is baat ko hawa di ki kya ab bhi dhoni ko tii-20 khelte rahanaa chahie
 VVS Laxman also made a statement that now the time has come to allow Dhoni to make a place in the team for the youth
 bhuvi bole- dhoni par sawaal uthaane vaale pehle unka record dekh lenvirendra sahvaag ne bhi ishaaron-ishaaron main dhoni kii ballebaaji par pratikriya di he
 Instead of directly raising questions, he has advised the team management to inform Dhoni about his role in T20
 sahvaag ne mahendra singh dhoni ko salaah di ki bade lakshya kaa peechha karte hue pehali gend se hi peetna shuru karen or bhartiya team prabandhan se bhi kaha ki dabaav main chal rahe purv captain ko tii-20 team main unki bhoomika ke bare main bataae
 Dhoni scored 49 runs in 37 balls against New Zealand in the second T20 match, but questions have been raised about his selection in the team
 sahvaag ne ek news channel se baatcheet main kaha, 'dhoni ko team main apni bhoomika samajni hogi, unhen bade score kaa peechha karte hue shuru hi main teji se ran banane honge
 The team management will have to tell them about this

 The Supreme Court has reserved its decision on Thursday after the completion of hearing on the petition filed against linking Aadhaar card with income tax
 supreme court ab tay karegaa ki aadhaar card ko PAN card se jodne kaa kanoon Income Tax Act 139AA sanvaidhanik he yaa nahin
 The comments guuruuvaar ko hui sunwaayee main yachikakarta ke vakil arvind dattaar ne kaha ki sarkaar step bai step aadhaar ko anivaary kar rahi he
 This is completely unconstitutional
 ye logon ke moulik aadhaar kaa hanan karata he jo desh main free trade karne kaa adhikaar detaa he
 Under this law, if an Aadhaar card is not linked with a PAN card, then the PAN card will become invalid
 yani bank acount, debit card, credit card kaam nahin karenge, isliye is kanoon ko ansavaidhanik qaraar diya janaa chahie
 In the last hearing, the Central Government had said in the Supreme Court that the Aadhaar card is mandatory and those who are not deliberately making Aadhaar are committing a crime, but the Supreme Court had asked the Center that you cannot say that Aadhaar They are not committing crimes
 asaliyat main wo aadhaar kanoon ko chunauti de rahe hai or court main unki yachika par sunwaayee chal rahi he
 The Supreme Court asked the Center the question of whether the Aadhaar data leak has come
 is par centre ne supreme court main kaha ye data UIDAI se li nahin hua
 The center said that these data have been leaked from other government departments, who are having difficulty in keeping the Aadhaar data transparent and safe
 aadhaar data puri tarah surakshit he, kyonki ise UIDAI ne IT act ke tahat critical imphastracchar kii shrenee main rakhaa gaya he
 In the hearing on Thursday, the petitioner's lawyer Arvind Dattar said that the government is making step by step Aadhaar mandatory
 ye puri tarah asanvaidhanik he
 It violates the fundamental basis of the people, which gives the right to free trade in the country
 is kanoon ke tahat agar koi aadhaar card pan card ke saath nahin joda jayega to pan card avaidh ho jayega
 That is, bank accounts, debit cards, credit cards will not work, so this law should be declared unconstitutional
 pichhali sunwaayee main centre sarkaar ne supreme court main kaha tha ki aadhaar card anivaary he or jo log jaanboojhkar aadhaar nahin banavaa rahe wo ek tarah se aparaadh kar rahe hai, lekin supreme court ne centre ko tokaa tha ki aap ye nahin kah sakate ki jinhone aadhaar nahin banwaaya wo aparaadh kar rahe hai
 Actually, they are challenging the Aadhaar law and their petition is being heard in the court
 supreme court ne centre se poocha sawaal ki aadhaar data li kii khabar ai he

 centre ne kaha ki ye data duusare sarkari vibhaagon se li hua he, jinhen aadhaar data ke paardarshee rakhane or surakshit rakhane main dikkat ho rahi he

 When he did not return home even after the day of worship, the family started investigating

 Ravikesh's in-law is in the neighborhood of Chandeshwar

 He lodged a complaint against Ravikesh at the police station
 ravikesh par isliye andeh tha kyonki dedh saal pehle chandeshwar se uskaa jhgada hua tha
 Since then talks between the in-laws of Chandeshwar and Ravikesh were also closed
 lekin ghatana kii raat donon saath dekhe gaye jiske baad se vah laapata tha
 On the morning of 24 June, when Ramnarayan went to the Naurangia police along with the villagers, it was told that Ravikesh had been arrested
 graminon ke mutabik, police ne daawa kiya ki manor nadi ke bhootani pul ke paas chandeshwar kii laash gaade jane kii jaankaree ravikesh ne di he
 On this basis a large number of men and women gathered

 The police were confident of finding the next day, but the villagers were not sure
 dar tha ki ravikesh police kii mileebhagat se laash ko raat main gaayab kar degaa
 They were adamant on bringing the accused so that the corpse could be found at his place
 police ko ashanka thi ki use laane ke baad bheed uski hatya na kar den
 According to eyewitnesses, the police kept talking about bringing the accused, but instead of the accused, police from other police stations came there
 tab graminon se police kii tikhi bahes hone lagi
 He got angry and started stepping stones
 jawaab main police ne firing kar di
 Actually, the villagers did not trust the police as it took four days to file a missing report
 ramnarayan ne bataaya ki 18 june ko report darj karaane naurangiya thana jane par kaha gaya ki unka ghar valmikinagar thane main he, report vahiin darj hogi
 At the same time, the Valmikinagar police told to report the incident to Devtaha Naurangia police station
 dobaaraa naurangiya thanadhyaksh se do din baad milane par report darj kii gai
 This attitude led the villagers to suspect that the police had met Ravikesh and had been mobbing the case since the beginning

 piusiel ke netaa vinayak sen kii nichali adaalat ke faisle ke khilaaf yachika tathaa jamaanat arji par bilaspur hoicourt main sunwaayee puri ho gai tathaa court ne faisla surakshit rakh liya he
 The bench of Justice TP Sharma and Justice RL Jhanwar heard the High Court on the plea of human rights activist Vinayak Sen against life imprisonment for treason
 atirikt mahadhivaktaa kishor bhadudi ne rajya shashan kaa paksh rakhaa tathaa vinayak sen or piyush guha ko jamaanat nahin die jane kii maang kii
 Bhaduri argued that Vinayak Sen is a doctor of children, but till date he has not set up camps related to children's health in Naxal-affected areas of the state, while he was definitely interested in Naxal activities
 doctor sen ke ghar kii jab talaashi lee gai, tab unke ghar se naksali sahitya mili na ki chikitsakeey dastavej
 This proves that Sen has a connection with staunch Naxalites
 unhone kaha ki sen jail main narayan sanyaal se naksali gatividhiyon ke sambandh main milane jate the
 Treatment is an excuse
 bhadudi ne sen par rajdroh ke aarope ko sahi tehraate hue kaha ki yah kaha ja rahaa he ki jail main vinayak sen or narayan sanyaal ke bich baatcheet ke dauraan jailer vahaan maujuud rahata tha tathaa sabhi baaten hindi main hoti thim
 But the fact that Sen and Sanyal used to speak only in Hindi is not being embraced, as both are Bengali speakers
 bhadudi ne kaha ki pichley dinon pakade gaye kattar naksali gopanna ne police ke saamne maukhik rup se sweekaar kiya tha ki vah vinayak sen ko jaanata he
 The Additional Advocate General said about Piyush Guha that he says that Vinayak Sen and Narayan do not know Sanyal, who is baseless
 jab police ne guha ko giraftaar kiya tha, tab usase naksaliyon ke teen patr baraamad hue the
 It is being told that Piyush Guha is a Tendupatta businessman, while the police did not recover any documents related to Tendupatta business from Guha

 uri ke baad kai badi filmein relies hain, jaise total dhamal, luka jhuppi, gali boy
 But the impact of any of these films does not seem to affect Uri's earnings

 The story of the Uri film is based on the true incident of the 2016 surgical strike
 film ke vishay se ummid kii gai thi ki ye acchhee kamai karegi, lekin ye kisi ne nahin sochaa gaya tha ki 45 karod ke bajet par bani film 238 karod rupee kama legi
 The biggest thing is that Uri was not released on any holiday and weekend of the festival
 phir bhi film kii shandaar kamai chaunkaane vaali he
 Trade analyst Taran Adarsh has given information about Uri's statistics by tweeting

 Suit up
 Let's go for a take! posta post shared byvicky Kaushal (@ vickykaushal09) onfeb 1, 2019 at 6:22 am PST Compare Simba and Uri's earnings then the life time collection of Ranveer Singh's film released on 28 December is 240 crores
 vahiin uri mahaj 8 hafte main 238 karod tak aa gai he, is tarah jald hi simba kaa record todane ja rahi he
 There is a difference of ground in their budget
 simba 80 karod ke bajet main bani thi vahiin uri maatr 45 karod ke bajet main
 Compared in this way, Uri outweighs Simba on every aspect
 yahi nahin donon filmon kii style main bhi bahut antar he
 One film is a mass entertainer and the other is based on a true incident
 prakaash jha kii film 'jai ganga jal' main priyanka chopra kadak police adhikari ke kirdaar main hai
 It was quite challenging for him to balance his tough temperament and soft behavior like a normal woman while playing such a character
 jabapriyanka chopdase poocha gaya ki unhen abha maathur ke kirdaar ko nibhaane main sabase badi kya chunauti ai to unka jawaab tha, 'jab aap ek sakht mizaaj kirdaar nibhaa rahe hote hai or jab aap uniform main aate hai to ek aam mahila jaisaa vyavhaar banaae rakhana bahut mushkil hota he or yah baat mere liye behad jaruri thi
 Prakashji and i talked about how being a woman means a lot to me as a woman, but Abha Mathur is a police officer with her
 isliye yah kairactor bahut hatakar he
 In the film, Aabha is completely feminine even while doing Mathuraction
 'priyanka chopraor prakaash raaj starer film 'jai gangaajal' 4 march ko relies ho rahi he
 After the success of the story collection Neela Scarf, the new book 'mamma's Diary' by writer Anu Singh Chaudhary is coming

 You are the corner of my heart that i have hidden from the world
 har saal tumhen bataati to hum ki tum mere 6 saalon ke intjaar or duaon kaa fal the
 The greatest doctors of Delhi (yes, by the age of 25 years i had been treated by 13 big doctors of Delhi) Pandit, Maulvi, Pir Dargah, Gande Tawij, vrat-pooja
 
 
 sab kar chuki thi main
 Every doctor, every pundit would say the same thing - neither my planetary constellations had faults nor there was any deficiency in my or your father's body
 deree hoti, par santan sukh likhaa tha
 i tied the knot to him, and thought that you will definitely come soon
 din bitne lage
 Treatment and worship continued
 main bahut besabri se tumhaara intjaar karti rahi
 i started getting tired of myself, my life, my body
 khud se nafrat si ho gai thi
 i saw everyone having children nearby
 bevajaah aborshan ke liye jaati saheliyon ko dekhati or phir apni jindagi kaa suunaapan dekhati
 When sitting alone in her big car, she would see that the family of four people on the scooter was laughing and playing
 trephic signal par roj nae bacchon ko bheekh maangate hue dekhati or apane ghar angan ke suunepan ko dekhati
 i was surprised at the justice of the above, at his will
 kabhi roti thi
 Sometimes she used to curse him
 kabhi uske saath deal karti to kabhi aatmahatya karne kii sochati
 But in the hands of life and death
 uski marji kaa kabhi pataa nahin chalata
 Then one day, on September 21, 1995, when the whole world was shocked to see Ganesha drinking milk, on that day a greater surprise happened to me
 haa, tumhaare aane kii pehali aahat ai thi
 What a miracle! Seeing the news on TV at night, i was thinking, 'why is this Ganeshji drinking so much hue and cry? a bigger miracle has happened and the world is not even aware of it
 'ham kitne khush the! mujhe tumhaare aate hi pataa tha ki tum kaise dikhoge
 Exactly the same mischief as my father, the same fickleness whose stories i was tired of hearing
 maine soch liya tha ki khub dantoongi tumhen
 If half of the joy of motherhood is in seeing krishna-leela, then half of the happiness is in weeping itself by punishing the same Krishna
 meraa khaane kaa swaad bhi bilkul tumhaare papa jaise ho gaya tha
 Chilli Spices, Peppery Chaat Dumplings
 
 
 kuch nahin khaayi jaati thi mujhase
 But this will not work at all
 main tumse kahati
 It was important for both of you to be part of us
 thodaa mere jaisaa or thodaa apane papa jaisaa bananaa tha tumhen
 Say to you, take a hobby of reading and writing like me
 puri tarah papa jaise hue to main bhi sari umr haath jod kar principal ke offis main hi khadi rahuungi!jab pehali baar tumhaare dil kii dhadkan suni to meri dhadkan band ho gai khushi ke maare
 i could not believe my ears
 jab tumhen pehali baar ultrasound mashin par dekha to man kiya ki bas jaldi se meter down ho jaae
 May this day pass quickly so that i can see you with you in my arms
 pyaar kar sakuun
 i was mad for hours about the ultrasound report
 tumhaare liye kapade or khilone kharidne shuru kar die
 Started weaving dreams
 ghar main itani khushi thi ki lagata tha, khushiyon ne kai saalon kii bharpai karnaa tay kar liya he! paanchavaa maheenaa khatm hone ko tha, lekin mujhe lagata tha jaise samay chal hi nahin rahaa
 i would wait for a doctor's appointment to see you again
 sun sakuun
 How strange is the mother's heart too? If the child keeps on breathing inside, how can it be able to touch the hand, smell it? phir us raat achaanak jane kya hua
 i immediately come to know that you are in trouble
 meraa or tumhaara dard judaa hua jo tha
 We ran to the hospital in the middle of the night, the doctor heard your heartbeat, and that was the last time i heard you
 uske baad kii raat hamaare jivan kii sabase lambi or dukhad raat thi
 The next day, your grandmother and grandmother were talking slowly among themselves in the room
 ye soch kar ki shaayad mujhe abhi bhi hosh nahin aayaa
 That you be buried or shed
 panditji ko phone karke puch rahi thim donon, "praan pad gaye honge balak main, kya vidhi hogi?" aapas main baat kar rahi thim, "maa ko dikhaae yaa nahin?"maine behoshee kaa naatak hi thik samajha
 You didn't need to see me, i knew how you looked
 na tumhen vidaa karne kii himmat thi mujhamen
 Not till today
 kyonki ek maa ke liye ajanma bhi utana hi real or pyaara hota he
 Two years later your sister arrived
 par usase bhaiya or hamase betaa sunne ke liye tum vaapis nahin aae
 But in me you continued to live, growing up
 aaj tumhaara 18waan janmdin he aditya
 Today you would have been born to me


 Lazh hajhjh lajj if not this “my son” occupies a whole world in these two words
 tumhaari mamain isi kitaab ke chaptars likh rahi thafir
 When a very strange friend of mine sent this letter in my email
 kehane kii jarurat nahin ki khat us dard ko pakad paane yaa bayaan kar paane kii ek aanshik koshish bhar rahi hogi, jo dard pichley atharah saalon se wo ji rahi hogi
 The pain of losing the unborn child remains untold throughout the ages
 tha magar tha bhi nahin – ye aisa rishta hota he jise koi samajhane kii koshish kare bhi to kaise? nari deh rachati he, isliye nari man nashvarata ke prati darshanik nahin ho paata
 But within your skin, it comes to compromise gradually with this piercing pain like piercing teas
 jate-jate tumne aawaaj to di hogi
 i was sitting in front of a mother making such an agreement with life very beautifully
 ranchi kii musalasal baarishein us itvaar kaa swaad kirkira karne par amada thim
 But the mother in front of whom i was sitting, their laughter used to live in the room like a sunshine in the midst of the wet weather peeping from outside the window
 ham unke ghar-parivaar ke bare main baat kar rahe the
 i used to ask personal questions on a lively basis
 “hostel kyon chali gai thim padhane ke liye antee?”“phir apane bacchon ko bhi hostel bhej diya?”“teen bacchon ko paalate hue practice kaise kar rahi thim?”“are chhodie antee, aajkal kii heroine nayikaayen nahin hotin, item girl hoti hai bas
 “between our passersby, the point of something would open from somewhere, and somewhere it would go missing
 antee ke teen behad safal (or apane-apane peshey main bahut mashhoor) bacchon ke bare main hamane baat shuru kii to pataa nahin baat kahaan se kahaan pahunch gai
 
 
 "I had another daughter," Aunt's voice suddenly changed
 “meri donon betiyon se badi, or bete se choti
 "I keep quiet
" mujhe laga ki maine us darvaaze par khatkhatane kii gustaakhee kar di he, jis par bade-bade aksharon main likhaa he, “plis du note disturb
 The aunt did not wait for my response
 ve ek rau main bolti chali gayi
 “she was born after many years of marriage
 ham kanpur main rahete the tab
 He had just started walking
 betaa thodaa-sa hi bada tha usase, kareeb do saal
 Both children were still and playing at home
 bacchon ko nahalaane ke liye maine angan main garm pani rakhaa tha
 Voiced my neighbor from the side
 
 
 mujhe unka koi saamaan lautaanaa tha
 Seeing the children sleeping i came out to the door for two minutes
 
 
 ham baaten karne lage
 
 
 Me and a lady from the neighborhood
 
 
 or phir
 
 
 “amidst long silence and sob, it was not difficult for me to guess what would have happened in the meantime
 wo choti-si bacchee daudti hui angan main ai hogi, thik vahiin jahaan garm pani kii baaltee rakhi hogi
 As soon as i imagined what would have happened, i felt as if the cry stuck in my neck would now come out of the stomach with a twist
 itnaa bada aparadhbodh! ye itnaa bada dard tha ki takreeban tees saalon ke baad bhi ek maa us gam se nijaat nahin paa saki he, us khoi hui santan ke baad do kaabil betiyon ke paidaa ho jane ke baad bhi!“hamane bahut koshish kii
 My daughter was in Sadar Hospital
 sattar fisadi jal chuki thi
 i expected, but
 
 
 kitni takaleef hui hogi use
 To this day, it seems that my being a doctor is useless
 
 
 ,” antee ke chehre par wo gam phir se lahar banakar utarane laga tha
 What is this river of trouble that even the river of age cannot give it an edge? Even if the child suffers a bruise, a mother is most likely to curse herself - such that she has been entrusted with the responsibility of saving her child by fighting the entire task, along with the power of men
 chot lagate hi dard main jo pehla swar nikalataa he, wo ‘maa’ hota he
 Even after coming out of the body, the mother is unable to separate herself from her child's existence for many years
 phir apane bachche ko bahut lambii takaleef main dekhne or phir ek din kho dene kaa gam jehan se kab, kahaan utarataa hoga?main ek aisi maa ko bhi jaanati hum, jinaki ek santan kii berahami se hatya ho gai or duusari ne khudakushi kar lee
 i also know a mother who is very close to the responsibilities of her family throughout her life
 phir breast cancer kii shikaar apni jawan beti kii timaardaari kii or ab beti ke guzar jane ke baad uske do saal ke bete ko paal rahi hai
 We all must know such mothers, who lost their children due to some reason
 thi ek ladki, tejasvi gudgaanv gai thi main ek aisi hi ek or maa se milane
 i came to know this mother through a blog
 mujhe acchhee tarah yaad he ki maine purniyan se jender discrimination ke upar ek post likhi thi, or us par indian homemekar ke naam se ek blogar kaa coment aayaa tha
 Talking about e-mails, it was found that Indian Homemaker was actually the blog of Seema Rao, mother of Tejashwi Rao
 jin dinon bloging kaa daur abhi shuru hi hua tha, un dinon tejasvi naam kii ek behad zindadil ladki na sirf beficri or nidarta se virtual spes main apni baat kah rahi thi, balki apni pahchaan bhi bana rahi thi
 Tejashwi wrote a letter for his daughter on his blog
 jise wo ek din god lenaa chaahati thi
 In her post 'A letter to the future' she wrote to her future daughter: "I want you to know, that every day is a challenge, but that every time you walk out of that door, there will be someone waiting for you to get home to whom you can proudly display your battle wounds
 There will be people who’ll try to change you to suit their needs, but for each of these, know that there are others who’ll help you change to better yourself
 Learn to recognize the difference
 It took me ages


 you won’t always find people exactly like you, but no matter who you’re with, be yourself
 i want you to read to kill a mocking bird and watch Life is beautiful
 ”ye ek bhavi maa kaa apni bhavi beti ke liye khat tha
 This was a letter from one generation woman to another woman
 kamaal kii baat he ki tejasvi apni ajanmi beti ko jo kitaab or jo film dekhne ke liye kah rahi thi un donon main ek pita apane bacchon ko ek acha perent bananaa sikhaata he
 Tejaswi also had a future mother and a future father
 tejasvi hoti to samaaj ke liye, parivaar ke liye anmol hoti
 Would have been a good mother, a good parent
 11 agast 2010 ko dilli ke ek aspataal main dengue se jujhate hue tejasvi ne apni aakhri saansen leen
 Her death did not become national headlines simply because dengue was in the news then, but because a vivacious girl suddenly left
 tejasvi ke bare main likhane waalon ne tejasvi ko kai-kai baar, or bahut shiddat se yaad kiya
 Twenty days before his death, Tejashwi wrote on his blog: "when I'm old (one day) and lying in bed, knowing (" somehow ") that my time has come, I'll see my life flashing before my eyes
 ”is post ke saath ek video bhi tha, or tha chhuttiyon ke baad college ke khul jane kaa utsaah
 And then one day suddenly Tejaswi stopped writing, stopped breathing
 kya pataa isiu main ventilator par pade-pade use apni ankhon ke aage se guzarati hui apni thodi si zindagi dikhaai bhi di hogi yaa nahin
 After all, what is this pain medicine? There are many colors of grief
 or dukhon ko jhelane ke tareeke bhi ham apane-apane tareeke se ijad kar liya karte hai
 For those who have livelihood, and for those who want to live in any situation, 'grief', 'mourning' or 'sadness' is also the reason for living
 dukh ke lamhon main ham apane sabase kareeb, apane sabase shuddh, eemaandaar rup main hote hai
 Vulnerability (vulnerability) has its own pleasures
 tuutakar bikharane kaa shaur sabko nahin aata
 The one who comes, he adds himself back as fast
 tootna or phir khud ko sametanaa jeene kaa doosraa naam he
 Tejashwi's mother Seema did just that
 apni beti ke jane kaa gam seemaa ke liye kai or sari maanon ke saath judane kii vajah ban gaya
 Seema writes on her blog, winning every wish of Tejashwi that she had cherished in eighteen years of life
 main jab seemaa se milane gai thi tab tejasvi ko guzare teen baras ho chuke the
 Seema shifted to a new home with her family
 nae pardon, nai kalinon or jeene ke nae taur-tareekon ke bich seemaa apni puraani yaaden or puraane yakeen ko bachaane main juty hui thim
 The future daughter for whom Tejashwi wrote the letter, Seema brought that future daughter home with her
 ham donon jab tejasvi ke bare main baaten kar rahe the, us vaqt seemaa kii aath saal kii dattak beti skool gai thi
 But amidst the memories of Tejaswi, Seema's new responsibility, taken as a mother, was often dazzled by the morning dew
 tejasvi kaa zikr rah-rahakar abhi bhi aata he
 Tejashwi is still present on Seema's blog as it was four years ago
 lekin seemaa ke liye tejasvi or uske yakeen ko bachaae rakhana jeene kaa makasad ho gaya he, or gam se ubarne kaa rasta bhi
 i think of the border often
 tejasvi ke bare main bhi
 Life is never monotonous, so how will everything be happy in the family? If a family is the sum of different relationships and existence, then even a small movement in every relationship will spoil the family equation
 koi ek ghatana, koi ek haadasa parivaar ke sabhi sadasyon par asar daalata he
 Obviously, far more on a mother
 isliye agar ye maa kii jimmedaari he ki wo khud ko sambhalakar parivaar ko bikharane se bajaae to ek parivaar kaa bhi ye farz banataa he ki wo ek shoksantapt maa ko apane dukh se nijaat paane ke maukey de, use wo aazaadee de jisase maa apane bheetar kii takaliphen kisi na kisi tareeke se rachanaatmak hokar nikaal paae
 “it was an ointment for me to see patients
 main apana kaam kar rahi hoti thi to apane saath hue haadase ke bare main nahin sochati thi
 My work kept me crazy, so i used to work like crazy
 kabhi-kabhi sochati hum ki agar mere paas jane bachaa paane kaa thodaa-sa santosh nahin hota to main khud ko shaayad kabhi maaf nahin kar paati or pagal ho gai hoti,” doctor antee ne ek lambii gahari saans lekar kaha tha mujhase
 Doctor aunt was showing many black and white and colorful pictures on one wall of his house, like a child
 bacchon kii shaadi kii tasviren, unhen milane vaale aword samarohon kii tasviren, unke bacchon ke bachapan kii tasviren, chhuttiyon kii tasviren, hansi kii tasviren, khushi kii tasviren
 
 
 Pictures of moments in which there was a zest for life
 apane bacchon ke bare main baat karte hue unki hansi laut ai thi
 She wants to write a book on her life now, which her grandchildren can read
 “main apane gam ke bare main sochati hum or aas-paas dekhati hum ki mujhase bhi zyaada badakismat hai log
 There are so many problems in this world
 maa bananaa bhi ajeeb hota he
 You become sensitive to all the problems you might not have thought of before, "the mother who wrote her letter to her unborn son on her anniversary told me

 maamla rajdhani dilli ke lakshmi nagar thane kaa he
 Aakash's bike, a resident of East Delhi's Laxminagar area, was stolen on August 18, whose tahrir had already entered the sky
 kuch din baad akaash ko thane se phone aayaa ki uski bike mil gai jiske baad uskaa khushi kaa thikaana na rahaa
 When he saw the bike, he was standing in the police station in good condition
 police ne usko bataaya ki gaadi lene ke liye court se order laana hoga jiske baad use bike supurd kii jaaegi
 The victim Akash alleges that he was demanded for two and a half thousand rupees in this behalf
 usne 2000 police ko de bhi die ore vakil ke madhyam se court main bike supurdagee ke liye arji bhi di, lekin jaj ne jo kaha use sunakar akaash ke pairon tale se jameen khisak gai
 Giving information that Akash was stolen from the premises of the bike station, it was informed that an FIR has also been made again
 peedit akaash kaa kahana he ki jab police thane main hi koi cheez surakshit nahin to ilaake main kya haal hoga, iskaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Now the question arises that after how the vehicle was stolen from inside the police station, when they tried to talk to the police officers on this question, they were seen escaping
 gorkha janamukti morcha (jijeem) ke ugr andolankariyon or pulicermiyon ke bich hui jhadap main guuruuvaar ko 15 pulicekarmi ghayal ho gaye or paanch vaahanon ko aag ke hawaale kar diya gaya
 To stop the agitation, policemen who fired tear gas shells pelted stones at GJM agitators and set five of their vehicles on fire

 In addition, barricades were also broken

 To prevent this protest, the police released tear gas shells so that the protesters could be isolated
 virodh pradarshan ke chalate kai saare paryatak pahari ilaakon main fanse hue hai
 The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha demands that Nepali be taught as a language or to teach Hindi if needed, but the Gorkha Jan Mukti Morcha is completely against Mamta's decision

 in teen deshon ke dabaav ke maddenjar hi pakistan ne bhartiya wing commander abhinandan (IAL Pilot) ko do din baad hi bharat ko saunpane kii ghoshnaa kii he
 However, no formal statement has yet come from the Government of India on these efforts
 yah spasht he ki washington ne bharat or pakistan ke bich tanaav kam karne or payalat kii rihaai main ahm bhoomika nibhaai he
 Because just before Imran Khan's announcement, US President Donald Trump told the world media in Hanoi on Thursday that he had very good news from India and Pakistan
 unhone patrakaron ke sawaal ke jawaab main kaha tha ki ham bharat-pakistan ke tanaav ko kam karne kii koshishon main shaamil rahe hai or hamaare paas bharat or pakistan se kaaphi acchhee khabar he or ummid he ki jald donon deshon ke bich tanaav khatm honge
 He had said that i hope that the situation of tension between India and Pakistan is going to end now
 iske alaava, america kii bhoomika ko is tarah se bhi samajha ja saktaa he ki aisi report ai thi ki america videsh mantri mike pompiyo ne bhartiya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal se guuruuvaar kii subah kareeb 25 minute tak baatcheet kii thi
 Another important role played in indo-pak issue was the United Arab Emirates, which has now become an important ally of India
 sanyukt arab emirate ke crown prince mohammad bin jaayad al nahyaan ne guuruuvaar kii shaam main ek twit kiya, jiske mutabik unhone bhartiya pradhanmantri or pakistani pradhanmantri ko phone kiya or haal ke ghatnakramon se samajhadaari se nipatane ke liye samvaad or sanchaar ko praathamikta dene ke mahatv par bal diya tha
 At the same time, the third important country in this was Saudi Arabia, which publicly talked about helping to end the increased tension after the Pulwama terror attack
 saudi arab ke videsh maamalon ke rajya mantri adelle al jubir shuukravaar ko crown prince ke mahatvapurn sandesh ke saath islamabad ke liye udaan bharenge
 Incidentally, the Saudi envoy in India met Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 anya deshon main britain, france or rus bhi shaamil he, jinhone donon deshon ke bich tanaav ko khatm karne kii lagaataar koshish kii
 Not only this, these countries also brought a resolution in the UN Security Council to blacklist Jaish kingpin Masood Azhar
 bataa den ki bharat kii ore se bina kisi shart ke payalat abhinandan ko reeha karne kii kii baat kahi gai, jiske kuch samay baad pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ne shanti bhaavana ke tahat bhartiya payalat abhinandan kii rihaai kaa elaan kiya
 Pakistan will hand over the Wing Commander Abhinandan to India today via the Wagah border, to be taken by a delegation of the Government of India
 haalanki, abhi yah spasht nahin he ki ki pakistan abhinandan ko antarrashtriya red cross ko saunpega yaa bhartiya adhikariyon ko

 Even in those years when Shivinder Mohan Singh was responsible for running Fortis Healthcare, board meetings were held by his elder brother and company chairman Malvinder Mohan Singh
 vaais chairman shivinder ne board meetings main yaa saarvajanik rup se malvinder se kabhi koi asahmati nahin jataai
 So many people were shocked when Shivinder pleaded to sue Malvinder for alleged 'harassment and mismanagement' at the National Company Law Tribunal on 4 September
 lekin saaf shabdon main kaha jaae to is tanatani ke beej to kaaphi pehle pad chuke the
 The two brothers spent around Rs 22,500 crore
 ganvaa die or bharat ke sabase bade hospital chen fortis healthcare or bharat kii sabase badi gaiyr-banking vitt company railigare enterprijej kii milkiyat unke haath se phisal chuki he
 In June 2008, the two brothers Malvinder and Shivinder Singh had Rs 9,500 crore
 nakad the, jo unhen bharat kii sabase badi dawa company ranbaxy laboratories kii bikri se mili the
 But after eight years, one day it came when both were worth Rs 13,000 crore
 se adhik ke karj main duube the
 Sometimes the two brothers were issuing a joint statement, blaming Religare CEO Sunil Godhwani for this debt burden, expressing their trust and solidarity with each other; Then came one day when Shivinder was announcing that he had completely ended all his business relations with Malvinder
 ek roj, shivinder kathith utpeeda, kuprabandhan or jaalsaji ke liye malvinder or godhwani ke khilaaf rashtriya company kanoon tribunel chale gaye the
 Then one day, after mother Nimmi Singh appeals to resolve the matter together with the elders of the family, Shivinder withdraws the case from the Tribunal
 malvinder or shivinder singh ne i-mail dwaara bheje gaye saajha bayaan main kaha tha, ''karj chukaane ke sabhi sambhav prayaason ke baavjood aaj, hamane apane sabhi pramukh vyavsaayon jaise ki fortis, esarel or railigare par apana swaamitv kho diya he kyonki bainkon ke paas hamaare jo share girvee the, unhen jabt kiya ja chukaa he
 Now we have only nominal shares of these businesses
 ''donon bhaaiyon ne 22,500 karod ru
 And how it mattered such a huge business empire! It is an interesting story about the end of money-cracking, foolishness, blind faith first and now mutual trust
 is trikoniya kahani ke mukhya paatro main donon singh bhaaiyon ke saath, unke mamaa gurinder singh dhillon or unka parivaar or railigare ke purv siio sunil narayandas godhwani shaamil hai
 Dhillon — popularly known as 'babaji' or 'saint of Beas' —is the spiritual master of the influential Radhaswami Satsang Beas (RSSB), which has more than two million followers across the country and holds unexplored land
 aresasbi ke samathrya kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki iske lagbhag 5,000 kendron par sant samagam ke dauraan 50 se lekar 5,00,000 logon tak ko tehraane ke intjaam hai
 9,576 crore to the Singh brothers after selling Ranbaxy to daichi-sankyo of Japan in 2008
 mili the, jinamein se kareeb 2,000 karod ru
 Both were used to pay taxes and debts

 kaa nivesh railigare ko aage badhaane ke liye kiya gaya or 2,230 karod ru
 Was invested in Fortis
 lekin sabase mahatvapurn he ki 2,700 karod ru
 The Dhillon family were transferred to companies owned by Shabnam Dhillon, wife of Gurinder Dhillon, and companies of senior functionaries of the RSSB
 yah paisa ab tak singh bandhuon ko waapas nahin kiya gaya he
 Religare and Fortis were cash-strapped
 jaahir he, unki balance shit bahut shandaar thi
 Taking advantage of this, he took a huge loan and went on spending wildly
 is bich, dhillon or aresasbi ke sahyogiyon ne real estate kshetra main kadam rakhaa
 In the late 2000s the sector was making extraordinary returns
 real estate main zyada se zyada kharidari ke liye ve 12-14 fisadi ke oonche byaaj par karj lekar paise lagaate chale gaye
 All this eventually proved to be very fatal for him
 mandi kii maar padi to railigare or fortis ne apane vistaar ke dauraan jo bade karj liye the, use chukaane main paseene chhootane lage
 To save both their flagships, the Singh brothers were forced to withdraw money from their reserves
 lekin vah nahin ho sakaa
 The country's economy collapsed due to the recession
 keemton main baari giravat ke kaaran real estate kshetra aundhe munh gira
 Neither Dhillon nor the Singh brothers could recover from this hit
 is bare main jaanane ke liye dhillon or singh bandhu donon ko mail bheje gaye lekin kisi ne koi jawaab nahin diya
 The Singh brothers were then caught in a vicious cycle of mortgaging the assets and equity of the group companies for loans to pay back past liabilities
 kai baar to unhone group kii companiyon ke paise ko nijee holding companiyon ke dayitvon kaa bhugtan karne main bhi istemaal kar liya
 At present, regulatory authorities are investigating those cases
 gambhir dhokhadhadi jaanch karyaalay or sebi donon, singh bandhuon ke netritv main kathith vittiya aniyamittaaon kii jaanch kar rahe hai
 Apart from this, he received Rs 473 crore from the company without any approval
 ke hastantaran ke aaropon kii jaanch bhi chal rahi he
 The Singh brothers have stated that the money was given to the company which was not a related party at the time of transfer of the money, but was later acquired by the promoters
 isliye yah ek sambandhit party ke lenden kaa hi maamla ho gaya he
 Another transaction involving his company was found suspicious in 2016 when the Reserve Bank of India lent Religare's lending firm, Religare Finvest, Rs 1,200 crore
 kaa rin bina aavashyak saavdhaanee barte baantne kii koshish par roak lagaai thi
 According to the records of the Registrar of Companies (ROC), between 2008 and 2016, the group holding companies RHC Holding and Oscar Investment raised funds worth Rs 15,276 crore with various banks and financial institutions to raise funds
 tak kii achal sampattiyaan or share girvee rakh die
 12,800 crore from mortgage of RHC alone (some of which may be for arranging money to repay previous debts) in early November 2010
 tak jode gaye
 When he tried to repay the loan by selling his share in the group companies, the dai sankyo were tried several times through court orders in the path of the Singh brothers' efforts
 daichi court chali gai or vahaan usne sabit kiya ki donon bhaaiyon ke paas us madhyasthata aadesh ke evaj main 50 karod dollar kaa bhugtan karne ke liye paryaapt sampattiyaan thim, jo usne ranbaxy kii bikri ke dauraan singh bandhuon dwaara mahatvapurn jaankariyaan chupaane ke liye daayar ek yachika main jeeta tha
 That order is currently reserved with an appellate court in Singapore
 karj chukaane ke liye paryaapt dhan kaa prabandh karne main asamarth rahane par group kii companiyon main singh bandhuon kii jo equity holding bainkon ke paas girvee thi, use udhaardaataaon ne jabt kara liya
 Fortis and Religare earlier had their share of 63 per cent and 72 per cent respectively, which today reduced to just 0
 6 pratishat or 1
 5 percent
 donon companiyon par se singh bandhuon ke swaamitv kaa ant ho gaya or unhone farvari 2018 main donon fermon se istipha de diya
 The Singh brothers have often claimed that both NBFC Religare and their family holding companies were operated and managed by their trusted Sunil Godhwani
 shivinder or malvinder ne i-mail dwaara bheji pratikriya main kaha ki ''godhwani ne apni pojishan kaa phayda uthaakar hamen dhokhe main rakhaa or aise bahut se lenden kiye jiske kaaran 2016 tak hamaara group karj ke boj tale dab gaya
 However, sources close to Godhwani reveal that he had no formal role in the holding companies and that the two brothers knew everything well because they had signed all the transactions
 godhwani ke paas bhi is maamle se jude sawaal vistaar se bheje gaye the lekin unhone koi jawaab nahin diya
 One truth is that both Fortis and Religare are also guilty of reckless expansion efforts by taking advantage of the initial cash from the sale of Ranbaxy
 masalan, railigare ne ek vaishvik vittiya powerhouse banane kaa lakshya nirdhaarit kiya or udhaar dene (railigare finvest), puunji bazaar (railigare securities), dhan prabandhan (railigare velth management), parisampatti prabandhan, beemaa, houseing lone ke saath-saath camodity ke kshetra main teji se paanv pasaarne shuru kiye
 Although the money invested in most of the businesses has sunk, Religare was most hit by its subsidiaries Religare Capital Markets and Ligare Aviation (run by Godhwani's brother Sanjay)
 yahaan tak ki fortis healthcare, jiskaa sanchaalan singh bandhu karte the, usne bhi swasthya seva ke kshetra main vaishvik khilaadi hone kaa lakshya tay kiya tha
 It expanded to Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, Vietnam and Dubai, with funding for the acquisition of over $ 1 billion
 malvinder ne desh ke baahar ke vyapaar ke prabandhan ke liye apana base singapore main shift kar liya tha
 In 2010, the Singh brothers became embroiled in a takeover battle with Malaysia's sovereign fund treasurer for the acquisition of Singapore's Parkway Hospitals
 antat singh bandhuon ko peeche hatana padaa or parkway main apni hissedari khajaana ko bechni padi
