 The Election Commission has categorically refused to disclose the dissent note of its Commissioner Ashok Lavasa
 ayog ne soochna ke adhikaar kanoon ke tahat maangi gai is jaankaree ko dene se manaa kar diya he
 These dissent notes of Election Commissioner Ashok Lavasa are linked to the election speeches of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan piem modi ke kuch bhaashanon par kathith taur par adarsh aachaar samhita ke ulanghan kaa aarope laga tha
 The Election Commission said that it was allowed to not give any information that could endanger the life or physical safety of a person
 pune ke artiai activist vihaar dhurve ne chunaav ayog se ashok lavasa ke asahamit note kii maang kii thi
 The Election Commission has rejected this demand
 bataa den ki loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan piem narendra modi ke kai bhaashanon par aachaar samhita ke ulanghan kaa aarope laga tha
 PM Modi gave these speeches in Wardha on 1 April, in Latur on 9 April, in Patan and Barmer on 21 April and in Varanasi on 25 April
 piem modi par lage aachaar samhita ulanghan ke aaropon par haalanki chunaav ayog ne clin chit di thi, lekin in faislon par chunaav ayukta ashok lavasa ne asahmati jataai thi
 In the three-member Election Commission, Sunil Arora has the responsibility of the Chief Election Commissioner while two other commissioners are Ashok Lavasa and Sushil Chandra
 chunaav ayog ne artiai act kii dhara 8(1)(g) kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki aisi soochnaaon ko saarvajanik nahin kiya ja saktaa he jisase kisi vyakti kii jaan yaa shaareerik suraksha khatre main pad jaae, yaa phir soochna ke strot kii pahchaan ho yaa phir kanoon-pravartan yaa suraksha uddeshyon ke liye di gai sahaayta khatre main pad jaae
 Dhurve also sought information about the procedure adopted by the Election Commission for giving clean chit to the PM and the decisions made by the Commission
 chunaav ayog ne in soochnaaon ko bhi dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 It is believed that Ashok Lavasa objected to PM Modi and Amit Shah being repeatedly given a clean chit
 chunaav ayog ne jab ashok lavasa ke asahmati note ko apane aadesh main shaamil nahin kiya to aachaar samhita ulanghan ke maamalon se ashok lavasa ne khud ko alag kar liya tha
 After this, the Election Commission had said that dissent note and minority opinion will remain part of the record, but they will not be made public

 You know this news of a Major massacred the wife of another Major on the street of Delhi
 par wo vajah kya thi jisaki vajah se major nikhil ne shailaja kaa katl kiya? kya ye katl achaanak gusse ke alam main ho gaya yaa phir major katl karne ke iraade se hi ghar se niklaa tha? to aaie in saare sawaalon ke saath-saath aapako is sawaal kaa bhi jawaab dete hai ki aakhir major nikhil ne shailaja kaa katl kyon kiya
 Why did Major Nikhil kill Shailaja? Is that why Shailaja wanted to get rid of Nikhil? Or did Nikhil want to get rid of Shailaja? Why did there be a fight between Nikhil and Shailaja on the afternoon of 23 June? Did Nikhil plan the murder in advance? Why did Nikhil bring two knives to meet Shailaja? Was the two scheduled to meet on June 23? After all, what is the truth of Nikhil and Shailaja's relationship? It is said that there is a motive behind any murder
 ek baar makasad zaahir ho jaae to phir cese aasaani se sulajh jaataa he
 Both the murderer and Maktool are in this case
 par dikkat ye he ki shailaja ke katl ko lekar makasad ek nahin balki do-do bataae ja rahe hai
 This is the reason that despite the case being clear like a mirror, the police is not saying anything about the claim of Shailaja's murder
 shailaja ke katlke makasad ko samajhane ke liye cese se judi kuch chijen samajhnaa jaruri he
 During interrogation of the police, Major Nikhil is repeatedly saying that he had befriended Shailaja through Facebook in 2015, three years ago
 tab shailaja ne bataaya tha ki uskaa pati bank me kaam karata he
 After this, during the posting in Dimapur, he met Shailaja and then friendship
 jabaki shailaja ke pati major amit kaa kahana he ki wo major nikhil ko sirf chah maheene se jaanate hai
 Which means Shailaja kept Nikhil's truth hidden from Amit for two and a half years? Shailaja did not tell Nikhil about his friendship with Amit
 magar kyon?major amit or shailaja ke ghar vaale lagaataar kah rahe hai ki nikhil shailaja kaa peechha kiya karata tha or use tang karata tha
 Apart from this, there was no relationship between the two
 jabaki police kii poochtacha main major nikhil lagaataar yahi kah rahaa he ki shailaja ke peeche wo nahin balki shailaja uske peeche padi thi
 She wanted to marry him
 haalanki police kaa kahana he ki ye nikhil kaa drama bhi ho saktaa he
 Since Shailaja is no longer in this world, Nikhil's claim cannot be confirmed
 saath hi shailaja par sara ilzaam daal kar ye nikhil kii khud ko bachaane kii koshish bhi ho sakati he
 But according to police sources it is so clear that Major Nikhil and Shailaja used to keep in touch with each other over phone and whatsapp
 bakaul police sirf pichley saat maheene main hi shailaja or nikhil ne ek-duusare ko kareeb 3300 kol or 1500 massej kiye the
 Then suddenly what happened is that Nikhil killed Shailaja
 police sutron kii maane to kahani main twist pichley saal disambar main aayaa
 When Major Amit was transferred to Delhi and he shifted to Delhi from Dimapur with Shailaja
 dilli aane ke baad shailaja amritsar chali gai thi
 Shailaja's family lives in Amritsar
 is bich chaar june ko beemaari kaa bahaanaa banaakar major nikhil bhi dimapur se dilli aa gaya
 Nikhil's wife lives in the Saket area of delhi
 dilli aane ke baad june main do baar nikhil amritsar shailaja se milane gaya
 During interrogation, Nikhil told the police that he had a quarrel with Shailaja again during a second meeting at a mall in Amritsar and that was when Shailaja was murdered for the first time
 23 june kii subah bhi nikhil or shailaja ke bich whatsap par baat hui or donon ne army ke base hospital main milane kaa faisla kiya
 Both of them got out of the hospital in Nikhil's car and then stayed in the car for about 45 minutes
 is dauraan donon main lagaataar jhagada ho rahaa tha
 According to police sources, Nikhil had already decided that if Shailaja was adamant on his word, he would kill him
 or usne thik yahi kiya bhi
 Nikhil first stabbed Shailaja's throat with the knife he brought and then threw Shailaja out of the car and ran out of his car, trampling him
 is tarah se ye mohabbat kii kahani katl par jaakar khatm ho gai

 Used to write a little or soch samajhakar bolte the
 Now this sequence is reversed
 to kya karen
 How to get the order back

 Writing demands to stop and think
 ye aapse poochta he ki aapke ghar main sone kaa cameraa, nahaane kaa cameraa he to phir kitabon kaa cameraa kyon nahin
 Wants to know aakhri baar aapane apni jeb se kisi kitaab ke liye kab rakam nikaali
 When swiped the card

 Or when was the last time you read the poem and heard it on youtube and Facebook
 aisa nahin ki ham samajhate nahin
 It is not that we do not appreciate
 bas wo push
 i do not see that effort
 koshish ho iske liye ek badi koshish kar rahaa he aaj tak
 This accusation often appears on mainstream media that they do nothing for literature and culture
 badlaav kii shuruyaat ho chuki he
 Through this festival till date

 Numbers are quickly understood, so they explain in five points
 1
 Kedarnath Singh, the poet of love, met the great personalities of literature

 Those who wrote the immortal love poem become few

 The celebrities of cinema who create jokes and songs for us till today believe that cinema is doing the most work of creating language for the society

 When Crisis situation in a canteen is a statement from the dialog of a film
 koun jaanata he? sab jaanate hai
 But old people of literature believe less
 ham maanate hai, isliye amar dialog likhane vaale, gane likhane vaale
 Are gathering here with people writing ads
 sahitya aaj tak main aapaki mulaakaat hogi javed akhtar se
 i have a mother who is old
 dil chahta he bhi pichhali peedi ke hisse aayaa
 The new generation is chanting the mantra of Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara
 to jinda ho tum kar rahi he
 The common thread among these is Javed aka Jadoo
 anuraag kashyap
 Whose films, whose followers are crazy
 or apni deewangi main mast hai
 These are all residents of a different world
 anuraag bataaenge
 What is the language of love, power and money in North India
 muhaavarey kya hai
 How cinema gets raw material from people
 takat paata he
 Receives freshness jis kavi kii kalpana main jindagi ho prem geet likhane vaale piyush mishra honge
 Cold means Prasoon Joshi who writes Coca Cola
 tanu or manu ko pehali or riternas yani duusari main bol dene vaale geetkaar rajasekhar honge
 Raj was the leader of Nitish Kumar's political campaign
 bihar main bahaar he likhakar

 brallep main mili dard kaa ehsaas vahi insaan jaanata he jisane isaki pidaa sahi ho
 People often confirm their intention to waste after a breakup
 unhen lagata he ki unki jindagi se jane vaala shaks shaayad ab kabhi waapas nahin lautega
 Whereas in fact many times things fall in your favor
 agar aap bhi brallep ke baad dobaaraa packp karnaa chaahate hai to aapako kuch chijen dhyaan main rakhni hongi
 Be patient in every situation - It is very important to be patient after your breakup
 aap shaayad nahin jaanate ki brallep ke dard main jitna aap tadap rahe hai, utana hi bekaraar saamne vaala vyakti bhi ho saktaa he
 In such a situation, there are many chances of withdrawal from the other side
 isliye khud par dhairya rakhkar sahi vakt aane kaa intjaar karen
 Do not post on social media - there is no doubt that people often resort to the shoulders of others to share their pain
 aise main kai baar to log apane brallep kaa states tak soshal media par daal dete hai
 This can make the person in front of him more angry and this also reduces the chances of him returning
 export se len salaah-aksar brallep ke baad log depressant main chale jate hai
 Therefore it becomes necessary to seek the help of experts
 export kii salaah se naa sirf aapako apane ateet se baahar nikalne main madad milti he balki aage kii jindagi ke bare main bhi sochane ke liye kaaphi acha hota he
 Stop Stocking - By unnecessarily stocking on social media after a breakup, you can remove them even more from yourself
 behatar hoga ki kuch dinon tak khud ko soshal media plateform se dur rakhen
 On social media, you can get a response from the other side after not being active

 India, who reached a respectable score with a century partnership played in the odd circumstances of Suresh Raina and Harbhajan Singh , succeeded in giving the first blow to West Indies on the opening day of the first Test cricket match 
 bharat ke chotii ke chah ballebaaj 85 ran par pavilion laut gayi the
 Raina (82) and Harbhajan (70) put together a very useful 146-run partnership for the seventh wicket in such a delicate moment that the Indian team, who came out to bat first after winning the toss, were able to score 246 runs
 westeindies ne behad satark shuruyaat kii or shaam ke satr main 20 over ke khel main wicket bachaaye rakhane ko hi tarjeeh di
 He had scored 34 runs for one wicket by the end of the day's play
 is tarah se vah abhi bharat se 212 ran peeche he
 Then opener Adrian Barath was on 26 and Ramnaresh Sarwan was on two
 bharat kii taraf se ekmaatr wicket ishanth sharma ne liya
 Earlier, with the deadly bowling of fast bowler Ravi Rampal (three wickets for 59 runs) and leg-spinner Debendra Bishu (three wickets for 75 runs), Raina and Harbhajan showed aggressive attitude when the West Indies team dominated the match
 iskaa andaja isse lag saktaa he ki raina ne apni pari main 15 chauke jabaki harbhajan ne das chauke or ek chakka lagaaya
 The partnership was broken soon after tea by Fidel Edwards, who took four wickets for 56 runs in the match
 iske baad bhartiya pari simtane main der nahin lagi
 His last four wickets fell within 15 runs
 apana pehla test khel rahe kohli ne bhi chauke se shuruyaat kii lekin lunch se thik pehle edwards kii aaf stump se baahar jaati gend par unhone wicketiper carlton bow ko kaich diya
 Dravid hit two fours on Bishu early in the second season but he also caught a catch in the slip like Laxman on the last ball of the same over
 agle over main is leg spinner kii uthati gend dhoni ke balle ke upari hisse se lagakar gali main simons ke paas pahunch gayi
 Raina and Harbhajan adopted a counter-attack strategy in which they also succeeded
 in donon ne bishu ko nishane par rakhaa
 Harbhajan was playing more aggressively and he gave proof of three fours in one over of Rampal
 harbhajan ne keval 45 gend par test maichon main apana nauvaan or westeindies ke khilaaf pehla ardhashatak puraa kiya
 Raina then sent Sammy's consecutive ball across the boundary line to complete his third Test half-century
 in donon ne is bich bharat kii taraf se sabina park par saatven wicket ke liye sabase badi saajhedaari nibhaai
 Harbhajan then hit the first six of the innings on Bishu
 edwards ne tisare satr ke shuru se hi harbhajan par short pich gendon kii bambaari kii
 Harbhajan hooked one such ball and bounced towards deep square leg which Bishu converted into a catch with a great effort
 iske baad praveen kumaar (4) or amit mishra (6) bhi edwards ke shikaar bane
 Raina, meanwhile, also got his life back, but he tossed Rampal into the air and Bishu made no mistake in taking his third catch of the innings
 bharat ke 246 ran ke jawaab main pehle din kaa khel samaapt hone tak westeindies ne ek wicket par 34 ran banaaye
 The West Indies are still 212 runs behind India in this way

 kaleem ke tabadatod shats se jeet paas aane lagi thi ki tabhi raaj shrivastav ne ek behtareen kaich lapak kar match main jonpur uniwarsity ko waapas laa diya
 a few wickets of Aligarh fell in the final overs, but Aligarh University opened the winning account
 tippaniyan Yasir Kalim played an important role in this victory of Aligarh University
 unhone 42 gendon par 48 ran banaae
 Kalim hit four fours and two sixes in this innings
 unki pari se aligarh muslim uniwarsity ko bhale jeet mili ho

 Everyone is eyeing this player of Veer Bahadur Singh University
 shanivaar ko bhi inhone half sechuri jamaai thi lekin team haar gai or ravivaar ko bhi inkaa joardaar shatak team ke kaam nahin aayaa
 Aligarh had a very poor start
 anuj gupta ne pehle hi over main kataaria ko clin bold kar diya
 After this, Yasir Kaleem and Rohit Shaini took over Aligarh's innings
 donon ne dekhte-dekhte 56 ran jod die
 But here there was a slight tussle between Rohit Saini and Yasir Kaleem and Rohit Saini was run out
 yasir kaleem ne aligarh ko mukaable main banaae rakhaa
 The victory was coming to an end with Kalim's rambling shots when Raj Srivastava took a great catch and brought Jaunpur University back in the match
 antim overon main aligarh ke kuch wicket jarur gire lekin aligarh uniwarsity ne jeet kaa khaataa khol liya
 The comments aligarh uniwarsity kii is jeet main yasir kaleem kaa ahm yogadan rahaa
 He scored 48 runs off 42 balls
 kaleem ne apni is pari main chaar chauke or do chakke lagaae
 His innings may have won the Aligarh Muslim University


 but the real superstar of the match will be called Praveen Dubey whose century innings failed
 vir bahadoor singh uniwarsity ke is khilaadi par sabaki nazren tiki hai
 On Saturday too, he scored half-century but the team lost and his strong century on Sunday also did not work for the team

 December 1, Mukesh Ambani made another announcement with the extension of Jio's welcome offer
 unhone kaha ki company aadhaar card besd micro atm lagaaegi jiske jariye log paise nikaal sakenge
 For this, the company will enter into agreements with merchants and give them the service of Jio Money
 kya micro atm or kaise aapke liye yah phydemand sabit ho saktaa he
 In a place where there is no availability of ATM, the bank employees take point of sale machines and provide micro ATM service
 haalanki iske jariye zyada nagad nahin die ja sakate, lekin maujuuda daur main yah kai samasyaon kaa samaadhaan he
 These can be done through micro atms - e-kyc based savings accounts can be opened
 - cash jamaa kiye ja sakate hai
 - Cache can be withdrawn
 - fund trasafar bhi kiye ja sakate hai
 - You can also get information about account balance
 aise kaam karte hai micro atmal main shopping karne ke dauraan aapane marchent ke paas card swip karne vaali mashin dekhi hi hogi jise point of cell kaha jaataa he
 Micro atms are also like that
 bank ke karmchaaree ise lekar kisi ek jagah baithte hai jahaan ja kar aapako apana aadhaar card dikhaanaa hota he
 Here your fingerprint scan is done for biometric authentication
 othentication safal hone par ek raseed milti he or wo karmchaaree aapako paise detaa he
 After the transaction, its information is available on your mobile number
 fingerprint ke alaava agar aapke paas debit card he to aap use yahaan swip kara kar bhi tranjaction kar sakate hai
 However, it depends on which bank the point of sale machine is from
 alag alag bank apane tareeke se karte hai
 To open a bank account, you also have to provide fingerprint with your information
 aadhaar se judi jaankariyaan is mashin main khud se aa jaati hai
 In the current era, efforts are being made to have maximum use of fingerprint in banking
 iske tahat cash jamaa karne se lekar nikasi tak kiye ja sakate hai
 Talking about Jio Micro ATM, Reliance Industries Limited Chairman Mukesh Ambani said, "customers will pay from Jio Money Wallet linked to their bank account and merchants will receive them through Jio Money Merchant App
 paise sidhe martent ke bank acount main jayega'
 In the coming days it is possible that Reliance Jio will have more micro atms than atms in the country, as the company has already opened as many e-kyc stores as the number of atms

 Let us tell you that SP and BSP have not included Congress in their organization yet
 iske baad se congress ne bhi isaki parvaah na karte hue uttar pradesh kii sabhi 80 siton par akele ladane kar diya

 Chief Justice of India TS Thakur has expressed disappointment over the appointment of judges in PM Modi's speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort
 sijeai ne kaha ki hamane popular prime ministar kaa bhaashan dedh ghanta suna or lau ministar sahab kaa bhi suna, main ye ummid kar rahaa tha ki jajon kii niyukti ke bare main baat hogi
 The Chief Justice said that in the time of the British, the trial would have been decided in ten years
 wo ab nahin ho rahaa
 Now the cases have increased so much, the cases have increased and the expectations of the people have also increased
 bahut mushkil ho rahaa hai, isliye maine baar-baar guzarish kii hai ki jaraa is or bhi tavajjo dijie
 Today we talk in Hindustani, Chief Justice of India has already raised the issue of appointment of judges in front of PM Modi
 apane bhaashan kii shuruuaat main unhone kaha ki mere saare ajij dost jo mujhase pehle bole, wo sab angraji me bole
 i think today is at least such a day, it is good when we talk in Hindustani
 15 agast kii apni ahmiyatcheef justise ne kaha ki main ye maanata hum ki jo bhi tyohaar manaaya jaataa hai, uski apni ek ahmiyat hoti he
 The day of August 15 also has its own specialty
 hamen us ahmiyat ko kamjor nahin karnaa chahie
 It is a day to remember the soldiers of freedom who sacrificed, the tortures of the prison are right
 qurbaani naa bhulenties thakur ne kaha ki aapako yaad hai, 1948 jabpakistanka hamalaa hua, hajaaron log qurbaan hue, kashmir ko aaazaad rakhane ke liye
 Sacrificed a lot
 65,71, kargil ke yudd main qurbaani di
 Even today, where there is extremism, our military and paramilitary soldiers are also engaged, they should not be forgotten
 garibi or berogari par chif justise1947 main hamaari aabaadi 32 karod thi

 kareeb ek tihaai log garibi rekha ke neeche the
 Today our population has grown to 125 crores
 vahi 10 karod kii aabaadi 40 karod ke paas ho gai he
 Just pay attention to them too, but you have also drawn the poverty line such that the person earning 26 rupees in the village and 32 rupees in the city goes above the poverty line
 ek badi chunauti ye he ki kya ham 70 saal baad garibi ko hataa paae hai
 Today there is a problem of employment
 aaj agar main supreme court main chaparasi ke liye vaikency duun to post graduate bhi applai karte hai
 Now there is no hesitation in saying: CJI CJI said that i speak out of court and inside the court very impatiently, because i feel that the highest level of my life, i have reached there
 isse aage mujhe kahin nahi janaa, isliye mujhe kisi cheez kii pareshaani nahin he or na hi koi hichak he
 The right thing will touch your heart and this is my strength too

 Arranged for hospital immediately - on way to meet bereaved family! shivasena ke varisht netaa manohar joshi ne daawa kiya ki rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) adhyaksh sharad pavaar maharashtra main pichley vidhansabha chunaav main shivasena ke saath gathbandhan ke liye taiyaar ho gaye the
 But later Pawar retreated due to some reasons
 joshi ne kaha ki unhen yah yaad nahin he ki maamle main pahal kisne kii thi
 Former Lok Sabha Speaker Joshi said, "in the 2009 assembly elections, Pawar had expressed his desire to have an alliance with the Shiv Sena
 ' yah puche jane par ki gathbandhan ke bare main pahal kisne kii thi, joshi ne kaha ki philhal vah yah yaad nahin kar paa rahe hai
 He said, 'uddhavji asked me to talk with Pawar and i did
 ' purv mukhyamantri ne bataaya ki baad main pavaar gathbandhan se peeche hat gaye or vah nahin jaanate ki aisa kyon hua
 On the other hand, Shiv Sena has rejected Joshi's claim
 shivasena ke varisht netaa subhash desai ne samvaadadaataaon se baat karte hue kaha ki uddhav ne is bare main sochaa tak nahin tha
 He said, 'the issue is old and Uddhav Thackeray did not even think on this side
 ' yah puche jane par ki kya bhavishya main is tarah kaa gathbandhan sambhav he, desai ne kaha, 'keval joshi bhavishya ke bare main purvanumaan laga sakate hai
 How will i talk about this? ''joshi party main jagah bananaa chaahate hai'joshi ke daawey par ensipi pravaktaa nawab malik ne kaha ki shivasena main joshi ke liye jagah nahin he
 The party refused to give him Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha tickets
 malik ne kaha, 'vah is tarah kii bebuniyadi baaten kar party main apane liye jagah banane kii khatir prayasarat hai
 Significantly, prior to Joshi's revelations, senior Shiv sena-bjp leaders Uddhav Thackeray and Gopinath Munde had said that Pawar wanted to join the NDA
 munde ne kaha tha, 'agar kisi ko kisi baat kaa intjaar he to vah khud pavaar hai or vah endie main shaamil hone ke liye intjaar kar rahe hai
 This statement by the BJP leader added to the controversy that started with Uddhav Thackeray's claim that Pawar could not join the NDA due to his opposition
 munde ne kaha tha ki pavaar ne endie netaaon se sampark kiya tha
 Munde said, 'I spoke to Uddhav and then to other alliance partners in Maharashtra about this
 ham sabhi ne tay kiya ki ham sharad pavaar or unki ensipi ko endie main shaamil nahin hone denge
 ' landan main shahar cameyarka virodh kar rahe logon ne pilablunudaaya
 Balloon was given the shape of mayor and was also dressed in a yellow bikini

 According to the language, the 29-foot-tall controversial bikini-clad balloon of Mayor Sadiq Khan in London blew up from Parliament Square on Saturday
 is gubaare kii udaan ke liye kareeb 3,400 logon ne 58,182 pound daan die the
 The aim is to get Khan out of power in the 2020 elections
 aayojakon kaa kahana he ki britain kii rajdhani main vah aparaadh ko kam karne main naakaam rahe hai
 The crowdfunding page of the 'make London Safe Again' campaign said - 'baby Trump' balloon was allowed to fly from there during US President Donald Trump's visit to London
 aaie ab ‘baby khan’ ke gubaare ko udaayen or dekhen ki kya abhivyakti kii swatantraaa sabake liye he
 The page said, "the level of crime reached a new level during the tenure of Sadiq Khan
 landan main log surakshit mahasoos nahin karte or ve surakshit hai bhi nahin
 There have been 81 murders this year
 khan ko baahar karen
 Reacting to the matter, Khan said, "if people want to spend their Saturday watching me wearing a yellow bikini, they are welcome to do so

 In a March episode of Kumkum Bhagya, Purab leaves for Mehra House with a gift for Abhi but Nikhil stumbles off the truck and injures Purab
 ghayal pade purab se nikhil kahata he ki abhi or pragna ko milaane main vah kabhi safal nahin ho paaegaa
 He breaks the east's gift with legs and goes from there
 duusari taraf pragna purab ke nahin aane se pareshaan hoti he ki uske aae bina haldi kii rasm kaise cancil hogi
 Abhi gets upset seeing Pragya at the same time
 haldi kii rasm ke dauraan kuch aisa hota he ki haldi ke bartan gir jate hai or tanu kii haldi pragna par gir jaati he, vahiin abhi par bhi haldi gir jaati he
 Pragya goes to the room to clean the turmeric, Abhi reaches there after her
 pragna abhi ke man kii baaten samaj jaati he, abhi usase kahata he ki aisa kaise ho saktaa he to pragna kahati he ki vah uske man kii baat sun sakati he kyonki vah uski best friend he
 By telling Pragya to close his eyes, he thinks in his own mind that he should ask Pragya about his heart
 kuch der baad abhi kii aankh main kachra chalaa jaataa he jise nikaalane main pragna uski madad karti he
 After this Abhi cleans the turmeric of Pragya's face, during which both spend some good moments with each other
 tippaniyan Householders on the other hand discuss that the pair comes from above
 ve kehete hai ki jo jaisaa hota he uske saath vaisaa hi hota he
 Mithali says that the turmeric has started with Pragya, now whom will Abhi marry, Pragya or Tanu
 is par aalia bhadak jaati he or unhen chup rahane ke liye kahati he
 At this, grandmother scolds him that everything happens with the wishes of the above, he should be careful or else something similar will happen in the marriage too
 kal ke episod main ham dekhenge ki abhi gharavaalon ko bataata he ki kisi kaa phone aayaa tha ki purab kaa accident ho gaya he or vah aspataal main hai
 Pragya and the rest of the family go to the hospital to see the east, but Alia suspects Tanu that she is the one who attacked East
 pragna haldi saaf karne kamare main jaati he, uske peeche-peeche abhi vahaan pahunch jaataa he
 Pragya understands things about Abhi's mind, Abhi tells her how can this happen, Pragya says that she can listen to his mind because she is his best friend
 pragna ko aankh band karne ko kahkar vah man hi man sochataa he ki use pragna se uske dil kii baat puch leni chahie
 After a while garbage goes in Abhi's eye which Pragya helps her to remove
 iske baad abhi pragna ke chehre kii haldi saaf karata he, is dauraan donon ek duusare ke saath kuch achche pal bitaate hai
 The comments duusari taraf gharavaale charchaa karte hai ki jodi upar se banakar aati he
 They say that what happens is what happens
 mitali kahati he ki haldi to pragna ko lag gai, ab abhi kii shaadi kisase hogi, pragna se yaa tanu se
 Aaliya gets enraged at this and tells them to shut up
 is par daadi use daantati he ki sabakuch uuparavaale kii marji se hota he, use sanbhal janaa chahie varna shaadi main bhi kuch aisa hi hoga
 In tomorrow's episode, we will see that Abhi tells the family that someone got a call that East had an accident and is in the hospital
 pragna or baaki gharavaale purab ko dekhne aspataal jate hai, lekin aalia ko tanu par shaq ho jaataa he ki usne hi purab hamalaa karavaaya he
 Householders on the other hand discuss that the pair comes from above

 unke phans besabri se iskaa intjaar kar rahe the
 But if you are going to watch the film expecting Bajrangi Bhaijaan or Sultan then you will be disappointed
 beshak tubalite se bahut apekshaayen lekar na jaaen
 Know which 5 things can be beaten by Salman's film: What is different from Salman Khan in Tubelight, Learn in 7 points
 ve isi ke mureed hai
 But Salman Khan is seen in an over-emotional style with a belly in his tublight, he does not match his box office image
 yahi vajah he ki jahaan taubalite ke pehle din ke subah ke shoj khaali the vahiin haul main wo sitiyaan or taaliyaan bhi baji, jiske liye unke phans jane jate hai
 Point 2- Why does Sohail Khan see Salman's brother's love for Bhai in the film with Liaoshel Khan but it would be too much to talk about him
 arse baad sohail parde par dikhe hai or lagata he ki screen se unki duuri sahi bhi he
 It is better that a good character artist is replaced
 aisa karne se seens kaa impact kuch or hi hota
 Point3- music is also a fuse in the case of fusetublite film music
 radio ko chhod diya jaae to or koi gaanaa aapako yaad nahin rahegaa
 Whereas in Salman's films, music has been a tremendous crowd puller
 tubalite se shahrukh kii tasviren li, jaadugar ke role main aae najarpoint 4- kabir ne khub khinchi filmakabir khan ke bare main ye baat ham shartiya kahenge ki vah parde par international imoshans dikhaane ke master hai
 But in the course of making a great film, he has drawn the second half of the film so much that you can comfortably come back to the bathroom
 or aapako lagegaa bhi nahin ki aapane kuch miss kiya he
 Film Review: The Emotional Drama is Salman's 'tubelight' Point 5- The emotions do not look good The end of the film is also a bit difficult to digest
 tubalite ko sukhad ant dene ke liye hi ise frem kiya gaya he lekin ise dekhne ke baad aap yahi kahenge- bhai hamen yakeen he ki ye thodaa zyada ho gaya
 
 
 Yes, but there are other light factor factors in the tubelight
 radio song, om puri kii pregence, jishaan ayub kaa abhinay, child actor matin kii kutanes, chini actress juju kii beauty aise factor hai jo salmaan ke staradam ke saath tubalite ko chamakane main madad karte hai
 Bollywood actress Malaika Arora has no answer
 malaika aroda (malaika Arora) kii photo ho yaa video, donon hi soshal media par dhamal machaane ke liye kaaphi hote hai
 Recently, he has once again made a similar blast on social media
 darasal, actress malaika aroda (malaika Arora) ne haal hi main apni ek photo instagram par share kii he

 afjal guru kii sajaa ko lekar kendriya ispaat mantri benny prasad verma ke bayaan par hangaamaa khadaa ho gaya
 In conversation with Aaj Tak, Beni Babu advocated the punishment of life imprisonment at the place of hanging for the culprit of the Parliament attack
 sansad hamale kii 11veen barsi par jaise hi bayaan aayaa, bavaal much gaya
 After a sharp reaction from political parties, the minister withdrew his statement
 benny prasad verma manmohan sarkaar main ispaat mantri hai, lekin ajtak ne jab sansad hamale ke gunahagaar afjal guru kii faansee ko lekar sawaal kiya to aatanki se itani hamadardi hui ki dil kii baat jubaan par aa gai
 The lyrics softened
 mantri mahoday jaj ke kirdaar main aa gaye

 In front of the media, Afzal was punished for Guru on his behalf

 kabhi wo mahangaai ko aam logon ke liye behatar bataa dete hai, to kabhi bayaan dekar apni hi sarkaar ke mantriyon ke liye museebate badhaane main peeche nahin rahete

 It is said that the arrow coming from the bow and the word coming from the tongue does not come back
 lekin asambhav ko sambhav banane kaa khel hi to siyasat he
 The statement created a ruckus, so Beni Babu did not take any time to take a U-turn
 is mausam main thodi si bhi laaparvaahee beemaari ko nyotaa dene ke baraabar he
 As soon as winter starts, most people start to suffer from cold and cold

 " The second World Hindi Conference in Chicago ended on Sunday
 is dauraan kaarykram main shaamil hone pahunche uparashtrapati venkaiyanaidune apane samaapan bhaashan main hindu dharm se lekar bharat kii kshamtaaon tak kaa bakhaan kiya
 He stressed that at present, some people are spreading misinformation about the word Hindu and are trying to make it 'untouchable' and 'unbearable'
 is dauraan naidu ne hindu dharm ke sachche mulyon ke sangrakshan kii jarurat par jor diya taaki aisi dharanaon ko badla ja sake jo 'galat soochnaaon' par aadhaarit hai
 Apart from this, Naidu also said that India believes in universal tolerance and believes all religions to be true
 hindu dharm ke ahm pahaluon ko rekhaankit karte hue unhone kaha ki 'saajha karnaa' or 'khyaal rakhana' hindu darshan ke mul tatv hai
 Naidu regretted that a lot of misinformation (about Hinduism) was being spread
 lihaaja, vyakti ko vichaaron ko sahi pariprekshya main dekhakar prastut karnaa chahie taaki duniya ke saamne sabase pramanik pariprekshya pesh ho paae

 unhone ye bhi kaha ki hindu hajaaron varshon se pratadit ho rahe hai kyonki ve apane mul siddhanton kaa paalan karnaa or aadhyatmikta ko bhul gaye hai
 Bhagwat insisted that we have to come together
 pradhanmantri narendra modi or america ke raashtrapati donald trump kii japan main shuukravaar ko mulaakaat hui
 The world was eyeing this meeting
 haalanki donon netaaon ke bich khushnuma maahaul main mulaakaat hui
 The first was a trilateral dialogue between India, Japan and the US, which included PM Modi, US President Donald Trump and Japan's PM Shinzo Abe
 is dauraan trump ne piem modi or japani piem abe ko chunaav main jeet kii badhai di
 This was followed by bilateral talks between India and the US
 is dauraan donon deshon ke netaaon ne kai ahm muddon par charchaa kii
 At this meeting, President Trump told Prime Minister Modi, 'we have become very good friends
 isse pehle america or bharat main kabhi itani najdiki nahin hui
 i can say this confidently that we will work together in many fields, especially in the military sector
 aaj ham log kaarobaar ke mudde par bhi baat kar rahe hai
 'trump said,' PM Modi you have done a great job of bringing people together
 mujhe yaad he ki jab aap pehali baar chunaav jitkar satta main aae the, tab kai dhade the or ve aapas main ladate the
 Now they are united
 yah aapaki kshamta kaa sabase bada sammaan he
 'challenges persist This meeting of PM Modi and US President Trump has come at a time when there is a conflict between the two countries over their respective interests
 japan main piem modi se mulaakaat se pehle trump ne twit karke bhi saaf kiya tha ki wo bharat ke america saamaanon par tarriff lagane ke faisle ko sweekaar nahin karenge, lekin bharat ke iraade bhi buland hai
 During that time, India had clearly told the US Secretary of State that India would take decisions in its own interest and not at the behest of America
 ab dekhnaa he ki jeet ke baad aatmavishvaas se labarej pradhanmantri narendra modi america ke chakravyuuh ko kaise todate hai?haal hi main america ne bharat ko mili janerlined system of prefrence (jiespi) darje ko khatm karne kii dhamkee di, to bharat ne bhi america saamaanon par zyada tarriff lagane kii taiyaari kar lee
 Now the US has reservations about India's decision to impose higher tariffs
 jiespi kaa darja milane se bharat ko america main apane saamaanon par maamuli tact dena padataa he
 With its removal, Indian goods will be taxed more
 piem modi se mulaakaat se pehle america raashtrapati ne twit kiya, 'main pradhanmantri narendra modi se is maamle par baat karne kaa besabri se intjaar kar rahaa hum ki bharat ne varshon se america ke khilaaf bahut zyada tarriff lagaaya he
 Now recently the tariff has increased further
 yah sweekaar nahin he or bharat ko tarriff ko waapas lenaa hi padegaa
 'the dispute here is between Made in India and Made in America
 iske alaava america yah bhi chahta he ki bharat apane sabase bharosemand dost rus se raksha upkaran na kharide, balki usase (america) kharide
 Failing to do so, the US has also threatened to ban India under the Countering American Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA)
 haalanki bharat america ke dabaav ke aage jhukne ko taiyaar nahin he
 India has tied up with Russia to buy the S-400 missile defense system
 rus hameshaa se bhi bharat kaa bharosemand dost or raksha upkarnon kaa saplir rahaa he
 Not only this, the US also says that India should not buy oil from Iran, but it is difficult for India to do so
 isaki vajah yah he ki bharat sabase zyada tel iran se hi kharidta he
 India wants the US to allow it to buy oil from Iran
 isse pehle ek baar trump prashasan is mudde par jhuk chukaa he or bharat ko iran se tel kharidne kii chhot de chukaa he, lekin ek baar phir se uskaa mizaaj badal rahaa he
 It is challenging to practice America on all these issues in front of PM Modi
 vaise modi sarkaar ko ummid he ki vah america ke saath rishton ko majboot banane or in muddon ko sulajhane main safal hogi
 However, only time will tell how successful PM Modi is in breaking the cycle of American protectionism? Earlier, External Affairs Minister Jaishankar Prasad had said in a meeting with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that India will take care of its interests and America Will work closely with iske atirikt america lagaataar H-1 visa ke niyamon main badlaav kar rahaa he, jisase bhartiya prabhavit ho rahe hai
 In such a situation, India also demands that America take care of India's needs and fulfill them

 After this, i started teaching poor children for free
 yahaan padhai ke liye aanevaale bachche kaaphi garib parivaar se aate hai, jinke mata-pita mazdooree kar apana guzaara karte hai

 Sial first pushes Khan first causing him to fall to the ground
 iske baad jab vah siyaal kii taraf waapas aate hai to siyaal unke saath hathapayee karne lagate hai
 Watching the matter grow, the TV crew separates the two
 haalanki, marpet ke kuch senked ke baad siyaal apni seat par baith jate hai
 And after a few seconds, the victim journalists also return to their seats
 donon aise pesh aate hai jaise abhi kuch minute pehle donon ke bich kuch hua hi nahin he
 Later, the anchor of the show starts the show again

 Singal says that the object is closely related to sex
 daanpaty jivan kii buniyaad hi sex par tiki he or aajkal teji se tuutate rishton kaa mul kaaran bhi pati-patni ke bich sex sambandh kii kami hi he
 According to Naresh Singal, lack of sex or sexual deviance is also directly related to object defect
 single ke anusaar sex or prem sambandhon main taazgi banaae rakhane main vaastu mahatvapurn hota he
 If the northwest (NW) of your house is defective, then your interest in sex decreases
 yahi nahin agar aapke ghar or bedroom kii deevaaron par galat rang he, jis plot main aapkaa makaan bana he uskaa or aapke bedroom kaa sahi aakaar na hona aadi kai kaaran hai jo aapke jivan main kadavaahat paidaa karne or extra merital afares kaa kaaran banate hai
 According to singles, if you keep shoes and shoes under your bed or in its rack, then it is not good for the husband-wife relationship
 iske alaava sukhi vaivaahik jivan ke liye agar aapke paas dabl bed he to usamen ek hi bada vaala metress bichhaaen agar yah sambhav na ho to donon metress ke bich main koi motaa mat bichhaaen or uske baad unke upar chadar bichhaaen
 If this does not happen, there is always a possibility of a quarrel between the husband and wife
 bedroom main teen object na lagaaein, jaise teen phool, teen candal aadi
 According to the singles, the husband and wife should not keep water on their head and the color of their bedroom walls should be light and bright and not cracked

 Apart from this, if your house is not north-east (NE) or is chopped or circular or it is defective, then it can be difficult to get children and it can be defective even if there are children

 "different bones meet at different times, some at the age of 16, some at 18 and some at 20
 ve bataate hai, ‘‘cartillage eks-re main nahin dikhte hai, isliye ham haddiyon kii growth ke pattern ko dekhakar kisi vyakti kii sahi umr kaa nirdhaaran karte hai
 Dogra cites examples that a boy accused of murder was being described as a minor
 vah dikhne main 15 varsh kaa hi lag rahaa tha, lekin uski haddiyon se umr 23 varsh kii hone kaa khulaasa hua
 He said, "some bones take a little time to become fully formed

 But at a time when sexual development is starting early, what will happen to the bones? Endocrinologist of Apollo Hospital, Delhi, Dr
 ambarish mittal ne bataaya, ‘‘jaldi jawan hone kaa jokhim yahi he ki haddiyon kii umr pehle hi bad jaae
 "A girl whose first period is 8 years of age may stop growing compared to others, but her bones can then be like 12 or 13 years old
" mittal ne kaha, ‘‘thyride or growth hormones ke disorder or kharaab poshan se bhi haddiyon kii umr badal jaati he

 But when the well-known faces Anjaan-si meet in a gathering, the memories come back
 yaaden phir dobaaraa laut aati hai
 Sometimes i feel like we have met 100 years ago when i was ten years old
 meraa janm theatre se hua
 Whatever i am today, this stage is due to theater
 maine jab theatre shuru kiya to mere theatre waalon ne mujhe junior artinst kaa role diya tha, ek inspector kaa, jiskaa sirf ek hi dialog tha ki khabardaar numberdaar bhaagane kii koshish kii, police ne chaaron taraf se gher rakhaa he
 This was the dialog
 duusare main jab main second act main gaya to maine ja kaha, numberdaar khabardaar tumne bhaagane kii
 
 
 
 uske baad dialog bhul gaya to wike sharma jo the, hero the, unhone kaha, haa
 
 
 Yes 
 , Inspector Sahab says that do not try to escape, the police have surrounded you from all around
 jo dialog maine bolnaa tha vah dialog unhone puraa kiya kyonki main dialog bhul gaya or uske baad mujhe bahut daant padi, main bahut royaa bhi
 i said, brother Rajesh Khanna, if you want to become an actor, a line is not spoken to you
 shame kii baat he, laanat he tumpe
 i whipped myself a lot and i said that i can never become an actor, but still understand the smile of God, understand the stubbornness, i said, i will do something, i will tell
 main jab filmon main aayaa to meraa koi godfadar nahin tha
 i did not have a relative or a hand in the film industry
 main aayaa thru da united producers film fere tailent contest se
 In the Contest printed Filmfare, Times of India, we took scissors, cut it, filled it and wrote there please send three photographs
 hamane photo bheji
 We were called
 times of india main tha united producers bahut bade-bade producers the, chaahe vah chopra sahib the, bimal roy the, eses dravid the
 
 
 Shakti was feudal, there were many
 unhone kaha ki hamane aapako ek dialog bheja he vah yaad kiya aapane? to main saamne kursi par baitha tha
 And he was such a big producer in a big table, in line, i felt like being court martial
 jaise abhi bandook nikaalenge or mujhe maar daalenge, goli chalaa denge, kyonki saamne akeli ek kursi thi bas
 i said that i have read the same dialogue, but the dialogue that you have, you have not told what its characterization is that the hero explains to his mother that i love a dancing person but me
 
 
 main usko teri ghar kii bahu bananaa chahta hum
 This was the dialogue whose main role was
 maine kaha na kairactor bataae, maa kaa na bataaen hero kaa to bataaen ki vah amir he yaa garib he, maa sakht he, kadak he, naram he, kya he, middle class he, ye aadmi padhaa-likhaa, anpadh he yaa kuch bhi nahin, to chopra sahab ne mujhe jhat se kaha, tum theatre se ho? maine kaha ji
 
 
 i said, you have sent the dialog that in this way the mother has to be converted
 dialog bolie, lekin aapane kairectriseshan nahin bataaya
 Only an actor of this stage can speak
 to bole, acha thik he bhai! tum koi bhi apana ek dialog sunaao
 Now the bite was not sweating blood
 maine kaha, kya dialog boluun
 
 
 And these are big people
 inaki pikchar hamane 10-10 baar dekhi he
 
 
 
 produs, diarect kii hui
 Forgive my friends
 us play kaa dialog kyonki maine vah play kiya hua tha
 So i remembered that dialog and i told him that i can get up from this chair
 to kaha haa, haa jo karnaa he kariye, lekin aap karke bataaen ki kya karenge? to thodaa nervas bhi hua, jis tarah se bolaa, mujhe laga daant ke bol rahe hai
 
 
 Which is the dialog because of which i got into films
 mujhe jepi sippi ne chance diya
 
 
 
 
 40 years ago
 haa, main kalakaar hum, haa
 
 
 Yes, i am an artist, would you listen to my story? Many years ago, i have drunk a cup that is poisoned or nectar for me because of Hoani's seduction
 
 
 ek aisi baat jiskaa ikraar karte hue meri jubaan pe chhaale pad jaaenge, lekin phir bhi kahata hum ki jab main chota tha ek khaufnak vaakya pesh aayaa, kyonki main ek bhayanak aag main funs gaya, jab jinda bachaa to maaloom hua ki main badsoorat ho gaya hum
 Like Suhani has turned into a scary night
 
 
 
 i started to panic when i went out and started sitting in the house to make a song as terrible as it was
 
 
 meraa cheharaa
 
 
 My songs were so sweet
 duniya ne mujhe dutkaara, lekin mere geeton se pyaar karne lage or main chillaata rahaa ki tumne chandani raaton se mohabbat or main ankhon se barsaata hum sitare
 My songs robbed me of thousands
 
 
 hoti gai par main, main kisi se na miltaa
 One day a letter came, i found peace in your songs, if you meet, what will i do? mujhe laga yah khubasurat hasina, bulaao isse yah bulaao isse yah badsoorat cheharaa dikhaa kar puri takat se intkaam luun, maine use bulaayaa vah aae kitni khubasurat hai, shabnam se bhi mulaayam or main jaise, maasoom ke saamne maayusi
 
 
 i kept talking about hiding my face, my songs were auspicious and on my tongue
 
 
 
 i proposed marriage and she was happy
 vah boli haa
 
 
 fine by me
 main khud saham gaya maine chilla ke poocha, koun ho 
 
 
 Where have you come from? 
 
 ? use dhire-se aansu bahaate hue kah diya ki main
 
 
 i am blind maine uski ankhon main dekha, uski ankhon main ishk tha, tab maine kaha, jo tir nigaah kaa bismil nahin vah kehane ko dil to he magar dil nahin
 
 
 The comments filmon main aa to gaya lekin aane ke baad vah khubasurat kamyaabi ki seedhi chadhane kaa mauka, yah sehara to aapke sir he
 
 ki aap hai jinhone mujhe actor se star banaaya
 Made a super star from a star
 kin alphaajon main aapkaa shukriya adaa karun, mujhe samaj main nahin aata
 Love you keep sending me 
 
 
 The love i continued to receive, but i was never able to return that love, but whatever i would like to say, i would also like to thank you
 
 
 vah meri dil kii sachai hogi
 i will have honesty, i will have conscience
 aaj meraa dil halkaa hua aapse guftgu karke, baat karke, or aapkaa maine shukriya adaa kiya
 i feel good that i met you on the pretext
 kise apana kahen is kaabil koi nahin miltaa, kise apana kahe koi is kaabil nahin miltaa, yahaan pathar to bahut milte hai lekin dil nahin miltaa
 So friends, i am also a part of you and like i said earlier, you took out your precious time and say you were in love
 aap yahaan maujuud hue or itani baari sankhya main to main yaheen kahuunga ki bahut-bahut shukriya, thankyuu or meraa bahut-bahut salaam! Whatever i am today, this stage is due to theater
 maine jab theatre shuru kiya to mere theatre waalon ne mujhe junior artinst kaa role diya tha, ek inspector kaa, jiskaa sirf ek hi dialog tha ki khabardaar numberdaar bhaagane kii koshish kii, police ne chaaron taraf se gher rakhaa he
 This was the dialog
 duusare main jab main second act main gaya to maine ja kaha, numberdaar khabardaar tumne bhaagane kii
 
 
 
 uske baad dialog bhul gaya to wike sharma jo the, hero the, unhone kaha, haa
 
 
 Yes 
 , Inspector Sahab says that do not try to escape, the police have surrounded you from all around
 jo dialog maine bolnaa tha vah dialog unhone puraa kiya kyonki main dialog bhul gaya or uske baad mujhe bahut daant padi, main bahut royaa bhi
 i said, brother Rajesh Khanna, if you want to become an actor, a line is not spoken to you
 shame kii baat he, laanat he tumpe
 i whipped myself a lot and i said that i can never become an actor, but still understand the smile of God, understand the stubbornness, i said, i will do something, i will tell
 main jab filmon main aayaa to meraa koi godfadar nahin tha
 i did not have a relative or a hand in the film industry
 main aayaa thru da united producers film fere tailent contest se
 In the Contest printed Filmfare, Times of India, we took scissors, cut it, filled it and wrote there please send three photographs
 hamane photo bheji
 We were called
 times of india main tha united producers bahut bade-bade producers the, chaahe vah chopra sahib the, bimal roy the, eses dravid the
 
 
 Shakti was feudal, there were many
 unhone kaha ki hamane aapako ek dialog bheja he vah yaad kiya aapane? to main saamne kursi par baitha tha
 And he was such a big producer in a big table, in line, i felt like being court martial
 jaise abhi bandook nikaalenge or mujhe maar daalenge, goli chalaa denge, kyonki saamne akeli ek kursi thi bas
 i said that i have read the same dialogue, but the dialogue that you have, you have not told what its characterization is that the hero explains to his mother that i love a dancing person but me
 
 
 main usko teri ghar kii bahu bananaa chahta hum
 This was the dialogue whose main role was
 maine kaha na kairactor bataae, maa kaa na bataaen hero kaa to bataaen ki vah amir he yaa garib he, maa sakht he, kadak he, naram he, kya he, middle class he, ye aadmi padhaa-likhaa, anpadh he yaa kuch bhi nahin, to chopra sahab ne mujhe jhat se kaha, tum theatre se ho? maine kaha ji
 
 
 i said, you have sent the dialog that in this way the mother has to be converted
 dialog bolie, lekin aapane kairectriseshan nahin bataaya
 Only an actor of this stage can speak
 to bole, acha thik he bhai! tum koi bhi apana ek dialog sunaao
 Now the bite was not sweating blood
 maine kaha, kya dialog boluun
 
 
 And these are big people
 inaki pikchar hamane 10-10 baar dekhi he
 
 
 
 produs, diarect kii hui
 Forgive my friends
 us play kaa dialog kyonki maine vah play kiya hua tha
 So i remembered that dialog and i told him that i can get up from this chair
 to kaha haa, haa jo karnaa he kariye, lekin aap karke bataaen ki kya karenge? to thodaa nervas bhi hua, jis tarah se bolaa, mujhe laga daant ke bol rahe hai
 
 
 Which is the dialog because of which i got into films
 mujhe jepi sippi ne chance diya
 
 
 
 
 40 years ago
 haa, main kalakaar hum, haa
 
 
 Yes, i am an artist, would you listen to my story? Many years ago, i have drunk a cup that is poisoned or nectar for me because of Hoani's seduction
 
 
 ek aisi baat jiskaa ikraar karte hue meri jubaan pe chhaale pad jaaenge, lekin phir bhi kahata hum ki jab main chota tha ek khaufnak vaakya pesh aayaa, kyonki main ek bhayanak aag main funs gaya, jab jinda bachaa to maaloom hua ki main badsoorat ho gaya hum
 Like Suhani has turned into a scary night
 
 
 
 i started to panic when i went out and started sitting in the house to make a song as terrible as it was
 
 
 meraa cheharaa
 
 
 My songs were so sweet
 duniya ne mujhe dutkaara, lekin mere geeton se pyaar karne lage or main chillaata rahaa ki tumne chandani raaton se mohabbat or main ankhon se barsaata hum sitare
 My songs robbed me of thousands
 
 
 hoti gai par main, main kisi se na miltaa
 One day a letter came, i found peace in your songs, if you meet, what will i do? mujhe laga yah khubasurat hasina, bulaao isse yah bulaao isse yah badsoorat cheharaa dikhaa kar puri takat se intkaam luun, maine use bulaayaa vah aae kitni khubasurat hai, shabnam se bhi mulaayam or main jaise, maasoom ke saamne maayusi
 
 
 i kept talking about hiding my face, my songs were auspicious and on my tongue
 
 
 
 i proposed marriage and she was happy
 vah boli haa
 
 
 fine by me
 main khud saham gaya maine chilla ke poocha, koun ho 
 
 
 Where have you come from? 
 
 ? use dhire-se aansu bahaate hue kah diya ki main
 
 
 i am blind maine uski ankhon main dekha, uski ankhon main ishk tha, tab maine kaha, jo tir nigaah kaa bismil nahin vah kehane ko dil to he magar dil nahin
 
 
 The comments filmon main aa to gaya lekin aane ke baad vah khubasurat kamyaabi ki seedhi chadhane kaa mauka, yah sehara to aapke sir he
 
 ki aap hai jinhone mujhe actor se star banaaya
 Made a super star from a star
 kin alphaajon main aapkaa shukriya adaa karun, mujhe samaj main nahin aata
 Love you keep sending me 
 
 
 The love i continued to receive, but i was never able to return that love, but whatever i would like to say, i would also like to thank you
 
 
 vah meri dil kii sachai hogi
 i will have honesty, i will have conscience
 aaj meraa dil halkaa hua aapse guftgu karke, baat karke, or aapkaa maine shukriya adaa kiya
 i feel good that i met you on the pretext
 kise apana kahen is kaabil koi nahin miltaa, kise apana kahe koi is kaabil nahin miltaa, yahaan pathar to bahut milte hai lekin dil nahin miltaa
 So friends, i am also a part of you and like i said earlier, you took out your precious time and say you were in love
 aap yahaan maujuud hue or itani baari sankhya main to main yaheen kahuunga ki bahut-bahut shukriya, thankyuu or meraa bahut-bahut salaam! He completed the dialogue that i had to speak because i forgot the dialog and after that i got scolded, i cried a lot
 maine kaha, bhai rajesh khanna tum actor bananaa chaahate ho ek line to tumse boli nahin jaati
 Shame on you maine bahut kosa apane aap ko or maine kaha ki main kabhi actor nahin ban saktaa, lekin phir bhi bhagwaan kii muskaan samaj lijie, jid samaj lijie, maine kaha, kuch na kuch to karuunga, karke bataaungaa
 When i came to the movies, i had no godfather
 meraa film industry main koi rishtedaar yaa koi sir par haath rakhane vaala nahin tha
 i came through the United Producers film from Fair Talent Contest
 contest chapa filmphere main, times of india main, hamane kanchi lekar use kaata, use bharaa or vahaan likhaa tha plis send thri photographs
 We sent a photo
 hamako bulaayaa gaya
 United Producers were very big producers in the Times of India, whether it was Chopra Sahib, Bimal Roy, SS Dravid
 
 
 shakti samant the, bahut saare the
 They said that we have sent you a dialog, did you remember that? So i was sitting in the chair in front
 or vah ek badi-si teble main line main, itane bade-bade producers the, mujhe aise lag rahaa tha jaise court marshall ho rahaa he
 Like, just take out the gun and kill me, i will shoot, because there was only one chair in front
 maine kaha ki vahi dialog to maine padhaa he lekin yah jo dialog he aapane yah nahin bataaya he ki iskaa kairectriseshan kya he ki hero apni maa ko samajhaata he ki main ek naachne vaali se pyaar karata hum lekin mujhe
