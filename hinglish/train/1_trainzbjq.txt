 What would happen if the average Indian was 30 percent richer than an average Chinese citizen? First, India's per capita income would have been $ 8,500 instead of the current $ 1,500 a year
 isse bharat 80 kharab dollar ke aasapaas duniya kii duusari sabase badi arthvyavastha hota
 What would have happened if the poor had not been able to overcome the current situation, such as the Food Security Bill and MGNREGA, and if it had the largest express-way network in the world, plenty of cheap electricity and good ports? These are not the minds of any economist
 yah hamen yaad dilaataa he ki adhiktar bhartiya ek aise tathy se yaa to anbhigya hai yaa use bhul chuke hai jo kalpana nahin balki vaastavik he
 Less than 10 years before India's economic reforms began in 1991, India's per capita income by 1982 was 30 percent higher than that of China
 vishwa bank ke aankadon ke anusaar, ausat bharatiyon kii vaarshik aay 1982 main 279 dollar thi, jabaki ek ausat chini naagarik saal main sirf 201 dollar kamata tha jo bhartiya kii tulana main 28 pratishat kam thi
 Today, China's per capita income is 309 percent higher than India
 viksit hone se inkaar karte desh main jeene kii jo ham keemat chukaa rahe hai, uski misaal sirf amiri kam hone se nahin milti
 At the time of independence, India and South Korea had the same level of per capita income

 Their income has not increased like this
 iske liye vahaan kii sarkaar ne udyogon ko badhaava dene liye nitiyaan banaain

 tabhi to hamaare vitt mantri bhi hairaan hai ki bharat ke kaarobaari videsh main nivesh karnaa kyon pasand kar rahe hai
 One of the major challenges before them is how to put India as an attractive investment destination for foreign investors
 bhartiya udyogpati duniyabar main companiyaan kharid rahe hai
 For this, they are investing abroad in a big way, but are shying away from investing in India
 jaahir he hamaari nitiyaan doshapurn hai
 Over the years, the price of underperformance has become so big that we have started mistaking the symptoms as the reason
 kam prati vyakti aay, kharaab sadaken or khatm na hone vaali garibi sab bharat ke vikaas se bhaybheet desh hone kii dein hai
 The reason for this is that the country has been refusing to bridge the ever-widening and widening gap between performance and possibility
 iske lakshan dashakon se saamne aate rahe hai
 Things like the sluggish growth rate in the 1970s, when (in real sense GDP growth was just 3 per cent per annum), Narasimha Rao's mid-way policy towards reforms in the 1990s and the NDA and UPA governments' coalition of false pretexts of religion, all All are just tricks to make the country sluggish
 bharat ko viksit desh koun bana saktaa he? iskaa jawaab he netaa or yah jawaab bahut utsahjanak nahin he
 But the task is not as hard as it seems
 ve sirf apane vaadon or naaron ke shabd badalakar shuruyaat kar sakate hai
 How would it be if we promised to double the income instead of promising to reduce poverty? Japan is the world's first miracle economy
 usne china se bahut pehle bharat ko maat de di thi
 He pledged to increase income and reduce poverty through him
 1961 main japan ke pradhanmantri hayato ikeda ne vaada kiya ki dashak khatm hone tak japan kii paariwarik aay doguni kar denge
 Ikeda's Japan achieved this goal in just seven years
 bharat main netaaon kaa garib hitkaari rukh akasar madhyam varg virdohi ho jaataa he
 The result is a distribution of poverty rather than wealth

 aam aadmi party sarkaar ne pichley dedh saal main jitne bhi faisle liye wo ab sawaalon ke ghere main hai
 After the High Court's decision, Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung started a committee to examine 400 files of the functioning of the Delhi government
 philhal cameti ke gathan or jaanch ke tareeke par aam aadmi party ne aapatti jataate hue alji se 5 sawaal puche hai
 Aam Aadmi Party leader Ashutoshne fiercely targeted LG Najeeb Jung during a press conference on Saturday
 ashutosh ne kaha ki chuni hui sarkaar ne cabinet meeting ke jariye bataaya ki alji kii shungalu cameti asanvaidhanik he or jis tarah se alji adhikariyon ko dhamkee de rahe hai or bahari logon ko sarkari file dikhaa rahe hai, wo galat he
 Recently, an elected government has been threatened in the case of 400 files from the LG office
 alji najeeb jang kii viceroy se tulana karne karte hue ashutosh ne kaha ki adhikaron kaa maamal supreme court main he to iskaa faisla vahiin hoga
 But the kind of language being used by LG is wrong
 alji bijepi ke pravaktaaki tarah baat kar rahe hai
 The elected government of Delhi is being threatened by the CBI, but Aam Aadmi Party are agitators, they are not afraid of the police and the CBI
 kejariwal sarkaar kii 400 file kii jaanch kar rahi shungalu cameti ko lekar aam aadmi party ne uparajyapal najeeb jang se 5 sawaal puche hai-1
 Tell LG what provisions of the constitution and under which section of the law gave the committee the authority to examine 400 files? 2
 alji kii itani haisiyat nahin lekin wo modi ke kehane par damanchakra chalaa rahe hai
 LG tell who constituted the committee at the behest of which leader? 3
 sarkari file ko har aadmi nahin dekh saktaa he
 Why are LG doing illegal work? 4
 shungalu cameti kii taraf se adhikariyon ko phone karke bulaayaa jaataa he
 Under what authority and law is the committee calling the officers? 5
 adhikariyon ko dhamkee bhare phone ja rahe hai ki file mantriyon ko na dikhaaen
 LG Sahab replies? The Aam Aadmi Party has accused LG Najeeb Jung of being involved in the scam
 ashutosh ne aarope lagaate hue kaha ki jab alji petroleum mantralay main joint secetry the, tab panna mukta ghotaale kaa maamla sibiai tak pahunchaa or alji ko istipha dena pad gaya tha
 Apart from this, lg's role is also in not conducting investigation in the CNG fitness scheme
 khud ghotaale main fanse alji aam aadmi party ko dhamkee na den
 Give CBI money to those who fear the Modi government
 raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari ne kaha he ki piemail-en pramukh navaj sharif ne mulaakaat kii unki apil ko thukraa diya he, haalanki unhone sainya shaasha parvej musharraf ke shashan ke dauraan purv pradhanmantri ko faansee se bachaane main mahatvapurn bhoomika adaa kii thi
 Zardari, who was camping in Lahore at this time to take stock of the Pakistan People's Party's preparations for the upcoming general election, wanted to meet Sharif to mourn the death of his brother Abbas Sharif
 lahore main apane nijee nivas bilaval house main aagantukon se baatcheet main jaradaari ne shikaayat kii ki sharif ne unase milane se manaa kar diya jabaki ek samay unhone unki jaan bachaai thi
 Zardari has claimed that he saved Sharif from being hanged by former President Musharraf
 unhone kaha ki 1999 main sainya takhtapalat ke jariye piemail-en sarkaar ko hataae jane ke baad musharraf ne jab sharif ko jail main daal diya tha to sharif ke saath unki ‘dosti’ ho gayi thi
 Zardari claimed, at that time, Musharraf was pressurizing Judge Rahmat Hussain Jafri to punish Sharif severely
 jaradaari ke hawaale se ek akhbaar ne likhaa he ki meri nyaayadhish jaafaree se thodi jaan pahchaan thi or jab maine suna ki musharraf, navaj ko sajaa die jane par dabaav daal rahe hai to maine unako salaah di ki maamle ko gun dosha ke aadhaar par sulajhaayen
 He said that he succeeded in persuading Jafri not to give harsh punishment to Sharif

 On the one hand the common man is getting double due to inflation, on the other hand, to increase the salary allowances of Members of Parliament, the Central Government is going to bring an important bill in the monsoon session of Parliament starting on Monday
 yah vidheyak sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ke agenda main shaamil he
 Controversial Civil Nuclear Accountability Bill and Judicial Standards and Accountability Bill are prominent in important legislative work in the Monsoon Session but there is still confusion about the Women's Reservation Bill which has been approved by the Rajya Sabha long back
 sampradayik hinsa nishedh vidheyak bhi sarkaar kii kaarysoochee main pramukh sthaan rakhata he
 Sonia Gandhi-led National Advisory Council has discussed this bill
 yahi haalat sthaneey ikaayiyon main mahilaon ke 33 fisadi aarakshan ko badhaakar 50 fisadi karne vaale vidheyak kii bhi he
 Meanwhile, a draft bill is being prepared to increase the salary allowances of mps after being recommended by the Joint Parliamentary Committee
 samiti ne saansadon ke vetan ko 16 hajaar rupee prati maah se badhaakar 80,001 karne kii sifarish kii thi
 This salary is one rupee more than the salary of the Secretary to the Central Government
 loksabhaa ke 545 or rajyasabha ke 250 saansadon ke vetan bhatton main antim baar vruddhi kareeb das saal pehle kii gayi thi
 The Sixth Pay Commission for Government employees came into effect from January 2006
 congress ke charan das mahant kii adhyakshata vaali samiti ne sansad satr ke chaalu rahane ke dauraan saansadon ke dainik bhatte ko ek hajaar rupaye se badhaakar do hajaar rupee prati maah karne kii bhi sifarish kii he
 The committee has also suggested increasing the constituency allowances and office allowances
 sansadeey kaary mantri pawan kumaar bansal ne maheene bhar chalane vaale monsoon satr main sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ke bare main faisla karne ke liye vibhinn mantralayon tathaa vibhaagon ke sachivon ke saath ek baithak kii
 The anti-hijacking (amendment) Bill 2010 and the Chemical Weapons Agreement (amendment) Bill are also likely to be included in the list of top priority Bills in the Monsoon Session
 vimaan apharan rodhi vidheyak main apartaaon ko kadi sajaa die jane kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 Around 110 Bills are currently awaiting passage in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha and the Women's Reservation Bill has not found a place in this priority list
 is samay ek sansadeey samiti asainya parmaanu javabdehi vidheyak kii padtaal kar rahi he
 At the same time the bill was introduced on the last day of the budget session, there was strong resistance from the Left parties and the BJP
 nyaayik maapdand or javabdehi vidheyak kaa makasad nyaayik maapdandon ko tay karnaa tathaa ucchtam nyaayalay yaa ucch nyaayalay ke kisi nyaayadhish ke ‘rduvyavahaar yaa aakshamata’ kii shikaayat se nipatane ke liye kisi tantra kii sthapana karnaa he
 It also provides for disclosure of assets and liabilities of judges
 vidhi mantri em virappa moili ne haal hi main kaha tha ki vah nyaaypalika ko uski bhul chook tathaa ‘bhrashtachar par shankaaon ko saaf’ karne ke liye ‘javabdeh’ banaaenge
 The nation will once again remember its martyrs on Gandhi Sacrifice Day, 30 January
 is din hone vaale dher saare kaaryakramon kaa centre banataa he rajghat
 Here the President offers a special flower garland at Gandhi Samadhi at exactly ten to 58 minutes
 phir sena ke teenon angon kii teen tukadiyaan apane hathiyaaron ko ulataa karti hai
 The trumpeter of the army playing a tune called 'lost Post' on his bugle indicates a two-minute silence across the country
 sena kii top is maun kii soochna gola dagkar detii he
 And maybe not everywhere, but everything stops at Gandhi Samadhi
 bas thamati nahin he gulaami kii zanjeeron kii tej khankhanaahat
 We do not want to remove these chains even after so many years of independence
 gulaami kii ye zanjeeren bahut hi bhavy jo hai! hamaare is shahid diwas kii rasm kaa har ang, ek-ek hissaa britani sainik pratikon se bharaa padaa he
 These symbols do not match the dreams of those who were martyred in the freedom struggle
 ve log jinke viruddh lade the, unki, angrejon kii sainya parampara kii bhavyata kaa hi bakhaan karte hai ye pratik
 This abominable work would have been done anywhere else, but it would have happened at Gandhi Samadhi
 uski samadhi par jiskaa hathiyaaron, banduukon, sena or britani reeti-rivaaj, taur-tareekon se koi bhi sambandh nahin tha
 This samadhi, which has become a symbol of non-violence across the world, is entered at Rajghat by three troops made from three parts of our army
 saare shraddhalu is jagah juute utaar kar aate hai, par is din teenon tukadiyon ke sainik apane chamakaae gaye shandaar juuton ke saath yahaan pravesh karte hai
 All subsequent ceremonies are decorated with specific traditions of the British Army, which according to them would have been right
 lekin bich main achaanak gandhiji kaa priy bhajan 'raghupati raghav raja ram' bhi sunai de jaae to chaunk mat padie
 It was not an original part of this grandly considered program
 bahut baad main or shaayad bahut beman se ise us kaarykram kaa hissaa banaaya gaya tha
 Gandhiji's beloved hymns begin to be sung
 raashtrapati mahoday ke aane kii soochna milti he
 When he enters, at the samadhi, the tone of singing bhajans begins to slow down
 bhajan puraa hona bhi jaruri nahin he
 It is a beautiful way of spending time till the arrival of the President
 ab raashtrapati pushpanjali arpit karte hai
 These tributes are not offered in a native or frantic manner
 europe main, england main jise 'rith' kaha jaataa he, use yahaan apanaaya gaya he shuru se hi
 a garland of flowers adorned in a large round shape
 praaia: yah tiron par taaje phulon ko sajaakar banaai jaati he
 Clarion then rings
 'lost post' kii dhun
 The British army has been remembering their martyrs with this mourning tune
 iske baad prarambh hota he do minute kaa maun
 This silent tribute is also not part of our tradition
 or na gyaarah baje kaa samay bhi
 It is said that the ceasefire treaty was signed at exactly eleven in 1918 after the First World War
 shahid diwas ke aayojan main isi samay ko chun liya gaya he
 The ceremony, which began in 1953, shouting the chains of their slavery in a two-minute silence to commemorate the martyrs
 isse pehle gandhi samadhi par 30 janvari ko chaar baar yah shahid diwas bahut hi saadagi se, par bahut hi shraddha se manaaya gaya tha
 In those days samadhi was also very simple
 na to aaj kii tarah us par kaala sangemarmar madha gaya tha or na choubees ghante gas barbaad karne vaali 'amar jyoti' vahaan jala karti thi
 In 1951, the Parliament passed the 'rajghat Samadhi Act'
 samadhi kii dekhbhaal, rakh-rakhaav ke liye tab ke awaas mantralay (ab shahari vikaas) ke antargat ek samiti kaa gathan kiya gaya tha
 It was only after this that the grand ceremony which has been repeated till date
 is samiti ke adhyaksh praaia: koi varisht gandhivadi rakhe jate hai par baaki kaam apane dhang se hota rahata he
 In 1970, for the first time, thirty members of Parliament, under the leadership of Acharya Kripalani, Madhu Limaye and Samar Guha, opposed the rituals filled in the Martyr's Day celebrations and publicly condemned it by making statements
 rajghat samiti ke kuch sadasyon ne bhi isamen unka saath diya tha
 It was not that the Government had not taken seriously the matter of such large and such large number of Members of Parliament
 par tab 30 janvari aane hi vaali thi
 The government stated its compulsion
 kaha ki itnaa kam vakt bachaa he, isamen to koi buniyadi badlaav nahin laayaa ja sakegaa
 Members of Parliament were also generous-hearted
 dhiraj vaale the
 In this way, the celebration of 1971 was celebrated as it was
 uske baad agle saal bhi yah kaam ho nahin paaya
 Then the government had no shortage of time, there must have been a lack of will
 isliye 1972 ke samaaroh main bhi samaaroh kaa mul rup, britani parampara jyon kii tyon rahi
 Just some of Gandhiji's favorite hymns were definitely added
 vah bhi aisi jagah, jisase mul kaarykram par bhajanon kii upasthiti pataa na chal paae
 The defense minister was then asked about why all this could not change? His reply was: 'the government has taken the opinion of all the opposing parties
 ' yani kam se kam britani nakal ke maamle main hamaare sattarudh dal or virdohi dalon main duuri ghat chali thi
 From 1973 to 1976, the ruling parties and the opposing parties must have been busy with more important work
 tab aa gaya 1977
 Only the opposition party came to power
 kuch ko laga tha ki ab to yah samaaroh badal hi jayega, par aisa nahin hua
 When will it happen now? superstar shahrukh khan ne kaha ki vah nakaaratmakataa kii vajah se soshal media se duuri banaae rakhte hai
 Shah Rukh in a live video on social media urged the fans not to swear at social media

 Shahrukh said, 'I don't like to come on Twitter, i don't like abusive people
 mujhe nahin lagata he ki mujhe telephone kholkar nakaaratmakataa dekhne kii jarurat he, isliye mujhe yah pasand nahin he
 There are many stupid and stupid things, so i don't need to read it and i don't like to read it
 'shahrukh ne sabhi se aagrah kiya ki vah soshalmedia par is tarah kii baton se parhez karen or tathy kii ore jaaen, kyonki isamen koi majaa nahin he agar aap kisi ko bura kahana chaahate hai to va aap uske saamne kahen

 The terrorist organization Islamic State (ISIS) has completely destroyed Mosul
 india today ne in bharatiyon kii talash main iraq ke mosul pahunchaa, jahaan inkaa koi atapata nahin chalaa
 Now the question is arising that where did these Indians go? Earlier, the Indian government claimed that these Indians were alive

 However, no such jail has been found in India Today investigation where these Indians are closed

 The central government has been badly clouded after the India Today Ground Zero Report

 At present, there has been no response from the government in this regard

 unki patrika ke mukhaprishth par bhagwaan ganesh bade shandaar tareeke se virajman hai; aavaran ke peeche vaale panne par 'guruji' palathi markar baithe hai, unke sir ke aabhamandal kii kirane teji se fail rahi hai
 There are three garlands of Rudraksha lying around his neck
 unki khuli hui dahini hatheli par om he, or unki ankhon main fauladi tej he
 The title of the magazine itself states: 'identify yourself through palmistry

 yah he shoharat
 It is easy to underestimate the attraction of a guru
 har dharm main, har yug main dhoort log rahe hai, jinhone pehle vishwasaneeyata or aakhirkaar lokapriyata hasil karne ke liye dharm ko apane raste ke taur par istemaal kiya he
 Whether you wear ocher clothes or keep a beard, the distance between such popularity and wealth is very less
 vidambnaa hi he ki jodtod ke saadhan ke rup main kisi dharm ke istemaal kiye jane kii sambhaavna uske centre main nihit hoti haih use daleel ke tat se baandha nahin ja saktaa
 Inattentive, sly people have regularly hunted down institutions of religion, be it temple, mosque, gurudwara or church
 ve alokik pratifal ke vaade se logon ko sammohit karne main maahir hote hai
 The resilience of a wide range of beliefs, and its distance from the laws of traditional behavior, lays the ground for characters whose main purpose is to cheat rather than serve
 hamaare chaaron ore pravachan karne waalon kii takat jaahir he; unke upadeshon se ummid bandhati he, jo manushya kii sabase saamaanya beemaari asahaayta, yaa uski kareebi rishtedaar, noummidi ke joardaar thapedo ke viruddh anubhavrodhak suraksha kavach taiyaar karti he
 But can any religious thug get an audience in jail? Jail is in theory a hell of a dante (the devine comedy): all of you who enter it, give up hope
 jail antim avasthaa hoti he
 You know you're in, and a calendar only shows when you'll get out
 jail kii deevaaron ke bheetar koi chamatkaar nahin hote
 Ironically, most of Tihar's inmates have given up hope long before their dreaded doors were crossed

 More than 40 percent of the prisoners are completely illiterate

 He never used a common toilet
 ye aise laavaaris bachche hai, jinhen unke parivaar or desh ne bahut pehle tyaag diya; dilli ke bachche jinhen hamane car chalaate samay nazarandaaj karne kaa tarika sikh liya, vikaas kii kabhi na mitane vaali bhukh ke liye rashtriya sansaadhan thunsane vaale bhukkhad mahanagar ke malbe hai
 These are not poor born criminals
 jindagi ne unamem se zyaadaatar ko zyada vikalp nahin diya he
 It is ironic that poor, convicted prisoners of Tihar find prison more civilized than independence
 vahaan do vakt kii roti milani tay he or kaam milane kii bhi sambhaavna he
 The director general of Tihar's imprisonment, soft-spoken Neeraj Kumar, has undertaken an important program of reform in Tihar that seeks to reduce crime by making the criminal soft
 tihaad main behtareen linen kameez (yah likhte samay maine vahiin bani kameez pahan rakhi he) banaai jaati he or kai tarah ke utpaada taiyaar kiye jate hai, jinaki gunvattta peshewar kansaltent niyantrit karte hai
 But Tihar is as far away from other jails of the country as Delhi is superior to the rest of India

 However, Siddharth Shukla has been targeted by Mahira Sharma so far, and she often gets involved with him during the task
 haalanki salmaan khan bhi kai baar samajha chuke hai ki jab ladakon kii ladaai ho rahi ho to unhen bich main nahin padana chahie

 pyaaj to bas ek udhaaharan maatr he, ek-ek kar sabhi jaruri vastuon kii keemten aasmaan chhu rahi he
 Now, against the income tax raids, onion traders of Nashik have also announced a two-day strike
 yani, janata kii musiibat badhegi or sarkaar par vipaksh kaa hamalaa tej hoga
 Now the question arises how the prices have become uncontrollable
 aam janata aakhir kisase puche ki uskaa kya kasoor he jo use itani mahangaai jhelni pad rahi he
 Some people sitting in the government are even saying that there is a limit for the government to reduce inflation, after that the government cannot do anything
 duusari ore centre sarkaar badhati mahangaai kaa thikra rajya sarkaron par bhi phodtii rahati he jabaki rajya iske liye puri tarah centre ko jimmedaar bataate hai
 If anyone is crushing in this politics of leaders, then it is the common man
 mahangaai badhane kaa kaaran chaahe jo bhi ho, lekin sarkarein apni jimmedaari se batch nahin sakati
 On the burning issue like rising inflation, you can also know the answers to your hidden questions

 According to the people of the centuries-old tradition of the Rajnath sect, this tradition has been going on for five centuries
 unka kahana he ki 500 se zyada saal pehle baba jasnath ne siddh sampradaay banaaya or khud angaaron par nrity kiya
 Since then, his followers have been following this tradition every year
 suraj dhalate hi naach shuruye haroonges naach shaam dhalane or chand nikalne ke baad shuru hota he
 The people of the first sect burn wood
 jab tak ye lakdia dhadhakate angaaron main tabdeel hoti hai tab tak dhol nagaadon kii thap par siddh sampradaay ke log apane baba jasnath ko yaad karte hai
 Then the archana is worshiped by the fire god and after taking blessings from the Guru, the dance begins on the coals
 raat dhalane ke saath hi sangeet or mantron kaa uccharan bhi tej hota jaataa he
 Anyone who sees the dance of embers dancing to shoals off their feet cannot live without pressing their fingers under their teeth
 jasnath sampradaay ke logon kaa daawa he kii unhen guru ke aashirwad kii vajah se angaaron par chalane yaa nrity karne se koi jalan mahasoos nahi hoti
 How much truth lies in these claims can only be known from the test of science
 lekin ye aasthaa hi he jo jasnath sampradaay ke logon ko sab bhulaakar angaaron par nrity karne kii shakti detii he

 isamen vah ishan khatter ke apojit najar ai thim
 The film was directed by Shashank Khaitan
 yah box offis par safal sabit hui thi
 Shashank Khaitan has directed hit films like Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania and Badrinath Ki Dulhania

 They have begun to take advantage of the split in opposition unity and hit the ground again because the results of the by-elections in UP after their formation came to a bitter experience, where the foundation of opposition unity was laid
 rajya ke 12 vidhayakon ke loksabhaa main chunakar chale jane se rikt hui siton par upachunaav se pehle keel kaanton ko yogi durust karnaa chaahate hai
 He started it from Saharanpur on Saturday and camped at Mandal headquarters here for about 20 hours
 unhone ravivaar kaa din muradabad ke naam kiya
 He spoke to the officials on development and law and order, but held special discussions with the bjp's responsibilities on the preparations for the by-elections in Gangoh and Rampur
 siem yogi ke liye donon hi siten khaasi ahm hai
 Gangoh seat is in Saharanpur district, but falls in the Kairana Lok Sabha seat of Shamli district and bjp's Pradeep Chaudhary has left it after being elected as an MP from Kairana
 saansad babu hukum singh ke nidhan ke baad ek saal pehle hi kairana main upachunaav hua tha
 On the symbol of Rashtriya Lok Dal from the undisclosed alliance of SP, BSP, RLD and Congress, Tabassum Hasan, wife of late Munawwar Hassan, defeated Mriganka Singh of BJP, daughter of Hukum Singh
 lekin is baar sapa-basapa or ralod ke ghoshit gathbandhan se sapa ke simbel par ladakar vah bhaajapa se haar gai
 In fact, two out of five of the Kairana Lok Sabha seats, Nakur and Gangoh assembly seats fall in Saharanpur district and Congress is the second party on these
 2017 main nakud se congress ke imran masood or gangoh se inke judwa bhai noman masood duusare number par rahe the
 These two seats in the by-elections were the reason for bjp's defeat in Kairana
 isiilie haal hi main sampann loksabhaa chunaav main siem yogi ne ishaaron main imran masood ko ‘ajahar masood kaa damaad’ kahkar dhruvikaran kaa daanv chalaa tha
 The Rampur assembly seat is vacated by resignation after being elected MP of Fire Brand leader Azam Khan of SP, which comes under Moradabad division
 johar uniwarsity ko lekar ajam khan lagaataar yogi sarkaar ke nishane par chal rahe hai
 It is clear that the Chief Minister has selected those mandals for terrestrial review first, where the by-elections are to be held in the assembly seats
 inamen gangoh (saharanpur), iglas (aligarh), rampur, pratapgarh, govindnagar (kanpur), toundla (firozabad), kaint (lakhanu), jaidpur (barabanki), manikpur (chitrakoot), balha (baharich), jalalpur (ambedkarnagar) or hamirpur hai
 sps from Rampur and BSP mlas from Jalalpur have been elected as mps, while the rest of the BJP mlas have been elected
 bhaajapa ke liye upachunaav kaa anubhav behatar nahin rahaa he
 After Yogi became the Chief Minister, the BJP lost the by-elections in Gorakhpur, Phulpur, Kairana Lok Sabha and Nurpur Assembly while the BJP won all four seats in the general election
 sarkaar or sanghathan ke str par upachunaav kii chunauti ko bhaajapa aam chunaav kii tarah hi le rahi he
 a challenge before the BJP is that some of its mlas who want to become mps want to contest elections on their seats to relatives
 magar party or rajya sarkaar samarpit kaaryakartaaon ko ladaane ke mood main he
 If weak candidates are defeated on the basis of recommendation, then it will not take any time to put the state government in the dock for this, the Yogis are realizing this and the organization as well
 lihaaja donon hi str par ek saath kamjor vipaksh se jang jeetne kii kavayad shuru kii gai he
 Before embarking on tours, Yogi held a meeting of the core group at his CM residence in Lucknow, BJP state president Dr
 mahendra nath pandeya or sanghathan mahaamantri sunil bansal ke saath charchaa kii
 The responsibility of 11 seats has been assigned to one minister and two ministers have been made responsible for winning the lost seat Jalalpur
 inamen yogi sarkaar main mantri rahe satyadev pachori, reeta bahuguna joshi or espi singh baghel kii siten bhi hai
 Of these, ten seats have been in the possession of the BJP
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main rampur se sapa pratyaashee ajam khan or jalalpur vidhansabha seat par basapa pratyaashee reetesh pandeya prachand modi lahar ke baavjood jite the
 In such a situation, the government and organizations are in electoral mode under a special action plan on these seats
 mantriyon or netaaon ko jimmedaari dene main in siton par muddon or jaateey samikarnon ko bhi dhyaan main rakhaa gaya he
 While the responsibility of Rampur seat has been entrusted to Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma, ministers Brajesh Pathak and Santosh Singh have been appointed to win Jalalpur (ambedkar Nagar) seat
 dipti siem keshav maury ko govindnagar, mantri shrikant sharma ko tundla, ashutosh tandon ko lakhanu kaint, daara singh chouhan ko jaidpur, ramapati shastri ko balha, or pratapgarh kii jimmedaari parivahan mantri swatantra dev singh ko di gai he
 Similarly, Mahendra Singh has been appointed to win Manikpur, Bhupendra Singh to Gangoh, Dhuni Singh to win Hamirpur
 haalanki bhaajapa ke pashchimi uttar pradesh ke pravaktaa gajendra choudhary siem ke daure ko chunavi kavayad nahin maanate hai, ve kehete hai, “samiksha kaa makasad chunaav nahin, balki prashasnic parakh karne or vikaas kaaryon ko gati dena he
 There is no one more than us in elections
 ” haalanki upi congress cameti ke varisht upaadhyaksh imran masood kehete hai, “upachunaav se pehle bhaajapa sahami hui he or haarane ke dar se sarkari mashinari ke durupyog kii kavayad kii ja rahi he
 The public knows what the review is by keeping distance from the media and opposition public representatives? ”however, soon after realizing such allegations, Chief Minister Adityanath Yogi himself called the media and negotiated at Saharanpur at 8
30 am before leaving for Moradabad
 unhone july ke ant tak pradesh main 75 hajaar karod rupee ke nivesh or paanch lakh naye rojgaron ke srijan kaa daawa kiya
 He said, “to maintain strong law and order and quality of development works, a review will be done in 18 mandals in a month
 laaparvaah afasaron ko hidaayat di gai he or karrwai kii jaaegi
 "even if the opposition parties see this by linking it to the announcement of the by-election, but it is also true that major parties like SP and BSP are unable to muster the strength to react at the moment by engaging in mutual fighting
" idhar bhaajapa kaa subai sanghathan or sarkaar ne kamjor vipaksh ko jeet kaa aadhaar maanane ke bajaae apane deele keel kaante durust karne shuru kar die hai
 This was the first time that the Chief Minister of the state made a night stay in Saharanpur apart from Gorakhpur
 ab afasaron par karrwai kii barikaryakartaaon or netaaon ko bade afasaron dwaara tarjeeh na dene kaa maamla saharanpur or muradabad main siem adityanath yogi ke saamne bhaajapa netaaon ne prabhavi dhang se uthaaya or saharanpur loksabhaa seat par hui haar ko sidhe isi se joda, lekin jis bade afasar ko iske liye jimmedaar tehraaya gaya, ve pradesh bhaajapa ke ek bade netaa ke najdiki rishtedaar hai
 But CM took it seriously and Kairana MP Pradeep Chaudhary, Gangoh assembly in-charge minister Chau
 bhupendra singh or jiladhyaksh vijendra kashyap kii ek cameti banaakar report maangi he
 Although five pharmacists of Saharanpur District Hospital and District Mineral Officer were transferred late in the night due to serious complaints a day before the Chief Minister's visit, the CM faced complaints of health services malfunction, illegal mining and illegal slaughterhouses Had to do a lot of warning to the officers

 In Delhi, where Arvind Kejriwal and his party are constantly raising EVM questions before the elections, the BJP has retweeted a tweet of 3 February 2015 by Arvind Kejriwal, saying that evms are still being accused of being spoiled by Arvind Kejriwal And were anticipating disturbances
 tab arvind kejariwal ne apane twit main aarope lagaaya tha ki dilli kaint kii seat par ek mashin main koi bhi batan dabaane par keval bijepi kii hi lite chal rahi thi yani keval bijepi ko hi vot ja rahe the
 It is noteworthy that after the counting of votes in this election, the Aam Aadmi Party candidates won 67 out of 70 seats in the Delhi Assembly and the party was formed with a historic victory in Delhi
 party ne 15 saalon tak dilli main sarkaar chalaane vaali congress ko supada saaf kar diya tha or bijepi ko aisi patkhni di thi ki vah keval teen seat par simat ke rah gai thi
 The BJP too could not get such a vote percentage that the leader gets the post of opposition, but Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party government and Arvind Kejriwal had decided to give the post of leader opposition to the BJP
 ab dilli bijepi ke pravaktaa tejinder paal singh bagga ne ek twit kar kaha he ki pehle bhi arvind kejariwal iviem kaa mudda banaate rahe hai

 Panipat Box Office Collection Day 1: The film 'panipat' by Bollywood actor Arjun Kapoor and Kriti Sanon has been released in theaters
 is film ko critics ne bhi acha rispons diya he
 There is also excitement in the audience about the film
 haalanki film ne pehle din box offis par kuch khaas pradarshan nahin kiya
 Arjun Kapoor's film was given a tough competition by Karthik Aaryan's 'pati Patni Aur Woh'
 box offis india dot com ke mutabik arjuna kapur kii film 'panipat' (panipat Box Office Collection) ne pehle din keval 3
 Have collected 5 to 4 crores
 Pati Patni Aur Woh Box Office Collection Day 1: karthik aryan kii film ne pehle din box offis par machaaya dhamal, kama daale itane karod At the same time, Arjun Kapoor and Sanjay Dutt have done amazing work in this film
 yah pehla mauka he jab donon kalakaar ek saath kisi film main hon
 Ashutosh Gowariker has also made a comeback with this film after a long time
 isse pehle ashutosh goarikar ne logon se unki aagaamee film 'panipat' (panipat) ke bare main koi bhi avadharana banane se pehle ise dekhne kaa aagrah kiya tha
 The release date of 'bhangra Pa Le' came in front, so this actor shouted outside Shah rukh-salman's bungalow- Watch Video 'panipat Trailer' was a controversy as soon as the release
 is par ashutosh ne kaha tha, "mujhe lagata he ki logon ko film dekhne kii jarurat he
 After watching the film, he will get answers to all his questions
 jab ve film dekhenge, tab ve mahasoos kar paaenge ki ise nek iraade se banaaya gaya he or film main sari acchhee baaten hi hai
 "arjun Kapoor has become a Marathi warrior in this film
 film main jahaan kriti senon (kriti Sanon) arjuna kapur kii patni bani hai,to vahiin sanjay dutt (sanjay Dutt) 'ahamed shah abdali' ke kirdaar main arjuna kapur ke dushman bane najar aa rahe hai
 The manner in which the Congress is selecting candidates for the assembly elections in five states, it is becoming clear that this party can prove to be the 'one man show' of Rahul Gandhi
 party ke itihaas main aisa pehali baar ho rahaa he jab rahul gandhi ke kad kaa netaa ek-ek tikat khud final kar rahaa ho
 If sources are to be believed, Rahul Gandhi had already surveyed his people for all the states
 jab party adhyaksh yaa pradesh congress apana panel yaa pratyaashee tikat ke liye saamne laate hai, to rahul us naam kaa milan apane gopneey survey ke naam se karaate hai
 If this name matches their list, then only the name passes
 aisa na hone par dubaara naam mangaya jaataa he
 According to sources, out of all the 17 names released so far for Chhattisgarh, most are young faces and these are leaders for whom the state leadership was not very enthusiastic
 lekin rahul ne inhen logon ko tikat dene kaa faisla kiya
 According to sources, when Chhattisgarh state Congress president Charandas Mahant reached the meeting after taking the list, he had to face tough and direct questions of Rahul
 baithak main maujuud ek netaa ne bataaya, ‘vaise to vahaan kai log maujuud the, lekin sawaal sirf rahul ji puch rahe the or mahant kisi tarah jawaab de rahe the
 'the matter is not just about Chhattisgarh
 dilli kii kaddavar mukhyamantri shila dikshit bhi isiilie pratyaashiyon kii suchi final nahin kar paa rahi hai, kyonki unki suchi ke bahut se naam rahul gandhi kii suchi se mail nahin kha rahe hai
 The effect of Rahul's promptness is that all the big leaders in Madhya Pradesh are appearing on one platform and are thinking 10 times before raising the name of the candidate
 digivajay singh jaise kaddavar netaa ne khud ko tikat vitaran se agal hi kar liya he
 First to dismiss the ordinance on tainted leaders with complete bullying and after that take complete assembly elections
 ye do aisi taaja ghatnaayen hai jo rahul gandhi kii paaramparik chhavi ko tod rahi hai
 Till now it has been believed that Rahul Gandhi has been dissuading from playing a big responsibility in active politics, but now it seems that he is ready to make a new leak

 Raja Ram Pandey then said, 'it is my good fortune that i have become the minister in charge of this district for the second time
 mujhe yahaan har baar kisi khubasurat dm ke saath kaam karne kaa mauka mila he
 When i saw Kamini Chauhan Ratan, the former DM of the district, i felt that she could not be a beautiful woman

 In the opinion of Dhakad, politics is a business in today's date and like other leaders, they too will make money after winning

 According to him, the lack of cash has hit the business

 He claims that this is the best way to overcome unemployment

 According to him, this is what the elected leaders in Agra have done so far

 This difference lies in its purpose: it is a crime if used to cover up the misdeeds and deserves praise if it is used to protect the national interest

 26 September 2011: See in pictures India Today's debate over the Right to Notification (RTI) is now embroiled in the same story
 sarkaron kaa tark he ki kuch khaas paristhitiyon main sach ko chhipaana, yahaan tak ki jhooth bolnaa unka ferj he
 We can understand
 ham yah bhi samajhte hai ki is visheshadhikaar kaa durupyog kaise hota he
 For example, in the days of war every country makes the limits of the right to lie quite flexible
 lekin rashtrabhakti ke joshokhrosh main bhi ham kisi yoddha ke palaayan ko maaf kar dete hai lekin yuddh ke bare main afvaah failaane vaale kii galatiyon ke liye sajaa dete hai
 The wounds found by George Bush and Tony Blair, who have lied to their countries to drag them into the Iraq war, are not fulfilling
 dow
 Manmohan Singh's government is fighting a war not from anyone but himself
 lekin ek badmijaaj kism kaa civil yuddh sensorship ko badhaava detaa prathit hota he
 This has deliberately started an open debate on RTI
 haalanki tamaam yuktiyon ke jariye uskaa makasad aise sanshodhan laana he, jinke jariye dastavejon tak pahunch utani aasaan na rah jaae
 Personally, this administration has agreed that the RTI wrestling license has turned into a war
 kyon? to phir iske liye sahi sawaal hoga 'abhi kyon?'artiai dow
 Singh does not have the produce but he can claim to be the guardian of this law
 2009 ke aam chunaavon ke prachaar abhiyaan main unhone ise apni ahm uplabdhiyon main ginaya or kuch atirikt vot paane main unhen madad mili
 Dr
 singh ko pehle kaarykaal main artiai se koi dikkat na thi
 How did she become a problem for him within two years of the second term? The functioning of RTI has not been any more liberal
 haalanki iske kaaryakarta chatur or hoshiyaar hote gaye hai
 In UPA 1, there is a clear distinction between pride in RTI and nervousness in UPA 2
 2009 se pehle dow
 Singh felt that he had nothing to hide
 unke mantriyon ke dushkrityon ke maano audyogic str par hue khulaason ne unka vah aatmavishvaas hawa kar diya
 The wounds of his own credibility were credited and RTI was hurt the most
 bhrashtachar in ghaavon kii jad main tha, jisane unhen nasoor bana diya
 The Commonwealth Games and 2G spectrum became a nationwide symbol of corruption
 donon maamalon main itii se mili filon ne na sirf bhandaphod kiya balki un par paradaa daale jane kii koi sambhaavna hi na chodi
 When governments talk about fixing records, a question must arise there: Who messed up the record? Before RTI, it was easy to blame the media for distorting facts
 jab mul filon kii kapiyaan haath main aane lageen to khilaaf aawaaj uthaane waalon ke swar mantriyon ke aadhe-adhure spashtikarnon se zyada pramanik lagane lage
 In our parliamentary system, lies are handled with a very fine view: a minister caught lying in the House is expected to resign, but ministers who can be removed from the truth are considered clever and competent
 artiai ne mantriyon ke liye aise kisi bachaav kii gunjaaish nahin chodi
 Dr
 singh kii sarkaar main 'secondtermitis' rog ke saare lakshan najar aa rahe hai: ek phaltu kaa rog jo jaanaleva ho saktaa he

 Until the beginning of his second term in 1971, nothing went wrong
 lekin 1973 aate-aate kuch bhi thik nahin rah gaya
 Between 1980 and 1984, his third term continued to reverberate with mistakes and violence and ended with his martyrdom
 dobaaraa chuni jane vaali sarkarein oonchi jan apekshaaon or aatmasantoshi ravaie ke bich ladkadaa jaati hai
 They believe in the illusion that the opposition is over

 Public life has many meanings in a democracy; This means not only the management of public affairs but also public management in the process
 gopneeyata kii chhatari to raksha jaise kuch vishyon par hi kaam aati he
 In other subjects of governance, this is just an excuse, not a solution, and excuses are not able to buy too much time at the current exchange rate

 Singh no longer has any government that can benefit from the manipulation of RTI, but he still has a rare reputation to lose

 He said that India is now going to be a full-time member of multilateral groups that monitor nuclear non-proliferation
 iske saath hi unhone kaha ki enesji kii daavedaari ke bharat ke aavedan ko france puraa sahyog karegaa
 Sarkozy expressed happiness over the fact that Areva, a French company, is going to set up a nuclear plant at Jaitpur in Maharashtra, which will produce 10,000 MW of 'clean energy'
 haalanki, unhone kaha ki bharat ke rukh main ‘asangati’ he kyonki ek taraf vah svachh urja viksit karnaa chahta he or duusari ore is kshetra main ‘pahunch par pratibandh’ laga rahaa he
 He said, 'we cannot pressure India to fulfill its obligations without giving us the means to fulfill the obligations

 On the other hand, sources associated with the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting say that the Ministry has given an explanation on Namo TV in its reply to the Election Commission
 mantralay kaa kahana he ki namo tivi koi license praapt channel nahin balki vigyaapan plateform he
 The ministry only licenses TV channels

 The Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party have complained to the Election Commission about how a TV supported by a political party can be allowed to air despite the imposition of a code of conduct
 is tivi ko 31 march ko launch kiya gaya tha
 There are many pm-based speeches and bjp-based videos on this channel
 aam aadmi party ne chunaav ayog se shikaayat kii thi ki aachaar samhita lagu hone ke baad bhi kisi raajnneetik party ko yah adhikaar kaise he ki vah apana khud kaa channel shuru kar sake
 The Aam Aadmi Party also asked the question as to who would monitor the content running on Namo TV
 yah bhi sawaal poocha gaya ki kya namo tivi launch karne se pehle chunaav ayog kii ijaajat lee gai thi
 Asking questions from the Election Commission, the Aam Aadmi Party has also said what action the Commission has taken against it if no permission is taken to start Namo TV
 aam aadmi party ne namo tivi channel ko aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan bataaya he
 The party has cited the name of the channel after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's short name 'namo' and said that if the Namo channel has been started without the permission of the Commission then what action has the Commission taken on it? PM on Namo TV Modi's rallies are done live broad casting

 This TV is being broadcast from house to house through various operators

 The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) acting president Vijay Kumar Malhotra cautioned the government strongly that India could be excluded from the Olympic Games if it remained adamant on bringing the National Sports Development Bill
 malhotra ne kaha ki sarkaar rashtriya khel mahasanghon ko aadesh nahin de sakati yaa un par apni sharten nahin lad sakati he
 She can only give advice, but the government is intent on controlling sports federations
 yadi aisa hota he to phir bharat ko olympic se bhi baahar kiya ja saktaa he
 The central government has prepared a new sports bill, which also has a provision to limit the age and tenure of the officials
 malhotra ne kaha ki antarrashtriya olympic samiti (iosi) ise sidhe taur par sarkaar kaa mahasanghon ke kaamkaaj main hastkshep maanati he or aise main vah bharat ke saath bhi kuwait jaisaa ravaiya hi apana sakati he
 He said what had happened to Kuwait
 
 
 uske olympic sangh kaa adhyaksh to iosi main bhi padaadhikari tha, lekin vahaan kii sarkaar sansad main koi vidheyak le ai, jise iosi ne khel sanghon ke kaamkaaj main hastkshep mana or use baahar kar diya
 The IOC has also warned India, but the government is ignoring all these things
 malhotra ne kaha, ki yahaan tak isisi (antarrashtriya cricket parishad) bhi cricket bordon ke kaamkaaj main sarkari hastkshep ke khilaaf he or usne apane sabhi board ko is bare main aagaah bhi kar diya he
 Malhotra said, the IOC has also said that India's participation in the Olympic Games and international competitions could be affected
 hamane pradhanmantri ko bhi yahi baat bataai ki yah behad gambhir masalaa he or isse hamaari landan olympic (2012) kii sari taiyaariyaan dhari kii dhari rah jaaengi
 However, in the midst of this tug of war between the governments over control of the Games, the IOA has also started preparations for the Olympic Games to be held in London from 27 July to 12 August next year
 usne iske liye jald hi vibhinn khel mahasanghon kii baithak bulaai he
 Malhotra said, "we have called a meeting on July 20 of all the sports federations whose sports are in the Olympics
" is baithak main olympic kii taiyaariyon par hi vistaar se charchaa kii jaaegi
 Some of our players have qualified
 hamaare prayaas hai ki hamaare adhik se adhik khilaadi olympic main bhaag len
 The IOA president, however, believes that the lack of stadium players prepared for the Commonwealth Games could affect the preparations
