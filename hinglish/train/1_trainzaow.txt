 unhone kaha ki isse puure krishi kshetra or khaskar kisaanon kii seva kaa dayera badhegaa
 Watch the video- azaad hindustan se pehle kashmir ek alag riyasat hua karti thi
 Then Kashmir was ruled by King Hari Singh of Dogra Rajput dynasty
 dogra rajvansh ne us daur main puri riyasat ko ek karne ke liye pehle ladakh ko jeeta tha
 Then in 1840 Kashmir was taken away from the British
 tab 40 lakh kii aabaadi vaali is kashmir riyasat kii sarahadein afghanistan, rus or china se lagati thim
 That is why this principality had special importance
 phir 1947 main aazaadee ke baad tab pakistan nayaa-nayaa bana tha
 Now there was Hindustan on one side, Pakistan on the other side and this small piece of land in the middle
 
 Kashmir
 ek aaazaad riyasat
 
 
 And this is where dastan-e-kashmir begins
 70 saal pehle
 An incest attack
 jo khatm hua ek saal do maheene ek haftaa or teen din baad
 Which changed the appearance of heaven
 jisane jananath ko jahannam banane kii buniyaad rakhi
 Who first produced the Mujahideen
 jisane kashmir kii ek nai kahani likh daali
 Gulistan, which was watered by Shamsuddin Shah Mir some 700 years ago
 unke baad tamaam nawabon or raajaaon ne jisko sajaayaa-sanvaara
 The fragrance of poplar and guldar floated in the assets and fijas
 jise aage chalakar jameen kii jananath kaa khitaab mila
 In the same Kashmir, exactly seventy years ago, the ignorance of a king and the arbitrariness of a hookman made such a poison of ammo in the fijas, the smell of which can be felt even today in Kashmir
 meraa mulk
 
 tera mulk
 
 meri jameen
 
 teri jameen, mere log
 
 tere log
 This non-human stubbornness first cut a laughing nation into two pieces
 lakhon logon ko majahab ke naam par maar daalaa gaya or phir us jananath ko bhi jahannum bana diya gaya
 Whose king requested the British to keep his princely state away from the politics of hindu-muslim with high hopes
 magar unki riyasat kii sarhadon ke najadik baithe musalamaanon ke liye pakistan banane vaale kaayade ajam mohammad ali jinna kashmir kii is aazaadee ke liye taiyaar nahin the
 His reasoning was that in view of the number of Hindu people in Junagadh, Gujarat, it was merged in India, similarly in Pakistan, according to the population of Muslims, it is entitled to Pakistan only and only
 apni isi jid ko manwaane ke liye jinna ne kashmir ke maharaja hari singh par dabaav bananaa shuru kar diya or kashmir ko jane vaali tamaam jaruri chizon kii supplai band kar di
 Pakistan now used the power to join Kashmir with itself
 maharaj hari singh akele unka muqabla nahin kar paa rahe the
 Now it seemed clear that Kashmir would be removed from their hands, as well as the state of Dogra princely state would also be over
 bhartiya sena ne dushmano ko khadedakashmir ghati ko pakistani aatankiyon se bachaane ke liye maharaja hari singh ne aakhirkaar bharat ke saath mil jane kaa faisla kiya
 The Indian army drove out the enemies
 phir is jang ke aakhri din elosi kaa janm hua
 Immediately after Maharaja Hari Singh's decision to accompany Hindustan, the Indian Army opened its front in Kashmir
 raat ke andhere main vimaan ke jariye bharat ne sena or hathiyaaron ko bina atisi ke diarection ke srinagar main utaar diya
 At that time the invading tribesmen were just a mile from Srinagar
 bhartiya sena ne sabase pehle srinagar ke ird-gird ek suraksha gheraa banaaya
 After this, the appearance of war did not take long to change
 bhartiya fouj ne laharaaya jeet kaa parachamjangi saamaan kii kamjor supplai or nakshon kii kami ke baavjood jaanbaaj bhartiya sainikon ne ek ke baad ek tamaam thikaanon se pakistani ghuspaithiyon ko khadedna shuru kar diya
 The threat of the Indian Army's rising footsteps had caused panic in the hearts of the tribes
 unamem bhagdad much chuki thi
 Hence, the army took Baramulla, Uri and its surrounding areas back from the tribes
 morcha sambhalate hi bhartiya sena ne pakistan ko ahsaas kara diya ki bharat sirf aakaar main hi nahin balki dilari main bhi pakistani se bahut bada he
 Within the next few months of assuming the front, two-thirds of Kashmir was occupied by the Indian Army
 bhartiya fouj jeet kaa paracham laharaa chuki thi
 LOC and POK separated like this, after this war, the issue of Kashmir reached the United Nations
 jiske baad 5 janvari 1949 ko sijafire kaa elaan kar diya gaya
 It was decided that the part of the troops which were in the time of ceasefire should be considered as the ceasefire line
 jise elosi kehete hai
 In this way some part of Kashmir went under the occupation of Pakistan which is today called Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (pok)
 jisamen gilgit, mirpur, mujaffarabad, baltistan shaamil hai
 It has been almost 70 years since the incident that started in 1947, which injured the war of occupation of Kashmir
 pakistan abhi bhi apni harkaton se baj nahin aa rahaa he
 The war started from 1947 to occupy the whole of Kashmir
 1949 main sijafire ke elaan ke baad elosi kii lakeer khinch chuki thi
 Even after that, the forces deployed on all the borders from Pakistan are still intact
 1949 se lekar 1965 tak kashmir ko hathiyaane ke liye pakistan koi na koi makkaari karata rahaa
 After the independence of the Indian Army, the plans of Pakistan plunged on the one hand, India was touching new heights of progress, on the other hand, on the other hand, Pakistan had put all its strength to gather arms from all over the world
 bharat se karaari shikast ke baad bhi pakistan baj nahin aayaa or usne kashmiri jihadiyon ke bhes main apni sena ke javaanon ko chori chhipe kargil kii pahadiyon par ghusaa diya
 But by running Operation Vijay, the Indian jambas destroyed the enemy's nefarious designs
 haalanki pahadiyon kii oonchai kii vajah se pakistani aatankiyon kaa saamana karne main bhartiya fouj ke saamne kai mushkilen aa rahi thim
 But the thunder of cannons India defeated the enemy
 bhartiya fouj ne 26 july 1999 ko kargil se pakistani ghuspaithiyon ko maar bhagaaya tha
 Amid the scuffle over the CBI, former Union Minister and noted journalist, Raun Shourane has launched a scathing attack on the Modi government

 habib tanwir ke nayaa theatre main abhinayta yaa abhinetriyaan to hameshaa centre main rahe lekin unka nepathy kabhi baatcheet kaa hissaa nahin ban paaya
 Especially music
 habib ne ek samvaad ke dauraan apane dal kii stri kalakaaron main se ek behtareen gayika divangat malabai sonwani ke liye kaha tha, ''maala nayaa theatre kaa 'sa' he
 Amardas Manikpuri, who was intimate with these Malabai, is also no more
 27 may kii subah 82 varsh kii avasthaa main unka nidhan ho gaya
 After joining the Naya Theater in 1971, Amardas spared the style of Rangat Habib through his tabla, which was seen by the world
 ve itane naatakon main sangat paksh par rahe, kehane ke bajaae kahana chahie, unke bina habib kaa koi bhi naatak sambhav nahin tha
 The triangle of harmonium, clarinet and tabla created such magic that even after the play, they remained a permanent part of songs and color music
 malabai mandali main mausi kehalaati thim or amardaas mausa
 Newcomers also called both of them with this address
 aakhri daur main unhen sangeet naatak academy sammaan us vakt mila jab ve jivan ke sandhyakaal main moksh kii pratiksha main apane grih gram, durg jile ke colihapuri main rah rahe the
 Having been in Habib's accompaniment for more than 40 years, and the artist who has traveled the same number of countries, never did a special act
 ekaadh baar kores main jarur dikh jaaya karte the
 His original identity was the strong, yet sweet tabla accompaniment that makes folk tunes audible
 kabhi apane pita kii nacha party main ve tabalaa bajaayaa karte the
 Dau later became a part of Mandraji's dance party
 iske baad habib ne unhen dekha or dilli bula liya
 'mane Ki' was his pillow
 nayaa theatre ke sabhi kalakaar ek na ek baar mandali chhodkar gaye lekin amardaas ta-umr date rahe
 Even after Habib's death, the congregation fell apart
 sharir ne saath dena band kiya tabhi ve ghar laute
 Now "returned to the same place" where all his ancestors have gone

 We need better data analysis and a 'dashboard' to catch a crisis like Satyam or IL&FS

 Meta was also a Raju-promoted company

 After coming to politics in 2004, Rahul Gandhi never lived in India till his birthday on June 19, 2014, when in power, he always went abroad
 jagadish sharma or ramesh datta sareekhe puraane kaaryakarta rahul kii photo ke saath dhol-nangade, pataakhe or kek ke saath congress mukhyalay ke baahar janmdin manaakar chale jate the
 Even, when he came to the Congress headquarters on June 19 in 2015 last year, Rahul met the Congressmen in the morning and left abroad only in the afternoon
 is baar badla-badla dikhaa nazarasubah 10 se 11 ke bich congress ke netaaon se mili rahul, ghar ke baahar havan bhi hua lekin is baar najaara siyaasi janmdin kaa tha
 The future presidents of the Congress, losing state-by-state elections after taking power at the center, were exchanged
 ghar ke baahar kone main ek kaaryakarta havan kar rahaa tha, uskaa ek apana khaas poster tha, jo rahul ko apana bhagwaan bataa rahaa rahaa tha
 It was written in English - Rahul is our God, then it was written in Hindi - You see God
 rahul ko adhyaksh ke rup main dekhne ko betaab kaaryakartadrasal, ye sab yun hi nahin tha, congress ke netaa 12 tughlaq len, rahul ke nivas par tay vakt yani thik 10 baje pahunch gaye
 Everyone has probably realized that, if we have to work in the Congress ahead, Rahul will be everything, not Sonia Gandhi
 congress ke varisht netaa jagadish titalar ne to saaf kaha ki, takneekee taur par rahul hi ab congress ke saare faisle kar rahe hai
 He should also be made the chairman, which will make things more common
 vahiin, puraane diggaj auskar furnandis ne to ye kah diya ki, netaa or kaaryakarta taiyaar hai, adhyaksh kab bananaa he, ye faisla rahul ko karnaa he
 Sanjay Singh, who has played a key role in bringing Congress to power in 1980 after struggling with Sanjay Gandhi in the role of General, said that this is the time like that and in the political war, Rahul is seen as General Will have to come in the role, we are all ready
 ' rahul ke ghar sonia ke rajnatik salaahkaar ahamed patel, janardan dvivedi, pi chidambaram, bhupinder hooda, mohan prakaash, seepi joshi sareekhe tamaam netaa kii maujuudagi kaaphi kuch bayaan kar rahi thi
 Everyone realized that now the Congress is running from here
 sutron ke mutabik, rahul ke daftar se kaaryakartaaon or netaaon ke liye nirdesh jari kiye gaye theah1
 Take care of simplicity on the birthday, do not make noise
 2
 The leaders meet at home and they will go and meet the workers themselves at the Congress headquarters
 3
 Do not bring any gift other than flowers, etc
 4
 Rahul will not give a statement to the media on the birthday
 wo nahin chaahate ki, janmdin ke bahaane un par raajnneeti chamakaane kaa aarope lage
 Demand to take Priyanka down for brother's help
 30 baje rahul congress mukhyalay pahunche or ek haal main gaye, jahaan line lagaakar subah se phool maala lekar aae kaaryakartaaon se ek-ek karke mulaakaat kii
 This process lasted for about 2 hours
 yahaan bhi rahul se milakar aae kaaryakartaaon ne rahul ko adhyaksh banane kii vakaalat kii
 In fact, along with the leaders, the activists have understood that Rahul will take over the reins of the party, so he also advocates Priyanka to join politics for her support, along with the demand of making Rahul the president
 puure upi main prachaar karen priyankashayad ye wo baat he, jisase wo apane dil ko tasalli dete hai or party ke anushaasan ke danda se bhi bache rahanaa chaahate hai
 Suraj Hegde, Rahul Gandhi's close aide and Congress secretary said till date, "yes, it is time that Rahul ji should take command and support Priyanka by coming to politics
" ' vahiin rahul ke kareebi purv saansad jitin prasad ne kaha ki, 'hamaari maang he ki, rahul gandhi adhyaksh bane or priyanka gandhi 2017 main puure upi main prachaar karen
 Rahul's birthday was also on Twitter, along with the big leaders of Congress, many leaders and activists congratulated Rahul Gandhi on his birthday
 badhai dene waalon main pradhanmantri modi se lekar argedy pramukh lalu yadav or bijepi pravaktaa shahanvaaj hossain bhi shaamil the
 Usually, Rahul Gandhi's Twitter handle officeofrg only says his words, people are rarely answered but this time thanks are also written to all those wishing him a happy birthday

 According to sources close to Rahul, nothing is decided yet, if he goes, he will give information by tweeting, not secretly
 vaise sutron kaa kahana he ki, sonia gandhi ko check ap ke liye videsh janaa he or sambhav he ki, rahul apni maa ke saath jaaen
 But it is not yet decided, keep an eye on the Twitter handle of Rahul Gandhi's office

 yah tark baar-baar diya jaataa he magar aise tathy andekha kar die jate hai ki bharat or nepal ke bich saamaajik, saanskrithik or aarthik sambandh kitne gahare hai
 Prime Minister Modi went to Janaki temple in Janakpur
 uske baad ve muktinath bhi jaaenge
 There was news of China's influence here last year
 nepal ke pradhanmantri oli devi devataaon main yakeen nahin karte hai
 They say that Karl Marx is everything to them
 pradhanmantri modi jis ilaake main ja rahe hai wo madhesiyon kaa ilaaka he
 There are seven provinces in Nepal
 vahaan praanton ke number hote hai
 Janakpur province is in number two and it is the only province whose Chief Minister belongs to Madhesi Party
 madhesi partiyaan pradhanmantri oli ko andeh kii nigaah se dekhati hai
 The challenge before India is that it should also instill confidence in the people of Madhes origin that it will stand up for them and also improve its relations with Nepal
 iske liye janakapur se ayodhya ke bich bas chalaai jaaegi
 Nepal is being seen from the perspective of India, so Nepal is also looking at India from its perspective
 indian express main di kathmandu post ke pramukh sampadak akhilesh upaadhyaay kaa ek lekh chapa he
 Reading this article, it seems that Nepal's diplomacy is that if India takes it seriously, then it too will take India seriously
 nepal ke kai bade project china kii madad se chal rahe hai
 India is also running but will India be able to invest in Nepal like China and will be able to complete its project on time
 akhilesh upaadhyaay ke lekh kaa saar yah he ki nepal ke pradhanmantri oli bhi kaaphi lokapriy hai, unke paas pradhanmantri modi kii tarah bhaashan kala he, oli bade bade vaade karnaa pasand karte hai, sansad main unke paas prachand bahumat he
 They have won the election on the slogan of prosperity
 nepal kolkata port ke zarie apni zarurat kii chizon kaa aayaat karata he
 He wants the Kathmandu Raxaul railroad to work faster
 kheti main bhi bharat madad kare
 Increase its productivity and reduce the import bill of Rs 200 billion food grains from India
 bharat or nepal ke pradhanmantri 900 megawatt ke hitropavar project kii aadharshila rakhenge
 It remains to be seen whether diplomacy can be changed on the basis of cultural and religious relations in today's era, how much more their role is in determining diplomatic relations than before
 ab chalate hai iran kii taraf
 In 2015, the United States, Germany, Russia, France, China and the United Kingdom entered into an agreement with Iran called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)
 is samjhaute ke tahat iran ne yah baat maani ki vah parmaanu hathiyaaron kaa nirmaan nahin karegaa
 Will not enrich uranium
 america ke raashtrapati trump ne khud ko is deal se alag kar liya he
 Trump had also criticized the deal in the US elections and promised that he would break away if he became president
 ve isse pehle paryaavaran par hue paris deal se bhi america ko alag kar chuke hai or ab iran ke saath hue chah deshon ke newclear deal se alag kar liya he
 Trump believes that Iran is still promoting uranium, that is, its ability to make nuclear weapons continues
 trump daawa karte hai ki unke paas iske tathy hai
 Perhaps their basis is the claim of Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu, in which he says that Mossad's agent has obtained many such information related to Iran's nuclear project
 jabaki is deal ke baaki desh israel or america ke daawey ko nahin maanate hai
 Trump said that if we did not stop it, then the world's terrorist organizations would also acquire nuclear weapons from Iran
 trump daawa karte hai ki is deal kii samay seemaa tay he jiske baad iran apane parmaanu kaarykram par laut aayega
 The deal took place at the time of former President Obama, Obama has said that even though the terms of the JCPOA will end with time, it will take 15 to 25 years for this to happen
 isliye zyaada chintaa karne kii zarurat nahin he
 All the claims that Trump has made in ending this deal are being refuted in American newspapers or turti
 tathyon kii gahan jaanch ho rahi he, america kaa media hairaan he ki kaise bina tathyon ko die yaa jo tathy die ja rahe hai unamem kai trutiyaan hai, iske aadhaar par trump itnaa bada faisla kar sakate hai
 America is saying that companies that do business with Iran will be fined
 aalochak desh kehete hai ki aisa hone par iran waapas parmaanu kaarykram par laut aayega
 Trump supporters say that there is more ruckus about his move, nothing happens
 paris deal ke samay bhi yahi sab kaha gaya lekin hua kuch nahin
 There is also an argument that Trump is trying to spark his declining popularity within the US through foreign policy
 america ke iran ke saath hue qaraar tod dene se bharat par kya asar padegaa
 In India too, concern is being expressed about this incident
 tippaniyan India also imports oil from Iran, followed by Iraq and Saudi Arabia

 It would have made it cheaper for India to buy oil
 america pratibandh ke kaaran agar bharat iran se tel nahin le paaya to uske liye tel kaa aayaat bill kaaphi bada ho jayega
 This will also have an impact on the value of the rupee
 pichley saptaah kii antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii keemat 76 dollar prati bairal se zyaada ho gai he
 Relations between Iran and the United States are unlikely to improve very quickly

 The essence of Akhilesh Upadhyay's article is that Nepal's Prime Minister Oli is also very popular, he has speech art like Prime Minister Modi, Oli likes to make big promises, he has a strong majority in Parliament
 ve samruddhi ke naare par chunaav jeet kar aae hai
 Nepal imports the goods it needs through Kolkata Port
 vah chahta he ki kathmandu raksol railmarg par tezi se kaam ho
 India should help in farming also
 uski utpaadakta badaye saath hi bharat se hone vaala 200 arab rupee ke khadyann kaa aayaat bill kuch kam ho
 The Prime Minister of India and Nepal will lay the foundation stone for the 900 MW Hightopower Project
 abhi dekhnaa baaki he ki kya aaj ke daur main saanskriti or dharmik sambandhon ke sahare kootneeti main badlaav ho saktaa he, kootnithik sambandhon ko tay karne main pehle kii tulana main is vakt inaki kitni bhoomika he
 Now let's move to Iran
 2015 main america, germany, rus, france, china or britain ne milakar iran ke saath ek samjhauta kiya jise Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), kehete hai
 Under the agreement, Iran agreed that it would not manufacture nuclear weapons
 uranium kaa sanvardhan nahin karegaa
 President Trump of America has distanced himself from this deal
 america chunaavon main trump ne is deal kii aalochana bhi kii thi or vaada bhi kiya tha ki raashtrapati banane par isse alag ho jaaenge
 They have already separated the US from the Paris Deal on Environment and have now separated the nuclear deal of six countries with Iran
 trump maanate hai ki iran abhi bhi uranium kaa sanvardhan kar rahaa he yani parmaanu hathiyaar banane kii kshamta uski jari he
 Trump claims he has the facts
 shaayad unka aadhaar israel ke pradhanmantri benyamin netanyahu kaa daawa he jisamen ve kehete hai ki mosaad ke agent ne iran ke parmaanu project se sambandhit aisi bahut si jaankariyaan hasil kii hai
 While the rest of the countries of this deal do not accept the claim of Israel and America
 trump ne kaha ki agar hamane ise nahin roka to duniya ke aatanki sanghathan bhi iran se parmaanu hathiyaar hasil kar lenge
 Trump claims that the deal has a deadline after which Iran will return to its nuclear program
 purv raashtrapati obama ke samay yah deal hui thi, obama ne kaha he ki JCPOA kii sharten bhale hi samay ke saath khatm ho jaaengi, magar aisa hone main 15 se 25 saal tak lag jaaenge
 So there is no need to worry too much
 is deal ko khatm karne main trump ne jitne bhi daawey kiye hai uskaa america akhabaaron main turaki vaa turaki khandan kiya ja rahaa he
 The facts are under intense scrutiny, the US media is surprised how Trump can make such a big decision on the basis of facts or the facts that are being given
 america kah rahaa he ki iran ke saath jo companiyaan kaarobaar karengi un par jurmaana lagegaa
 Critics say Iran will return to the nuclear program if this happens
 trump samarthak kehete hai ki unke kadam ko lekar hangaamaa zyaada hota he, hota kuch nahin he
 The same thing was said at the time of Paris deal but nothing happened
 ek tark yah bhi he ki trump america ke bheetar apni girti lokapriyata ko videsh niti ke zarie chamakaane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 What will be the impact on India if the US breaks the agreement with Iran? bharat main bhi is ghatana ko lekar chintaa zaahir kii ja rahi he
 The comments bharat iraq or saudi arab ke baad iran se bhi tel kaa aayaat karata he
 This February, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani came to India, he said that if India increases the import of oil from Iran, then it will give a discount on the price of carrying oil
 isse bharat ko tel khareednaa sasta padataa
 If India could not take oil from Iran due to the US embargo, then the import bill for oil would be huge
 iskaa asar rupee kii keemat par bhi padegaa
 The price of crude oil in the international market has exceeded $ 76 per barrel in the previous week
 iran or america ke bich sambandhon main bahut jaldi sudhaar hone ke asaar nahin hai
 5 in rupee value against the dollar from this January till now
 8 pratishat kii giravat ai he
 The rupee has gone from 67 rupees to 65 rupees to 67 rupees 32 paise
 duniya kii sabase kharaab pradarshan karne vaali teen mudraon main bhartiya rupaya bhi he
 Russia's ruble and Brazilian real are also doing poorly
 rupaya kamazor hota he to niryaatak khush hote hai magar ayatak pareshaan ho jate hai
 We have written this information by reading the Indian Express and Hindu newspapers
 iran agar yuddh ke halaat main ulajhata he to bharat par kya asar padegaa
 Does India continue to pursue its relations and projects with Iran, regardless of US pressure, or is there a large scale war situation in the Middle East
 madhyam shrenee ke hamale to ho hi jate hai
 Israel has launched a major attack on Iran's bases in Syria
 ek taraf america israel or saudi arab ek ho gaye hai to duusari taraf rus iran or syria
 Can any situation of a major war arise in the Middle East from here
 ab chalate hai iran kii taraf

 My Paramitra Narbhaslal has been very cannibalistic
 vah is baat main ulajh gaye hai ki kheti vaigyanik tareeke se kii jaae yaa manovaigyanik tareeke se
 Have reached my house to consult me
 maine unase kaha ki bhai dhanie kii kheti karo yaa dhan kii, main kuch bhi nahin jaanata hum
 i told them that my problem is that neither i know farming nor any successful cultivator
 ek-do baar kheti se sambandhit khabar kii padtaal ke liye gaya jarur hum lekin pataa sirf do baat hi chal saki
 Firstly, farming is no longer beneficial and secondly if there are farmers then the possibility of suicide is strong
 modi sarkaar aane ke baad ek or nai baat dilli ke air condishand kamare main baith-baithe khud hi pataa chal gai ki kisaan sirf, kisaan nahin he vah ab anndaata kaa tamgaa paa chukaa he
 While sitting, i have also come to know that the farmer is earning twice as much as the cost of his crop
 dedh guna to ho chuki he
 However, there is a trick in this that one and a half times or two times the income is not due to the crop, but through direct cash transfer
 diarect cash transfar vaali baat mujhe kisaanon se pataa nahin chali
 Rather, i came to know from the advertisement that thousands of crores have been spent in newspapers
 televijan par to ek bilkul kisaan-sa dikhne vaala kisaan yah kah rahaa tha ki sarkaar do hajaar rupe advance main de chuki he
 The remaining 4 thousand years are going to end
 meri baat sunakar narbhasalal kii ankhen chamak uthin
 They hugged me and said, "man, the knowledge you have will be as much as agricultural scientists
 ''maine unhen phir kaha ki bhai main dilli ke airkandishand kamare main baith kar kheti ke bare main kya bataa saktaa hum?is baar narbhasalal thode naaraaz hue
 He said, "do you think i am crazy? bada-bada research karne vaala bhi thode na pasinaa main lathpath hokar research karata he
 He also does research by sitting in an air-conditioned room
 kheti-kisaani ko phydemand banane kii tarkeeb nikaalata he
 And what does the air-conditioned room bully show
 ek windo aisi laga liya he kamare main to bada baari aadmi khud ko samajhane laga he
 a man more educated than you sits in an all-centralized air-conditioned room
 vahaan se kisaanon ke liye centrelised skim sab nikaalata he
 i know your status isliye dhaniyaan kii kheti ko lekar thodaa charchaa karne aayaa hum or tum dhaniyaan bo-kar meraa mode bigaadane main lag gaye
 "well, to get rid of Narbhaslal's displeasure, i asked him to first say what you want about coriander?" Narbhaslal just turned on
 unhone kaha, "dekho, dhaniyaan to dhaniyaan he
 Splash the brother-in-law in the field ugna to he hi use
 If you do not grow, where will you go? ab jo dhaniyaan chhintane bharase ug aae uske liye vaigyanik kheti kaa kya matlab? vaigyanik kheti main pehle mitti khodo, phir use samastipur le jaao
 Whether the coriander will get the soil tested
 agar test main yah pataa chal gaya ki dhaniyaan ugega to phir khet jutwaao, kyaariyaan banbaao
 Then take care and there is too much trouble
 aisa karne se dhaniyaan ugane kaa laagat badhegaa
 Suppose if the government transfers direct cash then what is the use? isliye mujhe lagata he ki vaigyanik tareeke se dhaniyaan kii kheti karne se behatar he manovaigyanik tareeke se dhaniyaan kii kheti kiya jaae
 "I asked what was meant in a psychological way? Narbhaslal started telling
 unhone kaha, "acha, yah bataao kii dhaniyaan ko tum kitna jaanate ho?"main samajha nahin to unhone bataanaa shuru kiya, "dekho dhaniyaan bechaari paidaa hoti hi he khota kismat lekar
 If you want it, you can also call it unfortunate
 dhaniyaan jab ugti he to hari-hari badi sundar dikhti he
 It is tempted to make coriander sauce
 dhaniyaan kii chatnee banane vaali maid main bhi zyaadaatar kaa naam dhaniyaan ho saktaa he
 Many women in the village get the name of Dhaniya ki Mai
 hamaare gaanv main mazdooree karne vaali ek mahila kaa naam durga tha
 The daughter born to his house was named Dhaniya
 us din se durga kaa naam badal gaya
 She has now come to know the entire village by the name of Dhaniya's mother
 yah he dhaniya kaa power
 Well, when the coriander rises, they then uproot it and sell it in the market
 lekin dhaniyaan kii kismat dekho
 Nobody is ready to buy coriander directly
 dhaniyaan ke bagal main rakhaa aalu, bangan, lowki, kaddu or pataa nahin koun-koun si sabji sab kharidte hai
 And then the misfortune of coriander starts
 ek pav bagon kharidne vaala bhi fokat main thodi si dhaniyaan dene kii jid thaanta he
 The person who has bought kilos of onions shows so much authority over coriander as if he is a bonded laborer of buying the produce
 pachaas-sau gram dhaniyaan to vah yun hi uthaa letaa he
 Many shopkeepers also keep ahead to sell the misfortune of unfortunate coriander
 graahakon ko hari-hari dhaniyaan dikhaakar apni sadi hui sabji bech daalate hai
 Now if fresh coriander is sold with two kilos of rotten tomatoes, how can there be any problem? mujhe achraj main dekh narbhasalal bole, "ab shuru hota he dhaniyaan kii manouvaigyanik kheti
 Its first step is to not call coriander as coriander and call it the English language name Corriander
 koriender shabd main hi power he
 The second step is to say that i am cultivating coriander
 yah bolnaa shuru karo ki koriender kii farming kar rahe hai
 As soon as the farm is made, farm farming and coriander coriander, you automatically fall into the category of scientific farmer
 aglaa step he ki dhaniyaan, maaf karnaa koriender ko haat-bazaar main mat becho
 Take her to the Vegetable Shop at Air Conditioned Mall
 vahaan bada board lagaao fres koriender, diarect fram farm
 That's all there is to do
 itnaa karte hi dhaniyaan khud ba khud itani powerful ho jaaegi kii use bikne ke liye kisi bagon yaa tamaato kii jarurat nahin hogi
 It will have its own existence
 tamaato yaa bagon bhi unke dam par bikne lagegaa
 Just as there is a need for social transformation in the society, the transformation of vegetables is also needed
 "mujhe narbhasalal kii baat main dam dikhaa
 There was a glow on my face
 mujhe unka idia pasand aa gaya
 i said, "man, you cultivate coriander in a very psychological way
 "narbhasalal prasann hue
 He continued, "then it was decided that i now start farming of Cariander tomorrow itself
 dekhnaa tum bahut jald hi main tivi par najar aauungaa
 My name will be printed in the newspaper
 dhaniyaan se kaariender tak kii mere sangharsh kii kahani chhapegi
 When the news of farmer suicides is published, the farmers' movement will make the government face, then i will see, as a positive face of the farmer, i will be spread across the country
 bade bade mantri santari meri sangharsh kii kahani apni jubaani baatayengen
 It is a different matter that in the chowk-chaupals, in the farm-barns, while the farmers continue to wait for the money of the Direct Benefit Scheme, i have serious discussion in the seminars of the Panchatara Hotel, in the Debate of the Klab House and in the Ayas parties in the Farm House
 Will be the subject
 "yah kehete hue narbhasalal, lambii dag bharte hue mere ghar se baahar ja chuke the
 (sujit Thakur is the Assistant Editor of India Today) *** agar sehatmand or feet rahane kii tamanna he to aage kii taraf bhaagane kii bajaay peeche kii taraf bhaagane kaa abhyaas kiijie
 This will relieve joint pain and will consume more calories
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki peeche kii taraf bhaagane se jodon par kam dabaav padataa he, jisase ghutane or peeth main dard kii samasya main kami aati he or yah fitness kii taraf badhane kaa ek aasaan rasta he
 According to a study by Oregon University, people who run backwards can earn the same fitness benefits by spending 80 percent of their energy compared to those who run forward
 daily mail ne dakshin africa main stellenbosh univarsity ke ek anya adhyayan ke hawaale se khabar di he ki peeche kii taraf daudane kii takanic se dil kii sehat bhi thik rahati he
 During this study, the researchers studied the effects of the program on running backwards three times a week for six weeks
 iske saath ek samooh ko uski saamaanya gatividhiyaan jari rakhane ko kaha gaya
 After the study, it was found that there was a significant reduction in the oxygen consumption of the girls running backwards, which meant that they were less tired during physical activities and they averaged 2
 5 pratishat body fat kam kiya
 In the UK, James Bamber, who organized a race to run backwards, says that there are many more advantages to running this way
 chunki peeche kii taraf daudane par aap pair ke agle bhaag par apana bhaar daalate hai isliye isse aapkaa panja majboot hota he or aapkaa poshchar behatar hota he
 The newspaper quoted him as saying that by doing this kind of exercise, the heart is better and the body remains agile
 bambar ke anusaar peeche kii taraf daudane vaale logon ko ek nirdhaarit duuri tak daud lagane se jitna laabh miltaa he vah saamaanya rup se aage kii taraf daudane waalon ko usase chah guna duuri tak daud lagane se miltaa he
 Similarly, filling 100 steps in the rear gives the same benefit as filling 1000 steps in the front

 america ke ek bhuvaigyanik ne daawa kiya he ki usne use dhund nikaala he
 It has been claimed that the new base of Osama bin Laden has been discovered and that place is Parachinar in Pakistan
 america ke ek research group kii report par yakeen karen to parachinar hi wo ilaaka he jahaan osama ne sharan le rakhi he
 Geologists Thomas Geelaspie of the University of California said in his report that Osama bin Laden may have been hidden in one of the three compounds of Parachinar and that Geelaspie's report was taken from photographs taken from the US intelligence satellite and geophysical analytical tools Has been prepared with help
 ye ek aisi takanic he jiske istemaal se kai shaatir faraar aparaadhiyon ke thikaanon kaa pataa lagaaya ja chukaa he
 Pakistan's Parachinar is just 18 kilometers from the border of Afghanistan and the distance from the Torabora hills of Jalalabad, where Osama bin Laden was last seen
 dystence dike theory ke mutabik bhagode aparaadhiyon ke unheen ilaakon main paae jane kii gunjaaish zyada hoti he jahaan unhen aakhri baar dekha gaya tha

 unka kahana he ki pichley kuch saalon main media main chhapi report ke aadhaar par osama bin laden kii aadaton auki uski shakhsiyat ke bare main jitani jaankaree hasil hui he use satellite ke jariye khufia nigaraanee ke dauraan bhi dhyaan main rakhaa gaya he

 Jillespie believes that a vicious terrorist like Osama would not want to imprison himself in a mountain cave
 use talash hogi aisi jagah kii jahaan se uske liye nikal bhaagna bhi aasaan ho or chhipe rahanaa bhi
 Therefore, Osama is more likely to lurk in such small border towns instead of hill caves

 Here, understanding of the situation can give a slight edge to the Caribbean team

 The said police officer said, "these people could not open the doors of the car and carbon dioxide gas was filled inside

 Amar Kaushik, the director of the upcoming horror-comedy film 'stree', recounted a shocking incident while sharing the film's shooting experience
 nirdeshak amar kowshik kaa kahana he ki shooting ke samay shraddha kapur or rajkumaar raav ko kai tarah ke ajeeb anubhavon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 During the night shooting, the local people warned the team not to shoot on this road at night while shooting in Chanderi, a small town in Madhya Pradesh
 lekin team ne unki ek nahin suni or raat main shooting chaalu rakhi
 Is the copy of this Hollywood film the poster of Rajkumar Rao's film? Then, during the shooting, suddenly there were many strange incidents
 jaise pehle to camere kaa focus pular thik se kaam nahin kar paa rahaa tha
 After this, electricity was coming in, due to which its bulb also started to trouble
 diarector ne kaha, 'hamaari shooting ke ek din pehle kuch sthaneey log mere paas aae or kaha ki ham jis sadak par shooting kar rahe hai, wo honted he or vahaan koi nahin jaataa
 Even after the villagers refused, the makers decided to shoot the film without considering it
 rajkumaar raav or shraddha kapur ke alaava stri film main actor pankaj treepathi bhi ahm kirdaar main najar aa rahe hai
 The film is going to release on 31 August
 dance bhi karte hai rajkumaar-pankaj treepathi, stri ke nae gane main dekh lensei ghatana par he filofilm ke tiger main ek gramin ilaake main deevaaron par likhaa bataaya gaya he 'o stri kal aana'
 Finally a woman's legs are shown
 film kii tag line he, ab har mard ko dard hoga
 Which shows that in the film, the woman's enmity against the men is told
 stri kaa nirdesan amar kowshik kar rahe hai
 It is being told based on a true story
 dekhen stri kaa trailor: After the Indian Air Force air strike against terrorists, Pakistan has dared to respond
 bhartiya vayusena ne phir pakistan ko jawaab diya he or uske hamale ko naakaam kar diya he
 The Indian Foreign Ministry has officially confirmed this
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne bataaya ki hamane pukhta saboot hone ke baad jaish ke aatankiyon ke khilaaf mangalvaar ko ection liya tha, jiske jawaab main aaj (buudhvaar) pakistani vayusena ne bhartiya sena ko nishaanaa banane kaa prayaas kiya
 Ravish Kumar said that our Air Force was on alert, due to which Pakistan's efforts were thwarted and its aircraft was demolished by our mig-21
 videsh mantralay kaa yah bayaan pakistan ke us daawey par bhi chot he, jisamen usne kaha he ki hamaare kisi vimaan ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaa he
 The Government of India has unleashed the lies of Pakistan, and the Foreign Ministry has made it clear that our mig-21 has demolished the aircraft of Pakistani Air Force in the air
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne yah bhi bataaya ki bhartiya javaanon ne yah dekha ki hawa main pakistani aircraft par hamale ke baad vah dhwast ho gaya or use pakistan kii sarhad main girte dekha gaya
 Pakistan Army denying aircraft claimed to be destroyed, Indian Air Force on Wednesday morning shot down Pakistan Air Force F-16 fighter aircraft in Rajouri area of jammu region
 sena ke adhikariyon ne bataaya ki is vimaan ko rajouri ke jhaangadh ilaake main dhwast kiya gaya
 At the same time, the Pakistani army rejected India's claim that India has not dropped any F16, we did not use it in this operation
 paak sena ke pravaktaa asif gafoor ne kaha ki vah chaahate to bhartiya sena ke thikaanon or prashasnic daftaron ko nishaanaa bana sakate the, lekin hamane kisi ko bhi nuksaan pahunchane kii koshish nahin kii
 When Arvind Gobind Ram Kejriwal won the trust of the people of Delhi and stood on the podium to take the oath of constitution for the second time on February 14, the pictures of his ridicule which was blown inside the Delhi Legislative Assembly a year ago must have flashed when today's The day he resigned as the seventh chief minister of the state
 ''kejariwal jhootha he,'' yahi vah tippanee thi jo us vakt congress or bijepi ke sabhi 42 chune hue vidhayakon ne ek swar main kejariwal par isliye uchhaali thi kyonki ve rajya ke logon ko har tarah ke bhrashtachar se mukti dilaane ke uddeshy se laae gaye apane lokapal vidheyak ke liye samarthan juta paane main naakaam rahe the or isi ke chalate istipha dekar mahaj 49 dinon main apni sarkaar ko qurbaan kar diya tha
 After that, the blood, sweat and tears that Kejriwal has shed over the last year, may give some relief to the thousands of Delhiites who gathered at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi on February 14 and their new faith
 phir, pichhali garmiyon main uttar pradesh ke varanasi main bijepi ke netaa or tab pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ke haathon loksabhaa chunaav main unhen jo sharmindagi jhelni padi thi, ve jis tarah rond die gaye the, shaayad usase mili unke jakhmon ko bhi kuch raahat mil sake
 The lukewarm outcry in his support of the people of Delhi and the opportunity given to him to rule again may make Kejriwal think that Fatah's voice, his sweet smell and sweet taste would have been exactly like this! About three years Earlier, on the India Against Corruption front, 47-year-old Kejriwal declared that "all leaders are thieves, throw them in front of the vultures
" '' isko teen saal se kam vakt gujara hoga ki enjio ke is activist ne apane vam rujhaan vaale svaichhik kaaryakartaaon kii bikhri hui bheed ko kisi tarah jutakar aam aadmi party banaai, jisane modi kii taqatvar bijepi ko lalkaarane kaa saahas kar daalaa
 These things are now a part of history
 sirf nau maheene pehle tak modi us shaks kaa naam tha jo galtiyaan nahin karata tha
 Annoyed by the fall of the Delhi Durbar, he remained an Agiabatala, grazing hypocrites and family members on the entire political landscape
 pradhanmantri banane ke baad haalanki ve satta ke dushchakra main aise fanse ki ve or unki bijepi kamobesh bilkul usee patan kaa paryaay jaan padane lagi, jise kabhi upie kii jagiradaari mana jaataa tha
 There is no doubt that in these nine months Modi has not let even a moment of any scandal pass through him
 darasal unhen sabase zyada nuksaan logon kii badalati hui is dharna ne pahunchaaya he ki ve ek vinamr chaiwale kaa bana tyagkar ab khud ko ek aisa netaa maanane lage hai, jo khud ko duniya ke adhiktar taqatvar netaaon ke baraabar maanata he
 a large part of the votes in favor of Kejriwal in Delhi were undoubtedly anti-modi stakes
 kejariwal kii ahmiyat is baat main he ki aap ne modi ke saath vahi kiya he jo modi ne pichley dinon congress ke saath kiya tha-dilli main modi ko unhone aisi kuhani maari jo kisi hathode kii maar se kam nahin he
 Suddenly it seems that Modi's stature has become smaller
 vidambnaa dekhie ki mafalar vaala aadmi bhayankar madhumeh or vaikalpik raajnneeti kii sanak kaa shikaar he jisane ek aise shaks ko lalkaar kar thithka diya he jo apane naam kii kadhai vaala bandgala suut pahentaa he
 At the moment, there is a sense of civility that there has been a welcome dialogue between Kejriwal and Modi
 mukhyamantri ne apni shapath se do din pehle pradhanmantri se mulaakaat kii or camere donon ke chehron par faili muskaraahat ke myne kaid karte dikhe
 Modi, however, has not yet forgotten how Kejriwal challenged him in his stronghold Gandhinagar in March last year
 or saamaajik-aarthik aankadon ke maamle main gujarat ke sheersh paaydaan par hone kaa daawa todate hue un par mukesh ambani kii reliance industries or adani samooh ko phayda pahunchane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 The constant incineration of this confrontation between Modi and Kejriwal by television cameras made it clear that the Delhi-based mufflerman had become a headache for the Sardar of Gujarat
 banaras kii jang ke baad modi maan chuke the ki unhone diwaar par likhi kejariwal naamak ibaarat ko dho-ponch kar saaf kar daalaa he lekin dilli ke maidan main kejariwal ne bijepi ke paale main phir se gend daal di or use foohad pratikriyaayein dene ko vivash kar diya
 The party which challenged the establishment with such courage in May last year, had now become the power itself and was being mistaken for mistake
 chaahe vah dilli ke chunaav ko itane lambey samay tak taale rakhane kaa faisla rahaa ho, jitne main modi kaa jaadu chhiz jaataa yaa phir chunaav main party ke sthaneey netaaon or kaaryakartaaon kii bhaawanaaon kii parvaah na karke kiran bedi ko achaanak hawa main se utaarne kaa nirnay, is baar galatiyon kii bharmaar hui
 According to senior AAP leader Yogendra Yadav, "when the BJP decided to take off and hand over the command to Bedi, we understood that we were safe because Bedi would do herself and get caught up in the saying
" ''desh main modi kaa raaj kaayam hone ke baad dilli chunaavon main pehali baar aisa laga jaise kejariwal hamen yah dikhaa rahe hon ki chijen modi ke haath se ab nikal chuki hai
 Despite this, after the election results of aap's victory on 67 of the total 70 seats in the assembly, when Kejriwal was addressing the flock of AAP supporters at his party's headquarters located in the old refugee colony of East Patel Nagar
 They are mostly talking to themselves, "the condition of Congress and BJP today is due to their arrogance
" agar ham ahamkaari hue to log paanch saal main hamen bhi aisa hi sabak sikhayenge
 We do not have to be arrogant at any cost
 isaki bajaae apane haath jodie or dilli kii janata kii seva kariye
 While starting his second innings, Kejriwal has a good idea that he has to try carefully to live up to the great aspirations and expectations that have been raised by you that cross the walls of caste, class and community
 masalan, nai sarkaar ko bhrashtachar par lagaam lagane ke liye, bijli vitaran main chori ko rokane ke liye, jal mafia ko khatm karne ke liye or kuch hajaar sisitivi camere lagaakar mahilaon kii suraksha ko badhaane ke liye teji kadam se uthaane honge
 Kejriwal has now matured and appears willing to take more patience to achieve the desired goal
 unki tazaadam party ke upar ek aghoshit aachaar samhita lagu he
 First, in the state of humiliation and calamity, keep the mind cool and the language should be moderate
 duusare, dharne kaa istemaal virodh ke aakhri aujaar ke taur par kiya jayega, jab har kism kii bahes, asahmati or vichaar kii gunjaaish khatm ho jaaegi, na ki pichley saal kii janvari kii tarah jab mahila utpeedan ke maamalon main dilli police kii niskriyata ke khilaaf mukhyamantri kejariwal or unke utsaahi pradarshnakariyon ne sansad ke aasapaas kii sadakon par hi kabja kar liya tha
 And thirdly, you will no longer behave like a jagged leftist who lives in Inquilab all the time, but rather like a market-friendly party that believes in a public-private model, where the money goes on initiatives like community toilets Is spent
 aap kii dilli ikai ke sanyojak ashutosh kehete hai, ''arvind deng shiyaoping kii tarah hai
 "he refers to the leader of the Communist Party of China who brought China on the path of economic reform
 ve kehete hai, ''unki dilchaspee isamen nahin he ki billi kaali he yaa ujali, balki isamen he ki vah chuha pakadati he yaa nahin
 They undoubtedly believe that the poor should be an essential part of economic development but they are also willing to let market forces play their part
 ''apple india ke saath kaam kar chuke dwarka ke vidhayak adarsh shastri, jo purv pradhanmantri bahadur shastri ke pote hai, ke mutabik, bajaj auto ke rajeev bajaj or infosis ke narayan murti jaise kaarobaariyon ne aap ke bajet main apane korporate soshal risponsibility ke prayaason se madad dene par sahmati jataai he
 Kejriwal's resolve to change the face of politics in the environment of the country, which is constantly becoming burdened by the nexus between corrupt politicians and unbridled businessmen, is undoubtedly a stroke of fresh air
 apane shapath grahan samaaroh ke pehle kejariwal ne ajtak ko ek saakshaatkaar main bataaya, ''paramparaagat rajnatik dal raajnneeti ko dallali yaa sangrakshan se jod dete hai
 "it has taken a full year for them to mature themselves and bring you with them here
" kejariwal ke ek kareebi bataate hai, ''pichley saal tak arvind pradarshnkaree hua karte the, jinka mood ek sarkaar chalaane kaa vastav main nahin tha
 But during a year's hard work, we got to learn many lessons and we decided that we have to play long
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki aap ke bhavishya ke bare main koi bhi charchaa ab baqayada party kii rajnatik maamalon kii samiti karegi
 Arvind himself is more confident this time and has come away with far-reaching thinking
 ''aap ne modi ke taqatvar tantra ko kaise maat di, yah kahani aap ke un ahm netaaon kii he jinhone sifer se party ko khadaa kiya-booth se lekar matdaan centre tak or ward se lekar vidhansabha sanyojak or khud kejariwal tak-jisamen kareeb 40,000 anshkalik kaaryakartaaon kii ek samoochee fouj kaa yogadan he
 Ashish Talwar's job was to keep an eye on the ground
 vishaal rajnatik reliyon kii bajaae unhen kahin zyada nikatataa vaali jansabhaon ko yojit karne main maharath hasil he
 aap's selected candidates also offered to get money from Kejriwal in exchange for tea or food from those who voluntarily wanted to pay
 chande kaa yah tarika bhi kargar sabit hua
 The decision to focus on Delhi and not to participate in the Haryana and Maharashtra elections was Kejriwal's own, for which he also brushed aside the disagreements of leaders like Yogendra Yadav who contested from Gurgaon in the Lok Sabha elections
 kejariwal kaa maananaa tha ki party kii urja ko ek rajya main jhonk dena jaruri tha
 Delhi was the ideal place for this as the AAP shook it with its experiment in December 2013 and the party's votes actually increased by 4 per cent in the Lok Sabha elections even as BJP won all the seven seats in the capital
 sanjay singh ne jaise hi ghoshnaa kii ki ek adarsh ummidavaar kii pahchaan teen ''si'' he-acha charitra (kairactor), aparaadh (criminlity) or bhrashtachar (karpshan) kaa koi aarope nahin-kejariwal haath jodakar rajdhani ke gali-mohallon main nikal pade or logon se 49 din main istipha dene par maafee maangane lage
 Wherever he went, he said, "I have made a mistake, not committed a crime
" ''puri dilli sakate main thi
 After all, who has ever seen or heard any leader apologizing before this? During this time Ashish Khaitan was organizing Delhi Dialogue on water, education, youth, land related issues and safety of women, thereby creating a new layer of dialogue
 People were feeling that there is a party that is asking them to give their needs in their promises and announcements
 aap ke netaaon ne jab bahari dilli ke 13 gramin kshetron main prachaar kiya, jo pichhali baar yani pichley vidhansabha chunaav main iske prati udaar nahin rahi thi, tab unhone bijepi dwaara bhoomi adhigrahan par jari adhyadesh kaa puraa istemaal kiya jiske tahat sarkaar ko saarvajanik prayog ke liye jameen le lene kii puri chhot he
 And for this, the consent of farmers has also been removed from the law
 aap ne samajhaayaa ki sarkaar kisaan kii jameen lekar udyogpatiyon or amiron ko dena chaahati he
 With this, Ankit Lal prepared a huge campaign on social media and with the help of student activists, he made a tremendous presence on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram
 yah bijepi ke apane soshal media abhiyaan ko chunauti de rahaa tha
 The manner in which Kejriwal & Co
 has acquired political land in Delhi, questions are being raised whether this victory will have any effect in other places in the country, especially in metros like Bengaluru and Mumbai
 sataha par dekhen to bijepi kaa virodh kar rahe kshatrapon ko kejariwal kii jeet se kaaphi bal mila he
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray called it a 'tsunami wave' in Delhi, while Trinamool Congress spokesman Derek o'brien said that 2015 will be the year of 'bhaag Modi Bhaag'
 nitish kumaar ne bihar main apane ladane kii gunjaaish ko barkaraar rakhte hue kejariwal ko badhai di ki unhone ummid kii ek kiran jagaai he
 Mamta Banerjee also congratulated the first support and then the victory
 mamata ne kaha, yah ahankaar kii haar he
 The AAP leaders, however, are understanding the importance of the opportunity this time and that is why they would not want to stake their achievements for any immediate benefit
 kejariwal ke ek kareebi ne bataaya ki aap 25 farvari ko punjab main nagar nigam ke chunaav nahin ladegi, na hi dhuree ke upachunaav main kisi ko utaaregi, bhale hi sthaneey netritv kuch bhi kahe
 He, however, conceded that the AAP could prepare for the Punjab Assembly elections to be held in 2017 as its ground is already ready there - the AAP has four mps and a long and long history of the struggles of the Left parties in the state
 unhone bataaya, ''ham pehle dilli main khud ko majboot karenge kyonki agar hamane ise dhilaa chhod diya to aglaa koi bhi chunaav ladane kii hamaari ummid jaati rahegi or ham modi ko bhi chunauti nahin de paaenge
 "similarly, you will not contest municipal elections in Mumbai in 2017, will not field anyone in the by-elections in Uttarakhand and will not support Nitish Kumar in Bihar either
" aap ke netaa ne is baat par jor diya ki party zyada halkon main khud ko nahin failaana chaahati he, jaisaa ki usne 2014 ke aam chunaavon main kiya tha jab 40 karod rupaya kharch ho gaya lekin dikhaane ke liye kuch khaas nahin tha
 Apart from this, he has no need to enter the caste-centric elections of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh because the AAP does not have any organization there and that is why he does not even have a name
 yani philhal apane garh dilli ko majboot kiye bina vah desh ke kisi or hisse main apane paanv nahin failaaegi, chaahe desh bhar ke vibhinn janandolanon main sakriy log kuch bhi daleelein dete rahen
 As far as Delhi is concerned, Kejriwal pointed out that BJP had 32 in this election
 2 fisadi vot hasil kiye hai jiskaa matlab he ki modi or bijepi kaa samarthan ab bhi yahaan maujuud he jo kabhi bhi aap ke liye chunauti paidaa kar saktaa he
 Along with uniting the poor sections, Kejriwal knew that he had to show his new middle class supporters that they would continue to support Modi at the Center
 philhal ke liye, yah sthiti durust rahane vaali he
 The question from Delhi is, how long will it last? Should not the rebellious DNA of Kejriwal again erupt and they should not stage any demonstration with publicity value? Who knows, when will they go to take a dip in the Ganges and challenge Modi in their own stronghold on the same pretext? Kejriwal's friends say on this question, "better they first clean the Yamuna in Delhi which has become a sewer
" ganga ko saaf karne kii baat man se abhi hataa den
 However, when he is taking the oath for the second time in the last 15 months, he seems to have reinvented himself to take charge of the city, which is the essence of the whole of India
 aap ke netaa is baat par jor dete hai ki aane vaale dinon main jo chunautiyaan aaengi unke liye ve apni chamadi moti karne main jute hai
 They are well aware that if missed this time, then there will not be a chance
 afgaan balon ne samrik rup se mahatvapurn uttari kunduj shahar ko ek baar phir apane niyantran main le liya
 The nato-trained army freed the city from Taliban occupation after a three-day struggle
 afghanistan ke aantarik maamalon ke mantri ke pravaktaa sidi siddki ne twitor par kaha ki sarkaar ne shahar ko phir se apane kabje main le liya he
 During this time a large number of Taliban militants were killed
 taliban aatankwaadiyon ne somvaar ko kunduj shahar par kabja kar liya tha
 US forces stationed in Afghanistan also carried out airstrikes on Taliban militants to assist the security forces
 jiske baad surakshabalon ko bad mil saki
 The Taliban's occupation of the provincial capital temporarily indicates that radical insurgency may spread beyond the country's rural strongholds
 ankhon ke saamne jawan bete kii laash padi ho or koi baap use apana betaa kehane se bhi manaa kar de
 Does this ever happen? This is the story of one such father who not only said this, but refused to even touch the dead body of the son
 yakeenan jite-ji is bete ne apni baap ko aisi chot pahunchaai thi ki maut ke baad bhi kaath pad chuke kaleje se muhabbat nahin phooti
 Two drops did not spill from the eyes
 lekin aaj is baap ko puraa hindustan salaam kar rahaa he
 Do you know why? Because he is the patriotic father of a traitor terrorist
 sartaaj par najasartaaj ahamed ko aaj puraa desh salaam kar rahaa he
 Because he made a decision that surprised and shocked everyone
 darasal, sartaaj ahamed usee aatanki safullaah ke pita hai, jise upi aties ne lakhanu main encounter ke dauraan maar giraaya tha
 You cannot even guess that by seeing his face he has lost his young son
 sartaaj kehete hai ki kise apni aulad se muhabbat nahin hoti
 He loved his son as a father
 lekin dhai teen maheene ke dauraan kisne uskaa brinwash kar diya, unhen bhi samaj main nahin aayaa
 They say that a son who does not work in the interest of the country, we cannot call such a son
 aatanki kaa koi dharm nahin hota, chaahe wo hindu ho yaa musalmaan
 The family also tried to explain what happened in Thakurganj, Lucknow on Tuesday
 duniya ne dekha ki kis tarah gyaarah ghante tak donon taraf se rah-rah kar hui golibari ke baad aatankwaadi safullaah ko upi aties ne maar giraaya
 And the world also saw how before that last bullet of death, a last attempt was made by Saifullah's family to get weapons from him
 bete kii laash lene se kiya inkarlekin ghatana ke duusare din safullaah ke pita sartaaj ahamed ne jo stand liya, vaisaa aam taur par dekhne ko nahin miltaa
 Yes, Saifullah's father not only refused to see his dead son's face, but also said that he and his family no longer needed even their son's corpse
 kyonki bete ne mulk se gaddari kii he
 The son has worked against the country
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki kanpur ke is parivaar kaa darja ek aatankwaadi se taalluk rakhane ke baavjood sabaki nigahon main bahut upar ho gaya he
 Something so high that through all the common people and political contributions of the country, even the Home Minister of the country is saluting this family and this father
 inase sahanubhuti jataa rahe hai
 Instructing those who have gone astray with their sons, is the story of young men wandering in the dark world of terror, of their fate, and of a father who is presenting the Nazir after this fate
 vaaki aatanki safullaah ke deshbhakt pita sartaaj par aaj hindustan ko naaz he
 They say that they are proud, the decision they took is absolutely right
 shaayad sartaaj ahamed jaise log hi hai, jinaki badaulat tamaam napak nigahon ke baavjood hindustan kaayam he
 The ganga-jamni Tehzeeb of India continues
 wo kehete hai ki agar koi sahi tareeqe se islam dharm ko samaj le, to wo bhi aisi hi baaten karegaa
 He said that those who are supporting their lost sons, they should still be careful
 ghar chhodkar chalaa gaya tha safullahkareeb dhai maheene pehle sartaaj se unke bete safulla kii kaaphi anban ho gai thi
 The family also taught Saifullah an accounting job
 lekin uskaa dhyaan kaam par nahin tha
 which one day Sartaj not only ripped off his son, but also put two to four moons
 iske baad safulla unke peeche gusse main apana ghar chhod kar chalaa gaya
 Then Sartaj, along with his sons, decided not to let Ainda Saifullah enter the house
 lekin ghar se bhaagane vaala safulla ek rose apni is nai pahchaan ke saath sabake saamne namoodaar hoga, ye unhone kabhi khwaabon main bhi nahin sochaa tha

 The first explosion is said to be mobile bursting
 lekin chand ghante guzarate-guzarate mauka-e-vaardaat ke halaat ye ishaara karne lagate hai ki ye koi haadasa nahin balki saazish kaa dhamaakaa he
 Terrorist intrigue is behind this
 dopaher 2
 At 30, Pipariya, Madhya Pradesh, the secret of the explosion in the Bopal Ujjain passenger train was now quite open
 ye baat saafe ho chuki thi ki hamale ke peeche aatanki saazish he
 But after five hours of the attack, the police in Madhya Pradesh's Pipariya also reached the three people who are accused of placing bombs in the train
 ji haa, pipe bam rakhane kaa
 Their names are Mohammad Danish alias Zafar, Syed Mir Hussain alias Hamza and Mohammad Faisal Khan
 pataa chalaa ki teenon upi ke hi rahane vaale hai
 And all three had reached Bhopal one night before by train
 dopaher 3
 At 30 pm, three people are arrested in Thakurganj, Lucknow
 There is a shocking news from Lucknow, the capital of UP
 khabar thakurganj ke ek makaan main ek aatanki ke chupe hone kii thi
 Then upon seeing the UP ATS sieges this house
 or puure gyaarah ghante tak chale zordaar encounter main police is makaan main chupe aatanki safulla ko maar giraati he
 On the other hand, in a separate action in UP itself, the ATS arrests two more suspected terrorists Faisal Khan and Mohammad Imran associated with this module of terrorists from Kanpur, while Fakre Alam alias Rishu is arrested from Etawah
 lekin aatank kaa ye nayaa modul abhi dhwast nahin hua he
 Because right now the two important faces associated with this module, including the mastermind of this module, were still out of police custody
 guuruuvaardopaher 3
 15 Bazelkhanau, Uttar Pradesh After this, the time of two full days passes and then the news comes out, which was probably awaited by everyone
 khabar thi is modul ke mastermind samet iske donon aatankiyon ke pakade jane kii
 The UP ATS clarified that they have succeeded in arresting Gaus Mohammad Khan and his partner Azhar, the mastermind of this latest module of terror, who hails from Kanpur
 ji haa, us gaus ko jisane in tamaam naujavaanon ko dehshat kii andhi gali main jhonka or jo mangalvaar ko encounter vaali jagah se ain maukey par bhaag niklaa
 The enemy became a fighting person for the country, when he became an enemy of the country while taking the enemies to the country, his own family did not even know
 upi police ke hathe chadha khurasaan modul kaa mastermind darasal ek aisa faujee he, jisane solah saalon tak airforce main kaam kiya
 But then suddenly he separated his world
 wo gharavaalon se alag rahane laga
 And that laid the foundation for the Khorasan module in India
 mangalvaar ko lakhanu main safullah ke accounter se ain pehle tak wo encounterwali jagah yani usee makaan main maujuud tha
 Two new faces of terror, Gauss Mohammad Khan and Azhar are the two faces to reach out to which all intelligence and security agencies of the entire country along with UP ATS have put their full force
 uttar pradesh police ko beshak ab tak aatank ke is nae modul ke sidhe iesas jude hone ke koi subut naa mili hon, lekin khurasaan modul ke naam par badnaam aatank kii is nai mandali main in do chehron kaa apana alag mukaam tha
 According to the police, the former Airman resident of Kanpur, Gaus Mohammad Khan, is the person who started this new module of terror in India and tricked many youths of UP one after the other
 gaus ke gharavaalon kii maane to wo qareeb do saalon se apane ghar kanpur se dur lakhanu main hi kisi khufia thikaane par rahata tha
 He used to name himself Karan Khatri to avoid the police
 khurasaan modul benakabadoosraa sandigdh azhar is modul main visphotakon or hathiyaaron kii supplai ke saath-saath aatankiyon ke liye rahane thaharne kaa intazaam karata tha
 Almost all the terrorists associated with this module of terror must have been caught immediately after the first blast in Madhya Pradesh
 or is khurasaan modul kaa pardaafash ho chukaa ho, lekin in sandigdhon se baraamad chizein or poochtacha main saamne aae iraade hi rongte khadey karne ke liye kaafii hai
 Considering the conspiracy to terrorize India, these terrorists had not only created a dreadful conspiracy to terrorize different cities of India and especially UP, but their work was distributed among everyone
 kanpur se giraftaar kiye gaye mohammad faisal ke paas se pressure cooker or mobile bam banane ke video mili hai
 The weapons, maps, flags and other items recovered from Saifullah's hideout
 wo bhi apane-aap main is khurasaan modul kii asaliyat bayaan karte hai
 Authorities also found five boys during the search operation, two of whom are minors
 mehara ne kaha, “hamen paanch ladke mili jinamein se do naaballig hai
 The minor boys hail from Kaithal in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh
 donon ko jila bal suraksha adhikari ko saunp diya gaya he

 Minister of State for Environment Mahesh Sharma has almost rejected the demand of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in which Kejriwal demanded that water be thrown from the helicopters over the city to eliminate the dangerous forms of pollution in Delhi
 kejariwal ne centre sarkaar ko patr likhakar yah maang kii thi ki wo dilli kaa pradooshan khatm karne ke liye helicopteron se pani barasaaye jane kaa intjaam karnaa chaahate hai
 Kejriwal's reasoning behind this demand is that Delhi is engulfed by fierce smog because pollution in the humid air has stagnated over Delhi
 hawa nahin chalane yaa barish nahin hone kii vajah se yah pradooshan dilli ke aasmaan se chant nahin paa rahaa he
 He said that if water is washed with a helicopter then all the pollution will dissolve and the air will be cleaned
 mahesh sharma ne kejariwal kii is salaah ko lagbhag darkinar karte hue kaha he ki is tarah ke anokhe suzav dene se pehle dilli sarkaar ko chahie ki pradooshan kam karne ke liye jo aasaan or practical upaay hai un par amal kiya jaae
 For example, increasing the number of buses for public transport, managing traffic and arranging that the cleaning of roads will be done by machines in such a way that dust is not washed away and no garbage is burnt anywhere
 kendriya mantri sharma ne yah bhi kaha kii pradooshan kii vajah se dilli main jo bura haal hua he uski jimmedaari se rajya sarkarein bhi nahin batch sakati kyonki kanoon bananaa centre sarkaar kaa kaam he lekin use lagu karnaa rajya sarkaron kii jimmedaari he
 He said that Kejriwal is pointing fingers at the central government but the Delhi government itself has not taken necessary steps to stop pollution
 haalanki mahesh sharma ne khud hi mana ki dilli main is vaktpradooshan kaa str behad bhayavahaho chukaa he jo sehat ke liye kaaphi khatarnaak he
 It is to be noted that besides being a minister, Mahesh Sharma is also a doctor by profession and he himself said that the level of pollution presently in Delhi can be kept in the category of very dangerous
 mahesh sharma ne bhi yah kaha ki dilli kii yah haalat isliye ho gai he kyonki hawa main nami or pradooshan milakar dilli ke upar thahar gaye hai
 He said that the smoke arising due to burning of stub crops in fields in Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh is also responsible for this situation
 unhone kaha ki is bare main rajya sarkaron se baat kii ja rahi he or centre sarkaar lagaataar sthiti par najar banaae hue hai
 It is also believed that the situation may continue to worsen for the next one or two days
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne tel kii keemten badhane kaa sanket diya he

 While formally inaugurating the $ 4 billion refinery at Bathinda, the Prime Minister said, "about 80 percent of the total oil consumption of crude oil is imported
 aise main antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii oonchi keemton se aayaat kharch par baari dabaav he
 'it is worth noting that the government companies have not increased the prices of domestic LPG and kerosene for the last one year despite the steep increase in the price of crude oil and other essential costs
 pradhanmantri ne kaha, ‘hamen keemton ko tarksangat banane kii jarurat he
 Also it has to be kept in mind that poor and needy people should not be affected by this
 ’haalanki, sarkaar ne june 2010 se petrol keemton ke nirdhaaran par se apana niyantran hataa liya he, lekin sarkari tel companiyaan raajnneetik dabaavon kii vajah se keemton main badhotaree nahin kar paa rahi he

 The Prime Minister said, "to save the common man from the impact of rising oil prices, the government is bearing a heavy burden on diesel, kerosene and domestic LPG prices by keeping them below their actual market cost
 ’vitt varsh 2011-12 ke dauraan indian oil karporation, bharat petroleum or hindustan petroleum ko laagat se kam keemat par dijal, gharelu alpiji or kerosine kii bikri se 1,38,000 karod rupee kaa nuksaan hua

 The Prime Minister said that a total investment of Rs 20,000 crore has been made at the Guru Gobind Singh Refinery with a capacity of 9 million tonnes per annum
 yah saarvajanik or nijee kshetra ke bhagidaari ke lihaaj se ek behatar udhaaharan he
 He said, 'since the beginning of this project in 2004, our government is monitoring the progress being made regularly

 bathinda rifinary main euro-3 or chaar maanak ke eendhan kaa utpaadan kiya jayega
 The Prime Minister said, 'this reflects our commitment to protecting the environment while advancing economic growth
 rifinary ke utpaadon se desh ke uttari hisse main maang or aapurti ke faasale ko paatane main madad milegi
 Describing the progress made in the refinery sector in the country as extraordinary, Manmohan Singh said that India has emerged as a major center in the field of the refinery

 2 million tonnes which was increased to 21 today

 The Prime Minister said, 'we have adequate refinery capacity for the export of petroleum products
 ’ bathinda rifinary shuru hone se bharat ko eendhan niryaat badhaane main madad mil sakati he or pakistan ko niryaat kar saktaa he
 After Pakistan removes the non-tariff barriers on November 2, India can export fuels including petrol and diesel
 bathinda se pakistan main lahore kii duuri kareeb 100 mile he
 The Prime Minister also stressed on fuel savings on this occasion
 unhone kaha ‘hamen apni keemtee urja sansadhano kaa sangrakshan karnaa chaiye
 Petrol, diesel, kerosene or gas, they should be used economically
 upabhoktaaon ko bhi iske prati jaagruk banaaya janaa chaiye

 mohammad ali jinna ko mahaan’ bataae jane kii apni baat par adig jaswant singh ne kaha he ki bijepi se unke nishkasana kii ghatana se yah pataa chal gaya he ki party sankeern maansikta se grasit he
 Expelled from the BJP, what i wrote is my feeling that Jaswant said that the party did not differentiate between Jinnah's personal contribution as a human being and his politics before he was expelled for writing the book 'jinnah: India Partition Independence'
 
 jaswant ne kaha ki maine yah nahin sochaa tha ki party itani zyada sankeern maansikta se grasit he
 So nervous about Jinnah and Patel that i acted on what i wrote
 meri ek bhaavana he jise maine uthaaya bhi shaayad mere purv sahakarmiyon ne jab mujhe sajaa sunai to unhone vastav main kitaab nahin padhi
 The facts of history are mentioned when asked if he has tarnished the image of Vallabhbhai Patel in his book, Jaswant said that i have only mentioned the facts of history
 maine kisi pratik kii chhavi dhoomil nahin kii
 The former BJP leader said he would have liked it if the term expulsion was not used and informed in person

 Many times we feel that the problem of a university is because there is no autonomy, so it should be given autonomy
 jab bhi ucch shiksha kii samasyaon par baat hoti he, autonami yani swaittata ko anti baetic tablet ke rup main pesh kiya jaataa he
 But you look at any university, whether it is private or public, ie whether there is freedom to be autonomous from government or political influence
 sarkaar hi kyon hastkshep karti he, wo hastkshep karnaa band kar de
 Have you ever heard that the process of appointing the Vice Chancellor will be improved, he will not be selected politically
 yah bhi raajnneetik swaittata kaa hi ek rup he jo bhayaavah ho chalaa he
 Krantiguru Shyamji Krishna Varma Professor Girin Bakshi of Chemistry of Kutch University has been blackened
 vishwa guru banane vaale bharat ke guruon kaa ye haal ho rahaa he, aap cheharaa kaala karne vaale chaatro ko dekhie, usee se bharat ke bhavishya kaa andaaza ho jayega
 There are cameras around too, yet fear is not ashamed
 shikshak diwas 5 sitambar ko hota he magar shikshak to koi saal bhar hota hoga
 The students alleged that there was a flaw in the voter letter of the university election
 kya yah itani badi shikaayat he ki ek professor ko is tarah gher kar uskaa munh kaala kar diya jaae
 Vice Chancellor of Kutch University told that Girin Bakshi was teaching in class, from there he was pulled out and his face blackened
 yah swaittata na to ujisi ne di he or na hi kanoon ne magar inhone le lee he to le lee he
 Somewhere in the newspapers they are being written as ABVB activists and elsewhere they are being written as supporters
 ye jo bhi hai bhuj police ne 15-20 chaatro ke khilaaf maamla darj kar liya he
 5 people have been arrested
 yah raajnneetik swaittata kaa namoona he jo kisi bhi swytta se upar hameshaa hi rahegi
 Now we show you a video from Aligarh
 shivdaan singh inter college ke ek dalit adhyaaapak ne akhbaar kii kating fasebuk par post kar di
 The matter reached the police station
 vahaan par bijepi ke padaadhikari kii maujuudagi main unase maafee mangvayi gai, yahi nahin unase paanv chune ke liye majaboor kiya gaya
 First you watch the video and then tell the details further
 kya police thane main bhi insaaf ab is tarah se hoga ki police adhikari kii maujuudagi main ek adhyaaapak ko paanv chhukar maafee maangani hogi
 When the complaint reached the police station, it was to be done according to the law but they were forced to touch the feet and those who have been asked to touch their feet are the BJP President Kalicharan Gaur
 unka is college se koi lenaa dena nahin hai
 Does this autonomy come from political power or is it with the UGC? angrezi padhaane vaale satyabhan singh ne ek akhbaar kii kating post kii jiskaa sheershak he ki yadi bharat ke bhavishya kaa nirmaan karnaa he to brahmanwad ko pairon tale kuchal daalo
 This statement has been told in the newspaper by Swami Vivekananda
 ise share karne kaa aparaadh itnaa bada he ki satyabhan ko dilit karne ke liye majaboor kiya gaya, fasebuk par maafee maangane kii baat kahi gai, usase bhi santushti nahin hui to satyabhan se kaha gaya ki ve pair chhu kar maafee maange
 However, Swami Vivekananda did not say in his speech in Chicago that crush Brahminism under foot
 hamane bhaashan check kiya he
 Was there no caste arrogance in what happened to teacher Satyabhan Singh, who posted a cut of criticism, asked for forgiveness and was asked to touch his feet in the police station
 kisi ko das logon ke bich paanv chune ke liye majaboor karnaa samantvaadi or jativaadee vyavastha nahin he to or kya he
 When the matter had reached the police station, then it would have been left to the law, why was it forced to touch the feet in a casteist and feudal manner
 satyabhan singh se baat karne kii koshish kii magar ve itnaa ghabara gaye hai ki baat hi nahin kii
 a new Act has been uploaded on the website of Ministry of Human Resources today, which shows that the government is going to finish UGC and replace it with a Higher Education Commission
 chaar saal baad achaanak ek nae niamak sanstha kii zarurat kii yaad ai he, yaa isaki zarurat ho bhi sakati he magar bharat kii uniwarsity ayog kaa nahin ab tak thos faislon kaa intazaar kar rahi thi
 The name of what has been uploaded on the Human Resources website is' The Higher Education Commission of India (repeal of UGC Act) Act 2018
 is act par janata se 7 july 2018 tak suzav maanga gaya he
 You have been given only 10 days to give public opinion for such a big change, which you have to email
 sarkaar ne apni manshaa ke bare main likhaa he vah yah act isliye pesh kar rahi he kyonki vah shiksha ke niamak sansthaaon main sudhaar ke liye patibaddh he taaki ucch shiksha sansthaanon ko zyada swaittata mil sake
 The idea of autonomy is whether private and whether government, neither a professor dares to question nor a vice chancellor
 raajnneetik hastkshep is kadar badhata ja rahaa he ki ab mantri tay karte hai ki skool main kya padhaayaa jayega or college main kya padhaayaa jayega
 However, this act is in front of you
 kya inhen sab uddeshyon ke liye ujisi kaa gathan nahin hua tha, nae ucch shiksha ayog ke makasad main aisa kya khaas he jo ujisi main nahin tha yaa ujisi se puraa nahin ho saktaa tha
 Before you believe that India's problems of higher education have become huge, because the UGC needs to be abolished and a new Higher Education Commission should be understood, that the Higher Education Commission will also face the same problems that the UGC will face Are in front
 2014 ke pehle ke kai saal or uske baad ke chaar saal se in samasyaon ke sangrah kaa nateeja yah he ki aaj saare bharat ke noujvaan 12veen paas karne ke baad dilli uniwarsity kii taraf bhaagate hai
 There is a shortage of one lakh teachers in India
 sarkarein ucch shiksha ke saath kis tarah khilwaad karti hai uskaa ek rup aapako dikhaata hum
 The notification you are seeing is from Jharkhand Central University
 25 june ko isaki website par aplod hota he ki jharkhand central uniwarsity asthaayee rup se 64 sahaayak prophessoron ko behaal karnaa chaahati he
 All these will be given a salary of 55000 months in lump sum
 naukari asthaayee hogi
 But within 12 hours of this notification, there is an improvement that now they will get salary of 35000, not 55000
 yah bhi central uniwarsity he
 When we compared the salary of the temporary teachers in Delhi University, the adhoc teachers there get around 65000 salary
 ek hi bharat sarkaar kii ek uniwarsity kisi ko 35000 detii he or kisi ko 65000
 In Madhya Pradesh, teachers in universities and colleges are teaching at a salary of around 20,000
 agar ye mazaaq nahin to phir mazaaq kya he
 Within 12 hours, the salary in advertising decreases from 55 thousand to 35000
 aapako lagata he ki vaaki acchhee quality ke chaatr apana jivan aisi vyavastha ko denge

 In India itself, meritorious students should leave Oxfort and study here to know that Central University of Haryana can run without 75 percent teachers
 aap bhi apane bacchon kaa namakan vahiin karaaen jahaan shikshak nahin hai
 By the way, wherever you do, there will be no teachers, which is the condition
 vaise aapako bataa den ki central uniwarsity bhi swytt sansthaaen maani jaati hai, magar aae din aap vahaan sarkari or raajnneetik hastkshep dekhte rahete hai
 We told you recently that 80 percent of BSC third year students have failed at Ram Manohar Lohia Awadh University
 biessi pratham varsh ke 56 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 It was published in the local media that 80 percent of the students at Awadh University failed
 is hisaab se jab chah lakh chaatro ne pariksha di thi to chaar lakh 80 hazaar hue
 The Vice Chancellor of the University made it a point that when the results of more than three lakh students have come out, then 4 lakh 80 thousand have failed
 ye chook thi magar hamane ye bhi kaha tha ki biessi third year main 80 pratishat fail hue hai
 56 percent failed in the first year
 aaj vaais chancelar manoj dikshit se jab hamaare sahyogi pramod shrivastav ne baat kii to ve nahin bataa sake ki kitne chaatr pariksha main baithe the, fail hone vaale chaatro kii kul sankhya kitni he
 The Vice Chancellor divided the results of the government-aided and self-funded college to show a lower Fail figure
 ve yah bhul gaye ki vaais chancelar sarkari madad praapt collejon ke bhi hai or swavitt poshit collejon ke bhi
 Should such a large number of students fail in the name of alleged copying in a university, is this not a comment on the quality of the university
 vahaan kya padhai hoti he ki nakal rokane par fail ho jate hai
 Today when Pramod spoke to VC Manoj Dixit, he did not tell how many students had taken the exam, while in the press conference around 22 February itself, he said that more than 6 lakh students had taken the exam
 chah lakh chaatr pariksha main baithenge to rigelt chah lakh kaa nikalegaa yaa teen lakh kaa nikalegaa? visi dikshit ne pramod se pehle kaha ki nahin maaloom kitne chaatr pariksha main baithe the, aapako omprakash bataa denge
 Later, Pramod Shrivastava tried to know that it was found that he is not an officer of Om Prakash University, he is not in any position
 kaary parishad ke sadsy hai
 As a matter of fact, the VC should have told in the press release of June 19 when he released after our series and showed the percentage of students failing in government and private colleges, why did not he say that more than 3 lakh students exam Did not come only because anti-copying campaign was going on
 22 farvari ko visi ne kaha tha ki snaatak kii pariksha main 6,11680 chaatr shaamil honge
 Result of 3,41000 students came out and 15-16 percent of it failed
 is hisaab se fail hone vaale chaatro kii sankhya hoti he 54,560
 When VC was asked if more than 6 lakh students gave Imtehan, they said that the remaining students did not come
 is hisaab se 2,70680 chaatr pariksha dene nahin aae, ye to fail se bhi sharmnaak he
 Now add the number of people who failed and did not take the exam
 yah sankhya hoti 3, 25,240 chaatr paas hone laayak nahin hai
 Isn't it embarrassing for a university that half of the students who fill the form either fail to muster the courage to take the exam and fail
 vaise rajyapal ramnike ko check karnaa chahie ki vaaki 2 lakh 7 xxrep 4 0 se adhik chaatro ne pariksha chhod di, or chhod di to yah baat rigelt ke samay kyon nahin website par bataai gai
 Till date it is not mentioned
 19 june kii press relies main visi dikshit bataa sakate the ki kareeb paune teen lakh chaatro ne pariksha hi nahin di
 The comments avadh uniwarsity ke kai collejon main chaatro kii sankhya ke anupaat main shikshak nahin hai
 There are also no teachers according to the number of posts sanctioned
 agar yahi quality shiksha kii rahegi to in uniwarsity ko band kar dena chahie kyonki whants ap uniwarsity to chal hi rahi he
 The results of Kanpur University and Bundelkhand University are also in bad shape
 yaha sirf bie biessi or bikom main 2 lakh 18 hazaar 28 chaatro ne pariksha di thi, isamen se 1 lakh 22 hazaar 583 chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 About 50 percent of the students have failed in Bundelkhand
 sara shrey nakal rokane ko lekar he magar uniwarsity main padhai kii gunvattta kab sudharegi
 Is it good that a university has only 40 percent students
 biessi part van main to 12
 Only 5 percent of the students have passed and the rest have failed
 koi 26000 chaatr fail hai
 Around 24000 students have failed in BSC Part Two
 yah pataa nahin ki biessi main hi 50,000 se adhik chaatr fail hai
 In all courses in Bandelkhand University, 2 lakh 43 thousand students had taken the exam, out of which only 95,445 students have passed
 baaki sab fail
 This is the condition of our higher education
 na teacher hai na principal hai na chaatr paas hone laayak hai
 You can understand what the result will be
 yah bhi raajnneetik swaittata kaa hi ek rup he jo bhayaavah ho chalaa he
 Krantiguru Shyamji Krishna Varma Professor Girin Bakshi of Chemistry of Kutch University has been blackened
 vishwa guru banane vaale bharat ke guruon kaa ye haal ho rahaa he, aap cheharaa kaala karne vaale chaatro ko dekhie, usee se bharat ke bhavishya kaa andaaza ho jayega
 There are cameras around too, yet fear is not ashamed
 shikshak diwas 5 sitambar ko hota he magar shikshak to koi saal bhar hota hoga
 The students alleged that there was a flaw in the voter letter of the university election
 kya yah itani badi shikaayat he ki ek professor ko is tarah gher kar uskaa munh kaala kar diya jaae
 Vice Chancellor of Kutch University told that Girin Bakshi was teaching in class, from there he was pulled out and his face blackened
 yah swaittata na to ujisi ne di he or na hi kanoon ne magar inhone le lee he to le lee he
 Somewhere in the newspapers they are being written as ABVB activists and elsewhere they are being written as supporters
 ye jo bhi hai bhuj police ne 15-20 chaatro ke khilaaf maamla darj kar liya he
 5 people have been arrested
 yah raajnneetik swaittata kaa namoona he jo kisi bhi swytta se upar hameshaa hi rahegi
 Now we show you a video from Aligarh
 shivdaan singh inter college ke ek dalit adhyaaapak ne akhbaar kii kating fasebuk par post kar di
 The matter reached the police station
 vahaan par bijepi ke padaadhikari kii maujuudagi main unase maafee mangvayi gai, yahi nahin unase paanv chune ke liye majaboor kiya gaya
 First you watch the video and then tell the details further
 kya police thane main bhi insaaf ab is tarah se hoga ki police adhikari kii maujuudagi main ek adhyaaapak ko paanv chhukar maafee maangani hogi
 When the complaint reached the police station, it was to be done according to the law but they were forced to touch the feet and those who have been asked to touch their feet are the BJP President Kalicharan Gaur
 unka is college se koi lenaa dena nahin hai
 Does this autonomy come from political power or is it with the UGC? angrezi padhaane vaale satyabhan singh ne ek akhbaar kii kating post kii jiskaa sheershak he ki yadi bharat ke bhavishya kaa nirmaan karnaa he to brahmanwad ko pairon tale kuchal daalo
 This statement has been told in the newspaper by Swami Vivekananda
 ise share karne kaa aparaadh itnaa bada he ki satyabhan ko dilit karne ke liye majaboor kiya gaya, fasebuk par maafee maangane kii baat kahi gai, usase bhi santushti nahin hui to satyabhan se kaha gaya ki ve pair chhu kar maafee maange
 However, Swami Vivekananda did not say in his speech in Chicago that crush Brahminism under foot
 hamane bhaashan check kiya he
 Was there no caste arrogance in what happened to teacher Satyabhan Singh, who posted a cut of criticism, asked for forgiveness and was asked to touch his feet in the police station
 kisi ko das logon ke bich paanv chune ke liye majaboor karnaa samantvaadi or jativaadee vyavastha nahin he to or kya he
 When the matter had reached the police station, then it would have been left to the law, why was it forced to touch the feet in a casteist and feudal manner
 satyabhan singh se baat karne kii koshish kii magar ve itnaa ghabara gaye hai ki baat hi nahin kii
 a new Act has been uploaded on the website of Ministry of Human Resources today, which shows that the government is going to finish UGC and replace it with a Higher Education Commission
 chaar saal baad achaanak ek nae niamak sanstha kii zarurat kii yaad ai he, yaa isaki zarurat ho bhi sakati he magar bharat kii uniwarsity ayog kaa nahin ab tak thos faislon kaa intazaar kar rahi thi
 The name of what has been uploaded on the Human Resources website is' The Higher Education Commission of India (repeal of UGC Act) Act 2018
 is act par janata se 7 july 2018 tak suzav maanga gaya he
 You have been given only 10 days to give public opinion for such a big change, which you have to email
 sarkaar ne apni manshaa ke bare main likhaa he vah yah act isliye pesh kar rahi he kyonki vah shiksha ke niamak sansthaaon main sudhaar ke liye patibaddh he taaki ucch shiksha sansthaanon ko zyada swaittata mil sake
 The idea of autonomy is whether private and whether government, neither a professor dares to question nor a vice chancellor
 raajnneetik hastkshep is kadar badhata ja rahaa he ki ab mantri tay karte hai ki skool main kya padhaayaa jayega or college main kya padhaayaa jayega
 However, this act is in front of you
 kya inhen sab uddeshyon ke liye ujisi kaa gathan nahin hua tha, nae ucch shiksha ayog ke makasad main aisa kya khaas he jo ujisi main nahin tha yaa ujisi se puraa nahin ho saktaa tha
 Before you believe that India's problems of higher education have become huge, because the UGC needs to be abolished and a new Higher Education Commission should be understood, that the Higher Education Commission will also face the same problems that the UGC will face Are in front
 2014 ke pehle ke kai saal or uske baad ke chaar saal se in samasyaon ke sangrah kaa nateeja yah he ki aaj saare bharat ke noujvaan 12veen paas karne ke baad dilli uniwarsity kii taraf bhaagate hai
 There is a shortage of one lakh teachers in India
 sarkarein ucch shiksha ke saath kis tarah khilwaad karti hai uskaa ek rup aapako dikhaata hum
 The notification you are seeing is from Jharkhand Central University
 25 june ko isaki website par aplod hota he ki jharkhand central uniwarsity asthaayee rup se 64 sahaayak prophessoron ko behaal karnaa chaahati he
 All these will be given a salary of 55000 months in lump sum
 naukari asthaayee hogi
 But within 12 hours of this notification, there is an improvement that now they will get salary of 35000, not 55000
 yah bhi central uniwarsity he
 When we compared the salary of the temporary teachers in Delhi University, the adhoc teachers there get around 65000 salary
 ek hi bharat sarkaar kii ek uniwarsity kisi ko 35000 detii he or kisi ko 65000
 In Madhya Pradesh, teachers in universities and colleges are teaching at a salary of around 20,000
 agar ye mazaaq nahin to phir mazaaq kya he
 Within 12 hours, the salary in advertising decreases from 55 thousand to 35000
 aapako lagata he ki vaaki acchhee quality ke chaatr apana jivan aisi vyavastha ko denge
 Will give in compulsion but will he have his first election? On 20 August 2017, there is a report of Manas in the Times of India
 jisamen maanav sansaadhan mantri kaa bayaan chapa he ki iaiti, enaiti or universti main ek tihaai pad khaali hai
 So 53 at New Central University
 28 pratishat pad khaali hai
 National Institute of Technology has 47 percent vacancies
 nae or puraani iaiti main 35 pratishat pad khaali hai
 At IIM too, 26 percent of the posts are vacant
 im indore main to 51 pratishat pad khaali hai
 The Times of India report states that the government has given all this information to the Parliament
 aapako pataa hi hoga ki saaton ames main teaching ke 70 fisadi se adhik pad khaali hai
 i am making a list of teaching staff of other medical colleges, the situation is also bad there
 bina teacher ke aap padhakar doctor ho jaae yah kamaal kahaan ho saktaa he, yah baar-baar bataane kii zarurat nahin he
 This is the report for August 2017
 is vakt kitne pad bhare ja chuke hai maanav sansaadhan mantri hi behatar bataa sakate he
 In the morning, one can tweet that till last year, more than 6000 posts were vacant in Central University, how many of them have got permanent appointment
 permanent kii baat kar rahaa hum
 On 20 March 2017, Human Resource Minister Prakash Javadekar had said that 9000 adhoc teachers of Delhi University were permanent within a year
 ek saal se zyaada hone ja rahaa he
 Reminding the Minister that i can also tweet tomorrow about how many of the 9000 have admanked
 hamen to pataa he behatar he vahiin bataa den
 According to 'times of India', as of April 1, 2017, Central University Haryana has 75 percent vacancies
 dilli uniwarsity main 54
 75 percent posts are vacant
 elahabaad uniwarsity main 64 fisadi pad khaali hai
 In India itself, meritorious students should leave Oxfort and study here to know that Central University of Haryana can run without 75 percent teachers
 aap bhi apane bacchon kaa namakan vahiin karaaen jahaan shikshak nahin hai
 By the way, wherever you do, there will be no teachers, which is the condition

 na teacher hai na principal hai na chaatr paas hone laayak hai
 You can understand what the result will be
 kuccha uniwarsity ke vaais chancelar ne bataaya ki girin bakshi class main padhaa rahe the, vahaan se inhen khinch kar baahar nikaala gaya or cheharaa kaala kar diya gaya
 Neither the UGC nor the law has given this autonomy, but they have taken it
 akhabaaron main kahin inhen abivibi kaa kaaryakarta likhaa ja rahaa he to kahin samarthak likhaa ja rahaa he
 Whatever these are, Bhuj police have registered a case against 15-20 students
 5 log giraftaar kiye gaye hai
 It is a model of political autonomy that will always be above any autonomy
 ab ham aapako aligarh se ek video dikhaate hai
 a Dalit teacher from Shivdan Singh Inter College posted the newspaper's cutting on Facebook
 maamla thana pahunch gaya
 In the presence of the BJP official there, he was asked for forgiveness, not only that he was forced to touch his feet
 pehle aap video dekhie phir aage detail bataate hai
 Will justice be done in the police station also in such a way that in the presence of a police officer, a teacher will have to apologize after touching his feet
 jab thane tak shikaayat pahunch gai tab kanoon ke hisaab se hona tha magar paanv chune ke liye majaboor kiya gaya or jinka paanv chune ke liye kaha gaya he wo bhaajapa ke mandal adhyaksh kaalicharan goud hai
 They have nothing to do with this college
 yah swaittata raajnneetik satta se aati he yaa ujisi se mili hui he? Satyabhan Singh, who teaches English, posted the cutting of a newspaper titled, "if we want to build the future of India, then crush Brahminism under the feet
" akhbaar main yah kathan swami vivekanand kaa bataaya gaya he
 The crime of sharing it is so great that Satyabhan was forced to delete, Facebook was asked to apologize, even if he was not satisfied, Satyabhan was told to apologize by touching his feet
 vaise swami vivekanand ne chicago ke apane bhaashan main aisa nahin kaha tha ki brahmanwad ko pairon tale kuchal daalo
 We have checked the speech
 kya adhyaaapak satyabhan singh ke saath jo hua usamen jati kaa ahankaar nahin tha ki aalochana kii ek kating kya post kar di unase maafee mangvayi gai or thane main paanv chune ke liye kaha gaya
 Forcing someone to touch their feet among ten people is not a feudalistic and casteist system
 jab thane tak maamla pahunch hi gaya tha to phir kanoon par chhod diya jaataa, vahaan jatigat or saamanti tareeke se paanv chune ke liye kyon majaboor kiya gaya
 Tried to talk to Satyabhan Singh but he is so nervous that he did not talk
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay kii website par aaj ek nayaa act aplod kiya he, jisase pataa chalata he ki sarkaar ujisi khatm kar uski jagah ucch shiksha ayog banane ja rahi he
 Four years later, the need for a new regulatory body is suddenly missed, or it may be needed, but the University Commission of India was not yet waiting for concrete decisions
 maanav sansaadhan kii website par jo aplod hua he uskaa naam he 'the Higher Education Commission Of India (repeal Of UGC Act) Act 2018
 Suggestions have been sought from the public on 7 July 2018 on this act
 itane bade badlaav ke liye janata ko raay dene ke liye sirf 10 din die gaye hai, jise aapako email karnaa he
 The government has written about its intention that it is introducing this act because it is committed to reform the regulatory bodies of education so that higher education institutions can get more autonomy
 swaittata kaa alam ye he ki kya privet or kya sarkari, na to kisi professor ko sawaal karne kii himmat hoti he na kisi vaais chancelar ko
 Political interference is increasing so much that now the ministers decide what will be taught in school and what will be taught in college
 baharhaal yah act aapke saamne he
 Was the UGC not formed for all these purposes, what is special about the purpose of the new Higher Education Commission which was not in the UGC or could not be completed by the UGC
 isse pehle ki aap yakeen kar len ki bharat kii ucch shiksha kii samasyaayein isliye vikaraal ho chuki hai, kyonki ujisi ko samaapt kar nayaa ucch shiksha ayog banane kii zarurat he, yah samajhnaa chahie ki ucch shiksha ayog ke saamne bhi vahi samasyaayein hongi jo ujisi ke saamne hai
 Many years before 2014 and four years after that, the result of the collection of these problems is that today, youths from all over India rush to Delhi University after passing 12th
 bharat main ek lakh shikshakon kii kami he
 Let me show you a form of how governments play with higher education
 ye jo notification aap dekh rahe hai wo jharkhand central uniwarsity kaa he
 On 25 June, it is uploaded on its website that Jharkhand Central University wants to temporarily reinstate 64 assistant professors
 in sabhi ko ekamusth 55000 maheene kii selary di jaaegi
 The job will be temporary
 magar is notification ke 12 ghante ke bheetar ek sudhaar karti he ki ab unhen 55000 nahin, 35000 kii selary milegi
 It is also Central University
 hamane dilli uniwarsity main asthaayee padhaane vaale shikshakon kii selary se tulana kii to vahaan edock padhaane waalon ko 65000 ke kareeb selary milti he
 a university of the same Government of India gives 35000 to someone and 65000 to someone
 madhya pradesh main to uniwarsity or colejo main shikshak 20,000 ke aas paas kii selary par padhaa rahe hai
 If this is not a joke, then what is a joke? 12 ghante ke bheetar vigyaapan main selary 55 hazaar se ghatakar 35000 ho jaati he
 You feel that students of really good quality will give their lives to such a system
 majaburi main de denge lekin kya unka pehla chunaav hoga? 20 agast 2017 ko 'times of india main maanas kii ek report he
 In which the statement of the Minister of Human Resources has been printed that one third of the posts in iits, nits and Universities are vacant
 nai central uniwarsity main to 53
 28 percent of the posts are vacant
 neshnal institute of technolji main 47 pratishat pad khaali hai
 There are 35 percent vacancies in the new and old iits
 im main bhi 26 pratishat pad khaali hai
 At IIM Indore, 51 percent posts are vacant
 'times of india' kii report main likhaa he ki sarkaar ne sansad ko yah sab jaankaree di he
 You will be aware that more than 70 percent teaching positions are vacant in all the seven AIIMS
 baaki medical collejon ke teaching staff kii list bana rahaa hum, vahaan bhi haalat buree he
 Without a teacher, if you study and become a doctor, there is no need to tell again where this can be amazing
 agast 2017 kii yah report he
 How many posts have been filled at this time, only the HR Minister can tell better
 subah-subah twit kar sakate hai ki central uniwarsity main jo pichley saal tak 6000 se adhik pad khaali the, unamem se kitne par sthaayee niyukti ho chuki he
 i am talking about permanent 20 march 2017 ko maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jawadekar ne kaha tha ki ek saal ke bheetar dilli uniwarsity ke 9000 edock shikshakon ko permanent kar diya gaya
 Is going to be more than a year
 mantriji ko yaad dilaa rahaa hum ki is bare main bhi kal twit kar sakate hai ki 9000 main se kitne edock ko permanent kar chuke hai
 We know it is better to tell right there
 vaise 'times of india' ke mutabik ek april 2017 tak central uniwarsity haryana main 75 fisadi khaali hai
 54 in Delhi University
 75 pratishat pad khaali hai
 Allahabad University has 64 percent vacancies
 bharat main hi 75 pratishat shikshakon ke bina central uniwarsity of haryana chal sakati he yahi jaanane ke liye medhaavi chaatro ko oxfort chhodkar yahaan padhane aana chahie
 You should also enroll your children where there are no teachers
 vaise jahaan bhi karaayenge vahaan shikshak nahin hi honge jo haal he
 By the way, let us tell you that Central University is also considered as autonomous institutions, but every day you see government and political interference there
 hamane aapako pichley dinon bataaya tha ki raamamanohar lohia avadh uniwarsity main biessi third year ke 80 pratishath chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 56 percent of b
sc first year students have failed
 sthaneey media main chapa tha ki avadh uniwarsity main 80 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye
 According to this, when six lakh students took the exam, then there were four lakh 80 thousand
 vishvavidhyalay ke vaais chancelar ne ise hi mudda bana liya ki jab teen lakh se kuch zyada chaatro ke riselt hi nikle hai to 4 lakh 80 hazaar fail ho gaye
 This was a mistake, but we also said that 80 percent of the BSC third year have failed
 first year main 56 pratishat fail hue hai
 Today when our colleague Pramod Srivastava spoke to Vice Chancellor Manoj Dixit, he could not tell how many students appeared in the exam, the total number of students who failed
 vaais chancelar ne fail ke aankade kam dikhaane ke liye sarkari madad praapt or swavitt poshit college ke nateezon main bantwaaraa kar diya
 They have forgotten that the Vice Chancellors are from government aided colleges as well as self-funded colleges
 ek uniwarsity main kathith rup se nakal rokane ke naam par itani badi sankhya main chaatr fail ho jaae kya yah vishwa vidhyalay kii gunvattta par tippanee nahin he
 What is studied there that fails to stop copying? aaj jab pramod ne visi manoj dikshit se baat kii tab unhone nahin bataaya ki kitne chaatro ne pariksha di thi jabaki 22 farvari ke aas paas press conference main khud kaha tha ki 6 lakh se adhik chaatro ne pariksha di thi
 If six lakh students sit for the exam, will the result be six lakhs or three lakhs? VC Dixit said before Pramod that he did not know how many students sat in the examination, Omprakash will tell you
 baad main pramod shrivastav ne jaanane kii koshish ki to yah pataa chalaa ki ye om prakaash uniwarsity ke koi adhikari nahi hai, kisi pad par nahin hai
 Member of Council for Work
 kaayade se visi ko 19 june ke press relies main hi bataanaa chahie tha jab unhone hamaari siries ke baad jari kiya tha or jisamen sarkari or privet collejon main fail hone vaale chaatro kaa pratishat dikhaaya tha, usamen kyon nahin kaha ki 3 lakh se adhik chaatr pariksha hi nahin dene aae kyonki nakal virdohi abhiyaan chal rahaa tha
 On 22 February, VC said that 6,11680 students would be included in the graduation exam
 3,41000 chaatro kaa rigelt niklaa or isamen se 15-16 pratishat fail ho gaye
 Accordingly, the number of students failing is 54,560
 jab visi se poocha gaya ki imtehaan to 6 lakh se adhik chaatro ne diya to unhone kaha ki baaki chaatr nahin aae
 Accordingly, 2,70680 students did not come to take the exam, it is shameful even to fail
 ab aap fail hone vaale or pariksha nahin dene waalon kii sankhya jodie
 This number is 3, 25,240 students are not eligible to pass
 kya yah kisi uniwarsity ke liye sharmnaak nahin he ki form bharne vaale chaatro main se aadhe yaa to imtahaan dene kaa saahas na juta saken or fail ho jaaen
 By the way, Governor Ramnaik should check that indeed more than 2 lakh 7 xxrep 4 0 students left the examination, and left, then why was it not stated on the website at the time of the result
 aaj tak iskaa zikr nahin he
 In the press release of June 19, VC Dixit could tell that about one-third of the three lakh students did not take the exam
 tippaniyan Many colleges in Avadh University do not have teachers in proportion to the number of students
 manzur padon kii sankhya ke hisaab se bhi shikshak nahin hai
 If this quality education remains, then these universities should be closed because what is app university is going on
 kanpur uniwarsity or bundelkhand uniwarsity ke nateezon kaa bhi bura haal he
 Only 2 lakh 18 thousand 28 students took the exam in BA b
sc and b
com here, out of which 1 lakh 22 thousand 583 students have failed
 kareeb kareeb 50 fisadi chaatr bundelkhand main fail hai
 All the credit is about stopping copying, but when will the quality of studies in the university improve
 kya yah acchhee baat he ki ek uniwarsity main sirf 40 pratishat chaatr paas hon
 So 12 in BSC Part One
 5 pratishat chaatr hi paas hue hai baaki sab fail hai
 Some 26000 students have failed
 biessi part tu main bhi 24000 ke kareeb chaatr fail hai
 It is not known that more than 50,000 students have failed in BSC itself
 bandelkhand uniwarsity main sabhi course main kul milakar 2 lakh 43 hazaar chaatro ne pariksha di thi, jisamen se 95,445 chaatr hi paas hue he
 Everyone else failed
 ye he hamaari ucch shiksha kaa haal
 There are neither teachers nor principals nor students are eligible to pass
 nateeja kya hoga aap samaj sakate hai
 It is a model of political autonomy that will always be above any autonomy
 ab ham aapako aligarh se ek video dikhaate hai
 a Dalit teacher from Shivdan Singh Inter College posted the newspaper's cutting on Facebook
 maamla thana pahunch gaya
 In the presence of the BJP official there, he was asked for forgiveness, not only that he was forced to touch his feet
 pehle aap video dekhie phir aage detail bataate hai
 Will justice be done in the police station also in such a way that in the presence of a police officer, a teacher will have to apologize after touching his feet
 jab thane tak shikaayat pahunch gai tab kanoon ke hisaab se hona tha magar paanv chune ke liye majaboor kiya gaya or jinka paanv chune ke liye kaha gaya he wo bhaajapa ke mandal adhyaksh kaalicharan goud hai
 They have nothing to do with this college
 yah swaittata raajnneetik satta se aati he yaa ujisi se mili hui he? Satyabhan Singh, who teaches English, posted the cutting of a newspaper titled, "if we want to build the future of India, then crush Brahminism under the feet
" akhbaar main yah kathan swami vivekanand kaa bataaya gaya he
 The crime of sharing it is so great that Satyabhan was forced to delete, Facebook was asked to apologize, even if he was not satisfied, Satyabhan was told to apologize by touching his feet
 vaise swami vivekanand ne chicago ke apane bhaashan main aisa nahin kaha tha ki brahmanwad ko pairon tale kuchal daalo
 We have checked the speech
 kya adhyaaapak satyabhan singh ke saath jo hua usamen jati kaa ahankaar nahin tha ki aalochana kii ek kating kya post kar di unase maafee mangvayi gai or thane main paanv chune ke liye kaha gaya
 Forcing someone to touch their feet among ten people is not a feudalistic and casteist system
 jab thane tak maamla pahunch hi gaya tha to phir kanoon par chhod diya jaataa, vahaan jatigat or saamanti tareeke se paanv chune ke liye kyon majaboor kiya gaya

 The government has written about its intention that it is introducing this act because it is committed to reform the regulatory bodies of education so that higher education institutions can get more autonomy
 swaittata kaa alam ye he ki kya privet or kya sarkari, na to kisi professor ko sawaal karne kii himmat hoti he na kisi vaais chancelar ko
 Political interference is increasing so much that now the ministers decide what will be taught in school and what will be taught in college
 baharhaal yah act aapke saamne he

 Many years before 2014 and four years after that, the result of the collection of these problems is that today, youths from all over India rush to Delhi University after passing 12th

 madhya pradesh main to uniwarsity or colejo main shikshak 20,000 ke aas paas kii selary par padhaa rahe hai
 If this is not a joke, then what is a joke? 12 ghante ke bheetar vigyaapan main selary 55 hazaar se ghatakar 35000 ho jaati he
 You feel that students of really good quality will give their lives to such a system
 majaburi main de denge lekin kya unka pehla chunaav hoga? 20 agast 2017 ko 'times of india main maanas kii ek report he

 You should also enroll your children where there are no teachers

 This was a mistake, but we also said that 80 percent of the BSC third year have failed
 first year main 56 pratishat fail hue hai
 Today when our colleague Pramod Srivastava spoke to Vice Chancellor Manoj Dixit, he could not tell how many students appeared in the exam, the total number of students who failed
 vaais chancelar ne fail ke aankade kam dikhaane ke liye sarkari madad praapt or swavitt poshit college ke nateezon main bantwaaraa kar diya

 Many years before 2014 and four years after that, the result of the collection of these problems is that today, youths from all over India rush to Delhi University after passing 12th
 bharat main ek lakh shikshakon kii kami he
 Let me show you a form of how governments play with higher education
 ye jo notification aap dekh rahe hai wo jharkhand central uniwarsity kaa he
 On 25 June, it is uploaded on its website that Jharkhand Central University wants to temporarily reinstate 64 assistant professors
 in sabhi ko ekamusth 55000 maheene kii selary di jaaegi
 The job will be temporary
 magar is notification ke 12 ghante ke bheetar ek sudhaar karti he ki ab unhen 55000 nahin, 35000 kii selary milegi
 It is also Central University

 a university of the same Government of India gives 35000 to someone and 65000 to someone
 madhya pradesh main to uniwarsity or colejo main shikshak 20,000 ke aas paas kii selary par padhaa rahe hai
 If this is not a joke, then what is a joke? 12 ghante ke bheetar vigyaapan main selary 55 hazaar se ghatakar 35000 ho jaati he
 You feel that students of really good quality will give their lives to such a system
 majaburi main de denge lekin kya unka pehla chunaav hoga? 20 agast 2017 ko 'times of india main maanas kii ek report he
 In which the statement of the Minister of Human Resources has been printed that one third of the posts in iits, nits and Universities are vacant

 28 percent of the posts are vacant
 neshnal institute of technolji main 47 pratishat pad khaali hai
 There are 35 percent vacancies in the new and old iits
 im main bhi 26 pratishat pad khaali hai
 At IIM Indore, 51 percent posts are vacant
 the report of 'times of India' that the government has given all this information to the Parliament
 aapako pataa hi hoga ki saaton ames main teaching ke 70 fisadi se adhik pad khaali hai
 i am making a list of teaching staff of other medical colleges, the situation is also bad there
 bina teacher ke aap padhakar doctor ho jaae yah kamaal kahaan ho saktaa he, yah baar-baar bataane kii zarurat nahin he
 This is the report for August 2017
 is vakt kitne pad bhare ja chuke hai maanav sansaadhan mantri hi behatar bataa sakate he
 In the morning, one can tweet that till last year, more than 6000 posts were vacant in Central University, how many of them have got permanent appointment
 permanent kii baat kar rahaa hum
 On 20 March 2017, Human Resource Minister Prakash Javadekar had said that 9000 adhoc teachers of Delhi University were permanent within a year
 ek saal se zyaada hone ja rahaa he
 Reminding the Minister that i can also tweet tomorrow about how many of the 9000 have admanked
 hamen to pataa he behatar he vahiin bataa den
 According to 'times of India', as of April 1, 2017, Central University Haryana has 75 percent vacancies
 dilli uniwarsity main 54
 75 percent posts are vacant
 elahabaad uniwarsity main 64 fisadi pad khaali hai
 In India itself, meritorious students should leave Oxfort and study here to know that Central University of Haryana can run without 75 percent teachers
 aap bhi apane bacchon kaa namakan vahiin karaaen jahaan shikshak nahin hai
 By the way, wherever you do, there will be no teachers, which is the condition
 vaise aapako bataa den ki central uniwarsity bhi swytt sansthaaen maani jaati hai, magar aae din aap vahaan sarkari or raajnneetik hastkshep dekhte rahete hai
 We told you recently that 80 percent of BSC third year students have failed at Ram Manohar Lohia Awadh University
 biessi pratham varsh ke 56 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 It was published in the local media that 80 percent of the students at Awadh University failed
 is hisaab se jab chah lakh chaatro ne pariksha di thi to chaar lakh 80 hazaar hue
 The Vice Chancellor of the University made it a point that when the results of more than three lakh students have come out, then 4 lakh 80 thousand have failed
 ye chook thi magar hamane ye bhi kaha tha ki biessi third year main 80 pratishat fail hue hai
 56 percent failed in the first year
 aaj vaais chancelar manoj dikshit se jab hamaare sahyogi pramod shrivastav ne baat kii to ve nahin bataa sake ki kitne chaatr pariksha main baithe the, fail hone vaale chaatro kii kul sankhya kitni he
 The Vice Chancellor divided the results of the government-aided and self-funded college to show a lower Fail figure
 ve yah bhul gaye ki vaais chancelar sarkari madad praapt collejon ke bhi hai or swavitt poshit collejon ke bhi
 Should such a large number of students fail in the name of alleged copying in a university, is this not a comment on the quality of the university
 vahaan kya padhai hoti he ki nakal rokane par fail ho jate hai
 Today when Pramod spoke to VC Manoj Dixit, he did not tell how many students had taken the exam, while in the press conference around 22 February itself, he said that more than 6 lakh students had taken the exam
 chah lakh chaatr pariksha main baithenge to rigelt chah lakh kaa nikalegaa yaa teen lakh kaa nikalegaa? visi dikshit ne pramod se pehle kaha ki nahin maaloom kitne chaatr pariksha main baithe the, aapako omprakash bataa denge
 Later, Pramod Shrivastava tried to know that it was found that he is not an officer of Om Prakash University, he is not in any position
 kaary parishad ke sadsy hai
 As a matter of fact, the VC should have told in the press release of June 19 when he released after our series and showed the percentage of students failing in government and private colleges, why did not he say that more than 3 lakh students exam Did not come only because anti-copying campaign was going on
 22 farvari ko visi ne kaha tha ki snaatak kii pariksha main 6,11680 chaatr shaamil honge
 Result of 3,41000 students came out and 15-16 percent of it failed
 is hisaab se fail hone vaale chaatro kii sankhya hoti he 54,560
 When VC was asked if more than 6 lakh students gave Imtehan, they said that the remaining students did not come
 is hisaab se 2,70680 chaatr pariksha dene nahin aae, ye to fail se bhi sharmnaak he
 Now add the number of people who failed and did not take the exam
 yah sankhya hoti 3, 25,240 chaatr paas hone laayak nahin hai
 Isn't it embarrassing for a university that half of the students who fill the form either fail to muster the courage to take the exam and fail
 vaise rajyapal ramnike ko check karnaa chahie ki vaaki 2 lakh 7 xxrep 4 0 se adhik chaatro ne pariksha chhod di, or chhod di to yah baat rigelt ke samay kyon nahin website par bataai gai
 Till date it is not mentioned
 19 june kii press relies main visi dikshit bataa sakate the ki kareeb paune teen lakh chaatro ne pariksha hi nahin di
 The comments avadh uniwarsity ke kai collejon main chaatro kii sankhya ke anupaat main shikshak nahin hai
 There are also no teachers according to the number of posts sanctioned
 agar yahi quality shiksha kii rahegi to in uniwarsity ko band kar dena chahie kyonki whants ap uniwarsity to chal hi rahi he
 The results of Kanpur University and Bundelkhand University are also in bad shape
 yaha sirf bie biessi or bikom main 2 lakh 18 hazaar 28 chaatro ne pariksha di thi, isamen se 1 lakh 22 hazaar 583 chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 About 50 percent of the students have failed in Bundelkhand
 sara shrey nakal rokane ko lekar he magar uniwarsity main padhai kii gunvattta kab sudharegi
 Is it good that a university has only 40 percent students
 biessi part van main to 12
 Only 5 percent of the students have passed and the rest have failed
 koi 26000 chaatr fail hai
 Around 24000 students have failed in BSC Part Two
 yah pataa nahin ki biessi main hi 50,000 se adhik chaatr fail hai
 In all courses in Bandelkhand University, 2 lakh 43 thousand students had taken the exam, out of which only 95,445 students have passed
 baaki sab fail
 This is the condition of our higher education
 na teacher hai na principal hai na chaatr paas hone laayak hai
 You can understand what the result will be
 kya adhyaaapak satyabhan singh ke saath jo hua usamen jati kaa ahankaar nahin tha ki aalochana kii ek kating kya post kar di unase maafee mangvayi gai or thane main paanv chune ke liye kaha gaya
 Forcing someone to touch their feet among ten people is not a feudalistic and casteist system
 jab thane tak maamla pahunch hi gaya tha to phir kanoon par chhod diya jaataa, vahaan jatigat or saamanti tareeke se paanv chune ke liye kyon majaboor kiya gaya
 Tried to talk to Satyabhan Singh but he is so nervous that he did not talk
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay kii website par aaj ek nayaa act aplod kiya he, jisase pataa chalata he ki sarkaar ujisi khatm kar uski jagah ucch shiksha ayog banane ja rahi he
 Four years later, the need for a new regulatory body is suddenly missed, or it may be needed, but the University Commission of India was not yet waiting for concrete decisions
 maanav sansaadhan kii website par jo aplod hua he uskaa naam he 'the Higher Education Commission Of India (repeal Of UGC Act) Act 2018
 Suggestions have been sought from the public on 7 July 2018 on this act
 itane bade badlaav ke liye janata ko raay dene ke liye sirf 10 din die gaye hai, jise aapako email karnaa he
 The government has written about its intention that it is introducing this act because it is committed to reform the regulatory bodies of education so that higher education institutions can get more autonomy
 swaittata kaa alam ye he ki kya privet or kya sarkari, na to kisi professor ko sawaal karne kii himmat hoti he na kisi vaais chancelar ko
 Political interference is increasing so much that now the ministers decide what will be taught in school and what will be taught in college
 baharhaal yah act aapke saamne he
 Was the UGC not formed for all these purposes, what is special about the purpose of the new Higher Education Commission which was not in the UGC or could not be completed by the UGC

 How many posts have been filled at this time, only the HR Minister can tell better
 subah-subah twit kar sakate hai ki central uniwarsity main jo pichley saal tak 6000 se adhik pad khaali the, unamem se kitne par sthaayee niyukti ho chuki he

 vaise 'times of india' ke mutabik ek april 2017 tak central uniwarsity haryana main 75 fisadi khaali hai
 54 in Delhi University
 75 pratishat pad khaali hai
 Allahabad University has 64 percent vacancies
 bharat main hi 75 pratishat shikshakon ke bina central uniwarsity of haryana chal sakati he yahi jaanane ke liye medhaavi chaatro ko oxfort chhodkar yahaan padhane aana chahie
 You should also enroll your children where there are no teachers
 vaise jahaan bhi karaayenge vahaan shikshak nahin hi honge jo haal he
 By the way, let us tell you that Central University is also considered as autonomous institutions, but every day you see government and political interference there
 hamane aapako pichley dinon bataaya tha ki raamamanohar lohia avadh uniwarsity main biessi third year ke 80 pratishath chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 56 percent of b
sc first year students have failed
 sthaneey media main chapa tha ki avadh uniwarsity main 80 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye
 According to this, when six lakh students took the exam, then there were four lakh 80 thousand
 vishvavidhyalay ke vaais chancelar ne ise hi mudda bana liya ki jab teen lakh se kuch zyada chaatro ke riselt hi nikle hai to 4 lakh 80 hazaar fail ho gaye
 This was a mistake, but we also said that 80 percent of the BSC third year have failed
 first year main 56 pratishat fail hue hai
 Today when our colleague Pramod Srivastava spoke to Vice Chancellor Manoj Dixit, he could not tell how many students appeared in the exam, the total number of students who failed
 vaais chancelar ne fail ke aankade kam dikhaane ke liye sarkari madad praapt or swavitt poshit college ke nateezon main bantwaaraa kar diya
 They have forgotten that the Vice Chancellors are from government aided colleges as well as self-funded colleges
 ek uniwarsity main kathith rup se nakal rokane ke naam par itani badi sankhya main chaatr fail ho jaae kya yah vishwa vidhyalay kii gunvattta par tippanee nahin he
 What is studied there that fails to stop copying? aaj jab pramod ne visi manoj dikshit se baat kii tab unhone nahin bataaya ki kitne chaatro ne pariksha di thi jabaki 22 farvari ke aas paas press conference main khud kaha tha ki 6 lakh se adhik chaatro ne pariksha di thi
 If six lakh students sit for the exam, will the result be six lakhs or three lakhs? VC Dixit said before Pramod that he did not know how many students sat in the examination, Omprakash will tell you
 baad main pramod shrivastav ne jaanane kii koshish ki to yah pataa chalaa ki ye om prakaash uniwarsity ke koi adhikari nahi hai, kisi pad par nahin hai

 kaayade se visi ko 19 june ke press relies main hi bataanaa chahie tha jab unhone hamaari siries ke baad jari kiya tha or jisamen sarkari or privet collejon main fail hone vaale chaatro kaa pratishat dikhaaya tha, usamen kyon nahin kaha ki 3 lakh se adhik chaatr pariksha hi nahin dene aae kyonki nakal virdohi abhiyaan chal rahaa tha
 On 22 February, VC said that 6,11680 students would be included in the graduation exam
 3,41000 chaatro kaa rigelt niklaa or isamen se 15-16 pratishat fail ho gaye
 Accordingly, the number of students failing is 54,560
 jab visi se poocha gaya ki imtehaan to 6 lakh se adhik chaatro ne diya to unhone kaha ki baaki chaatr nahin aae
 Accordingly, 2,70680 students did not come to take the exam, it is shameful even to fail
 ab aap fail hone vaale or pariksha nahin dene waalon kii sankhya jodie
 This number is 3, 25,240 students are not eligible to pass
 kya yah kisi uniwarsity ke liye sharmnaak nahin he ki form bharne vaale chaatro main se aadhe yaa to imtahaan dene kaa saahas na juta saken or fail ho jaaen
 By the way, Governor Ramnaik should check that indeed more than 2 lakh 7 xxrep 4 0 students left the examination, and left, then why was it not stated on the website at the time of the result
 aaj tak iskaa zikr nahin he
 In the press release of June 19, VC Dixit could tell that about one-third of the three lakh students did not take the exam
 tippaniyan Many colleges in Avadh University do not have teachers in proportion to the number of students
 manzur padon kii sankhya ke hisaab se bhi shikshak nahin hai
 If this quality education remains, then these universities should be closed because what is app university is going on
 kanpur uniwarsity or bundelkhand uniwarsity ke nateezon kaa bhi bura haal he
 Only 2 lakh 18 thousand 28 students took the exam in BA b
sc and b
com here, out of which 1 lakh 22 thousand 583 students have failed
 kareeb kareeb 50 fisadi chaatr bundelkhand main fail hai
 All the credit is about stopping copying, but when will the quality of studies in the university improve
 kya yah acchhee baat he ki ek uniwarsity main sirf 40 pratishat chaatr paas hon
 So 12 in BSC Part One
 5 pratishat chaatr hi paas hue hai baaki sab fail hai
 Some 26000 students have failed
 biessi part tu main bhi 24000 ke kareeb chaatr fail hai
 It is not known that more than 50,000 students have failed in BSC itself
 bandelkhand uniwarsity main sabhi course main kul milakar 2 lakh 43 hazaar chaatro ne pariksha di thi, jisamen se 95,445 chaatr hi paas hue he
 Everyone else failed
 ye he hamaari ucch shiksha kaa haal

 kanpur uniwarsity or bundelkhand uniwarsity ke nateezon kaa bhi bura haal he
 Only 2 lakh 18 thousand 28 students took the exam in BA b
sc and b
com here, out of which 1 lakh 22 thousand 583 students have failed
 kareeb kareeb 50 fisadi chaatr bundelkhand main fail hai
 All the credit is about stopping copying, but when will the quality of studies in the university improve
 kya yah acchhee baat he ki ek uniwarsity main sirf 40 pratishat chaatr paas hon
 So 12 in BSC Part One
 5 pratishat chaatr hi paas hue hai baaki sab fail hai
 Some 26000 students have failed
 biessi part tu main bhi 24000 ke kareeb chaatr fail hai
 It is not known that more than 50,000 students have failed in BSC itself
 bandelkhand uniwarsity main sabhi course main kul milakar 2 lakh 43 hazaar chaatro ne pariksha di thi, jisamen se 95,445 chaatr hi paas hue he
 Everyone else failed
 ye he hamaari ucch shiksha kaa haal
 There are neither teachers nor principals nor students are eligible to pass
 nateeja kya hoga aap samaj sakate hai
 The government has written about its intention that it is introducing this act because it is committed to reform the regulatory bodies of education so that higher education institutions can get more autonomy
 swaittata kaa alam ye he ki kya privet or kya sarkari, na to kisi professor ko sawaal karne kii himmat hoti he na kisi vaais chancelar ko
 Political interference is increasing so much that now the ministers decide what will be taught in school and what will be taught in college
 baharhaal yah act aapke saamne he
 Was the UGC not formed for all these purposes, what is special about the purpose of the new Higher Education Commission which was not in the UGC or could not be completed by the UGC
 isse pehle ki aap yakeen kar len ki bharat kii ucch shiksha kii samasyaayein isliye vikaraal ho chuki hai, kyonki ujisi ko samaapt kar nayaa ucch shiksha ayog banane kii zarurat he, yah samajhnaa chahie ki ucch shiksha ayog ke saamne bhi vahi samasyaayein hongi jo ujisi ke saamne hai
 Many years before 2014 and four years after that, the result of the collection of these problems is that today, youths from all over India rush to Delhi University after passing 12th
 bharat main ek lakh shikshakon kii kami he
 Let me show you a form of how governments play with higher education
 ye jo notification aap dekh rahe hai wo jharkhand central uniwarsity kaa he
 On 25 June, it is uploaded on its website that Jharkhand Central University wants to temporarily reinstate 64 assistant professors
 in sabhi ko ekamusth 55000 maheene kii selary di jaaegi
 The job will be temporary
 magar is notification ke 12 ghante ke bheetar ek sudhaar karti he ki ab unhen 55000 nahin, 35000 kii selary milegi
 It is also Central University
 hamane dilli uniwarsity main asthaayee padhaane vaale shikshakon kii selary se tulana kii to vahaan edock padhaane waalon ko 65000 ke kareeb selary milti he
 a university of the same Government of India gives 35000 to someone and 65000 to someone
 madhya pradesh main to uniwarsity or colejo main shikshak 20,000 ke aas paas kii selary par padhaa rahe hai
 If this is not a joke, then what is a joke? 12 ghante ke bheetar vigyaapan main selary 55 hazaar se ghatakar 35000 ho jaati he
 You feel that students of really good quality will give their lives to such a system
 majaburi main de denge lekin kya unka pehla chunaav hoga? 20 agast 2017 ko 'times of india main maanas kii ek report he
 In which the statement of the Minister of Human Resources has been printed that one third of the posts in iits, nits and Universities are vacant
 nai central uniwarsity main to 53
 28 percent of the posts are vacant
 neshnal institute of technolji main 47 pratishat pad khaali hai
 There are 35 percent vacancies in the new and old iits
 im main bhi 26 pratishat pad khaali hai
 At IIM Indore, 51 percent posts are vacant
 'times of india' kii report main likhaa he ki sarkaar ne sansad ko yah sab jaankaree di he
 You will be aware that more than 70 percent teaching positions are vacant in all the seven AIIMS
 baaki medical collejon ke teaching staff kii list bana rahaa hum, vahaan bhi haalat buree he
 Without a teacher, if you study and become a doctor, there is no need to tell again where this can be amazing
 agast 2017 kii yah report he
 How many posts have been filled at this time, only the HR Minister can tell better
 subah-subah twit kar sakate hai ki central uniwarsity main jo pichley saal tak 6000 se adhik pad khaali the, unamem se kitne par sthaayee niyukti ho chuki he
 i am talking about permanent 20 march 2017 ko maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jawadekar ne kaha tha ki ek saal ke bheetar dilli uniwarsity ke 9000 edock shikshakon ko permanent kar diya gaya
 Is going to be more than a year
 mantriji ko yaad dilaa rahaa hum ki is bare main bhi kal twit kar sakate hai ki 9000 main se kitne edock ko permanent kar chuke hai
 We know it is better to tell right there
 vaise 'times of india' ke mutabik ek april 2017 tak central uniwarsity haryana main 75 fisadi khaali hai
 54 in Delhi University
 75 pratishat pad khaali hai
 Allahabad University has 64 percent vacancies
 bharat main hi 75 pratishat shikshakon ke bina central uniwarsity of haryana chal sakati he yahi jaanane ke liye medhaavi chaatro ko oxfort chhodkar yahaan padhane aana chahie
 You should also enroll your children where there are no teachers
 vaise jahaan bhi karaayenge vahaan shikshak nahin hi honge jo haal he
 By the way, let us tell you that Central University is also considered as autonomous institutions, but every day you see government and political interference there
 hamane aapako pichley dinon bataaya tha ki raamamanohar lohia avadh uniwarsity main biessi third year ke 80 pratishath chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 56 percent of b
sc first year students have failed
 sthaneey media main chapa tha ki avadh uniwarsity main 80 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye
 According to this, when six lakh students took the exam, then there were four lakh 80 thousand
 vishvavidhyalay ke vaais chancelar ne ise hi mudda bana liya ki jab teen lakh se kuch zyada chaatro ke riselt hi nikle hai to 4 lakh 80 hazaar fail ho gaye
 This was a mistake, but we also said that 80 percent of the BSC third year have failed
 first year main 56 pratishat fail hue hai
 Today when our colleague Pramod Srivastava spoke to Vice Chancellor Manoj Dixit, he could not tell how many students appeared in the exam, the total number of students who failed
 vaais chancelar ne fail ke aankade kam dikhaane ke liye sarkari madad praapt or swavitt poshit college ke nateezon main bantwaaraa kar diya
 They have forgotten that the Vice Chancellors are from government aided colleges as well as self-funded colleges
 ek uniwarsity main kathith rup se nakal rokane ke naam par itani badi sankhya main chaatr fail ho jaae kya yah vishwa vidhyalay kii gunvattta par tippanee nahin he
 What is studied there that fails to stop copying? aaj jab pramod ne visi manoj dikshit se baat kii tab unhone nahin bataaya ki kitne chaatro ne pariksha di thi jabaki 22 farvari ke aas paas press conference main khud kaha tha ki 6 lakh se adhik chaatro ne pariksha di thi
 If six lakh students sit for the exam, will the result be six lakhs or three lakhs? VC Dixit said before Pramod that he did not know how many students sat in the examination, Omprakash will tell you
 baad main pramod shrivastav ne jaanane kii koshish ki to yah pataa chalaa ki ye om prakaash uniwarsity ke koi adhikari nahi hai, kisi pad par nahin hai
 Member of Council for Work
 kaayade se visi ko 19 june ke press relies main hi bataanaa chahie tha jab unhone hamaari siries ke baad jari kiya tha or jisamen sarkari or privet collejon main fail hone vaale chaatro kaa pratishat dikhaaya tha, usamen kyon nahin kaha ki 3 lakh se adhik chaatr pariksha hi nahin dene aae kyonki nakal virdohi abhiyaan chal rahaa tha
 On 22 February, VC said that 6,11680 students would be included in the graduation exam
 3,41000 chaatro kaa rigelt niklaa or isamen se 15-16 pratishat fail ho gaye
 Accordingly, the number of students failing is 54,560
 jab visi se poocha gaya ki imtehaan to 6 lakh se adhik chaatro ne diya to unhone kaha ki baaki chaatr nahin aae
 Accordingly, 2,70680 students did not come to take the exam, it is shameful even to fail
 ab aap fail hone vaale or pariksha nahin dene waalon kii sankhya jodie
 This number is 3, 25,240 students are not eligible to pass
 kya yah kisi uniwarsity ke liye sharmnaak nahin he ki form bharne vaale chaatro main se aadhe yaa to imtahaan dene kaa saahas na juta saken or fail ho jaaen
 By the way, Governor Ramnaik should check that indeed more than 2 lakh 7 xxrep 4 0 students left the examination, and left, then why was it not stated on the website at the time of the result
 aaj tak iskaa zikr nahin he
 In the press release of June 19, VC Dixit could tell that about one-third of the three lakh students did not take the exam
 tippaniyan Many colleges in Avadh University do not have teachers in proportion to the number of students
 manzur padon kii sankhya ke hisaab se bhi shikshak nahin hai

 The notification you are seeing is from Jharkhand Central University
 25 june ko isaki website par aplod hota he ki jharkhand central uniwarsity asthaayee rup se 64 sahaayak prophessoron ko behaal karnaa chaahati he
 All these will be given a salary of 55000 months in lump sum
 naukari asthaayee hogi
 But within 12 hours of this notification, there is an improvement that now they will get salary of 35000, not 55000
 yah bhi central uniwarsity he
 When we compared the salary of the temporary teachers in Delhi University, the adhoc teachers there get around 65000 salary
 ek hi bharat sarkaar kii ek uniwarsity kisi ko 35000 detii he or kisi ko 65000
 In Madhya Pradesh, teachers in universities and colleges are teaching at a salary of around 20,000
 agar ye mazaaq nahin to phir mazaaq kya he
 Within 12 hours, the salary in advertising decreases from 55 thousand to 35000
 aapako lagata he ki vaaki acchhee quality ke chaatr apana jivan aisi vyavastha ko denge
 Will give in compulsion but will he have his first election? On 20 August 2017, there is a report of Manas in the Times of India
 jisamen maanav sansaadhan mantri kaa bayaan chapa he ki iaiti, enaiti or universti main ek tihaai pad khaali hai
 So 53 at New Central University
 28 pratishat pad khaali hai
 National Institute of Technology has 47 percent vacancies
 nae or puraani iaiti main 35 pratishat pad khaali hai
 At IIM too, 26 percent of the posts are vacant
 im indore main to 51 pratishat pad khaali hai
 The Times of India report states that the government has given all this information to the Parliament
 aapako pataa hi hoga ki saaton ames main teaching ke 70 fisadi se adhik pad khaali hai
 i am making a list of teaching staff of other medical colleges, the situation is also bad there
 bina teacher ke aap padhakar doctor ho jaae yah kamaal kahaan ho saktaa he, yah baar-baar bataane kii zarurat nahin he
 This is the report for August 2017
 is vakt kitne pad bhare ja chuke hai maanav sansaadhan mantri hi behatar bataa sakate he
 In the morning, one can tweet that till last year, more than 6000 posts were vacant in Central University, how many of them have got permanent appointment
 permanent kii baat kar rahaa hum
 On 20 March 2017, Human Resource Minister Prakash Javadekar had said that 9000 adhoc teachers of Delhi University were permanent within a year
 ek saal se zyaada hone ja rahaa he
 Reminding the Minister that i can also tweet tomorrow about how many of the 9000 have admanked
 hamen to pataa he behatar he vahiin bataa den
 According to 'times of India', as of April 1, 2017, Central University Haryana has 75 percent vacancies
 dilli uniwarsity main 54
 75 percent posts are vacant
 elahabaad uniwarsity main 64 fisadi pad khaali hai
 In India itself, meritorious students should leave Oxfort and study here to know that Central University of Haryana can run without 75 percent teachers
 aap bhi apane bacchon kaa namakan vahiin karaaen jahaan shikshak nahin hai
 By the way, wherever you do, there will be no teachers, which is the condition
 vaise aapako bataa den ki central uniwarsity bhi swytt sansthaaen maani jaati hai, magar aae din aap vahaan sarkari or raajnneetik hastkshep dekhte rahete hai
 We told you recently that 80 percent of BSC third year students have failed at Ram Manohar Lohia Awadh University
 biessi pratham varsh ke 56 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 It was published in the local media that 80 percent of the students at Awadh University failed
 is hisaab se jab chah lakh chaatro ne pariksha di thi to chaar lakh 80 hazaar hue
 The Vice Chancellor of the University made it a point that when the results of more than three lakh students have come out, then 4 lakh 80 thousand have failed
 ye chook thi magar hamane ye bhi kaha tha ki biessi third year main 80 pratishat fail hue hai
 56 percent failed in the first year
 aaj vaais chancelar manoj dikshit se jab hamaare sahyogi pramod shrivastav ne baat kii to ve nahin bataa sake ki kitne chaatr pariksha main baithe the, fail hone vaale chaatro kii kul sankhya kitni he
 The Vice Chancellor divided the results of the government-aided and self-funded college to show a lower Fail figure
 ve yah bhul gaye ki vaais chancelar sarkari madad praapt collejon ke bhi hai or swavitt poshit collejon ke bhi
 Should such a large number of students fail in the name of alleged copying in a university, is this not a comment on the quality of the university
 vahaan kya padhai hoti he ki nakal rokane par fail ho jate hai
 Today when Pramod spoke to VC Manoj Dixit, he did not tell how many students had taken the exam, while in the press conference around 22 February itself, he said that more than 6 lakh students had taken the exam
 chah lakh chaatr pariksha main baithenge to rigelt chah lakh kaa nikalegaa yaa teen lakh kaa nikalegaa? visi dikshit ne pramod se pehle kaha ki nahin maaloom kitne chaatr pariksha main baithe the, aapako omprakash bataa denge
 Later, Pramod Shrivastava tried to know that it was found that he is not an officer of Om Prakash University, he is not in any position
 kaary parishad ke sadsy hai
 As a matter of fact, the VC should have told in the press release of June 19 when he released after our series and showed the percentage of students failing in government and private colleges, why did not he say that more than 3 lakh students exam Did not come only because anti-copying campaign was going on
 22 farvari ko visi ne kaha tha ki snaatak kii pariksha main 6,11680 chaatr shaamil honge
 Result of 3,41000 students came out and 15-16 percent of it failed
 is hisaab se fail hone vaale chaatro kii sankhya hoti he 54,560
 When VC was asked if more than 6 lakh students gave Imtehan, they said that the remaining students did not come
 is hisaab se 2,70680 chaatr pariksha dene nahin aae, ye to fail se bhi sharmnaak he
 Now add the number of people who failed and did not take the exam
 yah sankhya hoti 3, 25,240 chaatr paas hone laayak nahin hai
 Isn't it embarrassing for a university that half of the students who fill the form either fail to muster the courage to take the exam and fail
 vaise rajyapal ramnike ko check karnaa chahie ki vaaki 2 lakh 7 xxrep 4 0 se adhik chaatro ne pariksha chhod di, or chhod di to yah baat rigelt ke samay kyon nahin website par bataai gai
 Till date it is not mentioned
 19 june kii press relies main visi dikshit bataa sakate the ki kareeb paune teen lakh chaatro ne pariksha hi nahin di
 The comments avadh uniwarsity ke kai collejon main chaatro kii sankhya ke anupaat main shikshak nahin hai
 There are also no teachers according to the number of posts sanctioned
 agar yahi quality shiksha kii rahegi to in uniwarsity ko band kar dena chahie kyonki whants ap uniwarsity to chal hi rahi he
 The results of Kanpur University and Bundelkhand University are also in bad shape
 yaha sirf bie biessi or bikom main 2 lakh 18 hazaar 28 chaatro ne pariksha di thi, isamen se 1 lakh 22 hazaar 583 chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 About 50 percent of the students have failed in Bundelkhand
 sara shrey nakal rokane ko lekar he magar uniwarsity main padhai kii gunvattta kab sudharegi
 Is it good that a university has only 40 percent students
 biessi part van main to 12
 Only 5 percent of the students have passed and the rest have failed
 koi 26000 chaatr fail hai
 Around 24000 students have failed in BSC Part Two
 yah pataa nahin ki biessi main hi 50,000 se adhik chaatr fail hai
 In all courses in Bandelkhand University, 2 lakh 43 thousand students had taken the exam, out of which only 95,445 students have passed
 baaki sab fail
 This is the condition of our higher education
 na teacher hai na principal hai na chaatr paas hone laayak hai
 You can understand what the result will be
 madhya pradesh main to uniwarsity or colejo main shikshak 20,000 ke aas paas kii selary par padhaa rahe hai
 If this is not a joke, then what is a joke? 12 ghante ke bheetar vigyaapan main selary 55 hazaar se ghatakar 35000 ho jaati he
 You feel that students of really good quality will give their lives to such a system
 majaburi main de denge lekin kya unka pehla chunaav hoga? 20 agast 2017 ko 'times of india main maanas kii ek report he
 In which the statement of the Minister of Human Resources has been printed that one third of the posts in iits, nits and Universities are vacant
 nai central uniwarsity main to 53
 28 percent of the posts are vacant
 neshnal institute of technolji main 47 pratishat pad khaali hai

 You will be aware that more than 70 percent teaching positions are vacant in all the seven AIIMS
 baaki medical collejon ke teaching staff kii list bana rahaa hum, vahaan bhi haalat buree he
 Without a teacher, if you study and become a doctor, there is no need to tell again where this can be amazing

 How many posts have been filled at this time, only the HR Minister can tell better
 subah-subah twit kar sakate hai ki central uniwarsity main jo pichley saal tak 6000 se adhik pad khaali the, unamem se kitne par sthaayee niyukti ho chuki he
 i am talking about permanent 20 march 2017 ko maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jawadekar ne kaha tha ki ek saal ke bheetar dilli uniwarsity ke 9000 edock shikshakon ko permanent kar diya gaya

 Allahabad University has 64 percent vacancies
 bharat main hi 75 pratishat shikshakon ke bina central uniwarsity of haryana chal sakati he yahi jaanane ke liye medhaavi chaatro ko oxfort chhodkar yahaan padhane aana chahie
 You should also enroll your children where there are no teachers

 By the way, let us tell you that Central University is also considered as autonomous institutions, but every day you see government and political interference there
 hamane aapako pichley dinon bataaya tha ki raamamanohar lohia avadh uniwarsity main biessi third year ke 80 pratishath chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 56 percent of b
sc first year students have failed
 sthaneey media main chapa tha ki avadh uniwarsity main 80 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye
 According to this, when six lakh students took the exam, then there were four lakh 80 thousand
 vishvavidhyalay ke vaais chancelar ne ise hi mudda bana liya ki jab teen lakh se kuch zyada chaatro ke riselt hi nikle hai to 4 lakh 80 hazaar fail ho gaye
 This was a mistake, but we also said that 80 percent of the BSC third year have failed
 first year main 56 pratishat fail hue hai
 Today when our colleague Pramod Srivastava spoke to Vice Chancellor Manoj Dixit, he could not tell how many students appeared in the exam, the total number of students who failed
 vaais chancelar ne fail ke aankade kam dikhaane ke liye sarkari madad praapt or swavitt poshit college ke nateezon main bantwaaraa kar diya
 They have forgotten that the Vice Chancellors are from government aided colleges as well as self-funded colleges
 ek uniwarsity main kathith rup se nakal rokane ke naam par itani badi sankhya main chaatr fail ho jaae kya yah vishwa vidhyalay kii gunvattta par tippanee nahin he

 If six lakh students sit for the exam, will the result be six lakhs or three lakhs? VC Dixit said before Pramod that he did not know how many students sat in the examination, Omprakash will tell you

 On 22 February, VC said that 6,11680 students would be included in the graduation exam
 3,41000 chaatro kaa rigelt niklaa or isamen se 15-16 pratishat fail ho gaye
 Accordingly, the number of students failing is 54,560
 jab visi se poocha gaya ki imtehaan to 6 lakh se adhik chaatro ne diya to unhone kaha ki baaki chaatr nahin aae
 Accordingly, 2,70680 students did not come to take the exam, it is shameful even to fail
 ab aap fail hone vaale or pariksha nahin dene waalon kii sankhya jodie
 This number is 3, 25,240 students are not eligible to pass
 kya yah kisi uniwarsity ke liye sharmnaak nahin he ki form bharne vaale chaatro main se aadhe yaa to imtahaan dene kaa saahas na juta saken or fail ho jaaen
 By the way, Governor Ramnaik should check that indeed more than 2 lakh 7 xxrep 4 0 students left the exam, and left, then why was it not stated on the website at the time of the result
 aaj tak iskaa zikr nahin he
 In the press release of June 19, VC Dixit could tell that about one-third of the three lakh students did not take the exam
 tippaniyan Many colleges in Avadh University do not have teachers in proportion to the number of students
 manzur padon kii sankhya ke hisaab se bhi shikshak nahin hai
 If this quality education remains, then these universities should be closed because what is app university is going on
 kanpur uniwarsity or bundelkhand uniwarsity ke nateezon kaa bhi bura haal he
 Only 2 lakh 18 thousand 28 students took the exam in BA b
sc and b
com here, out of which 1 lakh 22 thousand 583 students have failed
 kareeb kareeb 50 fisadi chaatr bundelkhand main fail hai
 All the credit is about stopping copying, but when will the quality of studies in the university improve
 kya yah acchhee baat he ki ek uniwarsity main sirf 40 pratishat chaatr paas hon
 So 12 in BSC Part One
 5 pratishat chaatr hi paas hue hai baaki sab fail hai
 Some 26000 students have failed
 biessi part tu main bhi 24000 ke kareeb chaatr fail hai
 It is not known that more than 50,000 students have failed in BSC itself
 bandelkhand uniwarsity main sabhi course main kul milakar 2 lakh 43 hazaar chaatro ne pariksha di thi, jisamen se 95,445 chaatr hi paas hue he
 Everyone else failed
 ye he hamaari ucch shiksha kaa haal
 There are neither teachers nor principals nor students are eligible to pass
 nateeja kya hoga aap samaj sakate hai
 So 53 at New Central University
 28 pratishat pad khaali hai
 National Institute of Technology has 47 percent vacancies
 nae or puraani iaiti main 35 pratishat pad khaali hai
 At IIM too, 26 percent of the posts are vacant
 im indore main to 51 pratishat pad khaali hai
 The Times of India report states that the government has given all this information to the Parliament
 aapako pataa hi hoga ki saaton ames main teaching ke 70 fisadi se adhik pad khaali hai
 i am making a list of teaching staff of other medical colleges, the situation is also bad there
 bina teacher ke aap padhakar doctor ho jaae yah kamaal kahaan ho saktaa he, yah baar-baar bataane kii zarurat nahin he
 This is the report for August 2017
 is vakt kitne pad bhare ja chuke hai maanav sansaadhan mantri hi behatar bataa sakate he
 In the morning, one can tweet that till last year, more than 6000 posts were vacant in Central University, how many of them have got permanent appointment
 permanent kii baat kar rahaa hum
 On 20 March 2017, Human Resource Minister Prakash Javadekar had said that 9000 adhoc teachers of Delhi University were permanent within a year
 ek saal se zyaada hone ja rahaa he
 Reminding the Minister that i can also tweet tomorrow about how many of the 9000 have admanked
 hamen to pataa he behatar he vahiin bataa den
 According to 'times of India', as of April 1, 2017, Central University Haryana has 75 percent vacancies
 dilli uniwarsity main 54
 75 percent posts are vacant
 elahabaad uniwarsity main 64 fisadi pad khaali hai
 In India itself, meritorious students should leave Oxfort and study here to know that Central University of Haryana can run without 75 percent teachers
 aap bhi apane bacchon kaa namakan vahiin karaaen jahaan shikshak nahin hai
 By the way, wherever you do, there will be no teachers, which is the condition
 vaise aapako bataa den ki central uniwarsity bhi swytt sansthaaen maani jaati hai, magar aae din aap vahaan sarkari or raajnneetik hastkshep dekhte rahete hai
 We told you recently that 80 percent of BSC third year students have failed at Ram Manohar Lohia Awadh University
 biessi pratham varsh ke 56 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 It was published in the local media that 80 percent of the students at Awadh University failed
 is hisaab se jab chah lakh chaatro ne pariksha di thi to chaar lakh 80 hazaar hue
 The Vice Chancellor of the University made it a point that when the results of more than three lakh students have come out, then 4 lakh 80 thousand have failed
 ye chook thi magar hamane ye bhi kaha tha ki biessi third year main 80 pratishat fail hue hai
 56 percent failed in the first year
 aaj vaais chancelar manoj dikshit se jab hamaare sahyogi pramod shrivastav ne baat kii to ve nahin bataa sake ki kitne chaatr pariksha main baithe the, fail hone vaale chaatro kii kul sankhya kitni he
 The Vice Chancellor divided the results of the government-aided and self-funded college to show a lower Fail figure
 ve yah bhul gaye ki vaais chancelar sarkari madad praapt collejon ke bhi hai or swavitt poshit collejon ke bhi
 Should such a large number of students fail in the name of alleged copying in a university, is this not a comment on the quality of the university
 vahaan kya padhai hoti he ki nakal rokane par fail ho jate hai
 Today when Pramod spoke to VC Manoj Dixit, he did not tell how many students had taken the exam, while in the press conference around 22 February itself, he said that more than 6 lakh students had taken the exam
 chah lakh chaatr pariksha main baithenge to rigelt chah lakh kaa nikalegaa yaa teen lakh kaa nikalegaa? visi dikshit ne pramod se pehle kaha ki nahin maaloom kitne chaatr pariksha main baithe the, aapako omprakash bataa denge
 Later, Pramod Shrivastava tried to know that it was found that he is not an officer of Om Prakash University, he is not in any position
 kaary parishad ke sadsy hai
 As a matter of fact, the VC should have told in the press release of June 19 when he released after our series and showed the percentage of students failing in government and private colleges, why did not he say that more than 3 lakh students exam Did not come only because anti-copying campaign was going on
 22 farvari ko visi ne kaha tha ki snaatak kii pariksha main 6,11680 chaatr shaamil honge
 Result of 3,41000 students came out and 15-16 percent of it failed
 is hisaab se fail hone vaale chaatro kii sankhya hoti he 54,560
 When VC was asked if more than 6 lakh students gave Imtehan, they said that the remaining students did not come
 is hisaab se 2,70680 chaatr pariksha dene nahin aae, ye to fail se bhi sharmnaak he
 Now add the number of people who failed and did not take the exam
 yah sankhya hoti 3, 25,240 chaatr paas hone laayak nahin hai
 Isn't it embarrassing for a university that half of the students who fill the form either fail to muster the courage to take the exam and fail
 vaise rajyapal ramnike ko check karnaa chahie ki vaaki 2 lakh 7 xxrep 4 0 se adhik chaatro ne pariksha chhod di, or chhod di to yah baat rigelt ke samay kyon nahin website par bataai gai
 Till date it is not mentioned
 19 june kii press relies main visi dikshit bataa sakate the ki kareeb paune teen lakh chaatro ne pariksha hi nahin di
 The comments avadh uniwarsity ke kai collejon main chaatro kii sankhya ke anupaat main shikshak nahin hai
 There are also no teachers according to the number of posts sanctioned
 agar yahi quality shiksha kii rahegi to in uniwarsity ko band kar dena chahie kyonki whants ap uniwarsity to chal hi rahi he
 The results of Kanpur University and Bundelkhand University are also in bad shape
 yaha sirf bie biessi or bikom main 2 lakh 18 hazaar 28 chaatro ne pariksha di thi, isamen se 1 lakh 22 hazaar 583 chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 About 50 percent of the students have failed in Bundelkhand
 sara shrey nakal rokane ko lekar he magar uniwarsity main padhai kii gunvattta kab sudharegi
 Is it good that a university has only 40 percent students
 biessi part van main to 12
 Only 5 percent of the students have passed and the rest have failed
 koi 26000 chaatr fail hai
 Around 24000 students have failed in BSC Part Two
 yah pataa nahin ki biessi main hi 50,000 se adhik chaatr fail hai
 In all courses in Bandelkhand University, 2 lakh 43 thousand students had taken the exam, out of which only 95,445 students have passed
 baaki sab fail
 This is the condition of our higher education
 na teacher hai na principal hai na chaatr paas hone laayak hai
 You can understand what the result will be
 'times of india' kii report main likhaa he ki sarkaar ne sansad ko yah sab jaankaree di he
 You will be aware that more than 70 percent teaching positions are vacant in all the seven AIIMS

 Should such a large number of students fail in the name of alleged copying in a university, is this not a comment on the quality of the university
 vahaan kya padhai hoti he ki nakal rokane par fail ho jate hai
 Today when Pramod spoke to VC Manoj Dixit, he did not tell how many students had taken the exam, while in the press conference around 22 February itself, he said that more than 6 lakh students had taken the exam
 chah lakh chaatr pariksha main baithenge to rigelt chah lakh kaa nikalegaa yaa teen lakh kaa nikalegaa? visi dikshit ne pramod se pehle kaha ki nahin maaloom kitne chaatr pariksha main baithe the, aapako omprakash bataa denge
 Later, Pramod Shrivastava tried to know that it was found that he is not an officer of Om Prakash University, he is not in any position
 kaary parishad ke sadsy hai
 As a matter of fact, the VC should have told in the press release of June 19 when he released after our series and showed the percentage of students failing in government and private colleges, why did not he say that more than 3 lakh students exam Did not come only because anti-copying campaign was going on
 22 farvari ko visi ne kaha tha ki snaatak kii pariksha main 6,11680 chaatr shaamil honge
 Result of 3,41000 students came out and 15-16 percent of it failed
 is hisaab se fail hone vaale chaatro kii sankhya hoti he 54,560
 When VC was asked if more than 6 lakh students gave Imtehan, they said that the remaining students did not come
 is hisaab se 2,70680 chaatr pariksha dene nahin aae, ye to fail se bhi sharmnaak he
 Now add the number of people who failed and did not take the exam
 yah sankhya hoti 3, 25,240 chaatr paas hone laayak nahin hai
 Isn't it embarrassing for a university that half of the students who fill the form either fail to muster the courage to take the exam and fail
 vaise rajyapal ramnike ko check karnaa chahie ki vaaki 2 lakh 7 xxrep 4 0 se adhik chaatro ne pariksha chhod di, or chhod di to yah baat rigelt ke samay kyon nahin website par bataai gai
 Till date it is not mentioned
 19 june kii press relies main visi dikshit bataa sakate the ki kareeb paune teen lakh chaatro ne pariksha hi nahin di
 The comments avadh uniwarsity ke kai collejon main chaatro kii sankhya ke anupaat main shikshak nahin hai
 There are also no teachers according to the number of posts sanctioned
 agar yahi quality shiksha kii rahegi to in uniwarsity ko band kar dena chahie kyonki whants ap uniwarsity to chal hi rahi he
 The results of Kanpur University and Bundelkhand University are also in bad shape
 yaha sirf bie biessi or bikom main 2 lakh 18 hazaar 28 chaatro ne pariksha di thi, isamen se 1 lakh 22 hazaar 583 chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 About 50 percent of the students have failed in Bundelkhand
 sara shrey nakal rokane ko lekar he magar uniwarsity main padhai kii gunvattta kab sudharegi
 Is it good that a university has only 40 percent students
 biessi part van main to 12
 Only 5 percent of the students have passed and the rest have failed
 koi 26000 chaatr fail hai
 Around 24000 students have failed in BSC Part Two
 yah pataa nahin ki biessi main hi 50,000 se adhik chaatr fail hai
 In all courses in Bandelkhand University, 2 lakh 43 thousand students had taken the exam, out of which only 95,445 students have passed
 baaki sab fail
 This is the condition of our higher education

 kya yah kisi uniwarsity ke liye sharmnaak nahin he ki form bharne vaale chaatro main se aadhe yaa to imtahaan dene kaa saahas na juta saken or fail ho jaaen
 By the way, Governor Ramnaik should check that indeed more than 2 lakh 7 xxrep 4 0 students left the examination, and left, then why was it not stated on the website at the time of the result
 aaj tak iskaa zikr nahin he
 In the press release of June 19, VC Dixit could tell that about one-third of the three lakh students did not take the exam
