 Earlier in the police interrogation, Prashant has made such shocking revelations, which are surprising
 prashanth nat ne subodh kumaar singh par goli chalaai thi, is baat ko usne sweekaar kar to liya he, magar ab ye bhi baat saamne ai he ki subodh kumaar singh par pehle kulhadi se hamalaa kiya gaya tha or unhen jalaane kii bhi koshish kii gai
 It is being told that Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh was shot by snatching his license revolver
 itnaa hi nahin, goli maarane se pehle kalua naam ke ek or aaropee ne kulhadi se subodh singh ke sir par waar kiya tha
 At the same time, he also cut the thumb of Subodh Singh
 darasal, 3 disambar ko buldashahar hinsa main inspector subodh singh kii maut ko lekar dil dahala deni vaali baaten saamne ai hai
 After Gaukashi, the violent mob was explaining to Inspector Subodh Kumar, when a man named Kalua attacked the inspector with an ax
 pehle kiye waar se inspector subodh kumaar kii ungali cat gai
 Yet Kalua was not considered and due to the constant blows, Subodh Kumar's head was also shattered by the ax
 subodh kumaar apni jaan bachaane ke liye khet kii taraf bhaage, jahaan par 31 saal ke prashanth nat or uske saathiyon ne subodh kumaar ko pakad liya
 Subodh Kumar fired in self-defense, killing a boy named Sumit, after which Prashanth Nut and his associates snatched the license revolver of Subodh
 revolver chhinane ke baad johny naam ke ek shaks ne subodh kumaar ko pakad kar ghutanon ke bal baitha diya or prashanth nat ne subodh kumaar kii hi revolver se subodh kumaar ko goli maar di
 These people did not stop in this only, they also attacked Subodh Kumar's dead body with sticks and stones
 thodi der baad jab baaqi police vaale patharav ke bich subodh kumaar ke sharir ko gaadi main daal kar le jane lage to bheed ne gaadi par hi patharav kar diya jiske baad police vaale subodh kumaar ko chhod kar bhaag gaye
 The miscreants took the vehicle into their possession and also tried to burn Subodh Kumar along with the vehicle
 lekin kisi tarah police waalon ne subodh kumaar ko jalane se bachaaya
 Prashanth Nut was identified on the basis of several videos Prashant had lost since the incident along with his family
 kulhadi se waar karne vaale kalua kii police ab bhi talash kar rahi he
 Actually, Yogesh Raj is still the main accused of inciting violence
 3 disambar ko gaukashi ke baad hui hinsa main inspector subodh kumaar singh (subodh Kumar Singh) kii hatya kii gai thi
 Explain that earlier, the police arrested Jeetu Fauji in the murder of Inspector

 At the same time, in the violence erupted on the issue of Gokshi in Bulandshahar, the family members of the martyr Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh had alleged that the evidence of this incident is being erased

 com / fzbtmrbruh — ANI (@ANI) September 29, 2018 PM is strong-willed On Monday in Muzaffarnagar, UP, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that India is no longer a weak country, but has now become a powerful country of the world
 rajnath singh sargical strike jaise bade oparation ke liye pradhanmantri narendramodiko credit diya
 He said, 'our Prime Minister has shown strong will power
 jiske baad hamaare javaanon ne karishma kar dikhaaya or pakistan kii dharti par unka safaya karne main hamaare javaanon ne kamyaabi hasil kii jise sargical strike kehete hai
 Rajnath Singh said on China also on the india-china border, Rajnath Singh told that the soldiers told him what happens on the border
 rajnath singh ne bataaya, 'javaanon ne mujhase kaha ki udhar se log aate hai or phase-ap hota he
 Those people do not even remove weapons, we also do not extract weapons
 phir ek duusare ko dhakka mukki karte hai or wo vaapis chale jate hai
 Describing such relations with China as a symbol of India's victory, Rajnath Singh said that it is the same China that attacked India, but the border is only pushed and left each other by thanking
 iskaa matlab ye he ki bharat ab ek taqatwar mulk ban gaya he
 Let me tell you that in the night of 28-29 September in 2016, the soldiers of the Indian Army penetrated into the Pakistan border and attacked for about 3 kilometers
 is sargical strike main kareeb 50 aatanki maare gaye the or kai aatanki camp puri tarah se tabah bhi hue the
 This was also the first time that the Indian Army attacked Pakistani camps and announced it
 ajit pavaar kaa bijepi ke saath jane ke peeche pavaar kii rajamandi he yaa nahinsupriya sule ke liye chunauti khadi ho gai, rashtriya str par simatinmaharashtra main aisa siyaasi game hua he ki shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare kaa mukhyamantri banane kaa armaan chur-chur ho gaya he
 Before the formation of Shiv sena-congress-ncp government in the state, Sharad Pawar's nephew Ajit Pawar became deputy CM by supporting BJP
 is nae ghatnakram ke baad sawaal khadey ho rahe hai ki ajit pavaar kaa bijepi ke saath jane ke peeche sharad pavaar kii rajamandi he yaa nahin
 Sharad Pawar's answer has come, but questions are being raised that will the political career of Sharad Pawar come to an end due to the reshuffle in the politics of Maharashtra? Will the political career end? People were not able to get up properly on Saturday morning in Mumbai
 Devendra Fadnavis was sworn in as CM and Ajit Pawar as Deputy CM
 aise main sawaal he ki ajit pavaar ne maharashtra ke chanakya maane jane vaale sharad pavaar kii rajamandi se kiya he
 If this has happened, then Sharad Pawar will lose his political credibility
 aise main bhavishya main unki baton ko lekar koi bhi dal gambhirtha nahin dikhaaenge or na hi raajnneeti main unke saath koi kadam badha sakegaa
 In such a situation, there may be a cloud of crisis on the political path of Sharad Pawar's future
 haalanki sharad pavaar ne saaf kar diya he ki yah samarthan ensipi kaa nahin he
 Senior journalist Ashutosh said that if Sharad Pawar is standing behind the formation of Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar's government, it will affect his politics
 sharad pavaar kii apni vishwasaneeyata khone ke saath-saath ensipi kaa siyaasi kariyar bhi khatm ho jayega
 Sangh ideologue Sangeet Ragi said that Sharad Pawar and NCP will stand behind Ajit Pawar
 aisa agar nahin he to ajit pavaar ke jane se ensipi khatm ho jaaegi
 NCP has lost its grip! If Sharad Pawar is not standing behind Ajit Pawar, then in such a situation, it is clear that now he is no longer on the party
 ajit pavaar ke saath jis tarah se 25 se 30 vidhayakon ke samarthan kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 It is clear that Ajit Pawar has disbanded the NCP
 sharad pavaar kii beti supriya sule bhi maan rahi hai ki parivaar or party donon tut gai he
 Supriya Sule has said, 'why trust someone in life, i have never felt myself so cheated before
 jise itnaa pyaar kiya, bachaav kiya, badale main dekho kya mila
 'supriya Sule's politics graph, in which Sharad Pawar is standing at the age of age, in such a situation, it will be a big challenge for him to reinstate NCP
 supriya sule kaa raajnneeti graph puure maharashtra main nahin he
 Not only this, she has been active in national politics more than state politics
 aise main ajit pavaar ke saamne supriya sule apane aapako kitna sthapit kar paati hai
 This will be a big challenge

 It is a different matter on which land is so divine that only the public will tell it, but at the moment the crowd of Makar Sankranti taking a bath definitely showed the divinity of the statistics of administration
 makar sankranti ke snaan ke baad takreeban shaam 5:00 baje mela prashasan ne press conference kiya or sangam main dubkee lagane waalon kii sankhya bataai
 It is said that more than 56 lakh people took bath in Kumbh on 14 January and one crore 40 lakh people on 15 January
 mela prashasan ke is daawey main kaha gaya ki yah motaa motaa anumaan he
 All the journalists present there were shocked by this figure and said in a very sarcastic tone that something will be thicker or will remain so, "2 crores should be considered as official, more figures will come to be considered as final, now it is increased then Mauni Amavasya Will also increase
 '''svachh kumbh' ke daavon kii khuli pole: pehle hi din hajaaron toilet kharaab, khule main shouch karne ko majaboor shraddhalupatrakaron ke is vyangatmak andaaz se mela adhikariyon par to koi asar nahin hua lekin vahaan maujuud jitne patrkaar the vah sab is aankadebaaji se ittefaq nahin rakh rahe the or vah patrkaar bhi ittefaq nahin rakh rahe the jo teen dashakon se elahabaad main patrakarita kar rahe hai
 In this one, Surendra Pratap Singh said, "the fair administration is saying that 2 crore people took bath, it will not hug anyone
 sava do karod snaan kara dena lagata he ki divya kumbh he
 Now the second thing is that even if 33 crore gods are added, there can be a lot of visible and invisible
 meraa maananaa he ki drishy to nahin ho saktaa
 'kumbh Mela 2019: If your children get lost in Kumbh Mela, then contact them
 In the last Kumbh, for the first time, the polynomial method of statistics was used to predict the arrival of crowds
 lekin isse itar ek samanya vidhi se sankhyaki ke jaankaar bataate hai ki ek aadmi ko snaan karne ke liye point 25 skhwaayar meter kii jagah chaiye
 It will take 15 minutes to take a bath
 aise main ek ghante main 12 hazaar 500 log snaan kar sakate hai
 If a bath lasts for 18 hours, only 2 lakh 25 thousand people can take bath
 kumbh kshetra main takreeban 35 ghat hi banaaye gaye hai; in ghaaton main kitni bheed snaan kar rahi isaki koi sateek vidhi mela prashasan ke paas nahin he
 This is evident from the talk of Additional Fair Officer Dilip Kumar Trigunayak who says, "the ghats that we have here, the number of people who bathe in half an hour to an hour, is such an assessment
 photographi yaa videographi se kiya jaataa he
 There is no digital mapping of this kind of data to be told
 ''kumbh 2019 : kendriya mantri smriti irani ne sangam main lagaai dubkee, piem modi ne di kumbh par desh ko shubhakamanaayenis aankade kii or haqiqat jaanane ke liye NDTV kii team shahar ke bas stand or railway stesan kaa gauge liya to vahaan bheed kaa namonishaan nahin tha
 The railway station did not get crowded, but to control the crowd the barrier near the station must be closed due to which the passengers appeared to be upset
 ilahabaad stesan par haryana se aaye ramesh mittal or unke saathi train ke intazaar main baithe nazar aaye jo banaras or vindhyachal gum kar kumbh main dubkee lagane pahunche the
 When we asked him about the crowd, his guess was different from the administration
 ramesh mittal (zind haryana nivasee) ne kaha, 'anumaan lagbhag 20 lakh ke aas paas rahaa hoga, kyonki subah kaa jo time tha shahi snaan kaa us vakt bheed bahut thi
 There were heads everywhere, but now when we are returning, the crowd is not so much
 abhi prashasan se ye bhi vinati he ki bheed ko dekhte hue unhen raste thode kholane chahie the
 'the first royal bath of Kumbh 2019 started from Makar Sankranti, see this beautiful scene in photos, it will require the same large-scale transport to bring 2 crore people
 rail vibhaag ne 37 mela special trainen chalaai thim isamen 200 regular trainen bhi jod den or saath main 500 mela special bas, logon ke privet vaahan ke aankade ko bhi mila len to bhi itane log 50 lakh kii aabaadi vaale prayagraj shahar main nahin aa sakate
 It is clear that with the juggling of figures to take a dip in Kumbh, it cannot be put on the ground of reality

 pakistan ke purv taanashaah parvej musharraf par maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi ek vishesh adaalat ne aaj deshadroh kaa abhiyog lagaaya
 He has become the first military ruler to face criminal prosecution
 adaalat main pesh hue musharraf dhara 6 ke tahat deshadroh ke aaropee hai
 The case relates to him suspending, destroying and repealing the constitution in November 2007, imposing emergency and detaining judges of the top courts
 pakistan ke itihaas main 70 varshiya musharraf aise pehle sainya shaasha hai, jin par adaalat main abhiyog chalegaa
 However, Musharraf has denied all the allegations against him
 musharraf ne kaha, maine jo kuch bhi kiya, desh ke liye kiya
 i am sad that i am being called a traitor
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki unhone pakistan kii sena ko apane jivan ke 44 saal die hai or raksha balon ko majboot banaaya
 Musharraf said that he gave prestige and progress to the country
 iske jawaab main abhiyojak akram shaikh ne kaha ki unhone ‘deshadrohi’ shabd kaa istemaal kabhi nahin kiya he
 Sindh High Court Judge Faisal Arab read out the charges against the former army chief
 abhiyog lagaae jane se pehle musharraf kii bachaav team ke ek nae vakil farog naseem ne adaalat se aagrah kiya ki unke muvakkil ko unki 95 varshiya biimaar maa ko dekhne sanyukt arab emirate jane kii ijaajat di jaae
 He said that the constitution does not allow anyone to restrict the activities of any citizen
 naseem ne kaha ki musharraf swechha se adaalat pahunche, unke muvakkil ke khilaaf warrant taamil nahin kiya gaya tha
 He said that his client is also unwell and that the correct treatment of Musharraf is possible only in America
 bachaav paksh ne is sambandh main do aavedan daayar kiye hai
 The court said that it will consider them later today
 14march ke aadesh ke anupaalan main musharraf kii peshi kii sambhaavna ke maddenjar aaj adaalat main suraksha ke kade bandobast kiye gaye the
 Musharraf was admitted to the Armed Forces Heart Disease Hospital in Rawalpindi on January 2 after complaining of a heart problem on his way to court
 pakistan ke 66 saal ke itihaas main kareeb aadhe vakt tak sena ne shashan kiya he or musharraf se pehle kisi bhi shaasha yaa sainya commaur ko aapraadhik abhiyog kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa he
 Musharraf is facing four major prosecutions, including the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and the 2006 killing of Baloch nationalist leader Akbar Bugti, after he returned from self-exile in March last year
 purv bhartiya captain saurav ganguli ne kaha ki vartmaan captain mahendra singh dhoni or virendra sahvaag ne apane matbhedon ko sulajhaa liya he
 Ganguly told reporters during an event that he spoke to Sehwag who said that everything has been sorted out between Dhoni and him
 austrailia main trikoniya shrinkhalaa ke dauraan teen salaami ballebaajon sachin tendulkar, sahvaag or gautam gambhir ke liye roteshan niti apnaane ke kaaran dhoni or sahvaag ke bich matbhed kii report aayi thi
 Ganguly was asked when it is believed that Dhoni is not giving a chance to many players and prefers to play with the fix team
 unhone kaha, ‘prayek captain alag tarah kaa hota he or koi bhi captain parfect nahin hota
 It is possible that Dhoni is confident that this team can win because no captain wants to lose
 ’ganguli se poocha gaya ki yadi vah captain hote to kya manoj tiwari or ashok dinda kaa mauka dete, unhone kaha, ‘main shaayad unhen mauka detaa lekin ummid he dhoni bhi in khilaadiyon ko mauka denge
 'he said,' Manoj, Dinda and Wriddhiman Saha are three good players in the Bengal team
 ve antarrashtriya str ke khilaadi hai
 This is a good sign for Bengal
 iske alaava mohammad sami bhi acha khilaadi he

 Naxalites claimed this by throwing a form in Naxal-affected areas

 This pamphlet was distributed throughout the area
 maovadiyon kii ore se jari parche main is baat kaa khandan kiya gaya ki unke netaa paparav kii maut ho gai he
 a few days before the police was quoted, it was reported that Maoist leader Paparao had been bitten by a snake
 jisaki vajah se uski maut ho gai
 Naxalites have denied this in their pamphlets
 naksaliyon ke parche main kaha gaya ki paparav kii maut kii khabar keval police kii sajeesh thi
 The police did this to weaken the Naxalite movement
 gauratlab he ki police naksal virdohi abhiyaan ke tahat maovadiyon ke aatmasamarpan or encounter kiye jane kaa abhiyaan chalaa rahi he
 Director Rajkumar Hirani, who is going to produce a film based on the life of actor Sanjay Dutt, says that he is not a friend of Dutt but they both respect each other
 ‘munnabhai’ series main kaam karne vaale hiraani bahut jald dutt ke jivan ko bade parde par dikhaane ja rahe hai
 Hirani says' i have worked in three films with Sanjay
 main yah nahin kah rahaa hum ki main unka dost hum lekin main unhen jaanata hum
 i respect him and he respects me, so maybe he has chosen me to tell his story
 ’ apni baat puri karte hue hiraani ne kaha ki 'pichhali baar jab vah yahaan the tab maine unhen puri patakatha sunai thi
 He was aware of what was happening
 ’ Hirani, director of Three Idiots, believes that the only reason for me to make a film is an interesting story and nothing else
 main unki vaastavik jivan kii kahani se bahut prabhavit tha, maine sab kuch darkinar kar diya or sochaa ki yah vahi kahani he jisapar main film bananaa chahta hum
 'it is worth noting that Sanjay Dutt has seen many ups and downs in his life, from his alleged addiction to drugs to his involvement in the 1993 Mumbai serial bomb blasts

 The employees and other well-wishers of Sahara India Pariwar have been requested to contribute Rs

 It is a matter of being given shares
 sahaara samooh kaa daawa he ki uske 11 lakh vetanbhogi va field karmchaaree he
 This contribution has been appealed through a one-page letter issued with the signatures of the directors of the Society and the 'associates' of the group
 is bare main sampark kiye jane par sahaara ke adhikariyon ne spasht kiya ki yah patr subrat raay yaa prabandhan dwaara jari nahin kiya gaya he
 It is an emotional initiative of the people in view of the prevailing situation
 ek adhikari ne kaha ki yah nahin samajha janaa chahie ki sahaara samooh yaa prabandhan apane karmchaariyon se yogadan ke liye kah rahaa he
 Subrata Roy has formed this organization as a family

 Hopefully this feeling towards our main guardian will be understood

 The court has asked the group to first deposit Rs 10,000 crore for granting interim bail to Rai
 isamen 5,000 karod rupee bank guarantee ke rup main honge
 However, the group's lawyers told the court that it was difficult for the group to raise such a huge amount for the release of Subrata Roy and two other directors

 Advocates appearing for Roy and the group said that Justice KS Radhakrishnan and Justice JS Khehar told the bench that its stand was biased and the petition challenging this order should not be heard by this bench
 is diwali par swadeshi company mahindra apni nai bike Mojo 300 launch kar sakati he
 The concept of this powerful bike from Mahindra was introduced during the Delhi Auto Expo 2012
 haalanki 2012 ke baad se iske launch hone kii afvaahen lagaataar chalati raheen
 But after almost four years, Mahindra has now decided to launch it in the market
 is bike kii pre booking bhi shuru ho chuki he
 However, in a video released by Motorbeam, this bike looks quite different from the concept presented at the Auto Expo
 ummid kii ja rahi he ki deepawali tak yaa isse pehle yah bike bazaar main uplabdh hogi
 The bike has two headlamps, which also have daytime running lights
 is bike kii khaasiyat iskaa fork he jo aam bike se bilkul alag he
 This bike has an inverted fork, so its speedometer is digital and tachometer is analog
 This bike has a 296cc 4 stroke single cylinder engine which is liquid cooled
 is bike main aapako 6 speed transmishan milegaa
 However, the company has not yet disclosed its price
 namaskara main raveesh kumaar> gaanv kii panchayat main kabhi aapako rahane kaa avasar mila ho to aap behatar tareeke se aam aadmi party ke bheetar or baahar chal rahe masale ko samaj sakate hai

 However, the decision has not been made yet
 4 march kii kaaryakarini main mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke baithak main shaamil hone kii sambhaavna kam nazar aa rahi he
 Due to poor health, Arvind is going out of Delhi for ten days
 arvind ne twit kiya he ki party main jo kuch bhi chal rahaa he usase main bahut aahat hum
 i am not going to get into this dirty fight
 janata ke bharose ko kisi bhi haalat main nahin tuutane duungaa
 His tweet triggered speculation that Arvind had pronounced his decision
 agali battle yani gandi ladaai kehane ke baad log poochne lage hai ki tab arvind kyon nahin kuch kar rahe hai
 His tweet also did not clarify who he was hurt
 yogendra-prashanth ke bayanon se yaa ashutosh ashish or dilip ke bayanon se
 Along with running the government in the confidence of the public, it is also involved in how the leader performs the responsibility of his political leadership
 yah vivaad arvind kii jaan or imtahaan donon le rahaa he
 The only difference is that no new form has come before Arvind
 anna, kiran bedi, shazia ilmi ke saath medha patkar kaa alag hona bhale hi ai ai tii level kaa parchaa nahin tha lekin board ke level kaa to tha hi
 Prashant and Yogendra have leaked the letter, then who has leaked the letter of Dileep to Lokpal
 khud lokapal admiral ramdaus ne iconomik times main apni chitthee ke li hone kii baat likhi he
 In view of the increasing allegations of leaks, Lokpal should be accompanied by Lokpal in the Aam Aadmi Party
 likapal hi aadhikarik rup se chitthiyon ko li kare or sabase pehle mujhe li kare
 If possible, record my phone as well so that i can say that the Lokpal has not given it
 vaise patrkaar kaa sting or patrkaar kaa sorce bataanaa donon syrius maamla he
 There is some difference between what Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan are saying in the media and who are saying in the party
 kya is vajah se bhi pravaktaaon ke bayanon main katutaa ai he
 If this is the case then why did the spokesmen not make those same things public instead of speaking to the right
 aam aadmi party loktantric tareeke se raajnneetik mahatvakankshaon or asahmatiyon ko jagah nahin degi to yah dusron se alag kaise
 Having political ambitions is a normal and natural political act
 raajnneetik dal kii hi mahatvakanksha satta hoti he
 Lokpal Admiral Ramdas has endorsed Yogendra and Prashant's questions in the Economic Times on Tuesday, but has written that the post of co-convenor along with the national convenor should also be considered
 unhone yah bhi likhaa he ki kisi bhi jahaaz ko chalaane vaale navikon kaa dal badalata rahata he
 It is important to keep changing the crew of the Aam Aadmi Party
 lambii duuri kii yatra ke liye yah ek saamaanya prakriya bhi he
 In the end, it all depends on the captain that he will take out the ship from all the difficulties and bring it safely to the floor
 nau sena ke apane is anubhav ko admiral ramdaas ne aam aadmi ko taabeej kii tarah diya he
 The admiral should also pass judgment on the allegations that Prashant Bhushan and Dilip Pandey have submitted to him
 ve jin muddon se sahmati jataa rahe hai wo shaayad lokapal ke daayre main aata hi na ho
 It is another matter that no one has attacked Lokpal Ramdas for writing articles openly
 lekin, captain se ramdaas kii ummid bataa rahi he ki yah jhagada shaayad apane anjaam par nahin pahunchaa he
 As soon as you read Ashutosh and Ashish Khaitan's tweets, you feel that Yogendra and Prashant will have to go
 kisi ne inke twit ko lekar sawaal nahin kiya he ki vyaktigat hamale kyon ho rahe hai
 Ashish Khaitan has tweeted that Shanti, Shalini and Prashant want to make the party a party of father, son and daughter
 somvaar ko ashutosh ne kaha tha ki vaicharik ladaai he
 Not the person's
 mangalvaar ko twit kar kaha ki party main kashmir main janamat sangrah kii maang karne vaale ultra left or logon kii bhalaai ke liye vyaavhaarik raajnneeti karne waalon ke bich kaa takaraav he
 When the Prime Minister said Naxalite, AAP leaders and supporters attacked social media a lot
 kya ab ve khud bataa rahe hai ki unki party main ultra left he, jo kashmir main janamat sangrah kii baat kar rahaa he
 When you were criticized about this, then the AAP leaders kept away from Prashant and even followed along
 ab yah saaf nahin ki ultra left kii baat karne vaale sirf prashanth hai yaa prashanth ke saath yogendra bhi yaa prashanth or yogendra ke alaava kuch or log bhi hai
 Is this anger also because something other than what is being said is true
 is bich is vivaad ko nipataane ke liye aap ne teen sadasyon kii ek cameti bhi banaai he, jiske adhyaksh professor anand kumaar ne aaj hamaare sahyogi himanshu shekhar mishra ko bataaya ki unhone yogendra, prashanth or arvind se lambii baat kii he
 Especially after Shanti Bhushan said that Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav should support Kejriwal to be the convener
 ye teenon party kii ridh hai
 Professor Anand Kumar told Himanshu that the fork has gone out
 anand kumaar ko aisa nahin lagata ki maamla itnaa bighad gaya he ki sulajh nahin saktaa
 Yogendra Yadav said in prime time on Monday that he is not talking about any deadline regarding his questions
 unhone kabhi arvind ko hataane kii baat nahin kii he, balki kaaryakarini main unke istife kaa virodh kiya tha
 Yogendra praised Arvind's prodigious leadership
 kai logon ne kaha ki yogendra or prashanth peeche hat rahe hai
 But when the final decision is made
 lekin faisle se pehle kii jo saarvajanik prakriya aapnaai gai wo kis tarah se uchit he is par baat to ho hi sakati he
 After the debate can watch two movies
 aap to aise na the yaa aap jaisaa koi nahin

 Former Congress MP from Gwalior Ramsevak Singh has been fighting the same battle for 12 years, but now the hope of justice has been raised
 shanivaar ko unki shikaayat par dilli police ne exiaar darj kar lee

 In a reply, when the Lok Sabha Secretariat said that no fake questions were asked from 2004 to 2014, while sending a letter to Ramsevak Singh himself in 2005, the Secretariat itself had said that someone had made a false signature in his name
 tippaniyan Ramsevak says that he does not sign in Hindi, while the signature made with those questions was in Hindi

 With great difficulty, the police have registered a case after a year and started investigation

 The jamaat-ud-dawa chief visited the National Assembly Parliamentary constituency NA-120 for investigation in several areas
 yah seat pakistan kii raajnneeti main hai profile mana jaataa he kyonki purv pradhanmantri navaj sharif kaa yah sansadeey kshetra he or 1985 main raajnneeti main kadam rakhane ke baad vah ek baar bhi is seat se nahin haare

 The interior ministry has opposed the recognition of MML as a political party
 mantralay kaa kahana he ki suraksha ke lihaaj se ise raajnneetik dal ke rup main manyata nahin diya janaa chahie kyonki isse raajnneeti main hinsa or charampanth ko badhaava mil saktaa he

 The CBI has moved the High Court against returning some documents seized in the raid on the office of Principal Secretary of Delhi Government to Rajendra Kumar
 kumaar ke khilaaf bhrashtachar or aay se adhik sampatti arjeet karne se jude kai aarope hai
 The Patiala House Court, while giving the verdict on the petition of the Delhi government, had said that the documents seized from the office of the investigating agency Rajendra Kumar should return those documents which he does not require in connection with the investigation
 iske liye sibiai ko paanch din kaa samay diya gaya tha
 'CBI can only confiscate necessary documents', argued Delhi government lawyer Rahul Mehra
 Some of the unauthorized documents were also seized during the raid on December 15 last year, while the investigating agency can only seize necessary documents
 mehara kaa kahana tha ki sibiai ne june 2015 ke cabinet note sahit vibhinn dastavejon kii mul pratiyaan bhi jabt kar lee he
 Kejriwal had said- The Central conspiracy against me was raided by the CBI in December last year at Rajendra Kumar Kedftar in Delhi Secretariat

 So excited to start # veerediwedding @ reallyswara @ shikhatalsania # kareena @ rheakapoor # shashankghoshthis year has been amazing for me creatively
 Working on # padman , # duttbiopic and now ending it with # veerediwedding CSDS Director Sanjay Kumar said, "according to me, it is not right to think that there is a big crisis on the future of Congress due to Rahul Gandhi's resignation
 yah jarur he ki yah parampara ban gai thi ki gandhi parivaar kaa hi koi vyakti adhyaksh banegaa
 "he said," It is also not reasonable to assume that if someone outside the family becomes president, the party will end
 unke istife se shaayad party ko nayaa swaroop milane main madad mili
 He should remain active in the party
 aisa hone se unke ek lokapriy netaa taur par ubharne main madad mil sakati he
 "political analyst and Delhi University professor Sushila Ramaswamy said," There was an existential threat on the Congress and it had to get out of the control of the Gandhi family
 yah kahana uchit nahin hoga ki gandhi parivaar ke party kaa netritv nahin karne se congress nahin chal paaegi
 "however, he praised Rahul Gandhi for the steps he has taken to bring the party back to life

 The names of senior party leaders Sushil Kumar Shinde, Mallikarjun Kharge, Ashok Gehlot and Motilal Vora are among the potential candidates for the post of Congress president but it will be decided only after the CWC meeting
 party ke ek netaa ne kaha, "spasht netritv kii gaiyr maujuudagi main congress astitv ke sankat kaa saamana kar rahi he or aisi sthiti party ke liye thik nahin he, jise ki agle kuch maheene baad teen rajyon main vidhansabha chunaavon kaa saamana karnaa he
 "another Congress leader said that the party can remain united only under the leadership of the Gandhi family and if someone outside the family heads the party, this will increase disagreement
" chunavi haar kii naitik jimmedaari lete hue gandhi ne congress kaary samiti (seedblusi) ko yah suzav bhi diya ki nayaa adhyaksh chunane ke liye ek samooh gathit kiya jaae kyonki unke liye yah upyukt nahin he ki vah is prakriya main shaamil hon
 Between Friday night and Saturday night, 9 newborns have been stirred up in Ahmedabad's Civil Hospital in Gujarat

 Congress leader Shakti Singh Gohil tweeted that the Gujarat government should accept accountability for this
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar yaa to yah sweekaar kare ki doctoron ne laaparvaahee kii yaa to yah maane ki unki maatayen kuposhit thim
 Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia said that he is deeply saddened to hear the news of 9 children in one day, this incident highlights the careless and lethargic attitude about the health of the government

 On the day of the postponement of Nitish's election as the leader of jdu's Legislature Party by the Patna High Court, the former Chief Minister told reporters after meeting the President that the delay caused by the Governor was "deteriorating"
 And the 'horse-trading' of mlas is being encouraged
 raashtrapati se nitish kii bhent ke dauraan jadyu adhyaksh sharad yadav, rajd netaa lalu prasad yadav, sapa pramukh mulaayam singh yadav or congress netaa seepi joshi bhi maujuud the
 Contrary to the demand to invite him to form the government, Nitish said that if Governor Kesharinath Tripathi wants to, he can ask Manjhi to prove his majority
 lekin iske liye mukhyamantri ko kam se kam vakt diya janaa chahie
 Among the 130 legislators supporting Nitish Kumar, 99 are from the JD (U), 24 from the RJD, five from the Congress, one from the Communist Party of India (CPI) and one Independent
 243 sadasyeey bihar vidhansabha main vartmaan samay main 10 seat rikt he
 a total of 117 mlas are required to prove a majority

 Earlier, while speaking to journalists at Patna Airport on Tuesday in order to go to Delhi, Nitish said, "more than 24 hours have elapsed since meeting the Governor and claiming to form the government, but so far the Governor has not taken any decision 
 rajyapal kaa vilamb maahaul pradooshit kar rahaa he
 Now the mlas are going to the President
 " Here, the supporters of Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi are also involved in manipulations
 maanjhi samarthak vidhayak khulkar to kuch nahin bol rahe, lekin unka kahana he ki vidhansabha main bahumat sabit karenge
 Meanwhile, in the meeting of the Bihar Council of Ministers chaired by the Chief Minister on Tuesday, 23 proposals were approved

 It is noteworthy that Nitish reached Raj Bhavan on Monday on foot marching with 130 mlas and claimed to meet Governor Kesharinath Tripathi to form the government
 idhar, mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ne bhi somvaar ko rajyapal se milakar bahumat sabit karne kii baat kahi thi
 Manjhi, who refused to step down as the chief minister, was expelled from the party by the JD (U) national president for his involvement in anti-party activities

 Earlier in 1986, Javed Miandad did this feat against India in Sharjah
 or ab karthik ne 32 saal baad miyandad ke us bahucharchit chakke ko feekaa kar dikhaaya
 Indeed, Miandad needed 4 runs to win at the time
 aise main unke paas do vikalp the- aakhri gend par chaukaa lagaaein yaa phir chakka! aakhirkaar unhone chetan sharma kii gend par chakka jadkar australesia cap par kabja kar liya
 Here, Karthik faced the challenge of scoring 5 runs to win the last ball
 aise main chakka hi 'ekmaatr upaay' tha
 What was then, Karthik snatched the opportunity to celebrate from Bangladesh by bouncing the ball of Soumya Sarkar on the extra cover
 aakhri over : karthik ne aisi been bajaai ki bangladesh bhuulaa nagin dancegauratlab he ki bharat ko aakhir main 12 gendon par jeet ke liye 34 ranon kii jarurat thi
 In such a situation, Dinesh Karthik stepped on the crease

 In the Hit and Run case, the Sessions court of Mumbai has framed charges against Bollywood's overbearing Salman Khan for culpable homicide
 agar ve doshi paae gaye to unhen 10 saal kii sajaa ho sakati he
 It is a matter of relief for them that they have been exempted from trial during the trial
 is maamle kii agali sunwaayee 19 agast ko hogi
 During the hearing, Salman Khan tried to prove himself innocent
 jaj ne unase poocha ki kya ve khud ko is maamle main doshi maanate hai to unhone kaha, 'main nirdosh hum
 'but the court decided that he would be charged with culpable homicide and charges were framed against him under sections 304 (2) (non-culpable homicide), 379 (negligence), 338 and 437 of IPC
 court ne salmaan khan ko thodi raahat dete hue unhen trial ke dauraan peshi se chhot bhi de di
 But the judge has said that when necessary, he will have to appear in court
 haalanki isse pehle jaj ne kaha tha ki vah sunwaayee nahin kar sakate kyonki unka tabadalaa ho gaya he
 But Salman's lawyer said that his client has to go abroad for shooting in September, so he should be allowed to appear in court in private
 is par sarkari vakil ne kaha ki aaropee kii gaiyr-maujuudagi main aarope tay nahin ho sakate
 After listening to the two lawyers, the judge agreed to the hearing
 iske baad jaj ne salmaan ko raahat dete hue unhen trial ke dauraan nijee taur par peshi se chhot de di
 Salman reached the court at 11 am and his two sisters Alvira and Arpita were also with him
 salmaan kaaphi nervas dikhaae de rahe the or gaadi main raste bhar unhone kisi se koi baat nahin kii
 The trial of this case started on 19 July last week and even then Salman was present in court in private
 court ne unhen duusari sunwaayee par bhi hajir rahane kaa aadesh diya tha
 During the hearing last week, Salman sat in the courtroom instead of the general public, but the judge told him that he was an accused, so he would have to sit in the place of the accused
 jaj ke aadesh ke baad salmaan ko apni jagah badalani padi thi
 Earlier on 25 June, the Sessions court of Mumbai dismissed Salman's reconsideration petition in the 2002 hit and run case and said that a case of culpable homicide would run against him

 Although the Intelligence Bureau (IB) investigation on this security lapse raised many questions, this serious case of missile disappearance in March was made by the then Defense Minister A
K
 ke
 Suppressed at the behest of Antony
 ab nai sarkaar is maamle ko gambhirtha se lete hue nae sire se puri prakriya kii jaanch karaane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 When India Today reached to take Antony's response in this matter, his reply was, "I cannot comment on such serious matters without any preparation and in haste
" is maamle se jude sabhi tathy maujuuda sarkaar ke paas hai or maamle se judi koi poochtacha bhi sarkaar se hi honi chahie
 i no longer have access to those facts
 ’’is maamle par faili bechaini ko is tathy se bhi samajha ja saktaa he ki ‘‘pragati’’ ko pakistan kii tactical newclear missile ke jawaab main taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 Through its tactical nuclear missile, Pakistan wanted to change the strategic balance of the subcontinent, which has been in India's favor because of its traditional strength
 paramparaagat lambii duuri vaali mixilon (jo kisi shahar ke bade hisson ko safaya karne kii kshamta rakhti hai) kii tarah na hokar ye tactical misile choti duuri kii, nishaanaa badalane main aasaan or simit duuri ke lakshyon ko bahut sateek nishaanaa banane kii kshamta rakhti hai
 These missiles can be eradicated from the tank manufacturing sites and the enemy troops marching
 kul milakar pakistan kii ore se yah bharat ke paramparaagat sainya hamale kaa ek chote or sateek parmaanu hamale se jawaab dene kii taiyaari thi
 Launched last year, the new Nasr missile was called a "weapon of peace" by the Pakistani Atomic Force Chief and was introduced as a missile that changed modalities
 yah dikhaane kii koshish kii gai ki is missile ke jariye dushman ke sainya hamalon kaa jawaab diya ja saktaa he or aisa karte hue bade hathiyaaron se hone vaali baari tabaahi or hajaaron masuumon kii jaan ke kalank se bachaa ja saktaa he
 India gave a two-pronged response to this Pakistan effort
 sabase pehle rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar parishad ke adhyaksh shyaam saran se yah sanket dilvaaya ki parmaanu hathiyaaron kaa kisi bhi rup main istemaal ‘‘no first yuj policy’’ kaa ulanghan mana jayega or antat aisi koshish baari javaabi karrwai kaa aamantran hogi
 On the other hand, India gave a more practical answer to this by creating its own tactical missile "prahar" on the lines of Pakistan which could give a befitting reply to Pakistan's limited attacks
 isi vajah se pragati (prahaar kaa niryaat kiya jane vaala rup) ko pichley saal 29 aktubar ko dakshin korea main shuru hui ‘‘adex tseol dephence pradarshnee’’ main bheja gaya
 It was capable of carrying 200 kg of warheads for a distance of 60–170 km
 ise bharat kii pehali peedi kii newclear missile prithvi kii jagah lene ke liye banaaya gaya tha
 The rules for sending sensitive weapons to such exhibitions are that a dummy of the weapon be prepared and sent by ship
 lekin pradarshkon-dephence research and deveopment orgenigeshan (diardio) or menuphacturer bharat dynamiks limited (bidiel) ne behad gaiyr-samvedansheel or ajeebogareeb vajahon kaa hawala dete hue pareekshan ke liye taiyaar or puri tarah se ‘‘karyrat’’ prototip ko pradarshnee main bhej diya
 This decision had to be approved by Antony himself
 lekin ajeeb ghatnaon kii puri kadi kaa vivaran ibi kii report main miltaa he
 According to this report, after the exhibition was over on November 3, the exhibitors failed to encase the missile and because of this the missile could not be loaded into the ship on the scheduled date from which it was to return to India
 lagbhag ek maheene tak missile bagaiyr kisi kii jaankaree or kisi duusare intjaam ke intjaar main bandargah par padi rahi
 Even when rearranged, the missile had to be brought to India via a general merchant cargo ship
 bich main china ke bandargah par jahaaj ko paramparaagat vajahon se ruknaa padaa
 Here, one could easily know about the technology of this missile
 missile ke deree se lautne kii vajah se hafton tak vikaas projects kaa kaam thap rahaa or saal ke ant main missile ke videshi jameen par pade rahane kii khabar jab tseol se chalati hui ibi tak pahunchi to is puure maamle par jaanch kii ghoshnaa hui
 As the investigation progressed in the coming months, the IB found that the missile was sent abroad in violation of the rules and the decision was a major security risk
 ibi ne raksha mantralay se sambandhit maamle main javabdehi tay karne ko bhi kaha
 The Intelligence Department also questioned the security carelessness of the missile handling method and the highly sensitive matter such as the missile project
 farvari main raksha mantri ke paas bheji gai report main south korea main missile kii dekharekh kii jimmedaari ke liye pradarshkon ke chini agent kii bhoomika par bhi sawaal uthaae gaye
 The report also drew attention to the impact on the missile project due to the delay in sending the missile via the ship on time
 tseol se lautne ke kuch maheenon baad missile ke prototip kaa pareekshan hona tay tha
 In the final weeks of his term, Defense Minister A
 ke
 Antony closed the case and suppressed the IB report
 vishwasaneey sutron se pataa chalata he ki antni ne rukhi tippanee ke saath report ko khaarij kar diya
 In an official note on March 13, in response to the IB taking information about the action taken on the entire matter, it simply wrote - "in the future proper precautions should be taken
 ’’apane bachaav main menuphacturer bidiel ne ibi ko bataaya ki prototip ko bhejne kii anumati khud raksha mantri or videsh mantri ne di thi
 The DRDO specifically wrote about the progress of the Pragati missile, seeking permission to send "pragati" and the medium-range ground-to-sky Akash missile to Seoul
 haalanki puure maamle main sharmasaar hone or ibi kii report aane ke baad raksha mantri ne bhavishya main aise samvedansheel hathiyaaron ko videsh nahin bhejne ke aadesh jari kiye, lekin is puure maamle main abhi tak kisi kii javabdehi tay nahin kii gai he
 Now that the government is looking at the matter afresh, the focus of the top leadership has shifted to action
 abhi saaf nahin he ki upie sarkaar ke antim dinon main band ho jane ke baad is maamle par modi sarkaar kya kadam uthaaegi
 Very little information is available about what the missile technology revealed amid the delay in returning to India
 yahaan tak ki ibi bhi is bare main koi jaankaree nahin juta paaya

 Amid the ongoing political uproar over sealing, the Aam Aadmi Party government has sent a file to notify LG Anil Baijal to notify 351 roads in Delhi

 Soon after sending the file to the LG office, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted, "as soon as this file is passed from the Lt
 Governor's office, the Delhi government will send the file to the Supreme Court without delay so that these 351 roads are as soon as possible
" To be brought within the scope of the notification '
 Within one hour of the file pertaining to change of land use of 351 roads, which was pending since 2006 with mcds, being put upto Urban Development minister@satyendarjain, the minister has recommended the file for lg's approval
 Minister was constantly following it with mcds — Nagendar Sharma (@sharmanagendar) February 7, 2018 On Wednesday, 36 Aam Aadmi Party mlas also suggested to the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to expedite the sealing
 'aap' vidhayak or didie sadsy somnath bharti ke mutabik ‘ceiling kaa sara samaadhaan dilli ke master plan main maujuud he

 gupta ne is masale par aam aadmi party ko dilli kii janata se maafee maangane ko kaha he
 According to Vijender Gupta, 'AAP' deliberately delayed the case so that traders could be instigated against the BJP
