 9 / 11 ko anjaam dene vaale 19 main se 15 aatanki saudi arab ke hi the
 So who should America attack? But in the entire Arab world today, if America has the most trusted partner then it is Saudi Arabia
 america khufia agenciyon ke mutabik aaj bhi duniya ke aatanki sanghathanon ko sabase zyada funding saudi arab ke logon or vahaan kii kuch sansthaaon se ho rahi he, lekin america he ki use aatank ke khilaaf ladaai main apana sabase bada saajhedaar bataata he
 What is the secret of this friendship-friendship: with America
 
 
 -saudi arab or america kii ghanishthata sheet yuddh ke samay se he
 Saudi Arabia had termed Communist ideology as anti-islam
 aise main jab afghanistan se rus ko dhakelne kii baat ai to saudi arab ne america kii bharpoor madad kii
 Since that period, the US military base is in Saudi Arabia
 -9 / 11 hamale main saudi nagarikon ke shaamil hone kii baat ai to vahaan kii sarkaar ne bina anakani kiye karrwai kii
 America's confidence increased
 -2003 main aatankiyon ne saudi arab kii rajdhani riyaad ke us ilaake main dhamaake kiye, jahaan zyaadaatar videshi rahete the
 Since that incident, there have been strict campaigns against terrorists in this Arab country
 -arab deshon main america kaa sabase bada bijness saudi arab se hi hota he
 He gives cheap petroleum to the US and imports many other products
 funding: aatankiyon ke paksh main
 
 
 In 2005, the US Treasury Department official gave a statement in front of Congress that for the last 25 years many charity institutions receiving grants from the Saudi government have been helping those who promote terrorism in different parts of the world
 
 -2003 main state department ke purv adhikari ne congress ke samaksh bayaan diya ki saudi arab kii charity sanstha al-harman islamic foundation ne misr ke aatanki sanghathan gamma al-islamia kii funding kii
 - In May 2004, the same former State Department official also said that the International Islamic Relief Organization and the World Muslim League, two of Saudi Arabia's largest charities, are supporting Islamic terrorist organizations around the world
 -saudi cheritable community kaa ek shaks vail hamaja julydan ke bare main bataaya gaya ki vah alqaida se jude kai aatankiyon kii madad karata he
 Especially terrorists who are active in southern Europe
 -itnaa hi nahin, 9 / 11 kamishan kii jaanch report ke mutabik alqaida ne apane karnaamon ko anjaam dene ke liye kai saudi logon or charity sansthaaon se paise or anya tarah se madad lee
 However, despite many such cases, the commission could not gather any evidence whether the government there was aware about the Saudi help given to the terrorists
 saudi arab kii jad main he kattartasaudi arab hi duniya kaa vah ekmaatr desh he, jo jehad ke dam par bana he
 In 1932, Abdul Aziz al-saud, a tribal chief, captured a large part and declared it as a country in his own name
 apni satta ko majbootee dene ke liye usne ilaake ke asardaar logon (wahabiyon) ko saath liya
 Wahhabis were fundamentalist Islamic beliefs
 is tarah saudi arab main ek kattar islamic kanoonon vaali hukumat ne kaam karnaa shuru kiya
 Petroleum money and the importance of maize Petroleum was discovered in Saudi Arabia in the 1950s
 60 or 70 ke dashak main to isaki badaulat paisa barasane laga
 But the Wahhabis wanted Islamic fundamentalism in the country
 1965 main wahabiyon ne desh main lagi sabhi tasveeron ko todphod kar hataa diya
 Quoting the argument that photographs are not justified in Islam
 wahabiyon ne saudi badshaah kii tasviren bhi hataa deen
 There was so much conflict between the police and Wahhabis that King Faisal of Saudi was killed in it
 haalanki iske baad bhi maamla shant nahin hua
 In 1979, a group of Wahhabis attacked Mecca during the Hajj and took possession of the holy mosque
 kareeb do saptaah vahaan sangharsh chalaa or kai logon kii jaan gai
 Since then, the Saudi government has never allowed the control of this holy place to weaken
 badshahath bhi bachi rahe or rutaba bhi badhata raheus daur main jabaki puure arab main taanaashaahee ke khilaaf or loktantr ke samarthan main andolan ho rahe the, vahaan saudi arab kii badshahath kaayam rahi
 Arab countries such as Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Palestine, Sudan were in turmoil, but there was no response from Saudi Arabia

 'though the lyrics, mood and atmosphere of Adi songs are different, but they all have one thing in common that they have been groomed by Manna Dey, the most melodious singer of Indian film music
 2005 main padam vibhushan se sammanit hue the manna dekai rashtriya puraskaron, rajya sarkaron ke sammaan or shreshth gayak ke dheron puraskaron se sammanit manna de ko 1971 main padam shri or 2005 main padam vibhushan se alankrita kiya gaya
 In view of his contribution to music, he has been announced to receive the Dadasaheb Phalke Award for the year 2007
 'tamanna' pehali film thimenna de ne 1943 main 'tamanna' film main pehali baar parshvagayak ke taur par apni aawaaj di or uske baad vah dhire dhire hindi film sangeet ke ek thos stambh banate chale gaye
 The 1950s to 1970s is called the Golden Age of Hindi film music and Manna Dey's golden voice contributed greatly to making it a golden one
 unhone mohammad rafee, kishor kumaar or mukesh ke saath milakar bhartiya film sangeet kii ek majboot neenv rakhi
 The music of any film was considered incomplete without the prized voice of these four, and even in these, Manna Dey is said to be a master of classical music
 pahalwani or mukkebaaji ke shaukeen rahe hai manna deek may 1919 ko pooran chandra or mahamaya de ke yahaan janme prabodh chandra de ko aap or ham manna de ke naam se jaanate hai
 Very few people will know that Manna Dey used to enjoy wrestling and boxing as a child
 kahaan raf taff pahalawaanon kaa akkhad mizaaj or kahaan gayaki ke maheen sur, dono main kahin koi samanta nahin, lekin manna de ne in donon main behtareen tareeke se talmail bithaaya
 Manna Dey often sang at the request of her classmates during the Scottish Church College days
 unke chachaa sangitacharya ke si de ne bahut chhutpan main hi unhen sangeet kii baarikiyon se avgat karaayaa or unki mithi aawaaj ne unhen har geet ko chaashni bana dene kaa hunar bakhsha
 In 1942, Manna Dey has also been an assistant to SD Burman, went to his uncle in Mumbai and started working as his assistant there
 kuch samay tak vah sachin dev burman ke sahaayak rahe or baad main kuch anya sangeet nirdeshkon ke saath bhi kaam kiya
 During this he continued to learn the nuances of singing from Ustad Aman Ali Khan and Ustad Abdal Rahman Khan
 suraiya ke saath yugal geet safal rahi thiunhone 1943 main 'tamanna' film main suraiya ke saath yugal geet gaaya
 The song was a huge success and his stoic puritan voice was well received
 iske baad unhone 'ram rajya', 'kavita', 'mahakavi', 'vikramaditya', 'prabhu kaa ghar', 'valmiki' or 'geet govind' jaisi filmon ke liye apni aawaaj di
 In those days films were very less, so he was able to sing only in a film in a year
 raaj kapur ke liye bhi gaae hai manna de50 ke dashak tak manna de ek manze hue parshvagayak ke taur par sthapit ho gaye or unhone 'aawaara', 'do bigha jameen', 'hamdard', 'parinita', 'chitrangada', 'boot paalish' or 'shri 420' jaisi filmon ke liye parshvagayan kiya
 Mukesh usually gave his voice in Raj Kapoor films, but Raj Kapoor relied on Manna Dey's voice for some songs
 shri 420 kaa 'mud mud ke na dekh, mud mud ke
 
 
 ',' My name is Joker ',' a brother, just look
 
 
 ' or 'bobi' film kaa 'naa maangu sona chaandi
 
 
 'adi is some such songs
 bhim sen joshi ke saath bhi geet gaae hanmanna de kii aawaaj har daur main pasand kii gai
 He has composed songs from various films like 'sholay', 'unclaimed', 'satyam Shivam Sundaram', 'choron Ki Baaraat', 'kranti', 'karj', 'saudagar', 'hindustan Ki Kasam', 'budha Mil Gaya' Gave the voice
 unhone desh ke mahaan shastreey gayakon main shumaar bhimsen joshi ke saath 'ketki gulab juhi, chanpak ban foole
 
 
 'introduced his spiritual practice by singing
 unhen rabindra sangeet kaa bhi chitera mana jaataa tha or unhone 3500 se adhik geet gaae
 The National Award has been received before the Manna Dey Kodada Saheb Phalke Award, in which Manna Dey was awarded the National Award for the film 'mere Huzoor' in 1969 and the Bengali film 'nishi Padma' in 1971
 madhya pradesh sarkaar ne unhen 1985 main lata mangeshkar puraskaar diya

 Rajiv Dhawan said that the deity must be created as if the idol should also be consecrated

 kuch yahi hakeekat he mokshanagari varanasi main ganga ke ghaaton kii
 Four years ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi started the Namami Gange Mission from Assi Ghat in Varanasi
 modi saansad ke naate loksabhaa main varanasi kii hi numaaindgi karte hai
 Crores of rupees have been spent in the last four years in the name of cleaning the Ganga, but the reality is that plastic, skeletons and garbage can be seen scattered everywhere in the Ganges
 ise bhi padhein-modi@4: uma gayi-gadakari aae, ghaaton kii safai tak simata nirmal ganga kaa sapana4 saal main nahin badali maili gangaindia today ne ground jiro par jaakar jayja liya ki ganga beete chaar saal main kitni svachh hui yaa nahin hui
 It is difficult to describe in words the disgrace of the Ganges near Assi Ghat
 yahaan lakhon litre sivej kaa pani har din ganga se aakar miltaa he
 The smell that arises here is out of tolerance
 yahaan naak par rumal rakhe bina thodi der bhi khadaa nahin hua ja saktaa
 Piles of garbage and dirt coming out of homes can be seen at Assi Ghat
 india today nesvachh gangaaresearch leboratory (SGRL) se jude rakesh pandey ke jariye ganga ke pani kii gunvattta kaa test karne kii koshish kii
 Preliminary examination of a sample of Ganges water taken from Assi Ghat revealed that it has 150 times more germs and bacteria than mineral water
 varanasi main sthiti abhi bhi chintajanakvaranasi ke malviya brij ke paas ek or naala shahar ke tamaam kooday karkat ke saath ganga main miltaa he
 Seeing the floating skeletons of dead flora and fauna here makes the eyes very dull
 taelianala ghat par farsh or deevaaren dhansi saaf dekhi ja sakati he
 Needs immediate repair here
 ghat kaa ek bada hissaa koodayghar main tabdeel ho chukaa he
 The ghat is being used to throw household waste
 yahaan kachra phenkane se rokane ke liye kisi tarah ke pukhta intjaam nahin he
 Talking on the 'namami Gange Mission', the locals of Telianala Ghat raised many questions
 ek sthaneey ne india today se kaha, 'nadi kaa pani zyada pradooshit or ganda ho gaya he
 Open drains are a big problem
 ghaaton kii sahi tareeke se saaf safai nahin kii jaati
 The India Today team also reached Assi Ghat from where Prime Minister Modi started the campaign to clean the Ganges
 assi ghat par thik usee jagah par shahar se ek chota naala ganga main milte dikhaai diya
 This ghat also did not remain untouched by the spread of garbage
 yahaan log phool, pani kii bottlen or anya saamaan ganga main bahaate dikhe
 Situation of inaction on awareness, India Today spoke to the students of Parbansarahindhu University, their different opinions came out
 kuch chaatro kaa kahana tha ki ganga kii safai ke liye samuchit upaay nahin kiye gaye
 At the same time some students were seen saying that in the last few years, the situation has become better
 biechayu ke ek chaatr ne kataaksh karte hue kaha, 'ab ham hari ganga dekh sakate hai
 This is because drains and dirt have changed the color of the water
 ghaaton kii haalat badtar hoti ja rahi he
 'india Today also reached Dashashwamedh Ghat to know the ground reality
 yahaan har din hajaaron log punya kamaane kii aas main ganga main dubkee lagane aate hai
 Here also the water of Ganga Ganga appeared quite polluted
 yahaan bhi nadi kaa istemaal jagah-jagah kachra phenkane ke liye istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 No employees of the district administration were seen cleaning the entire Danshwamedh Ghat
 naa hi yahaan ganga mishan team se judaa koi sadsy logon main swatchta ke liye jaagrukta failaata dikhaa
 The report taken on June 22 of the quality of Ganganadi water not worth bathing is surprising
 svachh ganga research leboratory (SGRL) kii ore se chaar pramukh ghaaton se ganga ke pani ke namoonay liye gaye
 The aim was to check the quality of the water to see how suitable it was for bathing
 lab ke mutabik report se saamne aayaa ki fical coliform count (bacteria kii maujuudagi) jo ki nadi ke pani main prati 100 millilitre 500 se zyada nahin hona chahie wo assi ghat par 1,40,000, tulsi ghat par 88,000, dashashwamedh ghat par 40,000 or rajghat par 34,000 paaya gaya
 Talking about Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) on Ganges water, it should not exceed 5 mg per liter of water
 lekin ye BOD assi ghat par 12

 Not a proper plan for cleanliness, Professor VK Mishra, Director of Clean Ganga Research Lab, says, "there is no proper plan for cleaning Ganges river and ghats
 nadi ko tab tak saaf nahin kiya ja saktaa jab tak ki naalon kaa ganda pani isamen milanaa roka nahin jaataa
 'the main problem of Varanasi is that the drains meet here in the river, the ghats have been made garbage
 isi tarah kanpur main naalon ne ganga ko hi 'naala' bana diya he
 Kanpur was once called the 'manchester of Asia', but in the last few years, the quality of the climate of the city and the water of the Ganges has fallen significantly
 ganga ke pani ko pradooshit karne ke liye kanpur ke chamada kaarkaane se nikalne vaale kachare ko sabase zyada jimmedaar mana jaataa he
 Many leather factories have been closed in the Jajmau area of malikanpur, which is being ganged up in Kanpur by the leather factory, but many leather factories are still operating in the city
 ek naale ke jariye lakhon litre ganda pani har din ganga main miltaa he
 According to Municipal Commissioner Santosh Kumar Sharma, industrial waste from leather factories and garbage from houses are being found in the Ganges through the drain
 sharma ne kaha, 'donon tarah ke kachare ko chhaantane kii prakriya hamaari ore se shuru kii gai he jisase ki usee ke mutabik treet kiya ja sake
 'it is unfortunate that even after spending hundreds of crores of rupees, the Ganges and Ghats in Kanpur have not been cleaned
 kanpur ke paas hi paramat kshetra main ek naale kaa ganda pani ganga main girtaa he
 Here the quality of water is very poor, it can be estimated from this that as soon as the water is taken in the palm, it starts scratching in the palm
 india today team kaint kshetra main bhi ek ghat par pahunchi
 Here the Ganges appeared dry, but the dirty water of a drain containing the waste of the surrounding area was definitely seen falling

 ) Film Name: Baywatch Director: Seth Jordanstar Cast: Dwayne Johnson, Zac Efron, Priyanka Chopra, Alexandra, John Bass, David Hesselaf Duration: 1 hour 57 minutes Certificates: a Rating: 2 Star When the 'baywatch' serial came out in the 90s There was also a special way of looking at the Indian audience
 david or pamela kii maujuudagi us serial kii jaan hua karti thi jise dekhte-dekhte 90 ke dashak ke bachche ab bade ho chuke hai
 Now, almost 16 years later, the film 'baywatch' has been made on the theme of the same serial
 priyanka kaa khulaasa-pahenti hai ex-boyfriend kii jacket, maangane par bhi nahin lautiie jaane, tivi sho par bani ye film box offis par kitna kamaal dikhaaegi
 
 
 Story This story is from the Baywatch team on the seashore of Florida, headed by Mitch (dwayne Johnson)
 ek baar city council ne mitch ke team main mat bradi (jaik affraan) kii niyukti kii jisase mitch naa khush the kyonki mat apane kaam main laaparvaahee baratate aae hai
 But the twist in the story comes when bags of drugs are found near the middle and the needle of Mitch's suspicion stops atop Victoria Leeds (priyanka Chopra)
 ab kis tarah se mitch or uski puri team is shadyantr kaa pardaafash karti he yahi is film main dikhaaya gaya he

 - The actors in the film are very good but sometimes it happens that you have more than one player but due to the script the score is very low
 kuch aisa hi is film ke saath bhi he
 Despite being a great starcast, the story was defeated
 'bewaach' kaa doosraa trailor relies, priyanka chopra kaa jalawaa barkaraar- kuch sikvence aise bhi aate hai jinhen dekhakar lagata he ki shaayad jabardastee unhen rakhaa gaya he
 - Fans of English films who were expecting a lot from this film, unfortunately they will not get all that
 kyon dekh sakate hai ye filofilm main aapke pasandida actor jaise dwen johnson, priyanka chopra, jaik effron kii maujuudagi film ko kaaphi rich banaati he
 Also interesting are the action sequences and select scenes that act as a visual treat
 box offisfilm kaa bajet bahut zyada he or bade-bade star kii maujuudagi fees ke lihaaj se ise or badhaati he
 Although Dwayne Johnson is also associated with this film as a producer, his efforts may be less

 This study says that in the year 2100, the number of dead users on Facebook 4
 9 billian ho jaaegi
 However, a Facebook spokesperson for the Oxford Internet Institute study told TIME that they did not agree with the study's prediction
 unhone kaha he ki company digital legasy banane ko lekar gambhir he
 He has also said since TIME, 'facebook has taken many majors to handle the user's death
 ek baar company ko yugers ke deth kii jaankaree milti he to unke acount ko special memorial style pej main tabdeel kar diya jaataa he
 Facebook has millions of such memorialized accounts
 It is important that Facebook has an option in its settings
 yahaan ja kar yugers legacy contact select kar sakate hai
 By doing this, after the death of the users, he gets access to the account which the user has added to the legacy contact
 iske baad wo acount memorialized ho jaataa he

 christmas or uphaar, yani doguna anand
 Christmas is celebrated on 25 December, and exactly a month before, on 25 November, Shopping Reminder Day is celebrated in some countries to remind people to buy gifts for Christmas
 ek maah kaa samay uphaaron kii kharid or christmas kii taiyaari ke liye paryaapt hota he
 Alphonso Joseph, a nurse in a government hospital, says, "at Christmas we give each other presents
 jaldbaaji main uphaar kharid paanaa mushkil hota he, isliye meri koshish hoti he ki thodaa pehle hi bazaar ja kar uphaar kharid luun
 "the festival itself has many joys," says Alphonso

 christmas par vah uphaar raat ko main un jagahon par rakh detii hum, jahaan mujhe lagata he ki subah uthakar bachche sabase pehle dekhenge
 The children become happy when they see the gift in the morning
 ’’vah kahati hai ‘‘ab to bachche bade ho gaye hai

 Children used to be happy

 Give gifts when you want, but there is something else about giving gifts on festivals

 com / zxdu8k9eyz ye ek aisi kadavi sachai he ki bihar bijepi ho yaa bijepi ke kendriya netaa, sab ab maanakar chal rahe hai ki agar bihar main mukhyamantri ke liye kisi netaa ko pesh karne kaa faisla kiya gaya, to party kii pasand susheel modi hi honge
 If the Assembly elections were fought in the name of PM Narendra Modi and the majority figure is found in the state, then in that situation also the Chief Minister will be Sushil Modi
 party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah mangalvaar ko patna main kaaryakartaaon ke ek sammelan ko sambodhit karenge or mana ja rahaa he ki bihar vidhansabha chunavon ke liye chunavi abhiyaan kaa shriganesh karenge
 Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and all BJP leaders in the Union Cabinet from Bihar will be present in this conference
 lekin sawaal he ki kya amit shah us netaa yaa kahie susheel modi ke naam kii ghoshnaa mukhyamantri pad ke umidavaar ke rup main karenge?party ke netaaon kii maane, to shah is baat kii ghoshnaa karen yaa na karen, lekin mukhyamantri pad ke liye susheel modi ko filhal chunauti dene vaale sabhi netaa alag-thalag pad gaye hai
 There are many things in favor of Sushil Modi
 bhale hi bihar bijepi main agadi jati ke kai netaa unke naam kaa virodh karte hon, lekin yah sach he ki kendriya netritv ke liye modi jitna prabhavi koi netaa nahin he, jiskaa pramaan he ki party ke har kaarykram main wo sabase antim main bolne vaale netaa hote hai
 Last week when the Union Finance Minister convened a meeting of all cabinet ministers from Bihar and other Union ministers to discuss the package for Bihar, Sushil Modi was specially called from Patna
 vidhansabha satr ke dauraan vidhaan mandal dal ke netaa ke rup main har hafte susheel modi na keval baithak bulaate hai, balki jithan ram maanjhi ke saath party ko kitne dur tak janaa he, kitni najdiki rakhni he or kitni duuri rakhni he, sab modi kii ranneeti ke anusaar hua
 Even the staunch opponents of Sushil Modi in the party believe that the amount of time Modi gives for the party, the other leaders of his opponents do not give together
 rajya main jab bhi koi ghatana hoti he, agle din modi us jagah yaa prabhavit logon se milane main deree nahin karte
 Due to the election year, who is to be included in the party, unless Modi gives his consent, his meeting is not held
 haalanki party ke netaaon kaa akalan he ki modi ke naam kii ghoshnaa ho jane par laabh se zyada nuksaan bhi ho saktaa he
 Nitish still remains the first choice among the common people due to his work
 modi ke prati na keval agadi jati ke party ke netaa, balki agadi jati ke voter bhi party se bidak sakate hai
 But at present, if all the leaders who are opposed to Modi and who aspire to the post of Chief Minister, are also united, then they cannot prove to be twenty to face Modi
 modi ke saath sabase badi baat yah rahi he ki vah bihar main 9 varshon tak lalu yadav ke samay vipaksh ke netaa rahe or jamkar lalu sarkaar se muqabla kiya
 In the Nitish cabinet too, the party made him Deputy Chief Minister, then during his tenure, he was known for his work more than controversies
 pichley do varshon main jab se nitish kumaar se sambandh toote, shaayad hi koi aisa din rahaa ho, jab unhone nitish sarkaar kii aalochana main shabdon kii talwaar nahin chalaai ho
 For all these reasons, the party has no option left in Bihar except for the slogan 'modi above, Modi below'

 There was positive feeling while shooting
 aashiqui-2 kii script main kya pasand aayaa tha?rahul jayakar kaa role chalanging tha
 If the character was a bit complex then i thought it would be challenging
 phir mohit suri jaisaa diarector hona bhi script ko dam detaa he
 Now that the film has been successful, what kind of response is it from the fans? i often use a bike to avoid traffic
 aajkal jab bhi main bike se nikalataa hum to do-teen bikes mujhe gher leti hai or film yaa uske gane ko lekar baaten karne lagati hai
 Will Solo do films even now? Absolutely
 lekin iske saath hi mujhe acchhee filmein bhi kerani hai
 To grow as an actor
 script chunate samay kis baat kaa khaas khyaal rakhte hai?acchhee kahani or diarector kyonki film relies to ek din main ho jaati he lekin uski shooting main chah maheene tak lag jate hai
 So he should spend six months working in fun
 aapke donon bhai (siddharth roy kapur or kunal roy kapur) or bhabhi (vidya baalan) se film chunate samay kis tarah kaa saport miltaa he?beshak sab apni raay dete hai
 But the final decision is my own
 in logon se kisi bhi baat ke har pahalu ko samajhane main madad milti he
 Vidya Balan praised you after watching Aashiqui-2, how did you feel? That moment was very special for me because my whole family came to see this film
 film kaa and hone ke baad sabake chehre par jo imoshan maine dekhe vah mere liye sabase emportent the

 baaki filmon par abhi baat chal rahi he kuch bhi final nahin hua he
 The 'best' assesses that the government's strategy has worked to a large extent but there is no scope to live in Mughalate
 iske liye grih mantri pi
 Chidambaram deserves congratulations, but the threat remains and major systemic changes need to be made
 " "arun puri, pradhan sampadak, india tudeh26 / 11 ke baad india today ke 'aatank ke khilaaf jang' abhiyaan ke hisse ke taur par board of exparts on security and teror (best) kaa gathan march 2009 main kiya gaya tha or tabhi hamaari pehali baithak hui thi
 The idea behind this was that readers could be informed about the opinions of experts on security and terror and the measures that could be taken to deal with them
 hamaara dhyaan seemaa paar ke aatank par hi he or jahaan tak aatanki hamalon kii baat he to pichley 11 maheenon main koi badi ghatana nahin hui he
 Is it our good luck or has the government done anything? Meanwhile, other issues related to security and terror have emerged
 naksali aatank ab rashtriya agenda main sabase upar he or ham aapse jaananaa chaahate hai ki sarkaar ko isse kaise nibatna chahie
 Obviously, we cannot always blame Pakistan, which is beset by its own internal problems, but has no regrets over what it has been doing to India and is still adamant
 in sabake alaava, china ke saath tanaav bhi he
 We want to know from you how India is dealing with China and what needs to be done in this matter
 raaj chengappa, prabandh sampadak, india tudemarch main best kaa akalan tha ki sarkaar 26 / 11 ke baad aatanki khatre se nibatane main puri tarah naakaam rahi he
 Exactly one month later, it is 26 / 11 and we need to assess what progress we have made in this direction
 kya koi badlaav hua he yaa phir jaisaa ki arun ne kaha ki kya yah hamaari khushkismati he ki seemaa paar se koi bada aatanki hamalaa nahin hua?veda marwaah, purv rajyapal, jharkhanda26 / 11 ke baad koi bhi badi ghatana na hone ke peeche kai karkon ne kaam kiya
 Some of this credit goes to the government and some to the events in Pakistan, where jihadis are struggling to preserve their existence; India and Jammu and Kashmir are no longer at the top of their agenda
 agar pakistani fouj jeet jaati he to hamen pareshaani hogi or agar jihadi jeet gaye to jaahir he, hamen or bhi zyada pareshaani hogi
 P
 chidambaram ke grih mantri banane se suraksha agenciyon-khufia agenciyon, rajya police or ardhsainik balon-main tatparta kii bhaavana paidaa karne main madad mili he
 Certain legislative measures have been taken, the law has been made stricter and an investigation agency has been formed by enacting an anti-illegal activity act
 lekin sarkaar ko mugalate main nahin rahanaa chahie
 The threat still remains and as soon as the situation in our neighborhood becomes normal, the jihadis will consider us the main targets
 vahaan unka jaal maujuud he, uski pahchaan karke uskaa khaatmaa nahin kiya gaya he
 It can be activated when the right opportunity comes
 iske liye sarkaar ko ab bhi kai tarah ke upaay karne kii jarurat he
 One of those measures is that the government should give the National anti-terrorism Agency the right to monitor the events of the country and the world
 use har ghatana kaa vishleshan karke apni taiyaari ko pukhta banane ke upaay karne chahie
 We need a comprehensive law that investigative agencies, prosecutors and courts can understand
 sabhi rajnatik partiyon ko ek rashtriya aam sahmati banani chahie or unhen aatanki ghatnaon kaa rajnatik phayda uthaane kaa prayaas nahin karnaa chahie
 Satish Nambiar, former Deputy Chief of Staff: Last year we started with the premise that we should focus on prevention
 main pichley kuch samay se is par vishesh dhyaan de rahaa hum or yah mahatvapurn he
 It is about a year now and we have not had any major accidents
 lihaaja, hamen iskaa shrey sarkaar ko dena chahie
 i also want the precautionary strategy to be formulated and the ability to carry out precautionary attacks on terrorists belonging to jihadi groups
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki hamen unke thikaanon kaa pataa lagaana hoga or yah maaloom karnaa hoga ki unka netaa kahaan rahata he
 If we have not done so, it is a serious matter
 vaayu sena ke paas sateek hamale karne kii kshamta he
 We should focus on developing this capability because we cannot wait for accidents
 hamen aatanki hamalon se bachane kaa har upaay karnaa chahie
 Brahm Chellani, Professor, Strategic Studies, Center for Policy Studies: There has been no terrorist attack since last 11 months but this does not mean that the risk of terrorist attacks in India has decreased since the last attack
 aatanki hamalon se khatre kaa str pehle jaisaa hi he lekin kya ham pehle se zyada taiyaar hai? haa, ham sansthagat taur par nahin balki sarkaar kii pratikriya ke str par pehle se zyada taiyaar hai
 This shows that if you put a professional in charge of a ministry, it can bring change
 chidambaram ke grih mantri banane ke baad se hi bharat kii aantarik suraksha niti main badlaav laane kaa sochaa-samaj prayaas dikh rahaa he
 He started from scratch and today he knows exactly what is going on
 iske alaava, unhone sab par dabaav banaae rakhaa he
 Every morning he meets with heads of various agencies and the National Security Advisor (NSA)
 lihaaja, pehali baar varisht str par samanvay ho rahaa he
 The Prime Minister has given him an open exemption and does not interfere in the implementation of the policies of the Ministry of Home Affairs and that is why you see a radical change in the management of India's internal security policy
 pichley saadhe teen saal maine pradhanmantri ko baar-baar yah kehete suna he ki naksalwad bharat kii suraksha ke liye sabase bada khatra he, lekin isse nibatane ke liye koi karrwai nahin kii gai
 It is enough to indicate danger
 lekin ab ham achaanak naksali hinsa se nibatane ke liye koi ranneeti nahin to kam-se-kam ek prayaas dekh rahe hai
 All this is being done at the private level
 agar vah vyakti us jagah par na ho to kya hoga, ham phir usee jagah par pahunch jaaenge jahaan ek saal pehle the
 It is important that no major terrorist attack took place during the last 11 months as we have decided not to forget 26 / 11
 bhale hi hamen maaloom he ki pakistan is maamle main kuch nahin karegaa lekin hamane un par dabaav banaae rakhane ke liye unhen dosier saunpane kii niti apana rakhi he
 Initially, i doubted my understanding of being a dossier and handing it over to a sponsor of terrorism
 abhi tak hamane dekha he ki in dociron ne unhen asantulit kar rakhaa he or ye pakistan ko yaad dilaate rahete hai ki jab tak vah 26 / 11 ke sarganaon ke khilaaf karrwai nahin karegaa tab tak bharat ke saath sambandh saamaanya nahin honge
 Earlier, the government had not shown the will to persist on the same strategy for more than a few months
 shame al-shaikh main is ranneeti ke palatney kii naubat aa gai thi
 But then backtracked
 ek tarah se pakistan ko yah saaf sandesh de diya gaya he ki sari jimmedaari usee kii he
 Ajit Kumar Doval, Former Director, Intelligence Bureau (IB): When you say, "is India more than ready to deal with terrorist attacks?", Terrorist threats need to be seen in two areas
 pehla, pakistan or aatanki samoohon kaa vajood he; or doosraa, vah pratikriya he jo bharat sarkaar unhen rokane or dandit karne kii ehtiyaati karrwai kii apni kshamta ke mutabik detii he
 The level of terror has reduced — in part because of the events going on within Pakistan, in part because of diplomatic pressure on Pakistan, in part because India has made a good diplomatic effort — to keep the pressure on
 Has played his cards for, corrected him and not let him go in the freezer
 pakistan ko yah ehsaas ho gaya he ki kisi bhi gupt karrwai kii use asweekaarya keemat chukaani pad sakati he
 They seemed to be assessing this, as evidenced by the recent visit of Major General Mahmood Ali Durrani, former Pakistan National Security Advisor
 jaanch ke liye sanghathan banane ke alaava sansthagat badlaav bade paimaane par nahin hue hai
 Chidambaram has been successful in fixing the situation
 aisa nahin he ki koi nai kshamta viksit kii he balki maujuuda kshamta kaa hi puri tarah dohan kiya ja rahaa he
 Intelligence services can play an important role by being active
 hamaari khufia sevaayen bhi behatar pradarshan kar rahi hai or ab ve pehle se kahin zyada prabhavi ho gai hai
 Yes
 parthasarathi, pakistan main bharat ke purv ucchayuktahpakistan ke asli niti niyantaaon ko prabhavit karne kii bharat kii kshamta simit he
 Your relations with the Pakistani army are limited
 pakistani fouj par keval america, china or saudi arab kaa hi dabadabaa he
 Now it seems that Saudi Arabia is also doing what the US wants
 mujhe lagata he ki kashmir ko afghanistan-pakistan ke puure aatankwaadi sameekaran main shaamil karne ke pakistani prayaas ko karine se naakaam kar diya gaya he
 Therefore, the entire focus is on Afghanistan and Pakistan
 duusari baat yah he ki ham isi vyavastha main kaam karne main sakasham hue hai or kerri-lugar act main kuch praavdhaan karwaae hai
 In this Act, for the first time a condition has been laid for the assistance given to Pakistan and there is a provision to stop cross-border terrorism
 yah jaan-boojhkar kiya gaya prayaas he or iskaa shrey duutavas or rajdoot ko diya janaa chahie
 We have been able to influence one side, but we have also come out of the initial pressure
 hamen iesai se nibatane ke liye kam-se-kam duusari koi vyavastha dhundhani hogi
 There can be a debate on whether to share intelligence with them or not, but we should make it very clear what they should not do and what we mean by the terrorist structure
 yah dekha janaa he ki yah kargar kaise hoga
 Pakistan has spent all its strength on its western border and will have to pay a costly price if it repeats a mistake or dares to repeat an event like 26 / 11
 yah sandesh mukhyatah is vajah se spasht ho gaya he ki us aatanki hamale se kai deshon ke naagarik prabhavit hue, sabase badhkar israeliyon ko bhi iskaa dansh jhelana padaa
 This was the result of Mumbai scandal
 bharat ne iskaa phayda uthaaya, or darasal, isane un kai chizon ko bemaani kiya jo purvavarti sarkaar karti rahi thi, masalan pakistani aatankwaad kaa shikaar hone par ronaa ronaa, aatankwaad ke khilaaf sanyukt karrwai, aadi tamaam betuki baaten
 If the government changes its attitude in the case of Pakistan and tells it that it will have to pay the price for its actions, and what it means by the structure of terrorism, it will work
 pakistan kii haalat bahut najuk he or mujhe lagata he ki uski fouj wajiristaan main musiibat main funs jaaegi

 That is why we should not let our security system be reduced under any circumstances
 chidambaram ne sarkaar kaa maahaul badla he or aatankwaad ke prati sarkaar kii drushti ko badla he
 But in the case of China, the government has gone the other direction

 Saudi Arabia has kept silence at the Organization of the Islamic Conference, besides casting a vote on Kashmir
 kapil kaak, atirikt nideshak, centre for air power stadiapichley 11 maheenon main kuch na hone par ham khud ko badhai de rahe hai
 Look at it from another perspective
 kuch isliye nahin hua he kyonki pakistan apni pashchimi seemaa par ulajh hua he
 After 26 / 11, infiltration in Jammu and Kashmir has reduced drastically
 yah prati din 13 se ghatakar ek se bhi kam ho gai he
 The level of preparation has increased since Chidambaram took over, but we need to do a lot more
 agar hawaii hamalaa kiya jaataa he, jisaki ashanka he or jisaki charchaa kii jaati rahi he, to ham dakshin main usase nibatane ke liye katai taiyaar nahin hai
 There is no radar to detect air intrusion in that area
 jab tak ham aatanki hamalon ko rokane ke liye homeland security jaisaa koi aadhaar nahin taiyaar karte tab tak khaas kuch nahin kiya ja saktaa
 There has been a lot of improvement in the matter of intelligence gathering, but i am not sure that there has been any improvement in the matter of assessment
 bhavishya kii kisi bhi vyavastha ke liye aatankwaad se nibatane ke maamle main philhal or agle 10-15 varshon main paristhitiyon kii jaankaree mahatvapurn hogi
 i think that after 26 / 11, there was a lot of understanding about not adopting the military option
 hamane is falsafe ke bharpoor phaayde dekhe hai
 Yes, we have the ability to attack accurately and it has been improved with full efficiency and we are capable of punishing accurately
 lekin hamen apane sameekaran main yah bhi rakhane kii jarurat he ki pakistan kisi hamale yaa hamalon kii jhadi par palatwaar karne se nahin chukegaa
 Are we ready for a limited war? i would like to adopt the Chinese approach in this matter
 vietnam yuddh ke baad ve donon pairon ke bich poonch dabaa kar beijing waapas laut gaye kyonki ve vikaas karnaa chaahate the
 We should follow the same strategy and keep in mind that the most important strategy for India is to maintain its growth rate of 9 percent for the next 20 years
 kiran bedi, purv diji, beuro of police research and deveopmentmaare paas das lakh se yaada pulisavaale hai
 i do not know if there has been any assessment of their training, welfare or personnel policy
 ham koi nivesh nahin karte or police ke kaamkaaj or ham par uske prabhaav ke bare main mujhe police dwaara kiya koi nishpaksh akalan nahin dikhaa
 The real intelligence, the most important task to deal with terror is the foot soldiers
 mujhe nahin lagata ki chidambaram paidal sipaahiyon tak pahunch paae hai
 Chidambaram has so far reached the Central Police Organizations (cpos)
 unhone ibi pramukh or enese se mulaakaat kii he, lekin rajyon ke police pramukhon se bhent mulaakaat kyon nahin kii? biguef or siarpief ko apni baithak main shaamil karnaa chahie or duusare sipio ko bhi shaamil karnaa chahie
 i don't think the response is really improving
 ve abhi tak pratikriyaatmak hi hai
 i want Chidambaram to develop leadership
 mujhe nahin lagata ki ve aisa kar rahe hai
 i do not see impatience in them
 hamen acha netaa banane ke liye jaldbaaji kerani chahie
 If Chidambaram says that police is a state subject then it is not acceptable to me because they can develop leadership
 shaayad ham unase zyada ummid lagaae baithe hai
 There is a big difference in our reactions to this meeting and the earlier meeting; The last meeting showed complete helplessness
 aaj bhale hi hamaari sthiti behatar ho gai he lekin hamen santusht nahin hona chahie
 We expect Chidambaram to have better methodology, structure, system, response, human resource policy to the bottom
 ajay saahani, kaaryakari nideshak, centre for canaflict stadymain kiran kii raay se sahamat hum
 There has been a huge change in the atmosphere but it is basically seen as superficial
 buniyadi baat yah he ki hamaari aakankshaayen kaaphi oonchi hai
 Our standards have fallen so low that we are happy to see anyone doing anything
 bharat duniya main iklauta aisa desh he jahaan logon ko apana kaam karne ke liye puja jane lagata he
 What has been done in terms of change in real capacity? Yes, there has been some improvement in the utilization of existing capacity
 kuch kshetron main khufia jaankaree mahatvapurn he, kendriya agenciyon ko rajya agenciyon ke saath samanvay karne kaa prayaas shuru karne ke liye taiyaar kar diya gaya he
 Is our preparation better? Chidambaram's reply was, "we are as weak as we were on 26 / 11
" '' behatar hoga ki agar ve mahaj centre ke nahin balki puure desh ke grih mantri ban jaaen
 This work is not theirs
 ve nichle str par thane nahin chalaa sakate
 Yes, they can create better environment by better coordination, but they cannot run the security system of the whole country
 main unke purvavarti shivaraj patil kaa prashansak nahin hum lekin yah kahana bilkul betuka tha ki patil ko pad chhod dena chahie kyonki mumbai main aatanki hamalaa ho gaya
 It is the responsibility of Mumbai Police to coordinate with other agencies and protect Mumbai
 kya aaj mumbai police kii sthiti pehle se behatar he? rashtriya suraksha guard (enesji) or mumbai police ke force van ko aisi jagah jameen aavantit kii gai he jis par ek builder ne atikaraman kar rakhaa he or vahaan jhuggi basti aabaad he
 a meeting can be held with all the Directors General of Police of the country, but do those Directors have such a police force that can be effective? No
 odisha main 207 ipies afasar hone chahie
 But there are only 84 officers
 rajya police balon main vibhinn staron par netritv main 30-40 fisadi kshamta kii kami he
 You can coordinate as you wish and pass any law in the country, but who will implement that law? 1 per one lakh population
 2 nyaayadhishon ke boote kuch nahin kar sakate
 The ratio is between 11 and 39 worldwide
 kisi bhi police bal ke paas kshamta na ho to vah kaarykushalta ke saath kaam nahin kar saktaa
 The IB has improved a lot in terms of coordination but what has been done in terms of capacity building? Also, any effort after a certain level is not going to reduce our weakness
 police balon ke prashikshan par gaur karen: 13 saptaah ke prashikshan ke baad hi nae rangaruton ko vishesh abhiyaan vaale daston main shaamil kar liya jaataa he
 Chidambaram is doing a good job but it is not his responsibility to save India
 baaki vyavastha ab bhi thap padi he or kul kshamta main kaaphi kami he or unki bharpai kii dar itani dhimi he ki jaldi hi chidambaram ke prayaason par chunautiyaan haaavee ho jaaengi
 You can celebrate for 11 months if there is no major event but it has nothing to do with any of our reactions; We do not have the resources to deal with the great danger we are dealing with

 hamen yah dekhnaa chahie ki 26 / 11 ke baad pehali baar hamane antarrashtriya samudaay ke saamne sabit kar diya ki pakistan bigadel desh he
 The neighboring country has come on the defensive due to the pressure of the whole episode of gathering evidence and preparing dossiers of all of them to Pakistan
 aisa nahin he ki lashkar-e-tayba yaa hijbul mujahidin jaise aatanki sanghathan ham par hamalaa kar rahe hai, balki ye hamale pakistani fouj or iesai kar rahi he

 If there is a terrorist attack in Hyderabad, then how much time will the NSG stronghold there take to interfere in the outskirts of the city? In the traffic system of Hyderabad, it will take at least one and a half hours to reach there

 The NSG team present in the metropolis will have to immediately initiate action on the terror attack and for that the officer will have to immediately give the authority
 kya 26 / 11 jaisi ghatana phir ghat sakati he?haa, kabhi bhi
 Our response may be better

 ’ The European court has given companies full exemption to ban Muslim women employees from wearing hijabs
 duniya bhar main muslim mahilaon ke hijaab pahanane ke adhikaar or dharmik swatantraaa ko lekar chhidi bahes ke bich europea adaalat kaa yah faisla saamne aayaa he
 This is the first case of its kind in which the court has justified the ban on women wearing hijab
 adaalat ne kaha ki kaarysthal par mahila karmchaariyon kehijaab pahananaper roak lagaana bhedbhaav nahin he
 In a European court, two women employees from Belgium and France filed a petition against the companies banning the wearing of hijab
 haalanki adaalat ne inaki yachika khaarij kar di or companiyon ke hijaab pahanane sambandhi roak ko sahi tehraaya
 These women were fired from companies for refusing to wear the hijab
 belgium kii yachikakarta mahila karmchaaree G4S Secure Solutions main bataur resepshanist karyrat thi, jabaki france kii mahila ek iti kansaltent hai
 The petitioner women had argued that the ban on wearing hijab is a violation of religious freedom, but the court rejected it
 darasal, G4S ne 2006 memhijab pahanane paraupchaarik rup se pratibandh laga diya tha, lekin mahila karmchaariyon ne jab hijaab pahananaa band nahin kiya, to company ne ise kanoon bananaa diya
 At the same time, the French company had banned the wearing of the hijab of the female employee on the complaint of the customers
 iske baad bhi nahin maanane par muslim mahilaon ko naukari se nikaal diya tha
 After this, there was a debate about the religious freedom of women

 mumbai main avaidh nirmaan badi sankhya main hai
 The question is, will BMC take action on all of them? buudhvaar ko oshivara main d building kii 9 veen manzil par bane kapil sharma ke flats kaa panchnaama hona tha
 The BMC staff were preparing to go to the police station that the Oshiwara police postponed the Panchnama further by saying that they were busy
 buudhvaar ko bhale hi panchnaama kisi karanvash tal gaya lekin iskaa yah matlab nahin ki kapil batch gaye
 There will be Panchnama and action in one or two days
 sirf flats main avaidh nirmaan ke liye nahin balki mangrove kaa nuksaan karne ke liye bhi
 According to Forest Department Assistant Forest Officer Makrand Ghodke, they will soon submit their investigation report to the collector so that legal action can be initiated against Kapil
 sawaal he ki kya puri mumbai main sirf kapil sharma ne hi avaidh nirmaan kiya he or mangrove ko nuksaan pahunchaaya he? jaankaron kii maane to jahaan kapil kaa bangala he vahaan 50 ke kareeb aise bangale hai jinamein avaidh nirmaan saaf dikhataa he
 Likewise, Andheri city of Andheri or Mud and Marve in Malad West, 80 percent of the bungalows built there are illegal
 kuch to endi jone par bane hai jahaan nirmaan kaary ho hi nahin saktaa
 Will they all be processed? kabhi mumbai main bulldozer main ke naam se mashhoor biemasi ke purv adhikari jiaar khernaar kaa kahana he ki yah to visal blor ko hi katghare main khadaa karne vaali baat he
 It should be said that action should be taken against those officers who allow illegal construction
 samay rahete use rokte nahin
 The comments biemasi ke ek ward se mili artiai aankade par gaur karen to avaidh nirmaanon ke khilaaf karrwai main biemasi kii udaseenta saaf dikhaai padati he
 According to RTI, in 2013, notices were given to 597 illegal constructions in El Ward, but only 250 were broken
 or 2014 main 505 main se sirf 178 avaidh nirmaanon par hi hathaudaa padaa tha
 This means that bmc's record of breaking or stopping illegal construction in Mumbai is not good
 zyaadaatar log bhi le dekar kaam chalaane main hi samajhadaari maanate hai

 Announcing the first monitoring policy after the central bank's bimonthly and 8 November demonetisation decision, Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel has ruled out any reduction in the repo rate
 bazaar ko ummid thi ki notebandi ke dabaav se baahar nikaalane ke liye rigerv bank kam se kam 25 basis point kii katautee kar saktaa he
 But despairing the market, the Reserve Bank raised the repo rate to 6
 25 fisadi par barkaraar rakhaa he
 Earlier in his first review after being appointed as RBI governor in October, Patel had cut interest rates by 25 basis points
 puraani karency kii dikkaton se bainkon ko rahatariserv bank ne apni samiksha main bainkon ke liye ahm failsa liya he
 After the demonetisation, the Reserve Bank had increased the incremental CRR to 100 percent due to the chronic currency problem that is accumulating in the country's banks
 iskaa matlab rigerv bank ne bainkon kii karency lene se manaa kar diya tha
 Today, the Reserve Bank has withdrawn its decision through monetary policy and has completely rejected incremental CRR from December 10
 nahin ghategi aapaki iemainotbandi ke baad desh main bainkon ke saamne atirikt cash kii samasya ko dekhte hue rigerv bank ne unhen byaaj daron ke jariye kisi tarah kii raahat dene se manaa kar diya he
 So, now your EMI will remain the same
 saste nahin hua karjrepo rate barkaraar rakhane ke faisle se ab bainkon ke liye byaaj daron main katautee karne kaa rasta nahin khulaa
 It was believed that with the increased cash after demonetisation, the country's banks will exercise to increase their business
 lekin aaj ke faisle ke baad ab vah puraani daron par hi karj dene ke liye majaboor hai
 During the two-day monetary review, the threat of rising interest rates in the US is that Urjit Patel is eyeing a meeting of the US Central Bank next week
 vittiya jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki america bank byaaj daron main ijapha kar saktaa he
 Keeping in mind the situation of this increase, today the Reserve Bank decided on its interest rates
 kya he maudrik samiksharijrv bank do maheene ke antaraal par desh kii monitory policy ko do dinon tak chalane vaali baithak main tay karata he
 The meeting consists of 3 members from the Reserve Bank and 3 experts in financial matters
 samiksha kii adhyakshata khud rigerv bank governor karte hai
 What is the repo rate: The rate of interest at which the Reserve Bank gives loans to other banks in the country is called repo rate
 bainkon ke liye yah rate apane graahakon ko lone kaa byaaj tay karne ke kaam aata he
 Whenever a reduction in repo rate is announced in a monetary policy, it simply means that now your banks will make all your loans cheaper
 masalan, home lone, vehical lone ityadi kam daron par muhaiyaa honge
 What is the reverse repo rate? All banks have to deposit all the cash collected on a fixed cash in the currency chest of the Reserve Bank
 rigerv bank is reverse repo rate par jamaaye karaae gaye cash par bainko ko byaaj detaa he
 Through this, the Reserve Bank decides the availability of currency in the market
 kya he siaraar (nakad arakshit anupaat)rigerv bank ke niyam ke mutabik sabhi bainkon ko apni kul nakadi kaa ek nishchit hissaa rigerv bank ke paas rakhana hota he
 This fixed portion is called Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)
 kya he esaelardesh ke sabhi commercial bainkon ko apana kuch paisa sarkaar ke paas rakhana hota he
 The government can use this money in case of an emergency
 bainkon kaa yah paisa nakadi, sona yaa phir sarkaar kii security kharid kar jamaa kiya jaataa he

 Baba Ramdev is a "thug"
 bhaajapa ''nachniyon'' kii party he
 What does Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh say about himself because of his slippery tongue? Recently he told the media, "I am a cannon every now and then
 '' shaayad in teenon tippaniyon main yah teesri hi sabase mufeed he
 Once known as an iconoclast of sophistication and elegance, as familiar with Kabir's couplets as Apple's imac, Digvijay Singh has now become an embarrassment to his colleagues in government
 kapil sibbal ke liye yah safai dena bahut baari pad gaya ki kyon chaar-chaar cabinet mantri us aadmi ko pataane ke liye daud laga rahe the, jise unke hi ek saathi ne thag qaraar diya
 Digvijay further increased the government's trouble by criticizing Ramdev for visiting him at the airport
 iske pehle party ne is bare main apni naaraazgi jaahir nahin kii thi, haalanki aisi khabaren thim ki varisht mantriyon ko airport par bhejne ke pradhanmantri ke faisle se madam (sonia gandhi) naakhush hai
 Where others whisper, Digvijay speaks indiscriminately
 digvijay ne ek tivi intervyuu main kaha, ''main ramdev se koi baatcheet na karata
 i felt very bad that Pranab da (mukherjee) went to meet him at the airport
 ve sabase varisht cabinet mantri hai, jo tab se kendriya mantri hai, jab baba ramdev kaa udai bhi nahin hua tha
 He put his political career at stake and went to convince Baba Ramdev about the state of the government
 ''haalanki digvijay ne baad main is baatcheet kaa bachaav bhi kiya, ''agar hamane unase baat nahin kii hoti to har koi kahata ki yah aisi parrty he, jo bhrashtachar par baat bhi nahin karnaa chaahati
 At least on our part, we tried our best to make them understand how unrealistic their demands are
 ''ramdev ke bare main ab party bhi digvijay ke hi raste par chal rahi he, beshak party kii bhashaa unke str kii nahin he
 The scene of hardcore Hindu leader Sadhvi Ritambhara with Ramdev not embracing Congress leaders
 yah bahut hi anokhaa kshan he ki digvijay or grahamantri pi
 Both Chidambaram are unanimous
 chidambaram ne kaha, ''ramdev ko aresas ne khadaa kiya he
 "the intention is to provoke Ramdev apart from Anna Hazare to create a rift among the activists
" digvijay kehete hai, ''anna ramdev se alag hai
 He is a Gandhian
 '' congress ne alag-alag jabaanen bolne kii kala sikh lee he, khaas taur par jab uski sarkaar kaa koi daanv ulataa pad jaae
 Digvijay's language is actually his master's language
 sonia gandhi ke varadahast ke bagaiyr ve is tarah bol nahin sakate
 He is considered to be the main guide of Rahul Gandhi
 digvijay daawa karte hai ki unhen kabhi apana munh band karne ko nahin kaha gaya
 He told India Today, "nobody has ever asked me for any explanation
" '' khud ko yun paak-saaf sabit karne kii unki baat par bharosa karnaa bahut mushkil he
 He says, "I do not intend to get into any controversy
" main sirf tathyon ke bare main bolta hum, sach bolta hum
 Digvijay, who was the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh twice, now has the responsibility of Rahul's favorite project - winning Uttar Pradesh again for the Congress
 congress ke galiyaaron main ye donon raja or yuvaraj ke naam se jane jate hai
 But while Rahul rarely opens his tongue on important national issues, Digvijay compensates by speaking too much
 jab digvijay kuch zyada hi simaaen laanghte hai to alaakaman unki vivaadaaspad tippaniyon se kinaaraa kar letaa he
 This happened during his visit to Azamgarh last year, when he questioned about the Batla House encounter
 yah congress ke liye sabase mufeed tha ki dilli main vah ek hi sur main bol rahi thi or jab purrvi uttar pradesh ke muslim vot bank kaa sawaal aayaa to uskaa sur badal gaya
 However, Digvijay Singh is paying the price of giving too much love to the Muslims of Uttar Pradesh
 ve vishwasaneeyata kho rahe hai
 Take his recent remarks about Osama bin Laden being buried at sea
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki ek apradhi ko bhi haq he ki uski dharmik aasthaa ke mutabik uskaa antim sanskaar kiya jaae
 a cabinet minister said, "the problem with Digvijay Singh is that when he is asked" have you stopped beating your wife ", he also starts answering this question
 ''digvijay singh jor dete hai ki unki tippanee laden ji ko ''sandarrbh se katkar'' liya gaya
 They say, "why would i address him like this?" i never praised him
 main akelaa vyakti hum, jisane saiyad ali shah gilaani or imam bukhari ke khilaaf bayaan diya, jinhone laden ke liye shoksabhaa rakhi
 i have struggled against Muslim fundamentalism as much as i have against Hindu fundamentalism
 ''digvijay singh ke saath traasadee yah he unhone osama ko laden ji kaha, is baat par bharosa karnaa zyada aasaan he, banisbat unki is safai ke ki ve vyangyatmak lahaze main bol rahe the
 He says sternly, "you have misunderstood Digvijay Singh's views
 digvijay singh kattar congressi he, jo udaaravaadi gandhivadi vichaardhaara maanata he or kattartavaad ke har mukhute ke saath ladanaa chahta he
 "this Thakur leader often says that Siyat is the art of possibilities
" vot bank kii is raajnneeti main congressjan digvijay ke aakraamak bayanon ko apane divangat guru kii tarah khud ko nae sire se gadhane kii ek kala ke rup main dekhte hai
 Arjun Singh, the second Thakur of Madhya Pradesh, tried to change the same
 behatar hoga ki digvijay singh yaad karen ki ek baar arjuna singh ke bare main seetaram kesari ne kya kaha tha, ''unka dimag aisa he ki agar aap usamen keel daalenge to vah scru banakar baahar aegi
 Digvijay Singh's target is clear
 congress ke paas vyapak janaadhar vaala koi bharosemand muslim netaa, khaastaur se uttar pradesh main nahin he
 But why are they bypassing the Thakur vote, which may come naturally with them? Amar Singh has formed an entire party to manage the Thakur vote bank and Thakur has eight ministers in Mayawati's government
 digvijay singh kehete hai, ''main jativaadee nahin hum, congressi hum
 "but while explaining his politics, he says that he is also a" grassroots leader "
 ''ham sab congress ke sakriy kaaryakarta hai, upar se thope gaye netaa nahin
 "of course Digvijay can do much better than this
 ek baar to ve kar chuke hai
 Not ruling out the possibility of a premature general election, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said that all parties, including the Congress, are ready for the Lok Sabha elections
 jab akhilesh se poocha gaya ki kya unhen samaypurv aam chunaav kii sambhaavna najar aati he, unhone kaha, ‘dekhie, sabhi dal taiyaar hai
 And when i see the advertisements in the newspapers, i feel that even the Congress is ready (for the general election)
 ’ upie-2 sarkaar kii chauthi vasharganth ke avasar par ratribhoj se unki samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke dur rahane ke bare main puche jane unhone kaha, ‘ham ek baar bhoj main shaamil hue the or duusari baar yah radd kar diya gaya
 As far as the dinner on Wednesday night is concerned, it would be better if you ask Netaji (SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav)
 ’uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri navi mumbai main uttar pradesh bhawan kaa udghaatan karne ke baad samvaadadaata sammelan ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 When asked if the relationship between Congress and SP was no longer the same, he said, 'our support to the UPA is only to keep communal forces away
 ’ akhilesh ne kaha, ‘lekin hamane bhrashtachar or mahangaai jaise muddon par apane vichaar rakhe hai
 We socialists never agreed with the policies of the Congress but when it comes to deal with communal forces, we support the Congress
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘samarthan jari rahegaa yaa nahin, is vishay par hamaari party kii rashtriya kaaryakarini or netaji (mulaayam) tay karenge
 On the subject of the Third Front, Akhilesh said, 'wherever there are non-congress governments, their Chief Minister will try to ensure that the maximum members of his party are elected to the Lok Sabha, be it Tamil Nadu, or West Bengal, or Odisha
 , Or Uttar Pradesh or Bihar
 isliye, koi bhi is sambhaavna ko khaarij nahin kar saktaa
 The biggest thing is the base position and strength of politics
 ’ akhilesh ne kaha ki unki praathamikta anya kshetron khaskar mumbai or maharashtra main sapa ko majboot karnaa he
 He appreciated the contribution of the people of Uttar Pradesh living in Mumbai to the sp's victory in the election here

 yah mahaj ittefaq he ki ye chaaron senior khilaadi baayen haath ke ballebaaj hai or jayasoorya ko chhodkar anya teenon ko sabase zyada aadhaar mulya chaar lakh dollars vaale varg main rakhaa gaya he

 is hafte cinema ghar 'housephul' honge yaa nahin yah bataaegi is hafte release hui film 'housephul-3' jiske do kaamyaab sikval pehle hi aa chuke hai, pichhali do 'housephul' kaa nirdesan kiya tha sajid khan ne, lekin 'housephul-3' kaa nirdesan kiya he sajid-farhaad ne or ise likhaa bhi isi jodi ne he
 The film is a multistarrer film where you will see Akshay Kumar, Abhishek Bachchan, Ritesh Deshmukh, Jackie Shroff, Baman Irani, Jacqueline Fernandes, Lisa Haydon, Nargis Fakri and Chunky Pandey in the lead roles
 film kii kahani kuch kuch waisi hi he jaisi kii 'houseful-2' main thi, yani 3 ladke jo amir ladakiyon se shaadi karnaa chaahate hai, vahiin 'houseful-2' main ladakiyon ke pita amir ladke dhund rahe hote hai or phir jo jo aap andaaza laga sakate hai film main vahi hota he
 Means to show something else by hiding your identity, then the arrival of the villain, killing and becoming sick
 
 
 to kahani main bataane ko zyada kuch nahin he
 'housefull 3' is a slapstick comedy, ie running, falling, making cross faces diagonally, where there are one liners, there are jokes and characters that might make you laugh
 'housephul 3' kisi he, yah bataane se pehle kamedi ke bare main main apane kuch vichaar rakhana chaahunga, pehali baat kamedi ek relitive chiz he yani paraspar sambadhit he jahaan kisi ko kisi baat par hansi aa sakati he or kisi ko nahin, kai baar hamen kisi ke bolne ke andaaz par hi hansi aa jaati he, par koi us par muskuraataa bhi nahin he
 So for any comedy, you can take a better decision yourself whether the comedy is good or bad, see if you made me laugh or not
 ab baari rivyuu kii he, jahaan main aapako bataaunga kii yah film dekhakar mujhe hansi ai yaa nahin or mujhe kisi lagi 'housephul 3' or wo bhi kuubiyon or kaamiyon ke saath, jisamen sabase pehle baat kaamiyon kii
 First of all, there is no newness in the story
 is film ke shuruyaat main teenon nayakon ke kirdaaron kaa parichay naireshan ke saath diya jaataa he, jo kii lanbaa or ubaau lagata he
 At the same time i felt that there could have been a better way to do this, before the intermission i felt more laughs and less smiles in some parts of the film, as well as i felt that i was being told to use different types of sound effects
 Laugh here
 film ke is bhaag main mujhe editing or dialogs donon kii hi dhar kam tej nazar nahin ai
 The three girls appeared to be weak in terms of comedy in the film
 film main yah teenon angrezi kaa shabdic anuwaad karti hai, jo ki inke kirdaar kaa hissaa he par hansaane kaa ye tarika kaam nahin karata
 
 
 So this was the poop
 tippaniyan Now talking about things 
 
 is film kii jaan hai akshay kumaar or ritesh deshmukh, donon kii parfect comic timming or abhinay jo aapako gudgudaayenge, film kii bahut saare drishy hai, jo aapako hansane par majaboor karenge or isamen dialogs, paristhiti or abhinay teenon kaa hi haath he
 Especially after the intermission, the music of the film is good and its two songs' Pyaar ki 'and' Phek isk i liked
 
 
 '
 The reason for 'fake Ishq' looks good is its filming which also goes with its story and makes you laugh
 jis tarah se teenon hero ke kirdaar gadhe gaye wo mujhe acha laga masalan akshay kii split personality, ritesh kaa jubaan fisalna or abhishek ek kunthit raper ke kirdaar main jo aapako kai baar hansaa jaanege, baman bhi thaak hai, par unhen ek salaah apane kirdaaron kaa zyada na doharaaen
 So this was my Roy about 'housefull 3', the rest as i said that you are a better judge of comedy, because i cannot tell how much laugh you will get by listening to a particular situation, a particular person or a special jokes or Whether it will come or not, but i got a laugh while watching this film, so 3 stars from my side
 yah film ek multistarar film he, jahaan aapako mukhya bhoomikaaon main nazar aaenge akshay kumaar, abhishek bachchan, ritesh deshmukh, jaiki shrof, baman irani, jacleen farnandis, lija heden, nargis fakari or chanki pande
 The story of the film is somewhat similar to that in 'housefull 2', that is, 3 boys who want to marry rich girls, whereas in 'housefull 2', the fathers of girls are looking for rich boys and then Joe You can guess the same thing happens in the film
 matlab apni pahchaan chupa kar kuch or dikhaanaa, phir villen kaa aana, maar khaanaa or chit ho janaa
 
 
 So there is not much to tell in the story
 'housephul 3' ek slapstick kamedi he yani bhaag daud, girnaa padana, aade tirchhe chehre bananaa vagahara-vagahara jahaan van liners hai, chutakle hai or aise kirdaar hai, jo shaayad aapako hansaa paaen
 Before explaining how 'housefull 3' is, i would like to put some thoughts about comedy, the first thing is comedy is a relatable thing that is interrelated where someone can laugh at something and not someone, many times We laugh at the way someone speaks, but no one smiles at him
 to kisa bhi kamedi ke liye aap khud behatar nirnay le sakate hai ki kamedi acchhee he yaa buree, yah dekhakar kii aapako hansi ai yaa nahin
 Now there is a Bari review, where i will tell you whether or not i laughed after watching this film and how i felt 'housefull 3' and that too with the features and flaws, in which the first thing was the flaws
 pehali baat kahani main koi nayaapan nazar nahin aata
 At the beginning of the film, the characters of the three heroes are introduced to Narration, which seems long and boring
 saath hi mujhe laga kii iskaa or behatar tarika ho saktaa tha, madhyantar se pehle mujhe film ke kuch hisson main hansi kam muskuraahat zyaada mahasoos hui, saath hi mujhe laga kii tarah-tarah ke sound effectus kaa istemaal karke mujhe bataaya ja rahaa he ki mujhe yahaan hansanaa he
 In this part of the film, i could not see the edge of both editing and dialogues less sharp
 film main kamedi ke maamle main teenon ladkiyaan kamazor nazar ain
 In the film, these three literally translate English, which is part of their character, but this method of laughing does not work
 
 
 to yah tha khanmiyaan
 The comments ab baat karte kuubiyon kii
 
 
 The life of this film is Akshay Kumar and Ritesh Deshmukh, both perfect comic timing and acting that will tickle you, there are many scenes of the film, which will make you laugh and the dialogues, situations and acting are all three
 khaastaur par madhyantar ke baad, film kaa sangeet acha he or iske do gane 'pyaar kii ' or 'fek isk mujhe acha laga
 
 
 '
 'fek ishk' ke acha lagane kaa kaaran iskaa filmakan jo ki isaki kahani ke saath bhi jaataa he or aapako hansaata bhi he
 i liked the way the characters of the three heroes were created, such as Akshay's split personality, Ritesh's tongue slipping and Abhishek as a frustrated rapper who will make you laugh many times, Baman is also chic, but he has an advice from his characters
 Do not repeat too much
 to yah thi 'houseful-3' ke bare main meri roy, baaki jaisaa maine kaha ki kamedi ke behatar jaj aap khud hai, kyonki yah main nahin bataa saktaa ki ek khaas paristhiti, khaas insaan yaa khaas chutakle ko sunakar aapako kitni hansi aegi yaa aegi bhi yaa nahin, par mujhe yah film dekhte vakt hansi ai isliye meri taraf se ise 3 stars
 Means to show something else by hiding your identity, then the arrival of the villain, killing and becoming sick
 
 
 to kahani main bataane ko zyada kuch nahin he
 'housefull 3' is a slapstick comedy, ie running, falling, making cross faces diagonally, where there are one liners, there are jokes and characters that might make you laugh
 'housephul 3' kisi he, yah bataane se pehle kamedi ke bare main main apane kuch vichaar rakhana chaahunga, pehali baat kamedi ek relitive chiz he yani paraspar sambadhit he jahaan kisi ko kisi baat par hansi aa sakati he or kisi ko nahin, kai baar hamen kisi ke bolne ke andaaz par hi hansi aa jaati he, par koi us par muskuraataa bhi nahin he
 So for any comedy, you can take a better decision yourself whether the comedy is good or bad, see if you made me laugh or not
 ab baari rivyuu kii he, jahaan main aapako bataaunga kii yah film dekhakar mujhe hansi ai yaa nahin or mujhe kisi lagi 'housephul 3' or wo bhi kuubiyon or kaamiyon ke saath, jisamen sabase pehle baat kaamiyon kii

 '' bharat-america sambandhon main ghanishthata aane ke saath hi islamabad-washington ke bich dooriyaan bad rahi hai or pakistan ab china ke kareeb aata ja rahaa he
 The US Congressional Research Service (CRS) report said that Islamabad is now becoming more reliable for Beijing with the strengthening of indo-us relations
 osama bin laden kii maut ke baad america pakistan ke rishton main ai kadavaahat ke baad se hi paak kaa china par ek antarrashtriya sahyogi ke taur par bharosa badhata ja rahaa he
 The report said that it was only after the visit of Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani to China in May that the Chinese government said that the West should respect the sovereignty of Pakistan
 china pakistan ko 50 jeef 17 ladaaku vimaan jald saunpane ke liye bhi taiyaar ho gaya
 Now Pakistan is also talking to China for the purchase of six submarines
 siares ne kaha, ‘paak sarkaar ko us samay kuch sharmindagi kaa saamana karnaa padaa jab is yatra se laute pakistani rakshaamantri ne kaha ki guadar bandargah ko china sainya istemaal ke liye tabdeel karegaa jiske nirmaan main isane madad kii thi

 However, Beijing is not ready to give full protection to Pakistan

 diwali se pehle modi sarkaar ne kaarobaar jagat ko bada gift diya he
 The corporate income tax has been cut by the government, while the minimum alternative tax has been given
 iske alaava niveshkon ko bhi bada tohfa diya gaya he
 But the question is what will be the impact of these decisions of the government
 aaie samajhate hai
 
 
 
 1
 The biggest announcement of relief government on corporate tax is about corporate tax
 shuukravaar ko press conference karte hue vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne bataaya ki ab gharelu companiyon par bina kisi chhot ke inakam tex 22 fisadi lagegaa
 At the same time, after adding surcharge and cess to the company 25
 17 fisadi tex dena hoga
 Who will benefit? It will benefit those big companies of the country who fall in the 30% corporate tax slab
 yahaan bataa den ki companiyon kii jo bhi kamai hoti he, corporate tex us par hi lagata he
 It covers private, limited or listed and all types of companies without a list
 corporate tex ko sarkaar ke revenue kaa ahm hissaa mana jaataa he
 However, after the government's new decision 1 on revenue
 45 lakh karod rupee kaa boj padane kii ashanka he
 2
 nae nivesh par rahatsarkaar ne nae nivesh karne vaali gharelu companiyon ko bhi raahat di he
 In fact, now the businessmen who set up a manufacturing company after October 1, 2019, will have to pay income tax at the rate of 15 percent
 vahiin sabhi tarah ke sarcharge or ses lagane ke baad tex kii dar 17
 10 percent
 vartmaan main nae niveshkon ko 25 fisadi kii dar se tex dena hota he
 Who will benefit? This decision is expected to give a boost to the Make in India project of the Modi government
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki ab kaarobaari nai companiyon par jor denge
 At the same time, a sluggish start-up plan can also be encouraged
 aisi sthiti main nae rojgaar kaa srijan hoga
 However, the domestic company which will do its production after 31 March 2023 will not get the benefit of the government's relief
 3
 Relief on MAT The government has given relief in Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT)
 companiyon ko ab maujuuda 18
 MAT will have to be given at the rate of 15 percent instead of 5 percent
 darasal, MAT un companiyon par lagaaya jaataa he jo munafa to kamaati hai lekin riyaayaton kii vajah se in par tex kii dendaree kam hoti he
 Companies currently 18 on profits
 5 fisadi tak mat dena hota he
 Who will benefit? With this decision of the government, more enthusiasm can be seen in foreign companies
 darasal, videshi companiyaan is tex kii vajah se bharat main zyada nivesh karne se kataraati hai
 If the trend of foreign investors towards the Indian market increases, then the Modi government's target of $ 5 trillion economy will be easily achieved by 2025
 4
 Relief on Capital Gains: The government has announced the removal of surcharge on capital gains, giving relief to investors investing in the stock market
 beete 5 july ko aam bajet main videshi or gharelu niveshkon ko jhatka diya gaya tha
 The long-term capital gains surcharge was increased on their investment in the stock market
 kise milegaa phayda?sarkaar ke is faisle kaa matlab he ki jo log share bechney yaa equity mutual fund main nivesh karte hai unhen raahat milegi
 In fact, when an investor sells shares or mutual funds, he makes a profit in the unit
 is munaafe ko capital gens kehete hai or isi par sarkaar sarcharge vasuulati he
 What is Capital Gains Tax? Here, there are two types of capital gains - first long term and second short term capital gains
 vartmaan main 3 saal se kam samay main beche jane vaali rakam par munaafe ko short turm jabaki 3 saal se zyada samay ke baad beche jane vaali sampatti par ke munaafe ko long turm capital kaha jaataa he
 At the same time, long term capital is considered more than 1 year in terms of shares
 aam bajet main long turm ke capital gen par sarcharge ko badha diya gaya tha
 The effect was that new investors were avoiding buying shares due to low profits
 is vajah se july main share bazaar apane 17 saal ke bure daur main pahunch gaya tha
 5
 bybech par rahatsarkaar ne 5 july 2019 se pehle share bybech kaa elaan karne vaali listed companiyon par bybech tex se chhot dene kaa bhi elaan kiya he
 The biggest beneficiaries of this will be those companies that do share buybacks
 kya hota he share bibecocompany jab apane hi share niveshkon se kharidti he to ise bybech kehete hai
 After completion of this process, these shares cease to exist
 aamtaur par companiyon kii balanceshit main atirikt nakadi hota he tabhi bybech par jor detii hai
 It is not considered good to have too much cash with the company
 isse yah anumaan lagaaya jaataa he ki company apane nakadi kaa istemaal nahin kar paa rahi he
 This is the reason that the company uses its excess cash through buybacks
 saamaajik kaaryakarta or gandhivadi netaa anna hajaare ke samarthakon ne buudhvaar ko unka 74waan janmdin bade dhoomdhaam se manaaya
 Anna, however, was in New Delhi to attend the meeting of the Joint Committee drafting the Lokpal Bill
 hajaare ke sahyogi datta aavari ne bataaya ki anna ke janmdin par vriksharopan jaise kaaryakramon kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 In his ancestral village, Raylegan Siddhi in Ahmednagar district, supporters celebrated his birthday with great enthusiasm
 aavari ne bataaya ki is avasar par bhajan-kirthan kaa bhi aayojan kiya gaya
 He said that usually Anna is in his village on the occasion of birthday, but this time due to the Lokpal meeting he is not here
 aavari ne kaha ki unhen unka janmdin bahut dhoomdhaam se manaanaa pasand nahin he
 He said that Anna will turn 75 next year
 unke 75wein janmdin par unke samarthak bada jashn manaane kii yojana bana rahe hai
 In the wake of assembly elections in Bihar, talks have started on seat sharing between JDU and RJD
 parde ke peeche chal rahi is baatcheet ke asli sutaradhar sharad yadav bane hue hai jo lagaataar lalu prasad or nitish kumaar se baatcheet kar rasta nikaalane kii koshish main hai
 According to sources, the winning potential will be made the basis of heatsite sharing
 lekin khaas baat yah bhi he ki lalu or nitish main se koi bhi siton ko lekar apane daawey se peeche hatana nahin chahta he
 It is understood that while Nitish Kumar is claiming his claim on more than 120 seats, Lalu Prasad has claimed 130 seats
 seat bantwaare ko lekar donon partiyon ke bich rassakasi tay maani ja rahi he kyonki donon main se koi bhi kam siton par ladanaa nahin chahta
 While Nitish Kumar is not ready to fight on less than his seating seat
 bantwaaraa or mahagathbandhan kii ganthsit bantwaare ko lekarmahagathbandhanaki ganth saaf dikhaai dene lagi he kyonki jis teen-teen sadasyeey team kaa gathan kar donon taraf se baatcheet shuru karne kaa prastaav tha us par pani phir gaya
 So far, the names of three members on both sides have not been decided, but the top leaders have sat down to resolve the alliance
 sharad yadav lalu or nitish se ek round baatcheet kar dilli ja chuke hai
 According to sources, Lalu Prasad has put his claim on 130 seats in front of Sharad Yadav and has kept the remaining 113 seats in the JDU and Congress quota
 haalankiargedineta raghuvansh prasad kaa kahana he ki gathbandhan main koi condishan nahin ho saktaa
 Everyone has to respect each other's strength
 raghuvansh prasad singh kehete hai, 'dekhie ham kuch bolkar badnaam nahin hona chaahate, lekin agar badhiya se gathbandhan nahin hua or thik se seat shering nahin hua to kaaphi baagi khadey honge
 Those who will harm us
 aise main kaaphi soch-vichaar kar gathbandhan karnaa hoga
 On the other hand, to Nitish's Sharad, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has told Sharad Yadav that the party will not compromise on the seats won
 yani jediu 120 se kam siton par raji nahin he
 In such a situation, Sharad Yadav is finding a way between the claim of seats and counter claim between the two parties
 samajha ja rahaa he ki lalu congress ko tab tak tavajjo nahin dena chaahate jab tak unki siton kii sankhya tay nahin ho jaati, vahiin jediu philhaj apane pattey kholana nahin chaahati
 rjd's displeasure is also with Nitish Kumar becoming the lone poster boy
 lalu prasad ko lagata he ki gathbandhan ne nitish ko netaa maan liya he, lekin nitish kumaar sirf apni branding main lage hue hai
 According to Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, unilateral campaigning may damage the alliance
 dawa kshetra main epadiai kii seemaa ko lekar sarkaar ke bheetar hi jari matbhedon ke bich pradhanmantri manmohan singh dwaara somvaar ko is bare main apane varisht mantrimandaleey sahyogiyon ke saath samiksha kiye jane kii sambhaavna he

 is samiti main swasthya, udyog, vidhi tathaa vitt mantralayon ke varisht adhikari bhi shaamil the or samiti kii rapat par koi sahmati nahin ban pai he
 It is believed that the Health Ministry has given a disagreement on the report, demanding a complete ban on the acquisition of Indian pharmaceutical companies by multinationals
 ullekhneey he ki 2006 ke baad dawa kshetra main vilay evam adhigrahan ke anek saude hue hai, jinamein bahurashtriya companiyon ne renbexi va piraama healthcare jaisi gharelu companiyon kaa adhigrahan kiya he
 There is also concern among the government and society that the prices of generic medicines have increased due to these merger and acquisition deals
 congress ne pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki modi videsh main jaakar bharat ke bare main ulti-sidhi bayaanbaji kar desh ko sharmasaar kar rahe hai
 According to the Congress, Modi has been consistently claiming in his foreign tours that the country's credibility has been restored after he came to power
 unka yah daawa desh kii saakh ko gira rahaa he
 Congress leader Anand Sharma said, "we completely reject Hammodi's claim, he says that the country's credibility has been restored since he came to power
" ' sharma kaa kahana he ki modi ke daavon se lagata he ki bharat kii pehle koi vishwasaneeyata nahin thi, may 2014 main modi ke satta main aane se pehle desh kaa koi sammaan nahin tha
 Sharma said, 'by saying this thing in every country, they are embarrassing the country
 bharat kaa pehle bhi sammaan tha
 India had credibility and due to the policies of the government, even before India, India was the most preferred destination for FDI
 ' congress netaa ne modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki aaj bharat main dar kaa maahaul bana hua he or iskejimmedaar pradhanmantri hai
 Sharma said, 'modi is running a government which is functioning arbitrarily
 'bharat ashishnutaa bardaasht nahin karegaa: PM modigauratlab he ki piem modi ne guuruuvaar ko landan main kaha ki bharat kabhi bhi ashishnutaa ko bardaasht nahin karegaa
 In response to a question about communal tension in India, Modi told reporters, 'indian officials will take strong action against those involved in such (violent) incidents
 ' unhone bharat ko bhagwaan buddha or mahatma gandhi kaa desh bataate hue kaha, 'bharat ashishnutaa ko bardaasht nahin karegaa
 Modi said, 'we are a democracy
 abhivyakti kii aazaadee ke prati sankalpabaddh hai
 We are not an intolerant society
 ' Shocking the central government in the CBI vs CBI case, the Supreme Court rejected the decision to send Alok Verma on leave and allowed Alok Verma to go to office
 buudhvaar kii subah sibiai chif alok verma sibiai mukhyalay pahunche
 Alok Verma returned to the CBI office on Wednesday, Wednesday and took over as director, where he was received by interim director Nageswara Rao
 haalanki, agle ek hafte tak vah koi nitigat faisla nahin le paaenge
 Let us know that after the government's decision to send Alok Verma on leave on October 23, his office located on the 10th floor was sealed
 unki jagah em nageshwar raav ko antarim nideshak niyukt kiya tha
 The central government suffered a major setback on Tuesday when the Supreme Court reinstated Alok Kumar Verma as the CBI director
 nyaayalay ne verma ko sibiai nideshak kii shaktiyon se vanchit kar avkaash par bhejne kaa centre sarkaar kaa aadesh radd kar diya
 However, the court made it clear on Verma that he would refrain from taking any major policy decision until the High Powered Committee, which selected the CBI chief after restoration, considered the issue of taking away his powers
 verma kaa sibiai nideshak ke taur par do varsh kaa kaarykaal 31 janvari ko samaapt ho rahaa he
 However, the sword of denying Verma the powers and rights still hangs on his head
 sheersh adaalat ne kaha he ki sibiai pramukh kaa chayan karne vaali ucchadhikaar praapt chayan samiti ab bhi verma se jude maamle par vichaar kar sakati he, kyonki sivisi unke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke aaropon kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The selection committee has been asked to call a meeting within a week
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki kanoon main antarim nilamban yaa sibiai nideshak ko hataane ke sambandh main koi praavdhaan nahin he
 The apex court made it clear that any such decision can be taken only after obtaining the consent of the selection consent
 pradhan nyaayadhish ranjan gogoi, nyaayamurti sanjay kishan kaul or nyaayamurti keem joseph kii teen sadasyeey peeth ne apane 44 pej ke faisle main verma ko unki shaktiyon se vanchit karne or sanyukt nideshak em nageshwar raav ko sibiai kaa antarim nideshak banaae jane sambandhi sivisi or carmik evam prashikshan vibhaag (diopiti) ke 23 oktober, 2018 ke adeshon ko nirast kar diya
 The bench said in its judgment that we consider it appropriate to direct that CBI Director Verma will not take any major policy decision and refrain from doing so until the committee is allowed to take such action or decision on his reinstatement
 yah faisla pradhan nyaayadhish ne likhaa, lekin chunki aaj vah upasthit nahin the isliye nyaayamurti kaul ne yah nirnay sunaaya
 Along with this, the court in its judgment also asked the High Powered Committee consisting of Prime Minister, Chief Justice and Leader of Opposition (leader of the largest opposition party in Lok Sabha) to meet within a week
 ucchadhikaar praapt chayan samiti ke faisle ke aadhaar par verma ko 19 janvari 2017 ko do saal ke liye sibiai nideshak ke pad par niyukt kiya gaya tha
 British Prime Minister David Cameron said he congratulated Narendra Modi for winning by more votes than any leader in the universe
 camran ne kaha, ‘main chunaav main jeet ke baad pradhanmantri modi ko badhai dene ke dauraan hui baatcheet ko nahin bhuluungaa

 He was speaking at an annual event organized by Conservative Friends of India
 british pradhanmantri ne kaha, ‘britain or bharat ke yahaan ab sudhaaron ko lekar kadam uthaane vaali saahasik sarkare hai jo mukt upkram or pragati main vishwaas karti hai

 The police driver was also killed in the blast

 You have heard many times from the mouths of elders, do not sweep at night, do not touch basil and many other things
 par kya aapako yah maaloom he ki aisa aakhir kyon kaha jaataa he
 Today we are going to cover the same mystery
 aaiye jaanate hai
 
 
 People do not touch in the evening, during Tulsi Sham, people light a lamp in front of Tulsi, offer it, but do not touch it nor offer water to it
 shaam ko tulsi ke saamne deep jalaane se lakshmi ji kii krupa hoti he
 But if you touch Tulsi or burn them in the evening, then they are offended
 is tarah lakshmi ji rusht ho jaati hai
 She does not grace herself
 darasal, aisi manyata he ki shaam ke samay tulsi ji aaraam karti hai or chune se wo jag jaati hai
 Due to sleep disturbances, she berates the devotee with her blessings
 vaigyanik bhi maanate hai ki raat ke samay paudhon ko pani nahin dena chahie
 Plants also have time to sleep and wake up
 aise main yadi aap unhen raat main pani denge to unki sehat kharaab ho sakati he or wo murjhaa sakate hai
 If you keep these 7 things in the purse, then it will not rain the mercy of mother Lakshmi, even after forgetting the broom, you should not sweep the house after the sun sets
 darasal, aisi manyata he ki shaam ke vakt jhaadu lagane se lakshmi ji ghar ke baahar chali jaati hai
 One reason is that there was no electricity in the olden days
 suraj duubate hi laalaten yaa diye kii roshni main log kaam karte the
 In such a situation, while sweeping in the dark, many times the necessary things also went out into the garbage
 isliye bhi ise niyam ke taur par mana jane laga ki andhera hote hi yaa din dhalane ke baad jhaadoo nahin lagaana chahie
 Dhanavarsha is done by ringing a bell in the temple, learn and what are the benefits
 
 
 guuruuvaar ko kyon nahin karte shavingviravaar ko aamtaur par log bal or dadhi nahin banavaate
 People do not make this mistake on Thursday
 darasal, guuruuvaar ko brihaspati yani ki devataaon ke guru kaa din mana jaataa he
 It is believed that Jupiter is a factor of luck
 aise main yah manyata he ki guuruuvaar ko jo log bal kataate hai or shaving karte hai, unka bhagya kharaab ho jaataa he
 Mahamrityunjaya Mantra is hidden in the solution of every problem
 Nails are not cut at night
 One reason behind this is that earlier there was no electricity and cutting nails in the dark was a risky task
 iske alaava logon ke paas tab nelkator bhi nahin hua karte the, wo chaaku, blade yaa kanchi se nakhun katate the
 Secondly, its religious aspect is that Lakshmi ji is annoyed by nail biting at night
 unhen raat main nakhun kaatna bilkul pasand nahin he
 Lakshmi does not show her grace on such person and she also suffers loss of money
 shanidev ko mila tha patni se shraap, jaane kya he isaki katha
