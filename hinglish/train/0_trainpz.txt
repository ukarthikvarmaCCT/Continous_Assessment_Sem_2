 com / Cni9wz5dwg — Nawazuddin Siddiqui (@nawazuddin_s) July 18, 2018 petrol kii keemat bhale hi tel companiyaan tay karti hai, lekin un par tex lagane kaa adhikaar sarkaar ke paas hota he
 At the same time, due to VAT on petrol, there is a huge difference in the prices of petrol in different states
 aise main sabase sasta petrol khareednaa he to aapako andaman kii yatra kerani pad sakati he
 The highest price of petrol is around Rs 80 in Mumbai
 vahiin andaman main petrol kii keemat sabase kam he
 Petrol price 60 in Port Blair (andaman and Nicobar)
 80 rupee he
 There is a difference of Rs 20 per liter in petrol prices in the country between these states
 goa main bhi petrol kii keemat 65 rupee ke kareeb he
 States in the North East have lower VAT on petrol and diesel than other states
 arunachal main petrol par 20 fisadi or dijal par 12
 5% VAT
 tripura main petrol par 20 to dijal par 13
 5% VAT
 meghalaya, nagaland or mizoram main bhi waite kii daren kaaphi kam hai
 Therefore petrol and diesel prices in these states are lower than in other states
 isliye hota he antarpetrol or dijal par lagane vaala exise duty to fiks he
 Where this 21 on petrol
 48 rupee he to dijal par 17
 33 is Rs
 modi sarkaar november 2014 se ab tak petrol ke exise duty main 126 pratishat or dijal ke exise duty main 374 pratishat kii badhotaree kar chuki he
 Despite this, the states have a real role in the pricing of petrol and diesel
 jin rajyon main petrol par lagane vaala waite adhik hota he, vahaan petrol kii keemat sabase zyada hoti he
 Let us tell you that Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Telangana are the states where VAT on petrol is up to 35 percent
 vahiin kerala main 34 pratishat waite lagata he
 At the same time, in states, Goa charges only 17 percent VAT
 arunachal pradesh, mizoram, tripura main waite lagbhag 20 pratishat ke aasapaas he
 In the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, only 6 percent VAT rate is applicable by the Center on petrol
 ise aise samajhedilli main dijal par dealer prise 30
 19 rupees, 17 on that
 33 rupee kaa exise tex lagata he
 Also 2
 50 rupee dealer kamishan hota he
 In such a situation, the distributors of Delhi have to pay 50 rupees for diesel
 vahiin ab 27 pratishat waite lagane ke baad dijal kii keemat lagbhag 59 rupee baithti he
 30 at the dealer depot there
 48 rupee prati litre charge hone vaala petrol tex lagane ke baad lagbhag 231 pratishat kii badhotaree ke saath customers ko 70
 Get 52 rupees
 jiesti lagane ke baad yah badlaavapetroleum mantridhamendra pradhanne suzav diya he kipetrol or dejalpar bhi jiesti lage
 However states have opposed this
 yahi vajah he ki jiesti council ne petrol or dijal ko jiesti se baahar rakhaa he
 Speaking on the increase in petrol prices, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley attacked the opposition on this issue
 unke anusaar un rajyon main jahaan congress or communist partiyaan hai, kya vah petrol se waite hataane kaa kadam uthaa sakati hai? jetali ne aage kaha ki kisi bhi desh ko chalaane ke liye revenue kii jarurat hoti he
 In such a situation, if petrol and diesel are brought under GST, then many states may see a huge drop in their prices
 vahiin kuch rajyon main isaki keemat main oochaal bhi dekhne ko milegaa
 In such a situation, if the highest GST rate is 28 percent, then the price of petrol in Mumbai will be around 69 rupees per liter, which will be less than 10 rupees from the current rate
 vahiin andaman main isaki keemton main 13 rupee kaa oochaal dekhne ko milegaa
 At the same time, the price of petrol will increase in all North East states
 sarkaar ko mil rahaa phaaydarajyon ko milane vaale waite main badhotaree dekhi gai he
 This 1 of 2015-16
 42 lakh karod ke mukaable 16 pratishat kii badhotaree ke saath 2016-17 main 1
 66 lakhs
 vahiin exise duty main to 35 pratishat kii badhotaree dekhi gai
 1 of 2015-16
 78 lakh karod rupee se badhkar yah 2016-17 main 2
 42 lakh crores
 yah chijen centre or rajyon donon ko khush kar rahi he
 Another argument on the price of petrol and diesel is that when the oil companies were facing losses for many years, now if they are benefiting and the government is also earning, then what is wrong with that? aankadon ke mutabik tel companiyon ko 2002 se 2013 ke bich 25,000 karod or 3
 There is a loss of Rs 38 lakh crore on diesel

 aise logon ko bakhsha nahin jayega or unhen santhaan main padhai jari rakhane kaa anumati nahin hogi
 Also, according to the law, they will be punished by taking strict action against them

 Rajasthan has a total of 200 seats, out of which elections were held in 199 seats
 ek ummidavaar kii maut ho jane ke kaaran 1 seat par matdaan nahin karaayaa ja sakaa tha
 According to the latest data, the Congress and its allies are leading in 98 seats
 vahiin, bijepi 75 siton par aage chal rahi he
 In Rajasthan, independents and small parties candidates are leading in 26 seats, so that it is decided that all the votes which are angry with BJP have not been transferred to Congress
 agar aisa hota to congress ko prachand bahumat mil saktaa tha
 Secondly, speculations were being made that bjp's sweep in Rajasthan would be cleaned, it is not seen as it happens
 rujhaanon ko dekhakar to aisa lag rahaa he ki agar party ne vasundhara kaa saath diya hota to tasviir thodi or behatar hoti
 Modi kept talking about Congress, Rahul, Neem coated urea in his public meetings, but kept avoiding Vasundhara's name
 amit shah ne to bhare manch se kah diya tha ki vasundhara aapane kaam kiya he, lekin apana kaam bataa nahin pain
 The Congress may be getting more seats in Rajasthan, but there is a slight difference in the vote percentage of both
 congress ko 39
 The BJP has got 2 percent votes while the BJP has 38
 8 fisadi vot mili hai
 Then what are the reasons for the possible defeat of BJP? Vasundhara Raje and BJP have tried to keep their vote bank (jat, Gurjar and Rajput) in Rajasthan in every way in last four years
 par yah teenon hi jatiyaan (jo rajasthan kii aabaadi main kariban 20 fisadi hai or jinka asar padosi rajyon haryana or madhya pradesh main bhi he) bhaajapa se naaraaz hai
 With the arrival of Sachin Pilot, the Gurjar community is also turning away from the BJP
 jatakamarwar kshetra samet rajya ke 100 vidhansabha siton par jaaton kaa asar he
 This community is angry with BJP because they have no special place in the party
 kisaan hone kii vajah se krishi sankat bhi ek sabab he
 There was also resentment in the community for getting less attention than Rajputs
 rajputahyah samudaay amuman bhaajapa kaa vafaadaar rahaa he
 In every assembly, 15-17 Rajputs have been elected as mlas on BJP tickets
 2013 main kul 27 rajput vidhayakon main se 24 bhaajapa se the
 But there is uneasiness in this caste as cases were made against Rajput leaders
 gangster anandapal kii muthbhed main maut ke baad bhi is samudaay main rosh he or karani sena padmavat masale ke baad se sarkaar se naaraaz he
 Rajputs are also in conflict with Jats
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa rahe jaswant singh kii upeksha or maanavendra singh kaa congress main janaa bhi bada factor he
 The Rajput community is present in about 100 assembly seats
 gurjarah50 siton par is samudaay kii maujuudagi he
 Gujjar was angry with the BJP over the reservation issue
 police firing or aapasi sangharsh main 2007 ke baad se 70 se adhik gujars maare gaye hai
 The prospect of Sachin Pilot as a future chief minister was seen to increase his inclination towards the Congress in the election campaign
 in saare factor bhaajapa kii sambhaavnaaon main palitha lagane vaale sabit hue hai

 duusare chunavi kshetra madhya rajasthan main bhi teen ilaake hai

 isamen 17 siten hai or congress banaam bhaajapa ke sidhi takkar vaali 13 siten hai, 4 siten bahukoniya mukaable vaali rahi hai
 But the BJP is seen winning 9 and Congress 8 seats
 yani baaki ko kone vaali partiyon ko kuch khaas hasil nahin hua he
 The third electoral area is southern Rajasthan, also known as Mewar
 yah ilaaka har paanch saal par janadesh badal detaa he
 It is believed that the party that wins Mewar forms the government
 khaskar salumbar seat khaas saliye he kyonki 1977 se jo party yah seat jitati he sarkaar usee kii banati ai he
 Mewar has 7 districts and 35 seats
 inamen udaipur, dungarpur, bhilwara, rajsamand, chittorgarh, pratapgarh, bansawada ke ilaake hai

 The area of western Rajasthan belongs to veteran Congress leader Ashok Gehlot
 yahaan kisi teesri siyaasi party kaa koi vajood nahin he
 a total of 43 seats are in this area, of which 33 seats were in direct competition
 is ilaake main obisi or jat vot behad nirnaayak hote hai
 Apart from this, votes of Meghwal, Rajpurohit and Rajputs are also important
 is ilaake ke tahat jodhpur, jaisalmer, barmer, nagaur, jalaur, paali or sirohi jile aate hai
 In 2008, BJP got 19 seats and Congress 20 seats
 anya ko 4 siten hasil hui thim
 But this time in 2018, BJP is getting 15 seats, Congress 26 and others 3 seats
 uttari rajasthan main shekhavati or bikaner do jone hai
 Shekhawati has Sikar, Jhunjhunu and Churu districts with 21 seats
 is jone main congress ko 14, bhaajapa ko 5 or anya ko 2 siten milti dikh rahi hai
 Bikaner zone has a total of 18 seats in Bikaner, Ganganagar and Hanumangarh districts
 yahaan bhaajapa ko 9, congress ko 6 or anya ko 2 siten milti dikh rahi hai
 The Jat vote bank of this area had an inclination towards the Congress, while the Rajputs usually vote for the BJP
 vaise, rajasthan main ab bahes yah he ki mukhyamantri ashok gahalot banenge yaa sachin payalat, lekin congress ke andruni sutron ke mutabik, siton kii sankhya ke maddenjar jaadugar kahe jane vaale gahalot ko hi kamaani saunpi ja sakati he

 adwani ne modi kaa naam liye bina bhaajapa adhyaksh ko likhe patr main is mahatvapurn baithak main nahin aane ke sambandh main kaha, dopaher main maine aapse kaha tha ki main vichaar karuunga ki mujhe apni baat sansadeey board ke sadasyon ke saamne rakhni he yaa nahin
 Now i have decided that it would be better that i do not attend today's meeting
 tippaniyan Modi, while expressing his gratitude to the party for becoming the Prime Ministerial candidate, gave the slogan of 'new thinking, new hope' and said that he will be able to fight for 'bjp's good governance and development' against 'UPA corruption and price rise' in the election

 unhone kaha ki rajg ke sahyogi dalon ke netaaon ne bhaajapa kaa pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banane par unhen badhai di he
 Amid the conch and the sound of bells played by party workers at the press conference, Modi said, "I will try to live up to the general human aspirations and expectations of the activists
" unhone kaha, main deshavaasiyon se bhi aashirwad chahta hum ki desh is samay jis sankat kii ghadi se guzar rahaa he, usase nikaalane kaa mujhe samarthy de
 This was announced by BJP President Rajnath Singh after the party's parliamentary party meeting in New Delhi
 haalanki tamaam prayaason ke baad bhi adwani is baithak main nahin aae
 Sushma Swaraj and Murali Manohan Joshi were also opposed to making Modi the prime ministerial candidate, but eventually succumbed to the party's majority line

 After being declared the prime ministerial candidate, Modi said in an interaction with the pollsters, "I assure the BJP that the party will win in the Lok Sabha elections, i will not put any hard work and no shortage for it
" unhone yah aashwaasan bhi diya ki vah 'saamaanya maanviya aakankshaon' par bhi khare utrenge
 Modi's name was announced as a candidate for the Prime Minister of the BJP in a very bitter atmosphere in the party

 Modi, who is going to be 63 years old on Tuesday, went to meet Advani at his residence after his coronation
 modi adwani ke nivas par aadha ghanta rahe

 All other members of the 12-member parliamentary board including Sushma Swaraj, Murali Manohar Joshi, Arun Jaitley, Nitin Gadkari, Venkaiah Naidu and Ananth Kumar were present, except former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and angry Advani due to ill-health at the meeting

 He also assured that he will also live up to 'common human aspirations'

 On the one hand, Modi's name was announced, on the other hand Advani's letter to Rajnath Singh came out, in which the senior leader expressed his anguish over the party's modalities in the context of this decision
 mangalvaar ko 63 saal ke hone ja rahe modi apni tajposhi ke baad adwani se milane unke nivas par gaye

 The Supreme Court will hear the government's plea to allow the Aadhaar card to be applied as a proof of identity in many public welfare schemes, including providing subsidies for LPG gas cylinders
 supreme court ke chif justise pi sadashivam kii adhyakshata vaali peeth ne kaha ki vah aath oktober ko sarkaar kii yachika par sunwaayee karegi
 Solicitor General Mohan Parasharan presented the case before the court on Friday
 iske pehle court ne aadesh diya tha ki kai sarkari yojanaon main laabh hasil karne ke liye aadhaar card aavashyak nahin he
 These schemes also include the National Food Security Act
 bijli gul hote hi zindagi tham jaati he, kyonki garmi kii maar se raahat dilaate cooler-asi, andhere se bachaati battiyaan, chamchamaate mal se lekar dhadadhad maal taiyaar karti factoriyaan - sab bijli kaa khel he
 
 
 But electricity will be available only when it is made
 
 
 aisa kyon he
 
 
 Actually, two-thirds of the country's electricity is made of coal, but what will they do when power plants do not have coal
 
 
 isiilie, inamen se kai band ho chuke hai, or kuch band hone kii kagaar par hai
 
 
 The report of the Central Electricity Authority, which monitors 89 selected key power plants in the country, is shocking, according to which figures as of June 19 this year show that 23 power plants in the country now have less than four days Coal stock is left
 
 
 iske alaava 33 anya power plants ke paas saat din se kam koyale kaa stock bachaa he
 
 
 So, this means that even 56 big power plants of the country do not have the necessary coal to run a week
 
 
 is mudde par enditivi se khaas baatcheet main koyala mantri shriprakash jaiswal ne mana ki koyale kii kami he, lekin vah iske liye mukhya taur par power companiyon ko hi zimmedaar maanate hai
 
 
 He said, many plants are so old that they are consuming 25 percent more coal than necessary, and many plants had to use 20 percent imported coal, but they did not do so, because they are getting cheaper coal here
 , And they want to run from it
 
 
 inhen plants kii vajah se koyale kii kami he, lekin koi apni kami nahin bataata he
 
 
 The special thing is that earlier where power companies used to keep in stock for at least three weeks, the situation has become worse from now on
 
 
 in baton kii khabar aam logon ko tab lagati he, jab bade-chote shaharon main garmiyon ke dauraan power cat or lod sheding ke rup main bijli kii baari killat saamne aati he
 
 
 In the Prime Minister's Office, Minister of State v Narayanasamy also confessed in conversation with NDTV that the demand-supply fuse of electricity has blown
 
 
 unhone kaha, demand bahut bad gai he, or demand−supplai ke gap ko thik kiya ja rahaa he
 
 
 The PM has constituted a committee headed by the Principal Secretary, and the government is trying
 
 
 haalanki beete kuch maheenon main piemo ne kai baar dakhsandaji kii he, lekin koyale kii kami kaa marz jaadu kii chadi ghumaakar chhomantar nahin ho saktaa
 
 
 And as a result, companies facing coal shortage have failed to generate electricity as needed
 
 
 association of power producers ke diji ashok khurana kehete hai, koyale se kul 1,02,000 megawatt bijli kii paidaa karne kii kshamta he, lekin 30,000 se 35,000 megawatt buree tarah prabhavit he
 
 
 That is, more than 30 plants are not getting coal
 
 
 vaise iskaa doosraa pahalu bhi he, jisamen sabase mahatvapurn sawaal ubharta he ki band power plant ke band hone kii naubat kyon ai, or unhen koyala kyunnahin mil rahaa he
 
 
 According to the Central Electricity Authority, today the situation has become so bad that 37,092 MW of power is being reduced due to coal shortage, because not only many plants have been shut down, but the government is trying to meet the increasing power shortage by creating new plants
 The plan of the project is also in a mess
 
 
 darasal, sachai saamne ai koyala mantri shriprakash jaiswal se enditivi kii khaas baatcheet main, jab unhone kaha, kisi bhi kol mine ko chaar se chah saal lag jate hai, clearence milane main hi, or phir kahin jaakar kol blaak oparative ho paata he
 
 
 According to DG Ashok Khurana of the Association of Power Producers, due to coal shortage, the plants started after 2009 - Aravali plant of Delhi, Jhajjar and Yamunanagar plants near the capital - have to be closed
 
 
 
 
 
 So is the government's decision-making policy responsible for this, which is being called policy paralysis
 
 
 yah sawaal isliye bhi ahm he ki planton tak koyala isliye nahin pahunchaa, kyonki nai koyala khadaanon main kanoonee adchanon kii vajah se kaam shuru nahin ho sakaa
 
 
 According to the Coal Ministry, by the end of April this year, 15 proposals of Coal India Limited were stuck due to delay in the approval of the Ministry of Environment and State Governments, a total of 48 coal mines were rejected due to non-clearance of environment clearance
 And because of lack of forest clearance, it was difficult to move forward on the proposal of 180 coal mines
 
 
 ab sieji kii jaanch ne rahi−sahi kasar bhi puri kar di
 
 
 Government officials are nervous about taking decisions after allegations of scam in allocation of coal blocks
 
 
 kanoon mantri salmaan khurshid ne enditivi se baatcheet main kaha, ek taraf kaha jaataa he ki aap jaldbaazi main faisle le rahe hai, vahiin yah bhi aarope lagaaya jaataa he ki aap nirnay nahin le paa rahe hai
 
 
 The comments ab zaruri koyala muhaiyaa karaane main sarkaar kii naakaami ke baad videsh se koyala aayaat karne kii maang uthne lagi he
 
 
 Power companies are arguing that in the current situation it is not possible to overcome the shortage in the country through the existing resources, so the government should think seriously about importing bulk, because it is very expensive for private power companies to import coal themselves
 The deal will be proved
 
 
 ashok khurana ke mutabik piemo koshish kar rahaa he, lekin use bahut jald kargar kadam uthaane honge, kyonki koyala banane main, taiyaar hone main teen saal tak lag jate hai, isliye us samay tak kii zarurat ke liye koyale kaa aayaat to karnaa hi padegaa
 
 
 But if the government goes ahead on the option of importing coal, it will be difficult to supply electricity at the current rate, because coal coming from abroad will be expensive
 
 
 to kya aise main aam aadmi kaa bijli bill or mahangaa karnaa ek vikalp he
 
 
 Why is this
 
 
 darasal, desh kii do-tihaai bijli koyale se banati he, lekin jab power plants ke paas koyala hi nahin hoga to ve kya karenge
 
 
 Therefore, many of these have been closed, and some are on the verge of closure
 
 
 desh ke 89 chune hue ahm power plants kii monitoring karne vaali central electricity athurity kii vah report hilaa dene vaali he, jiske mutabik is saal 19 june tak ke aankade bataate hai ki desh ke 23 power plants ke paas ab chaar din se bhi kam ke liye koyale kaa stock bachaa he
 
 
 In addition, 33 other power plants have less than seven days of coal stock
 
 
 so, iskaa matlab hua ki desh ke 56 bade power plants ko ek hafte chalaane ke liye bhi jaruri koyale kaa jugad nahin he
 
 
 In a special conversation with NDTV on this issue, Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal admitted that there is a shortage of coal, but he mainly considers the power companies responsible for this
 
 
 unhone kaha, bahut saare plant itane puraane hai ki vah zarurat se 25 fisadi zyada koyala kha rahe hai, or bahut-se plants ko 20 fisadi aaayaatit koyale kaa istemaal karnaa tha, lekin unhone aisa nahin kiya, kyonki unhen yahaan sasta koyala mil rahaa he, or ve isi se kaam chalaanaa chaahate hai
 
 
 Due to these plants there is a shortage of coal, but no one explains its shortage
 
 
 khaas baat yah he ki pehle power companiyaan stock main jahaan kam se kam teen hafte kaa intjaam rakhti thim, vahiin halaat ab bad se badtar ho chuke hai
 
 
 The news of these things to the common people comes when the power shortage and load shedding in the big cities in the form of heavy heat is encountered during the summer
 
 
 pradhanmantri karyaalay main rajyamantri ve narayansami ne bhi enditivi se baatcheet main kabool kiya ki bijli kii demand−supplai kaa fus ud gaya he
 
 
 He said, demand has increased a lot, and the demand-supply gap is being rectified
 
 
 piem ne pradhan sachiv kii adhyakshata main cameti gathit kii he, or sarkaar koshish kar rahi he
 
 
 Although the PMO has interfered several times in the last few months, the lack of coal cannot be lost by turning the magic wand
 
 
 or parinamswaroop koyale kii killat se juujhati companiyaan jarurat bhar bijli paidaa karne main naakaam rahi hai
 
 
 According to Ashok Khurana, DG of the Association of Power Producers, coal has a total generating capacity of 1,02,000 MW, but 30,000 to 35,000 MW is badly affected
 
 
 yani 30 se zyada plants ko koyala mil hi nahin paa rahaa he
 
 
 However, there is another aspect of this, in which the most important question arises as to why the closure of the closed power plant, and why they are not getting coal
 
 
 central electricity athurity ke mutabik aaj halaat itane kharaab ho chuke hai ki koyale kii kami kii vajah se 37,092 megawatt bijli kam ban rahi he, kyonki na sirf kai plant band ho chuke hai, balki nae plant banaakar bijli kii badhati kami ko puraa karne kii sarkaar kii yojana bhi khatai main pad chuki he
 
 
 Actually, the truth came to light in a special conversation of NDTV with Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal, when he said, it takes four to six years for any coal mine, only to get clearance, and then the coal block becomes operative
 
 
 association of power producers ke diji ashok khurana ke mutabik koyale kii kami kii vajah se varsh 2009 ke baad shuru kiye gaye plants - jaise dilli kaa aravali plant, rajdhani ke nazadik hi bane jhajjar or yamunanagar plants - ko band karnaa padaa he
 
 
 
 
 
 to kya iske liye sarkaar kii faisle na lene kii niti jimmedaar he, jise policy paralysis kaha ja rahaa he
 
 
 This question is also important because coal did not reach the plants because the work could not start due to legal hurdles in the new coal mines
 
 
 koyala mantralay ke mutabik, is saal april ke ant tak kol india limited ke 15 prastaav paryaavaran mantralay or rajya sarkaron kii manzuri main deree kii vajah se atake hue the, paryaavaran clearence na milane kii vajah se kul 48 koyala khadaanon ke prastaav latake pade the, or forestry clearence na milane kii vajah se 180 koyala khadaanon ke prastaav par aage badhanaa mushkil ho rahaa tha
 
 
 Now the CAG investigation has also completed the task
 
 
 kol blox ke aavanton main ghotaale ke aarope ke baad sarkari adhikari faisle lene se ghabara rahe hai
 
 
 Law Minister Salman Khurshid said in a conversation with NDTV, on one hand it is said that you are taking decisions in haste, while on the other hand it is alleged that you are not taking the decision
 
 
 tippaniyan Now after the government's failure to provide the necessary coal, the demand for importing coal from abroad has started to arise
 
 
 power companiyaan daleel de rahi hai ki maujuuda paristhiti main desh main maujuuda sansadhano ke jariye kami ko dur karnaa sambhav nahin he, isliye sarkaar ko balk emport karne ke bare main gambhirtha se sochna chahie, kyonki nijee power companiyon ke liye khud koyala aayaat karnaa behad mahangaa sauda sabit hoga
 
 
 According to Ashok Khurana, the PMO is trying, but it will have to take effective steps very soon, because it takes up to three years for coal to be prepared, so for that time, the coal needs to be imported
 
 
 lekin koyala aayaat karne ke vikalp par agar sarkaar aage badhati he to isse maujuuda dar par bijli supplai karnaa mushkil hoga, kyonki videsh se aane vaala koyala mahangaa hoga
 
 
 So, in such a situation, making the electricity bill of the common man more expensive is an option
 
 
 desh ke 89 chune hue ahm power plants kii monitoring karne vaali central electricity athurity kii vah report hilaa dene vaali he, jiske mutabik is saal 19 june tak ke aankade bataate hai ki desh ke 23 power plants ke paas ab chaar din se bhi kam ke liye koyale kaa stock bachaa he

 power companiyaan daleel de rahi hai ki maujuuda paristhiti main desh main maujuuda sansadhano ke jariye kami ko dur karnaa sambhav nahin he, isliye sarkaar ko balk emport karne ke bare main gambhirtha se sochna chahie, kyonki nijee power companiyon ke liye khud koyala aayaat karnaa behad mahangaa sauda sabit hoga
 
 
 According to Ashok Khurana, the PMO is trying, but it will have to take effective steps very soon, because it takes up to three years for coal to be prepared, so for that time, the coal needs to be imported
 
 
 lekin koyala aayaat karne ke vikalp par agar sarkaar aage badhati he to isse maujuuda dar par bijli supplai karnaa mushkil hoga, kyonki videsh se aane vaala koyala mahangaa hoga
 
 
 So, in such a situation, making the electricity bill of the common man more expensive is an option
 
 
 is mudde par enditivi se khaas baatcheet main koyala mantri shriprakash jaiswal ne mana ki koyale kii kami he, lekin vah iske liye mukhya taur par power companiyon ko hi zimmedaar maanate hai
 
 
 He said, many plants are so old that they are consuming 25 percent more coal than necessary, and many plants had to use 20 percent imported coal, but they did not do so, because they are getting cheaper coal here
 , And they want to run from it
 
 
 inhen plants kii vajah se koyale kii kami he, lekin koi apni kami nahin bataata he
 
 
 The special thing is that earlier where power companies used to keep in stock for at least three weeks, the situation has become worse from now on
 
 
 in baton kii khabar aam logon ko tab lagati he, jab bade-chote shaharon main garmiyon ke dauraan power cat or lod sheding ke rup main bijli kii baari killat saamne aati he
 
 
 In the Prime Minister's Office, Minister of State v Narayanasamy also confessed in conversation with NDTV that the demand-supply fuse of electricity has blown
 
 
 unhone kaha, demand bahut bad gai he, or demand−supplai ke gap ko thik kiya ja rahaa he
 
 
 The PM has constituted a committee headed by the Principal Secretary, and the government is trying
 
 
 haalanki beete kuch maheenon main piemo ne kai baar dakhsandaji kii he, lekin koyale kii kami kaa marz jaadu kii chadi ghumaakar chhomantar nahin ho saktaa
 
 
 And as a result, companies facing coal shortage have failed to generate electricity as needed
 
 
 association of power producers ke diji ashok khurana kehete hai, koyale se kul 1,02,000 megawatt bijli kii paidaa karne kii kshamta he, lekin 30,000 se 35,000 megawatt buree tarah prabhavit he
 
 
 That is, more than 30 plants are not getting coal
 
 
 vaise iskaa doosraa pahalu bhi he, jisamen sabase mahatvapurn sawaal ubharta he ki band power plant ke band hone kii naubat kyon ai, or unhen koyala kyunnahin mil rahaa he
 
 
 According to the Central Electricity Authority, today the situation has become so bad that 37,092 MW of power is being reduced due to coal shortage, because not only many plants have been shut down, but the government is trying to meet the increasing power shortage by creating new plants
 The plan of the project is also in a mess
 
 
 darasal, sachai saamne ai koyala mantri shriprakash jaiswal se enditivi kii khaas baatcheet main, jab unhone kaha, kisi bhi kol mine ko chaar se chah saal lag jate hai, clearence milane main hi, or phir kahin jaakar kol blaak oparative ho paata he
 
 
 According to DG Ashok Khurana of the Association of Power Producers, due to coal shortage, the plants started after 2009 - Aravali plant of Delhi, Jhajjar and Yamunanagar plants near the capital - have to be closed
 
 
 
 
 
 So is the government's decision-making policy responsible for this, which is being called policy paralysis
 
 
 yah sawaal isliye bhi ahm he ki planton tak koyala isliye nahin pahunchaa, kyonki nai koyala khadaanon main kanoonee adchanon kii vajah se kaam shuru nahin ho sakaa
 
 
 According to the Coal Ministry, by the end of April this year, 15 proposals of Coal India Limited were stuck due to delay in the approval of the Ministry of Environment and State Governments, a total of 48 coal mines were rejected due to non-clearance of environment clearance
 And because of lack of forest clearance, it was difficult to move forward on the proposal of 180 coal mines
 
 
 ab sieji kii jaanch ne rahi−sahi kasar bhi puri kar di
 
 
 Government officials are nervous about taking decisions after allegations of scam in allocation of coal blocks
 
 
 kanoon mantri salmaan khurshid ne enditivi se baatcheet main kaha, ek taraf kaha jaataa he ki aap jaldbaazi main faisle le rahe hai, vahiin yah bhi aarope lagaaya jaataa he ki aap nirnay nahin le paa rahe hai
 
 
 The comments ab zaruri koyala muhaiyaa karaane main sarkaar kii naakaami ke baad videsh se koyala aayaat karne kii maang uthne lagi he
 
 
 Power companies are arguing that in the current situation it is not possible to overcome the shortage in the country through the existing resources, so the government should think seriously about importing bulk, because it is very expensive for private power companies to import coal themselves
 The deal will be proved
 
 
 ashok khurana ke mutabik piemo koshish kar rahaa he, lekin use bahut jald kargar kadam uthaane honge, kyonki koyala banane main, taiyaar hone main teen saal tak lag jate hai, isliye us samay tak kii zarurat ke liye koyale kaa aayaat to karnaa hi padegaa
 
 
 But if the government goes ahead on the option of importing coal, it will be difficult to supply electricity at the current rate, because coal coming from abroad will be expensive
 
 
 to kya aise main aam aadmi kaa bijli bill or mahangaa karnaa ek vikalp he

 But if the government goes ahead on the option of importing coal, it will be difficult to supply electricity at the current rate, because coal coming from abroad will be expensive
 
 
 to kya aise main aam aadmi kaa bijli bill or mahangaa karnaa ek vikalp he
 
 
 Although the PMO has interfered several times in the last few months, the lack of coal cannot be lost by turning the magic wand
 
 
 or parinamswaroop koyale kii killat se juujhati companiyaan jarurat bhar bijli paidaa karne main naakaam rahi hai
 
 
 According to Ashok Khurana, DG of the Association of Power Producers, coal has a total generating capacity of 1,02,000 MW, but 30,000 to 35,000 MW is badly affected
 
 
 yani 30 se zyada plants ko koyala mil hi nahin paa rahaa he
 
 
 However, there is another aspect of this, in which the most important question arises as to why the closure of the closed power plant, and why they are not getting coal
 
 
 central electricity athurity ke mutabik aaj halaat itane kharaab ho chuke hai ki koyale kii kami kii vajah se 37,092 megawatt bijli kam ban rahi he, kyonki na sirf kai plant band ho chuke hai, balki nae plant banaakar bijli kii badhati kami ko puraa karne kii sarkaar kii yojana bhi khatai main pad chuki he
 
 
 Actually, the truth came to light in a special conversation of NDTV with Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal, when he said, it takes four to six years for any coal mine, only to get clearance, and then the coal block becomes operative
 
 
 association of power producers ke diji ashok khurana ke mutabik koyale kii kami kii vajah se varsh 2009 ke baad shuru kiye gaye plants - jaise dilli kaa aravali plant, rajdhani ke nazadik hi bane jhajjar or yamunanagar plants - ko band karnaa padaa he
 
 
 
 
 
 to kya iske liye sarkaar kii faisle na lene kii niti jimmedaar he, jise policy paralysis kaha ja rahaa he
 
 
 This question is also important because coal did not reach the plants because the work could not start due to legal hurdles in the new coal mines
 
 
 koyala mantralay ke mutabik, is saal april ke ant tak kol india limited ke 15 prastaav paryaavaran mantralay or rajya sarkaron kii manzuri main deree kii vajah se atake hue the, paryaavaran clearence na milane kii vajah se kul 48 koyala khadaanon ke prastaav latake pade the, or forestry clearence na milane kii vajah se 180 koyala khadaanon ke prastaav par aage badhanaa mushkil ho rahaa tha
 
 
 Now the CAG investigation has also completed the task
 
 
 kol blox ke aavanton main ghotaale ke aarope ke baad sarkari adhikari faisle lene se ghabara rahe hai
 
 
 Law Minister Salman Khurshid said in a conversation with NDTV, on one hand it is said that you are taking decisions in haste, while on the other hand it is alleged that you are not taking the decision

 Power companies are arguing that in the current situation it is not possible to overcome the shortage in the country through the existing resources, so the government should think seriously about importing bulk, because it is very expensive for private power companies to import coal themselves
 The deal will be proved
 
 
 ashok khurana ke mutabik piemo koshish kar rahaa he, lekin use bahut jald kargar kadam uthaane honge, kyonki koyala banane main, taiyaar hone main teen saal tak lag jate hai, isliye us samay tak kii zarurat ke liye koyale kaa aayaat to karnaa hi padegaa
 
 
 But if the government goes ahead on the option of importing coal, it will be difficult to supply electricity at the current rate, because coal coming from abroad will be expensive
 
 
 to kya aise main aam aadmi kaa bijli bill or mahangaa karnaa ek vikalp he
 
 
 Now the CAG investigation has also completed the task

 Law Minister Salman Khurshid said in a conversation with NDTV, on one hand it is said that you are taking decisions in haste, while on the other hand it is alleged that you are not taking the decision
 
 
 tippaniyan Now after the government's failure to provide the necessary coal, the demand for importing coal from abroad has started to arise
 
 
 power companiyaan daleel de rahi hai ki maujuuda paristhiti main desh main maujuuda sansadhano ke jariye kami ko dur karnaa sambhav nahin he, isliye sarkaar ko balk emport karne ke bare main gambhirtha se sochna chahie, kyonki nijee power companiyon ke liye khud koyala aayaat karnaa behad mahangaa sauda sabit hoga
 
 
 According to Ashok Khurana, the PMO is trying, but it will have to take effective steps very soon, because it takes up to three years for coal to be prepared, so for that time, the coal needs to be imported
 
 
 lekin koyala aayaat karne ke vikalp par agar sarkaar aage badhati he to isse maujuuda dar par bijli supplai karnaa mushkil hoga, kyonki videsh se aane vaala koyala mahangaa hoga
 
 
 So, in such a situation, making the electricity bill of the common man more expensive is an option
 
 
 ab zaruri koyala muhaiyaa karaane main sarkaar kii naakaami ke baad videsh se koyala aayaat karne kii maang uthne lagi he

 Pakistan's human rights minister Shirin Mazari has written a letter to UNICEF
 is patr main unhone kashmir mudde kaa hawala dete hue sadbhaavna doot ke taur par niyukt bollywood abhinetri priyanka chopra ko hataane kii maang kii he
 Mazari cited unicef's staunch nationalism and support of the Indian actress on the action taken by the Indian government in Jammu and Kashmir
 unicef ke kaaryakari nideshak henriketa for ko likhe ek patr main majaari ne kaha, "priyanka kaa parmaanu yuddh sahit yuddh ko samarthan karnaa sanyukt raashtra kii vishwasaneeyata ko kamjor karata he
 UNICEF should immediately remove Priyanka Chopra as its envoy
 nahin to shanti ke liye sadbhaavna doot jaisi niyuktiyaan vishvabhar main ek tamaasha banakar rah jaaengi
 "the water of this lake is rosy, photos are being seen repeatedly and VIDEO Majri has canceled the special status given to the state of Jammu and Kashmir by the Narendra Modi government and the ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Muslims there
 i also cited the crisis that grew in India
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki modi sarkaar purvottar bhartiya rajya assam main chalis lakh bhartiya musalamaanon ko unki naagarikta se vanchit kar rahi he
 Along with this, he alleged that the Indian security forces have intensified the use of pellet guns against women and children in Kashmir
 jis tarah se pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan bhartiya pradhanmantri par hindu varchasvvaadi or naslvaadi hone kaa aarope laga chuke hai, thik usee tarah majaari ne bhi apana bayaan diya he
 He said, " The entire policy of the BJP government is like the Nazi doctrine of ethnic cleansing, racism, fascism and genocide
 chopra ne saarvajanik rup se bharat sarkaar ke paksh kaa samarthan kiya he
 He has also endorsed the nuclear threat to Pakistan by the Indian Defense Minister
 "france ke videsh mantri ne pakistan se kaha- sanyam baraten or dwipaksheeya tareeke se sulajhaayen kashmir muddamjari ne bhartiya raksha mantri rajnath singh ke bayaan kaa zikr kiya, jisamen unhone parmaanu niti main 'no fasrt yuj' kii bharat kii patibaddhta ko bhavishya kii paristhitiyon ke adheen bataaya tha
 Mazari said, "retaining Chopra as a UN Goodwill Ambassador for peace is completely against the principles of peace and goodwill
 "majaari kii apil imran khan sarkaar kii un koshishon kaa hi hissaa he, jisamen ve chaahate hai ki kashmir ke liye vishesh darje ko radd karne ke faisle kii vaishvik samudaay dwaara kadi ninda kii jaae

 The central government has failed to meet the fiscal deficit target last year and that too during the current year 2018-19
 3 fisadi vittiya ghate ke lakshya paane main vifal hone kii taraf bad rahi he
 The failure in the current year is certain because the Central Government has not met the Centre's expectations of direct tax collection and earnings from GST
 in donon vifaltaaon ke baad sarkaar ke paas report card main laal nishaan se bachane ke liye sirf shortkat kaa sahaara bachataa he

 According to India Today editor Anshuman Tiwari, the revenue deficit during FY 2019-20 is 3 of GDP
 3 fisadi lakshya se kendra sarkaar apane antarim bajet main jahaan rajasav ko badha-chadha kar dikhaa sakati he vahiin apane kharch ko chhipaane kaa kaam kar sakati he
 Tiwari said that on three previous occasions, the central government has shown revenue to be about 600 bps (basis point) higher and expenditure 400 bps less
 ab yah 3
 May remain 5 percent
 Data Alert ! # Interimbudgetsoverstate revenue growth & understate expenditure growth
 The last three editions overestimated tax growth by 600 bps & underestimated spending growth by 400 bps
 Actual fiscal deficit for FY20 is likely to be 3

 - anshuman tiwari (@ anshuman1tiwari) January 29, 2019budget 2019: 5 years of Modi government, where it stands today after 5 years Found as a fall in oil prices
 is raahat ke chalate kendra sarkaar ke liye vittiya ghate par kaabo paanaa aasaan ho gaya
 At the same time, the government also got the chance to strengthen its economic programs through this huge savings
 lekin kaarykaal ke shuruyaat main ghaataa sanbhaalane main safal hone vaali modi sarkaar aage chalakar apane kharch ko lekar kahaan funs gai ki use bajet main nirdhaarit ghate ke lakshya ko aage badhanaa padaa
 Know five years of Modi government and fluctuations in financial losses
 kendra sarkaar ne 2003 main phiscal responsibility and bajet management act paarit kiya jo uske liye vittiya ghate ke lakshya ko nirdhaarit karne kaa kaam karata he
 Although governments fail to maintain the balance of spending and deficit, they have been altering the target of deficit set under this Act
 Budget 2019: aakhri varsh kisaanon ko modi sarkaar se kya hai ummiden?maujuuda kendra sarkaar ne bhi maujuuda act main pherbadal ke liye 2016 main enke singh kii adhyakshata main rivyuu cameti gathit kii jisase lakshya main ijapha kiya ja sake
 However, the committee set a fiscal deficit target of 3 per cent of GDP by 31 March 2020 and 2 for 2020-21
 8 fisadi or 2023 tak 2
 Set a target of 5 percent
 haalanki is samiti dwaara nirdhaarit vittiya ghate ke lakshya ko adhik bataate hue vitt mantri arun jetali ne bajet 2017 main 3
 Set a fiscal deficit target of 2 per cent
 is faisle ke liye kendra sarkaar kii aalochana bhi hui or aankadon ke mutabik bajet 2018 main sarkaar vittiya ghate ke is lakshya par bhi khari nahin utari
 The Central Government has given several reasons for this, which is important due to non-collection of revenue from GST and the rise in crude oil prices once again
 vahiin maujuuda varsh ke dauraan aam chunaavon ko dekhte hue bhi kendra sarkaar par loklubhaavan kharch karne kii ummid he
 How did Modi get the economy? In Chidambaram's last budget, the truth is hidden
 In his first budget speech, Jaitley targeted fiscal deficit for fiscal year 2014-15
 1 fisadi rakhte hue 2016-17 tak 3 fisadi karne kaa daawa kiya
 Significantly, the fiscal deficit in 2011-12 is 5
 7 fisadi ke sheersh par tha or purv kii upie sarkaar ke kaarykaal main 2012-13 main ise ghataakar 4
 8 per cent was levied
 2013-14 main vittiya ghate ko 4
 The Modi government was handed the command in May 2014, doing 5 per cent
 is lakshya par apni pehali bajet spich main jetali ne kaha ki purv vitt mantri pi
 Chidambaram has given him a tough target of financial losses
 vahiin 2015-16 ke bajet main jetali ne daawa kiya ki phiscal responsibility and bajet management act dwaara nirdhaarit lakshya ko do nahin teen varshon main praapt kar lenge
 Earlier, the government's exercise was to achieve this target of 3% by 2016-17
 lihaaja, vittiya ghate ko kaabo karne kaa nayaa lakshya dete hue jetali ne 2015-16 ke liye 3
 9 per cent, 3 for 2016-17
 5 fisadi or 2017-18 ke liye jidipi ke 3 fisadi ke vittiya ghate kaa lakshya nirdhaarit kiya
 Government is just 3 in this goal
 9 fisadi ke lakshya ko praapt kar saki
 In the Budget Speech of 2018-19 last year, the Finance Minister claimed to contain the fiscal deficit
 jetali ne kaha ki unke kaarykaal main ghate ko 2013-14 ke 4
 3 by 2017-18, lower than the 4 per cent level
 5 fisadi kar liya gaya he
 Government for the next financial year 2018-19 3
 3 fisadi ke vittiya ghate ke lakshya ko nirdhaarit kiya
 Now it is to be seen in the figures of the upcoming budget, how the central government describes its tenure towards controlling the fiscal deficit
 kya maujuuda vitt varsh ke dauraan phiscal responsibility and bajet management act ke suzav ke mutabik 3 fisadi se kam vittiya ghate kii ummid 2020 tak kii ja sakati he? The stock markets of the country saw tremendous boom on Thursday

 machhliyon ke bare main aam dharna yah he ki unamem dimag nahin hota or unhen dard mahasoos nahin hota
 But now a new study has revealed that the brain of fish is faster than us humans in many ways

 ' The Pakistan team will land here on Thursday with the intention of winning the league match of the Asia Cup cricket tournament against Sri Lanka struggling with injuries but it will also be a tough test for them in the tournament
 pakistan ne apane abhiyaan kii shuruuaat bangladesh ko haraakar kii, haalanki yah kareebi muqabla rahaa
 At the same time, the Sri Lankan team failed to cross the big target against India and had to face defeat
 bharat ke 304 ran ke lakshya ke jawaab main srilankai team 50 ran pehle hi simat gayi
 Although he was expected to click in sub continental conditions and his players can bat up to lower order but still Team 45
 1 over main 254 ran par simat gayi lekin pakistan ke bare main bhavishyavaanee nahin kii ja sakati or donon tiimon kaagaj par ek baraabar hi dikh rahi hai
 Although Pakistan's batting order is long and their team has an explosive cricketer like Shahid Afridi who has the ability to turn the match but his team has not been so consistent in terms of performance
 vah jis din acha khel rahaa ho to match kaa ruukh palat saktaa he lekin agle hi match main uskaa pradarshan kaaphi kharaab bhi ho jaataa he lekin pakistani team apni leg brake gendbaaji par nirbhar kar sakati he to hameshaa hi uske kaam aayi he
 The Pakistan openers scored well against Bangladesh but experienced middle-order players like Younis Khan and misbah-ul-haq were unsuccessful
 antarrashtriya str par kamjor team maane jane vaali mejabaan team ke khilaaf unki gendbaaji bhi prabhaavshaalee nahin rahi
 Umar Gul, who spearheaded the pace bowling, was expensive and would have to concentrate on his bowling as his form was crucial to the team's victory
 srilanka ko gendbaaji kii samasyaon se jujhna pad rahaa he
 Their bowling attack could not stop the Indians in the absence of Lasith Malinga and they lost a lot of runs in the opening match
 malinga ke match main vaapasi kii ummid he
 There are also concerns in batting
 captain mahela jayavardhane kaa out hone ke baad team lakshya kaa peechha nahin kar paayi
 Explosive batting Tillakaratne Dilshan will be instrumental in laying the foundation for a big score and the four-time champion team would like to perform aggressively despite a poor start in the tournament
 srilankai team ke khilaadi naunven number tak ballebaaji kar sakate hai lekin bharat ke khilaaf yah prayaas acha nahin rahaa
 Sri Lanka are also missing their two attacking all rounders Angelo Mathews and Thisara Perera who are out of the squad due to injury

 Let me tell you, martyr Ranjit Khalko became a martyr at the age of just 32 years
 shahid kii bahan ne bataaya ki jald hi ranjit kii shaadi hone vaali thi
 Ranjit was supposed to get married this time but Ranjit was martyred before that

 uttar pradesh main bijepi ko prachand bahumat milane ke baad yogi adityanath ne mukhyamantri pad kii shapath le lee he
 Mohsin Raza's name in the 44-member cabinet of Yogi Adityanath is going to catch everyone's attention
 adityanath ke mantrimandal main mohsin ko rajyamantri banaaya gaya he
 The absence of Pankaj Singh, son of Home Minister Rajnath Singh, in the Yogi Cabinet is shocking
 pankaj singh ko noida se vidhansabha kaa tikat milane ke baad se hi charchaa chal padi thi ki agar bijepi satta main aegi to ve mantri pad ke prabal daavedaar honge, lekin aisa nahin hua
 It is worth noting that in the 403 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, BJP did not give tickets to any Muslims, due to which they had to face the attacks of opponents
 bijepi or uske sahyogi dalon ke tikat par jitkar aae 325 vidhayakon main koi bhi musalmaan nahin he
 Even after this, Mohsin Raza is being included in Yogi Adityanath's cabinet
 vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle bijepi main shaamil hue mohsin raja purv cricketer hai
 BJP had made him a spokesperson, due to which he is often seen on TV channels keeping the bjp's side
 tippaniyan Mohsin Raza first came into the limelight when he put up a poster in support of BJP in 2013
 40 varshiya mohsin raja ne government jubilee inter college se padhai kii
 After this he obtained higher education from Lucknow University
 mantri pad sanbhaalane ke baad mohsin raja ko chah maheene ke andar vidhansabha yaa vidhaan parishad kii sadsyta hasil kerani hogi
 It is known that Uttar Pradesh has around 19 per cent Muslim population
 yahaan gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki 403 vidhansabha vaale uttar pradesh chunaav main bijepi ne kisi bhi musalmaan ko tikat nahin diya tha, jiske chalate unhen virodhiyon ke hamale bhi jhelane pade the
 None of the 325 mlas who won on the ticket of BJP and its allies are Muslims
 iske baad bhi yogi adityanath ke mantrimandal main mohsin raja ko shaamil kiye jane kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 Mohsin Raza is a former cricketer who joined BJP just before assembly elections
 bijepi ne unhen pravaktaa banaaya tha, jiske chalate ve aksar tivi channelon par bijepi kaa paksh rakhte hue dekhe jate rahe hai
 The comments mohsin raja pehali baar tab charchaa main aae the jab unhone 2013 main bijepi ke samarthan main poster lagaaya tha
 Mohsin Raza, 40, studied at Government Jubilee Inter College
 iske baad unhone lakhanu uniwarsity se ucch shiksha hasil kiya
 Mohsin Raza will have to get the membership of the Legislative Assembly or the Legislative Council within six months after assuming office
 maaloom ho ki uttar pradesh main kareeb 19 fisadi musalamaanon kii aabaadi he

 (also from input language) (input bhashaa se bhi) a danger that hung before the world like a drawn sword
 ek khatra jo duniya par musiibat kii tarah tut saktaa tha
 a danger which in its own way would have brought the whole world unwanted
 ganimat he ki wo khatra ab kuch talataa hua nazar aa rahaa he
 The ice on Iran and America's relations is melting now
 kyonki jo kal tak marane-maarane par utaaru the
 They are now agreeing to come to the negotiating table
 haa ye sach he ki america raashtrapati trump or irani raashtrapati hasan ruhani ne ek duusare se milane kii hami to bhari he
 But before this Mahamillan, both countries will have to go through certain conditions
 kul milakar labboluab ye he ki rishton main ai is garmaahat ke baad duniya ab ye sunne ko betaab he ki vishwayuddh kaa khatra ab tal jayega
 This news is definitely shocking
 magar sach he
 However, this truth also has to go through many conditions before it becomes a reality
 kisi ne nahin sochaa tha ki ye do desh bhi kabhi ek saath ek teble par aa sakate hai
 But the doors of the gun windows were closed
 wo ab khulne lage hai
 US President Donald Trump himself has given this shocking news to the world by giving a statement
 trump kaa kahana he ki wo iran ke raashtrapati hasan ruhani se milanaa chahenge
 But seeing the right opportunity and atmosphere
 iran ke parmaanu kaarykram par pratibandh lagane vaale 2015 ke samjhaute se pichley saal america ke ekatarfa hataae jane ke baad se hi donon deshon ke rishton main kaafii tanaav aa gaya he
 But after the initiative of French President Emmanuel Macron, the relationship between the two countries is beginning to see the melting of frozen ice
 maikraan ne frans main ji7 kii baithak main iran ke videsh mantri ko bhi nyotaa diya tha
 The two held long talks to ease tension conditions in the Gulf
 jiske baad maikraan ne trump ko bhi is tanaav ko kam karne ke liye manaane kii koshish kii
 And now Trump has also hoped for a new nuclear deal with Iran
 trump kii ye tippanee ji7 deshon ke shikhar sammelan par ai
 The meeting included G7 countries including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and USA
 jahaan kai muddon par baatcheet hui
 But at the center of the conversation was the tension between the US and Iran
 kyonki ek taraf to america ne jessipie yani joint compreehensive plan of ection deal se khud ko baahar kar liya or duusari taraf wo iran par lagaataar nae pratibandh lagaataa ja rahaa he
 Because of which Iran is angry
 isi vajah se donon desh aamane-saamne aa gaye hai
 JCPA calls deal with Iran with P5 Plus One countries
 jisamen china, france, rus, england or america jaise sthai sadsy deshon ke alaava germany bhi shaamil he
 In which it was decided that Iran will stop its nuclear programs
 or badale main us par lage vyapaarik pratibandhon ko hataa liya jayega
 But when he became President of Donald Trump in America, he disassociated himself from this deal
 or donon deshon ke bich jabardast tension kaa maahaul banataa chalaa gaya
 Earlier, Iranian President Hassan Ruhani also softened his stand on the US, saying that if he believes that there can be a middle ground to reduce this tension
 or us raste se iran ko faaydaa pahonchega to wo kisi se bhi milane ko taiyaar hai
 It is being told that in France, the foreign minister Mohammad Jawad Zarif and the French Foreign Minister and French President Macron have been found to have a middle ground
 jiske baad donon deshon ke raashtrapati yani trump or ruhani ke bich mulaaqaat ke halaat bhi ban gaye hai
 However, nothing is sure about this deal and things are in a critical phase
 lekin kuch takneekee masalon par baatcheet shuru ho chuki he or usamen pragati ho rahi he
 Let me tell you that in May last year, the US announced its separation from the agreement and imposed 12 conditions for the removal of the new nuclear agreement and sanctions
 isamen iran se belistic missile kaarykram par roak lagane or ilaakai tanaav main shaamil hone se dur rahane jaisi sharten thim
 Which Iran refused to accept
 ab iran ke saath jis nae samjhaute kii baat ho rahi he, usamen bhi america chahta he ki iran parmaanu hathiyaar or belistic missile ke nirmaan se lambey vakt ke liye dur rahe
 However, it is not yet clear whether Iran will accept these new conditions

 Veeru remains very active on social media after taking a break from cricket
 wo bharat or england ke bich kheli ja rahi test siries main camentry kar rahe hai or is dauraan sahvaag ke phans khilaadiyon par hansane vaale chuktalon or van liners kaa khub majaa le rahe hai
 In a special conversation from Aaj Tak, he revealed how he makes so many jokes
 sande ho yaa mande sadabahaar viru ke fundatim india ke captain viraat kohli apane shandaar pradarshan se lagaataar charchaa main hai
 On this Virender Sehwag said in his own style that, Virat Kohli should change his name to 'badal' because the clouds are raining and thundering
 kohli par kaha gaya ye joke in dinon soshal media par khub charchaa main hai
 How to make Veeru One Liner Jokesvirendra Sehwag when asked how he makes so many jokes
 is par unhone kaha ki unki koshish hoti he kisi ke naam ke aage yaa naam ke peeche yaa phir date of berth par kya jugalbandi ho sakati he use dhyaan main rakhkar wo chutakle banaate hai
 The Test series is going on between India and England
 unke paas cook, root or butler jaise khilaadi hai
 If the cook is out early, then there will be a joke that the cook will have to cook, so he got out early
 jose butler par joke banegaa ki wo butler ko khaanaa bananaa hoga
 If Joe freezes while batting on the root, then the jock will become 'root kanal'
 saurav ganguli hai sahvaag ke jokes ke bade prashansaksahvaag ke chutaklon kaa to har koi divaana he
 In such a situation, how did Sourav Ganguly, the former captain of Team India, stay behind
 ganguli jab bhi subah sokar uthte hai to wo sabase pehle twitor check karte hai, sahvaag ne nayaa koun sa joke kiya
 To this, Sehwag said in his own way that there was a time when i used to play under the captaincy of Dada
 to main ye sochataa tha ki saurav kaa subah kya disijan lenge
 Will they keep me in the team or not
 lekin ab vakt badal gaya he
 Sourav gets up in the morning and waits for my tweet
 logon ko hansaana behad mushkil kaam hasahvaag kaa maananaa he ki maujuuda samay main log behad tanaav kii jindagi main rahete hai
 In such a situation, if someone enjoys their jokes, then what can be more than that
 meri koshish he ki log hameshaa hansate rahen
 Apart from this, Veeru said that when he used to bat, he used to sing songs under pressure
 jisase wo tanaav ko kam kar saken
 Sehwag's favorite tweet is Virender Sehwag's favorite tweet when he gave a befitting reply to an England journalist
 rio olympic main bharat ko padak hasil hue the
 There was an atmosphere of celebration in India on this
 england ke patrkaar morgan ne twit kar bharat kaa majaak udaaya tha or likhaa tha ki sava sau karod kii aabaadi vaale desh main sirf do medal jite
 On this, Sehwag said in a pinch
 cricket ke janmdata desh ne apane abtak world cap nahin jeeta

 Fans and friends of the film industry are disillusioned and shocked by Salman Khan's punishment in the black deer poaching case

 Sophia has shared a picture of the actor on Instagram
 jisamen guilty likhaa he
 Along with being human, being cut is written as no more human
 iske saath hi actress ne ek lanbaa post share kiya he
 6 not 7 people important in hunting case, is Salman punished for his 'disappearance'? Written in the photo - Finally you get the fruits of your actions
 bahut se log salmaan ke khilaaf bolne se darate hai, kyonki unhen lagata he salmaan bollywood ko control karte hai
 But i am not afraid of anyone
 mujhe khushi he ki jo salmaan ne kiya uske liye unhen jail janaa padaa
 Karma gets you in the end
 
 
 Many people are afraid to talk against Salman because they think he controls Bollywood
 Well, i no longer serve my ego and therefore am not afraid to speak up
 i am so happy that Salman has gone to jail for what he has done
 Animals are so important to this planet and doing what he did and then mocking it was a huge act of his own self importance
 Lots of children look up to him, and he has a responsibility to the young people
 What is he showing the world when he does things like this? What lessons is he giving them? That it is ok to break the law, to kill animals and then mock it because he is a celebrity? In any western country he would have been vilified for this and the drink driving deaths that he caused
 He has then reinvented himself as a charitable man to try and compensate his karma
 Today, India has shown that no matter who you are, if you break the law, you are no bigger than the law
 i have heard so many young people in India speak about how they are afraid to go to the police about crimes committed by others because they watch the tv and see how people with money and status get away with it because they have paid off the police or the judge or the lawyers
 This happened to me when Armaan Kohli paid off 2 of my lawyers so that i could not continue with the case, Dolly Bindra also told me that Armaans family are powerful enough to put drugs in my bag at the airport and i would be in Jail
 i had to then drop the case as all the lawyers i hired were paid off
 Today, Hindustan can stand strong and hold its head up high to the world and show them that justice is held up in India, and today, all the poor people have been shown a glimmer of hope in their own fight for justice against those who have manipulated the law

 bahut saare bachche unhen apana idal maanate hai
 In such a situation, Salman should take responsibility for the youth
 aisa kaam karke ve yuvaaon ko kya sandesh dena chaahate hai? galat kaam karo, phir uskaa or kanoon kaa majaak udaao, kyonki aap celebrity ho?kya is actress ke uksaave par salmaan ne kiya tha hiran kaa shikaar? chashmadid kaa daawasophia ne kaha, aaj bharat ne bataa diya ki aap chaahe jo bhi ho, kanoon se bada koi nahin he

 The Ashes series will begin from July 8, but a verbal war has started between England and Australia players regarding the series
 england ke purv spinner grem swaan ne australian ballebaaz steven smith ko mahaan ballebaaz maanane se inkaar kar diya he
 According to Swan, the England team is not worried about Smith nor has he lost sleep
 swaan ne 2013-14 aishez ke bich main hi cricket se sanyas le liya tha, lekin isse pehle wo 22 pariyon main teen baar smith kaa wicket le chuke the
 "the 26-year-old Smith is poor in technique and cannot play the swinging ball properly and he wonders how he became the number one batsman in the icc's ranking of current Test batsmen," Swann said
 36 saal ke is english spinner ne yah bhi kaha ki smith, mathew heden or adam gilcrist kii tarah ajey nahin hai
 However, Swann, who took 255 wickets in 60 Tests for England, praised Steve Waugh and compared him to Smith
 swaan ke mutabik wa out karnaa kisi bhi gendbaaz ke bas kii baat nahin thi, lekin smith ke saath aisa nahin he
 The comments steven smith ke shandaar form kaa andaaza isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki unhone pichley ek saal main 8 test kii 16 pariyon main 102
 Has scored 1226 runs at an average of 16
 is dauraan unke balle se 5 shatak or 5 ardhshtak bhi nikle
 It is clear that England are in awe of Smith in such excellent form
 isi vajah se team ke purv khilaadiyon ne bayaanbazi kar manobal todane kaa tarika apanaaya he
 Swann retired from cricket in the middle of the 2013–14 ashes, but before that he had taken Smith's wicket three times in 22 innings
 swaan ne kaha, '26 saal ke smith kii takanic main karaab he or vah swing karti gend ko thik se nahin khel sakate or unhen aashcharya he ki vah isisi kii maujuuda test ballebaazon kii ranking main number ek ballebaaz kaise ban gaye'
 The 36-year-old English spinner also said that Smith is not invincible like Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist
 haalanki england ke liye 60 test main 255 wicket lene vaale swaan ne steve wa kii jamkar taareef kiya or smith se tulana bhi kar daalaa
 According to Swan, getting out was not a matter of any bowler's bus, but it is not so with Smith
 tippaniyan Steven Smith's superb form can be gauged from the fact that he scored 102 in 16 innings of 8 Tests in the last one year
 16 kii ausat se 1226 ran banaae hai
 During this time, his bat also produced 5 centuries and 5 fifties
 zaahir he aise shandaar form main chal rahe smith se england kii team khoff main he
 For this reason, former players of the team have adopted a method of morale-breaking by making statements

 usee film kii tarah bajrangi bhaijan bhi bharat or pakistan ke bich dushmani bhare rishton par kendrit he
 4
 agar aap pichley varshon main salmaan kii filmon kii list par najar daalen to (dabang 2, jai ho, kik) aapako kaaphi saaf suthri filmein dekhne ko milegi
 It is also needed, as he is caught in two court cases and has the ability to derail his career and hence Bajrangi Bhai is also special to Salman, where he is seen to be spreading love between two countries

 tippaniyan 9
