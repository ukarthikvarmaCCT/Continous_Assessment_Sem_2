 This is said in the interview given to com
 chunaav kaa bahishkaar karengegilani ne saaf kiya ki unki party jammu-kashmir main hone vaale aagaamee vidhansabha chunaavon kaa bahishkaar karegi
 He says that 7
 5 lakh sena ke javaanon kii maujuudagi main kabhi bhi voter apane aap ko aaazaad mahasoos nahin karegaa
 On the question that he wants to see the next Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, his answer was that no matter who is the Chief Minister but the Home Ministry rules this state, everyone else acts like his effigy
 centre sarkaar sirf jammu-kashmir ke logon ko pratadit karne ke liye chunaav karaati he
 When Gilani was asked if the Hurriyat's hold on the youth of Kashmir had weakened now, he said that all these rumors had spread to Indian intelligence
 kashmir ke yuva aaj bhi hurriyat ke saath aatma se jude hue hai or koi bhi jhootha prachaar hamen alag nahin kar saktaa
 On the question asked on Umar Abdullah, the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, 'nero of Kashmir', Gilani said that the Government of India has been working to harass the people of this state for the last 67 years and at the moment Omar is also dancing on the gestures of the Central Government
 The leaders have proved themselves
 kashmir ke itihaas main umr kaa kaarykaal ab tak kaa sabase ghatiya kaarykaal rahaa he
 He has become the 'nero of Kashmir'
 bharat ko 'hindu raashtra' bana rahe hai modinarendra modi ke kaam kaaj par gilaani ne kaha ki chaahe sarkaar kisi kii bhi party kii ho lekin centre sarkaar kii policy vahi rahati he
 But beyond all this, Narendra Modi is a Hindu leader who dominates the ideology of RSS and his only agenda is to make India a 'hindu Rashtra'
 anuchhed 370 packnuchhed 370 par kendriya mantri or jammu ke saansad jitendra singh dwaara anuchhed 370 par die gaye bayaan par gilaani kaa kahana tha ki centre sarkaar andar hi andar iske khilaaf he lekin kashmiri logon ke virodh ke dar se sarkaar is maamle main khulkar bolne se bachati rahi he
 When asked on Modi's initiative on indo-pak relationship, Jab Geelani said that it was too early to say anything on this issue
 is mudde ko vakt par chhod dena hi behatar he
 None of the Prime Ministers who have been in the last 30-40 years had the courage to talk about the Kashmir issue
 yah puche jane par ki wo 10 saal baad kashmir ko kaisaa dekhnaa chaahate hai to unka jawaab tha ki kashmir ko yuva aazaadee chaahate hai or yakeenan aane vaala vakt unka hoga

 jisamen se 37 thode gambhir maamle hai baaki dharna prardashan or sarkari kaam main baadha jaise maamle hai jo aksar netaaon par police lagaati rahati he
 Hanuman is pleased with laddus
 laddu chadhaane se bhakton ko de dete hai manachaaha vardaan
 Some of the temples of Bajrangbali where laddus are seen asking
 ujjain ke ranjit hanuman jo laddu chadhaane se de dete hai bhakton ko manachaaha vardaan
 Bajrangbali is delighted with Motichoor and Besan ladoos
 yun to hanuman ji gud chane ke prasad se prasann hote hai lekin ranjit hanuman ko sabase priy he motichur or besan ke laddu
 It is said that any devotee who offers laddus to Hanuman here with Tulsi leaves gets his wish fulfilled
 yun to is mandir main har din hi bhakt apni manokamanaayen lekar aate hai lekin mangalvaar or shanivaar ko yahaan vishesh pujan hota he or jo bhi bhakt is din laddu kaa prasad chadhaata he use mil jaataa he hanuman kaa aashirwad or hanuman puri kar dete hai bhakton kii har muraad
 In the temple of Pawanaputra Hanuman, who sits on the banks of Shipra river in Ujjain, there is a flow of devotees for twelve months
 pariksha main paas hona ho yaa mukademon main jeet hasil karnaa ho, ruke kaam puure karnaa ho yaa dushmano se paar paanaa ho, ranjit hanuman har muraad puri karte hai
 Here, Hanuman gives the boon of victory in every difficult battle of life
 isiilie to yahaan hanuman ko ranjit hanuman kaha jaataa he
 It is said that once in a battle of two kings, a king reached the verge of losing the battle

 He gave some pieces of bread to the king and told him not to look back and put it on the way until it was over
 jahaan ye tukade khatm honge vahaan tumhen ek mandir milegaa or vahiin tumhaari sari pareshaaniyaan dur ho jaaengi
 The king did the same, and the temple outside which the pieces of bread ran out belonged to Hanuman ji, when the king looked back and saw a large army was behind him, he again fought and won
 tabhi se is mandir ko ranjit hanuman mandir kaha jane laga
 Ranjit Hanuman's makeup is also special, vermilion and jasmine oil are worn, then his idol is decorated with beauty
 inaki puja kaa aarambh sabase pehle ram ji ke phir hanumanji ke bhajanon se hota he
 The entire atmosphere becomes devotional with the hymns of Hanuman Ji for 2 to 3 hours on Saturday and Tuesday evenings
 bhakton ke bhakt hai hanuman
 You become happy in small moments with small things
 ab hardoi ke hanuman ji ko hi lijie yahaan jhanda or laddu chadhaane se bhagwaan puri kar dete hai apane bhakton ke dil kii har ichha
 It is said that those who come to Ranjit Hanuman's temple never go empty-handed, just by offering special laddus in devotion and worship in the heart, Ranjit makes Hanuman do all the bad things
 jhanda banayega aapke har bigade kamakapade kaa ek chota sa jhanda aapako dilaa saktaa he samast kashton se mukti or sanvaar saktaa he aapkaa jivan
 Just one day of worship in the court of Bajrangbali and offering of flags with laddus will complete your every wish
 uttar pradesh ke hardoi jile ke sandila ilaake main is chote se mandir kii mahima anant he
 The idol of Virajit Pawanputra in this temple is as miraculous as it is the law of worship here
 yahaan bhakt laddu sang jhanda chadhaakar maangate he bajrangbali se aashirwad lekin jhande kii aisi mahima or chamatkaar aapako saal main keval ek hi din dekhne ko miltaa he
 And that is the last Tuesday of Bhado month
 kehete hai jo koi is din hone vaali jhanda yatra main shaamil hokar bajrangbali ke darbar main jhanda chadha detaa he uski muraadon ko mil jaataa he pavanputra kaa aashirwad
 Devotees call this temple as Mahaviran Temple

 Pooja of 11 Tuesdays in Mahavir's court removes the sufferings of devotees' lives
 or agar phulon ke saath laddu chadha die jaaen to kahana hi kya
 Hanuman ji comes here as a devotee, just a laddu fulfills the wish
 kehete hai sadhesati se peedit jaatakon ke liye ye mandir kisi vardaan se kam nahin
 This form of Bajrangbali makes the destruction of Shani devotions, whether it is Dhaiyya or a small worship of the name of Sadesati Hanuman, liberates the devotees from the wrath of Shani Dev
 is mandir main hameshaa aane vaale ek shraddhalu acharya brajesh shastri kaa kahana he ki yahaan par hanuman harek bhakt kii manokamana puri karte hi hai kintu jin logon kii kundali main yaa gochar main shani kupit hota he wo agar paanch shanivaar aakar puja karen to unke grah dur ho jaaenge
 If Bajrangbali liberates someone from half a century, then he also blesses the children
 jinke jivan se santan kii khushiyaan ruthi hoti hai unhen aulad kaa sukh dete hai bajrangbali
 It is said that if students get jobs by coming here, then the business of businessmen shines

 The case is of Indore
 maamle main vishesh fasttrack adaalat ne ladki ke chachaa ko aaj faansee kii sajaa sunaayi, jabaki uski patni (ladki kii chachee) ko umrakaid kii sajaa sunai

 Baby was accused of being involved in plotting and executing the girl's murder
 sarkari vakil ne bataaya ki bacchee ke shav kii postmortem report main pushti hui ki uski maut shaareerik pratadna or marpet se hui thi
 The child was badly beaten, Kodesai said that during the postmortem a total of 31 wounds were found on different parts of the girl
 inamen se kuch ghaav puraane bhi the
 The postmortem revealed that the girl had been raped and had unnatural acts before the murder
 abhiyojan paksh ke sarkari vakil ne bataaya ki diene pareekshan se is baat kii tasadeeq hui ki hatyakand se pehle maasoom bacchee ke saath dushkarm or aprakritik krity karne vaala shaks koi or nahin, balki uskaa chachaa hi he
 According to Goddesai, she took the girl with confidence, the real parents of the girl live in Uttar Pradesh
 bacchee ko uski hatya se kareeb chaar maah pehle hi uske chachaa or chachee ne god liya tha, kyonki unke donon bacchon kii maut ho gai thi
 While adopting the uncle-aunt, her parents were assured that she would be raised well and would be taught in a good school, but nothing happened and Sanger and his wife beat up the girl badly
 Started torturing him inhuman
 uttar pradesh main sampradayik hinsa kii badhati ghatnaon ne upree halkon main khatre kii ghanti baja di he
 The Intelligence Bureau (IB) has warned the Center about the "delicate situation" in the state
 shuukravaar kii raat gajiabad ke musuri ilaake main hui hinsa main chah log maare gaye
 It is a sign that the state is at the mouth of communal explosion
 aise muhane par jisamen ek choti chingaari bhi danga bhadkaa sakati he
 This is the seventh riot in Uttar Pradesh after the Akhilesh Yadav-led government was formed
 ibi ne centre ko soochna di he ki upi kii najuk sthiti ek badi chetavanee ban sakati he
 According to him, the manner of most of the riots has remained the same — the local dispute over a minor case spread to a large extent

 SSP of Ghaziabad Prashant Kumar admits, "what happened is part of a conspiracy that was hatched many hours before the violence
" hamalavar ghaatak hathiyaar liye gum rahe the, jisase sanket miltaa he ki ve peshewar apradhi the
 "he said," We consider it intelligence failure

 We have also recommended the suspension of three officers of the Local Intelligence Unit (LAU)
 is ghatana ke silsile main agyaat hamalaavaron or afvaah failaane waalon ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya gaya he
 "now the pressure on the SP government has increased so much that it should establish harmony and law and order in the state
" grih mantralay ke naveenatam aankadon se khulaasa hota he ki upi sarkaar sampradayik hinsa se prabhavi tareeke se nibatane main naakaam rahi he
 UP has recorded the highest number of communal incidents (364) in the country in the last three years, killing 64 people and injuring 1,298
 yahaan tak ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne bhi pichley hafte rajyon ke dijipi ko sambodhit karte hue upi or chaar anya rajyon (madhya pradesh, maharashtra, karnataka or kerala) ko sampradayik hinsa ke lihaaj se ati samvedansheel bataaya
 Communal incidents have given SP opponents an opportunity to attack the government
 basapa ne aarope lagaaya he ki sarkaar musalamaanon kii raksha karne main naakaam sabit hui he
 Everyone knows that Muslims have played an important role in bringing SP back to power
 basapa ke is aarope se muslim samudaay ke kuch log prabhavit bhi dikhte hai kyonki aisa mana ja rahaa he ki pichhali mayawati sarkaar ke samay kanoon-vyavastha kii haalat isse behatar thi
 But the BJP seems to benefit from communal polarization
 july main hue sthaneey nikaay chunaavon main bijepi ko achche parinaam mili hai
 He has won the post of Mayor of several big cities like Ghaziabad, Lucknow, Kanpur, Meerut, Agra, Gorakhpur, Moradabad, Aligarh, Jhansi and Varanasi
 party ko vidhansabha chunaavon ke antim daur main bhi acchhee safalataa mili thi, jo pashchim uttar pradesh ke muslim bahul ilaakon main hue the
 The SP, however, denies that there is a serious law and order problem in the state
 sapa pravaktaa rajendra choudhary kehete hai, ''jaise hi sapa satta main ai, hamaare virodhiyon ne cheekhnaa shuru kar diya ki rajya main kanoon-vyavastha khatm ho gai he
 "communalism is a social problem," he says
 yah sirf uttar pradesh ke maujuuda shashan se judi baat nahin he
 One can find that SP has been at the forefront of fighting communalism
 '' Dragon's attempt to surround India through Sri Lanka has received a major setback
 mangalvaar ko srilanka ne china kii ore se hambantota bandargah ko viksit karne ke qaraar main badlaav kar diya he
 This decision of the Sri Lankan cabinet is a relief news for India
 srilankai cabinet ne desh kii janata ke virodh ke chalate yah kadam uthaaya he
 Recently the Sri Lankan people protested by accusing their government of selling Hambantota port to China
 sthaneey logon ke saath hi buddha bhikshu bhi china ke khilaaf sadakon par utre the
 China had entered into an agreement to develop Hambantota port in the south of Sri Lanka and to build Chinese investment there to surround India
 isamen ahm baat yah thi ki china is bandargah ko sainya gatividhiyon ke liye bhi upyog kar saktaa tha
 Under this, the Sri Lankan government had asked to give 80 per cent stake to China state-owned China Merchants Port Holding
 is bandargah ko viksit karne main chini company 1
 Was going to invest 5 billion dollars
 sthaneey janata ke virodh ko dekhte hue srilanka sarkaar ne bandargah ko sanchaalan par china kii bhoomika ko simit kar diya he
 Also, now China will not be able to use this port for military purposes
 srilanka ke is kadam se bharat ke saath hi japan or america kii chintaa dur hogi
 The threat to India increased when the Chinese submarine reached Colombo in 2014
 yahaan par chini kii ek duusari company 1
 Port City is making $ 4 billion investment
 bharat srilanka ko apana dakshini tat hi maanata he
 In such a situation, China's presence here is a matter of concern for India
 jab may mempiem narendra modi srilanka ke dauraper the, to colombo main chini pandubbi ko khadaa karne kii ijaajat nahin di gai thi
 This increased wrinkle on China's forehead

 Now this move of Sri Lanka is being considered in the interest of India
 hambantota par niyantran ke peeche china kii manshaa apane silk root ko safal banane ke saath hi bharat ko samudri maarg se gherna he
 In the name of developing an industrial zone, China plans to acquire 15,000 acres of land here

 Suspected terrorist Abu Zaid has been arrested from Mumbai Airport in a joint operation of UP ATS and Maharashtra Police
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki abu jaid kal hi saudi arab se bharat aayaa tha
 He is a resident of Azamgarh in UP
 ibi ne is sandigdh aatanki ke khilaaf luk out notice jari kiya hua tha
 According to the information, the suspected terrorist Abu Zaid was guiding some people living in India from Saudi Arabia
 vah ek mobile ap ke jariye un logon se baatcheet karata tha
 It is being told that these people were preparing to carry out a major terrorist incident
 isse pehle mumbai airport par upi police ke DSP anup singh ne giraftaar kar liya
 Earlier in July this year, UP ATS arrested suspected lashkar-e-taiba terrorist Salim Khan from Mumbai Airport
 upi police ko saal 2008 se is sandigdh aatanki kii talash thi
 The accused hails from Fatehpur in UP
 vah iesai ke agenton ko finance kiya karata tha
 This gave the police many important clues
 khufia soochna ke aadhaar par upi aties ne mumbai airport se lashkar-e-taiyaba ke sandigdh aatanki saleem khan ko giraftaar kiya tha
 Salim was the financier of an ISI agent captured from Faizabad
 sena kii jasusi ke liye aftab ko saleem ne hi finance kiya tha
 Salim has taken training at Muzaffarabad Camp in Pakistan
 police poochtacha main pataa chalaa tha ki saleem khan iesai agent aftab ko videsh se nirdesh detaa tha or uske kaam ke liye paise bhejtaa tha
 Earlier arrested terrorists Kausar and Sharif had told that Salim was training with them in Muzaffarabad terrorist camp in 2007
 vah upi ke fatehpur ke bandipur thane ke haathgaanv kaa rahane vaala he
 At that time, Salim Khan had told that in front of the copy shop he used to work, there was a vegetable shop
 uske yahaan kausar aata-jaataa rahata tha
 He met him for the first time and after offering namaz started going to his house
 kausar ke ghar sharif se mulaakaat hui
 He only showed her some videos
 video main bharat virdohi chijen maujuud thim
 After this he wished to take Lashkarki training
 kausar or sharif ne uske pakistan jane kaa intjaam karaayaa
 Laid out of Karachi Airport through an ISI agent
 karachi main 2 din tak rahane ke baad use bahawalpur le jaaya gaya
 Stayed there for 10 days
 yahaan se mujaffarabad camp main gaya, jahaan uski lakhvi se mulaakaat hui thi
 Vijay Bahadur Singh, the Hamirpur sacked from Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), on Wednesday, did not make any statement in praise of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 yah darasal bijepi ke game plan kaa hissaa tha
 The party wanted to send a message to its upper caste voters in another way that how all are coming towards Modi in his name
 vijay bahadur ko hamirpur se bijepi tikat kii aas ne aisa karne ke liye uksaaya
 The immediate reason for this was the bsp's denial of tickets for the next election
 kya kaha saansad ji ne nishkasana ke badhvaaya mishra ji hui thi bispi main entrihamirpur se bispi ke tikat par 2009 main saansad banane se pehle vijay bahadur singh raajnneeti ke galiyaaron main janaa pahachaanaa naam nahin the
 This lawyer Sahab, born in Rewa Madhya Pradesh, had studied in Allahabad University and had enrolled in the High Court there
 yaheen unki bispi ke number tu satish chandra mishra se jaan-pahchaan hui or phir usee ke dam par vah hamirpur kaa tikat le aae
 He defeated Samajwadi Party (SP) sitting MP Rajnarayan Budhaulia alias Rajju Maharaj by 25 thousand votes
 darasal bispi ne apni puraani ranneeti ko hi is seat par nae sire se aajamaaya tha
 In 2009, the BSP had contested another Bahubali Thakur leader Ashok Chandel and the party wrested this seat from the BJP
 bispi jaanati thi ki thakur or paramparaagat dalit vot yahaan kaa vining combination he
 But Vijay Bahadur did not like bsp's culture very much
 bataaya jaataa he ki vah kshetra main zyada sakriy bhi nahin rahe
 Then when the party conducted an internal survey for the next Lok Sabha elections, the negative report of Vijay Bahadur came
 usee din tay kar liya gaya ki ab bispi ranneeti badalegi
 On June 10, it was announced that the party would cut its sitting MP ticket and former MLA Rakesh Goswami would contest from here
 goswami hamirpur loksabhaa main aane vaali mahoba vidhansabha se 2007 main bispi ke tikat par vidhayak chune gaye the
 But in 2012, he was not given a ticket
 goswami party ke brahman candidet ke paimaane par khare utarane vaale 21wein pratyaashee the
 By then Vijay Bahadur had also got the idea of this bet
 hamirpur se bijepi vidhayak sadhvi niranjan jyoti thim
 Efforts were made to foment the BJP with his support
 taar rajnath singh tak pahunche
 Then the bet was made that BSP mps should speak in favor of BJP at the right time, make their allegiance public, then their ticket will be considered
 bispi ne damp kiya tha sanghathan menisi yojana ke tahat chaar roj pehle vijay bahadur singh ne kaha ki modi ji kaa 'papi' vaala bayaan sirf yahi bataata he ki vah samvedansheel praani hai or anhisa ko maanate hai
 After this statement, the BSP also opened its horses
 party ne vijay bahadur ko tikat nahin diya tha
 But it was said that he should see the work of the organization in Bundelkhand
 magar vijay bahadur ne jab apana alag rasta chunaa, to unhen buudhvaar ko rukhsati kaa paravaanaa thama diya gaya
 By the way, from June onwards, lawyers started saying that there is no future in this country due to the small thinking of regional parties
 magar kehane ko to vah yah bhi kah rahe the ki meraa chunaav ladane kaa man nahin he
 Made up his mind as he showed a new path to return to Parliament
 bijepi hamirpur kabjane ke liye lalachaa rahi he
 He hit a hat-trick of victory here
 1989 main yahaan se gangacharan rajput saansad bane the janata dal ke tikat par
 He then became the national president of Janata Dal Youth
 1991 main bijepi ke vishwanath sharma ne party kaa khaataa kholaa
 Then in a few years, Kalyan Singh joined BJP on his own seat in Ganga Charan Lodh fraternity and got party ticket in 1996
 vah 1996 or 1998 main jite, magar 1999 main ashok chandel ke haathon haar gaye
 Then Ganga Charan sometimes reached BSP while going to Congress, sometimes SP and became MP from Rajya Sabha
 uma bharti yaheen se hai vidhayakahamirpur seat bijepi ke liye isliye bhi khaas he kyonki uma bharti bhi yahi kii ek seat charkhaari se vidhayak hai
 He has considerable influence in Lodhi votes
 kathavachan ke dinon se hi vah is ilaake main sakriy rahi hai
 The BJP is thinking that it will take Lodh, Thakur votes with this strategy and in the name of Modi it will get the middle class and the party's traditional votes
 pradhanmantri narendra modi agle maheene australian sansad ke sanyukt satr ko sambodhit karenge
 Modi will be the first Indian Prime Minister to address members and leaders of Parliament of Australia at a special joint meeting of the Federal Parliament here
 vah agle maheene 15 or 16 november ko brisben main hone ja rahe ji-20 netaaon ke shikhar sammelan main shaamil honge
 He will then address a joint session of Parliament
 pradhanmantri ke taur par modi kii pehali australia yatra ko lekar jahaan kai saansadon ne khushi jaahir kii he vahiin unke hindi main bhaashan dene ke bare main bhi atakalein shuru ho gai hai
 Will Modi deliver a speech in Hindi? Tasmania Labor Senator Lisa Singh said Modi's address in Hindi would mean he is coming to Australia with India's honor, culture and abilities
 42 saal kii lija ne kaha ki isse pataa chalata he ki vah bharat kaa sammaan, samskruti or kshamtaaon ko saath lekar australia aa rahe hai or unki is yatra kaa hamaare desh main hona meri raay main ahm he
 He said that it is a matter of great pride to address our Parliament
 mere liye yah baat koi myne nahin rakhti ki vah hamaari sansad ko kis bhashaa main sambodhit karenge
 Lisa said that if Modi's address in Hindi gives Indian diaspora respect here then they should do so
 duniya ke kai hisson main bhi unhone aisa kiya he or vah un logon main se hai jo maanate hai ki bharat sabase alag desh he or main samaj sakati hum ki is anokhepan ke liye hi vah apni mul bhashaa main bolnaa chaahate hai
 He said that as Australians we should respect it
 'loktantr main angreji kaa ekadhikaar nahin'lija ne kaha ki unhone apni haalia bharat yatra main mahasoos kiya ki modi ke shashan sanbhaalane ke baad desh bhar main nayaa utsaah he
 He said that he encouraged India afresh
 
 Rory Medkoff of the Lowy Institute, a Sydney think-tank, said the news of Modi's address to the Australian Parliament is an appreciative sign of how far Australia and India have progressed
 madcof ne kaha agar modi hindi main sambodhit karte hai to koi nuksaan nahin hoga
 They have a good hold on that language and this will again remind the people of Australia that it is one of the fastest growing languages in the country and English will not have a monopoly in democracy

 The son recently received a mining engineering degree

 ''roak ke baad mining se sidhe yaa paroksh rup se jude kareeb do lakh log sankat main funs gaye hai
 The unprecedented protest in Panaji on March 20 was in the news in the media but there was no action from the authorities
 mining par pabandi kaa pehla asar us vakt najar aayaa jab chaar sabase badi khanan companiyon main se ek vedanta limited ne 21 march ko apane karmchaariyon se kaam par na aane kii baat kahi

 The ban is a shame on the government, as the Supreme Court has also questioned the haste shown in renewing the mining lease in 2015, while the Mining and Minerals (regulation and Development) Act only empowers the state government to do so
 Does not give enjio goa foundation kii yachika par 23 farvari ko die aadesh main supreme court ne goa sarkaar se kaha tha ki vah kul 88 mining lij nae sire se jari kare kyonki "rajya sarkaar ne mining lij kaa doosraa navinikaran bahut jaldbaaji main kiya or usamen sabhi muddon kaa dhyaan nahin rakhaa gaya tha
 
 
 Hence it is not in the interest of mining development
 ''supreme court ne yah bhi spasht kar diya tha ki nai mining lij jari karne kaa matlab lij kaa navinikaran nahin he, lihaaja ab rajya sarkaar main bahes chal rahi he ki kya mining lij kii nilaamee kerani chahie
 The Goa Mineral Ore Exporters Association (GMOEA) believes that the current confusion has been created due to ambiguities and misinterpretations in the Mining Act
 adhinium main 2015 main hue sanshodhan main mining lij ke teen vikalp prastaavit kiye gaye theru navinikaran yaa to agle navinikaran tak vaid rahenge yaa navinikaran ke 15 saal tak yaa phir 31 march, 2020 tak
 However the Supreme Court has rejected the renewals of the state government and remarked that "this decision was taken merely to increase the revenue of the state and is beyond the scope of Article 8 (3) of the MMDR Act
" ''tatkaaleen mukhyamantri lakshmikant parsekar, jinke kaarykaal main 2015 main lijon kaa navinikaran kiya gaya tha, is aarope ko nakaarte hai
 He says that the mining work was resumed to provide relief to those who had become jobless
 ve kehete hai, "khanan ruk jane ke baad aam logon main kaaphi rosh or afra-tafari kaa maahaul tha
 "amber Timblu, managing director of Fomento Resources, one of the oldest mining companies in Goa and chairman of GMOEA, cited the petition that the mining companies had filed in the Supreme Court, stating that the mines were not public property
" unhone goa, daman or div khanan anumati (khanan lij ghoshnaa or unmoolan) adhinium 1987 kii sanvaidhanik vaidhata ko chunauti di thi jisamen lijon ko rajyon kaa vishay tay kar diya gaya tha
 Timblu states that "the issue of the lease does not arise until the ownership issue is resolved
" '' lekin supreme court ne swaamitv kaa mudda tay karne kii unki yachika ko khaarij kar diya he
 Indefinite future Timblu claims that no company is against the auction of mines whose demands are being demanded by all activists
 asli masalaa yah he ki adhinium ko puri tarah lagu kiya janaa chahie
 They say, "after all, you cannot walk with only one part of the law
 ''visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki khaanon kii nilaamee main kam se kam teen saal lagenge, kyonki yah ek jatil prakriya he
 Retired mining engineer Anirudh Joshi says that any auction will become attractive when 5-6 leases are merged together for auction

 Joshi says, "it will take at least six months to merge the leases

 '' abhi louh ayask kii keemat 35 dollar prati ton he jo 2012 main 100 dollar prati ton thi

 Who has the right over the Taj Mahal? Government, Archaeological Survey of India or Sunni Waqf Board? When the matter came to the threshold of the Supreme Court, the court said, who in the country will now believe that Taj Mahal is the property of Waqf Board? Court should not spend time by bringing such cases here
 supreme court kaa yah bayaan ASI kii yachika par sunwaayee ke dauraan aayaa he
 In the petition, the ASI has challenged the 2005 Uttar Pradesh Sunni Waqf Board's decision, in which the board declared Taj Mahal as the property of the Waqf Board
 sankshipt sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne kaha kimughalkaal kaa antahone ke saath hi tajmahal samet anya aitihaasik imaaraten angrejon ko hastantarit ho gai thi
 Since independence, the memorial is with the government and the ASI is looking after it
 board kii ore se kaha gaya ki sunniyon ke paksh main mughal badshaah shahjahan ne hi taj mahal kaa vakpanama taiyaar karavaaya tha
 The Bench immediately asked that you show us the documents signed by Shah Jahan
 board ke aagrah par court ne ek hafte kii mohalat de di
 In fact, the Sunni Waqf Board had issued an order to register Taj Mahal as its property
 eesai ne iske khilaaf supreme court main apil kii thi
 On this, the court stayed the decision of the board
 mohammad irfan bedaar ne elahabaad hai court ke samaksh yachika daakhil kar tajmahal ko uttar pradesh sunni central vaqf board kii sampatti ghoshit karne kii maang kii thi
 But in the High Court asked the petitioner to go to Waqf Board
 mohammad irfan bedaar ne 1998 main vaqf board ke samaksh yachika daakhil kar tajmahal ko board kii sampati ghoshit karne kii maang kii
 The board had issued a notice to the ASI seeking an answer
 ASI ne apane jawaab main iskaa virodh kiya or kaha ki tajmahal unki sampatti he
 But the board had declared the assets of Taj Mahalco, bypassing the pleas of ASI

 Modi has said that such meetings are held every year
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki centre ne jo ection teken report di thi, usko lekar unhone kuch baaten kahi thim
 But the central government did not pay attention to it
 iske alaava modi ne centre sarkaar par ekatarfa ravaiya apnaane kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 Modi says that the trust of the states is falling due to the attitude of the Center
 modi ne kaha he ki pehle to gola barood ke liye ham shikaayat karte the, ab sena bhi kah rahi he ki use gola-barood nahin mil rahaa he
 Narendra Modi also described the dispute between the army and the government as a threat to security
 khabar he ki karina kapur agle saptaah dubai ja rahi hai pakistani nirdeshak shoeb mansoor se milane
 Here Shoaib will tell the subject of her next film and if Kareena likes it, she will act in Shoaib Mansoor's film
 tippaniyan It is being told that Pakistani director Shoaib Mansoor wants to cast Kareena Kapoor in his next film
 shoeb ne iske liye karina ko ek email bheja jise padhakar karina shoeb se milane ke liye taiyaar ho gai
 And in this connection, Kareena is going to Dubai to meet Shoaib and listen to the story

 ye donon filmein bharat main bhi kaafii pasand kii gai thim
 Actually, Kareena Kapoor is trying to do different types of films these days
 kuch aisi filmein or bhoomika nibhaane kii jisase unhen saraahna mili, aise main karina ne shoeb mansoor se milane ke liye man banaaya he kyonki pakistan ke ye nirdeshak film 'khud ke liye' or film 'bol' bana chuke hai jise antarrashtriya str par saraahaa gaya he
 Both these films were also well liked in India
 dharm badal karne waalon kaa to pataa nahin lekin modi sarkaar ke aarthik prabandhan kii ghar vaapasi kaa elaan jarur ho gaya he
 With huge government spending, the rule of central schemes, populist makeup of the government and huge losses, the Modi government's economic philosophy is about to settle in the same house on which the Congress had boarded inclusive growth
 modi sarkaar isaki jagah ‘sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas’ kaa poster laga degi
 The first budget of the new government was made in a hurry, which did not clarify the financial and economic philosophy of Team Modi, but the quarterly economic review, released amidst the rush of conversion, has removed the curtain from the Modi government's economic strategy
 modi sarkaar dakiyanoosee or loklubhaavan aarthik prabandhan kii taraf bad rahi he, jisaki ek badi jhalak aane vaale bajet main mil sakati he
 The idea that Ilam came up with to open the pipe of government spending for development is even more worrying
 samiksha ne sweekaar kiya he ki nijee companiyaan nivesh ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Private investment should have started after the new government came in but the reality is that the government undertaking is worth Rs 2 lakh crore
 kii nakadi par baithe hai jabaki nijee companiyaan kareeb 4
 6 lakh crore Rs
 kii nakadi par
 After this, the absence of private investment is actually like the seal of the Finance Ministry on the initial failure of 'make in India'
 centre main sarkaar badalane ke baad sara daaromadar nijee companiyon ke nivesh par tha, jisase rojgaar or growth lautne kii ummid banati thi
 But the government has realized in the first six months that it would be better to go back to the old model of government spending instead of doing more to promote private investment
 baari sarkari kharch kii vaapasi utsahit nahin karti balki daraati he kyonki centre sarkaar ke baari kharch se ubhari visangatiyon kaa dardanaak ateet hamaare paas maujuud he
 The government has neither the resources nor the opportunities to build industries, bridges, roads, ports
 yah kaam to nijee companiyon ko hi karnaa he
 Normally, when governments are unable to generate good quality growth and employment, they increase their spending in subsidies and populist schemes, as we saw in the alleged inclusive growth of the first phase of the UPA rule, which was later followed by budget, growth and Take away the investment
 modi sarkaar kaa kharch rath bhi usee path par chalegaa
 Modi's love for new schemes has been expressed
 yojana ayog ke punargathan main puraani kendriya skiimon ko band karnaa philhal agenda par nahin he isliye endie kii nai skiimon se saje is modi ke rath par congress sarkaar kii scimen pehle se savaar hongi
 The Central Government's spending campaign is a thorny ball that pierces many places with its sharp speckles
 sarkaar kaa rajasav simit he or audyogic mandi khatm hone tak rajasav main tej badhotaree kii ummid bhi nahin he
 a massive spending bill is coming before the government which will include subsidies, higher share of states 'taxes under the recommendations of the Finance Commission, states' payment of share in Central Sales Tax and interim relief on the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission
 isliye agle bajet main ghate kii oonchai dekhne laayak hogi
 Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan is not bothered to curtail interest rates
 ab sarkaar jamkar karj legi, jisase byaaj daron main kami ke vikalp behad simit ho sakate hai
 The Modi government had two options to bring the economy back on track
 ek he sasta karj
 Due to the decrease in inflation, its land has been prepared
 banking sudhaar kaa saahas or bajet ghate par niyantran do or jaruratein thim jo agar puri ho jaatin to agle saal se byaaj daron main tej katautee kii shuruyaat ho sakati thi
 The second was the huge expenditure of the government, which would be at the cost of high deficit, debt and expensive interest
 arthvyavastha ko mandi se nikaalane ke liye sasta karj, sarkaar ke kharch se behatar vikalp hota he kyonki vah nijee udhyamita ko badhaava detaa he, lekin modi sarkaar ne doosraa vikalp yani baari kharch kaa rasta chunaa he
 The populist make-up of the government will be fine, but the increase in deficit and the risk of corruption and scams will increase manifold
 modi sarkaar, vaajapeyi kii tarah bhagava brigade ko aakraamak sudhaaron se jawaab nahin dena chaahati balki upie kii ek tarah sansadhano kii barbaadi vaali inclusive growth kii oot main chhip janaa chaahati he
 The phantom of aggressive Hindutva, deadlock in Parliament and lack of new revolutionary ideas of reforms are pushing the Modi government towards easy and safe governance options
 aarthik samiksha ishaara kar rahi he ki aane vaala bajet skiimon se bharpoor hoga, jo ghate ko niyantrit karne kaa sankalp nahin dikhayega
 Worn with expectations, the majority government becoming populated so quickly, certainly disappoints, but the fact is that the Modi government has realized the limits of its courage
 agle saal bharat ko 6 fisadi ke aasapaas kii vikaas dar par mutmain hona pad saktaa he, jo aaj kii aabaadi or vishwa bazaar se ekikaran kii roshni main, sattar-assi ke dashak kii 3
 5 percent is equal to the growth rate, which was called the Hindu growth rate
 gavarnence banaam ugr hindutv ke viraat asamanjas main bali to aarthik growth kii hi chadhegi
 If the government wants to provide houses to all the citizens of the country by 2022, then it will have to spend 260 billion dollars or 16,000 billion rupees every year
 kepiemji-neshnal real state deveopment kii report main is baat kaa khulaasa kiya gaya he
 Releasing the report on Wednesday, it was said that about 9500 billion rupees need to be spent every year in real estate, 80 percent of which will be spent on construction of about 7500 billion rupees
 real estate and construction kshetra kii company kepiemji ke niraj bansal kaa kahana he ki 2022 tak sarkaar dwaara har vyakti ko ghar uplabdh karaane ke lakshya par agle aath varsho tak 2,000 arab rupee kharch karne kii jarurat he, jisase nau karod ghar ban paaenge
 Real estate has grown at a rate of two percent in the last few years, but to fulfill the promise made by the government, this rate needs to be raised from 12 to 13 percent
 unhone kaha ki sudhaar ke lakshya ko paane ke liye sansthaanon se vyapak paimaane par karj, privet seaving or videshi puunji ke ucch pravaah kii jarurat he
 The real estate sector is the highest job-providing sector in the country, but it gets only four percent advance

 The Election Commission has sent notice to Amit Shah on the controversial speech given in Shamli of UP and asked him to give his reply
 sutron ke mutabik, ayog ko lagata he ki pratham drushtya main ye chunaav aachaar samhita ke ulanghan kaa maamla he
 The Election Commission has asked Amit Shah to reply by 9 April
 aapako bataa den ki amit shah par pashchimi upi ke shamali main ek sabha main bhadakaau bhaashan dene kaa aarope he
 The Congress had complained against Amit Shah to the Election Commission
 jiske baad unhen notice bhejkar unase jawaab maanga gaya he
 Opposition parties are demanding the arrest of Amit Shah
 congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne kaha ki jab bhadakaau bayaan ke liye imran masood ko giraftaar kiya ja saktaa he to amit shah ko kyon nahin? isse pehle, ravivaar ko amit shah ke khilaaf bijanour main mukadmaa darj kiya gaya tha
 Significantly, Amit Shah had said in a recent meeting in Bijnor of western Uttar Pradesh affected by the Muzaffarnagar riots that the election was to be voted out by the government which paid compensation to those who killed the Jats
 yah badale or izzat kii raksha ke liye he
 Shah's controversial statement comes at a time when rival parties are accusing him of spoiling the atmosphere in the area
 mujffarnagar main pichley saal sitambar main jaaton or musalamaanon ke bich dange kii aag bhadki thi
 More than 40 people were killed in it and more than 50 thousand were rendered homeless
 shah ne shuukravaar ko mujffarnagar dangon ke ek aaropee suresh rana ke saath jaakar gurjar, rajput or dalit netaaon se mulaakaat kii thi
 Shah reportedly told him 'a person can live without food and sleep

 rahul gandhi ko congress adhyaksh pad sanbhale chah maheene ho chuke hai
 The Gujarat assembly election results came only a few days after he became party president
 vahiin, haal main karnataka vidhansabha chunaav ke baad vahaan baari utaar-chadhaav vaala siyaasi ghatnakram party ne dekha
 In Gujarat, the BJP stronghold, the Congress gave it a thorn
 vahiin karnataka main congress ko apane dam par chal rahi satta se haath dhonaa padaa
 After the dramatic events, the Congress succeeded as a junior partner of the JDS to remain in government and prevent the BJP from coming to power
 iftaar se chhavi badalane kii koshishie dekhte hai kirahulrajke 6 maheene main congress kitna badali? kitni majboot hui? khud ko janeudhari shivbhakt hindu brahman bataakar congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne party kaa badla hua najariya jaahir karne kii koshish kii
 During the election campaign, he went to temple and tried to change the pro-muslim image of the party
 beete do saal se party kii ore se band rahi iftaar party kaa silsilaa phir se shuru karke congress kii mul chhavi ko bataane kii ranneeti apanaai
 On June 13, the Iftar party wanted to show that the Congress wants to carry all religions together
 to kya ye party chhavi ke lihaaj se rahul kaa soch samaj kar chalaa gaya daanv he?6 ahm faisleiftaar party se pehle bhirahul gandhi party main 6 aise ahm faisle kiye jinhone bataa diya ki, ab congress main soniaraj nahin rahulraj he
 1
 rahul party main sabase ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaale chaaron frontal sanghathanon ke adhyaksh badal chuke hai
 New presidents of Youth Congress, Mahila Congress, NSUI and Seva Dal have been appointed
 2
 Besides many in-charge, the organization has been given to Ashok Gehlot in place of General Secretary Janardan Dwivedi
 vahiin soniaraj main sanghathan ke duusare sabase taqatvar mahasachiv maane jane vaale digvijay singh ko bhi is pad se mukt kar madhya pradesh main samanvay samiti kaa pramukh banaakar rajya main bhej diya gaya he
 3
 ek vakt sonia gandhi ne adhyaksh rahete ahamed patel or ambika soni ko bataur apana salaahkaar rakhaa
 During Soniaraj in the party, Ahmed Patel remained the advisor till the end
 rahul ke congress adhyaksh banane ke baad kisi netaa se unki khaas kareebi naa dikhe, isliye rahul ne salaahkaar pad par kisi ko nahin rakhaa
 Instead, i established a direct dialogue with the state in-charge
 4
 At the same time, Rahul is also implementing a in-charge formula of a state in the party
 pehle ek prabharee mahasachiv ke paas 3-4 se lekar 10 rajyon tak ke prabhaar hua karte the
 Rahul has changed this to a great extent
 5
 In the recent Rajya Sabha election held on about a dozen seats, Rahul decided that the candidate should also be from the state where the Rajya Sabha seat is held
 isi ke chalate rajeev shukla, pramod tiwari or janardan dvivedi jaise netaa is baar rajyasabha saansad nahin ban paae
 6
 rahul ne congress sanghathan kaa vistaar karte hue fishrman congress, asangathit majdoor kaamgaar congress or profeshnal congress kaa bhi gathan kar diya
 This move is being seen as an attempt to connect people from different regions across the country with the Congress
 is masale par asangathit majdoor kaamgaar congress ke mukhiya arvind singh ne kaha, 'desh main 45 karod log is kshetra main kaam karte hai, ham un sabhi kii samasyaon ko sarkaar ke saamne uthaaenge
 We have established our organization in 20 states
 'saaf he ki rahul ne beete 6 maheene main party main kaaphi kuch badla he yaa badalane kii koshish kii he
 But the outcome of all this will depend on how Rahul's Congress performs in the electoral battle
 aakhirkaar vahiin se yah tay hoga ki rahul ke badlaav hit sabit hote hai yaa flop
 6 Big Challenges Let's now consider the 6 big challenges that Congress President Rahul Gandhi has to tackle in the near future
 1
 So far Rahul has not been able to form the decision-making body working committee of the Congress
 puraane bade chehron ko hataakar nae netaaon ko laane main rahul mashkkat kar rahe hai, isiilie ab tak kaarysmiti gathan nahin kar ho sakaa
 2
 madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh ke vidhansabha chunaav main party ko satta main waapas laane kii chunauti
 The BJP has a government in these three states and the Congress is in the role of the main opposition
 3
 Rahul Gandhi's first stand was that the Congress should be strengthened on its own across the country and stay away from alliances with other parties
 lekin ab badale vakt or siyaasi jarurat ke hisaab se rahul khud bijepi or modi ko rokane ke liye gathbandhan kii vakaalat kar rahe hai
 The second thing is that preparing all the opposition parties for the alliance first and then coming together in a united election will not be less than a test of Rahul's strategic skills
 4
 The big challenge before Rahul is also to become the leader of other opposition parties
 abhi iftaar party main hi is chunauti kii jhalak dikhi, jab sonia kii gaiyr-maujuudagi main bade vipakshi netaaon ne apni duusari or teesri pankti ke netaaon ko bheja
 5
 rahul ke saamne sabase badi chunauti modi-amit shah kii 24X7 sakriy rahane vaali jodi se nipatane kii he
 There is Amit Shah to strategize in the BJP and Modi is the star campaigner
 jabaki, yahaan rahul ko akele hi sab kuch karnaa he
 6
 party khud maanati he ki pehali baar voter banane vaale zyaadaatar modi se prabhavit hai, unke prachaar prasar se man banaate hai
 In order to attract such voters, Rahul below 50 years of age will have to apply heel peak
 congress main sonia raaj ke dauraan ahm jimmedaariyaan nibhaa chuke netaa rajeev shukla ne 'ajtak' se baatcheet main kaha, 'rahul ne party kii kaman abhi sanbhali he or kam vakt main kaaphi behatar badlaav kiye hai
 As far as the candidature of the Leader of the Opposition or PM is concerned, all these things will be decided when the time comes
 aaj to sabhi modi sarkaar se chhutkaaraa chaahate hai

 anupriya ke kaaran hi party ne phulpur, mirzapur or pratapgarh kii siton par pratyaashiyon kaa elaan nahin kiya

 Apna Dal is also considered strong in these seats due to the votes polled in previous elections

 So, the party is very serious about this seat

 ' mumbai ke bandra ke polytechnic college main do din pehle canteen main chaatr-chaatraon ke baithne kii jagah ko ek rassi baandhakar alag kiya gaya
 College principals will soon bring the rule of wearing only salwar suits on girls
 yah faisla vaise to college kii principal ne liya, lekin safai main college prashasan suraksha kaarnon ko is faisle kii vajah bataa rahaa he
 Deputy Principal Sunil Joshi stated that, “there were some incidents of eve-teasing in the college
 canteen main rassi baandhakar ladke-ladakiyon ko alag-alag bithaane kaa faisla aisi ghatnaon ko rokane ke liye liya gaya he
 " yah pabandi sirf college canteen tak hi nahin rukii
 The college is soon going to change the uniform of girl students
 is niyam ke tahat chaatraon ko sirf salwar-suut pahanane kii hi ijaajat hogi
 According to the college, this is being done to protect the students from the disease
 chaatr-chaatraon main is faisle ke khilaaf kaaphi naaraazgi jataai he
 They believe that it is wrong to impose such decisions on them
 jahaan ek ore chaatr-chatraayen saath main baithkar padhate hai to vahiin ve canteen main saath main baithkar khaanaa kyon nahin kha sakate
 College students say that it is wrong to pressurize them to wear salwar suits in this way
 tippaniyan The students also said that this is not the first time that such a decree has been brought by the principal
 isse pehle bhi kai paabandiyaan lagu kii gai hai- jaise chaatraon ko apane bal khule rakhane kii ijaajat nahin, ladke-ladakiyon ko zyada baat karte hue dekhe jane par fine lagane kii dhamkee bhi di jaati rahi he
 Instances of imposing such dictatorial orders on students are often coming from different parts of the country
 lekin mumbai jaise aadhunik shahar main chaatr-chaatraon ko is tarah alag karnaa or chaatraon par unifarm ke naam par pabandi lagane kaa yah vakya chaunkaane vaala he

 This ban did not stop only at the college canteen
 college jald hi chaatraon kii unifarm badalane vaala he
 Under this rule, only girls will be allowed to wear salwar-suits
 college ke mutabik aisa chaatraon ko beemaari se bachaane ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 There is a lot of resentment against this decision among students
 unka maananaa he ki is tarah ke faisle un par thope janaa galat he
 While students and students sit together and study, why can't they eat together while sitting in the canteen
 college kii chaatraon kaa kahana he ki is tarah un par salwar suut pahanane kaa dabaav bananaa galat he
 The comments chaatraon ne yah bhi kaha ki aisa pehali baar nahin hua he ki principal dwaara aisa koi farmaan laayaa gaya ho
 Earlier too many restrictions have been implemented - such as girls are not allowed to keep their hair open, boys and girls have also been threatened to fine when they are seen talking more
 chaatr-chaatraon par is tarah ke taanaashaheepurn farmaan lagane ke vaakye desh ke alag-alag hisson se aksar aate rahete hai
 But in a modern city like Mumbai, this incident of separation of students and banning girl students in the name of uniform is shocking
 chaatr-chaatraon main is faisle ke khilaaf kaaphi naaraazgi jataai he

 BJP has also breathed a sigh of relief after Nitish gave a strong message to his party spokespersons

 From here, the talk of giving ticket to former BJP leader Shatrughan Sinha's wife Poonam Sinha as a coalition candidate is in the air, but it has not been confirmed yet
 vaise yah bhi sach he ki lakhanu ke log kisi celebrity (namchin) ummidavaar par dov lagaana pasand nahin karte hai
 In this line were filmmakers Muzaffar Ali, Miss India Nafisa Ali, famous lawyer Ram Jethmalani, political veteran Dr

 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Aam Aadmi Party fielded Bollywood actor Javed Jaffrey's son of famous comedian Jagdeep

 Let's go a step further and talk about the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the country's well-known lawyer Ram Jethmalani had emerged as an independent candidate in the electoral politics of Lucknow, hitting a strong rock like Atal Bihari Vajpayee, but he was almost paled against Bajpayee
 Got less than three lakh votes

 Karan Singh tried to grow his election crop on the political ground of Lucknow in 1999, but the voters of Lucknow chose Atal Bihari Vajpayee as his first choice

 In the 1996 elections, the people of Lucknow had defied Raj Babbar's election intentions
 vah samaajawaadee party ke tikat par chunaav maidan main utre to unki ek jhalak paane ke liye bheed tut padati thi, lekin parinaam main phir koi badlaav nahin aayaa

 usamen unhone kaha he, ‘aae din dilli se balaatkaar kii ghatnaon ke samachar aate hai, dilli ko rape capital bana diya
 Due to the manner in which Delhi has been made a rape capital, India is being insulted all over the world
 aapke paas maa-bahanon kii suraksha ke liye naa koi yojana he, naa dam he or naa aap iske liye kuch kar rahe hai’
 Modiji, to divert attention from the anarchy spreading in the country, you should not let Parliament run by itself, the daughters of the country want decisive action against the rape and arbitrariness of the day

 All India majlis-e-ittehad-ul-muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi is attacking BJP one after the other in the political battle for Telangana assembly elections
 bijepi ke us vaade ko nishane par liya jisamen telugana bijepi ne pradesh main jeet darj karne par 1 lakh gaay baantne kii baat kahi he
 On this election promise of BJP, Owaisi asked if he too would get a cow or not
 ovaisi ne kaha, 'bijepi ne apane ghoshnaa patr main kaha he ki agar vah telugana main jeet darj karti he to ek lakh gaay baantegi
 Will they give me a cow? i promise to follow it with full religious respect, but will the BJP accept our demand
 hansi kii baat nahin he, bas iske bare main sochen
 'actually, politics has intensified in the last few days about cow
 desh ke kai rajyon main gaay ke naam par mob liching ke maamle bhi saamne aae hai
 From Rajasthan to UP and Gujarat, there have been incidents of violence in the name of cow with people of many Muslim communities
 aise main ovaisi ne bijepi se gaay kii maang karke is mudde ko phir se garma diya he
 Let us tell you that Asaduddin Owaisi was addressing a general meeting in Chandragutta constituency on Sunday
 yahaan se unke chote bhai akbaruddin ovaisi chunaav lard rahe hai
 BJP has pitted the youth leader of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) Shahzad against Akbaruddin on this seat
 jansabha ke dauraan asaduddin ne bijepi kii us 'raajnneeti' par hamalaa bolaa jiske tahat upi or anya bijepi shasit rajyon main shaharon ke naam badale ja rahe hai
 Questioning the bjp's 'motive' behind the name change, Asaduddin Owaisi feared that the move was trying to change history and a conspiracy was being hatched to end the contribution of Muslim rulers
 asaduddin ovaisi ne jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'bijepi kaa yah kaam darshata he ki vah hissedaar yaa barabardaar nahin he balki kirayedar he
 On the demand of BJP leaders to change the names of the cities, Owaisi asked if its leaders would also change the name of Amit Shah
 ovaisi ne kaha, 'shah parsi shabd he
 So it remains to be seen whether the BJP removes Shah from Amit Shah's name
 'gauratlab he ki upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kai shaharon ke naam badalane kaa prastaav aage badha rahe hai
 Recently he has recommended Faizabad to Ayodhya
 iske alaava bijepi ne ahmedabad ko karnavati naam dene kaa prastaav kiya he
 Asaduddin Owaisi has been accused of making 'inflammatory speeches'
 is par unhone safai dete hue kaha ki alpsankhyakon kaa netaa hone ke naate unka jimmaa modi-shah kii jodi kaa pardaafash karnaa he
 Owaisi attacked Shah and said that BJP wants to make India Muslim free
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki aaj desh main alpsankhyakon ko daraane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 In fact, Owaisi was replying to BJP President Amit Shah's statement in which he had spoken about Congress-mukt Bharat and Musjis (MIM) -from Telangana
 raashtrapati ramnath kovind ke abhibhaashan se aaj sansad ke bajet satr kaa aagaaj hua
 In this address, the President presented the achievements of the last four years of the Narendra Modi government in front of the country in a systematic manner
 is dauraan kovind ne jo baaten desh ke saamne rakhin unamem narendra modi sarkaar kaa 2019 kaa agenda bhi jhalka
 PM Modi has many such schemes, which have been targeted by the government to be completed by 2019
 raashtrapati ne abhibhaashan main kaha, ‘sarkaar samaaj ke har tabake tak vikaas pahunchane kii soch ke saath, ‘pradhanmantri gramin sadak yojana’ kaa kaary teji se aage badha rahi he
 In 2014, only 56% of the villages were connected by road connectivity
 ab 82% se zyada gaanv sadakon se jud chuke hai jinamein se adhikansh dur-daraaj ilaakon main hai’
 If the government succeeds in doing this, it will surely get a political advantage in 2019
 khaskar tab jabaki gujarat chunaavon ke baad ye kaha ja rahaa ho ki gramin matadaata bijepi se ruthe hue hai
 Lightened BJP with electricity? The President said in the address, 'with the sensitive thinking that everyone in the country should have a roof over their head and they should have access to water, electricity and toilet facilities, my government will provide every houseless poor family of the country with a house by the year 2022
 Is working on the goal of providing
 pichley saadhe teen varshon main shahari or gramin ilaakon main 93 lakh se adhik gharon kaa nirmaan kiya gaya he
 Under the 'pradhan Mantri Awas yojana-urban', 6 percent relief is being given to the poor for making houses
 bijli-pani jaise mudde hameshaa se chunaav main ahm bhoomika nibhaate hai
 If the government also fulfills half of its target of 2022 by 2019, it will make it easier for the poor and middle class families to garner votes
 garibon kii yojana ke siyaasi phyderashtrapati ne apane abhibhaashan main kaha, har garib ko bharpayt bhojan ke liye banaae gaye rashtriya khaadya suraksha kanoon ke tahat desh ke sabhi rajyon main sasti daron par khadyann dene kii vyavastha he
 Insurance schemes have also been made available to the poor at a premium of Re 1 per month and 90 paise per day
 ab tak 18 karod se zyada garib ‘pradhanmantri suraksha beemaa yojana’ or ‘pradhanmantri jivan jyoti beemaa yojana’ se jud chuke hai
 The Food Security Act is the contribution of the UPA Government, but before its benefit reaches the general public, the Manmohan Government was given a farewell
 garibon kaa beemaa modi sarkaar kii mahatvakankshi yojana he
 If this law and scheme benefits the poor, then BJP will also get its electoral benefit
 ujjwala yojana jeet kaa formularashtrapati ne apane abhibhaashan main kaha, ‘meri sarkaar ne ‘beti bachaao beti padhaao’ yojana shuru kii thi
 In view of the positive results of this scheme, now its scope has been increased from 161 districts to 640 districts
 iske alaava garib mahilaon ko ‘pradhanmantri ujjwala yojana’ ke tahat 3 karod 30 lakh se zyada gas conection die ja chuke hai’
 The BJP has seen the benefits of the Ujjwala scheme in the UP assembly elections
 iskaa dayera badhaakar bijepi apane vot kaa dayera bhi badha sakati he kyonki is yojana se gramin mahilaon ke bich uski gahari paith bani he
 The President of Mudra Yojana and self-employment said in his address, 'my government has insisted on giving loans without bank guarantee for the poor and middle class, especially to promote self-employment
 ‘pradhanmantri mudra yojana’ ke tahat ab tak lagbhag 10 karod rin sweekrut kiye gaye hai or 4 lakh karod rupee se zyada kaa karj diya gaya he
 There are about 3 crore people who have taken advantage of this scheme for the first time and succeeded in starting self-employment '
 mudra yojana ko piem modi apni badi uplabdhi bataate rahe hai, is yojana ke jariye yuvaaon ko lubhaaya ja saktaa he jo ki pehle hi piem modi kaa bada samarthak mana jaataa he
 Recently, Cabinet Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had also answered the question asked about the declining employment on self-employment born of the Mudra scheme
 kisaanon ke sahare 2019 jeetne kii jugatarashtrapati ne apane abhibhaashan main kaha, ‘sarkaar kisaanon kii aay ko 2022 tak doguna karne ke liye patibaddh he
 While the production of urea has increased due to the policies of the government, black marketing of urea has also stopped after 100% neem coating
 ‘pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana’ ke tahat kisaanon ko sasti or saral beemaa seva uplabdh karai ja rahi hai
 'even though the farmer may have been neglected in government policies, it is never ignored in electoral strategy

 pradhanmantri narendra modi dwaara 8 november 2016 ko liye gaye notebandi ke faisle ke baad beete do saalon main 50 lakh logon kii naukariyaan chali gai hai
 According to a new report, 5 million people, especially those working in the unorganized sector, have lost their jobs after demonetisation

 The President of CSE and the lead author who wrote the report, Professor Amit Basole told huffingtonpost that, the report has overall figures

 Jobs may have increased elsewhere, but it is certain that five million people have lost their jobs

 Basole further stated that according to the data, the decline in jobs occurred around demonetisation (over a period of four months between September and December 2016) and reached its constant in December 2018

 In a statement to news agency ANI, Tejapratap Yadav said that 'I talk to Shatrughan Sinha from time to time
