 This novel depicts Bengal from the years 1770 to 1774! From the plot point of view, it is more than a novel or historical novel!

In the plot of 'anandamath' there are ordinary men and women as well as great men! Bankim still shows us the path of nationalism with his characters!

 One is this wide, extremely dark dark forest, at that time of night
 raat kaa doosraa pahar tha
 The night was very black
 jangal ke baahar bhi andhkaar tha, kuch najar nahin aa rahaa tha
 The darkness within the forest was like hell

 Who would say that a man's voice was heard in that forest? After a while, there was a sound again, then the voice of the slipping man was heard, "what will not prove my desire?" Thus three times that dark sea was criticized, then the answer was, "what is your vow?" "" My life-everything

 His wife Kalyani gave up worry and went to Goshala and started milking the cow herself
 phir doodh garam karke bacchee ko pilaayaa, iske baad gaay ko pani-sani dene gayi
 When she came back, Mahendra asked, "how many days will this go on?" "kalyani Boli" "not many days
" jitne din chal sakaa, jitne din main chalaa saki, chalaaungi, iske baad tum bacchee ko lekar shahar chale janaa
 "" If you have to go to the city then why let me suffer so much
 chalo na, isi samay chalate hai
 Both of them started to argue a lot on this topic
 kalyani ne poocha, ‘‘shahar jaakar kya koi vishesh upkaar hoga ?’’mahendra ne jawaab diya, ‘‘shahar bhi shaayad aisa hi jan-shunya or praan-raksha se upaay shunya ho
 "" May our lives be saved by going to Murshidabad, Kasimbazar or Calcutta
 is jagah ko chhodkar janaa to bilkul uchit he

 ’’‘‘agar luutane aa gaye to ham do jane kya choron se dhan ko bachaa paaenge
 Who will consume the money if there is no life left? Come, leave everything here at the same time

 During the journey, Mahendra said, "the path is very inaccessible
 kadam-kadam par lutere gum rahe hai, khaali haath nikalnaa uchit nahin
 Saying this, Mahendra went back to the house and picked up the gun-shot ammo
 yah dekhakar kalyani boli, ‘‘agar astr kii baat yaad aayi he to tum jaraa sukumaari ko pakado, main bhi hathiyaar lekar aati hum
 Saying this, Kalyani put the baby girl in Mahendra's lap and entered the house
 mahendra ne poocha, ‘‘tum bhala koun-sa hathiyaar lekar chalogi ?’’kalyani ne ghar main aakar jehar kii ek choti-si shishi uthaayi or kapade main acchhee tarah chipa lee
 In these days of sorrow, when no one knows about the fate, what is the biggest thing - thinking that Kalyani had already arranged the poison

 Soaking clothes from a lake nearby, Mahendra irrigated himself and Kalyani's mouth, hands and head

 Both of them were able to bear it, but the hunger and thirst of the girl was difficult to bear
 so ve phir raste par chal pade
 Passing that Agneepath, both of them reached a colony before evening
 mahendra ko man hi man aashaa thi ki basti main pahunchakar patni va bacchee ke munh main sheethal jal de sakenge, praan-raksha ke liye do cor bhi naseeb honge
 But where ? Not a single person could be seen in the settlement

 After looking around, Mahendra took the girl to a house and lied

 But he did not get answer from anywhere

 The latest case is of Bindapur area, where the thieves cleaned hands on the service revolver and purse of a policeman
 vaardaat us vakt hui jab pulicekarmi chaowkee main so rahaa tha
 In south west Delhi's Bindapur area, the thieves directly challenged the police and entered the police post and stole an asi's service revolver and purse
 vaardaat ko anjaam dene ke baad chor bade aaraam se faraar ho gaye
 There was a panic in the police department when a theft incident occurred in the police post
 choron kaa shikaar bane eesai kaa naam hoshiyaar singh he
 Based on his statement, the Bindapur police station has registered a case
 ab maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 ASI is also posted in the same police station
 ghatana beeti 26 oktober kii he
 The ASI was on duty from 2 pm to 10 pm
 isi dauraan raat main thane se kol mili ki uttam nagar main kisi ko goli maar di gai he
 As soon as the call was received, ASI Hoshiar Singh went to the scene of the incident and came back after investigating
 subah chaar baje dobaaraa unki duty chhath ghat par thi
 Seeing the morning duty, ASI Hoshiar Singh went to rest at the police post located in Pali Factory
 subah jab unki aankh khuli to dekha ki unki sarvice revolver, paanch jinda kaartoos or purse vahaan se gaayab he
 The purse also contained his I-card, a few rupees, an ATM card and other items
 unhone turantpulicecontrol room ko is baat kii soochna di
 The theft incident in the police post stirred up the police department
 peedit eesai ke bayaan ke aadhaar par bindapur thane main maamla darj kar liya gaya he
 Now the police is investigating the case
 abhi tak choron kaa koi suraag nahin lag paaya he
 The Vishnu Purana states that the Shraddha performed with devotion and devotion, along with the ancestors, and all other ghosts are satisfied
 isliye shraadh main kuch vastuon kaa vishesh mahatv he or kuch kaa nishedh he
 Come, know such important things which are very important to keep in mind during Shradh
 
 
 
 1
 mahatvapurn vastuon main chaandi ke bartan, kush, gau, kaala til hai
 2
 kush or kaala til bhagwaan vishnu ke sharir se utpann maane gaye hai or chaandi bhagwaan shiv ke netron se utpann maani gai gaye he
 3
 mahua or palash ke patr atyant pavitra maane gaye hai
 4
 gaay kaa doodh, gangaajal kaa prayogshraadh ke karmfalko kai guna badha detaa he
 5
 tulsi ke prayog se pitru atyant prasann hote hai
 6
 pitaron kaa varna rajat samaan dhaval or ujjwal hota he isliye unke karm main shwet or halki gandh ke pushpon kaa prayog thik mana jaataa he
 6
 shraadh sthaan ko gobarase lipakar shuddh kiya jaataa he
 Shraddha in the place of pilgrimage is considered to be worth crores of times
 7
 In Shraddha, it is considered to be tamasik, dental intake, tambul intake, oil murders, fasting, female intercourse, drug reception
 8
 Brass and Kansi characters are considered pure
 louh paatr ashuddh maane gaye hai
 9
 gandhon main khas, shrikhand, kapur sahit safed chandan pavitra or saumy maane gaye hai, baaki sabhi ko varjit bataaya gaya hai
 Till now it has been happening only in India
 duniya ke kisi bhi mulk main aisa nahin hota ki kisi jaj kii niyukti koi jaj karata ho
 This sequence, which lasted for nearly twenty years, has now ended here too
 supreme court or hai courtke jajon kii niyuktikolegium systamki jagah abrashtriya nyaayik niyukti ayog(engeesi) ke jariye hogi
 Nature of the Appointments Commission The Chairman of the National Judicial Appointments Commission will be the Chief Justice of India
 hai court ke do varishthatam nyaayadhish, vidhi or nyaay mantri or do prabud vyakti (jinhen pradhanmantri, mukhya nyaayadhish, lok sabha main vipaksh ke netaa yaa sabase bade vipakshi dal ke netaa kii samiti manonith karegi) iske sadsy honge
 Thus the Appointment Commission will have a total of 6 members
 ayog main prabud vyaktiyon kii niyukti keval 3 saal ke liye kii jaaegi jabaki baaki sadsy paden yani apane-apane kaarykaal tak ayog ke sadsy bane rahenge
 One post of two enlightened persons will be reserved for SC, ST, OBC, Minority or Women
 prabud vyaktiyon ko sirf ek baar hi manonith kiya ja sakegaa
 On 31 December, the President approved the Constitution Amendment bill to abolish the collegium system and replace the National Judicial Appointments Commission - and now the notification was issued on 13 April
 kya tha collegium systemsupreme courtor hai court ke nyaayadhishon kii niyukti or sthanantaran kaa nirdhaaran karne vaala wo forum, jo nyaaypalika ke teen faislon kaa nateeja rahaa
 These were known as 'three Judges Cases'
 ‘first jajej cese’ saal 1981 kaa he jisamen supreme court ne faisla diya ki thos tark yaa kaaran ke aadhaar par raashtrapati, chif justise kii sifarish darkinar kar sakate hai
 This decision made the executive powerful over appointments to the judiciary
 ye sthiti 12 saal tak barkaraar rahi
 Thereafter, in the 1993 Second Judges Case, a Constitution Bench of nine judges of the Supreme Court ruled by majority that the provision of consultation with the Chief Justice of India meant seeking his approval
 saath hi faisle main ye bhi kaha gaya ki supreme court ke mukhya nyaayadhish tathaa do varishthatam nyaayadhishon ke ek collegium dwaara ye niyuktiyaan kii jaaengi
 But in 1998, a change was made in the 'third Judges Case' that in the appointment of a Supreme Court Judge, there will be four senior-most judges in the collegium besides the Chief Justice, while in the appointment of a High Court judge, there will be only two senior-most judges as before
 
 collegium kii sifarishpradhanmantri or raashtrapati ko bheji jaati rahi
 Similarly, after consulting the Chief Justice of the High Court Collegium for the High Court, they continued to send the proposal to the State Government
 phir ye prastaav desh ke mukhya nyaayadhish se hota hua pradhanmantri or raashtrapati ke paas pahunchataa - or aakhir main raashtrapati kii sweekruti ke baad sambandhit niyukti kii jaati rahi
 Methods of appointment in other countries as a case of example, the UK has a Judicial Appointments Commission
 jajon ke chayan kii prakriya puri tarah is ayog ke haath main he jo lord chancelar ko naamon kii sifarish bhejtaa he
 The Advocate General recommends appointments in Australia whose advisory committee examines the names
 uske baad mahadhivaktaa governor general ko sifarish bhejte hai
 As far as America is concerned, the President is appointed by the Judge, but he has to undergo a rigorous screening of the Senate Judiciary Committee between the entire public and the press
 is dauraan ye jaanane kii koshish hoti he ki ummidavaar ko desh kii samasyaon or tamaam masalon par rukh kya he, uskaa becoground kya he? ummidavaar ko aise anek sawaalon ke jawaab dene padate hai
 Then there is an appointment somewhere
 rashtriya nyaayik niyukti ayog ko supreme court main chunauti die jane ke baad nyaayalay kii samvidhan peeth 15 april se is par sunwaayee karne ja rahi he

 club) on Dec 11, 2017 at 8:17pm PST a Public Interest Litigation has been filed in the Delhi High Court and the petition has claimed that the condition of Mahatma Gandhi's tomb and its surroundings is very bad
 rajghat gandhi smriti or centre sarkaar iske rakrakhaav par dhyaan nahin de rahi he
 Shyam Narayan, who filed the petition, says that he himself has gone to pay homage at the Samadhi many times

 There is no drinking water
 jagah-jagah kooda failaa hua he
 Dirt also smells
 yachika ke anusaar samadhi par keval tabhi safai hoti jab vahaan koi viypi aata he
 The petitioner has said that apart from Gandhi Smriti, he made several complaints to the Union Urban Ministry regarding this
 lekin abhi tak donon ne is vishay par koi thos kadam nahin uthaaya
 In such a case, the court should issue an order to make proper arrangements here
 yahaan kii badahaal haalat dekhakar kaaphi dukh hota he
 It is a tourist destination
 desh-videsh se log yahaan aate hai
 During the hearing on the public interest litigation filed for the plight of Rajdhat, the Rajghat Samadhi Committee told the High Court that there is adequate system for the maintenance of Samadhi (rajghat) of the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi
 iskaa rakrakhaav uchit tarah se kiya ja rahaa he
 There is minor wear and tear due to people coming daily, which is also fixed regularly
 mukhya nyaayadhish ji
 The committee before the bench of Rohini and Justice Sangeeta Dhingra Sehgal said that the Central Public Works Department is responsible for its maintenance and all the deficiencies located here have been rectified
 aise main rajghat ke badahaal haalat ko lekar daayar yachika ko radd kar diya jaae
 When there is no problem at the tomb, there is no justification for hearing this petition
 ye nyaayalay kii prakriya ke khilaaf he
 In the present case, a person named Shyam Narayan has filed a petition

 The results of the Lok Sabha elections have given her a shock whether she will be able to come back after winning the election again
 'kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki vidhansabha chunaavon main gambhir khatre se nipatane ke liye mamata banerjee 2021 se pehle chunaav kar sakati hai

 The question of whether or not Yakub Memon, convicted of the 1993 bomb blasts, will be hanged on July 30 remains intact
 kyonki yaqub kii yachika par sunwaayee kar rahe supreme court ke jaj justise courier joseph ne kai bade sawaal uthaa die
 These questions have also been raised not on anyone but the Supreme Court
 sunwaayee ke dauraan unhone kaha ki 21 july ko curative petishan kii sunwaayee main unhen bhi shaamil kiya janaa chahie tha kyonki niyamon ke mutabik supreme court ke teen varisht jajon ke alaava wo bench bhi shaamil honi chahie jisane aakhri main cese ko suna tha
 However, the Central and Maharashtra governments continued to give their arguments
 sarkaar kii ore se atorni general mukul rohtagi ne kaha ki jis bench ne faansee kii sajaa barkaraar rakhi thi, wo donon jaj justise sadashivam or justise bies chouhan ritair ho chuke hai
 But Justice Kurien said that he was involved in the bench which had heard the review petition for ten days
 aise main unhen or justise chelmeshwar ko curative petishan kii sunwaayee main shaamil kiya janaa chahie tha
 On July 21, Chief Justice HL Dattu, Justice TS Thakur and Justice Anil r Dave rejected the curative petition of Yakub
 haalanki wo yaqub kii punarvichaar yachika kii sunwaayee kar rahi bench kii agavaai kar rahe the, lekin curative main wo varishthata ke aadhaar par shaamil hue the
 Rohatgi said that the issue here is only about the death warrant yaqub memon ke paas koi kanoonee rasta nahin bachaa
 The Governor and the President have rejected his mercy petition
 supreme court bhi punarvichaar or curative petishan khaarij kar chukaa he
 However, Raju Ramachandran, appearing on behalf of Yakub, said that the death warrant was issued on 30 April while the jailer later told Yakub that he could file a curative petition if he wanted
 iske baad 12 may ko yaqub kii ore se curative petishan daakhil kii gai
 But according to the Supreme Court Judgment, these death warrants are illegal

 During the hearing, he said that he should have been included in the curative petition hearing on July 21 as per the rules, besides the three senior judges of the Supreme Court, the bench which had heard the case in the last should also be included
 haalanki centre or maharashtra sarkaar apni daleelein detii raheen
 On behalf of the government, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi said that the bench which upheld the death sentence, both the judges Justice Sadasivam and Justice BS Chauhan have retired
 lekin justise courion ne kaha ki wo us bench main shaamil the jisane das dinon tak punarvichaar yachika par sunwaayee kiya tha
 As such, he and Justice Chelameswar should have been included in the curative petition hearing
 gauratlab he ki 21 july ko chif justise echel dattu, justise tii es thakur or justise anil aar dave ne yaqub kii curative petishan khaarij kii thi
 Although he was leading the bench hearing Yakub's reconsideration petition, he joined the curator on the basis of seniority
 rohtagi ne kaha ki yahaan mudda sirf deth warrant ko lekar uthaa he Yakub Memon had no legal way left
 rajyapal or raashtrapati uski dayaa yachika khaarij kar chuke hai
 The Supreme Court has also dismissed reconsideration and curative petitions
 lekin, yaqub kii ore se pesh hue raju ramchandran ne kaha ki deth warrant 30 april ko jari hua jabaki baad main jailer ne hi yaqub ko bataaya ki wo chaahe to curative petishan daakhil kar saktaa he
 After this, on May 12, a curative petition was filed by Yakub
 lekin supreme court ke jajment ke hisaab se ye deth warrant gaiyr-kanoonee he
 However , the opinion of Justice Anil R

 Mumbai Indians bowling coach and mentor Sean Pollock, who was in a state of exits due to a loss in the first match and rain in the second match, said that his team's fate is no longer in his own hands
 polock ne yarkshar ke khilaaf match barish ke kaaran radd hone ke baad kaha, yah hamaare liye niraashajanak he
 The Lions have won two matches and the way the program is designed they have to play before us, which means that we are no longer in the hands of qualifying for the semi-finals
 unhone kaha, yah thodaa niraashajanak he
 If they win this match, it will be their third win, while the Sydney Sixers have already won three matches
 aise main yadi ham apane baaki do maichon main jeet bhi darj karte hai, tab bhi hamaare keval 10 ank hi honge
 We were supposed to win this match, but you cannot control the weather
 durbhaagya se ham pehla match nahin jeet paae the
 The comments polock ne yah maanane se inkaar kar diya ki unki gendbaaji bahut had tak mishael johnson or lasith malinga kii tej gendbaaji kii jodi par nirbhar he
 He said, Dhawal Kulkarni bowled really well in the last match he played in the IPL against Chennai Superkings and so there were chances from him
 is purv dakshin africa captain ne yah baat maanane se bhi inkaar kar diya ki ipel timen champions lig main sangharsh kar rahi hai
 He said, in a match played by Delhi Daredevils, he won
 chennai superkings ne vaisaa khel nahin dikhaaya, jaisi ki usase ummid thi
 We have lost only one match
 yadi aap keker ko dekho, to vah kolkata main kaaphi safal rahi he, jahaan kaa wicket uske gendbaaji akraman ke anukool he, lekin yahaan kaa wicket aisa nahin he
 "it's disappointing for us," Pollock said after the match against Yorkshire was canceled due to rain
 lines ne do match jite hai or jis tarah se kaarykram banaaya gaya he, unhen hamase pehle khelnaa he, jiskaa matlab he ki semifinal ke liye kwalifai karnaa ab hamaare haath main nahin he
 He said, this is a little disappointing
 yadi ve yah match jeet jate hai, to unki yah teesri jeet hogi, jabaki sidney sixrs pehle hi teen match jeet chuki he
 So even if we win our remaining two matches, we will still have only 10 points
 hamen yah match jeetna tha, lekin aap mausam par niyantran nahin rakh sakate
 Unfortunately we did not win the first match
 tippaniyan Pollock refused to believe that his bowling was largely dependent on the fast bowling pair of Mitchell Johnson and Lasith Malinga
 unhone kaha, dhaval kulkarni ne chennai superkings ke khilaaf ipel main jo aakhri match khelaa tha, usamen vastav main acchhee gendbaaji kii thi or isliye usase sambhaavnaaen thim
 The former South African captain also refused to believe that the IPL teams were struggling in the Champions League
 unhone kaha, dilli dairedevills ne jo ek match khelaa he, usamen usne jeet darj kii
 Chennai Superkings did not play as expected
 hamane keval ek match ganvaaya he
 If you look at KKR, it has been very successful in Kolkata, where the wicket suited its bowling attack, but the wicket here is not like that

 Like Rana, Uthappa also had poor luck, who was forced to return to the pavilion after a brilliant fielding by Raina with a straight throw on the wickets
 rinku singh sirf do ran banaakar pavilion laut liye

 'the Prime Minister said,' Therefore it is right that someone should give birth, someone should take care of them
 ' He said, 'this is a victory of the high traditions of Indian democracy

 This is due to the contribution of all the governments of the past and present and therefore who won and who lost

 On 9 August, many atrocities were perpetrated on the freedom fighters

 ) uttar pradesh main basapa or sapa ke gathbandhan main congress ko jagah nahin diye jane kii khabaron ke bich congress ke varisht netaa salmaan khurshid ne ravivaar ko kaha ki agar unki party ko gathbandhan main shaamil nahin kiya gaya to rashtriya str par bhaajapa virdohi morcha kamjor hoga or isse ‘‘paidaa hote hi mit jane'' jaisi sthiti utpann ho sakati he
 Khurshid said that forming a grand alliance in Uttar Pradesh would be the most complicated exercise for all opposition parties
 lekin bhaajapa ke saamne ek badi chunauti pesh karne liye congress, basapa, sapa or rashtriya lok dal (ralod) ke liye haath milaanaa jaruri he
 In an interview to pti-language, the former Uttar Pradesh Congress chief said that there are situations like instability in the state and the party chief Rahul Gandhi is keeping an optimistic outlook with an open heart and mind for the alliance in the 2019 general election
 jab in khabaron ke bare main poocha gaya ki uttar pradesh main sapa or basapa gathbandhan se congress ko baahar rakh sakati he to unhone kaha, ‘‘main samajhataa hum ki bas thodaa bahut tevar dikhaane kii baat he lekin main aisa pakkaa nahin kah saktaa
 
 mere paas iske sach yaa jhooth maanane kaa koi kaaran nahin he lekin yadi congress ko uttar pradesh main gathbandhan se baahar rakhaa jaataa he to yah adoordarshee hoga kyonki rashtriya str par bade gathbandhan par iskaa asar ho saktaa he
 "if Uttar Pradesh does not contribute to a comprehensive grand alliance at the national level, then at the national level, the alliance will be weak and a situation like this can be erased as soon as it is born
 '' purv kendriya mantri ne kaha, ''ham sabhi ko kahin na kahin kuch samjhauta karnaa hoga or sirf lene-lene yaa dene-dene se baat nahin banegi
 If the transaction between the four parties is correct, then we will be able to fight the BJP well
 agar aisa nahin hua to yah aitihaasik nuksaan hoga
 "khurshid's statement comes amid claims made in the news that the BSP and SP are preparing an alliance for the Lok Sabha elections without the Congress
 congress ne in khabaron ko afvaah bataate hue khaarij kar diya he
 The BSP has also rejected these claims
 yah puche jane par ki haal hi main hindi pattee ke rajyon madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main mili jeet ke baad congress ko uttar pradesh main kya ummide hai
 Khurshid said that the situation in Uttar Pradesh is different because the party has been away from power for a long time
 teen rajyon main mili jeet ke baad rahul gandhi ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saamne gambhir pratidwandvi ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 To this, Khurshid said that Rahul Gandhi has taken the lead and the result is in front of everyone
 khurshid ne kaha ki rajyon ke chunaavon main mili jeet se kabhi haar nahin maanane kaa sandesh mila he
 a few weeks before the case was registered, the Supreme Court disqualified Sharif as Prime Minister on July 28 in the Panama Papers case

 ) India's great cricketer Rahul Dravid on Friday retired from Test cricket and said goodbye to his 16-year international career
 rahul dravid kaa ab tak kaa safarpurv bhartiya captain dravid test cricket ke itihaas main sabase zyada ran banane vaale duusare khilaadi hai or kai varshon se bhartiya madhyakram kii jimmedaari sambhaal rahe the
 The 29-year-old Dravid became the first player to retire in three aging Indian cricket players (sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman) after a disappointing Test tour to Australia
 dravid ne bangalore main jari ek press conferes main kaha ki main antarrashtriya or gharelu pratham shrenee cricket se sanyas lene kii ghoshnaa karata hum
 i played my first Test for India 16 years ago and today i feel that the time has come to move forward
 main bharat main ek aise ladke kii tarah hi tha jo apane desh kii ore se khilne kaa sapana dekhtaa he
 i never thought that my journey would be so long and so perfect
 dravid ke saath bisisiai adhyaksh en shrinivasana or purv bhartiya captain anil kumble bhi maujuud the
 He said that no dream can be fulfilled alone
 main un logon kaa shukriya adaa karnaa chaahunga jinhone mujhe cricket sikhaaya or mujh par bharosa rakhaa
 My junior coaches in Bangalore and various junior national camps made me so obsessed with cricket
 dravid ne kaha ki antarrashtriya str par mere kochon ne meri cricket main sudhaar kiya or jisase mere vyaktitv ko nikharane main madad mili
 Physicians and trainers worked hard to make me fit, which is not an easy task, due to which i continued to play even in the last stages of 30 years
 unhone kaha ki bharat main chayankartaaon ko kabhi bhi koi shrey nahin miltaa lekin unhone kai baar mujh par bharosa jataayaa balki itnaa bharosa mujhe khud par nahin tha or main iske liye unka shukraguzaar hum
 All the captains i played led, led and inspired me
 sabase zyada main un tiimon kaa shukriya adaa karnaa chaahunga, jinke saath main khelaa
 Dravid said he has many wonderful memories associated with his teammates, including some of the greatest players in the game
 unhone kaha ki main karier ke shuru ke dinon main karnataka kii team se khelaa or ve saal mere liye kaaphi manoranjak or sikh hasil karne vaale rahe
 He said that in the Indian team i was fortunate to be a part of that glorious era in which India played some of the best cricket at home and abroad
 team ke kai saathi mahaan ban gayi, bharat main hi nahin balki puri cricket duniya main
 i admire him a lot, i have learned a lot from him and i am saying goodbye to cricket with great memories of my time spent with him and a strong friendship, it is a great gift
 uttarakhand aapadaa ke peediton ko abhi muaavje bhi puure nahin baante gaye, lekin pradesh sarkaar ne apni chhavi chamakaane ke liye vigyapanon par hi 22 karod rupee kharch kar daale
 This is the situation when only 1 of the disaster victims
 5 karod rupee kii raahat hi banti gai he or pradesh main bade str par nirmaan kaary kiya janaa he
 That is, the Vijay Bahuguna government is showing more speed in brightening its image than providing relief
 aapadaa ke baad uttarakhand behad mushkil halaat se guzar rahaa he
 The damaged infrastructure has to be repaired anew
 kshatigrast padi hai 250 sadaken or 150 pulartiai se mili jaankaree ke mutabik, uttarakhand sarkaar ne kedarnath puja par 1 karod 11 lakh, hemkund par 56 lakh, yamunotri par 87 lakh or rashtriya khaadya yojana par 7 karod ke vigyaapan de daale
 Whereas in Kedarghati, relief and rehabilitation work has not yet started properly
 250 sadaken band hai, 150 pul abhi banane hai or sardiyaan aane se halaat or mushkil hone vaale hai
 The government is trying to make the image shine
 People in distressed areas are forced to live in tents and the Chief Minister and the government are busy in brightening their image
 sarkaar chaahati he ki vigyapanon ke jariye puure desh main yah sandesh jaae ki congress sarkaar kii saraparasti main devbhumi main sab kuch saamaanya ho gaya he
 Advertisement was necessary to increase tourism: CM When Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna was asked about this, he said, 'how much was spent on advertisements, i do not know
 lekin aapadaa ke bare main desh ko jaankaree dene ke liye yah jaruri tha
 People from all over the country were stranded here
 hamaari arthvyavastha mukhya rup se paryaton par aadhaarit he, isliye hamane desh bhar ke logon ko maujuuda sthiti kii jaankaree di
 Asked whether it was an attempt to shine the image, Bahuguna said that we just wanted to tell how the disaster came and how people were saved
 yah chhavi chamakaane kii niti nahin he
 We have just given information to the people
 saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki unki chhavi koi nahin bigaad saktaa
 The first biography of Kabir Das was written by the Vaishnava monk Anantadas towards the end of the sixteenth century
 is jeevani main ek jagah ve yaad karte hai ki kis prakaar kaashi ke panditon or moulanaon kaa ek pratinidhimandal sikandar lodhi ke paas kabir das kii svachhndatha kii shikaayat lekar gaya tha
 These religious gurus had complained that Kabir, being a rational Indian, refuses to believe any holy scripture to be divine, and test the common sense and wisdom gained from day-to-day life
 All insist on tightening the words and traditions
 swaabhaavik he ki ve sab log kabir das se khafa the
 The influential people of Kashi said that all this cannot go on and Kabir will have to be taken out of Kashi, because "as long as this weaver stays in Kashi, no one will listen to us
" ''sabhi adhinayakawadi vichaardhaaraein sawaal poochne vaale logon—buddhijiviyon—ko khatra maanati hai
 On the contrary, fear and hatred of such people is clearly a sign of totalitarian ideology, even if it takes the support of religion, history or nation to justify itself

 American science fiction writer and astrophysicist Gregory Benford in his newcomqub-benford Law parody 'law of Controversy' states that totalitarian thinking relies on passion: "passion is the inverse of the real information available
" ''raajnneeti preritahindutwabhi iskaa apwaad nahin he, yah ho bhi nahin saktaa
 This can be acceptable only when the passion is on the sky, so there is a constant effort to create impatience and it constantly urges emotions that have nothing to do with facts or information
 'hindu bhaawanaaon' ke naam par sab kuch jaij ho jaataa he
 Like its counterparts in other religions, 'hidutva' claims that it represents the culture and interests of its followers, it is called 'cultural nationalism' which is quite different from 'geographical nationalism'

 Savarkar says it openly: 'hinduize' is only a derivative of Hindutva, a part, a fragment
 ''saavarkar aise pehle or sambhawatah ekmaatr hindutv vichaarak the jinhone hindutv ko paribhaashit karne kaa ksht kiya or 1928 main ''hindutvah hindu koun he?'' sheershak ek pustika jari kar iske ghatakon or orientation kii vyakhya kii

 Savarkar was desperate to bring the rich structure of Hindutva under a one-way definition

 He writes: Hindutva is not, as implicitly indicated by the term Hinduism
 iske alaava 'ism' kaa aam taur par matlab kisi aise siddhant yaa samhita se hota he jo kuch had tak kisi aadhyatmik siddhant yaa vyavastha par nirbhar karata ho
 But when we try to define the essential importance of Hindutva, we do not mean primarily or primarily by any particular theological doctrine or creed

 Cow protection is not a sacrosanct emotion, it seems to be a political advantage of a certain brand of 'cultural nationalism'
 saavarkar kaa hindutv bauddhik dridhtaa se utana sambandhit nahin he jitna ki junun ko bhadakaae rahane se
 His idea was somehow to keep Muslims and Christians out of the purview of the nation, so he brought up the idea of 'virtuous land' as a real cut of patriotism

 Golwalkar in his book Bunch of Thoughts (1966) takes this to the next logical culmination when he considers 'muslims', 'christians' and 'communists' as an 'internal threat' to the nation instead of poverty, deprivation and structural injustice
 (chapter 12)
 swaabhaavik he ki unke liye bharat kaa swatantraaa sangram andolan apane aap main 'pratikriyaavaadi' tha, 'kyonki isamen british virodh ko deshbhakti or rashtrawaad mana ja rahaa tha (pej 143)'
 Women advocates of Hindutva may be surprised to learn that Golwalkar associates the idea of women empowerment (including that of Hindus) with communalism and casteism: "now 'equality for women' and 'the liberation of men from domination' Uproar has begun The reservation of seats on the basis of the separate gender of women in various positions of power is being claimed, thus adding a new 'instrumentalism' in the order of casteism, communalism and linguism

 In the year 2002, i was addressing a group of students at Columbia University
 ek bhadke hue yuva hindu america ne sawaal kiyah 'aakhir muslim or isai (uskaa matlab bharat main rahane waalon se tha) makka yaa rome kii jagah bharat ko apni pavitra bhoomi kyon nahin maanate?'' maine usase poocha ki kya usne kabhi ganga main dubkee lagaai he? usne kaha ki nahin, usne to nahin lekin uske maa-baap har saal ganga main dubkee lagaate hai
 To this i asked, "why don't they dive into the Hudson to prove their patriotism towards America?" The young man was aghast, he had probably never been shown a mirror like this before
 maine usase kaha ki vah ishwar ko is baat ke liye dhanyavad de ki uske saathi america naagarik hindutv ke is vichaar kaa isai sanskaran nahin apana rahe
 Not only that 'proud' NRI Hindu but every sensitive person living anywhere in the world should know that nationalization of religion is neither good for any religious creed nor for the idea of nation

 fasebuk ne data li kiya he
 There is a debate in this India that is making an Aadhaar card without thinking in line
 jahaan log na privesi kaa matlab samajhate hai or na data kii dakaiti kaa khel
 Aadhaar number data is secured between a wall five feet wide and 13 feet high
 ise koi bhed nahin saktaa, aisa daawa karne vaali sarkaar ke paas agar suraksha ke itane hi majboot intazaam hai to kya vah bataa sakati he ki usne logon kii nijee jaankaree ko churaane ke koun se maamle pakade hai
 Data theft cases are being reported on Google, Facebook worldwide
 mukademe chal rahe hai
 What the Indian government can tell if it has caught a similar case against Google and Facebook
 kya ham yah maan len or kyon maan len ki bharat main fasebuk or google ne koi gadabadi nahin kii hogi
 This question was raised because on Wednesday, the IT minister was speaking in great enthusiasm
 unhone kaha ki mistar mark zukarbarg, aap bharat ke iti mantri kii pratikriya ko note kar len, ham bharat main fasebuk kaa swaagat karte hai, lekin agar fasebuk system kii mileebhagat se bharatiyon kaa data chori hua he to yah bardaasht nahin kiya jayega
 Our IT Act is very strict
 ham uskaa istamaal kar sakate hai, aapako bhi bharat bula sakate hai
 We have a very strong structure
 lekin aaj main apni chetavanee atlantic paar sudur california tak suna dena chahta hum
 The text that has been said in English does not reflect in the translation, but still the Minister would have been better to give the statement 'are o Sambha Type', telling that India has ever made a case against Google and Facebook, theft
 Caught like the European Union in June 2017 against Google 2
 4 billian euro kaa jurmaana kiya tha, kyonki google galat tareekon se apana varchasv bana rahaa tha
 At the time of Net Neutrality, the Government of India had definitely brought Facebook on its way because at that time Facebook had started provoking people against the government by advertising in newspapers here
 is ghatana ko bhi ham bhul chuke hai
 People also raised this matter first, there was a lot of debate then the government came into it
 fasebuk, crambridge analitica se judi bahes bahut gambhir he
 This should be understood carefully
 bharat main kanoon to he, lekin kya use lekar hamaari aapaki samaj he
 Tomorrow, when someone goes to the election game with the help of Aadhaar number, then how will you and we understand that public opinion was reversed through these information
 ham kaise samajhenge ki jo hua wo galat tha, uske liye hameen zimmedaar the, hamane hi jaankaree de di thi or uske baad yah sabit kaise hoga
 Is the Election Commission ready for such situations
 bharat jaise desh main har chunaav main kisi na kisi kii sex tivi channelon par chalane lagati he, us desh main hamaare netaa privesi ke export banakar bhaashan de rahe hai
 Assuring the public that your data means your information is safe
 aap apane shahar ke kisi bhi sibar cell main chale jaaiye
 Look at his condition and then you will know what arrangements India has made
 puri duniya main bahes chal rahi he ki kahin baahar kaa desh, companiyon kaa giroh milakar hamaare aapke data se chunaav kaa nateeja hi na badal de
 The matter was debated in the Supreme Court in September last year
 us vakt sarkaar ne sitambar 2017 main smart phone banane vaali 21 companiyon se poocha tha ki aapke mobile phone main data kitna surakshit he
 Whats Up had told the Supreme Court that it would not give its data to any third party
 isi main sarkaar ne supreme court ko bataaya ki usne data kii suraksha ke liye ek cameti banaai he
 On 23 January 2018, the Center has told the Supreme Court that the committee constituted under the chairmanship of Retired Justice BN Srikrishna, the bill will be ready by March
 yani bharat abhi kaaphi peeche he
 The governments of the world have already awakened
 america main hue raashtrapati chunaav, italy, france or germany ke chunaavon ke dauraan hi vahaan charchaa chal padi ki rus unke chunaavon ko badalane kii takat rakhata he
 Through technology and data, he is influencing elections
 jhooth or nafrat kii baton kaa jor-shor se prachaar hota he, jiske prabhaav main nattejey badal jate hai
 Especially the European Union felt that Russia was affecting the unity of the European Union by interfering in every election
 european union ko tod rahaa he
 Particularly the separation of Britain is also being linked to the use of data
 sochie bharat main chunaav ho rahe hai or hamaare data se america tay kar rahaa ho ki koun se dal ko bahumat milanaa chahie taaki uski sarkaar banane ke baad wo manachaahe dhang se nitiyaan bana sake
 Would you like to european union ke 28 deshon ne apane yahaan hone vaale chunaavon ko bachaane ke liye data protection kanoon banaaya he
 You know that Facebook technology is headquartered in Ireland by many technology company of USA, because the law of other countries was not applicable in Ireland
 european union ne kanoon ke zarie is vyavastha ko badal diya he
 Now the rules made by the European Union were to apply to these companies
 germany ne bhi apane kanoon kaaphi sakht kiye hai
 a few years ago, Belgium dragged Facebook to court in violation of privacy data law
 britain kii sansad main ek cameti bani he ki soshal media kaa chunaavon par kya prabhaav pad rahaa he, vahaan information kamishnar offis he jo aise maamalon kii jaanch karata he
 India claims that its laws are strict but it is lagging far behind
 kisi zile main tanaav ho jaae to sidhaa internet band karnaa padataa he
 Elements that have to be shut down have ever been punished on the basis of these strict laws or not, its record will be very poor
 pichley saal sitambar main supreme court main is par bahes hui thi
 Whats up then said that it does not give user data to any third
 sarkaar ne smart phone banane vaali 21 companio se poocha tha ki aapke yahaan data kitna surakshit he
 Committee on Data Protection headed by Retired Justice BN Srikrishna
 abhi janvari maheene main sarkaar ne supreme court ko bataaya he ki isaki report ke baad march tak data protection kaa bill taiyaar ho jayega
 That is, we are not ready yet, we are preparing
 kya aap chahenge ki rus yaa america hamaara aapkaa data lekar aisa chunavi campan chalaa de jiske jhaanse main ham sab aa jaaen or ham aisi sarkaar chun len jo baad main hamaari hi jeb kaatane lage
 Make it difficult to live isi ko kehete hai ki data se chunaav prabhavit kiya ja rahaa he
 Yet many people do not understand how elections can be affected
 hamane yahi sawaal rakesh se poocha jo belatbox india naam kii sanstha chalaate hai
 We are a new institution, we do not know much
 ab aate hai maujuuda vivaad par
 You know that since Trump won, the United States has been investigating whether Russia interfered in this election, meaning that Russia ran a propaganda on its behalf that benefited Trump
 maan lijie bharat main das companiyaan kisi netaa ko apana banty samajhati hon, ki banty ko jeeta den or baad main banty hamaari siti par kaam karegaa
 Bunty wins, a lion will be there in front of you but will remain silent in front of companies
 isiilie duniya bhar main research chal rahaa he ki kahin data ke istamaal se loktantr hi na samaapt ho jaae
 It is being understood that what is wrong, what is right
 lekin bharat main congress or bijepi is tarah ek duusare par aarope laga rahi hai jaise in donon ne sabakuch samaj liya ho
 In December 2016, Carole Cadwalladr, a US design professor, during her research found Cambrian Analita's role in the US election and her connection to the campaign to separate Britain from the European Union
 cambridge analitica ko 5 karod se adhik amareeki nagarikon kaa data ek research se mila
 This researcher had created an app, which people associated with their consent
 jaise fasebuk par bahut se ap aate hai, aap clic kar judane lag jate hai or ai agri kaa batan dabaa dete hai
 Either you do not understand or become careless, on the other hand, the app takes all your information and sells it to a third party
 vah company us data kaa istemaal raajnneetik kii hawa badalane main karti he yaa kisi product ko bechney main karti he
 This is what happened in this dispute
 ab paanch dinon tak fasebuk ke mark zukarbarg ne mana ki bahut badi galati ho gai he
 Arrangements will be made for this to not happen from now on
 data or privesi se jude log kehete hai ki yah kaaphi nahin he
 It should not be possible to tell Zuckerberg that what the app that stole data before 2014 is doing what they are doing, because the number of apps is in thousands
 ham or aap fasebuk kaa istemaal karte hai
 There is a trust, but if the information gets passed on to someone else, then the trust is broken
 or us jaankaree kaa istemaal aapke raajnneetik mat ko prabhavit karne main rus yaa america main baithi koi company kar le to sidhaa matlab yah hua ki loktantr technolji ke kaaran kabhi bhi khatre main pad saktaa he
 You see that this is happening in many places
 ek baar jo satta main aa rahaa he, wo haar hi nahin rahaa he
 Look at the President of Russia, Putin, the President of China has sat on the throne for a lifetime
 bharat main koi is tarah kaa sapana na dekhe isliye janata ko is vishay ko lekar satark ho janaa chahie
 This is the issue of Facebook, but you should think that due to Aadhaar number, this danger is not close
 america, italy, france or germany main aadhaar number nahin he, bharat main aadhaar number he
 Lest democracy should run out in the name of saving subsidies
 britain main maamla uthaa to vahaan kaa chunaav ayog turant jaanch karne laga, bharat main congress bijepi aarope laga rahe hai, khuleam kah rahe hai ki aapane aisa kiya to aapane aisa kiya
 But the Election Commission does not know
 kya pataa uske adhikaar kshetra main hi yah na aata ho
 Whenever the question of evms is hacked in India, we make fun
 sabase badi daleel he ki chunaav ayog par shaq kaise kar sakate hai
 We should not forget that during this election commission booths were looted for decades
 ayog ne nahin, ek vyakti ne ayog ko bharose laayak banaaya tha
 Do you think that people do not have faith in the Election Commission of America, France, Italy, Germany
 phir bhi vahaan bahes ho rahi he ki technalji se kahin riselt yaa chunaav kii prakriya ko prabhavit to nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 There was a lot of discussion before the general election in Germany
 vahaan ke fedral offis for di protection of di constitution ke pramukh ne kaha tha ki chunaav ko hack karnaa, baahar se prabhavit karnaa bilkul sambhav he
 Was reading a report that said there is a counting software in Germany which is pc-wahl, it can be hacked
 iske data ko ched kar riselt badla ja saktaa he
 Such questions are taken seriously in those countries, this is the answer to all such questions here, how can we doubt the Election Commission
 yahi puch lijie ki chunaav ayog ke paas aisi sambhaavna ko rokane ke liye system hi kya he
 Rakesh of Balletbox India had recently written a long letter and warned against these dangers, but got the same answer, but now the answer is beginning to be understood
 tippaniyan This is a complex issue but easy to understand
 kya hoga ki aap sahmati se apni jaankaree kisi ap ko de den, or vah uskaa istamaal kisi or kaam ke liye kar le
 As in the case of Crambin Analytica
 logon ne khud hi cambridge uniwarsity ke researchan kogan ko jaankaree di
 He definitely sold it to Cambridge Analytica
 itani jaldi se congress bijepi ke khel main mat padie
 Worry about hard-earned democracy
 bharat main har dal ab data kaa istemaal kar rahaa he
 That is why in every election you will see that lies have been dominated
 har jhooth duusare jhooth se bada hota he
 Sources at Cambridge Analytica Company in India are now joining Amrish Tyagi, son of JDU leader Casey Tyagi
 cambridge enelitica company ke sansthaapak alexander nix ne bharat main stritgic communication leboratory banaai
 Nix was seen together with two people, one of whom is Avnish Rai and the other is Amrish Tyagi, KC Tyagi's boys
 avanish raay ne shrinivasana jain se baat kii or vistaar se bataaya ki kaise nix kii ruchi bharat ke chunaav main thi
 Initially, Nix had said that he had come to talk of data collection for Congress but later came to know that he was working to defeat Congress
 avanish yah bhi bataa rahe hai ki ap bana kar kaise data ikaitha kiya or us data kaa host koun hoga is par vivaad hua
 Avnish has now become a whistle blower in this case
 aap inkaa intervyuu suniye, hosh ud jaaenge
 Nix said that he meant only by doing business, he came from earning money
 yah sawaal isliye kiya kyonki buudhvaar ko iti mantri kaaphi josh main bol rahe the
 He said that Mr
 Mark Zuckerberg, take note of the response of the IT Minister of India, we welcome Facebook in India, but it will not be tolerated if Indians' data is stolen due to connivance with the Facebook system
 hamaare iti act kaaphi sakht hai
 We can use it, you can also call India
 hamaare paas kaaphi majboot dhaancha he
 But today i want to hear my warning across the Atlantic to remote California
 jis tevar se angrezi main kaha gaya he wo tevar anuwaad main to nahin jhalkata he magar phir bhi mantri ji 'are o sambha tip' bayaan dene se acha hota ki bataa dete ki bharat ne google or fasebuk ke khilaaf kabhi koi mukadmaa kiya he, chori pakadi he jaise european union ne june 2017 main google ke khilaaf 2
 4 billion Euros was fined, because Google was dominating in wrong ways
 net neutrality ke vakt bharat sarkaar ne zarur fasebuk ko raste par laa diya tha kyonki us vakt fasebuk yahaan ke akhabaaron main vigyaapan dekar sarkaar ke khilaaf hi logon ko uksaane laga tha
 We have also forgotten this incident
 yah maamla bhi logon ne pehle uthaaya, khub bahes hui tab jaakar sarkaar isamen ai
 The debate related to Facebook, Cambridge Analytica, is very serious
 ise dhyaan se samajha janaa chahie
 There is a law in India, but do we understand you about it? kal jab koi aadhaar number ke sahare chunavi khel kar jaae, tab aap or ham kaise samajhenge ki in jaankariyon ke zarie janamat ko palat diya gaya
 How can we understand that what happened was wrong, we were responsible for it, we had given information and after that how it will be proved
 kya chunaav ayog aisi paristhitiyon ke liye taiyaar he
 In every election in a country like India, some kind of sex starts running on TV channels, in that country our leaders are giving speeches as privacy experts
 janata ko aashwast kar rahe hai ki aapkaa data yani aapaki jaankaree surakshit he
 Go to any cyber cell in your city
 uski haalat dekh lijie phir pataa chalegaa ki bharat ne kya intazaam kiye hai
 There is a debate all over the world that somewhere outside the country, the gang of companies together do not change the result of the election from our data
 pichley saal sitambar main is maamle ko lekar supreme court main bahes hui thi
 At that time, in September 2017, the government had asked 21 companies making smart phones that how secure is the data in your mobile phone
 whats ap ne supreme court se kaha tha ki vah kisi bhi third party ko apana data nahin degaa
 In this, the government told the Supreme Court that it has formed a committee to protect the data
 23 janvari 2018 ko centre ne supreme court ko kaha he ki ritair justise bean shrikrishna kii adhyakshata main jo cameti banaai gai he wo bill march tak taiyaar ho jayega
 That is, India is far behind
 duniya kii sarkarein pehle se hi jag chuki hai
 During the presidential elections in the United States, Italy, France and Germany, there was discussion that Russia had the power to change their elections
 technolji or data ke zarie vah chunaav ko prabhavit kar rahaa he
 Lies and hatred are loudly propagated, which in turn results in change
 khaskar european union ko laga ki rus har chunaav main hastkshep kar europea union kii ekta ko prabhavit kar rahaa he
 The European Union is breaking up
 khaskar britain ke alag hone ko bhi data ke istamaal se joda ja rahaa he
 Think that elections are going on in India and from our data, America is deciding which party should get a majority so that after forming its government, it can formulate policies in the desired manner
 kya aap aisa chahenge
 28 countries of the European Union have enacted data protection laws to protect their elections
 aap jaanate hai ki america kii kai technolji company fasebuk google kaa mukhyalay ireland main he, kyonki ireland main baaki deshon kaa kanoon lagu nahin hota tha
 The European Union has changed this system through legislation
 ab in companiyon par european union ke banaae niyam lagu hone the
 Germany has also made its laws very strict
 kuch saal pehle belgium ne fasebuk ko privesi data kanoon ke ulanghan ke maamle main adaalat main ghaseet liya tha
 a committee has been formed in the Parliament of Britain on how social media is impacting elections, there is Information Commissioner's Office which investigates such cases
 bharat daawa to karata he ki uske kanoon sakht hai magar vah kaaphi peeche chal rahaa he
 If there is tension in a district, direct internet has to be stopped
 jin tatwon kii vajah se band karnaa padataa he unhen kabhi in sakht kanoonon ke dam par sazaa mili he yaa nahin, iskaa record bahut karaab hi hoga
 This was debated in the Supreme Court in September last year
 tab whats ap ne kaha tha ki vah yuzar kaa data kisi tisare ko nahin detaa he
 The government had asked 21 companies making smart phones that how secure the data is with you
 ritair justise bean shrikrishna kii adhyakshata main data protection par cameti banaai
 In the month of January, the government has told the Supreme Court that after its report, the data protection bill will be ready by March
 yani abhi ham taiyaar nahin he, taiyaari kar rahe hai
 Would you like Russia or America to take such data from you and run such an election campaign, in the guise of which we all come and we choose a government which will later cut our own pockets
 jeena mushkil kar de
 It is said that the election is being influenced by the data
 phir bhi bahut se log nahin samajhate hai ki chunaav ko kaise prabhavit kiya ja saktaa he
 We asked the same question to Rakesh, who runs an organization called Ballotbox India
 nai sanstha he, ham zyaada nahin jaanate
 Now come to the current controversy
 aap jaanate hai ki jab se trump jite hai america main jaanch ho rahi he ki kya is chunaav main rus ne dakhal diya tha, matlab kya rus ne apni taraf se koi propeganda chalaaya jiskaa laabh trump ko mila
 Suppose ten companies in India consider a leader as their Bunty, to win Bunty and later Bunty will work on our whistle
 banty jeet gaya, aapke saamne sher banegaa magar companiyon ke saamne chup rahegaa
 That is why research is going on all over the world that democracy cannot be eliminated with the use of data
 abhi yah samajha hi ja rahaa he ki kya galat he, kya sahi he
 But in India, Congress and BJP are blaming each other as if they have understood everything
 disambar 2016 main america kii dizine kii professor 'carole Cadwalladr' ne apane research ke dauraan paaya ki amareeki chunaav main cambrinz analita kii bhoomika he or uskaa sambandh european union se britain ko alag karne ke abhiyaan main bhi he
 Cambridge Analytica received data from more than 50 million US citizens from a researcher
 is research ne ek ap banaaya tha, jisase log apni sahmati se jude the
 As many apps come on Facebook, you click and start connecting and press the button of i Agri
 yaa to aap samaj nahin pate yaa laaparvaah ho jate hai, udhar vah ap aapaki sari jaankaree lekar kisi teesri party ko bech dete hai
 That company uses that data to change the air of politics or to sell a product
 yahi hua he is vivaad main
 Now for five days, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook admitted that a big mistake has been made
 aage se nahin ho iske liye vyavastha kii jaaegi
 People involved with data and privacy say that this is not enough
 zukarbarg yah bataayen ki 2014 se pehle jin jin ap ne data churaayaa he, uskaa ve kya kar rahe hai isaki jaanch sambhav nahin he, kyonki ap kii sankhya to kai hazaar main he
 We and you use Facebook
 ek bharosa hota he magar usee se jaankaree kisi or ke paas chali jaae to phir bharosa tuutata he
 And if that information was used by a company sitting in Russia or America to influence your political opinion, then it means that democracy can be in danger at any time due to technology
 aap dekhie ki kai jagahon par aisa ho rahaa he
 Once coming to power, it is not losing
 rus ke raashtrapati putin ko dekhie, china ke raashtrapati to aaajeevan hi gaddi par baith gaye hai
 No one in India should have such a dream, so the public should be alert about this subject
 yah masalaa fasebuk kaa he magar aapako sochna chahie ki kahin aadhaar number ke kaaran yah khatra kareeb to nahin he
 America, Italy, France and Germany do not have an Aadhaar number, India has an Aadhaar number
 kahin aisa na ho ki sabsidi bachaane ke naam par loktantr hi haath se chalaa jaae
 When the matter arose in Britain, the Election Commission immediately began to investigate, Congress BJP in India are making allegations, openly saying that you did it and you did it
 magar chunaav ayog kaa pataa nahin
 What address does not come under its jurisdiction
 bharat main jab bhi iviem ke hack kiye jane kaa sawaal uthta he to ham mazaaq udaate hai
 The biggest argument is how can one doubt the Election Commission
 hamen nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki isi chunaav ayog ke rahete dashakon booth luute jate rahe
 Not the Commission, but one person made the Commission trustworthy
 kya aapako yah lagata he ki america, france, italy, germany ke chunaav ayog main logon kaa vishwaas hi nahin hai
 Still there is a debate whether technology or the process of election is being affected
 germany main aam chunaav ke pehle vahaan khub charchaa hui
 The head of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution had said that it is absolutely possible to hack the election and influence it from outside
 ek report pard rahaa tha jisamen kaha gaya ki germany main ek counting software he jise pc-wahl he, ise hack kiya ja saktaa he
 The result can be changed by manipulating its data
 un deshon main aise sawaalon ko gambhirtha se liya jaataa he, hamaare yahaan aise saare sawaal kaa yahi jawaab he ki ham chunaav ayog par shaq kaise kar sakate hai
 Just ask what is the system to prevent such a possibility with the Election Commission
 balatbox india ke rakesh ne haal hi main ek lanbaa patr likhakar in khataron ke prati aagaah kiya tha magar vahi jawaab mila, balki ab to jawaab na milanaa hi jawaab samajha jane laga he
 The comments yah jatil masalaa he magar samajhnaa aasaan he
 What will happen is that you consent to give your information to an app, and use it for some other purpose
 jaisaa ki crambinge analitica ke maamle main hua
 The people themselves gave information to Research Cogan of Cambridge University
 usne zarur cambridge analitica ko bech diya
 Do not get into the game of Congress BJP so quickly
 mehnat se hasil loktantr kii chintaa kiijie
 Every party in India is now using data
 isiilie har chunaav main aap dekhenge ki jhooth kaa bolbalaa ho gaya he
 Every lie is greater than another lie
 bharat main cambridge enelitica company ke sutara ab jediu ke netaa kasee tyaagi ke bete amrish tyaagi se jud rahe hai
 Alexander Nix, founder of the Cambridge Analytica Company, built the Strategic Communication Laboratory in India
 nix do logo ke saath milakar dekh rahe the jinamein se ek hai avanish raay or duusare hai amrish tyaagi, kasee tyaagi ke ladke
 Avnish Rai spoke to Srinivasan Jain and explained how the Knicks were interested in India's election
 shuruyaat main nix ne kaha tha ki wo congress ke liye data collection kii baat karne aae hai magar baad main pachaa chalaa ki ve congress ko haraane ke liye kaam kar rahe the
 Avnish is also telling how the data was collected by creating an app and there was a dispute over who will be the host of that data
 avaneesh ab is maamle main visal blor ban gaye he
 Listen to their interview, your senses will fly away
 nix kaa kahana tha ki uskaa matlab sirf dhandha karne se he wo paisa kamaane se aayaa tha
 The text that has been said in English does not reflect in the translation, but still the Minister would have been better to give the statement 'are o Sambha Type', telling that India has ever made a case against Google and Facebook, theft
 Caught like the European Union in June 2017 against Google 2
 4 billian euro kaa jurmaana kiya tha, kyonki google galat tareekon se apana varchasv bana rahaa tha
 At the time of Net Neutrality, the Government of India had definitely brought Facebook on its way because at that time Facebook had started provoking people against the government by advertising in newspapers here
 is ghatana ko bhi ham bhul chuke hai
 People also raised this matter first, there was a lot of debate then the government came into it
 fasebuk, crambridge analitica se judi bahes bahut gambhir he
 This should be understood carefully
 bharat main kanoon to he, lekin kya use lekar hamaari aapaki samaj he
 Tomorrow, when someone goes to the election game with the help of Aadhaar number, then how will you and we understand that public opinion was reversed through these information
 ham kaise samajhenge ki jo hua wo galat tha, uske liye hameen zimmedaar the, hamane hi jaankaree de di thi or uske baad yah sabit kaise hoga
 Is the Election Commission ready for such situations
 bharat jaise desh main har chunaav main kisi na kisi kii sex tivi channelon par chalane lagati he, us desh main hamaare netaa privesi ke export banakar bhaashan de rahe hai
 Assuring the public that your data means your information is safe
 aap apane shahar ke kisi bhi sibar cell main chale jaaiye
 Look at his condition and then you will know what arrangements India has made
 puri duniya main bahes chal rahi he ki kahin baahar kaa desh, companiyon kaa giroh milakar hamaare aapke data se chunaav kaa nateeja hi na badal de
 The matter was debated in the Supreme Court in September last year
 us vakt sarkaar ne sitambar 2017 main smart phone banane vaali 21 companiyon se poocha tha ki aapke mobile phone main data kitna surakshit he
 Whats Up had told the Supreme Court that it would not give its data to any third party
 isi main sarkaar ne supreme court ko bataaya ki usne data kii suraksha ke liye ek cameti banaai he
 On 23 January 2018, the Center has told the Supreme Court that the committee constituted under the chairmanship of Retired Justice BN Srikrishna, the bill will be ready by March
 yani bharat abhi kaaphi peeche he
 The governments of the world have already awakened
 america main hue raashtrapati chunaav, italy, france or germany ke chunaavon ke dauraan hi vahaan charchaa chal padi ki rus unke chunaavon ko badalane kii takat rakhata he
 Through technology and data, he is influencing elections
 jhooth or nafrat kii baton kaa jor-shor se prachaar hota he, jiske prabhaav main nattejey badal jate hai
 Especially the European Union felt that Russia was affecting the unity of the European Union by interfering in every election
 european union ko tod rahaa he
 Particularly the separation of Britain is also being linked to the use of data
 sochie bharat main chunaav ho rahe hai or hamaare data se america tay kar rahaa ho ki koun se dal ko bahumat milanaa chahie taaki uski sarkaar banane ke baad wo manachaahe dhang se nitiyaan bana sake
 Would you like to european union ke 28 deshon ne apane yahaan hone vaale chunaavon ko bachaane ke liye data protection kanoon banaaya he
 You know that Facebook technology is headquartered in Ireland by many technology company of USA, because the law of other countries was not applicable in Ireland
 european union ne kanoon ke zarie is vyavastha ko badal diya he
 Now the rules made by the European Union were to apply to these companies
 germany ne bhi apane kanoon kaaphi sakht kiye hai
 a few years ago, Belgium dragged Facebook to court in violation of privacy data law
 britain kii sansad main ek cameti bani he ki soshal media kaa chunaavon par kya prabhaav pad rahaa he, vahaan information kamishnar offis he jo aise maamalon kii jaanch karata he
 India claims that its laws are strict but it is lagging far behind
 kisi zile main tanaav ho jaae to sidhaa internet band karnaa padataa he
 Elements that have to be shut down have ever been punished on the basis of these strict laws or not, its record will be very poor
 pichley saal sitambar main supreme court main is par bahes hui thi
 Whats up then said that it does not give user data to any third
 sarkaar ne smart phone banane vaali 21 companio se poocha tha ki aapke yahaan data kitna surakshit he
 Committee on Data Protection headed by Retired Justice BN Srikrishna
 abhi janvari maheene main sarkaar ne supreme court ko bataaya he ki isaki report ke baad march tak data protection kaa bill taiyaar ho jayega
 That is, we are not ready yet, we are preparing
 kya aap chahenge ki rus yaa america hamaara aapkaa data lekar aisa chunavi campan chalaa de jiske jhaanse main ham sab aa jaaen or ham aisi sarkaar chun len jo baad main hamaari hi jeb kaatane lage
 Make it difficult to live isi ko kehete hai ki data se chunaav prabhavit kiya ja rahaa he
 Yet many people do not understand how elections can be affected
 hamane yahi sawaal rakesh se poocha jo belatbox india naam kii sanstha chalaate hai
 We are a new institution, we do not know much
 ab aate hai maujuuda vivaad par
 You know that since Trump won, the United States has been investigating whether Russia interfered in this election, meaning that Russia ran a propaganda on its behalf that benefited Trump
 maan lijie bharat main das companiyaan kisi netaa ko apana banty samajhati hon, ki banty ko jeeta den or baad main banty hamaari siti par kaam karegaa
 Bunty wins, a lion will be there in front of you but will remain silent in front of companies
 isiilie duniya bhar main research chal rahaa he ki kahin data ke istamaal se loktantr hi na samaapt ho jaae
 It is being understood that what is wrong, what is right
 lekin bharat main congress or bijepi is tarah ek duusare par aarope laga rahi hai jaise in donon ne sabakuch samaj liya ho
 In December 2016, Carole Cadwalladr, a US design professor, during her research found Cambrian Analita's role in the US election and her connection to the campaign to separate Britain from the European Union
 cambridge analitica ko 5 karod se adhik amareeki nagarikon kaa data ek research se mila
 This researcher had created an app, which people associated with their consent
 jaise fasebuk par bahut se ap aate hai, aap clic kar judane lag jate hai or ai agri kaa batan dabaa dete hai
 Either you do not understand or become careless, on the other hand, the app takes all your information and sells it to a third party
 vah company us data kaa istemaal raajnneetik kii hawa badalane main karti he yaa kisi product ko bechney main karti he
 This is what happened in this dispute
 ab paanch dinon tak fasebuk ke mark zukarbarg ne mana ki bahut badi galati ho gai he
 Arrangements will be made for this to not happen from now on
 data or privesi se jude log kehete hai ki yah kaaphi nahin he
 It should not be possible to tell Zuckerberg that what the app that stole data before 2014 is doing what they are doing, because the number of apps is in thousands
 ham or aap fasebuk kaa istemaal karte hai
 There is a trust, but if the information gets passed on to someone else, then the trust is broken
 or us jaankaree kaa istemaal aapke raajnneetik mat ko prabhavit karne main rus yaa america main baithi koi company kar le to sidhaa matlab yah hua ki loktantr technolji ke kaaran kabhi bhi khatre main pad saktaa he
 You see that this is happening in many places
 ek baar jo satta main aa rahaa he, wo haar hi nahin rahaa he
 Look at the President of Russia, Putin, the President of China has sat on the throne for a lifetime
 bharat main koi is tarah kaa sapana na dekhe isliye janata ko is vishay ko lekar satark ho janaa chahie
 This is the issue of Facebook, but you should think that due to Aadhaar number, this danger is not close
 america, italy, france or germany main aadhaar number nahin he, bharat main aadhaar number he
 Lest democracy should run out in the name of saving subsidies
 britain main maamla uthaa to vahaan kaa chunaav ayog turant jaanch karne laga, bharat main congress bijepi aarope laga rahe hai, khuleam kah rahe hai ki aapane aisa kiya to aapane aisa kiya
 But the Election Commission does not know
 kya pataa uske adhikaar kshetra main hi yah na aata ho
 Whenever the question of evms is hacked in India, we make fun
 sabase badi daleel he ki chunaav ayog par shaq kaise kar sakate hai
 We should not forget that during this election commission booths were looted for decades
 ayog ne nahin, ek vyakti ne ayog ko bharose laayak banaaya tha
 Do you think that people do not have faith in the Election Commission of America, France, Italy, Germany
 phir bhi vahaan bahes ho rahi he ki technalji se kahin riselt yaa chunaav kii prakriya ko prabhavit to nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 There was a lot of discussion before the general election in Germany
 vahaan ke fedral offis for di protection of di constitution ke pramukh ne kaha tha ki chunaav ko hack karnaa, baahar se prabhavit karnaa bilkul sambhav he
 Was reading a report that said there is a counting software in Germany which is pc-wahl, it can be hacked
 iske data ko ched kar riselt badla ja saktaa he
 Such questions are taken seriously in those countries, this is the answer to all such questions here, how can we doubt the Election Commission
 yahi puch lijie ki chunaav ayog ke paas aisi sambhaavna ko rokane ke liye system hi kya he
 Rakesh of Balletbox India had recently written a long letter and warned against these dangers, but got the same answer, but now the answer is beginning to be understood
 tippaniyan This is a complex issue but easy to understand
 kya hoga ki aap sahmati se apni jaankaree kisi ap ko de den, or vah uskaa istamaal kisi or kaam ke liye kar le
 As in the case of Crambin Analytica
 logon ne khud hi cambridge uniwarsity ke researchan kogan ko jaankaree di
 He definitely sold it to Cambridge Analytica
 itani jaldi se congress bijepi ke khel main mat padie
 Worry about hard-earned democracy
 bharat main har dal ab data kaa istemaal kar rahaa he
 That is why in every election you will see that lies have been dominated
 har jhooth duusare jhooth se bada hota he
 Sources at Cambridge Analytica Company in India are now joining Amrish Tyagi, son of JDU leader Casey Tyagi
 cambridge enelitica company ke sansthaapak alexander nix ne bharat main stritgic communication leboratory banaai
 Nix was seen together with two people, one of whom is Avnish Rai and the other is Amrish Tyagi, KC Tyagi's boys
 avanish raay ne shrinivasana jain se baat kii or vistaar se bataaya ki kaise nix kii ruchi bharat ke chunaav main thi
 Initially, Nix had said that he had come to talk of data collection for Congress but later came to know that he was working to defeat Congress
 avanish yah bhi bataa rahe hai ki ap bana kar kaise data ikaitha kiya or us data kaa host koun hoga is par vivaad hua
 Avnish has now become a whistle blower in this case
 aap inkaa intervyuu suniye, hosh ud jaaenge
 Nix said that he meant only by doing business, he came from earning money

 or us jaankaree kaa istemaal aapke raajnneetik mat ko prabhavit karne main rus yaa america main baithi koi company kar le to sidhaa matlab yah hua ki loktantr technolji ke kaaran kabhi bhi khatre main pad saktaa he
 You see that this is happening in many places
 ek baar jo satta main aa rahaa he, wo haar hi nahin rahaa he
 Look at the President of Russia, Putin, the President of China has sat on the throne for a lifetime
 bharat main koi is tarah kaa sapana na dekhe isliye janata ko is vishay ko lekar satark ho janaa chahie
 This is the issue of Facebook, but you should think that due to Aadhaar number, this danger is not close
 america, italy, france or germany main aadhaar number nahin he, bharat main aadhaar number he
 Lest democracy should run out in the name of saving subsidies
 britain main maamla uthaa to vahaan kaa chunaav ayog turant jaanch karne laga, bharat main congress bijepi aarope laga rahe hai, khuleam kah rahe hai ki aapane aisa kiya to aapane aisa kiya
 But the Election Commission does not know
 kya pataa uske adhikaar kshetra main hi yah na aata ho
 Whenever the question of evms is hacked in India, we make fun
 sabase badi daleel he ki chunaav ayog par shaq kaise kar sakate hai
 We should not forget that during this election commission booths were looted for decades
 ayog ne nahin, ek vyakti ne ayog ko bharose laayak banaaya tha
 Do you think that people do not have faith in the Election Commission of America, France, Italy, Germany
 phir bhi vahaan bahes ho rahi he ki technalji se kahin riselt yaa chunaav kii prakriya ko prabhavit to nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 There was a lot of discussion before the general election in Germany
 vahaan ke fedral offis for di protection of di constitution ke pramukh ne kaha tha ki chunaav ko hack karnaa, baahar se prabhavit karnaa bilkul sambhav he
 Was reading a report that said there is a counting software in Germany which is pc-wahl, it can be hacked
 iske data ko ched kar riselt badla ja saktaa he
 Such questions are taken seriously in those countries, this is the answer to all such questions here, how can we doubt the Election Commission
 yahi puch lijie ki chunaav ayog ke paas aisi sambhaavna ko rokane ke liye system hi kya he
 Rakesh of Balletbox India had recently written a long letter and warned against these dangers, but got the same answer, but now the answer is beginning to be understood
 tippaniyan This is a complex issue but easy to understand
 kya hoga ki aap sahmati se apni jaankaree kisi ap ko de den, or vah uskaa istamaal kisi or kaam ke liye kar le
 As in the case of Crambin Analytica
 logon ne khud hi cambridge uniwarsity ke researchan kogan ko jaankaree di
 He definitely sold it to Cambridge Analytica
 itani jaldi se congress bijepi ke khel main mat padie
 Worry about hard-earned democracy
 bharat main har dal ab data kaa istemaal kar rahaa he
 That is why in every election you will see that lies have been dominated
 har jhooth duusare jhooth se bada hota he
 Sources at Cambridge Analytica Company in India are now joining Amrish Tyagi, son of JDU leader Casey Tyagi
 cambridge enelitica company ke sansthaapak alexander nix ne bharat main stritgic communication leboratory banaai
 Nix was seen together with two people, one of whom is Avnish Rai and the other is Amrish Tyagi, KC Tyagi's boys
 avanish raay ne shrinivasana jain se baat kii or vistaar se bataaya ki kaise nix kii ruchi bharat ke chunaav main thi
 Initially, Nix had said that he had come to talk of data collection for Congress but later came to know that he was working to defeat Congress
 avanish yah bhi bataa rahe hai ki ap bana kar kaise data ikaitha kiya or us data kaa host koun hoga is par vivaad hua
 Avnish has now become a whistle blower in this case
 aap inkaa intervyuu suniye, hosh ud jaaenge
 Nix said that he meant only by doing business, he came from earning money
 european union ne kanoon ke zarie is vyavastha ko badal diya he
 Now the rules made by the European Union were to apply to these companies
 germany ne bhi apane kanoon kaaphi sakht kiye hai
 a few years ago, Belgium dragged Facebook to court in violation of privacy data law
 britain kii sansad main ek cameti bani he ki soshal media kaa chunaavon par kya prabhaav pad rahaa he, vahaan information kamishnar offis he jo aise maamalon kii jaanch karata he
 India claims that its laws are strict but it is lagging far behind
 kisi zile main tanaav ho jaae to sidhaa internet band karnaa padataa he
 Elements that have to be shut down have ever been punished on the basis of these strict laws or not, its record will be very poor
 pichley saal sitambar main supreme court main is par bahes hui thi
 Whats up then said that it does not give user data to any third
 sarkaar ne smart phone banane vaali 21 companio se poocha tha ki aapke yahaan data kitna surakshit he
 Committee on Data Protection headed by Retired Justice BN Srikrishna
 abhi janvari maheene main sarkaar ne supreme court ko bataaya he ki isaki report ke baad march tak data protection kaa bill taiyaar ho jayega
 That is, we are not ready yet, we are preparing
 kya aap chahenge ki rus yaa america hamaara aapkaa data lekar aisa chunavi campan chalaa de jiske jhaanse main ham sab aa jaaen or ham aisi sarkaar chun len jo baad main hamaari hi jeb kaatane lage
 Make it difficult to live isi ko kehete hai ki data se chunaav prabhavit kiya ja rahaa he
 Yet many people do not understand how elections can be affected
 hamane yahi sawaal rakesh se poocha jo belatbox india naam kii sanstha chalaate hai
 We are a new institution, we do not know much
 ab aate hai maujuuda vivaad par
 You know that since Trump won, the United States has been investigating whether Russia interfered in this election, meaning that Russia ran a propaganda on its behalf that benefited Trump
 maan lijie bharat main das companiyaan kisi netaa ko apana banty samajhati hon, ki banty ko jeeta den or baad main banty hamaari siti par kaam karegaa
 Bunty wins, a lion will be there in front of you but will remain silent in front of companies
 isiilie duniya bhar main research chal rahaa he ki kahin data ke istamaal se loktantr hi na samaapt ho jaae
 It is being understood that what is wrong, what is right
 lekin bharat main congress or bijepi is tarah ek duusare par aarope laga rahi hai jaise in donon ne sabakuch samaj liya ho
 In December 2016, Carole Cadwalladr, a US design professor, during her research found Cambrian Analita's role in the US election and her connection to the campaign to separate Britain from the European Union
 cambridge analitica ko 5 karod se adhik amareeki nagarikon kaa data ek research se mila
 This researcher had created an app, which people associated with their consent
 jaise fasebuk par bahut se ap aate hai, aap clic kar judane lag jate hai or ai agri kaa batan dabaa dete hai
 Either you do not understand or become careless, on the other hand, the app takes all your information and sells it to a third party
 vah company us data kaa istemaal raajnneetik kii hawa badalane main karti he yaa kisi product ko bechney main karti he
 This is what happened in this dispute
 ab paanch dinon tak fasebuk ke mark zukarbarg ne mana ki bahut badi galati ho gai he
 Arrangements will be made for this to not happen from now on
 data or privesi se jude log kehete hai ki yah kaaphi nahin he
 It should not be possible to tell Zuckerberg that what the app that stole data before 2014 is doing what they are doing, because the number of apps is in thousands
 ham or aap fasebuk kaa istemaal karte hai
 There is a trust, but if the information gets passed on to someone else, then the trust is broken
 or us jaankaree kaa istemaal aapke raajnneetik mat ko prabhavit karne main rus yaa america main baithi koi company kar le to sidhaa matlab yah hua ki loktantr technolji ke kaaran kabhi bhi khatre main pad saktaa he

 If there is tension in a district, direct internet has to be stopped
 jin tatwon kii vajah se band karnaa padataa he unhen kabhi in sakht kanoonon ke dam par sazaa mili he yaa nahin, iskaa record bahut karaab hi hoga
 This was debated in the Supreme Court in September last year
 tab whats ap ne kaha tha ki vah yuzar kaa data kisi tisare ko nahin detaa he
 The government had asked 21 companies making smart phones that how secure the data is with you
 ritair justise bean shrikrishna kii adhyakshata main data protection par cameti banaai
 In the month of January, the government has told the Supreme Court that after its report, the data protection bill will be ready by March
 yani abhi ham taiyaar nahin he, taiyaari kar rahe hai
 Would you like Russia or America to take such data from you and run such an election campaign, in the guise of which we all come and we choose a government which will later cut our own pockets
 jeena mushkil kar de
 It is said that the election is being influenced by the data
 phir bhi bahut se log nahin samajhate hai ki chunaav ko kaise prabhavit kiya ja saktaa he
 We asked the same question to Rakesh, who runs an organization called Ballotbox India
 nai sanstha he, ham zyaada nahin jaanate
 Now come to the current controversy
 aap jaanate hai ki jab se trump jite hai america main jaanch ho rahi he ki kya is chunaav main rus ne dakhal diya tha, matlab kya rus ne apni taraf se koi propeganda chalaaya jiskaa laabh trump ko mila
 Suppose ten companies in India consider a leader as their Bunty, to win Bunty and later Bunty will work on our whistle
 banty jeet gaya, aapke saamne sher banegaa magar companiyon ke saamne chup rahegaa
 That is why research is going on all over the world that democracy cannot be eliminated with the use of data
 abhi yah samajha hi ja rahaa he ki kya galat he, kya sahi he
 But in India, Congress and BJP are blaming each other as if they have understood everything
 disambar 2016 main america kii dizine kii professor 'carole Cadwalladr' ne apane research ke dauraan paaya ki amareeki chunaav main cambrinz analita kii bhoomika he or uskaa sambandh european union se britain ko alag karne ke abhiyaan main bhi he
 Cambridge Analytica received data from more than 50 million US citizens from a researcher
 is research ne ek ap banaaya tha, jisase log apni sahmati se jude the
 As many apps come on Facebook, you click and start connecting and press the button of i Agri
 yaa to aap samaj nahin pate yaa laaparvaah ho jate hai, udhar vah ap aapaki sari jaankaree lekar kisi teesri party ko bech dete hai
 That company uses that data to change the air of politics or to sell a product
 yahi hua he is vivaad main
 Now for five days, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook admitted that a big mistake has been made
 aage se nahin ho iske liye vyavastha kii jaaegi
 People involved with data and privacy say that this is not enough
 zukarbarg yah bataayen ki 2014 se pehle jin jin ap ne data churaayaa he, uskaa ve kya kar rahe hai isaki jaanch sambhav nahin he, kyonki ap kii sankhya to kai hazaar main he
 We and you use Facebook
 ek bharosa hota he magar usee se jaankaree kisi or ke paas chali jaae to phir bharosa tuutata he
 And if that information was used by a company sitting in Russia or America to influence your political opinion, then it means that democracy can be in danger at any time due to technology
 aap dekhie ki kai jagahon par aisa ho rahaa he
 Once coming to power, it is not losing
 rus ke raashtrapati putin ko dekhie, china ke raashtrapati to aaajeevan hi gaddi par baith gaye hai
 No one in India should have such a dream, so the public should be alert about this subject
 yah masalaa fasebuk kaa he magar aapako sochna chahie ki kahin aadhaar number ke kaaran yah khatra kareeb to nahin he
 America, Italy, France and Germany do not have an Aadhaar number, India has an Aadhaar number
 kahin aisa na ho ki sabsidi bachaane ke naam par loktantr hi haath se chalaa jaae
 When the matter arose in Britain, the Election Commission immediately began to investigate, Congress BJP in India are making allegations, openly saying that you did it and you did it
 magar chunaav ayog kaa pataa nahin
 What address does not come under its jurisdiction
 bharat main jab bhi iviem ke hack kiye jane kaa sawaal uthta he to ham mazaaq udaate hai
 The biggest argument is how can one doubt the Election Commission
 hamen nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki isi chunaav ayog ke rahete dashakon booth luute jate rahe
 Not the Commission, but one person made the Commission trustworthy
 kya aapako yah lagata he ki america, france, italy, germany ke chunaav ayog main logon kaa vishwaas hi nahin hai
 Still there is a debate whether technology or the process of election is being affected
 germany main aam chunaav ke pehle vahaan khub charchaa hui
 The head of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution had said that it is absolutely possible to hack the election and influence it from outside
 ek report pard rahaa tha jisamen kaha gaya ki germany main ek counting software he jise pc-wahl he, ise hack kiya ja saktaa he
 The result can be changed by manipulating its data
 un deshon main aise sawaalon ko gambhirtha se liya jaataa he, hamaare yahaan aise saare sawaal kaa yahi jawaab he ki ham chunaav ayog par shaq kaise kar sakate hai
 Just ask what is the system to prevent such a possibility with the Election Commission
 balatbox india ke rakesh ne haal hi main ek lanbaa patr likhakar in khataron ke prati aagaah kiya tha magar vahi jawaab mila, balki ab to jawaab na milanaa hi jawaab samajha jane laga he
 The comments yah jatil masalaa he magar samajhnaa aasaan he
 What will happen is that you consent to give your information to an app, and use it for some other purpose
 jaisaa ki crambinge analitica ke maamle main hua
 The people themselves gave information to Research Cogan of Cambridge University
 usne zarur cambridge analitica ko bech diya
 Do not get into the game of Congress BJP so quickly

 Avnish is also telling how the data was collected by creating an app and there was a dispute over who will be the host of that data

 What will happen is that you consent to give your information to an app, and use it for some other purpose

 Avnish Rai spoke to Srinivasan Jain and explained how the Knicks were interested in India's election
 shuruyaat main nix ne kaha tha ki wo congress ke liye data collection kii baat karne aae hai magar baad main pachaa chalaa ki ve congress ko haraane ke liye kaam kar rahe the
 Avnish is also telling how the data was collected by creating an app and there was a dispute over who will be the host of that data
 avaneesh ab is maamle main visal blor ban gaye he
 Listen to their interview, your senses will fly away
 nix kaa kahana tha ki uskaa matlab sirf dhandha karne se he wo paisa kamaane se aayaa tha
 In December 2016, Carole Cadwalladr, a US design professor, during her research found Cambrian Analita's role in the US election and her connection to the campaign to separate Britain from the European Union
 cambridge analitica ko 5 karod se adhik amareeki nagarikon kaa data ek research se mila
 This researcher had created an app, which people associated with their consent
 jaise fasebuk par bahut se ap aate hai, aap clic kar judane lag jate hai or ai agri kaa batan dabaa dete hai
 Either you do not understand or become careless, on the other hand, the app takes all your information and sells it to a third party
 vah company us data kaa istemaal raajnneetik kii hawa badalane main karti he yaa kisi product ko bechney main karti he
 This is what happened in this dispute
 ab paanch dinon tak fasebuk ke mark zukarbarg ne mana ki bahut badi galati ho gai he
 Arrangements will be made for this to not happen from now on
 data or privesi se jude log kehete hai ki yah kaaphi nahin he
 It should not be possible to tell Zuckerberg that what the app that stole data before 2014 is doing what they are doing, because the number of apps is in thousands
 ham or aap fasebuk kaa istemaal karte hai
 There is a trust, but if the information gets passed on to someone else, then the trust is broken
 or us jaankaree kaa istemaal aapke raajnneetik mat ko prabhavit karne main rus yaa america main baithi koi company kar le to sidhaa matlab yah hua ki loktantr technolji ke kaaran kabhi bhi khatre main pad saktaa he
 You see that this is happening in many places

 bharat main koi is tarah kaa sapana na dekhe isliye janata ko is vishay ko lekar satark ho janaa chahie
 This is the issue of Facebook, but you should think that due to Aadhaar number, this danger is not close

 But the Election Commission does not know

 Whenever the question of evms is hacked in India, we make fun

 Was reading a report that said there is a counting software in Germany which is pc-wahl, it can be hacked

 Such questions are taken seriously in those countries, this is the answer to all such questions here, how can we doubt the Election Commission
 yahi puch lijie ki chunaav ayog ke paas aisi sambhaavna ko rokane ke liye system hi kya he
 Rakesh of Balletbox India had recently written a long letter and warned against these dangers, but got the same answer, but now the answer is beginning to be understood
 tippaniyan This is a complex issue but easy to understand
 kya hoga ki aap sahmati se apni jaankaree kisi ap ko de den, or vah uskaa istamaal kisi or kaam ke liye kar le

 The biggest argument is how can one doubt the Election Commission
 hamen nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki isi chunaav ayog ke rahete dashakon booth luute jate rahe
 Not the Commission, but one person made the Commission trustworthy
 kya aapako yah lagata he ki america, france, italy, germany ke chunaav ayog main logon kaa vishwaas hi nahin hai
 Still there is a debate whether technology or the process of election is being affected
 germany main aam chunaav ke pehle vahaan khub charchaa hui
 The head of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution had said that it is absolutely possible to hack the election and influence it from outside
 ek report pard rahaa tha jisamen kaha gaya ki germany main ek counting software he jise pc-wahl he, ise hack kiya ja saktaa he
 The result can be changed by manipulating its data
 un deshon main aise sawaalon ko gambhirtha se liya jaataa he, hamaare yahaan aise saare sawaal kaa yahi jawaab he ki ham chunaav ayog par shaq kaise kar sakate hai
 Just ask what is the system to prevent such a possibility with the Election Commission

 vah 2016 november kaa doosraa saptaah tha
 The demonetisation had passed only ten days and almost 40 per cent of the big notes held by the public had reached the banks
 bachi hui nakadi petrol panpon, skulon, aspataalon main pahunch rahi thi jahaan use sweekaar karne kii ijaajat thi
 At the same time, the Reserve Bank stopped to explain how deposits in bank accounts were increasing and with this it was decided that most of the cash was probably being returned to banks
 band kiye gaye 99 fisadi noton kii bainkon main vaapasi kaa sanket to pichley saal june main hi mil gaya tha
 Now these erudite explanations have no meaning that income tax returns or tax payers have increased after demonetisation
 kya notebandi jaise viraat or maarak jokhim kaa makasad iskar ritern bharne kii aadat thik karnaa tha?or bazaar main nakadi to is kadar bad chuki he ki cashles yaa lescash arthvyavastha kii bahes hi ab besabab ho gai
 Actually, the big mysteries of demonetisation are still posh
 rigerv bank va sarkaar agar desh ko kuch sawaalon ke jawaab denge to hamen pataa chal sakegaa ki bharat ke aarthik itihaas kii sabase badi uthal puthal ke dauraan kya hua tha or shaayad isi main hamen kaale dhan ke kuch sutara mil jaaen, jin ke liye yah itnaa jaan-malaleva jokhim uthaaya gaya tha
 Who were the "poor" who opened millions of Jan Dhan accounts and deposited crores of rupees in old and new accounts during demonetisation? 23 just after demonetisation
 30 karod nae jan dhan khate khole gaye
 Of these, 80 percent opened in public sector banks
 notebandi ke vakt (9 november 2016) ko in khaaton main kul 456 arab rupye jamaa the jo 7 disambar 2016 ko 746 arab rupye par pahunch gaye
 Amid reports of misuse of Jan Dhan accounts, the government had on November 15, 2016 set an upper limit of Rs 50,000 for depositing funds in Jan Dhan accounts
 vitt mantri ne pichley saal farvari main sansad ko bataaya tha ki vibhinn khataadharakon (jandhan sahit) ko iskar vibhaag ne 5,100 notice bheje hai, iske baad notebandi main jandhan ke istemaal kii jaanch kahin gum ho gai!kya hamen kabhi yah pataa chal paaegaa ki notebandi ke dinon main sarkari (centre or rajya) khajaanon or bainkon main sarkari / piesu khaaton ke jariye kitni rakam kaa lenden hua? sanad rahe ki sarkari vibhaagon or sevaayen notebandi yaa nakad lenden kii taatkaalik seemaa se mukt the
 Many government services were allowed to take payments in restricted notes
 sarkari sevaaon ke vibhaagon ke network jariye kitni puraani nakadi badali gai, kya iskaa aankada desh ko nahin milanaa chahie?notebandi ke dauraan badi companiyon va kaarobaariyon ke chaalu khaaton or nakad lendhene ke jariye bainkon main kitne puraane note pahunche, isaki hamen koi jaankaree nahin he
 Subsequent investigations found several shell companies involved in money laundering
 aise main yah ummid karnaa jaij he ki sarkaar ke paas kaarobaari nakad khaaton ke istemaal ke bare main kaaphi jaankaree hogi
 During the demonetisation, the investigation of the movement of cash in big companies should be known to those who were barking in the lines of demonetisation to change their few hundred rupees
 kya desh ko yah jaanane kaa haq nahin he ki notebandi ke dauraan rajnatik partiyon ke khaaton main kitne lenden hue or us vakt jab logon ke paas aspataalon main dawa kharidne ke liye nakadi nahin thi, tab siyaasi dhooma-dhadaakon par kahaan or kaise kharch kiya gaya?sanad rahe ki aam log jab notebandi kii agnipariksha de rahe the tab sarkaar ne siyaasi partiyon ko apane khaaton main 500 rupye or 1,000 rupye ke puraane note jamaa karne kii ijaajat di thi, jise har tarah kaa jaanch se baahar rakhaa gaya tha
 It is also important for the country to know where the investigation of corruption in the banks during the demonetisation has stopped
 rigerv bank ne apni baat kah di he
 Now the government will have to shake its eyes with questions
 aisa kahaan likhaa he ki sarkarein galat nahin ho saktin
 In every country of the world, governments make various mistakes but they also accept them
 bharat ke karodon aam logon ne notebandi main tapakar apni eemaandaaree sabit kii he
 It is now the government's turn to undergo the ordeal
 *** The BJP has made another dent in Amethi, the stronghold of Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi
 amethi rajgaraane kii jang kaa phayda uthaate hue bijepi ne congress ke rajyasabha saansad sanjay singh ke bete anant vikram singh ko party main shaamil kar liya he
 Anant Vikram said, "by joining my BJP, the party will be strengthened in Amethi
" mauka mila to chunaav laduunga
 It is believed that the estate of the Amethi royalty is worth several crores, which is spread in many states of the country
 is jaagir ke liye sanjay singh, unki do patniyaan amita singh, garima singh or bete anant vikram singh ke bich jabardast jang chal rahi he
 In the past, there was a bloody struggle between them in front of the palace in which one person was killed and dozens of people were injured
 rajkumaar anant vikram raja kii pehali patni garima singh ke bete hai
 For the last 21 years, Garima Singh remained separated due to a dispute with Sanjay Singh
 anant vikram singh marchent navy main naukari karte the
 Now he has left his job and returned to the Amethi palace with his mother
 raja ne pehali patni or rajkumaar ko hathonhaath liya
 Rajkumar started putting up the court, so that the public directly connected with him
 sanjay singh kii duusari patni amita singh amethi vidhansabha seat se chunaav ladati hai
 It is believed that BJP wants to field him against his step mother
 amethi main is baar modi lahar main rahul gandhi kii jeet kaa margin kaaphi kaam ho gaya he
 The BJP has found a prince of the Congress royalty to surround him in Rahul's stronghold
 uttar pradesh ke lakhimpur khiri main jangal main ghaas kaatane gai ek 12 saal kii bacchee par achaanak baagh ne hamalaa kar diya

 Dr
 martin luther king junior ne 1959 main bharat pahunchane par tippanee kii- "anya deshon main main ek paryatak ke rup main ja saktaa hum, lekin bharat main main ek tirthayatri ke rup main aata hum
 He also stated that "above all, India is perhaps the land where non-violent social change techniques were developed and used by my people in Montgomery, Alabama and elsewhere in South America
" hamane unhen asardaar or tikaoo paaya - ve kaam karte hai!"dow king ko jo disha dikhaane vaali raushnee prerana dekar bharat laai, uskaa naam tha- mohandas karamchand gandhi, mahatma, mahaan aatma
 On Wednesday, we are celebrating his 150th birth anniversary
 gandhi ji, yaa baapu, kii ore se duniya bhar main lakhon logon ko himmat dena jari he
 Gandhian methods of resistance ignited hopes in many African countries
 dow
 King had said- "when i was visiting Ghana, West Africa, Prime Minister Krumah told me that he had read Gandhi's gratitude and felt that non-violent resistance could be tried there too
" hamen yaad kar sakate hai ki dakshin africa main bason kaa bahishkaar bhi hua
 "nelson Mandela referred to Gandhi as a" holy warrior "and wrote," His strategy of non-cooperation, and insisting that those who try to dominate us can dominate only when we cooperate with him 
 unki ahimsak pratirodh ne hamaari sadi main antarrashtriya str par upniveshwaad virdohi or naslwad virdohi andolanon ko prerit kiya
 For Mr
 Mandela, Gandhi was Indian and South African
 gandhi ne iskaa anumodan kiya hota
 He had a unique specialty and that was to be the bridge between the biggest contradictions of human society
 gandhi ne 1925 main “yang india” main likhaa: “rashtravaadi hue bina kisi kaa antarrashtriyavaadee hona naammumkin he
 Internationalism is possible only when nationalism emerges as a fact, ie when people from different countries have organized themselves and are able to function as an individual
 ” unhone bhartiya rashtrawaad kii kalpana kii, jo kabhi sankeern yaa vishisht nahin tha, balki wo maanavtaa kii seva ke liye kaam karne vaala tha
 Mahatma Gandhi also replaced trust among all sections of society
 1917 main, gujarat ke ahmedabad main badi taxtile hadtaal hui
 When the conflict between the mill workers and the owners increased so much that there was no sign of agreement, Gandhiji mediated and made an agreement acceptable to both sides
 gandhi ne shramikon ke adhikaron ke liye ‘majur mahajan sangh’ sanghathan banaaya
 At first glance, it may sound just like any other organization, but it shows how small steps can have a big impact
 un dinon "mahajan" naam kuleen varg ke logon ke liye aadar suchak istemaal hota tha
 Gandhi reversed the social structure by adding the name "mahajan" to "majur" or laborers
 us shabdic vikalp ke saath, gandhi ne shramikon ke garv ko badhaayaaor gandhi ne saamaanya vastuon ko jan-raajnneeti ke saath joda
 Who else could have used the spinning wheel and the woven cloth at home as a symbol of a nation's economic self-reliance and empowerment? And who could have created a mass movement with a pinch of salt! During the colonial rule, the 'salt laws' that imposed a new tax on India's salt had become a burden
 1930 main dandi march ke jariye gandhi ne namak kanoonon ko chunauti di
 The historic civil disobedience movement was encouraged by the lifting of small pieces of natural salt from the Arabian Sea coast
 duniya main kai jan andolan hue hai, bharat main bhi swatantraaa sangram se jude kai hisse hai, lekin gandhivadi sangharsh ko jo sabase alag karata he wo unase prerana lekar logon kii bade paimaane par bhagidaari
 He never held any administrative or elected office
 unhen satta kabhi nahin lubhaa saki
 For him, independence was not the absence of external rule
 unhone raajnneetik swatantraaa or vyaktigat shashaktikaran ke bich gaharaa naata dekha
 He envisioned a world where every citizen has dignity and prosperity
 jab duniya ne adhikaron ke bare main baat kii, to gandhi ne dayitvon par jor diya
 He wrote in "young India": "the true source of rights is obligations
 agar ham sabhi apane dayitvon kaa nirvahan karte hai, to adhikaron kaa milanaa bhi dur nahin hoga
 "he wrote in a magazine called 'harijan'," He gets the rights automatically, who faithfully fulfills his obligations
 ”gandhi ne hamen trustiship kaa siddhant diya jo garibon ke saamaajik-aarthik kalyaan par jor detaa he
 Inspired by that, we should think about our sense of ownership
 ham, prithvi ke vaaris ke taur par isaki behatari ke liye jimmedaar hai, jisamen wo vanaspati or jeev bhi shaamil hai jinke saath ham grih ko saajha karte hai
 We have the best teachers as Gandhi for our guidance
 tikaoo vikaas ko aade majboot karne ke liye maanavtaa main vishwaas rakhane waalon ko ekajute karne se lekar aarthik aatmanirbharta sunishchit karne ke liye, gandhi har samasya kaa samaadhaan dete hai
 We are doing our work in India
 agar garibi unmoolan kii baat kii jaae to bharat sabase teji se kaam karne waalon main shaamil he
 Our cleanliness efforts have attracted worldwide attention
 bharat antarrashtriya saura gathbandhan jaise prayaason ke jariye akshay sansadhano kaa istemaal karne main bhi aage he, ye gathbandhan sthaayee bhavishya kii khatir saura urja kaa laabh uthaane ke liye kai deshon ko saath laayaa he
 We want to do more with the world and for the world
 gandhi ko shradhanjali ke rup main jise main oinstin chalange kahata hum, uskaa prastaav karata hum
 We know Albert Einstein's famous words on Gandhi: "the generations to come will hardly believe that such a person with Hadams and blood used to walk on this earth
 "ham yah kaise sunishchit karen ki gandhi ke aadarshon ko aane vaali peediyaan yaad rakhen? main vichaarkon, udhyamiyon or takanic leaders ko abhinav tareekon se gandhi ke vichaaron ko failaane ke liye agrim morche par aane ko aamantrit karata humie ham apni duniya ko samrudh banane ke liye, nafrat, hinsa or pidaa se mukt banane ke liye, kandhe se kandhaa milakar kaam karen

 He said that nothing has been done for the welfare of the tribals of those areas during the last 63 years

 This is the reason why poor tribals lost faith in the system and they have been attracted towards Maoism
 unhen yah mahasoos karana hog ki loktantr sabase acchhee vyavastha he jiske tahat ve fal phool sakate hai
 He said that the mineral wealth should be nationalized and honest and clean image bureaucrats should be deployed in tribal dominated areas where activities related to mining operations are going on

 Meanwhile, state government spokesperson and Food Supply Minister Dinesh Gundu Rao expressed displeasure that Anupama's behavior was not an official one
 agar unhen shikaayat thi to grih mantri se lekar dijipi or duusare varisht adhikariyon se unhen baat kerani chahie thi joki unhone nahin kiya, balki istipha dene ke baad wo mobile of kar is tarah gaayab hui hai ki unke varisht adhikari bhi sampark nahin kar paa rahe
 For the first time on Wednesday, Karnataka's Labor Minister Parameshwara Nayak appeared in front of the media and clarified that he had nothing to do with Anupama's resignation nor was he responsible for it
 aisa kaha ja rahaa he ki bellari ke gramin ilaake ke ek bas stand par ban rahe ek avaidh pub ko rokane kaa aadesh unhone diya lekin isapar karrwai shram mantri parameshwar ke dabaav kii vajah se nahin hui
 And so he resigned
 darasal anupama ne 4 june ko istipha diya tha or iske baad unase judi jaankaree sirf fasebuk ke zariye aa rahi he
 The latest update has said that Anupama can withdraw her resignation if Labor Minister Parameshwara Nayak resigns
 phir aage ye bhi post aayaa ki ek sidi jari kii jaaegi jo parameshwar nayak ko benaqaab karegi
 Now it is also being said about this Facebook post that someone has hacked Anupama's account and is posting the same

 About six months ago, the dispute between Anupama and the Labor Minister came to light when the Labor Minister said during the speech that he was the one who transferred Anupama because Anupama had put her phone on hold
 sarkaar agar unka istipha manzur karti he to bhi notification ke baad 60 dinon ke andar praavdhaanon ke mutabik wo apana istipha waapas le sakati hai

 It is said that he ordered to stop an illegal pub being built at a bus stand in the rural area of bellary but the action was not taken due to pressure from Labor Minister Parameshwara
 or isliye unhone istipha diya
 Actually Anupama resigned on June 4, and after that, the information related to her is coming only through Facebook
 tazaa apadet main kaha gaya he ki agar shram mantri parameshwar nayak istipha den to anupama apana istipha waapas le sakati hai
 Then further came a post that a CD would be released which would expose the Parameshwara Nayak
 ab is fasebuk post ko lekar bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki kisi ne anupama kaa acount hack kiya he or vahi post kar rahaa he
 No one knows what is true because unless Anupama comes out of the unknown and does not speak, it is difficult to say anything

 The controversy erupted on Thursday by former Bihar Chief Minister and Hindustani Awam Morcha (WE) president Jeetan Ram Manjhi's statement in which he addressed jaish-e-mohammed's master Masood Azhar as 'saheb'
 haalanki, baad main jithan ram maanjhi ne ise ‘jubaan kaa phisalana' bataaya
 This statement was answered in a question by Jeetan Ram Manjhi, an important leader of the grand alliance in Bihar
 yah prashn sanyukta raashtra ke masood ko vaishvik aatankwaadi ghoshit karne se sambandhit tha
 Actually, Manjhi is seen in a video saying 'did the Vajpayee government not take Masood Azhar Saheb from the plane to Kandahar
 ' isse pehle april ke pratham saptaah main rajd ke baisi (purniya) se vidhayak abdus subhan ne kishanganj main yojit ek raily main masood ajahar ko sahab bolaa tha
 Ham's spokesperson Danish Rizwan, however, defended him, saying that Manjhi had said that it was merely slipping
 iske alaava, shuukravaar ko vaishvik aatankwaadi masood ajahar ko 'sahab' kehane vaale hindustani avam morcha ke adhyaksh or purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ne kendriya mantri giriraaj singh or sadhvi pragna thakur ko bhashaai aatankwaadi bataaya
 Manjhi told reporters here that the language of Giriraj Singh and Sadhvi Pragya is the language of a terrorist, and they are linguistic terrorists, who are spewing venom of hate in society

 After repeatedly raising the case of Farooq Abdullah, Amit Shah had to say what can we do if he does not want to come
 unako jabardastee to yahaan laa nahin sakate ki unki canapati par gan rakh kar yahaan par laaen
 Many mps said he was ill
 kuch saansadon ne kaha ki unako aane nahin diya ja rahaa he
 On this, Home Minister Amit Shah said that Farooq Abdullah is absolutely fine
 apane ghar par hai
 Neither they have been detained nor they have been stopped
 vah apni marji se yahaan nahin aa rahe hai
 So what can we do in this? At the same time, Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary of Congress also said that Farooq Abdullah's health is bad, after which Amit Shah had to speak again that if his health is bad then he can go to the hospital, call the doctors
 
 ise lekar loksabhaa adhyaksh om birla ne bhi kaha ki amit shah ko unke liye ek special doctoron kii team bhijwa deni chahie
