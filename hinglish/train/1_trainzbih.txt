 Originally leading parties like BJP and Congress were always in dilemma over reservation
 left front ko bhi jatigat aadhaar par aarakshan ke siddhant kaa samarthan karne main vakt laga
 The Sangh Parivar openly opposed the reservation
 1990 main jab tatkaaleen pradhanmantri vishwanath pratap singh ne pichhadi jatiyon ke aarakshan ke liye mandal ayog kii siforishein lagu karne kaa elaan kiya, to deshbhar main jo mandal-virdohi andolan chal padaa, use in raajnneetik dalon kii shah bhi hasil thi
 BJP also played the stakes of Kamandal to cut Mandal
 aarakshan kaa agar khulkar kisi ne virodh nahin kiya, to uske peeche pichde vot kho dene kaa dar tha, lekin aarakshan ke sawaal par bhartiya samaaj kis kadar banta rahaa, yah vishwanath pratap singh ko lekar bhartiya samaaj kii banty hui raay bataati he
 With his decision to implement the Mandal Commission's recommendations, VP Singh became an absolute messiah for one class and a villain for another
 lekin aarakshan kii raajnneeti sari anichhaaon or duvidhaon se zyaada taqatvar nikali
 In the coming years, the castes standing outside the purview of reservation kept demanding reservation, which became more fast and aggressive in these years
 gujaron or jaaton se shuru hokar ab yah maang patelon or maraathon tak ja pahunchi he or unke liye rajyon ke str par aarakshan ke praavdhaan kiye jate rahe hai
 It is interesting that this politics is gaining maximum glory at a time when the arguments against reservation are getting bigger
 yah baar-baar kaha ja rahaa he ki aarakshan ke phaayde icchit virgon tak nahin ja rahe hai
 Creamy section is taking advantage of it in one way or the other
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki jab sarkari naukariyaan lagaataar kam hoti ja rahi hai, tab is aarakshan kaa kya matlab he
 
 
 Now, parallel to all these arguments, the government has opened the doors of reservation to the general category people as well
 zaahir he, yah 2019 se pehle un savarnon ko lubhaane kii koshish he, jo haal ke dinon main BJP sarkaron ke khilaaf andolan or vot karte nazar aae
 It is also a special thing that the economic basis of the government which has created this 10% reservation can largely comprise the entire middle class
 'times of India' kii report bataati he ki sarkaar dwaara tay aarthik kasautiyon ke aadhaar par desh kii 95 fisadi aabaadi ab aarakshan ke daayre main aa jaaegi
 Actually it is not a reservation given to the poor
 agar hota, to uske liye garibi rekha ke aasapaas kii koi kasuti niyat kii jaati
 This is a reservation given to the forwarders on an economic basis
 jo log maheene main 65,000 rupee kamaate hai, ve is aarakshan kaa laabh le sakate hai
 Obviously, to consider them poor is to insult the poor
 sawaal he, kya sarkaar yah baat nahin samajhati he
 
 
 The Actually, another screw of Indian poverty opens here
 bharat ke zyaadaatar garib pichde, dalit-adivasee or musalmaan hai
 If the poverty line had become the criterion, then the same people would have got there, so they were excluded from the reservation and the reservation of the forwards was ensured
 lekin aarakshan kaa yah shosha kya apni naakaami chhipaane kii sarkaar kii koshish he
 
 
 The Because the same questions are arising here, which are already being asked by anti-reservation
 jab sarkari naukariyaan bachi hi nahin hai, to aarakshan ke vaastavik phaayde kise milenge
 
 
 The But then the communities - Patel, Maratha, Jat, Gujjar - have been asking for reservation, why have they been asking for it
 
 
 ? kyonki aarakshan ke saidhantik virodh kii raajnneeti ko inhen partiyon ne do tarah se istemaal kiya
 He told the reserves that there are no jobs for you, the reservation that is there is just tingling, while telling the people standing outside the scope of reservation that the jobs of your part are being taken by the reservation
 darasal yah samaaj main ghatati naukariyaan or badhati berojgaare he, jo alag-alag samudaayon ko is chhina-jhapati ke liye majaboor kar rahi he
 Previously, castes dependent on agriculture or zamindari or business are also in the grip of economic crisis due to different reasons and they feel that if they get a government job, then their days will improve
 jin logon ko apane liye pichhadaa kaha janaa apni moonch nichi karne ke baraabar lagata tha
 They are all striving for a backward identity - without knowing that even this will not provide a job
 
 
 ? yani sarkaar naukariyaan nahin de paa rahi, rojgaar ke nae intazaam nahin kar paa rahi, lekin aarakshan de rahi he
 It is worth noting that even leaders like Mayawati and Lalu Prasad Yadav are supporting this upper caste reservation, because they know that it is a tingling, which is not ringing
 to phir is aarthik aarakshan se kya milegaa
 
 
 The Simply, the satisfaction that the basic concept of reservation is destroyed
 aarakshan naukariyon main avasar yaa garibi dur karne kaa upkram nahin tha, vah us aitihaasik anyaay se paidaa faasale ko paatane kii koshish tha, jisane kai tabakon ko saamaajik taur par bahut peeche chhod diya tha
 If this reservation had not taken place, Dalits, tribals or backward people would not have had a strong presence in public life, which is visible today
 varanaa varchasvshaalee tabakon ne apni ore se saamaajik-aarthik samanta kii kisi bhi koshish ko naakaam karne main koi kasar nahin chodi thi
 In fact, those who are now saying that instead of reservation were given the opportunity of equalization in education and opportunities, it would have been good, they forget that at the level of government and administration, they had their representatives, who continuously postponed this equality
 
 darasal, aarakshan sirf naukariyon main avasar kaa maamla nahin he, desh ke sansadhano main hissedari kaa bhi maamla he
 Gradually these resources are mostly going to the private sector
 is nijee kshetra kii sanrachana ko dhyaan se dekhen, to aap paaenge ki vahaan bharat ke saamaajik-saanskrithik vaividhya kaa zaraa bhi pratinidhitiv nahin hota he - ulte vahaan bharat kii saamaajik sanrachana main vyaapt aarthik gairbarabari bahut besharmi ke saath jami hui dikhaai padati he
 Nearly all offices are occupied by people of the general category on high and creamy positions, while in those offices the lower-class work - whether it is sweeping, drinking tea, keeping the bathroom clean - all without Backward and Scheduled Castes share the reservation
 nijee kshetra main aarakshan yaa saamaajik vaividhya ke siddhant ko jagah dilaane kii maang barason puraani he, lekin sarkaar yah kaam nahin kar rahi
 The private sector has all kinds of leeway - from reservation, from labor laws, from schemes implemented for the interests of employees, from working hours, and even from corruption
 lekin in sabko durust karne kii jagah sarkaar sarkari naukariyon main aarthik aadhaar par 10 fisadi aarakshan ko aitihaasik faisla bataane main lagi he
 Of course, this is historical - in the sense that it does not open the path of equality, but opens the street of historical injustice and equality, which has deprived the hitherto disadvantaged sections

 Follow Aaj Tak's Twitter handle for every news related to country, world, sports, business and entertainment world: @aajtak upi ke meerut jile main ek paanch saal kii bacchee apni maa ke kaatilon ko pakadvane ke liye apni gullak lekar police thana pahunch gai
 There the girl told the police personnel that "even if i take all the money from my piggy bank, but catch my mother's killers
" ” uski maa seemaa gupta ne sasuraal waalon se tang aakar khudakushi kar lee he
 Manvi took her piggy bank and came to give money to Uncle
 usne ghar main suna tha ki maa ke kaatilon ko pakadaney ke liye police paise maang rahi he
 So he said that take all the money from my piggy bank but catch them due to which the mother left the world
 seemaa kowshik kii maasoom beti maanvi se jab poocha ki kya police ne paise maange the? to usne ”haa” main sir hilaayaa
 When asked what the police said? His answer was, he said bring money
 paise maangane vaale police karmi kaa naam poochne par usne kaha omveer gupta
 Seema was married in the year 2010
 ilzaam he ki use sasuraal vaale dahej ke liye bahut pareshaan karte the
 She was so upset that she left her in-laws house in 2014
 iske baad bhi sasuraal vaale use maansik rup se pratadit karte rahe
 Eventually, Seema committed suicide
 seemaa ke pita shanti swaroop ne bataaya ki “meri ladki ne sasuraal paksh se dukhi hokar aatmahatya kar lee or ham sab jagah dhakke kha-khaakar thak gaye hai
 There was no assurance from anywhere
 vidhayak ji ke dabaav main aakar chhod dete hai
 " seemaa ke maayke waalon ne kul chah aropiyon uske pati, saas, sasur, devar, nanad or nandoi ke khilaaf report darj karai thi
 The police sent the husband to jail
 seemaa ke maayke vaale chaahate hai ki sabko pakadaa jaae
 The comments meerut ke esaspi je rabindra gaur ne kaha ki “hasband or wif alag rah rahe hai or koi sucite note vagairah wo likhakar nahin gai thi
 Nevertheless, the police sent the husband to jail by writing a prima facie case
 baaki aropiyon ke khilaaf avidence collection chal rahaa he
 " seemaa 2014 se pati se alag rah rahi thi, isliye yah sabit karnaa ek chunauti hogi ki uski khudakushi main pati or sasuraal waalon kaa kitna haath he
 But it is also true that why a woman would embrace death by leaving her five-year-old girl alone in the world
 maanvi apni gullak lekar police ankal ko paise dene ke liye pahunchi
 He had heard in the house that the police is asking for money to catch the murderer of the mother
 isliye usne kaha ki meri gullak kaa sara paisa le lo lekin unhen pakad lo jinaki vajah se mummy duniya chhod gai
 When asked by Seema Kaushik's innocent daughter Manvi whether the police had asked for money? So he nodded in "yes"
 jab usase poocha ki police ne kya kaha tha? uskaa jawaab tha, unhone kaha tha paise lekar aana
 Asked the name of the policeman who asked for the money, he said Omvir Gupta
 seemaa kii shaadi saal 2010 main hui thi
 It is alleged that her in-laws used to harass her very much for dowry
 vah itani pareshaan ho gai ki saal 2014 main sasuraal chhodkar maayke aa gai
 Even then the in-laws continued to harass him mentally
 aakhirkaar tang aakar seemaa ne khudakushi kar lee
 Seema's father Shanti Swaroop said that "my girl committed suicide due to unhappiness from her in-laws and we are tired of being attacked everywhere
" kahin se bhi koi aashwaasan nahin mila
 The legislators leave under pressure from the law
 ” Seema's maidens had lodged a report against her husband, mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother-in-law, Nand and Nandoi of six accused
 police ne pati ko jail bhej diya
 Border maids want everyone to be caught
 tippaniyan Meerut SSP j Ravindra Gaur said that "husband and wife are living separately and she did not go on writing any suicide note, etc
" phir bhi police ne pratham drushtya mukadmaa likhakar hasband ko jail bhej diya
 Evidence collection is going on against the rest of the accused
 ” Seema had been living separately from her husband since 2014, so it would be a challenge to prove how much her husband and in-laws are involved in her suicide
 lekin yah bhi to sach he ki koi aurat apni paanch saal kii bacchee ko duniya main tanha chhodkar maut ko gale kyon lagaaegi

 The BJP has sought clarification from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) on the matter, questioning a statement made in the media quoting the interlocutors appointed for Kashmir

 Pakistan has to be involved in this for some solution
 bhaajapa ne isi bayaan kaa hawala dete hue piemo ko katghare main khadaa kiya he
 Party spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said that it is surprising for us if the government has asked the interlocutors to make such statements
 vaartakaron kaa kaam ghati ke vibhinn varg ke logon se baat karnaa or vahaan kii jamini hakeekat ko jaananaa he
 He said that in what context is a negotiator (padgaonkar) referring to Pakistan? Is this statement a part of his jurisdiction or has he gone out of it and said that his statement justifies Pakistan's agenda on Kashmir
 aisa lagata he ki vaartakar is maamle main hurriyat ke nazariye se baat kar rahe hai
 We demand that the PMO give immediate clarification in this matter

 naagarikta bill ke khilaaf guuruuvaar ko supreme court (supreme Court) main pehali yachika daakhil kii gai he
 Hours after the petition was filed, Kapil Sibal, speaking to NDTV, called the CAB unconstitutional and said the court would decide on its validity
 congress netaa kapil sibbal supreme court main indian union muslim lig (IUML) kii pairvi kar rahe hai
 Kapil Sibal also targeted the Union Home Minister Amit Shah during this period
 jab unase poocha gaya ki kya congress party is mudde ko supreme court lekar jaaegi to unhone kaha ki agar amit shah kehete hai ki yah bill vaid he to acha he ki vah supreme court main jaj nahin hai
 Just because they are calling this bill valid, this bill does not prove to be valid
 hamaara maananaa he ki yah bill puri tarah se asanvaidhanik he or court isapar faisla karegi
 Kapil Sibal also spoke about the new Congress partner Shiv Sena in Maharashtra
 unhone kaha ki shivasena is tarah ke muddon par apni raay rakhane ke liye swatantra he
 Let me tell you that while Shiv Sena voted on the Citizenship Amendment Bill in support of the bill in Lok Sabha, it walked out of voting in Rajya Sabha
 sibbal ne kaha ki maharashtra main ham shivasena ke saath ek kaaman minimum program ke tahat saath kaam kar rahe hai
 We have not abandoned our ideology
 mujhe lagata he ki shivasena bhi apni vichaardhaara ke saath hi he
 The Shiv Sena is free to present its stand on such issues
 shivasena ne rajyasabha main voting ke dauraan maujuud nahin the
 And even if he was present, it would not affect the Congress
 sibbal ne kaha ki sarkaar is bill ko lekar nahin aati agar enarasi main jin 19 lakh logon ko baahar kiya gaya unamem badi sankhya hinduon kii nahin hoti
 The BJP did not expect that a large proportion of the 19 lakh people who have been excluded from the NRC are Hindus
 agar yah log musalmaan hote to sarkaar yah bill lekar nahi aati
 Before bringing the bill, the government had also approached the court, but the court refused
 aise main sarkaar ke baad naagarikta sanshodhan bill laane ke alaava or koi vikalp nahin bachataa tha

 ' Ranbir Kapoor made his directorial debut with director Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Saawariya
 is film kii charchaa us samay har jagah thi, haalanki ye box offis par zyada kamaal nahin kar pai
 But the film Sanwaria gave us one of the best actors of Bollywood and thankfully still has fans
 jaisaa ki sabhi ko pataa he sanjay lila bhansaali ek badhiya diarector he, jinke liye unki film main sabakuch parfect hona bahut jaruri he
 Bhansali takes care of the smallest thing in the scenes of his films
 yahi kaaran he ki unki filmein itani khubasurat or hit hoti hai
 Ranbir Kapoor got an opportunity to work with Bhansali in his first film and he told in an interview how his experience was

 ranbir ne kaha, 'maine apane kariyar kii shuruyaat sanjay lila bhansaali se kii thi or wo kuch bhi 45 tech se kam main nahin karte hai

 mere 'towel song' jab se tere naina main ek shot tha, jisamen mujhe kursi par baithkar peeche hona tha or phir neeche girnaa tha or mere towel ko ek alag tarah se girnaa tha, jisase meri taang najar aae
 There was a shot with it where i am taking, i laugh and i have to get up and sing and they are very clear that you have to catch every beat of the song
 wo bahut musical diarector hai- tum is beet par giroge, is par apana sir uthaaoge, is par hansoge- sab kuch musical he
 i gave 45 to 50 tex in a day and my waist was really broken
 agali subah jab main set par waapas aayaa, to unhone kaha, 'nahin, mujhe pasand nahin aayaa' or mujhe 70 tex or dene pade
 'sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Saawariya may not have been a hit, but Ranbir Kapoor definitely got a good recognition in the industry

 The Congress today termed the acquittal of 16 survivors of the PAC personnel accused of killing 42 Muslims in Hashimpura as an injustice, saying the state government should appeal against the order in the upper courts
 party pravaktaa shakeel ahamed ne kaha ki yah bahut ajeeb lagata he ki 42 log maare gaye or itani lambii nyaayik prakriya ke baavjood ek vyakti bhi doshi nahin paaya gaya
 Congress believes that this is injustice
 nyaay nahin ho saktaa he
 He said, we appeal to the government i
e
 SP government of Uttar Pradesh to appeal against it so that no guilty can escape
 uttar pradesh ko aisa karnaa chahie
 If the Government of India needs to do something, they should also do it

 The Congress does not want to lose the case of Rahul Gandhi's spying
 congress ne donon sadanon main is par apana virodh jataayaa
 The Congress knows that only four days are left for the first part of the budget session to end and it knows that a lot of government work is left, especially in the Rajya Sabha
 sarkaar ke paas is satr main apni uplabdhi dikhaane ke liye beemaa bill or motor bill ke alawa kuch nahin hai or use bajet bhi paas karana he
 In such a situation, the government does not want to upset the opposition
 sarkaar kii yah daleel he ki abhi tak 526 logon kii jaanch kii gai he, jisamen pradhanmantri narendra modi kii jaanch 2014 main, bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kii jaanch isi saal or congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi kii ab tak teen baar jaanch kii ja chuki he
 The government says that Delhi Police started this process in 1957, which was reshuffled in 1999
 sarkaar ne yah bhi daleel di he ki rajeev gandhi kii bam blast main hatya ke baad unki pahchaan unke juute kii saij se kii gai thi
 All these figures are with the police which is updated every 3-4 years
 police jo jaankaree maangati he usamen aap kya pahante hai, usamen juute kaa saij bhi he, moonch yaa dadhi kaa rang, ankhon kaa rang, pahchaan ke liye koi vishesh nishaan vagairah
 But the opposition is questioning that they feel that many phones are being tapped, one such case came a few years ago when the call of Arun Jaitley, who was then the Leader of Opposition, was called by a man or an organization
 Recorded independently
 us maamle kii jaanch bhi dilli police ne kii thi
 The police has filed a charge sheet in this case
 yadi suni sunai baton kii maane to sarkaar, uski alag-alag agenciyaan or corporate jagat ko mila den to rojaanaa ek lakh phonon kii tanping kii jaati he
 Spying in our country is like a current
 chandrasekhar kii 40 dinon kii sarkaar se rajeev gandhi ne isliye samarthan vaapis le liya tha ki unke ghar ke baahar do police vaale ghoomte paae jate the or congress party ko laga ki ye rajeev gandhi kii jasusi kar rahe the
 Then what happened was Chandrashekhar's government fell
 abhi philhal aise halaat nahin hai, magar jis bahumat se bijepi kii sarkaar bani he aisa bhram dene main koi dikkat nahin hogi ki sarkaar manamaani kar rahi he
 It also goes with the harsh image of the government
 yahi vajah he ki sarkaar ne dilli police kamishnar ko sansad main talab kiya or ve ghanton sansad main baithe rahe or sarkaar ke liye jawaab taiyaar karne main lage rahe
 Police believe that politics should be kept separate from security
 iske ghalmail se khamiyaja suraksha ko uthaanaa padegaa
 This is a police matter and it should be left to the police
 magar kya karen maamla rahul gandhi se judaa ho to congress peeche hatate kyon dikhnaa chaahegi
 This is the reason that Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma, Digvijay Singh, Naresh Aggarwal of Samajwadi Party and KC Tyagi on behalf of JDU attacked the government on behalf of Congress
 aaj ke halaat main rajyasabha ko nayaa loksabhaa kaha jane laga he kyonki sarkaar ko yahaan vipaksh har mudde par baikfoot main rakh rahaa he
 The Congress is also keeping the issue alive despite Rahul not being present in Parliament and all parties know that whenever the government is in, it keeps an eye on the opposition or its political enemies and the police is just a puppet
 kyonki asli takat to kahin or baithi hoti he or ye khel ek sarkaar ke baad duusari sarkaar tak badastoor jari rahata he or rahegaa
 In Surat, nine people, including five policemen, have been arrested for taking the accused out of jail in the name of treatment

 phir wo aspataal se car main baithkar ghar chalaa jaataa tha or police aspataal main uskaa intjaar karti thi
 When this news emerged in the media, the police registered a case against 12 people, including 5 policemen
 jaanch main pataa chalaa ki police waalon ne brown sugar ke saath pakade gaye shahabuddin naam ke aaropee ko bhi rishwat lekar jail se baahar nikaala tha

 bhubaneshwari ne twit main likhaa, "jab mujhe pataa chalaa ki srisanth kii tabiyat bigadane kii vajah se unhen aspataal main admit kiya gaya he to main pareshaan ho gai thi
 Talked to my team, they are telling that Mr

 After this, Surbhi pushed Sreesanth
 lekin ye maamla yaheen shant nahin hua
 With the intention of harassing Sreesanth on the second day after the task, Surabhi questioned from Shri's career to personal life
 iske baad srisanth kaa gussa bhadkaa or unhone surabhi ko 'kairectorles' tak kah diya
 When there was a ruckus on this word, Shri said, "my point was that she is not playing her character or role properly
 " Do you remember Anil Kapoor's film 'nayak'? In the protagonist released in 2001, the old leaders' box was gutted after Anil Kapoor performed one day as the chief minister
 dilli main arvind kejariwal ne chunaav jeetne ke baad jis tarah ke tabadatod faisle liye hai, uske baad tamaam netaaon kii bolti band he
 Arvind Kejriwal has risen from the midst of the common man to reach the Chief Minister's chair
 unhone apni raajnneetik party ‘aam aadmi party’ banaayi, lekin isse pehle ve inakam tex afasar or ek samaajik kaaryakarta the
 The hero of 'nayak' Shivaji Rao Gaikwad was also a common man who was a minor reporter in a TV channel
 film khaasi safal rahi thi or jab dilli ke ramlila maidan main arvind kejariwal ne dilli ke mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee to vahaan jute logon ke haathon main usee ‘nayak’ film ke poster the
 In these posters, a picture of Arvind Kejriwal was pasted in place of Anil Kapoor
 ‘nayak’ kii tarah hi ab tak arvind kejariwal kaa safar bhi bada hi romaanchak rahaa he
 In many ways, it has gone much further than that because it is a real life story, not on screen
 sutron ke anusaar ab kejariwal kii is safalataa ko film kaa rup dene kii taiyaari bhi chal rahi he
 Anil Kapoor is going to make a sequel to the film 'nayak' soon
 anil kapur ke anusaar unki ‘nayak-2’ 2015 main banegi
 Anil Kapoor says that his film will be completely different from the first film and it will be based on true events
 satya ghatana par aadhaarit hone ke kaaran hi is film ko arvind kejariwal kii safalataa kii kahani se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 The script of the film has been going on for the last almost a year and according to Anil, politics will definitely find a place in this film
 bhartiya film industry aaj jis mukaam par he vahaan tak ise pahunchane main ek bada haath prithviraj kapur kaa bhi he
 He made a huge contribution to Indian cinema not only because of his acting but also because of his behind-the-scenes work in cinema
 prithviraj kapur parde par bhale hi bade sakht najar aate, lekin real jindagi main vah bahut sada the
 Few people know about Prithviraj that he had banned the women of the house from working in cinema
 prithviraj kapur kii 29 may ko punyatithi he
 Had she been alive today, hardly Karisma Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor could have entered Bollywood
 prithviraj kapur nahin chaahate the ki unke khandaan kii koi bhi aurat acting kii duniya main kadam rakhe
 Prithviraj had once accompanied his sister Shanta Kapoor to meet Baburao Patel, the editor-publisher of Film India Magazine
 baburao ne shanta kii ore dekha or kaha ki vah unhen filmon main kaam dilaa saktaa he
 Prithviraj got angry after hearing this
 vah shanta ko ghar laaye or unhen khub danta
 Prithviraj is said to have scolded Shanta for the fact that she pays so much attention to her beauty
 ek report ke mutabik shanta ne kaha- parivaar main rivaaj rahaa he ki koi bahu beti acting nahin karegi
 This is because girls were exploited a lot in the film world

 teraa saal baad ahmedabad kii sadakon par sashastr jawan gasht kar rahe hai or police-pradarshnakariyon kii jhadap kii dastaan sadakon par jali hui gadiyon ke dhuen se nikal rahi he
 The only difference is that during the Gujarat riots in 2002, Narendra Modi was a newbie to the administration of the Chief Minister and in 2015 he is the Prime Minister of the country
 lekin khud ko raajnneeti kaa manza hua khilaadi kehane vaale modi ne apni viraasat aisi shakhsiyat ko kyon saunp di jisaki ek chook ne duniya kii sabase badi rajnatik party kii jubaan band kar di he? bijepi netaaon kii bayaanbaji par bhale roak ho, lekin party main dabi jubaan se yahi sawaal uth rahaa he kyonki chingaari ke sholaa banane kii vajah gujarat kii mukhyamantri anandiben patel kaa vah bayaan tha jisamen unhone sthiti kii gambhirtha samajhe bina aarakshan kii maang ko khaarij kar diya tha
 The case of Gujarat, surrounded by the flames of violence over the demand of reservation for the Patel community, considered economically prosperous, is no longer with the BJP central leadership
 jabaki centre sarkaar or bijepi, donon ke mukhiya gujarat se aate hai
 According to sources, this is seen as an administrative failure of Chief Minister Anandiben Patel in the informal discussion of top leaders at the central level, who could not guess such a huge gathering
 unhone jis tarah andolan se nipatane kii koshish kii, vah bhi kisi ke gale nahin utar rahaa
 But the party's priority is to somehow restore the peace by ending the current violence
 tab tak bijepi ke kisi bhi netaa yaa pravaktaa ko is mudde par bayaan nahin dene kaa do-took nirdesh diya gaya he
 History repeats itself on reservation Three decades later, history is repeating itself in the state
 april 1985 main patel samudaay kii aguai main chal rahe aarakshan-virdohi andolankariyon kii jyadatiyon ke jawaab main police ne usase bhi badhkar jyadatiyon ko anjaam diya tha
 At that time, he turned into hindu-muslim communal violence upon seeing the caste-based movement
 natijatan, agast 1985 main aakhirkaar madhavsingh solanki ko mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lene ke mahaj paanch maheene baad hi kursi chhodmai padi thi
 While the Congress won 149 out of 182 seats in the 1985 assembly elections, the record itself did not break even after the Modi hat-trick victory
 solanki ne shikshan sansthaanon main anya pichhadi jatiyon ke aarakshan main ijapha kar diya tha, jisaki vajah se patelon kaa gussa bhadak uthaa tha
 The same scene appeared to repeat on 25 August, when a record eight lakh Patels converged in Ahmedabad
 unki aguai anjaan shaks se diggaj netaa main badal chukaa ek 22 saal kaa yuvak hardik patel kar rahaa tha
 Hardik is the son of a small businessman from Veeramgam and a convener of the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) and a former supporter of the Aam Aadmi Party
 yah jamaavada gujarat kii aabaadi main 12 fisadi hissedari rakhane vaale taqatvar patel samudaay ko anya pichde varg main shaamil karne kii maang kar rahaa tha
 In his speech before the rally, Hardik challenged not only Anandiben but even Narendra Modi, using select words and adjectives that threaten one after the other
 hardik ne kaha ki patel 2017 ke chunaav main gujarat ke maujuuda hukmaranon ko satta se bedakhal bhi kar sakate hai
 But the atmosphere deteriorated when the police raided the rally site at 8 pm
 vahaan maujuud logon par laathiyaan barasaai gayi or phir hardik ko hiraasat main lekar unhen chupchaap kisi duusari jagah ke liye ravaanaa kar diya
 Not only this, the police also spared the media and destroyed dozens of vehicles with their sticks
 yah khabar jaise hi raily se lautate patelon ko mili, logon ne bason main aag laga di, sarkari pratishthanon main tod-phod kerani shuru kar di
 The angry mob of the Patel community also targeted police outposts and houses of Patel ministers of the state government
 modhera main rajya ke grih mantri rajani patel ke ghar ko aag ke hawaale kar diya gaya
 However, the police left only two hours after Hardik was taken into custody
 lekin isse hinsa nahin rukii or anandiben patel kii lagaataar apilon kaa bhi koi asar nahin hua
 The violence spread from south to north Gujarat and from central Gujarat to Saurashtra in every area in which 10 people died
 26 agast kii subah rail ko bhi nishaanaa banaaya jane laga, jisase ahmedabad se jane vaali trainon ko bhi radd karnaa padaa
 The government also put a stop to the internet to prevent rumors from spreading
 kahaan se upja andolanahardik patel kii mahatvakanksha kii kahani may ke pehle hafte main ahmedabad ke sola main umiya mata shiksha parisar main ek baithak se shuru hui
 The meeting was called to discuss how the Sardar Patel Group (SPG), a Patel-led social organization led by Laljibhai Patel, should train the Patel youth to be elected to the civil services
 saath hi obisi chaatro ko saamaanya shrenee se merit main aane par chhot ne bhi gusse ko bhadakaayaa
 Hardik got an unexpected crowd in a very short time
 ve rajya main 6 july ke baad yojit aisi 100 se zyada reliyon main se chah darjan se zyada reliyon ko sambodhit kar chuke hai
 But at the Ahmedabad rally on 25 July, Hardik announced that the agitators would leave from here only when Anandiben would come here to accept the memorandum
 lekin isamen patel lobby main daraar saamne dikhti he
 Laljibhai said, "hardik's own decision to force Anandiben to come to the rally venue to take the memorandum
 is faisle ko hamaara samarthan hasil nahin tha
 "whose hand on Hardik's back? Hardik's tweets during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections clearly showed that his inclination was towards the Aam Aadmi Party and he was against Modi
" isse is baat ko vajan miltaa ki arvind kejariwal un bade netaaon main se ek ho sakate hai jo unhen peeche se samarthan de rahe hai
 Some samples of Hardik's tweets: 1

 ”bijepi kendriya netritv ko bhi isamen kisi sajeesh kii bu aa rahi he
 The manner in which Kejriwal and Nitish Kumar's closeness has increased before the Bihar elections is also raising doubts
 bijepi ke ek varisht netaa is kadi main youth group sitigens for acounteble gavarnence ke prashanth kishor, jo loksabhaa chunaav tak modi ke ranneetikaar the or ab nitish ke saath hai, kaa bhi naam oochaal rahe hai
 Not only this, the participation of a large number of Patels in the Ahmedabad rally and the activities of Hardik Patel on that day highlighted the fact that the forces working behind them include those local Patel leaders within the BJP, Modi and Anandiben are hurt by their behavior
 bijepi main kuch patel netaa aise bhi hai jo anandiben ko aage badhaane ke kaaran modi se naaraaz hai
 Among these leaders, A
 ke
 Patel (former MP from Mehsana), Arvind Patel and Anil Patel, besides National BJP Vice President Purushottam Rupala

 Raising the arms of his shirt and expressing his national ambitions, he said, "we have a population of 27 crores all over the country

 Nitish Kumar and Chandrababu Naidu also belong to our caste
 ”yah bhi mahatvapurn baat he ki bijepi se congress main aae shankar singh waghela inamen se zyaadaatar patel netaaon ke kaaphi kareebi rahe hai

 This was the time when Patel used to run the community in government and police appointments
 lekin jab modi satta main aae to unhone santulan banane kii koshish kii or jatigat bhaavana rakhane vaale patelon kii jagah vicasonmukh patelon ko tarjeeh di
 Although the Patels still have power in the state, but as a community they do not run in the postings
 jatigat chetana rakhane vaale patel netaaon ko yah baat akhar rahi thi lekin modi kii kushalta or 2002 ke dangon ke baad hindutvvaadi netaa kii unki chhavi ke kaaran ve khamoshi ke saath modi ke saath bane rahe
 a central leader of the BJP argues, "modi as chief minister in Gujarat did not leave any stone unturned to shore up his opponents
" unke zyaadaatar virdohi patel netaa hi the, lekin modi ke gujarat se jane ke maukey kii taak main baithe patel netaa achaanak virodh ke liye maidan main kud pade hai
 However, there are eight Patel ministers in Anandiben Patel's 24-member cabinet
 iske baavjood zyaadaatar patel mantriyon ke gharon ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya or un par pathar phenke gaye
 Anandiben's mistakes On the evening of August 25, when the rally was ended peacefully and were sitting on a heartfelt fast, the barbarous action of the police rekindled the cold movement
 isse yah bhi pataa chal gaya ki police prashasan par anandiben patel or unke grih rajyamantri rajani patel kii koi pakad nahin he
 Despite presenting the example of good administration in many departments, the Home Department is one which has proved weak to the Chief Minister
 police prashasan par unki kamjor pakad kii asli vajah yah he ki police vibhaag main zyaadaatar niyuktiyon main pakshpaat kiya gaya he or yogya adhikariyon ko darkinar kiya gaya he

 Many good IPS officers like Malik and Shamsher Singh have been sidelined
 ahmedabad main 2008 ke bam dhamaakon kii gutthi sulajhane main bhaatia ne pramukh bhoomika nibhaai thi
 While many other police officers do not hesitate to get involved in land related deals for a specific purpose
 modi ke shashan ke dauraan grih mantralay ne ek aadesh jari kiya tha jisamen jameen ke saudon main police ke hissaa lene par roak laga di gai thi
 Following this order, the number of cases of police involvement in land deals had come down to just 34 in a year, compared to around 17,000 in the previous two years
 darasal, anandiben ne july main hue andolan ko halke main liya tha
 At that time, this movement was gradually gaining momentum
 mukhyamantri ne tab is mudde se nibatane kii jimmedaari mantriyon kii ek samiti par chhod di thi
 a few days before the August 25 rally, Anandiben made her first clear statement on the issue that the state government had no role on the issue of reservation, as the Supreme Court had already rejected the demand for reservation for Jats and Marathas
 raily se do din pehle diya gaya unka doosraa bayaan ekadam sahi tha lekin yah kam se kam 20 din kii deree se aayaa tha
 If she had participated in the solution of this problem herself at the end of July, she could have solved the issue
 haalanki unki apni hi jati ke log unke niyantran se baahar ho gaye lekin unhone obisi ko badi safalataa se sambhala
 Due to their efforts, except for sporadic incidents, the fight between Patel vs OBC could not arise in the state
 spasht he ki 1985 main madhavsingh solanki kii tarah hi anandiben ke liye yah pariksha kii ghadi he, khaskar us vakt jab aktubar main hone vaale nagar nikaayon ke chunaav sir par hai
 Now the manner in which the movement of voice-over society from other states has become a national issue, it has also fueled other castes hoping for reservation
 haryana samet naurajyon main jaaton kaa aarakshan radd hone ke baad se hi jat samaaj ne sarkaar par dabaav badha diya he, jabaki obisi kaa ek morcha jaaton ke aarakshan ke khilaaf behad mukhar he
 The struggle of Gujjar reservation in Rajasthan has been going on since 2007, which ever takes a frightening form
 rajya sarkaar ne gurjaron ko 5 fisadi aarakshan ke saath aarthik rup se pichde savarnon ko bhi 14 fisadi kaa aarakshan diya tha jiske baad rajya main supreme court kii ore se tay kota kii seemaa 50 fisadi ke paar chali gai
 In Maharashtra, the reservation of Marathas and Muslims is stuck between the court and politics, while in Chhattisgarh in 2012, the ST quota was increased from 20 to 32 per cent and SC quota from 16 to 12 per cent
 obisi kaa 14 fisadi barkaraar rakhaa gaya
 Here too, the quota is beyond 58 percent
 is maamle main sirf tamilnadu ne kota ko badhaayaa to samvidhan sanshodhan ke jariye use naunvi anusuchee main dalwaaya
 Whereas in the banky states, the political contention only keeps on electoral promises
 isamen do raay nahin ki aarakshan ke andolanon main siyaasi daanvpech kii bhi bhoomika he
 But it needs to understand how it is gaining mass support from the people
 kya yah desh kii aarthik badahaali or gaiyr-baraabar vikaas kii vajah se tool pakad rahaa he? yah jane bagaiyr or aarthik dasha durust kiye bagaiyr is aag se shaayad hi nijaat mili
 (along with Santosh Kumar) ayodhya menram mandirnirmaan kaa maamla ek baar phir supreme court ke baahar charchaa kaa vishay bana he
 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwatwane gave his opinion on many important issues of the country on Wednesday, the last day of the three-day program of the Sangh
 unhone aarakshan, essi-asti kanoon se lekar samalangikta or goraksha jaise muddon par bhi sangh kaa drushtikon saajha kiya
 During this, Mohan Bhagwat called Lord Ram as Imam-e Hind and expressed his desire to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya soon
 ram mandir kaa mudda philhal supreme court main lambit he
 In such a situation, when Mohan Bhagwat was asked in this regard, he tried to build a grand Ram temple at the Ram Janmabhoomi soon
 unhone kaha, 'main sarasanghachaalak ke naate chahta hum ki ram janmabhumi par bhavy mandir jald bananaa chahie
 Lord Rama is God to the majority people of his country but he is not the only God
 unako log imam-e hind maanate hai
 Therefore a temple should be built where Rama's birthplace is
 'mohan bhagwat ne un koshishon par bhi tippanee kii he, jiske tahat ye aawaaj uthati rahi he ki agar supreme court se rasta nahin nikal paata he to modi sarkaar adhyadesh laakar ayodhya main ram mandir kaa nirmaan sunishchit kare
 On this, Bhagwat said that this authority is with the government and i am not in the government
 lekin agar aisa koi kanoon aata he to is baat ko bhi dekhnaa hoga ki kya use chalange nahin kiya jayega
 The hindu-muslim quarrel will end, he further said that Rama's faith is associated with all sections of the society
 jahaan ram kii janmabhumi thi, vahaan mandir pehle tha yah lager kirnon se dekha gaya he
 If the temple was built, a major cause of quarrel between Hindus and Muslims would be reduced
 iske aage unhone jor dete hue kaha ki agar ram mandir nirmaan sadbhaav se hota he to musalamaanon kii ore jo baar-baar ungali uthati he, usamen bahut kami aa jaaegi
 Describing it as a matter of faith of the large sections of the country, he said in the end that the Ram temple should be constructed quickly, whatever may be possible

 bijepi kii is jeet se vipaksh main halchal much gai he, sabase bada bavaal to punjab main hua he
 Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh blamed Navjot Singh Sidhu for this defeat
 ab vah unpar or bhi hamalavar ho gaye hai
 Amarinder has bluntly asked the party leadership to choose Sidhu and one of them
 sutron kii maane to captain amarinder ne kendriya netritv se kah diya he ki navjot singh siddhu kii vajah se punjab or anya rajyon main party ko kaaphi nuksaan hua he
 Now the party has to choose one of them or Navjot Singh Sidhu
 captain ne kaha he ki yaa to siddhu ko party se hi baahar kar den, varanaa punjab se hataa dilli main unhen koi jimmedaari den
 But at the same time he insisted that it would be better to remove Sidhu from the party
 aapako bataa den ki punjab main congress ko 13 main se 8 siten, bijepi-akali dal ko 4 or aam aadmi party ko 1 seat mili hai
 The Congress claimed that it would win all the 13 seats this time in Punjab
 ‘bajva ko gale milanaa pad gaya baari’darasal, guuruuvaar ko jab nattejey aae to uske baad hi captain amarinder singh ne navjot singh siddhu par haar kaa thikra phoda tha
 Amarinder Singh had said that the party's cost to Navjot Singh Sidhu's hug from Pakistani Army Chief Javed Bajwa was costly
 kisi bhi hindustani ko ye baat raas nahin ai
 The attack on Navjot Singh Sidhu not only in the party but also on social media has intensified
 unhone pehle kaha tha ki agar rahul gandhi amethi se chunaav haarate hai, to vah raajnneeti chhod denge
 Now that Rahul has lost in Amethi, people are reminding him of his old statement on social media
 ab kya karenge siddhu?navjot singh siddhu bhartiya janata party chhod kar hi congress main aae the
 When he was in BJP, he used to curse the Gandhi family fiercely, but when he changed, his color was different
 siddhu congress main aae to unhone khud ko janmajaat congressi kaha, or phir narendra modi-amit shah ko jamkar kosa
 He was the highest attacker in the entire campaign
 aise main siddhu ke liye congress se agar baahar ke rasta dikhaaya jaataa he, to unke liye kisi anya party main janaa yaa phir waapas bijepi main mushkil ho saktaa he

 On coming ashore, these fishes died yearning for water
 jab bandar se poocha gaya ki usne in machhliyon ko kyon baahar nikaala to usne jawaab diya ki wo in machhliyon ko pani main doobane se bachaa rahaa tha
 Owaisi said that the government's attempt to get Muslim women is like that monkey

 On Thursday, the Lok Sabha passed the triple talaq bill
 ab is vidheyak (bill) ko rajyasabha main pesh kiya jayega
 If the Modi government also passes this bill in the Rajya Sabha, then it will be sent for the approval of the President
 raashtrapati ke hastakshar hone ke baad yah vidheyak kanoon ban jayega
 The bill will now be discussed in the Rajya Sabha, where the bjp-led NDA government does not have a majority

 They are also demanding amendments

 piem modi ne rishikesh menswami dayanand ashram jaakar apane guru kaa haal-chaal poocha
 It was informed from the ashram that Modi requested Dayanand Giri to have dialysis
 guruji kii sehat kharaab he
 The 16-year-old relationship with Guru is the relationship of Swami Dayanand Giri and PM Modi
 solah saal pehle bhi modi rishikesh ke dayanand ashram main aae the
 Whenever Modi faced a difficult problem, then he took knowledge from the Guru
 gandhinagar bulaakar kiya tha swagatanarendra modi jab gujarat ke mukhyamantri the, tab unhone bade aadar ke saath apane guru dayanand giri ko gandhinagar bulaakar unka swaagat kiya tha
 a profound impact on Modi's life is that 86-year-old Swami Dayanand Giri's great quality is that he can also solve today's problems through Vedanta
 yahi vajah he ki modi ke jivan par apane guru kaa gaharaa prabhaav he
 Award-winner from the United Nations Dayanand Giri is the director of Dayanand Saraswati Ashram in Rishikesh and Arsh Vidya Gurukulam in Coimbatore
 unke ashram se deshbhar main sau se zyada shiksha ke centre chalaae jate hai
 Dayanand Ashram has also received the award from the United Nations in the year 2005 due to his excellent work for education and health
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne main varsej wild sho ke special episod main bear grills kaa garmjoshi ke saath swaagat kiya
 The two met in Jim Corbett
 bear grills tay samay se 15 minute pehle hi pahunch chuke the
 After this, PM Modi's entry in the show
 piem modi ne kaha ki bear grills ke saath yah safar kaaphi romaanchak hone vaala he
 During the conversation, PM Modi told Bayer Grylls that you have come to India for the first time
 is par bear ne jawaab diya ki main pehali baar bharat nahin aayaa hum
 First came to India at the age of 18
 piem modi ne bataaya ki agar ham prakruti ke saath sangharsh karenge to manushya bhi khatarnaak lagegaa
 PM Modi said that forests, animals, animals and environment are being created for humans
 modi bear grills ke saath mil kar ek bhaalaa taiyaar karte hai or isi dauraan bear poochhate hai ki maine suna he ki bachapan main aapane jangalon main bahut vakt guzaara he? modi kehete hai ki main himalay jaataa tha
 He says that i left home at the age of 17–18
 soch rahaa tha kya karun kya naa karun
 i loved nature
 jangalon main ghoomane se kaise badale modibair jab poochhate hai ki kya in chizon kaa aapke astitv par asar padaa to jawaab main modi jawaab main kehete hai ki aaj bhi wo takat he
 Bayer tells Modi that you are the most important person in India and my job is to protect you
 modi ko bhaalaa dete hue bear kehete hai ki yadi koi baagh aapaki taraf aata he to aap isse use maar dijie
 However Modi replies that my values do not allow me to kill him
 is par jab bear bhaalaa waapas lene lagate hai to modi kehete hai ki main ise aapke liye apane paas rakhuunga
 < jab maujuuda steel udyog maang main kami se pareshaan ho or madad maang rahaa ho to centre sarkaar rajyon ke saath nai steel companiyaan kyon banane ja rahi he? chote udhyamiyon ko karj dene ke liye nae sarkari bank (mudra bank) kii kya jarurat he jabaki kai sarkari vittiya sansthaaen yahi kaam kar rahi hai? ganga safai ke liye sarkari company banane kii jarurat kyon he jabaki vibhinn agenciyaan va pradooshan niyantran board isi kaa kama-kha rahe hai? vyavsaayik shiksha or rojgaar nijee kshetra se milane hai to skill deveopment ke liye adhikariyon kaa nayaa kader banane kii kya jarurat he? sarkari skiimon kii bhavy vifaltaaon ke baad mishan or skiimon kii gavarnence hamen kahaan tak le jaaengi? kya ab bhi vah vakt nahin aayaa he ki railway, koyala, banking jaise kshetron main sarkari ekadhikaar khatm kiya jaae or sarkari companiyon va bainkon kaa nijeekaran kiya jaae?farvari kii 13 taarikh ko jab mumbai main mek in india ke pehle salanaa jalse main duniya bhar kii companiyaan (60 deshon se 1,000 companiyon ke aane kii sambhaavna) jutengi to unke dimag main aise sawaal gunj rahe honge
 In fact, the biggest grievance of investors is not that the BJP has lost bihar-delhi but to prove the apprehension that it is slowly returning to government-controlled governance, which contradicts the expectations of a return to reformist free economy with the BJP
 raajnneeti main dakshinpanth, vampanth, samaajwaad, secularavaad, jatvaad, rashtrawaad kii chaahe jo chhaunk lagaai jaae lekin aam logon ne tajurbon ke aadhaar par sarkaron ko sudhaarak maanane ke apane paimaane tay kiye hai
 Interestingly, investors and entrepreneurs also agree to the same criteria that most people of the country have set
 tej aarthik sudhaar, aay main badhotaree or rojgaar dene vaali sarkarein na keval logon kii chaheti rahi hai balki niveshkon ne bhi inhen sir ankhon par bithaaya
 This is the reason why Modi's grand mandate was for fast growth, free market and employment generating government
 aarthik sudhaaron kii damakati safalataa ne yah sunishchit kiya he ki mukt bazaar or nijee udhyamita ke prabal pairokaar ko bharat main sudhaarak rajaneta mana jayega
 Expectations of Modi to be the champion of the free market are because he is close to the open market and Modi has been influenced by the past of Gujarati entrepreneurship
 congress ne iklusive growth kii jid main udaarikaran par jo bandishen thope di thim, modi unhen khatm karne vaale maseehaa ke taur par ubhare the
 However, in the last 18 months, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not even made ten such decisions which theoretically or practically prove his government to be courageous reformers or advocates of free market
 duusari taraf aise faislon kii fehrist lambii he jo modi sarkaar ko band bazaar, sangrakshanvaad kii himachati yani vampanthi aarthik darshan ke kareeb khadaa dikhaati he
 The Modi government has laid the foundation of half a dozen new government companies in the last 18 months
 duusari taraf banking, air india, railway or kol india ke vinievesh yaa khudara kaarobaar main videshi nivesh par pasinaa aa gaya he or vishwa ke deshon se mukt vyapaar samjhauton par swadeshi haaavee ho gaya he
 Expectations of Modi becoming the Messiah of Liberalization were unshaken
 pichley do dashak ke aankade or anubhav, donon hi yah sabit karte hai ki sarkaar ne nahin, bazaar ne bharat kaa uddhaar kiya he
 In the next decade after the reforms in 1991, over-poverty in India has reduced by about ten percent, with the major contribution being to increase the income of the people, which has increased due to employment from private sector
 aarthik udaarikaran kii sutaradhar hote hue bhi congress ne pichley ek dashak main gavarnence badalane kaa koi jokhim nahin liya isliye shuruaati safaltaaon ke baad aarthik sudhaar daagi hote chale gaye
 When Modi was talking about the Minimum Government, he realized that perhaps he has understood the expectations, because the Minimum Government comes with all aspects of sorting bureaucracy, bringing all kinds of transparency, administrative reforms, which have tainted the growth in India
 
 iske vipareet modi sarakar ek nayaa skimraj lekar aa gai jo ise maximum gavarnence jaisaa banaata he
 The reforms we mentioned were the least expected of Modi
 darasal, sarkaar ko to iske aage jaakar bazaar main kism-kism ke cartil taadne , korporate gavarnence, rajyon main nijeekaran, nae niamakon kaa gathan or rajnatik dalon main paardarshita jaise kadam uthaane the, jinase bharat main doorgaami badlaavon kii disha tay honi he
 This stark reality is now being felt in government circles that it is a governance laden with schemes, bureaucracy and protectionism that has neither touched the lower strata nor has created any enthusiasm among youngsters and investors and entrepreneurs
 is
 mek in india sammelan main logon ke jehan main ve aankade bhi tirenge jo gavarnence ke liye pehali badi chunauti kaa syran baja rahe hai
 Whether by dividing the economic scenario into agriculture, industry, foreign trade or on the central, state and international sides, this is the first time that red lights have blown together in many areas like agriculture, exports, industry, employment and reforms to economic debate
 Are turning to crisis management instead
 2014 ke janadesh ke baad logon ne narendra modi main margaret thatcher, ronaald regan or lee kwan you kii jhalak dekhi thi jo saahas or sankalp se apane deshon kii kayapalat ke liye jane jate hai
 Modi has to be Atal Bihari Vajpayee before becoming Thatcher, Regan, who overshadows the Modi government's 18 months in thought, resolve and inclusiveness
 ab bijepi kii chunauti kisi rajya main satta main pahunchnaa haragij nahin honi chahie
 The government has to stop making the impression that India has not found the reformer we were looking for as Narendra Modi
 kya 2016 kaa bajet is dharna ko khaarij karne kii shuruyaat karegaa? Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, Chairman of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) E
 shridharan kaa istipha naamanzoor kar diya he
 Sreedharan resigned from the post taking moral responsibility for the Metro accident
 dilli metro ko shridharan kii zyada jaruratsamajha ja rahaa he ki abhi bhi na keval dmarsi, balki dilli ko bhi shridharan kii zyada jarurat he, isiilie unka istipha sweekaar nahin kiya gaya
 Earlier, Sreedharan sent his resignation to Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit
 unhone kaha tha ki ve metro haadase ke liye sidhe taur par jimmedaar nahin hai, phir bhi dmarsi ke mukhiya hone ke naate istipha de rahe hai
 5 people were killed
 It is worth mentioning that 5 people died and 15 people were injured due to the collapse of an under construction bridge of Delhi Metro
 iske baad mukhyamantri shila dikshit ne dughartna kii jaanch kaa aadesh dete hue kaha tha ki is maamle main javabdehi tay kii jaani chahie
 Sridharanpada Vibhushan, Bharat Shiromani, Man of the Year, the owner of the charismatic personality, and many more awards are named after Matroman e Sreedharan, but this man agreed to say goodbye to the Metro
 railway kii naukari se ritair hone ke 19 saal baad tak shridharan is mulk kii seva karte rahe
 Challenges become a left-handed sport for them even at this age, their farewell would hardly be liked
 kai mahatvakankshi pariyojnaon ko kiya puraa77 saal ke shridharan kerala ke palghat main padhe likhe or kerala main hi kakinada se ejineering kii
 He started a railway career in 1954 after a year of apprenticeship at Bombay Port Trust
 pehali kamyaabi shridharan ke naam rahi 1963 main, jab unhen hai tide se tabah rameswaram ke railway pul ko record 46 din main dobaaraa taiyaar kar daalaa
 In 1970, the responsibility of Kolkata Metro was also entrusted to Sreedharan and then the first ship of Cochin Shipyard was also prepared under the leadership of Sreedharan
 1990 main railway se hue ritair1990 main railway se shridharan ritair hue to fouran unhen konkan railway kii jimmedaari de di gai
 Perhaps this task was even more difficult because in an area like Konkan, laying tracks on raw soil and extracting tunnels from them was not a matter of anyone else's bus
 inhen sab kamyaabiyon ne unhen desh kii shaan dilli metro ke pramukh kii kursi par laa bithaaya
 Sreedharan had decided that in 2005 he would leave everything and rest, but perhaps he also felt a sense of responsibility for the country's prestige in the 2010 Commonwealth Games, so he continued to shoulder this heavy responsibility till date
 nitish kumaar bihar ke mukhyamantri nahin hai
 His decision to resign is being seen in many ways
 magar in dekhne waalon ko aap bhi ek prakaar se dekh sakate hai
 Look at the surnames of Nitish's critics on media or social media
 aap samaj sakenge ki kyon inamen 'jaat paat se upar uth chuke' apper cast kii bahulata adhik he
 Something must have happened on the ground which is passing the upper castes exasperatingly
 agar aisa he to nitish is tabake ko ab waapas nahin laa sakate hai
 After all, why the forward castes could not see the seen development of Bihar and the heard of Gujarat was tested
 loksabhaa ke chunaav main bihar ne nitish kumaar ko asweekaar kiya he
 Nitish's model of inclusive development could not sustain communal integration in his own words, perhaps because the ideology element in his model was or was not very weak compared to Modi's model
 kai log kehete hai ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa aupchaarik swaagat karnaa padataa isliye kursi chhod kar bhaag gaye
 On my Facebook page, there are more Savarnas among such writers and those sending SMS
 jis tarah se savarna nitish ko jativaadee tehra rahe hai mujhe jaat paat ke samaapt ho jane ke swarna yug kaa bhram hone laga he
 Well, for fear of Modi's welcome, resignation pleaded
 nitish kumaar ne kaha he ki ek saal tak party kaa kaam kar use majboot karenge or bahumat praapt karenge
 JDU has also said that the next election will be fought under Nitish's leadership
 mere khyaal se narendra modi tab tak to pradhanmantri rahenge hi! agar yahi dar hota to nitish raajnneeti se sanyas le lete
 Therefore, there is no special feeling that under the protocol, Narendra Modi had to be welcomed, so Nitish resigned
 kya protocol ke tahat narendra modi, manmohan singh kaa apane rajya main swaagat nahin karte the
 Somewhere, more than Nitish's fear, BJP leaders did not dream that they would be welcomed to see the redness of Nitish's face
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki nitish kaa istifa bahes yogya nahin he
 If asked for resignation from Nitish, he gave it raajnneeti main naitikta pratikatmak hi hoti he
 No one resigns even after the riots to give a message and someone gives it in case of an accident
 narendra modi or akhilesh yadav ne naitik zimmedaari to lee magar istifa nahin diya
 It is not easy to resign for one year in the Bihar Assembly elections
 ho saktaa he ki arvind kejariwal kii tarah ek din is faisale par afsos karnaa pad jaae, lekin yah qadam itnaa bhi khokhla nahin he
 In the previous two Lok Sabha elections, when the people of India were supporting the UPA, then the people of Gujarat stood with Narendra Modi
 uske is faisale main sirf vikaas hi nahin chah karod gujaratiyon ke naam par kiya gaya ekikaran yaa dhruvikaran bhi tha, lekin bihar kii janata ne nitish kaa saath nahin diya
 The element of ego fight was also there in Modi vs Sonia
 ek patrkaar tivi channel par kah rahe the ki aaj bihar kaa sabase bada netaa ek gujarati he
 If Nitish does not resign, then what is not said or what is not being said about the stability of his government
 istife kii maang to kii hi ja rahi thi
 It was being said that there would be rebellion, BJP would not leave, etc
 yah saafe he ki donon ke bich ahan kaa takaraav he or donon taraf se he
 Ideological confrontation must also be accepted
 isliye bihar main satta badalani hi thi
 Nitish could not hold Bihar even after two hundred rallies
 lekin ab baat istifa kyon diya se aage nikalakar dene ke baad jo kiya us par honi chahie
 The Mushar caste is one of the poorest castes of the state and country
 is jati kaa zyaadaatar hissaa garibi rekha se neeche hai or bhoomihin he
 What is not said about the plight of the poorest caste eating rat
 is jati ke jithan ram maanjhi ko nitish ne mukhyamantri banaaya he
 At the level of the symbol, it is a bold decision
 bijepi ko remote control kii baat se itnaa gurez hota to vah sangh ke darvaaze netaa se lekar mantri ke chayan tak ke liye nahin jaati
 Remote is a fact in Indian politics
 yah sachai bijepi se lekar har dal main he
 Does Badal or Paswan's family party not have remote control
 kya narendra modi pradhanmantri banane ke baad gujarat main nae netaa ke chunaav main dakhal nahin rakhenge
 Whose decision will be taken in the name of legislators, everyone knows
 ve bhi jab anandiben ko mukhyamantri chunenge to ise pratik ke str par badha chadha kar bataaya jayega
 Narendra Modi himself has been fiercely selling his tea and using symbols of backward caste background
 isliye pratik ke str par hi sahi jithan ram maanjhi kaa mukhyamantri bananaa aitihaasik he
 They are losers, but political utility and existence do not end with defeat
 is lihaaz se arun jetali bhi haare hue hai or unhen mantri nahin bananaa chahie
 What is less that BJP is not able to accuse Nitish of casteist politics
 is faisale ne party par nitish kii pakad ko sthapit to kiya hi he unka aatmavishvaas bhi zaahir kiya he
 At a time when there is unfavorable and aggressive power in Delhi, trusting to hand over your chair to someone else is not just a weak trick
 ek party ke rup main jediu kaa is faisale ko sweekaar karnaa bhi kam badi baat nahin he
 There are as many mlas and as long as they are with this decision
 is chunaav main mili bhayankar haar ke baad apni party kii vichaardhaara or netaa main bharosa rakhana bataa rahaa he ki raajnneeti main sabakuch kareed bechakar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 And even if there is a rebellion, there is no surprise in the state where the best MP like Raghuvansh Prasad Singh goes
 ek aise samay main jab puure desh main narendra modi kii prachand kamyaabi ke baad vipaksh manouvaigyanik rup se bikhar gaya he, nitish satta chhodkar vipaksh banane ke liye sangharsh karne ja rahe hai
 Even after losing, they are taking the risk of walking on the same path
 lalu yadav jail jane par har baar satta or party apane parivaar ko hi saunpte rahe hai, mulaayam or mayawati bhi jo nahin soch sakate nitish ne karke dikhaa diya
 They can accept the leadership of anyone else in the party right in the name of the remote
 ab yahaan sawaal kuch or bhi he
 Has the power to stop the kamandal like the nineties remained in the board
 kya narendra modi ke hindutvvaadi, jativaadee or vikaas kii bahuaiami raajnneetik package kaa muqaabala jatigat asmita, dalit pichhadaa ekta, samaajawaadee dhara or vikaas kii raajnneeti ke package se kiya ja saktaa he
 Is this election also a mandate that the upper caste castes can never live naturally with the Dalit backward castes
 kabhi vikaas to kabhi hindutv ke bahaane alag hoti rahati hai
 Therefore, the unity of the Dalit backward should be established instead
 uttar pradesh main kanshiram ne mulaayam ko mukhyamantri banaakar kamandal ko roak diya tha
 Later, this experiment fell to trivial political trickery
 kya mayawati mulaayam ek honge
 Will Nitish Lalu be the same
 bijepi ne bhi to is chunaav main bhrashtachar ke muddon ko kinare kar yedurappa se lekar paswan tak se haath milakar jatiyon kaa behatar gathbandhan karke dikhaa diya
 Will Lalu Nitish Mulayam Mayawati do this to save her existence
 yah sab itnaa aasaan nahin he
 Nitish has come out to do what may have to go a long way
 ek or haar mil sakati he
 Lalu Yadav and Nitish will disintegrate on who will be the leader
 jabatak bikhare rahenge bijepi yaa pichde narendra modi kii jatigat or hindutv kii vyuh rachana se maat khate rahenge
 Any caste-based strategy against a backward Prime Minister who has reached the post of frontier will give rise to interesting and unpredictable political conflicts and disintegration among the Dalit backward classes
 iske liye zaruri he ki mandal ke daur ke baad dalit or pichhadon main taiyaar hua madhyamvarg is prayog main saath aae
 He went with the BJP even when leaders like Ramdev and CP Thakur were opposing the reservation
 sanjay paswan jaise netaa aarakshan par shwet patr laane kii baat kar ise aarthik aarakshan main badlaav kii baat kar rahe the
 The BJP had openly opposed the issue of reservation in promotions in Parliament
 iske baad bhi bijepi ko daliton pichhadon kaa saath to mila hi
 Therefore, Nitish should not see Jitan Ram Manjhi as a symbol of the Congress era
 mandal kii raajnneeti ke pratik pratik hi na rah jaayen
 Nitish Kumar has realized the need for the right organization of late
 narendra modi ne bijepi sangh or anya dharmik or yoga sikhaane vaali peshewar sansthaaon main samaajwaadiyon kii is kamazori kaa bhi khub laabh uthaaya he
 It was Nitish's biggest weakness that he did not make JDU a party of youth of Bihar
 vikaas kii amoort raajnneeti ke saath saath ve apni party ko fesabook or twitor janareshan ke liye kholte yaa jodate to nateeja kuch or ho saktaa tha
 Nitish left Bihar's development as a kite, while Narendra Modi made the whole of Gujarat a hitchhiker in the politics of opposition and development
 gujarati asmita ke naam par pahchaan kii raajnneeti kii nai packaging kii
 Nitish Kumar relied on cardboard packaging
 bihari asmita nahin ubhaar paae
 Nitish Kumar should keep in mind that Modi cannot be stopped only by ideological battles
 agar modi chaar kilometre sadak banaate hai to mulaayam or nitish ko das kilometre sadak banani hogi
 The speed of work of your government has to be increased so that people can see it happening
 nitish gum-gum kar rahul gandhi kii tarah adhyayan na karen to acha rahegaa balki sarkaar kii kamiyon ko vahiin kaa vahiin fiks kara den to zyaada vishwaas hasil kar sakenge
 People should feel that the government of Bihar has really become a bullet train and Nitish is not its driver and pilot
 ejeeniyar nitish kumaar ko soshal ke saath-saath is ejineering main bhi kamaal dikhaanaa hoga
 You have to do more than what you have done and you have to do more publicity than that

 The rating for the film is -1 star

 Before the Lok Sabha elections, there has been a discussion of surgical strike in the country once again
 congress ne pichley dinon daawa kiya tha ki upie kaarykaal ke dauraan 6 sargical strike kii gai thi, lekin tatkaaleen sarkaar ne isaki charchaa nahin kii, haalanki is daawey ke ulat raksha mantralay kaa kahana he ki 2016 se pehle bhartiya sena kii ore se aise kisi strike kii soochna uske paas nahin he
 This defense ministry statement came in response to a question asked under RTI
 jammu ke soochna ke adhikaar (artiai) ke ek kaaryakarta kii ore se maange gaye sawaal ke jawaab main raksha mantralay kaa yah bayaan congress kii aguwai main kai upie netaaon ke daavon main virodhabhas dikhaata he
 The Congress says that 6 surgical strikes were carried out during his tenure but he was never used for votes
 sargical strike ko lekar in dinon bhartiya janata party or congress ke netaaon ke bich jari jubaani jang ke bich india today ke paas artiai ke tahat raksha mantralay se sargical strike ko lekar maange gaye sawaal kaa jawaab maujuud he
 The Defense Ministry says that it has only the data of a single surgical strike which was done in response to the 2016 terrorist attack in Uri in North Kashmir on 29 September
 2004 se 2014 ke bich kitne sargical strike?jammu main rahane vaale artiai kaaryakarta rohit choudhary ne raksha mantralay main artiai daakhil karte hue 2004 se 2014 ke bich sargical strike ke bare main jaankaree maangi thi
 The Ministry of Defense responded through the DGMO that it had the data of a single surgical strike carried out by the Army which was done across the Line of Control on September 29, 2016
 artiai kaaryakarta kii ore se yah artiai 2018 main daakhil kii gai thi
 Talking to India Today, Rohit Chaudhary said that Congress was lying in front of people about surgical strikes, no strike was done during UPA tenure
 bhartiya sena kaa apmaanah rahul gandhihal hi main congress ne daawa kiya tha ki uske kaarykaal ke dauraan 6 sargical strike kiye gaye the, lekin pradhanmantri narendra modi ne iskaa majaak udaaya or seemapar congress ke sargical strike ke daawey ko khaarij kar diya
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi also on Saturday surrounded the Modi government on the surgical strike, saying that former Army Chief General Vikram Singh said that the UPA government made 6 surgical strikes between 2008 and 2014 and also gave the dates of surgical strikes
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha ki pradhanmantri modi ne upie kaarykaal ke sargical strike ko video game kahkar bhartiya sena kaa apmaan kiya he
 He further said that the army is not Modi's personal property
 sargical strike bhartiya sena ne kiya na kii congress ne
 But when he calls it a video game, he is insulting the Indian Army
 record maujuud he
 a few days ago, Congress leader Kapil Sibal claimed that during the UPA tenure, a surgical strike was carried out in the name of Operation Ginger in 2011
 unhone aage kaha, 'oparation ginger, 2011 main hui sargical strike jhooth nahin he
 Army chiefs cannot lie, we are trying to say that surgical strike is not a celebratory thing, it is a means to keep our country and border safe, but is it happening? Manmohan Singh has never beaten it, but look at Modi, the young men are dying, and they are telling it

 What the Eastern and Northern Municipal Corporations have said in the Delhi High Court is questioning the claims of the Municipal Corporation itself
 purvi dilli nagar nigam or uttari dilli nagar nigam ne dilli hycourt main buudhvaar ko hui sunwaayee main kaha he ki unhone disambar tak kaa karmchaariyon kaa vetan de diya he, jabaki janvari 2016 ke baad ke vetan kaa paisa unke paas nahin he
 The argument that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi has made in the High Court is therefore startling and raising questions, because till now the Mayor of the Municipal Corporation was openly claiming that the employees went on strike due to non-payment of salary for three months
 ab sawaal ye he ki sach kya he? wo jo meyar bolte rahe yaa jo adaalat ke samaksh rakhaa gaya?tippaniyan If we assume that facts and credible are considered more than what is said before the court, not in front of the media, then the question will arise that if the salary was paid till December, then only one month's salary will be late
 When that happened, at the end of January, how did the municipal employees go on strike since January 27? vaise hoicourt ne dilli sarkaar or dilli nagar nigam ke vivaad par centre sarkaar se jawaab dene ko kaha he
 Earlier, the Delhi government and the three municipal corporations filed their reply in the court, the next hearing will be on 10 February
 dilli nagar nigam ne hoicourt main jo daleel rakhi he wo isiilie chaunkaa rahi he or sawaal khadey kar rahi he, kyonki abhi tak nagar nigam ke meyar khulkar daawa kar rahe the ki teen maheene se vetan na milane ke kaaran karmchaaree hadtaal par gaye
 Now the question is, what is the truth? The one who kept speaking the mayor or who was placed before the court? agar maan len ki tathy or vishwasaneey vahi zyaada mana jaataa he jo adaalat ke saamne kaha jaataa he, media ke saamne vaala nahin to aise main sawaal uthegaa ki agar disambar tak kaa vetan diya ja chukaa tha, to phir keval ek maheene kaa vetan hi der hua wo bhi janvari khatm hone par phir 27 janvari se hi nagar nigam karmchaaree hadtaal par kaise chale gaye? However, the High Court has asked the Central Government to reply on the dispute between the Delhi Government and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi
 isse pehle dilli sarkaar or teenon nagar nigam ne apana jawaab adaalat main daakhil kiya, agali sunwaayee 10 farvari ko hogi

 ek mahila kaa apane jivan or sharir par sampurna niyantran kaa sangharsh nishchit rup se raajnneetik he, lekin nariwadi raajnneeti or isaki samasyaayein raajnneetik dalon kii sankeern duniya se adhik vyapak he
 Therefore, political parties are requested not to convert this important discussion about gender, power and violence into mutual 'tu-tu main-main'

 In the last one week, many television experts have questioned my motives
 kuch logon ne mere dwaara shikaayat karne main liye gaye vakt ko lekar sawaal uthaaya
 Some curious commentators even questioned the use of the term 'sexual harassment' instead of 'rape'
 mere saath jo hua use kya kaha jaae, is bare main sochakar mujhe sabase zyada pidaa hui
 i do not know if i am willing to see myself as a 'rape victim'
 yaa phir mere sahyogi, dost, samarthak or aalochak
 No victim defines the crime that has taken place

 The political equations of the Saharanpur Lok Sabha seat are completely changed after the grand rally of the grand alliance in Deoband in western Uttar Pradesh on Sunday
 is muslim bahul seat par mahagathbandhan kii ore se bahujan samaaj party ke haji fajalurrahman, congress kii ore se imran masood or bijepi kii ore se raghav lakhan paal maidan main he
 As two Muslim candidates are in the fray for the Saharanpur seat, the grand alliance clearly saw the fear of Muslim votes being split
 yahi vajah rahi ki mayawati ne musalamaanon se vot kii sidhi apil karke congress ke imran masood kii mushkilen badha di hai
 From the coalition platform, Mayawati repeatedly warned the Muslims of Saharanpur that they should not allow their votes to be divided
 congress is laayak nahin he ki wo bijepi ko takkar de sake, jabaki mahagathbandhan ke paas majboot aadhaar he
 In such a situation, do not allow your votes to be scattered and unite to vote in favor of the coalition candidate
 mayawati ne kaha ki ye baat congress ko bhi pataa he, lekin vah ye maanakar chal rahi he ki congress na jite to gathbandhan bhi na jite
 Do not let such dreams succeed
 mayawati kii apil se muslimon main bada sandeshbaspa supremeo ne kaha ki saharanpur seat par basapa ne bahut pehle hi apane ummidavaar ke naam kaa elaan kar diya tha
 While no candidate was named finalist from Congress
 aise main congress ne jab dekha ki basapa ummidavaar muslim he to unhone bhi muslim pratyaashee utaar diya
 Congress has no other vote in Saharanpur
 jabaki basapa kaa apana base vot he
 Now the Jat vote of RLD is also with us along with SP
 aise main muslim kisi bhi bahekaave main aakar apane vot ko na bantane den, balki balki basapa ummidavaar haji fajalurrhaan ke paksh main vot karen
 Mathematics of voters is also not in favor of Imran
 Saharanpur Lok Sabha seat is very important in western UP according to the results, political and caste equation
 bijepi dhruvikaran or bantwaare ke bal par apni jeet ko barkaraar rakhane kii ummid laage hue he
 At the same time, Imran Masood of Congress is in the process of reaching parliament with the help of Muslim votes
 jabaki sapa-basapa-areldi gathbandhan ke haji fajalurrahman apni kamyaabi dalit, muslim or jat maton ke sahare dekh rahe hai
 In terms of political equation, there are a total of 17,22,580 voters in Saharanpur Lok Sabha seat
 inamen kareeb chah lakh muslim, saadhe teen lakh dalit, pachaas hajaar ke kareeb jat matadaata hai
 In such a situation, victory seems impossible only with the help of Muslim voters
 mujffarnagar sampradayik dange ke chalate pichley loksabhaa chunaav puri tarah se dhruvikaran kii buniyaad par hua tha, jisamen musalamaanon ne ek tarafa congress ko samarthan diya tha or hindu matadaata bijepi ke saath chale gaye the
 This is the reason why Raghav Lakhanpal was successful in feeding the lotus
 imran masood raajaneejik parivaar se aate hai
 At one time, the Qazi family had a major say in Saharanpur politics
 imran apane bayanon ko lekar vivaadon main bhi rahe hai, lekin unki haar kaa silsilaa lagaataar jari he
 They are losing for the last four elections including assembly and Lok Sabha
 imran ko 2014 kii haar kaa hisaab lene ke liye jor lagaana hoga, lekin is baar aankadon ke lihaaj se majboot gathbandhan ke fajalurrahman unke liye badi chunauti ban gaye hai
 Chaudhary Rashid, who hails from Deoband, says no one can win the Saharanpur seat with the help of one vote bank
 congress ke saath jo bhi vot he wo ek samudaay kaa he
 But Dalits, Muslims and Jats are uniting with the alliance
 isliye aankado ke lihaaj se basapa ke fajalurrahman hi bijepi ko kadi takkar de sakate hai
 Mayawati has also said this clearly in her speech
 darasal dalit, jat or muslim maton kii ekajutata se basapa ummidavaar haji fajalurrahman kii raah aasaan banati he, lekin teenon samudaay ko jodne kii badi chunauti he
 Mayawati's election rally has sent a big message to unite the Muslim and Dalit voters
 bhim army ke chandrashekhar ke poster jis tarah basapa kii raily main najar aae hai, usase saaf he ki bhim army bhi kahin na kahi gathbandhan ke paksh main khadi najar aa rahi he
 At the same time, BJP is again trying to see its future in the confusion of Muslims
 bijepi kaa puraa jor dhruvikaran par he
 The party is looking at the dream of feeding the lotus once again with the Muslims divided as fixed
 lekin devband kii raily ke baad musalamaanon main ekajute hone kii lagaataar koshishen tej ho gai hai, jisase imran kii raah kaaton bhari najar aa rahi he

 ' abhi do hafte pehle bijepi ne jab tripura, meghalaya or nagaland main piem modi or amit shah ke netritv main kile fatah kiye to unke sahyogi dal unki tarif karte nahin thak rahe thea
 But as soon as the BJP lost its face in the 3 Lok Sabha bypolls of UP and Bihar and on the other hand, after the TDP left from the NDA, the allies who used to read ballads before PM Modi and BJP President Amit Shah, are now Questioning leadership
 chiraag paswan bole- 2019 main dikkat aegikendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ke bete or lokjanshkti party ke saansad chiraag paswan ne kaha ki upachunaav ke nattejey 2019 ke chunaav ke liye achche sanket nahin hai, yah khatre kii ghanti he
 There is still time for decisions to be taken only after consulting the allies of the alliance
 unhone aage kaha ki bijepi ko apane sahyogiyon ke saath milakar inupachunaavon par chintanakarna chahie
 Those who are angry colleagues should overcome their heartburn, otherwise 2019 will be a problem
 akali dal ke saansad kaa bayanuske baad akali dal ke saansad naresh gujral ne kaha ki ye baat dhyaan main rakhni chahie kii 2019 main kisi ek kii dal kii purna bahumat kii sarkaar nahin banegi
 Gujral said that he agrees with the demand for TDP to give special status to Andhra Pradesh
 unhone ye bhi kaha, 'main pichley teen saal se kah rahaa hum ki ye endie pichley endie jaisaa kaam nahin kar rahaa he
 Atal ji had something else
 ''sabhi saathi dalon kaa sammaan kare bijepi'naresh gujral ne aage kaha, 'meraa maananaa he, samay aa gaya he ki saathi dalon ko ahmiyat di jaae
 The BJP should respect all the partner parties, be it small or big, and listen to them because everyone has their own political compulsions and needs
 agar aisa nahin hoga to 2019 main endie ko iskaa nuksaan hoga
 He did not stop here, he said that some BJP leaders sometimes divert the government from the agenda by bringing many other issues like Ram temple, sometimes cow slaughter
 BJP ke saath 2019 kaa chunaav nahin ladegi shivasenashivsena pehle hi ghoshnaa kar chuki he ki wo 2019 kaa chunaav endie ke saath nahin ladegi
 In such a situation till yesterday, TDP, which was the partner party of NDA, has brought a no confidence motion against the Modi government
 tidipi ke avishvaas prastaav par congress, tiemasi, ediemke, left, samaajawaadee party saath khadi hai
 If sources are to be believed, the Shiv Sena will not support the tdp's no-confidence motion but will walkout from the House during voting
 bijepi ke lieupachunaav haaranaor tidipi kaa endie se baahar janaa, 2019 ke aam chunaav kii drushti se bilkul thik nahin he
 This is such a situation that if we do not control now, the path of 2019 will be weakened

 isliye hamane is role ke liye bal or dadhi badhaane kaa faisla kiya tha

 Kabir Singh, a remake of the film Arjun Reddy, is going to release on June 21
 do din ke bharat daure par aa rahe hai chini raashtrapatiisse pehle donon diggaj china ke vuhaan main mili thepradhanmantri narendra modi 11 va 12 oktober ko tamilnadu ke tateey shahar mahabalipuram main yojit hone vaale duusare dwipaksheeya anaupchaarik shikhar sammelan ke liye unesco kii vishwa dharohar sthal par chini raashtrapati shi jinping kii mejabani karenge
 The two leaders have met 14 times so far, but informal conversations were held only once
 isse pehle donon diggajon ke bich pichley saal chini shahar vuhaan main mulaakaat hui thi
 First, Prime Minister Modi will visit Arjun Penance with his special guest
 eesai ke diarector ne bataaya ki yahaan ek vishaal shilapattee par kai akritiyaan bani hui hai jinke bare main manyata he ki ye tasviren ganga ko dharti par laane kii dastaan bataati hai
 At the same time, it is also believed that Arjuna had done austere penance by standing on one leg on this to get the animal husbandry from Lord Shiva
 arjuna penence ke baad pradhanmantri modi chini raashtrapati shi jinping ko pancharath par le jaaenge
 There are five incomplete chariots here, which are believed to belong to the Pandavas
 iske baad pradhanmantri modi apane chini mehmaan ko tat mandir main le jaaenge jo samudr ke kinare bana he
 a grand cultural program will also be held near this temple, in which the Chinese President will be familiar with the dance music tradition of South India
 mahabalipuram se china kaa he 17 sau saal purananathamahabalipuram bengal kii khadi ke kinare basaaek shahar he jo pracheen samay main vyapaar kaa bada hub tha or purvi deshon ke saath yahaan se sidhe taur par vyapaar hota tha
 About 1700 years ago, when the Pallava dynasty ruled the region, and Narasimha II, the king of the Pallava dynasty, also sent his messengers to China to promote trade relations with China
 isi ke paas based kanchipuram kaa bhi china ke saath purana sambandh he
 Why this meeting is important? This meeting is also important because for the first time after the removal of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, the two leaders will be with each other
 khaskar tab jab taaja-taaja pakistani pradhanmantri imran khan china jaakar jinping ke aage apana dukhada ro aae hai
 The special thing is that on October 8, a spokesman of China's Foreign Ministry on Kashmir said that there is no change in China's stance on Kashmir
 bharat-pakistan dwipaksheeya mudde milakar sulajhaayen, lekin ek din baad yani 9 oktober ko chini raashtrapati shi jinping ne imran khan se baatcheet main kah diya ki kashmir ko yuan prastaavon ke mutabik suljhaayaa jaae
 Obviously, when Prime Minister Modi and Xi Jinping meet in the delightful atmosphere of Mahabalipuram, then this move of China will definitely remain in the mind of PM Modi
 vaise to videsh mantralay ne is par turant hi jawaab de diya tha ki bharat ke aantarik maamalon se china dur hi rahe to behatar he
 Rajkumar Ashok Sajjanhar said that Prime Minister Modi has shaken Pakistani nahi by calling China who plays such a mahabalipuram from Pakistan
 isse duniya main ye sandesh jayega ki bhale hi pakistan par china kii saraparasti ho, lekin bharat ko naaraaz karne kii jurrat wo nahin kar saktaa
 Yes, it is possible that there may be some thing going on from business to border dispute
 darasal, china se bharat kaa sambandh pyaar kaa kam, nafrat kaa zyada rahaa he
 The border dispute stands as an eternal question, but on economic issues the two countries can stand together
 china ko america de chukaa he chetavaneechin in dinon america se trade waar main apana haath jhulasa chukaa he
 US President Trump has said openly that China will have to bow down
 aise main china bharat se vyapaarik sambandhon ko naa sirf majboot karne kaa prayaas karegaa balki wo chahega ki america se vyapaar main aa rahi giravat kii bharpai wo bharat se kar le
 PM Modi understands this business compulsion of China

 Prior to the three-match ODI series starting on Sunday, Estwick said that youngsters from the team like Shimron Hetmeyer and Nicholas Pooran should learn from the opposing captain Kohli
 unhone shuukravaar ko kaha, ‘team main hetmer, puuran or shai hope jaise khilaadiyon ke hone se yah hamaare liye romaanchak samay he
 We have got young batsmen who are making better progress

 Success will not be achieved without hard work

 Once they start working and go through this process, they will have a chance
 ’coach rody estavik ne kaha ki is daure par khilaadiyon ne shandaar khel dikhaaya he, lekin cricket main aap kabhi aaraam nahin kar sakate hai
 He said, 'they have been fantastic on this tour, we cannot accept their mistake
 unhone vastav main kadi mehnat kii he
 It will now appear in the result
 'estavik ne mana, 'agar aap tii-20 main hetmer ke khel ko dekhen to yah romaanchak tha
 Now we are moving to a longer format
 log is tathy ko bhul jate hai ki bahut kam umr main, unke paas pehle se hi chaar vanade shatak hai
 He is obviously very talented
 cricket main aap aaraam nahin kar sakate
 Estwick said the West Indies did well in terms of narrowing the gap with India in the T20 series
 unhone kaha, ‘ham tii-20 main apane pradarshan se khush hai
 There was a big difference when these two teams played the three-match T20 International series in the West Indies
 ham khush hai ki us antar ko kam (tii-20 main) kar paae or ummid he ki 50 over ke praaroop main bhi aisa hi hoga

 On the third day, Modi woke up to an hour of yoga and pranayam in his second floor residence of Gujarat Bhavan at 6 in the morning
 unhone apane mantriyon ko 100 din ke lakshya tay karne kaa nirdesh diya
 Of the 10 priorities he has set for the NDA government, at least three are about bureaucracy
 unhone saaf kar diya he ki ve apni sarkaar main jabardast safai karne vaale hai
 Their agenda is to instill confidence in the bureaucracy, give them freedom to work and encourage them to think out of the box
 modi ne sanket de diya he ki jaise kaam shuru kiya he vaise hi karte rahenge
 In the official list of members of his Council of Ministers released on 27 May, he also added a line with the names of his departments, "all important policy related topics

 According to Chandrasekhar, along with this, a strong system of decentralization and delegation of rights will be adopted so that a minister is not burdened with all the work

 input:bhashaa In Bihar, the political bogey on the word 'low' is not taking its name
 araspi netaa or kendriya mantri upendra kushvaha ne up mukhyamantri susheel modi kaa jawaab dete hue kaha he ki yadi mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke kehane kaa arth 'neech' nahin he, tab to priyanka gandhi ke bayaan kaa arth nikaalte samay pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi galat the
 Actually, when asked questions on Union Minister Kushwaha on India Today's SOS Bihar platform, he talked about keeping the level of conversation high
 nitish ke is bayaan par kushvaha bifer gaye or ise apni pratishtha se jod liya
 Kushwaha retorted on Nitish's statement and asked if his DNA report came up in the Bihar elections, questions were raised or not? The Deputy Chief Minister gave a clarified tweet by seeing the ruling JDU-BJP alliance in the political stance of Kushwaha
 Had also done, "nitish Kumar has never used the word 'lowly' about any leader
 main us kaarykram main maujuud tha
 Some people are deliberately trying to become martyrs
 parantu unhen safalataa nahin milegi
 "now, while replying to Sushil Modi, Kushwaha retweeted his tweet," If in your interpretation Nitish ji does not mean 'low'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Then according to you the Prime Minister was wrong even while interpreting the statement of Mrs
 Priyanka Gandhi
 
 
 ?"yadi aapaki vyakhya main nitish ji ke kehane kaa arth 'neech' nahin he
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 tab to aapke anusaar shrimati priyanka gandhi ji ke bayaan kaa arth nikaalte samay bhi pradhanmantri ji hi galat the

 Modi pulled Priyanka's statement from lowly politics to the lower caste and a tornado arose that the Congress was again disturbed by giving clarification

 After the revelations of Aaj Tak's sting operation, Arvind Kejriwal took to the road demanding the arrest of Union Minister Salman Khurshid
 kejariwal or unke saath khadey logon ko police ne hiraasatamen lekar bavana main banaai asthai jail main band kar diya
 On Friday night, Kejriwal and his associates will have to be jailed
 sutron kii maane to shanivaar subah kejariwal or unke saathiyon ke reeha hone kii ummid he
 But Kejriwal has made it clear that he will continue the movement until he is arrested by Salman Khurshid
 dilli main virodh pradarshan ke dauraan arvind kejariwal ko hiraasat main le liya gaya he
 Manish Sisodia, Gopal Rai and a large number of other members of the IOC have also been detained along with them heading towards the Prime Minister's residence
 kejariwal ne kaha, giraftaar hon khurshid dampatservind kejariwal ne kaha he ki trust main gadabadi karne ke maamle main kendriya kanoon mantri salmaan khurshid or louis khurshid ko giraftaar kiya janaa chahie
 Kejriwal said that till they will not be allowed to meet the Prime Minister, the sit-in demonstration will continue
 pradhanmantri ne nahin diya milane kaa vaktis masale par baat karne ke liye arvind kejariwal pradhanmantri manmohan singh se mulaakaat karnaa chaahate hai, jabaki pradhanmantri ne unhen milane kaa vakt dene se saaf manaa kar diya he
 Arvind Kejriwal, who has stepped into politics by raising a movement against corruption, is besieging the Prime Minister's residence
 salmaan khurshid ke trust par ajtak ke khulaasene arvind kejariwal ko siyaasi sangharsh kaa ek bada mudda de diya he
 Arvind Kejriwal is seeking to resign Salman Khurshid, seeking to resign Salman Khurshid
 is ahm masale par deshavaasiyon kii nigahen tiki hui hai
 Whatever the issue may be, Arvind Kejriwal catches it first
 jab maamla kisi bhrashtachar se judaa ho, to deree ho hi nahin sakati
 Salman Khurshid is now on the target of Arvind Kejriwal, the issue of 'operation Dhritarashtra'
 ajtak ke oparation dhritarashtra main jab khulaasa hua ki salmaan khurshid kii sanstha jakir hossain memorial trust main bade paimaane par farjivada he, to arvind kejariwal ne ek sur main hi khurshid ke istife kii maang shuru kar di
 The first demand for deception with disabilities, then pressure and even then the matter did not happen, the decision to picket-display was made
 viklangon ke saath dhokhe ko mudda banaakar kejariwal pradhanmantri awaas ke baahar dharna dene vaale hai
 The most important thing is that Kejriwal has also set up an army of physically weak people to increase his strength
 ye sab log bhi dharna main kejariwal ke saath rahenge
 Robert Vadra came under attack on political personalities and now Salman Khurshid
 arvind kejariwal jaanate hai ki siyasat main sabase jaruri he mashhoor hona or mashhoor hone ke liye mashhoor hastiyon ko nishaanaa bananaa aasaan rasta he
 Arvind Kejriwal's attack is still on full target to raise the issue
 ab sawaal yah he ki kya ve apni maangon ko lekar dharna de paaenge
 Kejriwal also knows very well that he has laddoos in both hands on this matter
 agar de paae to dharna hit, agar hataa die gaye to mudda hit
 In Madhya Pradesh, the Congress is unable to overcome the 'shivraj Phobia' and the party is looking for a mantra through which it can reduce its impact
 yahi kaaran he ki party ne bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) kii takat bane mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kii naakaamiyon ko hathiyaar banane kaa man bana liya he
 Although there may be more than a year for the upcoming assembly elections in the state, the Congress has already started preparations so that the previous losses from the BJP can be calculated
 rajdhani bhopal main teen din tak chali party kii pratinidhi baithak main agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav kii chaaya saaf najar ai
 The Congress was involved in these meetings of responsible officials of all levels to know the ground reality of the remote area of the state
 sabhi ne party ke bheetar chal rahi gutbaji va samarpit kaaryakarta kii upeksha kaa maamla puri takat se uthaaya
 Some activists even suggested announcing the name of the chief ministerial candidate before the election so that there would be no doubt among the general public about the future Chief Minister of Congress
 aisa hone se congress ko laabh hoga
 In this meeting, the state in-charge and national general secretary of the party, B
 ke
 Hariprasad was present and told the workers clearly that he should count the failures of the state government and especially Shivraj among the common people
 hari prasad kaa kahana he ki rajya main araajaktaa kaa maahaul he, bhrashtachar, aparaadh, mahila atyaachaar ke maamalon main pradesh awwal hai
 Those who oppose power are politically murdered and their voices are suppressed
 is pradesh kii pahchaan 'murder pradesh' kii banati ja rahi he
 Factionalism in the party once again appeared in this meeting
 baithak main hari prasad ke alaava digvijay singh hi pahunche, vahiin digar pramukh netaaon ne duuri banaai rakhi
 Hari Prasad clearly denies the factionalism in the party
 congress kii sarkaar ke saath shivaraj kii naakaamiyon ko ujagar karne ke liye bani ranneeti par bhaajapa chutki leti he
 Party spokesperson Brajesh Lunavat says the Congress has been troubled by the continuous defeat and that is why it resorts to personal allegations
 pehle vidhansabha chunaav, phir upachunaav va anusuchit jati bahul nagareey nikaay chunaav main congress kaa supada saaf hua he
 All this has happened due to public welfare schemes of Shivraj government
 congress dwaara mukhyamantri shivaraj par hamalaa karne kii ranneeti banaae jane se rajya kii raajnneeti ke taapmaana main oochaal aane kii sambhaavnaaon kaa nakaara nahin ja saktaa
 The reason for this is clear because Shivraj is the winning face of BJP and Congress is dominated by 'shivraj Phobia'
 darasal sushant singh rajput ne aane vaali film 'detective byomakesh bakshi' main jasoos kii bhoomika nibhaai he
 During the promotion of Lehaza film 'detective Byomkesh Bakshi', when the media asked which star Sushant would like to spy on Bollywood, he immediately asked Aamir Khan to spy on him
 or jab unase puchha gaya ki aamir kii jasusi kyon tab sushant ne kaha, 'agar jasusi karne kaa mauka mili yaa karne kii khwaahish karun to main aamir khan kii jasusi karnaa chaahunga kyonki main ye jaananaa chahta hum ki unhone itane saalon se itani acchhee filmein kaise kin
 Even today, he remains so excited about his films, how he chooses the story or theme of his films, how he does such a good job, etc
 ' It cannot be denied that Aamir has chosen a different path over the years and has done well and successful films compared to other stars
 filmon kii marketing or prachaar main bhi trend set kiya he
 It would be fair to say that Aamir has focused on quality and not on quality and hence he is called Mr
 Perfectionist of Bollywood
 aamir khan kii yahi adaa or filmein karne ke andaaz kii vajah se sushant singh rajput jaise aaj ke yuva kalakaar unase prerana lete hai or unki jasusi kar kuch seekhney kii khwaahish rakhte hai

 The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which has been under criticism for not accepting the demand for the removal of Delhi's Law Minister Somnath Bharti, has defended him in the midnight raids in an area of south Delhi
 'aap' ne kaha he ki bharti ke khilaaf kisi karrwai se pehle nyaayik jaanch ke nateezon kaa intjaar karnaa chahie
 However, the AAP political affairs committee headed by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal objected to the language used by Bharti against BJP leader Arun Jaitley and lawyer Harish Salve and said that he should desist from using such language from now on
 
 bharti ko dilli sarkaar main mantri pad se barkhaast karne kii jor pakadati maang ke bich piesi kii yah baithak hui

 Party leader Yogendra Yadav told reporters here that the party has not found any evidence against Bharti on the three charges
 pehla to ye ki unhone aisa koi kaam nahin kiya jo ek mantri ko nahin karnaa chahie tha
 Initial investigations conducted by the party have found that he neither misbehaved nor attacked the women of Uganda
 yah bhi nahin paaya gaya ki unhone kisi tarah kii naslbhedi tippanee kii
 The senior leader of the AAP said that if judicial inquiry found Bharti guilty of any mistake, appropriate action would be taken against her
 isse pehle, bharti ke khilaaf apana rukh kadaa karte hue, congress ke ek pratinidhimandal ne aaj uparajyapal najeeb jang se mulaakaat kii or unase mantri ke khilaaf tatkaal karrwai ke liye police ko nirdesh dene ko kaha
 Congress party leader Arvinder Singh Lovely, who is supporting the AAP government from outside, said that Delhi Police is not conducting a thorough investigation in the case
 hamane is maamle main kanoon ke anusaar kaam karne ke liye dilli police ko nirdesh dene kii uparajyapal se maang kii
 Law ministers are not above the law, whatever legal action is necessary, it should be

 Police has arrested 5 miscreants who kidnapped the child in this case
 police kii giraft main aaye badmaashon se bachche ke apharan ke dauraan liye 8 lakh rupee, phiroti kii rakam ko bhi baraamad kiya
 The child's family rescued him by paying a ransom on 15 February, while informing the police on 17 February
 iske baad police ne gheraabandi karke paanch badmaashon ko giraftaar kar aath lakh rupye nagad va teen tamanchey va do chaaku baraamad kar liye hai

 However, the baby slippers were thrown outside the security gate of the colony while the kidnapper was passing
 parivaar dwaara report darj karne ke baad kavinagar police bachche ke aparankartaaon ko pakadaney ke liye juty hui thi
 But the police was not aware of the conversation between the miscreants and the victim's family
 bina police ko bataae peedit parivaar de aayaa tha phiroti kii rakambata den, pandrah farvari ko peedit parivaar phiroti kii rakam dekar bachche ko chhudaa laayaa tha, lekin isaki jaankaree police ko nahin di
 Two days later, the police was informed about the entire case

 SP City Shlok Kumar said that the victim's family had received calls from two places for ransom money
 ek phone pakistan ke number se aayaa tha jo ki phek number tha, jabaki duusari kuch kol in aparankartaaon dwaara kii gai

 The next day, at the flyover near Akshardham cut in Delhi, the child's mother took a bag full of rupees and kept it on the roadside
 badmaashon ne agle din bachche ko sahi salaamat ghar ke paas chhod diya tha
 According to the police, the miscreants had done some debt to the crooks to emerge from the debt and financial crisis

 Pakistan has extended the period of completion of investigation of Mumbai attack for the third time
 jaanch team ko teen din kaa vakt or diya gaya he
 However, what is to come out in the investigation report is more or less clear
 pakistan sajeesh ke aaropon se inkaar kar saktaa he
 Pakistan's Interior Security Minister Rehman Malik has once again opened his mouth on the Mumbai attack and said that now Pakistan is ready
 paak kii report bhi taiyaar he or do se teen din ke andar mumbai par hue hamale kii report sabake saamne hogi
 Where were the attackers and where was the plot planned, it will be in front of everyone
 darasal malik abhi dhindhora peet rahe hai
 Pakistanis are telling the world through the media how much valuable reports they are preparing
 report taiyaar karne main kitna pasinaa baha rahe hai lekin ye nahin bataa rahe ki itani mehnat karke pakistan purana kooda parosane kii taiyaari main he
 Pakistan is preparing to reverse as before and it has been looking for reasons for reversal for the last two weeks
 rahamaan jo nahin kah rahe wo pakistan kii media bataa rahi he
 According to what Pakistan news channel Dawn has revealed, Pakistan will do what the world already knows
 do hafte tak jaanch kaa nateeja he mumbai par hue hamale se koi sambandh hone se inkaar
 According to the channel, according to the preliminary report of Pakistan, the plot to attack Mumbai was not planned in Pakistan but the report also did not say where it was made
 report main kaha gaya he ki ab tak hui jaanch main mumbai hamale main pakistani haath hone kaa koi suraag nahin mila he or jaanch cameti ye report shanivaar tak sarkaar ko saunp degi
 This is the situation when a living terrorist is in the hands of India
 
 The Pakistani government initially avoided telling the terrorist as its own, but when a father's voice came from inside Pakistan saying that Kasab was his son, the Pak government was shocked
 pakistan ke pradhanmantri yusuf raja gilaani se lekar raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari tak dam bharne lage ki aatankwaadiyon ko apane yahaan sajaa denge or kadi sajaa denge lekin kuch din intjaar kiijie ye saare daawey hawa hone vaale hai
 The report is going to come and Pakistan will not come back

 The major revelation in this attack is that 3 suicide bombers wanted to enter the France National Stadium in Paris, but failing to do so, they blew themselves with gunpowder

 uttar pradesh kii kairana loksabhaa or nurpur vidhansabha seat par vipakshi ekta ke aage bijepi post hoti dikh rahi he
 Both these seats in the state were with the BJP, but despite the unprecedented pairing of Modi at the center and Yogi in the state, these seats seem to be coming out of the party's hands
 agar aisa hua to 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad ye party ko laga doosraa bada jhatka hoga kyonki isse pehle bijepi phulpur or gorakhpur jaisi ahm seat bhi sapa-basapa ke sanyukt ummidavaar ke haathon harkar ganvaa chuki he
 The Mahagathbandhan Havikairana Lok Sabha seat in Kairana is also seen getting a deep blow from the BJP
 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi ummidavaar ke taur par hukum singh ne yahaan se kareeb 3 lakh maton se jeet hasil kii thi
 But this seat became vacant after his death last year
 bijepi ne sahanubhuti ke naam par vot hasil karne ke liye hukum singh kii beti mriganka singh ko maidan main utaara
 While RLD nominated Tabassum Hasan, who was supported by SP, BSP and Congress
 kairana main ek baar phir jat-muslim ekajute dikhe hai
 After the Muzaffarnagar riots, there was a gap between the two
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki areldi pramukh choudhary ajit singh ko loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav main karaari maat khaani padi thi
 But once again, Ajit Singh seems to be successful in regaining his lost support base by joining the grand alliance once again
 bijepi ke saare formule mahagathbandhan ke aage fail hote dikh rahe hai
 Whereas in the 2014 Lok Sabha and 2017 assembly elections, the BJP eliminated the opposition here
 nurpur kaa kila bhi darakabijepi kaa majboot garh nurpur darakta dikh rahaa he
 The SP is seen opening an account on this seat
 sapa ummidavaar naimul hasan bijepi ummidavaar avani singh se kaaphi aage chal rahe hai
 This could prove to be a deep setback for Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 bataa den ki ye seat bijepi ke lokentre singh chouhan ke ek durghatana main nidhan kii vajah se khaali hui thi
 Avni Singh is the wife of Lokendra Chauhan, whom BJP has nominated as its candidate
 vahiin sapa ne pichley chunaav main duusare number par rahe naimul hasan par ek baar phir bharosa kiya he
 The RLD, Congress and BSP are supporting him
 nurpur vidhansabha seat parisemen ke baad 2012 main vajood main ai, tab se isapar bijepi kaa kabja he
 Both times Lokendra Singh Chauhan won the election as BJP candidate from this seat
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ke lokentre singh ne sapa ke naimul hasan ko kareeb 10 hajaar maton se maat di thi
 BJP got 79 thousand 172 votes while SP got 66 thousand 436 and BSP got 45 thousand 903 votes
 2012 se pehle ye seat syohara vidhansabha seat ke naam se jaani jaati thi
 Sayohara seat has been occupied by BJP
 1991 se lekar ab tak saat baar vidhansabha chunaav hue
 Out of these, BJP won 5 times
 jabaki 2 baar basapa jeetne main safal rahi
 After the removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, the anger of Pakistan is clearly visible
 pakistan ne bharat ke saath dwipaksheeya sambandh kam karne or bhartiya rajdoot ko nishkashit karne kaa elaan kiya he
 Indian leaders have also commented on Pakistan's move
 congress netaa salmaan khurshid ne kaha ki is faisle se pakistan ko hi nuksaan hoga
 In the statement, Khurshid said, what will be the benefit to Pakistan
 ye adoordarshee faisle hai
 This will harm Pakistan
 lekin vah koi pratikatmak faisla lenaa chaahate hai, to yah unka faisla he
 Congress' Salman Khurshid on Pakistan's decision to downgrade bilateral relations with India & suspend trade: what benefit will they get from it? These are short-sighted decisions
 It's only they who'll suffer losses
