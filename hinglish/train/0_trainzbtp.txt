 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main in donon dalon ke bich 189 siton par sidhi takkar (vijeta or upavijeta in do dalon main se hi rahe) hui thi jinamein bhaajapa ne 165 par jeet hasil kii (dekhen graphics) jabaki congress in siton par duusare number par rahi
 The Congress got just 24 seats
 loksabhaa kii kul siton kaa kareeb 35 fisadi yani 189 main uttar pradesh kii bhaajapa kii jiti hui maatr 6 siten shaamil hai
 The Congress faced a tough defeat in four states - Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh - in direct competition with the BJP
 in rajyon se bhaajapa kii jholii main 83 siten ain jabaki congress ko maatr 3 siten milin
 For this reason, the Congress is also seen working hard in these states
 in chaar rajyon main se teen main disambar main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai or congress ne iske liye puri takat jhonk rakhi he
 In the Gujarat elections too, the Congress left no stone unturned to defeat the BJP, it is a different matter that it did not get the expected success

 Narasimharao says, "where we have a direct fight with Congress, we will get more benefits
 hamaari siten badhengi kyonki vahaan jatvaad, sampradayikta jaise factor zyada kaam nahin karte
 Negative politics of the Congress does not succeed there
 '' mahangaai ke masale par raav kehete hai, ''sirf petrol-dijal kii mahangaai ko nahin dekhnaa chahie
 Overall inflation has not increased
 congress pravaktaa rajeev tyaagi kehete hai, ''jin siton par congress ke saath bhaajapa kaa sidhaa muqabla he, unamem se 80 fisadi main is baar congress aage rahegi kyonki matadaata centre or rajya sarkaron kii nitiyon se pareshaan ho chukaa he
 Farmers and young people have got nothing, both are desperate
 chunaav paardarshee shashan, menifesto par amal, mahangaai or berogari jaise muddon par ladaa jayega
 It is true that the long-held BJP is facing anti-incumbency trends in all the three states going to the assembly elections, but BJP President Amit Shah makes a surprise visit to the electoral states, demanding the account of 70 years of Congress's own governments
 Calculating achievements of bhaajapa maanati he ki loksabhaa chunaav ke sameekaran ekadam alag hote hai
 These three electoral states have 65 Lok Sabha seats, of which the Congress won only 2 seats in 2014
 vidhansabha chunaav main uskaa pradarshan loksabhaa chunaav main uski sambhaavnaaon par asar daal saktaa he
 The result of this is that Congress President Rahul Gandhi has united these states day and night
 congress adhyaksh ne khud ke pradhanmantri ummidavaar hone kii baton par khud hi viraam laga diya he
 Despite this, when Narendra Modi gets down for campaigning, the contest will automatically be Modi vs Rahul
 modi ke prachaar main utarane ke baad fark to padataa he, iskaa namoona gujarat or karnataka main dikh chukaa he
 Challenges of BJP, Congress's challenge In the face-to-face confrontation of the Congress, the challenges for both parties are numerous
 congress mukhya rup se anti inakambency yani sarkaar ke prati janata kii naaraazgi main apni kamyaabi dekh rahi he
 Therefore, in the election campaign of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, they are raising issues like inflation and unemployment by electing against the BJP, which is troubling the public
 bhaajapa teenon rajyon main lambey samay se satta main he or phir jeetna kaaphi mushkil mana ja rahaa he
 Congress seems to have an atmosphere in its favor and party sources are claiming that the party will get 200 Lok Sabha seats comfortably this time
 lekin bhartiya janata party aisa nahin maanati
 The party says that when the comparison is between our five years and their 50 years, our pan will turn heavy

 Narasimha Rao says that Congress will have to suffer losses in states with direct competition
 mahangaai kaa mudda zyada chalane vaala nahin he
 The bjp's biggest strength is Narendra Modi and aggressive campaigning, which seems to be lacking in the Congress leadership
 sidhe mukaable main matadaata sheersh netaaon kii bhi tulana karte hai
 The weakness and limited resources of the organization make the Congress weaker than the BJP
 haalanki 19 saal adhyaksh raheen sonia gandhi kaa tajurba rahul gandhi ke liye upyogi hoga
 She will also go out in publicity and create an atmosphere
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne bhi teenon rajyon ke tufaani daure kar sameekaran saadhane main koi kasar nahin chodi he
 Amit Shah is taking a quick tour of the three electoral states and seeking the account of 70 years from the Congress, counting the achievements of the BJP governments
 unhone teenon rajyon main jeet kaa daawa thoka he
 *** aaj kal to dada ji bhi smartphone se hi news padhakar apadet rahete hai
 People keep chatting with each other for hours
 chating to pehle bhi hoti thi bas unke rup badalte rahe hai
 Earlier, letters were sent across the seven seas through penpal and sometimes in the city, there was a flirtation with wall-writing
 par ab smartphone ne logon kii jindagi main itani gahari paith bana lee he ki raste chalate duniya ke kisi kone main baithe vyakti se log mobile kii screen par phase tu phase baat kar lete hai
 Smartphone's journey: The smartphone's story is just a two-decade journey
 kuch logo kaa maananaa he ki pehla smartphone IMB ne 1993 main hi bana liya tha jiskaa naam IBM siman personal communicator tha
 Very few experts are trying to make a pager and fax machine into this phone, consider it the world's first smartphone
 1996 main laanch hue nokia communicator ko bahut had tak pehla smartphone mana jaataa he
 It had a feature of a quality keypad
 iske baad 2000 main pehali baar soni ne tach screen phone laanch kiya phir ye silsilaa aaj ai-phone6 tak aa pahunchaa hai
 How did it increase? There was a time when after saving a lot of numbers in mobile, people felt relieved that they got discharged from the mess of diary, but this series of luxury was going to stop here
 dhire-dhiregaming bhi phone menshuru ho gai
 The desire of the people also made the camera inbuilt into the phone
 aise-aise phone or smart ho gaya
 The essence of smartness is that there are about 16 lakh applications in Android phones, whose services you can take
 bharat or smartfosgar smartnes par kii koi scale bane to bhartiya grahank sabase smart bataae jaaenge, kyoking desh main smartphone kii maang jis andaaj main bad rahi he vah bharatiyon ke teji sebadhate technological vyavarko darshaati he
 Mobile companies are also launching phones on phones keeping in mind the needs and budget of Indians
 pichley ek hafte menlanch hue smartphonon kii keemtaur functionas bhi es baat kii kahani bayaan karti he
 Future phones are expected to bring more revolutionary changes to the smartphone in featurefuture

 The CAG in its Financial Year 2010-11 Audit Report (civil and Commercial) pulled it up in April by the Chhattisgarh Mineral Development Corporation (CMDC) to accept only one bid for commercial mining of coal from the blocks allocated from the Center
 bhaajapa shasit rajya kii sarkaar dwaara jari bayaan main kaha gaya he ki koyala blaak bhatgaanv-do or bhatgaanv do vistaar kaa aavanton centre sarkaar dwaara siemdisi ko vyavsaayik khanan ke liye kiya gaya tha
 CMDC decided to develop these blocks in a joint venture
 is udhyam main 51 pratishat hissedari siemdisi ne apane paas rakhi he
 The statement said CMDC chose a competitive bidding process to select a 49% stake joint venture partner
 bhatgaanv do or bhatgaanv do vistaar ke liye kramash: paanch or do boliyaan milin
 Of these, two and one bid respectively met the eligibility criteria
 boli lagane vaali companiyon ko prayek ton koyale ke khanan par siemdisi ko shuddh laabh main 51 pratishat hissaa yaa unke dwaara sarkari company ko kii gayi sunishchit bhugtan kii peshkash, main jo bhi adhik ho, use dena tha
 The statement said that it was a matter of selection of a joint venture partner through competitive bidding for the development of coal blocks, not coal block allocation
 bayaan main kaha gaya he ki siemdisi or rajya sarkaar ne is tathy kii jaankaree chhattisgarh ke mahalekhaakaar ko di thi
 Since the AG has no geological expertise of any kind, it could not capture the technical differences of the two blocks and made a hypothetical estimate of the loss
 bayaan main bataaya gaya he ki esemes infrastracchar li
 Both were successful bidders for coal blocks
 usne sanvidhik shulkon kaa bhugtan karne ke baad in pariyojnaon main siemdisi ko kramash: railty ke 460 pratishat or railty ke 108 pratishat ke baraabar bhugtan karne kii peshkash kii
 The Board of Directors of CMDC decided on these proposals and considered that the reason for the reduction in the second project was the geological conditions there because the mining cost is high in those circumstances

 He said that the matter will have to be considered after this incident
 lagata he ghar ke maamle main aam aadmi party ke netaa arvind kejariwal thodaa analki he
 This time they found a new house for rent in the Civil Lines area of delhi, but before shifting it, a new controversy has come up
 arvind kejariwal ne civil lines ilaake main 4 bi flagstaff road par ek makaan kiraaye par liya he, lekin ghar main aane se pehle hi vivaad shuru ho gaya he
 Actually, there is a dispute in the family about the ownership of the house
 is ghar ke malikana haq par daawa kar rahe logon main se shaamil virendra jain kaa kahana he ki makaan vivaadit he or is par court kaa ste laga hua he, jisaki vajah se makaan kejariwal ko nahin diya ja saktaa
 On the other hand, Narendra Jain, younger brother of Virendra Jain, who gave the house to Kejriwal, believes that there is a property dispute between his family, which is going on in the Delhi High Court, but he claims that by law, he wants someone to live this house as a guest
 Can also be given to isse kanoon kaa koi ulanghan nahin hota he
 Significantly, there are five brothers and two sisters in the Jain family
 ye sabhi is makaan par apni hissedari jataa rahe hai
 The special thing is that on July 11, all the families have to go to the mediation center of the High Court
 aise main bade bhai virendra jain makaan kiraaye par diye jane ko adaalat kii avmaananaa bataa rahe hai
 At the same time, the spokesman of the Aam Aadmi Party, Dilip Pandey, says that he is not aware that there is any dispute regarding this house and whatever dispute is between the brothers and the party has nothing to do with it
 
 isse pehle kejariwal mayur vihaar ke makaan main janaa chaahate the, lekin us par vivaad ho gaya tha
 Now Kejriwal will have to decide whether he should go to this house with property dispute or find another house
 peshawar ke army skool main hamale ke baad se pakistan main 182 madrason ko sil kar diya gaya he
 These madrasas are accused of promoting terrorism
 somvaar ko saamne ai media report main iskaa khulaasa kiya gaya he
 These madrasas have been closed in Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as reported by the news agency Association Press of Pakistan (APP) as they were allegedly promoting terrorism and indulging in other suspicious activities
 neshnal ection plan ke tahat karravidesambar 2014 main kuch aatankwaadiyon ne peshawar sthit army skool par hamalaa kar diya tha
 150 people were killed in this attack, most of them children
 uske baad neshnal ection plan banaaya gaya or uske tahat karrwai karte hue in madrason ko sil karne kaa kaam shuru hua
 Bank Account Seal As part of the strategy to curb terrorism, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has so far seized 1 billion (about Rs 100 crore) from 126 accounts

 loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle charan main uttar pradesh kii 8 sansadeey siton par 11 april ko vot daale jaaenge
 These include seats in Saharanpur, Kairana, Muzaffarnagar, Bijnor, Meerut, Baghpat, Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar
 soobe kii ye sabhi aath loksabhaa siten pashchim uttar pradesh kii hai
 The political battle of the first phase is getting confined between BJP vs SP-BSP-RLD alliance
 aise main congress ke liye is daur main khaataa kholane kii badi chunauti he
 The BJP won all these eight seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki, baad main 2018 main kairana loksabhaa seat par hue chunaav main basapa or sapa ke samarthan se areldi ne bijepi se ye seat chin lee thi
 SP-BSP and RLD have joined hands to repeat the same winning formula in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 gathbandhan se darkinar hui congress ab akele chunavi maidan main utari he
 Congress out of eight Lok Sabha seats in the first phase, Congress is in the fray for just 6 seats
 bagpat main jayant choudhary or mujffarnagar seat par choudhary ajit singh ke khilaaf congress ne ummidavaar nahin utaare hai
 In a way, the Congress has given RLD a walkover in both these seats
 is tarah se congress pehle charan main teen chauthai siton par hi chunaav lard rahi he
 The Congress has fielded Imran Masood from Saharanpur seat, former MP from Kairana Harendra Malik, Naseemuddin Siddiqui from Bijnor, Harendra Agarwal, Dolly Sharma from Ghaziabad and Arvind Kumar Singh from Gautam Budh Nagar
 raajnneetik vishleshkon kii maane to in chah loksabhaa siton main se mahaj saharanpur seat he, jahaan congress kuch chunaav ladati hui najar aa rahi he
 But the BSP has fielded a strong and Muslim candidate, Haji Fazlur Rahman
 aise main saharanpur seat par muslim vot basapa or congress ke bich batane kii sambhaavna dikh rahi he
 Similarly, Congress has fielded Nasimuddin Siddiqui on the Bijnor Lok Sabha seat
 jabaki gathbandhan se basapa ke maluk nagar maidan main he
 Like Saharanpur, Bijnor seat is also being speculated to divide Muslim votes
 meerut-hapur loksabhaa seat par congress ne babu banarsi das ke bete harendra agarwal ko utaara he
 The BJP has also re-nominated its two-time sitting MP Rajendra Agarwal again
 jabaki gathbandhan ne haji yaqub kuraishi par daanv lagaaya he
 Earlier, the main reason for the victory of the BJP candidate is believed to be the division of Muslim votes
 is baar akele chunavi maidan main hai, jabaki bijepi or congress ne vaisya samudaay par daanv lagaaya he
 In Ghaziabad, the Congress has fielded Dolly Sharma as a Brahmin candidate
 is seat par kareeb do lakh brahman matadaata hai
 But there are about 27 lakh voters on this seat
 aise main mahaj brahman voton se jeet ke dwaar nahin khulte dikh rahe hai
 Similarly, Congress has fielded Arvind Kumar Singh from Gautam Budh Nagar seat
 jabaki basapa ne satbir gurjar or bijepi se mahesh sharma maidan main he
 In this way a triangular contest is being considered, but for Arvind this area is new
 aise main unhen noida sansadeey seat par apane pahchaan banane kii ek badi dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Interestingly, there are no such seats in the first phase where only Muslim votes can be won
 aise main raajnneetik sameekaran ke lihaaj se denkhe to congress ke muslim ummidavaaron ko apane votbank ke saath-saath duusare maton ko apane saath jodne kii badi chunauti he
 The same, if we look at the SP-BSP-RLD votebank, it is reaching above 50 percent
 aise main gathbandhan agar apane votbank ko sadhakar rakhata he to sabase badi chunauti congress ke liye hogi
 Where did we have the strength to loot our loved ones? ye sher team india par sateek baithta he kyonki team india kii lutiyaa duubone vaale bhi isi team ke hi khilaadi hai
 And due to their poor performance, they remain a burden
 aaie jaanate hai koun-koun se hai wo khilaadi jo bhartiya team par boj ban gaye hai-aap hi bataaie kasoor kya he team india kaa
 Just that it trusted its own people
 bas itnaa ki usne apane ghar main badla lene kii apano se ummid kii thi
 but alas
 afsos ki wo saare ke saare boj ban gaye apni hi team ke kandhon par
 Till date they had lost only once on their pitch
 badi ummiden thim inase
 When he lost 8 consecutive Tests abroad, he was heartbroken along with the fans
 badla lene ko inhone nayab tarika dhund nikaala
 Tit for tat
 bounsi kaa badla terning trek se
 He also spoke big words
 lekin, apane hi gadde main gir pade
 In the spin of the British, they lost their senses as to when to bow with which spinner, they forgot
 chaliye, captaini to chhodie, jab balla thaamne kii baari ai to haath kaise kaanpane lage
 It is said that the uppermost reduces the burden, but the God of cricket is a burden that continues to grow
 isi boj tale bechaare bhagwaan itane dab chuke hai ki 26 pariyon se shatak hi nahin laga
 Let's leave the distance, see only three innings of this series
 or haa, kul jamaa ranon ke saath-saath inke out hone kaa tarika bhi dilachasp he
 After about 15 months, when i got a place at 15, it was felt that Harbhajan Singh would remove all the strings as soon as he got a chance in XI
 karne ko wo shikaayat kar sakate hai ki captain ne gend der se thamai or puri pari main 21 over hi karne ko mili
 But they ask themselves whether they can raise their heads proudly by hunting two bowlers in these 21 overs
 agar jahir khan ko yahi lagata he ki feet hokar maidan main utarana hi unki kabalidat he to aisi kabaliyat unheen ko mubarak
 He gave up 119 runs in 3 innings against England and took just 3 wickets
 arase se form or fitness ke har morche par haar rahe team ke strike gendbaaj kii naakaami in aankadon se kahin badhkar he
 His balls, which take away his runup, his delivery and expectations, are enough to increase the burden on the shoulders of Team India

 Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman met Wing Commander Abhinandan on Saturday afternoon
 is dauraan raksha mantri ne kaha ki samooche raashtra ko unke saahas evam dridhtaa par garv he
 Senior Air Force officers were also present with him during this period
 sutron ke anusaar bhartiya vayusena ke ek medical santhaan main hui mulaakaat ke dauraan abhinandan ne pakistan kii giraft main kareeb 60 ghante rahane ke bare main raksha mantri ko vistaar se jaankaree di
 It may be noted that Abhinandan arrived in India late Friday evening through the attari-wagah border and after about two and a half hours, at about quarter to 12, he reached New Delhi by an Air Force plane
 unke bhartiya seemaa main pravesh karne par yah paaya gaya ki unki daayin aankh ke paas sujan he
 He is currently undergoing medical examination at Air Force Central Medical Establishment (AFCME)
 bataa den ki unhen pakistani adhikariyon ne 27 farvari ko pakad liya tha
 In fact, his mig-21 collapsed during a skirmish with Pakistani fighter jets
 lekin unhone apane vimaan ke girane se pehle pakistani vayusena ke epa - 16 ko maar giraaya tha
 After Abhinandan's medical examination after his return to home, he has now been shifted to the Air Force Hostel
 haalanki abhi tak yah saaf nahin paaya he ki abhinandan kii medical report main kya nikal kar aayaa he
 Indeed, on Friday Pakistan was about to hand over the wing commander Abhinandan to India
 iske liye bharat kii ore se puri taiyaariyaan kii ja chuki thim
 Air force officials, Indian embassy officials and government representatives were ready at all times, but Pakistan's tactics were carried out from noon to night
 pehle pakistan kii ore se hi bataaya gaya tha ki abhinandan ko vah kareeb dopaher main 3 se chaar baje ke bich main reeha kar degaa, magar usne baar-baar deree kii
 There are many reasons behind this
 masalan, vah is ghatana ko lim lite main laana chahta tha
 He wanted the whole world to see this news
 shuukravaarsham ke teen baje ke aas-paas abhinandan ko pakistan ne rawalpindi se lahore pahunchaa diya gaya tha
 But he took so long to bring the Wagah border from Lahore, due to which his evil intentions were also revealed in front of him
 sutron kii maane to abhinandan ko lahore main sthit kisi sena ke chhavnee main roak kar rakhaa gaya tha or pakistan neabhinandan kaa jabarnek video banwaaya
 It is also true that the process of documentation between Pakistan and India was delayed for some time, but this delay was not so much that the return of Abhinandan should take place from noon to night
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke anusaar bhartiya payalat abhinandan ko bharat ko saunpe jane main deree isliye hui kyonki, unase pakistani adhikariyon ne camere par bayaan darj karne ko kaha
 Only after this he was allowed to cross the border and go home
 iske alaava dastavejon se sambandhit mudde bhi deree kii vajah bani
 Sources had said that Pakistan postponed his release time twice
 amritsar ke upayukta shiv dulaar singh dhillon ne bataaya ki bahadur payalat apane desh lautakar khush he
 Asked what Abhinandan told the officials when he returned home, the Deputy Commissioner said that he first smiled and said, 'I am happy to return to my country
 'wagha ataari seemaa par kuch aupchaariktaaon ke baad unhen biguef adhikariyon ko saunp diya gaya
 Later Air Force officers brought the greetings with them
 iske baad wing commander ko ataari seemaa se vayusena ke vaahan main amritsar le jaaya gaya
 During this time, the police of Punjab Police were driving with their vehicle
 iske baad vardhaman ko hawaii maarg se dilli laayaa gaya
 Wing Commander Abhinandan had crossed into the Pakistan border while chasing the Pakistani Air Force fighter plane at around 10 am on 27 February
 pakistan ke epa-16 ko maar giraane ke baad abhinandan kaa vimaan bhi krash ho gaya
 Because of this he had to get off with the help of parachute somehow
 jab vah neeche aae tab unhen ehsaas nahin tha ki vah dushman desh kii dharti par ja pahunche he
 Some people came to him, whom Abhinandan asked where he was
 is par kuch pakistaniyon ne chalbaaji dikhaate hue unase kaha ki aap bharat kii dhanti par hai
 But Abhinandan had some doubts
 iske baad vah bharat mata kii jai ke naare lagaae
 After this, Pakistanis surrounded them again
 abhinandan kisi tarah khud ko bachaane ke liye vahaan se bhaage
 He was later taken into custody by the Pakistani Army
 sena ne unase poochtacha kii, magar abhinandan ne utana hi munh kholaa, jitna unhen bataane kii ijaajat hoti he vayusena main
 After this, he was also served tea and coffee by the Pakistani Army
 uske baad phir imran khan kii ghoshnaa ke baad duniya ko pataa chalaa ki vah mahaj do din ke baad hi vatan waapas ho jaaenge
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while welcoming Abhinandan's return, said in the tweet that 'wing Commander Abhinandan is welcome to your home
 raashtra ko aapke adamya saahas par garv he
 Our armed forces are a source of inspiration for the 130 crore Indians of the country
 ' wing commander abhinandan kii swadesh vaapasi par puure desh kii nigahen wagha border par din bhar lagi rahi
 Not only this, Wing Commander Abhinandan was congratulated by many political leaders including Rahul Gandhi and tweeted on his return
 urisa ke kandhamal main balaatkaar kii shikaar hui nan ne insaaf ke liye ab khulkar apni aawaaj buland kii he
 Accepting the rape incident with him, he has demanded a CBI inquiry into the scandal
 nan ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki uske saath police ke saamne dushkarm hua or police mookadarshak bani rahi
 The nun said to the media for the first time that she did not trust the state police and that the case should be investigated by the CBI

 He said that i had been raped and i do not want to face the torture of Orissa police again
 nan apni vyathaa likhakar laai thi, jise usne padhakar sunaaya
 On August 24, at around 4:30 in the evening, he heard the crowd at the gate of the Divyavasti Pestoral Center

 They then saw that their houses were set on fire
 kareeb saadhe aath baje jangal se lautakar unhone ek bhadra hindu parivaar ke ghar main sharan lee
 The nun recounted his agony, saying, "at around half past one on August 25, the crowd entered the room where i was staying
 bheed ne mere bal pakadakar ghar se baahar khinch liya
 Two of these people were ready to grab my throat and bite me with an ax
 maine dekha ki fadar chilan ko bhi peetate hue baahar nikaala ja rahaa tha"unhone kaha,"bheed main shaamil 40-50 log lathi, kulhadi, lohe kii rod aadi anek hathiyaaron se las the
 People brought both of us on the main road
 iske baad un logon ne janavikas bhawan main aag laga di
 The crowd said that she would set both of us on fire
 ""janavikas bhawan tak pahunchane ke baad un logon ne mujhe bhojanakaksh ko jane vaale baraamde par phenk diya
 The place had broken glass and ashes
 " nan ne vistaar se yah baat bataai ki is jagah par kis tarah se unke saath balaatkaar ko anjaam diya gaya
 The victim alleged that the police lax in registering an FIR against the accused and her statement was not recorded
 nan ne kaha ki mere saath dushkarm hua he or main phir se urisa police kii yatnaa jhelana nahin chaahati
 Significantly, on August 23, at the Jaleshpata Ashram in Kandhamal district of Orissa, unknown assailants killed Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Swami Lakshmanananda Saraswati and his four supporters
 is ghatana ke baad jile main faili sampradayik hinsa main updraviyon ne kai girjagharon ko nishaanaa banaaya or isaayiyon ke ghar phoonk daale
 During this violence, the nun, a victim of rape, appealed to the Supreme Court for justice
 haalanki adaalat ne gat 22 oktober ko is maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha ki philhal is maamle ko sibiai ko saunpane kii jarurat mahasoos nahin ho rahi he
 During the press conference, no one was allowed to answer questions to the victim's nun, but Arch Bishop John Dayal, general secretary of All India Christian Council and member of National Integration Council present there said that we will continue the fight for justice and the matter CBI will file a review petition for investigation
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki rajya main pichley dinon kii hinsa main samudaay vishesh ke nirdosh vyaktion ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya or ab rajya sarkaar abhiyukton ko sajaa dene main dheel barat kar rahi he
 Arch Bishop said that we want the CBI to be investigated for the incidents of violence in the state in 2007 besides the murder of VHP leader and the subsequent communal violence
 jaan dayaal ne kaha ki ham un logon ke khilaaf bhi aapraadhik shikaayat darj karne ja rahe hai jinhone hamaare khilaaf sajeesh karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 However, he alleged that the late Saraswati and her supporters had a hand in the violence in Kandhamal district
 jaan dayaal ne kaha ki urisa police se unka vishwaas uth gaya he or isai samudaay ke hajaaron log aaj bhi sharnaarthi shiviron main hai tathaa apane ghar lautne ko lekar sahame hue hai
 During this, Father Dominic Emmanuel, spokesperson of the Delhi Catholic Church, asked the reason for holding this press conference in the capital of the country that due to the media gathering, our talk will go to more people and the court will think to reconsider its decision

 India has destroyed terrorist camps in pok
 In Indian action, many PAK Army soldiers are also spreading the Pakistan media and army
 The Indian Army has responded to the firing on the border by Pakistan for the last one week
 bhartiya sena ke javaanon dwaara diya gaya ye jawaab itnaa karaara tha ki pakistan main ab hadakamp much gaya he
 Nearly half a dozen Pakistani army personnel have been killed in the retaliation of India, 3 terrorist camps have been destroyed and terrorists have also been killed
 is bich pakistan kii ore se is sach ko chupaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he, jisamen pakistani sena or media bhi shaamil he
 The Pakistan Army has rejected India's claims that there has been devastation in Pakistan on behalf of India, constantly targeting terrorist camps and giving a befitting reply to the Pakistani army soldiers who are under the cover of those terrorists
 bharat kii is karrwai ko pakistan pachaa nahin paa rahaa he, PAK sena ke pravaktaa asif gafoor ravivaar se hi bharat ke khilaaf twit kar rahe hai
 Read this: India broke into pok once again, dozens of terrorists piled up, camps became targets, PAK said
 
 
 asif gafoor kii ore se lagaataar daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki bharat jin aatanki campon ko tabah karne kii baat kar rahaa he vah galat he
 He has written that there were no such camps in pok, not only that, he has again invited foreign media to check
 pakistani sena kaa saath de rahaa mediapakistani sena lagaataar bharat ke khilaaf jhooth failaane main lagi he to vahaan kii media bhi uskaa saath hi de rahi he
 Army Chief Bipin Rawat has said that 5-6 Pakistani army personnel have been killed in India's action
 lekin pakistan media is sach ko chupa rahaa he or lagaataar daawa kar rahaa he ki pakistan ke ection main bharat kii kaaphi tabaahi ho rahi he
 Pakistani media is talking about the killing of many Indian soldiers, which is completely wrong
 The propensity of false claims by senior Indian military leadership especially since Pulwama incident is detrimental to peace in the region
 Such false claims by Indian Army are being made to suit vested domestic interests
 This is against professional military ethos

 a photo of the Naxalite attack in India in 2014 is being described by the Pakistani media on Sunday and is saying that many Indian soldiers have been killed in the action of the Pakistani Army
 haalanki, pakistan ke in daavon kaa soshal media ne hi bhanda phod diya tha
 Read this: Army has blown three camps of Lashkar in pok, 5 PAK soldiers in action, too, that Pakistan has done similar activity before, whether it is about surgical strike or airstrike time
 har baar pakistan ne sach maanane se inkaar kiya he or duniya ko apana hi alag propaganda bechaa he

 During the Delhi Assembly elections, the Aam Aadmi Party had promised to install 10 lakh CCTV cameras in the city of Delhi, but even after three years of coming to power, this promise has not been fulfilled
 haal hi main cabinet ne elaan kiya ki mahila suraksha ke lihaaj se dilli sarkaar ditisi or cluster kii 6350 bason main sisitivi camere lagane ja rahi he
 The project to be set up with the Nirbhaya Fund will cost around Rs 140 crore
 prayek bas main 3-3 camere lagenge
 Former minister Kapil Mishra has raised serious questions on the amount of the project
 unhone twitor par likhaa ki 140 karod rupee ke 6350 camere lagaae ja rahe hai
 a camera costs Rs 2,20,472
 is twit ke saath unhone mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kaa ek tivi intervyuu bhi soshal media par share kiya
 Kejriwal is saying in the video that he will put 2 thousand rupees per month, which will be wi-fi
 iske kharch kii puri gananaa unhone kar lee he
 The journalist asked that the expenditure is very high, on which the CM said that cameras will not be installed on the lines of the Congress party
 unka 90 pratishat paisa bhrashtachar main chalaa jaataa he
 At the same time, senior Congress leader Chatar Singh also questioned Kejriwal that Kejriwal, who talks about honesty, should now tell how much corruption he has done
 kapil mishra ne bataaya sisitivi ghotaladusri taraf bijepi adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne kaha ki 2000 kaa camera do lakh main pad rahaa he, jaahir he bich kaa paisa satyendra jain ke paas jane vaala he

 Their total cost will be Rs 33 thousand crores
 yah kharch kaise nikalegaa? is sandarbh main jab aap pravaktaa saurabh bharadwaj se poocha to unhone kaha ki maamle kii puri jaankaree unhen nahin he
 Apparently, while making election promises, Arvind Kejriwal clearly said that he will get a CCTV camera for Rs 2000 and he has calculated all this
 lekin satta main aate hi yah sisitivi camera 2000 rupee se badhkar do lakh rupee kaise ho gaya
 The answer has not yet been received from the Delhi government

 In Delhi on Monday, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu announced the implementation of the new catering policy in Indian Railways
 rail mantri ne pichley saal apane rail bajet bhaashan main iskaa prastaav rakhaa tha
 Suresh Prabhu said, 'we want to provide good, clean food to the railway passengers
 ham chaahate hai ki chalati gadiyon main unhen swaadisht or paushtik khaanaa supplai kiya ja sake
 'to improve the catering of railways, the Ministry of Railways has several schemes according to which the kitchen of the railways will be modernized
 khaanaa pakaane or khaanaa pahunchane kaa kaam alag-alag kiya jayega
 Slow moving trains may stop cooking
 isaki jagah alag-alag steshnon par khaanaa pakegaa jo trainon main jayega
 The Ministry believes that while the new catering policy will eliminate the arbitrariness of contractors, on the other hand, catering will also be better
 chalati trainon main khaane kii gunvattta ko lekar badhate sawaalon or shikayaton ke baad ab rail mantri nai cataring policy ke zariye yatriyon ko saaf-suthra or behatar paushtik khaanaa muhaiyaa karana chaahate hai
 Now the next challenge will be to implement this new catering system effectively
 tippaniyan The new policy giving IRCTC the responsibility of catering in most trains is being replaced by the seven year old policy
 saal, 2010 main mamata banerjee ke rail mantri rahete hue iarsitisi ko katering kii jimmedaari se mukt kar diya gaya tha
 Prabhu had said in the 2016 budget, 'IRCTC will start handling the catering service in a phased manner
 yah khaanaa pakaane or iske vitaran ko alag alag rakhte hue katering seva sanchalit karegi
 ' railway katering niti-2017 iarsitisi ko khaane kaa menu tay karne or iske liye raashi nirdhaarit karne kaa adhikaar hoga, haalanki iske liye use railway board se paraamarsh lenaa hoga
 In order to achieve the social objective, women will be given a sub quota of 33 per cent in the allocation of stalls under this policy
 mantralay kaa maananaa he ki nai cataring policy se ek ore jahaan thekedaaron kii manamaani khatm hogi to vahiin duusari ore khanpan bhi behatar hoga
 After increasing questions and complaints about the quality of food in moving trains, the Railway Minister now wants to provide clean and better nutritious food to the passengers through the new catering policy
 ab agali chunauti is nai cataring vyavastha ko kargar tareeke se lagu karne kii hogi
 The comments iarsitisi ko adhiktar train main katering kii jimmedaari dene vaali nai niti saat saal puraani niti ke sthaan par laai ja rahi he
 In 2010, IRCTC was relieved of catering responsibility while being the Railway Minister of Mamta Banerjee
 prabhu ne 2016 ke bajet main kaha tha, ‘iarsitisi charanbaddh tareeke se katering seva ko sanbhaalanaa shuru karegi
 It will operate a catering service keeping cooking and its distribution separate
 ’ Railway Catering Policy-2017 IRCTC will have the right to decide the menu of the food and set the amount for the same, though for this it will have to consult the Railway Board
 saamaajik uddeshy ko hasil karne ke makasad se is niti ke tahat stall ke aavanton main mahilaon ko 33 fisadi kaa up kota diya jayega

 BJP President Amit Shah and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Friday announced a consensus on the seat-sharing for the Lok Sabha elections in Delhi, at the same time, the head of the constituent Rashtriya Lok Samata Party and Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha in the NDA in Arwal district of Bihar, RJD
 The leader met Tejashwi Yadav in a closed room
 tejasvi or upendra kushvaha ke bich hui is baithak ne atakalon kaa bazaar garm kar diya ki agar upendra kushvaha kii party ko NDA main sammanjanak siten nahin milti he to vahamhagathbandhanamen shaamil ho sakate hai
 However, even in the grand alliance, the roads are difficult for Upendra Kushwaha
 sutron kii maane to tejasvi yadav ne rashtriya lok samta party ko mahagathbandhan main shaamil hone par 4 loksabhaa siten dene kaa ofer diya he magar upendra kushvaha 6 siton kii maang kar rahe hai
 Apparently, Upendra Kushwaha is currently riding two boats and will sit on the same boat from where he will get the best attention
 isi bich is baat kii bhi jaankaree mili he ki somvaar ko upendra kushvaha kii amit shah se dilli main siton ko lekar main baithak hone vaali he jiske baad hi vah aage koi faisla lenge ki unhen NDA main bane rahanaa he yaa phir mahagathbandhan main shaamil honge
 Upendra Kushwaha had said that it was a mere coincidence that an interesting thing has also come out that Upendra Kushwaha had described his meeting with Tejashwi in Arwal as a mere coincidence but trusted sources of RJD have told that this meeting was decided only when Nitish Kumar left for Delhi 1 day ago to discuss the seat coordination
 NDA main bane rahane ke liye 3 loksabhaa siton se kam par koi samjhauta nahinaj tak se khaas baatcheet karte hue tejasvi yadav ne kaha ki unhone upendra kushvaha ko mahagathbandhan main shaamil hone kaa ofer diya he ab faisla unhen karnaa he

 What is your road map, how will we do it? Not only will Sulkhan Singh work on the agenda of the government, but his comprehensive plan is also ready, but the biggest problem of attitude and behavior of the police in front of us is to fix it
 hamaara kaam hamaare vyavhaar se chup jaataa he
 Which behavior of the police is the most disturbing? Sulkhan Singh - The most complaint is not to file an FIR immediately, work is being started on it
 hamaara sankalp he ye har haal main hoga
 The bureaucracy changes with the government and the police also changes
 kya sulakhan singh ke vakt police apni chhap chhodeygi?sulakhan singh-uttar pradesh kii police profeshnal he
 They are not affected by political swap, our work is chartered in law and works in the same way, those who are affected by political things do not do their work
 hamaari police ko puri chhot di gai he, ham nagarikon ko aashwast karte hai ki ham bina kisi dabaav ke, bina kisi pralobhan ke sakht karrwai karenge

 Still, if someone does, he will have to bear the consequences
 ajtak ke sting par ab tak koi karwaai nahin hui

 What role will the police play on Love Jihad? Moral policing is taking place in the name of women safety

 Law and order remains a big question
 thane gai ladki ko goli maar di jaati he
 10 crore is looted in Varanasi

 What will happen to schemes like Akhilesh government's Dream Project Dial 100 and 1090? There is no talk of change in these two schemes of Sulkhan singh-akhilesh government

 unka peshewar jivan sahakaarita ke madhyam se bhartiya kisaanon ko shashakt banane par samarpit tha
 He took over the dairy in 1949 at the request of Tribhuvan Das Patel, President of Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers Association Limited (KDCMPUL)

 So much milk started to accumulate that their supply started getting difficult
 is samasya ko hal karne ke liye milk procecing plant lagane kaa faisla hua taaki doodh ko sangrakshit kiya ja sake
 Co-operatives started spreading in the neighboring districts of Anand
 aise mila amul namdoctor courian KDCMPUL ko koi saral or aasaan uccharan vaala naam dena chaahate the
 Employees suggested an invaluable name, meaning priceless
 baad main amul naam chunaa gaya
 Kurien was the first person in the world to manufacture powder from buffalo milk
 isse pehle gaay ke doodh se powder kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa tha
 At that time there was no technique to make buffalo milk powder
 is disha main kaam hone laga
 In 1955, the technique of buffalo milk powder developed for the first time in the world
 kaira deyari main oktober 1955 main yah plant lagaaya gaya
 This was a huge success of Amul

 Operation Flood helped farmers associated with the dairy industry to direct their own development, control their resources in their hands
 rashtriya dugdh grid desh ke doodh utpaadakon ko 700 se adhik shaharon or nagaron ke upabhoktaaon se jodta he
 Overwhelmed by the success of Amul, the then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri formed the National Milk Development Board (NDDB) to spread the Amul model to other places and Dr
 Kurien was made the chairman of the board
 andidibi ke adhyaksh ke rup main unhone bharat ko duniya main sabase bada dugdh utpaadak desh banane ke liye ‘oparation flud’ kii aguwai kii or amul ko ghar-ghar main lokapriy banaaya

 khud doodh nahin pite the!courian ke nijee jivan se judi ek rochak or dilachasp baat yah he ki desh main ‘shwet kranti’ laane vaala or ‘milcoman of india’ ke naam se mashhoor yah shaks khud doodh nahin peetaa tha
 He used to say, 'I don't drink milk because i don't like it
 ' bharat sarkaar ne unhen padam vibhushan se sammanit kiya tha
 He was also awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership, the Carnegie Wattler World Peace Prize and the International Person of the Year honor of the US
 amul se jude hai 1
 More than 6 crore milk producers today 1 all over the country
 6 karod se zyada doodh utpaadak amul se jude hue hai
 These milk producers deliver their milk to Amul through 1,85,903 dairy co-operative societies across the country

 rajdhani dilli ke tughluqabad main sant ravidaas mandir giraae jane par raajnneeti tej ho gai he
 Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati had attacked Delhi and the central government by tweeting on this issue on Wednesday morning, now Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has responded to them
 kejariwal ne twit kar likhaa ki dilli main zamin centre ke adheen aati he, aise main mandir giraae jane main hamaari sarkaar kaa koi haath nahin he
 In fact, Mayawati had tweeted in the morning and wrote that Sant Ravidas Temple built in Tughlakabad area has been demolished with the connivance of Central and Delhi Government, we oppose it
 mayawati ji, mandir ke giraae jane se ham sab log behad vyathit hai
 i strongly oppose it
 i am sorry that you along with the Center blame us for this
 dilli main “zamin” centre sarkaar ke adheen aati he
 Our government has no hand in the demolition of this temple
 https: / / t

 iskaa sakht virodh karte hai mujhe dukh he ki aap centre ke saath iske liye hamen doshi maanati hai
 Land in Delhi comes under the central government, our government has no hand in the demolition of this temple
 aapako bataa den ki supreme court ke aadesh ke baad dilli vikaas praadhirakaran (DDA) ne tughluqabad sthit sant ravidaas mandir ko dhaha diya tha
 Due to this there is resentment in the Dalit society
 is naaraazgi kaa asar naa sirf dilli balki punjab main bhi dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 On Wednesday itself, the Punjab bandh was called by the Dalit society in many cities in Punjab, which had the effect in big cities like Jalandhar, Gurdaspur, Hoshiarpur
 kai jagah is ghatana ke virodh main pradarshan bhi hua, jahaan police ko hawaii firing kerani padi
 On this issue, the Bahujan Samaj Party demanded that the central-state government get these temples rebuilt with mutual consent
 sthaneey logon ko maananaa tha ki ye sthal kai varshon purana tha or unki manyata thi
 But where this religious place was, the DDA had made a boundary around it
 ye masalaa pichley kaaphi lambey samay se adaalat main tha
 Amid the ongoing fighting in the Samajwadi Party, UP BJP President Keshav Prasad Maurya has said that the SP has failed to stop the corruption, crime, Gundaraj, illegal occupation of land and crime against women
 isliye janata kaa dhyaan is taraf se hataane ke liye or apane bete akhilesh kii image ko bachaane ke liye mulaayam singh naatak kar rahe hai
 Maurya has questioned Mulayam Singh saying that he knows that Akhilesh is not capable of running the government and he has failed badly
 aise main unako putrmoh tyaag kar akhilesh ko istipha dene ke aadesh mulaayam singh kyon nahin de rahe hai
 He said that Mulayam Singh himself has instructed ministers and legislators of his government many times to improve and not occupy, bully, recover from public platform
 wo khud jaanate hai ki pradesh main kya ho rahaa he
 Even after all this, knowing why he is silent, Maurya said that Akhilesh Yadav should show courage to recommend dissolution of Vidhan Sabha instead of dividing the public and leave the chair
 bhartiya janata party chunaav ke liye taiyaar he
 Gundaraj, crime, increasing atrocities on women are at the height of the state and if the government fails to stop it, then Akhilesh should give up the chair and give the public a chance to decide
 jaipur main hue 10,000 karod ru
 The elder jeweler Navratan Kothari was finally arrested in Indore in connection with the Jalmahal scam
 jaipur ke jila magistrate ne 9 janvari ko giraftaar warrant jari kiya tha
 Indore police arrested him on January 17 after receiving news of Kothari being in the city
 kothaari vahaan jalmahal resorts ke mahaprabandhak rajeev lunkad ke pita vinay lunkad kii antyeshti main shaamil hone gaye the
 Jalmahal Resorts is the company which has been given Rs
3,500 crore by the Rajasthan government for the historic monument Jalmahal, Man Sagar Lake and its surroundings
 kii jameen ko mahaj dhai karod kii salanaa dar se agle 99 saal ke liye bech diya he
 India Today has published several reports highlighting the scam
 is project main mumbai sthit kalpataru samooh ke arbapati mafatraj munot baraabar ke hissedaar hai
 Munot has a close relationship with Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and has been frequenting the events of Gehlot Kothari
 sarkaar ne munot or kothaari ko maan sagar jhil main pani kam karne kaa mauka diya jisase ve prastaavit hotel or vyavsaayik parisar ke liye paryaapt jameen kaa daawa kar saken
 All the concessions were given to these two, going against the terms of the tender
 rajasthan hycourt ne isse pehle kothaari ke giraftaar warrant par roak lagane se inkaar kar diya tha
 In October, the Supreme Court also dismissed an appeal against the arrest warrant
 hycourt ne ek janhit yachika par sunwaayee karte hue jhil, mahal or jameen kii bikri or patte ko radd kar diya tha or rajya sarkaar ko is maamle main vishwasghaat kaa doshi bataaya tha
 Last year too, Rajasthan Police did not take action on the arrest warrant
 indore police ne jab kothaari ko pakadaa to rajasthan police ko indore janaa hi padaa
 And keeping aside the order of the Judicial Magistrate of Jaipur to present Kothari in court on bringing him to Jaipur, the police took him and admitted him directly to the ICU of SMS Hospital, so that he did not have to go to jail

 2014 se hi bagdadi duniya kii najaron se gaayab he

 Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh never fail to surprise us with their cute antics on social media

 In such a situation, it is now suspected that this rumor was probably true deepika ne shuruyaat se hi apni pregnancy kii afvaahon ke bare main baat kii he or inhen jhuthlaayaa he
 However, now the fans are worried about what this comment may mean
 ranvir singh ne pati ke coment ke jawaab main hai baby bhi chillaaya

 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's party Janata Dal is going to contest about 100 seats in United Gujarat and the party has also announced the names of 20 star campaigners for the election campaign, but the shocking thing is that Nitish is in the list of star campaigners Kumar's name is missing
 nitish ke gujarat main chunaav prachaar nahin karne ke faisle par purv upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ne sawaal uthaaya he or poocha he ki jabgujrat main jediu182 main se 100 siton par chunaav ladane ja rahi he to aakhir nitish vahaan chunaav prachaar ke liye kyon nahin ja rahe hai or unhen vahaan jane se kisne roka he?tejasvi ne nitish par tanj kasate hue kaha ki gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main unka naam star prachaarkon kii suchi main nahin he or vah gujarat jane se parhez kar rahe hai magar dilli nagar nigam chunaavon main vah party ke star prachaarak the or dilli jaakar har ward main gum-gum kar jediu ke liye vot maanga tha
 Tejashwi said that in the 2009 Lok Sabha and 2010 Bihar assembly elections, Nitish Kumar had prevented Narendra Modi from campaigning in Bihar and now it seems that Narendra Modi is taking revenge from him in the Gujarat elections
 tejasvi ne kaha ki nitish ne jis-jis andaaj main modi ko apamaanit kiya tha or unke naam par gathbandhan todaa tha ab usee andaaj main vah pradhanmantri modi nitish se badla le rahe hai
 Tejashwi said that Nitish is so helpless in front of Prime Minister Modi that he is not in a position to utter a word
 tejasvi ne kaha ki rajgir main urja mantriyon ke sammelan ko aakhir pal main sthagit kar evam patna uniwarsity shatabdi samaaroh main nitish kii maangon ko thukraa kar modi sarkaar ne unhen pehle hi sthaan dikhaa diya he
 Tejashwi raised the question that Nitish used to say arrogantly that he does not do politics on the basis of anyone, but what is the reason that despite BJP repeatedly showing space, he is sitting silently? After all, what is the helplessness that the BJP is repeatedly humiliating them, yet they are not able to open their mouths? purvottar dilli ke ek rihaishi parisar main chaar logon ne kathith rup se jamkar golibari kii, haalanki isamen koi hataahat nahin hua
 Earlier, the local people stopped the ringleader of a criminal gang from carrying out his "criminal activities" inside the premises

 magar hakeekat kya he
 Now the public came to know

 It was said that the merchant class would benefit
 vyapaar karnaa bahut aasaan hoga
 But what turned out to be the result that GST implicated the traders only
 pareshaan hokar vyapaariyon ne aatmahatya kar lee
 Akhilesh Yadav said that the GST gets amended at the time of elections
 unhone daawa kiya ki bijepi ne upi ke chunaav ke liye hi notebandi kii thi
 People had come under the pretext of demonetisation
 magar, ab janata intjaar kar rahi he ki chunaav kaa din kab aayega
 On the question of bjp's victory in Lok Sabha and UP elections, Akhilesh Yadav said that now the pole is opening
 madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh, rajasthan, main haal main hue chunaav main bijepi kyon haari, kairana main bhi haar gai, jahaan se bijepi ne maarane-peetane kii aag lagaai thi
 Meaning, the public is angry

 Why worry more about it? hindustani jhande ke teen rangon se sajaa manch or kolkata ke asplaned se sate bheed bhare raste ke ek kone par raturaat namoodaar 'seve india' kaa nila hording
 Mamata Banerjee is sitting in the middle of saffron-white-green canopy - wearing white sari with blue edges, which is her identity
 rangon kaa yah sangyojan soch-samajhakar tay kiya gaya he or mahatma gandhi ke satyagrah kii tarj par pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri ne yoddha kaa bana dhaaran kar liya he
 For Maa, Mati and Manush, they are protesting against the alleged attack which Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah have spoken on 'democracy, constitution, institutions of Raj' and the federal structure of India
 us vakt jab loksabhaa chunaav main 100 se bhi kam din rah gaye hai, ladaai ke paale ban chuke hai—yah modi kii aguai vaale endie or sapa-basapa jaise kabhi apratyaashit maane gaye gathbandhan ke bich hogi
 But through a 48-hour long dharna, Mamta has delivered a docile message - she is ready to lead an anti-modi alliance
 darasal, pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri ko is siyaasi garjana or numaaish ke liye sibiai kii ek team ne uksaa diya, jo 3 farvari kii raat kolkata ke police kamisionar rajeev kumaar se 12,000 karod ru
 He was threatened at his residence to inquire into the Saradha chit fund scam
 sibiai ne aarope lagaaya ki rajeev jaanch main madad nahin kar rahe the or unhone sabooton ke saath chhedchhad kii thi
 Mamata had many other ways to save her police commissioner, but the clever politics within her caught the opportunity for a much bigger political opportunity hidden in this crisis
 pehle apni party trinmul congress ke kai sheersh netaaon kii giraftaar ke vakt bhi ve khamoshi rahi thim, par jab sibiai ne unke sabase bharosmand police afasar ko nishaanaa banaaya to unhone apurv javaabi hamalaa bolkar siyaasi sandesh bhi de diya
 Mamta, known for her passion to fight on the road, set protocol and manners on board, boarded her vehicle and drove straight to the commissioner's official residence, then told the CBI officers who came to Rajiv's door to detain him and told him Day sat on a dharna with Rajiv
 lambey vakt se sibiai or kolkata police ke bich kanoonee lucatipi kaa jo khel chalata aa rahaa tha, mamata ne use 'adhinayakawadi centre' or uskaa shikaar bane pashchim bengal ke bich ladaai main badal diya
 To target Di, Mamata chose such an issue, which was taken up by all opposition parties and immediately supported
 yahaan tak ki rahul gandhi or mayawati bhi, jo pradhanmantri kii kursi ke liye unke sabase kareebi pratidwandvi or talabgaar hai, ekajutata dikhaane ke liye aage aae or unke saath 'kandhe se kandhaa milakar' ladgaye kaa vaada kiya
 Tejashwi Yadav of RJD and Kanimoli of DMK came on dharna stage to meet him
 shiv-sena ne bhi—party mukhpatr saamana main—kaha ki sibiai ke chaape kii yojana bhaajapa ne '10 se 15 siten jeetne' kii garaj se banaai
 She also appeared to curse Mamata in a way to 'overturn the center with equal strength'
 yahaan tak ki vipaksh ke mahagathbandhan main koi dilchaspee nahin dikhaane vaale bijedy ke mukhiya or odisha ke mukhyamantri naveen patnayak bhi sibiai kii karrwai se paidaa unki takalif ke sur main sur milaate najar aae, jab unhone kaha ki ''sanstha ke taur par sibiai kii eemaandaaree ko behaal karnaa hoga"
 However, in a precautionary statement later, the BJD said that "it is wrong to associate BJD with some political parties because of this statement"
 aakhirkaar 5 farvari ko jab supreme court ne sibiai ko hidaayat di ki vah rajeev ko giraftaar nahin kar sakati, to mamata ne dharna waapas le liya, haalanki sheersh adaalat ne rajeev ko bhi hidaayat di ki ve 'tatasth' shahar shilong main poochtacha ke liye jaanch agency ke saamne pesh hon
 But by then, Mamata had succeeded in her cause and the motive was to present herself as a leader who could counter the power of modi-shah and garner support from many political parties of the opposition
 ve boleen, ''main tamaam siyaasi partiyon se kahuungi ki bhaajapa ko hataane ke liye saath milakar kaam karen
 "he also said that Modi had planned a 'constitutional coup' against him, simply because he had organized a United India rally on 19 January and had several opposition leaders come to Kolkata to share the stage

 Even in Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP won 71 out of 80 seats, the party is now facing a tough challenge from the SP-BSP alliance
 yahi vajah he ki bengal loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ke liye behad ahm rankshetra ban gaya he
 It won 2 seats and 17 per cent of the votes in the 2014 elections, but in 2016, its vote share came down to 10 per cent mainly due to fighting with the Left parties and the Congress
 mamata ek inch peeche hatane ko taiyaar nahin hai chaahe vah notebandi kaa mudda ho yaa maal or seva kar kaa yaa prastaavit loktantr bachaao rath yatra kaa
 Mamta does not want to give an open exemption to the BJP in the state

 haalanki mamata jor dekar kahati hai ki unhone li se hatakar kuch bhi nahin kiya
 He claimed, "modi came here, Rajnath Singh did six rallies and even he (shah) came here with Swine Kralu
" "bhaajapa netritv mamata ke dharne ke tamaashe se katai maayoos nahin he
 He has missed an opportunity in it
 vah 2019 ke apane abhiyaan ko 'eemaandaar modi' or 'bhrasht gathbandhan' ke bich ladaai ke taur par pesh kar sakati he
 It even gives Modi a chance to play a card of his tried and tested victim, in which he can count on the details of how the then UPA government in various cases between 2008 and 2014 gave him a sense of political revenge and Had troubled Shah

 "officials of the agency claim that several notices were sent to Rajiv, but he did not respond
 isliye unhen aisa kadam uthaane ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 In 2015 and 2017, CBI filed a petition in the Supreme Court accusing the state police of not cooperating in the investigation
 sibiai ne agast 2018 main rajya sarkaar se rajeev samet teen police adhikari saunpane kii anumati bhi maangi, taaki jaanch tej ho sake
 Two of them had received adjournment orders from the High Court till February 13, but Rajiv was not involved in that
 sibiai police jaisi shakti rakhane vaali ek rashtriya agency he
 Its primary jurisdiction is limited to Delhi and Union Territories
 sibiai ko yah takat dilli vishesh police sthapana (dspi) act se mila he

 However, this power also has a screw on Section 6, which states that the powers and jurisdiction of CBI cannot be extended without the consent of the concerned State Government

 Take Sikkim for example
 sibiai ne tatkaaleen mukhyamantri nar bahadur bhandari ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya to rajya ne apni sahmati waapas le lee
 However, in 2010, the Supreme Court, in response to an appeal by the then CPI (M) -led West Bengal government in which the CPI-M wanted to waive the CBI inquiry order of the High Court, said that the High Court could not prosecute cases without the consent of the state governments

 According to the CBI, the state formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by Rajiv to investigate the Saradha chit fund scam in April 2013
 iske ekatra kiye saboot use abhi tak nahin mili
 It included a laptop, five cell phones and some documents, including Saradha Group promoter Sudipta Sen, Rajiv's diary, were not handed over to the CBI
 tiemasi ne daawa kiya ki sibiai uske netaaon ko chunakar nishaanaa bana rahi he, vahiin vah roy or sarama ke bhaajapa main shaamil hone ke baad unki jaanch nahin kar rahi
 On 5 February, Mamta even claimed that she had enough evidence against Sarma and challenged Modi and Shah to show courage to arrest Sarma
 sarama ne aarope kaa khandan karte hue kaha ki ve mahaj gavaah ke taur par jaanch main shaamil hue the or sibiai ne pehle hi unki jaanch kar lee thi
 "my investigation was completed long before i joined the BJP," he says

 In this event, the party's national president Rajnath Singh told the workers in clear terms that they should forget the mutual estrangement and get ready for the election

 In the municipal elections by the BJP, an advertisement was given in the newspapers that Haryana, the first Punjabi chief minister found in 52 years, will not get a chance again in 60 years if he makes a mistake today

 Former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar feels that no doubt should be expressed on the inclusion of members of the IPL Governing Council in the commission of inquiry into the allegations leveled on Chennai Super Kings owner Gurunath Meiyappan
 bisisiai adhyaksh en shrinivasana ne somvaar ko ghoshnaa kii thi ki mayppan maamle kii jaanch teen sadasyeey ayog karegaa, jisamen paanch sadasyeey sanchaalan parishad ke do sadsy bhi shaamil hai
 This raised questions about whether the investigation would be impartial
 tippaniyan Gavaskar, however, has no objection to two members of the IPL Governing Council being part of the investigation
 unhone kaha, ipel sanchaalan parishad ke sadasyon kii eemaandaaree par andeh karnaa sahi nahin he
 It is unfair to doubt his integrity only because he is going to investigate the Gurunath issue
 gavaskar ne enditivi se kaha, bisisiai board ke andruni masalon se jude kai masalon kii jaanch karata he or yadi inamen koi aapatti nahin hoti he to phir is maamle main kaise samasya ho sakati he
 The three-member commission should be respected

 Gavaskar said that the commission should be allowed to deal with whether Meiyappan was the team principal or owner of CSK
 unhone kaha, rajasthan royles ke jin teen khilaadiyon ko giraftaar kiya gaya ve frenchiji ke anubandhit khilaadi the lekin jahaan tak mayppan kaa sawaal he to team prabandhan ne kaha ki vah team se nahin judaa tha
 The commission will investigate this entire matter
 gavaskar ko haalanki ipel sanchaalan parishad ke do sadasyon kaa jaanch kaa hissaa banane par koi aapatti nahin he
 He said, it is not right to doubt the sincerity of the members of the IPL Governing Council
 unki satyanishtha par keval isliye andeh karnaa anuchit he ki vah gurunath masale kii jaanch karne ja rahe hai
 Gavaskar told NDTV, "the BCCI investigates many issues related to internal issues of the board and if there is no objection in them, then how can there be a problem in this matter
" teen sadasyeey ayog kaa sammaan kiya janaa chahie
 On the remarks of another former opener, Arun Lal, who was participating in the program, Gavaskar said, "I want to make it clear that right now i and Ravi are not signed with BCCI
" gavaskar ne kaha ki mayppan siesake kaa team principal yaa maalik tha yaa nahin isse ayog ko nibatane dena chahie
 He said, the three players of Rajasthan Royals who were arrested were the contracted players of the franchise but as far as Meiyappan is concerned, the team management said that he was not involved with the team

 According to Vijay Baba, he could not believe when he got a call from Arvind Kejriwal that he had to inaugurate the maternity home
 vijay baba ke mutabik unke liye ye sab kisi sapane se kam nahin tha
 Arvind Kejriwal said on the occasion that the purpose of his party has been to bring the common man forward from the beginning and hence he did not inaugurate the Maternity Home by rickshawwala

 Damodar Reddy said that after the Center announced the formation of a separate Telangana state on December 9, the state could have been saved from the current situation if Rosaiah had presented a proposal in this regard in the state assembly
 unhone poocha ‘‘aapane (rosaiya ne) vidhansabha main na to koi prastaav pesh kiya or na hi vidhayakon ko vip hi jari kiya

 For the first time in the country, the Bharatiya Janata Party not only challenged the ruling Left government in a state, but also defeated it bitterly and got it out of power
 tripura main bijepi ko mili yah jeet uske liye kai myne rakhti he
 With just two years of hard work, BJP has done what the Congress was trying to do for more than 2 decades
 bijepi kii tripura main yah jeet isliye bhi ahm hai kyonki left party ko shikast dene ke saath hi usne rajya main congress ko apana khaataa kholane kaa mauka bhi nahin diya
 After this performance of BJP, now only the left party government is left in Kerala
 yahaan bhi left ko satta se baahar karne main congress lagaataar koshish main rahati he lekin ab tripura ke nateezon ke baad is rajya main vampanth raajnneeti se mukt karne main kya bijepi ko adhik prabhavi mana ja saktaa he?mamata ne giraaya tha pashchim bengal main left kaa kilisase pehle left ke kile ko bhedane kaa kaam pashchim bengal main mamata banerjee kii trinmul congress ne kiya tha
 In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the UPA, formed by the alliance of TMC and Congress, defeated the Left parties, which won the most seats for the first time in five decades
 haalanki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main congress ko bhi peeche chhod tiemasi sabase aage khadi ho gai
 Read this: Left fort collapsed in Tripura
 
 
 jaane kaise chalaa bijepi kaa jadoolekin vam kile ko dhwast karne kaa asli kaam 2011 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main hua jab rajya main 1977 se lagaataar chali aa rahi vampanthi sarkaar ko mamata banerjee kii trinamul congress ne ukhaad phenkaa
 After this, once again in 2016, Mamta defeated the leftist parties in the state as well as the Congress and BJP and took this left fort in her name
 ab kerala main bijepi banaam left?tripura main bijepi ke haathon shikast kii sambhaavnaaon ke bich sipiai(em) general secretary es sudhakar reddy ne daawa kiya he ki unki party ke liye bijepi number van dushman he
 Reddy argued that in view of the increasing influence of the BJP, the Left parties need to change their strategy
 reddy ke mutabik bijepi ko shikast dene ke liye jaruri he ki vah ek vrihad placeform par shaamil ho
 So, without naming, he indicated that now to fight the BJP, the Left parties should think of an option to join the Congress
 haalanki isse pehle kii left or congress ke gathbandhan kaa kayaas lage reddy ke is bayaan ko bijepi ke khilaaf ladaai main congress se badhati najdiki ke taur par na dekhe jane kii safai de di gai
 This explanation was given by Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan
 vijayan ne kaha ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main congress ke saath kisi gathbandhan kii sambhaavna nahin he
 Significantly, before the Tripura elections, the leftist leader Sitaram Yechury also made the same claim
 yechuri ne kaha tha ki left partiyon kii sabase badi dushman bijepi he or use haraane ke liye congress kaa saath jaruri he
 Yechury's statement was strongly opposed by the leftist leaders of Kerala including Tripura
 donon rajyon main party ikaayiyon kaa daawa tha ki vah apane dam par donon rajyon main left ke kile ko bachaane main safal honge
 The left parties in both states believe that any alliance with the Congress will prove to be a policy wrong for them
 baharhaal tripura ke nateezon se rajya main vamadal ko jawaab mil chukaa he
 If he had tried to form an alliance with the Congress, believing Yechury's talk, the results in the state would have been different
 ab dekhnaa he ki kya kerala main mukhyamantri pinarai vijayan tripura main party ko mili haar se koi sabak lete hai? yaa phir vah bhi kerala main bijepi kaa akele muqabla karne kii jid par bijepi se left banaam rhite kaa aakhri script likhenge

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while implementing the GST across the country from the Central Hall of the Midnight Parliament of June 30, announced that from July 1, all goods in the country from Ganganagar to Itanagar and Leh to Lakshadweep will be sold at one price
 lekin lekin yah sach nahin he
 All cars, including cars, motorcycles in the country cannot be sold at the same price
 aisa isliye ki sabhi rajya main gadiyon kii bikri on road price par kii jaati he or jiesti lagu hone ke baad bhi is vyavastha main koi parivartan nahin hua he
 When you buy a car in any state of the country, including a car, a motorcycle, two prices are given to you at the showroom
 ek eks showrooms or doosraa on road price
 You have to pay the on-road price when you buy a vehicle, so know how the on-road price is determined after the showroom price
 kya he eks factory price?eks factory price vah keemat he jo car dealer factory se car uthaane ke liye manuphaccharer ko detaa he
 That is, the price at which the car company sells the car to its dealer
 kya he eks showrooms price?desh main gadiyon kii bikri gaadi kii keemat (eks factory price) main road tex jodakar kii jaati he
 This road tax falls in the tax list of the state government and is completely excluded from the purview of GST
 road tex jodne ke baad car kii keemat main alag-alag rajyon main 5 se 15 fisadi kaa antar aata he
 Due to this ex-showroom price, the price of the car in the states varies
 iske chalate hi rajasthan or haryana jaise rajyon main sabase sasti daron par gaadiyaan bechi jaati he
 Significantly, road tax is not within the purview of GST
 lihaaja abhi bhi gadiyon kii sailing price prayek rajya main alag-alag he
 In such a situation, the Prime Minister's announcement in Parliament that products will be sold at the same price in every corner of the country, at least it does not apply to the matter of sale of cars

 'mother Mumba, you always hail
 
 
 ' yahi kahata he mumbai nagari kaa har bhakt
 Even if this is not the case, this city is named after the mother Mumba located in Bhuleeshwar in Mumbai
 maa ke bhavy rup ke bich mandir main 6 baar hone vaali aarti kaa gavaah har koi bananaa chahta he
 Pennant flashes in high sky
 mandir karata he maa kii mahima kaa gungan
 a crowd of devotees throngs the true court and devotees make a statement of Mother here
 shwet chandani se dhaval he mata kii kirti
 The place of the Goddess is surrounded by marble walls
 is mandir main aane ke baad maa kii murat ko bhakt bas nihaarte rah jate hai
 The gorgeous form of the mother in the makeup amazes the devotees
 unako apni ore aakarshith karata he or phir barabas hi jhuk jaataa he maa ke aage sir
 The court of Maa Mumba is absolutely unique
 mumbai ke bhuuleshwar main sthit mata mumba kaa ek naam mahamba bhi he
 It is said that there is always a mother's blessing on Mumbai
 mumbai kaa naam hi marathi main 'mumba ai' yani mumba mata ke naam se niklaa he
 Such is the glory of Mumba Devi
 chaahe raja ho yaa rank, devtaa hon yaa manushya, maa sab par apni samaan krupa barsaati hai
 This is the reason why the way of asking for vows in the court of the mother is also very unique
 chaar sau saal puraane is mandir main sikke maa tak pahunchaate hai bhakton kii guhaar
 It seems a bit strange to hear, because here fruits, flowers, coconut, chunri - all these worship materials are offered to the mother, but with this the coins have special significance in this temple
 ek taraf jahaan muraad maangane kaa tarika behad anoothaa he, vahiin purna shringaar main maa amba kaa rup dekhte hi banataa he
 Devotees are drawn to see the statue of the mother adorned with a silver crown painted in Sinduri color and adorned with extremely attractive jewelery

 As grand as the form of Maa Amba, equally important is the Aarti that takes place in the court of the mother
 maa ke is darbar main 6 baar aarti kaa vidhaan he, jisaki shuruyaat subah 6
 It is 30 o'clock
 isse pehle maa kaa bhavy shringaar kar unhen aarti ke liye taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 Although the crowd of devotees throng the temple every day, but on Tuesday there is an influx of people
 shraddhaluon main aisi manyata he ki yahaan maangi gai mannath kabhi adhuri nahin rahati he
 a late mother listens to the wishes of every devotee
 yahi vajah he ki yahaan mumbai se hi nahin, balki desh ke duusare konon se bhi bhakt umadte hai or maa ke aage sheesh jhukaate hai
 Mother Mumba is Kuldevi of Ravana's maternal uncle Marich
 lanka yuddh ke baad jab vahaan se maa kaa visarjan hua, tab mumbai ke samandar main maa ko jagah mili
 It is said that the fishermen living on the sea shore then took mother Mumba out of the sea and established her in Boribandar
 yahi vajah he ki maa kii machuaaron par vishesh krupa rahati he
 Later, the temple of the mother was removed from Boribandar and established in Zaveri Bazaar
 yah mandir apane mul sthaan par 1737 main bana tha
 Exactly where the Victoria Terminus building is today
 baad main angrejon ke shasankaal main mandir ko marine lines-purv kshetra main bazaar ke bich sthapit kiya
 Then there was a big pond on three sides of the temple, which has now been gutted
 is mandir kii bhoomi pandu seth ne daan main di thi
 His family also used to maintain the temple
