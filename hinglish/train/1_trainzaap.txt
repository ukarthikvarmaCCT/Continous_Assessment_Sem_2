 At the same time, Arvind Kejriwal said, "when the Union Minister himself has said about the quality of water that the supply of water in Delhi is of European quality, the BJP is doing politics only

 The NIA argued that after the revelations of Swami Aseemanand arrested in the Mecca Masjid bombing case, he had reviewed the evidence collected by the former investigative agencies ATS and CBI, besides fresh evidence
 enai ne kaha, ‘tathyon or paristhitiyon ke aadhaar par kaaphi soch vichaar ke baad sabhi nau aropiyon ke jamaanat aavednon kaa virodh nahin karne kaa faisla kiya gaya jinhen purv main giraftaar kiya gaya tha or aaropee banaaya gaya tha
 However, the investigating agency said, "NIA will not accept any plea of the accused in the bail petition as it pertains to the charge sheet filed by the earlier investigating agencies
" ’enie ne kaha ki jaanch adhikari ne ucch adhikari ke saamne sabooton ke rup main nae nishkashren or paristhitiyon ko prastut kiya tha taaki yah nirnay kiya ja sake ki adaalat main aropiyon kii jamaanat yachika kaa virodh kiya janaa chahie yaa nahin

 Former Indian captains Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev have said that some of the recommendations of the Lodha committee are quite stringent including one state one vote and a three-year break for administrators
 gavaskar or kapil se pehle purv captain ravi shastri bhi yahi pratikriya de chuke hai jinhone vivaadaaspad muddon ko sulajhane ke liye lodha samiti or bisisiai ke bich baatcheet kii vakaalat kii thi
 Both these stalwarts believe that the bcci's structure for functioning and control is different and hence all the recommendations of the committee may not be beneficial for it
 gavaskar ne kaha, ‘jo teen bhadrajan samiti main shaamil the or siforishein deen
 i fully respect him
 mujhe lagata he ki ek rajya ek vot un sanghon ke liye kuch kadaa he jo board ke sansthaapak sadsy hai
 If you go to England, you will see that not all counties play in the English County Championship
 australia kii pratham shrenee championships (shefield shield) main bhi sabhi rajya nahin khelte
 So playing Ranji Trophy in each state will reduce the level of cricket and we will not get help at the international level
 ’ During the first cricket Test between India and New Zealand here, when fellow commentator Sanjay Manjrekar sought to see the recommendations of the Lodha Committee, Gavaskar said, "at the moment it has been done that where teams are playing at junior level, if you If you are doing well then you are being sent to the next level
 jaise ki chhattisgarh ne junior str par acha kiya or phir use pramot kiya gaya or yahi kaam karne kaa tarika he
 You cannot give direct entry to the states in the Ranji Trophy
 ’ Kapil also said that he considers some of the recommendations to be logical but some are quite strict
 unhone kaha, ‘jin kuch chizon ke bare main pataa chalaa main unase kaaphi khush hum
 The age limit has been set for all
 chayankarta banane ke liye mere paas ek saal bachaa he kyonki isamen 60 baras kaha gaya he
 But i do not understand that Maharashtra has only one vote
 kaise mumbai jaise sthaan ko teen saal baad vot kaa mauka milegaa jisane cricket ke liye itnaa kuch kiya he
 ' vishwa cap jeetne vaale pehle bhartiya captain ne kaha, ‘maansikta khuli rakhane kii jarurat he

 hamen khel ko samay se aage le janaa hoga or phir yah behatar hoga
 If you are adamant about ideas, then it will not help anyone
 unhen baithkar charchaa kerani hogi ki cricket ke liye sarvshereshth kya he
 Kapil said, 'I think some recommendations are quite stringent

 mujhe lagata he ki logon ko dhary rakhana chahie or dekhnaa chahie ki khel ke liye sarvshereshth kya he
 ' kaarykaal or brake ke sandarbh main gavaskar ne kaha ki cricket kii tarah prashasnic dhaanche main bhi yuva or anubhav ke mishran kii jarurat hoti he

 From what i have read about the recommendations in the newspapers, i think you also face situations where you Want people who have been a part of the organization for a long time

 You cannot become president in three years
 aap adhyaksh hai kyonki kuch kaarykaal aapane upaadhyaksh ke rup main bitaye hai

 Gavaskar said, 'three of the Bhadrajans were involved in the committee and gave recommendations
 main unka puraa sammaan karata hum
 i think one state one vote is somewhat stringent for unions who are founding members of the board
 agar aap england jaaoge to dekhoge ki sabhi county english county championships main nahin khelti

 According to officials, the next morning, Rao made large-scale transfers
 unamem asthana ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke maamle kii jaanch karne vaale adhikari jaise dspi eke bassi, diaiji em ke sinha, sanyukt nideshak eke sharma bhi shaamil the
 Alok Verma on Wednesday took over his responsibility and canceled all the transfers made by Rao, an official said on condition of anonymity
 isse pehle supreme court nealok verma ko sibiai nideshak kii shaktiyon se vanchit kar avkaash par bhejne kaa centre sarkaar kaa aadesh radd kar diya tha
 The court, however, made it clear on Verma that he would refrain from taking any major policy decision until the High Powered Committee, which selected the CBI chief after reinstatement, considered the issue of taking away his powers
 verma kaa sibiai nideshak ke taur par do varsh kaa kaarykaal 31 janvari ko samaapt ho rahaa he
 However, the sword of denying Verma the powers and rights still hangs on his head
 sheersh adaalat ne kaha he ki sibiai pramukh kaa chayan karne vaali ucchadhikaar praapt chayan samiti ab bhi verma se jude maamle par vichaar kar sakati he, kyonki sivisi unke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke aaropon kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The selection committee has been asked to call a meeting within a week
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki kanoon main antarim nilamban yaa sibiai nideshak ko hataane ke sambandh main koi praavdhaan nahin he
 The apex court made it clear that any such decision can be taken only after obtaining the consent of the selection consent

 The bench said in its judgment that we consider it appropriate to direct that CBI Director Verma will not take any major policy decision and refrain from doing so until the committee is allowed to take such action or decision on his reinstatement
 yah faisla pradhan nyaayadhish ne likhaa, lekin chunki aaj vah upasthit nahin the isliye nyaayamurti kaul ne yah nirnay sunaaya
 Along with this, the court in its judgment also asked the High Powered Committee consisting of Prime Minister, Chief Justice and Leader of Opposition (leader of the largest opposition party in Lok Sabha) to meet within a week
 ucchadhikaar praapt chayan samiti ke faisle ke aadhaar par verma ko 19 janvari 2017 ko do saal ke liye sibiai nideshak ke pad par niyukt kiya gaya tha

 Right now she was thinking about these questions that Mita, who worked with her, told her that someone has written something upside down on a social website
 mita ne jaise hi us bevesite ko kholaa to wo bhi apane bare main pard kar hairaan rah gai
 Because what was written about him, after reading it, the ground under his feet slipped
 ab sarita ko samaj main aa gaya ki kisi ne uske saath bahut hi bhadda mazaaq kiya he or charitra par keechad uchhaala he
 Now he understood why the people in his office were not talking to him properly and why neither the customers buying the product were picking up the phone
 sarita ko kuch bhi samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha ki uske saath itnaa ganda mazaaq karne vaala shaks koun he
 And what enmity is there with his Sarita, whose revenge he is taking by defaming her
 apane sawaalon kaa koi jawaab miltaa naa dekh usne apane pati ko phone lagaaya or sara kissa apane pati ko sunaaya
 After listening to all this, Sarita's husband asked her to lodge a police complaint about this
 or ab maamla police tak pahunch chukaa tha
 hr's senior officer could not even see the eye in shame
 company ke mulajim use lagaataar shaq bhari nigahon se dekh rahe the
 He himself could not understand what and how all this was happening
 And then the police started their investigation
 lekin uske paas mulazim tak pahunchane kaa koi suraag nahin tha
 Therefore, the investigation of the case was handed over to the Mumbai Cyber cell
 police ko maamle kii tafteesh karte hue ye to maaloom ho gaya tha ki ho naa ho ye kaam offis ke hi kisi shaks kaa he
 So she started investigating messages written about Sarita on the website
 or jald hi uske haath ek kamyaabi lagi
 The police had received the IP address of the computer composing the message
 fouran hi police kii ek team us ghar kii taraf ravaanaa ho gai
 But when she reached that house, she was also surprised
 kyonki ghar main rakhe computer kaa maalik koi or nahin balki sarita ke company kii siio thi
 When the police questioned the CEO in this matter, at first he denied having any information about the Im case
 lekin jab police ne usase kadai se poochtacha kii to tut gai or apni gunaah kubul kar liya
 This woman CEO told the police that Sarita had made a lot of progress in the company in a short time
 or use ye baat pasand nahin thi
 She wanted Sarita to be infamous in the office along with the company's owners and customers in some way
 taaki use naukari se nikaal diya jaae
 And that's why he hatched this conspiracy to discredit Sarita
 ek company kii siio apni hi maatahat se jalakar aisi ghinauni sajeesh rachegi ye shaayad kisi ne nahi sochaa tha
 Well, the victim woman also came to know that he was the CEO of her company, who was the CEO of a disgusting conspiracy to defame her, but she withdrew her complaint as a woman

 The crown of Shiv Sena chief will be decorated with thorns full of thorns, will face many challenges
 vah aaj shaam shivaji park main mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lenge
 Before taking over the throne of power, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had said that there are many spikes in the chief minister's chair
 isse saaf jaahir he ki uddhav thakare ke sir mukhyamantri kaa taj kaanton bharaa he
 Uddhav may be going to form a government with congress-ncp by breaking ties with BJP for the chair, but the challenges are not less
 aise main sawaal he ki uddhav thakare jise keelon vaali kursi bataa rahe hai, us par kitni der tak tik paaenge?sahyogi dalon ke saath saamanjasyshivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ke saamne sabase badi chunauti apane sahyogi congress or ensipi ke saath saamanjasy banaakar chalane kii hogi
 Shiv sena-congress-ncp All three parties have their own ideology and political agenda
 teenon partiyaan vichaardhaara or samskruti ke maamle main ekadusre se bilkul alag hai
 The post-election coalition track record has not been very good
 isiilie bijepi se lekar raajnneetik pandit tak uddhav thakare sarkaar ko dur kaa safar tay karte nahin dekh rahe hai
 However, Shiv Sena leaders are saying that this alliance is not made for five years but for 25 to 30 years
 hindutv chhavi ko barkaar rakhanashivsena shuru se hi kattar hindutv kii chhavi ko lekar aage chali he
 Uddhav Thackeray also demanded the Bharat Ratna for Savarkar
 itnaa hi nahin ayodhya main ram mandir andolan main unhone bad chadhakar hissaa liya tha
 Shiv Sena considers Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to be the model of his politics
 aise main sawaal he ki shivasena ne satta ke liye congress or ensipi jaise dalon ke saath haath milaayaa he
 In such a situation, the BJP is constantly raising the question that Shiv Sena has compromised Hindutva politics
 haalanki uddhav thakare ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki hamaari hindutv kii vichaardhaar kaayam rahegi
 Now we have to see how much they remain intact on this
 centre se kis tarah baithaayenge talmelaudhav thakare ne mukhyamantri pad ke liye bijepi se 25 saal purana naata todaa he
 The BJP government under the leadership of Narendra Modi is at the center
 uddhav thakare ne bijepi ko lekar jis tarah se tevar akhriyaar kar rakhaa he, aise main centre ke saath talmail baitaane kii badi chunauti hogi
 Apart from this, there is a strong opposition like BJP in front of Shiv Sena, which will also not be easy for Uddhav
 kshatrap varchasv kaayam rakhane kii chunautimaharashtra main kai aise kshetra hai, jahaan shivasena or ensipi ekadusre ke dhur-virdohi ke taur par sthapit hai
 In such a situation, any one party has to strengthen its hold in those areas only by harming the other
 is baar ke vidhansabha chunaav main 57 siton par shivasena or ensipi kaa sidhaa muqabla tha
 NCP chief Sharad Pawar is well aware that a large part of the votes polled by his party were anti-incumbent votes
 isamen bhi kuch hissaa shivasena ke virodh ke kaaran ensipi kii jholii main gira tha
 Trouble from farmers to these issues, the revolution is going to sit on the Chief Minister's chair for the next five years, but this time there are many challenges
 sabase pehali chunauti to hogi maratha yuvaaon ko rojgaar dena
 The problem of unemployment in the state has to be dealt with
 sarkaar ko rajya main aarthik susti se bhi jujhna hoga
 Apart from this, the biggest challenge will be to work hard to create trust among the farmers

 Earlier, Delhi government spokesperson Nagendra Sharma tweeted that the delegation of employees met the Chief Minister and committed to provide full support to the Delhi government
 mukhya sachiv ne lagaaya tha marpet kaa aaropagauratlab he ki sarkari karmchaaree sanyukt forum ke ek sadsy deepak bharadwaj ne kaha, 'sarkaar kaa daawa galat he or kejariwal ke maafee maangane tak ve log keval likhit madhyam se hi mantriyon se baatcheet jari rakhenge

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne 4 oktober ko vidhansabha kaa seshan bulaayaa he, jisamen services ko lekar bill pesh hona he yani 15 hajaar guest teachers kii bhartee kaa maamla he
 Accusing politics of people's suffering, BJP MLA Om Prakash Sharma alleged that the government has got used to making every news sensational and politics on people's suffering
 jis mudde ko lekar vidhansabha kaa seshan bulaayaa gaya he wo vidhansabha ke adhikaar kshetra main nahin aata he
 He said that the issues which are under jurisdiction are not called sessions
 bijepi ke mutabik niyam ye he ki dilli main kisi bhi shikshak kii bhartee dilli sabordinate sarvice salection board (dsasabi) ke jariye hoti he, lekinsarkaarakah rahi he ki ham kar lenge
 BJP MLA Om Prakash Sharma alleged that it is an attempt to show through the session that we have passed the bill, but the central government and the BJP are obstructing it
 darasal niyam ke mutabik dsasabi jab bhartee nikaalegi tab in guest teachers kii process ke jariye bhartee ho sakati he
 In which Delhi government can give relaxation in the age of guest teachers and also increase their VAT during the interview, so that more and more people can get jobs
 lekin jo ho hi nahin saktaa sarkaar ne usaparavidhansabhaka seshan bulaayaa he to phir sarkaar bataae ki pehle paas hue 15 bill kaa kya hua or ab phir ek nayaa bill
 Let us tell you that Om Prakash Sharma is the same MLA, who was suspended for two sessions by Assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goyal after he used abusive speech inside the Assembly against the party's MLA Alka Lamba

 According to Sushil Modi, there were constant talks with Kushwaha
 kushvaha kabhi nitish ke khasmkhas hote the, par matbhedon ke chalate do saal pehle kushvaha ne nitish se rishta tod liya tha lekin ab sabhi dalon ne kushvaha vot par apni nazren tikaa lee hai

 ” pradhan kehete hai ki chintan or hema adaalat main ek-duusare ke saath muskaraa kar abhivadan kiya karte the

 Here a woman is neither superior nor superior to a man, but just like a man, there is a person, a human being with all its advantages and disadvantages
 jivan ko manachaahe dhang se jeene kii lalak stri ke bheetar bhi utani hi he, jitani purush main
 Then why duality in vision / behavior? Women of stories like Hari Bindi, Meera Nachi and sixty year old women want to live in accordance with personal thinking and aspirations by defying the fixed boundaries of society
 sthapit vyavastha ne yadi jivan ke chote-chote sukh bhi stri se chhine hai, to vah bhi rudhibaddh samaaj main daraaren daal apane liye ek nijee spes talash hi legi
 Mridula has done a psychological analysis of the dialectical conditions between the rightful consciousness of the man and the aspirations of the woman in the romantic stories by delving deeper into the feminine mind in rhyme and vitrina
 stri kii aantariktaaon, chaahanaaon or gopan dard kaa pareekshan karatin ve pati dwaara patni ke man or sharir par adhikaar jataakar 'istemaal' karne kii pravriti par chot karti hai

 patni sampurna samarpan main prem kaa pratidaan chaahati he, par pati apane mood ke hisaab se patni ke deh-man kaa manachaahe dhang se istemaal karata he
 The resentment of defeat or the celebration of victory, reaction and experimentation are on the female body
 yahaan daanpaty sambandh aapasi samaj or atmiyata par aadhaarit na rahakar ek vyavsaay ban gaya he, jahaan napha-nuksaan muaavja maani rakhata he, prem main samaan bhagidaari nahin

 In Mandu's journey, the guide narrates the story of seven closets, in which Mahadev's name falls into the pit and the title of six satis to avoid the stigma of society due to the six kumaris not getting married

 People worship the six chambers and the pool of water as sacred
 saatvin kothri ko pattharon se paat diya jaataa he or saatvin kumari 'kulata' kahalaai jaati he
 The seventh Mahadeva chooses life by running away with a shepherd by name
