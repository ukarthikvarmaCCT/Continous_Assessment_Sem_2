 Although jantar-mantar is famous for a few more things, but nowadays it remains a place of protest
 jab bhi jantar-mantar par jaaen, koi na koi apni maang ko lekar dharne par baitha hua najar aata he
 Since the fasting at Jantar Mantar of Anna Hazare, almost every day people are seen sitting at Jantar Mantar
 anna hajaare ke andolan ne jantar-mantar kii jameen ko ek nai pahchaan di he
 This movement has created a trust among the people
 ho saktaa he anna hajaare jis mudde ko lekar andolan kar rahe the usamen puri tarah safal na hue hon, lekin unke saath jude logon ko is andolan ne ek nai raah dikhaai he
 We can take the example of Arvind Kejriwal
 arvind ne apana andolan jantar-mantar par shuru kiya tha or is andolan ke sahare vah dilli ke mukhyamantri bane
 One such big movement was seen at Jantar Mantar on Monday
 pune se aae kareeb 100 se bhi zyada chaatr jantar-mantar par dharna dete hue najar aae
 These students of FTII (film and Television Institute, Pune) have been angry for some days over the appointment of their chairman Gajendra Chauhan
 yah chaatr apane FTII ke campus pune pradarshan kar rahe the, lekin jab sarkaar ne unki baat nahin suni to yah chaatr jantar-mantar par dharne par baith gaye
 With the banners and flags in their hands, the agitating students were seen shouting slogans against Gajendra Chauhan and the government
 is dharne ko raajnneetik rang bhi diya gaya
 Leaders of many big parties from JD (U) to Congress reached the dharna and expressed their support
 isamen koi buraai nahin ki rajaneta dharne par pahunchen
 Often political pressure forces the government to change its decision
 
 
 lekin kabhi-kabhi sarkaar ke liye bhi aisa mauka mil jaataa he, jab vah aise andolan ko raajnneeti se prerit bataakar patali gali se nikal jaati he
 However, the media took this movement seriously
 chaatro se pehle media vaale hi jantar-mantar pahunch gaye the
 At Jantar Mantar, it was not a movement but many demonstrations were going on on Monday
 apatitiai ke chaatr dharne par baithe the vahiin unke aasapaas hi kuch log haathon main jhande lekar khadey the, jinamein likhaa tha "nyaay ,adhikaar, azaadi kii ladaai main utho, jaago or tut pado 
 
 
 Walk to Parliament to provide justice to the victims
 " yah virodh tha hisar ke bhagana gaanv se aae kuch daliton kaa
 He alleged that 250 Dalit families have been ostracized by Khap panchayat in Bhagana village, which is wrong
 yah log chaar saal se nyaay ke liye dar-dar bhatak rahe hai, lekin koi asar nahin
 Only the voice of these people was heard in this fight for freedom and rights
 yah ladaai na media ko jagaane main kaamyaab hui thi na hi koi netaa is andolan main kuuda
 The comments sirf itnaa hi nahin aasapaas or bhi kai dharne najar aa rahe the
 LIC Financial Services Executives ranging from some employees of All India Radio to Jantar Mantar were also sitting on dharna at Jantar Mantar for their permanent jobs and some demands
 ek rank or ek pension ko lekar 51 din se kuch purv sainik bhi jantar-mantar par baithe hue hai
 On seeing the camera, people were shouting loudly and trying to get the media attention
 kahin na kahin in logon ko ahsaas tha ki media kii madad se unki baat sarkaar tak pahunch sakati he, lekin media ke camere sirf FTII ke chaatro ke peeche hi bhaag rahe the
 Do such movements really have any future? 
 
 jahaan logon kii baat sarkaar ke paas pahunchane ke liye kai saal lag jate hai ? yah log to jantar-mantar kii jameen par apni jang jari rakhe hai, lekin yah jang na to media ke jameer ko jagaa rahi he na hi netaaon kii niyat ko
 The Anna Hazare movement has given a new identity to the land of jantar-mantar
 is andolan ne logon main ek bharosa kaayam kiya he
 It may be that Anna Hazare has not been completely successful in the issue he was agitating with, but this movement has shown a new path to the people associated with him
 ham arvind kejariwal kaa udhaaharan le sakate hai
 Arvind started his movement at Jantar Mantar and with the help of this movement he became the Chief Minister of Delhi
 aisa hi ek bada andolan jantar-mantar par somvaar ko dekhne ko mila
 Over 100 students from Pune were seen staging a protest at Jantar Mantar
 FTII (film evam televijan institute, pune) ke yah chaatr apane chairman gajendra chouhan kii niyukti ko lekar kuch din se naaraaz chal rahe hai
 These students were performing at their FTII campus Pune, but when the government did not listen to them, these students sat on a dharna at jantar-mantar
 haathon main binar or jhande lekar andolankaaree chaatr gajendra chouhan or sarkaar ke khilaaf narebaaji karte hue najar aae
 This strike was also given a political color
 jad (you) se lekar congress tak kai badi partiyon ke netaa is dharne main pahunche or apana samarthan jaahir kiya
 There is nothing wrong in that politicians arrive on strike
 bahut baar raajnneetik dabaav hi sarkaar ko apane nirnay badalane par majaboor kar detaa he
 
 
 But sometimes there is such an opportunity for the government, when it comes out of the thin lane by describing such movement as politically motivated
 haalanki media ne is andolan ko gambhirtha se liya
 Before the students, the media had reached Jantar Mantar
 jantar-mantar par somvaar ko yah ek andolan nahin balki kai pradarshan chal rahe the
 FTTI students were sitting on a dharna while some people were standing around them with flags in their hands, which said, "get up, wake up and get broken in the fight for justice, rights, freedom
" 
 
 peediton ko nyaay dilaane hetu sansad chalo
 "this protest was against some Dalits from Bhagana village in Hisar
 unka aarope tha ki bhagana gaanv main khap panchayat dwaara 250 dalit pariwaron ko bahishkrut kar diya gaya he, jo ki galat he
 These people have been wandering from justice to justice for four years, but to no effect
 aazaadee or adhikaar kii is ladaai main sirf in logon kii aawaaj sunai de rahi thi
 This fight was neither successful in awakening the media nor any leader jumped into this movement
 tippaniyan Not only this, many more dharnas were seen around
 aal india radio ke kuch karmchaariyon se lekar ke elisi financiel services ikjicutive bhi jantar mantar par apni sthai naukari or kuch maangon ko lekar dharne par baithe hue the
 Some ex-servicemen have also been sitting at Jantar Mantar for 51 days for a rank and a pension
 camera dekhte hi log jor-jor se chilla rahe the or media kaa dhyaan apni taraf khinchne kii koshish kar rahe the
 Somewhere these people realized that with the help of the media, their talk could reach the government, but the media cameras were only running after the students of FTII
 kya sach main aise andolanon kaa koi bhavishya he
 
 
 Where does it take many years for people to reach the government? These people are continuing their war on the land of Jantar Mantar, but this war is neither awakening the conscience of the media nor the destiny of the leaders

 The BJP lost the by-election to Gurdaspur Lok Sabha seat in Punjab
 gurudaspur kii haar ne modi magic ke naam par jeet kaa khwab dekhne waalon kii bhi neend uda di he
 The by-elections are to be held in Phulpur Lok Sabha seat of Gorakhpur and deputy CM Keshav Maurya, called the fort of BJP
 yogi kii pehali agniparikshaw in donon siton ko apane paas rakhane kii chunauti he
 While the opposition is fully prepared to siege them
 aise main ab dekhnaa hoga ki yogi or keshav kis tarah se vipaksh kii ranneeti ko bhedakar apane-apane garh ko barkaraar rakhte hai?darasal gorakhpur or phulpur ke ganit ko agar dekha-parkhaa jaae to donon sansadeey kshetron main badi dilachasp ladaai rahi he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, where BJP got more than the total votes of all opposition parties in these seats
 par ab vah rang feekaa padane laga he
 That is why it is a big challenge for the BJP to maintain its dominance in both the seats
 keshav apana garh bachaane kii kavayad mengurudaspur kii haar cedipti CM keshav marybhi sachet ho gaye hai
 This is the reason that before the announcement of Election Commission, Keshav Maurya is busy strengthening his stronghold, so that he can retain the victory of Phulpur seat
 isi kadi main unhone bispi ko tagada jhatka diya he
 On Sunday, three former BSP mlas joined BJP
 inamen niraj maury, guru prasad maury or deepak patel ke naam shaamil hai
 While Deepak Patel was MLA from Allahabad's Karchana seat, Guru Prasad Maurya was MLA from Phaphamau
 elahabaad se chaar baar kii jila panchayat adhyaksh rah chukin kesari devi bhi bijepi main shaamil hui hai
 Apart from this, Neeraj Maurya, who was MLA from Jalalabad assembly seat of Shahjahanpur twice, has also joined BJP
 nehru kii seat rahi phulpurfulpur loksabhaa seat kii agar baat karen, to yah congress kii paramparaagat seat rahi he
 Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of the country, has been contesting from Phulpur Lok Sabha seat and elected from this seat thrice to reach the Lok Sabha
 bijepi kaa pehali baar khulaa tha khataabijepi pehali baar 2014 main modi lahar main phulpur loksabhaa seat par jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 Keshav Maurya became an MP by winning the same seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, but had to resign after becoming deputy CM of UP
 chaar baar espi jithibataa den phulpur seat par espi kaa bhi majboot janaadhar he
 This is the reason that from 1996 to 2004, the Samajwadi Party candidate has been winning continuously
 usase pehle do baar is seat par janata dal vijayi rahaa, jabaki 2009 main bispi ne jeet darj kii thi
 In such a situation, the biggest challenge for the BJP is to retain the Phulpur seat
 phulpur kaa jatiy samikarnphulpur main jaateey sameekaran kaaphi dilachasp he
 This parliamentary constituency has the highest number of Patel voters, whose number is around two and a quarter lakhs

 The process of winning the election on the ticket of Hindu Mahasabha by Mahant Avaidyanath started in 1989, continues to this day
 mahant avaidhyanath gorakhpur se chaar baar saansad rahe, 1970 main nirdaleey, 1989 main hindu mahasabha, or phir 1991 va 1996 main bijepi se loksabhaa sadsy bane
 Yogi Adityanath handled the political legacy of Mahant Avaidyanath in 1998, when Yogi became MP five times, then did not look back
 pichley paanch baar se lagaataar yogi bijepi ke tikat se sansad pahunchate rahen
 Whether it was bsp's social engineering or Akhilesh's socialism, he was never challenged and his winning streak continued
 gorakhpur main vipaksh kaa jeetna aasaan nahimarch 2017 main yogi ke upi ke siem ban jane se gorakhpur loksabhaa seat khaali ho gai he
 In such a situation, to save the fort of BJP in front of Yogi, one has to go through Agniksha
 gorakhpur loksabhaa seat 2014 ke hisaab se kul 10,40,199 mat tha, jinamein se yogi ko 5,39,127 mat hasil hue the, duusari ore espi ko 2,26,344 vot, basapa ko 1,76, 412 or congress ko 45,719 vot mili
 In such a situation, Yogi alone got more votes than these three parties
 is tarah vipaksh ke liye yogi ke durg main send lagaana aasaan nahin hoga

 pichley kai dinon se notebandi ko lekar loksabhaa main chalaa rahe hangaame ke shuukravaar ko tuutane ke asaar ban rahe the
 The ruling party and the opposition once again came face to face
 shuukravaar subah vipakshi partiyon ne gulam nabi aaazaad ke kamare main baithak karke ranneeti banaai ki agar loksabhaa kaa prashnkaal sthagit kar spikar bahes karne ko raji ho jaaenge to vah bahes karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 In this connection, the opposition also met the Lok Sabha speaker
 jaise hi loksabhaa kii kaarywahi shuru hui to satta paksh vipaksh se maang karne laga
 The ruling party said that the Congress should apologize to the country for the deadlock in the House
 jis dhang se unhone sadan nahin chalane diya unhen sadan main maafee maangani chahie
 The second demand of the ruling party is also that under 193, Jitendra Reddy started discussions
 vahiin se charchaa aage shuru hogi
 On which the opposition did not agree and the proceedings of the repeated Lok Sabha were adjourned
 uske baad vipaksh bel main aa gaya or narebaaji karne laga or sadan kii kaarywai sthagit kar di gai
 This is inside, the Congress's strategy behind running the House on Friday is being told that the Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi had prepared his speech about Gandhinotbandi
 is baat kii bhanak sattapaksh ko lagi or unhone vipaksh kii maang nahin maani
 The ruling party felt that if Rahul Gandhi speaks in the house today, then the Congress can create a ruckus
 vahiin sansad ke duusare sadan main mangalvaar tak chhuttiyon ke kaaran rahul ko jawaab dene ke liye ek gep mil jaataa
 In such a situation, Rahul Gandhi would have said his words but the government could not answer his words
 yah sarkaar ke saamne mushkil thi jisaki vajah se sarkaar ne congress kii ranneeti ko fail kar diya
 Because of this, Rahul Gandhi came out of the House and spoke to the media and questioned PM Modi's decision and alleged that demonetisation is a big scam
 jis par vah sadan main aaj bolnaa chaahate the
 But the ruling party did not let him speak
 vah ek-ek cheez jisase logon ko pareshaani ho rahi he saamne laana chaahate the
 It was said by the ruling party that the opposition parties, especially the Congress, do not want to debate, that is why there is a continuous uproar
 sansadeey kaarymantri anand kumaar ne bhi kaha ki ham log hameshaa se charchaa karnaa chaahate hai
 But Congress and opposition parties are running away from the discussion

 co / mdo854wczr The shocking decision by Congress to field Digvijay Singh from bjp's stronghold Bhopal parliamentary seat has certainly made the BJP camp think
 aisi khabaren hai ki party apni ranneeti par phir se kaam kar rahi he or do baar mukhyamantri rahe digvijay singh ke khilaaf koi majboot ummidavaar utaar sakati he
 This candidate can also be Shivraj Singh Chauhan, who himself has been the CM of the state three times
 pichley varsh hue vidhansabha chunaavon main shivaraj singh chouhan ko congress ke haathon haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha lekin tab se unhone khud ko rajya prati samarpit kiya hua he
 He has surrounded the state's Kamal Nath government and Congress on every occasion and has proved himself to be its biggest critic
 shivaraj singh chouhan vidisha loksabhaa seat se 15 saal tak saansad rahe hai
 But after being named Chief Minister, he chose Budhni region which he still represents today
 lekin 2008 main hue maalegaanv dhamaake kii aaropee sadhvi pragna thakur, jinhen baad main court ne bari kar diya tha, ne bhi digvijay singh ke khilaaf chunaav ladane kii ichha jataai he
 Digvijay Singh will contest the Lok Sabha elections from Bhopal, Kamal Nath had given a challenge to the BJP for nearly three decades in the Chambal Bopal Lok Sabha seat
 congress netaa shankar dayaal sharma, jo desh ke raashtrapati bhi rahe ne 1984 main is seat par jeet darj kii thi
 Since 1989, bjp's Sushil Chandra Verma has represented here on three
 1999 main uma bharti yahaan se jeetin lekin madhya pradesh kaa mukhyamantri banane ke baad unhen istipha dena padaa
 Currently Ashok Sanjhar is MP from Bhopal
 congress kii aathvin suchi, digvijay singh or khadge samet diggaj netaaon ke naam, dekhen- puri listdigvijay singh kii entry se pehle shahar ke meyar alok sharma or party ke mahasachiv vidi sharma ko sambhavit ummidavaar ke rup main dekh rahi thi
 By the way, BJP is saying that everything is fine
 party ke pravaktaa rahul kothaari ne congress ke is kadam ko 'gutbaji' qaraar diya
 Kothari told NDTV, 'this has been done so that even if the party loses, no one can challenge the dominance of Kamal Nath
 lekin nijee taur par netaaon ne mana kii kuch chintaa kii baaten to hai
 Of the 8 assembly constituencies located in this Lok Sabha constituency, 3 are with Congress
 bhopal seat: 1989 ke baad 8 chunaav, magar congress ko jeet naseeb nahin, 'sabase kathin raah' par digvijay singhdigvijay singh ne yahaan se chunaav ladane ke liye hami tab bhari jab mukhyamantri kamalnath ne unhen 'sabase kathin seat' se chunaav ladane kii chunauti di
 Chief Minister Kamal Nath had announced Digvijay's candidature
 kamalnath ke bayaan par pratikriya dete hue digvijay ne kaha tha ki wo rajgad se ladanaa chahenge lekin saath hi ye bhi jod diya ki party jaisaa nirdesh degi wo uskaa paalan karenge
 Digvijay has been an MP from Rajgarh 2 times
 bataa den ki sarkaar gathan ke liye bhaajapa ne 30 oktober ko vidhayak dal kii baithak bulaai he, jisamen mukhyamantri pad ke liye ek baar phir se devendra fadanvis (devendra Fadnavis) ke naam par muhar lagegi
 The BJP believes that by the time the Legislature Party meets, talks will be resolved with Shiv Sena about the sharing of posts in the government
 darasal is baar vidhansabha chunaav main pichhali baar kii tulana main bhaajapa kii 17 siten kam ho gayi, shivasena ko bhi saat siton kaa nuksaan sahanaa padaa
 Since then, the Shiv Sena has been aggressive about the sharing of posts on the BJP
 chunaav nattejey aane ke din 24 oktober ko shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne 50-50 formule kii baat uthaakar dhai saal ke liye mukhyamantri pad par shivasena kaa bhi daawa thok diya tha
 While the BJP is refusing to give the Chief Minister's post to the Shiv Sena
 bhaajapa shivasena pramukh ke bete aditya thakare ko zyada se zyada dipti siem (up mukhyamantri) kaa pad dene ko taiyaar he
 Since then, there has been a screw up between the BJP and Shiv Sena to form the government
 jabaki haryana main beete ravivaar ko hi bhaajapa-jananaayak janata party (jajpa) gathbandhan kii sarkaar ban chuki he
 In Haryana too, the results were announced on October 24 itself
 isi se pataa chalata he ki maharashtra main bhaajapa or shivasena ke bich abhi power shering ko lekar baat nahin ban pai he

 a teacher alleged that while he was referring to Kejriwal's speech as a lollipop of promises, a man named Mahesh, who works in Deputy CM Manish Sisodia's office, threatened to see him and also recorded the video
 pradarshnkaree teachers kaa aarope he ki mukhyamantri unase baar-baar jhooth bol rahe hai
 The announcement of increasing the salary of guest teachers and to ensure their jobs is being done well in advance, but no concrete decision has been taken so far
 siem ke stadium se ravaanaa hone ke kuch der baad higuest teachersane dilli sarkaar or arvind kejariwal ke khilaaf naare lagaana shuru kar diya
 Not only this, all the guest teachers took the ring road as soon as they got out of the stadium and blocked the road for about 1 hour
 shikshakon ke hangaame ko kabu main karne ke liye baari police bal tainaat kiya gaya or bheed ko sadak se hataane ke liye water canan tak kaa istemaal karnaa padaa
 However, the police had to struggle hard to remove the guest teachers from the ring road
 dilli main hai kareeb 17 hajaar guest teachersapako bataa den ki dilli main kareeb 17 hajaar guest teachers hai
 Since the formation of the government in 49 days, guest teachers have been accusing the Aam Aadmi Party government of doing politics
 kejariwal sarkaar ne guest teachers ko shant karne kii koshish to kii, lekin sarkaar kaa ye daanv ulataa pad gaya
 However, Arvind Kejriwal has described the uproar at the Chhatrasal Stadium as a conspiracy between the BJP and the Congress
 bhaashan ke dauraan siem arvind kejariwal ne anya rajyon main guest teachers ko milane vaali selary ginate hue bataaya ki odisha main guest teachers ko pehle 5 hajaar rupee maheenaa miltaa tha, teachers ne ek maheene anshan kiya to rajya sarkaar ne selary badhaakar 7500 rupee kar di
 8 thousand rupees a month in UP, 9 thousand rupees in Rajasthan, 10 thousand 200 rupees in Madhya Pradesh, then 18 thousand rupees in Bihar and 21 thousand rupees per month in Haryana, but in Delhi, now every month salary of guest teachers Has been increased to 34 thousand rupees
 kejariwal ne aage kaha ki 'ab guest teachers ko din yaa ghante nahin, balki har maheene ke hisaab se selary di jaaegi or unhen regular teachers kii tarah chhuttiyaan bhi milengi
 Today, we have had to fight a lot to declare all this
 yah prastaav cabinet se paas ho gaya he or alji sahab ko bheja gaya he
 i hope LG Sahab will accept the decision regarding the future of teachers
 akhir main kejariwal ne kaha ki guest teachers ko pakkaa karne kaa kaam dilli sarkaar jald se jald puraa kar legi
 '
 
 
 or bhaashan ke aakhir main kejariwal kii kahi ye baat puure hangaame kii ek badi vajah ban gai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi says that officers should not take stress, because if they take stress then they will not be able to work properly
 PM modi 'civil sarvice de' ke maukey par bhaashan de rahe the

 tippaniyan The Prime Minister said in a light manner that if you live there, you are always told to be serious
 kya vahaan khush rahane par pabandi he? is par vahaan jamaa adhikariyon ne jamkar thahaake lagaae
 Not only this, he said to lighten the mood of the officials, "don't bother, i will not tell you any new work
" modi ne kaha, agar adhikari tanaav main rahenge to kaam nahin hoga or agar kaam nahin hoga to sabhi pareshaan honge
 PM said, your life should not pass around files
 parivaar ke saath quality samay bitaana bhi zaruri he
 Life cannot be like a robot
 pradhanmantri ne halke-pulke andaaj main kaha ki kya jahaan rahete hai vahaan aapako hameshaa syrius rahane ko kaha jaataa he
 Is there a restriction on being happy there? On this, the officers gathered there laughed fiercely
 yahi nahin unhone adhikariyon kaa mood halkaa karne ke liye kaha ki pareshaan naa hon main aapako koi nayaa kaam nahin bataaungaa
 Modi said, if the officials remain tense, then there will be no work and if there is no work then everyone will be upset
 piem ne kaha, aapkaa jivan filon ke ird-gird hi nahin guzarana chahie
 It is also necessary to spend quality time with the family

 Roads in Srinagar were broken
 aabid ne bataaya ki pichhali baadh main sadaken tut gai thim
 It has not been repaired since
 pehle din kii yatra ke aakhir main ham pahunche hazaratbal dargah
 It is west of Dal Lake
 dal lake main iskaa pratibimb behad khubasurat lagata he
 Here the hair of Prophet Mohammad Sahab is kept
 khaas mauqon par shraddhaluon ke darshan ke liye ise baahar laayaa jaataa he
 "can we go in?" i asked Abid
 "kyon nahin" aabid ne kaha
 As we got off the car, beggars surrounded us
 badi mushkil se peechha chhudaa ham andar gaye
 It was told at the gate that there is no ticket here
 ham roomaal se sir dhakne lage to vahaan logon ne bataaya ki tapiyaan andar mil jaaengi
 Women were prohibited from leaving
 juute utaar kar ham andar gaye
 Sitting there with some closed eyes
 dil main ajeeb-sa dar tha, lekin vahaan baithne se sukun mila
 "did not like?" Like everywhere Abid asked as soon as he left
 "kyon nahin
 it was good
 shanti thi
 " main bacchon ko bataane laga ki yahaan kabhi aatankwaadi ghus aae the
 In October 1993, the Indian Army surrounded Hazratbal
 yahaan 65 aatankwaadi chhipe hue the
 Hazratbal remained in crisis for 32 days
 baad main pivi narsingh raav kii sarkaar ne sena ke virodh ke baavjood aatankwaadiyon ko "sef paisej" de diya
 i felt that something was going on Abid's mind after hearing the word "terrorist"
 shaayad use acha nahin laga, lekin vah khamosh rahaa
 Absolutely silent
 uski khamoshi kuch kah rahi thi
 Evening had come
 ham sab thak kar chur ho chuke the
 Hunger was also very strong
 aabid ne hamen ek pakora vaale ke paas drop kiya jo dal ke paas hi tha
 He had told that our house boat is in front of Ghat No
 5
 chaay pi or pakora pack karake ham get number 5 pahunche
 a shikar arrived before calling Maqbool with his houseboat
 use maaloom tha ki ham kis house boat main tehre hai
 At first he thought that he would ask for money, but he did not take money
 hamaare room main tivi nahin chal rahaa tha to bacchon ne shor machaana shuru kar diya
 Maqbool gave us a room next door
 vahaan jatan kar usne jarjar tivi chalaa diya, lekin ek musiibat or thi
 The IPL match was coming on Sony Six but the voice of another channel
 maqbool ise thik nahin kar paaya
 Nowadays children like to watch TV more than walking
 khayr houseboat par chaay or pakora kaa mazaa hi alag tha
 In the night light of the houseboat, the sparkling of Dal is very attractive
 ji chahta tha ki houseboat kii balakani main baithe dal kii khubsuurati ke nihaarte rahen, lekin aap yahaan bhi shanti se nahin baith sakate
 Suddenly a hawker enters the balcony and spreads his things and tries to sell us
 lekin aabid ne hamen pehle hi taakid kar di thi ki ye naav waalon ke jaanane vaale hi hote hai
 Do not buy anything
 uske jane ke baad ek naav par non wez bechney vaala aa jaataa he
 The family members of the houseboat were buying something from him
 house boat ke karmchaaree vahiin peeche rahete hai
 We were also thinking that we should buy something from him
 tabhi usne jhat se katori dal ke pani main hi dho lee
 Abid told us that the drainage of the boat goes to Dal
 chaay main makkhi dekhakar nigalane vaali baat thi
 Somehow avoided non veg
 haalanki acchhee baat ye thi ki jhil se koi durgandh nahin aa rahi thi or ek bhi machhar hamen nazar nahin aayaa
 The comments ek naav hamaari balakani kii taraf badhati ai
 This time there were photographers who were pressurizing us to be photographed in their traditional attire
 kaafii mushkil se inase bhi peechha chuta
 When we inspected the kitchen of our house boat, it was not felt that there was anything special to cook
 maqubal ne kaha ki khaanaa ban bhi saktaa he yaa phir wo laa degaa
 But the weather was so delightful that our weariness was far from over
 maqbool ne hamen naav se us paar pahunchaa diya
 He advised us to go to Shamiana restaurant
 usne kaha ki vahaan bade-bade ministar bhi aate hai
 Abid told us to eat elsewhere
 shamyana restaurant dal ke paas hi tha
 We liked the evening only
 ambiens acha tha
 There was a young couple on the side table
 ladkaa european or ladki asian jaan padati thi
 Both looked a bit upset
 ladki rispecian par jaakar land line se kisi se baat kar rahi thi
 By then, the waiter standing there was busy eyeing a troubled girl in tight clothes from top to bottom
 isiilie kisi ne kah rakhaa he ki jaisaa desh vaisaa bhesh hona chahie
 The girl returned to normal after talking on the phone
 order dene ke pehle donon waiter se tandoori chikan or afgani chikan main antar jaananaa chaah rahe the
 Asked about Cumin Rice
 waiter dharapravaah english main unhen samajhane main laga hua tha
 Both of them ordered a lot of food
 ab galati se kiya yaa itnaa sab kuch khaanaa kii kshamta thi ye nahin jaan paaya kyonki unke pehle hamaara khaanaa khatm ho chukaa tha
 The food was very tasty and there was very little bill in comparison to Delhi
 "kya ham andar ja sakate hai?" maine aabid se poocha
 "why not" said Abid
 car se utarate hi bhikhaariyon ne hamen gher liya
 We went inside with great difficulty
 get par bataaya gaya ki yahaan koi tikat nahin lagata
 When we started covering the head with a handkerchief, people there told that caps would be found inside
 mahilaon ko saamne se jane kii manaahi thi
 We took our shoes off and went inside
 vahaan kuch der ankhen moond kar baithe
 There was a strange fear in my heart, but it was comforting to sit there
 "acha nahin laga?" har jagah kii tarah aabid ne baahar nikalate hi poocha
 "why not
 acha tha
 There was peace
 " i started telling the children that terrorists had once entered here
 oktober 1993 main bhartiya sena ne hazaratbal ko gher liya tha
 There were 65 terrorists hiding here
 32 dinon tak hazaratbal sankat bana rahaa
 Later PV Narasimha Rao's government gave "safe passage" to the terrorists despite opposition from the army
 mujhe laga ki "aatankwaadi" shabd sunakar aabid ke jehan main kuch chalane laga tha
 Perhaps he did not like it, but he remained silent
 bilkul khamosh
 His silence was saying something
 shaam ho chuki thi
 We were all exhausted
 bhukh bhi jabardast lagi hui tha
 Abid dropped us to a pakodara who was near Dal
 usne bataa diya tha ki hamaara house boat ghat number 5 ke saamne he
 We arrived at gate number 5 after having tea and packing pakoras
 apane house boat vaale maqbool ko phone karte uske pehle ek shikare vaala aa gaya
 He knew which houseboat we stayed in
 pehle laga ki wo paise maangega, lekin usne paise nahin liye
 When the TV was not playing in our room, the children started making noise
 maqbool ne hamen bagal vaala room de diya
 After working there, he turned on a shabby TV, but there was another problem
 soni sicks par ipel kaa match aa to rahaa tha lekin awaz kisi duusare channel kii
 Maqbool could not fix it
 aaj kal ke bachche ghoomane se zyaada tivi dekhnaa pasand karte hai
 Well the fun of tea and dumplings on the houseboat itself was different
 house boat kii raat kii roshni main dal kii jagamagaahat behad dilkash hoti he
 i wanted to sit in the balcony of the houseboat, staring at the beauty of the Dal, but you cannot sit here peacefully
 achaanak ek pheriwala balakani main daakhil hota he or apane chijen faila kar hamen bechney kii koshish karata he
 But Abid had already told us that they are the only ones who know the boat
 kuch khareednaa nahin
 After he leaves, a non-veg seller arrives on a boat
 houseboat vaale ke parivaar ke log usase kuch kharid rahe the
 The staff of the house boat stay there
 hamaara bhi man ban rahaa tha ki usase kuch khariden
 Then he quickly washed the bowl in water
 aabid ne hamen bataaya tha ki boat kaa drenez dal main hi jaataa he
 Seeing a fly in tea was something to swallow
 kisi tarah non wez ko taala
 However the good thing was that there was no foul smell from the lake and we could not see a single mosquito
 tippaniyan a boat continued towards our balcony
 is baar photographer the, jo hamen vahaan kii paramparaagat poshaak main photo khinchvaane ke liye dabaav bana rahe the
 Hardly missed them too
 hamane apane house boat kii kichan kaa nirikshan kiya to laga nahin ki khaanaa banane ke liye kuch khaas saamaan padaa he
 Maqbal said that food can be made or it will bring it
 lekin mausam itnaa khushgavaar tha ki hamaari thakaavat ab tak dur ho chuki thi
 Maqbool drove us across the boat
 usne hamen shamyana restaurant main jane ke salaah di
 He said that big ministers also come there
 aabid ne hamen kahin or khaane ko bataaya tha
 Shamiana restaurant was near Dal
 hamen shamyana hi pasand aayaa
 Ambience was good
 saath vaale teble par ek yuva joda tha
 The boy appeared to be European and the girl Asian
 donon thode pareshaan lag rahe the
 The girl was talking to someone from the land line after going to the response
 tab tak vahaan khadaa waiter ne tang kapadon main pareshaan ladki ko upar se neeche tak ankhon se eksre karne main mashgool tha
 That is why someone has said that the country should be disguised as it is
 phone par baat karne ke baad ladki saamaanya hui
 Before ordering, both of them were trying to know the difference between Tandoori Chicken and Afghani Chicken
 jira rice ke bare main poocha
 The waiter was engaged in explaining them in fluent English
 donon ne dher sara khaanaa order kar diya
 Now i did not know by mistake or had the ability to eat so much because our food was finished before them
 khaanaa behad lajij tha or dilli ke muqaabale kaafii kam bill aayaa

 The comments ek naav hamaari balakani kii taraf badhati ai
 This time there were photographers who were pressurizing us to be photographed in their traditional attire
 kaafii mushkil se inase bhi peechha chuta
 When we inspected the kitchen of our house boat, it was not felt that there was anything special to cook
 maqubal ne kaha ki khaanaa ban bhi saktaa he yaa phir wo laa degaa
 But the weather was so delightful that our weariness was far from over
 maqbool ne hamen naav se us paar pahunchaa diya
 He advised us to go to Shamiana restaurant

 Abid told us to eat elsewhere

 There was a young couple on the side table

 By then, the waiter standing there was busy eyeing a troubled girl in tight clothes from top to bottom

 Asked about Cumin Rice

 Both of them ordered a lot of food

 The food was very tasty and there was very little bill in comparison to Delhi
 chaay pi or pakora pack karake ham get number 5 pahunche
 a shikar arrived before calling Maqbool with his houseboat
 use maaloom tha ki ham kis house boat main tehre hai
 At first he thought that he would ask for money, but he did not take money
 hamaare room main tivi nahin chal rahaa tha to bacchon ne shor machaana shuru kar diya
 Maqbool gave us a room next door
 vahaan jatan kar usne jarjar tivi chalaa diya, lekin ek musiibat or thi
 The IPL match was coming on Sony Six but the voice of another channel
 maqbool ise thik nahin kar paaya
 Nowadays children like to watch TV more than walking
 khayr houseboat par chaay or pakora kaa mazaa hi alag tha
 In the night light of the houseboat, the sparkling of Dal is very attractive
 ji chahta tha ki houseboat kii balakani main baithe dal kii khubsuurati ke nihaarte rahen, lekin aap yahaan bhi shanti se nahin baith sakate
 Suddenly a hawker enters the balcony and spreads his things and tries to sell us
 lekin aabid ne hamen pehle hi taakid kar di thi ki ye naav waalon ke jaanane vaale hi hote hai
 Do not buy anything

 house boat kii raat kii roshni main dal kii jagamagaahat behad dilkash hoti he
 i wanted to sit in the balcony of the houseboat, staring at the beauty of the Dal, but you cannot sit here peacefully
 achaanak ek pheriwala balakani main daakhil hota he or apane chijen faila kar hamen bechney kii koshish karata he
 But Abid had already told us that they are the only ones who know the boat
 kuch khareednaa nahin
 After he leaves, a non-veg seller arrives on a boat
 houseboat vaale ke parivaar ke log usase kuch kharid rahe the
 The staff of the house boat stay there
 hamaara bhi man ban rahaa tha ki usase kuch khariden
 Then he quickly washed the bowl in water
 aabid ne hamen bataaya tha ki boat kaa drenez dal main hi jaataa he
 Seeing a fly in tea was something to swallow
 kisi tarah non wez ko taala
 However the good thing was that there was no foul smell from the lake and we could not see a single mosquito
 tippaniyan a boat continued towards our balcony
 is baar photographer the, jo hamen vahaan kii paramparaagat poshaak main photo khinchvaane ke liye dabaav bana rahe the
 Hardly missed them too
 hamane apane house boat kii kichan kaa nirikshan kiya to laga nahin ki khaanaa banane ke liye kuch khaas saamaan padaa he
 Maqbal said that food can be made or it will bring it
 lekin mausam itnaa khushgavaar tha ki hamaari thakaavat ab tak dur ho chuki thi
 Maqbool drove us across the boat
 usne hamen shamyana restaurant main jane ke salaah di
 He said that big ministers also come there
 aabid ne hamen kahin or khaane ko bataaya tha
 Shamiana restaurant was near Dal
 hamen shamyana hi pasand aayaa
 Ambience was good
 saath vaale teble par ek yuva joda tha
 The boy appeared to be European and the girl Asian
 donon thode pareshaan lag rahe the
 The girl was talking to someone from the land line after going to the response
 tab tak vahaan khadaa waiter ne tang kapadon main pareshaan ladki ko upar se neeche tak ankhon se eksre karne main mashgool tha
 That is why someone has said that the country should be disguised as it is
 phone par baat karne ke baad ladki saamaanya hui
 Before ordering, both of them were trying to know the difference between Tandoori Chicken and Afghani Chicken
 jira rice ke bare main poocha
 The waiter was engaged in explaining them in fluent English
 donon ne dher sara khaanaa order kar diya
 Now i did not know by mistake or had the ability to eat so much because our food was finished before them
 khaanaa behad lajij tha or dilli ke muqaabale kaafii kam bill aayaa

 team india or sanyukt arab emirate ke bich jeet kaa nateeja sabko pehle hi maaloom tha
 If something had happened, there would have been a huge upsurge
 bharat ko mili nau wicket kii jeet main acchhee baat ye rahi ki bharat ne yuai team ko 32wein over main hi ol out kar diya jabaki team india ne sirf ek wicket khokar 19wein over main hi ye lakshya puraa kar liya
 That is, a total of 50 overs 2 balls were bowled in the entire match
 captain emes dhoni ne jeet ke baad kaha ki puri team ek complit unit kii tarah khel rahi he
 That is, Team India looks better than ever in every aspect of the game
 maahi ne kaha ki gendbaaz or ballebaazi pehle se behatar hui he or haalanki team ne ek kaich drop kiya lekin filding shandaar nazar ai he
 The captain says that this has not happened in just one match
 team ne jeet kii hetric lagaai he or captain maanate hai ki team ko acha pradarshan barqaraar rakhana hoga
 Dhoni said that the bowlers of Team India are taking wickets in the middle overs
 isliye ab gendbaaz vipakshi ballebaazon par dabaav bana paa rahe hai
 Dhoni also praised Bhuvneshwar Kumar's bowling for returning from injury
 bhubaneshwar kumaar ne 5 overon main 19 ran kharch kar ek wicket apane naam kiya
 It is obvious that Team India's fans are praising Dhoni after every win
 is list main ab purv bhartiya footbaal captain bichung bhutia kaa naam bhi jud gaya he jo maanate hai ki emes dhoni team india ke ab tak ke behtareen captain hai
 He feels that Dhoni will definitely win the World Cup this time too

 Ivanka Trump, the daughter and advisor of US President Donald Trump, is visiting India to attend the ongoing Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES) in Hyderabad
 unke saath america udhyamiyon kaa pratinidhimandal bhi aayaa hua
 In June, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had very carefully invited Ivanka to come to the GES during her visit to America
 mangalvaar kodeghashmen piem modi ne ivaanka kaa garmjoshi se swaagat kiya
 The two inaugurated and held a three-day GES
 is baithak main videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj bhi shaamil raheen
 Now the question is arising that why was Ivanka specifically invited by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to participate in this summit? PM Modi had also tweeted about this, after which Ivanka thanked him for this
 Delighted to have met you at the White House
 Look forward to welcoming you in India for the Global Entrepreneurship Summit later this year
 https: / / t
 co / qhquoddftl — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) June 27, 2017 It is believed that PM Modi has taken this decision after much deliberation
 ivaanka ko bulaane kii asli vajah ye maani ja rahi hai
 
 
 
 1
 This is the first time since 2010 that GES is being held in South Asia
 is teen divasiy summit main kareeb 170 deshon ke 1,500 udhyami hissaa le rahe hai, jisamen udhyamiyon kaa sabase bada pratinidhimandal america se aayaa hua he
 The American delegation consists of about 350 entrepreneurs
 isamen bhartiya mul kii america mahila udhyami bhi shaamil hai
 Therefore, Modi preferred to invite Ivanka to lead such a large American delegation
 2
 The second reason behind inviting Ivanka Trumpka was that this time the theme of the summit is 'women First, Prosperity for All' and Ivanka is also a successful entrepreneur
 mana ja rahaa he ki modi ne mahila udhyamiyon or niveshkon ke bich sakaaratmak sandesh bhejne ke iraade se ivaanka ko america udhyamiyon ke pratinidhimandal ke netritv ke rup main aamantrit karnaa zyada upyukt samajha
 Thank you for the warm welcome

 khaskar america niveshkon ko aakarshith karne main bhi madad milegi

 akhushi hatyakand main sibiai ne apni antim report main kiya gaya he ek ahm khulaasa
 The CBI claims that the strings of Aarushi's killers are connected to Punjab
 sibiai kii report main kaha gaya he ki 16 may 2008 ko aarushi or hemraj ke katl ke baad 17 may ko hemraj ke mobile kii lokation punjab mil rahi thi
 That is, the wires of the killers are connected to Punjab
 sibiai ne ek auki ahm baat report main likhi he ki aarushi kaa kaatil jo bhi he wo ghar main hi maujuud he
 The country's largest investigative agency succumbed to the country's biggest murder mystery
 buudhvaar ko behad khamoshi se sibiai ne is katl ko filon main dafan kar diya
 On behalf of the CBI, the investigating officer confessed that despite all efforts, the CBI could not find evidence in the investigation of this murder
 sutron ke mutabik sibiai ne teen maheene pehle aarushi ke pita rajesh talwaar par shikanja kasnaa shuru kiya tha lekin khamoshi se jaanch kii is disha se mud gayi
 In this case, the needle of suspicion also turned towards father Rajesh Talwar
 haalanki cese band hone par rajesh talwaar ne dukh jataayaa he
 In the last two years, there have been revelations in the Aarushi murder case
 16 may, 2008 kii raat noida ke jalwaayu vihaar main 14 saal kii aarushi kii bedroom main dhardaar hathiyaar se hatya kar di gayi thi
 Aarushi's father nominated his servant Hemraj as a murderer in the FIR
 lekin agle hi din hemraj kii laash ghar kii chat par mili
 In its investigation, Noida police found Aarushi's father Dr
 Rajesh Talwar dead and arrested and sent to jail
 upi kii mukhyamantri mayawati ne jaanch sibiai ko saunpi ne or agency ne yutern lete hue hatya kaa dosha talwaar ke compounder krishna par madh diya
 Shockingly, due to non-recovery of arms in the court, Rajesh Talwar as well as Krishna and his associates were granted bail
 dilli police ne aarushi kaa mobile phone bhi baraamad kiya
 The CBI repeatedly changed the investigation officers under the pressure of the media but the result was the same
 america ne pakistan ko die jane vaale aarthik madad par yah kehete hue roak laga di he ki vah hamase madad le rahaa he or apane yahaan aatankwaadiyon ko panaah de rahaa he
 In his tweet, the US President described Pakistan as a fraud and a liar
 america ne paak ko 25 karod 50 lakh dollar kii sainya madad par roak to laga diya he, lekin iskaa sabase zyada asar kis par padegapakistanya america par, abhi yah kahana aasaan nahin hoga lekin abhi ke halaat par dekha jaae to pakistan ko phayda miltaa dikh rahaa he
 Giriraj said - Trump's tweet against PAK PM Modi's diplomatic victory
 If you look at the figures, from the time of Barack Obama, America started to lose money on the financial assistance given to Pakistan
 7 saal pehle 2010 main america ne suraksha ke liye pakistan ko 1
 Assisted 24 billion dollars, by 2016, this help reduced to 316 million dollars
 is baar america ne 25 karod 50 lakh dollar kii jo sainya madad madad roki he wo pichhali baar se bhi kahin kam he
 However, US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley says that US President Donald Trump is fully prepared to stop the aid of Pakistan
 america paak ko die jane vaale madad ke sabhi aarthik raste band karnaa chahta he
 The US, trapped in Afghanistan, was a plan to curb terrorism, al-qaeda and the Taliban, following the us's help to Pakistan
 9 / 11 kii ghatana ke baad 2001 main america ne afghanistan main pravesh kiya, tab use britain or canada samet 40 deshon kaa samarthan bhi hasil tha
 He waged a war against terror here in the name of Operation Enduring freedom-afghanistan (2001–14)
 phir 2014 ke baad sahyogi deshon or sanghathan ke hatane ke baad bhi vah vahaan bana rahaa
 In this campaign, America spent money like water and more than 500 billion dollars were spent
 is sangharsh main 50 hajaar se zyada jaane bhi gayi
 The US will not spare the PAK, now eyeing the backbone of terrorist funding, used to carry out its operations with the help of Pakistan in Afghanistan, a stronghold of US terror
 yah alag baat he ki kai khoonkhaar aatankiyon ko paak ne apane yahaan panaah bhi di
 In May 2011, the US sneaked and killed Osama bin Laden, a terrorist hiding in Abbottabad, Pakistan
 is abhiyaan ke liye usne pakistan ko bhi saajhe main nahin liya
 America used to get Pakistan to do its work in the name of this economic military help
 america aaj bhi afghanistan main aatank ke khatme or shanti bahaali ke prayaas main juta hua he
 In this campaign, he will have to seek help from Afghanistan's neighboring country Pakistan
 agar puri tarah se madad na sahi to bhi usase is baat kaa pakkaa aashwaasan lenaa padegaa ki afgani aatankiyon ko vah apane yahaan panaah nahin degaa
 China will be helpful now when the US has stopped military help on Pakistan in a stern attitude and is thinking of stopping all kind of help in future
 to use yah dekhnaa hoga ki america se dur is desh main apane mishan ko ab kaise anjaam degaa
 On the other hand, America used to maintain its reach in South Asia in the name of giving help to Pakistan and Afghanistan, now it will not be possible to do anything in the name of help from Pakistan
 philhal pakistan jis tarah se tevar dikhaa rahaa he usase lagata he ki vah america kii madad na kare
 America is not very good in Afghanistan
 vahiin, america se madad nahin milane ke baad pakistan china kii taraf ruukh karegaa
 China has always supported Pakistan and on this front too it seems to be fully supportive
 is samay antarrashtriya birdari main china hi vah desh he jo america ko kadi chunauti de rahaa he
 So it can be clear from this that Pakistan will not be harmed by this ban, but it is showing itself in two ways
 pehla america ke dabaav se mukti mil jaaegi
 Second, there will be no one to stop you from sheltering the terrorists
 china use aisa karne se nahin rokegaa kyonki use maaloom he ki paak ke jariye in aatankiyon kaa istemaal bharat ke khilaaf kiya ja sakegaa

 Former South African cricketer Jonty Rhodes believes that it would not be ideal for India to have different captains in each format, like England and South Africa
 rods ne kaha, aap keval isliye kisi ko captain nahin bana sakate kyonki koi vah pad nahin nibhaa paa rahaa he
 It is important for a captain to have leadership skills
 yadi (bhartiya captain mahendra singh) dhoni vishram chaahate hai to bharat nishchit taur par kisi anya ko niyukt kar saktaa he
 He said, India has cricketers like Virat Kohli and Gautam Gambhir
 gambhir kolkata niterides kii taraf se acchhee bhoomika nibhaa rahaa he or dhoni kii jagah le saktaa he
 Rhodes, known for his excellent fielding at Backward Point, made it clear that his country and England were forced to appoint different captains for different formats
 unhone kaha, greem smith ne simit overon kii captaini chhod di thi
 AB de Villiers broke his finger so Hashim Amla was made the captain
 smith ko ab bhi lagata he ki vah test captaini main uchit bhoomika nibhaa saktaa he
 De Villiers could possibly be the next captain in the Test
 rods ne kaha, england ke paas teen bhinn praaroop ke liye teen captain hai
 The amount of cricket being played these days requires different skills for different formats
 chunaav sar par he aise main sabhi raajnneetik partiyaan edi- chotii kaa jor laga rahi he
 At the same time, a survey was conducted in three well-known universities of Gujarat, whose aim was to make the youth aware of the franchise
 magar queri form main jo sawaal die gaye, vah narendra modi ke pradhanmantri pad se sambandhit the
 While BJP is considering this survey as a decision of the youth, the Congress is describing these questions as a new move by Modi
 darasal yah survey vadodara ke emes uniwarsity ke ek ke varisht profesar dow suresh ptaani kii adhyakshata main gujarat kii sardaar patel uniwarsity, gujarat uniwarsity or vadodara kii maharaja sayajirao uniwarsity ke takreeban teen hajaar se zyada chaatro ke bich karwaae gaye
 In the survey, students were asked information about name, address, contact, voting, as well as questions were asked about what they like Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi as development men of the country and its why the hell
 is survey main main 92 fisadi hindu chaatro , 3 fisadi muslim or 5 fisadi isai chaatro ko shaamil kiya gaya
 The result of the survey was very shocking
 narendra modi ke paksh main 70 pratishat yuva chaatro ne vot kiya
 But only 17 per cent of the students want to see Rahul Gandhi as the young Prime Minister
 is survey ko karne waalon kii maane to bhartiya janata party ne 5 hajaar se lekar 50 hajaar ke margin se jo loksabhaa kii seat ganvaai he, isamen agar yah yuva voting list main aate he to narendra modi ke liye game changer ban sakate hai
 Regarding this survey, Dr
 Suresh Patani explains that 'we have to understand the importance of the vote of the youth
 survey se spasht he ki yuvaaon kii pasand narendra modi hai
 i believe that there should be no politics in this
 desh kaa yuva agar vot dene se vanchit rah gaaya to yah desh ke liye acha nahin hoga
 'for the first time such a sample survey was conducted in the entire country, in which many college professors also got involved in the compilation
 magar shiksha main is tarah ke raajnneetik survey ko lekar chaatr ek alag hi sonch rakhte hai
 Students clearly believe that this survey has been done for political benefit
 uniwarsity ke kuch chaatro ke mutabik agar survey kaa makasad sahi hota to uniwarsity ke sabhi 35 hajaar chaatro se cemple liye jate
 On the other hand, the Congress is telling the entire survey the hidden agenda of Narendra Modi, and if he believes that Narendra Modi himself could not win his party in the elections of MS University Students Union in Vadodara city, then what would he understand the youth of the whole country
 congress ne puure survey ko gaiyrkanoonee qaraar diya or kaha ki congress iskaa ugr virodh karegi
 In Vadodara, Congress leader Narendra Rawat said, 'BJP has made universities an arena of politics, which we strongly condemn'
 bijepi ise parivartan kaa naam de rahi he , to congress ise bijepi kii raajnneeti kaa naam de rahi he, lekin is survey se itnaa to saaf he ki bijepi ho, yaa congress donon hi shiksha main ho rahi is raajnneeti kaa istemaal apane phaayde ke liye hi kar rahe he

 Pawar's move is considered to be his acceptance of the 'clean India' campaign of the NDA government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 iske baad pradhanmantri modi ne sharad pavaar kii saraahna kii
 He tweeted and wrote, 'sharad Pawar ji's initiative is outlandish
 safai abhiyaan ko unka samarthan savachh bharat ke nirmaan main madadgaar sabit hoga
 However, in an effort to leave a distinct identity of NCP in this campaign, Pawar had announced a few days ago that his party workers would launch a cleanliness drive in Maharashtra in view of the increasing cases of dengue
 baraamati main abhiyaan kii shuruyaat karne ke baad unhone kaha, ‘hamane aaj swatchta abhiyaan shuru kiya he or tasviren lee gai hai

 It is necessary for any party with Muslim support to balance the concessions that please the Muslims but not so much that the majority community feels isolated

 Parties like Samajwadi Party and some sections of Congress in Uttar Pradesh try to show Muslims that they have been given special facilities which often prove to be incomplete promises

 Shah raised questions on protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act 370, CAA, NRC were all raised by the Congress, today the same Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who is opposing, has questioned the Congress about the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act across the country
 unhone mangalvaar ko kaha ki aaj congress jin muddon ko lekar virodh pradarshan kar rahi he, wo sab usee ke mudde hai
 370, CAA, NRC were all created by Congress, today if they oppose the same, then do not question them
 amit shah ne 1994 ke ayodhya act kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki congress ke hi act kaa paalan kar rahaa hum to bhi main sampradayik ho gaya
 
 to bhai aapane aisa act kyon banaaya? naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon par bataata hum
 Nehru ji had said with agreement that we promise that we will protect our minorities
 congress ne bhi bahut se logon se ye baat kahi
 If he (congress) said this, he did not become communal but we are saying that he became communal
 uske baad enarasi kii baat karte hai
 The concept of NRC was brought by Rajiv Gandhi and Mrs Sonia Gandhi is protesting
 rajeev gandhi lekar aae to wo secular tha or main unki banaai vyavastha ko lagu kar rahaa hum to communal hum
 i do not understand what to do if we do? Amit Shah said that all these were acts of your (congress), were laws
 sab aapane banaae
 Why are you protesting now? unase sawaal poochna chahie
 As a guest at Aaj Tak's 'agenda Aaj Tak 2019' program, Home Minister Amit Shah said that at the time when Article 370 was enacted, most of the leaders in the Constituent Assembly belonged to the Congress
 nehru ji ne sansad main kaha he ki 370 ghiste ghiste ghis jaaegi to hamane ghis daali
 What is new in this? 
 
 bhai aapane hi kaha tha ki ye asthaayee he
 Amit Shah said that at the time when Article 370 was created, most of the leaders in the Constituent Assembly were from the Congress, no one can raise a dispute in it
 usko (anuchhed 370) asthaayee likhaa gaya tha
 Why wrote temporary
 
 
 ? ise sthaayee kar dete to hataane kaa sawaal hi nahin aata
 The way to remove it was put in 370, why was it inserted? You (congress) have entered
 nehru ji ne sansad main kaha he ki 370 ghiste ghiste ghis jayega to hamane ghis daali
 What is new in this? 
 
 bhai aapane hi kaha tha ki ye asthaayee he
 On the issue of new citizenship law and National Citizenship Register (NRC) across the country, Amit Shah said that when NRC brought Rajiv Gandhi, it was secular, now Sonia Gandhi is opposing
 amit shah ne kaha, 'main spasht kar duun ki enarasi main dharm ke aadhaar par koi karrwai nahin hogi
 Whoever is not found to be a citizen of this country under NRC will be removed
 isliye enarasi sirf musalamaanon ke liye he yah kahana galat baat he
 He said, 'who brought the other thing to NRC? i want to ask those who are protesting who brought it
 main congress adhyaksh or gulam nabi aaazaad se poochna chahta hum ki 1985 main jab assam samjhauta hua tab pehali baar enarasi kii baat sweekaar kii gai
 Then Clause 14 (a) was added to the Citizenship Act of 1955 on 3 December 2004
 isse spasht he ki 3 disambar 2004 ko upie kii sarkaar thi
 Our government was not there
 uske baad main rule 4 joda gaya, jo deshbhar main enarasi banane ko takat detaa he, wo bhi 9 november 2009 ko joda gaya
 At that time also the Congress was in government
 unke (congress) banaae kanoon par wo hamase hi sawaal kar rahe hai
 So did you make the law to put on a show case? If it did not seem necessary, then why did the law be made? 'after looking at the CAA and NRC, the question arises that what is the intention of the government? On this question, Amit Shah said that do not try to relate this issue with the constituency
 ise thodaa peeche jaakar dekhnaa hoga
 First of all, the division of the country should not have been done on the basis of religion
 lekin yah katu satya he ki is desh kaa vibhaajan dharm ke aadhaar par hua
 Partition should never be on the basis of religion, but the Congress surrendered in the name of divided religion
 is desh kaa vibhaajan dharm ke aadhaar par hua
 Amit Shah said that the Congress divided the country on the basis of religion
 ye nahin hona chahie tha
 Many people were hurt in this
 1950 main nehru or liyakat ali khan main samjhauta hua ki donon desh apane alpsankhyakon kii suraksha karenge
 Look at the figures since then, the number of minorities in Pakistan has reduced

 Then there was a need to do this

 actress ne bataaya ki shooting se pehle reharsal ke dauraan actor ne unhen gale galaaya or unki peeth par upar se neeche tak galat tareeke se haath phiraaya
 The actress said that all this was done without her consent
 actress ne likhaa, "main hairaan thi
 i want to put the reality in my acting on screen, but it made me feel completely wrong
 mujhe unki harakat bahut ghatiya lagi or bahut gussa aayaa kyonki main nahin samaj paa rahi thi ki us vakt unase kya kahuun
