 Former Chief Minister Jagannath Mishra, who has been allotted 41, Kranti Marg government bungalow, also said that the government bungalow should be vacated after the Supreme Court order

 Gadkari's statement is seen against the backdrop of remarks made by BJP secretary Balbir Punj against JDU on Monday
 punj ne kaha tha ki bhaajapa ne kisi ko yah vichaar karne kaa kaam nahin saunpa he ki party main pradhanmantri pad ke liye koun thik he or koun dharmanirpeksh he
 Gadkari said that the BJP believes that the coalition has played a historical role despite having different opinions on the issue of presidential elections in the NDA and will continue to do so to remove the country from the current problems
 unhone kaha ki rajg kaa prayek sahyogi dal anya gathbandhan sahyogiyon dwaara apanaaye rukh kaa paraspar sammaan karata he
 Gadkari said that i request all party officials and other friends in NDA to exercise restraint while speaking on issues related to NDA

 The controversy started when JDU ran for Presidential election
 sahmati kii vakaalat karte hue samprag ke ummidavaar pranav mukherjee ko samarthan karne kii baat kahi jabaki bhaajapa chunaav ladane ke paksh main thi
 The altercation increased when Bihar Chief Minister and JDU leader Nitish Kumar, without naming Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, targeted him in a way that the nda's prime ministerial claim should be secular and acceptable to all allies
 donon dalon main badhate tanaav ke bich jadyu adhyaksh sharad yadav ne somvaar ko gadakari se is maamle main baatcheet kii or donon ne badhate vivaad ko shant karne par sahmati jataai
 Yadav, who is also the responsibility of NDA convenor, said on Punj's statement that what was needed was his untimely and irrational statement by BJP mps who also look after their party's affairs for Gujarat
 maine bhaajapa adhyaksh nitin gadakari se baatcheet kii he
 They should stop people like this
 is tarah kii anaavashyak baaten nahin honi chahie

 Deepawali, the festival of lamps, may tell the story of the victory of light over darkness, but the light which we have been using since ancient times to defeat the darkness, its light is now being dimmed
 roshni ke parv par na tel or na hi baati, ab to dragon liton (china nirmit balb) kii raushnee ke bich dhan-dhaany kii devi lakshmi kii puja-archana hone lagi he
 The market adorned on Deepawali has dozens of items with gel rice, LED, crystal, matka, pipe light, rocket LED, Udahaul Phool and Mirchi Welt
 in bazaaron main diya or mombati bhi hai, lekin inamen tel or rooyee kii baati nahin he
 These lamps and candles are lighted
 is chamak-damak ke aage bhartiya paramparaagat raishani ke jariye ab dam tod rahe hai
 Due to the attack of the dragon market on the tradition of lighting diyas, there has also been a tragedy on the livelihood of a particular caste
 unke liye parv-tyohaar salbhar kii kamai kaa jariya hota tha, lekin ab videshi 'ghuspaith' ke kaaran tyohaar to desi manaaya ja rahaa he, magar tarika videshi ho gaya he
 The business of clay lamps has come to a standstill
 mitti ke diye kaa kaarobaar karne vaale ab deepawali par bahut zyada diya nahin banaate
 Mathura Prajapati, a businessman of Diya in Patna's Raja Bazar, says that four-five years ago, where he used to sell 20 thousand diyas easily, now five thousand diyas are also difficult to sell
 unki maane to deepawali se zyada diye shaadi-byaah ke lagn ke dauraan bik jate hai
 Vipin Kumar, a businessman from Chandni Market in Patna, who is associated with the business of Jhalar, says that although such lights continue to be sold throughout the year in Patna, but its sales increase five times in Deepawali
 deepawali ko lekar bazaar nae itamon se bhar gaya he
 It has included everything from laser lights to waterproof lights
 dukandaar kehete hai ki bhagwaan kii akruti vaali lite bhi logon kii pehali pasand bane hue hai
 People with music mantra light, light on shiva-parvati and Ganesha idol, Ganesh light on betel leaves are also liked
 kul milakar ab logon ke ashiyane bhi chote hote ja rahe hai or parv manaane kii paramparaayen bhi badal rahi hai

 At a time when rumors arising out of social media in the country are becoming the reasons for the murderous attacks on innocent people, such news of meaningful use of social media is necessary to be discussed
 *** On the night of 26 November 2008, when the terrorist attack took place in Mumbai, Chief Joint Commissioner of Maharashtra ATS Hemant Karkare went out on the road to take charge
 unke ohade ke hisaab se wo daftar main baithkar ranneeti bana sakate the lekin hemanth karkare ne baahar aakar saamana kiya or shahid ho gaye
 No one gets the post of head of anti-terror squad

 Hemant Karkare has his credentials in the Maharashtra Police
 hemanth karkare kii jaanch ke aadhaar par dakshinpanthi sanghathan abhinav bharat ke sadasyon ko maalegaanv dhamaake main giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 If the investigation of Hemant Karkare does not reach Sadhvi Pragya Thakur, Lieutenant Colonel Purohit and others, then there will not be so much political arrogance on Hindu terrorism
 shuukravaar ko isi maamle main NIA ne jab apana chargeshit pesh kiya to kaiyon ko laga ki hemanth karkare kii jaanch ko hi sandigdh bana diya gaya he
 Would such an officer who did not even care for his life do such an investigation that a theory of terrorism would float in the air that no one is ready to believe
 maharashtra main police cover karne vaale patrkaar bataate hai ki hemanth karkare jaanch puri kar kai dinon tak intazaar karte rahe taaki koi jaldbaazi na ho jaae
 He was stepping into the blaze so that his investigation does not come under the scanner
 hemanth karkare ne jaanch kaa kaam sambhalate hi team se poocha tha ki sirf dharm ke aadhaar par jaanch kyon ho rahi he
 Why is there no investigation on any other line
 hemanth karkare kii saakh na hoti to mumbai ke goregaanv main karkare ke naam par ek park nahin hota
 There is also a park in Pune
 2010 main maalegaanv kii ek sadak kaa naam bhi hemanth karkare ke upar rakhaa gaya he
 In 2009, Bihar's capital Patna also has a road named Hemant Karkare Road

 While presenting the charge sheet in the Malegaon blast case, Director General of NIA Sharad Kumar was asked by the journalist that the NIA had been opposing the accused of the Malegaon blast at first

 When the NIA presented its charge sheet in the same case on Friday, many felt that the investigation of Hemant Karkare has been made suspicious
 kya aisa afasar jisane apni jaan kii parvaah tak nahin kii wo aisi jaanch karegaa jisase aatankwaad kii ek aisi theory hawa main tairne lagegi jis par koi yakeen karne ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 Journalists covering the police in Maharashtra tell that Hemant Karkare waited for several days after completing the investigation so that there is no haste
 wo phoonk phoonk kar kadam rakh rahe the taaki unki jaanch sawaalon ke ghere main na aa jaae
 Hemant Karkare, while handling the investigation, asked the team why the investigation was being done only on the basis of religion
 kisi or line par jaanch kyon nahin ho rahi he
 If Hemant Karkare had no credibility, there would not have been a park named after Karkare in Goregaon, Mumbai
 pune main bhi ek park he
 In 2010, a road in Malegaon has also been named after Hemant Karkare
 2009 main bihar kii rajdhani patna main bhi ek sadak kaa naam hemanth karkare road rakhaa gaya he
 a Chennai-based organization also awards in the name of Hemant Karkare
 hemanth karkare kii patni kavita karkare ne bhi apni maut ke baad sharir ke saare ang daan de diye the
 Hemanth Karkare's wife Kavita Karkare, when Narendra Modi announced the award of one crore as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, declined and refused to meet any politician
 maalegaanv dhamaake maamle main chargeshit pesh karte hue NIA ke mahanideshak sharad kumaar se jab patrkaar ne poocha ki enie pehle to maalegaanv dhamaake ke aropiyon kaa virodh karti rahi he
 Has he changed his stand now? to unhone kaha, 'jab tak hamaari jaanch puri nahin ho gai thi tab tak hamen aties kii jaanch par nirbhar hona padaa tha
 Now we have completed the investigation
 isliye hamane antim chargeshit daayar kar di he
 ' samachar agency pitiai ne enie chif kaa yah bayaan prakashit kiya he
 Hemat Karkare's team must have gathered some evidence against Sadhvi Pragya and five others, only then did they go so far
 saat saal se sadhvi pragna or leftinent karnal purohit jail main hai
 Is it enough to say that there is not enough evidence
 kya yah nahin bataaya janaa chahie ki saat saal tak jail main rakhane ke peeche kis tarah sabooton se chhedchhad hui
 This case has also been passing through the eyes of all the courts
 wo motorcycle jo sadhvi pragna ke naam par thi or jis par dhamaake hue the wo baat kahaan gai
 It was alleged on this basis
 sadhvi kaa kahana tha ki unki gaadi do saal se sahakarmi istamaal kar rahaa tha isliye unka role nahin he
 The agency argued that the coworker is working with you
 gaadi yahaan tak ai he uske bich main kuch log hai jinaki hatya ho gai he
 All these things can be said in detail only when you will know what is written in the charge sheet
 lekin kya enie ne dakshin panthi sanghathan abhinav bharat ko aarope mukt kar diya he
 Has the NIA discharged Lieutenant Colonel Purohit
 abhi bhi das logon ke kilaaf kathith rup se aarope barkaraar hai
 There are still allegations against Lt
 Col
 Purohit of supplying gunpowder, bombing and conspiracy
 2006 or 2008 ke alag-alag maalegaanv dhamaako ke aropiyon main do naam ek se hai
 The NIA admits that these two people were allegedly active in these blasts
 dakshinpanthi sanghathan abhinav bharat ke sadasyon ke naam is aarope patr main bhi hai
 The comments sadhvi pragna or paanch ke kilaaf macoka hataaya gaya he kyonki macoka lagu karne ke saboot nahin mili he
 So, did this change the course of the investigation or was it just a relief to Sadhvi Pragya as the opposition also dragged the Sangh due to her relationship with BJP and Sangh leaders
 pichley saal se hi media ke zariye sanket mil rahe the ki sadhvi pragna ko raahat mil sakati he
 As soon as the chargesheet was filed, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala named the NIA as the Namo Investigative Agency whose job is to give a clean chit to BJP supporters
 randeep surajevaala ne kaha ki modi ji maalegaanv kii jaanch karne vaale hemanth karkare kii satyanishtha par sawaal khadaa kar unki eemaandaaree ko dhoomil mat kiijie
 Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that we will not leave the right, we will trap the wrong
 bijepi ne bhi aarope lagaaya ki upie ne kai logon ko bevajaah fansaaya he
 According to the report of the Indian Express, the prosecution lawyer i
e
 government lawyer Avinash Rasal has said that he was not aware that the charge sheet was being filed
 main dukhi hum or istipha de saktaa hum
 Now he has refused to resign and said that he is angry with the way the junior public prosecutor has been presented in the charge sheet in the court
 isse pehle rohinee sanial ne bhi kaha tha unke upar dabaav he ki enie ke kuch afasar unase kah rahe hai ki ve is maamle main dhimaa chalem
 There was a lot of uproar then
 hamaare sahyogi shrinivasana jain ne pichley saal july main unase baat kii thi
 On Friday, he refused to talk but you can see his interview
 aasaan angrezi main he
 How a public prosecutor of this case was watching everything happen
 rohinee sanial shuru se is cese se judi rahi hai
 Even when the Maharashtra ATS was watching it and even when the NIA took over in 2011
 hemanth karkare kii saakh na hoti to mumbai ke goregaanv main karkare ke naam par ek park nahin hota
 There is also a park in Pune

 ) ek minute ke liye ham is siries ke liye patrika ke sampadakon kii ore se chune gaye sheershak par najar daalate hai
 Hindutva, as we all know, means "the essence of Hindu thought, religion and faith
" " agar vaaki aisa he to is lekh kaa sheershak ek yugma ke rup main ''hindu or hindutv" hona chahie tha
 But if it is separated from the word "versus", there is a reason
 ''hindu banaam hindutv" sheershak bilkul uchit he kyonki kai kamiyon ke baavjood pehle vaala sheershak ek khule vichaar vaala or samaveshi he jabaki baad vaala sheershak kattarpanthi he
 There is no room for Dalits, Muslims, Christians and anyone other than Hindu faith
 ek or baat hamen kabhi nahin bhulani chahie ki hindutv kaa vichaar rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or uski sambhddha bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) kii dharohar he
 Hinduism and Hindutva have the same curse, and that is the caste system
 khaskar uskaa vah hissaa jisamen achhuton, jinhen ham aajkal dalit kehete hai, ko samaaj se baahar kar diya jaataa he
 Dr
 ambedkar ne apane logon ko buddha dharm main parivartit karke asprishyata ke is abhishaap ko dur karne kii koshish kii thi
 It is a matter of debate whether this step changed the status of Dalits or not
 chunaav kaa samay aane par sabhi badi rajnatik partiyaan daliton ko naukariyon or shiksha sansthaanon main zyada aarakshan kaa laalach dekar unhen lubhaane kii koshish karti hai
 Once the elections are over, everything becomes the same again: small-caste Hindus may once again be victims of oppression
 congress or bhaajapa, donon hi jor-shor se daawa karti hai ki ve hinduon main kathith badi jatiyon or daliton ke bich koi fark nahin karatin
 But the reality is that both make a difference
 phir bhi donon partiyon ke vichaaron main ek mahatvapurn fark he
 The study of ancient history tells us that the Aryans invaded India a long time ago and they settled here
 hindutv ke vichaarkon ko yah maananaa acha lagata he ki unhone aaryon ke raktakram ko hajaaron varshon se surakshit rakhaa he
 Golwalkar and his ilk also adopted the false myth of Aryan purity and superiority which was propagated by Hitler and his fascist army
 isliye pradhanmantri narendra modi kii ore se ambedkar kii dharapravaah prashansa ke baavjood aresas or bhaajapa daliton kii avhelnaa karti hai
 It is a paradox that the caste system has been severely criticized within a section of Hindu society (not Hinduism)
 ve purajor tareeke se kehete hai ki dalit kaa label hataakar unhen samaaj main shaamil kiya jaae or unhen shiksha tathaa naukariyon main paryaapt jagah di jaae
 This is the reason why despite all the flaws Hinduism is still the most liberal and inclusive in India
 gandhi ji, nehru, moulana abul kalam aaazaad, vallabhbhai patel, ambedkar or hamaari aazaadee ke andolan ke adhiktar netaaon kii vajah se bharat kaa samvidhan duniya ke is hisse main sabase dharmanirpeksh or udaar he
 But this statement is true only as long as we execute its words and its spirit
 hindu dharm kaa sabase bada gun uskaa samaveshi hona tha
 Its arms were always open to welcome those who came to its shelter or who were associated with it
 bharat main aakar basane waalon main parsi sabase pehle the
 After this some Muslim invaders came here and looted India
 kuch ne to bhayanak narsanhaar bhi kiye
 Despite this, we should not forget that many invaders who settled in this subcontinent ruled here in a fair and gentle manner
 misaal ke liye mughalon ne bahut se maamalon main bharat kaa gaurav badhaayaa
 After this Portuguese Christians came and then the British colonized here for 300 years
 us samay atal bihari vaajapeyi desh ke pehle bhaajapai pradhanmantri the or narendra modi gujarat ke mukhyamantri the jab gujarat main bhayankar dange hue
 According to rough estimates, more than one thousand Muslims were killed in those riots and several thousand Muslims had to leave their homes
 hamen pradhanmantri vaajapeyi kii vah jhidki nahin bhulani chahie jisamen unhone mukhyamantri narendra modi ko naseehat dete hue kaha tha ki ''yah rajdharm nahin he
 "to be fair, Vajpayee's approach to Hindutva was more liberal and his cabinet gave the best experts in his field like Arun Shourie and Yashwant Sinha
 narendra modi ko pradhanmantri bane hue teen saal se zyada samay ho chukaa he
 Despite all the adventurous things, he feels insecure and has placed mediocre people around him in the cabinet
 aresas ke saath unka sambandh na keval zyada khule rup main he, balki hindutv ke atyant aakraamak nae avatar main dikhataa he
 So far there has been no anti-muslim riot in the country, but what is going on with the silent consent of the government is more dangerous
 hamen hameshaa ke liye yah samaj lenaa chahie ki hindutv brigade ke liye bhale hi hamaara samvidhan pavitra nahin he lekin gaay he
 So pious that the poor cow is left hungry on the streets and forced to feed with plastic poison bags while the BJP government has declared cow slaughter and eating beef and its sale a cognizable offense
 isaki vajah se hajaaron musalmaan raturaat apni aajeevika ganvaa chuke hai
 It is necessary to mention here that whatever the citizen of the country eats, it comes under the law of privacy in the constitution
 lekin gaay kii raajnneeti kaa sabase niraashajanak pahalu yah he ki yah hindutv ke bare main hamaari agyanta kaa ek or udhaaharan he, jabaki samskruti, itihaas or puranic granthon main alag hi ullekh miltaa he
 They probably do not know that according to the Vedas, cow was sacrificed in many religious rituals
 sankeern buddhi waalon ke pratik deenanath batra jaise logon ko buddhijivi mana jaataa he or pradhanmantri khud bhi bade garv ke saath bhagwaan ganesh kaa udhaaharan dete hue hamen bataate hai ki hamaare purvaj angon ke transplant kii takanic jaanate the
 Some of the most ardent and knowledgeable scholars of Hindutva have no hesitation in claiming that the Taj Mahal was originally a temple
 yahaan tak ki uparashtrapati venkaiya naidu desh ko luutane, tabah karne or dhokhaa dene kaa aarope lagaate hue mughalon (or angrejon) par barase
 Will anyone tell the Vice President that at the time of the Revolt of 1857 one lakh Brahmin soldiers marched towards Delhi in support of the last Mughal emperor and enshrined him on the throne? However, the ban on beef is nothing but cow politics and An excuse to oppress Muslims and kill them publicly is that they are breaking the law
 tathakthith gorakshak baar-baar nirdosh logon kii hatya kar rahe hai
 Here we take just one example
 rajasthan ke alvar jile main 55 varsh ke pahalu khan kii peet-petakar jaan le lee gai thi jabaki uske paas mili kagajaat bataate hai ki usne vaid tareeke se gaayen kharidi thim

 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kuch saal pehle kai maamalon main abhiyukt the, iske baavjood unhen khud hi apane khilaaf lage aaropon ko waapas lene kii chhot de di gai
 The lesson of this story is one of the benefits of implementing Hinduism: killing the innocent and freeing the guilty and murderers from punishment
 videshi media ne jab in ghatnaon ke bare main sawaal kiya to narendra modi ne badppan dikhaate hue kaha ki musalamaanon kii hatya karne waalon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai kii jaaegi
 But after this the silence remained
 teen saal main hindutv ke sabase bade pratinidhi pradhanmantri ne hamen sikhaaya he ki bhaashan apni jagah he or karrwai apni jagah, donon alag-alag baaten hai
 One of the most dangerous and ultimately self-destructive projects of the Hindutva regime has been that old things are forgotten in a well-thought-out manner
 gandhiji, nehru, moulana abul kalam aaazaad or anya netaa tathaa saadhaaran naagarik, jinhone duniya main pehali baar ahimsa ke hathiyaar se aazaadee kii ladaai ladakar jeet hasil kii thi, ve ''gaayab" ho chuke hai
 Gandhiji is remembered only during a program of "cleanliness" campaign
 main raashtrapati richard won vijasaikars ke us asaadhaaran or budhimaneepurn bhaashan ke anshon ke saath apni baat khatm karata hum jo unhone duusare vishwa yuddh ke ant kii 40veen varshganth ke avasar par diya thah ''yuva or puraani peedhishaan yah samajhane main ek-duusare kii madad kar sakati hai or unhen jarur kerani chahie ki hamaari smritiyon ko jinda rakhana kyon jaruri he
 It is not a matter of correcting the past
 yah sambhav nahin he
 It cannot be changed
 lekin jo ateet kii taraf se ankhen moond letaa he, vartmaan ke prati andhaa ho jaataa he
 Anyone who does not remember the inhumanity of someone can become a victim of infection of new danger

 ' The Congress has sought the resignation of the defense minister, Ministhala Sitharaman, following claims made by former Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) chief Serafel Dealo
 purv kendriya mantri or congress pravaktaa manish tiwari ke mutabik raksha mantri ne buudhvaar ko jo bayaan diya wo bahut pareshaan karne vaala he
 Manish Tiwari said, “the Defense Minister had said that HAL would not contract with Dassault Aviation
 HAL ke purv pramukh jo 2018 main ritair hue, unhone kuch vaazib baaten rakhi hai jinase endie ke daawey dhwast ho jate hai
 Raju, the former head of HAL, has said that a mutual workshop contract was signed between HAL and Dass Aviation and was entrusted to the government
 ”bataa den ki raksha mantrinirmala sitaramanne rafel deal se HAL ke baahar hone ko lekar congress ke netritv vaali pichhali UPA sarkaar ko jimmedaar tehraaya tha
 According to the Minister of Defense, the government company could not agree to Dassault Aviation on the construction conditions of the HAL at the time of the previous government, in such a situation the HAL was out of the deal in the UPA government itself
 manish tiwari ne kaha, “sawaal ye uthta he ki kya raksha mantri ne jaanboojh kar koshish kii or bharat ke logon ko gumraah kiya?”tiwari ne kaha, ‘HAL ke purv pramukh raju ne duusari ahm baat ye kahi he ki HAL kii ore se 108 rafel vimaanon kaa nirmaan kiya ja saktaa tha, agar sarkaar ne aage badhkar contract puraa kiya hota
 We demand the resignation of the Defense Minister on charges of misleading the country
 ’raju ne daawa kiya he ki HAL rafel ladaaku vimaanon ko desh main hi bana saktaa tha, agar centre sarkaar mul swaroop main jo baatcheet thi, usee par barkaraar rahati or daso ke saath workashere contract karti
 On Raju's claims, Tiwari said, "the former head of HAL has also said that the life-cycle price of HAL produced jets would be cheaper than the deal done by the Modi government and India could be self-sufficient in this direction
" unhone ye bhi kaha ki HAL or daso aviation ke bich saare mudde hal ho chuke the
 In such a situation, the efforts made by the NDA government to weave a trap of lies are completely destroyed

 On the other hand, Kabaddi, the carrier of India's ancient sports tradition
 
 
 jo cricket kii chakachaundh ke bich kahin gum hota ja rahaa tha
 But the changing times have brought this game to that place
 jahaan vah cricket ko philhal chunauti detaa hua to nahin, lekin uske saamne khadey hone kii himmat karata hua dikhaai de rahaa he
 If Kabaddi would have challenged cricket ten years ago, then perhaps the question would have been meaningless if Kabaddi would be able to become a big game like cricket
 lekin aaj ye sawaal hairaan nahin karata
 In recent times, the increasing interest of sponsors towards this pure country sport kabaddi and the signals from their side has given the message to the sports giants that now this country-made sport is a tough challenge in front of the shoot booted game
 Emerging in kabddi kii lokapriyata main ijapha hua havebddi kii lokapriyata main haal ke dinon main kaaphi ijapha hua he
 This is one of the reasons why India is a superpower in kabaddi, making it a dazzling game through Pro Kabaddi League is also a big reason
 is desh main vishwa vijetaon kii behad kami he
 In such a situation, the feeling of world winner through Kabaddi makes people feel like being the head of the world
 us ehsaas ke saath jab chakachaundh kaa mail hota he baat dil ko chhu jaati he
 When the sponsors, who kept a close watch on people's interest, noticed that the interest of people outside of cricket is now increasing towards kabaddi, they have started investing in this game too
 khelon main bad rahe praayokek samay tha jab desh main kheloge kudoge hoogo kharaab, padhoge likhoge banoge nabaav vaali kahawat haaavee thi
 But with the passage of time and with the change in environment regarding sports, this situation has also changed
 kuch samay pehle tak khel or khilaadiyon ko praayojak badi mushkil se milte the
 But now the former is no more
 ye sach he ki aaj bhi praayojakon kii kami he, lekin doosraa sach ye bhi he ki har saal khelon main adhik paisa bhi aa rahaa he
 If we compare only the last two years, then this difference is clearly visible
 saal 2015 main khelon ke bazaar main 2014 kii tulana main 12
 Saw a 3 per cent increase and market 5185
 4 karod ho gaya
 794 of the ground sponsorship in 2014
 8 karod thi or 2015 main badhkar 1030

 yani ek saal main ye 29
 Gained 7

 In the year 2014 where 327 on endorsement

 1 fisadi kaa ijapha dekhne ko mila
 a similar increase was seen in on air broadcasts
 2014 main on air 2518 karod rupye kharch hue the to 2015 main yah 6
 It rose 8 percent to 2690 crore rupees
 frencchiji sponsrashipafrenchziji sponsership kii baat karen to 2014 main 482
 3 crores
 or 2015 main 1
 490 with an increase of 7 per cent
 3 karod hua
 Kabaddi became hot cakes for the sponsors, so there was talk of all sports and its sponsors
 lekin in khelon ke bich jis khel ne praayojakon ko sabase zyada aakarshith kiya he wo bhartiya khel premiyon kaa junun cricket yaa duniya kaa sabase lokapriy khel footbal nahin balki deshi mitti se sanaa khel kabddi he
 464 of 2014 where in cricket
 7 karod kii tulana main 2015 main 529
 An amount of 5 crores came while 59 in football
 5 karod kii tulana main 2015 main 114 karod rupye aae
 69 crore compared to 45 crore in marathon and 35 in tennis
 6 karod kii tulana main 47 karod kii raashi ai
 But the real miracle happened in Kabaddi, in which Rs 48 crore was imposed in 2015 as against Rs 12 crore in 2014
 anya khelon main 178 karod se badhkar raashi 223 karod tak pahunch gai
 These figures show that the percentage of cricket games has increased in terms of percentage
 cricket se agar tulana karen to 2014 se 2015 ke bich jentalman game main jahaan sabase kam 13
 There was an increase of 9 percent, while Kabaddi saw an incredible 300 percent increase
 haalanki cricket ke 539
 The amount of 48 crores appears negligible as against 5 crores
 alag-alag sector kii bhi kabddi main badi ruchivaise alag-alag kshetra kii companio kii khelon main ruchi dekhen to sheersh paanch kshetra kii companiyon kaa rujhaan bhi kabddi main zyada najar aata he
 The mobile hand set companies have 13 teams in the Indian Premier League
 5 fisadi kaa nivesh kiya to telecom companiyon ne 11 fisadi paise lagaae
 Consumer durable companies 10
 6 to real state companiyon ne apane khel bajet kaa 9
 Applied 7% of the money
 anya companiyon ne 48
 Invested 5 percent of the money
 footbal ke indian super lig main real state companiyon ne sabase adhik 15
 Financial Service Providers 13 while budget was 2%

 E-commerce 12

 Applied 5 percent sports budget
 airlines companiyon kaa yogadan 6

 kabddi milaayegaa cricket se ankhyab baari kabddi kii, teji se ubharate pro kabddi lig main emmemasiji companiyon ne sabase adhik 31
 6 percent budgeted
 real state companiyaan 13
 Ranked second with 8 percent
 vittiya seva pradaata companiyon ne 10
 6 percent of the energy sector companies 9
 4 fisadi paise lagaae
 Mixed contribution of other sector companies 34
 8 fisadi rahaa
 If all these figures and the changing trend of the wind on the sports field are any indication, then it is here that cricket has reached its peak
 ab aage uske liye rasta sikudta ja rahaa he or sambhaavnaaen kam hoti ja rahi hai
 But for kabaddi, it is like open sky
 uske liye sambhaavnaaon kaa dwaar khulaa hua he
 Perhaps the day is not far when the country sports Kabaddi, which came from England, can be seen in the eyes of the game cricket and on the people's tongue, not only the name of cricket stars but also the name of Kabaddi star

 sushamaa ne kaha ki agar sarkaar main ichhashakti ho to ise phir se svachh jal se labalab kiya ja saktaa he

 unhone kaha ki madhya pradesh main bhi kshipraa nadi ko narmada se joda ja rahaa he
 Sushma questioned the government that despite spending so much money, neither the flow of water in the Yamuna river increased nor did the pollution decrease

 desh main aadhaar card kii suraksha ko lekar log kaaphi chintit hai, unhen yah dar sata rahaa he ki iske jariye kisi bhi naagarik se judi sari jaankaree hasil kii ja sakati he, haalanki duniya ke kai anya deshon main bhi photo aadhaarit pahchaan patr chalan main he or iske jariye sarkaar or logon ke bich sampark bana rahata he
 Unlike Aadhaar cards, passports and driving licenses are the most accepted photo identity cards in many developed countries of the world
 lekin apane desh kaa aadhaar card in sab cardon se behad alag he
 Let's take a look at the world of cards
 
 
 france se card kii shuruyatpahchaan patr kii parampara duniya main bahut puraani nahin he
 The history related to this started about a quarter to two hundred years ago
 1803-04 main france aadhunik duniya kaa pehla aisa desh bana jisane apane nagarikon ke liye pahchaan patr kii shuruyaat kii
 Cards were also issued in Napoleon's time, but then the aim was to monitor the antics of working people and pay them low wages
 naukari ke dauraan karmchaaree ko apana card niyokta ko dena hota tha or naukari badale jane kii surat main yah card unase le lenaa hota tha
 But taking this card from any employer was not so easy
 SC ne upi sarkaar se poocha- bina aadhaar vaale begharon kaa astitv nahin?1839 main turki main otoman samrajya ke sultan mahamud-ii ne apane desh main anya europea shaktiyon ke badhate akraman or hastkshep ko dekhte hue rashtriya str par aadhaarit pahchaan patr jari kiya, jisase bahari logon par ankush lagaaya ja sake
 At the beginning of the Second World War in 1938, England and Germany made identity cards mandatory for their citizens
 1940 main france ne bhi ise apane yahaan lagu kiya
 Germany and France issued cards to make it easier for Jews to be identified and targeted
 england ne yuddh ke baad card vyavastha ko khatm nahin karne or ise jari rakhane kaa elaan kiya
 Nilekani, who defended the base, chanted the campaign to discredit Hong Kong and Taiwan in 1949, after the Second World War, introduced identification cards to identify people from China who came to its territory
 1958 main china ne hukou registration regulation kii shuruyaat kii jiske jariye besahaara logon ko zarurat kii chijen muhaiyaa karai ja sake, saath hi un par desh ke khilaaf sambhavit andolan par ankush lagaaya ja sake
 In the 1960s, South Korea and Singapore also introduced national identity cards
 aaj ke halaataj halaat hadal chuke hai or duniya kaaphi choti ho gai hai
 But the identity card has become very important in terms of security and other things
 ek najar daalate hai ki aaj kis tarah se logon kii pahchaan kii jaati he
 Australia: In 1987 and 2007, 2 such proposals have been rejected citing private security
 yahaan driving license, tex file number or medicare number ko pahchaan patr ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Russia: Citizens whose age is above 14 years and who want to stay in Russia have to get an internal passport
 ise 20 or 45 saal kii aayu par navinikaran bhi karana hota he
 China: Citizens above 16 years of age are required to apply for a housing identity card
 japanad maai number lau (2013) apane har nagarikon ko ek number detaa he jisamen uski tex sambandhi, saamaajik suraksha sambandhi or centre tathaa sthaneey sarkaron kii ore se milane vaali aapadaa raahat se judi nijee jaankariyaan hoti hai
 England: The Identity Card Act 2006 was abolished after the arrival of the Identity Documents Act 2010
 is documents main driving license, passport, aayu pramanit card jaisi jaankariyaan hoti hai
 America: There is no national card system in the country
 pahchaan patr ke rup main driving license, passport, soshal sicurity card, state ycard, military siesi card kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 France: Nationally, through identity cards, you can roam all over Europe and countries under the colonial rule of France, as well as open a bank account
 germanyapahchaan patr yaa passport donon main se ek anivaary he, lekin naagarik is baat ko lekar swatantra hai ki apane pahchaan patr main finger print shaamil karaaen yaa nahin

 In it, photographs of every citizen, 10 fingerprints of the hand and the pupil of the eyes are drawn
 iske jariye aam logon ko sabhi sarkari suvidhaon, bank khaataa or anya jaruri jaankaree shaamil hoti he
 In France, the Center's database was criticized by a state for exploiting people

 com / bzeutyzfwi BJP has suffered a crushing defeat in the assembly elections of five states of the country
 chhattisgarh or rajasthan main bijepi ko jahaan satta ganvaani padi he, vahiin empi main bhi maamla kaante kaa chal rahaa
 In Telangana, the BJP was hoping to become a kingmaker, but the party suffered a major setback
 rajya main bijepi paanch siton se ghatakar 1 seat par simat gai
 In the 119-seat assembly in Telangana, the BJP was completely wiped out by the KCR tsunami
 haalanki bijepi ne camel khilaane ke liye harsambhav koshish main juty thi
 From Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP President Amit Shah to UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath campaigned fiercely
 2014 main bane telugana rajya kii siyasat main tiares ek majboot kile kii tarah najar aa rahi he
 The way KCR has expanded its party and organization in five years
 wo chunavi nattejey main bhi tabdeel hue he
 While Congress and other parties including BJP have suffered heavy losses
 bijepi ne telugana main 20 se zyada siten jeetne kaa lakshya rakhaa tha
 But instead of touching this figure, it could not maintain its old record
 party ke paas pehle 5 vidhayak the, lekin ab ye sankhya ghatakar ek ho gai he
 In the Telangana Assembly elections, TRS returned to power for the second time with 88 seats with a two-thirds majority
 vahiin, congress ko 19, asaduddin ovaisi kii party AIMIM ko 7 or tidipi ko 2 anya ko 3 siten milti dikh rahi hai
 The country whose system does not have accountability in its thinking, the country whose system does not care about the lives of citizens
 jis desh kaa system bade-bade haadason ke baad bhi khud ko bachaane main kaamyaab ho jaae, us zero javabdehi vaale system se new india kaise banaaya ja saktaa he
 Because in the last 15 days, the country has seen two such accidents, which can not be called an accident but a cruel crime of our system
 shanivaar ko utkal train haadasa iskaa letest udhaaharan he, jahaan tutaa railway trek chhodkar 100 kilometre kii speed se train dauda di gai or is laaparvaahee ne 22 logon kii jaan le lee
 More than 150 lives were saved
 sach ye to he ki ham par raham thi ki maut kaa aankada 22 hi rahaa
 Otherwise our system had left no stone unturned, which did not care about the lives of the people
 aisi afasarshahi apradhi he
 But the regret is that responsibility and accountability are not fixed
 vahiin gorakhpur main system kii laaparvaahee kii vajah se haftebhar main 60 se zyada bacchon kii maut ho gai or phir jaanch ke naam par cameti bana di gai
 Action has been taken on 8 officers in Utkal Rail Accident
 lekin suspend, transfar or live par bhejne se hi baat nahin banegi, kyonki aise log phir system main aa jaaenge
 No one can spoil them
 sab chalata he, se agar sab badalata he, ki soch lani he to aise apradhi system ko sazaa dena zaruri he, nahin to har naaraa har slogan khokhla sabit hoga, jaisaa ki ab tak hota chalaa aayaa he
 The slogan from New India sounds good
 sab chalata he se sab badal saktaa he kii soch zaruri bhi he
 But can New India be built till then? jab tak us system ko zero javabdehi vaali aadat lagi he, jiske liye desh ke nagarikon kii jaan kii koi keemat nahin
 There is no honor
 ye gorakhpur main bacchon kii maut se lekar muzaffarnagar main train haadase tak sab dekh rahe hai
 The train accident in Khatauli going from Puri in Haridwar to Odisha Express would not have happened
 agar is system ko logon kii jaan kii zaraa-si bhi parvaah hoti
 22 people lost their lives, 156 people lost their lives
 tuuti patari par 100 kilometre prati ghanta kii speed se train daud rahi thi- railway trek par marammat kaa kaam chal rahaa tha, adhikari aankh moond kar baithe the
 - Staff officers disappeared without welding after cutting tracks
 - stesan master ko pataa nahin tha ki 700 meter aage trek khulaa padaa he
 - Railway staff stood on the platform with the green signal, and the train left at full speed
 - aage haadasa taiyaar tha, 23 dibbon main 13 dibbe direl hue, 6 dibbon kii buree haalat thi
 1 box then entered into a nearby house
 ye to raham thi ki 22 log hi shikaar hue, varanaa system ne isse bhi zyaada kaa aankada banane main kami kya chodi thi
 The work of saving people continued
 lekin khud ko bachaane kaa kaam railway ne pehle hi shuru kar diya
 When on track they were not agreeing to work, without any accountability, they tried to save everyone
 lekin har baar yahi hota rahegaa
 This habit of the system that makes fun of death should start with injury
 - utkal train haadase main railway ne praathmik jaanch ke baad 8 adhikariyon par ection liya he
 For the first time, the Railway Board officer of the Secretary level was suspended on such an accident
 - aise teen top level ke adhikariyon ko chuttee par bhej diya gaya
 - Which includes Member Engineer of Railway Board, General Manager of Northern Railway, Divisional Manager
 - iske alaava assistant ejeeniyar meerut, section ejeeniyar mujffarnagar, junior ejeeniyar khatauli ko suspend kiya gaya
 - Chief track engineer has been transferred
 system kii javabdehi aise kade ection se hi tay hogi, or agar ye javabdehi tay nahin hoti to phir chaahe sarkarein badal jaaen
 Anyone can come
 aisi laaparvaahiyaan nahin rukengi
 Such accidents will not stop and such non-accountable thinking will never create a new India
 ye baat zarur he ki jitna bada rail system he, us hisaab se hamaare yahaan haadase phir bhi antarrashtriya trek record ke hisaab se kuch hi zyaada hai
 But the thing is about Mission Zero Accident
 aisa system banane kii he jahaan ek bhi haadasa naa ho, aisa system banane kii he, jahaan haadase ke jimmedaar batch naa saken
 To avoid political criticism, we will keep trying to cover our shortcomings
 jimmedaar log haadason ke baad bhi bache rahenge
 Until then the system is very difficult to fix
 yahi vajah he ki hamen rail haadason kii aadat-si ho gai he
 There have been 586 railway accidents in the last 5 years, of which 53 percent were due to derail
 - direlment kii vajah se november 2014 ke baad se chote-bade kareeb 20 train haadase ho chuke hai
 - The Railway Ministry has claimed that there has been a decrease in train accident in the last 3 years
 - 2014-15 main 135 haadase hue, jo 2015-16 main 107 or 2016-17 main 104 rah gaye
 - Ministry of Railways claims that 759 accidents took place in three years of UPA-1, 938 in three years of UPA-2 and 652 in three years of Modi government
 - mantralay kaa daawa he ki trek sudhaarney se lekar ditection system banane or tackarrodhi coach lagane tak ke suraksha upaay kiye ja rahe hai
 - In last year's budget, Mission Zero Accident was mentioned in which two aspects are being worked out, with the focus being to completely remove unmanned level crossings by 2020 and to avoid collision derailment
 - agle paanch saal main sefti feechar se las 40 hazaar Linke Hofmann Busch coach se railway ko las karne kii baat he
 As in the death of children in Gorakhpur, where action was taken only at the hospital level
 jaisaa ki utkal train haadase main shuruyaat main haadase kii vajah par paradaa daalane kii naakaam koshish kii gai
 Only then can the system be made accountable
 jab laaparvaahee or andekhi se hone vaale nagarikon ke saath system ke aparaadh ko chupaaya naa jaae
 Those responsible for protecting themselves from criticism should not be saved
 maaruti ke manesar plant main karmchaaree prabandhan vivaad gaharaa gaya he
 The workers at the Manesar plant, who are on strike against the management, have got the support of the employees of the plant on three sides of Suzuki
 manesar plant ke saath ab sujuki powertrain privet limited sujuki, casting plant or sujuki motor cycle privet limited ke kareeb aath hajaar kamarchaari bhi bemiyadi hadtaal main shaamil ho gaye hai
 These three plants are Maruti Suzuki's vendor plants from where the company's Gurgaon and Manesar plants supply engines and spare parts
 karmchaariyon ke is rukh ko dekhte hue company ne apane gudgaanv plant ko band rakhane kaa faisla kiya he
 After the workers' strike, work is expected to come to a standstill in the rest of the company's plants
 darjeeling main ek baar phir hinsa bhadak gai he
 Here, fierce protesters of Gorkha Janmukti Morcha attacked an officer of Indian Reserve Battalion (IRB) in Khukri, in which they were badly injured
 inaki pahchaan kiran tamang ke rup main kii gai he, jo aiarabi ke 2nd batalian main assistant commander hai
 At the same time West Bengal CM Mamta Banerjee held a meeting with police officers on the situation in Darjeeling
 peedblyoody daftar ko bhi phoonk diya gaya
 Mamta blamed the GJM for the violence
 kai jagahon par jijeem samarthakon or police ke bich jhadap kii khabaren hai
 Isharamamata Banerjee of political conspiracy blamed the GJM for the violence and said that these people were silent for five years and seeing the election close, the violence was conspired
 mamata banerjee ne logon ne shanti kii apil kii
 Pointing to the conspiracy, Mamta Banerjee said where did the arms of the GJM leaders come from? Mamta Banerjee said that earlier, on Saturday, the gjm's Mahila Morcha took out a big rally
 mamata banerjee ne kaha ki adaalat ne jijeem ke protest ko avaidh qaraar diya ve adaalat kii baat bhi nahin maan rahe
 All that is happening in Darjeeling is hooliganism
 gauratlab he ki gorkha janamukti morcha (jijeem) dwaara aahut anischitkaaleen band shanivaar ko chathe din bhi jari he, jiske chalate uttari pashchim bengal ke pahari kshetron main tanaav kii sthiti bani hui he
 The turmoil between the ruling Trinamool Congress and the GJM of the state has led to unrest in the Darjeeling litigants
 jijeem ke sahaayak mahasachiv binay tamang ne daawa kiya ki police or trinmul congress ke kaaryakartaaon ne shuukravaar raat kareeb teen baje unke ghar main bhi usee prakaar chhapemari or todphod kii, jaise do din pehle unhone party pramukh bimal gurang ke ghar par kii thi
 Tamang also claimed that the police have also arrested the son of Amar Rai, GJM MLA
 amar raay kaa kahana he ki unke bete kaa raajnneeti se koi lenadena nahin he
 At the same time, Trinamool Congress worker Devraj Gurung claimed that GJM supporters threw stones at his residence on Lebong Kart Road and threw petrol bombs

 aglaa loksabhaa chunaav pradhanmantri narendra modi ke chehre par hi ladaa jayega
 During this, he has given a slogan of 73 plus, encouraging the party workers and leaders
 bijepi adhyaksh ne kaha, 'log poochhate hai ki sapa-basapa ek ho gayi, to kya hoga
 i say that we have defeated SP, BSP and Congress all together in Uttar Pradesh
 jab saal 2017 main ham chunaav lade the, to do ladakon ne haath milaayaa tha, lekin hamane 300 se adhik siten jiti
 This time we will win not less than 74 seats, even if all three are found

 They say that if you go to speak to the sarpanch, you get the answer that do not come here for water or else a false accusation will be made
 mehta ke mutabik colector se bhi is maamle main do baar guhaar laga chuke hai
 On the other hand, his representative and son Rahul More, on behalf of Sarpanch Suman More, call the allegations of not giving water baseless
 unka kahana he ki kisi tarah kaa bhedbhaav nahin kiya ja rahaa
 Many people are taking water from a separate line

 is mudde par janpanchayatkhargonke siio rajendra sharma se sampark kiya gaya to unka kahana tha ki gaanv main pani kii supplai ke liye prastaav de diya he
 Some people had connected the main line, which has been spoken to be cut

 Rahul Gandhi did not refrain from doing politics from Janau to Gotra
 rahul ke paripakv hone par jahaan ek ore bharat kii janata ke bheetar ummid jaagi to duusari ore kahin na kahin ek dar bhi gaharaaya he
 Democracy is successful only when there is more than one option to choose before the public
 piem modi kii tsunami ko chunauti milani behad jaruri thi
 So, if we see other than dynastic politics, strengthening the heirs of the oldest and the largest party in the country is auspicious sign
 lekin dar is baat kaa he ki dharm kii raajnneeti karne vaali bhaajapa ko chunauti dete-dete kahin rahul khud bhi to nahin dharm kii raajnneeti karne lage hai? kai baar pratidwandi ko haraane ke chakkar main ham usko usee kii chaalon se parrast karte hai
 Till the defeat is fine, but if Rahul Gandhi gets addicted to the politics of religion, then the face will not change for the people but only because the idea will continue to prevail over power
 rahul ne is bich bhaajapa ko kai baar unke achook astr dharm se hi parrast kiya
 The monastery, the gotra, the janeu used everything
 rahul gandhi ko bulle shah kii ye line jarur padhani chahie or saavdhaanee purvak vichaar bhi karnaa chahie
 'ranjha ranjha kardi ni, i am your Ranjha
 ranjha main vicch main raanjhe vicch, hor khyaal naa koi
 'that is, while doing ranjha-ranjha, Heer herself became Ranjha

 It is okay for positive thoughts to dissolve into each other
 lekin bhaajapa-bhaajapa karte hue khud rahul kaa bhaajapa ho janaa desh kii sehat ke liye khatarnaak he

 He said, 'bharatiya Janata Party, Prime Minister and Home Minister should clarify whether they are with Gandhi or with Godse? Gandhi in the mouth and Godse in the heart will not work
 gandhi ke desh main godse mahimamandit nahin ho saktaa'
 He further said, 'being an ostrich will not work
 narendra modi ji or amit shah ji saamne aakar pragna thakur ke bayaan par desh ke samaksh apana rukh spasht karen
 They should tell in front of the country what they have in mind about Godse, the killer of Gandhi
 'shuturamurg banane se kaam nahin chalegaa
 Narendra Modi ji and Amit Shah ji come forward and make clear their stand before the country on the statement of Pragya Thakur

 'earlier, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was also targeted
 unhone likhaa, 'desh kii sansad main khadey hokar bhaajapa kii ek saansad ne godse ko deshbhakt bol hi diya
 Now the Prime Minister (who celebrated Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary with great pomp) is requested to tell from the heart what his thoughts are about Godse? Mahatma Gandhi is immortal '

 Now the Prime Minister (who celebrated Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary grandly) is requested to tell from the heart what his views are about Godse? mahatma gandhi amar hai
 At the same time, Rahul Gandhi also targeted Pragya Thakur, describing it as a sad day in the history of Parliament
 aapako bataa den ki bhaajapa ke kaaryakari adhyaksh je pi nadda or rakshaamantri rajnath singh ne thakur ke bayaan ko nindaneey bataaya he

 The eight-month-old deadlock came to an end when the agreement reached that three-year-old Abhigyan and his one-year-old sister Aishwarya would be handed over to their uncle Arunabhash, who lives in Kolkata
 arunabhash ne kaha, ‘main media kaa dhanyavad karata hum
 i have not seen the agreement and the terms
 ’ unhone kaha ki vah bacchon ko waapas laaenge
 Children's maternal grandfather Ajay Bhattacharya also expressed happiness at the news of the agreement
 bhavuk ajay ne kaha, ‘main kaaphi khush hum

 The story of Jamshedpur's glorious past when Tata laid the foundation of the steel plant to Palestine, the strength of Jharkhand is more than 100 years old
 saal 1914 tha or pehle vishwa yuddh main topein garaj rahi thim
 The British government was badly involved in war with germany-austria and Hungary
 aadhunik vishwa kaa pehla yuddh europe, africa or madhya purv tak fail chukaa tha
 The British government was supplying large scale logistics and munitions to its soldiers spread all over the world
 jis british samrajya kaa surya kabhi ast nahin hota tha, uskaa is mahayuddh main sab kuch daanv par laga hua tha
 The transport system then was not as well as it is today
 puraane model ke railway se saamaan bheje jate the
 There were no railway tracks even in the deserts of Egypt, Mesopotamia and East Africa
 lekin vahaan yuddh kii garmi teji se bad rahi thi
 The British rule had to reach there first and fastest to maintain its hold in these areas
 iske liye angrej ejiniyaron ne in ilaakon main rail patariyaan bichaane kii yojana banaai
 Work has also started
 lekin turant unhen ek gambhir baadha kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Britain, trapped in the war, could not produce enough steel to make rail rails
 ladaai jari thi, lekin patariyaan bichaane kaa kaam rukne laga tha
 The steel steel was being built in Jharkhand, on the occasion, the British government caught sight of its colony India
 un dinon avibhajit bihar (ab jharkhand) ke ghaney jangalon main ek steel kaarkaana nayaa-nayaa shuru hua tha
 At that time, cast iron hidden in the gemstone earth of the forests of Chotanagpur was being melted and made of steel of the world's best quality
 ye kaarkaana thajamshedjinauseravaan ji tata kaa or kaarkaane kaa naam tha tata aayran and steel company limited (TISCO)
 India was a British colony at the time
 britain ne apni sharton par TISCO ke maalik jamshedji tata ke bete doraab ji tata se steel kharidne kaa sauda kiya
 These were the same British who were not giving Jamsetji a license for this steel plant, and used to make fun of Jamshedji for this dream
 ek angrej adhikari ne to yahaan tak kaha tha kitatajitna ton steel paidaa karenge unhen khud hi khaanaa padegaa
 In fact, this slave was a comment of an Englishman immersed in pride on the bad industrial picture of India
 jubilee park main sthit jamshedji kii pratimaa (photo-jamshedpur nic)3 lakh ton steel, or 2500 KM rail patariyaanphilhal is kaarkaane se utpaadan hone vaala sara steel britain bheja jane laga
 Between 1914 and 1918, 3 lakh tonnes of steel and rail tracks of up to 2500 km were supplied from this factory
 britain ne apane sainya abhiyaanon menjharkhandki is kharij sampada kaa nirdayata se istemaal kiya
 Britain laid rail tracks in far-flung areas of East Africa, Mesopotamia, Palestine and Egypt, and served its purpose of imperialism

 Addressing the company's officials from the bungalow of Tata Steel, based in Sakchi, he said, "I can hardly imagine that if the Tata company had not given us steel for Mesopotamia, Egypt, Palestine and East Africa" So what would have happened
 " isi dauraan ek kaarykram main unhone is shahar kaa naam sakachi se badalakar desh ke mahaan udyogpati jamshedji nauseravaan ji tata ke naam par jamshedpur rakhaa
 100 years ago, the famous railway station of eastern India was known as Tatanagar Kalimati
 lord chamsford ne hi iskaa namakaran tatanagar kiya
 Tata's journey of more than 100 years was established in 1907, but for the first time steel was produced from here on 16 February 1912
 tab bharat asia kaa ekmaatr aisa desh tha, jisaki apni steel factory thi
 In today's perspective, even if it seems very small, but even then China and Japan did not have this status

 lekin tab tak duniya ek baar phir se yuddh ke muhane par aa chuki thi
 Friends and enemies had changed on the stage of war and were ready to destroy humanity with new tools and weapons
 1939 main hi dwitiya vishwa yuddh kii ghoshnaa ho gai

 Protests continue in beete din jamiya millia islamia main maamle ne tab tool pakad liya, jab police ne chaatro par lathicharge kar barbarta dikhaai
 Apart from Jamia, there was a strong demonstration of students at Lucknow's Darul Uloom Nadwatul University

 However, the situation is now being told as normal
 unka korporate kariyar badhibia chal rahaa tha
 She was working as a project manager in an IT company
 lekin unka iraadaa kuch nayaa karne kaa tha
 So he made up his mind to go to the same industry where his two brothers are earning a name
 ham baat kar rahe hai anubhuti kashyap kii
 "despite my brothers (anurag Kashyap and Abhinav Kashyap) being in films, i never imagined that i would be a part of this industry," she says
 maine anuraag se kuch samay saath bitaane ke liye kaha

 On the other hand, the career of Huma Qureshi and his brother Saqib Saleem, who started a career with Gangs of Wasseypur (2012), is also flourishing with every day in Bollywood
 saaqib 2012 main mujhase friendship karoge ke saath bollywood main aae the or haal hi main unki bombai tokies relies hui jisamen unhone randeep “hooda ko kis bhi kiya tha

 If we look at the relationships formed in Bollywood, then there are many types of equations in them

 vaise bhi yah maanviya swabhaav rahaa he ki vah apane karibiyon ko hi aage badhaata he
 Then in a country where families are dominated from politics to industry, then how can Mayalok remain untouched in such a situation
 or darshak bhi in sitaron ko hathohath lene se peeche nahin rahete
 However, the new generation of Bollywood is a little different in terms of familyism
 ye log apane sarnem nahin balki tallent ke dam par chhap chhodia chaahate hai
 That's why Anubhuti says, "both of my brothers liked Moi Marjani

 Those who sow in the country the poison of love jihad is now coming in the form of sholas
 rajasthan ke rajsamand main ek shaks ko lav jehad ke naam par pehle maaraa, phir kaata or uske baad zindaa jala diya
 The extent is that after this the murderer does not hide
 balki puri vaardaat kaa video soshal media par daal detaa he or wo bhi nafrat bhare bhaashan ke saath
 While recording the video, he was getting his partner to record it live
 maamle kii lipapoti karne vaali police kii ankhen jab viral video ne kholin to ab police foole haath-paanv se us kaatil kaa sach talash rahi he
 In Love, the video Jehadjo which went viral in which every single person is brutally beating a innocent person, cutting them and burning them alive
 wo jagah puraa hindustan nahin he, ho bhi nahin sakati
 Those pictures are not even a picture of India, it cannot be
 magar us marane vaale kii cheekh hindustan kii zarur he
 Just understand that India is screaming
 jin logon ne lav main jehad ghol kar use lav jehad kaa naam diya or phir usee mohabbat ko nafrat ke saath siyasat kaa hissaa bana diya ye jalati hui maut un sabaki he
 The murderer is doing only his job
 kaatil ne banaaya vaardaat kaa videoqatil video main katl karne ke baad kahata he 'jihadiyon ye tumhaari haalat hogi, lav jihad failaao hamaare desh main
 The condition of every jihadis will be like this
 jehad khatm kar do
 The rest will be the condition of every jihadi
 ' kaatil viral video main saaf kahata dikh rahaa he 'jihadiyon hamaare desh se hat jaao
 This will be your result
 jehad puure bharat se hataa do
 Otherwise, every Indian stands by choosing one
 aise maar degaa
 See this your result 'lav jehad ke naam par khaufnak katlapuri kahani aap jaane isse pehle aapako bataa den ki jis shaks ko maaraa or jalaayaa gaya, uskaa naam mohammad bhatta shaikh he
 Wear a scarlet shirt that is killing and burning mercilessly, it is Shambhunath Ragger
 us darinde ne yah sab kuch sirf lav jehad ke naam par kiya
 Conspiracy in the slaughter of humanity is not a new thing, nor any new crime
 dhokhe, laalach or yahaan tak ki ek hi gotra yaa birdari main shaadi tak ko lekar khun-kharaba hua
 Were murdered katle aam hua
 Honor killing occurred
 magar shaadiyon ko jaise hi lav jehad kaa joda pehanaanaa shuru kiya gaya mohabbat or raajnneeti donon ke maahone badal gaye
 It is not that Love Jihad is false at all
 kuch kattar or gumraah naujavaanon ne jarur aisa kiya hoga
 But what humanness is it to burn alive pyre by looking at every love through the spectacles of Jihad? in tasveeron ko saamne laana vaala bhi koi or nahin balki khud kaatil darinda shambhunath raigar he
 After this murder, these pictures were put on social media
 katl kii sajeeshais katl ko puri planning ke saath anjaam diya gaya tha
 At the time, there were three people on the spot
 ek shaikh, doosraa shambhunath or teesraa wo shaks jo khud camere par nahin he kyonki wo is vaardaat kii video bana rahaa he
 Asked before dying- What is my fault, the viral video shows that Sheikh was walking forward in a secluded place
 tabhi peeche se achaanak shambhunath dhardhar hathizaar se achaanak shaikh par hamalaa kar detaa he
 Sheikh begins to falter
 magar phir sanbhalta he or bhaagane kii koshish karata he
 But it does not succeed and falls on the ground
 or shanbhu se baqayada se poochta he ki uskaa kusur kya he
 Why is he killing him? Hit, cut and lit with petrol, but Shambhu had blood on his head
 wo lav jihadiyon ko dhamkee detaa he or phir se shaikh kii taraf lautataa he ab wo jameen par pade shaikh par ek ke baad ek kai or waar karata he
 After this, by putting petrol in the end, he burns the injured Sheikh
 thane ke paas khaufnak vaardatjis jagah ye vaardaat hui vahaan se rajnagar thane kii kotwali koi zyada dur nahin thi
 But the police do not seem to know about it
 jab kisi tarah khabar milti bhi he to police maamle ko kisi tarah rafa dfa karne main lag jaati he
 The matter would have been subdued
 magar kaatil ne phir khud hi video soshal media par daal diya or ye viral ho gaya
 Then the policeman swung his arms and remembered his duty
 jal gai insaaniyatbad main giraftaar se pehle kaatil shanbhu ne ek or video soshal media par daalaa
 In which he says to surrender
 ab police shanbhu kaa itihaas khangaal rahi he
 Her relationships with parties or organizations are being explored
 maaloom nahin aage wo uskaa kya karegi? magar aag kii in lapaton main bahut kuch jal gaya

 In an ongoing hearing in the Supreme Court, the counsel for petitioner Jagdish Narayan Shukla said that there are around 1200 pages of documents against the former minister, which took the UP government more than three years to read and examine
 yachikakarta ke vakil emasi dingra ne shuukravaar ko court se upi sarkaar kii states report par jawaab dene ke liye chaar hafton kaa vakt liya he
 While filing the status report, the UP government has said that the vigilance department is constantly investigating the report of Kilokayukta

 yadi sibiai jaanch hogi to is bhrashtachar se jude kai safedposh log bhi sibiai jaanch main saamne aa sakate hai

 Rajasthan has always wooed tourists, whether it is the experience of royalty or enjoying ancient heritage, forts, havelis, sand dunes or jungle safaris
 aazaadee se pehle rajgharaanon ne sailaaniyon ke liye buniyadi dhaancha muhaiyaa karne kaa bidaa uthaa rakhaa tha
 After the 1950s, the famous Rambagh Palace, then Udaipur's Lake Palace and Laxmi Niwas Palace started
 1970 se jodhpur main sailaaniyon ne pehle-pahal udhyam ke taur par ajit bhawan kii mejabani kaa lutf uthaaya
 Before that there used to be railway guest houses for tourists
 jaipur main bisaau house, khetadi house, hind kesari vagairah thaharne kii kuch or jagahen hua karti thim
 This created opportunities for the rise of hotels in the state
 bhim singh kii aguai main rajasthan turs 1960 tak vajood main aayaa or usne sailaaniyon ko thaharne kii jagah or yatra ke intjaam kii sahuliyatein muhaiyaa kin
 The development of hotels in Rajasthan can be broadly divided into the pre and post 1970 era
 sabase pehle clamsr samooh ne padaarpan kiya
 He was hired by a group in 1972 at the Klamser Amer Hotel
 uske fouran baad taj samooh ne pehle jaipur ke rambagh pales or phir lake pales ko chalaane kii jimmedaari lee
 ITC Hotels signed an agreement with Jaipur's new hotel Man Singh in 1980 and then took over the management of the grand Umaid Bhawan Palace
 oberoi ko pehle trident hotel kii or phir vilaas kii jimmedaari saunpi gai
 The tourism department started functioning from 1960
 paryaton vibhaag ke aankadon ke mutabik, 1990 main 17 lakh videshi sailaani bharat aae, jo 2013 aate-aate 68 lakh ho gaye
 After that the count crossed 70 lakhs
 inamen se 20 se 28 fisadi har saal rajasthan aae or ausatan 2 raat yahaan tehre
 The arrival of tourists increased at a rate of 23 to 26 per cent CAGR (compound Annual Growth Rate)
 tamaam vargeekrut or avargeekrut hotalon ko milakar 2001 main yahaan kul 19,000 kamare maujuud the
 The gap between demand and supply encouraged the entry of big players into this business
 rajya sarkaar ne aisi nitiyaan banaain, jinase sanchaalak hotel sthapit karne yaa gathjod ke liye protsaahit hue
 In the crowded season, royal tents were installed at places like Jaisalmer and Pushkar

 a council of royalty was formed
 isane kilon, mehalon or haweliyon ko bataur hotel istemaal kaa rasta saaf kiya
 This not only started generating revenue from assets, but also created employment for the local people
 aaj pradesh main 160 se zyada heritj bhawan hotel ke taur par istemaal ho rahe hai
 After the year 2000, the cities here have attracted international hotel brands
 ve yaa to saajha udhyam sthapit karne ke liye aage aae yaa prabandhan ke samjhaute kiye
 Today the state has more than 55,000 rooms and 4,000 more are getting ready

 chukaane padate the
 Today ADR is down by 40%

 This includes setting up marketing and marts to increase tourist arrivals and provide immediate temporary relief in taxes to overcome these difficulties
 rajasthan sailaaniyon ko heritage hotalon kaa anokhaa tajurba pesh karata he
 But these heritage hotels also need support for development, renovation and management
 isse gujarey jamaane ke kam se kam 2,000 se 2,500 kamare dobaaraa jinda ho uthenge
 While only 35 per cent of the rooms can be filled in the summer in the state, up to 80 per cent of the rooms are booked during the winter season and the rent also goes up by 40 to 50 per cent
 itihaas or puraani smritiyon ke haq main majboot gharelu marketing niti is khai ko badi had tak bhar sakati he
 Now that the next generation is commanding properties, many of them are exploring the possibility of converting their havelis and forts into hotels
 nai-nai jagahon ke prati sailaaniyon ke chaav kii khatir nae paryaton paripath bhi jode ja rahe hai

 Beijing's high officials like to call relations with Pakistan 'evergreen'
 magar haal ke hafton main achche mausam kii bhavishyavaanee tufaan ke aane main badal gai, jo aam taur par kam hi hota he
 The Chinese embassy in Islamabad issued a public warning on 8 December
 isamen kaha gaya ''aatankwaadi pakistan main chini sanghathanon or logon ko nishaanaa banaate hue silsilewar hamalon kaa mansuba bana rahe hai
 This warning also found a lot of space in the Chinese media
 shanghai ke visheshgyon ko kahana padaa ki ye hamale pakistan main chini nivesh ko khatre main daal sakate hai
 One aspect of this, according to two Asian diplomats in Beijing, is that China's unease over the security and other arrangements for projects under the $ 46 billion china-pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is increasing
 is galiyare main sadakon or bijli pariyojnaon kaa network khadaa kiya ja rahaa he, jo kashgar se arab sagar main guadar bandargah tak jaataa he or paak adhikrut kashmir se bhi gujarata he
 In May, two Chinese youth were kidnapped and killed in Quetta
 pakistan ne un par dakshin korian mishnariyon ke liye gaiyrkanoonee dharmopadesh kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 But there was no specific coverage in the Chinese media
 beijing ke liye badi chintaa kii baat ve matbhed hai jo sipiisi kii kai pariyojnaon ko lekar paidaa ho gaye hai
 Pakistan first upset Beijing a few days before a CPEC planning meeting, announcing that it withdrew the $ 14 billion dimmer-language hydroelectric project because of China's "strict" financial terms going against its interests is
 phir pakistan ke akhbaar don ne khabar chhaapi ki revolving fund banane ko lekar 'sarkaar ke saath matbhedon' kii vajah se ek chini company ne 2 arab dollar kii lahore-matiyaari transmishan line kaa kaam takreeban roak diya he
 The newspaper also claimed that in the November planning meeting, Beijing has told that it would stop putting money in three major road projects because of concerns over corruption
 haalanki videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa lu kong ne 11 disambar ko kaha, ''ham saraahna karte hai ki pakistan pariyojna or chini nagarikon kii suraksha donon ko ahmiyat de rahaa he
 "some of Beijing's scholars are of the opinion that CPEC will remain viable for a long time until it is integrated with other regional projects under the One Belt One Road (OBOR) project
" kuch afasaron kaa kahana he ki iske liye bharat ko bhi saath laane kii jarurat hogi, jo ilaake kaa sabase bada bazaar he, lekin obioar kii mukhaalafat kar rahaa he kyonki yah sabase ahm galiyare pioke main bharat kii samprabhutaa kaa ulanghan karata he
 Interestingly, Chinese Ambassador to India Luo Zhaohui revived his offer last month, which called for renaming CPEC, acknowledging India's concerns
 haalanki isaki tasdik chini mantralay ne nahin kii
 Indian officials believe that there is little possibility of China renaming CPEC or creating an alternative corridor for Jammu and Kashmir, given China's dedication to Pakistani sensitivities

 'saamana' main kaha gaya he ki pradhanmantri kaa aglaa lakshya ab paak adhikrut kashmir or baluchistan kii swatantraaa he
 We would not be surprised if the Prime Minister celebrated the next Diwali in Balochistan

 In the same way, you should visit Ram in Ayodhya and make a declaration that a Ram temple will be built and pay tribute to the martyred Ram servants

 gujarat kii disa, maninagar, tankaara, khambhaalia, mangrol, talaja, anand, maatar or linkheda (anusuchit janajati arakshit) siton par bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke vidhayakon ke istife ke baad up chunaav karaae ja rahe hai, jo loksabhaa chunaav main vijayi hokar sansad pahunch chuke hai
 In the presidential election, the opposition parties have made the election interesting by putting former Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar in the election arena
 mira kumaar kaa muqabla centre main sattarudh rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) ke ummidavaar or bihar ke purv rajyapal ramnath kovind se he
 Both candidates belong to the Dalit community and both belong to Bihar
 bataa den ki bihar mira kumaar kii janmasthali he, to kovind ke liye yah rajya unki karmasthali he
 In such a situation, if any candidate wins in this election, Bihar will win
 desh kii 17 vipakshi partiyon kii congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke netritv main hui baithak main rajg ke ramnath kovind se muqabla karne ke liye mira kumaar ko raashtrapati ummidavaar banane ke faisle tay hua
 After this it was decided that the main contest in this election is between two Dalit faces
 kovind jahaan bihar ke rajyapal rahe hai, vahiin mira is pradesh kii beti hai
 Although there may be many similarities between these two candidates in this election, there seems to be a split between the candidate's support in the ruling Grand Alliance in Bihar
 raashtrapati chunaav main janata dal (united) ke adhyaksh or bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne rajg ummidavaar ramnath kovind ko apana samarthan dene kii ghoshnaa kii he
 The Congress and RJD are in the grand alliance with Meira Kumar
 raajnneeti ke jaankaar surendra kishor kaa kahana hai ki lalu prasad kaa vipaksh ke saath jane ke alaava koi chaara hi nahin he
 He said that even though Lalu is pressuring Nitish to reconsider his decision, Nitish has been identified as the leader who did not change the decision
 unka kahana he ki agar sankhya bal par gaur kiya jaae to vah kovind ke saath he
 In such a situation, the opposition has fielded its candidate only to register his presence in this election
 unka daawa he ki is faisle se rajya main mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar ko koi pareshaani nahin hone vaali he
 He also said that, "for Nitish to be the Chief Minister, where the JDU is compelled to stay with the RJD
 vahiin lalu ko apane putron ko mantri pad par banaae rakhane ke liye nitish kumaar kaa saath dena unki majaburi he
 It is another matter that Nitish can go with the NDA, but there is no other way for Lalu to stay in the United Progressive Alliance (UPA)
 idhar, jadyu lalu ke punarvichaar karne kii apil ko nakaarte hue spasht kar chuke he, ki vah raashtrapati chunaav main kovind ke saath he
 Let me tell you that Kovind is from Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)
 aresas bijepi kaa maardarshak sanghathan he
 Its ideology and other secular parties, including the Congress, hold the nation responsible for the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi
 vaise, nitish ke faisle ke baad chunavi sameekaran badal gaye hai
 Bihar's role has also become important in this
 vaise lalu prasad, mira kumaar ko 'bihar kii beti' bataakar nitish par dabaav badha rahe hai
 Senior Patna journalist says that the main contest in this election is between Kovind and Meera
 unhone kaha, "lalu bhale hi mira ko 'bihar kii beti' bataakar nitish par dabaav bana rahe hai, lekin uttar pradesh ke 'laal' kovind ke liye bhi yah baat bahujan samaaj party or samaajawaadee party par lagu hogi
 He added, "this election is clearly a battle of two ideologies, with the figures favoring Kovind
 vaise is chunaav main jeet kisi kii bhi ho, lekin itnaa to tay he ki is chunaav main raashtrapati bhawan jane kaa rasta bihar se hi gujaregaa
