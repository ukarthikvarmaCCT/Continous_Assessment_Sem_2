 i will visit your schools and you will come to our schools
 iske baad bahes karte hai ki kya uphaas kaa vishay he or kya dekhakar ronaa aata he
 Sisodia made this statement in response to BJP President JP Nadda's statement in which he said that the Aam Aadmi Party has become a subject of ridicule
 sisodiya ke is twit ke jawaab main vijay goyal ne palatwaar karte hue kaha ki unhen chunauti sweekaar he
 Vijay Goel asked Sisodia to run Mustafabad School and asked for the date of the debate

 Vijay Goel said that why every third student of class x is failing in government schools? 76,523 children of class IX also failed the examination

 Sisodia ji, why do students who have passed from Delhi government schools not get admission in Delhi University? Please tell this how many children get admission
 5
 If your education reform claims are true, then why are millions of government school children failing in the exam every year? 6
 dilli sarkaar sarkari skulon main principal ke pad ko samaapt kyon nahin kar detii? 1028 sarkari skulon main se 800 skulon main vaise bhi koi principal nahin hai, isliye dilli sarkaar kii skulon kaa rigelt kharaab aa rahaa he
 BJP leader Vijay Goel said that once Sisodia visits Mustafabad School, he will also mention the names of 10 other government schools where basic facilities are not available for the students

 Shortly thereafter, reports of separation of writer Kanika Dhillon and her husband Prakash Kovelamudi also started coming out

 According to these reports, it was due to Kanika and Sahil's affair that Diya's reason for the marriage was broken
 kii shaadi bhi tut gai he
 Diya has rejected all the gossips about the marriage breakdown
 unhone ek twit kiya or likhaa, "ye un khabaron ko khaarij karne ke liye he jo media main mere or sahil ke algaav ko lekar chal rahi hai
 i am sad to see such irresponsible action
 "ek or twit main diya ne likhaa, "isse bhi zyada dukh kii baat ye he ki is sab main hamaari saathi kalakaar ke naam ko kharaab kiya ja rahaa he
 As a woman, i will not see another woman's name being tarnished with false accusations

 There is no third person in my and Sahil's separation
 hamane media ko dayaa dikhaane or is mushkil ghadi main hamen samay dene ko kaha tha
 i hope they respect this
 " diya ne kanika ke twit ke jawaab main unase maafee bhi maangi
 Earlier Kanika also said that this is a ridiculous, despicable and irresponsible act
 unhone twit main likhaa, "haasyaaspad, neech or gaiyr jimmedaarana! kaalpanik kahaniyaan likhnaa meraa kaam he! kya media thodaa jimmedaar nahin ho saktaa? agar do khabaren saath main ai hai to uskaa matlab ye nahin he ki wo donon judi hui hon

Pls get over it n let us get back 2work! - Kanika Dhillon (@kanikadhillon) August 2, 20191) This is to clarify and put to rest all kind of speculation that is being bandied about by a certain section of the media regarding my separation with Sahil
 It is most unfortunate to see the level of irresponsibility exercised
 - Dia Mirza (@deespeak) August 2, 20192) What is even more unfortunate is that our colleagues names are being tarnished and maligned by this media
 As a woman i will not stand for another woman’s name being used so irresponsibly to perpetuate a lie
 - Dia Mirza (@deespeak) August 2, 20193) There is absolutely no truth to the alleged reports and no third person is the reason for Sahil and i to part ways
 We have requested the media to be graceful and allow us this time for some privacy
 Really hope they can respect that

 " On Sunday, India made a clean sweep of the Australian team in the 4-match series
 is bich, vanade se sanyas le chuke sachin tendulkar form ke liye jujhate najar aae
 As the final Test match approached, speculation intensified as to whether Sachin would retire after this series? In Delhi, as soon as Dhoni hit a winning shot, Sachin Tendulkar shook both hands and thanked the people
 saaf taur par nahin kaha ja saktaa ki unka ishaara kis ore tha, par kayaas kuch aise hi lagaae ja rahe hai
 On Saturday too, a close friend of his family had said that Sachin Tendulkar may announce his retirement soon
 vahiin unke bhai ajit tendulkar ne bhi kotla main match dekhne ke liye tikat kharida tha
 All this boosted the discussion that Sachin could retire after this series
 yahi nahin, sachin tendulkar khud bhi kah chuke hai ki jab ve out of farm ho jaaenge to sanyas le lenge
 He had said, 'right now i am scoring and i am able to contribute to the team
 jab mujhe lagegaa ki main team ke liye baari pad rahaa hum to sanyas le luungaa
 Sachin had said that it would be selfish to retire while in form
 'vaise, sachin tendulkar sanyas kab lenge, yah faisla to sachin hi karenge
 It has been said about him that he will play as long as he wants and will retire whenever he wants

 sutron ke anusaar iske baad shiroj ke sadasyon or kaarykram ke aayojakon ko aage aakar kanhaiya kaa bachaav karnaa padaa or maahaul ko shant karwaanaa padaa
 In spite of the protest, Kanhaiya Kumar addressed the people present there

 After this action of India, former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Mehbooba Mufti has given a statement on the atmosphere of the country
 unhone kaha ki shikshit log bhi yuddh kii sambhaavna par khushi manaa rahe hai

 Mehbooba made several tweets on India's retaliation
 jammu kashmir kii purv mukhyamantri ne kaha ki bhartiya vaayu sena ke strike ke baad twitor or news channel par bade paimaane par yuddh unmaad hua
 The disturbing thing is that even educated people are cheering on the possibility of war
 jahaalat he ye sab
 He said that if my vengeance is unnecessary and if people question my nationalism, then so be it
 main shanti kaa paksh luungi or saikadon jaan jane ke mukaable main jidangiyon ko bachaane kaa paksh luungi
 He said that the Pulwama attack has undermined the environment of the country
 log khun ke liye taras rahe hai or badla lenaa chaahate hai
 But it should not be forgotten that violence gives rise to violence
 unhone kaha ki keval aashaa or prarthana kar sakate hai ki acchhee bhaavana jald hi prabal ho
 How much more damage will be done to Jammu and Kashmir? For how long will we bear the brunt purv siem ne kaha ki chunki pakistan ne daawa kiya he ki bhartiya vayusena dwaara elosi kaa ulanghan karne ke baavjood kisi ke hataahat hone kii soochna nahin he, unhen aage badhane ke liye ek saamanjasypurna rukh apnaanaa chahie
 Or, an already volatile situation will spiral out of control and Kashmiris will be the largest casualties as always
 Todays IAF strikes were followed by mass war hysteria on twitter & news channels
 Most of these people are ignorant who have suspended the use of common sense
 But its disconcerting that educated privileged people are cheering on at the prospect of a war
 This is true jahaalat

 FDI should come
 hamaari aapatti sirf is baat ko lekar he ki kisaanon ke muddon ko hal kiya jaae

 bollywood main uthaa # metoo kaa tufaan abhi puri tarah se thama nahin he
 The debate between the two has continued on social media ever since Yoga Guruira Trivedi had roped in famous writer Chetan Bhagat
 taaja ghatnakram main ira trivedi ne chetan bhagat ke saath email par hui puri baatcheet ko hi saarvajanik kar diya he
 Let me tell you that a few days ago, Chetan Bhagat issued an email of Ira saying that Trivedi had messaged him like 'miss you, Kiss you'
 jiske baad ab ira ne aage ke email ko saarvajanik kiya he
 > Ira's email to Chetan
 
 
 jis email kaa screenshot chetan bhagat ne saajha kiya tha, usamen ira ne apane massej ke aakhir main Miss You, Kiss You likhaa tha
 > Chetan's answer to Ira
 
 
 iskaa riplai karte hue chetan ne kuch baaten kii
 And later in response to Miss You said thanks and in response to Kiss You wrote, is this just Figure of speech (alankar) or is there something changing here?> Ira's reply to Chetan
 
 
 iske baad ke jawaab main ira ne donon ke bich chal rahi yoga guru ko lekar baatcheet par hi baaten kii
 > Chetan's answer to Ira
 
 
 haalanki, isse agle email main chetan ne yoga guru kii baat ko aage badhaayaa
 But in the end he asked what happened to his k (K) question? What is the whole issue? Actually, this whole issue came after the # metoo campaign started
 jab ira trivedi ne chetan bhagat par aarope lagaaya tha ki unhone unhen apane kamare main bulaakar kis karne kii koshish kii thi
 Chetan then shared a screenshot of Ira's email on Twitter
 or ulta ira par hi aarope laga die the
 Since then, this dispute was going on between the two

 kitaab : a happy place and adar storijlekhak: vineeta mokkilakimat: 275 ru
 Publisher: Harper Collins Publishers indiavinita Mokkil has told stories
 16 kahaniyaan
 Everything is small in the body, but openness in the face
 kisi kahani main metro city main darkate-panpate rishte najar aate hai to koi kahani hamen chhattisgarh main maovadiyon se jujhate parivaar ke bich le ja patakati he
 The way of telling these stories is simple
 bhashaa aisi ki uske jaal main ulajhaa na jaae
 And finally, one end of every story connects with the Maharajadhani of this continent from delhi-ncr
 is kitaab ko mahanagar ke aakhyaan ke rup main padhaa janaa chahie
 However, after a while, the stories end up being repetitive
 kai jagah kahani jarurat se zyada bhavuk karne kii koshish karti he
 Disunity and sorrow also create panic everywhere
 kisi bhi lekhak ke liye yah ek badi uplabdhi hoti he ki vah jis vishay ke bare main apane pathakon ko bataanaa chahta he, usamen safal ho
 It is clear that Mokkil has been fully successful in this and it is not just the language or sentiment but also because of the way the story is told
 unhone sirf kalpanaaon kaa sahaara nahin liya
 Tales the reality in such a way that it started making us see our own, known and heard story
 ab jab is tarah kaa judaav bane to kahani ke aakhri sire tak saath safar lajimi ho jaataa he
 Another feature of a Happy Place and Other Stories is the achievement of poetry in the place
 iske alaava har kahani main suspence banane kii bhi koshish kii gai he
 There is a story called 'A Quiet Day', about a suicidal woman
 apane pati or bachche kii maut kaa badla lene ke liye vah har jagah morcha kholti rahati he
 At the end of the story there is a haze of suspicion, amid which the holy intrigues of the woman continue
 ek or kahani he
 The title is 'A Case of Fire'
 iskaa nayak he gyaan, jo dilli uniwarsity main professor he 
 Knowledge often lags in the essential ceremonies of the home
 lekin aaj gyaan kii beti kaa berthde he
 He has to reach on time
 magar is baar uske raste main barish khadi he
 He feels that a gift will have to be taken as a penalty to lie down
 gyaan mal main pahunchataa he or peeche se mal lock ho jaataa he
 Now there is knowledge and in her hand is the gift of a daughter
 to party main time par pahunchane ke chakkar main vah barish kii vajah se or let ho jaataa he
 To convince the daughter, she goes to buy a gift from the mall where the tragedy occurs and Gyan gets locked in the mall
 is kahani ko itane dilachasp tareeke se pesh kiya he ki reader ke man main utsukata bani rahati he ki gyaan us raat ghar pahunchaa yaa nahin
 Similarly, in the 'baby Baby' story, a 50-year-old man aspires to become a father
 vah apni duusari bivi se is umr main baccha chahta he
 'the Tennant' story is about a woman and her daughter
 beti naukari or vidhwaa maa ke bich main naukari ko chunati he
 The mother keeps a girl for her care, the same name as her daughter
 jis kahani se kitaab kaa tital niklaa, usamen bhi imoshan kaa hi khel he
 'A Happy Place' is about Asha, who was happily living with her small family in Chhattisgarh
 ek din uskaa puraa parivaar maovadiyon ne chin liya
 Asha came to Delhi and worked as a Med in a rich family
 yah jagah har lihaaj se ek happy place thi
 Was work
 pagaar thi or dil bahalane ke liye madam kaa peter naam kaa ek chota baccha bhi
 But one day Asha got angry with Happy Place
 kitaab kii kahaniyon main imotional ditels par bahut jor he
 Start reading with this in mind
 malakhan ne bataaya, " main bhagwaan shiv kaa bhakt hum, isliye main 'vighnaharta ganesh' main yah role nibhaane kaa mauka paakar bahut zyada khush hum
 My mother calls me Shiva and now the whole country knows me as Lord Shiva
 yah bahut badi jimmedaari he or mujhe bharosa he ki main apane role ke saath puraa insaaf karuunga
 " bavana vidhansabha main 23 agast ko hone ja rahe upachunaav ko jeetne ke liye tamaam raajnneetik dal har koshish kar rahe hai
 Bawana by-election is very important for the Aam Aadmi Party
 yahi vajah he ki prachaar khatm hone ke kuch ghante pehle arvind kejariwal ne bavana kii galiyon main ghar-ghar jaakar vot maange
 Aam Aadmi Party focused more on the Nedor to Door campaign rather than meeting people and seeking votes
 kabhi selfi, to kabhi phool maala ke swaagat ke saath arvind kejariwal janata se vot kii guhaar lagaate najar aae
 During the padyatra, Arvind Kejriwal would intermittently meet the public and also promised to solve their problems
 vot kii apil karte hue kejariwal ne bijepi ke maujuuda ummidavaar or purv main 'aap' ke vidhayak rahe, veda prakaash ko dhokheybaaj bhi bataaya
 Kejriwal also took responsibility for the problems, during his padyatra in Shahid Dairy area, Aervind Kejriwal also talked to the people
 unhone kaha, 'pichley ek ghante se aapke ilaake main gum rahaa hum
 There are three major problems of water, street and school
 pani or gali kii main guarantee letaa hoon
 The contract for Shahbad Dairy has been given, the streets have started to be built
 pani kii pipeline kai jagah dal chuki hai
 School will be ready in 6 months
 'jamkar vot dene kii apilkejariwal ne aage kaha, 'pichhali baar aapane jamkar vot diya tha
 It was a mistake that he gave the ticket to the wrong man
 isane hamen or aapako bhi dhokhaa diya
 You are requested to vote strongly this time too
 aapaki samasyaon kii jimmedaari lekar ja rahaa hum
 'AAP will only make Kamkejriwal appeals to the public in every rally, every public meeting during campaigning in Bawana, that it is useless to vote for the BJP and the Congress because Aam Aadmi Party government is in Delhi and Aam Aadmi Party will do it

 ye maamla usee daur kaa he, jab nirmal baba nirmalajit singh narula ke naam se singhbhum zile ke bahragoda main mining kii thekedaari kiya karte the
 Jharkhand State Minerals Development Corporation has now remembered that the firm named Narula Minerals in Bahragoda used to mine kyanite stone
 is form ne korporation se 65 hazaar rupee kaa pathar kharida, lekin keemat chukaaye bina hi saal 2000 main chanpat ho gai
 JSMDC also sent a notice for recovery at Narula Minerals' address in Argowda area of ranchi, but the address was incorrect, so all the letters were returned
 jharkhand ke khanij nigam kaa kahana he ki agar narula minerals naam kii us form kaa nirmal baba se rishta sabit hua, to bakaayaa vasuulne ke liye kanoonee kaarywahi bhi kii jaaegi
 That means then Nirmal Baba's problems may increase further

 beete saal hi hoicourt ko murti visarjan ke maamle main dakhal dena pad gaya tha
 Mamta Banerjee had prohibited idol immersion on the day of Moharram
 lekin hoicourt ne is faisle par roak laga di thi
 At that time the BJP accused the Mamata government of appeasement

 The Rajya Sabha proceedings were interrupted several times due to heavy uproar by the opposition parties on this issue and eventually adjourned for the whole day

 While many young faces of 26 to 35 years were in the fray in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, but only 23 could be won
 is baar 28 or 29 saal kii umr main bhi do yuva saansad banane main safal rahe hai
 Chandrani Murmu became the youngest MP to win elections from Keonjhar Lok Sabha seat in Odisha at the age of 25 and 11 months
 odisha main bijd ne kyonjhar loksabhaa seat se chandrani murmu ko ummidavaar banaaya tha
 Chandrani achieved the title of becoming the youngest MP by defeating a BJP candidate
 vahiin bijepi ne kendriya mantri anant kumaar ke nidhan ke baad bengalooru dakshin se unki patni kii jagah yuva chehre 28 varshiya tejasvi par daanv khelaa tha
 Tejashwi won on the basis of Modi wave and his popularity
 unhone congress ke varisht netaa bike prasad ko teen lakh 31 hajaar se adhik voton se haraaya
 Another young candidate has won the election from Karnataka itself
 ye janata dal secular mukhiya echdi devegoda ke pautra bataae jate hai
 The name is Prajwal Revanna
 unhone karnataka ke hasan sansadeey seat se ek lakh 41 hajaar 324 voton se jeet hasil kii he
 This is the only seat on which the Janata Dal Secular won
 prajval revanna kii umr 29 saal he
 They did not get success in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, many young candidates had landed, but they did not get success
 misaal ke taur par dekhen to aam aadmi party ke tikat par dakshin dilli seat se raghav chaddha utre the, magar unhen bijepi ke ramesh bidhudi ne saadhe teen lakh se adhik voton se haraaya
 Similarly, the 26-year-old grand Vishnoi was fielded by the Congress from Hisar
 magar unhen chaar lakh se zyada voton se bijepi ke bijendra singh ne haraa diya
 The CPI-M had fielded 26-year-old Biraj Deka from the Kakarjhor seat
 magar vah nirdaleey enke saraania ke haathon haar gaye
 The figures of young mps were elected in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections by 32 mps below the age of 35, but this time the number has come down to 23
 yah haal tab he , jab desh kii ausat umr 27
 9 is age, but statistics show that 2 in each Lok Sabha election
 2 pratishat saansad hi 30 se kam umr ke ban pate hai
 The special thing is that since independence, the number of elderly mps in Parliament is increasing in every Lok Sabha election held till now
 us anupaat main yuva saasand jitkar nahin aa rahe
 Another major reason behind this is that the parties show little interest in putting the youth under 30 years in the fray
 pakistan main 25 july ko aam chunaav hone ja rahe he, jisamen bharat samet duniya bhar kii nigahen tiki hui hai
 This is perhaps the first time in the 71-year history of Pakistan, when the biggest terrorists of the world are openly doing politics
 aatanki sanghathan lashkar-e-taiyaba or jamaat-ud-daawa kaa sargana hafiz said or uske bade-bade aatanki gurgey chunavi maidan main hai
 Hafiz Saeed himself is dreaming of conquering Islamabad by riding on an independent party and its 250 terror hire party
 mumbai hamale ke mastermind hafiz said samet kai khoonkhaar aatanki pakistan kii sansad main pahunchane ko baichaiyn hai
 Not only this, terrorist organizations are also bargaining with political parties to take advantage of their domination
 aatanki sanghathan taharik-e-labbac pakistan ne chunaav main 152 aatankiyon ko maidan main utaara he
 His inclination also remains towards Hafiz Saeed
 kya pakistan kaa cheharaa banegaa khoonkhaar aatanki hafiz said?pakistanke chunaav maidan main khoonkhaar aatankiyon ke utarane se sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya ab hafiz said jaise aatanki mulk-e-pakistan kaa cheharaa banenge? jin aatankiyon ko enie se lekar siie tak duniya kii kai agenciyaan dhund rahi hai, kya wo pakistan kii hukumat chalaayenge? ek lamhe ke liye soch ke dekhie ki khuda na khaasta agar duniya kaa yah most wonted aatanki pakistan kaa vazeer ban gaya, to padosi mulk pakistan kii tasviir kya hogi? kya masood azhar, said salauddin or jackieur rahamaan lakhvi jaise aatanki iske salaahkaar honge?hafiz kaa betaa or damaad bhi chunaav maidan menhafiz said kaa betaa hafiz talha said or damaad hafiz khalid valid bhi chunaav maidan main hai
 Both are contesting on the ticket of Allaho Akbar Party
 hafiz talha said sargoda se chunaav lard rahaa he, to hafiz kalid valid lahore se chunaav lard rahaa he
 Like Hafiz Saeed, his son and son-in-law also have dozens of terror cases registered
 iske alaava jamaat-ud-daawa kaa aatanki kaari mohammad shaikh yaqub bhi allaaho akbar party ke tikat par chunaav lard rahaa he
 It is included in America's Terror List
 ahale sunnat val jamaat kaa aatanki ramajaan mengal or aatanki aurangzeb faruki bhi chunaav maidan main hai
 They are accused of being involved in terrorist activities and carrying out several bomb blasts
 mulk kii sabase badi vipakshi party ko aatankiyon kaa khulaa samarthanpakistan main aatanki sabase badi vipakshi raajnneetik party 'pakistan taharik-e-insaaf party' ke samarthan main khulkar utar aae hai
 Imran Khan's Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf Party has endorsed the leader of the terrorist organization harkat-ul-mujahideen and Fazlur Rahman Khalil for al-qaeda
 global aatankiyon kii america list main shaamil kukhyat aatanki fajalur rahamaan khalil kaa imran ko samarthan dena is baat kii taraf ishaara kar rahaa he ki sarhad paar satta hasil karne kaa jo khel khelaa ja rahaa he, wo na sirf khud pakistan ke liye ghaatak sabit ho saktaa he, balki bharat ke liye bhi mushkil paidaa kar sakati he
 This nexus between the Pakistani army and Imran is also a sign that Imran's path has already been cleared by sending former PM Nawaz Sharif to jail, and the right amount is being done by sending notice to his party's candidates
 saansad bheje ja rahe jail or aatanki bheje ja rahe sansadpakistan ke kai saansadon ne pratibandhit aatanki sanghathanon se jude ummidavaaron ko chunaav ladane kii manjuuri die jane ko lekar chintaa jataa rahe hai
 Pakistan Muslim league-nawaz (PML-N) Senate member Parvez Rashid said referring to the sending of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to jail, that mps are being sent to jail and terrorists are being brought to Parliament
 unhone pakistan chunaav ayog ko aagaah karte hue kaha ki agar aatankiyon ke chunaav ladane par bain nahin lagaaya gaya, to ye sansad main aa jaaenge
 Also Sheri Rehman, Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and a key member of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), warned that allowing candidates associated with terrorist organizations to contest the elections would bring them into the mainstream
 unhone kaha ki agar ye aatanki sansad main aa gaye, to ham saans nahin le paaenge
 Terrorism is the biggest threat to Pakistan
 Pakistan's opposition party PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto also believes that terrorism is a major threat to Pakistan
 unka kahana he ki pakistan kii vartmaan sthiti or bhavishya ke liye sabase bada khatra aatankwaad he
 This danger has to be eradicated from society
 haal hi main pakistan main raajnneetik reliyon main bade aatankwaadi hamale bhi dekhne ko mili hai
 More than 150 people, including two leaders, have died in these attacks
 aatankiyon ke chunaav ladane se US or bharat bhi chintitpakistan main aatankiyon ke chunaav ladane ko lekar bharat or america bhi behad chintit hai
 The US has expressed concern over the lashkar-e-taiba terrorists entering the election
 america ne apni chintaaon se pakistan ko avgat bhi kara diya he
 At the same time, the European Union has also asked Pakistan to create safe and fear-free conditions for the general election

 police ne shav ko kabje main lekar jaanch shuru kar di

 yahaan usne bataaya ki ravindra kii sadak haadase main maut ho gai he

 premi se tha teen maah kaa baccha
 
 
 During interrogation, the woman said that she had a three-month-old baby from her lover
 jab is baat kii khabar ravindra ko lagi to vah iskaa virodh karne laga
 There was a dispute between them on the next day
 aaj ramdev or anna hajaare pune main saajha press conference karne vaale hai

 Many places which have more land and wealth are considered great

 centre sarkaar ne notebandi ke jariye 500 or 1000 rupee ke puraane noton ko band kar 500 or 2000 rupee ke nae note chhapane kaa faisla bhrashtachar par lagaam lagane ke liye liya tha, lekin ab note chhapane vaali press ke andar hi ek adhikari dwaara bhrashtachar kaa haroonges maamla saamne aayaa he
 The incident is of Dewas Bank Note Press in Madhya Pradesh
 devas bank note press main dipti controlar manohar verma ko shuukravaar ko 200 rupee ke nae noton kii do gaddiyaan churaakar le jate giraftaar kar liya gaya, jiske baad beete 8 maheene se chal rahi is ajeebogareeb chori kaa khulaasa hua
 After arresting this officer of Dewas Bank Note, when the CISF seized new notes of 26 lakh 9 thousand 300 rupees from his dustbin and locker in the office
 afasar ke ghar kii bhi talaashi lee gai
 Surprisingly, Manohar Verma used to steal only the rejected note
 manohar verma ke ghar par chhapemari ke dauraan divaan ke andar juute ke dibbon or kapade kii theliyon main chhipaakar rakhe gaye 64
 New notes of Rs 5 lakh were found
 jaanchakarta adhikariyon ke mutabik, yah afasar sirf 200 or 500 rupee kerijected noton kii gaddiyanhi churaataa tha
 The most interesting thing is that the officer used to steal the rejected notes
 darasal manohar verma suparvizer str kaa adhikari tha or us shrenee main padasth tha jahaan trutipurna noton kii chantai kaa kaam hota he
 Manohar Verma is the head of the note verification section
 chunki manohar verma ucch padasth adhikari tha, isliye na to uske loker kii jaanch hoti thi or na hi offis main aate-jate uski talaashi lee jaati thi
 Taking advantage of this, Manohar Verma used to steal notes by hiding in clothes and shoes
 siaisef ne manohar verma ko police ko saunp diya he or police ne note churaane ke aarope main unhen giraftaar kar liya he
 During questioning, Manohar Verma has confessed to stealing the note
 usne yah bhi bataaya ki vah sardiyon main jacket main chhipaakar bhi note le jaataa tha
 a day earlier, a CISF jawan suspected Manohar Verma of throwing something in the dustbin
 darasal manohar verma ne dustbin ke paas lakdi kaa ek box rakh rakhaa or vah security gards kii nigaah bachaakar noton kii gaddi usee box main phenk detaa tha
 Later, he would hide his bag of notes in clothes and shoes and leave the office safely without checking
 siaisef ke jawan ko jab manohar verma par baar-bardstbin main kuch phenkeneco lekar shaq hua to usne apane ucch adhikari ko suchit kiya
 Officials fixed the movable CCTV camera installed there to dustbin Manohar Verma
 bas agle hi din yani shuukravaar ko manohar verma lakdi ke bakse main noten kii gaddi phenkate hue rangehathon pakad liye gaye
 a post shared by Aamrapali (@ aamrapali1101) on Sep 24, 2018 at 8:45 pm PDT aap ise anuwaad kaa locha kah sakate hai
 The reason for this is also not known
 lekin fasebuk par maujuud transleshan tul main agar aap 'maad**da' shabd likhenge to ise translet kar 'muslim' likhata he
 The word 'mad ** the' is used in India as a vulgar abusive language
 lekin fasebuk jaise bade soshal media plateform par is tarah kii gadabadi kyon ho rahi he or fasebuk kii team abhi is gadabadi ko pakad kyon nahin pai, yah hairaani karne vaali baat he
 Facebook is a service that is used by approximately one and a half billion people worldwide
 is shabd ko lekar gadabadi sabase pehle india today group kii website'dailyo'ne notice kiya
 This website is a forum for ideas
 fasebukatranslet jaise tuls kaa istemaal seekhney or data kii jaanch ke liye kiya jaataa he ki wo puri tarah thik hai
 However, humans also have a hand in it
 fasebuk ne 2011 main transleshan kaa feechar launch kiya tha lekin usne yah nahin bataaya ki aakhir wo kis tarah kaam karata he or galati hone par ise kis tarah thik kiya jaataa he
 In 2012, it was said by Facebook that it takes help of volunteers from all over the world for the translation tool
 us vakt media main ai ek report main kaha gaya tha ki ek lakh se zyada yugers ne fasebuk transleshan aplication install kiya he or 10 hajaar se adhik logon ne angreji ke content ko tamaam europea bhashaaon main anuwaad karne main fasebuk kii madad kii
 It is possible that Facebook is still using the same process to translate the content on its website
 or shaayad isi vajah se 'maad**da' ko india main translet kar 'muslim' dikhaa rahaa ho
 It is indeed a matter of surprise if Facebook takes the help of volunteers like this for serious work like Facebook translation
 kyonki fasebuk content ko lekar behad gambhir he
 If a user posts sensitive content, Facebook usually blocks or deletes the post
 fasebuk ne aise content ke liye tamaam staron par filter laga rakhe hai
 It is surprising how Facebook can allow such a translation where 'maad ** d' is compared to a Muslim
 hamane fasebuk se is masale par baat kii or jab unka jawaab aayega to use apadet bhi karenge
 Interestingly, this is not the first time such an issue has surfaced on social media
 isse pehle google map par "anti-national" search karne par jeenyu or hyderabad yunicercity jaise vishvavidhyalay dikhaai die hai
 Sources in Google told that this happened because the use of such words in the website world and media was associated with these universities

 How long will a woman continue to fight for independence in independent India? The same concern about the emancipation of women is the main concern of Maitrei's new novel gunah-begunah, written in the reportage style

 For example, a social survey has been prepared by threading various individuals and events into a narrative

 But even after reading the novel, the question remains in the mind whether the writer has accepted the Indian police system as a male-society or it is used only as a symbol? However, Maitreyi's plot is simultaneously confronted with questions related to the main concern of a particular section of Indian town society

 Despite this, there is also no denying that while the style of the author to speak out on the pretext of police brutality limits the novel's face, on the other hand, the lack of empirical realism gives the readers a complete 'nod to the plot'

 world cap main 2015 main padaarpan ke baad se antarrashtriya cricket main badi chalaang lagane vaali team afghanistan world cap main agar ek-do badi tiimon ko pachhaadne main safal rahaa, to kisi ko aashcharya nahin hoga
 In the World Cup, all teams have to face each other and in such a situation, no team would like to take it lightly
 2015 main afghanistan sirf ek match main jeet darj kar sakaa tha, lekin us samay raashid khan jaise match vijeta team main nahin the

 centre sarkaar ne opi singh ko 18 din guzar jane ke baad bhi abhi tak relive nahin kiya he
 The high-level committee of the Yogi government selected OP Singh, currently posted as DG of CISF, as the new police chief of the state and his name was also announced, but even after 18 days, the central government has so far He has not been relieved of his post
 centre ne singh ko uttar pradesh cader main bhejne kii koi anushansa bhi nahin kii he
 The post of UP DGP is still vacant, in which Yogi Adityanath can announce the new name of DGP of Uttar Pradesh
 ediji lau and order sambhaal rahe dijipi kaa kamyupi dijipi kaa pad pichley 15 dinon se khaali he or philhal ediji lau and order anand kumaar dijipi kaa padbhaar sambhaal rahe hai
 Most surprisingly, both the Center and the state are ruled by the BJP, despite the decision to send an IPS officer back
 mulaayam ke kareebi opi sinhasatta ke galiyaaron main is baat kii charchaa aam he ki opi singh mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ko pasand nahin kyonki opi singh kii mulaayam singh yadav se nikatataa jagajaahir he
 Also, the BSP may oppose him, as he was also the SSP of Lucknow during the guest house scandal with Mayawati
 kis aadhaar par nayaa dijipi chunenge siem yogi?sabase bada sawaal yah he ki agar opi kii jagah siem yogi adityanath kisi nae dijipi ko chunate hai to uskaa aadhaar kya hoga? kya varishthata ke aadhaar par doosraa naam saamne aayega? yaa phiryogi adityanaipane pasand kaa dijipi laaenge
 According to close sources, Yogi Adityanath wants to give time to the new DGP so that he can get the desired results from him
 saath hi dijipi aisa ho jiske netritv main 2019 kaa chunaav bhi nikaala ja sake
 In such a situation, there are only one name, which can be of the liking of the yogi
 sab kuch chhod desh chunaav main laga rahaa
 Food also diverted attention from the provision of water
 is bich pataa chal rahaa he ki desh main pani ko lekar immergency jaise halaat banate ja rahe hai
 Officially, only the horrific situation of Maharashtra and Gujarat is known
 vaise to prachaaratmak media se aisi khabaren gaayab hi hai lekin janata ke sarokaar rakhane vaala media desh ke baaki hisson main bhi pani ke liye haahaakaar machane kaa andeshaa bataa rahaa he
 It is now known that the condition of poor areas has stopped, otherwise the reality is that in Bundelkhand the situation has been getting worse from last one fortnight
 bhale hi chaar paanch saal se desh main ye halaat nae na hon, lekin abhi iskaa akalan nahin hua he ki tivrata ke lihaaj se is baar sankat kitna zyada gaharaa rahaa he
 Of course, there are four weeks left in the rains this year
 itani jaldi jal pariyojnaayen nahin ban saktin
 No emergency plan can be made
 yani tay he ki is saal barish ke chaar maheenon baad bhi pani kii kami kaa jo sankat aane kaa andeshaa he usase bachane kaa philhal koi intjaam nahin ho saktaa
 That means it is certain that next year we will be crying again on the same day
 bilkul usee tarah jis tarah se pichley kuch saal se lagaataar rote rahe
 The bottom line of the whole thing is that the issue of water management is much bigger than the matter of economic development
 itnaa bada ki kisi afedfe main aarthik vikaas ke aankade dhare rah jaaenge
 No country gets water from other countries
 isiilie hamen kudarat se jitna pani muhaiyaa hota he use hi zyada se zyada bharkar rakhane kaa intjaam karne ke alaava koi chaara nahin he
 And after ten years, when that much water will start falling, then once the water is used, it should be cleaned again and the methods of re-using it should be kept in mind from now
 sanad rahe, pani kaa masalaa raashtra par kisi bhi khatre se zyada bada he

 This time on August 15, when Narendra Modi arrived at the Red Fort to hoist the tricolor, political analysts raised high expectations with his speech

 But what is this
 
 
 ? modi to khule main shouch band karne or saaf-safai par jor dete nazar aae
 It is not a matter of debate that open defecation and cleanliness is not a minor issue
 yah utana hi gambhir or mahatvapurn vishay he, jitna desh main videshi nivesh ko badhaava dena yaa lakhon berozegaron ko naukari dena yaa mahangaai kam kar logon ko raahat dena
 But the question is why the Prime Minister felt the need to speak about it
 
 
 ? kya yah baat neeche se shuru nahin honi chahie thi
 
 
 The hamaari shashan pranali britain kii westminster paddati par aadhaarit he
 The Prime Minister is the head of the Cabinet
 yani vah 'baraabar waalon main pehla' yaa 'first amang ikvals' he
 It is true that with the passage of time, the strength of the Prime Minister has increased, and this depends on the individual as well
 bharat ke sandarbh main yah baat isliye bhi mahatvapurn he, kyonki yahaan sabhi tarah ke pradhanmantri hue hai
 Many who used their power to the fullest and some who were accused of reducing the dignity of the post
 magar sawaal yah he ki jis tarah modi aam logon se judi choti-choti baton kii parvaah kar unhen rashtriya pariprekshya main uthaa rahe hai, aisa karne main unke mantrimandal ke kuch saathi kyon peeche rah jate hai
 Modi did a similar thing about attaching documents
 lakhon log har rose photocopiyon or halafnaamon ko satyapit karaane ke liye rajpatrit adhikariyon kii khoj main bhatakate hai, lekin ab aisa karnaa jaruri nahin rahaa
 How many of you, who have ever found a porter at the railway station, who can deliver your goods to the car according to the rates fixed by the Ministry of Railways
 
 
 ? aap kisi bujurg ko gaadi tak pahunchaana chaah rahe hon or wheel chair mil jaae or kuli uchit dar par pahunchaa sake
 
 
 The Is it possible for this to happen in India without the help of a porter and without climbing the stairs go straight to the car
 
 
 ? aapaki yatra kaa achaanak kaarykram bane or aap chaahe kuch adhik paise hi dekar sahi, conform berth lekar train kii yatra kar saken
 
 
 The rail bhawan main baithkar bullate train kii yojana banane vaale railmantri kya in vishyon par dhyaan nahin de sakate
 
 
 The Can he not strictly do the work which is his responsibility to his officers? aisa kyon hota he ki tyohaar ke maukey par steshnon par bhagdad jaise halaat banate hai or rail mantralay pehle se adhik gadiyon kii vyavastha nahin kar saktaa
 a good system has been introduced for tolls on the highway
 i-toll se logon kii dikkaton kaa hal hoga
 But this is still the initial system
 enechaeai 22, 28, 32 rupee jaisi toll daren kyon rakhata he, 20, 30, 35 rupee aadi kyon nahin? chuttay paison ko lekar vivaad, unke badale chips yaa toffee pakadaana or samay kii barbaadi kya ek chota-sa kadam uthaakar nahin roki ja sakati
 
 
 The hamamen se kitne log internet istemaal karne ke liye beasenal kii sevaayen lene kaa jokhim uthaa sakate hai
 
 
 The It is not that people are satisfied with the services of private companies, but apart from this, what is the option left
 modi jis digital india kii baat kar rahe hai, use beasenel gaanv-gaanv tak kaise pahunchayegaa
 
 
 The logon ke jivan main badi baton ke bajaae choti-choti baton kaa adhik asar hota he
 People complain about the difficulties surrounding them rather than on big issues
 inhen se sarkaar or netaaon ke bare main unki raay banati he
 This opinion is reflected through evms during elections
 aisa nahin he ki netaa yah baat jaanate nahin, magar jaanate hue bhi anjaan banakar ve kisi or kaa nahin, apana hi nuksaan kar rahe hote hai

 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is the target during this visit
 unka naaraa he 'nitish hataao or bihar bachaao
 "paswan says," If Nitish Kumar ruled Bihar for the next three years, children would have liquor bottles in their hands instead of slates, copies and books as the government was opening liquor shops in villages

 With Paswan counting the flaws, the LJP alliance formed a government, all with Indira Awas, permanent teachers on contract and Rs 25,000 for the birth of a daughter
 jamaa karaane kaa vaada bhi kar rahe hai
 Lok Sabha elections are to be held in 2014 and Bihar assembly elections in 2015
 saal bhar main paswan kii yah duusari yatra he
 In 2012, he highlighted the flaws of the Bihar government through the Sankalp Yatra
 paswan akele shaks nahin hai jo thand ke is mausam main rajnatik garmaahat paidaa kar rahe hai
 Lalu Prasad Yadav, the supremo of RJD, the leading opposition party in Bihar, is also on Parivartan Yatra
 satta main vaapasi kii aas lagaae lalu prasad janata ko apane paksh main golband karne kii koshish main jute hai
 In the course of the Purnia visit, Lalu said in appeal to the people, "admittedly, there were some mistakes during my reign, but forgive him and give him another chance
" aisi galati doharaai nahin jaaegi
 Nitish is also on Lalu's target
 ve kehete hai, ''meri yatra kaa makasad sushasan kii ding haankane vaale nitish kumaar ke kushasan par chot karnaa he
 "to gain the trust of minorities that have a strong support base of RJD, Lalu says," Lalu would like to rot but never join hands with communal forces
 maine hi adwani ke rath ko roak kar jail bhejne kaa kaam kiya tha
 "not only LJP and RJD, Congress state president Chaudhary Mehboob Ali Kaiser also went on a Pol Khol Yatra last year against the state government for disturbances in development schemes and financial irregularities
 ab tak yatra puri nahi hui he
 Upendra Kushwaha, who has formed a Navnirman Morcha, who has resigned from the JD (U) and resigned from the Rajya Sabha membership since January 17 on the issue of corruption and misrule, has also left for the districts
 pichley saal 9 november ko sipii-emel ke rashtriya mahasachiv dipankar bhattacharya ne parivartan raily kaa aayojan kiya
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is at the forefront of the yatras compared to the visits of his opponents
 pichley saat saal ke antaraal main unhone panch yatraaen puri kii, jabaki november 2011 se seva yatra par hai, jiskaa pehla charan janvari 2013 main 11 jilon ke dauron se puraa hoga
 They believe that their service journey is proving useful and effective

 However, during the Adhikar Yatra, there is a large crowd at Nitish's meetings
 nitish kehete hai, ''jedy (you) kii is muhim kaa makasad bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dilaane ke liye jan samarthan jutanaa he
 However, the chest of some people keeps on seeing good governance and development
 ” magar adhikaar raily main virodh pradarshan kii ghatnaon ne nitish ko bhi sochane par majaboor kar diya he
 At the same time, BJP has announced to hold Hunkar rally in April

 The past of the yatras is drawing the leaders towards themselves
 pehali dfa farvari-march 2005 main nitish ne tatkaaleen rajyapal bootaa singh ke vidhansabha bhang karne or raashtrapati shashan kii anushansa karne ke faisle ke khilaaf nyaay yatra yojit kii thi
 The NDA victory in November 2005 gave Nitish the credo
 unhone 2009 loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle vikaas yatra or 40 main se 32 siton par jeet ke baad dhanyavad yatra kii
 Interacted with villagers through migration tour from December 2009
 2010 vidhansabha chunaav ke pehle vishwaas yatra kii jabaki 243 main se 206 siton par endie kii jeet ke baad ve seva yatra par hai
 Not only this, they have also sent Aman Rath, Nirbhay Rath, Jananayak Karpoori Rath, Kisan Rath, Swavalamban Rath
 vaise to reliyon ko lekar lalu charchit rahe hai, jinhone 15 saal ke shasankaal main 13 mahareliyaan kii hai
 But the journey started by Nitish, who has now become exemplary even for the opponents
 pehali baar 1990 main jab lalu mukhyamantri bane the tab unhone garib maharaila kaa aayojan kiya tha
 In 1997, while traveling to Ranchi for dedication in fodder scam, Garib Chetna Rath traveled
 unhone 2004 loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle 30 april, 2003 ko lathi main tel pilaavan raily yojit kii
 RJD had won 24 seats in this election
 aisa nahin he ki reliyaan or yatraaen netaaon kii har mushkilen aasaan karti rahi hai
 Lalu organized the Sankalp Yatra through Garib Chetna Rath in September 2005 and the Warning Rally in October 2007, but his problems did not ease
 farvari 2005 ke chunaav ke pehle paswan kii raily main logon kaa apaar samarthan mila, lekin sarkaar banane ke mudde par kharaab pradarshan ke kaaran aath maah baad ke chunaav main ve haashie par aa gaye jabaki unhone bhaichara yatra nikaali thi
 Social activist Anna Hazare has decided to start agitation from Patna's Gandhi Maidan on January 30 to end corruption
 baharhaal, yatraaen janata se jodatii hai or parivartan kaa madhyam banati hai, aisa log maanate hai
 But it will be interesting to see how far the successful visits of leaders in the state of Bihar, which has become the battleground of yatras, are successful in this desire

 This is the same Sabir Ali who came to BJP after being expelled from JDU in 2014 and his membership with BJP was canceled the very next day

 iske baad jediu ne na sirf shivahar se unka chunavi tikat kaat diya, balki unhemparty se bhi nikaal diya tha
 Naqvi had said that he joined the BJP only after being a friend of the terrorists and his membership was canceled the following day amid controversies and speculation with Muttar Abbas Naqvi
 vivaad badhane par mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne sabir ali ke bare main kiya gaya apana twit to hataa liya tha, lekin phir bhi ve apane bayaan par kaayam the
 He said that whatever i said about Sabir Ali, i still stand by him, i am still saying that he should be fired by the party
 unhone kaha maine apana twit isliye hataaya kyonki isamen daaud ibrahim kaa naam tha
 i later thought that i should not have used Dawood's name
 iske baad sabir ali ne nakvi ke khilaaf manahani kaa cese kar diya tha
 But after some time the two leaders reconciled and Sabir withdrew the case

 In his address, Romney accused Obama of failing to give global leadership to the world, which is expected by the entire world, especially major allies like Israel
 unhone vaada kiya ki yadi vah jitate hai to sainya or aarthik shaktiyon ke bal par vah america ko vishwa yuddh ke baad vaali bhoomika main laane ke liye us vakt kii videsh niti behaal karenge
 In his address at the Virginia Military Institute on Monday, Romney attacked the US Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and killed the US Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others, referring to the anti-us protests and violence in Arab countries, including the Obama regime
 Declared a failure of foreign policy
 romany ne kaha, 'yah hamaari or hamaare raashtrapati kii jimmedaari he ki vah itihaas ko aakaar dene ke liye america kii mahaan shakti kaa istemaal kare, na ki desh ko bhagya bharose chhod de
 Unfortunately the policies of the current president are not the same as our finest examples of global leadership
 'romany ne haalanki pakistan main chhipe alqaida sargana osama bin laden ko dhundhakar maar giraane main obama prashasan kii safalataa ko mana
 Regarding Afghanistan, Romney said that he would not formulate a policy based on hearsay, but by the end of 2014 he would successfully hand over the responsibility to the Afghan security forces there
 iran par unhone kaha ki vah obama prashasan kii nitiyon ko aage badhayenge
 After Romney's speech ended, White House spokesman Jay Carney said his policies were largely the same as Obama's

 Party members led by Congress president Sonia Gandhi strongly criticized Advani for her remarks
 baad main adwani ne kaha ki vah 2008 ke vishwaas mat kii baat kar rahe the, jisamen sarkaar bachaane ke liye karodon rupee kharch kiye gaye the
 Advani started discussing the adjournment motion on violence in Assam and said that UPA-2 is illegitimate
 aisa bharat ke itihaas main kabhi nahin hua
 Crores of rupees were never spent to gain votes

 After this, the ruckus intensified and UPA President Sonia Gandhi was also heard getting up in the middle

 Amid the uproar, Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar appealed to the members to remain calm and urged Advani to withdraw his words
 sonia gandhi ne bhi adwani se apana bayaan waapas lene ko kaha, jiske baad adwani ne apane shabd waapas lene kii ghoshnaa kii
 To make the situation normal, Speaker Meira Kumar asked Advani to withdraw his remarks, which he accepted
 aisa karte hue unhone spashtikaran diya ki unki tippanee upie-2 sarkaar ke bare main nahin, balki upie-1 sarkaar ke samay vishwasamat ke dauraan hue ghatnakram ke sandarbh main thi
 Advani made the above remarks at about 12 o'clock after the Question Hour, starting a discussion on the adjournment motion on the incidents of recent ethnic violence in Assam
 sadan ke nae netaa susheel kumaar scindia ne adwani kii tippanee par sakht aapatti jataate hue kaha ki vah ek varisht netaa hai or ham unka sammaan karte hai, lekin unhone apni tippanee ke dwaara puure chunaav ko avaidh qaraar de diya he, jo ham sab ke liye apmaan kii baat he

 Amid the ongoing uproar by the ruling and opposition members, Speaker Meira Kumar adjourned the house for lunch at 1 pm

 Earlier, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that the government is ready to hold debate on any subject as per the rules and conventions of the Parliament and also hoped that the opposition would extend all possible cooperation in carrying out the official work in both the Houses
 sansad kii imaarat ke bheetar pravesh karne se pehle samvaadadaataaon se baat karte hue unhone kaha, hamaari sarkaar kisi bhi mudde par sansad ke niyamon or paramparaon ke anuroop bahes karaane ke liye taiyaar he
 Asked about the BJP bringing an adjournment motion on the issue of ethnic violence in Assam, Singh said, "we consider Parliament as a forum for debate
" unhone kaha ki assam kii hinsa ke bare main unke bayaan kaa faisla is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki sansad main kya kuch hota he
 Singh said that he hoped that all parties would cooperate with the government in the smooth functioning of the two houses during the monsoon session
 is satr ke dauraan sarkaar sansad main kareeb 31 bill pesh karegi, haalanki lokapal bill abhi list main nahin he

 iske alaava spectrum, koyala block aavanton or airsel-mexis saude jaise kathith ghotaalon par bhi vipaksh sarkaar ko gherne kaa prayaas karegaa
 There will also be an attempt to suppress the misery of the government by raising cases of increasing train accidents in the last few days, including the fire in the Tamil Nadu Express train
 rail mantralay mamata banerjee ke netritv vaale trinmul congress ke paas he, jo congress kaa sahyogi dal he
 This year, the issue of lack of monsoon will also come up in Parliament in most parts of the country
 vipaksh kaa aarope he ki barish nahin hone se sookhe kii sthiti utpann ho gai he, lekin sarkaar kii usase nipatane kii koi taiyaari nahin he
 Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj said, the country is facing a big economic crisis

 Sushma Swaraj said that apart from this, her party would like clarification about the government's intention to allow FDI in retail
 sarkaar se unhone maang kii ki is mudde par yaa to vah charchaa karaae athwa sadan main aashwaasan de ki khudara kshetra main pratyaksh videshi nivesh ko anumati nahin di jaaegi
 With Pranab Mukherjee becoming President, he will now be replaced by Sushil Kumar Shinde as Leader of the House in the Lok Sabha
 sipiem ke gurudas dasgupta ne kaha, sansad ke is satr main hamaari pehali praathamikta arthvyavastha kii sankat par charchaa karana hogi, kyonki sarkaar is sachaai par pardaa daalane ko prayasarat he
 Accusing the government of not taking a clean stand in the FDI case, he said, there is no 'dancing doll' of the Parliament government
 use vipaksh kii maangon ko gambhirtha se lenaa chahie

" unhone kaha ki assam kii hinsa ke bare main unke bayaan kaa faisla is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki sansad main kya kuch hota he

 Sushma Swaraj said that apart from this, her party would like clarification about the government's intention to allow FDI in retail
 sarkaar se unhone maang kii ki is mudde par yaa to vah charchaa karaae athwa sadan main aashwaasan de ki khudara kshetra main pratyaksh videshi nivesh ko anumati nahin di jaaegi
 With Pranab Mukherjee becoming President, he will now be replaced by Sushil Kumar Shinde as Leader of the House in the Lok Sabha
