 The BJP got a majority in the Lok Sabha and the coalition suffered heavy losses
 yah pehali baar nahin tha jab bahum kam samay main hi karnataka ke matadaataaon kaa mizaaj badal gaya
 The same happened in the 2013 assembly elections when Congress got 122 seats, BJP 40, JDS 40 and others 22 seats
 lekin vidhansabha ke baad 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko 28 main se 18 loksabhaa siten milin, jabaki congress ko 9 or jedies ko 2 hi siton par santosh karnaa padaa
 The BJP had only 40 seats in the assembly, but if the Lok Sabha election results were seen in the Assembly, BJP had an edge over 132 seats
 jabaki congress 78 or jedies 14 par simat gai thi
 The volatile mood of voters was seen even after the recent Lok Sabha elections were held and the Congress won a landslide victory
 alag-alag chunaav nateezon se pataa chalata he ki karnataka ke voter sthaneey chunaav, vidhansabha chunaav or loksabhaa chunaav main apni praathamiktaayen alag-alag rakhte hai
 According to the last Lok Sabha, the BJP is ahead in 171 seats, but the question is, if the elections are held today, will the BJP retain this lead? It is difficult for the BJP to repeat the performance of the Lok Sabha Center for Development Studies (CSDS)
 ) Director Sanjay Kumar believes that if the government falls again in Karnataka in the event of a fall, then the BJP will not be able to repeat the performance of the Lok Sabha
 ve kehete hai, 'kinartak ke voter alag-alag chunaav main alag-alag praathamiktaaon ke saath vot karte hai
 In 2013, he wanted the Congress in the state but in 2014 he preferred the BJP in the Lok Sabha
 2018 main congress or jedies ke paas bahumat gaya, lekin 2019 main bijepi ne clin sweep kar diya
 This simply means that the voters of Karnataka wanted BJP at the center but wanted a non-bjp government in the state
 ''yadi aaj karnataka main chunaav hota he to isaki bahut sambhaavna he ki bijepi mukhya ladaai main to rahe lekin vah loksabhaa vaala pradarshan na doharaa paae
 Because voter preferences may be different for the state
 lekin congress or jedies ko bhi logon kii naaraazgi kaa nateeja bhugatna pad saktaa he
 Pradeep Gupta, Chief of Axis My India, says, "people elected Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha, but raised other parties in the five state assemblies
 karnataka main congress or jedies kaa chunaav purv gathbandhan vaisaa kaam nahin karegaa kyonki ye partiyaan ek duusare kii virdohi partiyaan rahi hai
 Perhaps the result of this is that in the Lok Sabha elections, voters defeated the entire family of CM Kumaraswamy
 kumaraswami ke pita or purv pradhanmantri echdi devgauda or unke bete nikhil kumaraswami ko unke garh main karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 "gupta says," People voted for Modi in the Lok Sabha, so the BJP won unilaterally in the state
 lekin jab vidhansabha chunaav kii baat aegi to bijepi ko ek majboot or lokapriy cheharaa utaarna hoga, kyonki yediurppa or narendra modi main fark he
 ' bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne purvavarti upie sarkaar kii kadi ninda karte hue kaha ki upie sarkaar main shakti ke teen centre the- tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh, congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or unke putr rahul gandhi, jiske kaaran avyavashtha paidaa ho gai
 Addressing a rally of BJP workers in Surat, Amit Shah said, “there was a situation of policy inertia in the country
 ek bhi faisla nahin liya gaya
 Nobody knew where the government was from
 
 
 yaa to yah sonia ji ke ghar se chal rahi thi yaa pradhanmantri ke ghar se yaa phir rahul baba ke ghar se
 
 
 Amit Shah's aggressive stance came after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's interview in which he said that Sonia Gandhi was an unconstitutional power, exercising real power over the PMO during the UPA regime
 iske alaava amit shah ne purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh par bhi joardaar hamalaa kiya
 - input language congress kii ek skim ne gujarat ke mukhiya narendra modi kii uda di he neend
 In order to take over the power of Gujarat, the Congress has given a lollipop to give a house under its own house scheme
 jiske chalate is form ko paane kii hode main mahilaon main jamkar gutthamguttha hui
 In cities like Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Rajkot including Surat, a 5-5 km long line is being used for this form
 2 dinon ke bheetar hi 40 lakh form bant chuke hai
 In order to woo people, the Congress is currently in a mood to create such a spectacle, and after coming to power, is also claiming to fulfill this promise
 gujarat congress ke adhyaksh arjuna modhwadiya ne kaha, 'chunavi lollypope dena bijepi kaa kaam he
 He gave a package of 1500 crores to Vanbandhu in 2007, and there is a project of 11000 crores for Sagar Khedu
 hamaara ye project ye sabhi program 1995 se the jise ham phir se laayenge
 Congress has launched its own house scheme in 3 categories
 a category main ek cameraa or rasoi ke liye 70,000 rupee bharne honge
 1,00,000 will have to be filled for a 1BHK flat in b category
 jabaki c category main 2BHK flats ke liye 1,80,000 rupee jamaa karne honge
 This bet of the Congress has woken the BJP as well as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi
 modi kaa kahana he, 'kuch log kaagaj baant kar kehete hai ki wo ghar denge
 Paper boats are not crossed across the sea
 ek dhang logon se chetane kii jarurat he
 BJP is currently busy in breaking this bet of Congress

 If he had thought of protecting women, he would never have made such a statement
 ' unhone kaha, 'vah arthhin baaten kar rahe hai

 Those who have seen 'pink' must be praising it
 film ke samvaad or sandesh, donon hi damdaar jo hai
 By the way, in the meantime a trend from the film is also becoming very popular
 dresses to teen bhi actress ne waisi hi pahanin, jaisi dilli kii ladkiyaan pahenti hai
 But Taapsee Pannu's tattoo in 'pink' is amazing
 or tabhi se yah trend hit bhi ho gaya he
 If you haven't noticed, Taapsee's collar bone has a tattoo of flying birds
 is tatu kaa arth hota he mukt udaan jo'pink'main die gaye messej se bhi judaa he
 Tattoos of these stars are the worst
 
 
 ab aap bhi'pink'kii heroin hone kaa feel lenaa chaahati hai to ye tatu banavaa sakati hai -bollywood ke ye sitare hai tatu ke krejikitna kharch or time -vaise is tarah ek celebreti kii feeling lenaa aapako zyada mahangaa nahin padegaa
 For this you will need about one hour time and Rs 2400
 ji istatu ko banavaane menitna hi time lagata he or kareeb itnaa kharch aata he
 Harminder Sohal of Tattoo Villa says that this tattoo can be made on the collar like Taapsee
 lekin is jagah par dard sabase zyada hoga
 This is the hidden meaning of 'pink'
 
 
 ungali par banavaa sakati hai lekin
 
 
 So if you are wondering where to get a tattoo like 'pink' and then fly birds on the wrist or the back of the neck
 Arm par bhi ise banavaa sakati hai
 This will make it look bigger and bolder
 vaise aap ise ungali ke pichley hisse par bhi banavaa sakati hai
 But for this, Harminder says that the tattoo will lighten quickly due to the continuous application of water and soap
 So girls, jaandaar arth vaale tatu ke shandaar dizin kii chois aapke saamne he
 So when are you making it for high flying like 'pink'! bhartiya railway apane apgredation par lagaataar kaam kar rahaa he

 prachaar ke is aakhri daur main raajnneetik partiyaan apane star prachaarkon ko aage kar rahi he
 However, these stars who have come out of politics from the glare of the film world, do not appear to be much helpful in Delhi's MCD elections

 These mainly include New Delhi, South Delhi, West Delhi, East Delhi, Chandni Chowk, North West Delhi, North East Delhi
 bataa den ki 1951 - 1956 tak dilli main sirf teen loksabhaa seat hoti thim
 These included seats in Delhi City, New Delhi and outer Delhi

 These included New Delhi, Outer Delhi, Chandni Chowk, Delhi Sadar and Karol Bagh
 1966-2008 tak dilli main loksabhaa kii saat siten thim
 These included New Delhi, South Delhi, Outer Delhi, East Delhi, Chandni Chowk, Delhi Sadar and Karol Bagh
 dilli main loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan is baar mukhya rup se muqabla bhartiya janata party, congress, or aam aadmi party ke bich he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party won all the seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav 2017 main bijepi bahumat paane main kaamyaab hui
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi attributed this to the economic reforms of the central government on which the opposition was trying to surround them
 pehle notebandi or phir jiesti ke mudde ko sadhakar vipaksh ne gujarat main bijepi ko haraane kii ummid baandhi
 So, just before the election, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley put GST on the head and won the losing bet and made the party Alexander
 haalanki pradhanmantri modi ne gujarat kii jeet par yah bhi kaha ki desh ne unke tex sudhaaron kii pahal ko sweekaar karte hue bijepi ko himachal pradesh main bhi jeet di he
 At the same time, before the party's victory in Uttar Pradesh, the Prime Minister described the demonetization decision taken in November 2016 as public approval
 pradhanmantri ne yahaan tak kaha ki desh bade aarthik sudhaaron ke liye puri tarah taiyaar he or sanket dene kii koshish kii ki aane vaale dinon main kendra sarkaar kuch ahm aarthik sudhaaron par faisla le sakati he
 Now, apart from the Prime Minister's statement on how much the country is ready for economic reforms, there is a truth
 1 july 2017 ko sansad ke ativishesh satr main madhyaraatri ko van nesan van tex niti ke tahat jiesti kii neenv rakhi gai
 This change in the tax structure of the country has been termed as the biggest economic reform in history
 is aarthik sudhaar se puure desh ko ek ekikrit bazaar main badla jaataa
 Trade between states was done without any hindrance for ease of doing business
 vahiin is sudhaar main sabase ahm paksh kaarobaar main tex chori ko rokane kii ahm kavayad karte hue kendra sarkaar kii kar se aamadani main bada ijapha karnaa tha
 Therefore, after many years of exercise, a structure of GST was created which would be successful in fulfilling its above stated purpose
 lekin 1 july ko jiesti lagu hone ke baad deshbhar ke sabhi bade kaarobaariyon ko apana puraa kaarobaar nae tex pranali ke tahat register karaane kii jarurat thi
 Under GST, any big businessman had to regularly give details of his entire business to the central government
 isse kendra sarkaar ko desh main ho rahi kaarobaari gatividhiyon kii 100 fisadi jaankaree milti or kaarobaar par tex aankalan ke kaam ko tex chori se bachaaya ja saktaa tha
 At the same time, due to the correct assessment of tax, the major increase in the central government's earnings was also expected that the biggest benefit of this tax reform would be directly and indirectly to the consumer
 pehla, jiesti se desh main upabhokta ke liye quality utpaada or seva kaa dhaancha khadaa hota jisase sasti daron par bhi uplabdh karaane kaa praavdhaan jiesti main maujuud tha
 But the focus of campaigning for Gujarat elections became demonetisation and GST
 congress ne prachaar ke shuruyaat se hi daawa kiya ki notebandi se kisaan, majdoor or chote kaarobaari pareshaan hue or isse desh kii arthvyavastha ko tagada jhatka laga
 Along with this, the Congress tried to woo small and medium businesses by making GST applicable from July 1 in the state
 congress kii yah koshish ek had tak kargar bhi dikhi jab gujarat ke kai audyogic ilaakon main kaarobaari iske virodh main utar aae
 In response, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced a huge concession in GST on products that had direct linkage to the Gujarat business
 jiesti council ne 7 oktober ko 27 utpaadon ke tex dar main katautee kaa elaan kiya
 These products provided relief to the textile industry of Surat and food products like khakhara and namkeen, including nylon and polyester, weakened the tone of the protest
 vahiin jiesti main tex chori rokane ke kai kade praavdhaan jaise niyamit kaarobaar kaa puraa byora dena tex vibhaag ko dena ko halkaa kar diya gaya jisase kaarobaariyon kaa virodh khatm ho jaae
 However, despite these cuts, the Congress was hopeful that businessmen troubled by the implementation of GST would be ready to teach the BJP a lesson
 lihaaja, jiesti ko gabbar singh tex bhi kah diya gaya
 But this stance led the finance minister to wager 'economic reform' from GST to save the party's credibility in Gujarat

 lekin ek bada sanyog yah dekhne ko mila ki sunil gavaskar ne bhi 1971 main westeindies siries ke dauraan 774 ran banaae the
 The difference is that Sunil Gavaskar then scored 774 runs in his debut series, batting strongly against the Windies, which is still the world record for most runs in a five-match debut series
 Sunil m Gavaskar : 774 runs in 5 Test series vs WI, 1971steven PD Smith: 774 runs in 5 Test series vs Eng, 2019both missed 1 Test each due to injury

 The three young poets on the stage were English, Assamese and Hindi
 shrotaaon ne kasautiyaan saamne rakh lee thim
 The new generation is seen with a more skeptical vision and prejudice and almost assuming that they have neither the vision nor the language to express their time
 lekin yuva peedi aksar isko galat sabit karti ai he
 The session commenced with Lubna Irfan's English poems and from there also became the tone of the session whose tension was not let down by Mridalu Haloi from his Assamese poems and Sudhanshu Firdaus from his Hindi poems
 gauratlab he ki raza foundation ne dilli ke triveni kala centre main ‘vaak’ naam se ek aayojan kiya
 This will be a biennial event of poems being composed in Indian languages
 is saal iskaa pehla sanskaran sampann hua
 About 45 poets from more than 15 Indian languages participated in it
 aise samaaroh aksar ateet ke vaibhav par itaraane ke aayojan ban jate hai
 Their meaning is only when new and strong voices come out along with old voices in which the outline of future is seen
 is satr main iskaa sanket mila
 There is also a consciousness of being a woman in the poems of Lubna Irfan and questionability from that perspective
 ek taraf vah kahati hai ki 'jo santulan dhaaran karti he main vah stri hum, vah jo baagh par baithti he main vah devi hum, main prayek stri hum, prayek stri main hum


 main aag hum mujhe koi jala nahin saktaa or duusari taraf puuchhati he “or jo chunata he satya, or ve prashn jo inase upajte hai, or jo ath main shuru hota he or iti main ant 
 
 jo chunata he wo swapn jise ham yaad rakhen or ve jinhen ham bhul jaaen”
 The truth found in these poems is a confrontation rather than a direct confession
 mridul haloi kii kavitaaon main vah parivesh he jo shahrati kaviyon main nahin dikhataa, mridul jab kehete hai “kehane ko or kya baaki he / manushya bhul jaataa he vahi jo yugo se kaha gaya he / or mere bhaavana ke andar itane saare log awaazahi karte hai / raat ke andhera kii tarah sannata mujhe gher letaa he"
 The poet is concerned about the ruthlessness of his surroundings, but in his mind he also wants to preserve the softness of the paddy plant and love is at the root of it all
 sudhanshu firdaus kii kavita mahatvakankshi he is kram main kavitaaon main purvavarti rachanakaaron se mili parampara samvaad bhi jisame keval sahmati nahi he
 Socioeconomic conditions come subtly into the poem
 koi nahin jaanata kahaan se aata he kalidas / koi nahin jaanata kahaan ko chalaa jaataa he kalidas / har kalidas ke jivan main aata he ek ujjain / jahaan pahunch vah rachataa he apana sarvshereshth / vahiin utarati hai parijaat-si sugandhit / swarna pankhudiyon-si chamakatin meghdoot kii panktiyaan / uske baad keval kinvadantiyaan janashrutiyaan
 
 
 The comments teenon hi kaviyon kii kavita main ek raajnneeti he lekin vah narebaaji kii nahin he, parivesh or samay saapeksh he jisame apane hone kaa bodh bhi he
 In the final session, Ashish Nandy says that the poet struggles with his self-determination the most
 or sabase acchhee kavitaayen aatmsangharsh se sambhav hoti hai kyonki yahaan sangharsh manushya bane rahane kaa he
 Hence the poems of these three affect which have the basic consciousness and appeal to remain human

 On one side she says that 'I am the woman who bears the balance, the one who sits on the tiger, i am the goddess, i am every woman, every woman i am


 i am the fire, no one can burn me and on the other side i ask Is "and the one who chooses the truth, and the questions which arise from them, and which begin in the sense and end in iti
" 
 The one who chooses the dreams we remember and the ones we forget ”
 in kavitaaon main paae hue satya ke sidhe sweekaar kii bajaay unase ek takaraav he
 In the poems of Mridul Hloi, there is an environment which is not seen in the poets, when Mridul says "what else is there to say / Man forgets what is said to Yugo / And so many people move inside my spirit / Silence surrounds me like the darkness of night "
 kavi apane parivesh kii nishthurataa ke prati chintit he lekin apane man main vah dhan ke paudhe kii komalta ko bhi bachaa ke rakhana chahta he or sab ke mul main he prem
 The poetry of Sudhanshu Firdaus is ambitious, in this sequence, the tradition of the poems from the previous creators in the poem is also not agreed
 saamaajik aarthik paristhitiyaan kavita main sookshmata se aati hai
 Nobody knows where Kalidas comes from / No one knows where Kalidas / Every Kalidas comes in life
 a Ujjain / Where reach he creates his best / Descends there Parijat-like fragrant / Golden petals-shining Rows of Meghdoot / legends only followed by legends
 
 
 tippaniyan There is a politics in the poetry of all three poets, but it is not about sloganeering, environment and time is relative, which also has a sense of being
 antim satr main ashish nandi kehete hai ki kavi sabase adhik apane aatmsangharsh se jujhataa he
 And the best poems are possible by self-struggle because here the struggle is to remain human
 isliye in teenon kii kavitaayen prabhavit karti hai jinamein manushya bane rahane kii buniyadi chetana or apil he

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne mirch powder hamale ko lekar kaaphi talkh tippanee kii he
 Kejriwal, who arrived in Sonipat on Wednesday, targeted the entire opposition for the attack on him and accused him of plotting to kill
 mukhyamantri kejariwal buudhvaar ko sonipat ke thana kala gaanv pahunche the
 Responding to the questions of journalists here, he said, 'I have been attacked 4 times in the last 2 years
 yah koi halkaa maamla nahin he
 The attacks are not being done on their own, but on the orders of someone
 humlog inaki ankhon kaa roda ban chuke hai
 These people want to kill me together
 ye log baar-baar hamalogon ke upar hamale karvaa rahe hai
 'i've been attacked 4 times in 2 yrs

 It is being told that chilli powder also fell in Arvind Kejriwal's eyes
 aaropee anil sharma dilli kaa rahane vaala he jise giraftaar kar ypi estate thane le jaaya gaya
 The attack took place at around 2
10 pm, when Arvind Kejriwal was going to have lunch
 buudhvaar ko kejariwal sonipat pahunche
 Here he gave a check of one crore rupees to the family of BSF jawan Shaheed Narendra
 iske baad patrakaron ne unase mirch powder hamale ko lekar sawaal poocha
 On this, the Chief Minister said that the parties want him dead but they will work till death
 kejariwal ne kaha
 'the last strand of my blood is also the name of the country
 aam aadmi party ke vikaas kaaryon se duusari partiyaan or sarkarein dar gai hai
 In Delhi, senior party leader and Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia alleged that BJP wants to kill him to prevent Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal from acting in the interest of the people of Delhi
 sisodiya ne mangalvaar ko kejariwal par mirch powder fenkkar kiye gaye hamale kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki hamalavar bijepi kaa kaaryakarta he
 He said, `` After all the tricks to stop Kejriwal from working, BJP wants to kill the Chief Minister
 kal kii ghatana isi saazish kaa nateeja he
 Sisodia on Tuesday demanded a probe into the presence of a BJP leader in the Delhi Secretariat at the time of the attack
 unhone kaha ki hamalavar ke fasebuk pej par mukhyamantri kejariwal ke liye gaali kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 The series was running on his Facebook page for the past one month
 uske pej par bijepi ke netaaon kii photo he
 Sisodia said that there was no statement from the Lieutenant Governor (LG) in the attack on the Chief Minister
 unhone bataaya ki grih mantri rajnath singh ne kejariwal ko phone kar kaha ki aap police main shikaayat darj kara den
 He also questioned the manner of investigation of the police and said that the way the inquiry is being done, it is clear from the police that friendship with the top leaders of the BJP is being played, because the whole incident seems to be that Top BJP leaders were aware of the attack
 apane sansadeey kshetra raibareli do din ke daure par ain sonia gandhi ne subah or shaam do udghaatan kiye
 There was a similar thing in both places
 wo tha udghaatan se pehle puja-paath
 It started with Nagar Panchayat Bhawan in Dalmau assembly constituency
 sonia ke aane se pehle hi panditji tikaa lagaakar puja archana kii saamagree ke saath unka intjaar kar rahe the
 The direction of the cameras of the media persons was also in the same direction, so that the worship of Sonia could be properly captured
 pehle puja-paath phir udghaatan kaa kaarykramate hi sonia sir par pallu daalkar puja main baith gayi
 Panditji tied the kalewa, chanted it and gave coconut in Sonia's hand
 sonia nebhi apane daahine haath se ek baar main vahiin nariyal todaa, gari kaa prasad liya, phir panchayat bhawan kaa udghaatan karne gayi
 a similar view was also seen in the opening of a road in Manharu area in the evening
 vahaan bhi panditji puja saamagree ke saath intjaar kar rahe the
 Sonia came and inaugurated after worshiping like dawn
 gauratlab he ki pehle amumangandhi parivaasapane loksabhaa kshetra main agar kisi ek dharm main aasthaa jataata dikhataa tha, to us daure main hi duusare dharm yaa dharmon ke kaarykram ke saath bhi najar aata tha, lekin sonia ke is do divasiy daure main ab tak aisa or koi kaarykram nahin he
 After all, why the Congress and Gandhi families are busy changing the image, Antony Committee in its report, to investigate the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, had also considered the Congress's inclination towards the Muslim community to be the major responsible for the defeat
 iske baad se hi congress ke bheetar manthan tej ho gaya ki chhavi main badlaav kii jarurat he
 Be it the statements of Digvijay and Salman Khurshid in the Batla case or Manmohan Singh's first assertion of minority rights over resources
 congress ab apni chhavi badalane kii jugat main he
 In successive successive politics, till now, Christianity Antony and Oman Chandy were the face of Congress, but BJP increased its penetration in Hindu votes
 to congress ne vipaksh kaa netaa hindu dharm ke ramesh chennithalaa ko chunaa
 In its recently announced 8 Rajya Sabha candidates, the party did not give a single Muslim face
 iske ulat upi or maharashtra se sitting emelsi ke tikat bhi kaat die
 Rahul Gandhi is also seen in temples, so before Sonia, Rahul Gandhi has also been seen in Kedarnath temple and after that also in all temples
 congress ke netaaon ko saaf kaha gaya ki wo alpsankhyakon ke har kaarykram main hissaa len, lekin bahusnkhyakon ke kaaryakramon ko bhi puri tarjeeh dena katai na bhoolen
 Because of this, after coming to power in 2004, the second year of losing power in 2014, this time for the first time, Sonia and Rahul were seen on the day of Holi coming to the Congress office and getting engaged
 gujarat se ai samiksha report kaa bhi asargujrat se ai andruni samiksha report main kaha gaya ki gujarat dangon par party ek khaas varg kaa paksh leti dikhi

 On being asked, Rahul said that it is only for Diwali and i get it installed every year
 haalanki, is par sonia ke karibiyon kaa kahana he ki baat dharm vishesh kii nahin he
 The Gandhi family has been and will continue to give equal respect to all religions
 sanbhal kar chhavi badalane kii chahat kyon?darasal, party chaahati he ki us par tohamat pro muslim hone kii lagi thi, jisko badalanaa he
 After all, how can she do politics at the cost of majority
 wo is baat kaa khaas khyaal rakh rahi he ki issecongress kii usee chhavi main lautejismen wo sabhi dharmon ko saath lekar chalati dikhe, kisi kii taraf jhuki hui nahin
 But the question is whether the Congress is going towards soft Hindutva
 isiilie ab congress or gandhi parivaar aahista-aahista chhavi badalane kaa mauka milte hi bhunaane kii koshish main jute jate hai
 But, it has to be kept in mind that this is a fertile land of politics
 jaraa si chook kisi kii siyaasi jameen ko banjar bana sakati he
 The new year is coming and we all take some resolution on the new year

 Follow the rule of 20-20-20
 kisi bhi cheez ko ankhon se 20 feet kii duuri par rakhkar 20 second ke liye dekhie
 Spending most of the time on the screen can also cause problems like dry eye, haddock, blurred vision
 kitaaben padhakar aap apni is aadat ko badal sakate hai
 Quit the addiction of tea and coffee - If you are very fond of drinking coffee and tea, then change this habit this time because it can prove very dangerous for your health
 sabase zyada yah aapaki neend par bura asar daalata he
 Make a habit of drinking juice or herbal tea instead of tea-coffee
 smoking ko naa kahen-ye shaayad aapke liye sabase mushkil ho lekin smoking chhodana aapke liye vaaki bahut phydemand hoga
 Even if you consider it a stress buster, it is the cause of cancer
 apni life ko jaanboojhkar mushkil banane kii kya jarurat he
 Do not quit smoking at all
 pehle cigarette kam kariye or phir dhire-dhire band kar dijie
 Do not ignore your family - In the modern lifestyle, most people forget to give time to their family during the work

 dilli ke captain virendra sahvaag ne mumbai se aath wicket kii karaari haar jhelane ke baad sweekaar kiya ki unke ballebaaj lecith maalinga kii gendon ko samajhane main naakaam rahe, jiske kaaran hamen sharmnaak haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Malinga took five wickets for 13 runs, leaving Delhi's team at 95 runs
 sahvaag ne kaha, ‘maine team baithak main bhi apane khilaadiyon se maalinga kii gendbaaji ko lekar baat kii thi or bataaya tha ki unhen kis tarah se khelaa ja saktaa hai lekin ve use samajhane main naakaam rahe
 To save his batsmen from Malinga's havoc, Sehwag also played an over maiden in the middle which according to him was part of the strategy
 unhone kaha, ‘ main pehle bhi uskaa saamana kar chukaa hum jabaki hamaare baaki ballebaaj pehali baar use khel rahe the
 It is not easy for any new batsman to cope with Malinga's yorker and slow ball and so i wanted to play him more and more
 ’sahvaag ne iske saath hi kaha ki yadi unki team ne 130 kaa score banaaya hota to vah is pich chunauteepurn hota
 He said, 'if we would have scored 120 or 130, we would have tried to defend it
 aap 96 ran ke lakshya kaa bachaav nahin kar sakate
 Our bowlers and fielders played well 'the Delhi captain also admitted that the team lacked a world-class spinner
 unhone kaha, ‘haa mujhe lagata he ki hamaare paas vishwastareey spinner nahin he lekin ummid he relof vaan dar marv aagaamee maichon main isaki kami puri karegaa or hamaare bhartiya spinner bhi behatar kaam karenge
 Sehwag refused to accept that his middle order lacked experienced batsmen
 unhone kaha, ‘hamaare paas eron finch, unmukt chand, naman ojha jaise yuva or pratibhashali ballebaaj hai
 Experience does not matter much in Twenty20
 ’sahvaag se jab poocha gaya ki kya vishwa cap kii tarah twanti 20 lig main bhi refral pranali shuru kii jaani chahie, unhone kaha, ‘iske liye samay nahin he
 Already we are under pressure to complete the overs at the right time
 aisa nahin karne par baari jurmaana bharna padegaa isliye mujhe lagata he ki ipel bina diares ke hi thik he
 It will not make much difference

 is bhaashan main bijepi ke narendra modi or aam aadmi party ke arvind kejariwal ke liye bhi sandesh the
 Read the ten important things of this speech and their political meaning
 1
 Questions were raised on the culture of PM candidate by citing the constitution itself
 ye dilachasp he kyonki duusari partiyon main kai daavedaar hai or aise main piem candidet bataanaa unki raajnneetik jarurat ban jaataa he
 While the Congress platform is being repeatedly told that there is no need to tell who our leader is
 nehru the
 Indira was rajeev the, sonia hai or ab rahul gandhi bhi hai
 2
 narendra modi ke congress mukt bharat ke naare par nishaanaa sadhate hue rahul gandhi ne kaha ki congress ek party nahin soch he
 Thinking of this country
 is dauraan unhone yaad dilaayaa ki angrejon se congress ladi thi
 Not only this, Rahul pulled his argument and took it to 3000 years history of the country
 unhone kah diya ki jo hamaari soch he
 That was the thinking of the gita-mahabharata, it was Ashoka's thinking, Guru Nanak's thinking, Gandhi's thinking
 ab masalaa ye he ki kya rahul kii is soch ko desh kii janata bhav degi
 3
 rahul gandhi ne bhaashan main ek hi popular maang rakhi
 Asked the Prime Minister for 12 cylinders for the country
 saath main yah bhi kaha ki congress raaj vaale pradeshon main mahangaai kam hogi
 It is important to listen
 kyonki mahangaai ke chalate hi congress vidhansabha main buree tarah haari
 On this Congress platform, PM is saying that farmers have benefited from inflation and Congress leaders are chanting more ragas
 4
 Rahul Gandhi has been making efforts to bring democracy to the party since his debut
 usee ke tahat enesayuai or youth congress main chunaav shuru karwaae
 Now it is said that people will elect candidates under the pilot project in 15 parliamentary constituencies
 padaadhikari or kaaryakarta vot daalkar chunenge
 This is a new experiment, but for the Congress
 aam aadmi party pehle hi aise prayog kaa daawa karti rahi he
 5
 rahul gandhi ne maan liya ki philvakt vipakshi partiyon kaa prachaar behatar he
 For this, he chose the word marketing and said that opposition parties (BJP) are selling hair to the bald
 phir aam aadmi party par nishaanaa sadhate hue bole ki nae log aae hai, jo ganjon ko hair cat de rahe hai
 Manmohan also targeted them
 bijepi ko sampradayik kaha tha or aam aadmi party par tanj kasate hue kaha tha ki sadakon se desh nahin chalata
 6
 rahul ne mahilaon ko sirf silendar ke sahare hi nahin lubhaaya
 She also said something on which mother Sonia Gandhi, sitting on the stage, also blossomed

 upi nikaay chunaav ke parinaam aane ke baad EVM par sawaal uthaane vaali saharanpur se parshad pratyaashee shabana kii pole khul gai he
 He alleged that he did not get a single vote
 is baat par sawaal uthe ki aakhir uskaa or uske parivaar kaa vot kahaan gaya? shabana or uske pati ikraam ne media main jab yah sawaal uthaaya, to iske baad yah bayaan soshal media par viral ho gaya tha
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also retweeted this statement with his Twitter handle
 haalanki ab yah saaf ho gaya he ki shabana jhooth bol rahi thi
 The truth is that Shabana, who is contesting as a councilor on ward number 54 from Saharanpur district, got 87 votes, not zero votes
 uttar pradesh ellection kamishan kii website main yah puraa aankada darj he
 When the results of the municipal elections came up, Shabana had questioned evms and said, "how is it possible that i did not even get my vote
" kam se kam meraa or mere parivaar ko vot to mujhe milanaa chahie tha
 Even before this, many times questions have been raised on evms
 saharanpur ke ward number-54 se parshad pratyaashee shabanako counting main pataa chalaa ki unhen booth number-387 or 388 par ek bhi vot nahin mila he
 At this Shabana questioned the credibility of evms
 unka kahana tha ki kam se kam unako apana or apane parivaar kaa to vot mila hi he
 Shabana said that how could it happen that he did not get his own vote? He said that we expected at least 900 votes, but that did not happen
 unhone aarope lagaate hue kaha tha ki iviem main gadabadi hui he tabhi unako booth par ek bhi vot nahin mili
 Earlier, there were complaints of disturbances in evms during voting

 general ayub khan se lekar ab tak pakistan ke tamaam netaaon ke man main yah dar rahaa he ki kashmir ko balpurvak chhinane kii unki mahatvakankshaon ke jawaab main bharat kahin yahi ranneeti na apana le
 Last month, when India responded to all the provocations in Kashmir, through a series of diplomatic, economic and military tactics, Pakistan was held in its grip, the two Sharifs running Pakistan — Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and army chief Raheel Sharif — He must have felt suffocated as if he were in the grip of a boa
 khaskar 28-29 sitambar kii darmyaani raat aatanki thikaanon ko nasht karne ke liye niyantran rekha ke paar bhartiya fouj dwaara kiye gaye saahasik sargical hamalon ne is ehsaas ko pukhta kiya hoga, jisase islamabad iskaa khandan karne ko majaboor hua
 After becoming the Prime Minister, in the face of the toughest foreign policy challenge, Narendra Modi adopted a strategy that can be called bold, brave and quick
 yah kadam isliye nirbhik tha kyonki kashmir july main jis tarah bharat ke niyantran se baahar hota ja rahaa tha or pakistan ne bharat ko peeche kii ore dhakel diya tha, modi ne usee vakt aakraamak tevar apanaaya
 He raised the issue of human rights violations in Balochistan on Independence Day and then attacked Pakistan for promoting terror in front of leaders around the world at the Group-20 meeting in China
 iske baad bharat ne antarrashtriya manch par pakistan ko alag-thalag karne kaa kaam kiya or sanyukt raashtra main uske kashmir kaa masalaa uthaae jane par pani pher diya
 This bravery was because after the Uri attack, India did not hesitate to take the option of military strikes across the Line of Control, despite the fact that there was sufficient scope to increase it
 jaankaar yah daleel de sakate hai ki pehali baar bharat ne aisa hamalaa nahin kiya he, lekin shaayad hi kabhi yah itnaa vyapak rahaa ho (dekhen reporth sarhad paar javaabi waar)
 Nor was such attacks ever publicized as much as the NDA government has done this time to send a strong message to Pakistan and the world that "enough is enough"
 " saath hi gharelu aakrosh ko bhi thama ja sake, jo udi hamale ke baad paidaa hua he jisamen 19 faujee maare gaye the
 The move was excellent because Modi had then started working on a strategy that showed the image of Theodore Roosevelt's quote: "speak with love and carry a long stick
" " videsh niti kii apni is style kaa vivaran dete hue america ke purv raashtrapati ne kaha tha, ''kisi bhi sambhavit sankat se pehle aisa kiya gaya to yah kadam utkrisht soch or nirnaayak karrwai kaa namoona hota he
 "modi and his team showed sufficient foresight and took stern action when they prepared a cautious and cautious response to Pakistan's aggression in Kashmir
 unhone hamalaa karne se pehle shatranj par sabhi mohare sahi jagahon par baitha die or uske baad icchit lakshya ko hasil kiya
 During this, Modi kept speaking with love
 kerala ke kosicode main bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main unhone udi hamale ke baad pehali baar munh kholaa or jang kii sambhaavna ko nakaarte hue udi ke doshiyon ko sabak sikhaane kaa adhikaar apane paas banaae rakhaa
 Using his superior leadership, Modi drew a line between the people of Pakistan and its commanders who harbor terror, and called on the people there to join him "in the war against poverty and unemployment"
 iske baad modi ne apana lanbaa danda ghumaya
 After sending Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj to raise the issue of Balochistan at the United Nations, Modi spoke of a review of the Indus River Water Treaty of 1960
 ise radd karne kii baat karne ke bajaae unhone yah sambhaavna jataai ki bharat jab chaahe tab nadi ke pani kaa istemaal ek hathiyaar ke taur par kar saktaa he
 It seemed that this was contrary to what he had said in Kozhikode as water was an issue that could affect the people of Pakistan
 ek adhikari is bare main samajhaate hai, ''pradhanmantri ne yah kabhi nahin kaha ki agar aap durvyavhaar karenge to ve aapako sajaa nahin denge
 "he also spoke of reviewing India's trade relations with Pakistan, including the most favored country rank
 iske baad modi ne navaj sharif ko sabak sikhaane ke liye islamabad main hone vaale dakshes sammelan main janaa radd kar diya
 After this, India convinced other SAARC members Nepal, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka to declare that they too are not going there
 iskaa sandesh saaf thah pakistan akele bharat kii samasya nahin he, balki puure kshetra ko usase dikkat he
 When Modi decided to use the army, he chose an option that had the least chance of causing a war
 do vikalpon main pehla yah tha ki 1971 kii tarj par pakistan ko tod diya jaae yaa phir pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir par kabja kar liya jaae
 These were excluded because they created a scope for nuclear war
 ek anya vikalp missile se hamalaa karke hafiz said jaise aatankiyon ko khatm kiya janaa tha, lekin yah kaaphi jokhim bharaa tha or yah pakistan ko uksaa saktaa tha
 Modi opted for a surgical attack across the Line of Control as there had been attacks across the loc earlier and both the forces were used to it, which did not go ahead
 pakistan ko kadaa sandesh dene ke baad modi ne use yah sanket diya ki unhone bhale hi nirnaayak rup se pakistan ke saath nibatane ke kaayadon ko badal daalaa he, lekin ve ab bhi rishte saamaanya karne ko taiyaar hai, basharte vah bharat ko uksaana band kare
 The declaration of cross-loc attacks was made in very cautious terms to convey that after intensifying attacks on terrorist groups, India's intention is no longer to increase tension
 desh modi ke peeche majbootee se khadaa tha, yahaan tak ki vipakshi dal bhi hamale ko samarthan de rahe the
 As one top official said, "we have abandoned the policy of strategic apathy, not restraint
" hamane pakistan main kadaa sandesh bheja he ki ham kade tareeke se or sakaaratmak rukh se apni sharton ko rakh rahe hai
 If they come forward, we are ready to open up more - connectivity, communication, even we can sell them electricity
 agar ve sochate hai ki ve aatankwaad kii niti ko kaayam rakh paaenge, tab to uski keemat chukaani hogi
 "pakistan's response is quite soft
 vahaan kii fouj or sarkaar donon ne hi hamale kaa khandan kiya he, haalanki silsilewar cabinet baithken kar rahe pradhanmantri navaj sharif or fouj kii strike kor tak fouj pramukh ke daure se saaf he ki sandesh un tak pahunch chukaa he
 Pakistan will respond to some extent, especially because there is a clash of power between the two Sharifs and the army chief, who is about to retire, wants to expand his service
 isiilie kashmir main hue aatanki hamale or pichley hafte baraamula kaa hamalaa apekshit tha, lekin jaankaron kii maane to asli chintaa desh bhar main, khaskar naagarik aabaadi ke bich bade hamalon ko lekar he
 This may initially lead to war on a limited level, which India will take over, but there will always be a danger that it may go out of control
 yah baat alag he ki afghanistan kii seemaa par aatankwaadiyon se lard rahi pakistani fouj ko is vakt bharat ke saath ek or morcha kholana baari padegaa or vah aisa nahin chaahegi
 Except China, a large number of international forces have strongly favored India
 beijing bhi haalanki upmahadweep main bad rahe tanaav se chintit he or bahut sambhav he ki vah pakistan kaa samarthan karne ke bajaae usase shant rahane ko kahegaa
 Apart from raising the issue of Indus waters and Baluchistan, Modi's strategy has done one thing that has made it possible to activate a variety of options beyond just diplomatic isolation or military strikes
 afghanistan, yuai, iran or saudi arab ke kareeb jaakar bharat darasal boa ajgar kii tarah pakistan ko hamale se pehle gher rahaa he
 Modi has also incorporated an element of uncertainty in his response, due to which Pakistan will be forced to constantly speculate about what India's next step will be
 iske alaava pakistan sargical hamale kaa khandan kar rahaa he
 Therefore, he will not be able to argue for a harsh military response
 agar usne ek baar phir aatanki hamalaa kiya, to usase bharat kaa hi paksh majboot hoga
 If this was the goal, then India would be called successful
 iskaa ek pratikul paksh yah he ki kashmir se lekar kanyakumari tak puraa bharat aatanki hamale ko lekar chabison ghante sachet he
 As seen in Pathankot and Uri, India is weak in monitoring its security forces, so it will have to take urgent measures to tighten security on the periphery (see Reporteru Strong Shield)
 kashmir lagaataar ubal rahaa he or pakistan ke saath bade hue tanaav se vahaan koi phayda nahin hua he
 Therefore, Modi will have to take some bold steps to win the people there
 donon deshon ke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaaron kaa phone par baat karnaa ek aashwastakaari sanket he ki halaat ko tanavamukt karne kii disha main kadam bad rahe hai
 The Prime Minister has shown that he is a decision leader in the case of Pakistan
 ab modi ko pakistan ke sambandh main kadai or narmi ke bich kii tani hui rassi par chalakar dikhaanaa hoga
 In Bihar, the Rashtriya Janata Dal wants to see Tejashwi Yadav in place of Nitish Kumar in the chair of power, so Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav's parents Rabri Devi and party chief Lalu Yadav are making statements to this effect every day
 nae ghatnakram main lalu yadav ne shuukravaar ko kah diya ki 'nitish ji or ham buudhe ho chale hai, humlog kitna din chalenge, aakhirkaar noujvaan log hi dekhenge
 Although Lalu also said earlier that the leader of the grand alliance is Nitish Kumar, but the future belongs to these people
 ye bachche sikh rahe hai, kaam kar rahe hai or jo log tejasvi ko mukhyamantri banane kii maang kar rahe hai un logon kaa armaan rahata he
 Earlier, Tejashwi's mother and Lalu Yadav's wife Rabri Devi had said after the meeting of the Grand Alliance of the Grand Alliance on Thursday that the public wants to see Tejashwi as the chief minister
 haalanki rabari devi ke bayaan par turant janata dal united or congress ke neton ne ye kah kar puure mudde par viraam laga diya tha ki logon ko bolne kii swatantraaa he lekin mukhyamantri nitish kumaar hi rahenge
 But after the statement of Lalu Yadav, the leaders of these two parties were certainly not surprised, but they said that by giving a statement, Lalu Yadav has given a chance to pinch the opposition spontaneously and this will create more confusion among the people about the grand alliance
 
 tippaniyan Reacting to Lalu Yadav's statement, Janata Dal United Chief Spokesperson Sanjay Singh said that the people decide who old, who will sit on the chair, but as far as Nitish Kumar is concerned, how many Chief Ministers are there in this country for the year 365 days work without a break
 or nitish kumaar ek maatra netaa hai jinke naam par janata ne ek baar nahin teen baar janadesh diya he
 It is also true that due to the leadership of Nitish Kumar, the public brought many political parties to the floor with haste, while also making many parties relevant in the politics of the state
 lekin jaanakar maanate hai ki wo chaahe rabari devi kaa bayaan ho yaa lalu yadav kaa, nitish ko nishane par rakh kar jaise ye apane putr ke liye daavedaari kar rahe hai usase aane vaale dinon main gathbandhan main ganth or badhati jaaegi
 However, immediately after Rabri Devi's statement, the leaders of Janata Dal United and Congress had put an end to the whole issue by saying that people have freedom to speak but Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will remain
 lekin lalu yadav ke bayaan ke baad nishchit rup se in donon partiyon ke netaa na aashcharyachakit chakit the balki unka kahana tha ki lalu yadav ne bayaan dekar anayas vipaksh ko chutki lene kaa mauka de diya he or logon ke bich ye mahagathbandhan ke prati or bhram failaayegaa
 The comments janata dal united ke mukhya pravaktaa sanjay singh ne lalu yadav ke bayaan par pratikriya dete hue kaha ki koun boodha, koun jawan kursi par baithegaa ye janata tay karti he lekin jahaan tak nitish kumaar kaa sawaal he, is desh main kitne mukhyamantri hai jo saal ke 365 din bina brake ke kaam karte hai
 And Nitish Kumar is a quantity leader in whose name the public has given the mandate not once or thrice
 ye bhi sach he ki nitish kumaar ke netritv ke kaaran janata ne kai rajintik dalon ko arsh se farsh par laa diya vahiin kai dalon ko rajya kii raajnneeti main praasangik bhi kar diya
 But knowing that whether it is Rabri Devi's statement or Lalu Yadav's, targeting Nitish as he is claiming for his son will increase the alliance in the days to come

 Chandrasekhar Rao announced the dissolution of the assembly eight months ahead of schedule
 haalanki iske sanket agast se hi milane lage the lekin 6 sitambar ko iskaa aupchaarik elaan kiya gaya

 trs's assessment was also that if the assembly elections were held in 2014 along with the Lok Sabha elections and Modi's magic in the state at that time, then not only in the Lok Sabha but also in the assembly elections, the BJP may be in a position to give a tough fight
 
 isliye unhone vidhansabha ko aise samay bhang kiya taaki vidhansabha chunaav, loksabhaa chunaav ke saath nahin ho saken
 This year, elections are going to be held in 4 states in December and TRS wants elections in Telangana with these states only in December
 chunki, rajya main kisi duusari party main raav ke mukaable koi kaddavar netritv nahin he isliye tiares ke log telugana vidhansabha chunaav ko ekatarfa maanate hue vidhansabha samay purv bhang karaane ke faisle ko uchit maan rahe the
 But suddenly this exact thinking started to eclipse

 Chandrababu Naidu, Chief Minister of the neighboring state of Andhra Pradesh, finally managed to tie up with his anti-congress
 vidhansabha bhang hue ek hakrata bhi nahin beetaa tha ki tidipi-congress or left party ne gathbandhan ke tahat tiares ko chunauti dene ke liye taal thonk di
 This is the first time in tdp's 35-year history that the party has joined hands with the Congress
 congress ke pradesh adhyaksh uttam kumaar reddy ne kaha he, "tiares ko haraane ke liye mahagathbandhan hua he
 Many more parties will also be part of our alliance
 ''tiares sutron kaa kahana he ki darasal party yah andaja lagane main chook gai ki is tarah kaa gathbandhan itani jaldi ban kar saamne aa jayega
 The TDP, Congress and the Left parties have come together and therefore the electoral strategy needs to be changed as soon as possible
 tiares kaa kahana he ki jis tarah se congress ne tidipi se haath milaayaa he, usase saaf pataa chalata he ki congress rajya main chunaav se pehle hi haar maan chuki he
 The people of the state have confidence in the leadership of Chandrashekhar Rao and we are able to win from any alliance
 haalanki in daavon ke baavjood hakeekat yah he ki congress or tidipi kaa vot fisadi, tiares ke vot share se kahin adhik he
 TRS got 34 in the 2014 assembly election
 3 fisadi vot mili the, jabaki congress ko 25
 2 and 14 to TDP
 7 fisadi vot mili the
 Ie 5 from TRS vote share
 6 fisadi adhik
 In such a situation, AIMIM has emerged as an important factor for TRS and tdp-congress-left alliance against them

 In the elections, the Congress can make it an issue, which can directly benefit the coalition
 lekin tidipi kaa saath use nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he kyonki naidu kii chhavi andhra ke pakshdhar kii zyada he
 If the Congress could not bring good results in the Legislative Assembly, it would also have an impact on its prospects of the Lok Sabha elections

 Though Owaisi's party is not in a position to emerge as an alternative to the TRS or tdp-congress and the Left alliance, the camp they will be benefitting from will be of benefit

 In contrast, TDP is also thinking of putting Owaisi in its court

 bjp's media coordination head of Lok Sabha elections, Ravi Shankar Prasad said here that during the 10-year rule of the Congress-led government, the economic growth rate fell from eight and a half percent to four and a half percent and in such years only one and a half crore jobs were created
 His claims of increasing the growth rate to 8 percent in next 5 years and creating 10 crore new jobs are not only a joke but a hoax
 unhone kaha ki congress kaa ghoshnaa patr ek dhokhaa patr he
 The Deputy Leader of the BJP in the Rajya Sabha said that the Congress has made such long and wide promises in its farewell time that it lacks credibility, seriousness and authenticity

 Shantakumar, a BJP MP and chairman of a high-level committee formed by the government, said on Thursday that his party had not opposed the UPA government's food security bill passed in 2013 earlier because it could have lost the party in the elections
 shantakumar ne kaha, 'hamaari party main is baat kaa chintan tha ki agar ham is bill kaa virodh karenge to hamaare vipakshi iskaa hamaare khilaaf istemaal kar sakate hai

 ' ab centre main nai sarkaar banane ke baad pradhanmantri ko di apni report main shantakumar cameti ne food security bill main kuch badlaavon ke suzav die hai, jinke tahat
 
 
 Shantakumar told the media that his suggestions would benefit the subsidy, curb corruption and reduce leakages
 haalanki is cameti kii siforeeshon kii aalochana ho rahi he
 The question is arising whether the committee's job was to correct the Food Corporation of India and suggest changes in its functioning or it was also empowered to make suggestions regarding the food security bill
 cameti ke sadsy ashok gulati ne kaha ki samiti ne khaadya se jude tamaam maamalon par rivyuu kiya he or food bill isi se judaa maamla he
 On the other hand, the Congress has strongly condemned the recommendations of the Shantakumar Committee

 By kicking on the stomach of the poor and snatching the mouth out of his mouth, this government is proving that it is a government of anti-poor and moneylenders by mind and conscience
 
 
 shantakumar ji kaa yah kahana ki bhaajapa is bill kii 67 fisadi kawarej ke khilaaf thi or usne chunaav tak chup rahane kaa man banaaya tha, yah bhaajapa kii avasarwaadia or raajnneetik beyimaani ko dikhaata he
 
 
 ' arthshaastri or iaiti dilli main professor ruthika kheraa ne food security bill ke tahat kawarej ghataane or anaaj kii jagah cash transfar kii sifarish kaa virodh kiya he
 Khera told NDTV, "the ration distribution system is improving in many states and leakages are reducing
 
 
 aise main peedies system ko majboot karne kii koshish kii jaani chahie
 
 
 Reducing coverage of people under food security will reduce corruption
 
 
 ?' Describing these recommendations as anti-people, Khera said, "if there is corruption in coal or in the distribution of 2-G or 3G spectrum and we should say that the budgets of these ministries should be cut, then people will say that we are foolish economists , But there is a cut on the rights of people and if its budget is reduced, no one opposes it

 The government on Monday night dismissed reports related to the reduction in the disability pension of the Armed Forces, saying that it had increased it significantly for the 90 per cent armed forces as per the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission
 sutron ne bataaya ki adhikari rank yaa junior kamishan adhikariyon kii viklaangata pension main 14 se 30 fisadi tak kaa ijapha kiya gaya he
 Sources said after a few hours of criticism from the Congress on the media reports, a number of negative reports were coming about the disability pension of the armed forces
 unhone kaha ki media main naatakeey khabar aa rahi he, jisamen bataaya gaya he kisargical strikemein shaamil sena kaa jawan agar ghayal ho jaataa to kis prakaar uski pension main kami aa jaati
 However, the fact is that as per the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission the pension of personnel injured in the war has not been touched
 sutron ne bataaya ki media kii khabaron main is tarah kii chhavi banane kii koshish kii ja rahi he ki viklaangata pension main katautee kii gai he
 Earlier it was reported that the Ministry of Defense has reduced the pension of soldiers with disabilities during the service by Rs 18 thousand per month
 is katautee kaa farmaan sargical strike ke agle din hi jari kiya gaya
 If a jawan gets badly injured during that operation and falls into the category of 100 disability, he would be removed from his job and the pension he received would be reduced from Rs 45,200 to Rs 27,200 per month
 kyonki 30 sitambar ko hi raksha mantralay ne viklaangata pension se judaa ek farmaan jari kar diya

 inke saath seekhney ko bhi bahut kuch miltaa he
 How was it to work in previous films with Amitabh, Akshay Kumar and other actors? 'boom' with Amitabh Bachchan did not get much opportunity to work with him
 aamir khan kaam ke liye kaaphi focus rahete hai
 Shahrukh's dialogue delivery is amazing

 This included setting up new plants, exporting to new markets, acquiring companies from host countries

 General Singh has filed a 68-page petition in the Supreme Court challenging the government's decision to set his date of birth as 10 May 1951 to 10 May 1950
 general singh ne kaha ki unhone tatkaaleen thalsena pramukh ke kehane par bharose main aakar apana janm varsh 1950 sweekaar kar liya tha
 He said that there was no agreement with the military secretary's branch behind it
 unki yachika main kaha gaya he ki prativaadee (sarkaar) ko yah spasht karne kii jarurat he ki sena ke sabase varisht adhikari ke saath is tarah kaa bartaav kyon kiya gaya jisamen prakriya or naiysargik nyaay ke siddhant kaa purna abhaav jhalkata ho, vah bhi atarni general se lee gayi raay ke aadhaar par
 General Singh expressed surprise that the Ministry of Defense did not give any clear explanation for the skepticism of the records of the Adjutant General Branch, which maintains the official record of the Army
 unhone kaha ki kisi anya praadhikaar ne bhi unki daleel ko khaarij karte hue aisa nahin kiya
 He said that it is beyond comprehension why inadvertent mistake during filling of UPSC form is being given so much importance while other records are being ignored
 apni janmatithi 10 may 1950 ke sweekaar karne kar kaaran bataate hue general singh ne tatkaaleen thalsena pramukh general deepak kapur ke saath huyi baatcheet kaa byora diya
 He said that he did so when ordered by General Kapoor
 general singh ne kaha ki bhartiya sena kii ucch parampara ko dekhte hue unke paas koi vikalp nahin tha sivaay apane varisht adhikari ke aadesh kaa paalan karne kaa
 He said that his senior officer had assured that he would take the issue to a logical end by accepting the facts
 yachika ke anusaar thalsena pramukh ne 2008 main unhen nijee taur par aashwast kiya tha ki vah janmatithi kaa mudda hal kar denge
 He said that nothing happened in this case for about three months and he wrote a letter to the then Army Chief General Cooper on July 1, 2008, requesting justice in the matter
 general singh ne yachika main kaha ki thalsena pramukh ko garima ke saath avkashgrahan karne kaa adhikaar he, haalanki unhone sweekaar kiya ki sarkaar ko unka kaarykaal nirdhaarit karne kaa adhikaar he
 General Singh termed the dismissal of his constitutional complaint regarding the acceptance of the date of birth as 10 May 1951, saying it was "illegal and arbitrary" and said that it was also a violation of his fundamental rights
 is aadesh ko khaarij kiye jane kii maang karte hue general singh ne daleel di he ki sarkaar ko unki janmatithi 10 may 1951 maanane kaa nirdesh diya jaae
 Earlier, the Ministry of Defense had said that 10 May 1950 would be considered as the official date of birth and as a result, he would take a leave on 31 May this year
 iske baad general singh ne sarkaar ko ucchtam nyaayalay main khinchaa tha
 He said in his petition that the disputes related to his age or the decision of this petition, the government has the right to determine the tenure of the army chief
 general singh ne kaha ki janmatithi ke sambandh main unki daleel ko sweekaar karne se inkaar kiye jane or sarkaar ke kadam se aam logon tathaa sashastr balon ke samaksh unki chhavi prabhavit ho rahi he
 He argued in the petition that he had the right to live a respectable life
 unhone kaha ki ‘thalsena pramukh ko garima ke saath avkashgrahan karne kaa adhikaar he
 Referring to the December 30 order of the ministry and the earlier dismissal of his case, the army chief said that these orders also ignored his matriculation certificate, records of service, promotion and annual confidential report etc
 general singh ne kaha ki unhen sabhi sammaan, padonnatiyaan unki janmatithi 10 may 1951 ke aadhaar par milin
 He has also attached several documents and records in support of his date of birth as 10 May 1951
 haalanki unhone apane aavedan main kaha he ki endie main daakhile ke liye apane aavedan main unhone asaavadhaaneevash janmatithi 10 may 1950 darj kar diya tha

 (a) Lionel Messi tamilnadu kii ammaa, ediemke supremeo or rajya kii mukhyamantri je jayalalita kaa somvaar der raat apollo hospital main dil kaa daura padane ke baad nidhan ho gaya
 On the one hand, a panel of doctors from Apollo Hospital and AIIMS, New Delhi, were in the mood to confirm this news
 duusari taraf hospital se kuch dur ediemke mukhyalay par party ke sheersh netaa nae mukhyamantri ke taur par ammaa ke kareebi o paneerselvam ko kaman dene par raay-mashvira kar rahe the
 Night 11
 30 baje medical bulatin se ammaa ke nidhan kii khabar pusht hui
 How to become Chief Minister? Paneerselvam left Apollo Hospital at 11 am half an hour before the announcement of Amma's demise and went straight to the party headquarters
 unke pahunchate hi party presidium ke chairman i madhusuthanan ne ammaa ke cabinet kaa istipha batora, paneerselvam ko sarvasammati ke saath mukhyamantri niyukt kiya or puure dalbal ke saath rajbhavan pahunch gaye
 Night 1
 30 baje rajbhavan main paneerselvam ko mukhyamantri pad kii shapath dilaai gai
 All 31 ministers who resigned from the Amma cabinet were also sworn in as Chief Ministers
 kyon bane mukhyamantri?paneerselvam teesri baar rajya ke mukhyamantri niyukt hue
 Earlier, in 2001-02 and again in 2014-15, Panneerselvam was made the chief minister when Jayalalithaa was forced to relinquish the chair
 paneerselvam ne ummid ke mutabik kabhi jayalalita ke khinche daayre ko paar karne kii koshish nahin kii
 It was also said that he had devotion to Jayalalithaa that he used to keep Jayalalithaa's picture in her pocket, shed tears for Jayalalithaa on stage as well and preside over the Chief Minister's chair in the cabinet mating
 ye bhi hai chaay bechney vaale mukhyamantripaniraselvam ke pita thik narendra modi ke pita ki tarah chaay kii dukaan chalaate the
 While the current Prime Minister Modi used to help run the family by selling tea at the railway station with his father, Panneerselvam also helped his father by working at his tea shop
 modi railway stesan par chaay bechney ke baad samay nikaalkar skool jate the or paneerselvam bhi aisa hi karte the
 Panneerselvam's father worked for party founder MG Ramachandran
 is dauraan vah chaay kii dukaan se samay nikaalkar party or party pramukh ramchandran ke chote-mote kaam kiya karte the
 It was also in the notice of Ramachandran that Panneerselvam was working at a tea shop as well as graduating from a college in Chennai
 jayalalita se unki najdiki shashikala ke chalate hui thi or mjiaar ke baad sakriy raajnneeti main mili is maukey ko unhone unka behad khaas banakar bhunaa liya
 The biggest challenge is that the current AIADMK government in the state has just four years left
 is chaar ke saal dauraanapaneeraselvan kii sabase badi chunauteeparty ko ekajute rakhte hue khud ko party ke kendra main rakhana he
 He knows that for the last four decades, the AIADMK has flourished first under MG Ramachandran and then Jayalalithaa
 or maujuuda samay main vah party ke sabase bade netaa hai
 Along with this, his main challenge is to maintain the credibility in national politics for which MG Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa are known first
 jayalalita ke daur main ediem ek kshetreey party hi thi lekin iske baavjood congress or bijepi ke liye vah hameshaa ansulajhi paheli raheen
 In national politics, she would join and leave the coalition as and when she wanted
 kya aasaan hui modi-shah kii dagar?lambey samay se ediemke bijepi ke khemen main rahete hue endie main hai
 But like before, Jayalalitha proved to be a crook for atal-advani, just like modi-shah never succeeded in helping him
 ab paneerselvam ko rajya kii kaman saunpi gai he
 At present, her image is merely that of Jayalalithaa devotee and the person who runs the party well
 yah bhi saaf he ki vah kabhi bhi jayalalita se itar apane liye independent chhavi kaa nirmaan nahin kar paae hai
 This same weakness can make the way for BJP to practice AIADM

 In Sangli, Miraj, a gang of robbers plundered as an Income Tax officer in the Hindi film "special 26"
 lekin jate-jate gharavaalon se badasluki kar baithe, jisase unki pole khul gai or 48 ghante ke andar saare aaropee salaakhon ke peeche pahunch gaye
 According to the victim Sangeeta Patil, around 9 o'clock on the night of March 27, when her family was eating, 9 people suddenly entered the house in a scuffle
 gharavaalon ko bataaya ki wo inakam tex mahakme ke adhikari hai or unhen ghar main talaashi leni he
 He had a neck around his neck and was well dressed, so he had no doubt
 thagon ne gharavaalon se capot or tijori kii chaabi lee or kareeb 4 lakh kii nakadi or 25 tola sona lekar jane lage
 But after cheating the family members, he misbehaved in a show of awe
 phir kya tha, gharavaalon ko shaq hua
 He lodged a complaint with Miraj police station

 Leading news channels have demanded a review from the government opposing the decision by the Indian Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) to allow multi-system operators (msos) to collect carriage charges from broadcasters
 samachar prasarak sangh (enbie) ne ek bayaan main kaha ki cabel tivi vitaran ke digitalykaran ke tri ke 30 april ke aadesh se hamen jhatka laga he
 The statement said that this notification has given legal legitimacy to a behavior that the NBA was hoping to end
 tri ne somvaar ko nae niyam jari karte hue emesao ko sabhi prasarakon se ek samaan karij shulk vasuulne kii anumati de di
 This type of payment was far beyond the scope of regulation
 tri ke nae niyaman ke anusaar, ‘prayek multi system oparator ko apni interconect peshkash ke niyam or sharton main prasarakon ke un channelon ke karij ke liye karij shulk kaa prakaashan karnaa hoga, jinke liye emesao ne koi aagrah nahin kiya he
 According to trai's regulation, the carriage fee will be the same for all broadcasters and will not be increased for at least two years
 is bare main niyam jari karne se pehle niamak ne prasarakon, emesao or sthaneey cabel operataron (elsio) kii bhi raay lee thi
 In an attached letter issued with the regulation, TRAI said that the News Broadcasters Association (NBA) representing the major news channels favored the regulation of carriage charges
 tamaam prasaaran companiyaan ab karij shulk ke paksh main bataayi jaati hai or isko viniamkeey paridhi main rakhe jane ke paksh main hai
 In recent decades, almost all paradigms of the ideal have been scattered around us
 na eemaandaar rajaneta rahe, na hi karmath or niyaswaarth naukarshah
 There is only one organization that remains an icon of the ideal and that is our Indian Army
 chaahe is saal april main ladakh main china kii kathith ghuspaith kaa khatra rahaa ho yaa phir chhattisgarh main maowad se upja andruni sankat, mujffarnagar kaa sampradayik danga yaa phir june main uttarakhand main utraa kudarat kaa kahar, hameshaa se hamaara bharosa rahaa he ki kuch bhi ho, sena aage aakar hamen ubaar legi
 In the recent days, despite some scandal in the army, it is the only institution which has remained completely untouched by dirty politics
 is maheene ke shuru main india today group-sivotor youth pole main pehali baar matadaata bane yuvaaon ne sena ko sabase bharosemand sanstha mana he
 It has received 20 percent more votes from the media and 40 percent more from Parliament
 isliye yah dekhakar dukh hota he ki ek naakaara sarkaar or siyasati pairokaar ban baithe ek purv general ke bich lambey chalate jhagade main bhartiya sena ko keechad main ghasita ja rahaa he
 In this fight, allegations are being made that are dangerous for the security of the country
 upie sarkaar or purv senadhyaksh general ve
 K
 singh ke bich vivaad asal main sena kii ek samvedansheel report ko lekar he
 The report alleged that the money from an undercover service was used to destabilize the Omar Abdullah government in Jammu and Kashmir and purchase equipment for covert operations
 sarkaar chah maheene tak report dabaae baithi rahi
 The General's response is equally unsympathetic
 unka kahana he ki ek sajeesh ke tahat rajanetaaon, adhikariyon or media kii ore se unhen vyaktigat taur par nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he, or jammu-kashmir main shanti banaae rakhane ke liye sena rajya ke mantriyon ko paisa detii he
 The intelligence services are suspicious, but they are very important for the security of the country
 aise samvedansheel maamalon ko kabhi bhi sadak par nahin uchhaala janaa chahie, kisi sarkaar yaa senadhyaksh kii ore se to bilkul bhi nahin
 Now military secret is being discussed in public
 dipti editor sandip unnithan ne is baar kii ek khaas rapat main sena ke bheetar upji kuntha kaa khulaasa kiya he
 It explains why General Singh formed the Technical Support Division
 yah divijan kaise kaam karata tha or general ke ritair hone ke turant baad ise kyon bhang kar diya gaya? unnithan kehete hai, ‘‘sena phir pareshaan he ki use raajnneeti main ghasita ja rahaa he, jisase vah hameshaa dur rahi he
 At the time of accusing General Singh, the smell of political enmity is being felt
 15 sitambar ko haryana ke rewadi main ek jansabha main bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ke saath singh ke manch saz karne ke baad hi un par ye aarope lagaae gaye
 But the general's response was equally irresponsible
 unhone ek behad samvedansheel maamle ko aapasi ladaai kaa vishay bana diya
 The fight for this narrow political interest has certainly affected the country's international prestige and military morale, which is very sad
 UPPSC main aarakshan kii nai niti par sunwaayee ajuttar pradesh lok seva ayog kii nai aarakshan niti par aaj elahabaad hoicourt main sunwaayee he

 thakare kaa daawa he ki 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main emenes ne acha pradarshan kiya tha or is baar ke chunaav main unki party ko badi jeet milegi
 However, Raj also believes that his politics is limited to Maharashtra
 raaj ne kaha, 'jaise gujarat kaa swabhimaan he, vaise maharashtra kaa bhi swabhimaan he
 All the leaders talk about their state
 modi ke kisi bayaan se meri bhoomika nahin badalegi

 He says, 'MNS has not used Modi's name
 hamaari ekala chalo kii niti rahi he
 i had never asked anyone about this before starting the party
 'upi se jude amitabh ke vigyaapan (upi main he dam
 
 
 ), Raj also gave clarification on the controversy

 Amitabh is not an ambassador of any state
 ' raaj ne yahaan tak kah diya ki amitabh, lata mangeshkar or sachin tendulkar desh ke ambesder hai

 Shaira Bano filed a petition in the Supreme Court for the emancipation of personal law from the clutches of perverted traditions, so that divorce-e-biddat (instant triple talaq) is declared invalid
 kisi bhi virdohi ne teen talaak par aitraaj nahin kiya, balki unhone 'muslim mahilaon ke hiton' ke naam par kii ja rahi raajnneeti kii manshaa par aitraaj kiya
 He argued that protecting her economic rights would enable her to be far more capable than separating from the marital relationship, because such a relationship would only be based on the fact that the husband did not say divorce three times in a row
 aise virodhiyon ko 'daastaa samarthak' or 'chhadam dharmanirpeksh' qaraar diya gaya
 Finally, the Supreme Court gave a balanced verdict, declaring the divorce-i-biddat illegal, in which religious freedom was intact and at the same time curtailed the distortions of the orthodox
 ab sarkaar ne 'daastaa samarthakon' kii chintaa ko darkinar karte hue sansad main ek vidheyak rakhaa he, jo na keval sarvocch adaalat ke faisle ko doharaata he, balki isamen teen talaak ko aparaadh ghoshit kiya gaya he
 The statement concerning the purpose and cause of the bill is confusing: it claims that the verdict has confirmed the government's stand
 kisi bhi vidheyak ko kisi aise daawey kii jarurat nahin hoti, yah sirf dushprachaar he, yah is vidheyak kaa uddeshy nahin he
 The statement claimed that the Supreme Court's verdict has failed to prevent triple talaq and it is still in practice
 isliye iske ulanghan ko dandatmak karne kaa prastaav kiya gaya
 There are no such figures or details available to show that declaring it a crime will serve what purpose which is not legally possible after this decision
 yah vidheyak tathakthith 'chhadam dharmanirpekshatavaadiyon' kii is ashanka ko hi majboot karata he ki yah musalmaan mahilaon ke bare main nahin he; pitrusattatmak praaroop main yah vidheyak musalmaan mahilaon ke maujuuda adhikaar ko hi kam karata he
 First, it declares the triple talaq illegal (which it already is), after which the woman concerned has the right to take a minor alimony from the husband
 is tarah se yah vidheyak mahila ke kharch se sambandhit aarthik adhikaron ko simit karata he, jabaki yah adhikaar use mahila sangrakshan evam gharelu hinsa adhinium, 2005 main praapt he, jiske jariye use apane vaivaahik ghar kii tarah kii jeevanstyli ko puraa karne ke liye uchit bhatta maangane kaa adhikaar praapt he
 Secondly, the Bill provides for the protection of minor children under the protection of women after divorce
 yah praavdhaan dharmanirpeksh sangrakshan kanoon main kiye gaye abhootpurv parivartan se mail nahin khaataa
 It violates the jurisdiction of the custodial courts on matters of protection according to the welfare of the child protection principle
 teesraa, kisi vyakti ko jail bhejne ke saath hi use muaavja dene kaa nirdesh atirikt rup se utpeedat karne jaisaa he, kyonki yah ek aisa aparaadh he jo teen talaak kaa uccharan karne se pehle ho hi nahin saktaa or usase pehle uskaa koi kanoonee prabhaav bhi nahin hota
 The 'offense' of being called a three-time divorce is treated as if it were continuous physical, mental or sexual harassment of the wife, in addition to a maximum sentence of three years under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code
 
 iske saath hi, vidheyak main teen talaak ko mahila sangrakshan or gharelu hinsa adhinium ke antargat aane vaale kisi bhi aparaadh kii tulana main bada aparaadh bana diya gaya he
 Amidst the noise of 'misuse' of the law, it may be nice to see Muslim men being targeted when you consider that a person can be convicted on the basis of his wife's oral statement that he has given her three Is divorced
 bachi khuchi kasar centre sarkaar kii haal hi main kii gai is ghoshnaa ne puri kar di ki ab mahilaayein bhi bina kisi purush ke haj par ja sakengi
 The government did not think it necessary to say that this arrangement was done by Saudi Arabia and India had nothing to do with it
 isse fark nahin padegaa ki yatra karne vaali mahilaayein bharat se hai, or unhen kisi purush ke bina saudi arab main pravesh kii ijaajat nahin hogi
 The point is that the government wants to target the Muslim community and at the same time show that it is the messiah of the women of the community
 kya is vidheyak kaa masauda taiyaar karte samay vaaki musalmaan mahilaon se salaah lee gai?malvika rajkotia vakil hai or bharat main vivaah or talaak kanoon par kendrit kitaab intimesi andan kii lekhika hai Congress has released its list of 29 candidates on Thursday after ticket distribution in the assembly seats of Rae Bareli and Amethi districts

 SP has already appointed its minister Gayatri Prajapati as candidate from Amethi
 congress kii list main raibareli ke bahubali netaa akhilesh singh kii beti aditi singh kaa naam bhi he

 Owaisi said that if there were regional parties here, the game would have been different
 ovaisine kaha ki jis tarah se 2014 main gujarat, rajasthan, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh, dilli main bijepi ko jeet mili waisi 2019 main nahin milegi
 The Modi government's peak is now over

 In Gujarat, Modi has created his image as a man of development, Rahul Gandhi also talks about development in his own way
 narendra modi bade raajnneeti ranneetikaar he
 He does politics in a bold style
 party ke baahar hi nahin party ke bheetar bhi wo apane virodhiyon ko sir nahin uthaane dete
 Just before the Gujarat elections, he showed Sanjay Joshi the way out

 raajnneetikpartiamb samaj gayi hai adhik se adhik logon tak pahunchane kaa sabase behtareen jariya soshal media he
 Whether it is BJP or Congress, both are preparing election strategy through these social media
 rajaneta bhi ab ye maanane lage hai ki vartmaan main logon tak pahunchane kaa sabase acha jariya soshal media he
 Not only this, through social media, these parties can become headlines at any time
 inke dwaara kiya hua twit turant khabar ban jaataa he
 This is the reason that now political parties have prepared special units for social media
 isamen baqayada log kaam karte hai, puri ranneeti taiyaar karte hai or party kii pal-pal kii jaankaree kii apadet dete hai
 Recently there was a special presence of social media in the BJP office
 najaara kuch yun tha, dopaher kaa vakt, bijepi ke 11 ashoka road ke daftar ke bade haul main mediakarmiyon kaa jamaavada chaaron ore camera, trypod, ypod or mike, patrkaar aapas main baat karte hue
 One of these cameras was installed at the end of the hall and 22-year-old MCA students operating from the Information and Technology Department of the BJP
 hirendra apane laptaap se bijepi kii puri press conference party ke internet tivi channel 'yuva' par dikhaa rahe the
 Barely 20 meters away, Hirendra Mehta's aide Navrang SB was monitoring the live telecast being shown on the 'yuva' channel at a corner within the BJP headquarters
 yahaan se ravishankar prasad dwaara di ja rahi soochna ke mukhya binduon ko uthaakar twitor or fasebuk par apadet kiya ja rahaa tha
 Highlights of the entire conference were available to the reader on social media
 mehta or navrang bijepi ke 100 majboot vibhaagon ke sadsy hai
 These departments keep track of the activities of the party in the social networking site
 vartmaan main soshal netwarking site ke mahatv ko dekhte hue bijepi ne das sadasyeey sanchaar or prachaar samiti kaa gathan kiya he
 The committee is headed by Digvijay Singh and is joined by Manish Tiwari, Ambika Soni, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Deepender Hooda, Rajiv Shukla, Bhakta Charan Das, Anand Adkoli, Sanjay Jha and Vishwajit Singh
 bijepi ne 2014 ke chunaavon ke liye soshal media ko apni chunavi ranneeti kaa mahatvapurn hissaa banaaya he
 Digvijay Singh says, “the importance of social media cannot be ignored
 'is samooh kaa mukhya uddeshy deshbhar seyuva congressor rashtriya chaatr sanghathan se violentir jutanaa he
 Recently, the color of social media was seen in the arrest of Akbaruddin Awaisi on 8 January
 aawaisi kaa bhadakaau bhaashan utyub par bahut teji se failaa
 Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement was the highest on Twitter in 2011
 isi tarah 2012 main dilli gangrape ke khilaaf virodh pradarshan bhi soshal media main khub bana rahaa
 Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tiwari says, "this change has now been accepted
 ham ab maan chuke hai ki fasebuk, twitor or utyub ko raajnneetik madhyam banaaya ja saktaa he
 'the presence of social media politics is a thought-provoking politics for the 2014 elections and beyond,' says the Congress
 tiwari ne 2011 main do baar apana twitor acount band kiya he kyonki usamen abhadra baaten post kii jaati hai
 But even after this, Tiwari says that just as social media has a negative aspect, there is also a positive aspect
 media agenda kii settinginternet and mobile association of india ke aankadon ke mutabik bharat main 137 milian loginternet kaa istemalkarte hai, 68 milian logon kaa fasebuk main account hai or 18 million log twitor par hai
 These figures are constantly increasing
 raajnneetik kshetra main soshal netwarking site kaa mahatv isliye bhi jaruri ho gaya he pehla isse bharat kaa madhyam varg jud gaya he or doosraa isamen koi raajnneetik soochna dene se pehle kisi editor, news ankar se nahin guzarana padataa
 If you directly connect with people, then there are many benefits
 iske alaava iskaa ek or phayda he ki raajnneetik party apana agenda media tak isi ke jariye aasaani se pahunchaa detii he
 For example, a picture of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's meeting of Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari was posted, after which the media picked up this news
 ab bijepi or congress kii soshal media main sakriy rahane vaali team kaa kaam twitor, utyub, internet, tivi feed, mobile aplicoshan, blog ko acchhee tarah sanbhaalanaa he
 This keeps the flow of information right, the party connects directly with the public and the media also gets the news from here
 bijepi kaa maananaa he ki internet par milane vaali lokapriyata 2014 main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaavon main vot bank ko badhayegi
 The political party's social media handling group also maintains its data
 kolkata main mamata banerjee kii trinmul congress pehali aisi kshetreey party he jo soshal media se judi
 There were three levels of people in this team, IT people, party members and volunteers
 iskaa puraa unit derek o brain ne taiyaar kiya tha or ise trinmul yuva netaa or mamata banerjee ke bhattije abhishek banerjee chalaate the
 Congress leaders deny that the BJP will get the benefit of being the first to join the social networking site
 'soshal media kii khaas batahe ki isaki pahunch dur tak he
 Manish Tiwari says, this does not require you to connect with every single force, your information reaches 2000 people directly
 ' yaa phir shashi tharur jaise maamle main soochna 1
 Your talk reaches 6 million people
 shashi tharur soshal media main bahut sakriy rahane vaale rajanetaaon main se ek he
 But activism in social media has also caused trouble for them many times
 apane twit ko lekar tharur kai baar vivaadon main pade hai
 But overall, people associated with politics have understood that in today's era, social media has a great importance to make space among the youth, urban people and it cannot be ignored
