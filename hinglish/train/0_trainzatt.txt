 It is believed that PM Modi has shocked many ministers through cabinet reshuffle
 lekin asal main is pherbadal ke peeche piem modi nahin balki unki special team kaa haath tha
 This special team researched mps and ministers
 kai maanakon ke aadhaar par number die gaye the
 Surprisingly, only 10 ministers got hundred of hundred marks
 iske tahat mantriyon or saansadon ko matadaataaon ke rukh, sansad main pradarshan or mantralay main kaam ke aadhaar par number die gaye the
 Discipline, caste, ideology were also standardized to give points to mps
 'da indian express' kii khabar ke mutabiktop mantralyonko is prakriya se dur rakhaa gaya tha
 This formula was prepared by PM Modi and Amit Shah together
 aankalan amit shah ke netritv main kiya gaya tha or isamen rajnath singh, sushamaa swaraj or nitin gadakari ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya
 Smriti Irani's stature has been reduced directly to the message that discipline will be given the top position in the party
 aisa mana jaataa he ki smriti ne kai baar pradhanmantri modi or aresas ke sujhaaye naamon ko bhi nazarandaaj kar diya tha
 Of the 282 BJP mps in the Lok Sabha, 165 are those who have reached Parliament for the first time
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki desh main modi kii lahar hone kii vajah se inhen jeet mili
 One of the aims of conducting research was to find out the ground hold of these mps

 Meanwhile, BJP MLA Bramhadutt Dwivedi is said to have played his life and rushed the SP mlas and supporters

 khud mayawati bramhadatt dvivedi ko bhai kehane lageen or saarvajanik taur par kahati raheen ki apni jaan kii parvaah kiye bina unhone meri jaan bachaai thi
 For information, let us know that Brahmadatta was a servant of Dwivedi Sangh and he also knew how to handle lathi, so he had a fight with armed goons with a stick
 yahi vajah he ki mayawati ne bhi unhen hameshaa apana bada bhai mana or kabhi unke khilaaf apana ummidavaar khadaa nahin kiya
 Mayawati continued to oppose the BJP across the state, but campaigned for Brahmadatta Dwivedi in Farrukhabad

 The mlas sitting in the Common Hall (bahujan Samaj Party mlas) quickly closed the main gate, but the herd broke it open
 phir ve asahaay basapa vidhayakon par tut pade or unhen thappad maarane or latiyaane lage
 It is said that at least five BSP mlas were dragged and forced into vehicles on the outside of the guest house which took them to the Chief Minister's residence
 in vidhayakon ko raajbahadur ke netritv main basapa vidrohi gut main shaamil hone ke liye or ek kaagaj par mulaayam singh sarkaar ko samarthan dene kii shapath lete hue dastakhat karne ko kaha gaya tha
 Some of them were so scared that they signed it on blank paper
 vidhayakon ko raat main kaaphi der tak vahaan bandi banaae rakhaa gaya, jis samay atithigrih main basapa vidhayakon ko is tarah se dhar kar dabocha ja rahaa tha, jaise murgiyon ko kasaai khaane le jaaya ja rahaa ho, kamaron ke set 1-2 ke saamne, jahaan mayawati kuch vidhayakon ke saath baithi thim

 andar aane vaale aakhri varisht basapa netaa aarake choudhary the, jinhen sipaahi rashid ahamed or choudhary ke nijee rakshak lalchand kii dekharekh main bachaa kar laae the
 The mlas hiding in the rooms were instructed by Lalchand to lock the doors from inside and they had just closed the doors so that a mob from the crowd roamed the corridor and started banging the door
 mayawati ko do kanishtha police afasaron himmat ne bachaaya
 These were Vijay Bhushan, the House Officer (SHO) at Hazratganj station, and Subhash Singh Baghel, who was the SHO (VIP), who took some of the soldiers along and pushed back the crowd with great difficulty

 This all went on for over an hour
 kai basapa vidhayakon or kuch police adhikariyon ke ye bayaan stambhit karne vaale the ki jab vidhayakon ko apharan kiya ja rahaa tha or mayawati ke kamaron ke akraman ho rahaa tha, us samay vahaan lakhanu ke senior suprintedent of police opi singh bhi maujuud the
 According to eyewitnesses, they were just standing and blowing cigarettes
 akraman shuru hone ke turant baad rahasyatmak dhang se, atithi grih kii bijli or pani kii supplai kaat di gai-prashasan kii mileebhagat kaa ek or sanket
 The situation there improved only after the District Magistrate of Lucknow arrived there
 unhone krodhit bheed kaa dat kar muqabla karne kii himmat or jaagrukta kaa parichay diya
 The District Magistrate, together with SP Rajiv Ranjan, first pushed the members of the mob outside the confines of the guest house, who were not mlas
 baad main police ke atirikt bal sanghathanon ke aane par unhone sapa ke vidhayakon samet sabhi ko rajya atithi-grih ke daayre ke baahar nikalava diya
 However, to do so, he had to resort to the lathi charge of the mlas
 phir bhi sapa ke vidhansabha sadasyon ke khilaaf kaarywahi na karne kii mukhyamantri ke karyaalay se mili chetavanee ko ansuni karke ve apane faisle par date rahe
 The transfer order was issued to the District Magistrate with immediate effect after 11 o'clock at night, as a result of not doing his duty without fear and favor
 jaise hi rajyapal ke karyaalay, centre sarkaar or varisht bhaajapa netaaon ke dakhal dete hi zyada se zyada raksha dal vahaan pahunchane lage, atithi grih ke andar kii sthiti niyantrit hoti gai
 When the defenders took in and out of the building, the crowd started shouting, shouting slogans, threats and slogans
 mayawati or unke party vidhayakon ke samooh ko jinhone apane aap ko kamare ke set 1-2 ke andar band kiya hua tha, yakeen dilaane ke liye jila magistrate or anya adhikariyon ko baar anurodh karnaa padaa ki ab khatra tal gaya tha, or ve darwaja khol sakate the
 By the time they opened the door, it had been quite a night
 isi ke baad se mivati or mulaayam singh ke rishte kharaab ho gaye
 Since then, there has been no alliance between the two parties neither pre-election nor post-election for 24 years

 hindustan kii raajnneeti main aaj kii taarikh yaadgaar hone ja rahi he
 The swearing-in ceremony of the Aam Aadmi Party government is going to be held for the first time in the country at the historic Ramlila Maidan in Delhi
 khaas baat yah he ki samaaroh main kisi tarah kaa viipi tamzam nahin hoga
 As the Chief Minister of Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal will have a 'coronation', who only turned the direction of politics on his insistence against corruption and got a name in the history of politics
 kejariwal or unki cabinet ke sabhi 6 bhavi mantri shapath grahan samaaroh main baari-bharkam suraksha, tamzam yaa laav-lashkar ke saath nahin, balki aam aadmi kii tarah hi metro main savaar hokar pahunchenge
 Apart from Anna Hazare, Kejriwal's former aide Kiran Bedi, Justice Santosh Hegde and Admiral Ramdas, there is no VIP arrangement for the swearing-in ceremony
 khaas or aam ke saath kejariwal ke parivaar ke log bhi usee darshak ddeergha main virajman hokar dilli main aitihaasik shapath grahan ke gavaah banenge, jisamen dilli or desh ke duusare hisson se aae aam log maujuud honge
 How many pages of history have been fabricated in Ramlila Maidan in Delhi
 hindustan main badlaav kii siyasat kaa ek or panna aaj isi ramlila maidan main phir itihaas kii tarikhon main darj ho rahaa he
 The person whose name would have been written at the top of that page of history is Arvind Kejriwal
 mahaj 28 maheene pehle isi ramlila maidan main bhrashtachar mukt bharat ke liye ek kranti ne janm liya tha
 At this Ramlila ground, a government in Delhi is going to take oath, whose purpose is to end corruption
 dilli kii janata ne aam aadmi party ke netaaon kii saadagi, sachai or nishtha par jarurat se zyada bharosa kiya, to aam aadmi party kii sarkaar bhi koshish karegi ki janata kaa bharosa nahin toote
 The party's effort is that there is no difference between statement and action
 ramlila maidan main hone vaala shapath grahan sirf kejariwal kii tajposhi kaa hi shapath grahan nahin he, balki dilli ke saath puure desh kii ummiido kaa shapath grahan bhi he
 However, the Aam Aadmi Party will have to make the historic oath meaningful by forming the government and also meeting the expectations of the people
 janata kii shikaayatein sunne ke liye modi sarkaar nai pahal karne vaali he
 In this regard, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch a new website on Wednesday
 maujuuda public web interphes kii jagah ab 'pragati' naam kaa nayaa portal hoga
 Correction in corruption situation in India
 Let us tell you that PM Modi interacts with the Central and Chief Secretaries through video conferencing every month
 buudhvaar ko is samvaad ke dauraan hi pragati portal launch kiya jayega
 However, during the Manmohan government, the public used to register their complaints on the "PMO CPGRAMS" portal
 is website par bhrashtachar / duraachaar kaa ek section tha
 But many sub-sections have been created in this category on Pragati portal
 bhrashtachar category ke andar 9 sab category honge
 Through this, the general public can file complaints of corruption in different government departments in the appropriate section
 nae portal main telecom, railway, department of financial services, urja mantralay, petroleum mantralay, baari udyog mantralay, shahari vikaas mantralay or anya mantralayon se judi shikaayatein alag-alag section main darj karai ja sakengi
 The government's effort is that public grievances reach the right platform and right department
 sarkaar ne jis tarah se vibhinn mantralayon ke sab-section banaae hai, usase saaf he ki sarkaar ko bhi in vibhaagon main sabase zyada bhrashtachar hone kii sambhaavnaaen najar aati he

 They also have to deal with all these expectations

 'sri Lanka is an important series for Sri Lanka' Sri Lankan a coach and also coach of Board President XI during the three-day practice match, Kaluvitarna said that the upcoming series of three Test matches is also very important for Sri Lanka
 unhone kaha, ‘srilanka ke liye yah siries kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 We did not do well in the last series against Pakistan and we have to find a way to come back ourselves because how we will progress in future will be the main factor for that
 iske alaava srilanka sangakaara ke liye siries jeetne ke liye koi kasar nahin chhodana chahega
 Earlier, India had drawn the only practice match before the series starting on August 12, about which Kaluvitarna said that this result will not matter in the series

 Ajinkya Rahane scored a century in the first innings for India
 bhartiya gendbaajon visheshkar eshanth sharma or aar aswin ne acha pradarshan kiya lekin ballebaajon main rohit sharma, kohli or riddhimaan saaha nahin chal paae
 It is difficult to speak about the combination though despite the poor performance of the batsmen, India is thinking of landing five bowlers in the first Test
 is bare main kaaluwitarna ne kaha, ‘bhartiya team pichley kuch samay se aisa kar rahi he or yadi ve yahaan bhi vahi ranneeti apanaate he to yah hairaani bharaa nahin hoga
 He said, "all his bowlers have done well here but it is difficult to say what their combination will be
" jab tak ham gaale kii pich ko nahin dekh lete tab tak yah anumaan lagaana mushkil he ki ve teen tej gendbaajon or do spinneron ke saath utrenge yaa nahin
 He usually lands with three fast bowlers and two spinners
 unke kuch gendbaaj acchhee ballebaaji bhi kar lete hai or aise main koi bhi team test cricket main paanch gendbaajon ke saath utarana pasand karegi

 The license of 57 pilots expired 30 to 60 days ago

 Jet Airways had the maximum expiration of 130 pilots

 Those whose license has expired more than 60 days have been suspended, while those whose license has expired more than 1 month have been warned

 After this milk is delivered to the needy children
 kaise surakshit rakhaa jaataa he doodh?sabase pehle madar milk bank main doodh donnet karne vaali mahilaon ke swasthya kii puri jaanch kii jaati he
 In this investigation, it is ascertained whether the woman concerned has any disease
 iske baad doodh ko mines 20 degree par rakhaa jaataa he, jisase yah doodh kareeb chah maah tak kharaab nahin hota he
 Which states are ahead? According to the data released in the year 2018, Rajasthan has the highest number of (13) mother milk banks
 iske alaava maharashtra main (12), tamilnadu main (10) madar milk bank hai
 Chennai is named after these states in this list
 amaara naam ke human milk bank ne breast milk foundation ke saath milakar dilli-ensiaar main isaki sevaayen shuru kii hai
 Why mother's milk is necessary for the baby? Mother's milk is a complete diet in which all the nutritional elements needed by the child are found in the right amount
 inhen shishu aasaani se hajam kar letaa he
 Protein and fat present in breast milk are also more easily digested than cow's milk

 One thing came out in research, which also surprised the researchers
 research main paaya gaya ki jin purushon kaa kad 5
 Less than 9 fit, sex frequency is more than men of height
 is research ke liye 20 se 54 saal kii umr ke 531 logon ko liya gaya tha
 Obesity and other metabolic diseases play an important role in deteriorating sex relationship with aging
 haalanki research main ye baat bhi saamne aayi he ki 45 saal se kam umr ke logon main is tarah ke lakshan nahin paae jate hai
 Researchers have concluded in their research paper in Discovery magazine that people should focus on preventing obesity in order to maintain their quality of life and sexual health

 Meanwhile, there is a lot of opposition to the traditional seat of Aurangabad Jitan Ram Manjhi being moved to quota
 yahaan se nikhil kumaar kii ummidavaari tay maani ja rahi thi, lekin achaanak is seat ko ham party ko de diya gaya
 We party has decided to field JDU MLC Upendra Prasad from here
 congress main iskaa jamkar virodh ho rahaa hai
 Road activists from Aurangabad were protesting at the state office of the Congress
 unhen vishwaas hi nahin tha ki nikhil kumaar kaa tikat bhi cat saktaa hai
 This decision of the grand alliance may have an impact on the Rajput voters
 aurangabad jila congress cameti ke adhyaksh aravind kumaar singh ne kaha ki agar unki baat nahin maani gai to wo samuhik istipha de sakate hai
 Nikhil Kumar has been contesting from Aurangabad since 2004
 2004 main wo yahaan se jite the, lekin 2009 or 2014 main wo loksabhaa chunaav haar gaye the
 The family background of Nikhil Kumar, a 1963 batch IAPS officer, has been political
 unke pita chote sahab bihar ke mukhyamantri ke saath-saath 7 baar loksabhaa main aurangabad kaa pratinidhitiv kar chuke hai
 His grandfather, Anugraha Narayan Singh, was also a great freedom fighter and heavily dominated in the politics of Bihar, he became the first Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar
 aurangabad loksabhaa kshetra raajput bahul he, isliye ise bihar kaa chitudgarh bhi kaha jaataa he
 Barring one or two cases, only the Rajput candidate has been winning from here
 vartmaan bijepi saansad susheel kumaar singh bhi rajupat jati se hi aate hai
 But the discussion of giving this seat to the party from the Mahagathbandhan and its candidate Upendra Prasad's descent from here has made the Rajputs of Magadh region nervous
 unhen lagata he ki ek seat jis par hameshaa lagbhag rajput hi jitate rahe hai, use gaiyr rajput seat banane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 The supporters of Nikhil Kumar claim that this decision of the grand alliance may affect half a dozen seats in that area
 nikhil kumaar kii chhavi saaf-suthri rahi he
 He has been the Police Commissioner of Delhi as well as DG of Indo Tibet and NSG
 2001 main ritairement ke baad 2004 main pehali baar unhone raajnneeti main kadam rakhaa or unki jeet hui
 However, he was defeated in the subsequent two elections
 nikhil kumaar nagaland or kerala ke rajyapal bhi rah chuke hai
 Nikhil Kumar's father Satyendra Narayan Sinha was a seven-time MP from Aurangabad seat
 paanch baar wo congress ke tikat par jite or 2 baar janata party kii tikat par
 He left the Congress opposing the Emergency and won the 1977 and 1980 elections on a Janata Party ticket
 phir 1984 main wo congress main shaamil ho gaye
 Nikhil Kumar's supporters have accused the party of selling tickets
 unka aarope he ki bihar prabharee shakti singh gohil, pradesh adhyaksh madan mohan jha or prachaar abhiyaan ke adhyaksh akhilesh singh ne milakar sajeesh rachi he or nikhil kumaar kaa tikat kaat diya
 It will also have an impact on Sasaram, from where former Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar could be the candidate
 lekin congress ke sutron kaa kahana tha ki aurangabad se congress ke ek or ummidavaar bade jor shor se lobing main lage the, bihar sarkaar ke purv mantri avadhesh singh
 The party says that there should be no conflict between the two, hence such a decision was taken

 vah balance bhi kamaal he
 'dilip Vengsarkar i don't think the next Sachin is possible
 koun hoga, jo 15-16 saal main khelnaa shuru kar de or itane lambey vakt tak fitness or form banaae rakhe
 i remember that in the eighties, Sachin was making a splash in school cricket
 tab mere dost vasu ne bataaya ki dilip is ladke ko jarur dekho
 The Inter School final was against Anjuman Islam
 sachin is mauch ko khel rahe the
 i went after Vasu's suggestion
 sachin ne teen sau ran banaae

 i said if i do not practice, i will train
 opshanal seshan rakhaa, jisko batting kerani he karo
 a boy came
 bolaa, main karuunga sar
 We said, let's fear spin, we will spin
 usne kya kiya ki centre main wicket kharaab thi
 So there was clean ground on the side of the net

 You can come to my house anytime
 aaraam se miloongaa
 But the case is the opposite here
 yahaan to cricket ke liye jo deewangi he, to is cheez kii ummid bhi nahin kii ja sakati
 Lara said, 'I don't have a son
 agar wo hota or utyub par meri batting ke video dekh rahaa hota, to main ise band karne ko kahata or bolta ki dekhnaa he to sachin kaa batting style dekho
 Watch her video
 uskaa tarika aisa he ki har player ko follow karnaa chahie
 Waqar Younis, the former captain of Pakistan, recalled Waqar Younis, the start of his career with Sachin

 He worshiped cricket, as people worship him here
 shaayad yahi vajah he
 "I am proud that i started Test cricket with Sachin Tendulkar," Waqar said
 ye bahut khaas tha
 We felt that they were joking
 isaki dadhi-moonch bhi nahin ai
 i remember that Jadeja and Mongia were in the Under-19 team before that tour
 ve baat kar rahe the sachin ke bare main
 But when we saw Sachin, i thought, where did he get this child from? 'vakaar ne aage kaha, 'usne neet clin cricket kheli
 His name did not figure in the controversy
 jentalman game khelaa he
 See how he meets juniors
 24 saal khele hai, lagbhag dhai dashak
 He has seen four generations of cricket
 kuch jo saamne ritair hue
 Some that started in front

 Everyone responds in the dressing room
 mujhe nahin lagata ki ab koi or aisa khel paaegaa
 Rameez Raja, former captain of the Rameez Rajapakistani cricket team, told, "there is a lot of hope on Sachin
 pressure bhi hota he
 He is the greatest role model
 mujhe nahin pataa ki aise topic par kya hum
 But to be fair, there are many rules imposed on bowling these days, which were not there before
 bowler free the apni marji se gend karne ke liye
 He said that Sachin has played dangerous bowlers
 khel badla he 24 saalon main
 Sachin never appeared out of touch in any kind of format
 ve apane khel kaa lutf dete hai
 Bradman had 6 great bowlers at the time
 sachin ne to bahut se mahaan gendbaajon ko khelaa
 His average is more than 56
 bahut badi baat he
 When Rameez was asked what it would be like to score 100 centuries, he said, 'only love for the game can do it
 sachin jaise khilaadi ko salaam karnaa chahie
 He stayed in the changing environment, the changing game and continued to run

 jab bhi ham mushkil hote the, sachin hameshaa salaah dete the
 Sachin used to stand far away in the field so that he could analyze the entire game
 sachin kii salaah par jab ham koi faisla lete the, safal rahata tha
 It was great to play with Sachin
 'ajahar ne bataaya, 'sachin ko bowling karnaa bhi pasand rahaa he
 It is a matter of the Hero Cup
 south africa ke khilaaf ek baar ek over baaki tha, africa ko 6 ran chahie the
 We thought that a different bowler should be given the over
 sachin ko diya to sachin ne hamen vah match jitwa diya
 was amazing
 'sachin ke pehle shatak ko yaad karte hue ajahar ne kaha, 'sachin kaa pehla shatak behtareen tha
 When he could not score a century in New Zealand, he was repressed

 He always wants to win, wants to be number one
 vah bowling, filding or batting sabamein awwal rahanaa chahta he

e
 Bahadur Shah Zafar
 kaha jaataa he ki bahadur shah jafar ko nammajna badshaah kii oopaadhi di gai thi
 After the death of his father Akbar Shah II in September 1837, he became the throne
 akbar shah dwitiya kavi hriday jafar ko sadiyon se chalaa aa rahaa mughalon kaa shashan nahin saunpna chaahate the

 The rebellious soldiers and king-emperors, stung by the British invasion, needed a central leadership, which showed them in Bahadur Shah Zafar
 bahadur shah jafar ne bhi britishon ke khilaaf ladaai main netritv sweekaar kar liya
 But 82-year-old Shah Zafar eventually lost the battle and had to spend the last year of his life in British captivity
 aalaa darje ke shaayar the bahadur shah jafaratbiyat se kavi hriday bahadur shah jafar shero-shaayari ke mureed the or unke darbar ke do sheersh shaayar mohammad gaalib or jock aaj bhi shaayaron ke liye adarsh hai
 Zafar himself was an excellent poet
 dard main duube unke sheron main maanav jivan kii gahari sachchaaiyaan or bhaawanaaon kii duniya basati thi
 While in captivity of the British in Rangoon, he wrote a lot of ghazals
 bataur kaidi unhen kalam tak nahin di gai thi, lekin sufi sant kii oopaadhi vaale badshaah jafar ne jali hui tiliyon se diwaar par gajalen likhin
 The British buried Zafar silently without any recollection
 Bahadur Shah Zafar died on the morning of November 7, 1862, in British captivity in Burma
 unhen usee din jail ke paas hi shwadagon pagoda ke najadik dafna diya gaya
 Not only this, a bamboo fence was erected around his grave and the grave was covered with leaves
 british chaar dashak se hindustan par raaj karne vaale mughalon ke aakhri badshaah ke antim sanskaar ko zyada taam-jhaam nahin dena chaahate the
 Anyway, for the Muslims of Burma it was not a death of a king but a common death
 us samay jafar ke antim sanskaar kii dekharekh kar rahe british adhikari davis ne bhi likhaa he ki jafar ko dafnaate vakt koi 100 log vahaan maujuud the or yah waisi hi bheed thi, jaise ghuddaud dekhne vaali yaa sadar bazaar ghoomane vaali
 An underground tomb was unearthed during an excavation to lay the foundation stone of a memorial hall in 1991, 132 years after Zafar's death

 At a depth of 5 feet, the emblem and remains of Emperor Zafar were found, which, after investigation, confirmed that it was from Zafar

 Bahadur Shah Zafar was the nominal emperor sitting on the throne of Delhi under British rule

 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi 15 june, 2004 ko police muthbhed main maare gaye aatankwaadiyon ke nishane par the
 This is revealed by the letter of Intelligence Bureau ie IB
 is khat main khud ibi ne mana ki is babat usne baqayada gujarat police ko jaankaree di thi godhra dangon ke baad narendra modi samet laal krishna adwani or praveen togadiya pakistan ke aatankiyon ke nishane par hai
 Exclusive report till date has now removed the curtain from the entire case
 aatank kii khaufnak sajeesh beparda hoti he ibi chif kii us chitthee se bhi, jo unhone28 farvari, 2013 ko sibiai nideshak ke naam likhi he
 It is clearly written in this letter
 
 
 godhra dangon ke baad se ibi ko ye jaankariyaan mil rahi hai ki narendra modi samet kai hinduvadi or dharmik netaaon kii jaan ko khatra he
 According to a specific information, lashkar-e-taiba is asking its people active in India to gather information about the movement of Lal Krishna Advani, Narendra Modi and VHP leader Pravin Togadia
 ibi ne is jaankaree ko 22 april, 2004 ko sabhi rajyon ke police pramukhon ko bheja
 Acting on this information, the IB also asked all its units to monitor the movements of the terrorists
 ibi ke ahmedabad ke joint diarector rajendra kumaar ne tatkaaleen police kamishnar keaar kowshik se milakar baqayada ye jaankaree bhi di ki pakistan ke punjab praant ke do aatankwaadi alag-alag makasad se gujarat main sakriy hai
 a Hindustani from Pune area of maharashtra is helping these two terrorists here
 matlab, ibi ke khat se saaf he ki khufia vibhaag ne narendra modi ko maarane kii manshaa se gujarat main gum rahe do pakistaniyon ko lekar gujarat police ko jaankaree di thi
 It has been further stated in this letter of the IB that the media got information about the four terrorists killed, including Ishrat Jahan
 isi khat main kaha gaya he ki maare gaye chaar main se do aatankwaadi jis urfiyat kaa istemaal kar rahe the, wo usase miltaa-julata he jaisaa ki ahmedabad ke joint diarector ne police kamishnar ko milakar jaankaree di thi
 David Headley, who was arrested by the FBI, also said in his statement that Lashkar commander Muzammil had told him that Ishrat Jahan was a lashkar-e-taiba suicide terrorist, who himself was involved in Lashkar
 itnaa hi nahin kashmir main pakade gaye pakistani aatankwaadi shahid mahmud basra ne bi bataaya tha ki ahmedabad main maare gaye aatankiyon me se ek pakistani fidaayin he
 Muzammil sent for action against vips
 ishrat jahaan samet chaaron aatakwaadi farji muthbhed main maare gaye yaa nahin, is baat kaa faisla adaalat karegi, lekin ek baat saaf he ki ishrat aatankwaadi thi auki uskaa rishta laskar-e- taiyaba ke commander ke saath hi un donon pakistaniyon se bhi tha, jinako hindustan main netaaon auki viipi logon ko maarane kii manshaa se laskar ne bheja tha
 Who were the targets of terrorists 
 
 target number 1- bal thakaretarget number 2- laal krishna advanitarget number 3- ashok singhlatarget number 4- praveen togadiyajis vakt aatankiyon ne ye sajeesh rachi thi, baaki ke chaar log gujarat se baahar the, isliye aatankiyon ne narendra modi ke liye rachi thi puri sajeesh
 Know what is the whole story 
 
 15 june, 2004 ko gujarat police ne ahmedabad shahar main tadake chaar aatankwaadiyon ko maar giraaya
 When media persons reached there, it was found that one of the slain terrorists was Ishrat Jahan, a girl living in Mumbra area of mumbai
 ye pehla aisa maamla tha jab pakistani aatankwaadiyon ke saath kisi mahila ko police ne maar giraaya tha
 Among the remaining slain terrorists were two Lashkar terrorists Amjad Ali Rana and Zeeshan Johar, while the third terrorist was Javed Sheikh who hailed from Kerala
 javed kii jimmedaari in pakistani aatankiyon ko local str par madad karne kii thi or police ke mutabik usne ishrat se nikaah bhi kar liya tha
 However, politics started at the same time regarding Ishrat's death
 mumbai main logon ne pradarshan bhi kiya, lekin ishrat auki javed ke parivaar ko chhodkar kisi bhi sarkari tantra ne is baat ko nahin mana ki ye ancounter farji tha
 However, there was a Congress-led UPA government at the center and a BJP government in Gujarat

 Tawang's report also said that the Gujarat Police picked up Ishrat and three of his associates from Mumbai on June 12 and killed him in custody on June 14
 report main ye bhi kaha gaya ki ishrat jahaan kaa na to kisi aatankwaadi gut se rishta tha auki na hi in logon se narendra modi ko jaan kaa khatra tha
 Additional DG PP Pandey, DIG DG Vanzara and the then Ahmedabad Police Commissioner Kaushik were also named in the report
 ise farji muthbhed maanate hue sunwaayee ke aadesh de die gaye
 On September 9, 2009, the Gujarat High Court imposed a stay on this report and asked the senior police officers of Gujarat to investigate the SIT case
 is esaiti ne apni report main magistrate tawang kii report par sawaal uthaate hue use khaarij kar diya
 Meanwhile, the High Court, while hearing the petition of Ishrat Jahan's mother Shamima Bano, ordered the formation of another SIT, which included the addition of a senior police officer from outside Gujarat and the preferred officer of the petitioner
 mjedaar baat ye ki is esaiti main shaamil kareeb teen varisht police adhikari jaanch bich main hi chhodkar chale gaye, kyonki maamla kaaphi pechida tha or saath hi esaiti ke ek sadsy aiji satish verma ke kaam karne ke tareekon se aapasi matbhed bhi hote rahe
 Barely SIT submitted its report to the High Court on November 21, 2011, stating that Ishrat and her accomplices were killed in a fake encounter
 haalanki esaiti kii report main is baat kaa zikr nahin kiya gaya ki maare gaye log aatankwaadi the yaa phir nahin
 Since the case was related to several states, the High Court handed over the investigation to the CBI in January 2012
 lekin is maamle main itane din biit jane ke baad bhi sibiai ne abhi tak chargeshit daakhil nahin kii he

 jiske baad sakht karrwai karte hue sarkaar ne aath karmchaariyon ko naukari se barkhaast kar diya he
 In fact, for the past several years, DTC employees have been continuously protesting against their demands
 jisamen samaan vetan or pakkaa karne kii maang pramukh he
 Kejriwal's promise reminded: DTC employees in their protest reminded Arvind Kejriwal at the time of election
 pradarshnakariyon ne kaha ki mukhyamantri ne chunaav se pehle ye vaada kiya tha ki DTC karmchaariyon ko pakkaa kiya janaa chahie or unhen samaan vetan diya janaa chahie
 But after coming to the government, Arvind Kejriwal has forgotten his promise
 karmchaariyon ne chetaya he ki agar dharne ke prabhaav ke baad bhi unki maangen puri nahin huin to ve 29 oktober ko phir hadtaal karenge
 Before the government banned social media, the DTC employees used social media to protest
 unhone fesabook or twitor par mantriyon ko tag karke sawaal poochne shuru kar die
 After that, the DTC department removed the circular and instructed its employees to stay away from social media and also warned to be dismissed if they did not agree

 9 percent of the people intend to vote for the Congress
 yah daawa ek taaja chunavi survey main kiya gaya he
 According to the survey, despite Kiran Bedi's arrival, Arvind Kejriwal has become the first choice of Chief Minister and BJP is getting more votes in the name of Narendra Modi than Kiran Bedi
 survey ke mutabik musalmaan, dalit, adivasee, pichhadi jatiyon or kam aay vaale logon ke bich aam aadmi party kii dhooma he
 With the election approaching, its popularity among voters is increasing

 Whereas bjp's vote share has come down from 45 to 41% survey ke mutabik sabhi umr ke logon ke bich aam aadmi party ko samarthan he, lekin 18-23 saal ke umr ke votaron main AAP sabase zyada lokapriy he
 53 percent of voters of this age are in favor of AAP
 survey ke mutabik, kiran bedi ko siem ummidavaar pesh karne se bijepi ko koi phayda nahin hota dikh rahaa he
 35 percent say that they will vote for BJP in any case, 47 percent say that they will not vote for BJP
 15 fisadi kaa faisla abhi spasht nahin he, ve bijepi ko vot de bhi sakate hai or nahin bhi
 Relief for the BJP is that this party has the highest number of committed voters
 bijepi ko vot kaa mood rakhane waalon main 84 fisadi kaa kahana he ki wo har haal main bijepi ko vot denge, jabaki aam aadmi party ko vot dene kaa man bana chuke 80 fisadi votaron kaa kahana he ki wo bijepi ko vot nahin denge

 After the threats of Karni Sena, people associated with the film are also avoiding to comment on it
 is bich prodeusar ashok shekhar ne rani padmini par 'main hum padmavati' movie banane kaa elaan kar diya he
 According to reports, a writer hailing from Rajasthan has written the film's story
 film main hum padmavati ko banane vaale mekars ne saaf kar diya he ki ham movie banane ke dauraan is baat kaa dhyaan rakhenge ki kisi kii bhavanaaen aahat nahin hon

 For this, he had also finalized the star cast, although that could not happen then

 In fact, Bhansali had the story of bajirao-mastani and 'padmavati' in mind since he made 'hum Dil De Chuke Sanam' in 1999 with Salman Khan, Ajay Devgan and Aishwarya Rai

 The former chief minister was reacting to the dismissal of the state's finance minister Haseeb Drabu in a shocking manner
 drabu ko sattadharipiples democratic partiki ore se centre ke saath baatcheet karne vaale pramukh vyakti ke taur par bhi janaa jaataa tha
 The reason for his removal was being cited as a controversial statement he made to some diplomats in New Delhi, in which he demanded an emphasis on the 'social' aspects of the Kashmir problem more than the 'political' aspects

 lekin isaki asli vajah kuch or he jo party jaahir nahin karnaa chaahegi
 Some experts say that the move by Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti Saeed is aimed at saving the party's rapidly declining credentials in the valley and giving a strong message to the alliance partner BJP
 pichley saal aktubar main intelligence beuro ke purv pramukh dineshwar sharma kii madhyasth ke rup main niyukti ko chhodkar pidipi-bhaajapa gathbandhan ne agenda of elliance (eoe) main kiye gaye vaadon ko puraa karne kii disha main shaayad hi koi kaam kiya he
 The draft of this agenda was jointly prepared by Drabu and BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav in 2014
 gathbandhan ke mukhya binduon—shashan main jaruri sudhaaron se lekar enechapisi kii dulahasti or udi bijli pariyojna kii rajya ko vaapasi tak ''sabhi andruni or bahari pakshon ke saath baatcheet'' par koi bhi kaam nahin hua he
 Chief Minister Mehbooba has appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi several times to re-negotiate with Pakistan and the Hurriyat
 mukhyamantri ke in anurodhon par bilkul bhi gaur nahin kiya gaya he or uski lagaataar avhelnaa kii gai he
 Following the same stance that Modi gave in November 2015 to the late leader Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, Madhav said in February this year that it was the Centre's prerogative what the time would be for talks with Pakistan
 unka kahana tha, ''mahaboobaaji kii apni raay ho sakati he, kyonki unhen lagata he ki do sarkarein agar ek-duusare se baatcheet karti hai to hinsa main kami aa sakati he
 But (on this subject) the coalition cannot form an opinion, its powers are limited in the affairs of the state
 '' pidipi ke aam kaaryakarta lambey samay se bhaajapa ke saath gathbandhan karne ke faisle par sawaal uthaate rahe hai
 a close minister of the Mufti family and a senior PDP minister says, "the alliance has lost the credibility of the party
" '' pidipi ke adhikansh netaa sweekaar karte hai ki gathbandhan ne khaskar dakshin kashmir ke party ke garh main matadaataaon ko vimukh kar diya he
 a large number of these disgruntled voters are youngsters who voted for the party in the 2014 Assembly election campaign because of its 'soft stance towards separatists and a stance against the BJP'
 pidipi ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ''drabu ko barkhaast karke mahabuuba ne us vyakti ko hi baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya he jisane pidipi or bhaajapa ke gathbandhan kii sharton kaa masauda taiyaar kiya tha
 Although the coalition is still intact, Mehbooba — to both the BJP and her voters — is indicating that she can break away from the alliance if needed
 ''mahabuuba kii ore se drabu kii jagah laae gaye nae vitt mantri saiyad altaaf bukhari ne srinagar main kaha, ''hamaari party kii vichaardhaara ko lekar kisi tarah kaa samjhauta nahin kiya jayega or agar sthiti bigadi to ham gathbandhan todgaye main jaraa bhi nahin hichakenge
 "this is not the first case to indicate his separation from the BJP
" is maheene ke shuru main mahabuuba ne apni cabinet main bhaajapa ke mantriyon kii us maang ko thukraa diya tha jisamen janvari ke maheene main kathua (jammu) main aath saal kii ek musalmaan ladki ke saath balaatkaar or hatya kii jaanch sibiai ko saunpane kii baat kahi gai thi
 The case caught a huge political color as it was seen as a result of the outrage of right-wing Hindus who are angry over the arrival of Muslim migrants in the Jammu region
 is maamle ko lekar bhaajapa ke kuch mantriyon ne sadakon par juluus nikaalkar maamle ko sibiai ke hawaale karne kii maang kii he
 But the Chief Minister is adamant that the state police will investigate the matter fully
 vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki ab keval kuch samay kii baat rah gai he
 Mehbooba can break the alliance with BJP anytime

 ' bihar kii satta main saajhedaar rashtriya janata dal ke pramukh lalu yadav kaa puraa parivaar nai musiibat main ghirta dikh rahaa he
 Lalu Yadav is accused that he made big financial mess while being the railway minister
 is maamle main argedy supremeo ke alaava unki patni rabari devi, bihar ke up mukhyamantri or unke bete tejasvi yadav ke alaava chaar anya logon kaa naam aayaa he
 CBI on Thursday registered a new case of corruption in this case and raided 12 places in Patna, Ranchi, Gurugram and Bhubaneswar, including the residence of Rabri Devi on Circular Road in Patna
 CBI ne kholaa lalu ke 'bhrashtachar' kaa kaccha chitthis maamle kii shuruaati sibiai jaanch main kai gambhir gadabadiyaan saamne ai
 According to the cbi's FIR, the roots of the case go back to the then NDA government's decision in 2001 when it decided to hand over the catering services of railway hotels to IRCTC
 railway board ne 2001 main faisla liya ki cataring sarvice or ranchi tathaa puri sthit railway ke hotel bnar kaa sanchaalan bhartiya railway se lekar iarsitisi ko de diya jayega
 Shortly thereafter, when Lalu became Railway Minister in 2004, he allegedly conspired with Malik Harsh and Vinay Kochhar of Sujata Hotels, Sarla Gupta, wife of PC Gupta, close to Lalu Yadav, and IRCTC officials
 in logon ne sajeesh ke tahat hotalon par adhikaar paane ke liye puri yojana banaai or ek saath hi kai kaam hue
 According to the CBI, Vinay Kochhar gave a three-acre prime land in Patna on February 25, 2005, according to the CBI, for just one and a half crore rupees
 47 karod rupee main dilite marketing ko bech di, jo ki cirkil rate se kaaphi kam thi
 The FIR states that the company was owned by Sarla Gupta, wife of Premchand Gupta, but in reality it was Lalu Yadav's benami company
 IRCTC ke tender main bhi hui gadabadisibiai kaa aarope he ki is saude ke din hi railway board ne bnar hotel iarsitisi ko saunpane kaa elaan kiya or phir donon hotalon kaa prabandhan kochar bandhuon kii company ko saunp diya gaya
 The tender which was withdrawn for this was also wrong and there was a conspiracy
 sibiai ke mutabik, is maamle main iarsitisi ke tatkaaleen prabandh nideshak pike goyal ne bhi kathith rup se dhaandhlee kii thi
 The Central Investigation Agency alleges that the terms of the tender were altered to make Sujata Hotel the sole claimant for the tender
 yahaan donon hotalon ke liye 15 se zyada tender dastavej hasil kiye gaye, lekin sujatha hotel ke alaava kisi duusari company kaa koi record nahin he
 According to the CBI, Lalun kept watch over the tender process as railway minister
 sibiai ne daawa kiya ki saal 2010 or 2014 ke bich dilite marketing kaa malikana haq bhi sarala gupta se lara projects ke haathon main chalaa gaya, jiskaa swaamitv rabari devi or tejasvi yadav ke paas he
 The FIR states that Lalu was not the railway minister at the time of the deal
 vahiin patna kii us jameen kii keemat bhi tab tak cirkil rate ke anusaar badhkar 32
 5 crores
 sibiai kaa aarope he ki pisi gupta ke parivaar ke sadasyon ne 32
 The share of the company worth Rs 5 crore net worth was transferred to Lalu Prasad Yadav's family at a nominal price of only Rs 65 lakh
 aropiyon ke khilaaf lagi hai ye dharencibiai ne is maamle main lalu prasad yadav, rabari devi, tejasvi prasad yadav, sarala gupta, vijay kochar, vinay kochar, lara projects or iarsitisi ke purv mahanideshak pike goyal ke khilaaf ipisi kii dhara 420 (dhokhadhadi), 120bi (saajha sajeesh yani kaaman kansperesi) ke alaava bhrashtachar nivaaran adhinium, 1988 (pisi act) kii dhaaraon 13(2) or 13(1) (di) ke tahat exiaar darj kiya he
 The next day after meeting Congress President Rahul Gandhi, on Wednesday, Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar wrote a letter and attacked him

 rajasthan sarkaar ne kisaanon kii madad ke liye vishwa bank se 545 karod rupee liye, magar ye paise kisaanon tak pahunch nahin paae
 In 2008, the Rajasthan government had made a plan of 832 crore to give loans to farmers
 is yojana ke tahat sarkaar ne vishwa bank se karj ke liye qaraar kiya
 Due to the delay, law-world Bank also released Rs 545 crore out of 832 crore, but by 2016, the government has disbursed only 42 crore rupees to the farmers, while the government World Bank from the public earnings of Rs 48 crore against its interest
 Will fill rajasthan sarkaar kaa kahana he ki deree kai tarah ke niyam or kaayade-kanoon kii vajah se hui
 The earnings of the public will go in interest and making announcements and forgetting has become a habit of governments, but when the government's habit falls on the people, what will they say? janata kii gadhi kamai ke 48 karod rupee rajasthan sarkaar world bank ko byaaj ke taur par degi kyonki kisaanon ke liye 542 karod rupye lekar kharch karnaa bhul gai
 In 2008, the Vasundhara government created the Rajasthan Agriculture Competitiveness Project and sent it to the World Bank through the central government for funding
 isamen krishi, bagwani, pashupaalan, sinchai or bhoojal jaise kai vibhaagon ko milakar kisaanon ko karj baantne kii yojana thi
 Meanwhile, the Vasundhara government went away and the Gehlot government of Congress came
 usne 2012 main yojana kii funding ke liye 832 karod kaa project world bank ko diya
 545 crores of which 1
 25 fisadi kii byaaj dar par rajasthan sarkaar ko de die gaye
 But by 2016, only 42 crore of this government could distribute to the farmers
 kisaanon ko aise muhaiyaa karana tha karj17 jilon main yantra, beej or khaad ke liye 14 lakh 39 hajaar rupephal, sabji, solar pump ke liye 3 lakh 13 hajaar rupejal sangrahan ke liye 7 lakh do hajaar rupepashupaalan ke liye 2 lakh 19 hajaar rupenhar sinchai nirmaan ke liye 2 lakh 36 hajaar rupayebhujal gatividhiyon ke liye 11 lakh 50 hajaar ruperajasthan sarkaar ke krishi mantri prabhulaal saini kaa kahana he ki deree isliye hui kyonki1
 The four departments were to share the debt together
 2
 The central government asked for a separate rule for spending rather than the Rajasthan Transparency Act
 3
 Under this scheme, farmers had to spend 25% of the amount earlier, which the farmers do not do
 4
 Due to change of government, the plan could not be implemented
 rajasthan main karj maafee nahin balki karj milanaa hi mushkil haiuttar pradesh me bhale hi yogi sarkaar ne kisaanon ko karj maafee kii saugat di ho lekin rajasthan main halaat ekadam juda hai
 The unseasonal rains and hailstorms in Rajasthan have already killed the farmers and now the continuous cut in the share of farmers has reduced the target of sharing the debt, which means farmers are going to suffer twice
 byajrahit lone main dilchaspee nahin dikhaa rahe kisanpichley salrajasthan sarkaar neye bataaya tha ki byaaj rahit lone se 26 hajaar kisaanon ko joda jayega, lekin is baar kisaanon ne isamen rujhaan nahin dikhaaya
 In fact, with the cooperation of NABARD, the government provides farmers with interest-free loans
 samay par lone chukaane par byaaj sabsidi milti he
 17 thousand crores were given to the farmers under the scheme in the state, but the situation is changing since 2014
 2015-16 main sarkaar ne 14 hajaar karod kaa lakshya rakhaa, lekin kisaanon ke dabaav ke chalate 15 hajaar karod kaa lone dena padaa tha
 In 2016-17, the target of 500 crore more than the previous one, but at the end of the year, a loan of only twelve and a half thousand crore was given
 karj vasuuli main bhi pichad rahi he rajasthan sarkarsarkaar lone baantne ke saath vasuuli main bhi pichad rahi he
 Last year, 70 percent recovery was done, but this year it has remained at 37 percent, which means that the farmer is not in a position to repay the loan
 sarkaar ne abhi tak samarthan mulya par kharid tak shuru nahin kii he
 Recovery is not possible without the purchase of the crop of the farmer
 sarkaar ne samay seemaa nahin badhaai to kisaan par byaaj kii bhi maar padegi kyonki samay seemaa ke baad byaaj kii chhot nahin milti

 bijepi ne upi chunaav main naa sirf swati singh ko chunaav ladane ke liye tikat diya balki sarkaar banane ke baad unhen mantri pad bhi diya gaya he
