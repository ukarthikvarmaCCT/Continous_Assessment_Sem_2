 Before the Congress headquarters was built, this bungalow was a close and loyal Rajya Sabha MP to Indira Gandhi

 The entire office complex is also divided into five parts
 indira se lekar sonia gandhi tak sabhi congress adhyakshon ne congress mukhyalay main badlaav kiye
 Sometimes rooms were enlarged and sometimes restrooms

 If the government wants to pay more than this, then meet it with our own resources
 'gatirodh bana rahaa to badhenge chini ke damaupi main kul 101 privet hai or 23 sahakaari chini milen hai
 Last year there was a total sugarcane payment of Rs 23 thousand crore, in which the sugar mills still owed Rs 2300 crore

 But i think this is a pressure strategy
 yaa to ye let shuru karnaa chaahate he yaa dabaav main lekar centre or upi sarkaar se aarthik madad chaahate hai
 There is no reason not to run the mill

 It is only late for the farmers to come on the roads

 In order to compensate the losses incurred on sale of diesel to government oil companies, its prices will be increased by 40 to 50 paise per liter every month
 desh main petroleum utpaadon main sabase zyada khapat dijal kii hi hoti he

 Under this decision, the public sector oil companies have been allowed to increase diesel prices a little till their losses are met
 philhal, dijal par unhen aayaat mulya ke hisaab se 10
 There is a loss of Rs 80 per liter
 tel companiyon ne 17 janvari ko prati litre dealer main 45 paise kii badhotaree kii thi
 Diesel price in Delhi at 47
 65 rupee prati litre ho gaya tha
 With this, the price increase for wholesale customers has increased to Rs 10 per liter
 moili ne bataaya ki dijal kii keemton main prati maah maamuli badhotaree karne kaa nirnay aglaa aadesh jari hone tak lagu rahegaa
 He, however, did not say when the oil companies would raise diesel prices again
 dijal kaa daam badhaane se is kadam se sarkaar dwaara di jane vaali sabsidi kii kareeb 12,907 karod rupee salanaa kii bachat hogi
 But some wholesale customers have decided to buy diesel from petrol pumps like retail customers

 Currently, these corporations buy fuel directly from oil companies for their personal use

 The comments moili ne kaha, hamen is masale par phir se vichaar karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 We have also heard this
 ham is par gaur kar rahe hai
 Instead of instructing the buses to fill diesel with petrol pumps, the state governments should reduce VAT and sales tax on diesel, so that it becomes cheaper

 We need international investment
 nivesh se rojgaar srujit hoga, nivesh se laabh arjeet kar sakenge
 We will be able to invest in social security when investment comes

 We will end the exemption gradually and we have proposed to increase the corporate tax to 25 percent
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki ham na keval antarrashtriya nivesh ke liye pratispardhaa kar rahe hai balki gharelu nivesh ke liye liye pratispardhaa kar rahe hai
 Indians are also preferring investment in other countries, as the tax structure is consistent in many countries

 It is time to celebrate for Pandari village located in Purulia district of West Bengal

 But the happiness doubled when the villagers got more than they thought

 The installation of decentralized solar power has benefited about 80 households in the village, which used to burn out the fire earlier

 ' Rahul Gandhi moving to America, communicating there is part of Team Rahul's future strategy
 rahul ke america main die bayaan or sawaalon ke jawaab ishaara kar rahe hai ki, unki raajnneeti bhavishya main kis disha main jane vaali he
 In his dialogues, Rahul hinted at both the party president's chair or the prime ministerial candidacy that he was ready
 yah sab kuch yun hi nahin hua, iske peeche modi virodh kii raajnneeti, nitish kaa alag hona or bhavishya ke lihaaj se rahul gandhi kaa taiyaar hona he
 Rahul will take charge of the Congress in October! Rahul made this communication when it is decided that after the elections the Congress Party organization will replace Sonia Gandhi
 mana ja rahaa he ki, oktober main congress kii kaman aadhikarik taur par rahul ke haathon main hogi
 Before this, Rahul wants to improve his image
 rahul nehru gandhi parivaar kii viraasat ko to sanbhaalanaa chaahate hai, lekin bojha nahin dhonaa chaahate
 That is why, Rahul gives his opinion on the Sikh riots during his father Rajiv Gandhi, describes himself with the victims and declares the incident wrong
 vahiin, aage badhate hue congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke kaarykaal par bhi sawaal khadaa karte hai
 When he says that, after 2012, the Congress has become arrogant, they separate themselves
 aakhir sabhi jaanate hai ki, 2012 ke baad hi upie sarkaar badnaam hui bhrashtachar ke tamaam aarope us par lage jiske chalate 2014 main party 44 par aa gai
 The exercise of becoming the undisputed leader of the opposition before the pm's candidature - In fact, Rahul's strategists are not just looking at the post of Congress president
 balki piem pad kii ummidavaari se pehle rahul ko sonia ke bajaae vipaksh ke netaa ke taur par sthapit karne kii he
 That is why Rahul also gave direct indications of his candidature for the post of Prime Minister
 iske liye bhi rahul ke ranneetikaron ne puri taiyaari kar rakhi he
 He knows that the Congress is the largest party of the opposition and besides being the leader of the party, he has to be accepted as the leader of the opposition among the other opposition parties
 nitish ke rahete asamanjas main the rahul, ab khulkar aae maidan main-yah baat kisi se chuphi nahin he ki, nitish ke rahete rahul lagaataar asamanjas main the
 According to Rahul's close acquaintances, Rahul was willing to put himself behind in the name of Nitish becoming the pm's candidate, but Nitish parted, changing the heads of the other regional parties and in return Rahul was confronted with a new strategy
 Was forced to come
 badale halaat main rahul ko vipaksh kii mukhya aawaaj banane kii koshish ke peeche kii kahani-aakhir team rahul maanati he ki, siyaasi halaat deshbhar main badale hai
 Now that Nitish is with Modi, in all the states too, the leadership of regional parties is now on the new generation, with whom Rahul is constantly making contact and that generation will not be avoiding Rahul as a leader
 rahul ke kareebi rajyavar isaki charchaa bhi karte hai
 State-wise chemistry of Congress, Rahul and regional leaders-tamil Nadu, because of the age and health of DMK leader Karunanidhi in this state is now in the hands of his son Stalin
 sutron kii maane to is stallin or rahul lagaataar aapas main kai maukon par mil bhi chuke hai or bhavishya kii raajnneeti kii charchaa bhi kar chuke hai
 The division is straightforward - the Congress younger brother in Tamil Nadu and the DMK younger brother in Delhi
 biharnithish ke saath chhodane ke baad ab congress or lalu ke bich gathbandhan swaabhaavik he or donon kii majaburi he
 Lalu gets out of the electoral battle due to Rahul's move to tear his ordinance
 ab lalu bhi apane beton ke liye raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 At the same time, Rahul is not avoiding sons
 rahul ke chalate lalu chunaav lard nahin sakate
 In such a situation, RJD will stand behind Rahul in the name of Modi opposition, while in Bihar, Congress is following RJD
 yah mahaj sanyog nahin he ki, rahul ke samvaad ke thik 1 din pehle argedy supremeo lalu yadav ne twit kiya- desh kii sarkaar shantipurna tareeke se sirf congress hi chalaa sakati he or log ye ehsaas karne lage hai
 At the same time, Sharad Yadav had pledged to protest against Modi and Nitish only after meeting Rahul
 isliye sharad yadav ko bhi rahul ke saath aane main dikkat nahin he
 The situation here is the same here
 jharkhand mukti morcha ke netaa shibu sorain aap party kii kaman apane bete hemanth sorain ko saunp chuke hai or hemanth ko bhi centre kii raajnneeti main rahul kii saraparasti se koi etraj nahin
 Similar is the case with Babulal Marandi, the head of the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha, when he becomes part of the opposition alliance when the time comes, he has no objection to standing behind Rahul
 andhra pradeshbantwaare ke baad rajya main congress haashie par padi he
 Constant Congress strategists are trying to make Jaganmohan Reddy, once a Congressman, return to the Congress or tie up with the Congress
 congress ko ummid he ki agar baat bani to rajya main jagan or dilli main rahul kii baat par donon ek saath ho jaaenge
 Bengal CPM leaders Sitaram Yechury and Rahul Gandhi have come very close to each other in recent times
 modi virodh kii surat main yechuri ko rahul ke saath khadaa hone main koi pareshaani nahin he
 At the same time, Congress strategists say that even during demonetisation, Rahul and Congress convened Mamta Banerjee to accept the press conference
 isiilie bhavishya main bhi isamen dikkat nahin hogi
 However, the Congress has a big problem in the state, to manage each other's rival CPI (M) and Trinamool Congress together
 uttar pradeshyaha samaajawaadee party ab mulaayam kii nahin akhilesh kii ho chuki he
 Also, the friendship and shared politics of Akhilesh Rahul is not hidden from anyone
 congressi ranneetikaron kaa kahana he ki, vartmaan raajnneetik halaat main apane astitv kii ladaai ke liye siton kaa samjhauta or bhavishya ke liye sahi prastaav milane par gaahe-bagaahe mayawati bhi is paale main aa hi jaaengi
 The events of NCP joining NDA in Maharashtra recently has made the Congress restless
 lekin ranneetikaar maanate hai ki, agar modi virodh or secularism kii raajnneeti main sharad pavaar kii ensipi ne vipaksh kaa saath dena pasand kiya to sharad pavaar kii sehat or umr ke chalate rashtriya raajnneeti main unki beti supriya sule or rajya main unke bhattije ajit pavaar uttaradhikari honge
 In such a situation, Supriya will not mind Rahul's patronage and Sharad Pawar can discuss Sonia Gandhi anytime if needed
 kul milakar ab team rahul tay kar chuki he ki, modi se takaraana hoga to pehle congress kii kaman sanbhaalani hogi, phir vipakshi dalon ko saath laakar netritv karnaa hoga or 2019 main pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar bananaa hoga
 Taking a step in this direction, Rahul said that if he wants to become the party president, then in 2019, he also announced to be the candidate for the Prime Minister's chair
 in donon ke bich kaa safar team rahul aahista-aahista puraa karnaa chaahati he
 That is the journey, Rahul becoming the accepted leader of the opposition instead of Sonia Gandhi himself
 ranneeti ko zamin par utaarna rahul kii chunauti-baat sidhi he ki rahul congress party ke adhyaksh ban jaaenge isamen koi chunauti nahin he
 There will be no challenge in this, as the Congress Party will be declared the Prime Ministerial candidate for 2019
 darasal asli chunauti to vipaksh kaa netaa banane kii he,jisko sabhi vipakshi dal maan len
 Because Team Rahul also knows that, in today's era, the Congress is not alone enough to confront Modi and BJP, the opposition will have to unite
 isiilie ab tak asamanjas main dikh rahe rahul ne khulkar bhavishya siyasat kaa elaan kar diya he
 Rahul and his team need to remember that it is easy to strategize, difficult to land on the ground
 saath hi vipaksh ke netaaon kaa saath bhale rahul juta len, lekin asli chunauti to janata kaa saath paane kii hogi
 Maharashtra BJP leader Pankaja Munde was absent during the party's regional meeting in Aurangabad on Monday
 bataaya jaataa he ki 21 oktober ko hue vidhansabha chunaavon main haar ke baad se hi vah naaraaz chal rahi hai
 State BJP president Chandrakant Patil said she was not feeling well, due to which she remained absent with prior permission
 patil ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘‘baithak ke liye aurangabad aane se pehle maine pankaja munde se baat kii thi

 unhone apane twitor handle se ‘‘bijepi'' shabd bhi hataa diya jisase bijepi main unke bhavishya ko lekar kayaas lagaae jane lage the
 However, Pankaja later clarified that she is not leaving the BJP and changing parties is not in her blood
 anna hajaare ne krishi mantri sharad pavaar ko thappad maare jane kii ghatana ke baad di gai apni pratikriya ko sahi tehraate hue kaha he ki na hi vah gandhi hai or na hi pavaar ko padaa thappad hinsa tha
 Anna has said in her latest blog that it is not right to compare him to Mahatma Gandhi, because he is not able to sit with Mahatma Gandhi either
 unhone kaha ki vah gandhi ji ko adarsh jarur maanate hai, lekin kabhi−kabhi shivaji kaa adarsh bhi saamne rakhte hai
 Taking a dig at Pawar, Anna said that Pawar has a very old habit of saving corrupt people
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki pavaar ke samarthakon ne unhen gandi gaaliyaan deen, jo unhone record karke rakhaa he or ab vah unhen bajaakar janata ko sunaayenge
 Meanwhile, Anna will leave for Delhi on 10 December and intends to give a one-day sit-in at Jantar Mantar on 11 December
 peeth main dard kii vajah se doctoron ne unhen aaraam karne kii salaah di he, lekin anna is salaah ko nazarandaaj karte hue dilli jaaenge
 In his support, the people of Ralegan Siddhi have also decided to go on a day-long fast
 anna hajaare jantar−mantar par sabhi dalon ke netaaon ko lokapal par khuli bahes main bulaanaa chaahate hai, lekin kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ne ab tak khulkar is par apni raay jaahir nahin kii he

 Team India captain Virat Kohli loves the challenge and that is why he is looking forward to playing in the ICC Champions Trophy like the quarter-final against South Africa tomorrow
 kohli se jab poocha gaya ki kya yah unki captaini kariyar kii sabase badi pariksha he, to unhone muskaraate hue jawaab diya, kya pakistan ke khilaaf pehla match sabase bada nahin tha

 bihar ke upmukhyamantri susheel modi ne kaha ki jab tak centre main narendra modi kii or bihar main nitish kumaar va bijepi kii sarkaar he, essi-asti ke saath kabhi anyaay nahin hoga

 Modi raised several questions accusing the RJD, who ruled Bihar for 15 years, of shedding crocodile tears on the issue of Dalits

 aaj yani mangalvaar ko devshayni ekadshi he
 According to mythology, for four months from now, Shrihir Vishnu goes to sleep in the Hades
 phir chaar maheene baad yani karthik shukla paksh kii ekadshi ko uthte hai
 Srihari
 
 
 
 Therefore no auspicious work can be done for four months
 devshayni ekadshi kaa mahatvaasadha maah ke shukla paksh kii ekadshi ko 'devshayni ekadshi' kehete hai
 From this Ekadashi, Srihari Vishnu goes to Yoganidra for the next four months
 isliye agle chaar maah tak koi bhi shubh karne kii manaahi hoti he
 Chaturmas also starts with Devshayani Ekadashi
 is ekadshi se tapasviyon kaa bhraman bhi band ho jaataa he, in dinon keval braj kii yatra kii ja sakati he
 After four months, Shrihari's grace will not be available for four months from today, and without Srihari's grace and his grace, no auspicious act can be successful
 isliye jab tak srihari yoga nidra main hai tab tak koi bhi shubh kaam karne se bachanaa chahie
 But in Devshayani Ekadashi Yoga Nindra, a boon can be sought from Srihari
 kya he srihari vishnu kii yoga nidra kaa rahasyapuranon ke anusaar ek baar raja bali ko apni shakti or dhan kaa ghamand ho gaya tha
 Then Shrihari Vishnu took the form of Vamana to break the boast of sacrifice
 shri hari ne vaaman rup main bali se teen pag daan ke rup main maange
 Already, Pag Srihari measured the entire earth and sky including all directions
 duusare pag main prabhu ne swarg ko naap liya
 Srihari measured the whole world in three steps
 Now, there is nothing left to keep the third step, then Bali put his head forward and requested that the Lord put his third step on my head
 bali ke is samarpan se prasann hokar bhagwaan vishnu ne bali ko pataal kaa raja bana diya or vardaan maangane ko kaha
 Bali said, Lord, stay in my palace forever
 ab bhagwaan vishnu bali ke bandhan main bandha chuke the
 In such a situation, Mata Lakshmi requested Bali to make her promiseless to make God free
 usee din se 4 maheene ke liye srihari vishnu pataal main nivas karte hai
 After this, Lord Shiva and Lord Brahma reside in the Hades of Bali till Mahashivratri, from Shivaratri to Devshayani Ekadashi
 kya sachmuch devshayni ekadshi ko so jate hai srihari?devshayni ekadshi ko lekar logon main kai tarah ke bhram or ashankaayen bhi hai
 So today, we are going to tell you the truth of Sri Nihari's yoga sleep
 kya sachmuch devshayni ekadshi ko so jate hai srihari
 Hari and Dev also mean sharp elements
 is samay main surya, chandramaa or prakruti kaa tej kam hota jaataa he, isiilie kaha jaataa he ki dev shayan ho gaya he
 The results of the actions done due to weak elements or auspicious powers are not auspicious and there is a possibility of hindrance in auspicious actions
 isliye devshayni ekadshi se agle chaar maah tak shubh kaary karne kii manaahi hoti he
 Even if Shrihari Yoga goes into sleep on Devshayani Ekadashi, you can also get many blessings on this day by his grace
 devshayni ekadshi par milegaa vardaandevshayni ekadshi par samuhik paapon or samasyaon kaa se mukti mil sakati he
 The sum of accidents is averted and one's mind is purified
 is ekadshi ke baad se sharir or man main naepan kaa abhas hota he
 Today is such a divine day
 
 
 
 On this day, you can fulfill all your wishes with special worship of Srihari

 Chris Gayle also showed his mettle in bowling after scoring his first double century in the World Cup, which helped the West Indies beat Zimbabwe by a 73-run victory over Duckworth Lewis in the Pool b match
 kharaab form ke kaaran aalochakon ke nishane par rahe gail ne 147 gend par 215 ran banaaye jisamen das chauke or 16 chakke shaamil hai
 He shared a one-day international cricket record partnership for the second wicket with Malren Samuels (133 not out), helping the West Indies score a mammoth total of 372 for two, batting first
 zimbabwe ne haalanki jujharupan dikhaaya lekin bade lakshya ke dabaav main uski team 44
 He was dismissed for 289 in 3 overs
 zimbabwe kii pari ke shuru main hi barish aa gai jiske kaaran bich main khel rokna padaa
 Later two overs were reduced and a target of 363 runs in 48 overs was set for Zimbabwe
 zimbabwe ke liye seen williams (76) or craig ervin (52) ne ardhashatak jadkar westeindies ko bich main chintaa main daalaa kyonki carabian team apane pehle match main ireland ke khilaaf 300 se adhik ke score kaa bachaav nahin kar pai thi
 Wicketkeeper batsman Brandon Taylor also played an impressive 37 runs before losing the wicket due to referral
 lekin aaj kaa din gail ke naam likhaa tha
 After making many new records in batting, bowling also showed amazing and took two wickets for 35 runs in six overs
 captain jaisan holder or jerome tailor ne bhi teen-teen wicket hasil kiye
 This is West Indies' second win in three matches while Zimbabwe's second defeat in as many matches
 gail ne yah pari tab kheli jabaki westeindies ne toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karte hue duusari gend par hi dwen smith (shunya) kaa wicket ganvaa diya tha
 Gayle was dismissed on the last ball of the innings
 unhone sampuls ke saath duusare wicket ke liye 372 ran kii saajhedaari karke vanade kaa nayaa record banaaya
 Earlier record was in the name of Tendulkar and Dravid who added 331 runs against New Zealand in 1999 in Hyderabad
 baayen haath ke is ballebaaj ne dhimi shuruuaat kii lekin aakhir main unke tufaani tewaron ke kaaran westeindies aakhri 13 overon main 195 ran banane main safal rahaa
 Of these 152 runs were scored in the last ten overs
 gail ne pehle 50 ran 51 gendon par puure kiye jabaki vah 105veen gend kaa saamana karke shatak tak pahunche
 This is his 22nd century in odis
 iske baad unhone keval 21 gend par aglaa pachaasa thoka or phir jald hi apana pichhlaa sarvocch score (naabad 153 ran) paar kiya
 Gayle played only 12 balls to reach 150 to 200 and completed his first double century off 138 balls
 vah duniya ke pehle aise ballebaaj ban gaye hai jinhone test main tihara, vanade main doharaa or tii20 main shatak jadaa ho
 Gayle scored 21 runs with the help of two fours and two sixes in one over from spinner Tafadjwa Kamungoji and then hit three sixes in the next over from Sean Williams to set a new record for the highest score in odis for the World Cup and West Indies
 tendai chataara kii gend chaar ran ke liye bhejkar gail ne apana doharaa shatak puraa kiya
 Prior to the West Indies, the record of highest score in odis was in the name of Viv Richards (189)
 duusare chor par sampuls shuru se ran banane ke liye jujhate rahe lekin baad main unhone gail se sabak lekar kuch achche shot lagaae
 Samuels had completed his half-century by facing 95 balls
 unhone apni naabad pari main kul 156 gend kheli tathaa 11 chauke or teen chakke lagaae
 He improved his strike rate by scoring 22 runs off Penyangra in the 49th over of the innings
 zimbabwe kii shuruuaat acchhee nahin rahi or ek samay uskaa score teen wicket par 46 ran tha
 Williams and Taylor then added 80 runs for the second wicket in just 12 overs
 williams ne baad main ervin ke saath bhi 51 ran kii saajhedaari kii lekin iske baad usne niyamit antaraal main wicket ganvaae
 Commonwealth Games Organizing Committee Chairman Suresh Kalmadi on Thursday denied that the government had imposed Qatar on him by constituting a committee of bureaucrats
 unhone kaha ki vah ab bhi baas hai or samiti unke aagrah par gathit kii gayi he
 Kalmadi reacted strongly that the formation of the committee meant a reduction in her rights
 unhone kaha, ‘samachar report main kaha gaya he ki das naukarshahon ko niyukt kiya gaya he lekin ye niyuktiyaan hamaare aagrah par kii gayi hai
 The organizing committee had urged Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that the final phase of the Games had begun and the government officials needed help
 ’kalmari ne kaha, ‘ve sahyog ke liye aa rahe hai
 They will help us
 har baar aap kehete ho ki kalmari ke par katar diye gayi hai
 Let me tell you that i was the first pilot
 ’ In order to curb corruption and black money, the central government has announced to stop the circulation of 500 and 1000 existing notes
 inaki jagah par ab 500 or 2000 ke nae note aaenge
 The old notes of 500 and 1000 will become illegal from midnight
 inhen bainkon yaa dakgharon main jamaa kiya ja saktaa he
 a deadline of 50 days has been set for this
 centre sarkaar ke is faisle ke doorgaami parinaam honge
 This decision will affect those who have kept their black money as cash
 kyonki 30 disambar 2016 ke baad in noton kii koi keemat nahin rah jaaegi
 With this decision, all the counterfeit notes running across the country became useless in one stroke
 isse chunaavon main hone vaali funding ko bhi tagada jhatka laga he or punjab or upi ke vidhansabha chunaavon main jarur iskaa asar padegaa
 See photo: Now the thousand-five hundred note of this work, however, this decision of the government has forced the hoarders of black money to invent new and unique ways to settle their black money
 31 march 2016 tak 16
 5 lakh crore black money was in the country
 is rakam kaa zyaadaatar hissaa karency noton ke taur par jamaakar rakhaa hua tha jo karpshan yaa 'keval cash tranjaction' ke jariye jamaa kii gai blike mani thi
 After the latest decision of the government, only those people who have earned money legally, will be able to muster the courage to deposit big notes in the banks till December 30, 2016
 jin logon ne avaidh tareeke se paise kamaaye hai unki haalat kharaab ho jaaegi kyonki dedline khatm hote hi ye note raddi ke bhav bikenge
 How will this decision affect those who have unfathomable black money? wo pehali koshish karenge ki in paison se sona kharid liya jaae
 By the time the deadline ends, the demand for gold and such instruments of investment will increase
 lekin uske baad kya hoga
 The government will curb the sale of gold across the country
 sarkaar ke taaja faisle se property kii keemten girengi
 Because most of the properties in the country are bought through cash which comes through consignment of black money
 ek anumaan ke mutabik property ke jude kaarobaar kaa kareeb aadha hissaa blike mani or benami tranjaction par aadhaarit he
 According to the Reserve Bank, 45 per cent of the currency notes in the country are Rs 500 while 39 per cent are Rs 1000
 is vakt kareeb 16 arab 500 rupee ke note or 6 arab 1000 rupee ke note cirkulation main hai
 In this way, the government has stopped 84 percent of the notes in one stroke
 isiilie deshbhar main bainkon or atm ko do dinon tak band rakhane kaa bhi elaan karnaa padaa
 To replace the old 500 and 1000 notes and replace them with 500 and 2000 new notes, the Reserve Bank may have to spend an additional Rs 10,000 crore
 5000 or 10 hajaar ke note jaisi badi karency laae jane kii bhi atakalein hai
 However, the government has put such proposals on the back burner in view of the possibility of black money deposits
 ek anumaan ke mutabik hamaare desh main blike mani hamaari jidipi kii ek-chauthai se lekar 2-3 guna tak ho sakati he
 In such a situation, it is a big decision of the government to curb black money
 lekin note band kiye jane kaa yah maamla duniya main pehla nahin he
 Earlier this year, the European Central Bank said that it was considering closing the 500 euro note
 america main bhi 100 dollar ke nae bill jari karne par roak lagi he
 2 in 2010
 6 arab dollar keemat ke ek dollar ke bill nasht kiye gaye the
 This was the biggest ever extinction of currency in the world
 dilli-ensiaar samet uttar bharat main aae bukampake jhatkon ke baad piemo india ne twit kiya ki piem modi ne taaja halaat kii jaankaree lee he or ek ucchstareey baithak bhi bulaai he
 Also, the Prime Minister has instructed all concerned authorities to be prepared for relief and rescue work

 Janata Dal United national president Nitish Kumar was aware that somewhere in the selection of the candidate there was a mistake from the party, so on Thursday when he came to Jokihat for campaigning, he said that the local people opinion and the selection of the candidate Discussions were held with the leaders of allies

 This time the contest is triangular but RJD seems to be confident of its victory on the basis that RJD got eighty thousand votes from Jokihat Assembly in the by-election for Araria Lok Sabha seat held two months ago
 yah antar kam ho saktaa he lekin haar main filhal nahin badal saktaa

 The cobra has the ability to swallow many snakes
 lekin kya ho jab uskaa saamana ajgar se ho jaae
 One such fight has been seen in Singapore
 ek shaks ne soshal media par donon kaa video share kiya he
 It is clear that a heavy cobra is slowly moving towards the dragon, but the dragon also gets ready for the attack as soon as the danger is heard
 cobra ko lagata he ki saamne vaala jeev koi chota-motaa jeev hoga or vah usne mauka dekhte hi ajgar kii poonch ke hisse main daant gada detaa he
 But the dragon also attacks in defense
 itane main cobra ko bhi lag jaataa he ki saamne vaale se bhidana khatre se khaali nahin he
 He is confronted by his collision snake
 maukey kii najaakat ko dekh cobra vahaan se bhaag khadaa hota he
 The cobra thinks that the creature in front will be a small creature and he bites the teeth in the tail of the dragon as soon as he sees the opportunity
 lekin ajgar bhi bachaav main hamalaa kar detaa he
 At this point, the cobra also feels that it is not empty of danger to confront the front
 uskaa saamana usee ke takkar vaale saanp se ho gaya he
 The cobra runs away from there, looking at the opportunity

 The crook cut his finger and took it with him
 lekin hairaani vaali baat ye he ki iske alaava badmaashon ne un gahanon ko haath bhi nahin lagaaya jinhen jyoti ne pahana hua tha
 Even the rogue Jyoti's expensive mobiles were left in her car
 mauka-e-vaardaat se police ko suraag ke naam par teen chaaku pade mili
 Whom Jyoti's murderers left there after being murdered
 police ko shuruaati jaanch main to koi kamyaabi nahin mili lekin ek baat to tay he ki kaatilon ne jis tareeke se vaardaat ko anjaam diya tha
 It is clear to him that his motive was not looting
 unhone jyoti ko jaan se maarane ke iraade se hi uski apharan kiya tha
 The police made some shocking revelations in the Jyoti murder case on Piyush Shyam Desani Paramangalwar, husband of Jyoti Sui
 shaq kii sui jyoti ke pati piyush shyaam desani par ja tiki he
 During the investigation, police took Piyush into custody and he was interrogated

 party main ek ke baad ek aarope, sting or apano kii berukhi kaa silsilaa chal padaa he
 After Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Rajesh Garg and Shahid Azad, now another 'AAP' leader Rakesh Parikh has accused the party's style of functioning, changing policy and being 'kejriwal-centric'
 paarikh ne apane blog par ek lekh ke jariye party ke rashtriya sanyojak arvind kejariwal se kai sawaal kiye hai
 What happened to 'arvind' you? ' In this article written by the title Dr
 rakesh paarikh ne kejariwal se sawaal kiya he ki kya party main ab sawaal poochne kaa adhikaar kisi ko nahin he? unhone shanti bhushan kaa zikr karte hue likhaa he ki kya 80 saal kii umr main party ke us saadhaaran sadsy ko apni raay rakhane kaa adhikaar nahin he? party main gutbaji par virodh prakat karte hue dow
 Parikh has written at the end of the letter that he wanted to put these things in the National Council, but he was not even given a chance to speak

 ye wo din the jab neend 16 ghante ke bajaay 70 ghante kaam karne ke baad aati
 And then that evening of August 2, when Annaji announced political options
 tivi par khabar dekhte hi patni kaa phone aayaa
 He said, 'come back immediately
 hamen bevakoof banaaya gaya he
 These people are playing politics by playing with our feelings in the name of movement
 ' yaad hoga aapako maine bataaya tha, usne mujhe talaak kii dhamkee tak de daali thi
 In the next meeting you asked, 'what do you say, sister-in-law?' Till now i kept explaining it, but what answer should i give today? Mission foundation was done in Jaipur
 kaarykram kaa aayojan kiya or sabhi ke aagrah ke baavjood main jaipur jila kaaryakarini se baahar rahaa
 i had considered my role till the basic infrastructure of a good political option is made in my district
 uske 2 mahino baad kaushambi karyaalay main hui wo mulaakaat bhi yaad bhi hogi, jab manish ji ne mujhase kaha tha, 'achche log apni jimmedaariyon se bhaagate hai or phir shikaayat karte hai kii raajnneeti gandi he
 You have to take responsibility, Dr
 Sir
 kuch dinon baad wo pradesh kaaryakarini banane jaipur aae
 Stayed at my house and then with the same sentimental arguments handed me the responsibility of Rajasthan Secretary
 kaushambi karyaalay main hui usee mulaakaat main maine kaha tha aap donon se 'aazaadee kii ladaai kaa sipaahi hum, gulaami apane senapati kii bhi nahin karuunga
 'you must have sensed my attitude that day
 yadi ji hujuri kerani hoti to itnaa sangharsh hi kyon karte? kya hamen aaj raajnneeti main apana bhavishya banane ko aae, ji hujuri karne vaale logon kii hi aavashyaktaa rah gai? sawaal poochne waalon kii nahin?aage padhein, jab 12 hajaar logon ke dastakhat lekar aae the paarikh
 
 
 Lok Sabha elections were held, Rajasthan also handled the responsibility of screening candidates
 22 pratyaashee bhi utaare, lekin ye to aap bhi jaanate hai ki maine khud chunaav ladane kii ichha kabhi nahin rakhi
 The workers have always been told that our responsibility is to find the best people in the society and bring them into politics
 unhen chunaav ladane ke liye taiyaar karnaa
 If we believe that we are the best then our search will end
 rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithkon main bhi maine ye prastaav kai baar rakhaa ki sanghatan main jimmedaar padon par baithe logon ko chunaav nahin ladanaa chahie
 And see, where did this politics bring us? It is right to aspire to contest elections, to become a minister, but wrong to ask questions? Today senior members like Shanti Bhushan are being openly insulted
 80 saal kii umr main kya party ke us saadhaaran sadsy ko apni raay rakhane kaa adhikaar nahin? samvidhan kii dhara VI a (a) iv main hamane likhaa he ki party ke har sadsy ko (jo jimmedaar padon par nahin he) apni raay saarvajanik manch par rakhane kaa adhikaar hoga
 We had formed a party in which any ordinary member has the right to disagree with the views of Sonia Gandhi or Narendra Modi
 jindagibhar saaf raajnneeti kii ummid lekar baithe us bujurg ko umr ke aakhri padaav main ummid kii ek kiran dikhaai di thi
 i know that by putting eyes in their eyes you cannot say what the spokesperson of AAP says on TV
 kya hamaari party main ab bhinn raay rakhane waalon ko gaddaar hi kaha jayega?aapke paas 12 hajaar logon ke dastakhat lekar aayaa tha
 Take protection to request aapane kaha tha, 'is andolan kaa ek lakshya yah bhi he ki logon ke man se bhay samaapt ho
 They can muster up the courage to speak
 ' lekin vaastaviktaa yah he kii aaj sach kehane main hi bhay lagata he
 The army created on social media does not blame the person who leaked the internal emails of the party under a conspiracy or sent false smses by conspiring against the old party workers
 lekin aise samay jab aap desh kii raajnneeti ke betaj badshaah ho aapse sawaal karne kii himmat jutaaye use gaddaar, deshadrohi or jane kin-kin naamon se navajti he
 Are we really creating a fear-free society? i have been asking you in the meeting of the National Executive without fearing whether you are Arvind Kejriwal
 Does the country believe only Delhi? There was always courage to put this question in front of you, but asking this question today has become a bigger crime than treason
 hamane party banaai to naaraa diya tha 'aam aadmi jindabad'
 We wrote on the cap, 'I want Swaraj' and today those who talk about Swaraj are called anti-party
 hamaari party kii vichaardhaara, jo aap hi kii likhi pustak par aadhaarit he, usamen to swaraj ek bada hi paavan shabd tha
 i believe that Swaraj does not mean that an ordinary worker like me should interfere in your big decisions
 nirnay aap karen, lekin hamen apni baat to rakhane den
 Let the meeting take place
 yaa vah bhi swaraj ke khilaaf he? aapako shaayad jaankaree na ho hamaare hi kaaryakarta swaraj shabd ko upyog chutkulon main karte hai
 To ridicule those who ask questions
 aage padhein, AAP ke deshadroh kii asaliyat!330 sansthaapak sadasyon ne milakar party banaai
 We have units in over 300 districts across the country
 apane gharo ko phoonk kar hajaaro kaaryakarta is andolan kii lau ko deshbhar main jivit rakh rahe hai
 He has fifty problems, questions
 aaj party bane 3 saal ho gaye
 After the establishment, there was only one meeting of the council, that too for a day
 aaj tak un sadasyon ko kabhi suna nahin gaya
 In the last meeting you promised that the next meeting would be 3 days
 bahut minnaten kii, lekin phir bhi koi unhen sunanaa hi nahin chahta
 The formalities will be completed in the meeting on 28 March, all of them will end their membership on 31 March and then it is expected that the questioners will not be members of that council
 jaanata hum ki aapako aalochana pasand nahin, lekin mujhe chapalusee pasand nahin
 There are crores of people who praise you
 sau do sau to sawaal poochne vaale bhi ho?aap samet rashtriya kaaryakarini ke sabhi sadasyon ko mail likhakar nivedan kiya tha kii parishad kii baithak kam se kam 2-3 dinon kii rakhie
 Hear our problems and in the same mail i had also requested all the council members not to have an official meeting, we should have an informal meeting
 kya yah bhi deshadroh he? hamaari soshal media team kii samaj ke anusaar to he
 Was it a conspiracy to send the letters of 45 members to you to demand a meeting of the National Council? Before the meeting, informal before all the members could discuss, can there be any conspiracy sent to you for this purpose? What will happen if the council members share their views with each other and raise their issues in the council meeting? What are you afraid of And whom? Why did we run away from the discussion? There are hardly any members in the council who would question your leadership
 lekin aap ke naam kaa upyog kar is rajnatik andolan ko dooshit karne waalon ko nishchit bhay hona chahie
 Council members are upset with him and this meeting was named a conspiracy against Kejriwal
 khayr, ye vishwaas he ki aap ke netritv main yah party desh kii raajnneeti main ek bahut bada badlaav laaegi
 The agitators may no longer be needed
 or yah bhi vishwaas he ki aapke rahete koi galat aadmi is party main aa to saktaa he, lekin galat kaam aap use karne nahin denge
 But Arvind ji person centered change cannot be long term
 kisi prabhaavshaalee netaa dwaara banaai vyavastha keval tab tak tik paati he jab tak vah vyakti khud satta main ho
 Finally, with the help of aap's social media forces, people who come to build their future in politics do not ask questions
 dilli main itani badi jeet milane ke baad sawaal poochne kaa saahas koi samajhadaar netaa nahin kar saktaa
 This courage can only be done by those who are worried about this dream of alternative politics
 hamane andolan main apni bhoomika aise hi nibhaai
 We do not want a ticket, nor a post, nor any respect

 lekin jignesh kii musiibat har din badhati dikh rahi he
 a few days ago, the BJP had put ban ban against him in Jagana village of Central Coal Minister Haribhai Chaudhary and now his convoy has been attacked
 darasal,jignesh mevanior unke samarthak patosan gaanv main chunavi prachaar karne pahunche
 Meanwhile, Jignes' convoy was pelted with stones, in which the glass of a car belonging to a Jignesh camp was broken
 hamalavar hamalaa karke nau do gyaarah ho gaye
 Giving information about the attack to Jigneshne Garh police officer, he feared danger to his life
 jigneshne kaha ki kuch agyaat logon ne unke kafile par hamalaa kiya or is hamale main unke saath kuch bhi ho saktaa tha
 In such a situation, given the seriousness of the incident, they should get police protection
 bhaajapa or sangh ko ye nahi pataa ki unke har hamale se mujhe bhaajapa ke khilaaf ladane kii or taaqat milti ja rahi he , sanghiyon kaan khol kar sun lo ye baapu ke gujarat he mere upar hue har ek hamale ke saath tumhaari haar or badi hoti jaaegi

 He feared BJP workers behind the incident
 jigneshne twitor par is hamale kii ninda kii ortvit kiya, ‘ # gandi raajnneeti

 dalit samudaay par ho rahe atyaachaar ko lekar andolan ke baad jignesh mewaani charchaa main aae the
 The most surprising thing is that despite the attack on his convoy in the hot election environment, Jignesh did not register an FIR in the police station
 jignesh ne kaha ki chunavi maahaul main aisa karne se kanoon vyavastha bighad sakati he
 Therefore, by not registering an FIR, only the police has been called

 He further recognizes the manpower of the country and says to think for the good of the country
 vipaksh main baithe logon ko chapekar bandhu, vir saavarkar or chandrasekhar nahin dikhtepiem modi ne aage kaha ki ve laal kile se kah chuke hai ki saare pradhanmantriyon ne desh ke vikaas main yogadan diya he
 However those sitting on that side never considered the contribution of the Chapekar brothers, Veer Savarkar and Chandrasekhar in the freedom movement
 unhone isi bich charvak ke siddhant ko bhi uddhrit kiya or aam aadmi party saansad bhagwant maan par ghi ke bajaay kuch or hi lene kaa tanj ksaa
 PM Modi further says that there should be no politics on cleanliness campaign
 ve sawaal karte hai ki kya aisa bhi koi insaan he jo gandagi main rahanaa chahta he
 He once again attacked the Congress and said that the Congress questions the early arrival of the budget
 ve poochhate hai ki aakhir kya vajah rahi ki aazaadee ke kai saal baad tak bhi bajet shaam ko 5 baje pesh hota rahaa
 He opened his watch in a funny tone and told that if you hold it straight, Indian time and reverse it, British time

 Many unsubstantiated announcements were scrapped
 PM Modi said on the railway budget that earlier there were many announcements which had nothing
 unhone use khatm karne kaa kaam kiya
 He further said that the government was ready for a debate on the note ban but the opposition was only involved in giving bytes to the TV
 unhone isi kram main kaaka haathrasi ko bhi uddhrit karte hue vipaksh par nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said, "interface searches are hidden, you will find the right report
" dilli main south emsidi ne avaidh parking, kooda failaane vaale or plastic bag ke istemaal karne waalon par beete ek maheene ke dauraan kul 14 lakh 22 hazaar 726 rupye kaa jurmaana lagaaya he
 South MCD ran a special campaign for this in October
 nigam se mili jaankaree ke anusaar south emsidi ne apane sabhi zone main is vishesh muhim ko shuru kiya tha taaki tyohaaron ke maukey par bazaaro main khariddaari karne aae logon ko pareshaani naa ho
 During the campaign, along with the MCD Networking Police, action was taken on the marketers on illegal parking and sidewalks, while the spreaders of garbage were also clamped
 south emsidi ke central zone main kooda failaane vaale 140 logon ko maukey par pakadakar 9 hazaar rupye jurmaana vasula to vahiin gandagi ko lekar bhi 2 lakh 99 hazaar 300 rupye kaa jurmaana municipal court ne vasula
 In violation of the parking rules, 14 vehicles were seized and a fine of Rs 44 thousand was charged
 central zone main kareeb 100 kilo polibag jabt kiye gaye or kareeb 80 hazaar rupye kaa jurmaana vasuul kiya gaya he
 In the West Zone of South MCD, the waste throwers were fined around Rs 7,000, while 108 vehicles parked illegally were seized
 iske alaava poli bag ke stock rakhane or istemaal karne waalon se ek lakh 20 hazaar rupye kaa jurmaana vasuul kiya gaya
 In the South Zone under which most of the posh areas are covered, people did not hesitate to break the rules
 haalanki kanoon ke shikanje se wo bhi nahin bache
 In the areas under the South Zone, a fine of about Rs 2 thousand was imposed on those who throw garbage, while on the invoices made with dirt, about Rs 3 lakh 99 thousand 400 was recovered
 iske alaava avaidh parking karne par 182 vaahan chaalkon kaa chaalaan kiya gaya or unase 2 lakh rupye se bhi zyaada kaa jurmaana vasula gaya
 Here a fine of about 90 thousand rupees was recovered from the action under ban on poly bags
 najafagarh zone main polibag ke stock or istemaal par ek lakh 10 hazaar rupye kaa jurmaana vasula gaya
 Corporation officials may be patting their backs on the campaign, but the big question is whether this campaign will be limited only for a month
 kya emsidi aage bhi is muhim ko jari rakhte hue niyam todane waalon ko sabak sikhayegi
 Because if Delhi is to be kept clean, then not only one month but strict action will have to be taken in the same way throughout the year, otherwise it will not take much time to forget this one month's action

 It is worth noting that children in Kendriya Vidyalayas are admitted in five different categories
 pehali chaar shreniyon main kendra sarkaar, kendra sarkaar keswaitt santhaan, rajya sarkaar or rajya sarkaar ke swasthya sansthaanon main karyrat logon ke bachche aate hai
 In the absence of seats in these four categories, children of ordinary citizens are admitted in the fifth category
 iske alaava bade paimaane par saansad or mantri cote ke tahat daakhil kiye gaye bachche bhi kendriya vidhyalay main padhate hai
 It is believed that these steps are being taken by the Kendriya Vidyalaya administration to raise more resources

 In such a situation, if the hitchhikers had given information to the driver, showing little sympathy, then Sajal's life could have been saved
 surajeet ne bataaya ki bheed bahut zyada thi jise sanbhaalane ke liye aayojakon ne uchit kadam nahin uthaae the
 Although the organizers have dismissed the charge, saying that they have followed all the rules, but it is also true that there was no idea that such a crowd would come

 Prateik Babbar, who has been missing from Bollywood for a long time, himself has revealed that he was badly addicted to drugs
 film 'jane tu yaa jane naa' se film industry main entry karne waleector pratikki filmein kaa ek ke baad ek flop hona or actress emi jackson sang romance ke vifal hone jaisi baton ne unhen nashe kii ore dhakel diya
 But now Prateek has come out in front of the media about drug addiction and recovering from it
 mumbai mirar ko die gaye intervyuu main pratik ne bataaya he ki vah abhi bhi ricover kar rahe hai
 While Bollywood actors have often been seen hiding their drug addiction habits, Prateek's open talk about it is a commendation
 pratik ne drugs kii lat ke bare main kaha ki drugs lenaa unki personal chois thi kisi ne iske liye unhen majaboor nahin kiya
 Prateek said, 'drug addiction is like a bad marriage, so that you can come out but still it scares you
 ' pratik ne is baat kii khushi jaahir kii ki ab vah isse baahar aa rahe hai
 Now he is focusing on fitness instead of drug addiction
 pratikane aage yah bhi kaha-'shaayad logon ko lagata hoga ki kisi bhi bollywood sileb ko nashe kii lat hona aam baat he lekin mere saath aisa nahin tha
 i got intoxicated because of the reality of my life
 meraa bachapan bahut uljhan se bharaa rahaa he
 Which left such questions in my mind, to which i never got an answer
 in sawaalon se khud ko raahat dene ke liye maine drugs ko chunaa
 Prateena said, 'accepting this addiction wrongly is the first step to recovery
 main awarenes laana chahta hum or ek aisa video banane ja rahaa hum jisamen isse jujh rahe insaan kii sirf ekatarfa kahani hi nahi bayaan hogi
 On the question of making a comeback in Bollywood, Prateik said that he is looking for good characters and story in films
 aaj kal net, banking or get kii pariksha main safal hone ke liye aapako quanteteteve aptitude kii thikthak jaankaree honi jaruri he
 In such a situation, we are specifically telling you what to do and what not to do to succeed in this exam
 basics se shuruyaat karen-ab is baat se to sabhi waakif hai ki isamen koi tayshuda silebus nahin hota, lekin basics kii jaankaree har sambhav madad to kar hi detii he
 Many problems are solved by just paying attention to basics
 fundamental kaa dhyaan rakhen-kisi bhi topic kii shuruyaat se pehle ustopic ke fundaclear hone chahie
 For this, you can consult the experts of a subject as well as teachers of the subject concerned
 ho saktaa he ki koi topic aapako mahatvapurn na lage lekin use chhodana nasamajhi hogi
 Significantly, questions can be asked from anywhere
 lagaataar practice-ab aisa to nahin he ki sabhi ko saare sawaalon ke jawaab maaloom hi hon
 In this case, it may be beneficial to solve last year's question paper
 samay kaa management behad jaruri hota he
 Continue to practice for speed
 pichhali galatiyon kaa akalan karen or unhen aage karne se bachein
 Follow the systematic approach - first increase according to the topic and then solve the whole question paper later
 shuruyaat main paaramparik dharre par chalem or baad main short cat kaa bhi istemaal kar sakate hai
 Also take care that there is no disturbance in the hurry
 mahatvapurn formule, theory or teble yaad rakhen-quantitative Aptitude main kai formule, theoram or teble se jude sawaal puche jate hai
 You can save your valuable time by remembering them
 unhen kisi panne par likh lene se khaali hone par ek baar pard lene se hi khaasaa kaam ho jaataa he
 Prepare square root and cube root in advance
 majboot or kamjor hisse ko chinhit karen-kisi bhi pariksha main achche ank hasil karne ke liye aapako apni majbootee or kamajori kii samaj honi chahie
 Half the problems are easy to understand
 kamjor paksh ko na choden or is baat kaa vishesh khyal rakhen ki kis hisse se sawaal adhik aate hai
 Keep safe from all kinds of questions - It happens many times that you know the answer to a question but leave those questions in a hurry
 isamen paarangat hone ke liye aap pichley varsh ke sawaalon ko hal karnaa na bhoolen
 Read the questions carefully - It happens many times that the answers to the questions are obtained by just reading the questions
 yadi aap dhyanpurvak sawaalon ko dekhenge to unhen mushkil nahin paaenge
 Time management - Instead of giving more time to such questions in which you are stuck, move ahead
 ant main samay bachane par aap un fanse sawaalon ko banane kaa prayaas kar sakate hai
 Take care of negative marking - There are many exams which have negative marking, so avoid hitting

 The sequel of 'don' i
e
 'don-2' was released
 5 saal baad don kii nigahen hai germany ke douse central bank par
 Don wants to blow up the printing plates printed here so that the hassle of robbing the note is over, but there are many obstacles in this path like blood-thirsty drug dealers and Interpol officer Roma
 shahrukh jaisaa top star, baari bharkam bajet, malaysia bangkok or jamarni kii khubasurat lokations videshi sadakon par takaraati kaaren or dushman ko furti se thikaane lagaataa don impressive he
 However, this action and thrill is not enough, due to which the first half seems slow
 bich main ye ziddee magar chaalaak don achche dialogs bhi martha he jaise maut to sabko aani he lekin is baar jail jane main hi meraa phayda he, lekin film kii kahani jaraa bhi hatakar nahin
 a number of Hollywood and Bollywood films have been made on the bank robbery
 second half main film girti he jab bank dakaiti ko anjaam diya jaataa he
 Looting such a big bank is not as easy as Don showed
 bank dakaiti ke vakt sara nigociation don or interpol officer roma ke bich hota he
 In such a situation, what is the role of the German police, Don's obsession for Roma is understandable, but Roma, who hates Dawn fiercely, does not kill Don
 mujeec bhi shahrukh kii pichhali don kaa zyada behatar tha
 i expected more from Don's remake than 'don-2' because the script of 'don-2' is original but it seems like a raw remake of a Hollywood film
 everej film 'don-2' ke liye meri reating he 2

 It is reported from the Congress that the party, apart from Rahul Gandhi, is seriously considering making someone else as president and the search for a new party president has started
 congress ke varisht netaaon kii maane to party kaa nayaa adhyaksh gaiyr gandhi hoga yani nae adhyaksh kaa gandhi parivaar se koi lenaa dena nahin hoga
 Also, it will be announced in the next two to three months
 rahul gandhi philhal do dinon ke vynad daure par hai jahaan baari bheed unke swaagat ke liye umadi thi
 Many had placards in their hands that we need you
 magar jab tak congress main nae adhyaksh ko lekar sthiti saaf nahin ho jaati party main bhram kii sthiti bani rahegi
 Any Congress leader, no matter what level he is or whether he is a member of the Congress Working Committee today, has no idea what is going on in the Congress
 vajah saaf he ki loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey aane ke baad jab se rahul gandhi ne congress ke adhyaksh pad se istipha diya he wo ek yaa do netaaon ke alaava kisi se bhi nahin mili hai
 That is, no one knows what the next step of Rahul Gandhi will be or what is on his mind
 yahi nahin unhone congress adhyaksh pad ke liye priyanka gandhi ke naam par bhi vito laga diya he
 Because of all this, the Congress seems to be devoid of leaders at the moment and due to this, the discipline of the party is being affected, especially in the states
 telugana main congress ke 12 vidhayak party chhodkar tiares main shaamil ho gaye hai
 That is, in a way, the entire party has merged with TRS
 usee tarah punjab main captain banaam navjot singh siddhu kaa vivaad itnaa tool pakadaa ki captain ko siddhu ke khilaaf karrwai karte hue unka vibhaag badalanaa padaa
 The Captain also waited a long time to get a signal from the party high command, but when no instructions came from Delhi, he himself changed Sidhu's department
 kuch aise hi halaat rajasthan main he, jahaan mukhyamantri ashok gahalot or upmukhyamantri sachin payalat ke bich matbhed or manabhed kii khabaren roj aati hai
 The Congress high command should have resolved to fight both of them face to face, but Gehlot and Pilot are still blaming each other for losing all 25 seats in Rajasthan
 haryana kii baat karen to loksabhaa chunaav main haar kii samiksha ke liye bulaai baithak main itani tu-tu main-main hui ki pradesh adhyaksh ne yah kahana shuru kar diya ki mujhe faansee par lataka do, mujhe goli maar do vaigrah-vagairah
 All this was happening in the presence of senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad
 kinartak main roj congress ke vidhayak apane hi pradesh sarkaar ke khilaaf bayaanbaji karne se baj nahin aate hai or mukhyamantri kumaraswami yah kehete hue ruunaase dikhaai dete hai ki mujhe thik se kaam nahin karne diya ja rahaa he
 Some similar news is coming from Goa where around 10 Congress mlas are preparing to form their own group and all this is happening due to the inaction of Rahul Gandhi
 ab congress ke netaa or kaaryakarta yah poochne lage hai ki aakhir congress kaa adhyaksh abhi koun he
 If Rahul is not the president, then why is there no early decision on the new president? People have started saying that either Rahul should stay or go but the decision should be made quickly
 ab congress netaaon par yah dabaav badhata ja rahaa he ki rajyon main congress netaaon kii badhati anushaasanheenata rokane ke liye nae adhyaksh par jald faisla le liya jaae
 This is the reason that the news has started coming that the Congress is going to get a new non-gandhi president within the next two-three months

 Also the investigation of this case is still going on

 Ratul should join the inquiry immediately
 court ne ratul ko somvaar tak giraftaar se raahat dete hue unase kaha ki aaj hi 5 baje idi daftar jaaen or jaanch main shaamil hon
 Ratul has again reached the ED office
 unase poochtacha jari he
 However, his lawyer kept saying that till Monday, Ratul should also be relieved from the inquiry, because the case is to be heard again on Monday
 aapako bataa den ki ratul puri mozarabear company ke maalik hai or bade kaarobaari hai

 But in those days the pension was very low, so what started in childhood, shortage remained
 har ek baat pe kehete ho tum, ki tu kya he,tumhiin kaho ki ye andaaz-e-guftagu kya he
 
 
 He studied Persian, Urdu and Arabic, and started writing at an early age
 kabhi-kabhi vah upnaam main 'gaalib' kii jagah 'asad' bhi likhte the
 By the age of 12, by the time his coin started running in Urdu and Persian Ghazal

 By marriage at a young age, both ishq-e-haqqi and ishq-e-mizaji mastered
 ye ishk nahin asaan, itnaa hi samaj lijai,ek aag kaa dariyaa he, or duubake janaa he
 
 
 But this period of rebellion did not last long

 Who was able to write before Ghalib and after him? kaha jaataa he ki isi daur main unke saat bachche hue, lekin unamem se koi bhi jinda nahin rahaa sakaa
 In order to overcome this sorrow, he joined the liquor, poetry

 But that was the last phase of the Mughal Sultanate, in itself so shabby and irresponsible that Ghalib would have got support? There was no significant increase in his financial condition

 baavjood iske ki badshaah se mili sammaan kii vajah se unki ginati dilli ke mashhoor logon main hone lagi thi
 Ghalib mentioned his bad habits, especially alcoholism, in such a way - 'ghalib' i still drink sometimes on the hidden liquor, in roz-e-abro o shab-e-mahtab, when a book on Mirza Ghalib came, it was claimed that Mirza was so fond of drinking that there was no night in which he did not drink

 As a sex teacher, i can say with confidence that there are many examples of bedroom crisis that many times men bring complaints about their 'sex-free' wife
 yah dekh main uljhan main pad gai ki pati hi kyon sex kii chahat rakhte hai or patniyaan kyon thandi pad jaati hai
 i decided to delve deep into this and talked to many women about losing interest in their husbands
 thakaaoo gharelu kaamkaaj ke saath bacchon, pati, saas-sasur kii seva or pati se kisi tarah ke bhaavnaatmak samarthan ke bina kaamkaaji aurat na sirf pati se zyada kamaati he, balki ghar chalaane main bhi zyada badi bhoomika nibhaati he
 For most, sex is not just intimate physical activity, but its mental and emotional aspects are also large
 jis rishte main bhedbhaavmulak stri-purush bhoomikaaon kaa bantwaaraa sakht hota he or koi bhaavnaatmak judaav na ho, usamen aksar sex se virakti kaa bhav adhik dekha jaataa he
 This is more often the case with women who, while swinging between home and office, eventually lose interest in sex with their husbands, who neither give them the respect nor support they deserve
 suvidha kii shadiaisi 'shaadi' jo sirf ek-duusare ke ehsaan ke bharose ho, zyaadaatar ke liye baari ho jaati he
 a male-dominated society treats women only as sex goods, which dissuades them from wanting sex
 swasth rishta to vah he jisamen do log ek-duusare ke prati sahaj dhang se pyaar barasaaen, jo antat: unhen hambistar kare
 But if the only means of love of a couple is sex, then that too can create the urge for emotional attachment in both partners
 romance or pyaar ke ishaaron kii chahat rakhane vaali patniyaan aksar yah paakar sex main dilchaspee kho baithti hai ki pati tabhi dhyaan dete hai jab unhen jarurat mahasoos hoti he
 Actions before and after we get to bed have a great impact on the feeling of sex
 vaivaahik jivan ke rojaanaa ke jhanjhat-jhamele bhi 'aashiqui ke pal' se dur le jate hai
 Now talking about sex and children! In an attempt to become an 'obedient Indian wife', women hesitate to discuss sex with their husbands because they are not considered 'kulata'
 is bebuniyaad laanchhan se bachane ke liye kai mahilaayein apni fantasiyon, samasyaon or sex jivan ko sukhad banane par charchaa karne se parhez karti hai
 Sex satisfaction always arises from a sense of satisfaction in a relationship that is impossible to happen in a society where spouses are unable to talk openly in bed and sex is linked to morality and social status
 har kisi ke liye alag-alag baaten hoti hai jo antat: icchhaaen jagaati hai
 Relying only on the sexual satisfaction of one partner and not taking care of your physical desires discards both partners
 sirf samay or abhyaas ke saath hi sex santushti kaa bhav viksit hota he or uske baad bhi lagaataar samvaad kii jarurat bani rahati he
 Women, who consider their husbands to be 'fair-skinned', also do not experience bedtime activities
 sex kii koshish to hoti he, use samajhane kii nahin, jaise partner kii jaruraton ko samajhe bagaiyr apni sex ichchhaaon kii purti kaa khyaal
 Wow, wow, thanks to husbands who take care of their satisfaction at the time of sex often make the happiness of wives meaningless which either accepts the feeling of false satisfaction or continues to work without it
 or koi or santushti ke bhav ki bina sex main kyon saath de jab use hastmaithun se zyada santushti milti ho? internet par sex ko lekar achhut jaankariyon or sansadhano ke is daur main aapke paas apane partner ko khush karne ke kai tareeke uplabdh hai
 Women who prefer not to have sex without satisfaction are actually due to the same men who are not proficient in this art and do not even try
 so, aashcharya nahin ki shaadi ke rishte aakhirkaar sexvihin jindagiyon main badal jate hai

 ' One tradition that is flourishing in India is the 'bain' tradition
 jab aap apane vivek kaa istemaal na kar paaen to sidhaa bain kar ke chhutkaaraa pie, aisa hi kuch pichley kai saalon se sarkarein bharat main karti ai hai
 British documentary maker Leslie Uddwin has been leaving her family in India for the last 2 years to make a documentary on Nirbhaya rape on 16 December
 lekin jaise hi is documentry ke kuch ansh main, jisamen apradhi mukesh singh ne vivaadit bayaan diya he, bibisi ne prakashit kiya to media se lekar sansad tak bavaal ho gaya or aakhirkaar ab lesley ko is documentry ko release karwaane ke liye court ke chakkar kaatane padenge
 One assumption that has been made in the people, is that this documentary is showing the side of criminals, giving them a chance to speak
 lekin lesley ne ye saafe bataaya he ki wo balaatkaar kii maansikta ko apni documentry ke zariye dikhaanaa chaahati hai
 This is not the first interview of a criminal
 afzal guru kaa bhi jail se intervyuu liya ja chukaa he
 a few days ago, Ved Pratap was also claiming to have interviewed Vedic Hafiz Saeed
 kya sarkaar ne iske khilaaf koi kadam uthaaya tha? agar kisi apradhi kaa intervyuu liya jaataa he to ye usko badhaava dena nahin hota
 And it is not even necessary that it is showing its favor
 jab news channelon par ham hinsa, balaatkaar or raajnneetigyon ke mahila virdohi bayaan dikhaate hai yaa un par charchaa karte hai to kya iske peeche kii manshaa us aparaadh ke paksh main hawa bananaa hota he? jab tak aap puri film naa dekhen to faisla kaise karenge ki nayak koun he or khalanaayak koun he? Rajnath Singh says that the rules related to making this documentary have been violated
 lekin is dacumentry ko banane ke liye grih mantralay kii ijazat or apradhi mukesh singh kii likhit ijazat lesley ke paas he
 Venkaiah Naidu has said that this is a conspiracy to tarnish India's name worldwide, so we will ban it
 lekin naidu ji ye baat bhul jate hai ki ye documentry puri duniya main dikhaai jaaegi or aapaki sarkaar is par bain lagaakar phir se is desh kii sankeern maansikta ko puure vishwa main ujagar kar rahi he
 Whatever Mukesh Singh has said in the documentary, everything has been repeated in Parliament, the panelists have repeated during the debate on the news channels
 phir pratibandh kaa kya matlab rah jaataa he? ho saktaa he ki is film main koi nayi baat samaaj ke saamne naa aa rahi ho, lekin jo baat samaaj main pehle se hi he, use is film main dikhaae jane par pratibandh kyon? is documentry main samvedansheel content hone kii vajah se ehtiyaat barti ja sakati hai
 Like you can broadcast it even at 11 o'clock by not showing it in prime time
 aisa ehtiyaati kadam 'big bos' ke ek sizan ke liye bhi dikhaaya gaya tha
 It can cover the faces of criminals and lawyers, as news channels do as a precaution
 sarkaar is tarah bain laga kar sirf apana pallaa jhaad rahi he
 Even if the court has asked to ban its broadcasting, the government should still stand with Leslie in favor of its broadcasting or else ensure that it will ban every anti-women statement
 kyon ye sach logon ke saamne nahin aana chahie ki jail main apradhi sudhar nahin rahe, apradhi ban rahe hai? kyon nahin ye paksh aana chahie ki ek kam padhe likhe garib tabake ke apradhi se lekar ek padhe likhe ucchwargeey aadmi kii soch ladakiyon ko lekar lagbhag ek si he
 But our truth is that we will continue to irrigate this 'ban' tradition without seeing and thinking about anything
 kyonki ye 'selective' krantikariyon kaa desh hai
 Where someone is rewarded and punished for the same thing

 unhone kaha ki bijepi ne unke bayaan ko galat tareeke se pesh kiya he, wo isaki kadi ninda karte hai
 Senior Congress leader and former Union Minister CP Joshi, while addressing a gathering in Nathdwara in Rajasthan on Thursday, said that only Brahmin can speak about religion
 unhone piem modi or kendriya mantri uma bharti kii jati par sawaal khadey karte hue kaha, aapako pataa he ki uma bharti or piem modi kis jati ke hai
 At the same time, he also targeted Sadhvi Ritambhara, who was associated with the Ram temple movement, and said what caste she belongs to, what do people know about religion

 Not all the leaders of the Congress but all the leaders, whether it is CP Joshi or Raj Babbar, the language they are using, it is clear that there is frustration in the Congress
 unhone kaha ki unke netaa hataasha se bhare hai kyonki chhattisgarh, madhya pradesh or rajasthan teenon rajyon se congress is baar bhi chunaav haar rahi he
 He further said that talking about the caste caste of CP Joshi and asking the caste of Modi and Uma Bharti and saying that only Brahmins are the officers of religion can talk about religion

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi said that the Narendra Modi government was responsible for instigating the 2002 Gujarat riots, while the Congress government tried to stop the 1984 anti-sikh riots
 haalanki, rahul ne 84 ke dangon par koi afsos nahin jataayaa
 Rahul, who is considered to be a rival of Modi in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, said that he is not scared of Modi and the Congress will defeat the BJP in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 ek nijee samachar channel ko die saakshaatkaar main rahul ne modi par sidhaa prahaar karte hue kaha, 'sachaai yah he ki 1984 main begunaah log maare gaye or begunaahon kaa maaraa janaa bhayaavah cheez he jo nahin hona chahie
 The difference between Gujarat and 1984 is that (2002) riots involved the government of Gujarat
 ' During the interview, when Rahul was asked why he is holding him responsible when the court gave a clean chit to Modi, the Congress vice president said, "he was the chief minister when the Gujarat riots took place
 gujarat sarkaar darasal dangon ko or bhadkaa or badha rahi thi
 ' dilli ke sikh virdohi dangon or gujarat ke dangon main sarkaron kii bhoomika ke antar ko rekhaankit karte hue rahul ne kaha, 'saadhaaran sa antar yah he ki 1984 main sarkaar jansanhaar main shaamil nahin thi
 She was involved in Gujarat
 ' unhone kaha ki 1984 main congress sarkaar dangon ko bhadkaa nahin rahi thi yaa unamem madad nahin kar rahi thi, balki sarkaar ne hinsa ko rokane kii koshish kii thi
 When Rahul was again strongly asked how he could target Modi on the Gujarat riots, he said, "it is not me, a large number of people saw that the Gujarat government was actively involved in the riots
" ' Asked if he would apologize for the 1984 riots, or whether he felt that there was no need, Rahul said, 'first of all, i was not involved in these riots at all
 aisa nahin tha ki main iskaa hissaa tha
 "with this, he admitted," some Congressmen were possibly involved in the 1984 anti-sikh riots and have been punished for this
 ' Asked if he would apologize on behalf of the Congress party, he said, 'I think these riots were a horror like all riots
 khulkar kahuun to main congress party ke kriyakalapon (oparation) main shaamil nahin thi
 ' rahul se poocha gaya ki kya vah pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke is najariye se sahamat hai ki modi ne ahmedabad kii sadakon par nirdosho ke 'narsanhaar' kaa netritv kiya, unhone kaha, 'pradhanmantri jo kah rahe hai vah tathy he
 (it) happened in Gujarat and people died
 ' Asked whether he was avoiding a direct confrontation with Modi by not becoming the Prime Ministerial candidate from the Congress, Rahul said, "to understand this question, you have to understand something, who is Rahul Gandhi and then this question You will get the answer of what Rahul Gandhi is afraid of and who is not
 ' Asked by the BJP his perspective on the prime ministerial candidate, he said, 'I think we will defeat the BJP in the next elections
 
 i will win the election
 main aashwast hum
 He said that the Congress is 'ready for war' and is 'winning'
 yah puche jane par ki agar congress chunaav nahin jitati he, to kya vah isaki jimmedaari lenge, rahul ne kaha, 'agar ham nahin jite, main party kaa upaadhyaksh hum, main jimmedaari luungaa
 On Modi being made the prime ministerial candidate, he said, "BJP believes in centering power with one person

 ugte surya ko arghya dene kii reeti to kai vraton or tyoharon main he
 But the tradition of offering arghya to the setting sun is usually only in Chhath Vrat
 dharm ke saath-saath vigyaan se bhi judaa he chhath vrath or puja kaa rishta
 Why do Kartik Masses give to the Shashthi of Shukla Paksha, Arghya to the rising Sun
 - subah, dopaher or shaam teen samay surya dev vishesh rup se prabhavi hote hai- subah ke vakt surya kii aradhana se sehat behatar hoti he- dopaher main surya kii aradhana se naam or yash badhata he- shaam ke samay surya kii aradhana se jivan main sampannataa aati he- shaam ke samay surya apni duusari patni pratyusha ke saath rahete hai- isliye pratyusha ko arghya dena turant laabh detaa he- jo duubate surya kii upasna karte hai ,wo ugte surya kii upasna bhi jarur karenjyotish ke jaankaron kii maane to ast hote surya ko arghyadene kii parampara insaani jindagi har tarah kii pareshaani dur karne kii shakti rakhti he
 Then the problem is related to health or personal life
 to aaie dekhte hai ki dhalate surya ko arghya dekar aap koun –koun si museebaton se chhutkaaraa paa sakate hai
 Who should give arghya to the setting sun? - Those who have been caught in the lawsuit without any reason - Those who have any work stuck in the government department - People whose eyesight is decreasing - People who have stomach problems Continuous - Students who are repeatedly failing in the exam, it is glorified that Chhata Maiya is the unwavering hope of Lord Suryadev from the Chaturthi of Shukla Paksha of Kartik month to the date of Saptami

 The comments jab unase tendulkar se hui pehali mulaakaat ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, sach kahuun to main kaaphi sharminda hua tha ki maine bataur tej gendbaaj use khaarij kar diya tha
 Lily will say goodbye to MRF after 25 years of service

 He said, i was lucky to see him before he made his international debut in Test cricket and then i knew that he would be among the best players in the world
 jab unase tendulkar se hui pehali mulaakaat ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, sach kahuun to main kaaphi sharminda hua tha ki maine bataur tej gendbaaj use khaarij kar diya tha
 Lily will say goodbye to MRF after 25 years of service
