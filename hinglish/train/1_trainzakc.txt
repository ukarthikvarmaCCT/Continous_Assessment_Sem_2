 ) The 10th session of India Today Conclave East was strongly debated
 bahes main indian statistical institute kegarga chatarji tiemasi kaa paksh rakhaa, vahiin ol india democratic voomons association kii malini bhattacharya ne sipiai-em kii pairvi kii
 Jai Prakash Majumdar, vice-president of Paschim bangalbjp, spoke in the debate
 bahes main garga chatarji ne pashchim bengal ke haalia dangon par raay dete hue kaha yel uniwarsity kii ek study kaa zikr kiya
 He said that according to this study, only one party benefits from riots in the Indian subcontinent and that party is the Bharatiya Janata Party
 unhone kaha kidangaya hinsa jo bhi bhadakaae phayda sirfabijepico hi hoga
 Therefore, this formula is being worked on in West Bengal
 garga ne bijepi ko aagaah kiya ki pashchim bengal ke log bijepi ke is shadyantra kaa khulkar muqabla karenge
 He said, "we should remember that our mother in Bengal has two legs, not four legs, and the BJP should remember that her mother has no hands, while our mother has ten hands, these ten hands With this, we will eradicate every kind of conspiracy against Bengal
 "bahes main shirkat karte hue bijepi netaa jai majumdaar ne pashchim bengal ke dangon par kaha ki ye voton ke liye sattadhari party kii sajeesh he
 Jai Majumdar said, "communal disharmony is being created by the ruling party in this state for the ruling party
 unhone kaha ki agar pashchim bengal main dangon main bahari logon kaa haath he to yahaan kii police aise tatwon ko giraftaar kyon nahin karti he? aakhir lau and order kaa matlab kya he? unhone marks kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki unhone dharm ko janata ke liye opium bataaya tha, lekin mamata ne dharm ko vot bank bana diya, jabaki modi dharm ko samaaj kaa back bone bataate hai, yahi vichaardhaara kaa fark he
 Malini Bhattacharya attacked TMC and raised the question as to how RSS emerged in West Bengal, how did this organization spread its feet here? How did it come, could TMC not stop it? Malini said that as long as the Left was in power in West Bengal, the BJP existed in the state, but the party was marginalized
 unhone kaha ki tiemasi or bijepi ke bich upree taur par raajnneetik pratidwandita to he, lekin andar se donon partiyaan mili hui hai
 He said that both the parties create fear in the public and give assurance of giving security to a particular group
 unhone sweekaar kiya ki is tarah kii raajnneeti se sipiai-em ko voton kaa nuksaan hua he, kyonki sipiai-em janata ke adhikaar kii ladaai ladati he
 Thousands of people have been forced to leave their homes due to heavy fire in canada ke bade bhubhag main 100 se adhik sthanon par bheeshan aag lagi he, jiske kaaran hajaaron logon ko apane ghar chhodkar jane ke liye majaboor hona padaa he
 Local officials said in a recent report that only 118 sites have been set on fire in Saskatchewan, of which 20 have been reported as out of control by the authorities
 sainya bal praant main pahunchane lage hai or canadai sarkaar ne kaha he ki vah ek damakal bal samet 1400 javaanon ko vahaan bhejegi
 More than 13,000 people are living in community centers hundreds of kilometers from their homes
 unhen ek saptaah purv baahar nikaala gaya tha
 It is very difficult for him, said Jim Reiter, Saskatchewan's Government Relations Minister
 unhone kaha ki mausam kii badalati paristhitiyon ke kaaran logon ke waapas aane kii tithi tay nahin he

 CBSE exam question papers were leaked and canceled, but students are saying that many question papers were leaked
 jinke ilaake main chori nahin hui, prashn patr li nahin hue, un chaatro ko abhi tak samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki unhen kis baat kii sazaa mili he
 When there is no ability to test, then what was the hurry to conduct the tenth examination? ek pariksha kii baat ho to vishwaas kar liya jaae ki doshiyon ko baksha nahin jayega magar yahaan to har duusari pariksha ke doshi satta main baithe logon ko bakshish dekar aapako gunaahagaar bana jate hai, gunaahagaar is myne main ki aapaki yahi galati thi ki aap in baton par vishwaas kar baithe
 Vyapam convicts are still roaming today
 jaanch hi ho rahi he, sunwaayee hi ho rahi he isliye jab yah koi kah de ki gunaahagaaron ko sakht sazaa milegi to aap 20 lakh mata pita khud ko gunaahagaar samaj len or maan len ki aapako sazaa mil chuki he
 Many parents and students are emailing us about what kind of trouble they are facing
 jantar mantar par kuch mata-pita or chaatro ne prashn patron ke li hone ke virodh main narebaazi kii
 They demand that the entire examination be repeated again because leaks of different question papers are being reported from many places
 in maangon ko lekar hamen saavdhaanee baratani hogi
 Delhi Police has constituted the SIT to investigate this
 15 jagahon par chaape maare hai or kai logon se poochtacha kii he
 Police has asked CBSE what is the process of accessing the question papers to the examination center
 kuch chaatro to yah bhi daawa kar rahe hai ki biolji kaa paper bhi li hua he
 Students are also talking about the accountancy paper being leaked

 In the prime time of March 28, we had shown the news of fees for the private medical college of Uttarakhand
 jis tarah maanav sansaadhan mantri prashn patr li hone par raat bhar so nahin paae, us tarah to nahin magar jitani der jaagaa utani der sochataa rahaa ki kahin ye aarthik gulaami to nahin he
 If it is not economic slavery then what else is there
 aap ek medical kalege main admician lete hai phir pataa chalata he ki uski fees 7 lakh se 23 lakh ho jaati he
 If you can not leave the middle education now and take a loan, then it will be out of your capacity, so now while studying in college, you will become a slave even after that the condition will be the same
 ajukeshan lone lete hai magar 7 lakh kii fees 23 lakh kar dene kaa tuk samaj nahin aayaa
 Is there this arrangement to get these students to sell and grab everything, if that is the case then it is called economic slavery because now if they want to get rid of it then they have to pay 60 lakhs to leave the college
 bahut darshakon ne kaha ki privet medical kalege he, paise waalon ke bachche padhate hai
 Those who have black money here
 yah dharna he
 Some seats in private medical colleges are bought by people with money, but to say that all children are like this would be wrong
 isliye hamane kai maa baap or chaatro se poochtacha kii ki aap kis aarthik shrenee ke hai
 It turned out that all of them are students from ordinary homes who bring good numbers in NEET entrance exams
 inhone duusare privet kalege main isliye admician nahin liya kyonki vahaan 7 lakh kii fees thi or uttarakhand ke privet medical kalejon kii fees 5 lakh thi
 Many students belong to a very simple family
 unke liye ab lone lenaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 The way the fees have been increased is inhuman
 kisi bhi saadhaaran parivaar ke liye do maheene ke bheetar 30 lakh se lekar 40 lakh tak kii fees kaa intazaam karnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 They would have known that the fees for one year would be 23 lakh, then they would not come here
 aakhir koi sarkaar kisi privet medical kalege ko 400 percent fees badhaane kii anumati kaise de sakati he
 In protest, 650 students of medical colleges are sitting on a dharna
 inamen se aadhe uttarakhand ke hi hai
 Their background is also very simple
 aam darshakon ne pehali pratikriya isi tarah se di ki privet medical kalege ke hai to amir gharaanon ke hai isliye do maheene main 30 se 40 lakh rupee de sakate hai
 But now you can understand that injustice is being done to them
 ye aarthik rup se sakasham nahin hai
 Can not pay a fee of 20 lakhs
 aap jaanate hai ki uttarakhand main sarkaar ne privet medical kalege ko fees badhaane kii chhot de di he jiske kaaran embibies ke pratham, dwitiya or tritiy varsh kii fees is tarah badi he ki sunakar aap chakkar kha jaaenge
 - First year fees have been increased from 6 lakh 70 thousand to 23 lakh - duusare saal kii fees 7 lakh 25 hazaar se badhaakar 20 lakh kar di gai he - The fees for the third year has been increased from 7 lakh 36 thousand to 26 lakh yahi nahin jo chaatr duusare varsh main pahunch chuke hai unase pehle saal kii bakaayaa raashi lee jaaegi yani unhen 40 lakh rupee dene padenge
 No one can pay such a fee
 yah is vakt kii bahut badi khabar he
 If the government does not pay attention to this then these parents will be doomed to make their children a doctor
 inamen se zyaadaatar saadhaaran pariwaron ke hai
 It is being said that an affidavit was taken from the students that the college will fix the fees
 admician ke vakt har koi sin kar detaa he lekin koi yah nahin soch saktaa ki 6 lakh se sidhe badhaakar fees 22 lakh kar di jaaegi
 You can understand what will be happening on parents and students at this time
 ek maa ko samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki 31 may tak 41 lakh kii fees kahaan se laakar denge kyonki uske donon bachche vahaan padhate hai
 Many people will think that this is a joke, everyone has money, just think once you put yourself in their place, would you like to pay a fee of 23 lakh instead of seven lakh
 kuch maa baap ne kaha he ki agar ve apana ghar baar bech bhi den tab bhi itnaa paisa nahin de sakate hai
 Should not the Minister of Human Resources to the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand take initiative on this crisis
 kuch ne to pradhanmantri ko bhi patr likhaa he
 Our colleague Dinesh Mansera told that Guru Ram Rai Medical College is run by a very prestigious trust
 guru ram raay sikhon ke saatven ve guru har raay ji ke putr the
 He established his camp in 1676
 deraa e doon ke naam se iskaa naam dehradun padaa
 Religious fair is held here every year
 guru ram raay trust ke ajukeshan mishan ke kareeb 150 se zyaada guru ram raay ke naam se hindi or english medium skool chalate hai
 There are nursing colleges, agricultural colleges, Sanskrit colleges, degree colleges, a thousand bed hospital
 150 seat vaala medical kalege he
 There is a wealth of billions
 paise kii koi kami nahin he
 Nevertheless, the fees of the medical college has been increased from 6 lakh 70 thousand to 23 lakh
 dinesh kaa kahana he ki unhone bhi khud kai bacchon kii prishthbhumi check kii he, koi bhi itani fees nahin de saktaa
 The fee of 6 lakh was the highest, but 23 lakh is like a nuclear explosion
 mujhase inaki sthiti dekhi nahin ja rahi he, aakhir sarkaar ne kaise 400 fisadi fees badhaane kii anumati di he
 Dinesh Mansera says that no one is ready to speak on behalf of Guru Ram Rai Medical College or Trust
 saamne aae bhi to hemavathi nandan bahuguna vishvavidlaay ke vaais chancelar jo khud fees badhaane ke liye hoicourt gaye the
 The High Court said that the committee constituted by the government will decide the fees, but instead of the committee, the cabinet of the government decided
 maamla ek kalege kaa nahin balki teen privet kalege kaa he
 This fee increase of Uttarakhand is frightening
 madhya pradesh main medical pravesh pariksha main dhaandhlee ke khilaaf ladane vaale anand raay ne bataaya ki unke rajya main bhi 20 lakh fees nahin he
 Anand Rai is also a petitioner in the Delhi High Court in the question paper that was leaked in the neet's post graduate examination last year
 yahi nahin post graduate kii fees 10 lakh se tees lakh prati varsh kar di gai he
 You will not be able to hear the messages of the students
 unki neend ud gai he
 They all come from the middle class background
 kisi tarah ek baar lone le liya ki doctor to ban jaaenge magar unhen nahin pataa tha ki 6 lakh kii jagah 23 lakh or 10 lakh kii jagah 30 lakh fees ho gai
 Our opposition is sleeping, governments have become careless or else nobody gets drunk so much

 No need to die, but if a careless minister is watching this show then he should think for a time
 in chaatro ke saath ye ninsaphi nahin honi chahie
 This is sheer economic slavery

 is pariksha main 15 aise sawaal the jo yaa to galat the yaa unke do do jawaab banate the
 If the students created a ruckus, 5 questions have been deleted, but the students say that there is a risk of injustice to them
 phir se puri pariksha honi chahie
 There is a stay from the High Court but it is not enough
 ye chaatr indore ke bhavarakuan ilaake main dharne par chaar dinon se baithe hai, 29 march ko vahaan se madhya pradesh lok seva ayog tak march bhi nikaala
 Madhya Pradesh has another rule
 agar aapako lagata he ki pariksha main poocha gaya prashn galat he to har chaatr ko chunauti deni hogi
 The challenging student will have to pay 100 rupees for every question, that is, this time 1500 rupees will have to be given to every student, then they will be able to challenge those 15 questions

 vahiin duusari taraf andaman or dubai se log likh rahe hai ki jab unke yahaan paper li nahin hua to phir dobaaraa pariksha kyon den
 One student said that he lost confidence in CBSE
 jis koching vaale ke yahaan dilli police ne chaape maare hai, uske samarthan main chaatr hi utar aae ki hamaare sar aisa nahin kar sakate
 It is the condition of our examination system that in Mumbai University too, the contract to check the copy was given to a private agency, the test was done such that the students kept on agitating for several weeks

 If it is not economic slavery then what else is there
 aap ek medical kalege main admician lete hai phir pataa chalata he ki uski fees 7 lakh se 23 lakh ho jaati he
 If you can not leave the middle education now and take a loan, then it will be out of your capacity, so now while studying in college, you will become a slave even after that the condition will be the same
 ajukeshan lone lete hai magar 7 lakh kii fees 23 lakh kar dene kaa tuk samaj nahin aayaa
 Is there this arrangement to get these students to sell and grab everything, if that is the case then it is called economic slavery because now if they want to get rid of it then they have to pay 60 lakhs to leave the college
 bahut darshakon ne kaha ki privet medical kalege he, paise waalon ke bachche padhate hai

 Some seats in private medical colleges are bought by people with money, but to say that all children are like this would be wrong
 isliye hamane kai maa baap or chaatro se poochtacha kii ki aap kis aarthik shrenee ke hai
 It turned out that all of them are students from ordinary homes who bring good numbers in NEET entrance exams
 inhone duusare privet kalege main isliye admician nahin liya kyonki vahaan 7 lakh kii fees thi or uttarakhand ke privet medical kalejon kii fees 5 lakh thi
 Many students belong to a very simple family
 unke liye ab lone lenaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 The way the fees have been increased is inhuman

 They would have known that the fees for one year would be 23 lakh, then they would not come here

 In protest, 650 students of medical colleges are sitting on a dharna

 The students are in such a bad condition that they tell them
 abhi bhi 43 seat khaali he or bahaali nahi hui he
 So we questioned many parents and students about which financial category you belong to
 pataa chalaa ki ye sab neet kii pravesh pariksha main achche number laane vaale saadhaaran gharon ke chaatr hai
 He did not take admission in other private colleges because there was a fee of 7 lakhs and the fees of private medical colleges in Uttarakhand was 5 lakhs
 bahut se chaatr behad saadhaaran parivaar ke hai
 It is now difficult for them to take loans
 jis tarah se fees badhaai gai he wo amanviya he
 It will not be easy for any ordinary family to arrange fees ranging from 30 lakh to 40 lakh within two months
 inhen pataa hota ki ek saal kii fees 23 lakh ho jaaegi to yahaan aate hi nahin
 After all, how can a government allow a private medical college to increase the 400% fee
 iske virodh main medical kalege ke 650 chaatr dharne par baithe hai
 Half of them are from Uttarakhand
 unka bhi becoground bahut saadhaaran he
 The general audience gave the first response in the same way that if they belong to private medical college then they are from rich families, so you can give 30 to 40 lakh rupees in two months
 magar ab aap samaj sakate hai ki inke saath anyaay ho rahaa he
 They are not financially capable
 20 lakh kii fees nahin de sakate hai
 You know that in Uttarakhand, the government has given permission to increase the fees to private medical colleges, due to which the fees for the first, second and third years of MBBS have been increased in such a way that you will get dizzy
 - pehle saal kii fees 6 lakh 70 hazaar se badhaakar 23 lakh kar di gai he - The fee for the second year has been increased from 7 lakh 25 thousand to 20 lakh - tisare saal kii fees 7 lakh 36 hazaar se badhkar 26 lakh kar di gai he Not only this, the students who have reached the second year will be charged the arrears of the first year i
e
 they will have to pay 40 lakh rupees
 koi bhi itani fees nahin de saktaa
 This is very big news at this time
 agar sarkaar ne is par dhyaan nahin diya to ye maa baap apane bacchon ko doctor banane ke liye barbaad ho jaaenge
 Most of them belong to ordinary families
 kaha ja rahaa he ki chaatro se halafanama liya gaya tha kalege jo fees tay karegaa deni hogi
 Everybody signs up at the time of admission but no one can think that the fee will be increased from 6 lakhs directly to 22 lakhs
 aap samaj sakate hai ki maa baap or chaatro par is vakt kya biit rahi hogi
 a mother does not understand where she will bring the fees of 41 lakhs till May 31 because both her children study there
 kai logon ko lagegaa ki yah mazaaq he, sabake paas paise hote hai bas zaraa ek baar aap khud ko inaki jagah rakhkar soch lijie, kya aap saat lakh kii jagah 23 lakh kii fees dena chahenge
 Some parents have said that even if they sell their house repeatedly, they cannot give so much money
 kya is sankat par maanav sansaadhan mantri se lekar uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri ko pahal nahin kerani chahie
 Some have even written a letter to the Prime Minister
 hamaare sahyogi dinesh mansera ne bataaya ki guru ram raay medical kalege ek bahut hi pratishthit trust se sanchalit hota he
 Guru Ram Rai was the seventh Sikh son of Guru Har Rai Ji
 unhone 1676 main apana deraa panth kaayam kiya tha
 It was named Dehradun under the name of Dera a Dun
 yahaan har saal dharmik mela lagata he
 The Education Mission of Guru Ram Rai Trust runs more than 150 Hindi and English medium schools in the name of Guru Ram Rai
 nursing kalege hai, krishi kalege hai, sanskrit kalege hai, degree kalege hai, ek hajaar bed kaa aspataal he
 There is a medical college with 150 seats
 arabon kii sampatti he
 There is no shortage of money
 phir bhi medical kalege kii fees 6 lakh 70 hazaar se badhaakar 23 lakh kar di gai he
 Dinesh says that he himself has done background checks of many children, no one can pay such a fee
 awwal to 6 lakh kii fees hi baari thi magar 23 lakh to parmaanu visphot ke samaan he
 i cannot see their status, after all, how has the government allowed to increase the fees by 400 percent
 dinesh mansera kaa kahana he ki guru ram raay medical kalege yaa trust kii taraf se koi bolne ko taiyaar nahin he
 Even then, Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna Vishwavidyalaya Vice Chancellor, who himself went to the High Court to increase the fees
 hoicourt ne kaha ki sarkaar kii gathit cameti fees kaa faisla karegi lekin cameti ke bajaae sarkaar ke cabinet ne faisla kar liya
 The case is not about one college but three private colleges
 uttarakhand kii yah fees vruddhi bhayaavah he
 Anand Rai, who fought against rigging in the medical entrance examination in Madhya Pradesh, said that there is no 20 lakh fee in his state
 pichley saal neet kii post graduate pariksha main jo prashn patr li hua tha, us maamle main bhi anand raay ne dilli hoicourt main yachikakarta hai
 Not only this, the fees of post graduates have been increased from 10 lakh to thirty lakh per year
 chaatro ke messej sunaane laguun to aap sun nahin paaenge
 Their sleep is gone
 ye sabhi middle class becoground se aate hai
 Somehow, once i took a loan that the doctors would become, but they did not know that the fees were reduced to 23 lakhs instead of 6 lakhs and 30 lakhs to 10 lakhs
 hamaara vipaksh so rahaa he, sarkarein laaparvaah ho gayi hai varna itani zyaadaati to koi nashe main bhi nahin karata
 Don't you think that injustice is being done to these students
 jaan dene kii koi zarurat nahin, magar koi laaparvaah mantri bhi is sho ko dekh rahaa he to use ek baar ke liye sochna chahie
 It should not be unfair to these students
 ye saraasar aarthik gulaami he
 The comments 18 farvari 2018 ko madhya pradesh lokseva ayog ne 200 padon ke liye pariksha lee thi jisamen 5 lakh se adhik chaatr shaamil hue the
 In this exam, there were 15 such questions which were either wrong or made two answers
 chaatro ne hangaamaa kiya to 5 prashnon ko dilit kar diya gaya he magar chaatr kehete hai ki isse unke saath ninsaphi hone kaa khatara he
 There should be a complete examination again
 hai court se ste to he magar wo kaaphi nahin he
 These students have been sitting on dharna in Bhanwarkuan area of indore for four days, on March 29, they also took a march from there to Madhya Pradesh Public Service Commission
 madhya pradesh main ek or niyam he
 If you feel that the question asked in the exam is wrong then every student will have to challenge
 chunauti dene vaale chaatr ko har sawaal ke liye 100 rupee dene honge yani is baar 1500 rupee har chaatr ko dene padenge tab jaakar ve un 15 prashnon ko chunauti de sakenge
 This model of earning from the unemployed is amazing
 bataata he ki samaaj or system main tark kii jagah hameshaa hameshaa ke liye samaapt ho gai he
 i tell a story about a job in Bihar
 4 agast 2016 ko 234 junior ejeeniyar kii vekainsee nikali
 It was a job for a one-year contract
 do saal biit gaye hai abhi tak puri bahaali nahin hui he
 This is the condition of Bihar which the leaders and the youth behind them have gone mad to ignite the riots
 chaatro kii itani haalat kharaab he ki ve kisase kahen
 There are still 43 seats vacant and no restoration
 aam darshakon ne pehali pratikriya isi tarah se di ki privet medical kalege ke hai to amir gharaanon ke hai isliye do maheene main 30 se 40 lakh rupee de sakate hai
 But now you can understand that injustice is being done to them
 ye aarthik rup se sakasham nahin hai
 Can not pay a fee of 20 lakhs
 aap jaanate hai ki uttarakhand main sarkaar ne privet medical kalege ko fees badhaane kii chhot de di he jiske kaaran embibies ke pratham, dwitiya or tritiy varsh kii fees is tarah badi he ki sunakar aap chakkar kha jaaenge
 - First year fees have been increased from 6 lakh 70 thousand to 23 lakh - duusare saal kii fees 7 lakh 25 hazaar se badhaakar 20 lakh kar di gai he - The fees for the third year has been increased from 7 lakh 36 thousand to 26 lakh yahi nahin jo chaatr duusare varsh main pahunch chuke hai unase pehle saal kii bakaayaa raashi lee jaaegi yani unhen 40 lakh rupee dene padenge
 No one can pay such a fee
 yah is vakt kii bahut badi khabar he
 If the government does not pay attention to this then these parents will be doomed to make their children a doctor
 inamen se zyaadaatar saadhaaran pariwaron ke hai
 It is being said that an affidavit was taken from the students that the college will fix the fees
 admician ke vakt har koi sin kar detaa he lekin koi yah nahin soch saktaa ki 6 lakh se sidhe badhaakar fees 22 lakh kar di jaaegi
 You can understand what will be happening on parents and students at this time
 ek maa ko samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki 31 may tak 41 lakh kii fees kahaan se laakar denge kyonki uske donon bachche vahaan padhate hai
 Many people will think that this is a joke, everyone has money, just think once you put yourself in their place, would you like to pay a fee of 23 lakh instead of seven lakh
 kuch maa baap ne kaha he ki agar ve apana ghar baar bech bhi den tab bhi itnaa paisa nahin de sakate hai
 Should not the Minister of Human Resources to the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand take initiative on this crisis
 kuch ne to pradhanmantri ko bhi patr likhaa he

 They all come from the middle class background
 kisi tarah ek baar lone le liya ki doctor to ban jaaenge magar unhen nahin pataa tha ki 6 lakh kii jagah 23 lakh or 10 lakh kii jagah 30 lakh fees ho gai
 Our opposition is sleeping, governments have become careless or else nobody gets drunk so much
 kya aapako nahin lagata ki in chaatro ke saath ninsaphi ho rahi he
 No need to die, but if a careless minister is watching this show then he should think for a time
 in chaatro ke saath ye ninsaphi nahin honi chahie
 This is sheer economic slavery
 tippaniyan On 18 February 2018, Madhya Pradesh Public Service Commission took the exam for 200 posts, in which more than 5 lakh students appeared

 If the students created a ruckus, 5 questions have been deleted, but the students say that there is a risk of injustice to them
 phir se puri pariksha honi chahie
 There is a stay from the High Court but it is not enough
 ye chaatr indore ke bhavarakuan ilaake main dharne par chaar dinon se baithe hai, 29 march ko vahaan se madhya pradesh lok seva ayog tak march bhi nikaala
 Madhya Pradesh has another rule
 agar aapako lagata he ki pariksha main poocha gaya prashn galat he to har chaatr ko chunauti deni hogi
 The challenging student will have to pay 100 rupees for every question, that is, this time 1500 rupees will have to be given to every student, then they will be able to challenge those 15 questions
 berojgaaron se kamaane kaa yah model kamaal kaa he

 bihar main ek naukari kaa kissa bataata hum
 On 4 August 2016, 234 Junior Engineer vacancies were released
 ek saal ke kantrect ke liye yah naukari thi
 Two years have passed yet complete restoration has not taken place
 ye bihar kii haalat he jise dangon main phoonk dene ke liye netaa or unke peeche yuva pagal ho gaye hai
 The students are in such a bad condition that they tell them
 abhi bhi 43 seat khaali he or bahaali nahi hui he
 - First year fees have been increased from 6 lakh 70 thousand to 23 lakh - duusare saal kii fees 7 lakh 25 hazaar se badhaakar 20 lakh kar di gai he - The fees for the third year has been increased from 7 lakh 36 thousand to 26 lakh yahi nahin jo chaatr duusare varsh main pahunch chuke hai unase pehle saal kii bakaayaa raashi lee jaaegi yani unhen 40 lakh rupee dene padenge
 No one can pay such a fee
 yah is vakt kii bahut badi khabar he
 If the government does not pay attention to this then these parents will be doomed to make their children a doctor
 inamen se zyaadaatar saadhaaran pariwaron ke hai
 It is being said that an affidavit was taken from the students that the college will fix the fees
 admician ke vakt har koi sin kar detaa he lekin koi yah nahin soch saktaa ki 6 lakh se sidhe badhaakar fees 22 lakh kar di jaaegi
 You can understand what will be happening on parents and students at this time
 ek maa ko samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki 31 may tak 41 lakh kii fees kahaan se laakar denge kyonki uske donon bachche vahaan padhate hai
 Many people will think that this is a joke, everyone has money, just think once you put yourself in their place, would you like to pay a fee of 23 lakh instead of seven lakh
 kuch maa baap ne kaha he ki agar ve apana ghar baar bech bhi den tab bhi itnaa paisa nahin de sakate hai
 Should not the Minister of Human Resources to the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand take initiative on this crisis
 kuch ne to pradhanmantri ko bhi patr likhaa he
 Our colleague Dinesh Mansera told that Guru Ram Rai Medical College is run by a very prestigious trust
 guru ram raay sikhon ke saatven ve guru har raay ji ke putr the
 He established his camp in 1676
 deraa e doon ke naam se iskaa naam dehradun padaa
 Religious fair is held here every year
 guru ram raay trust ke ajukeshan mishan ke kareeb 150 se zyaada guru ram raay ke naam se hindi or english medium skool chalate hai
 There are nursing colleges, agricultural colleges, Sanskrit colleges, degree colleges, a thousand bed hospital
 150 seat vaala medical kalege he
 There is a wealth of billions
 paise kii koi kami nahin he
 Nevertheless, the fees of the medical college has been increased from 6 lakh 70 thousand to 23 lakh
 dinesh kaa kahana he ki unhone bhi khud kai bacchon kii prishthbhumi check kii he, koi bhi itani fees nahin de saktaa
 The fee of 6 lakh was the highest, but 23 lakh is like a nuclear explosion
 mujhase inaki sthiti dekhi nahin ja rahi he, aakhir sarkaar ne kaise 400 fisadi fees badhaane kii anumati di he
 Dinesh Mansera says that no one is ready to speak on behalf of Guru Ram Rai Medical College or Trust
 saamne aae bhi to hemavathi nandan bahuguna vishvavidlaay ke vaais chancelar jo khud fees badhaane ke liye hoicourt gaye the
 The High Court said that the committee constituted by the government will decide the fees, but instead of the committee, the cabinet of the government decided
 maamla ek kalege kaa nahin balki teen privet kalege kaa he
 This fee increase of Uttarakhand is frightening
 madhya pradesh main medical pravesh pariksha main dhaandhlee ke khilaaf ladane vaale anand raay ne bataaya ki unke rajya main bhi 20 lakh fees nahin he

 Not only this, the students who have reached the second year will be charged the arrears of the first year i

 they will have to pay 40 lakh rupees
 koi bhi itani fees nahin de saktaa
 This is very big news at this time
 agar sarkaar ne is par dhyaan nahin diya to ye maa baap apane bacchon ko doctor banane ke liye barbaad ho jaaenge
 Most of them belong to ordinary families
 kaha ja rahaa he ki chaatro se halafanama liya gaya tha kalege jo fees tay karegaa deni hogi
 Everybody signs up at the time of admission but no one can think that the fee will be increased from 6 lakhs directly to 22 lakhs
 aap samaj sakate hai ki maa baap or chaatro par is vakt kya biit rahi hogi
 a mother does not understand where she will bring the fees of 41 lakhs till May 31 because both her children study there
 kai logon ko lagegaa ki yah mazaaq he, sabake paas paise hote hai bas zaraa ek baar aap khud ko inaki jagah rakhkar soch lijie, kya aap saat lakh kii jagah 23 lakh kii fees dena chahenge
 Some parents have said that even if they sell their house repeatedly, they cannot give so much money

 hamaare sahyogi dinesh mansera ne bataaya ki guru ram raay medical kalege ek bahut hi pratishthit trust se sanchalit hota he
 Guru Ram Rai was the seventh Sikh son of Guru Har Rai Ji
 unhone 1676 main apana deraa panth kaayam kiya tha
 It was named Dehradun under the name of Dera a Dun
 yahaan har saal dharmik mela lagata he
 The Education Mission of Guru Ram Rai Trust runs more than 150 Hindi and English medium schools in the name of Guru Ram Rai
 nursing kalege hai, krishi kalege hai, sanskrit kalege hai, degree kalege hai, ek hajaar bed kaa aspataal he
 There is a medical college with 150 seats
 arabon kii sampatti he
 There is no shortage of money
 phir bhi medical kalege kii fees 6 lakh 70 hazaar se badhaakar 23 lakh kar di gai he
 Dinesh says that he himself has done background checks of many children, no one can pay such a fee
 awwal to 6 lakh kii fees hi baari thi magar 23 lakh to parmaanu visphot ke samaan he
 i cannot see their status, after all, how has the government allowed to increase the fees by 400 percent
 dinesh mansera kaa kahana he ki guru ram raay medical kalege yaa trust kii taraf se koi bolne ko taiyaar nahin he
 Even then, Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna Vishwavidyalaya Vice Chancellor, who himself went to the High Court to increase the fees
 hoicourt ne kaha ki sarkaar kii gathit cameti fees kaa faisla karegi lekin cameti ke bajaae sarkaar ke cabinet ne faisla kar liya
 The case is not about one college but three private colleges
 uttarakhand kii yah fees vruddhi bhayaavah he
 Anand Rai, who fought against rigging in the medical entrance examination in Madhya Pradesh, said that there is no 20 lakh fee in his state
 pichley saal neet kii post graduate pariksha main jo prashn patr li hua tha, us maamle main bhi anand raay ne dilli hoicourt main yachikakarta hai
 Not only this, the fees of post graduates have been increased from 10 lakh to thirty lakh per year
 chaatro ke messej sunaane laguun to aap sun nahin paaenge
 Their sleep is gone
 ye sabhi middle class becoground se aate hai
 Somehow, once i took a loan that the doctors would become, but they did not know that the fees were reduced to 23 lakhs instead of 6 lakhs and 30 lakhs to 10 lakhs
 hamaara vipaksh so rahaa he, sarkarein laaparvaah ho gayi hai varna itani zyaadaati to koi nashe main bhi nahin karata
 Don't you think that injustice is being done to these students
 jaan dene kii koi zarurat nahin, magar koi laaparvaah mantri bhi is sho ko dekh rahaa he to use ek baar ke liye sochna chahie
 It should not be unfair to these students
 ye saraasar aarthik gulaami he
 The comments 18 farvari 2018 ko madhya pradesh lokseva ayog ne 200 padon ke liye pariksha lee thi jisamen 5 lakh se adhik chaatr shaamil hue the
 In this exam, there were 15 such questions which were either wrong or made two answers
 chaatro ne hangaamaa kiya to 5 prashnon ko dilit kar diya gaya he magar chaatr kehete hai ki isse unke saath ninsaphi hone kaa khatara he
 There should be a complete examination again
 hai court se ste to he magar wo kaaphi nahin he
 These students have been sitting on dharna in Bhanwarkuan area of indore for four days, on March 29, they also took a march from there to Madhya Pradesh Public Service Commission
 madhya pradesh main ek or niyam he
 If you feel that the question asked in the exam is wrong then every student will have to challenge
 chunauti dene vaale chaatr ko har sawaal ke liye 100 rupee dene honge yani is baar 1500 rupee har chaatr ko dene padenge tab jaakar ve un 15 prashnon ko chunauti de sakenge
 This model of earning from the unemployed is amazing

 4 agast 2016 ko 234 junior ejeeniyar kii vekainsee nikali

 i tell a story about a job in Bihar
 4 agast 2016 ko 234 junior ejeeniyar kii vekainsee nikali
 It was a job for a one-year contract
 do saal biit gaye hai abhi tak puri bahaali nahin hui he
 This is the condition of Bihar which the leaders and the youth behind them have gone mad to ignite the riots
 chaatro kii itani haalat kharaab he ki ve kisase kahen
 There are still 43 seats vacant and no restoration
 uttarakhand kii yah fees vruddhi bhayaavah he
 Anand Rai, who fought against rigging in the medical entrance examination in Madhya Pradesh, said that there is no 20 lakh fee in his state
 pichley saal neet kii post graduate pariksha main jo prashn patr li hua tha, us maamle main bhi anand raay ne dilli hoicourt main yachikakarta hai
 Not only this, the fees of post graduates have been increased from 10 lakh to thirty lakh per year
 chaatro ke messej sunaane laguun to aap sun nahin paaenge
 Their sleep is gone
 ye sabhi middle class becoground se aate hai
 Somehow, once i took a loan that the doctors would become, but they did not know that the fees were reduced to 23 lakhs instead of 6 lakhs and 30 lakhs to 10 lakhs
 hamaara vipaksh so rahaa he, sarkarein laaparvaah ho gayi hai varna itani zyaadaati to koi nashe main bhi nahin karata
 Don't you think that injustice is being done to these students
 jaan dene kii koi zarurat nahin, magar koi laaparvaah mantri bhi is sho ko dekh rahaa he to use ek baar ke liye sochna chahie
 It should not be unfair to these students

 It has been revealed from the report of the Ministry of Home Affairs that in the last three years more than 15,000 illegal intruders have been arrested from india-pakistan and indo-bangladesh border
 ghuspaithiyon kii sankhya par sateek jaankaree nahiloksabhaa main grih mantralay ke likhit jawaab main kaha gaya he ki bharat main bangladeshi nagarikon kiavaidh ghuspaithchintaa kaa vishay he
 In the Lok Sabha, Kiran Rijiju said that since illegal immigrants enter India without any valid travel documents
 isliye avaidh rup se rah rahe bangladeshiyon kii sankhya ke bare main koi sateek jaankaree nahin he
 Intelligence reports of Pakistani intruders, the Ministry of Home Affairs said in a written reply to illegal Pakistani nationals, "intelligence has revealed that there have been indications of more than 140 Pakistani intruders during the last three years
 '15 hajaar se adhik avaidh bangladeshi ghuspaithiye giraftaargrih mantralay ne likhit jawaab main kaha ki uplabdh soochna ke anusaar vigat teen varshon or chaalu vitt varsh ke dauraan 15 hajaar se adhik avaidh bangladeshi ghuspaithiye giraftaar kiye gaye
 At the same time, more than 1750 Bangladeshi nationals were deported from the country in these three years
 saath hi isi avadhi ke dauraan sau se adhik pakistani ghuspaithiye pakade gaye, jinamein se lagbhag 50 ghuspaithiye pakistani rangers ko saunpe gaye
 The Ministry of Home Affairs, suspected to be involved in anti-india activities, has said in the Lok Sabha that illegal immigrants are suspected that these illegal immigrants may be sensitive towards Islamic fundamentalism
 ye kaha gaya ki avaidh rup se rah rahe log ugravad or pakistan kii khufia agency ke ishaare par bharat virdohi gatividhiyon main aasaani se shaamil ho sakate hai
 Isn't the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Narendra Modi not coming together openly in this Lok Sabha election as it did in the last Lok Sabha election? Are the RSS volunteers not happy with the functioning of the Modi government? Is Modi's boat sinking without RSS support? At least this is the claim of BSP chief Mayawati
 unke rukh main achaanak bijepi or khaastaur se piem modi ke liye behad aakraamakata dikhaai de rahi he
 It has grown faster in the last one week
 aaj unhone ek nayaa pintara chalaa
 It is about the relationship between RSS and BJP
 lekin jaankaar mayawati ke daawey ko khaarij karte hai
 According to him, the thin line between the Sangh and the BJP has almost disappeared
 ab sangh khulkar bijepi ke paksh main kaam karata he
 Talking about Delhi alone, around eleven thousand volunteers made small seventy thousand meetings and created an atmosphere in favor of BJP
 sangh ke bade padaadhikari khulkar nota ke khilaaf apil kar chuke hai
 Apart from this, the Sangh also appealed to the people to vote 100 percent
 dilli main sangh ne aise parche baante jisamen modi sarkaar ke pichley paanch saal kii uplabdhiyon ko ginaya gaya
 These include national security, cultural achievements and social security issues
 bhopal main sadhvi pragna thakur ko digvijay singh ke khilaaf utaarne kaa faisla aresas kaa hi mana ja rahaa he taaki tathakthith bhagava aatankwaad par congress ko kathghare main khadaa kiya ja sake
 Senior BJP leaders are also dismissing Mayawati's claim outright
 kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh kaa kahana he ki aresas koi political sanstha nahin he, wo soshal sanstha he
 But he said it is a democratic right
 chunaav kaa parinaam aane dijie
 Everything will be known
 jinaki khud kii naiya dubi he wo khud duusare ko lekar kah rahe hai
 Mayawati had earlier attacked PM Modi personally, which was strongly condemned by all BJP leaders
 is chunaav main dabi jubaan main bispi or bijepi ke bich santh-ganth kaa aarope lagata rahaa he
 The way the Congress was kept away from the SP-BSP alliance in UP, Mayawati was also considered behind it
 lekin ab nae sameekaran banate dikh rahe hai
 In the interview to NDTV, Rahul has described Mayawati as a national symbol
 akhilesh yadav unhen pradhanmantri pad kaa daavedaar
 She herself has also hinted that after becoming Prime Minister if needed, she will contest the Lok Sabha elections from Ambedkar Nagar
 aise main bijepi or sangh ke prati unki aakraamakata anya vipakshi partiyon ko ishaara dena bhi ho saktaa he
 So the question is, is Mayawati trying to isolate BJP by dragging the Sangh ? Will Mayawati's intention to become PM be fulfilled? fifa world cap 2014 ke tahat khele gaye ek ahm mukaable main chile ne australia ko 3-1 se maat de di

 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the mother organization of the Bharatiya Janata Party, has made a shocking statement on the Aam Aadmi Party
 party ke bare main raay puche jane par sanghathan mahasachiv suresh bhaiyaji joshi ne kaha ki sangh aise kisi bhi sanghathan yaa raajnneetik dal kaa saath degaa jo bhrashtachar se ladane main sakasham he
 He said, however, it will be proved over time that who is right and who is wrong
 'bijepi nikaal legi varanasi vivaad kaa hal'sangh ne varanasi seat ko lekar bijepi main chal rahe ghamaasan par bhi raay di
 Bhaiyaji Joshi said that he was worried about the controversy in the news between Narendra Modi and Murali Manohar Joshi about the claim on the Sangh seat, but he is confident that the party will find a solution to the issue
 suresh bhaiyaji joshi ne bangalore aresas kii akhil bhartiya pratinidhi sabha kii hui teen divasiy baithak ke aakhri din patrakaron se kaha, 'ham chintit hai bhi or nahin bhi
 We feel that he (BJP) has enough experience in this regard, which we have seen many times before
 ve sakasham hai, samasya kaa samaadhaan kar lenge
 On Saturday, there was a heated debate in the bjp's Central Election Committee on the issue of candidature from Varanasi
 sutron ne kaha ki kuch sadasyon ne is babat spashtikaran kii maang kii ki kya joshi ko varanasi seat chhodani hogi or modi vahaan se chunaav ladenge
 According to the news, Joshi and senior leader Sushma Swaraj were among those who raised this subject
 jain dharm hindu dharm se alag nahinkya laalkrishna adwani jaisi varisht netaaon ko chunaav ladanaa chahie, is babat sangh kaa rukh puche jane par bhaiyaji joshi ne kaha ki sangh party ko nirdesh nahin de saktaa, keval bhaavana se avgat kara saktaa he
 He said, the party decides on these things
 agar koi vyakti apni raay vyakt karnaa chahta he to isamen kuch galat nahin he
 However, Joshi said that youth should get opportunities so that they can use their energy in the service of the nation
 iske saath hi varisht netaaon ke maargdarshan kaa bhi laabh milanaa chahie
 Regarding the grant of minority status to the Jain community, Joshi said that nothing that divides the society is acceptable to the Sangh
 joshi ne kaha, jain dharm ko hindu dharm se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The Jain sect is separated from Hinduism based on customs and religious beliefs, not culturally
 liv-in rishton or samalangikta par sangh padaadhikari ne kaha ki sangh in donon ke sakht khilaaf he
 He said, this concept is not only against Indian civilization but is dangerous for the entire human race
 is vyavastha ko sweekaar karne se samaaj main aapasi vishwaas kii bhaavana samaapt ho jaaegi
 Therefore, this anti-social system should not be accepted on any basis

 Simultaneously, Mulayam said that at that time he was also severely criticized in the House on this issue, and he was called the killer of humanity

 He said that there was a gap of poverty-richness at the time of independence but today it is more than that
 aaj ye haalat he ki log bhukh se mar rahe hai or bhukh ke kaaran log aatmahatya kar rahe hai

 a bill to increase the salary of mps manifold was passed in the last monsoon session of Parliament, but it is astonishing that no uniform pay system for legislators could be established in different states of the country even today
 gujarat ke vidhayakon ko desh main jahaan sarvaadhik 21 hajaar rupaye prati maah vetan miltaa he to vahiin kerala main ek vidhayak ko maatr 300 rupaye par guzaara karnaa padataa he
 According to the data provided by PRS Legislative Research, Gujarat is the only state in the country where mlas are paid a salary of Rs 21 thousand per month
 iske alaava vidhansabha satr ke dauraan sadan kii kaarywahi main hissaa lene par unhen pratidin 200 rupaye bhatta bhi miltaa he
 But the position of Kerala legislators is very weak in this list where they have to work with a monthly salary of only three hundred rupees
 unhen dainik bhatta bhi maatr chaar sau rupaye miltaa he
 After this, the mlas including salary and some other allowances in Himachal Pradesh will be Rs 20 thousand, in Punjab about Rs 12 thousand, in Rajasthan ten thousand rupees, in Tamil Nadu about ten thousand rupees, in Haryana about eight thousand rupees and in Delhi by five thousand rupees
 Also get low salary
 piares ne bataaya ki vetan kii tarah hi vidhayakon ko bhi saansadon ke samaan hi dainik bhatta, nirvachan kshetra bhatta, karyaalay bhatta, awaas suvidha or yatra suvidha milti he lekin vetan ke samaan hi rajyavar inamen bhi kaaphi antar he
 In the state of Haryana, mlas do not get monthly salary but they get an allowance of one thousand rupees per day, which is the highest allowance for mlas in any state
 piares se jude vidhi maamalon ke varisht visheshgyon ne bataaya ki deshbhar main vidhayakon ke vetan main koi samanta nahin he kyonki har rajya kaa apana ‘vetan bhugtan adhinium’ he jo vidhayakon ke vetan, bhatte tathaa pension aadi ke sambandh main niyam tay karata he
 Therefore, the rules regarding salary structure and allowances vary from state to state
 iske alaava vidhayakon kaa vetan badhaate samay rajya vidhansabhaayen janata kii ore se hone vaali sambhavit aalochana ko bhi dhyaan main rakhti hai
 This is the reason that in the private sector where there is a huge increase in salary every year, the salary of legislators increases once in every four to five years
 soshal media kii hai-tauba or public transport main pehle se savaar apaar bheed ke bich, dilli kii kejariwal sarkaar ne aakhirkaar apane sam-visham formule kaa puraa plan janata ke saamne rakh diya he
 Questions are also being raised on the plan and the questions are also related to the government's sudden belief in the police, which she had not considered as her part earlier
 kyonki vaayu pradooshan ke khilaaf is jang kaa puraa daaromadar dilli police par hi he
 But the big question among all this is whether everything is really bad or there are signs of an auspicious beginning in it
 yah sach bhi he or sanyog bhi ki jischin se aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ne sam-visham ke formule ko emport kiya, vahaan haal hi pradooshan kaa str 200 point jane par red alert jari kiya gaya he
 If instructions were given to keep schools and colleges closed, the movement of vehicles was also curbed
 iske ulat dilli main pradooshan kaa str 400 point ke paar pahunch chukaa he or sarkaar ne aam aadmi kii sud ab jaakar lee he
 However, one side aside from all the shortcomings and discussions is that of late the right government has taken care of the common man to whom he is genuinely responsible
 
 
 
 So is everything so bad? According to one figure, the number of private vehicles on which the government is going to implement the new rule in the national capital is 84,75,371
 yani 1 janvari 2016 se niyam ke lagu hone par somvaar se shanivaar 12 ghanton ke liye inamen se aadhi 42,37,685 gaadiyaan hi sadakon par utarane or farrate bharne ke liye adhikrut hongi
 Obviously this will trouble the public, but late in the day, a good start leads to a successful outcome
 sarkaar kaa yah formul sadakon par feet baithe iske liye janabhagidaari sabase ahm ho jaati he
 That is, we as Delhiites - you have to find those measures which will be beneficial for us as well as beneficial to the environment and friendly to the rules
 1) kool upaay he car poolingsam-visham ke ganit ko lekar ham sarkaar ke saath khadey hai yaa nahin, is charchaa main atakane kii bajaay agar dilli kaa 'gas chembar' jaisaa vaataavaran badalata he to iskaa laabh yahaan rahane vaale har naagarik ko hi milane vaala he
 In such a situation, it is better to avoid resorting to car pooling as an alternative to not getting on your car three days a week
 car pooling kaa sidhaa sa arth he ek hi raste jane vaale kisi sahyatri kii car main savaar hone kaa vikalp
 That is, if a friend of yours has an even number and you have a car of opposite number, then both of you can travel with each other three-three days a week
 behatar hoga ki apane daayre ko badhaate hue aap duusare sahakarmi yaa doston ko bhi is vikalp se jode
 This will increase friendship between each other, if four people travel together, then the distance of the floor will be reduced
 awajahi ke kharch main kami aegi or sadakon par gadiyon kii kami bhi nahin khalegi
 2) Turn to Public Transport In Delhi, public transport undoubtedly has its drawbacks
 ditisi bason se lekar metro kii bheed kisi se chhipi nahin he, lekin taatkaalik upaay ke tahat kejariwal sarkaar ne skool bason ko istemaal main laane kii bhi ijaajat di he
 This will ensure proper use of vehicles parked after bringing children to school and leaving home
 yah model canada main kaamyaab rahaa he
 This means that the relief will be partially true
 iske alaava parivahan mantri gopal raay ne ghoshnaa kii he ki dilli sarkaar 2017 tak alag-alag kishton main 7000 or bason ko sadakon par utaaregi
 While the bus and metro ride is compatible with your pocket, on many occasions it also takes you to the destination quickly by your car
 iske alaava ditisi kii bason main daily paas se lekar manthali paas or salanaa paas kii suvidha bhi sasti dar par safar kaa vikalp ban sakati he
 Even on making a metro card, you get 10% discount on daily rent
 3) cab or auto main bhi poolingsarkaar abhi yah niyam sirf privet gadiyon ke liye lekar aa rahi he
 That is, the option of taxi and auto is also open to go to office
 kai cab or auto sarvice dene vaali companiyaan iske liye nae or saste plan launch karne kii taiyaari main hai
 Apart from this, cab pooling is also available at cheaper rates
 4) kam duuri ke liye cyclingbade-bade deshon ke chote-chote shaharon se lekar chote-chote deshon ke bade-bade shaharon tak har kahin kam duuri ke liye cycle kii sawari chalan main he
 It not only fits the budget and parking problem, but is also beneficial for health
 kai deshon ke aksarparyaavaran ko dhyaan main rakhte hueek din ke liye cycle kii sawari kaa aayojan bhi kiya jaataa he
 In such a situation, if you enjoy a bicycle ride for a short distance journey
 hafte main teen din cycle kii sawari aapako feet or gym ke kharch se bhi nijaat dilaa sakati he
 5) Time saving will be due to less number of vehicles on the roads, now the people of Delhi are also likely to get rid of the problem of traffic jam
 yani ab aapako apane gantavy tak pahunchane main pehle ke mukaable kam samay lagegaa
 Simply put, you will save valuable time in daily office visits, which you can spend with friends and family
 6) paryaavaran ke prati jimmedaariin saare upayon se dilliwasi jahaan aane vaale samay main sam-visham ke formule main feet baith sakate hai, vahiin thodi si asuvidha uthaakar paryaavaran ke prati apni jimmedaari kaa nirvahan bhi kar sakate hai
 It not only guarantees you but your family a better tomorrow and better health
 bhartiya tennis ko jhakzorne vaale paanch hafte puraane sankat kaa shanivaar ko aanshik hal niklaa, jab baagi khilaadiyon ne indonesia ke khilaaf davis cap mukaable ke liye swayan ko uplabdh rakhaa
 Earlier on Friday, the All India Tennis Association (AITA) gave written assurances to the players regarding the condition of playing in the Davis Cup
 khilaadiyon ne haalanki saaf kar diya he ki yah uplabdh keval aagaamee mukaable ke liye he or yah is par nirbhar karegaa ki eitie unhen kiye gaye vaadon ko nibhaataa he yaa nahin
 The 11-member rebel group led by Somdev Devvarman, however, has refused to talk to the three-member committee set up by the AITA to resolve the issue and also want to know who will replace the non-playing captain SP Mishra in the next match
 
 sankat ko sulajhane kii disha main yah bada kadam he lekin khilaadiyon or eitie ko purv sahmati par pahunchane main ab bhi kuch samay lagegaa
 Players said in a letter to AITA that we want to confirm their availability for the Indonesia match, depending on whether AITA fulfills all the promises written in the letter unconditionally
 ham khilaadiyon ne jo mudde uthaae the unamem se kuch kaa samaadhaan abhi tak nahin niklaa he isliye hamaari uplabdhta kii pushti sirf indonesia mukaable kii he

 baatcheet kaa koi nateeja nahinduniya bhar main hindu dharm se judi dharmik kitaaben pahunchane vaali mashhuur gita press kii pahchaan or uskaa purana mukaam ab shaayad hameshaa ke liye badal jaae
 At least it seems like it is to be believed that the situation today and the trustees who run it
 darasal pichley lagbhag maheene bhar se chali aa rahi hadtaal ke chalate press band he or abhi tak karmchaariyon or trustiyon ke bich baatcheet kaa koi nateeja nahin niklaa he
 The dispute started over salary
 The issue started with the demand to increase the pay
 The matter caught more vigor when the fight erupted and workers were allegedly beaten up by a supervisor
 trust ne ise anushaasanheenata maanate hue 17 karmchaariyon ko nilambit kar diya jinamein 12 sthai or 5 asthai karmchaaree shaamil the
 Later on the conversation, Geeta Press Trust agreed to withdraw the permanent employees
 magar asthai karmchaariyon ko naukari se nikaal diya
 The staff stuck to their demand, and after ten rounds of negotiations, neither the trust was ready to withdraw them nor the employees left the condition and stubbornness of the return of those five temporary people
 tang aakar trust ke log ab puri kii puri press ko kisi or jagah shift karne par vichaar kar rahe hai
 Trustee Ishwar Prasad Patwari told that if this problem persists for a long time, books will be printed from the market first
 us par bhi or samay khinchaa to vichaar karnaa padegaa or kahin shift karne ke liye
 The option to shift is a compulsion, but the suggestion of shifting the Gita press elsewhere has created a ruckus
 logon kaa kahana he ki gita press gorakhpur kii pahchaan he or ise shahar se alag karne par is sanstha kii pahchaan hameshaa ke liye khatm ho jaaegi
 The family of Gitan Press founder Ghanshyam Das Ji Jalan is in a hurry
 teen pidiyon se gita press trust se judaa rahaa ye parivaar ab bhale hi trust se baahar ho lekin unka kahana he ki press ko gorakhpur main banaae rakhane or karmchaariyon kii vetan se judi samasyaon kaa samaadhaan karne ke liye bahut kuch kiya ja saktaa he
 The only condition is that the trustees and employees should be ready to find a way out
 vetan visangati dur hokarmchaariyon kaa tark he ki sthai karmchaariyon ko sarkari maanakon ke hisaab se bas nunatam vetan or asthai karmchaariyon ko thekedaar ke rahamokaram par kyon chhod diya jaataa he? or aakhir duniya bhar main mashhuur is trust main phaayde-nuksaan ke aankade saarvajanik kyon nahin kiye jate? gita press kii neenv rakhane vaale ghanashyam das jalaan kaa parivaar to is maamle main baqayada trustiyon par ungali uthaata he
 Watching the eleventh round of negotiations Now the case rests on the eleventh round of negotiations
 jahaan karmchaariyon or trustiyon ke bich madhyastata shram vibhaag or prashasan ke afasar kara rahe hai
 The patience of the people associated with the trust is now slowly responding, so it is quite possible that if the matter is not made in the meeting held on Friday, the trust will formally announce its decision to take Geeta Press elsewhere
 baharhaal nateeja jo bhi ho gita or duusari dharmik kitabon kaa sandesh duniya bhar main pahunchane vaali gita press ko lekar mache is ghamaasan se isse jude pathak behad aahat hai
 Some people even say that in the suppressed language, if the message that goes from here to the world takes it seriously, then the people who run the Gita press will never come here

 lekin unke baar-baar ultimatum ke baad bhi sarkaar kaa unki maangon par koi tavajjon na dena unke liye kisi bade jatke ke kam nahin mana ja rahaa he
 At the same time, given the wavering attitude of the government, now the yogurts' attitude has become sharper against the government
 ek dikkat ye bhi he ki ramdev kii agast kranti se thik pehle team anna ke andolan kaa jo anzaam hua, usase bhi unke andolan kii raunak feeki pad rahi he

 In his August movement, Ramdev, along with his original agenda to bring back black money from abroad, also added many other issues which have led to confusion among his supporters
 swami ramdev ko bhi logon kaa andolan se mohabhang hone se pehle unhen apni kranti kaa makasad or uddeshy saaf karnaa hoga

 Ayushman will benefit 40 per cent of the population at the bottom of the society
 aise main iskaa phayda garibi rekha se neeche aane vaale logon ke saath saath nikvan madhya varg ko bhi milegaa
 In preparing this, the policies implemented in countries like Sweden, Germany, Canada, America, Thailand, Japan, Korea, China etc
 were studied
 dow
 Paul was heavily influenced by Thailand's policies, where all citizens holding universal coverage health cards receive free treatment
 saath hi praathmik swasthya par sarkaar kaa bada focus he
 Dr
 paul kehete hai, "sarkaar kaa jor badi sankhya main beemaa dene ke saath buniyadi dhaanche ko viksit karne par bhi hoga
 Health and wellness centers that are set up across the country are part of that
 aspataal, doctors, nurse, para medical staff aadi kii kami ko puraa karne ke liye sarkaar lagaataar prayaas kar rahi he
 Insurance skepticism There is no doubt that this is a big step towards making India healthy
 lekin kaagajon par likhaa beemaa amal main kisi beemaari se kam jatil nahin he
 The complexity is because there are many aspects to its implementation
 masalan, labhaarthi, beemaa company, nijee aspataal, doctors aadi
 To provide insurance to 50 crore people, the major challenge before the government will be to keep costs down
 laagat badaae se beemaa companiyon kaa premium badhegaa jiskaa asar apratyaksh rup se sarkaar par hi padegaa
 The health structure in the country is similar to cumin in the camel's mouth
 maang ke saamne yah kami swasthya sevaaon ko mahangaa kar detii he
 There are also no fixed standards of treatment rates in the private sector and if government hospitals are good, why would insurance be required? badi aabaadi ko bimayushmaan skim ke antargat beemaa companiyon ko theka rajyon ke hisaab se diya jayega
 Bidding will be done for each state, in which both private and government insurance companies can participate
 rajya kii jansankhya main skim ke liye paatr logon kii sankhya ke aadhaar par premium tay hoga
 Bhaskar Nerurkar, who heads the health administration team at insurance company Bajaj Alaines, says, “an initiative from the government like Ayushman Bharat is very positive
 alag-alag rajyon main chalaai ja rahi aisi skiimon ke saath company kaa anubhav kaaphi acha rahaa he
 States like Gujarat, Mizoram and Uttarakhand are good examples of this
 ayushmaan kii nilaamee prakriya main unki company pramukhataa se hissaa legi
 Nerurkar says that this will not affect the premiums of those insured who are not covered under this scheme
 sicyor nau insurance brokar ke sansthaapak or siio kapil mehta kehete hai ki ayushmaan bharat ke kaaran beemaa kshetra main badi growth kii ummid he
 “but treating so many people on the existing infrastructure is a big challenge
 sarkari aspataalon par marijon kaa dabaav zyada he
 In such a situation, private institutions will have to participate extensively
 sarkaar ko swasthya par bajet badhaakar buniyadi dhaanche par kaam karne kii badi aavashyaktaa he
 "beneficiaries can get the benefit of this scheme only when the first aid centers are strong and the government can ensure the participation of all parties
" centre sarkaar kii chunautiyanayushmaan bharat yojana puure desh main rajyon ko saath liye bina lagu nahin kii ja sakati
 States are also partners in the expenditure on the scheme
 ayushmaan main hone vaale kharch kaa 60 fisadi hissaa centre uthaaegi, jabaki 40 fisadi hissedari rajyon kii hogi
 Whereas in states like North Eastern and hilly states like Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, the center will have 90 percent share
 ayushmaan kaa shrey centre ke hisse aayega isliye sarkaar ke saamne rajyon ko saath jodgaye kii chunauti bhi hogi
 Union Health and Family Welfare Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda says, "mous have been signed with 24 states
 rajyon se baatcheet jari he
 We are confident that all the states will be clubbed with the insurance scheme
 ''unhone yah bhi kaha ki yah bahut badi yojana he
 The technology will be fully utilized in its implementation
 iske liye ek ity solution taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he, jo agle maheene ke ant tak taiyaar ho jayega
 They say that there is no problem of budget for any health plan including Ayushman
 jaise-jaise rajya skim ko lagu karte jaaenge, jitne bajet kii jarurat hogi vah muhaiyaa karaayaa jayega
 The entire focus of the government is on providing better health facilities
 nijee aspataalon ke bina nahin chalegaayushmaan kii raah main sabase badi chunauti yah he ki nijee aspataal sarkaar kii ore se vibhinn bimariyon ke ilaaj ke liye tay kii gai daron par sahamat nahin hai
 Director General of the Association of Healthcare Providers, Dr
 giradhar je
 Says Giani, "mogul the government that treatment is possible at these rates
 sarkaar ne anumaan se ye daren tay kii hai, jin par nijee aspataal ilaaj karne ke liye taiyaar nahin hai

 '' gyaan yah bhi kehete hai ki itani badi aabaadi ke ilaaj ke liye doctors, nurse or para medical staff kii uplabdhta or maang main bada antar he
 Finance Secretary of Indian Medical Association Drs
 vinod kumaar moonga kehete hai ki is skim ke peeche sarkaar kii manshaa acchhee he, lekin iskaa kriyanvayan sabase badi chunauti he
 They say that the government's scheme is far from reality
 ilaaj kii daron par tippanee karte hue ve kehete hai ki sarkaar ne sigerian delivery ke liye 9,000 rupye tay kiye hai
 In this, how will hospitalization, operation theater expenses, surgeons, anesthesia all be possible? They say that the rates given by the government are very low
 sarkaar ko ilaaj kii daren technical tareeke se tay kerani chahie anyathaa yah skim bhi sarkaar kii anya beemaa skiimon kii tarah dam tod degi
 But Dr
 paul kehete hai ki aisa katai nahin hoga kyonki laagat ko soch-samajhakar taiyaar kiya gaya he
 "it has been prepared on the basis of CGHS rates, expert group, negotiation from 60 to 70 hospitals and studies done at cost
 lihaaja, nijee aspataalon ko kam se kam ek saal in daron ke saath aage baduya chahie
 "this is the privatization of health," says Shafila Khalil, the health program co-auditor of Oxfam India, that it is the responsibility of the government to provide free and better health facilities to the citizens of the country
 lekin badi aabaadi ko beemaa dene se nijee kshetra kii bhagidaari badhegi jo maujuuda swasthya dhaanche main asantulan paidaa kar degi
 She says that if the primary treatment centers are not rectified, patients will also depend on large private and government hospitals for diseases that were only possible at lower levels
 sarkaar ne deshbhar main 1
 a target has been set to open 5 lakh health and wellness centers but Rs 1,200 crore for this
 kaa bajet behad kam he
 Also, the budget for infrastructure care under the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was not increased by the government
 aise main praathmik upachaar ke liye bane saarvajanik swasthya centre, community centre or health sab centre kii haalat main bhi kisi sudhaar kii ummid nahin he
 Shamila says that increasing the participation of the private sector after giving an insurance plan can make health services costlier
 yah nishchit taur par premium badaae kaa kaaran bhi banegaa jiskaa asar sarkaar par padegaa
 Apart from this, the budget of Rs 2,000 crore allocated to provide insurance to 500 million people is insufficient
 sambhaavna he ki 15 agast ko yah skim lagu ho jaaegi
 But there is no guarantee that beneficiaries will get anything with the launch of the scheme
 ummid he ki 10 karod garib pariwaron ko muft beemaa dene vaali skim ayushmaan (lambii aayu) hogi
 Two major parts of the Ayushman Bharat Scheme 1 Scheme
 praathmik chikitsa ke liye 1
 5 lakhs Health and Wellness Center and National Health Protection Scheme
 2health protection skim ke tahat 10 karod garib pariwaron yani 50 karod janata ko muft swasthya beemaa dene kaa daawa
 3 The amount of insurance for each family will be Rs 5 lakh, which will cover 1,350 diseases, big and small
 4aspataal, doctors, para medical staff kii kami ke bich yojana kaa safal kriyanvayan badi chunauti

 How to identify beneficiaries? Identifying the right beneficiaries is a big challenge
 ek hi naam ke kai labhaarthi, naam kii ssailing main antar, aisi kai chijen hai jo sahi vyakti kii pahchaan main dikkat paidaa karti hai
 However a list has been passed through the states to the gram panchayats
 log khud jaan saken ki ve labhaarthi hai yaa nahin, iske liye sarkaar takanic kaa sahaara legi or skim kii lonching ke baad abhiyaan chalaaegi
 The government is also preparing a software for the correct identification of the beneficiary, which will be ready by next month
 isamen health and welnes centre kii kya bhoomika he?neshnal health protection skim kii safalataa health and welnes centre par tiki he
 These centers will be enabled to provide comprehensive health facilities
 praathmik upachaar ke saath-saath ye centre marij ke aspataal main bhartee hone se pehle or chuttee hone ke baad bhi ahm bhoomika nibhaayenge
 The stronger these centers are, the less the burden on the hospitals
 praathmik upachaar ke saath-saath in centre main telemedicine or yoga jaisi suvidhaayen bhi hongi
 How to deal with the lack of infrastructure? Certainly, health infrastructure in the country is less than the demand
 abhi ham swasthya sevaaon par jidipi ke 1 fisadi ke baraabar kharch kar rahe hai, jisebadhaakar 2
 The target is to take up to 5 per cent
 ayushmaan bharat skim kii vajah se desh main badi maang utpann hogi jo nijee aspataalon ko vistaar ke liye protsaahit karegi
 At the same time, government hospitals will also have the opportunity to build basic infrastructure because the money received from the insurance company will remain with them
 rajyon kii skiimon main is yojana kaa vilay kaise hoga?rajyon kii skiimon main beemaa kii raashi or anya sharton ko ayushmaan ke anuroop banaaya jayega
 Also, if a patient of a state goes for treatment in another state, then the state government will have to pay it
 neshnal health portability is disha main madadgaar hogi
 Ayushman Bharat is a very big project

 Salil ham apane aas-paas ye dekhte-sunate bade hue hai ki ladakiyon ko ghar ke kaamkaaj karne par dhyaan dena chahie
 Girls have to go to another's house, they are alien money, etc
 lekin kya aapane kabhi ye sochaa he ki purush bhi to usee ghar main rahete hai
 After all, what is the reason that only girls do household work
 logon ke tarkon par jaaen to ve kehete hai ki kyonki ghar ke purush kamaate hai ve baahar kaam karte hai isliye mahilaon ko hi ghar kaa kaam karnaa chahie
 But this is not the case with everyone
 jab mahilaon ko padhane ke liye bhejenge hi nahin to ve kis tarah baahar kaam karne ke yogya ho paaengi
 Secondly, even if qualified, their jobs are often rescinded after marriage
 agar naukari nahin chhudvaai to ghar or offis donon kaa kaam mahilaon ko hi karnaa padataa he
 According to the Global Trends Survey 2017, 64 percent of men still believe that women should be limited to household chores
 mahilaayein hafte main kam se kam 33 ghante tak ghar ke kaamkaaj karti hai
 Often you hear people saying that if asked, they will do the housework but this does not happen
 zyaadaatar log puche jane par jaruri kaam nipataane kaa bahaanaa karke khisak lete hai
 If you are troubled by acidity then you will get relief from these home remedies! We have to understand that women working at home also work
 unke kaam ko bhi sammaan ke saath dekhnaa chahie or jarurat padane par bina kahe haath bataana chahie
 Similarly, where domestic working women should not look at their work with inferiority complex, women working in the same job should not be proud of themselves
 pehali mulaakaat: ladakon main ye 6 chijen notice karti hai ladkiyaan!kaam he to use sabko milakar niptaana chahie
 Both husband and wife should work together quickly so that they can quickly spend quality time with each other and talk to each other in a lively manner

 He has lost his own seat
 ’it is astonishing that Rahul Gandhi has not yet resigned as Congress President
 His party performed very poorly; he lost his own pocket borough
 Both self-respect, as well as political pragmatism, demand that the Congress elect a new leader
 But perhaps the Congress has neither

 US President Barack Obama's health insurance policy, known as 'obamacare', registered 975,000 people in December
 ek varisht sarkari adhikari ke anusaar isse obamakare main panjikrut logon kii sankhya 11 lakh se upar ho gai he
 Quoting Merlin Taveners, chairwoman of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Service, Xinhua said that more than 1
1 million people have been registered in the federal government-run health plan from October 1 to December 24
 keval disambar maah main hi 975,000 log panjikrut hue hai
 The Taveners stated, "millions of Americans across the country have registered their names to take advantage of the concessional health insurance scheme
 " It is noteworthy that after the commencement of the scheme on October 1, people were not getting success in registration due to technical glitches
 rajouri sector kii bhimber gali main 4 farvari ko hui pakistani golabari main bhartiya sena ke ek captain or teen javaanon kii shahadat ne ek baar phir niyantran rekha par bigadati sthiti kii taraf dhyaan kendrit kiya he
 Ceasefire violations have increased rapidly over the years, especially since 2017
 tathy khud hi kahani bayaan karte hai
 From the time the ceasefire was implemented in 2003 to 2007, there had been 21 violations along the Line of Control (all in 2007) and three incidents along the International Border (IB)
 unamem sena ke teen log maare gaye the
 The incidence of ceasefire violations steadily increased over the next five years, ie from 2008 to 2012 and their number rose to 367 (293 on LOC and 74 on IB)
 in vaardaaton main chaar nagarikon (sabhi 2012 main) kii maut hui or suraksha balon (sena or biguef) ke 20 afasar or jawan shahid hue
 In the five years that followed, from 2013 to 2017, these incidents increased and the number reached 2,764 (1,592 LOC, 1,172 IB)
 inamen se 980 ghatnaayen (elosi 860, ibi 120) sirf 2017 main huin
 55 civilians and 61 security personnel (army and BSF) were killed in these incidents
 2018 ke maatr 36 dinon main elosi par aisi 241 ghatnaayen ho chuki hai jinamein bhartiya suraksha balon ke nau javaanon ko shahadat deni padi he
 What is the meaning of the increase in the number of ceasefire violations continuing after 2017 and now in 2018? sitambar, 2016 main sargical strike ke baad se pakistan ne is tarah kii harkaton ko badha diya he
 India thought that doing so would provide a lesson to Pakistan and would desist from cross-border violations
 apni taraf se kadaa sandesh dene ke baad lagata he, bharat ne sanyam baratna shuru kar diya tha, is ummid main ki pakistan ke ravaie main bhi badlaav aayega
 But Pakistan has taken advantage of this restraint as an opportunity
 sargical strike se mili ghaavon ko sahalaane ke baad usne phir se apni harakatein shuru kar deen, chaahe vah seemaa-paar ghuspaith kaa maamla ho yaa sangharsh viraam ulanghan kaa
 Pakistan also had a domestic factor in the violation incident on 4 February
 yah ghatnacashmirsoliderity de ke samay hui thi
 Pakistan has been celebrating Kashmir Solidarity Day on 5 February for the last 28 years
 us din pakistan main rashtriya avkaash hota he, jiskaa makasad yah sandesh dena he ki pakistan kashmiriyon ko ‘‘naitik, rajnatik or kootnithik’’ samarthan detaa rahegaa
 On this day speeches are made, processions are taken out, human chains are made, namaz is read, etc
 iske alaava is din bharat ko jamkar kosa jaataa he or tarah-tarah ke uttejk naare lagaae jate hai jaise ‘kashmir banegaa pakistan’ ‘kashmir pakistan ke gale kii nas he, ‘‘kashmir-pakistan do dil lekin ek jaan hai
 However, the thing to note in the last decade is that this day does not look as furious and warm as it used to be in the 1990s
 pakistani media main uddhrut galop ke janamat surveykshan ke mutabik, 1990 ke baad se aise logon kii sankhya main 19 pratishat kaa ijapha hua he jo maanate hai ki kashmir kabhi aaazaad nahin ho paaegaa, or aise logon kii sankhya main 14 pratishat kii giravat ai he jo maanate hai ki kashmir ek yaa do varshon main aazaadee hasil kar legaa
 Perhaps because of the fatigue caused by a long-running battle or the realization that it is an impossible task
 is thakaan kaa ek saboot kashmir soliderity de par pakistani sena pramukh general qamar javed bajva kaa vah bayaan he, jisamen unhone kaha ki kashmir ke log sanyukt raashtra ke janamat sangrah ke prastaavon ke prati antarrashtriya samudaay kii jaagrukta kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 Nawaz Sharif used the occasion to express his displeasure over the Supreme Court's decision to sack him
 ek taraf utsaah main kami or kashmir main bhartiya sena kii ore se aatankiyon kaa lagaataar safaya hone se pakistani sena kashmir mudde ko jinda rakhane ke liye duusare tareeke apana rahi he
 Pakistan is increasing tension on the loc
 elosi par sthiti bahut kharaab ho chuki he or hinsa va javaabi hinsa main ijapha hota ja rahaa he
 Now it has to be seen whether it will be limited to violations only or it can also lead to explosive situation further

 film 'saalaa khadoos' ko produs kiya he aar madhavan or rajkumaar hiraani ne or isaki nirdeshak hai, sudhaa kongra
 The story of the film is about the relationship between female boxer Madi and her coach etc
 unke ird-gird khel main faili raajnneeti or khel main ghar karti irshyaa kii bhaavana kii, jo film kaa promo dekhakar saaf ho jaataa he or promo dekhne ke baad meraa sabase bada dar yah tha ki kahin jitna promo he, utani hi film kii kahani na ho, upar se ham boxing par kai filmein pehle hi dekh chuke hai to ek sawaal man main yah bhi tha ki shaayad hi hamen is film main kuch nayaa dekhne ko mili
 But the film removed all my fears
 aapako bataa duun ki is film main aar madhavan boxing coach ke kirdaar main hai or unki shagird bani hai, ritika singh, jo real life main khud ek boxr hai
 Also in the film are Zakir, Nasser, Mumtaz Sarkar and Baljinder Kaur
 to sabase pehle baat karte hai, film kii khaamiyon kin
 First of all, there is a drawback or not, in fact, this film took a long time to arrive and in the meantime films like 'lahore', 'mary Kom' and 'brothers' have come, so some people may just box it
 Do not go to the cinema hall considering that the film is focused on, the audience may start thinking that the subject is stale
 duusari baat yah he ki film kaa pehla hissaa kahani kii neenv rakhata he, jo ho rahaa he screen par vah khaas nayaa to nahin par phir bhi aapako baandhe rakhata he
 The third drawback may be those who are boxers or who are well acquainted with the technique of the game, do not find it a boxing film or have it been filmed somewhere
 tippaniyan So this was some minor flaws and now it is about merits
 pehali baat aap boxr na hote hue bhi is film se judate hai or film aapako bhaavnaatmak safar par le jaati he
 And like i said, boxing is the center of the film, but there is more to this ring than boxing
 film kaa koi bhi hissaa sur se nahin bhatakta or yah film apni kahani or vishay ke prati eemaandaar rahati he
 The film's characters introduce strong acting
 aar madhavan apane kirdaar se 1 centimetre bhi hilte najar nahin aate, apane kirdaar par unki mehnat saaf najar aati he
 Madhavan has done a great job
 vahiin nai naveli ritika kaa bebaakapan or rones film ke liye vardaan sabit hoti he
 With full energy and honesty, Ritika succeeds in killing Madi
 film kii script, scrin-play, dialogs, becoground score, cinematographi sab vishay ko sahyog dekar use ek behtareen product banaate hai
 i would also like to praise actor Nasser here, he is an amazing actor, his role is small but how to make a character bigger, one should learn from them
 vahiin zakir apni ummid par khare utarate hai
 Overall 'sala Khadus' is a good film and don't leave it thinking that you have seen many films before on boxing
 meri taraf se 'saalaa khadoos' ko 3
 5 stars
 par film ne mere saare dar dur kar die
 Let me tell you that in this film, r Madhavan plays a boxing coach and his protagonist is Ritika Singh, who is a boxer in real life
 saath hi film main inke saath hai, zakir, naser, mumtaz sarkaar or baljinder cor
 So first, let's talk about the shortcomings of the film
 sabase pehali khami, kaami he bhi or nahin bhi, darasal, is film ko aane main kaaphi time lag gaya or is bich 'lahore', 'mairi com' or 'bros' jaisi filmein aa gayi to ho saktaa he kuch log ise sirf boxing par kendrit film samajhakar cinema haul tak na jaaen, ho saktaa he darshak yah sochane lage ki vishay basi he
 The second thing is that the first part of the film lays the foundation of the story, what is happening on the screen is not new but still keeps you tied
 teesri kaami ho saktaa he, jo boxr he yaa jo is khel kii takanic se bhalee-bhaanti parichit hai, unhen kahin lage yah banxing film nahin he yaa kahin-kahin filmi ho gai
 The comments to ye thi kuch maamuli khamia or ab baat khoobiyon kii
 First thing, despite being a boxer, you get involved with this film and the film takes you on an emotional journey
 or jaisaa maine kaha, boxing film kaa centre jarur he par is ring main or bhi bahut kuch he boxing ke alaava
 No part of the film deviates from the tone and the film remains honest with its story and theme
 film ke kirdaaron ne damdaar abhinay kaa parichay diya
 R
 Madhavan does not even move 1 centimeter from his character, his hard work is clearly seen on his character
 behtareen abhinay kiya he, madhavan ne
 On the other hand, the novelty of Ritika proves to be a boon for the film's impudence and rawness
 puri urja or eemaandaaree ke saath ritika madi ke kirdaar main jaan daalane main safal rahati hai
 The film's script, screen-play, dialogues, background scores, cinematography all support the subject and make it a great product
 main yahaan abhinayta naser kii bhi tarif karnaa chaahunga, vah kamaal ke actor hai, role unka chota he par kirdaar ko kaise bada banaaya jaataa he, unase siikhnaa chahie
 At the same time, Zakir lives up to his expectations
 kul milakar 'saalaa khadoos ek acchhee film or ise yah sochakar na choden ki boxing par aap pehle bhi kai filmein dekh chuke hai
 3 to 'sala Khadus' from my side
 5 star

 The Prime Minister of the party which ruled for many years could not do anything
 hamaari sarkaar ne takanic kaa istemaal kar is lut ko khatm kiya tha

 sena kaa ek sheersh commander galat dastavejon ke aadhaar par muft jameen paane ke aarope main ghir gaya he
 Lieutenant General Kaivalya Trivikram Parnayak is accused of acquiring land by handing over false documents to the Rajasthan government
 india today ke paas maujuud is maamle se sambandhit dastavej bataate hai le
 General Parnaik gave the domicile to the Rajasthan government to get 25 bighas of land (about 12 acres) in Mohangarh village of Jalsamer, Rajasthan
 general parnayak is samay nordaran cmand udhampur ke head hai
 General Parnaik received the War Service Medal (YSM) during Operation Parakram in 2002
 2009 main jaipur main ek galat pate ke aadhaar par jameen par adhikaar liya tha, jabaki unka parivaar kaaphi samay pehle hi rajya se baahar ja chukaa tha
 In this case, Lieutenant General Kaivalya Trivikram Parnaik while talking to India Today said that he had 'mistakenly' entered the wrong address
 yah ek galati thi
 The performance was something that i had to fill in that my family lived there
 maine yah kahana nahin chahta tha ki ve ab bhi vahaan rah rahe hai
 Parnayak said that the statement was not meant to fool anyone or to cheat anyone
 general parnayak ne kaha ki ve rajasthan ke hi rahane vaale hai or sena ke record main unka pataa chitaudgarh darj kiya gaya he
 He was shifted to House No
 3 / b / 6, Jawahar Nagar, Jaipur in 1984
 unhone bataaya ki 1972 main sena ko jwine karte samay ve rajasthan ke rahane vaale the or 2003 main jab yuddh seva medal (YSM) mila, tab bhi rajasthan ke hi the
 Attempts were made to talk to top military officials about this, but they refused to comment on the issue, saying they did not fully know the matter
 jis dastavej main general parnayak ko jameen milane kii vistrut jaankaree he, use rajya sarkaar se soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat praapt kiya gaya he
 This information was sought on behalf of the family of Subedar Major (retd) Rajendra Singh Shekhawat
 soobedaar major (ritred) rajendra singh shekhavat kii 2 july 2012 ko brain stroke ke baad military aspataal main mrityu ho gai thi
 Rajendra Singh Shekhawat's family alleges that he was being harassed since his retirement on 31 March 2012
 us par jameen aabantan ke maamle par chuppi saadhe rakhane kaa dabaav banaaya gaya tha
 Take Shekhawat

 On behalf of the army, denying these allegations, it has been said that he was under investigation in the Delhi area on charges of disturbing service records
 shekhavat ke bete pushpendra singh ke paas maujuud dastavej 2006 se lekar 2010 tak ke hai, jinamein le
 Correspondence between General Parnaik and the State Government is detailed
 isi samay ke dauraan jameen ke liye aplai kiya gaya tha or is samyavadhi main aabantan hua tha
 The address of Jawahar Nagar, given by General Parnaik, was purchased by his father TS Parnaik in the 1970s
 iske baad 2002 main unhone is ghar ko rakesh bhaatia naam ke ek bijnesaman ko bech diya tha
 General Parnaik's letter says that before receiving the award in 2003, he lived at the same address
 baad main jab jameen aabantan ko ek baar ke liye roak diya gaya to general parnayak ne jor dekar kaha ki vah or unka parivaar ab bhi vahaan rah rahe hai
 Then, on September 1, 2009, the Rajasthan Colonization Department, Bikaner, through a letter to General Parnaik, informed them that they should choose agricultural land for themselves
 yah patr usee pate par likhaa tha jo general parnayak ne 'galati se' parforma main bhar diya tha, 3 / kha, jawahar nagar
 Small but big cleverness: About a month after that, on 30 September 2009, another twist came in this case
 general parnayak ne apane hastakshron sahit ek shapath-patr (affidavit) rajya sarkaar ko saunpa
 It was also asserted in the affidavit that he and his family live in House No
3 / a / 6, Jawahar Nagar
 ek panne ke is affidavit main parnayak ne teen baar is pate kaa ullekh kiya or kaha ki yah unki apni property he
 And it was said that he and his family have no other property anywhere in the state
 iske baad march 2010 main aakhirkaar jameen le
 General Parnaik got it and its base address was 3 / a / 6
 yahaan3 / khako3 / kakar diya gaya tha
 The difference house number 3 / a / 6 of 3 / b / 6 and 3 / a / 6 is also in Jawahar Nagar
 yah 3 / kha / 6, jis general parnayak ke pita ne bech diya tha, se takreeban 200 meter kii duuri par hi he
 This two-storey house is of Dharam Chand Gera
 gera ek choti-si transport company chalaate hai
 Gera bought the place from the state government in 1974
 gera ko jab general parnayak kaa affidavit dikhaaya gaya to vah hairaan rah gaye or unhone kaha ki main general parnayak se kabhi mila tak nahin or na hi unase kabhi koi baat hui he
 When asked about this, 46-year-old businessman Rakesh Bhatia said that he bought 3 / b / 6, Jawahar Nagar in 2002 from TS Paranayak
 bhaatia ne kaha ki unka parivaar pune chalaa gaya tha or vahiin bas gaya tha
 i take the son of t s Paranayak
 general parnayak se kabhi nahin mila
 i saw him on TV after the recent incident of beheading of Indian soldiers by Pakistan Army
 revenue department ke adhikariyon se is bare main jab poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki vibhaag kii taraf se affidavit ke aadhaar par general parnayak ko jameen abantit kar di gai thi

 But the girl was kept in 24-48 hours under observation
 haalanki, bacchee ne waapas blide karnaa shuru kar diya or uski hartbeet phir se aniyamit ho gai
 The doctor tried his best to save him till 1 o'clock in the night, but could not save him

 The identity of Sri Lanka team spinner Rangana Herath is not the only end
 yah 'bujurg' gendbaaj aaj apni team ke liye strike bowler kii bhoomika main he
 Just as Muthiah Muralitharan played among the greatest spinners of all time
 herath ko nirvivaad rup se murali ke baad srilanka kaa sabase kaamyaab spinner mana ja saktaa he
 We can also count him among such bowlers in the world who, despite consistently good performance, could not get the praise he deserved
 herath kaa naam haal main us samay charchaa main aayaa tha jab unhone duniya ke sabhi test plaing deshon ke khilaaf paanch wicket lene kii durlabh uplabdhi hasil kii thi
 In this match against Zimbabwe, Herath took a total of 13 wickets (five in the first innings and eight in the second) and gave his team the victory as a captain
 srilankai cricket kii jab baat hoti he to gendbaaji ke kshetra main muralidharan or chaminda vaas kii to khub charchaa hoti he lekin herath ko akasar nazarandaaj hi kar diya jaataa he
 The special thing is that like Murali, there is no tag of 'chakar' on Herath
 murali bhale hi spin ke 'jaadugar' rahe lekin australia main unki gendon ko chaking ke aarope ke kaaran no ball ghoshit kiye jane, boometric test se guzarane or bishan singh bedi jaise diggaj spinner ke 'jaevlin throre' ke sambodhan ke kaaran unke khel kaushal kii chamak malin jarur padi
 Luckily for Herath, the action is absolutely clean
 is 38 varshiya srilankai gendbaaj kaa ausat or strike rate kamaal kaa he
 Herath has made 27 of 75 Test matches so far
 97 ke ausat se 351 wicket (iconomi rate 2
 76)
 unka strike rate 60
 He has managed to take wickets in almost every 61 balls
 unke in aankadon kii agar murali se tulana karen to murali kaa test kariyar strike rate 55
 0, economy rate 2
 47 or ausat 22
 Is 72
 murali ne 133 test main 800 wicket hasil kiye the
 The comments baayen haath ke leg spinner herath ko lagaataar kasi hui gendbaaji or lambey spel phenkane ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Herath, who made his Test career debut in 1999, met the legendary Murali in his first match
 yahi nahin, australia ke khilaaf gaale main hue is test main unhone murali ke saath hi australian pari ko sametane main bhoomika nibhaai thi
 In this draw, Murali took five for 71 and Herath took four wickets for 97 runs
 herath ke bare main yah jarur kaha ja saktaa he ki unhone apane adhiktar wicket gharelu-madadgaar pichon par hi hasil kiye hai
 At home ground where he scored 23 in 41 tests
 14 ke ausat se 231 wicket liye hai vahiin videsh main khele gaye 34 test main 120 wicket liye hai, isamen neutral vaineu par hasil kiye gaye 24 wicket bhi shaamil hai
 He averages around 37 in foreign plains
 herath jald hi srilanka ke duusare sabase kaamyaab gendbaaj ban jaaenge
 He is just four wickets behind from paceman Chaminda Vaas's record of 355 Test wickets
 is baat ko dhyaan rakhana hoga ki vaas ne 111 test main ye wicket hasil kiye the jabaki herath mahaj 75 test main hi unke record se mahaj chaar wicket kii duuri par hai
 If 38-year-old Herath continues his performance, the figure of his wickets can cross 400
 
 Herath can unquestionably be considered Sri Lanka's most successful spinner after Murali
 unki ginati ham duniya ke aise gendbaajon main bhi kar sakate hai jo lagaataar achche pradarshan ke baavjood vah prashansa nahin paa sakaa jiskaa ki vah hakdaar tha
 Herath's name recently came up for discussion when he achieved the rare feat of taking five wickets against all the test playing nations of the world
 zimbabwe ke khilaaf is match main herath ne kul 13 wicket (pehali pari main paanch or duusari main aath wicket ) jatke or captain ke rup main apni team ko jeet kaa tohfa diya
 When it comes to Sri Lankan cricket, there is a lot of discussion about Muralitharan and Chaminda Vaas in the field of bowling but Herath is often ignored
 khaas baat yah he ki murali kii tarah herath par 'chakar' kaa koi tag bhi nahin laga he
 Murali may have been a 'wizard' of the spin but his playing skills in Australia were declared a no-ball due to the charge of chucking his balls, passing biometric tests and the 'javelin thrower' address of the legendary spinner like Bishan Singh Bedi
 There was a slight glow saubhaahgya se herath ko ection ekadam clin he
 The average and strike rate of this 38-year-old Sri Lankan bowler is amazing
 herath ne ab tak 75 test maichon main 27
 351 wickets at an average of 97 (economy rate 2
 76 )hasil kiye hai
 His strike rate is 60
 7 kaa he yani lagbhag har 61 gend main ve wicket lene main kaamyaab rahe hai
 If we compare these figures with Murali, Murali's test career strike rate is 55
 0, iconomi rate 2
 47 and average 22
 72 kaa he
 Murali had taken 800 wickets in 133 Tests
 tippaniyan Herath, a left-arm leg-spinner, is known for consistently bowling and throwing long spells
 1999 main apane test kariyar kaa aagaaj karne vaale herath ko apane pehle hi match main mahaan murali ke saath mila
 Not only this, he played a role in the Australian innings with Murali in this test against Australia in Galle
 drow rahe is match main murali ne 71 ran dekar paanch or herath ne 97 ran dekar chaar wicket liye the
 It can be said about Herath that he has taken most of his wickets on home-friendly pitches
 gharelu maidan main jahaan unhone 41 test main 23
 He has taken 231 wickets at an average of 14 while in the 34 Tests played abroad, he has taken 120 wickets, including 24 wickets taken at the neutral venue
 videshi maidaanon main unka ausat 37 ke aasapaas kaa he
 Herath will soon become Sri Lanka's second most successful bowler
 tej gendbaaj chaminda vaas ke 355 test wicket ke record se ve mahaj chaar wicket hi peeche hai
 It has to be kept in mind that Vaas had taken these wickets in 111 Tests while Herath is just four wickets away from his record in only 75 Tests
 38 saal ke herath ne yadi aisa hi pradarshan jari rakhaa to apane viketon kaa aankada 400 ke paar pahunchaa sakate hai
