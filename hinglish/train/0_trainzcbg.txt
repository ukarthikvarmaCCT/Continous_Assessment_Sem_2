 vahiin lalu yadav ke raajnneetik uttaradhikari or vipaksh ke netaa tejasvi yadav se jab is sambandh main poocha gaya to unka kahana tha koun kya bolta he unhen usase koi matlab nahin
 Whether it is the candidate of Deputy Pataliputra or any other parliamentary constituency, it will be decided by the party supremo Lalu ji
 tejasvi ke bayaan se saafe he ki wo tej pratap ke bayaan se ittefaaq nahin rakhte hai or saath hi saath bhai virendra jaise party ke varisht vidhayakon ko bhi wo apane saath rakhana chaahate hai
 Other senior leaders of the party say that Tej Pratap wants to be in the media headlines every day by making ul-jul statements and he wants to come to the rjd's power center
 magar party main unhen koi gambhirtha se nahin letaa
 Let us know that the Pataliputra Lok Sabha seat, formed in 2008 after delimitation, is seen as a prestige for the rjd's 'first family', as both Lalu Prasad and his daughter contested from here and both did not succeed
 rajd adhyaksh 2009 main ek samay apane kareebi rahe ranjan yadav se yahaan se chunaav haar gaye the

 Ramkripal was also very close to Lalu at one time

 The court will give its verdict on Tuesday on the Indian couple arrested in Norway for child abuse
 andhra pradesh ke software visheshgy chandrashekhar vallabhnei or unki patni anupama ko apane bete ke saath bura saluk karne ke aapraadhik aarope main 28 november ko hiraasat main bheja gaya tha
 Earlier, India took the stand to wait in Norway and said that the Norwegian Embassy will do whatever it deems appropriate in the case of alleged child molestation
 haalanki, yah spasht kar diya ki ghatana ek privet naagarik or sthaneey kanoon se judi hui he
 Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid said, 'this is an issue which is not connected with the government
 yah ek privet naagarik or us desh ke kanoon se judaa maamla he
 The comments vahiin hyderabad se mili khabar ke mutabik, is dampati ke parivaar ne kaha ki norge main vallabhnei or anupama par lagaae gaye aarope jhuthe hai
 The couple is alleged to have alleged that when their seven-year-old son wet his pants in the school bus and told his father about it, his father threatened to send him to India if he did it again Will go
 isse purv bharat ne norge maamle main intjaar karne kaa rukh akhriyaar karte hue kaha ki kathith bal pratadna ke maamle main norge duutavas ko jo kuch uchit lagegaa, vah karegaa
 However, it made it clear that the incident is linked to a private citizen and local law
 videsh mantri salmaan khurshid ne kaha, ‘yah ek aisa mudda he jo sarkaar se judaa hua nahin he
 It is a matter related to a private citizen and the law of that country
 tippaniyan At the same time, according to the news from Hyderabad, the couple's family said that the allegations against Vallabhnei and Anupama in Norway are false
 gauratlab he ki dampati par aarope lagaaya gaya he ki saat varshiya unke bete ne jab skool bas main apni pant geeli kar lee or apane pita ko is bare main bataaya, tab uske pita ne dhamkee di ki yadi usne dobaaraa aisa kiya to use bharat bhej diya jayega

 Even though we are claiming ourselves to be the most progressive country in the world in the 21st century
 mangal grah par yaan bhejne kii baaten kar rahe hon, lekin jamini str par paristhitiyaan aaj bhi badi bhayaavah hai
 People belonging to Dalit society are still considered worse than animals
 is sabhi ke baavjood is samaaj se nikle yuva safalataa kii nai ibaaratein likh rahe hai
 Some are topping UPSC and some own more than 20 companies today
 ji haa, yahaan ham aapako bataa rahe hai andhrapadesh ke prakasham jile main paidaa hue madhusudan raav ke bare main jinke sangharsh or jazbe ke kisse aaj logon ke liye preranastrot hai
 Father was a bonded laborer, he is the owner of companies
 
 
 madhusudan ke pita kisi jamaane main bandhua mazdooree kiya karte the
 In return, he used to get only food from the zamindar
 kai baar kaam par na jane kii haalat main bhookha bhi sona padataa tha
 He says that his shadow was also considered bad because of belonging to Dalit society
 ve in bhayaavah paristhitiyon main bhi date rahe or padhai jari rakhi
 Somehow 12th pass and wanted to get a job and got a polytechnic
 polytechnic karne ke baad nahin mili naukari, kerani padi mazdooree
 
 
 The intention behind his polytechnic was that he should get a job as soon as possible, but regret that references were sought everywhere from him
 unke ghar ke sadasyon kii shiksha kaa hawala dekar unhennaukari se doorrkha jaataa
 Eventually, he got frustrated and started working with his brother
 iske alaava ve chaukeedaari kaa bhi kaam kiya karte the taaki overtime kaam karke ve ghar waalon kaa kharchaa chalaa saken
 The village was not used to shame, now the whole village takes its name
 
 
 gaanv or shahar main yahi to basic fark he
 People raised in the village always want to return to the village
 ho saktaa he ki kai baar ve shuruatidikkatonse do-chaar hon lekin ve jarur waapas lautnaa chaahate hai
 Madhusudan is also a person of some similar mood
 ve lagaataar safal hone ke liye sangharsh karte rahe or is kram main ve kai baar dhokhe ke bhi shikaar hue
 Once they were completely empty
 unhone jinke saath mil kar company kholi thi ve sara phayda lekar chanpat ho gaye
 He did not give up, today runs 20 companies with the family
 
 
 alag-alag logon ke saath kaam karne kii vajah se ve is baat ko samaj chuke the ki chuninda logon par hi vishwaas kiya janaa chahie
 He works for 18 hours a day and lives together like his wife Hameshaparachai
 ve aaj MMR Groups ke sansthaapak hai or iske antargat 20 se adhik companiyaan aati hai
 He considers his parents as his ideal and remembers him in every dilemma
 ve aaj hajaaron yuvaaon ko rojgaar dene kaa kaam kar rahe hai or bharat desh ke pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi unki pratibha or jazbe ke mureed hai
 Veteran leader and former President Pranab Mukherjee, who is a Congress tradition, will participate in a program of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh this evening
 iske liye wo nagpur pahunch chuke hai
 Pranab Mukherjee's move triggered a political stir
 congress ke tamaam netaa is daure ke virodh main bol rahe hai
 Even Pranab Mukherjee's daughter Sharmistha Mukherjee has given strict advice to her father
 kya he sangh?sabase pehle baat sangh kii
 Right in the dark nights of slavery, but on Vijayadashami in 1925, an organization was formed which claimed to distance itself from politics
 lekin ye bhi sach he ki aaj desh kii raajnneeti ke saare bade raste uski shakhaon kii galiyon se hote hue uske mukhyalay par khatm ho jate hai
 That organization is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 kyon machaa he hangaamasang kaa vaada hindutv kii rahanumai kaa he
 The Sangh claims to belong to the Hindu nation
 sangh kaa iraadaa akhand bharat kaa he
 The Sangh's thinking deviates from the pages of cultural nationalism, but a section of secularism advocates also narrows the eyebrow
 isiilie jab congressi parampara main paley-bade, nehru-indira ke mulyon or manyataon kii chhaanv main raajnneeti seekhney vaale or dharmanirpekshata ke taane-bane main bhartiya samaaj ko bunane vaale purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne sangh ke ek kaarykram main mukhya atithi banane kaa nyotaa kabool kiya to hangaamaa much gaya
 All eyes on Nagpur this evening, the third year education class closing ceremony of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh to be held at Resham Bagh ground in Nagpur
 usamen naa sirf purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee shariq ho rahe hai, mukhya atithi ban rahe hai balki wo aresas ke passing out kaarykram main bhi shaamil honge or apana vichaar rakhenge
 Everyone's eyes will be on Nagpur this evening
 sangh ne apni taraf se puri taiyaari kar rakhi he
 Amidst opposition and support, it is certain that Pranab Mukherjee will go to the Sangh program and only then will it be known what is in Dada's heart
 ye sawaal uth rahesawaal uth rahe hai ki kya pranab mukherjee rashtrawaad par apane vichaar rakhenge? agar rakhenge to wo sangh kaa rashtrawaad hoga yaa nehru kaa, jinaki raajnneeti ke hami khud pranab mukherjee taumr bane rahe? kya unke vichaar aresas ke rashtrawaad ke vichaaron se mail khaaenge? kya wo hindu raashtra ke sawaal par bhi apni aapattiyon ko rakh sakate hai? kya pranab mukherjee sarv dharm sambhaav kii us parampara kii yaad dilaayenge jo gandhi ke raajnneetik chintan se nikali he yaa phir sangh ke vichaaron se milti-julati raay prastut karenge? kya bharat kii bahulata or vividhta vaali samskruti kii pairokari karenge, jo bharat kii asli pahchaan he?raashtrapati banane ke baad pranab kaa dikhaa nayaa cheharawaise mana ja rahaa he ki pranab mukherjee bhale hi jindagi bhar congress ke rang main range rahe, lekin raashtrapati banane ke baad unka ek nayaa cheharaa saamne aayaa
 Completely bound by the values of the Constitution
 raashtrapati ke rup main pranab mukherjee se aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat kii raashtrapati bhawan main hi kai baar mulaakaat hui
 Even after leaving the post, Pranab Mukherjee called Bhagwat for dinner
 vastav main pranab mukherjee kii raajnneetik shakhsiyat itani badi rahi he ki khud pradhanmantri narendra modi unako pitatulya maanate hai
 It may be a success for the RSS that a big political figure who has questioned the views of the RSS throughout his life is the chief guest in his house today
 isse sangh ko lagata he ki uski vichaardhaara ko majbootee milegi
 The daughter also gave Pranab the advice
 Former President Pranab Mukherjee reached Nagpur and there was a news that BJP may field his daughter Sharmishtha Mukherjee from Malda in West Bengal
 is khabar ko lekar sharmishtha ne tabadatod do twit kiye
 Attacking BJP and RSS, he even gave his father the advice
 aresas ne aisi raajnneetik shakhsiyat ko kyon bulayapanch saal tak desh ke pratham naagarik rahe pranab mukherjee kii pahchaan congressi vichaardhaara main rache based ek aise rajaneta kii he jinhone bharat kii dharmanirpekshata or loktantric mulyon kii duhai har manch par di
 In such a situation, the question is why the RSS called a political figure whose ideology does not match the Sangh at all
 iskaa ek jawaab to ye he ki sangh ne aise tamaam logon ko pehle bhi apane kaaryakramon main bulaayaa he jinamein republican party of india ke netaa or dalit chintak dadasaheb ramakrishna suryabhaan gawai or vampanthi vichaaron vaale krishna ayyar jaise log shaamil hai
 Moreover, in every fight against the Congress, the RSS supported the leaders of the Congress
 kya soch-samajhakar sangh ne pranab ko chunaa!1975 main immergency ke dauraan aresas puri tarah jepi andolan main kud padaa
 Even when the Janata Party government was formed in 1977, the name of former Congress Murarji Desai was also agreed in the Sangh
 1989 main jab rajeev gandhi ke khilaaf vipakshi ekta ke nayak banakar veepi singh ubhare to sangh ke saae main bijepi bhi unke saath khadi thi
 So, to fight the Congress, the Sangh has now chosen as Pranab Mukherjee a leader whose great Congress legacy will be cut by the Congress
 sangh ne shuru se alag rasta akhriyaar kiya1925 main aresas kaa gathan hua tha
 After that the RSS neither became a participant in the Gandhi-led movement nor was it a partner in the movement of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, who came out of the Congress
 or naa hi kabhi bhagat singh or chandrashekhar aaazaad jaise krantikariyon se uskaa vaasta rahaa
 Neither did the RSS appear during the Quit India Movement of 1942
 balki aazaadee ke vakt to sangh ne tirange kaa virodh tak kiya tha
 The national flag has also opposed the RSS mouthpiece The Organization wrote in an editorial on 17 July 1947 called National Flag that the saffron flag should be considered as the national flag of India
 22 july 1947 ko jab tirange ko rashtriya dhvaj mana gaya to da orgenigeshan ne hi iskaa jamkar virodh kiya
 But it is also true that in independent India, the role of RSS gradually increased
 yahaan tak ki aresas ke dhur virodhiyon ne bhi use jagah dena shuru kiya
 At one time, Nehru had also become the rss's murid RSS gradually made its identity a disciplined and nationalist organization
 1962 main china ke dhokhe se kiye hamale se desh sann rah gaya tha
 At that time, the RSS had helped deliver logistics to the border areas
 isse prabhavit hokar pradhanmantri nehru ne 1963 main ganatantr diwas ke parade main sangh ko bulaayaa tha
 During the 1965 war with Pakistan, the Sangh helped improve the traffic system in Delhi
 1977 main aresas ne purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi ko vivekanand rock memorial kaa udghaatan karne ke liye bulaayaa tha
 When Jayaprakash Narayan took the help of RSS while forming Janata Party, he said that if Jana Sangh is fascist then i am also fascist
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kaa ek itihaas rahaa he
 a link in that history also connects with Mahatma Gandhi
 gandhi jindagi main bas ek hi baar sangh ke kaarykram main gaye or vahaan bhi vahi kaha jo unke dil main tha
 Now it's Pranab Mukherjee's turn
 teen baar lag chuki he sangh par pabandisangh par ab tak teen baar pabandi lag chuki he
 The Sangh was first banned in February 1948 when Gandhi was assassinated by the Hindu fundamentalist Nathuram Godse
 sangh par wo pabandi july 1949 tak rahi
 During the second Emergency, the Union was banned from 1975 to 1977
 or teesri baar chah maheene ke liye 1992 ke disambar main lagi, jab 6 disambar ko ayodhya main babari masjid gira di gai
 Gandhi had rejected the Hindutva of the Sangh, in the moving towards independence, on the one hand there was Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation, on the one hand, MS Golwalkar, the Sarsanghchalak of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 aresas ke prati gandhi kii raay kisi se chuphi nahin thi
 Nevertheless, on 16 September 1947, Gandhiji went to a branch of Bhangi Basti at the invitation of Vasantrao Oak, the Delhi province pracharak of RSS
 pehali or aakhri baar
 There Gandhi made it clear that he did not believe in the Hindutva of the Sangh
 sangh par farvari 1948 main pehali baar tab pratibandh laga, jab hindu kattarpanthi nathuram godse ne gandhi kii hatyakar di
 That ban on the Sangh remained until July 1949
 kabhi pranab ne bhi lagaae the sangh par sangeen aropakentre main mantri rahete khud pranab mukherjee ne sangh par sangeen aarope lagaae the
 By the way, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who today considers the BJP and the Sangh to be his icon, also said in the shadow of Gandhi's assassination on July 18, 1948 that the activities of the RSS were risky for the survival of the government and the state
 reports bataati hai ki aisi gatividhiyaan band hone ke baavjood khatm nahin huin
 The organization of RSS has been disobeying over time
 unki vidrohi gatividhiyaan badhati ja rahi hai
 So, going from Gandhi to Patel, today, Pranab Mukherjee left the Congress in front of the Sangh and reached the post of President
 nagpur main sangh ke kaarykram main wo bolenge to unke saamne itihaas kii wo dharohar bhi hogi, jisko sanjokar unki raajnneeti fali phuli

 Shankaracharya said in a conference convened at the Paramhansi Ganga Ashram on Friday that 'PK' had an objectionable filming of the gods and goddesses
 aakhirkaar dharm nirpekshata kii baat hinduon ke liye hi kyon kii jaati he anya dharmon ke liye kyon nahin
 Shankaracharya has said that insulting Hindu deities will not be tolerated under any circumstances
 hindu devi devataaon ko mannoranjan kaa paatr kyon banayashankaracharya swami swaroopanand saraswati ne kaha ki sensor board aakhir aisi filmon ko certificate kaise jari kar detaa he, film banane vaale bhi hindu devi-devataaon par film banane se pehle dharmaguru yaa vishay ke achche jaankaron se jaankaree na lekar kuch bhi kyon dikhaate hai
 Shankaracharya said that the most important thing is that why do the Hindu gods and goddesses of these films only make them eligible for entertainment
 karodon logon kii aasthaa ko manoranjan kaa paatr bananaa ab bardaasht nahin kiya jayega
 Shankaracharya asked why the film is not made on other religions like Muslim, Christian etc
 kyonki film banane waalon kii anya dharmon par film banane kii himmat nahin he, jo film hindu devi-devataaon kaa apmaan karegi uskaa virodh kiya janaa chahie, aisi filmon ko sahan nahin kiya jayega

 darasal, saamaajik sarokaaron se judi, hansi se lotpot karti mistar parfectionist aamir kii is film main bhagwaan shankar ke vesh main ek baharupie ko dikhaaya gaya he

 Viewers are watching the film without loosening their pockets without distinguishing caste-religion
 aise main sawaal he ki ek film ko dharm ke taraazoo par rakhkar tolana kitna munasib he
 If there is objection about a scene, then why did the audience not reject it

 Watching the trailer, it felt like Kapil is watching the same comedy show on the big screen because the trailer saw the same small jokes and similar comedies as we have seen on TV
 saath hi ye bhi mahasoos hua kii thriller banane vaale nirdeshak abbaas mastaan ne bhi kapil kii kamyaabi ko dekhte hue apana rasta kamedi kii taraf mode liya or film bana daali 'kis kisko pyaar karun
 Comments trailor release ke mauqe par kapil ne kaha ki "is film kii sabase badi mistry he ki abbaas mastaan kamedi bana rahe hai"
 At the same time, Abbas Mastan said that "2 years ago the script came out, then i was waiting for the actor to play this role properly
" uske baad jab kapil kaa sho dekhne lage to ehsaas hua ki ab film banani chahie
 " vaise is film ko kamedi sho kii tarah hone kii vajah ye bhi ho sakati he ki is film ke lekhak anukalp sharma kamedi sho likhte hai kapil ke liye
 The first trailer of Kapil's first film 'kis Kisko Pyaar Karun' was released in Mumbai where the entire team of the film was present
 yahaan kaa maahaul bhi hansi mazaaq se bharaa tha or baat baat par kapil kamedi kar rahe the
 And the same comedy was also seen in the trailer of Kapil's film
 trailor dekhakar aisa laga jaise kapil kaa vahi kamedi sho bade parade par dekh rahe hai kyonki trailor main vaise hi chote-chote chutkule or waisi hi kamedi dekhne ko mili jaisi ham tivi par dekhte aaye hai
 At the same time, it was felt that director Abbas Mastan, who made the thriller, also turned his way towards comedy, seeing the success of Kapil and made the film 'kis Kis Ko Pyaar Koonoon'

 The truth is that China has not retreated as much as it entered the Indian border
 china 19 kilometre tak bhartiya seemaa main ghusaa tha or peeche hatane ke naam par vah kuch hi kilometre waapas gaya he
 After all, the cleverness of China struck us
 na hamaari videsh niti kaam ai, na kootneeti or na raksha niti
 We kept seeing the spectacle of defeat on every front, and the traitors of China
 ladakh kii seemaa se 19 kilometre tak andar ghus aae china ne 21 din baad apana boria bistar sameta bhi to beyimaani kar di
 The Government of India showed as if all the quarrel with China had been resolved
 lekin ab pataa chalaa he ki iske evaz main hamen badi qeemat chukaani padi he
 In return for the retreat, the People's Liberation Army of China had made a condition that they remove their permanent outpost from Chumar
 bharat main badhate dabaav ko dekhte hue sarkaar ko is shart par fokat main haa kerani padi
 And what did you get in return? Chinese troops, who had entered the Indian border for 19 km, slipped 2 km behind
 salmaan khurshid to aise kah rahe the jaise desh par ehsaan kiya ho
 The truth is that the country has paid the price for Salman's visit to China on the 9th
 lekin desh ko unhone china kii hoshiyaaron kii taraf se andhere main rakhaa
 Why kept India in the dark? The country felt that the government had done the trickery of China
 hamen kya pataa tha ki ye nae dard kaa sabab ban jayega
 India did not do anything in front of China's tricks
 ham zyaada peeche hatechin kaa lollypop khaakar hindustan laharaa gaya
 He retreated two kilometers and moved back further than us
 chaowkee ganvaai so alag
 And could not even take the promise that China would restore the situation before April 15
 agar china ke saamne hathiyaar daalane kii khabar afvaah he to phir sarkaar yahi kyon nahin bataa detii kii sach kya he
 What is our agreement with China and whether we have lost the outpost of Chumar? The government will not speak when the truth is in its favor
 or philhal to sach ye he ki china ke saath baat karte hue sharten sirf wo tay kar rahaa he or ham uski dayaa or krupa ke bharose hai
 And the history of the world says that the cleavage of the relationship between the two countries has not been filled till date
 sutara bataate hai ki ladakh se china hataa jarur he, lekin yun hi nahin, vah kuch lekar hataa he
 One, in persuading China to move away from the Indian border, India had to agree to remove its strategic post from a strategic point of view
 vahiin, khabar yah bhi he ki chini palaton ke 50 sainikon ke mukaable itibipi ke 30 sainik hi apni puraani pojishan par tainaat hai
 To put it simply, China has pushed Indian troops back into its own border
 aise hi peeche nahin hataa chinaravivaar shaam ko khabar ai thi ki vivaad sulajh gaya he or china bhartiya seemaa se hatane par raji ho gaya he
 However, it is now reported that China did not give up its stubbornness, but in persuading it, India had to agree to remove the strategically important post
 20 din baad chini fouj bhartiya seemaa ke 19 kilometre bheetar purvi ladakh ke daulat beg oldy se hatane ko raji ho gai lekin, china se jhagada sulajhane se desh main jitani khushi he, utani hi chintaaen bhi hai
 Questions are arising that how did the stubborn China agree? Omar Abdullah also raised doubts
 Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah also expressed his concern on Monday, saying, 'the only doubt is that the media reports said that both The sides retreated
 bharat or china peeche hate
 i am amazed about where India was removed and where India was to move because it is our region, it is our region of the Line of Actual Control

 During Trump's meeting with Pope Francis on Wednesday, Melania Trump wore a black long-sleeved dress
 saath hi unhone apana sar bhi dhaka hua tha
 Let us know that earlier many women also wore such clothes during the meeting with the Pope
 miting ke dauraan trump kii beti, ivanka trump sahit upasthit anya mahilaon ne bhi isi tarah ke kapade pahane huai the
 Also, black cloth was covered on the head
 ye thodi chaukaaney vaali baat he ki vatican main melania ne apana sar dhaka jabaki isse pehle jab vomuslim desh saudi arab gaito unhone scorf nahin pahana
 Such questions are arising on social media as to why they did this
 unki pravaktaa ne steffni grisham ne ek email main likhaa ki melania vatican protocol ko follow kar rahi thi
 All the women in the meeting wore long-sleeved black dresses and scarves to cover their heads
 saudi main uski jarurat nahin thi to unhone nahin pahana
 In the past, many women did not wear the scarf, when Queen Elizabeth II first visited the Vatican, she wore a scarf and black dress several times under her crown
 lekin 2014 ke daure main, unhone ek parapal dress or topi pahenti thi
 Michelle Obama wore a blue dress when she met the Pope in 2015 at the airport in Washington, DC
 saudi arab main, muslim mahilaon ko scorf pahananaa jaruri hota he, lekin videshiyon ko us dress code kaa paalan karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Some prominent women have worn scarves for official visits to Saudi Arabia and some have not
 melania trump kii tarah, isse pehle gai hillari clinton or laura bush ne bhi scorf pahane bina desh kaa daura kiya
 Melania's visit was not religious
 Jane Hampton Cook said that Melania Trump had not worn a scarf during her tour of Saudi, but that she had fully clothed hands and feet
 melania kii yatra dharmik netaaon yaa mandir ke liye nahin thi
 He said that women in Saudi are dressed in head covering
 jabaki duniya main aisi bahut muslim mahilaayein he jo aisa nahin karti
 Mitchell's head was criticized when he refused to cover it during Michelle Obama's 2015 visit when it was called a bold political statement
 us samay, raashtrapati donald trump ne twit karke mishael ke faisle kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki, bahut se log yah kah rahe hai ki shrimati obama ne saudi arab main ek dupatta pahanane se manaa kar diya, yah unka apmaan tha
 Hatay Hijab CEO Melanie Eltark has said that the scarf has been misunderstood by different people and has been made a more political issue
 ise galat tareeke se pesh kiya gaya he
 Let me tell you that this week when Trump visited Weserton Wall in Israel
 jo ki sabase pavitra sthal mana jaataa he
 Here, Jews pray
 vahaan evenka trump ne prarthana karte samay thodaa sa sar dhaka tha, jabaki melania trump sir par kuch nahin pahana tha

 desh bhar main kai train haadase hone ke baavjood railway prashasan kii laaparvaahee rukne kaa naam nahin le rahi he
 Railway officials neither care about the safety and convenience of the passengers nor realize their responsibility
 ab ek aisa karnama saamne aayaa he, jisane sabko hairaan kar diya he
 The train, which left Delhi for Maharashtra, reached Madhya Pradesh due to a mistake by the railway administration
 yah train 160 kimi tak galat disha main daudti rahi, lekin na to railway prashasan ko isaki jaankaree hui or na hi driver ko
 When the train reached Banmore station in Madhya Pradesh, the driver sensed that the train was going on the wrong route
 ganimat rahi ki is dauraan koi bada haadasa nahin hua
 Hundreds of passengers had to bear the brunt of this negligence of the Kisan Railway Administration, returning to Maharashtra after participating in the Kisan Yatra rally
 ye yatri banmor stesan main funs gaye
 Now the railway officials do not know what to do? In fact, hundreds of farmers came from Maharashtra to attend the Kisan Yatra rally at Jantar Mantar in Delhi
 jab ye kisaan maharashtra laut rahe the, to inke liye dilli se maharashtra ke liye vishesh train kii vyavastha kii gai
 The 160 km train running in the wrong direction, this train left Delhi for Maharashtra but reached Madhya Pradesh
 dilachasp baat yah he ki train 160 kimi tak galat disha main chalati rahi, lekin railway prashasan ke kisi adhikari or karmchaaree ko isaki bhanak tak nahin lagi
 Due to irresponsible attitude of the railway administration, these farmers got stuck at Banmore station in Madhya Pradesh instead of reaching their home
 mathura main mila galat signlabataya ja rahaa he ki mathura stesan main train ko galat signal diya gaya, jiske chalate train maharashtra kii bajaay madhya pradesh kii ore chali gai
 a passenger going to Kolhapur said that due to this negligence of the railway administration, the passenger remained stranded at Banmore station in Madhya Pradesh for about 5-6 hours
 banmor main fanse rahe yatri madan nike ne bataaya ki jab unhone is babatatrainke driver se poocha, to usne mathura stesan main galat signal die jane kii daleel di
 The driver said that the disturbance occurred due to the wrong signal and the train came to Madhya Pradesh
 unhone bataaya ki ab train brihaspativaar subah apane gantavy sthal pahonchegi
 Not only this, no railway official has even talked to passengers about this matter yet
 aam aadmi party bhale apane vidhayakon kii giraftaar ko lekar bijepi par sajeesh kaa aarope lagaati ho, lekin ek samay party kaa ahm hissaa rahe prashanth bhushan ne arvind kejariwal par bade sawaal khadey kiye hai
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, Prashant Bhushan has put forward a complaint of Kartar Singh, the current MLA of Aam Aadmi Party
 prashanth bhushan ke mutabik unhone or yogendra yadav ne 2015 main dilli vidhansabha chunaav se pehle taiyaar kii gai prastaavit ummidavaaron kii suchi main 12 ummidavaaron kii jaanch padtaal kii maang kii thi
 But Prashant Bhushan claims that Kejriwal ignored all complaints
 prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki 2015 chunaav hua to arvind ne prastaavit ummidavaaron ke naam website par nahin daale
 It was also learned that there are serious allegations against Kartar Singh, Sharad Chauhan and Pramila Tokas
 kartaarake bare main hamane kaha ki ye bijepi chhodkar aayaa he
 It has nothing to do with the ideology of AAP
 ye jalboard ke junior ejeeniyar the, or itani sampatti aa gai
 They have form houses, flats
 hamane kaha ki jaanch ke bina tikat nahin dena chahie
 According to Prashant Bhushan, a file was sent to the Lokpal to examine the proposed candidates before the elections in the Delhi Assembly, but the correct investigation was not done
 prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki lokapal ke paas 5 din the 12 ummidavaaron ke bare main jaanch ke liye kyonki chunaav sir par tha
 If concrete evidence of many was not found, he was asked to warn
 philhal ham sidhiravindki galati maanate hai
 Should not have given tickets without transparency
 AAP ke aane se zyada khuleen sharaab kii dukanembhushan ne aarope lagaaya ki kejariwal sarkaar ne sharaab kii dukaan dene kaa adhikaar vidhayakon ko de diya he
 Prashant Bhushan told Aaj Tak that the Aam Aadmi Party had said that without the Mohalla Sabha we will not allow liquor shops to open, but now the MLA has been given strength against it
 RTI main 58 nae sharaab ke theke khulne kii jaankaree mili or is vajah se sarkaar kaa exise bhi bad gaya
 Further Prashant Bhushan further said that those who claim Punjab as drug-free are increasing their addiction in Delhi
 dilli vidhansabha ko mili zyada taqathaalanki prashanth bhushan ne dilli vidhansabha ko zyada takat dene kaa samarthan kiya he
 He said that everyone knew, as the Constitution is, that everything will be done by the approval of LG
 koi bhi ayog, transfar bhi alji ke apruval se hoga
 But the Kejriwal government ignored this
 meraa maananaa he ki dilli vidhansabha ko zyada takat dene kii jarurat he
 On the question of the Kejriwal government's approach to the Supreme Court in the matter of fighting the rights of the central government, Prashant Bhushan said that according to the law, i do not think the Aam Aadmi Party will succeed in the Supreme Court
 dilli sarkaar ko zyada adhikaar dene or samvidhan badalane kii jarurat he lekin jo adhikaar hai usamen to kaam karen
 Apart from speeches, nothing happened in India today
 bhaashanon main hawaabazi koob he magar hawa ko lekar koi bhaashan nahin he
 Not even in those cities whose name has come in the polluted cities of the world
 aaj hi ek report ai he ki 2017 main bharat main hawa ke pradooshan ke kaaran 12 lakh logon kii maut hui he
 Now imagine that there has been news of the death of 1
2 million people, elections are going on but there is no speech on this question
 hamaare purv sahyogi hrydayesh joshi ne to aaj hi is par likhaa ki state of global air naam kii sanstha kii report bataa rahi he ki vaayu pradooshan ke kaaran bharat main 12 lakh log 2017 ke saal main maare gaye
 If anyone is wondering why there is no environmental issue in the election, then he should leave the election and watch IPL or WWF
 sochie hawaabazi vaale bhaashanon main hawa hi nahin he
 There is a musical instrument and a stunt
 indian express kii khushboo narayan kii ek report ai ki notebandi vaale saal main 88 lakh karadaata tex ritern nahin bhar paae
 Why could not the returns be filled because after demonetisation, economic activities stopped and people lost their jobs
 aamadani ghat gai
 At the same time this figure would have been awarded to these 88 lakh people
 kaala dhan kii samaapti ke liye apni naukari ganvaa kar yogadan karnaa mazaaq baat nahin he
 This report of Khushboo Narayan is very serious
 sochie jis faisle se 88 lakh logon kii naukari chali gai, yaa ve tex ritern bharne laayak nahin rahe, unhen kam se kam notebandi sammaan pramaan patr to dena hi chahie
 There is a difference between filling the return form and paying tax
 sarkaar ne bataaya tha ki 2016-17 main iskar ritern bharne waalon kii sankhya 1
 06 crores increased
 jabaki isi saal staff filers kii sankhya 10 guna zyaada badi
 Staff filers are those who file returns last year but do not fill the next year if they do not earn
 2015-16 main staff filers kii sankhya 8
 56 lakhs which increased to more than 88 lakhs in 2016-17
 notebandi ke samay desh seva samaj kar kaam karne vaale banker rose likhte hai ki unki selary badhaane kii baat kyon nahin kar rahaa hum
 Cashiers of the bankers paid a lot of money out of their pocket as fines
 lone lekar bhare
 Now their second trouble has started
 bank hi majaboor kar rahaa he ki lone lekar usee bank ke share khariden jisaki khasta haalat ko ve rose dekhte hai
 The bankers felt at the time of demonetisation that they were soldiers and also economists
 saare bankeron ne desh ke liye kuch karnaa chaha, isamen galat kya he
 Yes, whether the work was for the country or not, where is the answer? yah sahi he ki unhone bahut mehnat kii magar yah bhi sahi he ki unki selary nahin badi
 Bankers should question salary and shares with political parties
 yaa phir ipel ke score main man lagaaein, match khatm hote hi WWE dekhen or uske turant baad hindu muslim dibet, guarantee he ki das bees saal maze main nikal jaaenge
 You are all witnesses that i have kept the talk of the bankers, now you tell them not to whatsapp me
 main bankeron kii vyathaa samajhataa hum
 What to do
 emtnael or beasenel ke karmchaariyon ne haal hi main apane santhaan ke sankat or selary na milane ko lekar pradarshan kiye the
 Now if there is no talk on air, which killed 12 lakh people, there is no talk on demonetisation, due to which the number of staff filers who did not fill returns due to loss of job has increased, then why should anyone expect that nationalism and military Election will be held on the question of thousands of jobs being lost in BSNL and MTNL by changing the gear of elections
 sirf sankhya bataa dene se ki in purv navratnon main lakhon log kaam karte hai mudda nahin banataa he
 The news came that the ministry would have to take permission from the Election Commission to voluntarily retire 54000 employees of BSNL MTNL
 matlab chunaav ke samay 54000 karmchaariyon ko vidaa karne kaa idia aayaa bhi to kaise aayaa
 When so many people come to the field, the leaders start tweeting and from behind they are planning to make 54000 people walk
 khabaron main tha ki company ke board ne is prastaav ko sweekaar kar liya he ki ritair karaane ke liye umr gata diya jayega
 This news was published in Deccan Herald
 philhal siio kaa bayaan aa gaya he ki ham is tarah se kisi ko nahin nikaalenge
 We want to come up with an attractive VRS policy which employees will also like
 kya yah chunaav sena par ho rahaa he
 Because there is a lot of mention in the speeches of the army
 pehle kaha gaya ki sena par sawaal karnaa galat he
 It is now being said that it is wrong to use the army in elections
 sena ko lekar sahi kya he, galat kya he sab ghalmail ho gaya he
 Many a times it seems that the election of barracks or India is happening
 bhartiya sena modi ji kii sena kab se ho gai
 The Election Commission was considering Yogi's statement
 naqvi ji ne modi ji kii sena kah di
 Here former army chief VK Singh became Sirius
 hai to bijepi ke ummidavaar lekin yogi ji ke bayaan par aisa kah diya jo urban naksal bhi nahin kah paae
 In an interview to bbc's Jugal Purohit, if someone says that India's army is Modi's army, then it is not wrong but also a traitor
 modi kii sena kahana deshadroh he
 Just note this point of VK Singh
 magar ise mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ko dikhaane se bachein
 Saved and kept in email draft
 kai baar do netaaon ke bich sandeshvahak funs jaataa he
 JNU VC was such a good idea
 24 july 2017 ko jeenyu main kargil vijay diwas par tirangaa march hua tha
 The JNU vc's statement was published in the media that tanks have to be kept in the university so that the students can get acquainted with the sacrifices of the soldiers
 bijepi kii saansad minakshi lekhi ne bhi saport kar diya
 Imagine if there was work on this idea, there would be tanks in more colleges than the limit
 bharat main 39000 se adhik college hai
 The T90 tank comes to 15-16 crores
 itnaa sasta he ki 39000 tanks to ek order main kharid kar laga die jate
 It would have cost more than six lakh crores
 rashtrawaad ke liye itani raashi kuch bhi nahin he
 It is also possible that a toy tank should be installed in every college so that baby-nationalism can continue
 agar ham puraane tanks kharid laate to duniya ke saare second hand tanks bharat ke collejon ke saamne khadey ho jate
 It is okay that there are no teachers in the colleges of the towns, they do not teach, but if all the colleges had tanked, then the students without teachers would have at least become nationalists
 berojgaar banakar nikal rahe hai
 This is a very sad thing
 janata apane muddon se lard rahi he
 She is unable to decide what to do with her experience and issues
 media or bhaashanon se netaaon ne apane mudde us par thope die hai
 For example, if you went to Bihar, you could have asked the youngsters that the college in which you study is on Session Time, ie, 3 years BA is in 3 years or 5 years, then you will be asked if you are 3 years BA 5
 If you think about Pulwama while doing it in the year, what will be your answer? lekin kya bihar ke chaatro ne apni taraf se dilli se aae patrakaron ko yah samasya bataai
 If told, journalists would have written
 aaj main aapako ek nae andolan kii baat bataata hum
 The name of this movement is Magadh University Late Examination Movement
 mulya
 When have you heard such movement? magadh uniwarsity bihar kii sabase badi uniwarsity he
 Admission for BA, bsc, bcom for the 2016-19 season
 yah admician june 2016 main hua magar pratham varsh kii pariksha hui janvari 2018 main
 Three years have passed but the first year was tested and the result came
 2017-20 ke satr kii koi bhi pariksha nahin hui he
 2019 has come
 chaatro ne bataaya 2016-19 or 2017-20 ke satr main kareeb 4 lakh se adhik chaatr padhate hai
 The 3-year BA is taking place in 5 and a half years
 bihar uniwarsity main seshan let chalane ko lekar phone aate rahete hai
 Magadh University has another case
 asambandh college ke chaatro kaa
 Their number is more than 80,000
 cese mukademe main inkaa rigelt fansaa rah gaya or ye railway kii pariksha kaa farm nahin bhar sake
 The rest of the millions of students may not understand, but whose careers are being ruined, they do not understand
 bharosa tha ki prime time main aa jayega to pariksha ho jaaegi magar unka bharosa tut gaya
 Even after speaking and writing three to four times, it was not successful
 ab in chaatro ne you tub par magadh yaniversity let agzaam andolan launch kar diya he
 This is a big thing that you can see this video
 rajyon main rajdhaniyon or kasbon ke chaatr se jo ho rahaa he wo shabdon main bayaan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 That is why i believe that issues like Hindu Muslim and nationalism are carried forward only to suppress these problems
 sochie chaar paanch lakh chaatr teen saal kaa bie 5 saal main kar rahe hai
 Nobody bothers
 bahut mumkin he in chaatro ko hi fark nahin padataa ho
 May they be busy watching IPL and WWE, but congratulations to the few students who have taken this initiative
 oxford uniwarsity main yah research hona chahie ki ek universti ke bheetar 3 saal kaa bie 5 saal main karne par chaatro kii javaani main kaisaa nikhaar aata he
 This research should be launched at Harvard and discussed at the Gymkhana Club in Delhi
 kya aapako lagata he ki bihar uniwarsity or magadh uniwarsity ke chaatro ko raahat milegi
 i do not think so
 chaatro se guzarish he ki mujhe shukriya kaa messej na bhejein
 Congratulations to the leaders of Bihar
 chaatro ko bhi badhai
 They have proved that everything is not a career
 ipel or WWF bhi koi chiz hoti he

 Sushant and Kriti will be seen on-screen for the first time
 film 'rabta' 9 june ko relies hone vaali he
 Sushant and Kriti are seen holidaying in London uttar pradesh ke meerut main ek yuvati negangrepaur jabaran dharm parivartan karaane kii koshish kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The case is related to the Kithore police station area of meerut, where a young woman living there is alleged to have been held hostage in Agra for about 6 months
 is dauraan uske saath gangrape kiya gaya or phir dharm parivartan karaane kii koshish kii gai
 In fact, in a statement to the police, the victim told that she used to work in a photo shop in Meerut
 kareeb 8 maheene pehle gaanv ke hi ek adhyaaapak ne use manish goud naam ke ek yuvak se milaayaa
 The victim girl was told that Manish is a big business man and has several factories in Agra
 yuvati kaa aarope he ki manish use naukar dilaane ke bahaane agra le gaya jahaan use bandhak bana kar rakh liya gaya
 During this, Manish and his nephew Piyush raped her and tried to get her converted
 virodh karne par use or uske parivaar ko jaan se maarane kii dhamkee bhi di gai
 After getting a chance about two months ago, the victim girl fled and came back to Meerut
 aropiyon ke dar se peedit yuvati kareeb 2 maheene tak chup rahi lekin jab sabar kaa baandh tut gaya to use apni aapbeetee police ko bataai
 The police have registered a case of immediate rape, although the police have said that the FIR has not complained about conversion

 Santosh Hegde, a former Supreme Court judge and former Lokayukta of Karnataka, has said that there is nothing wrong in bringing the Prime Minister under the purview of Lokpal, as he too is like other public servants
 pradhanmantri ko lekar mahaan baat kya?nyaayamurti hegade ne kaha, ‘lokapal ke daayre main pradhanmantri ke hone main galat kya he? kya pradhanmantri lok sevak nahin hai? kya anya deshon main pradhanmantriyon ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke maamle nahin hote? japan main har duusare saal ek pradhanmantri par mukadmaa chalata he
 (former US President) Nixon prosecuted
 pradhanmantri ko lekar itani mahaan baat kya he?’ hegade ne kaha ki purv main bhi bhartiya pradhanmantriyon ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke aarope lagate rahe hai or keval raashtrapati or rajyapalon ko abhiyojan se chhot praapt he, pradhanmantri ko nahin
 Giving the example of 2 former pms, he said, 'we saw corruption charges against two former prime ministers in Bofors and JMM bribery case
 loktantr main kisi vyakti ko mahaj isliye abhiyojan se chhot kaise di ja sakati he, kyonki vah kisi pad par hai? samvidhan kuch maamalon main raashtrapati or rajyapalon ko abhiyojan se chhot detaa he
 This principle cannot apply to anyone who issues executive orders on a regular basis
 ’raajnneeti ke liye badi dhanrashi jarurservind kejariwal kii navgathit ‘aam aadmi party’ ke bare main yah puche jane ki usase kya ummiden hai, hegade ne isaki safalataa par andeh jataate hue kaha ki yah aasaan kaam nahin he
 He said, 'my only apprehension is that how will any political party be able to sustain itself due to so many demands of the political system in today's environment
 kashmir se kanyakumari tak se sansad ke kareeb 546 sadasyon ke nirvachan ke liye badi dhanrashi chahie hoti he
 This is no easy task
 ’nyaaypalikaon main bhi aniyamitataayenhegade ne kaha, ‘saidhantik taur par yah acchhee cheez he lekin kya hakeekat main yah safal ho sakati he
 On the question of Kejriwal's possible disclosures about corruption in the judiciary, he said, "didn't we hear about the irregularities in the judiciary?" There was a judge of the Supreme Court against whom the process of impeachment started but it was not completed
 ek mukhya nyaayadhish jinke khilaaf mahabhiyog kii kaarywahi shuru hui thi
 Justice Dinakaran, who resigned, therefore ended the proceedings
 ’hegade ne kaha, ‘kalakatta ucch nyaayalay ke saumitr sen the
 The process of impeachment against him started and stopped, reaching nowhere
 punjab ucch nyaayalay kii nyaayamurti nirmal yadav ke khilaaf aaropapatr daakhil kiya gaya
 CBI is investigating against 34 judges of Allahabad High Court
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘isliye vahaan bhi bhrashtachar he or unke paas kuch nyaayadhishon ke khilaaf kuch saamagree jarur hogi
 Asked whether self-regulation is a way to control corruption within the judiciary, he said, "we tried it and it did not succeed
" hamane itane saalon tak iskaa prayaas kiya
 Everyone said about the judiciary that we will self-regulate, we will control, the higher courts will keep an eye on the lower courts
 kuch bhi nahin hua
 Hegde agreed when asked if he wanted an ombudsman who had the authority to investigate and prosecute judges
 unhone kaha, ‘nyaayadhishon kii jaanch koun karegaa? koi to hona chahie
 If you want a separate inquiry vigilance unit of retired judges then make it, it is fine but it should not be outside the scope of investigation
 ’ hegade ne kaha, ‘jis nyaayadhish kii jaanch ho rahi he vah usee sanstha, adaalat main ja sakate hai jisamen vah ek nyaayadhish hai or phir vah jaanch par sawaal uthaa sakate hai

 Mayawati told in a press conference in the capital Lucknow last Tuesday that the BSP has decided on all 403 seats in the state assembly, out of which 87 tickets belong to Dalits, 97 tickets to Muslims and 106 seats belong to other backward classes

 Senior BJP leader and Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi has declared RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav as the biggest landlord of Bihar
 modi kaa daawa karte hue kaha ki mujhe lagata he ki bihar main jitani badi sampatti lalu ke parivaar ne ikaitha kar liya he shaayad hi kisi netaa yaa udyogpati ke paas hogi
 Today he is the largest landlord of Bihar
 unka kahana he ki ye sari sampatti benami he
 Making serious allegations of corruption on Lalu Yadav, Modi said that he has created assets in lieu of working, in lieu of giving tickets, in lieu of making a minister, in lieu of making MP and MLA
 railway kaa hotel dene ke evaj main 200 karod kii keemat kii jameen likhva liya, sharaab factory ke evaj main patna shahar main keemtee jameen likhva liya
 Lalu Prasad Yadav was opposing demonetisation as it is all benami property
 modi ne lalu prasad yadav ko chunauti dete hue kaha ki agar unamem himmat he to ise nakaar den
 He said that more revelations are yet to be made
 susheel modi chaara ghotaale main lalu prasad yadav se pehle hi do-do haath kar chuke hai
 And now this episode started with the mud scam has reached the benami property
 patna ke saguna mode ke paas lalu prasad yadav kaa parivaar bihar kaa sabase bada mal banavaa rahe hai
 Its soil was found in Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park in Patna
 jaivik udyaan bihar sarkaar ke van vibhaag ke tahat he jiske mantri lalu prasad yadav ke bade bete tejpratap yadav hai, is maamle kii shuruuaat hui thi
 Later Modi revealed that the land on which the mall is being built has been given to Lalu Prasad Yadav in lieu of leasing two railway hotels to a hotelier at that time when he was the railway minister of the country
 pehle ye jameen unke kareebi rahe purv mantri prem gupta kii patni ke naam par thi baad main us company ke nideshak lalu prasad yadav ke bete tejpratap yadav or tejasvi yadav ke saath-saath unki beti chanda yadav ban gai
 On this, Modi questioned that Lalu should tell who is in possession of the land of Ai Info Systems Private Company today
 dilit marketing jiske paas 2 acre he jis par 500 karod kaa mal ban rahaa he, aaj uskaa maalik koun he
 He said that Lalu Yadav used to survive in the whole case first because from 2004 to 2014 there was UPA government at the center and he was railway minister for five years
 2009 se 2014 tak bhi upie kii sarkaar inhen ke badaulat chal rahi thi
 So CBI and Income Tax helped, the arbitrary returns were filed, no one inquired, but now they do not have a government at the Center, and CBI is a fair working body, so i am CBI, ED, Income Tax Will also go to tax, railway ministry
 susheel modine nitish kumaar se bhi aagrah kiya ki wo baar-baar kehete hai ki benami sampatti par hamalaa hona chahie, ye to bihar ke andar benami sampatti he, bihar ke andar jo kanoon he wo swayan sakasham he us par karrwai karne ke liye
 Modi said that first of all, Tejashwi and Tej Pratap, who hid assets worth crores of rupees, who did not mention in their affidavit should be sacked
 un par karrwai karnaa chahie
 Chanda Yadav, who used the Chief Minister's address unscathed, is also going to be signed in 2014 and Tejashwi and Tej Pratap, so did Tej Pratap and Tejashwi in 2014 not know that Rabri or Lalu was not in this house but Whether Nitish Kumar or Jitan Ram Manjhi live, Chanda Yadav did not know that his father vacated the house in 2005
 modika daawa he ki bade paimaane par farjivada hua he or ye us samay se hua jab 2000 main rabari devi mukhyamantri banati hai or 2004 main lalu rail mantri rahete hai
 The purchase of all land has been done between 2000 and 2014
 jameen kharida nahin gaya he, likhvaya gaya he, madad karne ke evaj main ye bhrashtachar nivaaran adhinium ke andar maamla aata he kii jameen aapane kharidi nahin likhvaya gaya, to pehle saare khulaase ho jaaen, uske baad jahaan-jahaan janaa hoga jaaenge
 Because it is not just about soil
 unhone kaha ki abhi ye bhi pramaan aaenge kii mantri banane ke evaj main kis tarah se lalu ne jameen likhvaya he, tikat dene ke evaj main log saamne aa rahe hai isliye ye chaara ghotaalaa or alkatraa ghotaalaa se bhi bada ghotaalaa he
 But, do Nitish Kumarkarvai, show courage
 naitikta kii baat karte hai, sari paardarshita ke baad jahaan tak janaa hoga ham jaaenge or doodh kaa doodh or pani kaa pani hoga, jahaan kaa darwaja khatkhataana hoga khatkhataayenge

 The link between the two countries is closely linked with the Ministry of External Affairs, but Minister of State for External Affairs VK Singh remains silent on the deteriorating relations with China and the tension between the india-china border

 The Delhi government, which is fighting for the rights of the Center, has suffered a major setback from the Supreme Court
 supreme court ne centre ke khilaaf dilli sarkaar kii arji par sunwaayee karne se manaa kar diya he
 It has also said that the High Court's decision in the case should be awaited
 dilli sarkaar ne centre ke saath adhikaron ke takaraav ko lekar hoicourt main chal rahi sunwaayee ko supreme court main chunauti di thi
 Explain that the Delhi government had also filed an application in the High Court
 maamle kii sunwaayee hoicourt main puri ho chuki he or court ne apana faisla bhi surakshit rakh liya he
 On this matter, the Supreme Court has clearly told the Delhi government that the High Court has its powers, first let its order come
 supreme court ne yah bhi kaha he ki pehle dilli sarkaar hi hoicourt kaa darwaja khatkhatane gai thi or ab vah hoicourt kii sunwaayee se asantusht hokar usko chunauti dene ke liye supreme court ai he
 It is against the rules

 Because of that, he has committed suicide

 Pawan Nangia, the husband of a woman named Anuradha, works for property dealing
 pawan ke mutabik, guuruuvaar ko ve kedarnath se darshan karke laute the or phir apane offis chale gaye
 At night, his wife Anuradha and 6-year-old son Chavis were at his house in J-block, West Patel Nagar

 Anuradha and innocent Chavis had a blood-soaked corpse inside
 pawan ne hi is dohare hatyakand kii soochna police ko di
 Initial investigations have revealed that the cause of the mother-son killing is not robbery
 police ke mutabik, hatyara koi parichit ho saktaa he, kyonki ghar main kisi ke jabaran ghusane kaa koi nishaan nahin mila he
 Surprisingly, Anuradha and her son were killed with a sharp weapon, yet no neighbor could even hear them scream
 jis flats main hatya hui, wo domanzila imaarat main he
 The police suspect that the reason for the murder may have been a conspiracy

 Have you seen a life wasting factory? In India, factories have been opened to destroy lives in metros and districts, which we call University in English and University in Hindi
 is kaarkaane kii kubsuurati yahi he ki jisaki zindagi barbaad hoti he use fark nahin padataa
 The one who is wasting does not even matter
 uttar pradesh ke doctor ram manohar lohia uniwarsity main is saal bie or eme ke 80 fisadi chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 The university where more than four lakh students fail should be the biggest news in the world
 kya aapane suna he ki oxford, harvard, michigan uniwarsity ke 80 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye? or kisi ko koi fark nahin pad rahaa he
 In the local edition of Hindi newspapers, the university is taking credit that this time the copying was stopped by installing video cameras, so many students have failed
 morrkhtaa kii had na hoti to vishvavidhyalay prashasan is tarah ke daawey nahin karata
 After all, why is the level of education in the colleges of this university so bad that 80 percent of the students fail in the examination without cheating
 us uniwarsity main vaais chancelar, principal, professor or lekturer phir kis liye aate hai
 Is there a failure to study here? This is not only a terrible incident in the world of education, but in India, which should have been covered like earthquake and tsunami isiilie maine kaha ki bharat main uniwarsity ke naam par kasbon se lekar mahanagaron tak main chaatro ko barbaad karne kaa kaarkaana khulaa hua he
 This doctor is Ram Manohar Lohia Awadh University in Faizabad
 is uniwarsity main zyaadaatar garvanment aded or privet college hai
 Their number is said to be over 600
 kai college aise hai jahaan 10,000 se lekar 20,000 tak chaatr padhate hai
 In 2017-18, BA and b
sc, b
com three-year and post-graduate level 1
5 lakh students took the exam
 80 pratishat fail ho gaye to is hisaab se fail hone vaale chaatro kii sankhya kareeb 4 lakh 80,000 ke kareeb chaatr fail hai
 Over 80 percent of BSC third year students fail
 biessi pratham varsh main 56 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 Ganapat Sahay Post Graduate College of Sultanpur had about 300 students in the final year in mathematics but only 20-25 of these have passed
 275 ke kareeb fail ho gaye hai
 One student said that for 300 students there are one Permanent Professor and two are Adahk
 final year main ganit main chaar paper hote hai
 You can also guess what kind of messing up with the lives of young people
 is college main 18000 se adhik chaatr padhate hai
 If there will not be permanent teachers, they will not get good salary, then who will teach? nakal roak dene kaa shrey lenaa aasaan he, lekin kya sirf nakal roki gai yaa phir pariksha main aakhri vakt main badlaav kiya gaya
 This is also a serious question
 bie or eme kaa chaatr objective tip jawaab dekar nikalegaa to phir ucch shiksha kaa matlab kya hua
 Many teachers kept the identity secret, stating that students had no practice of objective systems
 vaise bhi bhugol or jeev vigyaan kaa chaatr bina rekha chitra banaae, vistaar se samajhaae kaise sabit karegaa ki use vishay kaa gyaan hua he
 Numbers in Mathematics are also found that how right the way to solve the question was till the end, only the solutions are not found
 lekin fail hone vaale zyaadaatar chaatr tisare varsh ke hai, jahaan pehle kii tarah hi prashn pache gaye
 All this information has come from the students
 kya aapako yah sunakar hairaani nahin hui ki ek garib rajya kii uniwarsity dobaaraa copy check karne ke liye 3000 rupee leti he
 Three thousand copies
 agar kisi chaatr ko teen copy kii jaanch karaani he to use 9000 dene honge
 Accordingly, if 4 lakh students apply for re-examination, then the university will get 120 crores out of the pocket of these poor students
 kya ye dakaiti nahin he? avadh uniwarsity ke college jin ilaakon main hai vahaan ke zyaadaatar chaatr garib yaa saadhaaran pariwaron ke hai
 3000 is a lot for them
 uniwarsity kii website par saaf saaf likhaa he ki uttar pustika ke avlokan se asantusht chaatr uttar pustika milane kii taarikh se 15 din ke andar 3000 rupee prati prashnptr kii dar se shulk kaa bhugtan kar chalange eveluation ke liye aavedan kar sakegaa
 Not only this, copying the number and changing the conditions is also complicated, ie it is certain that 3000 students will also drown
 kya jaanboojh kar yuvaaon ko is tarah se barbaad kiya ja rahaa he taaki ve sirf or sirf whats ap ke propeganda ko hi gyaan samaj saken
 These questions have to be asked by the youth of India
 varna uniwarsity kii haalat dekhakar ek siddhant bina nobel liye yaheen pratipaadit kar saktaa hum ki agar kisi desh kii javaani ko aasaani se barbaad kar dena he to wo bharat he
 Just send the youth to a university
 jo chaatr saal bhar kii fees 4000 detaa he wo copy dobaaraa check karaane ke liye 21000 degaa kya yah anyaay nahin he
 If it is not injustice and robbery then what is it? chatro ne hi jaankaree bheji he, or khud hi record kar bheja he
 Our colleague Pramod Srivastava said that after looking at many marksheets, it is found that the student has got 60 numbers out of 75 in one paper but zero in the other paper
 agar gadabadi nahin he to phir register or pariksha niyantrak ko kyon hataaya gaya
 Why was there such a mess at the top? agar rigelt sahi nahin hue to bie paas kar pratiyogita pariksha main jane vaale or aage padhane vaale chaatro kaa kya hoga
 Why is this messing with his career? aapako bihar uniwarsity kaa haal to pataa hi hoga jahaan 2017 ke saal main ek bhi pariksha nahin hui
 It is possible that the students there will also be busy and busy in whats up Hindu Muslim propaganda throughout the year
 vaise hamane apni uniwarsity series main 17 aktubar ko is ram manohar lohia uniwarsity kaa haal bataaya tha
 The comments ayodhya ke sabase bade college kamta prasad sundar laal saket post graduate college main kareeb 11000 chaatr-chatraayen registerd the
 There should have been 145 regular teachers here, but only 85 at that time
 85 shikshakon par 11000 chaatro ko padhaane kaa karishma sirf us bharat main ho saktaa he jahaan mantriyon ke bachche kabhi padhane nahin aate hai
 Their children go to study where 20 students have one professor
 shikshak bataate hai ki kai collejon main kaagaj par shikshakon kii sankhya puri milegi magar ve vahaan hote hi nahin hai
 This is also a kind of scam
 aded college main bahut se permanent shikshak padhaate to hai magar management jin shikshakon ko 15-20 hazaar kii selary par rakhata he unki dilchaspee nahin hoti or na hi yogya hote hai
 Also think what would be the quality of lecturer teaching at a salary of 20,000
 sochie varanaa bahut der ho jaaegi or aise college karodon naujavaanon ko hameshaa ke liye barbaad kar chuke honge
 Before the youngsters from house to house do not become fit after spending three-three years in the university, let us change our questions
 netaaon ne naujavaanon ko keechad main phenk diya he
 The young man is playing his ruined Holi with that mud
 aap kab puuchhenge ki 6 ames main 70 fisadi shikshak nahin hai
 What type of doctor is your child leaving from institutions like AIIMS without a teacher? sochie ames jaise sansthaanon main chune jane ke liye kitna parishram karnaa hota he
 Do you think that India can be better whose youth, whose factories to waste their youth, are open
 hindi akhabaaron ke sthaneey sanskaran main vishvavidhyalay is baat kaa shrey le rahaa he ki is baar video camere laga kar nakal roak di gai, isliye itane chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 The university administration would not have made such claims if there were no limits of stupidity
 aakhir is uniwarsity ke collejon main padhai kaa str itnaa karaab kyon he ki bina nakal kii pariksha hone par 80 pratishat chaatr fail kar jaaen
 Vice Chancellor, Principal, Professor and Lecturer then come for that university
 kya yahaan fail hone kii padhai hoti he? yah bharat hi nahin vishwa ke shiksha jagat kii bhayankar ghatana he, jise bukamp or sunami kii tarah cover kiya janaa chahie tha
 That is why i said that in India in the name of university, factories have been opened to waste students from towns to metros
 faizabad main he ye doctor ram manohar lohia avadh uniwarsity
 This university has mostly government-aided and private colleges
 inaki sankhya 600 se adhik bataai jaati he
 There are many colleges where 10,000 to 20,000 students study
 2017-18 main bie biessi, bikom ke teenon saal ke or post graduate str ke sava chah lakh chaatro ne pariksha di thi
 If 80 percent failed, then about 4 lakh 80,000 students failed due to this
 biessi third year ke 80 pratishat se adhik chaatr fail hai
 In BSC first year, 56 percent students have failed
 sultanpur ke ganpat sahay post graduate mahavidhyalay ke ganit main final year main kareeb 300 chaatr the lekin inamen se maatr 20-25 chaatr paas hue hai
 Nearly 275 have failed
 ek chaatr ne bataaya ki 300 chaatro ke liye ek permanent professor hai or do adahak hai
 There are four papers in Mathematics in the final year
 aap isse bhi andaaza laga sakate hai ki naujavaanon ke jivan ke saath kis tarah kaa khilwaad ho rahaa he
 This college has more than 18000 students
 agar sthaayee shikshak nahin honge, unhen acchhee tankhwaah nahin milegi to padhayega koun
 It is easy to take credit for stopping the copying, but whether the copying has been stopped or the last minute change in the examination
 yah bhi ek gambhir sawaal he
 BA and MA students will give objective type answers then what is the meaning of higher education
 kai shikshakon ne pahchaan gupt rakhte hue bataaya ki chaatro ko objective system kaa koi abhyaas nahin tha
 Anyway, a student of geography and biology will prove that he has knowledge of the subject without drawing in detail
 ganit main number is baat ke bhi milte hai ki aakhir tak sawaal ke hal karne kaa rasta kitna sahi tha sirf aakhir hal par hi nahin milte hai
 But most of the students who failed are in the third year, where questions were asked as before
 yah sari jaankaree chaatro se mili he
 Are you not surprised to hear that a poor state university charges Rs 3000 for a copy check again? ek copy ke teen hazaar
 If a student wants to check three copies then he has to give 9000
 is hisaab se 4 lakh chaatro ne dobaaraa jaanch ke aavedan kiye to uniwarsity ke paas in garib chaatro kii jeb se nikal kar 120 karod aa jaaenge
 Isn't this a robbery? Most of the students in the areas where the colleges of Awadh University are in are from poor or ordinary families
 unke liye 3000 kii raashi bahut he
 It is clearly written on the university's website that a student dissatisfied with the observation of the answer book will be able to apply for the challenge evaluation within 15 days from the date of receipt of the answer book by paying a fee of Rs 3000 per question paper
 yahi nahin number dene or badalane kii sharten bhi copy jatil hai yani tay he ki chaatr ke 3000 bhi doobenge
 Is the youth being deliberately ruined in such a way so that they can understand the propaganda of whats app only and knowledge only
 ye sawaal bharat ke naujavaanon ko khud se poochna he
 Seeing the condition of Varna University, i can give a theory here without taking Nobel that if you want to ruin the youth of any country easily then it is India
 bas naujavaanon ko aap kisi uniwarsity main bhej dijie
 a student who pays 4000 fees for a year will give 21000 to get the copy checked again, is it not an injustice
 agar yah anyaay or dakaiti nahin he to phir kya he
 The students have sent the information, and have recorded it themselves
 hamaare sahyogi pramod shrivastav ne bataaya ki kai marksheet dekhne par pataa chalata he ki chaatr ko ek paper main 75 main 60 number aae hai magar duusare paper main zero aayaa he
 If there is no problem then why was the registrar and exam controller removed
 awwal to aisi gadabadi hui kyon
 If the results are not correct, what will happen to the students who pass the BA and go to the competition examination
 unke kariyar ke saath ye khilwaad kyon ho rahaa he
 You will know the condition of Bihar University where not a single examination was conducted in the year of 2017
 mumkin he vahaan ke chaatr bhi saal bhar whats ap hindu muslim propeganda main vyast or mast honge
 By the way, in our university series on October 17, we had told the condition of this Ram Manohar Lohia University
 tippaniyan About 11000 students were registered in Kamta Prasad Sundar Lal Saket Post Graduate College, the largest college in Ayodhya
 yahaan 145 regular shikshak hone chahie the, magar us vakt 85 hi the
 The charisma of teaching 85,000 teachers to 11000 students can happen only in India where the children of ministers never come to study
 unke bachche vahaan padhane jate hai jahaan 20 chaatro par ek professor hota he
 Teachers tell that in many colleges the number of teachers on paper will be met, but they are not there at all
 yah bhi ek kism kaa ghotaalaa he
 Many aided teachers teach in the aided college, but the management, which the management puts on salary of 15-20 thousand, is not interested nor qualified
 yah bhi sochie ki 20,000 kii selary par padhaane vaale lekturer kii kya gunvattta hogi
 Think otherwise it will be too late and such colleges will have ruined crores of youth forever
 isse pehle ki ghar-ghar main noujvaan teen-teen saal uniwarsity main guzaarane ke baad kisi laayak na bane, ham apane sawaal badal len
 The leaders have thrown the youth into the mud
 noujvaan us keechad se apni barbaadi kii holi khel rahaa he
 When do you ask that 6 AIIMS does not have 70 percent teachers? bina teacher ke ames jaise sansthaanon se aapkaa baccha kis tip kaa doctor ban kar nikal rahaa he
 Think how much hard work it takes to get elected in institutions like AIIMS
 aap sochie kya vah bharat behatar ho saktaa he jiske naujavaanon ko, jisaki javaani ko barbaad karne kii factriyaan khuli hui hai

 Three thousand copies
 agar kisi chaatr ko teen copy kii jaanch karaani he to use 9000 dene honge
 Accordingly, if 4 lakh students apply for re-examination, then the university will get 120 crores out of the pocket of these poor students

 Not only this, copying the number and changing the conditions is also complicated, ie it is certain that 3000 students will also drown

 uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri vijay bahuguna ne ravivaar ko kaha ki uttarakhand main bheeshan baadh kaa shikaar hue logon kii sahi sankhya kaa kabhi pataa nahin chal paaegaa
 They estimate that the death toll in this tragedy can range from hundreds to thousands
 bahuguna ne kaha, ham un logon kii sankhya kaa sahi-sahi pataa kabhi nahin laga paaenge, jo maare gaye, jo log malbe main dabe rah gaye yaa baadh ke pani main bah gaye
 Assembly Speaker Govind Singh Kunjwal had said on Saturday that the number of casualties could be up to 10,000, but the chief minister said the figure was incorrect
 bhayanak traasadee ke baad jindagi ko saamaanya karne kii jaddojahad main jute logon kii mushkilon ke bich unhone kaha, 500-600 shav dekhe ja sakate hai, na keval kedarnath ilaake main, balki puure rajya main
 The Chief Minister dismissed criticism of the state government for handling the situation and terming it a man-made tragedy
 bahuguna ne kaha ki jahaan tak rajya ke laapata logon kaa sawaal he, jila prashasan is par kaam karegaa
 He said, we will give compensation to the suffering people of our state and this work will be done quickly
 unhone kaha ki jahaan tak anya rajyon ke logon kaa sawaal he, unhen apane rajyon main shikaayatein darj karaani chahie
 The Chief Minister said, if the states confirm to Uttarakhand that the people of their states had come here on pilgrimage and that so many pilgrims should be considered dead and not so many people returned
 
 
 tab ham unki baat ko sweekaar karenge or sambandhit mukhya sachivon ko muaavja raashi unke rajyon ke peediton ko vitarit karne ke liye di jaaegi
 Bahuguna said, DIG rank officer is in Kedarnath and has been entrusted with the responsibility of cremation of the dead bodies
 antim sanskaar kii prakriya jari he
 He told that the dead bodies lying in the streets are being cremated
 bahut se logon ke shav un imaaraton main fanse pade hai, jinamein ve rah rahe the, lekin unhen baahar nikaalane ke liye kuch mashiinon kii jarurat he
 Some JCB machines are being provided
 bahuguna ne bataaya ki vayusena or lok nirmaan vibhaag jesibi ke dizin aadi kaa faisla kar rahaa he, jinhen helicopteron se in jagahon par le jaaya jayega
 He said, no one can reach the dead bodies lying in Rambada
 lekin sawaal yah he ki ham kya karen, jisase ki paryaavaran pradooshit nahin ho
 Some chemicals and powder will have to be used
 aapadaa par karrwai ko lekar ho rahi aalochana ke sambandh main sawaal kiye jane par unhone kaha ki sena or sarkaar kii behad twarit javaabi pratikriya thi
 The chief said, there was no delay
 keval kharaab mausam or sadak sampark kii samasya ke chalate unhen vahaan pahunchane main samay laga
 But when they arrived, the big truth is that thousands of people were evacuated and in the last few days more than one lakh people were evacuated without having law and order problems there
 iskaa shrey rajya sarkaar ko janaa chahie ki vahaan kanoon-vyavastha kii koi samasya nahin thi
 The Chief Minister said that there were more than 200 villages where there was no contact and they would have to be rebuilt
 iske liye ek surveykshan kiya gaya he or visheshgyon se salaah-mashvira kiya jayega
 The comments unhone bataaya, in gaanvon ke liye bhojan bheja jayega
 working in progress
 ham khaanaa bhej rahe hai, taaki gramin do maah tak guzaara kar saken
 Relief materials are kept at district headquarters
 mukhyamantri ne bataaya ki saptaah bhar main sabhi sthanon ke liye kachche raste banaae jaaenge, taaki kuch sampark behaal ho sake
 He said, no village will be left where relief materials are not reached
 yah hamaari praathamikta he
 This work will take some time, because the paved roads cannot be built during the monsoon
 bahuguna ne kaha, main is par aapse sahamat nahin hum ki yah maanav nirmit aapadaa he
 We do not control disasters
 main tsunami, bukamp yaa badal fatne kii ghatana ko nahin roak saktaa
 In such a situation, what can i do to save my life? aapadaaen hamaare niyantran main nahin hai
 Bahuguna said, "we will never be able to find out exactly the number of people who died, those who were buried under debris or were swept away by the flood waters
" vidhansabha adhyaksh govind singh kunjwaal ne shanivaar ko kaha tha ki maare gaye logon kii sankhya 10 hajaar tak ho sakati he, lekin mukhyamantri ne kaha tha ki yah aankada galat he
 Amidst the difficulties of people trying to normalize life after a terrible tragedy, he said, 500-600 bodies can be seen, not only in Kedarnath area, but across the state
 mukhyamantri ne halaat se nipatane ko lekar pradesh sarkaar kii aalochana tathaa ise maanav nirmit traasadee bataae jane ko khaarij kiya
 Bahuguna said that as far as the missing people of the state are concerned, the district administration will work on it
 unhone kaha, apane rajya ke peedit logon ko ham muaavja denge or is kaam ko jaldi kiya jayega
 He said that as far as the people of other states are concerned, they should lodge complaints in their states
 mukhyamantri ne kaha, yadi rajya, uttarakhand ko is baat kii pushti karte hai ki unke rajyon ke log tirthayatra par yahaan aae the or itane tirthayatriyon ko mrit maan liya janaa chahie or itane log waapas nahin laute
 
 
 Then we will accept their point and the compensation will be given to the Chief Secretaries concerned to distribute the compensation to the victims of their states
 bahuguna ne kaha, diaiji rank ke adhikari kedarnath main hai or unhen shavon ke antim sanskaar kii jimmedaari saunpi gai he
 The funeral procession continues
 unhone bataaya, jo laashen galiyon main padi hai unka antim sanskaar ho rahaa he
 The bodies of many people are trapped in the buildings in which they were living, but some machines are needed to get them out
 kuch jesibi mashine uplabdh karai ja rahi hai
 Bahuguna said that the Air Force and Public Works Department are deciding the design of JCB, which will be taken to these places by helicopters
 unhone bataaya, jo shav rambada main pade hai, un tak koi pahunch nahin saktaa
 But the question is what should we do so that the environment is not polluted
 kuch rasayan or powder kaa istemaal karnaa padegaa
 When asked about the criticism about the action on the disaster, he said that there was a very quick response from the army and the government
 mukhyamantri ne kaha, koi deree nahin hui
 It only took them time to get there due to bad weather and road connectivity problems
 lekin jab ve pahunche, to badi sachai yah he ki hajaaron logon ko nikaala gaya or pichley kuch dinon main ek lakh se adhik logon ko bina vahaan kanoon-vyavastha kii samasya hue nikaala gaya
 The credit should go to the state government that there was no law and order problem there
 mukhyamantri ne bataaya ki vahaan 200 se adhik gaanv the, jahaan koi sampark nahin tha or inkaa punarnirmaan karnaa hoga
 a survey has been done for this and experts will be consulted
 tippaniyan He told, food will be sent to these villages
 kaam pragati par he
 We are sending food, so that the villagers can live for two months
 raahat saamagree jila mukhyalayon par rakhi hui hai
 The Chief Minister said that raw routes will be made to all the places in the week so that some connectivity can be restored
 unhone kaha, koi gaanv aisa nahin choda jayega, jahaan raahat saamagree nahin pahunche
 This is our priority
 is kaam main kuch samay lagegaa, kyonki monsoon ke dauraan pakki sadaken nahin banaai ja sakati
 Bahuguna said, i do not agree with you that this is a man-made disaster
 aapadaaon par hamaara niyantran nahin he
 i cannot stop the occurrence of tsunami, earthquake or cloudburst
 aise halaat main main kya kar saktaa hum ki kaise main apane logon kii jaan bachaaun
 Disasters are not under our control

 The morning news came that Devendra Fadnavis was taking oath as Chief Minister
 kuch hi der baad fadanvis ne rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) netaa ajit pavaar ke saath shapath le lee
 But after this oath, the politics of the state intensified
 sarkaar banane kii kavayad main juty shivasena, congress or ensipi is ghatana ke baad puri tarah se harakat main aa gai or raat hote-hote sharad pavaar kii ore se in dalon ko aashwast kiya gaya ki sab control main he
 If NCP chief Sharad Pawar claims that all is well, then it is to be believed that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is not caught in the vortex in the process of forming a government for the second time in a row
 ajit pavaar ke saath fadanvis ke shapath grahan ke baad ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ne kaha tha ki rajya main navaniyukt sarkaar kaa ensipi samarthan nahin karti he
 Even Sharad Pawar in his press conference introduced the mlas who were present during the swearing-in with Ajit Pawar
 chitthee ke dam par khelaa gaya khelensipi chif sharad pavaar kii ore se aarope lagaaya gaya ki ajit pavaar ne ek chitthee ke bal par puraa khel rachaa
 As the leader of the party's Legislative Party, Ajit Pawar had the signatures of all the party mlas and he went to the Governor with the same letter
 isi chitthee ko ajit pavaar ne vidhayakon ke samarthan ke rup main pesh kiya
 NCP MLA Rajendra Shingne said that Ajit Pawar called 8 to 10 mlas and asked them to come to Dhananjay Munde's bungalow
 jab ham sab bangale pahunche to vahaan se hamen rajyapal nivas le jaaya gaya
 But we did not know anything about why the Governor's residence is being taken
 thodi der baad achaanak devendra fadanvis aae or unhone mukhyamantri pad kii shapath le lee
 Ajit Pawar was sworn in as Deputy CM after CM Devendra Fadnavis
 shapath grahan ke baad devendra fadanvis or ajit pavaar (ani)sharad pavaar kii baithak main 42 vidhayaksharad pavaar kii ore se yah aarope bhi lagaaya gaya ki jis chitthee ko ajit pavaar ne rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari ko saunpa us chitthee par 54 vidhayakon ke hastakshar the, lekin ise galat tareeke se pesh kiya gaya
 After the swearing-in, there was a huge political outcry in Mumbai
 sharad pavaarane ensipi ke sabhi vidhayakon kii baithak bulaai
 However, it was said from the party that the meeting will start only after all the mlas arrive
 sharad pavaar ne kaaphi der tak intjaar kiya or phir jaakar baithak shuru kii or apane bhattije ko party vidhayak dal ke netaa se bedakhal kar diya
 Dhananjay Munde, who appeared at the swearing in ceremony with Ajit Pawar, joined Sharad Pawar's meeting in the evening
 baithak main ensipi ke vidhayak dal ke nae netaa chune gaye jayant patil ne daawa kiya ki baithak main 54 main se 42 vidhayak shaamil hue
 While 7 mlas are in touch
 ravivaar ko hone vaali baithak main 49 vidhayak shaamil honge
 However, 5 mlas are unable to be contacted
 sharad pavaar kii aguwai main ensipi kii baithak main hissaa lete vidhayamb kya karegi bijepi?agarsharad pavaar apni partiko tut se bachaane or apane vidhayakon ko ajit pavaar ke kheme main jane se rokane main kaamyaab ho gaye hai to bijepi ke liye aage kii raah kya hogi
 The BJP had won 105 seats in the assembly elections while the ally Shiv Sena won 56 seats, but the Shiv Sena split from the BJP
 bijepi ke paas 105 vidhayak hai or use bahumat sabit karne ke liye 288 sadasyeey vidhansabha main bahumat sabit karne ke liye 145 vidhayakon kaa samarthan chahie or is jaadui number se vah 40 kadam dur he
 In such a situation, if there are only a few mlas in Ajit Pawar's camp, then BJP has not got into that letter
 bataa den ki shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne saaf kaha he ki ajit pavaar ke saath sirf chaar vidhayak hai
 In such a situation, questions are also being raised that if the Supreme Court orders the floor test and Sharad Pawar is able to keep up with his party's mlas, then it may have to be given for BJP

 " bharat main takreeban 850 jivit bhashaaen hai or pichley 50 saal main kareeb 250 bhashaaen vilupt huin
 This was revealed in the 'public Survey of Indian Languages' (PLSI) by the Institute of Language Research and Publication Center of renowned linguist Ganesh Devi

 Devi, 63, a professor of English at the University of Vadodara in 1996, said that out of the 780 languages that PLSI studied, 400 languages were prepared with grammar and vocabulary
 maan liya jaae ki inamen se koi 100 bhashaaon kaa adhyayan pehle bhi kiya gaya ho tab bhi inamen se 300 bhashaaon kaa record isse pehle un bhashaaon ko bolne vaale samudaay se baahar kabhi taiyaar nahin kiya gaya

 If the number of Hindi speakers is around 40 crores, then the number of people speaking Majhi in Sikkim is only four
 devi ne bataaya ki is surveykshan main un bhashaaon ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya he jinhen bolne waalon kii sankhya 10,000 se kam he kyonki 1971 main bangladesh yuddh ke baad desh main bhashaai sangharsh kii ashanka ko viraam dene ke liye sochi-samajhi ranneeti ke tahat janaganana main un bhashaaon ko shaamil karnaa band kar diya gaya jinhen bolne waalon kii sankhya 10,000 se kam ho

 karnataka vidhansabha main dinabhar chale siyaasi drame ke baad guuruuvaar ko floor test nahin ho paaya
 In this way, the Kumaraswamy government has got one more life, so the bjp's hopes got a big shock
 bijepi ko puraa bharosa tha ki agar vishwaas mat par voting hoti to kumaraswami sarkaar gir jaati
 Now let us know what options BJP has
 bijepi rajyapal ke paas phir se ja sakati he or kah sakati he ki vishwaas mat par vot ke liye ek samay seemaa tay kii jaae, agar rajyapal samay seemaa tay bhi kar den to phir kya spikar ise maanenge, isamen bahut andeh he
 However, the governor has asked the speaker to test the trust vote at 1
30pm on Friday
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki spikar rajyapal ke aadesh ko maanenge yaa phir usee tarah se andekha karenge jaisaa aaj kiya he
 If voting on the trust vote is postponed, then the BJP can bring a no-confidence motion
 avishvaas prastaav ko sweekaar kiye jane ke liye spikar 14 din kaa samay le sakate hai
 If the Congress and JDS withdraw the motion of confidence, then the BJP will have to bring a no confidence motion
 ye bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki bijepi or congress donon supreme court ja sakati he
 The BJP may approach the Supreme Court for the floor test
 bijepi sir ke bal khadi he ki vishwaas mat prastaav par jald se jald voting ho, taaki congress or jedies ko ab or adhik samay naa mil jaae
 Anyway, Congress and JDS have got six days since the session started

 The trailer of Sunny Deol's popular film 'mohalla Asi' has been leaked
 utyub par jari kiya gaya yah trailor kaaphi vivaadit najar aa rahaa he
 The story of the movie 'mohalla Assi', which describes the current state of tourism of Varanasi, is based on Kashinath Singh's Hindi novel 'kashi Ka Assi'
 film ke li hue trailor main kai bold seens ke alaava aapattijanakadialogbhi shaamil hai
 In a scene shown in the trailer, Lord Shiva is seen abusing his devotee
 yahi nahin apane filmi kariyar main kabhi bhi gaali naa dene vaale actarasni deolbhi is film main aapattijanak bhashaa kaa istemaal karte najar aa rahe hai
 Dr

 Watch the trailer of the movie 'mohalla Assi': bhagat singh 28 march 1907 ko janme the or 23 march 1931 kii taarikh par unhen angrejon ne faansee par lataka diya tha
 It is said that the age of those who are martyred for the country stops there
 aisa lagata he jaise bhagat singh aaj bhi hamaare bich hai
 23-year-old beau and rebellious youth
 jinhen virodh, anathak sangharsh, inqalaab or samaajwaad kaa pratik mana jaataa he
 Those who believed that they could not kill ideas by crushing individuals
 jo kranti kii talwaar vichaaron kii saan par tej karne kii manshaa rakhte the
 It has been 110 years since Bhagat Singh was born, but his writing and thinking have become more relevant today than before
 unhone us choti umr main hi samrajyavad or sampradayikta par dhaava bolne kaa kaam kiya tha
 Looking at his writings and ideas, it becomes difficult to guess how a 23-year-old young man has the ability to bite the ears of the elders not only in speech but also in gratitude
 aise maukey par ham aap sabhi ke liye bhagat singh dwaara likhaa gaya unka behad charchit lekh "main naastik kyon hum?" saajha kar rahe hai
 He wrote this article in the remarks of freedom fighter brother Randhir Singh
 gauratlab he ki randhir singh ek samay bhagat singh ke kesh kataa lene se khafa the or unhone bhagat singh se milane se inkaar kar diya tha
 He considered himself a true Sikh and believed that fame spoiled Bhagat Singh's mind
 vahiin bhagat singh desh ke liye gardan katwane kii patibaddhta bhi rakhte the
 He composed this document at such a time
 aap bhi padhein unka yah bahucharchit lekh
 
 
 a new question has arisen
 kya main kisi ahankaar ke kaaran sarvashaktimaan, sarvyaapee or sarvagyani ishwar ke astitv par vishwaas nahin karata hoon? mere kuch dost– shaayad aisa kahkar main un par bahut adhikaar nahin jamaa rahaa hoon– mere saath apane thode se sampark main is nishkarsh par pahunchne ke liye utsuk hai ki main ishwar ke astitv ko nakaar kar kuch zarurat se zyaada aage ja rahaa hoon or mere ghamand ne kuch had tak mujhe is avishvaas ke liye uksaaya he
 i do not boast that i am far above human weaknesses
 main ek manushya hoon, or isse adhik kuch nahin
 No one can claim to be more than this
 yah kamazori mere andar bhi he
 Ego is also part of my nature
 apane commeredon ke bich mujhe nirankush kaha jaataa tha
 Even my friend Mr
 Batukeshwar Kumar Dutt used to say this to me sometimes
 kai maukon par swechhachari kah meri ninda bhi kii gai
 Some friends have a complaint, and seriously, that i involuntarily impose my thoughts, on them and get my proposals made
 yah baat kuch had tak sahi he
 i do not deny it
 ise ahankaar kaha ja saktaa he
 As far as our own opinion is concerned against other popular opinion
 mujhe nishchay hi apane mat par garv he
 But it is not personal
 aisa ho saktaa he ki yah keval apane vishwaas ke prati nyyochit garv ho or isko ghamand nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Boasting is an excess of undue pride towards oneself
 kya yah anuchit garv he, jo mujhe naastikta kii ore le gaya? athwa is vishay kaa khub saavdhaanee se adhyayan karne or us par khub vichaar karne ke baad maine ishwar par avishvaas kiya?main yah samajhane main puri tarah se asafal rahaa hoon ki anuchit garv yaa vruthabhimaan kis tarah kisi vyakti ke ishwar main vishwaas karne ke raste main roda ban saktaa he? kisi vastav main mahaan vyakti kii mahanata ko main manyata na don– yah tabhi ho saktaa he, jab mujhe bhi thodaa aisa yash praapt ho gaya ho jiske yaa to main yogya nahin hoon yaa mere andar ve gun nahin hai, jo iske liye aavashyak hai
 Even this makes sense
 lekin yah kaise ho saktaa he ki ek vyakti, jo ishwar main vishwaas rakhata ho, sahasaa apane vyaktigat ahankaar ke kaaran usamen vishwaas karnaa band kar de? do hi raste sambhav hai
 Either man starts thinking of himself as a rival of God or he starts thinking of himself as God
 in donon hi avasthaaon main vah sachcha naastik nahin ban saktaa
 In the first stage, he does not deny the existence of his rival
 duusari avasthaa main bhi vah ek aisi chetana ke astitv ko maanata he, jo parde ke peeche se prakruti kii sabhi gatividhiyon kaa sanchaalan karti he
 i only deny the existence of that almighty supreme soul
 yah ahankaar nahin he, jisane mujhe naastikta ke siddhanth ko grahan karne ke liye prerit kiya
 i am neither a rival, nor an avatar nor the divine self
 is abhiyog ko asweekaar karne ke liye aaie tathyon par gaur karen
 According to these friends of mine, due to the unnecessary fame i got during the Delhi Bomb Case and Lahore Conspiracy Case, i have probably become old-fashioned
 meraa naastikatawaad koi abhi haal kii utpatti nahin he
 i had stopped believing in God when i was a young man
 kam se kam ek kalege kaa vidhyaarthee to aise kisi anuchit ahankaar ko nahin paal-pos saktaa, jo use naastikta kii ore le jaye
 Although i was a favorite of some teachers and some others i did not like
 par main kabhi bhi bahut mehnatee athwa padhaaku vidhyaarthee nahin rahaa
 Could not get any chance to get trapped in ego-like feeling
 main to ek bahut lajjalu swabhaav kaa ladkaa tha, jisaki bhavishya ke bare main kuch nirashaavadi prakruti thi
 My Baba, under whose influence i grew up, is a conservative Arya Samaj
 ek arya samaji or kuch bhi ho, naastik nahin hota
 After completing my primary education, i d
 e
 V
 skool, lahore main pravesh liya or puure ek saal uske chatravaas main rahaa
 There, apart from morning and evening prayers, i used to chant Gayatri Mantra for hours
 un dinon main puraa bhakt tha
 Later i started living with my father
 jahaan tak dharmik roodhiwaadita kaa prashn he, vah ek udaaravaadi vyakti hai
 His education inspired me to dedicate my life to the cause of freedom
 kintu ve naastik nahin hai
 He has a strong belief in God
 ve mujhe pratidin puja-prarthana ke liye protsaahit karte rahete the
 This is how i was raised
 asahyog aandolan ke dinon main rashtriya kalege main pravesh liya
 It was here that i began to think, think and criticize all the religious problems - even the existence of God liberally
 par abhi bhi main pakkaa aastik tha
 Till that time i had long hair
 yadhyapi mujhe kabhi-bhi sikh yaa anya dharmon kii puranikta or siddhanton main vishwaas na ho sakaa tha
 But i had strong faith in the existence of God
 baad main main krantikari party se judaa
 The first leader i met there could not have dared to deny the existence of God despite having no firm faith
 ishwar ke bare main mere hath purvak poochhate rahane par ve kehete, 'jab ichha ho, tab puja kar liya karo
 'this is atheism, which lacks courage
 duusare netaa, jinke main sampark main aayaa, pakke shraddhalu aadarneey kamred shacheendra nath sanyaal aajkal kakori shadyantra cese ke silsile main aaajeevan kaarvaas bhoga rahe hai
 His book 'bandi Jeevan' is a loud anthem of the glory of God
 unhone usamen ishwar ke upar prashansa ke pushp rahasyatmak veydant ke kaaran barasaaye hai
 The 'revolutionary' (revolutionary) paper distributed across India on January 28, 1925, is the result of his intellectual labor
 usamen sarvashaktimaan or uski lila or kaaryon kii prashansa kii gai he
 My mistrust of God did not even arise in the revolutionary party
 kakori ke sabhi chaar shaheedon ne apane antim din bhajan-prarthana main gujaarey the
 Ram Prasad 'bismil' was an orthodox Arya Samaji
 samaajwaad or samyawad main apane vrihad adhyayan ke baavjood rajen lahadi upanishad evam gita ke shlokon ke uccharan kii apni abhilaashaa ko dabaa na sake
 i saw only one person among them who never prayed and said, "philosophy arises due to the weakness of man or limited knowledge
" vah bhi aaajeevan nirvaasan kii sajaa bhoga rahaa he
 But he too never dared to deny the existence of God
 is samay tak main keval ek romantic adarshavaadi krantikari tha
 Till now we used to follow others
 ab apane kandhon par zimmedaari uthaane kaa samay aayaa tha
 This was a defining point in my revolutionary life
 ‘adhyayan’ kii pukaar mere man ke galiyaaron main goonj rahi thi– virodhiyon dwaara rakhe gayi tarkon kaa saamana karne yogya banane ke liye adhyayan karo
 Read to be able to argue in favor of your opinion
 maine padhanaa shuru kar diya
 This refined my old thoughts and beliefs wonderfully
 romance kii jagah gambheer vichaaron ne le lee, na or adhik rahasyavaad, na hi andhvishwaas
 Realism became our basis
 mujhe vishvakranti ke anek aadarshon ke bare main padhane kaa khub mauka mila
 i read Buchanin, the anarchist leader, Marx, the father of communism, but more Lenin, Tratsky, and others who successfully brought revolution in their country
 ye sabhi naastik the
 Later i got the book 'sahaj Gyan' by Niralamb Swami
 isamen rahasywaadee naastikta thi
 By the end of 1926, i was convinced that the talk of an almighty supreme soul, who created, guided and operated the universe, is a blatant nonsense
 maine apane is avishvaas ko pradarshit kiya
 i debated this topic with my friends
 main ek ghoshit naastik ho chukaa tha
 In May 1927 i was arrested in Lahore
 railway police hawalat main mujhe ek maheenaa kaatna padaa
 The police officers told me that i was in Lucknow when the Kakori team was on trial, that i had talked about some plan to get them released, that we had obtained some bombs after getting their consent, that in 1927 Dussehra On the occasion of one of those bombs was thrown at the crowd for testing, that if i make a statement highlighting the activities of the revolutionary party, i will not be arrested and To the contrary will be i will be released without presenting the informant in court and reward
 main is prastaav par hansaa
 It was all useless
 ham logon kii bhanti vichaar rakhane vaale apni nirdosh janata par bam nahin phenkaa karte
 One day in the morning c
 ai
 D
 ke varisht adheekshak shri newman ne kaha ki yadi maine vaisaa vaktavy nahin diya, to mujh par kakori cese se sambandhit vidroh chhedane ke shadyantra or dashahra updrav main krur hatyaon ke liye mukadmaa chalaane par baadhya honge or ki unke paas mujhe sajaa dilaane or phaansi par latakavane ke liye uchit pramaan hai
 From the same day, some police officers started luring me to praise God both times by the rule
 par ab main ek naastik tha
 i wanted to decide for myself whether i would boast of being an atheist in the days of peace and joy, or even in such difficult times, i can stick to those principles
 bahut sochane ke baad maine nishchay kiya ki kisi bhi tarah ishwar par vishwaas or prarthana main nahin kar saktaa
 No, i did not do it even for a moment
 yahi asli pareekshan tha or main safal rahaa
 Now i was a firm believer and have been consistent ever since
 is pareekshan par khara utarana aasaan kaam na tha
 'faith' lightens the sufferings
 yahan tak ki unhen sukhkar bana saktaa he
 In God, a base can be found that is extremely comforting to man
 uske bina manushya ko apane upar nirbhar karnaa padataa he
 Standing on your feet between the storm and the storm is not a child's play
 pariksha kii in ghadiyon main ahankaar yadi he, to bhaap ban kar ud jaataa he or manushya apane vishwaas ko thukaraane kaa saahas nahin kar paata
 If it does, then it leads to the conclusion that it has no other power but just ego
 aaj bilkul waisi hi sthiti he
 The full address of the decision is
 ek saptaah ke andar hi yah ghoshit ho jaayegaa ki main apana jivan ek dhyey par nyochaavar karne ja rahaa hoon
 Apart from this idea, what else can be the consolation? a Hindu who believes in God can hope to be a king on rebirth
 ek musalmaan yaa isai swarg main vyaapt samruddhi ke anand kii or apane kashton or balidaan ke liye puraskaar kii kalpana kar saktaa he
 But what can i expect? i know that the moment the loop of the rope falls on my neck and the bottom of my foot falls, it will be a complete stop - that will be the last moment
 main yaa meri aatma sab vahiin samaapt ho jaayegi
 Nothing will be ahead
 ek choti si juujhati hui zindagi, jisaki koi aisi gauravshaalee parinti nahin he, apane main swayan ek puraskaar hogi– yadi mujhamen is drushti se dekhne kaa saahas ho
 Without any selfishness here or without a desire for rewards after here, i have surrendered my life to the goal of freedom, because i could not do anything else
 jis din hamen is manovriti ke bahut-se purush or mahilaayein mil jaayenge, jo apane jivan ko manushya kii seva or peedit maanavtaa ke uddhaar ke atirikt kahin samarpit kar hi nahin sakate, usee din mukti ke yug kaa shubharambh hoga
 They will be motivated to challenge exploiters, oppressors and oppressors
 is liye nahin ki unhen raja bananaa he yaa koi anya puraskaar praapt karnaa he yahan yaa agle janm main yaa mrityoparant swarg main
 They will have to adopt this path to take the slavery gamble from the neck of humanity and establish liberation and peace
 kya ve us raste par chalenge jo unke apane liye khataranaak kintu unki mahaan aatma ke liye ek maatr kalpaneey rasta he
 Will his pride be misinterpreted as arrogance towards this noble cause? Who would dare to speak such a disgusting adjective? Either he is stupid or sly
 hamen chahie ki use kshamaa kar den, kyonki vah us hriday main udwelit ucch vichaaron, bhaawanaaon, aavegon or unki gaharaai ko mahasoos nahin kar saktaa
 His heart is dead like a piece of flesh
 uski aankhon par anya swaarthon ke preton kii chaaya padane se ve kamazor ho gayi hai
 The virtue of trusting oneself can always be termed as ego
 yah dukhapurna or kshtprad he, par chaara hi kya he?aalochana or swatantra vichaar ek krantikari ke donon anivaary gun hai
 Because our ancestors had built faith in some supreme soul
 atah koi bhi vyakti jo us vishwaas ko satyata yaa us param aatma ke astitv ko hi chunauti de, usko vidharmee, vishwasghaatee kaha jaayegaa
 If his arguments are so irrefutable that he cannot be rebutted by reason and his faith is so strong that he cannot be suppressed by showing fear of the plagues caused by the wrath of God, then he will be reprimanded by saying that he is boisterous
 yah meraa ahankaar nahin tha, jo mujhe naastikta kii ore le gaya
 The way my reasoning proves to be satisfactory is to be decided by my readers, not me
 main jaanata hoon ki ishwar par vishwaas ne aaj meraa jivan aasaan or meraa boj halakaa kar diya hota
 My mistrust of him has made the whole atmosphere very dry
 thodaa-sa rahasyavaad ise kavitvamay bana saktaa he
 But my fate does not need any frenzy
 main yathartwaadee hoon
 i want victory over inner nature with the help of conscience
 is dhyey main main sadaiv safal nahin hua hoon
 It is man's duty to try
 safalataa to sanyog or vaataavaran par nirbhar he
 Someone who is a bit rational, would try to understand their environment logically
 jahaan sidhaa pramaan nahin he, vahaan darshan shaastra kaa mahatv he
 When our ancestors tried to understand the mystery of the world, its past, present and future, its why and where at the time of leisure, every person in the difficult lack of direct results solved these questions in their own way
 yahi kaaran he ki vibhinn dharmik maton main hamako itnaa antar miltaa he, jo kabhi-kabhi vaimnasy or jhagade kaa rup le letaa he
 Not only are there differences in views of East and West, but each hemisphere has differences among its different views
 purv ke dharmon main, islam or hindu dharm main zaraa bhi anurupata nahin he
 In India itself, Buddhism and Jainism are very different from Brahmanism, in which opposing opinions like Arya Samaj and Sanatan Dharma are found
 puraane samay kaa ek swatantra vichaarak charvak he
 He challenged God in the old times itself
 har vyakti apane ko sahi maanata he
 It is unfortunate that instead of the old thinkers' experiences and ideas as the basis of the fight against ignorance in the future, we, like slackers, continue to shout the unwavering and unshakeable faith in the statement of what we have proved and The types are guilty of rooting the development of humanity
 sirf vishwaas or andh vishwaas khataranaak he
 It makes the brain dumb and human reactionary
 jo manushya apane ko yathartwaadee hone kaa daawa karata he, use samast pracheen rudhigat vishwaason ko chunauti deni hogi
 The prevailing opinion has to be tested on the basis of logic
 yadi ve tark kaa prahaar na sah sake, to tukade-tukade hokar gir padegaa
 Then to establish the new philosophy, to make them completely dashed, to clear the place and to reconstruct using some things of the old beliefs
 main pracheen vishwaason ke thospan par prashn karne ke sambandh main aashwast hoon
 i firmly believe that a conscious supreme soul, who guides and guides the movement of nature, has no existence
 ham prakruti main vishwaas karte hai or samast pragatisheel aandolan kaa dhyey manushya dwaara apni seva ke liye prakruti par vijay praapt karnaa maanate hai
 There is no conscious power behind this direction
 yahi hamaara darshan he
 We want to ask the believers some questions
 yadi aapkaa vishwaas he ki ek sarvashaktimaan, sarvavyaapak or sarvagyani ishwar he, jisane vishwa kii rachana kii, to krupa karke mujhe yah bataayen ki usne yah rachana kyon kii? kashton or santapon se purna duniya – asankhya dukhon ke shaashvat anant gathbandhanon se grasit! ek bhi vyakti to puri tarah santrusht nahi he
 Please do not say that this is his rule
 yadi vah kisi niyam se bandhaa he to vah sarvashaktimaan nahin he
 He is also a slave to rules like us
 krupa karke yah bhi na kahen ki yah uskaa manoranjan he
 Nero had just lit a romp
 usne bahut thodi sankhya main logon kii hatya kii thi
 He caused very little sorrow for his complete entertainment
 or uskaa itihaas main kya sthaan he? use itihaaskaar kis naam se bulaate hai? sabhi vifaille visheshan us par barasaaye jate hai
 The pages are blackened by his blasphemous sentences, denouncing - Nero a heartless, merciless, wicked
 ek changez khan ne apane anand ke liye kuch hajaar jaane le leen or aaj ham uske naam se ghrinaa karte hai
 Then how do you justify your god? To the eternal Nero, who has been, and still continues to give, every day, every hour, and every minute, innumerable miseries
 phir tum kaise uske dushkarmon kaa paksh lene kii sochate ho, jo changez khan se prayek kshan adhik he? kya yah sab baad main in nirdosh ksht sahane waalon ko puraskaar or galati karne waalon ko dand dene ke liye ho rahaa he? thik he, thik he
 How long will you justify the person who dares to inflict wounds on our body afterward to apply soft and comfortable ointments? To what extent would the administrators of the Gladiator institution justify throwing a man in front of a hungry ferocious lion That, if he saves her life, she will be looked after very well? That is why i ask why that conscious supreme soul created this world and humans in it? To rob you of joy? Then what is the difference between him and Nero? You Muslims and Christians! You do not believe in past lives
 tum to hinduon kii tarah yah tark pesh nahin kar sakate ki pratyakshtah nirdosh vyaktiyon ke ksht unke purvajanmon ke karmon kaa fal he
 i ask you, why did that Almighty work for six days for the creation of the world by word? And why does he say every day that everything is fine? Call him today
 use pichhlaa itihaas dikhaao
 Let him study today's conditions
 ham dekhenge ki kya vah kehane kaa saahas karata he ki sab thik he
 From imprisonment to slums to slum settlements to millions of starving humans, from exploited laborers who are patiently watching the bloodsucking of capitalist vampires and seeing the waste of manpower that anyone sees Even the person, who has little knowledge, will tremble with fear, instead of distributing more production to the needy people in the sea To throw it better, to the palaces of the kings whose foundations lay on the bones of human beings - let him see it all and then say - everything is fine! Why and from where? This is my question
 tum chup ho
 Okay, then i go ahead
 or tum hinduon, tum kehete ho ki aaj jo ksht bhoga rahe hai, ye purvajanm ke paapi hai or aaj ke utpeedak pichley janmon main sadhu purush the, atah ve satta kaa anand lut rahe hai
 i have to admit that your ancestors were very clever people
 unhone aise siddhanth gadhe, jinamein tark or avishvaas ke sabhi prayaason ko vifal karne kii kaafii takat he
 According to jurisprudence, punishment can be justified for only three reasons depending on the effect it has on the offender
 ve hai – pratikaar, bhay or sudhaar
 Today the theory of retaliation is condemned by all progressive thinkers
 bhaybheet karne ke siddhanth kaa bhi ant vahiin he
 The principle of reform is only necessary and is essential for the progress of humanity
 iskaa dhyey apradhi ko yogya or shantipriy naagarik ke rup main samaaj ko lautaanaa he
 But even if we consider human beings to be criminals, what is the nature of punishment given to them by God? You say that he produces them by making cows, cats, trees, herbs or animals
 tum aise 84 lakh dandon ko ginate ho
 i ask, what is their effect on humans as reformers? How many people have you met who say that they were born as donkeys in a past life due to some sin? not even one? Do not give examples from your Puranas
 mere paas tumhaari puranic kathaon ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 And then do you know that the biggest sin in the world is to be poor
 garibi ek abhishaap he
 This is a punishment
 main poochta hoon ki dand prakriya kii kahan tak prashansa karen, jo anivarytah manushya ko or adhik aparaadh karne ko baadhya kare? kya tumhaare ishwar ne yah nahin sochaa tha yaa usko bhi ye sari baaten maanavtaa dwaara akathaneey kashton ke jhelane kii keemat par anubhav se seekhni thim? tum kya sochate ho, kisi garib yaa anpadh parivaar, jaise ek chamaar yaa mehtar ke yahan paidaa hone par insaan kaa kya bhagya hoga? chunki vah garib he, isaliye padhai nahin kar saktaa
 He is despised and abandoned by his peers, who consider themselves high due to being born into a high caste
 uskaa agyaan, uski garibi or usase kiya gaya vyavhaar uske hriday ko samaaj ke prati nishthur bana dete hai
 If he commits a sin, who will bear the consequences? Ishwar, he himself or the saint of society? And what about the punishments of those whom the arrogant Brahmins deliberately kept ignorant and who had to bear the punishment of having to bear a stream of melted lead in their ears because of listening to some sentences of your sacred books of knowledge - the Vedas? If they commit a crime, who will be responsible for it? And who will bear their blow? My dear friends! These principles are inventions of privileged people
 ye apni hathiyaan hui shakti, poonji or ucchata ko in siddhanton ke aadhaar par sahi tehraate hai
 Uptan Sinclair wrote that just make a man believe in immortality and then rob all his property
 vah bagaiyr badbadaaye is kaary main tumhaari sahaayta karegaa
 Jails, hangings, whips and these principles arise only from the alliance of the preachers of religion and the masters of power
 main poochta hoon tumhaara sarvashaktishaalee ishwar har vyakti ko kyon nahin us samay roktaa he jab vah koi paap yaa aparaadh kar rahaa hota he? yah to vah bahut aasaani se kar saktaa he
 Why didn't he end the fighting rage of the fighting kings and thus save him from the plagues of humanity by the world war? Why did he not evoke the feeling of liberating India in the British mind? Why wouldn't it fill the benevolent zeal in the hearts of the capitalists to relinquish their right to personal property over the means of production, and thus only liberate the entire labor community, but the entire human society, from the capitalist fetters? You want to argue the practicality of socialism
 main ise aapke sarvashaktimaan par chhod detaa hoon ki vah lagu kare
 As far as general good is concerned, people regard the virtues of socialism
 ve iske vyaavhaarik na hone kaa bahaanaa lekar iskaa virodh karte hai
 Let the divine come and do that thing in the right way
 angrejon kii hukumat yahan isaliye nahin he ki ishwar chahta he balki isaliye ki unke paas takat he or hamamen unka virodh karne kii himmat nahin
 They have not placed us in their dominion with the help of God, but with the help of guns, rifles, bombs and bullets, police and army
 yah hamaari udaseenta he ki ve samaaj ke viruddh sabase nindaneey aparaadh – ek raashtra kaa duusare raashtra dwaara atyaachaar purna shoshan – safaltaapurvak kar rahe hai
 Where is God? Is he enjoying these sufferings of mankind? a Nero, a Genghis, destroy him! Do you ask me how do i explain the origin of this world and the origin of man? Okay let me tell you
 chalrs darvin ne is vishay par kuch prakaash daalane kii koshish kii he
 Read it yah ek prakruti kii ghatana he
 Earth formed by accidental mixing of various substances, in the shape of a nebula
 kab? itihaas dekho
 Animals were born from this type of phenomenon and humans in a long period
 darwin kii ‘jeev kii utpatti’ padho
 And then all the development was done by man's constant opposition to nature and the desire to conquer it
 yah is ghatana kii sambhavtah sabase sookshm vyakhya he
 Your second argument could be why a child is born blind or lame? Is it not the result of the work done in his previous birth? Biologists have found a scientific solution to this problem
 avashya hi tum ek or bachakaana prashn puch sakate ho
 If there is no God, then why did people believe in him? My answer is subtle and clear
 jis prakaar ve preton or dusht atmaaon main vishwaas karne lage
 The only difference is that belief in God is universal and philosophy is highly developed
 isaki utpatti kaa shrey un shoshakon kii pratibha ko he, jo paramatma ke astitv kaa upadesh dekar logon ko apane prabhutv main rakhana chaahate the or unase apni vishisht sthiti kaa adhikaar evam anumodan chaahate the
 All religions, sects, religions and other such institutions eventually become the supporters of ruthless and exploitative institutions, individuals and classes
 raja ke viruddh har vidroh har dharm main sadaiv hi paap rahaa he
 After recognizing man's limitations, understanding his weaknesses and demerits, to encourage man to face bravely in the hour of examination, to face all the dangers with masculinity and to bind his explosion in prosperity and majesty
 Fantasy existence was created
 apane vyaktigat niyamon or abhibhavakeey udaartaa se purna ishwar kii badha-chadha kar kalpana evam chithran kiya gaya
 He is used as a fear-monger when he discusses his rage and personal rules
 taaki koi manushya samaaj ke liye khatara na ban jaye
 When his guardian qualities are explained, he is used as a father, mother, brother, sister, friend and helper
 jab manushya apane sabhi doston dwaara vishwasghaat or tyaag dene se atyant klesh main ho, tab use is vichaar se santvana mil sakati he ki ek sadaa sachcha dost uski sahaayta karne ko he, usko sahaara degaa or vah sarvashaktimaan he or kuch bhi kar saktaa he
 In fact it was useful for the society in the primitive period
 pidaa main pade manushya ke liye ishwar kii kalpana upyogi hoti he
 Society has to fight against this belief
 manushya jab apane pairon par khadaa hone kaa prayaas karata he or yathartwaadee ban jaataa he, tab use shraddha ko ek ore phenk dena chahie or un sabhi kashton, pareshaaniyon kaa purushatv ke saath saamana karnaa chahie, jinamein paristhitiyaan use patake sakati hai
 This is my position today
 yah meraa ahankaar nahin he, mere dost! yah mere sochane kaa tarika he, jisane mujhe naastik banaaya he
 i consider faith in God and daily prayer to be the most selfish and fallen work for man
 maine un naastikon ke bare main padhaa he, jinhone sabhi vipadaaon kaa bahaduree se saamana kiya
 Therefore, i also want to stand up high till the last moment of the noose as a man
 hamen dekhnaa he ki main kaise nibhaa paata hoon
 a friend of mine asked me to pray
 jab maine use naastik hone kii baat bataayi to usne kaha, ‘'apane antim dinon main tum vishwaas karne lagoge
 "I said," No, dear friend, that will not happen
 main ise apane liye apmanjanak or bhrasht hone kii baat samajhaata hoon
 i will not pray for selfish reasons
 '’ pathakon or doston, kya yah ahankaar he? agar he to main sweekaar karata hoon

 The film is scheduled to release in May this year

 Recently the poster of Akshay Kumar starrer film 'kesari' was released
 is poster main ek aisi baat thi jise lekar kuch logon ne aapatti jataai
 Hindi Fortnight is being celebrated all over the country because of Hindi Day
 lekin isi dauraan akshay kii film ke poster par hindi bhashaa ke niraadar kaa aarope laga
 Actually, the film's Hindi title on the poster was written in "roman script"
 aisa pehali dfa nahin hua he
 The content written on the posters of all the films of Hindi cinema is in Roman
 ek tarah se dekhen to ye kisi bhashaa kii lipi ke saath "dhokhadhadi" he
 The language in which the producers and directors earn crores by making films, do not pay attention to the script of the same language
 hindi cinema kii filmon main samvaad or gane to hindi main hote hai, lekin iske posters or credit line aksar roman main likhe jate hai
 Barring a few stars like Amitabh Bachchan and Randeep Hooda, most Hindi cinema actors do not like to write in Hindi
 amitabh aksar apane soshal acount par hindi main likhte rahete hai
 Do actors feel ashamed to speak Hindi? Sunny Leone or the stars of the South who understand the difficulty of understanding or speaking Hindi
 lekin wo abhinayta jo hindi prishthbhumi se aate hai - saarvajanik maukon par hindi main baat karne ko tavajjo nahin dete
 Most actors answer in Hindi when someone asks a question in Hindi
 haalanki isamen kai abhinayta aise bhi hai jo hindi main hue sawaal par bhi english main hi jawaab dena pasand karte hai
 It is also disrespect from the actors with their language of employment
 jis bhashaa kii filmon main kaam karke kalakaar naam or shoharat kamaate hai, saarvajanik maukon par uske prati unki eemaandaaree bharosa karne laayak nahin he
 However, artists like Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar answer in Hindi only when asked questions in Hindi and in English when questions are asked in English
 zyaadaatar nae sitaron main bolchaal kii hindi ke prati yah approach najar nahin aata
 For which audience are such posters made? Currently, most films are to be released in multiplexes
 single screen ke khatme ke saath hi filmon ke poster kii prastuti main bada badlaav saafe dekha ja saktaa he
 Posters of most of the films appear with Roman or English titles
 haalanki dakshin yaa duusari bhartiya bhashaa main banane vaali filmon ke saath aisa nahin he
 This was not done before in Hindi also
 agar puraani filmon ke poster par gaur karen to angreji ke saath hindi or urdu main filmon ke tital likhe jate the
 The Hindi cinema world has to come out of inferiority complex towards Hindi
 behatar yah hoga ki filmon ke posters or sabatital main hindi ko badhaava den

 Only then can we win a medal in the Olympics

 samay ke saath behatar hogounhone cricket website iespien crickinfo se kaha, 'yah (videshon main pradarshan) samay ke saath behatar hoga
 i have gained a lot of experience from my time spent in Australia
 maine wicket lene ke maukey taiyaar kiye or ballebaajon par kaaphi dabaav banaaya
 In Australia i think 30 overs a day is a commendable effort for a spinner
 yadi mujhase poochhoge ki aap 25 wicket lenaa chaahoge yaa acchhee gendbaaji karnaa to main kahuunga ki acchhee gendbaaji karnaa kyonki main jaanata hum ki isse aapako wicket bhi milenge
 'ashwin's performance is very good in the subcontinent
 Let us tell you that Ashwin's performance has been very good on the pitches of the subcontinent
 unhone yahaan khele 16 test maichon main 23
 Has taken 100 wickets at an average of 87
 haalanki videshon main khele nau test maichon main aswin 56
 Only 24 wickets at an average of 58
 jald hi karuunga acha pradarshthasvin ne aage kaha, 'ho saktaa he ki ek din main australia main ek din main chah wicket hasil karun or main kahuun ki main yahi hasil karnaa chahta tha
 i have played one Test in South Africa and two Tests in England
 yadi main bharat main test kheltaa hum to turant hi paanch wicket hasil kar saktaa hum lekin ho saktaa he ki england yaa dakshin africa main aisa tisare yaa chauthe test match main ho
 This could not happen but it could happen soon
 'videshon main team ke liye ahm bhoomika nibhaane kii ichsvin kaa kahana he ki vah upmahadweep ke baahar team ke pradarshan main ahm bhoomika nibhaana chaahate hai
 Ashwin said, 'I need to do this to be a better bowler
 meraa maananaa he ki yah bhagya he kyonki tab tak maine 18 test match khele the or inamen se bahut kam main meraa pradarshan bura rahaa
 When you go abroad, if everyone plays their role well then the role of spinner becomes quite easy
 mujhe adhik se adhik jimmedaari leni chahie
 i also want to match old veterans
 mujhe khushi hogi yadi main bharat ko adhik maichon main jeet dilaataa hum
 'kohli has been very much like me about the new captain of the team, Virat Kohli, Ashwin said,' i always tried to contribute and be the best performer in the team i played for
 kaaphi had tak viraat bhi aisa hi he or mujhe uskaa ravaiya pasand he kyonki ham donon bahut bhinn tareeke se apana kaam karte hai
 He is very aggressive and wants to stay ahead
 main puri tarah se aisa nahin hum lekin phir bhi main mukhya bhoomika main rahanaa chahta hum
 If he is doing this for India as a batsman then i want me to do it for India as a bowler
 ham donon main ek cheez samaan he ki ham lagaataar sudhaar karnaa chaahate hai or tarifon par phool kar kuppa nahin hona chaahate hai
 i am really impressed by this quality of which i believe it is not found in all people
 'captaini bhagya se judi haijab aswin se poocha gaya ki kya vah bharat kaa captain banane kii ichha rakhte hai? unhone kaha, 'yadi aap do yaa teen saal pehle mujhase yah sawaal karte to main bhi kisi joshilay yuva kii tarah haa karata
 There are many business barriers
 main nahin kahuunga ki yah praathamikta he kyonki yah mere haath main nahin he
 i really believe in myself as a leader but i believe that leadership is something that needs to be recognized

 Critics have also given good response to this film released today
 is film ko mil rahe achche rispons ko dekh kaha ja rahaa he ki pehle din yah film box offis (pati Patni Aur Woh Box Office Collection) par 7-9 karod ke bich kamai kar legi
 Critics of acting of all the actors including Kartik Aaryan have praised
 is film kii kahani chintu tyaagi yani karthik aryan kii he
 Karthik Aryan is an obedient son and a public servant
 karthik aryan kii shaadi vedika yani bhoomi pednekar (bhumi Pednekar) ke saath ho jaati he, or shaadi ke kuch samay baad karthik aryan ko jindagi beras lagane lagati he
 With this, there is an entry in the life of Kartik Aryan, of the austere penance i
e
 Ananya Panday
 karthik apane jivan ke khote hue romaanch ko ananyaa ke saath dobaaraa jinda karne kii koshish karte hai, or is tarah pati or patni kii simple life main wo kii entry ho jaati he
 The story of the film 'pati Patni Aur Woh (pati Patni Aur Woh)' has been kept simple by the director Mudassar Aziz and he has tried to make it as per today's era
 film main acting ke morche par sabhi kalakaar khare utarate hai
 Kartik Aaryan has played the character of Chintu Tyagi with full vigor, though he may be stuck a bit, but the director has also taken advantage of his monologue skill
 bhoomi pednekar to yah pehle hi siddh kar chuki hai ki vah kisi bhi kirdaar ko parade par bakhubi nibhaa sakati hai
 This is definitely the second film of Ananya Panday but he has improved a lot

 Shehla Rashid, an ex-jnu student and leader of the Jammu and Kashmir People's Movement, has again come into controversy
 is baar vajah bani hai shehla kii ore se kashmir main nakaabandi ke dauraan atyaachaar kaa aarope lagaate hue kiye gaye twit
 In the case against him, a Supreme Court lawyer also filed a police complaint on Monday
 lekin ek din baad shehla ne kaha he ki wo apni baat par kaayam hai or iskaa saboot bhi sarkaar or sena ko saunp dengi
 Shehla also said in response to the question that if my allegations are proved true, will the army take action? Shehla told India Today, "the militancy will increase
 log pehle se hi laapata ho rahe hai, aatanki sanghathanon main shaamil ho rahe hai
 With the repeal of Article 370, there will be no development
 uske liye hamen logon ko saath lenaa hoga
 Shehla said, "the main issue is the removal of Article 370, the way voices are being suppressed there
" aisi sthiti main meri ghati main asal logon se baat hui he
 He told me about the excesses being committed by the security forces
 or ye wo log nahin hai jo afvaahen failaate hai
 These are real Kashmiris who are facing the Kop
 ’shehla se jab unke daavon ko lekar saboot ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, ‘kya hoga agar main saboot ke saath saamne aati hum
 It is not important
 asal baat he ki jo thodaa kuch bhi kashmiri ab kah rahe hai use bhi bebuniyaad bataa kar khaarij kiya ja rahaa he
 What evidence does the army have that my allegations are false? The army should be allowed to conduct a fair investigation
 main unke saamne gavaahi duungi
 They will hand over all the evidence with complete information
 lekin agar ye sab sach sabit hua to kya sena in sabhi logon kaa courtmarshall karegi?’shehla ne kaha ki ‘hamane dekha tha ki ek major ne kaise sena ke esaopi ko todaa tha or kaise use sammanit kiya gaya
 Therefore, my evidence does not matter much
 sena jyaadati kar rahi he
 This is not new
 ’shehla ne ghati main paabandiyon ko lekar kaha, “main un patrakaron ko jaanati hum jinke camere police ne chin liye
 Kashmiris are actively prevented from recording anything
 meraa chachera bhai downtaun (puraane shahar) se laut kar aayaa he, usne mujhe bataaya he ki suraksha balon ne unke gharon main todphod kii
 What the government is doing right now is committing a gross violation of human rights by closing the communication lines
 ’shehla ne doharaaya, ‘mere aarope logon kii asal gavaahiyon par aadhaarit hai
 If the government opens the communication lines then all these will come out
 bhartiya sena ke khilaaf bolne kaa meraa koi nihit swaarth nahin he
 The important thing to note is that after the police complaint yesterday, the investigation was handed over to the Special Cell
 ’shehla ne kaha ki unki party ne hameshaa kashmiri panditon ke punarvaas ko praathamikta di he
 Shehla said, "I also want them to come back
" lekin is tarah ke halaat main shanti kaise sambhav he
 Where the government had to lie to Amarnath travelers, tourists, students
 yadi sarkaar kah rahi he ki (anuchhed 370) hataane se kashmiri panditon ko (ghati main) waapas aane kaa mauka milegaa, to asal main wo kise murkh bana rahi he?”shehla ke mutabik ‘(anuchhed 370) radd karne se vikaas nahin hoga or log yahaan nahin aaenge kyonki ye conflict jone he
 For this, we have to take people along
 pakistan ko bhi agar aisa lagata he
 Kashmir issue should be resolved
 thopa gaya vikaas kabhi falphul nahin saktaa
 Everyone wants peace but not in this way
 ’aapke twits se kya hinsa ko badhaava nahin milegaa? is sawaal ke jawaab main shehla ne kaha, ‘mere twit hinsa ko kaise nyotaa de rahe hai
 People do not have access to them in the valley
 ye sashastr balon ke ection hai jo hinsa ko uksaa rahe hai
 We are not going to leave the truth for anything
 puure sach ko saamne aane den
 And i am not giving any additional information, all this is what the Kashmiri people already know
