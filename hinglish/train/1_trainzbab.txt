dilli kii haalat bhale hi chennai kii tarah kharaab nahin he magar kai ilaakon main avaidh borwell ke kaaran bhumigat jal kam hota ja rahaa he
 It is going to have very poor effect in some areas by next year
 pani kii kami ke kaaran dilli ko jitna pani chahie utana nahin mil paa rahaa he
 Water is needed at 1140 million gallons per day but getting 936 million gallons per day
 ham bhale hi bhumigat jal se dilli main pani kaa sankat dur kar rahe hai magar yah bada sankat lekar aane vaala he
 Last year, the Delhi Jal Board admitted that there are more than 5000 points where water is extracted illegally
 inamen se kuch ko bain bhi kiya gaya he
 Delhi still has many opportunities to save water
 If Ram goes on trust in this way, then the crisis will deepen
 dilli sarkaar ne 201 jalaashyon ko punajivit karne kii niti banaai he
 There were once more than 300 ponds in the capital Delhi
 vaise jin ilaakon main dilli kii badi aabaadi rahati he vahaan april ke maheene main log is tarah se pani nikaal kar pi rahe the
 When the pressure of the water pipe is low, then people have made a pit in the bottom of the drain in which the water fills and then remove the water from it and place it in the vessel
 barish ke dinon main is gadde main naalee kaa pani bhar jaataa he
 If this water crisis is not seen on TV, then we assume that there is no water crisis in Delhi
 is vakt bharat main kitne sabmarsible pump lag rahe hai isaki jaankaree kisi ke paas nahin he
 According to the World Bank report, India is the largest underground water drain country in the world
 duniya main jitna bhi bhumigat jal he uskaa 25 pratishat har saal bharat nikaalata he
 That is, it takes out 2
5 million liters of water from the ground
 sarkaar ke nigam to zamin se pani nikaal hi rahe hai, avaidh rup se bhi pani nikaal kar jagah jagah bechaa ja rahaa he
 This business has spread rapidly in the villages
 2018 kii hi ek khabar mili times of india kii
 The Ludhiana Municipal Corporation was surveying how many submersibles are running without licenses and fees, then it was found that more than 4000 submersibles are running without any license
 is shahar main 2010 se sabmarsible par bain laga he
 This was banned by court order
 agar aap ise lagaayenge to nigam kii 23 sadasyon kii kamity vichaar karti he or anumati detii he
 This process is obviously hardened so that water is not wasted
 magar iske baad bhi 4000 se adhik sabmarsible avaidh rup se chal rahe the
 This shows that our urban society neither cares about rules nor water if it gets a chance
 ab aate hai bihar
 Our colleague Pramod Gupta has worked hard to bring these pictures of submersible pumps to you today
 pramod aaj darbhanga ke lakshmi sagar, katahalwari mohalla or chapki gaye
 He noticed that work is underway to install submersible pumps at eight places
 kahin mashin se sabmarsible lagaaya ja rahaa he to kahin haath kii mashin se yani puraane tareeke se
 If this is the average of one day, then you can estimate that 2 to 3 thousand submersible pumps would have been installed in and around Darbhanga city in the last three months
 log apni taraf se dhadadhad sabmarsible pump lagaae ja rahe hai
 For this they are also spending from 75000 to one lakh
 yahi nahin sarkaar bhi yahaan ke vaardon main kareeb 150 sabmarsible pump lagava rahi he taaki logon ke gharon tak pani pahunchaaya ja sake
 On seeing these machines, you can be satisfied that if water has been provided for a few years, it will decrease if we exploit the ground water
 kai rajyon main yah dekha gaya he ki baadh yaa barish ke kaaran jitna bhumigat jal richarge hota he usase kahin zyada log zamin se pani nikaal kar istamaal kar lete hai
 Politically, this decision may be right, but the submersible is creating a new crisis for Bihar or for the whole of India
 aapako ek or baat bataanaa chaahate hai ek sabmarsible pump lagane ke liye pehle 30 se 40 hazaar litre pani lagata he
 Submersible pumps require continuous watering
 yah pani kahaan se aata he
 Must be illegal
 jahaan pani bachaa khuchaa hoga vahaan se aata hoga
 In Darbhanga, water is coming at 250 feet but in many places of Bihar the water has gone below three hundred feet
 muzaffarpur, patna, vaishali main pani 300 feet neeche ja chukaa he
 Corporations across Bihar are not accounted for, but the number of rural wards is close to 1
25 million
 sabhi sava lakh panchayat ward main sabmarsible lagaaya jayega
 By next year, lakhs of submersibles would have been installed in the land of Bihar
 jis mohalle main sabmarsible lag rahaa tha, usee ke paas kaa he yah palatu talab
 This pond is filled with hyacinth but there is water left
 yah jo pipe dekh rahe hai iske zarie pani khinchakar sabmarsible pump kii mashin main daalaa jaataa he taaki vah pani nikaal sake
 If you calculate this, how many thousands of pumps are being installed in Bihar and where forty thousand liters of water is coming for each pump, then you will be scared
 magar chintaa mat kiijie
 As long as there is a facility to send goodmorning to whatsapp, then you will have nothing
 report dekhakar pareshaan na ho balki dhanyavad den ki is bhayaavah sankat ke bich aap mouj kar rahe hai
 Pond pine and Chaur have to be saved
 logon ko bataanaa hoga ki sabmarsible pump laga liye hai to aap pani ke maalik nahin ho jate hai
 Water has to be used accordingly
 varanaa aaj to kaam chal rahaa he, kal kaa nahin chalegaa
 It is only part of the people of Bihar who have taken possession of the ponds and are building houses
 sarkaar se to sab ummid karte hai kya logon se ummid kii ja sakati he ve khud bataa den ki talab par kabza kar unhone ghar banaaya he
 No
 tab yah sankat kabhi dur nahin hoga
 This is the green pond of Darbhaga
 abhi bachaa hua he magar iske bade hisse par kabza ho gaya he
 Think its 1000 feet width
 magar purab or dakshin ke hisse main kaaphi dur tak kabza kar liya he
 The same situation is with other ponds
 atikaraman karne waalon ko aap pani ke sankat par 500 program dikhaa den wo hans kar chal denge
 They know that the program does not remove the possession
 unhen hi nahin, hamen bhi yah pataa he
 The ground water recharges after rain or flood, but the water is not recharged at the speed at which we are using ground water
 jitna richarge hota he usase kahin zyaada pani ham istemaal kar rahe hai
 Policy Research Studies PRS had prepared a report in 2016 based on the Central Ground Board report
 iske anusaar 10 rajyon main bhumigat jal main arsenic paaya jaataa he jisase cancer, diabetes, dil kii beemaari vagairah hoti he
 Found in water at a level of 20–100 m
 kya is pani ko ham saaf kar logon tak de rahe hai
 When the NITI Aayog report says that 70 percent water is polluted
 ab to sarkaar bhi maanati he ki har saal pradooshit pani se bharat main do lakh log mar jate hai
 More than 500 deaths occur every day
 modi sarkaar ne is baar jal shakti mantralay banaaya he
 Its minister is Gajendra Singh Shekhawat
 9 june ko inhone press conference main kaha he ki kai rajya aise hai jahaan saaf pani yani pine kaa pani 5 pratishat se bhi kam he
 Bihar is one of them
 bihar main pine kaa pani maatr 5 pratishat he
 Agar Malwa of Madhya Pradesh
 aap jahaan colony banate hue dekh rahe hai darasal uske neeche ek talab he
 Only a few years ago people saw the pond here
 jila mukhyalay se bahut dur nahin tha yah talab
 The trespassing scientists made this pond disappear
 barish ke dinon main jab yah bharta tha tab aas paas ke ilaakon kaa jal str bad jaataa tha
 Now there is a small pit named after the pond, in which the dirty water of the drains accumulates
 jab hamaare sahyogi jafar multani ne sarkari dastavezon ko tatola to pataa chalaa ki ricard main yah talab ek hectare ilaake main he
 Where the administration had to remove the encroachment, on the contrary, it made roads here, installed water pipelines, installed electric poles
 yahaan par pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke tahat kai saare makaan bhi banawaye
 But no one went to the record room and saw where the pond that was here went
 kai baar log kehete hai ki pani kii samasya par logon ko jaagruk kiijie to hamane jaagruk kar diya ab aap bataaiye kya colector is talab kaa atikaraman hatwa saktaa he
 Keep taking long deep breaths
 aaj yoga diwas bhi he
 Umrao Bai is telling the story of this pond
 talab khatm ho chukaa he
 People have built houses by filling it
 ab vahi log privet tankeron se pani mangava rahe hai
 300 rupees is being given by a tanker
 nagarpalika yahaan teen din main ek baar pani kii supplai karata he
 Now you tell
 kise samajhaayenge
 To the government, to the administration or to the people
 talab bhar kar log pani kharid rahe hai
 i am telling you all this that if you want now nothing will happen
 niti ayog bhi kahegaa, pradhanmantri bhi kahenge, pani ke visheshgy bhi kahenge lekin logon se lekar sarkaron tak ne jo talab bhare hai kya wo ab waapas aa sakate hai
 The only solution to the water crisis is its TV coverage
 ek din tivi kawarej se bhi aap ub jaaenge
 Political parties will free the tanker to win the election but the tankers will also dry up one day
 ab dekhie is jagah kaa naam he bas stand kii talai
 Talai means pond only
 6 saal pehle tak log yahaan talab dekha karte the
 Now there is encroachment here
 shoping kamplex ban chukaa he
 Nobody thought that rain water accumulates in such places
 jameen ke bheetar jaataa he jo shahar ke hi kaam aata he
 But where will the water come from if the city settles at the place of water
 media ke kawarej se pani nahin aayega
 The government has made rules that the reservoirs cannot be destroyed, now whether the government can take these rules and break these constructions
 agar vah pani bachaane ko lekar gambhir he to ek is tarah ke sarkari or privet atikaraman hataa kar dikhaa de
 This place is a pond in the government document
 to sarkaar apni jagah waapas le le
 Then you believe that a government is serious about resolving the water crisis
 jin logon ko lagata he ki pani ko lekar jaagrukta kii kami he vah bas internet par jal sankat likhen
 Thousands of articles will be found
 use padhein or jaagruk ho jaaen
 Then explain what they want to do after becoming aware
 kya unki jaagrukta atikaraman ke neeche dabe talabon ko waapas laa sakati he
 Can not bring yaad rakhiegaa pradooshit pani pine se bharat main har din 550 log mar jate hai or saal main do lakh log mar jate hai
 See this part of Zafar Multani's report
 yah raatadiya talab he
 There is a tomb on its side, there is a temple as well
 48 bighas main yah talab failaa tha
 Made over a thousand years ago
 tab aabaadi kam thi magar talab kitna bada banaaya gaya
 Now the population has eaten the pond itself
 48 bighas kaa yah talab sikud gaya he
 Encroachment has been removed from here, but the drainage water continued to get in its water for years
 is kaaran iskaa pani anupayogi ho chukaa he
 People cannot tolerate the smell coming out of the water
 isliye yah jhooth he ki jaagrukta kii kami se yah sankat he
 Actually the people who occupied the ponds were very aware people
 unhen pataa tha ki aane vaale samay main insaan whatsap se ji jayega, pani kii zarurat nahin hogi isliye usne bekaar talabon ko bhar kar ghar bana liye
 To understand these lines, look at the program twice
 noeda main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kafile main suraksha chook ko lekar esaspi gautamabuddha nagar ne dancor thane main tainaat ek sab inspector or ek consteble ko nilambit kar diya he
 Both of them were in a pilot car during pm's Noida visit on 25 December and pm's convoy turned in the wrong direction

 While returning from the public meeting to return to the helipad at the Botanical Garden, his convoy wandered on the Noida Expressway

 The woman has stated that she 'made false allegations against him due to frustration and depression

 The licensing of land in Haryana and their monkeys are not hidden from anyone, especially after exposing the collusion of Robert Vadra and DLF of IAS officer Ashok Khemka and many big companies were also questioned
 lekin ab ek or gambhir maamla saamne aayaa he
 In Haryana, the CAG started auditing land related matters, even stating that the Department of Country and Town Planning is not cooperating, but suddenly the CAG has closed its audit
 dastavej kah rahe hai kii ye audit dilli ke sieji offis se aae adeshon par band kiya gaya he
 Also, many questions are also arising on their own due to not being told the reason for closure
 iees adhikari or us samay ke chakbandi nideshak ashok khemka ne robert wadra jameen cese ke baad kai aise keson kaa hawala diya tha jinamein kaaphi aniyamitataayen pai gai thim or jinamein ghotaalon kaa shaq jaahir kiya gaya tha
 Khemka himself had demanded that all these cases be audited by the CAG and this demand was not only accepted by the CAG at that time but also started working on it
 lekin isi saal june main dilli sieji ne chandigarh sthit principal auditor general ko ye audit rokane ke liye kaha he
 You can also read it yourself, as of now Khemka's lawyers and law experts have been surprised at this issue
 khemka ke vakil anupam gupta ne kaha, 'ek jaanch ko shuru karnaa or phir band kar dena kaaphi ascharyajanak he, lekin sieji bhi javabdeh he
 According to the information of the constitution, i feel that the CAG should answer why this has been done
 'aisi bhi jaankaree he ki sieji ne is saare maamle kii jaanch ke samay ye bhi kaha tha ki haryana ke country or toun planning vibhaag kii taraf se puraa sahyog nahin mil rahaa he or audit main dikkatein aa rahi hai, lekin achaanak aisa kya hua ki puure maamle kii jaanch ko roak hi diya gaya
 At present, neither the Haryana government nor the CAG is saying anything on this matter

 During this, PM Modi, without naming, targeted the previous Congress governments and said that political parties which remained in power for decades did not work to advance women
 unhone kaha, 'hamaari sarkaar mahilaon ko aarthik rup se swalambi banane ke saath-saath unke swasthya par bhi vishesh dhyaan de rahi he
 Health of the people has been given such priority in our government
 mahilaon or bacchon ke swasthya or poshan par khaastaur par dhyaan diya ja rahaa he
 PM Modi said, 'we are working to take the country in the direction where there is no delivery outside the hospital

 But do you know that during the first six months of the newborn, there is an increased risk of type 1 diabetes in children due to respiratory tract infections such as cold-cough, flu, tocil, phlegm cough and pneumonia

 The findings of this research state that the first six months of children are important for the development of the immune system in their body, which fights diseases like type 1 diabetes (TID)

 com / pczxwdntg5ghosh ne 12 kalakaaron kaa party main swaagat karte hue kaha ki rajya ke log pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv or vikaas kaaryon se prerit hai
 The artists joining the BJP include Parno Moitra, Rishi Kaushik, Kanchana Moitra, Rupanjana Mitra and Vishwajit Ganguly
 (input agenciyon se) Yogendra Yadav, who caused huge trouble for the party by offering to resign from all AAP posts, said that his intention was to promote "cleanliness" or "introspection" in the inexperienced party
 india today ke associat editor asit jolly ke saath unki baatcheet ke kuch anshahyah dharna bad rahi he ki aap kai khemon main bant gai he-ek gut kejariwal ke prati nishtha rakhata he, kuch aapke prati or ek prashanth bhushan jaise tulanaatmak rup se kam mukhar sadasyon kaa he?bahut se log chaahate hai ki aap bharat kii dharti se gaayab ho jaae
 It is because of this longing that such an image of the party has been created in the media
 duniya main aisi koi party nahin he jisamen bhinn vichaar na hon or jisamen log aantarik samaayojan kaa prayaas na karte hon taaki ek-duusare se sahamat ho saken
 It can be expected even more in a party like AAP because it has people from different ideological backgrounds and experiences
 pehle shajia ilmi baahar chali gayi
 Now you have written a letter questioning Kejriwal's leadership
 kya aap ke sanyojak ke rup main kejariwal kaa rahanaa ab tarksangat nahin he?mere letters se yah bilkul saaf he ki main arvind ke netritv par sawaal nahin khadey kar rahaa
 i have warned colleagues about the trend that exists in this country and in our political culture
 ham vyakti puja karne lagate hai, jisamen rajnatik takat ko ghataakar use vyaktigat takat tak simit kar dene kii sahaj pravriti hoti he
 i had raised some questions about the fundamentals
 zyaadaatar masalon par rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main charchaa hui
 Shazia Ilmi had raised similar issues, but no action was taken then? i replied to Shazia on behalf of the party
 party ne aadhikarik rup se yah sweekaar kiya ki unki chintaaen vaazib or vaid hai
 We had asked them to wait till the party's national executive meeting so that their concerns could be considered collectively
 kaaryakarini ne sarvasammati se prastaav paarit kar unase waapas lautne kaa anurodh kiya he
 Did not all these activists and volunteers create confusion? It is possible that our volunteers could not get clear signals from the party leadership till a few days after the election
 isse unke manobal par asar padaa hoga
 In the National Executive meeting, a clear roadmap was prepared for the party to move forward
 sabhi nakaaratmak baaten jameendoj ho gayi

 upi main kya mahagathbandhan main na hokar bhi congress mahagathbandhan kaa saath de rahi he
 This question arose today because Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi has claimed that her party has fielded only candidates who are either winning or defeating BJP
 priyanka gandhi ke is bayaan ke baad bijepi ne congress ko votakatwa party qaraar de diya
 Priyanka Gandhi's statement was followed by many more people's statements
 purv samaajawaadee party ke netaa amar singh ne kaha ki 'congress kii netaa (priyanka) kah rahi hai ki ham unki (gathbandhan) madad kar rahe hai
 This means Abdullah Deewana at the Begani wedding
 amar singh ne yah bhi kaha ki 'priyanka ji kaa main kaaphi sammaan karata hum
 i have heard many of his speeches
 ve raajnneetik virodh karti hai or unhone khulkar kaha he ki congress bijepi kaa vot kaatane ke liye chunaav lard rahi he
 She has openly accepted that the Congress is fighting not to win this election but to defeat one party
 ye sakaaratmak raajnneeti nahin he lekin main unki spashtvaadita kaa prabal samarthak hum
 During a discussion on Aaj Tak, when Amar Singh was asked if the Congress was playing the role of Votkatwa, he said, 'this is not happening for the first time in politics, even before Samajwadi Party once as the largest party in Uttar Pradesh Had emerged in tab usko rokane ke liye bhaajapa ne sabase choti party kii mayawati ko mukhyamantri pad se nawaja tha
 As a result of this, today, Mayawati ji is emerging and is harming the BJP itself
 'amar singh ne kaha, 'nakaaratmak raajnneeti koi bhi kare chaahe ateet main bhaajapa ne kiya ho yaa vartmaan main congress kar rahi ho, uske nattejey achche nahin hote
 This means that where is the mango of the sown tree acacia
 rampur main nurbano kii jagah hindu pratyaashee isliye diya gaya taaki hindu maton kaa vibhaajan ho jisase bhaajapa ko nuksaan pahunche lekin bhaajapa ko koi nuksaan nahin hua
 Because the river drains falling adversely to the running stream have no effect
 unhone kaha ki congress ye chunaav jeetne ke liye nahin balki kisi khaas party ko haraane ke liye lard rahi he
 Significantly, in the analysis of India Today Group, it was also clear that there are 44 seats in 52, on which the Congress and the Grand Alliance strategy may harm the BJP
 aise main priyanka gandhi kaa bayaan kaaphi ahm he jisamen unhone kaha ki jahaan ham majboot hai vahaan ham jeetenge lekin jahaan ham kamjor hai vahaan bijepi ko haraane ke liye keval bijepi ke vot kaatane ke liye ummidavaar khadey kiye hai
 India Today Group's data intelligence unit, ie diu, had already revealed in its analysis that the Congress is indeed helping the SP-BSP alliance in UP
 upi kii 80 main se 52 loksabhaa siton par diu ne analysis kii
 The Congress and the Grand Alliance of UP have not fielded candidates against each other's veterans in 8 seats
 ye siten hai-mujffarnagar, bagpat, mainpuri, firozabad, azamgarh, kannauj, raibareli or amethi
 In the remaining 44 seats out of 52, diu's analysis has revealed that the Congress has fielded 34 candidates from castes who have been traditional BJP voters
 inamen se 17 congress ke ummidavaar brahman, rajput, vaisya, jat yaa anya savarna jatiyon ke hai
 In 2014, more than 70 percent of these voters voted for the BJP
 DIU ne apni analysis main paaya he ki congress ke 28 ummidavaar bijepi ke liye mushkil khadi kar rahe hai
 While 16 Congress candidates are becoming a challenger to the grand alliance candidates
 kul milakar 52 main se hi 36 siten aisi hai jahaan congress or mahagathbandhan kii ranneeti bijepi ke khilaaf kaam kar rahi he
 However, during the election campaign, BSP President Mayawati and SP President Akhilesh have also strongly attacked the Congress

 agle maheene hamaare pradhanmantri or japani pradhanmantri shinjo abe milakar mumbai-ahmedabad bullate train kii aadharshila rakhenge, jisaki raftaar 350 kilometre pratighanta hogi
 Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu has said that by 2023, it will start running between ahmedabad-mumbai
 lekin saamaanya trainon kii durghatnaayen kab rukengi, is par koi kuch nahin bolta
 The opposition wants to show the mirror to the Modi government by counting 27 rail accidents, 259 passengers killed, 899 injured

 lekin is nirdesh kaa paalan ho nahin rahaa he
 What is not ironic is that the running trains do not have enough resources to replace the old traditional coaches and are dreaming of a bullet train! Also read: First Quarter GDP 6 with slight improvement

 It is believed that the accident took place in a populated area and without waiting for the administration, the angelic locals started the relief work without losing time, otherwise the death toll could reach more than 25

 Then why do passengers suffer due to human defaults or the cost of the system? Are sensors, lasers, infrared, night vision cameras, 4G, Rail Tail, better connectivity connectivity to protect the rail track? Can the Railways, which earns crores of rupees daily from software through passengers, not devise such technology for track tracking? Is it not necessary to develop a secure, sensitive robust reconciliation system between engine and track? Hopefully! The existing trains would have been safe before the bullet

 The Central Government has been instructed to ensure that such statements do not come from those in responsible positions before getting clearance from CBFC
 court ne aarope lagaaya ki aise bayanon kii vajah se film ke khilaaf maahaul ban rahaa he
 Why did the Supreme Court have to make such a comment? In fact, during the ongoing controversy over Padmavati, Union Ministers, mps, Chief Ministers of several states gave controversial statements
 kuch netaaon ne padmavati ke nirdeshak sanjay lila bhansaali or actress deepika padukon ke sir or naak kaatane kii dhamkee di

 He however criticized Deepika for threatening to bite her nose

 Yogi Adityanath UP CM Yogi had said, Bhansali is equally responsible for the protests and threats against the film
 unhen logon kii bhaawanaaon se khilne kii aadat ho chuki he
 He said, action should be taken against the filmmakers along with the protesters in this dispute
 kisi ko bhi kanoon apane haath main lene kaa adhikaar nahin he

 Like films, in politics, the hero needs a villain to become a hero
 or is vakt dilli chunaavon ke ain pehle aam aadmi party ko bhi usee villen kii talash he
 The last time elections were held in Delhi, a villain named Kejriwal and his party were given the opportunity to become the heroes that the public was looking for
 janata ko yaqiin tha ki congress or bijepi jaise aazamaae ja chuke hero kii bajaay is nae hero main hit hone kaa madda zyada he
 The result was in front of everyone
 lekin is baar tasviir alag he
 This time there is a lack of villain in Delhi in front of Kejriwal and his Aam Aadmi Party
 congress ko janata pehle hi nakaar chuki he or aise main muqabla bijepi or aap ke bich mana ja rahaa he
 The problem of the Aam Aadmi Party is that their stunt of resignation failed in 49 days while trying to change from hero to superhero
 wo super hero to nahin bane lekin in chunaavon ke liye bijepi ko wo villen de diya jiske boote wo janata ko yakeen dilaane main juty he ki wo hi unki asli rahanuma he
 That is, the issue with the BJP is to give a permanent government
 49 din main sarkaar na chhod dene kaa
 But the corruption of Aam Aadmi Party, Congress can no longer be counted and where can BJP be counted
 aise main aap ab ek villen paidaa kar rahi he
 Now its attempt is to make the BJP a villain by making the tension of Trilokpuri an issue
 lekin ye ranneeti bijepi ko hi raas aane vaali he kyonki agar isse dhruvikaran tej hua to trilokapuri ke garib badi aasaani se hindu−musalmaan main bant jaaenge
 However, this strategy has two problems
 ek to ye ki aisa karke wo bijepi ko dhruvikaran kaa or mauka de rahi he or doosraa ye ki wo apane 49 din kii sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon se fokas shift karne kaa mauka baithe bithaye virodhiyon ko de rahi he
 Although hoardings have been put up raising the question of comparing 49 days vs
 150 days of work, Kejriwal and his party have to understand that their strategy should reach not only hoardings but also the entire election
 aam aadmi party alag raajnneeti karne kaa daawa karti he or agar wo is chunaav kaa villen talashne kii bajaay khud ke kaam kaa prachaar zyada kare or usee ke aadhaar par vot maange to wo bijepi ko kah paaegi ki pikchar abhi baaqi he mere dost

 Even though Cook needed only 32 runs to break Graham Gooch's record of scoring the most Test runs for England, he said his mentor could never be equaled
 newjiland ke khilaaf pehle test match main 162 ran banane vaale cook ko gooch ke 8,900 test ran ko peeche chhodane ke liye ab keval 32 ran chahie
 If he does so, he will reach this position in the 114th match while Gooch played 118 matches for it but he had to face the all-time great bowlers in his entire career
 cook ne hedingle main patrakaron se kaha, ‘yah yaadgaar kshan hoga
 The level of player he was, i don't even find myself close to him but it would be a great moment
 cook jab kishor the tab unhone gooch se ballebaaji ke gur siikhe the or unhone kaha ki gooch kii madad ke bina vah aaj is mukaam par nahin hote
 'he said,' i would not have been able to reach here without Gooch's help so it would be a little strange that i would leave his record behind because without his hard work and dedication towards me i would not have been able to score even half the runs that i have made
 ’cook ne kaha, ‘yah thodaa ajeeb hoga lekin graham gooch ek hi hoga
 He is England's all-time great batsman

 We are saying this because Pakistan's Democracy Index has fallen by 10% in the last 5 years
 duniya ko dikhaane ke liye pakistan main bhale hi chunaav hua or imran khan pradhanmantri bane lekin iconomist intelligence unit (EIU) kii demokrasi index bataati he ki pakistan main loktantr pehle se zyada kamjor hua he
 We compared the last five years of Pakistan's Democracy Index (the state of democracy in any country) with annual terrorist incidents and found that whenever democracy in Pakistan has weakened, terrorist incidents have increased in Kashmir
 kamjor padate loktantr or aatank ke rishte ko samajhane ke liye hamane 2014 se lekar 2018 tak ke demokrasi index kii tulana kii
 The Democracy Index is an index that states the state of democracy in one hundred and fifty countries of the world, including India and Pakistan
 alag-alag paimaane ke hisaab se har desh ko ek se lekar das tak ke bich number diya jaataa he
 a low number is considered a bad and high number is a better democracy
 iconomist intelligence unit (EIU) ke mutabik pakistan kaa demokrasi index 2014 main 4

 During this time, the terrorist incidents in Kashmir have also increased rapidly

 Five years ago, Pakistan's democracy slipped from 108 to 112 in the Global Ranking
 yah giravat bataati he ki keval chunaav karana loktantr nahin he
 Pakistan's democracy has not yet been liberated from military officers and puppets
 aisa isliye he ki ye kathmulle yani dharmik manyataon kii aalochana(blasafemi) ko aparaadh ghoshit karne or mahilaon ke adhikaron ko simit karne vaale kanoonon ko aasaani se paas karvaa lete hai
 The nexus between the army and the puppets has always targeted Kashmir
 darasal pakistan ke loktantr par sainik taanaashaahon or dharmik netaaon kaa bada hissaa hameshaa se haaavee rahaa he
 This big and powerful faction does not leave any chance to cash in on Kashmir and for this they do not shy away from digging the foundation of their democracy
 pakistan main chunaav ke dauraan jabardast dhaandhlee or bhrashtachar aam he or yahi demokrasi index main giravat kii sabase badi vajah bataai gai he
 In the recent elections where Imran Khan's Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf Party defeated the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (nawaz)
 vipakshi partiyon ke bade paimaane par dhaandhlee ke aaropon ke baad yah tanatani or bad gai
 The candidature of former Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif was rejected by the Supreme Court after the invocation after the nomination in the Panama Papers

 Musharraf further said that the terror attacks will not stop until India resolves the 'core' issue of Kashmir

 Whenever India has raised the demand for Pakistan to blacklist Masood Azhar, the chief of jaish-e-mohammed responsible for the terrorist attack, China has slammed these efforts by using veto power in the UN Security Council
 yani ek baat saaf he jahaan loktantr kamjor hoga wo desh apni galatiyon or kamajoriyon ko chhipaane ke liye duusare deshon main gadabadi failaane kaa sahaara legaa, isliye bahut jaruri he ki loktantr ko majboot kiya jaae
 What is the Democracy Index? The Economist Intelligence Unit generates survey reports on the state of democracy in 165 countries every year
 mote taur par deshon ko chaar category main baanta gaya he-“full democracy”, “flawed democracy”, “hybrid regime” and “authoritarian regime”
 a country with a score of more than 8 in the index between one to ten is placed in the full democracy criterion
 agar koi desh 6 se zyada or 8 se kam suchakank paata he to use “flawed democracy”main rakhaa jaataa he
 India and the United States of America are placed in this category in the 2018 Democracy Index
 6 yaa isse kam lekin 4 se zyada suchakank vaale deshon ko hybrid regime main rakhaa gaya he
 Pakistan's democracy falls under this category
 4 yaa isse kam suchakank vaale deshon ko authoritarian regime” main jagah di gai he

 Sisodia, an alternative arrangement for children, responded in the assembly saying that the list of such schools has been prepared after the order by the High Court

 If any school is running without recognition, then challan is also deducted, however no such information of number is available to the school and children

 There will be many challenges before the new government
 pehali baat yah ki khajaana khaali he
 The primary challenge will be to raise resources to continue some of the public welfare schemes launched between 2014 and 2019 of the TDP government in the same form or with some changes and fulfill the 'navratnalu' promises made during its campaign

 The political friendship of the YSRC with the Narendra Modi government in Delhi will determine the future of funds flow to the state and Jagan's promise to give Andhra Pradesh a special state status

 The Telugu Desam Party under Chandrababu Naidu failed to achieve this status from the Modi government

 For this reason, Jagan had announced before the results that the YSRC would support the same party at the center which is ready to give special state status to Andhra

 Based on the possibilities, no conclusion can be drawn that Muslims did not offer Namaz there between 1528-1856, as the site was under the rule of the Mughals and later the Nawabs during this time

 Click to know the score of the match, Shane Watson was declared man of the match for his brilliant innings
 watasan ne 94 ranon kii pari to kheli hi saath hi ek wicket bhi hasil karne main kaamyaab rahe
 Both the Australian openers bowled well
 ek samay to aisa lag rahaa tha ki australia yah match 10 wicket se jeet jaaegi lekin canadai gendbaajon ne aisa hone nahin diya
 Watson's aggression can be gauged from the fact that he hit a six and four fours in the 28th and Patel's first over
 hadine ne bhi isi kaa anukaran karte hue agle hi over main jon davisan ke over main ek chaukaa or ek chakka jamaaya lekin vah paanchavin gend par out ho gayi

 davisan bhi lay main aa gayi, unhone lee kii gend par cover chaukaa jadaa or phir midwicket par bhi gend seemaa rekha ke paar karaayi
 However, Lee's slow bouncer ended the 40-year-old's innings

 But Watson took an easy catch at third man to end his innings

 Captain Ashish Bagai and Zubin Surkari also wanted to maintain the momentum started by Patel, but thanks to Watson, Australia kept pace at the run pace, losing just 13 runs in their first spell of four overs

 ab is khabar par unki pratikriya ai hai
 
 "modi agar pradhanmantri ban gaye to desh chhod duungi"shabana aazmi This is pure FABRICATION
 Ive never said this and i have no intentions of leaving the country
 This is where i was born and this is where Ill die
 i hve nothing but contempt for The Fake News Brigade

 Shabana Azmi wrote: "I have never said so and i have no intention of leaving the country
 isi jagah meraa janm hua or yaheen par meri mrityu hogi
 
 
 
 ''the Fake News Brigade is pretty pathetic
 Their overdrive exposes their fear at losing out
 Issues pe baat kar nahi sakte tto chalo jhoot itni baar bolo ke usey log sach maan lein is their motto
 But they r falling flat on their faces bcoz there r enuf brave voices exposing dem Shabana Azmi followed by another tweet: "the condition of the Fake News Brigade is very pathetic and since they cannot talk about the issues , So they repeatedly spread lies so that people believe them to be true
 " shabana azmi (68) ne kaha ki unke pita caphi azmi ne unhen sikhaaya tha ki apane virodhiyon se kabhi bhi shatruon kii tarah vyavhaar na karen
 There are a lot of reactions on Shabana Azmi's tweet
 bachche hai
 Even this is marginalized
 lekin jo shelter home ke bachche hai,ve to bhayaavah pidaa ko pehle hi bhoga chuke hote hai
 a child who enters a shelter home has hundreds of darun stories
 maamla ladakiyon kaa ho,tab inamen pidaa kii ek parat ko or jod lijie
 In these dreadful situations, if you have been mistreated in the name of giving shelter, then think in which society we are living
 dukh-bhay-pidaa kii ek vicitra-si avasthaa main apni havas ko anjaam dene kaa aisa kaam koi manushya to nahin hi kar saktaa he
 Then who are those people, how is this time and who is guilty of it? 
 
 ? kya vahi,jo yah kar rahaa he,yaa vah bhi,jo aisa hote hue dekh rahe hai,maun
 Why the latest case of Muzaffarpur is not able to create anger in our mind
 
 
 ?aakrosh to is baat par bhi paidaa nahin hota ki hindustan ne15saal ke andar bacchon ke maamalon main kiye gaye aparaadhon ko889pratishat tak badha liya he
 In the year 2001, NCRB reported 10,814 cases of crimes against children, which increased to 1,06,958 by 2016
 kya khub tarakkee kii he
 
 
 ! kuch saal pehle chhattisgarh ke jhaliyamari adivasee ashram shaala main ek vicitra maamla saamne aayaa tha
 The wardens of hostels in this tribal-dominated area sexually abused many girls in turn, stating that it was part of sex education
 ladkiyaan bhi jane kaise ise shiksha samajhati raheen,raaj tab khulaa,jab yahaan kii ladki garbhvatee ho gai
 There have been many such cases, which have been considered only stale news over time
 kabhi jhaliyamari he,kabhi mujaffarpur he,or uske baad ab uttar pradesh kaa devaria,jahaan mujaffarpur jaisaa hi maamla saamne aayaa he
 The abscess is large, whose pus escapes here and there
 nahin ho paata he,to iskaa ilaaj
 No one is serious, because those who are suffering are children

 ye bacchon ke khilaaf kiye gaye yon aparaadh hai
 See, there is a big difference between being charged and proven
 hamaare yahaan mana jaataa he ki bachche bhagwaan kaa rup hai,or ve jhooth nahin bolte hai
 So whether children are lying in serious crimes like rape or the atrocities that are being perpetrated on them, they are not being proved at all

 sawaalon ke jawaab main sarkaar kanoonon ko badal detii he,sudhaar karti he,adhiktam sazaaon ke praavdhaan kar die jate hai,lekin adhiktam sazaaon ke baad bhi aparaadhiyon ke iraade kyon nahin badalte hai
 In Madhya Pradesh, provision was made for the death penalty in cases of crimes with girls up to 12 years of age, but even after this, the most gruesome cases of the country like Mandsaur case occurred in Madhya Pradesh
 sochna chahie ki hamaare samaaj main kya bachche surakshit hai,kya unki raksha karne vaali deevaaren hi unhen nonchne par utaaru ho gai hai
 If yes, then understand that the future of the country in which children are not safe is also not safe

 a few years ago a bizarre case came to light at the Jhaliamari Adivasi Ashram Shala in Chhattisgarh
 is adivasee-bahul ilaake main hostel ke wardan ne yah bataate hue baari-baari se kai bacchiyon kaa yon shoshan kiya ki yah sex ajukeshan kaa hissaa he
 The girls also knew how to understand this education, the secret was revealed when the girl here became pregnant
 aise kai maamle saamne aate rahe hai,jinhen samay ke saath keval basi hoti khabaren hi mana gaya
 Sometimes there is Jhaliamari, sometimes Muzaffarpur, and then now Deoria of Uttar Pradesh, where a similar case has been reported in Muzaffarpur
 phoda bada he,jiskaa mawaad ris-riskar yahaan-vahaan nikalataa he
 If it is not able to cure it
 koi gambhir he bhi to nahin,kyonki jo bhoga rahe hai,ve bachche hai
 According to the National Crime Records Bureau, in 2012, 2013 and 2014, 8,541, 12,363 and 13,766 cases of rape of children (under the age of 18) were registered within the country, but how many were punished
 aankade bataate hai ki2012main keval1,447, 2013main keval2,062or2014main2,015aropiyon ko hi doshasiddh kiya ja sakaa
 These are sexual offenses committed against children
 dekhie,aarope lagaae jane or aarope siddh hone main kitna bada antar he
 We are believed here that children are the form of God, and they do not lie
 to kya balaatkaar jaise sangeen aparaadhon main bachche jhooth bol rahe hai yaa un par jo atyaachaar kiye ja rahe hai,unhen siddh hi nahin kiya ja paa rahaa he
 
 
 The If the charge is not being proved, then how are they being punished for their misdeeds
 
 
 ?tippaniyan Apart from punishment, no option has yet been made to reduce crime, and if alternatives have been discovered, then they have not been effective
 aparaadhon kii vibhatsata hamen andar tak hilaati he or turat-phurat faansee par lataka dene ke alaava na samaaj ko koi rasta dikhataa he,na sarkaar ko
 In response to the questions, the government changes the laws, makes amends, makes provisions for maximum sentences, but why do the intentions of criminals do not change even after maximum sentences

 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has left for Japan on a four-day visit
 apane japan daure ke dauraan nitish bihar main vikaas ke liye nivesh ke maukey talaashenge
 RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has attacked Nitish on this foreign trip and said that the state will not develop till the Chief Minister does not free Bihar from RCP tax

 Tejashwi said that as long as the RCP tax remains in force in Bihar, there can be no development or investment in the state
 tejasvi ne maang kii ki nitish ko pehle pradesh ko aaaraseepi tex se mukt karana chahie
 On Nitish's visit to Japan, Tejashwi also said that he must present figures of 40 scams, corruption, loot, kidnapping, rape, murder and atrocities on Dalits in Bihar under his leadership in Japan
 tejasvi ne kaha ki japan main nitish ko yah sab aankade pesh karnaa isliye jaruri he, kyonki pichley 5 maheene main unhone bihar sarkaar ke website par yah sabhi aankade apadet nahin kii he
 Taking a dig at Nitish, Tejashwi said that if the people of Japan come to know all these things about Nitish later, then it would be an embarrassment

 bijepi ne sarkaar se apane piem pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ke liye pukhta suraksha kii maang kii he
 BJP spokesman Prakash Javadekar said that Narendra Modi should be given full security
 vah aatankiyon ke nishane par hai, yah baat sarkaar jaanati he, tab bhi kuch nahin kiya gaya
 On this, Minister of State for Home RPN Singh targeted the BJP, giving the example of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who was murdered in 1991
 singh ne kaha ki main endie ko bataanaa chahta hum ki jab ve satta main the tab purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi kii suraksha ke liye ek sab inspector bhi nahin diya gaya tha
 Perhaps that's why he lost his life
 darasal, 1991 main da neshnal front kii sarkaar satta main thi, jise baahar se bijepi kaa samarthan mil rahaa tha
 Significantly, after the blast in Patna, BJP has demanded a strong security for its Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi

 party kii ore se jari ek bayaan main kaha gaya ki yah raily main maujuud bhaajapa netaaon ko samaapt karne kii koshish thi
 It was an attempt to inflict serious injury on those present at the rally
 agar netaaon or shrotaaon ne asaadhaaran sanyam se kaam nahin liya hota, to vahaan bhagdad much sakati tha Durga Puja is not just a festival but it is a festival which is more related to people's hearts than their faith

 bengal or dilli kii durga puja main ab bahut zyada fark nahin rah gaya he sivaay pratimaaon ke
 There are many disparities between the Durga idols of Delhi and the Durga idols of Bengal
 ye hai dilli or bengal kii durga murtiyon main asamanthaayen-dilli main navaratri ke pehle din se durga mandiron main pehle din se maa ke nau swaroopon kii puja shuru ho jaati he jabaki bengali manyataon ke anusaar maa durga kii pratimaa puja pandalon main navaratri ke paanchave din sthapit kii jaati he or usee din se unki vidhivat puja archana kii shuruyaat hoti he

 haalanki bisisiai ke sachiv anuraag thakur ne kaha ki pakistan kii cricket team agar bharat aati he to sarkaar se is bare main baat kii ja sakati he
 If the consent of the Government of India is met, then there may be a series between the two countries in December
 isse pehle pisibi adhyaksh shehryaar khan ne aaj lahore main patrakaron se kaha ki bhartiya cricket board ke adhyaksh shashaank manohar ne unhen telephone karke unke saamne aupchaarik prastaav rakhaa
 Shaharyar claimed, 'shashank Manohar called me on Friday evening and told that he has got the green signal from the government to play against Pakistan
 lekin unhone kaha ki ve yuai main nahin balki bharat main shrinkhalaa khelnaa chaahate hai
 The BCCI denied the BCCI president, however, said that he has not even approached the government to seek approval and that no statement in this regard is true
 unhone kaha, ‘yah galat bayaan he
 We have not yet contacted the government
 haa maine unase phone par baat kii or ham agle do din main phir se baat kar sakate hai
 Shaharyar claimed that the BCCI has also promised to provide full proof security to the Pakistani team during the proposed series
 unhone kaha, ‘manohar ne iske saath hi kaha ki bhartiya board hamaari team ko sarvshereshth suraksha muhaiyaa karaayega tathaa mohali or kolkata jaise sthanon par maichon kaa aayojan karegaa jahaan bharat-paak maichon ke aayojan main koi dikkat nahin hoti he
 The PCB chief said that he, however, told Manohar that Pakistan would like to play the series in the UAE only in December as per the agreement signed by the BCCI with him
 unhone kaha, ‘hamen apni gharelu shrinkhalaa bharat main kyon khelni chahie jabaki samjhauta patr main yuai main khilne kii baat hui he
 Apart from this, there is also the question of the safety of our team and about five million dollars
 hamane is shrinkhalaa kii mejabani se itani kamai kii ummid lagaayi he
 'shaharyar said,' i told Manohar that how can we play in India, while there is a lot of anti-pakistan sentiment by some of his groups
 hamane apni pichhali do shrinkhlaayein bharat main kheli thi or ab mujhe lagata he ki ab samay aa gaya he ki ham shrinkhalaa kii mejabani karen
 The PCB chief, however, said that he did not have the authority to take a decision on Manohar's offer and would consult it at the Board of Governors on 17 November
 unhone kaha, ‘lekin sabase mahatvapurn yah he ki koi bhi faisla karne se pehle mujhe pradhanmantri se manjuuri leni hogi
 Now i have asked the head of the Indian cricket board to send a detailed proposal in writing

 Why only Tiwari, spinner r Ashwin was not given any chance by the team management while he could also bat well in the lower order
 captain mahendra singh dhoni ke rajya jharkhand ke rahane vaale tiwari ke saath aisa pehali baar nahin ho rahaa he
 He was included in the Asia Cup squad when he went on a tour of England with India 'A' team in June this year
 tiwari ko lag rahaa tha ki unhen yuvaraj singh kii jagah team main liya gaya he or unhen antim ekadash main jagah banane kii ummid bhi thi
 Tiwari then said, 'my dream of playing for India is going to come true
 mujhe lagata he ki mujhe yuvaraj kii jagah chunaa jayega isliye dabaav rahegaa
 The dream of this 20-year-old young batsman, however, has not been fulfilled yet
 asia cap main bhi unhen antim ekadash main jagah banane kaa mauka nahin mila tha
 Now in the triangular series, he kept on waiting for the match
 sabase ahm tathy yah he ki tiwari ko austrailia main khele gayi imarging players toornament ke liye chunaa gaya tha lekin trikoniya shrinkhalaa main chune jane ke kaaran vah austrailia main khilne kaa anubhav bhi hasil nahin kar paye
 This is not the first time that players have gone on foreign tours as tourists only
 pichley saal se bharat ke videshi dauron main adhiktar main kisi na kisi khilaadi ko khilne kaa mauka nahin mila
 In January 2009, when the Indian team went to play a tri-series in Bangladesh, Ashok Dinda spent the entire time sitting in the dressing room
 isse pehle test shrinkhalaa ke liye tej gendbaaj sudeep tyaagi ko team main chunaa gaya tha
 Before going on tour, he had expressed confidence that he would be able to make it to the playing XI but that could not happen
 iske baad jab bhartiya team newjiland daure par gayi thi to lakshmipathi balaji, dhaval kulkarni, murali vijay or amit mishra test team main hone ke baavjood match nahin khel paye the
 After this, players like Irfan Pathan, Dinesh Karthik and Pragyan Ojha played tourists in the ODI series against New Zealand
 westeindies daure main murali vijay, aar pi singh or ojha jabaki sitambar 2009 main srilanka main trikoniya shrinkhalaa main praveen kumaar, amit mishra or abhishek nair ko khilne kaa mauka nahin mila tha
 Munaf Patel did not get a chance to play in the recently concluded Test series in Sri Lanka

 Munaf now reached Dambulla to cover Ishant Sharma and he was selected in the team for the first time today
 vaishvik bazaar main china or thailand kii lichi ko ab bihar kii shahi lichi takkar detii najar aegi
 For this, an action plan has been prepared to improve the quality of the state's famous royal litchi and increase production capacity
 vaishvik bazaar main badi pratiyogita ke kaaran rashtriya lichi anusandhan centre ne bihar ke utpaadakon ke liye ek varsh kii avadhi ke liye ek kaary yojana taiyaar kii he, jisamen rajya sarkaar bhi madad karegi
 In view of the productivity of litchi in the state, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research has established a National Research Institute for Litchi in Muzaffarpur in the year 2001
 rajya main aise to kai jilon main lichi kii kheti kii jaati he lekin mujffarpur lichi kii kheti kaa mukhya centre he
 Vishal Nath, director of the National Research Institute, told IANS that the farmers themselves would bear the responsibility of a good crop
 unhone bataaya ki bagbani (horticulture) mishan ke tahat achche prabandhan or uttam gunvattta ke maddenjar ek kaarykram taiyaar kiya gaya he, jiske tahat buudhvaar se prashikshakon dwaara lichi ke kisaanon ko prashikshit karne kaa kaarykram prarambh kar diya gaya
 He said that there is no decrease in the quality of royal litchi but preparations are being made to improve it, in which the technique is being used
 yah prashikshan rajya ke paanch lichi utpaadak jilon mujffarpur, samastipur, vaishali, motihaari or sitamarhi ke kisaanon ko diya ja rahaa he
 He informed that this training will be given to the farmers up to the block level
 ek anya vaigyanik ne bataaya ki yojana or kisaanon kii mehnat safal hui to ek acre main 10 lakh tak kii aamadani ho sakegi
 Soil health and pest management have also been arranged in this scheme
 yojana par kaam karne vaale kisaanon ko sarkaar aarthik sahaayta bhi degi
 This scheme will prevent 20 to 25 percent litchi damage due to various reasons
 ullekhneey he ki haal ke dinon main thailand or china ne lichi kii gunvattta main kaaphi sudhaar kiya he
 Bihar also has to focus on this to stay in the competition
 bihar kii shahi lichi kii sabase adhik maang britain sahit europea deshon main he
 Scientists believe that if the quality improves, the income of farmers will increase due to increased exports
 rajya main shahi, china, lougia, bekhnaa sahit kai prakaar kii lichi kaa utpaadan kiya jaataa he lekin yahaan shahi or china lichi kaa utpaadan sarvaadhik hota he
 Bihar accounts for 74 percent of the total litchi production in the country
 bihar main kul 30,600 acre bhoomi main lichi kii kheti kii jaati he

 Deliberate remarks: One of the women sitting in a fast outside this red Digambar Jain temple in old Delhi says that Vishal Dadlani is a great singer

 It is the way of every saint and every religion, in which form it comes before the people

 ye daawa desh ke kisi hinduvadi sanghathan kaa nahin, balki australian yuva vaigyanikon ke ek dal kaa he
 There is a competition going on in Europe these days about how the aircraft will be in the future and what type of fuel will be used in them
 isamen duniyabar ke yuva vaigyanikon ko apane idia yaa model pesh karne the
 The competition was organized by Airbus, the plane maker of Europe
 isamen aakhri main jo paanch idia shortlist kiye gaye, usamen se ek gobar se plane udaane vaala bhi tha
 The scientific team, named Team Klima, claims that methane gas produced from cow dung and other farm waste can be used as fuel on the plane
 model ke mutabik, is gas ko khub thanda karke ek khaas kism ke saanche main bhar diya jayega
 It will be fitted with the engine of the plane
 yahaan se ingine kii jarurat ke mutabik eendhan kii supplai hoti rahegi
 But right now there is a problem in this model
 darasal, plane udaane ke liye jitne eendhan kii jarurat he, uske hisaab se gobar kii kami pad jaaegi
 Those working on this alternative fuel say that 70 gallons of fuel can be produced from the amount of cow dung that a cow gives in a year
 landan se neuyork jane vaali flite kaa udhaaharan len to saadhe teen hajaar mile kii duuri tay karne vaali is flite ke liye hawaii jahaaj ko 17,500 galen eendhan chahie
 In this way, at the current rate, the amount of cow dung that 1 thousand cows will do in three months will be spent as fuel in this one flight
 isliye philhal scientist is tarah ke prayog kar rahe hai, jisamen kam se kam gobar se zyada se zyada gas yani eendhan prodyus kiya ja sake
 If this experiment was successful, it would be better for the environment as well
 clima team kaa akalan he ki gobar se banane vaala eendhan carbon-dioxide kaa bananaa 97 fisadi tak kam kar saktaa he
 Methane will be used as the first fuel to fly the plane, but many vehicles used in farming in the US run with similar fuel
 iskaa process bahut saral hota he
 Cow-buffalo dung and other waste generated on the farm are stored in a tank
 suraj kii raushnee padane ke baad is tanks main methane gas paidaa hoti he, jiskaa istemaal eendhan ke taur par kiya jaataa he
