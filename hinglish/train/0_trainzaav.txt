 Eminent Bollywood actor Aamir Khan supported the Jan Lokpal draft bill of Gandhian Anna Hazare to put the Prime Minister's post, the judiciary and the conduct of mps within the purview of the proposed anti-corruption body

 The Hazare side has sent a 20-question questionnaire to about 250 celebrities on important issues of the Lokpal Bill
 aamir is prashnawali kaa uttar dene vaali shuruaati hastiyon main shaamil hai
 According to a statement issued by Aamir Khan-turned-itemist Baihazare's movement 'against Corruption', Aamir said that the conduct of mps within the Prime Minister, the judiciary and the Parliament should be kept within the purview of the proposed Lokpal
 abhinayta ne khaas taur par kaha, ‘pradhanmantri pad ko lokapal ke daayre main hona chaiye
 However, Aamir's views on the selection process of the proposed Lokpal are different from the government and the Hazare side
 aamir kaa kahana he ki lokapal kii chayan prakriya main chaar nyaayadhishon or swatantra sanvaidhanik padon par asin chaar anya vyaktiyon ko shaamil kiya janaa chaiye

 Aamir supported the ideas of the Hazare side, such as the Lokpal at the Center as well as the proposed Citizen's Charter, informing the formation of Lokayukta in the states, punishing officials guilty of corruption and timely completion of work in government departments
 abhinayta ne kaha, ‘lokapal ko sarkaar ke niyantran main nahin rahanaa chaiye
 Lokpal should remain accountable to the people of the country

 Chandrashekhar Azad, the revolutionary who sacrificed for the independence of the country, was sentenced to 15 lashes when he first came under the captivity of the British
 aazaadee ko lekar unka jajba aisa tha ki wo peeth par kode khate rahe or vande maataram kaa udghosh karte rahe
 Today Prime Minister Narendra Modi also tweeted for him
 kuch aisa hi tha unka vyaktitv
 Let us know some things related to Chandrashekhar Azad here that you may not know
 14 saal kii umr se chunaa kranti kaa rastachandrashekhar aaazaad kaa janm aaj hi ke din yani 23 july 1906 ko hua tha
 He was born in Bhabra in Alirajpur district of Madhya Pradesh
 1920 main 14 varsh kii aayu main chandrashekhar aaazaad gandhi ji ke asahyog andolan se jude the
 His name became so free, at the age of 14, he was arrested and presented before the judge
 yahaan jaj ne jab unka naam poocha to puri dridhtaa se unhone kaha ki aaazaad
 Asked the father's name, he said loudly, 'freedom'
 pataa poochne par bole -jail
 At this, the judge sentenced him to publicly flog 15
 ye wo pal tha jab unki peeth par 15 kode baras rahe the or wo vande maataram kaa udghosh kar rahe the
 This was the day when the countrymen started calling him by the name of Azad
 dhire dhire unki khyaati badhane lagi thi
 Azad Chandrasekhar Azad was a shooter since childhood, since childhood was very good
 darasal isaki training unhone bachapan main hi le thi
 After the Chauri Chaura incident in 1922, Gandhiji withdrew the movement, like all the young men of the country, Azad became disillusioned with the Congress
 jiske baad pandit ram prasad bismil, shachindranath sanyaal yogeshchandra chatarji ne 1924 main uttar bharat ke krantikariyon ko lekar ek dal hindustani prajatantrik sangh kaa gathan kiya
 Chandrashekhar Azad also joined this team
 chandrashekhar aaazaad ne 1928 main lahore main british police ofer espi saunders ko goli markar lala lajpat raay kii maut kaa badla liya tha
 His life changed after Azad Ramprasad Bismil joined the revolutionary organization Hindustan Republic Association (HRA)
 unhone sarkari khajaane ko lut kar sanghathan kii krantikari gatividhiyon ke liye dhan jutanaa shuru kar diya
 He believed that this wealth belongs to the Indians, which was looted by the British
 ramprasad bismil ke netritv main aaazaad ne kakori cond (1925) main sakriy bhaag liya tha
 Chandrashekhar Azad used to say that Azad would be free, "we will face the bullets of the enemy, we have been free, we will remain free" There was a time for his slogan that every youth used to repeat everyday
 wo jis shaan se manch se bolte the, hajaaron yuva unke saath jaan lutaaney ko taiyaar ho jaataa tha
 
 
 
 or aakhir menbehandr Shekhar Azad elahabaad ke alfred park main sukhdev or apane ek anya or mitra ke saath yojana bana rahe the
 Suddenly the British police attacked him
 aaazaad ne police par goliyaan chalaayin taaki unke saathi sukhdev bachakar nikal saken
 Azad was badly injured by police bullets
 ve saikadon police waalon ke saamne 20 minute tak loha lete rahe
 In the end, they have their slogan Azad, they will remain free, that is, they will never be caught and neither will the British government be able to hang them
 is tarah unhone pistaul kii aakhri goli khud ko maar lee or mathrubhumi ke liye praanon kii aahuti de di

 Leaders involved in ticket manipulation are camping in Delhi
 jhaansi or lalitpur jile ke takreeban sabhi vidhayak bhi dilli pahunchakar apni - apni daavedaari sunishchit karne main vyast hai
 After Uma Bharti's refusal, finding a candidate for Jhansi seat will be so difficult that hardly anyone could have guessed it
 sanghathan ko donon hi siton par pratyaashee chayan main pasinaa aa gaya he
 a day before in Jhansi, State President Mahendra Nath Pandey said that the name of the candidate of Jhansi Lok Sabha will be announced on Monday
 ab jab somvaar kaa din bhi dhal gaya or kal se namakan prakriya bhi shuru hone ja rahi he to sabhi kii najar pratyaashiyon ke chehre par he ki pratyaashee koun hoga
 It is believed that the name of Vaidyanath Ayurved chairman Anurag Sharma came in the headlines as a candidate from BJP and RSS
 bataaya gaya ki anuraag kaa naam aate hi jhaansi sadar vidhayak ravi sharma, babina vidhayak rajeev singh, lalitpur vidhayak ramratan kushvaha ne is par maukhik etraj jataayaa tha
 Along with this, opposition to the name of Ganga Charan Rajput as Lodh candidate also started as an external candidate
 is virodh ke bich pratyaashee kaa faisla latak gaya
 Four seats of Bundelkhand were still candidates for Brahmins from Banda, Thakur from Hamirpur, Lodh Backward from Jhansi and Scheduled Caste from Jalaun
 is baar bhi bhaajapa ne hamirpur se pushpendra singh chandel or jalon se bhanu pratap verma kaa tikat barkaraar rakhaa he
 Now if a Brahmin gets a ticket from Banda, BJP can give ticket to Lodh or Backward Classes in Jhansi
 banda se bhairo prasad mishra ko dobaaraa tikat milanaa mushkil lag rahaa he
 Here the name of Malini Awasthi is also mentioned, and R
 in the backward class
 ke
 Discussions are also being given to give tickets to Patel
 jabaki jhaansi seat kaa faisla uma bharti se raishumaari ke baad bhi nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 Among Brahmin candidates from Jhansi, MLA Ravi Sharma and Vaidyanath chairman Anurag Sharma, Lodh candidates Ganga Charan Rajput and MLA Jawahar Rajput, Kushwaha candidate MLA Ramratan Kushwaha have been prominently in the discussion
 mana ja rahaa he ki anuraag sharma ke naam kaa elaan lagbhag hone hi vaala tha tabhi vidhayakon kii aapatti ke baad uma bharti ne ise rukvaa diya
 Later, Ganga Charan, a candidate of the likes of Uma Bharti, also protested in the name of outsider
 isi raajnneeti main sanghathan ne jhaansi or banda seat ke pratyaashiyon kii ghoshnaa roak di he
 Because the Lodh Samaj is in a decisive position on the Jhansi seat, the organization does not want to announce the candidate without taking Uma Bharti in confidence
 philhal uma bharti kisi bhi tikat ke daavedaar se sidhe nahin mil raheen hai
 In such a situation it is also difficult to say on whose head Uma will be
 yaa phir sanghathan apane aantarik survey ke aadhaar par pratyaashee kii ghoshnaa kar degaa

 Last year, this conference took place in Dhordo (bhuj) and the Prime Minister himself got up at six in the morning for two days and did yoga himself
 saath hi puure desh ke sabhi afasaron ko dandavat namaskara karwaae the
 But this time the Prime Minister himself is not sure whether he will participate in the Yoga session or not, so all the officers are focusing more on the practice of easy dead bodies and easy hair
 tippaniyan "I do a dead body very well," said a senior officer smiling to NDTV, so according to a police officer, the focus should be on breathing activities in such a yoga session
 akhir police afasar tanavbhari zindagi jo jite he
 There should be focus on yoga asanas like anulom-antonyms like Kapalabhati
 "mujhe khud anulom-vilom karnaa pasand he kyunki usase puraa sharir tandoorast rahata he," unka tark he
 By the way, the Prime Minister's Office says that the Prime Minister is taking part in this meeting on this day only because he is paying more attention to the demonetisation in the country
 iske peeche sidhaa-sidhaa tark ye he ki pradhanmantri is saal is baithak main sirf ek din hissaa lenge yani november 25 shaam hyderabad pahunchenge or duusari dopaher yani 26 november ko vahaan se ravaanaa ho jaaenge

 saath hi puure desh ke sabhi afasaron ko dandavat namaskara karwaae the
 But this time the Prime Minister himself is not sure whether he will participate in the Yoga session or not, so all the officers are focusing more on the practice of easy dead bodies and easy hair
 tippaniyan "I do a dead body very well," said a senior officer smiling to NDTV, so according to a police officer, the focus should be on breathing activities in such a yoga session
 akhir police afasar tanavbhari zindagi jo jite he
 There should be focus on yoga asanas like anulom-antonyms like Kapalabhati
 "mujhe khud anulom-vilom karnaa pasand he kyunki usase puraa sharir tandoorast rahata he," unka tark he
 By the way, the Prime Minister's Office says that the Prime Minister is taking part in this meeting on this day only because he is paying more attention to the demonetisation in the country
 pichley saal ye conference dhordo (bhuj) main hui thi or pradhanmantri ne do din khud subah chah baje uthakar khud to yoga kiya tha
 At the same time, all the officers of the whole country had got him worshiped
 lekin is baar khud pradhanmantri kaa pakkaa nahin he ki wo yoga seshan main hissaa lenge yaa nahin isiilie sabhi afasar is saal zyaada fokas shav aasaan or bal aasaan kii practice par kar rahe hai
 The comments "main shav aasaan bahut acha karata hoon," ek varisht adhikari ne enditivi se muskuraate hue kaha to ek police afasar ke mutabiq aise yoga satr main sirf saans lene kii kriyaaon par fokas hona chahie
 After all, police officers live stressful lives
 anulom-vilom jaise he kapaalbhaati jaise yoga asana par fokas hona chahie
 "I like to do the reverse - because it keeps the whole body healthy," he argues
 vaise pradhanmantri karyaalay kaa kahana he kii pradhanmantri is saal ek din hi is baithak main isiilie hissaa le rahe hai kyonki desh main jo notebandi ko lekar hallaa much rahaa he us par wo zyaada dhyaan de rahe he

 The Supreme Court told the central government that you do not want to do anything concrete about solid waste management, while this problem is in the whole country

 Because there is a lot of funds under the cleanliness drive
 thos kachare ke niptaare ke liye is fund kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he

 ) Denying the title of Shiv Sena chief, the party's working president Uddhav Thackeray said that his late father Bal Thackeray cannot be removed from the post
 party ke mukhpatr 'saamana' ko die saakshaatkaar main uddhav ne kaha, doosraa koi shivasena pramukh nahin hoga
 He stated clearly that he will not replace the 'shiv Sena chief', as this place will always be that of his late father Bal Thackeray
 unhone kaha ki bal thakare hameshaa hi 'shivasena pramukh' or 'hindoohruday samraat' rahenge
 These titles are only right for his personality

 In an interview to the party mouthpiece 'saamana', Uddhav said, there will be no other Shiv Sena chief
 unhone saaf shabdon main kaha ki vah 'shivasena pramukh' kii jagah nahin lenge, kyonki yah jagah hameshaa hi unke divangat pita bal thakare kii rahegi
 He said that Bal Thackeray will always be 'shiv Sena chief' and 'hindu heart emperor'
 ye oopaadhiyaan sirf unke hi vyaktitv ke liye sahi hai
 Bal Thackeray died on 17 November
 uddhav ne haalanki aupchaarik rup se shivasena pramukh kaa pad sweekaar karne se manaa kar diya, lekin party ne nirnay karne ke sabhi adhikaar unhen saunp die hai
 Until now, these rights were with Bal Thackeray
 tippaniyan Party spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut said, Shiv Sena leaders had an important meeting on Saturday, in which it was decided that the powers that Bala Saheb had were given to Uddhav
 unhone kaha ki bala sahib kaa sapana puraa karne ke liye uddhav ke netritv main party ekajute rahegi
 The meeting took place on the second floor of 'matoshree', a residence in the Bandra suburb of the Thackeray family, where Bal Thackeray resided
 raut ne kaha, baithak ke dauraan bahut hi bhaavnaatmak maahaul tha
 Raut, former Lok Sabha Speaker Manohar Joshi, Sudhir Joshi, Liladhar Dacke, Subhash Desai, Ramdas Kadam and Gajanan Keertikar were also present at the meeting

 Let us tell you that Switzerland's star tennis player Roger Federer has won the Swiss Indors Basel tournament title for the eighth time, becoming the second best tennis player of the Open Era
 vah check ganraajya ke khilaadi evan landal se ek khitaab peeche hai, vahiin america ke diggaj jimmy conorse se 14 khitaab peeche hai
 Also Roger Federer has withdrawn his name from the Rolex Paris Masters tournament starting next week
 toornament ke aayojakon kii ore se hui ghoshnaa ke anusaar, peeth kii chot ke kaaran federer ne yah faisla liya
 According to IANS, Paris Masters organizers said in a tweet, "federer has withdrawn from the tournament due to a back injury
 ’ Politics has always been the art of possibilities; Some mps in Bihar have broadened the meaning of this proverb in an unexpected way
 baat jab loksabhaa sadsyta or visheshadhikaar tathaa bhatton kii aati he to ve party main hote hai, baaki saare maukon par uske khilaaf najar aate hai
 Recently, Janata Dal United (JD-U) national president Sharad Yadav asked all such mps to "resign from the party before campaigning for another party"
 par is rujhaan ke peedit rajd pramukh lalu prasad ne baat bekaar jane kii sambhaavna ke maddenjar is babat kuch zyada na kahana behatar samajha
 In fact, JD-U MP Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh is openly campaigning for the Congress before the Bihar Assembly elections
 spasht rup se vahi is rujhaan ke agrani hai
 He was elected to the Lok Sabha in 2009 on a JD-U ticket from Munger
 jad-you ke purv pradesh adhyaksh lalan singh ne is saal farvari main apane pad se tyaagptr de diya lekin party nahin chodi
 Since then, this 55-year-old MP has not hesitated to play the role of Leader of the Opposition
 unhone party kii sadsyta chhodkar yaa kisi duusari party main shaamil na hokar jad-you saansad bane rahane main hi bhalaai samajhi
 He also did not violate the party whip during the voting
 agar unhone aisa kiya hota to dasvin anusuchee ke mutabik unhen dal-badal ke aadhaar par ayogy tehraaya ja saktaa he
 Lalan Singh, a friend of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, wants to expel him from JD-U so that he becomes independent
 haalanki unhone congress kaa samarthan karke or nitish par nijee hamale bolkar party ko kaaphi sharminda kiya he, lekin jad-you unhen nishkasit karne se kataraa rahaa he
 He is due to the fact that if the party expels him, he will remain an MP as an Independent
 agar ve istipha denge to ve saansad bhi nahin rahenge
 RJD chief Lalu Prasad is also struggling with similar situations because of his MP Umashankar Singh
 maharajaganj ke 70 varshiya saansad umashankar singh apane kattar pratidwandvi prabhunath singh ko rajd main shaamil kiye jane ke baad se hi lalu kii khuleam laanat-malamat kar rahe hai
 Umashankar also resigned from the RJD Parliamentary Board without relinquishing membership of the party
 ve bhi rajd pratyaashiyon ke khilaaf prachaar kar rahe hai
 Apart from these, two more Lok Sabha mps from Bihar are fighting against their party leadership
 in saansadon ne party chode bagaiyr uske khilaaf hokar dal-badal virdohi kanoon kii simaaon ko ujagar kar diya he
 This law came into force in 1985 as the 52nd Amendment
 is kanoon kii khaamiyon ko dur karne kii jarurat pehle se mahasoos kii ja rahi thi lekin in khaamiyon kii vajah se bihar ke saansadon ko thali kaa maal udaakar usamen chhed karne kaa mauka mil gaya he
 For example, the law does not provide for the identification of some members as "independents", but does not disqualify members expelled from the party
 pandrahavin loksabhaa main trinmul congress ke saansad kabir suman ne party kii sadsyta chode bagaiyr netritv ko kosna shuru kar diya
 But given the number of rebel mps just before the assembly elections, Bihar may be the subject of a case study of how public representatives can betray their party
 jad-you ke saansadon-jainarayan nishad (mujffarpur) or poornamasi ram (gopalganj)-ne apane parijanon ke liye congress ke tikat kii vyavastha kar lee lekin nishad kii bahu ne congress kaa tikat lautaa diya
 Nishad said, "there is no compromise with JD-U
" meri ba ne chunaav nahin ladane kaa faisla kiya he isliye vah nahin lard rahi he
 By the way, i am completely with JD-U
 '' poornamasi ram ko bhi us samay jhatka laga jab congress ne unke bete vijay ram ko apana chunaav chinh dene ke baad waapas le liya
 Ram said, "vijay has already filed his nomination as a Congress candidate
 If his nomination is canceled, i will support another candidate
" '' jaahir he, ram adhikrut jad-you pratyaashee ke khilaaf prachaar karenge
 These cases have raised both constitutional and political questions
 lalan singh or umashankar singh, jinhen loksabhaa sadsyta acchhee lagati he lekin party ke netaa nagavar guzarate hai, ke alaava baaki saansadon kaa ravaiya party ke khilaaf isliye he kyonki unke parijan chunaav ladanaa chaahate the or maidan main kud gaye hai
 The NDA, Congress or LJP-RJD alliance is also no less contributing towards this trend
 unhone rajnatik pratidwandviyon ke parijanon ko rijhaayaa or tikat thama diya
 Clearly this trend was initiated by the parties of Bihar and they will be its beneficiaries
 rajd ke do saansad-jagadanand singh or raghuvansh prasad singh, jinke parivaar ke sadasyon ko pratidwandvi partiyon ne tikat diya he-lalu prasad kaa saath de rahe hai
 BJP has fielded Sudhakar Singh, son of Jagadanand Singh, while Congress has fielded Raghuvanshi Prasad Singh's cousin Raghupati Singh from Mahanar seat
 donon saansadon ke chunaav purv ravaie main fark he
 While Jagadanand Singh is working in favor of his party, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh has criticized Lalu Prasad for breaking ties with the Congress
 unhone lojpa ko 75 siten dene ke faisle par prashnchinh lagaate hue congress kaa saath chhodane ko ''sabase badi galati'' qaraar diya he
 Coincidentally, the RJD had left the Mehanar seat for the LJP
 haryana ke rohtak jile main ek aadmi apane puraane dost se kahata he, jo ki ek jat ko driver kii naukari par rakh rahaa he, ''bhaisahab, aapako koi zyada bharose vaala banda lenaa chahie
 "he feels that there is danger in it
" uski aawaaj main udaasi he
 But Jagmohan Mittal, who is called the Auto King of Haryana, says in response that he does not have any other option
 jat bahul aabaadi vaale haryana ke dakshini jilon main mittal ke maaruti-sujuki ke kai showrooms hai
 Mittal's new Nexa showroom near the Delhi bypass in Rohtak was open just two days after its inauguration on February 18, when it fell prey to the Jat agitators
 (shahar se kuch dur showrooms ke godaam main 200 kaaren or esayuvi delivery ke liye taiyaar khadi thim, lekin sab jalakar khaak ho gayi
 ) The sorrow and uneasiness can still be read in Mittal's eyes
 ve kehete hai, ''maine takreeban 5,000 logon ko naukari par rakhaa he, lekin iske pehle kabhi kisi kii jati ke bare main nahin sochaa
 "there has been a ruckus about the demand for Jat reservation and now the most important question for Mittal is what is the caste of the man whom he is hiring
" ve maano aashcharya se bhare hue kehete hai, ''takreeban 70 fisadi log jat hai
 "though he has no intention of retrenching the Jats, the violence has taken a form of havoc and as Manohar Lal Khattar's government has failed to stop him, Mittal may think in this direction
" aaj puure haryana main jaisi dooriyaan or avishvaas kaa maahaul he, vaisaa pehle kabhi nahin dekha gaya
 For three days and three nights in February this year, the rage of continuous violence, loot and arson and the manner in which the police-administration was paralyzed in front of it has changed the appearance of the state
 jaateey pahchaan or asmitaayen khatarnaak tareeke se taqatvar ho uthi hai
 On one side there are Jats and on the other side there are 35 fraternities of Haryana, which together form the fabric of this society
 yahaan kii sadakon kaa mizaaj badal gaya he
 Conversations in heavy voice have turned into slow whispers
 log ek-duusare ko shaq kii najar se dekhte hai
 The owners of non-jat shops in the markets (punjabi, Saini, Brahmin, Baniya) are silent and scared
 74 saal ke gulshan raay tandon bijli vibhaag ke ritred karmchaaree hai or sonipat ke gohana main rahete hai
 The recent violent incidents evoke violent memories of the partition of India seen in her childhood
 ve yaad karte hai ki kis tarah unke parivaar ko pakistan main apane pushtaini ghar ko chhodkar bhaagane ke liye majaboor hona padaa tha
 He says, "it seemed that the time of 1947 had returned
" vahi dehshat, asuraksha, aag ke hawaale kar die gaye ghar, dukaane
 "in February this year, he told his son," The time has come to leave home again
 ''haryana ke aath jilon rohtak, sonipat, jhajjar, kaithal, jind, bhivani, hisar or panipat ke chote kasbe or shahar hinsa se sabase zyada prabhavit hue
 Of these, Gohana probably saw the most formidable form of violence
 aasapaas ke gaanvon se updravi jaaton kii belgaum bheed haathon main hathiyaar, pistaul, kudaalen liye or botalon main petrol bhar chun-chunakar gaiyr-jat dukaanon or gharon ko apana nishaanaa bana rahi thi
 Shops were being looted before the fire was handed over
 or yah sab kuch police, sena or jile ke adhikariyon kii naak ke neeche ho rahaa tha
 On the corner of Gohana's Civil Road was Mohit Tandon's bookstore, which survived as if by some divine charisma
 tandon kehete hai, ''yaad karke ruh kaanp jaati he
 "but 42-year-old Mohit is paying a much higher price than those whose livelihood was given to the fire
 ve apni pahchaan kaa iklauta ghar or gohana chhodie ke liye majaboor hai
 He says, "even if i decide to live here, my children will not get rid of that fear and panic
" '' ve us din ko yaad karte hai, jab hinsa or lutpaat ke baad unka aath saal kaa betaa pehle din skool gaya
 He says, "you can imagine children in school talking about the shops that were lit
" 
 
 bacchon ke bich main jat banaam anya kii lakeer khinch gai thi
 So Mohit has decided to flee from there
 philhal unka parivaar kiraye kaa ek makaan lekar karnal main rahegaa
 They hope that Karnal will be relatively safer
 mohit kuch arsa gohana main hi rahenge kyonki ''ek jagah se ukhadkar nai jagah bijness shuru karnaa itnaa aasaan nahin he
 "the Tandon family is not the only one, who is seeking a more secure corner for himself outside this Jat land
" 49 varshiya mukesh kumaar ne apni kitabon kii dukaan main acadmic kitabon kaa nayaa stock bharaa tha, jo ve har nae satr ke pehle karte the
 "they (rioters) filled their trolleys with everything they could sell or use," he says with tears in their eyes, setting the rest of the shop on fire
 '' haal hi main unhone dukaan kii bagal main ek choti-si computer shop bhi kholi thi
 She also got burnt
 ve kehete hai, ''dukaan hi parivaar kii roji-roti kaa ekmaatr jariya thi
 Currently, Mukesh has Rs 30 lakh from the bank to refill the new goods in his shop
 ke karj ke alaava khatter sarkaar se mili muaavje kii kuch rakam he, jo sarkaar ne ek karod ru
 Have given to shoppers with a loss of less than Rs
 mukesh bataate hai ki sthaneey jaaton ko is baat se bhi naaraazgi he ki sarkaar ne hamaare nuksaan kii aanshik bharpai karne kii koshish kii he
 They insist, "now what does it mean to stay here?" 45-year-old Jaipal Sharma, a former Air Force officer, lives on Civil Road
 haalanki ve aarthik rup se zyada behatar sthiti main hai, lekin unka avsaad kam nahin he
 "it was not a movement for reservation," he insists
 haalanki hamalavar jat the, lekin ve sab darasal lutere the
 He came and did it with absolute confidence in the way he came to live
 police or sena ne ungali tak nahin hilaai
 Sharma points to two important facts: The first is that the mob selectively targeted the shops of Brahmins, Banias and Punjabis, while the truth is that none of these communities demand Jats to take reservations as a backward community
 Was never against

 RISAT-1 was declared dead in 2017 so it could not record the impact of the Balakot strike
 beete saal 9 july ko pakistan ne bhi PAKTES 1A satellite launch kiya tha
 ISRO sources said, 'RISAT-2B was released 15 months ago and its life is only 5 years
 agar sab kuch thik rahaa to iske 2 clon RISAT-BR1 or RISAT-2BR2 aane vaale maheenon main launch kiye jaaenge
 'next launch by ISRO will be Chandrayaan-2
 antariksh agency ne is maheene ke prarambh main kaha tha ki 9 se 16 july, 2019 ke dauraan chandrayan - 2 ko bheje jane ke liye saare modul taiyaar kiye ja rahe hai
 Chandrayaan-2 is likely to land on the moon on September 6

 The National Investigation Agency (NIA) conducted raids in several cities of Bihar on Thursday
 is dauraan patna main santosh pandeya ke ghar se ek hathiyaar baraamad hua he
 Which is being described as AK-47
 santosh pandeya, purv vidhayak sunil pandeya or purv emelsi hulas pandeya kaa bhai he
 However, the NIA has not yet confirmed the recovered weapon AK-47
 abhi bhi bihar main NIA kii team kaa search oparation jari he
 This is not the first incident of AK-47 being recovered in Bihar, but Bihar's Munger district has become a major center of illegal weapons
 jab 20 eke47 milane se machaa tha hadakampaisase pehle pichley saal oktober main bihar ke munger jile main aise hi ek search oparation ke dauraan 20 eke 47 rifl baraamad kii gai thim
 The police also searched drains found in the Ganges river during the search operation
 darasal, soobe main ye sari kavayad kai vaardaaton main eke47 kaa istemaal kiye jane ke baad shuru kii gai thi
 a total of 18 people were arrested in this entire case till then
 bataa den ki bihar ke munger jile se bade paimaane par eke47 ke spair parts jabt kiye gaye the
 Which were recovered by the police from rivers and wells
 rajya main 3 saal pehle hathiyaar taskari racket kaa pardaafash hone ke baad ek pakhwaade tak search oparation chalaaya gaya tha
 Under the same police had found 20 AK 47s and 500 parts of it
 munger main bada search oparationpulice ne munger jile ke kai hisson main search oparation chalaaya tha
 Because Munger district is notorious for illegal manufacture of high quality advanced weapons and ammunition for the past several decades
 vahaan ganga ke kinare se hi eke47 ke 281 spair parts baraamad kiye gaye the
 As part of Operation AK 47, when police raided a house in Manzar Wardha village of Muffsil police station, the police recovered 91 spare parts of AK 47 rifle from there
 is par bhi hairaani kii baat ye he ki police kii dabish se pehle hi ghar ke sadsy vahaan se faraar ho gaye the
 AK 47 was buried in the ground somewhere in the well, according to the police of Munger, a woman named Aamna Khatoon was arrested earlier that fortnight
 usne poochtacha main khulaasa kiya tha ki eke47 ke spair parts gaanv ke ek kuen main chhipaae gaye hai
 After this, the police raided there and recovered spare parts
 ullekhneey he ki police ne jab aamanaa ke ghar par dabish di thi
 So there were two AK 47s buried in the floor of the house
 jo istemaal kiye jane ke liye taiyaar thim
 Police said the recovery of spare parts clearly indicated that arms smugglers make AK 47s as per demand
 jabalpur aayudh depo se jude the tarahathiyaaron ke is racket kaa khulaasa hone ke baad jaanch main paaya gaya ki baraamad kii gai kuch eke47 rifl madhya pradesh ke jabalpur main kendriya aayudh depo main taiyaar kii gai thim
 From there they were smuggled to Bihar to transport them to Maoists and terrorists
 is khulaase ne adhikariyon kii neend uda di
 Since 2012, it is believed that more than 60 AK 47 rifles have gone missing from Jabalpur OD depot
 jinhen taskari kar munger bheja gaya
 In this connection, Purushottam Lal, who was posted as an armor in the depot, was arrested
 jis par in hathiyaaron ko taskaron tak pahunchane kaa iljaam he
 Police arrested four people from Madhya Pradesh including Purushottam Lal in this case
 kai vaardaaton main eke47 kaa istemaalabatate chalem ki bihar ke mujffarpur main bekhauf aparaadhiyon ne purv meyar samir kumaar ko saream eke47 se bhun daalaa tha
 Along with Sameer Kumar, his car driver was also killed
 isse pehle haryana ke gurugram main police ne bihar ke motihaari jile ke rampur gaanv nivasee 25 varshiya ram singh urf vijay singh ko sector 15 main vaahanon kii niyamit jaanch ke dauraan pakadaa tha
 He attacked the Bihar Police team in Motihari with an AK 47 rifle in September last year
 yahi nahin usne purvi champaran main eke47 se apane virdohi bablu kumaar kii hatya bhi kii thi
 Nowadays, if you want to know about something, then people take refuge in Wikipedia
 or agar aap vikipedia par hasdev nadi khojenge to aapako iskaa parichay do panktiyon main milegaa ki hasdev nadi mahanadi kii pramukh sahaayak nadi he
 It flows into the coalfield of Korba and into the Champa plain
 hasdev nadi korea jile kii camoor kii pahadiyon se nikalakar korba, bilaspur jilon main bahati hui mahanadi main mil jaati he
 Its total length is 176 kilometers
 bas
 If you scroll down a bit, then perhaps you will see another line which states that according to a survey, the Hasdev river is the most polluted river in Chhattisgarh
 vikipedia main yogadan karne vaale ne yah nahin bataaya he ki yah survey koun sa tha or chhattisgarh kii yah nadi sabase pradooshit he to par yah samasya kitni gahari he
 We have probably accepted polluted rivers and ponds as our destiny
 hasdev chhattisgarh kii 21 un nadiyon main shaamil he jise soobe kii jeevanarekha kaha ja saktaa he
 For the first 125 km in its journey, the Hasdev river remains very clean, but after reaching Korba, the river water gets polluted
 iskaa kaaran baandh se niklaa rakhdyukt pani or hanikaarak rasayan hai
 There is a Bango dam on the Hasdev river itself, as well as 11 anicuts have been built so far from where water is supplied to industrial institutions
 banane ke samay is baandh kii jal bharaav kshamta 3,046 million ghan meter (emsm) thi, lekin gaad bharne kii vajah se yah ab ghatakar 2,894 emsm rah gai he
 The construction of the Hasdev Bango Dam was completed in 1992
 pichley 27 saal main baandh kii jal bharaav kshamta 10 fisad ghat gai he
 In the dam, silt flows in the water during the rains
 is baat kii pushti kendriya jal ayog kii report bhi karti he
 For this reason, 23 million cubic meters have been reduced from the prescribed quantity to provide water to industrial institutions
 yahaan se udyogon ko dene ke liye 418 emsm pani rigerv rakhaa gaya he
 First 441 MCM water reserve was kept for industries
 kharif sinchai ke liye 1,454 emsm pani rigerv rakhaa gaya he
 The water from ntpc's Rakhdar (flyash) dam between the Bango dam to the pass barrage comes into the river
 iske baad darri baraj se neeche belgari or dhengurnala kaa pani nadi main jaataa he
 Ashoki water flows from here also
 madhya pradesh se alag hone ke baad se is ilaake main audyogikaran tej hua he or krishi kii aadhunik vidhiyaan apnaane se hasdev nadi main kai tarah ke baari dhaatuon kaa jamaav hone laga he
 Rajshri Singh has prepared a research paper on this and his paper explains in detail about the amount of heavy metals deposited in the Hasdev River
 shodh ke mutabik, in baari dhaatuon ke sampark main aane se na sirf nadi ke jaleey jeevon par bura asar padegaa balki logon kii sehat par iskaa asar dikhne bhi laga he
 According to the paper, pollutants were investigated at ten different locations in Korba
 nadi ke pani main cadmium, copper, lead, louh, or zinc jaise dhaatuon kii maatra maanakon ke lihaaj se kaaphi adhik maani gai he
 Actually, Korba may be called the energy capital of the state, but the power stations here have stopped the breath of the Hasdev river
 yahaan ke taap bijli gharon main rojaanaa 80 hajaar ton koyale kii khapat hoti he or uskaa 40 fisad hissaa raakh ke rup main batch jaataa he
 This bottom ash and fly ash are soaked in water and taken to ashram dam
 antipisi, bijli utpaadan company, baalko kaa rakhad dame hasdev nadi ke saath naalon ke kinare he, jisaki vajah se rakhad bahakar nadi main jaataa he
 This is why water gets polluted
 is samasya kii gambhirtha kaa andaja aap isi baat se laga sakate hai ki korba ke 8 taap bijligharon se 1 lakh metric ton se adik flani aish kaa utpaadan hota he
 However, some thermal power stations do not even have ashram dams
 2009 main kendriya pradooshan niyantran board ne ek adhyayan karavaaya tha jiske mutabik, korba desh ke 88 audyogic clusters main gambhir rup se pradooshit cluster main paanchave paaydaan par tha
 Hasdev's river is suffocating with ash water
 korba main ban rahi bijli se hamaare ghar roshan ho rahe hai par ek nadi ke khatm ho jane ke baad us ilaake main kitna andhera failega, hamen iskaa jaraa bhi andaja nahin
 (manjeet Thakur is the special correspondent of India Today) *** board of secondary ajukeshan (bisai), odisha ne varsh 2017 main hone vaali 10veen kaksha kii pariksha ke timeteble kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 The board has said that the examination of students studying in regular mode will start from February 28 and will run till March 10
 tippaniyan Application forms for the exam will be filled from November 1

 All the necessary information related to how the application form will be filled will be released online
 gauratlab he ki farvari main hi panchayat chunaav hone ke chalate pariksha kii tithi ko lekar asamanjas kii sthiti paidaa ho gai thi
 The State Election Commission asked the board not to conduct any examination in February
 ab board ne rajya sarkaar ke saath vichaar-vimarsh kar pariksha kaa final timeteble ghoshit kar diya he
 Application forms for the exam will be filled from November 1
 bisai adhyaksh sukant kumaar das ke mutabik is baar pariksha main chah lakh se zyada chaatro ke baithne kii ummid he
 All the necessary information related to how the application form will be filled will be released online
 gauratlab he ki farvari main hi panchayat chunaav hone ke chalate pariksha kii tithi ko lekar asamanjas kii sthiti paidaa ho gai thi
 The State Election Commission asked the board not to conduct any examination in February
 ab board ne rajya sarkaar ke saath vichaar-vimarsh kar pariksha kaa final timeteble ghoshit kar diya he
 Significantly, due to the Panchayat elections in February itself, a situation of confusion was created regarding the date of examination
 rajya nirvachan ayog ne board se farvari main koi bhi pariksha yojit na karne ke liye kaha tha
 Now the board in consultation with the state government has declared the final timetable of the exam
 baat cabinet pherbadal kii ho to romaanch cricket team kii ghoshnaa se zyada hota he
 This clearly shows the new game of politics
 hamen kai hafton se pataa tha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi sansad ke monsoon satr ke turant baad cabinet main pherbadal karenge
 By Saturday it was clear to everyone who would get a place in the cabinet and who would lose their chair
 chah mantri pehle hi pradhanmantri kaa kaam aasaan karne ke liye apana istipha saunp chuke the
 Three vacancies were already in the cabinet - Manohar Parrikar, Venkayya Naidu and Anil Dave
 lihaaja, pherbadal kaa ganit bhi aasaan tha: in rictiyon se pehle modi cabinet main 75 sadsy the or ravivaar ko hue vistaar main nau nae mantriyon ke saath bhi cabanet main 75 sadsy hai
 This is the third reshuffle in the tenure of the Modi cabinet and now the new team has the responsibility of remaining days
 haalanki raajnneeti cricket nahin he
 a good cricket team can win a match by playing well together on the five days of a Test match
 lekin paanch saal tak acchhee sarkaar chalaane ke baavjood vipaksh main baithi party kii jeet ke zyada asaar hote hai
 Voter behavior cannot always be estimated
 2009 main upie sarkaar bhrashtachar or gathbandhan kii khinchataan ke daur se guzar rahi thi
 GDP grew dramatically 6 in 2008-09, despite GDP growth of over 9 per cent for three consecutive years
 7 fisadi par simat jaati he
 Despite this, the ruling Congress 28 in the 2009 election
 5 fisadi vot share ke saath 61 adhik seat jitkar 206 kaa aankada chhu leti he
 In the 2004 elections, the party got 26
 5 fisadi vot share ke saath mahaj 145 seat par jeet mili thi
 The BJP, sitting in the opposition, got 138 seats in 2004 but was reduced to just 116 seats in 2009
 kya zyada seat paane kaa matlab tha ki upie-2 zyada sthir sarkaar thi? ek shodh ke mutabik 23 may 2009 se lekar 16 may 2014 tak jab modi ko vijayi ghoshit kiya gaya, manmohan singh cabinet main 16 badlaav kiye gaye
 The coming and going of ministers was also ridiculous
 upie-2 ke kaarykaal main 7 rail mantri rahe lihaaja modi ke teen saal main teen rail mantri kaa aankada itnaa kharaab nahin he
 But, 10 railway ministers in 8 years? Also read: Never endorsed demonetisation, warned about losses: Cabinet expansion in Rajdesh is seen as a change
 kya modi vaaki alag hai? ab jabaki modi ke 'minimum government, maximum gavarnence' kaa bayaan new india or 4pi kii chamak main dhoomil ho gaya he, ravivaar ko hue cabinet pherbadal ke kuch badlaavon ko samajhnaa jaruri he
 Four ministers of state who were promoted with cabinet status - Nirmala Sitharaman, Piyush Goyal, Dharmendra Pradhan and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi - all belong to Rajya Sabha and have no political land of their own
 - yah acchhee baat he ki chaar naukarshahon ko mantri banaaya gaya lekin unhen die gaye kaarybhaar kaa koi anubhav nahin he
 - vice-president Venkaiah Naidu was one of Modi's senior most ministers
 unke jimme houseing or shahari vikaas mantralay ko ab ek rajya mantri sanbhaalenge
 Also read: Raghuram Rajan said- The Governor of the Reserve Bank is not a servant of the Government- Hardeep Singh Puri was a successful Foreign Service officer
 ab unka pareekshan tej shaharikaran or smart city kii chunautiyon par kiya jayega
 Similarly, Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises will also be seen as Minister of State instead of Cabinet Minister
 gauratlab he ki notebandi ke faisle ne is mantralay ke liye kadi chunautiyaan pesh kii hai
 - Another Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (IB) of Naidu, which was earlier temporarily under Smriti Irani, will now command unrelated ministries like both Textile and IB
 - isi tarah vitt mantralay ke do rajya mantriyon kii jagah par do anya nae mantri die gaye hai jinhen mantralay kaa koi anubhav nahin he
 The move was taken at a time when the economy is going through a critical phase and needs a professional and expert leadership
 - nitin gadakari haive, road transport or shipping mantralay ko safaltaapurvak chalaa rahe the or ab unhen iske saath namaami gange or jal-sansaadhan mantralay bhi sanbhaalanaa hoga
 Uma Bharti was earlier with this assignment and she was clearly found to have failed to fulfill the responsibilities
 iske baavjood unki chuttee nahin kii gai or unhen peyajal or swatchta mantralay kaa jimmaa diya gaya he
 On the same lines, former Mumbai Police Commissioner Satya Pal has been given the charge of Human Resource and Water Resource, making him Minister of State
 vahiin petroleum or natural gas mantralay ko bakhubi sanbhaalane vaale rajya mantri dharmendra pradhan ab bataur cabinet mantri yah kaam karenge
 Apart from this, Skill Development of the flagship scheme of the Central Government has also been done
 - vahiin puri or alphons kannanthanam ko sidhe rajyamantri kaa darja diya gaya he
 His shift in politics is as an experiment
 - ant main nirmala sitaraman ko dephence mantralay kii jimmedaari modi sarkaar main sabase ahm badlaav he
 It is a gesture of women empowerment before 2019 elections and an attempt to give a clear indication that equal opportunities are available for all in BJP
 raajnneeti main apni jagah banane main safal nirmala ko commers or industry mantralay ke kaarykaal main koi vishesh uplabdhi haath nahin lagi
 Here she was the Minister of State with independent charge
 vahiin beete teen saal tak cabinet darje ke saath rail mantralay chalaane vaale suresh prabhu ko ab nirmala kaa mantralay diya gaya he
 Prabhu made efforts to improve the railways during the three years but the frequent train accidents forced the government to make this change
 lihaaja, ek baat saaf he ki agle 20 maheenon tak modi sarkaar ke liye myne nahin rakhata ki koun vyakti kis mantralay kii kaman sambhaal rahaa he
 BJP President Amit Shah has started his Mission 350
 modi cabinet main pramotion paae mantri dharmendra pradhan(kerala), puyush goyal (tamilnadu) or nirmala sitaraman (karnataka) ko pehle hi amit shah kii taraf se chunaav kii jimmedaari saunpi ja chuki he

 The ruling Communist Party of China has proposed removing the two-term presidential term from the constitution
 isse sambhavat: raashtrapati shi jinping ko duusare kaarykaal ke baad bhi satta main bane rahane kaa rasta khul jayega
 Jinping's term is until 2023
 shinhua kii report ke mutabik chini communist party (sipisi) kii kendriya samiti ne desh ke samvidhan se is upbandh ko hataane kaa prastaav rakhaa he
 It has a provision for not more than two terms of the President and Vice President
 kaarykaal kii seemaa hataane ke prastaav par shanivaar hone vaale party ke purna adhiveshan main muhar lag sakati he
 With this, 64-year-old Xi Jinping, considered the most powerful ruler of modern China, is likely to get an unlimited tenure
 raashtrapati shi ne pichley saal sipisi kii rashtriya congress ke baad paanch saal ke apane duusare kaarykaal kii shuruyaat kii he
 He is also the head of CPC and Army
 pichley saal 7 sadasyeey jo netritv saamne aayaa tha usamen koi bhi unka bhavi uttaradhikari nahin he
 In such a situation, the possibility is reinforced that Xi intends to rule even after his second term
 tab se party ke sabhi ang ne pichley teen dashak se chale aa rahe samuhik netritv ke siddhant ko darkinar kar unhen party kaa shirshatam netaa ghoshit kar diya he
 Xi was elected party chief and president in 2013
 baad main unhone sena ke pramukh kii kaman bhi sanbhali thi
 In 2016, the CPC officially conferred on him the title of 'leader' leader
 paanch saal main ek baar hone vaali sipisi kii congress pichley saal shi kii vichaardhaara ko samvidhan main jagah dene par raji ho gayi thi
 This honor was reserved for Mao Tse Tung, the founder of modern China and his successor Deng Xiaoping
 vaise shi ke purvavarti jiyang jemin or hu jintao ke vichaar kaa samvidhan main ullekh he lekin unke naamon kaa zikr nahin he
 At present, any attempt to challenge Xi or his thinking will be considered against the party
 aaj kii ghoshnaa ke mahaj kuch minute baad shinhua ne khabar di ki party ne samvidhan main shi kaa raajnneetik siddhant - nae yug ke liye chini visheshtaon ke saath samaajwaad par shi chinafing vichaar likhane kaa prastaav rakhaa he
 The party has planned to include the newly empowered anti-corruption body 'national Supervisory Commission' as the new agency of the government in the Constitution
 main kota kii koching claason dwaara bahuviklpi prashnon, yani multiple chwais queshchans (multiple Choice Questions yaa MCQ) par zarurat se zyaada utsaah ke saath focus kiye jane ko vidhyaarthiyon, or antat IIT ke liye bhi hanikaarak tathaa vidhwanskaari bataata rahaa hum
 The really big question is why iits still use a format of multiple choice questions for the entrance exam or JEE
 yah format mashin dwaara grading ko sambhav banane ke liye apanaaya gaya tha, or phir lagaataar badhati aavedakon kii sankhya kii vajah se zarurat ban gaya
 Evaluation of the papers in which every 'long' answer had to be read was becoming impossible, as the iits did not have sufficient resources to test the paper manually
 is samasya kaa ek sambhav hal yah tha ki is kaam ko outsource kar diya jaae, lekin IIT apni pariksha kii nishpakshta kii ji-jaan se hifaazat karti rahi hai, or kabhi kisi bahari agency ko shaamil nahin kiya
 It may also be that at the time the MCQ format was adopted almost 12 years ago, no one had imagined that it would cause such serious problems
 ab jo ahm kaam kiya janaa he, vah he pariksha ke pattern main badlaav, taaki MCQ main mashin se jaanche ja sakane vaale kisi sahi jawaab ko jaays tehraane ke liye jawaab tak pahunchane kii prakriya bhi vistaar se dikhaani hogi
 Whichever candidate will give the right answer, their process of accessing the answer will also be tested manually, which means - resources will be required only for the students, whose answers will be correct, and those who dissuade themselves from this process will prove themselves wrong
 Will be done
 jawaab galat hone ke baavjood jawaab tak pahunchane kaa sahi tarika apnaane ke liye bhi kuch ank die ja sakate hai
 Perhaps some questions can also be prepared in such a way that the answers come in numbers, which have to be written in the box (it will be very easy to adopt in the online system), and all those answers will be given points, which are correct to an extent, Provided that the way to reach the answer is found to be correct
 jawaab tak pahunchane ke tareeke ko tabhi jaancha jaae, jab jawaab sweekaarya ho
 This kind of examination, which will also test the way students approach the answers, will be much harder to teach (coaching), and stop the coaching industry's tendency to sell ire's dream to every array
 Can apply
 jahaan tak abhyarthiyon kaa sawaal he, badale hue pariksha pattern ke hisaab se adhyayan karnaa (jinamein vistrut jawaab bhi shaamil honge) unhen khud kii vaastavik kshamtaaon or yogyataon ko jaanchane kaa mauka degaa
 The 'success' achieved by solving MCQ questions can lead to wrong self-assessment in students about their abilities, which will raise wrong expectations
 khud ke prati aisi galatfahami hona us sthiti main aasaan nahin hoga, jab vistrut jawaab likhane honge, jinke liye vishay kii moolbhoot jaankaree kii zarurat hoti he
 Another suggestion has been made for reforms, but it was never seriously discussed or debated
 is suzav ke centre main he JEE rank kii ahmiyat ko gata dena, or pravesh ke samay shakhaaen aavantit karte hue JEE rank kaa istemaal nahin kiya janaa
 In place of JEE rank, branch should be made the basis of allocating marks to the marks obtained by the students in the first year
 isse na keval IIT-JEE main sheersh rank hasil karne kii maaramaari khatm hogi - saath hi kuch had tak koching topper banane kaa dabaav bhi - balki isse IIT main pahunchane ke baad vidhyaarthee pehle saal main padhai par puri tarah focus karne ke liye 'majaboor' honge
 Another benefit from this would be that some students may choose branches in which they are actually interested, instead of copying the worn-out trends of previous years
 beshak, is vichaar par bhi aage vistaar se vichaar kiye jane kii zarurat he, kyonki isamen bahut-si sambhaavnaaen hongi, jaise sheersh 10,000 vidhyaarthiyon ko alag-alag IIT main bhej diya jayega, yaa vidhyaarthiyon ko (JEE rank ke mutabik) apni pasand kaa santhaan chunane kaa vikalp diya jaae, shakha nahin
 These views can be opposed, as this will erode the current balance, especially to end the highly sought-after 'institution-branch-jee rank' combination (eg IIT Bombay - Computer Science - Top 100 rank)
 ek or chintaa jo aksar saamne aati he, vah he ki kyon IIT-JEE ko itnaa kathin hona chahie
 First of all, IIT-JEE is broadly based on the same syllabus that CBSE teaches up to 12th standard, so it is not factually correct to say that it covers topics in a very broad manner
 duusare, IIT-JEE ke 'kathin' hone kaa aarope board parikshaon se tulana kar lagaaya jaataa he
 This comparison is wrong, because the two exams are different in many ways - the purpose of any competitive exam is to select candidates in the merit list, so it has to be deliberately made more challenging than the board exam, because of the board exam The purpose is to know only how much the student knows about their subject
 iske alaava, board pariksha aamtaur par paryaapt rup se vishleshnatmak nahin hotin, or ve 'sakht' or 'ratta lagane' (ratane) vaale tareeke par aadhaarit hoti hai
 So, on the contrary, any question paper that needs to think, understand the subject deeply, will only create problems
 adarsh rup se kisi bhi paryaapt rup se sakasham vidhyaarthee - jise board pariksha main achche ank hasil hue hon - ko kisi pratiyogi pariksha main bhi acha nateeja hasil karne main sakasham hona chahie
 But because of the limitations on which we have mentioned above, it is not necessary that every board topper has a clear subject in mind, and has analytical qualities
 so, IIT-JEE main puche jane vaale sawaal mushkil hote hai
 For this reason, asking institutions to 'adjust' their entrance examination according to the board examination is not a valid proposal
 tisare, merit list taiyaar karne ke uddeshy se lee jane vaali kisi bhi pariksha kii moolbhoot khaasiyat uskaa 'kathin' hona hi hota he
 If we make it very 'simple', then the number of people with high marks will be very high, and if it is made 'very difficult', then the students' mobilization will be towards those who score less
 donon hi nattejey vidhyaarthiyon kii rank suchi banane main sahaayak siddh nahin ho sakate, so, sahi tareeke se taiyaar kii gai pratiyogi pariksha ko kahin bich kaa rasta hi apnaanaa hoga, or hameshaa 'kathin' hona hoga
 Even in the era before MCQ, the IIT-JEE exam was more difficult than now, and the reason was that in-depth study had to be done for long questions at that time, whereas in the current format a few minutes for each question Are given, which means that the questions asked are less complex
 in kadamon se koching khatm nahin ho jaaegi
 As long as there is insufficient and poor schooling, and there will be a huge gap in the number of candidates and seats available, all types of coaching, including the quota type, will flourish
 yaad rakhen, sirf acchhee schuli shiksha hi unhen apraasangik bana sakati he

 *** As soon as the Mahabharata of 2019 is announced, the battle has started on election dates too
 kuch vipakshi dal jahaan centre sarkaar ke prabhaav kaa aarope lagaate hue chunaav ghoshnaa kii timming par sawaal uthaa rahe hai to vahiin pavitra maah ramajaan ke dauraan voting par bhi siyaasi bayaanbaji hone lagi he
 This is mainly due to voting in 169 Lok Sabha seats out of total 543 during Ramadan
 khaskar upi, bihar, pashchim bengal or dilli kii adhiktar siton par aakhri teen charan main hi matdaan hona he
 Announcing the election dates on March 10, Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora said that this time Lok Sabha elections will be held in seven phases
 11 april ko pehle charan kii voting ke baad 18 april, 23 april, 29 april, 6 may, 12 may or 19 may ko baaki charnon kii voting honi he
 This year, the month of Ramadan is starting from May 5
 yani 6, 12 or 19 may ko hone vaali aakhri teen charnon kii voting ramajaan ke dauraan hogi
 Since Muslim society during Ramadan keeps fasting without eating anything from dawn to dusk, questions are being raised as to how Muslim voters will be able to participate in voting for hours during the fast and hot summer
 
 agar aisa hua to in rajyon ke muslim bahul ilaakon main voting kaa pratishat kam rah saktaa he or agar voting kaa ganit aisa rahaa to sthaneey taur par muslim matadaata jin partiyon ko bhi vot dete hai, unki virdohi party ke ummidavaaron ko iskaa phayda mil saktaa he
 Islamic scholar expressed the objections: Islamic scholar and Imam of Lucknow Idgah and Shaharkazi Maulana Khalid Rashid Farangi Mahli have expressed strong resentment about the Lok Sabha elections to be held from May 6 to May 19
 unhone kaha he ki 5 may ko musalamaanon ke sabase pavitra maheene ramajaan kaa chand dekha jayega
 If the moon is visible then the fast will start from 6 May
 unhone kaha ki roje ke dauraan desh main 6 may, 12 may va 19 may ko matdaan hoga, jisase desh ke karodon rojedaaron ko pareshaani hogi
 However, while announcing the election, CEC Sunil Arora said that the date has been fixed keeping in mind the festivals
 moulana khalid rashid firangi ne ye bhi kaha ki chunaav ayog ko desh ke musalamaanon kaa khyaal rakhte hue chunaav kaarykram tay karnaa chahie tha
 He has demanded the Election Commission to consider changing the date of voting to be held on May 6, 12 and 19
 chunaav par pad saktaa he kitna asarmaana ja rahaa he ki desh ke teen bade rajyon upi, bihar or pashchim bengal main ramajaan ke dauraan voting kaa zyada asar dekha ja saktaa he
 These three states are not only large in terms of the number of Lok Sabha seats, but the population of Muslims also plays a decisive role here
 dilachasp baat ye he ki in teenon rajyon main hi sirf saaton charan main chunaav honge
 Uttar Pradesh - Voting during Ramadan on 41 seats will be held on May 6, in the fifth phase a total of 14 seats will be voted on
 inamen dhaurhara, sitapur, mohanlalganj (su
 ), Lucknow, Rae Bareli, Amethi, Banda, Fatehpur, Kaushambi (su
 ), barabanki (su
 ), Faizabad, Bahraich, Kaiserganj and Gonda will go to the polls
 12 maiko chathe charan main sultanpur, pratapgarh, phulpur, elahabaad, ambedkar nagar, shravasti, dumriyaganj, basti, santakabeernagar, lalganj (su
 ), Azamgarh, Jaunpur, Fish City (su
 ) or bhadohi samet kul 14 siton ke liye matdaan hoga
 May 19 In the seventh phase, Maharajganj, Gorakhpur Kushinagar Deoria Bansgaon (su
 ), ghosi salempur baliya gajipur chandauli varanasi mirzapur or robertsganj (su
 ) Will vote for a total of 13 seats
 yani ramajaan ke dauraan upi kii kul 80 siton main 41 loksabhaa siton par matdaan hona he
 Bihar - Voting on 21 seats during Ramadan will be held on May 6 in Sitamarhi, Madhubani, Muzaffarpur, Saran and Hajipur
 jabaki12 maiko valmikinagar, pashchim champaran, purvi champaran, shivahar, vaishali, gopalganj, siwan or maharajaganj siton par matdaan hoga
 Voting will be held on May 19 in Patna Sahib, Nalanda, Pataliputra, Ara, Buxar, Sasaram, Jehanabad and Karakat
 yani aakhri teen charnon main ramajaan ke dauraan bihar kii kul 40 siton main se 21 siton par voting hogi
 West Bengal and Delhi - There are a total of 42 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal, voting on 31 seats during Ramadan
 is baar yahaan 6 may ko paanchaven charan ke tahat 7, 12 may ko chathe charan ke tahat 8 seat or 19 may ko saatven charan ke tahat 9 siton par matdaan hona he yani ramajaan ke dauraan kul 24 siton par matdaan hoga
 Apart from this, voting on all the seven seats of Delhi will be held on May 12
 bataa den ki bihar main 17 fisadi musalmaan, upi main 20 fisadi or pashchim bengal main 27 fisadi ke lagbhag muslim aabaadi he
 If we look at the political equation of these three states, the BJP unilaterally won 71 seats in the 2014 elections in UP, while the situation is different in this election
 sapa-basapa donon ek saath aa gaye hai, jisase ye anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa he ki bijepi ke khilaaf dalit or muslim va yadav voter ek saath aa sakate hai
 In Bihar too, Lalu Prasad Yadav's RJD has joined hands with Congress, RLSP and Jitan Ram Manjhi, raising the challenge for BJP-JDU alliance
 pashchim bengal main trinmul congress netaa mamata banerjee kaa ecchhatra raaj he
 Despite the Modi wave in 2014, TMC won 34 seats in 42 seats
 tiemasi netaa ne uthaae savalkolkata ke meyar or tiemasi netaa farhaad hakim ne kaha ki bihar, upi or bengal main saat charan main chunaav hone hai or in teenon rajyon main alpsankhyak aabaadi kaaphi zyada he
 He said that voting must be done during the fast, the Election Commission should have taken care of it
 farhaad hakim ne ye bhi aarope lagaaya ki bijepi nahin chaahati ki alpsankhyak apana vot karen
 AAP MLA said- BJP will be benefited Apart from Muslim religious leader, Aam Aadmi Party's Muslim face in Delhi and MLA from Okhla Assembly seat Amanatullah Khan has also raised questions on voting during Ramadan
 unhone iskaa sidhaa phayda bijepi ko milane kaa daawa kiya he
 Amanatullah tweeted in this regard, wrote, 'may 12 will be Ramzan in Delhi, Muslims will reduce votes, BJP will directly benefit from this
 '12 may kaa din hoga dilli main ramadan hoga musalmaan vot kam karegaa iskaa sidhaa phayda bijepi ko hoga
 - Amanatullah Khan AAP (@khanamanatullah) March 10, 2019 An interesting statistic is that more than half of the seats, especially in the three big states (UP, Bihar, Bengal) are to be voted on during the last three phases i
e
 Ramadan
 inke alaava rajasthan kii 12 seat, madhya pradesh kii 23, jharkhand kii 11 or haryana kii 10 seat, jammu-kashmir kii 2, punjab kii 13, chandigarh or himachal kii 4 siton par bhi ramajaan ke dauraan voting honi he
 Voting is also to be held during Ramadan
 haalanki, ramajaan kaa voting par kitna fark padegaa yah nahin kaha ja saktaa, lekin 2018 main pashchim upi kii kairana loksabhaa seat or nurpur vidhansabha seat par hue upachunaav main halaat alag dekhne ko mili the
 In Kairana, people from the Muslim community were seen standing at the polling booth despite EVM malfunctions, even they did rosa-iftar in the evening

 In a direct communication with the presidents and directors of private medical colleges and dental colleges in the state, Hardia said that the aim is to ensure better coordination between private institutions and medical education department
 samvaad ke baad hardia ne pramukh sachiv chikitsa shiksha kii adhyakshata main ek samiti ke gathan kii ghoshnaa kii jisamen nijee medical or dental kalejon ke pratinidhi bhi shaamil rahenge
 The first meeting of the committee will be held on 19 December, in which the problems of these institutions will be considered
 samvaad ke dauraan nijee chikitsa evam dental kalejon ke adhyakshon tathaa nideshkon ne pravesh, fees or anya sambandhit muddon par apana paksh rakhaa
 He believed that the fees in private medical colleges were low, which made him uncomfortable in college operations with excellence

 See here - recruitment notification film rivyuhamashkalsactorsaf ali khan, ritesh deshmukh, ram kapur, bipasha basu, tamanna bhaatia, isha gupta, chanki pandeydyrectarasajid khandurationah2 ghante 39 minteretin5 main 0 starishwar kii satta par mujhe ek baar phir se yakeen ho gaya
 Due to his strength, i spent 159 minutes of my life and youth during Sajid Khan's film Humshakals without any major personal mishap
 varna apni haisiyat hi kya thi jo sajid ke is kahar ko jhel pate
 One more thing before i start the review
 main koi tismar khan kissago to nahin
 But if Sajid Khan dares to make a film once again, i can write a lot of scenes in advance
 nayak kuch honge, magar unke chaar chaar dabl role honge
 They would ring from time to time with something like current or snake or gong
 baar main ek mujra tip gaanaa hoga
 The palatial house will have a night dress song
 or clymex anivaary rup se aisa hoga, jisamen british rajpariwaar ke kuch numaayinde najar aaenge or bodi harakatein karenge
 And yes, Chunky Pandey will once again surprise you with his lousy role
 us film main hamashakals, himmatwala or tismar khan kaa majaak bhi banegaa
 Click here to read the movie review of 'chaal Bhaag'
 The story is nothing but the ability to understand what was served in the name of the story
 ashok arbapati he
 His father is in a coma
 ashok standap kamedian he, utana hi acha, jitne diarector sajid khan hai camere ke peeche
 Ashoka also has a family man
 uskaa naam kumaar he
 Whose Yarana is with Ashok's secretary Misty
 prakruti ke khel niraale hai, isliye ek sho koun banegaa miliener kii ankar shanaya ashok ke pije (pur jokes) par betahasha hansatii he or phir use ashok se pyaar bhi ho jaataa he
 Villain needed to bring a twist to this happy story
 enter mamaa ji jinka naam he kunwar anand narayan singh urf kansa
 Mama wants to grab Ashok's property
 isliye vah jaanwaron par ajeebogareeb prayog karne vaale doctor khan kii madad se ashok ke pani main aisa chemical mila dete hai, jisase vah kutton si harakat karne lagata he
 If Kumar is a man, he will drink this water too
 donon kute, maaf kiijie insaan paagalakhaane pahunch jate hai
 Where he encounters Hitler's devotee Varden YM Yamaraj
 is paagalakhaane main do or pagal hai, jo kabhi paranthe banaate the
 Their names are also Ashok and Kumar
 yahaan ek maha khatarnaak kaidi bhi he, jo mamaji kaa hamshakal he
 The time is running out of their mental asylum and to expose Mama Ji's plot that another pair comes to the fore
 doctor khan ne apane do bhounde dhang se dikhaae gaye samalangik assistant ko plastic surgery kar ashok kumaar bana diya he
 And Ashok Ki Made's indigenous disc bar is a Punjabi bhai Mama Ji's Hamshakala
 to phir jheliye teen teen hamashakals
 If you are a human, you will have love
 paaglon ke hisse kaa pyaar karne liye ek khubasurat doctor sahiba bhi hai
 Some of the conspiracies of Mama ji have survived, so is the cocaine smuggler, who apparently owns the parantha shop
 hansaane main kuch kami rah gai kya
 The two dwarf bodyguards of this smuggler might make up this shortcoming
 film main sajid khan ne bahut saahas dikhaakar do sach bole hai
 First, Sajid Khan's previous film Himmatwala is shown to give the highest degree of torture to the lunatics
 doosraa, ant main nae paaglon ko or bhi torchar karne ke liye sajid khan kii bahan farha khan kii pichhali film tismar khan dikhaai jaati he
 And who still hasn't gone mad, he should look for Humshakals
 saf ali khan film ke pramotion ke dauraan apane baar girl shot ke liye vexing karwaane ke anubhav sabko sunaate phire hai
 But has his mind also waxed, which he accepted this film
 ritesh deshmukh bhi sefu bhaiya kii hi qatari main khadey hai
 Ram Kapoor has tried to lift the film very well on the strong shoulders of his strong body
 magar ye unke dieting plan kii tarah hi aundhe munh giri he
 Bipasha, Tamannaah and Isha are there for the glamor burst and there was no hope from the trio itself
 unhone hamaari ummiido par khara utar bande kaa maan badhaayaa he
 The song 'tujhe Apni Bana Loon' has become a hit in the songs of the film
 baaki gane himesh reshmia kii sangeet pratibha kaa marsia padhane main kaam aaenge
 Sajid Khan has once again tried to revisit London
 to kya hua jo zyaadaatar sets aapako unki pichhali filmon ke banaae or bachaae hue najar aate hai
 And what about his directorial talent
 allaah, is vir balak ko barkat bakhshae
 But not at the cost of the audience's hard-earned money
 film hamashakals is saal kii nahin, is dashak kii nahin, is sadi kii sabase ghatiya filmon main shumaar hogi
 i do not believe so, quite sure
 agar phir bhi koi himmatwala he, to jaae or ise dekhe
 Because the comedy happens after the film is over, when Ashok and Kumar say after showing the incidents that happened during the shooting, the film Jao Bhai ended
 ab jaao
 We went to hell, but the audience would not go to see it
 abhi isamen or bhi badhotaree honi he
 In the same sequence, these recruitments are also being seen
 (input ieenes se) If Gautam Gambhir is unfit, the problem of opening will arise in front of Team India
 virendra sahvaag pehle hi team main nahin he aise main team ko first chwis, second chwis nahin balki third chwis openar ke saath maidan par utarana hoga
 In this case, Parthiv Patel and Sachin Tendulkar will have the responsibility to give the team a good start
 parthiv ke abhyaas maichon main behatar pradarshan karke unke form main hone kaa sanket de diya he
 But the concern is about Sachin Tendulkar who neither did anything great in Test matches nor did he bat in the subsequent practice match

 " There is tremendous competition in the SUV world

 According to the latest figures, Mahindra & Mahindra's popular Scorpio has once again secured the first position in the SUV market
 usne reno ke duster or ford ke ecosport ko peeche chhod diya he
 This information has been given by an economic newspaper

 Mahindra & Mahindra sold 50,900 Scorpio suvs during the period, while the Duster finished second and sold 46,700

 Ford's production of this successful car did not meet demand and still has a waiting list
 mahindra and mahindra ne is saal march main sabase zyada scorpiyo bechi

 Apart from this, political parties also bought this car due to elections

 unhone kaha ki donon hi alag tarah ke utpaada hai or inke kharidaar bhi alag tarah ke hai
 According to him, sales of Duster are increasing

 Today we are going to tell you about the vending machine
 ab aap soch rahe honge bhala usamen jaanane vaala kya he? to ham aapako bataa den ki ham naa to soft drinks vending mashin kii baat kar rahe hai naa hi chips vending mashin kii
 We are talking about the vending machine that will offer luxury cars like Bentley, Ferrari and Lamborghini
 myne nahin rakhti 18 saal kii driving, jaane kyon nahin he lamborgini chalaanaa bharat main aasanji haa ham baat kar rahe hai car vending mashin kii
 This will be a vending machine in Singapore

 So happy to see a gate named after you 2 / 2 congress adhyaksh pad se rahul gandhi ke istipha dene ke baad sonia gandhi antarim adhyaksh baniin hai
 The command of the party has come back to him in a time when the Congress is going through a bad phase
 yah sanyog he ki jab 1998 main pehali baar party netaaon ke anurodh or dabaav main vah adhyaksh baniin thim tab bhi congress kii sthiti kharaab thi
 At that time the party had only 141 Lok Sabha members
 ab jab duusari baar party main jari sankat ke samay unke haath kaman ai he to sirf 52 loksabhaa sadsy hai
 In the account of the longest-serving president, Sonia Gandhi is credited with sending the Congress to power at the Center twice
 sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya congress kii antarim adhyaksh banane ke baad sonia gandhi bijepi ke mukaable bikhare vipaksh ko ekajute kar sakengi
 Or will it be able to reinvigorate the weakened UPA due to lack of coordination in Rahul Gandhi's 20-month tenure
 sawaal isliye bhi uth rahe hai ki 2014 main 44 ke mukaable bhale hi rahul gandhi ne party ko 2019 main 52 siten dilaain, magar wo na vipaksh ko ekajute rakh sake or na hi upie ke sahyogi dalon ke bich uchit samanvay kar use majbootee de sake
 This is the reason that most of the effective regional parties in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, apart from the Congress, are seen to have their own voice
 'vipaksh ke paas nae vichaaron kaa aujaar hona chahie'varisht patrkaar urmilesh kehete hai ki aaj hindutv or karporate ke gathbandhan kii buniyaad par khadi bijepi kaa vipaksh tabhi muqabla kar saktaa he, jab uske paas nae vichaaron kaa aujaar ho
 Unless the opposition adopts a new style of implementing new ideas on the ground, the BJP and the central government, which are on the foundation of the existing Hindutva-corporate alliance, cannot be challenged
 kya rahul gandhi ke mukaable, sonia gandhi congress ke jhande tale vipaksh ko ekajute kar saktin hai? is sawaal par urmilesh kaa kahana he ki sonia gandhi vyaavhaarik zyada hai, idological kam
 While Rahul Gandhi is more ideological and less practical
 ho saktaa he upie yaa vipaksh ko majboot karne main sonia kaa vyaavhaarik paksh kaam aae
 But comparing Sonia and Rahul as president is not logical
 rahul gandhi congress ko inclusive (samaveshi) party bananaa chaahate the, unhone sanghathanaatmak str par isaki shuruyaat karne kii koshish kii
 Work was started towards creating a new party of new era
 yah digar he ki vah yah nahin kar paae
 As far as Sonia is concerned, the situation today and 2004 was different
 tab satta main vaajapeyi kii apane dam vaali bijepi sarkaar nahin thi
 There was disappointment in the public with some decisions of the coalition government, then the RSS was not as solid and aggressive campaign than today
 hindutv or karporate kaa gathbandhan nahin tha
 At the same time, images of Dalit, leaders of regional parties doing OBC politics were not so bad before
 in sab samikarnon ne tab sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (upie) banane kii raah aasaan kar di
 With which Sonia Gandhi succeeded in forming an anti-bjp alliance
 jabaki rahul gandhi ke samay bijepi prachand bahumat se satta main rahi
 Where did the UPA 2014 Lok Sabha elections take place in 2014 to 2019, when Sonia Gandhi was the president of the Congress
 us dauraan congress ko sirf 44 siten milin thim, vahiin upie sirf 60 siton tak pahunch saki thi
 While Rahul Gandhi was the president during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 is dauraan congress ko 52 siten milin, vahiin upie kii siten badhkar 91 ho gayi
 The Congress was successful in forming governments in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan during the era of Rahul Gandhi
 offis ke maahaul ko behatar banane main bos or aapke bich kaa rishta bahut myne rakhata he
 Regardless of how good you are at work, but if your relationship with the boss is bad, it can be harmful to your career and job
 vahiin jahaan tak bos ko impress karne kii baat he to is maamle main chamachagiri nahin chalegi
 But you have to be serious about these 7 things
 1
 Understand your boss's responsibilities and concerns
 kaam ko is tarah se karen ki aap unki praathamiktaaon se khud ko jod paaen
 These 7 important questions are asked in every interview, thus answer 2
 bos kii kharaab chizon par dhyaan naa den, unki positive chizon par dhyaan den
 With this one quality, you can come closer to your boss
 3
 Inform the boss about how well you are doing at work and what new plans you are making
 4
 It is not wrong to apologize if a mistake is made
 aisa karne par pataa chalata he ki aap ghamandi nahin hai or har vakt bos kaa feedback lene ke liye taiyaar rahete hai
 Such questions are asked in IAS interview, the answer is quite interesting 5
 lunch or coffee ke liye kabhi-kabhaar aap bos ke saath baahar jaaen
 By doing this a good relationship is formed between you
 6
 Always remember that there is a boss above your boss too, whose job is to make your boss happy
 aise main apane bos kaa torget puraa karne main unki madad karen
 In this way, you will be elevated in the eyes of Big Boss and your boss
 7
 At the time when everyone in the office is praising your success, you should not forget to appreciate your boss because no employee can move forward without the help and encouragement of the boss

 hindu panchang ke anusaar aaj jivitaputrika vrath he
 It is also called Jiutia fast in some parts of India
 yah nirjala vrath hota he, jise vivaahit mahilaayein apni santan kii lambii umr ke liye karti hai
 This fast is observed on the Ashtami of Krishna Paksha, the month of Ashwin
 haalanki hindu panchang main yah teenon tak manaaya jaataa he
 It starts from the seventh day of the Kusha Paksha and continues till the Navami
 bilkul chhath vrath kii tarah hi is vrath main pehle din nahaay khaay hota he
 Nirjala fast on the second day and Parana on the third day
 yah vrath khaastaur se bihar, uttar pradesh or nepal main prachlit he
 This Barjiutia fast begins from 01:01 am to 22:48 pm on 13 September
 darasal, ashtami isi muhoort main lag rahaa he
 Hence Jiutia fast or Jitiya fast will also be in this Muhurta
 kaise karen paranjiutiya vrath kaa parankarne se pehle snaan dhyaan karen or vidhi purvak pujan karen
 After this, break the fast by eating bread of Maduva
 jhor bhaat, noni kaa saag or madua kii roti khaakar bhi paaran karne kaa vidhaan he
 What is important is that eagles and fox were roaming in a forest
 tabhi unhone kuch logon kojiutiya vratakarte or uski katha padhate dekha
 The eagle looked at Jiutia's worship method very carefully and heard the story
 lekin lomadee kaa is ore kam hi dhyaan tha
 After this, the child of the eagle got the boon of longevity and this is the reason why the eagle has a long life
 vahiin lomadee kii santan jivit nahin bachi
 Thus, this fast is said to have a lot of importance
 ise karne vaali maa kii santan ko lambii aayu kaa vardaan miltaa he or vah sadaiv durghatnaon or sankaton se bachaa rahata he
 The fast Kathayh fast is associated with the Mahabharata period
 mahabharat yuddh ke baad ashwathama apane pita ke marane par shokakul tha
 He was determined to avenge it and upon reaching the Pandavas' camp, he killed five people sleeping there
 usne sochaa ki paanchon pandavon kii usne hatya kar di
 But then the five Pandavas came and stood before him
 darasal, jin paanch logon kii usne hatya kii thi ve draupadi ke putr the
 Arjuna captures Ashwathama and snatches his divine gem from him
 ashwathama ke badale kii aag or bad gai or usne uttara ke garbh main pal rahi santan ko maarane ke liye brahmastra kaa prayog kiya
 It was impossible to kill the killing of Brahmastra, so Lord Krishna gave all his merits to the unborn child of Uttara and resurrected the child of Uttara again in the womb
 garbh main marakar jivit hone ke kaaran uskaa namjivitaputrikapada or aage jaakar yahi raja parakshit bana
 Since then this fast is observed
 jitiya vrath kii ye katha bhi he prachlitanarmada nadi ke paas kanchanabati naam kaa nagar tha
 The king there was Malayaketu
 narmada nadi ke pashchim disha main marubhumi thi, jise baluhata kaha jaataa tha
 There was a huge Pakar tree
 us par chil rahati thi
 Under the tree was Khodhar, in which Siyarin lived
 chil or siaarin, donon main dosti thi
 Once both of them resolved to do Jitiya fast
 phir donon ne bhagawanjiutvahan kii pujake liye nirjala vrath rakhaa
 On the day of the fast, the great businessman of that city died
 ab uskaa dah sanskaar usee marusthal par kiya gaya
 It was a dark night and it started pouring heavily
 kabhi bijli kadakati to kabhi badal garajte
 The storm had come
 siaarin ko ab bhukh lagane lagi thi
 Seeing the dead, she could not stop herself and her fast was broken
 par chil ne sanyam rakhaa or niyam va shraddha se agle din vrath kaa paaran kiyaphir agle janm main donon saheliyon ne brahman parivaar main putree ke rup main janm liya
 His father's name was Bhaskar
 chil, badi bahan bani or uskaa naam shilvati rakhaa gaya
 Sheelvati is married to Budhisen
 siyaaran, choti bahan ke rup main janmi or uskaa naam kapuravati rakhaa gaya
 He was married to King Malayeketu of that city
 ab kapuravati kanchanabati nagar kii rani ban gai
 With the blessings of Lord Jiutavahana, Sheelwati had seven sons
 par kapuravati ke sabhi bachche janm lete hi mar jate the
 After some time, the seven sons of Shilwati grew up
 ve sabhi raja ke darbar main kaam karne lage
 Kapuravati had a feeling of envy on seeing her
 usne raja se kahkar sabhi beton ke sar kaat die
 He ordered seven new utensils and placed them in it and covered it with red cloth and sent it to Shilwati
 yah dekh bhagwaan jiutvahan ne mitti se saaton bhaaiyon ke sar banaae or sabhi ke sir ko uske dhad se jodakar un par amrit chhidak diya
 This brought them to life
 saaton yuvak jinda ho gaye or ghar laut aae
 The severed Sir Rani sent them became fruit
 duusari ore rani kapuravati, buddhisen ke ghar se soochna paane ko vyakul thi
 When information did not come for long, Kapuravati herself went to her elder sister's house
 vahaan sabko jinda dekhakar vah sann rah gayi
 When he regained consciousness, he told the sister everything
 ab use apni galati par pachhtaawaa ho rahaa tha
 By the grace of Lord Jiutavahana, Sheelwati remembered the things of her previous birth
 vah kapuravati ko lekar usee pakad ke ped ke paas gayi or use sari baaten bataayin
 Kapuravati fainted and died
 jab raja ko isaki khabar mili to unhone usee jagah par jaakar pakad ke ped ke neeche kapuravati kaa dah-sanskaar kar diya

 The story of Sita Behera of the tribal poor family, Behra said - i am an electrician who climbs the tower, the story of Adivasi Sita Behera is to reach the hail from the floor
 behad garib parivaar kii ladki se ‘transmishan queen’ banane tak kaa sita kaa safar desh kii betiyon ke liye misaal he
 The story of Sita begins with a family living in a grass hut in Soran village of Berhampur
 parivaar ke machuaare mukhiya ke liye paanch bacchon ko do vakt kii roti khilaanaa bhi mumkin nahin tha
 Sita and her three sisters, a brother, had to sleep on an empty stomach for several nights
 haalat us vakt or mushkil ho gaye jab sita kii badi bahan pati kii maut hone kii vajah se do bacchon ke saath rahane ke liye is parivaar main aa gai
 Poverty taught Sita, "poverty taught them to look at things in a positive way
 kuch alag kar dikhaanaa bahut mushkil tha, lekin khone ko kuch nahin tha, is baat ne meraa aatmavishvaas badhaane main madad kii
 'sita wanted to prepare for the Civil Services Examination so that the family and the village could do something to change the situation
 lekin parivaar kii kharaab aarthik sthiti ko dekhte hue sita ke liye ye mumkin nahin tha
 In such a situation, Sita enrolled in ITI (industrial Training Institute), Behrampur
 sita ITI ke dinon ko yaad karte kahati hai ki do saal ke liye unhen 40,000 rupee kaa jo kul wajipha (stypend) odisha skill development athurity se mila, usase unhen college or hostel fees bharne main madad mili

 ITI-ITI kah kar tanjapurushon ke prabhutv vaale is kshetra main sita ko apni jagah banane ke liye kai saamaajik dikkaton kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa
 Whenever Sita came to her house in Soran village on vacation, the boys would make fun of her in the pants-shirt uniform of ITI
 saath hi ‘ITI’, ‘ITI’ kah kar tanj kasate
 According to Sita, it was as if being a girl had committed a sin by enrolling in ITI
 kisi takneekee santhaan main pravesh lene vaali sita gaanv kii pehali ladki thi or gaanv ke ladakon ko lagata tha ki aisa sirf ladke hi kar sakate hai
 Today, Sita feels proud while working as an electrician on an electric tower thirty feet high
 wo ab apane parivaar ke sadasyon ko acha rahan sahan de paa rahi hai, saath hi apane chote bahan-bhaaiyon ko acchhee shiksha bhi dilaa rahi hai

 She is a wonderful example of courage

 Especially for girls
 jab sita ITI main padhati thim to gaanv ke ladke use ITI, ITI kah kar pareshaan karte the
 Even his name was changed to ITI

 There are enemies in the village itself

 But now Sita is a success story
 badi samasya hamaare logon, hamaare pariwaron ke bich hi kaha jaataa he ki ye kaam ladakiyon ke liye nahin he
 50% of the population in India is women
 agar skill devlepment ke liye ladakiyon ko nahin bheja jaataa to samajha ja saktaa he ki ham kis disha main hai
 Sita Behera said, 'I am in the post of Junior Technician in OPTCL
 main bijli kii aapurti banaae rakhane ke liye tower par chadhati hum
 i am the first electrician from my village to climb the tower, because i am from a poor family, so i was desperately looking for a job

 sipiem darasal ise udaarikaran kii takaton ko majboot karne kii bahari koshish kii tarah dekh rahi he
 Basudev Acharya told NDTV that behind this story there is a liberalization lobby which wants the next government to move on the path of economic liberalization while some other leaders are taking a dig at it

 The NIH, considered one of the world's best health-related research institutes, is not the only decision-making institution of this kind
 nijee kshetra main anek logon ne pichley kuch maheenon main isi tarah ke faisle liye hai or ve bharat main apane clinical pareekshanon kii yojana ko radd kar rahe hai
 a report by mckinsey prepared for the USA India Chamber of Commerce in Boston, about a month before the NIH ratified its decision, found India's clinical trial policy to be the biggest bottleneck in the country's growing pharmaceutical industry

 Expressing concern about the new rules, NIH recently said in a statement that it wants clarification from India on this important subject
 enech ke pravaktaa ne kaha, ‘enech ko ummid he ki bhavishya ke badlaavon se adhyayan phir se shuru ho sakenge or ham apane nagarikon ke aapasi hiton ke liye bharat main apane sahyogiyon ke saath saajhedaari jari rakh sakenge
 a similar opinion was voiced by industry experts at the recent us-india bio-pharma and Health Summit 2013 organized by the USA India Chamber of Commerce in Boston
 unka kahana tha ki maujuuda niti or maahaul bharat main clinical pareekshan ke lihaaj se thik nahin he
 The lead author of the mckinsey report, Ajay Dhankhar, said that recent policies on compensation requirements for victims of clinical trials increase investment risk and create instability for both multinational and domestic pharmaceutical companies

 Anger was growing against UPA in Delhi and opposition parties were taking part in it
 congress tab banty hui thi or sarkaar ek aisi kaman main thi, jise nahin maaloom tha ki anna kii 'aandhi' se kaise nipta jaae
 Many experiments were done to deal with Anna, but most were unsuccessful
 tab anna us gusse ko shakl bhi de rahe the, jo congress ke khilaaf lagaataar taiyaar ho rahaa tha

 Once Arvind Kejriwal's army was with Anna on stage, he is no more
 vaise noujvaan chehre bhi nahin dikh rahe, jo puri takat se sarkaar ko jhukaane main jute jaaen
 Delhi now belongs to the AAP party, where it would be a political mistake to weaken Arvind's face by making Anna's movement hit

 unki zamin ke haq kii ladaai he
 This is an issue whereby the urban agitator was not directly connected with Arvind for the power, water and road fight

 agar aap bina seat belt yaa bina helmet ke safar kar rahe hai or soch rahe hai ki dilli trephic police ne aapako nahin dekha or aap chaalaan se batch gaye to saavdhaan kyonki ho saktaa he ki agle hi din aapako post se chaalaan ghar pe aa jaae
 This was possible because someone broke your traffic rules and shared your photo on the social media account of Delhi Police
 pichley saal november se is saal november tak kareeb 3,65,000 chaalaan post ke jariye bheje gaye
 At the same time, 2,88,623 invoices were cut this year from May to October in the last 6 months
 ye spot chaalaan nahin tha
 Joint CP of Delhi Traffic Police Alok Kumar said that due to the location of Jio with any photo, video on social media, we send the challan from the post
 trephic police ke centinel APP se bhi aam log trephic niyam todane kaa photo yaa video bhej rahe hai
 Let us tell you that all these crimes were of visible nature like driving without helmet, triple riding, defective number plate, stop line violations
 ek aankade ke mutabik dilli trephic police kii kareeb 6 hazaar sanction strength he lekin viviipi arrangement, lau and order or tyohaaron ke sizan main trephic police arrangement main bhi lagaai jaati he
 In such a situation, law breakers take advantage of the lack of policemen on the road

 i will say that i have given my head in Okhli but i did it because i am very much connected with this team and Australian cricket
